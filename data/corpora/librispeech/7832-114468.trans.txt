7832-114468-0000 THE SUN WAS SETTING ONCE MORE OVER THE VIRGINIA HILLS DESTINED TO BE SCARRED SO DEEPLY BY BATTLE BUT ATTACK AND DEFENSE WENT ON AS NIGHT CAME THE THUDDING OF CANNON ADDED TO THE TUMULT
7832-114468-0001 AND MASSES OF INFANTRY SUPPORTED BY HEAVY BATTERIES HAD TURNED TO PROTECT THE CROSSING THE SOUTHERN VANGUARD COULD NOT ASSAIL SUCH A POWERFUL FORCE AND BEFORE THE NIGHT WAS OVER THE WHOLE UNION ARMY
7832-114468-0002 AS MC CLELLAN'S HAD BEEN FORCED TO DRAW BACK AT THE SEVEN DAYS AND SATISFACTION THAT THEY WERE SAFE FOR THE TIME BEING AND COULD PREPARE FOR A NEW START BUT THE FEELING OF EXULTATION SOON PASSED
7832-114468-0003 AND GAVE WAY WHOLLY TO CHAGRIN THEY WERE RETREATING BEFORE AN ARMY NOT EXCEEDING THEIR OWN IN NUMBERS PERHAPS LESS THEY HAD ANOTHER GREAT FORCE THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
7832-114468-0004 AND THEN THEY COULD HAVE BADE DEFIANCE TO LEE AND JACKSON THE NORTH WITH ITS GREAT NUMBERS ITS FINE COURAGE AND ITS SPLENDID PATRIOTISM SHOULD NEVER BE RETREATING HE FELT ONCE MORE AS THOUSANDS OF OTHERS FELT
7832-114468-0005 THAT THE HAND ON THE REINS WAS NEITHER STRONG NOR SURE AND THAT THE GREAT TROUBLE LAY THERE THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE HIDING BEHIND A RIVER LEE AND JACKSON DID NOT DO IT DICK REMEMBERED THAT GRIM COMMANDER IN THE WEST
7832-114468-0006 THE SILENT GRANT AND HE DID NOT BELIEVE HE WOULD BE RETREATING LONG AFTER DARKNESS CAME THE FIRING CONTINUED BETWEEN SKIRMISHERS ACROSS THE STREAM BUT FINALLY IT TOO WANED
7832-114468-0007 HAD NOT THE CRASHES BEEN SO IRREGULAR HE STOOD UP RUBBED HIS EYES AND THEN LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE CAME THE CANNONADE HE SAW FROM THE CREST OF A HILL GREAT NUMBERS OF CONFEDERATE TROOPS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER
7832-114468-0008 IT WAS A STRANGE SIGHT TO DICK ONE THAT IS NOT LOOKED UPON OFTEN TWO GREAT ARMIES GAZING ACROSS A RIVER AT EACH OTHER AND SURE TO MEET SOONER OR LATER IN MORTAL COMBAT
7832-114468-0009 IT WAS THRILLING AWE INSPIRING BUT IT MADE HIS HEART MISS A BEAT OR TWO AT THE THOUGHT OF THE WOUNDS AND DEATH TO COME ALL THE MORE TERRIBLE BECAUSE THOSE WHO FOUGHT TOGETHER WERE OF THE SAME BLOOD AND THE SAME NATION
7832-114468-0010 WARNER AND PENNINGTON JOINED HIM ON THE HEIGHT WHERE HE STOOD AND THEY SAW THAT IN THE EARLY HOURS BEFORE DAWN THE NORTHERN GENERALS HAD NOT BEEN IDLE THE WHOLE ARMY OF POPE WAS MASSED ALONG THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER
7832-114468-0011 AND EVERY HIGH POINT WAS CROWNED WITH HEAVY BATTERIES OF ARTILLERY THERE HAD BEEN A LONG DROUGHT AND AT SOME POINTS THE RAPPAHANNOCK COULD BE FORDED BUT NOT IN THE FACE OF SUCH A DEFENCE AS THE NORTH HERE OFFERED
7832-114468-0012 WILL THEY TRY TO CROSS SIR ASKED DICK OF THE COLONEL I DON'T THINK SO BUT IF THEY DO WE OUGHT TO BEAT THEM BACK MEANWHILE DICK MY BOY EVERY DAY'S DELAY IS A FRESH CARD IN OUR HAND
7832-114468-0013 WHENCE IT CAN MARCH IN TWO DAYS TO A JUNCTION WITH US WHEN WE WOULD BECOME OVERWHELMING AND IRRESISTIBLE BUT I WISH IT DIDN'T TAKE SO LONG TO DISEMBARK AN ARMY THE NOTE OF ANXIETY IN HIS VOICE DID NOT ESCAPE DICK
7832-114468-0014 YOU WISH THEN TO BE SURE OF THE JUNCTION BETWEEN OUR TWO ARMIES BEFORE LEE AND JACKSON STRIKE YES DICK THAT IS WHAT IS ON MY MIND THE RETREAT OF THIS ARMY ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE CAUSED US CHAGRIN WAS MOST OPPORTUNE
7832-114468-0015 LEE AND JACKSON THEY SURELY HAVE A PLAN OF SOME KIND BUT WHAT IS IT HAVE WE ANY DEFINITE NEWS FROM THE OTHER SIDE SIR SHEPARD CAME IN THIS MORNING BUT LITTLE EVER ESCAPES HIM
7832-114468-0016 AND HE SAYS THAT THE WHOLE SOUTHERN ARMY IS UP ALL THEIR BEST LEADERS ARE THERE LEE AND JACKSON AND LONGSTREET AND THE HILLS AND EARLY AND LAWTON AND THE OTHERS
7832-114468-0017 DON'T YOU THINK WE COULD DO IT SIR COULDN'T GENERAL POPE RETREAT ON WASHINGTON THEN AND AS THEY CONTINUED TO FOLLOW US WE COULD TURN AND SPRING ON THEM WITH BOTH ARMIES BUT COLONEL WINCHESTER SHOOK HIS HEAD
7832-114468-0018 IT WOULD NEVER DO HE SAID ALL EUROPE EAGER TO SEE THE UNION SPLIT WOULD THEN HELP THE CONFEDERACY IN EVERY POSSIBLE MANNER THE OLD MONARCHIES WOULD SAY THAT
7832-114468-0019 WE'LL TRIUMPH IN THE END IT'S MY OWN FEELING DICK IT CANNOT IT MUST NOT BE ANY OTHER WAY DICK REMAINED UPBORNE BY A CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE RATHER THAN IN THE PRESENT
7832-114468-0020 AND THROUGHOUT THE MORNING HE REMAINED WITH HIS COMRADES UNDER ARMS BUT DOING LITTLE SAVE TO HEAR THE FITFUL FIRING WHICH RAN ALONG A FRONT OF SEVERAL MILES BUT LATER IN THE DAY A HEAVY CRASH CAME FROM A FORD
7832-114468-0021 FURTHER UP THE STREAM UNDER COVER OF A GREAT ARTILLERY FIRE STUART'S CAVALRY DASHED INTO THE FORD AND DROVE OFF THE INFANTRY AND A BATTERY POSTED TO DEFEND IT THEN THEY TRIUMPHANTLY PLACED HEAVY LINES OF PICKETS
7832-114468-0022 THEY CHARGED WITH SO MUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT STUART'S CAVALRY ABANDONED SUCH DANGEROUS GROUND ALL THE PICKETS WERE DRAWN IN AND THEY RETREATED IN HASTE ACROSS THE STREAM
7832-114468-0023 BUT THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON THEY LAY IDLE THE PITILESS AUGUST SUN BURNED ON AND THE DUST THAT HAD BEEN TRODDEN UP BY THE SCORES OF THOUSANDS HUNG IN CLOUDS LOW BUT ALMOST MOTIONLESS
7832-114468-0024 EMPTYING INTO THE RAPPAHANNOCK AND BATHED HIS FACE AND HANDS HUNDREDS OF OTHERS WERE DOING THE SAME THE WATER BROUGHT A GREAT RELIEF THEN HE WENT BACK TO COLONEL WINCHESTER AND HIS COMRADES AND WAITED PATIENTLY WITH THEM
7832-114468-0025 UNTIL EVENING HE REMEMBERED COLONEL WINCHESTER'S WORDS EARLIER IN THE DAY AND AS THE DARKNESS CAME HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT LEE AND JACKSON WERE THINKING
7832-114468-0026 BUT HE DISTINGUISHED ONLY A BLACK BACKGROUND AND THE DIM LIGHT OF FIRES DICK WAS NOT WRONG THE CONFEDERATE COMMANDERS DID HAVE A PLAN AND THE OMENS WHICH SEEMED SINISTER TO HIM WERE SINISTER IN FACT
7832-114468-0027 AND THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC NEARER TO RICHMOND THEIR OWN CAPITAL THAN THEY WERE NEVERTHELESS LEE FULL OF DARING DESPITE HIS YEARS FOLLOWED AND THE DANGERS WERE GROWING THICKER EVERY HOUR AROUND POPE
7832-114468-0028 THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CROSS THE RIVER AGAIN THE HOSTILE SCOUTS AND SHARPSHOOTERS HAD BECOME TOO VIGILANT YET HE WAS SURE THAT LEE AND JACKSON WOULD ATTEMPT TO FORCE A PASSAGE HIGHER UP WHERE THE DROUGHT HAD MADE GOOD FORDS
7832-114468-0029 IT'S WELL THAT WE'RE SHOWING VIGILANCE SAID COLONEL WINCHESTER TO DICK HE HAD FALLEN INTO THE HABIT OF TALKING MUCH AND CONFIDENTIALLY TO THE BOY BECAUSE HE LIKED AND TRUSTED HIM AND FOR ANOTHER REASON WHICH
7832-114468-0030 ASKED DICK BEYOND A DOUBT THEY HAVE EVERY REASON TO STRIKE BEFORE THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC CAN COME BESIDES IT IS IN ACCORD WITH THE CHARACTER OF THEIR GENERALS BOTH LEE AND JACKSON ARE ALWAYS FOR THE SWIFT OFFENSIVE
7832-114468-0031 AT A FORD A MILE ABOVE AND ALSO AT ANOTHER A MILE OR TWO FURTHER ON THE SOUTHERN TROOPS HAD BEGUN A HEAVY FIRE AND GATHERED IN STRONG MASSES WERE THREATENING EVERY MOMENT TO ATTEMPT THE PASSAGE
7832-114468-0032 BUT THE UNION GUNS POSTED ON HILLS MADE A VIGOROUS REPLY AND THE TIME PASSED IN HEAVY CANNONADES COLONEL WINCHESTER HIS BROWS KNITTED AND ANXIOUS
7832-114468-0033 HE CONFIDED AT LAST TO HIS FAVORITE AIDE HIS BELIEF THAT WHAT LAY BEHIND THE CANNONADE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CANNONADE ITSELF IT MUST BE A FEINT OR A BLIND HE SAID THEY FIRE A GREAT DEAL
7832-114468-0034 BUT THEY DON'T MAKE ANY DASH FOR THE STREAM NOW THE REBELS HAVEN'T AMMUNITION TO WASTE THEN
7832-114468-0035 THEY MUST BE SENDING A HEAVY FORCE HIGHER UP THE RIVER TO CROSS WHERE THERE IS NO RESISTANCE AND WE MUST MEET THEM THERE WITH MY REGIMENT ONLY IF WE CAN OBTAIN NO OTHER MEN THE COLONEL
7832-114468-0036 OBTAINED LEAVE TO GO UP THE RAPPAHANNOCK UNTIL NIGHTFALL BUT ONLY HIS OWN REGIMENT NOW REDUCED TO LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED MEN WAS ALLOTTED TO HIM IN TRUTH HIS DIVISION COMMANDER THOUGHT HIS PURPOSE USELESS
7832-114468-0037 BUT YIELDED TO THE INSISTENCE OF WINCHESTER WHO WAS KNOWN TO BE AN OFFICER OF GREAT MERIT IT SEEMED TO THE UNION GENERALS THAT THEY MUST DEFEND THE FORDS WHERE THE SOUTHERN ARMY LAY MASSED BEFORE THEM DICK LEARNED
7832-114468-0038 HAD THAT FORD IN MIND AND HE WAS GLAD TO BE WITH HIM ON THE MARCH TO IT
7832-114468-0039 WHICH THEY LEARNED AFTERWARD WAS BEING CARRIED ON BY LONGSTREET AND FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF THE STREAM AS FAST AS THEY COULD OVER THE HILLS AND THROUGH THE WOODS BUT WITH SO MANY OBSTACLES THEY MADE SLOW PROGRESS
7832-114468-0040 BUT IT APPLIES JUST AS IT DOES ON THE GREAT PLAINS IT MEANS THAT A STORM IS COMING ANYBODY COULD TELL THAT LOOK THERE IN THE SOUTHWEST SEE THAT CLOUD EDGING ITSELF OVER THE HORIZON
7832-114468-0041 THINGS WILL TURN LOOSE TO NIGHT DON'T YOU SAY THE SAME SERGEANT YOU'VE BEEN OUT IN MY COUNTRY SERGEANT WHITLEY WAS STANDING NEAR THEM REGARDING THE CLOUD ATTENTIVELY YES MISTER PENNINGTON HE REPLIED
7832-114468-0042 BUT HE SAW THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH IN EARNEST NOR WAS HE ONE TO UNDERRATE WEATHER EFFECTS UPON MOVEMENTS IN WAR WHAT WILL IT MEAN TO THE TWO ARMIES SERGEANT HE ASKED
7832-114468-0043 DEPENDS UPON WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE SHE BUSTS IF A REBEL FORCE IS THEN ACROSS IT'S BAD FOR US BUT IF IT AIN'T THE MORE WATER BETWEEN US AN THEM THE BETTER THIS I TAKE IT IS THE END OF THE DROUGHT
7832-114468-0044 AND A FLOOD WILL COME TUMBLING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS THE SUN NOW DARKENED AND THE CLOUDS GATHERED HEAVILY ON THE WESTERN HORIZON COLONEL WINCHESTER'S ANXIETY INCREASED FAST
7832-114468-0045 IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE REGIMENT COULD NOT REACH SULPHUR SPRINGS UNTIL FAR INTO THE NIGHT AND STILL FULL OF ALARMS HE RESOLVED TO TAKE A SMALL DETACHMENT CHIEFLY OF HIS STAFF
7832-114468-0046 AND RIDE FORWARD AT THE UTMOST SPEED HE CHOSE ABOUT TWENTY MEN INCLUDING DICK WARNER PENNINGTON SERGEANT WHITLEY AND ANOTHER VETERAN WHO WERE MOUNTED ON THE HORSES OF JUNIOR OFFICERS LEFT BEHIND
7832-114468-0047 AND PRESSED FORWARD WITH SPEED A WEST VIRGINIAN NAMED SHATTUCK KNEW SOMETHING OF THE COUNTRY AND LED THEM WHAT IS THIS PLACE SULPHUR SPRINGS ASKED COLONEL WINCHESTER OF SHATTUCK
7832-114468-0048 SOME BIG SULPHUR SPRINGS SPOUT OUT OF THE BANK AND RUN DOWN TO THE RIVER THEY ARE FINE AND HEALTHY TO DRINK AN THERE'S A LOT OF COTTAGES BUILT UP BY PEOPLE WHO COME THERE TO STAY A WHILE
7832-114468-0049 IT AIN'T NO PLACE FOR HEALTH JUST AT THIS TIME THAT'S A CERTAINTY SAID COLONEL WINCHESTER AN THEN THERE'S THE BRIDGE WHICH AS WE KNOW THE CAVALRY HAS BROKE DOWN FORTUNATELY BUT CAN'T WE GO A LITTLE FASTER BOYS
7832-114468-0050 THERE WAS A WELL DEFINED ROAD AND SHATTUCK NOW LED THEM AT A GALLOP AS THEY APPROACHED THE SPRINGS THEY CHECKED THEIR SPEED OWING TO THE INCREASING DARKNESS BUT DICK'S GOOD EARS SOON TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING AT THE SPRINGS
7832-114468-0051 AND ALL LISTENED INTENTLY IT WAS VERY DARK NOW AND THE WOOD WAS MOANING BUT THE COLUMNS OF AIR CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE WOOD BEARING CLEARLY UPON THEIR CREST THE NOISES MADE BY REGIMENTS
7832-114468-0052 MISTER SHATTUCK SAID COLONEL WINCHESTER HOW NEAR DO YOU THINK WE CAN APPROACH WITHOUT BEING SEEN I KNOW A NECK OF WOODS LEADING WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE COTTAGES IF WE WAS TO LEAVE OUR HORSES HERE WITH A COUPLE OF MEN
7832-114468-0053 WE COULD SLIP DOWN AMONG THE TREES AND BUSHES AND THERE AIN'T ONE CHANCE IN TEN THAT WE'D BE SEEN ON SO DARK A NIGHT THEN YOU LEAD US PAWLEY YOU AND WOODFALL HOLD THE HORSES NOW FOLLOW SOFTLY LADS
7832-114468-0054 AND WITHOUT NOISE BUT AS THEY ADVANCED THE SOUNDS OF AN ARMY AHEAD OF THEM INCREASED AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE EDGE OF THE COVERT THEY SAW A GREAT CONFEDERATE DIVISION ON THEIR SIDE OF THE STREAM IN FULL POSSESSION
