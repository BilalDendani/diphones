29-130626-0002 I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GET UP AT SIX SO I DID I ANSWERED
29-130626-0003 I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE I AM SURE BUT THE SIGHT OF ANOTHER MAN ASLEEP IN BED WHEN I AM UP MADDENS ME IT SEEMS TO ME SO SHOCKING TO SEE THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF A MAN'S LIFE THE PRICELESS MOMENTS THAT WILL NEVER COME BACK TO HIM AGAIN
29-130626-0004 BEING WASTED IN MERE BRUTISH SLEEP THERE WAS GEORGE THROWING AWAY IN HIDEOUS SLOTH THE INESTIMABLE GIFT OF TIME HIS VALUABLE LIFE EVERY SECOND OF WHICH HE WOULD HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR HEREAFTER PASSING AWAY FROM HIM
29-130626-0005 UNUSED HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UP STUFFING HIMSELF WITH EGGS AND BACON IRRITATING THE DOG OR FLIRTING WITH THE SLAVEY INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING THERE SUNK IN SOUL CLOGGING OBLIVION IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT
29-130626-0006 HARRIS AND I APPEARED TO BE STRUCK BY IT AT THE SAME INSTANT WE DETERMINED TO SAVE HIM AND IN THIS NOBLE RESOLVE OUR OWN DISPUTE WAS FORGOTTEN WE FLEW ACROSS AND SLUNG THE CLOTHES OFF HIM
29-130626-0007 AND HARRIS LANDED HIM ONE WITH A SLIPPER AND I SHOUTED IN HIS EAR AND HE AWOKE WASERMARRER HE OBSERVED SITTING UP GET UP YOU FAT HEADED CHUNK ROARED HARRIS
29-130626-0008 WHAT HE SHRIEKED JUMPING OUT OF BED INTO THE BATH WHO THE THUNDER PUT THIS THING HERE WE TOLD HIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN A FOOL NOT TO SEE THE BATH WE FINISHED DRESSING
29-130626-0009 WE TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT SHAVING THAT MORNING AS WE WEREN'T GOING TO UNPACK THAT BAG AGAIN FOR HIM NOR FOR ANYONE LIKE HIM HE SAID DON'T BE ABSURD HOW CAN I GO INTO THE CITY LIKE THIS
29-130626-0010 WE CALMED THEM WITH AN UMBRELLA AND SAT DOWN TO CHOPS AND COLD BEEF HARRIS SAID THE GREAT THING IS TO MAKE A GOOD BREAKFAST AND HE STARTED WITH A COUPLE OF CHOPS SAYING THAT HE WOULD TAKE THESE WHILE THEY WERE HOT
29-130626-0011 AS THE BEEF COULD WAIT GEORGE GOT HOLD OF THE PAPER AND READ US OUT THE BOATING FATALITIES
29-130626-0012 WITH GENERAL DEPRESSION OVER THE MIDLAND COUNTIES LONDON AND CHANNEL BAR FALLING I DO THINK THAT OF ALL THE SILLY IRRITATING TOMFOOLISHNESS BY WHICH WE ARE PLAGUED THIS WEATHER FORECAST FRAUD
29-130626-0013 IS ABOUT THE MOST AGGRAVATING IT FORECASTS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DAY I REMEMBER A HOLIDAY OF MINE BEING COMPLETELY RUINED ONE LATE AUTUMN
29-130626-0014 BY OUR PAYING ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER REPORT OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER HEAVY SHOWERS WITH THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE EXPECTED TO DAY IT WOULD SAY ON MONDAY AND SO WE WOULD GIVE UP OUR PICNIC AND STOP INDOORS ALL DAY WAITING FOR THE RAIN
29-130626-0015 AND PEOPLE WOULD PASS THE HOUSE GOING OFF IN WAGONETTES AND COACHES AS JOLLY AND MERRY AS COULD BE THE SUN SHINING OUT AND NOT A CLOUD TO BE SEEN AH WE SAID AS WE STOOD LOOKING OUT AT THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW WON'T THEY COME HOME SOAKED
29-130626-0016 AND WE CHUCKLED TO THINK HOW WET THEY WERE GOING TO GET AND CAME BACK AND STIRRED THE FIRE AND GOT OUR BOOKS AND ARRANGED OUR SPECIMENS OF SEAWEED AND COCKLE SHELLS BY TWELVE O'CLOCK WITH THE SUN POURING INTO THE ROOM THE HEAT BECAME QUITE OPPRESSIVE
29-130626-0017 THE LANDLADY WOULD COME IN TO ASK IF WE WEREN'T GOING OUT AS IT SEEMED SUCH A LOVELY DAY NO NO WE REPLIED WITH A KNOWING CHUCKLE NOT WE WE DON'T MEAN TO GET WET NO NO AND WHEN THE AFTERNOON WAS NEARLY GONE AND STILL THERE WAS NO SIGN OF RAIN
29-130626-0018 AND A LOVELY NIGHT AFTER IT THE NEXT MORNING WE WOULD READ THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A WARM FINE TO SET FAIR DAY MUCH HEAT AND WE WOULD DRESS OURSELVES IN FLIMSY THINGS
29-130626-0019 IT WOULD COMMENCE TO RAIN HARD AND A BITTERLY COLD WIND WOULD SPRING UP AND BOTH WOULD KEEP ON STEADILY FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND WE WOULD COME HOME WITH COLDS AND RHEUMATISM ALL OVER US AND GO TO BED
29-130626-0020 THE WEATHER IS A THING THAT IS BEYOND ME ALTOGETHER I NEVER CAN UNDERSTAND IT THE BAROMETER IS USELESS IT IS AS MISLEADING AS THE NEWSPAPER FORECAST
29-130626-0021 THERE WAS ONE HANGING UP IN A HOTEL AT OXFORD AT WHICH I WAS STAYING LAST SPRING AND WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS POINTING TO SET FAIR IT WAS SIMPLY POURING WITH RAIN OUTSIDE AND HAD BEEN ALL DAY AND I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE MATTERS OUT
29-130626-0022 AND IT JUMPED UP AND POINTED TO VERY DRY THE BOOTS STOPPED AS HE WAS PASSING AND SAID HE EXPECTED IT MEANT TO MORROW I FANCIED THAT MAYBE IT WAS THINKING OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST BUT BOOTS SAID NO HE THOUGHT NOT
29-130626-0023 I TAPPED IT AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING AND IT WENT UP STILL HIGHER AND THE RAIN CAME DOWN FASTER THAN EVER ON WEDNESDAY I WENT AND HIT IT AGAIN AND THE POINTER WENT ROUND TOWARDS SET FAIR VERY DRY AND
29-130626-0024 MUCH HEAT UNTIL IT WAS STOPPED BY THE PEG AND COULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER IT TRIED ITS BEST
29-130626-0025 WITHOUT BREAKING ITSELF IT EVIDENTLY WANTED TO GO ON AND PROGNOSTICATE DROUGHT AND WATER FAMINE AND SUNSTROKE AND SIMOOMS AND SUCH THINGS BUT THE PEG PREVENTED IT
29-130626-0026 BOOTS SAID IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PROLONGED SPELL OF GRAND WEATHER SOME TIME AND READ OUT A POEM WHICH WAS PRINTED OVER THE TOP OF THE ORACLE ABOUT LONG FORETOLD LONG LAST
29-130626-0027 SHORT NOTICE SOON PAST THE FINE WEATHER NEVER CAME THAT SUMMER I EXPECT THAT MACHINE MUST HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO THE FOLLOWING SPRING THEN THERE ARE THOSE NEW STYLE OF BAROMETERS
29-130626-0028 THE LONG STRAIGHT ONES I NEVER CAN MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF THOSE THERE IS ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M YESTERDAY AND ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M TO DAY BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET THERE AS EARLY AS TEN YOU KNOW
29-130626-0029 IT RISES OR FALLS FOR RAIN AND FINE WITH MUCH OR LESS WIND AND ONE END IS NLY
29-130626-0030 WHAT'S ELY GOT TO DO WITH IT AND IF YOU TAP IT
29-130626-0031 AND REDUCE IT TO FAHRENHEIT AND EVEN THEN I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT WHO WANTS TO BE FORETOLD THE WEATHER
29-130626-0032 WITHOUT OUR HAVING THE MISERY OF KNOWING ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND THE PROPHET WE LIKE IS THE OLD MAN WHO ON THE PARTICULARLY GLOOMY LOOKING MORNING OF SOME DAY WHEN WE PARTICULARLY WANT IT TO BE FINE LOOKS ROUND THE HORIZON WITH A PARTICULARLY KNOWING EYE

29-130626-0047 BUT ON CATCHING SIGHT OF HARRIS AND ME AND MONTMORENCY AND THE THINGS HE EASED UP AND STARED HARRIS AND I FROWNED AT HIM THIS MIGHT HAVE WOUNDED A MORE SENSITIVE NATURE
29-130626-0048 BUT BIGGS'S BOYS ARE NOT AS A RULE TOUCHY HE CAME TO A DEAD STOP A YARD FROM OUR STEP
29-130626-0049 AND SELECTING A STRAW TO CHEW FIXED US WITH HIS EYE HE EVIDENTLY MEANT TO SEE THIS THING OUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE GROCER'S BOY PASSED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET BIGGS'S BOY HAILED HIM
