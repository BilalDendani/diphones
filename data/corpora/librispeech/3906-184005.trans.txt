3906-184005-0000 SHE COULD ALMOST HAVE SMILED AT HER SCRUPLES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE AS SHE LOOKED BACK ON THEM THEY SEEMED TO BELONG TO THE OLD IGNORANT TIMOROUS TIME WHEN SHE HAD FEARED TO LOOK LIFE IN THE FACE AND HAD BEEN BLIND TO THE MYSTERIES AND CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART BECAUSE HER OWN HAD NOT BEEN REVEALED TO HER
3906-184005-0001 DARROW HAD SAID YOU WERE MADE TO FEEL EVERYTHING AND TO FEEL WAS SURELY BETTER THAN TO JUDGE WHEN SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS HE WAS ALREADY IN THE OAK ROOM WITH EFFIE AND MADAME DE CHANTELLE
3906-184005-0002 AND THE SENSE OF REASSURANCE WHICH HIS PRESENCE GAVE HER WAS MERGED IN THE RELIEF OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK OF WHAT WAS BETWEEN THEM BUT THERE IT WAS INEVITABLY AND WHENEVER THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THEY SAW IT IN HER DREAD OF GIVING IT A MORE TANGIBLE SHAPE
3906-184005-0003 SHE TRIED TO DEVISE MEANS OF KEEPING THE LITTLE GIRL WITH HER AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY BY THE NURSE FOUND AN EXCUSE FOR FOLLOWING MADAME DE CHANTELLE UPSTAIRS TO THE PURPLE SITTING ROOM
3906-184005-0004 OF WHICH ANNA COULD HARDLY YET BEAR TO CONSIDER THE VAGUEST OUTLINE THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF SAILING FROM LONDON OR LISBON THE POSSIBILITY OF HIRING A HABITABLE HOUSE AT THEIR NEW POST AND WHEN THESE PROBLEMS WERE EXHAUSTED
3906-184005-0005 THE APPLICATION OF THE SAME METHOD TO THE SUBJECT OF OWEN'S FUTURE HIS GRANDMOTHER HAVING NO SUSPICION OF THE REAL REASON OF SOPHY VINER'S DEPARTURE HAD THOUGHT IT EXTREMELY SUITABLE OF THE YOUNG GIRL TO WITHDRAW TO THE SHELTER OF HER OLD FRIENDS ROOF IN THE HOUR OF BRIDAL PREPARATION
3906-184005-0006 THIS MAIDENLY RETREAT HAD IN FACT IMPRESSED MADAME DE CHANTELLE SO FAVOURABLY THAT SHE WAS DISPOSED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO TALK OVER OWEN'S PROJECTS AND AS EVERY HUMAN EVENT TRANSLATED ITSELF FOR HER INTO TERMS OF SOCIAL AND DOMESTIC DETAIL
3906-184005-0007 ANNA HAD PERFORCE TO TRAVEL THE SAME ROUND AGAIN SHE FELT A MOMENTARY RELIEF WHEN DARROW PRESENTLY JOINED THEM BUT HIS COMING SERVED ONLY TO DRAW THE CONVERSATION BACK TO THE QUESTION OF THEIR OWN FUTURE AND ANNA FELT A NEW PANG
3906-184005-0008 AS SHE HEARD HIM CALMLY AND LUCIDLY DISCUSSING IT DID SUCH SELF POSSESSION IMPLY INDIFFERENCE OR INSINCERITY IN THAT PROBLEM HER MIND PERPETUALLY REVOLVED AND SHE DREADED THE ONE ANSWER AS MUCH AS THE OTHER
3906-184005-0009 SHE WAS RESOLVED TO KEEP ON HER COURSE AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED TO MARRY DARROW AND NEVER LET THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PAST INTRUDE ITSELF BETWEEN THEM BUT SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT THE ONLY WAY OF ATTAINING TO THIS STATE OF DETACHMENT FROM THE IRREPARABLE
3906-184005-0010 WAS ONCE FOR ALL TO TURN BACK WITH HIM TO ITS CONTEMPLATION AS SOON AS THIS DESIRE HAD GERMINATED
3906-184005-0011 AND SOON AFTER LUNCHEON THE THREE SET FORTH IN THE MOTOR TO SHOW DARROW A CHATEAU FAMOUS IN THE ANNALS OF THE REGION DURING THEIR EXCURSION ANNA FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS FROM HIS DEMEANOUR IF EFFIE'S PRESENCE BETWEEN THEM WAS AS MUCH OF A STRAIN TO HIS COMPOSURE AS TO HERS
3906-184005-0012 HE REMAINED IMPERTURBABLY GOOD HUMOURED AND APPRECIATIVE WHILE THEY WENT THE ROUND OF THE MONUMENT AND SHE REMARKED ONLY THAT WHEN HE THOUGHT HIMSELF UNNOTICED HIS FACE GREW GRAVE AND HIS ANSWERS CAME LESS PROMPTLY
3906-184005-0013 DARROW ACQUIESCED AND THEY GOT OUT AND SENT EFFIE ON IN THE MOTOR THEIR WAY LED THROUGH A BIT OF SOBER FRENCH WOODLAND FLAT AS A FADED TAPESTRY BUT WITH GLEAMS OF LIVE EMERALD LINGERING HERE AND THERE AMONG ITS BROWNS AND OCHRES
3906-184005-0014 AND VEILED THE DISTANT GLIMPSES OF THE LANDSCAPE IN SOFT UNCERTAINTY IN SUCH A SOLITUDE ANNA HAD FANCIED IT WOULD BE EASIER TO SPEAK BUT AS SHE WALKED BESIDE DARROW OVER THE DEEP SOUNDLESS FLOORING OF BROWN MOSS THE WORDS ON HER LIPS TOOK FLIGHT AGAIN
3906-184005-0015 IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK THE SPELL OF QUIET JOY WHICH HIS PRESENCE LAID ON HER AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO TALK OF THE PLACE THEY HAD JUST VISITED SHE ANSWERED HIS QUESTIONS AND THEN WAITED FOR WHAT HE SHOULD SAY NEXT NO DECIDEDLY SHE COULD NOT SPEAK
3906-184005-0016 SHE NO LONGER EVEN KNEW WHAT SHE HAD MEANT TO SAY THE SAME EXPERIENCE REPEATED ITSELF SEVERAL TIMES THAT DAY AND THE NEXT
3906-184005-0017 SHE FORMULATED WITH A FERVENT LUCIDITY EVERY POINT IN HER IMAGINARY ARGUMENT BUT AS SOON AS SHE WAS ALONE WITH HIM SOMETHING DEEPER THAN REASON AND SUBTLER THAN SHYNESS LAID ITS BENUMBING TOUCH UPON HER AND THE DESIRE TO SPEAK BECAME MERELY A DIM DISQUIETUDE
3906-184005-0018 THROUGH WHICH HIS LOOKS HIS WORDS HIS TOUCH REACHED HER AS THROUGH A MIST OF BODILY PAIN YET THIS INERTIA WAS TORN BY WILD FLASHES OF RESISTANCE AND WHEN THEY WERE APART SHE BEGAN TO PREPARE AGAIN WHAT SHE MEANT TO SAY TO HIM
3906-184005-0019 SHE KNEW HE COULD NOT BE WITH HER WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF THIS INNER TURMOIL AND SHE HOPED HE WOULD BREAK THE SPELL BY SOME RELEASING WORD BUT SHE PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE RECOGNIZED THE FUTILITY OF WORDS
3906-184005-0020 AND WAS RESOLUTELY BENT ON HOLDING HER TO HER OWN PURPOSE OF BEHAVING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED ONCE MORE SHE INWARDLY ACCUSED HIM OF INSENSIBILITY AND HER IMAGINATION WAS BESET BY TORMENTING VISIONS OF HIS PAST HAD SUCH THINGS HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
3906-184005-0021 IF THE EPISODE HAD BEEN AN ISOLATED ACCIDENT
3906-184005-0022 FOR AT A CERTAIN POINT HER IMAGINATION ALWAYS TURNED BACK BUT IF IT WERE A MERE LINK IN A CHAIN OF SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS THE THOUGHT OF IT DISHONOURED HER WHOLE PAST EFFIE IN THE INTERREGNUM BETWEEN GOVERNESSES HAD BEEN GIVEN LEAVE TO DINE DOWNSTAIRS
3906-184005-0023 WHEN AT LENGTH SHE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF ANNA PROPOSED A GAME OF CARDS AND AFTER THIS DIVERSION HAD DRAWN TO ITS LANGUID CLOSE SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO DARROW AND FOLLOWED MADAME DE CHANTELLE UPSTAIRS BUT MADAME DE CHANTELLE NEVER SAT UP LATE
3906-184005-0024 AND THE SECOND EVENING WITH THE AMIABLY IMPLIED INTENTION OF LEAVING ANNA AND DARROW TO THEMSELVES SHE TOOK AN EARLIER LEAVE OF THEM THAN USUAL ANNA SAT SILENT LISTENING TO HER SMALL STIFF STEPS AS THEY MINCED DOWN THE HALL AND DIED OUT IN THE DISTANCE
3906-184005-0025 MADAME DE CHANTELLE HAD BROKEN HER WOODEN EMBROIDERY FRAME AND DARROW HAVING OFFERED TO REPAIR IT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR UP TO A TABLE THAT HELD A LAMP ANNA WATCHED HIM AS HE SAT WITH BENT HEAD AND KNITTED BROWS TRYING TO FIT TOGETHER THE DISJOINED PIECES
3906-184005-0026 THE SIGHT OF HIM SO TRANQUILLY ABSORBED IN THIS TRIFLING BUSINESS SEEMED TO GIVE TO THE QUIET ROOM A PERFUME OF INTIMACY TO FILL IT WITH A SENSE OF SWEET FAMILIAR HABIT AND IT CAME OVER HER AGAIN
3906-184005-0027 AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT OTHER WOMAN HAS SAT AND WATCHED HIM AS I AM DOING SHE HAS KNOWN HIM AS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN HIM PERHAPS HE IS THINKING OF THAT NOW
3906-184005-0028 HE LOOKED YOUNG ACTIVE STORED WITH STRENGTH AND ENERGY NOT THE MAN FOR VAIN REPININGS OR LONG MEMORIES SHE WONDERED WHAT SHE HAD TO HOLD OR SATISFY HIM HE LOVED HER NOW SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF THAT BUT HOW COULD SHE HOPE TO KEEP HIM
3906-184005-0029 THEY WERE SO NEARLY OF AN AGE THAT ALREADY SHE FELT HERSELF HIS SENIOR AS YET THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT VISIBLE OUTWARDLY AT LEAST THEY WERE MATCHED
3906-184005-0030 SHE THOUGHT WITH A PANG OF BITTERNESS HE WON'T GROW ANY OLDER BECAUSE HE DOESN'T FEEL THINGS AND BECAUSE HE DOESN'T I SHALL AND WHEN SHE CEASED TO PLEASE HIM WHAT THEN HAD HE THE TRADITION OF FAITH TO THE SPOKEN VOW
3906-184005-0031 BUT WHAT DID SHE CARE FOR HIS CONVICTIONS OR HIS THEORIES NO DOUBT HE LOVED HER NOW AND BELIEVED HE WOULD ALWAYS GO ON LOVING HER AND WAS PERSUADED THAT IF HE CEASED TO HIS LOYALTY WOULD BE PROOF AGAINST THE CHANGE WHAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW WAS NOT WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN ADVANCE
3906-184005-0032 BUT WHAT WOULD IMPEL OR RESTRAIN HIM AT THE CRUCIAL HOUR SHE PUT NO FAITH IN HER OWN ARTS SHE WAS TOO SURE OF HAVING NONE AND IF SOME BENEFICENT ENCHANTER HAD BESTOWED THEM ON HER SHE KNEW NOW THAT SHE WOULD HAVE REJECTED THE GIFT
3906-184005-0033 SHE COULD HARDLY CONCEIVE OF WANTING THE KIND OF LOVE THAT WAS A STATE ONE COULD BE COZENED INTO DARROW PUTTING AWAY THE FRAME WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AND SHE FELT HE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL TO SAY
3906-184005-0034 THEY'RE SURE TO SEND FOR ME IN A DAY OR TWO NOW HE BEGAN SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND HE CONTINUED YOU'LL TELL ME BEFORE I GO WHAT DAY I'M TO COME BACK AND GET YOU
3906-184005-0035 AND INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HIM SHE BROKE OUT THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WANTING YOU TO KNOW THE OTHER DAY IN PARIS I SAW MISS VINER SHE SAW HIM FLUSH WITH THE INTENSITY OF HIS SURPRISE YOU SENT FOR HER
3906-184005-0036 NO SHE HEARD FROM ADELAIDE THAT I WAS IN PARIS AND SHE CAME SHE CAME BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO URGE ME TO MARRY YOU
3906-184005-0037 DARROW STOOD UP I'M GLAD YOU'VE TOLD ME HE SPOKE WITH A VISIBLE EFFORT AT COMPOSURE HER EYES FOLLOWED HIM AS HE MOVED AWAY IS THAT ALL HE ASKED AFTER AN INTERVAL
3906-184005-0038 IT SEEMS TO ME A GREAT DEAL IT'S WHAT SHE'D ALREADY ASKED ME HIS VOICE SHOWED HER HOW DEEPLY HE WAS MOVED AND A THROB OF JEALOUSY SHOT THROUGH HER OH IT WAS FOR YOUR SAKE I KNOW HE MADE NO ANSWER AND SHE ADDED
3906-184005-0039 SHE'S BEEN EXCEEDINGLY GENEROUS WHY SHOULDN'T WE SPEAK OF IT SHE HAD LOWERED HER HEAD BUT THROUGH HER DROPPED LIDS SHE SEEMED TO BE WATCHING THE CROWDED SCENE OF HIS FACE I'VE NOT SHRUNK FROM SPEAKING OF IT SPEAKING OF HER THEN I MEAN
3906-184005-0040 SHE BROKE OFF CONFUSED AND HE QUESTIONED WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW BETTER THE COLOUR ROSE TO HER FOREHEAD HOW COULD SHE TELL HIM WHAT SHE SCARCELY DARED OWN TO HERSELF
3906-184005-0041 THERE WAS NOTHING SHE DID NOT WANT TO KNOW NO FOLD OR CRANNY OF HIS SECRET THAT HER AWAKENED IMAGINATION DID NOT STRAIN TO PENETRATE BUT SHE COULD NOT EXPOSE SOPHY VINER TO THE BASE FINGERINGS OF A RETROSPECTIVE JEALOUSY
3906-184005-0042 NOR DARROW TO THE TEMPTATION OF BELITTLING HER IN THE EFFORT TO BETTER HIS OWN CASE THE GIRL HAD BEEN MAGNIFICENT AND THE ONLY WORTHY RETURN THAT ANNA COULD MAKE WAS TO TAKE DARROW FROM HER WITHOUT A QUESTION IF SHE TOOK HIM AT ALL
3906-184005-0043 SHE LIFTED HER EYES TO HIS FACE I THINK I ONLY WANTED TO SPEAK HER NAME IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD SEEM SO AFRAID OF IT IF I WERE REALLY AFRAID OF IT I SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE YOU UP SHE SAID
