1018-133447-0000 INVARIABLY COME TO A HALT HOLDING THEIR BREATH IN A SUDDEN CATCH OF WONDER AS THEY PASS THROUGH THE HALF RUINOUS GATEWAY WHICH ADMITS TO THE CLOSE OF WRYCHESTER NOWHERE ELSE IN ENGLAND IS THERE A FAIRER PROSPECT OF OLD WORLD PEACE
1018-133447-0001 THERE BEFORE THEIR EYES SET IN THE CENTRE OF A GREAT GREEN SWARD FRINGED BY TALL ELMS AND GIANT BEECHES RISES THE VAST FABRIC OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY CATHEDRAL ITS HIGH SPIRE PIERCING THE SKIES
1018-133447-0002 IN WHICH ROOKS ARE FOR EVER CIRCLING AND CALLING THE TIME WORN STONE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE DELICATE AS LACEWORK IS TRANSFORMED AT DIFFERENT HOURS OF THE DAY INTO SHIFTING SHADES OF COLOUR VARYING FROM GREY TO PURPLE
1018-133447-0003 THE MASSIVENESS OF THE GREAT NAVE AND TRANSEPTS CONTRASTS IMPRESSIVELY WITH THE GRADUAL TAPERING OF THE SPIRE RISING SO HIGH ABOVE TURRET AND CLERESTORY THAT IT AT LAST BECOMES A MERE LINE AGAINST THE ETHER IN MORNING AS IN AFTERNOON
1018-133447-0004 OR IN EVENING HERE IS A PERPETUAL ATMOSPHERE OF REST AND NOT AROUND THE GREAT CHURCH ALONE BUT IN THE QUAINT AND ANCIENT HOUSES WHICH FENCE IN THE CLOSE LITTLE LESS OLD THAN THE MIGHTY MASS OF STONE ON WHICH THEIR IVY FRAMED WINDOWS LOOK
1018-133447-0005 AND THE ELM SHADOWED LAWN NOTHING ONE WOULD THINK COULD POSSIBLY EXIST BUT LEISURED AND PLEASANT EXISTENCE EVEN THE BUSY STREETS OF THE OLD CITY OUTSIDE THE CRUMBLING GATEWAY SEEM FOR THE MOMENT FAR OFF
1018-133447-0006 A LONG LOW CEILINGED ROOM WITH OAK PANELLING AROUND ITS WALLS AND OAK BEAMS ACROSS ITS ROOF A ROOM OF OLD FURNITURE AND OLD PICTURES AND OLD BOOKS ITS ANTIQUE ATMOSPHERE RELIEVED BY GREAT MASSES OF FLOWERS
1018-133447-0007 SET HERE AND THERE IN OLD CHINA BOWLS THROUGH ITS WIDE WINDOWS THE CASEMENTS OF WHICH WERE THROWN WIDE OPEN THERE WAS AN INVITING PROSPECT OF A HIGH EDGED FLOWER GARDEN AND SEEN IN VISTAS THROUGH THE TREES AND SHRUBBERIES
1018-133447-0008 BUT ON THE GARDEN AND INTO THIS FLOWER SCENTED ROOM THE SUN WAS SHINING GAILY THROUGH THE TREES AND MAKING GLEAMS OF LIGHT ON THE SILVER AND CHINA ON THE TABLE AND ON THE FACES OF THE THREE PEOPLE WHO SAT AROUND IT
1018-133447-0009 OF THESE THREE TWO WERE YOUNG AND THE THIRD WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHOSE AGE IT IS NEVER EASY TO GUESS A TALL CLEAN SHAVEN BRIGHT EYED ALERT LOOKING MAN GOOD LOOKING IN A CLEVER PROFESSIONAL SORT OF WAY
1018-133447-0010 A MAN WHOM NO ONE COULD HAVE TAKEN FOR ANYTHING BUT A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE LEARNED CALLINGS IN SOME LIGHTS HE LOOKED NO MORE THAN FORTY A STRONG LIGHT BETRAYED THE FACT THAT HIS DARK HAIR HAD A STREAK OF GREY IN IT AND WAS SHOWING A TENDENCY TO WHITEN ABOUT THE TEMPLES
1018-133447-0011 A STRONG INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR MAN THIS SCRUPULOUSLY GROOMED AND WELL DRESSED AS BEFITTED WHAT HE REALLY WAS A MEDICAL PRACTITIONER WITH AN EXCELLENT CONNECTION AMONGST THE EXCLUSIVE SOCIETY OF A CATHEDRAL TOWN
1018-133447-0012 AROUND HIM HUNG AN UNDENIABLE AIR OF CONTENT AND PROSPERITY AS HE TURNED OVER A PILE OF LETTERS WHICH STOOD BY HIS PLATE OR GLANCED AT THE MORNING NEWSPAPER WHICH LAY AT HIS ELBOW IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HE HAD NO CARES BEYOND THOSE OF THE DAY
1018-133447-0013 AND THAT THEY SO FAR AS HE KNEW THEN WERE NOT LIKELY TO AFFECT HIM GREATLY SEEING HIM IN THESE PLEASANT DOMESTIC CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE HEAD OF HIS TABLE WITH ABUNDANT EVIDENCES OF COMFORT AND REFINEMENT AND MODEST LUXURY ABOUT HIM
1018-133447-0014 ANY ONE WOULD HAVE SAID WITHOUT HESITATION THAT DOCTOR MARK RANSFORD WAS UNDENIABLY ONE OF THE FORTUNATE FOLK OF THIS WORLD THE SECOND PERSON OF THE THREE WAS A BOY OF APPARENTLY SEVENTEEN
1018-133447-0015 A WELL BUILT HANDSOME LAD OF THE SENIOR SCHOOLBOY TYPE WHO WAS DEVOTING HIMSELF IN BUSINESS LIKE FASHION TO TWO WIDELY DIFFERING PURSUITS ONE THE CONSUMPTION OF EGGS AND BACON AND DRY TOAST
1018-133447-0016 THE OTHER THE STUDY OF A LATIN TEXTBOOK WHICH HE HAD PROPPED UP IN FRONT OF HIM AGAINST THE OLD FASHIONED SILVER CRUET HIS QUICK EYES WANDERED ALTERNATELY BETWEEN HIS BOOK AND HIS PLATE NOW AND THEN HE MUTTERED A LINE OR TWO TO HIMSELF
1018-133447-0017 A GIRL OF NINETEEN OR TWENTY WAS THE BOY'S SISTER EACH HAD A WEALTH OF BROWN HAIR INCLINING IN THE GIRL'S CASE TO A SHADE THAT HAD TINTS OF GOLD IN IT EACH HAD GREY EYES IN WHICH THERE WAS A MIXTURE OF BLUE EACH HAD A BRIGHT VIVID COLOUR
1018-133447-0018 EACH WAS UNDENIABLY GOOD LOOKING AND EMINENTLY HEALTHY NO ONE WOULD HAVE DOUBTED THAT BOTH HAD LIVED A GOOD DEAL OF AN OPEN AIR EXISTENCE THE BOY WAS ALREADY MUSCULAR AND SINEWY
1018-133447-0019 THE GIRL LOOKED AS IF SHE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE TENNIS RACKET AND THE GOLF STICK NOR WOULD ANY ONE HAVE MADE THE MISTAKE OF THINKING THAT THESE TWO WERE BLOOD RELATIONS OF THE MAN AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE BETWEEN THEM AND HIM THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST RESEMBLANCE OF FEATURE
1018-133447-0020 WHILE THE BOY LEARNT THE LAST LINES OF HIS LATIN AND THE DOCTOR TURNED OVER THE NEWSPAPER THE GIRL READ A LETTER EVIDENTLY FROM THE LARGE SPRAWLING HANDWRITING THE MISSIVE OF SOME GIRLISH CORRESPONDENT
1018-133447-0021 SHE WAS DEEP IN IT WHEN FROM ONE OF THE TURRETS OF THE CATHEDRAL A BELL BEGAN TO RING AT THAT SHE GLANCED AT HER BROTHER THERE'S MARTIN DICK SHE SAID YOU'LL HAVE TO HURRY MANY A LONG YEAR BEFORE THAT
1018-133447-0022 THEY SHOULD CAUSE TO BE RUNG A BELL FROM ITS SMALLER BELL TOWER FOR THREE MINUTES BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK EVERY MORNING ALL THE YEAR ROUND
1018-133447-0023 BUT THIS BELL SERVED TO REMIND YOUNG GENTLEMEN GOING TO OFFICES AND BOYS GOING TO SCHOOL THAT THE HOUR OF THEIR SERVITUDE WAS NEAR AND DICK BEWERY WITHOUT A WORD BOLTED HALF HIS COFFEE SNATCHED UP HIS BOOK
1018-133447-0024 GRABBED AT A CAP WHICH LAY WITH MORE BOOKS ON A CHAIR CLOSE BY AND VANISHED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW THE DOCTOR LAUGHED LAID ASIDE HIS NEWSPAPER AND HANDED HIS CUP ACROSS THE TABLE I DON'T THINK YOU NEED BOTHER YOURSELF ABOUT DICK'S EVER BEING LATE MARY
1018-133447-0025 HE SAID YOU ARE NOT QUITE AWARE OF THE POWER OF LEGS THAT ARE ONLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD DICK COULD GET TO ANY GIVEN POINT IN JUST ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF THE TIME THAT I COULD FOR INSTANCE MOREOVER HE HAS A CUNNING KNOWLEDGE OF EVERY SHORT CUT IN THE CITY
1018-133447-0026 IT'S THE BEGINNING OF BAD HABITS OH WELL SAID RANSFORD INDULGENTLY HE'S PRETTY FREE FROM ANYTHING OF THAT SORT YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T EVEN SUSPECTED HIM OF SMOKING YET
1018-133447-0027 THAT'S BECAUSE HE THINKS SMOKING WOULD STOP HIS GROWTH AND INTERFERE WITH HIS CRICKET ANSWERED MARY HE WOULD SMOKE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT THAT'S GIVING HIM HIGH PRAISE THEN SAID RANSFORD YOU COULDN'T GIVE HIM HIGHER
1018-133447-0028 KNOW HOW TO REPRESS HIS INCLINATIONS AN EXCELLENT THING AND MOST UNUSUAL I FANCY MOST PEOPLE DON'T HE TOOK HIS REFILLED CUP ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND OPENED A BOX OF CIGARETTES WHICH STOOD ON THE MANTELPIECE
1018-133447-0029 AND THE GIRL INSTEAD OF PICKING UP HER LETTER AGAIN GLANCED AT HIM A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY THAT REMINDS ME OF OF SOMETHING I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU SHE SAID YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT ABOUT PEOPLE NOT REPRESSING THEIR INCLINATIONS I
1018-133447-0030 I WISH SOME PEOPLE WOULD RANSFORD TURNED QUICKLY FROM THE HEARTH AND GAVE HER A SHARP LOOK BENEATH WHICH HER COLOUR HEIGHTENED HER EYES SHIFTED THEIR GAZE AWAY TO HER LETTER AND SHE PICKED IT UP AND BEGAN TO FOLD IT NERVOUSLY
1018-133447-0031 PUTTING A QUICK SUGGESTION OF MEANING INQUIRY INTO HIS VOICE BRYCE HE ASKED THE GIRL NODDED HER FACE SHOWING DISTINCT ANNOYANCE AND DISLIKE BEFORE SAYING MORE RANSFORD LIGHTED A CIGARETTE
1018-133447-0032 BEEN AT IT AGAIN HE SAID AT LAST SINCE LAST TIME TWICE SHE ANSWERED I DIDN'T LIKE TO TELL YOU I'VE HATED TO BOTHER YOU ABOUT IT BUT WHAT AM I TO DO I DISLIKE HIM INTENSELY
1018-133447-0033 I CAN'T TELL WHY BUT IT'S THERE AND NOTHING COULD EVER ALTER THE FEELING AND THOUGH I TOLD HIM BEFORE THAT IT WAS USELESS HE MENTIONED IT AGAIN YESTERDAY AT MISSUS FOLLIOT'S GARDEN PARTY CONFOUND HIS IMPUDENCE GROWLED RANSFORD
1018-133447-0034 OH WELL I'LL HAVE TO SETTLE WITH HIM MYSELF IT'S USELESS TRIFLING WITH ANYTHING LIKE THAT I GAVE HIM A QUIET HINT BEFORE AND SINCE HE WON'T TAKE IT ALL RIGHT BUT WHAT SHALL YOU DO SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY NOT SEND HIM AWAY
1018-133447-0035 IF HE'S ANY DECENCY ABOUT HIM HE'LL GO AFTER WHAT I SAY TO HIM ANSWERED RANSFORD DON'T YOU TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT IT I'M NOT AT ALL KEEN ABOUT HIM HE'S A CLEVER ENOUGH FELLOW AND A GOOD ASSISTANT BUT I DON'T LIKE HIM PERSONALLY NEVER DID
1018-133447-0036 I DON'T WANT TO THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT I SAY SHOULD LOSE HIM HIS SITUATION OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT SHE REMARKED SLOWLY THAT WOULD SEEM NO NEED TO BOTHER INTERRUPTED RANSFORD HE'LL GET ANOTHER IN TWO MINUTES SO TO SPEAK
1018-133447-0037 AT LEAST SO I WAS ALWAYS GIVEN TO BELIEVE NOWADAYS YOU FORGET THAT MISTER PEMBERTON BRYCE IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD CALL A VERY PUSHING YOUNG MAN SAID MARY IF HE DOESN'T GET WHAT HE WANTS IN THIS WORLD IT WON'T BE FOR NOT ASKING FOR IT
1018-133447-0038 BUT IF YOU MUST SPEAK TO HIM AND I REALLY THINK YOU MUST WILL YOU TELL HIM THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO GET ME PERHAPS HE'LL TAKE IT FINALLY FROM YOU AS MY GUARDIAN
1018-133447-0039 BUT I WON'T HAVE HIM ANNOYING YOU AND I SUPPOSE IT HAS COME TO ANNOYANCE IT'S VERY ANNOYING TO BE ASKED THREE TIMES BY A MAN
1018-133447-0040 AT ANY TIME EVER SHE ANSWERED IT'S IRRITATING ALL RIGHT SAID RANSFORD QUIETLY I'LL SPEAK TO HIM THERE'S GOING TO BE NO ANNOYANCE FOR YOU UNDER THIS ROOF
1018-133447-0041 THE GIRL GAVE HIM A QUICK GLANCE AND RANSFORD TURNED AWAY FROM HER AND PICKED UP HIS LETTERS THANK YOU SHE SAID BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO TELL ME THAT BECAUSE I KNOW IT ALREADY NOW I WONDER IF YOU'LL TELL ME SOMETHING MORE
1018-133447-0042 RANSFORD TURNED BACK WITH A SUDDEN APPREHENSION WELL HE ASKED BRUSQUELY WHAT WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT DICK AND MYSELF SHE ASKED YOU PROMISED THAT YOU WOULD YOU KNOW SOME DAY
1018-133447-0043 AND A WHOLE YEAR'S GONE BY SINCE THEN AND DICK'S SEVENTEEN HE WON'T BE SATISFIED ALWAYS JUST TO KNOW NO MORE THAN THAT OUR FATHER AND MOTHER DIED WHEN WE WERE VERY LITTLE AND THAT YOU'VE BEEN GUARDIAN AND

1018-133447-0045 BUT WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT SHE PERSISTED IS THERE ANY REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T BE TOLD EVERYTHING SHE WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEMAND AND RANSFORD WHO HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT SOME MOMENT OF THIS SORT MUST INEVITABLY COME
1018-133447-0046 FELT THAT SHE WAS NOT GOING TO BE PUT OFF WITH ORDINARY EXCUSES HE HESITATED AND SHE WENT ON SPEAKING YOU KNOW SHE CONTINUED ALMOST PLEADINGLY WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL I NEVER HAVE KNOWN
