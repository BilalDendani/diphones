5671-50453-0000 BEING AS WAVERLEY WELL KNEW THE CONSTANT REPLY OF A HIGHLANDER
5671-50453-0001 GILFILLAN BUT NEITHER DID THIS PRODUCE ANY MARK OF RECOGNITION FROM HIS ESCORT THE TWILIGHT HAD GIVEN PLACE TO MOONSHINE WHEN THE PARTY HALTED UPON THE BRINK OF A PRECIPITOUS GLEN WHICH AS PARTLY ENLIGHTENED BY THE MOONBEAMS
5671-50453-0002 AND AS IT SEEMED BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK FOR WAVERLEY HEARD THE RUSHING OF A CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WATER ALTHOUGH ITS STREAM WAS INVISIBLE IN THE DARKNESS THE PARTY AGAIN STOPPED BEFORE A SMALL AND RUDELY CONSTRUCTED HOVEL THE DOOR WAS OPEN
5671-50453-0003 AND THE INSIDE OF THE PREMISES APPEARED AS UNCOMFORTABLE AND RUDE AS ITS SITUATION AND EXTERIOR FOREBODED THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF A FLOOR OF ANY KIND THE ROOF SEEMED RENT IN SEVERAL PLACES THE WALLS WERE COMPOSED OF LOOSE STONES AND TURF
5671-50453-0004 AND THE THATCH OF BRANCHES OF TREES THE FIRE WAS IN THE CENTRE AND FILLED THE WHOLE WIGWAM WITH SMOKE WHICH ESCAPED AS MUCH THROUGH THE DOOR AS BY MEANS OF A CIRCULAR APERTURE IN THE ROOF AN OLD HIGHLAND SIBYL THE ONLY INHABITANT OF THIS FORLORN MANSION
5671-50453-0005 THAT THEY SHOULD WEAR THE TARTAN STRIPED IN THE MODE PECULIAR TO THEIR RACE A MARK OF DISTINCTION ANCIENTLY GENERAL THROUGH THE HIGHLANDS AND STILL MAINTAINED BY THOSE CHIEFS WHO WERE PROUD OF THEIR LINEAGE OR JEALOUS OF THEIR SEPARATE AND EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY
5671-50453-0006 EDWARD HAD LIVED AT GLENNAQUOICH LONG ENOUGH TO BE AWARE OF A DISTINCTION WHICH HE HAD REPEATEDLY HEARD NOTICED AND NOW SATISFIED THAT HE HAD NO INTEREST WITH HIS ATTENDANTS HE GLANCED A DISCONSOLATE EYE AROUND THE INTERIOR OF THE CABIN
5671-50453-0007 THE ONLY FURNITURE EXCEPTING A WASHING TUB AND A WOODEN PRESS CALLED IN SCOTLAND AN AMBRY SORELY DECAYED WAS A LARGE WOODEN BED PLANKED AS IS USUAL ALL AROUND AND OPENING BY A SLIDING PANEL
5671-50453-0008 TO DISPEL THEM SHIVERING VIOLENT HEADACHE AND SHOOTING PAINS IN HIS LIMBS SUCCEEDED THESE SYMPTOMS AND IN THE MORNING IT WAS EVIDENT TO HIS HIGHLAND ATTENDANTS OR GUARD FOR HE KNEW NOT IN WHICH LIGHT TO CONSIDER THEM
5671-50453-0009 AFTER A LONG CONSULTATION AMONG THEMSELVES SIX OF THE PARTY LEFT THE HUT WITH THEIR ARMS LEAVING BEHIND AN OLD AND A YOUNG MAN THE FORMER ADDRESSED WAVERLEY AND BATHED THE CONTUSIONS WHICH SWELLING AND LIVID COLOUR NOW MADE CONSPICUOUS HIS OWN PORTMANTEAU
5671-50453-0010 WHICH THE HIGHLANDERS HAD NOT FAILED TO BRING OFF SUPPLIED HIM WITH LINEN AND TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE WAS WITH ALL ITS UNDIMINISHED CONTENTS FREELY RESIGNED TO HIS USE THE BEDDING OF HIS COUCH SEEMED CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE AND HIS AGED ATTENDANT CLOSED THE DOOR OF THE BED
5671-50453-0011 AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GAELIC FROM WHICH WAVERLEY GATHERED THAT HE EXHORTED HIM TO REPOSE SO BEHOLD OUR HERO FOR A SECOND TIME THE PATIENT OF A HIGHLAND ESCULAPIUS BUT IN A SITUATION MUCH MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN WHEN HE WAS THE GUEST OF THE WORTHY TOMANRAIT
5671-50453-0012 WHEN IT GAVE WAY TO THE CARE OF HIS ATTENDANTS AND THE STRENGTH OF HIS CONSTITUTION AND HE COULD NOW RAISE HIMSELF IN HIS BED THOUGH NOT WITHOUT PAIN HE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DISINCLINATION ON THE PART OF THE OLD WOMAN WHO ACTED AS HIS NURSE
5671-50453-0013 AS WELL AS ON THAT OF THE ELDERLY HIGHLANDER TO PERMIT THE DOOR OF THE BED TO BE LEFT OPEN SO THAT HE MIGHT AMUSE HIMSELF WITH OBSERVING THEIR MOTIONS AND AT LENGTH AFTER WAVERLEY HAD REPEATEDLY DRAWN OPEN AND THEY HAD AS FREQUENTLY SHUT THE HATCHWAY OF HIS CAGE
5671-50453-0014 THE OLD GENTLEMAN PUT AN END TO THE CONTEST BY SECURING IT ON THE OUTSIDE WITH A NAIL SO EFFECTUALLY THAT THE DOOR COULD NOT BE DRAWN TILL THIS EXTERIOR IMPEDIMENT WAS REMOVED WHILE MUSING UPON THE CAUSE OF THIS CONTRADICTORY SPIRIT IN PERSONS WHOSE CONDUCT
5671-50453-0015 INTIMATED NO PURPOSE OF PLUNDER AND WHO IN ALL OTHER POINTS APPEARED TO CONSULT HIS WELFARE AND HIS WISHES IT OCCURRED TO OUR HERO THAT DURING THE WORST CRISIS OF HIS ILLNESS A FEMALE FIGURE YOUNGER THAN HIS OLD HIGHLAND NURSE HAD APPEARED TO FLIT AROUND HIS COUCH
5671-50453-0016 AND WHY SHOULD SHE APPARENTLY DESIRE CONCEALMENT FANCY IMMEDIATELY AROUSED HERSELF AND TURNED TO FLORA MAC IVOR BUT AFTER A SHORT CONFLICT BETWEEN HIS EAGER DESIRE TO BELIEVE SHE WAS IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD GUARDING LIKE AN ANGEL OF MERCY THE COUCH OF HIS SICKNESS
5671-50453-0017 WAVERLEY WAS COMPELLED TO CONCLUDE THAT HIS CONJECTURE WAS ALTOGETHER IMPROBABLE SINCE TO SUPPOSE SHE HAD LEFT HER COMPARATIVELY SAFE SITUATION AT GLENNAQUOICH TO DESCEND INTO THE LOW COUNTRY NOW THE SEAT OF CIVIL WAR
5671-50453-0018 OF SOFTNESS AND DELICACY HOLD DIALOGUE WITH THE HOARSE INWARD CROAK OF OLD JANET FOR SO HE UNDERSTOOD HIS ANTIQUATED ATTENDANT WAS DENOMINATED HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO AMUSE HIS SOLITUDE
5671-50453-0019 HE EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN CONTRIVING SOME PLAN TO GRATIFY HIS CURIOSITY IN DESPITE OF THE SEDULOUS CAUTION OF JANET AND THE OLD HIGHLAND JANIZARY
5671-50453-0020 AT LENGTH UPON ACCURATE EXAMINATION THE INFIRM STATE OF HIS WOODEN PRISON HOUSE APPEARED TO SUPPLY THE MEANS OF GRATIFYING HIS CURIOSITY FOR OUT OF A SPOT WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT DECAYED HE WAS ABLE TO EXTRACT A NAIL THROUGH THIS MINUTE APERTURE HE COULD PERCEIVE A FEMALE FORM
5671-50453-0021 BUT SINCE THE DAYS OF OUR GRANDMOTHER EVE THE GRATIFICATION OF INORDINATE CURIOSITY
5671-50453-0022 NOR WAS THE FACE VISIBLE AND TO CROWN HIS VEXATION WHILE HE LABOURED WITH THE NAIL TO ENLARGE THE HOLE THAT HE MIGHT OBTAIN A MORE COMPLETE VIEW A SLIGHT NOISE BETRAYED HIS PURPOSE AND THE OBJECT OF HIS CURIOSITY INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED
5671-50453-0023 NOR SO FAR AS HE COULD OBSERVE DID SHE AGAIN REVISIT THE COTTAGE ALL PRECAUTIONS TO BLOCKADE HIS VIEW WERE FROM THAT TIME ABANDONED AND HE WAS NOT ONLY PERMITTED BUT ASSISTED TO RISE
5671-50453-0024 AND QUIT WHAT HAD BEEN IN A LITERAL SENSE HIS COUCH OF CONFINEMENT BUT HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE HUT FOR THE YOUNG HIGHLANDER HAD NOW REJOINED HIS SENIOR AND ONE OR OTHER WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE WATCH
5671-50453-0025 AND OPPOSED HIS EXIT ACCOMPANYING HIS ACTION WITH SIGNS WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THERE WAS DANGER IN THE ATTEMPT AND AN ENEMY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
5671-50453-0026 BETTER THAN HE COULD HAVE CONCEIVED FOR POULTRY AND EVEN WINE WERE NO STRANGERS TO HIS TABLE THE HIGHLANDERS NEVER PRESUMED TO EAT WITH HIM AND UNLESS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF WATCHING HIM TREATED HIM WITH GREAT RESPECT HIS SOLE AMUSEMENT WAS GAZING FROM THE WINDOW
5671-50453-0027 OR RATHER THE SHAPELESS APERTURE WHICH WAS MEANT TO ANSWER THE PURPOSE OF A WINDOW UPON A LARGE AND ROUGH BROOK WHICH RAGED AND FOAMED THROUGH A ROCKY CHANNEL CLOSELY CANOPIED WITH TREES AND BUSHES
5671-50453-0028 UPON THE SIXTH DAY OF HIS CONFINEMENT WAVERLEY FOUND HIMSELF SO WELL THAT HE BEGAN TO MEDITATE HIS ESCAPE FROM THIS DULL AND MISERABLE PRISON HOUSE THINKING ANY RISK WHICH HE MIGHT INCUR IN THE ATTEMPT PREFERABLE TO THE STUPEFYING AND INTOLERABLE UNIFORMITY OF JANET'S RETIREMENT
5671-50453-0029 THE QUESTION INDEED OCCURRED WHITHER HE WAS TO DIRECT HIS COURSE WHEN AGAIN AT HIS OWN DISPOSAL TWO SCHEMES SEEMED PRACTICABLE YET BOTH ATTENDED WITH DANGER AND DIFFICULTY ONE WAS TO GO BACK TO GLENNAQUOICH AND JOIN FERGUS MAC IVOR
5671-50453-0030 BY WHOM HE WAS SURE TO BE KINDLY RECEIVED AND IN THE PRESENT STATE OF HIS MIND THE RIGOUR WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED FULLY ABSOLVED HIM IN HIS OWN EYES FROM HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE EXISTING GOVERNMENT THE OTHER PROJECT WAS TO ENDEAVOUR TO ATTAIN A SCOTTISH SEAPORT
5671-50453-0031 AND THENCE TO TAKE SHIPPING FOR ENGLAND HIS MIND WAVERED BETWEEN THESE PLANS AND PROBABLY IF HE HAD EFFECTED HIS ESCAPE IN THE MANNER HE PROPOSED
5671-50453-0032 BUT HIS FORTUNE HAD SETTLED THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE LEFT TO HIS OPTION
5671-50453-0033 AND TWO HIGHLANDERS ENTERED WHOM WAVERLEY RECOGNISED AS HAVING BEEN A PART OF HIS ORIGINAL ESCORT TO THIS COTTAGE THEY CONVERSED FOR A SHORT TIME WITH THE OLD MAN AND HIS COMPANION AND THEN MADE WAVERLEY UNDERSTAND BY VERY SIGNIFICANT SIGNS THAT HE WAS TO PREPARE TO ACCOMPANY THEM
5671-50453-0034 THIS WAS A JOYFUL COMMUNICATION WHAT HAD ALREADY PASSED DURING HIS CONFINEMENT MADE IT EVIDENT THAT NO PERSONAL INJURY WAS DESIGNED TO HIM AND HIS ROMANTIC SPIRIT HAVING RECOVERED DURING HIS REPOSE MUCH OF THAT ELASTICITY WHICH ANXIETY RESENTMENT DISAPPOINTMENT
5671-50453-0035 WHICH MERELY GIVES DIGNITY TO THE FEELING OF THE INDIVIDUAL EXPOSED TO IT HAD SUNK UNDER THE EXTRAORDINARY AND APPARENTLY INSURMOUNTABLE EVILS BY WHICH HE APPEARED ENVIRONED AT CAIRNVRECKAN IN FACT THIS COMPOUND OF INTENSE CURIOSITY
5671-50453-0036 AND EXALTED IMAGINATION FORMS A PECULIAR SPECIES OF COURAGE WHICH SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES THE LIGHT USUALLY CARRIED BY A MINER SUFFICIENTLY COMPETENT INDEED TO AFFORD HIM GUIDANCE AND COMFORT DURING THE ORDINARY PERILS OF HIS LABOUR BUT CERTAIN TO BE EXTINGUISHED SHOULD HE ENCOUNTER
5671-50453-0037 THE MORE FORMIDABLE HAZARD OF EARTH DAMPS OR PESTIFEROUS VAPOURS IT WAS NOW HOWEVER ONCE MORE REKINDLED AND WITH A THROBBING MIXTURE OF HOPE AWE AND ANXIETY WAVERLEY WATCHED THE GROUP BEFORE HIM
5671-50453-0038 AS THOSE WHO WERE JUST ARRIVED SNATCHED A HASTY MEAL AND THE OTHERS ASSUMED THEIR ARMS AND MADE BRIEF PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR DEPARTURE AS HE SAT IN THE SMOKY HUT AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE FIRE AROUND WHICH THE OTHERS WERE CROWDED HE FELT A GENTLE PRESSURE UPON HIS ARM
5671-50453-0039 HE LOOKED ROUND IT WAS ALICE THE DAUGHTER OF DONALD BEAN LEAN SHE SHOWED HIM A PACKET OF PAPERS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE MOTION WAS REMARKED BY NO ONE ELSE
5671-50453-0040 AND PASSED ON AS IF TO ASSIST OLD JANET IN PACKING WAVERLEY'S CLOTHES IN HIS PORTMANTEAU IT WAS OBVIOUSLY HER WISH THAT HE SHOULD NOT SEEM TO RECOGNISE HER YET SHE REPEATEDLY LOOKED BACK AT HIM AS AN OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED OF DOING SO UNOBSERVED
5671-50453-0041 AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE REMARKED WHAT SHE DID SHE FOLDED THE PACKET WITH GREAT ADDRESS AND SPEED
5671-50453-0042 HERE THEN WAS FRESH FOOD FOR CONJECTURE WAS ALICE HIS UNKNOWN WARDEN AND WAS THIS MAIDEN OF THE CAVERN THE TUTELAR GENIUS THAT WATCHED HIS BED DURING HIS SICKNESS WAS HE IN THE HANDS OF HER FATHER AND IF SO WHAT WAS HIS PURPOSE
5671-50453-0043 SPOIL HIS USUAL OBJECT SEEMED IN THIS CASE NEGLECTED FOR NOT ONLY WAVERLEY'S PROPERTY WAS RESTORED BUT HIS PURSE WHICH MIGHT HAVE TEMPTED THIS PROFESSIONAL PLUNDERER HAD BEEN ALL ALONG SUFFERED TO REMAIN IN HIS POSSESSION ALL THIS PERHAPS THE PACKET MIGHT EXPLAIN
5671-50453-0044 BUT IT WAS PLAIN FROM ALICE'S MANNER THAT SHE DESIRED HE SHOULD CONSULT IT IN SECRET NOR DID SHE AGAIN SEEK HIS EYE AFTER SHE HAD SATISFIED HERSELF THAT HER MANOEUVRE WAS OBSERVED AND UNDERSTOOD
5671-50453-0045 AND IT WAS ONLY AS SHE TRIPT OUT FROM THE DOOR THAT FAVOURED BY THE OBSCURITY SHE GAVE WAVERLEY A PARTING SMILE AND NOD OF SIGNIFICANCE ERE SHE VANISHED IN THE DARK GLEN THE YOUNG HIGHLANDER WAS REPEATEDLY
5671-50453-0046 DESPATCHED BY HIS COMRADES AS IF TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE AT LENGTH WHEN HE HAD RETURNED FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THE WHOLE PARTY AROSE AND MADE SIGNS TO OUR HERO TO ACCOMPANY THEM BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE HOWEVER HE SHOOK HANDS WITH OLD JANET
5671-50453-0047 AND ADDED SUBSTANTIAL MARKS OF HIS GRATITUDE FOR HER ATTENDANCE
