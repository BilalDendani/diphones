6087-63229-0000 WARREN FREQUENTLY FELT THAT HIS TALK WITH HER WAS SOMETHING LIKE CONSULTATION WITH A SPECIALLY CLEVER AND SYMPATHETIC PROFESSIONAL CONFRERE HER SUGGESTIONS OR CONCLUSIONS WERE INVARIABLY WORTH CONSIDERATION MORE THAN ONCE HIS REFLECTION UPON THEM HAD LED HIM TO EXCELLENT RESULTS
6087-63229-0001 SHE MADE ONE NIGHT A SUGGESTION WITH REGARD TO THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE WHICH STRUCK HIM AS BEING MORE THAN USUALLY ASTUTE IS SHE AN INTELLECTUAL WOMAN SHE INQUIRED NOT IN THE LEAST
6087-63229-0002 AN UNSPARINGLY BRILLIANT PERSON MIGHT FEEL HIMSELF ENTITLED TO THE RIGHT TO CALL HER STUPID IS SHE TALKATIVE FAR FROM IT ONE OF HER CHARMS IS THE NICE RESPECT SHE SEEMS TO FEEL FOR THE REMARKS OF OTHERS AND SHE IS NOT EXCITABLE
6087-63229-0003 RATHER THE REVERSE IF EXCITABILITY IS LIVELINESS SHE IS DULL I SEE SLOWLY YOU HAVE NOT YET THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE MIGHT WELL BE UNDER SOME DELUSION WARREN TURNED QUICKLY AND LOOKED AT HER
6087-63229-0004 IT IS WONDERFULLY BRILLIANT OF YOU TO HAVE THOUGHT OF IT A DELUSION HE STOOD AND THOUGHT IT OVER DO YOU REMEMBER HIS WIFE ASSISTED HIM WITH THE COMPLICATIONS WHICH AROSE FROM YOUNG MISSUS JERROLD'S RUNNING AWAY UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
6087-63229-0005 TO SCOTLAND AND HIDING HERSELF IN A SHEPHERD'S COTTAGE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HER HUSBAND WAS SHADOWING HER WITH DETECTIVES YOU RECOLLECT WHAT A LOVABLE WOMAN SHE WAS AND WHAT HORROR SHE FELT OF THE POOR FELLOW YES YES THAT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE TOO
6087-63229-0006 MISSUS WARREN WARMED WITH HER SUBJECT HERE IS A WOMAN OBVIOUSLY CONCEALING HERSELF FROM THE WORLD IN A LODGING HOUSE PLAINLY POSSESSING MONEY OWNING A HUGE RUBY RING RECEIVING DOCUMENTS STAMPED WITH IMPOSING SEALS
6087-63229-0007 TAKING EXERCISE ONLY BY NIGHT HEART WRUNG OVER THE NON ARRIVAL OF LETTERS WHICH ARE DUE EVERY DETAIL POINTS TO ONE PAINFUL DUBIOUS SITUATION ON THE OTHER HAND SHE PRESENTS TO YOU THE MANNER AND ASPECT OF A WOMAN WHO IS ABSOLUTELY NOT DUBIOUS
6087-63229-0008 AND WHO IS MERELY ANXIOUS ON THE ONE POINT A DUBIOUS PERSON WOULD BE INDIFFERENT TO ISN'T IT THEN POSSIBLE THAT OVER WROUGHT PHYSICAL CONDITION MAY HAVE DRIVEN HER TO THE BELIEF THAT SHE IS HIDING FROM DANGER DOCTOR WARREN WAS EVIDENTLY FOLLOWING THE THOUGHT SERIOUSLY
6087-63229-0009 SHE SAID REFLECTING THAT ALL THAT MATTERED WAS THAT SHE SHOULD BE SAFE
6087-63229-0010 BUT AS THE RESULT OF ANOTHER MEMORY HOW SANE SHE SEEMS HE WAS THINKING OF THIS POSSIBLE ASPECT OF THE MATTER AS HE MOUNTED THE STAIRCASE OF THE HOUSE IN MORTIMER STREET THE NEXT DAY THE STAIRWAY WAS OF THE ORDINARY LODGING HOUSE TYPE
6087-63229-0011 ITS DINGINESS SOMEWHAT ALLEVIATED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUPPS HAD COVERED THE WORN CARPET WITH CLEAN WARM COLOURED FELTING THE YELLOWISH MARBLED PAPER ON THE WALLS DEPRESSED THE MIND AS ONE PASSED IT THE INDETERMINATE DUN PAINT HAD DEFIED FOG FOR YEARS
6087-63229-0012 THE WHOLE HOUSE PRESENTED ONLY SUCH FEATURES AS WOULD ENCOURAGE ITS PROPRIETORS TO TRUST TO THE SUFFICING OF INFREQUENT RE DECORATION
6087-63229-0013 SHE HAD INTRODUCED PALLIATIONS BY DEGREES AND WITH AN UNOBTRUSIVENESS WHICH WAS NOT LIKELY TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF NEIGHBOURS UNACCUSTOMED TO LAVISH DELIVERY BY MEANS OF FURNITURE VANS SHE HAD BROUGHT IN A RUG OR SO
6087-63229-0014 AND HAD GRADUALLY REPLACED OBJECTS WITH SUCH AS WERE MORE PLEASANT TO LIVE WITH AND MORE COMFORTABLE TO USE DOCTOR WARREN HAD SEEN THE CHANGE WROUGHT AND HAD NOTED EVIDENCES THAT MONEY WAS NOT UNOBTAINABLE
6087-63229-0015 THE MAID ALSO WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE MANNER TOWARDS HER MISTRESS WAS NOT MERELY RESPECTFUL AND WELL BRED BUT SUGGESTIVE OF WATCHFUL AFFECTION BORDERING ON REVERENCE JANE CUPP HERSELF WAS A CERTIFICATE OF DECORUM AND GOOD STANDING
6087-63229-0016 IT WAS NOT SUCH YOUNG WOMEN WHO SECLUDED THEMSELVES WITH QUESTIONABLE SITUATIONS
6087-63229-0017 AS SHE LAID HER HAND ON THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR TO OPEN IT AND ANNOUNCE HIM IT OCCURRED TO DOCTOR WARREN THAT HE WOULD TELL MARY THAT EVENING THAT IF MISSUS JAMESON HAD BEEN THE HEROINE OF ANY UNCONVENTIONAL DOMESTIC DRAMA IT WAS AN UNMISTAKABLE FACT THAT JANE CUPP WOULD HAVE
6087-63229-0018 QUITE SIX MONTHS AGO AND THERE SHE WAS IN A NEAT GOWN AND APRON EVIDENTLY A FIXTURE BECAUSE SHE LIKED HER PLACE HER DECENT YOUNG FACE FULL OF SYMPATHETIC INTEREST THE DAY WAS DULL AND COLD BUT THE FRONT ROOM WAS WARM AND MADE CHEERFUL BY FIRE
6087-63229-0019 MISSUS JAMESON WAS SITTING AT A WRITING TABLE THERE WERE LETTERS BEFORE HER AND SHE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN RE READING THEM SHE DID NOT ANY LONGER BLOOM WITH NORMAL HEALTH HER FACE WAS A LITTLE DRAGGED AND THE FIRST THING HE NOTED IN THE EYES SHE LIFTED TO HIM WAS THAT THEY WERE BEWILDERED
6087-63229-0020 SHE HAS HAD A SHOCK HE THOUGHT POOR WOMAN HE BEGAN TO TALK TO HER ABOUT HERSELF WITH THE KINDLY PERCEPTION WHICH WAS INSEPARABLE FROM HIM HE WONDERED IF THE TIME HAD NOT COME WHEN SHE WOULD CONFIDE IN HIM
6087-63229-0021 HER SHOCK WHATSOEVER IT HAD BEEN HAD LEFT HER IN THE POSITION OF A WOMAN WHOLLY AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND WHAT HAD OCCURRED HE SAW THIS IN HER INGENUOUS TROUBLED FACE HE FELT AS IF SHE WAS ASKING HERSELF WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6087-63229-0022 IT WAS NOT UNLIKELY THAT PRESENTLY SHE WOULD ASK HIM WHAT SHE SHOULD DO HE HAD BEEN ASKED SUCH THINGS BEFORE BY WOMEN BUT THEY USUALLY ADDED TRYING DETAIL ACCOMPANIED BY SOBS AND APPEALED TO HIS CHIVALRY FOR IMPOSSIBLE AID
6087-63229-0023 SOMETIMES THEY IMPLORED HIM TO GO TO PEOPLE AND USE HIS INFLUENCE EMILY ANSWERED ALL HIS QUESTIONS WITH HER USUAL SWEET GOOD SENSE SHE WAS NOT WELL YESTERDAY SHE HAD FAINTED WAS THERE ANY DISTURBING REASON FOR THE FAINT HE INQUIRED
6087-63229-0024 IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED SHE ANSWERED HESITATING I HAD A LETTER WHICH IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED SHE WAS THINKING DESPERATELY SHE COULD UNDERSTAND NOTHING
6087-63229-0025 IT WAS NOT EXPLAINABLE THAT WHAT SHE HAD WRITTEN DID NOT MATTER AT ALL THAT JAMES SHOULD HAVE MADE NO REPLY I WAS AWAKE ALL NIGHT SHE ADDED THAT MUST NOT GO ON HE SAID I WAS THINKING AND THINKING NERVOUSLY
6087-63229-0026 I CAN SEE THAT WAS HIS ANSWER PERHAPS SHE OUGHT TO HAVE COURAGE TO SAY NOTHING IT MIGHT BE SAFER BUT IT WAS SO LONELY NOT TO DARE TO ASK ANYONE'S ADVICE THAT SHE WAS GETTING FRIGHTENED INDIA WAS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
6087-63229-0027 AND LETTERS TOOK SO LONG TO COME AND GO ANXIETY MIGHT MAKE HER ILL BEFORE SHE COULD RECEIVE A REPLY TO A SECOND LETTER AND PERHAPS NOW IN HER TERROR SHE HAD PUT HERSELF INTO A RIDICULOUS POSITION HOW COULD SHE SEND FOR LADY MARIA TO MORTIMER STREET AND EXPLAIN TO HER
6087-63229-0028 SHE REALISED ALSO THAT HER LADYSHIP'S SENSE OF HUMOUR MIGHT NOT BE A THING TO CONFIDE IN SAFELY WARREN'S STRONG AMIABLE PERSONALITY WAS GOOD FOR HER IT SERVED TO AID HER TO NORMAL REASONING THOUGH SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE FACT HER FEARS
6087-63229-0029 HER SIMPLICITY AND HER TIMOROUS ADORATION OF HER HUSBAND HAD NOT ALLOWED HER TO REASON NORMALLY IN THE PAST SHE HAD BEEN TOO ANXIOUS AND TOO MUCH AFRAID HER VISITOR WATCHED HER WITH GREAT INTEREST AND NO LITTLE CURIOSITY
6087-63229-0030 HE HIMSELF SAW THAT HER MOOD WAS NOT NORMAL SHE DID NOT LOOK AS POOR MISSUS JERROLD HAD LOOKED BUT SHE WAS NOT IN A NORMAL STATE HE MADE HIS VISIT A LONG ONE PURPOSELY TEA WAS BROUGHT UP AND HE DRANK IT WITH HER HE WANTED TO GIVE HER TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND ABOUT HIM
6087-63229-0031 WHEN AT LAST HE ROSE TO GO AWAY SHE ROSE ALSO SHE LOOKED NERVOUSLY UNDECIDED BUT LET HIM GO TOWARDS THE DOOR HER MOVE FORWARD WAS CURIOUSLY SUDDEN NO NO SHE SAID PLEASE COME BACK I OH I REALLY THINK I OUGHT TO TELL YOU
6087-63229-0032 HE TURNED TOWARDS HER WISHING THAT MARY WERE WITH HIM SHE STOOD TRYING TO SMILE AND LOOKING SO ENTIRELY NICE AND WELL BEHAVED EVEN IN HER AGITATION IF I WERE NOT SO PUZZLED OR IF THERE WAS ANYBODY SHE SAID
6087-63229-0033 IF YOU COULD ONLY ADVISE ME I MUST I MUST KEEP SAFE
6087-63229-0034 HE SAID QUIETLY YES SHE ANSWERED I AM SO ANXIOUS AND I AM SURE IT MUST BE BAD FOR ONE TO BE ANXIOUS ALWAYS
6087-63229-0035 MY NAME IS NOT MISSUS JAMESON DOCTOR WARREN I AM I AM LADY WALDERHURST HE BARELY MANAGED TO RESTRAIN A START
6087-63229-0036 BUT MARY HAD BEEN RIGHT EMILY BLUSHED TO HER EARS WITH EMBARRASSMENT HE DID NOT BELIEVE HER BUT I AM REALLY SHE PROTESTED I REALLY AM I WAS MARRIED LAST YEAR I WAS EMILY FOX SETON PERHAPS YOU REMEMBER
6087-63229-0037 SHE WAS NOT FLIGHTY OR INDIGNANT HER FRANK FACE WAS ONLY A LITTLE MORE TROUBLED THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES WITHOUT A DOUBT OF HIS PRESENTLY BELIEVING HER GOOD HEAVENS IF
6087-63229-0038 SHE WALKED TO THE WRITING TABLE AND PICKED UP A NUMBER OF LETTERS THEY WERE ALL STAMPED WITH THE SAME SEAL SHE BROUGHT THEM TO HIM ALMOST COMPOSEDLY I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED HOW STRANGE IT WOULD SOUND SHE SAID IN HER AMENABLE VOICE
6087-63229-0039 I HOPE I AM NOT DOING WRONG IN SPEAKING I HOPE YOU WON'T MIND MY TROUBLING YOU IT SEEMED AS IF I COULDN'T BEAR IT ALONE ANY LONGER AFTER WHICH SHE TOLD HIM HER STORY THE UNADORNED STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS OF THE RELATION MADE IT AN AMAZING THING TO HEAR
6087-63229-0040 EVEN MORE AMAZING THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY A MORE IMAGINATIVE HANDLING HER OBVIOUS INABILITY TO COPE WITH THE UNUSUAL AND VILLAINOUS COMBINED WITH HER ENTIRE WILLINGNESS TO OBLITERATE HERSELF IN ANY MANNER IN HER WHOLE SOULED TENDERNESS
6087-63229-0041 FOR THE ONE PRESENT OBJECT OF HER EXISTENCE WERE THINGS A MAN COULD NOT BE UNMOVED BY EVEN THOUGH EXPERIENCE LED HIM TO SMILE AT THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD WHICH HAD LEFT HER WITHOUT PRACTICAL DEFENCE HER VERY HUMBLENESS AND CANDOUR MADE HER A DRAMA IN HERSELF
6087-63229-0042 PERHAPS I WAS WRONG TO RUN AWAY PERHAPS ONLY A SILLY WOMAN WOULD HAVE DONE SUCH A QUEER UNCONVENTIONAL THING BUT I COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE SO LIKELY TO BE QUITE SAFE UNTIL LORD WALDERHURST COULD ADVISE ME AND WHEN HIS LETTER CAME YESTERDAY
6087-63229-0043 AND HE DID NOT SPEAK OF WHAT I HAD SAID HER VOICE QUITE FAILED HER CAPTAIN OSBORN HAS DETAINED YOUR LETTER LORD WALDERHURST HAS NOT SEEN IT LIFE BEGAN TO COME BACK TO HER SHE HAD BEEN SO HORRIBLY BEWILDERED AS TO THINK AT MOMENTS
6087-63229-0044 THE INFORMATION YOU SENT HIM IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MOVING A MAN IN HIS POSITION COULD RECEIVE DO YOU THINK SO REALLY SHE LIFTED HER HEAD WITH NEW COURAGE AND HER COLOUR RETURNED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT SHOULD BE OTHERWISE
6087-63229-0045 IT IS I ASSURE YOU IMPOSSIBLE LADY WALDERHURST
