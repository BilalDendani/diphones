4071-39913-0000 THE OLD CHEST AT WYTHER GRANGE WHEN I WAS A CHILD I ALWAYS THOUGHT A VISIT TO WYTHER GRANGE WAS A GREAT TREAT
4071-39913-0001 SHE ALWAYS WORE STIFFLY RUSTLING GOWNS OF RICH SILK MADE IN THE FASHION OF HER YOUTH I SUPPOSE SHE MUST HAVE CHANGED HER DRESS OCCASIONALLY
4071-39913-0002 AS SHE WENT TRAILING ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH A BIG BUNCH OF KEYS AT HER BELT KEYS THAT OPENED A SCORE OF WONDERFUL OLD CHESTS AND BOXES AND DRAWERS IT WAS ONE OF MY
4071-39913-0003 AS WINNIFRED LAURANCE SHE HAD BEEN THE BEAUTY OF THE FAMILY AND WAS A HANDSOME WOMAN STILL WITH BRILLIANT DARK EYES AND CAMEO LIKE FEATURES SHE ALWAYS LOOKED VERY SAD SPOKE IN A LOW SWEET VOICE
4071-39913-0004 AND WAS MY CHILDISH IDEAL OF ALL THAT WAS HIGH BRED AND GRACEFUL I HAD MANY BELOVED HAUNTS AT THE GRANGE BUT I LIKED THE GARRET BEST IT WAS A ROOMY OLD PLACE BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE COMFORTABLY HOUSED A FAMILY IN ITSELF
4071-39913-0005 THAT OLD GARRET WAS A VERITABLE FAIRYLAND TO ME THERE WAS ONE OLD CHEST WHICH I COULD NOT EXPLORE AND LIKE ALL FORBIDDEN THINGS IT POSSESSED A GREAT ATTRACTION FOR ME IT STOOD AWAY BACK IN A DUSTY COBWEBBED CORNER
4071-39913-0006 A STRONG HIGH WOODEN BOX PAINTED BLUE FROM SOME WORDS WHICH I HAD HEARD GRANDMOTHER LET FALL I WAS SURE IT HAD A HISTORY IT WAS THE ONE THING SHE NEVER EXPLORED IN HER PERIODICAL OVERHAULINGS
4071-39913-0007 WHEN I GREW TIRED OF PLAYING I LIKED TO CREEP UP ON IT AND SIT THERE PICTURING OUT MY OWN FANCIES CONCERNING IT OF WHICH MY FAVOURITE ONE WAS THAT SOME DAY I SHOULD SOLVE THE RIDDLE AND OPEN THE CHEST TO FIND IT FULL OF GOLD AND JEWELS
4071-39913-0008 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE OLD CHEST GRANDMOTHER RAPPED THE TOP SMARTLY WITH HER KEYS I WONDER WHAT IS IN THIS OLD CHEST SHE SAID I BELIEVE IT REALLY SHOULD BE OPENED THE MOTHS MAY HAVE GOT INTO IT THROUGH THAT CRACK IN THE LID
4071-39913-0009 SHE CONFIDED IT TO MY CARE WHEN SHE WENT AWAY AND I PROMISED THAT IT SHOULD NEVER BE OPENED UNTIL SHE CAME FOR IT
4071-39913-0010 IT IS ALMOST THIRTY YEARS SINCE SHE WAS HERE HOW PRETTY SHE WAS I NEVER APPROVED OF HER SAID GRANDMOTHER BRUSQUELY SHE WAS A SENTIMENTAL FANCIFUL CREATURE
4071-39913-0011 I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE WILL REFUSE SHE WILL CLING TO HER OLD SENTIMENTAL IDEAS AS LONG AS THE BREATH IS IN HER BODY I RATHER AVOIDED THE OLD CHEST AFTER THIS IT TOOK ON A NEW SIGNIFICANCE IN MY EYES AND SEEMED TO ME LIKE THE TOMB OF SOMETHING
4071-39913-0012 THAT IS FROM ELIZA SHE SAID I WOULD KNOW HER WRITING ANYWHERE NONE OF YOUR MODERN SPRAWLY UNTIDY HANDS BUT A FINE LADY LIKE SCRIPT AS REGULAR AS COPPERPLATE READ THE LETTER WINNIFRED
4071-39913-0013 YOU NEED NOT READ THEM ALOUD I CAN IMAGINE THEM ALL
4071-39913-0014 AUNT WINNIFRED OPENED AND READ THE LETTER AND LAID IT DOWN WITH A BRIEF SIGH THIS IS ALL SHE SAYS ABOUT THE CHEST IF IT WERE NOT FOR ONE THING THAT IS IN IT I WOULD ASK YOU TO OPEN THE CHEST AND BURN ALL ITS CONTENTS
4071-39913-0015 BUT I CANNOT BEAR THAT ANYONE BUT MYSELF SHOULD SEE OR TOUCH THAT ONE THING SO PLEASE LEAVE THE CHEST AS IT IS DEAR AUNT IT IS NO MATTER IF THE MOTHS DO GET IN THAT IS ALL
4071-39913-0016 AND I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM DISAPPOINTED I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN ALMOST CHILDISH CURIOSITY ABOUT THAT OLD CHEST BUT I SEEM FATED NOT TO HAVE IT GRATIFIED THAT ONE THING MUST BE HER WEDDING DRESS
4071-39913-0017 AND AFTERWARDS I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY WE WENT EAGERLY UP THE GARRET STAIRS AUNT KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE OLD CHEST AND SELECTED A KEY FROM THE BUNCH AT HER BELT WOULD IT NOT BE TOO PROVOKING AMY IF THIS KEY SHOULD NOT FIT AFTER ALL WELL I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD BE ANY MORE DISAPPOINTED THAN I
4071-39913-0018 A LAYER OF TISSUE PAPER REVEALED ITSELF WITH A FINE TRACING OF SIFTED DUST IN ITS CRINKLES LIFT IT UP CHILD SAID MY AUNT GENTLY THERE ARE NO GHOSTS FOR YOU AT LEAST IN THIS OLD CHEST
4071-39913-0019 LIFTING UP THE COVER SHE LAID IT IN MY LAP THERE AMY
4071-39913-0020 THE FIRST THING I TOOK OUT WAS A SMALL SQUARE CASE COVERED WITH DARK PURPLE VELVET THE TINY CLASP WAS ALMOST RUSTED AWAY AND YIELDED EASILY I GAVE A LITTLE CRY OF ADMIRATION AUNT WINNIFRED BENT OVER MY SHOULDER THAT IS ELIZA'S PORTRAIT AT THE AGE OF TWENTY
4071-39913-0021 LOVELY INDEED WAS THE FACE LOOKING OUT AT ME FROM ITS BORDER OF TARNISHED GILT
4071-39913-0022 WAS A WARM AUBURN AND THE CURVES OF HER BARE NECK AND SHOULDERS WERE EXQUISITE THE OTHER PICTURE IS THAT OF THE MAN TO WHOM SHE WAS BETROTHED TELL ME AMY DO YOU THINK HIM HANDSOME I LOOKED AT THE OTHER PORTRAIT CRITICALLY IT WAS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE
4071-39913-0023 HE WAS UNDENIABLY HANDSOME BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING I DID NOT LIKE IN HIS FACE AND I SAID SO AUNT WINNIFRED MADE NO REPLY SHE WAS TAKING OUT THE REMAINING CONTENTS OF THE BOX THERE WAS A WHITE SILK FAN WITH DELICATELY CARVED IVORY STICKS
4071-39913-0024 AUNT LAID THE BOX ASIDE AND UNPACKED THE CHEST IN SILENCE FIRST CAME A BALL DRESS OF PALE YELLOW SATIN BROCADE MADE WITH THE TRAINED SKIRT BABY WAIST AND FULL PUFFED SLEEVES OF A FORMER GENERATION
4071-39913-0025 WHERE SHALL I BEGIN AT THE VERY BEGINNING AUNTY YOU SEE I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL EXCEPT HER NAME TELL ME WHO SHE WAS AND WHY SHE PUT HER WEDDING DRESS AWAY HERE POOR ELIZA SAID AUNT DREAMILY
4071-39913-0026 HER HOME WAS IN A DISTANT CITY AND SHE NEVER CAME TO WYTHER GRANGE THE OTHER ELIZA LAURANCE WAS A POOR MAN'S DAUGHTER SHE AND I WERE OF THE SAME AGE AND DID NOT LOOK UNLIKE EACH OTHER ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT SO PRETTY BY HALF YOU CAN SEE BY THE PORTRAIT HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS
4071-39913-0027 THIS DID NOT SEEM MUCH OF A DEFECT TO ME THEN AMY FOR I WAS YOUNG AND ROMANTIC TOO MOTHER NEVER CARED MUCH FOR ELIZA I THINK BUT EVERYONE ELSE LIKED HER
4071-39913-0028 THE GRANGE WAS A VERY LIVELY PLACE THEN AMY
4071-39913-0029 HIS MANNERS WERE POLISHED AND EASY AND PEOPLE SAID HE WAS RICH I DON'T THINK AMY THAT I EVER TRUSTED WILLIS STARR BUT LIKE ALL THE REST I WAS BLINDED BY HIS CHARM MOTHER WAS ALMOST THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT WORSHIP AT HIS SHRINE
4071-39913-0030 AND WE WERE INVITED TO A BALL THAT EVENING THIS YELLOW GOWN IS THE VERY ONE SHE WORE I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY SHE PUT IT AWAY HERE THE GOWN SHE WORE ON THE HAPPIEST NIGHT OF HER LIFE I HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK MORE BEAUTIFUL
4071-39913-0031 HER NECK AND ARMS WERE BARE AND SHE WORE THIS STRING OF PEARLS AND CARRIED A BOUQUET OF HER FAVOURITE WHITE ROSES WHEN WE REACHED HOME AFTER THE DANCE ELIZA HAD HER HAPPY SECRET TO TELL US SHE WAS ENGAGED TO WILLIS STARR AND THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED IN EARLY SPRING
4071-39913-0032 WILLIS STARR CERTAINLY SEEMED TO BE AN IDEAL LOVER AND ELIZA WAS SO PERFECTLY HAPPY THAT SHE SEEMED TO GROW MORE BEAUTIFUL AND RADIANT EVERY DAY WELL AMY THE WEDDING DAY WAS SET
4071-39913-0033 AS HER OWN MOTHER WAS DEAD AND I WAS TO BE BRIDESMAID WE MADE HER WEDDING DRESS TOGETHER SHE AND I GIRLS WERE NOT ABOVE MAKING THEIR OWN GOWNS THEN
4071-39913-0034 IT WAS I WHO DRAPED THE VEIL OVER HER SUNNY CURLS SEE HOW YELLOW AND CREASED IT IS NOW BUT IT WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW THAT DAY A WEEK BEFORE THE WEDDING WILLIS STARR WAS SPENDING THE EVENING AT THE GRANGE WE WERE ALL CHATTERING GAILY ABOUT THE COMING EVENT
4071-39913-0035 CERTAINLY THERE IS I SAID SHARPLY SHE IS OUR COUSIN AND THE DAUGHTER OF OUR UNCLE GEORGE OUR ELIZA IS NOT AN HEIRESS YOU SURELY DID NOT SUPPOSE SHE WAS WILLIS STEPPED ASIDE WITH A MOCKING SMILE
4071-39913-0036 I DID WHAT WONDER I HAD HEARD MUCH ABOUT THE GREAT HEIRESS ELIZA LAURANCE AND THE GREAT BEAUTY ELIZA LAURANCE I SUPPOSED THEY WERE ONE AND THE SAME YOU HAVE ALL BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO UNDECEIVE ME
4071-39913-0037 WE HAVE NEVER DREAMED OF ALLOWING ANYONE TO THINK THAT ELIZA WAS AN HEIRESS SHE IS SWEET AND LOVELY ENOUGH TO BE LOVED FOR HER OWN SAKE I WENT BACK TO THE PARLOUR FULL OF DISMAY WILLIS STARR REMAINED GLOOMY AND TACITURN ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO NOTICE IT BUT MYSELF
4071-39913-0038 I LAUGHED AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS LEAVING HER TO READ IT WHEN I RETURNED SHE WAS STILL STANDING JUST WHERE I HAD LEFT HER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM HOLDING THE LETTER IN HER HAND HER FACE WAS AS WHITE AS HER VEIL
4071-39913-0039 AS OF SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN STRICKEN A MORTAL BLOW
4071-39913-0040 IT WAS THE FORTUNE NOT THE GIRL HE LOVED HE SAYS HE IS TOO POOR FOR US TO DREAM OF MARRYING WHEN I HAVE NOTHING OH SUCH A CRUEL HEARTLESS LETTER WHY DID HE NOT KILL ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE MERCIFUL
4071-39913-0041 I WANTED TO CALL MOTHER BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET ME SHE WENT AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM TRAILING ALONG THE DARK HALL IN HER DRESS AND VEIL AND LOCKED HERSELF IN WELL I TOLD IT ALL TO THE OTHERS IN SOME FASHION
4071-39913-0042 BUT THIS WAS IN REAL LIFE AND ELIZA DID NOT DIE ALTHOUGH MANY TIMES WE THOUGHT SHE WOULD WHEN SHE DID RECOVER HOW FRIGHTFULLY CHANGED SHE WAS IT ALMOST BROKE MY HEART TO SEE HER HER VERY NATURE SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED TOO
4071-39913-0043 ALL HER JOYOUSNESS AND LIGHT HEARTEDNESS WERE DEAD FROM THAT TIME SHE WAS A FADED DISPIRITED CREATURE NO MORE LIKE THE ELIZA WE HAD KNOWN THAN THE MEREST STRANGER AND THEN AFTER A WHILE CAME OTHER NEWS
4071-39913-0044 WILLIS STARR WAS MARRIED TO THE OTHER ELIZA LAURANCE THE TRUE HEIRESS HE HAD MADE NO SECOND MISTAKE WE TRIED TO KEEP IT FROM ELIZA
4071-39913-0045 THAT WAS THE DAY SHE CAME UP HERE ALONE AND PACKED THIS OLD CHEST NOBODY EVER KNEW JUST WHAT SHE PUT INTO IT BUT YOU AND I SEE NOW AMY HER BALL DRESS HER WEDDING GOWN HER LOVE LETTERS AND
4071-39913-0046 MORE THAN ALL ELSE HER YOUTH AND HAPPINESS THIS OLD CHEST WAS THE TOMB OF IT ALL ELIZA LAURANCE WAS REALLY BURIED HERE SHE WENT HOME SOON AFTER
4071-39913-0047 AND I DO NOT THINK SHE EVER INTENDED TO AND I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN THAT IS THE STORY OF THE OLD CHEST IT WAS ALL OVER SO LONG AGO THE HEARTBREAK AND THE MISERY BUT IT ALL SEEMS TO COME BACK TO ME NOW POOR ELIZA
4071-39913-0048 LET US PUT ALL THESE THINGS BACK IN THEIR GRAVE AMY SHE SAID THEY ARE OF NO USE TO ANYONE NOW THE LINEN MIGHT BE BLEACHED AND USED I DARE SAY BUT IT WOULD SEEM LIKE A SACRILEGE IT WAS MOTHER'S WEDDING PRESENT TO ELIZA
4071-39913-0049 I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THAT REVERENTLY WE PUT GOWNS AND LETTERS AND TRINKETS BACK INTO THE OLD BLUE CHEST AUNT WINNIFRED CLOSED THE LID AND TURNED THE KEY SOFTLY
