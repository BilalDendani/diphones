690-133452-0000 OLD SIMPSON HARKER WHO SAT NEAR THE LIBRARIAN'S TABLE HIS HANDS FOLDED ON THE CROOK OF HIS STOUT WALKING STICK GLANCED OUT OF A PAIR OF UNUSUALLY SHREWD AND BRIGHT EYES AT BRYCE AS HE CROSSED THE ROOM AND APPROACHED THE PAIR OF GOSSIPERS
690-133452-0001 I THINK THE DOCTOR WAS THERE WHEN THAT BOOK YOU'RE SPEAKING OF WAS FOUND HE REMARKED SO I UNDERSTOOD FROM MITCHINGTON YES I WAS THERE SAID BRYCE WHO WAS NOT UNWILLING TO JOIN IN THE TALK HE TURNED TO CAMPANY
690-133452-0002 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THERE'S A CLUE IN THAT HE ASKED WHY THIS ANSWERED THE LIBRARIAN HERE'S A MAN IN POSSESSION OF AN OLD HISTORY OF BARTHORPE BARTHORPE IS A SMALL MARKET TOWN IN THE MIDLANDS LEICESTERSHIRE I BELIEVE
690-133452-0003 OF NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE THAT I KNOW OF BUT DOUBTLESS WITH A STORY OF ITS OWN WHY SHOULD ANY ONE BUT A BARTHORPE MAN PAST OR PRESENT BE INTERESTED IN THAT STORY SO FAR AS TO CARRY AN OLD ACCOUNT OF IT WITH HIM
690-133452-0004 THEREFORE I CONCLUDE THIS STRANGER WAS A BARTHORPE MAN AND IT'S AT BARTHORPE THAT I SHOULD MAKE INQUIRIES ABOUT HIM SIMPSON HARKER MADE NO REMARK AND BRYCE REMEMBERED WHAT MISTER DELLINGHAM HAD SAID WHEN THE BOOK WAS FOUND
690-133452-0005 OH I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED CARELESSLY I DON'T SEE THAT THAT FOLLOWS I SAW THE BOOK A CURIOUS OLD BINDING AND QUEER OLD COPPER PLATES THE MAN MAY HAVE PICKED IT UP FOR THAT REASON I'VE BOUGHT OLD BOOKS MYSELF FOR LESS
690-133452-0006 ALL THE SAME RETORTED CAMPANY I SHOULD MAKE INQUIRY AT BARTHORPE YOU'VE GOT TO GO ON PROBABILITIES THE PROBABILITIES IN THIS CASE ARE THAT THE MAN WAS INTERESTED IN THE BOOK BECAUSE IT DEALT WITH HIS OWN TOWN
690-133452-0007 BRYCE TURNED AWAY TOWARDS A WALL ON WHICH HUNG A NUMBER OF CHARTS AND PLANS OF WRYCHESTER CATHEDRAL AND ITS PRECINCTS IT WAS TO INSPECT ONE OF THESE THAT HE HAD COME TO THE LIBRARY
690-133452-0008 BUT SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT THERE WAS A QUESTION WHICH HE COULD ASK WITHOUT EXCITING ANY SUSPICION OR SURMISE HE FACED ROUND AGAIN ON THE LIBRARIAN ISN'T THERE A REGISTER OF BURIALS WITHIN THE CATHEDRAL HE INQUIRED SOME BOOK IN WHICH THEY'RE PUT DOWN
690-133452-0009 CAMPANY LIFTED HIS QUILL PEN AND POINTED TO A CASE OF BIG LEATHER BOUND VOLUMES IN A FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM THIRD SHELF FROM THE BOTTOM DOCTOR HE REPLIED YOU'LL SEE TWO BOOKS THERE ONE'S THE REGISTER OF ALL BURIALS WITHIN THE CATHEDRAL ITSELF UP TO DATE
690-133452-0010 THE OTHER'S THE REGISTER OF THOSE IN PARADISE AND THE CLOISTERS WHAT NAMES ARE YOU WANTING TO TRACE BUT BRYCE AFFECTED NOT TO HEAR THE LAST QUESTION HE WALKED OVER TO THE PLACE WHICH CAMPANY HAD INDICATED
690-133452-0011 AND TAKING DOWN THE SECOND BOOK CARRIED IT TO AN ADJACENT TABLE CAMPANY CALLED ACROSS THE ROOM TO HIM YOU'LL FIND USEFUL INDEXES AT THE END HE SAID THEY'RE ALL BROUGHT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME FROM FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO NEARLY
690-133452-0012 BRYCE TURNED TO THE INDEX AT THE END OF HIS BOOK AN INDEX WRITTEN OUT IN VARIOUS STYLES OF HANDWRITING AND WITHIN A MINUTE HE FOUND THE NAME HE WANTED THERE IT WAS PLAINLY BEFORE HIM
690-133452-0013 RICHARD JENKINS DIED MARCH EIGHTH SEVENTEEN FIFTEEN BURIED IN PARADISE MARCH TENTH HE NEARLY LAUGHED ALOUD AT THE EASE WITH WHICH HE WAS TRACING OUT WHAT AT FIRST HAD SEEMED A DIFFICULT MATTER TO INVESTIGATE
690-133452-0014 BUT LEST HIS TASK SHOULD SEEM TOO EASY HE CONTINUED TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES OF THE BIG FOLIO AND IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE IF THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD ASK HIM ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS HE MEMORIZED SOME OF THE NAMES WHICH HE SAW AND AFTER A WHILE HE TOOK THE BOOK BACK TO ITS SHELF
690-133452-0015 AND TURNED TO THE WALL ON WHICH THE CHARTS AND MAPS WERE HUNG THERE WAS ONE THERE OF PARADISE WHEREON WAS MARKED THE SITE AND NAMES OF ALL THE TOMBS AND GRAVES IN THAT ANCIENT ENCLOSURE
690-133452-0016 BUT HERE BRYCE MET HIS FIRST CHECK DOWN EACH SIDE OF THE OLD CHART DATED EIGHTEEN FIFTY THERE WAS A TABULATED LIST OF THE TOMBS IN PARADISE THE NAMES OF FAMILIES AND PERSONS WERE GIVEN IN THIS LIST
690-133452-0017 AGAINST EACH NAME WAS A NUMBER CORRESPONDING WITH THE SAME NUMBER MARKED ON THE VARIOUS DIVISIONS OF THE CHART
690-133452-0018 OBVIOUSLY IF THE TOMB OF RICHARD JENKINS WHO WAS BURIED IN PARADISE IN SEVENTEEN FIFTEEN
690-133452-0019 THE NAME AND INSCRIPTION ON IT HAD VANISHED WORN AWAY BY TIME AND WEATHER WHEN THAT CHART HAD BEEN MADE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE YEARS LATER
690-133452-0020 HE TURNED AWAY AT LAST FROM THE CHART AT A LOSS AND CAMPANY GLANCED AT HIM FOUND WHAT YOU WANTED HE ASKED OH YES REPLIED BRYCE PRIMED WITH A READY ANSWER I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHERE THE SPELBANKS WERE BURIED QUITE A LOT OF THEM I SEE
690-133452-0021 SOUTHEAST CORNER OF PARADISE SAID CAMPANY SEVERAL TOMBS I COULD HAVE SPARED YOU THE TROUBLE OF LOOKING YOU'RE A REGULAR ENCYCLOPAEDIA ABOUT THE PLACE LAUGHED BRYCE I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW EVERY SPOUT AND GARGOYLE OUGHT TO ANSWERED THE LIBRARIAN
690-133452-0022 I'VE BEEN FED ON IT MAN AND BOY FOR FIVE AND FORTY YEARS BRYCE MADE SOME FITTING REMARK AND WENT OUT AND HOME TO HIS ROOMS THERE TO SPEND MOST OF THE ENSUING EVENING IN TRYING TO PUZZLE OUT THE VARIOUS MYSTERIES OF THE DAY
690-133452-0023 HE GOT NO MORE LIGHT ON THEM THEN AND HE WAS STILL EXERCISING HIS BRAINS ON THEM WHEN HE WENT TO THE INQUEST NEXT MORNING TO FIND THE CORONER'S COURT PACKED TO THE DOORS WITH AN ASSEMBLAGE OF TOWNSFOLK JUST AS CURIOUS AS HE WAS
690-133452-0024 AND AS HE SAT THERE LISTENING TO THE PRELIMINARIES AND TO THE EVIDENCE OF THE FIRST WITNESSES HIS ACTIVE AND SCHEMING MIND FIGURED TO ITSELF NOT WITHOUT MUCH CYNICAL AMUSEMENT
690-133452-0025 HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE MIGHT TELL IF HE TOLD ALL THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE MIGHT GET OUT OF RANSFORD IF HE BRYCE WERE CORONER OR SOLICITOR AND HAD RANSFORD IN THAT WITNESS BOX HE WOULD ASK HIM ON HIS OATH IF HE KNEW THAT DEAD MAN
690-133452-0026 IF HE HAD HAD DEALINGS WITH HIM IN TIMES PAST IF HE HAD MET AND SPOKEN TO HIM ON THAT EVENTFUL MORNING HE WOULD ASK HIM POINT BLANK IF IT WAS NOT HIS HAND THAT HAD THROWN HIM TO HIS DEATH BUT BRYCE HAD NO INTENTION OF MAKING ANY REVELATIONS JUST THEN
690-133452-0027 AS FOR HIMSELF HE WAS GOING TO TELL JUST AS MUCH AS HE PLEASED AND NO MORE
690-133452-0028 AND THAT THAT MAN WAS HIMSELF THE EVIDENCE GIVEN IN THE FIRST STAGES OF THE INQUIRY WAS ALL KNOWN TO BRYCE AND TO MOST PEOPLE IN THE COURT ALREADY
690-133452-0029 JOURNEYING FROM LONDON TO WRYCHESTER MISSUS PARTINGLEY TOLD HOW HE HAD ARRIVED AT THE MITRE REGISTERED IN HER BOOK AS MISTER JOHN BRADEN AND HAD NEXT MORNING ASKED IF HE COULD GET A CONVEYANCE FOR SAXONSTEADE IN THE AFTERNOON AS HE WISHED TO SEE THE DUKE
690-133452-0030 MISTER FOLLIOT TESTIFIED TO HAVING SEEN HIM IN THE CATHEDRAL GOING TOWARDS ONE OF THE STAIRWAYS LEADING TO THE GALLERY VARNER MOST IMPORTANT WITNESS OF ALL UP TO THAT POINT TOLD OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN
690-133452-0031 BRYCE HIMSELF FOLLOWED BY RANSFORD GAVE MEDICAL EVIDENCE MITCHINGTON TOLD OF HIS EXAMINATION OF THE DEAD MAN'S CLOTHING AND EFFECTS IN HIS ROOM AT THE MITRE AND MITCHINGTON ADDED THE FIRST INFORMATION WHICH WAS NEW TO BRYCE
690-133452-0032 IN CONSEQUENCE OF FINDING THE BOOK ABOUT BARTHORPE IN THE SUIT CASE SAID MITCHINGTON WE SENT A LONG TELEGRAM YESTERDAY TO THE POLICE THERE TELLING THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED
690-133452-0033 AND ASKING THEM TO MAKE THE MOST CAREFUL INQUIRIES AT ONCE ABOUT ANY TOWNSMAN OF THEIRS OF THE NAME OF JOHN BRADEN AND TO WIRE US THE RESULT OF SUCH INQUIRIES THIS MORNING THIS IS THEIR REPLY RECEIVED BY US AN HOUR AGO
690-133452-0034 NOTHING WHATEVER IS KNOWN AT BARTHORPE WHICH IS A VERY SMALL TOWN OF ANY PERSON OF THAT NAME SO MUCH FOR THAT THOUGHT BRYCE HE TURNED WITH MORE INTEREST TO THE NEXT WITNESS THE DUKE OF SAXONSTEADE THE GREAT LOCAL MAGNATE
690-133452-0035 A BIG BLUFF MAN WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT IN COURT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH HE WAS MANIFESTLY HIGHLY INTERESTED IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL SOMETHING OF MOMENT HE MIGHT AFTER ALL KNOW SOMETHING OF THIS APPARENTLY MYSTERIOUS STRANGER
690-133452-0036 WHO FOR ANYTHING THAT MISSUS PARTINGLEY OR ANYBODY ELSE COULD SAY TO THE CONTRARY MIGHT HAVE HAD AN APPOINTMENT AND BUSINESS WITH HIM BUT HIS GRACE KNEW NOTHING
690-133452-0037 HE HAD JUST SEEN THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE MAN AND HAD LOOKED CAREFULLY AT THE FEATURES HE WAS NOT A MAN OF WHOM HE HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE WHATEVER HE COULD NOT RECOLLECT EVER HAVING SEEN HIM ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME HE KNEW LITERALLY NOTHING OF HIM
690-133452-0038 COULD NOT THINK OF ANY REASON AT ALL WHY THIS MISTER JOHN BRADEN SHOULD WISH TO SEE HIM
690-133452-0039 SOME OF THEM PERHAPS WITH MEN WHOM YOUR GRACE ONLY SAW FOR A BRIEF SPACE OF TIME A FEW MINUTES POSSIBLY YOU DON'T REMEMBER EVER SEEING THIS MAN IN THAT WAY I'M CREDITED WITH HAVING AN UNUSUALLY GOOD MEMORY FOR FACES ANSWERED THE DUKE
690-133452-0040 AND IF I MAY SAY SO RIGHTLY BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THIS MAN AT ALL IN FACT I'D GO AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT I'M POSITIVE I'VE NEVER KNOWINGLY SET EYES ON HIM IN MY LIFE
690-133452-0041 NONE BUT THEN REPLIED THE DUKE THERE MIGHT BE MANY REASONS UNKNOWN TO ME BUT AT WHICH I CAN MAKE A GUESS IF HE WAS AN ANTIQUARY THERE ARE LOTS OF OLD THINGS AT SAXONSTEADE WHICH HE MIGHT WISH TO SEE OR HE MIGHT BE A LOVER OF PICTURES
690-133452-0042 OUR COLLECTION IS A BIT FAMOUS YOU KNOW PERHAPS HE WAS A BOOKMAN WE HAVE SOME RARE EDITIONS
690-133452-0043 THE FACT IS YOUR GRACE DOESN'T KNOW HIM AND KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT HIM OBSERVED THE CORONER
690-133452-0044 IT WAS AT THIS STAGE THAT THE CORONER SENT THE JURYMEN AWAY IN CHARGE OF HIS OFFICER TO MAKE A CAREFUL PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE GALLERY IN THE CLERESTORY AND WHILE THEY WERE GONE THERE WAS SOME COMMOTION CAUSED IN THE COURT BY THE ENTRANCE OF A POLICE OFFICIAL
690-133452-0045 WHO CONDUCTED TO THE CORONER A MIDDLE AGED WELL DRESSED MAN WHOM BRYCE AT ONCE SET DOWN AS A LONDON COMMERCIAL MAGNATE OF SOME QUALITY BETWEEN THE NEW ARRIVAL AND THE CORONER AN INTERCHANGE OF REMARKS WAS AT ONCE MADE
690-133452-0046 SHARED IN PRESENTLY BY SOME OF THE OFFICIALS AT THE TABLE AND WHEN THE JURY CAME BACK THE STRANGER WAS AT ONCE USHERED INTO THE WITNESS BOX AND THE CORONER TURNED TO THE JURY AND THE COURT
690-133452-0047 WE ARE UNEXPECTEDLY ABLE TO GET SOME EVIDENCE OF IDENTITY GENTLEMEN HE OBSERVED THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS JUST STEPPED INTO THE WITNESS BOX IS MISTER ALEXANDER CHILSTONE MANAGER OF THE LONDON AND COLONIES BANK IN THREADNEEDLE STREET
690-133452-0048 MISTER CHILSTONE SAW PARTICULARS OF THIS MATTER IN THE NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING AND HE AT ONCE SET OFF TO WRYCHESTER TO TELL US WHAT HE KNOWS OF THE DEAD MAN WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO MISTER CHILSTONE
690-133452-0049 IN THE MIDST OF THE MURMUR OF SENSATION WHICH RAN ROUND THE COURT
690-133452-0050 BEYOND THE TABLE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HE SAW AT ONCE THAT RANSFORD HOWEVER STRENUOUSLY HE MIGHT BE FIGHTING TO KEEP HIS FACE UNDER CONTROL
690-133452-0051 HIS CHEEKS HAD PALED HIS EYES WERE A LITTLE DILATED
690-133452-0052 ALTOGETHER IT WAS MORE THAN MERE CURIOSITY THAT WAS INDICATED ON HIS FEATURES AND BRYCE SATISFIED AND SECRETLY ELATED TURNED TO HEAR WHAT MISTER ALEXANDER CHILSTONE HAD TO TELL
690-133452-0053 BUT IT WAS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE SAID MISTER CHILSTONE THAT WAS ON THE DAY PREVIOUS TO HIS DEATH MISTER JOHN BRADEN HAD CALLED AT THE LONDON AND COLONIES BANK OF WHICH HE MISTER CHILSTONE WAS MANAGER
690-133452-0054 AND INTRODUCING HIMSELF AS HAVING JUST ARRIVED IN ENGLAND FROM AUSTRALIA WHERE HE SAID HE HAD BEEN LIVING FOR SOME YEARS HAD ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT HE PRODUCED SOME REFERENCES FROM AGENTS OF THE LONDON AND COLONIES BANK IN MELBOURNE WHICH WERE HIGHLY SATISFACTORY
690-133452-0055 THE ACCOUNT BEING OPENED HE PAID INTO IT A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS IN A DRAFT AT SIGHT DRAWN BY ONE OF THOSE AGENTS HE DREW NOTHING AGAINST THIS REMARKING CASUALLY THAT HE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY IN HIS POCKET FOR THE PRESENT HE DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE CHEQUE BOOK WHICH WAS OFFERED HIM
690-133452-0056 SAYING THAT HE WOULD CALL FOR IT LATER HE DID NOT GIVE US ANY ADDRESS IN LONDON NOR IN ENGLAND CONTINUED THE WITNESS HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD ONLY ARRIVED AT CHARING CROSS THAT VERY MORNING HAVING TRAVELLED FROM PARIS DURING THE NIGHT
690-133452-0057 HE SAID THAT HE SHOULD SETTLE DOWN FOR A TIME AT SOME RESIDENTIAL HOTEL IN LONDON AND IN THE MEANTIME HE HAD ONE OR TWO CALLS OR VISITS TO MAKE IN THE COUNTRY WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THEM HE SAID HE WOULD CALL ON ME AGAIN HE GAVE ME VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT HIMSELF
690-133452-0058 IT WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR HIS REFERENCES FROM OUR AGENTS IN AUSTRALIA WERE QUITE SATISFACTORY BUT HE DID MENTION THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT THERE FOR SOME YEARS AND HAD SPECULATED IN LANDED PROPERTY HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS NOW GOING TO SETTLE IN ENGLAND FOR GOOD
690-133452-0059 THAT CONCLUDED MISTER CHILSTONE IS ALL I CAN TELL OF MY OWN KNOWLEDGE BUT HE ADDED DRAWING A NEWSPAPER FROM HIS POCKET HERE IS AN ADVERTISEMENT WHICH I NOTICED IN THIS MORNING'S TIMES AS I CAME DOWN YOU WILL OBSERVE HE SAID AS HE PASSED IT TO THE CORONER
690-133452-0060 THE ADVERTISEMENT IS AS FOLLOWS HE ANNOUNCED IF THIS MEETS THE EYE OF OLD FRIEND MARCO HE WILL LEARN THAT STICKER WISHES TO SEE HIM AGAIN WRITE J BRADEN
690-133452-0061 WAS HE MISTAKEN IN BELIEVING THAT HE SAW HIM START
690-133452-0062 AND BRYCE TURNED AGAIN TO CORONER AND WITNESS BUT THE WITNESS HAD NO MORE TO SAY EXCEPT TO SUGGEST THAT THE BANK'S MELBOURNE AGENTS SHOULD BE CABLED TO FOR INFORMATION SINCE IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT MUCH MORE COULD BE GOT IN ENGLAND
690-133452-0063 AND WITH THAT THE MIDDLE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS ENDED AND THE LAST ONE CAME WATCHED BY BRYCE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY FOR IT WAS SOON EVIDENT FROM CERTAIN REMARKS MADE BY THE CORONER
690-133452-0064 THAT THE THEORY WHICH ARCHDALE HAD PUT FORWARD AT THE CLUB IN BRYCE'S HEARING THE PREVIOUS DAY HAD GAINED FAVOUR WITH THE AUTHORITIES AND THAT THE VISIT OF THE JURYMEN TO THE SCENE OF THE DISASTER HAD BEEN INTENDED BY THE CORONER TO PREDISPOSE THEM IN BEHALF OF IT
690-133452-0065 AND NOW ARCHDALE HIMSELF AS REPRESENTING THE ARCHITECTS WHO HELD A RETAINING FEE IN CONNECTION WITH THE CATHEDRAL WAS CALLED TO GIVE HIS OPINION
690-133452-0066 AFTER HIM CAME THE MASTER MASON EXPRESSING THE SAME DECIDED CONVICTION THAT THE REAL TRUTH WAS THAT THE PAVEMENT OF THE GALLERY HAD AT THAT PARTICULAR PLACE BECOME SO SMOOTH AND WAS INCLINED TOWARDS THE OPEN DOORWAY AT SUCH A SHARP ANGLE
690-133452-0067 THAT THE UNFORTUNATE MAN HAD LOST HIS FOOTING ON IT AND BEFORE HE COULD RECOVER IT HAD BEEN SHOT OUT OF THE ARCH AND OVER THE BROKEN HEAD OF SAINT WRYTHA'S STAIR AND THOUGH AT A JURYMAN'S WISH VARNER WAS RECALLED AND STUCK STOUTLY TO HIS ORIGINAL STORY OF HAVING SEEN A HAND
690-133452-0068 WHICH HE PROTESTED WAS CERTAINLY NOT THAT OF THE DEAD MAN IT SOON BECAME PLAIN THAT THE JURY SHARED THE CORONER'S BELIEF THAT VARNER IN HIS FRIGHT AND EXCITEMENT HAD BEEN MISTAKEN AND NO ONE WAS SURPRISED WHEN THE FOREMAN AFTER A VERY BRIEF CONSULTATION WITH HIS FELLOWS
690-133452-0069 ANNOUNCED A VERDICT OF DEATH BY MISADVENTURE
690-133452-0070 THAT'S A GOOD JOB ANYWAY NASTY THING DOCTOR
