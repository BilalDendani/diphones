1171-130776-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE ONE DAY ONLY HAD PASSED SINCE ANNE'S CONVERSATION WITH MISSUS SMITH BUT A KEENER INTEREST HAD SUCCEEDED AND SHE WAS NOW SO LITTLE TOUCHED BY MISTER ELLIOT'S CONDUCT EXCEPT BY ITS EFFECTS IN ONE QUARTER
1171-130776-0001 THAT IT BECAME A MATTER OF COURSE THE NEXT MORNING STILL TO DEFER HER EXPLANATORY VISIT IN RIVERS STREET SHE HAD PROMISED TO BE WITH THE MUSGROVES FROM BREAKFAST TO DINNER HER FAITH WAS PLIGHTED AND MISTER ELLIOT'S CHARACTER
1171-130776-0002 MUST LIVE ANOTHER DAY SHE COULD NOT KEEP HER APPOINTMENT PUNCTUALLY HOWEVER THE WEATHER WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND SHE HAD GRIEVED OVER THE RAIN ON HER FRIENDS ACCOUNT AND FELT IT VERY MUCH ON HER OWN BEFORE SHE WAS ABLE TO ATTEMPT THE WALK
1171-130776-0003 WHEN SHE REACHED THE WHITE HART AND MADE HER WAY TO THE PROPER APARTMENT SHE FOUND HERSELF NEITHER ARRIVING QUITE IN TIME NOR THE FIRST TO ARRIVE THE PARTY BEFORE HER WERE MISSUS MUSGROVE TALKING TO MISSUS CROFT
1171-130776-0004 AND CAPTAIN HARVILLE TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AND SHE IMMEDIATELY HEARD THAT MARY AND HENRIETTA TOO IMPATIENT TO WAIT HAD GONE OUT THE MOMENT IT HAD CLEARED BUT WOULD BE BACK AGAIN SOON AND THAT THE STRICTEST INJUNCTIONS HAD BEEN LEFT WITH MISSUS MUSGROVE
1171-130776-0005 SHE HAD ONLY TO SUBMIT SIT DOWN BE OUTWARDLY COMPOSED AND FEEL HERSELF PLUNGED AT ONCE IN ALL THE AGITATIONS WHICH SHE HAD MERELY LAID HER ACCOUNT OF TASTING A LITTLE BEFORE THE MORNING CLOSED
1171-130776-0006 THERE WAS NO DELAY NO WASTE OF TIME SHE WAS DEEP IN THE HAPPINESS OF SUCH MISERY OR THE MISERY OF SUCH HAPPINESS INSTANTLY TWO MINUTES AFTER HER ENTERING THE ROOM CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SAID
1171-130776-0007 WE WILL WRITE THE LETTER WE WERE TALKING OF HARVILLE NOW IF YOU WILL GIVE ME MATERIALS MATERIALS WERE AT HAND ON A SEPARATE TABLE HE WENT TO IT AND NEARLY TURNING HIS BACK TO THEM ALL WAS ENGROSSED BY WRITING
1171-130776-0008 MISSUS MUSGROVE WAS GIVING MISSUS CROFT THE HISTORY OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER'S ENGAGEMENT AND JUST IN THAT INCONVENIENT TONE OF VOICE WHICH WAS PERFECTLY AUDIBLE
1171-130776-0009 ANNE FELT THAT SHE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CONVERSATION AND YET AS CAPTAIN HARVILLE SEEMED THOUGHTFUL AND NOT DISPOSED TO TALK SHE COULD NOT AVOID HEARING MANY UNDESIRABLE PARTICULARS SUCH AS
1171-130776-0010 HOW MISTER MUSGROVE AND MY BROTHER HAYTER HAD MET AGAIN AND AGAIN TO TALK IT OVER WHAT MY BROTHER HAYTER HAD SAID ONE DAY AND WHAT MISTER MUSGROVE HAD PROPOSED THE NEXT AND WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MY SISTER HAYTER AND WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD WISHED
1171-130776-0011 AND WHAT I SAID AT FIRST I NEVER COULD CONSENT TO BUT WAS AFTERWARDS PERSUADED TO THINK MIGHT DO VERY WELL AND A GREAT DEAL IN THE SAME STYLE OF OPEN HEARTED COMMUNICATION MINUTIAE WHICH
1171-130776-0012 EVEN WITH EVERY ADVANTAGE OF TASTE AND DELICACY WHICH GOOD MISSUS MUSGROVE COULD NOT GIVE COULD BE PROPERLY INTERESTING ONLY TO THE PRINCIPALS MISSUS CROFT WAS ATTENDING WITH GREAT GOOD HUMOUR
1171-130776-0013 AND WHENEVER SHE SPOKE AT ALL IT WAS VERY SENSIBLY ANNE HOPED THE GENTLEMEN MIGHT EACH BE TOO MUCH SELF OCCUPIED TO HEAR
1171-130776-0014 SAID MISSUS MUSGROVE IN HER POWERFUL WHISPER THOUGH WE COULD HAVE WISHED IT DIFFERENT YET ALTOGETHER WE DID NOT THINK IT FAIR TO STAND OUT ANY LONGER FOR CHARLES HAYTER WAS QUITE WILD ABOUT IT AND HENRIETTA WAS PRETTY NEAR AS BAD
1171-130776-0015 AND SO WE THOUGHT THEY HAD BETTER MARRY AT ONCE AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT AS MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE BEFORE THEM AT ANY RATE SAID I IT WILL BE BETTER THAN A LONG ENGAGEMENT THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I WAS GOING TO OBSERVE CRIED MISSUS CROFT
1171-130776-0016 I WOULD RATHER HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE SETTLE ON A SMALL INCOME AT ONCE AND HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH A FEW DIFFICULTIES TOGETHER THAN BE INVOLVED IN A LONG ENGAGEMENT I ALWAYS THINK THAT NO MUTUAL OH DEAR MISSUS CROFT CRIED MISSUS MUSGROVE
1171-130776-0017 UNABLE TO LET HER FINISH HER SPEECH
1171-130776-0018 IT IS WHAT I ALWAYS PROTESTED AGAINST FOR MY CHILDREN IT IS ALL VERY WELL I USED TO SAY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ENGAGED IF THERE IS A CERTAINTY OF THEIR BEING ABLE TO MARRY IN SIX MONTHS OR EVEN IN TWELVE BUT A LONG ENGAGEMENT
1171-130776-0019 YES DEAR MA'AM SAID MISSUS CROFT OR AN UNCERTAIN ENGAGEMENT AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH MAY BE LONG TO BEGIN WITHOUT KNOWING THAT AT SUCH A TIME THERE WILL BE THE MEANS OF MARRYING I HOLD TO BE VERY UNSAFE AND UNWISE
1171-130776-0020 AND WHAT I THINK ALL PARENTS SHOULD PREVENT AS FAR AS THEY CAN ANNE FOUND AN UNEXPECTED INTEREST HERE SHE FELT ITS APPLICATION TO HERSELF
1171-130776-0021 FELT IT IN A NERVOUS THRILL ALL OVER HER AND AT THE SAME MOMENT THAT HER EYES INSTINCTIVELY GLANCED TOWARDS THE DISTANT TABLE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S PEN CEASED TO MOVE HIS HEAD WAS RAISED PAUSING LISTENING
1171-130776-0022 AND HE TURNED ROUND THE NEXT INSTANT TO GIVE A LOOK ONE QUICK CONSCIOUS LOOK AT HER THE TWO LADIES CONTINUED TO TALK TO RE URGE THE SAME ADMITTED TRUTHS
1171-130776-0023 AND ENFORCE THEM WITH SUCH EXAMPLES OF THE ILL EFFECT OF A CONTRARY PRACTICE AS HAD FALLEN WITHIN THEIR OBSERVATION BUT ANNE HEARD NOTHING DISTINCTLY IT WAS ONLY A BUZZ OF WORDS IN HER EAR HER MIND WAS IN CONFUSION
1171-130776-0024 CAPTAIN HARVILLE WHO HAD IN TRUTH BEEN HEARING NONE OF IT NOW LEFT HIS SEAT AND MOVED TO A WINDOW AND ANNE SEEMING TO WATCH HIM THOUGH IT WAS FROM THOROUGH ABSENCE OF MIND
1171-130776-0025 BECAME GRADUALLY SENSIBLE THAT HE WAS INVITING HER TO JOIN HIM WHERE HE STOOD HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A SMILE AND A LITTLE MOTION OF THE HEAD WHICH EXPRESSED COME TO ME I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
1171-130776-0026 AND THE UNAFFECTED EASY KINDNESS OF MANNER WHICH DENOTED THE FEELINGS OF AN OLDER ACQUAINTANCE THAN HE REALLY WAS STRONGLY ENFORCED THE INVITATION SHE ROUSED HERSELF AND WENT TO HIM THE WINDOW AT WHICH HE STOOD
1171-130776-0027 WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM FROM WHERE THE TWO LADIES WERE SITTING AND THOUGH NEARER TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S TABLE NOT VERY NEAR AS SHE JOINED HIM CAPTAIN HARVILLE'S COUNTENANCE RE ASSUMED THE SERIOUS THOUGHTFUL EXPRESSION
1171-130776-0028 WHICH SEEMED ITS NATURAL CHARACTER LOOK HERE SAID HE UNFOLDING A PARCEL IN HIS HAND AND DISPLAYING A SMALL MINIATURE PAINTING DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS CERTAINLY CAPTAIN BENWICK
1171-130776-0029 YES AND YOU MAY GUESS WHO IT IS FOR BUT IN A DEEP TONE IT WAS NOT DONE FOR HER MISS ELLIOT DO YOU REMEMBER OUR WALKING TOGETHER AT LYME AND GRIEVING FOR HIM
1171-130776-0030 I LITTLE THOUGHT THEN BUT NO MATTER THIS WAS DRAWN AT THE CAPE HE MET WITH A CLEVER YOUNG GERMAN ARTIST AT THE CAPE AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH A PROMISE TO MY POOR SISTER SAT TO HIM AND WAS BRINGING IT HOME FOR HER
1171-130776-0031 AND I HAVE NOW THE CHARGE OF GETTING IT PROPERLY SET FOR ANOTHER IT WAS A COMMISSION TO ME BUT WHO ELSE WAS THERE TO EMPLOY I HOPE I CAN ALLOW FOR HIM I AM NOT SORRY INDEED TO MAKE IT OVER TO ANOTHER
1171-130776-0032 HE UNDERTAKES IT LOOKING TOWARDS CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HE IS WRITING ABOUT IT NOW AND WITH A QUIVERING LIP HE WOUND UP THE WHOLE BY ADDING POOR FANNY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM SO SOON
1171-130776-0033 NO REPLIED ANNE IN A LOW FEELING VOICE THAT I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT WAS NOT IN HER NATURE SHE DOTED ON HIM IT WOULD NOT BE THE NATURE OF ANY WOMAN WHO TRULY LOVED
1171-130776-0034 IT IS PERHAPS OUR FATE RATHER THAN OUR MERIT WE CANNOT HELP OURSELVES WE LIVE AT HOME QUIET CONFINED AND OUR FEELINGS PREY UPON US YOU ARE FORCED ON EXERTION
1171-130776-0035 YOU HAVE ALWAYS A PROFESSION PURSUITS BUSINESS OF SOME SORT OR OTHER TO TAKE YOU BACK INTO THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY AND CONTINUAL OCCUPATION AND CHANGE SOON WEAKEN IMPRESSIONS
1171-130776-0036 WHICH HOWEVER I DO NOT THINK I SHALL GRANT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO BENWICK HE HAS NOT BEEN FORCED UPON ANY EXERTION THE PEACE TURNED HIM ON SHORE AT THE VERY MOMENT AND HE HAS BEEN LIVING WITH US IN OUR LITTLE FAMILY CIRCLE EVER SINCE
1171-130776-0037 TRUE SAID ANNE VERY TRUE I DID NOT RECOLLECT BUT WHAT SHALL WE SAY NOW CAPTAIN HARVILLE IF THE CHANGE BE NOT FROM OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCES
1171-130776-0038 IT MUST BE FROM WITHIN IT MUST BE NATURE MAN'S NATURE WHICH HAS DONE THE BUSINESS FOR CAPTAIN BENWICK NO NO IT IS NOT MAN'S NATURE
1171-130776-0039 I BELIEVE THE REVERSE I BELIEVE IN A TRUE ANALOGY BETWEEN OUR BODILY FRAMES AND OUR MENTAL AND THAT AS OUR BODIES ARE THE STRONGEST SO ARE OUR FEELINGS CAPABLE OF BEARING MOST ROUGH USAGE AND RIDING OUT THE HEAVIEST WEATHER
1171-130776-0040 YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE THE STRONGEST REPLIED ANNE BUT THE SAME SPIRIT OF ANALOGY WILL AUTHORISE ME TO ASSERT THAT OURS ARE THE MOST TENDER MAN IS MORE ROBUST THAN WOMAN
1171-130776-0041 BUT HE IS NOT LONGER LIVED WHICH EXACTLY EXPLAINS MY VIEW OF THE NATURE OF THEIR ATTACHMENTS NAY IT WOULD BE TOO HARD UPON YOU IF IT WERE OTHERWISE
1171-130776-0042 YOU ARE ALWAYS LABOURING AND TOILING EXPOSED TO EVERY RISK AND HARDSHIP YOUR HOME COUNTRY FRIENDS ALL QUITTED NEITHER TIME NOR HEALTH NOR LIFE TO BE CALLED YOUR OWN IT WOULD BE HARD INDEED WITH A FALTERING VOICE
1171-130776-0043 IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT HIS PEN HAD FALLEN DOWN BUT ANNE WAS STARTLED AT FINDING HIM NEARER THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED AND HALF INCLINED TO SUSPECT THAT THE PEN HAD ONLY FALLEN BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY THEM
1171-130776-0044 STRIVING TO CATCH SOUNDS WHICH YET SHE DID NOT THINK HE COULD HAVE CAUGHT HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR LETTER SAID CAPTAIN HARVILLE NOT QUITE A FEW LINES MORE I SHALL HAVE DONE IN FIVE MINUTES
1171-130776-0045 THERE IS NO HURRY ON MY SIDE I AM ONLY READY WHENEVER YOU ARE I AM IN VERY GOOD ANCHORAGE HERE SMILING AT ANNE WELL SUPPLIED AND WANT FOR NOTHING NO HURRY FOR A SIGNAL AT ALL
1171-130776-0046 WELL MISS ELLIOT LOWERING HIS VOICE
1171-130776-0047 NO MAN AND WOMAN WOULD PROBABLY BUT LET ME OBSERVE THAT ALL HISTORIES ARE AGAINST YOU ALL STORIES PROSE AND VERSE IF I HAD SUCH A MEMORY AS BENWICK I COULD BRING YOU FIFTY QUOTATIONS IN A MOMENT ON MY SIDE THE ARGUMENT
1171-130776-0048 AND I DO NOT THINK I EVER OPENED A BOOK IN MY LIFE WHICH HAD NOT SOMETHING TO SAY UPON WOMAN'S INCONSTANCY SONGS AND PROVERBS ALL TALK OF WOMAN'S FICKLENESS BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL SAY THESE WERE ALL WRITTEN BY MEN
1171-130776-0049 PERHAPS I SHALL YES
1171-130776-0050 MEN HAVE HAD EVERY ADVANTAGE OF US IN TELLING THEIR OWN STORY EDUCATION HAS BEEN THEIRS IN SO MUCH HIGHER A DEGREE THE PEN HAS BEEN IN THEIR HANDS I WILL NOT ALLOW BOOKS TO PROVE ANYTHING BUT HOW SHALL WE PROVE ANYTHING
1171-130776-0051 WE NEVER SHALL WE NEVER CAN EXPECT TO PROVE ANY THING UPON SUCH A POINT IT IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT OF PROOF WE EACH BEGIN PROBABLY WITH A LITTLE BIAS TOWARDS OUR OWN SEX
1171-130776-0052 AND UPON THAT BIAS BUILD EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOUR OF IT WHICH HAS OCCURRED WITHIN OUR OWN CIRCLE MANY OF WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES PERHAPS THOSE VERY CASES WHICH STRIKE US THE MOST
1171-130776-0053 MAY BE PRECISELY SUCH AS CANNOT BE BROUGHT FORWARD WITHOUT BETRAYING A CONFIDENCE OR IN SOME RESPECT SAYING WHAT SHOULD NOT BE SAID AH CRIED CAPTAIN HARVILLE IN A TONE OF STRONG FEELING
1171-130776-0054 IF I COULD BUT MAKE YOU COMPREHEND WHAT A MAN SUFFERS WHEN HE TAKES A LAST LOOK AT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND WATCHES THE BOAT THAT HE HAS SENT THEM OFF IN AS LONG AS IT IS IN SIGHT AND THEN TURNS AWAY AND SAYS GOD KNOWS WHETHER WE EVER MEET AGAIN
1171-130776-0055 AND THEN IF I COULD CONVEY TO YOU THE GLOW OF HIS SOUL WHEN HE DOES SEE THEM AGAIN WHEN
1171-130776-0056 AND OBLIGED TO PUT INTO ANOTHER PORT HE CALCULATES HOW SOON IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET THEM THERE PRETENDING TO DECEIVE HIMSELF AND SAYING THEY CANNOT BE HERE TILL SUCH A DAY BUT ALL THE WHILE HOPING FOR THEM TWELVE HOURS SOONER AND SEEING THEM ARRIVE AT LAST
1171-130776-0057 AS IF HEAVEN HAD GIVEN THEM WINGS BY MANY HOURS SOONER STILL IF I COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU ALL THIS AND ALL THAT A MAN CAN BEAR AND DO AND GLORIES TO DO FOR THE SAKE OF THESE TREASURES OF HIS EXISTENCE I SPEAK YOU KNOW
1171-130776-0058 ONLY OF SUCH MEN AS HAVE HEARTS PRESSING HIS OWN WITH EMOTION OH CRIED ANNE EAGERLY I HOPE I DO JUSTICE TO ALL THAT IS FELT BY YOU AND BY THOSE WHO RESEMBLE YOU
1171-130776-0059 GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD UNDERVALUE THE WARM AND FAITHFUL FEELINGS OF ANY OF MY FELLOW CREATURES I SHOULD DESERVE UTTER CONTEMPT IF I DARED TO SUPPOSE THAT TRUE ATTACHMENT AND CONSTANCY WERE KNOWN ONLY BY WOMAN NO
1171-130776-0060 I BELIEVE YOU CAPABLE OF EVERYTHING GREAT AND GOOD IN YOUR MARRIED LIVES I BELIEVE YOU EQUAL TO EVERY IMPORTANT EXERTION AND TO EVERY DOMESTIC FORBEARANCE SO LONG AS IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE EXPRESSION SO LONG AS YOU HAVE AN OBJECT
1171-130776-0061 I MEAN WHILE THE WOMAN YOU LOVE LIVES AND LIVES FOR YOU ALL THE PRIVILEGE I CLAIM FOR MY OWN SEX
1171-130776-0062 IS THAT OF LOVING LONGEST WHEN EXISTENCE OR WHEN HOPE IS GONE SHE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY HAVE UTTERED ANOTHER SENTENCE HER HEART WAS TOO FULL HER BREATH TOO MUCH OPPRESSED
1171-130776-0063 THERE IS NO QUARRELLING WITH YOU AND WHEN I THINK OF BENWICK MY TONGUE IS TIED THEIR ATTENTION WAS CALLED TOWARDS THE OTHERS MISSUS CROFT WAS TAKING LEAVE

1171-130776-0067 AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAVING SEALED HIS LETTER WITH GREAT RAPIDITY WAS INDEED READY AND HAD EVEN A HURRIED AGITATED AIR WHICH SHEWED IMPATIENCE TO BE GONE
1171-130776-0068 SHE HAD THE KINDEST GOOD MORNING GOD BLESS YOU FROM CAPTAIN HARVILLE BUT FROM HIM NOT A WORD NOR A LOOK HE HAD PASSED OUT OF THE ROOM WITHOUT A LOOK
1171-130776-0069 SHE HAD ONLY TIME HOWEVER TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE TABLE WHERE HE HAD BEEN WRITING WHEN FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD RETURNING THE DOOR OPENED IT WAS HIMSELF HE BEGGED THEIR PARDON
1171-130776-0070 BUT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS GLOVES AND INSTANTLY CROSSING THE ROOM TO THE WRITING TABLE HE DREW OUT A LETTER FROM UNDER THE SCATTERED PAPER PLACED IT BEFORE ANNE WITH EYES OF GLOWING ENTREATY FIXED ON HER FOR A TIME
1171-130776-0071 AND HASTILY COLLECTING HIS GLOVES WAS AGAIN OUT OF THE ROOM ALMOST BEFORE MISSUS MUSGROVE WAS AWARE OF HIS BEING IN IT THE WORK OF AN INSTANT THE REVOLUTION WHICH ONE INSTANT HAD MADE IN ANNE WAS ALMOST BEYOND EXPRESSION THE LETTER
1171-130776-0072 WITH A DIRECTION HARDLY LEGIBLE TO MISS A E WAS EVIDENTLY THE ONE WHICH HE HAD BEEN FOLDING SO HASTILY WHILE SUPPOSED TO BE WRITING ONLY TO CAPTAIN BENWICK
1171-130776-0073 HE HAD BEEN ALSO ADDRESSING HER ON THE CONTENTS OF THAT LETTER DEPENDED ALL WHICH THIS WORLD COULD DO FOR HER ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE ANYTHING MIGHT BE DEFIED RATHER THAN SUSPENSE MISSUS MUSGROVE HAD LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS OF HER OWN AT HER OWN TABLE
1171-130776-0074 TO THEIR PROTECTION SHE MUST TRUST AND SINKING INTO THE CHAIR WHICH HE HAD OCCUPIED SUCCEEDING TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE HAD LEANED AND WRITTEN

1171-130776-0080 BELIEVE IT TO BE MOST FERVENT MOST UNDEVIATING IN F W I MUST GO UNCERTAIN OF MY FATE BUT I SHALL RETURN HITHER OR FOLLOW YOUR PARTY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A WORD
1171-130776-0081 A LOOK WILL BE ENOUGH TO DECIDE WHETHER I ENTER YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE THIS EVENING OR NEVER SUCH A LETTER WAS NOT TO BE SOON RECOVERED FROM HALF AN HOUR'S SOLITUDE AND REFLECTION MIGHT HAVE TRANQUILLIZED HER
1171-130776-0082 BUT THE TEN MINUTES ONLY WHICH NOW PASSED BEFORE SHE WAS INTERRUPTED WITH ALL THE RESTRAINTS OF HER SITUATION COULD DO NOTHING TOWARDS TRANQUILLITY EVERY MOMENT RATHER BROUGHT FRESH AGITATION IT WAS OVERPOWERING HAPPINESS
1171-130776-0083 AND BEFORE SHE WAS BEYOND THE FIRST STAGE OF FULL SENSATION CHARLES MARY AND HENRIETTA ALL CAME IN THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF SEEMING LIKE HERSELF PRODUCED THEN AN IMMEDIATE STRUGGLE BUT AFTER A WHILE SHE COULD DO NO MORE
1171-130776-0084 SHE BEGAN NOT TO UNDERSTAND A WORD THEY SAID AND WAS OBLIGED TO PLEAD INDISPOSITION AND EXCUSE HERSELF THEY COULD THEN SEE THAT SHE LOOKED VERY ILL WERE SHOCKED AND CONCERNED AND WOULD NOT STIR WITHOUT HER FOR THE WORLD
1171-130776-0085 THIS WAS DREADFUL WOULD THEY ONLY HAVE GONE AWAY AND LEFT HER IN THE QUIET POSSESSION OF THAT ROOM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER CURE BUT TO HAVE THEM ALL STANDING OR WAITING AROUND HER WAS DISTRACTING AND IN DESPERATION SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO HOME
1171-130776-0086 BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR CRIED MISSUS MUSGROVE GO HOME DIRECTLY AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF THAT YOU MAY BE FIT FOR THE EVENING I WISH SARAH WAS HERE TO DOCTOR YOU BUT I AM NO DOCTOR MYSELF CHARLES
1171-130776-0087 BUT THE CHAIR WOULD NEVER DO WORSE THAN ALL TO LOSE THE POSSIBILITY OF SPEAKING TWO WORDS TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IN THE COURSE OF HER QUIET SOLITARY PROGRESS UP THE TOWN AND SHE FELT ALMOST CERTAIN OF MEETING HIM COULD NOT BE BORNE
1171-130776-0088 THE CHAIR WAS EARNESTLY PROTESTED AGAINST AND MISSUS MUSGROVE WHO THOUGHT ONLY OF ONE SORT OF ILLNESS HAVING ASSURED HERSELF WITH SOME ANXIETY THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO FALL IN THE CASE
1171-130776-0089 THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HAVING HAD NO FALL COULD PART WITH HER CHEERFULLY AND DEPEND ON FINDING HER BETTER AT NIGHT ANXIOUS TO OMIT NO POSSIBLE PRECAUTION ANNE STRUGGLED AND SAID I AM AFRAID MA'AM
1171-130776-0090 THAT IT IS NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD PRAY BE SO GOOD AS TO MENTION TO THE OTHER GENTLEMEN THAT WE HOPE TO SEE YOUR WHOLE PARTY THIS EVENING I AM AFRAID THERE HAD BEEN SOME MISTAKE AND I WISH YOU PARTICULARLY TO ASSURE CAPTAIN HARVILLE AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAT WE HOPE TO SEE THEM BOTH

1171-130776-0093 CAPTAIN HARVILLE HOLDS HIMSELF QUITE ENGAGED I'LL ANSWER FOR IT AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THE SAME I DARE SAY ANNE COULD DO NO MORE BUT HER HEART PROPHESIED SOME MISCHANCE TO DAMP THE PERFECTION OF HER FELICITY IT COULD NOT BE VERY LASTING HOWEVER
1171-130776-0094 EVEN IF HE DID NOT COME TO CAMDEN PLACE HIMSELF IT WOULD BE IN HER POWER TO SEND AN INTELLIGIBLE SENTENCE BY CAPTAIN HARVILLE ANOTHER MOMENTARY VEXATION OCCURRED CHARLES IN HIS REAL CONCERN AND GOOD NATURE WOULD GO HOME WITH HER
1171-130776-0095 THERE WAS NO PREVENTING HIM THIS WAS ALMOST CRUEL BUT SHE COULD NOT BE LONG UNGRATEFUL HE WAS SACRIFICING AN ENGAGEMENT AT A GUNSMITH'S TO BE OF USE TO HER AND SHE SET OFF WITH HIM WITH NO FEELING BUT GRATITUDE APPARENT
