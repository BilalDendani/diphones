7618-102366-0000 THE NEW VOCABULARY THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION A COMPACT AND THE STATES ACCEDED TO IT EVIDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF AND OF CONTEMPORARY RECORDS
7618-102366-0001 I HAVE HABITUALLY SPOKEN OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION AS A COMPACT AND OF THE PARTIES TO IT AS SOVEREIGN STATES THESE TERMS SHOULD NOT AND IN EARLIER TIMES WOULD NOT HAVE REQUIRED EXPLANATION OR VINDICATION
7618-102366-0002 BUT THEY HAVE BEEN CALLED IN QUESTION BY THE MODERN SCHOOL OF CONSOLIDATION THESE GENTLEMEN ADMIT THAT THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION WAS A COMPACT
7618-102366-0003 MISTER WEBSTER IN HIS REJOINDER TO MISTER HAYNE ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN THIRTY SAID WHEN THE GENTLEMAN SAYS THE CONSTITUTION IS A COMPACT BETWEEN THE STATES HE USES LANGUAGE EXACTLY APPLICABLE TO THE OLD CONFEDERATION
7618-102366-0004 HE SPEAKS AS IF HE WERE IN CONGRESS BEFORE SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE HE DESCRIBES FULLY THAT OLD STATE OF THINGS THEN EXISTING THE CONFEDERATION WAS IN STRICTNESS A COMPACT THE STATES AS STATES WERE PARTIES TO IT
7618-102366-0005 WE HAD NO OTHER GENERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THAT WAS FOUND INSUFFICIENT AND INADEQUATE TO THE PUBLIC EXIGENCIES THE PEOPLE WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH IT AND UNDERTOOK TO ESTABLISH A BETTER
7618-102366-0006 THEY UNDERTOOK TO FORM A GENERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH SHOULD STAND ON A NEW BASIS NOT A CONFEDERACY NOT A LEAGUE NOT A COMPACT BETWEEN STATES
7618-102366-0007 OF THE CONSTITUTION HE SAYS DOES IT CALL ITSELF A COMPACT CERTAINLY NOT IT USES THE WORD COMPACT BUT ONCE
7618-102366-0008 A SUBSISTING TREATY BETWEEN THE STATES CERTAINLY NOT
7618-102366-0009 THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS NOT A COMPACT BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO NOMINATED IN THE BOND AS WELL AS I CAN RECOLLECT THERE IS NO PASSAGE IN THE ILIAD OR THE A ENEID IN WHICH EITHER OF THOSE GREAT WORKS CALLS ITSELF
7618-102366-0010 OR IS CALLED BY ITS AUTHOR AN EPIC POEM YET THIS WOULD SCARCELY BE ACCEPTED AS EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE NOT EPIC POEMS IN AN EXAMINATION OF MISTER WEBSTER'S REMARKS I DO NOT FIND THAT HE ANNOUNCES THEM TO BE EITHER A SPEECH OR AN ARGUMENT
7618-102366-0011 YET THEIR CLAIM TO BOTH THESE TITLES WILL HARDLY BE DISPUTED NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE CONSTITUTION JUST QUOTED THE DISTINCTION ATTEMPTED TO BE DRAWN BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE PROPER TO A CONFEDERATION
7618-102366-0012 AND THAT BELONGING TO A CONSTITUTION AS INDICATING TWO DIFFERENT IDEAS WILL NOT BEAR THE TEST OF EXAMINATION AND APPLICATION TO THE CASE OF THE UNITED STATES IT HAS BEEN FULLY SHOWN IN PREVIOUS CHAPTERS THAT THE TERMS UNION
7618-102366-0013 FEDERAL UNION FEDERAL CONSTITUTION CONSTITUTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE LIKE WERE USED NOT MERELY IN COLLOQUIAL INFORMAL SPEECH BUT IN PUBLIC PROCEEDINGS AND OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
7618-102366-0014 WITH REFERENCE TO THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION AS FREELY AS THEY HAVE SINCE BEEN EMPLOYED UNDER THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION THE FORMER UNION WAS AS MISTER WEBSTER EXPRESSLY ADMITS AS NOBODY DENIES
7618-102366-0015 A COMPACT BETWEEN STATES YET IT NOWHERE CALLS ITSELF A COMPACT THE WORD DOES NOT OCCUR IN IT EVEN THE ONE TIME THAT IT OCCURS IN THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION
7618-102366-0016 ALTHOUGH THE CONTRACTING STATES ARE IN BOTH PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING INTO ANY TREATY CONFEDERATION OR ALLIANCE WITH ONE ANOTHER OR WITH ANY FOREIGN POWER
7618-102366-0017 WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS AND THE CONTRACTING OR CONSTITUENT PARTIES ARE TERMED UNITED STATES IN THE ONE JUST AS IN THE OTHER MISTER WEBSTER IS PARTICULARLY UNFORTUNATE IN HIS CRITICISMS UPON WHAT HE TERMS THE NEW VOCABULARY
7618-102366-0018 IN WHICH THE CONSTITUTION IS STYLED A COMPACT AND THE STATES WHICH RATIFIED IT ARE SPOKEN OF AS HAVING ACCEDED TO IT IN THE SAME SPEECH LAST QUOTED HE SAYS
7618-102366-0019 HAS BEEN CHOSEN FOR USE HERE DOUBTLESS NOT WITHOUT A WELL CONSIDERED PURPOSE THE NATURAL CONVERSE OF ACCESSION IS SECESSION AND THEREFORE
7618-102366-0020 IT MAY BE MORE PLAUSIBLY ARGUED THAT THEY MAY SECEDE FROM IT IF IN ADOPTING THE CONSTITUTION NOTHING WAS DONE BUT ACCEDING TO A COMPACT NOTHING WOULD SEEM NECESSARY IN ORDER TO BREAK IT UP BUT TO SECEDE FROM THE SAME COMPACT
7618-102366-0021 BUT THE TERM IS WHOLLY OUT OF PLACE ACCESSION AS A WORD APPLIED TO POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS IMPLIES COMING INTO A LEAGUE TREATY OR CONFEDERACY BY ONE HITHERTO A STRANGER TO IT AND SECESSION IMPLIES DEPARTING FROM SUCH LEAGUE OR CONFEDERACY
7618-102366-0022 AND ATTRIBUTING THE USE OF THE TERMS WHICH HE ATTACKS TO AN ULTERIOR PURPOSE MISTER WEBSTER SAYS THIS IS THE REASON SIR WHICH MAKES IT NECESSARY TO ABANDON THE USE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE FOR A NEW VOCABULARY
7618-102366-0023 AND TO SUBSTITUTE IN THE PLACE OF PLAIN HISTORICAL FACTS A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS THIS IS THE REASON WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE NEW NAMES TO THINGS
7618-102366-0024 TO SPEAK OF THE CONSTITUTION NOT AS A CONSTITUTION BUT AS A COMPACT AND OF THE RATIFICATIONS BY THE PEOPLE NOT AS RATIFICATIONS
7618-102366-0025 IF THE STATES HAD AS STATES SEVERALLY ACCEDED TO IT ALL WHICH PROPOSITIONS HE DENIES THEN THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATES AND THEIR RIGHT TO SECEDE FROM THE UNION WOULD BE DEDUCIBLE
7618-102366-0026 NOW IT HAPPENS THAT THESE VERY TERMS COMPACT CONFEDERACY ACCEDE AND THE LIKE WERE THE TERMS IN FAMILIAR USE BY THE AUTHORS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THEIR ASSOCIATES WITH REFERENCE TO THAT INSTRUMENT AND ITS RATIFICATION
7618-102366-0027 OTHER WRITERS WHO HAVE EXAMINED THE SUBJECT SINCE THE LATE WAR GAVE IT AN INTEREST WHICH IT HAD NEVER COMMANDED BEFORE HAVE COLLECTED SUCH AN ARRAY OF EVIDENCE IN THIS BEHALF THAT IT IS NECESSARY ONLY TO CITE A FEW EXAMPLES
7618-102366-0028 THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE OF MISTER GERRY OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE CONVENTION OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HAS ALREADY BEEN REFERRED TO IF NINE OUT OF THIRTEEN STATES CAN DISSOLVE THE COMPACT SIX OUT OF NINE WILL BE JUST AS ABLE TO DISSOLVE THE NEW ONE HEREAFTER
7618-102366-0029 HE CAME HERE TO FORM A COMPACT FOR THE GOOD OF AMERICANS HE WAS READY TO DO SO WITH ALL THE STATES HE HOPED AND BELIEVED THEY ALL WOULD ENTER INTO SUCH A COMPACT IF THEY WOULD NOT HE WOULD BE READY TO JOIN WITH ANY STATES THAT WOULD
7618-102366-0030 IF NINE OTHER STATES SHOULD ACCEDE TO THE CONSTITUTION LUTHER MARTIN OF MARYLAND INFORMS US THAT IN A COMMITTEE OF THE GENERAL CONVENTION OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
7618-102366-0031 PROTESTING AGAINST THE PROPOSED VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PERPETUAL UNION ALREADY FORMED UNDER THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION HE MADE USE OF SUCH LANGUAGE AS THIS WILL YOU TELL US WE OUGHT TO TRUST YOU BECAUSE YOU NOW ENTER INTO A SOLEMN COMPACT WITH US
7618-102366-0032 THIS YOU HAVE DONE BEFORE AND NOW TREAT WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT WILL YOU NOW MAKE AN APPEAL TO THE SUPREME BEING AND CALL ON HIM TO GUARANTEE YOUR OBSERVANCE OF THIS COMPACT THE SAME YOU HAVE FORMERLY DONE FOR YOUR OBSERVANCE OF THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION
7618-102366-0033 WAS THE VERY LANGUAGE THEY FAMILIARLY USED
7618-102366-0034 HOWEVER EMINENT FROM AUTHORITY SECOND ONLY IF AT ALL INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF THAT IS FROM THE ACTS OR ORDINANCES OF RATIFICATION BY THE STATES THEY CERTAINLY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CONCLUSIVE AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNKNOWN TO MISTER WEBSTER
7618-102366-0035 FOR THEY ARE THE LANGUAGE OF MASSACHUSETTS THE STATE WHICH HE REPRESENTED IN THE SENATE AND OF NEW HAMPSHIRE THE STATE OF HIS NATIVITY THE RATIFICATION OF MASSACHUSETTS IS EXPRESSED IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
7618-102366-0036 REPORTED TO CONGRESS BY THE CONVENTION OF DELEGATES FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND SUBMITTED TO US BY A RESOLUTION OF THE GENERAL COURT OF THE SAID COMMONWEALTH PASSED THE TWENTY FIFTH DAY OF OCTOBER LAST PAST
7618-102366-0037 AND ACKNOWLEDGING WITH GRATEFUL HEARTS THE GOODNESS OF THE SUPREME RULER OF THE UNIVERSE IN AFFORDING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE COURSE OF HIS PROVIDENCE AN OPPORTUNITY DELIBERATELY AND PEACEABLY WITHOUT FRAUD OR SURPRISE
7618-102366-0038 OF ENTERING INTO AN EXPLICIT AND SOLEMN COMPACT WITH EACH OTHER BY ASSENTING TO AND RATIFYING A NEW CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION ESTABLISH JUSTICE INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILLITY
7618-102366-0039 PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE AND SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR POSTERITY DO IN THE NAME AND IN BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS ASSENT TO
7618-102366-0040 AND RATIFY THE SAID CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
7618-102366-0041 OR GENERAL COURT REFERRED TO AND ALSO THE USE OF THE WORD STATE INSTEAD OF COMMONWEALTH BOTH DISTINCTLY ACCEPT IT AS A COMPACT OF THE STATES WITH EACH OTHER WHICH MISTER WEBSTER A SON OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND A SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS
7618-102366-0042 DECLARED IT WAS NOT AND NOT ONLY SO BUT HE REPUDIATED THE VERY VOCABULARY FROM WHICH THE WORDS EXPRESSING THE DOCTRINE WERE TAKEN IT WOULD NOT NEED HOWEVER THIS ABOUNDING WEALTH OF CONTEMPORANEOUS EXPOSITION
7618-102366-0043 IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE EMPLOYMENT OF ANY PARTICULAR WORDS IN THE CONSTITUTION TO PROVE THAT IT WAS DRAWN UP AS A COMPACT BETWEEN SOVEREIGN STATES ENTERING INTO A CONFEDERACY WITH EACH OTHER
7618-102366-0044 AND THAT THEY RATIFIED AND ACCEDED TO IT SEPARATELY SEVERALLY AND INDEPENDENTLY THE VERY STRUCTURE OF THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT AND THE FACTS ATTENDING ITS PREPARATION AND RATIFICATION WOULD SUFFICE
7618-102366-0045 THE LANGUAGE OF THE FINAL ARTICLE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE ENOUGH THE RATIFICATION OF THE CONVENTIONS OF NINE STATES SHALL BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS CONSTITUTION BETWEEN THE STATES SO RATIFYING THE SAME
7618-102366-0046 THIS IS NOT THE LANGUAGE OF A SUPERIOR IMPOSING A MANDATE UPON SUBORDINATES THE CONSENT OF THE CONTRACTING PARTIES IS NECESSARY TO ITS VALIDITY AND THEN IT BECOMES NOT THE ACCEPTANCE AND RECOGNITION OF AN AUTHORITY OVER THEM
7618-102366-0047 AS MISTER MOTLEY REPRESENTS BUT OF A COMPACT BETWEEN THEM THE SIMPLE WORD BETWEEN IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ANY OTHER IDEA THAN THAT OF A COMPACT BY INDEPENDENT PARTIES IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT ANY DOUBT COULD STILL EXIST
7618-102366-0048 THERE IS ONE PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION WHICH STAMPS ITS CHARACTER AS A COMPACT TOO PLAINLY FOR CAVIL OR QUESTION THE CONSTITUTION
7618-102366-0049 THEREBY BRINGING THE MATTER OF REPRESENTATION WITHIN THE POWER OF AMENDMENT IN ITS FIFTH ARTICLE CONTAINS A STIPULATION THAT NO STATE WITHOUT ITS OWN CONSENT SHALL BE DEPRIVED OF ITS EQUAL SUFFRAGE IN THE SENATE IF THIS IS NOT A COMPACT BETWEEN THE STATES
7618-102366-0050 THE SMALLER STATES HAVE NO GUARANTEE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THEIR EQUALITY OF REPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE
