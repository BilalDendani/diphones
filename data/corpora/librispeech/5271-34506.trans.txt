5271-34506-0000 RUNNING HALFWAY DOWN THE STAIRCASE LEVIN CAUGHT A SOUND HE KNEW A FAMILIAR COUGH IN THE HALL BUT HE HEARD IT INDISTINCTLY THROUGH THE SOUND OF HIS OWN FOOTSTEPS AND HOPED HE WAS MISTAKEN THEN HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A LONG BONY FAMILIAR FIGURE
5271-34506-0001 AND NOW IT SEEMED THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF MISTAKE AND YET HE STILL WENT ON HOPING THAT THIS TALL MAN TAKING OFF HIS FUR CLOAK AND COUGHING WAS NOT HIS BROTHER NIKOLAY LEVIN LOVED HIS BROTHER BUT BEING WITH HIM WAS ALWAYS A TORTURE
5271-34506-0002 JUST NOW WHEN LEVIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE THOUGHTS THAT HAD COME TO HIM AND AGAFEA MIHALOVNA'S HINT WAS IN A TROUBLED AND UNCERTAIN HUMOR
5271-34506-0003 INSTEAD OF A LIVELY HEALTHY VISITOR SOME OUTSIDER WHO WOULD HE HOPED CHEER HIM UP IN HIS UNCERTAIN HUMOR HE HAD TO SEE HIS BROTHER WHO KNEW HIM THROUGH AND THROUGH WHO WOULD CALL FORTH ALL THE THOUGHTS NEAREST HIS HEART
5271-34506-0004 WOULD FORCE HIM TO SHOW HIMSELF FULLY AND THAT HE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO DO ANGRY WITH HIMSELF FOR SO BASE A FEELING LEVIN RAN INTO THE HALL
5271-34506-0005 TERRIBLE AS HIS BROTHER NIKOLAY HAD BEEN BEFORE IN HIS EMACIATION AND SICKLINESS NOW HE LOOKED STILL MORE EMACIATED STILL MORE WASTED HE WAS A SKELETON COVERED WITH SKIN
5271-34506-0006 HE STOOD IN THE HALL JERKING HIS LONG THIN NECK AND PULLING THE SCARF OFF IT AND SMILED A STRANGE AND PITIFUL SMILE WHEN HE SAW THAT SMILE SUBMISSIVE AND HUMBLE LEVIN FELT SOMETHING CLUTCHING AT HIS THROAT YOU SEE I'VE COME TO YOU
5271-34506-0007 NEVER FOR ONE SECOND TAKING HIS EYES OFF HIS BROTHER'S FACE I'VE BEEN MEANING TO A LONG WHILE BUT I'VE BEEN UNWELL ALL THE TIME NOW I'M EVER SO MUCH BETTER HE SAID RUBBING HIS BEARD WITH HIS BIG THIN HANDS YES YES ANSWERED LEVIN
5271-34506-0008 AND HE FELT STILL MORE FRIGHTENED WHEN KISSING HIM HE FELT WITH HIS LIPS THE DRYNESS OF HIS BROTHER'S SKIN AND SAW CLOSE TO HIM HIS BIG EYES FULL OF A STRANGE LIGHT
5271-34506-0009 A FEW WEEKS BEFORE KONSTANTIN LEVIN HAD WRITTEN TO HIS BROTHER THAT THROUGH THE SALE OF THE SMALL PART OF THE PROPERTY THAT HAD REMAINED UNDIVIDED THERE WAS A SUM OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ROUBLES TO COME TO HIM AS HIS SHARE NIKOLAY SAID THAT HE HAD COME NOW TO TAKE THIS MONEY AND
5271-34506-0010 WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO STAY A WHILE IN THE OLD NEST TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE EARTH SO AS TO RENEW HIS STRENGTH LIKE THE HEROES OF OLD FOR THE WORK THAT LAY BEFORE HIM IN SPITE OF HIS EXAGGERATED STOOP AND THE EMACIATION THAT WAS SO STRIKING FROM HIS HEIGHT
5271-34506-0011 HIS MOVEMENTS WERE AS RAPID AND ABRUPT AS EVER LEVIN LED HIM INTO HIS STUDY HIS BROTHER DRESSED WITH PARTICULAR CARE A THING HE NEVER USED TO DO COMBED HIS SCANTY LANK HAIR AND SMILING WENT UPSTAIRS
5271-34506-0012 HE WAS IN THE MOST AFFECTIONATE AND GOOD HUMORED MOOD JUST AS LEVIN OFTEN REMEMBERED HIM IN CHILDHOOD HE EVEN REFERRED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITHOUT RANCOR
5271-34506-0013 THE NEWS OF THE DEATH OF PARFEN DENISITCH MADE A PAINFUL IMPRESSION ON HIM A LOOK OF FEAR CROSSED HIS FACE BUT HE REGAINED HIS SERENITY IMMEDIATELY OF COURSE HE WAS QUITE OLD HE SAID AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT
5271-34506-0014 WELL I'LL SPEND A MONTH OR TWO WITH YOU AND THEN I'M OFF TO MOSCOW DO YOU KNOW MYAKOV HAS PROMISED ME A PLACE THERE AND I'M GOING INTO THE SERVICE NOW I'M GOING TO ARRANGE MY LIFE QUITE DIFFERENTLY HE WENT ON YOU KNOW I GOT RID OF THAT WOMAN MARYA NIKOLAEVNA
5271-34506-0015 WHY WHAT FOR OH SHE WAS A HORRID WOMAN SHE CAUSED ME ALL SORTS OF WORRIES BUT HE DID NOT SAY WHAT THE ANNOYANCES WERE HE COULD NOT SAY THAT HE HAD CAST OFF MARYA NIKOLAEVNA BECAUSE THE TEA WAS WEAK AND ABOVE ALL BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOOK AFTER HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE AN INVALID
5271-34506-0016 BESIDES I WANT TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF COMPLETELY NOW I'VE DONE SILLY THINGS OF COURSE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BUT MONEY'S THE LAST CONSIDERATION I DON'T REGRET IT SO LONG AS THERE'S HEALTH AND MY HEALTH THANK GOD IS QUITE RESTORED
5271-34506-0017 LEVIN LISTENED AND RACKED HIS BRAINS BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY NIKOLAY PROBABLY FELT THE SAME
5271-34506-0018 HE TOLD HIS BROTHER OF HIS PLANS AND HIS DOINGS HIS BROTHER LISTENED BUT EVIDENTLY HE WAS NOT INTERESTED BY IT THESE TWO MEN WERE SO AKIN SO NEAR EACH OTHER THAT THE SLIGHTEST GESTURE THE TONE OF VOICE TOLD BOTH MORE THAN COULD BE SAID IN WORDS
5271-34506-0019 BOTH OF THEM NOW HAD ONLY ONE THOUGHT
5271-34506-0020 WHICH STIFLED ALL ELSE BUT NEITHER OF THEM DARED TO SPEAK OF IT AND SO WHATEVER THEY SAID NOT UTTERING THE ONE THOUGHT THAT FILLED THEIR MINDS WAS ALL FALSEHOOD NEVER HAD LEVIN BEEN SO GLAD WHEN THE EVENING WAS OVER AND IT WAS TIME TO GO TO BED
5271-34506-0021 NEVER WITH ANY OUTSIDE PERSON NEVER ON ANY OFFICIAL VISIT HAD HE BEEN SO UNNATURAL AND FALSE AS HE WAS THAT EVENING AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS UNNATURALNESS AND THE REMORSE HE FELT AT IT MADE HIM EVEN MORE UNNATURAL
5271-34506-0022 AS THE HOUSE WAS DAMP AND ONLY ONE BEDROOM HAD BEEN KEPT HEATED LEVIN PUT HIS BROTHER TO SLEEP IN HIS OWN BEDROOM BEHIND A SCREEN HIS BROTHER GOT INTO BED AND WHETHER HE SLEPT OR DID NOT SLEEP TOSSED ABOUT LIKE A SICK MAN COUGHED AND WHEN HE COULD NOT GET HIS THROAT CLEAR
5271-34506-0023 MUMBLED SOMETHING SOMETIMES WHEN HIS BREATHING WAS PAINFUL HE SAID OH MY GOD SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS CHOKING HE MUTTERED ANGRILY AH THE DEVIL LEVIN COULD NOT SLEEP FOR A LONG WHILE HEARING HIM
5271-34506-0024 HIS THOUGHTS WERE OF THE MOST VARIOUS BUT THE END OF ALL HIS THOUGHTS WAS THE SAME DEATH DEATH THE INEVITABLE END OF ALL FOR THE FIRST TIME PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM WITH IRRESISTIBLE FORCE AND DEATH WHICH WAS HERE IN THIS LOVED BROTHER
5271-34506-0025 GROANING HALF ASLEEP AND FROM HABIT CALLING WITHOUT DISTINCTION ON GOD AND THE DEVIL WAS NOT SO REMOTE AS IT HAD HITHERTO SEEMED TO HIM IT WAS IN HIMSELF TOO HE FELT THAT IF NOT TODAY TOMORROW
5271-34506-0026 IF NOT TOMORROW IN THIRTY YEARS WASN'T IT ALL THE SAME AND WHAT WAS THIS INEVITABLE DEATH HE DID NOT KNOW HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND WHAT WAS MORE HAD NOT THE POWER HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO THINK ABOUT IT I WORK I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
5271-34506-0027 BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN IT MUST ALL END I HAD FORGOTTEN DEATH HE SAT ON HIS BED IN THE DARKNESS CROUCHED UP HUGGING HIS KNEES AND HOLDING HIS BREATH FROM THE STRAIN OF THOUGHT HE PONDERED BUT THE MORE INTENSELY HE THOUGHT THE CLEARER IT BECAME TO HIM THAT IT WAS INDUBITABLY SO
5271-34506-0028 THAT DEATH WILL COME AND ALL ENDS THAT NOTHING WAS EVEN WORTH BEGINNING AND THAT THERE WAS NO HELPING IT ANYWAY YES IT WAS AWFUL BUT IT WAS SO BUT I AM ALIVE STILL NOW WHAT'S TO BE DONE WHAT'S TO BE DONE HE SAID IN DESPAIR
5271-34506-0029 HE LIGHTED A CANDLE GOT UP CAUTIOUSLY AND WENT TO THE LOOKING GLASS AND BEGAN LOOKING AT HIS FACE AND HAIR YES THERE WERE GRAY HAIRS ABOUT HIS TEMPLES HE OPENED HIS MOUTH HIS BACK TEETH WERE BEGINNING TO DECAY HE BARED HIS MUSCULAR ARMS
5271-34506-0030 YES THERE WAS STRENGTH IN THEM
5271-34506-0031 AND SUDDENLY HE RECALLED HOW THEY USED TO GO TO BED TOGETHER AS CHILDREN AND HOW THEY ONLY WAITED TILL FYODOR BOGDANITCH WAS OUT OF THE ROOM TO FLING PILLOWS AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGH LAUGH IRREPRESSIBLY
5271-34506-0032 SO THAT EVEN THEIR AWE OF FYODOR BOGDANITCH COULD NOT CHECK THE EFFERVESCING OVERBRIMMING SENSE OF LIFE AND HAPPINESS AND NOW THAT BENT HOLLOW CHEST
5271-34506-0033 WHY DO YOU KEEP FIDGETING WHY DON'T YOU GO TO SLEEP HIS BROTHER'S VOICE CALLED TO HIM OH I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SLEEPY I HAVE HAD A GOOD SLEEP I'M NOT IN A SWEAT NOW JUST SEE FEEL MY SHIRT IT'S NOT WET IS IT LEVIN FELT
5271-34506-0034 WITHDREW BEHIND THE SCREEN AND PUT OUT THE CANDLE BUT FOR A LONG WHILE HE COULD NOT SLEEP THE QUESTION HOW TO LIVE HAD HARDLY BEGUN TO GROW A LITTLE CLEARER TO HIM WHEN A NEW INSOLUBLE QUESTION PRESENTED ITSELF DEATH WHY HE'S DYING
