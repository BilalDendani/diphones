5740-97610-0000 HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER THOUGHT OF WHAT LITTLE PEOPLE LIKE YOU WERE DOING IN THIS COUNTRY MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THE CRUEL TIDE OF WAR SWEPT OVER ITS BOSOM FROM MANY HOMES THE FATHERS WERE ABSENT FIGHTING BRAVELY FOR THE LIBERTY WHICH WE NOW ENJOY
5740-97610-0001 WHILE THE MOTHERS NO LESS VALIANTLY STRUGGLED AGAINST HARDSHIPS AND DISCOMFORTS IN ORDER TO KEEP A HOME FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHOM YOU ONLY KNOW AS YOUR GREAT GRANDFATHERS AND GREAT GRANDMOTHERS DIGNIFIED GENTLEMEN AND BEAUTIFUL LADIES
5740-97610-0002 WHOSE PAINTED PORTRAITS HANG UPON THE WALLS IN SOME OF YOUR HOMES
5740-97610-0003 YET THEIR BRIGHT FACES MUST HAVE LOOKED GRAVE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY HEARD THE GROWN PEOPLE TALK OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING AROUND THEM SOME OF THESE LITTLE PEOPLE NEVER FORGOT THE WONDERFUL EVENTS OF WHICH THEY HEARD
5740-97610-0004 IS ABOUT A BOY AND GIRL WHO LIVED IN BORDENTOWN NEW JERSEY THE FATHER OF THESE CHILDREN WAS A SOLDIER IN GENERAL WASHINGTON'S ARMY WHICH WAS ENCAMPED A FEW MILES NORTH OF TRENTON ON THE PENNSYLVANIA SIDE OF THE DELAWARE RIVER
5740-97610-0005 THUS YOU SEE THAT THE BRITISH IN FORCE WERE BETWEEN WASHINGTON'S ARMY AND BORDENTOWN
5740-97610-0006 COULD NOT IMAGINE SUCH A THING AS CHRISTMAS WITHOUT THEIR FATHER AND HAD BUSIED THEMSELVES FOR WEEKS IN MAKING EVERYTHING READY TO HAVE A MERRY TIME WITH HIM KITTY WHO LOVED TO PLAY QUITE AS MUCH AS ANY FROLICSOME KITTY OF TO DAY HAD SPENT ALL HER SPARE TIME
5740-97610-0007 IN KNITTING A PAIR OF THICK WOOLLEN STOCKINGS WHICH SEEMS A WONDERFUL FEAT FOR A LITTLE GIRL ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLD TO PERFORM CAN YOU NOT SEE HER SITTING BY THE GREAT CHIMNEY PLACE FILLED WITH ITS ROARING CRACKLING LOGS IN HER QUAINT SHORT WAISTED DRESS
5740-97610-0008 KNITTING AWAY STEADILY AND PUCKERING UP HER ROSY DIMPLED FACE OVER THE STRANGE TWISTS AND TURNS OF THAT OLD STOCKING I CAN SEE HER AND I CAN ALSO HEAR HER SWEET VOICE
5740-97610-0009 TO FIND THAT HIS LITTLE GIRL CAN KNIT LIKE A GROWN UP WOMAN WHILE HARRY SPREADS OUT ON THE HEARTH A GOODLY STORE OF SHELLBARKS THAT HE HAS GATHERED AND IS KEEPING FOR HIS SHARE OF THE SPRISE WHAT IF HE SHOULDN'T COME ASKS HARRY SUDDENLY OH HE'LL COME
5740-97610-0010 PAPA NEVER STAYS AWAY ON CHRISTMAS SAYS KITTY LOOKING UP INTO HER MOTHER'S FACE FOR AN ECHO TO HER WORDS INSTEAD SHE SEES SOMETHING VERY LIKE TEARS IN HER MOTHER'S EYES OH MAMMA DON'T YOU THINK HE'LL COME HE WILL COME IF HE POSSIBLY CAN
5740-97610-0011 SAYS MISSUS TRACY AND IF HE CANNOT WE WILL KEEP CHRISTMAS WHENEVER DEAR PAPA DOES COME HOME IT WON'T BE HALF SO NICE SAID KITTY NOTHING'S SO NICE AS REALLY CHRISTMAS AND
5740-97610-0012 WE'LL LET HIM COME JUST THE SAME AND IF HE BRINGS ANYTHING FOR PAPA WE CAN PUT IT AWAY FOR HIM THIS PLAN STILL SEEMED A POOR ONE TO MISS KITTY WHO WENT TO HER BED IN A SOBER MOOD THAT NIGHT
5740-97610-0013 AND WAS HEARD TELLING HER DEAR DOLLIE MARTHA WASHINGTON THAT WARS WERE MIS'ABLE AND THAT WHEN SHE MARRIED SHE SHOULD HAVE A MAN WHO KEPT A CANDY SHOP FOR A HUSBAND AND NOT A SOLDIER NO MARTHA NOT EVEN IF HE'S AS NICE AS PAPA
5740-97610-0014 AS MARTHA MADE NO OBJECTION TO THIS LITTLE ARRANGEMENT BEING AN OBEDIENT CHILD THEY WERE BOTH SOON FAST ASLEEP THE DAYS OF THAT COLD WINTER OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX WORE ON
5740-97610-0015 SO COLD IT WAS THAT THE SUFFERINGS OF THE SOLDIERS WERE GREAT THEIR BLEEDING FEET OFTEN LEAVING MARKS ON THE PURE WHITE SNOW OVER WHICH THEY MARCHED AS CHRISTMAS DREW NEAR THERE WAS A FEELING AMONG THE PATRIOTS
5740-97610-0016 THAT SOME BLOW WAS ABOUT TO BE STRUCK BUT WHAT IT WAS AND FROM WHENCE THEY KNEW NOT AND BETTER THAN ALL THE BRITISH HAD NO IDEA THAT ANY STRONG BLOW COULD COME FROM WASHINGTON'S ARMY WEAK AND OUT OF HEART AS THEY THOUGHT
5740-97610-0017 MISSUS TRACY LOOKED ANXIOUSLY EACH DAY FOR NEWS OF THE HUSBAND AND FATHER ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY YET SO SEPARATED BY THE RIVER AND THE ENEMY'S TROOPS THAT THEY SEEMED LIKE A HUNDRED CHRISTMAS EVE CAME BUT BROUGHT WITH IT
5740-97610-0018 FEW REJOICINGS THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE WERE TOO SAD TO BE TAKEN UP WITH MERRYMAKING
5740-97610-0019 GOOD NATURED GERMANS WHO ONLY FOUGHT THE AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY WERE PAID FOR IT GAVE THEMSELVES UP TO THE FEASTING AND REVELRY SHALL WE HANG UP OUR STOCKINGS ASKED KITTY IN RATHER A DOLEFUL VOICE YES SAID HER MOTHER
5740-97610-0020 SANTA CLAUS WON'T FORGET YOU I AM SURE ALTHOUGH HE HAS BEEN KEPT PRETTY BUSY LOOKING AFTER THE SOLDIERS THIS WINTER WHICH SIDE IS HE ON ASKED HARRY THE RIGHT SIDE OF COURSE SAID MISSUS TRACY WHICH WAS THE MOST SENSIBLE ANSWER SHE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE GIVEN
5740-97610-0021 FOR EACH CHILD HE TURNED FOR A MOMENT TO LOOK AT THE SLEEPING FACES FOR SAINT NICHOLAS HAS A TENDER SPOT IN HIS GREAT BIG HEART FOR A SOLDIER'S CHILDREN THEN REMEMBERING MANY OTHER SMALL FOLKS WAITING FOR HIM ALL OVER THE LAND
5740-97610-0022 HE SPRANG UP THE CHIMNEY AND WAS AWAY IN A TRICE SANTA CLAUS IN THE FORM OF MISSUS TRACY'S FARMER BROTHER BROUGHT HER A SPLENDID TURKEY
5740-97610-0023 HARRY WAS VERY FOND OF TURKEY TOO AS WELL AS OF ALL OTHER GOOD THINGS BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER SAID IT'S SUCH A FINE BIRD IT SEEMS TOO BAD TO EAT IT WITHOUT FATHER HARRY CRIED OUT YES KEEP IT FOR PAPA
5740-97610-0024 AND KITTY JOINING IN THE CHORUS THE VOTE WAS UNANIMOUS AND THE TURKEY WAS HUNG AWAY TO AWAIT THE RETURN OF THE GOOD SOLDIER ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED STRANGE AS KITTY TOLD MARTHA WASHINGTON TO HAVE NO PAPA AND NO TURKEY ON CHRISTMAS DAY
5740-97610-0025 THE DAY PASSED AND NIGHT CAME COLD WITH A STEADY FALL OF RAIN AND SLEET
5740-97610-0026 AND THAT HE MIGHT COME HOME AND WEAR HIS BEAUTIFUL BLUE STOCKINGS AND EAT HIS TURKEY SAID HARRY'S SLEEPY VOICE
5740-97610-0027 TOWARD MORNING THE GOOD PEOPLE IN BORDENTOWN WERE SUDDENLY AROUSED BY FIRING IN THE DISTANCE WHICH BECAME MORE AND MORE DISTINCT AS THE DAY WORE ON THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE TOWN MEN AND WOMEN GATHERED TOGETHER IN LITTLE GROUPS IN THE STREETS
5740-97610-0028 TO WONDER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT AND NEIGHBOURS CAME DROPPING INTO MISSUS TRACY'S PARLOUR ALL DAY LONG ONE AFTER THE OTHER TO SAY WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THE FIRING
5740-97610-0029 TO SAY THAT GENERAL WASHINGTON HAD SURPRISED THE BRITISH AT TRENTON EARLY THAT MORNING AND COMPLETELY ROUTED THEM
5740-97610-0030 THAT THEY LEFT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST CEREMONY IT WAS A JOYFUL HOUR TO THE GOOD TOWN PEOPLE WHEN THE RED JACKETS TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM THINKING EVERY MOMENT THAT THE PATRIOT ARMY WOULD BE AFTER THEM INDEED IT SEEMED AS IF WONDERS WOULD NEVER CEASE THAT DAY
5740-97610-0031 FOR WHILE REJOICINGS WERE STILL LOUD OVER THE DEPARTURE OF THE ENEMY THERE CAME A KNOCK AT MISSUS TRACY'S DOOR AND WHILE SHE WAS WONDERING WHETHER SHE DARED OPEN IT IT WAS PUSHED AJAR AND A TALL SOLDIER ENTERED WHAT A SCREAM OF DELIGHT GREETED THAT SOLDIER
5740-97610-0032 WHILE MISSUS TRACY DREW HIM TOWARD THE WARM BLAZE AND HELPED HIM OFF WITH HIS DAMP CLOAK COLD AND TIRED CAPTAIN TRACY WAS AFTER A NIGHT'S MARCH IN THE STREETS AND A DAY'S FIGHTING BUT HE WAS NOT TOO WEARY TO SMILE AT THE DEAR FACES AROUND HIM
5740-97610-0033 OR TO PAT KITTY'S HEAD WHEN SHE BROUGHT HIS WARM STOCKINGS AND WOULD PUT THEM ON THE TIRED FEET HERSELF SUDDENLY THERE WAS A SHARP QUICK BARK OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHAT'S THAT CRIED HARRY OH I FORGOT OPEN THE DOOR
5740-97610-0034 HERE FIDO FIDO INTO THE ROOM THERE SPRANG A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KING CHARLES SPANIEL WHITE WITH TAN SPOTS AND EARS OF THE LONGEST SOFTEST AND SILKIEST WHAT A LITTLE DEAR EXCLAIMED KITTY WHERE DID IT COME FROM
5740-97610-0035 FROM THE BATTLE OF TRENTON SAID HER FATHER HIS POOR MASTER WAS SHOT AFTER THE RED COATS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS AND I WAS HURRYING ALONG ONE OF THE STREETS WHERE THE FIGHT HAD BEEN THE FIERCEST I HEARD A LOW GROAN
5740-97610-0036 LYING AMONG A NUMBER OF SLAIN I RAISED HIS HEAD HE BEGGED FOR SOME WATER WHICH I BROUGHT HIM AND BENDING DOWN MY EAR I HEARD HIM WHISPER DYING LAST BATTLE SAY A PRAYER HE TRIED TO FOLLOW ME IN THE WORDS OF A PRAYER
5740-97610-0037 AND THEN TAKING MY HAND LAID IT ON SOMETHING SOFT AND WARM
5740-97610-0038 IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO GET THE LITTLE CREATURE AWAY FROM HIS DEAD MASTER HE CLUNG TO HIM AS IF HE LOVED HIM BETTER THAN LIFE
5740-97610-0039 FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT PRETTY LITTLE FIDO SAID KITTY TAKING THE SOFT CURLY CREATURE IN HER ARMS I THINK IT'S THE BEST PRESENT IN THE WORLD AND TO MORROW IS TO BE REAL CHRISTMAS BECAUSE YOU ARE HOME PAPA AND WE'LL EAT THE TURKEY SAID HARRY
5740-97610-0040 AND SHELLBARKS LOTS OF THEM THAT I SAVED FOR YOU WHAT A GOOD TIME WE'LL HAVE AND OH PAPA DON'T GO TO WAR ANY MORE BUT STAY AT HOME WITH MOTHER AND KITTY AND FIDO AND ME WHAT WOULD BECOME OF OUR COUNTRY IF WE SHOULD ALL DO THAT MY LITTLE MAN
5740-97610-0041 IT WAS A GOOD DAY'S WORK THAT WE DID THIS CHRISTMAS GETTING THE ARMY ALL ACROSS THE RIVER SO QUICKLY AND QUIETLY THAT WE SURPRISED THE ENEMY AND GAINED A VICTORY WITH THE LOSS OF FEW MEN
5740-97610-0042 THUS IT WAS THAT SOME OF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX SPENT THEIR CHRISTMAS
