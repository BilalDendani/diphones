4766-1814-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO DAY DAWN ALL THIS TIME THE ATTENDANT GEORGE HAD BEEN SITTING VERY MUCH AT HIS EASE ON HORSEBACK LOOKING AFTER SIR NORMAN'S CHARGER AND ADMIRING THE BEAUTIES OF SUNRISE
4766-1814-0001 HE HAD SEEN SIR NORMAN IN CONVERSATION WITH A STRANGE FEMALE AND NOT MUCH LIKING HIS NEAR PROXIMITY TO THE PLAGUE PIT WAS RATHER IMPATIENT FOR IT TO COME TO AN END
4766-1814-0002 BUT WHEN HE SAW THE TRAGIC MANNER IN WHICH IT DID END HIS CONSTERNATION WAS BEYOND ALL BOUNDS SIR NORMAN IN HIS HORRIFIED FLIGHT WOULD HAVE FAIRLY PASSED HIM UNNOTICED HAD NOT GEORGE ARRESTED HIM BY A LOUD SHOUT
4766-1814-0003 I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR NORMAN HE EXCLAIMED AS THAT GENTLEMAN TURNED HIS DISTRACTED FACE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME YOU ARE RUNNING AWAY HERE IS YOUR HORSE
4766-1814-0004 SIR NORMAN LEANED AGAINST HIS HORSE
4766-1814-0005 WHY DID THAT WOMAN LEAP INTO THE PLAGUE PIT INQUIRED GEORGE LOOKING AT HIM CURIOUSLY WAS IT NOT THE SORCERESS LA MASQUE YES YES DO NOT ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS NOW REPLIED SIR NORMAN IN A SMOTHERED VOICE
4766-1814-0006 AND WITH AN IMPATIENT WAVE OF HIS HAND WHATEVER YOU PLEASE SIR SAID GEORGE WITH THE FLIPPANCY OF HIS CLASS BUT STILL I MUST REPEAT
4766-1814-0007 AND MY MASTER THE COUNT IS NOT ONE WHO BROOKS DELAY
4766-1814-0008 AND STARTED OFF AT A BREAK NECK PACE INTO THE CITY GEORGE ALMOST UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH HIM FOLLOWED INSTEAD OF LEADING
4766-1814-0009 ONCE OR TWICE HE SHOUTED OUT A SHARP TONED INQUIRY AS TO WHETHER HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS GOING AND THAT THEY WERE TAKING THE WRONG WAY ALTOGETHER TO ALL OF WHICH SIR NORMAN DEIGNED NOT THE SLIGHTEST REPLY BUT RODE MORE AND MORE RECKLESSLY ON
4766-1814-0010 THERE WERE BUT FEW PEOPLE ABROAD AT THAT HOUR INDEED FOR THAT MATTER THE STREETS OF LONDON IN THE DISMAL SUMMER OF SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WERE COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING ALWAYS DESERTED
4766-1814-0011 AND THE FEW NOW WENDING THEIR WAY HOMEWARD WERE TIRED PHYSICIANS AND PLAGUE NURSES FROM THE HOSPITALS AND SEVERAL HARDY COUNTRY FOLKS WITH MORE LOVE OF LUCRE THAN FEAR OF DEATH BENDING THEIR STEPS WITH PRODUCE TO THE MARKET PLACE
4766-1814-0012 THESE PEOPLE SLEEPY AND PALLID IN THE GRAY HAZE OF DAYLIGHT STARED IN ASTONISHMENT AFTER THE TWO FURIOUS RIDERS AND WINDOWS WERE THROWN OPEN AND HEADS THRUST OUT TO SEE WHAT THE UNUSUAL THUNDER OF HORSES HOOFS
4766-1814-0013 AT THAT EARLY HOUR MEANT GEORGE FOLLOWED DAUNTLESSLY ON DETERMINED TO DO IT OR DIE IN THE ATTEMPT AND IF HE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE FLYING DUTCHMAN WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
4766-1814-0014 THAT HE WAS JUST THEN FOLLOWING HIS TRACK ON DRY LAND BUT UNLIKE THE HAPLESS VANDERDECKEN SIR NORMAN CAME TO A HALT AT LAST AND THAT SO SUDDENLY THAT HIS HORSE STOOD ON HIS BEAM ENDS AND FLOURISHED HIS TWO FORE LIMBS IN THE ATMOSPHERE
4766-1814-0015 IT WAS BEFORE LA MASQUE'S DOOR AND SIR NORMAN WAS OUT OF THE SADDLE IN A FLASH AND KNOCKING LIKE A POSTMAN WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS WHIP ON THE DOOR
4766-1814-0016 MAKING IT SHAKE TO ITS CENTRE AND HURRIEDLY BROUGHT TO THE DOOR THE ANATOMY WHO ACTED AS GUARDIAN ANGEL OF THE ESTABLISHMENT LA MASQUE IS NOT AT HOME AND I CANNOT ADMIT YOU WAS HIS SHARP SALUTE
4766-1814-0017 THEN I SHALL JUST TAKE THE TROUBLE OF ADMITTING MYSELF SAID SIR NORMAN SHORTLY AND WITHOUT FURTHER CEREMONY HE PUSHED ASIDE THE SKELETON AND ENTERED BUT THAT OUTRAGED SERVITOR SPRANG IN HIS PATH INDIGNANT AND AMAZED
4766-1814-0018 NO SIR I CANNOT PERMIT IT I DO NOT KNOW YOU AND IT IS AGAINST ALL ORDERS TO ADMIT STRANGERS IN LA MASQUE'S ABSENCE BAH YOU OLD SIMPLETON REMARKED SIR NORMAN
4766-1814-0019 LOSING HIS CUSTOMARY RESPECT FOR OLD AGE IN HIS IMPATIENCE I HAVE LA MASQUE'S ORDER FOR WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO GET ALONG WITH YOU DIRECTLY WILL YOU
4766-1814-0020 HE TAPPED HIS SWORD HILT SIGNIFICANTLY AS HE SPOKE AND THAT ARGUMENT PROVED IRRESISTIBLE GRUMBLING IN LOW TONES THE ANATOMY STALKED UP STAIRS AND THE OTHER FOLLOWED
4766-1814-0021 WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS FROM THOSE WITH WHICH HE HAD MOUNTED THAT STAIRCASE LAST HIS GUIDE PAUSED IN THE HALL ABOVE WITH HIS HAND ON THE LATCH OF A DOOR THIS IS HER PRIVATE ROOM IS IT DEMANDED SIR NORMAN YES
4766-1814-0022 JUST STAND ASIDE THEN AND LET ME PASS THE ROOM HE ENTERED WAS SMALL SIMPLY FURNISHED AND SEEMED TO ANSWER AS BED CHAMBER AND STUDY ALL IN ONE
4766-1814-0023 AND HE GLANCED AT THEM WITH SOME CURIOSITY THEY WERE CLASSICS GREEK AND LATIN AND OTHER LITTLE KNOWN TONGUES PERHAPS SANSCRIT AND CHALDAIC
4766-1814-0024 AND A FEW RARE OLD ENGLISH BOOKS THERE WERE NO PAPERS HOWEVER AND THOSE WERE WHAT HE WAS IN SEARCH OF SO SPYING A DRAWER IN THE TABLE HE PULLED IT HASTILY OPEN
4766-1814-0025 IT WAS FULL OF JEWELS OF INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY AND VALUE STREWN AS CARELESSLY ABOUT AS IF THEY WERE VALUELESS THE BLAZE OF GEMS AT THE MIDNIGHT COURT SEEMED TO HIM AS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE GOLCONDA
4766-1814-0026 THE VALLEY OF DIAMONDS SHOOTING FORTH SPARKS OF RAINBOW FIRE BEFORE HIM NOW AROUND ONE MAGNIFICENT DIAMOND NECKLACE WAS ENTWINED A SCRAP OF PAPER ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN
4766-1814-0027 THAT SETTLED THEIR DESTINY ALL THIS BLAZE OF DIAMONDS RUBIES AND OPALS WERE LEOLINE'S AND WITH THE ENERGETIC RAPIDITY CHARACTERISTIC OF OUR YOUNG FRIEND THAT MORNING HE SWEPT THEM OUT ON THE TABLE
4766-1814-0028 AND RESUMED HIS SEARCH FOR PAPERS NO DOCUMENT WAS THERE TO REWARD HIS SEARCH BUT THE BRIEF ONE TWINED ROUND THE NECKLACE AND HE WAS ABOUT GIVING UP IN DESPAIR WHEN A SMALL BRASS SLIDE IN ONE CORNER CAUGHT HIS EYE
4766-1814-0029 INSTANTLY HE WAS AT IT TRYING IT EVERY WAY SHOVING IT OUT AND IN AND UP AND DOWN UNTIL AT LAST
4766-1814-0030 DISCLOSING AN INNER DRAWER FULL OF PAPERS AND PARCHMENTS
4766-1814-0031 AND NUMEROUS OTHER DOCUMENTS RELATIVE TO HIS WEALTH AND ESTATES THESE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPTS HE ROLLED TOGETHER IN A BUNDLE
4766-1814-0032 AND PLACED CAREFULLY IN HIS DOUBLET AND THEN SEIZING A BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT BRASS CASKET THAT STOOD BENEATH THE TABLE HE SWEPT THE JEWELS IN SECURED IT AND STRAPPED IT TO HIS BELT THIS BRISK AND IMPORTANT LITTLE AFFAIR BEING OVER HE AROSE TO GO
4766-1814-0033 AND IN TURNING SAW THE SKELETON PORTER STANDING IN THE DOOR WAY LOOKING ON IN SPEECHLESS DISMAY IT'S ALL RIGHT MY ANCIENT FRIEND OBSERVED SIR NORMAN GRAVELY THESE PAPERS MUST GO BEFORE THE KING AND THESE JEWELS TO THEIR PROPER OWNER

4766-1814-0042 GEORGE WANTED NO SECOND ORDER BEFORE THE WORDS WERE WELL OUT OF HIS COMPANION'S MOUTH HE WAS DASHING AWAY LIKE A BOLT FROM A BOW AS FURIOUSLY AS IF ON A STEEPLE CHASE WITH SIR NORMAN CLOSE AT HIS HEELS AND THEY RODE
4766-1814-0043 FLUSHED AND BREATHLESS WITH THEIR STEEDS ALL A FOAMING INTO THE COURT YARD OF THE ROYAL PALACE AT WHITEHALL JUST AS THE EARLY RISING SUN WAS SHOWING HIS FLORID AND BURNING VISAGE
4766-1814-0044 THE COURT YARD UNLIKE THE CITY STREETS SWARMED WITH BUSY LIFE PAGES AND ATTENDANTS AND SOLDIERS MOVING HITHER AND THITHER OR LOUNGING ABOUT PREPARING FOR THE MORNING'S JOURNEY TO OXFORD AMONG THE REST
4766-1814-0045 SIR NORMAN OBSERVED HUBERT LYING VERY MUCH AT HIS EASE WRAPPED IN HIS CLOAK ON THE GROUND AND CHATTING LANGUIDLY WITH A PERT AND PRETTY ATTENDANT OF THE FAIR MISTRESS STUART HE CUT SHORT HIS FLIRTATION HOWEVER ABRUPTLY ENOUGH

4766-1814-0060 YOU WOULD PROBABLY OPEN YOUR EYES A TRIFLE AND TAKE IT AS YOU WOULD A NEW CAP OF COURSE I WOULD I HAVEN'T LIVED IN COURTS HALF MY LIFE TO GET UP A SCENE FOR A SMALL MATTER
4766-1814-0061 THAT SHE MUST BE MY SISTER OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND SO YOU FELT NO EMOTION WHATEVER ON HEARING IT I DON'T KNOW AS I PROPERLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY EMOTION SAID HERBERT REFLECTIVELY

4766-1814-0064 BUT THERE WERE TWO MORE MY GOOD YOUNG FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE SAID HUBERT IN A TONE THAT BETRAYED NOT THE SLIGHTEST SYMPTOM OF EMOTION WHO ARE THEY
4766-1814-0065 SIR NORMAN PAUSED ONE INSTANT COMBATING A STRONG TEMPTATION TO SEIZE THE PHLEGMATIC PAGE BY THE COLLAR AND GIVE HIM SUCH ANOTHER SHAKING AS HE WOULD NOT GET OVER FOR A WEEK TO COME
4766-1814-0066 HE MERELY PAUSED TO CAST A WITHERING LOOK UPON HIM AND WALKED ON WELL SAID HUBERT I AM WAITING TO BE TOLD YOU MAY WAIT THEN SAID SIR NORMAN WITH A SMOTHERED GROWL
4766-1814-0067 AND I GIVE YOU JOY WHEN I TELL YOU SUCH EXTRA COMMUNICATIVENESS TO ONE SO STOLID COULD DO NO GOOD BUT I AM NOT STOLID I AM IN A PERFECT AGONY OF ANXIETY SAID HUBERT YOU YOUNG JACKANAPES
