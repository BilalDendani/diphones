2427-154697-0000 BERRY HILL MAY SECOND YOUR LETTER MADAM HAS OPENED A SOURCE OF ANXIETY
2427-154697-0001 AND WHICH TO SEE CLOSED I SCARCELY DARE EXPECT I AM UNWILLING TO OPPOSE MY OPINION TO THAT OF YOUR LADYSHIP NOR INDEED CAN I BUT BY ARGUMENTS WHICH I BELIEVE WILL RATHER RANK ME AS A HERMIT IGNORANT OF THE WORLD
2427-154697-0002 AND FIT ONLY FOR MY CELL THAN AS A PROPER GUARDIAN IN AN AGE SUCH AS THIS FOR AN ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG WOMAN YET THUS CALLED UPON IT BEHOVES ME TO EXPLAIN AND ENDEAVOUR TO VINDICATE THE REASONS BY WHICH I HAVE BEEN HITHERTO GUIDED
2427-154697-0003 THE MOTHER OF THIS DEAR CHILD WHO WAS LED TO DESTRUCTION BY HER OWN IMPRUDENCE THE HARDNESS OF HEART OF MADAME DUVAL AND THE VILLANY OF SIR JOHN BELMONT WAS ONCE WHAT HER DAUGHTER IS NOW
2427-154697-0004 THE BEST BELOVED OF MY HEART AND HER MEMORY SO LONG AS MY OWN HOLDS I SHALL LOVE MOURN AND HONOUR ON THE FATAL DAY THAT HER GENTLE SOUL LEFT ITS MANSION AND NOT MANY HOURS ERE SHE CEASED TO BREATHE
2427-154697-0005 I SOLEMNLY PLIGHTED MY FAITH THAT HER CHILD IF IT LIVED SHOULD KNOW NO FATHER BUT MYSELF OR HER ACKNOWLEDGED HUSBAND YOU CANNOT MADAM SUPPOSE THAT I FOUND MUCH DIFFICULTY IN ADHERING TO THIS PROMISE
2427-154697-0006 AND FORBEARING TO MAKE ANY CLAIM UPON SIR JOHN BELMONT COULD I FEEL AN AFFECTION THE MOST PATERNAL FOR THIS POOR SUFFERER AND NOT ABOMINATE HER DESTROYER COULD I WISH TO DELIVER TO HIM WHO HAD SO BASELY BETRAYED THE MOTHER
2427-154697-0007 THE HELPLESS AND INNOCENT OFFSPRING WHO BORN IN SO MUCH SORROW SEEMED ENTITLED TO ALL THE COMPASSIONATE TENDERNESS OF PITY FOR MANY YEARS THE NAME ALONE OF THAT MAN ACCIDENTALLY SPOKEN IN MY HEARING
2427-154697-0008 ALMOST DIVESTED ME OF MY CHRISTIANITY AND SCARCE COULD I FORBEAR TO EXECRATE HIM YET I SOUGHT NOT NEITHER DID I DESIRE TO DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS CHILD HAD HE WITH ANY APPEARANCE OF CONTRITION OR INDEED OF HUMANITY
2427-154697-0009 ENDEAVOURED TO BECOME LESS UNWORTHY SUCH A BLESSING BUT HE IS A STRANGER TO ALL PARENTAL FEELINGS AND HAS WITH A SAVAGE INSENSIBILITY FORBORNE TO ENQUIRE EVEN INTO THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SWEET ORPHAN THOUGH THE SITUATION OF HIS INJURED WIFE
2427-154697-0010 AND DEMANDING THE JUSTICE WHICH IS HER DUE YET AT OTHER TIMES I HAVE BOTH DISDAINED AND FEARED THE APPLICATION DISDAINED LEST IT SHOULD BE REFUSED AND FEARED LEST IT SHOULD BE ACCEPTED LADY BELMONT
2427-154697-0011 WHO WAS FIRMLY PERSUADED OF HER APPROACHING DISSOLUTION FREQUENTLY AND EARNESTLY BESOUGHT ME THAT IF HER INFANT WAS A FEMALE I WOULD NOT ABANDON HER TO THE DIRECTION OF A MAN SO WHOLLY UNFIT TO TAKE THE CHARGE OF HER EDUCATION
2427-154697-0012 AND OFTEN WOULD SHE SAY SHOULD THE POOR BABE HAVE ANY FEELINGS CORRESPONDENT WITH ITS MOTHER'S IT WILL HAVE NO WANT WHILE UNDER YOUR PROTECTION ALAS SHE HAD NO SOONER QUITTED IT HERSELF THAN SHE WAS PLUNGED INTO A GULPH OF MISERY
2427-154697-0013 I WAS IN A PERPETUAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THE DESIRE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE JUSTICE DONE HER AND THE APPREHENSION THAT WHILE I IMPROVED HER FORTUNE I SHOULD ENDANGER HER MIND HOWEVER AS HER CHARACTER BEGAN TO BE FORMED
2427-154697-0014 AND HER DISPOSITION TO BE DISPLAYED MY PERPLEXITY ABATED THE ROAD BEFORE ME SEEMED LESS THORNY AND INTRICATE AND I THOUGHT I COULD PERCEIVE THE RIGHT PATH FROM THE WRONG FOR WHEN I OBSERVED THE ARTLESS OPENNESS
2427-154697-0015 THE INGENUOUS SIMPLICITY OF HER NATURE WHEN I SAW THAT HER GUILELESS AND INNOCENT SOUL FANCIED ALL THE WORLD TO BE PURE AND DISINTERESTED AS HERSELF AND THAT HER HEART WAS OPEN TO EVERY IMPRESSION
2427-154697-0016 INEVITABLY ENCIRCLING A HOUSE OF WHICH THE MASTER IS DISSIPATED AND UNPRINCIPLED WITHOUT THE GUIDANCE OF A MOTHER OR ANY PRUDENT AND SENSIBLE FEMALE SEEMED TO ME NO LESS THAN SUFFERING HER TO STUMBLE INTO SOME DREADFUL PIT WHEN THE SUN IS IN ITS MERIDIAN
2427-154697-0017 MY PLAN THEREFORE WAS NOT MERELY TO EDUCATE AND TO CHERISH HER AS MY OWN BUT TO ADOPT HER THE HEIRESS OF MY SMALL FORTUNE AND TO BESTOW HER UPON SOME WORTHY MAN WITH WHOM SHE MIGHT SPEND HER DAYS IN TRANQUILITY
2427-154697-0018 BUT ALSO TO JUSTIFY THE CONDUCT WHICH HAS RESULTED FROM THEM IT NOW REMAINS TO SPEAK OF THE TIME TO COME AND HERE INDEED I AM SENSIBLE OF DIFFICULTIES WHICH I ALMOST DESPAIR OF SURMOUNTING ACCORDING TO MY WISHES
2427-154697-0019 WHICH IT IS EXTREMELY PAINFUL TO ME NOT TO CONCUR WITH YET I AM SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR GOODNESS THAT I PRESUME TO HOPE IT WOULD NOT BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO OFFER SUCH ARGUMENTS AS MIGHT LEAD YOU TO THINK WITH ME
2427-154697-0020 THAT THIS YOUNG CREATURE'S CHANCE OF HAPPINESS SEEMS LESS DOUBTFUL IN RETIREMENT THAN IT WOULD BE IN THE GAY AND DISSIPATED WORLD BUT WHY SHOULD I PERPLEX YOUR LADYSHIP WITH REASONING THAT CAN TURN TO SO LITTLE ACCOUNT
2427-154697-0021 WITH ANY PROSPECT OF SUCCESS TO SUCH A WOMAN AS MADAME DUVAL HER CHARACTER AND THE VIOLENCE OF HER DISPOSITION INTIMIDATE ME FROM MAKING THE ATTEMPT SHE IS TOO IGNORANT FOR INSTRUCTION TOO OBSTINATE FOR INTREATY
2427-154697-0022 AND TOO WEAK FOR REASON I WILL NOT THEREFORE ENTER INTO A CONTEST FROM WHICH I HAVE NOTHING TO EXPECT BUT ALTERCATION AND IMPERTINENCE AS SOON WOULD I DISCUSS THE EFFECT OF SOUND WITH THE DEAF
2427-154697-0023 OR THE NATURE OF COLOURS WITH THE BLIND AS AIM AT ILLUMINATING WITH CONVICTION A MIND SO WARPED BY PREJUDICE SO MUCH THE SLAVE OF UNRULY AND ILLIBERAL PASSIONS UNUSED AS SHE IS TO CONTROL PERSUASION WOULD BUT HARDEN
2427-154697-0024 AND OPPOSITION INCENSE HER I YIELD THEREFORE TO THE NECESSITY WHICH COMPELS MY RELUCTANT ACQUIESCENCE AND SHALL NOW TURN ALL MY THOUGHTS UPON CONSIDERING OF SUCH METHODS FOR THE CONDUCTING THIS ENTERPRISE
2427-154697-0025 AS MAY BE MOST CONDUCIVE TO THE HAPPINESS OF MY CHILD AND LEAST LIABLE TO WOUND HER SENSIBILITY THE LAW SUIT THEREFORE I WHOLLY AND ABSOLUTELY DISAPPROVE
2427-154697-0026 WILL YOU MY DEAR MADAM FORGIVE THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD MAN IF I OWN MYSELF GREATLY SURPRISED THAT YOU COULD EVEN FOR A MOMENT LISTEN TO A PLAN SO VIOLENT SO PUBLIC SO TOTALLY REPUGNANT TO ALL FEMALE DELICACY
2427-154697-0027 I AM SATISFIED YOUR LADYSHIP HAS NOT WEIGHED THIS PROJECT THERE WAS A TIME INDEED WHEN TO ASSERT THE INNOCENCE OF LADY BELMONT AND TO BLAZON TO THE WORLD THE WRONGS NOT GUILT BY WHICH SHE SUFFERED
2427-154697-0028 I PROPOSED NAY ATTEMPTED A SIMILAR PLAN BUT THEN ALL ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGEMENT WAS DENIED HOW CRUEL TO THE REMEMBRANCE I BEAR OF HER WOES IS THIS TARDY RESENTMENT OF MADAME DUVAL
2427-154697-0029 SHE WAS DEAF TO THE VOICE OF NATURE THOUGH SHE HAS HEARKENED TO THAT OF AMBITION NEVER CAN I CONSENT TO HAVE THIS DEAR AND TIMID GIRL BROUGHT FORWARD TO THE NOTICE OF THE WORLD BY SUCH A METHOD
2427-154697-0030 A METHOD WHICH WILL SUBJECT HER TO ALL THE IMPERTINENCE OF CURIOSITY THE SNEERS OF CONJECTURE AND THE STINGS OF RIDICULE AND FOR WHAT THE ATTAINMENT OF WEALTH WHICH SHE DOES NOT WANT AND THE GRATIFICATION OF VANITY WHICH SHE DOES NOT FEEL
2427-154697-0031 A CHILD TO APPEAR AGAINST A FATHER NO MADAM OLD AND INFIRM AS I AM I WOULD EVEN YET SOONER CONVEY HER MYSELF TO SOME REMOTE PART OF THE WORLD THOUGH I WERE SURE OF DYING IN THE EXPEDITION
2427-154697-0032 FAR DIFFERENT HAD BEEN THE MOTIVES WHICH WOULD HAVE STIMULATED HER UNHAPPY MOTHER TO SUCH A PROCEEDING ALL HER FELICITY IN THIS WORLD WAS IRRETRIEVABLY LOST HER LIFE WAS BECOME A BURTHEN TO HER AND HER FAIR FAME
2427-154697-0033 WHICH SHE HAD EARLY BEEN TAUGHT TO PRIZE ABOVE ALL OTHER THINGS HAD RECEIVED A MORTAL WOUND THEREFORE TO CLEAR HER OWN HONOUR AND TO SECURE FROM BLEMISH THE BIRTH OF HER CHILD WAS ALL THE GOOD WHICH FORTUNE HAD RESERVED HERSELF THE POWER OF BESTOWING
2427-154697-0034 BUT EVEN THIS LAST CONSOLATION WAS WITHHELD FROM HER LET MILDER MEASURES BE ADOPTED AND SINCE IT MUST BE SO LET APPLICATION BE MADE TO SIR JOHN BELMONT BUT AS TO A LAW SUIT
2427-154697-0035 I HOPE UPON THIS SUBJECT NEVER MORE TO HEAR IT MENTIONED WITH MADAME DUVAL ALL PLEAS OF DELICACY WOULD BE INEFFECTUAL HER SCHEME MUST BE OPPOSED BY ARGUMENTS BETTER SUITED TO HER UNDERSTANDING
2427-154697-0036 I WILL NOT THEREFORE TALK OF ITS IMPROPRIETY BUT ENDEAVOUR TO PROVE ITS INUTILITY HAVE THE GOODNESS THEN TO TELL HER
2427-154697-0037 SINCE SHOULD THE LAWSUIT BE COMMENCED AND EVEN SHOULD THE CAUSE BE GAINED SIR JOHN BELMONT WOULD STILL HAVE IT IN HIS POWER AND IF IRRITATED NO DOUBT IN HIS INCLINATION TO CUT OFF HER GRAND DAUGHTER WITH A SHILLING
2427-154697-0038 THE LONG AND MUTUAL ANIMOSITY BETWEEN HER AND SIR JOHN WILL MAKE HER INTERFERENCE MERELY PRODUCTIVE OF DEBATES AND ILL WILL
2427-154697-0039 THOUGH I WILL WITH UNWEARIED ZEAL DEVOTE ALL MY THOUGHTS TO GIVING COUNSEL BUT IN TRUTH I HAVE NEITHER INCLINATION NOR SPIRITS ADEQUATE TO ENGAGING PERSONALLY WITH THIS MAN
2427-154697-0040 MY OPINION IS THAT HE WOULD PAY MORE RESPECT TO A LETTER FROM YOUR LADYSHIP UPON THIS SUBJECT THAN FROM ANY OTHER PERSON I THEREFORE ADVISE AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL YOURSELF TAKE THE TROUBLE OF WRITING TO HIM IN ORDER TO OPEN THE AFFAIR
2427-154697-0041 I HAVE FOR HIM A POSTHUMOUS LETTER
2427-154697-0042 IF EVER SUCH A MEETING SHOULD TAKE PLACE THE VIEWS OF THE BRANGHTONS IN SUGGESTING THIS SCHEME ARE OBVIOUSLY INTERESTED
2427-154697-0043 TO INDUCE MADAME DUVAL TO SETTLE HER OWN UPON THEMSELVES IN THIS HOWEVER THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE MISTAKEN FOR LITTLE MINDS HAVE EVER A PROPENSITY TO BESTOW THEIR WEALTH UPON THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY IN AFFLUENCE AND THEREFORE
2427-154697-0044 THAT HER CHILD SHOULD NEVER BE OWNED BUT WITH HER SELF MUST BE INVIOLABLY ADHERED TO I AM DEAR MADAM WITH GREAT RESPECT YOUR LADYSHIP'S MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT
