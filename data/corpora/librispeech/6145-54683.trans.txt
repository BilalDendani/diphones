6145-54683-0000 THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION DID NOT ARRIVE TILL LATE IN THE DAY AND WAS IN THE NEGATIVE MISTER SHERWIN HAD NOT FOUND HIS DAUGHTER SHE HAD LEFT THE HOSPITAL BEFORE HE GOT THERE AND NO ONE COULD TELL HIM WHITHER SHE HAD GONE HIS LANGUAGE AND MANNER AS HE HIMSELF ADMITTED
6145-54683-0001 HAD BEEN SO VIOLENT THAT HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER THE WARD WHERE MANNION LAY WHEN HE RETURNED HOME HE FOUND HIS WIFE AT THE POINT OF DEATH AND ON THE SAME EVENING SHE EXPIRED
6145-54683-0002 HE ONLY MENTIONED HIS DAUGHTER TO DECLARE IN TERMS ALMOST OF FURY THAT HE WOULD ACCUSE HER BEFORE HIS WIFE'S SURVIVING RELATIVES OF HAVING BEEN THE CAUSE OF HER MOTHER'S DEATH AND CALLED DOWN THE MOST TERRIBLE DENUNCIATIONS ON HIS OWN HEAD IF HE EVER SPOKE TO HIS CHILD AGAIN
6145-54683-0003 THOUGH HE SHOULD SEE HER STARVING BEFORE HIM IN THE STREETS IN A POSTSCRIPT RALPH INFORMED ME THAT HE WOULD CALL THE NEXT MORNING AND CONCERT MEASURES FOR TRACKING SHERWIN'S DAUGHTER TO HER PRESENT RETREAT EVERY SENTENCE IN THIS LETTER BORE WARNING OF THE CRISIS WHICH WAS NOW CLOSE AT HAND
6145-54683-0004 YET I HAD AS LITTLE OF THE DESIRE AS OF THE POWER TO PREPARE FOR IT A SUPERSTITIOUS CONVICTION THAT MY ACTIONS WERE GOVERNED BY A FATALITY WHICH NO HUMAN FORESIGHT COULD ALTER OR AVOID BEGAN TO STRENGTHEN WITHIN ME
6145-54683-0005 FROM THIS TIME FORTH I AWAITED EVENTS WITH THE UNINQUIRING PATIENCE THE HELPLESS RESIGNATION OF DESPAIR MY BROTHER CAME PUNCTUAL TO HIS APPOINTMENT WHEN HE PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD AT ONCE ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE HOSPITAL I NEVER HESITATED AT DOING AS HE DESIRED
6145-54683-0006 WE REACHED OUR DESTINATION AND RALPH APPROACHED THE GATES TO MAKE HIS FIRST ENQUIRIES HE WAS STILL SPEAKING TO THE PORTER WHEN A GENTLEMAN ADVANCED TOWARDS THEM ON HIS WAY OUT OF THE HOSPITAL I SAW HIM RECOGNISE MY BROTHER AND HEARD RALPH EXCLAIM BERNARD
6145-54683-0007 WHY NOT WAS THE ANSWER I GOT EVERY SURGICAL TESTIMONIAL THE HOTEL DIEU COULD GIVE ME SIX MONTHS AGO AND COULDN'T AFFORD TO STAY IN PARIS ONLY FOR MY PLEASURE DO YOU REMEMBER CALLING ME A MUTE INGLORIOUS LISTON LONG AGO WHEN WE LAST MET WELL
6145-54683-0008 AND BLAZE INTO A SHINING LIGHT OF THE PROFESSION PLENTY OF PRACTICE AT THE HOSPITAL HERE VERY LITTLE ANYWHERE ELSE I AM SORRY TO SAY YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU BELONG TO THIS HOSPITAL MY DEAR FELLOW I AM REGULARLY ON THE STAFF I'M HERE EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE
6145-54683-0009 YOU'RE THE VERY MAN TO ENLIGHTEN US HERE BASIL CROSS OVER AND LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO AN OLD PARIS FRIEND OF MINE MISTER BERNARD MY BROTHER YOU'VE OFTEN HEARD ME TALK BASIL OF A YOUNGER SON OF OLD SIR WILLIAM BERNARD'S WHO PREFERRED A CURE OF BODIES TO A CURE OF SOULS
6145-54683-0010 AND ACTUALLY INSISTED ON WORKING IN A HOSPITAL WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE IDLED IN A FAMILY LIVING THIS IS THE MAN THE BEST OF DOCTORS AND GOOD FELLOWS ARE YOU BRINGING YOUR BROTHER TO THE HOSPITAL TO FOLLOW MY MAD EXAMPLE ASKED MISTER BERNARD AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME NOT EXACTLY JACK
6145-54683-0011 BUT WE REALLY HAVE AN OBJECT IN COMING HERE CAN YOU GIVE US TEN MINUTES TALK SOMEWHERE IN PRIVATE WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS HE LED US INTO AN EMPTY ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE BUILDING LEAVE THE MATTER IN MY HANDS WHISPERED RALPH TO ME AS WE SAT DOWN I'LL FIND OUT EVERYTHING
6145-54683-0012 NOW BERNARD HE SAID YOU HAVE A MAN HERE WHO CALLS HIMSELF MISTER TURNER ARE YOU A FRIEND OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PATIENT WONDERFUL THE STUDENTS CALL HIM THE GREAT MYSTERY OF LONDON
6145-54683-0013 AND WHICH I AM SURE YOU WON'T INQUIRE INTO WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IT IS OUR INTEREST TO KEEP THEM SECRET
6145-54683-0014 THEN WITHOUT ANY MORE WORDS ABOUT IT OUR OBJECT HERE TO DAY IS TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING WE CAN ABOUT MISTER TURNER
6145-54683-0015 DID A WOMAN COME THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY YES AND BEHAVED RATHER ODDLY I BELIEVE I WAS NOT HERE WHEN SHE CAME BUT WAS TOLD SHE ASKED FOR TURNER IN A VERY AGITATED MANNER SHE WAS DIRECTED TO THE VICTORIA WARD WHERE HE IS
6145-54683-0016 AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE LOOKED EXCESSIVELY FLURRIED AND EXCITED SEEING THE WARD QUITE FULL AND PERHAPS NOT BEING USED TO HOSPITALS HOWEVER IT WAS THOUGH THE NURSE POINTED OUT THE RIGHT BED TO HER SHE RAN IN A MIGHTY HURRY TO THE WRONG ONE I UNDERSTAND SAID RALPH
6145-54683-0017 THE NURSE WAS AT HER SIDE AND LED HER TO THE RIGHT BED THERE I'M TOLD ANOTHER SCENE HAPPENED AT SIGHT OF THE PATIENT'S FACE WHICH IS VERY FRIGHTFULLY DISFIGURED SHE WAS ON THE POINT AS THE NURSE THOUGHT OF GOING INTO A FIT BUT TURNER STOPPED HER IN AN INSTANT
6145-54683-0018 HE JUST LAID HIS HAND ON HER ARM AND WHISPERED SOMETHING TO HER AND THOUGH SHE TURNED AS PALE AS ASHES SHE WAS QUIET DIRECTLY THE NEXT THING THEY SAY HE DID WAS TO GIVE HER A SLIP OF PAPER COOLLY DIRECTING HER TO GO TO THE ADDRESS WRITTEN ON IT
6145-54683-0019 AND TO COME BACK TO THE HOSPITAL AGAIN AS SOON AS SHE COULD SHOW A LITTLE MORE RESOLUTION
6145-54683-0020 HAS NOBODY ASKED WHERE YES A FELLOW WHO SAID HE WAS HER FATHER AND WHO BEHAVED LIKE A MADMAN HE CAME HERE ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD LEFT AND WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HER HOW THE DEUCE SHOULD WE KNOW ANYTHING HE THREATENED TURNER
6145-54683-0021 WHOM BY THE BYE HE CALLED MANNING OR SOME SUCH NAME IN SUCH AN OUTRAGEOUS MANNER
6145-54683-0022 YOU FIND THE ROOM RATHER CLOSE NO INDEED NOT AT ALL I HAVE JUST RECOVERED FROM A SERIOUS ILLNESS BUT PRAY GO ON I HAVE VERY LITTLE MORE TO SAY THE FATHER WENT AWAY IN A FURY JUST AS HE CAME THE DAUGHTER HAS NOT YET MADE HER APPEARANCE A SECOND TIME
6145-54683-0023 SHE MUST IF SHE WANTS TO SEE TURNER HE WON'T BE OUT I SUSPECT FOR ANOTHER FORTNIGHT HE HAS BEEN MAKING HIMSELF WORSE BY PERPETUALLY WRITING LETTERS WE WERE RATHER AFRAID OF ERYSIPELAS BUT HE'LL GET OVER THAT DANGER I THINK
6145-54683-0024 ABOUT THE WOMAN SAID RALPH IT IS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE THAT WE SHOULD KNOW WHERE SHE IS NOW LIVING IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY WE WILL PAY WELL FOR IT OF GETTING SOME SHARP FELLOW TO FOLLOW HER HOME FROM THIS PLACE THE NEXT TIME SHE COMES HERE
6145-54683-0025 MISTER BERNARD HESITATED A MOMENT AND CONSIDERED I THINK I CAN MANAGE IT FOR YOU WITH THE PORTER AFTER YOU ARE GONE HE SAID PROVIDED YOU LEAVE ME FREE TO GIVE ANY REMUNERATION I MAY THINK NECESSARY
6145-54683-0026 HAVE YOU GOT PEN AND INK I'LL WRITE DOWN MY BROTHER'S ADDRESS YOU CAN COMMUNICATE RESULTS TO HIM AS SOON AS THEY OCCUR WHILE MISTER BERNARD WENT TO THE OPPOSITE END OF THE ROOM IN SEARCH OF WRITING MATERIALS RALPH WHISPERED TO ME IF HE WROTE TO MY ADDRESS MISSUS RALPH MIGHT SEE THE LETTER
6145-54683-0027 SHE IS THE MOST AMIABLE OF HER SEX BUT IF WRITTEN INFORMATION OF A WOMAN'S RESIDENCE DIRECTED TO ME FELL INTO HER HANDS YOU UNDERSTAND BASIL BESIDES IT WILL BE EASY TO LET ME KNOW THE MOMENT YOU HEAR FROM JACK LOOK UP YOUNG ONE IT'S ALL RIGHT WE ARE SAILING WITH WIND AND TIDE
6145-54683-0028 HERE MISTER BERNARD BROUGHT US PEN AND INK WHILE RALPH WAS WRITING MY ADDRESS HIS FRIEND SAID TO ME I HOPE YOU WILL NOT SUSPECT ME OF WISHING TO INTRUDE ON YOUR SECRETS IF ASSUMING YOUR INTEREST IN TURNER TO BE THE REVERSE OF A FRIENDLY INTEREST
6145-54683-0029 I WARN YOU TO LOOK SHARPLY AFTER HIM WHEN HE LEAVES THE HOSPITAL EITHER THERE HAS BEEN MADNESS IN HIS FAMILY OR HIS BRAIN HAS SUFFERED FROM HIS EXTERNAL INJURIES LEGALLY HE MAY BE QUITE FIT TO BE AT LARGE
6145-54683-0030 FOR HE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE APPEARANCE OF PERFECT SELF POSSESSION IN ALL THE ORDINARY AFFAIRS OF LIFE BUT MORALLY I AM CONVINCED THAT HE IS A DANGEROUS MONOMANIAC HIS MANIA BEING CONNECTED WITH SOME FIXED IDEA WHICH EVIDENTLY NEVER LEAVES HIM DAY OR NIGHT
6145-54683-0031 I WOULD LAY A HEAVY WAGER THAT HE DIES IN A PRISON OR A MADHOUSE AND I'LL LAY ANOTHER WAGER IF HE'S MAD ENOUGH TO ANNOY US THAT WE ARE THE PEOPLE TO SHUT HIM UP SAID RALPH THERE IS THE ADDRESS AND NOW WE NEEDN'T WASTE YOUR TIME ANY LONGER
6145-54683-0032 I HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE PLACE AT BROMPTON JACK YOU AND BASIL MUST COME AND DINE WITH ME AS SOON AS THE CARPETS ARE DOWN WE LEFT THE ROOM AS WE CROSSED THE HALL A GENTLEMAN CAME FORWARD AND SPOKE TO MISTER BERNARD THAT MAN'S FEVER IN THE VICTORIA WARD HAS DECLARED ITSELF AT LAST HE SAID
6145-54683-0033 AND WHAT DO THEY INDICATE TYPHUS OF THE MOST MALIGNANT CHARACTER NOT A DOUBT OF IT COME UP AND LOOK AT HIM I SAW MISTER BERNARD START AND GLANCE QUICKLY AT MY BROTHER RALPH FIXED HIS EYES SEARCHINGLY ON HIS FRIEND'S FACE EXCLAIMED
6145-54683-0034 VICTORIA WARD WHY YOU MENTIONED THAT
6145-54683-0035 THE NEXT MOMENT HE DREW MISTER BERNARD ASIDE SAYING I WANT TO ASK YOU WHETHER THE BED IN VICTORIA WARD OCCUPIED BY THIS MAN WHOSE FEVER HAS TURNED TO TYPHUS
6145-54683-0036 AFTER TALKING TOGETHER IN WHISPERS FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEY REJOINED ME MISTER BERNARD WAS EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENT THEORIES OF INFECTION TO RALPH MY NOTION HE SAID IS THAT INFECTION IS TAKEN THROUGH THE LUNGS
6145-54683-0037 ONE BREATH INHALED FROM THE INFECTED ATMOSPHERE HANGING IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE DISEASED PERSON AND GENERALLY EXTENDING ABOUT A FOOT FROM HIM BEING ENOUGH TO COMMUNICATE HIS MALADY TO THE BREATHER PROVIDED THERE EXISTS AT THE TIME IN THE INDIVIDUAL EXPOSED TO CATCH THE MALADY
6145-54683-0038 A CONSTITUTIONAL PREDISPOSITION TO INFECTION THIS PREDISPOSITION WE KNOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED BY MENTAL AGITATION OR BODILY WEAKNESS BUT IN THE CASE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING OF HE LOOKED AT ME THE CHANCES OF INFECTION OR NON INFECTION MAY BE EQUALLY BALANCED
6145-54683-0039 AT ANY RATE I CAN PREDICT NOTHING ABOUT THEM AT THIS STAGE OF THE DISCOVERY YOU WILL WRITE THE MOMENT YOU HEAR ANYTHING SAID RALPH SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM THE VERY MOMENT I HAVE YOUR BROTHER'S ADDRESS SAFE IN MY POCKET WE SEPARATED
6145-54683-0040 RALPH WAS UNUSUALLY SILENT AND SERIOUS ON OUR WAY BACK HE TOOK LEAVE OF ME AT THE DOOR OF MY LODGING VERY ABRUPTLY WITHOUT REFERRING AGAIN TO OUR VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL A WEEK PASSED AWAY AND I HEARD NOTHING FROM MISTER BERNARD DURING THIS INTERVAL I SAW LITTLE OF MY BROTHER
6145-54683-0041 HE WAS OCCUPIED IN MOVING INTO HIS NEW HOUSE TOWARDS THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK HE CAME TO INFORM ME THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE LONDON FOR A FEW DAYS
6145-54683-0042 ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF THE ESTATES RALPH STILL RETAINED ALL HIS OLD DISLIKE OF THE STEWARD'S ACCOUNTS AND THE LAWYER'S CONSULTATIONS
6145-54683-0043 AND GO TO THE COUNTRY AS HE WAS DESIRED HE DID NOT EXPECT TO BE ABSENT MORE THAN TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT EARNESTLY CHARGED ME TO WRITE TO HIM IF I HAD ANY NEWS FROM THE HOSPITAL WHILE HE WAS AWAY DURING THE WEEK CLARA CAME TWICE TO SEE ME ESCAPING FROM HOME BY STEALTH AS BEFORE
6145-54683-0044 AND TO SUSTAIN ME IN HOPE I SAW WITH A SORROW AND APPREHENSION WHICH I COULD NOT ALTOGETHER CONCEAL FROM HER THAT THE WEARY LOOK IN HER FACE HAD NEVER CHANGED NEVER DIMINISHED SINCE I HAD FIRST OBSERVED IT
6145-54683-0045 RALPH HAD FROM MOTIVES OF DELICACY AVOIDED INCREASING THE HIDDEN ANXIETIES WHICH WERE BUT TOO EVIDENTLY PREYING UPON HER HEALTH BY KEEPING HER IN PERFECT IGNORANCE OF OUR VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL AND INDEED OF THE PARTICULARS OF ALL OUR PROCEEDINGS SINCE HIS RETURN
6145-54683-0046 I TOOK CARE TO PRESERVE THE SAME SECRECY DURING HER SHORT INTERVIEWS WITH ME SHE BADE ME FAREWELL AFTER HER THIRD VISIT WITH A SADNESS WHICH SHE VAINLY ENDEAVOURED TO HIDE
6145-54683-0047 I LITTLE THOUGHT THEN THAT THE TONES OF HER SWEET CLEAR VOICE HAD FALLEN ON MY EAR FOR THE LAST TIME BEFORE I WANDERED TO THE FAR WEST OF ENGLAND WHERE I NOW WRITE AT THE END OF THE WEEK IT WAS ON A SATURDAY I REMEMBER I LEFT MY LODGINGS EARLY IN THE MORNING TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY
6145-54683-0048 WITH NO INTENTION OF RETURNING BEFORE EVENING I HAD FELT A SENSE OF OPPRESSION ON RISING WHICH WAS ALMOST UNENDURABLE THE PERSPIRATION STOOD THICK ON MY FOREHEAD THOUGH THE DAY WAS NOT UNUSUALLY HOT THE AIR OF LONDON GREW HARDER AND HARDER TO BREATHE WITH EVERY MINUTE
6145-54683-0049 MY HEART FELT TIGHTENED TO BURSTING MY TEMPLES THROBBED WITH FEVER FURY MY VERY LIFE SEEMED TO DEPEND ON ESCAPING INTO PURE AIR INTO SOME PLACE WHERE THERE WAS SHADE FROM TREES AND WATER THAT RAN COOL AND REFRESHING TO LOOK ON SO I SET FORTH
6145-54683-0050 EVENING WAS CHANGING INTO NIGHT AS I GOT BACK TO LONDON I INQUIRED OF THE SERVANT AT MY LODGING WHEN SHE LET ME IN WHETHER ANY LETTER HAD ARRIVED FOR ME
6145-54683-0051 I EAGERLY OPENED THE LETTER AND READ THESE WORDS PRIVATE FRIDAY MY DEAR SIR ON THE ENCLOSED SLIP OF PAPER YOU WILL FIND THE ADDRESS OF THE YOUNG WOMAN OF WHOM YOUR BROTHER SPOKE TO ME WHEN WE MET AT THE HOSPITAL I REGRET TO SAY
6145-54683-0052 THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH I HAVE OBTAINED INFORMATION OF HER RESIDENCE ARE OF THE MOST MELANCHOLY NATURE
6145-54683-0053 WHO BEGGED THAT I WOULD VISIT HER PROFESSIONALLY AS HE HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN THE MEDICAL MAN WHO WAS THEN IN ATTENDANCE ON HER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES COMBINED TO MAKE MY COMPLIANCE WITH HIS REQUEST ANYTHING BUT EASY OR DESIRABLE BUT KNOWING THAT YOU OR YOUR BROTHER I OUGHT PERHAPS RATHER TO SAY
6145-54683-0054 WERE INTERESTED IN THE YOUNG WOMAN I DETERMINED TO TAKE THE VERY EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING HER AND CONSULTING WITH HER MEDICAL ATTENDANT
6145-54683-0055 WHEN I ARRIVED I FOUND HER SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THE WORST ATTACKS OF TYPHUS I EVER REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN AND I THINK IT MY DUTY TO STATE CANDIDLY THAT I BELIEVE HER LIFE TO BE IN IMMINENT DANGER AT THE SAME TIME IT IS RIGHT TO INFORM YOU THAT THE GENTLEMAN IN ATTENDANCE ON HER DOES NOT SHARE MY OPINION
6145-54683-0056 HE STILL THINKS THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE OF SAVING HER THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT SHE WAS INFECTED WITH TYPHUS AT THE HOSPITAL
6145-54683-0057 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE WARD AND HOW SHE RAN TO THE WRONG BED BEFORE THE NURSE COULD STOP HER THE MAN WHOM SHE THUS MISTOOK FOR TURNER WAS SUFFERING FROM FEVER WHICH HAD NOT THEN SPECIFICALLY DECLARED ITSELF BUT WHICH DID SO DECLARE ITSELF AS A TYPHUS FEVER
6145-54683-0058 ON THE MORNING WHEN YOU AND YOUR BROTHER CAME TO THE HOSPITAL THIS MAN'S DISORDER MUST HAVE BEEN INFECTIOUS WHEN THE YOUNG WOMAN STOOPED DOWN CLOSE OVER HIM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS THE PERSON SHE HAD COME TO SEE ALTHOUGH SHE STARTED BACK AT ONCE ON DISCOVERING HER MISTAKE SHE HAD BREATHED THE INFECTION INTO HER SYSTEM
6145-54683-0059 AS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD BY SOME PHYSICAL WEAKNESS
6145-54683-0060 SINCE THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF HER DISEASE APPEARED ON SATURDAY LAST I CANNOT FIND THAT ANY ERROR HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN THE MEDICAL TREATMENT AS REPORTED TO ME I REMAINED SOME TIME BY HER BEDSIDE TO DAY OBSERVING HER
6145-54683-0061 THE DELIRIUM WHICH IS MORE OR LESS AN INVARIABLE RESULT OF TYPHUS IS PARTICULARLY MARKED IN HER CASE AND MANIFESTS ITSELF BOTH BY SPEECH AND GESTURE IT HAS BEEN FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO QUIET HER BY ANY MEANS HITHERTO TRIED
6145-54683-0062 WHILE I WAS WATCHING BY HER SHE NEVER CEASED CALLING ON YOUR NAME AND ENTREATING TO SEE YOU
6145-54683-0063 OCCASIONALLY SHE MIXES OTHER NAMES WITH YOURS AND MENTIONS THEM IN TERMS OF ABHORRENCE BUT HER PERSISTENCY IN CALLING FOR YOUR PRESENCE IS SO REMARKABLE THAT I AM TEMPTED MERELY FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD MYSELF TO SUGGEST THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD GO TO HER
6145-54683-0064 ON THE BARE CHANCE THAT YOU MIGHT EXERCISE SOME TRANQUILLISING INFLUENCE AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU FEAR INFECTION OR FOR ANY PRIVATE REASONS INTO WHICH I HAVE NEITHER THE RIGHT NOR THE WISH TO INQUIRE FEEL UNWILLING TO TAKE THE COURSE I HAVE POINTED OUT
6145-54683-0065 I CAN CONSCIENTIOUSLY ASSURE YOU THAT DUTY IS NOT INVOLVED IN IT I HAVE HOWEVER ANOTHER SUGGESTION TO MAKE WHICH IS OF A POSITIVE NATURE AND WHICH I AM SURE WILL MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL IT IS THAT HER PARENTS OR SOME OF HER OTHER RELATIONS IF HER PARENTS ARE NOT ALIVE
6145-54683-0066 SHOULD BE INFORMED OF HER SITUATION POSSIBLY YOU MAY KNOW SOMETHING OF HER CONNECTIONS AND CAN THEREFORE DO THIS GOOD OFFICE SHE IS DYING IN A STRANGE PLACE AMONG PEOPLE WHO AVOID HER AS THEY WOULD AVOID A PESTILENCE
6145-54683-0067 I SHALL VISIT HER TWICE TO MORROW IN THE MORNING AND AT NIGHT IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO RISK SEEING HER AND I REPEAT THAT IT IS IN NO SENSE IMPERATIVE THAT YOU SHOULD COMBAT SUCH UNWILLINGNESS PERHAPS YOU WILL COMMUNICATE WITH ME AT MY PRIVATE ADDRESS I REMAIN DEAR SIR
6145-54683-0068 FAITHFULLY YOURS JOHN BERNARD P S I OPEN MY LETTER AGAIN TO INFORM YOU THAT TURNER ACTING AGAINST ALL ADVICE HAS LEFT THE HOSPITAL TO DAY
6145-54683-0069 HE ATTEMPTED TO GO ON TUESDAY LAST WHEN I BELIEVE HE FIRST RECEIVED INFORMATION OF THE YOUNG WOMAN'S SERIOUS ILLNESS BUT WAS SEIZED WITH A VIOLENT ATTACK OF GIDDINESS ON ATTEMPTING TO WALK AND FELL DOWN JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF THE WARD
