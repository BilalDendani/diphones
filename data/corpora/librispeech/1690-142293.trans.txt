1690-142293-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN ANGEL VISITS AS ANGELS IN SOME BRIGHTER DREAMS CALL TO THE SOUL WHEN MAN DOTH SLEEP SO SOME STRANGE THOUGHTS TRANSCEND OUR WONTED THEMES AND INTO GLORY PEEP HENRY VAUGHAN
1690-142293-0001 MISSUS HALE WAS CURIOUSLY AMUSED AND INTERESTED BY THE IDEA OF THE THORNTON DINNER PARTY SHE KEPT WONDERING ABOUT THE DETAILS WITH SOMETHING OF THE SIMPLICITY OF A LITTLE CHILD WHO WANTS TO HAVE ALL ITS ANTICIPATED PLEASURES
1690-142293-0002 DESCRIBED BEFOREHAND BUT THE MONOTONOUS LIFE LED BY INVALIDS OFTEN MAKES THEM LIKE CHILDREN INASMUCH AS THEY HAVE NEITHER OF THEM ANY SENSE OF PROPORTION IN EVENTS AND SEEM EACH TO BELIEVE THAT THE WALLS AND CURTAINS WHICH SHUT IN THEIR WORLD
1690-142293-0003 AND SHUT OUT EVERYTHING ELSE MUST OF NECESSITY BE LARGER THAN ANYTHING HIDDEN BEYOND BESIDES MISSUS HALE HAD HAD HER VANITIES AS A GIRL HAD PERHAPS UNDULY FELT THEIR MORTIFICATION WHEN SHE BECAME A POOR CLERGYMAN'S WIFE
1690-142293-0004 THEY HAD BEEN SMOTHERED AND KEPT DOWN BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTINCT AND SHE LIKED TO THINK OF SEEING MARGARET DRESSED FOR A PARTY AND DISCUSSED WHAT SHE SHOULD WEAR WITH AN UNSETTLED ANXIETY THAT AMUSED MARGARET WHO HAD BEEN MORE ACCUSTOMED TO SOCIETY
1690-142293-0005 THAN HER MOTHER IN FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS OF HELSTONE THEN
1690-142293-0006 ARE YOU SURE IT WILL FIT
1690-142293-0007 OH YES MAMMA MISSUS MURRAY MADE IT AND IT'S SURE TO BE RIGHT IT MAY BE A STRAW'S BREADTH SHORTER OR LONGER WAISTED ACCORDING TO MY HAVING GROWN FAT OR THIN BUT I DON'T THINK I'VE ALTERED IN THE LEAST
1690-142293-0008 HADN'T YOU BETTER LET DIXON SEE IT IT MAY HAVE GONE YELLOW WITH LYING BY IF YOU LIKE MAMMA BUT IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST I'VE A VERY NICE PINK GAUZE WHICH AUNT SHAW GAVE ME ONLY TWO OR THREE MONTHS BEFORE EDITH WAS MARRIED
1690-142293-0009 THAT CAN'T HAVE GONE YELLOW NO BUT IT MAY HAVE FADED WELL THEN I'VE A GREEN SILK I FEEL MORE AS IF IT WAS THE EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES
1690-142293-0010 I WISH I KNEW WHAT YOU OUGHT TO WEAR SAID MISSUS HALE NERVOUSLY MARGARET'S MANNER CHANGED INSTANTLY SHALL I GO AND PUT THEM ON ONE AFTER ANOTHER MAMMA AND THEN YOU COULD SEE WHICH YOU LIKED BEST
1690-142293-0011 BUT YES PERHAPS THAT WILL BE BEST SO OFF MARGARET WENT SHE WAS VERY MUCH INCLINED TO PLAY SOME PRANKS WHEN SHE WAS DRESSED UP AT SUCH AN UNUSUAL HOUR
1690-142293-0012 TO MAKE HER RICH WHITE SILK BALLOON OUT INTO A CHEESE TO RETREAT BACKWARDS FROM HER MOTHER AS IF SHE WERE THE QUEEN BUT WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THESE FREAKS OF HERS WERE REGARDED AS INTERRUPTIONS TO THE SERIOUS BUSINESS AND AS SUCH ANNOYED HER MOTHER
1690-142293-0013 SHE BECAME GRAVE AND SEDATE WHAT HAD POSSESSED THE WORLD HER WORLD TO FIDGET SO ABOUT HER DRESS SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND BUT THAT VERY AFTER NOON ON NAMING HER ENGAGEMENT TO BESSY HIGGINS

1690-142293-0047 IF THEY DON'T MAKE THE MASTERS GIVE EM THEIR SHARE
1690-142293-0048 THE WAY THEY KEEP ON GRINNING AND FIGHTING AT EACH OTHER TILL EVEN WHILE THEY FIGHT THEY ARE PICKED OFF INTO THE PIT JUST THEN NICHOLAS HIGGINS CAME IN HE CAUGHT HIS DAUGHTER'S LAST WORDS AY
1690-142293-0049 AND I'LL FIGHT ON TOO AND I'LL GET IT THIS TIME IT'LL NOT TAKE LONG FOR TO MAKE EM GIVE IN FOR THEY'VE GETTEN A PRETTY LOT OF ORDERS ALL UNDER CONTRACT AND THEY'LL SOON FIND OUT THEY'D BETTER GIVE US OUR FIVE PER CENT THAN LOSE THE PROFIT THEY'LL GAIN
1690-142293-0050 MY MASTERS I KNOW WHO'LL WIN MARGARET FANCIED FROM HIS MANNER THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DRINKING
1690-142293-0051 AND SHE WAS RATHER CONFIRMED IN THIS IDEA BY THE EVIDENT ANXIETY BESSY SHOWED TO HASTEN HER DEPARTURE BESSY SAID TO HER THE TWENTY FIRST THAT'S THURSDAY WEEK
1690-142293-0052 BEFORE MARGARET COULD ANSWER HIGGINS BROKE OUT THORNTON'S AR T GOING TO DINE AT THORNTON'S

1690-142293-0056 I SHOULD LIKE TO GET SPEECH O THEM WHEN THEY'RE A BIT INCLINED TO SIT STILL AFTER DINNER
1690-142293-0057 GOOD BYE SAID MARGARET HASTILY GOOD BYE BESSY I SHALL LOOK TO SEE YOU ON THE TWENTY FIRST IF YOU'RE WELL ENOUGH THE MEDICINES AND TREATMENT WHICH DOCTOR DONALDSON HAD ORDERED FOR MISSUS HALE
1690-142293-0058 DID HER SO MUCH GOOD AT FIRST THAT NOT ONLY SHE HERSELF BUT MARGARET BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AND THAT SHE COULD RECOVER PERMANENTLY AS FOR MISTER HALE
1690-142293-0059 ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER HAD AN IDEA OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THEIR APPREHENSIONS HE TRIUMPHED OVER THEIR FEARS WITH AN EVIDENT RELIEF WHICH PROVED HOW MUCH HIS GLIMPSE INTO THE NATURE OF THEM HAD AFFECTED HIM
1690-142293-0060 ONLY DIXON CROAKED FOR EVER INTO MARGARET'S EAR HOWEVER MARGARET DEFIED THE RAVEN AND WOULD HOPE THEY NEEDED THIS GLEAM OF BRIGHTNESS IN DOORS FOR OUT OF DOORS
1690-142293-0061 EVEN TO THEIR UNINSTRUCTED EYES THERE WAS A GLOOMY BROODING APPEARANCE OF DISCONTENT MISTER HALE HAD HIS OWN ACQUAINTANCES AMONG THE WORKING MEN AND WAS DEPRESSED WITH THEIR EARNESTLY TOLD TALES OF SUFFERING AND LONG ENDURANCE
1690-142293-0062 FROM HIS POSITION HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT WITHOUT THEIR WORDS BUT HERE WAS THIS MAN FROM A DISTANT COUNTY WHO WAS PERPLEXED BY THE WORKINGS OF THE SYSTEM
1690-142293-0063 AND EACH WAS EAGER TO MAKE HIM A JUDGE AND TO BRING WITNESS OF HIS OWN CAUSES FOR IRRITATION THEN MISTER HALE BROUGHT ALL HIS BUDGET OF GRIEVANCES AND LAID IT BEFORE MISTER THORNTON FOR HIM WITH HIS EXPERIENCE AS A MASTER
1690-142293-0064 TO ARRANGE THEM AND EXPLAIN THEIR ORIGIN WHICH HE ALWAYS DID ON SOUND ECONOMICAL PRINCIPLES SHOWING THAT AS TRADE WAS CONDUCTED THERE MUST ALWAYS BE A WAXING AND WANING OF COMMERCIAL PROSPERITY AND THAT IN THE WANING
1690-142293-0065 A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MASTERS AS WELL AS OF MEN MUST GO DOWN INTO RUIN AND BE NO MORE SEEN AMONG THE RANKS OF THE HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS HE SPOKE AS IF THIS CONSEQUENCE WERE SO ENTIRELY LOGICAL
1690-142293-0066 THAT NEITHER EMPLOYERS NOR EMPLOYED HAD ANY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN IF IT BECAME THEIR FATE THE EMPLOYER TO TURN ASIDE FROM THE RACE HE COULD NO LONGER RUN WITH A BITTER SENSE OF INCOMPETENCY AND FAILURE WOUNDED IN THE STRUGGLE
1690-142293-0067 TRAMPLED DOWN BY HIS FELLOWS IN THEIR HASTE TO GET RICH SLIGHTED WHERE HE ONCE WAS HONOURED HUMBLY ASKING FOR INSTEAD OF BESTOWING EMPLOYMENT WITH A LORDLY HAND OF COURSE SPEAKING SO OF THE FATE THAT AS A MASTER
1690-142293-0068 MIGHT BE HIS OWN IN THE FLUCTUATIONS OF COMMERCE HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE MORE SYMPATHY WITH THAT OF THE WORKMEN WHO WERE PASSED BY IN THE SWIFT MERCILESS IMPROVEMENT OR ALTERATION WHO WOULD FAIN LIE DOWN AND QUIETLY DIE OUT OF THE WORLD THAT NEEDED THEM NOT
1690-142293-0069 BUT FELT AS IF THEY COULD NEVER REST IN THEIR GRAVES FOR THE CLINGING CRIES OF THE BELOVED AND HELPLESS THEY WOULD LEAVE BEHIND WHO ENVIED THE POWER OF THE WILD BIRD THAT CAN FEED HER YOUNG WITH HER VERY HEART'S BLOOD
1690-142293-0070 MARGARET'S WHOLE SOUL ROSE UP AGAINST HIM WHILE HE REASONED IN THIS WAY AS IF COMMERCE WERE EVERYTHING AND HUMANITY NOTHING SHE COULD HARDLY THANK HIM FOR THE INDIVIDUAL KINDNESS WHICH BROUGHT HIM THAT VERY EVENING TO OFFER HER
1690-142293-0071 FOR THE DELICACY WHICH MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST OFFER HER PRIVATELY EVERY CONVENIENCE FOR ILLNESS THAT HIS OWN WEALTH OR HIS MOTHER'S FORESIGHT HAD CAUSED THEM TO ACCUMULATE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD AND WHICH
1690-142293-0072 AS HE LEARNT FROM DOCTOR DONALDSON MISSUS HALE MIGHT POSSIBLY REQUIRE HIS PRESENCE AFTER THE WAY HE HAD SPOKEN HIS BRINGING BEFORE HER THE DOOM WHICH SHE WAS VAINLY TRYING TO PERSUADE HERSELF MIGHT YET BE AVERTED FROM HER MOTHER
1690-142293-0073 ALL CONSPIRED TO SET MARGARET'S TEETH ON EDGE AS SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND LISTENED TO HIM WHAT BUSINESS HAD HE TO BE THE ONLY PERSON EXCEPT DOCTOR DONALDSON AND DIXON ADMITTED TO THE AWFUL SECRET
1690-142293-0074 NOT DARING TO LOOK AT IT UNLESS SHE INVOKED HEAVENLY STRENGTH TO BEAR THE SIGHT THAT SOME DAY SOON SHE SHOULD CRY ALOUD FOR HER MOTHER AND NO ANSWER WOULD COME OUT OF THE BLANK DUMB DARKNESS
1690-142293-0075 YET HE KNEW ALL SHE SAW IT IN HIS PITYING EYES SHE HEARD IT IN HIS GRAVE AND TREMULOUS VOICE HOW RECONCILE THOSE EYES THAT VOICE WITH THE HARD REASONING DRY MERCILESS WAY
1690-142293-0076 IN WHICH HE LAID DOWN AXIOMS OF TRADE AND SERENELY FOLLOWED THEM OUT TO THEIR FULL CONSEQUENCES THE DISCORD JARRED UPON HER INEXPRESSIBLY THE MORE BECAUSE OF THE GATHERING WOE OF WHICH SHE HEARD FROM BESSY
1690-142293-0077 TO BE SURE NICHOLAS HIGGINS THE FATHER SPOKE DIFFERENTLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED A COMMITTEE MAN AND SAID THAT HE KNEW SECRETS OF WHICH THE EXOTERIC KNEW NOTHING HE SAID THIS MORE EXPRESSLY AND PARTICULARLY
1690-142293-0078 ON THE VERY DAY BEFORE MISSUS THORNTON'S DINNER PARTY WHEN MARGARET GOING IN TO SPEAK TO BESSY FOUND HIM ARGUING THE POINT WITH BOUCHER THE NEIGHBOUR OF WHOM SHE HAD FREQUENTLY HEARD MENTION AS BY TURNS EXCITING HIGGINS'S COMPASSION
1690-142293-0079 AS AN UNSKILFUL WORKMAN WITH A LARGE FAMILY DEPENDING UPON HIM FOR SUPPORT AND AT OTHER TIMES ENRAGING HIS MORE ENERGETIC AND SANGUINE NEIGHBOUR BY HIS WANT OF WHAT THE LATTER CALLED SPIRIT
1690-142293-0080 IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT HIGGINS WAS IN A PASSION WHEN MARGARET ENTERED BOUCHER STOOD WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE RATHER HIGH MANTEL PIECE SWAYING HIMSELF A LITTLE ON THE SUPPORT WHICH HIS ARMS THUS PLACED GAVE HIM
1690-142293-0081 AND LOOKING WILDLY INTO THE FIRE WITH A KIND OF DESPAIR THAT IRRITATED HIGGINS EVEN WHILE IT WENT TO HIS HEART BESSY WAS ROCKING HERSELF VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AS WAS HER WONT MARGARET KNEW BY THIS TIME
1690-142293-0082 WHEN SHE WAS AGITATED HER SISTER MARY WAS TYING ON HER BONNET IN GREAT CLUMSY BOWS AS SUITED HER GREAT CLUMSY FINGERS TO GO TO HER FUSTIAN CUTTING BLUBBERING OUT LOUD THE WHILE
1690-142293-0083 AND EVIDENTLY LONGING TO BE AWAY FROM A SCENE THAT DISTRESSED HER MARGARET CAME IN UPON THIS SCENE SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT AT THE DOOR THEN HER FINGER ON HER LIPS
1690-142293-0084 NICHOLAS SAW HER COME IN AND GREETED HER WITH A GRUFF BUT NOT UNFRIENDLY NOD MARY HURRIED OUT OF THE HOUSE CATCHING GLADLY AT THE OPEN DOOR AND CRYING ALOUD WHEN SHE GOT AWAY FROM HER FATHER'S PRESENCE
