4936-65528-0003 FOR SPRINGDALE HAS ALWAYS BEEN NOTED FOR GETTING GOOD LOOKING SCHOOLMARMS JUST AS MILLER'S ROAD IS NOTED FOR ITS HUMLY ONES
4936-65528-0004 BUT WHEN SHE SMILED YOU WOULD HAVE TO SMILE TOO IF YOU'D BEEN CHIEF MOURNER AT YOUR OWN FUNERAL SHE WAS A WELL SPRING OF JOY IN THE HOUSE AND WE ALL LOVED HER GILBERT MARTIN BEGAN TO DRIVE HER THE VERY FIRST WEEK SHE WAS HERE
4936-65528-0005 GILBERT IS MY SISTER JULIA'S SON AND A FINE YOUNG FELLOW HE IS IT AIN'T GOOD MANNERS TO BRAG OF YOUR OWN RELATIONS BUT I'M ALWAYS FORGETTING AND DOING IT GIL WAS A GREAT PET OF MINE HE WAS SO BRIGHT AND NICE MANNERED EVERYBODY LIKED HIM
4936-65528-0006 HIM AND ANNE WERE A FINE LOOKING COUPLE NORA MAY NOT BUT WHAT THEY HAD THEIR SHORTCOMINGS ANNE'S NOSE WAS A MITE TOO LONG AND GIL HAD A CROOKED MOUTH BESIDES THEY WAS BOTH PRETTY PROUD AND SPERRITED AND HIGH STRUNG
4936-65528-0007 BUT THEY THOUGHT AN AWFUL LOT OF EACH OTHER IT MADE ME FEEL YOUNG AGAIN TO SEE EM ANNE WASN'T A MOSSEL VAIN
4936-65528-0008 BUT NIGHTS SHE EXPECTED GIL SHE'D PRINK FOR HOURS AFORE HER GLASS FIXING HER HAIR THIS WAY AND THAT AND TRYING ON ALL HER GOOD CLOTHES TO SEE WHICH BECOME HER MOST I USED TO LOVE HER FOR IT
4936-65528-0009 AND I USED TO LOVE TO SEE THE WAY GIL'S FACE WOULD LIGHT UP WHEN SHE CAME INTO A ROOM OR PLACE WHERE HE WAS AMANDA PERKINS SHE SAYS TO ME ONCE ANNE DOUGLAS AND GIL MARTIN ARE MOST TERRIBLE STRUCK ON EACH OTHER
4936-65528-0010 AND SHE SAID IT IN A TONE THAT INDICATED THAT IT WAS A DREADFUL DISGRACEFUL AND UNBECOMING STATE OF AFFAIRS AMANDA HAD A DISAPPOINTMENT ONCE AND IT SOURED HER I IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED
4936-65528-0011 YES THEY ARE MOST TERRIBLE STRUCK ON EACH OTHER AND I SAID IT IN A TONE THAT INDICATED I THOUGHT IT A MOST BEAUTIFUL AND LOVELY THING THAT THEY SHOULD BE SO AND SO IT WAS
4936-65528-0012 ANOTHER NEPHEW OF MINE JAMES EBENEZER LAWSON HE CALLS HIMSELF JAMES E BACK THERE IN TOWN AND I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR I NEVER COULD STAND EBENEZER FOR A NAME MYSELF BUT THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE WELL HE SAID THEIR LOVE WAS IDYLLIC
4936-65528-0013 I AIN'T VERY SURE WHAT THAT MEANS I LOOKED IT UP IN THE DICTIONARY AFTER JAMES EBENEZER LEFT I WOULDN'T DISPLAY MY IGNORANCE AFORE HIM BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I WAS MUCH THE WISER FOR IT ANYWAY IT MEANT SOMETHING REAL NICE
4936-65528-0014 I WAS SURE OF THAT BY THE WAY JAMES EBENEZER SPOKE AND THE WISTFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES JAMES EBENEZER ISN'T MARRIED HE WAS TO HAVE BEEN AND SHE DIED A MONTH AFORE THE WEDDING DAY HE WAS NEVER THE SAME MAN AGAIN WELL TO GET BACK TO GILBERT AND ANNE
4936-65528-0015 WHEN ANNE'S SCHOOL YEAR ENDED IN JUNE SHE RESIGNED AND WENT HOME TO GET READY TO BE MARRIED
4936-65528-0016 ANNE THOUGHT THAT NOBODY COULD QUILT LIKE ME
4936-65528-0017 I DON'T KNOW RIGHTLY HOW THE TROUBLE BEGAN OTHER FOLKS JEALOUS FOLKS MADE MISCHIEF ANNE WAS THIRTY MILES AWAY AND GILBERT COULDN'T SEE HER EVERY DAY TO KEEP MATTERS CLEAR AND FAIR BESIDES AS I'VE SAID
4936-65528-0018 THEY WERE BOTH PROUD AND HIGH SPERRITED THE UPSHOT OF IT WAS THEY HAD A TERRIBLE QUARREL AND THE ENGAGEMENT WAS BROKEN WHEN TWO PEOPLE DON'T CARE OVERLY MUCH FOR EACH OTHER NORA MAY A QUARREL NEVER AMOUNTS TO MUCH BETWEEN THEM AND IT'S SOON MADE UP
4936-65528-0019 BUT WHEN THEY LOVE EACH OTHER BETTER THAN LIFE IT CUTS SO DEEP AND HURTS SO MUCH THAT NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN THEY WON'T EVER FORGIVE EACH OTHER THE MORE YOU LOVE ANYBODY NORA MAY THE MORE HE CAN HURT YOU TO BE SURE YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE THINKING OF SUCH THINGS
4936-65528-0020 BECAUSE WE HADN'T EVER SUSPECTED THINGS WERE GOING WRONG
4936-65528-0021 AND GILBERT HE WENT OUT TO MANITOBA ON A HARVEST EXCURSION AND STAYED THERE IT JUST ABOUT BROKE HIS PARENTS HEARTS HE WAS THEIR ONLY CHILD AND THEY JUST WORSHIPPED HIM
4936-65528-0022 GIL AND ANNE BOTH WROTE TO ME OFF AND ON BUT NEVER A WORD NOT SO MUCH AS A NAME DID THEY SAY OF EACH OTHER I'D A WRIT AND ASKED EM THE RIGHTS OF THE FUSS IF I COULD IN HOPES OF PATCHING IT UP BUT I CAN'T WRITE NOW MY HAND IS TOO SHAKY
4936-65528-0023 AND MEBBE IT WAS JUST AS WELL FOR MEDDLING IS TERRIBLY RISKY WORK IN A LOVE TROUBLE NORA MAY NINETY NINE TIMES OUT OF A HUNDRED THE LAST STATE OF A MEDDLER AND THEM SHE MEDDLES WITH IS WORSE THAN THE FIRST SO I JUST SET TIGHT AND SAID NOTHING
4936-65528-0024 WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE CLAN WAS TALKING ANNE AND GIL SIXTY WORDS TO THE MINUTE WELL LAST BIRTHDAY MORNING I WAS FEELING TERRIBLE DISPERRITED I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT MY BIRTHDAY WAS ALWAYS TO BE A GOOD THING FOR OTHER PEOPLE
4936-65528-0025 AND THERE DIDN'T SEEM ONE BLESSED THING I COULD DO TO MAKE ANYBODY GLAD EMMA MATILDA AND GEORGE AND THE CHILDREN WERE ALL WELL AND HAPPY AND WANTED FOR NOTHING THAT I COULD GIVE THEM I BEGUN TO BE AFRAID I'D LIVED LONG ENOUGH NORA MAY
4936-65528-0026 WHEN A WOMAN GETS TO THE POINT WHERE SHE CAN'T GIVE A GIFT OF JOY TO ANYONE THERE AIN'T MUCH USE IN HER LIVING I FELT REAL OLD AND WORN OUT AND USELESS I WAS SITTING HERE UNDER THESE VERY TREES
4936-65528-0027 THEY WAS JUST BUDDING OUT IN LEAF THEN AS YOUNG AND CHEERFUL AS IF THEY WASN'T A HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND I SIGHED RIGHT OUT LOUD AND SAID OH GRANDPA HOLLAND IT'S TIME I WAS PUT AWAY UP ON THE HILL THERE WITH YOU
4936-65528-0028 AND WITH THAT THE GATE BANGED AND THERE WAS NANCY JANE WHITMORE'S BOY SAM WITH TWO LETTERS FOR ME ONE WAS FROM ANNE UP AT SAINT MARY'S AND THE OTHER WAS FROM GIL OUT IN MANITOBA I READ ANNE'S FIRST
4936-65528-0029 SHE JUST STRUCK RIGHT INTO THINGS IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH SHE SAID HER YEAR AT SAINT MARY'S WAS NEARLY UP AND WHEN IT WAS SHE MEANT TO QUIT TEACHING AND GO AWAY TO NEW YORK AND LEARN TO BE A TRAINED NURSE SHE SAID SHE WAS JUST BROKEN HEARTED ABOUT GILBERT
4936-65528-0030 AND WOULD ALWAYS LOVE HIM TO THE DAY OF HER DEATH BUT SHE KNEW HE DIDN'T CARE ANYTHING MORE ABOUT HER AFTER THE WAY HE HAD ACTED AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HER IN LIFE BUT TO DO SOMETHING FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND SO ON AND SO ON FOR TWELVE MORTAL PAGES
4936-65528-0031 ANNE IS A FINE WRITER AND I JUST CRIED LIKE A BABE OVER THAT LETTER IT WAS SO TOUCHING ALTHOUGH I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF HUGELY ALL THE TIME I WAS SO DELIGHTED TO FIND OUT THAT ANNE LOVED GILBERT STILL I WAS GETTING SKEERED SHE DIDN'T
4936-65528-0032 AND THE NEW DRESSES SHE GOT NEW DRESSES WHEN I READ THAT LETTER OF ANNE'S I KNEW THAT ALL THE PURPLE AND FINE LINEN IN THE WORLD WAS JUST LIKE SO MUCH SACKCLOTH AND ASHES TO HER AS LONG AS GILBERT WAS SULKING OUT ON A PRAIRIE FARM
4936-65528-0033 WELL I WIPED MY EYES AND POLISHED UP MY SPECS
4936-65528-0034 BY THE MOST CURIOUS COINCIDENCE HE HAD OPENED HIS HEART TO ME TOO BEING A MAN HE WASN'T SO DISCURSIVE AS ANNE HE SAID HIS SAY IN FOUR PAGES BUT I COULD READ THE HEARTACHE BETWEEN THE LINES
4936-65528-0035 HE WROTE THAT HE WAS GOING TO KLONDIKE AND WOULD START IN A MONTH'S TIME HE WAS SICK OF LIVING NOW THAT HE'D LOST ANNE HE SAID HE LOVED HER BETTER THAN HIS LIFE AND ALWAYS WOULD AND COULD NEVER FORGET HER BUT HE KNEW SHE DIDN'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM NOW AFTER THE WAY SHE'D ACTED
4936-65528-0036 AND HE WANTED TO GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HER AND THE TORTURING THOUGHT OF HER AS HE COULD SO HE WAS GOING TO KLONDIKE GOING TO KLONDIKE NORA MAY WHEN HIS MOTHER WAS WRITING TO HIM TO COME HOME EVERY WEEK
4936-65528-0037 AND ANNE WAS BREAKING HER HEART FOR HIM AT SAINT MARY'S WELL I FOLDED UP THEM LETTERS AND SAYS I GRANDPA HOLLAND I GUESS MY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION IS HERE READY TO HAND I THOUGHT REAL HARD
4936-65528-0038 AND I COULDN'T GET ANYONE ELSE TO WRITE BECAUSE I COULDN'T LET OUT WHAT THEY'D TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE SO I DID A MEAN DISHONOURABLE THING NORA MAY I SENT ANNE'S LETTER TO GILBERT AND GILBERT'S TO ANNE I ASKED EMMA MATILDA TO ADDRESS THEM
4936-65528-0039 AND EMMA MATILDA DID IT AND ASKED NO QUESTIONS I BROUGHT HER UP THAT WAY THEN I SETTLED DOWN TO WAIT IN LESS THAN A MONTH GILBERT'S MOTHER HAD A LETTER FROM HIM SAYING THAT HE WAS COMING HOME TO SETTLE DOWN AND MARRY ANNE
4936-65528-0040 HE ARRIVED HOME YESTERDAY AND LAST NIGHT ANNE CAME TO SPRINGDALE ON HER WAY HOME FROM SAINT MARY'S THEY CAME TO SEE ME THIS MORNING AND SAID THINGS TO ME I AIN'T GOING TO REPEAT BECAUSE THEY WOULD SOUND FEARFUL VAIN
4936-65528-0041 THEY SAID THEIR NEW JOY WAS MY BIRTHDAY GIFT TO THEM THE WEDDING IS TO BE IN SEPTEMBER AND I'M GOING TO MONTROSE IN AUGUST TO HELP ANNE WITH HER QUILTS I DON'T THINK ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN TO PREVENT THIS TIME NO QUARRELLING ANYHOW THOSE TWO YOUNG CREATURES HAVE LEARNED THEIR LESSON
