8156-104526-0000 I THINK YOU HAVE AND BECAUSE YOU TELL ME SO I LIKE YOU ALL THE BETTER AS FOR AUGUSTUS BUT I WILL NOT BURDEN MY SPIRIT NOW AT THE LAST WITH UTTERING CURSES AGAINST MY OWN SON HE IS NOT WORTH IT
8156-104526-0001 NOW YOU ARE NOT HALF AS CLEVER A FELLOW AS HE IS
8156-104526-0002 BUT HE HAS BEEN UTTERLY UNABLE TO READ ME I HAVE POURED OUT MY MONEY WITH OPEN HANDS FOR BOTH OF YOU THAT IS TRUE SIR CERTAINLY AS REGARDS ME AND HAVE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT TILL IT WAS QUITE HOPELESS WITH YOU I WENT ON AND WOULD HAVE GONE ON
8156-104526-0003 AS THINGS WERE THEN I WAS BOUND TO DO SOMETHING TO SAVE THE PROPERTY
8156-104526-0004 AFTER ALL HE WAS QUITE RIGHT WITH HIS SUSPICIONS
8156-104526-0005 WELL IT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH THAT HE SHOULD NOT TRUST ME
8156-104526-0006 BUT HE WAS SUCH AN ASS THAT HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO KEEP ON GOOD TERMS WITH ME FOR THE FEW MONTHS THAT WERE LEFT AND THEN HE BROUGHT THAT BRUTE JONES DOWN HERE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ME AS TO ASKING MY LEAVE
8156-104526-0007 BUT WAITING FOR MY DEATH FROM DAY TO DAY HE IS A COLD BLOODED SELFISH BRUTE
8156-104526-0008 THAT I AM EVEN WITH HIM BEFORE ALL IS OVER I SHALL TRY IT ON WITH HIM SIR
8156-104526-0009 AND NOW IF I HAVE THIS MONEY IT WILL GIVE ME THE MEANS OF DOING SO YOU OUGHT TO KNOW FOR WHAT PURPOSE I SHALL USE IT THAT IS ALL SETTLED SAID THE FATHER THE DOCUMENT PROPERLY COMPLETED HAS GONE BACK WITH THE CLERK
8156-104526-0010 WERE I TO DIE THIS MINUTE YOU WOULD FIND THAT EVERYTHING INSIDE THE HOUSE IS YOUR OWN
8156-104526-0011 THERE IS A LOT OF PLATE WITH THE BANKER WHICH I HAVE NOT WANTED OF LATE YEARS
8156-104526-0012 THINGS WHICH I USED TO FANCY THOUGH I HAVE NOT CARED SO MUCH ABOUT THEM LATELY
8156-104526-0013 BUT THE BOOKS ARE THE MOST VALUABLE ONLY YOU DO NOT CARE FOR THEM I SHALL NOT HAVE A HOUSE TO PUT THEM IN THERE IS NO SAYING WHAT AN IDIOT WHAT A FOOL WHAT A BLIND UNTHINKING ASS AUGUSTUS HAS BEEN
8156-104526-0014 DO YOU REGRET IT SIR THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM AND THE HOUSE TOO I REGRET THAT MY SON SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A FOOL
8156-104526-0015 I DID NOT EVEN WANT HIM TO BE KIND TO ME
8156-104526-0016 BUT HE CAME HERE TO ENJOY HIMSELF
8156-104526-0017 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I HATE HIM MOST FOR THE HARDNESS OF HIS HEART OR DESPISE HIM FOR THE SLOWNESS OF HIS INTELLECT
8156-104526-0018 AT WHICH HE HAD FOUND HIMSELF THOROUGHLY EXHAUSTED NOW SHE CAME FOR THE THIRD TIME AND THAT PERIOD HAD ARRIVED
8156-104526-0019 WAS TOLD TO GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND SHOOT BIRDS OR HUNT FOXES
8156-104526-0020 THIS WAS A LONG GLOOMY ROOM WHICH CONTAINED PERHAPS TEN THOUSAND VOLUMES
8156-104526-0021 ALTHOUGH THE ROOM ITSELF WAS GLOOMY HE TOOK OUT BOOK AFTER BOOK AND TOLD HIMSELF WITH SOMETHING OF SADNESS IN HIS HEART THAT THEY WERE ALL CAVIARE TO HIM
8156-104526-0022 IT BECAME TO HIM UTTERLY CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE
8156-104526-0023 AND OF THIS HE COULD MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL HE WAS INFORMED BY A HEADING IN THE BOOK ITSELF THAT A PIECE OF POETRY WAS TO BE SUNG AS THE TEN COMMANDMENTS HE COULD NOT DO THAT AND PUT THE BOOK BACK AGAIN AND DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT FARTHER SEARCH WOULD BE USELESS
8156-104526-0024 THEN HE WANDERED ON INTO THE STATE DRAWING ROOM
8156-104526-0025 AND FOUND THAT ALL THE FURNITURE WAS CAREFULLY COVERED OF WHAT USE COULD IT ALL BE TO HIM
8156-104526-0026 AND LOOKED INTO THE HUGE MIRROR WHICH STOOD THERE
8156-104526-0027 IN EARLIER DAYS TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AT A TIME WHICH NOW SEEMED TO HIM TO BE VERY DISTANT HE HAD REGARDED FLORENCE AS HIS OWN AND AS SUCH HAD DEMANDED HER HAND
8156-104526-0028 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT HAD BEEN SO WITH MUCH SELF CONDEMNATION AT ANY RATE HE HAD LEARNED DURING THOSE MONTHS OF SOLITARY WANDERING THE POWER OF CONDEMNING HIMSELF AND NOW HE TOLD HIM THAT IF SHE WOULD YET COME
8156-104526-0029 HE MIGHT STILL LEARN TO SING THAT SONG OF THE OLD FASHIONED POET AS TO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
8156-104526-0030 OH FLORENCE MY FLORENCE HE SAID AS HE PASSED ON HE HAD DONE IT ALL FOR HIMSELF BROUGHT DOWN UPON HIS OWN HEAD THIS INFINITE RUIN AND FOR WHAT HE HAD SCARCELY EVER WON AND TRETTON WAS GONE FROM HIM FOREVER
8156-104526-0031 BUT STILL THERE MIGHT YET BE A CHANCE IF HE COULD ABSTAIN FROM GAMBLING AND THEN WHEN IT WAS DUSK WITHIN THE HOUSE HE WENT OUT AND PASSED THROUGH THE STABLES AND ROAMED ABOUT THE GARDENS TILL THE EVENING HAD ALTOGETHER SET IN AND BLACK NIGHT HAD COME UPON HIM
8156-104526-0032 TWO YEARS AGO HE HAD KNOWN THAT HE WAS THE HEIR TO IT ALL THOUGH EVEN THEN THAT HABIT WAS SO STRONG UPON HIM HE HAD FELT THAT HIS TENURE OF IT WOULD BE BUT SLIGHT
8156-104526-0033 HIS MARRIAGE HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE AND THE NEXT FATAL YEAR HAD FALLEN UPON HIM AS LONG AS THE INHERITANCE OF THE ESTATE WAS CERTAINLY HIS HE COULD ASSUREDLY RAISE MONEY AT A CERTAIN COST
8156-104526-0034 AND THE MONEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN FORTHCOMING AT A TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE
8156-104526-0035 ON THE FEW OCCASIONS ON WHICH THEY HAD MET WITH AN IMPERIOUSNESS WHICH HAD BEEN NATURAL TO HIM
8156-104526-0036 WHICH HAD BEEN IN TRUTH FINAL HAD COME AFTERWARD
8156-104526-0037 WHAT HAD FOLLOWED HAS BEEN TOLD ALREADY PERHAPS TOO OFTEN BUT AT THIS MOMENT AS HE STOOD IN THE GLOOM OF THE NIGHT BELOW THE PORCH IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE
8156-104526-0038 THOUGH HE WAS PREPARED TO GO TO LAW THE MOMENT THAT AUGUSTUS PUT HIMSELF FORWARD AS THE ELDEST SON HE DID RECOGNIZE HOW LONG SUFFERING HIS FATHER HAD BEEN AND HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR HIM IN ORDER IF POSSIBLE TO PRESERVE HIM
8156-104526-0039 HIS ANGER TOO AGAINST HIS BROTHER WAS QUITE AS HOT AS WAS THAT OF HIS FATHER
8156-104526-0040 AND FROM THAT HOUR AUGUSTUS HAD BECOME TO HIM THE MOST CRUEL OF TYRANTS AND THIS TYRANNY HAD COME TO AN END WITH HIS ABSOLUTE BANISHMENT FROM HIS BROTHER'S HOUSE
8156-104526-0041 HE WAS NOT THE MAN WHO COULD BEAR SUCH TYRANNY WELL I CAN FORGIVE MY FATHER HE SAID BUT AUGUSTUS I WILL NEVER FORGIVE
8156-104526-0042 AND IN A SHORT TIME WAS SITTING AT DINNER WITH MERTON THE YOUNG DOCTOR AND SECRETARY MISS SCARBOROUGH SELDOM CAME TO TABLE AT THAT HOUR BUT REMAINED IN A ROOM UP STAIRS CLOSE TO HER BROTHER
8156-104526-0043 UPON THE WHOLE MERTON HE SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY FATHER
8156-104526-0044 WILL HE LIVE OR WILL HE DIE HE WILL DIE CERTAINLY DO NOT JOKE WITH ME BUT I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT JOKE ON SUCH A SUBJECT AND MY QUESTION DID NOT MERELY GO TO THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM AS A MAN GENERALLY
8156-104526-0045 DO YOU CALL HIM AN HONEST MAN HOW AM I TO ANSWER YOU JUST THE TRUTH IF YOU WILL HAVE AN ANSWER I DO NOT CONSIDER HIM AN HONEST MAN ALL THIS STORY ABOUT YOUR BROTHER IS TRUE OR IS NOT TRUE
8156-104526-0046 IN NEITHER CASE CAN ONE LOOK UPON HIM AS HONEST JUST SO BUT I THINK THAT HE HAS WITHIN HIM A CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND AN UNSELFISHNESS WHICH ALMOST ATONES FOR HIS DISHONESTY AND THERE IS ABOUT HIM A STRANGE DISLIKE TO CONVENTIONALITY
8156-104526-0047 AND TO LAW WHICH IS SO INTERESTING AS TO MAKE UP THE BALANCE I HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED YOUR FATHER AS A MOST EXCELLENT MAN BUT THOROUGHLY DISHONEST HE WOULD ROB ANY ONE BUT ALWAYS TO EKE OUT HIS OWN GIFTS TO OTHER PEOPLE HE HAS THEREFORE TO MY EYES BEEN MOST ROMANTIC
8156-104526-0048 AND AS TO HIS HEALTH AH AS TO THAT I CANNOT ANSWER SO DECIDEDLY HE WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE I TELL HIM DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU COULD PROLONG HIS LIFE
8156-104526-0049 WHO CAN SAY SIR WILLIAM BRODRICK WHEN THAT FEARFUL OPERATION WAS PERFORMED IN LONDON THOUGHT THAT A MONTH WOULD SEE THE END OF IT THAT IS EIGHT MONTHS AGO AND HE HAS MORE VITALITY NOW THAN HE HAD THEN
8156-104526-0050 LATER ON IN THE EVENING MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH BEGAN AGAIN
8156-104526-0051 I AM PAID FOR IT ALL BUT HE HAS NOT LEFT YOU ANYTHING BY HIS WILL I HAVE CERTAINLY EXPECTED NOTHING AND THERE COULD BE NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD
8156-104526-0052 AND THEREFORE AS HE SAYS HE DOES NOT CHOOSE TO BURDEN HIS WILL WITH LEGACIES THERE IS SOME PROVISION MADE FOR MY AUNT WHO HOWEVER HAS HER OWN FORTUNE HE HAS TOLD ME TO LOOK AFTER YOU IT WILL BE QUITE UNNECESSARY SAID MISTER MERTON
8156-104526-0053 IF YOU CHOOSE TO CUT UP ROUGH YOU CAN DO SO I WOULD PROPOSE THAT WE SHOULD FIX UPON SOME SUM WHICH SHALL BE YOURS AT HIS DEATH JUST AS THOUGH HE HAD LEFT IT TO YOU INDEED HE SHALL FIX THE SUM HIMSELF MERTON OF COURSE
8156-104526-0054 BUT WITH THIS UNDERSTANDING MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH WENT THAT NIGHT TO BED EARLY ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HIS FATHER AGAIN SENT FOR HIM MOUNTJOY HE SAID
8156-104526-0055 ABOUT YOUR WILL NO NOT ABOUT MY WILL AT ALL THAT SHALL REMAIN AS IT IS I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD HAVE STRENGTH TO MAKE ANOTHER WILL NOR DO I WISH TO DO SO YOU MEAN ABOUT MERTON I DON'T MEAN ABOUT MERTON AT ALL GIVE HIM FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AND HE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED
