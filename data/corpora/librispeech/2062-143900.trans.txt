2062-143900-0000 AFTER THIS SHE THOUGHT EXCEPT OF HER JOURNEY ONLY OF ONE THING SHE MUST GO AND SEE PANSY FROM HER SHE COULDN'T TURN AWAY
2062-143900-0001 SHE HAD NOT SEEN HER YET AS OSMOND HAD GIVEN HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS TOO SOON TO BEGIN SHE DROVE AT FIVE O'CLOCK TO A HIGH FLOOR IN A NARROW STREET
2062-143900-0002 AND WAS ADMITTED BY THE PORTRESS OF THE CONVENT A GENIAL AND OBSEQUIOUS PERSON ISABEL HAD BEEN AT THIS INSTITUTION BEFORE SHE HAD COME WITH PANSY TO SEE THE SISTERS SHE KNEW THEY WERE GOOD WOMEN
2062-143900-0003 AND SHE SAW THAT THE LARGE ROOMS WERE CLEAN AND CHEERFUL AND THAT THE WELL USED GARDEN HAD SUN FOR WINTER AND SHADE FOR SPRING BUT SHE DISLIKED THE PLACE WHICH AFFRONTED AND ALMOST FRIGHTENED HER
2062-143900-0004 NOT FOR THE WORLD WOULD SHE HAVE SPENT A NIGHT THERE IT PRODUCED TO DAY MORE THAN BEFORE THE IMPRESSION OF A WELL APPOINTED PRISON FOR IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO PRETEND PANSY WAS FREE TO LEAVE IT THIS INNOCENT CREATURE
2062-143900-0005 HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HER IN A NEW AND VIOLENT LIGHT BUT THE SECONDARY EFFECT OF THE REVELATION WAS TO MAKE HER REACH OUT A HAND
2062-143900-0006 THE PORTRESS LEFT HER TO WAIT IN THE PARLOUR OF THE CONVENT WHILE SHE WENT TO MAKE IT KNOWN THAT THERE WAS A VISITOR FOR THE DEAR YOUNG LADY THE PARLOUR WAS A VAST COLD APARTMENT WITH NEW LOOKING FURNITURE
2062-143900-0007 A LARGE CLEAN STOVE OF WHITE PORCELAIN UNLIGHTED A COLLECTION OF WAX FLOWERS UNDER GLASS AND A SERIES OF ENGRAVINGS FROM RELIGIOUS PICTURES ON THE WALLS
2062-143900-0008 ON THE OTHER OCCASION ISABEL HAD THOUGHT IT LESS LIKE ROME THAN LIKE PHILADELPHIA BUT TO DAY SHE MADE NO REFLEXIONS THE APARTMENT ONLY SEEMED TO HER VERY EMPTY AND VERY SOUNDLESS
2062-143900-0009 USHERING IN ANOTHER PERSON ISABEL GOT UP EXPECTING TO SEE ONE OF THE LADIES OF THE SISTERHOOD BUT TO HER EXTREME SURPRISE FOUND HERSELF CONFRONTED WITH MADAME MERLE THE EFFECT WAS STRANGE
2062-143900-0010 ISABEL HAD BEEN THINKING ALL DAY OF HER FALSITY HER AUDACITY HER ABILITY HER PROBABLE SUFFERING AND THESE DARK THINGS SEEMED TO FLASH WITH A SUDDEN LIGHT AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
2062-143900-0011 OF HANDWRITINGS OF PROFANED RELICS OF GRIM THINGS PRODUCED IN COURT IT MADE ISABEL FEEL FAINT IF IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO SPEAK ON THE SPOT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE UNABLE
2062-143900-0012 BUT NO SUCH NECESSITY WAS DISTINCT TO HER IT SEEMED TO HER INDEED THAT SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY TO MADAME MERLE IN ONE'S RELATIONS WITH THIS LADY HOWEVER THERE WERE NEVER ANY ABSOLUTE NECESSITIES
2062-143900-0013 SHE HAD A MANNER WHICH CARRIED OFF NOT ONLY HER OWN DEFICIENCIES BUT THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE BUT SHE WAS DIFFERENT FROM USUAL SHE CAME IN SLOWLY BEHIND THE PORTRESS AND ISABEL INSTANTLY PERCEIVED
2062-143900-0014 THAT SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON HER HABITUAL RESOURCES FOR HER TOO THE OCCASION WAS EXCEPTIONAL AND SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO TREAT IT BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOMENT THIS GAVE HER A PECULIAR GRAVITY
2062-143900-0015 SHE PRETENDED NOT EVEN TO SMILE AND THOUGH ISABEL SAW THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN EVER PLAYING A PART IT SEEMED TO HER THAT ON THE WHOLE THE WONDERFUL WOMAN HAD NEVER BEEN SO NATURAL SHE LOOKED AT HER YOUNG FRIEND FROM HEAD TO FOOT
2062-143900-0016 BUT NOT HARSHLY NOR DEFIANTLY WITH A COLD GENTLENESS RATHER AND AN ABSENCE OF ANY AIR OF ALLUSION TO THEIR LAST MEETING IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD WISHED TO MARK A DISTINCTION SHE HAD BEEN IRRITATED THEN
2062-143900-0017 AND HAD LET HER EYES WANDER AS FAR AS THE LIMITS OF THE ROOM WOULD ALLOW SHE WISHED NEVER TO LOOK AT MADAME MERLE AGAIN YOU'RE SURPRISED TO FIND ME HERE AND I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NOT PLEASED THIS LADY WENT ON
2062-143900-0018 IT'S AS IF I HAD ANTICIPATED YOU I CONFESS I'VE BEEN RATHER INDISCREET I OUGHT TO HAVE ASKED YOUR PERMISSION THERE WAS NONE OF THE OBLIQUE MOVEMENT OF IRONY IN THIS IT WAS SAID SIMPLY AND MILDLY
2062-143900-0019 BUT ISABEL FAR AFLOAT ON A SEA OF WONDER AND PAIN COULD NOT HAVE TOLD HERSELF WITH WHAT INTENTION IT WAS UTTERED BUT I'VE NOT BEEN SITTING LONG MADAME MERLE CONTINUED THAT IS I'VE NOT BEEN LONG WITH PANSY
2062-143900-0020 I CAME TO SEE HER BECAUSE IT OCCURRED TO ME THIS AFTERNOON THAT SHE MUST BE RATHER LONELY AND PERHAPS EVEN A LITTLE MISERABLE
2062-143900-0021 AT ANY RATE IT'S A LITTLE DISMAL THEREFORE I CAME ON THE CHANCE I KNEW OF COURSE THAT YOU'D COME AND HER FATHER AS WELL STILL I HAD NOT BEEN TOLD OTHER VISITORS WERE FORBIDDEN
2062-143900-0022 THE GOOD WOMAN WHAT'S HER NAME MADAME CATHERINE MADE NO OBJECTION WHATEVER I STAYED TWENTY MINUTES WITH PANSY SHE HAS A CHARMING LITTLE ROOM NOT IN THE LEAST CONVENTUAL WITH A PIANO AND FLOWERS SHE HAS ARRANGED IT DELIGHTFULLY
2062-143900-0023 SHE HAS SO MUCH TASTE OF COURSE IT'S ALL NONE OF MY BUSINESS BUT I FEEL HAPPIER SINCE I'VE SEEN HER SHE MAY EVEN HAVE A MAID IF SHE LIKES BUT OF COURSE SHE HAS NO OCCASION TO DRESS SHE WEARS A LITTLE BLACK FROCK
2062-143900-0024 SHE LOOKS SO CHARMING I WENT AFTERWARDS TO SEE MOTHER CATHERINE WHO HAS A VERY GOOD ROOM TOO I ASSURE YOU I DON'T FIND THE POOR SISTERS AT ALL MONASTIC MOTHER CATHERINE HAS A MOST COQUETTISH LITTLE TOILET TABLE
2062-143900-0025 WITH SOMETHING THAT LOOKED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE SHE SPEAKS DELIGHTFULLY OF PANSY SAYS IT'S A GREAT HAPPINESS FOR THEM TO HAVE HER SHE'S A LITTLE SAINT OF HEAVEN AND A MODEL TO THE OLDEST OF THEM
2062-143900-0026 JUST AS I WAS LEAVING MADAME CATHERINE THE PORTRESS CAME TO SAY TO HER THAT THERE WAS A LADY FOR THE SIGNORINA OF COURSE I KNEW IT MUST BE YOU AND I ASKED HER TO LET ME GO AND RECEIVE YOU IN HER PLACE SHE DEMURRED GREATLY
2062-143900-0027 I MUST TELL YOU THAT AND SAID IT WAS HER DUTY TO NOTIFY THE MOTHER SUPERIOR IT WAS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE THAT YOU SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT I REQUESTED HER TO LET THE MOTHER SUPERIOR ALONE
2062-143900-0028 SO MADAME MERLE WENT ON WITH MUCH OF THE BRILLIANCY OF A WOMAN WHO HAD LONG BEEN A MISTRESS OF THE ART OF CONVERSATION BUT THERE WERE PHASES AND GRADATIONS IN HER SPEECH NOT ONE OF WHICH WAS LOST UPON ISABEL'S EAR
2062-143900-0029 THOUGH HER EYES WERE ABSENT FROM HER COMPANION'S FACE SHE HAD NOT PROCEEDED FAR BEFORE ISABEL NOTED A SUDDEN BREAK IN HER VOICE A LAPSE IN HER CONTINUITY WHICH WAS IN ITSELF A COMPLETE DRAMA
2062-143900-0030 THIS SUBTLE MODULATION MARKED A MOMENTOUS DISCOVERY THE PERCEPTION OF AN ENTIRELY NEW ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF HER LISTENER MADAME MERLE HAD GUESSED IN THE SPACE OF AN INSTANT
2062-143900-0031 AND IN THE SPACE OF ANOTHER INSTANT SHE HAD GUESSED THE REASON WHY THE PERSON WHO STOOD THERE WAS NOT THE SAME ONE SHE HAD SEEN HITHERTO BUT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON A PERSON WHO KNEW HER SECRET
2062-143900-0032 THIS DISCOVERY WAS TREMENDOUS AND FROM THE MOMENT SHE MADE IT THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED OF WOMEN FALTERED AND LOST HER COURAGE BUT ONLY FOR THAT MOMENT THEN
2062-143900-0033 THE CONSCIOUS STREAM OF HER PERFECT MANNER GATHERED ITSELF AGAIN AND FLOWED ON AS SMOOTHLY AS MIGHT BE TO THE END BUT IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE SHE HAD THE END IN VIEW THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO PROCEED
2062-143900-0034 BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT SHE SAW SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE BUDDING PLANTS AND THE GLOWING AFTERNOON SHE SAW IN THE CRUDE LIGHT OF THAT REVELATION WHICH HAD ALREADY BECOME A PART OF EXPERIENCE
2062-143900-0035 AND TO WHICH THE VERY FRAILTY OF THE VESSEL IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN OFFERED HER ONLY GAVE AN INTRINSIC PRICE
2062-143900-0036 AN APPLIED HANDLED HUNG UP TOOL AS SENSELESS AND CONVENIENT
2062-143900-0037 AND IRON ALL THE BITTERNESS OF THIS KNOWLEDGE SURGED INTO HER SOUL AGAIN IT WAS AS IF SHE FELT ON HER LIPS THE TASTE OF DISHONOUR THERE WAS A MOMENT DURING WHICH
2062-143900-0038 IF SHE HAD TURNED AND SPOKEN SHE WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING THAT WOULD HISS LIKE A LASH BUT SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND THEN THE HIDEOUS VISION DROPPED
2062-143900-0039 WHAT REMAINED WAS THE CLEVEREST WOMAN IN THE WORLD STANDING THERE WITHIN A FEW FEET OF HER AND KNOWING AS LITTLE WHAT TO THINK AS THE MEANEST ISABEL'S ONLY REVENGE WAS TO BE SILENT STILL
2062-143900-0040 TO LEAVE MADAME MERLE IN THIS UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION SHE LEFT HER THERE FOR A PERIOD THAT MUST HAVE SEEMED LONG TO THIS LADY WHO AT LAST SEATED HERSELF WITH A MOVEMENT WHICH WAS IN ITSELF A CONFESSION
2062-143900-0041 OF HELPLESSNESS THEN ISABEL TURNED SLOW EYES LOOKING DOWN AT HER MADAME MERLE WAS VERY PALE HER OWN EYES COVERED ISABEL'S FACE
2062-143900-0042 MADAME MERLE RECOVERED HERSELF SHE HAD A CHANCE TO EXPRESS SYMPATHY DO YOU GO ALONE YES WITHOUT MY HUSBAND
2062-143900-0043 A SORT OF RECOGNITION OF THE GENERAL SADNESS OF THINGS MISTER TOUCHETT NEVER LIKED ME BUT I'M SORRY HE'S DYING SHALL YOU SEE HIS MOTHER YES SHE HAS RETURNED FROM AMERICA
2062-143900-0044 SHE USED TO BE VERY KIND TO ME BUT SHE HAS CHANGED OTHERS TOO HAVE CHANGED
2062-143900-0045 SHE PAUSED A MOMENT THEN ADDED AND YOU'LL SEE DEAR OLD GARDENCOURT AGAIN
2062-143900-0046 ISABEL ANSWERED NATURALLY IN YOUR GRIEF BUT IT'S ON THE WHOLE
2062-143900-0047 THE ONE I SHOULD HAVE LIKED BEST TO LIVE IN I DON'T VENTURE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE MADAME MERLE ADDED BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY LOVE TO THE PLACE ISABEL TURNED AWAY I HAD BETTER GO TO PANSY
2062-143900-0048 I'VE NOT MUCH TIME WHILE SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER FOR THE PROPER EGRESS THE DOOR OPENED AND ADMITTED ONE OF THE LADIES OF THE HOUSE WHO ADVANCED WITH A DISCREET SMILE GENTLY RUBBING UNDER HER LONG LOOSE SLEEVES A PAIR OF PLUMP WHITE HANDS
2062-143900-0049 ISABEL RECOGNISED MADAME CATHERINE WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY MADE AND BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD IMMEDIATELY LET HER SEE MISS OSMOND MADAME CATHERINE LOOKED DOUBLY DISCREET BUT SMILED VERY BLANDLY AND SAID
2062-143900-0050 IT WILL BE GOOD FOR HER TO SEE YOU I'LL TAKE YOU TO HER MYSELF THEN SHE DIRECTED HER PLEASED GUARDED VISION TO MADAME MERLE WILL YOU LET ME REMAIN A LITTLE THIS LADY ASKED IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE
2062-143900-0051 AND THE GOOD SISTER GAVE A KNOWING LAUGH SHE LED ISABEL OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH SEVERAL CORRIDORS AND UP A LONG STAIRCASE ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS WERE SOLID AND BARE LIGHT AND CLEAN
2062-143900-0052 SO THOUGHT ISABEL ARE THE GREAT PENAL ESTABLISHMENTS MADAME CATHERINE GENTLY PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR OF PANSY'S ROOM AND USHERED IN THE VISITOR THEN STOOD SMILING WITH FOLDED HANDS
2062-143900-0053 WHILE THE TWO OTHERS MET AND EMBRACED SHE'S GLAD TO SEE YOU SHE REPEATED IT WILL DO HER GOOD AND SHE PLACED THE BEST CHAIR CAREFULLY FOR ISABEL BUT SHE MADE NO MOVEMENT TO SEAT HERSELF
2062-143900-0054 SHE SEEMED READY TO RETIRE HOW DOES THIS DEAR CHILD LOOK SHE ASKED OF ISABEL LINGERING A MOMENT SHE LOOKS PALE ISABEL ANSWERED THAT'S THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU SHE'S VERY HAPPY
2062-143900-0055 ELLE ECLAIRE LA MAISON SAID THE GOOD SISTER PANSY WORE AS MADAME MERLE HAD SAID A LITTLE BLACK DRESS IT WAS PERHAPS THIS THAT MADE HER LOOK PALE THEY'RE VERY GOOD TO ME THEY THINK OF EVERYTHING
2062-143900-0056 SHE EXCLAIMED WITH ALL HER CUSTOMARY EAGERNESS TO ACCOMMODATE WE THINK OF YOU ALWAYS YOU'RE A PRECIOUS CHARGE MADAME CATHERINE REMARKED IN THE TONE OF A WOMAN WITH WHOM BENEVOLENCE WAS A HABIT AND WHOSE CONCEPTION OF DUTY
2062-143900-0057 IT FELL WITH A LEADEN WEIGHT ON ISABEL'S EARS IT SEEMED TO REPRESENT THE SURRENDER OF A PERSONALITY THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH WHEN MADAME CATHERINE HAD LEFT THEM TOGETHER PANSY KNEELED DOWN
2062-143900-0058 IT'S VERY PRETTY YOU'RE VERY COMFORTABLE ISABEL SCARCELY KNEW WHAT SHE COULD SAY TO HER ON THE ONE HAND SHE COULDN'T LET HER THINK SHE HAD COME TO PITY HER AND ON THE OTHER IT WOULD BE A DULL MOCKERY TO PRETEND TO REJOICE WITH HER
2062-143900-0059 TO ENGLAND NOT TO COME BACK I DON'T KNOW WHEN I SHALL COME BACK AH
2062-143900-0060 ISABEL SAID AH YES YOU TOLD ME HE WOULD DIE OF COURSE YOU MUST GO AND WILL PAPA GO NO I SHALL GO ALONE FOR A MOMENT THE GIRL SAID NOTHING
2062-143900-0061 ISABEL HAD OFTEN WONDERED WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THE APPARENT RELATIONS OF HER FATHER WITH HIS WIFE BUT NEVER BY A GLANCE BY AN INTIMATION HAD SHE LET IT BE SEEN THAT SHE DEEMED THEM DEFICIENT IN AN AIR OF INTIMACY
2062-143900-0062 SHE MADE HER REFLEXIONS ISABEL WAS SURE AND SHE MUST HAVE HAD A CONVICTION THAT THERE WERE HUSBANDS AND WIVES WHO WERE MORE INTIMATE THAN THAT BUT PANSY WAS NOT INDISCREET EVEN IN THOUGHT
2062-143900-0063 SHE WOULD AS LITTLE HAVE VENTURED TO JUDGE HER GENTLE STEPMOTHER AS TO CRITICISE HER MAGNIFICENT FATHER HER HEART MAY HAVE STOOD ALMOST AS STILL AS IT WOULD HAVE DONE
2062-143900-0064 TURN THEIR PAINTED HEADS AND SHAKE THEM AT EACH OTHER BUT AS IN THIS LATTER CASE SHE WOULD FOR VERY SOLEMNITY'S SAKE NEVER HAVE MENTIONED THE AWFUL PHENOMENON SO SHE PUT AWAY ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SECRETS OF LARGER LIVES THAN HER OWN
2062-143900-0065 YOU'LL BE VERY FAR AWAY SHE PRESENTLY WENT ON YES I SHALL BE FAR AWAY BUT IT WILL SCARCELY MATTER ISABEL EXPLAINED SINCE SO LONG AS YOU'RE HERE I CAN'T BE CALLED NEAR YOU
2062-143900-0066 YES BUT YOU CAN COME AND SEE ME THOUGH YOU'VE NOT COME VERY OFTEN I'VE NOT COME BECAUSE YOUR FATHER FORBADE IT TO DAY I BRING NOTHING WITH ME I CAN'T AMUSE YOU I'M NOT TO BE AMUSED
2062-143900-0067 THAT'S NOT WHAT PAPA WISHES THEN IT HARDLY MATTERS WHETHER I'M IN ROME OR IN ENGLAND YOU'RE NOT HAPPY MISSUS OSMOND SAID PANSY NOT VERY BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
2062-143900-0068 THAT'S WHAT I SAY TO MYSELF WHAT DOES IT MATTER BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO COME OUT I WISH INDEED YOU MIGHT DON'T LEAVE ME HERE PANSY WENT ON GENTLY
2062-143900-0069 ISABEL SAID NOTHING FOR A MINUTE HER HEART BEAT FAST WILL YOU COME AWAY WITH ME NOW SHE ASKED PANSY LOOKED AT HER PLEADINGLY DID PAPA TELL YOU TO BRING ME
2062-143900-0070 NO IT'S MY OWN PROPOSAL I THINK I HAD BETTER WAIT THEN DID PAPA SEND ME NO MESSAGE I DON'T THINK HE KNEW I WAS COMING
2062-143900-0071 HE THINKS I'VE NOT HAD ENOUGH SAID PANSY BUT I HAVE THE LADIES ARE VERY KIND TO ME AND THE LITTLE GIRLS COME TO SEE ME THERE ARE SOME VERY LITTLE ONES SUCH CHARMING CHILDREN THEN MY ROOM
2062-143900-0072 WHAT HAVE YOU THOUGHT WELL THAT I MUST NEVER DISPLEASE PAPA YOU KNEW THAT BEFORE YES BUT I KNOW IT BETTER I'LL DO ANYTHING I'LL DO ANYTHING SAID PANSY
2062-143900-0073 THEN AS SHE HEARD HER OWN WORDS A DEEP PURE BLUSH CAME INTO HER FACE ISABEL READ THE MEANING OF IT SHE SAW THE POOR GIRL HAD BEEN VANQUISHED
2062-143900-0074 HAD KEPT HIS ENAMELS ISABEL LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND SAW THERE MAINLY A PRAYER TO BE TREATED EASILY SHE LAID HER HAND ON PANSY'S AS IF TO LET HER KNOW
2062-143900-0075 SEEMED ONLY HER TRIBUTE TO THE TRUTH OF THINGS SHE DIDN'T PRESUME TO JUDGE OTHERS BUT SHE HAD JUDGED HERSELF SHE HAD SEEN THE REALITY SHE HAD NO VOCATION FOR STRUGGLING WITH COMBINATIONS
2062-143900-0076 THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT OVERWHELMED HER SHE BOWED HER PRETTY HEAD TO AUTHORITY AND ONLY ASKED OF AUTHORITY TO BE MERCIFUL YES
2062-143900-0077 ISABEL GOT UP HER TIME WAS RAPIDLY SHORTENING GOOD BYE THEN I LEAVE ROME TO NIGHT PANSY TOOK HOLD OF HER DRESS THERE WAS A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE CHILD'S FACE YOU LOOK STRANGE YOU FRIGHTEN ME
2062-143900-0078 MY DEAR CHILD WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU SHE ASKED I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M HAPPIER WHEN I THINK OF YOU YOU CAN ALWAYS THINK OF ME NOT WHEN YOU'RE SO FAR I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
2062-143900-0079 SAID PANSY WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF OF PAPA A LITTLE AND OF MADAME MERLE SHE HAS JUST BEEN TO SEE ME YOU MUST NOT SAY THAT ISABEL OBSERVED OH I'LL DO EVERYTHING THEY WANT
2062-143900-0080 ONLY IF YOU'RE HERE I SHALL DO IT MORE EASILY ISABEL CONSIDERED I WON'T DESERT YOU SHE SAID AT LAST GOOD BYE MY CHILD THEN THEY HELD EACH OTHER A MOMENT IN A SILENT EMBRACE LIKE TWO SISTERS
2062-143900-0081 AND AFTERWARDS PANSY WALKED ALONG THE CORRIDOR WITH HER VISITOR TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE MADAME MERLE HAS BEEN HERE
2062-143900-0082 AND AS ISABEL ANSWERED NOTHING SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY I DON'T LIKE MADAME MERLE ISABEL HESITATED THEN STOPPED YOU MUST NEVER SAY THAT THAT YOU DON'T LIKE MADAME MERLE PANSY LOOKED AT HER IN WONDER
2062-143900-0083 BUT WONDER WITH PANSY HAD NEVER BEEN A REASON FOR NON COMPLIANCE I NEVER WILL AGAIN SHE SAID WITH EXQUISITE GENTLENESS AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE THEY HAD TO SEPARATE AS IT APPEARED TO BE PART OF THE MILD
2062-143900-0084 BUT VERY DEFINITE DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH PANSY LIVED THAT SHE SHOULD NOT GO DOWN ISABEL DESCENDED AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE BOTTOM THE GIRL WAS STANDING ABOVE YOU'LL COME BACK
2062-143900-0085 SHE CALLED OUT IN A VOICE THAT ISABEL REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS YES I'LL COME BACK MADAME CATHERINE MET MISSUS OSMOND BELOW AND CONDUCTED HER TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR OUTSIDE OF WHICH THE TWO STOOD TALKING A MINUTE
2062-143900-0086 I WON'T GO IN SAID THE GOOD SISTER MADAME MERLE'S WAITING FOR YOU AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ISABEL STIFFENED SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING IF THERE WERE NO OTHER EGRESS FROM THE CONVENT
2062-143900-0087 ABOUT MY STEP DAUGHTER OH IT WOULD TAKE LONG TO TELL YOU WE THINK IT'S ENOUGH MADAME CATHERINE DISTINCTLY OBSERVED AND SHE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR
2062-143900-0088 MADAME MERLE WAS SITTING JUST AS ISABEL HAD LEFT HER LIKE A WOMAN SO ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
2062-143900-0089 SHE WAS IN FULL POSSESSION OF HER RESOURCES I FOUND I WISHED TO WAIT FOR YOU SHE SAID URBANELY BUT IT'S NOT TO TALK ABOUT PANSY ISABEL WONDERED WHAT IT COULD BE TO TALK ABOUT
2062-143900-0090 AND IN SPITE OF MADAME MERLE'S DECLARATION SHE ANSWERED AFTER A MOMENT MADAME CATHERINE SAYS IT'S ENOUGH YES IT ALSO SEEMS TO ME ENOUGH I WANTED TO ASK YOU ANOTHER WORD ABOUT POOR MISTER TOUCHETT
2062-143900-0091 MADAME MERLE ADDED HAVE YOU REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S REALLY AT HIS LAST I'VE NO INFORMATION BUT A TELEGRAM UNFORTUNATELY IT ONLY CONFIRMS A PROBABILITY
2062-143900-0092 I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A STRANGE QUESTION SAID MADAME MERLE ARE YOU VERY FOND OF YOUR COUSIN AND SHE GAVE A SMILE AS STRANGE AS HER UTTERANCE YES I'M VERY FOND OF HIM
2062-143900-0093 BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SHE JUST HUNG FIRE IT'S RATHER HARD TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING HAS OCCURRED TO ME WHICH MAY NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO YOU AND I GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF MY IDEA

2062-143900-0095 HE MADE ME MADAME MERLE APPEARING TO SEE HERSELF SUCCESSFUL SHE WENT ON MORE TRIUMPHANTLY HE IMPARTED TO YOU THAT EXTRA LUSTRE WHICH WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE YOU A BRILLIANT MATCH
2062-143900-0096 AT BOTTOM IT'S HIM YOU'VE TO THANK SHE STOPPED THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ISABEL'S EYES I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU IT WAS MY UNCLE'S MONEY YES IT WAS YOUR UNCLE'S MONEY
2062-143900-0097 HE BROUGHT HIS FATHER OVER TO IT AH MY DEAR THE SUM WAS LARGE ISABEL STOOD STARING
2062-143900-0098 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SAY SUCH THINGS I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW I KNOW NOTHING BUT WHAT I'VE GUESSED BUT I'VE GUESSED THAT ISABEL WENT TO THE DOOR AND WHEN SHE HAD OPENED IT STOOD A MOMENT
2062-143900-0099 WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH THEN SHE SAID IT WAS HER ONLY REVENGE I BELIEVED IT WAS YOU I HAD TO THANK MADAME MERLE DROPPED HER EYES
2062-143900-0100 SHE STOOD THERE IN A KIND OF PROUD PENANCE YOU'RE VERY UNHAPPY I KNOW BUT I'M MORE SO YES
2062-143900-0101 MADAME MERLE RAISED HER EYES I SHALL GO TO AMERICA
