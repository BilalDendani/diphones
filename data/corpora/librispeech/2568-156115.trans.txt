2568-156115-0020 DIMMLER HAD FINISHED THE PIECE BUT STILL SAT SOFTLY RUNNING HIS FINGERS OVER THE STRINGS EVIDENTLY UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO STOP OR TO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE
2568-156115-0021 DO YOU KNOW SAID NATASHA IN A WHISPER MOVING CLOSER TO NICHOLAS AND SONYA THAT WHEN ONE GOES ON AND ON RECALLING MEMORIES ONE AT LAST BEGINS TO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE ONE WAS IN THE WORLD

2568-156115-0056 SANK IN THE SNOW WHICH WAS DRY AND GLITTERED LIKE SUGAR AND THREW IT UP
2568-156115-0057 THEIR RUNNERS SQUEAKING AT FIRST THEY DROVE AT A STEADY TROT ALONG THE NARROW ROAD WHILE THEY DROVE PAST THE GARDEN THE SHADOWS OF THE BARE TREES OFTEN FELL ACROSS THE ROAD AND HID THE BRILLIANT MOONLIGHT
2568-156115-0058 BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE PAST THE FENCE THE SNOWY PLAIN BATHED IN MOONLIGHT AND MOTIONLESS SPREAD OUT BEFORE THEM GLITTERING LIKE DIAMONDS AND DAPPLED WITH BLUISH SHADOWS
2568-156115-0059 BANG BANG WENT THE FIRST SLEIGH OVER A CRADLE HOLE IN THE SNOW OF THE ROAD AND EACH OF THE OTHER SLEIGHS JOLTED IN THE SAME WAY AND RUDELY BREAKING THE FROST BOUND STILLNESS

2568-156115-0064 EVER INCREASING THEIR GALLOP THAT ONE NOTICED HOW FAST THE TROYKA WAS FLYING NICHOLAS LOOKED BACK WITH SCREAMS SQUEALS AND WAVING OF WHIPS THAT CAUSED EVEN THE SHAFT HORSES TO GALLOP THE OTHER SLEIGHS FOLLOWED
2568-156115-0065 THE SHAFT HORSE SWUNG STEADILY BENEATH THE BOW OVER ITS HEAD WITH NO THOUGHT OF SLACKENING PACE AND READY TO PUT ON SPEED WHEN REQUIRED NICHOLAS OVERTOOK THE FIRST SLEIGH
2568-156115-0066 AND HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHAT IT IS IT IS SOMETHING NEW AND ENCHANTED WELL WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND SHOUTING TO HIS HORSES HE BEGAN TO PASS THE FIRST SLEIGH ZAKHAR HELD BACK HIS HORSES AND TURNED HIS FACE
