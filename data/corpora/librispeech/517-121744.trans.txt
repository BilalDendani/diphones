517-121744-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN MISSUS MITCHELL IS DEFEATED AFTER THIS TALK WITH MY FATHER I FELL INTO A SLEEP OF PERFECT CONTENTMENT AND NEVER THOUGHT OF WHAT MIGHT BE ON THE MORROW TILL THE MORROW CAME
517-121744-0001 THEN I GREW AWARE OF THE DANGER I WAS IN OF BEING CARRIED OFF ONCE MORE TO SCHOOL INDEED EXCEPT MY FATHER INTERFERED THE THING WAS ALMOST INEVITABLE I THOUGHT HE WOULD PROTECT ME BUT I HAD NO ASSURANCE HE WAS GONE AGAIN
517-121744-0002 FOR AS I HAVE MENTIONED ALREADY HE WAS GIVEN TO GOING OUT EARLY IN THE MORNINGS IT WAS NOT EARLY NOW HOWEVER I HAD SLEPT MUCH LONGER THAN USUAL I GOT UP AT ONCE INTENDING TO FIND HIM BUT TO MY HORROR
517-121744-0003 MY ENEMY MISSUS MITCHELL CAME INTO THE ROOM LOOKING TRIUMPHANT AND REVENGEFUL I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE GETTING UP SHE SAID IT'S NEARLY SCHOOL TIME THE TONE AND THE EMPHASIS SHE LAID ON THE WORD SCHOOL
517-121744-0004 EVEN IF HER EYES HAD NOT BEEN FIERCE WITH SUPPRESSED INDIGNATION I HAVEN'T HAD MY PORRIDGE I SAID YOUR PORRIDGE IS WAITING YOU AS COLD AS A STONE SHE ANSWERED IF BOYS WILL LIE IN BED SO LATE
517-121744-0005 WHAT CAN THEY EXPECT NOTHING FROM YOU I MUTTERED WITH MORE HARDIHOOD THAN I HAD YET SHOWN HER WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE SAYING SHE ASKED ANGRILY I WAS SILENT MAKE HASTE SHE WENT ON
517-121744-0006 AND DON'T KEEP ME WAITING ALL DAY YOU NEEDN'T WAIT MISSUS MITCHELL I AM DRESSING AS FAST AS I CAN IS PAPA IN HIS STUDY YET NO AND YOU NEEDN'T THINK TO SEE HIM HE'S ANGRY ENOUGH WITH YOU I'LL WARRANT
517-121744-0007 SHE LITTLE KNEW WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN MY FATHER AND ME ALREADY
517-121744-0008 YOU NEEDN'T THINK TO RUN AWAY AS YOU DID YESTERDAY I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT MISSUS SHAND TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOUR PAPA'S GONE TO SEE HER NOW AND TELL HER HOW SORRY HE IS YOU WERE SO NAUGHTY I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL
517-121744-0009 WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT I TELL YOU I WON'T GO AND I TELL YOU WE'LL SEE ABOUT IT I WON'T GO TILL I'VE SEEN PAPA IF HE SAYS I'M TO GO I WILL OF COURSE BUT I WON'T GO FOR YOU
517-121744-0010 YOU WILL AND YOU WON'T SHE REPEATED STANDING STARING AT ME AS I LEISURELY BUT WITH HANDS TREMBLING PARTLY WITH FEAR PARTLY WITH RAGE WAS FASTENING MY NETHER GARMENTS TO MY WAISTCOAT
517-121744-0011 THAT'S ALL VERY FINE BUT I KNOW SOMETHING A GOOD DEAL FINER NOW WASH YOUR FACE I WON'T SO LONG AS YOU STAND THERE I SAID AND SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS ME IF YOU TOUCH ME I'LL SCREAM
517-121744-0012 I CRIED SHE STOPPED THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND BOUNCED OUT OF THE ROOM BUT I HEARD HER TURN THE KEY OF THE DOOR I PROCEEDED WITH MY DRESSING AS FAST AS I COULD THEN AND THE MOMENT I WAS READY OPENED THE WINDOW
517-121744-0013 WHICH WAS ONLY A FEW FEET FROM THE GROUND SCRAMBLED OUT AND DROPPED I HURT MYSELF A LITTLE BUT NOT MUCH AND FLED FOR THE HARBOUR OF KIRSTY'S ARMS BUT AS I TURNED THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE I RAN RIGHT INTO MISSUS MITCHELL'S
517-121744-0014 WHO RECEIVED ME WITH NO SOFT EMBRACE IN FACT I WAS RATHER SEVERELY SCRATCHED WITH A PIN IN THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS THERE THAT SERVES YOU RIGHT SHE CRIED THAT'S A JUDGMENT ON YOU FOR TRYING TO RUN AWAY AGAIN AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE YOU GAVE US YESTERDAY TOO
517-121744-0015 YOU ARE A BAD BOY WHY AM I A BAD BOY I RETORTED IT'S BAD NOT TO DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD I WILL DO WHAT MY PAPA TELLS ME YOUR PAPA THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE THAN YOUR PAPA IN THE WORLD
517-121744-0016 I'M TO BE A BAD BOY IF I DON'T DO WHAT ANYBODY LIKE YOU CHOOSES TO TELL ME AM I NONE OF YOUR IMPUDENCE THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A BOX ON THE EAR SHE WAS NOW DRAGGING ME INTO THE KITCHEN
517-121744-0017 THERE SHE SET MY PORRIDGE BEFORE ME WHICH I DECLINED TO EAT WELL IF YOU WON'T EAT GOOD FOOD YOU SHALL GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT IT I TELL YOU I WON'T GO TO SCHOOL SHE CAUGHT ME UP IN HER ARMS
517-121744-0018 SHE WAS VERY STRONG AND I COULD NOT PREVENT HER CARRYING ME OUT OF THE HOUSE IF I HAD BEEN THE BAD BOY SHE SAID I WAS I COULD BY BITING AND SCRATCHING HAVE SOON COMPELLED HER TO SET ME DOWN BUT I FELT THAT I MUST NOT DO THAT FOR THEN I SHOULD BE ASHAMED BEFORE MY FATHER
517-121744-0019 I THEREFORE YIELDED FOR THE TIME AND FELL TO PLANNING NOR WAS I LONG IN COMING TO A RESOLUTION I DREW THE PIN THAT HAD SCRATCHED ME FROM HER DRESS I BELIEVED SHE WOULD NOT CARRY ME VERY FAR BUT IF SHE DID NOT SET ME DOWN SOON I RESOLVED TO MAKE HER GLAD TO DO SO
517-121744-0020 FURTHER I RESOLVED THAT WHEN WE CAME TO THE FOOT BRIDGE WHICH HAD BUT ONE RAIL TO IT I WOULD RUN THE PIN INTO HER AND MAKE HER LET ME GO WHEN I WOULD INSTANTLY THROW MYSELF INTO THE RIVER FOR I WOULD RUN THE RISK OF BEING DROWNED RATHER THAN GO TO THAT SCHOOL
517-121744-0021 WERE ALL MY GRIEFS OF YESTERDAY OVERCOME AND ON THE POINT OF BEING FORGOTTEN TO BE FRUSTRATED IN THIS FASHION MY WHOLE BLOOD WAS BOILING I WAS CONVINCED MY FATHER DID NOT WANT ME TO GO HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO ME DURING THE NIGHT
517-121744-0022 AND THEN SEND ME TO SUCH A PLACE IN THE MORNING BUT HAPPILY FOR THE GENERAL PEACE THINGS DID NOT ARRIVE AT SUCH A DESPERATE PASS BEFORE WE WERE OUT OF THE GATE MY HEART LEAPED WITH JOY FOR I HEARD MY FATHER CALLING MISSUS MITCHELL MISSUS MITCHELL
517-121744-0023 I LOOKED ROUND AND SEEING HIM COMING AFTER US WITH HIS LONG SLOW STRIDES I FELL TO STRUGGLING SO VIOLENTLY IN THE STRENGTH OF HOPE THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SET ME DOWN I BROKE FROM HER RAN TO MY FATHER AND BURST OUT CRYING
517-121744-0024 PAPA PAPA I SOBBED DON'T SEND ME TO THAT HORRID SCHOOL I CAN LEARN TO READ WITHOUT THAT OLD WOMAN TO TEACH ME REALLY MISSUS MITCHELL SAID MY FATHER TAKING ME BY THE HAND AND LEADING ME TOWARDS HER WHERE SHE STOOD VISIBLY FLAMING WITH RAGE AND ANNOYANCE
517-121744-0025 REALLY MISSUS MITCHELL YOU ARE TAKING TOO MUCH UPON YOU I NEVER SAID THE CHILD WAS TO GO TO THAT WOMAN'S SCHOOL IN FACT I DON'T APPROVE OF WHAT I HEAR OF HER AND I HAVE THOUGHT OF CONSULTING SOME OF MY BRETHREN IN THE PRESBYTERY ON THE MATTER BEFORE TAKING STEPS MYSELF
517-121744-0026 I WON'T HAVE THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN MY PARISH OPPRESSED IN SUCH A FASHION TERRIFIED WITH DOGS TOO IT IS SHAMEFUL SHE'S A VERY DECENT WOMAN MISTRESS SHAND
517-121744-0027 BUT I DOUBT VERY MUCH WHETHER SHE IS FIT TO HAVE THE CHARGE OF CHILDREN AND AS SHE IS A FRIEND OF YOURS YOU WILL BE DOING HER A KINDNESS TO GIVE HER A HINT TO THAT EFFECT IT MAY SAVE THE NECESSITY FOR MY TAKING FURTHER AND MORE UNPLEASANT STEPS
517-121744-0028 INDEED SIR BY YOUR LEAVE IT WOULD BE HARD LINES TO TAKE THE BREAD OUT OF THE MOUTH OF A LONE WIDOW WOMAN AND BRING HER UPON THE PARISH WITH A BAD NAME TO BOOT SHE'S SUPPORTED HERSELF FOR YEARS WITH HER SCHOOL AND BEEN A TROUBLE TO NOBODY
517-121744-0029 EXCEPT THE LAMBS OF THE FLOCK MISSUS MITCHELL I LIKE YOU FOR STANDING UP FOR YOUR FRIEND BUT IS A WOMAN BECAUSE SHE IS LONE AND A WIDOW TO MAKE A MOLOCH OF HERSELF AND HAVE THE CHILDREN SACRIFICED TO HER IN THAT WAY
517-121744-0030 SHE HAD BETTER SEE TO IT YOU TELL HER THAT FROM ME IF YOU LIKE AND DON'T YOU MEDDLE WITH SCHOOL AFFAIRS I'LL TAKE MY YOUNG MEN HE ADDED WITH A SMILE TO SCHOOL WHEN I SEE FIT
517-121744-0031 I'M SURE SIR SAID MISSUS MITCHELL PUTTING HER BLUE STRIPED APRON TO HER EYES I ASKED YOUR OPINION BEFORE I TOOK HIM I BELIEVE I DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ITS BEING TIME HE WERE ABLE TO READ
517-121744-0032 BUT I RECOLLECT NOTHING MORE YOU MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD ME HE ADDED WILLING TO EASE HER DESCENT TO THE VALLEY OF HER HUMILIATION SHE WALKED AWAY WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD SNIFFING THE AIR AS SHE WENT
517-121744-0033 FROM THAT HOUR I BELIEVE SHE HATED ME MY FATHER LOOKED AFTER HER WITH A SMILE AND THEN LOOKED DOWN ON ME SAYING SHE'S SHORT IN THE TEMPER POOR WOMAN AND WE MUSTN'T PROVOKE HER
517-121744-0034 I WAS TOO WELL SATISFIED TO URGE MY VICTORY BY FURTHER COMPLAINT
