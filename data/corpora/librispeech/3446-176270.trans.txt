3446-176270-0000 THE FLORENTINES GO TO WAR WITH LUCCA DISCOURSE OF A CITIZEN OF LUCCA TO ANIMATE THE PLEBEIANS AGAINST THE FLORENTINES THE LUCCHESE RESOLVE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THEY ARE ASSISTED BY THE DUKE OF MILAN TREATY BETWEEN THE FLORENTINES AND THE VENETIANS
3446-176270-0001 PEACE BETWEEN THE FLORENTINES AND THE LUCCHESE THE FLORENTINES EFFECT A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE POPE AND THE COUNT DI POPPI THE POPE CONSECRATES THE CHURCH OF SANTA REPARATA COUNCIL OF FLORENCE
3446-176270-0002 THE COUNT COMMENCED OPERATIONS AGAINST LUCCA IN APRIL FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND THE FLORENTINES DESIROUS OF RECOVERING WHAT THEY HAD THEMSELVES LOST BEFORE THEY ATTACKED OTHERS RETOOK SANTA MARIA IN CASTELLO
3446-176270-0003 THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH ALTHOUGH FAITHFUL TO THEIR RULERS BEING INFLUENCED MORE BY IMMEDIATE DANGER THAN BY ATTACHMENT TO THEIR DISTANT FRIENDS SURRENDERED IN THE SAME MANNER THEY OBTAINED MASSA AND SEREZANA TOWARD THE END OF MAY THEY PROCEEDED IN THE DIRECTION OF LUCCA
3446-176270-0004 AND LEAVING NOTHING UNDONE TO INJURE THE ENEMY THE LUCCHESE FINDING THEMSELVES ABANDONED BY THE DUKE AND HOPELESS OF DEFENDING THE OPEN COUNTRY FORSOOK IT ENTRENCHED AND FORTIFIED THE CITY WHICH THEY DOUBTED NOT BEING WELL GARRISONED THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DEFEND FOR A TIME
3446-176270-0005 AND THAT IN THE INTERIM SOME EVENT WOULD OCCUR FOR THEIR RELIEF AS HAD BEEN THE CASE DURING THE FORMER WARS WHICH THE FLORENTINES HAD CARRIED ON AGAINST THEM THEIR ONLY APPREHENSION AROSE FROM THE FICKLE MINDS OF THE PLEBEIANS WHO BECOMING WEARY OF THE SIEGE
3446-176270-0006 IF YOU SHOULD ACCUSE US OF HAVING CAUSED THE PRESENT WAR BY RECEIVING THE DUCAL FORCES INTO THE CITY AND ALLOWING THEM TO COMMIT HOSTILITIES AGAINST THE FLORENTINES YOU ARE GREATLY MISTAKEN YOU ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ANCIENT ENMITY OF THE FLORENTINES AGAINST YOU
3446-176270-0007 WHICH IS NOT OCCASIONED BY ANY INJURIES YOU HAVE DONE THEM OR BY FEAR ON THEIR PART BUT BY OUR WEAKNESS AND THEIR OWN AMBITION FOR THE ONE GIVES THEM HOPE OF BEING ABLE TO OPPRESS US AND THE OTHER INCITES THEM TO ATTEMPT IT
3446-176270-0008 BUT IF WE HAD NOT RECEIVED HIM THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME AND ASSIGNED SOME OTHER GROUND FOR IT AND IF THE EVIL HAD BEEN DELAYED IT WOULD MOST PROBABLY HAVE BEEN GREATER
3446-176270-0009 THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT IMAGINE IT TO BE OCCASIONED BY HIS ARRIVAL BUT RATHER BY YOUR OWN ILL FORTUNE AND THEIR AMBITION
3446-176270-0010 AND BEING COME WE COULD NOT PREVENT THEIR AGGRESSIONS YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT THE AID OF SOME POWERFUL ALLY WE ARE INCAPABLE OF SELF DEFENSE AND THAT NONE CAN RENDER US THIS SERVICE MORE POWERFULLY OR FAITHFULLY THAN THE DUKE
3446-176270-0011 HE RESTORED OUR LIBERTY IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT HE WILL DEFEND IT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST FOE OF OUR INVETERATE ENEMIES IF THEREFORE TO AVOID INCENSING THE FLORENTINES WE HAD EXCITED HIS ANGER WE SHOULD HAVE LOST OUR BEST FRIEND
3446-176270-0012 AND RENDERED OUR ENEMY MORE POWERFUL AND MORE DISPOSED TO OPPRESS US SO THAT IT IS FAR PREFERABLE TO HAVE THIS WAR UPON OUR HANDS AND ENJOY THE FAVOR OF THE DUKE THAN TO BE IN PEACE WITHOUT IT
3446-176270-0013 BESIDES WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN EXPECTING THAT HE WILL RESCUE US FROM THE DANGERS INTO WHICH WE ARE BROUGHT ON HIS ACCOUNT IF WE ONLY DO NOT ABANDON OUR OWN CAUSE YOU ALL KNOW HOW FIERCELY THE FLORENTINES HAVE FREQUENTLY ASSAILED US
3446-176270-0014 AND WITH WHAT GLORY WE HAVE MAINTAINED OUR DEFENSE WE HAVE OFTEN BEEN DEPRIVED OF EVERY HOPE EXCEPT IN GOD AND THE CASUALTIES WHICH TIME MIGHT PRODUCE AND BOTH HAVE PROVED OUR FRIENDS AND AS THEY HAVE DELIVERED US FORMERLY
3446-176270-0015 FOR THEY WILL NOT WILLINGLY SEE THE POWER OF FLORENCE INCREASED ON A FORMER OCCASION THE FLORENTINES WERE MORE AT LIBERTY THEY HAD GREATER HOPE OF ASSISTANCE AND WERE MORE POWERFUL IN THEMSELVES WHILE WE WERE IN EVERY RESPECT WEAKER
3446-176270-0016 FOR THEN A TYRANT GOVERNED US NOW WE DEFEND OURSELVES THEN THE GLORY OF OUR DEFENSE WAS ANOTHER'S NOW IT IS OUR OWN THEN THEY WERE IN HARMONY NOW THEY ARE DISUNITED ALL ITALY BEING FILLED
3446-176270-0017 FOR ALL SEEK THEIR OWN GLORY AND YOUR RUIN ABOVE ALL OTHERS YOU HAVE TO DREAD THE FLORENTINES FOR THEY WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY SUBMISSION AND TRIBUTE OR THE DOMINION OF OUR CITY BUT THEY WOULD POSSESS OUR ENTIRE SUBSTANCE AND PERSONS
3446-176270-0018 THE REST WILL BE SAVED AS A MATTER OF COURSE IF WE LOSE HER
3446-176270-0019 OR SUBMIT TO ANY TERMS THAT COULD VIOLATE THEIR LIBERTY THEY THEN MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE CITY IN THE MEANTIME THE FLORENTINE FORCES WERE NOT IDLE AND AFTER INNUMERABLE MISCHIEFS DONE TO THE COUNTRY
3446-176270-0020 TOOK MONTE CARLO BY CAPITULATION THEY THEN BESIEGED UZZANO
3446-176270-0021 MIGHT DESPAIR OF ASSISTANCE AND BE COMPELLED TO SUBMISSION BY FAMINE THE FORTRESS WAS VERY STRONG AND DEFENDED BY A NUMEROUS GARRISON SO THAT ITS CAPTURE WOULD BE BY NO MEANS AN EASY UNDERTAKING
3446-176270-0022 THE LUCCHESE AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED SEEING THE IMMINENT PERIL OF THEIR SITUATION HAD RECOURSE TO THE DUKE AND EMPLOYED PRAYERS AND REMONSTRANCES TO INDUCE HIM TO RENDER THEM AID THEY ENLARGED UPON THEIR OWN MERITS AND THE OFFENSES OF THE FLORENTINES
3446-176270-0023 AND SHOWED HOW GREATLY IT WOULD ATTACH THE DUKE'S FRIENDS TO HIM TO FIND THEY WERE DEFENDED AND HOW MUCH DISAFFECTION IT WOULD SPREAD AMONG THEM IF THEY WERE LEFT TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE ENEMY
3446-176270-0024 SO THAT IF HE WERE UNMOVED BY GRATITUDE TO THEM HE MIGHT BE INDUCED TO THEIR DEFENSE BY MOTIVES OF COMPASSION THE DUKE INFLUENCED BY HIS INVETERATE HOSTILITY AGAINST THE FLORENTINES HIS NEW OBLIGATION TO THE LUCCHESE
3446-176270-0025 THAN FROM THEIR DESIRE TO FRUSTRATE THIS EXPEDITION THE COUNT ON THE OTHER HAND WAS READY TO PASS INTO LOMBARDY WHENEVER THE LEAGUE MIGHT REQUIRE HIM BUT WOULD NOT ALTER THE TENOR OF HIS ENGAGEMENT
3446-176270-0026 THE COUNT WOULD NOT CONSENT TO PASS THE PO AND THE VENETIANS REFUSED TO ACCEPT HIM ON ANY OTHER CONDITION SEEING NO OTHER METHOD OF ARRANGEMENT THAN THAT EACH SHOULD MAKE LIBERAL CONCESSIONS THE FLORENTINES INDUCED THE COUNT TO CROSS THE RIVER
3446-176270-0027 WOULD BE COMPELLED TO PROCEED AND THAT THE EVIL APPREHENDED BY THE FLORENTINES WOULD BE AVERTED TO THE VENETIANS ON THE OTHER HAND THEY AVERRED THAT THIS PRIVATE LETTER WAS SUFFICIENTLY BINDING AND THEREFORE THEY OUGHT TO BE CONTENT
3446-176270-0028 FOR IF THEY COULD SAVE THE COUNT FROM BREAKING WITH HIS FATHER IN LAW IT WAS WELL TO DO SO AND THAT IT COULD BE OF NO ADVANTAGE EITHER TO THEMSELVES OR THE VENETIANS TO PUBLISH IT WITHOUT SOME MANIFEST NECESSITY IT WAS THUS DETERMINED THAT THE COUNT SHOULD PASS INTO LOMBARDY
3446-176270-0029 AND HAVING TAKEN UZZANO AND RAISED BASTIONS ABOUT LUCCA TO RESTRAIN IN HER INHABITANTS PLACED THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SIEGE IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMISSARIES CROSSED THE APENNINES AND PROCEEDED TO REGGIO WHEN THE VENETIANS
3446-176270-0030 ALARMED AT HIS PROGRESS AND IN ORDER TO DISCOVER HIS INTENTIONS INSISTED UPON HIS IMMEDIATELY CROSSING THE PO AND JOINING THE OTHER FORCES THE COUNT REFUSED COMPLIANCE AND MANY MUTUAL RECRIMINATIONS TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND ANDREA
3446-176270-0031 BUT FOUND HIM INDISPOSED TO DO SO FOR THE DUKE HAVING BEEN INFORMED THAT OUT OF REGARD TO HIM HE HAD REFUSED TO CROSS THE PO THOUGHT THAT BY THIS MEANS HE MIGHT ALSO SAVE THE LUCCHESE
3446-176270-0032 AND BEGGED THE COUNT TO ENDEAVOR TO EFFECT AN ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN THE FLORENTINES AND THE LUCCHESE INCLUDING HIMSELF IN IT IF HE WERE ABLE DECLARING AT THE SAME TIME THE PROMISED MARRIAGE SHOULD BE SOLEMNIZED WHENEVER HE THOUGHT PROPER
3446-176270-0033 THE PROSPECT OF THIS CONNECTION HAD GREAT INFLUENCE WITH THE COUNT FOR AS THE DUKE HAD NO SONS IT GAVE HIM HOPE OF BECOMING SOVEREIGN OF MILAN FOR THIS REASON HE GRADUALLY ABATED HIS EXERTIONS IN THE WAR
3446-176270-0034 FOR THEY FOUND THEIR EXPEDITION AGAINST LUCCA FRUSTRATED AND TREMBLED FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN TERRITORIES IF EVER THE COUNT AND THE DUKE SHOULD ENTER INTO A MUTUAL ALLIANCE TO INDUCE THE VENETIANS TO RETAIN THE COUNT IN THE COMMAND
3446-176270-0035 COSMO DE MEDICI WENT TO VENICE HOPING HIS INFLUENCE WOULD PREVAIL WITH THEM AND DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT AT GREAT LENGTH BEFORE THE SENATE POINTING OUT THE CONDITION OF THE ITALIAN STATES THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR ARMIES AND THE GREAT PREPONDERANCE POSSESSED BY THE DUKE
3446-176270-0036 AND THAT OF THE ITALIANS AND THOUGHT THEMSELVES ABLE AT ALL EVENTS TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN DEFENSE THAT IT WAS NOT THEIR CUSTOM TO PAY SOLDIERS FOR SERVING OTHERS THAT AS THE FLORENTINES HAD USED THE COUNT'S SERVICES THEY MUST PAY HIM THEMSELVES
3446-176270-0037 IT THEREFORE SEEMED NECESSARY TO CURB HIS INSOLENCE AND NOT ALLOW IT TO INCREASE TILL IT BECAME INCORRIGIBLE AND THAT IF THE FLORENTINES FROM FEAR OR ANY OTHER MOTIVE WISHED TO PRESERVE HIS FRIENDSHIP THEY MUST PAY HIM THEMSELVES COSMO RETURNED
3446-176270-0038 THAT ANY TRIVIAL ACCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE HIS COURSE AS INDEED SHORTLY HAPPENED THE COUNT HAD LEFT HIS TERRITORIES IN LA MARCA TO THE CARE OF IL FURLANO ONE OF HIS PRINCIPAL CONDOTTIERI
3446-176270-0039 WHO WAS SO FAR INFLUENCED BY THE DUKE AS TO TAKE COMMAND UNDER HIM AND QUIT THE COUNT'S SERVICE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE CAUSED THE LATTER TO LAY ASIDE EVERY IDEA BUT THAT OF HIS OWN SAFETY AND TO COME TO AGREEMENT WITH THE DUKE
3446-176270-0040 AND SO CONVINCED THEM OF THE NECESSITY OF THIS THAT SEEING NO BETTER COURSE TO ADOPT THEY COMPLIED IN APRIL FOURTEEN THIRTY EIGHT BY WHICH TREATY THE LUCCHESE RETAINED THEIR LIBERTY AND THE FLORENTINES MONTE CARLO AND A FEW OTHER FORTRESSES
3446-176270-0041 AT THE DECEASE OF HIS SON IN LAW HELD THE BORGO SAN SEPOLCRO AND OTHER FORTRESSES OF THAT DISTRICT AND WHILE NICCOLO LIVED GOVERNED THEM IN HIS NAME CLAIMING THEM AS HIS DAUGHTER'S PORTION
3446-176270-0042 HE REFUSED TO GIVE THEM UP TO THE POPE WHO DEMANDED THEM AS PROPERTY HELD OF THE CHURCH AND WHO UPON HIS REFUSAL SENT THE PATRIARCH WITH FORCES TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THEM THE COUNT FINDING HIMSELF UNABLE TO SUSTAIN THE ATTACK OFFERED THEM TO THE FLORENTINES
3446-176270-0043 WHO DECLINED THEM BUT THE POPE HAVING RETURNED TO FLORENCE THEY INTERCEDED WITH HIM IN THE COUNT'S BEHALF DIFFICULTIES ARISING THE PATRIARCH ATTACKED THE CASENTINO TOOK PRATO VECCHIO AND ROMENA AND OFFERED THEM ALSO TO THE FLORENTINES
3446-176270-0044 WHO REFUSED THEM LIKEWISE UNLESS THE POPE WOULD CONSENT THEY SHOULD RESTORE THEM TO THE COUNT TO WHICH AFTER MUCH HESITATION HE ACCEDED ON CONDITION THAT THE FLORENTINES SHOULD PREVAIL WITH THE COUNT DI POPPI TO RESTORE THE BORGO TO HIM
3446-176270-0045 WHICH HAD BEEN COMMENCED LONG AGO AS TO ENABLE THEM TO PERFORM DIVINE SERVICE IN IT REQUESTED HIS HOLINESS TO CONSECRATE IT TO THIS THE PONTIFF WILLINGLY AGREED AND THE FLORENTINES TO EXHIBIT THE WEALTH OF THE CITY AND THE SPLENDOR OF THE EDIFICE AND DO GREATER HONOR TO THE POPE
3446-176270-0046 ERECTED A PLATFORM FROM SANTA MARIA NOVELLA WHERE HE RESIDED TO THE CATHEDRAL HE WAS ABOUT TO CONSECRATE SIX FEET IN HEIGHT AND TWELVE FEET WIDE COVERED WITH RICH DRAPERY FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE PONTIFF AND HIS COURT
3446-176270-0047 UPON WHICH THEY PROCEEDED TO THE BUILDING ACCOMPANIED BY THOSE CIVIC MAGISTRATES AND OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE APPOINTED TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION THE USUAL CEREMONIES OF CONSECRATION HAVING BEEN COMPLETED THE POPE TO SHOW HIS AFFECTION FOR THE CITY
3446-176270-0048 CONFERRED THE HONOR OF KNIGHTHOOD UPON GIULIANO DAVANZATI THEIR GONFALONIER OF JUSTICE AND A CITIZEN OF THE HIGHEST REPUTATION AND THE SIGNORY NOT TO APPEAR LESS GRACIOUS THAN THE POPE GRANTED TO THE NEW CREATED KNIGHT
3446-176270-0049 THE GOVERNMENT OF PISA FOR ONE YEAR THERE WERE AT THAT TIME CERTAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ROMAN AND THE GREEK CHURCHES WHICH PREVENTED PERFECT CONFORMITY IN DIVINE SERVICE AND AT THE LAST COUNCIL OF BALE
3446-176270-0050 THE PRELATES OF THE WESTERN CHURCH HAVING SPOKEN AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE SUBJECT IT WAS RESOLVED THAT EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO BRING THE EMPEROR AND THE GREEK PRELATES TO THE COUNCIL AT BALE TO ENDEAVOR TO RECONCILE THE GREEK CHURCH WITH THE ROMAN
3446-176270-0051 ASSEMBLED AT BALE CAME TO VENICE
