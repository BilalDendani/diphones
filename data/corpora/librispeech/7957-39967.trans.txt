7957-39967-0000 FOR THE MOST PART SAVE INCIDENTALLY WE HAVE HITHERTO BEEN CONCERNED WITH EDUCATION AS IT MAY EXIST IN ANY SOCIAL GROUP WE HAVE NOW TO MAKE EXPLICIT THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SPIRIT MATERIAL AND METHOD OF EDUCATION AS IT OPERATES IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNITY LIFE
7957-39967-0001 TO SAY THAT EDUCATION IS A SOCIAL FUNCTION SECURING DIRECTION AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE IMMATURE THROUGH THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE LIFE OF THE GROUP TO WHICH THEY BELONG IS TO SAY IN EFFECT THAT EDUCATION WILL VARY WITH THE QUALITY OF LIFE WHICH PREVAILS IN A GROUP PARTICULARLY
7957-39967-0002 WILL HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND METHODS OF EDUCATION FROM ONE WHICH AIMS SIMPLY AT THE PERPETUATION OF ITS OWN CUSTOMS TO MAKE THE GENERAL IDEAS SET FORTH APPLICABLE TO OUR OWN EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO COME TO CLOSER QUARTERS
7957-39967-0003 WITH THE NATURE OF PRESENT SOCIAL LIFE ONE THE IMPLICATIONS OF HUMAN ASSOCIATION SOCIETY IS ONE WORD BUT MANY THINGS MEN ASSOCIATE TOGETHER IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS AND FOR ALL KINDS OF PURPOSES
7957-39967-0004 ONE MAN IS CONCERNED IN A MULTITUDE OF DIVERSE GROUPS IN WHICH HIS ASSOCIATES MAY BE QUITE DIFFERENT IT OFTEN SEEMS AS IF THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE MODES OF ASSOCIATED LIFE WITHIN EVERY LARGER SOCIAL ORGANIZATION
7957-39967-0005 THERE ARE NUMEROUS MINOR GROUPS NOT ONLY POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS BUT INDUSTRIAL SCIENTIFIC RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATIONS THERE ARE POLITICAL PARTIES WITH DIFFERING AIMS SOCIAL SETS CLIQUES GANGS CORPORATIONS PARTNERSHIPS
7957-39967-0006 GROUPS BOUND CLOSELY TOGETHER BY TIES OF BLOOD AND SO ON IN ENDLESS VARIETY IN MANY MODERN STATES AND IN SOME ANCIENT THERE IS GREAT DIVERSITY OF POPULATIONS OF VARYING LANGUAGES
7957-39967-0007 THE FORMER CONNOTATION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UPPERMOST SOCIETY IS CONCEIVED AS ONE BY ITS VERY NATURE THE QUALITIES WHICH ACCOMPANY THIS UNITY PRAISEWORTHY COMMUNITY OF PURPOSE AND WELFARE LOYALTY TO PUBLIC ENDS MUTUALITY OF SYMPATHY
7957-39967-0008 ARE EMPHASIZED BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FACTS WHICH THE TERM DENOTES INSTEAD OF CONFINING OUR ATTENTION TO ITS INTRINSIC CONNOTATION WE FIND NOT UNITY BUT A PLURALITY OF SOCIETIES GOOD AND BAD MEN BANDED TOGETHER IN A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY
7957-39967-0009 BUSINESS AGGREGATIONS THAT PREY UPON THE PUBLIC WHILE SERVING IT POLITICAL MACHINES HELD TOGETHER BY THE INTEREST OF PLUNDER ARE INCLUDED IF IT IS SAID THAT SUCH ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT SOCIETIES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEET THE IDEAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE NOTION OF SOCIETY
7957-39967-0010 THE ANSWER IN PART IS THAT THE CONCEPTION OF SOCIETY IS THEN MADE SO IDEAL AS TO BE OF NO USE HAVING NO REFERENCE TO FACTS AND IN PART THAT EACH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS NO MATTER HOW OPPOSED TO THE INTERESTS OF OTHER GROUPS
7957-39967-0011 HAS SOMETHING OF THE PRAISEWORTHY QUALITIES OF SOCIETY WHICH HOLD IT TOGETHER THERE IS HONOR AMONG THIEVES AND A BAND OF ROBBERS HAS A COMMON INTEREST AS RESPECTS ITS MEMBERS GANGS ARE MARKED BY FRATERNAL FEELING
7957-39967-0012 AND NARROW CLIQUES BY INTENSE LOYALTY TO THEIR OWN CODES FAMILY LIFE MAY BE MARKED BY EXCLUSIVENESS SUSPICION AND JEALOUSY AS TO THOSE WITHOUT AND YET BE A MODEL OF AMITY AND MUTUAL AID WITHIN
7957-39967-0013 ANY EDUCATION GIVEN BY A GROUP TENDS TO SOCIALIZE ITS MEMBERS BUT THE QUALITY AND VALUE OF THE SOCIALIZATION DEPENDS UPON THE HABITS AND AIMS OF THE GROUP HENCE ONCE MORE THE NEED OF A MEASURE FOR THE WORTH OF ANY GIVEN MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE
7957-39967-0014 IN SEEKING THIS MEASURE WE HAVE TO AVOID TWO EXTREMES WE CANNOT SET UP OUT OF OUR HEADS SOMETHING WE REGARD AS AN IDEAL SOCIETY WE MUST BASE OUR CONCEPTION UPON SOCIETIES WHICH ACTUALLY EXIST
7957-39967-0015 BUT AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN THE IDEAL CANNOT SIMPLY REPEAT THE TRAITS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY FOUND THE PROBLEM IS TO EXTRACT THE DESIRABLE TRAITS OF FORMS OF COMMUNITY LIFE WHICH ACTUALLY EXIST
7957-39967-0016 AND EMPLOY THEM TO CRITICIZE UNDESIRABLE FEATURES AND SUGGEST IMPROVEMENT NOW IN ANY SOCIAL GROUP WHATEVER EVEN IN A GANG OF THIEVES WE FIND SOME INTEREST HELD IN COMMON
7957-39967-0017 AND WE FIND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INTERACTION AND COOPERATIVE INTERCOURSE WITH OTHER GROUPS FROM THESE TWO TRAITS WE DERIVE OUR STANDARD HOW NUMEROUS AND VARIED ARE THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE CONSCIOUSLY SHARED
7957-39967-0018 HOW FULL AND FREE IS THE INTERPLAY WITH OTHER FORMS OF ASSOCIATION IF WE APPLY THESE CONSIDERATIONS TO SAY A CRIMINAL BAND WE FIND THAT THE TIES WHICH CONSCIOUSLY HOLD THE MEMBERS TOGETHER ARE FEW IN NUMBER
7957-39967-0019 REDUCIBLE ALMOST TO A COMMON INTEREST IN PLUNDER AND THAT THEY ARE OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO ISOLATE THE GROUP FROM OTHER GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO GIVE AND TAKE OF THE VALUES OF LIFE HENCE THE EDUCATION SUCH A SOCIETY GIVES IS PARTIAL AND DISTORTED
7957-39967-0020 IF WE TAKE ON THE OTHER HAND THE KIND OF FAMILY LIFE WHICH ILLUSTRATES THE STANDARD WE FIND THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL INTELLECTUAL AESTHETIC INTERESTS IN WHICH ALL PARTICIPATE AND THAT THE PROGRESS OF ONE MEMBER
7957-39967-0021 HAS WORTH FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER MEMBERS IT IS READILY COMMUNICABLE AND THAT THE FAMILY IS NOT AN ISOLATED WHOLE BUT ENTERS INTIMATELY INTO RELATIONSHIPS WITH BUSINESS GROUPS WITH SCHOOLS WITH ALL THE AGENCIES OF CULTURE AS WELL AS WITH OTHER SIMILAR GROUPS
7957-39967-0022 AND THAT IT PLAYS A DUE PART IN THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION AND IN RETURN RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM IT IN SHORT THERE ARE MANY INTERESTS CONSCIOUSLY COMMUNICATED AND SHARED AND THERE ARE VARIED AND FREE POINTS OF CONTACT WITH OTHER MODES OF ASSOCIATION
7957-39967-0023 LET US APPLY THE FIRST ELEMENT IN THIS CRITERION TO A DESPOTICALLY GOVERNED STATE IT IS NOT TRUE THERE IS NO COMMON INTEREST IN SUCH AN ORGANIZATION BETWEEN GOVERNED AND GOVERNORS
7957-39967-0024 THE AUTHORITIES IN COMMAND MUST MAKE SOME APPEAL TO THE NATIVE ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBJECTS MUST CALL SOME OF THEIR POWERS INTO PLAY TALLEYRAND SAID THAT A GOVERNMENT COULD DO EVERYTHING WITH BAYONETS EXCEPT SIT ON THEM
7957-39967-0025 THIS CYNICAL DECLARATION IS AT LEAST A RECOGNITION THAT THE BOND OF UNION IS NOT MERELY ONE OF COERCIVE FORCE IT MAY BE SAID HOWEVER THAT THE ACTIVITIES APPEALED TO ARE THEMSELVES UNWORTHY AND DEGRADING
7957-39967-0026 THAT SUCH A GOVERNMENT CALLS INTO FUNCTIONING ACTIVITY SIMPLY CAPACITY FOR FEAR IN A WAY THIS STATEMENT IS TRUE BUT IT OVERLOOKS THE FACT THAT FEAR NEED NOT BE AN UNDESIRABLE FACTOR IN EXPERIENCE CAUTION CIRCUMSPECTION
7957-39967-0027 PRUDENCE DESIRE TO FORESEE FUTURE EVENTS SO AS TO AVERT WHAT IS HARMFUL THESE DESIRABLE TRAITS ARE AS MUCH A PRODUCT OF CALLING THE IMPULSE OF FEAR INTO PLAY AS IS COWARDICE AND ABJECT SUBMISSION THE REAL DIFFICULTY IS THAT THE APPEAL TO FEAR IS ISOLATED
7957-39967-0028 IN EVOKING DREAD AND HOPE OF SPECIFIC TANGIBLE REWARD SAY COMFORT AND EASE MANY OTHER CAPACITIES ARE LEFT UNTOUCHED OR RATHER THEY ARE AFFECTED BUT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PERVERT THEM INSTEAD OF OPERATING ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT
7957-39967-0029 THEY ARE REDUCED TO MERE SERVANTS OF ATTAINING PLEASURE AND AVOIDING PAIN THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT THERE IS NO EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF COMMON INTERESTS THERE IS NO FREE PLAY BACK AND FORTH AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIAL GROUP STIMULATION AND RESPONSE ARE EXCEEDINGLY ONE SIDED
7957-39967-0030 IN ORDER TO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF VALUES IN COMMON ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP MUST HAVE AN EQUABLE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE AND TO TAKE FROM OTHERS THERE MUST BE A LARGE VARIETY OF SHARED UNDERTAKINGS AND EXPERIENCES OTHERWISE
7957-39967-0031 THE INFLUENCES WHICH EDUCATE SOME INTO MASTERS EDUCATE OTHERS INTO SLAVES AND THE EXPERIENCE OF EACH PARTY LOSES IN MEANING WHEN THE FREE INTERCHANGE OF VARYING MODES OF LIFE EXPERIENCE IS ARRESTED
7957-39967-0032 A SEPARATION INTO A PRIVILEGED AND A SUBJECT CLASS PREVENTS SOCIAL ENDOSMOSIS THE EVILS THEREBY AFFECTING THE SUPERIOR CLASS ARE LESS MATERIAL AND LESS PERCEPTIBLE BUT EQUALLY REAL THEIR CULTURE TENDS TO BE STERILE
7957-39967-0033 TO BE TURNED BACK TO FEED ON ITSELF THEIR ART BECOMES A SHOWY DISPLAY AND ARTIFICIAL THEIR WEALTH LUXURIOUS THEIR KNOWLEDGE OVERSPECIALIZED THEIR MANNERS FASTIDIOUS RATHER THAN HUMANE
7957-39967-0034 DIVERSITY OF STIMULATION MEANS NOVELTY AND NOVELTY MEANS CHALLENGE TO THOUGHT THE MORE ACTIVITY IS RESTRICTED TO A FEW DEFINITE LINES AS IT IS WHEN THERE ARE RIGID CLASS LINES PREVENTING ADEQUATE INTERPLAY OF EXPERIENCES
7957-39967-0035 THE MORE ACTION TENDS TO BECOME ROUTINE ON THE PART OF THE CLASS AT A DISADVANTAGE AND CAPRICIOUS AIMLESS AND EXPLOSIVE ON THE PART OF THE CLASS HAVING THE MATERIALLY FORTUNATE POSITION PLATO DEFINED A SLAVE AS ONE WHO ACCEPTS FROM ANOTHER THE PURPOSES WHICH CONTROL HIS CONDUCT
7957-39967-0036 THIS CONDITION OBTAINS EVEN WHERE THERE IS NO SLAVERY IN THE LEGAL SENSE IT IS FOUND WHEREVER MEN ARE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITY WHICH IS SOCIALLY SERVICEABLE BUT WHOSE SERVICE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND HAVE NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN
7957-39967-0037 MUCH IS SAID ABOUT SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT OF WORK IT IS A NARROW VIEW WHICH RESTRICTS THE SCIENCE WHICH SECURES EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION TO MOVEMENTS OF THE MUSCLES THE CHIEF OPPORTUNITY FOR SCIENCE IS THE DISCOVERY OF THE RELATIONS OF A MAN TO HIS WORK
7957-39967-0038 INCLUDING HIS RELATIONS TO OTHERS WHO TAKE PART WHICH WILL ENLIST HIS INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN WHAT HE IS DOING EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCTION OFTEN DEMANDS DIVISION OF LABOR BUT IT IS REDUCED TO A MECHANICAL ROUTINE UNLESS WORKERS SEE THE TECHNICAL INTELLECTUAL
7957-39967-0039 INVOLVED IN WHAT THEY DO AND ENGAGE IN THEIR WORK BECAUSE OF THE MOTIVATION FURNISHED BY SUCH PERCEPTIONS THE TENDENCY TO REDUCE SUCH THINGS AS EFFICIENCY OF ACTIVITY AND SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT TO PURELY TECHNICAL EXTERNALS IS EVIDENCE OF THE ONE SIDED STIMULATION OF THOUGHT
7957-39967-0040 GIVEN TO THOSE IN CONTROL OF INDUSTRY THOSE WHO SUPPLY ITS AIMS BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF ALL ROUND AND WELL BALANCED SOCIAL INTEREST THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT STIMULUS FOR ATTENTION TO THE HUMAN FACTORS AND RELATIONSHIPS IN INDUSTRY
7957-39967-0041 INTELLIGENCE IS NARROWED TO THE FACTORS CONCERNED WITH TECHNICAL PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF GOODS NO DOUBT A VERY ACUTE AND INTENSE INTELLIGENCE IN THESE NARROW LINES CAN BE DEVELOPED BUT THE FAILURE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL FACTORS
7957-39967-0042 MEANS NONE THE LESS AN ABSENCE OF MIND AND A CORRESPONDING DISTORTION OF EMOTIONAL LIFE
7957-39967-0043 THIS ILLUSTRATION WHOSE POINT IS TO BE EXTENDED TO ALL ASSOCIATIONS LACKING RECIPROCITY OF INTEREST BRINGS US TO OUR SECOND POINT
7957-39967-0044 BRINGS ITS ANTISOCIAL SPIRIT INTO RELIEF
7957-39967-0045 IT MARKS NATIONS IN THEIR ISOLATION FROM ONE ANOTHER FAMILIES WHICH SECLUDE THEIR DOMESTIC CONCERNS AS IF THEY HAD NO CONNECTION WITH A LARGER LIFE SCHOOLS WHEN SEPARATED FROM THE INTEREST OF HOME AND COMMUNITY THE DIVISIONS OF RICH AND POOR LEARNED AND UNLEARNED
7957-39967-0046 THE ESSENTIAL POINT IS THAT ISOLATION MAKES FOR RIGIDITY AND FORMAL INSTITUTIONALIZING OF LIFE FOR STATIC AND SELFISH IDEALS WITHIN THE GROUP THAT SAVAGE TRIBES REGARD ALIENS AND ENEMIES AS SYNONYMOUS IS NOT ACCIDENTAL
7957-39967-0047 IT SPRINGS FROM THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH RIGID ADHERENCE TO THEIR PAST CUSTOMS ON SUCH A BASIS IT IS WHOLLY LOGICAL TO FEAR INTERCOURSE WITH OTHERS FOR SUCH CONTACT MIGHT DISSOLVE CUSTOM IT WOULD CERTAINLY OCCASION RECONSTRUCTION
7957-39967-0048 IT IS A COMMONPLACE THAT AN ALERT AND EXPANDING MENTAL LIFE DEPENDS UPON AN ENLARGING RANGE OF CONTACT WITH THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT BUT THE PRINCIPLE APPLIES EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE FIELD WHERE WE ARE APT TO IGNORE IT THE SPHERE OF SOCIAL CONTACTS
7957-39967-0049 EVERY EXPANSIVE ERA IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND HAS COINCIDED WITH THE OPERATION OF FACTORS WHICH HAVE TENDED TO ELIMINATE DISTANCE BETWEEN PEOPLES AND CLASSES PREVIOUSLY HEMMED OFF FROM ONE ANOTHER EVEN THE ALLEGED BENEFITS OF WAR
7957-39967-0050 SPRING FROM THE FACT THAT CONFLICT OF PEOPLES AT LEAST ENFORCES INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THEM AND THUS ACCIDENTALLY ENABLES THEM TO LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER AND THEREBY TO EXPAND THEIR HORIZONS TRAVEL ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL TENDENCIES
7957-39967-0051 HAVE AT PRESENT GONE FAR TO BREAK DOWN EXTERNAL BARRIERS TO BRING PEOPLES AND CLASSES INTO CLOSER AND MORE PERCEPTIBLE CONNECTION WITH ONE ANOTHER IT REMAINS FOR THE MOST PART TO SECURE THE INTELLECTUAL AND EMOTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
7957-39967-0052 OF THIS PHYSICAL ANNIHILATION OF SPACE TWO THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL THE TWO ELEMENTS IN OUR CRITERION BOTH POINT TO DEMOCRACY
7957-39967-0053 THE FIRST SIGNIFIES NOT ONLY MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE VARIED POINTS OF SHARED COMMON INTEREST BUT GREATER RELIANCE UPON THE RECOGNITION OF MUTUAL INTERESTS AS A FACTOR IN SOCIAL CONTROL THE SECOND MEANS NOT ONLY FREER INTERACTION BETWEEN SOCIAL GROUPS
7957-39967-0054 ONCE ISOLATED SO FAR AS INTENTION COULD KEEP UP A SEPARATION BUT CHANGE IN SOCIAL HABIT ITS CONTINUOUS READJUSTMENT THROUGH MEETING THE NEW SITUATIONS PRODUCED BY VARIED INTERCOURSE
7957-39967-0055 AND THESE TWO TRAITS ARE PRECISELY WHAT CHARACTERIZE THE DEMOCRATICALLY CONSTITUTED SOCIETY UPON THE EDUCATIONAL SIDE WE NOTE FIRST THAT THE REALIZATION OF A FORM OF SOCIAL LIFE IN WHICH INTERESTS ARE MUTUALLY INTERPENETRATING
7957-39967-0056 AND WHERE PROGRESS OR READJUSTMENT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION MAKES A DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITY MORE INTERESTED THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE CAUSE TO BE IN DELIBERATE AND SYSTEMATIC EDUCATION THE DEVOTION OF DEMOCRACY TO EDUCATION IS A FAMILIAR FACT
7957-39967-0057 THE SUPERFICIAL EXPLANATION IS THAT A GOVERNMENT RESTING UPON POPULAR SUFFRAGE CANNOT BE SUCCESSFUL UNLESS THOSE WHO ELECT AND WHO OBEY THEIR GOVERNORS ARE EDUCATED SINCE A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY REPUDIATES THE PRINCIPLE OF EXTERNAL AUTHORITY
7957-39967-0058 IT MUST FIND A SUBSTITUTE IN VOLUNTARY DISPOSITION AND INTEREST THESE CAN BE CREATED ONLY BY EDUCATION BUT THERE IS A DEEPER EXPLANATION A DEMOCRACY IS MORE THAN A FORM OF GOVERNMENT IT IS PRIMARILY A MODE OF ASSOCIATED LIVING
7957-39967-0059 OF CONJOINT COMMUNICATED EXPERIENCE THE EXTENSION IN SPACE OF THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTEREST SO THAT EACH HAS TO REFER HIS OWN ACTION TO THAT OF OTHERS AND TO CONSIDER THE ACTION OF OTHERS TO GIVE POINT AND DIRECTION TO HIS OWN
7957-39967-0060 IS EQUIVALENT TO THE BREAKING DOWN OF THOSE BARRIERS OF CLASS RACE AND NATIONAL TERRITORY WHICH KEPT MEN FROM PERCEIVING THE FULL IMPORT OF THEIR ACTIVITY THESE MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE VARIED POINTS OF CONTACT
7957-39967-0061 THEY CONSEQUENTLY PUT A PREMIUM ON VARIATION IN HIS ACTION THEY SECURE A LIBERATION OF POWERS WHICH REMAIN SUPPRESSED AS LONG AS THE INCITATIONS TO ACTION ARE PARTIAL AS THEY MUST BE IN A GROUP WHICH IN ITS EXCLUSIVENESS SHUTS OUT MANY INTERESTS
7957-39967-0062 THE WIDENING OF THE AREA OF SHARED CONCERNS AND THE LIBERATION OF A GREATER DIVERSITY OF PERSONAL CAPACITIES WHICH CHARACTERIZE A DEMOCRACY ARE NOT OF COURSE THE PRODUCT OF DELIBERATION AND CONSCIOUS EFFORT ON THE CONTRARY
7957-39967-0063 THEY WERE CAUSED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODES OF MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCE TRAVEL MIGRATION AND INTERCOMMUNICATION WHICH FLOWED FROM THE COMMAND OF SCIENCE OVER NATURAL ENERGY BUT AFTER GREATER INDIVIDUALIZATION ON ONE HAND AND A BROADER COMMUNITY OF INTEREST ON THE OTHER HAVE COME INTO EXISTENCE
7957-39967-0064 OBVIOUSLY A SOCIETY TO WHICH STRATIFICATION INTO SEPARATE CLASSES WOULD BE FATAL MUST SEE TO IT THAT INTELLECTUAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL ON EQUABLE AND EASY TERMS
7957-39967-0065 A SOCIETY MARKED OFF INTO CLASSES NEED HE SPECIALLY ATTENTIVE ONLY TO THE EDUCATION OF ITS RULING ELEMENTS A SOCIETY WHICH IS MOBILE WHICH IS FULL OF CHANNELS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF A CHANGE OCCURRING ANYWHERE
7957-39967-0066 MUST SEE TO IT THAT ITS MEMBERS ARE EDUCATED TO PERSONAL INITIATIVE AND ADAPTABILITY OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY THE CHANGES IN WHICH THEY ARE CAUGHT AND WHOSE SIGNIFICANCE OR CONNECTIONS THEY DO NOT PERCEIVE
7957-39967-0067 THE RESULT WILL BE A CONFUSION IN WHICH A FEW WILL APPROPRIATE TO THEMSELVES THE RESULTS OF THE BLIND AND EXTERNALLY DIRECTED ACTIVITIES OF OTHERS THREE THE PLATONIC EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY
7957-39967-0068 SUBSEQUENT CHAPTERS WILL BE DEVOTED TO MAKING EXPLICIT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAS IN EDUCATION IN THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS CHAPTER WE SHALL CONSIDER THE EDUCATIONAL THEORIES WHICH HAVE BEEN EVOLVED IN THREE EPOCHS
7957-39967-0069 WHEN THE SOCIAL IMPORT OF EDUCATION WAS ESPECIALLY CONSPICUOUS THE FIRST ONE TO BE CONSIDERED IS THAT OF PLATO
7957-39967-0070 NO ONE COULD BETTER EXPRESS THAN DID HE THE FACT THAT A SOCIETY IS STABLY ORGANIZED WHEN EACH INDIVIDUAL IS DOING THAT FOR WHICH HE HAS APTITUDE BY NATURE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BE USEFUL TO OTHERS OR TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WHOLE TO WHICH HE BELONGS
7957-39967-0071 AND THAT IT IS THE BUSINESS OF EDUCATION TO DISCOVER THESE APTITUDES AND PROGRESSIVELY TO TRAIN THEM FOR SOCIAL USE MUCH WHICH HAS BEEN SAID SO FAR IS BORROWED FROM WHAT PLATO FIRST CONSCIOUSLY TAUGHT THE WORLD
7957-39967-0072 BUT CONDITIONS WHICH HE COULD NOT INTELLECTUALLY CONTROL LED HIM TO RESTRICT THESE IDEAS IN THEIR APPLICATION HE NEVER GOT ANY CONCEPTION OF THE INDEFINITE PLURALITY OF ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY CHARACTERIZE AN INDIVIDUAL AND A SOCIAL GROUP
7957-39967-0073 PLATO'S STARTING POINT IS THAT THE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY DEPENDS ULTIMATELY UPON KNOWLEDGE OF THE END OF EXISTENCE IF WE DO NOT KNOW ITS END WE SHALL BE AT THE MERCY OF ACCIDENT AND CAPRICE UNLESS WE KNOW THE END THE GOOD
7957-39967-0074 WE SHALL HAVE NO CRITERION FOR RATIONALLY DECIDING WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE WHICH SHOULD BE PROMOTED NOR HOW SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE TO BE ORDERED WE SHALL HAVE NO CONCEPTION OF THE PROPER LIMITS AND DISTRIBUTION OF ACTIVITIES WHAT HE CALLED JUSTICE
7957-39967-0075 AS A TRAIT OF BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BUT HOW IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FINAL AND PERMANENT GOOD TO BE ACHIEVED IN DEALING WITH THIS QUESTION WE COME UPON THE SEEMINGLY INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE
7957-39967-0076 THAT SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS NOT POSSIBLE SAVE IN A JUST AND HARMONIOUS SOCIAL ORDER EVERYWHERE ELSE THE MIND IS DISTRACTED AND MISLED BY FALSE VALUATIONS AND FALSE PERSPECTIVES
7957-39967-0077 A DISORGANIZED AND FACTIONAL SOCIETY SETS UP A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MODELS AND STANDARDS UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO ATTAIN CONSISTENCY OF MIND ONLY A COMPLETE WHOLE IS FULLY SELF CONSISTENT
7957-39967-0078 A SOCIETY WHICH RESTS UPON THE SUPREMACY OF SOME FACTOR OVER ANOTHER IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS RATIONAL OR PROPORTIONATE CLAIMS INEVITABLY LEADS THOUGHT ASTRAY IT PUTS A PREMIUM ON CERTAIN THINGS AND SLURS OVER OTHERS
7957-39967-0079 AND CREATES A MIND WHOSE SEEMING UNITY IS FORCED AND DISTORTED EDUCATION PROCEEDS ULTIMATELY FROM THE PATTERNS FURNISHED BY INSTITUTIONS CUSTOMS AND LAWS ONLY IN A JUST STATE WILL THESE BE SUCH AS TO GIVE THE RIGHT EDUCATION
7957-39967-0080 AND ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE RIGHTLY TRAINED MINDS WILL BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE END AND ORDERING PRINCIPLE OF THINGS WE SEEM TO BE CAUGHT IN A HOPELESS CIRCLE HOWEVER PLATO SUGGESTED A WAY OUT
7957-39967-0081 A FEW MEN PHILOSOPHERS OR LOVERS OF WISDOM OR TRUTH MAY BY STUDY LEARN AT LEAST IN OUTLINE THE PROPER PATTERNS OF TRUE EXISTENCE IF A POWERFUL RULER SHOULD FORM A STATE AFTER THESE PATTERNS THEN ITS REGULATIONS COULD BE PRESERVED
7957-39967-0082 AN EDUCATION COULD BE GIVEN WHICH WOULD SIFT INDIVIDUALS DISCOVERING WHAT THEY WERE GOOD FOR AND SUPPLYING A METHOD OF ASSIGNING EACH TO THE WORK IN LIFE FOR WHICH HIS NATURE FITS HIM EACH DOING HIS OWN PART AND NEVER TRANSGRESSING
7957-39967-0083 THE ORDER AND UNITY OF THE WHOLE WOULD BE MAINTAINED IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN ANY SCHEME OF PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHT A MORE ADEQUATE RECOGNITION ON ONE HAND OF THE EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ON THE OTHER
7957-39967-0084 OF THE DEPENDENCE OF THOSE ARRANGEMENTS UPON THE MEANS USED TO EDUCATE THE YOUNG IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A DEEPER SENSE OF THE FUNCTION OF EDUCATION IN DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING PERSONAL CAPACITIES AND TRAINING THEM SO THAT THEY WOULD CONNECT WITH THE ACTIVITIES OF OTHERS
7957-39967-0085 YET THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THE THEORY WAS PROPOUNDED WAS SO UNDEMOCRATIC THAT PLATO COULD NOT WORK OUT A SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM WHOSE TERMS HE CLEARLY SAW
7957-39967-0086 WHILE HE AFFIRMED WITH EMPHASIS THAT THE PLACE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN SOCIETY SHOULD NOT BE DETERMINED BY BIRTH OR WEALTH OR ANY CONVENTIONAL STATUS BUT BY HIS OWN NATURE AS DISCOVERED IN THE PROCESS OF EDUCATION
7957-39967-0087 HE HAD NO PERCEPTION OF THE UNIQUENESS OF INDIVIDUALS FOR HIM THEY FALL BY NATURE INTO CLASSES AND INTO A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF CLASSES AT THAT CONSEQUENTLY THE TESTING AND SIFTING FUNCTION OF EDUCATION
7957-39967-0088 THERE BEING NO RECOGNITION THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTES HIS OWN CLASS THERE COULD BE NO RECOGNITION OF THE INFINITE DIVERSITY OF ACTIVE TENDENCIES AND COMBINATIONS OF TENDENCIES OF WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL IS CAPABLE
7957-39967-0089 THERE WERE ONLY THREE TYPES OF FACULTIES OR POWERS IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S CONSTITUTION HENCE EDUCATION WOULD SOON REACH A STATIC LIMIT IN EACH CLASS
7957-39967-0090 IN SOME INDIVIDUALS APPETITES NATURALLY DOMINATE THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO THE LABORING AND TRADING CLASS WHICH EXPRESSES AND SUPPLIES HUMAN WANTS OTHERS REVEAL UPON EDUCATION
7957-39967-0091 THAT OVER AND ABOVE APPETITES THEY HAVE A GENEROUS OUTGOING ASSERTIVELY COURAGEOUS DISPOSITION THEY BECOME THE CITIZEN SUBJECTS OF THE STATE ITS DEFENDERS IN WAR ITS INTERNAL GUARDIANS IN PEACE BUT THEIR LIMIT IS FIXED BY THEIR LACK OF REASON
7957-39967-0092 WHICH IS A CAPACITY TO GRASP THE UNIVERSAL THOSE WHO POSSESS THIS ARE CAPABLE OF THE HIGHEST KIND OF EDUCATION AND BECOME IN TIME THE LEGISLATORS OF THE STATE FOR LAWS ARE THE UNIVERSALS WHICH CONTROL THE PARTICULARS OF EXPERIENCE
7957-39967-0093 THUS IT IS NOT TRUE THAT IN INTENT PLATO SUBORDINATED THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE SOCIAL WHOLE BUT IT IS TRUE THAT LACKING THE PERCEPTION OF THE UNIQUENESS OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL HIS INCOMMENSURABILITY WITH OTHERS
7957-39967-0094 AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT RECOGNIZING THAT A SOCIETY MIGHT CHANGE AND YET BE STABLE HIS DOCTRINE OF LIMITED POWERS AND CLASSES CAME IN NET EFFECT TO THE IDEA OF THE SUBORDINATION OF INDIVIDUALITY
