176-123269-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN BOLDLY DOWN THE CRATER
176-123269-0001 THE BED WAS HARD THE SHELTER NOT VERY SUBSTANTIAL
176-123269-0002 I ROSE FROM MY GRANITE BED AND WENT OUT TO ENJOY THE MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE THAT LAY UNROLLED BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE SOUTHERNMOST OF SNAEFELL'S PEAKS THE RANGE OF THE EYE EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE ISLAND
176-123269-0003 BY AN OPTICAL LAW WHICH OBTAINS AT ALL GREAT HEIGHTS THE SHORES SEEMED RAISED AND THE CENTRE DEPRESSED IT SEEMED AS IF ONE OF HELBESMER'S RAISED MAPS LAY AT MY FEET
176-123269-0004 PRECIPICES LIKE LOW WALLS LAKES REDUCED TO PONDS RIVERS ABBREVIATED INTO STREAMS ON MY RIGHT WERE NUMBERLESS GLACIERS AND INNUMERABLE PEAKS SOME PLUMED WITH FEATHERY CLOUDS OF SMOKE
176-123269-0005 THE UNDULATING SURFACE OF THESE ENDLESS MOUNTAINS CRESTED WITH SHEETS OF SNOW REMINDED ONE OF A STORMY SEA IF I LOOKED WESTWARD THERE THE OCEAN LAY SPREAD OUT IN ALL ITS MAGNIFICENCE
176-123269-0006 LIKE A MERE CONTINUATION OF THOSE FLOCK LIKE SUMMITS THE EYE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE THE SNOWY RIDGES ENDED AND THE FOAMING WAVES BEGAN I WAS THUS STEEPED IN THE MARVELLOUS ECSTASY WHICH ALL HIGH SUMMITS DEVELOP IN THE MIND
176-123269-0007 THE FANCIFUL CREATION OF SCANDINAVIAN SUPERSTITIONS I FELT INTOXICATED WITH THE SUBLIME PLEASURE OF LOFTY ELEVATIONS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE PROFOUND ABYSSES INTO WHICH I WAS SHORTLY TO BE PLUNGED
176-123269-0008 BUT I WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE REALITIES OF THINGS BY THE ARRIVAL OF HANS AND THE PROFESSOR WHO JOINED ME ON THE SUMMIT MY UNCLE POINTED OUT TO ME IN THE FAR WEST A LIGHT STEAM OR MIST A SEMBLANCE OF LAND WHICH BOUNDED THE DISTANT HORIZON OF WATERS
176-123269-0009 GREENLAND SAID HE GREENLAND I CRIED YES
176-123269-0010 AND DURING THAWS THE WHITE BEARS
176-123269-0011 ARE CARRIED EVEN INTO ICELAND
176-123269-0012 HERE WE ARE AT THE TOP OF SNAEFELL AND HERE ARE TWO PEAKS
176-123269-0013 THE QUESTION BEING PUT HANS REPLIED SCARTARIS MY UNCLE SHOT A TRIUMPHANT GLANCE AT ME NOW FOR THE CRATER HE CRIED THE CRATER OF SNAEFELL RESEMBLED AN INVERTED CONE THE OPENING OF WHICH MIGHT BE HALF A LEAGUE IN DIAMETER
176-123269-0014 ITS DEPTH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET IMAGINE THE ASPECT OF SUCH A RESERVOIR BRIM FULL AND RUNNING OVER WITH LIQUID FIRE AMID THE ROLLING THUNDER THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FEET IN CIRCUIT
176-123269-0015 SO THAT THE GENTLE SLOPE ALLOWED ITS LOWER BRIM TO BE REACHED WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY INVOLUNTARILY I COMPARED THE WHOLE CRATER TO AN ENORMOUS ERECTED MORTAR AND THE COMPARISON PUT ME IN A TERRIBLE FRIGHT WHAT MADNESS I THOUGHT
176-123269-0016 TO GO DOWN INTO A MORTAR PERHAPS A LOADED MORTAR TO BE SHOT UP INTO THE AIR AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
176-123269-0017 RUSHED BOUNDING DOWN THE ABYSS AND IN THEIR FALL AWOKE ECHOES REMARKABLE FOR THEIR LOUD AND WELL DEFINED SHARPNESS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CONE THERE WERE GLACIERS HERE HANS ADVANCED ONLY WITH EXTREME PRECAUTION
176-123269-0018 SOUNDING HIS WAY WITH HIS IRON POINTED POLE TO DISCOVER ANY CREVASSES IN IT
176-123269-0019 IN ORDER THAT ANY MAN WHO MISSED HIS FOOTING MIGHT BE HELD UP BY HIS COMPANIONS THIS SOLID FORMATION WAS PRUDENT BUT DID NOT REMOVE ALL DANGER YET NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DESCENT DOWN STEEPS UNKNOWN TO THE GUIDE
176-123269-0020 I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW STRAIGHT ABOVE ME THE UPPER APERTURE OF THE CONE FRAMING A BIT OF SKY OF VERY SMALL CIRCUMFERENCE BUT ALMOST PERFECTLY ROUND
176-123269-0021 I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO LOOK DOWN EITHER OF THEM BUT PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAD HASTILY SURVEYED ALL THREE HE WAS PANTING RUNNING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER GESTICULATING AND UTTERING INCOHERENT EXPRESSIONS HANS AND HIS COMRADES
176-123269-0022 SEATED UPON LOOSE LAVA ROCKS LOOKED AT HIM WITH AS MUCH WONDER AS THEY KNEW HOW TO EXPRESS AND PERHAPS TAKING HIM FOR AN ESCAPED LUNATIC SUDDENLY MY UNCLE UTTERED A CRY I THOUGHT HIS FOOT MUST HAVE SLIPPED AND THAT HE HAD FALLEN DOWN ONE OF THE HOLES
176-123269-0023 BUT NO I SAW HIM WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND LEGS STRADDLING WIDE APART ERECT BEFORE A GRANITE ROCK THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE CRATER JUST LIKE A PEDESTAL MADE READY TO RECEIVE A STATUE OF PLUTO
176-123269-0024 HANS AND THE ICELANDERS NEVER STIRRED
176-123269-0025 CRIED THE PROFESSOR AND SHARING HIS ASTONISHMENT BUT I THINK NOT HIS JOY I READ ON THE WESTERN FACE OF THE BLOCK IN RUNIC CHARACTERS HALF MOULDERED AWAY WITH LAPSE OF AGES
176-123269-0026 AT THIS POINT A RUNIC TEXT APPEARS
176-123269-0027 THAT ON RAISING MY HEAD AGAIN I SAW ONLY MY UNCLE AND HANS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER THE ICELANDERS HAD BEEN DISMISSED
176-123269-0028 HANS SLEPT PEACEABLY AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK IN A LAVA BED WHERE HE HAD FOUND A SUITABLE COUCH FOR HIMSELF BUT MY UNCLE WAS PACING AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE I HAD NEITHER THE WISH NOR THE STRENGTH TO RISE
176-123269-0029 THE NEXT MORNING A GREY HEAVY CLOUDY SKY SEEMED TO DROOP OVER THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE I DID NOT KNOW THIS FIRST FROM THE APPEARANCES OF NATURE BUT I FOUND IT OUT BY MY UNCLE'S IMPETUOUS WRATH
176-123269-0030 I SOON FOUND OUT THE CAUSE AND HOPE DAWNED AGAIN IN MY HEART FOR THIS REASON OF THE THREE WAYS OPEN BEFORE US ONE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SAKNUSSEMM THE INDICATIONS OF THE LEARNED ICELANDER HINTED AT IN THE CRYPTOGRAM
176-123269-0031 POINTED TO THIS FACT THAT THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS CAME TO TOUCH THAT PARTICULAR WAY DURING THE LATTER DAYS OF THE MONTH OF JUNE THAT SHARP PEAK MIGHT HENCE BE CONSIDERED AS THE GNOMON OF A VAST SUN DIAL
176-123269-0032 THE SHADOW PROJECTED FROM WHICH ON A CERTAIN DAY WOULD POINT OUT THE ROAD TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH NOW NO SUN NO SHADOW AND THEREFORE NO GUIDE HERE WAS JUNE TWENTY FIFTH
176-123269-0033 IF THE SUN WAS CLOUDED FOR SIX DAYS WE MUST POSTPONE OUR VISIT TILL NEXT YEAR MY LIMITED POWERS OF DESCRIPTION WOULD FAIL WERE I TO ATTEMPT A PICTURE OF THE PROFESSOR'S ANGRY IMPATIENCE
176-123269-0034 THE DAY WORE ON AND NO SHADOW CAME TO LAY ITSELF ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER HANS DID NOT MOVE FROM THE SPOT HE HAD SELECTED YET HE MUST BE ASKING HIMSELF WHAT WERE WE WAITING FOR IF HE ASKED HIMSELF ANYTHING AT ALL
176-123269-0035 HANS BUILT A HUT OF PIECES OF LAVA I FELT A MALICIOUS PLEASURE IN WATCHING THE THOUSAND RILLS AND CASCADES THAT CAME TUMBLING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE CONE
176-123269-0036 MY UNCLE'S RAGE KNEW NO BOUNDS IT WAS ENOUGH TO IRRITATE A MEEKER MAN THAN HE FOR IT WAS FOUNDERING ALMOST WITHIN THE PORT BUT HEAVEN NEVER SENDS UNMIXED GRIEF
176-123269-0037 AND FOR PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK THERE WAS A SATISFACTION IN STORE PROPORTIONED TO HIS DESPERATE ANXIETIES
176-123269-0038 BUT ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF JUNE THE LAST DAY BUT ONE OF THE MONTH WITH THE CHANGE OF THE MOON CAME A CHANGE OF WEATHER THE SUN POURED A FLOOD OF LIGHT DOWN THE CRATER EVERY HILLOCK
176-123269-0039 MY UNCLE TURNED TOO AND FOLLOWED IT AT NOON BEING AT ITS LEAST EXTENT IT CAME AND SOFTLY FELL UPON THE EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CHIMNEY THERE IT IS
