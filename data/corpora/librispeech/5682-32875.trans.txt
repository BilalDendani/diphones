5682-32875-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY CAPTAIN LAKE TAKES AN EVENING STROLL ABOUT GYLINGDEN AGAIN I HAD SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF REMOVING MY PERSON AND EFFECTS TO THE BRANDON ARMS
5682-32875-0001 BUT NEITHER WAS I QUITE SATISFIED THAT THE THING WAS ALTOGETHER CANNY THE APPARITION WHATEVER IT WAS SEEMED TO PERSECUTE ME WITH A MYSTERIOUS OBSTINACY
5682-32875-0002 WHICH WAS PLAGUED WITH ITS PRESENCE AT THE SAME TIME I HAD AN ODD SORT OF RELUCTANCE TO MENTION THE SUBJECT TO MY ENTERTAINERS THE THING ITSELF WAS A GHOSTLY SLUR UPON THE HOUSE AND TO RUN AWAY A REPROACH TO MY MANHOOD AND BESIDES WRITING NOW AT A DISTANCE
5682-32875-0003 AND IN THE SPIRIT OF HISTORY I SUSPECT THE INTEREST WHICH BEAUTY ALWAYS EXCITES HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH MY RESOLVE TO HOLD MY GROUND AND I DARE SAY NOTWITHSTANDING MY OTHER REASONS HAD THE LADIES AT THE HALL BEEN ALL EITHER OLD OR UGLY
5682-32875-0004 AS IT WAS HOWEVER I WAS RESOLVED TO MAINTAIN MY POSITION BUT THAT EVENING WAS STREAKED WITH A TINGE OF HORROR AND I MORE SILENT AND DISTRAIT
5682-32875-0005 EVEN THOUGH THE OWNER BE NOTHING VERY REMARKABLE IS ALWAYS FELT
5682-32875-0006 NOT VERY MUCH REGRETTED FOR THE FIRST TIME WE WERE REALLY A SMALL PARTY MISS LAKE WAS NOT THERE THE GALLANT CAPTAIN HER BROTHER WAS ALSO ABSENT THE VICAR AND HIS GOOD LITTLE WIFE WERE AT NAUNTON THAT EVENING
5682-32875-0007 TO HEAR A MISSIONARY RECOUNT HIS ADVENTURES AND EXPERIENCES IN JAPAN AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS HAD BEEN CALLED IN TO FILL THE EMPTY CHAIRS
5682-32875-0008 IN TRUTH DID I OLD LADY CHELFORD OCCASIONALLY DOZED AND NODDED STERNLY AFTER TEA WAKING UP AND EYEING PEOPLE GRIMLY AS THOUGH ENQUIRING WHETHER ANYONE PRESUMED TO SUSPECT HER LADYSHIP OF HAVING HAD A NAP CHELFORD I RECOLLECT TOOK A BOOK
5682-32875-0009 AND READ TO US NOW AND THEN A SNATCH OF POETRY I FORGET WHAT MY BOOK EXCEPT WHEN I WAS THINKING OF THE TARN AND THAT OLD MAN I SO HATED WAS MISS BRANDON'S EXQUISITE AND MYSTERIOUS FACE THAT YOUNG LADY WAS LEANING BACK IN HER GREAT OAK CHAIR
5682-32875-0010 IN WHICH SHE LOOKED LIKE THE HEROINE OF SOME SAD AND GORGEOUS ROMANCE OF THE OLD CIVIL WARS OF ENGLAND AND DIRECTING A GAZE OF CONTEMPLATIVE AND HAUGHTY CURIOSITY UPON THE OLD LADY WHO WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DARING PROFANATION
5682-32875-0011 ALL ON A SUDDEN DORCAS BRANDON SAID AND PRAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MARRIAGE LADY CHELFORD WHAT DO I THINK OF MARRIAGE REPEATED THE DOWAGER THROWING BACK HER HEAD AND EYEING THE BEAUTIFUL HEIRESS THROUGH HER GOLD SPECTACLES WITH A STONY SURPRISE
5682-32875-0012 FOR SHE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE CATECHISED BY YOUNG PEOPLE MARRIAGE WHY TIS A DIVINE INSTITUTION WHAT CAN THE CHILD MEAN
5682-32875-0013 IT MAY BE SAFELY CONTRACTED SOLELY TO JOIN TWO ESTATES PURSUED THE YOUNG LADY DO I THINK IT MAY SAFELY BE CONTRACTED SOLELY TO JOIN TWO ESTATES REPEATED THE OLD LADY WITH A LOOK AND CARRIAGE THAT PLAINLY SHOWED
5682-32875-0014 HOW ENTIRELY SHE APPRECIATED THE AMAZING PRESUMPTION OF HER INTERROGATRIX THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE CERTAINLY REPLIED LADY CHELFORD
5682-32875-0015 THAT IS OF COURSE UNDER PROPER CONDITIONS AND WITH A DUE SENSE OF ITS SACRED CHARACTER AND A A OBLIGATIONS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS LOVE CONTINUED MISS BRANDON THE SECOND HONOUR
5682-32875-0016 BOTH INVOLUNTARY AND THE THIRD OBEDIENCE WHICH SPRINGS FROM THEM OLD LADY CHELFORD COUGHED AND THEN RALLYING SAID VERY GOOD MISS
5682-32875-0017 I DON'T SEE MISS BRANDON THAT MY THOUGHTS UPON THAT SUBJECT CAN CONCERN ANYONE BUT MYSELF RETORTED THE OLD LADY SEVERELY AND FROM AN AWFUL ALTITUDE
5682-32875-0018 AND MY YEARS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH I AM USUALLY TREATED I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE TONE IN WHICH YOU ARE PLEASED TO QUESTION ME THESE LAST TERRIBLE REMARKS TOTALLY FAILED TO OVERAWE THE SERENE TEMERITY OF THE GRAVE BEAUTY
5682-32875-0019 I ASSUMED LADY CHELFORD AS YOU HAD INTERESTED YOURSELF IN ME SO FAR AS TO ORIGINATE THE IDEA OF MY ENGAGEMENT TO MISTER WYLDER THAT YOU HAD CONSIDERED THESE TO ME VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS A LITTLE
5682-32875-0020 AND COULD GIVE ME SATISFACTORY ANSWERS UPON POINTS ON WHICH MY MIND HAS BEEN EMPLOYED FOR SOME DAYS AND INDEED I THINK I'VE A RIGHT TO ASK THAT ASSISTANCE OF YOU YOU SEEM TO FORGET YOUNG LADY THAT THERE ARE TIMES AND PLACES FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS
5682-32875-0021 AND THAT TO MISTER A A YOUR VISITOR A GLANCE AT ME IT CAN'T BE VERY INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO THIS KIND OF OF CONVERSATION WHICH IS NEITHER VERY ENTERTAINING NOR VERY WISE I AM ANSWERABLE ONLY FOR MY PART
5682-32875-0022 OF IT AND I THINK MY QUESTIONS VERY MUCH TO THE PURPOSE SAID THE YOUNG LADY IN HER LOW SILVERY TONES I DON'T QUESTION YOUR GOOD OPINION MISS BRANDON OF YOUR OWN DISCRETION BUT I CAN'T SEE ANY PROFIT IN
5682-32875-0023 NOW DISCUSSING AN ENGAGEMENT OF MORE THAN TWO MONTHS STANDING OR A MARRIAGE WHICH IS FIXED TO TAKE PLACE ONLY TEN DAYS HENCE AND I THINK SIR GLANCING AGAIN AT ME IT MUST STRIKE YOU A LITTLE ODDLY
5682-32875-0024 NOW WAS IT FAIR TO CALL A PEACEABLE INHABITANT LIKE ME INTO THE THICK OF A FRAY LIKE THIS I PAUSED LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW MISS BRANDON TO SPEAK BUT SHE DID NOT CHOOSE TO DO SO THINKING I SUPPOSE IT WAS MY BUSINESS
5682-32875-0025 I BELIEVE I OUGHT TO HAVE WITHDRAWN A LITTLE I SAID VERY HUMBLY AND OLD LADY CHELFORD AT THE WORD SHOT A GLEAM OF CONTEMPTUOUS TRIUMPH AT MISS DORCAS
5682-32875-0026 IN DEFERENCE TO YOU WHO ARE NOT AWARE AS MISS BRANDON IS THAT I AM ONE OF MISTER WYLDER'S OLDEST AND MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS AND AT HIS REQUEST AND WITH LORD CHELFORD'S APPROVAL
5682-32875-0027 BUT THERE IS NOTHING WHICH EITHER SHE OR I MAY SAY WHICH I WISH TO CONCEAL FROM ANY FRIEND OF MISTER WYLDER'S THE IDEA OF MISS BRANDON'S SERIOUSLY THINKING OF WITHDRAWING FROM HER ENGAGEMENT WITH MARK WYLDER I CONFESS NEVER ENTERED MY MIND
5682-32875-0028 BUT THE YOUNG LADY SHOWED NO SIGN OF EXCITEMENT AND LAY BACK IN HER CHAIR IN HER USUAL DEEP COLD CALM LAKE'S LATE SMOKING WITH WYLDER MUST HAVE DISAGREED WITH HIM VERY MUCH INDEED
5682-32875-0029 MORE OUT OF SORTS AS NIGHT APPROACHED HE STOLE AWAY FROM MISTER LARKIN'S TRELLISED PORCH IN THE DUSK HE MARCHED INTO THE TOWN RATHER QUICKLY LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BUSINESS ON HIS HANDS
5682-32875-0030 BUT HE HAD NONE FOR HE WALKED BY THE BRANDON ARMS AND HALTED AND STARED AT THE POST OFFICE AS IF HE FANCIED HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY THERE BUT NO THERE WAS NO NEED TO TAP AT THE WOODEN WINDOW PANE
5682-32875-0031 SOME IDLE BOYS WERE OBSERVING THE DANDY CAPTAIN AND HE TURNED DOWN
5682-32875-0032 ON THE COMMON AND SAUNTERED UPON THE SHORT GRASS
5682-32875-0033 OR TWO FOR GYLINGDEN BOASTS A SPA' WERE LOUNGING AWAY THE TWILIGHT HALF HOURS THERE HE SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE OF THE RUSTIC SEATS AND HIS YELLOW EYES WANDERED RESTLESSLY AND VAGUELY
5682-32875-0034 THEN FOR NEARLY TEN MINUTES HE SMOKED AN ODD RECREATION FOR A MAN SUFFERING FROM THE CIGARS OF LAST NIGHT AND AFTER THAT FOR NEARLY AS LONG AGAIN HE SEEMED LOST IN DEEP THOUGHT HIS EYES UPON THE MISTY GRASS BEFORE HIM AND HIS SMALL FRENCH
5682-32875-0035 BOOT BEATING TIME TO THE MUSIC OF HIS THOUGHTS SEVERAL GROUPS PASSED CLOSE BY HIM IN THEIR PLEASANT CIRCUIT SOME WONDERED WHAT MIGHT BE THE DISEASE OF THAT PALE PEEVISH LOOKING GENTLEMAN WHO SAT THERE SO STILL
5682-32875-0036 LANGUID AND DEJECTED OTHERS SET HIM DOWN AS A GENTLEMAN IN DIFFICULTIES OF SOME SORT WHO WAS USING GYLINGDEN FOR A TEMPORARY REFUGE OTHERS AGAIN SUPPOSED HE MIGHT BE THAT MAJOR CRADDOCK
5682-32875-0037 WHO HAD LOST THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS ON VANDERDECKEN THE OTHER DAY
5682-32875-0038 AT DISADVANTAGE AND REMARKED THAT SOME OF MISTER LARKIN'S CLIENTS LOOKED ALWAYS UNHAPPY THOUGH THEY HAD SO GODLY AN ATTORNEY TO DEAL WITH WHEN LAKE WITH A LITTLE SHUDDER FOR IT WAS GROWING CHILL
5682-32875-0039 LIFTED UP HIS YELLOW EYES SUDDENLY AND RECOLLECTED WHERE HE WAS THE COMMON HAD GROWN DARK AND WAS QUITE DESERTED
5682-32875-0040 AND IN THE BILLIARD ROOM BENEATH IT AND SHADOWY FIGURES WITH CUES IN THEIR HANDS GLIDING HITHER AND THITHER ACROSS ITS UNCURTAINED WINDOWS WITH A SHRUG AND A STEALTHY GLANCE ROUND HIM
5682-32875-0041 CAPTAIN LAKE STARTED UP THE INSTINCT
5682-32875-0042 AND THE SCORE CALLED BY THE MARKER AND ENTERED THE HOT GLARING ROOM OLD MAJOR JACKSON WITH HIS GLASS IN HIS EYE WAS CONTENDING IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES HEROICALLY WITH A MANCHESTER BAG MAN WHO WAS PALPABLY TOO MUCH FOR HIM
5682-32875-0043 THE DOUBLE CHINNED AND FLORID PROPRIETOR OF THE BRANDON ARMS WITH A BRANDY AND WATER FAMILIARITY OFFERED CAPTAIN LAKE TWO
5682-32875-0044 AND CLACK OF TONGUES THAT FOLLOWED THE CLOSE OF THE GAME CAPTAIN LAKE GLARED ROUND FOR A MOMENT LIKE A MAN CALLED UP FROM SLEEP THE NOISE RATTLED AND ROARED IN HIS EARS THE TALK SOUNDED MADLY AND THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE EXCITED AND MENACED
5682-32875-0045 HIM UNDEFINABLY AND HE FELT AS IF HE WAS ON THE POINT OF STARTING TO HIS FEET AND STAMPING AND SHOUTING THE FACT IS I SUPPOSE HE WAS CONFOUNDEDLY NERVOUS
5682-32875-0046 DYSPEPTIC OR WHATEVER ELSE IT MIGHT BE AND THE HEAT AND GLARE WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM SO OUT HE WENT INTO THE CHILL FRESH NIGHT AIR AND ROUND THE CORNER INTO THE QUAINT MAIN STREET OF GYLINGDEN AND WALKED DOWN
5682-32875-0047 AND THEN BACK AGAIN AND SO ON TRYING TO TIRE HIMSELF I THINK AND EVERY TIME HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET WITH HIS FACE TOWARD LONDON HIS YELLOW EYES GLEAMED THROUGH THE DARK AIR WITH THE FIXED GAZE OF A MAN LOOKING OUT FOR THE APPEARANCE OF A VEHICLE
5682-32875-0048 IT PERHAPS INDICATED AN ANXIETY AND A MENTAL LOOK OUT IN THAT DIRECTION FOR HE REALLY EXPECTED NO SUCH THING
5682-32875-0049 AND A NEWSPAPER IN THE COFFEE ROOM
5682-32875-0050 LODGE IT WAS CALLED AND ENTERED MISTER LARKIN'S DRAWING ROOM VERY CHEERFULLY HOW QUIET YOU ARE HERE SAID THE CAPTAIN I HAVE BEEN AWFULLY DISSIPATED SINCE I SAW YOU IN AN INNOCENT WAY MY DEAR CAPTAIN LAKE YOU MEAN OF COURSE IN AN INNOCENT WAY
5682-32875-0051 BUT FOR A RESIDENT HERE PUTTING ASIDE OTHER FEELINGS A RESIDENT HOLDING A POSITION IT WOULD NOT DO I ASSURE YOU THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WHOM ONE COULD NOT ASSOCIATE WITH COMFORTABLY I DON'T CARE I HOPE HOW POOR A MAN MAY BE
5682-32875-0052 AND HIS GRANDFATHER HE DID NOT CARE TO ENQUIRE AFTER AND WHO HAS HAD THE EDUCATION OF ONE DOES NOT FEEL HIMSELF AT HOME YOU KNOW I'M SURE YOU HAVE FELT THE SAME SORT OF THING YOURSELF OH OF COURSE
5682-32875-0053 AND I HAD SUCH A NICE WALK ON THE COMMON FIRST AND THEN A TURN UP AND DOWN BEFORE THE BRANDON ARMS WHERE AT LAST I READ A PAPER AND COULD NOT RESIST A GLASS OF BRANDY AND WATER AND GROWING LAZY CAME HOME IN A FLY
5682-32875-0054 SO I THINK I HAVE HAD A VERY GAY EVENING LARKIN SMILED
5682-32875-0055 WELL THEN IF YOU PERMIT ME BEING A LITTLE TIRED I'LL GO TO MY BED ROOM WITH A GRAVE AND AFFECTIONATE INTEREST MISTER LARKIN LOOKED IN HIS FACE AND SIGHED A LITTLE AND SAID MIGHT I PERHAPS VENTURE TO BEG JUST THIS ONE NIGHT
5682-32875-0056 THAT CHASTENED AND ENTREATING LOOK IT WAS HARD TO RESIST BUT SOMEHOW THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO LAKE TO SAY DO ALLOW ME THIS ONCE TO PRESCRIBE DO GIVE YOUR POOR SOUL THIS ONE CHANCE AND LAKE ANSWERED HIM
