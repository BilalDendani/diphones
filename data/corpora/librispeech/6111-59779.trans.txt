6111-59779-0000 WHAT TO THINK IN ORDER TO SEVER ALL MENTAL RELATIONS WITH DISEASE YOU MUST ENTER INTO MENTAL RELATIONS WITH HEALTH MAKING THE PROCESS POSITIVE NOT NEGATIVE
6111-59779-0001 ONE OF ASSUMPTION NOT OF REJECTION YOU ARE TO RECEIVE OR APPROPRIATE HEALTH RATHER THAN TO REJECT AND DENY DISEASE DENYING DISEASE ACCOMPLISHES NEXT TO NOTHING
6111-59779-0002 IT DOES LITTLE GOOD TO CAST OUT THE DEVIL AND LEAVE THE HOUSE VACANT FOR HE WILL PRESENTLY RETURN WITH OTHERS WORSE THAN HIMSELF WHEN YOU ENTER INTO FULL AND CONSTANT MENTAL RELATIONS WITH HEALTH YOU MUST OF NECESSITY CEASE
6111-59779-0003 ALL RELATIONSHIP WITH DISEASE THE FIRST STEP IN THE SCIENCE OF BEING WELL IS THEN TO ENTER INTO COMPLETE THOUGHT CONNECTION WITH HEALTH
6111-59779-0004 OR PICTURE OF YOURSELF AS BEING WELL IMAGINING A PERFECTLY STRONG AND HEALTHY BODY AND TO SPEND SUFFICIENT TIME IN CONTEMPLATING THIS IMAGE TO MAKE IT YOUR HABITUAL THOUGHT OF YOURSELF
6111-59779-0005 THIS IS NOT SO EASY AS IT SOUNDS IT NECESSITATES THE TAKING OF CONSIDERABLE TIME FOR MEDITATION AND NOT ALL PERSONS HAVE THE IMAGING FACULTY WELL ENOUGH DEVELOPED
6111-59779-0006 TO FORM A DISTINCT MENTAL PICTURE OF THEMSELVES IN A PERFECT OR IDEALIZED BODY IT IS MUCH EASIER AS IN THE SCIENCE OF GETTING RICH TO FORM A MENTAL IMAGE OF THE THINGS ONE WANTS TO HAVE
6111-59779-0007 IT IS NOT NECESSARY OR ESSENTIAL HOWEVER TO HAVE A CLEAR MENTAL IMAGE OF YOURSELF AS YOU WISH TO BE IT IS ONLY ESSENTIAL TO FORM A CONCEPTION OF PERFECT HEALTH AND TO RELATE YOURSELF TO IT
6111-59779-0008 THIS CONCEPTION OF HEALTH IS NOT A MENTAL PICTURE OF A PARTICULAR THING IT IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF HEALTH AND CARRIES WITH IT THE IDEA OF PERFECT FUNCTIONING IN EVERY PART AND ORGAN YOU MAY TRY TO PICTURE YOURSELF
6111-59779-0009 YOU CAN PICTURE YOURSELF AS DOING YOUR DAY'S WORK EASILY AND WITH SURPLUS VIGOR NEVER TIRED OR WEAK YOU CAN PICTURE IN YOUR MIND HOW ALL THINGS WOULD BE DONE BY A PERSON FULL OF HEALTH AND POWER
6111-59779-0010 AND YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE PICTURE DOING THINGS IN JUST THAT WAY NEVER THINK OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WEAK OR SICKLY PEOPLE DO THINGS ALWAYS THINK OF THE WAY STRONG PEOPLE DO THINGS SPEND YOUR LEISURE TIME IN THINKING ABOUT THE STRONG WAY
6111-59779-0011 MAN DOES NOT HAVE TO STUDY ANATOMY OR PHYSIOLOGY SO THAT HE CAN FORM A MENTAL IMAGE OF EACH SEPARATE ORGAN AND ADDRESS HIMSELF TO IT HE DOES NOT HAVE TO TREAT HIS LIVER HIS KIDNEYS HIS STOMACH OR HIS HEART THERE IS ONE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH IN MAN
6111-59779-0012 WHICH HAS CONTROL OVER ALL THE INVOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF HIS LIFE AND THE THOUGHT OF PERFECT HEALTH IMPRESSED UPON THIS PRINCIPLE WILL REACH EACH PART AND ORGAN MAN'S LIVER IS NOT CONTROLLED BY A LIVER PRINCIPLE
6111-59779-0013 HIS STOMACH BY A DIGESTIVE PRINCIPLE AND SO ON THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH IS ONE THE LESS YOU GO INTO THE DETAILED STUDY OF PHYSIOLOGY THE BETTER FOR YOU OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS SCIENCE IS VERY IMPERFECT AND LEADS TO IMPERFECT THOUGHT
6111-59779-0014 UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY PHYSIOLOGY FIXED TEN DAYS AS THE EXTREME LIMIT OF MAN'S ENDURANCE WITHOUT FOOD IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES COULD HE SURVIVE A LONGER FAST
6111-59779-0015 SO THE IMPRESSION BECAME UNIVERSALLY DISSEMINATED THAT ONE WHO WAS DEPRIVED OF FOOD MUST DIE IN FROM FIVE TO TEN DAYS AND NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHEN CUT OFF FROM FOOD BY SHIPWRECK ACCIDENT OR FAMINE DID DIE WITHIN THIS PERIOD
6111-59779-0016 BUT THE PERFORMANCES OF DOCTOR TANNER THE FORTY DAY FASTER AND THE WRITINGS OF DOCTOR DEWEY AND OTHERS ON THE FASTING CURE TOGETHER WITH THE EXPERIMENTS OF NUMBERLESS PEOPLE
6111-59779-0017 WHO HAVE FASTED FROM FORTY TO SIXTY DAYS HAVE SHOWN THAT MAN'S ABILITY TO LIVE WITHOUT FOOD IS VASTLY GREATER THAN HAD BEEN SUPPOSED ANY PERSON PROPERLY EDUCATED CAN FAST FROM TWENTY
6111-59779-0018 TO FORTY DAYS WITH LITTLE LOSS IN WEIGHT AND OFTEN WITH NO APPARENT LOSS OF STRENGTH AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO STARVED TO DEATH IN TEN DAYS OR LESS DID SO BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT DEATH WAS INEVITABLE
6111-59779-0019 AN ERRONEOUS PHYSIOLOGY HAD GIVEN THEM A WRONG THOUGHT ABOUT THEMSELVES WHEN A MAN IS DEPRIVED OF FOOD HE WILL DIE IN FROM TEN TO FIFTY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE WAY HE HAS BEEN TAUGHT OR IN OTHER WORDS
6111-59779-0020 ACCORDING TO THE WAY HE THINKS ABOUT IT SO YOU SEE THAT AN ERRONEOUS PHYSIOLOGY CAN WORK VERY MISCHIEVOUS RESULTS NO SCIENCE OF BEING WELL CAN BE FOUNDED ON CURRENT PHYSIOLOGY IT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY EXACT IN ITS KNOWLEDGE
6111-59779-0021 WITH ALL ITS PRETENSIONS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE IS REALLY KNOWN AS TO THE INTERIOR WORKINGS AND PROCESSES OF THE BODY IT IS NOT KNOWN JUST HOW FOOD IS DIGESTED IT IS NOT KNOWN JUST WHAT PART FOOD PLAYS IF ANY
6111-59779-0022 IN THE GENERATION OF FORCE IT IS NOT KNOWN EXACTLY WHAT THE LIVER SPLEEN AND PANCREAS ARE FOR OR WHAT PART THEIR SECRETIONS PLAY IN THE CHEMISTRY OF ASSIMILATION ON ALL THESE AND MOST OTHER POINTS WE THEORIZE
6111-59779-0023 BUT WE DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHEN MAN BEGINS TO STUDY PHYSIOLOGY HE ENTERS THE DOMAIN OF THEORY AND DISPUTATION HE COMES AMONG CONFLICTING OPINIONS
6111-59779-0024 AND HE IS BOUND TO FORM MISTAKEN IDEAS CONCERNING HIMSELF THESE MISTAKEN IDEAS LEAD TO THE THINKING OF WRONG THOUGHTS AND THIS LEADS TO PERVERTED FUNCTIONING AND DISEASE ALL THAT THE MOST PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF PHYSIOLOGY COULD DO FOR MAN
6111-59779-0025 BREATHE AND SLEEP IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY WAY AND THIS AS WE SHALL SHOW HE CAN DO WITHOUT STUDYING PHYSIOLOGY AT ALL THIS FOR THE MOST PART IS TRUE OF ALL HYGIENE
6111-59779-0026 THERE ARE CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS WHICH WE SHOULD KNOW AND THESE WILL BE EXPLAINED IN LATER CHAPTERS BUT ASIDE FROM THESE PROPOSITIONS IGNORE PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE
6111-59779-0027 ITS CAUSES OR POSSIBLE RESULTS AND SET YOURSELF TO THE WORK OF FORMING A CONCEPTION OF HEALTH THINK ABOUT HEALTH AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF HEALTH OF THE WORK THAT MAY BE DONE
6111-59779-0028 AND THE PLEASURES THAT MAY BE ENJOYED IN A CONDITION OF PERFECT HEALTH THEN MAKE THIS CONCEPTION YOUR GUIDE IN THINKING OF YOURSELF REFUSE TO ENTERTAIN FOR AN INSTANT ANY THOUGHT OF YOURSELF WHICH IS NOT IN HARMONY WITH IT
6111-59779-0029 CAST IT OUT INSTANTLY BY CALLING UP A THOUGHT WHICH IS IN HARMONY WITH THE CONCEPTION OF HEALTH THINK OF YOURSELF AT ALL TIMES AS REALIZING CONCEPTION AS BEING A STRONG AND PERFECTLY HEALTHY PERSONAGE AND DO NOT HARBOR A CONTRARY THOUGHT
6111-59779-0030 KNOW THAT AS YOU THINK OF YOURSELF IN UNITY WITH THIS CONCEPTION THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE WHICH PERMEATES AND FILLS THE TISSUES OF YOUR BODY IS TAKING FORM ACCORDING TO THE THOUGHT AND KNOW THAT THIS INTELLIGENT
6111-59779-0031 SUBSTANCE OR MIND STUFF WILL CAUSE FUNCTION TO BE PERFORMED IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOUR BODY WILL BE REBUILT WITH PERFECTLY HEALTHY CELLS THE INTELLIGENT SUBSTANCE FROM WHICH ALL THINGS ARE MADE
6111-59779-0032 PERMEATES AND PENETRATES ALL THINGS AND SO IT IS IN AND THROUGH YOUR BODY IT MOVES ACCORDING TO ITS THOUGHTS AND SO IF YOU HOLD ONLY THE THOUGHTS OF PERFECTLY HEALTHY FUNCTION
6111-59779-0033 IT WILL CAUSE THE MOVEMENTS OF PERFECTLY HEALTHY FUNCTION WITHIN YOU HOLD WITH PERSISTENCE TO THE THOUGHT OF PERFECT HEALTH IN RELATION TO YOURSELF DO NOT PERMIT YOURSELF TO THINK IN ANY OTHER WAY
6111-59779-0034 HOLD THIS THOUGHT WITH PERFECT FAITH THAT IT IS THE FACT THE TRUTH IT IS THE TRUTH SO FAR AS YOUR MENTAL BODY IS CONCERNED YOU HAVE A MIND BODY AND A PHYSICAL BODY
6111-59779-0035 THE MIND BODY TAKES FORM JUST AS YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AND ANY THOUGHT WHICH YOU HOLD CONTINUOUSLY IS MADE VISIBLE BY THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PHYSICAL BODY INTO ITS IMAGE IMPLANTING THE THOUGHT OF PERFECT FUNCTIONING IN THE MIND BODY WILL
6111-59779-0036 IN DUE TIME CAUSE PERFECT FUNCTIONING IN THE PHYSICAL BODY THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PHYSICAL BODY INTO THE IMAGE OF THE IDEAL HELD BY THE MIND BODY IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED INSTANTANEOUSLY
6111-59779-0037 SUBSTANCE MOVES ALONG THE FIXED LINES OF GROWTH IT HAS ESTABLISHED AND THE IMPRESSION UPON IT OF THE HEALTH THOUGHT CAUSES THE HEALTHY BODY TO BE BUILT CELL BY CELL HOLDING ONLY THOUGHTS OF PERFECT HEALTH WILL ULTIMATELY CAUSE PERFECT FUNCTIONING
6111-59779-0038 AND PERFECT FUNCTIONING WILL IN DUE TIME PRODUCE A PERFECTLY HEALTHY BODY IT MAY BE AS WELL TO CONDENSE THIS CHAPTER INTO A SYLLABUS YOUR PHYSICAL BODY IS PERMEATED AND FITTED WITH AN INTELLIGENT SUBSTANCE
6111-59779-0039 WHICH FORMS A BODY OF MIND STUFF THIS MIND STUFF CONTROLS THE FUNCTIONING OF YOUR PHYSICAL BODY A THOUGHT OF DISEASE OR OF IMPERFECT FUNCTION IMPRESSED UPON THE MIND STUFF CAUSES DISEASE OR IMPERFECT FUNCTIONING IN THE PHYSICAL BODY
6111-59779-0040 HAVE MADE IMPRESSIONS ON THIS MIND STUFF THESE MAY HAVE BEEN EITHER YOUR OWN THOUGHTS OR THOSE OF YOUR PARENTS WE BEGIN LIFE WITH MANY SUB CONSCIOUS IMPRESSIONS BOTH RIGHT AND WRONG BUT THE NATURAL TENDENCY
6111-59779-0041 OF ALL MIND IS TOWARD HEALTH AND IF NO THOUGHTS ARE HELD IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND SAVE THOSE OF HEALTH ALL INTERNAL FUNCTIONING WILL COME TO BE PERFORMED IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY MANNER THE POWER OF NATURE WITHIN YOU IS SUFFICIENT
6111-59779-0042 TO OVERCOME ALL HEREDITARY IMPRESSIONS AND IF YOU WILL LEARN TO CONTROL YOUR THOUGHTS SO THAT YOU SHALL THINK ONLY THOSE OF HEALTH
