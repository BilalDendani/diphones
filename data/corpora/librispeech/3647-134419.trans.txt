3647-134419-0000 IT WAS A DARK WET GLOOMY NIGHT IN AUTUMN WHEN IN AN UPPER ROOM OF A MEAN HOUSE SITUATED IN AN OBSCURE STREET OR RATHER COURT NEAR LAMBETH THERE SAT ALL ALONE A ONE EYED MAN GROTESQUELY HABITED
3647-134419-0001 EITHER FOR LACK OF BETTER GARMENTS OR FOR PURPOSES OF DISGUISE IN A LOOSE GREATCOAT WITH ARMS HALF AS LONG AGAIN AS HIS OWN AND A CAPACITY OF BREADTH AND LENGTH WHICH WOULD HAVE ADMITTED OF HIS WINDING HIMSELF IN IT HEAD AND ALL
3647-134419-0002 AND SO VERY POOR AND WRETCHED IN ITS CHARACTER PERHAPS MISSUS SQUEERS HERSELF WOULD HAVE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNISING HER LORD QUICKENED THOUGH HER NATURAL SAGACITY DOUBTLESS WOULD HAVE BEEN BY THE AFFECTIONATE YEARNINGS AND IMPULSES OF A TENDER WIFE
3647-134419-0003 BUT MISSUS SQUEERS'S LORD IT WAS AND IN A TOLERABLY DISCONSOLATE MOOD MISSUS SQUEERS'S LORD APPEARED TO BE AS HELPING HIMSELF FROM A BLACK BOTTLE WHICH STOOD ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM HE CAST ROUND THE CHAMBER A LOOK
3647-134419-0004 WHICH THE GLANCE OF MISTER SQUEERS SO DISCONTENTEDLY WANDERED OR IN THE NARROW STREET INTO WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE PENETRATED IF HE HAD THOUGHT FIT TO APPROACH THE WINDOW
3647-134419-0005 THE BEDSTEAD AND SUCH FEW OTHER ARTICLES OF NECESSARY FURNITURE AS IT CONTAINED WERE OF THE COMMONEST DESCRIPTION IN A MOST CRAZY STATE AND OF A MOST UNINVITING APPEARANCE THE STREET WAS MUDDY DIRTY AND DESERTED
3647-134419-0006 HAVING BUT ONE OUTLET IT WAS TRAVERSED BY FEW BUT THE INHABITANTS AT ANY TIME AND THE NIGHT BEING ONE OF THOSE ON WHICH MOST PEOPLE ARE GLAD TO BE WITHIN DOORS
3647-134419-0007 MISTER SQUEERS CONTINUED TO LOOK DISCONSOLATELY ABOUT HIM AND TO LISTEN TO THESE NOISES IN PROFOUND SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE RUSTLING OF HIS LARGE COAT AS HE NOW AND THEN MOVED HIS ARM TO RAISE HIS GLASS TO HIS LIPS
3647-134419-0008 MISTER SQUEERS CONTINUED TO DO THIS FOR SOME TIME UNTIL THE INCREASING GLOOM WARNED HIM TO SNUFF THE CANDLE SEEMING TO BE SLIGHTLY ROUSED BY THIS EXERTION
3647-134419-0009 TRACED UPON IT BY THE WET AND DAMP WHICH HAD PENETRATED THROUGH THE ROOF BROKE INTO THE FOLLOWING SOLILOQUY
3647-134419-0010 AN UNCOMMON PRETTY GO
3647-134419-0011 A FOLLERING UP THIS HERE BLESSED OLD DOWAGER PETTY LARCENERER MISTER SQUEERS DELIVERED HIMSELF OF THIS EPITHET WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND EFFORT
3647-134419-0012 THAT'S THE WORST OF EVER BEING IN WITH A OWDACIOUS CHAP LIKE THAT OLD NICKLEBY
3647-134419-0013 I NEVER SEE SOLILOQUISED MISTER SQUEERS IN CONTINUATION I NEVER SEE NOR COME ACROSS SUCH A FILE AS THAT OLD NICKLEBY NEVER HE'S OUT OF EVERYBODY'S DEPTH HE IS HE'S WHAT YOU MAY CALL A RASPER IS NICKLEBY
3647-134419-0014 TO SEE HOW SLY AND CUNNING HE GRUBBED ON DAY AFTER DAY
3647-134419-0015 TILL HE FOUND OUT WHERE THIS PRECIOUS MISSUS PEG WAS HID AND CLEARED THE GROUND FOR ME TO WORK UPON
3647-134419-0016 AH HE'D HAVE MADE A GOOD UN IN OUR LINE BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LIMITED FOR HIM HIS GENIUS WOULD HAVE BUSTED ALL BONDS AND COMING OVER EVERY OBSTACLE BROKE DOWN ALL BEFORE IT TILL IT ERECTED ITSELF INTO A MONNEYMENT OF WELL
3647-134419-0017 MAKING A HALT IN HIS REFLECTIONS AT THIS PLACE
3647-134419-0018 PROCEEDED TO CON OVER ITS CONTENTS WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAD READ IT VERY OFTEN AND NOW REFRESHED HIS MEMORY RATHER IN THE ABSENCE OF BETTER AMUSEMENT THAN FOR ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION THE PIGS IS WELL
3647-134419-0019 SAID MISTER SQUEERS THE COWS IS WELL AND THE BOYS IS BOBBISH YOUNG SPROUTER HAS BEEN A WINKING HAS HE I'LL WINK HIM WHEN I GET BACK COBBEY WOULD PERSIST IN SNIFFING WHILE HE WAS A EATING HIS DINNER AND SAID THAT THE BEEF WAS SO STRONG IT MADE HIM
3647-134419-0020 VERY GOOD COBBEY WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN'T MAKE YOU SNIFF A LITTLE WITHOUT BEEF
3647-134419-0021 IT'S PART OF A DEEP LAID SYSTEM
3647-134419-0022 AS WOULD HAVE DIED EXACTLY AT THE END OF THE QUARTER TAKING IT OUT OF ME TO THE VERY LAST AND THEN CARRYING HIS SPITE TO THE UTMOST EXTREMITY THE JUNIOREST PALMER SAID HE WISHED HE WAS IN HEAVEN
3647-134419-0023 I REALLY DON'T KNOW I DO NOT KNOW WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THAT YOUNG FELLOW HE'S ALWAYS A WISHING SOMETHING HORRID
3647-134419-0024 PRETTY WICIOUS THAT FOR A CHILD OF SIX MISTER SQUEERS WAS SO MUCH MOVED BY THE CONTEMPLATION OF THIS HARDENED NATURE IN ONE SO YOUNG THAT HE ANGRILY PUT UP THE LETTER AND SOUGHT IN A NEW TRAIN OF IDEAS A SUBJECT OF CONSOLATION
3647-134419-0025 IT'S A LONG TIME TO HAVE BEEN A LINGERING IN LONDON HE SAID
3647-134419-0026 AND THERE'S THEIR KEEP TO BE SUBSTRACTED BESIDES THERE'S NOTHING LOST NEITHER BY ONE'S BEING HERE BECAUSE THE BOYS MONEY COMES IN JUST THE SAME AS IF I WAS AT HOME AND MISSUS SQUEERS SHE KEEPS THEM IN ORDER
3647-134419-0027 IT'S PRETTY NIGH THE TIME TO WAIT UPON THE OLD WOMAN FROM WHAT SHE SAID LAST NIGHT I SUSPECT THAT IF I'M TO SUCCEED AT ALL I SHALL SUCCEED TONIGHT SO
3647-134419-0028 AND PUT MYSELF IN SPIRITS MISSUS SQUEERS MY DEAR YOUR HEALTH LEERING WITH HIS ONE EYE AS IF THE LADY TO WHOM HE DRANK HAD BEEN ACTUALLY PRESENT
3647-134419-0029 IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF BY THIS TIME IN AN EXTREMELY CHEERFUL STATE AND QUITE ENOUGH EXCITED FOR HIS PURPOSE WHAT THIS PURPOSE WAS SOON APPEARED FOR AFTER A FEW TURNS ABOUT THE ROOM TO STEADY HIMSELF
3647-134419-0030 BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF TAPPING HE SAID SHE'LL NEVER HEAR I SUPPOSE SHE ISN'T DOING ANYTHING VERY PARTICULAR AND IF SHE IS IT DON'T MUCH MATTER THAT I SEE WITH THIS BRIEF PREFACE MISTER SQUEERS APPLIED HIS HAND TO THE LATCH
3647-134419-0031 OF THE DOOR AND THRUSTING HIS HEAD INTO A GARRET FAR MORE DEPLORABLE THAN THAT HE HAD JUST LEFT AND SEEING THAT THERE WAS NOBODY THERE BUT AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS BENDING OVER A WRETCHED FIRE FOR ALTHOUGH THE WEATHER WAS STILL WARM THE EVENING WAS CHILLY WALKED IN AND TAPPED HER ON THE SHOULDER
3647-134419-0032 WELL MY SLIDER SAID MISTER SQUEERS JOCULARLY

3647-134419-0064 COMPLIED WITH THIS REQUEST BY DESCRIBING THE DISCOMFITURE OF ARTHUR GRIDE WITH SUCH IMPROVEMENTS ON THE TRUTH AS HAPPENED TO OCCUR TO HIM AND THE INGENIOUS INVENTION AND APPLICATION OF WHICH HAD BEEN VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN RECOMMENDING HIM TO HER NOTICE IN THE BEGINNING OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3647-134419-0065 AND WRINKLING HER CADAVEROUS FACE INTO SO MANY AND SUCH COMPLICATED FORMS OF UGLINESS

3647-134419-0074 REPRESSING WITH AS GOOD A GRACE AS POSSIBLE THESE LITTLE FAMILIARITIES FOR WHICH THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THE BLACK BOTTLE WAS AT LEAST AS MUCH TO BLAME AS ANY CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITY ON THE PART OF MISSUS SLIDERSKEW HE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD ONLY BEEN JOKING
3647-134419-0075 AND IN PROOF OF HIS UNIMPAIRED GOOD HUMOUR
