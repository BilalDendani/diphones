8410-278217-0000 A DRESSING CASE AND A DESPATCH BOX THE SAME DESPATCH BOX WHOSE CONTENTS HE HAD SO CAREFULLY STUDIED AT THE WINCHESTER HOTEL UPON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER IN THE GROVE THE DAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL WAS SUNDAY
8410-278217-0001 AND ALL THAT DAY THE BANKER OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN READING A MOROCCO BOUND MANUSCRIPT VOLUME WHICH HE TOOK FROM THE DESPATCH BOX THERE WAS A BLACK FOG UPON THIS NOVEMBER DAY AND THE ATMOSPHERE OUT OF DOORS WAS COLD AND BLEAK BUT THE ROOM IN WHICH HENRY DUNBAR SAT LOOKED THE VERY PICTURE OF COMFORT AND ELEGANCE
8410-278217-0002 HENRY DUNBAR SAT BY THE FIRE SMOKING AND DRINKING AND READING THE MANUSCRIPT VOLUME HE ONLY PAUSED NOW AND THEN TO TAKE PENCIL NOTES OF ITS CONTENTS IN A LITTLE MEMORANDUM BOOK WHICH HE CARRIED IN THE BREAST POCKET OF HIS COAT IT WAS NOT TILL SEVEN O'CLOCK
8410-278217-0003 WHEN THE LIVERIED SERVANT WHO WAITED UPON HIM CAME TO INFORM HIM THAT HIS DINNER WAS SERVED IN AN ADJOINING CHAMBER THAT MISTER DUNBAR ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND PUT AWAY THE BOOK IN THE DESPATCH BOX HE LAID DOWN THE VOLUME ON THE TABLE WHILE HE REPLACED OTHER PAPERS IN THE BOX AND IT FELL OPEN AT THE FIRST PAGE
8410-278217-0004 ON THAT FIRST PAGE WAS WRITTEN IN HENRY DUNBAR'S BOLD LEGIBLE HAND JOURNAL OF MY LIFE IN INDIA
8410-278217-0005 THIS WAS THE BOOK THE BANKER HAD BEEN STUDYING ALL THAT WINTER'S DAY AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY HE ORDERED A BROUGHAM AND WAS DRIVEN TO THE BANKING HOUSE IN SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT HENRY DUNBAR HAD VISITED THE HOUSE IN SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE SINCE HIS RETURN FROM INDIA
8410-278217-0006 THEY KNEW THAT AS A YOUNG MAN HENRY DUNBAR HAD CONTRACTED THE TASTES AND HABITS OF AN ARISTOCRAT AND THAT IF HE HAD AFTERWARDS DEVELOPED INTO A CLEVER AND SUCCESSFUL MAN OF BUSINESS
8410-278217-0007 THAT AFTER BECOMING POSSESSOR OF THE UNITED FORTUNES OF HIS FATHER AND HIS UNCLE HENRY DUNBAR SHOULD KEEP ALOOF FROM A PLACE THAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN OBNOXIOUS TO HIM THE BUSINESS HAD GONE ON WITHOUT HIM VERY WELL DURING HIS ABSENCE AND IT WENT ON WITHOUT HIM NOW
8410-278217-0008 FOR HIS PLACE IN INDIA HAD BEEN ASSUMED BY A VERY CLEVER MAN WHO FOR TWENTY YEARS HAD ACTED AS CASHIER IN THE CALCUTTA HOUSE IT MAY BE THAT THE BANKER HAD AN UNPLEASANT RECOLLECTION OF HIS LAST VISIT TO SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE
8410-278217-0009 UPON THE DAY WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF THE FORGED BILLS WAS DISCOVERED BY PERCIVAL AND HUGH DUNBAR ALL THE WIDTH OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS BETWEEN THE PRESENT HOUR AND THAT DAY MIGHT NOT BE WIDE ENOUGH TO SEPARATE THE MEMORY OF THE PAST FROM THE THOUGHTS WHICH WERE BUSY THIS MORNING IN THE MIND OF HENRY DUNBAR BE IT AS IT MIGHT
8410-278217-0010 AND HIS FACE HAD A STERN FIXED LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO HAS NERVED HIMSELF TO MEET SOME CRISIS WHICH HE KNOWS IS NEAR AT HAND THERE WAS A STOPPAGE UPON LUDGATE HILL GREAT WOODEN BARRICADES AND MOUNTAINS OF UPROOTED PAVING STONES
8410-278217-0011 AMIDST WHICH STURDY NAVIGATORS DISPORTED THEMSELVES WITH SPADES AND PICKAXES
8410-278217-0012 AND UNDER THE GRIM BLACK WALLS OF DREADFUL NEWGATE THE VEHICLE TRAVELLED VERY SLOWLY FOR THE TRAFFIC WAS CONCENTRATED IN THIS QUARTER BY REASON OF THE STOPPAGE ON LUDGATE HILL
8410-278217-0013 THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH TWITCHED NERVOUSLY AS HE GOT OUT OF THE CARRIAGE BEFORE THE MAHOGANY DOORS OF THE BANKING HOUSE IN SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE
8410-278217-0014 BUT HE DREW A LONG BREATH AND HELD HIS HEAD PROUDLY ERECT AS HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOORS AND WENT IN NEVER SINCE THE DAY OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE FORGED BILLS HAD THAT MAN ENTERED THE BANKING HOUSE
8410-278217-0015 BUT BEFORE HE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR LEADING FROM THE PUBLIC OFFICES TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE HE WAS STOPPED BY A GENTLEMANLY LOOKING MAN WHO CAME FORWARD FROM A DESK IN SOME SHADOWY REGION AND INTERCEPTED THE STRANGER THIS MAN WAS CLEMENT AUSTIN THE CASHIER
8410-278217-0016 DO YOU WISH TO SEE MISTER BALDERBY SIR HE ASKED YES I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM AT ONE O'CLOCK MY NAME IS DUNBAR THE CASHIER BOWED AND OPENED THE DOOR
8410-278217-0017 THE BANKER PASSED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD WHICH HE HAD NOT CROSSED FOR FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS UNTIL TO DAY BUT AS MISTER DUNBAR WENT TOWARDS THE FAMILIAR PARLOUR AT THE BACK OF THE BANKING HOUSE HE STOPPED FOR A MINUTE AND LOOKED AT THE CASHIER
8410-278217-0018 CLEMENT AUSTIN WAS SCARCELY LESS PALE THAN HENRY DUNBAR HIMSELF HE HAD HEARD OF THE BANKER'S INTENDED VISIT TO SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE AND HAD LOOKED FORWARD WITH STRANGE ANXIETY TO A MEETING WITH THE MAN WHOM MARGARET WILMOT DECLARED TO BE THE MURDERER OF HER FATHER NOW THAT THE MEETING HAD COME TO PASS
8410-278217-0019 HE LOOKED AT HENRY DUNBAR WITH AN EARNEST SCRUTINIZING GAZE AS IF HE WOULD FAIN HAVE DISCOVERED THE SECRET OF THE MAN'S GUILT OR INNOCENCE IN HIS COUNTENANCE THE BANKER'S FACE WAS PALE AND GRAVE AND STERN
8410-278217-0020 BUT CLEMENT AUSTIN KNEW THAT FOR HENRY DUNBAR THERE WERE VERY HUMILIATING AND UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICES IN SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE AND IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED THAT A MAN WOULD COME SMILING INTO A PLACE OUT OF WHICH HE HAD GONE FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS BEFORE
8410-278217-0021 A DISGRACED AND DEGRADED CREATURE FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE TWO MEN PAUSED IN THE PASSAGE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC OFFICES AND THE PRIVATE PARLOUR LOOKING AT EACH OTHER THE BANKER'S GAZE NEVER FLINCHED DURING THAT ENCOUNTER
8410-278217-0022 IT IS TAKEN AS A STRONG PROOF OF A MAN'S INNOCENCE THAT HE SHOULD LOOK YOU FULL IN THE FACE WITH A STEADFAST GAZE WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIM WITH SUSPICION PLAINLY VISIBLE IN YOUR EYES BUT WOULD HE NOT BE THE POOREST VILLAIN IF HE SHIRKED THAT ENCOUNTER OF GLANCES WHEN HE KNOWS FULL SURELY THAT HE IS IN THAT MOMENT PUT TO THE TEST
8410-278217-0023 IT IS RATHER INNOCENCE WHOSE EYELIDS DROP WHEN YOU PEER TOO CLOSELY INTO ITS EYES FOR INNOCENCE IS APPALLED BY THE STERN ACCUSING GLANCES WHICH IT IS UNPREPARED TO MEET
8410-278217-0024 GUILT STARES YOU BOLDLY IN THE FACE FOR GUILT IS HARDENED AND DEFIANT AND HAS THIS ONE GRAND SUPERIORITY OVER INNOCENCE THAT IT IS PREPARED FOR THE WORST CLEMENT AUSTIN OPENED THE DOOR OF MISTER BALDERBY'S PARLOUR MISTER DUNBAR WENT IN UNANNOUNCED
8410-278217-0025 THE CASHIER CLOSED THE PARLOUR DOOR AND RETURNED TO HIS DESK IN THE PUBLIC OFFICE THE JUNIOR PARTNER WAS SITTING AT AN OFFICE TABLE NEAR THE FIRE WRITING BUT HE ROSE AS THE BANKER ENTERED THE ROOM AND WENT FORWARD TO MEET HIM YOU ARE VERY PUNCTUAL MISTER DUNBAR HE SAID
8410-278217-0026 YES I AM GENERALLY PUNCTUAL THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS AND MISTER BALDERBY WHEELED FORWARD A MOROCCO COVERED ARM CHAIR FOR HIS SENIOR PARTNER AND THEN TOOK HIS SEAT OPPOSITE TO HIM WITH ONLY THE SMALL OFFICE TABLE BETWEEN THEM
8410-278217-0027 IT MAY SEEM LATE IN THE DAY TO BID YOU WELCOME TO THE BANK MISTER DUNBAR SAID THE JUNIOR PARTNER BUT I DO SO NEVERTHELESS MOST HEARTILY
8410-278217-0028 WHICH WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF A FALSE COIN WHEN IT FALLS DEAD UPON A COUNTER AND PROCLAIMS ITSELF SPURIOUS HENRY DUNBAR DID NOT RETURN HIS PARTNER'S GREETING HE WAS LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM AND REMEMBERING THE DAY UPON WHICH HE HAD LAST SEEN IT
8410-278217-0029 EVEN THE TURKEY CARPET WAS IN THE VERY STAGE OF DUSKY DINGINESS THAT HAD DISTINGUISHED THE CARPET ON WHICH HENRY DUNBAR HAD STOOD FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS BEFORE
8410-278217-0030 MISTER BALDERBY SAID AFTER A PAUSE I HAVE MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO ASSURE OUR BEING UNDISTURBED SO LONG AS YOU MAY REMAIN HERE IF YOU WISH TO MAKE ANY INVESTIGATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE HOUSE I MISTER DUNBAR WAVED HIS HAND WITH A DEPRECATORY AIR
8410-278217-0031 NOTHING IS FARTHER FROM MY THOUGHTS THAN ANY SUCH DESIGN HE SAID NO MISTER BALDERBY I HAVE ONLY BEEN A MAN OF BUSINESS BECAUSE ALL CHANCE OF ANOTHER CAREER WHICH I INFINITELY PREFERRED WAS CLOSED UPON ME FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS AGO
8410-278217-0032 I AM QUITE CONTENT TO BE A SLEEPING PARTNER IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY FOR TEN YEARS PRIOR TO MY FATHER'S DEATH HE TOOK NO ACTIVE PART IN THE BUSINESS THE HOUSE GOT ON VERY WELL WITHOUT HIS AID IT WILL GET ON EQUALLY WELL WITHOUT MINE
8410-278217-0033 I AM A RICH MAN BUT I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW RICH I AM AND I WANT TO REALIZE RATHER A LARGE SUM OF MONEY MISTER BALDERBY BOWED BUT HIS EYEBROWS WENT UP A LITTLE AS IF HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL SOME SLIGHT EVIDENCE OF HIS SURPRISE
8410-278217-0034 PREVIOUS TO MY DAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE I SETTLED UPON HER THE HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE AND THE YORKSHIRE PROPERTY
8410-278217-0035 AND AS SIR PHILIP JOCELYN IS A RICH MAN SHE WILL PERHAPS BE ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST WOMEN IN ENGLAND SO FAR SO GOOD NEITHER LAURA NOR HER HUSBAND WILL HAVE ANY REASON FOR DISSATISFACTION BUT THIS IS NOT QUITE ENOUGH MISTER BALDERBY I AM NOT A DEMONSTRATIVE MAN
8410-278217-0036 AND I HAVE NEVER MADE ANY GREAT FUSS ABOUT MY LOVE FOR MY DAUGHTER BUT I DO LOVE HER NEVERTHELESS MISTER DUNBAR SPOKE VERY SLOWLY HERE AND STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE TO PASS HIS HANDKERCHIEF ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD AS HE HAD DONE IN THE HOTEL AT WINCHESTER
8410-278217-0037 HE CONTINUED WHEN WE TAKE IT INTO OUR HEADS TO DO THEM AT ALL I WANT TO GIVE MY DAUGHTER A DIAMOND NECKLACE AS A WEDDING PRESENT AND I WANT IT TO BE SUCH AS AN EASTERN PRINCE OR A ROTHSCHILD MIGHT OFFER TO HIS ONLY CHILD YOU UNDERSTAND OH PERFECTLY
8410-278217-0038 ANSWERED MISTER BALDERBY I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO BE OF ANY USE TO YOU IN THE MATTER ALL I WANT IS A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AT MY COMMAND I MAY GO RATHER RECKLESSLY TO WORK AND MAKE A LARGE INVESTMENT IN THIS NECKLACE IT WILL BE SOMETHING FOR LADY JOCELYN TO BEQUEATH TO HER CHILDREN
8410-278217-0039 I DID IN CONCURRENCE WITH MISTER LOVELL PRECISELY LOVELL WROTE ME A LETTER TO THAT EFFECT MY FATHER KEPT TWO ACCOUNTS HERE I BELIEVE A DEPOSIT AND A DRAWING ACCOUNT HE DID
8410-278217-0040 AND THOSE TWO ACCOUNTS HAVE GONE ON SINCE MY RETURN IN THE SAME MANNER AS DURING HIS LIFETIME PRECISELY
8410-278217-0041 HE RARELY SPENT AS MUCH AS THAT SOMETIMES HE SPENT LESS THAN HALF THE BALANCE OF THIS INCOME AND HIS DOUBLE SHARE IN THE PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS WENT TO THE CREDIT OF HIS DEPOSIT ACCOUNT AND VARIOUS SUMS HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM TIME TO TIME AND DULY INVESTED UNDER HIS ORDER
8410-278217-0042 CLEMENT AUSTIN APPEARED FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS CARRYING TWO PONDEROUS MOROCCO BOUND VOLUMES MISTER BALDERBY OPENED BOTH LEDGERS AND PLACED THEM BEFORE HIS SENIOR PARTNER HENRY DUNBAR LOOKED AT THE DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
8410-278217-0043 THEN HIS CHEST HEAVED AND HE DREW A LONG BREATH
8410-278217-0044 HIS FINGERS TREMBLED A LITTLE AS HE DID SO AND HE DROPPED HIS HAND SUDDENLY UPON THE LEDGER THERE'S FIFTY THOUSAND IN INDIA STOCK MISTER BALDERBY ANSWERED AS INDIFFERENTLY AS IF FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS MORE OR LESS WAS SCARCELY WORTH SPEAKING OF
8410-278217-0045 AND THERE'S FIVE AND TWENTY IN RAILWAY DEBENTURES GREAT WESTERN MOST OF THE REMAINDER IS FLOATING IN EXCHEQUER BILLS THEN YOU CAN REALIZE THE EXCHEQUER BILLS MISTER BALDERBY WINCED AS IF SOME ONE HAD TRODDEN UPON ONE OF HIS CORNS
8410-278217-0046 IT'S RATHER A LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO WITHDRAW FROM THE BUSINESS HE SAID RUBBING HIS CHIN THOUGHTFULLY I SUPPOSE THE BANK CAN AFFORD IT MISTER DUNBAR EXCLAIMED WITH A TONE OF SURPRISE OH YES THE BANK CAN AFFORD IT WELL ENOUGH
8410-278217-0047 OUR CALLS ARE SOMETIMES HEAVY LORD YARSFIELD A VERY OLD CUSTOMER TALKS OF BUYING AN ESTATE IN WALES HE MAY COME DOWN UPON US AT ANY MOMENT FOR A VERY STIFF SUM OF MONEY HOWEVER THE CAPITAL IS YOURS MISTER DUNBAR AND YOU'VE A RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF IT AS YOU PLEASE
8410-278217-0048 THE EXCHEQUER BILLS SHALL BE REALIZED IMMEDIATELY GOOD AND IF YOU CAN DISPOSE OF THE RAILWAY BONDS TO ADVANTAGE YOU MAY DO SO YOU THINK OF SPENDING I THINK OF REINVESTING THE MONEY
8410-278217-0049 I HAVE AN OFFER OF AN ESTATE NORTH OF THE METROPOLIS WHICH I THINK WILL REALIZE CENT PER CENT A FEW YEARS HENCE BUT THAT IS AN AFTER CONSIDERATION
8410-278217-0050 I SHALL BUY THE DIAMONDS MYSELF DIRECT FROM THE MERCHANT IMPORTERS YOU WILL HOLD YOURSELF READY AFTER WEDNESDAY WE'LL SAY TO CASH SOME VERY HEAVY CHEQUES ON MY ACCOUNT CERTAINLY MISTER DUNBAR THEN I THINK THAT IS REALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY
8410-278217-0051 I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU AT THE CLARENDON IF YOU WILL DINE WITH ME ANY EVENING THAT YOU ARE DISENGAGED THERE WAS VERY LITTLE HEARTINESS IN THE TONE OF THIS INVITATION AND MISTER BALDERBY PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS ONLY A FORMULA WHICH MISTER DUNBAR FELT HIMSELF CALLED UPON TO GO THROUGH
8410-278217-0052 THE JUNIOR PARTNER MURMURED HIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HENRY DUNBAR'S POLITENESS AND THEN THE TWO MEN TALKED TOGETHER FOR A FEW MINUTES ON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS MISTER DUNBAR ROSE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
8410-278217-0053 BETWEEN THE END OF THE PASSAGE AND THE OUTER DOORS OF THE BANK HENRY DUNBAR SAW THE FIGURE OF A WOMAN SITTING NEAR ONE OF THE DESKS AND TALKING TO CLEMENT AUSTIN THE BANKER STOPPED SUDDENLY AND WENT BACK TO THE PARLOUR HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM A LITTLE ABSENTLY AS HE RE ENTERED THE ROOM
8410-278217-0054 I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING ONE IN YOUR HAND AH THEN I SUPPOSE I WAS MISTAKEN HE STILL LINGERED IN THE PARLOUR PUTTING ON HIS GLOVES VERY SLOWLY AND LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO THE DISMAL BACKYARD WHERE THERE WAS A DINGY LITTLE WOODEN DOOR SET DEEP IN THE STONE WALL
8410-278217-0055 WHILE THE BANKER LOITERED NEAR THE WINDOW CLEMENT AUSTIN CAME INTO THE ROOM TO SHOW SOME DOCUMENT TO THE JUNIOR PARTNER HENRY DUNBAR TURNED ROUND AS THE CASHIER WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE PARLOUR I SAW A WOMAN JUST NOW TALKING TO YOU IN THE OFFICE
8410-278217-0056 THAT'S NOT VERY BUSINESS LIKE IS IT MISTER AUSTIN WHO IS THE WOMAN SHE IS A YOUNG LADY SIR A YOUNG LADY YES SIR WHAT BRINGS HER HERE THE CASHIER HESITATED FOR A MOMENT BEFORE HE REPLIED
8410-278217-0057 SHE WISHES TO SEE YOU MISTER DUNBAR HE SAID AFTER THAT BRIEF PAUSE WHAT IS HER NAME WHO WHO IS SHE HER NAME IS WILMOT MARGARET WILMOT
8410-278217-0058 I KNOW NO SUCH PERSON ANSWERED THE BANKER HAUGHTILY BUT LOOKING NERVOUSLY AT THE HALF OPENED DOOR AS HE SPOKE SHUT THAT DOOR SIR HE SAID IMPATIENTLY TO THE CASHIER THE DRAUGHT FROM THE PASSAGE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO CUT A MAN IN TWO WHO IS THIS MARGARET WILMOT
8410-278217-0059 THE DAUGHTER OF THAT UNFORTUNATE MAN JOSEPH WILMOT WHO WAS CRUELLY MURDERED AT WINCHESTER ANSWERED THE CASHIER VERY GRAVELY HE LOOKED HENRY DUNBAR FULL IN THE FACE AS HE SPOKE
8410-278217-0060 THE BANKER RETURNED HIS LOOK AS UNFLINCHINGLY AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE AND SPOKE IN A HARD UNFALTERING VOICE AS HE ANSWERED TELL THIS PERSON MARGARET WILMOT
8410-278217-0061 THAT I REFUSE TO SEE HER TO DAY AS I REFUSED TO SEE HER IN PORTLAND PLACE AND AS I REFUSED TO SEE HER AT WINCHESTER HE SAID DELIBERATELY TELL HER THAT I SHALL ALWAYS REFUSE TO SEE HER
8410-278217-0062 I HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY ON ACCOUNT OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSINESS AT WINCHESTER AND I SHALL MOST RESOLUTELY DEFEND MYSELF FROM ANY FURTHER PERSECUTION THIS YOUNG PERSON CAN HAVE NO POSSIBLE MOTIVE FOR WISHING TO SEE ME IF SHE IS POOR AND WANTS MONEY OF ME I AM READY AND WILLING TO ASSIST HER
8410-278217-0063 I HAVE ALREADY OFFERED TO DO SO I CAN DO NO MORE BUT IF SHE IS IN DISTRESS SHE IS NOT IN DISTRESS MISTER DUNBAR INTERRUPTED CLEMENT AUSTIN SHE HAS FRIENDS WHO LOVE HER WELL ENOUGH TO SHIELD HER FROM THAT INDEED
8410-278217-0064 AND YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE FRIENDS I SUPPOSE MISTER AUSTIN I AM PROVE YOUR FRIENDSHIP THEN BY TEACHING MARGARET WILMOT THAT SHE HAS A FRIEND AND NOT AN ENEMY IN ME IF YOU ARE AS I SUSPECT FROM YOUR MANNER SOMETHING MORE THAN A FRIEND
8410-278217-0065 IF YOU LOVE HER AND SHE RETURNS YOUR LOVE MARRY HER AND SHE SHALL HAVE A DOWRY THAT NO GENTLEMAN'S WIFE NEED BE ASHAMED TO BRING TO HER HUSBAND THERE WAS NO ANGER NO IMPATIENCE IN THE BANKER'S VOICE NOW BUT A TONE OF DEEP FEELING CLEMENT AUSTIN LOCKED AT HIM
8410-278217-0066 HENRY DUNBAR SAW THE LOOK AND IT SEEMED AS IF HE ENDEAVOURED TO ANSWER IT YOU HAVE NO NEED TO BE SURPRISED THAT I SHRINK FROM SEEING MARGARET WILMOT HE SAID CANNOT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MY NERVES MAY BE NONE OF THE STRONGEST AND THAT I CANNOT ENDURE THE IDEA OF AN INTERVIEW WITH THIS GIRL WHO

8410-278217-0069 THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD VERY SIMPLE IN ALL THIS FOR A TIME AT LEAST CLEMENT AUSTIN'S MIND WAVERED MARGARET WAS PERHAPS WRONG AFTER ALL AND HENRY DUNBAR MIGHT BE AN INNOCENT MAN
8410-278217-0070 IT WAS CLEMENT WHO HAD INFORMED MARGARET OF MISTER DUNBAR'S EXPECTED PRESENCE HERE UPON THIS DAY AND IT WAS ON THE STRENGTH OF THAT INFORMATION THAT THE GIRL HAD COME TO SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE
8410-278217-0071 NO SOONER HAD THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR CLOSED UPON THE CASHIER THAN HENRY DUNBAR TURNED ABRUPTLY TO HIS JUNIOR PARTNER THERE IS A DOOR LEADING FROM THE YARD INTO A COURT THAT CONNECTS SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE WITH ANOTHER LANE AT THE BACK HE SAID IS THERE NOT

8410-278217-0073 HENRY DUNBAR OPENED IT WENT OUT INTO THE COURT AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
