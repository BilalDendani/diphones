6323-10337-0000 ONE WHETHER THERE IS NATURAL LOVE IN THE ANGELS TWO WHETHER THERE IS IN THEM LOVE OF CHOICE THREE WHETHER THE ANGEL LOVES HIMSELF WITH NATURAL LOVE OR WITH LOVE OF CHOICE FOUR
6323-10337-0001 WHETHER ONE ANGEL LOVES ANOTHER WITH NATURAL LOVE AS HE LOVES HIMSELF FIVE WHETHER THE ANGEL LOVES GOD MORE THAN SELF WITH NATURAL LOVE FIRST ARTICLE
6323-10337-0002 WHETHER THERE IS NATURAL LOVE OR DILECTION IN AN ANGEL OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE IS NO NATURAL LOVE OR DILECTION IN THE ANGELS FOR NATURAL LOVE IS CONTRADISTINGUISHED FROM INTELLECTUAL LOVE
6323-10337-0003 FURTHER THOSE WHO LOVE WITH NATURAL LOVE ARE MORE ACTED UPON THAN ACTIVE IN THEMSELVES FOR NOTHING HAS CONTROL OVER ITS OWN NATURE NOW THE ANGELS ARE NOT ACTED UPON BUT ACT OF THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY POSSESS FREE WILL AS WAS SHOWN ABOVE
6323-10337-0004 CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO NATURAL LOVE IN THEM
6323-10337-0005 FURTHER EVERY LOVE IS EITHER ORDINATE OR INORDINATE NOW ORDINATE LOVE BELONGS TO CHARITY WHILE INORDINATE LOVE BELONGS TO WICKEDNESS
6323-10337-0006 WHILE WICKEDNESS IS AGAINST NATURE THEREFORE THERE IS NO NATURAL LOVE IN THE ANGELS ON THE CONTRARY LOVE RESULTS FROM KNOWLEDGE
6323-10337-0007 ONE TWO BUT THERE IS NATURAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE ANGELS THEREFORE THERE IS ALSO NATURAL LOVE I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NECESSARILY PLACE NATURAL LOVE IN THE ANGELS IN EVIDENCE OF THIS WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT WHAT COMES FIRST IS ALWAYS SUSTAINED IN WHAT COMES AFTER IT
6323-10337-0008 NOW NATURE COMES BEFORE INTELLECT BECAUSE THE NATURE OF EVERY SUBJECT IS ITS ESSENCE CONSEQUENTLY WHATEVER BELONGS TO NATURE MUST BE PRESERVED LIKEWISE IN SUCH SUBJECTS AS HAVE INTELLECT BUT IT IS COMMON TO EVERY NATURE TO HAVE SOME INCLINATION
6323-10337-0009 AND THIS IS ITS NATURAL APPETITE OR LOVE THIS INCLINATION IS FOUND TO EXIST DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT NATURES BUT IN EACH ACCORDING TO ITS MODE CONSEQUENTLY IN THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE THERE IS TO BE FOUND A NATURAL INCLINATION COMING FROM THE WILL
6323-10337-0010 IN THE SENSITIVE NATURE ACCORDING TO THE SENSITIVE APPETITE BUT IN A NATURE DEVOID OF KNOWLEDGE ONLY ACCORDING TO THE TENDENCY OF THE NATURE TO SOMETHING THEREFORE SINCE AN ANGEL IS AN INTELLECTUAL NATURE
6323-10337-0011 INTELLECTUAL LOVE IS CONTRADISTINGUISHED FROM THAT NATURAL LOVE WHICH IS MERELY NATURAL IN SO FAR AS IT BELONGS TO A NATURE WHICH HAS NOT LIKEWISE THE PERFECTION OF EITHER SENSE OR INTELLECT
6323-10337-0012 WHO ACTS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT HE IS IN NO WAY MOVED TO ACT BY ANOTHER AND IN WHOM NATURE AND WILL ARE THE SAME SO THERE IS NOTHING UNFITTING IN AN ANGEL BEING MOVED TO ACT IN SO FAR AS SUCH
6323-10337-0013 AS NATURAL KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS TRUE SO IS NATURAL LOVE WELL REGULATED
6323-10337-0014 TO SAY THAT A NATURAL INCLINATION IS NOT WELL REGULATED IS TO DEROGATE FROM THE AUTHOR OF NATURE YET THE RECTITUDE OF NATURAL LOVE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE RECTITUDE OF CHARITY AND VIRTUE BECAUSE THE ONE RECTITUDE PERFECTS THE OTHER
6323-10337-0015 EVEN SO THE TRUTH OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE IS OF ONE KIND AND THE TRUTH OF INFUSED OR ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE IS OF ANOTHER SECOND ARTICLE
6323-10337-0016 QUESTION SIXTY ART TWO WHETHER THERE IS LOVE OF CHOICE IN THE ANGELS OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE IS NO LOVE OF CHOICE IN THE ANGELS FOR LOVE OF CHOICE APPEARS TO BE RATIONAL LOVE SINCE CHOICE FOLLOWS COUNSEL WHICH LIES IN INQUIRY
6323-10337-0017 NOW RATIONAL LOVE IS CONTRASTED WITH INTELLECTUAL WHICH IS PROPER TO ANGELS
6323-10337-0018 FURTHER THE ANGELS HAVE ONLY NATURAL KNOWLEDGE BESIDES SUCH AS IS INFUSED SINCE THEY DO NOT PROCEED FROM PRINCIPLES TO ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE OF CONCLUSIONS HENCE THEY ARE DISPOSED TO EVERYTHING THEY CAN KNOW AS OUR INTELLECT IS DISPOSED TOWARDS FIRST PRINCIPLES
6323-10337-0019 THERE IS ONLY NATURAL LOVE IN THE ANGELS THEREFORE THERE IS NO LOVE OF CHOICE IN THEM ON THE CONTRARY WE NEITHER MERIT NOR DEMERIT BY OUR NATURAL ACTS BUT BY THEIR LOVE THE ANGELS MERIT OR DEMERIT THEREFORE THERE IS LOVE OF CHOICE IN THEM
6323-10337-0020 I ANSWER THAT THERE EXISTS IN THE ANGELS A NATURAL LOVE AND A LOVE OF CHOICE THEIR NATURAL LOVE IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THEIR LOVE OF CHOICE BECAUSE WHAT BELONGS TO THAT WHICH PRECEDES HAS ALWAYS THE NATURE OF A PRINCIPLE
6323-10337-0021 WHEREFORE SINCE NATURE IS FIRST IN EVERYTHING WHAT BELONGS TO NATURE MUST BE A PRINCIPLE IN EVERYTHING THIS IS CLEARLY EVIDENT IN MAN WITH RESPECT TO BOTH HIS INTELLECT AND HIS WILL FOR THE INTELLECT KNOWS PRINCIPLES NATURALLY
6323-10337-0022 AND FROM SUCH KNOWLEDGE IN MAN COMES THE KNOWLEDGE OF CONCLUSIONS WHICH ARE KNOWN BY HIM NOT NATURALLY BUT BY DISCOVERY OR BY TEACHING IN LIKE MANNER THE END ACTS IN THE WILL IN THE SAME WAY AS THE PRINCIPLE DOES IN THE INTELLECT
6323-10337-0023 CONSEQUENTLY THE WILL TENDS NATURALLY TO ITS LAST END FOR EVERY MAN NATURALLY WILLS HAPPINESS AND ALL OTHER DESIRES ARE CAUSED BY THIS NATURAL DESIRE SINCE WHATEVER A MAN WILLS HE WILLS ON ACCOUNT OF THE END THEREFORE THE LOVE OF THAT GOOD WHICH A MAN NATURALLY WILLS AS AN END
6323-10337-0024 IS HIS NATURAL LOVE BUT THE LOVE WHICH COMES OF THIS WHICH IS OF SOMETHING LOVED FOR THE END'S SAKE IS THE LOVE OF CHOICE THERE IS HOWEVER A DIFFERENCE ON THE PART OF THE INTELLECT AND ON THE PART OF THE WILL BECAUSE AS WAS STATED ALREADY
6323-10337-0025 THE MIND'S KNOWLEDGE IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE INWARD PRESENCE OF THE KNOWN WITHIN THE KNOWER IT COMES OF THE IMPERFECTION OF MAN'S INTELLECTUAL NATURE THAT HIS MIND DOES NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY POSSESS ALL THINGS CAPABLE OF BEING UNDERSTOOD
6323-10337-0026 BUT ONLY A FEW THINGS FROM WHICH HE IS MOVED IN A MEASURE TO GRASP OTHER THINGS THE ACT OF THE APPETITIVE FACULTY ON THE CONTRARY FOLLOWS THE INCLINATION OF MAN TOWARDS THINGS SOME OF WHICH ARE GOOD IN THEMSELVES AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE APPETIBLE IN THEMSELVES
6323-10337-0027 OTHERS BEING GOOD ONLY IN RELATION TO SOMETHING ELSE AND BEING APPETIBLE ON ACCOUNT OF SOMETHING ELSE CONSEQUENTLY IT DOES NOT ARGUE IMPERFECTION IN THE PERSON DESIRING FOR HIM TO SEEK ONE THING NATURALLY AS HIS END
6323-10337-0028 AND SOMETHING ELSE FROM CHOICE AS ORDAINED TO SUCH END THEREFORE SINCE THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE OF THE ANGELS IS PERFECT ONLY NATURAL AND NOT DEDUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE FOUND IN THEM BUT THERE IS TO BE FOUND IN THEM BOTH NATURAL LOVE AND LOVE OF CHOICE
6323-10337-0029 SINCE NATURE IS NOT THE SUFFICIENT PRINCIPLE THEREOF
6323-10337-0030 NOT ALL LOVE OF CHOICE IS RATIONAL LOVE ACCORDING AS RATIONAL IS DISTINGUISHED FROM INTELLECTUAL LOVE FOR RATIONAL LOVE IS SO CALLED WHICH FOLLOWS DEDUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE
6323-10337-0031 AD ONE WHEN TREATING OF FREE WILL EVERY CHOICE DOES NOT FOLLOW A DISCURSIVE ACT OF THE REASON BUT ONLY HUMAN CHOICE CONSEQUENTLY THE CONCLUSION DOES NOT FOLLOW THE REPLY TO THE SECOND OBJECTION FOLLOWS FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID THIRD ARTICLE
6323-10337-0032 WHETHER THE ANGEL LOVES HIMSELF WITH BOTH NATURAL LOVE AND LOVE OF CHOICE OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE ANGEL DOES NOT LOVE HIMSELF BOTH WITH NATURAL LOVE AND A LOVE OF CHOICE
6323-10337-0033 NATURAL LOVE REGARDS THE END ITSELF WHILE LOVE OF CHOICE REGARDS THE MEANS TO THE END BUT THE SAME THING WITH REGARD TO THE SAME CANNOT BE BOTH THE END AND A MEANS TO THE END THEREFORE NATURAL LOVE AND THE LOVE OF CHOICE CANNOT HAVE THE SAME OBJECT
6323-10337-0034 BUT UNITING AND BINDING IMPLY VARIOUS THINGS BROUGHT TOGETHER THEREFORE THE ANGEL CANNOT LOVE HIMSELF
6323-10337-0035 FURTHER LOVE IS A KIND OF MOVEMENT BUT EVERY MOVEMENT TENDS TOWARDS SOMETHING ELSE THEREFORE IT SEEMS THAT AN ANGEL CANNOT LOVE HIMSELF
6323-10337-0036 ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS ETHIC IX
6323-10337-0037 EIGHT LOVE FOR OTHERS COMES OF LOVE FOR ONESELF I ANSWER THAT SINCE THE OBJECT OF LOVE IS GOOD AND GOOD IS TO BE FOUND BOTH IN SUBSTANCE AND IN ACCIDENT
6323-10337-0038 A THING MAY BE LOVED IN TWO WAYS FIRST OF ALL AS A SUBSISTING GOOD AND SECONDLY AS AN ACCIDENTAL OR INHERENT GOOD THAT IS LOVED AS A SUBSISTING GOOD
6323-10337-0039 BUT THAT WHICH WE WISH UNTO ANOTHER IS LOVED AS AN ACCIDENTAL OR INHERENT GOOD THUS KNOWLEDGE IS LOVED
6323-10337-0040 THIS KIND OF LOVE HAS BEEN CALLED BY THE NAME CONCUPISCENCE WHILE THE FIRST IS CALLED FRIENDSHIP
6323-10337-0041 EVERYTHING NATURALLY SEEKS TO PROCURE WHAT IS GOOD FOR ITSELF AS FIRE SEEKS TO MOUNT UPWARDS CONSEQUENTLY BOTH ANGEL AND MAN NATURALLY SEEK THEIR OWN GOOD AND PERFECTION THIS IS TO LOVE SELF
6323-10337-0042 HENCE ANGEL AND MAN NATURALLY LOVE SELF IN SO FAR AS BY NATURAL APPETITE EACH DESIRES WHAT IS GOOD FOR SELF ON THE OTHER HAND EACH LOVES SELF WITH THE LOVE OF CHOICE IN SO FAR AS FROM CHOICE HE WISHES FOR SOMETHING WHICH WILL BENEFIT HIMSELF
6323-10337-0043 IT IS NOT UNDER THE SAME BUT UNDER QUITE DIFFERENT ASPECTS THAT AN ANGEL OR A MAN LOVES SELF WITH NATURAL AND WITH ELECTIVE LOVE AS WAS OBSERVED ABOVE
6323-10337-0044 AS TO BE ONE IS BETTER THAN TO BE UNITED
6323-10337-0045 BUT DOES NOT OF NECESSITY TEND TOWARDS SOMETHING ELSE YET IT CAN BE REFLECTED BACK UPON THE LOVER SO THAT HE LOVES HIMSELF JUST AS KNOWLEDGE IS REFLECTED BACK UPON THE KNOWER IN SUCH A WAY THAT HE KNOWS HIMSELF FOURTH ARTICLE
6323-10337-0046 QUESTION SIXTY ART FOUR WHETHER AN ANGEL LOVES ANOTHER WITH NATURAL LOVE AS HE LOVES HIMSELF OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT AN ANGEL DOES NOT LOVE ANOTHER WITH NATURAL LOVE AS HE LOVES HIMSELF FOR LOVE FOLLOWS KNOWLEDGE
6323-10337-0047 BUT AN ANGEL DOES NOT KNOW ANOTHER AS HE KNOWS HIMSELF BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIMSELF BY HIS ESSENCE
6323-10337-0048 AS WAS SAID ABOVE QUESTION FIFTY SIX
6323-10337-0049 THEREFORE IT SEEMS THAT ONE ANGEL DOES NOT LOVE ANOTHER WITH NATURAL LOVE AS HE LOVES HIMSELF
6323-10337-0050 FURTHER THE CAUSE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE EFFECT AND THE PRINCIPLE THAN WHAT IS DERIVED FROM IT BUT LOVE FOR ANOTHER COMES OF LOVE FOR SELF AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS ETHIC
6323-10337-0051 THEREFORE ONE ANGEL DOES NOT LOVE ANOTHER AS HIMSELF BUT LOVES HIMSELF MORE
6323-10337-0052 FURTHER NATURAL LOVE IS OF SOMETHING AS AN END AND IS UNREMOVABLE BUT NO ANGEL IS THE END OF ANOTHER AND AGAIN SUCH LOVE CAN BE SEVERED FROM HIM AS IS THE CASE WITH THE DEMONS WHO HAVE NO LOVE FOR THE GOOD ANGELS
6323-10337-0053 THEREFORE AN ANGEL DOES NOT LOVE ANOTHER WITH NATURAL LOVE AS HE LOVES HIMSELF ON THE CONTRARY THAT SEEMS TO BE A NATURAL PROPERTY WHICH IS FOUND IN ALL EVEN IN SUCH AS DEVOID OF REASON BUT EVERY BEAST LOVES ITS LIKE AS IS SAID
6323-10337-0054 THIRTEEN NINETEEN THEREFORE AN ANGEL NATURALLY LOVES ANOTHER AS HE LOVES HIMSELF
6323-10337-0055 BOTH ANGEL AND MAN NATURALLY LOVE SELF NOW WHAT IS ONE WITH A THING IS THAT THING ITSELF CONSEQUENTLY EVERY THING LOVES WHAT IS ONE WITH ITSELF SO IF THIS BE ONE WITH IT BY NATURAL UNION IT LOVES IT WITH NATURAL LOVE
6323-10337-0056 BUT IF IT BE ONE WITH IT BY NON NATURAL UNION THEN IT LOVES IT WITH NON NATURAL LOVE THUS A MAN LOVES HIS FELLOW TOWNSMAN WITH A SOCIAL LOVE WHILE HE LOVES A BLOOD RELATION WITH NATURAL AFFECTION
6323-10337-0057 IN SO FAR AS HE IS ONE WITH HIM IN THE PRINCIPLE OF NATURAL GENERATION NOW IT IS EVIDENT THAT WHAT IS GENERICALLY OR SPECIFICALLY ONE WITH ANOTHER IS THE ONE ACCORDING TO NATURE AND SO EVERYTHING LOVES ANOTHER
6323-10337-0058 WHICH IS ONE WITH IT IN SPECIES WITH A NATURAL AFFECTION IN SO FAR AS IT LOVES ITS OWN SPECIES THIS IS MANIFEST EVEN IN THINGS DEVOID OF KNOWLEDGE FOR FIRE HAS A NATURAL INCLINATION TO COMMUNICATE ITS FORM TO ANOTHER THING
6323-10337-0059 NAMELY TO BE BORNE UPWARDS SO THEN IT MUST BE SAID THAT ONE ANGEL LOVES ANOTHER WITH NATURAL AFFECTION IN SO FAR AS HE IS ONE WITH HIM IN NATURE BUT SO FAR AS AN ANGEL HAS SOMETHING ELSE IN COMMON WITH ANOTHER ANGEL
6323-10337-0060 OR DIFFERS FROM HIM IN OTHER RESPECTS HE DOES NOT LOVE HIM WITH NATURAL LOVE
6323-10337-0061 THE EXPRESSION AS HIMSELF CAN IN ONE WAY QUALIFY THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE LOVE ON THE PART OF THE ONE KNOWN AND LOVED AND THUS ONE ANGEL KNOWS ANOTHER AS HIMSELF BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE OTHER TO BE EVEN AS HE KNOWS HIMSELF TO BE
6323-10337-0062 IN ANOTHER WAY THE EXPRESSION CAN QUALIFY THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE LOVE ON THE PART OF THE KNOWER AND LOVER AND THUS ONE ANGEL DOES NOT KNOW ANOTHER AS HIMSELF BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIMSELF BY HIS ESSENCE AND THE OTHER NOT BY THE OTHER'S ESSENCE
6323-10337-0063 IN LIKE MANNER HE DOES NOT LOVE ANOTHER AS HE LOVES HIMSELF BECAUSE HE LOVES HIMSELF BY HIS OWN WILL BUT HE DOES NOT LOVE ANOTHER BY THE OTHER'S WILL
6323-10337-0064 THE EXPRESSION AS DOES NOT DENOTE EQUALITY BUT LIKENESS FOR SINCE NATURAL AFFECTION RESTS UPON NATURAL UNITY THE ANGEL NATURALLY LOVES LESS WHAT IS LESS ONE WITH HIM
6323-10337-0065 CONSEQUENTLY HE LOVES MORE WHAT IS NUMERICALLY ONE WITH HIMSELF THAN WHAT IS ONE ONLY GENERICALLY OR SPECIFICALLY BUT IT IS NATURAL FOR HIM TO HAVE A LIKE LOVE FOR ANOTHER AS FOR HIMSELF IN THIS RESPECT
6323-10337-0066 THAT AS HE LOVES SELF IN WISHING WELL TO SELF SO HE LOVES ANOTHER IN WISHING WELL TO HIM
6323-10337-0067 NOT AS OF THAT END TO WHICH GOOD IS WILLED BUT RATHER AS OF THAT GOOD WHICH ONE WILLS FOR ONESELF AND IN CONSEQUENCE FOR ANOTHER AS UNITED TO ONESELF NOR CAN SUCH NATURAL LOVE BE STRIPPED FROM THE WICKED ANGELS
6323-10337-0068 WITHOUT THEIR STILL RETAINING A NATURAL AFFECTION TOWARDS THE GOOD ANGELS IN SO FAR AS THEY SHARE THE SAME NATURE WITH THEM BUT THEY HATE THEM IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE UNLIKE THEM ACCORDING TO RIGHTEOUSNESS AND UNRIGHTEOUSNESS FIFTH ARTICLE
6323-10337-0069 WHETHER AN ANGEL BY NATURAL LOVE LOVES GOD MORE THAN HE LOVES HIMSELF OBJECTION ONE
6323-10337-0070 NATURAL LOVE RESTS UPON NATURAL UNION NOW THE DIVINE NATURE IS FAR ABOVE THE ANGELIC NATURE THEREFORE ACCORDING TO NATURAL LOVE THE ANGEL LOVES GOD LESS THAN SELF OR EVEN THAN ANOTHER ANGEL
6323-10337-0071 BUT EVERY ONE LOVES ANOTHER WITH NATURAL LOVE FOR HIS OWN SAKE BECAUSE ONE THING LOVES ANOTHER AS GOOD FOR ITSELF THEREFORE THE ANGEL DOES NOT LOVE GOD MORE THAN SELF WITH NATURAL LOVE
6323-10337-0072 FURTHER NATURE IS SELF CENTERED IN ITS OPERATION FOR WE BEHOLD EVERY AGENT ACTING NATURALLY FOR ITS OWN PRESERVATION BUT NATURE'S OPERATION WOULD NOT BE SELF CENTERED WERE IT TO TEND TOWARDS ANYTHING ELSE MORE THAN TO NATURE ITSELF
6323-10337-0073 THEREFORE THE ANGEL DOES NOT LOVE GOD MORE THAN HIMSELF FROM NATURAL LOVE
6323-10337-0074 FURTHER IT IS PROPER TO CHARITY TO LOVE GOD MORE THAN SELF BUT TO LOVE FROM CHARITY IS NOT NATURAL TO THE ANGELS FOR IT IS POURED OUT UPON THEIR HEARTS BY THE HOLY SPIRIT WHO IS GIVEN TO THEM AS AUGUSTINE SAYS
6323-10337-0075 THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT LOVE GOD MORE THAN THEMSELVES BY NATURAL LOVE
6323-10337-0076 FURTHER NATURAL LOVE LASTS WHILE NATURE ENDURES BUT THE LOVE OF GOD MORE THAN SELF DOES NOT REMAIN IN THE ANGEL OR MAN WHO SINS
6323-10337-0077 TWO LOVES HAVE MADE TWO CITIES NAMELY LOVE OF SELF
6323-10337-0078 WHILE LOVE OF GOD UNTO THE CONTEMPT OF SELF HAS MADE THE HEAVENLY CITY
6323-10337-0079 BUT THE PRECEPT OF LOVING GOD MORE THAN SELF IS A MORAL PRECEPT OF THE LAW THEREFORE IT IS OF THE LAW OF NATURE CONSEQUENTLY FROM NATURAL LOVE THE ANGEL LOVES GOD MORE THAN HIMSELF I ANSWER THAT
6323-10337-0080 THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WHO MAINTAINED THAT AN ANGEL LOVES GOD MORE THAN HIMSELF WITH NATURAL LOVE BOTH AS TO THE LOVE OF CONCUPISCENCE THROUGH HIS SEEKING THE DIVINE GOOD FOR HIMSELF RATHER THAN HIS OWN GOOD AND IN A FASHION
6323-10337-0081 IN SO FAR AS HE NATURALLY DESIRES A GREATER GOOD TO GOD THAN TO HIMSELF BECAUSE HE NATURALLY WISHES GOD TO BE GOD WHILE AS FOR HIMSELF HE WILLS TO HAVE HIS OWN NATURE BUT ABSOLUTELY SPEAKING OUT OF THE NATURAL LOVE HE LOVES HIMSELF MORE THAN HE DOES GOD
6323-10337-0082 BECAUSE HE NATURALLY LOVES HIMSELF BEFORE GOD AND WITH GREATER INTENSITY THE FALSITY OF SUCH AN OPINION STANDS IN EVIDENCE IF ONE BUT CONSIDER WHITHER NATURAL MOVEMENT TENDS IN THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS BECAUSE THE NATURAL TENDENCY OF THINGS DEVOID OF REASON
6323-10337-0083 SHOWS THE NATURE OF THE NATURAL INCLINATION RESIDING IN THE WILL OF AN INTELLECTUAL NATURE NOW IN NATURAL THINGS EVERYTHING WHICH AS SUCH NATURALLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER IS PRINCIPALLY AND MORE STRONGLY INCLINED TO THAT OTHER TO WHICH IT BELONGS
6323-10337-0084 WE FIND THE SAME INCLINATION AMONG THE SOCIAL VIRTUES FOR IT BEHOOVES THE VIRTUOUS CITIZEN TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE DANGER OF DEATH FOR THE PUBLIC WEAL OF THE STATE AND IF MAN WERE A NATURAL PART OF THE CITY THEN SUCH INCLINATION WOULD BE NATURAL TO HIM
6323-10337-0085 CONSEQUENTLY SINCE GOD IS THE UNIVERSAL GOOD AND UNDER THIS GOOD BOTH MAN AND ANGEL AND ALL CREATURES ARE COMPRISED
6323-10337-0086 NATURALLY BELONGS TO GOD IT FOLLOWS THAT FROM NATURAL LOVE ANGEL AND MAN ALIKE LOVE GOD BEFORE THEMSELVES AND WITH A GREATER LOVE OTHERWISE IF EITHER OF THEM LOVED SELF MORE THAN GOD IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT NATURAL LOVE WOULD BE PERVERSE
6323-10337-0087 AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE PERFECTED BUT DESTROYED BY CHARITY
6323-10337-0088 SUCH REASONING HOLDS GOOD OF THINGS ADEQUATELY DIVIDED WHEREOF ONE IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE AND GOODNESS OF THE OTHER
6323-10337-0089 BUT WHERE ONE IS THE WHOLE CAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE AND GOODNESS OF THE OTHER THAT ONE IS NATURALLY MORE LOVED THAN SELF BECAUSE AS WE SAID ABOVE EACH PART NATURALLY LOVES THE WHOLE MORE THAN ITSELF AND EACH INDIVIDUAL NATURALLY LOVES THE GOOD OF THE SPECIES
6323-10337-0090 MORE THAN ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL GOOD NOW GOD IS NOT ONLY THE GOOD OF ONE SPECIES BUT IS ABSOLUTELY THE UNIVERSAL GOOD
6323-10337-0091 WHEN IT IS SAID THAT GOD IS LOVED BY AN ANGEL IN SO FAR AS HE IS GOOD TO THE ANGEL IF THE EXPRESSION IN SO FAR DENOTES AN END THEN IT IS FALSE FOR HE DOES NOT NATURALLY LOVE GOD FOR HIS OWN GOOD BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE
6323-10337-0092 IF IT DENOTES THE NATURE OF LOVE ON THE LOVER'S PART THEN IT IS TRUE
6323-10337-0093 EXCEPT FROM THIS THAT EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENT ON THAT GOOD WHICH IS GOD
6323-10337-0094 NATURE'S OPERATION IS SELF CENTERED NOT MERELY AS TO CERTAIN PARTICULAR DETAILS BUT MUCH MORE AS TO WHAT IS COMMON FOR EVERYTHING IS INCLINED TO PRESERVE NOT MERELY ITS INDIVIDUALITY BUT LIKEWISE ITS SPECIES
6323-10337-0095 AND MUCH MORE HAS EVERYTHING A NATURAL INCLINATION TOWARDS WHAT IS THE ABSOLUTELY UNIVERSAL GOOD
6323-10337-0096 IS LOVED BY EVERYTHING WITH NATURAL LOVE
6323-10337-0097 HE IS LOVE WITH THE LOVE OF CHARITY
6323-10337-0098 SINCE GOD'S SUBSTANCE AND UNIVERSAL GOODNESS ARE ONE AND THE SAME ALL WHO BEHOLD GOD'S ESSENCE ARE BY THE SAME MOVEMENT OF LOVE MOVED TOWARDS THE DIVINE ESSENCE AS IT IS DISTINCT FROM OTHER THINGS AND ACCORDING AS IT IS THE UNIVERSAL GOOD
6323-10337-0099 AND BECAUSE HE IS NATURALLY LOVED BY ALL SO FAR AS HE IS THE UNIVERSAL GOOD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT WHOEVER SEES HIM IN HIS ESSENCE SHOULD NOT LOVE HIM BUT SUCH AS DO NOT BEHOLD HIS ESSENCE KNOW HIM BY SOME PARTICULAR EFFECTS
6323-10337-0100 WHICH ARE SOMETIMES OPPOSED TO THEIR WILL
