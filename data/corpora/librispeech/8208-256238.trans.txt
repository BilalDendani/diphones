8208-256238-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN THE MONTH OF CHOEAK FROM THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER TO THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE WATERS OF THE NILE WERE HIGHEST AND BEGAN TO FALL SLIGHTLY IN THE GARDENS PEOPLE GATHERED TAMARINDS DATES OLIVES
8208-256238-0001 AND TREES BLOSSOMED A SECOND TIME AT THIS JUNCTURE
8208-256238-0002 AND WITH A GRAND SUITE ON SOME TENS OF STATELY BARGES
8208-256238-0003 TO THANK THE GODS THERE FOR THE BOUNTEOUS INUNDATION AND ALSO TO PLACE OFFERINGS ON THE TOMBS OF HIS ETERNALLY LIVING ANCESTORS THE MOST WORTHY RULER TOOK FAREWELL OF HIS HEIR VERY GRACIOUSLY BUT THE DIRECTION OF STATE AFFAIRS DURING HIS ABSENCE HE LEFT WITH HERHOR
8208-256238-0004 SO AS NOT TO MEET HERHOR OR ANNOY HIS OWN MOTHER WHOM HE CONSIDERED THE CAUSE OF HIS FAILURES ON THE FOLLOWING DAY TUTMOSIS VISITED HIM IN THIS RETREAT BRINGING TWO BOATS FILLED WITH MUSICIANS AND DANCERS AND A THIRD CONTAINING BASKETS OF FOOD AND FLOWERS
8208-256238-0005 WITH PITCHERS OF WINE BUT THE PRINCE COMMANDED THE MUSICIANS AND DANCERS TO DEPART AND TAKING TUTMOSIS TO THE GARDEN HE SAID OF COURSE MY MOTHER MAY SHE LIVE THROUGH ETERNITY SENT THEE TO SEPARATE ME FROM THE JEWESS
8208-256238-0006 TELL HER WORTHINESS THAT WERE HERHOR TO BECOME NOT MERELY VICEROY BUT THE SON OF MY FATHER I SHOULD DO THAT WHICH PLEASES ME I KNOW HOW TO DO IT TO DAY THEY WISH TO DEPRIVE ME OF SARAH AND TO MORROW THEY WOULD TAKE MY POWER FROM ME
8208-256238-0007 HOW CANST THOU WONDER IF THE PRIESTS ARE DISPLEASED BECAUSE THE HEIR TO THE THRONE HAS CONNECTED HIS LIFE WITH A WOMAN OF ANOTHER COUNTRY AND A STRANGE RELIGION SARAH DOES NOT PLEASE THEM ESPECIALLY SINCE THOU HAST HER ALONE
8208-256238-0008 HADST THOU A NUMBER OF VARIOUS WOMEN LIKE ALL NOBLE YOUTHS THEY WOULD NOT MIND THE JEWESS BUT HAVE THEY DONE HER HARM NO ON THE CONTRARY EVEN SOME PRIEST DEFENDED HER AGAINST A RAGING CROWD WHICH IT PLEASED THEE TO LIBERATE FROM IMPRISONMENT
8208-256238-0009 TUTMOSIS LAUGHED THY WORTHY MOTHER LOVES THEE AS HER OWN EYES AND HEART OF COURSE SARAH DOES NOT PLEASE HER EITHER
8208-256238-0010 THIS THAT I SHOULD ENTICE SARAH FROM THEE WHAT A JEST ON HER PART TO THIS I ANSWERED WITH A SECOND JEST RAMESES HAS GIVEN ME A BRACE OF HUNTING DOGS AND TWO SYRIAN HORSES BECAUSE HE HAS GROWN TIRED OF THEM
8208-256238-0011 PERHAPS SOME DAY HE WILL GIVE ME HIS MISTRESS TOO OF COURSE I SHALL HAVE TO TAKE HER WITH OTHER THINGS DO NOT THINK OF IT I WOULD NOT GIVE SARAH TO ANY MAN WERE IT ONLY FOR THIS BECAUSE OF HER MY FATHER HAS NOT APPOINTED ME VICEROY TUTMOSIS SHOOK HIS HEAD
8208-256238-0012 SO MUCH MISTAKEN THAT I AM TERRIFIED DOST THOU NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF THE DISFAVOR EVERY ENLIGHTENED EGYPTIAN KNOWS THEM I KNOW NOTHING SO MUCH THE WORSE SAID THE ANXIOUS TUTMOSIS
8208-256238-0013 THOU DOST NOT KNOW THEN THAT WARRIORS SINCE THE MANOEUVRES ESPECIALLY GREEK WARRIORS DRINK THY HEALTH IN EVERY DRAMSHOP THEY GOT MONEY TO DO SO TRUE BUT NOT TO CRY OUT WITH ALL THE VOICE THAT IS IN THEM
8208-256238-0014 THAT WHEN THOU SHALT SUCCEED TO HIS HOLINESS MAY HE LIVE THROUGH ETERNITY THOU WILT BEGIN A GREAT WAR AFTER WHICH THERE WILL BE CHANGES IN EGYPT WHAT CHANGES AND WHO IS THE MAN WHO DURING THE LIFE OF THE PHARAOH MAY DARE TO SPEAK OF THE PLANS OF HIS SUCCESSOR NOW THE PRINCE GREW GLOOMY
8208-256238-0015 THAT IS ONE THING BUT I WILL TELL THEE ANOTHER SAID TUTMOSIS FOR MISFORTUNES LIKE HYENAS NEVER COME SINGLY DOST THOU KNOW THAT THE LOWEST PEOPLE SING SONGS ABOUT THEE SING HOW THOU DIDST FREE THE ATTACKERS FROM PRISON
8208-256238-0016 OR EGYPT IS DIVIDED INTO AS MANY PARTS AS THERE ARE NOMARCHS FINALLY JUDGE FOR THYSELF IS IT PROPER THAT ANY MAN'S NAME SHOULD BE MENTIONED OFTENER THAN THE PHARAOH'S AND THAT ANY MAN SHOULD STAND BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND OUR LORD IF THOU PERMIT
8208-256238-0017 WHEN THE MOON FOLLOWS THE GOD OF LIGHT FROM AFAR WE HAVE BRIGHTNESS IN THE DAYTIME AND CLEARNESS AT NIGHT WHEN THE MOON WISHES TO BE TOO NEAR THE SUN IT DISAPPEARS ITSELF AND THE NIGHTS ARE DARK BUT IF THE MOON STANDS BEFORE THE SUN THERE IS AN ECLIPSE
8208-256238-0018 AND IN THE WORLD GREAT TERROR AND ALL THIS BABBLE INTERRUPTED RAMESES GOES TO THE EARS OF HIS HOLINESS MISFORTUNE ON MY HEAD WOULD THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN THE SON OF A PHARAOH THE PHARAOH AS A GOD UPON EARTH KNOWS EVERYTHING
8208-256238-0019 BUT HE IS TOO MIGHTY TO CARE FOR THE DRUNKEN SHOUTS OF SOLDIERS OR THE WHISPERS OF EARTH TILLERS HE UNDERSTANDS THAT EVERY EGYPTIAN WOULD DIE FOR HIM AND THOU FIRST OF ALL THOU HAST SPOKEN TRUTH ANSWERED THE ANXIOUS PRINCE
8208-256238-0020 BUT IN ALL THIS I SEE NEW VILENESS AND DECEIT OF THE PRIESTS ADDED HE ROUSING HIMSELF IT IS I THEN WHO HIDE THE MAJESTY OF OUR LORD BECAUSE I FREE THE INNOCENT FROM PRISON OR DO NOT LET MY TENANT TORTURE EARTH WORKERS WITH UNJUST TRIBUTE
8208-256238-0021 BUT WHEN HIS WORTHINESS HERHOR MANAGES THE ARMY APPOINTS LEADERS NEGOTIATES WITH FOREIGN PRINCES AND DIRECTS MY FATHER TO SPEND HIS TIME IN PRAYERS TUTMOSIS COVERED HIS EARS AND STAMPING CRIED BE SILENT BE SILENT
8208-256238-0022 AND WHATEVER IS DONE ON EARTH PROCEEDS FROM HIS WILL HERHOR IS A SERVANT OF THE PHARAOH AND DOES WHAT HIS LORD ENJOINS ON HIM IF THOU WILT CONVINCE THYSELF
8208-256238-0023 THE PRINCE GREW SO GLOOMY THAT TUTMOSIS BROKE OFF THE CONVERSATION AND TOOK FAREWELL OF HIS FRIEND AT THE EARLIEST WHEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS BOAT WHICH WAS FURNISHED WITH A BALDACHIN AND CURTAINS HE DREW A DEEP BREATH
8208-256238-0024 I THANK THE GODS FOR NOT GIVING ME SUCH A CHARACTER AS THAT WHICH RAMESES HAS
8208-256238-0025 HE MIGHT HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN MEMPHIS BUT HE STICKS TO ONE TO ANNOY HIS MOTHER MEANWHILE IT IS NOT HIS MOTHER THAT HE ANNOYS BUT ALL THE VIRTUOUS VIRGINS AND FAITHFUL WIVES WHO ARE WITHERING FROM SADNESS THAT THE HEIR TO THE THRONE
8208-256238-0026 AND MOREOVER A YOUTH OF GREAT COMELINESS DOES NOT SNATCH FROM THEM VIRTUE
8208-256238-0027 HE MIGHT NOT ONLY DRINK BUT EVEN SWIM IN THE BEST WINE MEANWHILE HE PREFERS THE WRETCHED CAMP BEER AND BREAD RUBBED WITH GARLIC WHENCE CAME THESE LOW INCLINATIONS I CANNOT IMAGINE
8208-256238-0028 OR WAS IT THAT THE WORTHY NIKOTRIS IN HER CRITICAL PERIOD LOOKED AT WORKMEN WHILE THEY WERE EATING HE MIGHT DO NOTHING FROM DAYLIGHT TILL DARKNESS IF HE WISHED THE MOST FAMOUS LORDS WITH THEIR WIVES SISTERS AND DAUGHTERS WOULD SERVE FOOD TO HIM
8208-256238-0029 HE NOT ONLY STRETCHES FORTH HIS OWN HANDS TO TAKE FOOD BUT TO THE TORMENT OF OUR NOBLE YOUTHS HE WASHES HIMSELF DRESSES HIMSELF AND HIS BARBER SPENDS WHOLE DAYS IN SNARING BIRDS AND THUS WASTES HIS ABILITIES
8208-256238-0030 OH HOW HAPPY I AM THAT I NEED NOT DIVINE WHAT THEY ARE THINKING OF IN TYRE OR NINEVEH BREAK MY HEAD OVER WAGES FOR THE ARMY CALCULATE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ADDED TO EGYPT OR TAKEN FROM IT AND WHAT RENTS MUST BE COLLECTED
8208-256238-0031 IT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY TO ONE'S SELF MY TENANT DOES NOT PAY WHAT I NEED AND EXPEND BUT WHAT THE INCREASE OF THE NILE PERMITS THUS MEDITATED THE EXQUISITE TUTMOSIS WHILE HE STRENGTHENED HIS ANXIOUS SOUL WITH GOLDEN WINE
8208-256238-0032 BEFORE THE BOAT HAD SAILED UP TO MEMPHIS HEAVY SLEEP HAD MASTERED HIM IN SUCH WISE THAT HIS SLAVES HAD TO CARRY THEIR LORD TO THE LITTER AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF TUTMOSIS WHICH RESEMBLED A FLIGHT THE HEIR FELL TO THINKING DEEPLY
8208-256238-0033 AND THE ALL COMMANDING LORD OF THIS WORLD WAS REALLY JUST SUCH A PERSON AS OTHERS ONLY A LITTLE MORE WEAKLY THAN ORDINARY OLD MEN AND VERY MUCH LIMITED IN POWER BY THE PRIESTLY ORDER THE PRINCE SAW ALL THIS AND JEERED IN HIS SOUL
8208-256238-0034 AND EVEN IN PUBLIC AT MANY THINGS BUT ALL HIS INFIDELITY FELL BEFORE THE ACTUAL TRUTH THAT NO ONE WAS PERMITTED TO TRIFLE WITH THE TITLES OF THE PHARAOH RAMESES KNEW THE HISTORY OF HIS COUNTRY AND HE REMEMBERED THAT IN EGYPT MANY THINGS WERE FORGIVEN THE MIGHTY
8208-256238-0035 KILL A MAN IN SECRET REVILE THE GODS PRIVATELY TAKE PRESENTS FROM AMBASSADORS OF FOREIGN STATES BUT TWO SINS WERE NOT FORGIVEN THE BETRAYAL OF PRIESTLY SECRETS AND TREASON TO THE PHARAOH A MAN WHO COMMITTED ONE OR THE OTHER DISAPPEARED
8208-256238-0036 BUT WHERE HE HAD BEEN PUT OR WHAT HAD BEEN DONE WITH HIM NO ONE EVEN DARED TO MENTION
8208-256238-0037 FROM THE TIME THAT THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO MENTION HIS NAME AND SPEAK OF CERTAIN PLANS OF HIS CHANGES IN THE STATE FUTURE WARS THINKING OF THIS THE PRINCE FELT AS IF A NAMELESS CROWD OF REBELS AND UNFORTUNATES WERE PUSHING HIM VIOLENTLY TO THE POINT OF THE HIGHEST OBELISK
8208-256238-0038 FROM WHICH HE MUST TUMBLE DOWN AND BE CRUSHED INTO JELLY LATER ON WHEN AFTER THE LONGEST LIFE OF HIS FATHER POSSIBLE HE BECAME PHARAOH HE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT AND THE MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH MANY DEEDS OF WHICH NO ONE IN EGYPT COULD EVEN THINK WITHOUT TERROR
8208-256238-0039 BUT TO DAY HE MUST IN TRUTH HAVE A CARE LEST THEY DECLARE HIM A TRAITOR AND A REBEL AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF EGYPT IN THAT STATE THERE WAS ONE VISIBLE RULER THE PHARAOH
8208-256238-0040 NO CHANGES COULD COME SAVE FROM THAT PLACE THERE BURNED THE ONLY VISIBLE LAMP OF POLITICAL WISDOM THE LIGHT OF WHICH ILLUMINATED EGYPT BUT TOUCHING THAT LIGHT IT WAS SAFER TO BE SILENT
8208-256238-0041 ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS FLEW THROUGH THE PRINCE'S HEAD WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF A WHIRLWIND
8208-256238-0042 UNDER THE CHESTNUT TREE IN SARAH'S GARDEN AND LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE THERE AROUND HIM THE WATER OF THE NILE HAD FALLEN A LITTLE AND HAD BEGUN TO GROW AS TRANSPARENT AS A CRYSTAL BUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY LOOKED YET LIKE AN ARM OF THE SEA
8208-256238-0043 THICKLY DOTTED WITH ISLANDS ON WHICH ROSE BUILDINGS GARDENS AND ORCHARDS WHILE HERE AND THERE GROUPS OF GREAT TREES SERVED AS ORNAMENT AROUND ALL THESE ISLANDS WERE WELL SWEEPS WITH BUCKETS BY WHICH BRONZE HUED NAKED MEN WITH DIRTY BREECH CLOUTS
8208-256238-0044 RAISED WATER FROM THE NILE AND POURED IT INTO HIGHER RESERVOIRS ONE SUCH PLACE WAS IN THE PRINCE'S MIND ESPECIALLY THAT WAS A STEEP EMINENCE ON THE SIDE OF WHICH THREE MEN WERE WORKING AT THREE WELL SWEEPS ONE
8208-256238-0045 DREW WATER IN BUCKETS AND IRRIGATED BEDS OF VEGETABLES OR WATERED TREES FROM SPRINKLING POTS THE MOVEMENT OF THE SWEEPS GOING DOWN AND RISING THE TURN OF THE BUCKETS THE GUSHING OF THE POTS WAS SO RHYTHMIC
8208-256238-0046 HE MERELY BENT AND ROSE IN ONE SINGLE METHOD FROM DAYLIGHT UNTIL EVENING FROM ONE MONTH TO ANOTHER AND DOUBTLESS HE HAD WORKED THUS FROM CHILDHOOD AND WOULD SO WORK TILL DEATH TOOK HIM
8208-256238-0047 AND CREATURES SUCH AS THESE THOUGHT THE PRINCE AS HE LOOKED AT THEIR TOIL DESIRE ME TO REALIZE THEIR IMAGININGS WHAT CHANGE IN THE STATE CAN THEY WISH IS IT THAT HE WHO DRAWS FROM THE LOWEST WELL SHOULD GO TO THE HIGHEST
8208-256238-0048 OR INSTEAD OF POURING FROM A BUCKET SHOULD SPRINKLE TREES WITH A WATERING POT ANGER ROSE TO HIS HEAD AND HUMILIATION CRUSHED HIM BECAUSE HE THE HEIR TO THE THRONE THANKS TO THE FABLES OF CREATURES LIKE THOSE WHO NODDED ALL THEIR LIVES OVER WELLS OF DIRTY WATER
8208-256238-0049 WAS NOT NOW THE VICE PHARAOH AT THAT MOMENT HE HEARD A LOW RUSTLE AMONG THE TREES AND DELICATE HANDS RESTED ON HIS SHOULDER WELL SARAH ASKED THE PRINCE WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD THOU ART SAD MY LORD
8208-256238-0050 AND I HAVE NOT SEEN THY SMILE YET THOU DOST NOT EVEN SPEAK TO ME BUT MOVEST ABOUT IN GLOOM AND AT NIGHT THOU DOST NOT FONDLE ME BUT ONLY SIGHEST I HAVE TROUBLE
8208-256238-0051 GRIEF IS LIKE A TREASURE GIVEN TO BE GUARDED AS LONG AS WE GUARD IT OURSELVES EVEN SLEEP FLEES AWAY
8208-256238-0052 RAMESES EMBRACED SARAH AND SEATED HER ON THE BENCH AT HIS SIDE
8208-256238-0053 SAID HE SMILING IS UNABLE TO BRING IN ALL HIS CROPS FROM THE FIELD BEFORE THE OVERFLOW HIS WIFE HELPS HIM SHE HELPS HIM TO MILK COWS TOO SHE TAKES OUT FOOD TO THE FIELD FOR HIM SHE WASHES THE MAN ON HIS RETURN FROM LABOR
8208-256238-0054 HENCE THE BELIEF HAS COME THAT WOMAN CAN LIGHTEN MAN'S TROUBLES DOST THOU NOT BELIEVE THIS LORD THE CARES OF A PRINCE ANSWERED RAMESES CANNOT BE LIGHTENED BY A WOMAN EVEN BY ONE AS WISE AND POWERFUL AS MY MOTHER
8208-256238-0055 IN GOD'S NAME WHAT ARE THY TROUBLES TELL ME INSISTED SARAH
8208-256238-0056 ACCORDING TO OUR TRADITIONS ADAM LEFT PARADISE FOR EVE AND HE WAS SURELY THE GREATEST KING IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL KINGDOM THE PRINCE BECAME THOUGHTFUL OUR SAGES ALSO TEACH SAID HE THAT MAN HAS OFTEN ABANDONED DIGNITIES FOR WOMAN
8208-256238-0057 BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN HEARD THAT ANY MAN EVER ACHIEVED SOMETHING GREAT THROUGH A WOMAN UNLESS HE WAS A LEADER TO WHOM A PHARAOH GAVE HIS DAUGHTER WITH A GREAT DOWRY AND HIGH OFFICE BUT A WOMAN CANNOT HELP A MAN TO REACH A HIGHER PLACE OR EVEN HELP HIM OUT OF TROUBLES
8208-256238-0058 THIS MAY BE BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT LOVE AS I DO WHISPERED SARAH THY LOVE FOR ME IS WONDERFUL I KNOW THAT NEVER HAST THOU ASKED FOR GIFTS OR FAVORED THOSE WHO DO NOT HESITATE TO SEEK SUCCESS EVEN UNDER THE BEDS OF PRINCES FAVORITES
8208-256238-0059 THOU ART MILDER THAN A LAMB AND AS CALM AS A NIGHT ON THE NILE THY KISSES ARE LIKE PERFUME FROM THE LAND OF PUNT
8208-256238-0060 I HAVE NO MEASURE FOR THY BEAUTY OR WORDS FOR THY ATTRACTIONS THOU ART A MARVEL AMONG WOMEN WOMEN'S LIPS ARE RICH IN TROUBLE AND THEIR LOVE IS VERY COSTLY BUT WITH ALL THY PERFECTION HOW CANST THOU EASE MY TROUBLES
8208-256238-0061 CANST THOU CAUSE HIS HOLINESS TO ORDER A GREAT EXPEDITION TO THE EAST AND NAME ME TO COMMAND IT CANST THOU GIVE ME THE ARMY CORPS IN MEMPHIS FOR WHICH I ASKED OR WILT THOU IN THE PHARAOH'S NAME MAKE ME GOVERNOR OF LOWER EGYPT
8208-256238-0062 OR CANST THOU BRING ALL SUBJECTS OF HIS HOLINESS TO THINK AND FEEL AS I HIS MOST DEVOTED SUBJECT SARAH DROPPED HER HANDS ON HER KNEES AND WHISPERED SADLY TRUE I CANNOT DO THOSE THINGS I CAN DO NOTHING
8208-256238-0063 THOU CANST DO MUCH THOU CANST CHEER ME
8208-256238-0064 I KNOW THAT THOU HAST LEARNED TO DANCE AND SING TAKE OFF THOSE LONG ROBES THEREFORE WHICH BECOME PRIESTESSES
8208-256238-0065 AND ARRAY THYSELF IN TRANSPARENT MUSLIN AS PHOENICIAN DANCERS DO AND SO DANCE AND FONDLE ME AS THEY SARAH SEIZED HIS HANDS AND CRIED WITH FLAMING EYES HAST THOU TO DO WITH OUTCASTS SUCH AS THESE TELL ME LET ME KNOW MY WRETCHEDNESS
8208-256238-0066 SEND ME THEN TO MY FATHER SEND ME TO OUR VALLEY IN THE DESERT OH THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN THEE IN IT WELL WELL CALM THYSELF SAID THE PRINCE TOYING WITH HER HAIR I MUST OF COURSE SEE DANCERS IF NOT AT FEASTS AT ROYAL FESTIVALS
8208-256238-0067 OR DURING SERVICES IN TEMPLES BUT ALL OF THEM TOGETHER DO NOT CONCERN ME AS MUCH AS THOU ALONE MOREOVER WHO AMONG THEM COULD EQUAL THEE
8208-256238-0068 CUT OUT OF IVORY AND EACH OF THOSE DANCERS HAS SOME DEFECT SOME ARE TOO THICK OTHERS HAVE THIN LEGS OR UGLY HANDS STILL OTHERS HAVE FALSE HAIR WHO OF THEM IS LIKE THEE IF THOU WERT AN EGYPTIAN
8208-256238-0069 ALL OUR TEMPLES WOULD STRIVE TO POSSESS THEE AS THE LEADER OF THEIR CHORUS WHAT DO I SAY WERT THOU TO APPEAR NOW IN MEMPHIS IN TRANSPARENT ROBES THE PRIESTS WOULD BE GLAD IF THOU WOULDST TAKE PART IN PROCESSIONS
8208-256238-0070 IT IS NOT PERMITTED US DAUGHTERS OF JUDAH TO WEAR IMMODEST GARMENTS NOR TO DANCE OR SING WHY DIDST THOU LEARN THEN OUR WOMEN DANCE AND OUR VIRGINS SING BY THEMSELVES FOR THE GLORY OF THE LORD
8208-256238-0071 BUT NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SOWING FIERY SEEDS OF DESIRE IN MEN'S HEARTS BUT WE SING WAIT MY LORD I WILL SING TO THEE SHE ROSE FROM THE BENCH AND WENT TOWARD THE HOUSE SOON SHE RETURNED FOLLOWED BY A YOUNG GIRL WITH BLACK FRIGHTENED EYES
8208-256238-0072 WHO WAS BEARING A HARP WHO IS THIS MAIDEN ASKED THE PRINCE BUT WAIT I HAVE SEEN THAT LOOK SOMEWHERE AH WHEN I WAS HERE THE LAST TIME A FRIGHTENED GIRL LOOKED FROM THE BUSHES AT ME THIS IS ESTHER
8208-256238-0073 SHE HAS LIVED WITH ME A MONTH NOW BUT SHE FEARS THEE LORD SO SHE RUNS AWAY ALWAYS PERHAPS SHE LOOKED AT THEE SOMETIME FROM OUT THE BUSHES THOU MAYST GO MY CHILD SAID THE PRINCE TO THE MAIDEN WHO SEEMED PETRIFIED AND WHEN SHE HAD HIDDEN BEHIND THE BUSHES HE ASKED
8208-256238-0074 IS SHE A JEWESS TOO AND THIS GUARD OF THY HOUSE WHO LOOKS AT ME AS A SHEEP AT A CROCODILE THAT IS SAMUEL THE SON OF ESDRAS HE ALSO IS A RELATIVE I TOOK HIM IN PLACE OF THE BLACK MAN TO WHOM THOU HAST GIVEN FREEDOM
8208-256238-0075 BUT HAST THOU NOT PERMITTED ME TO CHOOSE MY SERVANTS THAT IS TRUE AND SO ALSO THE OVERSEER OF THE WORKMEN IS A JEW FOR HE HAS A YELLOW COMPLEXION AND LOOKS WITH A LOWLINESS WHICH NO EGYPTIAN COULD IMITATE
8208-256238-0076 ANSWERED SARAH IS EZECHIEL THE SON OF REUBEN A RELATIVE OF MY FATHER DOES HE NOT PLEASE THEE MY LORD THESE ARE ALL THY VERY FAITHFUL SERVANTS DOES HE PLEASE ME SAID THE PRINCE DISSATISFIED DRUMMING WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE BENCH
8208-256238-0077 WHERE IS HE WHO HAS NO CARE WHO IS HE WHO IN LYING DOWN TO SLUMBER HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY THIS IS A DAY THAT I HAVE SPENT WITHOUT SORROW WHERE IS THE MAN WHO LYING DOWN FOR THE GRAVE CAN SAY
8208-256238-0078 MY LIFE HAS PASSED WITHOUT PAIN WITHOUT FEAR LIKE A CALM EVENING ON THE JORDAN BUT HOW MANY ARE THERE WHO MOISTEN THEIR BREAD WITH TEARS DAILY AND WHOSE HOUSES ARE FILLED WITH SIGHING A WAIL IS MAN'S EARLIEST SPEECH ON THIS EARTH
8208-256238-0079 AND A GROAN HIS FAREWELL TO IT FULL OF SUFFERING DOES HE COME INTO LIFE FULL OF SORROW DOES HE GO TO HIS RESTING PLACE AND NO ONE ASKS HIM WHERE HE WOULD LIKE TO BE WHERE IS THAT OFFSPRING OF MAN WHO HAS NOT TASTED THE BITTERNESS OF BEING
8208-256238-0080 IS IT THE CHILD WHICH DEATH HAS SNATCHED FROM ITS MOTHER OR IS IT THE BABE WHOSE MOTHER'S BREAST WAS DRAINED BY HUNGER ERE THE LITTLE ONE COULD PLACE LIPS TO IT
8208-256238-0081 THE MAN WHO CAN LOOK WITH UNFAILING EYE AT THE MORROW DOES HE WHO TOILS ON THE FIELD KNOW THAT RAIN IS NOT UNDER HIS POWER AND THAT NOT HE SHOWS ITS WAY TO THE LOCUST SWARM DOES THE MERCHANT WHO GIVES HIS WEALTH TO THE WINDS WHICH COME HE KNOWS NOT WHENCE
8208-256238-0082 AND HIS LIFE TO THE WAVES ON THAT ABYSS WHICH SWALLOWS ALL AND RETURNS NOTHING WHERE IS THE MAN WITHOUT DREAD IN HIS SPIRIT IS IT THE HUNTER WHO CHASES THE NIMBLE DEER AND ON THE ROAD MEETS A LION WHICH MOCKS AT HIS ARROWS
8208-256238-0083 IS IT THE WARRIOR WHO GOES FORTH TO GAIN GLORY WITH TOILING AND MEETS A FOREST OF SHARP LANCES AND BRONZE SWORDS WHICH ARE THIRSTING FOR HIS LIFE BLOOD IS IT THE GREAT KING WHO UNDER HIS PURPLE PUTS ON HEAVY ARMOR WHO SPIES OUT WITH SLEEPLESS EYE THE TREACHERY OF OVERPOWERING NEIGHBORS
8208-256238-0084 AND SEIZES WITH HIS EAR THE RUSTLE OF THE CURTAIN LEST TREASON OVERTURN HIM IN HIS OWN TENT FOR THIS REASON MEN'S HEARTS IN ALL PLACES AND AT ALL TIMES ARE OVERFLOWING WITH SADNESS IN THE DESERT THE LION AND THE SCORPION ARE HIS DANGER
8208-256238-0085 IN THE CAVE LURKS THE DRAGON AMONG FLOWERS THE POISONOUS SERPENT IN THE SUNSHINE A GREEDY NEIGHBOR IS THINKING HOW TO DECREASE HIS LAND IN THE NIGHT THE ACTIVE THIEF IS BREAKING THROUGH THE DOOR TO HIS GRANARY IN CHILDHOOD HE IS INCOMPETENT IN OLD AGE STRIPPED OF STRENGTH
8208-256238-0086 WHEN FULL OF POWER HE IS SURROUNDED BY PERILS AS A WHALE IS SURROUNDED BY ABYSSES OF WATER THEREFORE O LORD MY CREATOR TO THEE THE TORTURED HUMAN SOUL TURNS ITSELF THOU HAST BROUGHT IT INTO A WORLD FULL OF AMBUSHES
8208-256238-0087 THOU HAST GRAFTED INTO IT THE TERROR OF EXTINCTION THOU HAST BARRED BEFORE IT ALL ROADS OF PEACE SAVE THE ONE ROAD WHICH LEADS TO THEE AND AS A CHILD WHICH CANNOT WALK GRASPS ITS MOTHER'S SKIRT LEST IT FALL
8208-256238-0088 AND STRUGGLES OUT OF UNCERTAINTY SARAH WAS SILENT THE PRINCE FELL INTO MEDITATION AND THEN SAID YE JEWS ARE A GLOOMY NATION IF MEN IN EGYPT BELIEVED AS THY SONG TEACHES
8208-256238-0089 WHEN HE RUSHED AMONG TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HOSTILE CHARIOTS EACH OF WHICH CARRIED THREE WARRIORS ONLY THEN DID AMON THE ETERNAL FATHER REACH HIS HAND DOWN AND END THE BATTLE WITH VICTORY BUT IF INSTEAD OF FIGHTING HE HAD WAITED FOR THE AID OF YOUR GOD
8208-256238-0090 LONG AGO WOULD THE EGYPTIANS HAVE BEEN MOVING ALONG THE NILE EACH OF THEM BEARING A BRICK AND A BUCKET WHILE THE VILE HITTITES WOULD BE MASTERS GOING AROUND WITH CLUBS AND PAPYRUSES THEREFORE SARAH THY CHARMS WILL SCATTER MY SORROWS SOONER THAN THY SONG
8208-256238-0091 IF I HAD ACTED AS YOUR JEWISH SONG TEACHES AND WAITED FOR DIVINE ASSISTANCE WINE WOULD HAVE FLOWED AWAY FROM MY LIPS AND WOMEN WOULD HAVE FLED FROM MY HOUSEHOLD ABOVE ALL I COULD NOT BE THE PHARAOH'S HEIR ANY MORE THAN MY BROTHERS
