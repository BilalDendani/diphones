6707-73028-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO DESOLATION IN THE MEANTIME THERE WAS GRIEF DOWN AT THE GREAT HOUSE OF CLAVERING AND GRIEF WE MUST SUPPOSE ALSO AT THE HOUSE IN BERKELEY SQUARE
6707-73028-0001 AS SOON AS THE NEWS FROM HIS COUNTRY HOME HAD REACHED SIR HUGH CLAVERING LITTLE HUGHY HIS HEIR WAS DEAD
6707-73028-0002 EARLY ONE MORNING MISSUS CLAVERING AT THE RECTORY RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM LADY CLAVERING BEGGING THAT SHE WOULD GO UP TO THE HOUSE AND ON ARRIVING THERE SHE FOUND THAT THE POOR CHILD WAS VERY ILL
6707-73028-0003 THE DOCTOR WAS THEN AT CLAVERING AND HAD RECOMMENDED THAT A MESSAGE SHOULD BE SENT TO THE FATHER IN LONDON BEGGING HIM TO COME DOWN THIS MESSAGE HAD BEEN ALREADY DESPATCHED WHEN MISSUS CLAVERING ARRIVED
6707-73028-0004 THE POOR MOTHER WAS IN A STATE OF TERRIBLE AGONY BUT AT THAT TIME THERE WAS YET HOPE MISSUS CLAVERING THEN REMAINED WITH LADY CLAVERING FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT JUST BEFORE DINNER ON THE SAME DAY
6707-73028-0005 ANOTHER MESSENGER CAME ACROSS TO SAY THAT HOPE WAS PAST AND THAT THE CHILD HAD GONE COULD MISSUS CLAVERING COME OVER AGAIN AS LADY CLAVERING WAS IN A SAD WAY
6707-73028-0006 NO I THINK NOT I SHALL WISH TO MAKE HER TAKE SOMETHING AND I CAN DO IT BETTER IF I ASK FOR TEA FOR MYSELF I WILL GO AT ONCE POOR DEAR LITTLE BOY IT WAS A BLOW I ALWAYS FEARED
6707-73028-0007 SAID THE RECTOR TO HIS DAUGHTER AS SOON AS HIS WIFE HAD LEFT THEM INDEED I KNEW THAT IT WAS COMING AND SHE WAS ALWAYS FEARING IT SAID FANNY BUT I DO NOT THINK HE DID HE NEVER SEEMS TO THINK THAT EVIL WILL COME TO HIM
6707-73028-0008 HE WILL FEEL THIS SAID THE RECTOR FEEL IT PAPA OF COURSE HE WILL FEEL IT
6707-73028-0009 WHO EVER HEARD HIM SAY A SOFT WORD TO HIS WIFE BUT HE WILL FEEL IT NOW FOR THIS CHILD WAS HIS HEIR HE WILL BE HIT HARD NOW AND I PITY HIM
6707-73028-0010 MISSUS CLAVERING WENT ACROSS THE PARK ALONE AND SOON FOUND HERSELF IN THE POOR BEREAVED MOTHER'S ROOM SHE WAS SITTING BY HERSELF HAVING DRIVEN THE OLD HOUSE KEEPER AWAY FROM HER
6707-73028-0011 AND THERE WERE NO TRACES OF TEARS THEN ON HER FACE THOUGH SHE HAD WEPT PLENTIFULLY WHEN MISSUS CLAVERING HAD BEEN WITH HER IN THE MORNING
6707-73028-0012 WHICH NOTHING BUT SUCH SORROW AS THIS CAN PRODUCE MISSUS CLAVERING WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT SHE HAD DRESSED HERSELF CAREFULLY SINCE THE MORNING AS WAS HER CUSTOM TO DO DAILY EVEN WHEN ALONE
6707-73028-0013 AND THAT SHE WAS NOT IN HER BEDROOM BUT IN A SMALL SITTING ROOM WHICH SHE GENERALLY USED WHEN SIR HUGH WAS NOT AT THE PARK
6707-73028-0014 YES I AM POOR POOR ENOUGH WHY HAVE THEY TROUBLED YOU TO COME ACROSS AGAIN DID YOU NOT SEND FOR ME BUT IT WAS QUITE RIGHT WHETHER YOU SENT OR NO OF COURSE I SHOULD COME WHEN I HEARD IT
6707-73028-0015 IT CANNOT BE GOOD FOR YOU TO BE ALL ALONE I SUPPOSE HE WILL BE HERE TO NIGHT YES IF HE GOT YOUR MESSAGE BEFORE THREE O'CLOCK OH HE WILL HAVE RECEIVED IT AND I SUPPOSE HE WILL COME
6707-73028-0016 YOU THINK HE WILL COME EH OF COURSE HE WILL COME I DO NOT KNOW HE DOES NOT LIKE COMING TO THE COUNTRY HE WILL BE SURE TO COME NOW HERMIONE AND WHO WILL TELL HIM SOME ONE MUST TELL HIM BEFORE HE COMES TO ME
6707-73028-0017 SHOULD THERE NOT BE SOME ONE TO TELL HIM THEY HAVE SENT ANOTHER MESSAGE HANNAH SHALL BE AT HAND TO TELL HIM HANNAH WAS THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER WHO HAD BEEN IN THE FAMILY WHEN SIR HUGH WAS BORN
6707-73028-0018 OR IF YOU WISH IT HENRY SHALL COME DOWN AND REMAIN HERE I AM SURE HE WILL DO SO IF IT WILL BE A COMFORT NO HE WOULD PERHAPS BE ROUGH TO MISTER CLAVERING HE IS SO VERY HARD HANNAH SHALL DO IT
6707-73028-0019 WILL YOU MAKE HER UNDERSTAND MISSUS CLAVERING PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD DO THIS WONDERING AS SHE DID SO AT THE WRETCHED FRIGID IMMOBILITY OF THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN BEFORE HER SHE KNEW LADY CLAVERING WELL
6707-73028-0020 KNEW HER TO BE IN MANY THINGS WEAK TO BE WORLDLY LISTLESS AND PERHAPS SOMEWHAT SELFISH BUT SHE KNEW ALSO THAT SHE HAD LOVED HER CHILD AS MOTHERS ALWAYS LOVE
6707-73028-0021 MISSUS CLAVERING HAD SAT DOWN BY HER AND TAKEN HER HAND AND WAS STILL SO SITTING IN SILENCE WHEN LADY CLAVERING SPOKE AGAIN I SUPPOSE HE WILL TURN ME OUT OF HIS HOUSE NOW SHE SAID
6707-73028-0022 WHO WILL DO SO HUGH OH
6707-73028-0023 MY DARLING HOW COULD I HELP IT AND HE SCOLDED ME BECAUSE THERE WAS NONE OTHER BUT HE HE WILL TURN ME OUT ALTOGETHER NOW OH MISSUS CLAVERING YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW HARD HE IS
6707-73028-0024 ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN THIS AND THEREFORE MISSUS CLAVERING ASKED THE POOR WOMAN TO TAKE HER INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE LITTLE BODY LAY IN ITS LITTLE COT IF SHE COULD INDUCE THE MOTHER TO WEEP FOR THE CHILD
6707-73028-0025 EVEN THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS HARD PERSISTENT FEAR AS TO WHAT HER HUSBAND WOULD SAY AND DO
6707-73028-0026 WHOSE SHORT SUFFERINGS HAD THUS BEEN BROUGHT TO AN END MY POOR DEAR WHAT CAN I SAY TO COMFORT YOU MISSUS CLAVERING AS SHE ASKED THIS KNEW WELL THAT NO COMFORT COULD BE SPOKEN IN WORDS BUT IF SHE COULD ONLY MAKE THE SUFFERER WEEP
6707-73028-0027 COMFORT SAID THE MOTHER THERE IS NO COMFORT NOW I BELIEVE IN ANYTHING IT IS LONG SINCE I KNEW ANY COMFORT NOT SINCE JULIA WENT HAVE YOU WRITTEN TO JULIA
6707-73028-0028 NO I HAVE WRITTEN TO NO ONE I CANNOT WRITE I FEEL AS THOUGH IF IT WERE TO BRING HIM BACK AGAIN I COULD NOT WRITE OF IT MY BOY MY BOY MY BOY BUT STILL
6707-73028-0029 THERE WAS NOT A TEAR IN HER EYE I WILL WRITE TO JULIA SAID MISSUS CLAVERING AND I WILL READ TO YOU MY LETTER NO DO NOT READ IT ME WHAT IS THE USE HE HAS MADE HER QUARREL WITH ME
6707-73028-0030 JULIA CARES NOTHING NOW FOR ME OR FOR MY ANGEL WHY SHOULD SHE CARE WHEN SHE CAME HOME WE WOULD NOT SEE HER OF COURSE SHE WILL NOT CARE WHO IS THERE THAT WILL CARE FOR ME
6707-73028-0031 YES BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE
6707-73028-0032 IF THEY WERE RIGHTLY PERFORMED WOULD IN THEIR PERFORMANCE SOFTEN THE MISERY OF HER LOT LADY CLAVERING LISTENED WITH THAT DULL USELESS ATTENTION
6707-73028-0033 WHICH ON SUCH OCCASIONS SORROW ALWAYS GIVES TO THE PRUDENT COUNSELS OF FRIENDSHIP
6707-73028-0034 AND WATCHING THE MOMENT OF HIS EXPECTED RETURN IN HER HEART SHE WISHED THAT HE MIGHT NOT COME ON THAT EVENING AT LAST AT HALF PAST NINE SHE EXERTED HERSELF TO SEND AWAY HER VISITOR
6707-73028-0035 HE WILL BE HERE SOON IF HE COMES TO NIGHT LADY CLAVERING SAID AND IT WILL BE BETTER THAT HE SHOULD FIND ME ALONE WILL IT BE BETTER
6707-73028-0036 YES YES CANNOT YOU SEE HOW HE WOULD FROWN AND SHAKE HIS HEAD IF YOU WERE HERE I WOULD SOONER BE ALONE WHEN HE COMES GOOD NIGHT
6707-73028-0037 BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS KIND THINGS ARE DONE KINDLY ALWAYS AT YOUR HOUSE BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH LOVE THERE YOU WILL WRITE TO JULIA FOR ME GOOD NIGHT THEN MISSUS CLAVERING KISSED HER AND WENT
6707-73028-0038 THINKING AS SHE WALKED HOME IN THE DARK TO THE RECTORY HOW MUCH SHE HAD TO BE THANKFUL IN THAT THESE WORDS HAD BEEN TRUE WHICH HER POOR NEIGHBOR HAD SPOKEN
