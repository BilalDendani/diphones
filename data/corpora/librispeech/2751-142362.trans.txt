2751-142362-0000 DINNER TIME WHEN ADAM HEARD THAT HE WAS TO DINE UPSTAIRS WITH THE LARGE TENANTS HE FELT RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE IDEA OF BEING EXALTED IN THIS WAY ABOVE HIS MOTHER AND SETH WHO WERE TO DINE IN THE CLOISTERS BELOW
2751-142362-0001 BUT MISTER MILLS THE BUTLER ASSURED HIM THAT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE HAD GIVEN PARTICULAR ORDERS ABOUT IT AND WOULD BE VERY ANGRY IF ADAM WAS NOT THERE ADAM NODDED AND WENT UP TO SETH WHO WAS STANDING A FEW YARDS OFF SETH LAD HE SAID

2751-142362-0007 RATHER THAN FROM THEIR POCKET AND OF THESE BARTLE MASSEY WAS ONE HIS LAME WALK WAS RATHER SLOWER THAN USUAL ON THIS WARM DAY SO ADAM LINGERED BEHIND WHEN THE BELL RANG FOR DINNER THAT HE MIGHT WALK UP WITH HIS OLD FRIEND
2751-142362-0008 FOR HE WAS A LITTLE TOO SHY TO JOIN THE POYSER PARTY ON THIS PUBLIC OCCASION OPPORTUNITIES OF GETTING TO HETTY'S SIDE WOULD BE SURE TO TURN UP IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND ADAM CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THAT FOR HE DISLIKED ANY RISK OF BEING JOKED ABOUT HETTY
2751-142362-0009 THE BIG OUTSPOKEN FEARLESS MAN WAS VERY SHY AND DIFFIDENT AS TO HIS LOVE MAKING WELL MESTER MASSEY SAID ADAM AS BARTLE CAME UP I'M GOING TO DINE UPSTAIRS WITH YOU TO DAY THE CAPTAIN'S SENT ME ORDERS

2751-142362-0015 AND YOU'VE HAD GOOD TEACHING YOU'VE HAD GOOD TEACHING WHEN THEY GOT UPSTAIRS THE QUESTION WHICH ARTHUR HAD LEFT UNSETTLED AS TO WHO WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND WHO VICE
2751-142362-0016 WAS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION SO THAT ADAM'S ENTRANCE PASSED WITHOUT REMARK IT STANDS TO SENSE MISTER CASSON WAS SAYING AS OLD MISTER POYSER
2751-142362-0017 SHOULD SIT AT TOP O THE TABLE I WASN'T BUTLER FIFTEEN YEAR WITHOUT LEARNING THE RIGHTS AND THE WRONGS ABOUT DINNER NAY NAY SAID OLD MARTIN I'N GI'EN UP TO MY SON
2751-142362-0018 WELL SAID MISTER POYSER SUPPOSE WE SAY THE MAN WI THE FOULEST LAND SHALL SIT AT TOP THEN
2751-142362-0019 BEING A NEUTRAL IN THE DISPUTE HAD NO INTEREST BUT IN CONCILIATION THE SCHOOLMASTER OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT'S RIGHT WHO'S TO SIT AT TOP O THE TABLE MISTER MASSEY WHY THE BROADEST MAN SAID BARTLE AND THEN HE WON'T TAKE UP OTHER FOLKS ROOM
2751-142362-0020 AND THE NEXT BROADEST MUST SIT AT BOTTOM THIS HAPPY MODE OF SETTLING THE DISPUTE PRODUCED MUCH LAUGHTER A SMALLER JOKE WOULD HAVE SUFFICED FOR THAT MISTER CASSON HOWEVER DID NOT FEEL IT COMPATIBLE WITH HIS DIGNITY AND SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE TO JOIN IN THE LAUGH UNTIL IT TURNED OUT
2751-142362-0021 THAT HE WAS FIXED ON AS THE SECOND BROADEST MAN MARTIN POYSER THE YOUNGER AS THE BROADEST WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND MISTER CASSON AS NEXT BROADEST WAS TO BE VICE OWING TO THIS ARRANGEMENT ADAM BEING OF COURSE
2751-142362-0022 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE FELL UNDER THE IMMEDIATE OBSERVATION OF MISTER CASSON WHO TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THE QUESTION OF PRECEDENCE HAD NOT HITHERTO NOTICED HIS ENTRANCE MISTER CASSON WE HAVE SEEN CONSIDERED ADAM RATHER LIFTED UP AND PEPPERY LIKE
2751-142362-0023 HE THOUGHT THE GENTRY MADE MORE FUSS ABOUT THIS YOUNG CARPENTER THAN WAS NECESSARY THEY MADE NO FUSS ABOUT MISTER CASSON ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT BUTLER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
2751-142362-0024 YOU'VE NIVER DINED HERE BEFORE AS I REMEMBER NO MISTER CASSON SAID ADAM IN HIS STRONG VOICE THAT COULD BE HEARD ALONG THE TABLE I'VE NEVER DINED HERE BEFORE BUT I COME BY CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE'S WISH AND I HOPE IT'S NOT DISAGREEABLE TO ANYBODY HERE
2751-142362-0025 NAY NAY SAID SEVERAL VOICES AT ONCE WE'RE GLAD YE'RE COME WHO'S GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAIN IT AND YE'LL SING US OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY AFTER DINNER WONNA YE SAID MISTER CHOWNE THAT'S A SONG I'M UNCOMMON FOND ON
2751-142362-0026 PEEH SAID MISTER CRAIG IT'S NOT TO BE NAMED BY SIDE O THE SCOTCH TUNES I'VE NEVER CARED ABOUT SINGING MYSELF I'VE HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO A MAN THAT'S GOT THE NAMES AND THE NATUR O PLANTS IN'S HEAD ISNA LIKELY TO KEEP A HOLLOW PLACE T HOLD TUNES IN
2751-142362-0027 BUT A SECOND COUSIN O MINE A DROVIER WAS A RARE HAND AT REMEMBERING THE SCOTCH TUNES HE'D GOT NOTHING ELSE TO THINK ON THE SCOTCH TUNES SAID BARTLE MASSEY CONTEMPTUOUSLY I'VE HEARD ENOUGH O THE SCOTCH TUNES TO LAST ME WHILE I LIVE
2751-142362-0028 THEY'RE FIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO FRIGHTEN THE BIRDS WITH THAT'S TO SAY THE ENGLISH BIRDS FOR THE SCOTCH BIRDS MAY SING SCOTCH FOR WHAT I KNOW GIVE THE LADS A BAGPIPE INSTEAD OF A RATTLE AND I'LL ANSWER FOR IT THE CORN LL BE SAFE
2751-142362-0029 WHY THE SCOTCH TUNES ARE JUST LIKE A SCOLDING NAGGING WOMAN BARTLE WENT ON WITHOUT DEIGNING TO NOTICE MISTER CRAIG'S REMARK THEY GO ON WITH THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NEVER COME TO A REASONABLE END
2751-142362-0030 ANYBODY UD THINK THE SCOTCH TUNES HAD ALWAYS BEEN ASKING A QUESTION OF SOMEBODY AS DEAF AS OLD TAFT AND HAD NEVER GOT AN ANSWER YET
2751-142362-0031 ADAM MINDED THE LESS ABOUT SITTING BY MISTER CASSON BECAUSE THIS POSITION ENABLED HIM TO SEE HETTY WHO WAS NOT FAR OFF HIM AT THE NEXT TABLE HETTY HOWEVER HAD NOT EVEN NOTICED HIS PRESENCE YET
2751-142362-0032 FOR SHE WAS GIVING ANGRY ATTENTION TO TOTTY WHO INSISTED ON DRAWING UP HER FEET ON TO THE BENCH IN ANTIQUE FASHION AND THEREBY THREATENED TO MAKE DUSTY MARKS ON HETTY'S PINK AND WHITE FROCK NO SOONER WERE THE LITTLE FAT LEGS PUSHED DOWN THAN UP THEY CAME AGAIN
2751-142362-0033 FOR TOTTY'S EYES WERE TOO BUSY IN STARING AT THE LARGE DISHES TO SEE WHERE THE PLUM PUDDING WAS FOR HER TO RETAIN ANY CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER LEGS HETTY GOT QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE AND AT LAST WITH A FROWN AND POUT AND GATHERING TEARS SHE SAID
2751-142362-0034 OH DEAR AUNT I WISH YOU'D SPEAK TO TOTTY SHE KEEPS PUTTING HER LEGS UP SO AND MESSING MY FROCK WHAT'S THE MATTER WI THE CHILD SHE CAN NIVER PLEASE YOU SAID THE MOTHER
2751-142362-0035 ADAM WAS LOOKING AT HETTY AND SAW THE FROWN AND POUT AND THE DARK EYES SEEMING TO GROW LARGER WITH PETTISH HALF GATHERED TEARS QUIET MARY BURGE WHO SAT NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THAT HETTY WAS CROSS AND THAT ADAM'S EYES WERE FIXED ON HER
2751-142362-0036 THOUGHT THAT SO SENSIBLE A MAN AS ADAM MUST BE REFLECTING ON THE SMALL VALUE OF BEAUTY IN A WOMAN WHOSE TEMPER WAS BAD MARY WAS A GOOD GIRL NOT GIVEN TO INDULGE IN EVIL FEELINGS BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT SINCE HETTY HAD A BAD TEMPER IT WAS BETTER ADAM SHOULD KNOW IT
2751-142362-0037 AND IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT IF HETTY HAD BEEN PLAIN SHE WOULD HAVE LOOKED VERY UGLY AND UNAMIABLE AT THAT MOMENT AND NO ONE'S MORAL JUDGMENT UPON HER WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LEAST BEGUILED BUT REALLY THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE CHARMING IN HER PETTISHNESS
2751-142362-0038 IT LOOKED SO MUCH MORE LIKE INNOCENT DISTRESS THAN ILL HUMOUR AND THE SEVERE ADAM FELT NO MOVEMENT OF DISAPPROBATION HE ONLY FELT A SORT OF AMUSED PITY AS IF HE HAD SEEN A KITTEN SETTING UP ITS BACK OR A LITTLE BIRD WITH ITS FEATHERS RUFFLED
2751-142362-0039 HE COULD NOT GATHER WHAT WAS VEXING HER BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM TO FEEL OTHERWISE THAN THAT SHE WAS THE PRETTIEST THING IN THE WORLD AND THAT IF HE COULD HAVE HIS WAY NOTHING SHOULD EVER VEX HER ANY MORE
2751-142362-0040 AND PRESENTLY WHEN TOTTY WAS GONE SHE CAUGHT HIS EYE AND HER FACE BROKE INTO ONE OF ITS BRIGHTEST SMILES AS SHE NODDED TO HIM
