6088-34570-0072 URSUS ADMIRED HOMO ONE ADMIRES ONE'S LIKE IT IS A LAW TO BE ALWAYS RAGING INWARDLY AND GRUMBLING OUTWARDLY WAS THE NORMAL CONDITION OF URSUS
6088-34570-0073 HE TOOK THE WORLD UNKINDLY HE GAVE HIS SATISFECIT TO NO ONE AND TO NOTHING THE BEE DID NOT ATONE BY ITS HONEY MAKING FOR ITS STING
6088-34570-0074 A FULL BLOWN ROSE DID NOT ABSOLVE THE SUN FOR YELLOW FEVER AND BLACK VOMIT IT IS PROBABLE THAT IN SECRET URSUS CRITICIZED PROVIDENCE A GOOD DEAL EVIDENTLY
6088-34570-0075 HE WOULD SAY THE DEVIL WORKS BY A SPRING AND THE WRONG THAT GOD DOES IS HAVING LET GO THE TRIGGER HE APPROVED OF NONE BUT PRINCES AND HE HAD HIS OWN PECULIAR WAY OF EXPRESSING HIS APPROBATION

6088-34570-0088 HIS GREAT BUSINESS WAS TO HATE THE HUMAN RACE HE WAS IMPLACABLE IN THAT HATE HAVING MADE IT CLEAR THAT HUMAN LIFE IS A DREADFUL THING HAVING OBSERVED THE SUPERPOSITION OF EVILS
6088-34570-0089 KINGS ON THE PEOPLE WAR ON KINGS THE PLAGUE ON WAR FAMINE ON THE PLAGUE FOLLY ON EVERYTHING HAVING PROVED A CERTAIN MEASURE OF CHASTISEMENT IN THE MERE FACT OF EXISTENCE
