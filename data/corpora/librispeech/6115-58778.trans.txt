6115-58778-0000 DRAINAGE BEFORE THE ICE AGE WE HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT DURING THE ICE AGE RIVER BEDS WERE CHANGED VALLEYS WERE FILLED UP NEW LAKES WERE MADE AND WATERFALLS CREATED GREAT AS WERE THE CHANGES MADE BY THE CARRYING POWER OF MOVING ICE
6115-58778-0001 STILL GREATER WERE THOSE MADE IN PREGLACIAL TIMES NOT HOWEVER FROM THE ACTION OF MOVING ICE BUT FROM RUNNING WATER EROSION CAUSED BY RUNNING WATER HAS PROBABLY
6115-58778-0002 THE VALLEY OF THE OHIO RIVER WILL PROBABLY AVERAGE A MILE IN WIDTH AT ITS UPPER LEVEL AND DEEP AS IT IS TO DAY IT WAS MUCH DEEPER IN PREGLACIAL TIMES THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE WHOLE BED OF THE RIVER
6115-58778-0003 WAS FROM ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FEET DEEPER THAN IT IS AT PRESENT THIS HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY BORINGS AT DIFFERENT POINTS TO ASCERTAIN THE DEPTH OF THE DRIFT THAT WAS LODGED DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD IN THE TROUGH OF THE OHIO RIVER
6115-58778-0004 ANYONE TRAVELING UP OR DOWN THE RIVER TO DAY CAN READILY SEE THAT IT IS A GREAT SINUOUS GROOVE CUT DOWN THROUGH THE EARTH BY MILLIONS OF YEARS OF WATER EROSION AND NOT ONLY THIS BUT THAT AT SOME TIME IN ITS HISTORY THIS GREAT VALLEY HAS BEEN PARTLY FILLED
6115-58778-0005 FORMING ON ONE OR BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER LEVEL AREAS CALLED BOTTOM LAND THESE LANDS ARE EXCEEDINGLY PRODUCTIVE OWING TO THE GREAT DEPTH AND RICHNESS OF THE SOIL FOR MANY YEARS THE WRITER LIVED UPON ONE OF THE RIVERS TRIBUTARY TO THE OHIO
6115-58778-0006 AND OFTEN MADE TRIPS BY STEAMBOAT UP AND DOWN THE OHIO RIVER TRAVELING ALONG THIS RIVER A CLOSE OBSERVER WILL BE STRUCK BY THE EXACTNESS OF THE STRATIFICATIONS IN THE ROCK AND IN THE COAL BEDS TO BE SEEN ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIVER
6115-58778-0007 ALL THE RIVERS THAT ARE TRIBUTARY TO THE OHIO SUCH AS THE MONONGAHELA THE ALLEGHANY THE MUSKINGUM THE TENNESSEE THE CUMBERLAND THE KENTUCKY THE WABASH THE MIAMI THE LICKING THE SCIOTO
6115-58778-0008 THE BIG SANDY THE KANAWHA THE HOCKING AND THE GREAT BEAVER BESIDES NUMEROUS SMALLER STREAMS HAVE THEIR OWN VALLEYS THAT HAVE BEEN WORN AWAY BY THE SAME PROCESS AND TO A GREATER DEPTH THAN THEY NOW APPEAR TO BE
6115-58778-0009 ALL OF THE MATERIAL THAT ONCE FILLED THESE VALLEYS HAS BEEN CARRIED DOWN BY THE WATER FILLING UP THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN AND BUILDING OUT THE GREAT DELTA OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI MOUNTAINS HAVE BEEN WORN DOWN AND CARRIED AWAY BY THE ACTION OF THE RUNNING WATER
6115-58778-0010 UNTIL THEIR HEIGHT IS MUCH LOWER THAN IN FORMER TIMES THE GREAT LAKES THAT WERE ENLARGED DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD AND IN SOME CASES WHOLLY CREATED BY THE SCOOPING OUT AND DAMMING UP OF THE WATERWAYS AND BY PILING GLACIAL DRIFT AROUND THEIR SHORES
6115-58778-0011 HAVE HAD SOME OF THEIR OUTLETS RAISED TO A HIGHER LEVEL AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN CREATED ANEW THE OLD RIVER BEDS THAT FORMERLY CARRIED THE WATER THAT IS NOW DRAINED THROUGH THE SAINT LAWRENCE WERE ERODED BY THE ACTION OF RUNNING WATER TO A GREAT DEPTH
6115-58778-0012 AND THE SALT WATER IS FOUND IN THE BED OF THE OLD RIVER GREAT BODIES OF SALT ARE FOUND AT THAT LOW LEVEL CONSTANTLY DISSOLVED BY THE WATER PERCOLATING THROUGH THE SAND AND GRAVEL OF THE GLACIAL DRIFT THIS SALT WATER IS PUMPED UP AND EVAPORATED
6115-58778-0013 LEAVING THE SALT FORMING ONE OF THE IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES OF THAT REGION ALL OF THE RIVERS FROM THE OHIO EASTWARD TELL THE SAME STORY WHICH IS THAT AT SOME REMOTE PERIOD THE LAND WAS MUCH HIGHER ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA THAN IT IS TO DAY
6115-58778-0014 THE BOTTOMS OF MANY OF THESE OLD RIVER BEDS ARE LOWER THAN SEA LEVEL BUT AS THEY WERE MADE BY RUNNING WATER THEY MUST HAVE BEEN AT ONE TIME ABOVE THAT POINT THERE IS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE THAT THE EARTH SINKS IN SOME PLACES AND RISES IN OTHERS
6115-58778-0015 ALONG THE RIDGES OF SOME OF THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS ARE FOUND IN GREAT ABUNDANCE THE PRODUCTS OF THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN THESE EVIDENCES SHOW THAT AT SOME PERIOD WHEN THE MOUNTAINS WERE FORMED
6115-58778-0016 EVIDENCES OF THIS EXIST IN VARIOUS PARTS NOT ONLY OF THE UNITED STATES BUT OF THE WORLD
6115-58778-0017 WHAT IS THE FINAL DESTINY OF THE EARTH THAT NOW APPEARS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN EVIDENTLY IF THE EARTH SHOULD REMAIN WITHOUT FURTHER UPHEAVAL
6115-58778-0018 THE PROBLEM OF BUILDING A WORLD AND THEN TEARING IT TO PIECES IS A VERY COMPLICATED ONE THERE IS A CONSTANT BATTLE GOING ON BETWEEN THE POWERS THAT BUILD UP AND THOSE THAT TEAR DOWN AND THIS IS AS TRUE OF CHARACTER BUILDING AS IT IS OF WORLD BUILDING
6115-58778-0019 THE WORLD HAS NEVER BEEN EXACTLY ALIKE ANY TWO SUCCESSIVE DAYS FROM THE TIME ITS FOUNDATIONS WERE LAID TO THE PRESENT MOMENT IT SEEMS TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF ALL LIFE AND GROWTH AS WELL AS OF ALL DECAY
6115-58778-0020 THAT THERE SHALL BE A CONSTANT CHANGE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS REST IN NATURE THE SMALLEST MOLECULES AND ATOMS OF MATTER ARE IN CONSTANT AGITATION IN THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE WORLD THERE IS A PERIOD OF LIFE AND GROWTH
6115-58778-0021 AND THIS SEEMS TO BE THE DESTINY OF PLANETS THEMSELVES
6115-58778-0022 STILL SCIENCE TEACHES US THAT WITH ALL THIS TURMOIL AND CHANGE NOTHING EITHER OF MATTER OR ENERGY IS LOST BUT THAT IT IS SIMPLY UNDERGOING ONE ETERNAL ROUND OF CHANGE DOES THIS LAW APPLY TO MIND AND SOUL
