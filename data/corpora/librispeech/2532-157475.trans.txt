2532-157475-0000 ALL DAY SATURDAY THE MEN HAD WORKED OUT UPON THE EAVES OF THE HOUSE AND THE DOLLS FACING THE WINDOW COULD SEE THEM THE MEN MADE QUITE A LOT OF NOISE WITH THEIR HAMMERS FOR THEY WERE PUTTING NEW GUTTERS AROUND THE EAVES AND POUNDING UPON TIN MAKES A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE
2532-157475-0001 MARCELLA HAD NOT PLAYED WITH THE DOLLS ALL THAT DAY FOR SHE HAD GONE VISITING SO WHEN THE MEN HAMMERED AND MADE A LOT OF NOISE
2532-157475-0002 WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW RAGGEDY ANDY ASKED HE WAS LYING WITH HIS HEAD BENEATH A LITTLE BED QUILT JUST AS MARCELLA HAD DROPPED HIM WHEN SHE LEFT THE NURSERY
2532-157475-0003 ANSWERED UNCLE CLEM BUT THEY ARE PUTTING NEW SHINGLES OR SOMETHING ON THE ROOF AFTER THE MEN HAD LEFT THEIR WORK AND GONE HOME TO SUPPER AND THE HOUSE WAS QUIET RAGGEDY ANDY CAUTIOUSLY MOVED HIS HEAD OUT FROM UNDER THE LITTLE BED QUILT AND
2532-157475-0004 AND RAGGEDY ANDY TOOK HER IN HIS RAG HAND AND GAVE HER A GREAT SWING WHICH SENT HER SCOOTING DOWN THE SHINY TIN GUTTER KERSWISH THEN RAGGEDY ANDY CLIMBED INTO THE GUTTER HIMSELF AND TAKING A FEW STEPS
2532-157475-0005 SPREAD OUT HIS FEET AND WENT SCOOTING DOWN THE SHINY TIN THE OTHER DOLLS FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND SCOOTED ALONG BEHIND HIM WHEN RAGGEDY ANDY CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE HE EXPECTED TO FIND THE PENNY DOLLS LYING THEY WERE NOWHERE ABOUT
2532-157475-0006 HE EXCLAIMED WHEN HE HAD PEEPED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE ROOF THE GUTTER
2532-157475-0007 AND THERE IS NOTHING BUT A HOLE THEY MUST HAVE SCOOTED RIGHT INTO THE HOLE HENNY THE DUTCH DOLL SAID RAGGEDY ANDY LAY FLAT UPON THE SHINY TIN AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE HOLE ARE YOU DOWN THERE PENNY DOLLS HE CALLED THERE WAS NO ANSWER
2532-157475-0008 RAGGEDY ANDY CRIED AS HE BRUSHED HIS HAND OVER HIS SHOE BUTTON EYES MAYBE IF YOU HOLD TO MY FEET
2532-157475-0009 AGAIN HE ADDED UNCLE CLEM AND HENNY EACH CAUGHT HOLD OF A FOOT OF RAGGEDY ANDY AND LET HIM SLIDE DOWN INTO THE HOLE IT WAS A RATHER TIGHT FIT BUT RAGGEDY ANDY WIGGLED AND TWISTED
2532-157475-0010 NOW HENNY AND UNCLE CLEM THOUGHT THAT RAGGEDY ANDY MEANT FOR THEM TO LET GO OF HIS FEET
2532-157475-0011 I CAN'T FIND THEM HE CRIED THEY HAVE GONE FARTHER DOWN THE PIPE NOW YOU CAN PULL ME UP WE CAN'T REACH YOU RAGGEDY ANDY UNCLE CLEM CALLED DOWN THE PIPE
2532-157475-0012 RAGGEDY ANDY TRIED TO WIGGLE BACKWARD UP THE PIPE BUT HIS CLOTHES CAUGHT UPON A LITTLE PIECE OF TIN WHICH STUCK OUT FROM THE INSIDE OF THE PIPE AND THERE HE STAYED HE COULD NEITHER GO DOWN NOR COME BACK UP WHAT SHALL WE DO UNCLE CLEM CRIED
2532-157475-0013 THE FOLKS WILL NEVER FIND HIM DOWN THERE FOR WE CAN NOT TELL THEM WHERE HE IS AND THEY WILL NEVER GUESS IT THE DOLLS WERE ALL VERY SAD THEY STAYED OUT UPON THE SHINY NEW TIN GUTTER UNTIL IT BEGAN RAINING AND HOPED AND HOPED THAT RAGGEDY ANDY COULD GET BACK UP TO THEM
2532-157475-0014 THEN THEY WENT INSIDE THE NURSERY AND SAT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW UNTIL IT WAS TIME FOR THE FOLKS TO GET UP AND THE HOUSE TO BE ASTIR THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE POSITION EACH HAD BEEN IN WHEN MARCELLA HAD LEFT THEM AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE VERY QUIET
2532-157475-0015 SIGHED RAGGEDY ANN FOR ALL THE WATER FROM THE HOUSE RUNS DOWN THE SHINY TIN GUTTERS AND DOWN THE PIPE INTO A RAIN BARREL AT THE BOTTOM THEN RAGGEDY ANN REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS AN OPENING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE TOMORROW NIGHT IF WE HAVE A CHANCE
2532-157475-0016 WE DOLLS MUST TAKE A STICK AND SEE IF WE CAN REACH RAGGEDY ANDY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE
2532-157475-0017 MARCELLA CAME UP TO THE NURSERY AND PLAYED ALL DAY WATCHING THE RAIN PATTER UPON THE NEW TIN GUTTER SHE WONDERED WHERE RAGGEDY ANDY WAS ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT GET WORRIED ABOUT HIM UNTIL SHE HAD ASKED MAMA WHERE HE MIGHT BE HE MUST BE JUST WHERE YOU LEFT HIM MAMA SAID
2532-157475-0018 I THOUGHT HE WAS WITH ALL THE OTHER DOLLS IN THE NURSERY THOUGH ALL DAY SUNDAY IT RAINED AND ALL OF SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING WHEN DADDY STARTED TO WORK IT WAS STILL RAINING AS DADDY WALKED OUT OF THE FRONT GATE
2532-157475-0019 AND ALL JAMMED TOGETHER BUT WHEN THE MAN STRAIGHTENED OUT THE FUNNY LITTLE FIGURE RAGGEDY ANDY LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH HIS CUSTOMARY HAPPY SMILE THE MAN LAUGHED AND CARRIED LITTLE WATER SOAKED RAGGEDY ANDY INTO THE HOUSE
2532-157475-0020 I GUESS YOUR LITTLE GIRL MUST HAVE DROPPED THIS RAG DOLL DOWN INTO THE DRAIN PIPE THE MAN SAID TO MAMA I'M SO GLAD YOU FOUND HIM MAMA SAID TO THE MAN WE HAVE HUNTED ALL OVER THE HOUSE FOR HIM MARCELLA COULD NOT REMEMBER WHERE SHE PUT HIM
2532-157475-0021 AND THERE HE SAT ALL AFTERNOON STEAMING AND DRYING OUT AND AS HE SAT THERE HE SMILED AND SMILED EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEE HIM HE FELT VERY HAPPY WITHIN
2532-157475-0022 AND HE LIKED TO SMILE ANYWAY BECAUSE HIS SMILE WAS PAINTED ON AND ANOTHER REASON RAGGEDY ANDY SMILED WAS BECAUSE HE WAS NOT LONESOME INSIDE HIS WAIST WERE THE TWO LITTLE PENNY DOLLS
