5038-31917-0000 WHENEVER I ATTEMPTED TO PERSUADE HER TO SPEAK FRANKLY SHE ASSURED ME THAT THE LETTER WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF HER MELANCHOLY AND BEGGED ME TO SAY NOTHING MORE ABOUT IT THEN I TRIED IN VAIN TO GUESS
5038-31917-0001 WHAT WAS PASSING IN HER HEART WE WENT TO THE THEATER EVERY NIGHT IN ORDER TO AVOID EMBARRASSING
5038-31917-0002 THERE WE SOMETIMES PRESSED EACH OTHER'S HANDS AT SOME FINE BIT OF ACTING OR BEAUTIFUL STRAIN OF MUSIC OR EXCHANGED PERHAPS A FRIENDLY GLANCE
5038-31917-0003 SMITH CAME ALMOST EVERY DAY ALTHOUGH HIS PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF ALL MY SORROW
5038-31917-0004 STILL HIS APPARENT GOOD FAITH AND HIS SIMPLICITY REASSURED ME I HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OF THE LETTERS HE HAD BROUGHT AND HE DID NOT APPEAR OFFENDED BUT SADDENED HE WAS IGNORANT OF THE CONTENTS AND HIS FRIENDSHIP
5038-31917-0005 FOR BRIGITTE LED HIM TO CENSURE THEM SEVERELY HE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO CARRY THEM HE SAID IF HE KNEW WHAT THEY CONTAINED
5038-31917-0006 HE WAS ASKED TO ACT AS INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN BRIGITTE AND HER RELATIVES AFTER OUR DEPARTURE
5038-31917-0007 HE NOTICED A CERTAIN COLDNESS AND RESTRAINT WHICH HE ENDEAVORED TO BANISH BY CHEERFUL GOOD HUMOR
5038-31917-0008 I KNOW NOT WHAT MELANCHOLY SYMPATHY I THOUGHT I DISCOVERED BETWEEN THEM TROUBLED AND DISQUIETED ME NOT OVER A MONTH AGO I WOULD HAVE BECOME VIOLENTLY JEALOUS BUT NOW OF WHAT COULD I SUSPECT BRIGITTE
5038-31917-0009 THAT HE SHOULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF ADDING TO HER SORROW
5038-31917-0010 THAT THE SIGHT OF THIS YOUNG MAN SHOULD AWAKEN MEMORIES AND REGRETS COULD HE ON THE OTHER HAND SEE HER START OFF ON A LONG JOURNEY
5038-31917-0011 I FELT THAT THIS MUST BE THE EXPLANATION AND THAT IT WAS MY DUTY TO ASSURE THEM THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF PROTECTING THE ONE FROM ALL DANGERS
5038-31917-0012 WHEN SMITH LEFT US IN THE EVENING WE EITHER KEPT SILENCE OR TALKED OF HIM I DO NOT KNOW WHAT FATAL ATTRACTION LED ME TO ASK ABOUT HIM CONTINUALLY
5038-31917-0013 SHE HOWEVER TOLD ME JUST WHAT I HAVE TOLD THE READER HIS LIFE HAD NEVER BEEN OTHER THAN IT WAS AT THIS TIME POOR OBSCURE AND HONEST
5038-31917-0014 IF THAT YOUNG MAN HAD ARRIVED AT THE TIME OF OUR GREATEST HAPPINESS HAD HE BROUGHT AN INSIGNIFICANT LETTER TO BRIGITTE HAD HE PRESSED HER HAND WHILE ASSISTING HER INTO THE CARRIAGE WOULD I HAVE PAID THE LEAST ATTENTION TO IT
5038-31917-0015 HAD HE RECOGNIZED ME AT THE OPERA OR HAD HE NOT HAD HE SHED TEARS FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON WHAT WOULD IT MATTER SO LONG AS I WAS HAPPY BUT WHILE UNABLE TO DIVINE THE CAUSE OF BRIGITTE'S SORROW
5038-31917-0016 I SAW THAT MY PAST CONDUCT WHATEVER SHE MIGHT SAY OF IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HER PRESENT STATE IF I HAD BEEN WHAT I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS THAT WE HAD LIVED TOGETHER
5038-31917-0017 NOTHING IN THE WORLD I WAS PERSUADED COULD HAVE TROUBLED OUR LOVE SMITH WAS ONLY AN ORDINARY MAN BUT HE WAS GOOD AND DEVOTED HIS SIMPLE AND MODEST QUALITIES RESEMBLED THE LARGE PURE LINES
5038-31917-0018 AND HE INSPIRED CONFIDENCE IF NOT ADMIRATION
5038-31917-0019 WHY DO WE WAIT SHE ASKED HERE I AM RECOVERED AND EVERYTHING IS READY WHY DID WE WAIT INDEED I DO NOT KNOW SEATED NEAR THE FIRE MY EYES WANDERED FROM SMITH TO MY MISTRESS
5038-31917-0020 BUT AN INSTINCT PERSISTENT AND FATAL WHAT STRANGE CREATURES WE IT PLEASED ME TO LEAVE THEM ALONE BEFORE THE FIRE AND TO GO OUT
5038-31917-0021 LEANING ON THE PARAPET AND LOOKING AT THE WATER WHEN THEY SPOKE OF THEIR LIFE AT N AND WHEN BRIGITTE ALMOST CHEERFUL ASSUMED A MOTHERLY AIR
5038-31917-0022 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SUFFERED AND YET TOOK PLEASURE IN IT I ASKED QUESTIONS I SPOKE TO SMITH OF HIS MOTHER OF HIS PLANS AND HIS PROSPECTS I GAVE HIM
5038-31917-0023 AND FORCED HIS MODESTY TO REVEAL HIS MERIT YOU LOVE YOUR SISTER VERY MUCH DO YOU NOT I ASKED
5038-31917-0024 THAT HIS EXPENSES WERE RATHER HEAVY BUT THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE WITHIN TWO YEARS PERHAPS SOONER IF HIS HEALTH WOULD PERMIT HIM TO DO SOME EXTRA WORK WHICH WOULD BRING IN ENOUGH TO PROVIDE HER DOWRY
5038-31917-0025 THAT THERE WAS A FAMILY IN THE COUNTRY WHOSE ELDEST SON WAS HER FRIEND THAT THEY WERE ALMOST AGREED ON IT AND THAT FORTUNE WOULD ONE DAY COME LIKE REST WITHOUT THINKING OF IT THAT HE HAD SET ASIDE FOR HIS SISTER
5038-31917-0026 A PART OF THE MONEY LEFT BY THEIR FATHER
5038-31917-0027 OF A YOUNG GIRL IS FIXED ON THE DAY OF HER MARRIAGE THUS LITTLE BY LITTLE HE EXPRESSED WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART AND I WATCHED BRIGITTE LISTENING TO HIM THEN WHEN HE AROSE TO LEAVE US I ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DOOR AND STOOD THERE
5038-31917-0028 WERE SO DEAR TO US I STOPPED IN THE HALL EVERY NOTE REACHED
5038-31917-0029 NEVER HAD SHE SUNG SO SADLY SO DIVINELY SMITH WAS LISTENING WITH PLEASURE HE WAS ON HIS KNEES HOLDING THE BUCKLE OF THE STRAP IN HIS HANDS HE FASTENED IT THEN LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM AT THE OTHER GOODS HE HAD PACKED
5038-31917-0030 AND COVERED WITH A LINEN CLOTH SATISFIED WITH HIS WORK
5038-31917-0031 BRIGITTE HER HANDS ON THE KEYS
5038-31917-0032 SING MY DEAR I BEG OF YOU
5038-31917-0033 ON ANOTHER OCCASION I HAD BOUGHT AN ALBUM CONTAINING VIEWS OF SWITZERLAND WE WERE LOOKING AT THEM ALL THREE OF US AND WHEN BRIGITTE FOUND A SITE THAT PLEASED HER SHE WOULD STOP TO EXAMINE IT
5038-31917-0034 THERE WAS ONE VIEW THAT SEEMED TO PLEASE HER MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS IT WAS A CERTAIN SPOT
5038-31917-0035 IN THE DISTANCE A VILLAGE CONSISTING OF SOME DOZEN HOUSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE IN THE FOREGROUND A YOUNG GIRL WITH A LARGE STRAW HAT
5038-31917-0036 STANDING BEFORE HER APPARENTLY POINTING OUT WITH HIS IRON TIPPED STICK THE ROUTE OVER WHICH HE HAD COME HE WAS DIRECTING HER ATTENTION TO A WINDING PATH THAT LED TO THE MOUNTAIN ABOVE THEM WERE THE ALPS
5038-31917-0037 NOTHING COULD BE MORE SIMPLE
5038-31917-0038 I AM TRYING TO SEE IF I CAN NOT CHANGE THAT FACE SLIGHTLY AND MAKE IT RESEMBLE YOURS THE PRETTY HAT WOULD BECOME YOU AND CAN I NOT IF I AM SKILFUL GIVE THAT FINE MOUNTAINEER SOME RESEMBLANCE TO ME
5038-31917-0039 THE WHIM SEEMED TO PLEASE HER AND SHE SET ABOUT RUBBING OUT THE TWO FACES WHEN I HAD PAINTED HER PORTRAIT SHE WISHED TO TRY MINE THE FACES WERE VERY SMALL HENCE NOT VERY DIFFICULT
5038-31917-0040 IT WAS AGREED THAT THE LIKENESSES WERE STRIKING WHILE WE WERE LAUGHING AT IT THE DOOR OPENED AND I WAS CALLED AWAY BY THE SERVANT WHEN I RETURNED SMITH
5038-31917-0041 WAS LEANING ON THE TABLE AND LOOKING AT THE PICTURE WITH INTEREST HE WAS ABSORBED IN A PROFOUND REVERIE AND WAS NOT AWARE OF MY PRESENCE I SAT DOWN NEAR THE FIRE AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL
5038-31917-0042 I SPOKE TO BRIGITTE THAT HE RAISED HIS HEAD HE LOOKED AT US A MOMENT THEN HASTILY TOOK HIS LEAVE AND AS HE APPROACHED THE DOOR I SAW HIM STRIKE HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HAND WHEN I DISCOVERED THESE SIGNS OF GRIEF
5038-31917-0043 I SAID TO MYSELF WHAT DOES IT MEAN THEN I CLASPED MY HANDS TO PLEAD WITH WHOM
