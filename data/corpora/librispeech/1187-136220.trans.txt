1187-136220-0000 TO SEARCH FOR THE SECRET CITY OF THE INDIANS WE FOUND OURSELVES TOGETHER WITH MOLAS AT VERA CRUZ WAITING FOR A SHIP TO TAKE US TO FRONTERA WHERE WE PROPOSED TO DISEMBARK THIS PORT WE HAD CHOSEN IN PREFERENCE TO
1187-136220-0001 ALTHOUGH THE LATTER WAS NEARER TO THE RUINS WHERE WE HOPED TO FIND THE INDIAN ZIBALBAY BECAUSE FROM IT WE COULD TRAVEL IN CANOES
1187-136220-0002 AND OTHER RIVERS UNOBSERVED BY ANY SAVE THE NATIVES THINGS ARE CHANGED NOW IN THESE PARTS BUT IN THOSE DAYS THE WHITE MEN WHO LIVED THEREABOUTS BEYOND THE CIRCLE OF THE TOWNS
1187-136220-0003 WERE TOO OFTEN ROBBERS AS MOLAS HAD FOUND TO HIS COST SOME FEW WEEKS BEFORE AT VERA CRUZ WE PURCHASED SUCH ARTICLES AS WERE NECESSARY TO OUR JOURNEY
1187-136220-0004 NOT MANY FOR WE COULD NOT BE SURE OF FINDING MEANS TO CARRY THEM AMONG THEM WERE HAMMOCKS THREE GUNS THAT WOULD SHOOT EITHER BALL OR SHOT WITH AMMUNITION AS MANY MUZZLE LOADING COLT'S REVOLVERS
1187-136220-0005 SOME MEDICINES BLANKETS BOOTS AND SPARE CLOTHES ALSO WE TOOK WITH US ALL THE MONEY THAT WE POSSESSED AMOUNTING TO SOMETHING OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN GOLD WHICH SUM WE DIVIDED BETWEEN US
1187-136220-0006 CARRYING IT IN BELTS ABOUT OUR MIDDLES AT VERA CRUZ WHERE PEOPLE ARE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF OTHERS
1187-136220-0007 ENGLISHMEN WHO LOVE TO VISIT OLD RUINS FOR WHICH PURPOSE HE WAS TRAVELLING TO YUCATAN THAT I IGNATIO WAS HIS GUIDE AND COMPANION AND THAT MOLAS MY FOSTER BROTHER WAS OUR SERVANT
1187-136220-0008 AS IT CHANCED THE DEPARTURE OF THIS SHIP WAS DELAYED FOR A WEEK SO BEING PRESSED FOR TIME AND FEARING LEST WE SHOULD CATCH THE YELLOW FEVER THAT WAS RAGING IN THE TOWN UNHAPPILY FOR OURSELVES WE TOOK PASSAGE
1187-136220-0009 IN A MEXICAN BOAT CALLED THE SANTA MARIA SHE WAS AN OLD SAILING VESSEL OF NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TONS BURDEN THAT HAD BEEN CONVERTED BY HER OWNERS INTO A PADDLE WHEEL STEAMER
1187-136220-0010 WITH THE RESULT THAT EXCEPT IN FAVOURABLE WEATHER SHE COULD NEITHER SAIL NOR STEAM WITH ANY SPEED OR SAFETY HER BUSINESS WAS TO TRADE WITH PASSENGERS AND CARGO BETWEEN VERA CRUZ AND THE PORTS OF FRONTERA AND
1187-136220-0011 WHERE FOR
1187-136220-0012 FRONTERA HE ANSWERED YOUR BOAT STOPS THERE DOES SHE NOT
1187-136220-0013 FIRST AND RETURN TO FRONTERA A WEEK LATER BUT OF THIS MORE IN ITS PLACE THAT AFTERNOON THE SANTA MARIA WITH US ON BOARD OF HER WAS PILOTED OUT OF THE HARBOUR OF VERA CRUZ
1187-136220-0014 AND WE HEARD THE PILOT SWEARING BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER PROPERLY TO HER HELM STANDING BY THE ENGINES WE NOTICED ALSO THAT
1187-136220-0015 IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO KEEP A STREAM OF WATER IN CONSTANT PLAY UPON THE BEARINGS THE SEOR ASKED THE REASON OF THIS OF THE MAN WHO WAS MATE AND ENGINEER OF THE BOAT AND HE ANSWERED WITH A SHRUG
1187-136220-0016 THE BEARINGS SHOULD IT PLEASE THE SAINTS WOULD LAST THIS VOYAGE UNLESS THEY HAD THE BAD LUCK TO RUN INTO A NORTHER AS YOU ENGLISH CALL
1187-136220-0017 CROSSED HIMSELF TO AVERT THE OMEN AND VANISHED DOWN THE STOKE HOLE NOW WE BEGAN TO FEEL SORRY THAT WE HAD NOT TAKEN PASSAGE IN THE AMERICAN SHIP SINCE OF LATE NORTHERS HAD BEEN FREQUENT
1187-136220-0018 WE AMUSED OURSELVES BY STUDYING OUR FELLOW PASSENGERS OF THESE THERE WERE SEVERAL ON BOARD PERHAPS TWENTY IN ALL MEXICAN LANDOWNERS AND OFFICIALS RETURNING TO THEIR HACIENDAS
1187-136220-0019 AND NATIVE TOWNS AFTER A VISIT TO VERA CRUZ OR THE CAPITAL SOME OF THEM PLEASANT COMPANIONS ENOUGH AND OTHERS NOT SO THREE OR FOUR OF THESE GENTLEMEN WERE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR WIVES BUT THE LADIES
1187-136220-0020 HAD ALREADY RETIRED TO THE BUNKS OPENING OUT OF THE CABIN WHERE ALTHOUGH THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH THEY COULD BE HEARD SUFFERING THE PAINS OF SICKNESS
1187-136220-0021 WHO PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE GORGEOUSNESS OF HIS DRESS IN APPEARANCE HE WAS LARGE HANDSOME AND COARSE AND HE HAD INDIAN BLOOD IN HIS VEINS
1187-136220-0022 YOU SEE YONDER MAN WITH THE SILVER BUTTONS ON HIS COAT HE IS
1187-136220-0023 WHO WAYLAID AND ROBBED ME OF THE NUGGETS WHICH THE OLD INDIAN GAVE ME FOR THE COST OF MY JOURNEY TO FIND YOU I HEARD AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS AWAY FROM THE HACIENDA IN VERA CRUZ OR MEXICO
1187-136220-0024 AND NOW DOUBTLESS HE RETURNS THITHER BEWARE OF HIM LORD AND BID THE ENGLISHMAN TO DO THE SAME FOR LIKE HIS FATHER HE IS A BAD MAN AND HE TOLD ME CERTAIN THINGS CONNECTED WITH HIM AND HIS FAMILY
1187-136220-0025 BUT I WAITED TILL HE HAD FINISHED BEFORE GOING DOWN AT THE DOOR OF THE CABIN I MET THE CAPTAIN A STOUT MAN WITH A FACE
1187-136220-0026 MY DINNER SEOR I ANSWERED

1187-136220-0029 INSULT WAS DEEP IT WAS ONE TO WHICH I WAS ACCUSTOMED FOR IN THIS LAND WHICH BELONGS TO THEM AND WHERE THEIR FATHERS RULED TO BE AN INDIAN IS TO BE AN OUTCAST THEREFORE NOT WISHING TO MAKE A STIR I BOWED AND TURNED AWAY
1187-136220-0030 MEANWHILE IT SEEMS THAT THE SEOR STRICKLAND MISSING ME IN THE CABIN ASKED THE CAPTAIN WHERE I WAS SAYING THAT PERHAPS I DID NOT KNOW THAT THE MEAL WAS READY IF YOU REFER
1187-136220-0031 I MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND SENT HIM AWAY SURELY THE SEOR KNOWS THAT WE DO NOT SIT AT TABLE WITH THESE PEOPLE
1187-136220-0032 IF MY FRIEND IS AN INDIAN HE IS AS GOOD A GENTLEMAN AS YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS CABIN MOREOVER
1187-136220-0033 AND HAS A RIGHT TO FIRST CLASS ACCOMMODATION I INSIST UPON A SEAT BEING PROVIDED FOR HIM AT MY SIDE AS YOU WISH ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SMILING FOR HE WAS A MAN OF PEACE ONLY IF HE COMES THERE WILL BE TROUBLE
1187-136220-0034 AND HE ORDERED THE STEWARD TO FETCH ME NOW THIS STEWARD WAS AN INDIAN WHO KNEW MY RANK THEREFORE NOT WISHING TO OFFEND ME BY REPEATING WHAT HAD PASSED HE SAID SIMPLY THAT THE CAPTAIN SENT HIS COMPLIMENTS
1187-136220-0035 AND BEGGED THAT I WOULD COME DOWN TO DINNER THE END OF IT WAS THAT I WENT THOUGH DOUBTFULLY AND SEEING ME IN THE DOORWAY THE SEOR STRICKLAND CALLED TO ME IN A LOUD VOICE SAYING YOU ARE LATE FOR DINNER FRIEND BUT I HAVE
1187-136220-0036 SIT DOWN QUICKLY OR THE FOOD WILL BE COLD I BOWED TO THE COMPANY AND OBEYED AND THEN THE TROUBLE COMMENCED FOR ALL PRESENT HAD HEARD THIS TALK AS I TOOK MY SEAT THE MEXICANS BEGAN TO MURMUR
1187-136220-0037 AND THE PASSENGER WHO WAS NEXT TO ME INSOLENTLY MOVED HIS PLATE AND GLASS AWAY
1187-136220-0038 IT IS NOT USUAL THAT INDIAN DOGS SHOULD SIT AT THE SAME TABLE WITH GENTLEMEN THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND ANSWERED MILDLY
1187-136220-0039 SEOR ON MY LEFT TO ME IT DOES NOT MATTER I AM ONLY A POOR SAILOR AND ACCUSTOMED TO EVERY SORT OF COMPANY

1187-136220-0042 AND DRAWING A LARGE PISTOL FROM HIS POCKET HE LAID IT BY HIS PLATE SEORS BOTH HE SAID IN A SOFT VOICE AND WITH A GENTLE SMILE I AM LOTH TO INTERFERE IN A QUARREL OF TWO ESTEEMED PASSENGERS
1187-136220-0043 BUT THOUGH I AM ONLY A POOR SAILOR IT IS MY DUTY TO SEE THAT THERE IS
1187-136220-0044 I HASTEN TO WITHDRAW MYSELF BUT BEFORE I GO I WISH TO SAY SOMETHING NOT BY WAY OF BOASTING BUT TO JUSTIFY MY FRIEND THE ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IN HIS ACTION ON MY BEHALF
1187-136220-0045 HOWEVER WELL BORN YOU MAY BE MY DESCENT IS NOBLER AND MORE ANCIENT THAN YOURS AND THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE NO SHAME TO YOU TO SIT AT TABLE WITH ME LEAST OF ALL SHOULD
1187-136220-0046 WHOSE FATHER IS A MURDERER
1187-136220-0047 AND WHOSE MOTHER WAS A HALF BRED MESTIZA SLUT DARE TO BE INSOLENT TO ME WHO AS ANY INDIAN ON BOARD THIS SHIP CAN TELL YOU AM A PRINCE AMONG MY OWN PEOPLE
1187-136220-0048 HIS SALLOW COMPLEXION TURNED TO A WHITISH GREEN AS HE LISTENED TO MY WORDS AND FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR OVERCOME WITH RAGE THEN HE SPRUNG UP ONCE MORE GRIPPING AT HIS KNIFE
1187-136220-0049 YOU DOG HE GASPED LET ME BUT COME AT YOU AND I'LL CUT YOUR LYING TONGUE OUT
1187-136220-0050 FIXING MY EYES UPON HIS FACE WHAT I HAVE SAID OF YOUR FATHER IS TRUE MORE THERE IS A MAN ON BOARD THIS SHIP WHOM NOT THREE MONTHS SINCE HE ROBBED WITH VIOLENCE IF THE GENTLEMEN YOUR COMPANIONS
1187-136220-0051 WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE STORY I CAN TELL IT TO THEM FOR THE REST I AM WELL ABLE TO DEFEND MYSELF MOREOVER THIS VESSEL IS MANNED BY INDIANS WHO KNOW ME

1187-136220-0055 HOUNDS AS THESE CAN YOU WONDER THAT I AM NOT FOND OF MEXICANS
1187-136220-0056 BUT ALL THE SAME I ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL OF THIS
1187-136220-0057 HE IS NOT A MAN TO KISS THE STICK THAT BEATS HIM AND HE WILL MAKE AN END OF YOU AND
1187-136220-0058 IF HE CAN DO NOT BE AFRAID SEOR I ANSWERED LAUGHING BESIDES THE STEWARD AND MOLAS THERE ARE TWENTY INDIANS ON BOARD
1187-136220-0059 TWO OF THESE MEN ARE ASSOCIATES OF THE HEART
1187-136220-0060 WITHOUT FINDING THEM READY FOR HIM ONLY WE SHALL DO WELL TO SLEEP ON DECK AND NOT BELOW
1187-136220-0061 ON THE FORECASTLE OF THE SANTA MARIA WITH MOLAS SLEEPING CLOSE BEHIND US
1187-136220-0062 TO BE AWAKENED BY THE SUDDEN STOPPAGE OF THE VESSEL THE DAY WAS ON THE POINT OF DAWN A BEAUTIFUL AND PEARLY LIGHT LAY UPON THE QUIET SURFACE OF THE SEA ABOVE US THE STARS STILL SHONE FAINTLY IN THE HEAVENS
1187-136220-0063 WE SAT UP WONDERING WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SAW THE CAPTAIN WRAPPED IN A DIRTY BLANKET ENGAGED IN EARNEST CONVERSATION WITH THE ENGINEER WHO WORE A STILL DIRTIER SHIRT AND NOTHING ELSE
1187-136220-0064 HEARING THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG THE SEOR JAMES WENT TO THE CAPTAIN AND ASKED HIM WHY WE HAD STOPPED BECAUSE THE ENGINES WON'T GO ANY MORE AND THERE IS NO WIND TO SAIL WITH HE ANSWERED POLITELY
1187-136220-0065 NOTHING NOTHING REPLIED THE CAPTAIN GLANCING ANXIOUSLY AT A NARROW BLACK BAND OF CLOUD THAT LAY ON THE RIM OF THE HORIZON BENEATH THE FLEECY MASSES IN WHICH THE LIGHTS OF DAWN WERE BURNING
1187-136220-0066 WHITE MAN'S WAY NO NO EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN CROSSING HIMSELF AT THE NAME OF THAT EVIL POWER EL NORTE
1187-136220-0067 HE HURRIED AWAY AS THOUGH TO AVOID FURTHER CONVERSATION PRESENTLY THE ENGINES BEGAN TO WORK AGAIN THOUGH HALTINGLY LIKE A LAME MULE AND AS THE MORNING DREW ON THE DAY BECAME CLEAR
1187-136220-0068 AND THE THIN BLACK CLOUD VANISHED FROM THE HORIZON TOWARDS THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON MOLAS POINTING TO A LOW COAST LINE AND A SPOT ON THE SEA WHERE THE OCEAN SWELL SHOWED TIPPED WITH WHITE TOLD US THAT YONDER WAS THE BAR OF THE
1187-136220-0069 AND THAT BEHIND IT LAY THE VILLAGE OF FRONTERA OUR DESTINATION
1187-136220-0070 THAT I WILL GET MY THINGS ON DECK AND GOING TO HIS CABIN HE BROUGHT UP A SACK CONTAINING SOME WRAPS AND FOOD WHY DO YOU FETCH YOUR BAGGAGE ASKED THE CAPTAIN PRESENTLY YOU MAY WANT IT TO NIGHT
1187-136220-0071 I DO NOT WISH TO LAND AT FRONTERA WITH NOTHING
1187-136220-0072 BY THE BLESSING OF THE SAINTS WE SHALL REACH TO MORROW EVENING
1187-136220-0073 THE AGENT GAVE THEM TO ME
1187-136220-0074 ALL BEING WELL WE SHALL CALL AT FRONTERA THIS DAY WEEK AND THEN YOU CAN GO ASHORE WITHOUT EXTRA CHARGE BUT BEFORE THIS MY ORDERS ARE TO PUT INTO NO PORT EXCEPT
1187-136220-0075 THAT IS UNLESS A NORTHER FORCES ME TO DO SO MAY THE NORTHER SINK YOU YOUR SHIP YOUR AGENTS
1187-136220-0076 ANSWERED THE SEOR IN SO ANGRY A VOICE THAT THE MEXICAN PASSENGERS WHO WERE LISTENING BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THE ENGLISHMAN'S DISCOMFITURE THOUGH THE MORE THOUGHTFUL OF THEM CROSSED THEMSELVES TO AVERT THE EVIL OMEN
1187-136220-0077 AS I HAVE SAID WAS NOT OF THE COOLEST RAGED AND SWORE IN NO MEASURED TERMS THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND APOLOGISED THE PASSENGERS SMILED AND SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR THE MATTER I LOOKED ON PATIENTLY AFTER THE MANNER OF MY RACE
1187-136220-0078 WHAT MANNER OF MEN ARE THESE ENGLISH
1187-136220-0079 HEAVEN WHY ARE THEY ALWAYS IN A HURRY
1187-136220-0080 ANY GOOD MOOD TO DESCEND TO THE CABIN AND MEET
1187-136220-0081 WE HAD SEEN NOTHING SINCE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AS WE WERE FINISHING OUR MEAL THE LIGHT FADED AND THE SKY GREW CURIOUSLY DARK WHILE SUDDENLY TO THE NORTH THERE APPEARED A RIM OF CLOUD
1187-136220-0082 SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH WE HAD SEEN UPON THE HORIZON AT DAWN
1187-136220-0083 FROM A SMELTING FURNACE AT NIGHT THE SKY LOOKS VERY STRANGE IGNATIO SAID THE SEOR TO ME AND AT THAT MOMENT WE HEARD MOLAS AND AN INDIAN SAILOR SPEAKING TOGETHER IN BRIEF WORDS
1187-136220-0084 POINTING TOWARDS THE RED RIM OF LIGHT SI EL NORTE ANSWERED THE SAILOR AS HE WENT TOWARDS THE CABIN PRESENTLY THE CAPTAIN HURRIED UP THE COMPANION LADDER AND STUDIED THE HORIZON
1187-136220-0085 IN ANOTHER MINUTE THE MATE JOINED HIM APPEARING FROM THE ENGINE HATCH AND THE TWO OF THEM BEGAN TO CONVERSE OR RATHER TO DISPUTE I WAS SITTING NEAR UNOBSERVED IN THE DARKNESS AND SO FAR AS I COULD GATHER
1187-136220-0086 THE MATE WAS IN FAVOUR OF PUTTING THE SHIP ABOUT AND RUNNING FOR FRONTERA FROM WHICH PORT WE WERE NOW DISTANT SOME FORTY MILES ON THE OTHER HAND THE CAPTAIN SAID THAT IF THEY DID SO AND THE NORTHER CAME UP
1187-136220-0087 AND IF BY ILL LUCK IT SHOULD COME THEIR BEST COURSE WAS TO STAND FOR THE OPEN SEA AND RIDE IT OUT THE MATE ANSWERED THAT THIS WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT PLAN IF THE SHIP WERE STAUNCH AND THE ENGINES TO BE RELIED ON
1187-136220-0088 THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO SAIL A BOAT WITH A MAST MADE OF CIGARETTES AS TO ATTEMPT TO LIE HEAD
1187-136220-0089 AND A STRAINED PADDLE WHEEL AFTER THIS THE DISCUSSION GREW FIERCE AND AS FULL OF OATHS AS A SHARK'S MOUTH WITH TEETH BUT IN THE END THE TWO SAILORS DETERMINED THAT THEIR SAFEST PLAN WOULD BE TO HOLD
1187-136220-0090 ON THEIR PRESENT COURSE AND IF NECESSARY ROUND POINT
1187-136220-0091 AND TAKE SHELTER BEHIND CARMEN ISLAND OR IF THEY COULD IN THE MOUTH OF THE
1187-136220-0092 THEN THEY PARTED THE CAPTAIN
1187-136220-0093 AND STILLER AND YET MORE STILL THE SEOR STRICKLAND WHO HAD BEEN WALKING UP AND DOWN THE DECK SMOKING A CIGAR CAME AND SAT BESIDE ME ON A COIL OF ROPE AND ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT THE NORTHER WAS COMING YES
1187-136220-0094 IT IS COMING I ANSWERED AND I FEAR THAT IT WILL SINK US AT LEAST SO SAY THE INDIAN SAILORS YOU TAKE THE IDEA OF BEING DROWNED LIKE A PUPPY IN A SACK VERY COOLLY IGNATIO HOW FAR ARE WE FROM POINT
1187-136220-0095 ABOUT TWELVE MILES I BELIEVE AND I TAKE IT COOLLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO USE IN MAKING AN OUTCRY GOD WILL PROTECT US IF HE CHOOSES AND IF HE CHOOSES HE WILL DROWN US
1187-136220-0096 IT IS CHILDISH TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DESTINY A TRUE INDIAN CREED IGNATIO HE ANSWERED YOU PEOPLE SIT DOWN AND SAY
1187-136220-0097 BUT ONE THAT I AND THE MEN OF MY NATION DO NOT BELIEVE IN IF THEY HAD DONE SO INSTEAD OF BEING THE FIRST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO DAY ENGLAND LONG AGO WOULD HAVE CEASED TO EXIST
1187-136220-0098 FOR MANY A TIME SHE HAS STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH FATE AND BEATEN HER FOR MY PART IF I MUST DIE I PREFER TO DIE FIGHTING TELL ME ARE ANY OF THESE PEOPLE TO BE RELIED ON IF IT COMES TO A PINCH
1187-136220-0099 ALSO THEY KNOW THE COAST AND IF NEED BE THEY WILL DO ANYTHING THAT I TELL THEM FOR THE REST I CANNOT SAY BUT THE CAPTAIN SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING OF HIS BUSINESS LOOK AND LISTEN
1187-136220-0100 PIERCED THE HEAVENS ABOVE US FOLLOWED BY A DEAFENING PEAL OF THUNDER IN ITS FIERCE AND SUDDEN GLARE WE COULD SEE THE COAST SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES AWAY AND ALMOST AHEAD OF US
1187-136220-0101 AND A SAIL THAT HAD BEEN HOISTED FLAPPED TO AND FRO FOR LACK OF WIND TO DRAW IT A MILE OR SO TO WINDWARD HOWEVER WAS A DIFFERENT SIGHT FOR THERE CAME THE NORTHER RUSHING UPON US LIKE A THING ALIVE
1187-136220-0102 IN FRONT OF IT A LINE OF WHITE BILLOWS TORN FROM THE QUIET SURFACE OF THE SEA AND BEHIND IT FRETTED BY LITTLE LIGHTNINGS
1187-136220-0103 IN THE STRANGE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED
1187-136220-0104 HE SHOUTED TO THE HELMSMAN TO BRING THE SHIP HEAD ON TO THE SEA AND TO THE SAILORS TO BATTEN DOWN THE AFTER HATCH THE ONLY ONE THAT REMAINED OPEN SHUTTING THE PASSENGERS EXCEPT OURSELVES AND MOLAS INTO THE CABIN
1187-136220-0105 HIS ORDERS WERE OBEYED WELL AND QUICKLY THE SANTA MARIA CAME ROUND AND BEGAN TO PADDLE TOWARDS THE OPEN WATER AND THE ADVANCING LINE OF FOAM IT WAS TERRIBLE TO SEE HER SO SMALL A THING
1187-136220-0106 CUT OUR FACES LIKE THE LASH OF A WHIP A FEW MORE SECONDS AND SOMETHING WHITE AND ENORMOUS COULD BE SEEN
1187-136220-0107 THE SIGHT OF IT CAUSED THE CAPTAIN WHOSE FACE LOOKED PALE AS DEATH IN THE GLEAM OF THE LIGHTNINGS TO SHRIEK ANOTHER ORDER TO HIS CREW LIE DOWN AND HOLD ON TIGHT TO THE ROPE
