7837-109173-0000 LIFE CLEAR RUNNING WATER FILLED THE DITCH BUT THE BOTTOM WAS DULL BLACK POWDERY MUD IT LAY INCHES DEEP LAYER UPON LAYER OF ONE TINY PARTICLE UPON ANOTHER
7837-109173-0001 AND SO LOOSE AND LIGHT THAT A THICK OPAQUE SMOKE LIKE COLUMN ASCENDED AT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH A MONSTER WITH THE THROAT AND TEETH OF A CROCODILE A FLAT TREACHEROUS FOREHEAD
7837-109173-0002 THAT CUT ITS WAY INLAND FROM THE LEVEL DEPTHS OF THE GREAT LAKE THE ENTIRE MONSTER MEASURED SCARCELY A FINGER'S LENGTH
7837-109173-0003 THE UPSPRINGING WATER PLANTS VEILED HER BODY AND DREW WAVING SHADOWS OVER HER ROUND SLENDER TAIL WHEN THE SUN WAS SHINING SHE LIKED TO STAY HERE AMONG THE BOTTOM VEGETATION AND IMITATE A DRIFTING PIECE OF REED
7837-109173-0004 SHE SIMPLY WAS A PIECE OF REED EVEN THE SHARP EYED HERON WHICH HAD DROPPED DOWN UNNOTICED ABOUT A DOZEN YARDS OFF AND WAS NOW NOISELESSLY WITH SLOW CAUTIOUS STEPS WADING NEARER AND NEARER
7837-109173-0005 TOOK HER AT THE FIRST GLANCE FOR A STICK ALL THE DITCH WATER LIFE OF A SUMMER DAY WAS PULSATING AROUND THE YOUNG PIKE WATER SPIDERS WENT UP FOR AIR AND CAME DOWN WITH IT BETWEEN THEIR HIND LEGS
7837-109173-0006 TO MOOR THEIR SILVERY DIVING BELLS BENEATH THE WHORLS OF THE WATER MOSS ONE BOAT BUG AFTER ANOTHER WITH A SHINING AIR BUBBLE ON ITS BELLY TO ACT AS A SWIMMING BAG AND FOR OARS A PAIR OF LONG LEGS STICKING FAR OUT AT THE SIDES
7837-109173-0007 DARTED WITH GREAT SPURTS THROUGH THE WATER OR ROSE AND SANK WITH THE SPEED OF A BALLOON THE YOUNG PIKE PEERED UPWARDS AND SAW IN THE SHELTER OF A TUFT OF RUSHES A COLLECTION OF BLACK BOAT SHAPED WHIRLIGIGS
7837-109173-0008 SHOWING LIKE DOTS AGAINST THE SHINING SURFACE THE LITTLE WATER BEETLES LAY AND DOZED BUT ALL AT ONCE A SUDDEN STORM SEEMED TO DESCEND UPON THEM AND THEY SCATTERED PRECIPITATELY WHIRLING AWAY IN WIDER AND WIDER CIRCLES
7837-109173-0009 ONLY TO CONGREGATE AGAIN JUST AS SUDDENLY LIKE A FLOCK OF SHEEP THE YOUNG PIKE DISAPPEARED FROM THE HERON'S VIEW IN A CLOUD OF MUD AND GLIDED OFF TO SOME DISTANCE
7837-109173-0010 FINALLY COMING TO ANCHOR ON A WIDE SUBMERGED PLAIN IN A BROAD CREEK
7837-109173-0011 WHOSE YELLOW FLOWERS GLEAMED OUT FROM AMONG THE CLUSTERS OF GREEN HEART SHAPED LEAVES THERE WAS NEVER ANY PEACE AROUND HER WHEN ONE ANIMAL WAS ON ITS WAY DOWN ANOTHER WOULD BE ON ITS WAY UP
7837-109173-0012 AND THE BED OF OOZE BENEATH HER WAS IN INCESSANT MOTION STICKS MOVED TO RIGHT AND LEFT HAIRY BALLS LAY AND ROLLED OVER ONE ANOTHER THERE WAS A TWISTING AND TURNING OF LARVAE IN ALL DIRECTIONS
7837-109173-0013 THE ACTIVE WATER BEETLES WERE DREDGING INCESSANTLY RELEASING LEAVES AND STALKS WHICH SLOWLY AND WEIRDLY ROSE TO THE SURFACE AIR BUBBLES TOO WERE SET FREE AND ASCENDED QUICKLY WITH A ROTARY MOTION
7837-109173-0014 HERE TWO LARGE TIGER BEETLES WERE FIGHTING WITH A POOR WATER BUG
7837-109173-0015 AND TORE ITS HEAD FROM ITS BODY IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST A PLEASURE TO FIND ONESELF SO NEATLY DESPATCHED EVERYTHING TORTURED AND KILLED DOWN HERE SOME INDEED EVEN DEVOURED THEMSELVES
7837-109173-0016 AND ANYTHING RESTING FOR BUT A MINUTE WAS TAKEN FOR CARRION THE BIG HORSE LEECH HAD WOUND ITS RHYTHMICALLY SERPENTINE WAY THROUGH THE WATER IT WAS TIRED NOW AND HAD JUST STRETCHED ITSELF OUT FOR A MOMENT'S REST
7837-109173-0017 WHEN THE SUPPOSED PIECES OF STICK UPON WHICH IT LAY SEIZED IT AND VORACIOUS HEADS WITH SHARP JAWS ATTACKED ITS FLESH IT WAS WITHIN AN ACE OF BEING MADE CAPTIVE FOR EVER
7837-109173-0018 SHE SAW THAT TO DEVOUR OTHERS AND TO AVOID BEING DEVOURED ONESELF WAS THE END AND AIM OF LIFE FOR A LONG TIME SHE REMAINED QUITE STILL
7837-109173-0019 ONLY AN UNDULATING MOVEMENT OF THE DORSAL FIN AND THE MALICIOUS GLITTER OF THE EYES REVEALING HER VITALITY SLOWLY SHE OPENED AND CLOSED HER SMALL WIDE MOUTH AND LET THE OXIDIZING WATER FLOW OVER HER BLOOD RED GILLS
7837-109173-0020 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER RECENT PERIL AND ONCE MORE BECAME FILLED WITH THE CRUEL PASSION OF THE HUNTER FROM THE SHADOW OF THE MARSH MARIGOLDS SHE DARTED UNDER THE NEWLY UNFOLDED LEAF OF A WATER LILY
7837-109173-0021 THIS WAS A VERY FAVOURITE LURKING PLACE SHE COULD LIE THERE WITH HER BACK RIGHT UP AGAINST THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE LEAF AND HER SNOUT ON THE VERY BORDER OF ITS SHADOW READY TO STRIKE
7837-109173-0022 THE SILVERY FLASH OF SMALL FISH TWINKLED AROUND HER AND MYRIADS OF TINY SHINING CRUSTACEANS WHISKED ABOUT SO CLOSE TO HER NOSE THAT AT ANY MOMENT SHE COULD HAVE SNAPPED THEM UP BY THE SCORE INTO HER VORACIOUS MOUTH
7837-109173-0023 IT WAS ESPECIALLY THINGS THAT MOVED THAT HAD A MAGIC ATTRACTION FOR GRIM FROM THE TIME WHEN BUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN DAYS OLD SHE HAD CONSUMED THE CONTENTS OF HER YOLKSAC AND OPENED HER LARGE VORACIOUS MOUTH
7837-109173-0024 EVERYTHING THAT FLICKERED TWISTED AND MOVED ALL THAT SOUGHT TO ESCAPE AROUSED HER IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE IN THE INNERMOST DEPTHS OF HER BEING THERE WAS AN OVER MASTERING NEED EXPRESSING ITSELF IN AN INSATIABLENESS
7837-109173-0025 A CONVICTION THAT SHE COULD NEVER HAVE ENOUGH AND A FEAR THAT OTHERS WOULD CLEAR THE WATERS OF ALL THAT WAS EATABLE AN INSANE GREED ANIMATED HER AND EVEN WHEN SHE HAD EATEN SO MUCH THAT SHE COULD EAT NO MORE
7837-109173-0026 SHE KEPT SWIMMING ABOUT WITH SPOIL IN HER MOUTH ON THE OTHER HAND ANYTHING AT REST AND QUIET POSSESSED LITTLE ATTRACTION FOR HER
7837-109173-0027 THAT SHE COULD TAKE AT ANY TIME MEANWHILE THE KEEN EYED HERON WADING UP TO ITS BREAST IN THE WATER COMES SOFTLY AND SILENTLY TRAWLING THROUGH THE DITCH
7837-109173-0028 SEDATELY IT GOES ABOUT ITS BUSINESS STALKING ALONG WITH SLOW MEASURED STEPS
7837-109173-0029 THE GULLS DASH UPON IT FROM BEHIND WITH A HISS IT CURVES ITS NECK AND TURNS THE FOIL UPWARDS SNAPPING AND BITING AT ITS TORMENTORS AN IRRITATING LITTLE FLOCK OF GULLS MAY GO ON THUS FOR A LONG TIME
7837-109173-0030 AND WHEN AT LAST SCREAMING AND MOCKING THEY TAKE THEIR DEPARTURE THEY HAVE SPOILT MANY A CHANCE AND WASTED MANY PRECIOUS MINUTES OF THE BIG SILENT PATIENT FISHER'S TIME THE GULLS ONCE GONE
7837-109173-0031 THE HERON APPLIES ITSELF WITH REDOUBLED ZEAL TO ITS BUSINESS FROM VARIOUS ATTACKING POSITIONS ITS BEAK DARTS DOWN INTO THE WATER BUT OFTEN WITHOUT RESULT AND IT HAS TO GO FARTHER AFIELD THEN AT LAST IT CAPTURES A LITTLE EEL
7837-109173-0032 IT IS NOT EASY HOWEVER TO SWALLOW THE WRIGGLING CAPTIVE THE EEL TWISTS AND REFUSES TO BE SWALLOWED SO THE BIRD HAS TO REDUCE ITS LIVELINESS BY ROLLING UP AND DOWN IN ITS SHARP EDGED BEAK THEN IT GLIDES DOWN
7837-109173-0033 THIS TIME TOO FORTUNE IS DISPOSED TO FAVOUR THE YOUNG PIKE THE HERON COMING UP BEHIND HER CAUTIOUSLY BENDS ITS NECK OVER THE DRIFTING PIECE OF REED IT SEES THERE IS SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT IT BUT THINKS IT IS MISTAKEN
7837-109173-0034 AND IS ABOUT TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP FORWARD WHEN ONLY HALF WAY IT PAUSES WITH ITS FOOT IN THE AIR AND THE NEXT MOMENT THE BLOW FALLS GRIM ONLY ONCE MOVED HER TAIL THEN SHE WAS SEIZED
7837-109173-0035 SOMETHING HARD AND SHARP AND STRONG HELD HER FAST AND SHE PASSED HEAD FOREMOST DOWN INTO A WARM NARROW CHANNEL THERE WAS A FEARFUL CRUSH OF FISH IN THE CHANNEL AND MUCH ELBOWING WITH FINS AND TWISTING OF TAILS
7837-109173-0036 SOMETHING BEHIND HER WAS PUSHING BUT THE THRONG IN FRONT BLOCKED THE WAY SHE COULD GET NO FARTHER AND YET SHE GLIDED ON VERY SLOWLY THE THICK SLIMY WATER IN THE CHANNEL BORE THE LIVING MUDDY TANGLE THAT SURROUNDED HER ALONG
7837-109173-0037 SHE FELT THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH RUB AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE CHANNEL SHE COULD SCARCELY BREATHE IN THE MEANTIME THE HERON WAS FLYING HOMEWARDS TO ITS YOUNG CARRYING GRIM AND THE REST OF THE CATCH
7837-109173-0038 OUT ON THE LAKE LAY A BOAT IN WHICH A MAN SAT FISHING EXPERIENCE TOLD THE BIRD IT WAS A FISHERMAN BUT HERE THE BIRD WAS WRONG THE MAN HAD A GUN IN THE BOAT
7837-109173-0039 AND AS THE BIRD SAILED UPWARDS A SHOT WAS FIRED WHICH COMPELLED IT TO RELINQUISH A PART OF ITS BOOTY IN ORDER TO ESCAPE MORE QUICKLY GRIM WAS AMONG THE FORTUNATE ONES SUDDENLY THE CRUSH IN THE LONG DARK CHANNEL GREW LESS
7837-109173-0040 AND THE SLUGGISH STREAM OF MUD THAT WAS BEARING HER ALONG CHANGED ITS COURSE A LITTLE LATER THE STREAM GATHERED FURIOUS PACE AND CARRIED HER WITH IT SHE SAW LIGHT AND FELT SPACE ROUND HER SHE WAS ABLE TO MOVE HER FINS
7837-109173-0041 SHE HAD TIME TO NOTICE HOW SUFFOCATINGLY DRY THE OTHER WORLD WAS IT SEEMED TO DRAW OUT HER ENTRAILS AND ALL HER EFFORTS TO RIGHT HERSELF WERE IN VAIN THEN SHE REGAINED HER NATIVE ELEMENT WATER COVERED HER GILLS
