4447-14919-0000 THE OLD WORKING TERRIER THERE CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN A TIME SINCE THE PERIOD OF THE NORMAN CONQUEST WHEN THE SMALL EARTH DOGS WHICH WE NOW CALL TERRIERS WERE NOT KNOWN IN THESE ISLANDS AND USED BY SPORTING MEN AS ASSISTANTS IN THE CHASE
4447-14919-0001 AND BY HUSBANDMEN FOR THE KILLING OF OBNOXIOUS VERMIN
4447-14919-0002 AND A HUNDRED YEARS LATER DOCTOR CAIUS GAVE POINTED RECOGNITION TO THEIR VALUE IN UNEARTHING THE FOX AND DRAWING THE BADGER ANOTHER SORTE THERE IS WROTE THE DOCTOR'S TRANSLATOR IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX
4447-14919-0003 AFTER THE MANNER AND CUSTOME OF FERRETS IN SEARCHING FOR CONNYES CREEP INTO THE GROUNDE
4447-14919-0004 THAT EYTHER THEY TEARE THEM IN PIECES WITH THEYR TEETH BEYING IN THE BOSOME OF THE EARTH
4447-14919-0005 OR AT THE LEAST THROUGH COCENED FEARE DRIVE THEM OUT OF THEIRE HOLLOW HARBOURS IN SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE COMPELLED TO PREPARE SPEEDIE FLYTE
4447-14919-0006 AND BEING DESIROUS OF THE NEXT ALBEIT NOT THE SAFEST REFUGE ARE OTHERWISE TAKEN AND INTRAPPED WITH SNAYRES AND NETTES LAYDE OVER HOLES TO THE SAME PURPOSE
4447-14919-0007 THE COLOUR SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE ORIGINAL TERRIERS ARE NOT INDICATED BY THE EARLY WRITERS AND ART SUPPLIES BUT VAGUE AND UNCERTAIN EVIDENCE NICHOLAS COX WHO WROTE OF SPORTING DOGS IN THE GENTLEMAN'S RECREATION SIXTEEN SIXTY SEVEN
4447-14919-0008 SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT THE TYPE OF WORKING TERRIER WAS ALREADY FIXED SUFFICIENTLY TO BE DIVIDED INTO TWO KINDS THE ONE HAVING SHAGGY COATS AND STRAIGHT LIMBS THE OTHER SMOOTH COATS AND SHORT BENT LEGS
4447-14919-0009 YET SOME YEARS LATER ANOTHER AUTHORITY BLOME IN THE SAME PUBLICATION WAS MORE GUARDED IN HIS STATEMENTS AS TO THE TERRIER TYPE WHEN HE WROTE EVERYBODY THAT IS A FOX HUNTER IS OF OPINION THAT HE HATH A GOOD BREED
4447-14919-0010 I WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO THE AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE OF THE POINT SEARCHING FOR EVIDENCE ON THE SUBJECT ONE FINDS THAT PERHAPS THE EARLIEST REFERENCES TO THE COLOURS OF TERRIERS WERE MADE BY DANIEL IN HIS FIELD SPORTS AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
4447-14919-0011 WHEN HE DESCRIBED TWO SORTS THE ONE ROUGH SHORT LEGGED AND LONG BACKED VERY STRONG AND MOST COMMONLY OF A BLACK OR YELLOWISH COLOUR MIXED WITH WHITE EVIDENTLY A HOUND MARKED DOG
4447-14919-0012 AND ANOTHER SMOOTH COATED AND BEAUTIFULLY FORMED WITH A SHORTER BODY AND MORE SPRIGHTLY APPEARANCE GENERALLY OF A REDDISH BROWN COLOUR OR BLACK WITH TANNED LEGS
4447-14919-0013 GILPIN'S PORTRAIT OF COLONEL THORNTON'S CELEBRATED PITCH PAINTED IN SEVENTEEN NINETY PRESENTS A TERRIER HAVING A SMOOTH WHITE COAT WITH A BLACK PATCH AT THE SET ON OF THE UNDOCKED TAIL
4447-14919-0014 AND BLACK MARKINGS ON THE FACE AND EARS THE DOG'S HEAD IS BADLY DRAWN AND SMALL IN PROPORTION BUT THE BODY AND LEGS AND COLOURING WOULD HARDLY DISGRACE THE TOTTERIDGE KENNELS OF TO DAY
4447-14919-0015 FOX TERRIERS OF A NOTED STRAIN WERE DEPICTED FROM LIFE BY REINAGLE IN THE SPORTSMAN'S CABINET PUBLISHED OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
4447-14919-0016 AND IN THE TEXT ACCOMPANYING THE ENGRAVING A MINUTE ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE PECULIARITIES AND WORKING CAPACITIES OF THE TERRIER WE ARE TOLD THAT THERE WERE TWO BREEDS THE ONE WIRE HAIRED LARGER MORE POWERFUL AND HARDER BITTEN
4447-14919-0017 THE OTHER SMOOTH HAIRED AND SMALLER WITH MORE STYLE THE WIRE HAIRS WERE WHITE WITH SPOTS THE SMOOTHS WERE BLACK AND TAN THE TAN APPARENTLY PREDOMINATING OVER THE BLACK
4447-14919-0018 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MANY OF THE OLD FOX HUNTERS HAVE KEPT THEIR SPECIAL BREEDS OF TERRIER AND THE BELVOIR THE GROVE AND LORD MIDDLETON'S ARE AMONG THE PACKS TO WHICH PARTICULAR TERRIER STRAINS HAVE BEEN ATTACHED
4447-14919-0019 THAT EVEN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO TERRIERS WERE BRED WITH CARE AND THAT CERTAIN STRAINS WERE HELD IN ESPECIAL VALUE IS SHOWN BY THE RECORDED FACT THAT A LITTER OF SEVEN PUPPIES WAS SOLD FOR TWENTY ONE GUINEAS A GOOD PRICE EVEN IN THESE DAYS
4447-14919-0020 AND THAT ON ONE OCCASION SO HIGH A SUM AS TWENTY GUINEAS WAS PAID FOR A FULL GROWN DOG AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO DEFINITE AND WELL ESTABLISHED BREED RECOGNISED THROUGHOUT THE ISLANDS BY A SPECIFIC NAME THE EMBRACING TITLE OF TERRIER
4447-14919-0021 INCLUDED ALL THE VARIETIES WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN CAREFULLY DIFFERENTIATED BUT VERY MANY OF THE BREEDS EXISTED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCALITIES AWAITING NATIONAL RECOGNITION
4447-14919-0022 OR OTTERS TO BE KILLED TERRIERS OF DEFINITE STRAIN WERE RELIGIOUSLY CHERISHED SEVERAL OF THESE STILL SURVIVE AND ARE AS RESPECTABLE IN DESCENT AND QUITE AS IMPORTANT HISTORICALLY AS SOME OF THE FAVOURED AND FASHIONABLE CHAMPIONS OF OUR TIME
4447-14919-0023 THEY DO NOT PERHAPS POSSESS THE OUTWARD BEAUTY AND DISTINCTION OF TYPE WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY THEIR BEING BROUGHT INTO GENERAL NOTICE BUT AS WORKERS THEY RETAIN ALL THE FIRE AND VERVE THAT ARE REQUIRED IN DOGS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO ENCOUNTER SUCH VICIOUS VERMIN AS THE BADGER AND THE FOX
4447-14919-0024 SOME OF THE BREEDS OF TERRIERS SEEN NOWADAYS IN EVERY DOG SHOW WERE EQUALLY OBSCURE AND UNKNOWN A FEW YEARS BACK THIRTY SEVEN YEARS AGO THE NOW POPULAR IRISH TERRIER WAS PRACTICALLY UNKNOWN IN ENGLAND
4447-14919-0025 AND THE SCOTTISH TERRIER WAS ONLY BEGINNING TO BE RECOGNISED AS A DISTINCT BREED
4447-14919-0026 AND SO RECENTLY AS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE AIREDALE WAS MERELY A LOCAL DOG KNOWN IN YORKSHIRE AS THE WATERSIDE OR THE BINGLEY TERRIER YET THE BREEDS JUST MENTIONED ARE ALL OF UNIMPEACHABLE ANCESTRY
4447-14919-0027 AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY WERE FORMERLY BRED WITHIN LIMITED NEIGHBOURHOODS IS IN ITSELF AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF THEIR PURITY WE HAVE SEEN THE PROCESS OF A SUDDEN LEAP INTO RECOGNITION ENACTED DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS IN CONNECTION WITH THE WHITE TERRIER OF THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS
4447-14919-0028 A DOG WHICH WAS FAMILIARLY KNOWN IN ARGYLLSHIRE CENTURIES AGO YET WHICH HAS ONLY LATELY EMERGED FROM THE HEATHERY HILLSIDES AROUND POLTALLOCH TO BECOME AN ATTRACTION ON THE BENCHES AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE
4447-14919-0029 AND ON THE LAWNS OF THE BOTANICAL GARDENS AND THE EXAMPLE SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IN ANOTHER DECADE OR SO THE NEGLECTED SEALYHAM TERRIER THE IGNORED TERRIER OF THE BORDERS AND THE ALMOST FORGOTTEN JACK RUSSELL STRAIN
4447-14919-0030 MAY HAVE CLAIMED A DUE RECOMPENSE FOR THEIR LONG NEGLECT THERE ARE LOVERS OF THE HARD BITTEN WORKING EARTH DOGS WHO STILL KEEP THESE STRAINS INVIOLATE AND WHO GREATLY PREFER THEM TO THE BETTER KNOWN TERRIERS WHOSE NATURAL ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN TOO OFTEN ATROPHIED
4447-14919-0031 BY A SYSTEM OF ARTIFICIAL BREEDING TO SHOW POINTS FEW OF THESE OLD UNREGISTERED BREEDS WOULD ATTRACT THE EYE OF THE FANCIER ACCUSTOMED TO JUDGE A DOG PARADING BEFORE HIM IN THE SHOW RING TO KNOW THEIR VALUE AND TO APPRECIATE THEIR STERLING GOOD QUALITIES
4447-14919-0032 ONE NEEDS TO WATCH THEM AT WORK ON BADGER OR WHEN THEY HIT UPON THE LINE OF AN OTTER IT IS THEN THAT THEY DISPLAY THE ALERTNESS AND THE DARE DEVIL COURAGE WHICH HAVE WON FOR THE ENGLISH TERRIERS THEIR NAME AND FAME
4447-14919-0033 THE WORKING ATTRIBUTES OF THESE ENERGETIC TERRIERS HAVE LONG BEEN UNDERSTOOD AND THE SMART PLUCKY LITTLE DOGS HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY COVETED BY BREEDERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT THEY HAVE NEVER WON THE POPULARITY THEY DESERVE
4447-14919-0034 FOUGHT AND KILLED SINGLE HANDED A FULL GROWN DOG FOX THE SEALYHAM DERIVES ITS BREED NAME FROM THE SEAT OF THE EDWARDES FAMILY NEAR HAVERFORDWEST IN PEMBROKESHIRE WHERE THE STRAIN HAS BEEN CAREFULLY PRESERVED FOR WELL OVER A CENTURY
4447-14919-0035 BUT ALSO WHITE WITH BLACK OR BROWN MARKINGS OR BROWN WITH BLACK THEY MAY BE AS HEAVY AS SEVENTEEN POUNDS BUT TWELVE POUNDS IS THE AVERAGE WEIGHT SOME YEARS AGO THE BREED SEEMED TO BE ON THE DOWN GRADE
4447-14919-0036 REQUIRING FRESH BLOOD FROM A WELL CHOSEN OUTCROSS ONE HEARS VERY LITTLE CONCERNING THEM NOWADAYS BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT WHEN IN THEIR PRIME THEY POSSESSED ALL THE GRIT DETERMINATION AND ENDURANCE THAT ARE LOOKED FOR IN A GOOD WORKING TERRIER
4447-14919-0037 THERE WAS ALSO IN SHROPSHIRE A WELL KNOWN BREED OF WIRE HAIR TERRIERS BLACK AND TAN ON VERY SHORT LEGS AND WEIGHING ABOUT TEN POUNDS OR TWELVE POUNDS WITH LONG PUNISHING HEADS AND EXTRAORDINARY WORKING POWERS
4447-14919-0038 AND SQUIRE THORNTON AT HIS PLACE NEAR PICKERING IN YORKSHIRE HAD A BREED OF WIRE HAIRS TAN IN COLOUR WITH A BLACK STRIPE DOWN THE BACK THEN THERE IS THE COWLEY STRAIN KEPT BY THE COWLEYS OF CALLIPERS NEAR KING'S LANGLEY
4447-14919-0039 THEY WERE NOT EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE BETTER KNOWN BORDER TERRIERS OF WHICH THERE ARE STILL MANY STRAINS RANGING FROM NORTHUMBERLAND WHERE MISTER T ROBSON OF BELLINGHAM HAS KEPT THEM FOR MANY YEARS
4447-14919-0040 AND THE PITTENWEEM WITH WHICH THE POLTALLOCH TERRIERS ARE NOW BEING CROSSED WHILE MISSUS ALASTAIR CAMPBELL OF ARDRISHAIG HAS A PACK OF CAIRN TERRIERS WHICH SEEM TO REPRESENT THE ORIGINAL TYPE OF THE IMPROVED SCOTTIE
4447-14919-0041 CONSIDERING THE GREAT NUMBER OF STRAINS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESERVED BY SPORTING FAMILIES AND MAINTAINED IN MORE OR LESS PURITY TO TYPE IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW A NEW BREED MAY BECOME FASHIONABLE AND STILL CLAIM THE HONOUR OF LONG DESCENT
4447-14919-0042 THEY MAY NOT IN ALL CASES HAVE THE BEAUTY OF SHAPE WHICH IS DESIRED ON THE SHOW BENCH
