5220-69519-0000 SOME NEW PLENITUDE HAD COME TO HIM SINCE KATE HAD SEEN HIM LAST HIS FULL MANHOOD SEEMED TO BE REALIZED A FINE SERIOUSNESS INVESTED HIM A SERIOUSNESS WHICH INCLUDED THE OBSERVER FELT SURE
5220-69519-0001 ALL IMAGINABLE FIT FORMS OF JOY CLOTHED IN GRAY SAVE FOR THE INEVITABLE SOMBRERO CLEAN SHAVEN BRIGHT EYED CAPABLE RENEWED WITH HOPE
5220-69519-0002 HE TOOK BOTH WOMEN WITH A PROTECTING GESTURE INTO HIS EMBRACE THE THREE REJOICED TOGETHER IN THAT HONEST DEMONSTRATION WHICH SEEMS PERMISSIBLE IN THE WEST WHERE SOCIAL FORMS AND FEARS HAVE NOT MUCH FOOTHOLD
5220-69519-0003 THEY TALKED AS HAPPILY OF LITTLE THINGS AS IF GREAT ONES WERE NOT OCCUPYING THEIR MINDS TO LISTEN ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ONLY LITTLE JOYS AND SMALL VEXATIONS HAD COME THEIR WAY
5220-69519-0004 IT WOULD BE BY LOOKING INTO THEIR FACES THAT ONE COULD SEE THE MARKS OF PASSION THE PASSION OF SORROW OF LOVE OF SACRIFICE AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE PINON GROVE HONORA DISCOVERED HER BABIES
5220-69519-0005 THEY WERE IN WHITE FRESH AS LILIES OR PERHAPS AS LITTLE ANGELS WELL BELOVED OF HEAVENLY MOTHERS AND THEY CAME RUNNING FROM THE HOUSE THEIR GOLDEN HAIR SHINING LIKE AUREOLES ABOUT THEIR EAGER FACES
5220-69519-0006 THEIR SANDALED FEET HARDLY TOUCHED THE GROUND AND INDEED COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WEIGHED AT THAT MOMENT IT SURELY HAD BEEN FOUND THAT THEY HAD BECOME ALMOST IMPONDERABLE BECAUSE OF THE ETHEREAL LIGHTNESS OF THEIR SPIRITS
5220-69519-0007 THEIR ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED THEIR EYES BURNING LIKE THE EYES OF SERAPHS STOP CRIED HONORA TO KARL IN A CHOKING VOICE HE DREW UP HIS RESTLESS HOME BOUND HORSES AND SHE LEAPED TO THE GROUND
5220-69519-0008 AS SHE RAN TOWARD HER LITTLE ONES ON SWIFT FEET THE TWO WHO WATCHED HER WERE CONVINCED THAT SHE HAD REGAINED HER OLD TIME VIGOR AND HAD ACQUIRED AN ELOQUENCE OF PERSONALITY WHICH NEVER BEFORE HAD BEEN HERS
5220-69519-0009 SHE GATHERED HER TREASURES IN HER ARMS AND WALKED WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE KATE HAD NOT MANY MINUTES TO WAIT IN THE LIVING ROOM BEFORE WANDER JOINED HER IT WAS A LONG ROOM WITH TRIPLICATE LOFTY WINDOWS FACING THE MOUNTAINS
5220-69519-0010 WHICH WHEELED IN MAJESTIC SEMICIRCLE FROM NORTH TO WEST AT THIS HOUR THE PURPLE SHADOWS WERE GATHERING ON THEM AND GREAT PEACE AND BEAUTY LAY OVER THE WORLD THERE WAS BUT ONE DOOR TO THIS ROOM AND WANDER CLOSED IT
5220-69519-0011 I MAY AS WELL KNOW MY FATE NOW HE SAID I'VE WAITED FOR THIS FROM THE MOMENT I SAW YOU LAST ARE YOU GOING TO BE MY WIFE KATE HE STOOD FACING HER BREATHING RATHER HEAVILY
5220-69519-0012 HIS FACE COMMANDED TO A TENSE REPOSE MY ANSWER IS NO CRIED KATE HOLDING OUT HER HANDS TO HIM I LOVE YOU AS MY LIFE AND MY ANSWER IS NO
5220-69519-0013 HE TOOK THE HANDS SHE HAD EXTENDED KISS ME HE GATHERED HER INTO HIS ARMS AND UPON HER WELCOMING LIPS
5220-69519-0014 HE LAID HIS OWN IN SUCH A KISS AS A MAN PLACES UPON BUT ONE WOMAN'S LIPS NOW WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER HE BREATHED AFTER A TIME TELL ME YOUR ANSWER NOW YOU MUCH LOVED WOMAN
5220-69519-0015 TELL IT BELOVED SHE KISSED HIS BROW AND HIS EYES HE FELT HER TEARS UPON HIS CHEEKS YOU KNOW ALL THAT I HAVE THOUGHT AND FELT SHE SAID
5220-69519-0016 YOU KNOW FOR I HAVE WRITTEN WHAT MY LIFE MAY BE DO YOU ASK ME TO LET IT GO AND TO LIVE HERE IN THIS SOLITUDE WITH YOU YES BY HEAVEN HE SAID HIS EYES BLAZING I ASK IT
5220-69519-0017 SOME INFLUENCE HAD GONE OUT FROM THEM WHICH SEEMED TO CREATE A PALPITANT ATMOSPHERE OF DELIGHT IN WHICH THEY STOOD IT WAS AS IF THE SPIRITUAL ESSENCE OF THEM MINGLING
5220-69519-0018 HAD FORMED THE PERFECT FLUID OF THE SOUL IN WHICH IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO LIVE AND BREATHE AND DREAM I AM SO BLESSED IN YOU WHISPERED KARL SO COMPLETED BY YOU
5220-69519-0019 THAT I CANNOT LET YOU GO EVEN THOUGH YOU GO ON TO GREAT USEFULNESS AND GREAT GOODNESS I TELL YOU YOUR PLACE IS HERE IN MY HOME IT IS SAFE HERE
5220-69519-0020 I WARNED YOU OF ITS DANGER YOU TOLD ME OF ITS GLORY BUT I REPEAT MY WARNING NOW FOR I SEE YOU VENTURING ON TO THAT PRECIPICE OF LONELINESS AND FAME ON WHICH NONE BUT SAD AND LONELY WOMEN STAND
5220-69519-0021 OH I KNOW WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE KARL I MEAN TO DO MY WORK WITH ALL THE POWER THERE IS IN ME AND I SHALL BE REJOICING IN THAT AND IN LIFE IT'S IN ME TO BE GLAD MERELY THAT I'M LIVING
5220-69519-0022 BUT DEEP WITHIN MY HEART I SHALL AS YOU SAY BE BOTH LONELY AND SAD IF THERE'S ANY COMFORT IN THAT FOR YOU NO THERE'S NO COMFORT AT ALL FOR ME IN THAT KATE
5220-69519-0023 STAY WITH ME STAY WITH ME BE MY WIFE WHY IT'S YOUR DESTINY KATE CROSSED THE ROOM AS IF SHE WOULD MOVE BEYOND THAT AURA WHICH VIBRATED ABOUT HIM
5220-69519-0024 AND IN WHICH SHE COULD NOT STAND WITHOUT A TOO DANGEROUS DELIGHT SHE WAS VERY PALE
5220-69519-0025 I MEAN TO BE THE MOTHER TO MANY MANY CHILDREN KARL SHE SAID IN A VOICE WHICH THRILLED WITH SORROW AND PRIDE AND A STRANGE JOY TO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN
5220-69519-0026 BUT FOR THE IDEA I REPRESENT AND THE WORK I MEAN TO DO THEY WOULD BE TRAMPLED IN THE DUST OF THE WORLD CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I AM CALLED TO THIS AS MEN ARE CALLED TO HONORABLE SERVICES FOR THEIR COUNTRY
5220-69519-0027 THIS IS A WOMAN'S FORM OF PATRIOTISM IT'S A HIGHER ONE THAN THE SOLDIER'S I THINK IT'S COME MY WAY TO BE THE BANNER CARRIER AND I'M GLAD OF IT
5220-69519-0028 I TAKE MY CHANCE AND MY HONOR JUST AS YOU WOULD TAKE YOUR CHANCE AND YOUR HONOR BUT I COULD RESIGN THE GLORY KARL FOR YOUR LOVE AND COUNT IT WORTH WHILE KATE
5220-69519-0029 BUT THE THING TO WHICH I AM FAITHFUL IS MY OPPORTUNITY FOR GREAT SERVICE COME WITH ME KARL MY DEAR THINK HOW WE COULD WORK TOGETHER IN WASHINGTON
5220-69519-0030 THINK WHAT SUCH A BRAIN AND HEART AS YOURS WOULD MEAN TO A NEW CAUSE WE'D LOSE OURSELVES AND FIND OURSELVES LABORING FOR ONE OF THE KINDEST LOVINGEST IDEAS THE HARD OLD WORLD HAS YET DEVISED WILL YOU COME AND HELP ME KARL
5220-69519-0031 MAN HE MOVED TOWARD HER HIS HANDS OUTSPREAD WITH A PROTESTING GESTURE YOU KNOW THAT ALL MY WORK IS HERE KATE THIS IS MY HOME THESE MINES ARE MINE THE TOWN IS MINE
5220-69519-0032 IT IS NOT ONLY MY OWN MONEY WHICH IS INVESTED BUT THE MONEY OF OTHER MEN FRIENDS WHO HAVE TRUSTED ME AND WHOSE PROSPERITY DEPENDS UPON ME OH BUT KARL AREN'T THERE WAYS OF ARRANGING SUCH THINGS
5220-69519-0033 YOU SAY I AM DEAR TO YOU TRANSFER YOUR INTERESTS AND COME WITH ME KARL HER VOICE WAS A PLEADER'S YET IT KEPT ITS PRIDE
5220-69519-0034 KATE HOW CAN I DO YOU WANT ME TO BE A SUPPLEMENT TO YOU A HANGER ON DON'T YOU SEE THAT YOU WOULD MAKE ME RIDICULOUS WOULD I SAID KATE DOES IT SEEM THAT WAY TO YOU
5220-69519-0035 THEN YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED TO RESPECT ME AFTER ALL I WORSHIP YOU HE CRIED KATE SMILED SADLY I KNOW SHE SAID BUT WORSHIP PASSES NO HE FLUNG OUT
5220-69519-0036 STARTING TOWARD HER BUT SHE HELD HIM BACK WITH A GESTURE YOU HAVE STOLEN MY WORD SHE SAID WITH AN ACCENT OF FINALITY NO IS THE WORD YOU FORCE ME TO SPEAK I AM GOING ON TO WASHINGTON IN THE MORNING KARL
5220-69519-0037 NESTLING AGAINST HER DARK ONE AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM MOVING UNSEEINGLY SHE HEARD THE HARD WRUNG GROAN THAT CAME FROM HIS LIPS A MOMENT LATER AS SHE MOUNTED THE STAIRS SHE SAW HIM STRIDING UP THE TRAIL
5220-69519-0038 WHICH THEY TOGETHER HAD ASCENDED ONCE WHEN THE SUN OF THEIR HOPE WAS STILL HIGH SHE DID NOT MEET HIM AGAIN THAT DAY SHE AND HONORA ATE THEIR MEALS IN SILENCE HONORA DARK WITH DISAPPROVAL
5220-69519-0039 KATE CLINGING TO HER SPAR OF SPIRITUAL INTEGRITY IF THAT NO THUNDERED IN KARL'S EARS THE NIGHT THROUGH WHILE HE KEPT THE COMPANY OF HIS ANCIENT COMFORTERS THE MOUNTAINS
5220-69519-0040 NO LESS DID IT BEAT SHATTERINGLY IN THE EARS OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD SPOKEN IT NO TO THE DEEP AND MYSTIC HUMAN JOYS NO TO THE MOST HOLY PRIVILEGE OF WOMEN
5220-69519-0041 NO TO LIGHT LAUGHTER AND A DANCING HEART NO TO THE LOWLY SATISFYING LABOR OF A HOME FOR HER THE STEEP PATH ALONE FOR HER THE PRECIPICE
5220-69519-0042 FROM IT SHE MIGHT BEHOLD THE SUNRISE AND ALL THE GLORY OF THE WORLD BUT NO EXALTED SENSE OF DUTY OR OF VICTORY COULD BLIND HER TO ITS SOLITUDE AND TO ITS DANGER YET NOW IF EVER
5220-69519-0043 WOMEN MUST BE TRUE TO THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH ALL THE AGES WILLING MARTYRS TO THE GENERAL GOOD NOW IT WAS LAID UPON THEM TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A NEW CRUSADE TO UNDERTAKE A FRESH MARTYRDOM
5220-69519-0044 AND THIS TIME IT WAS FOR THEMSELVES LEAGUED AGAINST THEM WAS HALF QUITE HALF OF THEIR SEX VANITY AND PRETTINESS DALLIANCE AND DEPENDENCE WERE THEIR CHARACTERISTICS
5220-69519-0045 WITH A SHRUG OF HALF BARED SHOULDERS THEY DISMISSED ALL THOSE WHO PAINFULLY NOBLY GRAVELY WERE FIGHTING TO RESTORE WOMAN'S CONNECTION WITH REALITY TO PUT HER BACK SOMEHOW INTO THE PROCESSION
5220-69519-0046 TO MAKE BY NEW METHODS THE COMING LADY AS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMMONWEALTH AS WAS THE OLD TIME CHATELAINE BEFORE COMMERCIALISM FILCHED HER VOCATIONS AND LEFT HER THE MOST CULTIVATED AND USELESS OF PARASITES
5220-69519-0047 OH IT WAS NO LITTLE THING FOR WHICH SHE WAS FIGHTING KATE TRIED TO CONSOLE HERSELF WITH THAT IF SHE PASSIONATELY DESIRED TO CREATE AN ORGANIZATION WHICH SHOULD EXERCISE PARENTAL POWERS OVER ORPHANED OR POORLY GUARDED CHILDREN
5220-69519-0048 STILL MORE DID SHE WISH TO SET AN EXAMPLE OF EFFICIENCY FOR WOMEN ILLUSTRATING TO THEM WITH HOW FIRM A STEP WOMAN MIGHT TREAD THE HIGHER ALTITUDES OF PUBLIC LIFE MAKING AN ACHIEVEMENT NOT A COMPROMISE OF LABOR
5220-69519-0049 MOREOVER NO OTHER WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY HAD AT PRESENT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY THAT EQUALED HER OWN LOOK AT IT HOW SHE WOULD THROB AS SHE MIGHT WITH A WOMAN'S IMMEMORIAL NOSTALGIA FOR A TRUE MAN'S LOVE
5220-69519-0050 SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE RELENTLESS LOGIC OF THE SITUATION
