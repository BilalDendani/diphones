1779-142733-0000 BOOK THREE
1779-142733-0001 CHAPTER ONE THE MIND HAS AN INCOMPLETE LIFE THE PROBLEM OF THE UNION OF THE MIND AND THE BODY IS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHICH PRESENT THEMSELVES IN PURE SPECULATION
1779-142733-0002 IT HAS ITS ROOTS IN EXPERIMENTAL FACTS AND IS FORCED UPON US BY THE NECESSITY OF EXPLAINING OBSERVATIONS SUCH AS THOSE WE ARE ABOUT TO QUOTE THE FORCE OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS THE CORRECTNESS OF OUR JUDGMENTS
1779-142733-0003 OUR TEMPERS AND OUR CHARACTERS THE STATE OF HEALTH OF OUR MINDS AND ALSO THEIR TROUBLES THEIR WEAKNESSES AND EVEN THEIR EXISTENCE ARE ALL IN A STATE OF STRICT DEPENDENCE ON THE CONDITION OF OUR BODIES MORE PRECISELY
1779-142733-0004 WITH THAT OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEMS OR MORE PRECISELY STILL WITH THE STATE OF THOSE THREE POUNDS OF PROTEID SUBSTANCE WHICH EACH OF US HAS AT THE BACK OF HIS FOREHEAD AND WHICH ARE CALLED OUR BRAINS
1779-142733-0005 THIS IS DAILY DEMONSTRATED BY THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF OBSERVATIONS THE QUESTION IS TO KNOW HOW THIS UNION OF THE BODY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS IS TO BE EXPLAINED IT BEING ASSUMED THAT THE TWO TERMS OF THIS UNION
1779-142733-0006 PRESENT A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THEIR NATURE THE EASIER IT SEEMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS UNION EXISTS THE MORE DIFFICULT IT APPEARS TO EXPLAIN HOW IT IS REALISED AND THE PROOF OF THIS DIFFICULTY
1779-142733-0007 IS THE NUMBER OF DIVERGENT INTERPRETATIONS GIVEN TO IT WERE IT A SIMPLE QUESTION OF FACT THE PERPETUAL DISCUSSIONS AND CONTROVERSIES UPON IT WOULD NOT ARISE MANY PROBLEMS HERE PRESENT THEMSELVES
1779-142733-0008 THE FIRST IS THAT OF THE GENESIS OR ORIGIN OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS IT HAS TO BE EXPLAINED
1779-142733-0009 IN GENERAL ONE BEGINS BY SUPPOSING THAT THE MATERIAL PHENOMENA ARE PRODUCED FIRST THEY CONSIST FOR INSTANCE IN THE WORKING OF THE NERVOUS CENTRES ALL THIS IS PHYSICAL OR CHEMICAL AND THEREFORE MATERIAL
1779-142733-0010 THEN AT A GIVEN MOMENT AFTER THIS MECHANICAL PROCESS A QUITE DIFFERENT PHENOMENON EMERGES THIS IS THOUGHT CONSCIOUSNESS EMOTION THEN COMES THE QUESTION
1779-142733-0011 IS CAPABLE OF EXPLANATION AND HOW THOUGHT IS CONNECTED WITH ITS PHYSICAL ANTECEDENTS WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE LINK BETWEEN THEM IS IT A RELATION OF CAUSE TO EFFECT OF GENESIS OR A COINCIDENCE
1779-142733-0012 OR THE INTERACTION OF TWO DISTINCT FORCES IS THIS RELATION CONSTANT OR NECESSARY CAN THE MIND ENJOY AN EXISTENCE INDEPENDENT OF THE BRAIN CAN IT SURVIVE THE DEATH OF THE BRAIN
1779-142733-0013 THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT OF KNOWING WHAT IS THE ROLE THE UTILITY AND THE EFFICACITY OF THE PSYCHICAL PHENOMENON ONCE FORMED THIS PHENOMENON EVOLVES IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION AND ASSUMES TO US WHO HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT
1779-142733-0014 A VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE WHAT IS ITS ACTION ON THE MATERIAL PHENOMENA OF THE BRAIN WHICH SURROUND IT DOES IT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO LAWS OF ITS OWN WHICH HAVE NO RELATION TO THE LAWS OF BRAIN ACTION
1779-142733-0015 DOES IT EXERCISE ANY ACTION ON THESE INTRA CEREBRAL FUNCTIONS DOES IT EXERCISE ANY ACTION ON THE CENTRIFUGAL CURRENTS WHICH GO TO THE MOTOR NERVES IS IT CAPABLE OF EXCITING A MOVEMENT
1779-142733-0016 OR IS IT DEPRIVED OF ALL POWER OF CREATING EFFECT WE WILL BRIEFLY EXAMINE THE PRINCIPAL SOLUTIONS WHICH THE IMAGINATION OF MANKIND HAS FOUND FOR THESE VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS SOME OF THE BEST KNOWN OF THESE SOLUTIONS
1779-142733-0017 MATERIALISM PARALLELISM AND MONISM
1779-142733-0018 BEFORE BEGINNING OUR CRITICAL STATEMENT LET US RECALL SOME OF THE RESULTS OF OUR PREVIOUS ANALYSES WHICH HERE INTRUDE THEMSELVES TO USE THE AMBITIOUS LANGUAGE OF KANT
1779-142733-0019 AS THE PROLEGOMENA TO EVERY FUTURE SOLUTION WHICH CLAIMS THE TITLE OF SCIENCE IN FACT
1779-142733-0020 WE HAVE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXACTNESS OF CERTAIN FACTS AND WE ARE BOUND TO ADMIT THEIR CONSEQUENCES NOTABLY THE DEFINITION OF PSYCHICAL PHENOMENA AT WHICH WE ARRIVED NOT WITHOUT SOME TROUBLE WILL HENCEFORTH
1779-142733-0021 PLAY A RATHER LARGE PART IN OUR DISCUSSION IT WILL FORCE US TO QUESTION A GREAT METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE WHICH UP TILL NOW HAS BEEN ALMOST UNIVERSALLY CONSIDERED AS GOVERNING THE PROBLEM OF THE UNION OF THE MIND WITH THE BODY
1779-142733-0022 THIS PRINCIPLE BEARS THE NAME OF THE AXIOM OF HETEROGENEITY OR THE PRINCIPLE OF PSYCHO PHYSICAL DUALISM NO PHILOSOPHER HAS MORE CLEARLY FORMULATED IT
1779-142733-0023 AND MORE LOGICALLY DEDUCED ITS CONSEQUENCES THAN FLOURNOY THIS AUTHOR HAS WRITTEN A LITTLE PAMPHLET CALLED
1779-142733-0024 WHEREIN HE BRIEFLY SETS FORTH ALL THE KNOWN SYSTEMS OF METAPHYSICS BY REDUCING THEM TO THE SO CALLED PRINCIPLE OF HETEROGENEITY AFTER THIS THE SAME PRINCIPLE ENABLES HIM TO EXECUTE THEM
1779-142733-0025 WHAT ANALOGY CAN YOU SEE BETWEEN THIS DRAWING TOGETHER OR MOVING APART OF MATERIAL MASSES IN SPACE AND THE FACT OF HAVING A FEELING OF JOY THE RECOLLECTION OF AN ABSENT FRIEND THE PERCEPTION OF A GAS JET A DESIRE
1779-142733-0026 OR OF AN ACT OF VOLITION OF ANY KIND AND FURTHER ON ALL THAT WE CAN SAY TO CONNECT TWO EVENTS SO ABSOLUTELY DISSIMILAR IS THAT THEY TAKE PLACE AT THE SAME TIME
1779-142733-0027 THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE WISH TO REDUCE THEM TO UNITY
1779-142733-0028 ANY INTERNAL RELATION BETWEEN THESE TWO UNCONNECTED THINGS LET US NOT HESITATE TO DENOUNCE AS FALSE THIS PROPOSITION WHICH IS PRESENTED TO US AS AN AXIOM ON LOOKING CLOSELY INTO IT
1779-142733-0029 WE SHALL PERCEIVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF HETEROGENEITY DOES NOT CONTAIN THE CONSEQUENCES IT IS SOUGHT TO ASCRIBE TO IT IT SEEMS TO ME IT SHOULD BE SPLIT UP INTO TWO PROPOSITIONS OF VERY UNEQUAL VALUE ONE
1779-142733-0030 THE MIND AND BODY ARE HETEROGENEOUS TWO BY VIRTUE OF THIS HETEROGENEITY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND ANY DIRECT RELATION BETWEEN THE TWO NOW
1779-142733-0031 IF THE FIRST PROPOSITION IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN THE SENSE THAT CONSCIOUSNESS AND MATTER ARE HETEROGENEOUS THE SECOND PROPOSITION SEEMS TO US DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO THE FACTS WHICH SHOW US THAT THE PHENOMENA OF CONSCIOUSNESS
1779-142733-0032 ARE INCOMPLETE PHENOMENA THE CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ITSELF AS WE HAVE SAID IT CANNOT EXIST BY ITSELF THIS AGAIN IF YOU LIKE IS AN AXIOM
1779-142733-0033 OR RATHER IT IS A FACT SHOWN BY OBSERVATION AND CONFIRMED BY REFLECTION MIND AND MATTER BROUGHT DOWN TO THE ESSENTIAL TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS OBJECT FORM A NATURAL WHOLE
1779-142733-0034 AND THE DIFFICULTY DOES NOT CONSIST IN UNITING BUT IN SEPARATING THEM CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACT I EXPERIENCE A SENSATION AND I HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT THIS IS THE COUPLING OF TWO THINGS A SENSATION
1779-142733-0035 AND A COGNITION THE TWO ELEMENTS IF WE INSIST UPON IT ARE HETEROGENEOUS AND THEY DIFFER QUALITATIVELY BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXISTING PREJUDICE BY REASON OF WHICH NO DIRECT RELATION NO COMMERCE
1779-142733-0036 CAN BE ADMITTED BETWEEN HETEROGENEOUS FACTS THE ALLIANCE OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SENSATION IS THE NATURAL AND PRIMITIVE FACT THEY CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED BY ANALYSIS
1779-142733-0037 AND A SCRUPULOUS MIND MIGHT EVEN ASK WHETHER ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO SEPARATE THEM I HAVE A SENSATION AND I HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT IF NOT TWO FACTS THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME NOW
1779-142733-0038 SENSATION IS MATTER AND MY CONSCIOUSNESS IS MIND IF I AM JUDGING AN ASSORTMENT OF STUFFS THIS ASSORTMENT OR THE SENSATION I HAVE OF THEM IS A PARTICLE OF MATTER A MATERIAL STATE AND MY JUDGMENT ON THIS SENSATION
1779-142733-0039 IS THE PSYCHICAL PHENOMENON WE CAN NEITHER BELIEVE NOR DESIRE NOR DO ANY ACT OF OUR INTELLIGENCE WITHOUT REALISING THIS WELDING TOGETHER OF MIND AND MATTER
1779-142733-0040 THEY ARE AS INSEPARABLE AS MOTION AND THE OBJECT THAT MOVES AND THIS COMPARISON THOUGH FAR FETCHED IS REALLY VERY CONVENIENT MOTION CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT A MOBILE OBJECT
1779-142733-0041 AND AN OBJECT ON THE OTHER HAND CAN EXIST WITHOUT MOVEMENT IN THE SAME WAY SENSATION MAY EXIST WITHOUT THE CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THE CONVERSE PROPOSITION CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT SENSATION WITHOUT AN OBJECT
1779-142733-0042 AN EMPTY CONSCIOUSNESS OR A PURE THOUGHT CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD LET US MARK CLEARLY HOW THIS UNION IS PUT FORWARD BY US WE DESCRIBE IT AFTER NATURE IT IS OBSERVATION WHICH REVEALS TO US
1779-142733-0043 THE UNION AND THE FUSION OF THE TWO TERMS INTO ONE OR RATHER WE DO NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR UNION UNTIL THE MOMENT WHEN BY A PROCESS OF ANALYSIS WE SUCCEED IN CONVINCING OURSELVES
1779-142733-0044 THAT THAT WHICH WE AT FIRST CONSIDERED SINGLE IS REALLY DOUBLE OR IF YOU LIKE CAN BE MADE INTO TWO BY THE REASON WITHOUT BEING SO IN REALITY THUS IT HAPPENS THAT WE BRING THIS BIG PROBLEM IN METAPHYSICS
1779-142733-0045 ON TO THE FIELD OF OBSERVATION OUR SOLUTION VAGUELY RESEMBLES THAT WHICH HAS SOMETIMES BEEN PRESENTED UNDER THE ANCIENT NAME OF PHYSICAL INFLUX OR UNDER THE MORE MODERN NAME OF INTER ACTIONISM
1779-142733-0046 THERE ARE MANY AUTHORS WHO MAINTAIN THAT THE SOUL CAN ACT DIRECTLY ON THE BODY AND MODIFY IT AND THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED INTER ACTIONISM THEREBY IS UNDERSTOOD IF I MISTAKE NOT
1779-142733-0047 AN ACTION FROM CAUSE TO EFFECT PRODUCED BETWEEN TWO TERMS WHICH ENJOY A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE WITH REGARD TO EACH OTHER THIS INTERPRETATION IS INDUBITABLY CLOSE TO OURS THOUGH NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH IT
1779-142733-0048 MY PERSONAL INTERPRETATION SETS ASIDE THE IDEA OF ALL INDEPENDENCE OF THE MIND SINCE IT ATTRIBUTES TO THE MIND AN INCOMPLETE AND AS IT WERE A VIRTUAL EXISTENCE IF WE HAD TO SEEK PATERNITY FOR IDEAS
1779-142733-0049 I WOULD MUCH RATHER TURN TO ARISTOTLE IT WAS NOT WITHOUT SOME SURPRISE THAT I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT THE ABOVE THEORY OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SOUL AND THE BODY IS TO BE FOUND ALMOST IN ITS ENTIRETY
1779-142733-0050 IN THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER IT IS TRUE THAT IT IS MIXED UP WITH MANY ACCESSORY IDEAS WHICH ARE OUT OF DATE AND WHICH WE NOW REJECT BUT THE ESSENTIAL OF THE THEORY IS THERE VERY CLEARLY FORMULATED
1779-142733-0051 AND THAT IS THE IMPORTANT POINT A FEW DETAILS ON THIS SUBJECT WILL NOT BE OUT OF PLACE I GIVE THEM NOT FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE WHICH I AM NOT ERUDITE ENOUGH TO CONSULT DIRECT BUT FROM THE LEARNED TREATISE
1779-142733-0052 WHICH BAIN HAS PUBLISHED ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ARISTOTLE AS AN APPENDIX TO HIS WORK ON THE SENSES AND THE INTELLIGENCE THE WHOLE METAPHYSICS OF ARISTOTLE IS DOMINATED BY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FORM AND MATTER
1779-142733-0053 THIS DISTINCTION IS BORROWED FROM THE MOST FAMILIAR FACT IN THE SENSIBLE WORLD THE FORM OF SOLID OBJECTS WE MAY NAME A SUBSTANCE WITHOUT TROUBLING OURSELVES AS TO THE FORM IT POSSESSES AND WE MAY NAME THE FORM
1779-142733-0054 WITHOUT REGARD TO THE SUBSTANCE THAT IT CLOTHES BUT THIS DISTINCTION IS A PURELY ABSTRACT ONE FOR THERE CAN BE NO REAL SEPARATION OF FORM FROM MATTER NO FORM WITHOUT MATTER AND NO MATTER WITHOUT FORM
1779-142733-0055 THE TWO TERMS ARE CORRELATIVE EACH ONE IMPLIES THE OTHER AND NEITHER CAN BE REALISED OR ACTUALISED WITHOUT THE OTHER EVERY INDIVIDUAL SUBSTANCE CAN BE CONSIDERED FROM A TRIPLE POINT OF VIEW
1779-142733-0056 FIRST FORM SECOND MATTER AND THIRD THE COMPOUND OR AGGREGATE OF FORM AND MATTER
1779-142733-0057 WHICH TRANSPORTS US OUT OF THE DOMAIN OF LOGIC AND ABSTRACTION INTO THAT OF REALITY ARISTOTLE RECOGNISES BETWEEN THESE TWO LOGICAL CORRELATIVES A DIFFERENCE IN RANK FORM IS SUPERIOR NOBLER
1779-142733-0058 THE HIGHER IN DIGNITY NEARER TO THE PERFECT ENTITY MATTER IS INFERIOR MORE MODEST MORE DISTANT FROM PERFECTION ON ACCOUNT OF ITS HIERARCHICAL INFERIORITY MATTER IS OFTEN PRESENTED AS THE SECOND
1779-142733-0059 OR CORRELATUM AND FORM AS THE FIRST
1779-142733-0060 THIS DIFFERENCE IN RANK IS SO STRONGLY MARKED THAT THESE TWO CORRELATIONS ARE LIKEWISE CONCEIVED IN A DIFFERENT FORM THAT OF THE POTENTIAL AND THE ACTUAL MATTER IS THE POTENTIAL IMPERFECT
1779-142733-0061 ROUGHLY OUTLINED ELEMENT WHICH IS NOT YET ACTUAL AND MAY PERHAPS NEVER BECOME SO FORM IS THE ACTUAL THE ENERGY THE ENTELECHY WHICH ACTUALISES THE POTENTIAL AND DETERMINES THE FINAL COMPOUND
1779-142733-0062 THESE FEW DEFINITIONS WILL MAKE CLEAR THE SINGULARLY INGENIOUS IDEA OF ARISTOTLE ON THE NATURE OF THE BODY THE SOUL AND OF THEIR UNION THE BODY IS MATTER WHICH IS ONLY INTELLIGIBLE AS THE CORRELATUM OF FORM
1779-142733-0063 IT CAN NEITHER EXIST BY ITSELF NOR BE KNOWN BY ITSELF THAT IS TO SAY WHEN CONSIDERED OUTSIDE THIS RELATION THE SOUL IS FORM THE ACTUAL BY UNITING WITH THE BODY IT CONSTITUTES THE LIVING SUBJECT
1779-142733-0064 THE SOUL IS THE RELATUM AND IS UNINTELLIGIBLE AND VOID OF SENSE WITHOUT ITS CORRELATUM THE SOUL SAYS ARISTOTLE IS NOT A VARIETY OF BODY BUT IT COULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT A BODY
1779-142733-0065 THE SOUL IS NOT A BODY BUT SOMETHING WHICH BELONGS OR IS RELATIVE TO A BODY THE ANIMATED SUBJECT IS A FORM PLUNGED AND ENGAGED IN MATTER AND ALL ITS ACTIONS AND PASSIONS ARE SO LIKEWISE
1779-142733-0066 EACH HAS ITS FORMAL SIDE WHICH CONCERNS THE SOUL AND ITS MATERIAL SIDE WHICH CONCERNS THE BODY THE EMOTION WHICH BELONGS TO THE ANIMATED SUBJECT OR AGGREGATE OF SOUL AND BODY
1779-142733-0067 IS A COMPLEX FACT HAVING TWO ASPECTS LOGICALLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM EACH OTHER EACH OF WHICH IS CORRELATIVE TO THE OTHER AND IMPLIES IT IT IS THUS NOT ONLY WITH OUR PASSIONS BUT ALSO WITH OUR PERCEPTIONS
1779-142733-0068 OUR IMAGINATIONS REMINISCENCES REASONINGS AND EFFORTS OF ATTENTION TO LEARN INTELLIGENCE LIKE EMOTION IS A PHENOMENON NOT SIMPLY OF THE CORPOREAL ORGANISM
1779-142733-0069 BUT OF THE COMMONALTY OR ASSOCIATION OF WHICH THEY ARE MEMBERS AND WHEN THE INTELLIGENCE WEAKENS
1779-142733-0070 BUT BECAUSE THE ASSOCIATION IS DESTROYED BY THE RUIN OF THE CORPOREAL ORGANISM THESE FEW NOTES WHICH I HAVE TAKEN IN THEIR INTEGRITY FROM BAIN'S TEXT ALLOW US THOROUGHLY TO COMPREHEND THE THOUGHT OF ARISTOTLE
1779-142733-0071 AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER BY MAKING OF THE SOUL AND BODY TWO CORRELATIVE TERMS HAS FORMED A COMPARISON OF GREAT EXACTNESS I ALSO MUCH ADMIRE HIS IDEA ACCORDING TO WHICH
1779-142733-0072 IT IS THROUGH THE UNION OF THE BODY AND SOUL THAT THE WHOLE WHICH TILL THEN WAS ONLY POSSIBLE GOES FORTH FROM THE DOMAIN OF LOGIC AND BECOMES ACTUAL THE SOUL ACTUALISES THE BODY
1779-142733-0073 AND BECOMES AS HE SAID ITS ENTELECHY THESE VIEWS ARE TOO CLOSE TO THOSE I HAVE MYSELF JUST SET FORTH FOR IT TO BE NECESSARY TO DWELL ON THEIR RESEMBLANCE THE LATTER WOULD BECOME STILL STRONGER
1779-142733-0074 IF WE SEPARATED FROM THE THOUGHT OF ARISTOTLE A FEW DEVELOPMENTS WHICH ARE NOT ESSENTIAL THOUGH HE ALLOWED THEM GREAT IMPORTANCE I REFER TO THE CONTINUAL COMPARISON HE MAKES WITH THE FORM AND MATTER OF CORPOREAL OBJECTS
1779-142733-0075 HAPPY THOUGH IT MAY BE THIS COMPARISON IS BUT A METAPHOR WHICH PERHAPS FACILITATES THE UNDERSTANDING OF ARISTOTLE'S IDEA BUT IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO HIS THEORY FOR MY PART
1779-142733-0076 I ATTACH FAR GREATER IMPORTANCE TO THE CHARACTER OF RELATUM AND CORRELATUM ASCRIBED TO THE TWO TERMS MIND AND MATTER
1779-142733-0077 LET ME ADD ANOTHER POINT OF COMPARISON ARISTOTLE'S THEORY RECALLS IN A STRIKING MANNER THAT OF KANT ON THE A PRIORI FORMS OF THOUGHT THE FORM OF THOUGHT OR THE CATEGORY
1779-142733-0078 IS NOTHING WITHOUT THE MATTER OF COGNITION AND THE LATTER IS NOTHING WITHOUT THE APPLICATION OF FORM THOUGHTS WITHOUT CONTENT GIVEN BY SENSATION ARE EMPTY INTUITIONS WITHOUT CONCEPT FURNISHED BY THE UNDERSTANDING ARE BLIND
1779-142733-0079 THERE IS NOTHING ASTONISHING IN FINDING HERE THE SAME ILLUSTRATION
1779-142733-0080 THE RELATION OF MIND TO MATTER THERE REMAINS TO US TO REVIEW THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF METAPHYSICAL SYSTEMS WE SHALL DISCUSS THESE BY TAKING AS OUR GUIDE THE PRINCIPLE WE HAVE JUST EVOLVED AND WHICH MAY BE THUS FORMULATED
