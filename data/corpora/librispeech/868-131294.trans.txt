868-131294-0000 HAVE YOU HEARD THE TAOIST TALE OF THE TAMING OF THE HARP ONCE IN THE HOARY AGES IN THE RAVINE OF LUNGMEN STOOD A KIRI TREE A VERITABLE KING OF THE FOREST IT REARED ITS HEAD TO TALK TO THE STARS ITS ROOTS STRUCK DEEP INTO THE EARTH
868-131294-0001 FOR LONG THE INSTRUMENT WAS TREASURED BY THE EMPEROR OF CHINA BUT ALL IN VAIN WERE THE EFFORTS OF THOSE WHO IN TURN TRIED TO DRAW MELODY FROM ITS STRINGS IN RESPONSE TO THEIR UTMOST STRIVINGS THERE CAME FROM THE HARP BUT HARSH NOTES OF DISDAIN
868-131294-0002 ONCE MORE THE SWEET BREATH OF SPRING PLAYED AMIDST ITS BRANCHES THE YOUNG CATARACTS AS THEY DANCED DOWN THE RAVINE LAUGHED TO THE BUDDING FLOWERS ANON WERE HEARD THE DREAMY VOICES OF SUMMER WITH ITS MYRIAD INSECTS THE GENTLE PATTERING OF RAIN
868-131294-0003 NOW WINTER REIGNS AND THROUGH THE SNOW FILLED AIR SWIRL FLOCKS OF SWANS AND RATTLING HAILSTONES BEAT UPON THE BOUGHS WITH FIERCE DELIGHT THEN PEIWOH CHANGED THE KEY AND SANG OF LOVE
868-131294-0004 THE FOREST SWAYED LIKE AN ARDENT SWAIN DEEP LOST IN THOUGHT ON HIGH LIKE A HAUGHTY MAIDEN SWEPT A CLOUD BRIGHT AND FAIR BUT PASSING TRAILED LONG SHADOWS ON THE GROUND BLACK LIKE DESPAIR
868-131294-0005 AGAIN THE MODE WAS CHANGED PEIWOH SANG OF WAR OF CLASHING STEEL AND TRAMPLING STEEDS AND IN THE HARP AROSE THE TEMPEST OF LUNGMEN THE DRAGON RODE THE LIGHTNING THE THUNDERING AVALANCHE CRASHED THROUGH THE HILLS
868-131294-0006 IN ECSTASY THE CELESTIAL MONARCH ASKED PEIWOH WHEREIN LAY THE SECRET OF HIS VICTORY SIRE HE REPLIED OTHERS HAVE FAILED BECAUSE THEY SANG BUT OF THEMSELVES I LEFT THE HARP TO CHOOSE ITS THEME AND KNEW NOT TRULY WHETHER THE HARP HAD BEEN PEIWOH
868-131294-0007 AT THE MAGIC TOUCH OF THE BEAUTIFUL THE SECRET CHORDS OF OUR BEING ARE AWAKENED WE VIBRATE AND THRILL IN RESPONSE TO ITS CALL MIND SPEAKS TO MIND WE LISTEN TO THE UNSPOKEN WE GAZE UPON THE UNSEEN
868-131294-0008 HAS LEFT TO US THESE MEMORABLE WORDS APPROACH A GREAT PAINTING AS THOU WOULDST APPROACH A GREAT PRINCE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND A MASTERPIECE
868-131294-0009 AN EMINENT SUNG CRITIC ONCE MADE A CHARMING CONFESSION SAID HE IN MY YOUNG DAYS I PRAISED THE MASTER WHOSE PICTURES I LIKED BUT AS MY JUDGEMENT MATURED I PRAISED MYSELF FOR LIKING WHAT THE MASTERS HAD CHOSEN TO HAVE ME LIKE
868-131294-0010 IT IS TO BE DEPLORED THAT SO FEW OF US REALLY TAKE PAINS TO STUDY THE MOODS OF THE MASTERS IN OUR STUBBORN IGNORANCE WE REFUSE TO RENDER THEM THIS SIMPLE COURTESY
868-131294-0011 AND THUS OFTEN MISS THE RICH REPAST OF BEAUTY SPREAD BEFORE OUR VERY EYES A MASTER HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO OFFER WHILE WE GO HUNGRY SOLELY BECAUSE OF OUR OWN LACK OF APPRECIATION
868-131294-0012 THE MASTERS ARE IMMORTAL FOR THEIR LOVES AND FEARS LIVE IN US OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT IS RATHER THE SOUL THAN THE HAND
868-131294-0013 CHIKAMATSU OUR JAPANESE SHAKESPEARE HAS LAID DOWN AS ONE OF THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF DRAMATIC COMPOSITION THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING THE AUDIENCE INTO THE CONFIDENCE OF THE AUTHOR
868-131294-0014 SEVERAL OF HIS PUPILS SUBMITTED PLAYS FOR HIS APPROVAL BUT ONLY ONE OF THE PIECES APPEALED TO HIM IT WAS A PLAY SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING THE COMEDY OF ERRORS IN WHICH TWIN BRETHREN SUFFER THROUGH MISTAKEN IDENTITY
868-131294-0015 WHO CAN CONTEMPLATE A MASTERPIECE WITHOUT BEING AWED BY THE IMMENSE VISTA OF THOUGHT PRESENTED TO OUR CONSIDERATION HOW FAMILIAR AND SYMPATHETIC ARE THEY ALL HOW COLD IN CONTRAST THE MODERN COMMONPLACES
868-131294-0016 IN THE FORMER WE FEEL THE WARM OUTPOURING OF A MAN'S HEART IN THE LATTER ONLY A FORMAL SALUTE ENGROSSED IN HIS TECHNIQUE THE MODERN RARELY RISES ABOVE HIMSELF LIKE THE MUSICIANS WHO VAINLY INVOKED THE LUNGMEN HARP
868-131294-0017 HE SINGS ONLY OF HIMSELF HIS WORKS MAY BE NEARER SCIENCE BUT ARE FURTHER FROM HUMANITY WE HAVE AN OLD SAYING IN JAPAN THAT A WOMAN CANNOT LOVE A MAN WHO IS TRULY VAIN FOR THEIR IS NO CREVICE IN HIS HEART FOR LOVE TO ENTER AND FILL UP
868-131294-0018 IN ART VANITY IS EQUALLY FATAL TO SYMPATHETIC FEELING WHETHER ON THE PART OF THE ARTIST OR THE PUBLIC NOTHING IS MORE HALLOWING THAN THE UNION OF KINDRED SPIRITS IN ART
868-131294-0019 IN THE OLD DAYS THE VENERATION IN WHICH THE JAPANESE HELD THE WORK OF THE GREAT ARTIST WAS INTENSE THE TEA MASTERS GUARDED THEIR TREASURES WITH RELIGIOUS SECRECY AND IT WAS OFTEN NECESSARY TO OPEN A WHOLE SERIES OF BOXES
868-131294-0020 THE SILKEN WRAPPING WITHIN WHOSE SOFT FOLDS LAY THE HOLY OF HOLIES RARELY WAS THE OBJECT EXPOSED TO VIEW AND THEN ONLY TO THE INITIATED
868-131294-0021 SUDDENLY TAKES FIRE THROUGH THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE SAMURAI IN CHARGE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO RESCUE THE PRECIOUS PAINTING HE RUSHES INTO THE BURNING BUILDING AND SEIZES THE KAKEMONO ONLY TO FIND ALL MEANS OF EXIT CUT OFF BY THE FLAMES
868-131294-0022 THINKING ONLY OF THE PICTURE HE SLASHES OPEN HIS BODY WITH HIS SWORD WRAPS HIS TORN SLEEVE ABOUT THE SESSON AND PLUNGES IT INTO THE GAPING WOUND THE FIRE IS AT LAST EXTINGUISHED
868-131294-0023 WE MUST REMEMBER HOWEVER THAT ART IS OF VALUE ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT SPEAKS TO US IT MIGHT BE A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE IF WE OURSELVES WERE UNIVERSAL IN OUR SYMPATHIES OUR FINITE NATURE
868-131294-0024 THE POWER OF TRADITION AND CONVENTIONALITY AS WELL AS OUR HEREDITARY INSTINCTS RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF OUR CAPACITY FOR ARTISTIC ENJOYMENT OUR VERY INDIVIDUALITY ESTABLISHES IN ONE SENSE A LIMIT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING
868-131294-0025 AND OUR AESTHETIC PERSONALITY SEEKS ITS OWN AFFINITIES IN THE CREATIONS OF THE PAST IT IS TRUE THAT WITH CULTIVATION OUR SENSE OF ART APPRECIATION BROADENS AND WE BECOME ABLE TO ENJOY MANY HITHERTO UNRECOGNISED EXPRESSIONS OF BEAUTY
868-131294-0026 BUT AFTER ALL WE SEE ONLY OUR OWN IMAGE IN THE UNIVERSE OUR PARTICULAR IDIOSYNCRACIES DICTATE THE MODE OF OUR PERCEPTIONS THE TEA MASTERS COLLECTED ONLY OBJECTS WHICH FELL STRICTLY WITHIN THE MEASURE OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL APPRECIATION
868-131294-0027 ONE IS REMINDED IN THIS CONNECTION OF A STORY CONCERNING KOBORI ENSHIU ENSHIU WAS COMPLIMENTED BY HIS DISCIPLES ON THE ADMIRABLE TASTE HE HAD DISPLAYED IN THE CHOICE OF HIS COLLECTION SAID THEY
868-131294-0028 RIKIU WAS ONE IN A THOUSAND AMONG TEA MASTERS
868-131294-0029 REGARDLESS OF THEIR FEELINGS THEY WANT THE COSTLY NOT THE REFINED THE FASHIONABLE NOT THE BEAUTIFUL TO THE MASSES CONTEMPLATION OF ILLUSTRATED PERIODICALS THE WORTHY PRODUCT OF THEIR OWN INDUSTRIALISM
868-131294-0030 WOULD GIVE MORE DIGESTIBLE FOOD FOR ARTISTIC ENJOYMENT THAN THE EARLY ITALIANS OR THE ASHIKAGA MASTERS WHOM THEY PRETEND TO ADMIRE THE NAME OF THE ARTIST IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM THAN THE QUALITY OF THE WORK
868-131294-0031 AS A CHINESE CRITIC COMPLAINED MANY CENTURIES AGO PEOPLE CRITICISE A PICTURE BY THEIR EAR IT IS THIS LACK OF GENUINE APPRECIATION THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PSEUDO CLASSIC HORRORS THAT TO DAY GREET US WHEREVER WE TURN
868-131294-0032 YET WE ALLOW OUR HISTORICAL SYMPATHY TO OVERRIDE OUR AESTHETIC DISCRIMINATION WE OFFER FLOWERS OF APPROBATION WHEN THE ARTIST IS SAFELY LAID IN HIS GRAVE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY PREGNANT WITH THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION
868-131294-0033 HAS MOREOVER CREATED IN US THE HABIT OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE SPECIES A COLLECTOR IS ANXIOUS TO ACQUIRE SPECIMENS TO ILLUSTRATE A PERIOD OR A SCHOOL
868-131294-0034 THE SACRIFICE OF THE AESTHETIC TO THE SO CALLED SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF EXHIBITION HAS BEEN THE BANE OF MANY MUSEUMS THE CLAIMS OF CONTEMPORARY ART CANNOT BE IGNORED IN ANY VITAL SCHEME OF LIFE
868-131294-0035 THE ART OF TO DAY IS THAT WHICH REALLY BELONGS TO US IT IS OUR OWN REFLECTION IN CONDEMNING IT WE BUT CONDEMN OURSELVES WE SAY THAT THE PRESENT AGE POSSESSES NO ART
868-131294-0036 STRUGGLING ARTISTS WEARY SOULS LINGERING IN THE SHADOW OF COLD DISDAIN IN OUR SELF CENTERED CENTURY WHAT INSPIRATION DO WE OFFER THEM THE PAST MAY WELL LOOK WITH PITY AT THE POVERTY OF OUR CIVILISATION
