337-123025-0011 JUST AS WE WERE MOVING OFF A FOOTMAN CAME OUT WITH A SLIP OF PAPER
337-123025-0012 WOULD THEY ASK THIS QUESTION FOR HER AT DOCTOR ASHLEY'S AND BRING THE ANSWER THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT A MILE OFF AND THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE WAS THE LAST IN IT WE WENT ALONG GAYLY ENOUGH
337-123025-0013 TILL WE CAME TO HIS GATE THERE WAS A SHORT DRIVE UP TO THE HOUSE BETWEEN TALL EVERGREENS BLANTYRE ALIGHTED AT THE GATE AND WAS GOING TO OPEN IT FOR LADY ANNE BUT SHE SAID I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
337-123025-0014 AND WAS SOON HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES LIZZIE WAS STANDING QUIETLY BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A FEW PACES OFF WITH HER BACK TO ME MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS SITTING EASILY WITH A LOOSE REIN
337-123025-0015 HUMMING A LITTLE SONG I LISTENED TO MY RIDER'S FOOTSTEPS UNTIL THEY REACHED THE HOUSE AND HEARD HIM KNOCK AT THE DOOR THERE WAS A MEADOW ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE GATE OF WHICH STOOD OPEN
337-123025-0016 JUST THEN SOME CART HORSES AND SEVERAL YOUNG COLTS CAME TROTTING OUT IN A VERY DISORDERLY MANNER WHILE A BOY BEHIND WAS CRACKING A GREAT WHIP THE COLTS WERE WILD AND FROLICSOME
337-123025-0017 AND WHETHER IT WAS THE STUPID COLT OR THE LOUD CRACKING OF THE WHIP
337-123025-0018 BUT SHE GAVE A VIOLENT KICK AND DASHED OFF INTO A HEADLONG GALLOP IT WAS SO SUDDEN THAT LADY ANNE WAS NEARLY UNSEATED BUT SHE SOON RECOVERED HERSELF I GAVE A LOUD SHRILL NEIGH FOR HELP
337-123025-0019 AGAIN AND AGAIN I NEIGHED PAWING THE GROUND IMPATIENTLY AND TOSSING MY HEAD TO GET THE REIN LOOSE I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BLANTYRE CAME RUNNING TO THE GATE HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ABOUT
337-123025-0020 AND JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FLYING FIGURE NOW FAR AWAY ON THE ROAD IN AN INSTANT HE SPRANG TO THE SADDLE I NEEDED NO WHIP NO SPUR FOR I WAS AS EAGER AS MY RIDER
337-123025-0021 AND LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD WE DASHED AFTER THEM FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF THE ROAD RAN STRAIGHT AND THEN BENT TO THE RIGHT AFTER WHICH IT DIVIDED INTO TWO ROADS
337-123025-0022 LONG BEFORE WE CAME TO THE BEND SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH WAY HAD SHE TURNED A WOMAN WAS STANDING AT HER GARDEN GATE SHADING HER EYES WITH HER HAND AND LOOKING EAGERLY UP THE ROAD
337-123025-0023 SCARCELY DRAWING THE REIN BLANTYRE SHOUTED WHICH WAY TO THE RIGHT CRIED THE WOMAN POINTING WITH HER HAND AND AWAY WE WENT UP THE RIGHT HAND ROAD THEN FOR A MOMENT WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER
337-123025-0024 ANOTHER BEND AND SHE WAS HIDDEN AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES WE CAUGHT GLIMPSES AND THEN LOST THEM WE SCARCELY SEEMED TO GAIN GROUND UPON THEM AT ALL AN OLD ROAD MENDER WAS STANDING NEAR A HEAP OF STONES
337-123025-0025 HIS SHOVEL DROPPED AND HIS HANDS RAISED AS WE CAME NEAR HE MADE A SIGN TO SPEAK
337-123025-0026 TO THE COMMON TO THE COMMON SIR SHE HAS TURNED OFF THERE I KNEW THIS COMMON VERY WELL IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART VERY UNEVEN GROUND COVERED WITH HEATHER AND DARK GREEN FURZE BUSHES
337-123025-0027 THERE WERE ALSO OPEN SPACES OF FINE SHORT GRASS WITH ANT HILLS AND MOLE TURNS EVERYWHERE
337-123025-0028 WE HAD HARDLY TURNED ON THE COMMON WHEN WE CAUGHT SIGHT AGAIN OF THE GREEN HABIT FLYING ON BEFORE US MY LADY'S HAT WAS GONE AND HER LONG BROWN HAIR WAS STREAMING BEHIND HER HER HEAD AND BODY WERE THROWN BACK
337-123025-0029 BUT NOW WITH A LIGHT HAND AND A PRACTICED EYE HE GUIDED ME OVER THE GROUND IN SUCH A MASTERLY MANNER THAT MY PACE WAS SCARCELY SLACKENED AND WE WERE DECIDEDLY GAINING ON THEM
337-123025-0030 THERE HAD BEEN A WIDE DIKE RECENTLY CUT AND THE EARTH FROM THE CUTTING WAS CAST UP ROUGHLY ON THE OTHER SIDE SURELY THIS WOULD STOP THEM BUT NO WITH SCARCELY A PAUSE LIZZIE TOOK THE LEAP
337-123025-0031 AND WITH ONE DETERMINED LEAP CLEARED BOTH DIKE AND BANK MOTIONLESS AMONG THE HEATHER WITH HER FACE TO THE EARTH
337-123025-0032 THERE WAS NO SOUND GENTLY HE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD IT WAS GHASTLY WHITE AND THE EYES WERE CLOSED ANNIE DEAR ANNIE DO SPEAK BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER HE UNBUTTONED HER HABIT
337-123025-0033 LOOSENED HER COLLAR FELT HER HANDS AND WRIST THEN STARTED UP AND LOOKED WILDLY ROUND HIM FOR HELP AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE WERE TWO MEN CUTTING TURF WHO SEEING LIZZIE RUNNING WILD WITHOUT A RIDER
337-123025-0034 HAD LEFT THEIR WORK TO CATCH HER BLANTYRE'S HALLOO SOON BROUGHT THEM TO THE SPOT THE FOREMOST MAN SEEMED MUCH TROUBLED AT THE SIGHT AND ASKED WHAT HE COULD DO CAN YOU RIDE
337-123025-0035 SHE WAS UNCOMMON GOOD TO MY WIFE IN THE WINTER THEN MOUNT THIS HORSE MY FRIEND YOUR NECK WILL BE QUITE SAFE AND RIDE TO THE DOCTOR'S AND ASK HIM TO COME INSTANTLY
337-123025-0036 WITH LADY ANNE'S MAID AND HELP I SHALL STAY HERE ALL RIGHT SIR
337-123025-0037 MAY OPEN HER EYES SOON THEN SEEING THE OTHER MAN HE CALLED OUT HERE JOE RUN FOR SOME WATER AND TELL MY MISSIS
337-123025-0038 HE THEN SOMEHOW SCRAMBLED INTO THE SADDLE AND WITH A GEE UP AND A CLAP ON MY SIDES WITH BOTH HIS LEGS HE STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY MAKING A LITTLE CIRCUIT TO AVOID THE DIKE HE HAD NO WHIP WHICH SEEMED TO TROUBLE HIM
337-123025-0039 BUT MY PACE SOON CURED THAT DIFFICULTY AND HE FOUND THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO STICK TO THE SADDLE AND HOLD ME IN WHICH HE DID MANFULLY I SHOOK HIM AS LITTLE AS I COULD HELP BUT ONCE OR TWICE
337-123025-0040 STEADY WOAH STEADY ON THE HIGHROAD WE WERE ALL RIGHT AND AT THE DOCTOR'S AND THE HALL HE DID HIS ERRAND LIKE A GOOD MAN AND TRUE THEY ASKED HIM IN TO TAKE A DROP OF SOMETHING
337-123025-0041 NO NO HE SAID I'LL BE BACK TO EM AGAIN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE FIELDS
337-123025-0042 THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE WERE TAKEN OFF AND A CLOTH THROWN OVER ME GINGER WAS SADDLED AND SENT OFF IN GREAT HASTE FOR LORD GEORGE AND I SOON HEARD THE CARRIAGE ROLL OUT OF THE YARD
337-123025-0043 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE GINGER CAME BACK AND BEFORE WE WERE LEFT ALONE AND THEN SHE TOLD ME ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN I CAN'T TELL MUCH SHE SAID WE WENT A GALLOP NEARLY ALL THE WAY
337-123025-0044 AND GOT THERE JUST AS THE DOCTOR RODE UP THERE WAS A WOMAN SITTING ON THE GROUND WITH THE LADY'S HEAD IN HER LAP THE DOCTOR POURED SOMETHING INTO HER MOUTH BUT ALL THAT I HEARD WAS SHE IS NOT DEAD THEN I WAS LED OFF BY A MAN
337-123025-0045 TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AFTER AWHILE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CARRIAGE AND WE CAME HOME TOGETHER I HEARD MY MASTER SAY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO STOPPED HIM TO INQUIRE THAT HE HOPED NO BONES WERE BROKEN BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN YET
337-123025-0046 WHEN LORD GEORGE TOOK GINGER FOR HUNTING YORK SHOOK HIS HEAD HE SAID IT OUGHT TO BE A STEADY HAND TO TRAIN A HORSE FOR THE FIRST SEASON AND NOT A RANDOM RIDER LIKE LORD GEORGE GINGER USED TO LIKE IT VERY MUCH
337-123025-0047 BUT SOMETIMES WHEN SHE CAME BACK I COULD SEE THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH STRAINED AND NOW AND THEN SHE GAVE A SHORT COUGH SHE HAD TOO MUCH SPIRIT TO COMPLAIN BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
337-123025-0048 TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BLANTYRE PAID ME A VISIT HE PATTED ME AND PRAISED ME VERY MUCH HE TOLD LORD GEORGE THAT HE WAS SURE THE HORSE KNEW OF ANNIE'S DANGER AS WELL AS HE DID
337-123025-0049 I FOUND BY THEIR CONVERSATION THAT MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS NOW OUT OF DANGER AND WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO RIDE AGAIN
