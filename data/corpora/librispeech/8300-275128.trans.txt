8300-275128-0000 THEY WERE ALL ASSEMBLED AS USUAL AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE PREFERRING THE REQUEST SUGGESTED TO HER BY MISSUS PRESTY KITTY HAD HASTENED THE PRESENTATION OF THE BIRTHDAY GIFTS BY GETTING INTO HER MOTHER'S BED IN THE MORNING
8300-275128-0001 AND EXACTING HER MOTHER'S PROMISE BEFORE SHE WOULD CONSENT TO GET OUT AGAIN BY HER OWN EXPRESS WISH SHE WAS LEFT IN IGNORANCE OF WHAT THE PRESENTS WOULD PROVE TO BE
8300-275128-0002 HIDE THEM FROM ME SAID THIS YOUNG EPICURE IN PLEASURABLE SENSATIONS AND MAKE ME WANT TO SEE THEM UNTIL I CAN BEAR IT NO LONGER THE GIFTS HAD ACCORDINGLY BEEN COLLECTED IN AN EMBRASURE
8300-275128-0003 OF ONE OF THE WINDOWS AND THE TIME HAD NOW ARRIVED WHEN KITTY COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER IN THE PROCESSION OF THE PRESENTS MISSUS LINLEY LED THE WAY
8300-275128-0004 SHE HAD PASSED BEHIND THE SCREEN WHICH HAD THUS FAR PROTECTED THE HIDDEN TREASURES FROM DISCOVERY AND APPEARED AGAIN WITH A VISION OF BEAUTY IN THE SHAPE OF A DOLL
8300-275128-0005 THE DRESS OF THIS WONDERFUL CREATURE EXHIBITED THE LATEST AUDACITIES OF FRENCH FASHION HER HEAD MADE A BOW HER EYES WENT TO SLEEP AND WOKE AGAIN
8300-275128-0006 SHE HAD A VOICE THAT SAID TWO WORDS MORE PRECIOUS THAN TWO THOUSAND IN THE MOUTH OF A MERE LIVING CREATURE KITTY'S ARMS OPENED AND EMBRACED HER GIFT WITH A SCREAM OF ECSTASY
8300-275128-0007 THAT FERVENT PRESSURE FOUND ITS WAY TO THE RIGHT SPRING THE DOLL SQUEAKED MAMMA AND CREAKED AND CRIED AGAIN AND SAID PAPA
8300-275128-0008 KITTY SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR HER LEGS WOULD SUPPORT HER NO LONGER I THINK I SHALL FAINT SHE SAID QUITE SERIOUSLY IN THE MIDST OF THE GENERAL LAUGHTER SYDNEY SILENTLY PLACED A NEW TOY
8300-275128-0009 A PRETTY LITTLE IMITATION OF A JEWELER'S CASKET AT KITTY'S SIDE AND DREW BACK BEFORE THE CHILD COULD LOOK AT HER MISSUS PRESTY WAS THE ONLY PERSON PRESENT WHO NOTICED HER PALE FACE
8300-275128-0010 AND THE TREMBLING OF HER HANDS AS SHE MADE THE EFFORT WHICH PRESERVED HER COMPOSURE THE DOLL'S NECKLACE BRACELETS AND WATCH AND CHAIN RIVETED KITTY'S ATTENTION ON THE CASKET
8300-275128-0011 JUST AS SHE THOUGHT OF LOOKING ROUND FOR HER DEAR SYD HER FATHER PRODUCED A NEW OUTBURST OF DELIGHT BY PRESENTING A PERAMBULATOR WORTHY OF THE DOLL
8300-275128-0012 HER UNCLE FOLLOWED WITH A PARASOL DEVOTED TO THE PRESERVATION OF THE DOLL'S COMPLEXION WHEN SHE WENT OUT FOR AN AIRING THEN THERE CAME A PAUSE
8300-275128-0013 WHERE WAS THE GENEROUS GRANDMOTHER'S GIFT NOBODY REMEMBERED IT MISSUS PRESTY HERSELF DISCOVERED THE INESTIMABLE SIXPENNY PICTURE BOOK CAST AWAY AND FORGOTTEN ON A DISTANT WINDOW SEAT
8300-275128-0014 I HAVE A GREAT MIND TO KEEP THIS SHE SAID TO KITTY TILL YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO VALUE IT PROPERLY
8300-275128-0015 IN THE MOMENT OF HER ABSENCE AT THE WINDOW LINLEY'S MOTHER IN LAW LOST THE CHANCE OF SEEING HIM WHISPER TO SYDNEY MEET ME IN THE SHRUBBERY IN HALF AN HOUR HE SAID SHE STEPPED BACK FROM HIM STARTLED BY THE PROPOSAL
8300-275128-0016 HAVING BY THIS TIME RECOVERED HERSELF KITTY GOT ON HER LEGS NOW THE SPOILED CHILD DECLARED ADDRESSING THE COMPANY PRESENT I'M GOING TO PLAY
8300-275128-0017 THE DOLL WAS PUT INTO THE PERAMBULATOR AND WAS WHEELED ABOUT THE ROOM WHILE MISSUS LINLEY MOVED THE CHAIRS OUT OF THE WAY AND RANDAL ATTENDED WITH THE OPEN PARASOL UNDER ORDERS TO PRETEND THAT THE SUN WAS SHINING
8300-275128-0018 MISSUS PRESTY PICKED IT UP FROM THE FLOOR DETERMINED BY THIS TIME TO HOLD IT
8300-275128-0019 IN THE POSITION WHICH SHE NOW OCCUPIED LINLEY WAS VISIBLE APPROACHING SYDNEY AGAIN YOUR OWN INTERESTS ARE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED HE WHISPERED IN SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU
8300-275128-0020 INCAPABLE OF HEARING WHAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM MISSUS PRESTY COULD SEE THAT A SECRET UNDERSTANDING UNITED HER SON IN LAW AND THE GOVERNESS SHE LOOKED ROUND CAUTIOUSLY AT MISSUS LINLEY
8300-275128-0021 KITTY'S HUMOR HAD CHANGED SHE WAS NOW EAGER TO SEE THE DOLL'S SPLENDID CLOTHES TAKEN OFF AND PUT ON AGAIN COME AND LOOK AT IT SHE SAID TO SYDNEY I WANT YOU TO ENJOY MY BIRTHDAY AS MUCH AS I DO
8300-275128-0022 LEFT BY HIMSELF RANDAL GOT RID OF THE PARASOL BY PUTTING IT ON A TABLE NEAR THE DOOR MISSUS PRESTY BECKONED TO HIM TO JOIN HER AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR SHE BEGAN
8300-275128-0023 GLANCING AT LINLEY BEFORE SHE PROCEEDED MISSUS PRESTY TOOK UP A NEWSPAPER AND AFFECTED TO BE CONSULTING RANDAL'S OPINION ON A PASSAGE WHICH HAD ATTRACTED HER ATTENTION
8300-275128-0024 YOUR BROTHER IS LOOKING OUR WAY SHE WHISPERED HE MUSTN'T SUSPECT THAT THERE IS A SECRET BETWEEN US FALSE PRETENSES OF ANY KIND INVARIABLY IRRITATED RANDAL WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO HE ASKED SHARPLY
8300-275128-0025 THE REPLY ONLY INCREASED HIS PERPLEXITY OBSERVE MISS WESTERFIELD AND YOUR BROTHER LOOK AT THEM NOW RANDAL OBEYED WHAT IS THERE TO LOOK AT HE INQUIRED CAN'T YOU SEE
8300-275128-0026 I SEE THEY ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER THEY ARE TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY TALKING SO THAT MISSUS LINLEY CAN'T HEAR THEM LOOK AGAIN
8300-275128-0027 WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SHOWED HIS DISLIKE OF THAT LADY A LITTLE TOO PLAINLY BEFORE HE COULD ANSWER WHAT SHE HAD JUST SAID TO HIM HIS LIVELY LITTLE NIECE HIT ON A NEW IDEA
8300-275128-0028 THE SUN WAS SHINING THE FLOWERS WERE IN THEIR BRIGHTEST BEAUTY AND THE DOLL HAD NOT YET BEEN TAKEN INTO THE GARDEN KITTY AT ONCE LED THE WAY OUT SO COMPLETELY PREOCCUPIED
8300-275128-0029 IN STEERING THE PERAMBULATOR IN A STRAIGHT COURSE THAT SHE FORGOT HER UNCLE AND THE PARASOL ONLY WAITING TO REMIND HER HUSBAND AND SYDNEY THAT THEY WERE WASTING THE BEAUTIFUL SUMMER MORNING INDOORS
8300-275128-0030 MISSUS LINLEY FOLLOWED HER DAUGHTER AND INNOCENTLY PLACED A FATAL OBSTACLE IN MISSUS PRESTY'S WAY BY LEAVING THE ROOM
8300-275128-0031 HAVING CONSULTED EACH OTHER BY A LOOK LINLEY AND THE GOVERNESS WENT OUT NEXT LEFT ALONE WITH RANDAL MISSUS PRESTY'S ANGER UNDER THE COMPLETE OVERTHROW OF HER CAREFULLY LAID SCHEME
8300-275128-0032 SET RESTRAINT AT DEFIANCE MY DAUGHTER'S MARRIED LIFE IS A WRECK SHE BURST OUT POINTING THEATRICALLY TO THE DOOR BY WHICH LINLEY AND SYDNEY WESTERFIELD HAD RETIRED
8300-275128-0033 AND CATHERINE HAS THE VILE CREATURE WHOM YOUR BROTHER PICKED UP IN LONDON TO THANK FOR IT NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME LESS THAN EVER RANDAL ANSWERED UNLESS YOU HAVE TAKEN LEAVE OF YOUR SENSES
8300-275128-0034 MISSUS PRESTY RECOVERED THE COMMAND OF HER TEMPER ON THAT FINE MORNING HER DAUGHTER MIGHT REMAIN IN THE GARDEN UNTIL THE LUNCHEON BELL RANG LINLEY HAD ONLY TO SAY THAT HE WISHED TO SPEAK WITH HIS WIFE
8300-275128-0035 AND THE PRIVATE INTERVIEW WHICH HE HAD SO RUDELY INSISTED ON AS HIS SOLE PRIVILEGE WOULD ASSUREDLY TAKE PLACE THE ONE CHANCE LEFT OF STILL DEFEATING HIM ON HIS OWN GROUND
8300-275128-0036 WAS TO FORCE RANDAL TO INTERFERE BY CONVINCING HIM OF HIS BROTHER'S GUILT MODERATION OF LANGUAGE AND COMPOSURE OF MANNER OFFERED THE ONLY HOPEFUL PROSPECT OF REACHING THIS END
8300-275128-0037 MISSUS PRESTY ASSUMED THE DISGUISE OF PATIENT SUBMISSION AND USED THE IRRESISTIBLE INFLUENCE OF GOOD HUMOR AND GOOD SENSE I DON'T COMPLAIN DEAR RANDAL OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID TO ME SHE REPLIED
8300-275128-0038 MY INDISCRETION HAS DESERVED IT I OUGHT TO HAVE PRODUCED MY PROOFS AND HAVE LEFT IT TO YOU TO DRAW THE CONCLUSION SIT DOWN IF YOU PLEASE I WON'T DETAIN YOU FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES
8300-275128-0039 RANDAL HAD NOT ANTICIPATED SUCH MODERATION AS THIS HE TOOK THE CHAIR THAT WAS NEAREST TO MISSUS PRESTY THEY WERE BOTH NOW SITTING WITH THEIR BACKS TURNED TO THE ENTRANCE FROM THE LIBRARY TO THE DRAWING ROOM
8300-275128-0040 I WON'T TROUBLE YOU WITH MY OWN IMPRESSIONS MISSUS PRESTY WENT ON I WILL BE CAREFUL ONLY TO MENTION WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD IF YOU REFUSE TO BELIEVE ME I REFER YOU TO THE GUILTY PERSONS THEMSELVES
8300-275128-0041 SHE HAD JUST GOT TO THE END OF THOSE INTRODUCTORY WORDS WHEN MISSUS LINLEY RETURNED BY WAY OF THE LIBRARY TO FETCH THE FORGOTTEN PARASOL RANDAL INSISTED ON MAKING MISSUS PRESTY EXPRESS HERSELF PLAINLY
8300-275128-0042 YOU SPEAK OF GUILTY PERSONS HE SAID AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THOSE GUILTY PERSONS IS MY BROTHER MISSUS LINLEY ADVANCED A STEP AND TOOK THE PARASOL FROM THE TABLE
8300-275128-0043 HEARING WHAT RANDAL SAID SHE PAUSED WONDERING AT THE STRANGE ALLUSION TO HER HUSBAND IN THE MEANWHILE MISSUS PRESTY ANSWERED THE QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN ADDRESSED TO HER YES SHE SAID TO RANDAL
8300-275128-0044 I MEAN YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR BROTHER'S MISTRESS SYDNEY WESTERFIELD MISSUS LINLEY LAID THE PARASOL BACK ON THE TABLE AND APPROACHED THEM SHE NEVER ONCE LOOKED AT HER MOTHER
8300-275128-0045 HER FACE WHITE AND RIGID WAS TURNED TOWARD RANDAL TO HIM AND TO HIM ONLY SHE SPOKE WHAT DOES MY MOTHER'S HORRIBLE LANGUAGE MEAN SHE ASKED
8300-275128-0046 CHANCE HAD DECIDED IN HER FAVOR AFTER ALL DON'T YOU SEE SHE SAID TO HER DAUGHTER THAT I AM HERE TO ANSWER FOR MYSELF MISSUS LINLEY STILL LOOKED AT RANDAL AND STILL SPOKE TO HIM
8300-275128-0047 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO INSIST ON AN EXPLANATION FROM MY MOTHER SHE PROCEEDED NO MATTER WHAT I MAY FEEL I MUST REMEMBER THAT SHE IS MY MOTHER I ASK YOU AGAIN
8300-275128-0048 YOU WHO HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO HER WHAT DOES SHE MEAN MISSUS PRESTY'S SENSE OF HER OWN IMPORTANCE REFUSED TO SUBMIT TO BEING PASSED OVER IN THIS WAY
8300-275128-0049 HOWEVER INSOLENTLY YOU MAY BEHAVE CATHERINE YOU WILL NOT SUCCEED IN PROVOKING ME YOUR MOTHER IS BOUND TO OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE TRUTH YOU HAVE A RIVAL IN YOUR HUSBAND'S AFFECTIONS
8300-275128-0050 AND THAT RIVAL IS YOUR GOVERNESS TAKE YOUR OWN COURSE NOW I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY WITH HER HEAD HIGH IN THE AIR LOOKING THE PICTURE OF CONSCIOUS VIRTUE THE OLD LADY WALKED OUT
8300-275128-0051 AT THE SAME MOMENT RANDAL SEIZED HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING
8300-275128-0052 THE INDIGNATION WHICH MISSUS PRESTY HAD ROUSED IN HER MADE NO ALLOWANCES AND WAS BLIND TO ALL SENSE OF RIGHT DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF TO ACCOUNT FOR YOUR SILENCE SHE SAID MOST UNJUSTLY
8300-275128-0053 YOU WERE LISTENING TO MY MOTHER WITHOUT A WORD OF REMONSTRANCE WHEN I CAME INTO THE ROOM YOU ARE CONCERNED IN THIS VILE SLANDER TOO RANDAL CONSIDERATELY REFRAINED FROM PROVOKING HER
8300-275128-0054 BY ATTEMPTING TO DEFEND HIMSELF WHILE SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING HIM YOU WILL BE SORRY WHEN YOU FIND THAT YOU HAVE MISJUDGED ME HE SAID AND SIGHED AND LEFT HER
8300-275128-0055 SHE DROPPED INTO A CHAIR IF THERE WAS ANY ONE DISTINCT THOUGHT IN HER AT THAT MOMENT IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF HER HUSBAND SHE WAS EAGER TO SEE HIM SHE LONGED TO SAY TO HIM
8300-275128-0056 MY LOVE I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT HE WAS NOT IN THE GARDEN WHEN SHE HAD RETURNED FOR THE PARASOL AND SYDNEY WAS NOT IN THE GARDEN
8300-275128-0057 WONDERING WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER FATHER AND HER GOVERNESS KITTY HAD ASKED THE NURSEMAID TO LOOK FOR THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE WHERE HAD THEY BEEN FOUND AFTER SOME HESITATION MISSUS LINLEY SENT FOR THE NURSEMAID
8300-275128-0058 SHE FELT THE STRONGEST RELUCTANCE WHEN THE GIRL APPEARED TO APPROACH THE VERY INQUIRIES WHICH SHE WAS INTERESTED IN MAKING HAVE YOU FOUND MISTER LINLEY SHE SAID WITH AN EFFORT
8300-275128-0059 YES MA'AM WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM IN THE SHRUBBERY DID YOUR MASTER SAY ANYTHING I SLIPPED AWAY MA'AM BEFORE HE SAW ME WHY MISS WESTERFIELD WAS IN THE SHRUBBERY WITH MY MASTER
8300-275128-0060 I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THE GIRL PAUSED AND LOOKED CONFUSED MISSUS LINLEY TRIED TO TELL HER TO GO ON THE WORDS WERE IN HER MIND BUT THE CAPACITY OF GIVING EXPRESSION TO THEM FAILED HER
8300-275128-0061 SHE IMPATIENTLY MADE A SIGN THE SIGN WAS UNDERSTOOD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THE MAID REPEATED BUT I THOUGHT MISS WESTERFIELD WAS CRYING
8300-275128-0062 HAVING REPLIED IN THOSE TERMS SHE SEEMED TO BE ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY THE PARASOL CAUGHT HER EYE MISS KITTY WANTS THIS SHE SAID AND WONDERS WHY YOU HAVE NOT GONE BACK TO HER IN THE GARDEN MAY I TAKE THE PARASOL
8300-275128-0063 TAKE IT THE TONE OF THE MISTRESS'S VOICE WAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE SERVANT LOOKED AT HER WITH VAGUE MISGIVINGS ARE YOU NOT WELL MA'AM QUITE WELL THE SERVANT WITHDREW
8300-275128-0064 MISSUS LINLEY'S CHAIR HAPPENED TO BE NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS WHICH COMMANDED A VIEW OF THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE HOUSE A CARRIAGE HAD JUST ARRIVED BRINGING HOLIDAY TRAVELERS TO VISIT
8300-275128-0065 THAT PART OF MOUNT MORVEN WHICH WAS OPEN TO STRANGERS SHE WATCHED THEM AS THEY GOT OUT TALKING AND LAUGHING AND LOOKING ABOUT THEM
8300-275128-0066 STILL SHRINKING INSTINCTIVELY FROM THE FIRST DOUBT OF HERBERT THAT HAD EVER ENTERED HER MIND SHE FOUND A REFUGE FROM HERSELF IN WATCHING THE ORDINARY EVENTS OF THE DAY
8300-275128-0067 ONE BY ONE THE TOURISTS DISAPPEARED UNDER THE PORTICO OF THE FRONT DOOR THE EMPTY CARRIAGE WAS DRIVEN AWAY NEXT TO WATER THE HORSES AT THE VILLAGE INN SOLITUDE WAS ALL SHE COULD SEE FROM THE WINDOWS
8300-275128-0068 SILENCE HORRIBLE SILENCE SURROUNDED HER OUT OF DOORS AND IN THE THOUGHTS FROM WHICH SHE RECOILED FORCED THEIR WAY BACK INTO HER MIND THE NARRATIVE OF THE NURSEMAID'S DISCOVERY BECAME A BURDEN ON HER MEMORY
8300-275128-0069 ONCE MORE SHE CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN SPITE OF HERSELF SHE CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES AGAIN HER HUSBAND AND SYDNEY WESTERFIELD TOGETHER IN THE SHRUBBERY AND SYDNEY CRYING
8300-275128-0070 HAD MISSUS PRESTY'S ABOMINABLE SUSPICION OF THEM REACHED THEIR EARS OR NO THAT SECOND POSSIBILITY MIGHT BE ESTIMATED AT ITS RIGHT VALUE BY ANY OTHER WOMAN
8300-275128-0071 NOT BY HERBERT LINLEY'S WIFE SHE SNATCHED UP THE NEWSPAPER AND FIXED HER EYES ON IT IN THE HOPE OF FIXING HER MIND ON IT NEXT OBSTINATELY DESPERATELY SHE READ WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS READING
8300-275128-0072 THE LINES OF PRINT WERE BEGINNING TO MINGLE AND GROW DIM WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN OPENING OF THE DOOR
