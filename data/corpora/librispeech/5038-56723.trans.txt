5038-56723-0000 OF CONSTANCY THE LAW OF RESOLUTION AND CONSTANCY DOES NOT IMPLY THAT WE OUGHT NOT AS MUCH AS IN US LIES
5038-56723-0001 TO DECLINE AND SECURE OURSELVES FROM THE MISCHIEFS AND INCONVENIENCES THAT THREATEN US NOR CONSEQUENTLY THAT WE SHALL NOT FEAR LEST THEY SHOULD SURPRISE US
5038-56723-0002 ON THE CONTRARY ALL
5038-56723-0003 AND MEANS OF SECURING OURSELVES FROM HARMS ARE NOT ONLY PERMITTED BUT MOREOVER COMMENDABLE AND THE BUSINESS OF CONSTANCY CHIEFLY IS BRAVELY TO STAND TO AND STOUTLY TO SUFFER
5038-56723-0004 THOSE INCONVENIENCES WHICH ARE NOT POSSIBLY TO BE AVOIDED SO THAT THERE IS NO SUPPLE MOTION OF BODY NOR ANY MOVEMENT IN THE HANDLING OF ARMS HOW IRREGULAR OR UNGRACEFUL
5038-56723-0005 SOEVER THAT WE NEED CONDEMN IF THEY SERVE TO PROTECT US FROM THE BLOW THAT IS MADE AGAINST US SEVERAL
5038-56723-0006 A THING OF SINGULAR ADVANTAGE
5038-56723-0007 THEN BE A REPUTED COWARDICE TO OVERCOME THEM BY GIVING GROUND URGING AT THE SAME TIME THE AUTHORITY OF HOMER WHO COMMENDS IN A ENEAS THE SCIENCE OF
5038-56723-0008 FLIGHT AND WHEREAS LACHES CONSIDERING BETTER OF IT ADMITS THE PRACTICE AS TO THE SCYTHIANS AND IN GENERAL ALL CAVALRY WHATEVER
5038-56723-0009 HE AGAIN ATTACKS HIM WITH THE EXAMPLE OF THE
5038-56723-0010 THE MOST OBSTINATE IN MAINTAINING THEIR GROUND
5038-56723-0011 PLATAEA NOT BEING ABLE TO BREAK INTO THE PERSIAN PHALANX BETHOUGHT THEMSELVES TO DISPERSE AND RETIRE THAT BY THE ENEMY SUPPOSING THEY FLED
5038-56723-0012 THEY MIGHT BREAK AND DISUNITE THAT VAST BODY OF MEN IN THE PURSUIT
5038-56723-0013 AS FOR THE SCYTHIANS TIS SAID OF THEM THAT WHEN DARIUS WENT HIS EXPEDITION TO SUBDUE THEM HE SENT BY A HERALD HIGHLY TO REPROACH THEIR KING
5038-56723-0014 AND THERE HE SHOULD HAVE HIS FILL NEVERTHELESS AS TO CANNON SHOT WHEN A BODY OF MEN ARE DRAWN UP IN THE FACE
5038-56723-0015 OF A TRAIN OF ARTILLERY AS THE OCCASION OF WAR OFTEN REQUIRES IT IS UNHANDSOME TO QUIT THEIR POST TO AVOID THE DANGER
5038-56723-0016 AND MANY A ONE BY DUCKING STEPPING ASIDE AND SUCH OTHER MOTIONS OF FEAR HAS BEEN AT ALL EVENTS SUFFICIENTLY LAUGHED AT BY HIS COMPANIONS AND YET
5038-56723-0017 IN THE EXPEDITION THAT THE EMPEROR CHARLES
5038-56723-0018 AGAINST US INTO PROVENCE
5038-56723-0019 GOING TO RECONNOITRE THE CITY OF ARLES AND ADVANCING OUT OF THE COVER OF A WINDMILL UNDER FAVOUR OF WHICH HE HAD MADE HIS APPROACH WAS PERCEIVED BY THE
5038-56723-0020 BONNEVAL AND THE SENESCHAL OF
5038-56723-0021 WHO HAVING SHOWN HIM TO THE SIEUR DE VILLIERS
5038-56723-0022 THAT HAD NOT THE MARQUIS SEEING FIRE GIVEN TO IT
5038-56723-0023 LAYING SIEGE TO MONDOLFO A PLACE IN THE TERRITORIES OF THE VICARIAT IN ITALY SEEING THE CANNONEER GIVE FIRE TO A PIECE THAT POINTED DIRECTLY AGAINST HIM
5038-56723-0024 IT WAS WELL FOR HIM THAT HE DUCKED FOR OTHERWISE THE SHOT THAT ONLY RAZED THE TOP OF HIS HEAD HAD DOUBTLESS HIT HIM FULL IN THE BREAST TO SAY TRUTH I DO NOT THINK
5038-56723-0025 THAT THESE EVASIONS ARE PERFORMED UPON THE ACCOUNT OF JUDGMENT FOR HOW CAN ANY MAN LIVING JUDGE OF HIGH OR LOW AIM ON SO SUDDEN AN OCCASION
5038-56723-0026 AND IT IS MUCH MORE EASY TO BELIEVE THAT FORTUNE FAVOURED THEIR APPREHENSION AND THAT IT MIGHT BE AS WELL AT ANOTHER TIME TO MAKE THEM FACE THE DANGER
5038-56723-0027 AS TO SEEK TO AVOID IT FOR MY OWN PART I CONFESS I CANNOT FORBEAR STARTING WHEN THE
5038-56723-0028 AND THAT THE SEAT OF HIS REASON SUFFER NO CONCUSSION NOR ALTERATION AND THAT HE YIELD NO CONSENT TO HIS FRIGHT AND DISCOMPOSURE TO HIM WHO IS NOT A PHILOSOPHER A FRIGHT
5038-56723-0029 IS THE SAME THING IN THE FIRST PART OF IT BUT QUITE ANOTHER THING IN THE SECOND FOR THE IMPRESSION OF PASSIONS DOES NOT REMAIN SUPERFICIALLY IN HIM BUT PENETRATES FARTHER
5038-56723-0030 EVEN TO THE VERY SEAT OF REASON INFECTING AND CORRUPTING IT
5038-56723-0031 THE WISE STOIC LEARNEDLY AND PLAINLY EXPRESSED MENS IMMOTA MANET
5038-56723-0032 VOLVUNTUR INANES THOUGH TEARS FLOW THE MIND REMAINS UNMOVED VIRGIL A ENEID
