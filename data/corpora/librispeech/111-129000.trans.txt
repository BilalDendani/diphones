111-129000-0000 HE OBEYED THE ORDERS OF HIS USURPING PARTNER BECAUSE HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO SO BUT HE DID NOT HATE BLACKBEARD ANY THE LESS BECAUSE HE HAD TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT IT HE ACCOMPANIED HIS PIRATE CHIEF ON VARIOUS CRUISES
111-129000-0001 AMONG WHICH WAS THE FAMOUS EXPEDITION TO THE HARBOR OF CHARLES TOWN WHERE BLACKBEARD TRADED MISTER WRAGG AND HIS COMPANIONS
111-129000-0002 HAVING A VERY FINE FLEET UNDER HIM BLACKBEARD DID A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS FOR SOME TIME BUT FEELING THAT HE HAD EARNED ENOUGH FOR THE PRESENT AND THAT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO TAKE ONE OF HIS VACATIONS
111-129000-0003 HE PUT INTO AN INLET IN NORTH CAROLINA WHERE HE DISBANDED HIS CREW SO LONG AS HE WAS ON SHORE SPENDING HIS MONEY AND HAVING A GOOD TIME HE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF MEN ABOUT HIM WHO WOULD LOOK TO HIM TO SUPPORT THEM
111-129000-0004 WHEN THEY HAD SPENT THEIR PORTION OF THE SPOILS HAVING NO FURTHER USE FOR BONNET HE DISMISSED HIM ALSO AND DID NOT OBJECT TO HIS RESUMING POSSESSION OF HIS OWN VESSEL
111-129000-0005 IF THE GREEN PIRATE CHOSE TO GO TO SEA AGAIN AND PERHAPS DROWN HIMSELF AND HIS CREW IT WAS A MATTER OF NO CONCERN TO BLACKBEARD BUT THIS WAS A MATTER OF VERY GREAT CONCERN TO STEDE BONNET
111-129000-0006 AND HE PROCEEDED TO PROVE THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN BRANCHES OF THE PIRATICAL BUSINESS
111-129000-0007 HE WISHED TO GO PIRATING AGAIN AND SAW A WAY OF DOING THIS WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD BE FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY OF THE COMMON METHODS IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT KING GEORGE OF ENGLAND
111-129000-0008 VERY DESIROUS OF BREAKING UP PIRACY ISSUED A PROCLAMATION IN WHICH HE PROMISED PARDON TO ANY PIRATE WHO WOULD APPEAR BEFORE THE PROPER AUTHORITIES RENOUNCE HIS EVIL PRACTICES AND TAKE AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE
111-129000-0009 IT ALSO HAPPENED THAT VERY SOON AFTER THIS PROCLAMATION HAD BEEN ISSUED ENGLAND WENT TO WAR WITH SPAIN BEING A MAN WHO KEPT HIMSELF POSTED IN THE NEWS OF THE WORLD SO FAR AS IT WAS POSSIBLE
111-129000-0010 BONNET SAW IN THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS A VERY GOOD CHANCE FOR HIM TO PLAY THE PART OF A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING
111-129000-0011 PIRATICAL CAREER BY RENOUNCING PIRACY
111-129000-0012 TOOK OATHS AND DID EVERYTHING THAT WAS NECESSARY TO CHANGE HIMSELF FROM A PIRATE CAPTAIN TO A RESPECTABLE COMMANDER
111-129000-0013 HE WAS A LOYAL AND LAW ABIDING SUBJECT OF GREAT BRITAIN
111-129000-0014 FOR SAINT THOMAS WHICH WAS A BRITISH NAVAL STATION AND WHERE HE DECLARED HE WAS GOING IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A COMMISSION AS A PRIVATEER NOW THE WILY
111-129000-0015 OF COURSE IT WOULD NOT DO FOR HIM IN HIS PRESENT RESPECTABLE CAPACITY TO GO ABOUT ENLISTING UNEMPLOYED PIRATES BUT AT THIS POINT FORTUNE AGAIN FAVORED HIM
111-129000-0016 HE KNEW OF A DESERT ISLAND NOT VERY FAR AWAY WHERE BLACKBEARD AT THE END OF HIS LAST CRUISE HAD MAROONED A LARGE PARTY OF HIS MEN THIS HEARTLESS PIRATE HAD NOT WANTED TO TAKE ALL OF HIS FOLLOWERS INTO PORT
111-129000-0017 TO LIVE OR DIE AS THE CASE MIGHT BE BONNET WENT OVER TO THIS ISLAND AND FINDING THE GREATER PART OF THESE MEN STILL SURVIVING HE OFFERED TO TAKE THEM TO SAINT THOMAS IN HIS VESSEL IF THEY WOULD AGREE TO WORK
111-129000-0018 THE SHIP TO PORT THIS PROPOSITION WAS OF COURSE JOYFULLY ACCEPTED AND VERY SOON THE REVENGE WAS MANNED WITH A COMPLETE CREW OF COMPETENT DESPERADOES
111-129000-0019 AND AT LAST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR BONNET TO START OUT ON HIS PIRATICAL CRUISE HE RECEIVED INFORMATION WHICH CAUSED HIM TO CHANGE HIS MIND
111-129000-0020 WHOM HE HAD NEVER FORGIVEN FOR THE SHAMEFUL AND TREACHEROUS MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD TREATED HIM WAS STILL ON SHORE ENJOYING HIMSELF BUT HE WAS TOLD BY THE CAPTAIN OF A SMALL TRADING VESSEL THAT THE OLD PIRATE WAS PREPARING FOR ANOTHER CRUISE
111-129000-0021 AND THAT HE WAS THEN IN OCRACOKE INLET NOW BONNET FOLDED HIS ARMS AND STAMPED HIS FEET UPON THE QUARTER DECK THE TIME HAD COME FOR HIM TO SHOW THAT THE NAME OF HIS VESSEL MEANT SOMETHING
111-129000-0022 NEVER BEFORE HAD HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENGING HIMSELF ON ANYBODY BUT NOW THAT HOUR HAD ARRIVED HE WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF UPON BLACKBEARD THE IMPLACABLE BONNET SAILED OUT TO SEA
111-129000-0023 HE WAS NOT GOING FORTH TO PREY UPON UNRESISTING MERCHANTMEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO PUNISH A BLACK HEARTED PIRATE A FAITHLESS SCOUNDREL WHO HAD NOT ONLY ACTED
111-129000-0024 BUT HAD BEHAVED MOST DISLOYALLY AND DISRESPECTFULLY TOWARD A FELLOW PIRATE CHIEF IF HE COULD ONCE RUN THE REVENGE ALONGSIDE THE SHIP OF THE PERFIDIOUS BLACKBEARD HE WOULD SHOW HIM WHAT A GREEN HAND COULD DO
111-129000-0025 WHEN BONNET REACHED OCRACOKE INLET HE WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT
111-129000-0026 BUT HE DID NOT GIVE UP THE PURSUIT HE MADE HOT CHASE AFTER THE VESSEL OF HIS PIRATE ENEMY KEEPING A SHARP LOOKOUT IN HOPES OF DISCOVERING SOME SIGNS OF HIM IF THE ENRAGED BONNET
111-129000-0027 OF TWO ATROCIOUS VILLAINS AND CAPTAIN MAYNARD WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE HONOR OF HAVING SLAIN THE MOST FAMOUS PIRATE OF THE DAY
111-129000-0028 AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP HE UNDERSTOOD THE USE OF THE SWORD EVEN BETTER PERHAPS THAN BLACKBEARD AND THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IF THE TWO SHIPS HAD COME TOGETHER THEIR RESPECTIVE CREWS
111-129000-0029 WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THEIR CAPTAINS TO FIGHT OUT THEIR PRIVATE QUARREL WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FOR PIRATES DELIGHT IN A BLOODY SPECTACLE AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO THEM A RARE DIVERSION OF THE KIND
111-129000-0030 BUT BONNET NEVER OVERTOOK BLACKBEARD AND THE GREAT COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL PIRATES DID NOT TAKE PLACE
111-129000-0031 FOR A TRACE OR SIGHT OF BLACKBEARD THE BAFFLED BONNET GAVE UP THE PURSUIT
111-129000-0032 THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO CHANGE THE NAME OF HIS VESSEL IF HE COULD NOT BE REVENGED HE WOULD NOT SAIL IN THE REVENGE CASTING ABOUT IN HIS MIND FOR A GOOD NAME HE DECIDED TO CALL HER THE ROYAL JAMES
111-129000-0033 HAVING NO INTENTION OF RESPECTING HIS OATHS OR OF KEEPING HIS PROMISES HE THOUGHT THAT AS HE WAS GOING TO BE DISLOYAL HE MIGHT AS WELL BE AS DISLOYAL
111-129000-0034 BY THE SON OF JAMES THE SECOND WHO WAS A PRETENDER TO THE THRONE
111-129000-0035 THE NEXT THING HE DID WAS TO CHANGE HIS OWN NAME FOR HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE MATTERS BETTER FOR HIM IF HE SHOULD BE CAPTURED AFTER ENTERING UPON HIS NEW CRIMINAL CAREER SO HE CALLED HIMSELF
111-129000-0036 CAPTAIN THOMAS BY WHICH NAME HE WAS AFTERWARDS KNOWN WHEN THESE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED HE GATHERED HIS CREW TOGETHER AND ANNOUNCED THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO SAINT THOMAS
111-129000-0037 TO GET A COMMISSION AS A PRIVATEER HE HAD DETERMINED TO KEEP ON IN HIS OLD MANNER OF LIFE AND THAT HE WISHED THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONLY WAS HE A PIRATE CAPTAIN BUT THAT THEY WERE A PIRATE CREW
111-129000-0038 A VERY NATURAL THING FOR THE GREEN HAND BONNET TO GIVE UP PIRATING AFTER HE HAD BEEN SO THOROUGHLY SNUBBED BY BLACKBEARD AND THEY HAD NOT SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD EVER THINK AGAIN OF SAILING UNDER A BLACK FLAG
111-129000-0039 HOWEVER THE CREW'S OPINION OF THE GREEN HAND CAPTAIN HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL CHANGED IN HIS VARIOUS CRUISES
111-129000-0040 AND COULD NOW GIVE VERY FAIR ORDERS AND HIS FURIOUS PURSUIT OF BLACKBEARD HAD ALSO GIVEN HIM A REPUTATION FOR RECKLESS BRAVERY WHICH HE HAD NOT ENJOYED BEFORE A MAN WHO WAS
111-129000-0041 CHAFING AND FUMING FOR A CHANCE OF A HAND TO HAND CONFLICT WITH THE GREATEST PIRATE OF THE DAY
111-129000-0042 FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW MOREOVER THEIR STRUTTING AND STALKING CAPTAIN SO RECENTLY BALKED OF HIS DARK REVENGE WAS A VERY SAVAGE LOOKING MAN AND IT WOULD NOT BE PLEASANT EITHER
111-129000-0043 TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO GIVE UP HIS PIRATICAL INTENTION OR TO DECLINE TO JOIN HIM IN CARRYING IT OUT SO THE WHOLE OF THE CREW MINOR OFFICERS AND MEN CHANGED THEIR MINDS ABOUT GOING TO SAINT THOMAS
111-129000-0044 AND AGREED TO HOIST THE SKULL AND CROSS BONES AND TO FOLLOW CAPTAIN BONNET WHEREVER HE MIGHT LEAD BONNET NOW CRUISED ABOUT IN GRAND STYLE AND TOOK SOME PRIZES
111-129000-0045 ON THE VIRGINIA COAST AND THEN WENT UP INTO DELAWARE BAY WHERE HE CAPTURED SUCH SHIPS AS HE WANTED AND ACTED GENERALLY IN THE MOST DOMINEERING AND INSOLENT FASHION ONCE WHEN HE STOPPED NEAR THE TOWN OF LEWES
111-129000-0046 IN ORDER TO SEND SOME PRISONERS ASHORE HE SENT A MESSAGE TO THE OFFICERS OF THE TOWN TO THE EFFECT THAT IF THEY INTERFERED WITH HIS MEN WHEN THEY CAME ASHORE HE WOULD OPEN FIRE UPON THE TOWN WITH HIS CANNON
111-129000-0047 AND BLOW EVERY HOUSE INTO SPLINTERS OF COURSE THE CITIZENS HAVING NO WAY OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES WERE OBLIGED TO ALLOW THE PIRATES TO COME ON SHORE AND DEPART UNMOLESTED
111-129000-0048 THEN AFTER THIS THE BLUSTERING CAPTAIN CAPTURED TWO VALUABLE SLOOPS AND WISHING TO TAKE THEM ALONG WITH HIM WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF TRANSFERRING THEIR CARGOES TO HIS OWN VESSEL
111-129000-0049 HE LEFT THEIR CREWS ON BOARD AND ORDERED THEM TO FOLLOW HIM WHEREVER HE WENT SOME DAYS AFTER THAT WHEN ONE OF THE VESSELS SEEMED TO BE SAILING AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE BONNET QUICKLY LET HER CAPTAIN KNOW
111-129000-0050 THAT HE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE TRIFLED WITH AND SENT HIM THE MESSAGE THAT IF HE DID NOT KEEP CLOSE TO THE ROYAL JAMES HE WOULD FIRE INTO HIM AND SINK HIM TO THE BOTTOM
111-129000-0051 AFTER A TIME BONNET PUT INTO A NORTH CAROLINA PORT IN ORDER TO REPAIR THE ROYAL JAMES WHICH WAS BECOMING VERY LEAKY AND SEEING NO IMMEDIATE LEGITIMATE WAY OF GETTING PLANKS AND BEAMS
111-129000-0052 ENOUGH WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS HE CAPTURED A SMALL SLOOP BELONGING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BROKE IT UP IN ORDER TO GET THE MATERIAL HE NEEDED TO MAKE HIS OWN VESSEL SEAWORTHY
111-129000-0053 NOW THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST VERY SELDOM INTERFERED WITH PIRATES AS WE HAVE SEEN AND IT IS LIKELY THAT BONNET MIGHT HAVE STAYED IN PORT AS LONG AS HE PLEASED AND REPAIRED AND REFITTED
111-129000-0054 HIS VESSEL WITHOUT MOLESTATION IF HE HAD BOUGHT AND PAID FOR THE PLANKS AND TIMBER HE REQUIRED BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BOLDLY SEIZING THEIR PROPERTY
111-129000-0055 AND COMPLAINTS OF BONNET'S BEHAVIOR SPREAD FROM SETTLEMENT TO SETTLEMENT AND IT VERY SOON BECAME KNOWN ALL DOWN THE COAST THAT THERE WAS A PIRATE IN NORTH CAROLINA WHO WAS COMMITTING DEPREDATIONS
111-129000-0056 THERE AND WAS PREPARING TO SET OUT ON A FRESH CRUISE
111-129000-0057 IT HAD NOT BEEN LONG SINCE BLACKBEARD HAD VISITED THEIR HARBOR AND HAD TREATED THEM WITH SUCH BRUTAL INSOLENCE
111-129000-0058 COULD PREVENT ANOTHER VISITATION OF THE PIRATES THAT EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE
111-129000-0059 BE SENT OUT TO MEET THE PIRATES WHO WERE COMING DOWN THE COAST
