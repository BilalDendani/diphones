6509-76574-0000 OR ABOUT TWENTY THREE ENGLISH MILES BUT THE ROAD IS MOSTLY RIDABLE AND I ROLL INTO THE VILLAGE IN ABOUT THREE HOURS AND A HALF
6509-76574-0001 BY HIS PANTOMIMIC EXPLANATIONS I UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH THOUGH AND THE ROAD JUST HERE HAPPENING TO BE EXCELLENT WHEELING TO THE DELIGHT OF THE WHOLE VILLAGE I SPURT AHEAD OUTDISTANCING THE ZAPTIEH'S NOT OVER SPRIGHTLY ANIMAL
6509-76574-0002 AND BOWLING BRISKLY ALONG THE RIGHT ROAD WITHIN THEIR RANGE OF VISION FOR OVER A MILE
6509-76574-0003 WHEN A NUMBER OF PERSONS IN HOLIDAY ATTIRE PRESENT THEMSELVES OUTSIDE THE TENTS AND BY SHOUTING AND GESTURING INVITE ME TO PAY THEM A VISIT
6509-76574-0004 OR DOUBTLESS MORE PROPERLY SETTING A WORTHY EXAMPLE THEY LIKEWISE HAVE THEIR PERIODICAL REUNIONS WHERE THEY EAT DRINK SPIN YARNS SING AND TWANG THE TUNEFUL LYRE
6509-76574-0005 IN FROLICSOME CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALWAYS HAVING A HOWLING MAJORITY OVER THEIR LESS PROLIFIC NEIGHBORS REFRESHMENTS IN ABUNDANCE ARE TENDERED AND THE USUAL PANTOMIMIC EXPLANATIONS EXCHANGED BETWEEN US
6509-76574-0006 TERPSICHOREAN TALENT ARE PRANCING WILDLY ABOUT THE TENT MIDDLE AGED MATRONS ARE HERE IN PLENTY HOUSEWIFELY PERSONS FINDING THEIR CHIEF ENJOYMENT IN CATERING TO THE GASTRONOMIC PLEASURES OF THE OTHERS WHILE A SCORE OR TWO OF BLOOMING MAIDENS STAND COYLY ALOOF
6509-76574-0007 WATCHING THE FESTIVE MERRY MAKINGS OF THE MEN THEIR HEADS AND NECKS ARE RESPLENDENT WITH BANDS AND NECKLACES OF GOLD COINS IT STILL BEING A CUSTOM OF THE EAST TO LET THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY WEAR THE SURPLUS WEALTH ABOUT THEM IN THE SHAPE OF GOLD ORNAMENTS AND JEWELS
6509-76574-0008 IT IS NOT FAIR PERHAPS TO PASS JUDGMENT ON YUZGAT'S PRETENSIONS BY THE DAMSELS OF ONE FAMILY CONNECTION NOT EVEN THE GREAT AND NUMEROUS PAMPASIAN PAMPARSAN FAMILY BUT STILL THEY OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST A FAIR AVERAGE
6509-76574-0009 THEY HAVE BEAUTIFUL LARGE BLACK EYES AND USUALLY A LUXURIANT HEAD OF HAIR BUT THEIR FACES ARC ON THE WHOLE BABYISH AND EXPRESSIONLESS THE YUZGAT MAIDEN OF SWEET SIXTEEN IS A COY BABYISH CREATURE
6509-76574-0010 IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF WITNESSING AN ARMENIAN FAMILY REUNION UNDER PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS
6509-76574-0011 IS A LONE CIRCASSIAN WATCHDOG HE IS OF A STALWART WARLIKE APPEARANCE AND ALTHOUGH WEARING NO ARMS EXCEPT A CAVALRY SWORD A SHORTER BROAD SWORD A DRAGOON REVOLVER A TWO FOOT HORSE PISTOL AND A DOUBLE BARRELLED SHOT GUN SLUNG AT HIS BACK
6509-76574-0012 THE ARMENIANS SEEM TO FEEL PERFECTLY SAFE UNDER HIS PROTECTION THEY PROBABLY DON'T REQUIRE ANY SUCH PROTECTION REALLY THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS WISE IN EMPLOYING A CIRCASSIAN TO GUARD THEM IF FOR NOTHING ELSE FOR THE SAKE OF FREEING THEIR
6509-76574-0013 OWN UNWARLIKE MINDS OF ALL DISQUIETING APPREHENSIONS AND ENJOYING THEIR FAMILY REUNION IN THE CALM ATMOSPHERE OF PERFECT SECURITY SOME LAWLESS PARTY PASSING ALONG THE ROAD MIGHT PERADVENTURE DROP IN AND ABUSE THEIR HOSPITALITY
6509-76574-0014 AMONG THEIR NEIGHBORS THE CIRCASSIANS BETRAY MORE INTEREST IN MY PURELY PERSONAL AFFAIRS WHETHER I AM RUSSIAN OR ENGLISH WHITHER I AM BOUND ET CETERA AND LESS INTEREST IN THE BICYCLE THAN EITHER TURKS OR ARMENIANS
6509-76574-0015 AND SEEM ALTOGETHER OF A MORE RESERVED DISPOSITION I GENERALLY HAVE AS LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH THEM AS POSSIBLE CONFINING MYSELF TO LETTING THEM KNOW I AM ENGLISH AND NOT RUSSIAN AND REPLYING TURKCHI BINMUS I DON'T UNDERSTAND TO OTHER QUESTIONS
6509-76574-0016 APPREHENSIVE THAT THEIR OBJECT IS TO FIND OUT WHERE THREE OR FOUR OF THEM COULD SEE ME LATER I SEE BUT FEW CIRCASSIAN WOMEN WHAT FEW I APPROACH SUFFICIENTLY NEAR TO OBSERVE ARE ALL MORE OR LESS PLEASANT FACED
6509-76574-0017 PREPOSSESSING FEMALES MANY HAVE BLUE EYES WHICH IS VERY RARE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MEN AVERAGE QUITE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN AND THEY HAVE A PECULIAR DARE DEVIL EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE THAT MAKES THEM DISTINGUISHABLE IMMEDIATELY FROM EITHER TURK OR ARMENIAN
6509-76574-0018 SUCH AMONG THEM AS TAKE ANY GREAT INTEREST IN MY EXTRAORDINARY OUTFIT FIND IT ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPREHENSION THE BICYCLE IS A GORDIAN KNOT TOO INTRICATE FOR THEIR SEMI CIVILIZED MINDS TO UNRAVEL AND THERE ARE NO ALEXANDERS AMONG THEM TO THINK OF CUTTING IT
6509-76574-0019 BEFORE THEY RECOVER FROM THEIR FIRST ASTONISHMENT I HAVE DISAPPEARED THE ROAD CONTINUES FOR THE MOST PART RIDABLE UNTIL ABOUT TWO P M WHEN I ARRIVE AT A MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF ROCKY RIDGES COVERED CHIEFLY WITH A GROWTH OF SCRUB OAK
6509-76574-0020 THE VIEW PRESENTS THE STRIKING APPEARANCE OF LARGE COMPACT CABBAGE HEADS THICKLY DOTTING A WELL CULTIVATED AREA OF CLEAN BLACK LOAM SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY ROCKY UNCULTIVATABLE WILDS FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
6509-76574-0021 I AM PICKING MY WAY THROUGH THIS CULTIVATED FIELD WHICH UPON CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE PROVES TO BE A SMOOTH LAVA BED AND THE CABBAGES ARE NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN BOULDERS OF SINGULAR UNIFORMITY AND WHAT IS EQUALLY CURIOUS
6509-76574-0022 THEY ARE ALL COVERED WITH A GROWTH OF MOSS WHILE THE VOLCANIC BED THEY REPOSE ON IS PERFECTLY NAKED BEYOND THIS SINGULAR AREA THE COUNTRY CONTINUES WILD AND MOUNTAINOUS WITH NO HABITATIONS NEAR THE ROAD AND THUS IT CONTINUES UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER NIGHT FALL
6509-76574-0023 AND THE CHILLINESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE ALREADY APPARENT BODES ILL FOR ANYTHING LIKE A COMFORTABLE NIGHT BUT I SCARCELY ANTICIPATE BEING DISTURBED BY ANYTHING SAVE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS
6509-76574-0024 JUDGING FROM THE SOUNDS THEY APPEAR TO BE MAKING A BEE LINE FOR MY POSITION BUT NOT CARING TO VOLUNTARILY REVEAL MY PRESENCE I SIMPLY REMAIN QUIET AND LISTEN IT SOON BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THEY ARE A PARTY OF VILLAGERS
6509-76574-0025 COMING TO LOAD UP THEIR BUFFALO ARABAS BY MOONLIGHT WITH THESE VERY SHOCKS OF WHEAT ONE OF THE ARABAS NOW APPROACHES THE SHOCK WHICH CONCEALS MY RECUMBENT FORM AND WHERE THE PALE MOONBEAMS ARE COQUETTISHLY OGLING THE NICKEL PLATED PORTIONS OF MY WHEEL
6509-76574-0026 VANISHES LIKE A DEER IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS COMPANIONS IT IS AN UNENVIABLE SITUATION TO FIND ONE'S SELF IN IF I BOLDLY APPROACH THEM THESE PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO ASCERTAIN MY CHARACTER IN THE MOONLIGHT
6509-76574-0027 WOULD BE QUITE LIKELY TO DISCHARGE THEIR FIRE ARMS AT ME IN THEIR FRIGHT IF ON THE CONTRARY I REMAIN UNDER COVER THEY MIGHT ALSO TRY THE EXPERIMENT OF A SHOT BEFORE VENTURING TO APPROACH THE DESERTED BUFFALOES
6509-76574-0028 THAN THEY GET ALTOGETHER TOO FAMILIAR AND INQUISITIVE ABOUT MY PACKAGES AND I DETECT ONE VENTURESOME KLEPTOMANIAC SURREPTITIOUSLY UNFASTENING A STRAP WHEN HE FANCIES I AM NOT NOTICING MOREOVER
6509-76574-0029 WHILE OTHERS SUGGEST THAT I AM A POSTAYA COURIER AND THAT IT CONTAINS LETTERS UNDER THESE ALARMING CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO MANAGE THESE OVERGROWN CHILDREN THAT IS TO MAKE THEM AFRAID OF YOU FORTHWITH
6509-76574-0030 SO SHOVING THE STRAP UNFASTENER ROUGHLY AWAY I IMPERATIVELY ORDER THE WHOLE COVETOUS CREW TO HAIDI WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION THEY BETAKE THEMSELVES OFF TO THEIR WORK
6509-76574-0031 IT BEING AN INBORN TRAIT OF THEIR CHARACTER TO MECHANICALLY OBEY AN AUTHORITATIVE COMMAND FOLLOWING THEM TO THEIR OTHER ARABAS
6509-76574-0032 QUILTS ALONG INTENDING AFTER LOADING UP TO SLEEP IN THE FIELD UNTIL DAYLIGHT SELECTING A GOOD HEAVY QUILT WITH AS LITTLE CEREMONY AS THOUGH IT WERE MY OWN PROPERTY I TAKE IT AND THE BICYCLE TO ANOTHER SHOCK AND CURL MYSELF UP WARM AND COMFORTABLE
6509-76574-0033 ONCE OR TWICE THE OWNER OF THE COVERLET APPROACHES QUIETLY JUST NEAR ENOUGH TO ASCERTAIN THAT I AM NOT INTENDING MAKING OFF WITH HIS PROPERTY BUT THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST DANGER OF BEING DISTURBED OR MOLESTED IN ANY WAY TILL MORNING
6509-76574-0034 THUS IN THIS CURIOUS ROUND ABOUT MANNER DOES FORTUNE PROVIDE ME WITH THE WHEREWITHAL TO PASS A COMPARATIVELY COMFORTABLE NIGHT RATHER ARBITRARY PROCEEDINGS TO TAKE A QUILT WITHOUT ASKING PERMISSION SOME MIGHT THINK BUT THE OWNER THINKS NOTHING OF THE KIND
6509-76574-0035 AT DAYLIGHT I AM AGAIN ON THE MOVE AND SUNRISE FINDS ME BUSY MAKING AN OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CASTLE THAT OCCUPIES I SHOULD IMAGINE ONE OF THE MOST IMPREGNABLE POSITIONS IN ALL ASIA MINOR
6509-76574-0036 A REGULAR GIBRALTAR IT OCCUPIES THE SUMMIT OF A PRECIPITOUS DETACHED MOUNTAIN PEAK WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY FROM ONE POINT ALL THE OTHER SIDES PRESENTING A SHEER PRECIPICE OF ROCK IT FORMS A CONSPICUOUS FEATURE OF THE LANDSCAPE FOR MANY MILES AROUND
6509-76574-0037 AND HIS TWO GENERATIONS OF DESCENDANTS THE OLD FELLOW IS SEATED ON A ROCK SMOKING A CIGARETTE AND ENDEAVORING TO COAX A LITTLE COMFORT FROM THE SLANTING RAYS OF THE MORNING SUN AND I STRAIGHTWAY APPROACH HIM AND BROACH THE ALL IMPORTANT SUBJECT OF REFRESHMENTS
6509-76574-0038 ALLAH ANYBODY WOULD THINK FROM HIS ACTIONS THAT THE SANCTIMONIOUS OLD MAN IKIN FIVE FEET THREE
6509-76574-0039 WHEREAS HE HAS EVIDENTLY NOT EVEN EARNED THE PRIVILEGE OF WEARING A GREEN TURBAN HE HAS NEITHER BEEN TO MECCA HIMSELF DURING HIS WHOLE UNPROFITABLE LIFE NOR SENT A SUBSTITUTE
6509-76574-0040 AND HE NOW THINKS OF GAINING A NICE NUMEROUS HAREM AND A WALLED IN GARDEN WITH TREES AND FOUNTAINS CUCUMBERS AND CARPOOSES
6509-76574-0041 I FEEL TOO INDEPENDENT THIS MORNING TO SACRIFICE ANY OF THE WELLNIGH INVISIBLE REMNANT OF DIGNITY REMAINING FROM THE RESPECTABLE QUANTITY WITH WHICH I STARTED INTO ASIA FOR I STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF THE WHEATEN QUOITS I BROUGHT FROM YUZGAT
6509-76574-0042 SO LEAVING THE ANCIENT MUSSULMAN TO HIS MEDITATIONS I PUSH ON OVER THE HILLS WHEN COMING TO A SPRING I EAT MY FRUGAL BREAKFAST SOAKING THE UNBITEABLE QUOITS IN THE WATER
6509-76574-0043 AFTER GETTING BEYOND THIS HILLY REGION I EMERGE UPON A LEVEL PLATEAU OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT ACROSS WHICH VERY FAIR WHEELING IS FOUND BUT BEFORE NOON THE INEVITABLE MOUNTAINS PRESENT THEMSELVES AGAIN
6509-76574-0044 THIS DOUBTLESS COMES OF THE PURE CONTRARINESS OF HUMAN NATURE IN THE ABSENCE OF SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS THEIR RELIGION TEACHES THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY OUGHT TO BATHE EVERY DAY CONSEQUENTLY THEY NEVER BATHE AT ALL
6509-76574-0045 FOR IN SPITE OF DESPERATE POVERTY THEY KNOW MORE CONTENTMENT THAN THE WELL FED RESPECTABLY DRESSED MECHANIC OF THE WESTERN WORLD IT IS HOWEVER THE CONTENTMENT BORN OF NOT REALIZING THEIR OWN CONDITION THE BLISS THAT COMES OF IGNORANCE
6509-76574-0046 THEY SEARCH THE ENTIRE VILLAGE FOR EATABLES BUT NOTHING IS READILY OBTAINABLE BUT BREAD A FEW GAUNT ANGULAR FOWLS ARE SCRATCHING ABOUT BUT THEY HAVE A BERUFFLED DISREPUTABLE APPEARANCE AS THOUGH THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN A CONTINUOUS STRUGGLE AGAINST BEING CAUGHT AND DEVOURED
6509-76574-0047 MOREOVER I DON'T CARE TO WAIT AROUND THREE HOURS ON PURPOSE TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THESE PEOPLE'S COOKING EGGS THERE ARE NONE THEY ARE DEVOURED I FANCY ALMOST BEFORE THEY ARE LAID
6509-76574-0048 FINALLY WHILE MAKING THE BEST OF BREAD AND WATER WHICH IS HARDLY MADE MORE PALATABLE BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE PEOPLE WATCHING ME FEED A WOMAN IN AN AIRY FAIRY COSTUME THAT IS LITTLE BETTER THAN NO COSTUME AT ALL COMES FORWARD AND CONTRIBUTES A SMALL BOWL OF YAORT
6509-76574-0049 BUT UNFORTUNTAELY THIS IS OLD YAORT YAORT THAT IS IN THE SERE AND YELLOW STAGE OF ITS USEFULNESS AS HUMAN FOOD AND ALTHOUGH THESE PEOPLE DOUBTLESS CONSUME IT THUS I PREFER TO WAIT UNTIL SOMETHING MORE ACCEPTABLE AND LESS ODORIFEROUS TURNS UP
6509-76574-0050 I MISS THE GENIAL HOSPITALITY OF THE GENTLE KOORDS TO DAY INSTEAD OF HEAPING PLATES OF PILLAU AND BOWLS OF WHOLESOME NEW YAORT FICKLE FORTUNE BRINGS ME NOTHING BUT AN EXCLUSIVE DIET OF BREAD AND WATER
6509-76574-0051 MY ROAD THIS AFTERNOON IS A TORTUOUS DONKEY TRAIL INTERSECTING RAVINES WITH WELL NIGH PERPENDICULAR SIDES AND ROCKY RIDGES COVERED WITH A STUNTED GROWTH OF CEDAR AND SCRUB OAK THE HIGHER MOUNTAINS ROUND ABOUT
6509-76574-0052 ARE HEAVILY TIMBERED WITH PINE AND CEDAR A LARGE FOREST ON A MOUNTAIN SLOPE IS ON FIRE AND I PASS A CAMP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THEIR PERMANENT ABODE BY THE FLAMES FORTUNATELY THEY HAVE SAVED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THEIR NAKED HOUSES AND THEIR GRAIN
6509-76574-0053 A WAGON ROAD HAVING BEEN MADE FROM SIVAS INTO THIS FOREST TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE TO HAUL WOOD AND BUILDING TIMBER ON THEIR ARABAS ARRIVING AT A GOOD SIZED AND COMPARATIVELY WELL TO DO MUSSULMAN VILLAGE
6509-76574-0054 AND SEVERAL TIMES I AM AWAKENED BY DOGS INVADING THE KHAN AND SNIFFING ABOUT MY COUCH MY DAILY EXPERIENCE AMONG THESE PEOPLE IS TEACHING ME THE COMMENDABLE HABIT OF RISING WITH THE LARK NOT THAT I AM AN ENTHUSIASTIC STUDENT OR EVEN A WILLING ONE
6509-76574-0055 BE IT OBSERVED THAT FEW PEOPLE ARE
6509-76574-0056 OR TO BE WORRIED FROM ONE'S WAKING MOMENTS TO THE DEPARTURE FROM THE VILLAGE AND OF THE TWO EVILS ONE COMES FINALLY TO PREFER THE EARLY RISING ONE CAN ALWAYS OBTAIN SOMETHING TO EAT BEFORE STARTING BY WAITING TILL AN HOUR AFTER SUNRISE
6509-76574-0057 BUT I HAVE HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF THESE PEOPLE'S IMPORTUNITIES TO MAKE BREAKFASTING WITH THEM A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION AND SO PULL OUT AT EARLY DAYLIGHT THE ROAD IS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD
6509-76574-0058 ENTERS UPON A WORDY DEMURRER
6509-76574-0059 SOME DAY IF SHE DOESN'T BE MORE REASONABLE HER HUSBAND INSTEAD OF SATISFYING HIS OUTRAGED FEELINGS BY CHASTISING HER WITH A HOE HANDLE WILL IN A MOMENT OF PASSION BID HER BEGONE FROM HIS HOUSE WHICH IN TURKISH LAW CONSTITUTES A LEGAL SEPARATION
6509-76574-0060 IF THE COMMAND BE GIVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF A COMPETENT WITNESS IT IS IRREVOCABLE SEEING ME THUS PLACED AS IT WERE IN AN EMBARRASSING SITUATION ANOTHER WOMAN DEAR THOUGHTFUL CREATURE FETCHES ME ENOUGH WHEAT PIILAU TO FEED A MULE
6509-76574-0061 AND A NICE BOWL OF YAORT OFF WHICH I MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL BREAKFAST NEAR BY WHERE I AM EATING ARE FIVE INDUSTRIOUS MAIDENS PREPARING CRACKED OR BROKEN WHEAT BY A NOVEL AND INTERESTING PROCESS THAT HAS HITHERTO FAILED TO COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION
6509-76574-0062 AT SIVAS GATHER IN A CIRCLE ABOUT IT AND POUND THE WHEAT WITH LIGHT LONG HEADED MAULS OR BEETLES STRIKING IN REGULAR SUCCESSION AS THE READER HAS PROBABLY SEEN A GANG OF CIRCUS ROUSTABOUTS DRIVING TENT PINS
6509-76574-0063 A PLACE SUFFICIENTLY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A PUBLIC COFFEE KHAN AND SEVERAL SMALL SHOPS HERE I TAKE ABOARD A POCKETFUL OF FINE LARGE PEARS AND AFTER WHEELING A COUPLE OF MILES TO A SECLUDED SPOT
6509-76574-0064 HALT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHIFTING THE PEARS FROM MY POCKET TO WHERE THEY WILL BE BETTER APPRECIATED ERE I HAVE FINISHED THE SECOND PEAR A GENTLE GOATHERD WHO FROM AN ADJACENT HILL OBSERVED ME ALIGHT APPEARS UPON THE SCENE AND WAITS AROUND
6509-76574-0065 THE BARGAIN IS AGREED TO AND THE SOLO DULY PLAYED EAST OF YENNIKHAN THE ROAD DEVELOPS INTO AN EXCELLENT MACADAMIZED HIGHWAY ON WHICH I FIND PLENTY OF GENUINE AMUSEMENT BY ELECTRIFYING THE NATIVES WHOM I CHANCE TO MEET OR OVERTAKE
6509-76574-0066 THE AFFRIGHTED KATIR JEE'S FIRST IMPULSE IS TO SEEK REFUGE IN FLIGHT NOT INFREQUENTLY BOLTING CLEAR OFF THE ROADWAY BEFORE VENTURING UPON TAKING A SECOND LOOK SOMETIMES I SIMPLY PUT ON A SPURT AND WHISK PAST AT A FIFTEEN MILE PACE
6509-76574-0067 WENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY WITH HIS WONDERFUL ARABA WILL BECOME A RED LETTER EVENT IN THE MEMORY OF THE PEOPLE ALONG MY ROUTE THROUGH ASIA MINOR
6509-76574-0068 ON A STONE BRIDGE I FOLLOW ALONG THE VALLEY OF THE HEAD WATERS OF OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE KIZIL IRMAK
6509-76574-0069 HAVING WHEELED NEARLY FIFTY MILES TO DAY THE LAST FORTY OF WHICH WILL COMPARE FAVORABLY IN SMOOTHNESS THOUGH NOT IN LEVELUESS WITH ANY FORTY MILE STRETCH I KNOW OF IN THE UNITED STATES
6509-76574-0070 PROM ANGORA I HAVE BROUGHT A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO MISTER ERNEST WEAKLEY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN ENGAGED TOGETHER WITH MISTER KODIGAS A BELGIAN GENTLEMAN
6509-76574-0071 AND I AM SOON INSTALLED IN HOSPITABLE QUARTERS
6509-76574-0072 PARTICULARLY IN MAKING FILIGREE SILVER WORK TOWARD EVENING MYSELF AND MISTER WEAKLEY TAKE A STROLL THROUGH THE SILVERSMITHS QUARTERS THE QUARTERS CONSIST OF TWENTY OR THIRTY SMALL WOODEN SHOPS SURROUNDING AN OBLONG COURT
6509-76574-0073 RAGGED URCHINS ROMP WITH DOGS AND BABY BUFFALOES WHERE PASHAS SONS FORMERLY CONGREGATED TO LEARN WISDOM FROM THE TEACHINGS OF THEIR PROPHET AND NOW WHAT REMAINS OF THE INTRICATE ARABESQUE DESIGNS WORKED OUT IN SMALL BRIGHT COLORED TILES
