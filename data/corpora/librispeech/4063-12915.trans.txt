4063-12915-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE END OF THE STRUGGLE BEING UNABLE TO OBTAIN ANY SUPPLIES AT WILMINGTON LORD CORNWALLIS DETERMINED TO MARCH ON INTO VIRGINIA
4063-12915-0001 AND TO EFFECT A JUNCTION WITH THE BRITISH FORCE UNDER GENERAL ARNOLD OPERATING THERE
4063-12915-0002 THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE WHO COMMANDED THE COLONIAL FORCES HERE FELL BACK JUST AT THIS TIME
4063-12915-0003 WITH A LARGE FRENCH FLEET ARRIVED OFF THE COAST AND AFTER SOME CONSULTATION WITH GENERAL WASHINGTON DETERMINED THAT THE FRENCH FLEET AND THE WHOLE AMERICAN ARMY SHOULD OPERATE TOGETHER TO CRUSH THE FORCES
4063-12915-0004 UNDER LORD CORNWALLIS THE ENGLISH WERE HOODWINKED BY REPORTS THAT THE FRENCH FLEET WAS INTENDED TO OPERATE AGAINST NEW YORK
4063-12915-0005 THAT THE TRUE OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION WAS SEEN A PORTION OF THE ENGLISH FLEET ENCOUNTERED THEM BUT AFTER IRREGULAR ACTIONS LASTING OVER FIVE DAYS THE ENGLISH DREW OFF AND RETIRED TO NEW YORK
4063-12915-0006 THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF THEN ATTEMPTED TO EFFECT A DIVERSION IN ORDER TO DRAW OFF SOME OF THE ENEMY WHO WERE SURROUNDING CORNWALLIS THE FORT OF NEW LONDON WAS STORMED AFTER SOME DESPERATE FIGHTING
4063-12915-0007 MATTERS WERE IN A MOST CRITICAL CONDITION FOR ALTHOUGH TO THE ENGLISH THE PROSPECT OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS APPEARED SLIGHT INDEED THE AMERICANS WERE IN A DESPERATE CONDITION THEIR IMMENSE AND LONG CONTINUED EFFORTS HAD BEEN UNATTENDED
4063-12915-0008 WITH ANY MATERIAL SUCCESS IT WAS TRUE THAT THE BRITISH TROOPS HELD NO MORE GROUND NOW THAN THEY DID AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THE WAR BUT NO EFFORTS OF THE COLONISTS HAD SUCCEEDED IN WRESTING THAT GROUND FROM THEM
4063-12915-0009 THE PEOPLE WERE EXHAUSTED AND UTTERLY DISHEARTENED BUSINESS OF ALL SORTS WAS AT A STANDSTILL MONEY HAD CEASED TO CIRCULATE AND THE CREDIT OF CONGRESS STOOD SO LOW THAT ITS BONDS HAD CEASED TO HAVE ANY VALUE WHATEVER
4063-12915-0010 THE SOLDIERS WERE UNPAID ILL FED AND MUTINOUS IF ON THE ENGLISH SIDE IT SEEMED THAT THE TASK OF CONQUERING WAS BEYOND THEM THE AMERICANS WERE READY TO ABANDON THE DEFENSE FROM SHEER EXHAUSTION
4063-12915-0011 IT WAS THEN OF PARAMOUNT NECESSITY TO GENERAL WASHINGTON THAT A GREAT AND STRIKING SUCCESS SHOULD BE OBTAINED TO ANIMATE THE SPIRITS OF THE PEOPLE CORNWALLIS SEEING THE FORMIDABLE COMBINATION WHICH THE FRENCH AND AMERICANS WERE MAKING TO CRUSH HIM
4063-12915-0012 SENT MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE TO NEW YORK TO ASK FOR AID FROM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND RECEIVED ASSURANCES FROM HIM THAT HE WOULD AT ONCE SAIL WITH FOUR THOUSAND TROOPS TO JOIN HIM ACCORDINGLY IN OBEDIENCE TO HIS ORDERS
4063-12915-0013 LORD CORNWALLIS FORTIFIED HIMSELF AT YORKTOWN ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH THE COMBINED ARMY OF FRENCH AND AMERICANS CONSISTING OF SEVEN THOUSAND OF THE FORMER AND TWELVE THOUSAND OF THE LATTER APPEARED BEFORE YORKTOWN AND THE POST AT GLOUCESTER
4063-12915-0014 BUT SO GREAT HAD BEEN THE EFFECTS OF THE DEADLY CLIMATE IN THE AUTUMN MONTHS
4063-12915-0015 THE ENEMY AT ONCE INVESTED THE TOWN AND OPENED THEIR TRENCHES AGAINST IT FROM THEIR FLEET THEY HAD DRAWN AN ABUNDANCE OF HEAVY ARTILLERY AND ON OCTOBER NINTH THEIR BATTERIES OPENED A TREMENDOUS FIRE UPON THE WORKS
4063-12915-0016 EACH DAY THEY PUSHED THEIR TRENCHES CLOSER AND THE BRITISH FORCE WAS TOO WEAK IN COMPARISON WITH THE NUMBER OF ITS ASSAILANTS TO VENTURE UPON SORTIES THE FIRE FROM THE WORKS WAS COMPLETELY OVERPOWERED BY THAT OF THE ENEMY
4063-12915-0017 AND THE AMMUNITION WAS NEARLY EXHAUSTED DAY AFTER DAY PASSED AND STILL THE PROMISED RE ENFORCEMENTS DID NOT ARRIVE LORD CORNWALLIS WAS TOLD POSITIVELY THAT THE FLEET WOULD SET SAIL ON OCTOBER EIGHTH
4063-12915-0018 BUT IT CAME NOT NOR DID IT LEAVE PORT UNTIL THE NINETEENTH THE DAY ON WHICH LORD CORNWALLIS SURRENDERED ON THE SIXTEENTH FINDING THAT HE MUST EITHER SURRENDER OR BREAK THROUGH
4063-12915-0019 HE DETERMINED TO CROSS THE RIVER AND FALL ON THE FRENCH REAR WITH HIS WHOLE FORCE AND THEN TURN NORTHWARD AND FORCE HIS WAY THROUGH MARYLAND PENNSYLVANIA AND THE JERSEYS IN THE NIGHT THE LIGHT INFANTRY THE GREATER PART OF THE GUARDS
4063-12915-0020 AND PART OF THE TWENTY THIRD WERE EMBARKED IN BOATS
4063-12915-0021 AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT A VIOLENT STORM AROSE WHICH PREVENTED THE BOATS RETURNING THE ENEMY'S FIRE REOPENED AT DAYBREAK AND THE ENGINEER AND PRINCIPAL OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
4063-12915-0022 GAVE IT AS THEIR OPINION THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST LONGER ONLY ONE EIGHT INCH SHELL AND A HUNDRED SMALL ONES REMAINED THE DEFENSES HAD IN MANY PLACES TUMBLED TO RUINS
4063-12915-0023 AND NO EFFECTUAL RESISTANCE COULD BE OPPOSED TO AN ASSAULT ACCORDINGLY LORD CORNWALLIS SENT OUT A FLAG OF TRUCE AND ARRANGED TERMS OF SURRENDER ON THE TWENTY FOURTH THE FLEET AND RE ENFORCEMENTS ARRIVED OFF THE MOUTH OF THE CHESAPEAKE
4063-12915-0024 HAD THEY LEFT NEW YORK AT THE TIME PROMISED THE RESULT OF THE CAMPAIGN WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT THE ARMY SURRENDERED AS PRISONERS OF WAR UNTIL EXCHANGED THE OFFICERS WITH LIBERTY TO PROCEED ON PAROLE TO EUROPE AND NOT TO SERVE UNTIL EXCHANGED
4063-12915-0025 THE LOYAL AMERICANS WERE EMBARKED ON THE BONITO SLOOP OF WAR AND SENT TO NEW YORK IN SAFETY LORD CORNWALLIS HAVING OBTAINED PERMISSION TO SEND OFF THE SHIP WITHOUT HER BEING SEARCHED WITH AS MANY SOLDIERS ON BOARD AS HE SHOULD THINK FIT
4063-12915-0026 SO THAT THEY WERE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ANY FURTHER EXCHANGE HE WAS THUS ENABLED TO SEND OFF SUCH OF THE INHABITANTS AND LOYALIST TROOPS AS WOULD HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE VENGEANCE OF THE AMERICANS
4063-12915-0027 VIRTUALLY ENDED THE WAR THE BURDEN ENTAILED ON THE PEOPLE IN ENGLAND BY THE GREAT STRUGGLE AGAINST FRANCE SPAIN HOLLAND AND AMERICA UNITED IN ARMS AGAINST HER WAS ENORMOUS
4063-12915-0028 BUT THE CONVICTION THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO WAGE A WAR WITH HALF OF EUROPE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO CONQUER A CONTINENT HAD BEEN GAINING MORE AND MORE IN STRENGTH EVEN THE MOST SANGUINE
4063-12915-0029 WERE SILENCED BY THE SURRENDER OF YORKTOWN AND A CRY AROSE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT PEACE SHOULD AT ONCE BE MADE AS USUAL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES A CHANGE OF MINISTRY TOOK PLACE
4063-12915-0030 NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE WERE AT ONCE COMMENCED AND THE WAR TERMINATED IN THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAROLD WITH HIS COMPANIONS HAD FALLEN BACK TO CHARLESTON WITH LORD RAWDON
4063-12915-0031 AFTER THE RELIEF OF NINETY SIX AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE NEWS ARRIVED THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE ON FOOT AND THAT PEACE WAS NOW CERTAIN THEN HE TOOK HIS DISCHARGE AND SAILED AT ONCE FOR ENGLAND ACCOMPANIED BY JAKE

4063-12915-0037 AND SETTLED DOWN ON THE ESTATE SUPPLYING IT WITH FISH AND GAME SO LONG AS HIS STRENGTH ENABLED HIM TO GO ABOUT AND ENJOYING THE SOCIETY OF JACK PEARSON WHO HAD MARRIED AND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF ON A FARM CLOSE BY
4063-12915-0038 AND HAROLD BEFORE HE DIED WAS ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST RESPECTED MEN IN THE COLONY
4063-12915-0039 BUT AFTER HER DEATH HIS FAMILY AND FARM HAD SO INCREASED THAT IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO LEAVE THEM HIS FATHER THEREFORE RETURNED WITH HIM TO CANADA AND ENDED HIS LIFE THERE
4063-12915-0040 JAKE LIVED TO A GOOD OLD AGE AND WAS HAROLD'S FAITHFUL FRIEND AND RIGHT HAND MAN TO THE LAST
