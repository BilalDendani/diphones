4071-176278-0010 THE RULERS OF THE CITY MOURNED THE PEOPLE COMPLAINED WOMEN AND CHILDREN WEPT AND ALL EXCLAIMED AGAINST THE COUNT AS FALSE AND PERFIDIOUS ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NOT HOPE THAT EITHER PRAYERS OR PROMISES WOULD DIVERT HIM FROM HIS UNGRATEFUL DESIGN

4071-176278-0018 AND FAITHLESS ARMS LIKE THINE MAY OUR EXAMPLE INSTRUCT POSTERITY SINCE THAT OF THEBES AND PHILIP OF MACEDON WHO AFTER VICTORY OVER HER ENEMIES FROM BEING HER CAPTAIN BECAME HER FOE AND HER PRINCE
4071-176278-0019 STILL THIS WANT OF CAUTION IN US DOES NOT EXCUSE THE PERFIDY IN THEE NOR CAN IT OBLITERATE THE INFAMY WITH WHICH OUR JUST COMPLAINTS WILL BLACKEN THY CHARACTER THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
4071-176278-0020 AND THOUGH AMBITION SHOULD BLIND THINE EYES THE WHOLE WORLD WITNESS TO THINE INIQUITY WILL COMPEL THEE TO OPEN THEM GOD HIMSELF WILL UNCLOSE THEM IF PERJURIES IF VIOLATED FAITH IF TREACHERIES DISPLEASE HIM

4071-176278-0022 BUT IF WE FOUND WE COULD NOT ULTIMATELY DEFEND IT WE WOULD SUBMIT OURSELVES TO ANYONE RATHER THAN TO THEE AND IF OUR SINS BE SO GREAT THAT IN SPITE OF OUR UTMOST RESOLUTION WE SHOULD STILL FALL INTO THY HANDS BE QUITE ASSURED
4071-176278-0023 THAT THE SOVEREIGNTY WHICH IS COMMENCED IN DECEIT AND VILLAINY WILL TERMINATE EITHER IN THYSELF OR THY CHILDREN WITH IGNOMINY AND BLOOD THE COUNT THOUGH NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE JUST REPROACHES OF THE MILANESE
4071-176278-0024 DID NOT EXHIBIT EITHER BY WORDS OR GESTURES ANY UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT AND REPLIED THAT HE WILLINGLY ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR ANGRY FEELINGS ALL THE SERIOUS CHARGES OF THEIR INDISCREET HARANGUE AND HE WOULD REPLY TO THEM IN DETAIL WERE HE IN THE PRESENCE OF ANYONE WHO COULD DECIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES
4071-176278-0025 IT WOULD THUS BE MANIFEST THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN WHEN HE HAD EFFECTED THE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH THEY FIRST ATTEMPTED TO MAKE AND THAT IF HE HAD DEFERRED TO DO SO A LITTLE LONGER
4071-176278-0026 WHETHER THE CHARGE WERE TRUE OR FALSE THAT GOD WHOM THEY HAD INVOKED TO AVENGE THEIR INJURIES WOULD SHOW AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE WAR AND WOULD DEMONSTRATE WHICH WAS MOST HIS FRIEND
4071-176278-0027 AT LEAST TILL THEY COULD DEPRIVE THE COUNT OF THE AID OF THE VENETIANS WHO THEY DID NOT THINK WOULD LONG BE EITHER FRIENDLY OR FAITHFUL TO HIM ON THE OTHER HAND THE COUNT PERFECTLY AWARE OF THIS THOUGHT IT NOT IMPRUDENT SUPPOSING THE OBLIGATION OF THE TREATY INSUFFICIENT
4071-176278-0028 TO BIND THEM BY THE TIES OF INTEREST AND THEREFORE IN ASSIGNING TO EACH THEIR PORTION OF THE ENTERPRISE HE CONSENTED THAT THE VENETIANS SHOULD ATTACK CREMA AND HIMSELF WITH THE OTHER FORCES ASSAIL THE REMAINDER OF THE TERRITORY
4071-176278-0029 NEITHER DID THEY THINK HE WOULD BE CONTENT WITH THE BOUNDARIES ASSIGNED HIM BY THE TREATY
4071-176278-0030 AND WISHING BEFORE THEY CHANGED SIDES TO EFFECT THIS POINT THEY PUBLICLY ANSWERED THE ENVOYS THAT THEIR ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE COUNT PREVENTED THEM FROM DEFENDING THE MILANESE BUT SECRETLY GAVE THEM EVERY ASSURANCE OF THEIR WISH TO DO SO
4071-176278-0031 WITH WHOM THEY MADE PEACE AND ENTERED INTO ALLIANCE
4071-176278-0032 HAVING COME TO THIS AGREEMENT
4071-176278-0033 AND TO RETURN TO THE VENETIAN TERRITORY
4071-176278-0034 HE COULD NOT AVOID FEELING REGRET AND DISPLEASURE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE MILANESE HAD EXPERIENCED WHEN HE ABANDONED THEM HE TOOK TWO DAYS TO CONSIDER THE REPLY HE WOULD MAKE TO THE AMBASSADORS WHOM THE VENETIANS HAD SENT TO INFORM HIM OF THE TREATY AND DURING THIS TIME
4071-176278-0035 HE DETERMINED TO DUPE THE VENETIANS AND NOT ABANDON HIS ENTERPRISE THEREFORE APPEARING OPENLY TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL FOR PEACE
4071-176278-0036 AND WITH PRETEXTS OR CAVILING TO PUT IT OFF TO GIVE THE VENETIANS GREATER ASSURANCE OF HIS SINCERITY HE MADE A TRUCE WITH THE MILANESE FOR A MONTH WITHDREW FROM MILAN
4071-176278-0037 FOR THE VENETIANS CONFIDENT OF PEACE WERE SLOW IN PREPARING FOR WAR AND THE MILANESE FINDING THE TRUCE CONCLUDED THE ENEMY WITHDRAWN AND THE VENETIANS THEIR FRIENDS FELT ASSURED THAT THE COUNT HAD DETERMINED TO ABANDON HIS DESIGN
4071-176278-0038 AND BY WHOM HE HAD CONSTANTLY BEEN FAITHFULLY ADVISED AND LIBERALLY SUPPORTED NOR DID COSMO ABANDON HIM IN HIS EXTREME NECESSITY BUT SUPPLIED HIM GENEROUSLY FROM HIS OWN RESOURCES AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO PROSECUTE HIS DESIGN HE ALSO WISHED THE CITY PUBLICLY TO ASSIST HIM
4071-176278-0039 IN THE FIRST PLACE HE APPREHENDED THAT THE MILANESE THROUGH THEIR ANGER AGAINST THE COUNT WOULD SURRENDER THEMSELVES ENTIRELY TO THE VENETIANS WHICH WOULD OCCASION THE RUIN OF ALL SUPPOSING HE SHOULD OCCUPY MILAN
4071-176278-0040 IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT SO GREAT MILITARY SUPERIORITY COMBINED WITH SUCH AN EXTENT OF TERRITORY WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO THEMSELVES
4071-176278-0041 WHICH COULD NEVER BE UNITED TO INJURE OTHERS AND SEPARATELY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO TO ATTAIN THIS HE SAW NO BETTER MEANS THAN TO REFRAIN FROM AIDING THE COUNT AND CONTINUING IN THE FORMER LEAGUE WITH THE VENETIANS THESE REASONINGS WERE NOT SATISFACTORY TO COSMO'S FRIENDS
4071-176278-0042 POINTED OUT THAT TO LEND ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNT WOULD BE HIGHLY BENEFICIAL BOTH TO ITALY
4071-176278-0043 OR THE VENETIANS HER LORDS AND SURELY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES NO ONE COULD DOUBT WHICH WOULD BE MOST TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO HAVE FOR THEIR NEIGHBOR A POWERFUL FRIEND OR A FAR MORE POWERFUL FOE NEITHER NEED IT BE APPREHENDED THAT THE MILANESE
