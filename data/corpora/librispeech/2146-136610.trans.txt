2146-136610-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY REVOLT OF THE GOTHS
2146-136610-0001 REVOLT OF THE GOTHS THEY PLUNDER GREECE TWO GREAT INVASIONS OF ITALY BY ALARIC AND RADAGAISUS
2146-136610-0002 THE GERMANS OVERRUN GAUL USURPATION OF CONSTANTINE IN THE WEST DISGRACE AND DEATH OF STILICHO IF THE SUBJECTS OF ROME COULD BE IGNORANT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE GREAT THEODOSIUS
2146-136610-0003 THEY WERE TOO SOON CONVINCED HOW PAINFULLY THE SPIRIT AND ABILITIES OF THEIR DECEASED EMPEROR HAD SUPPORTED THE FRAIL AND MOULDERING EDIFICE OF THE REPUBLIC HE DIED IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WINTER OF THE SAME YEAR
2146-136610-0004 AND BOLDLY AVOWED THE HOSTILE DESIGNS WHICH THEY HAD LONG CHERISHED IN THEIR FEROCIOUS MINDS THEIR COUNTRYMEN WHO HAD BEEN CONDEMNED BY THE CONDITIONS OF THE LAST TREATY TO A LIFE OF TRANQUILITY AND LABOR
2146-136610-0005 DESERTED THEIR FARMS AT THE FIRST SOUND OF THE TRUMPET AND EAGERLY RESUMED THE WEAPONS WHICH THEY HAD RELUCTANTLY LAID DOWN THE BARRIERS OF THE DANUBE WERE THROWN OPEN THE SAVAGE WARRIORS OF SCYTHIA ISSUED FROM THEIR FORESTS
2146-136610-0006 AND THE UNCOMMON SEVERITY OF THE WINTER ALLOWED THE POET TO REMARK
2146-136610-0007 WHICH IN THE COURSE OF TWENTY YEARS WERE ALMOST GROWN FAMILIAR TO THEIR IMAGINATION AND THE VARIOUS TROOPS OF BARBARIANS WHO GLORIED IN THE GOTHIC NAME WERE IRREGULARLY SPREAD FROM WOODY SHORES OF DALMATIA
2146-136610-0008 FROM A MOTIVE EITHER OF GRATITUDE OR OF POLICY WAS ATTENTIVE AMIDST THE GENERAL DEVASTATION
2146-136610-0009 WHICH YIELDED ONLY TO THE ROYAL DIGNITY OF THE AMALI HE HAD SOLICITED THE COMMAND OF THE ROMAN ARMIES AND THE IMPERIAL COURT PROVOKED HIM TO DEMONSTRATE THE FOLLY OF THEIR REFUSAL AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR LOSS
2146-136610-0010 WHATEVER HOPES MIGHT BE ENTERTAINED OF THE CONQUEST OF CONSTANTINOPLE THE JUDICIOUS GENERAL SOON ABANDONED AN IMPRACTICABLE ENTERPRISE IN THE MIDST OF A DIVIDED COURT AND A DISCONTENTED PEOPLE
2146-136610-0011 THE EMPEROR ARCADIUS WAS TERRIFIED BY THE ASPECT OF THE GOTHIC ARMS BUT THE WANT OF WISDOM AND VALOR WAS SUPPLIED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE CITY
2146-136610-0012 THE TREATY WAS RATIFIED BY SOLEMN OATHS AND OBSERVED WITH MUTUAL FIDELITY THE GOTHIC PRINCE WITH A SMALL AND SELECT TRAIN WAS ADMITTED WITHIN THE WALLS
2146-136610-0013 HE INDULGED HIMSELF IN THE REFRESHMENT OF THE BATH ACCEPTED A SPLENDID BANQUET WHICH WAS PROVIDED BY THE MAGISTRATE
2146-136610-0014 TO THE TOWN OF MEGARA WAS BLASTED BY HIS BALEFUL PRESENCE AND IF WE MAY USE THE COMPARISON OF A CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHER ATHENS ITSELF RESEMBLED THE BLEEDING AND EMPTY SKIN OF A SLAUGHTERED VICTIM
2146-136610-0015 THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MEGARA AND CORINTH COULD NOT MUCH EXCEED THIRTY MILES BUT THE BAD ROAD AN EXPRESSIVE NAME WHICH IT STILL BEARS AMONG THE GREEKS
2146-136610-0016 WAS OR MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN MADE IMPASSABLE FOR THE MARCH OF AN ENEMY THE THICK AND GLOOMY WOODS OF MOUNT CITHAERON COVERED THE INLAND COUNTRY
2146-136610-0017 WAS TERMINATED BY THE ISTHMUS OF CORINTH AND A SMALL A BODY OF FIRM AND INTREPID SOLDIERS MIGHT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED A TEMPORARY INTRENCHMENT OF FIVE OR SIX MILES FROM THE IONIAN TO THE AEGEAN SEA
2146-136610-0018 IN THEIR NATURAL RAMPART HAD TEMPTED THEM TO NEGLECT THE CARE OF THEIR ANTIQUE WALLS
2146-136610-0019 AND THE MOST FORTUNATE OF THE INHABITANTS WERE SAVED BY DEATH FROM BEHOLDING THE SLAVERY OF THEIR FAMILIES
2146-136610-0020 WITH MORE REGARD TO THE VALUE OF THE MATERIALS THAN TO THE ELEGANCE OF THE WORKMANSHIP THE FEMALE CAPTIVES SUBMITTED TO THE LAWS OF WAR
2146-136610-0021 WHO HAD CONSIDERED VALOR AND DISCIPLINE AS THE WALLS OF SPARTA
2146-136610-0022 WITH THE UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE BARBARIAN CHIEFTAINS
2146-136610-0023 SEATED ON THE VERGE OF THE TWO EMPIRES
2146-136610-0024 THOSE OF ASIA WERE INACCESSIBLE
2146-136610-0025 HE MAY AMUSE HIMSELF WITH CONTEMPLATING FOR A MOMENT THE INFLUENCE OF THE ARMS OF ALARIC ON THE FORTUNES OF TWO OBSCURE INDIVIDUALS A PRESBYTER OF AQUILEIA AND A HUSBANDMAN OF VERONA
2146-136610-0026 AND THE BARBARIANS WHO FURIOUSLY SHOOK THE WALLS OF AQUILEIA MIGHT SAVE HIM FROM THE CRUEL SENTENCE OF ANOTHER HERETIC
2146-136610-0027 HIS PLEASURES HIS DESIRES HIS KNOWLEDGE WERE CONFINED WITHIN THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF HIS PATERNAL FARM
2146-136610-0028 ON THE SAME GROUND WHERE HE HAD SPORTED IN HIS INFANCY YET EVEN THIS HUMBLE AND RUSTIC FELICITY
2146-136610-0029 A DETACHMENT OF GOTHIC CAVALRY MIGHT SWEEP AWAY HIS COTTAGE AND HIS FAMILY AND THE POWER OF ALARIC COULD DESTROY THIS HAPPINESS
2146-136610-0030 FAME SAYS THE POET ENCIRCLING WITH TERROR HER GLOOMY WINGS PROCLAIMED THE MARCH OF THE BARBARIAN ARMY AND FILLED ITALY WITH CONSTERNATION
2146-136610-0031 THE APPREHENSIONS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL WERE INCREASED IN JUST PROPORTION TO THE MEASURE OF HIS FORTUNE AND THE MOST TIMID WHO HAD ALREADY EMBARKED THEIR VALUABLE EFFECTS MEDITATED THEIR ESCAPE TO THE ISLAND OF SICILY OR THE AFRICAN COAST
