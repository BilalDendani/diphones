7408-255932-0022 I SHALL BE GONE ONLY A FEW MOMENTS
7408-255932-0023 HASTILY QUITTED THE APARTMENT BUT REFLECTING THAT THE SIGHT OF THE DEPUTY PROCUREUR RUNNING THROUGH THE STREETS WOULD BE ENOUGH TO THROW THE WHOLE CITY INTO CONFUSION HE RESUMED HIS ORDINARY PACE AT HIS DOOR HE PERCEIVED A FIGURE IN THE SHADOW THAT SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HIM
7408-255932-0024 IT WAS MERCEDES WHO HEARING NO NEWS OF HER LOVER HAD COME UNOBSERVED TO INQUIRE AFTER HIM
7408-255932-0025 SHE ADVANCED AND STOOD BEFORE HIM
7408-255932-0026 AND VILLEFORT INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED HER HER BEAUTY AND HIGH BEARING SURPRISED HIM AND WHEN SHE INQUIRED WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER LOVER IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE WAS THE JUDGE AND HE THE ACCUSED THE YOUNG MAN YOU SPEAK OF
7408-255932-0027 IS A GREAT CRIMINAL AND I CAN DO NOTHING FOR HIM MADEMOISELLE MERCEDES BURST INTO TEARS
7408-255932-0028 AGAIN ADDRESSED HIM BUT AT LEAST TELL ME WHERE HE IS THAT I MAY KNOW WHETHER HE IS ALIVE OR DEAD SAID SHE I DO NOT KNOW HE IS NO LONGER IN MY HANDS
7408-255932-0029 AND DESIROUS OF PUTTING AN END TO THE INTERVIEW HE PUSHED BY HER AND CLOSED THE DOOR AS IF TO EXCLUDE THE PAIN HE FELT BUT REMORSE IS NOT THUS BANISHED LIKE VIRGIL'S WOUNDED HERO HE CARRIED THE ARROW IN HIS WOUND AND ARRIVED AT THE SALON
7408-255932-0030 UTTERED A SIGH THAT WAS ALMOST A SOB AND SANK INTO A CHAIR THEN THE FIRST PANGS OF AN UNENDING TORTURE SEIZED UPON HIS HEART THE MAN HE SACRIFICED TO HIS AMBITION THAT INNOCENT VICTIM
7408-255932-0031 IMMOLATED ON THE ALTAR OF HIS FATHER'S FAULTS APPEARED TO HIM PALE AND THREATENING
7408-255932-0032 AND BRINGING WITH HIM REMORSE NOT SUCH AS THE ANCIENTS FIGURED FURIOUS AND TERRIBLE BUT THAT SLOW AND CONSUMING AGONY WHOSE PANGS ARE INTENSIFIED FROM HOUR TO HOUR UP TO THE VERY MOMENT OF DEATH
7408-255932-0033 THEN HE HAD A MOMENT'S HESITATION HE HAD FREQUENTLY CALLED FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ON CRIMINALS AND OWING TO HIS IRRESISTIBLE ELOQUENCE THEY HAD BEEN CONDEMNED AND YET THE SLIGHTEST SHADOW OF REMORSE
7408-255932-0034 BECAUSE THEY WERE GUILTY AT LEAST HE BELIEVED SO BUT HERE WAS AN INNOCENT MAN WHOSE HAPPINESS HE HAD DESTROYED IN THIS CASE HE WAS NOT THE JUDGE BUT THE EXECUTIONER AS HE THUS REFLECTED
7408-255932-0035 HE FELT THE SENSATION WE HAVE DESCRIBED AND WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN UNKNOWN TO HIM ARISE IN HIS BOSOM AND FILL HIM WITH VAGUE APPREHENSIONS IT IS THUS THAT A WOUNDED MAN TREMBLES INSTINCTIVELY AT THE APPROACH OF THE FINGER TO HIS WOUND UNTIL IT BE HEALED
7408-255932-0036 WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT NEVER CLOSE OR IF THEY DO ONLY CLOSE TO REOPEN MORE AGONIZING THAN EVER IF AT THIS MOMENT THE SWEET VOICE OF RENEE HAD SOUNDED IN HIS EARS PLEADING FOR MERCY
7408-255932-0037 HIS COLD AND TREMBLING HANDS WOULD HAVE SIGNED HIS RELEASE BUT NO VOICE BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE CHAMBER
7408-255932-0038 WHO CAME TO TELL HIM THAT THE TRAVELLING CARRIAGE WAS IN READINESS
7408-255932-0039 EMPTIED ALL THE GOLD IT CONTAINED INTO HIS POCKET STOOD MOTIONLESS AN INSTANT HIS HAND PRESSED TO HIS HEAD MUTTERED A FEW INARTICULATE SOUNDS AND THEN PERCEIVING THAT HIS SERVANT HAD PLACED HIS CLOAK ON HIS SHOULDERS HE SPRANG INTO THE CARRIAGE
7408-255932-0040 THE HAPLESS DANTES WAS DOOMED AS THE MARQUIS HAD PROMISED
7408-255932-0041 FOUND THE MARQUISE AND RENEE IN WAITING HE STARTED WHEN HE SAW RENEE FOR HE FANCIED SHE WAS AGAIN ABOUT TO PLEAD FOR DANTES ALAS HER EMOTIONS WERE WHOLLY PERSONAL
7408-255932-0042 AND HE LEFT HER AT THE MOMENT HE WAS ABOUT TO BECOME HER HUSBAND
7408-255932-0043 RENEE FAR FROM PLEADING FOR DANTES HATED THE MAN WHOSE CRIME SEPARATED HER FROM HER LOVER MEANWHILE WHAT OF MERCEDES SHE HAD MET FERNAND AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DE LA LOGE
7408-255932-0044 SHE HAD RETURNED TO THE CATALANS AND HAD DESPAIRINGLY CAST HERSELF ON HER COUCH FERNAND KNEELING BY HER SIDE TOOK HER HAND AND COVERED IT WITH KISSES THAT MERCEDES DID NOT EVEN FEEL SHE PASSED THE NIGHT THUS
7408-255932-0045 THE LAMP WENT OUT FOR WANT OF OIL BUT SHE PAID NO HEED TO THE DARKNESS AND DAWN CAME BUT SHE KNEW NOT THAT IT WAS DAY GRIEF HAD MADE HER BLIND TO ALL BUT ONE OBJECT THAT WAS
7408-255932-0046 EDMOND AH YOU ARE THERE
7408-255932-0047 I HAVE NOT QUITTED YOU SINCE YESTERDAY RETURNED FERNAND SORROWFULLY
7408-255932-0048 HE HAD LEARNED THAT DANTES HAD BEEN TAKEN TO PRISON AND HE HAD GONE TO ALL HIS FRIENDS AND THE INFLUENTIAL PERSONS OF THE CITY BUT THE REPORT WAS ALREADY IN CIRCULATION THAT DANTES WAS ARRESTED AS A BONAPARTIST AGENT
7408-255932-0049 AND AS THE MOST SANGUINE LOOKED UPON ANY ATTEMPT OF NAPOLEON TO REMOUNT THE THRONE AS IMPOSSIBLE
7408-255932-0050 AND HAD RETURNED HOME IN DESPAIR DECLARING THAT THE MATTER WAS SERIOUS AND THAT NOTHING MORE COULD BE DONE CADEROUSSE WAS EQUALLY RESTLESS AND UNEASY
7408-255932-0051 HE HAD SHUT HIMSELF UP WITH TWO BOTTLES OF BLACK CURRANT BRANDY IN THE HOPE OF DROWNING REFLECTION BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED AND BECAME TOO INTOXICATED TO FETCH ANY MORE DRINK AND YET NOT SO INTOXICATED AS TO FORGET WHAT HAD HAPPENED
7408-255932-0052 WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE HE SAT BETWEEN THE TWO EMPTY BOTTLES WHILE SPECTRES DANCED IN THE LIGHT OF THE UNSNUFFED CANDLE SPECTRES SUCH AS HOFFMANN STREWS OVER HIS PUNCH DRENCHED PAGES LIKE BLACK FANTASTIC DUST
7408-255932-0053 WAS CONTENT AND JOYOUS HE HAD GOT RID OF AN ENEMY AND MADE HIS OWN SITUATION ON THE PHARAON SECURE
7408-255932-0054 WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN BORN WITH A PEN BEHIND THE EAR AND AN INKSTAND IN PLACE OF A HEART EVERYTHING WITH HIM WAS MULTIPLICATION OR SUBTRACTION THE LIFE OF A MAN WAS TO HIM OF FAR LESS VALUE THAN A NUMERAL ESPECIALLY WHEN BY TAKING IT AWAY
7408-255932-0055 HE COULD INCREASE THE SUM TOTAL OF HIS OWN DESIRES HE WENT TO BED AT HIS USUAL HOUR AND SLEPT IN PEACE
7408-255932-0056 EMBRACED RENEE KISSED THE MARQUISE'S HAND AND SHAKEN THAT OF THE MARQUIS STARTED FOR PARIS ALONG THE AIX ROAD OLD DANTES WAS DYING WITH ANXIETY TO KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF EDMOND
