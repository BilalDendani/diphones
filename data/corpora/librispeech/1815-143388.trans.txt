1815-143388-0000 THE FRAILTY OF THE SEXES WAS ASSIMILATED TO POISON OR ASSASSINATION TO SORCERY OR PARRICIDE THE SAME PENALTIES WERE INFLICTED ON THE PASSIVE AND ACTIVE GUILT OF PAEDERASTY
1815-143388-0001 AND ALL CRIMINALS OF FREE OR SERVILE CONDITION WERE EITHER DROWNED OR BEHEADED OR CAST ALIVE INTO THE AVENGING FLAMES THE ADULTERERS WERE SPARED BY THE COMMON SYMPATHY OF MANKIND
1815-143388-0002 BUT THE LOVERS OF THEIR OWN SEX WERE PURSUED BY GENERAL AND PIOUS INDIGNATION THE IMPURE MANNERS OF GREECE STILL PREVAILED IN THE CITIES OF ASIA AND EVERY VICE WAS FOMENTED BY THE CELIBACY OF THE MONKS AND CLERGY
1815-143388-0003 JUSTINIAN RELAXED THE PUNISHMENT AT LEAST OF FEMALE INFIDELITY THE GUILTY SPOUSE WAS ONLY CONDEMNED TO SOLITUDE AND PENANCE
1815-143388-0004 BUT THE SAME EMPEROR DECLARED HIMSELF THE IMPLACABLE ENEMY OF UNMANLY LUST AND THE CRUELTY OF HIS PERSECUTION
1815-143388-0005 HE STRETCHED TO PAST AS WELL AS FUTURE OFFENCES THE OPERATIONS OF HIS EDICTS
1815-143388-0006 A PAINFUL DEATH WAS INFLICTED BY THE AMPUTATION OF THE SINFUL INSTRUMENT
1815-143388-0007 AND JUSTINIAN DEFENDED THE PROPRIETY OF THE EXECUTION
1815-143388-0008 IN THIS STATE OF DISGRACE AND AGONY TWO BISHOPS ISAIAH OF RHODES AND ALEXANDER OF DIOSPOLIS WERE DRAGGED THROUGH THE STREETS OF CONSTANTINOPLE
1815-143388-0009 TO OBSERVE THIS AWFUL LESSON AND NOT TO POLLUTE THE SANCTITY OF THEIR CHARACTER PERHAPS THESE PRELATES WERE INNOCENT A SENTENCE OF DEATH AND INFAMY WAS OFTEN FOUNDED ON THE SLIGHT AND SUSPICIOUS EVIDENCE OF A CHILD OR A SERVANT
1815-143388-0010 THE GUILT OF THE GREEN FACTION OF THE RICH AND OF THE ENEMIES OF THEODORA
1815-143388-0011 BUT THE SACRED RIGHT OF APPEAL SOON ABOLISHED THE JURISDICTION OF THE MAGISTRATES AND ALL PUBLIC CAUSES WERE DECIDED BY THE SUPREME TRIBUNAL OF THE PEOPLE BUT A WILD DEMOCRACY SUPERIOR TO THE FORMS
1815-143388-0012 TOO OFTEN DISDAINS THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE THE PRIDE OF DESPOTISM
1815-143388-0013 AND THE HEROES OF ATHENS MIGHT SOMETIMES APPLAUD THE HAPPINESS OF THE PERSIAN WHOSE FATE DEPENDED ON THE CAPRICE OF A SINGLE TYRANT SOME SALUTARY RESTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THE PEOPLE OR THEIR OWN PASSIONS
1815-143388-0014 THE RIGHT OF ACCUSATION WAS CONFINED TO THE MAGISTRATES A VOTE OF THE THIRTY FIVE TRIBES COULD INFLICT A FINE BUT THE COGNIZANCE OF ALL CAPITAL CRIMES WAS RESERVED BY A FUNDAMENTAL LAW TO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE CENTURIES IN WHICH THE WEIGHT OF INFLUENCE AND PROPERTY
1815-143388-0015 WAS SURE TO PREPONDERATE REPEATED PROCLAMATIONS AND ADJOURNMENTS WERE INTERPOSED TO ALLOW TIME FOR PREJUDICE AND RESENTMENT TO SUBSIDE THE WHOLE PROCEEDING MIGHT BE ANNULLED BY A SEASONABLE OMEN OR THE OPPOSITION OF A TRIBUNE
1815-143388-0016 AND SUCH POPULAR TRIALS WERE COMMONLY LESS FORMIDABLE TO INNOCENCE THAN THEY WERE FAVORABLE TO GUILT BUT THIS UNION OF THE JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE POWERS LEFT IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE ACCUSED PARTY WAS PARDONED OR ACQUITTED
1815-143388-0017 THE ORATORS OF ROME AND ATHENS ADDRESS THEIR ARGUMENTS TO THE POLICY AND BENEVOLENCE
1815-143388-0018 AS THE CITIZENS AND THE OFFENDERS CONTINUALLY MULTIPLIED
1815-143388-0019 OR TO EXTRAORDINARY INQUISITORS IN THE FIRST AGES THESE QUESTIONS WERE RARE AND OCCASIONAL IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTH CENTURY OF ROME THEY WERE MADE PERPETUAL
1815-143388-0020 FOUR PRAETORS WERE ANNUALLY EMPOWERED TO SIT IN JUDGMENT ON THE STATE OFFENCES OF TREASON EXTORTION PECULATION AND BRIBERY AND SYLLA ADDED NEW PRAETORS AND NEW QUESTIONS FOR THOSE CRIMES WHICH MORE DIRECTLY INJURE THE SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS
1815-143388-0021 BY THESE INQUISITORS THE TRIAL WAS PREPARED AND DIRECTED BUT THEY COULD ONLY PRONOUNCE THE SENTENCE OF THE MAJORITY OF JUDGES WHO WITH SOME TRUTH AND MORE PREJUDICE
1815-143388-0022 AN ANNUAL LIST OF ANCIENT AND RESPECTABLE CITIZENS WAS FORMED BY THE PRAETOR
1815-143388-0023 AND THE PEOPLE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY WERE APPOINTED FOR SINGLE QUESTIONS AND THE VARIOUS ROLLS OR DECURIES OF JUDGES
1815-143388-0024 IN EACH PARTICULAR CAUSE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER WAS DRAWN FROM THE URN THEIR INTEGRITY WAS GUARDED BY AN OATH THE MODE OF BALLOT SECURED THEIR INDEPENDENCE
1815-143388-0025 HE OFTEN REFERRED TO A DELEGATE THE DETERMINATION OF THE FACT WITH THE INCREASE OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THE TRIBUNAL OF THE CENTUMVIRS IN WHICH HE PRESIDED
1815-143388-0026 OR WITH THE ADVICE OF HIS COUNCIL THE MOST ABSOLUTE POWERS MIGHT BE TRUSTED TO A MAGISTRATE WHO WAS ANNUALLY CHOSEN BY THE VOTES OF THE PEOPLE THE RULES AND PRECAUTIONS OF FREEDOM HAVE REQUIRED SOME EXPLANATION THE ORDER OF DESPOTISM
1815-143388-0027 IS SIMPLE AND INANIMATE BEFORE THE AGE OF JUSTINIAN OR PERHAPS OF DIOCLETIAN
1815-143388-0028 AT LEAST TO HIS CHILDREN BY THIS CIVIL DEATH AND HE MIGHT STILL BE HAPPY IN EVERY RATIONAL AND SENSUAL ENJOYMENT
1815-143388-0029 COULD SUPPORT THE UNIFORMITY AND SILENCE OF RHODES OR ATHENS
1815-143388-0030 AND THE LEGAL ENCOURAGEMENTS OF SUICIDE THE BODIES OF CONDEMNED CRIMINALS WERE EXPOSED TO PUBLIC IGNOMINY AND THEIR CHILDREN A MORE SERIOUS EVIL WERE REDUCED TO POVERTY BY THE CONFISCATION OF THEIR FORTUNES
1815-143388-0031 BUT IF THE VICTIMS OF TIBERIUS AND NERO ANTICIPATED THE DECREE OF THE PRINCE OR SENATE THEIR COURAGE AND DESPATCH WERE RECOMPENSED BY THE APPLAUSE OF THE PUBLIC THE DECENT HONORS OF BURIAL
1815-143388-0032 APPEAR TO HAVE DEPRIVED THE UNFORTUNATE OF THIS LAST CONSOLATION
1815-143388-0033 A VOLUNTARY DEATH
1815-143388-0034 INTERVENED BETWEEN THE ACCUSATION AND THE SENTENCE
1815-143388-0035 WAS NEVER REVIVED OR IMITATED BY SUCCEEDING TYRANTS
1815-143388-0036 AND HIS ARM CAN ONLY BE RESTRAINED BY THE RELIGIOUS APPREHENSION OF A FUTURE STATE SUICIDES ARE ENUMERATED BY VIRGIL AMONG THE UNFORTUNATE
1815-143388-0037 THE LIFE OR DEATH OF A CITIZEN IS DETERMINED WITH LESS CAUTION OR DELAY THAN THE MOST ORDINARY QUESTION OF COVENANT OR INHERITANCE THIS SINGULAR DISTINCTION
1815-143388-0038 IS DERIVED FROM THE NATURE OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JURISPRUDENCE OUR DUTIES TO THE STATE ARE SIMPLE AND UNIFORM THE LAW BY WHICH HE IS CONDEMNED IS INSCRIBED NOT ONLY ON BRASS OR MARBLE BUT ON THE CONSCIENCE OF THE OFFENDER
1815-143388-0039 AND HIS GUILT IS COMMONLY PROVED BY THE TESTIMONY OF A SINGLE FACT BUT OUR RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER ARE VARIOUS AND INFINITE OUR OBLIGATIONS ARE CREATED ANNULLED AND MODIFIED BY INJURIES BENEFITS AND PROMISES
1815-143388-0040 AND THE INTERPRETATION OF VOLUNTARY CONTRACTS AND TESTAMENTS WHICH ARE OFTEN DICTATED BY FRAUD OR IGNORANCE AFFORDS A LONG AND LABORIOUS EXERCISE TO THE SAGACITY OF THE JUDGE THE BUSINESS OF LIFE IS MULTIPLIED BY THE EXTENT OF COMMERCE AND DOMINION
1815-143388-0041 AND THE RESIDENCE OF THE PARTIES IN THE DISTANT PROVINCES OF AN EMPIRE IS PRODUCTIVE OF DOUBT DELAY AND INEVITABLE APPEALS FROM THE LOCAL TO THE SUPREME MAGISTRATE JUSTINIAN THE GREEK EMPEROR OF CONSTANTINOPLE AND THE EAST
1815-143388-0042 WAS THE LEGAL SUCCESSOR OF THE LATIN SHEPHERD WHO HAD PLANTED A COLONY ON THE BANKS OF THE TYBER IN A PERIOD OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED YEARS THE LAWS HAD RELUCTANTLY FOLLOWED THE CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT AND MANNERS AND THE LAUDABLE DESIRE OF CONCILIATING ANCIENT NAMES WITH RECENT INSTITUTIONS
1815-143388-0043 DESTROYED THE HARMONY AND SWELLED THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OBSCURE AND IRREGULAR SYSTEM THE LAWS WHICH EXCUSE ON ANY OCCASIONS THE IGNORANCE OF THEIR SUBJECTS CONFESS THEIR OWN IMPERFECTIONS THE CIVIL JURISPRUDENCE
1815-143388-0044 STILL CONTINUED A MYSTERIOUS SCIENCE AND A PROFITABLE TRADE AND THE INNATE PERPLEXITY OF THE STUDY WAS INVOLVED IN TENFOLD DARKNESS BY THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY OF THE PRACTITIONERS THE EXPENSE OF THE PURSUIT SOMETIMES EXCEEDED THE VALUE OF THE PRIZE
1815-143388-0045 AND THE FAIREST RIGHTS WERE ABANDONED BY THE POVERTY OR PRUDENCE OF THE CLAIMANTS SUCH COSTLY JUSTICE MIGHT TEND TO ABATE THE SPIRIT OF LITIGATION BUT THE UNEQUAL PRESSURE SERVES ONLY TO INCREASE THE INFLUENCE OF THE RICH
1815-143388-0046 AND TO AGGRAVATE THE MISERY OF THE POOR BY THESE DILATORY AND EXPENSIVE PROCEEDINGS THE WEALTHY PLEADER OBTAINS A MORE CERTAIN ADVANTAGE THAN HE COULD HOPE FROM THE ACCIDENTAL CORRUPTION OF HIS JUDGE THE EXPERIENCE OF AN ABUSE
1815-143388-0047 FROM WHICH OUR OWN AGE AND COUNTRY ARE NOT PERFECTLY EXEMPT MAY SOMETIMES PROVOKE A GENEROUS INDIGNATION AND EXTORT THE HASTY WISH OF EXCHANGING OUR ELABORATE JURISPRUDENCE
1815-143388-0048 OUR CALMER REFLECTION WILL SUGGEST THAT SUCH FORMS AND DELAYS ARE NECESSARY TO GUARD THE PERSON AND PROPERTY OF THE CITIZEN THAT THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE IS THE FIRST ENGINE OF TYRANNY AND THAT THE LAWS OF A FREE PEOPLE
1815-143388-0049 SHOULD FORESEE AND DETERMINE EVERY QUESTION THAT MAY PROBABLY ARISE IN THE EXERCISE OF POWER
1815-143388-0050 BUT THE GOVERNMENT OF JUSTINIAN UNITED THE EVILS OF LIBERTY AND SERVITUDE
