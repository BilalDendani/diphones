9000-282380-0000 CHAPTER TWO THE PROSPECTOR BY SEPTEMBER WHEN MOUNTAIN RIVERS ARE AT THEIR LOWEST EVERY BAR ON THE FRASER FROM YALE TO THE FORKS OF THE THOMPSON WAS OCCUPIED
9000-282380-0001 THE HUDSON'S BAY STEAMER OTTER MADE REGULAR TRIPS UP THE FRASER TO FORT LANGLEY AND FROM THE FORT AN AMERICAN STEAMER CALLED THE ENTERPRISE OWNED BY CAPTAIN TOM WRIGHT BREASTED THE WATERS AS FAR AS THE SWIFT CURRENT AT YALE
9000-282380-0002 AT YALE WAS A CITY OF TENTS AND HUNGRY MEN WALTER MOBERLY TELLS HOW WHEN HE ASCENDED THE FRASER WITH WRIGHT IN THE AUTUMN OF FIFTY EIGHT
9000-282380-0003 THE GENEROUS YANKEE CAPTAIN WAS MOBBED BY PENNILESS AND DESTITUTE MEN FOR RETURN PASSAGE TO THE COAST MANY A BROKEN TREASURE SEEKER OWED HIS LIFE TO TOM WRIGHT'S FREE PASSAGE FORTUNATELY THERE WAS ALWAYS GOOD FISHING ON THE FRASER
9000-282380-0004 BUT SALT WAS A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE A POUND BUTTER A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE A POUND AND FLOUR RARER THAN NUGGETS
9000-282380-0005 THAT ONE DESPERATE FELLOW WENT TO A LOG SHACK CALLED A GROCERY STORE AND AFTER PAYING A DOLLAR FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF USING A GRINDSTONE BOUGHT AN EMPTY BUTTER VAT AT THE POUND PRICE OF BUTTER TWELVE DOLLARS FOR AN EMPTY BUTTER TUB
9000-282380-0006 HALF A DOLLAR WAS THE SMALLEST COIN USED AND CLOTHING WAS SO SCARCE THAT WHEN A CHINAMAN'S PIG CHEWED UP WALTER MOBERLY'S BOOTS WHILE THE SURVEYOR LAY ASLEEP IN HIS SHACK MISTER MOBERLY HAD TO FOOT IT TWENTY FIVE MILES BEFORE HE COULD FIND ANOTHER PAIR OF BOOTS
9000-282380-0007 SALOONS OCCUPIED EVERY SECOND SHACK AT YALE AND HOPE REVOLVERS WERE IN ALL BELTS AND EACH MAN WAS HIS OWN SHERIFF YET THERE WAS LITTLE LAWLESSNESS WITH CLAIMS FILED ON ALL GOLD BEARING BARS
9000-282380-0008 WHAT WERE THE TEN THOUSAND MEN TO DO CAMPED FOR FIFTY MILES BEYOND YALE THOSE WHO HAD NO PROVISIONS AND COULD NOT INDUCE ANY STOREKEEPER TO GRUBSTAKE THEM FOR A WINTER'S PROSPECTING QUIT THE COUNTRY IN DISGUST
9000-282380-0009 AND THE PRICE OF LAND DROPPED IN THE BOOM TOWNS OF THE FRASER AS SWIFTLY AS IT HAD BEEN BALLOONED UP PROSPECTING DURING THE WINTER IN A COUNTRY OF HEAVY SNOWFALL DID NOT SEEM A SANE PROJECT AND YET THE ETERNAL QUESTION URGED THE MINERS ON
9000-282380-0010 GOLD HAD ALSO BEEN FOUND IN CRACKS IN THE ROCK ALONG THE RIVER WHENCE HAD IT COME THE MAN FARTHEST UPSTREAM IN SPRING WOULD BE ON THE GROUND FIRST FOR THE GREAT FIND THAT WAS BOUND TO MAKE SOME SEEKER'S FORTUNE SO ALL STAYED WHO COULD
9000-282380-0011 THE AUTUMN LATE THE SNOWFALL LIGHT AND THE SPRING VERY EARLY FATE AS USUAL FAVOURED THE DAUNTLESS IN PARTIES OF TWOS AND TENS AND TWENTIES AND EVEN AS MANY AS FIVE HUNDRED
9000-282380-0012 THE MINERS BEGAN MOVING UP THE RIVER PROSPECTING THOSE WITH HORSES HAD LITERALLY TO CUT THE WAY WITH THEIR AXES OVER WINDFALL OVER STEEP BANKS AND ROUND PRECIPITOUS CLIFFS WHERE RIVERS HAD TO BE CROSSED
9000-282380-0013 THE MEN BUILT RUDE RAFTS AND POLED THEMSELVES OVER WITH THEIR PACK HORSES SWIMMING BEHIND THOSE WHO HAD OXEN KILLED THE OXEN AND SOLD THE BEEF OTHERS BREASTED THE MILL RACE OF THE FRASER IN CANOES AND DUGOUTS
9000-282380-0014 GOVERNOR DOUGLAS ESTIMATED THAT BEFORE APRIL OF FIFTY NINE AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED BOATS WITH FIVE MEN IN EACH HAD ASCENDED THE FRASER SOMETIMES THE AMAZING SPECTACLE WAS SEEN OF CANOES LASHED TOGETHER IN THE FASHION OF PONTOON BRIDGES
9000-282380-0015 THESE TRAVELLERS NATURALLY DID NOT ATTEMPT FRASER CANYON BEFORE CHRISTMAS OF FIFTY NINE PROSPECTORS HAD SPREAD INTO LILLOOET AND UP THE RIVER AS HIGH AS CHILCOTIN SODA CREEK ALEXANDRIA COTTONWOOD CANYON
9000-282380-0016 QUESNEL AND FORT GEORGE IT WAS SAFER TO ASCEND SUCH WILD STREAMS THAN TO RUN WITH THE CURRENT THOUGH COUNTLESS CANOES AND THEIR OCCUPANTS WERE NEVER HEARD OF AFTER LEAVING YALE WHERE THE TURBID YELLOW FLOOD BEGAN TO RISE AND COLLECT'
9000-282380-0017 A BOATMAN'S PHRASE THE MEN WOULD SCRAMBLE ASHORE AND BY MEANS OF A LONG TUMP LINE TIED NOT TO THE PROW WHICH WOULD SEND HER SIDLING TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST THWART WOULD TOW THEIR CRAFT SLOWLY UP STREAM
9000-282380-0018 I HAVE PASSED UP AND DOWN FRASER CANYON TOO OFTEN TO COUNT THE TIMES AND HAVE CANOED ONE WILD RAPID TWICE BUT NEVER WITHOUT WONDERING HOW THOSE FIRST GOLD SEEKERS MANAGED THE ASCENT IN THAT WINTER OF FIFTY NINE THERE WAS NO CARIBOO ROAD THEN
9000-282380-0019 THERE WAS ONLY THE NARROW FOOTPATH OF THE TRAPPER AND THE FISHERMAN CLOSE DOWN TO THE WATER AND WHEN THE ROCKS BROKE OFF IN SHEER PRECIPICE AN UNSTEADY BRIDGE OF POLES AND WILLOWS SPANNED THE ABYSS
9000-282380-0020 WAS ONE THING FOR THE INDIAN MOCCASIN AND QUITE ANOTHER THING FOR THE MINER'S HOBNAILED BOOT THE MEN USED TO STRIP AT THESE PLACES AND ATTEMPT THE ROCK WALLS BAREFOOT OR ELSE THEY CACHED THEIR CANOE IN A TREE OR HID IT UNDER MOSS LASHED WHAT PROVISIONS THEY COULD TO A DOG'S BACK
9000-282380-0021 THE TRAPPER CARRIES HIS PACK WITH A STRAP ROUND HIS FOREHEAD THE MINER ROPES HIS ROUND UNDER HIS SHOULDERS HE WANTS HANDS AND NECK FREE FOR CLIMBING USUALLY THE PROSPECTORS WOULD APPOINT A RENDEZVOUS
9000-282380-0022 THERE PROVISIONS WOULD BE SLUNG IN THE TREES ABOVE THE REACH OF MARAUDING BEASTS AND THE PARTY WOULD DISPERSE AT DAYBREAK EACH TO SEARCH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION BLAZING TREES AS HE WENT AHEAD SO THAT HE COULD FIND THE WAY BACK AT NIGHT TO THE CAMP
9000-282380-0023 DISTRESS OR A FIND WAS TO BE SIGNALLED BY A GUNSHOT OR BY HELIOGRAPH OF SUNLIGHT ON A POCKET MIRROR BUT MANY A MAN STRAYED BEYOND RESCUE OF SIGNAL AND NEVER RETURNED TO HIS WAITING PARDNERS
9000-282380-0024 SOME WERE CAUGHT IN SNOWSLIDES ONLY TO BE DUG OUT YEARS LATER MANY SIGNS GUIDED THE EXPERIENCED PROSPECTOR STREAMS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL CAME HE KNEW FROM UPPER SNOWS
9000-282380-0025 STREAMS MILKY OR BLUE OR PEACOCK GREEN CAME FROM GLACIERS ICE GRINDING OVER ROCK HEAVY MISTS OFTEN ADDED TO THE DANGERS
9000-282380-0026 I STOOD AT THE LEVEL OF EIGHT THOUSAND FEET IN THIS REGION ONCE WITH ONE OF THE OLDEST PROSPECTORS OF THE CANYON HE HAD BEEN A GREAT HUNTER IN HIS DAY A CLOUD CAME THROUGH A DEFILE OF THE PEAKS HEAVY AS A BLANKET
9000-282380-0027 THOUGH WE WERE ON A WELL CUT BRIDLE TRAIL HE BADE US PAUSE AS ONE SIDE OF THE TRAIL HAD A SHEER DROP OF FOUR THOUSAND FEET IN PLACES BEFORE THERE WERE ANY TRAILS
9000-282380-0028 HOW DID YOU MAKE YOUR WAY HERE TO HUNT THE MOUNTAIN GOAT WHEN THIS KIND OF FOG CAUGHT YOU I ASKED THREW CHIPS OF STONE AHEAD AND LISTENED HE ANSWERED AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT ONLY THE GREENEST KIND OF TENDERFOOT EVER TAKES RISKS ON A PRECIPICE
9000-282380-0029 WHEN FIVE THOUSAND PROSPECTORS OVERRAN THE WILD CANYONS AND PRECIPICES OF THE FRASER TWO OR THREE THINGS THE PROSPECTOR ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM MATCHES A KNIFE A GUN RICE FLOUR BACON
9000-282380-0030 AND A LITTLE MALLET SHAPED HAMMER TO TEST THE FLOAT WHAT WAS THE FLOAT A SANDY CHUNK OF GRAVEL
9000-282380-0031 HE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THAT CHUNK ROLLED DOWN FROM HE KNOCKED IT OPEN WITH HIS MALLET IF IT HAD A SHINY YELLOW PEBBLE INSIDE ONLY THE SIZE OF A PEA THE MINER WOULD STAY ON THAT BANK AND BEGIN BENCH DIGGINGS INTO THE DRY BANK
9000-282380-0032 BY THE SPRING OF FIFTY NINE DRY BENCH DIGGINGS HAD EXTENDED BACK FIFTY MILES FROM THE RIVER IF THE CHUNK REVEALED ONLY TINY YELLOW SPECKS PERHAPS MIXED WITH WHITE QUARTZ THE MINER WOULD TRY TO FIND WHERE IT ROLLED FROM
9000-282380-0033 AND WOULD ASCEND THE GULLY OR MOUNTAIN TORRENT OR PRECIPICE QUEER STORIES ARE TOLD OF HOW DURING THAT WINTER ALMOST BANKRUPT GROCERS GRUBSTAKED PROSPECTORS WITH BACON AND FLOUR
9000-282380-0034 AND RECEIVED A HALF INTEREST IN A MINE THAT YIELDED FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY IN NUGGETS BUT FOR ONE WHO FOUND A MINE A THOUSAND FOUND NOTHING THE SENSATIONS OF THE LUCKY ONE BEGGARED DESCRIPTION WAS IT LUCK OR WAS IT PERSEVERANCE
9000-282380-0035 I ASKED THE MAN WHO FOUND ONE OF THE RICHEST SILVER MINES IN THE BIG BEND OF THE COLUMBIA BOTH AND MOSTLY DOGGED HE ANSWERED TAKE OUR PARTY AS A TYPE OF PROSPECTORS FROM FIFTY NINE TO EIGHTY NINE
9000-282380-0036 FROM WASHINGTON WE HAD ROUGHED IT IN EAST AND WEST KOOTENAY AND WERE WORKING SOUTH TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY DEAD BROKE WE HAD FOUND FLOAT IN PLENTY AND HAD FOLLOWED IT UP RIDGES AND OVER DIVIDES ACROSS THREE RANGES OF MOUNTAINS
9000-282380-0037 OUR HORSES WERE PLUMB PLAYED OUT WE HAD CAMPED ON A RIDGE TO LET THEM FATTEN UP ENOUGH TO BEAT IT OUT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA FOR EVER WELL WE FOUND SOME GALENA FLOATS IN A DRY GULLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY
9000-282380-0038 SOME OF THE BOYS SAID THEY WOULD GO OUT AND SHOOT ENOUGH DEER TO LAST US FOR MEAT TILL WE COULD GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY OLD SANDY AND I THOUGHT WE WOULD TRY OUR LUCK FOR JUST ONE DAY WE FOLLOWED THAT FLOAT CLEAR ACROSS THE VALLEY WE FOUND MORE
9000-282380-0039 UP THE BED OF A RAGING MOUNTAIN TORRENT BUT THE TROUBLE WAS THAT THE STREAM CAME OVER A ROCK SHEER AS THE WALL OF A HOUSE I WAS AFRAID WE'D LOSE THE DIRECTION IF WE LEFT THE STREAM BED BUT I COULD SEE HIGH UP THE PRECIPICE WHERE IT WIDENED OUT IN A BENCH
9000-282380-0040 YOU COULDN'T REACH IT FROM BELOW BUT YOU COULD FROM ABOVE SO WE BLAZED THE TREES BELOW TO KEEP OUR DIRECTION AND STARTED UP ROUND THE HOG'S BACK TO DROP TO THE BANK UNDER
9000-282380-0041 OLD SANDY WANTED TO GO BACK BUT I WOULDN'T LET HIM HE WAS TREMBLING LIKE AN ASPEN LEAF IT IS SO OFTEN JUST THE ONE PACE MORE THAT WINS OR LOSES THE RACE WE LABOURED UP THAT SLOPE AND REACHED THE BENCH JUST AT DARK
9000-282380-0042 WE WERE SO TIRED WE HAD HAULED OURSELVES UP BY TREES BRUSHWOOD BRANCHES ANYTHING I LOOKED OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROCK IT DROPPED TO THAT SHELF WE HAD SEEN FROM THE GULLY BELOW IT WAS TOO DARK TO DO ANYTHING MORE
9000-282380-0043 HOW FAR I ASKED ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILES WE THREW OURSELVES DOWN TO SLEEP IT WAS TERRIBLY COLD WE WERE HIGH UP AND THE FALL FROSTS WERE ICY I TELL YOU I WOKE ACHING AT DAYBREAK
9000-282380-0044 OLD SANDY WAS STILL SLEEPING I THOUGHT I WOULD LET MYSELF DOWN OVER THE LEDGE AND SEE WHAT WAS BELOW FOR THERE WERE NO MINERAL SIGNS WHERE WE WERE
9000-282380-0045 TO A SOFT GRASSY LEVEL I LOOKED HUNG FOR A MOMENT LET GO AND LIT ON ALL FOURS THEN I LOOKED UP THE SUN HAD JUST COME OVER THAT EAST RIDGE AND HIT THE ROCKS
9000-282380-0046 I WENT MAD I LAUGHED I CRIED I HOWLED THERE WASN'T AN ACHE LEFT IN MY BONES I FORGOT THAT MY KNEES KNOCKED FROM WEAKNESS AND THAT WE HAD NOT HAD A BITE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS I YELLED AT OLD SANDY TO WAKE THE DEAD
9000-282380-0047 HE CAME CRAWLING OVER THE LEDGE AND PEEKED DOWN WHAT'S THE MATTER SAYS HE MATTER I YELLED WAKE UP YOU OLD SON OF A GUN WE ARE MILLIONAIRES THERE STICKING RIGHT OUT OF THE ROCK
9000-282380-0048 WAS THE LEDGE WHERE FLOAT HAD BEEN BREAKING AND WASHING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS SO YOU SEE ONLY ELEVEN DAYS FROM THE TIME WE WERE GOING TO GIVE UP WE MADE OUR FIND THAT MINE PAID FROM THE FIRST LOAD OF ORE SENT OUT BY PACK HORSES
9000-282380-0049 OTHER MINES WERE FOUND IN A LESS SPECTACULAR WAY THE FLOAT LOST ITSELF IN A ROUNDED KNOLL IN THE LAP OF A DOZEN PEAKS AND THE MINERS HAD TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE BENCHES TO TUNNEL
9000-282380-0050 THEY MIGHT HAVE TO BRING THE STREAM FROM MILES DISTANT TO SLUICE OUT THE GRAVEL AND THE LARGEST NUGGETS MIGHT NOT BE FOUND TILL HUNDREDS OF FEET HAD BEEN WASHED OUT BUT ALWAYS THE FLOAT THE PEBBLES THE SPECKS THAT SHONE IN THE SUN LURED THEM WITH PROMISE
9000-282380-0051 EVEN FOR THOSE WHO FOUND NO MINE THE SEARCH WAS NOT WITHOUT REWARD
9000-282380-0052 THERE WAS THE LURE OF HOPE EDGING EVERY SUNRISE THERE WAS THE FRESH WASHED OZONE FRAGRANT WITH THE RESINOUS EXUDATIONS OF THE GREAT TREES OF THE FOREST THERE WAS THE HEALING REGENERATION TO BODY AND SOUL
9000-282380-0053 AMID THE DANCE HALLS AND SALOONS THE MINER WITH MONEY BECOMES A SOT OUT IN THE WILDS HE BECOMES A CHILD OF NATURE SIMPLE AND CLEAN AND ELEMENTAL AS THE TREES AROUND HIM OR THE STARS ABOVE HIM
9000-282380-0054 I THINK OF ONE PROSPECTOR WHOSE RANGE WAS AT THE HEADWATERS OF THE ATHABASKA IN THE DANCE HALLS HE HAD MARRIED A CHEAP VARIETY ACTRESS WHEN THE MONEY OF HIS FIRST FIND HAD BEEN DISSIPATED SHE REFUSED TO LIVE WITH HIM
9000-282380-0055 AND TRIED TO EXTORT HIGH ALIMONY BY CLAIMING THEIR TWO YEAR OLD SON THE PENNILESS PROSPECTOR KNEW THAT HE WAS NO EQUAL FOR LAW COURTS AND SHERIFFS AND LAWYERS SO HE MADE HIM A RAFT GOT A LOCAL TRADER TO OUTFIT HIM
9000-282380-0056 AND PLUNGED WITH HIS BABY BOY INTO THE WILDERNESS WHERE NO SHERIFF COULD TRACK HIM I ASKED HIM WHY HE DID NOT USE PACK HORSES HE SAID DOGS COULD HAVE TRACKED THEM BUT THE WATER DIDN'T LEAVE NO SMELL
9000-282380-0057 IN THE HEART OF THE WILDERNESS WEST OF MOUNTS BROWN AND HOOKER HE BUILT HIM A LOG CABIN WITH A FIREPLACE
9000-282380-0058 HE SET HIS TRAPS ROUND THE MOUNTAINS AND HUNTED TILL THE SNOW CLEARED BY THE TIME HE COULD GO PROSPECTING IN SPRING HE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF FURS TO SELL
9000-282380-0059 THEN HE BROUGHT THE BOY DOWN AND SENT HIM TO SCHOOL WHEN THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY CROSSED THE ROCKIES THAT MAN BECAME ONE OF THE FAMOUS GUIDES HE WAS THE FIRST GUIDE I EVER EMPLOYED IN THE MOUNTAINS
9000-282380-0060 UP STREAM THEN HEADED THE PROSPECTORS ON THE FRASER IN THAT AUTUMN OF FIFTY EIGHT THE MINER'S TRAIN OF PACK HORSES IS A STUDY IN NATURE THERE IS ALWAYS THE WISE OLD BELL MARE LEADING THE WAY
9000-282380-0061 THERE IS ALWAYS THE LAZY PACKER THAT HAS TO BE NIPPED BY THE HORSE BEHIND HIM THERE ARE ALWAYS THE SHANKY COLTS WHO BOLT TO STAMPEDE WHERE THE TRAIL WIDENS BUT EVEN SHANKY LEGGED COLTS LEARN TO KEEP IN LINE IN THE WILDS AT EVERY STEEP ASCENT THE PACK TRAIN HALTS
9000-282380-0062 GIRTHS ARE TIGHTENED AND SLY OLD HORSES BLOW OUT THEIR SIDES TO DECEIVE THE DRIVER AT FIRST COLTS TRY TO RUB PACKS OFF ON EVERY PASSING TREE BUT A FEW TUMBLES HEELS OVER HEAD DOWN A BANK CURE THEM OF THAT TRICK
9000-282380-0063 RIVER BANK IS FOLLOWED WHERE POSSIBLE BUT WHERE WINDFALL OR PRECIPICE DRIVES BACK FROM THE BED OF THE RIVER OVER THE MOUNTAIN SPURS THE PATHFINDER TAKES HIS BEARINGS FROM COUNTLESS SIGNS MOSS IS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF TREE TRUNKS
9000-282380-0064 A STEEP SLOPE COMPELS A ZIGZAG CORKSCREW ASCENT BUT THE SLOPE OF THE GROUND GUIDES THE CLIMBER AS TO THE WAY TO GO FOR SLOPE MEANS VALLEY AND IN VALLEYS ARE STREAMS AND IN THE STREAM IS THE FLOAT
9000-282380-0065 WHICH IS TO THE PROSPECTOR THE ONE SHINING SIGNAL TO BE FOLLOWED TIMBER LINE IS PASSED TILL THE FORESTS BELOW LOOK LIKE DANK BANKS OF MOSS CLOUD LINE IS PASSED TILL THE CLOUDS LIE UNDERNEATH IN GREY LAKES AND POOLS
9000-282380-0066 A FOOL HEN OR MOUNTAIN GROUSE COMES OUT AND BOBBLES HER HEAD AT THE PASSING PACKTRAIN A WHISTLING MARMOT POPS UP FROM THE ROCKS AND PIERCES THE STILLNESS
9000-282380-0067 AND THUS GAVE THE GREAT GOLD AREA ITS NAME THE POPULATION OF YALE THAT WINTER CONSISTED OF SOME EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE HOUSED IN TENTS AND LOG SHACKS ROOFED WITH CANVAS BETWEEN YALE AND HOPE REMAINED TWO THOUSAND MINERS DURING THE WINTER
9000-282380-0068 MEALS COST A DOLLAR SERVED ON TIN PLATES TO DINERS STANDING IN LONG ROWS WAITING TURN AT THE COUNTER THE REGULAR MENU AT ALL MEALS WAS BACON SALMON BREAD AND COFFEE OF BUTTER THERE WAS LITTLE
9000-282380-0069 OF MILK NONE WHEREVER A SAND BAR GAVE SIGNS OF MINERAL IT WAS TESTED WITH THE PRIMITIVE FRYING PAN IF THE PAN SHOWED A DEPOSIT THE MINER RIGGED UP A ROCKER A CONTRAPTION RESEMBLING A CRADLE WITH ROCKERS BELOW
9000-282380-0070 ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM END TO END TWO FEET ACROSS AND TWO DEEP THE SIDES CONVERGED TO BOTTOM AT THE HEAD WAS A PERFORATED SHEET IRON BOTTOM LIKE A HOUSEWIFE'S COLANDER INTO THIS BOX THE GRAVEL WAS SHOVELLED BY ONE MINER
9000-282380-0071 THE MAN'S PARDNER POURED IN WATER AND ROCKED THE CRADLE CRADLED THE SAND
9000-282380-0072 WHEN STREAMS WERE DIRECTED THROUGH WOODEN BOXES THE GOLD WAS SLUICED ON A STILL LARGER SCALE THE PROCESS WAS HYDRAULIC MINING THOUGH THE SAME IN PRINCIPLE
9000-282380-0073 THE PROCESS IS ONLY A COMPLEX REFINEMENT OF THE BAR WASHER CRADLING HIS GOLD FIRES HAD NOT YET CLEARED THE GIANT HEMLOCK FORESTS AS THEY HAVE TO DAY ALONG THE CARIBOO TRAIL
9000-282380-0074 AND PROSPECTORS FOUND THEIR WAY THROUGH A CHARTLESS SEA OF WINDFALL HEMLOCKS CRISS CROSSED THE HEIGHT OF A HOUSE WITH BRANCHES INTERLACED LIKE WIRE CATARACTS FELL OVER LOFTY LEDGES IN WIND BLOWN SPRAY SPANISH MOSS
9000-282380-0075 GREY GREEN AND FEATHERY HUNG FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH OF THE HUGE DOUGLAS FIRS SOMETIMES THE TRAIL WOULD LEAD FOR MILES ROUND THE EDGE OF SOME PRECIPICES BEYOND WHICH COULD BE GLIMPSED THE ETERNAL SNOWS
9000-282380-0076 SOMETIMES AN AVALANCHE SLID OVER A SLOPE WITH THE DISTANT APPEARANCE OF A GREAT WHITE WATERFALL AND THE ECHO OF MUFFLED THUNDER
9000-282380-0077 FOR IN AN INSTANT THE SNOWSLIDE MIGHT COME OVER THE EDGE OF THE UPPER VALLEY TO SWEEP DOWN THE SLOPE CARRYING AWAY FORESTS ROCKS TRAIL PACK TRAIN AND ALL THE STORY IS TOLD OF ONE SLIDE SEEN BY THE GUIDE AT THE HEAD OF A LONG PACK TRAIN
9000-282380-0078 HE HAD JUDGED IT TO BE TEN MILES AWAY BUT OUT FROM THE UPPER VALLEY IT CAME COILING LIKE A LONG WHITE SNAKE AND BEFORE HE COULD TURN IT HAD CAUGHT HIM IN A SLIDE DEATH WAS ALMOST CERTAIN
9000-282380-0079 FROM SUFFOCATION IF NOT FROM THE CRUSH OF FALLING TREES AND ROCKS MINERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THEIR CABINS DEAD IN THE TRAIL OF A SNOWSLIDE THAT SWEPT THE SHACK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF THEIR HEADS BEING INJURED
9000-282380-0080 THOUGH THE LOGS WERE TWISTED AND WARPED THE DEAD BODIES WERE NOT EVEN BRUISED WHEN A HUSHED WHISPER CAME THROUGH THE TREES TRAVELLERS LOOKED FOR SOME WATERFALL AT MIDDAY WHEN THE THAW WAS AT ITS FULL
9000-282380-0081 ALL THE MOUNTAIN TORRENTS BECAME VOCAL WITH THE GLEE OF DISIMPRISONED LIFE RUNNING A RACE OF GLADNESS TO THE SEA THE SUN SETS EARLY IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH A GRADUAL HUSHING OF THE VOICE OF GLAD WATERS AND A RED GLOW AS OF WINE ON THE ENCIRCLING PEAKS
9000-282380-0082 CAMP FOR THE NIGHT WAS ALWAYS NEAR WATER FOR THE HORSES
9000-282380-0083 SUNRISE STEALS IN SILENCE AMONG THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS THERE IS NONE OF THAT STIR OF SONG AND VAGUE RUSTLING OF ANIMAL LIFE SUCH AS ARE HEARD AT LOWER LEVELS NOR DOES THE LIGHT GRADUALLY RISE ABOVE THE EASTERN HORIZON
9000-282380-0084 THE WALLED PEAKS CUT OFF THE SKYLINE IN MID HEAVEN THE STARS PALE TREES AND CRAGS ARE MIRRORED IN THE LAKE SO CLEARLY THAT ONE CAN BARELY TELL WHICH IS REAL AND WHICH IS REFLECTION THEN THE WATER LINES SHORTEN
9000-282380-0085 AND THE ROCKS EMERGE FROM THE BELTS AND WISPS OF MIST AND ALL THE SUNSET COLOURS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE REPEAT THEMSELVES ACROSS THE CHANGING SCENE AS YOU LOOK THE CLOUDS LIFT THE COOK SHOUTS BREAKFAST AND IT IS ANOTHER DAY
