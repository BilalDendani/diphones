7649-96667-0000 THE DEPARTURE FROM LEMNOS A DAY CAME
7649-96667-0001 AND WENT ON THE LEMNIAN LAND HE GATHERED THE HEROES ABOUT HIM AND THEY SEEING HERACLES COME AMONGST THEM CLAMORED TO GO TO HUNT THE WILD BULLS THAT WERE INLAND FROM THE SEA SO FOR ONCE
7649-96667-0002 THE HEROES LEFT THE LEMNIAN MAIDENS WHO WERE THEIR FRIENDS
7649-96667-0003 AND WENT WITH HERACLES AND AS THEY WENT HERACLES SPOKE TO EACH OF THE HEROES SAYING THAT THEY WERE FORGETTING THE FLEECE OF GOLD THAT THEY HAD SAILED TO GAIN JASON BLUSHED TO THINK THAT HE HAD ALMOST LET GO OUT OF HIS MIND
7649-96667-0004 THE QUEST THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM FROM IOLCUS
7649-96667-0005 AND OF HOW HER LITTLE HAND WOULD STAY IN HIS AND HIS OWN HAND BECAME LOOSE UPON THE SPEAR SO THAT IT NEARLY FELL FROM HIM HOW COULD HE HE THOUGHT
7649-96667-0006 HE HEARD THE CLEAR VOICE OF ATALANTA AS SHE TOO SPOKE TO THE ARGONAUTS WHAT HERACLES SAID WAS BRAVE AND WISE SAID ATALANTA FORGETFULNESS WOULD COVER THEIR NAMES IF THEY STAYED LONGER IN LEMNOS FORGETFULNESS AND SHAME
7649-96667-0007 AND THEY WOULD COME TO DESPISE THEMSELVES LEAVE LEMNOS SHE CRIED AND DRAW ARGO INTO THE SEA AND DEPART FOR COLCHIS ALL DAY THE ARGONAUTS STAYED BY THEMSELVES HUNTING THE BULLS
7649-96667-0008 ON THEIR WAY BACK FROM THE CHASE THEY WERE MET BY LEMNIAN MAIDENS WHO CARRIED WREATHS OF FLOWERS FOR THEM VERY SILENT WERE THE HEROES AS THE MAIDENS GREETED THEM HERACLES WENT WITH JASON TO THE PALACE
7649-96667-0009 SEATED HERSELF NOT ON THE COUCH WHERE SHE WAS WONT TO SIT LOOKING INTO THE FACE OF JASON BUT ON THE STONE THRONE OF KING THOAS HER FATHER AND SEATED ON THAT THRONE SHE SPOKE TO JASON AND TO HERACLES
7649-96667-0010 AS A QUEEN MIGHT SPEAK IN THE HALL THAT NIGHT
7649-96667-0011 A STORY WAS TOLD CASTOR BEGAN IT AND POLYDEUCES ENDED IT AND THE STORY THAT HELEN'S BROTHERS TOLD WAS THE GOLDEN MAID EPIMETHEUS THE TITAN HAD A BROTHER WHO WAS THE WISEST OF ALL BEINGS
7649-96667-0012 PROMETHEUS CALLED THE FORESEER BUT EPIMETHEUS HIMSELF WAS SLOW WITTED AND SCATTER BRAINED HIS WISE BROTHER ONCE SENT HIM A MESSAGE BIDDING HIM BEWARE OF THE GIFTS THAT ZEUS MIGHT SEND HIM EPIMETHEUS HEARD
7649-96667-0013 BUT HE DID NOT HEED THE WARNING AND THEREBY HE BROUGHT UPON THE RACE OF MEN TROUBLES AND CARES PROMETHEUS THE WISE TITAN HAD SAVED MEN FROM A GREAT TROUBLE THAT ZEUS WOULD HAVE BROUGHT UPON THEM ALSO
7649-96667-0014 ZEUS WAS THE MORE WROTH WITH MEN NOW BECAUSE FIRE STOLEN FROM HIM HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM HE WAS WROTH WITH THE RACE OF TITANS TOO AND HE PONDERED IN HIS HEART HOW HE MIGHT INJURE MEN AND HOW HE MIGHT USE EPIMETHEUS
7649-96667-0015 THE MINDLESS TITAN TO FURTHER HIS PLAN WHILE HE PONDERED THERE WAS A HUSH ON HIGH OLYMPUS THE MOUNTAIN OF THE GODS THEN ZEUS CALLED UPON THE ARTISAN OF THE GODS LAME HEPHAESTUS
7649-96667-0016 AND HE COMMANDED HIM TO MAKE A BEING OUT OF CLAY THAT WOULD HAVE THE LIKENESS OF A LOVELY MAIDEN WITH JOY AND PRIDE HEPHAESTUS WORKED AT THE TASK THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM AND HE FASHIONED A BEING THAT HAD THE LIKENESS OF A LOVELY MAIDEN
7649-96667-0017 ALL STROVE TO ADD A GRACE OR A BEAUTY TO THE WORK OF HEPHAESTUS ZEUS
7649-96667-0018 SHOULD SEE AND FEEL ATHENE DRESSED HER IN GARMENTS THAT WERE AS LOVELY AS FLOWERS APHRODITE THE GODDESS OF LOVE PUT A CHARM ON HER LIPS AND IN HER EYES THE GRACES PUT NECKLACES AROUND HER NECK
7649-96667-0019 AND SET A GOLDEN CROWN UPON HER HEAD THE HOURS BROUGHT HER A GIRDLE OF SPRING FLOWERS THEN THE HERALD OF THE GODS GAVE HER SPEECH THAT WAS SWEET AND FLOWING ALL THE GODS AND GODDESSES HAD GIVEN GIFTS TO HER
7649-96667-0020 AND FOR THAT REASON THE MAIDEN OF HEPHAESTUS'S MAKING WAS CALLED PANDORA THE ALL ENDOWED SHE WAS LOVELY THE GODS KNEW
7649-96667-0021 BUT LOVELY AS FLOWERS AND BRIGHT WATERS AND EARTHLY MAIDENS ARE LOVELY ZEUS SMILED TO HIMSELF WHEN HE LOOKED UPON HER AND HE CALLED TO HERMES WHO KNEW ALL THE WAYS OF THE EARTH AND HE PUT HER INTO THE CHARGE OF HERMES
7649-96667-0022 ALSO HE GAVE HERMES A GREAT JAR TO TAKE ALONG THIS JAR WAS PANDORA'S DOWER
7649-96667-0023 NOW ONE DAY AS HE WAS SITTING ON A FALLEN PILLAR IN THE RUINED PLACE THAT WAS NOW FORSAKEN BY THE REST OF THE TITANS HE SAW A PAIR COMING TOWARD HIM ONE HAD WINGS AND HE KNEW HIM TO BE HERMES THE MESSENGER OF THE GODS
7649-96667-0024 THE OTHER WAS A MAIDEN EPIMETHEUS MARVELED AT THE CROWN UPON HER HEAD AND AT HER LOVELY GARMENTS THERE WAS A GLINT OF GOLD ALL AROUND HER HE ROSE FROM WHERE HE SAT UPON THE BROKEN PILLAR
7649-96667-0025 AND AS SHE CAME NEARER THE CHARM THAT WAS ON HER LIPS AND IN HER EYES CAME TO THE EARTH BORN ONE AND HE SMILED WITH MORE AND MORE DELIGHT HERMES CAME AND STOOD BEFORE HIM HE ALSO SMILED
7649-96667-0026 BUT HIS SMILE HAD SOMETHING BALEFUL IN IT
7649-96667-0027 AND HE SAID O EPIMETHEUS FATHER ZEUS WOULD BE RECONCILED WITH THEE AND AS A SIGN OF HIS GOOD WILL HE SENDS THEE THIS LOVELY GODDESS TO BE THY COMPANION
7649-96667-0028 OH VERY FOOLISH WAS EPIMETHEUS THE EARTH BORN ONE AS HE LOOKED UPON THE GOLDEN MAID WHO WAS SENT BY ZEUS HE LOST MEMORY OF THE WARS THAT ZEUS HAD MADE UPON THE TITANS AND THE ELDER GODS
7649-96667-0029 HE LOST MEMORY OF HIS BROTHER CHAINED BY ZEUS TO THE ROCK HE LOST MEMORY OF THE WARNING THAT HIS BROTHER THE WISEST OF ALL BEINGS HAD SENT HIM HE TOOK THE HANDS OF PANDORA
7649-96667-0030 VERY FAR AWAY SEEMED THE VOICE OF HERMES SAYING THIS JAR TOO IS FROM OLYMPUS IT HAS IN IT PANDORA'S DOWER THE JAR STOOD FORGOTTEN FOR LONG AND GREEN PLANTS GREW OVER IT WHILE EPIMETHEUS
7649-96667-0031 WALKED IN THE GARDEN WITH THE GOLDEN MAID OR WATCHED HER WHILE SHE GAZED ON HERSELF IN THE STREAM OR SEARCHED IN THE UNTENDED PLACES FOR THE FRUITS THAT THE ELDER GODS WOULD EAT WHEN THEY FEASTED WITH THE TITANS IN THE OLD DAYS BEFORE ZEUS HAD COME TO HIS POWER
7649-96667-0032 AND LOST TO EPIMETHEUS WAS THE MEMORY OF HIS BROTHER NOW SUFFERING UPON THE ROCK BECAUSE OF THE GIFT HE HAD GIVEN TO MEN AND PANDORA KNOWING NOTHING EXCEPT THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUNSHINE AND THE LOVELY SHAPES AND COLORS OF THINGS
7649-96667-0033 AND THE SWEET TASTE OF THE FRUITS THAT EPIMETHEUS BROUGHT TO HER COULD HAVE STAYED FOREVER IN THAT GARDEN BUT EVERY DAY EPIMETHEUS WOULD THINK THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE WORLD
7649-96667-0034 SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT THIS MAIDEN WITH THE WONDERFUL RADIANCE OF GOLD AND WITH THE LOVELY GARMENTS AND THE MARVELOUS CROWN AND ONE DAY HE TOOK PANDORA BY THE HAND AND HE BROUGHT HER OUT OF THAT DEEP LYING VALLEY AND TOWARD THE HOMES OF MEN
7649-96667-0035 HE DID NOT FORGET THE JAR THAT HERMES HAD LEFT WITH HER ALL THINGS THAT BELONGED TO THE GOLDEN MAID WERE PRECIOUS AND EPIMETHEUS TOOK THE JAR ALONG THE RACE OF MEN AT THE TIME WERE SIMPLE AND CONTENT
7649-96667-0036 SINCE PROMETHEUS HAD GIVEN THEM FIRE THEY HAD GOOD FRUITS OF THEIR TOIL THEY HAD WELL SHAPED TOOLS TO DIG THE EARTH AND TO BUILD HOUSES THEIR HOMES WERE WARMED WITH FIRE AND FIRE BURNED UPON THE ALTARS THAT WERE UPON THEIR WAYS
7649-96667-0037 GREATLY THEY REVERENCED PROMETHEUS WHO HAD GIVEN THEM FIRE AND GREATLY THEY REVERENCED THE RACE OF THE TITANS SO WHEN EPIMETHEUS CAME AMONGST THEM
7649-96667-0038 TALL AS A MAN WALKING WITH STILTS THEY WELCOMED HIM AND BROUGHT HIM AND THE GOLDEN MAID TO THEIR HEARTHS AND EPIMETHEUS SHOWED PANDORA THE WONDERFUL ELEMENT THAT HIS BROTHER HAD GIVEN TO MEN AND SHE REJOICED TO SEE THE FIRE
7649-96667-0039 FOR THE LID THAT HAD BEEN TIGHT UPON IT NOW FITTED VERY LOOSELY BUT NO ONE GAVE HEED TO THE JAR AS IT STOOD IN THE OPEN SPACE WHERE EPIMETHEUS HAD LEFT IT AT FIRST
7649-96667-0040 THE MEN AND WOMEN LOOKED UPON THE BEAUTY OF PANDORA UPON HER LOVELY DRESSES AND HER GOLDEN CROWN AND HER GIRDLE OF FLOWERS WITH WONDER AND DELIGHT EPIMETHEUS WOULD HAVE EVERY ONE ADMIRE AND PRAISE HER
7649-96667-0041 OR BUILDING HOUSES AND THE WOMEN WOULD LEAVE OFF SPINNING OR WEAVING AND COME AT HIS CALL AND STAND ABOUT AND ADMIRE THE GOLDEN MAID BUT AS TIME WENT BY A CHANGE CAME UPON THE WOMEN ONE WOMAN WOULD WEEP
7649-96667-0042 AND ANOTHER WOULD LOOK ANGRY AND A THIRD WOULD GO BACK SULLENLY TO HER WORK WHEN PANDORA WAS ADMIRED OR PRAISED ONCE THE WOMEN WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND ONE WHO WAS THE WISEST AMONGST THEM SAID
7649-96667-0043 ONCE WE DID NOT THINK ABOUT OURSELVES AND WE WERE CONTENT BUT NOW WE THINK ABOUT OURSELVES AND WE SAY TO OURSELVES THAT WE ARE HARSH AND ILL FAVORED INDEED COMPARED TO THE GOLDEN MAID THAT THE TITAN IS SO ENCHANTED WITH
7649-96667-0044 AND WE HATE TO SEE OUR OWN MEN PRAISE AND ADMIRE HER AND OFTEN IN OUR HEARTS WE WOULD DESTROY HER IF WE COULD THAT IS TRUE THE WOMEN SAID AND THEN A YOUNG WOMAN CRIED OUT IN A MOST YEARNFUL VOICE
7649-96667-0045 O TELL US YOU WHO ARE WISE HOW CAN WE MAKE OURSELVES AS BEAUTIFUL AS PANDORA THEN SAID THAT WOMAN WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE WISE
7649-96667-0046 ARE ALL IN THAT JAR THAT EPIMETHEUS BROUGHT WITH HER WHEN THE WOMAN WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE WISE SAID THIS
7649-96667-0047 BUT THEN ONE AROSE AND ANOTHER AROSE AND THEY STOOD AND WHISPERED TOGETHER
7649-96667-0048 AND THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE OUT OF IT THE SALVES AND THE CHARMS AND THE WASHES THAT WOULD LEAVE THEM AS BEAUTIFUL AS PANDORA SO THE WOMEN WENT TO THAT PLACE ON THEIR WAY THEY STOPPED AT A POOL
7649-96667-0049 AND THEY BENT OVER TO SEE THEMSELVES MIRRORED IN IT AND THEY SAW THEMSELVES WITH DUSTY AND UNKEMPT HAIR WITH LARGE AND KNOTTED HANDS WITH TROUBLED EYES AND WITH ANXIOUS MOUTHS THEY FROWNED AS THEY LOOKED UPON THEIR IMAGES
7649-96667-0050 AND THEY SAID IN HARSH VOICES THAT IN A WHILE THEY WOULD HAVE WAYS OF MAKING THEMSELVES AS LOVELY AS THE GOLDEN MAID AND AS THEY WENT ON THEY SAW PANDORA SHE WAS PLAYING IN A FLOWERING FIELD WHILE EPIMETHEUS
7649-96667-0051 HIGH AS A MAN UPON STILTS WENT GATHERING THE BLOSSOMS OF THE BUSHES FOR HER THEY WENT ON AND THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE PLACE WHERE EPIMETHEUS HAD LEFT THE JAR THAT HELD PANDORA'S DOWER A GREAT STONE JAR IT WAS
7649-96667-0052 THERE WAS NO BIRD NOR FLOWER NOR BRANCH PAINTED UPON IT IT STOOD HIGH AS A WOMAN'S SHOULDER AND AS THE WOMEN LOOKED ON IT THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE WERE THINGS ENOUGH IN IT TO KEEP THEM BEAUTIFUL FOR ALL THE DAYS OF THEIR LIVES
7649-96667-0053 ONCE THE LID HAD BEEN FIXED TIGHTLY DOWN ON THE JAR BUT THE LID WAS SHIFTED A LITTLE NOW AS THE HANDS OF THE WOMEN GRASPED IT TO TAKE OFF THE LID THE JAR WAS CAST DOWN AND THE THINGS THAT WERE INSIDE SPILLED THEMSELVES FORTH
7649-96667-0054 THEY WERE BLACK AND GRAY AND RED THEY WERE CRAWLING AND FLYING THINGS AND AS THE WOMEN LOOKED THE THINGS SPREAD THEMSELVES ABROAD OR FASTENED THEMSELVES UPON THEM THE JAR LIKE PANDORA HERSELF
7649-96667-0055 HAD BEEN MADE AND FILLED OUT OF THE ILL WILL OF ZEUS AND IT HAD BEEN FILLED NOT WITH SALVES AND CHARMS AND WASHES AS THE WOMEN HAD THOUGHT BUT WITH CARES AND TROUBLES
7649-96667-0056 BEFORE THE WOMEN CAME TO IT ONE TROUBLE HAD ALREADY COME FORTH FROM THE JAR SELF THOUGHT THAT WAS UPON THE TOP OF THE HEAP IT WAS SELF THOUGHT THAT HAD AFFLICTED THE WOMEN MAKING THEM TROUBLED ABOUT THEIR OWN LOOKS
7649-96667-0057 AND ENVIOUS OF THE GRACES OF THE GOLDEN MAID AND NOW THE OTHERS SPREAD THEMSELVES OUT SICKNESS AND WAR AND STRIFE BETWEEN FRIENDS THEY SPREAD THEMSELVES ABROAD AND ENTERED THE HOUSES WHILE EPIMETHEUS THE MINDLESS TITAN
7649-96667-0058 GATHERED FLOWERS FOR PANDORA THE GOLDEN MAID LEST SHE SHOULD WEARY OF HER PLAY HE CALLED TO HER HE WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE HOUSES OF MEN AS THEY DREW NEAR TO THE HOUSES THEY SAW A WOMAN SEATED ON THE GROUND WEEPING
7649-96667-0059 HER HUSBAND HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HARD TO HER AND HAD SHUT THE DOOR ON HER FACE THEY CAME UPON A CHILD CRYING BECAUSE OF A PAIN THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND AND THEN THEY FOUND TWO MEN STRUGGLING THEIR STRIFE BEING ON ACCOUNT OF A POSSESSION
7649-96667-0060 IN EVERY HOUSE THEY WENT TO EPIMETHEUS WOULD SAY I AM THE BROTHER OF PROMETHEUS WHO GAVE YOU THE GIFT OF FIRE BUT INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM A WELCOME THE MEN WOULD SAY WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOUR RELATION TO PROMETHEUS
7649-96667-0061 WE SEE YOU AS A FOOLISH MAN UPON STILTS EPIMETHEUS WAS TROUBLED BY THE HARD LOOKS AND THE COLD WORDS OF THE MEN WHO ONCE HAD REVERENCED HIM HE TURNED FROM THE HOUSES AND WENT AWAY IN A QUIET PLACE HE SAT DOWN
7649-96667-0062 THAT HE HEARD THE VOICE OF HIS WISE AND SUFFERING BROTHER SAYING DO NOT ACCEPT ANY GIFT THAT ZEUS MAY SEND YOU HE ROSE UP AND HE HURRIED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE LEAVING PANDORA PLAYING BY HERSELF
7649-96667-0063 THERE CAME INTO HIS SCATTERED MIND REGRET AND FEAR AS HE WENT ON HE STUMBLED HE FELL FROM THE EDGE OF A CLIFF AND THE SEA WASHED AWAY THE BODY OF THE MINDLESS BROTHER OF PROMETHEUS
7649-96667-0064 NOT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN SPILLED OUT OF THE JAR THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT WITH PANDORA INTO THE WORLD OF MEN A BEAUTIFUL LIVING THING WAS IN THAT JAR ALSO THIS WAS HOPE
7649-96667-0065 AND THIS BEAUTIFUL LIVING THING HAD GOT CAUGHT UNDER THE RIM OF THE JAR AND HAD NOT COME FORTH WITH THE OTHERS ONE DAY A WEEPING WOMAN FOUND HOPE UNDER THE RIM OF PANDORA'S JAR AND BROUGHT THIS LIVING THING INTO THE HOUSE OF MEN
7649-96667-0066 AND NOW BECAUSE OF HOPE THEY COULD SEE AN END TO THEIR TROUBLES AND THE MEN AND WOMEN ROUSED THEMSELVES IN THE MIDST OF THEIR AFFLICTIONS AND THEY LOOKED TOWARD GLADNESS HOPE
7649-96667-0067 THAT HAD BEEN CAUGHT UNDER THE RIM OF THE JAR STAYED BEHIND THE THRESHOLDS OF THEIR HOUSES AS FOR PANDORA THE GOLDEN MAID SHE PLAYED ON KNOWING ONLY THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUNSHINE AND THE LOVELY SHAPES OF THINGS
7649-96667-0068 BEAUTIFUL WOULD SHE HAVE SEEMED TO ANY BEING WHO SAW HER BUT NOW SHE HAD STRAYED AWAY FROM THE HOUSES OF MEN AND EPIMETHEUS WAS NOT THERE TO LOOK UPON HER THEN HEPHAESTUS THE LAME ARTISAN OF THE GODS
7649-96667-0069 LEFT DOWN HIS TOOLS AND WENT TO SEEK HER HE FOUND PANDORA AND HE TOOK HER BACK TO OLYMPUS AND IN HIS BRAZEN HOUSE SHE STAYS THOUGH SOMETIMES AT THE WILL OF ZEUS SHE GOES DOWN INTO THE WORLD OF MEN
7649-96667-0070 WHEN POLYDEUCES HAD ENDED THE STORY THAT CASTOR HAD BEGUN HERACLES CRIED OUT FOR THE ARGONAUTS TOO THERE HAS BEEN A GOLDEN MAID NAY NOT ONE
7649-96667-0071 BUT A GOLDEN MAID FOR EACH OUT OF THE JAR THAT HAS BEEN WITH HER YE HAVE TAKEN FORGETFULNESS OF YOUR HONOR AS FOR ME I GO BACK TO THE ARGO
7649-96667-0072 LEST ONE OF THESE GOLDEN MAIDS SHOULD HOLD ME BACK FROM THE LABORS THAT MAKE GREAT A MAN SO HERACLES SAID
7649-96667-0073 AND STOOD BEFORE JASON THERE WAS A STORM IN ALL HER BODY HER MOUTH WAS SHAKEN AND A WHOLE LIFE'S TROUBLE WAS IN HER GREAT EYES BEFORE SHE SPOKE JASON CRIED OUT
7649-96667-0074 WHAT HERACLES SAID IS TRUE O ARGONAUTS ON THE QUEST OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE OUR LIVES AND OUR HONORS DEPEND TO COLCHIS
7649-96667-0075 HE STOOD UPRIGHT IN THE HALL AND HIS COMRADES GATHERED AROUND HIM THE LEMNIAN MAIDENS WOULD HAVE HELD OUT THEIR ARMS AND WOULD HAVE MADE THEIR PARTINGS LONG DELAYED BUT THAT A STRANGE CRY CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE NIGHT
7649-96667-0076 WELL DID THE ARGONAUTS KNOW THAT CRY IT WAS THE CRY OF THE SHIP OF ARGO HERSELF THEY KNEW THAT THEY MUST GO TO HER NOW OR STAY FROM THE VOYAGE FOR EVER
7649-96667-0077 AND THE MAIDENS KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE CRY OF THE SHIP THAT MIGHT NOT BE GAINSAID AND THEY PUT THEIR HANDS BEFORE THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID NO OTHER WORD
7649-96667-0078 I TOO AM A RULER JASON AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE GREAT COMMANDS THAT WE HAVE TO OBEY GO THEN TO THE ARGO AH NEITHER I NOR THE WOMEN OF LEMNOS WILL STAY YOUR GOING NOW
7649-96667-0079 BUT TO MORROW SPEAK TO US FROM THE DECK OF THE SHIP AND BID US FAREWELL DO NOT GO FROM US IN THE NIGHT JASON
7649-96667-0080 SHE SAT ON THE THRONE OF KING THOAS AND SHE HAD POLYXO HER NURSE TELL HER OF THE WAYS OF JASON'S VOYAGE AS HE HAD TOLD OF THEM AND OF ALL THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PASS THROUGH WHEN THE OTHER LEMNIAN WOMEN SLEPT
7649-96667-0081 SHE PUT HER HEAD UPON HER NURSE'S KNEES AND WEPT
7649-96667-0082 FOR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE OTHERS HEAR HER WEEPING BY THE COMING OF THE MORNING'S LIGHT THE ARGONAUTS HAD MADE ALL READY FOR THEIR SAILING THEY WERE STANDING ON THE DECK WHEN THE LIGHT CAME AND THEY SAW THE LEMNIAN WOMEN COME TO THE SHORE
7649-96667-0083 EACH LOOKED AT HER FRIEND ABOARD THE ARGO AND SPOKE AND WENT AWAY AND LAST
7649-96667-0084 AND SHE IN HER STRANGE WAY OF SPEAKING SAID WHAT YOU TOLD US I HAVE REMEMBERED HOW YOU WILL COME TO THE DANGEROUS PASSAGE THAT LEADS INTO THE SEA OF PONTUS
7649-96667-0085 AND HOW BY THE FLIGHT OF A PIGEON YOU WILL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU MAY GO THAT WAY O JASON
7649-96667-0086 SHE SHOWED A PIGEON HELD IN HER HANDS SHE LOOSED IT AND THE PIGEON ALIGHTED ON THE SHIP AND STAYED THERE ON PINK FEET A WHITE FEATHERED PIGEON
