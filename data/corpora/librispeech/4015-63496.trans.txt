4015-63496-0000 THE LEAST THINGS BECOME GREAT EVENTS IN THE COUNTRY
4015-63496-0001 WHO WERE ON THE MORNING BEFORE US WALKING IN THE SQUARE BEFORE THE CHURCH WERE VERY ANXIOUSLY BESTIRRING THEMSELVES TO LEARN WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD ARRIVE WHO HAD RECENTLY BECOME THE PURCHASER OF THE MOST ELIGIBLE PREMISES
4015-63496-0002 FOR A BUTCHER IN THAT TOWN AND WHICH WERE EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THE CHURCH ONE OF THOSE IDLERS MORE INQUISITIVE THAN HIS COMPANIONS WENT AND ASKED THE BUTCHER BOY
4015-63496-0003 WHO WITH A MERRY FACE AND ACTIVE HANDS WAS VERY BUSY IN COMPLETING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SHOP
4015-63496-0004 FOR HE HAD BOUGHT THE PROPERTY THROUGH AN AGENT AT THIS MOMENT TWO PERSONS WHO HAD COME FROM PARIS IN A CABRIOLET ALIGHTED AT THE DOOR OF THE SHOP THE ONE WAS MURPHY QUITE CURED OF HIS WOUND
4015-63496-0005 AND THE OTHER THE CHOURINEUR AT THE RISK OF REPEATING A VULGAR SAYING WE WILL ASSERT THAT THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY DRESS IS SO POWERFUL
4015-63496-0006 WAS HARDLY TO BE RECOGNISED IN HIS PRESENT ATTIRE HIS COUNTENANCE HAD UNDERGONE THE SAME CHANGE HE HAD PUT OFF WITH HIS RAGS HIS SAVAGE COARSE AND VULGAR AIR
4015-63496-0007 AND TO SEE HIM WALK WITH BOTH HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF HIS LONG AND WARM COAT OF DARK BROADCLOTH HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THE MOST INOFFENSIVE CITIZENS IN THE WORLD FAITH MY FINE FELLOW

4015-63496-0018 DID NOT TELL ME TO DO SO AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HE HAD NO FURTHER OCCASION FOR ME BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST DESIRE TO EXPRESS HIS GRATITUDE TO YOU

4015-63496-0031 AND THAT IT CANNOT LAST I WOULD RATHER SLEEP ALL MY LIFE ON THE WRETCHED STRAW BED IN MY COCK LOFT THAN SLEEP FIVE OR SIX NIGHTS ONLY IN A GOOD BED THAT'S MY VIEW OF THE THING AND YOU ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIAR IN YOUR VIEW
4015-63496-0032 BUT THE BEST THING IS TO SLEEP ALWAYS IN A GOOD BED AND NO MISTAKE IT IS BETTER TO HAVE A BELLYFUL OF VICTUALS EVERY DAY THAN TO STARVE WITH HUNGER AH HERE IS A BUTCHERY HERE SAID THE CHOURINEUR
4015-63496-0033 AS HE LISTENED TO THE BLOWS OF THE CHOPPER WHICH THE BOY WAS USING AND OBSERVED THE QUARTERS OF BEEF THROUGH THE CURTAINS YES MY LAD IT BELONGS TO A FRIEND OF MINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT WHILST THE HORSE JUST RECOVERS HIS WIND
4015-63496-0034 IF IT WAS ONLY WHEN I HAD MONTFAUCON FOR A SLAUGHTER HOUSE AND BROKEN DOWN HORSES FOR CATTLE IT IS DROLL BUT IF I HAD THE MEANS A BUTCHER'S IS THE TRADE IN WHICH I SHOULD SET UP FOR I LIKE IT TO GO ON A GOOD NAG TO BUY CATTLE AT FAIRS
4015-63496-0035 TO RETURN HOME TO ONE'S OWN FIRESIDE TO WARM YOURSELF IF COLD OR DRY YOURSELF IF WET TO FIND YOUR HOUSEKEEPER OR A GOOD JOLLY PLUMP WIFE CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT WITH A PARCEL OF CHILDREN TO FEEL IN YOUR POCKETS
4015-63496-0036 AND THEN IN THE MORNING IN THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE TO SEIZE AN OX BY THE HORNS PARTICULARLY WHEN HE'S FIERCE NOM DE NOM HE MUST BE FIERCE THEN TO PUT ON THE RING TO CLEAVE HIM DOWN CUT HIM UP
4015-63496-0037 DRESS HIM TONNERRE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY AMBITION AS IT WAS THE GOUALEUSE'S TO SUCK BARLEY SUGAR WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE UN
4015-63496-0038 NOT SEEING HER ANY MORE AT THE OGRESS'S
4015-63496-0039 HAD TAKEN HER AWAY FROM THERE
4015-63496-0040 POOR CHILD SHE NEVER LIKED TO DO WRONG SHE WAS SO YOUNG AND THEN THE HABIT
4015-63496-0041 BUT WILL YOU COME INTO THE SHOP UNTIL OUR HORSE HAS RESTED AWHILE THE CHOURINEUR AND MURPHY ENTERED THE SHOP AND THEN WENT TO SEE THE YARD WHERE THREE SPLENDID OXEN
4015-63496-0042 THE CHAISE HOUSE THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE THE LOFTS AND THE OUT BUILDINGS OF THE HOUSE WHICH WERE ALL IN EXCELLENT ORDER AND KEPT WITH A CLEANLINESS AND CARE WHICH BESPOKE REGULARITY AND EASY CIRCUMSTANCES

4015-63496-0044 AND HE IS BESIDES ONLY THIRTY EIGHT STRONG AS A BULL WITH AN IRON CONSTITUTION AND VERY FOND OF HIS BUSINESS THE INDUSTRIOUS AND CIVIL JOURNEYMAN THAT YOU SAW IN THE SHOP SUPPLIES HIS PLACE
4015-63496-0045 WITH MUCH CAPABILITY WHEN HE GOES TO THE FAIRS TO PURCHASE CATTLE I SAY AGAIN IS HE NOT A LUCKY FELLOW
4015-63496-0046 BUT YOU SEE THERE ARE LUCKY AND UNLUCKY PEOPLE AND WHEN I THINK THAT I AM GOING TO GAIN FOUR FRANCS A DAY AND KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE WHO ONLY EARN THE HALF OR EVEN LESS WILL YOU COME UP AND SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE
4015-63496-0047 ONE MOMENT SAID THE CHOURINEUR WITH A DOWNCAST AND EMBARRASSED AIR TAKING MURPHY BY THE ARM LISTEN WHILST I SAY A WORD TO YOU
4015-63496-0048 BUT WHICH I OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL FROM THE MASTER WHO EMPLOYS ME BECAUSE IF HE IS OFFENDED BY IT WHY THEN YOU SEE WHY AFTERWARDS WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY
4015-63496-0049 I MEAN TO SAY WELL WHAT THAT I AM A CONVICT WHO HAS SERVED HIS TIME
4015-63496-0050 INDEED REPLIED MURPHY BUT I NEVER DID WRONG TO ANY ONE EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR AND I WOULD SOONER DIE OF HUNGER THAN ROB BUT I HAVE DONE WORSE THAN ROB HE ADDED BENDING HIS HEAD DOWN
