6499-57667-0000 IT HAS BEEN GRAVELY ASSERTED THAT THE CONFESSION OF SIN AND THE DOCTRINE OF ABSOLUTION TEND TO THE SPREAD OF CRIME AND IMMORALITY
6499-57667-0001 STATISTICS ARE PRODUCED TO SHOW THAT MURDER AND ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS ARE LARGELY IN EXCESS IN COUNTRIES UNDER CATHOLIC INFLUENCE AND THAT THIS PREVALENCE OF WICKEDNESS IS THE RESULT OF CONFESSION AND EASY ABSOLUTION
6499-57667-0002 AS ALL OUR CATECHISMS TEACH AND AS EVERY CATHOLIC KNOWS THERE IS NO PARDON OF SIN WITHOUT SORROW OF HEART AND PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT
6499-57667-0003 IT IS A GREAT MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MOST IGNORANT CATHOLIC BELIEVES HE CAN PROCURE THE PARDON OF HIS SINS BY SIMPLY CONFESSING THEM WITHOUT BEING TRULY SORRY FOR THEM
6499-57667-0004 THE ESTIMATE WHICH SO MANY PROTESTANTS SET ON THE VIRTUE OF EVEN THE LOWER CLASSES OF ROMAN CATHOLICS IS CLEARLY ENOUGH EVINCED IN THE PREFERENCE WHICH THEY CONSTANTLY MANIFEST IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT OF CATHOLICS PRACTICAL CATHOLICS
6499-57667-0005 NIGHTS AMONG ROMANISTS AND SIMILAR ABSOLUTELY UNRELIABLE COMPILATIONS THE FALSE STATEMENTS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN REFUTED
6499-57667-0006 BUT HOW DO THESE STATEMENTS COMPARE WITH THE OFFICIAL RECORDS WHICH I SUBMIT TO THE UNPREJUDICED READER RECENT RETURNS FROM THE HAND BOOK FOR FRANCE AND THOM'S OFFICIAL DIRECTORY FOR ENGLAND AND IRELAND EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE ARE AS FOLLOWS
6499-57667-0007 THESE FIGURES WHICH ARE FROM AUTHENTICATED SOURCES DO NOT BEAR OUT OUR ACCUSERS IN THEIR ASSERTION THAT MURDERS ARE MORE PREVALENT IN CATHOLIC THAN IN PROTESTANT COUNTRIES THE STATISTICS OF THIS CRIME ARE LIMITED
6499-57667-0008 OR THEY ARE NOT IN VERY GENERAL CIRCULATION
6499-57667-0009 HERE AGAIN WE SHALL MEET STATISTICS WITH COUNTER STATISTICS TO REFUTE UNJUST DECLARATIONS WE DO NOT WISH TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS ADVOCATING THE IMMACULATENESS OF CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES
6499-57667-0010 THE JOURNAL OF THE STATISTICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON OF THE YEARS EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIXTY TWO SIXTY FIVE SIXTY SEVEN GIVES THE NUMBER OF ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN ENGLAND AND WALES AS
6499-57667-0011 WHILST IN THE CATHOLIC KINGDOM OF SARDINIA THE NUMBER IS SLIGHTLY OVER TWO IN THE HUNDRED AND IN IRELAND THREE IN EVERY HUNDRED IF THE TEST OF ILLEGITIMACY IS A CORRECT INDEX OF THE MORALITY OF A COUNTRY
6499-57667-0012 I WILL HERE INSERT AS CORRECT A TABLE AS CAN BE MADE FROM THE LATEST REPORTS
6499-57667-0013 FRANCE SEVEN POINT TWO PRUSSIA
6499-57667-0014 AMONG THE PROTESTANTS IT RUNS UP TO TEN PER CENT AND THE SAME REMARK IS APPLICABLE TO IRELAND THE SCOTMAN WHOSE STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE REPORT OF THE BRITISH REGISTRAR GENERAL PUBLISHES THE FOLLOWING STATISTICS
6499-57667-0015 THE PROPORTION OF ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BIRTHS IS IN IRELAND THREE POINT EIGHT PER CENT IN ENGLAND THE PROPORTION IS SIX POINT FOUR
6499-57667-0016 THE DIVISION SHOWING THIS LOWEST FIGURE IS THE WESTERN BEING SUBSTANTIALLY THE PROVINCE OF CONNAUGHT WHERE ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTIETHS OF THE POPULATION ARE CELTIC AND ROMAN CATHOLIC
6499-57667-0017 THE DIVISION SHOWING THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF ILLEGITIMACY IS THE NORTH EASTERN WHICH COMPRISES OR ALMOST CONSISTS OF THE PROVINCE OF ULSTER WHERE THE POPULATION IS ALMOST EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN PROTESTANTS AND ROMAN CATHOLICS
6499-57667-0018 AND WHERE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PROTESTANTS ARE OF SCOTCH BLOOD AND OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH THE SUM OF THE WHOLE MATTER IS THAT SEMI PRESBYTERIAN AND SEMI SCOTCH ULSTER
6499-57667-0019 IS FULLY THREE TIMES MORE IMMORAL THAN WHOLLY POPISH AND WHOLLY IRISH CONNAUGHT WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH WONDERFUL ACCURACY TO THE MORE GENERAL FACT THAT SCOTLAND AS A WHOLE IS THREE TIMES MORE IMMORAL THAN IRELAND AS A WHOLE
6499-57667-0020 IT IS WORTHY TOO OF NOTICE THAT IN THE TABULAR STATEMENT ABOVE PRESENTED THE PERCENTAGE OF ILLEGITIMACY IN HOLLAND AND SWITZERLAND WHERE THERE ARE LARGE CATHOLIC MINORITIES IS LOWER THAN IN ANY OTHER PROTESTANT COUNTRY
6499-57667-0021 OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN CHILDREN BORN IN STOCKHOLM ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN WERE LEGITIMATE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN ILLEGITIMATE MAKING ONLY A BALANCE OF FOUR HUNDRED FORTY CHASTE MOTHERS
6499-57667-0022 OUT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN AND THE PROPORTION OF ILLEGITIMATE TO LEGITIMATE CHILDREN NOT AS ONE TO TWO AND THREE TENTHS BUT AS ONE TO ONE AND A HALF
6499-57667-0023 BUT WE ARE NOT DISPOSED TO PARADE THESE MONSTROUS VICES NO MATTER BY WHOM COMMITTED WE ALLUDE TO THEM WITH FEELINGS OF SHAME NOT OF PLEASURE
6499-57667-0024 WHICH THEIR RELIGION AFFORDS OUGHT TO BE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY ARE YET WE WILL ADD QUOTING THE WORDS OF THE CATHOLIC WORLD
