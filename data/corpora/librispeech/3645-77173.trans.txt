3645-77173-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE IMPOSTOR THE SUN NEWLY SUNK BEHIND THE YELDO HILLS HAD STAINED THE SKY WITH ROSE AND AMBER AND IT WAS VERY PEACEFUL IN THE DARKENING GROUNDS OF THE PALACE OF CORBO
3645-77173-0001 THE WOODS WERE ALIVE WITH THE EVENING SONGS OF THE BIRDS AND A LIGHT WIND THAT BLEW IN FROM THE SEA BROUGHT WITH IT THE CHIMES FROM THE CATHEDRAL BELFRY THE SHRUBBERIES LOOMED BIG IN THE VIOLET TWILIGHT AND AFAR OUT THE SEA LAY PLACID
3645-77173-0002 STEEL BLUE AND MYSTERIOUS EDWARD POVEY SURVEYING THE SCENE FROM THE COMFORT OF A BATH CHAIR WAS PUTTING TO HIMSELF A FEW PERTINENT AND VERY NECESSARY QUESTIONS SOME LINES WHICH HE HAD HEARD YEARS BACK CAME INTO HIS MIND
3645-77173-0003 HE COULDN'T REMEMBER THEM EXACTLY BUT THEY HAD TO DO WITH WHAT THE DEVIL WOULD DO WHEN HE WAS SICK AMONGST OTHER THOUGHTS WHICH CROWDED INTO THE BRAIN OF MISTER POVEY WERE THE WARM FEELINGS HE HAD EXPERIENCED TOWARDS CHARLOTTE WHEN AS HE THOUGHT HE LAY DYING IN ENRICO'S DEATH CHAMBER
3645-77173-0004 AND HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT THEY WERE VERY RIGHT THOUGHTS TO HAVE HE REMEMBERED ALSO THE EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW MONTHS GALVA'S UNREMITTING CARE AND TENDERNESS TO HIM DURING THE PERIOD OF HIS CONVALESCENCE
3645-77173-0005 THE THOUGHT THAT THE TIME HAD NOW COME WHEN HIS PART IN HER AFFAIRS WAS DONE WAS A VERY BITTER ONE BUT AS DAY FOLLOWED DAY THE FEELING THAT HE WAS AN IMPOSTOR GREW STRONGER HE HAD LONG THOUGHT THAT HE MUST GET AWAY FROM IT ALL
3645-77173-0006 THE THOUGHT OF THE DISGUST THAT MIGHT SHOW IN HER FACE UNNERVED HIM HE FELT VERY THANKFUL THAT HIS FEARS OF DEATH HAD BEEN PREMATURE AND THAT HE HAD BEEN SPARED TO WITNESS THE RECEPTION BY THE CORBIANS OF THEIR NEW QUEEN BUT AT THE SAME TIME
3645-77173-0007 THE GRIM VISITOR WOULD AT LEAST HAVE PUT HIM OUT OF HIS PREDICAMENT HIS RECOVERY HAD NOT BEEN RAPID ENOUGH TO ALLOW OF HIS ATTENDING THE FESTIVITIES OF THE CORONATION WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE WITH MUCH POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE A FEW WEEKS AFTER ENRICO HAD BEEN LAID IN THE CATHEDRAL
3645-77173-0008 THE KINDLY DOCTOR HOWEVER HAD PERMITTED THE INVALID'S COUCH TO BE WHEELED OUT ON TO ONE OF THE BALCONIES OF HIS ROOM FROM THERE HE HAD SEEN THE PROCESSION LEAVE THE PALACE HAD NOTED THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE HOLIDAY CROWD AND BEST OF ALL
3645-77173-0009 HAD SEEN GALVA TURN IN HER CARRIAGE AND WAVE HER BOUQUET OF ORCHIDS AT HIS BALCONY THEN THE CAVALCADE WINDING LIKE A GAILY COLOURED STREAM OF RIBBON HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN THE TWISTINGS AND TURNINGS OF THE OLD TOWN AND POVEY
3645-77173-0010 LYING THERE IN THE GENIAL AFTERNOON SUNSHINE HAD BEEN LEFT TO IMAGINE THE REST BY THE AID OF HIS FIELD GLASSES HE HAD SEEN THE BUNTING AND BANNERS FLUTTERING BRAVELY ON THE BUILDINGS IN THE TOWN WHICH LAY SPREAD OUT BENEATH HIM SHINING LIKE A JEWELLER'S TRAY OF GEMS IN THE SUN RAYS
3645-77173-0011 HE HAD SEEN THE YACHTS IN THE BAY GAY WITH LITTLE FLAGS HE HAD HEARD TOO THE BELLS PEALING JOYOUSLY FROM THE TALL BELFRY OF THE CATHEDRAL THE FIRING OF THE GUNS ON THE FORT AND THE DISTANT MURMUR OF THE PEOPLE CHEERING THEIR QUEEN
3645-77173-0012 HE HAD SAID A LITTLE PRAYER FOR EVERYBODY AND HAD FALLEN ASLEEP THERE ON THE FLOWER DECKED BALCONY WHEN HE AWOKE HE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ROOM AND THE CANDLES WERE BEING LIT
3645-77173-0013 THE QUEEN OF SAN PIETRO STOOD THERE BEFORE HIM FLUSHED WITH HER HAPPINESS AND RESPLENDENT IN HER FINERY OF STATE HER LITTLE HEAD WAS THROWN SLIGHTLY BACK AND SHE APPEARED TALLER THAN SHE REALLY WAS IN THE SWEEPING MANTLE OF CRIMSON AND ERMINE
3645-77173-0014 NOTHING BUT SUN AND CHEERS AND FLOWERS AND JOY SHE TURNED TO HER HUSBAND WHO WAS STANDING A LITTLE BEHIND HER FOR THE CEREMONIES IN THE CATHEDRAL HAD BEEN TWOFOLD THAT DAY AND THE ARCHBISHOP WHO HAD PLACED THE CROWN ON THE LITTLE HEAD HAD IN THE LITTLE PRIVATE CHAPEL
3645-77173-0015 PLACED A CIRCLET OF GOLD ALSO ON THE QUEEN'S FINGER I DIDN'T SEE A SINGLE HOUSE ARMAND SHE RAN ON THAT WAS NOT FLYING A FLAG AND TO THINK THAT WE OWE ALL THIS TO GUARDY HERE IF HE HAD DIED AND WE REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DIDN'T WE
3645-77173-0016 AS HE SAT IN HIS BATH CHAIR HE REMEMBERED ALL THESE THINGS AND SIGHED REGRETFULLY AS HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY LEFT FOR HIM IN HONOUR TO TAKE IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE STAGE TO TAKE OFF THE MOTLEY FOR HE HAD NO PART IN THE NEXT ACT OF THE DRAMA
3645-77173-0017 THE ATTENDANT WHO IN THE GORGEOUS ESTRATO LIVERY WAS SLOWLY PROPELLING THE CHAIR PULLED UP RATHER SUDDENLY AS TURNING INTO ONE OF THE ALLEY WAYS WHICH LED BACK TO THE PALACE HE CAME IN SIGHT OF THE FIGURE OF A WOMAN
3645-77173-0018 ANNA PALUDA TURNED AT THE SOUND OF THE WHEELS ON THE GRAVEL
3645-77173-0019 SPEAKING OF COMMONPLACES ON SUBJECTS RANGING FROM THE POLITICS SUCH AS THEY WERE OF SAN PIETRO TO THE EVENING LIGHT SHINING IN THE WESTERN WINDOWS OF THE PALACE THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT CAME TO THE MAN IN THE CHAIR AND HE TURNED TO THE LADY BY HIS SIDE

3645-77173-0025 AGAIN EDWARD WOULD HAVE SEEN A LOOK COME INTO ANNA'S EYES DISAPPOINTMENT THIS TIME UNMISTAKABLE DISAPPOINTMENT AT HIS LAST WORDS BUT THE WOMAN SAID NOTHING AND BEFORE EDWARD SPOKE AGAIN THE CHAIR HAD REACHED THE DOORWAY OF THE PALACE AND FOOTMEN WERE ASSISTING HIM TO ALIGHT
3645-77173-0026 THEN SHE TURNED AND MADE HER WAY SWIFTLY TO HER OWN ROOM ENTERING SHE LOCKED THE DOOR AND CROSSED TO THE LARGE WARDROBE WHICH TOOK UP ONE SIDE OF THE APARTMENT WALL FROM BENEATH SOME CLOTHES IN A DRAWER SHE LIFTED HER LEATHER JEWEL CASE
