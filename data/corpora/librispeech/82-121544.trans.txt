82-121544-0093 TOWARDS US THEREFORE LOOK IN FRONT OF THEE MY MASTER SAID IF THOU DISCERNEST HIM AS WHEN THERE BREATHES A HEAVY FOG OR WHEN OUR HEMISPHERE IS DARKENING INTO NIGHT
82-121544-0094 APPEARS FAR OFF A MILL THE WIND IS TURNING METHOUGHT THAT SUCH A BUILDING THEN I SAW AND FOR THE WIND I DREW MYSELF BEHIND MY GUIDE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OTHER SHELTER
82-121544-0095 NOW WAS I AND WITH FEAR IN VERSE I PUT IT THERE WHERE THE SHADES WERE WHOLLY COVERED UP
82-121544-0096 OTHERS STAND ERECT THIS WITH THE HEAD AND THAT ONE WITH THE SOLES ANOTHER BOW LIKE FACE TO FEET INVERTS WHEN IN ADVANCE SO FAR WE HAD PROCEEDED
82-121544-0097 THE CREATURE WHO ONCE HAD THE BEAUTEOUS SEMBLANCE
82-121544-0098 AND MADE ME STOP SAYING BEHOLD DIS AND BEHOLD THE PLACE WHERE THOU WITH FORTITUDE MUST ARM THYSELF HOW FROZEN I BECAME AND POWERLESS THEN ASK IT NOT READER
82-121544-0099 BEING OF BOTH DEPRIVED THE EMPEROR OF THE KINGDOM DOLOROUS FROM HIS MID BREAST FORTH ISSUED FROM THE ICE AND BETTER WITH A GIANT I COMPARE THAN DO THE GIANTS WITH THOSE ARMS OF HIS
82-121544-0100 CONSIDER NOW HOW GREAT MUST BE THAT WHOLE
82-121544-0101 AND LIFTED UP HIS BROW AGAINST HIS MAKER
82-121544-0102 O WHAT A MARVEL IT APPEARED TO ME WHEN I BEHELD THREE FACES ON HIS HEAD THE ONE IN FRONT AND THAT VERMILION WAS TWO WERE THE OTHERS THAT WERE JOINED WITH THIS
82-121544-0103 ABOVE THE MIDDLE PART OF EITHER SHOULDER AND THEY WERE JOINED TOGETHER AT THE CREST AND THE RIGHT HAND ONE SEEMED TWIXT WHITE AND YELLOW THE LEFT WAS SUCH TO LOOK UPON AS THOSE WHO COME FROM WHERE THE NILE FALLS VALLEY WARD
82-121544-0104 UNDERNEATH EACH CAME FORTH TWO MIGHTY WINGS
82-121544-0105 SAILS OF THE SEA I NEVER SAW SO LARGE NO FEATHERS HAD THEY BUT AS OF A BAT THEIR FASHION WAS AND HE WAS WAVING THEM
82-121544-0106 THEREBY
82-121544-0107 AT EVERY MOUTH HE WITH HIS TEETH WAS CRUNCHING A SINNER IN THE MANNER OF A BRAKE SO THAT HE THREE OF THEM TORMENTED THUS
82-121544-0108 WHICH HAS THE GREATEST PAIN THE MASTER SAID IS JUDAS ISCARIOT WITH HEAD INSIDE HE PLIES HIS LEGS WITHOUT OF THE TWO OTHERS WHO HEAD DOWNWARD ARE
82-121544-0109 THE ONE WHO HANGS FROM THE BLACK JOWL IS BRUTUS SEE HOW HE WRITHES HIMSELF AND SPEAKS NO WORD AND THE OTHER WHO SO STALWART SEEMS IS CASSIUS BUT NIGHT IS REASCENDING
82-121544-0110 AND TIS TIME THAT WE DEPART FOR WE HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE AS SEEMED HIM GOOD I CLASPED HIM ROUND THE NECK
82-121544-0111 AND WHEN THE WINGS WERE OPENED WIDE APART HE LAID FAST HOLD UPON THE SHAGGY SIDES FROM FELL TO FELL DESCENDED DOWNWARD THEN BETWEEN THE THICK HAIR AND THE FROZEN CRUST
82-121544-0112 WHEN WE WERE COME TO WHERE THE THIGH REVOLVES EXACTLY ON THE THICKNESS OF THE HAUNCH THE GUIDE WITH LABOUR AND WITH HARD DRAWN BREATH
82-121544-0113 PANTING AS ONE FATIGUED MUST WE PERFORCE DEPART FROM SO MUCH EVIL THEN THROUGH THE OPENING OF A ROCK HE ISSUED AND DOWN UPON THE MARGIN SEATED ME
82-121544-0114 THEN TOW'RDS ME HE OUTSTRETCHED HIS WARY STEP I LIFTED UP MINE EYES AND THOUGHT TO SEE LUCIFER IN THE SAME WAY I HAD LEFT HIM AND I BEHELD HIM UPWARD HOLD HIS LEGS
82-121544-0115 AND IF I THEN BECAME DISQUIETED LET STOLID PEOPLE THINK WHO DO NOT SEE WHAT THE POINT IS BEYOND WHICH I HAD PASSED RISE UP THE MASTER SAID UPON THY FEET
82-121544-0116 THE WAY IS LONG AND DIFFICULT THE ROAD AND NOW THE SUN TO MIDDLE TIERCE RETURNS IT WAS NOT ANY PALACE CORRIDOR THERE WHERE WE WERE BUT DUNGEON NATURAL
82-121544-0117 WITH FLOOR UNEVEN AND UNEASE OF LIGHT ERE FROM THE ABYSS I TEAR MYSELF AWAY MY MASTER SAID I WHEN I HAD ARISEN TO DRAW ME FROM AN ERROR SPEAK A LITTLE
82-121544-0118 THOU STILL IMAGINEST THOU ART BEYOND THE CENTRE WHERE I GRASPED THE HAIR OF THE FELL WORM WHO MINES THE WORLD THAT SIDE THOU WAST SO LONG AS I DESCENDED
82-121544-0119 AND NOW BENEATH THE HEMISPHERE ART COME
82-121544-0120 AND NEATH WHOSE COPE WAS PUT TO DEATH THE MAN WHO WITHOUT SIN WAS BORN AND LIVED
82-121544-0121 HERE IT IS MORN WHEN IT IS EVENING THERE
82-121544-0122 STILL FIXED REMAINETH AS HE WAS BEFORE UPON THIS SIDE HE FELL DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN
82-121544-0123 FOR FEAR OF HIM MADE OF THE SEA A VEIL AND CAME TO OUR HEMISPHERE AND PERADVENTURE TO FLEE FROM HIM
82-121544-0124 A PLACE THERE IS BELOW FROM BEELZEBUB AS FAR RECEDING AS THE TOMB EXTENDS WHICH NOT BY SIGHT IS KNOWN
82-121544-0125 OF A SMALL RIVULET THAT THERE DESCENDETH
82-121544-0126 THE GUIDE AND I INTO THAT HIDDEN ROAD NOW ENTERED TO RETURN TO THE BRIGHT WORLD AND WITHOUT CARE OF HAVING ANY REST WE MOUNTED UP HE FIRST AND I THE SECOND
82-121544-0127 TILL I BEHELD THROUGH A ROUND APERTURE SOME OF THE BEAUTEOUS THINGS THAT HEAVEN DOTH BEAR
