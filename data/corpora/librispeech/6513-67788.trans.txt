6513-67788-0000 AND SHE HAD ENLARGED OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDYING THE NOBLE EXAMPLE SET BEFORE HER BY SLOWBRIDGE ON HIS ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK MARTIN BASSETT TELEGRAPHED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND SISTER PER ATLANTIC CABLE INFORMING THEM THAT HE MIGHT BE DETAINED A COUPLE OF MONTHS
6513-67788-0001 AND BIDDING THEM TO BE OF GOOD CHEER THE ARRIVAL OF THE MESSAGE IN ITS OFFICIAL ENVELOPE SO ALARMED MISS BELINDA
6513-67788-0002 WHILE IT WAS READ TO HER BY OCTAVIA WHO RECEIVED IT WITHOUT ANY SURPRISE WHATEVER FOR SOME TIME AFTER ITS COMPLETION SLOWBRIDGE HAD PRIVATELY DISBELIEVED IN THE ATLANTIC CABLE
6513-67788-0003 AND UNTIL THIS OCCASION HAD CERTAINLY DISBELIEVED IN THE EXISTENCE OF PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED MESSAGES THROUGH IT IN FACT
6513-67788-0004 MISS BELINDA HAD MADE IMMEDIATE PREPARATIONS FOR FAINTING QUIETLY AWAY BEING FULLY CONVINCED THAT A SHIPWRECK HAD OCCURRED
6513-67788-0005 AND THAT HIS EXECUTORS HAD CHOSEN THIS DELICATE METHOD OF BREAKING THE NEWS
6513-67788-0006 TRUST IN PROVIDENCE MY LOVE AND AND BEAR UP AH HOW I WISH I HAD A STRONGER MIND AND COULD BE OF MORE SERVICE TO YOU
6513-67788-0007 NOTHING IS THE MATTER HE'S ALL RIGHT HE GOT IN ON SATURDAY AH PANTED MISS BELINDA ARE YOU QUITE SURE MY DEAR ARE YOU QUITE SURE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS LISTEN
6513-67788-0008 GOT IN SATURDAY PIPER MET ME SHARES LOOKING UP MAY BE KEPT HERE TWO MONTHS WILL WRITE KEEP UP YOUR SPIRITS MARTIN BASSETT THANK HEAVEN SIGHED MISS BELINDA THANK HEAVEN WHY
6513-67788-0009 SAID OCTAVIA WHY ECHOED MISS BELINDA AH MY DEAR IF YOU KNEW HOW TERRIFIED I WAS I FELT SURE THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED A CABLE MESSAGE MY DEAR
6513-67788-0010 I NEVER RECEIVED A TELEGRAM IN MY LIFE BEFORE AND TO RECEIVE A CABLE MESSAGE WAS REALLY A SHOCK WELL I DON'T SEE WHY SAID OCTAVIA IT SEEMS TO ME IT IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER MESSAGE MISS BELINDA REGARDED HER TIMIDLY
6513-67788-0011 DOES YOUR PAPA OFTEN SEND THEM SHE INQUIRED
6513-67788-0012 I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S CHEAP OCTAVIA REPLIED BUT IT SAVES TIME AND WORRY
6513-67788-0013 VERY TRUE SAID MISS BELINDA BUT
6513-67788-0014 HER SIMPLE IDEAS OF ECONOMY AND QUIET LIVING WERE FREQUENTLY UPSET IN THESE TIMES
6513-67788-0015 AND YET OCTAVIA HAD NOT BEEN DOING ANY THING AT ALL REMARKABLE IN HER OWN EYES AND CONSIDERED HER LIFE PRETTY DULL IF THE ELDER MISS BASSETT HER PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS HAD NOT BEEN SO THOROUGHLY WELL KNOWN AND SO UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED
6513-67788-0016 THERE IS AN AWFUL POSSIBILITY THAT SLOWBRIDGE MIGHT EVEN HAVE GONE SO FAR AS NOT TO ASK OCTAVIA OUT TO TEA AT ALL BUT EVEN LADY THEOBALD FELT THAT IT WOULD NOT DO TO SLIGHT BELINDA BASSETT'S NIECE AND GUEST
6513-67788-0017 AND PLACE HER THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THIS YOUNG LADY WHO ALONE DESERVED CONDEMNATION BEYOND THE PALE OF ALL SOCIAL LAW IT IS ONLY TO BE REGRETTED SAID HER LADYSHIP THAT BELINDA BASSETT HAS NOT ARRANGED THINGS BETTER
6513-67788-0018 IN SECRET LUCIA FELT MUCH SOFT HEARTED SYMPATHY FOR BOTH MISS BASSETT AND HER GUEST
6513-67788-0019 IT REALLY DID NOT SEEM PROBABLE
6513-67788-0020 OR THAT SHE HAD IN A DISTINCT MANNER
6513-67788-0021 PERHAPS DEAR GRANDMAMMA THE GIRL VENTURED IT IS BECAUSE MISS OCTAVIA BASSETT IS SO YOUNG THAT MAY I ASK INQUIRED LADY THEOBALD IN FELL TONES HOW OLD YOU ARE I WAS NINETEEN IN IN DECEMBER
6513-67788-0022 MISS OCTAVIA BASSETT SAID HER LADYSHIP WAS NINETEEN LAST OCTOBER AND IT IS NOW JUNE I HAVE NOT YET FOUND IT NECESSARY TO APOLOGIZE FOR YOU ON THE SCORE OF YOUTH
6513-67788-0023 AND SET AN EVENING FOR ENTERTAINING MISS BELINDA AND HER NIECE IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHER LADIES WITH THE BEST BOHEA THIN BREAD AND BUTTER PLUM CAKE AND VARIOUS OTHER DELICACIES WHAT DO THEY DO AT SUCH PLACES ASKED OCTAVIA
6513-67788-0024 HALF PAST FIVE IS PRETTY EARLY WE SPEND SOME TIME AT THE TEA TABLE MY DEAR EXPLAINED MISS BELINDA
6513-67788-0025 I FEEL AS IF I WERE NOT CLEVER ENOUGH AND I GET FLURRIED TOO EASILY BY BY DIFFERENCES OF OPINION
6513-67788-0026 SHE WAS REALLY NO FONDER OF MASCULINE SOCIETY THAN THE GENERALITY OF GIRLS BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP WONDERING IF THERE WOULD BE ANY YOUNG MEN PRESENT AND IF INDEED
6513-67788-0027 THERE WERE ANY YOUNG MEN IN SLOWBRIDGE WHO MIGHT POSSIBLY BE PRODUCED UPON FESTIVE OCCASIONS EVEN THOUGH ORDINARILY KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND SHE HAD NOT HEARD MISS BELINDA MENTION ANY MASCULINE NAME SO FAR
6513-67788-0028 BUT THAT OF THE CURATE OF SAINT JAMES'S AND WHEN SHE HAD SEEN HIM PASS THE HOUSE SHE HAD NOT FOUND HIS SLIM BLACK FIGURE AND FAINT ECCLESIASTIC WHISKERS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING
6513-67788-0029 A TEA AT LADY THEOBALD'S HOUSE CONSTITUTED FORMAL PRESENTATION TO THE SLOWBRIDGE WORLD EACH YOUNG LADY WITHIN THE PALE OF GENTEEL SOCIETY HAVING ARRIVED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION ON RETURNING HOME FROM BOARDING SCHOOL
6513-67788-0030 WAS INVITED TO TEA AT OLDCLOUGH HALL DURING AN ENTIRE EVENING SHE WAS THE SUBJECT OF WATCHFUL CRITICISM HER DEPORTMENT WAS REMARKED HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS DISPLAYED SHE PERFORMED HER LAST NEW PIECES UPON THE PIANO
6513-67788-0031 SHE WAS DRAWN INTO CONVERSATION BY HER HOSTESS AND UPON THE TIMID MODESTY OF HER REPLIES AND THE REVERENCE OF HER LISTENING ATTITUDES DEPENDED HER FUTURE SOCIAL STATUS
6513-67788-0032 SO IT WAS VERY NATURAL INDEED THAT MISS BELINDA SHOULD BE ANXIOUS I WOULD WEAR SOMETHING RATHER QUIET AND AND SIMPLE MY DEAR OCTAVIA SHE SAID A WHITE MUSLIN PERHAPS WITH BLUE RIBBONS
6513-67788-0033 I'VE GOT ONE THAT WOULD DO IF IT'S WARM ENOUGH TO WEAR IT I BOUGHT IT IN NEW YORK BUT IT CAME FROM PARIS I'VE NEVER WORN IT YET
6513-67788-0034 NOTHING IS SO CHARMING IN THE DRESS OF A YOUNG GIRL AS PURE SIMPLICITY OUR SLOWBRIDGE YOUNG LADIES RARELY WEAR ANY THING BUT WHITE FOR EVENING
6513-67788-0035 ALL AFTER ONE SIMPLE DESIGN OF HER OWN
6513-67788-0036 I SHOULD BE GLAD ONE OF THE FIFTEEN DIDN'T BELONG TO ME I SHOULD FEEL AS IF PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WHEN I CAME INTO A ROOM GOOD GRACIOUS THERE'S ANOTHER THE FIRST WAS MADE FOR MISS LUCIA GASTON WHO IS LADY THEOBALD'S NIECE REPLIED MISS BELINDA MILDLY
6513-67788-0037 I THINK I SHOULD DRAW THE LINE THERE BUT SHE SAID IT WITHOUT ANY ILL NATURE AND SENSITIVE AS MISS BELINDA WAS UPON THE SUBJECT OF HER CHERISHED IDEALS SHE COULD NOT TAKE OFFENCE
6513-67788-0038 IN THE MOST ORNATE AND STARTLING MANNER IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT ONLY LADY THEOBALD'S FINE APPRECIATION OF MISS BELINDA BASSETT'S FEELINGS
6513-67788-0039 I WOULD PREFER MY DEAR SAID MORE THAN ONE DISCREET MATRON TO HER DAUGHTER AS THEY ATTIRED THEMSELVES
6513-67788-0040 BEFORE WE KNOW HOW THIS YOUNG LADY MAY TURN OUT LET YOUR MANNER TOWARD HER BE KIND BUT NOT FAMILIAR IT IS WELL TO BE UPON THE SAFE SIDE WHAT PRECISE LINE OF CONDUCT IT WAS GENERALLY ANTICIPATED
6513-67788-0041 THAT THIS GOLD DIGGING AND SILVER MINING YOUNG PERSON WOULD ADOPT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT THE GENERAL SENTIMENTS REGARDING HER WERE OF A DISTRUSTFUL IF NOT TIMOROUS NATURE TO MISS BASSETT
6513-67788-0042 WHO FELT ALL THIS IN THE VERY AIR SHE BREATHED THE GIRL'S INNOCENCE OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS WAS EVEN A LITTLE TOUCHING WITH ALL HER SPLENDOR SHE WAS NOT AT ALL HARD TO PLEASE
6513-67788-0043 AND HAD QUITE AWAKENED TO AN INTEREST IN THE IMPENDING SOCIAL EVENT SHE SEEMED IN GOOD SPIRITS AND TALKED MORE THAN WAS HER CUSTOM
6513-67788-0044 GIVING MISS BELINDA GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF VARIOUS FESTAL GATHERINGS SHE HAD ATTENDED IN NEW YORK WHEN SHE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN VERY GAY INDEED AND TO HAVE WORN VERY BEAUTIFUL DRESSES AND ALSO TO HAVE HAD RATHER MORE THAN HER SHARE OF PARTNERS
6513-67788-0045 THE PHRASES SHE USED AND THE DANCES SHE DESCRIBED WERE ALL STRANGE TO MISS BELINDA AND TENDED TO REDUCING HER TO A BEWILDERED CONDITION IN WHICH SHE FELT MUCH TIMID AMAZEMENT AT THE INTREPIDITY OF THE NEW YORK YOUNG LADIES
6513-67788-0046 AND NO SLIGHT SUSPICION OF THE GERMAN AS A THEATRICAL KIND OF DANCE INVOLVING EXTRAORDINARY FIGURES AND AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF ATTENTION FROM PARTNERS OF THE STRONGER SEX
6513-67788-0047 IT MUST BE ADMITTED HOWEVER THAT BY THIS TIME NOTWITHSTANDING THE VARIOUS SHOCKS SHE HAD RECEIVED MISS BELINDA HAD BEGUN TO DISCOVER IN HER YOUNG GUEST DIVERS GOOD QUALITIES WHICH APPEALED TO HER AFFECTIONATE AND SUSCEPTIBLE OLD HEART
6513-67788-0048 IN THE FIRST PLACE THE GIRL HAD NO SMALL AFFECTATIONS INDEED IF SHE HAD BEEN LESS UNAFFECTED SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LESS SUBJECT TO SEVERE COMMENT SHE WAS GOOD NATURED AND GENEROUS TO EXTRAVAGANCE
6513-67788-0049 HER MANNER TOWARD MARY ANNE NEVER CEASED TO AROUSE MISS BELINDA TO INTEREST THERE WAS NOT ANY CONDESCENSION WHATEVER IN IT AND YET IT COULD NOT BE CALLED A VULGARLY FAMILIAR MANNER IT WAS RATHER AN ASTONISHINGLY SIMPLE MANNER
6513-67788-0050 SOMEHOW SUGGESTIVE OF A SUBTILE RECOGNITION OF MARY ANNE'S YOUTH AND ILL LUCK IN NOT HAVING BEFORE HER MORE LIVELY PROSPECTS SHE GAVE MARY ANNE PRESENTS IN THE SHAPE OF ARTICLES OF CLOTHING
6513-67788-0051 AT WHICH SLOWBRIDGE WOULD HAVE EXCLAIMED IN HORROR IF THE RECIPIENT HAD DARED TO WEAR THEM BUT WHEN MISS BELINDA EXPRESSED HER REGRET AT THESE INDISCRETIONS OCTAVIA WAS QUITE WILLING TO RECTIFY HER MISTAKES
6513-67788-0052 AH WELL SHE SAID I CAN GIVE HER SOME MONEY AND SHE CAN BUY SOME THINGS FOR HERSELF WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO DO AND WHEN UNDER HER MISTRESS'S DIRECTION MARY ANNE PURCHASED A STOUT BROWN MERINO
6513-67788-0053 SHE TOOK QUITE AN INTEREST IN HER STRUGGLES AT MAKING IT I WOULDN'T MAKE IT SO SHORT IN THE WAIST AND SO FULL IN THE SKIRT IF I WERE YOU SHE SAID THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT SHOULDN'T FIT YOU KNOW THEREBY WINNING THE HOUSE MAIDEN'S UNDYING ADORATION
6513-67788-0054 AND ADDING MUCH TO THE SHAPELINESS OF THE GARMENT I AM SURE SHE HAS A GOOD HEART MISS BELINDA SAID TO HERSELF AS THE DAYS WENT BY SHE IS LIKE MARTIN IN THAT I DARE SAY SHE FINDS ME VERY IGNORANT AND SILLY
6513-67788-0055 BUT SHE NEVER SEEMS TO LAUGH AT ME NOR THINK OF ME UNKINDLY
