1961-145733-0000 THERE WAS ONCE A POOR PRINCE HE POSSESSED A KINGDOM WHICH THOUGH SMALL WAS YET LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO MARRY ON AND MARRIED HE WISHED TO BE NOW IT WAS CERTAINLY A LITTLE AUDACIOUS OF HIM TO VENTURE TO SAY TO THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER WILL YOU MARRY ME BUT HE DID VENTURE TO SAY SO
1961-145733-0001 FOR HIS NAME WAS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PRINCESSES WHO WOULD GLADLY HAVE SAID YES BUT WOULD SHE SAY THE SAME WELL WE SHALL SEE ON THE GRAVE OF THE PRINCE'S FATHER GREW A ROSE TREE A VERY BEAUTIFUL ROSE TREE
1961-145733-0002 IT ONLY BLOOMED EVERY FIVE YEARS AND THEN BORE BUT A SINGLE ROSE BUT OH SUCH A ROSE ITS SCENT WAS SO SWEET THAT WHEN YOU SMELT IT YOU FORGOT ALL YOUR CARES AND TROUBLES AND HE HAD ALSO A NIGHTINGALE
1961-145733-0003 WHICH COULD SING AS IF ALL THE BEAUTIFUL MELODIES IN THE WORLD WERE SHUT UP IN ITS LITTLE THROAT THIS ROSE AND THIS NIGHTINGALE THE PRINCESS WAS TO HAVE AND SO THEY WERE BOTH PUT INTO SILVER CASKETS AND SENT TO HER
1961-145733-0004 HERE COMES A DUKE A RIDING WITH HER LADIES IN WAITING
1961-145733-0005 SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS FOR JOY IF ONLY IT WERE A LITTLE PUSSY CAT SHE SAID BUT THE ROSE TREE WITH THE BEAUTIFUL ROSE CAME OUT BUT HOW PRETTILY IT IS MADE SAID ALL THE LADIES IN WAITING IT IS MORE THAN PRETTY SAID THE EMPEROR IT IS CHARMING
1961-145733-0006 BUT THE PRINCESS FELT IT AND THEN SHE ALMOST BEGAN TO CRY
1961-145733-0007 ANGRY THOUGHT THE EMPEROR AND THERE CAME OUT THE NIGHTINGALE IT SANG SO BEAUTIFULLY THAT ONE COULD SCARCELY UTTER A CROSS WORD AGAINST IT
1961-145733-0008 AH YES IT IS THE SAME TONE THE SAME EXECUTION YES SAID THE EMPEROR AND THEN HE WEPT LIKE A LITTLE CHILD I HOPE THAT THIS AT LEAST IS NOT REAL ASKED THE PRINCESS YES IT IS A REAL BIRD SAID THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT IT
1961-145733-0009 AND SHE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT ALLOW THE PRINCE TO COME BUT HE WAS NOTHING DAUNTED HE PAINTED HIS FACE BROWN AND BLACK DREW HIS CAP WELL OVER HIS FACE AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR GOOD DAY EMPEROR HE SAID
1961-145733-0010 I WILL THINK OF YOU STAY IT HAS JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WANT SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER THE SWINE FOR I HAVE SO VERY MANY OF THEM AND THE PRINCE GOT THE SITUATION OF IMPERIAL SWINEHERD HE HAD A WRETCHED LITTLE ROOM CLOSE TO THE PIGSTIES
1961-145733-0011 HERE HE HAD TO STAY BUT THE WHOLE DAY HE SAT WORKING AND WHEN EVENING WAS COME HE HAD MADE A PRETTY LITTLE POT ALL ROUND IT WERE LITTLE BELLS AND WHEN THE POT BOILED THEY JINGLED MOST BEAUTIFULLY AND PLAYED THE OLD TUNE WHERE IS AUGUSTUS DEAR
1961-145733-0012 ALAS HE'S NOT HERE HERE HERE BUT THE MOST WONDERFUL THING WAS THAT WHEN ONE HELD ONE'S FINGER IN THE STEAM OF THE POT THEN AT ONCE ONE COULD SMELL WHAT DINNER WAS READY IN ANY FIRE PLACE IN THE TOWN
1961-145733-0013 THAT WAS INDEED SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE ROSE NOW THE PRINCESS CAME WALKING PAST WITH ALL HER LADIES IN WAITING AND WHEN SHE HEARD THE TUNE SHE STOOD STILL AND HER FACE BEAMED WITH JOY FOR SHE ALSO COULD PLAY WHERE IS AUGUSTUS DEAR
1961-145733-0014 WHY THAT IS WHAT I PLAY SHE SAID HE MUST BE A MOST ACCOMPLISHED SWINEHERD LISTEN GO DOWN AND ASK HIM WHAT THE INSTRUMENT COSTS AND ONE OF THE LADIES IN WAITING HAD TO GO DOWN BUT SHE PUT ON WOODEN CLOGS
1961-145733-0015 WHAT WILL YOU TAKE FOR THE POT ASKED THE LADY IN WAITING I WILL HAVE TEN KISSES FROM THE PRINCESS ANSWERED THE SWINEHERD HEAVEN FORBID SAID THE LADY IN WAITING YES I WILL SELL IT FOR NOTHING LESS REPLIED THE SWINEHERD WELL

1961-145733-0018 AND THE LADIES IN WAITING PLACED THEMSELVES IN FRONT AND THEN SPREAD OUT THEIR DRESSES SO THE SWINEHERD GOT HIS TEN KISSES AND SHE GOT THE POT WHAT HAPPINESS THAT WAS THE WHOLE NIGHT AND THE WHOLE DAY THE POT WAS MADE TO BOIL
1961-145733-0019 THERE WAS NOT A FIRE PLACE IN THE WHOLE TOWN WHERE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS BEING COOKED WHETHER IT WAS AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OR AT THE SHOEMAKER'S THE LADIES IN WAITING DANCED AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS
1961-145733-0020 THAT IS TO SAY THE PRINCE THOUGH THEY DID NOT KNOW HE WAS ANYTHING BUT A TRUE SWINEHERD LET NO DAY PASS WITHOUT MAKING SOMETHING AND ONE DAY HE MADE A RATTLE
1961-145733-0021 I HAVE NEVER HEARD A MORE BEAUTIFUL COMPOSITION LISTEN GO DOWN AND ASK HIM WHAT THIS INSTRUMENT COSTS BUT I WON'T KISS HIM AGAIN HE WANTS A HUNDRED KISSES FROM THE PRINCESS SAID THE LADY IN WAITING WHO HAD GONE DOWN TO ASK HIM
1961-145733-0022 I BELIEVE HE IS MAD SAID THE PRINCESS AND THEN SHE WENT ON
1961-145733-0023 ONE OUGHT TO ENCOURAGE ART SHE SAID I AM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TELL HIM HE SHALL HAVE AS BEFORE TEN KISSES THE REST HE CAN TAKE FROM MY LADIES IN WAITING
1961-145733-0024 BUT WE DON'T AT ALL LIKE BEING KISSED BY HIM SAID THE LADIES IN WAITING THAT'S NONSENSE SAID THE PRINCESS AND IF I CAN KISS HIM YOU CAN TOO
1961-145733-0025 HE RUBBED HIS EYES AND PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES WHY THOSE ARE THE LADIES IN WAITING PLAYING THEIR GAMES I MUST GO DOWN TO THEM SO HE TOOK OFF HIS SHOES WHICH WERE SHOES THOUGH HE HAD TRODDEN THEM DOWN INTO SLIPPERS
1961-145733-0026 WHAT A HURRY HE WAS IN TO BE SURE AS SOON AS HE CAME INTO THE YARD HE WALKED VERY SOFTLY AND THE LADIES IN WAITING WERE SO BUSY COUNTING THE KISSES AND SEEING FAIR PLAY THAT THEY NEVER NOTICED THE EMPEROR HE STOOD ON TIPTOE
1961-145733-0027 THEN SHE STOOD STILL AND WEPT THE SWINEHERD WAS SCOLDING AND THE RAIN WAS STREAMING DOWN ALAS WHAT AN UNHAPPY CREATURE I AM SOBBED THE PRINCESS IF ONLY I HAD TAKEN THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCE
1961-145733-0028 ALAS HOW UNFORTUNATE I AM AND THE SWINEHERD WENT BEHIND A TREE WASHED THE BLACK AND BROWN OFF HIS FACE THREW AWAY HIS OLD CLOTHES AND THEN STEPPED FORWARD IN HIS SPLENDID DRESS LOOKING SO BEAUTIFUL THAT THE PRINCESS WAS OBLIGED TO COURTESY
