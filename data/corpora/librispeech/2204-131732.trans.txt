2204-131732-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE THE SOCIAL SIDE OF EDISON THE TITLE OF THIS CHAPTER MIGHT IMPLY THAT THERE IS AN UNSOCIAL SIDE TO EDISON IN A SENSE THIS IS TRUE
2204-131732-0001 IS LIKELY TO REALIZE HIS UTTER INSIGNIFICANCE AND BE SENT AWAY WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING HIS OBJECT BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING EDISON IS EASY TOLERANCE ITSELF
2204-131732-0002 TO MAKE ANY DEMANDS ON HIS TIME MAN IS A SOCIAL ANIMAL AND THAT DESCRIBES EDISON BUT IT DOES NOT DESCRIBE ACCURATELY THE INVENTOR ASKING TO BE LET ALONE EDISON NEVER SOUGHT SOCIETY
2204-131732-0003 BUT SOCIETY HAS NEVER CEASED TO SEEK HIM AND TO DAY AS EVER THE PRESSURE UPON HIM TO GIVE UP HIS WORK AND RECEIVE HONORS MEET DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE OR ATTEND PUBLIC FUNCTIONS IS INTENSE
2204-131732-0004 ONLY TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO A FLATTERING INVITATION CAME FROM ONE OF THE GREAT ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES TO RECEIVE A DEGREE BUT AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS DEEP IN EXPERIMENTS ON HIS NEW STORAGE BATTERY AND NOTHING COULD BUDGE HIM
2204-131732-0005 HE WOULD NOT DROP THE WORK AND WHILE HIGHLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROPOSED HONOR LET IT GO BY RATHER THAN QUIT FOR A WEEK OR TWO THE STERN DRUDGERY OF PROBING FOR THE FACT AND THE TRUTH WHETHER ONE APPROVES OR NOT IT IS AT LEAST ADMIRABLE STOICISM
2204-131732-0006 OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS TOO LITTLE A SIMILAR INSTANCE IS THAT OF A VISIT PAID TO THE LABORATORY BY SOME ONE BRINGING A GOLD MEDAL FROM A FOREIGN SOCIETY
2204-131732-0007 AT LAST EDISON WAS OVERPERSUADED AND ALL DIRTY AND PERSPIRING AS HE WAS RECEIVED THE MEDAL RATHER THAN CAUSE THE VISITOR TO COME AGAIN ON ONE OCCASION RECEIVING A MEDAL IN NEW YORK EDISON FORGOT IT ON THE FERRY BOAT AND LEFT IT BEHIND HIM
2204-131732-0008 A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN EDISON HAD RECEIVED THE ALBERT MEDAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS ONE OF THE PRESENT AUTHORS CALLED AT THE LABORATORY TO SEE IT NOBODY KNEW WHERE IT WAS HOURS PASSED BEFORE IT COULD BE FOUND
2204-131732-0009 AND WHEN AT LAST THE ACCOMPANYING LETTER WAS PRODUCED IT HAD AN OFFICE DATE STAMP RIGHT OVER THE SIGNATURE OF THE ROYAL PRESIDENT A VISITOR TO THE LABORATORY WITH ONE OF THESE MEDALLIC AWARDS ASKED EDISON IF HE HAD ANY OTHERS OH YES HE SAID I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUARTS MORE UP AT THE HOUSE
2204-131732-0010 ALL THIS SOUNDS LIKE LACK OF APPRECIATION BUT IT IS ANYTHING ELSE THAN THAT WHILE IN PARIS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE HE WORE THE DECORATION OF THE LEGION OF HONOR WHENEVER OCCASION REQUIRED
2204-131732-0011 BUT AT ALL OTHER TIMES TURNED THE BADGE UNDER HIS LAPEL BECAUSE HE HATED TO HAVE FELLOW AMERICANS THINK HE WAS SHOWING OFF AND ANY ONE WHO KNOWS EDISON WILL BEAR TESTIMONY TO HIS UTTER ABSENCE OF OSTENTATION
2204-131732-0012 THERE WILL BE FOUND AT GLENMONT MANY OTHER SIGNAL TOKENS OF ESTEEM AND GOOD WILL A BEAUTIFUL CIGAR CASE FROM THE LATE TSAR OF RUSSIA BRONZES FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN STEEL TROPHIES FROM KRUPP
2204-131732-0013 WHEN THE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LIGHT WERE GOING ON AT MENLO PARK SARAH BERNHARDT CAME TO AMERICA ONE EVENING ROBERT L CUTTING OF NEW YORK BROUGHT HER OUT TO SEE THE LIGHT SHE WAS A TERRIFIC RUBBERNECK
2204-131732-0014 SHE JUMPED ALL OVER THE MACHINERY AND I HAD ONE MAN ESPECIALLY TO GUARD HER DRESS SHE WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING SHE WOULD SPEAK IN FRENCH AND CUTTING WOULD TRANSLATE INTO ENGLISH SHE STAYED THERE ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF BERNHARDT GAVE ME TWO PICTURES PAINTED BY HERSELF
2204-131732-0015 WHICH SHE SENT ME FROM PARIS REFERENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE TO THE CALLERS UPON EDISON AND TO GIVE SIMPLY THE NAMES OF PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WOULD FILL MANY PAGES OF THIS RECORD SOME WERE MERE CONSUMERS OF TIME
2204-131732-0016 OTHERS WERE GLADLY WELCOMED LIKE LORD KELVIN THE GREATEST PHYSICIST OF THE LAST CENTURY WITH WHOM EDISON WAS ALWAYS IN FRIENDLY COMMUNICATION THE FIRST TIME I SAW LORD KELVIN
2204-131732-0017 THEREBY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE RAPIDITY OF ELECTRICITY TO PERFORM OPERATIONS ON MY LOCAL WIRE I GOT IT TO WORK VERY NICELY WHEN SIR WILLIAM THOMSON KELVIN CAME IN THE ROOM
2204-131732-0018 HE WAS INTRODUCED TO ME AND HAD A NUMBER OF FRIENDS WITH HIM HE SAID WHAT HAVE YOU HERE I TOLD HIM BRIEFLY WHAT IT WAS HE THEN TURNED AROUND AND TO MY GREAT SURPRISE EXPLAINED THE WHOLE THING TO HIS FRIENDS
2204-131732-0019 QUITE A DIFFERENT EXHIBITION WAS GIVEN TWO WEEKS LATER BY ANOTHER WELL KNOWN ENGLISHMAN ALSO AN ELECTRICIAN WHO CAME IN WITH HIS FRIENDS AND I WAS TRYING FOR TWO HOURS TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM AND FAILED AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
2204-131732-0020 EDISON WAS MORE THAN EVER IN DEMAND SOCIALLY BUT HE SHUNNED FUNCTIONS LIKE THE PLAGUE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH WORK BUT BECAUSE OF HIS DEAFNESS SOME DINNERS HE HAD TO ATTEND BUT A MAN WHO ATE LITTLE AND HEARD LESS
2204-131732-0021 COULD DERIVE PRACTICALLY NO PLEASURE FROM THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON CHILDS WAS VERY ANXIOUS I SHOULD GO DOWN TO PHILADELPHIA TO DINE WITH HIM I SELDOM WENT TO DINNERS HE INSISTED I SHOULD GO THAT A SPECIAL CAR WOULD LEAVE NEW YORK
2204-131732-0022 IT WAS FOR ME TO MEET MISTER JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN WE HAD THE PRIVATE CAR OF MISTER ROBERTS PRESIDENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD WE HAD ONE OF THOSE CELEBRATED DINNERS THAT ONLY MISTER CHILDS COULD GIVE AND I HEARD SPEECHES FROM CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE
2204-131732-0023 WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE DEPOT MISTER ROBERTS WAS THERE AND INSISTED ON CARRYING MY SATCHEL FOR ME I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND THAT AMONG THE MORE DISTINGUISHED VISITORS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHTING PERIOD WAS PRESIDENT DIAZ WITH WHOM EDISON BECAME QUITE INTIMATE
2204-131732-0024 PRESIDENT DIAZ OF MEXICO VISITED THIS COUNTRY WITH MISSUS DIAZ A HIGHLY EDUCATED AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHE SPOKE VERY GOOD ENGLISH THEY BOTH TOOK A DEEP INTEREST IN ALL THEY SAW I DON'T KNOW HOW IT EVER CAME ABOUT
2204-131732-0025 BUT I SEEMED TO BE DELEGATED TO SHOW THEM AROUND I TOOK THEM TO RAILROAD BUILDINGS ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANTS FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND SHOWED THEM A GREAT VARIETY OF THINGS IT LASTED TWO DAYS OF ANOTHER VISIT EDISON SAYS
2204-131732-0026 SITTING BULL AND FIFTEEN SIOUX INDIANS CAME TO WASHINGTON TO SEE THE GREAT FATHER AND THEN TO NEW YORK AND WENT TO THE GOERCK STREET WORKS WE COULD MAKE SOME VERY GOOD PYROTECHNICS THERE SO WE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE INDIANS A SCARE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
2204-131732-0027 WE HAD AN ARC THERE OF A MOST TERRIFYING CHARACTER BUT THEY NEVER MOVED A MUSCLE ANOTHER EPISODE AT GOERCK STREET DID NOT FIND THE VISITORS QUITE SO STOICAL
2204-131732-0028 IN TESTING DYNAMOS AT GOERCK STREET WE HAD A LONG FLAT BELT RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE FLOOR ABOUT FOUR INCHES ABOVE IT AND TRAVELLING FOUR THOUSAND FEET A MINUTE ONE DAY ONE OF THE DIRECTORS BROUGHT IN THREE OR FOUR LADIES TO THE WORKS TO SEE THE NEW ELECTRIC LIGHT SYSTEM
2204-131732-0029 AND A LITTLE FLAT PIECE OF LEATHER CAME OUT AND THE LADIES FAINTED A VERY INTERESTING PERIOD ON THE SOCIAL SIDE WAS THE VISIT PAID BY EDISON AND HIS FAMILY TO EUROPE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE
2204-131732-0030 WHEN HE HAD MADE A SPLENDID EXHIBIT OF HIS INVENTIONS AND APPARATUS AT THE GREAT PARIS CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION OF THAT YEAR TO THE EXTREME DELIGHT OF THE FRENCH WHO WELCOMED HIM WITH OPEN ARMS
2204-131732-0031 SO THAT THE CROWNED HEADS WERE CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR ABSENCE IT WAS NOT OF COURSE BY WAY OF THEATRICAL ANTITHESIS THAT EDISON APPEARED IN PARIS AT SUCH A TIME BUT THE CONTRAST WAS NONE THE LESS STRIKING AND EFFECTIVE
2204-131732-0032 IT WAS FELT THAT AFTER ALL THAT WHICH THE GREAT EXPOSITION EXEMPLIFIED AT ITS BEST THE TRIUMPH OF GENIUS OVER MATTER OVER IGNORANCE OVER SUPERSTITION MET WITH ITS DUE RECOGNITION WHEN EDISON CAME TO PARTICIPATE
2204-131732-0033 AND TO FELICITATE A NOBLE NATION THAT COULD SHOW SO MUCH IN THE VICTORIES OF CIVILIZATION AND THE ARTS DESPITE ITS LONG TRIALS AND ITS LONG STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT EDISON WAS GREETED WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC HOMAGE OF THE WHOLE FRENCH PEOPLE
2204-131732-0034 THEY COULD FIND NO PRAISE WARM ENOUGH FOR THE MAN WHO HAD ORGANIZED THE ECHOES AND TAMED THE LIGHTNING AND WHOSE CAREER WAS SO PICTURESQUE WITH EVENTFUL AND ROMANTIC DEVELOPMENT
2204-131732-0035 COVERED SEVERAL THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IN THE VAST MACHINERY HALL AND WAS CENTRED AROUND A HUGE EDISON LAMP BUILT OF MYRIADS OF SMALLER LAMPS OF THE ORDINARY SIZE
2204-131732-0036 SEVERAL INSTRUMENTS WERE PROVIDED AND EVERY DAY ALL DAY LONG WHILE THE EXPOSITION LASTED QUEUES OF EAGER VISITORS FROM EVERY QUARTER OF THE GLOBE WERE WAITING TO HEAR THE LITTLE MACHINE TALK AND SING AND REPRODUCE THEIR OWN VOICES
2204-131732-0037 NEVER BEFORE WAS SUCH A COLLECTION OF THE LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD MADE IT WAS THE FIRST LINGUISTIC CONCOURSE SINCE BABEL TIMES WE MUST LET EDISON TELL THE STORY OF SOME OF HIS EXPERIENCES
2204-131732-0038 I MADE A PERSONAL EXHIBIT COVERING ABOUT AN ACRE AS I HAD NO INTENTION OF OFFERING TO SELL ANYTHING I WAS SHOWING AND WAS PUSHING NO COMPANIES THE WHOLE EXHIBITION WAS MADE FOR HONOR AND WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF PROFIT
2204-131732-0039 BUT THE PARIS NEWSPAPERS CAME AROUND AND WANTED PAY FOR NOTICES OF IT WHICH WE PROMPTLY REFUSED
2204-131732-0040 THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE LENT ME HIS PRIVATE BOX
2204-131732-0041 IT SEEMS THERE IS A LITTLE HOLE ON THE STAGE WITH A HOOD OVER IT IN WHICH THE PROMPTER SITS WHEN OPERA IS GIVEN IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS NOT OCCUPIED AND I WAS GIVEN THE POSITION IN THE PROMPTER'S SEAT AND SAW THE WHOLE BALLET AT CLOSE RANGE
2204-131732-0042 THE CITY OF PARIS GAVE ME A DINNER AT THE NEW HOTEL DE VILLE WHICH WAS ALSO LIGHTED WITH THE EDISON SYSTEM THEY HAD A VERY FINE INSTALLATION OF MACHINERY AS I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND OR SPEAK A WORD OF FRENCH
2204-131732-0043 I WENT TO SEE OUR MINISTER MISTER WHITELAW REID AND GOT HIM TO SEND A DEPUTY TO ANSWER FOR ME WHICH HE DID WITH MY GRATEFUL THANKS THEN THE TELEPHONE COMPANY GAVE ME A DINNER AND THE ENGINEERS OF FRANCE
2204-131732-0044 AND I ATTENDED THE DINNER CELEBRATING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DISCOVERY OF PHOTOGRAPHY THEN THEY SENT TO REID MY DECORATION AND THEY TRIED TO PUT A SASH ON ME BUT I COULD NOT STAND FOR THAT MY WIFE HAD ME WEAR THE LITTLE RED BUTTON BUT WHEN I SAW AMERICANS COMING
2204-131732-0045 IN THIS WAS A PIANO WHEN MY WIFE AND I ARRIVED AT THE TOP WE FOUND THAT GOUNOD THE COMPOSER WAS THERE WE STAYED A COUPLE OF HOURS AND GOUNOD SANG AND PLAYED FOR US WE SPENT A DAY AT MEUDON
2204-131732-0046 AN OLD PALACE GIVEN BY THE GOVERNMENT TO JANSEN THE ASTRONOMER HE OCCUPIED THREE ROOMS AND THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED HE HAD THE GRAND DINING ROOM FOR HIS LABORATORY HE SHOWED ME A GYROSCOPE HE HAD GOT UP
2204-131732-0047 WHICH MADE THE INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF FOUR THOUSAND REVOLUTIONS IN A SECOND A MODIFICATION OF THIS WAS AFTERWARD USED ON THE FRENCH ATLANTIC LINES FOR MAKING AN ARTIFICIAL HORIZON TO TAKE OBSERVATIONS FOR POSITION AT SEA
2204-131732-0048 AND I WENT AND HAD QUITE A CHAT WITH HIM I SAW A LARGE NUMBER OF PERSONS BEING INOCULATED AND ALSO THE WHOLE MODUS OPERANDI WHICH WAS VERY INTERESTING
2204-131732-0049 HIS FATHER WAS WITH HIM HE HAD BEEN BITTEN IN THE FACE AND WAS TAKING THE TREATMENT I SAID TO PASTEUR WILL HE LIVE NO SAID HE
2204-131732-0050 EDISON HAS NO OPINION TO OFFER AS AN EXPERT ON ART BUT HAS HIS OWN STANDARD OF TASTE
2204-131732-0051 AND I ATTENDED THE LUXEMBOURG WITH MODERN MASTERS WHICH I ENJOYED GREATLY TO MY MIND THE OLD MASTERS ARE NOT ART AND I SUSPECT THAT MANY OTHERS ARE OF THE SAME OPINION AND THAT THEIR VALUE IS IN THEIR SCARCITY
2204-131732-0052 AND IN THE VARIETY OF MEN WITH LOTS OF MONEY SOMEWHAT AKIN TO THIS IS A SHREWD COMMENT ON ONE FEATURE OF THE EXPOSITION I SPENT SEVERAL DAYS IN THE EXPOSITION AT PARIS I REMEMBER GOING TO THE EXHIBIT OF THE KIMBERLEY DIAMOND MINES
2204-131732-0053 AND THEY KINDLY PERMITTED ME TO TAKE DIAMONDS FROM SOME OF THE BLUE EARTH WHICH THEY WERE WASHING BY MACHINERY TO EXHIBIT THE MINE OPERATIONS I FOUND SEVERAL BEAUTIFUL DIAMONDS BUT THEY SEEMED A LITTLE LIGHT WEIGHT TO ME WHEN I WAS PICKING THEM OUT THEY WERE DIAMONDS FOR EXHIBITION PURPOSES
2204-131732-0054 PROBABLY GLASS THIS DID NOT ALTOGETHER COMPLETE THE EUROPEAN TRIP OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE FOR EDISON WISHED TO SEE HELMHOLTZ AFTER LEAVING PARIS WE WENT TO BERLIN THE FRENCH PAPERS THEN CAME OUT AND ATTACKED ME BECAUSE I WENT TO GERMANY
2204-131732-0055 WHEN I STARTED FROM BERLIN ON THE TRIP I BEGAN TO TELL AMERICAN STORIES SIEMENS WAS VERY FOND OF THESE STORIES AND WOULD LAUGH IMMENSELY AT THEM AND COULD SEE THE POINTS AND THE HUMOR BY HIS IMAGINATION BUT HELMHOLTZ COULD NOT SEE ONE OF THEM
2204-131732-0056 SIEMENS WOULD QUICKLY IN GERMAN EXPLAIN THE POINT BUT HELMHOLTZ COULD NOT SEE IT ALTHOUGH HE UNDERSTOOD ENGLISH WHICH SIEMENS COULD SPEAK STILL THE EXPLANATIONS WERE MADE IN GERMAN
2204-131732-0057 AT HEIDELBERG MY ASSISTANT MISTER WANGEMANN AN ACCOMPLISHED GERMAN AMERICAN SHOWED THE PHONOGRAPH BEFORE THE ASSOCIATION THEN CAME THE TRIP FROM THE CONTINENT TO ENGLAND OF WHICH THIS WILL CERTAINLY PASS AS A GRAPHIC PICTURE
2204-131732-0058 WHEN I CROSSED OVER TO ENGLAND I HAD HEARD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THE TERRORS OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AS REGARDS SEASICKNESS I HAD BEEN OVER THE OCEAN THREE TIMES AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT SEASICKNESS WAS SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED MYSELF
2204-131732-0059 I WAS TOLD THAT WHILE A MAN MIGHT NOT GET SEASICK ON THE OCEAN IF HE MET A GOOD STORM ON THE CHANNEL IT WOULD DO FOR HIM WHEN WE ARRIVED AT CALAIS TO CROSS OVER EVERYBODY MADE FOR THE RESTAURANT I DID NOT CARE ABOUT EATING
2204-131732-0060 I WALKED OUT AND TRIED TO FIND THE BOAT GOING ALONG THE DOCK I SAW TWO SMALL SMOKESTACKS STICKING UP AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A LITTLE BOAT WHERE IS THE STEAMER THAT GOES ACROSS THE CHANNEL THIS IS THE BOAT
2204-131732-0061 AND IT CERTAINLY LOOKED AWFUL TOUGH OUTSIDE I SAID TO THE MAN WILL THAT BOAT LIVE IN THAT SEA OH YES HE SAID BUT WE'VE HAD A BAD STORM SO I MADE UP MY MIND THAT PERHAPS I WOULD GET SICK THIS TIME
2204-131732-0062 THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE ENGLISH RAILROAD OWNING THIS LINE WAS FORBES WHO HEARD I WAS COMING OVER AND PLACED THE PRIVATE SALOON AT MY DISPOSAL THE MOMENT MY FAMILY GOT IN THE ROOM WITH THE FRENCH LADY'S MAID AND THE REST
2204-131732-0063 THEY COMMENCED TO GET SICK SO I FELT PRETTY SURE I WAS IN FOR IT WE STARTED OUT OF THE LITTLE INLET AND GOT INTO THE CHANNEL AND THAT BOAT WENT IN SEVENTEEN DIRECTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY I WAITED AWHILE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO OCCUR AND THEN WENT INTO THE SMOKING COMPARTMENT
2204-131732-0064 NOBODY WAS THERE BY AND BY THE FUN BEGAN SOUNDS OF ALL KINDS AND VARIETIES WERE HEARD IN EVERY DIRECTION THEY WERE ALL SICK THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE ABOARD
2204-131732-0065 I ASKED ONE OF THE WAITERS CONCERNING THE BOAT ITSELF AND WAS TAKEN TO SEE THE ENGINEER AND WENT DOWN TO LOOK AT THE ENGINES AND SAW THE CAPTAIN BUT I KEPT MOSTLY IN THE SMOKING ROOM
2204-131732-0066 AND EVERY TIME THEY SAW THAT THEY WOULD GO AWAY AND BEGIN AGAIN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IS A HOLY TERROR ALL RIGHT BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME I MUST BE OUT OF BALANCE WHILE IN PARIS EDISON HAD MET SIR JOHN PENDER THE ENGLISH CABLE KING
2204-131732-0067 I THINK HE MUST HAVE LIVED AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY SOLEMN BECAUSE I WENT OUT RIDING WITH HIM IN THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE AND STARTED IN TO TELL HIM AMERICAN STORIES ALTHOUGH HE WAS A SCOTCHMAN HE LAUGHED IMMODERATELY
2204-131732-0068 SO I WENT THERE AND SPENT TWO OR THREE DAYS TELLING HIM STORIES
2204-131732-0069 AND THEY INSISTED I SHOULD GIVE THEM SOME EXPRESSION OF MY VIEWS WHILE I GAVE THEM MY OPINION IT WAS RELUCTANTLY I DID NOT WANT TO DO SO I THOUGHT THAT COMMERCIALLY THE THING WAS TOO AMBITIOUS THAT FERRANTI'S IDEAS WERE TOO BIG JUST THEN
2204-131732-0070 AND HE WAS NO SMALL MAN INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED HERE THAT DURING THE SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE THE VARIOUS MANUFACTURING EDISON LIGHTING INTERESTS IN AMERICA WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER
2204-131732-0071 AND CONSOLIDATED IN THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY WITH A CAPITAL OF NO LESS THAN TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ON AN EIGHT PER CENT DIVIDEND BASIS
2204-131732-0072 REPRESENTED MUCH MORE THAN THAT SUM AND MADE A SPLENDID OUTLET FOR THE PRODUCT OF THE FACTORIES A FEW YEARS LATER CAME THE CONSOLIDATION WITH THE THOMSON HOUSTON INTERESTS IN THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY WHICH UNDER THE BRILLIANT AND VIGOROUS MANAGEMENT OF PRESIDENT C A COFFIN
2204-131732-0073 HAS BECOME ONE OF THE GREATEST MANUFACTURING INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WITH AN OUTPUT OF APPARATUS REACHING TOWARD SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THE NET RESULT OF BOTH FINANCIAL OPERATIONS WAS HOWEVER
2204-131732-0074 WAS THAT IT SEPARATED HIM FROM HIS OLD FRIEND AND ALLY BERGMANN WHO ON SELLING OUT SAW A GREAT FUTURE FOR HIMSELF IN GERMANY WENT THERE AND REALIZED IT EDISON HAS ALWAYS HAD AN AMUSED ADMIRATION FOR BERGMANN
2204-131732-0075 AND HIS SOCIAL SIDE IS OFTEN MADE EVIDENT BY HIS LOVE OF TELLING STORIES ABOUT THOSE DAYS OF STRUGGLE SOME OF THE STORIES WERE TOLD FOR THIS VOLUME BERGMANN CAME TO WORK FOR ME AS A BOY SAYS EDISON HE STARTED IN ON STOCK QUOTATION PRINTERS
2204-131732-0076 AS HE WAS A RAPID WORKMAN AND PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE CLOCK I TOOK A FANCY TO HIM AND GAVE HIM PIECE WORK HE CONTRIVED SO MANY LITTLE TOOLS TO CHEAPEN THE WORK THAT HE MADE LOTS OF MONEY
2204-131732-0077 I EVEN HELPED HIM GET UP TOOLS UNTIL IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS WAS TOO RAPID A PROCESS OF GETTING RID OF MY MONEY AS I HADN'T THE HEART TO CUT THE PRICE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY FAIR AFTER A YEAR OR SO
2204-131732-0078 BERGMANN GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO START A SMALL SHOP IN WOOSTER STREET NEW YORK AND IT WAS AT THIS SHOP THAT THE FIRST PHONOGRAPHS WERE MADE FOR SALE
2204-131732-0079 FINALLY CAME THE ELECTRIC LIGHT A DYNAMO WAS INSTALLED IN BERGMANN'S SHOP TO PERMIT HIM TO TEST THE VARIOUS SMALL DEVICES WHICH HE WAS THEN MAKING FOR THE SYSTEM HE RENTED POWER FROM A JEW WHO OWNED THE BUILDING
2204-131732-0080 POWER WAS SUPPLIED FROM A FIFTY HORSE POWER ENGINE TO OTHER TENANTS ON THE SEVERAL FLOORS SOON AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BIG DYNAMO MACHINE THE LANDLORD APPEARED IN THE SHOP AND INSISTED THAT BERGMANN WAS USING MORE POWER THAN HE WAS PAYING FOR
2204-131732-0081 AND SAID THAT LATELY THE BELT ON THE ENGINE WAS SLIPPING AND SQUEALING BERGMANN MAINTAINED THAT HE MUST BE MISTAKEN THE LANDLORD KEPT GOING AMONG HIS TENANTS AND FINALLY DISCOVERED THE DYNAMO
2204-131732-0082 BERGMANN GAVE HIM A WITHERING LOOK OF SCORN AND SAID COME HERE AND I WILL SHOW YOU THROWING OFF THE BELT AND DISCONNECTING THE WIRES HE SPUN THE ARMATURE AROUND BY HAND THERE SAID BERGMANN YOU SEE IT'S NOT HERE THAT YOU MUST LOOK FOR YOUR LOSS
2204-131732-0083 HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THAT MACHINE WHEN THE WIRES WERE CONNECTED COULD STOP HIS ENGINE SOON AFTER THE BUSINESS HAD GROWN SO LARGE THAT E H JOHNSON AND I WENT IN AS PARTNERS
2204-131732-0084 AND BERGMANN RENTED AN IMMENSE FACTORY BUILDING AT THE CORNER OF AVENUE B AND EAST SEVENTEENTH STREET NEW YORK SIX STORIES HIGH AND COVERING A QUARTER OF A BLOCK
2204-131732-0085 OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN WERE FINALLY EMPLOYED THIS SHOP WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL BOTH SCIENTIFICALLY AND FINANCIALLY BERGMANN WAS A MAN OF GREAT EXECUTIVE ABILITY AND CARRIED ECONOMY OF MANUFACTURE TO THE LIMIT
2204-131732-0086 ONE NEED NOT WONDER AT EDISON'S REMINISCENT REMARK THAT IN ANY TRADE ANY OF MY BOYS MADE WITH BERGMANN HE ALWAYS GOT THE BEST OF THEM NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS ONE TIME THERE WAS TO BE A CONVENTION OF THE MANAGERS OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES AT CHICAGO
2204-131732-0087 I HAD GOTTEN THEM IMMUNE TO IT BERGMANN HAD WON ALL THE MONEY AND WHEN THE PORTER CAME IN AND SAID CHICAGO
2204-131732-0088 BUT PERHAPS THIS FURTHER STORY IS A BETTER INDICATION OF DEVELOPED HUMOR AND SHREWDNESS A MAN BY THE NAME OF EPSTEIN HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF BUYING BRASS CHIPS AND TRIMMINGS FROM THE LATHES AND IN SOME WAY BERGMANN FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN CHEATED
2204-131732-0089 EPSTEIN WENT UP TO SEVERAL BOXES PILED FULL OF CHIPS AND SO HEAVY THAT HE COULD NOT LIFT EVEN ONE END OF A BOX NOW MISTER BERGMANN SAID EPSTEIN HOW MUCH FOR THE LOT
2204-131732-0090 NO AMOUNT OF ARGUMENT WOULD APPARENTLY CHANGE BERGMANN'S DETERMINATION TO SELL BY THE POUND BUT FINALLY EPSTEIN GOT UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THE LOT AND BERGMANN APPEARING AS IF DISGUSTED ACCEPTED AND MADE HIM COUNT OUT THE MONEY THEN HE SAID
2204-131732-0091 WELL EPSTEIN GOOD BYE I'VE GOT TO GO DOWN TO WALL STREET EPSTEIN AND HIS ASSISTANT THEN ATTEMPTED TO LIFT THE BOXES TO CARRY THEM OUT BUT COULDN'T AND THEN DISCOVERED THAT CALCULATIONS AS TO QUANTITY HAD BEEN THROWN OUT BECAUSE THE BOXES HAD ALL BEEN SCREWED DOWN TO THE FLOOR
2204-131732-0092 AND MOSTLY FILLED WITH BOARDS WITH A VENEER OF BRASS CHIPS
2204-131732-0093 AS HE WAS SUCH A SMART BUSINESS MAN AND THE SCHEME WAS SO INGENIOUS ONE DAY AS A JOKE I FILLED THREE OR FOUR SHEETS OF FOOLSCAP PAPER WITH A JUMBLE OF FIGURES AND TOLD BERGMANN THEY WERE CALCULATIONS SHOWING THE GREAT LOSS OF POWER FROM BLOWING THE FACTORY WHISTLE
2204-131732-0094 AND NEVER AFTER THAT WOULD HE PERMIT THE WHISTLE TO BLOW ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE SOCIAL SIDE IS AFFORDED IN THE FOLLOWING LITTLE SERIES OF PEN PICTURES OF THE SAME PLACE AND TIME I HAD MY LABORATORY AT THE TOP OF THE BERGMANN WORKS AFTER MOVING FROM MENLO PARK
2204-131732-0095 THE BUILDING WAS SIX STORIES HIGH MY FATHER CAME THERE WHEN HE WAS EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE THE OLD MAN HAD POWERFUL LUNGS IN FACT WHEN I WAS EXAMINED BY THE MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE
2204-131732-0096 BRINGS TO MIND ANOTHER INSTANCE OF SHREWDNESS MENTIONED BY EDISON WITH REGARD TO HIS NEWSBOY DAYS BEING ASKED WHETHER HE DID NOT GET IMPOSED UPON WITH BAD BANK BILLS HE REPLIED THAT HE SUBSCRIBED TO A BANK NOTE DETECTOR
2204-131732-0097 AND CONSULTED IT CLOSELY WHENEVER A NOTE OF ANY SIZE FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE WAS THEN LESS THAN FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THE CONVERSATIONS WITH EDISON THAT ELICITED THESE STORIES BROUGHT OUT SOME DETAILS AS TO PERIL THAT ATTENDS EXPERIMENTATION
2204-131732-0098 WHEN I STARTED AT MENLO I HAD AN ELECTRIC FURNACE FOR WELDING RARE METALS THAT I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT VERY CLEARLY I WAS IN THE DARK ROOM WHERE I HAD A LOT OF CHLORIDE OF SULPHUR A VERY CORROSIVE LIQUID
2204-131732-0099 I DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WOULD DECOMPOSE BY WATER I POURED IN A BEAKERFUL OF WATER AND THE WHOLE THING EXPLODED AND THREW A LOT OF IT INTO MY EYES I RAN TO THE HYDRANT LEANED OVER BACKWARD OPENED MY EYES
2204-131732-0100 I HAD USED AMMONIA AND BROMINE I DID NOT KNOW IT AT THE TIME BUT I HAD MADE BROMIDE OF NITROGEN I PUT THE LARGE BULK OF IT IN THREE FILTERS AND AFTER IT HAD BEEN WASHED AND ALL THE WATER HAD COME THROUGH THE FILTER
2204-131732-0101 I OPENED THE THREE FILTERS AND LAID THEM ON A HOT STEAM PLATE TO DRY WITH THE STUFF WHILE I AND MISTER SADLER ONE OF MY ASSISTANTS WERE WORKING NEAR IT THERE WAS A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT AND A VERY SMART EXPLOSION I SAID TO SADLER WHAT IS THAT
2204-131732-0102 I GRABBED THE WHOLE THING AND THREW IT IN THE SINK AND POURED WATER ON IT I SAVED A LITTLE OF IT AND FOUND IT WAS A TERRIFIC EXPLOSIVE THE REASON WHY THOSE LITTLE PRELIMINARY EXPLOSIONS TOOK PLACE WAS THAT A LITTLE HAD SPATTERED OUT ON THE EDGE OF THE FILTER PAPER
2204-131732-0103 AND HAD DRIED FIRST AND EXPLODED HAD THE MAIN BODY EXPLODED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING LEFT OF THE LABORATORY I WAS WORKING IN AT ANOTHER TIME I HAD A BRIQUETTING MACHINE FOR BRIQUETTING IRON ORE
2204-131732-0104 WITHIN AN INCH OF MY NOSE AND WENT CLEAR THROUGH A TWO INCH PLANK THAT WAS WITHIN AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE AS THEY SAY IN MY EXPERIMENTAL PLANT FOR CONCENTRATING IRON ORE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF NEW JERSEY WE HAD A VERTICAL DRIER
2204-131732-0105 SO I AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY MISTER MALLORY CROWDED THROUGH THE MANHOLE TO SEE WHY THE ORE WOULD NOT COME DOWN AFTER WE GOT IN THE ORE DID COME DOWN AND THERE WERE FOURTEEN TONS OF IT ABOVE US
2204-131732-0106 THE MEN OUTSIDE KNEW WE WERE IN THERE AND THEY HAD A GREAT TIME DIGGING US OUT AND GETTING AIR TO US SUCH INCIDENTS BROUGHT OUT IN NARRATION THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE MEN WORKING WITH HIM HAD BEEN LESS FORTUNATE
2204-131732-0107 PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAD EXPERIMENTED WITH THE ROENTGEN X RAY WHOSE RAVAGES LIKE THOSE OF LEPROSY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MUTILATION AND DEATH OF AT LEAST ONE EXPERT ASSISTANT IN THE EARLY DAYS OF WORK ON THE INCANDESCENT LAMP
2204-131732-0108 ALSO THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE WITH MERCURY I HAD A SERIES OF VACUUM PUMPS WORKED BY MERCURY AND USED FOR EXHAUSTING EXPERIMENTAL INCANDESCENT LAMPS THE MAIN PIPE WHICH WAS FULL OF MERCURY WAS ABOUT SEVEN AND ONE HALF FEET FROM THE FLOOR
2204-131732-0109 ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE PIPE WERE OUTLETS TO WHICH THICK RUBBER TUBING WAS CONNECTED EACH TUBE TO A PUMP ONE DAY WHILE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE MERCURY PUMP MY ASSISTANT AN AWKWARD COUNTRY LAD FROM A FARM ON STATEN ISLAND
2204-131732-0110 WHO HAD ADENOIDS IN HIS NOSE AND BREATHED THROUGH HIS MOUTH WHICH WAS ALWAYS WIDE OPEN WAS LOOKING UP AT THIS PIPE AT A SMALL LEAK OF MERCURY WHEN THE RUBBER TUBE CAME OFF AND PROBABLY TWO POUNDS OF MERCURY WENT INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT AND GOT THROUGH HIS SYSTEM SOMEHOW
2204-131732-0111 IN A SHORT TIME HE BECAME SALIVATED AND HIS TEETH GOT LOOSE HE WENT HOME AND SHORTLY HIS MOTHER APPEARED AT THE LABORATORY WITH A HORSEWHIP WHICH SHE PROPOSED TO USE ON THE PROPRIETOR I WAS FORTUNATELY ABSENT AND SHE WAS MOLLIFIED SOMEHOW BY MY OTHER ASSISTANTS
2204-131732-0112 BUT IT DID NO GOOD IN THIS CASE WHEN THE FIRST LAMP WORKS WERE STARTED AT MENLO PARK ONE OF MY EXPERIMENTS SEEMED TO SHOW THAT HOT MERCURY GAVE A BETTER VACUUM IN THE LAMP THAN COLD MERCURY I THEREUPON STARTED TO HEAT IT
2204-131732-0113 SOON ALL THE MEN GOT SALIVATED AND THINGS LOOKED SERIOUS BUT I FOUND THAT IN THE MIRROR FACTORIES WHERE MERCURY WAS USED EXTENSIVELY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT MADE THE GIVING OF IODIDE OF POTASSIUM COMPULSORY TO PREVENT SALIVATION
2204-131732-0114 IT WILL HAVE BEEN GATHERED THAT EDISON HAS OWED HIS SPECIAL IMMUNITY FROM OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES NOT ONLY TO LUCK BUT TO UNUSUAL POWERS OF ENDURANCE AND A STRONG PHYSIQUE INHERITED NO DOUBT FROM HIS FATHER
2204-131732-0115 MISTER MALLORY MENTIONS A LITTLE FACT THAT BEARS ON THIS EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY OF BODILY POWERS
