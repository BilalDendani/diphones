2587-160609-0000 THE STORY OF THE PARACHUTE IN GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THE UMBRELLA IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT TO OMIT MENTIONING ANOTHER AND FAR FROM LEGITIMATE USE IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN EMPLOYED BY NOTORIETY HUNTING ARTISTES WE ALLUDE TO THE PARACHUTE
2587-160609-0001 AND A SHORT NARRATION OF ITS ORIGIN AND PROGRESS MAY NOT BE UNINTERESTING TO OUR READERS THE PARACHUTE COMMONLY IN USE IS NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN A HUGE UMBRELLA PRESENTING A SURFACE OF SUFFICIENT DIMENSION TO EXPERIENCE FROM THE AIR
2587-160609-0002 A RESISTANCE EQUAL TO THE WEIGHT OF DESCENT IN MOVING THROUGH THE FLUID AT A VELOCITY NOT EXCEEDING THAT OF THE SHOCK WHICH A PERSON CAN SUSTAIN WITHOUT DANGER OR INJURY IT IS MADE OF SILK OR COTTON
2587-160609-0003 TO THE OUTER EDGE CORDS ARE FASTENED OF ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH AS THE DIAMETER OF THE MACHINE TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY EIGHT FEET
2587-160609-0004 AND MEETS THE CORDS FROM THE MARGIN ACTING IN FACT AS THE STICK OF THE UMBRELLA THE MACHINE IS THUS KEPT EXPANDED DURING DESCENT THE CAR IS FASTENED TO THE CENTRE CORD
2587-160609-0005 THAT IT MAY BE READILY AND QUICKLY DETACHED EITHER BY CUTTING A STRING OR PULLING A TRIGGER CONSEQUENTLY IN THE EAST WHERE THE UMBRELLA HAS BEEN FROM THE EARLIEST AGES IN FAMILIAR USE
2587-160609-0006 TO ENABLE THEM TO JUMP SAFELY FROM GREAT HEIGHTS FATHER LOUBERE IN HIS CURIOUS ACCOUNT OF SIAM RELATES THAT A PERSON FAMOUS IN THAT COUNTRY FOR HIS DEXTERITY USED TO DIVERT THE KING AND COURT BY THE EXTRAORDINARY LEAPS HE TOOK
2587-160609-0007 HAVING TWO UMBRELLAS WITH LONG SLENDER HANDLES FASTENED TO HIS GIRDLE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2587-160609-0008 HIS IDEA WAS THAT IT MIGHT BE MADE A SORT OF FIRE ESCAPE
2587-160609-0009 TO ACT AS A SAFETY GUARD TO THE AERONAUT IN CASE OF ANY ACCIDENT DURING AN EXCURSION HE MADE FROM LILLE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHEN HE TRAVERSED WITHOUT STOPPING A DISTANCE OF THREE HUNDRED MILES HE LET DOWN A PARACHUTE WITH A BASKET FASTENED TO IT
2587-160609-0010 CONTAINING A DOG THIS HE SUFFERED TO FALL FROM A GREAT HEIGHT AND IT REACHED THE GROUND IN SAFETY THE FIRST PARACHUTE DESCENT FROM A BALLOON HOWEVER WAS MADE BY JACQUES GARNERIN
2587-160609-0011 IN THE PARK OF MONCEAU DE LA LANDE THE CELEBRATED ASTRONOMER HAS FURNISHED A DETAILED AND HIGHLY INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THIS FOOLISH EXPERIMENT GARNERIN RESIDED IN LONDON
2587-160609-0012 DURING THE SHORT PEACE OF EIGHTEEN O TWO AND MADE TWO ASCENTS WITH HIS BALLOON IN THE SECOND OF WHICH HE LET HIMSELF FALL AT AN AMAZING HEIGHT WITH A PARACHUTE OF TWENTY THREE FEET DIAMETER HE STARTED FROM AN ENCLOSURE
2587-160609-0013 AND DESCENDED AFTER HAVING BEEN SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES IN THE AIR AFTER CUTTING HIMSELF AWAY HE FLOATED OVER MARYLEBONE AND SOMERS TOWN AND FELL IN A FIELD NEAR SAINT PANCRAS OLD CHURCH THE OSCILLATION WAS SO GREAT
2587-160609-0014 AND NARROWLY ESCAPED DEATH HE SEEMED A GOOD DEAL FRIGHTENED AND SAID THAT THE PERIL WAS TOO GREAT FOR ENDURANCE ONE OF THE STAYS OF THE MACHINE HAVING GIVEN WAY HIS DANGER WAS INCREASED
2587-160609-0015 THE NEXT PERSON WHO TRIED THIS DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT WAS HIS NIECE ELIZA GARNERIN WHO DESCENDED SEVERAL TIMES IN SAFETY HER PARACHUTE HAD A LARGE ORIFICE IN THE TOP IN ORDER TO CHECK THE OSCILLATION
2587-160609-0016 THE NEXT EXPERIMENTALIST WAS A PERSON OF THE NAME OF COCKING WHO ENDED HIS DAYS IN A MANNER UNWORTHY HIS TALENTS THROUGH A SERIES OF LAMENTABLE MISTAKES HIS PARACHUTE WAS CONSTRUCTED ON THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE OF A WEDGE LIKE FORM
2587-160609-0017 AND WAS INTENDED TO CLEAVE THROUGH THE AIR INSTEAD OF OFFERING A RESISTANCE TO IT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PROVED THAT THE PRINCIPLE WAS WRONG BUT THE DEFECT LAY IN THE WEAKNESS OF THE MATERIALS EMPLOYED IN THE FORMATION OF THE PARACHUTE
2587-160609-0018 ON THE TWENTY NINTH JULY EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN MISTER COCKING ASCENDED IN HIS NEW PARACHUTE ATTACHED TO THE GREAT NASSAU BALLOON MISTER COCKING LIBERATED HIMSELF FROM THE BALLOON THE PARACHUTE COLLAPSED AND FELL AT A FRIGHTFUL RATE
2587-160609-0019 INTO A FIELD NEAR LEA WHERE POOR COCKING WAS FOUND WITH AN AWFUL WOUND ON HIS RIGHT TEMPLE HE NEVER SPOKE BUT DIED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS IT IS MUCH TO BE REGRETTED THAT THE DESCENT WAS EVER ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE
2587-160609-0020 THE AERONAUTS THEMSELVES WERE FOR SOME TIME IN A STATE OF IMMINENT PERIL IMMEDIATELY THE PARACHUTE WAS CUT AWAY THE BALLOON ASCENDED WITH FRIGHTFUL VELOCITY OWING TO THE ASCENDING POWER IT NECESSARILY GAINED BY BEING FREED FROM A WEIGHT OF NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
2587-160609-0021 AND HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT ITS OCCUPANTS APPLIED THEIR MOUTHS TO THE AIR BAGS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SUFFOCATED BY THE ESCAPING GAS WHEN THE RE ACTION TOOK PLACE THE BALLOON HAD LOST ITS BUOYANCY AND FELL RATHER THAN DESCENDED TO THE GROUND
2587-160609-0022 AND MADE THREE DESCENTS IN A PARACHUTE IN SUCCESSION WITHOUT INJURY UNDETERRED BY THE AWFUL FATE OF HIS PREDECESSOR THIS GENTLEMAN DETERMINED ON MAKING A PARACHUTE DESCENT WHICH SHOULD PROVE THE CORRECTNESS OF THE THEORY
2587-160609-0023 AND THE MONTPELLIER GARDENS AT CHELTENHAM WERE SELECTED AS THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOIT
2587-160609-0024 FOR PERMITTING DOCKING'S ASCENT THE OWNERS OF THE GARDENS AT CHELTENHAM WOULD NOT SUFFER THE EXPERIMENT TO BE MADE
2587-160609-0025 AS HE WAS PERMITTED TO DISPLAY HIS PARACHUTE IN THE MANNER HE INTENDED TO USE IT THE IDEA SUDDENLY FLASHED ACROSS HIS MIND THAT HE COULD CARRY OUT HIS LONG NURSED WISHES HE SUDDENLY CUT THE ROPE WHICH KEPT HIM DOWN AND WENT OFF
2587-160609-0026 TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE SPECTATORS THE LAST CHEERING SOUND THAT REACHED HIM BEING HE WILL BE KILLED TO A DEAD CERTAINTY AFTER ATTAINING AN ALTITUDE OF NEARLY TWO MILES MISTER HAMPTON PROCEEDED TO CUT THE ROPE THAT HELD HIM ATTACHED TO THE BALLOON
2587-160609-0027 AS HE REMEMBERED THAT IT WOULD SOON BE LIFE OR DEATH WITH HIM BUT AT LENGTH DREW HIS KNIFE ACROSS THE ROPE THE FIRST FEELINGS HE EXPERIENCED WERE BOTH UNPLEASANT AND ALARMING HIS EYES AND THE TOP OF HIS HEAD APPEARED TO BE FORCED UPWARDS
2587-160609-0028 BUT THIS PASSED OFF IN A FEW SECONDS AND HIS FEELINGS SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME PLEASANT RATHER THAN DISAGREEABLE
2587-160609-0029 MISTER HAMPTON REMEMBERED THAT A BAG OF BALLAST WAS FASTENED BENEATH THE CAR HE STOOPED OVER AND UPSET THE SAND HE ALSO NOTED BY HIS WATCH THE TIME HE OCCUPIED IN DESCENDING THE EARTH SEEMED COMING UP TO HIM RAPIDLY
2587-160609-0030 THE PARACHUTE INDICATED ITS APPROACH TO TERRA FIRMA BY A SLIGHT OSCILLATION AND HE PRESENTLY STRUCK THE GROUND IN THE CENTRE OF A FIELD WHERE HE WAS FIRST WELCOMED BY A SHEEP WHICH STARED AT THIS VISITOR FROM THE CLOUDS IN UTTER AMAZEMENT
2587-160609-0031 MISTER HAMPTON REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT TWICE IN LONDON THOUGH ON BOTH OCCASIONS WITH CONSIDERABLE DANGER TO HIMSELF THE FIRST TIME FALLING ON A TREE IN KENSINGTON GARDENS THE SECOND ON A HOUSE WHICH THREW HIM OUT OF THE BASKET
2587-160609-0032 AFTER THIS EXPERIMENT THERE WAS A LULL IN THE PARACHUTE FOLLY UNTIL SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO
2587-160609-0033 BY HER PERILOUS ESCAPES BOTH IN LIFE AND LIMB
