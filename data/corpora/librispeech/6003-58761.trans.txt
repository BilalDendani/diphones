6003-58761-0000 THERE ARE VERY MANY INSTANCES HOWEVER WHERE THE CAUSE CAN BE TRACED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY MANY OF THESE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED AND THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT MIGHT BE OF COURSE AS HAS BEEN OFTEN STATED THERE IS ONLY ONE REMOTE CAUSE FOR ALL WINDS AND THAT IS THE SUN
6003-58761-0001 COUPLED WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN LOCAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE CONTINUALLY MODIFYING THE PHENOMENA OF AIR MOVEMENT THE VELOCITY OF WINDS AS THEY OCCUR FROM DAY TO DAY
6003-58761-0002 VARIES VERY GREATLY WITH THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH ORDINARILY THE VELOCITY AT ONE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE EARTH WILL BE MORE THAN THREE TIMES GREATER THAN IT IS AT FIFTY OR SIXTY FEET ABOVE
6003-58761-0003 AND EVEN AT SIXTY FEET THE VELOCITY IS MUCH GREATER THAN AT THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
6003-58761-0004 THIS IS DUE PARTLY TO THE RETARDING EFFECT OF FRICTION CAUSED BY CONTACT OF THE AIR WITH THE EARTH'S SURFACE BUT MORE PARTICULARLY BY TREES INEQUALITY OF SURFACE
6003-58761-0005 AND OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS ON THE EARTH THERE IS A VARIETY OF WIND CALLED MOUNTAIN WINDS THAT ARISE FROM DIFFERENT CAUSES AS HAS BEEN STATED IN A FORMER CHAPTER
6003-58761-0006 AND THE DENSITY IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING FROM DENSER TO RARER THE HIGHER WE ASCEND SUPPOSE AT A CERTAIN POINT SAY HALFWAY UP A MOUNTAIN SIDE THE AIR HAS A CERTAIN DENSITY AND IF IT IS AT REST
6003-58761-0007 SUPPOSE WE START AT A GIVEN POINT ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN AND RUN OUT ON A LEVEL TILL WE ARE ONE HUNDRED FEET IN A PERPENDICULAR LINE ABOVE THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN THE AIR CONTAINED WITHIN THOSE LINES WILL BE IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE
6003-58761-0008 IF NOW THE SUN SHINES UPON THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN THE AIR IS WARMED AND EXPANDS ACCORDING TO A WELL KNOWN LAW AND THE AMOUNT OF EXPANSION WILL DEPEND UPON THE DEPTH OF THE VOLUME OF AIR HENCE THE POINT OF GREATEST EXPANSION IN OUR
6003-58761-0009 FIGURE WILL BE WHERE THE AIR IS ONE HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE AS WE GO TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN TILL WE COME TO THE POINT WHERE OUR HORIZONTAL LINE MAKES CONTACT WITH THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
6003-58761-0010 AT THAT POINT OF COURSE THERE IS NO EXPANSION BECAUSE THERE IS NO DEPTH OF AIR AND THE EFFECT WILL BE THAT THE EXPANDED AIR WILL OVERFLOW TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN AND BE DEFLECTED UP ITS SLOPING SIDE
6003-58761-0011 AS NIGHT COMES ON THIS UPWARD MOVEMENT WILL CEASE AND THERE WILL BE A SEASON OF QUIET UNTIL THE EARTH HAS BECOME COLDER THAN THE AIR AND WE HAVE A PHENOMENON OF EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE KIND WHEN THE AIR CONTRACTS INSTEAD OF EXPANDS
6003-58761-0012 WHICH PRODUCES A DOWNWARD CURRENT FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOP
6003-58761-0013 SUCH AS DURING THE PREVALENCE OF A STORM IN SOME OF THE REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA HOTTEST DURING THE DAY TIME THE NIGHTS ARE MADE ENDURABLE AND EVEN DELIGHTFUL
6003-58761-0014 IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT ON THE SHADY SIDE OF A HIGH AND STEEP MOUNTAIN WHERE THE SUN'S RAYS STRIKE IT SO OBLIQUELY IF AT ALL THAT THE EARTH WILL BE BUT LITTLE HEATED THERE WILL BE A VAST MASS OF COLD AIR STORED UP
6003-58761-0015 AFTER THE VALLEY HAS BECOME INTENSELY HEATED BY THE SUN THERE IS AN ASCENDING CURRENT OF AIR WHICH IN TURN CAUSES A DOWN RUSH OF THE COLD BODY OF AIR
6003-58761-0016 FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THESE LOCAL WINDS ARE FREQUENTLY VERY SEVERE ONLY LASTING HOWEVER FOR A SHORT TIME UNTIL AN EQUILIBRIUM OF TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
6003-58761-0017 A WONDERFUL EXHIBITION OF THIS SORT OF WIND IS SAID TO OCCUR AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR ON THE COAST AT TIERRA DEL FUEGO WHERE A BLAST WHICH THEY CALL THE WILLIWAUS COMES DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIDE WITHOUT WARNING
6003-58761-0018 WITH SUCH TREMENDOUS FORCE THAT NO SHIP COULD STAND THE STRAIN
6003-58761-0019 IF IT SHOULD CONTINUE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME FORTUNATELY THE SHOCK DOES NOT LAST MORE THAN EIGHT OR TEN SECONDS WHEN IT IS FOLLOWED BY A PERFECT CALM IT IS AS THOUGH A GREAT VOLUME OF AIR HAD BEEN FIRED FROM SOME ENORMOUS CANNON FROM THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN TO THE SEA
6003-58761-0020 THE WATER IS PULVERIZED INTO A SPRAY THAT IS DRIVEN IN EVERY DIRECTION SOMETIMES THESE VIOLENT BLASTS OCCUR IN THE ALPS BUT FROM A VERY DIFFERENT CAUSE
6003-58761-0021 AVALANCHES OF GREAT EXTENT OFTEN TAKE PLACE ON THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAINS WHEN A VAST AMOUNT OF MATERIAL EQUAL TO THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION CUBIC FEET OF EARTH WILL FALL SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET
6003-58761-0022 OFTEN AN AVALANCHE OF THIS KIND WILL PRODUCE A WIND WHICH IS CONFINED OF COURSE TO A RESTRICTED AREA THAT IS SAID TO BE SO VIOLENT AS TO TEAR ONE'S CLOTHES INTO SHREDS THIS IS NOT CAUSED BY ANY DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE
6003-58761-0023 BUT BY A VIOLENT COMPRESSION THERE IS A PECULIAR WIND THAT OCCURS IN SWITZERLAND OFTEN BETWEEN THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND MARCH THESE WINDS LAST FROM TWO TO THREE DAYS AND ARE OF GREAT VIOLENCE ESPECIALLY NEAR THE MOUNTAINS
6003-58761-0024 THEY ARE WARM AND DRY AND ARE CAUSED BY AN AREA OF LOW BAROMETER AND AN ASCENDING CURRENT OF AIR OCCURRING AT SOME POINT NORTH OF THE ALPS
6003-58761-0025 WHICH CAUSES THE AIR FROM ITALY TO FLOW OVER THE ALPINE RANGE CAUSING A TREMENDOUS PRECIPITATION OF SNOW AND RAIN WHICH NOT ONLY TAKES THE MOISTURE FROM THE AIR
6003-58761-0026 BUT SETS FREE IN THE FORM OF HEAT THE ENERGY THAT WAS STORED IN THE PROCESS OF EVAPORATION AND THIS TOGETHER WITH THE COMPRESSION OF THE AIR AS IT FLOWS DOWN THE SLOPE OF THE MOUNTAINS MAKES IT HOT AND DRY THIS WIND IS CALLED THE FOHN
6003-58761-0027 WYOMING MONTANA ALSO EXTENDING UP INTO BRITISH AMERICA THIS WIND WHICH IS HERE CALLED CHINOOK
6003-58761-0028 WHICH IS EXCEEDINGLY COLD AND LASTS SOMETIMES FOR A PERIOD OF ONE HUNDRED HOURS THE TEMPERATURE FALLS AT TIMES THIRTY OR FORTY DEGREES BELOW ZERO AND THE WIND MAINTAINS A VELOCITY OF FROM FORTY TO FIFTY MILES AN HOUR
6003-58761-0029 THESE WINDS SPREAD EASTWARD AS FAR AS ILLINOIS BUT NOT WITH THE SAME SEVERITY AND THEY MOVE SOUTHWARD TO THE GULF OF MEXICO SPREADING OVER THE STATES OF TEXAS AND LOUISIANA AND ARE THERE CALLED NORTHERS
6003-58761-0030 AND THE COLD ITS LOWEST TEMPERATURE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE WIND IS ACCOMPANIED AS IT FREQUENTLY IS BY SEVERE SNOWING BY THE TIME IT REACHES THE GULF STATES IT IS VERY MUCH MODIFIED AS TO TEMPERATURE BUT IT IS A VERY DISAGREEABLE WIND IN THAT
6003-58761-0031 PORTION OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE EXCEEDING DAMPNESS OF THE AIR ONE WOULD BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IN DRY STILL AIR EVEN IF IT WERE MANY DEGREES BELOW ZERO THAN IN AN AIR FREIGHTED WITH MOISTURE ALTHOUGH THE TEMPERATURE HAS NOT FALLEN
6003-58761-0032 TO THE FREEZING POINT THERE ARE HOT WINDS CALLED BY DIFFERENT NAMES ACCORDING TO THE LOCALITIES IN WHICH THEY OCCUR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR THE INHABITANTS ARE AFFLICTED WITH WHAT THEY CALL A DESERT WIND
6003-58761-0033 THAT BLOWS FROM THE HEATED REGIONS OF ARIZONA TOWARD THE PACIFIC OCEAN THE TEMPERATURE SOMETIMES REACHES ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
6003-58761-0034 AND PERSONS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO PERISH FROM THE EFFECTS OF THESE HOT WINDS IN OPEN BOATS OUT ON THE WATER BEFORE THEY COULD REACH LAND HOT WINDS PREVAIL ON THE PLAINS OF KANSAS DURING THE MONTHS OF JULY AND AUGUST THAT ARE PHENOMENAL IN THEIR INTENSITY
6003-58761-0035 SO MUCH SO THAT IF THEY WERE WIDESPREAD AND OF LONG CONTINUANCE LIKE THE NORTHERN BLIZZARD THEY WOULD BE ATTENDED WITH GREAT LOSS OF LIFE AND DESTRUCTION TO VEGETATION
6003-58761-0036 FORTUNATELY THEY COME IN NARROW STREAKS AND IN MOST CASES DO NOT BLOW MORE THAN FROM TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES AT A TIME THESE HOT BELTS ARE SOMETIMES NOT OVER ONE HUNDRED FEET WIDE AND AGAIN THEY ARE AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED
6003-58761-0037 THEY ARE SO HOT AND DRY THAT GREEN LEAVES AND GRASS ARE RENDERED AS DRY AS POWDER IN A FEW MINUTES THESE WINDS ARE PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR WHEN THE PREVAILING WIND IS SOUTHWESTERLY
6003-58761-0038 THE AIR BECOMES HEATED TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND ARE THE RESULTING EFFECT OF CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF AIR CURRENTS IN THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THAT FORCE THE ALREADY HEATED AIR TOWARD THE EARTH
6003-58761-0039 AS THE AIR DESCENDS IT IS MORE AND MORE COMPRESSED WHICH CAUSES IT TO BECOME MORE AND MORE HEATED
6003-58761-0040 AS SHOWN BY THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE FIRE SYRINGE IT WAS SHOWN THAT AIR AT NORMAL TEMPERATURE COULD BE SUDDENLY COMPRESSED INTO SO SMALL A SPACE THAT THE CONDENSED HEAT WHICH WAS BEFORE DIFFUSED THROUGH THE WHOLE BULK OF AIR AT NORMAL PRESSURE
6003-58761-0041 WAS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE IGNITION A CUBIC YARD OF AIR ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WOULD OCCUPY A MUCH LARGER SPACE IF CARRIED A MILE ABOVE IT FROM THIS IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT IF A VOLUME OF AIR AT THAT HEIGHT HAD A TEMPERATURE OF SEVENTY OR EIGHTY DEGREES
6003-58761-0042 BECAUSE IT IS NATURAL FOR HEATED AIR TO RISE AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE POWER THAT FORCED IT DOWN TO THE EARTH
6003-58761-0043 REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE IN A FORMER CHAPTER TO TORNADO WINDS THEY ARE RATHER EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENA AND NOT THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD
6003-58761-0044 THE ONWARD MOVEMENT OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS ABOUT THIRTY MILES PER HOUR TORNADOES OCCUR WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IN THE UNITED STATES THAN IN ANY OTHER SECTION OF THE GLOBE TORNADOES SELDOM OCCUR IN WINTER
6003-58761-0045 ALTHOUGH THEY OCCUR SOMETIMES IN APRIL JUNE AND JULY
6003-58761-0046 INVOLVING GREAT LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY WHEN A TORNADO MOVES OFF THE LAND ON TO THE OCEAN IT MAY BECOME WHAT IS TERMED A WATERSPOUT THESE PROBABLY NEVER ORIGINATE ON THE WATER
6003-58761-0047 BUT AFTER THEY HAVE ONCE FORMED MAY BE CARRIED OVER THE WATER TO A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE A TORNADO WAS NEVER KNOWN TO ORIGINATE ON THE SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN BUT THERE ARE A FEW INSTANCES THE MOST NOTABLE ONE BEING THE RACINE TORNADO
