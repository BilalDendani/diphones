6139-58869-0000 A MAN RIDING OVER FROM THE NEAREST TOWN TWICE A WEEK BROUGHT THE MAIL BAG ON HORSEBACK SO FEW LETTERS FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THIS PARTICULAR BAG THAT SQUIRE JAYNES WHO KEPT THE STORE AND POST OFFICE
6139-58869-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE STORE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT AN OVERGROWN BOY WHO HAD STOPPED TO GET HIS FATHER'S WEEKLY PAPER HE SAT ON THE COUNTER DANGLING HIS BIG BARE FEET AGAINST A NAIL KEG AND CATCHING FLIES IN HIS SUNBURNED HANDS
6139-58869-0002 WHILE HE WAITED FOR THE MAIL TO BE OPENED THE SQUIRE PEERED INQUIRINGLY AT HIM OVER THE SQUARE BOWED SPECTACLES JAKE HE ASKED EVER HEAR TELL OF A MISS ELIZABETH LLOYD LEWIS UP THIS WAY

6139-58869-0007 I'M GLAD THERE'S SOMEBODY TAKES ENOUGH INTEREST IN THE CHILD TO WRITE TO HER CONTINUED THE GOSSIPY OLD SQUIRE WHO OFTEN TALKED TO HIMSELF WHEN HE COULD FIND NO OTHER AUDIENCE I WONDER WHO IT IS LLOYDSBORO VALLEY IT'S POSTMARKED

6139-58869-0009 ANSWERED THE OLD MAN GIVING A FINAL CLOSE SCRUTINY BEFORE HANDING IT TO THE BOY IT MIGHT LIE HERE ALL WEEK IN CASE NONE OF THEM HAPPENED TO COME TO THE STORE AND IT LOOKS AS IF IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT
6139-58869-0010 AND HE TOOK HIS TIME IN GOING WELL FOR LITTLE BETTY THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WONDERFUL SURPRISE WAS ON ITS WAY TO HER OR SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE FOR THE LETTER TO ARRIVE IT HAD BEEN A TIRESOME DAY FOR THE CHILD
6139-58869-0011 UP BEFORE FIVE IN HER BARE LITTLE ROOM IN THE WEST GABLE BUSY WITH MORNING CHORES UNTIL BREAKFAST WAS READY SHE HAD EARNED A REST LONG BEFORE THE LITTLE COLONEL'S DAY HAD BEGUN AFTERWARD SHE HAD HELPED WITH THE BREAKFAST DISHES
6139-58869-0012 WITH THE WATER TRICKLING OUT IN A CEASELESS DRIP DRIP ON THE COLD STONES SHE DABBLED HER FINGERS IN THE SPRING FOR A LONG TIME WHEN THE CHURNING WAS DONE WISHING SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT SIT THERE AND LISTEN TO THE SECRETS IT WAS TRYING TO TELL
6139-58869-0013 SURELY IT MUST HAVE LEARNED A GREAT MANY ON ITS UNDERGROUND WAY AMONG THE ROOTS OF THINGS AND ALL ELSE THAT LIES HIDDEN IN THE EARTH BUT SHE COULD NOT LOITER LONG THERE WAS THE DINNER TABLE TO SET FOR THE HUNGRY FARM HANDS
6139-58869-0014 AND AFTER THE DINNER WAS OVER MORE DISHES TO WASH THEN THERE WERE SOME TOWELS TO IRON IT WAS TWO O'CLOCK BEFORE HER WORK WAS ALL DONE AND SHE HAD TIME TO GO UP TO HER LITTLE ROOM IN THE WEST GABLE
6139-58869-0015 THE SUN POURED IN THROUGH THE SHUTTERLESS WINDOWS SO FIERCELY THAT SHE DID NOT STAY LONG ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO PUT ON A CLEAN APRON AND BRUSH HER CURLY HAIR AS SHE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE LOOKING GLASS
6139-58869-0016 IT WAS SUCH A TINY MIRROR THAT SHE COULD SEE ONLY A PART OF HER FACE AT A TIME WHEN HER BIG BROWN EYES WISTFUL AND QUESTIONING AS A FAWN'S WERE REFLECTED IN IT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR THE SENSITIVE LITTLE MOUTH
6139-58869-0017 OR IF SHE STOOD ON TIPTOE SO THAT SHE COULD SEE HER PLUMP ROUND CHIN DIMPLED CHEEKS AND WHITE TEETH THE EYES WERE LEFT OUT AND SHE COULD SEE NO MORE OF HER INQUISITIVE LITTLE NOSE THAN LAY BELOW THE BIG FRECKLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
6139-58869-0018 HASTILY TYING BACK HER CURLS WITH A BOW OF BROWN RIBBON SHE SLIPPED ON HER APRON AND RAN DOWN STAIRS BUTTONING IT AS SHE WENT SHE WAS FREE NOW TO DO AS SHE PLEASED UNTIL SUPPER TIME ONCE OUT OF THE HOUSE
6139-58869-0019 SHE WALKED SLOWLY ALONG THROUGH THE SHADY ORCHARD SWINGING HER SUNBONNET BY THE STRINGS AFTER THE ORCHARD CAME THE LONG LEAFY LANE WITH ITS DOUBLE ROWS OF CHERRY TREES AND THEN THE GATE AT THE END
6139-58869-0020 LEADING INTO THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY AS SHE SLIPPED HER HAND AROUND THE POST TO UNFASTEN THE CHAIN THAT HELD THE GATE LITTLE BARE FEET CAME PATTERING BEHIND HER
6139-58869-0021 BETTY'S LITTLE LAMB THEY CALLED HIM AND BETTY'S SHADOW AND BETTY'S STICKING PLASTER BECAUSE EVERYWHERE SHE WENT THERE WAS DAVY JUST AT HER HEELS ALL THE APPLETON CHILDREN WERE BOYS THREE YOUNGER AND TWO OLDER THAN DAVY
6139-58869-0022 WHOSE LAST BIRTHDAY CAKE SHOULD HAVE HAD EIGHT CANDLES IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY CELEBRATION OF THE EVENT BUT THERE NEVER HAD BEEN A BIRTHDAY CAKE WITH CANDLES ON IT ON THE APPLETON TABLE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A FOOLISH WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
6139-58869-0023 AND BIRTHDAYS CAME AND WENT SOMETIMES WITHOUT THE CHILDREN KNOWING THAT THEY HAD PASSED DAVY WAS A QUEER LITTLE FELLOW HE TAGGED ALONG AFTER BETTY SWITCHING AT THE GRASS WITH A WHIP HE CARRIED
6139-58869-0024 AS HE CAUGHT UP WITH HER AT THE GATE HE DID NOT EVEN ASK WHERE SHE WAS GOING KNOWING THAT HE WOULD FIND OUT IN DUE TIME IF HE ONLY FOLLOWED FAR ENOUGH HE DID NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW FAR TO DAY
6139-58869-0025 BETTY LED THE WAY ACROSS THE ROAD TO A PLAIN LITTLE WOODEN CHURCH SET BACK IN A GROVE OF CEDAR TREES BEHIND THE CHURCH WAS A GRAVEYARD WHERE THEY OFTEN STROLLED ON SUMMER AFTERNOONS THROUGH THE TANGLE OF GRASS AND WEEDS AND MYRTLE VINES
6139-58869-0026 A LITTLE RED BOOKCASE INSIDE THE CHURCH WAS THE ATTRACTION BETTY HAD ONLY LATELY DISCOVERED IT ALTHOUGH IT HAD STOOD FOR YEARS ON A BACK BENCH IN A COBWEBBY CORNER IT HELD ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF A SCATTERED SUNDAY SCHOOL LIBRARY
6139-58869-0027 THAT HAD BEEN IN USE TWO GENERATIONS BEFORE QUEER LITTLE BOOKS THEY WERE TIME YELLOWED AND MUSTY SMELLING BUT TO STORY LOVING LITTLE BETTY HUNGRY FOR SOMETHING NEW THEY SEEMED A VERITABLE GOLD MINE SHE HAD
6139-58869-0028 FOUND THAT NO KEY BARRED HER WAY INTO THIS LITTLE RED TREASURE HOUSE OF A BOOKCASE AND A BOARD PROPPED AGAINST THE WALL UNDER THE WINDOW OUTSIDE GAVE HER AN EASY ENTRANCE INTO THE CHURCH
6139-58869-0029 HERE SHE CAME DAY AFTER DAY WHEN HER WORK WAS DONE TO PORE OVER THE MUSTY OLD VOLUMES OF TALES FORGOTTEN LONG AGO IN BETTY'S LITTLE ROOM UNDER THE ROOF AT HOME WAS A PILE OF HANDSOMELY BOUND BOOKS
6139-58869-0030 LYING ON A CHEST BESIDE HER MOTHER'S BIBLE THEY WERE TWELVE IN ALL AND HAD COME IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT CHRISTMAS BOXES AND EACH ONE HAD BETTY'S NAME ON THE FLY LEAF WITH THE DATE OF THE CHRISTMAS ON WHICH IT HAPPENED TO BE SENT
6139-58869-0031 UNDERNEATH WAS ALWAYS WRITTEN FROM YOUR LOVING GODMOTHER ELIZABETH LLOYD SHERMAN EXCEPTING A FEW SCHOOL BOOKS AND SOME OUT OF DATE CENSUS REPORTS THEY WERE THE ONLY BOOKS IN THE APPLETON HOUSE
6139-58869-0032 BETTY GUARDED THEM LIKE A LITTLE DRAGON THEY WERE THE ONLY THINGS SHE OWNED THAT THE CHILDREN WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH EVEN DAVY WHEN HE WAS PERMITTED TO LOOK AT THE WONDERFUL PICTURES IN HER ARABIAN NIGHTS OR PILGRIM'S PROGRESS
6139-58869-0033 AND TWO VOLUMES OF FAIRY TALES IN GREEN AND GOLD WITH A GORGEOUS PEACOCK ON THE COVER EUGENE FIELD'S POEMS HAD COME IN THE LAST BOX WITH RILEY'S SONGS OF CHILDHOOD AND KIPLING'S JUNGLE TALES TWELVE BEAUTIFUL BOOKS
6139-58869-0034 ALL OF MISSUS SHERMAN'S GIVING AND THEY WERE LIKE TWELVE GREAT WINDOWS TO BETTY OPENING INTO A NEW STRANGE WORLD FAR AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF HER EVERY DAY LIFE
6139-58869-0035 SHE HAD READ THEM OVER AND OVER SO MANY TIMES THAT SHE ALWAYS KNEW WHAT WAS COMING NEXT EVEN BEFORE SHE TURNED THE PAGE AND SHE HAD READ THEM TO THE OTHER CHILDREN SO MANY TIMES THAT THEY TOO KNEW THEM ALMOST BY HEART
6139-58869-0036 THE LITTLE DOG EARED BOOKS IN THE MEETING HOUSE PROVED POOR READING SOMETIMES AFTER SUCH ENTERTAINMENT SO MANY OF THEM WERE ABOUT UNNATURALLY GOOD CHILDREN WHO NEVER DID WRONG AND UNNATURALLY BAD CHILDREN WHO NEVER DID RIGHT
6139-58869-0037 AT THE END THERE WAS ALWAYS THE WORD MORAL IN BIG CAPITAL LETTERS AS IF THE READERS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TOO BLIND TO FIND IT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT HAD TO BE PUT DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PATH FOR THEM TO STUMBLE OVER
6139-58869-0038 BETTY LAUGHED AT THEM SOMETIMES BUT SHE TOUCHED THE LITTLE BOOKS WITH REVERENT FINGERS WHEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW OLD THEY WERE AND HOW LONG AGO THEIR FIRST CHILDISH READERS LAID THEM ASIDE
6139-58869-0039 THE HANDS THAT HAD HELD THEM FIRST HAD YEARS BEFORE GROWN TIRED AND WRINKLED AND OLD AND HAD BEEN LYING FOR A GENERATION UNDER THE MYRTLE AND LILIES OF THE CHURCHYARD OUTSIDE
6139-58869-0040 MANY AN AFTERNOON SHE HAD SPENT PERCHED IN THE HIGH WINDOW WITH HER FEET DRAWN UP UNDER HER ON THE SILL READING ALOUD TO DAVY WHO LAY OUTSIDE ON THE GRASS STARING UP AT THE SKY
6139-58869-0041 DAVY'S MIND LIKE HIS LEGS COULD NOT CLIMB AS FAR AS BETTY'S AND SHE USUALLY HAD TO STOP AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERY PAGE TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING OFTEN HE FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST INTERESTING PART
6139-58869-0042 AND THEN BETTY READ ON TO HERSELF WITH NOTHING TO BREAK THE STILLNESS AROUND HER BUT THE BUZZING OF THE WASPS AS THEY DARTED ANGRILY IN AND OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW ABOVE HER HEAD TO DAY BETTY HAD READ NEARLY AN HOUR
6139-58869-0043 AND DAVY'S EYELIDS WERE BEGINNING TO FLUTTER DROWSILY WHEN THEY HEARD THE SLOW THUD OF A HORSE'S HOOFS IN THE THICK DUST OF THE ROAD BETTY STOPPED READING TO LISTEN
6139-58869-0044 AND TWO BROWN HANDS WERE HELD UP TO RECEIVE THE LETTER BUT JAKE PREFERRED TO DELIVER THE IMPORTANT DOCUMENT HIMSELF HERE YOU ARE HE SAID RIDING ALONGSIDE THE WINDOW AND DROPPING THE LETTER INTO HER EAGER HANDS
6139-58869-0045 IF JAKE EXPECTED HER TO TEAR IT OPEN INSTANTLY AND SHARE THE NEWS WITH HIM BEFORE SHE HAD EXAMINED EVERY INCH OF THE BIG SQUARE ENVELOPE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED
6139-58869-0046 THEN SHE SPREAD THE LETTER OUT ON HER KNEES DRAWING A LONG BREATH OF PLEASURE AS THE FAINTEST ODOUR OF VIOLETS FLOATED UP FROM THE PAPER WITH ITS DAINTY MONOGRAM AT THE TOP DAVY WAITED IN SILENCE
6139-58869-0047 WATCHING A FLUSH SPREAD OVER BETTY'S FACE AS SHE READ HER BREATH CAME SHORT AND HER HEART BEAT FAST OH DAVY SHE EXCLAIMED IN A LOW WONDERING TONE WHAT DO YOU THINK
6139-58869-0048 IT IS AN INVITATION TO A HOUSE PARTY AT LOCUST LLOYD SHERMAN'S HOUSE PARTY OH IT'S LIKE A LOVELY LOVELY FAIRY TALE WITH ME FOR THE PRINCESS I'VE NEVER TRAVELLED ON THE CARS SINCE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER IT
6139-58869-0049 I'VE NEVER HAD ANY GIRLS TO PLAY WITH IN ALL MY LIFE AND NOW THERE WILL BE TWO BESIDES LLOYD AND OH DAVY BEST OF ALL I'LL SEE MY BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL GODMOTHER I SHALL BE THERE A WHOLE MONTH
6139-58869-0050 AND SHE KNEW MY MAMMA AND WAS HER DEAREST FRIEND I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE I WAS A BABY WHEN SHE CAME TO MY CHRISTENING
6139-58869-0051 DAVY LISTENED TO HER RAPTURES WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING FOR AWHILE
6139-58869-0052 THERE'S A TEAR RUNNING DOWN THE SIDE OF YOUR NOSE IS THERE ASKED BETTY BRUSHING IT AWAY WITH THE BACK OF HER HAND
6139-58869-0053 A GODMOTHER MUST BE THE NEXT BEST THING TO A REAL MOTHER YOU SEE DAVY BECAUSE IT'S A MOTHER THAT GOD GIVES YOU TO TAKE THE PLACE OF YOUR OWN WHEN SHE IS GONE
6139-58869-0054 THEN SHE WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THE NARROW AISLE OF THE LITTLE MEETING HOUSE BETWEEN ITS DOUBLE ROWS OF NARROW STRAIGHT BACKED PEWS AS SHE REACHED THE BENCH LIKE ALTAR EXTENDING IN FRONT OF THE PULPIT SHE SLIPPED TO HER KNEES A MOMENT
6139-58869-0055 HER SUNBONNET HAD FALLEN BACK FROM HER TOUSLED CURLS AND THE LATE AFTERNOON SUN STREAMED ACROSS HER SHINING LITTLE FACE THANK YOU GOD
6139-58869-0056 CAME IN A HAPPY WHISPER FROM THE DEPTHS OF A GLAD LITTLE HEART IT'S THE NICEST SURPRISE YOU EVER SENT ME AND I'M SO MUCH OBLIGED THEN BETTY STOOD UP AND PUT ON HER SUNBONNET
6139-58869-0057 DOWN THE LANE THEY WENT BETWEEN THE ROWS OF CHERRY TREES ACROSS THE ORCHARD AND UP THE PATH SOMEHOW THE WORLD HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEMED HALF SO BEAUTIFUL TO BETTY AS IT DID NOW
