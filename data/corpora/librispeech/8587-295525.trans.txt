8587-295525-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE SMOKE RUNNING FOX IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE LEAD AND TURNED TOWARD THE NORTH HE BELIEVED THAT THE SHAWNEES WOULD HESITATE TO FOLLOW THEM FAR IN THAT DIRECTION FOR FEAR OF BEING LED INTO AN AMBUSH
8587-295525-0001 IT WAS NOT LONG HOWEVER BEFORE THEY HEARD SIGNALS RINGING THROUGH THE NIGHT A SHORT DISTANCE BEHIND THEM THE SHAWNEES ARE CLOSE WE MUST TRAVEL FASTER SAID RUNNING FOX DAWN WAS BREAKING WHEN THEY REACHED THE END OF THE LAKE
8587-295525-0002 HAVING HEARD NOTHING FURTHER FROM THEIR PURSUERS THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD TURNED BACK HOWEVER THE FACT THAT BOTH THE MOHAWKS AND THE SHAWNEES WERE PAINTED FOR WAR KEPT THEM ALERT TO THEIR DANGER
8587-295525-0003 I BELIEVE THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO KEEP GOING AHEAD UNTIL THE SUN GOES DOWN DECLARED RUNNING FOX THEN WE WILL CLIMB TO A HIGH PLACE AND LOOK FOR SMOKE IF WE DO NOT SEE IT THEN WE MUST CIRCLE AROUND YES WE MUST CLIMB TO ALL THE HIGH PLACES AND LOOK EVERY WAY
8587-295525-0004 I DO NOT BELIEVE THE MOHAWK CAMP IS BEYOND TWO SUNS JOURNEY AWAY
8587-295525-0005 I DO NOT SEE ANY OTHER WAY TO DO REPLIED SPOTTED DEER THEY RESUMED THEIR WAY INTO THE NORTH
8587-295525-0006 PERHAPS IT IS NOT NEAR THAT WATER SUGGESTED SPOTTED DEER PERHAPS WE HAVE GONE THE WRONG WAY NO I DO NOT BELIEVE IT SAID RUNNING FOX I AM THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THE MOHAWKS ARE AT WAR WITH THE SHAWNEES
8587-295525-0007 THEN HOW CAN WE FIND THE CAMP INQUIRED SPOTTED DEER
8587-295525-0008 WE MUST ASK GETANITTOWIT TO HELP US
8587-295525-0009 RUNNING FOX TO MAKE A HALF CIRCLE TOWARD THE EAST WHILE SPOTTED DEER MADE A SIMILAR DETOUR TOWARD THE WEST THEY AGREED TO MEET AT DARK AT A GREAT SPIRE SHAPED ROCK ON THE SUMMIT OF A LOW HILL DIRECTLY AHEAD OF THEM
8587-295525-0010 I WILL DO AS YOU TELL ME AGREED SPOTTED DEER RUNNING FOX MADE HIS WAY TOWARD A RIDGE OF HILLS LESS THAN A HALF DAY'S JOURNEY TO THE EASTWARD HE HAD TRAVELED ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE DISTANCE WHEN HE SUDDENLY CAME UPON THE REMAINS OF A SMALL FIRE
8587-295525-0011 AND CLEVERLY CONCEALED BY A SCREEN OF BRUSH
8587-295525-0012 HE FOUND SOME TRACKS LEADING TOWARD THE EAST
8587-295525-0013 I MUST WATCH OUT FOR THAT PERSON RUNNING FOX TOLD HIMSELF HE REACHED THE RIDGE OF HILLS A SHORT TIME AFTERWARD AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY TOWARD THE NORTH FOR EVIDENCE OF THE MOHAWK CAMP THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND CLOUDLESS HOWEVER AND THERE WAS NO TRACE OF SMOKE
8587-295525-0014 RUNNING FOX FELT TROUBLED
8587-295525-0015 STILL HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF TURNING BACK
8587-295525-0016 IT SUGGESTED MANY INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES AND RUNNING FOX STUDIED IT CLOSELY FOR A LONG TIME IT PUZZLED HIM
8587-295525-0017 BESIDES THERE WAS BUT ONE DENSE COLUMN OF SMOKE WHILE SMOKE FROM A VILLAGE USUALLY ROSE IN SEVERAL THIN COLUMNS OR HOVERED ABOVE THE CAMP IN LIGHT HAZY CLOUDS RUNNING FOX DECIDED THEREFORE THAT THE SMOKE WHICH HE SAW MUST BE A SIGNAL
8587-295525-0018 THE POSSIBILITY QUICKENED HIS INTEREST
8587-295525-0019 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE SAW IT SEPARATE INTO A NUMBER OF PUFFS OR CLOUDS
8587-295525-0020 HE SEARCHED THE SKY IN ALL DIRECTIONS HOPING TO SEE AN ANSWER BUT NONE APPEARED I BELIEVE SOME ONE IS TALKING TO THE MOHAWK CAMP SAID RUNNING FOX THE DELAWARE REALIZED THAT IF HIS GUESS WAS TRUE IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THAT THE SIGNAL WOULD GO UNANSWERED
8587-295525-0021 HE HURRIED AWAY TO MEET SPOTTED DEER
8587-295525-0022 THIS TIME HOWEVER HIS SIGNAL BROUGHT AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FOR SPOTTED DEER WAS WAITING FOR HIM WE HAVE FOUND EACH OTHER IT IS GOOD SAID SPOTTED DEER IT IS GOOD MY BROTHER REPLIED RUNNING FOX HAVE YOU LOOKED AROUND
8587-295525-0023 YES I HAVE CIRCLED ALL AROUND THIS HILL THERE IS NO ONE HIDING HERE SPOTTED DEER ASSURED HIM
8587-295525-0024 RUNNING FOX TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN TO THE EASTWARD AND SPOTTED DEER LISTENED WITH GREAT ATTENTION THE SMOKE PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED HIM
8587-295525-0025 PERHAPS THAT SMOKE WAS SENT UP BY THE SHAWNEES HE SUGGESTED PERHAPS A MOHAWK SCOUT WAS TALKING WITH THE WAR PARTY WELL IT MAY TURN OUT THAT WAY BUT I FEEL DIFFERENT ABOUT IT INSISTED RUNNING FOX NOW YOU MUST TELL ME WHAT YOU FOUND OUT
8587-295525-0026 SPOTTED DEER SAID THAT HE HAD GONE A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE TOWARD THE WEST WITHOUT DISCOVERING ANY SIGNS OF HIS FOES THEN HE HAD CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN TO RECONNOITER
8587-295525-0027 BUT IT FADED FROM THE SKY BEFORE HE COULD CONVINCE HIMSELF THEN HE HAD SET OUT TO MEET RUNNING FOX THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED CONCLUDED SPOTTED DEER WELL WE HAVE NOT DONE MUCH RUNNING FOX DECLARED GLOOMILY
8587-295525-0028 THIS TIME HOWEVER THEY REMAINED TOGETHER AND TURNED TOWARD THE NORTH RUNNING FOX FELT CONVINCED THAT THE VILLAGE WAS SOMEWHERE IN THAT DIRECTION
8587-295525-0029 I BELIEVE THERE MUST BE A TRAIL GOING TOWARD THAT CAMP DECLARED SPOTTED DEER
8587-295525-0030 AND THEN RUNNING FOX PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD CIRCLE TOWARD THE WEST THAT WILL BRING US NEAR THE PLACE WHERE YOU SAW SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE SMOKE HE TOLD SPOTTED DEER
8587-295525-0031 THEN FOR A LONG TIME THEY TRAVELED IN SILENCE RUNNING FOX SEEMED MOODY AND THOUGHTFUL AND SPOTTED DEER MADE NO ATTEMPT TO ROUSE HIM
8587-295525-0032 SPOTTED DEER THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT TROUBLE ME RUNNING FOX SAID FINALLY SPOTTED DEER REMAINED SILENT
8587-295525-0033 FIRST I AM TROUBLED BECAUSE I HAVE NOT FOUND GOKHOS THE GREAT WHITE MEDICINE OWL CONTINUED RUNNING FOX IF WE HAD THE SKIN OF THAT MYSTERIOUS BIRD I BELIEVE MUCH GOOD WOULD COME OF IT BUT I AM TROUBLED ABOUT ANOTHER THING YES I AM TROUBLED ABOUT THE SHAWNEES
8587-295525-0034 I BELIEVE THE MOHAWKS WILL KEEP MANY WARRIORS AROUND THE VILLAGE WELL NOW I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT
8587-295525-0035 THOSE ARE GOOD WORDS SPOTTED DEER DECLARED ADMIRINGLY YOU WILL SOON FIND GOKHOS THE GREAT WHITE MEDICINE OWL AND THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SOME GREAT THINGS I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE SHAWNEES STOP RUNNING FOX INTERRUPTED EXCITEDLY I SEE SMOKE RISING BEHIND THAT RIDGE
8587-295525-0036 THAT IS THE PLACE I WAS LOOKING AT SAID SPOTTED DEER
8587-295525-0037 I BELIEVE WE HAVE FOUND THE MOHAWK CAMP DECLARED RUNNING FOX WE MUST WATCH SHARP
8587-295525-0038 SPOTTED DEER I BELIEVE WE ARE IN GREAT DANGER
8587-295525-0039 THE THOUGHT FILLED THEM WITH JOY THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF THEIR GOAL AND THEY WERE EAGER TO VERIFY THEIR HOPES HOWEVER
8587-295525-0040 HE HAD LITTLE DOUBT THAT IF THE CAMP REALLY WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE
8587-295525-0041 THEREFORE HE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL NIGHT CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE WE MUST STAY HERE UNTIL IT GETS DARK HE TOLD SPOTTED DEER
