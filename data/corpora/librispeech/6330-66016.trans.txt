6330-66016-0000 HOLDING A BABY WHEN ADAM DELVED AND EVE SPAN THE FICTION THAT MAN IS INCAPABLE OF HOUSEWORK WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED
6330-66016-0001 IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIGURE OUT JUST HOW MANY FOOT POUNDS OF ENERGY MEN HAVE SAVED THEMSELVES SINCE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD BY KEEPING UP THE PRETENSE THAT A SPECIAL KNACK IS REQUIRED FOR WASHING DISHES AND FOR DUSTING AND THAT THE KNACK IS WHOLLY FEMININE
6330-66016-0002 THE PRETENSE OF INCAPACITY IS IMPUDENT IN ITS AUDACITY AND YET IT WORKS
6330-66016-0003 MEN BUILD BRIDGES AND THROW RAILROADS ACROSS DESERTS AND YET THEY CONTEND SUCCESSFULLY THAT THE JOB OF SEWING ON A BUTTON IS BEYOND THEM ACCORDINGLY THEY DON'T HAVE TO SEW BUTTONS
6330-66016-0004 IT MIGHT BE SAID OF COURSE THAT THE SAFETY OF SUSPENSION BRIDGES IS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT OF SUSPENDERS THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOR IS ONLY FAIR
6330-66016-0005 BUT THERE ARE MANY OF US WHO HAVE NEVER THROWN A RAILROAD IN OUR LIVES AND YET SWAGGER IN ALL THE GLORY OF MASCULINE ACHIEVEMENT WITHOUT UNDERTAKING ANY OF THE DRUDGERY OF ODD JOBS
6330-66016-0006 PROBABLY MEN ALONE COULD NEVER HAVE MAINTAINED THE FALLACY OF MASCULINE INCAPACITY WITHOUT THE AID OF WOMEN AS SOON AS THAT RATHER LIMITED SPHERE ONCE KNOWN AS WOMAN'S PLACE WAS ESTABLISHED
6330-66016-0007 WOMEN BEGAN TO GLORIFY AND EXAGGERATE ITS IMPORTANCE BY THE PRETENSE THAT IT WAS ALL SO SPECIAL AND DIFFICULT THAT NO OTHER SEX COULD POSSIBLY BEGIN TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASKS ENTAILED TO THIS DECLARATION MEN GAVE IMMEDIATE AND EAGER ASSENT
6330-66016-0008 NATURALLY THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS BIOLOGY HAS BEEN UNSCRUPULOUS ENOUGH TO DISCRIMINATE MARKEDLY AGAINST WOMEN AND MEN HAVE SEIZED UPON THIS ADVANTAGE TO PRESS THE BELIEF THAT SINCE THE BEARING OF CHILDREN IS EXCLUSIVELY THE PROVINCE OF WOMEN
6330-66016-0009 IT MUST BE THAT ALL THE CARING FOR THEM BELONGS PROPERLY TO THE SAME SEX YET HOW RIDICULOUS THIS IS MOST THINGS WHICH HAVE TO BE DONE FOR CHILDREN ARE OF THE SIMPLEST SORT THEY SHOULD TAX THE INTELLIGENCE OF NO ONE
6330-66016-0010 MEN PROFESS A TOTAL LACK OF ABILITY TO WASH BABY'S FACE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THERE'S NO GREAT FUN IN THE BUSINESS AT EITHER END OF THE SPONGE PROTECTIVELY MAN MUST GO THE WHOLE DISTANCE AND PRETEND THAT THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE THING
6330-66016-0011 WHICH HE CAN DO FOR BABY HE MUST EVEN MAINTAIN THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO HOLD ONE FROM THIS PRETENSE HAS GROWN THE SHOCKINGLY TRANSPARENT FALLACY THAT HOLDING A BABY CORRECTLY IS ONE OF THE FINE ARTS OR PERHAPS EVEN MORE FEARSOME THAN THAT
6330-66016-0012 A WONDERFUL INTUITION WHICH HAS COME DOWN AFTER CENTURIES OF EFFORT TO WOMEN ONLY THE THING THAT SURPRISED RICHARD MOST SAYS A RECENT WOMAN NOVELIST
6330-66016-0013 SHE SEEMED TO KNOW BY INSTINCT THINGS THAT RICHARD COULD NOT UNDERSTAND AND THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW SHE CAME BY IF SHE REACHED OUT HER HANDS TO TAKE ANNABEL HER FINGERS SEEMED OF THEMSELVES
6330-66016-0014 TO CURVE INTO THE PLACES WHERE THEY WOULD FIT THE SPINELESS BUNDLE AND GIVE IT SUPPORT AT THIS POINT INTERRUPTION IS INEVITABLE PLACES INDEED THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT WAYS OF HOLDING A BABY AND ALL ARE RIGHT
6330-66016-0015 THERE IS NO NEED OF SEEKING OUT SPECIAL PLACES FOR THE HANDS A BABY IS SO SOFT THAT ANYBODY WITH A FIRM GRIP CAN MAKE PLACES FOR AN EFFECTIVE HOLD WHEREVER HE CHOOSES BUT TO RETURN TO OUR QUOTATION
6330-66016-0016 IF RICHARD TRIED TO TAKE UP THE BUNDLE HIS FINGERS FELL AWAY LIKE THE LEGS OF THE BRITTLE CRAB AND THE BUNDLE COLLAPSED INCALCULABLE AND HELPLESS HOW DO YOU DO IT HE WOULD SAY
6330-66016-0017 AND HE WOULD RIGHT ANNABEL AND TRY TO STILL HER PROTESTS AND ELEANOR WOULD ONLY SMILE GENTLY AND SEND HIM ON SOME MASCULINE ERRAND WHILE SHE SOOTHED ANNABEL'S FEELINGS IN THE PROPER WAY
6330-66016-0018 YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THAT RICHARD ALSO SMILED AS SOON AS HE WAS SAFELY OUT OF THE HOUSE AND EMBARKED UPON SOME MASCULINE ERRAND SUCH AS PLAYING EIGHTEEN HOLES OF GOLF PROBABLY BY THE TIME HE REACHED THE TENTH GREEN
6330-66016-0019 I ONCE KNEW THE WIFE OF THE GREATEST BILLIARD PLAYER IN THE WORLD AND SHE INFORMED ME WITH MUCH PRIDE THAT HER HUSBAND WAS INCAPABLE OF CARRYING THE BABY HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE PROPER TOUCH SHE EXPLAINED AS A MATTER OF FACT
6330-66016-0020 EVEN IF MEN IN GENERAL WERE AS AWKWARD AS THEY PRETEND TO BE AT HOME THERE WOULD STILL BE SMALL REASON FOR THEIR SHIRKING THE TASK OF CARRYING A BABY EXCEPT THAT RIGHT SIDE UP IS BEST THERE IS NOT MUCH TO LEARN AS I VENTURED TO SUGGEST BEFORE
6330-66016-0021 ALMOST ANY FIRM GRIP WILL DO OF COURSE THE CHILD MAY CRY BUT THAT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS BECOME OVER PARTICULAR THROUGH TOO MUCH CODDLING NATURE HERSELF IS CAVALIER
6330-66016-0022 YOUNG RABBITS DON'T EVEN WHIMPER WHEN PICKED UP BY THE EARS AND KITTENS ARE QUITE CONTENTED TO BE LIFTED BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK THIS SAME NATURE HAS BEEN USED AS THE PRINCIPAL ARGUMENT FOR WOMAN'S EXCLUSIVE ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THE YOUNG
6330-66016-0023 IT IS PRETTY GENERALLY HELD THAT ALL A WOMAN NEEDS TO DO TO KNOW ALL ABOUT CHILDREN IS TO HAVE SOME THIS WISDOM IS ATTRIBUTED TO INSTINCT AGAIN AND AGAIN WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY RAPTUROUS GRANDMOTHERS THAT
6330-66016-0024 IT ISN'T SOMETHING WHICH CAN BE READ IN A BOOK OR TAUGHT IN A SCHOOL NATURE IS THE GREAT TEACHER THIS SIMPLY ISN'T TRUE THERE ARE MANY MOTHERS IN AMERICA WHO HAVE LEARNED FAR MORE FROM THE MANUALS OF DOCTOR HOLT THAN INSTINCT EVER TAUGHT THEM
6330-66016-0025 IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE I HAVE NO FEELING OF BEING A TRAITOR TO MY SEX WHEN I SAY THAT I BELIEVE IN AT LEAST A ROUGH EQUALITY OF PARENTHOOD IN SHIRKING ALL THE BUSINESS OF CARING FOR CHILDREN WE HAVE ESCAPED MUCH HARD LABOR IT HAS BEEN CONVENIENT
6330-66016-0026 PERHAPS IT HAS BEEN TOO CONVENIENT IF WE HAVE AVOIDED ARDUOUS TASKS WE HAVE ALSO MISSED MUCH FUN OF A VERY SPECIAL KIND LIKE CHILDREN IN A TOY SHOP WE HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE WITH THE MOST AMUSING OF TALKING AND WALKING DOLLS
6330-66016-0027 WITHOUT EVER ATTEMPTING TO TEAR DOWN THE SIGN WHICH SAYS DO NOT TOUCH IN FACT WE HAVE HELPED TO SET IT IN PLACE THAT IS A PITY CHILDREN MEAN NOTHING AT LONG RANGE
6330-66016-0028 THIS MAY BE THE REASON WHY SO MANY TRAINED NURSES MARRY THEIR PATIENTS
6330-66016-0029 A DISH IS AN UNRESPONSIVE THING IT GIVES BACK NOTHING A CHILD'S FACE OFFERS COMPETITIVE POSSIBILITIES IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE JUST HOW HIGH A POLISH CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT MAKING IT CRY
6330-66016-0030 YOU HAVE A SENSE OF IMPORTANCE ALMOST DIVINE IN ITS EXTENT THIS IS TO FEEL AT ONE WITH FATE TO BE THE MASTER OF ANOTHER'S DESTINY OF HIS WAKING AND HIS SLEEPING AND HIS GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD
6330-66016-0031 IT IS A BRAND NEW WORLD FOR THE CHILD HE IS A VERITABLE ADAM AND YOU LOOM UP IN HIS LIFE AS MORE THAN MORTAL GOLF IS WELL ENOUGH FOR A SUNDAY SPORT
6330-66016-0032 BUT IT IS A TRIFLING THING BESIDE THE PRIVILEGE OF TAKING A SMALL SON TO THE ZOO AND LETTING HIM SEE HIS FIRST LION HIS FIRST TIGER AND BEST OF ALL HIS FIRST ELEPHANT PROBABLY HE WILL THINK THAT THEY ARE PART OF YOUR OWN HANDIWORK
6330-66016-0033 TURNED OUT FOR HIS PLEASURE TO A CHILD AT LEAST EVEN THE MEANEST OF US MAY SEEM GLAMOUROUS WITH MAGIC AND WISDOM IT SEEMS A PITY NOT TO TAKE THE FULLEST ADVANTAGE OF THIS CHANCE BEFORE THE OPPORTUNITY IS LOST
6330-66016-0034 CORTES ON HIS LONELY PEAK IN DARIEN WAS A PIGMY DISCOVERER BESIDE THE CHILD EATING HIS FIRST SPOONFUL OF ICE CREAM
6330-66016-0035 THERE IS THE IMMEDIATE FRIGHTENED AND ANGRY REBELLION AGAINST THE COLDNESS OF IT AND THEN THE AMAZING SENSATION AS THE STRANGE SUBSTANCE MELTS INTO MAGIC OF PLEASANT SWEETNESS THE CHILD WILL GO ON TO HIGH ADVENTURE
6330-66016-0036 BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THE WORLD HOLDS FOR ANY ONE MORE SOUL STIRRING SURPRISE THAN THE FIRST ADVENTURE WITH ICE CREAM NO THERE IS NOTHING DULL IN FEEDING A CHILD
6330-66016-0037 THERE IS LESS TO BE SAID FOR DRESSING A CHILD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RECREATION THIS SEEMS TO US LABORIOUS AND RATHER TIRESOME BOTH FOR FATHER AND CHILD STILL I KNEW ONE MAN WHO MANAGED TO MAKE AN ADVENTURE OF IT
6330-66016-0038 HE BOASTED THAT HE HAD BROKEN ALL THE RECORDS OF THE WORLD FOR CHANGING ALL OR ANY PART OF A CHILD'S CLOTHING HE WAS A SKILLED AUTOMOBILE MECHANIC MUCH IN DEMAND IN RACES WHERE TIRES ARE WHISKED ON AND OFF HE BROUGHT HIS TECHNIC INTO THE HOME
6330-66016-0039 I SAW SEVERAL OF HIS DEMONSTRATIONS HE WAS A SILENT MAN WHO HABITUALLY CARRIED A MOUTHFUL OF SAFETY PINS ONCE THE REQUIRED YOUNGSTER HAD BEEN POINTED OUT HE WASTED NO TIME IN PRELIMINARY WHEEDLINGS
6330-66016-0040 BUT TOSSED HER ON THE FLOOR WITHOUT MORE ADO EVEN BEFORE HER HEAD HAD BUMPED HE WOULD BE HARD AT WORK WITH HIM THE THRILL LAY IN THE INSPIRATION OF THE COMPETITIVE SPIRIT
