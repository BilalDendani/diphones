922-132300-0000 CONVERT FELDMAN FOUGHT FOR CONTROL OF HIMSELF FORCED HIMSELF TO THINK TO HOLD ONTO HIS SANITY
922-132300-0001 BUT THE WILL TO BE HIMSELF WAS STRONGER THAN LOGIC AND BIT BY BIT HE FORCED THE FEAR AND HORROR AWAY FROM HIM UNTIL HE COULD EXAMINE HIS SITUATION HE WAS SPINNING SLOWLY SO THAT STARS AHEAD OF HIM SEEMED TO CRAWL ACROSS HIS VIEW
922-132300-0002 THE SHIP WAS RETREATING FROM HIM ALREADY HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY MARS WAS A SHRUNKEN PILL FAR AWAY THEN SOMETHING BLINKED TO ONE SIDE HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO STARE
922-132300-0003 A LITTLE SHIP WAS LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY HE RECOGNIZED IT AS A LIFE RAFT NOW HIS SPIN BROUGHT HIM AROUND TO FACE IT AND HE SAW IT WAS PARALLELLING HIS COURSE
922-132300-0004 THE EJECTION OF THE LIFE RAFT MUST HAVE CAUSED THE THUMP HE'D HEARD BEFORE HE WAS CAST ADRIFT IT MEANT SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO SAVE HIM IT MEANT LIFE HE FLAILED HIS ARMS AND BEAT HIS LEGS TOGETHER
922-132300-0005 AND THE LITTLE SHIP LEAPED FORWARD WHOEVER WAS HANDLING IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT PILOTING IT PICKED UP TOO MUCH SPEED AT TOO GREAT AN ANGLE AGAIN BLUE SPURTS CAME BUT THIS TIME MATTERS WERE EVEN WORSE
922-132300-0006 THEN THERE WAS A LONG WAIT BEFORE A THIRD TRY WAS MADE HE ESTIMATED THE COURSE IT WOULD MISS HIM BY A GOOD HUNDRED FEET BUT IT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST THE AMATEUR PILOT COULD DO THE SHIP DRIFTED CLOSER BUT TO ONE SIDE IT WOULD SOON PASS HIM COMPLETELY
922-132300-0007 A SPACESUITED FIGURE SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE TINY AIRLOCK HOLDING A COIL OF ROPE THE ROPE SHOT OUT WELL THROWN BUT IT WAS TOO SHORT IT WOULD PASS WITHIN TEN FEET AND MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN TEN MILES FOR ALL THE GOOD IT WOULD DO HIM
922-132300-0008 EVERY FILM HE HAD SEEN ON SPACE SEEMED TO FORM A MAD JUMBLE IN HIS MIND BUT HE SEIZED ON THE FIRST IDEA HE COULD REMEMBER HE INHALED DEEPLY AND YANKED THE OXYGEN TANK FREE AN AUTOMATIC SEAL ON THE SUIT CUT OFF THE CONNECTION
922-132300-0009 HE AIMED THE HISSING BOTTLE FUMBLING FOR THE MANUAL VALVE IT ALMOST WORKED IT KICKED HIM TOWARD THE ROPE SLIGHTLY BUT MOST OF THE ENERGY WAS WASTED IN SETTING HIM INTO A WILDER SPIN HE BLINKED TRYING TO SPOT THE ROPE
922-132300-0010 IT WAS WITHIN FIVE FEET NOW AGAIN HE WAITED UNTIL HE SEEMED TO BE IN POSITION THIS TIME HE THREW THE BOTTLE AWAY FROM IT IT ADDED SPIN TO HIS VERTICAL AXIS BUT THE ROPE CAME INTO VIEW WITHIN ARM'S REACH HE GRASPED IT
922-132300-0011 JUST AS HIS LUNGS SEEMED ABOUT TO BURST HE COULDN'T HOLD ON LONG ENOUGH TO TIE THE ROPE HIS LUNGS GAVE UP SUDDENLY COLLAPSING AND THEN SUCKING IN GREEDILY CLEAN AIR RUSHED IN LETTING HIS HEAD CLEAR
922-132300-0012 HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT THE INFLATED SUIT HELD ENOUGH OXYGEN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HIS BODY STRUCK THE EDGE OF THE AIRLOCK AND A HAND JERKED HIM INSIDE THE OUTER SEAL WAS SLAMMED SHUT AND LOCKED AND THERE WAS A HISS OF AIR ENTERING
922-132300-0013 HE THREW BACK HIS HELMET JUST AS CHRIS RYAN JERKED HERS OFF HER VOICE SHOOK ALMOST HYSTERICALLY THANK GOD DAN I ALMOST GAVE UP I LIKED THE AIR OUT THERE BETTER HE TOLD HER BITTERLY IF YOU'LL OPEN THE LOCK AGAIN I'LL LEAVE
922-132300-0014 I CAME ALONG TO SEE YOU KILLED AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL SAVING YOU WASN'T IN MY ORDERS HE GRUNTED AND REACHED FOR THE HANDLE THAT WOULD RELEASE THE OUTER LOCK
922-132300-0015 IT'S UP TO YOU DAN SHE TOLD HIM AND THERE WAS ALL THE SINCERITY IN THE WORLD IN HER BLUE EYES I'M ON YOUR SIDE NOW HE BEGAN COUNTING ON HIS FINGERS LET'S SEE THE SPARE BATTERY
922-132300-0016 THE DELAY IN ARRESTING ME THE CHOICE OF MATTHEWS IT WAS ALL TRUE ANGER BEGAN TO GROW IN HER EYES DAN FELDMAN YOU GET INSIDE THIS RAFT IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THE PEOPLE DYING OF THE PLAGUE WHO NEED YOU
922-132300-0017 ADDRESSED TO MISSUS D E EVERTS AND SIGNED BY ONE OF THE BEST DOCTORS ON THE LOBBY BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGRET CONFIRM DIAGNOSIS TOPSECRET REPEAT TOPSECRET MARTIAN FEVER INCUBATES FOURTEEN YEARS BELIEVED HIGHLY FATAL NO CURE
922-132300-0018 RESEARCH BEGINNING IMMEDIATELY PENALTY VIOLATION TOPSECRET DEATH ALL CONCERNED MISSUS EVERTS RATES A TOPSECRET BREAK DOC COMMENTED DRYLY COME OFF IT CHRIS SHE'S THE DAUGHTER OF ELMERS OF SPACE LOBBY CHRIS ANSWERED
922-132300-0019 SHE POINTED TO THE MESSAGE UNDERLINING WORDS WITH HER FINGER FOURTEEN YEARS YOU COULDN'T HAVE CAUSED IT HIGHLY FATAL AND PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD IT'S ONLY A SKIN DISEASE RESEARCH BEGINNING BUT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE MOST OF THE RESEARCH I CAN SEE THAT NOW
922-132300-0020 I CAN'T PROVE MY MOTIVES YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE ME BUT IT WASN'T HARD TO DO WHAT I'VE DONE THAT SHUTTLE PILOT WAS FOUND IN A ROUTINE CHECK STOWED AWAY ON THE LIFE RAFT I WAS WITH CAPTAIN EVERTS WHEN HE WAS FOUND SO I DISCOVERED HOW TO GET INTO THE RAFT
922-132300-0021 THE PILOT'S FAREWELL ADDRESSING HIM AS DOCTOR FELDMAN HAD BEEN TOO LOW FOR HER TO HEAR BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT FITTED HER STORY IT WAS PROBABLY A DELIBERATE CLUE TO GIVE HIM HOPE TO ASSURE HIM THE VILLAGES WERE STILL TRYING IT SHOOK HIS CONFIDENCE
922-132300-0022 AND YOU'VE DECIDED YOUR PRECIOUS LOBBY WON'T SAVE YOU SHE DROPPED HER EYES THEN RAISED THEM TO MEET HIS DEFIANTLY I'M NOT JUST SCARED AND SELFISH DAD CAUGHT IT TOO AND IT MUST BE CLOSE TO THE TIME FOR HIM
922-132300-0023 THERE WAS A MANUAL LEVER WHICH CHRIS MUST HAVE USED BEFORE IT MIGHT WORK OUT HERE WHERE THERE WAS ROOM TO MANEUVER AND NOTHING TO HIT BUT TRYING TO MAKE A LANDING WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT DAN SHE REPEATED HE SHRUGGED I DON'T KNOW
922-132300-0024 THEY'VE STARTED RESEARCH TOO LATE AND THEY'LL BE UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE THAT THE REAL BRAINS WON'T HAVE A CHANCE THE TOPSECRET STUFF LOOKS BAD FOR RESEARCH MAYBE THERE'S A CURE IT WORKS IN CULTURE BOTTLES BUT IT MAY FAIL IN PERSON
922-132300-0025 WHEN I'M CONVINCED I'M SAFE WITH YOU I MAY TELL YOU ABOUT IT OH HER VOICE WAS LOW THEN SHE SIGHED I SUPPOSE I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HATE ME DAN I DON'T HATE YOU I'M TOO MIXED UP TOMORROW MAYBE BUT NOT NOW
922-132300-0026 SHUT UP AND LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO LAND THIS THING HE FOUND THAT THE FUEL TANKS WERE NEARLY FULL BUT THAT STILL DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH MARGIN
922-132300-0027 THEY HAD NO ASPIRATORS HOWEVER AND THEY COULDN'T COVER MUCH TERRITORY IN THE SPACESUITS THEY WOULD HAVE TO USE IT MEANT HE'D HAVE TO LAND CLOSE TO A VILLAGE WHERE HE WAS KNOWN HE JOCKEYED THE SHIP AROUND BY TRIAL AND ERROR STUDYING THE MANUAL THAT WAS LYING PROMINENTLY ON THE CONTROL PANEL
922-132300-0028 ACCORDING TO THE BOOKLET THE SHIP WAS SIMPLE TO OPERATE IT WAS SELF LEVELING IN AN ATMOSPHERE AND AUTOMATIC FLARE COMPUTERS WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR AN AMATEUR TO JUDGE THE RATE OF DESCENT NEAR THE SURFACE IT LOOKED REASSURING AND WAS PROBABLY WRITTEN WITH THAT IN MIND
922-132300-0029 FINALLY HE REACHED FOR THE CONTROL HOPING HE'D FIGURED HIS LANDING ORBIT REASONABLY WELL BY SIMPLE LOGIC HE SMOOTHED IT OUT IN THE FOLLOWING HOURS AS HE WATCHED THE MARKINGS ON MARS WHEN THEY WERE NEAR TURNOVER POINT
922-132300-0030 HE BEGAN CRANKING THE LITTLE GYROSCOPE TO SWING THE SHIP IT SAVED FUEL TO TURN WITHOUT POWER
922-132300-0031 HE WAS GAINING SOME PROFICIENCY HOWEVER HE FELT BUT NOW HE HAD TO WASTE FUEL AND RUIN HIS ORBIT AGAIN THERE WAS NO WAY TO PRACTICE MANEUVERING WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING SO IN THE END HE COMPROMISED
922-132300-0032 LEAVING A SMALL MARGIN FOR A BAD LANDING THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SECOND ATTEMPT BUT WITH LESS PRACTICE THAN HE WANTED HE HAD LOCATED JAKE'S VILLAGE THROUGH THE LITTLE TELESCOPE WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED FOR THE MAIN BLAST CONTROL
922-132300-0033 WHILE THE BLAST LASHED OUT THEN THEY WERE IN THE OUTER FRINGES OF THE SKY AND THE BLAST WAS BEGINNING TO SHOW A CORONA THAT RUINED VISIBILITY HE TURNED TO THE FLARE COMPUTER AND BACK TO WHAT HE COULD SEE THROUGH THE QUARTZ VIEWPORT
922-132300-0034 AS NEARLY AS HE COULD JUDGE THE COMPUTER SEEMED TO WORK AS IT SHOULD THE SPEED WAS WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS
922-132300-0035 THE FLARE BLOOMED AND HE YANKED DOWN ON THE LITTLE LEVER IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THEY HIT THE GROUND BOUNCED TWICE AND TURNED OVER THE SHIP WAS A MESS WHEN FELDMAN FREED HIMSELF FROM THE ELASTIC STRAPS OF THE SEAT
922-132300-0036 CHRIS HAD SHRIEKED AS THEY HIT BUT SHE WAS UNBUCKLING HERSELF NOW HE THREW HER HER SPACESUIT AND ONE OF THE EMERGENCY BOTTLES OF OXYGEN FROM THE RACK HURRY UP WITH THAT
922-132300-0037 THEY WERE HALFWAY TO THE VILLAGE WHEN A DOZEN TRACTORS CAME RACING UP AND JAKE PILED OUT OF THE LEAD ONE TO DRAG THE TWO IN WITH HIM HEARD ABOUT IT FROM THE BROADCASTS AND FIGURED YOU MIGHT LAND AROUND HERE GOOD TO SEE YOU DOC
922-132300-0038 HE STARTED THE TRACTOR OFF AT FULL SPEED BACK TO THE WASTELANDS WHILE DOC STARED AT THE ARMED MEN WHO WERE RIDING THE TRACTORS JAKE CAUGHT HIS LOOK AND NODDED YOU'RE IN ENEMY TERRITORY DOC
