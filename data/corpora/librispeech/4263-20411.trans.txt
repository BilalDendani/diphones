4263-20411-0000 WEISS WOULD CALL IN SOME OTHER DOCTOR
4263-20411-0001 THIS WAS MY VIEW BUT I MEANT TO HAVE THORNDYKE'S OPINION AND ACT UNDER HIS DIRECTION BUT THE BEST LAID PLANS OF MICE AND MEN GANG AFT AGLEY WHEN I CAME DOWNSTAIRS AND TOOK A PRELIMINARY GLANCE AT THE ROUGH MEMORANDUM BOOK KEPT BY THE BOTTLE BOY
4263-20411-0002 OR IN HIS ABSENCE BY THE HOUSEMAID I STOOD AGHAST THE MORNING'S ENTRIES LOOKED ALREADY LIKE A SAMPLE PAGE OF THE POST OFFICE DIRECTORY THE NEW CALLS ALONE WERE MORE THAN EQUAL TO AN ORDINARY DAY'S WORK AND THE ROUTINE VISITS REMAINED TO BE ADDED
4263-20411-0003 GLOOMILY WONDERING WHETHER THE BLACK DEATH HAD MADE A SUDDEN REAPPEARANCE IN ENGLAND I HURRIED TO THE DINING ROOM AND MADE A HASTY BREAKFAST INTERRUPTED AT INTERVALS BY THE APPARITION OF THE BOTTLE BOY TO ANNOUNCE NEW MESSAGES THE FIRST TWO OR THREE VISITS SOLVED THE MYSTERY
4263-20411-0004 AN EPIDEMIC OF INFLUENZA HAD DESCENDED ON THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I WAS GETTING NOT ONLY
4263-20411-0005 MEMBERS OF A CERTAIN BENEFIT CLUB WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE REMARKABLE SUDDENNESS OF THE OUTBREAK OF COURSE MY CONTEMPLATED VISIT TO THORNDYKE WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION I SHOULD HAVE TO ACT ON MY OWN RESPONSIBILITY BUT
4263-20411-0006 IN THE HURRY AND RUSH AND ANXIETY OF THE WORK FOR SOME OF THE CASES WERE SEVERE AND EVEN CRITICAL
4263-20411-0007 EVEN WITH THE AID OF A HANSOM WHICH I CHARTERED AS STILLBURY KEPT NO CARRIAGE I HAD NOT FINISHED MY LAST VISIT UNTIL NEAR ON MIDNIGHT AND WAS THEN SO SPENT WITH FATIGUE THAT I FELL ASLEEP OVER MY POSTPONED SUPPER
4263-20411-0008 AS THE NEXT DAY OPENED WITH A FURTHER INCREASE OF WORK I SENT A TELEGRAM TO DOCTOR STILLBURY AT HASTINGS WHITHER HE HAD GONE
4263-20411-0009 I ASKED FOR AUTHORITY TO ENGAGE AN ASSISTANT
4263-20411-0010 I FOUND HIM RUBBING HIS HANDS OVER THE OPEN DAY BOOK IT'S AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY GOOD HE REMARKED CHEERFULLY AS WE SHOOK HANDS
4263-20411-0011 BY THE WAY YOU ARE NOT ANXIOUS TO BE OFF I SUPPOSE AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS FOR I HAD DECIDED TO ACCEPT THORNDYKE'S OFFER AND WAS NOW EAGER TO TAKE UP MY DUTIES WITH HIM
4263-20411-0012 THE SERVICES OF A STRANGE ASSISTANT I SHOULD LIKE TO GET OFF AS SOON AS YOU CAN SPARE ME I REPLIED BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU IN THE LURCH THAT'S A GOOD FELLOW SAID STILLBURY I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LET US HAVE SOME TEA AND DIVIDE UP THE WORK ANYTHING OF INTEREST GOING
4263-20411-0013 THERE WERE ONE OR TWO UNUSUAL CASES ON THE LIST AND AS WE MARKED OFF OUR RESPECTIVE PATIENTS I GAVE HIM THE HISTORIES IN BRIEF SYNOPSIS AND THEN I OPENED THE SUBJECT OF MY MYSTERIOUS EXPERIENCES AT THE HOUSE OF MISTER WEISS
4263-20411-0014 THERE'S ANOTHER AFFAIR THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT RATHER AN UNPLEASANT BUSINESS OH DEAR EXCLAIMED STILLBURY HE PUT DOWN HIS CUP AND REGARDED ME WITH QUITE PAINFUL ANXIETY IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE AN UNDOUBTED CASE OF CRIMINAL POISONING I CONTINUED
4263-20411-0015 STILLBURY'S FACE CLEARED INSTANTLY OH I'M GLAD IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN THAT HE SAID WITH AN AIR OF RELIEF I WAS AFRAID IT WAS SOME CONFOUNDED WOMAN THERE'S ALWAYS THAT DANGER YOU KNOW WHEN A LOCUM IS YOUNG AND HAPPENS IF I MAY SAY SO JERVIS TO BE A GOOD LOOKING FELLOW
4263-20411-0016 YES HE ADMITTED RELUCTANTLY I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT DEUCED UNPLEASANT THOUGH
4263-20411-0017 KEEP YOU HANGING ABOUT TO GIVE EVIDENCE STILL YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT WE CAN'T STAND BY AND SEE THE POOR DEVIL POISONED WITHOUT MAKING SOME EFFORT
4263-20411-0018 DON'T YOU REALLY NO I DON'T
4263-20411-0019 NOT ON YOUR EVIDENCE JERVIS THEY MIGHT PICK UP SOMETHING FRESH BUT IF THEY DIDN'T THEY WOULD FAIL YOU HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH HARD BAKED FACTS TO UPSET A CAPABLE DEFENCE STILL THAT ISN'T OUR AFFAIR
4263-20411-0020 THERE OUGHT NOT TO BE ANY DELAY SAID I THERE NEEDN'T BE I SHALL LOOK IN ON MISSUS WACKFORD AND YOU HAVE TO SEE THE RUMMEL CHILDREN WE SHALL PASS THE STATION ON OUR WAY
4263-20411-0021 THE SUGGESTION MET MY VIEWS EXACTLY AS SOON AS WE HAD FINISHED TEA WE SET FORTH
4263-20411-0022 CAREFULLY LAYING DOWN HIS PEN SHOOK HANDS CORDIALLY AND WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU GENTLEMEN HE ASKED WITH AN AFFABLE SMILE STILLBURY PROCEEDED TO OPEN OUR BUSINESS MY FRIEND HERE DOCTOR JERVIS
4263-20411-0023 SOMETHING IN MY LINE OF BUSINESS THE OFFICER INQUIRED THAT SAID I
4263-20411-0024 AND HEREUPON WITHOUT FURTHER PREAMBLE I PLUNGED INTO THE HISTORY OF THE CASE GIVING HIM A CONDENSED STATEMENT SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY MADE TO STILLBURY HE LISTENED WITH CLOSE ATTENTION JOTTING DOWN FROM TIME TO TIME A BRIEF NOTE ON A SHEET OF PAPER
4263-20411-0025 AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE WROTE OUT IN A BLACK COVERED NOTEBOOK A SHORT PRECIS OF MY STATEMENT I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN HERE HE SAID
4263-20411-0026 I WILL READ THE DEPOSITION OVER TO YOU AND IF IT IS CORRECT I WILL ASK YOU TO SIGN IT HE DID SO AND WHEN I HAD SIGNED THE DOCUMENT I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS LIKELY TO BE DONE IN THE MATTER I AM AFRAID HE REPLIED THAT WE CAN'T TAKE ANY ACTIVE MEASURES
4263-20411-0027 BUT I THINK THAT IS ALL WE CAN DO UNLESS WE HEAR SOMETHING FURTHER BUT
4263-20411-0028 I DO HE REPLIED
4263-20411-0029 IT SEEMS A PITY NOT TO TAKE SOME MEASURES I SAID WHILE YOU ARE WAITING TO HEAR SOMETHING FURTHER THEY MAY GIVE THE POOR WRETCH A FRESH DOSE AND KILL HIM IN WHICH CASE WE SHOULD HEAR SOMETHING FURTHER
4263-20411-0030 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU SIR BUT WE'VE NO EVIDENCE THAT HE IS GOING TO DIE HIS FRIENDS SENT FOR YOU AND YOU TREATED HIM SKILFULLY AND LEFT HIM IN A FAIR WAY TO RECOVERY
4263-20411-0031 YES I KNOW THE OFFICER CONTINUED AS I MADE SIGNS OF DISAGREEMENT
4263-20411-0032 BUT YOU OVERRATE OUR POWERS
4263-20411-0033 NOW WE HAVE NO SUCH EVIDENCE LOOK AT YOUR STATEMENT AND TELL ME WHAT YOU CAN SWEAR TO
4263-20411-0034 AND WHO GAVE HIM THAT POISONOUS DOSE I VERY STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT'S NO GOOD SIR
4263-20411-0035 SUSPICION ISN'T EVIDENCE WE SHOULD WANT YOU TO SWEAR AN INFORMATION AND GIVE US ENOUGH FACTS TO MAKE OUT A PRIMA FACIE CASE AGAINST SOME DEFINITE PERSON AND YOU COULDN'T DO IT YOUR INFORMATION AMOUNTS TO THIS THAT A CERTAIN PERSON HAS TAKEN A POISONOUS DOSE OF MORPHINE AND APPARENTLY RECOVERED THAT'S ALL
4263-20411-0036 YOU CAN'T SWEAR THAT THE NAMES GIVEN TO YOU ARE REAL NAMES AND YOU CAN'T GIVE US ANY ADDRESS OR EVEN ANY LOCALITY I TOOK SOME COMPASS BEARINGS IN THE CARRIAGE I SAID YOU COULD LOCATE THE HOUSE I THINK WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY
4263-20411-0037 THE OFFICER SMILED FAINTLY AND FIXED AN ABSTRACTED GAZE ON THE CLOCK YOU COULD SIR HE REPLIED I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT YOU COULD I COULDN'T
4263-20411-0038 GOOD EVENING DOCTOR STILLBURY HE SHOOK HANDS WITH US BOTH GENIALLY AND ACCEPTING PERFORCE THIS VERY POLITE BUT UNMISTAKABLE DISMISSAL WE TOOK OUR DEPARTURE OUTSIDE THE STATION STILLBURY HEAVED A COMFORTABLE SIGH
4263-20411-0039 HE WAS EVIDENTLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT NO UPHEAVALS WERE TO TAKE PLACE IN HIS DOMAIN I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THEIR ATTITUDE HE SAID AND THEY ARE QUITE RIGHT YOU KNOW THE FUNCTION OF LAW IS TO PREVENT CRIME IT IS TRUE
4263-20411-0040 BUT PROPHYLAXIS IN THE SENSE IN WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN LEGAL PRACTICE
4263-20411-0041 HOWEVER I HAD DONE ALL THAT I COULD IN THE MATTER NO FURTHER RESPONSIBILITY LAY UPON ME AND AS IT WAS PRACTICALLY CERTAIN THAT I HAD SEEN AND HEARD THE LAST OF MISTER GRAVES AND HIS MYSTERIOUS HOUSEHOLD I DISMISSED THE CASE FROM MY MIND
4263-20411-0042 THE PLETHORA OF WORK IN DOCTOR STILLBURY'S PRACTICE CONTINUED LONGER THAN I HAD BARGAINED FOR DAY AFTER DAY WENT BY AND STILL FOUND ME TRAMPING THE DINGY STREETS OF KENNINGTON OR SCRAMBLING UP AND DOWN NARROW STAIRWAYS TURNING IN AT NIGHT DEAD TIRED
4263-20411-0043 OR TURNING OUT HALF AWAKE TO THE HIDEOUS JANGLE OF THE NIGHT BELL IT WAS VERY PROVOKING FOR MONTHS I HAD RESISTED THORNDYKE'S PERSUASION TO GIVE UP GENERAL PRACTICE AND JOIN HIM NOT FROM LACK OF INCLINATION BUT FROM A DEEP SUSPICION THAT HE WAS THINKING OF MY WANTS RATHER THAN HIS OWN
4263-20411-0044 THAT HIS WAS A CHARITABLE RATHER THAN A BUSINESS PROPOSAL NOW THAT I KNEW THIS NOT TO BE THE CASE I WAS IMPATIENT TO JOIN HIM AND AS I TRUDGED THROUGH THE DREARY THOROUGHFARES OF THIS SUPERANNUATED SUBURB WITH ITS ONCE RUSTIC VILLAS AND ITS FADED GARDENS
4263-20411-0045 THE CLOSED CARRIAGE APPEARED NO MORE NOR DID ANY WHISPER EITHER OF GOOD OR EVIL REACH ME IN CONNECTION WITH THE MYSTERIOUS HOUSE FROM WHICH IT HAD COME
4263-20411-0046 ALL THE INCIDENTS OF THAT LAST NIGHT WOULD RECONSTITUTE THEMSELVES WITH A VIVIDNESS THAT SHOWED THE INTENSITY OF THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAD MADE AT THE TIME
4263-20411-0047 BUT IT CLUNG TO MY MEMORY IT HAUNTED ME AND EVER AS IT RETURNED IT BORE WITH IT THE DISQUIETING QUESTIONS WAS MISTER GRAVES STILL ALIVE AND IF HE WAS NOT WAS THERE REALLY NOTHING WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO SAVE HIM
4263-20411-0048 ONE EVENING AS WE WERE WRITING UP THE DAY BOOK STILLBURY REMARKED I ALMOST THINK JERVIS I COULD MANAGE BY MYSELF NOW
4263-20411-0049 I THINK I CAN WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE OFF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAY TO MORROW MORNING AFTER I HAVE MADE A FEW VISITS AND TRANSFERRED THE PATIENTS TO YOU
4263-20411-0050 THEN I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR CHEQUE AND SETTLE UP EVERYTHING TO NIGHT SO THAT YOU SHALL BE FREE TO GO OFF WHEN YOU LIKE TO MORROW MORNING THUS ENDED MY CONNECTION WITH KENNINGTON LANE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT ABOUT NOON
4263-20411-0051 I FOUND MYSELF STROLLING ACROSS WATERLOO BRIDGE WITH THE SENSATIONS OF A NEWLY LIBERATED CONVICT AND A CHEQUE FOR TWENTY FIVE GUINEAS IN MY POCKET MY LUGGAGE WAS TO FOLLOW WHEN I SENT FOR IT NOW UNHAMPERED EVEN BY A HAND BAG
