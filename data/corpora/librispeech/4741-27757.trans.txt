4741-27757-0000 HIS HUT WAS TEN VERSTS AWAY FROM A RAILROAD STATION IN ONE DIRECTION AND TWELVE VERSTS AWAY IN THE OTHER ABOUT FOUR VERSTS AWAY THERE WAS A COTTON MILL THAT HAD OPENED THE YEAR BEFORE
4741-27757-0001 AND ITS TALL CHIMNEY ROSE UP DARKLY FROM BEHIND THE FOREST THE ONLY DWELLINGS AROUND WERE THE DISTANT HUTS OF THE OTHER TRACK WALKERS SEMYON IVANOV'S HEALTH HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SHATTERED
4741-27757-0002 THE SUN HAD ROASTED HIM THE COLD FROZEN HIM AND HUNGER FAMISHED HIM ON THE FORCED MARCHES OF FORTY AND FIFTY VERSTS A DAY IN THE HEAT AND THE COLD AND THE RAIN AND THE SHINE

4741-27757-0005 THE BULLETS HUMMED ABOUT HIM AND RATTLED VICIOUSLY AGAINST THE ROCKS SEMYON WAS TERRIFIED AND CRIED SOMETIMES BUT STILL HE KEPT RIGHT ON THE OFFICERS WERE PLEASED WITH HIM
4741-27757-0006 BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD HOT TEA READY FOR THEM HE RETURNED FROM THE CAMPAIGN WITH LIMBS UNBROKEN BUT CRIPPLED WITH RHEUMATISM HE HAD EXPERIENCED NO LITTLE SORROW SINCE THEN
4741-27757-0007 HE ARRIVED HOME TO FIND THAT HIS FATHER AN OLD MAN AND HIS LITTLE FOUR YEAR OLD SON HAD DIED SEMYON REMAINED ALONE WITH HIS WIFE THEY COULD NOT DO MUCH
4741-27757-0008 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PLOUGH WITH RHEUMATIC ARMS AND LEGS THEY COULD NO LONGER STAY IN THEIR VILLAGE SO THEY STARTED OFF TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNE IN NEW PLACES
4741-27757-0009 BUT NOWHERE FOUND LUCK
4741-27757-0010 ONCE HE HAPPENED TO RIDE ON AN ENGINE AND AT ONE OF THE STATIONS THE FACE OF THE STATION MASTER SEEMED FAMILIAR TO HIM SEMYON LOOKED AT THE STATION MASTER AND THE STATION MASTER LOOKED AT SEMYON AND THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER
