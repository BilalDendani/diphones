5725-44938-0002 ASKS YOU TO LOOK AT THE SCARRED BACK OF HER SISTER A YOUNG GIRL WHO HAS ESCAPED WITH HER LIFE FROM THE WHIPS OF THE COSSACK SOLDIERS OR A STUDIOUS YOUNG WOMAN SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS FROM THE HULL HOUSE CLASSES BECAUSE SHE HAS RETURNED TO KIEV
5725-44938-0003 TO BE NEAR HER BROTHER WHILE HE IS IN PRISON
5725-44938-0004 OR WE ATTEND A PROTEST MEETING AGAINST THE NEWEST OUTRAGES OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT
5725-44938-0005 AND AT OUR INDIFFERENCE TO THE WASTE OF PERHAPS THE NOBLEST HUMAN MATERIAL AMONG OUR CONTEMPORARIES CERTAIN IT IS AS THE DISTINGUISHED RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONISTS HAVE COME TO CHICAGO THEY HAVE IMPRESSED ME
5725-44938-0006 AS BELONGING TO THAT NOBLE COMPANY OF MARTYRS WHO HAVE EVER AND AGAIN POURED FORTH BLOOD THAT HUMAN PROGRESS MIGHT BE ADVANCED
5725-44938-0007 AND HAVE FILLED TO OVERFLOWING CHICAGO'S LARGEST HALLS WITH AMERICAN CITIZENS DEEPLY TOUCHED BY THIS MESSAGE OF MARTYRDOM ONE SIGNIFICANT MEETING WAS ADDRESSED BY A MEMBER OF THE RUSSIAN DUMA
5725-44938-0008 AND BY ONE OF RUSSIA'S OLDEST AND SANEST REVOLUTIONISTS ANOTHER BY MADAME BRESHKOVSKY WHO LATER LANGUISHED A PRISONER IN THE FORTRESS OF SAINT PETER AND SAINT PAUL IN THIS WONDERFUL PROCESSION OF REVOLUTIONISTS PRINCE KROPOTKIN
5725-44938-0009 OR AS HE PREFERS TO BE CALLED PETER KROPOTKIN WAS DOUBTLESS THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WHEN HE CAME TO AMERICA TO LECTURE HE WAS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITH GREAT INTEREST AND RESPECT THAT HE WAS A GUEST OF HULL HOUSE DURING HIS STAY IN CHICAGO
5725-44938-0010 ATTRACTED LITTLE ATTENTION AT THE TIME BUT TWO YEARS LATER WHEN THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT MC KINLEY OCCURRED THE VISIT OF THIS KINDLY SCHOLAR WHO HAD ALWAYS CALLED HIMSELF AN ANARCHIST AND HAD CERTAINLY WRITTEN FIERY TRACTS IN HIS YOUNGER MANHOOD
5725-44938-0011 WAS MADE THE BASIS OF AN ATTACK UPON HULL HOUSE BY A DAILY NEWSPAPER
5725-44938-0012 HAD ADDRESSED THE CHICAGO ARTS AND CRAFTS SOCIETY AT HULL HOUSE
5725-44938-0013 AND BEFORE THE LEADING LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES OF CHICAGO THESE INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIETIES WERE NOT THEREFORE CALLED ANARCHISTIC
5725-44938-0014 THROUGH AN INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH THE IMPRISONMENT OF THE EDITOR ON AN ANARCHISTIC PAPER WHO WAS ARRESTED IN CHICAGO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT MC KINLEY IN THE EXCITEMENT FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL CALAMITY
5725-44938-0015 AND THE AVOWAL BY THE ASSASSIN OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE ANARCHISTIC LECTURE TO WHICH HE HAD LISTENED ARRESTS WERE MADE IN CHICAGO OF EVERY ONE SUSPECTED OF ANARCHY IN THE BELIEF THAT A WIDESPREAD PLOT WOULD BE UNCOVERED
5725-44938-0016 THE EDITOR'S HOUSE WAS SEARCHED FOR INCRIMINATING LITERATURE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER TAKEN TO A POLICE STATION AND HIS SON AND HIMSELF WITH SEVERAL OTHER SUSPECTED ANARCHISTS WERE PLACED IN THE DISUSED CELLS IN THE BASEMENT OF THE CITY HALL
5725-44938-0017 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE PUBLIC EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT AND THE UNFATHOMABLE SENSE OF HORROR
5725-44938-0018 WHICH COMPELS AN INSTINCTIVE RECOIL FROM ALL LAW ABIDING CITIZENS DOUBTLESS BOTH THE HORROR AND RECOIL HAVE THEIR ROOTS DEEP DOWN IN HUMAN EXPERIENCE THE EARLIEST FORMS OF GOVERNMENT IMPLIED A GROUP WHICH OFFERED COMPETENT RESISTANCE TO OUTSIDERS
5725-44938-0019 BUT ASSUMING NO PROTECTION WAS NECESSARY BETWEEN ANY TWO OF ITS OWN MEMBERS PROMPTLY PUNISHED WITH DEATH THE TRAITOR WHO HAD ASSAULTED ANYONE WITHIN AN ANARCHISTIC ATTACK AGAINST AN OFFICIAL THUS FURNISHES AN ACCREDITED BASIS
5725-44938-0020 BOTH FOR UNREASONING HATRED AND FOR PROMPT PUNISHMENT BOTH THE HATRED AND THE DETERMINATION TO PUNISH REACHED THE HIGHEST PITCH IN CHICAGO AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT MC KINLEY AND THE GROUP OF WRETCHED MEN DETAINED IN THE OLD FASHIONED SCARCELY HABITABLE CELLS
5725-44938-0021 HAD NOT THE LEAST IDEA OF THEIR ULTIMATE FATE THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE AN ATTORNEY AND WERE KEPT IN COMMUNICADO AS THEIR EXCITED FRIENDS CALLED IT I HAD SEEN THE EDITOR AND HIS FAMILY ONLY DURING PRINCE KROPOTKIN'S STAY AT HULL HOUSE
5725-44938-0022 THE EDITOR HAD IMPRESSED ME AS A QUIET SCHOLARLY MAN
5725-44938-0023 SOMEWHAT STARTLED BY THE RADICALISM OF HIS FIERY YOUNG SON AND MUCH COMFORTED BY THE GERMAN DOMESTICITY OF HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER PERHAPS IT WAS BUT MY HYSTERICAL SYMPTOM OF THE UNIVERSAL EXCITEMENT
5725-44938-0024 BUT IT CERTAINLY SEEMED TO ME MORE THAN I COULD BEAR WHEN A GROUP OF HIS INDIVIDUALISTIC FRIENDS WHO HAD COME TO ASK FOR HELP SAID YOU SEE WHAT BECOMES OF YOUR BOASTED LAW THE AUTHORITIES WON'T EVEN ALLOW AN ATTORNEY NOR WILL THEY ACCEPT BAIL FOR THESE MEN
5725-44938-0025 AGAINST WHOM NOTHING CAN BE PROVED ALTHOUGH THE VERIEST CRIMINALS ARE NOT DENIED SUCH A RIGHT CHALLENGED BY AN ANARCHIST ONE IS ALWAYS SENSITIVE FOR THE HONOR OF LEGALLY CONSTITUTED SOCIETY AND I REPLIED THAT OF COURSE THE MEN COULD HAVE AN ATTORNEY
5725-44938-0026 THAT THE ASSASSIN HIMSELF WOULD EVENTUALLY BE FURNISHED WITH ONE THAT THE FACT THAT A MAN WAS AN ANARCHIST HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS RIGHTS BEFORE THE LAW
5725-44938-0027 BUT THAT THE FACT STILL REMAINED THAT THESE MEN HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY ISOLATED SEEING NO ONE BUT POLICEMEN WHO CONSTANTLY FRIGHTENED THEM WITH TALES OF PUBLIC CLAMOR AND THREATENED LYNCHING THE CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE ON SATURDAY NIGHT
5725-44938-0028 AND AS THE FINAL POLICE AUTHORITY RESTS IN THE MAYOR WITH A FRIEND WHO WAS EQUALLY DISTURBED OVER THE SITUATION I REPAIRED TO HIS HOUSE ON SUNDAY MORNING TO APPEAL TO HIM IN THE INTEREST OF A LAW AND ORDER THAT SHOULD NOT YIELD TO PANIC
5725-44938-0029 WE CONTENDED THAT TO THE ANARCHIST ABOVE ALL MEN IT MUST BE DEMONSTRATED THAT LAW IS IMPARTIAL AND STANDS THE TEST OF EVERY STRAIN
5725-44938-0030 HE INSISTED HOWEVER THAT THE MEN THUS FAR HAD MERELY BEEN PROPERLY PROTECTED AGAINST LYNCHING
5725-44938-0031 HE WOULD NOT YET HOWEVER TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PERMITTING AN ATTORNEY
5725-44938-0032 HE WOULD WRITE ME A PERMIT AT ONCE I PROMPTLY FELL INTO THE TRAP IF TRAP IT WAS AND WITHIN HALF AN HOUR WAS IN A CORRIDOR IN THE CITY HALL BASEMENT TALKING TO THE DISTRACTED EDITOR AND SURROUNDED BY A CORDON OF POLICE
5725-44938-0033 WHO ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT SAFE TO PERMIT HIM OUT OF HIS CELL THE EDITOR WHO HAD GROWN THIN AND HAGGARD UNDER HIS SUSPENSE
5725-44938-0034 CONCERNING WHOM HE HAD HEARD NOT A WORD SINCE HE HAD SEEN THEM ARRESTED GRADUALLY HE BECAME COMPOSED AS HE LEARNED NOT THAT HIS TESTIMONY HAD BEEN BELIEVED TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE ASSASSIN BUT ONCE AND HAD THEN CONSIDERED HIM A FOOLISH HALF WITTED CREATURE
5725-44938-0035 BUT THAT THE MOST THOROUGHGOING DRAGNET INVESTIGATIONS ON THE PART OF THE UNITED POLICE OF THE COUNTRY
5725-44938-0036 THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION WAS SIMPLE AND DID NOT SEEM TO ME UNLIKE IN MOTIVE OR CHARACTER INTERVIEWS I HAD HAD WITH MANY ANOTHER FORLORN MAN WHO HAD FALLEN INTO PRISON I HAD SCARCE RETURNED TO HULL HOUSE HOWEVER BEFORE IT WAS FILLED WITH REPORTERS
5725-44938-0037 A PERIOD OF SHARP PUBLIC OPPROBRIUM FOLLOWED TRACES OF WHICH I SUPPOSE WILL ALWAYS REMAIN AND YET IN THE MIDST OF THE LETTERS OF PROTEST AND ACCUSATION WHICH MADE MY MAIL A HORROR EVERY MORNING
5725-44938-0038 CAME A FEW LETTERS OF ANOTHER SORT ONE FROM A FEDERAL JUDGE WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN
5725-44938-0039 ALTHOUGH ONE OR TWO ARDENT YOUNG PEOPLE RUSHED INTO PRINT TO DEFEND ME FROM THE CHARGE OF ABETTING ANARCHY
5725-44938-0040 I HAD FELT THAT THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW ITSELF EXTENDED TO THE MOST UNPOPULAR CITIZEN WAS THE ONLY REPLY TO THE ANARCHISTIC ARGUMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THIS MOMENT OF PANIC REVEALED THE TRUTH OF THEIR THEORY OF GOVERNMENT
5725-44938-0041 THAT THE CUSTODIANS OF LAW AND ORDER HAVE BECOME THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF
5725-44938-0042 THROUGH SHEER POSSESSION OF ARMS
5725-44938-0043 AT THAT MOMENT I WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT THE PUBLIC COULD ONLY BE CONVICTED OF THE BLINDNESS OF ITS COURSE WHEN A BODY OF PEOPLE WITH A HUNDRED FOLD OF THE MORAL ENERGY POSSESSED BY A SETTLEMENT GROUP
5725-44938-0044 SHOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO METHOD BY WHICH ANY COMMUNITY CAN BE GUARDED AGAINST SPORADIC EFFORTS ON THE PART OF HALF CRAZED DISCOURAGED MEN SAVE BY A SENSE OF MUTUAL RIGHTS AND SECURITIES WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE VERIEST OUTCAST
5725-44938-0045 NO ONE ADEQUATELY URGED THAT PUBLIC SPIRITED CITIZENS SET THEMSELVES THE TASK OF PATIENTLY DISCOVERING HOW THESE SPORADIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST GOVERNMENT MAY BE UNDERSTOOD AND AVERTED
5725-44938-0046 WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY OCCUR AMONG THE DISCOURAGED AND UNASSIMILATED IMMIGRANTS WHO MIGHT BE CARED FOR IN SUCH A WAY AS ENORMOUSLY TO LESSEN THE PROBABILITY OF THESE ACTS OR WHETHER THEY ARE THE RESULT OF ANARCHISTIC TEACHING
5725-44938-0047 WE MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO HEAL AND CURE THE SITUATION FAILURE TO MAKE A PROPER DIAGNOSIS MAY MEAN TREATMENT OF A DISEASE WHICH DOES NOT EXIST OR IT MAY FURTHERMORE MEAN THAT THE DIRE MALADY FROM WHICH THE PATIENT IS SUFFERING
5725-44938-0048 BE PERMITTED TO DEVELOP UNCHECKED AND YET AS THE DETAILS OF THE MEAGER LIFE OF THE PRESIDENT'S ASSASSIN WERE DISCLOSED
