3258-169291-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE RAISING MONEY WHEN WE OPENED OUR BOARDING DEPARTMENT WE PROVIDED ROOMS IN THE ATTIC OF PORTER HALL OUR FIRST BUILDING FOR A NUMBER OF GIRLS
3258-169291-0001 BUT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS OF BOTH SEXES CONTINUED TO INCREASE WE COULD FIND ROOMS OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL GROUNDS FOR MANY OF THE YOUNG MEN BUT THE GIRLS WE DID NOT CARE TO EXPOSE IN THIS WAY
3258-169291-0002 VERY SOON THE PROBLEM OF PROVIDING MORE ROOMS FOR THE GIRLS AS WELL AS A LARGER BOARDING DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THE STUDENTS GREW SERIOUS AS A RESULT WE FINALLY DECIDED TO UNDERTAKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STILL LARGER BUILDING
3258-169291-0003 A BUILDING THAT WOULD CONTAIN ROOMS FOR THE GIRLS AND BOARDING ACCOMMODATIONS FOR ALL AFTER HAVING HAD A PRELIMINARY SKETCH OF THE NEEDED BUILDING MADE WE FOUND THAT IT WOULD COST ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WE HAD NO MONEY WHATEVER WITH WHICH TO BEGIN
3258-169291-0004 STILL WE DECIDED TO GIVE THE NEEDED BUILDING A NAME WE KNEW WE COULD NAME IT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE IN DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO SECURE THE MEANS FOR ITS CONSTRUCTION WE DECIDED TO CALL THE PROPOSED BUILDING ALABAMA HALL
3258-169291-0005 IN HONOUR OF THE STATE IN WHICH WE WERE LABOURING AGAIN MISS DAVIDSON BEGAN MAKING EFFORTS TO ENLIST THE INTEREST AND HELP OF THE COLOURED AND WHITE PEOPLE IN AND NEAR TUSKEGEE THEY RESPONDED WILLINGLY IN PROPORTION TO THEIR MEANS
3258-169291-0006 THE STUDENTS AS IN THE CASE OF OUR FIRST BUILDING PORTER HALL BEGAN DIGGING OUT THE DIRT IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE LAYING OF THE FOUNDATIONS WHEN WE SEEMED AT THE END OF OUR RESOURCES SO FAR AS SECURING MONEY WAS CONCERNED
3258-169291-0007 SOMETHING OCCURRED WHICH SHOWED THE GREATNESS OF GENERAL ARMSTRONG SOMETHING WHICH PROVED HOW FAR HE WAS ABOVE THE ORDINARY INDIVIDUAL WHEN WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF GREAT ANXIETY AS TO WHERE AND HOW WE WERE TO GET FUNDS FOR THE NEW BUILDING
3258-169291-0008 I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM GENERAL ARMSTRONG ASKING ME IF I COULD SPEND A MONTH TRAVELLING WITH HIM THROUGH THE NORTH AND ASKING ME IF I COULD DO SO TO COME TO HAMPTON AT ONCE OF COURSE I ACCEPTED GENERAL ARMSTRONG'S INVITATION
3258-169291-0009 AND WENT TO HAMPTON IMMEDIATELY ON ARRIVING THERE I FOUND THAT THE GENERAL HAD DECIDED TO TAKE A QUARTETTE OF SINGERS THROUGH THE NORTH AND HOLD MEETINGS FOR A MONTH IN IMPORTANT CITIES AT WHICH MEETINGS HE AND I WERE TO SPEAK
3258-169291-0010 IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN THE GENERAL TOLD ME FURTHER THAT THESE MEETINGS WERE TO BE HELD NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF HAMPTON BUT IN THE INTERESTS OF TUSKEGEE AND THAT THE HAMPTON INSTITUTE WAS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE EXPENSES
3258-169291-0011 ALTHOUGH HE NEVER TOLD ME SO IN SO MANY WORDS I FOUND THAT GENERAL ARMSTRONG TOOK THIS METHOD OF INTRODUCING ME TO THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH AS WELL AS FOR THE SAKE OF SECURING SOME IMMEDIATE FUNDS TO BE USED IN THE ERECTION OF ALABAMA HALL
3258-169291-0012 A WEAK AND NARROW MAN WOULD HAVE REASONED THAT ALL THE MONEY WHICH CAME TO TUSKEGEE IN THIS WAY WOULD BE JUST SO MUCH TAKEN FROM THE HAMPTON INSTITUTE BUT NONE OF THESE SELFISH OR SHORT SIGHTED FEELINGS EVER ENTERED THE BREAST OF GENERAL ARMSTRONG
3258-169291-0013 HE WAS TOO BIG TO BE LITTLE TOO GOOD TO BE MEAN HE KNEW THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE NORTH WHO GAVE MONEY GAVE IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING THE WHOLE CAUSE OF NEGRO CIVILIZATION AND NOT MERELY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF ANY ONE SCHOOL
3258-169291-0014 THE GENERAL KNEW TOO THAT THE WAY TO STRENGTHEN HAMPTON WAS TO MAKE IT A CENTRE OF UNSELFISH POWER IN THE WORKING OUT OF THE WHOLE SOUTHERN PROBLEM
3258-169291-0015 I RECALL JUST ONE PIECE OF ADVICE WHICH THE GENERAL GAVE ME HE SAID GIVE THEM AN IDEA FOR EVERY WORD I THINK IT WOULD BE HARD TO IMPROVE UPON THIS ADVICE AND IT MIGHT BE MADE TO APPLY TO ALL PUBLIC SPEAKING
3258-169291-0016 FROM THAT TIME TO THE PRESENT I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO KEEP HIS ADVICE IN MIND MEETINGS WERE HELD IN NEW YORK BROOKLYN BOSTON PHILADELPHIA AND OTHER LARGE CITIES
3258-169291-0017 AND AT ALL OF THESE MEETINGS GENERAL ARMSTRONG PLEASED TOGETHER WITH MYSELF FOR HELP NOT FOR HAMPTON BUT FOR TUSKEGEE AT THESE MEETINGS AN ESPECIAL EFFORT WAS MADE TO SECURE HELP FOR THE BUILDING OF ALABAMA HALL
3258-169291-0018 AS WELL AS TO INTRODUCE THE SCHOOL TO THE ATTENTION OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN BOTH THESE RESPECTS THE MEETINGS PROVED SUCCESSFUL AFTER THAT KINDLY INTRODUCTION I BEGAN GOING NORTH ALONE TO SECURE FUNDS
3258-169291-0019 DURING THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO SPEND A LARGE PROPORTION OF MY TIME AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE MONEY TO PROVIDE FOR THE GROWING NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTION
3258-169291-0020 IN MY EFFORTS TO GET FUNDS I HAVE HAD SOME EXPERIENCES THAT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO MY READERS TIME AND TIME AGAIN I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO SECURE MONEY FOR PHILANTHROPIC PURPOSES
3258-169291-0021 WHAT RULE OR RULES I FOLLOWED TO SECURE THE INTEREST AND HELP OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY TO WORTHY OBJECTS AS FAR AS THE SCIENCE OF WHAT IS CALLED BEGGING CAN BE REDUCED TO RULES
3258-169291-0022 I WOULD SAY THAT I HAVE HAD BUT TWO RULES FIRST ALWAYS TO DO MY WHOLE DUTY REGARDING MAKING OUR WORK KNOWN TO INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS
3258-169291-0023 THIS SECOND RULE HAS BEEN THE HARDEST FOR ME TO LIVE UP TO WHEN BILLS ARE ON THE EVE OF FALLING DUE WITH NOT A DOLLAR IN HAND WITH WHICH TO MEET THEM IT IS PRETTY DIFFICULT TO LEARN NOT TO WORRY
3258-169291-0024 ALTHOUGH I THINK I AM LEARNING MORE AND MORE EACH YEAR THAT ALL WORRY SIMPLY CONSUMES AND TO NO PURPOSE JUST SO MUCH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STRENGTH THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE GIVEN TO EFFECTIVE WORK
3258-169291-0025 AFTER CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN COMING INTO CONTACT WITH WEALTHY AND NOTED MEN
3258-169291-0026 ARE THOSE WHO NEVER GROW EXCITED OR LOSE SELF CONTROL BUT ARE ALWAYS CALM SELF POSSESSED PATIENT AND POLITE I THINK THAT PRESIDENT WILLIAM MC KINLEY IS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF A MAN OF THIS CLASS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN
3258-169291-0027 IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ANY KIND OF UNDERTAKING I THINK THE MAIN THING IS FOR ONE TO GROW TO THE POINT WHERE HE COMPLETELY FORGETS HIMSELF THAT IS TO LOSE HIMSELF IN A GREAT CAUSE
3258-169291-0028 IN PROPORTION AS ONE LOSES HIMSELF IN THE WAY IN THE SAME DEGREE DOES HE GET THE HIGHEST HAPPINESS OUT OF HIS WORK MY EXPERIENCE IN GETTING MONEY FOR TUSKEGEE HAS TAUGHT ME TO HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS CONDEMNING THE RICH
3258-169291-0029 BECAUSE THEY ARE RICH AND BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GIVE MORE TO OBJECTS OF CHARITY IN THE FIRST PLACE THOSE WHO ARE GUILTY OF SUCH SWEEPING CRITICISMS DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE MADE POOR
3258-169291-0030 AND HOW MUCH SUFFERING WOULD RESULT IF WEALTHY PEOPLE WERE TO PART ALL AT ONCE WITH ANY LARGE PROPORTION OF THEIR WEALTH IN A WAY TO DISORGANIZE AND CRIPPLE GREAT BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
3258-169291-0031 THEN VERY FEW PERSONS HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FOR HELP THAT RICH PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FLOODED WITH I KNOW WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE AS MUCH AS TWENTY CALLS A DAY FOR HELP
3258-169291-0032 MORE THAN ONCE WHEN I HAVE GONE INTO THE OFFICES OF RICH MEN I HAVE FOUND HALF A DOZEN PERSONS WAITING TO SEE THEM AND ALL COME FOR THE SAME PURPOSE THAT OF SECURING MONEY AND ALL THESE CALLS IN PERSON
3258-169291-0033 TO SAY NOTHING OF THE APPLICATIONS RECEIVED THROUGH THE MAILS VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN AWAY BY PERSONS WHO NEVER PERMIT THEIR NAMES TO BE KNOWN I HAVE OFTEN HEARD PERSONS CONDEMNED FOR NOT GIVING AWAY MONEY WHO
3258-169291-0034 SO QUIETLY THAT THE WORLD KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS THERE ARE TWO LADIES IN NEW YORK WHOSE NAMES RARELY APPEAR IN PRINT BUT WHO IN A QUIET WAY HAVE GIVEN US THE MEANS WITH WHICH TO ERECT THREE LARGE
3258-169291-0035 AND IMPORTANT BUILDINGS DURING THE LAST EIGHT YEARS
3258-169291-0036 AND THEY NOT ONLY HELP TUSKEGEE BUT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP OTHER WORTHY CAUSES ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO BE THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH A GOOD MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FOR THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE
3258-169291-0037 BEGGAR MY EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT PERSISTENT ASKING OUTRIGHT FOR MONEY FROM THE RICH DOES NOT AS A RULE SECURE HELP
3258-169291-0038 I HAVE USUALLY PROCEEDED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT PERSONS WHO POSSESS SENSE ENOUGH TO EARN MONEY HAVE SENSE ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW TO GIVE IT AWAY AND THAT THE MERE MAKING KNOWN OF THE FACTS REGARDING TUSKEGEE
3258-169291-0039 AND ESPECIALLY THE FACTS REGARDING THE WORK OF THE GRADUATES HAS BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OUTRIGHT BEGGING I THINK THAT THE PRESENTATION OF FACTS ON A HIGH DIGNIFIED PLANE IS ALL THE BEGGING THAT MOST RICH PEOPLE CARE FOR
3258-169291-0040 WHILE THE WORK OF GOING FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE IS HARD DISAGREEABLE AND COSTLY IN BODILY STRENGTH
3258-169291-0041 SUCH WORK GIVES ONE A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY HUMAN NATURE IT ALSO HAS ITS COMPENSATIONS IN GIVING ONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
3258-169291-0042 TO BE MORE CORRECT I THINK I SHOULD SAY THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHEN ONE TAKES A BROAD SURVEY OF THE COUNTRY HE WILL FIND THAT THE MOST USEFUL AND INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN IT ARE THOSE WHO TAKE THE DEEPEST INTEREST
3258-169291-0043 IN INSTITUTIONS THAT EXIST FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE WORLD BETTER AT ONE TIME WHEN I WAS IN BOSTON I CALLED AT THE DOOR OF A RATHER WEALTHY LADY AND WAS ADMITTED TO THE VESTIBULE AND SENT UP MY CARD
3258-169291-0044 WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR AN ANSWER HER HUSBAND CAME IN AND ASKED ME IN THE MOST ABRUPT MANNER WHAT I WANTED WHEN I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE OBJECT OF MY CALL HE BECAME STILL MORE UNGENTLEMANLY IN HIS WORDS AND MANNER
3258-169291-0045 AND FINALLY GREW SO EXCITED THAT I LEFT THE HOUSE WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY FROM THE LADY A FEW BLOCKS FROM THAT HOUSE I CALLED TO SEE A GENTLEMAN WHO RECEIVED ME IN THE MOST CORDIAL MANNER HE WROTE ME HIS CHECK FOR A GENEROUS SUM
3258-169291-0046 I AM SO GRATEFUL TO YOU MISTER WASHINGTON FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP A GOOD CAUSE IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE A SHARE IN IT WE IN BOSTON ARE CONSTANTLY INDEBTED TO YOU FOR DOING OUR WORK
3258-169291-0047 IN THAT CITY THE DONORS SEEM TO FEEL IN A LARGE DEGREE THAT AN HONOUR IS BEING CONFERRED UPON THEM IN THEIR BEING PERMITTED TO GIVE NOWHERE ELSE HAVE I MET WITH IN SO LARGE A MEASURE THIS FINE AND CHRISTLIKE SPIRIT
3258-169291-0048 AS IN THE CITY OF BOSTON ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY NOTABLE INSTANCES OF IT OUTSIDE THAT CITY I REPEAT MY BELIEF THAT THE WORLD IS GROWING IN THE DIRECTION OF GIVING I REPEAT THAT THE MAIN RULE BY WHICH I HAVE BEEN GUIDED IN COLLECTING MONEY
3258-169291-0049 IS TO DO MY FULL DUTY IN REGARD TO GIVING PEOPLE WHO HAVE MONEY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HELP IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE TUSKEGEE SCHOOL I WALKED THE STREETS OR TRAVELLED COUNTRY ROADS IN THE NORTH FOR DAYS AND DAYS WITHOUT RECEIVING A DOLLAR
3258-169291-0050 OFTEN AS IT HAPPENED WHEN DURING THE WEEK I HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN NOT GETTING A CENT FROM THE VERY INDIVIDUALS FROM WHOM I MOST EXPECTED HELP AND WHEN I WAS ALMOST BROKEN DOWN AND DISCOURAGED
3258-169291-0051 THAT GENEROUS HELP HAS COME FROM SOME ONE WHO I HAD HAD LITTLE IDEA WOULD GIVE AT ALL I RECALL THAT ON ONE OCCASION I OBTAINED INFORMATION THAT LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT A GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED ABOUT TWO MILES OUT IN THE COUNTRY
3258-169291-0052 MIGHT BECOME INTERESTED IN OUR EFFORTS AT TUSKEGEE IF OUR CONDITIONS AND NEEDS WERE PRESENTED TO HIM ON AN UNUSUALLY COLD AND STORMY DAY I WALKED THE TWO MILES TO SEE HIM AFTER SOME DIFFICULTY I SUCCEEDED IN SECURING AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM
3258-169291-0053 HE LISTENED WITH SOME DEGREE OF INTEREST TO WHAT I HAD TO SAY BUT DID NOT GIVE ME ANYTHING I COULD NOT HELP HAVING THE FEELING THAT IN A MEASURE THE THREE HOURS THAT I HAD SPENT IN SEEING HIM HAD BEEN THROWN AWAY
3258-169291-0054 STILL I HAD FOLLOWED MY USUAL RULE OF DOING MY DUTY IF I HAD NOT SEEN HIM I SHOULD HAVE FELT UNHAPPY OVER NEGLECT OF DUTY TWO YEARS AFTER THIS VISIT A LETTER CAME TO TUSKEGEE FROM THIS MAN WHICH READ LIKE THIS
3258-169291-0055 ENCLOSED I SEND YOU A NEW YORK DRAFT FOR TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE USED IN FURTHERANCE OF YOUR WORK I HAD PLACED THIS SUM IN MY WILL FOR YOUR SCHOOL
3258-169291-0056 I RECALL WITH PLEASURE YOUR VISIT TO ME TWO YEARS AGO I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE ANY OCCURRENCE WHICH COULD HAVE GIVEN ME MORE GENUINE SATISFACTION THAN THE RECEIPT OF THIS DRAFT
3258-169291-0057 IT WAS BY FAR THE LARGEST SINGLE DONATION WHICH UP TO THAT TIME THE SCHOOL HAD EVER RECEIVED IT CAME AT A TIME WHEN AN UNUSUALLY LONG PERIOD HAD PASSED SINCE WE HAD RECEIVED ANY MONEY
3258-169291-0058 WE WERE IN GREAT DISTRESS BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDS AND THE NERVOUS STRAIN WAS TREMENDOUS IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO THINK OF ANY SITUATION THAT IS MORE TRYING ON THE NERVES THAN THAT OF CONDUCTING A LARGE INSTITUTION
3258-169291-0059 WITH HEAVY OBLIGATIONS TO MEET WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE THE MONEY IS TO COME FROM TO MEET THESE OBLIGATIONS FROM MONTH TO MONTH IN OUR CASE I FELT A DOUBLE RESPONSIBILITY AND THIS MADE THE ANXIETY ALL THE MORE INTENSE
3258-169291-0060 IF THE INSTITUTION HAD BEEN OFFICERED BY WHITE PERSONS AND HAD FAILED IT WOULD HAVE INJURED THE CAUSE OF NEGRO EDUCATION BUT I KNEW THAT THE FAILURE OF OUR INSTITUTION OFFICERED BY NEGROES WOULD NOT ONLY MEAN THE LOSS OF A SCHOOL
3258-169291-0061 BUT WOULD CAUSE PEOPLE IN A LARGE DEGREE TO LOSE FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF THE ENTIRE RACE THE RECEIPT OF THIS DRAFT FOR TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS UNDER ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES PARTIALLY LIFTED A BURDEN THAT HAD BEEN PRESSING DOWN UPON ME
3258-169291-0062 FOR DAYS FROM THE BEGINNING OF OUR WORK TO THE PRESENT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE FEELING AND LOSE NO OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS OUR TEACHERS WITH THE SAME IDEA THAT THE SCHOOL WILL ALWAYS BE SUPPORTED IN PROPORTION AS THE INSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION
3258-169291-0063 IS KEPT CLEAN AND PURE AND WHOLESOME THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW THE LATE COLLIS P HUNTINGTON THE GREAT RAILROAD MAN HE GAVE ME TWO DOLLARS FOR OUR SCHOOL THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM WHICH WAS A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE DIED
3258-169291-0064 HE GAVE ME FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TOWARD OUR ENDOWMENT FUND BETWEEN THESE TWO GIFTS THERE WERE OTHERS OF GENEROUS PROPORTIONS WHICH CAME EVERY YEAR FROM BOTH MISTER AND MISSUS HUNTINGTON
3258-169291-0065 NO IT WAS NOT LUCK IT WAS HARD WORK NOTHING EVER COMES TO ME THAT IS WORTH HAVING EXCEPT AS THE RESULT OF HARD WORK
3258-169291-0066 WHEN MISTER HUNTINGTON GAVE ME THE FIRST TWO DOLLARS I DID NOT BLAME HIM FOR NOT GIVING ME MORE BUT MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WAS GOING TO CONVINCE HIM BY TANGIBLE RESULTS THAT WE WERE WORTHY OF LARGER GIFTS
3258-169291-0067 FOR A DOZEN YEARS I MADE A STRONG EFFORT TO CONVINCE MISTER HUNTINGTON OF THE VALUE OF OUR WORK I NOTED THAT JUST IN PROPORTION AS THE USEFULNESS OF THE SCHOOL GREW HIS DONATIONS INCREASED
3258-169291-0068 NEVER DID I MEET AN INDIVIDUAL WHO TOOK A MORE KINDLY AND SYMPATHETIC INTEREST IN OUR SCHOOL THAN DID MISTER HUNTINGTON HE NOT ONLY GAVE MONEY TO US BUT TOOK TIME IN WHICH TO ADVISE ME AS A FATHER WOULD A SON
3258-169291-0069 ABOUT THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF THE SCHOOL MORE THAN ONCE I HAVE FOUND MYSELF IN SOME PRETTY TIGHT PLACES WHILE COLLECTING MONEY IN THE NORTH THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT I HAVE NEVER RELATED BUT ONCE BEFORE
3258-169291-0070 FOR THE REASON THAT I FEARED THAT PEOPLE WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT ONE MORNING I FOUND MYSELF IN PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND WITHOUT A CENT OF MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY BREAKFAST IN CROSSING THE STREET TO SEE A LADY FROM WHOM I HOPED TO GET SOME MONEY
3258-169291-0071 I FOUND A BRIGHT NEW TWENTY FIVE CENT PIECE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET TRACK I NOT ONLY HAD THIS TWENTY FIVE CENTS FOR MY BREAKFAST BUT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES I HAD A DONATION FROM THE LADY ON WHOM I HAD STARTED TO CALL
3258-169291-0072 RECTOR OF TRINITY CHURCH BOSTON TO PREACH THE COMMENCEMENT SERMON AS WE THEN HAD NO ROOM LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE ALL WHO WOULD BE PRESENT THE PLACE OF MEETING WAS UNDER A LARGE IMPROVISED ARBOUR
3258-169291-0073 BUILT PARTLY OF BRUSH AND PARTLY OF ROUGH BOARDS SOON AFTER DOCTOR DONALD HAD BEGUN SPEAKING THE RAIN CAME DOWN IN TORRENTS AND HE HAD TO STOP WHILE SOMEONE HELD AN UMBRELLA OVER HIM
3258-169291-0074 THE BOLDNESS OF WHAT I HAD DONE NEVER DAWNED UPON ME UNTIL I SAW THE PICTURE MADE BY THE RECTOR OF TRINITY CHURCH STANDING BEFORE THAT LARGE AUDIENCE UNDER AN OLD UMBRELLA WAITING FOR THE RAIN TO CEASE SO THAT HE COULD GO ON WITH HIS ADDRESS
3258-169291-0075 IT WAS NOT VERY LONG BEFORE THE RAIN CEASED AND DOCTOR DONALD FINISHED HIS SERMON AND AN EXCELLENT SERMON IT WAS TOO IN SPITE OF THE WEATHER AFTER HE HAD GONE TO HIS ROOM AND HAD GOTTEN THE WET THREADS OF HIS CLOTHES DRY
3258-169291-0076 DOCTOR DONALD VENTURED THE REMARK THAT A LARGE CHAPEL AT TUSKEGEE WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE THE NEXT DAY A LETTER CAME FROM TWO LADIES WHO WERE THEN TRAVELLING IN ITALY
3258-169291-0077 A SHORT TIME AGO WE RECEIVED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM MISTER ANDREW CARNEGIE TO BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ERECTING A NEW LIBRARY BUILDING OUR FIRST LIBRARY AND READING ROOM WERE IN A CORNER OF A SHANTY
3258-169291-0078 AND THE WHOLE THING OCCUPIED A SPACE ABOUT FIVE BY TWELVE FEET IT REQUIRED TEN YEARS OF WORK BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO SECURE MISTER CARNEGIE'S INTEREST AND HELP THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM TEN YEARS AGO HE SEEMED TO TAKE BUT LITTLE INTEREST IN OUR SCHOOL
3258-169291-0079 BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO SHOW HIM THAT WE WERE WORTHY OF HIS HELP AFTER TEN YEARS OF HARD WORK I WROTE HIM A LETTER READING AS FOLLOWS DECEMBER FIFTEENTH NINETEEN HUNDRED MISTER ANDREW CARNEGIE
3258-169291-0080 NEW YORK DEAR SIR COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST WHICH YOU MADE OF ME WHEN I SAW YOU AT YOUR RESIDENCE A FEW DAYS AGO I NOW SUBMIT IN WRITING AN APPEAL FOR A LIBRARY BUILDING FOR OUR INSTITUTION
3258-169291-0081 EIGHTY SIX OFFICERS AND INSTRUCTORS TOGETHER WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED COLOURED PEOPLE LIVING NEAR THE SCHOOL ALL OF WHOM WOULD MAKE USE OF THE LIBRARY BUILDING WE HAVE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND BOOKS PERIODICALS ET CETERA
3258-169291-0082 GIFTS FROM OUR FRIENDS BUT WE HAVE NO SUITABLE PLACE FOR THEM AND WE HAVE NO SUITABLE READING ROOM OUR GRADUATES GO TO WORK IN EVERY SECTION OF THE SOUTH
3258-169291-0083 AND WHATEVER KNOWLEDGE MIGHT BE OBTAINED IN THE LIBRARY WOULD SERVE TO ASSIST IN THE ELEVATION OF THE WHOLE NEGRO RACE SUCH A BUILDING AS WE NEED COULD BE ERECTED FOR ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ALL OF THE WORK FOR THE BUILDING SUCH AS BRICKMAKING
3258-169291-0084 BRICK MASONRY CARPENTRY BLACKSMITHING ET CETERA WOULD BE DONE BY THE STUDENTS THE MONEY WHICH YOU WOULD GIVE WOULD NOT ONLY SUPPLY THE BUILDING BUT THE ERECTION OF THE BUILDING WOULD GIVE A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THE BUILDING TRADES
3258-169291-0085 AND THE STUDENTS WOULD USE THE MONEY PAID TO THEM TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN SCHOOL
3258-169291-0086 IF YOU WISH FURTHER INFORMATION I SHALL BE GLAD TO FURNISH IT YOURS TRULY BOOKER T WASHINGTON PRINCIPAL THE NEXT MAIL BROUGHT BACK THE FOLLOWING REPLY
3258-169291-0087 I WILL BE VERY GLAD TO PAY THE BILLS FOR THE LIBRARY BUILDING AS THEY ARE INCURRED TO THE EXTENT OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I AM GLAD OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE INTEREST I HAVE IN YOUR NOBLE WORK
3258-169291-0088 I HAVE FOUND THAT STRICT BUSINESS METHODS GO A LONG WAY IN SECURING THE INTEREST OF RICH PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN MY CONSTANT AIM AT TUSKEGEE TO CARRY OUT IN OUR FINANCIAL AND OTHER OPERATIONS
3258-169291-0089 SUCH BUSINESS METHODS AS WOULD BE APPROVED OF BY ANY NEW YORK BANKING HOUSE I HAVE SPOKEN OF SEVERAL LARGE GIFTS TO THE SCHOOL BUT BY FAR THE GREATER PROPORTION OF THE MONEY THAT HAS BUILT UP THE INSTITUTION
3258-169291-0090 HAS COME IN THE FORM OF SMALL DONATIONS FROM PERSONS OF MODERATE MEANS
3258-169291-0091 IN MY EFFORTS TO GET MONEY I HAVE OFTEN BEEN SURPRISED AT THE PATIENCE AND DEEP INTEREST OF THE MINISTERS WHO ARE BESIEGED ON EVERY HAND AND AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY FOR HELP IF NO OTHER CONSIDERATION HAD CONVINCED ME OF THE VALUE OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
3258-169291-0092 FOR THE ELEVATION OF THE BLACK MAN WOULD HAVE MADE ME A CHRISTIAN IN A LARGE DEGREE IT HAS BEEN THE PENNIES THE NICKELS AND THE DIMES WHICH HAVE COME FROM THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOUR SOCIETIES
3258-169291-0093 AND THE MISSIONARY SOCIETIES AS WELL AS FROM THE CHURCH PROPER THAT HAVE HELPED TO ELEVATE THE NEGRO AT SO RAPID A RATE
3258-169291-0094 THIS SPEAKING OF SMALL GIFTS REMINDS ME TO SAY THAT VERY FEW TUSKEGEE GRADUATES FAIL TO SEND US AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION THESE CONTRIBUTIONS RANGE FROM TWENTY FIVE CENTS UP TO TEN DOLLARS
3258-169291-0095 AND UP TO THE PRESENT TIME WE HAVE CONTINUED TO RECEIVE HELP FROM THEM FIRST THE STATE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA INCREASED ITS ANNUAL APPROPRIATION FROM TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
3258-169291-0096 THE EFFORT TO SECURE THIS INCREASE WAS LED BY THE HON M F FOSTER THE MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM TUSKEGEE SECOND WE RECEIVED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE JOHN F SLATER FUND
3258-169291-0097 OUR WORK SEEMED TO PLEASE THE TRUSTEES OF THIS FUND AS THEY SOON BEGAN INCREASING THEIR ANNUAL GRANT THIS HAS BEEN ADDED TO FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL AT PRESENT WE RECEIVE ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM THE FUND
3258-169291-0098 THE OTHER HELP TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED CAME IN THE SHAPE OF AN ALLOWANCE FROM THE PEABODY FUND THIS WAS AT FIRST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT IT HAS SINCE BEEN INCREASED TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
3258-169291-0099 THE EFFORT TO SECURE HELP FROM THE SLATER AND PEABODY FUNDS BROUGHT ME INTO CONTACT WITH TWO RARE MEN MEN WHO HAVE HAD MUCH TO DO IN SHAPING THE POLICY FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO
3258-169291-0100 I REFER TO THE HON J L M CURRY OF WASHINGTON WHO IS THE GENERAL AGENT FOR THESE TWO FUNDS AND MISTER MORRIS K JESSUP OF NEW YORK DOCTOR CURRY IS A NATIVE OF THE SOUTH AN EX CONFEDERATE SOLDIER
3258-169291-0101 YET I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY MAN IN THE COUNTRY WHO IS MORE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE HIGHEST WELFARE OF THE NEGRO THAN DOCTOR CURRY OR ONE WHO IS MORE FREE FROM RACE PREJUDICE
3258-169291-0102 OF THE BLACK MAN AND THE SOUTHERN WHITE MAN I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM IT WAS IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA WHERE HE WAS THEN LIVING I HAD HEARD MUCH ABOUT HIM WHEN I FIRST WENT INTO HIS PRESENCE
3258-169291-0103 TREMBLING BECAUSE OF MY YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE HE TOOK ME BY THE HAND SO CORDIALLY AND SPOKE SUCH ENCOURAGING WORDS AND GAVE ME SUCH HELPFUL ADVICE REGARDING THE PROPER COURSE TO PURSUE THAT I CAME TO KNOW HIM THEN
3258-169291-0104 AS I HAVE KNOWN HIM EVER SINCE AS A HIGH EXAMPLE OF ONE WHO IS CONSTANTLY AND UNSELFISHLY AT WORK FOR THE BETTERMENT OF HUMANITY
