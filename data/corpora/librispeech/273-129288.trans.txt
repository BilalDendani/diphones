273-129288-0000 WHICH MANY PEOPLE A GOOD DEAL OLDER THAN HE WILL BE AT NO LOSS TO UNDERSTAND AN UNFINISHED COFFIN ON BLACK TRESSELS WHICH STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP LOOKED SO GLOOMY AND DEATH LIKE
273-129288-0001 THAT A COLD TREMBLE CAME OVER HIM EVERY TIME HIS EYES WANDERED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DISMAL OBJECT FROM WHICH HE ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE SOME FRIGHTFUL FORM SLOWLY REAR ITS HEAD TO DRIVE HIM MAD WITH TERROR
273-129288-0002 AGAINST THE WALL WERE RANGED IN REGULAR ARRAY A LONG ROW OF ELM BOARDS CUT IN THE SAME SHAPE LOOKING IN THE DIM LIGHT LIKE HIGH SHOULDERED GHOSTS WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR BREECHES POCKETS
273-129288-0003 COFFIN PLATES ELM CHIPS BRIGHT HEADED NAILS AND SHREDS OF BLACK CLOTH LAY SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR AND THE WALL BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS ORNAMENTED WITH A LIVELY REPRESENTATION OF TWO MUTES
273-129288-0004 IN VERY STIFF NECKCLOTHS ON DUTY AT A LARGE PRIVATE DOOR WITH A HEARSE DRAWN BY FOUR BLACK STEEDS APPROACHING IN THE DISTANCE THE SHOP WAS CLOSE AND HOT
273-129288-0005 THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TAINTED WITH THE SMELL OF COFFINS THE RECESS BENEATH THE COUNTER IN WHICH HIS FLOCK MATTRESS WAS THRUST LOOKED LIKE A GRAVE NOR WERE THESE THE ONLY DISMAL FEELINGS WHICH DEPRESSED OLIVER
273-129288-0006 HE WAS ALONE IN A STRANGE PLACE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW CHILLED AND DESOLATE THE BEST OF US WILL SOMETIMES FEEL IN SUCH A SITUATION THE BOY HAD NO FRIENDS TO CARE FOR OR TO CARE FOR HIM
273-129288-0007 THE REGRET OF NO RECENT SEPARATION WAS FRESH IN HIS MIND THE ABSENCE OF NO LOVED AND WELL REMEMBERED FACE SANK HEAVILY INTO HIS HEART BUT HIS HEART WAS HEAVY NOTWITHSTANDING
273-129288-0008 AND HE WISHED AS HE CREPT INTO HIS NARROW BED THAT THAT WERE HIS COFFIN AND THAT HE COULD BE LAIN IN A CALM AND LASTING SLEEP IN THE CHURCHYARD GROUND WITH THE TALL GRASS WAVING GENTLY ABOVE HIS HEAD
273-129288-0009 AND THE SOUND OF THE OLD DEEP BELL TO SOOTHE HIM IN HIS SLEEP OLIVER WAS AWAKENED IN THE MORNING BY A LOUD KICKING AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHOP DOOR WHICH BEFORE HE COULD HUDDLE ON HIS CLOTHES WAS REPEATED
273-129288-0010 IN AN ANGRY AND IMPETUOUS MANNER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TIMES WHEN HE BEGAN TO UNDO THE CHAIN THE LEGS DESISTED AND A VOICE BEGAN OPEN THE DOOR WILL YER
273-129288-0011 I WILL DIRECTLY SIR REPLIED OLIVER UNDOING THE CHAIN AND TURNING THE KEY I SUPPOSE YER THE NEW BOY AIN'T YER SAID THE VOICE THROUGH THE KEY HOLE YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER HOW OLD ARE YER INQUIRED THE VOICE
273-129288-0012 OLIVER HAD BEEN TOO OFTEN SUBJECTED TO THE PROCESS TO WHICH THE VERY EXPRESSIVE MONOSYLLABLE JUST RECORDED BEARS REFERENCE TO ENTERTAIN THE SMALLEST DOUBT THAT THE OWNER OF THE VOICE WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE
273-129288-0013 WOULD REDEEM HIS PLEDGE MOST HONOURABLY HE DREW BACK THE BOLTS WITH A TREMBLING HAND AND OPENED THE DOOR FOR A SECOND OR TWO OLIVER GLANCED UP THE STREET AND DOWN THE STREET AND OVER THE WAY
273-129288-0014 IMPRESSED WITH THE BELIEF THAT THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM THROUGH THE KEY HOLE HAD WALKED A FEW PACES OFF TO WARM HIMSELF FOR NOBODY DID HE SEE BUT A BIG CHARITY BOY SITTING ON A POST IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE EATING A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER
273-129288-0015 WHICH HE CUT INTO WEDGES THE SIZE OF HIS MOUTH WITH A CLASP KNIFE AND THEN CONSUMED WITH GREAT DEXTERITY I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID OLIVER AT LENGTH
273-129288-0016 DID YOU KNOCK I KICKED REPLIED THE CHARITY BOY DID YOU WANT A COFFIN SIR INQUIRED OLIVER INNOCENTLY
273-129288-0017 AT THIS THE CHARITY BOY LOOKED MONSTROUS FIERCE AND SAID THAT OLIVER WOULD WANT ONE BEFORE LONG IF HE CUT JOKES WITH HIS SUPERIORS IN THAT WAY YER DON'T KNOW WHO I AM I SUPPOSE WORK'US SAID THE CHARITY BOY IN CONTINUATION
273-129288-0018 DESCENDING FROM THE TOP OF THE POST MEANWHILE WITH EDIFYING GRAVITY NO SIR REJOINED OLIVER I'M MISTER NOAH CLAYPOLE SAID THE CHARITY BOY AND YOU'RE UNDER ME TAKE DOWN THE SHUTTERS YER IDLE YOUNG RUFFIAN
273-129288-0019 WITH THIS MISTER CLAYPOLE ADMINISTERED A KICK TO OLIVER AND ENTERED THE SHOP WITH A DIGNIFIED AIR WHICH DID HIM GREAT CREDIT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A LARGE HEADED SMALL EYED YOUTH OF LUMBERING MAKE AND HEAVY COUNTENANCE
273-129288-0020 TO LOOK DIGNIFIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT IS MORE ESPECIALLY SO WHEN SUPERADDED TO THESE PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS ARE A RED NOSE AND YELLOW SMALLS
273-129288-0021 OLIVER HAVING TAKEN DOWN THE SHUTTERS AND BROKEN A PANE OF GLASS IN HIS EFFORT TO STAGGER AWAY BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF THE FIRST ONE TO A SMALL COURT AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE KEPT DURING THE DAY WAS GRACIOUSLY ASSISTED BY NOAH
273-129288-0022 WHO HAVING CONSOLED HIM WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HE'D CATCH IT CONDESCENDED TO HELP HIM MISTER SOWERBERRY CAME DOWN SOON AFTER SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MISSUS SOWERBERRY APPEARED OLIVER HAVING CAUGHT IT IN FULFILMENT OF NOAH'S PREDICTION
273-129288-0023 FOLLOWED THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN DOWN THE STAIRS TO BREAKFAST COME NEAR THE FIRE NOAH SAID CHARLOTTE I SAVED A NICE LITTLE BIT OF BACON FOR YOU FROM MASTER'S BREAKFAST OLIVER SHUT THAT DOOR AT MISTER NOAH'S BACK
273-129288-0024 D'YE HEAR WORK'US SAID NOAH CLAYPOLE
273-129288-0025 DON'T YOU LET THE BOY ALONE LET HIM ALONE SAID NOAH
273-129288-0026 ALL HIS RELATIONS LET HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY PRETTY WELL EH CHARLOTTE HE HE HE OH YOU QUEER SOUL SAID CHARLOTTE BURSTING INTO A HEARTY LAUGH IN WHICH SHE WAS JOINED BY NOAH AFTER WHICH THEY BOTH LOOKED SCORNFULLY AT POOR OLIVER TWIST
273-129288-0027 AS HE SAT SHIVERING ON THE BOX IN THE COLDEST CORNER OF THE ROOM AND ATE THE STALE PIECES WHICH HAD BEEN SPECIALLY RESERVED FOR HIM
273-129288-0028 NO CHANCE CHILD WAS HE FOR HE COULD TRACE HIS GENEALOGY ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIS PARENTS WHO LIVED HARD BY HIS MOTHER BEING A WASHERWOMAN AND HIS FATHER A DRUNKEN SOLDIER DISCHARGED WITH A WOODEN LEG AND A DIURNAL PENSION OF TWOPENCE HALFPENNY AND AN UNSTATEABLE FRACTION
273-129288-0029 THE SHOP BOYS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD LONG BEEN IN THE HABIT OF BRANDING NOAH IN THE PUBLIC STREETS WITH THE IGNOMINIOUS EPITHETS OF LEATHERS CHARITY AND THE LIKE AND NOAH HAD BOURNE THEM WITHOUT REPLY
273-129288-0030 BUT NOW THAT FORTUNE HAD CAST IN HIS WAY A NAMELESS ORPHAN AT WHOM EVEN THE MEANEST COULD POINT THE FINGER OF SCORN HE RETORTED ON HIM WITH INTEREST THIS AFFORDS CHARMING FOOD FOR CONTEMPLATION IT SHOWS US WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING HUMAN NATURE MAY BE MADE TO BE
273-129288-0031 AND HOW IMPARTIALLY THE SAME AMIABLE QUALITIES ARE DEVELOPED IN THE FINEST LORD AND THE DIRTIEST CHARITY BOY OLIVER HAD BEEN SOJOURNING AT THE UNDERTAKER'S SOME THREE WEEKS OR A MONTH MISTER AND MISSUS SOWERBERRY THE SHOP BEING SHUT UP
273-129288-0032 WERE TAKING THEIR SUPPER IN THE LITTLE BACK PARLOUR WHEN MISTER SOWERBERRY AFTER SEVERAL DEFERENTIAL GLANCES AT HIS WIFE SAID MY DEAR HE WAS GOING TO SAY MORE BUT MISSUS SOWERBERRY LOOKING UP WITH A PECULIARLY UNPROPITIOUS ASPECT
273-129288-0033 HE STOPPED SHORT WELL SAID MISSUS SOWERBERRY SHARPLY NOTHING MY DEAR NOTHING SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY UGH YOU BRUTE SAID MISSUS SOWERBERRY
273-129288-0034 NOT AT ALL MY DEAR SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY HUMBLY I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR MY DEAR I WAS ONLY GOING TO SAY OH DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY INTERPOSED MISSUS SOWERBERRY I AM NOBODY DON'T CONSULT ME PRAY
273-129288-0035 AS MISSUS SOWERBERRY SAID THIS SHE GAVE AN HYSTERICAL LAUGH WHICH THREATENED VIOLENT CONSEQUENCES BUT MY DEAR SAID SOWERBERRY I WANT TO ASK YOUR ADVICE NO NO DON'T ASK MINE
273-129288-0036 REPLIED MISSUS SOWERBERRY IN AN AFFECTING MANNER ASK SOMEBODY ELSE'S HERE THERE WAS ANOTHER HYSTERICAL LAUGH WHICH FRIGHTENED MISTER SOWERBERRY VERY MUCH THIS IS A VERY COMMON AND MUCH APPROVED MATRIMONIAL COURSE OF TREATMENT WHICH IS OFTEN VERY EFFECTIVE
273-129288-0037 IT AT ONCE REDUCED MISTER SOWERBERRY TO BEGGING AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT MISSUS SOWERBERRY WAS MOST CURIOUS TO HEAR AFTER A SHORT DURATION THE PERMISSION WAS MOST GRACIOUSLY CONCEDED
273-129288-0038 IT'S ONLY ABOUT YOUNG TWIST MY DEAR SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY A VERY GOOD LOOKING BOY THAT MY DEAR HE NEED BE FOR HE EATS ENOUGH OBSERVED THE LADY THERE'S AN EXPRESSION OF MELANCHOLY IN HIS FACE MY DEAR
273-129288-0039 RESUMED MISTER SOWERBERRY WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING HE WOULD MAKE A DELIGHTFUL MUTE MY LOVE MISSUS SOWERBERRY LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONSIDERABLE WONDERMENT
273-129288-0040 AND WITHOUT ALLOWING TIME FOR ANY OBSERVATION ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART PROCEEDED I DON'T MEAN A REGULAR MUTE TO ATTEND GROWN UP PEOPLE MY DEAR BUT ONLY FOR CHILDREN'S PRACTICE IT WOULD BE VERY NEW TO HAVE A MUTE IN PROPORTION MY DEAR
273-129288-0041 MISSUS SOWERBERRY WHO HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TASTE IN THE UNDERTAKING WAY WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE NOVELTY OF THIS IDEA
273-129288-0042 UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES SHE MERELY INQUIRED WITH MUCH SHARPNESS WHY SUCH AN OBVIOUS SUGGESTION HAD NOT PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER HUSBAND'S MIND BEFORE MISTER SOWERBERRY RIGHTLY CONSTRUED THIS AS AN ACQUIESCENCE IN HIS PROPOSITION
273-129288-0043 IT WAS SPEEDILY DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT OLIVER SHOULD BE AT ONCE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE TRADE AND WITH THIS VIEW THAT HE SHOULD ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER ON THE VERY NEXT OCCASION OF HIS SERVICES BEING REQUIRED
273-129288-0044 THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG IN COMING HALF AN HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING MISTER BUMBLE ENTERED THE SHOP AND SUPPORTING HIS CANE AGAINST THE COUNTER DREW FORTH HIS LARGE LEATHERN POCKET BOOK
273-129288-0045 FROM WHICH HE SELECTED A SMALL SCRAP OF PAPER WHICH HE HANDED OVER TO SOWERBERRY AHA SAID THE UNDERTAKER GLANCING OVER IT WITH A LIVELY COUNTENANCE
273-129288-0046 FOR A COFFIN FIRST AND A POROCHIAL FUNERAL AFTERWARDS REPLIED MISTER BUMBLE FASTENING THE STRAP OF THE LEATHERN POCKET BOOK
273-129288-0047 BUMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE REPLIED OBSTINATE PEOPLE MISTER SOWERBERRY VERY OBSTINATE PROUD TOO I'M AFRAID SIR
273-129288-0048 COME THAT'S TOO MUCH OH IT'S SICKENING REPLIED THE BEADLE ANTIMONIAL MISTER SOWERBERRY SO IT IS ACQUIESCED THE UNDERTAKER WE ONLY HEARD OF THE FAMILY THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST SAID THE BEADLE
273-129288-0049 AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT THEM THEN ONLY A WOMAN WHO LODGES IN THE SAME HOUSE MADE AN APPLICATION TO THE POROCHIAL COMMITTEE FOR THEM TO SEND THE POROCHIAL SURGEON TO SEE A WOMAN AS WAS VERY BAD HE HAD GONE OUT TO DINNER
273-129288-0050 BUT HIS PRENTICE WHICH IS A VERY CLEVER LAD SENT EM SOME MEDICINE IN A BLACKING BOTTLE OFFHAND AH THERE'S PROMPTNESS SAID THE UNDERTAKER PROMPTNESS INDEED REPLIED THE BEADLE
273-129288-0051 BUT WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE WHAT'S THE UNGRATEFUL BEHAVIOUR OF THESE REBELS SIR WHY THE HUSBAND SENDS BACK WORD THAT THE MEDICINE WON'T SUIT HIS WIFE'S COMPLAINT AND SO SHE SHAN'T TAKE IT
273-129288-0052 SAYS SHE SHAN'T TAKE IT SIR GOOD STRONG WHOLESOME MEDICINE AS WAS GIVEN WITH GREAT SUCCESS TO TWO IRISH LABOURERS AND A COAL HEAVER
273-129288-0053 AS THE ATROCITY PRESENTED ITSELF TO MISTER BUMBLE'S MIND IN FULL FORCE HE STRUCK THE COUNTER SHARPLY WITH HIS CANE AND BECAME FLUSHED WITH INDIGNATION WELL
273-129288-0054 NEVER DID SIR EJACULATED THE BEADLE NO NOR NOBODY NEVER DID BUT NOW SHE'S DEAD WE'VE GOT TO BURY HER AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION AND THE SOONER IT'S DONE THE BETTER
273-129288-0055 AND FLOUNCED OUT OF THE SHOP WHY HE WAS SO ANGRY OLIVER THAT HE FORGOT EVEN TO ASK AFTER YOU SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY LOOKING AFTER THE BEADLE AS HE STRODE DOWN THE STREET YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER WHO HAD CAREFULLY KEPT HIMSELF OUT OF SIGHT
273-129288-0056 UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE SHOULD BE FIRMLY BOUND FOR SEVEN YEARS AND ALL DANGER OF HIS BEING RETURNED UPON THE HANDS OF THE PARISH SHOULD BE THUS EFFECTUALLY AND LEGALLY OVERCOME WELL SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY TAKING UP HIS HAT
273-129288-0057 THE SOONER THIS JOB IS DONE THE BETTER NOAH LOOK AFTER THE SHOP OLIVER PUT ON YOUR CAP AND COME WITH ME OLIVER OBEYED AND FOLLOWED HIS MASTER ON HIS PROFESSIONAL MISSION
273-129288-0058 THEY WALKED ON FOR SOME TIME THROUGH THE MOST CROWDED AND DENSELY INHABITED PART OF THE TOWN AND THEN STRIKING DOWN A NARROW STREET MORE DIRTY AND MISERABLE THAN ANY THEY HAD YET PASSED THROUGH PAUSED TO LOOK FOR THE HOUSE WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF THEIR SEARCH
273-129288-0059 AS THEIR NEGLECTED APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENTLY DENOTED WITHOUT THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY AFFORDED BY THE SQUALID LOOKS OF THE FEW MEN AND WOMEN WHO WITH FOLDED ARMS AND BODIES HALF DOUBLED OCCASIONALLY SKULKED ALONG
273-129288-0060 A GREAT MANY OF THE TENEMENTS HAD SHOP FRONTS BUT THESE WERE FAST CLOSED AND MOULDERING AWAY
273-129288-0061 SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS THE NIGHTLY HAUNTS OF SOME HOUSELESS WRETCHES FOR MANY OF THE ROUGH BOARDS WHICH SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF DOOR AND WINDOW WERE WRENCHED FROM THEIR POSITIONS TO AFFORD AN APERTURE WIDE ENOUGH
273-129288-0062 FOR THE PASSAGE OF A HUMAN BODY THE KENNEL WAS STAGNANT AND FILTHY THE VERY RATS WHICH HERE AND THERE LAY PUTREFYING IN ITS ROTTENNESS WERE HIDEOUS WITH FAMINE
273-129288-0063 SO GROPING HIS WAY CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE DARK PASSAGE AND BIDDING OLIVER KEEP CLOSE TO HIM AND NOT BE AFRAID THE UNDERTAKER MOUNTED TO THE TOP OF THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS STUMBLING AGAINST A DOOR ON THE LANDING HE RAPPED AT IT WITH HIS KNUCKLES
273-129288-0064 IT WAS OPENED BY A YOUNG GIRL OF THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN THE UNDERTAKER AT ONCE SAW ENOUGH OF WHAT THE ROOM CONTAINED TO KNOW IT WAS THE APARTMENT TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED HE STEPPED IN OLIVER FOLLOWED HIM
273-129288-0065 THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THE ROOM BUT A MAN WAS CROUCHING MECHANICALLY OVER THE EMPTY STOVE AN OLD WOMAN TOO HAD DRAWN A LOW STOOL TO THE COLD HEARTH AND WAS SITTING BESIDE HIM THERE WERE SOME RAGGED CHILDREN IN ANOTHER CORNER
273-129288-0066 AND IN A SMALL RECESS OPPOSITE THE DOOR THERE LAY UPON THE GROUND SOMETHING COVERED WITH AN OLD BLANKET OLIVER SHUDDERED AS HE CAST HIS EYES TOWARD THE PLACE AND CREPT INVOLUNTARILY CLOSER TO HIS MASTER
273-129288-0067 FOR THOUGH IT WAS COVERED UP THE BOY FELT THAT IT WAS A CORPSE THE MAN'S FACE WAS THIN AND VERY PALE HIS HAIR AND BEARD WERE GRIZZLY HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT
273-129288-0068 THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE WAS WRINKLED HER TWO REMAINING TEETH PROTRUDED OVER HER UNDER LIP AND HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND PIERCING OLIVER WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT EITHER HER OR THE MAN
273-129288-0069 THEY SEEMED SO LIKE THE RATS HE HAD SEEN OUTSIDE
273-129288-0070 KEEP BACK DAMN YOU KEEP BACK IF YOU'VE A LIFE TO LOSE NONSENSE MY GOOD MAN SAID THE UNDERTAKER WHO WAS PRETTY WELL USED TO MISERY IN ALL ITS SHAPES NONSENSE
273-129288-0071 CLENCHING HIS HANDS AND STAMPING FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR
273-129288-0072 THE UNDERTAKER OFFERED NO REPLY TO THIS RAVING
273-129288-0073 KNEEL DOWN KNEEL DOWN KNEEL ROUND HER EVERY ONE OF YOU AND MARK MY WORDS I SAY SHE WAS STARVED TO DEATH I NEVER KNEW HOW BAD SHE WAS TILL THE FEVER CAME UPON HER
273-129288-0074 AND THEN HER BONES WERE STARTING THROUGH THE SKIN THERE WAS NEITHER FIRE NOR CANDLE SHE DIED IN THE DARK IN THE DARK
273-129288-0075 SHE COULDN'T EVEN SEE HER CHILDREN'S FACES THOUGH WE HEARD HER GASPING OUT THEIR NAMES
273-129288-0076 HE TWINED HIS HANDS IN HIS HAIR AND WITH A LOUD SCREAM ROLLED GROVELLING UPON THE FLOOR HIS EYES FIXED AND THE FOAM COVERING HIS LIPS
273-129288-0077 THE TERRIFIED CHILDREN CRIED BITTERLY BUT THE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD HITHERTO REMAINED AS QUIET AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WHOLLY DEAF TO ALL THAT PASSED MENACED THEM INTO SILENCE
273-129288-0078 HAVING UNLOOSENED THE CRAVAT OF THE MAN WHO STILL REMAINED EXTENDED ON THE GROUND SHE TOTTERED TOWARDS THE UNDERTAKER SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER SAID THE OLD WOMAN
273-129288-0079 NODDING HER HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CORPSE AND SPEAKING WITH AN IDIOTIC LEER MORE GHASTLY THAN EVEN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH IN SUCH A PLACE LORD
273-129288-0080 LORD WELL IT IS STRANGE THAT I WHO GAVE BIRTH TO HER AND WAS A WOMAN THEN SHOULD BE ALIVE AND MERRY NOW AND SHE LYING THERE SO COLD AND STIFF
273-129288-0081 LORD LORD TO THINK OF IT IT'S AS GOOD AS A PLAY
273-129288-0082 THE UNDERTAKER TURNED TO GO AWAY STOP STOP SAID THE OLD WOMAN IN A LOUD WHISPER WILL SHE BE BURIED TO MORROW OR NEXT DAY OR TO NIGHT
273-129288-0083 I LAID HER OUT AND I MUST WALK
273-129288-0084 SEND ME A LARGE CLOAK A GOOD WARM ONE FOR IT IS BITTER COLD WE SHOULD HAVE CAKE AND WINE TOO BEFORE WE GO NEVER MIND SEND SOME BREAD
273-129288-0085 ONLY A LOAF OF BREAD AND A CUP OF WATER SHALL WE HAVE SOME BREAD DEAR SHE SAID EAGERLY CATCHING AT THE UNDERTAKER'S COAT AS HE ONCE MORE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR
273-129288-0086 HE DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE OLD WOMAN'S GRASP AND DRAWING OLIVER AFTER HIM HURRIED AWAY THE NEXT DAY THE FAMILY HAVING BEEN MEANWHILE RELIEVED WITH A HALF QUARTERN LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE LEFT WITH THEM BY MISTER BUMBLE HIMSELF
273-129288-0087 OLIVER AND HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE MISERABLE ABODE WHERE MISTER BUMBLE HAD ALREADY ARRIVED ACCOMPANIED BY FOUR MEN FROM THE WORKHOUSE WHO WERE TO ACT AS BEARERS AN OLD BLACK CLOAK HAD BEEN THROWN OVER THE RAGS OF THE OLD WOMAN AND THE MAN
273-129288-0088 AND THE BARE COFFIN HAVING BEEN SCREWED DOWN WAS HOISTED ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE BEARERS AND CARRIED INTO THE STREET NOW YOU MUST PUT YOUR BEST LEG FOREMOST OLD LADY
273-129288-0089 WE ARE RATHER LATE AND IT WON'T DO TO KEEP THE CLERGYMAN WAITING MOVE ON MY MEN AS QUICK AS YOU LIKE
273-129288-0090 AND THE TWO MOURNERS KEPT AS NEAR THEM AS THEY COULD MISTER BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY WALKED AT A GOOD SMART PACE IN FRONT AND OLIVER WHOSE LEGS WERE NOT SO LONG AS HIS MASTER'S RAN BY THE SIDE
273-129288-0091 THERE WAS NOT SO GREAT A NECESSITY FOR HURRYING AS MISTER SOWERBERRY HAD ANTICIPATED HOWEVER FOR WHEN THEY REACHED THE OBSCURE CORNER OF THE CHURCHYARD IN WHICH THE NETTLES GREW AND WHERE THE PARISH GRAVES WERE MADE
273-129288-0092 THE CLERGYMAN HAD NOT ARRIVED AND THE CLERK WHO WAS SITTING BY THE VESTRY ROOM FIRE SEEMED TO THINK IT BY NO MEANS IMPROBABLE THAT IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE HE CAME SO THEY PUT THE BIER ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE
273-129288-0093 AND THE TWO MOURNERS WAITED PATIENTLY IN THE DAMP CLAY WITH A COLD RAIN DRIZZLING DOWN WHILE THE RAGGED BOYS WHOM THE SPECTACLE HAD ATTRACTED INTO THE CHURCHYARD PLAYED A NOISY GAME AT HIDE AND SEEK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES
273-129288-0094 OR VARIED THEIR AMUSEMENTS BY JUMPING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS OVER THE COFFIN MISTER SOWERBERRY AND BUMBLE BEING PERSONAL FRIENDS OF THE CLERK SAT BY THE FIRE WITH HIM AND READ THE PAPER
273-129288-0095 AT LENGTH AFTER A LAPSE OF SOMETHING MORE THAN AN HOUR MISTER BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY AND THE CLERK WERE SEEN RUNNING TOWARDS THE GRAVE
273-129288-0096 AND THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN HAVING READ AS MUCH OF THE BURIAL SERVICE AS COULD BE COMPRESSED INTO FOUR MINUTES GAVE HIS SURPLICE TO THE CLERK AND WALKED AWAY AGAIN NOW BILL SAID SOWERBERRY TO THE GRAVE DIGGER FILL UP IT WAS NO VERY
273-129288-0097 DIFFICULT TASK FOR THE GRAVE WAS SO FULL THAT THE UPPERMOST COFFIN WAS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SURFACE
273-129288-0098 SHOULDERED HIS SPADE AND WALKED OFF FOLLOWED BY THE BOYS WHO MURMURED VERY LOUD COMPLAINTS AT THE FUN BEING OVER SO SOON COME MY GOOD FELLOW SAID BUMBLE TAPPING THE MAN ON THE BACK THEY WANT TO SHUT UP THE YARD
273-129288-0099 THE MAN WHO HAD NEVER ONCE MOVED SINCE HE HAD TAKEN HIS STATION BY THE GRAVE SIDE STARTED RAISED HIS HEAD STARED AT THE PERSON WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM
273-129288-0100 THE CRAZY OLD WOMAN WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN BEWAILING THE LOSS OF HER CLOAK WHICH THE UNDERTAKER HAD TAKEN OFF TO PAY HIM ANY ATTENTION SO THEY THREW A CAN OF COLD WATER OVER HIM AND WHEN HE CAME TO
273-129288-0101 SAW HIM SAFELY OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD LOCKED THE GATE AND DEPARTED ON THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS WELL OLIVER SAID SOWERBERRY AS THEY WALKED HOME HOW DO YOU LIKE IT PRETTY WELL THANK YOU SIR
273-129288-0102 REPLIED OLIVER WITH CONSIDERABLE HESITATION NOT VERY MUCH SIR
273-129288-0103 NOTHING WHEN YOU ARE USED TO IT MY BOY OLIVER WONDERED IN HIS OWN MIND WHETHER IT HAD TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME TO GET MISTER SOWERBERRY USED TO IT
