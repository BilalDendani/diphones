6882-79969-0029 AND AT THE SAME MOMENT FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATE BUT THE SENTRY WOULD NOT LET HIM IN BECAUSE HIS CLOTHES THOUGH OF RICH MATERIAL
6882-79969-0030 WHERE A SHEPHERD LIVED AND EXCHANGING CLOTHING WITH HIM PUT ON HIS OLD SMOCK AND PASSED INTO THE TOWN UNNOTICED WHEN HE REACHED HIS FATHER HE BEGAN MAKING HIMSELF KNOWN BUT HIS FATHER NEVER THINKING THAT IT WAS HIS SON
6882-79969-0031 SAID THAT IT WAS TRUE HE HAD ONCE HAD A SON BUT HE HAD LONG BEEN DEAD BUT HE ADDED SEEING THAT HE WAS A POOR SHEPHERD HE WOULD GIVE HIM A PLATE OF FOOD THE SUPPOSED SHEPHERD SAID TO HIS PARENTS I AM INDEED YOUR SON

6882-79969-0034 TURNED HIS RING ROUND AND WISHED HIS WIFE AND SON TO APPEAR IN A MOMENT THEY BOTH STOOD BEFORE HIM BUT HIS WIFE DID NOTHING BUT WEEP AND LAMENT AND SAID THAT HE HAD BROKEN HIS PROMISE
6882-79969-0035 HE SAID I HAVE ACTED INCAUTIOUSLY BUT FROM NO BAD MOTIVE AND HE TRIED TO SOOTHE HER SHE APPEARED TO BE CALMED BUT REALLY SHE NOURISHED EVIL INTENTIONS TOWARDS HIM IN HER HEART

6882-79969-0037 SO SHE SAT DOWN AND HE RESTED HIS HEAD UPON HER LAP AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP AS SOON AS HE WAS ASLEEP SHE DREW THE RING FROM HIS FINGER AND DREW HERSELF GENTLY AWAY FROM HIM LEAVING ONLY HER SLIPPER BEHIND
6882-79969-0038 LAST OF ALL TAKING HER CHILD IN HER ARMS SHE WISHED HERSELF BACK IN HER OWN KINGDOM WHEN HE WOKE UP HE FOUND HIMSELF QUITE DESERTED WIFE AND CHILD WERE GONE
6882-79969-0039 AND ONLY HER SLIPPER REMAINED AS A TOKEN I CAN CERTAINLY NEVER GO HOME TO MY PARENTS HE SAID THEY WOULD SAY I WAS A SORCERER I MUST GO AWAY AND WALK TILL I REACH MY OWN KINGDOM AGAIN SO HE WENT AWAY
6882-79969-0040 AND AT LAST HE CAME TO A MOUNTAIN WHERE THREE GIANTS WERE QUARRELLING ABOUT THE DIVISION OF THEIR FATHER'S PROPERTY WHEN THEY SAW HIM PASSING THEY CALLED HIM UP AND SAID
6882-79969-0041 AND ASKED HIM TO DIVIDE THEIR INHERITANCE FOR THEM IT CONSISTED FIRST OF A SWORD WITH WHICH IN ONE'S HAND IF ONE SAID ALL HEADS OFF MINE ALONE REMAIN EVERY HEAD FELL TO THE GROUND SECONDLY
6882-79969-0042 OF A MANTLE WHICH RENDERED ANY ONE PUTTING IT ON INVISIBLE THIRDLY
6882-79969-0043 HE TOOK HIS OWN SHAPE AGAIN AND SAID THE MANTLE IS GOOD NOW GIVE ME THE SWORD BUT THEY SAID
6882-79969-0044 ALL OUR HEADS WOULD FALL AND YOURS WOULD BE THE ONLY ONE LEFT AT LAST HOWEVER THEY GAVE IT TO HIM ON CONDITION THAT HE WAS TO TRY IT ON A TREE HE DID AS THEY WISHED AND THE SWORD WENT THROUGH THE TREE TRUNK AS IF IT HAD BEEN A STRAW

6882-79969-0046 AND WISH YOURSELF ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WE SHOULD BE LEFT STANDING HERE WITHOUT ANYTHING NO SAID HE I WON'T DO THAT
6882-79969-0047 BUT WHEN HE HAD ALL THREE HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT HIS WIFE AND CHILD
6882-79969-0048 AND IMMEDIATELY HE DISAPPEARED FROM THE SIGHT OF THE GIANTS AND THERE WAS AN END OF THEIR INHERITANCE WHEN HE APPROACHED HIS CASTLE HE HEARD SOUNDS OF MUSIC FIDDLES AND FLUTES AND SHOUTS OF JOY
6882-79969-0049 PEOPLE TOLD HIM THAT HIS WIFE WAS CELEBRATING HER MARRIAGE WITH ANOTHER HUSBAND HE WAS FILLED WITH RAGE AND SAID THE FALSE CREATURE SHE DECEIVED ME AND DESERTED ME WHEN I WAS ASLEEP
6882-79969-0050 THEN HE PUT ON HIS MANTLE AND WENT TO THE CASTLE INVISIBLE TO ALL WHEN HE WENT INTO THE HALL WHERE A GREAT FEAST WAS SPREAD WITH THE RICHEST FOODS AND THE COSTLIEST WINES THE GUESTS WERE JOKING AND LAUGHING WHILE THEY ATE AND DRANK
6882-79969-0051 THE QUEEN SAT ON HER THRONE IN THEIR MIDST IN GORGEOUS CLOTHING WITH THE CROWN ON HER HEAD HE PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND HER AND NO ONE SAW HIM WHENEVER THE QUEEN PUT A PIECE OF MEAT ON HER PLATE HE TOOK IT AWAY AND ATE IT
6882-79969-0052 AND WHEN HER GLASS WAS FILLED HE TOOK IT AWAY AND DRANK IT HER PLATE AND HER GLASS WERE CONSTANTLY REFILLED BUT SHE NEVER HAD ANYTHING FOR IT DISAPPEARED AT ONCE
6882-79969-0053 BUT HE FOLLOWED HER THERE TOO SHE SAID TO HERSELF AM I STILL IN THE POWER OF THE DEMON DID MY PRESERVER NEVER COME HE STRUCK HER IN THE FACE AND SAID DID YOUR PRESERVER NEVER COME
6882-79969-0054 HE IS WITH YOU NOW DECEIVER THAT YOU ARE DID I DESERVE SUCH TREATMENT AT YOUR HANDS THEN HE MADE HIMSELF VISIBLE AND WENT INTO THE HALL AND CRIED THE WEDDING IS STOPPED THE REAL KING HAS COME
