1160-139730-0000 BEFORE I PROCEED IN RELATING THE PART I HAD IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS UNDER THIS NEW GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION IT MAY NOT BE AMISS HERE TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF MY PHILOSOPHICAL REPUTATION
1160-139730-0001 IN SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX BEING AT BOSTON I MET THERE WITH A DOCTOR SPENCE WHO WAS LATELY ARRIVED FROM SCOTLAND AND SHOW'D ME SOME ELECTRIC EXPERIMENTS THEY WERE IMPERFECTLY PERFORM'D AS HE WAS NOT VERY EXPERT
1160-139730-0002 A PRESENT OF A GLASS TUBE WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE USE OF IT IN MAKING SUCH EXPERIMENTS I EAGERLY SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAD SEEN AT BOSTON
1160-139730-0003 ADDING A NUMBER OF NEW ONES I SAY MUCH PRACTICE FOR MY HOUSE WAS CONTINUALLY FULL FOR SOME TIME WITH PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SEE THESE NEW WONDERS
1160-139730-0004 WAS FOUNDED IN SIXTEEN SIXTY AND HOLDS THE FOREMOST PLACE AMONG ENGLISH SOCIETIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE
1160-139730-0005 TO DIVIDE A LITTLE THIS INCUMBRANCE AMONG MY FRIENDS I CAUSED A NUMBER OF SIMILAR TUBES TO BE BLOWN AT OUR GLASS HOUSE WITH WHICH THEY FURNISH'D THEMSELVES SO THAT WE HAD AT LENGTH SEVERAL PERFORMERS
1160-139730-0006 AND ACCOMPANIED WITH SUCH EXPLANATIONS IN SUCH METHOD
1160-139730-0007 SHOULD ASSIST IN COMPREHENDING THE FOLLOWING HE PROCUR'D AN ELEGANT APPARATUS FOR THE PURPOSE IN WHICH ALL THE LITTLE MACHINES THAT I HAD ROUGHLY MADE FOR MYSELF WERE NICELY FORM'D BY INSTRUMENT MAKERS HIS LECTURES
1160-139730-0008 WERE WELL ATTENDED AND GAVE GREAT SATISFACTION AND AFTER SOME TIME HE WENT THRO THE COLONIES EXHIBITING THEM IN EVERY CAPITAL TOWN AND PICK'D UP SOME MONEY
1160-139730-0009 OBLIG'D AS WE WERE TO MISTER COLLINSON FOR HIS PRESENT OF THE TUBE ET CETERA I THOUGHT IT RIGHT HE SHOULD BE INFORM'D OF OUR SUCCESS IN USING IT AND WROTE HIM SEVERAL LETTERS CONTAINING ACCOUNTS OF OUR EXPERIMENTS
1160-139730-0010 WHERE THEY WERE NOT AT FIRST THOUGHT WORTH SO MUCH NOTICE AS TO BE PRINTED IN THEIR TRANSACTIONS ONE PAPER WHICH I WROTE FOR MISTER KINNERSLEY
1160-139730-0011 AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE AND ONE OF THE MEMBERS ALSO OF THAT SOCIETY WHO WROTE ME WORD THAT IT HAD BEEN READ BUT WAS LAUGHED AT BY THE CONNOISSEURS THE PAPERS HOWEVER BEING SHOWN TO DOCTOR FOTHERGILL
1160-139730-0012 HE THOUGHT THEM OF TOO MUCH VALUE TO BE STIFLED AND ADVIS'D THE PRINTING OF THEM MISTER COLLINSON THEN GAVE THEM TO CAVE FOR PUBLICATION IN HIS GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE BUT HE CHOSE TO PRINT THEM SEPARATELY IN A PAMPHLET
1160-139730-0013 AND DOCTOR FOTHERGILL WROTE THE PREFACE CAVE IT SEEMS JUDGED RIGHTLY FOR HIS PROFIT FOR BY THE ADDITIONS
1160-139730-0014 BELIEVING IT WAS BETTER TO SPEND WHAT TIME I COULD SPARE FROM PUBLIC BUSINESS IN MAKING NEW EXPERIMENTS THAN IN DISPUTING ABOUT THOSE ALREADY MADE I THEREFORE NEVER ANSWERED
1160-139730-0015 OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES TOOK UP MY CAUSE AND REFUTED HIM
1160-139730-0016 LANGUAGES AND THE DOCTRINE IT CONTAIN'D WAS BY DEGREES UNIVERSALLY ADOPTED BY THE PHILOSOPHERS OF EUROPE IN PREFERENCE TO THAT OF THE ABBE SO THAT HE LIVED TO SEE HIMSELF THE LAST OF HIS SECT
1160-139730-0017 THIS ENGAG'D THE PUBLIC ATTENTION EVERYWHERE
1160-139730-0018 WHO HAD AN APPARATUS FOR EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY
1160-139730-0019 UNDERTOOK TO REPEAT WHAT HE CALLED THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENTS AND AFTER THEY WERE PERFORMED BEFORE THE KING AND COURT ALL THE CURIOUS OF PARIS FLOCKED TO SEE THEM I WILL NOT SWELL THIS NARRATIVE WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THAT CAPITAL EXPERIMENT
1160-139730-0020 AS BOTH ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE HISTORIES OF ELECTRICITY
