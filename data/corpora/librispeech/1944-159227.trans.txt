1944-159227-0000 AS THE BRAVE FELLOWS MARCHED AWAY TO MEET DANGER AND DEATH FOR OUR SAKES EVERY ONE WAS EAGER TO DO SOMETHING AND AS THE MEN STOOD AT EASE THE PEOPLE MINGLED FREELY WITH THEM OFFERING GIFTS
1944-159227-0001 HEARTY GRIPS OF THE HAND AND HOPEFUL PROPHECIES OF VICTORY IN THE END IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED MY BOY TOM AND I DREW NEAR AND SOON BECOMING EXCITED BY THE SCENE
1944-159227-0002 IN ONE ENTHUSIASTIC JUMBLE WHILE TOM WAS OFF ON HIS THIRD RAID MY ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY A MAN WHO STOOD A LITTLE APART LOOKING AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE FAR AWAY
1944-159227-0003 ALL THE MEN WERE FINE STALWART FELLOWS AS MAINE MEN USUALLY ARE BUT THIS ONE OVER TOPPED HIS COMRADES STANDING STRAIGHT AND TALL AS A NORWAY PINE
1944-159227-0004 WITH A FACE FULL OF THE MINGLED SHREWDNESS SOBRIETY AND SELF POSSESSION OF THE TYPICAL NEW ENGLANDER I LIKED THE LOOK OF HIM AND SEEING THAT HE SEEMED SOLITARY EVEN IN A CROWD
1944-159227-0005 I OFFERED HIM MY LAST APPLE WITH A WORD OF INTEREST THE KEEN BLUE EYES MET MINE GRATEFULLY AND THE APPLE BEGAN TO VANISH IN VIGOROUS BITES AS WE TALKED FOR NO ONE THOUGHT OF CEREMONY AT SUCH A TIME
1944-159227-0006 WHERE ARE YOU FROM WOOLIDGE MA'AM ARE YOU GLAD TO GO WAL THERE'S TWO SIDES TO THAT QUESTION I CALK'LATE TO DO MY DUTY
1944-159227-0007 AND DO IT HEARTY BUT IT IS ROUGH ON A FELLER LEAVIN HIS FOLKS FOR GOOD MAYBE THERE WAS A SUDDEN HUSKINESS IN THE MAN'S VOICE THAT WAS NOT APPLE SKINS THOUGH HE TRIED TO MAKE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS
1944-159227-0008 I KNEW A WORD ABOUT HOME WOULD COMFORT HIM
1944-159227-0009 DO YOU LEAVE A FAMILY MY OLD MOTHER A SICK BROTHER AND LUCINDY THE LAST WORD WAS UTTERED IN A TONE OF INTENSE REGRET
1944-159227-0010 AND HIS BROWN CHEEK REDDENED AS HE ADDED HASTILY TO HIDE SOME EMBARRASSMENT YOU SEE JIM WENT LAST YEAR AND GOT PRETTY WELL USED UP SO I FELT AS IF I'D OUGHT TO TAKE MY TURN NOW
1944-159227-0011 AND I DROPPED EVERYTHING AND COME OFF LUCINDY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS MY DUTY AND THAT MADE IT AWFUL HARD I TELL YOU WIVES ARE LESS PATRIOTIC THAN MOTHERS I BEGAN
1944-159227-0012 BUT HE WOULD NOT HEAR LUCINDY BLAMED AND SAID QUICKLY SHE AIN'T MY WIFE YET BUT WE CALK'LATED TO BE MARRIED IN A MONTH OR SO
1944-159227-0013 WOMEN LOT SO ON NOT BEING DISAPPOINTED
1944-159227-0014 AND HERE I BE WHEN I GIT TO WORK I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT THE FIRST WRENCH IS THE TRYIN PART
1944-159227-0015 HERE HE STRAIGHTENED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED HIS FACE TOWARD THE FLAGS FLUTTERING FAR IN FRONT AS IF NO BACKWARD LOOK SHOULD BETRAY THE LONGING OF HIS HEART FOR MOTHER HOME AND WIFE
1944-159227-0016 I LIKED THAT LITTLE GLIMPSE OF CHARACTER AND WHEN TOM RETURNED WITH EMPTY HANDS REPORTING THAT EVERY STALL WAS EXHAUSTED I TOLD HIM TO FIND OUT WHAT THE MAN WOULD LIKE BEST
1944-159227-0017 I KNOW WITHOUT ASKING GIVE US YOUR PURSE AND I'LL MAKE HIM AS HAPPY AS A KING SAID THE BOY LAUGHING AS HE LOOKED UP ADMIRINGLY AT OUR TALL FRIEND WHO LOOKED DOWN ON HIM WITH AN ELDER BROTHERLY AIR PLEASANT TO SEE
1944-159227-0018 WHILE TOM WAS GONE I FOUND OUT JOE'S NAME AND BUSINESS PROMISED TO WRITE AND TELL HIS MOTHER HOW FINELY THE REGIMENT WENT OFF AND WAS JUST EXPRESSING A HOPE THAT WE MIGHT MEET AGAIN
1944-159227-0019 WHEN THE ORDER TO FALL IN CAME ROLLING DOWN THE RANKS AND THE TALK WAS OVER FEARING TOM WOULD MISS OUR MAN IN THE CONFUSION I KEPT MY EYE ON HIM TILL THE BOY CAME RUSHING UP WITH A PACKET OF TOBACCO IN ONE HAND
1944-159227-0020 ALL LAUGHING AT THE FLURRY WHILE LESS FORTUNATE COMRADES HELPED US WITH AN EYE TO A SHARE OF THESE FRAGRANT LUXURIES BY AND BY THERE WAS JUST TIME FOR THIS A HEARTY SHAKE OF THE BIG HAND AND A GRATEFUL GOOD BY MA'AM
1944-159227-0021 WE WATCHED FOR OUR MAN AS WE ALREADY CALLED HIM AS THE INSPIRING MUSIC THE GRAND TRAMP DREW NEAR THE OLD THRILL WENT THROUGH THE CROWD THE OLD CHEER BROKE OUT
1944-159227-0022 AND BLISSFULLY UNCONSCIOUS OF ALL THAT LAY BEFORE THEM NOW THE BLUE COATS WERE WORN BY MATURE MEN SOME GRAY ALL GRAVE AND RESOLUTE HUSBANDS AND FATHERS
1944-159227-0023 HOMES LEFT DESOLATE BEHIND THEM AND BEFORE THEM THE GRIM CERTAINTY OF DANGER HARDSHIP AND PERHAPS THE LIFELONG HELPLESSNESS WORSE THAN DEATH
1944-159227-0024 LITTLE OF THE GLAMOUR OF ROMANCE ABOUT THE WAR NOW THEY SAW IT AS IT WAS A LONG HARD TASK AND HERE WERE THE MEN TO DO IT WELL EVEN THE LOOKERS ON WERE DIFFERENT NOW
1944-159227-0025 ONCE ALL WAS WILD ENTHUSIASM AND GLAD UPROAR NOW MEN'S LIPS WERE SET AND WOMEN'S SMILELESS AS THEY CHEERED FEWER HANDKERCHIEFS WHITENED THE AIR FOR WET EYES NEEDED THEM
1944-159227-0026 AND SUDDEN LULLS ALMOST SOLEMN IN THEIR STILLNESS FOLLOWED THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE CROWD ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND BRAVE SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW
1944-159227-0027 AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE
1944-159227-0028 GIVE HIM A CHEER AUNTIE HE SEES US AND REMEMBERS CRIED TOM NEARLY TUMBLING OFF HIS PERCH AS HE WAVED HIS HAT AND POINTED OUT JOE COLLINS
1944-159227-0029 YES THERE HE WAS LOOKING UP WITH A SMILE ON HIS BRAVE BROWN FACE MY LITTLE NOSEGAY IN HIS BUTTON HOLE A SUSPICIOUS BULGE IN THE POCKET CLOSE BY AND DOUBTLESS A COMFORTABLE QUID IN HIS MOUTH
1944-159227-0030 TO CHEER THE WEARY MARCH HOW LIKE AN OLD FRIEND HE LOOKED THOUGH WE HAD ONLY MET FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO HOW GLAD WE WERE TO BE THERE TO SMILE BACK AT HIM AND SEND HIM ON HIS WAY FEELING THAT
1944-159227-0031 EVEN IN A STRANGE CITY THERE WAS SOME ONE TO SAY GOD BLESS YOU JOE WE WATCHED THE TALLEST BLUE CAP TILL IT VANISHED AND THEN WENT HOME IN A GLOW OF PATRIOTISM
1944-159227-0032 TOM TO LONG FOR HIS TURN TO COME I TO SEW VIGOROUSLY ON THE GRAY GOWN THE NEW NURSE BURNED TO WEAR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BOTH OF US
1944-159227-0033 TO THINK AND SPEAK OFTEN OF POOR JOE COLLINS AND HIS LUCINDY ALL THIS HAPPENED LONG AGO BUT IT IS WELL TO RECALL THOSE STIRRING TIMES
