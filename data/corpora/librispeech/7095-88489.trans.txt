7095-88489-0000 WHEN COPERNICUS SHOWED THAT THE EARTH WAS NOT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE WHEN DARWIN PROVED THAT MAN'S ORIGIN WAS NOT THE RESULT OF DIRECT CREATION WHEN FREUD EXPLAINED THAT MAN WAS NOT THE MASTER OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS OR ACTIONS
7095-88489-0001 LLEWELYN POWYS IN THE WRITINGS OF THE GREEK AND ROMAN PHILOSOPHERS ARE FOUND THE GERMINAL CONCEPTS OF GEOLOGICAL TRUTHS BUT AS CHRISTIANITY TOOK CONTROL OF THE WORLD
7095-88489-0002 INSTEAD OF A STEADY PROGRESSION OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS FIELD THERE WAS A DISTINCT RETROGRESSION ACCORDING TO THE PREVAILING BELIEF THE EARTH WAS SOON TO BE DESTROYED AND THE COLLECTING OF KNOWLEDGE WAS FUTILE AND ANY STUDY OF ITS NATURE WAS VAIN
7095-88489-0003 SAINT JEROME STATED THAT THE BROKEN AND TWISTED CRUST OF THE EARTH EXHIBITED THE WRATH OF GOD AGAINST SIN TERTULLIAN ASSERTED THAT FOSSILS RESULTED FROM THE FLOOD OF NOAH
7095-88489-0004 IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE THEOLOGICAL FACULTY OF PARIS PROTESTED AGAINST THE SCIENTIFIC DOCTRINE AS UNSCRIPTURAL DESTROYED THEIR TREATISES AND BANISHED THEIR AUTHORS FROM PARIS
7095-88489-0005 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BUFFON IN FRANCE PRODUCED A THESIS ATTEMPTING TO STATE SIMPLE GEOLOGICAL TRUTHS THE THEOLOGICAL FACULTY OF THE SORBONNE
7095-88489-0006 DISMISSED HIM FROM HIS HIGH POSITION AND FORCED HIM TO PRINT A RECANTATION STATING I DECLARE THAT I HAD NO INTENTION TO CONTRADICT THE TEXT OF THE SCRIPTURE THAT I BELIEVE MOST FIRMLY ALL THEREIN RELATED ABOUT THE CREATION
7095-88489-0007 BOTH AS TO ORDER OF TIME AND MATTER OF FACT I ABANDON EVERYTHING IN MY BOOK RESPECTING THE FORMATION OF THE EARTH AND GENERALLY ALL WHICH MAY BE CONTRARY TO THE NARRATIVE OF MOSES THE DOCTRINE WHICH BUFFON ABANDONED
7095-88489-0008 IS NOW AS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AS THAT OF THE EARTH'S ROTATION UPON ITS AXIS YET IN HIS DAY IT WAS HEATEDLY ASSERTED BY ECCLESIASTICS THAT THE SCIENTIFIC DOCTRINE THAT FOSSILS REPRESENT ANIMALS WHICH DIED BEFORE ADAM
7095-88489-0009 CONTRADICTS THE THEOLOGICAL DOCTRINE OF ADAM'S FALL AND THE STATEMENT THAT DEATH ENTERED THE WORLD BY SIN AND THIS OBJECTION WAS FURTHER STRENGTHENED WHEN THE ECCLESIASTICS BECAME COGNIZANT THAT GEOLOGY HAD PROVED
7095-88489-0010 THAT THE EARTH WAS VASTLY OLDER THAN THE SIX THOUSAND YEARS DETERMINED BY ARCHBISHOP USSHER'S INTERPRETATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ABOUT FIFTEEN EIGHTY
7095-88489-0011 THAT THE CREATION OF MAN TOOK PLACE
7095-88489-0012 IN SIXTEEN FIFTY ARCHBISHOP USSHER ANNOUNCED AFTER CAREFUL STUDY THAT MAN WAS CREATED FOUR THOUSAND AND FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN ERA BUT THIS PROVING TOO VAGUE DOCTOR JOHN LIGHTFOOT
7095-88489-0013 VICE CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE ASSURED THE WORLD THAT HEAVEN AND EARTH CENTRE AND CIRCUMFERENCE WERE CREATED TOGETHER IN THE SAME INSTANT AND CLOUDS FULL OF WATER AND THIS WORK TOOK PLACE
7095-88489-0014 AND MAN WAS CREATED BY THE TRINITY
7095-88489-0015 WHEN THE EGYPTOLOGISTS ASSYRIOLOGISTS ARCHEOLOGISTS AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS SHOWED THAT MAN HAD REACHED A FAR ADVANCED STAGE OF CIVILIZATION
7095-88489-0016 LONG BEFORE THE SIX THOUSAND YEARS GIVEN AS THE AGE OF THE EARTH THEIR EFFORTS WERE RIDICULED BY THE CLERGY AND THESE SCIENTISTS WERE FORCED TO BRING THEIR FINDINGS BEFORE THE WORLD
7095-88489-0017 IN THE FACE OF THE WELL KNOWN METHODS OF ECCLESIASTICAL OPPOSITION AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD IN THE EVOLUTION OF CIVILIZATION MEN BEGAN TO ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING LANGUAGE AND THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS
7095-88489-0018 WERE NATURALLY EMBODIED IN THE MYTHS LEGENDS AND CHRONICLES OF THEIR SACRED BOOKS LANGUAGE WAS CONSIDERED GOD GIVEN AND COMPLETE THE DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGE WAS FIRMLY HELD TO BE EXPLAINED
7095-88489-0019 BY THE STORY OF THE TOWER OF BABEL AND SINCE THE WRITERS OF THE BIBLE WERE MERELY PENS IN THE HAND OF GOD THE CONCLUSION WAS REACHED THAT NOT ONLY THE SENSE BUT THE WORDS LETTERS AND EVEN THE PUNCTUATION
7095-88489-0020 PROCEEDED FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT AT THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE ECCLESIASTICAL CONTENTION THAT THE HEBREW PUNCTUATION WAS DIVINELY INSPIRED SEEMED TO BE GENERALLY DISPROVEN
7095-88489-0021 THE GREAT ORTHODOX BODY OF RELIGIOSA DEMENTIA FELL BACK UPON THE REMAINDER OF THE THEORY THAT THE HEBREW LANGUAGE WAS THE FIRST OF ALL LANGUAGES WHICH WAS SPOKEN BY THE ALMIGHTY GIVEN BY HIM TO ADAM
7095-88489-0022 THAT LANGUAGE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AS THE RESULT OF EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES IN OBEDIENCE TO LAWS MORE OR LESS CLEARLY ASCERTAINED BABEL THUS TAKES ITS PLACE QUIETLY AMONG THE OTHER MYTHS OF THE BIBLE
7095-88489-0023 IN A PURELY CIVIL MATTER THE INFALLIBLE CHURCH FROM ITS INCEPTION HAD DISPLAYED A MARKED HOSTILITY TO LOANS AT INTEREST FROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD
7095-88489-0024 THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THE CHURCH WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR AGAINST THE TAKING OF INTEREST FOR MONEY POPE LEO THE GREAT SOLEMNLY ADJUDGED IT A SIN WORTHY OF SEVERE PUNISHMENT IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY
7095-88489-0025 BY HIS DECLARATION THAT EVEN TO ADVANCE ON INTEREST THE MONEY NECESSARY IN MARITIME TRADE WAS DAMNABLE USURY THE WHOLE EVOLUTION OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION WAS GREATLY HINDERED BY THIS POLICY
7095-88489-0026 RELIGION AND EVOLUTION DARWINISM WHICH AT FIRST WAS DECLARED BY THE CLERGY TO BE BRUTAL DEGRADING
7095-88489-0027 ATHEISTIC AND ANTI CHRISTIAN IS NOW INCLUDED AS PART OF THE BIBLE TEACHING IN A SIMILAR MANNER THE COPERNICAN THEORY THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS
7095-88489-0028 THE THEORY OF UNIFORMITY IN GEOLOGY AND EVERY SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE HAS BEEN OPPOSED ON THE SAME GROUNDS THAT IS THAT THESE ARE AGAINST THE TEACHINGS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AND HOW MANY GALILEOS BRUNOS AND DARWINS
7095-88489-0029 AND OTHER WOULD BE BENEFACTORS TO THE HUMAN RACE HAVE DIED MUTE BECAUSE OF THIS OPPOSITION AND FEAR OF PERSECUTION BY THE CHURCH IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AN EMINENT FRENCH CATHOLIC PHYSICIAN
7095-88489-0030 DOCTOR CONSTANTIN JAMES PUBLISHED AN ELABORATE ANSWER TO DARWIN'S BOOK HE CALLED IT ON DARWINISM OR THE APE MAN
7095-88489-0031 THAT HE SENT THE AUTHOR A REPLY IN WHICH HE STATED THAT IT REFUTES SO WELL THE ABERRATIONS OF DARWINISM A SYSTEM WHICH IS REPUGNANT AT ONCE TO HISTORY TO THE TRADITIONS OF ALL PEOPLES TO EXACT SCIENCE
7095-88489-0032 TO OBSERVED FACTS AND EVEN TO REASON ITSELF
7095-88489-0033 DID NOT ALIENATION FROM GOD AND THE LEANING TOWARD MATERIALISM DUE TO DEPRAVITY EAGERLY SEEK SUPPORT IN ALL THIS TISSUE OF FABLES THE PROTESTANT CLERGY WERE NO LESS VIGOROUS IN THEIR OPPOSITION
7095-88489-0034 IN OUR OWN COUNTRY IT WAS OPPOSED BY DOCTOR NOAH PORTER PRESIDENT OF YALE COLLEGE
7095-88489-0035 BOTH LEADING AUTHORITIES AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY FUNDAMENTALISM IN THE UNITED STATES FURNISHED THE SPECTACLE OF THE TRIAL IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE OF A SCHOOL TEACHER NAMED SCOPES FOR TEACHING THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION
7095-88489-0036 DAYTON TENNESSEE BECAME THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE EDUCATED WORLD AND THE DERISION WITH WHICH THIS EFFORT TO OBSTRUCT KNOWLEDGE AT THIS LATE DATE WAS MET WITH BY THE COMMENTS OF THE PRESS IN THIS COUNTRY AND ABROAD IS AT LEAST ENCOURAGING
7095-88489-0037 BUT IT IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF WHAT EFFECT RELIGIOUS OBSCURANTISM MAY EXERT IN BACKWARD SECTIONS OF OUR COUNTRY DOCTOR MAX CARL OTTO CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS OF EVOLUTION
7095-88489-0038 CALLS ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING TAKE THE EVOLUTION OF LIVING FORMS THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT BIOLOGICAL HISTORY THE CLEARER IT BECOMES THAT THE PROCESS HAS BEEN FROM THE HUMAN POINT OF VIEW INCREDIBLY BUNGLING AND WASTEFUL
7095-88489-0039 THERE HAVE BEEN FUTILE EXPERIMENTS WITHOUT NUMBER HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE BEEN THROWN ASIDE ONE TYPE OF LIFE AFTER ANOTHER HAS ARISEN AND HAS PUSHED UP A BLIND ALLEY TO EXTINCTION IF THERE IS A GOD WHOSE METHOD HAS BEEN EVOLUTION
7095-88489-0040 THEN SEEMINGLY HIS SLOGAN WAS WE'LL FIGHT IT OUT ALONG THIS LINE IF IT TAKES A BILLENNIUM BUT UNLIKE GRANT HE HAS ALWAYS SURRENDERED IN THIS MAELSTROM THE HUMAN SPECIES AS THOMAS HUXLEY SAID
7095-88489-0041 KEEPING ITS HEAD ABOVE WATER AS BEST IT MIGHT AND THINKING NEITHER OF WHENCE NOR WHITHER MANY VOLUMES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN TO GIVE A PURPOSIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE RISE AND EVOLUTIONARY RAMIFICATIONS OF LIVING FORMS
7095-88489-0042 THE COURSE OF EVOLUTION ITSELF IS THEIR REFUTATION WHEN THE CHURCHES COULD NO LONGER IGNORE THE RISING TIDE OF SECULAR OPINION THEY RESORTED TO COMPROMISE
7095-88489-0043 AND CALLED TO THEIR AID A CERTAIN NUMBER OF INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST SCIENTISTS THE ATTEMPT TO HARMONIZE CHRISTIANITY AND EVOLUTION CAN ONLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN TERMS OF EITHER DISHONESTY OR STUPIDITY
7095-88489-0044 AND THAT IS TRUE OF THE WHOLE RANGE OF SCIENCE SCIENCE IS IN FACT ATHEISTIC OR NOTHING IT KNOWS NOTHING OF GOD IT DOES NOT BOTHER ABOUT GOD ITS TRIUMPHS ARE ACHIEVED BY LEAVING GOD OUT OF ACCOUNT
7095-88489-0045 WHAT HAS HERETOFORE BEEN MENTIONED IS BUT A MERE TRIFLE WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE VAST NUMBER OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN WHICH RELIGION HAS PLAYED THE ROLE OF BARRIER TO PROGRESS
