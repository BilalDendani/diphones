3595-418-0000 BUT A LITTLE FURTHER OFF NO MOTION IS VISIBLE NOR ANYTHING SAVE COLOR DIM WARM BLUE OF WATER
3595-418-0001 ILLUMINED BY A SUNSHINE SOFT AS MEMORY WHAT I HAVE THUS BEEN TRYING TO DESCRIBE IS A KAKEMONO THAT IS TO SAY A JAPANESE PAINTING ON SILK
3595-418-0002 SUSPENDED TO THE WALL OF MY ALCOVE AND THE NAME OF IT IS SHINKIRO WHICH SIGNIFIES MIRAGE BUT THE SHAPES OF THE MIRAGE ARE UNMISTAKABLE
3595-418-0003 THOSE ARE THE GLIMMERING PORTALS OF HORAI THE BLEST AND THOSE ARE THE MOONY ROOFS OF THE PALACE OF THE DRAGON KING AND THE FASHION OF THEM
3595-418-0004 THOUGH LIMNED BY A JAPANESE BRUSH OF TO DAY IS THE FASHION OF THINGS CHINESE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
3595-418-0005 THUS MUCH IS TOLD OF THE PLACE IN THE CHINESE BOOKS OF THAT TIME IN HORAI THERE IS NEITHER DEATH NOR PAIN AND THERE IS NO WINTER
3595-418-0006 THE FLOWERS IN THAT PLACE NEVER FADE AND THE FRUITS NEVER FAIL AND IF A MAN TASTE OF THOSE FRUITS EVEN BUT ONCE HE CAN NEVER AGAIN FEEL

3595-418-0011 UNTIL THE EATER DESIRES NO MORE AND THE PEOPLE OF HORAI DRINK THEIR WINE OUT OF VERY VERY
3595-418-0012 EVEN IN A MIRAGE IS NOT BELIEVABLE FOR REALLY THERE ARE NO ENCHANTED FRUITS WHICH LEAVE THE EATER FOREVER SATISFIED
3595-418-0013 NOR ANY MAGICAL GRASS WHICH REVIVES THE DEAD NOR ANY FOUNTAIN OF FAIRY WATER
3595-418-0014 BONE AND THE HEAPING OF SNOW IS MONSTROUS ON THE ROOFS OF THE DRAGON KING NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE WONDERFUL THINGS IN HORAI
3595-418-0015 AND THE MOST WONDERFUL OF ALL HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED BY ANY CHINESE WRITER
3595-418-0016 THE ATMOSPHERE OF HORAI IT IS AN ATMOSPHERE PECULIAR TO THE PLACE AND BECAUSE OF IT THE SUNSHINE IN HORAI IS WHITER THAN ANY OTHER SUNSHINE
3595-418-0017 AND IT IS NOT A MIXTURE OF NITROGEN AND OXYGEN IT IS NOT MADE OF AIR AT ALL BUT OF GHOST
3595-418-0018 THE SUBSTANCE OF QUINTILLIONS OF QUINTILLIONS OF GENERATIONS OF SOULS BLENDED INTO ONE IMMENSE TRANSLUCENCY
3595-418-0019 WHATEVER MORTAL MAN INHALES THAT ATMOSPHERE HE TAKES INTO HIS BLOOD THE THRILLING OF THESE SPIRITS AND THEY CHANGE THE SENSE WITHIN HIM
3595-418-0020 RESHAPING HIS NOTIONS OF SPACE
3595-418-0021 SO THAT HE CAN SEE ONLY AS THEY USED TO SEE AND FEEL ONLY AS THEY USED TO FEEL AND THINK ONLY AS THEY USED TO THINK
3595-418-0022 SOFT AS SLEEP ARE THESE CHANGES OF SENSE AND HORAI DISCERNED ACROSS THEM
3595-418-0023 THE PEOPLE OF HORAI SMILE FROM BIRTH UNTIL DEATH EXCEPT WHEN THE GODS SEND SORROW AMONG THEM
3595-418-0024 ALL FOLK IN HORAI LOVE AND TRUST EACH OTHER AS IF ALL WERE MEMBERS OF A SINGLE HOUSEHOLD
3595-418-0025 IS LIKE BIRDSONG
3595-418-0026 IN HORAI NOTHING IS HIDDEN BUT GRIEF BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON FOR SHAME AND NOTHING IS LOCKED AWAY
3595-418-0027 BECAUSE THERE COULD NOT BE ANY THEFT AND BY NIGHT AS WELL AS BY DAY ALL DOORS REMAIN UNBARRED BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON FOR FEAR
3595-418-0028 GHOSTLY ATMOSPHERE BUT NOT ALL
3595-418-0029 HAS FOUND FULFILLMENT IN MANY HEARTS IN THE SIMPLE BEAUTY OF UNSELFISH LIVES IN THE SWEETNESS OF WOMAN EVIL WINDS
3595-418-0030 FROM THE WEST ARE BLOWING OVER HORAI AND THE MAGICAL ATMOSPHERE ALAS IS SHRINKING AWAY BEFORE THEM IT LINGERS NOW IN PATCHES ONLY
3595-418-0031 UNDER THESE SHREDS OF THE ELFISH VAPOR
3595-418-0032 BUT NOT EVERYWHERE REMEMBER THAT HORAI IS ALSO CALLED SHINKIRO
