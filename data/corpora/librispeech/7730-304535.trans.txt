7730-304535-0000 I WILL GO BEFORE THEE AND MAKE THE CROOKED PLACES STRAIGHT I WILL BREAK IN PIECES THE GATES OF BRASS AND CUT IN SUNDER THE BARS OF IRON
7730-304535-0001 IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MY HUSBAND WAS APPOINTED BY THE CANADIAN PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH TO OPEN A NEW FIELD IN THE NORTHERN SECTION OF THE PROVINCE OF HONAN CHINA WE LEFT CANADA THE FOLLOWING JANUARY REACHING CHINA IN MARCH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
7730-304535-0002 NOT TILL THEN DID WE REALIZE THE TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTIES OF THE TASK BEFORE US DOCTOR HUDSON TAYLOR OF THE CHINA INLAND MISSION WRITING TO US AT THIS TIME SAID WE UNDERSTAND NORTH HONAN IS TO BE YOUR FIELD
7730-304535-0003 WE AS A MISSION HAVE TRIED FOR TEN YEARS TO ENTER THAT PROVINCE FROM THE SOUTH AND HAVE ONLY JUST SUCCEEDED IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ANTI FOREIGN PROVINCES IN CHINA BROTHER IF YOU WOULD ENTER THAT PROVINCE YOU MUST GO FORWARD ON YOUR KNEES
7730-304535-0004 WOULD THAT A FAITHFUL RECORD HAD BEEN KEPT OF GOD'S FAITHFULNESS IN ANSWERING PRAYER OUR STRENGTH AS A MISSION AND AS INDIVIDUALS DURING THOSE YEARS SO FRAUGHT WITH DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES
7730-304535-0005 LAY IN THE FACT THAT WE DID REALIZE THE HOPELESSNESS OF OUR TASK APART FROM DIVINE AID THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE WE WERE STILL OUTSIDE HONAN STUDYING THE LANGUAGE AT A SISTER MISSION
7730-304535-0006 IT ILLUSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER FROM THE HOME BASE FOR THOSE ON THE FIELD MY HUSBAND WAS FINDING GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ACQUIRING THE LANGUAGE HE STUDIED FAITHFULLY MANY HOURS DAILY BUT MADE PAINFULLY SLOW PROGRESS
7730-304535-0007 HE AND HIS COLLEAGUE WENT REGULARLY TOGETHER TO THE STREET CHAPEL TO PRACTISE PREACHING IN CHINESE TO THE PEOPLE
7730-304535-0008 BUT THOUGH MISTER GOFORTH HAD COME TO CHINA ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE THE OTHER MISSIONARY THE PEOPLE WOULD ASK THE LATTER TO SPEAK INSTEAD OF MISTER GOFORTH SAYING THEY UNDERSTOOD HIM BETTER
7730-304535-0009 HE TOLD ME THAT HE REALIZED MOST UNUSUAL HELP WHEN HIS TURN CAME TO SPEAK SENTENCES CAME TO HIS MIND AS NEVER BEFORE AND NOT ONLY HAD HE MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD BUT SOME HAD APPEARED MUCH MOVED COMING UP AFTERWARD TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH HIM
7730-304535-0010 SO DELIGHTED AND ENCOURAGED WAS HE WITH THIS EXPERIENCE THAT HE MADE A CAREFUL NOTE OF IT IN HIS DIARY SOME TWO MONTHS AND A HALF LATER A LETTER CAME FROM A STUDENT IN KNOX COLLEGE SAYING THAT ON A CERTAIN EVENING
7730-304535-0011 A NUMBER OF STUDENTS HAD MET SPECIALLY TO PRAY FOR MISTER GOFORTH THE POWER OF PRAYER WAS SUCH AND THE PRESENCE OF GOD SO MANIFESTLY FELT THAT THEY DECIDED TO WRITE AND ASK MISTER GOFORTH IF ANY SPECIAL HELP HAD COME TO HIM AT THAT TIME
7730-304535-0012 LOOKING IN HIS DIARY HE FOUND THAT THE TIME OF THEIR MEETING CORRESPONDED WITH THAT TIME OF SPECIAL HELP IN THE LANGUAGE I CANNOT TELL WHY THERE SHOULD COME TO ME A THOUGHT OF SOME ONE MILES AND YEARS AWAY
7730-304535-0013 WE ARE TOO BUSY TO SPARE THOUGHT FOR DAYS TOGETHER OF SOME FRIENDS AWAY PERHAPS GOD DOES IT FOR US AND WE OUGHT TO READ HIS SIGNAL AS A SIGN TO PRAY
7730-304535-0014 PERHAPS JUST THEN MY FRIEND HAS FIERCER FIGHT A MORE APPALLING WEAKNESS A DECAY OF COURAGE DARKNESS SOME LOST SENSE OF RIGHT AND SO IN CASE HE NEEDS MY PRAYERS I PRAY AT LAST THE JOYFUL NEWS REACHED US WOMEN
7730-304535-0015 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE IN THE HOMELAND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE YEARS OF WAITING HAD MEANT TO SOME OF US THE DANGER TO THOSE DEAR TO US TOURING IN HONAN WAS VERY GREAT
7730-304535-0016 FOR YEARS THEY NEVER LEFT US TO GO ON A TOUR WITHOUT OUR BEING FILLED WITH DREAD LEST THEY SHOULD NEVER RETURN YET THE LORD IN HIS MERCY HEARD OUR PRAYERS FOR THEM AND THOUGH OFTEN IN GRAVE DANGER NONE RECEIVED SERIOUS INJURY
7730-304535-0017 THIS IS NOT A HISTORY OF THE MISSION BUT I CANNOT FORBEAR GIVING HERE ONE INCIDENT ILLUSTRATING HOW THEY WERE KEPT DURING THOSE EARLY DAYS
7730-304535-0018 MOVED IN INTENDING TO SPEND THE WINTER THERE BUT A SUDDEN AND BITTER PERSECUTION AROSE JUST AS THEY HAD BECOME SETTLED THE MISSION PREMISES WERE ATTACKED BY A MOB AND EVERYTHING WAS LOOTED
7730-304535-0019 THE TWO MEN WERE ROUGHLY HANDLED ONE BEING DRAGGED ABOUT THE COURTYARD THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT LAST LEFT ALONE THEIR LIVES SPARED BUT EVERYTHING GONE THEIR POSITION WAS SERIOUS IN THE EXTREME
7730-304535-0020 SEVERAL DAYS JOURNEY AWAY FROM FRIENDS WITH NO MONEY NO BEDDING AND NO CLOTHES BUT THOSE UPON THEM AND THE COLD WINTER BEGUN
7730-304535-0021 AND ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE HE DELIVERED THEM OUT OF THEIR DISTRESSES FOR EVEN WHILE THEY PRAYED A BROTHER MISSIONARY FROM A DISTANT STATION WAS AT HAND HE ARRIVED UNEXPECTEDLY WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HAD OCCURRED A FEW HOURS AFTER THE LOOTING HAD TAKEN PLACE
7730-304535-0022 A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE ABOVE INCIDENT SEVERAL FAMILIES MOVED INTO HONAN AND A PERMANENT OCCUPATION WAS EFFECTED BUT THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE SEEMED AS ADAMANT AGAINST US THEY HATED AND DISTRUSTED US AS IF WE WERE THEIR WORST ENEMIES
7730-304535-0023 THE DISTRICT IN WHICH WE SETTLED WAS KNOWN FOR ITS TURBULENT AND ANTI FOREIGN SPIRIT AND AS A BAND OF MISSIONARIES WE WERE FREQUENTLY IN THE GRAVEST DANGER MANY TIMES WE REALIZED THAT WE AS WELL AS OUR FELLOW WORKERS AT THE OTHER STATIONS WERE KEPT FROM SERIOUS HARM
7730-304535-0024 THE FOLLOWING ARE CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF HOW GOD HEARD OUR PRAYERS AT THIS TIME WE HAD FOR OUR STATION DOCTOR A MAN OF SPLENDID GIFTS HE WAS A GOLD MEDALIST WITH YEARS OF SPECIAL TRAINING AND HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE
7730-304535-0025 AND WAS LOOKED UPON AS ONE OF THE RISING PHYSICIANS IN THE CITY FROM WHICH HE CAME IMAGINE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT THEREFORE WHEN MONTH AFTER MONTH PASSED AND SCARCELY A GOOD CASE CAME TO THE HOSPITAL
7730-304535-0026 THE PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE COULD DO AND MOREOVER THEY WERE AFRAID TO TRUST THEMSELVES INTO HIS HANDS
7730-304535-0027 VERY MUCH DEPENDED UPON THE OUTCOME OF THIS AND OTHER SERIOUS OPERATIONS HAD THE PATIENTS DIED UNDER THE DOCTOR'S HANDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SUFFICIENT TO HAVE CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION OF THE MISSION PREMISES AND THE LIFE OF EVERY MISSIONARY
7730-304535-0028 THREE YEARS LATER THE HOSPITAL RECORDS SHOWED THAT THERE HAD BEEN TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND TREATMENTS IN ONE YEAR AGAIN WE KEPT PRAYING THAT THE LORD WOULD GIVE US CONVERTS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
7730-304535-0029 WE HAD HEARD OF MISSIONARIES IN INDIA CHINA AND ELSEWHERE WHO HAD WORKED FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT GAINING CONVERTS BUT WE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS GOD'S WILL FOR US WE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS HIS PLEASURE AND PURPOSE TO SAVE MEN AND WOMEN THROUGH HIS HUMAN CHANNELS
7730-304535-0030 AND WHY NOT FROM THE BEGINNING SO WE KEPT PRAYING AND WORKING AND EXPECTING CONVERTS AND GOD GAVE THEM TO US THE EXPERIENCE OF THIRTY YEARS HAS CONFIRMED THIS BELIEF SPACE PERMITS THE MENTION OF BUT TWO OF THESE EARLIEST CONVERTS
7730-304535-0031 WHO CAME WITH US INTO HONAN AS MISTER GOFORTH'S PERSONAL TEACHER HE WAS A MAN OF HIGH DEGREE EQUAL TO THE WESTERN M A AND WAS ONE OF THE PROUDEST AND MOST OVERBEARING OF CONFUCIAN SCHOLARS
7730-304535-0032 BUT MISTER GOFORTH KEPT PRAYING FOR THIS MAN AND USING ALL HIS INFLUENCE TO WIN HIM FOR CHRIST BEFORE MANY MONTHS PASSED A GREAT CHANGE HAD COME OVER MISTER WANG HIS PROUD OVERBEARING MANNER HAD CHANGED AND HE BECAME A HUMBLE DEVOUT FOLLOWER OF THE LOWLY NAZARENE
7730-304535-0033 GOD USED A DREAM TO AWAKEN THIS MAN'S CONSCIENCE AS IS NOT UNCOMMON IN CHINA ONE NIGHT HE DREAMED HE WAS STRUGGLING IN A DEEP MIRY PIT
7730-304535-0034 BUT TRY AS HE WOULD HE COULD FIND NO WAY OF ESCAPE WHEN ABOUT TO GIVE UP IN DESPAIR HE LOOKED UP AND SAW MISTER GOFORTH AND ANOTHER MISSIONARY ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH THEIR HANDS STRETCHED OUT TO SAVE HIM
7730-304535-0035 AGAIN HE SOUGHT FOR SOME OTHER WAY OF ESCAPE BUT FINDING NONE HE ALLOWED THEM TO DRAW HIM UP THIS MAN LATER ON BECAME MISTER GOFORTH'S MOST VALUED EVANGELIST
7730-304535-0036 FOR MANY YEARS HIS SPLENDID GIFTS WERE USED TO THE GLORY OF HIS MASTER IN THE WORK AMONG THE SCHOLAR CLASS IN THE CHANGTEFU DISTRICT HE HAS LONG SINCE PASSED TO HIS REWARD DYING AS HE HAD LIVED TRUSTING ONLY IN THE MERIT OF JESUS CHRIST FOR SALVATION
7730-304535-0037 ANOTHER OF THE BRIGHT GLINTS IN THE DARKNESS OF THOSE EARLIEST DAYS IN HONAN WAS THE REMARKABLE CONVERSION OF WANG FU LIN
7730-304535-0038 FOR MANY YEARS HIS BUSINESS HAD BEEN THAT OF A PUBLIC STORY TELLER BUT WHEN MISTER GOFORTH CAME ACROSS HIM HE WAS REDUCED TO AN UTTER WRECK THROUGH OPIUM SMOKING
7730-304535-0039 HE ACCEPTED THE GOSPEL BUT FOR A LONG TIME SEEMED TOO WEAK TO BREAK OFF THE OPIUM HABIT AGAIN AND AGAIN HE TRIED TO DO SO BUT FAILED HOPELESSLY EACH TIME
7730-304535-0040 THE POOR FELLOW SEEMED ALMOST PAST HOPE WHEN ONE DAY MISTER GOFORTH BROUGHT HIM TO THE MISSION IN HIS CART THE TEN DAYS THAT FOLLOWED CAN NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BY THOSE WHO WATCHED WANG FU LIN STRUGGLE FOR PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL LIFE
7730-304535-0041 I VERILY BELIEVE NOTHING BUT PRAYER COULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM THROUGH AT THE END OF THE TEN DAYS THE POWER OF OPIUM WAS BROKEN AND WANG FU LIN CAME OUT OF THE STRUGGLE A NEW MAN IN CHRIST JESUS I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO SPEAK OF THIS MAN AGAIN
7730-304535-0042 IN ALL THE CASES OF DIVINE HEALING CITED IN THIS RECORD IT WILL BE NOTED THAT GOD HEALED IN ANSWER TO PRAYER EITHER WHEN THE DOCTORS HAD DONE ALL IN THEIR POWER AND HOPE HAD BEEN ABANDONED OR WHEN WE WERE OUT OF REACH OF MEDICAL AID
7730-304535-0043 ONE OF THE MOST DEVOTED AND SAINTLY OF GOD'S MISSIONARIES GAVE A TESTIMONY WHICH LATER WAS USED OF GOD TO SAVE THE WRITER FROM GIVING UP SERVICE IN CHINA AND RETURNING HOME TO CANADA
7730-304535-0044 DOCTOR CORBETT SAID THAT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HE HAD BEEN LAID ASIDE EVERY YEAR WITH THAT TERRIBLE SCOURGE OF THE EAST DYSENTERY AND THE DOCTORS AT LAST GAVE A DEFINITE DECISION THAT HE MUST RETURN AT ONCE TO THE HOMELAND AND FORSAKE CHINA
7730-304535-0045 BUT SAID THE GRAND OLD MAN I KNEW GOD HAD CALLED ME TO CHINA AND I ALSO KNEW THAT GOD DID NOT CHANGE SO WHAT COULD I DO I DARED NOT GO BACK ON MY CALL SO I DETERMINED THAT IF I COULD NOT LIVE IN CHINA I COULD DIE THERE
7730-304535-0046 AND FROM THAT TIME THE DISEASE LOST ITS HOLD ON ME
7730-304535-0047 AT LAST ONE DAY MY HUSBAND BROUGHT ME THE DECISION OF THE DOCTORS THAT I SHOULD RETURN HOME AND AS I LAY THERE ILL AND WEAK THE TEMPTATION CAME TO YIELD BUT AS I REMEMBERED DOCTOR CORBETT'S TESTIMONY AND MY OWN CLEAR CALL
7730-304535-0048 I FELT THAT TO GO BACK WOULD BE TO GO AGAINST MY OWN CONSCIENCE I THEREFORE DETERMINED TO DO AS DOCTOR CORBETT HAD DONE LEAVE MYSELF IN THE LORD'S HANDS WHETHER FOR LIFE OR FOR DEATH THIS HAPPENED MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO
7730-304535-0049 AND SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE TROUBLE FROM THAT DREAD DISEASE YES THE DEEPER THE NEED AND THE MORE BITTER THE EXTREMITY THE GREATER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GOD TO SHOW FORTH HIS MIGHTY POWER IN OUR LIVES
7730-304535-0050 DURING OUR FOURTH YEAR IN CHINA WHEN WE WERE SPENDING THE HOT SEASON AT THE COAST OUR LITTLE SON EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD WAS TAKEN VERY ILL WITH DYSENTERY AFTER SEVERAL DAYS FIGHT FOR THE CHILD'S LIFE CAME THE REALIZATION ONE EVENING
7730-304535-0051 THAT THE ANGEL OF DEATH WAS AT HAND MY WHOLE SOUL REBELLED I ACTUALLY SEEMED TO HATE GOD I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT CRUEL INJUSTICE IN IT ALL AND THE CHILD SEEMED TO BE FAST GOING
7730-304535-0052 MY HUSBAND AND I KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE LITTLE ONE'S BEDSIDE AND HE PLEADED EARNESTLY WITH ME TO YIELD MY WILL AND MY CHILD TO GOD AFTER A LONG AND BITTER STRUGGLE GOD GAINED THE VICTORY AND I TOLD MY HUSBAND I WOULD GIVE MY CHILD TO THE LORD
7730-304535-0053 THEN MY HUSBAND PRAYED COMMITTING THE PRECIOUS SOUL INTO THE LORD'S KEEPING WHILE HE WAS PRAYING I NOTICED THAT THE RAPID HARD BREATHING OF THE CHILD HAD CEASED THINKING MY DARLING WAS GONE I HASTENED FOR A LIGHT FOR IT WAS DARK
7730-304535-0054 BUT ON EXAMINING THE CHILD'S FACE I FOUND THAT HE HAD SUNK INTO A DEEP SOUND NATURAL SLEEP WHICH LASTED MOST OF THE NIGHT THE FOLLOWING DAY HE WAS PRACTICALLY WELL OF THE DYSENTERY
7730-304535-0055 TO ME IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED THAT THE LORD TESTED ME TO ALMOST THE LAST MOMENT THEN WHEN I YIELDED MY DEAREST TREASURE TO HIM AND PUT MY LORD FIRST HE GAVE BACK THE CHILD
7730-304535-0056 WHILE WRITING THE ABOVE I CAME ACROSS AN EXTRACT FROM THE CHRISTIAN OF MARCH TWELFTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN IN WHICH THE EDITOR SAID SPEAKING AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE HUNTINGDON COUNTY HOSPITAL
7730-304535-0057 LORD SANDWICH REFERRED TO THE POWER OF SPIRITUAL HEALING
