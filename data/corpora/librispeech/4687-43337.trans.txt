4687-43337-0000 HE ACTED RATHER THAN INDULGED IN REFLEX THOUGHT BUT THE CENTRE OF HIS POSITION WAS SIMPLE FAITH THE CATHOLIC RELIGION HE KNEW WELL ENOUGH GAVE THE ONLY ADEQUATE EXPLANATION OF THE UNIVERSE IT DID NOT UNLOCK ALL MYSTERIES
4687-43337-0001 AND ACCOUNTED FOR HIM IN HIS ESSENTIAL NATURE FURTHER HE SAW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE FAILURE OF CHRISTIANITY TO UNITE ALL MEN ONE TO ANOTHER RESTED NOT UPON ITS FEEBLENESS BUT ITS STRENGTH ITS LINES MET IN ETERNITY
4687-43337-0002 NOT IN TIME BESIDES HE HAPPENED TO BELIEVE IT BUT TO THIS FOREGROUND THERE WERE OTHER MOODS WHOSE SHIFTING WAS OUT OF HIS CONTROL IN HIS EXALT MOODS WHICH CAME UPON HIM LIKE A BREEZE FROM PARADISE
4687-43337-0003 THE HUGE SUPERINCUMBENT WEIGHT OF INCREDULITY COULD NOT DISTURB A FACT THAT WAS AS THE SUN IN HEAVEN MOREOVER THE VERY DESPERATENESS OF THE CAUSE WAS THEIR INSPIRATION THERE WAS NO TEMPTATION TO LEAN UPON THE ARM OF FLESH
4687-43337-0004 FOR THERE WAS NONE THAT FOUGHT FOR THEM BUT GOD THEIR NAKEDNESS WAS THEIR ARMOUR THEIR SLOW TONGUES THEIR PERSUASIVENESS THEIR WEAKNESS DEMANDED GOD'S STRENGTH AND FOUND IT YET THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE AND IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT ONE
4687-43337-0005 FOR PETER THE SPIRITUAL WORLD HAD AN INTERPRETATION AND A GUARANTEE IN THE OUTWARD EVENTS HE HAD WITNESSED HE HAD HANDLED THE RISEN CHRIST THE EXTERNAL CORROBORATED THE INTERNAL
4687-43337-0006 BUT FOR SILVESTER IT WAS NOT SO FOR HIM IT WAS NECESSARY SO TO GRASP SPIRITUAL TRUTHS IN THE SUPERNATURAL SPHERE THAT THE EXTERNAL EVENTS OF THE INCARNATION WERE PROVED BY RATHER THAN PROVED
4687-43337-0007 THE CERTITUDE OF HIS SPIRITUAL APPREHENSION CERTAINLY HISTORICALLY SPEAKING CHRISTIANITY WAS TRUE PROVED BY ITS RECORDS YET TO SEE THAT NEEDED ILLUMINATION HE APPREHENDED THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION
4687-43337-0008 THEREFORE CHRIST WAS RISEN THEREFORE IN HEAVIER MOODS IT WAS DIFFERENT WITH HIM THERE WERE PERIODS LASTING SOMETIMES FOR DAYS TOGETHER CLOUDING HIM WHEN HE AWOKE STIFLING HIM AS HE TRIED TO SLEEP
4687-43337-0009 DULLING THE VERY SAVOUR OF THE SACRAMENT AND THE THRILL OF THE PRECIOUS BLOOD TIMES IN WHICH THE DARKNESS WAS SO INTOLERABLE THAT EVEN THE SOLID OBJECTS OF FAITH ATTENUATED THEMSELVES TO SHADOW
4687-43337-0010 WHEN HALF HIS NATURE WAS BLIND NOT ONLY TO CHRIST BUT TO GOD HIMSELF AND THE REALITY OF HIS OWN EXISTENCE WHEN HIS OWN AWFUL DIGNITY SEEMED AS THE INSIGNIA OF A FOOL
4687-43337-0011 HIS EARTHLY MIND DEMANDED THAT HE AND HIS COLLEGE OF TWELVE AND HIS FEW THOUSANDS SHOULD BE RIGHT AND THE ENTIRE CONSENSUS OF THE CIVILISED WORLD WRONG IT WAS NOT THAT THE WORLD HAD NOT HEARD THE MESSAGE OF THE GOSPEL
4687-43337-0012 IT HAD HEARD LITTLE ELSE FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS AND NOW PRONOUNCED IT FALSE FALSE IN ITS EXTERNAL CREDENTIALS AND FALSE THEREFORE IN ITS SPIRITUAL CLAIMS IT WAS A LOST CAUSE FOR WHICH HE SUFFERED HE WAS NOT THE LAST OF AN AUGUST LINE
4687-43337-0013 HE WAS THE SMOKING WICK OF A CANDLE OF FOLLY HE WAS THE REDUCTIO AD ABSURDAM OF A LUDICROUS SYLLOGISM BASED ON IMPOSSIBLE PREMISES HE WAS NOT WORTH KILLING HE AND HIS COMPANY OF THE INSANE
4687-43337-0014 THEY WERE NO MORE THAN THE CROWNED DUNCES OF THE WORLD'S SCHOOL SANITY SAT ON THE SOLID BENCHES OF MATERIALISM AND THIS HEAVINESS WAXED SO DARK SOMETIMES THAT HE ALMOST PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT HIS FAITH WAS GONE THE CLAMOURS OF MIND SO LOUD
4687-43337-0015 THAT THE WHISPER OF THE HEART WAS UNHEARD THE DESIRES FOR EARTHLY PEACE SO FIERCE THAT SUPERNATURAL AMBITIONS WERE SILENCED SO DENSE WAS THE GLOOM THAT HOPING AGAINST HOPE BELIEVING AGAINST KNOWLEDGE
4687-43337-0016 AND LOVING AGAINST TRUTH HE CRIED AS ONE OTHER HAD CRIED ON ANOTHER DAY LIKE THIS ELI ELI LAMA SABACHTHANI BUT THAT AT LEAST HE NEVER FAILED TO CRY ONE THING ALONE GAVE HIM POWER TO GO ON
4687-43337-0017 SO FAR AT LEAST AS HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS CONCERNED AND THAT WAS HIS MEDITATION HE HAD TRAVELLED FAR IN THE MYSTICAL LIFE SINCE HIS AGONIES OF EFFORT NOW HE USED NO DELIBERATE DESCENTS INTO THE SPIRITUAL WORLD HE THREW AS IT WERE HIS HANDS OVER HIS HEAD
4687-43337-0018 AND DROPPED INTO SPACELESSNESS CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD DRAW HIM UP AS A CORK TO THE SURFACE BUT HE WOULD DO NO MORE THAN REPEAT HIS ACTION UNTIL BY THAT CESSATION OF ACTIVITY WHICH IS THE SUPREME ENERGY HE FLOATED
4687-43337-0019 AND THERE GOD WOULD DEAL WITH HIM NOW BY AN ARTICULATE SENTENCE NOW BY A SWORD OF PAIN NOW BY AN AIR LIKE THE VIVIFYING BREATH OF THE SEA
4687-43337-0020 SOMETIMES AS HE FELL ASLEEP SOMETIMES IN THE WHIRL OF WORK YET HIS CONSCIOUSNESS DID NOT SEEM TO RETAIN FOR LONG SUCH EXPERIENCES FIVE MINUTES LATER IT MIGHT BE
4687-43337-0021 THERE HE LAY THEN IN THE CHAIR REVOLVING THE INTOLERABLE BLASPHEMIES THAT HE HAD READ HIS WHITE HAIR WAS THIN UPON HIS BROWNED TEMPLES HIS HANDS WERE AS THE HANDS OF A SPIRIT AND HIS YOUNG FACE LINED AND PATCHED WITH SORROW
4687-43337-0022 HIS BARE FEET PROTRUDED FROM BENEATH HIS STAINED TUNIC AND HIS OLD BROWN BURNOUS LAY ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM IT WAS AN HOUR BEFORE HE MOVED
4687-43337-0023 WHEN THE STEPS OF THE HORSES SOUNDED IN THE PAVED COURT OUTSIDE THEN HE SAT UP SLIPPED HIS FEET INTO THEIR SHOES AND LIFTED THE BURNOUS FROM THE FLOOR AS THE DOOR OPENED AND THE LEAN SUN BURNED PRIEST CAME THROUGH THE HORSES HOLINESS SAID THE MAN
4687-43337-0024 THE POPE SPOKE NOT ONE WORD THAT AFTERNOON UNTIL THE TWO CAME TOWARDS SUNSET UP THE BRIDLE PATH THAT LEADS BETWEEN THABOR AND NAZARETH THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR USUAL ROUND THROUGH CANA MOUNTING A HILLOCK FROM WHICH THE LONG MIRROR OF GENNESARETH COULD BE SEEN
4687-43337-0025 AND PASSING ON ALWAYS BEARING TO THE RIGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THABOR UNTIL ONCE MORE ESDRAELON SPREAD ITSELF BENEATH LIKE A GREY GREEN CARPET A VAST CIRCLE TWENTY MILES ACROSS SPRINKLED SPARSELY WITH GROUPS OF HUTS
4687-43337-0026 WHITE WALLS AND ROOFS WITH NAIN VISIBLE ON THE OTHER SIDE CARMEL HEAVING ITS LONG FORM FAR OFF ON THE RIGHT AND NAZARETH NESTLING A MILE OR TWO AWAY ON THE PLATEAU ON WHICH THEY HAD HALTED
4687-43337-0027 IT WAS A SIGHT OF EXTRAORDINARY PEACE AND SEEMED AN EXTRACT FROM SOME OLD PICTURE BOOK DESIGNED CENTURIES AGO HERE WAS NO CROWD OF ROOFS NO PRESSURE OF HOT HUMANITY
4687-43337-0028 NO TERRIBLE EVIDENCES OF CIVILISATION AND MANUFACTORY AND STRENUOUS FRUITLESS EFFORT A FEW TIRED JEWS HAD COME BACK TO THIS QUIET LITTLE LAND AS OLD PEOPLE MAY RETURN TO THEIR NATIVE PLACE WITH NO HOPE OF RENEWING THEIR YOUTH
4687-43337-0029 AND A FEW MORE BARRACK LIKE HOUSES HAD BEEN ADDED HERE AND THERE TO THE OBSCURE VILLAGES IN SIGHT BUT IT WAS VERY MUCH AS IT HAD BEEN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE PLAIN WAS HALF SHADOWED BY CARMEL AND HALF IN DUSTY GOLDEN LIGHT
4687-43337-0030 OVERHEAD THE CLEAR EASTERN SKY WAS FLUSHED WITH ROSE AS IT HAD FLUSHED FOR ABRAHAM JACOB AND THE SON OF DAVID THERE WAS NO LITTLE CLOUD HERE AS A MAN'S HAND OVER THE SEA CHARGED WITH BOTH PROMISE AND TERROR
4687-43337-0031 NO SOUND OF CHARIOT WHEELS FROM EARTH OR HEAVEN NO VISION OF HEAVENLY HORSES SUCH AS A YOUNG MAN HAD SEEN THIRTY CENTURIES AGO IN THIS VERY SKY HERE WAS THE OLD EARTH AND THE OLD HEAVEN UNCHANGED AND UNCHANGEABLE
4687-43337-0032 THE PATIENT RETURNING SPRING HAD STARRED THE THIN SOIL WITH FLOWERS OF BETHLEHEM AND THOSE GLORIOUS LILIES TO WHICH SOLOMON'S SCARLET GARMENTS MIGHT NOT BE COMPARED THERE WAS NO WHISPER FROM THE THRONE
4687-43337-0033 AS WHEN GABRIEL HAD ONCE STOOPED THROUGH THIS VERY AIR TO HAIL HER WHO WAS BLESSED AMONG WOMEN NO BREATH OF PROMISE OR HOPE BEYOND THAT WHICH GOD SENDS THROUGH EVERY MOVEMENT OF HIS CREATED ROBE OF LIFE
4687-43337-0034 AS THE TWO HALTED AND THE HORSES LOOKED OUT WITH STEADY INQUISITIVE EYES AT THE IMMENSITY OF LIGHT AND AIR BENEATH THEM A SOFT HOOTING CRY BROKE OUT AND A SHEPHERD PASSED BELOW ALONG THE HILLSIDE A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY TRAILING HIS LONG SHADOW BEHIND HIM
4687-43337-0035 AND TO THE MELLOW TINKLE OF BELLS HIS FLOCK CAME AFTER A TROOP OF OBEDIENT SHEEP AND WILFUL GOATS CROPPING AND FOLLOWING AND CROPPING AGAIN AS THEY WENT ON TO THE FOLD CALLED BY NAME IN THAT SAD MINOR VOICE OF HIM WHO KNEW EACH
4687-43337-0036 AND LED INSTEAD OF DRIVING THE SOFT CLANKING GREW FAINTER THE SHADOW OF THE SHEPHERD
4687-43337-0037 AS HE TOPPED THE RISE AND VANISHED AGAIN AS HE STEPPED DOWN ONCE MORE AND THE CALL GREW FAINTER YET AND CEASED THE POPE LIFTED HIS HAND TO HIS EYES FOR AN INSTANT THEN SMOOTHED IT DOWN HIS FACE
4687-43337-0038 HE NODDED ACROSS TO A DIM PATCH OF WHITE WALLS GLIMMERING THROUGH THE VIOLET HAZE OF THE FALLING TWILIGHT THAT PLACE FATHER HE SAID WHAT IS ITS NAME THE SYRIAN PRIEST LOOKED ACROSS BACK ONCE MORE AT THE POPE
4687-43337-0039 AND ACROSS AGAIN THAT AMONG THE PALMS HOLINESS YES THAT IS MEGIDDO HE SAID
