1717-142305-0000 BUT SHE HAD NO TIME TO GIVE WAY TO REGULAR CRYING THE FATHER AND BROTHER DEPENDED UPON HER WHILE THEY WERE GIVING WAY TO GRIEF SHE MUST BE WORKING PLANNING CONSIDERING EVEN THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUNERAL SEEMED TO DEVOLVE UPON HER
1717-142305-0001 WHEN THE FIRE WAS BRIGHT AND CRACKLING WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR BREAKFAST AND THE TEA KETTLE WAS SINGING AWAY MARGARET GAVE A LAST LOOK ROUND THE ROOM BEFORE GOING TO SUMMON MISTER HALE AND FREDERICK SHE WANTED EVERYTHING TO LOOK AS CHEERFUL AS POSSIBLE
1717-142305-0002 AND YET WHEN IT DID SO THE CONTRAST BETWEEN IT AND HER OWN THOUGHTS FORCED HER INTO SUDDEN WEEPING SHE WAS KNEELING BY THE SOFA HIDING HER FACE IN THE CUSHIONS THAT NO ONE MIGHT HEAR HER CRY WHEN SHE WAS TOUCHED ON THE SHOULDER BY DIXON
1717-142305-0003 COME MISS HALE COME MY DEAR YOU MUST NOT GIVE WAY OR WHERE SHALL WE ALL BE THERE IS NOT ANOTHER PERSON IN THE HOUSE FIT TO GIVE A DIRECTION OF ANY KIND AND THERE IS SO MUCH TO BE DONE
1717-142305-0004 AND ALL TO BE SETTLED AND MASTER FREDERICK'S LIKE ONE CRAZED WITH CRYING
1717-142305-0005 AND POOR GENTLEMAN HE GOES ABOUT NOW AS IF HE WAS LOST IT'S BAD ENOUGH MY DEAR I KNOW BUT DEATH COMES TO US ALL
1717-142305-0006 PERHAPS SO BUT THIS SEEMED A LOSS BY ITSELF NOT TO BEAR COMPARISON WITH ANY OTHER EVENT IN THE WORLD MARGARET DID NOT TAKE ANY COMFORT FROM WHAT DIXON SAID BUT THE UNUSUAL TENDERNESS OF THE PRIM OLD SERVANT'S MANNER
1717-142305-0007 AND MORE FROM A DESIRE TO SHOW HER GRATITUDE FOR THIS THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON SHE ROUSED HERSELF UP
1717-142305-0008 MISTER HALE CAME AS IF IN A DREAM OR RATHER WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS MOTION OF A SLEEP WALKER WHOSE EYES AND MIND PERCEIVE OTHER THINGS THAN WHAT ARE PRESENT FREDERICK CAME BRISKLY IN WITH A FORCED CHEERFULNESS
1717-142305-0009 GRASPED HER HAND LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND BURST INTO TEARS SHE HAD TO TRY AND THINK OF LITTLE NOTHINGS TO SAY ALL BREAKFAST TIME IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF HER COMPANIONS THOUGHTS TOO STRONGLY TO THE LAST MEAL THEY HAD TAKEN TOGETHER
1717-142305-0010 WHEN THERE HAD BEEN A CONTINUAL STRAINED LISTENING FOR SOME SOUND OR SIGNAL FROM THE SICK ROOM AFTER BREAKFAST
1717-142305-0011 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND ASSENTED TO ALL SHE PROPOSED THOUGH MANY OF HER PROPOSITIONS ABSOLUTELY CONTRADICTED ONE ANOTHER MARGARET GAINED NO REAL DECISION FROM HIM AND WAS LEAVING THE ROOM LANGUIDLY TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH DIXON
1717-142305-0012 WHEN MISTER HALE MOTIONED HER BACK TO HIS SIDE ASK MISTER BELL SAID HE IN A HOLLOW VOICE MISTER BELL SAID SHE A LITTLE SURPRISED MISTER BELL OF OXFORD MISTER BELL HE REPEATED
1717-142305-0013 YES HE WAS MY GROOM'S MAN MARGARET UNDERSTOOD THE ASSOCIATION I WILL WRITE TO DAY SAID SHE HE SANK AGAIN INTO LISTLESSNESS ALL MORNING SHE TOILED ON LONGING FOR REST BUT IN A CONTINUAL WHIRL
1717-142305-0014 OF MELANCHOLY BUSINESS TOWARDS EVENING DIXON SAID TO HER I'VE DONE IT MISS I WAS REALLY AFRAID FOR MASTER THAT HE'D HAVE A STROKE WITH GRIEF HE'S BEEN ALL THIS DAY WITH POOR MISSUS AND WHEN I'VE LISTENED AT THE DOOR I'VE HEARD HIM TALKING TO HER
1717-142305-0015 AND TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE WAS ALIVE WHEN I WENT IN HE WOULD BE QUITE QUIET BUT ALL IN A MAZE LIKE
1717-142305-0016 AND I DON'T IT WAS ONLY ON TUESDAY
1717-142305-0017 I MET A SOUTHAMPTON MAN THE FIRST I'VE SEEN SINCE I CAME TO MILTON
1717-142305-0018 IT WAS YOUNG LEONARDS OLD LEONARDS THE DRAPER'S SON AS GREAT A SCAMP AS EVER LIVED WHO PLAGUED HIS FATHER ALMOST TO DEATH AND THEN RAN OFF TO SEA I NEVER COULD ABIDE HIM
1717-142305-0019 THOUGH I DON'T RECOLLECT IF HE WAS THERE AT THE MUTINY DID HE KNOW YOU SAID MARGARET EAGERLY WHY THAT'S THE WORST OF IT
1717-142305-0020 A NASTY GOOD FOR NOTHING FELLOW SAYS HE MISS DIXON WHO WOULD HA THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU HERE BUT PERHAPS I MISTAKE AND YOU'RE MISS DIXON NO LONGER SO I TOLD HIM HE MIGHT STILL ADDRESS ME AS AN UNMARRIED LADY THOUGH IF I HADN'T BEEN SO PARTICULAR
1717-142305-0021 I'D HAD GOOD CHANCES OF MATRIMONY
1717-142305-0022 AND BY WAY OF BEING EVEN I ASKED HIM AFTER HIS FATHER
1717-142305-0023 AS IF THEY WAS THE BEST FRIENDS AS EVER WAS
1717-142305-0024 MISS DIXON WE'LL GO PARTNERS IN THE REWARD I KNOW YOU'D LIKE TO BE MY PARTNER NOW WOULDN'T YOU
1717-142305-0025 MARGARET WAS MADE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BY THIS ACCOUNT OF DIXON'S HAVE YOU TOLD FREDERICK ASKED SHE NO SAID DIXON
1717-142305-0026 I THOUGHT IT MIGHT ROUSE HIM TO HAVE TO THINK OF MASTER FREDERICK'S SAFETY A BIT SO I TOLD HIM ALL
1717-142305-0027 AND IT HAS DONE MASTER GOOD AND IF WE'RE TO KEEP MASTER FREDERICK IN HIDING HE WOULD HAVE TO GO POOR FELLOW BEFORE MISTER BELL CAME
1717-142305-0028 AND FOR ALL HE SAID HE'D GOT A CONFIDENTIAL SITUATION
1717-142305-0029 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT FREDERICK MUST GO GO TOO WHEN HE HAD SO COMPLETELY VAULTED INTO HIS PLACE IN THE FAMILY AND PROMISED TO BE SUCH A STAY AND STAFF TO HIS FATHER AND SISTER GO WHEN HIS CARES FOR THE LIVING MOTHER
1717-142305-0030 AND SORROW FOR THE DEAD SEEMED TO MAKE HIM ONE OF THOSE PECULIAR PEOPLE WHO ARE BOUND TO US BY A FELLOW LOVE FOR THEM THAT ARE TAKEN AWAY JUST AS MARGARET WAS THINKING ALL THIS SITTING OVER THE DRAWING ROOM FIRE
1717-142305-0031 HER FATHER RESTLESS AND UNEASY UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THIS NEWLY AROUSED FEAR OF WHICH HE HAD NOT AS YET SPOKEN FREDERICK CAME IN HIS BRIGHTNESS DIMMED BUT THE EXTREME VIOLENCE OF HIS GRIEF PASSED AWAY HE CAME UP TO MARGARET
1717-142305-0032 AND KISSED HER FOREHEAD HOW WAN YOU LOOK MARGARET SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE YOU HAVE BEEN THINKING OF EVERYBODY AND NO ONE HAS THOUGHT OF YOU LIE ON THIS SOFA THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU TO DO
1717-142305-0033 I SHOULD JUST LIKE TO HAVE IT OUT WITH THAT YOUNG FELLOW A
1717-142305-0034 I DECLARE MARGARET YOU KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR YES MAMMA TOLD ME WELL
1717-142305-0035 WERE INDIGNANT WITH OUR CAPTAIN THIS FELLOW TO CURRY FAVOUR PAH AND TO THINK OF HIS BEING HERE OH IF HE'D A NOTION I WAS WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF HIM HE'D FERRET ME OUT TO PAY OFF OLD GRUDGES I'D RATHER ANYBODY HAD THE HUNDRED POUNDS THEY THINK I AM WORTH THAN THAT RASCAL
1717-142305-0036 WHAT A PITY POOR OLD DIXON COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO GIVE ME UP AND MAKE A PROVISION FOR HER OLD AGE OH FREDERICK HUSH DON'T TALK SO MISTER HALE CAME TOWARDS THEM EAGER AND TREMBLING HE HAD OVERHEARD WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
1717-142305-0037 HE TOOK FREDERICK'S HAND IN BOTH OF HIS MY BOY YOU MUST GO IT IS VERY BAD BUT I SEE YOU MUST YOU HAVE DONE ALL YOU COULD YOU HAVE BEEN A COMFORT TO HER
1717-142305-0038 OH PAPA MUST HE GO SAID MARGARET PLEADING AGAINST HER OWN CONVICTION OF NECESSITY I DECLARE I'VE A GOOD MIND TO FACE IT OUT AND STAND MY TRIAL IF I COULD ONLY PICK UP MY EVIDENCE
1717-142305-0039 I COULD ALMOST HAVE ENJOYED
1717-142305-0040 AND OFF YOU WENT A ROBBING YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED YOUR FEELINGS MUCH SINCE THEN YES YOU MUST GO
1717-142305-0041 WHICH SHE HAD ASKED SOME TIME AGO HIS THOUGHTS WERE FIXED ON ONE SUBJECT AND IT WAS AN EFFORT TO HIM TO FOLLOW THE ZIG ZAG REMARKS OF HIS CHILDREN AN EFFORT WHICH HE DID NOT MAKE MARGARET AND FREDERICK LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
1717-142305-0042 THAT QUICK MOMENTARY SYMPATHY WOULD BE THEIRS NO LONGER IF HE WENT AWAY SO MUCH WAS UNDERSTOOD THROUGH EYES THAT COULD NOT BE PUT INTO WORDS BOTH COURSED THE SAME THOUGHT TILL IT WAS LOST IN SADNESS FREDERICK SHOOK IT OFF FIRST DO YOU KNOW MARGARET
1717-142305-0043 I SAW DIXON COMING DOWNSTAIRS AND SHE FROWNED AND KICKED ME INTO HIDING AGAIN I KEPT THE DOOR OPEN AND HEARD A MESSAGE GIVEN TO SOME MAN THAT WAS IN MY FATHER'S STUDY AND THAT THEN WENT AWAY WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE SHOPMEN
1717-142305-0044 VERY LIKELY SAID MARGARET INDIFFERENTLY
1717-142305-0045 SAID MISTER HALE THEY WERE GLAD TO HAVE DRAWN HIM INTO THE CONVERSATION MISTER THORNTON SAID MARGARET A LITTLE SURPRISED I THOUGHT WELL LITTLE ONE WHAT DID YOU THINK ASKED FREDERICK AS SHE DID NOT FINISH HER SENTENCE
1717-142305-0046 OH ONLY SAID SHE REDDENING AND LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM I FANCIED YOU MEANT SOME ONE OF A DIFFERENT CLASS NOT A GENTLEMAN SOMEBODY COME ON AN ERRAND HE LOOKED LIKE SOME ONE OF THAT KIND SAID FREDERICK CARELESSLY
1717-142305-0047 MARGARET WAS SILENT SHE REMEMBERED HOW AT FIRST BEFORE SHE KNEW HIS CHARACTER SHE HAD SPOKEN AND THOUGHT OF HIM JUST AS FREDERICK WAS DOING IT WAS BUT A NATURAL IMPRESSION THAT WAS MADE UPON HIM AND YET SHE WAS A LITTLE ANNOYED BY IT
1717-142305-0048 SHE WAS UNWILLING TO SPEAK SHE WANTED TO MAKE FREDERICK UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF PERSON MISTER THORNTON WAS BUT SHE WAS TONGUE TIED MISTER HALE WENT ON HE CAME TO OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE IN HIS POWER I BELIEVE BUT I COULD NOT SEE HIM
1717-142305-0049 I TOLD DIXON TO ASK HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU I THINK I ASKED HER TO FIND YOU
1717-142305-0050 HE HAS BEEN A VERY AGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE HAS HE NOT ASKED FREDERICK THROWING THE QUESTION LIKE A BALL FOR ANY ONE TO CATCH WHO CHOSE A VERY KIND FRIEND
1717-142305-0051 SAID MARGARET WHEN HER FATHER DID NOT ANSWER FREDERICK WAS SILENT FOR A TIME AT LAST HE SPOKE MARGARET IT IS PAINFUL TO THINK I CAN NEVER THANK THOSE WHO HAVE SHOWN YOU KINDNESS
1717-142305-0052 YOUR ACQUAINTANCES AND MINE MUST BE SEPARATE UNLESS INDEED I RUN THE CHANCES OF A COURT MARTIAL
1717-142305-0053 YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I WISH YOU WOULD I HAVE A GOOD POSITION THE CHANCE OF A BETTER CONTINUED HE REDDENING LIKE A GIRL
1717-142305-0054 I ONLY WISH YOU KNEW HER I AM SURE YOU WOULD LIKE NO LOVE IS THE RIGHT WORD LIKE IS SO POOR YOU WOULD LOVE HER FATHER IF YOU KNEW HER SHE IS NOT EIGHTEEN
1717-142305-0055 BUT IF SHE IS IN THE SAME MIND ANOTHER YEAR SHE IS TO BE MY WIFE MISTER BARBOUR WON'T LET US CALL IT AN ENGAGEMENT BUT IF YOU WOULD COME YOU WOULD FIND FRIENDS EVERYWHERE BESIDES DOLORES THINK OF IT FATHER MARGARET BE ON MY SIDE
1717-142305-0056 NO NO MORE REMOVALS FOR ME SAID MISTER HALE ONE REMOVAL HAS COST ME MY WIFE
1717-142305-0057 OH FREDERICK SAID MARGARET TELL US MORE ABOUT HER I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS BUT I AM SO GLAD YOU WILL HAVE SOME ONE TO LOVE AND CARE FOR YOU OUT THERE TELL US ALL ABOUT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE IS A ROMAN CATHOLIC
1717-142305-0058 BUT MY FATHER'S CHANGE OF OPINION NAY MARGARET DON'T SIGH
1717-142305-0059 FREDERICK HIMSELF WAS ROMAN CATHOLIC IN FACT THOUGH NOT IN PROFESSION AS YET THIS WAS THEN THE REASON WHY HIS SYMPATHY IN HER EXTREME DISTRESS AT HER FATHER'S LEAVING THE CHURCH HAD BEEN SO FAINTLY EXPRESSED IN HIS LETTERS
1717-142305-0060 OF A SAILOR BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT EVEN THEN HE WAS HIMSELF INCLINED TO GIVE UP THE FORM OF RELIGION INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN BAPTISED
1717-142305-0061 HOW MUCH LOVE HAD TO DO WITH THIS CHANGE NOT EVEN FREDERICK HIMSELF COULD HAVE TOLD MARGARET GAVE UP TALKING ABOUT THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT AT LAST AND RETURNING TO THE FACT OF THE ENGAGEMENT SHE BEGAN TO CONSIDER IT IN SOME FRESH LIGHT
1717-142305-0062 BUT FOR HER SAKE FRED
1717-142305-0063 IF THERE WERE TO BE A COURT MARTIAL AND YOU COULD FIND YOUR WITNESSES YOU MIGHT AT ANY RATE SHOW HOW YOUR DISOBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY WAS BECAUSE THAT AUTHORITY WAS UNWORTHILY EXERCISED
1717-142305-0064 IN THE FIRST PLACE MARGARET WHO IS TO HUNT UP MY WITNESSES ALL OF THEM ARE SAILORS DRAFTED OFF TO OTHER SHIPS EXCEPT THOSE WHOSE EVIDENCE WOULD GO FOR VERY LITTLE AS THEY TOOK PART OR SYMPATHISED IN THE AFFAIR IN THE NEXT PLACE
1717-142305-0065 ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A COURT MARTIAL IS AND CONSIDER IT AS AN ASSEMBLY WHERE JUSTICE IS ADMINISTERED INSTEAD OF WHAT IT REALLY IS A COURT
1717-142305-0066 EVIDENCE ITSELF CAN HARDLY ESCAPE BEING INFLUENCED BY THE PRESTIGE OF AUTHORITY BUT IS IT NOT WORTH TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH EVIDENCE MIGHT BE DISCOVERED AND ARRAYED ON YOUR BEHALF AT PRESENT
1717-142305-0067 ALL THOSE WHO KNEW YOU FORMERLY BELIEVE YOU GUILTY WITHOUT ANY SHADOW OF EXCUSE
1717-142305-0068 AND WE HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHERE TO SEEK FOR PROOFS OF YOUR JUSTIFICATION NOW FOR MISS BARBOUR'S SAKE MAKE YOUR CONDUCT AS CLEAR AS YOU CAN IN THE EYE OF THE WORLD SHE MAY NOT CARE FOR IT SHE HAS I AM SURE
1717-142305-0069 YOU DISOBEYED AUTHORITY THAT WAS BAD BUT TO HAVE STOOD BY WITHOUT WORD OR ACT WHILE THE AUTHORITY WAS BRUTALLY USED WOULD HAVE BEEN INFINITELY WORSE
1717-142305-0070 BUT NOT THE MOTIVES THAT ELEVATE IT OUT OF A CRIME INTO AN HEROIC PROTECTION OF THE WEAK FOR DOLORES SAKE THEY OUGHT TO KNOW BUT HOW MUST I MAKE THEM KNOW
1717-142305-0071 WHO WOULD BE MY JUDGES TO GIVE MYSELF UP TO A COURT MARTIAL EVEN IF I COULD BRING A WHOLE ARRAY OF TRUTH SPEAKING WITNESSES
1717-142305-0072 MY HEROISM NO ONE WOULD READ A PAMPHLET OF SELF JUSTIFICATION SO LONG AFTER THE DEED EVEN IF I PUT ONE OUT WILL YOU CONSULT A LAWYER AS TO YOUR CHANCES OF EXCULPATION ASKED MARGARET LOOKING UP AND TURNING VERY RED
1717-142305-0073 BEFORE I MAKE HIM INTO MY CONFIDANT
1717-142305-0074 A HUNDRED POUNDS VERY EASILY BY DOING A GOOD ACTION
1717-142305-0075 UP TO JUSTICE NONSENSE FREDERICK BECAUSE I KNOW A LAWYER ON WHOSE HONOUR I CAN RELY OF WHOSE CLEVERNESS IN HIS PROFESSION PEOPLE SPEAK VERY HIGHLY AND WHO WOULD I THINK
1717-142305-0076 AUNT SHAW'S RELATIONS MISTER HENRY LENNOX PAPA
1717-142305-0077 SAID MISTER HALE BUT DON'T PROPOSE ANYTHING WHICH WILL DETAIN FREDERICK IN ENGLAND DON'T FOR YOUR MOTHER'S SAKE
1717-142305-0078 HE MUST GO TO MORROW I'M AFRAID PAPA SAID SHE TENDERLY WE FIXED THAT BECAUSE OF MISTER BELL AND DIXON'S DISAGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE YES I MUST GO TO MORROW SAID FREDERICK DECIDEDLY
1717-142305-0079 MISTER HALE GROANED I CAN'T BEAR TO PART WITH YOU
1717-142305-0080 WELL THEN SAID MARGARET LISTEN TO MY PLAN HE GETS TO LONDON ON FRIDAY MORNING I WILL YOU MIGHT NO IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO GIVE HIM A NOTE TO MISTER LENNOX YOU WILL FIND HIM AT HIS CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPLE
1717-142305-0081 I WILL WRITE DOWN A LIST OF ALL THE NAMES I CAN REMEMBER ON BOARD THE ORION I COULD LEAVE IT WITH HIM TO FERRET THEM OUT HE IS EDITH'S HUSBAND'S BROTHER ISN'T HE I REMEMBER YOUR NAMING HIM IN YOUR LETTERS I HAVE MONEY IN BARBOUR'S HANDS
1717-142305-0082 MONEY DEAR FATHER THAT I HAD MEANT FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE
1717-142305-0083 DON'T DO THAT SAID MARGARET YOU WON'T RISK IT IF YOU DO AND IT WILL BE A RISK ONLY IT IS WORTH TRYING YOU CAN SAIL FROM LONDON AS WELL AS FROM LIVERPOOL TO BE SURE LITTLE GOOSE
1717-142305-0084 WHEREVER I FEEL WATER HEAVING UNDER A PLANK THERE I FEEL AT HOME
1717-142305-0085 AWAY FROM YOU ON THE ONE HAND
