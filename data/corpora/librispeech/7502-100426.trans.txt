7502-100426-0000 THE CHARM OF GOLF WHEN HE READS OF THE NOTABLE DOINGS OF FAMOUS GOLFERS THE EIGHTEEN HANDICAP MAN HAS NO ENVY IN HIS HEART FOR BY THIS TIME HE HAS DISCOVERED THE GREAT SECRET OF GOLF
7502-100426-0001 BEFORE HE BEGAN TO PLAY HE WONDERED WHEREIN LAY THE FASCINATION OF IT NOW HE KNOWS GOLF IS SO POPULAR SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD AT WHICH TO BE BAD CONSIDER WHAT IT IS TO BE BAD AT CRICKET
7502-100426-0002 YOU HAVE BOUGHT A NEW BAT PERFECT IN BALANCE
7502-100426-0003 GLOVES OF THE VERY LATEST DESIGN DO THEY LET YOU USE THEM NO AFTER ONE BALL IN THE NEGOTIATION OF WHICH NEITHER YOUR BAT NOR YOUR PADS NOR YOUR GLOVES CAME INTO PLAY THEY SEND YOU BACK INTO THE PAVILION TO SPEND THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON
7502-100426-0004 LISTENING TO FATUOUS STORIES OF SOME OLD GENTLEMAN WHO KNEW FULLER PILCH AND WHEN YOUR SIDE TAKES THE FIELD
7502-100426-0005 PROBABLY AT LONG LEG BOTH ENDS EXPOSED TO THE PUBLIC GAZE AS THE WORST FIELDSMAN IN LONDON HOW DEVASTATING ARE YOUR EMOTIONS REMORSE ANGER MORTIFICATION FILL YOUR HEART ABOVE ALL ENVY
7502-100426-0006 ENVY OF THE LUCKY IMMORTALS WHO DISPORT THEMSELVES ON THE GREEN LEVEL OF LORD'S CONSIDER WHAT IT IS TO BE BAD AT LAWN TENNIS TRUE
7502-100426-0007 HOW OFTEN DOES YOUR PARTNER CRY
7502-100426-0008 IS THERE PLEASURE IN PLAYING FOOTBALL BADLY YOU MAY SPEND THE FULL EIGHTY MINUTES IN YOUR NEW BOOTS
7502-100426-0009 THEY DO NOT GIVE YOU A BALL TO YOURSELF AT FOOTBALL BUT HOW DIFFERENT A GAME IS GOLF AT GOLF IT IS THE BAD PLAYER WHO GETS THE MOST STROKES HOWEVER GOOD HIS OPPONENT THE BAD PLAYER HAS THE RIGHT TO PLAY OUT EACH HOLE TO THE END
7502-100426-0010 HE WILL GET MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF THE GAME HE NEED HAVE NO FEARS THAT HIS NEW DRIVER WILL NOT BE EMPLOYED HE WILL HAVE AS MANY SWINGS WITH IT AS THE SCRATCH MAN MORE IF HE MISSES THE BALL ALTOGETHER UPON ONE OR TWO TEES IF HE BUYS A NEW NIBLICK
7502-100426-0011 AND ABOVE ALL THERE IS THIS TO BE SAID FOR GOLFING MEDIOCRITY THE BAD PLAYER CAN MAKE THE STROKES OF THE GOOD PLAYER THE POOR CRICKETER HAS PERHAPS NEVER MADE FIFTY IN HIS LIFE AS SOON AS HE STANDS AT THE WICKETS
7502-100426-0012 BUT THE EIGHTEEN HANDICAP MAN HAS SOME TIME OR OTHER PLAYED EVERY HOLE ON THE COURSE TO PERFECTION
7502-100426-0013 HE HAS MADE SUPERB APPROACHES HE HAS RUN DOWN THE LONG PUTT ANY OF THESE THINGS MAY SUDDENLY HAPPEN TO HIM AGAIN
7502-100426-0014 AND LISTEN TO THE WONDERFUL DEEDS OF OTHERS HE CAN JOIN IN TOO HE CAN SAY WITH PERFECT TRUTH I ONCE CARRIED THE DITCH AT THE FOURTH WITH MY SECOND OR I REMEMBER WHEN I DROVE INTO THE BUNKER GUARDING THE EIGHTH GREEN OR EVEN
7502-100426-0015 BOGEY BEING FIVE BUT IF THE BAD CRICKETER SAYS I REMEMBER WHEN I TOOK A CENTURY IN FORTY MINUTES OFF LOCKWOOD AND RICHARDSON HE IS NOTHING BUT A LIAR FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS GOLF IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD FOR THE BAD PLAYER
7502-100426-0016 THE JOY OF DRIVING A BALL STRAIGHT AFTER A WEEK OF SLICING THE JOY OF PUTTING A MASHIE SHOT DEAD THE JOY OF EVEN A MODERATE STROKE WITH A BRASSIE BEST OF ALL THE JOY OF THE PERFECT CLEEK SHOT THESE THINGS THE GOOD PLAYER WILL NEVER KNOW
7502-100426-0017 EVERY STROKE WE BAD PLAYERS MAKE WE MAKE IN HOPE
7502-100426-0018 AND IF THE NEXT STROKE IS GOOD WHAT HAPPINESS FILLS OUR SOUL HOW EAGERLY WE TELL OURSELVES THAT IN A LITTLE WHILE ALL OUR STROKES WILL BE AS GOOD WHAT DOES VARDON KNOW OF THIS IF HE DOES A FIVE HOLE IN FOUR HE BLAMES HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT DO IT IN THREE
7502-100426-0019 IF HE DOES IT IN FIVE HE IS MISERABLE HE WILL NEVER EXPERIENCE THAT HAPPY SURPRISE WITH WHICH WE HAIL OUR BEST STROKES ONLY HIS BAD STROKES SURPRISE HIM AND THEN WE MAY SUPPOSE THAT HE IS NOT HAPPY HIS LENGTH AND ACCURACY ARE MECHANICAL
7502-100426-0020 OR SOME SUDDENLY DISCOVERED INNOVATION THE ONLY THING WHICH CAN VARY IN HIS GAME IS HIS PUTTING AND PUTTING IS NOT GOLF BUT CROQUET BUT OF COURSE WE TOO ARE GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS VARDON ONE DAY
7502-100426-0021 AND IT IS PART OF THE CHARM OF BEING BAD AT GOLF THAT IN A MOMENT IN A SINGLE NIGHT WE MAY BECOME GOOD IF THE BAD CRICKETER SAID TO A GOOD CRICKETER WHAT AM I DOING WRONG THE ONLY POSSIBLE ANSWER WOULD BE NOTHING PARTICULAR EXCEPT THAT YOU CAN'T PLAY CRICKET
7502-100426-0022 BUT IF YOU OR I WERE TO SAY TO OUR SCRATCH FRIEND WHAT AM I DOING WRONG HE WOULD REPLY AT ONCE MOVING THE HEAD OR DROPPING THE RIGHT KNEE OR NOT GETTING THE WRISTS IN SOON ENOUGH AND BY TO MORROW WE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT PLAYERS
7502-100426-0023 UPON SUCH A LITTLE DEPENDS OR SEEMS TO THE EIGHTEEN HANDICAP TO DEPEND EXCELLENCE IN GOLF AND SO PERFECTLY HAPPY IN OUR PRESENT BADNESS AND PERFECTLY CONFIDENT OF OUR FUTURE GOODNESS WE LONG HANDICAP MEN REMAIN
7502-100426-0024 PERHAPS IT WOULD BE PLEASANTER TO BE A LITTLE MORE CERTAIN OF GETTING THE BALL SAFELY OFF THE FIRST TEE PERHAPS AT THE FOURTEENTH HOLE WHERE THERE IS A RIGHT OF WAY AND THE PUBLIC ENCROACH WE SHOULD LIKE TO FEEL THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH TOPPING PERHAPS
