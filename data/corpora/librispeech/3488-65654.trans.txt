3488-65654-0000 I MADE A STATEMENT A RATHER LAME ONE I FEAR I CONCEALED THE FACT THAT THE LADY OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S CONFERENCE WAS MY WIFE AND EXPLAINED MY VISIT TO STAMFORD AND MY INQUIRIES AT THE GEORGE BY THE FACT THAT I HAD MET THE MAN LEWIS ABROAD
3488-65654-0001 AND HAD HAD SOME FINANCIAL DEALINGS WITH HIM WHICH I NOW SUSPECTED WERE NOT ALTOGETHER SQUARE SO HEARING THAT HE HAD MOTORED TO THE NORTH
3488-65654-0002 HAPPILY HOWEVER SHE HAD NOT ACCOMPANIED ME HENCE I WAS ABLE TO CONCOCT A SOMEWHAT PLAUSIBLE EXCUSE TO THE LOCAL SUPERINTENDENT THEN YOU ACTUALLY KNOW NOTHING CONCERNING THESE PEOPLE HE ASKED
3488-65654-0003 REGARDING ME SHREWDLY NOTHING BEYOND THE FACT OF MEETING LEWIS ABROAD AND VERY FOOLISHLY TRUSTING IN HIS HONESTY THE SUPERINTENDENT SMILED I THINK HE REGARDED ME AS A BIT OF A FOOL PROBABLY I HAD BEEN
3488-65654-0004 THE ARCHDUCHESS'S NECKLACE MUST HAVE BEEN STOLEN BY SOME ONE TRAVELLING IN THE TRAIN I'VE BEEN ON TO SCOTLAND YARD BY TELEPHONE AND THERE SEEMS A SUSPICION BECAUSE AT GRANTHAM THE LAST STOPPING PLACE BEFORE LONDON A TICKET COLLECTOR BOARDED THE TRAIN
3488-65654-0005 AS IS SOMETIMES DONE AND AT FINSBURY PARK DESCENDED AND WAS LOST SIGHT OF HERE AGAIN THE BUSY COLLECTORS CAME AND DEMANDED TICKETS MUCH TO THE SURPRISE OF THE PASSENGERS AND THE CURIOUS INCIDENT WAS MUCH COMMENTED UPON
3488-65654-0006 THEN THE BOGUS COLLECTOR WAS THE THIEF I SUPPOSE NO DOUBT HE SOMEHOW SECURED THE DRESSING BAG AND DROPPED IT OUT AT A POINT BETWEEN GRANTHAM AND ESSENDINE
3488-65654-0007 A SPOT WHERE HE KNEW HIS ACCOMPLICES WOULD BE WAITING A VERY NEATLY PLANNED ROBBERY AND BY PERSONS WHO ARE EVIDENTLY EXPERTS I SAID OF COURSE REPLIED THE GREY HAIRED SUPERINTENDENT
3488-65654-0008 THE MANNER IN WHICH THE DIAMONDS HAVE BEEN QUICKLY TRANSFERRED FROM HAND TO HAND AND CARRIED OUT OF THE COUNTRY IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF THAT THE GANG HAVE NOW SCATTERED AND FOR AUGHT WE KNOW HAVE ALL CROSSED THE CHANNEL BY THIS TIME WELL I ASSURED HIM
3488-65654-0009 I KNOW NOTHING MORE OF THE AFFAIR THAN WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU IF I WERE AN ACCOMPLICE I SHOULD HARDLY BE HERE MAKING INQUIRIES CONCERNING THEM I DON'T KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THAT HE REPLIED RATHER INCREDULOUSLY
3488-65654-0010 SUCH AN ACTION HAS BEEN KNOWN BEFORE IN ORDER TO PLACE THE POLICE UPON A WRONG SCENT I FEAR I MUST ASK YOU TO REMAIN HERE IN STAMFORD UNTIL THIS EVENING WHILE I MAKE SOME INQUIRY INTO YOUR BONA FIDES SIR
3488-65654-0011 PROVIDING YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LEAVE IT
3488-65654-0012 I CAN ONLY EXPRESS APOLOGIES SIR BUT YOU WILL SEE IT IS MY DUTY YOU HAVE ADMITTED KNOWLEDGE OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE MYSTERIOUS GANG VERY WELL I REPLIED RELUCTANTLY MAKE WHAT INQUIRIES YOU WILL
3488-65654-0013 AND I GAVE HIM THE ADDRESS OF MY SOLICITORS AND MY BANKERS
3488-65654-0014 THEN WALKING OUT OF THE OFFICE I STROLLED DOWN THE QUIET OLD HIGH STREET INTO THE MARKET PLACE FULL OF EVIL FOREBODINGS WHO WAS THIS MAN LEWIS OR LOUIS WITH WHOM MY WIFE HAD ESCAPED HE WAS A BLACKGUARDLY ADVENTURER ANYHOW
3488-65654-0015 HE HAD ADDRESSED HER AS DEAR AND HAD BEEN SOLICITOUS OF HER WELFARE THROUGHOUT TO HIM SHE HAD SIGNALLED FROM HER BOX IN THE THEATRE
3488-65654-0016 INDEED SHE HAD WRITTEN THAT NOTE AND PLACED IT UPON MY BLOTTING PAD BEFORE WE HAD GONE FORTH TOGETHER SHE WELL KNOWING THAT SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN RE CROSS MY THRESHOLD AH THE POIGNANT BITTERNESS OF IT ALL HAD GRIPPED MY HEART
3488-65654-0017 MY CUP OF UNHAPPINESS WAS NOW ASSUREDLY FULL HOW BRIEF HAD BEEN MY JOY HOW QUICKLY MY WORST FEARS HAD BEEN REALIZED ABOUT THE QUIET OLD WORLD DECAYING TOWN I WANDERED HARDLY KNOWING WHITHER I WENT
3488-65654-0018 WHEN EVERY NOW AND THEN IN THE FADING LIGHT I FOUND MYSELF GOING INTO THE COUNTRY I TURNED BACK MINDFUL OF MY PROMISE NOT TO LEAVE THE PLACE WITHOUT PERMISSION
3488-65654-0019 I WAS EAGER TO RENEW THE CHASE YET UNTIL I RECEIVED WORD FROM THE POLICE I WAS COMPELLED TO REMAIN HELPLESS OLD CROSS THE BOOTS BECAME INQUISITIVE
3488-65654-0020 BUT I EVADED HIS QUESTIONS AND ATE MY DINNER ALONE IN THE SMALL COSY COFFEE ROOM AWAITING THE REAPPEARANCE OF INSPECTOR DEANE I HAD GIVEN MY CHAUFFEUR LIBERTY TILL EIGHT O'CLOCK BUT I WAS ALL ANXIETY TO DRIVE BACK TO LONDON
3488-65654-0021 STILL IF I RETURNED WHAT COULD I DO SYLVIA AND HER COMPANIONS HAD DRIVEN AWAY WHITHER WAS A MYSTERY THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT HAD ALREADY ISSUED AN OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSONS WANTED
3488-65654-0022 FOR WHILE I HAD BEEN AT THE POLICE OFFICE THE INSPECTOR HAD BEEN CLOSELY QUESTIONING THE MAN CROSS AND MISS HAMMOND ALREADY THE POLICE DRAG NET WAS OUT AND THE COMBINED POLICE FORCES OF EUROPE WOULD IN AN HOUR OR TWO
3488-65654-0023 BE ON THE WATCH FOR SYLVIA AND HER MYSTERIOUS COMPANIONS SO FAR AS THE UNITED KINGDOM WAS CONCERNED SIXTY THOUSAND OFFICERS DETECTIVES AND CONSTABLES WOULD BE FURNISHED WITH A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION
3488-65654-0024 OF THOSE WHO HAD HELD THAT SECRET CONSULTATION THE TIGHTEST OF TIGHT CORDONS WOULD BE DRAWN EVERY PASSENGER WHO EMBARKED AT ENGLISH PORTS FOR ABROAD WOULD BE CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED BY PLAIN CLOTHES MEN
3488-65654-0025 EVERY HOTEL KEEPER NOT ONLY IN LONDON BUT IN THE REMOTE VILLAGES AND HAMLETS WOULD BE CLOSELY QUESTIONED AS TO THE IDENTITY AND RECENT MOVEMENTS OF HIS GUESTS
3488-65654-0026 FULL DESCRIPTIONS OF SYLVIA AND HER FRIENDS WOULD BE CABLED TO AMERICA AND THE AMERICAN POLICE WOULD BE ASKED TO KEEP A SHARP LOOK OUT ON PASSENGERS ARRIVING ON ALL BOATS FROM EUROPE
3488-65654-0027 IN FACE OF THAT WHAT MORE COULD I DO THE SITUATION HAD BECOME UNBEARABLE SYLVIA'S UNACCOUNTABLE ACTION HAD PLUNGED ME INTO A VERITABLE SEA OF DESPAIR THE FUTURE SEEMED BLANK AND HOPELESS
3488-65654-0028 AND WITH APOLOGIES GAVE ME LEAVE TO DEPART INQUIRY IS BEING MADE ALONG THE ROADS IN EVERY DIRECTION FROM HERE HE SAID WE HEAR THAT THE THREE MEN AND THE WOMAN CALLED AT THE BELL AT BARNBY MOOR AND HAD SOME BREAKFAST
3488-65654-0029 AFTERWARDS THEY CONTINUED NORTHWARD BARNBY MOOR I ECHOED WHY THAT'S NEAR DONCASTER YES SIR MOTORISTS PATRONIZE THE PLACE A GOOD DEAL AND IS THAT ALL THAT IS KNOWN I INQUIRED EAGERLY ALL AT PRESENT HE SAID
3488-65654-0030 THEREFORE I LEFT AND RETURNING TO THE GARAGE MOUNTED THE CAR AND WITH HEAD LAMPS ALIGHT DROVE OUT INTO THE PITCH DARKNESS IN THE DIRECTION OF GRANTHAM
3488-65654-0031 WE SPED ALONG THE BROAD OLD COACH ROAD FOR NEARLY THREE HOURS UNTIL AT LAST WE PULLED UP BEFORE AN ANCIENT WAYSIDE INN WHICH HAD BEEN MODERNIZED AND ADAPTED TO TWENTIETH CENTURY REQUIREMENTS THE MANAGER IN REPLY TO MY EAGER QUESTIONS SAID IT WAS TRUE THAT THE DONCASTER POLICE HAD BEEN THERE MAKING INQUIRIES REGARDING FOUR MOTORISTS
3488-65654-0032 THREE GENTLEMEN AND A LADY WHO HAD CALLED THERE THAT MORNING AND HAD HAD BREAKFAST IN THE COFFEE ROOM THE HEAD WAITER WHO HAD ATTENDED THEM WAS CALLED AND I QUESTIONED HIM I THINK THE MANAGER BELIEVED ME TO BE A DETECTIVE FOR HE WAS MOST COURTEOUS
3488-65654-0033 AND READY TO GIVE ME ALL INFORMATION YES SIR REPLIED THE TALL SLIM HEAD WAITER THEY CAME HERE IN A GREAT HURRY AND SEEMED TO HAVE COME A LONG DISTANCE JUDGING FROM THE WAY THE CAR WAS PLASTERED WITH MUD
3488-65654-0034 THE LADY WAS VERY COLD FOR THEY HAD AN OPEN CAR AND SHE WORE A GENTLEMAN'S OVERCOAT AND A SHAWL TIED AROUND HER HEAD THE TALLEST OF THE GENTLEMEN DROVE THE CAR THEY CALLED HIM LEWIS DID YOU HEAR THEM ADDRESS THE LADY I ASKED EAGERLY
3488-65654-0035 THEY CALLED HER SONIA SIR AND YOU SAY SHE SEEMED VERY FATIGUED VERY SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND CHANGED HER EVENING GOWN FOR A STUFF DRESS WHICH WAS BROUGHT OUT OF THE CAR
3488-65654-0036 THEN SHE CAME DOWN AND JOINED THE OTHERS AT BREAKFAST THEY GAVE YOU NO INDICATION AS TO THEIR DESTINATION I SUPPOSE WELL SIR I THINK THEY WERE RETURNING TO LONDON FOR I HEARD ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT CATCHING THE BOAT TRAIN
3488-65654-0037 THEY MAY HAVE MEANT THE HARWICH BOAT TRAIN FROM THE NORTH I REMARKED VERY LIKELY SIR ONE PORTION OF THAT TRAIN COMES THROUGH DONCASTER IN THE AFTERNOON TO PETERBOROUGH AND MARCH
3488-65654-0038 WHILE THE OTHER COMES DOWN TO RUGBY ON THE NORTH WESTERN AND THEN GOES ACROSS TO PETERBOROUGH BY WAY OF MARKET HARBOROUGH THEN THEY MAY HAVE JOINED THAT
3488-65654-0039 IF SO THE POLICE ARE CERTAIN TO SPOT THEM LAUGHED THE WAITER THEY'RE WANTED FOR THE THEFT OF A PRINCESS'S JEWELS THEY SAY WHAT SHOULD I DO IT WAS NOW LONG PAST TEN O'CLOCK AND I COULD NOT POSSIBLY ARRIVE AT PARKESTON BEFORE EARLY MORNING
3488-65654-0040 BESIDES IF THEY HAD REALLY GONE THERE THEY WOULD NO DOUBT BE ARRESTED THE MAN WITH THE PIMPLY FACE WHOSE DESCRIPTION SO CLOSELY TALLIED WITH THAT OF RECKITT
3488-65654-0041 THEREFORE I CONCLUDED THAT WHATEVER HAD BEEN SAID AT TABLE HAD BEEN SAID WITH THE DISTINCT OBJECT OF MISLEADING THE WAITER THE VERY MANNER IN WHICH THE DIAMONDS HAD BEEN STOLEN SHOWED A CUNNING AND A DARING UNSURPASSED
