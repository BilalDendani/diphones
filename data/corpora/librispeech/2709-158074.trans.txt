2709-158074-0000 IN THE SUFFRAGE STATES WHEN EVERY ONE OF THEM IS A PROFESSING SUFFRAGIST IS UTTER FOLLY SO RAN THE COMMENT OF THE POLITICAL WISE ACRES IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN FOURTEEN BUT THE WOMEN HAD FAITH IN THEIR APPEAL
2709-158074-0001 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE IN A FEW WORDS ANY ADEQUATE PICTURE OF THE ANGER OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AT OUR ENTRANCE INTO THE CAMPAIGN SIX WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION THEY WOKE UP TO FIND THE ISSUE OF NATIONAL SUFFRAGE INJECTED INTO A CAMPAIGN
2709-158074-0002 WHICH THEY HAD MEANT SHOULD BE NO MORE STIRRING THAN AN ORDERLY AND PERFUNCTORY ENDORSEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT'S LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM THE CAMPAIGN BECAME A VERY HOT ONE DURING WHICH MOST OF THE MILITANCY SEEMED TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE POLITICAL LEADERS
2709-158074-0003 HEAVY FISTS CAME DOWN ON DESKS HARSH WORDS WERE SPOKEN VIOLENT THREATS WERE MADE IN COLORADO WHERE I WAS CAM PAIGNING I WAS INVITED POLITELY BUT FIRMLY BY THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER TO LEAVE THE STATE THE MORNING AFTER I HAD ARRIVED
2709-158074-0004 YOU CAN DO NO GOOD HERE I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE AT ONCE BESIDES YOUR PLAN IS IMPRACTICABLE AND THE WOMEN WILL NOT SUPPORT IT
2709-158074-0005 YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK WOMEN TO DO THIS
2709-158074-0006 OF COURSE THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS DID NOT WELCOME AN ISSUE RAISED UNEXPECTEDLY AND ONE WHICH FORCED THEM TO SPEND AN ENDLESS AMOUNT OF TIME APOLOGIZING FOR AND EXPLAINING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S RECORD
2709-158074-0007 NOR DID THEY RELISH SPENDING MORE MONEY PUBLISHING MORE LITERATURE IN SHORT ADDING GREATLY TO THE BURDENS OF THEIR CAMPAIGN THE CANDIDATES A LITTLE MORE SUAVE THAN THE PARTY LEADERS PROVED MOST ELOQUENTLY
2709-158074-0008 ONE CANDIDATE EVEN CLAIMED A SUFFRAGE INHERITANCE FROM HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER THIS FIRST ENTRY OF WOMEN INTO A NATIONAL ELECTION ON THE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A QUICK BRILLIANT DASH
2709-158074-0009 WITH ALL ITS SKETCHINESS HOWEVER IT HAD IMMEDIATE POLITICAL RESULTS AND WHEN THE ELECTION WAS OVER THERE CAME TARDILY A GENERAL PUBLIC RECOGNITION THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL UNION HAD MADE A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO THESE RESULTS
2709-158074-0010 FOR FORTY THREE OF THESE SEATS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY RAN CANDIDATES WE OPPOSED IN OUR CAMPAIGN ALL OF THESE CANDIDATES OUT OF THE FORTY THREE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES RUNNING
2709-158074-0011 WHILE IT WAS NOT OUR PRIMARY AIM TO DEFEAT CANDIDATES IT WAS GENERALLY CONCEDED THAT WE HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THESE DEFEATS OUR AIM IN THIS CAMPAIGN WAS PRIMARILY TO CALL TO THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC THE BAD SUFFRAGE RECORD OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
2709-158074-0012 THE EFFECT OF OUR CAMPAIGN WAS SOON EVIDENT IN CONGRESS
2709-158074-0013 PROVIDING FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PERMITTING A NATIONAL INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM ON SUFFRAGE IN THE STATES THEREBY FORCING UPON WOMEN THE VERY COURSE WE HAD SOUGHT TO CIRCUMVENT
2709-158074-0014 THIS RED HERRING DRAWN ACROSS THE PATH HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE CONSERVATIVE SUFF RAGISTS EVIDENTLY IN A MOMENT OF HOPELESSNESS AND THEIR STRENGTH PUT BEHIND IT
2709-158074-0015 BUT THE POLITICIANS WHO PERSUADE THEM TO BACK IT KNEW THAT IT WAS MERELY AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE ISSUE THIS MADE NECESSARY A TREMENDOUS CAMPAIGN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY BY THE CONGRESSIONAL UNION
2709-158074-0016 WITH THE RESULT THAT THE COMPROMISE MEASURE WAS EVENTUALLY ABANDONED DURING ITS LIFE HOWEVER POLITICIANS WERE HAPPY IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIVIDE THEIR SUPPORT BETWEEN IT AND THE ORIGINAL AMENDMENT WHICH WAS STILL PENDING
2709-158074-0017 TO OFFSET THIS DANGER AND TO SHOW AGAIN IN DRAMATIC FASHION THE STRENGTH AND WILL OF THE WOMEN VOTERS TO ACT ON THIS ISSUE WE MADE POLITICAL WORK AMONG THE WESTERN WOMEN THE PRINCIPAL EFFORT OF THE YEAR NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE YEAR PRECEDING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
2709-158074-0018 WE OPENED SUFFRAGE HEADQUARTERS IN THE PALACE OF EDUCATION ON THE EXPOSITION GROUNDS FROM THERE WE CALLED THE FIRST WOMAN VOTERS CONVENTION EVER HELD IN THE WORLD FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF ATTACHING POLITICAL STRENGTH TO THE MOVEMENT
2709-158074-0019 MISSUS O H P BELMONT WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE WHICH SIGNED THE CONVENTION CALL
2709-158074-0020 THE CONVENTION WENT ON RECORD UNANIMOUSLY FOR FURTHER POLITICAL ACTION ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL SUFFRAGE AND FOR THE ORIGINAL AMENDMENT WITHOUT COMPROMISE AND PLEDGED ITSELF TO USE ALL POWER TO THIS END
2709-158074-0021 WITHOUT REGARD TO THE INTERESTS OF ANY EXISTING POLITICAL PARTY TWO EMISSARIES SARA BARD FIELD AND FRANCES JOLIFFE BOTH OF CALIFORNIA WERE COMMISSIONED BY WOMEN VOTERS AT THE FINAL SESSION
2709-158074-0022 WHEN MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE PRESENT TO GO TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS BEARING THESE RESOLUTIONS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SIGNATURES UPON A PETITION GATHERED DURING THE SUMMER THEY WOULD SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT
2709-158074-0023 LEST HE SHOULD BE INCLINED TO TAKE LIGHTLY THE WOMEN VOTERS RESOLUTIONS THE ENVOYS SYMBOLIC OF THE NEW STRENGTH THAT WAS TO COME OUT OF THE WEST MADE THEIR JOURNEY ACROSS CONTINENT BY AUTOMOBILE THEY CREATED A SENSATION ALL ALONG THE WAY
2709-158074-0024 RECEIVED AS THEY WERE BY GOVERNORS BY MAYORS BY OFFICIALS HIGH AND LOW AND BY THE POPULACE THOUSANDS MORE ADDED THEIR NAMES TO THE PETITION AND IT WAS ROLLED UP TO GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS UNTIL IN DECEMBER
2709-158074-0025 WHEN UNROLLED IT LITERALLY STRETCHED OVER MILES AS IT WAS BORNE TO THE CAPITOL WITH HONOR ESCORTS THE ACTION OF THE CONVENTION SCARCELY COLD AND THE ENVOYS MID WAY ACROSS THE CONTINENT
2709-158074-0026 THE PRESIDENT HASTENED TO NEW JERSEY TO CAST HIS VOTE FOR SUFFRAGE IN A STATE REFERENDUM
2709-158074-0027 HE REPEATED HIS POSITION PUTTING THE EMPHASIS UPON HIS OPPOSITION TO NATIONAL SUFFRAGE RATHER THAN ON HIS BELIEF IN SUFFRAGE FOR HIS STATE
2709-158074-0028 AND THAT IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD IT BE MADE A PARTY QUESTION
2709-158074-0029 HE KNEW WOMEN WERE ASKING THE POWERFUL AID OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES NOT THE AID OF MISTER WILSON OF PRINCETON NEW JERSEY THE STATE AMENDMENT IN NEW JERSEY WAS CERTAIN TO FAIL AS PRESIDENT WILSON WELL KNEW
2709-158074-0030 CASTING A VOTE FOR IT WOULD HELP HIS CASE WITH WOMEN VOTERS AND STILL NOT BRING SUFFRAGE IN THE EAST A STEP NEARER THE ENVOYS RECEPTION AT THE CAPITOL WAS INDEED DRAMATIC THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ESCORTED THEM AMID BANDS AND BANNERS TO THE HALLS OF CONGRESS
2709-158074-0031 WHERE THEY WERE RECEIVED BY SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES AND ADDRESSED WITH ELOQUENT SPEECHES THE ENVOYS REPLIED BY ASKING THAT THEIR MESSAGE BE CARRIED BY FRIENDS OF THE MEASURE TO THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE AND THIS WAS DONE
2709-158074-0032 THE ENVOYS WAITED UPON THE PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS VISIT OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF WOMEN WITH POWER MARKED RATHER AN ADVANCE IN THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION HE LISTENED WITH AN EAGER ATTENTION TO THE STORY OF THE NEW FOUND POWER AND WHAT WOMEN MEANT TO DO WITH IT
2709-158074-0033 ON THE QUESTION OF NATIONAL SUFFRAGE AND WOULD CONFER WITH HIS PARTY COLLEAGUES THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEES HEARD THE CASE OF THE ENVOYS THEY WERE GIVEN A HEARING BEFORE THE SENATE SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE AND BEFORE THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
2709-158074-0034 IN ONE OF THE MOST LIVELY AND ENTERTAINING INQUISITIONS IN WHICH WOMEN EVER PARTICIPATED NO MORE QUESTIONS ON MOTHER AND HOME NO SWAN SONG ON THE PASSING OF CHARM AND WOMANLY LOVELINESS
2709-158074-0035 ONLY AGILE SCRAMBLING BY EACH COMMITTEE MEMBER TO ASK WITH EAGERNESS AND SOME HEAT
2709-158074-0036 WELL IF THIS AMENDMENT HAS NOT PASSED CONGRESS BY THEN
2709-158074-0037 IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE WOMEN WERE ALLOWED TO TELL THEIR STORY SO EAGER WAS THE COMMITTEE TO JUMP AHEAD TO POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES
2709-158074-0038 SIRS THAT DEPENDS UPON WHAT YOU GENTLEMEN DO
2709-158074-0039 BUT THEY NEVER GOT ANY FURTHER FROM THE MAIN BASE OF THEIR INTEREST
2709-158074-0040 AND SO THE HEARING PASSED IN SOMETHING OF A VERBAL RIOT BUT WITH NO DOUBT AS TO THE FACT THAT CONGRESSMEN WERE ALARMED BY THE PROSPECT OF WOMEN VOTING AS A PROTEST GROUP THE NEW YEAR FOUND THE SENATE PROMPTLY REPORTING THE MEASURE FAVORABLY AGAIN
2709-158074-0041 BUT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOOTBALLED IT TO ITS SUB COMMITTEE BACK TO THE WHOLE COMMITTEE POSTPONED IT MARKED TIME DODGED DEFEATED IT THE PROBLEM OF NEUTRALITY TOWARD THE EUROPEAN WAR WAS AGITATING THE MINDS OF POLITICAL LEADERS
2709-158074-0042 NOTHING LIKE SUFFRAGE FOR WOMEN MUST BE ALLOWED TO ROCK THE SHIP EVEN SLIGHTLY OH NO INDEED IT WAS MEN'S BUSINESS TO KEEP THE NATION OUT OF WAR MEN NEVER HAD SHOWN MARKED SKILL AT KEEPING NATIONS OUT OF WAR IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD BUT NEVER MIND
2709-158074-0043 LOGIC MUST NOT BE PRESSED TOO HARD UPON THE REASONING SEX THIS TIME MEN WOULD DO IT THE EXCITING NATIONAL ELECTION CONTEST WAS APPROACHING
2709-158074-0044 PARTY CONVENTIONS WERE SCHEDULED TO MEET IN JUNE WHILE THE AMENDMENT LANGUISHED AT THE CAPITOL IT WAS CLEAR THAT MORE HIGHLY ORGANIZED WOMAN POWER WOULD HAVE TO BE CALLED INTO ACTION BEFORE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WOULD SPEED ITS PACE
2709-158074-0045 THE INSTANT RESPONSE WHICH MET THIS APPEAL SURPASSED THE MOST OPTIMISTIC HOPES THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ASSEMBLED IN CHICAGO FOR THIS CONVENTION WHICH BECAME EPOCH MAKING NOT ONLY IN THE SUFFRAGE FIGHT BUT IN THE WHOLE WOMAN MOVEMENT
2709-158074-0046 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WOMEN CAME TOGETHER TO ORGANIZE THEIR POLITICAL POWER INTO A PARTY TO FREE THEIR OWN SEX FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY REPRESENTATIVES OF MEN'S POLITICAL PARTIES CAME TO PLEAD BEFORE THESE WOMEN VOTERS
2709-158074-0047 FOR THE SUPPORT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTIES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SENT AS ITS REPRESENTATIVES JOHN HAYS HAMMOND AND C S OSBORN FORMERLY GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN THE DEMOCRATS SENT THEIR MOST PERSUASIVE ORATOR
2709-158074-0048 PRESIDENT WILSON'S FRIEND DUDLEY FIELD MALONE COLLECTOR OF THE PORT OF NEW YORK ALLAN BENSON CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY ON THE SOCIALIST TICKET REPRESENTED THE SOCIALIST PARTY EDWARD POLLING PROHIBITION LEADER SPOKE FOR THE PROHIBITION PARTY
2709-158074-0049 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MADE ITS SUFFRAGE PLANK SPECIFIC AGAINST ACTION BY CONGRESS
2709-158074-0050 WE RECOMMEND THE EXTENSION OF THE FRANCHISE TO THE WOMEN OF THE COUNTRY BY THE STATES UPON THE SAME TERMS AS MEN
2709-158074-0051 IT WAS OPENLY STATED AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION BY LEADING ADMINISTRATION DEMOCRATS THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAD WRITTEN THIS SUFFRAGE PLANK IF THE REPUBLICANS COULD AFFORD TO WRITE A VAGUE AND INDEFINITE PLANK THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY COULD NOT
2709-158074-0052 THEY AS THE PARTY IN POWER HAD BEEN UNDER FIRE AND WERE FORCED TO TAKE SIDES THEY DID SO THE PRESIDENT CHOSE THE PLANK AND HIS SUBORDINATES FOLLOWED HIS LEAD
2709-158074-0053 IT MAY BE REMARKED IN PASSING THAT THIS DECLARATION SO SOLIDIFIED THE OPPOSITION WITHIN THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT ULTIMATELY SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE IT HE MET STUBBORN RESISTANCE PROTECTED BY THE PRESIDENT'S PLANK
2709-158074-0054 THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS CONTINUED TO BLOCK NATIONAL SUFFRAGE IT WOULD NOT PERMIT IT EVEN TO BE REPORTED FROM THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THE PARTY PLATFORM WAS WRITTEN
2709-158074-0055 TO MISSUS D E HOOKER OF RICHMOND VIRGINIA WHO AS A DELEGATE FROM THE VIRGINIA FEDERATION OF LABOR REPRESENTING SIXTY THOUSAND MEMBERS WENT TO HIM SOON AFTER TO ASK HIS SUPPORT OF THE AMENDMENT THE PRESIDENT SAID
2709-158074-0056 I AM OPPOSED BY CONVICTION AND POLITICAL TRADITIONS TO FEDERAL ACTION ON THIS QUESTION MOREOVER AFTER THE PLANK WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM AT SAINT LOUIS
2709-158074-0057 PRESIDENT WILSON COULD NOT ACT BECAUSE THE PARTY PLANK WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN PREVENTED HIM FROM DOING SO MEANWHILE THE WOMEN CONTINUED TO PROTEST MISS MABEL VERNON OF DELAWARE BELOVED AND GIFTED CRUSADER
2709-158074-0058 WAS THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE WOMAN'S PARTY TO COMMIT A MILITANT ACT PRESIDENT WILSON SPEAKING AT THE DEDICATION SERVICES OF THE LABOR TEMPLE IN WASHINGTON WAS DECLARING HIS INTEREST IN ALL CLASSES AND ALL STRUGGLES
2709-158074-0059 HE WAS PROCLAIMING HIS BELIEFS IN THE ABSTRACTIONS OF LIBERTY AND JUSTICE WHEN MISS VERNON WHO WAS SEATED ON THE PLATFORM FROM WHICH HE WAS SPEAKING SAID IN HER POWERFUL VOICE
2709-158074-0060 MISTER PRESIDENT IF YOU SINCERELY DESIRE TO FORWARD THE INTERESTS OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHY DO YOU OPPOSE THE NATIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT OF WOMEN
2709-158074-0061 INSTANT CONSTERNATION AROSE BUT THE IDEA HAD PENETRATED TO THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE HUGE ASSEMBLY THAT WOMEN WERE PROTESTING TO THE PRESIDENT AGAINST THE DENIAL OF THEIR LIBERTY
2709-158074-0062 MISS VERNON REPEATED HER QUESTION LATER AND WAS ORDERED FROM THE MEETING BY THE POLICE AS THE SUMMER WORE ON WOMEN REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO ENTER THE NATIONAL CONTEST IN THE AUTUMN ATTENTION WAS FOCUSSED ON THE TWO RIVAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
2709-158074-0063 WOODROW WILSON AND CHARLES EVANS HUGHES THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE UPON WHOM THE NEW WOMAN'S PARTY WORKED
2709-158074-0064 THE NEXT POLITICAL RESULT OF THE NEW SOLIDARITY OF WOMEN WAS MISTER HUGHES DECLARATION ON AUGUST FIRST NINETEEN SIXTEEN
2709-158074-0065 THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS ADJOURNED WITHOUT EVEN REPORT ING THE MEASURE TO THAT BODY FOR A VOTE AND WENT FORTHWITH TO THE COUNTRY TO ASK REELECTION WE ALSO WENT TO THE COUNTRY
2709-158074-0066 WE WENT TO THE WOMEN VOTERS TO LAY BEFORE THEM AGAIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S RECORD NOW COMPLETE THROUGH ONE ADMINISTRATION WE ASKED WOMEN VOTERS AGAIN TO WITHHOLD THEIR SUPPORT NATIONALLY FROM PRESIDENT WILSON AND HIS PARTY
2709-158074-0067 THE PRESIDENT ACCEPTED AT ONCE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE A CONVENTION OF SUFFRAGISTS AT ATLANTIC CITY IN AN EFFORT TO PROVE HIS GREAT BELIEF IN SUFFRAGE
2709-158074-0068 THE TIDE IS RISING TO MEET THE MOON YOU CAN AFFORD TO WAIT
2709-158074-0069 WHATEVER WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT OF HIS FIGURE OF SPEECH WE DISAGREED WITH HIS CONCLUSION THE CAMPAIGN ON DEMOCRATIC SPEAKERS THROUGHOUT THE WEST FOUND AN UNEXPECTED ORGANIZED FORCE AMONG WOMEN DEMANDING AN EXPLANATION OF THE PAST CONDUCT
2709-158074-0070 OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND INSISTING ON AN IMMEDIATE DECLARATION BY THE PRESIDENT IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT DEMOCRATIC ORATORS DID THEIR UTMOST TO MEET THIS OPPOSITION
2709-158074-0071 ENTICING DOCTRINE TO WOMEN THE PEACE LOVERS OF THE HUMAN RACE
2709-158074-0072 WITH A BUDGET FIVE TIMES AS LARGE AND WITH PILED UP EVIDENCE OF DEMOCRATIC HOSTILITY
2709-158074-0073 THE PEOPLE WERE EXCITED TO AN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED PITCH OVER THE ISSUE OF PEACE VERSUS WAR IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF COMPETING WITH THIS EMOTIONAL ISSUE WHICH MEANT THE IMMEDIATE DISPOSAL OF MILLIONS OF LIVES
2709-158074-0074 IT WAS SOON EVIDENT THAT THE TWO ISSUES WERE RUNNING ALMOST NECK AND NECK IN THE WESTERN TERRITORY NO LESS SKILLED A CAMPAIGNER THAN WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN TOOK THE STUMP IN THE WEST AGAINST THE WOMAN'S PARTY
2709-158074-0075 AT LEAST A THIRD OF EACH SPEECH WAS DEVOTED TO SUFFRAGE HE URGED HE EXHORTED HE APOLOGIZED HE EXPLAINED HE PLEADED HE CONDEMNED OFTEN HE WAS HECKLED
2709-158074-0076 YOU CANNOT PICK CHERRIES BEFORE THEY ARE RIPE
2709-158074-0077 BY THE TIME HE GOT TO CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THE CHERRIES HAD RIPENED CONSIDERABLY FOR MISTER BRYAN CAME OUT PUBLICLY FOR THE NATIONAL AMENDMENT WHAT WAS TRUE OF MISTER BRYAN WAS TRUE OF PRACTICALLY EVERY DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNER
2709-158074-0078 AGAINST THEIR WILLS THEY WERE FORCED TO TALK ABOUT SUFFRAGE
2709-158074-0079 SOME MERELY APOLOGIZED AND EXPLAINED
2709-158074-0080 IF ONLY YOU WOMEN WILL STAND BY WILSON AND RETURN HIM TO POWER
2709-158074-0081 SPACE WILL NOT PERMIT IN THIS BOOK TO GIVE MORE THAN A HINT OF THE SCOPE AND STRENGTH OF OUR CAMPAIGN
2709-158074-0082 YOU WOULD AGREE THAT IT WAS NOT PEACE ALONE THAT WAS THE DOMINANT ISSUE BUT PEACE AND SUFFRAGE IT MUST BE MADE PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THE WOMAN'S PARTY DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ELECT MISTER HUGHES IT DID NOT FEEL STRONG ENOUGH TO BACK A CANDIDATE IN ITS FIRST BATTLE
2709-158074-0083 AND DID NOT CONDUCT ITS FIGHT AFFIRMATIVELY AT ALL NO SPEECHES WERE MADE FOR MISTER HUGHES AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE APPEAL WAS TO VOTE A VOTE OF PROTEST AGAINST MISTER WILSON AND HIS CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES BECAUSE HE AND HIS PARTY
2709-158074-0084 HAD HAD THE POWER TO PASS THE AMENDMENT THROUGH CONGRESS AND HAD REFUSED TO DO SO THAT LEFT THE WOMEN FREE TO CHOOSE FROM AMONG THE REPUBLICANS SOCIALISTS AND PROHIBITIONISTS IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED THAT THE MAIN STRENGTH OF THE VOTE TAKEN FROM MISTER WILSON
2709-158074-0085 WOULD GO TO MISTER HUGHES AS FEW WOMEN PERHAPS THREW THEIR VOTES TO THE MINORITY PARTIES BUT JUST AS THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY'S PROTEST HAD BEEN EFFECTIVE IN SECURING PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION WITHOUT WINNING THE ELECTION
2709-158074-0086 SO THE WOMAN'S PARTY HOPED ITS PROTEST WOULD BRING RESULTS IN CONGRESS WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO WIN THE ELECTION HISTORY WILL NEVER KNOW IN ROUND NUMBERS HOW MANY WOMEN VOTED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY AT THIS CRISIS FOR THERE ARE NO RECORDS KEPT FOR MEN AND WOMEN SEPARATELY
2709-158074-0087 EXCEPT IN ONE STATE IN ILLINOIS THE WOMEN THERE VOTED TWO TO ONE AGAINST MISTER WILSON AND FOR MISTER HUGHES MEN OUTNUMBER WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WESTERN TERRITORY IN SOME STATES TWO AND THREE TO ONE IN NEVADA STILL HIGHER
2709-158074-0088 IN THE NINETEEN SIXTEEN ELECTION WHEN THE WHOLE WEST WAS AFLAME FOR HIM BECAUSE OF HIS PEACE POLICY
2709-158074-0089 ENTHUSIASM FOR MISTER HUGHES IN THE WEST WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY MARKED TO ACCOUNT ENTIRELY FOR THE LOSS OF THESE TWELVE ELECTORAL VOTES OUR CLAIM THAT DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION TO SUFFRAGE HAD COST MANY OF THEM
2709-158074-0090 HAD ONLY ONE DEMOCRATIC MEMBER FROM A SUFFRAGE STATE MISTER TAGGART OF KANSAS STANDING FOR REELECTION THIS WAS THE ONLY SPOT WHERE WOMEN COULD STRIKE OUT AGAINST THE ACTION OF THIS COMMITTEE AND MISTER TAGGART THEY STRUCK WITH SUCCESS
2709-158074-0091 HE WAS DEFEATED ALMOST WHOLLY BY THE WOMEN'S VOTES WITH A MODEST CAMPAIGN FUND OF SLIGHTLY OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RAISED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN SMALL SUMS THE WOMEN HAD FORCED THE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO ASSUME THE DEFENSIVE
2709-158074-0092 AND TO PRACTICALLY DOUBLE EXPENDITURE AND WORK ON THIS ISSUE AS MUCH LITERATURE WAS USED ON SUFFRAGE AS ON PEACE IN THE SUFFRAGE STATES
