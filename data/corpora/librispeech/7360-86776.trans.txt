7360-86776-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTY THE BALL IT WAS IN THE WARMEST DAYS OF JULY WHEN IN DUE COURSE OF TIME THE SATURDAY ARRIVED UPON WHICH THE BALL WAS TO TAKE PLACE
7360-86776-0001 THE BRANCHES OF THE GREAT TREES IN THE GARDEN OF THE COUNT'S HOUSE STOOD OUT BOLDLY AGAINST THE AZURE CANOPY OF HEAVEN WHICH WAS STUDDED WITH GOLDEN STARS BUT WHERE THE LAST FLEETING CLOUDS OF A VANISHING STORM YET LINGERED FROM THE APARTMENTS ON THE GROUND FLOOR MIGHT BE HEARD THE SOUND OF MUSIC
7360-86776-0002 WITH THE WHIRL OF THE WALTZ AND GALOP WHILE BRILLIANT STREAMS OF LIGHT SHONE THROUGH THE OPENINGS OF THE VENETIAN BLINDS AT THIS MOMENT THE GARDEN WAS ONLY OCCUPIED BY ABOUT TEN SERVANTS WHO HAD JUST RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THEIR MISTRESS TO PREPARE THE SUPPER
7360-86776-0003 THE SERENITY OF THE WEATHER CONTINUING TO INCREASE UNTIL NOW IT HAD BEEN UNDECIDED WHETHER THE SUPPER SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE DINING ROOM OR UNDER A LONG TENT ERECTED ON THE LAWN BUT THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE SKY STUDDED WITH STARS HAD SETTLED THE QUESTION IN FAVOR OF THE LAWN
7360-86776-0004 THE GARDENS WERE ILLUMINATED WITH COLORED LANTERNS ACCORDING TO THE ITALIAN CUSTOM AND AS IS USUAL IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE LUXURIES OF THE TABLE THE RAREST OF ALL LUXURIES IN THEIR COMPLETE FORM ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD
7360-86776-0005 THE SUPPER TABLE WAS LOADED WITH WAX LIGHTS AND FLOWERS AT THE TIME THE COUNTESS OF MORCERF RETURNED TO THE ROOMS AFTER GIVING HER ORDERS MANY GUESTS WERE ARRIVING MORE ATTRACTED BY THE CHARMING HOSPITALITY OF THE COUNTESS THAN BY THE DISTINGUISHED POSITION OF THE COUNT
7360-86776-0006 FOR OWING TO THE GOOD TASTE OF MERCEDES ONE WAS SURE OF FINDING SOME DEVICES AT HER ENTERTAINMENT WORTHY OF DESCRIBING OR EVEN COPYING IN CASE OF NEED
7360-86776-0007 THE LATTER MADE A SIGN AND WHEN THE CARRIAGES HAD DRAWN CLOSE TOGETHER SAID

7360-86776-0017 WHO IS TRYING TO ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION ALBERT BOWED TO MADAME DANGLARS AND ADVANCED TOWARDS MADAME DE VILLEFORT WHOSE LIPS OPENED AS HE APPROACHED
7360-86776-0018 WELL WHAT IS IT IF I GUESS RIGHTLY WILL YOU CONFESS IT YES ON YOUR HONOR ON MY HONOR YOU WERE GOING TO ASK ME IF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO HAD ARRIVED OR WAS EXPECTED
7360-86776-0019 YES YESTERDAY WHAT DID HE TELL YOU THAT HE WAS LEAVING AT THE SAME TIME AS HIS LETTER
7360-86776-0020 THE COUNT WILL COME OF THAT YOU MAY BE SATISFIED YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS ANOTHER NAME BESIDES MONTE CRISTO NO I DID NOT KNOW IT MONTE CRISTO IS THE NAME OF AN ISLAND AND HE HAS A FAMILY NAME I NEVER HEARD IT WELL THEN I AM BETTER INFORMED THAN YOU
7360-86776-0021 HIS NAME IS ZACCONE IT IS POSSIBLE HE IS A MALTESE THAT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THE SON OF A SHIPOWNER REALLY YOU SHOULD RELATE ALL THIS ALOUD YOU WOULD HAVE THE GREATEST SUCCESS
7360-86776-0022 HE SERVED IN INDIA DISCOVERED A MINE IN THESSALY AND COMES TO PARIS TO ESTABLISH A MINERAL WATER CURE
7360-86776-0023 WELL I'M SURE SAID MORCERF THIS IS INDEED NEWS AM I ALLOWED TO REPEAT IT YES BUT CAUTIOUSLY
7360-86776-0024 WHY SO BECAUSE IT IS A SECRET JUST DISCOVERED BY WHOM THE POLICE THEN THE NEWS ORIGINATED AT THE PREFECT'S LAST NIGHT PARIS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IS ASTONISHED AT THE SIGHT OF SUCH UNUSUAL SPLENDOR
7360-86776-0025 WELL WELL NOTHING MORE IS WANTING THAN TO ARREST THE COUNT AS A VAGABOND ON THE PRETEXT OF HIS BEING TOO RICH INDEED THAT DOUBTLESS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HIS CREDENTIALS HAD NOT BEEN SO FAVORABLE POOR COUNT AND IS HE AWARE OF THE DANGER HE HAS BEEN IN
7360-86776-0026 I THINK NOT THEN IT WILL BE BUT CHARITABLE TO INFORM HIM WHEN HE ARRIVES I WILL NOT FAIL TO DO SO JUST THEN A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WITH BRIGHT EYES BLACK HAIR AND GLOSSY MUSTACHE RESPECTFULLY BOWED TO MADAME DE VILLEFORT
7360-86776-0027 ALBERT EXTENDED HIS HAND MADAME SAID ALBERT
7360-86776-0028 ONE OF OUR BEST AND ABOVE ALL OF OUR BRAVEST OFFICERS
7360-86776-0029 THIS ANSWER AND ESPECIALLY THE TONE IN WHICH IT WAS UTTERED CHILLED THE HEART OF POOR MORREL BUT A RECOMPENSE WAS IN STORE FOR HIM TURNING AROUND HE SAW NEAR THE DOOR A BEAUTIFUL FAIR FACE WHOSE LARGE BLUE EYES WERE WITHOUT ANY MARKED EXPRESSION
7360-86776-0030 FIXED UPON HIM WHILE THE BOUQUET OF MYOSOTIS WAS GENTLY RAISED TO HER LIPS THE SALUTATION WAS SO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT MORREL WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES PLACED HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS MOUTH
7360-86776-0031 AND THESE TWO LIVING STATUES WHOSE HEARTS BEAT SO VIOLENTLY UNDER THEIR MARBLE ASPECT SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE ROOM FORGOT THEMSELVES FOR A MOMENT OR RATHER FORGOT THE WORLD IN THEIR MUTUAL CONTEMPLATION
7360-86776-0032 THEY MIGHT HAVE REMAINED MUCH LONGER LOST IN ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT ANY ONE NOTICING THEIR ABSTRACTION THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO HAD JUST ENTERED
7360-86776-0033 IT WAS NOT THE COAT UNEXCEPTIONAL IN ITS CUT THOUGH SIMPLE AND UNORNAMENTED IT WAS NOT THE PLAIN WHITE WAISTCOAT IT WAS NOT THE TROUSERS THAT DISPLAYED THE FOOT SO PERFECTLY FORMED IT WAS NONE OF THESE THINGS THAT ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION
7360-86776-0034 IT WAS HIS PALE COMPLEXION HIS WAVING BLACK HAIR HIS CALM AND SERENE EXPRESSION HIS DARK AND MELANCHOLY EYE HIS MOUTH CHISELLED WITH SUCH MARVELLOUS DELICACY WHICH SO EASILY EXPRESSED SUCH HIGH DISDAIN
7360-86776-0035 THESE WERE WHAT FIXED THE ATTENTION OF ALL UPON HIM MANY MEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN HANDSOMER BUT CERTAINLY THERE COULD BE NONE WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS MORE SIGNIFICANT
7360-86776-0036 EVERYTHING ABOUT THE COUNT SEEMED TO HAVE ITS MEANING FOR THE CONSTANT HABIT OF THOUGHT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED HAD GIVEN AN EASE AND VIGOR TO THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AND EVEN TO THE MOST TRIFLING GESTURE SCARCELY TO BE UNDERSTOOD
7360-86776-0037 YET THE PARISIAN WORLD IS SO STRANGE THAT EVEN ALL THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE WON ATTENTION HAD THERE NOT BEEN CONNECTED WITH IT A MYSTERIOUS STORY GILDED BY AN IMMENSE FORTUNE MEANWHILE HE ADVANCED THROUGH THE ASSEMBLAGE OF GUESTS UNDER A BATTERY OF CURIOUS GLANCES TOWARDS MADAME DE MORCERF
7360-86776-0038 WHO STANDING BEFORE A MANTLE PIECE ORNAMENTED WITH FLOWERS
7360-86776-0039 NO DOUBT SHE FANCIED THE COUNT WOULD SPEAK TO HER WHILE ON HIS SIDE THE COUNT THOUGHT SHE WAS ABOUT TO ADDRESS HIM BUT BOTH REMAINED SILENT AND AFTER A MERE BOW MONTE CRISTO DIRECTED HIS STEPS TO ALBERT WHO RECEIVED HIM CORDIALLY HAVE YOU SEEN MY MOTHER ASKED ALBERT
7360-86776-0040 I HAVE JUST HAD THE PLEASURE REPLIED THE COUNT BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN YOUR FATHER SEE HE IS DOWN THERE TALKING POLITICS WITH THAT LITTLE GROUP OF GREAT GENIUSES INDEED SAID MONTE CRISTO AND SO THOSE GENTLEMEN DOWN THERE ARE MEN OF GREAT TALENT
7360-86776-0041 I SHOULD NOT HAVE GUESSED IT AND FOR WHAT KIND OF TALENT ARE THEY CELEBRATED YOU KNOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT SORTS THAT TALL HARSH LOOKING MAN IS VERY LEARNED HE DISCOVERED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME A KIND OF LIZARD WITH A VERTEBRA MORE THAN LIZARDS USUALLY HAVE
7360-86776-0042 AND HE IMMEDIATELY LAID HIS DISCOVERY BEFORE THE INSTITUTE THE THING WAS DISCUSSED FOR A LONG TIME BUT FINALLY DECIDED IN HIS FAVOR I CAN ASSURE YOU THE VERTEBRA MADE A GREAT NOISE IN THE LEARNED WORLD AND THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ONLY A KNIGHT OF THE LEGION OF HONOR WAS MADE AN OFFICER
7360-86776-0043 COME SAID MONTE CRISTO THIS CROSS SEEMS TO ME TO BE WISELY AWARDED I SUPPOSE HAD HE FOUND ANOTHER ADDITIONAL VERTEBRA THEY WOULD HAVE MADE HIM A COMMANDER VERY LIKELY SAID ALBERT
7360-86776-0044 I BELIEVE HE THRUSTS PINS THROUGH THE HEADS OF RABBITS HE MAKES FOWLS EAT MADDER AND PUNCHES THE SPINAL MARROW OUT OF DOGS WITH WHALEBONE AND HE IS MADE A MEMBER OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOR THIS NO OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY
7360-86776-0045 BUT WHAT HAS THE FRENCH ACADEMY TO DO WITH ALL THIS I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU IT SEEMS THAT HIS EXPERIMENTS HAVE VERY CONSIDERABLY ADVANCED THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE DOUBTLESS NO THAT HIS STYLE OF WRITING IS VERY GOOD
7360-86776-0046 TO THE FOWLS WHOSE BONES HE HAS DYED RED
7360-86776-0047 ALBERT LAUGHED AND THE OTHER ONE DEMANDED THE COUNT THAT ONE YES THE THIRD THE ONE IN THE DARK BLUE COAT YES HE IS A COLLEAGUE OF THE COUNT AND ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE OPPONENTS TO THE IDEA OF PROVIDING THE CHAMBER OF PEERS WITH A UNIFORM
7360-86776-0048 HE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL UPON THAT QUESTION HE STOOD BADLY WITH THE LIBERAL PAPERS BUT HIS NOBLE OPPOSITION TO THE WISHES OF THE COURT IS NOW GETTING HIM INTO FAVOR WITH THE JOURNALISTS THEY TALK OF MAKING HIM AN AMBASSADOR AND WHAT ARE HIS CLAIMS TO THE PEERAGE
7360-86776-0049 HE HAS COMPOSED TWO OR THREE COMIC OPERAS WRITTEN FOUR OR FIVE ARTICLES IN THE SIECLE AND VOTED FIVE OR SIX YEARS ON THE MINISTERIAL SIDE BRAVO VISCOUNT SAID MONTE CRISTO SMILING

7360-86776-0056 AFTER WHICH HE SMILED AND TURNED TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN IN QUESTION ALBERT HAD LEFT THE COUNT TO SPEAK TO HIS MOTHER DANGLARS TO CONVERSE WITH YOUNG CAVALCANTI MONTE CRISTO WAS FOR AN INSTANT ALONE MEANWHILE THE HEAT BECAME EXCESSIVE
7360-86776-0057 THE FOOTMEN WERE HASTENING THROUGH THE ROOMS WITH WAITERS LOADED WITH ICES MONTE CRISTO WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD BUT DREW BACK WHEN THE WAITER WAS PRESENTED TO HIM HE TOOK NO REFRESHMENT MADAME DE MORCERF DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF MONTE CRISTO
7360-86776-0058 SHE SAW THAT HE TOOK NOTHING AND EVEN NOTICED HIS GESTURE OF REFUSAL ALBERT SHE ASKED DID YOU NOTICE THAT WHAT MOTHER THAT THE COUNT HAS NEVER BEEN WILLING TO PARTAKE OF FOOD

7360-86776-0064 AND ASKED WHY THE VENETIAN BLINDS WERE NOT OPENED AS WELL AS THE WINDOWS IN A WORD SAID MERCEDES IT WAS A WAY OF ASSURING ME THAT HIS ABSTINENCE WAS INTENDED AND SHE LEFT THE ROOM
7360-86776-0065 A MINUTE AFTERWARDS THE BLINDS WERE THROWN OPEN AND THROUGH THE JESSAMINE AND CLEMATIS THAT OVERHUNG THE WINDOW ONE COULD SEE THE GARDEN ORNAMENTED WITH LANTERNS AND THE SUPPER LAID UNDER THE TENT DANCERS PLAYERS TALKERS ALL UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION OF JOY
