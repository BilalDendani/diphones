3656-168618-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN THE BATTLE FIELD AT NIGHT LET US RETURN IT IS A NECESSITY IN THIS BOOK TO THAT FATAL BATTLE FIELD ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE THE MOON WAS FULL ITS LIGHT FAVORED BLUCHER'S FEROCIOUS PURSUIT
3656-168618-0001 BETRAYED THE TRACES OF THE FUGITIVES DELIVERED UP THAT DISASTROUS MASS TO THE EAGER PRUSSIAN CAVALRY AND AIDED THE MASSACRE SUCH TRAGIC FAVORS OF THE NIGHT DO OCCUR SOMETIMES DURING CATASTROPHES AFTER THE LAST CANNON SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED
3656-168618-0002 THE PLAIN OF MONT SAINT JEAN REMAINED DESERTED THE ENGLISH OCCUPIED THE ENCAMPMENT OF THE FRENCH IT IS THE USUAL SIGN OF VICTORY TO SLEEP IN THE BED OF THE VANQUISHED THEY ESTABLISHED THEIR BIVOUAC BEYOND ROSSOMME
3656-168618-0003 THE PRUSSIANS LET LOOSE ON THE RETREATING ROUT PUSHED FORWARD WELLINGTON WENT TO THE VILLAGE OF WATERLOO TO DRAW UP HIS REPORT TO LORD BATHURST IF EVER THE SIC VOS NON VOBIS WAS APPLICABLE IT CERTAINLY IS TO THAT VILLAGE OF WATERLOO
3656-168618-0004 WATERLOO TOOK NO PART AND LAY HALF A LEAGUE FROM THE SCENE OF ACTION MONT SAINT JEAN WAS CANNONADED
3656-168618-0005 PAPELOTTE WAS BURNED PLANCENOIT WAS BURNED LA BELLE ALLIANCE BEHELD THE EMBRACE OF THE TWO CONQUERORS THESE NAMES ARE HARDLY KNOWN AND WATERLOO WHICH WORKED NOT IN THE BATTLE BEARS OFF ALL THE HONOR
3656-168618-0006 WE ARE NOT OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO FLATTER WAR WHEN THE OCCASION PRESENTS ITSELF WE TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT WAR HAS FRIGHTFUL BEAUTIES WHICH WE HAVE NOT CONCEALED IT HAS ALSO WE ACKNOWLEDGE SOME HIDEOUS FEATURES
3656-168618-0007 ONE OF THE MOST SURPRISING IS THE PROMPT STRIPPING OF THE BODIES OF THE DEAD AFTER THE VICTORY THE DAWN WHICH FOLLOWS A BATTLE ALWAYS RISES ON NAKED CORPSES WHO DOES THIS WHO THUS SOILS THE TRIUMPH
3656-168618-0008 WHAT PICKPOCKETS ARE THEY WHO PLY THEIR TRADE IN THE REAR OF GLORY SOME PHILOSOPHERS VOLTAIRE AMONG THE NUMBER AFFIRM THAT IT IS PRECISELY THOSE PERSONS HAVE MADE THE GLORY IT IS THE SAME MEN THEY SAY THERE IS NO RELIEF CORPS
3656-168618-0009 THE HERO OF THE DAY IS THE VAMPIRE OF THE NIGHT ONE HAS ASSUREDLY THE RIGHT AFTER ALL TO STRIP A CORPSE A BIT WHEN ONE IS THE AUTHOR OF THAT CORPSE FOR OUR OWN PART WE DO NOT THINK SO
3656-168618-0010 IT SEEMS TO US IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE SAME HAND SHOULD PLUCK LAURELS AND PURLOIN THE SHOES FROM A DEAD MAN ONE THING IS CERTAIN WHICH IS THAT GENERALLY AFTER CONQUERORS FOLLOW THIEVES
3656-168618-0011 BUT LET US LEAVE THE SOLDIER ESPECIALLY THE CONTEMPORARY SOLDIER OUT OF THE QUESTION EVERY ARMY HAS A REAR GUARD AND IT IS THAT WHICH MUST BE BLAMED BAT LIKE CREATURES HALF BRIGANDS AND LACKEYS
3656-168618-0012 WEARERS OF UNIFORMS WHO TAKE NO PART IN THE FIGHTING PRETENDED INVALIDS FORMIDABLE LIMPERS INTERLOPING SUTLERS TROTTING ALONG IN LITTLE CARTS SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR WIVES AND STEALING THINGS WHICH THEY SELL AGAIN
3656-168618-0013 BEGGARS OFFERING THEMSELVES AS GUIDES TO OFFICERS SOLDIERS SERVANTS MARAUDERS ARMIES ON THE MARCH IN DAYS GONE BY WE ARE NOT SPEAKING OF THE PRESENT DRAGGED ALL THIS BEHIND THEM SO THAT IN THE SPECIAL LANGUAGE THEY ARE CALLED STRAGGLERS
3656-168618-0014 NO ARMY NO NATION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE BEINGS THEY SPOKE ITALIAN AND FOLLOWED THE GERMANS THEN SPOKE FRENCH AND FOLLOWED THE ENGLISH IT WAS BY ONE OF THESE WRETCHES A SPANISH STRAGGLER WHO SPOKE FRENCH
3656-168618-0015 THAT THE MARQUIS OF FERVACQUES DECEIVED BY HIS PICARD JARGON AND TAKING HIM FOR ONE OF OUR OWN MEN WAS TRAITOROUSLY SLAIN AND ROBBED ON THE BATTLE FIELD ITSELF
3656-168618-0016 THE RASCAL SPRANG FROM THIS MARAUDING THE DETESTABLE MAXIM LIVE ON THE ENEMY PRODUCED THIS LEPROSY WHICH A STRICT DISCIPLINE ALONE COULD HEAL THERE ARE REPUTATIONS WHICH ARE DECEPTIVE
3656-168618-0017 ONE DOES NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHY CERTAIN GENERALS GREAT IN OTHER DIRECTIONS HAVE BEEN SO POPULAR
3656-168618-0018 EVIL PERMITTED CONSTITUTES PART OF GOODNESS
3656-168618-0019 THE MARAUDERS IN THE TRAIN OF AN ARMY WERE MORE OR LESS IN NUMBER ACCORDING AS THE CHIEF WAS MORE OR LESS SEVERE HOCHE AND MARCEAU HAD NO STRAGGLERS WELLINGTON HAD FEW AND WE DO HIM THE JUSTICE TO MENTION IT
3656-168618-0020 WELLINGTON WAS RIGID HE GAVE ORDERS THAT ANY ONE CAUGHT IN THE ACT SHOULD BE SHOT BUT RAPINE IS TENACIOUS THE MARAUDERS STOLE IN ONE CORNER OF THE BATTLEFIELD WHILE OTHERS WERE BEING SHOT IN ANOTHER THE MOON WAS SINISTER OVER THIS PLAIN
3656-168618-0021 TOWARDS MIDNIGHT A MAN WAS PROWLING ABOUT
3656-168618-0022 TO ALL APPEARANCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHOM WE HAVE JUST DESCRIBED NEITHER ENGLISH NOR FRENCH NEITHER PEASANT NOR SOLDIER LESS A MAN THAN A GHOUL ATTRACTED BY THE SCENT OF THE DEAD BODIES HAVING THEFT FOR HIS VICTORY AND COME TO RIFLE WATERLOO
3656-168618-0023 HE WAS CLAD IN A BLOUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING LIKE A GREAT COAT HE WAS UNEASY AND AUDACIOUS HE WALKED FORWARDS AND GAZED BEHIND HIM WHO WAS THIS MAN THE NIGHT PROBABLY KNEW MORE OF HIM THAN THE DAY
3656-168618-0024 HE HAD NO SACK BUT EVIDENTLY HE HAD LARGE POCKETS UNDER HIS COAT FROM TIME TO TIME HE HALTED SCRUTINIZED THE PLAIN AROUND HIM AS THOUGH TO SEE WHETHER HE WERE OBSERVED BENT OVER ABRUPTLY
3656-168618-0025 DISTURBED SOMETHING SILENT AND MOTIONLESS ON THE GROUND THEN ROSE AND FLED HIS SLIDING MOTION HIS ATTITUDES HIS MYSTERIOUS AND RAPID GESTURES
3656-168618-0026 AND WHICH ANCIENT NORMAN LEGENDS CALL THE ALLEURS CERTAIN NOCTURNAL WADING BIRDS PRODUCE THESE SILHOUETTES AMONG THE MARSHES A GLANCE CAPABLE OF PIERCING ALL THAT MIST DEEPLY WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED AT SOME DISTANCE
3656-168618-0027 A SORT OF LITTLE SUTLER'S WAGON WITH A FLUTED WICKER HOOD HARNESSED TO A FAMISHED NAG WHICH WAS CROPPING THE GRASS ACROSS ITS BIT AS IT HALTED HIDDEN AS IT WERE
3656-168618-0028 AT THE ANGLE OF THE ROAD FROM MONT SAINT JEAN TO BRAINE L'ALLEUD
3656-168618-0029 PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT WAGON AND THAT PROWLER THE DARKNESS WAS SERENE NOT A CLOUD IN THE ZENITH
3656-168618-0030 THE MOON REMAINS WHITE THESE ARE THE INDIFFERENCES OF THE SKY IN THE FIELDS BRANCHES OF TREES BROKEN BY GRAPE SHOT BUT NOT FALLEN UPHELD BY THEIR BARK SWAYED GENTLY IN THE BREEZE OF NIGHT
3656-168618-0031 MOVED THE SHRUBBERY QUIVERS WHICH RESEMBLED THE DEPARTURE OF SOULS RAN THROUGH THE GRASS IN THE DISTANCE THE COMING AND GOING OF PATROLS AND THE GENERAL ROUNDS OF THE ENGLISH CAMP WERE AUDIBLE
3656-168618-0032 FORMING ONE IN THE WEST THE OTHER IN THE EAST TWO GREAT FLAMES WHICH WERE JOINED BY THE CORDON OF BIVOUAC FIRES OF THE ENGLISH LIKE A NECKLACE OF RUBIES WITH TWO CARBUNCLES AT THE EXTREMITIES AS THEY EXTENDED IN AN IMMENSE SEMICIRCLE OVER THE HILLS ALONG THE HORIZON
3656-168618-0033 THE HEART IS TERRIFIED AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT THAT DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN TO SO MANY BRAVE MEN IF THERE IS ANYTHING TERRIBLE
3656-168618-0034 IT IS THIS TO LIVE TO SEE THE SUN TO BE IN FULL POSSESSION OF VIRILE FORCE TO POSSESS HEALTH AND JOY TO LAUGH VALIANTLY TO RUSH TOWARDS A GLORY WHICH ONE SEES DAZZLING IN FRONT OF ONE
3656-168618-0035 TO FEEL IN ONE'S BREAST LUNGS WHICH BREATHE A HEART WHICH BEATS A WILL WHICH REASONS TO SPEAK THINK HOPE LOVE TO HAVE A MOTHER TO HAVE A WIFE TO HAVE CHILDREN
3656-168618-0036 TO HAVE THE LIGHT AND ALL AT ONCE IN THE SPACE OF A SHOUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE TO SINK INTO AN ABYSS TO FALL TO ROLL TO CRUSH TO BE CRUSHED TO SEE EARS OF WHEAT
3656-168618-0037 FLOWERS LEAVES BRANCHES NOT TO BE ABLE TO CATCH HOLD OF ANYTHING TO FEEL ONE'S SWORD USELESS MEN BENEATH ONE HORSES ON TOP OF ONE
3656-168618-0038 TO STRUGGLE IN VAIN SINCE ONE'S BONES HAVE BEEN BROKEN BY SOME KICK IN THE DARKNESS TO FEEL A HEEL WHICH MAKES ONE'S EYES START FROM THEIR SOCKETS TO BITE HORSES SHOES IN ONE'S RAGE TO STIFLE TO YELL
3656-168618-0039 TO BE BENEATH AND TO SAY TO ONE'S SELF BUT JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO I WAS A LIVING MAN THERE WHERE THAT LAMENTABLE DISASTER HAD UTTERED ITS DEATH RATTLE ALL WAS SILENCE NOW
3656-168618-0040 THE EDGES OF THE HOLLOW ROAD WERE ENCUMBERED WITH HORSES AND RIDERS INEXTRICABLY HEAPED UP TERRIBLE ENTANGLEMENT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY SLOPE FOR THE CORPSES HAD LEVELLED THE ROAD WITH THE PLAIN
3656-168618-0041 AND REACHED THE BRIM LIKE A WELL FILLED BUSHEL OF BARLEY A HEAP OF DEAD BODIES IN THE UPPER PART A RIVER OF BLOOD IN THE LOWER PART SUCH WAS THAT ROAD ON THE EVENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN
3656-168618-0042 AND THERE OVERFLOWED IN A LARGE POOL IN FRONT OF THE ABATIS OF TREES WHICH BARRED THE WAY AT A SPOT WHICH IS STILL POINTED OUT IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS AT THE OPPOSITE POINT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GENAPPE ROAD
3656-168618-0043 THE THICKNESS OF THE LAYER OF BODIES WAS PROPORTIONED TO THE DEPTH OF THE HOLLOW ROAD TOWARDS THE MIDDLE AT THE POINT WHERE IT BECAME LEVEL WHERE DELORT'S DIVISION HAD PASSED THE LAYER OF CORPSES WAS THINNER
3656-168618-0044 THE NOCTURNAL PROWLER WHOM WE HAVE JUST SHOWN TO THE READER WAS GOING IN THAT DIRECTION HE WAS SEARCHING THAT VAST TOMB HE GAZED ABOUT HE PASSED THE DEAD IN SOME SORT OF HIDEOUS REVIEW HE WALKED WITH HIS FEET IN THE BLOOD
3656-168618-0045 ALL AT ONCE HE PAUSED A FEW PACES IN FRONT OF HIM IN THE HOLLOW ROAD AT THE POINT WHERE THE PILE OF DEAD CAME TO AN END AN OPEN HAND ILLUMINED BY THE MOON PROJECTED FROM BENEATH THAT HEAP OF MEN
3656-168618-0046 THAT HAND HAD ON ITS FINGER SOMETHING SPARKLING WHICH WAS A RING OF GOLD THE MAN BENT OVER REMAINED IN A CROUCHING ATTITUDE FOR A MOMENT AND WHEN HE ROSE THERE WAS NO LONGER A RING ON THE HAND
3656-168618-0047 HE DID NOT PRECISELY RISE HE REMAINED IN A STOOPING AND FRIGHTENED ATTITUDE WITH HIS BACK TURNED TO THE HEAP OF DEAD SCANNING THE HORIZON ON HIS KNEES WITH THE WHOLE UPPER PORTION OF HIS BODY SUPPORTED ON HIS TWO FOREFINGERS
3656-168618-0048 WHICH RESTED ON THE EARTH AND HIS HEAD PEERING ABOVE THE EDGE OF THE HOLLOW ROAD THE JACKAL'S FOUR PAWS SUIT SOME ACTIONS
3656-168618-0049 AT THAT MOMENT HE GAVE A TERRIBLE START HE FELT SOME ONE CLUTCH HIM FROM BEHIND HE WHEELED ROUND IT WAS THE OPEN HAND WHICH HAD CLOSED AND HAD SEIZED THE SKIRT OF HIS COAT AN HONEST MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIFIED
3656-168618-0050 THIS MAN BURST INTO A LAUGH COME SAID HE IT'S ONLY A DEAD BODY
3656-168618-0051 BUT THE HAND WEAKENED AND RELEASED HIM EFFORT IS QUICKLY EXHAUSTED IN THE GRAVE WELL NOW SAID THE PROWLER IS THAT DEAD FELLOW ALIVE LET'S SEE HE BENT DOWN AGAIN FUMBLED AMONG THE HEAP
3656-168618-0052 PUSHED ASIDE EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN HIS WAY SEIZED THE HAND GRASPED THE ARM FREED THE HEAD PULLED OUT THE BODY AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE WAS DRAGGING THE LIFELESS OR AT LEAST THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN THROUGH THE SHADOWS OF HOLLOW ROAD
3656-168618-0053 AN OFFICER AND EVEN AN OFFICER OF CONSIDERABLE RANK
3656-168618-0054 THIS OFFICER NO LONGER POSSESSED A HELMET A FURIOUS SWORD CUT HAD SCARRED HIS FACE WHERE NOTHING WAS DISCERNIBLE BUT BLOOD HOWEVER HE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY BROKEN LIMBS AND BY SOME HAPPY CHANCE IF THAT WORD IS PERMISSIBLE HERE
3656-168618-0055 THE DEAD HAD BEEN VAULTED ABOVE HIM IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRESERVE HIM FROM BEING CRUSHED HIS EYES WERE STILL CLOSED
3656-168618-0056 THE PROWLER TORE OFF THIS CROSS WHICH DISAPPEARED INTO ONE OF THE GULFS WHICH HE HAD BENEATH HIS GREAT COAT THEN HE FELT OF THE OFFICER'S FOB DISCOVERED A WATCH THERE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF IT NEXT HE SEARCHED HIS WAISTCOAT FOUND A PURSE AND POCKETED IT
3656-168618-0057 WHICH HE WAS ADMINISTERING TO THIS DYING MAN THE OFFICER OPENED HIS EYES THANKS HE SAID FEEBLY THE ABRUPTNESS OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MAN WHO WAS MANIPULATING HIM THE FRESHNESS OF THE NIGHT THE AIR WHICH HE COULD INHALE FREELY
3656-168618-0058 HAD ROUSED HIM FROM HIS LETHARGY THE PROWLER MADE NO REPLY HE RAISED HIS HEAD A SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS WAS AUDIBLE IN THE PLAIN SOME PATROL WAS PROBABLY APPROACHING THE OFFICER MURMURED FOR THE DEATH AGONY WAS STILL IN HIS VOICE
3656-168618-0059 THE ENGLISH ANSWERED THE PROWLER THE OFFICER WENT ON LOOK IN MY POCKETS YOU WILL FIND A WATCH AND A PURSE TAKE THEM IT WAS ALREADY DONE
3656-168618-0060 THE PROWLER EXECUTED THE REQUIRED FEINT AND SAID THERE IS NOTHING THERE I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SAID THE OFFICER I AM SORRY FOR THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD THEM
3656-168618-0061 THE STEPS OF THE PATROL BECAME MORE AND MORE DISTINCT SOME ONE IS COMING SAID THE PROWLER WITH THE MOVEMENT OF A MAN WHO IS TAKING HIS DEPARTURE THE OFFICER RAISED HIS ARM FEEBLY AND DETAINED HIM
