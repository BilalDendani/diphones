8180-274725-0000 ALAS THAT HIS HAD NOT BEEN A MORE GUILELESS EVE THE LOVE MAKING WAS PATENT TO EVERY ONE AND THE FAMILY AT THE FARM WONDERED WHERE IT WOULD END MARK BRACE WAS TRULY SORRY THAT EARLE HAD SET HIS HEART ON THE LOVELY FANTASTIC DORIS AND YET
8180-274725-0001 HONEST MAN HE DID NOT WONDER THAT ANY YOUNG FELLOW SHOULD BE BEGUILED BY SO FAIR A FACE AND HE COULD NOT BUT BE HEARTILY AMUSED AT THE QUEENLY AIRS WITH WHICH THE FARM FOUNDLING BELIEVING HERSELF A TENANT FARMER'S CHILD RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF EARLE MORAY
8180-274725-0002 POET AND GENTLEMAN OWNER OF THE LITTLE ESTATE OF LINDENHOLM GOOD PATTY BRACE WAS ON HER PART GREATLY PERPLEXED WITH WOMAN'S KEEN INTUITION IN LOVE SHE PERCEIVED THE INTENSE SINCERITY OF EARLE'S PASSION FOR DORIS
8180-274725-0003 AND SAW AS WELL THAT DORIS WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT HEART FOR HIM THE GIRL ADMIRED HIM LOVED HIS FLATTERY DESIRED TO BE SOME ONE'S CHIEF OBJECT BUT WOULD HAVE TOSSED HIM ASIDE AS EASILY AS AN OLD GLOVE IF A MORE DASHING ADORER HAD MADE HIS APPEARANCE
8180-274725-0004 BESIDES IF DORIS GAVE CONSENT TO EARLE'S WOOING WOULD MISSUS MORAY BE WELL PLEASED WITH HER SON'S CHOICE MISSUS MORAY OF LINDENHOLM WAS A THOROUGHLY PRACTICAL WOMAN AND WOULD SEE AT A GLANCE THAT THE IDLE YOUNG BEAUTY WOULD BE A VERY UNRELIABLE WIFE FOR ANY MAN
8180-274725-0005 ESPECIALLY FOR ONE OF MODERATE MEANS WHAT FOOLS MEN ARE IN LOVE MATTERS QUOTH PATTY TO HERSELF AT LEAST MOST MEN WITH A THOUGHT BACKWARD TO MARK'S SENSIBLE CHOOSING THIS DREAMER AND VERSE WRITER WOULD HAVE DONE WELL TO CHOOSE OUR MATTIE
8180-274725-0006 WHO WOULD HELP HIM ON AND MAKE HIM HAPPY HIS LIFE LONG BUT DORIS IS ONLY FIT TO MARRY A LORD AS NO DOUBT SHE SPRUNG FROM A LORD BUT WHERE A LORD IS TO COME FROM AS A SUITOR GOODNESS KNOWS NOT I AND OF ALL WHO SAW THE SUMMER WOOING
8180-274725-0007 MATTIE WAS THE MOST DEEPLY TOUCHED BUT GAVE NO SIGN WHEN SHE FELT THE SHARPNESS OF THE PAIN WHEN DORIS ASSERTED EMPIRE OVER EARLE THEN MATTIE FIRST GUESSED THAT SHE HAD SET HER LOVE UPON HIM AND SHE GAVE HERSELF THE TASK OF ROOTING OUT LOVER'S LOVE
8180-274725-0008 AND PLANTING SISTERLY AFFECTION IN ITS STEAD HER GENTLE FACE GREW GRAVER HER SOFT BROWN EYES HAD A MORE WISTFUL LIGHT BUT NOT A THOUGHT OF JEALOUSY OR ANGER OR ENVY
8180-274725-0009 GOD WAS GOOD TO MATTIE IN THAT NO ILL WEEDS THROVE IN HER MAIDEN SOUL DORIS DID NOT FIND THE SWEETNESS SHE HAD EXPECTED IN TORMENTING HER FOR MATTIE GAVE NO SIGNS OF TORMENT RATHER FOR EARLE THAN FOR HERSELF SHE WAS SAD
8180-274725-0010 AND THAT WITH REASON IT IS SAD TO SEE A YOUNG MAN LOVE ABSORBINGLY MADLY GIVING UP ALL FOR LOVE DORIS BECAME HIS ONE IDEA EVEN HIS MOTHER WHILE SHE KNEW HE WAS ATTRACTED BY A PRETTY DAUGHTER OF MARK BRACE
8180-274725-0011 DID NOT GUESS HIS INFATUATION SCARCELY AN HOUR IN THE DAY WERE THE YOUNG PAIR PARTED EARLE HAD TOLD DORIS OF THE POET'S OLD RECIPE FOR A LOVELY COMPLEXION WASHING IN MORNING DEW AND DORIS TO PRESERVE THE MOST EXQUISITE COMPLEXION IN THE WORLD
8180-274725-0012 WENT OUT WHEN THE SUN ROSE TO BATHE HER CHEEKS AND BROW WITH THE OTHER LILIES AND ROSES IN THE DEWS OF THE DAWNING EARLE MET HER AND RAMBLED WITH HER THROUGH FLOWERY LANES WHEN HIS SUPPOSED STUDIES IN FARMING BEGAN
8180-274725-0013 HE WAS RATHER LOUNGING AT THE FEET OF DORIS THAN LEARNING OF MARK BRACE YET SO EAGERLY DID HE HURRY OFF TO THE FARM THAT HIS MOTHER BLESSED HIS UNWONTED ATTENTION TO HIS DUTY HE DINED AT HOME NOT TO LEAVE HIS MOTHER LONELY THEN OFF AGAIN
8180-274725-0014 AND HIS FARM STUDIES CONSISTED IN READING POETRY OR TALES TO DORIS UNDER TREES OR WANDERING FAR INTO THE GLOAMING WITH HER IN BRACKENSIDE GARDEN HIS HEART POURED ITSELF OUT IN HERRICK'S GRAND OLD SONG TO ANTHEA
8180-274725-0015 THOU ART MY LIFE MY SOUL MY HEART THE VERY EYES OF ME THOU HAST COMMAND OF EVERY PART TO LIVE AND DIE FOR THEE HIS RICH YOUNG VOICE ROLLED FORTH THESE WORDS WITH DEEP FEELING DORIS LAUGHED AT THE SONG AT FIRST
8180-274725-0016 BUT HIS EARNESTNESS IN SINGING IT TOUCHED HER A VERY LITTLE I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU WHEN I HEAR THAT SONG SHE SAID THINK OF ME YES BUT IF IT MEANS THAT WE ARE TO BE PARTED AND YOU THINK JUST TO REMEMBER DORIS I SHOULD DIE
8180-274725-0017 HE WAS FERVID HANDSOME ROMANTIC BRILLIANT IN LOVE'S FIRST GOLDEN GLOW HARD TO RESIST SHE SMILED AT HIM LET US FANCY WE WILL NOT BE PARTED SHE SAID SWEETLY
8180-274725-0018 EARLE CAME HURRYING UP ONE DAY AFTER DINNER NOW FOR A LONG EVENING IN THE GARDEN HE CRIED I HAVE BROUGHT A NEW DRAMA THE POETRY IS EXQUISITE WE WILL SIT IN THE ARBOR UNDER THE HONEYSUCKLE
8180-274725-0019 AND WHILE THE SUMMER WIND IS FULL OF THE BREATH OF FLOWERS I WILL READ YOU THE SWEETER BREATHING OF A POET'S SOUL COME DORIS COME MATTIE LET US OFF TO THE GARDEN MATTIE'S FACE FLUSHED WITH JOY IT WAS SO SWEET TO FIND SOME PLEASURE SHE COULD SHARE WITH HIM
8180-274725-0020 HIS VOICE WAS FULL OF FIRE AND MUSIC MATTIE LISTENED ENTRANCED DORIS HALF FORGOT HER FAVORITE DREAMS OF HERSELF IN GORGEOUS CROWDS THE CENTER OF ADMIRATION THE GLOAMING FELL AS HE READ THE LAST LINES
8180-274725-0021 IT IS BEAUTIFUL IN ITS POETRY SAID MATTIE BUT NOT IN ITS IDEA I CANNOT LOVE THE HEROINE THOUGH HER FACE IS FAIR BEAUTY SHOULD BE UNITED TO GOODNESS AND GOODNESS HAS NOT THIS CRUEL PRIDE
8180-274725-0022 TO THINK OF A WOMAN WHO WOULD LET A BRAVE MAN DIE OR RISK DEATH TO WIN A SMILE I ALWAYS HATED THE LADY WHO THREW THE GLOVE AND I THINK THE KNIGHT SERVED HER WELL TO LEAVE HER WHEN HE RETURNED THE GLOVE FOR SHE HAD NO IDEA OF TRUE LOVE
8180-274725-0023 BEAUTY HAS A RIGHT TO ALL TRIUMPHS CRIED DORIS AND MEN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN READY TO DIE FOR BEAUTY'S SMILE A GOOD MAN'S LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN ANY WOMAN'S SMILE SAID MATTIE THE MAN'S LIFE THE WOMAN'S LIFE ARE HEAVEN'S GIFTS
8180-274725-0024 TO BE SPENT IN DOING GOOD WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO THROW THEM IDLY AWAY OR DEMAND THEIR SACRIFICE I NEVER LIKED THESE STORIES OF WASTED AFFECTION THEY ARE TOO PITIFUL TO GIVE ALL AND GET NOTHING IS A CRUEL FATE
8180-274725-0025 OH YOU LITTLE SILLY COUNTRY GIRL LAUGHED DORIS YOU DO NOT THINK THAT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN ARE QUEENS AND HEARTS ARE THEIR RIGHTFUL KINGDOM AND THEY CAN GET AS MANY AS THEY LIKE AND DO WHAT THEY PLEASE WITH THEM YOU TALK TO AMUSE YOURSELF SAID EARLE
8180-274725-0026 THAT SWEET SMILE AND VOICE FIT YOUR CRUEL WORDS AS LITTLE AS THEY WOULD SUIT AN EXECUTIONER'S SWORD WHAT IS SLAYING BY TREACHERY IN LOVE BETTER THAN MURDER ASKED MATTIE EAGERLY
8180-274725-0027 IT IS A VERY EXCITING PIQUANT INTERESTING FORM OF MURDER RETORTED HER WICKED LITTLE SISTER HOW CAN ANY ONE ENJOY GIVING PAIN CRIED MATTIE I HAVE READ OF SUCH WOMEN BUT TO ME THEY SEEM TRUE DEMONS HOWEVER FAIR THINK OF DESTROYING HOPE
8180-274725-0028 LIFE GENIUS MORALS FOR WHAT FOR AMUSEMENT AND YET THESE SONS ALL HAD MOTHERS YOU ARE IN EARNEST MATTIE SAID EARLE ADMIRINGLY I FEEL IN EARNEST SAID MATTIE PASSIONATELY
8180-274725-0029 PSHAW THERE IS MUCH SPIDER AND FLY IN MEN AND WOMEN LAUGHED DORIS WOMEN WEAVE SILVERY NETS IN THE SUN AND THE SILLY MEN WALK STRAIGHT IN WHO'S TO BLAME YOU TALK LIKE A WORN OUT FRENCH CYNIC CRIED MATTIE
8180-274725-0030 WELL WHO IS TO BLAME PERSISTED DORIS PRETTY WOMEN FOR JUST AMUSING THEMSELVES ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURES OR SILLY MEN FOR WALKING INTO DANGER BEING WARNED IT SHOULD NOT BE A WOMAN'S NATURE TO SET TRAPS FOR HEARTS OR SOULS
8180-274725-0031 YOU KNOW BETTER DORIS URGED MATTIE IF I COULD BE RICH AND GREAT AND GO TO LONDON AND LIVE IN SOCIETY YOU'D SEE IF I WOULD DO BETTER RETORTED DORIS YOU TWO REMIND ME OF VERSES OF A POEM ON TWO SISTERS SAID EARLE THEIR LIVES LAY FAR APART
8180-274725-0032 ONE SOUGHT THE GILDED WORLD AND THERE BECAME A BEING FIT TO STARTLE AND SURPRISE TILL MEN MOVED TO THE ECHOES OF HER NAME AND BOWED BENEATH THE MAGIC OF HER EYES
8180-274725-0033 BUT SHE THE OTHER WITH A HAPPIER CHOICE DWELT MONG THE BREEZES OF HER NATIVE FIELDS LAUGHED WITH THE BROOKS AND SAW THE FLOWERS REJOICE BRIMMED WITH ALL SWEETNESS THAT THE SUMMER YIELDS THAT THEN IS MATTIE
8180-274725-0034 MATTIE LOOKED UP IN GRATIFIED SURPRISE IF YOU ARE COMPLIMENTING MATTIE I WON'T STAY AND HEAR IT I REIGN ALONE CRIED DORIS HALF LAUGHING HALF PETULANT
8180-274725-0035 IT WAS OFTEN SO WHEN SHE HAD SUNNED EARLE WITH HER SMILES SHE WITHDREW HER PRESENCE OR CHANGED SMILES TO FROWNS SO HE WAS NEVER CLOYED WITH TOO MUCH SWEETNESS WHEN DORIS WITHDREW IN VAIN HE SANG UNDER THE WINDOW OR SENT HER LOVE FULL NOTES
