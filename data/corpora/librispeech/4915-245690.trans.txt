4915-245690-0000 QUESTION SEVENTY EIGHT OF THE SPECIFIC POWERS OF THE SOUL IN FOUR ARTICLES WE NEXT TREAT OF THE POWERS OF THE SOUL SPECIFICALLY THE THEOLOGIAN HOWEVER HAS ONLY TO INQUIRE SPECIFICALLY CONCERNING THE INTELLECTUAL AND APPETITIVE POWERS
4915-245690-0001 IN WHICH THE VIRTUES RESIDE AND SINCE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THESE POWERS DEPENDS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ON THE OTHER POWERS OUR CONSIDERATION OF THE POWERS OF THE SOUL TAKEN SPECIFICALLY WILL BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS
4915-245690-0002 FIRST WE SHALL CONSIDER THOSE POWERS WHICH ARE A PREAMBLE TO THE INTELLECT SECONDLY THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS THIRDLY THE APPETITIVE POWERS UNDER THE FIRST HEAD THERE ARE FOUR POINTS OF INQUIRY
4915-245690-0003 ONE THE POWERS OF THE SOUL CONSIDERED GENERALLY TWO THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF THE VEGETATIVE PART THREE THE EXTERIOR SENSES
4915-245690-0004 BUT ONLY THREE PARTS OF THE SOUL ARE COMMONLY ASSIGNED NAMELY THE VEGETATIVE SOUL THE SENSITIVE SOUL AND THE RATIONAL SOUL THEREFORE THERE ARE ONLY THREE GENERA OF POWERS IN THE SOUL AND NOT FIVE
4915-245690-0005 FURTHER THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF ITS VITAL OPERATIONS NOW IN FOUR WAYS IS A THING SAID TO LIVE FOR THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
4915-245690-0006 IN SEVERAL WAYS A THING IS SAID TO LIVE AND EVEN IF ONLY ONE OF THESE IS PRESENT THE THING IS SAID TO LIVE AS INTELLECT AND SENSE LOCAL MOVEMENT AND REST AND LASTLY MOVEMENT OF DECREASE AND INCREASE DUE TO NOURISHMENT
4915-245690-0007 THEREFORE THERE ARE ONLY FOUR GENERA OF POWERS OF THE SOUL AS THE APPETITIVE IS EXCLUDED
4915-245690-0008 FURTHER A SPECIAL KIND OF SOUL OUGHT NOT TO BE ASSIGNED AS REGARDS WHAT IS COMMON TO ALL THE POWERS NOW DESIRE IS COMMON TO EACH POWER OF THE SOUL FOR SIGHT DESIRES AN APPROPRIATE VISIBLE OBJECT WHENCE WE READ
4915-245690-0009 BUT MORE THAN THESE GREEN SOWN FIELDS IN THE SAME WAY EVERY OTHER POWER DESIRES ITS APPROPRIATE OBJECT THEREFORE THE APPETITIVE POWER SHOULD NOT BE MADE A SPECIAL GENUS OF THE POWERS OF THE SOUL
4915-245690-0010 FURTHER THE MOVING PRINCIPLE IN ANIMALS IS SENSE INTELLECT OR APPETITE AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
4915-245690-0011 TEN THEREFORE THE MOTIVE POWER SHOULD NOT BE ADDED TO THE ABOVE AS A SPECIAL GENUS OF SOUL
4915-245690-0012 THE POWERS ARE THE VEGETATIVE THE SENSITIVE THE APPETITIVE THE LOCOMOTION AND THE INTELLECTUAL I ANSWER THAT THERE ARE FIVE GENERA OF POWERS OF THE SOUL AS ABOVE NUMBERED
4915-245690-0013 OF THESE THREE ARE CALLED SOULS AND FOUR ARE CALLED MODES OF LIVING THE REASON OF THIS DIVERSITY LIES IN THE VARIOUS SOULS BEING DISTINGUISHED ACCORDINGLY
4915-245690-0014 AND IS RELATED TO IT AS ITS MATTER AND INSTRUMENT
4915-245690-0015 AND SUCH IS THE OPERATION OF THE RATIONAL SOUL BELOW THIS THERE IS ANOTHER OPERATION OF THE SOUL WHICH IS INDEED PERFORMED
4915-245690-0016 AND THIS IS THE OPERATION OF THE SENSITIVE SOUL FOR THOUGH HOT AND COLD WET AND DRY
4915-245690-0017 YET THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SENSES TAKES PLACE BY VIRTUE OF SUCH QUALITIES BUT ONLY FOR THE PROPER DISPOSITION OF THE ORGAN THE LOWEST OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE SOUL
4915-245690-0018 BECAUSE THE MOVEMENTS OF BODIES ARE CAUSED BY AN EXTRINSIC PRINCIPLE WHILE THESE OPERATIONS ARE FROM AN INTRINSIC PRINCIPLE FOR THIS IS COMMON TO ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE SOUL SINCE EVERY ANIMATE THING IN SOME WAY MOVES ITSELF
4915-245690-0019 SUCH IS THE OPERATION OF THE VEGETATIVE SOUL FOR DIGESTION AND WHAT FOLLOWS IS CAUSED INSTRUMENTALLY BY THE ACTION OF HEAT
4915-245690-0020 NOW THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE DISTINGUISHED GENERICALLY BY THEIR OBJECTS FOR THE HIGHER A POWER IS THE MORE UNIVERSAL IS THE OBJECT TO WHICH IT EXTENDS AS WE HAVE SAID ABOVE
4915-245690-0021 AD FOUR BUT THE OBJECT OF THE SOUL'S OPERATION MAY BE CONSIDERED IN A TRIPLE ORDER FOR IN THE SOUL THERE IS A POWER THE OBJECT OF WHICH IS ONLY THE BODY THAT IS UNITED TO THAT SOUL
4915-245690-0022 THE POWERS OF THIS GENUS ARE CALLED VEGETATIVE FOR THE VEGETATIVE POWER ACTS ONLY ON THE BODY TO WHICH THE SOUL IS UNITED THERE IS ANOTHER GENUS IN THE POWERS OF THE SOUL WHICH GENUS REGARDS A MORE UNIVERSAL OBJECT
4915-245690-0023 NAMELY EVERY SENSIBLE BODY NOT ONLY THE BODY TO WHICH THE SOUL IS UNITED AND THERE IS YET ANOTHER GENUS IN THE POWERS OF THE SOUL WHICH GENUS REGARDS A STILL MORE UNIVERSAL OBJECT NAMELY NOT ONLY THE SENSIBLE BODY
4915-245690-0024 BUT ALL BEING IN UNIVERSAL WHEREFORE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE LATTER TWO GENERA OF THE SOUL'S POWERS HAVE AN OPERATION IN REGARD NOT MERELY TO THAT WHICH IS UNITED TO THEM BUT ALSO TO SOMETHING EXTRINSIC
4915-245690-0025 NOW SINCE WHATEVER OPERATES MUST IN SOME WAY BE UNITED TO THE OBJECT ABOUT WHICH IT OPERATES IT FOLLOWS OF NECESSITY THAT THIS SOMETHING EXTRINSIC WHICH IS THE OBJECT OF THE SOUL'S OPERATION MUST BE RELATED TO THE SOUL IN A TWOFOLD MANNER
4915-245690-0026 FIRST INASMUCH AS THIS SOMETHING EXTRINSIC HAS A NATURAL APTITUDE TO BE UNITED TO THE SOUL AND TO BE BY ITS LIKENESS IN THE SOUL IN THIS WAY THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF POWERS NAMELY THE SENSITIVE IN REGARD TO THE LESS COMMON OBJECT
4915-245690-0027 THE SENSIBLE BODY AND THE INTELLECTUAL IN REGARD TO THE MOST COMMON OBJECT UNIVERSAL BEING SECONDLY FORASMUCH AS THE SOUL ITSELF HAS AN INCLINATION AND TENDENCY TO THE SOMETHING EXTRINSIC
4915-245690-0028 AND IN THIS WAY THERE ARE AGAIN TWO KINDS OF POWERS IN THE SOUL ONE THE APPETITIVE IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE SOUL IS REFERRED TO SOMETHING EXTRINSIC AS TO AN END WHICH IS FIRST IN THE INTENTION THE OTHER THE LOCOMOTIVE POWER
4915-245690-0029 IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE SOUL IS REFERRED TO SOMETHING EXTRINSIC AS TO THE TERM OF ITS OPERATION AND MOVEMENT FOR EVERY ANIMAL IS MOVED FOR THE PURPOSE OF REALIZING ITS DESIRES AND INTENTIONS
4915-245690-0030 THE MODES OF LIVING ARE DISTINGUISHED ACCORDING TO THE DEGREES OF LIVING THINGS THERE ARE SOME LIVING THINGS IN WHICH THERE EXISTS ONLY VEGETATIVE POWER AS THE PLANTS THERE ARE OTHERS IN WHICH WITH THE VEGETATIVE THERE EXISTS ALSO THE SENSITIVE
4915-245690-0031 BUT NOT THE LOCOMOTIVE POWER SUCH AS IMMOVABLE ANIMALS AS SHELLFISH THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH BESIDES THIS HAVE LOCOMOTIVE POWERS AS PERFECT ANIMALS
4915-245690-0032 AND THERE ARE SOME LIVING THINGS WHICH WITH THESE HAVE INTELLECTUAL POWER NAMELY MEN BUT THE APPETITIVE POWER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A DEGREE OF LIVING THINGS BECAUSE WHEREVER THERE IS SENSE THERE IS ALSO APPETITE
4915-245690-0033 THUS THE FIRST TWO OBJECTIONS ARE HEREBY SOLVED
4915-245690-0034 THE NATURAL APPETITE IS THAT INCLINATION WHICH EACH THING HAS OF ITS OWN NATURE FOR SOMETHING WHEREFORE BY ITS NATURAL APPETITE EACH POWER DESIRES SOMETHING SUITABLE TO ITSELF BUT THE ANIMAL APPETITE
4915-245690-0035 RESULTS FROM THE FORM APPREHENDED THIS SORT OF APPETITE REQUIRES A SPECIAL POWER OF THE SOUL MERE APPREHENSION DOES NOT SUFFICE FOR A THING IS DESIRED AS IT EXISTS IN ITS OWN NATURE
4915-245690-0036 WHEREAS IN THE APPREHENSIVE POWER IT EXISTS NOT ACCORDING TO ITS OWN NATURE BUT ACCORDING TO ITS LIKENESS WHENCE IT IS CLEAR THAT SIGHT DESIRES NATURALLY A VISIBLE OBJECT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ITS ACT ONLY
4915-245690-0037 NAMELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEING BUT THE ANIMAL BY THE APPETITIVE POWER DESIRES THE THING SEEN NOT MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEING IT BUT ALSO FOR OTHER PURPOSES BUT IF THE SOUL DID NOT REQUIRE THINGS PERCEIVED BY THE SENSES
4915-245690-0038 EXCEPT ON ACCOUNT OF THE ACTIONS OF THE SENSES THAT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENSING THEM THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR A SPECIAL GENUS OF APPETITIVE POWERS SINCE THE NATURAL APPETITE OF THE POWERS WOULD SUFFICE
4915-245690-0039 ALTHOUGH SENSE AND APPETITE ARE PRINCIPLES OF MOVEMENT IN PERFECT ANIMALS YET SENSE AND APPETITE AS SUCH ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE MOVEMENT UNLESS ANOTHER POWER BE ADDED TO THEM
4915-245690-0040 FOR IMMOVABLE ANIMALS HAVE SENSE AND APPETITE AND YET THEY HAVE NOT THE POWER OF MOTION NOW THIS MOTIVE POWER IS NOT ONLY IN THE APPETITE AND SENSE AS COMMANDING THE MOVEMENT BUT ALSO IN THE PARTS OF THE BODY
4915-245690-0041 OF THIS WE HAVE A SIGN IN THE FACT THAT WHEN THE MEMBERS ARE DEPRIVED OF THEIR NATURAL DISPOSITION
4915-245690-0042 ARE NOT FITTINGLY DESCRIBED NAMELY THE NUTRITIVE AUGMENTATIVE AND GENERATIVE FOR THESE ARE CALLED NATURAL FORCES BUT THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE ABOVE THE NATURAL FORCES THEREFORE WE SHOULD NOT CLASS THE ABOVE FORCES AS POWERS OF THE SOUL
4915-245690-0043 FURTHER WE SHOULD NOT ASSIGN A PARTICULAR POWER OF THE SOUL TO THAT WHICH IS COMMON TO LIVING AND NON LIVING THINGS BUT GENERATION IS COMMON TO ALL THINGS THAT CAN BE GENERATED AND CORRUPTED WHETHER LIVING OR NOT LIVING
4915-245690-0044 THEREFORE THE GENERATIVE FORCE SHOULD NOT BE CLASSED AS A POWER OF THE SOUL
4915-245690-0045 FURTHER THE SOUL IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE BODY BUT THE BODY BY THE SAME FORCE GIVES SPECIES AND QUANTITY MUCH MORE THEREFORE DOES THE SOUL THEREFORE THE AUGMENTATIVE POWER OF THE SOUL IS NOT DISTINCT FROM THE GENERATIVE POWER
4915-245690-0046 FURTHER EVERYTHING IS PRESERVED IN BEING BY THAT WHEREBY IT EXISTS BUT THE GENERATIVE POWER IS THAT WHEREBY A LIVING THING EXISTS THEREFORE BY THE SAME POWER THE LIVING THING IS PRESERVED
