5604-26982-0000 WHY TITO WAS SAFE TITO HAD GOOD REASONS FOR SAYING THAT HE WAS SAFE
5604-26982-0001 HE HAD HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH RESOURCES HE HAD BEEN STRENGTHENING HIS INFLUENCE AT ROME AND AT MILAN BY BEING THE MEDIUM OF SECRET INFORMATION AND INDIRECT MEASURES AGAINST THE FRATE AND THE POPULAR PARTY
5604-26982-0002 HE HAD CULTIVATED MORE ASSIDUOUSLY THAN EVER THE REGARD OF THIS PARTY BY SHOWING SUBTLE EVIDENCE THAT HIS POLITICAL CONVICTIONS WERE ENTIRELY ON THEIR SIDE AND ALL THE WHILE
5604-26982-0003 HEREDITARY INTERESTS ALLIANCES AND PREJUDICES
5604-26982-0004 WHO WERE THE BITTEREST ENEMIES OF SAVONAROLA CARRIED ON A SYSTEM OF UNDERHAND CORRESPONDENCE AND ESPIONAGE IN WHICH THE DEEPEST HYPOCRISY WAS THE BEST SERVICE AND DEMANDED THE HEAVIEST PAY
5604-26982-0005 WERE THE MORE INCLINED TO CREDIT TITO WITH SINCERITY IN HIS POLITICAL ADHESION TO THEM BECAUSE HE AFFECTED NO RELIGIOUS SYMPATHIES BY VIRTUE OF THESE CONDITIONS THE LAST THREE MONTHS HAD BEEN A TIME OF FLATTERING SUCCESS TO TITO
5604-26982-0006 AND THE REWARDS OF TALENT AND LEARNING WERE MORE SPLENDID AT PRESENT THE SCALE DIPPED IN FAVOUR OF MILAN AND IF WITHIN THE YEAR HE COULD RENDER CERTAIN SERVICES TO DUKE LUDOVICO SFORZA
5604-26982-0007 THE ARREST OF LAMBERTO DELL ANTELLA WITH A TELL TALE LETTER ON HIS PERSON AND A BITTER RANCOUR AGAINST THE MEDICI IN HIS HEART WAS AN INCALCULABLE EVENT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN SPITE OF THE CAREFUL PRETEXTS WITH WHICH HIS AGENCY HAD BEEN GUARDED THAT TITO SHOULD ESCAPE IMPLICATION
5604-26982-0008 BUT HIS QUICK MIND HAD SOON TRACED OUT THE COURSE THAT WOULD SECURE HIS OWN SAFETY WITH THE FEWEST UNPLEASANT CONCOMITANTS IT IS AGREEABLE TO KEEP A WHOLE SKIN BUT THE SKIN STILL REMAINS AN ORGAN SENSITIVE TO THE ATMOSPHERE
5604-26982-0009 HIS RECKONING HAD NOT DECEIVED HIM THAT NIGHT BEFORE HE RETURNED HOME HE HAD SECURED THE THREE RESULTS FOR WHICH HE MOST CARED
5604-26982-0010 HE WAS TO RETAIN HIS SECRETARYSHIP FOR ANOTHER YEAR UNLESS HE PREVIOUSLY RESIGNED IT AND LASTLY THE PRICE BY WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED THESE GUARANTEES WAS TO BE KEPT AS A STATE SECRET
5604-26982-0011 BUT ONE OF THE SPECIAL COUNCIL APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EVIDENCE OF THE PLOT FRANCESCO VALORI AS WE HAVE SEEN WAS THE HEAD OF THE PIAGNONI A MAN WITH CERTAIN FINE QUALITIES THAT WERE NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH VIOLENT PARTISANSHIP
5604-26982-0012 WITH AN ARROGANT TEMPER THAT ALIENATED HIS FRIENDS NOR WITH BITTER PERSONAL ANIMOSITIES ONE OF THE BITTEREST BEING DIRECTED AGAINST BERNARDO DEL NERO TO HIM IN A BRIEF PRIVATE INTERVIEW AFTER OBTAINING A PLEDGE OF SECRECY
5604-26982-0013 AN AGENCY INDUCED BY MOTIVES ABOUT WHICH HE WAS VERY FRANK DECLARING AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THEIR EFFORTS FUTILE AND THAT HE SINCERELY PREFERRED THE MAINTENANCE OF THE POPULAR GOVERNMENT AFFECTED TO CONFIDE TO VALORI AS A SECRET HIS OWN PERSONAL DISLIKE FOR BERNARDO DEL NERO
5604-26982-0014 BY A JOURNEY TO SIENA AND INTO ROMAGNA WHERE PIERO DE MEDICI WAS AGAIN TRYING TO GATHER FORCES OBTAIN DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE TO LAY BEFORE THE COUNCIL
5604-26982-0015 AND HENCE THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN A SOURCE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUTHORITIES MUST BE WRAPPED IN PROFOUND SECRECY STILL SOME ODOUR OF THE FACTS MIGHT ESCAPE IN SPITE OF PRECAUTION AND BEFORE TITO COULD INCUR THE UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES OF ACTING AGAINST HIS FRIENDS
5604-26982-0016 VALORI'S MIND WAS NOT INTENSELY BENT ON THE ESTIMATION OF TITO'S CONDUCT AND IT WAS INTENSELY BENT ON PROCURING AN EXTREME SENTENCE AGAINST THE FIVE PRISONERS THERE WERE SURE TO BE IMMENSE EFFORTS TO SAVE THEM
5604-26982-0017 AND IT WAS TO BE WISHED ON PUBLIC GROUNDS THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM SHOULD BE OF THE STRONGEST SO AS TO ALARM ALL WELL AFFECTED MEN AT THE DANGERS OF CLEMENCY
5604-26982-0018 AND IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO SEE THE NEXT UNLESS A TRAITOR TURNED UP LAMBERTO DELL ANTELLA HAD BEEN TORTURED IN AID OF HIS PREVIOUS WILLINGNESS TO TELL MORE THAN HE KNEW NEVERTHELESS ADDITIONAL AND STRONGER FACTS WERE DESIRABLE
5604-26982-0019 ESPECIALLY AGAINST BERNARDO DEL NERO WHO SO FAR AS APPEARED HITHERTO HAD SIMPLY REFRAINED FROM BETRAYING THE LATE PLOT AFTER HAVING TRIED IN VAIN TO DISCOURAGE IT FOR THE WELFARE OF FLORENCE DEMANDED THAT THE GUILT OF BERNARDO DEL NERO SHOULD BE PUT IN THE STRONGEST LIGHT
5604-26982-0020 SO FRANCESCO VALORI ZEALOUSLY BELIEVED AND PERHAPS HE WAS NOT HIMSELF AWARE THAT THE STRENGTH OF HIS ZEAL WAS DETERMINED BY HIS HATRED
5604-26982-0021 AND WON THEM OVER TO HIS OPINION LATE IN THE DAY TITO WAS ADMITTED TO AN AUDIENCE OF THE SPECIAL COUNCIL
5604-26982-0022 WHICH WAS TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED INTO EXECUTION IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS VERY MONTH OF AUGUST DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE ON THIS SUBJECT WOULD DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO MAKE THE RIGHT COURSE CLEAR HE RECEIVED A COMMISSION TO START FOR SIENA BY BREAK OF DAY AND BESIDES THIS
5604-26982-0023 AND WITH THAT APPARENTLY UNAFFECTED ADMISSION OF BEING ACTUATED BY MOTIVES SHORT OF THE HIGHEST WHICH IS OFTEN THE INTENSEST AFFECTATION THERE WERE SEVERAL WHOSE MINDS WERE NOT TOO ENTIRELY PREOCCUPIED TO PASS A NEW JUDGMENT ON HIM IN THESE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES
5604-26982-0024 THEY SILENTLY CONCLUDED THAT THIS INGENIOUS AND SERVICEABLE GREEK WAS IN FUTURE RATHER TO BE USED FOR PUBLIC NEEDS THAN FOR PRIVATE INTIMACY UNPRINCIPLED MEN WERE USEFUL
5604-26982-0025 ENABLING THOSE WHO HAD MORE SCRUPLES TO KEEP THEIR HANDS TOLERABLY CLEAN IN A WORLD WHERE THERE WAS MUCH DIRTY WORK TO BE DONE
5604-26982-0026 WITHOUT HUMAN INSTRUMENTS WHOM IT WOULD NOT BE UNBECOMING TO KICK OR TO SPIT UPON IN THE ACT OF HANDING THEM THEIR WAGES
5604-26982-0027 SOME OF THESE VERY MEN WHO PASSED A TACIT JUDGMENT ON TITO WERE SHORTLY TO BE ENGAGED IN A MEMORABLE TRANSACTION THAT COULD BY NO MEANS HAVE BEEN CARRIED THROUGH WITHOUT THE USE OF AN UNSCRUPULOUSNESS AS DECIDED AS HIS BUT AS THEIR OWN BRIGHT POET PULCI HAD SAID FOR THEM
5604-26982-0028 IT IS ONE THING TO LOVE THE FRUITS OF TREACHERY
5604-26982-0029 THE SAME SOCIETY HAS HAD A GIBBET FOR THE MURDERER AND A GIBBET FOR THE MARTYR AN EXECRATING HISS FOR A DASTARDLY ACT AND AS LOUD A HISS FOR MANY A WORD OF GENEROUS TRUTHFULNESS OR JUST INSIGHT A MIXED CONDITION OF THINGS WHICH IS THE SIGN NOT OF HOPELESS CONFUSION
5604-26982-0030 HE HAD THAT DEGREE OF SELF CONTEMPLATION WHICH NECESSARILY ACCOMPANIES THE HABIT OF ACTING ON WELL CONSIDERED REASONS OF WHATEVER QUALITY AND IF HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN HE WOULD HAVE DECLINED TO SEE HIMSELF DISAPPROVED BY MEN OF THE WORLD HE HAD NEVER MEANT TO BE DISAPPROVED
5604-26982-0031 HE HAD MEANT ALWAYS TO CONDUCT HIMSELF SO ABLY THAT IF HE ACTED IN OPPOSITION TO THE STANDARD OF OTHER MEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE AWARE OF IT AND THE BARRIER BETWEEN HIMSELF AND ROMOLA HAD BEEN RAISED BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH CONCEALMENT WITH HER
5604-26982-0032 HE SHRANK FROM CONDEMNATORY JUDGMENTS AS FROM A CLIMATE TO WHICH HE COULD NOT ADAPT HIMSELF BUT THINGS WERE NOT SO PLASTIC IN THE HANDS OF CLEVERNESS AS COULD BE WISHED AND EVENTS HAD TURNED OUT INCONVENIENTLY HE HAD REALLY NO RANCOUR AGAINST MESSER BERNARDO DEL NERO
5604-26982-0033 HE HAD SERVED THEM VERY ABLY AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT IF THEIR PARTY HAD BEEN WINNERS HE WOULD HAVE MERITED HIGH REWARD BUT WAS HE TO RELINQUISH ALL THE AGREEABLE FRUITS OF LIFE BECAUSE THEIR PARTY HAD FAILED HIS PROFFER OF A LITTLE ADDITIONAL PROOF AGAINST THEM WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON THEIR FATE
5604-26982-0034 IN FACT HE FELT CONVINCED THEY WOULD ESCAPE ANY EXTREME CONSEQUENCES BUT IF HE HAD NOT GIVEN IT HIS OWN FORTUNES WHICH MADE A PROMISING FABRIC WOULD HAVE BEEN UTTERLY RUINED AND WHAT MOTIVE COULD ANY MAN REALLY HAVE EXCEPT HIS OWN INTEREST
5604-26982-0035 FLORENTINES WHOSE PASSIONS WERE ENGAGED IN THEIR PETTY AND PRECARIOUS POLITICAL SCHEMES MIGHT HAVE NO SELF INTEREST SEPARABLE FROM FAMILY PRIDE AND TENACITY IN OLD HATREDS AND ATTACHMENTS A MODERN SIMPLETON WHO SWALLOWED WHOLE ONE OF THE OLD SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY
5604-26982-0036 OR THE VOICE OF AN INWARD MONITOR MIGHT SEE HIS INTEREST IN A FORM OF SELF CONCEIT WHICH HE CALLED SELF REWARDING VIRTUE FANATICS WHO BELIEVED IN THE COMING SCOURGE AND RENOVATION MIGHT SEE THEIR OWN INTEREST IN A FUTURE PALM BRANCH AND WHITE ROBE
5604-26982-0037 BUT NO MAN OF CLEAR INTELLECT ALLOWED HIS COURSE TO BE DETERMINED BY SUCH PUERILE IMPULSES OR QUESTIONABLE INWARD FUMES DID NOT PONTANUS POET AND PHILOSOPHER OF UNRIVALLED LATINITY
5604-26982-0038 MAKE THE FINEST POSSIBLE ORATION AT NAPLES TO WELCOME THE FRENCH KING WHO HAD COME TO DETHRONE THE LEARNED ORATOR'S ROYAL FRIEND AND PATRON AND STILL PONTANUS HELD UP HIS HEAD AND PROSPERED MEN DID NOT REALLY CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS EXCEPT WHEN THEIR PERSONAL SPLEEN WAS TOUCHED
5604-26982-0039 IT WAS WEAKNESS ONLY THAT WAS DESPISED POWER OF ANY SORT CARRIED ITS IMMUNITY AND NO MAN UNLESS BY VERY RARE GOOD FORTUNE COULD MOUNT HIGH IN THE WORLD WITHOUT INCURRING A FEW UNPLEASANT NECESSITIES WHICH LAID HIM OPEN TO ENMITY
5604-26982-0040 AND PERHAPS TO A LITTLE HISSING WHEN ENMITY WANTED A PRETEXT IT WAS A FAINT PROGNOSTIC OF THAT HISSING GATHERED BY TITO FROM CERTAIN INDICATIONS WHEN HE WAS BEFORE THE COUNCIL WHICH GAVE HIS PRESENT CONDUCT THE CHARACTER OF AN EPOCH TO HIM AND MADE HIM DWELL ON IT WITH ARGUMENTATIVE VINDICATION
5604-26982-0041 WELL A LITTLE PATIENCE AND IN ANOTHER YEAR OR PERHAPS IN HALF A YEAR HE MIGHT TURN HIS BACK ON THESE HARD EAGER FLORENTINES WITH THEIR FUTILE QUARRELS AND SINKING FORTUNES HIS BRILLIANT SUCCESS AT FLORENCE HAD HAD SOME UGLY FLAWS IN IT HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE WRONG WOMAN
5604-26982-0042 HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WELL TRIED SKILL COULD HE NOT STRIP HIMSELF OF THE PAST AS OF REHEARSAL CLOTHING AND THROW AWAY THE OLD BUNDLE TO ROBE HIMSELF FOR THE REAL SCENE IT DID NOT ENTER INTO TITO'S MEDITATIONS ON THE FUTURE THAT ON ISSUING FROM THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND DESCENDING THE STAIRS
