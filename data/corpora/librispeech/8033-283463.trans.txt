8033-283463-0000 A MATERIALIZED SPIRIT THAT WILL NOT GO BACK THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF WHAT MAY YET CAUSE VERY EXTENSIVE TROUBLE IN THIS WORLD THE SUN SATURDAY DECEMBER NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
8033-283463-0001 WE ARE PERMITTED TO MAKE EXTRACTS FROM A PRIVATE LETTER WHICH BEARS THE SIGNATURE OF A GENTLEMAN WELL KNOWN IN BUSINESS CIRCLES AND WHOSE VERACITY WE HAVE NEVER HEARD CALLED IN QUESTION HIS STATEMENTS ARE STARTLING AND WELL NIGH INCREDIBLE BUT IF TRUE
8033-283463-0002 THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EASY VERIFICATION YET THE THOUGHTFUL MIND WILL HESITATE ABOUT ACCEPTING THEM WITHOUT THE FULLEST PROOF FOR THEY SPRING UPON THE WORLD A SOCIAL PROBLEM OF STUPENDOUS IMPORTANCE
8033-283463-0003 THE DANGERS APPREHENDED BY MISTER MALTHUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS BECOME REMOTE AND COMMONPLACE BY THE SIDE OF THIS NEW AND TERRIBLE ISSUE THE LETTER IS DATED AT POCOCK ISLAND A SMALL TOWNSHIP IN WASHINGTON COUNTY MAINE
8033-283463-0004 ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILES FROM THE MAINLAND AND NEARLY MIDWAY BETWEEN MT DESERT AND THE GRAND MENAN THE LAST STATE CENSUS ACCORDS TO POCOCK ISLAND A POPULATION OF THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN
8033-283463-0005 MOSTLY ENGAGED IN THE PORGY FISHERIES AT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THE ISLAND GAVE GRANT A MAJORITY OF THREE THESE TWO FACTS ARE ALL THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LEARN OF THE LOCALITY
8033-283463-0006 FROM SOURCES OUTSIDE OF THE LETTER ALREADY REFERRED TO THE LETTER OMITTING CERTAIN PASSAGES WHICH REFER SOLELY TO PRIVATE MATTERS READS AS FOLLOWS BUT ENOUGH OF THE DISAGREEABLE BUSINESS
8033-283463-0007 THAT BROUGHT ME HERE TO THIS BLEAK ISLAND IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER I HAVE A SINGULAR STORY TO TELL YOU AFTER OUR EXPERIENCE TOGETHER AT CHITTENDEN I KNOW YOU WILL NOT REJECT STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE STARTLING MY FRIEND
8033-283463-0008 THERE IS UPON POCOCK ISLAND A MATERIALIZED SPIRIT WHICH
8033-283463-0009 AT THIS MOMENT AND WITHIN A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM ME AS I WRITE A MAN WHO DIED AND WAS BURIED FOUR YEARS AGO AND WHO HAS EXPLOITED THE MYSTERIES BEYOND THE GRAVE WALKS TALKS AND HOLDS INTERVIEWS
8033-283463-0010 IN APRIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY JOHN NEWBEGIN DIED AND WAS BURIED IN THE LITTLE CEMETERY ON THE LANDWARD SIDE OF THE ISLAND NEWBEGIN WAS A MAN OF ABOUT FORTY EIGHT WITHOUT FAMILY OR NEAR CONNECTIONS AND ECCENTRIC TO A DEGREE
8033-283463-0011 THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS NEWBEGIN WAS NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN KIND OF CULTURE
8033-283463-0012 AND AS A SIMPLE MINDED ISLANDER EXPRESSED IT IN MY HEARING KNEW MORE BOOKFULS THAN ANYBODY ON THE ISLAND HE WAS NATURALLY AN INTELLIGENT MAN
8033-283463-0013 DURING EASTERN CRUISES WILL REMEMBER A LONG LISTLESS FIGURE ASTONISHINGLY ATTIRED IN BLUE ARMY PANTS RUBBER BOOTS LOOSE TOGA MADE OF SOME BRIGHT CHINTZ MATERIAL AND VERY BAD HAT STAGGERING THROUGH
8033-283463-0014 BY THE TAIL THIS WAS JOHN NEWBEGIN HIS SUDDEN DEATH AS I HAVE ALREADY REMARKED HE DIED FOUR YEARS AGO LAST APRIL
8033-283463-0015 WHERE HE LIVED CLOSE DOWN TO THE SEAWEED AND ALMOST WITHIN REACH OF THE INCOMING TIDE THEY FOUND HIM DEAD ON THE FLOOR WITH AN EMPTIED DEMIJOHN HARD BY HIS HEAD
8033-283463-0016 AND IN THE EXCITEMENT OF A LARGE CATCH OF PORGIES THAT SUMMER SOON FORGOT HIM AND HIS FRIENDLESS LIFE HIS INTEREST IN THE MARY EMMELINE
8033-283463-0017 RECURRED TO JOHN HODGESON AND AS NOBODY CAME FORWARD TO DEMAND AN ADMINISTRATION OF THE ESTATE IT WAS NEVER ADMINISTERED THE FORMS OF LAW ARE BUT LOOSELY FOLLOWED IN SOME OF THESE MARGINAL LOCALITIES HIS REAPPEARANCE AT POCOCK
8033-283463-0018 WELL MY DEAR FOUR YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS HAD BROUGHT THEIR QUOTA OF VARYING SEASONS TO POCOCK ISLAND WHEN JOHN NEWBEGIN REAPPEARED UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES
8033-283463-0019 AS YOU MAY REMEMBER THERE WAS A HEAVY GALE ALL ALONG OUR ATLANTIC COAST DURING THIS STORM THE SQUADRON OF THE NAUGATUCK YACHT CLUB WHICH WAS RETURNING FROM A SUMMER CRUISE AS FAR AS CAMPOBELLO WAS FORCED TO TAKE SHELTER IN THE HARBOR TO THE LEEWARD
8033-283463-0020 OF POCOCK ISLAND THE GENTLEMEN OF THE CLUB SPENT THREE DAYS AT THE LITTLE SETTLEMENT ASHORE AMONG THE PARTY WAS MISTER R E BY WHICH NAME YOU WILL RECOGNIZE A MEDIUM OF CELEBRITY
8033-283463-0021 OF AN INDIAN CHIEF WHO ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AS HOCK A MOCK AND WHO RETIRED AFTER DANCING A HARVEST MOON PAS SEUL AND DECLARING HIMSELF IN VERY EMPHATIC TERMS AS OPPOSED TO THE PRESENT INDIAN POLICY OF THE ADMINISTRATION
8033-283463-0022 HOCK A MOCK WAS SUCCEEDED BY THE AUNT OF ONE OF THE YACHTSMEN WHO IDENTIFIED HERSELF BEYOND QUESTION BY ALLUSION TO FAMILY MATTERS AND BY DISPLAYING THE SCAR OF A BURN UPON HER LEFT ARM RECEIVED WHILE MAKING TOMATO CATSUP UPON EARTH
8033-283463-0023 REENTERED THE CABINET AND WERE SEEN NO MORE IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE ANOTHER SPIRIT MANIFESTED ITSELF AND MISTER E GAVE DIRECTIONS THAT THE LIGHTS BE TURNED DOWN STILL FURTHER THEN THE DOOR OF THE WOOD CLOSET WAS SLOWLY OPENED AND A SINGULAR FIGURE
8033-283463-0024 IN RUBBER BOOTS AND A SPECIES OF DOLLY VARDEN GARMENT EMERGED BRINGING A DEAD FISH IN HIS RIGHT HAND HIS DETERMINATION TO REMAIN
8033-283463-0025 IT IS JOHN NEWBEGIN AND THEN IN NOT UNNATURAL TERROR OF THE APPARITION THEY TURNED AND FLED FROM THE SCHOOLROOM UTTERING DISMAL CRIES JOHN NEWBEGIN CAME CALMLY FORWARD
8033-283463-0026 IN THE TEACHER'S CHAIR FOLDED HIS ARMS AND LOOKED COMPLACENTLY ABOUT HIM YOU MIGHT AS WELL UNTIE THE MEDIUM HE FINALLY REMARKED I PROPOSE TO REMAIN IN THE MATERIALIZED CONDITION AND HE DID REMAIN
8033-283463-0027 WHEN THE PARTY LEFT THE SCHOOLHOUSE AMONG THEM WALKED JOHN NEWBEGIN
8033-283463-0028 FROM THAT DAY TO THIS HE HAS BEEN A LIVING INHABITANT OF POCOCK ISLAND EATING DRINKING WATER ONLY AND SLEEPING AFTER THE MANNER OF MEN THE YACHTSMEN WHO MADE SAIL FOR BAR HARBOR THE VERY NEXT MORNING PROBABLY BELIEVE
8033-283463-0029 THAT HE WAS A FRAUD HIRED FOR THE OCCASION BY MISTER E BUT THE PEOPLE OF POCOCK WHO LAID HIM OUT DUG HIS GRAVE AND PUT HIM INTO IT FOUR YEARS AGO KNOW THAT JOHN NEWBEGIN HAS COME BACK TO THEM FROM A LAND THEY KNOW NOT OF
8033-283463-0030 A SINGULAR MEMBER OF SOCIETY THE IDEA OF HAVING A GHOST SOMEWHAT MORE CONDENSED IT IS TRUE THAN THE TRADITIONAL GHOST AS A MEMBER WAS NOT AT FIRST OVERPLEASING TO THE THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN INHABITANTS OF POCOCK ISLAND
8033-283463-0031 THIS RELUCTANCE TO ADVERTISE THE SKELETON IN THEIR CLOSET SUPERADDED TO THE SLOWNESS OF THESE OBTUSE FISHY MATTER OF FACT PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE THE TRANSCENDENT IMPORTANCE OF THE CASE MUST BE ACCEPTED
8033-283463-0032 BUT THE POCOCKIANS HAVE AT LAST COME TO SEE THAT A SPIRIT IS NOT NECESSARILY A MALEVOLENT SPIRIT AND ACCEPTING HIS PRESENCE
8033-283463-0033 UNREASONING WAY THEY ARE QUITE NEIGHBORLY AND SOCIABLE WITH MISTER NEWBEGIN I KNOW THAT YOUR FIRST QUESTION WILL BE IS THERE SUFFICIENT PROOF OF HIS EVER HAVING BEEN DEAD TO THIS I ANSWER UNHESITATINGLY YES
8033-283463-0034 HE WAS TOO WELL KNOWN A CHARACTER AND TOO MANY PEOPLE SAW THE CORPSE TO ADMIT OF ANY MISTAKE ON THIS POINT I MAY ADD HERE THAT IT WAS AT ONE TIME PROPOSED TO DISINTER THE ORIGINAL REMAINS BUT THAT PROJECT WAS ABANDONED IN DEFERENCE TO THE WISHES OF MISTER NEWBEGIN
8033-283463-0035 WHO FEELS A NATURAL DELICACY ABOUT HAVING HIS FIRST SET OF BONES DISTURBED FROM MOTIVES OF MERE CURIOSITY AN INTERVIEW WITH A DEAD MAN YOU WILL READILY BELIEVE THAT I TOOK OCCASION TO SEE AND CONVERSE WITH JOHN NEWBEGIN
8033-283463-0036 I FOUND HIM AFFABLE AND EVEN COMMUNICATIVE HE IS PERFECTLY AWARE OF HIS DOUBTFUL STATUS AS A BEING
8033-283463-0037 IT IS TO BE PRESUMED THAT THE MEMORY IS NOT A PLEASANT ONE AT LEAST HE NEVER SPEAKS OF THIS PERIOD HE CANDIDLY ADMITS HOWEVER THAT HE IS GLAD TO GET BACK TO EARTH
8033-283463-0038 THAT THIS REGRET IS GENUINE HE HAS DISCARDED HIS ECCENTRIC COSTUME AND DRESSES LIKE A REASONABLE SPIRIT HE HAS NOT TOUCHED LIQUOR SINCE HIS REAPPEARANCE
8033-283463-0039 BY THE WAY NEWBEGIN THREATENS TO SUE HODGESON FOR HIS INDIVIDED QUARTER IN EACH OF THESE VESSELS AND THIS INTERESTING CASE THEREFORE BIDS FAIR TO BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED IN THE COURTS
8033-283463-0040 AS A BUSINESS MAN HE IS GENERALLY ESTEEMED ON THE ISLAND ALTHOUGH THERE IS A NOTICEABLE RELUCTANCE TO DISCOUNT HIS PAPER AT LONG DATES
8033-283463-0041 AND HAS ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF RUNNING FOR THE NEXT LEGISLATURE IN CONCLUSION AND NOW MY DEAR I HAVE TOLD YOU THE SUBSTANCE OF ALL I KNOW RESPECTING THIS STRANGE STRANGE CASE YET AFTER ALL WHY SO STRANGE
8033-283463-0042 WE ACCEPTED MATERIALIZATION AT CHITTENDEN IS THIS ANY MORE THAN THE LOGICAL ISSUE OF THAT ADMISSION IF THE SPIRIT MAY RETURN TO EARTH CLOTHED IN FLESH AND BLOOD AND ALL THE PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES OF HUMANITY WHY MAY IT NOT REMAIN ON EARTH
8033-283463-0043 AS LONG AS IT SEES FIT THINKING OF IT FROM WHATEVER STANDPOINT I CANNOT BUT REGARD JOHN NEWBEGIN AS THE PIONEER OF A POSSIBLY LARGE IMMIGRATION FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD THE BARS ONCE DOWN A WHOLE FLOCK WILL COME TROOPING BACK TO EARTH
8033-283463-0044 DEATH WILL LOSE ITS SIGNIFICANCE ALTOGETHER AND WHEN I THINK OF THE DISTURBANCE WHICH WILL RESULT IN OUR SOCIAL RELATIONS OF THE OVERTHROW OF ALL ACCEPTED INSTITUTIONS AND OF THE NULLIFICATION OF ALL PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY LAW AND RELIGION
