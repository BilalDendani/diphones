2060-150855-0000 MEANWHILE HE WAS A HUSBAND PERHAPS HIS UNION SHOULD HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZED BEFORE THE CROWN OF LIFE HAD BEEN ATTAINED THE VAGUE YEARNINGS THE MISREAD IMPULSES HAD FOUND ACCOMPLISHMENT AT LAST
2060-150855-0001 BUT AS THE TERM PASSED HE KNEW THAT BEHIND THE YEARNING THERE REMAINED A YEARNING BEHIND THE DRAWN VEIL A VEIL THAT HE COULD NOT DRAW HIS WEDDING HAD BEEN NO MIGHTY LANDMARK HE WOULD OFTEN WONDER WHETHER SUCH AND SUCH A SPEECH OR INCIDENT CAME AFTER IT OR BEFORE
2060-150855-0002 SINCE THAT MEETING IN THE SOHO RESTAURANT THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH TO DO CLOTHES TO BUY PRESENTS TO THANK FOR A BRIEF VISIT TO A TRAINING COLLEGE A HONEYMOON AS BRIEF IN SUCH A BUSTLE WHAT SPIRITUAL UNION COULD TAKE PLACE
2060-150855-0003 SURELY THE DUST WOULD SETTLE SOON IN ITALY AT EASTER HE MIGHT PERCEIVE THE INFINITIES OF LOVE BUT LOVE HAD SHOWN HIM ITS INFINITIES ALREADY NEITHER BY MARRIAGE NOR BY ANY OTHER DEVICE CAN MEN INSURE THEMSELVES A VISION
2060-150855-0004 AND RICKIE'S HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM THREE YEARS BEFORE WHEN HE HAD SEEN HIS WIFE AND A DEAD MAN CLASPED IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS SHE WAS NEVER TO BE SO REAL TO HIM AGAIN SHE RAN ABOUT THE HOUSE LOOKING HANDSOMER THAN EVER
2060-150855-0005 BUT TODAY ONE SAID IT IS LIKE THE COUNTRY ARM IN ARM THEY STROLLED IN THE SIDE GARDEN STOPPING AT TIMES TO NOTICE THE CROCUSES OR TO WONDER WHEN THE DAFFODILS WOULD FLOWER SUDDENLY HE TIGHTENED HIS PRESSURE AND SAID DARLING
2060-150855-0006 WHY DON'T YOU STILL WEAR EAR RINGS EAR RINGS SHE LAUGHED MY TASTE HAS IMPROVED PERHAPS SO AFTER ALL THEY NEVER MENTIONED GERALD'S NAME BUT HE HOPED IT WAS STILL DEAR TO HER HE DID NOT WANT HER TO FORGET THE GREATEST MOMENT IN HER LIFE
2060-150855-0007 HIS LOVE DESIRED NOT OWNERSHIP BUT CONFIDENCE AND TO A LOVE SO PURE IT DOES NOT SEEM TERRIBLE TO COME SECOND HE VALUED EMOTION NOT FOR ITSELF BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY FINAL PATH TO INTIMACY
2060-150855-0008 SHE EVER ROBUST AND PRACTICAL ALWAYS DISCOURAGED HIM SHE WAS NOT COLD SHE WOULD WILLINGLY EMBRACE HIM BUT SHE HATED BEING UPSET AND WOULD LAUGH OR THRUST HIM OFF WHEN HIS VOICE GREW SERIOUS IN THIS SHE REMINDED HIM OF HIS MOTHER
2060-150855-0009 DID SHE BLESS HIS UNION SO DIFFERENT TO HER OWN DID SHE LOVE HIS WIFE HE TRIED TO SPEAK OF HER TO AGNES BUT AGAIN SHE WAS RELUCTANT AND PERHAPS IT WAS THIS AVERSION TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEAD
2060-150855-0010 A RIFLE CORPS WAS TO BE FORMED SHE HOPED THAT THE BOYS WOULD HAVE PROPER UNIFORMS INSTEAD OF SHOOTING IN THEIR OLD CLOTHES AS MISTER JACKSON HAD SUGGESTED THERE WAS TEWSON COULD NOTHING BE DONE ABOUT HIM HE WOULD SLINK AWAY FROM THE OTHER PREFECTS AND GO WITH BOYS OF HIS OWN AGE
2060-150855-0011 THERE WAS LLOYD HE WOULD NOT LEARN THE SCHOOL ANTHEM SAYING THAT IT HURT HIS THROAT AND ABOVE ALL THERE WAS VARDEN WHO TO RICKIE'S BEWILDERMENT WAS NOW A MEMBER OF DUNWOOD HOUSE HE HAD TO GO SOMEWHERE SAID AGNES LUCKY FOR HIS MOTHER THAT WE HAD A VACANCY
2060-150855-0012 SHE HAD TAKEN THE BOY OUT OF CHARITY AND WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT IN HAD COME THIS OFFICIOUS LIMPET AND UPSET THE HEADMASTER AND SHE WAS SCOLDED
2060-150855-0013 AND MISSUS VARDEN WAS SCOLDED AND MISTER JACKSON WAS SCOLDED AND THE BOY WAS SCOLDED AND PLACED WITH MISTER PEMBROKE WHOM SHE REVERED LESS THAN ANY MAN IN THE WORLD NATURALLY ENOUGH SHE CONSIDERED IT A FURTHER ATTEMPT OF THE AUTHORITIES TO SNUB THE DAY BOYS
2060-150855-0014 FOR WHOSE ADVANTAGE THE SCHOOL HAD BEEN FOUNDED SHE AND MISSUS JACKSON DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT AT THEIR TEA PARTIES AND THE LATTER LADY WAS SURE THAT NO GOOD NO GOOD OF ANY KIND WOULD COME TO DUNWOOD HOUSE FROM SUCH ILL GOTTEN PLUNDER
2060-150855-0015 WE SAY LET THEM TALK PERSISTED RICKIE BUT I NEVER DID LIKE LETTING PEOPLE TALK WE ARE RIGHT AND THEY ARE WRONG BUT I WISH THE THING COULD HAVE BEEN DONE MORE QUIETLY THE HEADMASTER DOES GET SO EXCITED HE HAS GIVEN A GANG OF FOOLISH PEOPLE THEIR OPPORTUNITY
2060-150855-0016 I DON'T LIKE BEING BRANDED AS THE DAY BOY'S FOE WHEN I THINK HOW MUCH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN TO BE A DAY BOY MYSELF MY FATHER FOUND ME A NUISANCE AND PUT ME THROUGH THE MILL AND I CAN NEVER FORGET IT PARTICULARLY THE EVENINGS
2060-150855-0017 THERE'S VERY LITTLE BULLYING HERE SAID AGNES THERE WAS VERY LITTLE BULLYING AT MY SCHOOL THERE WAS SIMPLY THE ATMOSPHERE OF UNKINDNESS WHICH NO DISCIPLINE CAN DISPEL IT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE DO TO YOU BUT WHAT THEY MEAN THAT HURTS I DON'T UNDERSTAND
2060-150855-0018 IF A MAN HITS YOU BY ACCIDENT OR PLAY BUT JUST A LITTLE TAP WHEN YOU KNOW IT COMES FROM HATRED IS TOO TERRIBLE BOYS DO HATE EACH OTHER I REMEMBER IT AND SEE IT AGAIN
2060-150855-0019 ALL I KNOW IS THERE'S VERY LITTLE BULLYING HERE YOU SEE THE NOTION OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP DEVELOPS LATE YOU CAN JUST SEE ITS BEGINNING HERE AMONG THE PREFECTS UP AT CAMBRIDGE IT FLOURISHES AMAZINGLY THAT'S WHY I PITY PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO UP TO CAMBRIDGE
2060-150855-0020 NOT BECAUSE A UNIVERSITY IS SMART BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE MAGIC YEARS AND WITH LUCK YOU SEE UP THERE WHAT YOU COULDN'T SEE BEFORE AND MAYN'T EVER SEE AGAIN AREN'T THESE THE MAGIC YEARS THE LADY DEMANDED HE LAUGHED AND HIT AT HER
2060-150855-0021 I'M GETTING SOMEWHAT INVOLVED BUT HEAR ME O AGNES FOR I AM PRACTICAL
2060-150855-0022 LONG MAY THEY FLOURISH BUT I DO NOT APPROVE OF THE BOARDING HOUSE SYSTEM IT ISN'T AN INEVITABLE ADJUNCT
2060-150855-0023 SILENCE MADAM DON'T BETRAY ME TO HERBERT OR I'LL GIVE US THE SACK BUT SERIOUSLY WHAT IS THE GOOD OF THROWING BOYS SO MUCH TOGETHER ISN'T IT BUILDING THEIR LIVES ON A WRONG BASIS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER I WISH THEY DID BUT THEY DON'T
2060-150855-0024 THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE SIMPLY MARVELLOUS WHEN THEY DO THE WHOLE OF LIFE CHANGES AND YOU GET THE TRUE THING BUT DON'T PRETEND YOU'VE GOT IT BEFORE YOU HAVE
2060-150855-0025 PATRIOTISM AND ESPRIT DE CORPS ARE ALL VERY WELL BUT MASTERS A LITTLE FORGET THAT THEY MUST GROW FROM SENTIMENT THEY CANNOT CREATE ONE CANNOT CANNOT CANNOT I NEVER CARED A STRAW FOR ENGLAND UNTIL I CARED FOR ENGLISHMEN
2060-150855-0026 AND BOYS CAN'T LOVE THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY HATE EACH OTHER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I WILL NOW CONCLUDE MY ADDRESS AND MOST OF IT IS COPIED OUT OF MISTER ANSELL THE TRUTH IS HE WAS SUDDENLY ASHAMED
2060-150855-0027 CAMBRIDGE AND ALL THAT IT MEANT HAD STOOD BEFORE HIM PASSIONATELY CLEAR AND BESIDE IT STOOD HIS MOTHER AND THE SWEET FAMILY LIFE WHICH NURSES UP A BOY UNTIL HE CAN SALUTE HIS EQUALS HE WAS ASHAMED FOR HE REMEMBERED HIS NEW RESOLUTION
2060-150855-0028 TO WORK WITHOUT CRITICIZING TO THROW HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY INTO THE MACHINE NOT TO MIND IF HE WAS PINCHED NOW AND THEN BY THE ELABORATE WHEELS MISTER ANSELL CRIED HIS WIFE LAUGHING SOMEWHAT SHRILLY AHA NOW I UNDERSTAND
2060-150855-0029 IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING POOR MISTER ANSELL WOULD SAY WELL I'M BRUTAL I BELIEVE IT DOES VARDEN GOOD TO HAVE HIS EARS PULLED NOW AND THEN AND I DON'T CARE WHETHER THEY PULL THEM IN PLAY OR NOT BOYS OUGHT TO ROUGH IT OR THEY NEVER GROW UP INTO MEN AND YOUR MOTHER WOULD HAVE AGREED WITH ME
2060-150855-0030 OH YES AND YOU'RE ALL WRONG ABOUT PATRIOTISM IT CAN CAN CREATE A SENTIMENT SHE WAS UNUSUALLY PRECISE AND HAD FOLLOWED HIS THOUGHTS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT WAS ALSO UNUSUAL HE WONDERED WHETHER SHE WAS NOT RIGHT AND REGRETTED THAT SHE PROCEEDED TO SAY
2060-150855-0031 FOR RICKIE SUFFERED FROM THE PRIMAL CURSE WHICH IS NOT AS THE AUTHORIZED VERSION SUGGESTS THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL BUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL THEN STICK TO THE DUNWOOD HOUSE SET I DO AND SHALL
2060-150855-0032 AGAIN HE WAS ASHAMED WHY WOULD HE SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS HE REBUKED HIS SOUL NOT UNSUCCESSFULLY AND THEN THEY RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF VARDEN I'M CERTAIN HE SUFFERS SAID HE FOR SHE WOULD DO NOTHING BUT LAUGH
2060-150855-0033 EACH BOY WHO PASSES PULLS HIS EARS VERY FUNNY NO DOUBT BUT EVERY DAY THEY STICK OUT MORE AND GET REDDER AND THIS AFTERNOON WHEN HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS BEING WATCHED HE WAS HOLDING HIS HEAD AND MOANING I HATE THE LOOK ABOUT HIS EYES I HATE THE WHOLE BOY
2060-150855-0034 NASTY WEEDY THING WELL I'M A NASTY WEEDY THING IF IT COMES TO THAT NO YOU AREN'T SHE CRIED KISSING HIM BUT HE LED HER BACK TO THE SUBJECT COULD NOTHING BE SUGGESTED
2060-150855-0035 HE DREW UP SOME NEW RULES ALTERATIONS IN THE TIMES OF GOING TO BED AND SO ON THE EFFECT OF WHICH WOULD BE TO PROVIDE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PULLING OF VARDEN'S EARS THE RULES WERE SUBMITTED TO HERBERT WHO SYMPATHIZED WITH WEAKLINESS MORE THAN DID HIS SISTER
