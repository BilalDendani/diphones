1421-8522-0000 LADY RUSSELL WAS MOST ANXIOUSLY ZEALOUS ON THE SUBJECT AND GAVE IT MUCH SERIOUS CONSIDERATION SHE WAS A WOMAN RATHER OF SOUND THAN OF QUICK ABILITIES WHOSE DIFFICULTIES IN COMING TO ANY DECISION IN THIS INSTANCE WERE GREAT
1421-8522-0001 FROM THE OPPOSITION OF TWO LEADING PRINCIPLES SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS
1421-8522-0002 AS ARISTOCRATIC IN HER IDEAS OF WHAT WAS DUE TO THEM AS ANYBODY OF SENSE AND HONESTY COULD WELL BE SHE WAS A BENEVOLENT CHARITABLE GOOD WOMAN AND CAPABLE OF STRONG ATTACHMENTS MOST CORRECT IN HER CONDUCT
1421-8522-0003 SHE HAD A CULTIVATED MIND AND WAS GENERALLY SPEAKING RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT BUT SHE HAD PREJUDICES ON THE SIDE OF ANCESTRY SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM
1421-8522-0004 HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER INDEPENDENT OF HIS CLAIMS AS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AN ATTENTIVE NEIGHBOUR AN OBLIGING LANDLORD THE HUSBAND OF HER VERY DEAR FRIEND THE FATHER OF ANNE AND HER SISTERS
1421-8522-0005 WAS AS BEING SIR WALTER IN HER APPREHENSION ENTITLED TO A GREAT DEAL OF COMPASSION AND CONSIDERATION UNDER HIS PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THEY MUST RETRENCH THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT BUT SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND ELIZABETH
1421-8522-0006 SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE WHO NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST IN THE QUESTION
1421-8522-0007 WHICH WAS AT LAST SUBMITTED TO SIR WALTER EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE
1421-8522-0008 FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS SAID LADY RUSSELL LOOKING OVER HER PAPER MUCH MAY BE DONE IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE REGULATIONS IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR
1421-8522-0009 AND I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM AND ELIZABETH THAT KELLYNCH HALL HAS A RESPECTABILITY IN ITSELF WHICH CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY THESE REDUCTIONS AND THAT THE TRUE DIGNITY OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT
1421-8522-0010 BY ACTING LIKE A MAN OF PRINCIPLE WHAT WILL HE BE DOING IN FACT BUT WHAT VERY MANY OF OUR FIRST FAMILIES HAVE DONE OR OUGHT TO DO THERE WILL BE NOTHING SINGULAR IN HIS CASE AND IT IS SINGULARITY WHICH OFTEN MAKES THE WORST PART OF OUR SUFFERING
1421-8522-0011 I HAVE GREAT HOPE OF PREVAILING WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED FOR AFTER ALL
1421-8522-0012 AND THOUGH A GREAT DEAL IS DUE TO THE FEELINGS OF THE GENTLEMAN AND THE HEAD OF A HOUSE LIKE YOUR FATHER THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN THIS WAS THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH ANNE WANTED HER FATHER TO BE PROCEEDING HIS FRIENDS TO BE URGING HIM
1421-8522-0013 SHE CONSIDERED IT AS AN ACT OF INDISPENSABLE DUTY TO CLEAR AWAY THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS WITH ALL THE EXPEDITION WHICH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RETRENCHMENTS COULD SECURE AND SAW NO DIGNITY IN ANYTHING SHORT OF IT SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED AND FELT AS A DUTY
1421-8522-0014 SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION
1421-8522-0015 HER KNOWLEDGE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH INCLINED HER TO THINK THAT THE SACRIFICE OF ONE PAIR OF HORSES WOULD BE HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN OF BOTH AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS
1421-8522-0016 HOW ANNE'S MORE RIGID REQUISITIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE LADY RUSSELL'S HAD NO SUCCESS AT ALL COULD NOT BE PUT UP WITH WERE NOT TO BE BORNE WHAT EVERY COMFORT OF LIFE KNOCKED OFF JOURNEYS LONDON SERVANTS HORSES TABLE
1421-8522-0017 TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN NO HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS QUIT KELLYNCH HALL
1421-8522-0018 WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING
1421-8522-0019 HE HAD NO SCRUPLE HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING IN A HOUSE WHICH HAD SUCH A CHARACTER OF HOSPITALITY AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT
1421-8522-0020 IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION
1421-8522-0021 THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES LONDON BATH OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY ALL ANNE'S WISHES HAD BEEN FOR THE LATTER A SMALL HOUSE IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
1421-8522-0022 WHERE THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE LADY RUSSELL'S SOCIETY STILL BE NEAR MARY AND STILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES SEEING THE LAWNS AND GROVES OF KELLYNCH WAS THE OBJECT OF HER AMBITION BUT THE USUAL FATE OF ANNE ATTENDED HER IN HAVING SOMETHING VERY OPPOSITE FROM HER INCLINATION FIXED ON
1421-8522-0023 SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON BUT MISTER SHEPHERD FELT THAT HE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED IN LONDON AND HAD BEEN SKILFUL ENOUGH TO DISSUADE HIM FROM IT AND MAKE BATH PREFERRED
1421-8522-0024 HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT ITS MORE CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM KELLYNCH ONLY FIFTY MILES AND LADY RUSSELL'S SPENDING SOME PART OF EVERY WINTER THERE
1421-8522-0025 AND TO THE VERY GREAT SATISFACTION OF LADY RUSSELL WHOSE FIRST VIEWS ON THE PROJECTED CHANGE HAD BEEN FOR BATH SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE
1421-8522-0026 LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT SIR WALTER TO DESCEND INTO A SMALL HOUSE IN HIS OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD ANNE HERSELF WOULD HAVE FOUND THE MORTIFICATIONS OF IT MORE THAN SHE FORESAW
1421-8522-0027 AND TO SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFUL AND WITH REGARD TO ANNE'S DISLIKE OF BATH SHE CONSIDERED IT AS A PREJUDICE AND MISTAKE ARISING FIRST FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER HAVING BEEN THREE YEARS AT SCHOOL THERE AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH AND SECONDLY
1421-8522-0028 FROM HER HAPPENING TO BE NOT IN PERFECTLY GOOD SPIRITS THE ONLY WINTER WHICH SHE HAD AFTERWARDS SPENT THERE WITH HERSELF LADY RUSSELL WAS FOND OF BATH IN SHORT AND DISPOSED TO THINK IT MUST SUIT THEM ALL
1421-8522-0029 AND AS TO HER YOUNG FRIEND'S HEALTH BY PASSING ALL THE WARM MONTHS WITH HER AT KELLYNCH LODGE EVERY DANGER WOULD BE AVOIDED AND IT WAS IN FACT A CHANGE WHICH MUST DO BOTH HEALTH AND SPIRITS GOOD ANNE HAD BEEN TOO LITTLE FROM HOME TOO LITTLE SEEN
1421-8522-0030 HER SPIRITS WERE NOT HIGH A LARGER SOCIETY WOULD IMPROVE THEM SHE WANTED HER TO BE MORE KNOWN THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART AND A VERY MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME
1421-8522-0031 WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME BUT TO SEE IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET THIS HOWEVER
1421-8522-0032 WAS A PROFOUND SECRET NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN CIRCLE SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE MISTER SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD ADVERTISE BUT NEVER DARED APPROACH IT AGAIN
1421-8522-0033 SIR WALTER SPURNED THE IDEA OF ITS BEING OFFERED IN ANY MANNER FORBAD THE SLIGHTEST HINT BEING DROPPED OF HIS HAVING SUCH AN INTENTION AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE SUPPOSITION OF HIS BEING SPONTANEOUSLY SOLICITED BY SOME MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE APPLICANT ON HIS OWN TERMS
1421-8522-0034 AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE LADY RUSSELL HAD ANOTHER EXCELLENT ONE AT HAND FOR BEING EXTREMELY GLAD THAT SIR WALTER AND HIS FAMILY WERE TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY
1421-8522-0035 ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
1421-8522-0036 SHE WAS A CLEVER YOUNG WOMAN WHO UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF PLEASING THE ART OF PLEASING AT LEAST AT KELLYNCH HALL AND WHO HAD MADE HERSELF SO ACCEPTABLE TO MISS ELLIOT
1421-8522-0037 WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE LADY RUSSELL INDEED HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT
1421-8522-0038 SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST IN TRYING TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON
1421-8522-0039 SENSIBLY OPEN TO ALL THE INJUSTICE AND ALL THE DISCREDIT OF THE SELFISH ARRANGEMENTS WHICH SHUT HER OUT AND ON MANY LESSER OCCASIONS HAD ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE ELIZABETH THE ADVANTAGE OF HER OWN BETTER JUDGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE BUT ALWAYS IN VAIN ELIZABETH WOULD GO HER OWN WAY
1421-8522-0040 AND NEVER HAD SHE PURSUED IT IN MORE DECIDED OPPOSITION TO LADY RUSSELL THAN IN THIS SELECTION OF MISSUS CLAY TURNING FROM THE SOCIETY OF SO DESERVING A SISTER TO BESTOW HER AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE ON ONE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY
