7828-105179-0000 TARZAN AND OTOBU WERE BOTH EQUALLY CONFIDENT THAT THE XUJANS WOULD NOT FOLLOW THEM BEYOND THE GORGE BUT THOUGH THEY SCANNED EVERY INCH OF THE FROWNING CLIFFS UPON EITHER HAND NOON CAME
7828-105179-0001 AND THERE WAS STILL NO INDICATION OF ANY AVENUE OF ESCAPE TO RIGHT OR LEFT THERE WERE PLACES WHERE THE APE MAN ALONE MIGHT HAVE NEGOTIATED THE ASCENT BUT NONE WHERE THE OTHERS COULD HOPE SUCCESSFULLY TO REACH THE PLATEAU NOR WHERE TARZAN POWERFUL AND AGILE AS HE WAS
7828-105179-0002 AND HOW GREATLY THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS AND THE FATIGUE OF THE PAST WEEKS MUST HAVE TOLD UPON HER VITALITY HE SAW HOW BRAVELY SHE ATTEMPTED TO KEEP UP YET HOW OFTEN SHE STUMBLED AND STAGGERED AS SHE LABORED THROUGH THE SAND AND GRAVEL OF THE GORGE NOR COULD HE HELP BUT ADMIRE HER FORTITUDE
7828-105179-0003 AND THE UNCOMPLAINING EFFORT SHE WAS MAKING TO PUSH ON THE ENGLISHMAN MUST HAVE NOTICED HER CONDITION TOO FOR SOME TIME AFTER NOON HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND SAT DOWN IN THE SAND IT'S NO USE HE SAID TO TARZAN I CAN GO NO FARTHER
7828-105179-0004 YOU WILL HAVE TO GO ON WITHOUT ME NO SAID THE GIRL WE CANNOT DO THAT WE HAVE ALL BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH TOGETHER AND THE CHANCES OF OUR ESCAPE ARE STILL SO REMOTE THAT WHATEVER COMES LET US REMAIN TOGETHER UNLESS
7828-105179-0005 AND SHE LOOKED UP AT TARZAN YOU WHO HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR US TO WHOM YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATIONS WILL GO ON WITHOUT US
7828-105179-0006 AND THE NEAREST FERTILE COUNTRY THE APE MAN RETURNED HER SERIOUS LOOK WITH A SMILE YOU ARE NOT DEAD HE SAID TO HER NOR IS THE LIEUTENANT NOR OTOBU NOR MYSELF ONE IS EITHER DEAD
7828-105179-0007 WHICH IS THE NEAREST SPOT AT WHICH WE MAY EXPECT TO FIND GAME AND WATER BUT WE SHALL NOT GIVE UP ON THAT ACCOUNT SO FAR WE HAVE FOUND A WAY LET US TAKE THINGS AS THEY COME LET US REST NOW BECAUSE YOU AND LIEUTENANT SMITH OLDWICK NEED THE REST AND WHEN YOU ARE STRONGER
7828-105179-0008 WE WILL GO ON AGAIN BUT THE XUJANS SHE ASKED MAY THEY NOT FOLLOW US HERE YES HE SAID THEY PROBABLY WILL BUT WE NEED NOT BE CONCERNED WITH THEM UNTIL THEY COME I WISH SAID THE GIRL THAT I POSSESSED YOUR PHILOSOPHY
7828-105179-0009 YOU WERE NOT BORN AND REARED IN THE JUNGLE BY WILD BEASTS AND AMONG WILD BEASTS OR YOU WOULD POSSESS AS I DO THE FATALISM OF THE JUNGLE AND SO THEY MOVED TO THE SIDE OF THE GORGE BENEATH THE SHADE OF AN OVERHANGING ROCK
7828-105179-0010 AND LAY DOWN IN THE HOT SAND TO REST NUMA WANDERED RESTLESSLY TO AND FRO AND FINALLY AFTER SPRAWLING FOR A MOMENT CLOSE BESIDE THE APE MAN ROSE AND MOVED OFF UP THE GORGE TO BE LOST TO VIEW A MOMENT LATER BEYOND THE NEAREST TURN
7828-105179-0011 FOR AN HOUR THE LITTLE PARTY RESTED AND THEN TARZAN SUDDENLY ROSE AND MOTIONING THE OTHERS TO SILENCE LISTENED FOR A MINUTE HE STOOD MOTIONLESS HIS KEEN EARS ACUTELY RECEPTIVE TO SOUNDS SO FAINT AND DISTANT
7828-105179-0012 THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THREE COULD DETECT THE SLIGHTEST BREAK IN THE UTTER AND DEATHLIKE QUIET OF THE GORGE FINALLY THE APE MAN RELAXED AND TURNED TOWARD THEM WHAT IS IT ASKED THE GIRL THEY ARE COMING HE REPLIED
7828-105179-0013 THEY ARE YET SOME DISTANCE AWAY THOUGH NOT FAR FOR THE SANDALED FEET OF THE MEN AND THE PADS OF THE LIONS MAKE LITTLE NOISE UPON THE SOFT SANDS WHAT SHALL WE DO TRY TO GO ON ASKED SMITH OLDWICK I BELIEVE I COULD MAKE A GO OF IT NOW FOR A SHORT WAY
7828-105179-0014 I AM MUCH RESTED HOW ABOUT YOU MISS KIRCHER OH YES SHE SAID I AM MUCH STRONGER YES SURELY I CAN GO ON TARZAN KNEW THAT NEITHER OF THEM QUITE SPOKE THE TRUTH
7828-105179-0015 THAT PEOPLE DO NOT RECOVER SO QUICKLY FROM UTTER EXHAUSTION BUT HE SAW NO OTHER WAY AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE HOPE THAT JUST BEYOND THE NEXT TURN WOULD BE A WAY OUT OF THE GORGE YOU HELP THE LIEUTENANT OTOBU HE SAID TURNING TO THE BLACK
7828-105179-0016 AND THOUGH THE GIRL OBJECTED SAYING THAT HE MUST NOT WASTE HIS STRENGTH HE LIFTED HER LIGHTLY IN HIS ARMS AND MOVED OFF UP THE CANYON FOLLOWED BY OTOBU AND THE ENGLISHMAN THEY HAD GONE NO GREAT DISTANCE WHEN THE OTHERS OF THE PARTY BECAME AWARE OF THE SOUNDS OF PURSUIT
7828-105179-0017 FOR NOW THE LIONS WERE WHINING AS THOUGH THE FRESH SCENT SPOOR OF THEIR QUARRY HAD REACHED THEIR NOSTRILS I WISH THAT YOUR NUMA WOULD RETURN SAID THE GIRL YES SAID TARZAN BUT WE SHALL HAVE TO DO THE BEST WE CAN WITHOUT HIM
7828-105179-0018 I SHOULD LIKE TO FIND SOME PLACE WHERE WE CAN BARRICADE OURSELVES AGAINST ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES POSSIBLY THEN WE MIGHT HOLD THEM OFF SMITH OLDWICK IS A GOOD SHOT
7828-105179-0019 PROVIDED THEY CAN ONLY COME AT HIM ONE AT A TIME THE LIONS DON'T BOTHER ME SO MUCH SOMETIMES THEY ARE STUPID ANIMALS AND I AM SURE THAT THESE THAT PURSUE US AND WHO ARE SO DEPENDENT UPON THE MASTERS THAT HAVE RAISED AND TRAINED THEM
7828-105179-0020 WILL BE EASILY HANDLED AFTER THE WARRIORS ARE DISPOSED OF YOU THINK THERE IS SOME HOPE THEN SHE ASKED WE ARE STILL ALIVE WAS HIS ONLY ANSWER THERE HE SAID PRESENTLY I THOUGHT I RECALLED THIS VERY SPOT
7828-105179-0021 HE POINTED TOWARD A FRAGMENT THAT HAD EVIDENTLY FALLEN FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF AND WHICH NOW LAY IMBEDDED IN THE SAND A FEW FEET FROM THE BASE IT WAS A JAGGED FRAGMENT OF ROCK
7828-105179-0022 LEAVING A NARROW APERTURE BETWEEN IT AND THE CLIFF BEHIND TOWARD THIS THEY DIRECTED THEIR STEPS AND WHEN FINALLY THEY REACHED THEIR GOAL THEY FOUND A SPACE ABOUT TWO FEET WIDE AND TEN FEET LONG BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE CLIFF TO BE SURE IT WAS OPEN AT BOTH ENDS
7828-105179-0023 BUT AT LEAST THEY COULD NOT BE ATTACKED UPON ALL SIDES AT ONCE THEY HAD SCARCELY CONCEALED THEMSELVES BEFORE TARZAN'S QUICK EARS CAUGHT A SOUND UPON THE FACE OF THE CLIFF ABOVE THEM AND LOOKING UP HE SAW A DIMINUTIVE MONKEY PERCHED UPON A SLIGHT PROJECTION
7828-105179-0024 AN UGLY FACED LITTLE MONKEY WHO LOOKED DOWN UPON THEM FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCAMPERED AWAY TOWARD THE SOUTH IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THEIR PURSUERS WERE COMING OTOBU HAD SEEN THE MONKEY TOO HE WILL TELL THE PARROTS SAID THE BLACK AND THE PARROTS WILL TELL THE MADMEN
7828-105179-0025 AND THEN AT LAST AND ALMOST WITH RELIEF SHE KNEW THAT THE PURSUERS WERE UPON THEM SHE HEARD THE ANGRY ROARING OF THE LIONS AND THE CRIES OF THE MADMEN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES THE MEN SEEMED TO BE INVESTIGATING THE STRONGHOLD WHICH THEIR QUARRY HAD DISCOVERED SHE COULD HEAR THEM BOTH
7828-105179-0026 TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH AND THEN FROM WHERE SHE LAY SHE SAW A LION CHARGING FOR THE APE MAN BEFORE HER SHE SAW THE GIANT ARM SWING BACK WITH THE CURVED SABER AND SHE SAW IT FALL WITH TERRIFIC VELOCITY AND MEET THE LION AS HE ROSE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE MAN
7828-105179-0027 THEN SHE HEARD FOOTSTEPS RUNNING RAPIDLY TOWARD SMITH OLDWICK AND AS HIS PISTOL SPOKE THERE WAS A SCREAM AND THE SOUND OF A FALLING BODY EVIDENTLY DISHEARTENED BY THE FAILURE OF THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT THE ASSAULTERS DREW OFF BUT ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME
7828-105179-0028 WHICH WAS NOT SUBDUED UNTIL BOTH HE AND SMITH OLDWICK HAD BEEN MAULED AND THE LATTER HAD SUCCEEDED IN RUNNING THE POINT OF THE SABER THE GIRL HAD CARRIED INTO THE BEAST'S HEART THE MAN WHO OPPOSED TARZAN
7828-105179-0029 ONCE AGAIN THE ENEMY WITHDREW BUT AGAIN ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME AND NOW THEY CAME IN FULL FORCE THE LIONS AND THE MEN
7828-105179-0030 THE MEN CASTING THEIR SPEARS AND THE LIONS WAITING JUST BEHIND EVIDENTLY FOR THE SIGNAL TO CHARGE IS THIS THE END ASKED THE GIRL
7828-105179-0031 IN ATTEMPTING TO SHIELD THE GIRL TARZAN RECEIVED ONE OF THE SHAFTS IN THE SHOULDER AND SO HEAVILY HAD THE WEAPON BEEN HURLED THAT IT BORE HIM BACKWARD TO THE GROUND SMITH OLDWICK FIRED HIS PISTOL TWICE WHEN HE TOO WAS STRUCK DOWN
7828-105179-0032 THE WEAPON ENTERING HIS RIGHT LEG MIDWAY BETWEEN HIP AND KNEE ONLY OTOBU REMAINED TO FACE THE ENEMY FOR THE ENGLISHMAN ALREADY WEAK FROM HIS WOUNDS
7828-105179-0033 ONE OF THE WARRIORS LEAPED FULL UPON HIS BREAST AND BORE HIM BACK AS WITH FIENDISH SHRIEKS HE RAISED THE POINT OF HIS SABER ABOVE THE OTHER'S HEART BEFORE HE COULD DRIVE IT HOME THE GIRL LEVELED SMITH OLDWICK'S PISTOL AND FIRED POINT BLANK AT THE FIEND'S FACE
7828-105179-0034 SIMULTANEOUSLY THERE BROKE UPON THE ASTONISHED EARS OF BOTH ATTACKERS AND ATTACKED A VOLLEY OF SHOTS FROM THE GORGE WITH THE SWEETNESS OF THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN THE EUROPEANS HEARD THE SHARP BARKED COMMANDS OF AN ENGLISH NONCOM
7828-105179-0035 TARZAN STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET THE SPEAR STILL PROTRUDING FROM HIS SHOULDER THE GIRL ROSE TOO AND AS TARZAN WRENCHED THE WEAPON FROM HIS FLESH AND STEPPED OUT FROM BEHIND THE CONCEALMENT OF THEIR REFUGE SHE FOLLOWED AT HIS SIDE
7828-105179-0036 SEEING THE FELLOW'S ACTIONS AND REALIZING INSTANTLY THE NATURAL ERROR THAT TARZAN'S YELLOW TUNIC HAD OCCASIONED THE GIRL SPRANG BETWEEN HIM AND THE SOLDIER DON'T SHOOT SHE CRIED TO THE LATTER WE ARE BOTH FRIENDS HOLD UP YOUR HANDS YOU THEN
7828-105179-0037 HE COMMANDED TARZAN I AIN'T TAKING NO CHANCES WITH ANY DUFFER WITH A YELLOW SHIRT AT THIS JUNCTURE THE BRITISH SERGEANT WHO HAD BEEN IN COMMAND OF THE ADVANCE GUARD APPROACHED AND WHEN TARZAN AND THE GIRL SPOKE TO HIM IN ENGLISH EXPLAINING THEIR DISGUISES HE ACCEPTED THEIR WORD
7828-105179-0038 SINCE THEY WERE EVIDENTLY NOT OF THE SAME RACE AS THE CREATURES WHICH LAY DEAD ABOUT THEM
7828-105179-0039 SMITH OLDWICK'S WOUNDS WERE DRESSED AS WELL AS WERE THOSE OF THE APE MAN AND IN HALF AN HOUR THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE CAMP OF THEIR RESCUERS
7828-105179-0040 AS DID OTOBU'S AND THAT THEY WOULD TRAVEL TOGETHER AS FAR AS THE COUNTRY OF THE WAMABOS YOU ARE NOT GOING BACK WITH US THEN ASKED THE GIRL NO REPLIED THE APE MAN
7828-105179-0041 I WILL CONTINUE MY JOURNEY IN THAT DIRECTION SHE CAST APPEALING EYES TOWARD HIM YOU WILL GO BACK INTO THAT TERRIBLE JUNGLE SHE ASKED WE SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN HE LOOKED AT HER A MOMENT IN SILENCE
7828-105179-0042 NEVER HE SAID AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD TURNED AND WALKED AWAY
7828-105179-0043 TARZAN WAS STANDING SOME DISTANCE AWAY AS THE SHIP LANDED AND THE OFFICER DESCENDED TO THE GROUND HE SAW THE COLONEL GREET HIS JUNIOR IN COMMAND OF THE ADVANCE DETACHMENT AND THEN HE SAW HIM TURN TOWARD BERTHA KIRCHER
7828-105179-0044 TARZAN WONDERED HOW THE GERMAN SPY FELT IN THIS SITUATION ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE MUST KNOW THAT THERE WAS ONE THERE WHO KNEW HER REAL STATUS HE SAW COLONEL CAPELL WALK TOWARD HER
7828-105179-0045 ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT HEAR THE WORDS OF HIS GREETING HE SAW THAT IT WAS FRIENDLY AND CORDIAL TO A DEGREE TARZAN TURNED AWAY SCOWLING AND IF ANY HAD BEEN CLOSE BY THEY MIGHT HAVE HEARD A LOW GROWL RUMBLE FROM HIS CHEST HE KNEW THAT HIS COUNTRY WAS AT WAR WITH GERMANY
7828-105179-0046 AND THAT NOT ONLY HIS DUTY TO THE LAND OF HIS FATHERS BUT ALSO HIS PERSONAL GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE ENEMY PEOPLE AND HIS HATRED OF THEM DEMANDED THAT HE EXPOSE THE GIRL'S PERFIDY AND YET HE HESITATED AND BECAUSE HE HESITATED HE GROWLED
7828-105179-0047 THE TOMMIES THEIR PACKS AND ACCOUTERMENTS SLUNG WERE WAITING THE SUMMONS TO CONTINUE THEIR RETURN MARCH COLONEL CAPELL HAD THROUGH A DESIRE TO PERSONALLY OBSERVE THE STRETCH OF COUNTRY BETWEEN THE CAMP OF THE ADVANCE DETACHMENT AND THE BASE
7828-105179-0048 WERE ONLY PROMPTED BY A SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN CONSIDERING MY WELFARE
7828-105179-0049 IS THAT ALL YOU KNEW ASKED CAPELL THAT IS ALL SAID THE APE MAN
7828-105179-0050 ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH INTELLIGENCE SERVICE ATTACHED TO THE EAST AFRICAN FORCES HER FATHER AND I SERVED IN INDIA TOGETHER AND I HAVE KNOWN HER EVER SINCE SHE WAS BORN
7828-105179-0051 SINGLE MINDED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DUTY LOOK
7828-105179-0052 BUT AS YOU SEE HERE IS A MILITARY SKETCH MAP
7828-105179-0053 THE DIARY OF HAUPTMANN FRITZ SCHNEIDER REPEATED TARZAN IN A CONSTRAINED VOICE MAY I SEE IT CAPELL HE IS THE MAN WHO MURDERED LADY GREYSTOKE THE ENGLISHMAN HANDED THE LITTLE VOLUME OVER TO THE OTHER WITHOUT A WORD
7828-105179-0054 AND WHEN HE FOUND IT HE READ RAPIDLY SUDDENLY A GASP OF INCREDULITY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
7828-105179-0055 GOD EXCLAIMED THE APE MAN CAN THIS BE TRUE LISTEN AND HE READ AN EXCERPT FROM THE CLOSELY WRITTEN PAGE PLAYED A LITTLE JOKE ON THE ENGLISH PIG WHEN HE COMES HOME HE WILL FIND THE BURNED BODY OF HIS WIFE IN HER BOUDOIR
7828-105179-0056 BUT HE WILL ONLY THINK IT IS HIS WIFE HAD VON GOSS SUBSTITUTE THE BODY OF A DEAD NEGRESS AND CHAR IT AFTER PUTTING LADY GREYSTOKE'S RINGS ON IT LADY G WILL BE OF MORE VALUE TO THE HIGH COMMAND ALIVE THAN DEAD SHE LIVES CRIED TARZAN
7828-105179-0057 BUT HOW COULD I KNOW I EVEN TOLD SMITH OLDWICK WHO LOVES HER THAT SHE WAS A GERMAN SPY NOT ONLY MUST I RETURN TO FIND MY WIFE BUT I MUST RIGHT THIS WRONG DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT SAID CAPELL SHE MUST HAVE CONVINCED HIM THAT SHE IS NO ENEMY SPY
