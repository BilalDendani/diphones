47-122796-0000 THOSE WHO DO NOT LIKE HIM MAGNIFY IT SHRUG UP THEIR SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIM THERE HE IS AGAIN
47-122796-0001 ROME HAS ITS CORSO NAPLES ITS TOLEDO AH THAT ANDERSEN THERE HE IS AGAIN THEY WOULD CRY YET I MUST TO PLEASE MY FANCY CONTINUE QUITE QUIETLY AND ADD
47-122796-0002 A VERY LARGE PARTY IN ORDER AS IS OFTEN THE CASE TO GET A RETURN INVITATION FROM THE OTHERS
47-122796-0003 NOW LET US SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO AMUSE OURSELVES THEY HAD GOT JUST SO FAR AND THE CONVERSATION BEGAN TO CRYSTALLISE AS IT COULD BUT DO WITH THE SCANTY STREAM WHICH THE COMMONPLACE WORLD SUPPLIED AMONGST OTHER THINGS THEY SPOKE OF THE MIDDLE AGES
47-122796-0004 SOME PRAISED THAT PERIOD AS FAR MORE INTERESTING FAR MORE POETICAL THAN OUR OWN TOO SOBER PRESENT INDEED COUNCILLOR KNAP DEFENDED THIS OPINION SO WARMLY THAT THE HOSTESS DECLARED IMMEDIATELY ON HIS SIDE AND BOTH EXERTED THEMSELVES WITH UNWEARIED ELOQUENCE
47-122796-0005 WE WILL JUST STEP OUT INTO THE ANTECHAMBER WHERE CLOAKS MACKINTOSHES STICKS UMBRELLAS AND SHOES WERE DEPOSITED HERE SAT TWO FEMALE FIGURES A YOUNG AND AN OLD ONE ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT AT FIRST THEY WERE SERVANTS COME TO ACCOMPANY THEIR MISTRESSES HOME
47-122796-0006 BUT ON LOOKING NEARER ONE SOON SAW THEY COULD SCARCELY BE MERE SERVANTS
47-122796-0007 THE YOUNGER IT IS TRUE WAS NOT DAME FORTUNE HERSELF BUT ONE OF THE WAITING MAIDS OF HER HANDMAIDENS WHO CARRY ABOUT THE LESSER GOOD THINGS THAT SHE DISTRIBUTES THE OTHER LOOKED EXTREMELY GLOOMY IT WAS CARE SHE ALWAYS ATTENDS TO HER OWN SERIOUS BUSINESS HERSELF
47-122796-0008 AS THEN SHE IS SURE OF HAVING IT DONE PROPERLY THEY WERE TELLING EACH OTHER WITH A CONFIDENTIAL INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DURING THE DAY THE MESSENGER OF FORTUNE HAD ONLY EXECUTED A FEW UNIMPORTANT COMMISSIONS SUCH AS SAVING A NEW BONNET FROM A SHOWER OF RAIN ET CETERA
47-122796-0009 BUT WHAT SHE HAD YET TO PERFORM WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL I MUST TELL YOU SAID SHE
47-122796-0010 WHICH I AM TO CARRY TO MANKIND THESE SHOES POSSESS THE PROPERTY OF INSTANTLY TRANSPORTING HIM WHO HAS THEM ON TO THE PLACE OR THE PERIOD IN WHICH HE MOST WISHES TO BE EVERY WISH AS REGARDS TIME OR PLACE OR STATE OF BEING WILL BE IMMEDIATELY FULFILLED AND SO AT LAST MAN WILL BE HAPPY HERE BELOW
47-122796-0011 REPLIED CARE IN A SEVERE TONE OF REPROACH NO HE WILL BE VERY UNHAPPY AND WILL ASSUREDLY BLESS THE MOMENT WHEN HE FEELS THAT HE HAS FREED HIMSELF FROM THE FATAL SHOES STUPID NONSENSE SAID THE OTHER ANGRILY
47-122796-0012 SOME ONE WILL MAKE A MISTAKE FOR CERTAIN AND TAKE THE WRONG ONES HE WILL BE A HAPPY MAN SUCH WAS THEIR CONVERSATION TWO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUNCILLOR
47-122796-0013 IT WAS LATE COUNCILLOR KNAP DEEPLY OCCUPIED WITH THE TIMES OF KING HANS INTENDED TO GO HOME AND MALICIOUS FATE MANAGED MATTERS SO THAT HIS FEET INSTEAD OF FINDING THEIR WAY TO HIS OWN GALOSHES SLIPPED INTO THOSE OF FORTUNE
47-122796-0014 ON WHICH ACCOUNT HIS FOOT VERY NATURALLY SANK IN THE MUD AND PUDDLES OF THE STREET THERE HAVING BEEN IN THOSE DAYS NO PAVEMENT IN COPENHAGEN WELL THIS IS TOO BAD HOW DIRTY IT IS HERE SIGHED THE COUNCILLOR
47-122796-0015 AS TO A PAVEMENT I CAN FIND NO TRACES OF ONE AND ALL THE LAMPS IT SEEMS HAVE GONE TO SLEEP THE MOON WAS NOT YET VERY HIGH IT WAS BESIDES RATHER FOGGY SO THAT IN THE DARKNESS ALL OBJECTS SEEMED MINGLED IN CHAOTIC CONFUSION
47-122796-0016 THE WELL KNOWN GROUP OF THE VIRGIN AND THE INFANT JESUS
47-122796-0017 A FEW PERSONS IN THE COSTUME OF THE TIME OF KING HANS PASSED QUICKLY BY HIM HOW STRANGE THEY LOOK THE GOOD FOLKS COME PROBABLY FROM A MASQUERADE
47-122796-0018 THE COUNCILLOR STOOD STILL AND WATCHED A MOST STRANGE PROCESSION PASS BY FIRST CAME A DOZEN DRUMMERS WHO UNDERSTOOD PRETTY WELL HOW TO HANDLE THEIR INSTRUMENTS THEN CAME HALBERDIERS AND SOME ARMED WITH CROSS BOWS THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE PROCESSION WAS A PRIEST
47-122796-0019 ASTONISHED AT WHAT HE SAW THE COUNCILLOR ASKED WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MUMMERY AND WHO THAT MAN WAS THAT'S THE BISHOP OF ZEALAND WAS THE ANSWER GOOD HEAVENS WHAT HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE BISHOP SIGHED THE COUNCILLOR SHAKING HIS HEAD IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE THE BISHOP
47-122796-0020 EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONSIDERED THE MOST ABSENT MAN IN THE WHOLE KINGDOM AND PEOPLE TOLD THE DROLLEST ANECDOTES ABOUT HIM REFLECTING ON THE MATTER AND WITHOUT LOOKING RIGHT OR LEFT THE COUNCILLOR WENT THROUGH EAST STREET AND ACROSS THE HABRO PLATZ THE BRIDGE LEADING TO PALACE SQUARE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND
47-122796-0021 DOES YOUR HONOR WANT TO CROSS THE FERRY TO THE HOLME ASKED THEY ACROSS TO THE HOLME SAID THE COUNCILLOR WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE AT THAT MOMENT WAS NO I AM GOING TO CHRISTIANSHAFEN TO LITTLE MARKET STREET BOTH MEN STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
47-122796-0022 ONLY JUST TELL ME WHERE THE BRIDGE IS SAID HE IT IS REALLY UNPARDONABLE THAT THERE ARE NO LAMPS HERE AND IT IS AS DIRTY AS IF ONE HAD TO WADE THROUGH A MORASS THE LONGER HE SPOKE WITH THE BOATMEN THE MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE DID THEIR LANGUAGE BECOME TO HIM
47-122796-0023 I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR BORNHOLMISH DIALECT SAID HE AT LAST ANGRILY AND TURNING HIS BACK UPON THEM HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE BRIDGE THERE WAS NO RAILWAY EITHER IT IS REALLY DISGRACEFUL WHAT A STATE THIS PLACE IS IN MUTTERED HE TO HIMSELF
47-122796-0024 NEVER HAD HIS AGE WITH WHICH HOWEVER HE WAS ALWAYS GRUMBLING SEEMED SO MISERABLE AS ON THIS EVENING I'LL TAKE A HACKNEY COACH THOUGHT HE BUT WHERE WERE THE HACKNEY COACHES NOT ONE WAS TO BE SEEN
47-122796-0025 HE FOUND HOWEVER A LITTLE SIDE DOOR OPEN AND THROUGH THIS HE WENT AND STEPPED INTO OUR NEW MARKET OF THE PRESENT TIME IT WAS A HUGE DESOLATE PLAIN SOME WILD BUSHES STOOD UP HERE AND THERE WHILE ACROSS THE FIELD FLOWED A BROAD CANAL OR RIVER
47-122796-0026 SOME WRETCHED HOVELS FOR THE DUTCH SAILORS RESEMBLING GREAT BOXES AND AFTER WHICH THE PLACE WAS NAMED LAY ABOUT IN CONFUSED DISORDER ON THE OPPOSITE BANK I EITHER BEHOLD A FATA MORGANA OR I AM REGULARLY TIPSY WHIMPERED OUT THE COUNCILLOR BUT WHAT'S THIS
47-122796-0027 HE TURNED ROUND ANEW FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS SERIOUSLY ILL HE GAZED AT THE STREET FORMERLY SO WELL KNOWN TO HIM AND NOW SO STRANGE IN APPEARANCE AND LOOKED AT THE HOUSES MORE ATTENTIVELY MOST OF THEM WERE OF WOOD SLIGHTLY PUT TOGETHER AND MANY HAD A THATCHED ROOF NO
47-122796-0028 I AM FAR FROM WELL SIGHED HE AND YET I DRANK ONLY ONE GLASS OF PUNCH BUT I CANNOT SUPPOSE IT IT WAS TOO REALLY VERY WRONG TO GIVE US PUNCH AND HOT SALMON FOR SUPPER
47-122796-0029 BUT NO THAT WOULD BE TOO SILLY AND HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS IF THEY ARE UP STILL HE LOOKED FOR THE HOUSE BUT IT HAD VANISHED IT IS REALLY DREADFUL GROANED HE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY I CANNOT RECOGNISE EAST STREET AGAIN
47-122796-0030 THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DECENT SHOP FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER NOTHING BUT WRETCHED HUTS CAN I SEE ANYWHERE JUST AS IF I WERE AT RINGSTEAD OH I AM ILL I CAN SCARCELY BEAR MYSELF ANY LONGER WHERE THE DEUCE CAN THE HOUSE BE
47-122796-0031 IT MUST BE HERE ON THIS VERY SPOT YET THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF RESEMBLANCE TO SUCH A DEGREE HAS EVERYTHING CHANGED THIS NIGHT AT ALL EVENTS HERE ARE SOME PEOPLE UP AND STIRRING OH OH I AM CERTAINLY VERY ILL HE NOW HIT UPON A HALF OPEN DOOR
47-122796-0032 WAS A SORT OF HOSTELRY OF THOSE TIMES A KIND OF PUBLIC HOUSE THE ROOM HAD SOME RESEMBLANCE TO THE CLAY FLOORED HALLS IN HOLSTEIN A PRETTY NUMEROUS COMPANY CONSISTING OF SEAMEN COPENHAGEN BURGHERS AND A FEW SCHOLARS SAT HERE IN DEEP CONVERSE OVER THEIR PEWTER CANS
47-122796-0033 AND GAVE LITTLE HEED TO THE PERSON WHO ENTERED BY YOUR LEAVE SAID THE COUNCILLOR TO THE HOSTESS WHO CAME BUSTLING TOWARDS HIM I'VE FELT SO QUEER ALL OF A SUDDEN WOULD YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SEND FOR A HACKNEY COACH TO TAKE ME TO CHRISTIANSHAFEN
47-122796-0034 THE WOMAN EXAMINED HIM WITH EYES OF ASTONISHMENT AND SHOOK HER HEAD SHE THEN ADDRESSED HIM IN GERMAN THE COUNCILLOR THOUGHT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND DANISH AND THEREFORE REPEATED HIS WISH IN GERMAN THIS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS COSTUME STRENGTHENED THE GOOD WOMAN IN THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER
47-122796-0035 THAT HE WAS ILL SHE COMPREHENDED DIRECTLY SO SHE BROUGHT HIM A PITCHER OF WATER WHICH TASTED CERTAINLY PRETTY STRONG OF THE SEA ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN FETCHED FROM THE WELL THE COUNCILLOR SUPPORTED HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND DREW A LONG BREATH AND THOUGHT OVER ALL THE WONDROUS THINGS HE SAW AROUND HIM
47-122796-0036 HE ASKED MECHANICALLY AS HE SAW THE HOSTESS PUSH ASIDE A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER THE MEANING OF THIS COUNCILLORSHIP QUERY REMAINED OF COURSE A RIDDLE TO HER YET SHE HANDED HIM THE PAPER WITHOUT REPLYING IT WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT REPRESENTING A SPLENDID METEOR
47-122796-0037 AS SEEN IN THE TOWN OF COLOGNE WHICH WAS TO BE READ BELOW IN BRIGHT LETTERS THAT IS VERY OLD SAID THE COUNCILLOR WHOM THIS PIECE OF ANTIQUITY BEGAN TO MAKE CONSIDERABLY MORE CHEERFUL PRAY HOW DID YOU COME INTO POSSESSION OF THIS RARE PRINT
47-122796-0038 IT IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE IS A MERE FABLE SUCH METEOROUS APPEARANCES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED IN THIS WAY THAT THEY ARE THE REFLECTIONS OF THE AURORA BOREALIS AND IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THEY ARE CAUSED PRINCIPALLY BY ELECTRICITY
47-122796-0039 THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE SITTING NEAREST HIM AND HEARD HIS SPEECH STARED AT HIM IN WONDERMENT AND ONE OF THEM ROSE TOOK OFF HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY AND SAID WITH A SERIOUS COUNTENANCE YOU ARE NO DOUBT A VERY LEARNED MAN MONSIEUR
47-122796-0040 AS INDEED ONE MUST DO ACCORDING TO THE DEMANDS OF THE WORLD AT PRESENT
47-122796-0041 I AM A BACHELOR IN THEOLOGIA ANSWERED THE GENTLEMAN WITH A STIFF REVERENCE THIS REPLY FULLY SATISFIED THE COUNCILLOR THE TITLE SUITED THE DRESS HE IS CERTAINLY THOUGHT HE SOME VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER SOME QUEER OLD FELLOW
47-122796-0042 TALES OF EVERY DAY LIFE SAID OUR BACHELOR INQUIRINGLY I MEAN THOSE NEW FANGLED NOVELS TWISTING AND WRITHING THEMSELVES IN THE DUST OF COMMONPLACE WHICH ALSO EXPECT TO FIND A READING PUBLIC OH EXCLAIMED THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN SMILING
47-122796-0043 THERE IS MUCH WIT IN THEM BESIDES THEY ARE READ AT COURT THE KING LIKES THE HISTORY OF SIR IFFVEN AND SIR GAUDIAN PARTICULARLY WHICH TREATS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE HE HAS MORE THAN ONCE JOKED ABOUT IT WITH HIS HIGH VASSALS I HAVE NOT READ THAT NOVEL SAID THE COUNCILLOR
47-122796-0044 IT MUST BE QUITE A NEW ONE THAT HEIBERG HAS PUBLISHED LATELY NO ANSWERED THE THEOLOGIAN OF THE TIME OF KING HANS THAT BOOK IS NOT WRITTEN BY A HEIBERG BUT WAS IMPRINTED BY GODFREY VON GEHMEN OH IS THAT THE AUTHOR'S NAME SAID THE COUNCILLOR
47-122796-0045 IT IS A VERY OLD NAME AND AS WELL AS I RECOLLECT HE WAS THE FIRST PRINTER THAT APPEARED IN DENMARK YES HE IS OUR FIRST PRINTER REPLIED THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN HASTILY SO FAR ALL WENT ON WELL
47-122796-0046 SOME ONE OF THE WORTHY BURGHERS NOW SPOKE OF THE DREADFUL PESTILENCE THAT HAD RAGED IN THE COUNTRY A FEW YEARS BACK
47-122796-0047 THE COUNCILLOR IMAGINED IT WAS THE CHOLERA THAT WAS MEANT WHICH PEOPLE MADE SO MUCH FUSS ABOUT AND THE DISCOURSE PASSED OFF SATISFACTORILY ENOUGH
47-122796-0048 THE ENGLISH PIRATES HAD THEY SAID MOST SHAMEFULLY TAKEN THEIR SHIPS WHILE IN THE ROADSTEAD AND THE COUNCILLOR BEFORE WHOSE EYES THE HEROSTRATIC EVENT OF EIGHTEEN O ONE STILL FLOATED VIVIDLY
47-122796-0049 THEY POURED OUT THE LIQUOR AND MADE THE MOST FRIENDLY GESTICULATIONS WHILE A COLD PERSPIRATION TRICKLED DOWN THE BACK OF THE POOR COUNCILLOR WHAT'S TO BE THE END OF THIS WHAT'S TO BECOME OF ME
47-122796-0050 THEY TOOK HOLD OF THE WORTHY MAN WHO HEARING ON EVERY SIDE THAT HE WAS INTOXICATED
47-122796-0051 THEY HOWEVER IMAGINED HE WAS TALKING RUSSIAN NEVER BEFORE HE THOUGHT HAD HE BEEN IN SUCH A COARSE AND IGNORANT COMPANY
47-122796-0052 IS THE MOST DREADFUL MOMENT OF MY LIFE THE WHOLE WORLD IS LEAGUED AGAINST ME
47-122796-0053 HE DID SO BUT JUST AS HE WAS GOING THE OTHERS REMARKED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT THEY LAID HOLD OF HIM BY THE LEGS AND NOW HAPPILY FOR HIM OFF FELL HIS FATAL SHOES AND WITH THEM THE CHARM WAS AT AN END
47-122796-0054 ALL SEEMED TO HIM IN PROPER ORDER AS USUAL IT WAS EAST STREET SPLENDID AND ELEGANT AS WE NOW SEE IT HE LAY WITH HIS FEET TOWARDS A DOORWAY AND EXACTLY OPPOSITE SAT THE WATCHMAN ASLEEP GRACIOUS HEAVEN SAID HE HAVE I LAIN HERE IN THE STREET AND DREAMED
47-122796-0055 YES TIS EAST STREET HOW SPLENDID AND LIGHT IT IS BUT REALLY IT IS TERRIBLE WHAT AN EFFECT THAT ONE GLASS OF PUNCH MUST HAVE HAD ON ME
47-122796-0056 HE THOUGHT OF THE DISTRESS AND AGONY HE HAD ENDURED AND PRAISED FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS HEART THE HAPPY REALITY OUR OWN TIME WHICH WITH ALL ITS DEFICIENCIES IS YET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT IN WHICH SO MUCH AGAINST HIS INCLINATION HE HAD LATELY BEEN THREE
47-122796-0057 THE WATCHMAN'S ADVENTURE WHY THERE IS A PAIR OF GALOSHES AS SURE AS I'M ALIVE SAID THE WATCHMAN AWAKING FROM A GENTLE SLUMBER THEY BELONG NO DOUBT TO THE LIEUTENANT WHO LIVES OVER THE WAY THEY LIE CLOSE TO THE DOOR
47-122796-0058 THE WORTHY MAN WAS INCLINED TO RING AND DELIVER THEM AT THE HOUSE FOR THERE WAS STILL A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW
47-122796-0059 SUCH A PAIR OF SHOES MUST BE VERY WARM AND COMFORTABLE SAID HE THE LEATHER IS SO SOFT AND SUPPLE THEY FITTED HIS FEET AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIM TIS A CURIOUS WORLD WE LIVE IN CONTINUED HE SOLILOQUIZING
47-122796-0060 WOULD TO HEAVEN I COULD BUT CHANGE WITH HIM HOW HAPPY SHOULD I BE WHILE EXPRESSING HIS WISH THE CHARM OF THE SHOES WHICH HE HAD PUT ON BEGAN TO WORK THE WATCHMAN ENTERED INTO THE BEING AND NATURE OF THE LIEUTENANT
47-122796-0061 HE STOOD IN THE HANDSOMELY FURNISHED APARTMENT AND HELD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS A SMALL SHEET OF ROSE COLORED PAPER ON WHICH SOME VERSES WERE WRITTEN WRITTEN INDEED BY THE OFFICER HIMSELF
47-122796-0062 AND IF ONE THEN MARKS DOWN ONE'S THOUGHTS POETRY IS PRODUCED
47-122796-0063 OH WERE I RICH OH WERE I RICH SUCH WAS MY WISH YEA SUCH WHEN HARDLY THREE FEET HIGH I LONGED FOR MUCH OH WERE I RICH AN OFFICER WERE I WITH SWORD AND UNIFORM AND PLUME SO HIGH
47-122796-0064 AND THE TIME CAME AND OFFICER WAS I BUT YET I GREW NOT RICH ALAS POOR ME HAVE PITY THOU WHO ALL MAN'S WANTS DOST SEE I SAT ONE EVENING SUNK IN DREAMS OF BLISS A MAID OF SEVEN YEARS OLD
47-122796-0065 GAVE ME A KISS I AT THAT TIME WAS RICH IN POESY AND TALES OF OLD THOUGH POOR AS POOR COULD BE BUT ALL SHE ASKED FOR WAS THIS POESY THEN WAS I RICH BUT NOT IN GOLD POOR ME
47-122796-0066 BUT I'M CONDEMNED TO SILENCE OH POOR ME AS THOU DOST KNOW WHO ALL MEN'S HEARTS CANST SEE OH WERE I RICH IN CALM AND PEACE OF MIND MY GRIEF YOU THEN WOULD NOT HERE WRITTEN FIND
47-122796-0067 O THOU TO WHOM I DO MY HEART DEVOTE OH READ THIS PAGE OF GLAD DAYS NOW REMOTE A DARK DARK TALE WHICH I TONIGHT DEVOTE DARK IS THE FUTURE NOW ALAS POOR ME HAVE PITY THOU WHO ALL MEN'S PAINS
47-122796-0068 DOST SEE SUCH VERSES AS THESE PEOPLE WRITE WHEN THEY ARE IN LOVE BUT NO MAN IN HIS SENSES EVER THINKS OF PRINTING THEM HERE ONE OF THE SORROWS OF LIFE IN WHICH THERE IS REAL POETRY GAVE ITSELF VENT NOT THAT BARREN GRIEF WHICH THE POET MAY ONLY HINT AT
47-122796-0069 BUT NEVER DEPICT IN ITS DETAIL MISERY AND WANT THAT ANIMAL NECESSITY IN SHORT TO SNATCH AT LEAST AT A FALLEN LEAF OF THE BREAD FRUIT TREE IF NOT AT THE FRUIT ITSELF THE HIGHER THE POSITION IN WHICH ONE FINDS ONESELF TRANSPLANTED THE GREATER IS THE SUFFERING
47-122796-0070 EVERYDAY NECESSITY IS THE STAGNANT POOL OF LIFE NO LOVELY PICTURE REFLECTS ITSELF THEREIN LIEUTENANT LOVE AND LACK OF MONEY THAT IS A SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE OR MUCH THE SAME AS THE HALF OF THE SHATTERED DIE OF FORTUNE
47-122796-0071 THIS THE LIEUTENANT FELT MOST POIGNANTLY AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE LEANT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW AND SIGHED SO DEEPLY
47-122796-0072 HE HAS A HOME A WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO WEEP WITH HIM OVER HIS SORROWS WHO REJOICE WITH HIM WHEN HE IS GLAD
47-122796-0073 OH HE IS A HUNDRED TIMES HAPPIER THAN I
47-122796-0074 HE TOOK UPON HIM THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE OFFICER BUT AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN HE FELT HIMSELF IN HIS NEW SITUATION MUCH LESS CONTENTED AND NOW PREFERRED THE VERY THING WHICH BUT SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE HAD REJECTED SO THEN THE WATCHMAN WAS AGAIN WATCHMAN
47-122796-0075 THAT WAS AN UNPLEASANT DREAM SAID HE BUT TWAS DROLL ENOUGH ALTOGETHER
47-122796-0076 I MISSED MY GOOD OLD MOTHER AND THE DEAR LITTLE ONES WHO ALMOST TEAR ME TO PIECES FOR SHEER LOVE HE SEATED HIMSELF ONCE MORE AND NODDED THE DREAM CONTINUED TO HAUNT HIM FOR HE STILL HAD THE SHOES ON HIS FEET A FALLING STAR SHONE IN THE DARK FIRMAMENT
47-122796-0077 THERE FALLS ANOTHER STAR SAID HE BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER THERE ARE ALWAYS ENOUGH LEFT I SHOULD NOT MUCH MIND EXAMINING THE LITTLE GLIMMERING THINGS SOMEWHAT NEARER ESPECIALLY THE MOON FOR THAT WOULD NOT SLIP SO EASILY THROUGH A MAN'S FINGERS WHEN WE DIE
47-122796-0078 WE SHALL FLY ABOUT AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER FROM ONE SUCH A STAR TO THE OTHER THAT'S OF COURSE NOT TRUE BUT TWOULD BE PRETTY ENOUGH IF IT WERE SO IF I COULD BUT ONCE TAKE A LEAP UP THERE MY BODY MIGHT STAY HERE ON THE STEPS FOR WHAT I CARE
47-122796-0079 BUT DOUBLY CAREFUL MUST ONE BE WHEN WE HAVE THE SHOES OF FORTUNE ON OUR FEET NOW JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WATCHMAN
47-122796-0080 EVERY INCH A MAN RESEMBLING THE REAL PERSONAGES EVEN TO THE FINEST FEATURES AND BECOME THE HEROES OR HEROINES OF OUR WORLD OF DREAMS IN REALITY SUCH REMEMBRANCES ARE RATHER UNPLEASANT EVERY SIN EVERY EVIL THOUGHT MAY LIKE A CLOCK WITH ALARM OR CHIMES
47-122796-0081 BE REPEATED AT PLEASURE THEN THE QUESTION IS IF WE CAN TRUST OURSELVES TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF EVERY UNBECOMING WORD IN OUR HEART AND ON OUR LIPS
47-122796-0082 THE PROPER AUTHORITIES WERE INFORMED OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE PEOPLE TALKED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT IT AND IN THE MORNING THE BODY WAS CARRIED TO THE HOSPITAL NOW THAT WOULD BE A VERY PRETTY JOKE IF THE SPIRIT WHEN IT CAME BACK AND LOOKED FOR THE BODY IN EAST STREET WERE NOT TO FIND ONE
47-122796-0083 NO DOUBT IT WOULD IN ITS ANXIETY RUN OFF TO THE POLICE AND THEN TO THE HUE AND CRY OFFICE TO ANNOUNCE THAT
47-122796-0084 YET WE MAY BOLDLY ASSERT THAT THE SOUL IS SHREWDEST WHEN IT SHAKES OFF EVERY FETTER AND EVERY SORT OF LEADING STRING THE BODY ONLY MAKES IT STUPID THE SEEMINGLY DEAD BODY OF THE WATCHMAN WANDERED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE HOSPITAL
47-122796-0085 AND THE FIRST THING THAT WAS DONE HERE WAS NATURALLY TO PULL OFF THE GALOSHES WHEN THE SPIRIT THAT WAS MERELY GONE OUT ON ADVENTURES MUST HAVE RETURNED WITH THE QUICKNESS OF LIGHTNING TO ITS EARTHLY TENEMENT IT TOOK ITS DIRECTION TOWARDS THE BODY IN A STRAIGHT LINE
47-122796-0086 AND A FEW SECONDS AFTER LIFE BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF IN THE MAN HE ASSERTED THAT THE PRECEDING NIGHT HAD BEEN THE WORST THAT EVER THE MALICE OF FATE HAD ALLOTTED HIM HE WOULD NOT FOR TWO SILVER MARKS AGAIN GO THROUGH WHAT HE HAD ENDURED WHILE MOON STRICKEN BUT NOW HOWEVER IT WAS OVER
47-122796-0087 BUT THE SHOES MEANWHILE REMAINED BEHIND FOUR A MOMENT OF HEAD IMPORTANCE AN EVENING'S DRAMATIC READINGS A MOST STRANGE JOURNEY EVERY INHABITANT OF COPENHAGEN KNOWS FROM PERSONAL INSPECTION HOW THE ENTRANCE TO FREDERICK'S HOSPITAL LOOKS
47-122796-0088 MAY ALSO READ THIS LITTLE WORK WE WILL BEFOREHAND GIVE A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF IT THE EXTENSIVE BUILDING IS SEPARATED FROM THE STREET BY A PRETTY HIGH RAILING THE THICK IRON BARS OF WHICH ARE SO FAR APART THAT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
47-122796-0089 THE PART OF THE BODY MOST DIFFICULT TO MANAGE ON SUCH OCCASIONS WAS NO DOUBT THE HEAD
47-122796-0090 LONG HEADED PEOPLE GET THROUGH BEST SO MUCH THEN FOR THE INTRODUCTION ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOSE HEAD IN A PHYSICAL SENSE ONLY MIGHT BE SAID TO BE OF THE THICKEST
47-122796-0091 HAD THE WATCH THAT EVENING THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS YET DESPITE THESE TWO OBSTACLES THE YOUNG MAN WAS OBLIGED TO GO OUT IF IT WERE BUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND AS TO TELLING THE DOOR KEEPER ABOUT IT THAT HE THOUGHT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY
47-122796-0092 IF WITH A WHOLE SKIN HE WERE ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH THE RAILINGS THERE ON THE FLOOR LAY THE GALOSHES WHICH THE WATCHMAN HAD FORGOTTEN HE NEVER DREAMED FOR A MOMENT THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF FORTUNE
47-122796-0093 SO HE PUT THEM ON THE QUESTION NOW WAS IF HE COULD SQUEEZE HIMSELF THROUGH THE GRATING FOR HE HAD NEVER TRIED BEFORE WELL THERE HE STOOD WOULD TO HEAVEN I HAD GOT MY HEAD THROUGH SAID HE INVOLUNTARILY
47-122796-0094 AND INSTANTLY THROUGH IT SLIPPED EASILY AND WITHOUT PAIN NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS PRETTY LARGE AND THICK BUT NOW THE REST OF THE BODY WAS TO BE GOT THROUGH AH I AM MUCH TOO STOUT GROANED HE ALOUD WHILE FIXED AS IN A VICE
47-122796-0095 OH OH I REALLY CANNOT SQUEEZE MYSELF THROUGH HE NOW WANTED TO PULL HIS OVER HASTY HEAD BACK AGAIN BUT HE COULD NOT FOR HIS NECK THERE WAS ROOM ENOUGH BUT FOR NOTHING MORE HIS FIRST FEELING WAS OF ANGER HIS NEXT THAT HIS TEMPER FELL TO ZERO
47-122796-0096 THE SHOES OF FORTUNE HAD PLACED HIM IN THE MOST DREADFUL SITUATION AND UNFORTUNATELY IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM TO WISH HIMSELF FREE THE PITCH BLACK CLOUDS POURED DOWN THEIR CONTENTS IN STILL HEAVIER TORRENTS NOT A CREATURE WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE STREETS TO REACH UP TO THE BELL WAS WHAT HE DID NOT LIKE
47-122796-0097 BESIDES HOW ASHAMED WOULD HE HAVE BEEN TO BE FOUND CAUGHT IN A TRAP LIKE AN OUTWITTED FOX HOW WAS HE TO TWIST HIMSELF THROUGH HE SAW CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HIS IRREVOCABLE DESTINY TO REMAIN A PRISONER TILL DAWN OR PERHAPS EVEN LATE IN THE MORNING
47-122796-0098 THEN THE SMITH MUST BE FETCHED TO FILE AWAY THE BARS BUT ALL THAT WOULD NOT BE DONE SO QUICKLY AS HE COULD THINK ABOUT IT THE WHOLE CHARITY SCHOOL JUST OPPOSITE WOULD BE IN MOTION ALL THE NEW BOOTHS WITH THEIR NOT VERY COURTIER LIKE SWARM OF SEAMEN
47-122796-0099 WOULD JOIN THEM OUT OF CURIOSITY AND WOULD GREET HIM WITH A WILD HURRAH WHILE HE WAS STANDING IN HIS PILLORY THERE WOULD BE A MOB A HISSING AND REJOICING AND JEERING TEN TIMES WORSE THAN IN THE ROWS ABOUT THE JEWS SOME YEARS AGO
47-122796-0100 OH MY BLOOD IS MOUNTING TO MY BRAIN TIS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD I SHALL GO WILD I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO OH WERE I BUT LOOSE MY DIZZINESS WOULD THEN CEASE OH WERE MY HEAD BUT LOOSE
47-122796-0101 HE HASTENED OFF TO HIS ROOM WHERE THE PAINS CONSEQUENT ON THE FRIGHT THE SHOES HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DID NOT SO SOON TAKE THEIR LEAVE BUT YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT THE AFFAIR IS OVER NOW IT GROWS MUCH WORSE THE NIGHT PASSED THE NEXT DAY ALSO
47-122796-0102 BUT NOBODY CAME TO FETCH THE SHOES IN THE EVENING DRAMATIC READINGS WERE TO BE GIVEN AT THE LITTLE THEATRE IN KING STREET THE HOUSE WAS FILLED TO SUFFOCATION AND AMONG OTHER PIECES TO BE RECITED WAS A NEW POEM BY H C ANDERSEN CALLED MY AUNT'S SPECTACLES
47-122796-0103 THE CONTENTS OF WHICH WERE PRETTY NEARLY AS FOLLOWS A CERTAIN PERSON HAD AN AUNT WHO BOASTED OF PARTICULAR SKILL IN FORTUNE TELLING WITH CARDS AND WHO WAS CONSTANTLY BEING STORMED BY PERSONS THAT WANTED TO HAVE A PEEP INTO FUTURITY BUT SHE WAS FULL OF MYSTERY ABOUT HER ART
47-122796-0104 IN WHICH A CERTAIN PAIR OF MAGIC SPECTACLES DID HER ESSENTIAL SERVICE HER NEPHEW A MERRY BOY WHO WAS HIS AUNT'S DARLING BEGGED SO LONG FOR THESE SPECTACLES THAT AT LAST SHE LENT HIM THE TREASURE AFTER HAVING INFORMED HIM WITH MANY EXHORTATIONS
47-122796-0105 THAT IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE INTERESTING TRICK HE NEED ONLY REPAIR TO SOME PLACE WHERE A GREAT MANY PERSONS WERE ASSEMBLED AND THEN FROM A HIGHER POSITION WHENCE HE COULD OVERLOOK THE CROWD PASS THE COMPANY IN REVIEW BEFORE HIM THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES IMMEDIATELY
47-122796-0106 YET WITHOUT EXPRESSING HIS OPINION OPENLY HE TELLS THE PEOPLE ENOUGH TO SET THEM ALL THINKING AND GUESSING BUT IN ORDER TO HURT NOBODY HE WRAPS HIS WITTY ORACULAR JUDGMENTS IN A TRANSPARENT VEIL OR RATHER IN A LURID THUNDERCLOUD SHOOTING FORTH BRIGHT SPARKS OF WIT
47-122796-0107 THAT THEY MAY FALL IN THE POWDER MAGAZINE OF THE EXPECTANT AUDIENCE THE HUMOROUS POEM WAS ADMIRABLY RECITED AND THE SPEAKER MUCH APPLAUDED
47-122796-0108 HE HAD ON THE SHOES FOR AS YET NO LAWFUL OWNER HAD APPEARED TO CLAIM THEM AND BESIDES IT WAS SO VERY DIRTY OUT OF DOORS THEY WERE JUST THE THING FOR HIM HE THOUGHT THE BEGINNING OF THE POEM HE PRAISED WITH GREAT GENEROSITY HE EVEN FOUND THE IDEA ORIGINAL AND EFFECTIVE
47-122796-0109 BUT THAT THE END OF IT LIKE THE RHINE WAS VERY INSIGNIFICANT PROVED IN HIS OPINION THE AUTHOR'S WANT OF INVENTION HE WAS WITHOUT GENIUS ET CETERA THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SAID SOMETHING CLEVER MEANWHILE HE WAS HAUNTED BY THE IDEA
47-122796-0110 I CAN NOW SAID HE TO HIMSELF FANCY THE WHOLE ROW OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SITTING THERE IN THE FRONT ROW IF ONE COULD BUT SEE INTO THEIR HEARTS YES THAT WOULD BE A REVELATION A SORT OF BAZAR
47-122796-0111 IN THAT LADY YONDER SO STRANGELY DRESSED I SHOULD FIND FOR CERTAIN A LARGE MILLINER'S SHOP IN THAT ONE THE SHOP IS EMPTY BUT IT WANTS CLEANING PLAIN ENOUGH
47-122796-0112 ALAS SIGHED HE I KNOW ONE IN WHICH ALL IS STATELY BUT THERE SITS ALREADY A SPRUCE YOUNG SHOPMAN WHICH IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S AMISS IN THE WHOLE SHOP ALL WOULD BE SPLENDIDLY DECKED OUT AND WE SHOULD HEAR
47-122796-0113 WALK IN GENTLEMEN PRAY WALK IN HERE YOU WILL FIND ALL YOU PLEASE TO WANT AH I WISH TO HEAVEN I COULD WALK IN AND TAKE A TRIP RIGHT THROUGH THE HEARTS OF THOSE PRESENT AND BEHOLD TO THE SHOES OF FORTUNE THIS WAS THE CUE
47-122796-0114 THE FIRST HEART THROUGH WHICH HE CAME WAS THAT OF A MIDDLE AGED LADY BUT HE INSTANTLY FANCIED HIMSELF IN THE ROOM OF THE INSTITUTION FOR THE CURE OF THE CROOKED AND DEFORMED WHERE CASTS OF MIS SHAPEN LIMBS ARE DISPLAYED IN NAKED REALITY ON THE WALL
47-122796-0115 YET THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTITUTION THE CASTS WERE TAKEN AT THE ENTRY OF THE PATIENT
47-122796-0116 WHILE THE SOUND PERSONS WENT AWAY THEY WERE NAMELY CASTS OF FEMALE FRIENDS WHOSE BODILY OR MENTAL DEFORMITIES WERE HERE MOST FAITHFULLY PRESERVED WITH THE SNAKE LIKE WRITHINGS OF AN IDEA HE GLIDED INTO ANOTHER FEMALE HEART BUT THIS SEEMED TO HIM LIKE A LARGE HOLY FANE
47-122796-0117 THE WHITE DOVE OF INNOCENCE FLUTTERED OVER THE ALTAR HOW GLADLY WOULD HE HAVE SUNK UPON HIS KNEES BUT HE MUST AWAY TO THE NEXT HEART
47-122796-0118 WITH A SICK BED RID MOTHER REVEALED BUT GOD'S WARM SUN STREAMED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW LOVELY ROSES NODDED FROM THE WOODEN FLOWER BOXES ON THE ROOF
47-122796-0119 WHOSE NAME IS CERTAIN TO BE FOUND IN THE DIRECTORY
47-122796-0120 THE HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT WAS USED AS A WEATHER COCK WHICH WAS CONNECTED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER WITH THE DOORS AND SO THEY OPENED AND SHUT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WHENEVER THE STERN OLD HUSBAND TURNED ROUND HEREUPON HE WANDERED INTO A BOUDOIR FORMED ENTIRELY OF MIRRORS LIKE THE ONE IN CASTLE ROSENBURG
47-122796-0121 BUT HERE THE GLASSES MAGNIFIED TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE ON THE FLOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM SAT LIKE A DALAI LAMA THE INSIGNIFICANT SELF OF THE PERSON QUITE CONFOUNDED AT HIS OWN GREATNESS HE THEN IMAGINED HE HAD GOT INTO A NEEDLE CASE FULL OF POINTED NEEDLES OF EVERY SIZE
47-122796-0122 A MAN AS PEOPLE SAID OF TALENT AND FEELING IN THE GREATEST PERPLEXITY HE NOW CAME OUT OF THE LAST HEART IN THE ROW HE WAS UNABLE TO PUT HIS THOUGHTS IN ORDER AND FANCIED THAT HIS TOO LIVELY IMAGINATION HAD RUN AWAY WITH HIM
47-122796-0123 AND HE NOW REMEMBERED THE IMPORTANT EVENT OF THE EVENING BEFORE HOW HIS HEAD HAD GOT JAMMED IN BETWEEN THE IRON RAILINGS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT'S WHAT IT IS NO DOUBT SAID HE I MUST DO SOMETHING IN TIME UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUSSIAN BATH MIGHT DO ME GOOD
47-122796-0124 AND AS HE GETS ACCUSTOMED TO THE HEAT MOVES TO ANOTHER HIGHER UP TOWARDS THE CEILING WHERE OF COURSE THE VAPOR IS WARMEST IN THIS MANNER HE ASCENDS GRADUALLY TO THE HIGHEST AND SO THERE HE LAY ON THE UPPERMOST BANK IN THE VAPOR BATH
47-122796-0125 BUT WITH ALL HIS CLOTHES ON IN HIS BOOTS AND GALOSHES WHILE THE HOT DROPS FELL SCALDING FROM THE CEILING ON HIS FACE HOLLOA CRIED HE LEAPING DOWN THE BATHING ATTENDANT ON HIS SIDE UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE BEHELD IN THE BATH A MAN COMPLETELY DRESSED
47-122796-0126 THE OTHER HOWEVER RETAINED SUFFICIENT PRESENCE OF MIND TO WHISPER TO HIM TIS A BET AND I HAVE WON IT BUT THE FIRST THING HE DID AS SOON AS HE GOT HOME WAS TO HAVE A LARGE BLISTER PUT ON HIS CHEST AND BACK TO DRAW OUT HIS MADNESS
47-122796-0127 THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD A SORE CHEST AND A BLEEDING BACK AND EXCEPTING THE FRIGHT THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD GAINED BY THE SHOES OF FORTUNE FIVE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE COPYING CLERK THE WATCHMAN
47-122796-0128 WHOM WE HAVE CERTAINLY NOT FORGOTTEN THOUGHT MEANWHILE OF THE GALOSHES HE HAD FOUND AND TAKEN WITH HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
47-122796-0129 AS ON THE CONTINENT IN ALL LAW AND POLICE PRACTICES NOTHING IS VERBAL BUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER TRIFLING IS REDUCED TO WRITING THE LABOR AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT THUS ACCUMULATE IS ENORMOUS
47-122796-0130 IN A POLICE OFFICE CONSEQUENTLY WE FIND COPYING CLERKS AMONG MANY OTHER SCRIBES OF VARIOUS DENOMINATIONS OF WHICH IT SEEMS OUR HERO WAS ONE
47-122796-0131 ONE MUST HAVE MORE THAN THE EYE OF A SHOEMAKER TO KNOW ONE PAIR FROM THE OTHER SAID HE SOLILOQUIZING AND PUTTING AT THE SAME TIME THE GALOSHES IN SEARCH OF AN OWNER BESIDE HIS OWN IN THE CORNER HERE SIR SAID ONE OF THE MEN WHO PANTING BROUGHT HIM A TREMENDOUS PILE OF PAPERS
47-122796-0132 THE COPYING CLERK TURNED ROUND AND SPOKE AWHILE WITH THE MAN ABOUT THE REPORTS AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION BUT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND HIS EYE FELL AGAIN ON THE SHOES HE WAS UNABLE TO SAY WHETHER THOSE TO THE LEFT OR THOSE TO THE RIGHT BELONGED TO HIM
47-122796-0133 AT ALL EVENTS IT MUST BE THOSE WHICH ARE WET THOUGHT HE BUT THIS TIME IN SPITE OF HIS CLEVERNESS HE GUESSED QUITE WRONG
47-122796-0134 SO HE PUT THEM ON QUICKLY STUCK HIS PAPERS IN HIS POCKET AND TOOK BESIDES A FEW UNDER HIS ARM INTENDING TO LOOK THEM THROUGH AT HOME TO MAKE THE NECESSARY NOTES IT WAS NOON AND THE WEATHER THAT HAD THREATENED RAIN BEGAN TO CLEAR UP WHILE GAILY DRESSED HOLIDAY FOLKS FILLED THE STREETS
47-122796-0135 TIS A BITTER CRUST ALAS AT WHICH I AM CONDEMNED TO GNAW NOBODY COULD BE MORE STEADY OR QUIET THAN THIS YOUNG MAN WE THEREFORE WISH HIM JOY OF THE EXCURSION WITH ALL OUR HEART AND
47-122796-0136 SO YOU ARE GOING AWAY AGAIN SAID THE CLERK YOU ARE A VERY FREE AND HAPPY BEING WE OTHERS ARE CHAINED BY THE LEG AND HELD FAST TO OUR DESK YES BUT IT IS A CHAIN FRIEND WHICH ENSURES YOU THE BLESSED BREAD OF EXISTENCE ANSWERED THE POET
47-122796-0137 EACH ONE KEPT TO HIS OWN OPINION AND SO THEY SEPARATED IT'S A STRANGE RACE THOSE POETS SAID THE CLERK WHO WAS VERY FOND OF SOLILOQUIZING I SHOULD LIKE SOME DAY JUST FOR A TRIAL TO TAKE SUCH NATURE UPON ME AND BE A POET MYSELF
47-122796-0138 I AM VERY SURE I SHOULD MAKE NO SUCH MISERABLE VERSES AS THE OTHERS TODAY METHINKS IS A MOST DELICIOUS DAY FOR A POET NATURE SEEMS ANEW TO CELEBRATE HER AWAKENING INTO LIFE THE AIR IS SO UNUSUALLY CLEAR THE CLOUDS SAIL ON SO BUOYANTLY
47-122796-0139 AND FROM THE GREEN HERBAGE A FRAGRANCE IS EXHALED THAT FILLS ME WITH DELIGHT FOR MANY A YEAR HAVE I NOT FELT AS AT THIS MOMENT WE SEE ALREADY BY THE FOREGOING EFFUSION THAT HE IS BECOME A POET TO GIVE FURTHER PROOF OF IT HOWEVER WOULD IN MOST CASES BE INSIPID
47-122796-0140 FOR IT IS A MOST FOOLISH NOTION TO FANCY A POET DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN AMONG THE LATTER THERE MAY BE FAR MORE POETICAL NATURES THAN MANY AN ACKNOWLEDGED POET WHEN EXAMINED MORE CLOSELY COULD BOAST OF
47-122796-0141 THE DIFFERENCE ONLY IS THAT THE POET POSSESSES A BETTER MENTAL MEMORY ON WHICH ACCOUNT HE IS ABLE TO RETAIN THE FEELING AND THE THOUGHT TILL THEY CAN BE EMBODIED BY MEANS OF WORDS A FACULTY WHICH THE OTHERS DO NOT POSSESS BUT THE TRANSITION FROM A COMMONPLACE NATURE
47-122796-0142 THE SWEET AIR CONTINUED HE OF THE POLICE OFFICE IN HIS DREAMY IMAGININGS HOW IT REMINDS ME OF THE VIOLETS IN THE GARDEN OF MY AUNT MAGDALENA YES THEN I WAS A LITTLE WILD BOY WHO DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL VERY REGULARLY O HEAVENS
47-122796-0143 THE GOOD OLD SOUL SHE LIVED BEHIND THE EXCHANGE SHE ALWAYS HAD A FEW TWIGS OR GREEN SHOOTS IN WATER LET THE WINTER RAGE WITHOUT AS IT MIGHT THE VIOLETS EXHALED THEIR SWEET BREATH
47-122796-0144 WHAT CHANGE WHAT MAGNIFICENCE YONDER IN THE CANAL LAY THE SHIPS FROZEN UP AND DESERTED BY THEIR WHOLE CREWS WITH A SCREAMING CROW FOR THE SOLE OCCUPANT BUT WHEN THE SPRING WITH A GENTLE STIRRING MOTION ANNOUNCED HER ARRIVAL A NEW AND BUSY LIFE AROSE
47-122796-0145 WITH SONGS AND HURRAHS THE ICE WAS SAWN ASUNDER THE SHIPS WERE FRESH TARRED AND RIGGED THAT THEY MIGHT SAIL AWAY TO DISTANT LANDS BUT I HAVE REMAINED HERE
47-122796-0146 MUST ALWAYS REMAIN HERE SITTING AT MY DESK IN THE OFFICE AND PATIENTLY SEE OTHER PEOPLE FETCH THEIR PASSPORTS TO GO ABROAD SUCH IS MY FATE
47-122796-0147 WAS AGAIN SILENT GREAT HEAVEN WHAT IS COME TO ME
47-122796-0148 HE SAID TO HIMSELF CONSOLINGLY WHILE HIS EYE RAN OVER THE FIRST PAGE DAME TIGBRITH TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS WHAT IS THAT AND YET IT IS UNDENIABLY MY OWN HANDWRITING HAVE I WRITTEN THE TRAGEDY WONDERFUL VERY WONDERFUL AND THIS WHAT HAVE I HERE
47-122796-0149 HEM HEM SAID THE CLERK BREATHLESSLY AND QUITE EXHAUSTED HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A BANK
