5717-100145-0000 HE INFORMED THEM THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO DEBATE THEY WERE CONFRONTED WITH AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT WHICH THEY MUST ACCEPT SO NIKKOLON MADE A SPEECH TELLING THEM AT WHAT A GREAT MOMENT IN ADITYAN HISTORY THEY STOOD AND CONCLUDED BY SAYING
5717-100145-0001 I TAKE IT THAT IT IS THE UNANIMOUS WILL OF THIS CONVOCATION THAT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE GALACTIC EMPEROR BE ACKNOWLEDGED
5717-100145-0002 DO HERE PROCLAIM OUR LOYAL ALLEGIANCE TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY RODRIK THE THIRD ANY DISSENT THEN IT IS ORDERED SO RECORDED THEN HE HAD TO MAKE ANOTHER SPEECH
5717-100145-0003 TO INFORM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF HIS NEW SOVEREIGN OF THE FACT PRINCE TREVANNION IN THE NAME OF THE EMPEROR DELIVERED THE WELL WORN WORDS OF WELCOME AND
5717-100145-0004 AND THE IMPERIAL PROCONSUL OBRAY COUNT ERSKYLL WAS CROWNED ERSKYLL'S CHARGE D'AFFAIRES SHARLL ERNANDAY PRODUCED THE SCROLL OF THE IMPERIAL CONSTITUTION AND ERSKYLL BEGAN TO READ
5717-100145-0005 SECTION ONE THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE EMPIRE THE ABSOLUTE POWERS OF THE EMPEROR THE RULES OF SUCCESSION THE EMPEROR ALSO TO BE PLANETARY KING OF ODIN SECTION TWO
5717-100145-0006 EVERY PLANETARY GOVERNMENT TO BE SOVEREIGN IN ITS OWN INTERNAL AFFAIRS ONLY ONE SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT UPON ANY PLANET OR WITHIN NORMAL SPACE TRAVEL DISTANCE ALL HYPERSPACE SHIPS AND ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS
5717-100145-0007 NO PLANETARY GOVERNMENT SHALL MAKE WAR ENTER INTO ANY ALLIANCE TAX REGULATE OR RESTRAIN INTERSTELLAR TRADE OR COMMUNICATION EVERY SAPIENT BEING SHALL BE EQUALLY PROTECTED
5717-100145-0008 THEN HE CAME TO ARTICLE SIX HE CLEARED HIS THROAT RAISED HIS VOICE AND READ THERE SHALL BE NO CHATTEL SLAVERY OR SERFDOM ANYWHERE IN THE EMPIRE NO SAPIENT BEING OF ANY RACE WHATSOEVER
5717-100145-0009 SHALL BE THE PROPERTY OF ANY BEING BUT HIMSELF THE CONVOCATION CHAMBER WAS SILENT LIKE A BOMB WITH A DEFECTIVE FUSE FOR ALL OF THIRTY SECONDS
5717-100145-0010 LIKE A TROPICAL CLOUDBURST ON A PREFAB HUT OLVIR NIKKOLON'S MOUTH WAS WORKING AS HE SHOUTED UNHEARD HE PRESSED ANOTHER OF THE ROW OF BUTTONS ON THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR OUT OF THE SCREEN SPEAKER A VOICE
5717-100145-0011 AS LOUD BY ACTUAL SOUND METER TEST AS AN ANTI VEHICLE GUN THUNDERED SILENCE INTO THE SHOCKED STILLNESS WHICH IT PRODUCED HE SPOKE
5717-100145-0012 LIKE A SCHOOLMASTER WHO HAS RETURNED TO FIND HIS ROOM IN AN UPROAR LORD NIKKOLON WHAT IS THIS NONSENSE YOU ARE CHAIRMAN OF THE PRESIDIUM
5717-100145-0013 YOU TRICKED US NIKKOLON ACCUSED YOU DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT THAT ARTICLE WHEN WE VOTED WHY OUR WHOLE SOCIETY IS BASED ON SLAVERY OTHER VOICES JOINED IN THAT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU PEOPLE YOU HAVE ROBOTS
5717-100145-0014 MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW IT BUT THERE ARE TWENTY MILLION SLAVES ON THIS PLANET LOOK YOU CAN'T FREE SLAVES THAT'S RIDICULOUS A SLAVE'S A SLAVE WHO'LL DO THE WORK AND WHO WOULD THEY BELONG TO THEY'D HAVE TO BELONG TO SOMEBODY
5717-100145-0015 WHAT I WANT TO KNOW ROVARD JAVASAN MADE HIMSELF HEARD IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FREE THEM THERE WAS AN ANCIENT WORD ORIGINATING IN ONE OF THE LOST LANGUAGES OF PRE ATOMIC TERRA
5717-100145-0016 IT MEANT THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION
5717-100145-0017 OF COURSE OBRAY COUNT ERSKYLL PLANETARY PROCONSUL OF ADITYA DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT JAVASAN MEANT JUST FREE THEM COMMODORE VANN SHATRAK COULDN'T SEE MUCH OF A PROBLEM EITHER HE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED
5717-100145-0018 JUST FREE THEM AND THEN SHOOT DOWN THE FIRST TWO OR THREE THOUSAND WHO TOOK IT SERIOUSLY JURGEN PRINCE TREVANNION HAD NO INTENTION WHATEVER OF ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER THE SIXTIFOR MY DEAR LORD JAVASAN
5717-100145-0019 THAT IS THE PROBLEM OF THE ADITYAN MASTERSHIP THEY ARE YOUR SLAVES WE HAVE NEITHER THE INTENTION NOR THE RIGHT TO FREE THEM BUT LET ME REMIND YOU THAT SLAVERY IS SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED BY THE IMPERIAL CONSTITUTION
5717-100145-0020 A FEW LOOKED APPREHENSIVELY AT THE CEILING AS THOUGH EXPECTING THE HELLBURNERS AND PLANET BUSTERS AND NEGA MATTER BOMBS AT ANY MOMENT THEN ONE OF THE MEMBERS AMONG THE BENCHES ROSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO IT PRINCE TREVANNION HE SAID
5717-100145-0021 WILL DO IT SINCE THIS IS THE EMPIRE LAW BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL US HOW WELL THE FIRST THING WILL HAVE TO BE AN ACT OF CONVOCATION OUTLAWING THE OWNERSHIP OF ONE BEING BY ANOTHER
5717-100145-0022 THAT NEED NOT BE TOO IMMEDIATE THEN I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU SET UP SOME AGENCY TO HANDLE ALL THE DETAILS AND AS SOON AS YOU HAVE ENACTED THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY WHICH SHOULD BE THIS AFTERNOON
5717-100145-0023 I HOPE FOR THE LAST TIME THAT WE DISCUSS MATTERS DIRECTLY WITHOUT INTERMEDIARIES WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE SLAVES PARDON FREEDMEN COMING ABOARD TO TALK FOR YOU AS HAPPENED YESTERDAY OBRAY COUNT ERSKYLL WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT IT
5717-100145-0024 TO FIX A BROKEN MOUSE TRAP LINE COMMODORE VANN SHATRAK WAS ALSO WORRIED HE WAS WONDERING HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE FOR PYAIRR RAVNEY TO MAKE USEFUL TROOPS OUT OF THE NEWLY SURRENDERED SLAVE SOLDIERS
5717-100145-0025 AND WHERE HE WAS GOING TO FIND CONTRAGRAVITY TO SHIFT THEM EXPEDITIOUSLY FROM TROUBLE SPOT TO TROUBLE SPOT ERSKYLL THOUGHT HE WAS ANTICIPATING RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF THE MASTERS AND FOR ONCE HE APPROVED THE USE OF FORCE
5717-100145-0026 BEGINNING WITH THE PRE DINNER COCKTAILS AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE MEAL BY THE TIME THEY RETIRED FOR COFFEE AND BRANDY TO THE PARLOR WHERE THE CONFERENCE WAS TO BE HELD THE LORDS EX MASTERS WERE ALMOST FRIENDLY WE'VE ENACTED THE EMANCIPATION ACT
5717-100145-0027 OLVIR NIKKOLON WHO WAS EX OFFICIO CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE REPORTED EVERY SLAVE ON THE PLANET MUST BE FREE BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE NEXT MIDYEAR FEASTS AND WHEN WILL THAT BE ADITYA HE KNEW HAD A THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT DAY YEAR
5717-100145-0028 EVEN IF THE MIDYEAR FEASTS WERE JUST PAST THEY WERE GIVING THEMSELVES VERY LITTLE TIME IN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS NIKKOLON SAID GOOD HEAVENS ERSKYLL BEGAN INDIGNANTLY
5717-100145-0029 AND YOU HAVE TWENTY MILLION SLAVES TO DEAL WITH IF YOU START AT THIS MOMENT AND WORK CONTINUOUSLY YOU'LL HAVE A LITTLE UNDER A SECOND APIECE FOR EACH SLAVE THE LORDS MASTER LOOKED DISMAYED SO HE WAS HAPPY TO OBSERVE
5717-100145-0030 ROVARD JAVASAN ASSURED HIM THAT'S YOUR MANAGEMENT ISN'T IT SESAR SERVILE AFFAIRS YES WE HAVE COMPLETE DATA ON EVERY SLAVE ON THE PLANET
5717-100145-0031 JAVASAN SAID I MUST SAY THEY ARE MUCH DISTURBED WELL REASSURE THEM AS SOON AS YOU'RE BACK AT THE CITADEL HE TOLD THEM TELL THEM THAT WHILE THEY ARE NOW FREE THEY NEED NOT LEAVE YOU UNLESS THEY SO DESIRE THAT YOU WILL PROVIDE FOR THEM AS BEFORE
5717-100145-0032 YOU MEAN WE CAN KEEP OUR CHIEF SLAVES SOMEBODY CRIED YES OF COURSE CHIEF FREEDMEN YOU'LL HAVE TO CALL THEM NOW YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY THEM A SALARY YOU MEAN GIVE THEM MONEY
5717-100145-0033 RANAL VALDRY THE LORD PROVOST MARSHAL DEMANDED INCREDULOUSLY PAY OUR OWN SLAVES YOU IDIOT SOMEBODY TOLD HIM THEY AREN'T OUR SLAVES ANY MORE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS DISCUSSION
5717-100145-0034 THE UNIT WAS THE STAR PIECE THE STELLY WHEN HE ASKED TO SEE SOME OF IT THEY WERE INDIGNANT NOBODY CARRIED MONEY WASN'T MASTERLY A MASTER NEVER EVEN TOUCHED THE STUFF THAT WAS WHAT SLAVES WERE FOR
5717-100145-0035 HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW IT WAS SECURED AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANT AND WHEN HE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THEIR INCOMPREHENSION DEEPENED IT SEEMED THAT THE MASTERSHIP ISSUED MONEY TO FINANCE ITSELF
5717-100145-0036 AND INDIVIDUAL MASTERS ISSUED MONEY ON THEIR PERSONAL CREDIT AND IT WAS HANDLED THROUGH THE MASTERSHIP BANKS THAT'S FEDRIG DAFFYSAN'S MANAGEMENT HE ISN'T HERE ROVARD JAVASAN SAID I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT MYSELF
