5840-54193-0000 LOVERS OF CHAMBER MUSIC FORM AN EXTREMELY REFINED AND CULTURED CLASS AND LIKE ALL HIGHLY REFINED AND CULTURED PEOPLE ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE THEY ARE THE PURISTS AMONG MUSIC LOVERS
5840-54193-0001 THE LAST PEOPLE WHO WOULD CARE TO SEE THE CLASSICAL FORMS ABANDONED AND WHO WOULD BE DISTURBED NOT TO SAY SHOCKED BY ANY GREAT DEPARTURE FROM THE SONATA FORM FOR THE STRING QUARTET IS TO CHAMBER MUSIC
5840-54193-0002 WHAT THE SYMPHONY IS TO ORCHESTRA AND THE SONATA TO THE PIANOFORTE IS IN FACT A SONATA FOR TWO VIOLINS VIOLA AND VIOLONCELLO JUST AS THE SYMPHONY IS A SONATA FOR ORCHESTRA
5840-54193-0003 ODDLY ENOUGH A PIANOFORTE SOLO IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN A LARGE HALL THAN A STRING QUARTET ALTHOUGH THE LATTER EMPLOYS FOUR TIMES AS MANY INSTRUMENTS
5840-54193-0004 AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF THOSE PIECES OF CHAMBER MUSIC IN WHICH THE PIANOFORTE IS USED SUCH AS SONATAS FOR PIANOFORTE AND VIOLIN OR VIOLONCELLO PIANOFORTE TRIOS QUARTETS
5840-54193-0005 QUINTETS AND SO ON A FINE SOLOIST ON THE PIANOFORTE WILL BE MORE AT HOME IN A LARGE AUDITORIUM LIKE CARNEGIE HALL OR EVEN THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE THAN WOULD A STRING QUARTET OR ANY OTHER COMBINATION
5840-54193-0006 OF CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYERS PADEREWSKI PLAYS IN CARNEGIE HALL AND I AM SURE WOULD BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN THE OPERA HOUSE BUT AN ORGANIZATION OF CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYERS WOULD BE LOST IN EITHER PLACE
5840-54193-0007 PLAYS IN NEW YORK IN MENDELSSOHN HALL A SMALL AUDITORIUM WHICH IS JUST ABOUT CORRECTLY PROPORTIONED FOR MUSIC OF THIS KIND INDEED COMPARED WITH THE OPERA THE ORCHESTRA
5840-54193-0008 AND EVEN WITH THE PIANOFORTE CHAMBER MUSIC REQUIRES A SETTING LIKE A JEWEL FOR JUST AS ITS DEVOTEES ARE THE PURISTS AMONG MUSIC LOVERS SO CHAMBER MUSIC ITSELF IS SOMETHING VERY PRECIOUS
5840-54193-0009 IT CERTAINLY IS A MOST CHARMING AND INTIMATE FORM OF MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT AND THE CONSTITUENCY OF A WELL ESTABLISHED STRING QUARTET INEVITABLY CONSISTS OF THE MUSICAL ELITE
5840-54193-0010 THE SAME OPINIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED REGARDING THE SONATAS AND THE SYMPHONIES OF THE GREAT COMPOSERS APPLY IN A GENERAL WAY TO THEIR CHAMBER MUSIC HAYDN'S IS NAIVE
5840-54193-0011 MOZART'S MORE EMOTIONAL IN EXPRESSION BEETHOVEN'S AMONG THAT OF CLASSICAL COMPOSERS THE MOST DRAMATIC IN FACT BEETHOVEN'S LAST QUARTETS IN WHICH THE INSTRUMENTS ARE EMPLOYED QUITE INDEPENDENTLY
5840-54193-0012 AND IN WHICH ROLES PRACTICALLY OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH ARE REGARDED BY RICHARD STRAUSS AS HAVING GIVEN THE CUE TO WAGNER FOR HIS POLYPHONIC TREATMENT OF THE ORCHESTRA
5840-54193-0013 AND WAGNER HIMSELF SPOKE OF THEM AS WORKS THROUGH WHICH MUSIC FIRST RAISED HERSELF TO AN EQUAL HEIGHT WITH THE POETRY AND PAINTING OF THE GREATEST PERIODS OF THE PAST
5840-54193-0014 NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE MANY WHO HOLD THAT IN HIS LAST QUARTETS BEETHOVEN SOUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH MORE THAN CAN BE EXPRESSED WITH FOUR STRINGED INSTRUMENTS AND PREFER HIS EARLIER WORKS OF THIS CLASS
5840-54193-0015 LIKE THE THREE RASUMOVSKI QUARTETS OPUS FIFTY NINE DEDICATED BY THE COMPOSER TO COUNT RASUMOVSKI WHO MAINTAINED A PRIVATE STRING QUARTET IN WHICH HE PLAYED SECOND VIOLIN
5840-54193-0016 THE OTHERS BEING PROFESSIONALS SCHUBERT'S MOST FAMOUS QUARTET IS THE ONE IN D MINOR WITH THE LOVELY SLOW MOVEMENT A THEME WITH VARIATIONS THE THEME BEING HIS OWN SONG
5840-54193-0017 DEATH AND THE MAIDEN ONE OF THE GREATEST WORKS IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF CHAMBER MUSIC IS HIS STRING QUINTET WITH TWO VIOLONCELLOS HIS PIANOFORTE TRIOS ALSO ARE NOBLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS BRANCH OF MUSICAL ART
5840-54193-0018 ONE GLANCE AT THIS TRIO WRITES SCHUMANN OF THE SCHUBERT TRIO IN B FLAT MAJOR AND ALL THE WRETCHEDNESS OF EXISTENCE IS PUT TO FLIGHT AND THE WORLD SEEMS YOUNG AGAIN MANY AND BEAUTIFUL AS ARE THE THINGS TIME BRINGS FORTH
5840-54193-0019 IT WILL BE LONG ERE IT PRODUCES ANOTHER SCHUBERT MENDELSSOHN'S CHAMBER MUSIC IS AS POLISHED AFFABLE AND GENTLEMANLY AS MOST OF HIS OTHER PRODUCTIONS
5840-54193-0020 AND RAPIDLY FALLING INTO THE SAME STATE OF UNLAMENTED DESUETUDE SCHUMANN HAS GIVEN US HIS LOVELY PIANOFORTE QUINTET IN E FLAT BRAHMS HAS CONTRIBUTED MUCH THAT IS NOTEWORTHY TO CHAMBER MUSIC
5840-54193-0021 AND AS A RULE IT IS LESS COMPLEX AND MORE INTELLIGENTLY SCORED THAN HIS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC
5840-54193-0022 OPUS FIFTY ONE INTRODUCES AS THE SECOND MOVEMENT A DUMKA OR BOHEMIAN ELEGY ONE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE OF HIS COMPOSITIONS FASCINATING IN HIS NATIONAL MUSICAL TINTS
5840-54193-0023 HE WAS GENIUS ENOUGH FOR HIS MUSIC TO BE UNIVERSAL IN ITS EXPRESSION
5840-54193-0024 WAS NO LESS ARTISTIC IN THE RESULTS HE ACCOMPLISHED WHEN DURING HIS RESIDENCE IN NEW YORK HE WROTE HIS STRING QUARTET IN F OPUS NINETY SIX ON NEGRO THEMES TSCHAIKOWSKY
5840-54193-0025 AND NEO RUSSIANS LIKE ARENSKY
