1274-121770-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A SOLITARY CHAPTER DURING ALL THAT WINTER I ATTENDED THE EVENING SCHOOL AND ASSISTED THE MASTER I CONFESS HOWEVER IT WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS
1274-121770-0001 SO MUCH FOR THE MASTER AS TO BE NEAR ELSIE DUFF OF WHOM I NOW THOUGHT MANY TIMES AN HOUR HER SWEET FACE GREW MORE AND MORE DEAR TO ME WHEN I POINTED OUT AN ERROR IN HER WORK OR SUGGESTED A BETTER MODE OF WORKING
1274-121770-0002 HER WHOLE MANNER A DUMB APOLOGY FOR WHAT COULD BE A FAULT IN NO EYES BUT HER OWN IT WAS THIS SWEETNESS THAT GAINED UPON ME AT LENGTH HER FACE WAS ALMOST A PART OF MY CONSCIOUSNESS
1274-121770-0003 I SUPPOSE MY CONDITION WAS WHAT PEOPLE WOULD CALL BEING IN LOVE WITH HER BUT I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT I ONLY THOUGHT OF HER NOR DID I EVER DREAM OF SAYING A WORD TO HER ON THE SUBJECT I WISHED NOTHING OTHER THAN AS IT WAS
1274-121770-0004 TO THINK ABOUT HER ALL DAY SO GENTLY THAT IT NEVER DISTURBED EUCLID OR LIVY TO SEE HER
1274-121770-0005 THAT A CHANGE MUST COME THAT AS LIFE CANNOT LINGER IN THE BUD BUT IS COMPELLED BY THE SUNSHINE AND AIR INTO THE FLOWER SO LIFE WOULD GO ON AND ON AND THINGS WOULD CHANGE AND THE TIME BLOSSOM INTO SOMETHING ELSE
1274-121770-0006 AND MY LOVE FIND ITSELF SET OUT OF DOORS IN THE MIDST OF STRANGE PLANTS AND A NEW ORDER OF THINGS WHEN SCHOOL WAS OVER I WALKED HOME WITH HER NOT ALONE FOR TURKEY WAS ALWAYS ON THE OTHER SIDE
1274-121770-0007 WE JOINED IN PRAISING HER BUT MY ADMIRATION EVER FOUND MORE WORDS THAN TURKEY'S AND I THOUGHT MY LOVE TO HER WAS GREATER THAN HIS WE SELDOM WENT INTO HER GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE FOR SHE DID NOT MAKE US WELCOME
1274-121770-0008 WITH WHOM WE WERE SURE OF A KIND RECEPTION SHE WAS A PATIENT DILIGENT WOMAN
1274-121770-0009 WHAT WAS HER DEEPEST THOUGHT WHETHER SHE WAS CONTENT TO BE UNHAPPY OR WHETHER SHE LIVED IN HOPE OF SOME BLESSEDNESS BEYOND IT IS MARVELLOUS WITH HOW LITTLE HAPPINESS SOME PEOPLE CAN GET THROUGH THE WORLD SURELY
1274-121770-0010 THEY ARE INWARDLY SUSTAINED WITH SOMETHING EVEN BETTER THAN JOY
1274-121770-0011 ASKED TURKEY AS WE SAT TOGETHER OVER HER LITTLE FIRE ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS NO I SHOULD LIKE VERY MUCH I ANSWERED THE ROOM WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY A LITTLE OIL LAMP FOR THERE WAS NO FLAME TO THE FIRE OF PEATS

1274-121770-0025 HE WOKE AND WAS ALL ALONE HER NIGHT ROBE LAY ON THE MARBLE GREY AND THE COLD SEA MAIDEN WAS GONE EVER AND AYE FRAE FIRST PEEP O THE MOON
1274-121770-0026 THE DESERT SHORE STILL UP AND DOON HEAVY AT HEART PACED HE BUT NEVER MORE CAME THE MAIDENS TO PLAY FROM THE MERRY COLD HEARTED SEA HE HEARD THEIR LAUGHTER FAR OUT AND AWAY
1274-121770-0027 BUT HEAVY AT HEART PACED HE I HAVE MODERNIZED THE BALLAD INDEED SPOILED IT ALTOGETHER FOR I HAVE MADE UP THIS VERSION FROM THE MEMORY OF IT WITH ONLY I FEAR JUST A TOUCH HERE AND THERE OF THE ORIGINAL EXPRESSION
1274-121770-0028 THAT'S WHAT COMES OF TAKING WHAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAID TURKEY IN WHOM THE PRACTICAL HAD EVER THE UPPER HAND
1274-121770-0029 AS WE WALKED HOME TOGETHER I RESUMED THE SUBJECT I THINK YOU'RE TOO HARD ON THE KING'S SON I SAID HE COULDN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE MERMAID HE HAD NO BUSINESS TO STEAL HER COMB AND THEN RUN AWAY WITH HERSELF SAID TURKEY
1274-121770-0030 SHE WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR IT SAID I WHO TOLD YOU THAT HE RETORTED
1274-121770-0031 IT'S NOT EVERY GIRL THAT WOULD CARE TO MARRY A KING'S SON
1274-121770-0032 AT ALL EVENTS THE PRINCE WAS NONE THE BETTER FOR IT BUT THE SONG SAYS SHE MADE A TENDER WIFE I OBJECTED SHE COULDN'T HELP HERSELF
1274-121770-0033 TURKEY I EXCLAIMED HE WAS A PRINCE I KNOW THAT THEN HE MUST HAVE BEEN A GENTLEMAN I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE READ OF A GOOD MANY PRINCES WHO DID THINGS I SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO DO
1274-121770-0034 IN THE LOW ENDEAVOUR TO BOLSTER UP THE WRONG WITH MY SILLY LOGIC NO THEREFORE IF I WERE TO DO WHAT WAS RUDE AND DISHONEST PEOPLE WOULD SAY WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT OF A PLOUGHBOY A PRINCE OUGHT TO BE JUST SO MUCH BETTER BRED THAN A PLOUGHBOY
1274-121770-0035 I WOULD SCORN TO DO WHAT THAT PRINCE DID WHAT'S WRONG IN A PLOUGHBOY CAN'T BE RIGHT IN A PRINCE RANALD OR ELSE RIGHT IS ONLY RIGHT SOMETIMES SO THAT RIGHT MAY BE WRONG AND WRONG MAY BE RIGHT
1274-121770-0036 WELL TURKEY YOU KNOW BEST I CAN'T HELP THINKING THE PRINCE WAS NOT SO MUCH TO BLAME THOUGH YOU SEE WHAT CAME OF IT MISERY PERHAPS HE WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD THE MISERY AND ALL TOGETHER THAN NONE OF IT
1274-121770-0037 THAT'S FOR HIM TO SETTLE BUT HE MUST HAVE SEEN HE WAS WRONG BEFORE HE HAD DONE WANDERING BY THE SEA LIKE THAT WELL NOW TURKEY
1274-121770-0038 I'M SUPPOSING YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AT FIRST SIGHT YOU KNOW I ADDED WELL I'M SURE I SHOULD NOT HAVE KEPT THE COMB EVEN IF I HAD TAKEN IT JUST TO GET A CHANCE OF SPEAKING TO HER
1274-121770-0039 SHE MIGHT HAVE COME AGAIN AND IF HE HAD MARRIED HER AT LAST OF HER OWN FREE WILL SHE WOULD NOT HAVE RUN AWAY FROM HIM
1274-121770-0040 BUT DID NOT SEE HER HOW BLANK AND DULL THE SCHOOLROOM SEEMED STILL SHE MIGHT ARRIVE ANY MOMENT BUT SHE DID NOT COME I WENT THROUGH MY DUTIES WEARILY HOPING EVER FOR THE HOUR OF RELEASE
1274-121770-0041 I COULD SEE WELL ENOUGH THAT TURKEY WAS ANXIOUS TOO THE MOMENT SCHOOL WAS OVER WE HURRIED AWAY ALMOST WITHOUT A WORD TO THE COTTAGE THERE WE FOUND HER WEEPING HER GRANDMOTHER HAD DIED SUDDENLY
1274-121770-0042 SHE CLUNG TO TURKEY AND SEEMED ALMOST TO FORGET MY PRESENCE BUT I THOUGHT NOTHING OF THAT HAD THE CASE BEEN MINE I TOO SHOULD HAVE CLUNG TO TURKEY FROM FAITH IN HIS HELP AND SUPERIOR WISDOM
1274-121770-0043 THERE WERE TWO OR THREE OLD WOMEN IN THE PLACE TURKEY WENT AND SPOKE TO THEM AND THEN TOOK ELSIE HOME TO HIS MOTHER JAMIE WAS ASLEEP AND THEY WOULD NOT WAKE HIM HOW IT WAS ARRANGED I FORGET
1274-121770-0044 THE COTTAGE WAS LET AND THE COW TAKEN HOME BY THEIR FATHER BEFORE SUMMER JAMIE HAD GOT A PLACE IN A SHOP IN THE VILLAGE
