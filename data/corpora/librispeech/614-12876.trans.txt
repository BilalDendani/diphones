614-12876-0000 GRACE WAS STILL WHERE SHE HAD FALLEN COOLING A LARGE RED LUMP ON HER FOREHEAD BY APPLYING HER HANDKERCHIEF FIRST TO THE ICE AND THEN TO THE SWOLLEN PLACE WHEN SHE SUDDENLY FELT HERSELF TO BE ENTIRELY ALONE IN THE WORLD EVERYBODY HAS GONE HOME TO DINNER SHE EXCLAIMED AS SHE GLANCED OVER HER SHOULDER AT THE OTHER END OF THE POND
614-12876-0001 NOW DENUDED OF SKATERS THEN SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION LOOKING FOR TOM AND JULIA SHE HAD NEVER DREAMED WHEN SHE SAW HER FRIEND GO WHIZZING ACROSS THE ICE THAT HE HAD NOT CAUGHT THE RECKLESS GIRL IN TIME TO WARN HER OF HER DANGER
614-12876-0002 TOM TOM GRAY SHE CALLED WHERE ARE YOU RUN FOR HELP CAME THE ANSWER IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE SAW THEM CLINGING TO A BROKEN LEDGE OF ICE TOM SUPPORTING JULIA CROSBY AS FOR THE JUNIOR CAPTAIN SHE WAS WEEPING BITTERLY AND MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO HELP HERSELF
614-12876-0003 GRACE ANXIOUSLY SCANNED THE EXPANSE OF THE ICE IT WAS NEARLY A MILE TO THE OTHER END OF THE POND AND THE LAST GROUP OF SKATERS HAD DISAPPEARED OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL
614-12876-0004 NOTHING BUT THE GREAT ICE HOUSE THAT STOOD LIKE A LONELY SENTINEL ON THE BANK YET SOMETHING SEEMED TO TELL HER THAT HELP LAY IN THAT DIRECTION ONCE BEFORE IN A MOMENT OF DANGER GRACE HAD OBEYED THIS SAME IMPULSE AND HAD NEVER REGRETTED IT
614-12876-0005 ONCE AGAIN SHE WAS FOLLOWING THE INSTINCT THAT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO ANOTHER PERSON ANYTHING BUT WISE SKATING AS SHE HAD NEVER SKATED BEFORE GRACE HARLOWE REACHED THE SHORE IN A MOMENT HERE DROPPING TO THE BANK SHE QUICKLY REMOVED HER SKATES
614-12876-0006 THEN RAN TOWARD THE ICE HOUSE FEELING STRANGELY UNACCUSTOMED TO WALKING ON THE GROUND AFTER HER LONG MORNING ON SKATES
614-12876-0007 SUPPOSE THERE IS NO ONE THERE SHE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN RAN ON FASTER THAN BEFORE I SHALL FIND HELP OVER THERE I KNOW I SHALL SHE THOUGHT AS SHE HURRIED OVER THE FROZEN GROUND AND MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE ICE HOUSE THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST
614-12876-0008 TOM AND JULIA WERE LIABLE TO BE SUCKED UNDER AND DROWNED WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HELP GRACE PUSHED RESOLUTELY ON IN THE MEANTIME HARDLY FOUR MINUTES HAD REALLY ELAPSED SINCE THE SKATERS HAD TUMBLED INTO THE WATER
614-12876-0009 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ICE HOUSE SHE CAME ABRUPTLY UPON A MAN ENGAGED IN LOADING A CHILD'S WAGON WITH CHIPS OF WOOD HELP CRIED GRACE HELP SOME PEOPLE HAVE BROKEN THROUGH THE ICE HAVE YOU A ROPE THE MAN MADE NO ANSWER WHATEVER HE DID NOT EVEN LOOK UP UNTIL GRACE SHOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDER
614-12876-0010 THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE SHE CRIED THEY MAY DROWN AT ANY MOMENT COME COME QUICKLY AND HELP ME SAVE THEM THE MAN LOOKED AT HER WITH A STRANGE FAR AWAY EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES
614-12876-0011 ARE YOU DEAF HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STUPIDLY TOUCHING HIS EARS AND MOUTH DEAF AND DUMB SHE EXCLAIMED IN DESPAIR HOLDING UP TWO FINGERS GRACE POINTED TOWARD THE WATER THEN SHE MADE A SWIMMING MOTION
614-12876-0012 PERHAPS HE HAD UNDERSTOOD SHE COULD NOT TELL BUT HER QUICK EYE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF A LONG THIN PLANK ON THE SHORE PULLING OFF ONE OF HER MITTENS SHE SHOWED HIM A LITTLE PEARL AND TURQUOISE RING HER MOTHER HAD GIVEN HER FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT
614-12876-0013 INDICATING THAT SHE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM IF HE WOULD HELP HER THEN SHE SEIZED ONE END OF THE PLANK AND MADE A SIGN FOR HIM TO TAKE THE OTHER BUT THE STUBBORN CREATURE BEGAN TO UNLOAD THE CHIPS FROM THE WAGON GRACE RAN BLINDLY AHEAD DRAGGING THE PLANK ALONE HE'S FEEBLE MINDED SHE QUIVERED
614-12876-0014 I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO WORK THIS THING BY MYSELF WHEN SHE HAD REACHED THE BANK GRACE HEARD HIM TROTTING BEHIND HER WITH HIS LITTLE WAGON IN ANOTHER MOMENT THERE WAS A TUG AT THE BOARD SHE TURNED AND SHOOK HER FIST ANGRILY AT HIM BUT WITHOUT REGARDING HER IN THE LEAST
614-12876-0015 HE LIFTED THE PLANK AND RESTED IT ON THE WAGON THEN MOTIONING HER TO HOLD UP THE BACK END HE STARTED ON A RUN DOWN THE BANK THE POOR SOUL THINKS HE'S A HORSE I SUPPOSE SHE SAID TO HERSELF BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF WE CAN ONLY GET THE PLANK TO TOM AND JULIA
614-12876-0016 GRACE SOON SAW HOWEVER THAT THE IDEA WAS NOT ENTIRELY IDIOTIC LATER SHE WAS TO OFFER UP A PRAYER OF THANKS FOR THAT SAME CHILD'S WAGON THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN WAS WEARING HEAVY ARCTIC RUBBERS WHICH KEPT HIM FROM SLIPPING WHILE GRACE WHOSE SOLES WERE AS SMOOTH AS GLASS
614-12876-0017 KEPT HER BALANCE ADMIRABLY BY MEANS OF THE OTHER END OF THE PLANK TOM AND JULIA CROSBY HAD NOW BEEN NEARLY TEN MINUTES IN THE WATER TWICE THE ICE HAD BROKEN UNDER TOM'S GRASP WHILE JULIA WHO SEEMED UNABLE TO HELP HERSELF HAD THROWN ALL HER WEIGHT ON THE POOR BOY
614-12876-0018 WHILE SHE CALLED WILDLY FOR HELP AND HEAPED GRACE WITH REPROACHES FOR RUNNING AWAY IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT WOULD BE THE ACT OF A COWARD EXCLAIMED TOM AT LAST HIS TEETH CHATTERING WITH COLD I WOULD LET GO OF YOUR ARM AND GIVE UP THE JOB OF SUPPORTING YOU IN THIS ICE WATER FOR TALKING ABOUT GRACE LIKE THAT
614-12876-0019 OF COURSE SHE HAS GONE FOR HELP HAVEN'T YOU FOUND OUT LONG AGO THAT SHE IS THE RIGHT SORT WELL WHY DID SHE GO IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SOBBED JULIA EVERYBODY IS OVER ON THE OTHER BANK THERE IS NOTHING BUT AN ICE HOUSE OVER HERE YOU MAY TRUST TO HER TO HAVE HAD SOME GOOD SENSIBLE REASON RETORTED TOM LOYALLY
614-12876-0020 I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP UP MUCH LONGER EXCLAIMED JULIA BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN KEEP ON CRYING REPLIED TOM EXASPERATED IT WILL WARM YOU AND REMEMBER THAT I AM DOING THE KEEPING UP I DON'T SEE THAT YOU ARE MAKING ANY SPECIAL EFFORT IN THAT DIRECTION
614-12876-0021 ONCE TOM HAD ENDEAVORED TO LIFT JULIA OUT OF THE HOLE AND HE BELIEVED AND ALWAYS INSISTED IN TELLING THE STORY AFTERWARDS THAT IF SHE HAD BEEN WILLING TO HELP HERSELF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BUT JULIA CROSBY TRIUMPHANT LEADER OF HER CLASS AND JULIA CROSBY COLD AND WET AS A RESULT OF HER OWN RECKLESSNESS
614-12876-0022 AND STILL SHIVERING VIOLENTLY KNELT BESIDE GRACE ON THE PLANK BUT IT WAS TOO SHORT WHEN TOM GRAY SEIZED ONE END OF IT HE NEARLY UPSET BOTH THE GIRLS INTO THE WATER OH WHAT SHALL WE DO CRIED GRACE IN DESPAIR WHEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME THE THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE WAGON
614-12876-0023 QUICKLY UNTWISTING A LONG MUFFLER OF RED SILK FROM ABOUT HER NECK GRACE TIED IT SECURELY IN THE MIDDLE AROUND THE CROSS PIECE OF THE TONGUE OF THE STOUT LITTLE VEHICLE THEN SHE PUSHED IT GENTLY UNTIL IT STOOD ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLE GIVING ONE END OF THE MUFFLER TO JULIA GRACE TOOK THE OTHER HERSELF
614-12876-0024 CATCH HOLD OF THE TAIL PIECE TOM SHE CRIED FORTUNATELY THE ICE WAS VERY ROUGH WHERE THE GIRLS WERE STANDING OR THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SLIPPED AND FALLEN
614-12876-0025 WITH TOM'S ADDITIONAL WEIGHT ON IT INSTEAD OF BREAKING BEGAN TO SINK BUT TOM GRAY WAS OUT OF THE HOLE NOW HELPED BY THE WAGON HE SLIPPED EASILY ALONG THE HALF SUBMERGED ICE
614-12876-0026 WHO HAD CERTAINLY BEEN BRAVE AND PATIENT DURING THE ORDEAL ALTHOUGH HE HAD UTTERED THE MOST FEARFUL SOUNDS AS SOON AS HIS FEET TOUCHED THE SOLID ICE HE SEIZED HIS WAGON AND MADE FOR THE BANK
614-12876-0027 HURRIED AFTER HIM BUT SHE WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE AND COULD NOT RUN BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE BANK HE HAD ROUNDED THE CORNER OF THE ICE HOUSE AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT
614-12876-0028 WE HAD BETTER GET HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OR WE'LL ALL BE LAID UP WITH COLDS THE THREE HALF FROZEN YOUNG PEOPLE MADE THEIR WAY HOME AS BEST THEY COULD THEIR CLOTHES HAD FROZEN STIFF MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HURRY
614-12876-0029 JULIA CROSBY SAID NOT A WORD DURING THE WALK BUT WHEN SHE LEFT THEM AT THE CORNER WHERE SHE TURNED INTO HER OWN STREET SHE SAID HUSKILY THANK YOU BOTH FOR WHAT YOU DID FOR ME TO DAY I OWE MY LIFE TO YOU THAT WAS A WHOLE LOT FOR HER TO SAY SAID GRACE
614-12876-0030 POINTING TO HIS WET CLOTHES I BELIEVE SHE WILL BE SAID GRACE SOFTLY AFTER ALL IT'S AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NO ONE GOOD
614-12876-0031 GRACE'S MOTHER WAS JUSTLY HORRIFIED WHEN GRACE IN HER BEDRAGGLED CONDITION WALKED INTO THE LIVING ROOM SHE INSISTED ON PUTTING HER TO BED WRAPPING HER IN BLANKETS AND GIVING HER HOT DRINKS GRACE FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP FROM WHICH SHE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL EVENING
614-12876-0032 THEN SHE ROSE DRESSED AND APPEARED AT THE SUPPER TABLE APPARENTLY NONE THE WORSE FOR HER WETTING MEANWHILE TOM GRAY HAD GONE TO HIS AUNT'S GIVEN HIMSELF A BRISK RUBBING DOWN
614-12876-0033 AND CHANGED HIS WET CLOTHING FOR ANOTHER SUIT HE FORTUNATELY HAPPENED TO HAVE WITH HIM THANKS TO HIS STRONG CONSTITUTION AND VIGOROUS HEALTH HE FELT NO BAD EFFECTS HE THEN WENT DOWN TO THE KITCHEN ASKED THE COOK FOR A CUP OF HOT COFFEE AND AFTER HASTILY SWALLOWING IT
614-12876-0034 RUSHED OFF TO FIND DAVID HIPPY AND REDDY AND TELL THEM THE NEWS HE WAS FILLED WITH ADMIRATION FOR GRACE SHE IS THE FINEST MOST RESOLUTE GIRL I EVER KNEW HE EXCLAIMED AS HE FINISHED HIS STORY HURRAH FOR GRACE HARLOWE SHOUTED REDDY LET'S GO DOWN TO NIGHT AND SEE IF SHE'S ALL RIGHT SUGGESTED DAVID
614-12876-0035 BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK THE FOUR BOYS WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE HARLOWE'S THEY CREPT QUIETLY UP TO THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW GRACE SAT BY THE FIRE READING VERY SOFTLY THEY BEGAN A POPULAR SONG THAT WAS A FAVORITE OF HERS GRACE'S QUICK EARS CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC
614-12876-0036 THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN WHO HELPED YOU OUT IS QUITE A CHARACTER SAID HIPPY I KNOW HIM WELL HE USED TO WORK FOR MY FATHER HE ISN'T HALF SO FOOLISH AS HE LOOKS EITHER
614-12876-0037 I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT IT WAS ONCE MINE IT MUST HAVE BEEN MADE ESPECIALLY STRONG OBSERVED REDDY IT WAS HICKORY AND IRON WERE THE MATERIALS USED I BELIEVE
614-12876-0038 AND ALSO SMASHED THREE BEFORE MY FATHER HAD THIS ONE MADE TO ORDER
