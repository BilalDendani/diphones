44-207-0006 YOUR BROTHER AND I WERE AGREEING THIS MORNING THAT THOUGH IT IS VASTLY WELL TO BE HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS WE WOULD NOT LIVE HERE FOR MILLIONS WE SOON FOUND OUT THAT OUR TASTES WERE EXACTLY ALIKE IN PREFERRING THE COUNTRY TO EVERY OTHER PLACE
44-207-0007 REALLY OUR OPINIONS WERE SO EXACTLY THE SAME IT WAS QUITE RIDICULOUS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE POINT IN WHICH WE DIFFERED I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD YOU ARE SUCH A SLY THING I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE MADE SOME DROLL REMARK OR OTHER ABOUT IT
44-207-0008 NO INDEED I SHOULD NOT OH YES YOU WOULD INDEED I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF

44-207-0011 ISABELLA SMILED INCREDULOUSLY AND TALKED THE REST OF THE EVENING TO JAMES CATHERINE'S RESOLUTION OF ENDEAVOURING TO MEET MISS TILNEY AGAIN CONTINUED IN FULL FORCE THE NEXT MORNING
44-207-0012 AND TILL THE USUAL MOMENT OF GOING TO THE PUMP ROOM SHE FELT SOME ALARM FROM THE DREAD OF A SECOND PREVENTION BUT NOTHING OF THAT KIND OCCURRED NO VISITORS APPEARED TO DELAY THEM AND THEY ALL THREE SET OFF IN GOOD TIME FOR THE PUMP ROOM
44-207-0013 WHERE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EVENTS AND CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE MISTER ALLEN AFTER DRINKING HIS GLASS OF WATER JOINED SOME GENTLEMEN TO TALK OVER THE POLITICS OF THE DAY AND COMPARE THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR NEWSPAPERS
44-207-0014 AND THE LADIES WALKED ABOUT TOGETHER NOTICING EVERY NEW FACE AND ALMOST EVERY NEW BONNET IN THE ROOM THE FEMALE PART OF THE THORPE FAMILY ATTENDED BY JAMES MORLAND APPEARED AMONG THE CROWD IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
44-207-0015 AND CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY TOOK HER USUAL PLACE BY THE SIDE OF HER FRIEND JAMES WHO WAS NOW IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE MAINTAINED A SIMILAR POSITION AND SEPARATING THEMSELVES FROM THE REST OF THEIR PARTY THEY WALKED IN THAT MANNER FOR SOME TIME
44-207-0016 TILL CATHERINE BEGAN TO DOUBT THE HAPPINESS OF A SITUATION WHICH CONFINING HER ENTIRELY TO HER FRIEND AND BROTHER GAVE HER VERY LITTLE SHARE IN THE NOTICE OF EITHER THEY WERE ALWAYS ENGAGED IN SOME SENTIMENTAL DISCUSSION OR LIVELY DISPUTE
44-207-0017 THAT THOUGH CATHERINE'S SUPPORTING OPINION WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY CALLED FOR BY ONE OR THE OTHER SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO GIVE ANY
44-207-0018 AT LENGTH HOWEVER SHE WAS EMPOWERED TO DISENGAGE HERSELF FROM HER FRIEND BY THE AVOWED NECESSITY OF SPEAKING TO MISS TILNEY WHOM SHE MOST JOYFULLY SAW JUST ENTERING THE ROOM WITH MISSUS HUGHES
44-207-0019 AND WHOM SHE INSTANTLY JOINED WITH A FIRMER DETERMINATION TO BE ACQUAINTED THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD COURAGE TO COMMAND HAD SHE NOT BEEN URGED BY THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE DAY BEFORE MISS TILNEY MET HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY
44-207-0020 RETURNED HER ADVANCES WITH EQUAL GOODWILL AND THEY CONTINUED TALKING TOGETHER AS LONG AS BOTH PARTIES REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND THOUGH IN ALL PROBABILITY NOT AN OBSERVATION WAS MADE
44-207-0021 NOR AN EXPRESSION USED BY EITHER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MADE AND USED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE UNDER THAT ROOF IN EVERY BATH SEASON
44-207-0022 HOW WELL YOUR BROTHER DANCES WAS AN ARTLESS EXCLAMATION OF CATHERINE'S TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH AT ONCE SURPRISED AND AMUSED HER COMPANION HENRY SHE REPLIED WITH A SMILE YES HE DOES DANCE VERY WELL
44-207-0023 HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT VERY ODD TO HEAR ME SAY I WAS ENGAGED THE OTHER EVENING WHEN HE SAW ME SITTING DOWN BUT I REALLY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHOLE DAY TO MISTER THORPE MISS TILNEY COULD ONLY BOW
44-207-0024 HOW SURPRISED I WAS TO SEE HIM AGAIN I FELT SO SURE OF HIS BEING QUITE GONE AWAY
44-207-0025 HE CAME ONLY TO ENGAGE LODGINGS FOR US
44-207-0026 WAS NOT THE YOUNG LADY HE DANCED WITH ON MONDAY A MISS SMITH YES AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS HUGHES I DARE SAY SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO DANCE DO YOU THINK HER PRETTY NOT VERY
44-207-0027 HE NEVER COMES TO THE PUMP ROOM I SUPPOSE YES SOMETIMES BUT HE HAS RID OUT THIS MORNING WITH MY FATHER MISSUS HUGHES NOW JOINED THEM AND ASKED MISS TILNEY IF SHE WAS READY TO GO
44-207-0028 I HOPE I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AGAIN SOON SAID CATHERINE SHALL YOU BE AT THE COTILLION BALL TOMORROW PERHAPS WE YES I THINK WE CERTAINLY SHALL I AM GLAD OF IT FOR WE SHALL ALL BE THERE
44-207-0029 THIS CIVILITY WAS DULY RETURNED AND THEY PARTED ON MISS TILNEY'S SIDE WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE'S FEELINGS AND ON CATHERINE'S WITHOUT THE SMALLEST CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING EXPLAINED THEM SHE WENT HOME VERY HAPPY
44-207-0030 THE MORNING HAD ANSWERED ALL HER HOPES AND THE EVENING OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS NOW THE OBJECT OF EXPECTATION THE FUTURE GOOD WHAT GOWN AND WHAT HEAD DRESS SHE SHOULD WEAR ON THE OCCASION BECAME HER CHIEF CONCERN
44-207-0031 SHE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IN IT DRESS IS AT ALL TIMES A FRIVOLOUS DISTINCTION AND EXCESSIVE SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT OFTEN DESTROYS ITS OWN AIM CATHERINE KNEW ALL THIS VERY WELL HER GREAT AUNT HAD READ HER A LECTURE ON THE SUBJECT ONLY THE CHRISTMAS BEFORE
44-207-0032 AND YET SHE LAY AWAKE TEN MINUTES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT DEBATING BETWEEN HER SPOTTED AND HER TAMBOURED MUSLIN AND NOTHING BUT THE SHORTNESS OF THE TIME PREVENTED HER BUYING A NEW ONE FOR THE EVENING THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT
44-207-0033 GREAT THOUGH NOT UNCOMMON FROM WHICH ONE OF THE OTHER SEX RATHER THAN HER OWN A BROTHER RATHER THAN A GREAT AUNT MIGHT HAVE WARNED HER
44-207-0034 WHAT IS COSTLY OR NEW IN THEIR ATTIRE HOW LITTLE IT IS BIASED BY THE TEXTURE OF THEIR MUSLIN AND HOW UNSUSCEPTIBLE OF PECULIAR TENDERNESS TOWARDS THE SPOTTED
44-207-0035 WOMAN IS FINE FOR HER OWN SATISFACTION ALONE NO MAN WILL ADMIRE HER THE MORE NO WOMAN WILL LIKE HER THE BETTER FOR IT
44-207-0036 NEATNESS AND FASHION ARE ENOUGH FOR THE FORMER AND A SOMETHING OF SHABBINESS OR IMPROPRIETY WILL BE MOST ENDEARING TO THE LATTER BUT NOT ONE OF THESE GRAVE REFLECTIONS TROUBLED THE TRANQUILLITY OF CATHERINE
44-207-0037 SHE ENTERED THE ROOMS ON THURSDAY EVENING WITH FEELINGS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAD ATTENDED HER THITHER THE MONDAY BEFORE
44-207-0038 AND WAS NOW CHIEFLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID HIS SIGHT LEST HE SHOULD ENGAGE HER AGAIN FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT DARED NOT EXPECT THAT MISTER TILNEY SHOULD ASK HER A THIRD TIME TO DANCE
44-207-0039 HER WISHES HOPES AND PLANS ALL CENTRED IN NOTHING LESS EVERY YOUNG LADY MAY FEEL FOR MY HEROINE IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT FOR EVERY YOUNG LADY HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THE SAME AGITATION
44-207-0040 ALL HAVE BEEN OR AT LEAST ALL HAVE BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE IN DANGER FROM THE PURSUIT OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY WISHED TO AVOID AND ALL HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY
44-207-0041 WISHED TO PLEASE AS SOON AS THEY WERE JOINED BY THE THORPES CATHERINE'S AGONY BEGAN SHE FIDGETED ABOUT IF JOHN THORPE CAME TOWARDS HER HID HERSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM HIS VIEW AND WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR HIM
44-207-0042 THE COTILLIONS WERE OVER THE COUNTRY DANCING BEGINNING AND SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE TILNEYS DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED MY DEAR CATHERINE WHISPERED ISABELLA BUT I AM REALLY GOING TO DANCE WITH YOUR BROTHER AGAIN
44-207-0043 I DECLARE POSITIVELY IT IS QUITE SHOCKING I TELL HIM HE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF BUT YOU AND JOHN MUST KEEP US IN COUNTENANCE MAKE HASTE MY DEAR CREATURE AND COME TO US JOHN IS JUST WALKED OFF BUT HE WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT
44-207-0044 CATHERINE HAD NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO ANSWER THE OTHERS WALKED AWAY JOHN THORPE WAS STILL IN VIEW AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP FOR LOST THAT SHE MIGHT NOT APPEAR HOWEVER TO OBSERVE OR EXPECT HIM
44-207-0045 SHE KEPT HER EYES INTENTLY FIXED ON HER FAN AND A SELF CONDEMNATION FOR HER FOLLY IN SUPPOSING THAT AMONG SUCH A CROWD THEY SHOULD EVEN MEET WITH THE TILNEYS IN ANY REASONABLE TIME HAD JUST PASSED THROUGH HER MIND WHEN SHE SUDDENLY FOUND HERSELF ADDRESSED
44-207-0046 AND AGAIN SOLICITED TO DANCE BY MISTER TILNEY HIMSELF WITH WHAT SPARKLING EYES AND READY MOTION SHE GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND WITH HOW PLEASING A FLUTTER OF HEART SHE WENT WITH HIM TO THE SET MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED
44-207-0047 TO ESCAPE AND AS SHE BELIEVED SO NARROWLY ESCAPE JOHN THORPE AND TO BE ASKED SO IMMEDIATELY ON HIS JOINING HER ASKED BY MISTER TILNEY AS IF HE HAD SOUGHT HER ON PURPOSE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HER THAT LIFE COULD SUPPLY ANY GREATER FELICITY
44-207-0048 TILNEY HE REPEATED HUM I DO NOT KNOW HIM A GOOD FIGURE OF A MAN WELL PUT TOGETHER
44-207-0049 A FAMOUS CLEVER ANIMAL FOR THE ROAD ONLY FORTY GUINEAS I HAD FIFTY MINDS TO BUY IT MYSELF
44-207-0050 BUT IT WOULD NOT ANSWER MY PURPOSE IT WOULD NOT DO FOR THE FIELD I WOULD GIVE ANY MONEY FOR A REAL GOOD HUNTER I HAVE THREE NOW THE BEST THAT EVER WERE BACKED I WOULD NOT TAKE EIGHT HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR THEM
44-207-0051 THIS WAS THE LAST SENTENCE BY WHICH HE COULD WEARY CATHERINE'S ATTENTION FOR HE WAS JUST THEN BORNE OFF BY THE RESISTLESS PRESSURE OF A LONG STRING OF PASSING LADIES HER PARTNER NOW DREW NEAR AND SAID
44-207-0052 THAT GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVE PUT ME OUT OF PATIENCE HAD HE STAYED WITH YOU HALF A MINUTE LONGER HE HAS NO BUSINESS TO WITHDRAW THE ATTENTION OF MY PARTNER FROM ME WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT OF MUTUAL AGREEABLENESS FOR THE SPACE OF AN EVENING
44-207-0053 AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE
44-207-0054 FIDELITY AND COMPLAISANCE ARE THE PRINCIPAL DUTIES OF BOTH AND THOSE MEN WHO DO NOT CHOOSE TO DANCE OR MARRY THEMSELVES HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THE PARTNERS OR WIVES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THEY ARE SUCH VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
44-207-0055 THAT YOU THINK THEY CANNOT BE COMPARED TOGETHER TO BE SURE NOT PEOPLE THAT MARRY CAN NEVER PART BUT MUST GO AND KEEP HOUSE TOGETHER PEOPLE THAT DANCE ONLY STAND OPPOSITE EACH OTHER IN A LONG ROOM FOR HALF AN HOUR
44-207-0056 AND SUCH IS YOUR DEFINITION OF MATRIMONY AND DANCING TAKEN IN THAT LIGHT CERTAINLY THEIR RESEMBLANCE IS NOT STRIKING BUT I THINK I COULD PLACE THEM IN SUCH A VIEW YOU WILL ALLOW THAT IN BOTH MAN HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF CHOICE WOMAN ONLY THE POWER OF REFUSAL
44-207-0057 THAT IN BOTH IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN FORMED FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF EACH AND THAT WHEN ONCE ENTERED INTO THEY BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO EACH OTHER TILL THE MOMENT OF ITS DISSOLUTION THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY
44-207-0058 EACH TO ENDEAVOUR TO GIVE THE OTHER NO CAUSE FOR WISHING THAT HE OR SHE HAD BESTOWED THEMSELVES ELSEWHERE AND THEIR BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THEIR OWN IMAGINATIONS FROM WANDERING TOWARDS THE PERFECTIONS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS
44-207-0059 YOU WILL ALLOW ALL THIS YES TO BE SURE AS YOU STATE IT ALL THIS SOUNDS VERY WELL BUT STILL THEY ARE SO VERY DIFFERENT I CANNOT LOOK UPON THEM AT ALL IN THE SAME LIGHT NOR THINK THE SAME DUTIES BELONG TO THEM IN ONE RESPECT THERE CERTAINLY IS A DIFFERENCE
44-207-0060 IN MARRIAGE THE MAN IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN TO MAKE THE HOME AGREEABLE TO THE MAN HE IS TO PURVEY AND SHE IS TO SMILE BUT IN DANCING THEIR DUTIES ARE EXACTLY CHANGED
44-207-0061 THE AGREEABLENESS THE COMPLIANCE ARE EXPECTED FROM HIM WHILE SHE FURNISHES THE FAN AND THE LAVENDER WATER THAT I SUPPOSE WAS THE DIFFERENCE OF DUTIES WHICH STRUCK YOU AS RENDERING THE CONDITIONS INCAPABLE OF COMPARISON
44-207-0062 NO INDEED I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEN I AM QUITE AT A LOSS ONE THING HOWEVER I MUST OBSERVE THIS DISPOSITION ON YOUR SIDE IS RATHER ALARMING
44-207-0063 YOU TOTALLY DISALLOW ANY SIMILARITY IN THE OBLIGATIONS AND MAY I NOT THENCE INFER THAT YOUR NOTIONS OF THE DUTIES OF THE DANCING STATE ARE NOT SO STRICT AS YOUR PARTNER MIGHT WISH HAVE I NOT REASON TO FEAR THAT IF THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE TO YOU JUST NOW WERE TO RETURN
44-207-0064 MISTER THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S THAT IF HE TALKS TO ME I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY ALAS ALAS
44-207-0065 FOR IF I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TALK TO THEM AND BESIDES I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A SECURITY WORTH HAVING AND I SHALL PROCEED WITH COURAGE
44-207-0066 DO YOU FIND BATH AS AGREEABLE AS WHEN I HAD THE HONOUR OF MAKING THE INQUIRY BEFORE YES QUITE MORE SO INDEED MORE SO TAKE CARE OR YOU WILL FORGET TO BE TIRED OF IT AT THE PROPER TIME YOU OUGHT TO BE TIRED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS
44-207-0067 I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE TIRED IF I WERE TO STAY HERE SIX MONTHS BATH COMPARED WITH LONDON HAS LITTLE VARIETY AND SO EVERYBODY FINDS OUT EVERY YEAR FOR SIX WEEKS I ALLOW BATH IS PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT BEYOND THAT IT IS THE MOST TIRESOME PLACE IN THE WORLD
44-207-0068 WELL OTHER PEOPLE MUST JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE WHO GO TO LONDON MAY THINK NOTHING OF BATH BUT I WHO LIVE IN A SMALL RETIRED VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY CAN NEVER FIND GREATER SAMENESS IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAN IN MY OWN HOME
44-207-0069 WHICH I CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THERE YOU ARE NOT FOND OF THE COUNTRY YES I AM I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED THERE AND ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY
44-207-0070 ONE DAY IN THE COUNTRY IS EXACTLY LIKE ANOTHER BUT THEN YOU SPEND YOUR TIME SO MUCH MORE RATIONALLY IN THE COUNTRY DO I DO YOU NOT I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH DIFFERENCE HERE YOU ARE IN PURSUIT ONLY OF AMUSEMENT ALL DAY LONG
44-207-0071 AND SO I AM AT HOME ONLY I DO NOT FIND SO MUCH OF IT I WALK ABOUT HERE AND SO I DO THERE BUT HERE I SEE A VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN EVERY STREET AND THERE I CAN ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN
44-207-0072 MISTER TILNEY WAS VERY MUCH AMUSED ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN HE REPEATED WHAT A PICTURE OF INTELLECTUAL POVERTY HOWEVER WHEN YOU SINK INTO THIS ABYSS AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY
44-207-0073 OH YES I SHALL NEVER BE IN WANT OF SOMETHING TO TALK OF AGAIN TO MISSUS ALLEN OR ANYBODY ELSE I REALLY BELIEVE I SHALL ALWAYS BE TALKING OF BATH WHEN I AM AT HOME AGAIN
44-207-0074 I DO LIKE IT SO VERY MUCH IF I COULD BUT HAVE PAPA AND MAMMA AND THE REST OF THEM HERE I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE TOO HAPPY JAMES'S COMING MY ELDEST BROTHER IS QUITE DELIGHTFUL
44-207-0075 AND ESPECIALLY AS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE VERY FAMILY WE ARE JUST GOT SO INTIMATE WITH ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS ALREADY OH WHO CAN EVER BE TIRED OF BATH NOT THOSE WHO BRING SUCH FRESH FEELINGS OF EVERY SORT TO IT AS YOU DO
44-207-0076 AND THE HONEST RELISH OF BALLS AND PLAYS AND EVERYDAY SIGHTS IS PAST WITH THEM HERE THEIR CONVERSATION CLOSED THE DEMANDS OF THE DANCE BECOMING NOW TOO IMPORTUNATE FOR A DIVIDED ATTENTION
44-207-0077 SOON AFTER THEIR REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE SET CATHERINE PERCEIVED HERSELF TO BE EARNESTLY REGARDED BY A GENTLEMAN WHO STOOD AMONG THE LOOKERS ON IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER PARTNER
44-207-0078 OF A COMMANDING ASPECT PAST THE BLOOM BUT NOT PAST THE VIGOUR OF LIFE AND WITH HIS EYE STILL DIRECTED TOWARDS HER SHE SAW HIM PRESENTLY ADDRESS MISTER TILNEY IN A FAMILIAR WHISPER
44-207-0079 CONFUSED BY HIS NOTICE AND BLUSHING FROM THE FEAR OF ITS BEING EXCITED BY SOMETHING WRONG IN HER APPEARANCE SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
44-207-0080 I SEE THAT YOU GUESS WHAT I HAVE JUST BEEN ASKED THAT GENTLEMAN KNOWS YOUR NAME AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW HIS IT IS GENERAL TILNEY MY FATHER CATHERINE'S ANSWER WAS ONLY OH BUT IT WAS AN OH EXPRESSING EVERYTHING NEEDFUL
44-207-0081 ATTENTION TO HIS WORDS AND PERFECT RELIANCE ON THEIR TRUTH WITH REAL INTEREST AND STRONG ADMIRATION DID HER EYE NOW FOLLOW THE GENERAL AS HE MOVED THROUGH THE CROWD AND HOW HANDSOME A FAMILY THEY ARE WAS HER SECRET REMARK
44-207-0082 IN CHATTING WITH MISS TILNEY BEFORE THE EVENING CONCLUDED A NEW SOURCE OF FELICITY AROSE TO HER SHE HAD NEVER TAKEN A COUNTRY WALK SINCE HER ARRIVAL IN BATH MISS TILNEY TO WHOM ALL THE COMMONLY FREQUENTED ENVIRONS WERE FAMILIAR
44-207-0083 SPOKE OF THEM IN TERMS WHICH MADE HER ALL EAGERNESS TO KNOW THEM TOO AND ON HER OPENLY FEARING THAT SHE MIGHT FIND NOBODY TO GO WITH HER IT WAS PROPOSED BY THE BROTHER AND SISTER THAT THEY SHOULD JOIN IN A WALK SOME MORNING OR OTHER I SHALL LIKE IT SHE CRIED
44-207-0084 AND DO NOT LET US PUT IT OFF LET US GO TOMORROW THIS WAS READILY AGREED TO WITH ONLY A PROVISO OF MISS TILNEY'S THAT IT DID NOT RAIN WHICH CATHERINE WAS SURE IT WOULD NOT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THEY WERE TO CALL FOR HER IN PULTENEY STREET AND REMEMBER
44-207-0085 TWELVE O'CLOCK WAS HER PARTING SPEECH TO HER NEW FRIEND OF HER OTHER HER OLDER HER MORE ESTABLISHED FRIEND ISABELLA OF WHOSE FIDELITY AND WORTH SHE HAD ENJOYED A FORTNIGHT'S EXPERIENCE SHE SCARCELY SAW ANYTHING DURING THE EVENING
