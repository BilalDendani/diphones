5712-48848-0000 AND AFTER DINNER MISSUS DALE WENT THROUGH THE GARDENS UP TO THE OTHER HOUSE WITH A WRITTEN NOTE IN HER HAND IN THAT NOTE SHE HAD TOLD LADY JULIA WITH MANY PROTESTATIONS OF GRATITUDE
5712-48848-0001 THAT LILY WAS UNABLE TO GO OUT SO SOON AFTER HER ILLNESS AND THAT SHE HERSELF WAS OBLIGED TO STAY WITH LILY SHE EXPLAINED ALSO THAT THE BUSINESS OF MOVING WAS IN HAND AND THAT THEREFORE SHE COULD NOT HERSELF ACCEPT THE INVITATION
5712-48848-0002 AS HE REPEATED THE WORDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THERE WAS AN EAGERNESS IN HIS VOICE THAT FILLED MISSUS DALE'S HEART WITH TENDERNESS TOWARDS HIM THE TRUTH IS SAID MISSUS DALE SHE COULD NOT GO THERE TO MEET JOHN EAMES
5712-48848-0003 THE VERY REASONS WHICH SHOULD MAKE US INDUCE HER TO GO THERE IF WE CAN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER TELL YOU ALL LORD DE GUEST HAS TAKEN HIM BY THE HAND AND WISHES HIM TO MARRY HE HAS PROMISED TO SETTLE ON HIM AN INCOME WHICH WILL MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE FOR LIFE
5712-48848-0004 THAT IS VERY GENEROUS AND I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT FOR JOHN'S SAKE AND THEY HAVE PROMOTED HIM AT HIS OFFICE AH THEN HE WILL DO WELL HE WILL DO VERY WELL HE IS PRIVATE SECRETARY NOW TO THEIR HEAD MAN
5712-48848-0005 AND MARY SO THAT SHE LILY SHOULD NOT BE EMPTY HANDED IF THIS MARRIAGE CAN BE ARRANGED I HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO SETTLE A HUNDRED A YEAR ON HER ON HER AND HER CHILDREN IF SHE WILL ACCEPT HIM NOW YOU KNOW IT ALL I DID NOT MEAN TO TELL YOU
5712-48848-0006 BUT IT IS AS WELL THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE MEANS OF JUDGING THAT OTHER MAN WAS A VILLAIN THIS MAN IS HONEST WOULD IT NOT BE WELL THAT SHE SHOULD LEARN TO LIKE HIM SHE ALWAYS DID LIKE HIM I THOUGHT BEFORE THAT OTHER FELLOW CAME DOWN HERE AMONG US
5712-48848-0007 IT WOULD BE A HEALING OF WOUNDS MOST DESIRABLE AND SALUTARY AN ARRANGEMENT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEM ALL A DESTINY FOR LILY MOST DEVOUTLY TO BE DESIRED IF ONLY IT WERE POSSIBLE
5712-48848-0008 MISSUS DALE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT IF HER DAUGHTER COULD BE MADE TO ACCEPT JOHN EAMES AS HER SECOND LOVER IN A YEAR OR TWO ALL WOULD BE WELL CROSBIE WOULD THEN BE FORGOTTEN OR THOUGHT OF WITHOUT REGRET AND LILY WOULD BECOME THE MISTRESS OF A HAPPY HOME
5712-48848-0009 BUT THERE ARE POSITIONS WHICH CANNOT BE REACHED THOUGH THERE BE NO PHYSICAL OR MATERIAL OBJECTION IN THE WAY IT IS THE VIEW WHICH THE MIND TAKES OF A THING WHICH CREATES THE SORROW THAT ARISES FROM IT IF THE HEART WERE ALWAYS MALLEABLE AND THE FEELINGS COULD BE CONTROLLED
5712-48848-0010 WHO WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE TORMENTED BY ANY OF THE REVERSES WHICH AFFECTION MEETS DEATH WOULD CREATE NO SORROW INGRATITUDE WOULD LOSE ITS STING AND THE BETRAYAL OF LOVE WOULD DO NO INJURY BEYOND THAT WHICH IT MIGHT ENTAIL UPON WORLDLY CIRCUMSTANCES
5712-48848-0011 SIX MONTHS PLEADED THE SQUIRE IT WILL TAKE YEARS NOT MONTHS SAID MISSUS DALE AND SHE WILL LOSE ALL HER YOUTH YES
5712-48848-0012 BUT IT IS DONE AND WE CANNOT NOW GO BACK SHE LOVES HIM YET AS DEARLY AS SHE EVER LOVED HIM THEN THE SQUIRE MUTTERED CERTAIN WORDS BELOW HIS BREATH EJACULATIONS AGAINST CROSBIE WHICH WERE HARDLY VOLUNTARY
5712-48848-0013 BUT EVEN AS INVOLUNTARY EJACULATIONS WERE VERY IMPROPER MISSUS DALE HEARD THEM AND WAS NOT OFFENDED EITHER BY THEIR IMPROPRIETY OR THEIR WARMTH BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SHE SAID THAT SHE CANNOT BRING HERSELF TO GO THERE
5712-48848-0014 THE SQUIRE STRUCK THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST AND REPEATED HIS EJACULATIONS IF HE COULD ONLY HAVE KNOWN HOW VERY DISAGREEABLE LADY ALEXANDRINA WAS MAKING HERSELF HIS SPIRIT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN LESS VEHEMENTLY DISTURBED
5712-48848-0015 THOSE WHO OFFEND US ARE GENERALLY PUNISHED FOR THE OFFENCE THEY GIVE BUT WE SO FREQUENTLY MISS THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT WE ARE AVENGED
5712-48848-0016 IT IS ARRANGED APPARENTLY THAT THE INJURER SHALL BE PUNISHED BUT THAT THE PERSON INJURED SHALL NOT GRATIFY HIS DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE AND WILL YOU GO TO GUESTWICK YOURSELF ASKED MISSUS DALE I WILL TAKE THE NOTE SAID THE SQUIRE
5712-48848-0017 AND WILL LET YOU KNOW TO MORROW THE EARL HAS BEHAVED SO KINDLY THAT EVERY POSSIBLE CONSIDERATION IS DUE TO HIM I HAD BETTER TELL HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH AND GO OR STAY AS HE MAY WISH I DON'T SEE THE GOOD OF GOING WHAT AM I TO DO AT GUESTWICK MANOR
5712-48848-0018 MISSUS DALE GOT UP TO LEAVE HIM BUT SHE COULD NOT GO WITHOUT SAYING SOME WORD OF GRATITUDE FOR ALL THAT HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO DO FOR THEM SHE WELL KNEW WHAT HE MEANT BY THE CURING OF DIFFICULTIES HE HAD INTENDED TO SIGNIFY THAT
5712-48848-0019 SHE FELT HALF ASHAMED OF WHAT SHE WAS DOING ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGING TO HERSELF THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BORNE WITH HIS STERNNESS IN RETURN FOR THE BENEFITS HE HAD DONE TO HER DAUGHTERS HAD SHE NOT FEARED THEIR REPROACHES SHE WOULD EVEN NOW HAVE GIVEN WAY
5712-48848-0020 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY TO YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS SAY NOTHING EITHER FOR MY KINDNESS OR UNKINDNESS
5712-48848-0021 STRIVING TO THINK GOOD AND NOT EVIL THESE WERE KIND LOVING WORDS SHOWING IN THEMSELVES A SPIRIT OF LOVE AND FORBEARANCE BUT THEY WERE SPOKEN IN A HARSH UNSYMPATHIZING VOICE AND THE SPEAKER AS HE UTTERED THEM LOOKED GLOOMILY AT THE FIRE
5712-48848-0022 THE WAY FROM THE LAWN INTO THE HOUSE THROUGH THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW WAS NOT AS YET OPEN AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO GO ROUND BY THE KITCHEN GARDEN ON TO THE ROAD AND THENCE IN BY THE FRONT DOOR OR ELSE TO PASS THROUGH THE BACK DOOR AND INTO THE HOUSE BY THE KITCHEN
5712-48848-0023 THERE WAS A SMILE UPON LILY'S FACE AS SHE LIFTED UP HER FINGER AS IF IN CAUTION AND NO ONE LOOKING AT HER WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT SHE WAS HERSELF IN TROUBLE MAMMA SHE SAID POINTING TO THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND SPEAKING ALMOST IN A WHISPER
5712-48848-0024 YOU MUST NOT GO IN THERE COME INTO THE PARLOUR WHO'S THERE WHERE'S BELL AND MISSUS DALE WENT INTO THE PARLOUR AS SHE WAS BIDDEN BUT WHO IS THERE SHE REPEATED HE'S THERE WHO IS HE
5712-48848-0025 OH MAMMA DON'T BE A GOOSE DOCTOR CROFTS IS THERE OF COURSE HE'S BEEN NEARLY AN HOUR I WONDER HOW HE IS MANAGING FOR THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH TO SIT UPON BUT THE OLD LUMP OF A CARPET THE ROOM IS STREWED ABOUT WITH CROCKERY AND BELL IS SUCH A FIGURE
5712-48848-0026 SHE HAS GOT ON YOUR OLD CHECKED APRON AND WHEN HE CAME IN SHE WAS ROLLING UP THE FIRE IRONS IN BROWN PAPER I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE WAS EVER IN SUCH A MESS BEFORE THERE'S ONE THING CERTAIN HE CAN'T KISS HER HAND IT'S YOU ARE THE GOOSE LILY
5712-48848-0027 BUT HE'S IN THERE CERTAINLY UNLESS HE HAS GONE OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW OR UP THE CHIMNEY WHAT MADE YOU LEAVE THEM HE MET ME HERE IN THE PASSAGE AND SPOKE TO ME EVER SO SERIOUSLY COME IN I SAID AND SEE BELL PACKING THE POKERS AND TONGS
5712-48848-0028 I WILL GO IN HE SAID BUT DON'T COME WITH ME HE WAS EVER SO SERIOUS AND I'M SURE HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF IT ALL THE WAY ALONG AND WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE SERIOUS OH NO OF COURSE HE OUGHT TO BE SERIOUS BUT ARE YOU NOT GLAD MAMMA
5712-48848-0029 I AM SO GLAD WE SHALL LIVE ALONE TOGETHER YOU AND I BUT SHE WILL BE SO CLOSE TO US MY BELIEF IS THAT HE'LL STAY THERE FOR EVER UNLESS SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN SO TIRED OF WAITING AND LOOKING OUT FOR YOU PERHAPS HE'S HELPING HER TO PACK THE THINGS
5712-48848-0030 DON'T YOU THINK WE MIGHT GO IN OR WOULD IT BE ILL NATURED LILY DON'T BE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO SAY ANYTHING YOU MAY BE MISTAKEN YOU KNOW AND THERE'S MANY A SLIP BETWEEN THE CUP AND THE LIP YES MAMMA THERE IS SAID LILY
5712-48848-0031 PUTTING HER HAND INSIDE HER MOTHER'S ARM THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH OH MY DARLING FORGIVE ME SAID THE MOTHER SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT THE USE OF THE OLD PROVERB AT THE PRESENT MOMENT HAD BEEN ALMOST CRUEL DO NOT MIND IT SAID LILY
5712-48848-0032 IT DOES NOT HURT ME IT DOES ME GOOD THAT IS TO SAY WHEN THERE IS NOBODY BY EXCEPT YOURSELF BUT WITH GOD'S HELP THERE SHALL BE NO SLIP HERE AND SHE SHALL BE HAPPY IT IS ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE THING DONE IN A HURRY
5712-48848-0033 BUT THEY'LL REMAIN THERE FOR EVER IF WE DON'T GO IN COME MAMMA YOU OPEN THE DOOR THEN MISSUS DALE DID OPEN THE DOOR GIVING SOME LITTLE PREMONITORY NOTICE WITH THE HANDLE SO THAT THE COUPLE INSIDE MIGHT BE WARNED OF APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
5712-48848-0034 CROFTS HAD NOT ESCAPED EITHER THROUGH THE WINDOW OR UP THE CHIMNEY BUT WAS SEATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ON AN EMPTY BOX JUST OPPOSITE TO BELL WHO WAS SEATED UPON THE LUMP OF CARPETING BELL STILL WORE THE CHECKED APRON AS DESCRIBED BY HER SISTER
5712-48848-0035 MISSUS DALE SAID THE DOCTOR BELL HAS CONSENTED THAT IT SHALL BE SO IF YOU WILL CONSENT THERE IS BUT LITTLE DOUBT OF THAT SAID MISSUS DALE WE SHALL NOT BE RICH BEGAN THE DOCTOR I HATE TO BE RICH SAID BELL
5712-48848-0036 CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF IT THAT A YOUNG LADY ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE OF GREAT BEAUTY AND KNOWN TO BE OF GOOD BIRTH HAD ON THE OCCASION BEEN ASKED AND GIVEN IN MARRIAGE WAS CARRIED ON AFTER A SOMEWHAT HUMDRUM FASHION AND IN A MANNER THAT MUST BE CALLED COMMONPLACE
5712-48848-0037 HOW DIFFERENT HAD IT BEEN WHEN CROSBIE HAD MADE HIS OFFER LILY FOR THE TIME HAD BEEN RAISED TO A PINNACLE A PINNACLE WHICH MIGHT BE DANGEROUS BUT WHICH WAS AT ANY RATE LOFTY WITH WHAT A PRETTY SPEECH HAD CROSBIE BEEN GREETED
5712-48848-0038 HOW IT HAD BEEN FELT BY ALL CONCERNED THAT THE FORTUNES OF THE SMALL HOUSE WERE IN THE ASCENDANT FELT INDEED WITH SOME TREPIDATION BUT STILL WITH MUCH INWARD TRIUMPH HOW GREAT HAD BEEN THE OCCASION FORCING LILY ALMOST TO LOSE HERSELF IN WONDERMENT AT WHAT HAD OCCURRED
5712-48848-0039 THERE WAS NO GREAT OCCASION NOW AND NO WONDERMENT NO ONE UNLESS IT WAS CROFTS FELT VERY TRIUMPHANT BUT THEY WERE ALL VERY HAPPY AND WERE SURE THAT THERE WAS SAFETY IN THEIR HAPPINESS
5712-48848-0040 IT WAS BUT THE OTHER DAY THAT ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN THROWN RUDELY TO THE GROUND THROUGH THE TREACHERY OF A LOVER BUT YET NONE OF THEM FEARED TREACHERY FROM THIS LOVER BELL WAS AS SURE OF HER LOT IN LIFE AS THOUGH SHE WERE ALREADY BEING TAKEN HOME TO HER MODEST HOUSE IN GUESTWICK
5712-48848-0041 BUT BELL WAS NOT SEATED NEXT TO HER LOVER
5712-48848-0042 SHE HAD BEEN IN NO WISE ASHAMED OF HER LOVE AND HAD SHOWN IT CONSTANTLY BY SOME LITTLE CARESSING MOTION OF HER HAND LEANING ON HIS ARM LOOKING INTO HIS FACE AS THOUGH SHE WERE CONTINUALLY DESIROUS OF SOME PALPABLE ASSURANCE OF HIS PRESENCE
5712-48848-0043 IT WAS NOT SO AT ALL WITH BELL SHE WAS HAPPY IN LOVING AND IN BEING LOVED BUT SHE REQUIRED NO OVERT TESTIMONIES OF AFFECTION I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD HAVE MADE HER UNHAPPY IF SOME SUDDEN NEED HAD REQUIRED THAT CROFTS SHOULD GO TO INDIA AND BACK BEFORE THEY WERE MARRIED
5712-48848-0044 THE THING WAS SETTLED AND THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR HER BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE EXPEDIENCY OF AN IMMEDIATE MARRIAGE SHE RAISED NO DIFFICULTY AS HER MOTHER WAS ABOUT TO GO INTO A NEW RESIDENCE
5712-48848-0045 IT MIGHT BE AS WELL THAT THAT RESIDENCE SHOULD BE FITTED TO THE WANTS OF TWO PERSONS INSTEAD OF THREE SO THEY TALKED ABOUT CHAIRS AND TABLES CARPETS AND KITCHENS IN A MOST UNROMANTIC HOMELY USEFUL MANNER
5712-48848-0046 THERE WAS THEREFORE A QUESTION OF BUYING NEW FURNITURE FOR A HOUSE IN GUESTWICK
5712-48848-0047 IN THE FIRST MONTH OR TWO THEY WERE TO LIVE IN LODGINGS AND THEIR GOODS WERE TO BE STORED IN SOME FRIENDLY WAREHOUSE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD IT NOT BE WELL
5712-48848-0048 THAT BELL'S MARRIAGE SHOULD BE SO ARRANGED THAT THE LODGING QUESTION MIGHT NOT BE IN ANY DEGREE COMPLICATED BY HER NECESSITIES THIS WAS THE LAST SUGGESTION MADE BY DOCTOR CROFTS INDUCED NO DOUBT BY THE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT HE HAD RECEIVED
5712-48848-0049 THAT WOULD BE HARDLY POSSIBLE SAID MISSUS DALE IT ONLY WANTS THREE WEEKS AND WITH THE HOUSE IN SUCH A CONDITION JAMES IS JOKING SAID BELL I WAS NOT JOKING AT ALL SAID THE DOCTOR
5712-48848-0050 WHY NOT SEND FOR MISTER BOYCE AND CARRY HER OFF AT ONCE ON A PILLION BEHIND YOU SAID LILY IT'S JUST THE SORT OF THING FOR PRIMITIVE PEOPLE TO DO LIKE YOU AND BELL ALL THE SAME BELL I DO WISH YOU COULD HAVE BEEN MARRIED FROM THIS HOUSE
5712-48848-0051 I SHALL ALWAYS CALL YOU DAME COMMONPLACE WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED SAID LILY THEN THEY HAD TEA AND AFTER TEA DOCTOR CROFTS GOT ON HIS HORSE AND RODE BACK TO GUESTWICK NOW MAY I TALK ABOUT HIM SAID LILY AS SOON AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HIS BACK
5712-48848-0052 NO YOU MAY NOT AS IF I HADN'T KNOWN IT ALL ALONG AND WASN'T IT HARD TO BEAR THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SCOLDED ME WITH SUCH PERTINACIOUS AUSTERITY
5712-48848-0053 I DON'T REMEMBER THE AUSTERITY SAID MISSUS DALE NOR YET LILY'S SILENCE SAID BELL BUT IT'S ALL SETTLED NOW SAID LILY AND I'M DOWNRIGHT HAPPY I NEVER FELT MORE SATISFACTION NEVER BELL NOR DID I SAID HER MOTHER
