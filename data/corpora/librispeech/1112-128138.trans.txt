1112-128138-0000 MISTER IAN HAMILTON'S BALLAD OF HADJI IS UNDENIABLY CLEVER HADJI IS A WONDERFUL ARAB HORSE THAT A RECKLESS HUNTER RIDES TO DEATH IN THE PURSUIT OF A WILD BOAR AND THE MORAL OF THE POEM FOR THERE IS A MORAL
1112-128138-0001 SEEMS TO BE THAT AN ABSORBING PASSION IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING AND BLUNTS THE HUMAN SYMPATHIES IN THE COURSE OF THE CHASE A LITTLE CHILD IS DROWNED A BRAHMIN MAIDEN MURDERED AND AN AGED PEASANT SEVERELY WOUNDED
1112-128138-0002 SOME OF THE STANZAS ARE VERY GRACEFUL NOTABLY ONE BEGINNING YES LIKE A BUBBLE FILLED WITH SMOKE THE CURD WHITE MOON UPSWIMMING BROKE THE VACANCY OF SPACE
1112-128138-0003 BUT SUCH LINES AS THE FOLLOWING WHICH OCCUR IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGHT WITH THE BOAR I HUNG AS CLOSE AS KEEPSAKE LOCKET ON MAIDEN BREAST BUT FROM ITS SOCKET HE WRENCHED MY BRIDLE ARM
1112-128138-0004 ARE DREADFUL AND HIS BRAINS FESTOONED THE THORN IS NOT A VERY HAPPY WAY OF TELLING THE READER HOW THE BOAR DIED ALL THROUGH THE VOLUME WE FIND THE SAME CURIOUS MIXTURE OF GOOD AND BAD
1112-128138-0005 IS AWKWARD AND UNCOUTH AND YET THE POEM IN WHICH THE EXPRESSION OCCURS HAS SOME PRETTY LINES MISTER IAN HAMILTON SHOULD PRUNE PRUNING WHETHER IN THE GARDEN OR IN THE STUDY
1112-128138-0006 MISTER CATTY DEDICATES HIS BOOK TO THE MEMORY OF WORDSWORTH SHELLEY COLERIDGE AND KEATS A SOMEWHAT POMPOUS SIGNBOARD FOR SUCH VERY ORDINARY WINE
1112-128138-0007 AND AN INSCRIPTION IN GOLDEN LETTERS ON THE COVER INFORMS US THAT HIS POEMS ARE ADDRESSED TO THE RISING GENERATION WHOM HE TELLS US ELSEWHERE HE IS ANXIOUS TO INITIATE INTO THE GREAT COMPREHENSIVE TRUTH THAT
1112-128138-0008 VIRTUE IS NO OTHER THAN SELF INTEREST DEEPLY UNDERSTOOD
1112-128138-0009 BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT CONVEY THAT SECRET TO THE READER IT IS HEAVY ABSTRACT AND PROSAIC AND SHOWS HOW INTOLERABLY DULL A MAN CAN BE WHO HAS THE BEST INTENTIONS AND THE MOST EARNEST BELIEFS
1112-128138-0010 IN THE REST OF THE VOLUME WHERE MISTER CATTY DOES NOT TAKE HIMSELF QUITE SO SERIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME RATHER PLEASING THINGS THE SONNET ON SHELLEY'S ROOM AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE WOULD BE ADMIRABLE
1112-128138-0011 GREEN IN THE WIZARD ARMS OF THE FOAM BEARDED ATLANTIC AN ISLE OF OLD ENCHANTMENT A MELANCHOLY ISLE ENCHANTED AND DREAMING LIES AND THERE BY SHANNON'S FLOWING IN THE MOONLIGHT SPECTRE THIN
1112-128138-0012 THE SPECTRE ERIN SITS WAIL NO MORE LONELY ONE MOTHER OF EXILE WAIL NO MORE BANSHEE OF THE WORLD NO MORE THY SORROWS ARE THE WORLD'S THOU ART NO MORE ALONE THY WRONGS THE WORLD'S
1112-128138-0013 ARE THE FIRST AND LAST STANZAS OF MISTER TODHUNTER'S POEM THE BANSHEE TO THROW AWAY THE NATURAL GRACE OF RHYME FROM A MODERN SONG IS AS MISTER SWINBURNE ONCE REMARKED
1112-128138-0014 A WILFUL ABDICATION OF HALF THE POWER AND HALF THE CHARM OF VERSE AND WE CANNOT SAY THAT MISTER TODHUNTER HAS GIVEN US MUCH THAT CONSOLES US FOR ITS LOSS PART OF HIS POEM READS LIKE A TRANSLATION OF AN OLD BARDIC SONG
1112-128138-0015 PART OF IT LIKE ROUGH MATERIAL FOR POETRY AND PART OF IT LIKE MISSHAPEN PROSE IT IS AN INTERESTING SPECIMEN OF POETIC WRITING BUT IT IS NOT A PERFECT WORK OF ART
1112-128138-0016 THE DOOM OF THE CHILDREN OF LIR AND THE LAMENTATION FOR THE SONS OF TURANN RHYME GIVES ARCHITECTURE AS WELL AS MELODY TO SONG
1112-128138-0017 AND THOUGH THE LOVELY LUTE BUILDED WALLS OF THEBES MAY HAVE RISEN UP TO UNRHYMED CHORAL METRES WE HAVE HAD NO MODERN AMPHION TO WORK SUCH WONDERS FOR US
1112-128138-0018 FIVE WERE THE CHIEFS WHO CHALLENGED BY THEIR DEEDS THE OVER KINGSHIP
1112-128138-0019 AND AFTER THEM STOOD UP MIDHIR THE PROUD WHO REIGNED UPON THE HILLS OF BRI OF BRI THE LOVED OF LIATH BRI OF THE BROKEN HEART AND LAST WAS ANGUS OG ALL THESE HAD MANY VOICES BUT FOR BOV DERG WERE MOST
1112-128138-0020 HAS OF COURSE AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTEREST BUT HAS NO ARTISTIC VALUE AT ALL INDEED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ART THE FEW LITTLE POEMS AT THE END OF THE VOLUME ARE WORTH ALL THE AMBITIOUS
1112-128138-0021 PSEUDO EPICS THAT MISTER TODHUNTER HAS TRIED TO CONSTRUCT OUT OF CELTIC LORE A BACCHIC DAY IS CHARMING AND THE SONNET ON THE OPEN AIR PERFORMANCE OF THE FAITHFULL SHEPHERDESSE
1112-128138-0022 IS MOST GRACEFULLY PHRASED AND MOST HAPPY IN CONCEPTION MISTER PEACOCK IS AN AMERICAN POET AND PROFESSOR THOMAS DANLEIGH SUPPLEE A M PH D F R S
1112-128138-0023 WHO HAS WRITTEN A PREFACE TO HIS POEMS OF THE PLAINS AND SONGS OF THE SOLITUDES TELLS US THAT HE IS ENTITLED TO BE CALLED THE LAUREATE OF THE WEST THOUGH A STAUNCH REPUBLICAN MISTER PEACOCK ACCORDING TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC PROFESSOR
1112-128138-0024 IS NOT ASHAMED OF HIS ANCESTOR KING WILLIAM OF HOLLAND NOR OF HIS RELATIVES LORD AND LADY PEACOCK WHO IT SEEMS ARE NATIVES OF SCOTLAND
1112-128138-0025 WHERE HIS FATHER EDITED THE ZANESVILLE AURORA AND HE HAD AN UNCLE WHO WAS A SUPERIOR MAN AND EDITED THE WHEELING INTELLIGENCER HIS POEMS SEEM TO BE EXTREMELY POPULAR AND HAVE BEEN HIGHLY PRAISED
1112-128138-0026 THE PROFESSOR INFORMS US BY VICTOR HUGO THE SATURDAY REVIEW AND THE COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER THE PREFACE IS THE MOST AMUSING PART OF THE BOOK BUT THE POEMS ALSO ARE WORTH STUDYING
1112-128138-0027 THE MANIAC THE BANDIT CHIEF AND THE OUTLAW CAN HARDLY BE CALLED LIGHT READING BUT WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE POEM ON CHICAGO CHICAGO GREAT CITY OF THE WEST ALL THAT WEALTH ALL THAT POWER INVEST
1112-128138-0028 THOU SPRANG LIKE MAGIC FROM THE SAND AS TOUCHED BY THE MAGICIAN'S WAND THOU SPRANG IS SLIGHTLY DEPRESSING AND THE SECOND LINE IS RATHER OBSCURE
1112-128138-0029 BUT WE SHOULD NOT MEASURE BY TOO HIGH A STANDARD THE UNTUTORED UTTERANCES OF ARTLESS NATURE THE OPENING LINES OF THE VENDETTA ALSO DESERVE MENTION WHEN STARS ARE GLOWING THROUGH DAY'S GLOAMING GLOW
1112-128138-0030 REFLECTING FROM OCEAN'S DEEP MIGHTY FLOW AT TWILIGHT WHEN NO GRIM SHADOWS OF NIGHT LIKE GHOULS HAVE STALKED IN WAKE OF THE LIGHT THE FIRST LINE IS CERTAINLY A MASTERPIECE AND INDEED THE WHOLE VOLUME IS FULL OF GEMS OF THIS KIND
1112-128138-0031 THE PROFESSOR REMARKS IN HIS ELABORATE PREFACE THAT MISTER PEACOCK FREQUENTLY RISES TO THE SUBLIME AND THE TWO PASSAGES QUOTED ABOVE SHOW HOW KEENLY CRITICAL IS HIS TASTE IN THESE MATTERS AND HOW WELL THE POET DESERVES HIS PANEGYRIC
1112-128138-0032 MISTER ALEXANDER SKENE SMITH'S HOLIDAY RECREATIONS AND OTHER POEMS IS HERALDED BY A PREFACE FOR WHICH PRINCIPAL CAIRNS IS RESPONSIBLE
1112-128138-0033 PRINCIPAL CAIRNS CLAIMS THAT THE LIFE STORY ENSHRINED IN MISTER SMITH'S POEMS SHOWS THE WIDE DIFFUSION OF NATIVE FIRE AND LITERARY CULTURE IN ALL PARTS OF SCOTLAND HAPPILY UNDER HIGHER AUSPICES THAN THOSE OF MERE POETIC IMPULSE
1112-128138-0034 THIS IS HARDLY A VERY FELICITOUS WAY OF INTRODUCING A POET NOR CAN WE SAY THAT MISTER SMITH'S POEMS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY EITHER FIRE OR CULTURE HE HAS A PLACID PLEASANT WAY OF WRITING AND INDEED HIS VERSES CANNOT DO ANY HARM
1112-128138-0035 THOUGH HE REALLY SHOULD NOT PUBLISH SUCH ATTEMPTS AT METRICAL VERSIONS OF THE PSALMS AS THE FOLLOWING A SEPTUAGENARIAN WE FREQUENTLY MAY SEE AN OCTOGENARIAN IF ONE SHOULD LIVE TO BE HE IS A BURDEN TO HIMSELF WITH WEARINESS AND WOE
1112-128138-0036 AND SOON HE DIES AND OFF HE FLIES AND LEAVETH ALL BELOW THE LITERARY CULTURE THAT PRODUCED THESE LINES IS WE FEAR NOT OF A VERY HIGH ORDER
1112-128138-0037 I STUDY POETRY SIMPLY AS A FINE ART BY WHICH I MAY EXERCISE MY INTELLECT AND ELEVATE MY TASTE WROTE THE LATE MISTER GEORGE MORINE MANY YEARS AGO TO A FRIEND
1112-128138-0038 ONE OF THE SONNETS THAT ENTITLED SUNSET APPEARED IN MISTER WADDINGTON'S ANTHOLOGY ABOUT TEN YEARS AFTER MISTER MORINE'S DEATH BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT HIS COLLECTED POEMS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED THEY ARE OFTEN DISTINGUISHED BY A GRAVE AND CHASTENED
1112-128138-0039 BEAUTY OF STYLE AND THEIR SOLEMN CADENCES HAVE SOMETHING OF THE GRAND MANNER ABOUT THEM THE EDITOR MISTER WILTON
1112-128138-0040 TO WHOM MISTER MORINE BEQUEATHED HIS MANUSCRIPTS SEEMS TO HAVE PERFORMED HIS TASK WITH GREAT TACT AND JUDGMENT AND WE HOPE THAT THIS LITTLE BOOK WILL MEET WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT IT DESERVES
1112-128138-0041 POEMS IN THE MODERN SPIRIT WITH THE SECRET OF CONTENT
