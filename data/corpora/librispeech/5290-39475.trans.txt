5290-39475-0000 MONSTERS OF ALL SORTS SWARM SUDDENLY UPON THE EARTH COMETS BLAZE IN THE SKY ECLIPSES FRIGHTEN NATURE METEORS FALL IN RAIN WHILE MERMAIDS AND SIRENS BEGUILE
5290-39475-0001 AND SEA SERPENTS ENGULF EVERY PASSING SHIP AND TERRIBLE CATACLYSMS BESET HUMANITY BUT THE STRANGE EVENT WHICH I SHALL HERE RELATE CAME ALONE UNSUPPORTED WITHOUT COMPANIONS INTO A HOSTILE WORLD
5290-39475-0002 AND FOR THAT VERY REASON CLAIMED LITTLE OF THE GENERAL ATTENTION OF MANKIND FOR THE SUDDEN CHANGING OF MISSUS TEBRICK INTO A VIXEN IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT WHICH WE MAY ATTEMPT TO ACCOUNT FOR AS WE WILL
5290-39475-0003 CERTAINLY IT IS IN THE EXPLANATION OF THE FACT AND THE RECONCILING OF IT WITH OUR GENERAL NOTIONS THAT WE SHALL FIND MOST DIFFICULTY AND NOT IN ACCEPTING FOR TRUE A STORY WHICH IS SO FULLY PROVED
5290-39475-0004 AND THAT NOT BY ONE WITNESS BUT BY A DOZEN ALL RESPECTABLE AND WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THEM BUT HERE I WILL CONFINE MYSELF TO AN EXACT NARRATIVE OF THE EVENT AND ALL THAT FOLLOWED ON IT
5290-39475-0005 YET I WOULD NOT DISSUADE ANY OF MY READERS FROM ATTEMPTING AN EXPLANATION OF THIS SEEMING MIRACLE BECAUSE UP TILL NOW NONE HAS BEEN FOUND WHICH IS ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY
5290-39475-0006 THE GRADUAL EXTENSION OF HAIR ALL OVER THE BODY THE SLOW CHANGE OF THE WHOLE ANATOMY BY A PROCESS OF GROWTH THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MONSTROUS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE TO OUR ORDINARY CONCEPTIONS
5290-39475-0007 PARTICULARLY HAD IT HAPPENED IN A YOUNG CHILD BUT HERE WE HAVE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT A GROWN LADY IS CHANGED STRAIGHTWAY INTO A FOX THERE IS NO EXPLAINING THAT AWAY BY ANY NATURAL PHILOSOPHY
5290-39475-0008 THE MATERIALISM OF OUR AGE WILL NOT HELP US HERE IT IS INDEED A MIRACLE SOMETHING FROM OUTSIDE OUR WORLD ALTOGETHER
5290-39475-0009 AN EVENT WHICH WE WOULD WILLINGLY ACCEPT IF WE WERE TO MEET IT INVESTED WITH THE AUTHORITY OF DIVINE REVELATION IN THE SCRIPTURES BUT WHICH WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO ENCOUNTER ALMOST IN OUR TIME HAPPENING IN OXFORDSHIRE AMONGST OUR NEIGHBOURS
5290-39475-0010 THE ONLY THINGS WHICH GO ANY WAY TOWARDS AN EXPLANATION OF IT ARE BUT GUESSWORK AND I GIVE THEM MORE BECAUSE I WOULD NOT CONCEAL ANYTHING THAN BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE OF ANY WORTH MISSUS TEBRICK'S MAIDEN NAME WAS CERTAINLY FOX
5290-39475-0011 THEY WERE AN ANCIENT FAMILY AND HAVE HAD THEIR SEAT AT TANGLEY HALL TIME OUT OF MIND IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THERE WAS A HALF TAME FOX ONCE UPON A TIME CHAINED UP AT TANGLEY HALL IN THE INNER YARD
5290-39475-0012 AND I HAVE HEARD MANY SPECULATIVE WISEACRES IN THE PUBLIC HOUSES TURN THAT TO GREAT ACCOUNT THOUGH THEY COULD NOT BUT ADMIT THAT THERE WAS NEVER ONE THERE IN MISS SILVIA'S TIME AT FIRST I WAS INCLINED TO THINK THAT SILVIA FOX
5290-39475-0013 HAVING ONCE HUNTED WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD OF TEN AND HAVING BEEN BLOODED MIGHT FURNISH MORE OF AN EXPLANATION IT SEEMS SHE TOOK GREAT FRIGHT OR DISGUST AT IT AND VOMITED AFTER IT WAS DONE
5290-39475-0014 BUT NOW I DO NOT SEE THAT IT HAS MUCH BEARING ON THE MIRACLE ITSELF EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT AFTER THAT SHE ALWAYS SPOKE OF THE POOR FOXES
5290-39475-0015 WHEN A HUNT WAS STIRRING AND NEVER RODE TO HOUNDS TILL AFTER HER MARRIAGE WHEN HER HUSBAND PERSUADED HER TO IT SHE WAS MARRIED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE TO MISTER RICHARD TEBRICK AFTER A SHORT COURTSHIP
5290-39475-0016 NEAR STOKOE OXON ONE POINT INDEED I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN AND THAT IS HOW THEY FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED TANGLEY HALL IS OVER THIRTY MILES FROM STOKOE AND IS EXTREMELY REMOTE
5290-39475-0017 INDEED TO THIS DAY THERE IS NO PROPER ROAD TO IT WHICH IS ALL THE MORE REMARKABLE
5290-39475-0018 AS IT IS THE PRINCIPAL AND INDEED THE ONLY MANOR HOUSE FOR SEVERAL MILES ROUND WHETHER IT WAS FROM A CHANCE MEETING ON THE ROADS OR LESS ROMANTIC BUT MORE PROBABLE BY MISTER TEBRICK BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH HER UNCLE
5290-39475-0019 A MINOR CANON AT OXFORD AND THENCE BEING INVITED BY HIM TO VISIT TANGLEY HALL IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY BUT HOWEVER THEY BECAME ACQUAINTED THE MARRIAGE WAS A VERY HAPPY ONE THE BRIDE WAS IN HER TWENTY THIRD YEAR
5290-39475-0020 SHE WAS SMALL WITH REMARKABLY SMALL HANDS AND FEET IT IS PERHAPS WORTH NOTING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL FOXY OR VIXENISH IN HER APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY SHE WAS A MORE THAN ORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL AND AGREEABLE WOMAN
5290-39475-0021 HER EYES WERE OF A CLEAR HAZEL BUT EXCEPTIONALLY BRILLIANT HER HAIR DARK WITH A SHADE OF RED IN IT HER SKIN BROWNISH WITH A FEW DARK FRECKLES AND LITTLE MOLES
5290-39475-0022 IN MANNER SHE WAS RESERVED ALMOST TO SHYNESS BUT PERFECTLY SELF POSSESSED AND PERFECTLY WELL BRED SHE HAD BEEN STRICTLY BROUGHT UP BY A WOMAN OF EXCELLENT PRINCIPLES AND CONSIDERABLE ATTAINMENTS
5290-39475-0023 WHO DIED A YEAR OR SO BEFORE THE MARRIAGE AND OWING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DEAD MANY YEARS AND HER FATHER BEDRIDDEN AND NOT ALTOGETHER RATIONAL FOR A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HIS DEATH THEY HAD FEW VISITORS BUT HER UNCLE
5290-39475-0024 HE OFTEN STOPPED WITH THEM A MONTH OR TWO AT A STRETCH PARTICULARLY IN WINTER AS HE WAS FOND OF SHOOTING SNIPE WHICH ARE PLENTIFUL IN THE VALLEY THERE THAT SHE DID NOT GROW UP A COUNTRY HOYDEN IS TO BE EXPLAINED BY THE STRICTNESS OF HER GOVERNESS
5290-39475-0025 AND THE INFLUENCE OF HER UNCLE BUT PERHAPS LIVING IN SO WILD A PLACE GAVE HER SOME DISPOSITION TO WILDNESS EVEN IN SPITE OF HER RELIGIOUS UPBRINGING HER OLD NURSE SAID MISS SILVIA WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE WILD AT HEART
5290-39475-0026 THOUGH IF THIS WAS TRUE IT WAS NEVER SEEN BY ANYONE ELSE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND ON ONE OF THE FIRST DAYS OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON
5290-39475-0027 THEY WERE STILL AT THIS TIME LIKE LOVERS IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR AND WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER WHILE THEY WERE WALKING THEY HEARD THE HOUNDS AND LATER THE HUNTSMAN'S HORN IN THE DISTANCE MISTER TEBRICK HAD PERSUADED HER TO HUNT ON BOXING DAY
5290-39475-0028 BUT WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND SHE HAD NOT ENJOYED IT THOUGH OF HACKING SHE WAS FOND ENOUGH HEARING THE HUNT MISTER TEBRICK QUICKENED HIS PACE SO AS TO REACH THE EDGE OF THE COPSE WHERE THEY MIGHT GET A GOOD VIEW OF THE HOUNDS IF THEY CAME THAT WAY
5290-39475-0029 HIS WIFE HUNG BACK AND HE HOLDING HER HAND BEGAN ALMOST TO DRAG HER BEFORE THEY GAINED THE EDGE OF THE COPSE SHE SUDDENLY SNATCHED HER HAND AWAY FROM HIS VERY VIOLENTLY AND CRIED OUT SO THAT HE INSTANTLY TURNED HIS HEAD
5290-39475-0030 WHERE HIS WIFE HAD BEEN THE MOMENT BEFORE WAS A SMALL FOX OF A VERY BRIGHT RED IT LOOKED AT HIM VERY BESEECHINGLY ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM A PACE OR TWO
5290-39475-0031 AND HE SAW AT ONCE THAT HIS WIFE WAS LOOKING AT HIM FROM THE ANIMAL'S EYES YOU MAY WELL THINK IF HE WERE AGHAST AND SO MAYBE WAS HIS LADY AT FINDING HERSELF IN THAT SHAPE SO THEY DID NOTHING FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR BUT STARE AT EACH OTHER
5290-39475-0032 HE BEWILDERED SHE ASKING HIM WITH HER EYES AS IF INDEED SHE SPOKE TO HIM WHAT AM I NOW BECOME HAVE PITY ON ME HUSBAND HAVE PITY ON ME FOR I AM YOUR WIFE
5290-39475-0033 SO THAT WITH HIS GAZING ON HER AND KNOWING HER WELL EVEN IN SUCH A SHAPE
5290-39475-0034 BUT SAT DOWN ON THE GROUND AND SOBBED FOR A GREAT WHILE BUT BETWEEN HIS SOBS KISSING HER QUITE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN AND NOT CARING IN HIS GRIEF THAT HE WAS KISSING A FOX ON THE MUZZLE THEY SAT THUS TILL IT WAS GETTING NEAR DUSK
5290-39475-0035 WHEN HE RECOLLECTED HIMSELF AND THE NEXT THING WAS THAT HE MUST SOMEHOW HIDE HER AND THEN BRING HER HOME HE WAITED TILL IT WAS QUITE DARK THAT HE MIGHT THE BETTER BRING HER INTO HER OWN HOUSE WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND BUTTONED HER INSIDE HIS TOPCOAT
5290-39475-0036 NAY EVEN IN HIS PASSION TEARING OPEN HIS WAISTCOAT AND HIS SHIRT THAT SHE MIGHT LIE THE CLOSER TO HIS HEART FOR WHEN WE ARE OVERCOME WITH THE GREATEST SORROW WE ACT NOT LIKE MEN OR WOMEN
5290-39475-0037 BUT LIKE CHILDREN WHOSE COMFORT IN ALL THEIR TROUBLES IS TO PRESS THEMSELVES AGAINST THEIR MOTHER'S BREAST OR IF SHE BE NOT THERE TO HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHT IN ONE ANOTHER'S ARMS WHEN IT WAS DARK HE BROUGHT HER IN WITH INFINITE PRECAUTIONS
5290-39475-0038 HAVING GOT HER INTO THE HOUSE THE NEXT THING HE THOUGHT OF WAS TO HIDE HER FROM THE SERVANTS HE CARRIED HER TO THE BEDROOM IN HIS ARMS AND THEN WENT DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN MISTER TEBRICK HAD THREE SERVANTS LIVING IN THE HOUSE THE COOK
5290-39475-0039 THE PARLOUR MAID AND AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN HIS WIFE'S NURSE BESIDES THESE WOMEN THERE WAS A GROOM OR A GARDENER WHICHEVER YOU CHOOSE TO CALL HIM WHO WAS A SINGLE MAN AND SO LIVED OUT LODGING WITH A LABOURING FAMILY ABOUT HALF A MILE AWAY
5290-39475-0040 MISTER TEBRICK GOING DOWNSTAIRS PITCHED UPON THE PARLOUR MAID JANET SAYS HE MISSUS TEBRICK AND I HAVE HAD SOME BAD NEWS AND MISSUS TEBRICK WAS CALLED AWAY INSTANTLY TO LONDON AND LEFT THIS AFTERNOON
5290-39475-0041 AND I AM STAYING TO NIGHT TO PUT OUR AFFAIRS IN ORDER WE ARE SHUTTING UP THE HOUSE AND I MUST GIVE YOU AND MISSUS BRANT A MONTH'S WAGES AND ASK YOU TO LEAVE TO MORROW MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK WE SHALL PROBABLY GO AWAY TO THE CONTINENT
5290-39475-0042 AND I DO NOT KNOW WHEN WE SHALL COME BACK PLEASE TELL THE OTHERS AND NOW GET ME MY TEA AND BRING IT INTO MY STUDY ON A TRAY JANET SAID NOTHING FOR SHE WAS A SHY GIRL PARTICULARLY BEFORE GENTLEMEN
5290-39475-0043 BUT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE KITCHEN MISTER TEBRICK HEARD A SUDDEN BURST OF CONVERSATION WITH MANY EXCLAMATIONS FROM THE COOK WHEN SHE CAME BACK WITH HIS TEA MISTER TEBRICK SAID I SHALL NOT REQUIRE YOU UPSTAIRS
5290-39475-0044 PACK YOUR OWN THINGS AND TELL JAMES TO HAVE THE WAGGONETTE READY FOR YOU BY SEVEN O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING TO TAKE YOU TO THE STATION I AM BUSY NOW BUT I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN BEFORE YOU GO WHEN SHE HAD GONE MISTER TEBRICK TOOK THE TRAY UPSTAIRS
5290-39475-0045 FOR THE FIRST MOMENT HE THOUGHT THE ROOM WAS EMPTY AND HIS VIXEN GOT AWAY FOR HE COULD SEE NO SIGN OF HER ANYWHERE BUT AFTER A MOMENT HE SAW SOMETHING STIRRING IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM AND THEN BEHOLD SHE CAME FORTH DRAGGING HER DRESSING GOWN
5290-39475-0046 INTO WHICH SHE HAD SOMEHOW STRUGGLED THIS MUST SURELY HAVE BEEN A COMICAL SIGHT BUT POOR MISTER TEBRICK WAS ALTOGETHER TOO DISTRESSED THEN OR AT ANY TIME AFTERWARDS TO DIVERT HIMSELF AT SUCH LUDICROUS SCENES
5290-39475-0047 HE ONLY CALLED TO HER SOFTLY SILVIA SILVIA WHAT DO YOU DO THERE AND THEN IN A MOMENT SAW FOR HIMSELF WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT AND BEGAN ONCE MORE TO BLAME HIMSELF HEARTILY
5290-39475-0048 BECAUSE HE HAD NOT GUESSED THAT HIS WIFE WOULD NOT LIKE TO GO NAKED NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHAPE SHE WAS IN NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THEN TILL HE HAD CLOTHED HER SUITABLY BRINGING HER DRESSES FROM THE WARDROBE FOR HER TO CHOOSE
5290-39475-0049 BUT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THEY WERE TOO BIG FOR HER NOW BUT AT LAST HE PICKED OUT A LITTLE DRESSING JACKET THAT SHE WAS FOND OF WEARING SOMETIMES IN THE MORNINGS IT WAS MADE OF A FLOWERED SILK TRIMMED WITH LACE
5290-39475-0050 WHILE HE TIED THE RIBANDS HIS POOR LADY THANKED HIM WITH GENTLE LOOKS AND NOT WITHOUT SOME MODESTY AND CONFUSION HE PROPPED HER UP IN AN ARMCHAIR WITH SOME CUSHIONS AND THEY TOOK TEA TOGETHER
5290-39475-0051 SHE VERY DELICATELY DRINKING FROM A SAUCER AND TAKING BREAD AND BUTTER FROM HIS HANDS ALL THIS SHOWED HIM OR SO HE THOUGHT THAT HIS WIFE WAS STILL HERSELF THERE WAS SO LITTLE WILDNESS IN HER DEMEANOUR AND SO MUCH DELICACY AND DECENCY
5290-39475-0052 ESPECIALLY IN HER NOT WISHING TO RUN NAKED THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH COMFORTED AND BEGAN TO FANCY THEY COULD BE HAPPY ENOUGH IF THEY COULD ESCAPE THE WORLD AND LIVE ALWAYS ALONE FROM THIS TOO SANGUINE DREAM HE WAS AROUSED
5290-39475-0053 AND ALL AS HE KNEW BECAUSE THERE WAS A FOX WITHIN DOORS AND THEY WOULD KILL IT HE STARTED UP NOW CALLING TO THE GARDENER THAT HE WOULD COME DOWN TO THE DOGS HIMSELF TO QUIET THEM AND BADE THE MAN GO INDOORS AGAIN AND LEAVE IT TO HIM
5290-39475-0054 ALL THIS HE SAID IN A DRY COMPELLING KIND OF VOICE WHICH MADE THE FELLOW DO AS HE WAS BID THOUGH IT WAS AGAINST HIS WILL FOR HE WAS CURIOUS MISTER TEBRICK WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND TAKING HIS GUN FROM THE RACK LOADED IT
5290-39475-0055 AND WENT OUT INTO THE YARD NOW THERE WERE TWO DOGS ONE A HANDSOME IRISH SETTER THAT WAS HIS WIFE'S DOG SHE HAD BROUGHT IT WITH HER FROM TANGLEY HALL ON HER MARRIAGE THE OTHER
5290-39475-0056 WAS AN OLD FOX TERRIER CALLED NELLY THAT HE HAD HAD TEN YEARS OR MORE
5290-39475-0057 THE SETTER JUMPING UP AND DOWN AT THE END OF HIS CHAIN IN A FRENZY AND NELLY SHIVERING WAGGING HER TAIL AND LOOKING FIRST AT HER MASTER AND THEN AT THE HOUSE DOOR WHERE SHE COULD SMELL THE FOX RIGHT ENOUGH
5290-39475-0058 THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOON SO THAT MISTER TEBRICK COULD SEE THE DOGS AS CLEARLY AS COULD BE FIRST HE SHOT HIS WIFE'S SETTER DEAD AND THEN LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR NELLY TO GIVE HER THE OTHER BARREL BUT HE COULD SEE HER NOWHERE
5290-39475-0059 THE BITCH WAS CLEAN GONE TILL LOOKING TO SEE HOW SHE HAD BROKEN HER CHAIN HE FOUND HER LYING HID IN THE BACK OF HER KENNEL BUT THAT TRICK DID NOT SAVE HER FOR MISTER TEBRICK AFTER TRYING TO PULL HER OUT BY HER CHAIN AND FINDING IT USELESS SHE WOULD NOT COME
5290-39475-0060 THRUST THE MUZZLE OF HIS GUN INTO THE KENNEL PRESSED IT INTO HER BODY AND SO SHOT HER AFTERWARDS STRIKING A MATCH HE LOOKED IN AT HER TO MAKE CERTAIN SHE WAS DEAD THEN LEAVING THE DOGS AS THEY WERE CHAINED UP
5290-39475-0061 MISTER TEBRICK WENT INDOORS AGAIN AND FOUND THE GARDENER WHO HAD NOT YET GONE HOME GAVE HIM A MONTH'S WAGES IN LIEU OF NOTICE AND TOLD HIM HE HAD A JOB FOR HIM YET TO BURY THE TWO DOGS AND THAT HE SHOULD DO IT THAT SAME NIGHT
5290-39475-0062 BUT BY ALL THIS GOING ON WITH SO MUCH STRANGENESS AND AUTHORITY ON HIS PART AS IT SEEMED TO THEM THE SERVANTS WERE MUCH TROUBLED HEARING THE SHOTS WHILE HE WAS OUT IN THE YARD HIS WIFE'S OLD NURSE OR NANNY
5290-39475-0063 RAN UP TO THE BEDROOM THOUGH SHE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE AND SO OPENING THE DOOR SAW THE POOR FOX DRESSED IN MY LADY'S LITTLE JACKET LYING BACK IN THE CUSHIONS AND IN SUCH A REVERIE OF WOE THAT SHE HEARD NOTHING OLD NANNY
5290-39475-0064 THOUGH SHE WAS NOT EXPECTING TO FIND HER MISTRESS THERE HAVING BEEN TOLD THAT SHE WAS GONE THAT AFTERNOON TO LONDON KNEW HER INSTANTLY AND CRIED OUT OH MY POOR PRECIOUS OH POOR MISS SILVIA
5290-39475-0065 WHAT DREADFUL CHANGE IS THIS THEN SEEING HER MISTRESS START AND LOOK AT HER SHE CRIED OUT BUT NEVER FEAR MY DARLING IT WILL ALL COME RIGHT YOUR OLD NANNY KNOWS YOU IT WILL ALL COME RIGHT IN THE END
5290-39475-0066 AND KEPT HER EYES TURNED AWAY SO AS NOT TO MEET THE FOXY SLIT ONES OF HER MISTRESS FOR THAT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER SO SHE HURRIED OUT SOON FEARING TO BE FOUND THERE BY MISTER TEBRICK
5290-39475-0067 AND WHO KNOWS PERHAPS SHOT LIKE THE DOGS FOR KNOWING THE SECRET MISTER TEBRICK HAD ALL THIS TIME GONE ABOUT PAYING OFF HIS SERVANTS AND SHOOTING HIS DOGS AS IF HE WERE IN A DREAM
