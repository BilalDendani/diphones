2152-133013-0000 TRAVELLERS DID NOT OFTEN CARRY FULL INFORMATION ON CHRISTIAN ART EITHER IN THEIR HEADS OR THEIR POCKETS AND EVEN THE MOST BRILLIANT ENGLISH CRITIC OF THE DAY MISTOOK THE FLOWER FLUSHED TOMB OF THE ASCENDED VIRGIN
2152-133013-0001 FOR AN ORNAMENTAL VASE DUE TO THE PAINTER'S FANCY
2152-133013-0002 FERMENTING STILL AS A DISTINGUISHABLE VIGOROUS ENTHUSIASM IN CERTAIN LONG HAIRED GERMAN ARTISTS AT ROME AND THE YOUTH OF OTHER NATIONS WHO WORKED OR IDLED NEAR THEM WERE SOMETIMES CAUGHT IN THE SPREADING MOVEMENT
2152-133013-0003 ONE FINE MORNING A YOUNG MAN WHOSE HAIR WAS NOT IMMODERATELY LONG BUT ABUNDANT AND CURLY AND WHO WAS OTHERWISE ENGLISH IN HIS EQUIPMENT HAD JUST TURNED HIS BACK ON THE BELVEDERE TORSO
2152-133013-0004 IN THE VATICAN AND WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF THE MOUNTAINS FROM THE ADJOINING ROUND VESTIBULE HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ABSORBED NOT TO NOTICE THE APPROACH OF A DARK EYED ANIMATED GERMAN WHO CAME UP TO HIM AND PLACING A HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
2152-133013-0005 SAID WITH A STRONG ACCENT COME HERE QUICK ELSE SHE WILL HAVE CHANGED HER POSE QUICKNESS WAS READY AT THE CALL AND THE TWO FIGURES PASSED LIGHTLY ALONG BY THE MELEAGER TOWARDS THE HALL
2152-133013-0006 WHERE THE RECLINING ARIADNE THEN CALLED THE CLEOPATRA LIES IN THE MARBLE VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF HER BEAUTY THE DRAPERY FOLDING AROUND HER WITH A PETAL LIKE EASE AND TENDERNESS
2152-133013-0007 THEY WERE JUST IN TIME TO SEE ANOTHER FIGURE STANDING AGAINST A PEDESTAL NEAR THE RECLINING MARBLE A BREATHING BLOOMING GIRL WHOSE FORM
2152-133013-0008 QUAKERISH GRAY DRAPERY HER LONG CLOAK FASTENED AT THE NECK WAS THROWN BACKWARD FROM HER ARMS AND ONE BEAUTIFUL UNGLOVED HAND PILLOWED HER CHEEK PUSHING SOMEWHAT BACKWARD THE WHITE BEAVER BONNET
2152-133013-0009 HALO TO HER FACE AROUND THE SIMPLY BRAIDED DARK BROWN HAIR SHE WAS NOT LOOKING AT THE SCULPTURE PROBABLY NOT THINKING OF IT HER LARGE EYES WERE FIXED DREAMILY ON A STREAK OF SUNLIGHT WHICH FELL ACROSS THE FLOOR
2152-133013-0010 BUT SHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE TWO STRANGERS WHO SUDDENLY PAUSED AS IF TO CONTEMPLATE THE CLEOPATRA AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEM IMMEDIATELY TURNED AWAY TO JOIN A MAID SERVANT
2152-133013-0011 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT FOR A FINE BIT OF ANTITHESIS SAID THE GERMAN SEARCHING IN HIS FRIEND'S FACE FOR RESPONDING ADMIRATION BUT GOING ON VOLUBLY WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY OTHER ANSWER
2152-133013-0012 THERE LIES ANTIQUE BEAUTY NOT CORPSE LIKE EVEN IN DEATH BUT ARRESTED IN THE COMPLETE CONTENTMENT OF ITS SENSUOUS PERFECTION AND HERE STANDS BEAUTY IN ITS BREATHING LIFE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF CHRISTIAN CENTURIES IN ITS BOSOM
2152-133013-0013 I SAW HER WEDDING RING ON THAT WONDERFUL LEFT HAND
2152-133013-0014 I SAW HIM PARTING FROM HER A GOOD WHILE AGO AND JUST NOW I FOUND HER IN THAT MAGNIFICENT POSE ONLY THINK HE IS PERHAPS RICH AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HER PORTRAIT TAKEN AH
2152-133013-0015 THERE SHE GOES LET US FOLLOW HER HOME NO NO SAID HIS COMPANION WITH A LITTLE FROWN YOU ARE SINGULAR LADISLAW YOU LOOK STRUCK TOGETHER DO YOU KNOW HER I
2152-133013-0016 SAUNTERING DOWN THE HALL WITH A PREOCCUPIED AIR WHILE HIS GERMAN FRIEND KEPT AT HIS SIDE AND WATCHED HIM EAGERLY WHAT
2152-133013-0017 HE LOOKS MORE LIKE AN UNCLE A MORE USEFUL SORT OF RELATION HE IS NOT MY UNCLE I TELL YOU HE IS MY SECOND COUSIN SAID LADISLAW WITH SOME IRRITATION
2152-133013-0018 YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME FOR THINKING MISSUS SECOND COUSIN THE MOST PERFECT YOUNG MADONNA I EVER SAW ANGRY NONSENSE I HAVE ONLY SEEN HER ONCE BEFORE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES WHEN MY COUSIN INTRODUCED HER TO ME JUST BEFORE I LEFT ENGLAND
2152-133013-0019 THEY WERE NOT MARRIED THEN I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE COMING TO ROME BUT YOU WILL GO TO SEE THEM NOW YOU WILL FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAVE FOR AN ADDRESS SINCE YOU KNOW THE NAME SHALL WE GO TO THE POST AND YOU COULD SPEAK ABOUT THE PORTRAIT
2152-133013-0020 CONFOUND YOU NAUMANN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO I AM NOT SO BRAZEN AS YOU BAH
2152-133013-0021 AND AMATEURISH IF YOU WERE AN ARTIST YOU WOULD THINK OF MISTRESS SECOND COUSIN AS ANTIQUE FORM ANIMATED BY CHRISTIAN SENTIMENT
2152-133013-0022 SENSUOUS FORCE CONTROLLED BY SPIRITUAL PASSION YES AND THAT YOUR PAINTING HER WAS THE CHIEF OUTCOME OF HER EXISTENCE THE DIVINITY PASSING INTO HIGHER COMPLETENESS AND ALL BUT EXHAUSTED IN THE ACT OF COVERING YOUR BIT OF CANVAS
2152-133013-0023 I DO NOT THINK THAT ALL THE UNIVERSE IS STRAINING TOWARDS THE OBSCURE SIGNIFICANCE OF YOUR PICTURES
2152-133013-0024 SO FAR AS IT IS STRAINING THROUGH ME ADOLF NAUMANN
2152-133013-0025 SAID THE GOOD NATURED PAINTER
2152-133013-0026 AND AS A PAINTER I HAVE A CONCEPTION WHICH IS ALTOGETHER GENIALISCH OF YOUR GREAT AUNT OR SECOND GRANDMOTHER AS A SUBJECT FOR A PICTURE THEREFORE THE UNIVERSE IS STRAINING TOWARDS THAT PICTURE THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR HOOK OR CLAW
2152-133013-0027 WHICH IT PUTS FORTH IN THE SHAPE OF ME NOT TRUE BUT HOW IF ANOTHER CLAW IN THE SHAPE OF ME IS STRAINING TO THWART IT THE CASE IS A LITTLE LESS SIMPLE THEN NOT AT ALL THE RESULT OF THE STRUGGLE IS THE SAME THING PICTURE OR NO PICTURE LOGICALLY
2152-133013-0028 NO NONSENSE NAUMANN ENGLISH LADIES ARE NOT AT EVERYBODY'S SERVICE AS MODELS AND YOU WANT TO EXPRESS TOO MUCH WITH YOUR PAINTING YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE A BETTER OR WORSE PORTRAIT WITH A BACKGROUND
2152-133013-0029 WHICH EVERY CONNOISSEUR WOULD GIVE A DIFFERENT REASON FOR OR AGAINST AND WHAT IS A PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN YOUR PAINTING AND PLASTIK ARE POOR STUFF AFTER ALL THEY PERTURB AND DULL CONCEPTIONS INSTEAD OF RAISING THEM LANGUAGE IS A FINER MEDIUM
2152-133013-0030 YES FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T PAINT SAID NAUMANN THERE YOU HAVE PERFECT RIGHT I DID NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO PAINT MY FRIEND THE AMIABLE ARTIST CARRIED HIS STING BUT LADISLAW DID NOT CHOOSE TO APPEAR STUNG
2152-133013-0031 HE WENT ON AS IF HE HAD NOT HEARD LANGUAGE GIVES A FULLER IMAGE WHICH IS ALL THE BETTER FOR BEINGS VAGUE AFTER ALL THE TRUE SEEING IS WITHIN AND PAINTING STARES AT YOU WITH AN INSISTENT IMPERFECTION I FEEL THAT ESPECIALLY ABOUT
2152-133013-0032 YOU MUST WAIT FOR MOVEMENT AND TONE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR VERY BREATHING THEY CHANGE FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT THIS WOMAN WHOM YOU HAVE JUST SEEN FOR EXAMPLE HOW WOULD YOU PAINT HER VOICE PRAY
2152-133013-0033 BUT HER VOICE IS MUCH DIVINER THAN ANYTHING YOU HAVE SEEN OF HER I SEE I SEE YOU ARE JEALOUS NO MAN MUST PRESUME TO THINK THAT HE CAN PAINT YOUR IDEAL THIS IS SERIOUS MY FRIEND
2152-133013-0034 YOU AND I SHALL QUARREL NAUMANN IF YOU CALL THAT LADY MY AUNT AGAIN HOW IS SHE TO BE CALLED THEN
2152-133013-0035 GOOD SUPPOSE I GET ACQUAINTED WITH HER IN SPITE OF YOU
2152-133013-0036 YES SUPPOSE SAID WILL LADISLAW IN A CONTEMPTUOUS UNDERTONE INTENDED TO DISMISS THE SUBJECT
