6249-102849-0000 THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS
6249-102849-0001 I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
6249-102849-0002 BUT I FINALLY WAS REWARDED BY SEEING IT SWING UPON ITS HUGE HINGES AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE
6249-102849-0003 I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS
6249-102849-0004 THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
6249-102849-0005 AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES
6249-102849-0006 SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION
6249-102849-0007 WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK A GREAT GOLDEN CHAIN WITH A COLLAR
6249-102849-0008 AND PADLOCK AT EACH END DIRECTLY BEHIND THESE OFFICERS CAME FOUR OTHERS CARRYING A SIMILAR SALVER
6249-102849-0009 OF A PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF THE REIGNING HOUSE OF ZODANGA AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY
6249-102849-0010 WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED
6249-102849-0011 AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
6249-102849-0012 THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS
6249-102849-0013 AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
6249-102849-0014 THE OBJECT OF THE CEREMONY WAS CLEAR TO ME IN ANOTHER MOMENT DEJAH THORIS WOULD BE JOINED FOREVER TO THE PRINCE OF ZODANGA IT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE AND BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY I PRESUME
6249-102849-0015 BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD
6249-102849-0016 SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD AND WITH THE HEAVY HILT I SHATTERED THE GLASS OF THE GREAT WINDOW AND SPRANG INTO THE MIDST OF THE ASTONISHED ASSEMBLAGE
6249-102849-0017 WITH A BOUND I WAS ON THE STEPS OF THE PLATFORM BESIDE THAN KOSIS AND AS HE STOOD RIVETED WITH SURPRISE I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER
6249-102849-0018 IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER AND SAB THAN SPRANG UPON ME WITH A JEWELED DAGGER HE HAD DRAWN FROM HIS NUPTIAL ORNAMENTS
6249-102849-0019 I COULD HAVE KILLED HIM AS EASILY AS I MIGHT A FLY BUT THE AGE OLD CUSTOM OF BARSOOM STAYED MY HAND AND GRASPING HIS WRIST AS THE DAGGER FLEW TOWARD MY HEART I HELD HIM AS THOUGH IN A VISE
6249-102849-0020 AND WITH MY LONG SWORD POINTED TO THE FAR END OF THE HALL ZODANGA HAS FALLEN I CRIED LOOK ALL EYES TURNED IN THE DIRECTION I HAD INDICATED AND THERE FORGING THROUGH THE PORTALS OF THE ENTRANCEWAY
6249-102849-0021 RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
6249-102849-0022 WERE HURLING THEMSELVES UPON THE ADVANCING THARKS THRUSTING SAB THAN HEADLONG FROM THE PLATFORM I DREW DEJAH THORIS TO MY SIDE BEHIND THE THRONE WAS A NARROW DOORWAY AND IN THIS
6249-102849-0023 THAN KOSIS NOW STOOD FACING ME WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
6249-102849-0024 BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS HIS FATHER ROLLED DEAD UPON THE FLOOR
6249-102849-0025 THE NEW JEDDAK TORE HIMSELF FREE FROM DEJAH THORIS GRASP AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS
6249-102849-0026 I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF AND YET NOT STRIKE DOWN SAB THAN AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS
6249-102849-0027 TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF
6249-102849-0028 KILL HER KILL HER CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES
6249-102849-0029 FOR GAINING A POSITION WHERE I COULD HAVE DEFENDED DEJAH THORIS AGAINST AN ARMY OF SWORDSMEN THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM AND I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE COULD SAVE DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF
6249-102849-0030 WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET AND SO HE HEWED A PATHWAY BEFORE HIM
6249-102849-0031 THE BRAVERY OF THE ZODANGANS WAS AWE INSPIRING NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF
6249-102849-0032 SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES
6249-102849-0033 AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS
6249-102849-0034 THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT
6249-102849-0035 AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL
6249-102849-0036 HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
6249-102849-0037 SO AT HIS SUGGESTION I RETURNED TO SEARCH THE BODIES ON THE FLOOR ABOVE FOR KEYS TO OPEN THE PADLOCKS OF HIS CELL AND OF HIS CHAINS FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER
6249-102849-0038 AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT
6249-102849-0039 KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
6249-102849-0040 SHE HAD SUNK INTO ONE OF THE GOLDEN THRONES AND AS I TURNED TO HER SHE GREETED ME WITH A WAN SMILE

6249-102849-0044 A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE
6249-102849-0045 I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF
