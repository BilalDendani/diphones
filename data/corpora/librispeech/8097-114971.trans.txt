8097-114971-0000 BEETHORPE WAS AN ANCIENT TOWN MYSTERIOUSLY SOWN CENTURIES AGO LIKE A WANDERING THISTLE DOWN OF HUMAN LIFE AMID THE SILENCE AND THE NIBBLING SHEEP OF THE GREAT CHALK DOWNS
8097-114971-0001 IT STOOD IN A HOLLOW OF THE LONG SMOOTH BILLOWS OF PALE PASTURE THAT SUAVELY MELTED INTO THE SKY ON EVERY SIDE THE EVENING WAS SO STILL
8097-114971-0002 THAT THE LITTLE RIVER RUNNING ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE TOWN AND ENCIRCLING WHAT REMAINED OF ITS OLD WALLS WAS THE NOISIEST THING TO BE HEARD DOMINATING WITH ITS TALKATIVE MURMUR THE BEDTIME HUM OF THE HIGH STREET
8097-114971-0003 SUDDENLY AS THE FLAMBOYANCE OF THE SKY WAS ON THE EDGE OF FADING AND THE WORLD BEGINNING TO WEAR A FORLORN FORGOTTEN LOOK A TRUMPET SOUNDED FROM THE WESTERN HEIGHTS ABOVE THE TOWN
8097-114971-0004 AS THOUGH THE SUNSET ITSELF HAD SPOKEN AND THE PEOPLE IN BEETHORPE LOOKING UP SAW THREE HORSEMEN AGAINST THE LURID SKY THREE TIMES THE TRUMPET BLEW AND THE SIMPLE FOLK OF BEETHORPE
8097-114971-0005 TUMBLING OUT INTO THE STREET AT THE SUMMONS AND LOOKING TO THE WEST WITH SLEEPY BEWILDERMENT ASKED THEMSELVES WAS IT THE LAST TRUMPET OR WAS IT THE LONG THREATENED INVASION OF THE KING OF FRANCE
8097-114971-0006 AGAIN THE TRUMPET BLEW AND THEN THE BRAVER OF THE YOUNG MEN OF THE TOWN HASTENED UP THE HILL TO LEARN ITS MEANING AS THEY APPROACHED THE HORSEMEN THEY PERCEIVED THAT THE CENTER OF THE THREE
8097-114971-0007 WAS A YOUNG MAN OF GREAT NOBILITY OF BEARING RICHLY BUT SOMBERLY DRESSED AND WITH A DARK BEAUTIFUL FACE FILLED WITH A PROUD MELANCHOLY HE KEPT HIS EYES ON THE FADING SUNSET
8097-114971-0008 WAS CLAD AFTER THE MANNER OF A STEWARD AND THE THREE HORSEMEN SAT MOTIONLESS AWAITING THE BEWILDERED AMBASSADORS OF BEETHORPE
8097-114971-0009 WHEN THESE HAD APPROACHED NEAR ENOUGH THE HERALD ONCE MORE SET THE TRUMPET TO HIS LIPS AND BLEW AND THEN UNFOLDING A PARCHMENT SCROLL READ IN A LOUD VOICE TO THE FOLK OF BEETHORPE
8097-114971-0010 WE HEREBY ISSUE PROCLAMATION THAT WHOSOEVER HATH A SORROW LET HIM OR HER BRING IT FORTH AND WE OUT OF OUR PRIVATE PURSE WILL PURCHASE THE SAID SORROW ACCORDING TO ITS VALUE
8097-114971-0011 THAT THE HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE BE LIGHTENED OF THEIR BURDENS AND WHEN THE HERALD HAD FINISHED READING HE BLEW AGAIN UPON THE TRUMPET THREE TIMES AND THE VILLAGERS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN BEWILDERMENT
8097-114971-0012 BUT SOME RAN DOWN THE HILL TO TELL THEIR NEIGHBORS OF THE STRANGE PROPOSAL OF THEIR LORD THUS PRESENTLY NEARLY ALL THE VILLAGE OF BEETHORPE WAS MAKING ITS WAY UP THE HILL TO WHERE THOSE THREE HORSEMEN LOOMED AGAINST THE EVENING SKY
8097-114971-0013 NEVER WAS SUCH A SORROWFUL COMPANY UP THE HILL THEY CAME
8097-114971-0014 NOTED A KINDLY IRONIC FLICKER OF A SMILE IN HIS EYES AS HE SAW APPARENTLY SEEING NOTHING THE POOR LITTLE RAKED UP SORROWS OF HIS VILLAGE
8097-114971-0015 HE WAS A FANTASTIC YOUNG LORD OF MANY SORROWS HIS HEART HAD BEEN BROKEN IN A VERY STRANGE WAY DEATH AND PITY WERE HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS HE WAS SO SAD HIMSELF
8097-114971-0016 THAT HE HAD COME TO REALIZE THAT SORROW IS THE ONLY SINCERITY OF LIFE THUS SORROW HAD BECOME A KIND OF PASSION WITH HIM EVEN A KIND OF CONNOISSEURSHIP AND HE HAD COME SO TO SAY
8097-114971-0017 TO BE A COLLECTOR OF SORROWS IT WAS PARTLY PITY AND PARTLY AN ODD FORM OF DILETTANTEISM FOR HIS OWN SAD HEART MADE HIM PITIFUL FOR AND COMPANIONABLE WITH ANY OTHER SAD HEART
8097-114971-0018 BUT THE SINCERITY OF HIS SORROW MADE HIM JEALOUS OF THE SANCTITY OF SORROW AND AT THE SAME TIME STERNLY CRITICAL OF AND SADLY AMUSED BY THE HYPOCRISIES OF SORROW
8097-114971-0019 SO AS HE SAT HIS HORSE AND GAZED AT THE SUNSET HE SMILED SADLY TO HIMSELF AS HE HEARD WITHOUT SEEMING TO HEAR THE SMALL INSINCERE SORROWS OF HIS VILLAGE OF BEETHORPE
8097-114971-0020 SORROWS FORGOTTEN LONG AGO BUT SUDDENLY REDISCOVERED IN OLD DRAWERS AND UNOPENED CUPBOARDS AT THE SOUND OF HIS LORDSHIP'S TRUMPET AND THE PROMISE OF HIS STRANGE PROCLAMATION
8097-114971-0021 WAS THERE A SORROW IN THE WORLD THAT NO MONEY COULD BUY IT WAS TO FIND SUCH A SORROW THAT LORD MORTIMER THUS
8097-114971-0022 FAR AND WIDE HE HAD RIDDEN OVER HIS ESTATES SEEKING SO RARE A SORROW BUT AS YET HE HAD FOUND NO SORROW THAT COULD NOT BE BOUGHT WITH A LITTLE BAG OF GOLD AND SILVER COINS
8097-114971-0023 SO HE SAT HIS HORSE WHILE THE VILLAGERS OF BEETHORPE WERE PAID OUT OF A GREAT LEATHERN BAG BY THE STEWARD FOR THE STEWARD UNDERSTOOD THE MIND OF HIS MASTER AND WITHOUT TROUBLING HIM PAID EACH WEEPING AND WHIMPERING PEASANT
8097-114971-0024 AS HE THOUGHT FIT IN ANOTHER GREAT BAG THE STEWARD HAD COLLECTED THE SORROWS OF THE VILLAGE OF BEETHORPE AND BY THIS THE MOON WAS RISING AND WITH ANOTHER BLAST OF TRUMPET BY WAY OF FAREWELL
8097-114971-0025 THE THREE HORSEMEN TOOK THE ROAD AGAIN TO LORD MORTIMER'S CASTLE WHEN OUT OF THE GREAT LEATHERN BAG IN LORD MORTIMER'S CABINET THEY POURED UPON THE TABLE THE SORROWS OF BEETHORPE
8097-114971-0026 THE YOUNG LORD SMILED TO HIMSELF TURNING OVER ONE SORROW AFTER THE OTHER AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN PRECIOUS STONES FOR THERE WAS NOT ONE GENUINE SORROW AMONG THEM BUT LATER
8097-114971-0027 THERE CAME NEWS TO HIM THAT THERE WAS ONE REAL SORROW IN BEETHORPE AND HE RODE ALONE ON HORSEBACK TO THE VILLAGE AND FOUND A BEAUTIFUL GIRL LAYING FLOWERS ON A GRAVE SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
8097-114971-0028 THAT HE FORGOT HIS ANCIENT GRIEF AND HE THOUGHT THAT ALL HIS CASTLES WOULD BE BUT A POOR EXCHANGE FOR HER FACE MAIDEN SAID HE LET ME BUY YOUR SORROW WITH THREE COUNTIES AND SEVEN CASTLES
8097-114971-0029 AND THE GIRL LOOKED UP AT HIM FROM THE GRAVE WITH EYES OF FORGET ME NOT AND SAID MY LORD YOU MISTAKE THIS IS NOT SORROW
