2407-7666-0000 LEFT THE CORDON AND WENT TOWARDS THE PLACE ON THE TEREK WHERE THEY WERE TO LIE IN AMBUSH NAZARKA DID NOT WANT TO GO AT ALL BUT LUKASHKA SHOUTED AT HIM AND THEY SOON STARTED AFTER THEY HAD GONE A FEW STEPS IN SILENCE THE COSSACKS TURNED ASIDE FROM THE DITCH
2407-7666-0001 AND WENT ALONG A PATH ALMOST HIDDEN BY REEDS TILL THEY REACHED THE RIVER ON ITS BANK LAY A THICK BLACK LOG CAST UP BY THE WATER THE REEDS AROUND IT HAD BEEN RECENTLY BEATEN DOWN SHALL WE LIE HERE ASKED NAZARKA
2407-7666-0002 SIT DOWN HERE AND I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE I'LL ONLY SHOW DADDY WHERE TO GO THIS IS THE BEST PLACE HERE WE CAN SEE AND NOT BE SEEN SAID ERGUSHOV SO IT'S HERE WE'LL LIE IT'S A FIRST RATE PLACE NAZARKA AND ERGUSHOV
2407-7666-0003 SPREAD OUT THEIR CLOAKS AND SETTLED DOWN BEHIND THE LOG WHILE LUKASHKA WENT ON WITH UNCLE EROSHKA
2407-7666-0004 SAID LUKASHKA STEPPING SOFTLY IN FRONT OF THE OLD MAN I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE THEY'VE BEEN I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS DADDY SHOW ME YOU'RE A FINE FELLOW A REGULAR SNATCHER REPLIED THE OLD MAN ALSO WHISPERING HAVING GONE A FEW STEPS LUKASHKA STOPPED
2407-7666-0005 STOOPED DOWN OVER A PUDDLE AND WHISTLED
2407-7666-0006 HE SPOKE IN A SCARCELY AUDIBLE VOICE POINTING TO FRESH HOOF PRINTS CHRIST BLESS YOU ANSWERED THE OLD MAN THE BOAR WILL BE IN THE HOLLOW BEYOND THE DITCH HE ADDED TIL WATCH AND YOU CAN GO
2407-7666-0007 LUKASHKA PULLED HIS CLOAK UP HIGHER AND WALKED BACK ALONE THROWING SWIFT GLANCES NOW TO THE LEFT AT THE WALL OF REEDS NOW TO THE TEREK RUSHING BY BELOW THE BANK I DARESAY HE'S WATCHING OR CREEPING ALONG SOMEWHERE THOUGHT HE OF A POSSIBLE CHECHEN HILLSMAN
2407-7666-0008 SUDDENLY A LOUD RUSTLING AND A SPLASH IN THE WATER MADE HIM START AND SEIZE HIS MUSKET FROM UNDER THE BANK A BOAR LEAPT UP HIS DARK OUTLINE SHOWING FOR A MOMENT AGAINST THE GLASSY SURFACE OF THE WATER AND THEN DISAPPEARING AMONG THE REEDS LUKASHKA PULLED OUT HIS GUN AND AIMED
2407-7666-0009 BUT BEFORE HE COULD FIRE THE BOAR HAD DISAPPEARED IN THE THICKET LUKASHKA SPAT WITH VEXATION AND WENT ON ON APPROACHING THE AMBUSCADE HE HALTED AGAIN AND WHISTLED SOFTLY HIS WHISTLE WAS ANSWERED
2407-7666-0010 NAZARKA ALL CURLED UP WAS ALREADY ASLEEP ERGUSHOV SAT WITH HIS LEGS CROSSED AND MOVED SLIGHTLY TO MAKE ROOM FOR LUKASHKA
2407-7666-0011 SHOWED HIM WHERE ANSWERED LUKASHKA SPREADING OUT HIS CLOAK BUT WHAT A BIG BOAR I ROUSED JUST NOW CLOSE TO THE WATER I EXPECT IT WAS THE VERY ONE YOU MUST HAVE HEARD THE CRASH I DID HEAR A BEAST CRASHING THROUGH I KNEW AT ONCE IT WAS A BEAST I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
2407-7666-0012 LUKASHKA HAS ROUSED A BEAST ERGUSHOV SAID WRAPPING HIMSELF UP IN HIS CLOAK
2407-7666-0013 WE MUST HAVE DISCIPLINE I'LL LIE DOWN AND HAVE A NAP AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE A NAP AND I'LL WATCH THAT'S THE WAY
2407-7666-0014 THE NIGHT WAS DARK WARM AND STILL ONLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE SKY THE STARS WERE SHINING THE OTHER AND GREATER PART WAS OVERCAST BY ONE HUGE CLOUD STRETCHING FROM THE MOUNTAINTOPS THE BLACK CLOUD
2407-7666-0015 BLENDING IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY WIND WITH THE MOUNTAINS MOVED SLOWLY ONWARDS ITS CURVED EDGES SHARPLY DENNED AGAINST THE DEEP STARRY SKY ONLY IN FRONT OF HIM COULD THE COSSACK DISCERN THE TEREK AND THE DISTANCE BEYOND
2407-7666-0016 OCCASIONALLY THE REEDS WOULD SWAY AND RUSTLE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER APPARENTLY WITHOUT CAUSE SEEN FROM DOWN BELOW AGAINST THE CLEAR PART OF THE SKY THEIR WAVING TUFTS LOOKED LIKE THE FEATHERY BRANCHES OF TREES
2407-7666-0017 CLOSE IN FRONT AT HIS VERY FEET WAS THE BANK AND AT ITS BASE THE RUSHING TORRENT A LITTLE FARTHER ON WAS THE MOVING MASS OF GLASSY BROWN WATER WHICH EDDIED RHYTHMICALLY ALONG THE BANK AND ROUND THE SHALLOWS FARTHER STILL WATER
2407-7666-0018 BANKS AND CLOUD ALL MERGED TOGETHER IN IMPENETRABLE GLOOM
2407-7666-0019 IN WHICH THE EXPERIENCED EYES OF THE COSSACK DETECTED TREES CARRIED DOWN BY THE CURRENT ONLY VERY RARELY SHEET LIGHTNING MIRRORED IN THE WATER AS IN A BLACK GLASS DISCLOSED THE SLOPING BANK OPPOSITE THE RHYTHMIC SOUNDS OF NIGHT
2407-7666-0020 THE RUSTLING OF THE REEDS THE SNORING OF THE COSSACKS THE HUM OF MOSQUITOES AND THE RUSHING WATER
2407-7666-0021 OR THE CRASHING OF AN ANIMAL BREAKING THROUGH THE THICK UNDERGROWTH IN THE WOOD ONCE AN OWL FLEW PAST ALONG THE TEREK FLAPPING ONE WING AGAINST THE OTHER RHYTHMICALLY AT EVERY SECOND BEAT JUST ABOVE THE COSSACK'S HEAD IT TURNED TOWARDS THE WOOD AND THEN
2407-7666-0022 STRIKING ITS WINGS NO LONGER AFTER EVERY OTHER FLAP BUT AT EVERY FLAP IT FLEW TO AN OLD PLANE TREE WHERE IT RUSTLED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE SETTLING DOWN AMONG THE BRANCHES AT EVERY ONE OF THESE UNEXPECTED SOUNDS
2407-7666-0023 THE WATCHING COSSACK LISTENED INTENTLY STRAINING HIS HEARING AND SCREWING UP HIS EYES WHILE HE DELIBERATELY FELT FOR HIS MUSKET THE GREATER PART OF THE NIGHT WAS PAST THE BLACK CLOUD THAT HAD MOVED WESTWARD REVEALED THE CLEAR STARRY SKY FROM UNDER ITS TORN EDGE
2407-7666-0024 AND THE GOLDEN UPTURNED CRESCENT OF THE MOON SHONE ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS WITH A REDDISH LIGHT THE COLD BEGAN TO BE PENETRATING NAZARKA AWOKE SPOKE A LITTLE AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN LUKASHKA FEELING BORED GOT UP
2407-7666-0025 DREW THE KNIFE FROM HIS DAGGER HANDLE AND BEGAN TO FASHION HIS STICK INTO A RAMROD HIS HEAD WAS FULL OF THE CHECHENS WHO LIVED OVER THERE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND OF HOW THEIR BRAVE LADS CAME ACROSS AND WERE NOT AFRAID OF THE COSSACKS AND MIGHT EVEN NOW BE CROSSING THE RIVER AT SOME OTHER SPOT
2407-7666-0026 HE THRUST HIMSELF OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE AND LOOKED ALONG THE RIVER BUT COULD SEE NOTHING AND AS HE CONTINUED LOOKING OUT AT INTERVALS UPON THE RIVER AND AT THE OPPOSITE BANK NOW DIMLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE WATER IN THE FAINT MOONLIGHT
2407-7666-0027 HE NO LONGER THOUGHT ABOUT THE CHECHENS BUT ONLY OF WHEN IT WOULD BE TIME TO WAKE HIS COMRADES AND OF GOING HOME TO THE VILLAGE IN THE VILLAGE HE IMAGINED DUNAYKA HIS LITTLE SOUL AS THE COSSACKS CALL A MAN'S MISTRESS AND THOUGHT OF HER WITH VEXATION
2407-7666-0028 SILVERY MISTS A SIGN OF COMING MORNING GLITTERED WHITE ABOVE THE WATER AND NOT FAR FROM HIM YOUNG EAGLES WERE WHISTLING AND FLAPPING THEIR WINGS AT LAST THE CROWING OF A COCK REACHED HIM FROM THE DISTANT VILLAGE FOLLOWED BY THE LONG SUSTAINED NOTE OF ANOTHER
2407-7666-0029 TIME TO WAKE THEM THOUGHT LUKASHKA WHO HAD FINISHED HIS RAMROD AND FELT HIS EYES GROWING HEAVY TURNING TO HIS COMRADES HE MANAGED TO MAKE OUT WHICH PAIR OF LEGS BELONGED TO WHOM
2407-7666-0030 HE TURNED AGAIN TOWARDS THE HORIZON BEYOND THE HILLS WHERE DAY WAS BREAKING UNDER THE UPTURNED CRESCENT GLANCED AT THE OUTLINE OF THE OPPOSITE BANK AT THE TEREK AND AT THE NOW DISTINCTLY VISIBLE DRIFTWOOD UPON IT FOR ONE INSTANT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS MOVING
2407-7666-0031 AND THAT THE TEREK WITH THE DRIFTING WOOD REMAINED STATIONARY AGAIN HE PEERED OUT ONE LARGE BLACK LOG WITH A BRANCH PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION THE TREE WAS FLOATING IN A STRANGE WAY RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM NEITHER ROCKING NOR WHIRLING
2407-7666-0032 IT EVEN APPEARED NOT TO BE FLOATING ALTOGETHER WITH THE CURRENT BUT TO BE CROSSING IT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SHALLOWS LUKASHKA STRETCHING OUT HIS NECK WATCHED IT INTENTLY THE TREE FLOATED TO THE SHALLOWS STOPPED AND SHIFTED IN A PECULIAR MANNER
2407-7666-0033 LUKASHKA THOUGHT HE SAW AN ARM STRETCHED OUT FROM BENEATH THE TREE SUPPOSING I KILLED AN ABREK ALL BY MYSELF HE THOUGHT AND SEIZED HIS GUN WITH A SWIFT UNHURRIED MOVEMENT PUTTING UP HIS GUN REST PLACING THE GUN UPON IT
2407-7666-0034 AND HOLDING IT NOISELESSLY IN POSITION COCKING THE TRIGGER WITH BATED BREATH HE TOOK AIM STILL PEERING OUT INTENTLY I WON'T WAKE THEM HE THOUGHT
2407-7666-0035 BUT HIS HEART BEGAN BEATING SO FAST THAT HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS LISTENING SUDDENLY THE TRUNK GAVE A PLUNGE AND AGAIN BEGAN TO FLOAT ACROSS THE STREAM TOWARDS OUR BANK
2407-7666-0036 AND NOW BY THE FAINT LIGHT OF THE MOON HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A TARTAR'S HEAD IN FRONT OF THE FLOATING WOOD HE AIMED STRAIGHT AT THE HEAD WHICH APPEARED TO BE QUITE NEAR JUST AT THE END OF HIS RIFLE'S BARREL HE GLANCED CROSS
2407-7666-0037 RIGHT ENOUGH IT IS AN ABREK HE THOUGHT JOYFULLY AND SUDDENLY RISING TO HIS KNEES HE AGAIN TOOK AIM
2407-7666-0038 IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON IN THE COSSACK WAY LEARNT IN HIS CHILDHOOD AND PULLED THE TRIGGER A FLASH OF LIGHTNING LIT UP FOR AN INSTANT THE REEDS AND THE WATER AND THE SHARP
2407-7666-0039 THE PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD NOW FLOATED NOT ACROSS BUT WITH THE CURRENT ROCKING AND WHIRLING STOP I SAY EXCLAIMED ERGUSHOV SEIZING HIS MUSKET
2407-7666-0040 WHISPERED LUKASHKA GRINDING HIS TEETH ABREKS WHOM HAVE YOU SHOT ASKED NAZARKA WHO WAS IT LUKASHKA LUKASHKA DID NOT ANSWER HE WAS RELOADING HIS GUN AND WATCHING THE FLOATING WOOD A LITTLE WAY OFF IT STOPPED ON A SAND BANK
2407-7666-0041 AND FROM BEHIND IT SOMETHING LARGE THAT ROCKED IN THE WATER CAME INTO VIEW WHAT DID YOU SHOOT WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK INSISTED THE COSSACKS ABREKS I TELL YOU SAID LUKASHKA DON'T HUMBUG DID THE GUN GO OFF
2407-7666-0042 I'VE KILLED AN ABREK THAT'S WHAT I FIRED AT MUTTERED LUKASHKA IN A VOICE CHOKED BY EMOTION AS HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET A MAN WAS SWIMMING HE SAID POINTING TO THE SANDBANK
2407-7666-0043 LOOK THERE SAID LUKASHKA SEIZING HIM BY THE SHOULDERS AND PULLING HIM WITH SUCH FORCE THAT ERGUSHOV GROANED HE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH LUKASHKA POINTED AND DISCERNING A BODY IMMEDIATELY CHANGED HIS TONE O LORD BUT I SAY MORE WILL COME I TELL YOU THE TRUTH
2407-7666-0044 SAID HE SOFTLY AND BEGAN EXAMINING HIS MUSKET THAT WAS A SCOUT SWIMMING ACROSS EITHER THE OTHERS ARE HERE ALREADY OR ARE NOT FAR OFF ON THE OTHER SIDE I TELL YOU FOR SURE LUKASHKA WAS UNFASTENING HIS BELT AND TAKING OFF HIS CIRCASSIAN COAT
2407-7666-0045 WHAT ARE YOU UP TO YOU IDIOT EXCLAIMED ERGUSHOV ONLY SHOW YOURSELF AND YOU'VE LOST ALL FOR NOTHING I TELL YOU TRUE IF YOU'VE KILLED HIM HE WON'T ESCAPE LET ME HAVE A LITTLE POWDER FOR MY MUSKET PAN YOU HAVE SOME
2407-7666-0046 CATCH ME GOING ALONE GO YOURSELF SAID NAZARKA ANGRILY HAVING TAKEN OFF HIS COAT LUKASHKA WENT DOWN TO THE BANK DON'T GO IN I TELL YOU SAID ERGUSHOV PUTTING SOME POWDER ON THE PAN LOOK HE'S NOT MOVING I CAN SEE IT'S NEARLY MORNING WAIT TILL THEY COME FROM THE CORDON
2407-7666-0047 YOU GO NAZARKA YOU'RE AFRAID DON'T BE AFRAID I TELL YOU LUKE I SAY LUKASHKA TELL US HOW YOU DID IT SAID NAZARKA LUKASHKA CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT GOING INTO THE WATER JUST THEN GO QUICK TO THE CORDON AND I WILL WATCH
2407-7666-0048 TELL THE COSSACKS TO SEND OUT THE PATROL IF THE ABREKS ARE ON THIS SIDE THEY MUST BE CAUGHT SAID HE THAT'S WHAT I SAY THEY'LL GET OFF SAID ERGUSHOV RISING TRUE THEY MUST BE CAUGHT ERGUSHOV AND NAZARKA ROSE AND CROSSING THEMSELVES
2407-7666-0049 STARTED OFF FOR THE CORDON NOT ALONG THE RIVERBANK BUT BREAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE BRAMBLES TO REACH A PATH IN THE WOOD NOW MIND LUKASHKA THEY MAY CUT YOU DOWN HERE SO YOU'D BEST KEEP A SHARP LOOK OUT I TELL YOU
2407-7666-0050 GO ALONG I KNOW MUTTERED LUKASHKA AND HAVING EXAMINED HIS GUN AGAIN HE SAT DOWN BEHIND THE LOG HE REMAINED ALONE AND SAT GAZING AT THE SHALLOWS AND LISTENING FOR THE COSSACKS BUT IT WAS SOME DISTANCE TO THE CORDON AND HE WAS TORMENTED BY IMPATIENCE
2407-7666-0051 HE KEPT THINKING THAT THE OTHER ABREKS WHO WERE WITH THE ONE HE HAD KILLED WOULD ESCAPE HE WAS VEXED WITH THE ABREKS WHO WERE GOING TO ESCAPE
