2979-156237-0000 THE MEDIUM WAS A THIN NERVOUS LOOKING YOUTH OF ABOUT NINETEEN BUT AS MISTER DEMPSTER ASSURED MISTER HOGARTH WAS IN EVERY WAY TO BE TRUSTED AS HIS CHARACTER WAS IRREPROACHABLE AND OF GREAT SINCERITY AND SIMPLICITY
2979-156237-0001 BEING CAUSED BY SPIRITUAL AGENCY AND THOUGH HE COULD
2979-156237-0002 AS EVERY UNBELIEVER ALWAYS FEELS AT FIRST BUT THE EAGERNESS OF THE LARGE PARTY WHO WERE GATHERED TOGETHER HAD SOMETHING INFECTIOUS IN IT MANY OF THEM HAD KNOWN SEVERE BEREAVEMENT
2979-156237-0003 AND THE BRIEF MESSAGES COMMUNICATED BY RAPS OR BY THE VOICE OF THE MEDIUM GAVE THEM CONSOLATION AND HOPE TO FRANCIS THE DETAILS COMMUNICATED APPEARED TO BE MEAGRE AND UNSATISFACTORY THE SPIRITS ALL SAID THAT THEY WERE HAPPY
2979-156237-0004 WHICH TO SOME PRESENT WAS A FACT OF INESTIMABLE VALUE BUT TO HIM IT WAS A MATTER OF COURSE HE NEVER HAD BELIEVED SINCE HE HAD THOUGHT OUT THE SUBJECT IN EARLY MANHOOD THAT GOD WOULD CONTINUE EXISTENCE IF HE DID NOT MAKE IT A BLESSING
2979-156237-0005 BUT TO OTHERS WHO LIKE MANY BEFORE HIM HAD INTELLIGENTLY ACCEPTED OF A STERNER THEOLOGY AND WHO HAD BEEN STRUGGLING THROUGH YEARS OF CHAOTIC DOUBTS AND FANCIES FOR FOOTING ON WHICH TO REST HE SAW THAT THESE ASSURANCES GAVE REAL STRENGTH AND SUPPORT
2979-156237-0006 AN HOUR HAD PASSED AMIDST THESE MANIFESTATIONS THE INTEREST OF THE BELIEVERS CONTINUED TO BE UNFLAGGING BUT FRANCIS FELT A LITTLE TIRED OF IT HE HAD LOST NO DEAR FRIEND BY DEATH
2979-156237-0007 THE DEAREST BEINGS IN THE WORLD TO HIM WERE HIS TWO COUSINS AND THEY WERE DIVIDED FROM HIM BY CIRCUMSTANCES ALMOST AS CRUEL AS THE GRAVE HOW FEW HAVE DONE JUSTICE TO THE SAD PARTINGS THE MOURNFUL ALIENATIONS
2979-156237-0008 BEREAVEMENT IN ALL ITS VARIED BITTERNESS HAS BEEN SUNG BY MANY POETS IN STRAINS WORTHY OF THE SUBJECT BUT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SO INSIDIOUS AND OFTEN SO PROSAIC THAT THEIR TRAGICAL OPERATION HAS BEEN RARELY TREATED OF IN VERSE
2979-156237-0009 HIS THOUGHTS RECURRED AS THEY ALWAYS DID WHEN HE FELT SAD OR SERIOUS TO JANE MELVILLE TO THE WILL THAT HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AND AT THE SAME TIME SO CRUELLY PARTED THEM TO THE UNKNOWN FATHER WHOSE OWN LIFE HAD BEEN BLIGHTED BY THE LOSS
2979-156237-0010 OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS DEALING SO FATAL A BLOW TO THE SON WHOM HE MEANT TO BLESS AND REWARD BY PLACING HIM IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE HE COULD NOT HELP LOVING JANE AND FORBIDDING SO FAR AS HE COULD FORBID THE MARRIAGE OF TWO SOULS MADE FOR ONE ANOTHER
2979-156237-0011 FRANCIS WAS WONDERING IF HIS FATHER NOW SAW THE MISTAKE HE HAD COMMITTED OR REGRETTED IT WHEN HE WAS STARTLED BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HIS FATHER WAS IN THE ROOM AND WISHED TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM
2979-156237-0012 STARTING UP INCREDULOUSLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOMEWHAT AWED BY THE MERE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH A ONE WAS THERE OUT OF THE BODY OWNING HIM AS HIS SON WHICH HE HAD NOT DONE WHILE HE WAS ALIVE DOES THE SPIRIT MEAN TO COMMUNICATE BY RAPS OR THROUGH THE MEDIUM
2979-156237-0013 ASKED MISTER DEMPSTER BY RAPS WAS THE ANSWER GIVEN TAKE THE ALPHABET IN YOUR OWN HAND SAID MISTER DEMPSTER AND ASK THE SPIRIT HIS NAME AND THEN PASS YOUR FINGER OVER THE ALPHABET THE RAP WILL ARREST YOU AT THE RIGHT LETTER
2979-156237-0014 FRANCIS PASSED HIS FINGER ALONG THE ALPHABET HALF DISDAINFULLY HALF IN CURIOSITY THE RAP STOPPED HIM AT THE LETTER H HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT THE CURIOUS LITTLE TAPS SOUNDED SO UNEARTHLY BEFORE
2979-156237-0015 NEXT HE WAS STOPPED AT E THEN AT N THEN AT R AND NEXT AT Y AND SO ON TILL THE FULL NAME OF HENRY HOGARTH WAS SPELLED OUT YOU WISH TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME THEN YOU LOVE ME NOW
2979-156237-0016 THE THREE QUICK RAPS MEANING YES WAS THE IMMEDIATE REPLY ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE AT CROSS HALL SINCE YOUR DEATH AGAIN THE ALPHABET WAS CALLED FOR AND THE RAPS SPELLED OUT VERY MUCH PLEASED ARE YOU SORRY FOR THE WILL YOU MADE
2979-156237-0017 ALL WILL BE WELL IN THE END WAS SPELLED OUT DID YOU SEE YOUR NIECES SUFFERINGS UNMOVED THEIR POVERTY THEIR DISAPPOINTMENTS THEIR UNFITNESS FOR THE WORK THAT YOU HAD SET THEM TO DO THEY ARE BETTER FOR WHAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED WAS SPELLED OUT
2979-156237-0018 AND YOU TOO DOES THE LETTER IN MY POCKET COME FROM MY MOTHER THE THREE RAPS REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE DID YOU GIVE HER AN ANNUITY AS SHE SAYS YOU DID A SINGLE RAP MEANING NO WAS THE REPLY
2979-156237-0019 WHAT DID YOU GIVE HER THEN TO MAKE HER FOREGO HER CLAIMS ON YOU A SUM OF MONEY WAS THE REPLY FRANCIS OBSERVED A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THE CHARACTER OF THE RAPS PROCEEDING FROM MISTER HOGARTH FROM THOSE OF THE SPIRIT LAST SUMMONED
2979-156237-0020 WHICH HAD BEEN SUPPOSED TO BE THAT OF MISTER DEMPSTER'S ELDEST DAUGHTER WHO HAD DIED AT SIXTEEN AND OF A LINGERING DISEASE THE LATTER WERE FAINT AND ALMOST INAUDIBLE TO AN UNPRACTISED EAR WHILE THOSE OF HIS FATHER WERE FIRM AND DISTINCT
2979-156237-0021 THERE WAS NEVER ANY POWER OF KNOWING FROM WHAT PART OF THE ROOM THE RAPS WOULD COME AND AS ANSWER AFTER ANSWER APPEARED TO COME SO READILY TO HIS QUESTIONS
2979-156237-0022 ADVISE ME MY FATHER TELL ME WHAT TO DO IF YOU SEE MORE AND KNOW THAN MORE I CAN DO SHOULD I ASSIST MY MOTHER AS SHE ASKS ME TO DO THE SINGLE IMPATIENT RAP MEANING NO WAS THE IMMEDIATE REPLY
2979-156237-0023 CAN I EVER HAVE WHAT I MOST DESIRE IN THE WORLD YOU PROMISE IMPROVEMENT I WANT HAPPINESS SAID FRANCIS PASSIONATELY
2979-156237-0024 AS TO WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF HIM PATIENCE I WATCH OVER YOU WAS THE REPLY WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD I AM LEARNING ANSWERED THE SPIRIT FROM ONE WHO LOVES ME WHAT IS HER NAME ASKED FRANCIS
2979-156237-0025 THE ALPHABET WAS IN HIS HANDS HE WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO LET ANY SIGN OF HIS GIVE ANY CLUE IN CASE OF ITS BEING ALL IMPOSTURE AND EXTRAORDINARY QUICKNESS OF SIGHT HE PURPOSELY PASSED OVER THE LETTERS BUT WAS RAPPED BACK BY THE RECOGNISED SIGNAL
2979-156237-0026 TILL THE NAME MARGUERITE WAS SPELLED OUT
2979-156237-0027 YOU THINK ALL IS WELL IN THE END YOU HAVE MET MARGUERITE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD AFTER BEING SEPARATED FOR A LIFETIME IN THIS AND THIS IS VERY SWEET TO YOU BUT I WANT JANE NOW TO HELP ME TO LIVE WORTHILY CAN I WIN HER IN THIS LIFE
2979-156237-0028 AFTER A TIME SAID THE SPIRIT RAPPING BY THE ALPHABET THIS ANSWER TO HIS INAUDIBLE QUESTION YOU THEN CAN ANSWER MENTAL QUESTIONS THOUGHT FRANCIS WHAT CONNECTION CAN MISTER PHILLIPS POSSIBLY HAVE WITH MISSUS PECK OR RATHER ELIZABETH HOGARTH
2979-156237-0029 BUT TO THIS INAUDIBLE QUESTION THE SPIRIT MADE NO REPLY AND TOLD HIM THROUGH THE MEDIUM THAT HE WAS DISINCLINED FOR ANY FURTHER COMMUNICATION CERTAINLY IT WAS A QUESTION WHICH HE FELT CONSCIOUS HE HAD NO RIGHT TO PUT AFTER WHAT MISTER PHILLIPS HAD SAID TO HIM
2979-156237-0030 THE SPIRIT WAS IN THE RIGHT NOT TO ANSWER IT ARE YOU CONVINCED SAID MISTER DEMPSTER WHO HAD SEEN THE SURPRISE WITH WHICH MISTER HOGARTH HAD SPELLED OUT THE ANSWERS I AM STAGGERED SAID FRANCIS
2979-156237-0031 THE GENERAL ANSWERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN GIVEN AT RANDOM BUT THE NAMES I AM CONVINCED WERE UNKNOWN TO EVERY ONE HERE EXCEPT MYSELF
2979-156237-0032 I HAVE ASKED SOME QUESTIONS AS TO THE FUTURE SAID FRANCIS I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS ALLOWABLE TO DO SO DO YOUR SPIRITS CLAIM TO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS TO COME OH YES THEY DO THOSE OF THE HIGHEST CLASS IN PARTICULAR SAID MISTER DEMPSTER
2979-156237-0033 I DO NOT SEE HOW THEY CAN SAID FRANCIS MUSINGLY TO KNOW THE FUTURE IS A PREROGATIVE OF OMNISCIENCE AND EVEN THE HIGHEST CREATED INTELLIGENCE CANNOT TELL WHAT HIS PURPOSES MAY BE
2979-156237-0034 HOW DO WE GUESS AT THE FUTURE WITH SUFFICIENT ACCURACY TO DIRECT US IN THE PRESENT BUT BY GENERALIZATION FROM EXPERIENCE
2979-156237-0035 SEES MORE INTO OTHER SOULS AND THEIR WORKINGS THAN WE CAN POSSIBLY DO WHILE ENCUMBERED WITH THESE ROBES OF CLAY AND CONSEQUENTLY CAN MAKE A JUSTER GENERALIZATION SAID MISTER DEMPSTER BUT NOT AN INFALLIBLE ONE SAID FRANCIS
2979-156237-0036 BUT AS TO THE PRESENT THEIR VIEWS ARE SURE TO BE CORRECT SAID FRANCIS IF THEY ARE GOOD SPIRITS AND NOT LYING SPIRITS WE PRAYED AGAINST THEIR APPEARANCE AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE SPIRIT
2979-156237-0037 WHO HAS BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH YOU WAS OF THAT KIND SAID MISTER DEMPSTER HOW THEN DO YOU JUDGE BETWEEN LYING SPIRITS AND TRUE ONES ASKED FRANCIS BY THE NATURE OF THEIR COMMUNICATIONS
2979-156237-0038 CANNOT BE DELIVERED BY A GOOD SPIRIT THEN YOU STILL CONTINUE TO BE THE JUDGES OF THE SPIRITS YOU DO NOT BOW YOUR MORALITY TO THEIRS YOU SELECT AND REJECT AS YOU SEE GOOD MORALITY IS UNIVERSAL AND ETERNAL
2979-156237-0039 SAID MISTER DEMPSTER EVEN GOD HIMSELF CANNOT MAKE EVIL GOOD OR GOOD EVIL
2979-156237-0040 THEN HAVE THESE MANIFESTATIONS TAUGHT YOU ANYTHING THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE LEARNED ASKED FRANCIS THEY HAVE TAUGHT ME MUCH THAT I COULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE LEARNED I CANNOT SAY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE MAY ATTAIN
2979-156237-0041 TO THROUGH PURE REASON OR THROUGH A SIMPLE FAITH IN THE REVEALED WILL OF GOD THERE ARE DIVERSITIES OF ADMINISTRATION BUT THE SAME SPIRIT SAID MISTER DEMPSTER WITH A SIMPLE EARNESTNESS THAT WEIGHED MUCH WITH FRANCIS
2979-156237-0042 BUT HERE MISTER DEMPSTER'S ATTENTION WAS CALLED TO A MESSAGE FROM AN OLD FRIEND WHO HAD JUST DIED
2979-156237-0043 THESE RAPS WERE STILL STRONGER THAN THOSE OF MISTER HOGARTH BEING VIOLENT AND FOLLOWING IMMEDIATELY ON THE QUESTION WHEREVER A NEGATIVE OR AFFIRMATIVE WAS USED MISTER DEMPSTER SAID HE HAD BEEN A POWERFUL YOUNG MAN
2979-156237-0044 OF THE MOST UNQUESTIONABLE DETERMINATION AND THAT THE RAPS WERE ALWAYS CONSONANT TO THE CHARACTER OF THE SPIRIT WHEN IN LIFE
2979-156237-0045 THE DATE OF HIS DEATH THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAD EXISTED WITHOUT FOOD AND WATER AND THE CLOTHES HE HAD ON WHEN HE DIED
2979-156237-0046 WHO HAD SO LONG MOURNED FOR HER YOUNGEST BORN THAT HE WAS EXPECTING HER SOON TO JOIN HIM IN THE SPIRIT LAND THE PLACE WHERE THE OLD LADY LIVED WAS MENTIONED AND HER STATE OF HEALTH WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING BAD ALL PERFECTLY TRUE PERFECTLY TRUE MISTER HOGARTH
2979-156237-0047 HIS WAS A DISTRESSING FATE I EXPECTED THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING GOOD IN MANIFESTATIONS THIS EVENING BUT I SCARCELY LOOKED FOR ANYTHING SO PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY AS THIS EVERY NAME AND EVERY DATE EXACTLY CORRECT ARE YOU NOT CONVINCED NOW
2979-156237-0048 I AM CERTAINLY VERY MUCH STAGGERED SAID FRANCIS
2979-156237-0049 I OFTEN THINK OF HIS SOLITARY DEATH HAVE YOU HEARD THAT HIS MOTHER IS IN BAD HEALTH
2979-156237-0050 AND YOU HEARD HER AGE BUT WE MUST MAKE A NOTE OF THE DATE AND ASCERTAIN IF SHE IS PARTICULARLY WORSE TO NIGHT I FEEL SURE THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY DAYS OF THIS EARTH FOR HER AND HOW BLESSED A THING IT IS
2979-156237-0051 WHEN FRANCIS GOT INTO THE OPEN AIR AFTER THE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENING
2979-156237-0052 THE DIFFICULTY AND ALMOST THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ANY CHEAT OR COLLUSION AND THE APPARENT SINCERITY OF ALL WHO HAD BEEN SITTING BY HIM DURING THE MANIFESTATIONS INCREASED THE BEWILDERMENT OF HIS MIND
