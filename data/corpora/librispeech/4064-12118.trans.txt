4064-12118-0000 KATE ON LEAVING HER CARRIAGE DIRECTED THE DRIVER TO GO BACK TO THE PINES TO AWAIT MISTER BRITTON'S RETURN AND BRING HIM IMMEDIATELY TO THE OFFICE SHE THEN UNLOCKED THE DOOR TO THE ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN DARRELL'S OFFICE AND WHICH OPENED DIRECTLY UPON THE STREET
4064-12118-0001 AND SHE AND HER COMPANION ENTERED AND SEATED THEMSELVES IN THE DARKNESS THE ROOM NEXT ADJOINING WAS WALCOTT'S PRIVATE OFFICE AND BEYOND THAT WAS MISTER UNDERWOOD'S PRIVATE OFFICE THE TWO LATTER ROOMS BEING SEPARATED BY A SMALL ENTRANCE
4064-12118-0002 THEY HAD WAITED BUT A FEW MOMENTS WHEN MISTER UNDERWOOD'S CARRIAGE STOPPED BEFORE THIS ENTRANCE AND AN INSTANT LATER KATE HEARD HER FATHER'S VOICE DIRECTING THE COACHMAN TO CALL FOR HIM IN ABOUT AN HOUR AS THE KEY TURNED IN THE LOCK SHE HEARD WALCOTT'S VOICE ALSO
4064-12118-0003 THE TWO MEN ENTERED AND WENT AT ONCE INTO MISTER UNDERWOOD'S PRIVATE OFFICE MISTER UNDERWOOD IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO BUSINESS IN HIS USUAL ABRUPT FASHION MISTER WALCOTT THERE IS NO USE DALLYING OR BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH
4064-12118-0004 I WANT THIS PARTNERSHIP TERMINATED AT ONCE THERE'S NO USE IN AN HONEST MAN AND A THIEF TRYING TO DO BUSINESS TOGETHER AND THIS INTERVIEW TO NIGHT IS TO FIND THE SHORTEST WAY OF DISSOLVING THE PARTNERSHIP
4064-12118-0005 I THINK THAT CAN BE VERY EASILY AND QUICKLY DONE MISTER UNDERWOOD WALCOTT REPLIED KATE WHO HAD STATIONED HERSELF IN THE ENTRANCE WHERE SHE HAD A VIEW OF BOTH MEN SAW THE CRUEL LEER THAT ACCOMPANIED WALCOTT'S WORDS
4064-12118-0006 THE GLEAM OF THE WEAPON NOW PARTIALLY CONCEALED BY THE FOLDS OF HER SKIRT WITH NOISELESS CAT LIKE STEP SHE APPROACHED KATE AND TOUCHED HER ARM YOU WILL NOT SHOOT YOU WILL NOT KILL HIM
4064-12118-0007 SHE BREATHED RATHER THAN WHISPERED KATE'S ONLY REPLY WAS TO LAY HER FINGER ON HER LIPS NEVER REMOVING HER EYES FROM WALCOTT'S FACE BUT EVEN THEN IN HER ABSORPTION SHE NOTED A PECULIAR QUALITY IN THOSE SCARCELY AUDIBLE TONES
4064-12118-0008 OF THE WHOLESALE ROBBERY THE PLANS FOR WHICH WALCOTT HAD SO NEARLY PERFECTED HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AS WALCOTT LISTENED THE SNEER ON HIS FACE DEEPENED
4064-12118-0009 YOU SEEM TO HAVE GONE TO A VAST AMOUNT OF LABOR FOR NOTHING HE REMARKED AS MISTER UNDERWOOD CONCLUDED I COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU THAT MUCH INFORMATION OFF HAND YOU HAVE NOT LIVED UP TO YOUR PART OF THE CONTRACT
4064-12118-0010 AND I SEE NO REASON WHY I SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO FULFIL MINE YOU PROMISED ME YOUR DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE AND THEN SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE SAW FIT WE WILL LEAVE MY DAUGHTER'S NAME OUT OF THIS CONTROVERSY SIR MISTER UNDERWOOD INTERPOSED STERNLY
4064-12118-0011 WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT YOUR NAME HAS BEEN PUBLICLY ASSOCIATED WITH HERS I WOULD PROSECUTE YOU FOR THE SCOUNDREL AND BLACK LEG THAT YOU ARE BUT FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR DAUGHTER'S NAME YOU INTEND TO DEAL LENIENTLY WITH ME WALCOTT SNEERED
4064-12118-0012 SUPPOSING WE COME AT ONCE TO THE POINT OF DISSOLVING OUR PARTNERSHIP IT CANNOT BE DONE ANY TOO QUICKLY FOR ME MAY I INQUIRE ON WHAT TERMS YOU PROPOSE TO SETTLE
4064-12118-0013 MISTER UNDERWOOD WENT BRIEFLY OVER THE TERMS WHICH HE HAD OUTLINED ON A SHEET OF PAPER BEFORE HIM ON HIS DESK WALCOTT SEATED EIGHT OR TEN FEET DISTANT LISTENED HIS DARK FACE PALING WITH ANGER
4064-12118-0014 BEFORE HE HAD COVERED HALF THE SPACE HOWEVER A VOICE RANG THROUGH THE ROOM WITH STARTLING CLEARNESS NOT A STEP FARTHER OR YOU ARE A DEAD MAN
4064-12118-0015 HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND THE HAND JUST WITHDRAWN FROM HIS COAT DISCLOSED TO VIEW A TINY GLITTERING STILETTO KATE'S ONLY ANXIOUS THOUGHT WAS FOR HER FATHER WHO TOO BEWILDERED TO MOVE OR SPEAK
4064-12118-0016 I AM ALL RIGHT SHE CRIED BRIGHTLY LOOK AFTER PAPA FIRST THEN WE WILL ATTEND TO THIS CREATURE WITH THE REVOLVER STILL LEVELLED AT WALCOTT KATE SLOWLY ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM GIVE ME THAT WEAPON SHE DEMANDED
4064-12118-0017 HE GAVE A SINISTER SMILE BUT BEFORE SHE HAD TAKEN ANOTHER STEP HER COMPANION SPRANG INTO THE ROOM WITH A PIERCING CRY AND INTERCEPTED HER NO NO SENORITA SHE EXCLAIMED DO NOT TOUCH IT MOTHER OF GOD IT IS POISONED
4064-12118-0018 A SINGLE SCRATCH MEANS DEATH AT SIGHT OF HER WALCOTT'S FACE GREW LIVID YOU FIEND YOU SHE DEVIL HE HISSED THIS IS YOUR DOING IS IT AND HE BURST INTO A TORRENT OF CURSES AND IMPRECATIONS
4064-12118-0019 BE SILENT MISTER BRITTON ORDERED STERNLY AND KATE ACCOMPANIED THE COMMAND WITH AN OMINOUS CLICK OF HER REVOLVER
4064-12118-0020 AS SHE EXTENDED HER HAND SHE TAUNTINGLY HELD HER WRIST CLOSE TO THE TINY POINT SCARCELY LARGER THAN A GOOD SIZED PIN LIFE AND FREEDOM ARE PRECIOUS SENOR SHE SAID IN LOW MOCKING TONES
4064-12118-0021 AS SHE TOOK THE WEAPON FROM HIM AND HANDED IT TO MISTER BRITTON WHO LAID IT CAREFULLY ON A TABLE NEAR BY AND THEN PROCEEDED TO SEARCH WALCOTT'S CLOTHING SAYING
4064-12118-0022 TO THE STILETTO ALREADY PLACED UPON THE TABLE WERE ADDED ANOTHER OF LARGER SIZE TWO LOADED REVOLVERS SEVERAL PACKAGES OF VALUABLE SECURITIES TAKEN FROM THE VAULTS OF THE FIRM THAT AFTERNOON
4064-12118-0023 AND A NEARLY COMPLETE SET OF DUPLICATE KEYS TO THE SAFES AND DEPOSIT BOXES OF THE OFFICES MISTER BRITTON THEN RELIEVED KATE CONGRATULATING HER WARMLY AND STATIONED HIMSELF NEAR WALCOTT WHO GLOWERED LIKE A WILD BEAST THAT
4064-12118-0024 AND SHE SAVED ME FROM WORSE THAN DEATH IN PREVENTING THE CARRYING OUT OF THE FARCE OF AN ILLEGAL MARRIAGE WITH THAT VILLAIN BY GIVING ME A GLIMPSE OF HIS REAL CHARACTER BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE
4064-12118-0025 THE CHANGE THAT PASSED OVER MISTER UNDERWOOD'S COUNTENANCE DURING KATE'S WORDS WAS FEARFUL TO SEE
4064-12118-0026 AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE THAT NO ONE PRESENT HAD EVER HEARD THERE BEFORE ILLEGAL PAPA BECAUSE THIS WOMAN IS HIS LAWFUL WIFE AND KATE GAVE A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE SITUATION IS THAT SO HE APPEALED TO THE WOMAN
4064-12118-0027 HIS TONES STRANGELY QUIET YES SENOR I HAVE THE PAPERS TO PROVE IT DO YOU ADMIT IT HE DEMANDED OF WALCOTT WITH A GLANCE WHICH MADE THE LATTER QUAIL WHILE HIS HAND SOUGHT ONE OF THE LOADED REVOLVERS LYING ON THE TABLE
4064-12118-0028 WE WERE MARRIED YEARS AGO BUT I DID NOT KNOW THE WOMAN WAS LIVING I SWEAR I DID NOT I SUPPOSED SHE WAS DEAD UNTIL THE DAY SHE CAME TO ME HOW ABOUT THE PAST YEAR YOU HAVE KNOWN ALL THIS TIME THAT SHE WAS LIVING
4064-12118-0029 DAVID OLD FRIEND CALM YOURSELF HE EXCLAIMED DON'T BE RASH OR FOOLISH LET THE LAW TAKE ITS COURSE THE LAW INTERPOSED MISTER UNDERWOOD FIERCELY
4064-12118-0030 AND THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AGAINST THAT MAN HIS OWN WIFE DO YOU SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT I'LL HAVE MY DAUGHTER'S NAME DRAGGED THROUGH SUCH MIRE NO BY GOD I'LL BLOW THE DOG'S BRAINS OUT WITH MY OWN HAND FIRST
4064-12118-0031 A FIERCE STRUGGLE ENSUED FOR A MOMENT BETWEEN THE TWO MEN WHICH ENDED IN JOHN BRITTON'S DISARMING HIS FRIEND KATE MEANWHILE KEEPING WALCOTT AT BAY AS HE SOUGHT IN THE MOMENTARY CONFUSION TO EFFECT AN ESCAPE
4064-12118-0032 ONCE CALMED MISTER UNDERWOOD NOTWITHSTANDING MISTER BRITTON'S PROTESTATIONS SULLENLY REFUSED TO PROSECUTE WALCOTT TELEPHONING FOR AN ATTORNEY WHO WAS AN OLD TIME AND TRUSTED FRIEND
4064-12118-0033 HE HAD AN AGREEMENT DRAWN AND SIGNED WHEREBY UPON THE REPAYMENT OF THE FUNDS BELONGING TO HIM AFTER DEDUCTING AN AMOUNT THEREFROM SUFFICIENT TO REPLACE WHAT HE HAD MISAPPROPRIATED HE WAS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY ALTOGETHER
4064-12118-0034 YOU HAVE ESCAPED THIS TIME WERE MISTER UNDERWOOD'S PARTING WORDS BUT REMEMBER IF YOU EVER AGAIN SEEK TO INJURE ME OR MINE NO POWER ON EARTH CAN SAVE YOU AND I'LL NOT GO INTO THE COURTS EITHER
4064-12118-0035 AS KATE AND HER STRANGE COMPANION PARTED THE FORMER INQUIRED WHY DID YOU ASK ME NOT TO SHOOT HIM YOU SURELY CANNOT LOVE HIM LOVE HIM SHE EXCLAIMED SOFTLY NO BUT I FEARED YOU WOULD KILL HIM
4064-12118-0036 HIS TIME HAS NOT COME YET SENORITA BUT WHEN IT DOES THIS MUST BE THE HAND SHE LIFTED HER OWN RIGHT HAND WITH A SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT AS SHE SAID THIS AND GLIDED OUT INTO THE DARKNESS AND WAS GONE ERE KATE COULD RECALL HER
