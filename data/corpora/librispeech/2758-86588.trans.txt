2758-86588-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE CONSTRUCTIVE FACULTIES HE WHO HATH LEARNED A SINGLE ART CAN THRIVE I WEEN IN ANY PART GERMAN PROVERB
2758-86588-0001 HE HAD INVENTIONS RARE WORDSWORTH WHEN I HAD AFTER MANY YEARS OF STUDY AND RESEARCH IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT DEVELOPED THE THEORY THAT ALL PRACTICAL TECHNICAL EDUCATION OF YOUTH
2758-86588-0002 SHOULD BE PRECEDED BY A LIGHT OR EASY TRAINING ON AN AESTHETIC BASIS OR THE MINOR ARTS I FOR FOUR YEARS TO TEST THE SCHEME WAS ENGAGED IN TEACHING IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA
2758-86588-0003 EVERY WEEK IN SEPARATE CLASSES TWO HUNDRED CHILDREN BESIDES A NUMBER OF LADIES THESE WERE FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THE CITY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THESE PUBLIC PUPILS WAS THEN
2758-86588-0004 MY PUPILS WERE TAUGHT FIRSTLY SIMPLE OUTLINE DECORATIVE DESIGN WITH DRAWING AT THE SAME TIME AFTER THIS ACCORDING TO SEX EASY EMBROIDERY WOOD CARVING
2758-86588-0005 MODELING IN CLAY LEATHER WORK CARPENTERING INLAYING
2758-86588-0006 PORCELAIN PAINTING AND OTHER SMALL ARTS NEARLY ALL OF THE PUPILS WHO WERE FROM TEN TO SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE ACQUIRED TWO OR THREE IF NOT ALL OF THESE ARTS
2758-86588-0007 AND THEN VERY EASILY FOUND EMPLOYMENT IN FACTORIES OR FABRICS ET CETERA MANY PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS ALL WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME AND QUITE UNKNOWN TO ME
2758-86588-0008 AT THEIR INSTIGATION AN INQUIRY WAS MADE OF ALL THE TEACHERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS TO THE STANDING OF MY ART PUPILS IN THEIR OTHER CLASSES IT BEING CONFIDENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT THEY WOULD BE FOUND TO HAVE FALLEN BEHIND
2758-86588-0009 AND THE RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS THAT THE TWO HUNDRED WERE IN ADVANCE OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND IN EVERY BRANCH GEOGRAPHY ARITHMETIC HISTORY AND SO ON IT WAS NOT REMARKABLE
2758-86588-0010 BECAUSE BOYS AND GIRLS WHO HAD AT AN AVERAGE AGE OF TWELVE OR THIRTEEN LEARNED THE PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN AND ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO SEVERAL KINDS OF HANDIWORK AND KNEW THE DIFFERENCES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF GOTHIC
2758-86588-0011 ESPECIALLY IF THIS BE DONE IN A PLEASING EASY MANNER WITH AGREEABLE WORK ALSO DEVELOP WITH IT THE INTELLECT AND THAT VERY RAPIDLY TO A VERY REMARKABLE DEGREE THERE ARE REASONS FOR THIS
2758-86588-0012 DRAWING WHEN PROPERLY TAUGHT STIMULATES VISUAL PERCEPTION OR EYE MEMORY THIS IS STRIKINGLY THE CASE WHEN THE PUPIL HAS A MODEL PLACED IN ONE ROOM AND AFTER STUDYING IT
2758-86588-0013 GOES INTO ANOTHER ROOM TO REPRODUCE IT FROM MEMORY ORIGINAL DESIGN WHICH WHEN PROPERLY TAUGHT IS LEARNED WITH INCREDIBLE EASE BY ALL CHILDREN STIMULATES OBSERVATION TO A REMARKABLE DEGREE
2758-86588-0014 THE RESULT OF SUCH EDUCATION IS TO DEVELOP A GREAT GENERAL QUICKNESS OF PERCEPTION AND THOUGHT NOW BE IT OBSERVED THAT IF ANYONE DESIRES TO LEARN DESIGN OR ANY ART
2758-86588-0015 IT MAY BE GREATLY FACILITATED BY THE APPLICATION TO IT OF WILL AND FORESIGHT AND IN THE BEGINNING SELF SUGGESTION HE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE THREE AS ONE
2758-86588-0016 SEES IN IT A HIGHER OR MORE ENERGETIC KIND OF SELF DISCIPLINE THAN MOST PEOPLE PRACTISE IN THE END THEY COME TO THE SAME AS A VIGOROUS EFFORT OF THE WILL
2758-86588-0017 THUS HAVING MASTERED THE VERY EASY PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN WHICH GOVERN ALL ORGANIC DEVELOPMENT OR VEGETABLE GROWTH AS SET FORTH IN A PLANT WITH ROOTS OFFSHOOTS OR CROCHETS
2758-86588-0018 AND END ORNAMENTS FLOWERS OR FINIALS WITH THE CIRCLE SPIRAL AND OFFSHOOTING ORNAMENTS RINGS MADE INTO VINES AND WAVE PATTERNS ALL OF WHICH CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN AN HOUR WITH DIAGRAMS
2758-86588-0019 OR THAT IT MUST BE DONE HE WILL PROBABLY FEEL THE IMPULSE AND SUCCEED THIS IS THE MORE LIKELY BECAUSE PATTERNS IMPRESS THEMSELVES VERY VIVIDLY ON THE MEMORY OR IMAGINATION
2758-86588-0020 AND WHEN STUDIED ARE EASILY RECALLED AFTER A LITTLE PRACTICE THE MANNER IN WHICH MOST ARTISTS FORM AN IDEA OR PROJECT THEIR MINDS TO A PLAN OR INVENTION
2758-86588-0021 BE IT A STATUE OR PICTURE AND THE WAY THEY THINK IT OVER AND ANTICIPATE IT VERY OFTEN ACTUALLY SEEING THE PICTURE IN A FINISHED STATE IN IMAGINATION
2758-86588-0022 ALL AMOUNTS TO FORESIGHT AND HYPNOTIC PREPARATION IN A CRUDE IMPERFECT FORM IF ANY ARTIST WHO IS GIFTED WITH RESOLUTION AND PERSEVERANCE WILL SIMPLY MAKE TRIAL OF THE METHOD HERE RECOMMENDED
2758-86588-0023 IN ANY CASE IF THEY HAD LEARNED TO USE THEIR HANDS AND THEIR INVENTIVENESS OR ADAPTABILITY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BETTER FOR IT THAT THE INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE WHO CAN DO NOTHING OF THE KIND
2758-86588-0024 AND WHO TAKE NO REAL INTEREST IN ANYTHING EXCEPT SPENDING MONEY AND GOSSIPING ARE TO BE REALLY PITIED IS TRUE SOME OF THEM ONCE HAD MINDS AND THESE ARE THE MOST PITIFUL OR PITIABLE OF ALL
2758-86588-0025 SO AS TO INTEREST ANYTHING WHICH WOULD MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING FOR EXCEPT LOVE WHICH IS GOOD TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY ALL IN ALL SAVE TO THE EROTO MANIAC
2758-86588-0026 BEYOND MERE STORY TELLING OR EVEN BEING INTERESTING WHICH MEANS THE LOVE OR DETECTIVE BUSINESS I WOULD SUGGEST TO SOME OF THESE WRITERS THAT THE MARVELOUS LATENT POWERS OF THE HUMAN MIND
2758-86588-0027 LYCURGUS ONCE TOOK TWO PUPPIES OF THE SAME LITTER AND HAD THE ONE BROUGHT UP TO HUNT WHILE THE OTHER WAS NURSED AT HOME IN ALL LUXURY AND WHEN GROWN AND LET LOOSE THE ONE CAUGHT A HARE WHILE THE OTHER YELPED AND RAN AWAY
2758-86588-0028 SO THE WORD HANDY IN OLD ENGLISH HEND MEANING QUICK ALERT OR GIFTED WITH PROMPT PERCEPTION IS DERIVED FROM KNOWING HOW TO USE THE HANDS BRUSONIUS
2758-86588-0029 FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO HAS COLLECTED A GREAT NUMBER OF CLASSIC ANECDOTES TO ILLUSTRATE THIS SAYING RECAPITULATION THOSE WHO DESIRE TO BECOME ARTISTS CAN GREATLY FACILITATE THEIR WORK
