4063-186231-0000 PATRICIA SPEAKS FRANKLY IT WAS LAWYER WATSON'S SUGGESTION THAT SHE WAS BEING UNJUST TO BETH AND LOUISE IN ENCOURAGING THEM TO HOPE THEY MIGHT INHERIT ELMHURST
4063-186231-0001 THAT FINALLY DECIDED AUNT JANE TO END ALL MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND INFORM HER NIECES OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAD MADE A FINAL DISPOSITION OF HER PROPERTY SO ONE MORNING SHE SENT WORD ASKING THEM ALL INTO HER ROOM
4063-186231-0002 AND WHEN THE NIECES APPEARED THEY FOUND UNCLE JOHN AND THE LAWYER ALREADY IN THEIR AUNT'S PRESENCE THERE WAS AN AIR OF IMPRESSIVE FORMALITY PERVADING THE ROOM ALTHOUGH MISS MERRICK'S BROTHER AT LEAST WAS AS IGNORANT AS HER NIECES
4063-186231-0003 OF THE REASON WHY THEY HAD BEEN SUMMONED PATSY CAME IN LAST HOBBLING ACTIVELY ON HER CRUTCHES ALTHOUGH THE LEG WAS NOW NEARLY RECOVERED AND SEATED HERSELF SOMEWHAT IN THE REAR OF THE APARTMENT
4063-186231-0004 AUNT JANE LOOKED INTO ONE EXPECTANT FACE AFTER ANOTHER WITH CURIOUS INTEREST AND THEN BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING GRAVELY BUT IN MORE GENTLE TONES THAN SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO USE
4063-186231-0005 I AM OLD AND MUST SOON PASS AWAY AND INSTEAD OF LEAVING YOU AND YOUR PARENTS WHO WOULD BE MY LEGITIMATE HEIRS TO SQUABBLE OVER MY PROPERTY WHEN I AM GONE I DECIDED TO EXCUTE A WILL
4063-186231-0006 BEQUEATHING MY ESTATE TO SOME ONE WHO WOULD TAKE PROPER CARE OF IT AND MAINTAIN IT IN A CREDITABLE MANNER I HAD NO PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH ANY OF YOU BUT JUDGED THAT ONE OUT OF THE THREE MIGHT SERVE MY PURPOSE AND THEREFORE INVITED YOU ALL HERE
4063-186231-0007 BY THIS TIME THE HEARTS OF LOUISE AND BETH WERE FLUTTERING WITH EXCITEMENT AND EVEN PATSY LOOKED INTERESTED UNCLE JOHN SAT A LITTLE APART WATCHING THEM WITH AN AMUSED SMILE UPON HIS FACE
4063-186231-0008 AND THE LAWYER SAT SILENT WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON A PATTERN IN THE RUG IN ARRIVING AT A DECISION WHICH I MAY SAY I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DOING CONTINUED AUNT JANE CALMLY
4063-186231-0009 AND SELECTED THE NIECE I PREFER TO BECOME MY HEIRESS YOU CANNOT ACCUSE OF INJUSTICE BECAUSE NONE OF YOU HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING OF ME BUT I WILL SAY THIS THAT I AM WELL PLEASED WITH ALL THREE OF YOU
4063-186231-0010 AND NOW WISH THAT I HAD TAKEN PAINS TO FORM YOUR ACQUAINTANCE EARLIER IN LIFE YOU MIGHT HAVE CHEERED MY OLD AGE AND RENDERED IT LESS LONELY AND DULL WELL SAID JANE REMARKED UNCLE JOHN NODDING HIS HEAD APPROVINGLY
4063-186231-0011 SHE DID NOT NOTICE THE INTERRUPTION BUT PRESENTLY CONTINUED SOME DAYS AGO I ASKED MY LAWYER MISTER WATSON TO DRAW UP MY WILL IT WAS AT ONCE PREPARED AND SIGNED AND NOW STANDS AS MY LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

4063-186231-0017 SHAKING HIS LITTLE ROUND BODY AS IF HE HAD MET WITH THE MOST AMUSING THING THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED IN HIS LIFE AUNT JANE STARED AT HIM WHILE LOUISE AND BETH LOOKED THEIR ASTONISHMENT BUT PATSY'S CLEAR LAUGHTER RANG ABOVE UNCLE JOHN'S GASPING CHUCKLES
4063-186231-0018 I HOPE DEAR UNCLE SAID SHE MISCHIEVOUSLY THAT WHEN POOR AUNT JANE IS GONE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BUY A NEW NECKTIE HE LOOKED AT HER WHIMSICALLY AND WIPED THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES THANK YOU JANE
