1252-134983-0000 THAT NIGHT WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN HIS ROOM A BEAUTIFUL LADY SUDDENLY APPEARED BEFORE HIM HER LONG DRESS WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW AND SHE HAD A CROWN OF WHITE ROSES UPON HER HEAD THE GOOD KING WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE HER
1252-134983-0001 FOR HE KNEW HIS DOOR HAD BEEN TIGHTLY SHUT AND HE COULD NOT THINK HOW SHE HAD GOT IN BUT SHE SAID TO HIM I AM THE FAIRY TRUTH I WAS PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD WHEN YOU WERE OUT HUNTING
1252-134983-0002 FOR I KNOW THAT THOSE WHO ARE MERCIFUL TO ANIMALS WILL BE STILL KINDER TO THEIR FELLOW MEN IF YOU HAD REFUSED TO HELP ME
1252-134983-0003 MADAM SAID THE GOOD KING SINCE YOU ARE A FAIRY YOU NO DOUBT KNOW ALL MY WISHES I HAVE BUT ONE SON WHOM I LOVE VERY DEARLY THAT IS WHY HE IS CALLED PRINCE DARLING IF YOU ARE REALLY GOOD ENOUGH TO WISH TO DO ME A FAVOR
1252-134983-0004 WITH ALL MY HEART ANSWERED THE FAIRY I CAN MAKE YOUR SON THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE IN THE WORLD OR THE RICHEST OR THE MOST POWERFUL CHOOSE WHICHEVER YOU LIKE FOR HIM I DO NOT ASK EITHER OF THESE THINGS FOR MY SON REPLIED THE GOOD KING BUT IF YOU WILL MAKE HIM THE BEST OF PRINCES
1252-134983-0005 I SHALL INDEED BE GRATEFUL TO YOU WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO HIM TO BE RICH OR HANDSOME OR TO POSSESS ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD IF HE WERE WICKED YOU KNOW WELL HE WOULD STILL BE UNHAPPY ONLY A GOOD MAN CAN BE REALLY CONTENTED YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT ANSWERED THE FAIRY
1252-134983-0006 UNLESS HE WILL HELP ME HE MUST HIMSELF TRY HARD TO BECOME GOOD I CAN ONLY PROMISE TO GIVE HIM GOOD ADVICE TO SCOLD HIM FOR HIS FAULTS
1252-134983-0007 THE GOOD KING WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THIS PROMISE AND VERY SOON AFTERWARD HE DIED PRINCE DARLING WAS VERY SORRY
1252-134983-0008 AND HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN ALL HIS KINGDOMS AND ALL HIS TREASURES OF GOLD AND SILVER IF THEY COULD HAVE KEPT THE GOOD KING WITH HIM TWO DAYS AFTERWARD WHEN THE PRINCE HAD GONE TO BED THE FAIRY SUDDENLY APPEARED TO HIM AND SAID
1252-134983-0009 I PROMISED YOUR FATHER THAT I WOULD BE YOUR FRIEND AND TO KEEP MY WORD I HAVE COME TO BRING YOU A PRESENT AT THE SAME TIME SHE PUT A LITTLE GOLD RING UPON HIS FINGER TAKE GREAT CARE OF THIS RING SHE SAID IT IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN DIAMONDS EVERY TIME YOU DO A BAD DEED IT WILL PRICK YOUR FINGER
1252-134983-0010 BUT IF IN SPITE OF ITS PRICKING YOU GO ON IN YOUR OWN EVIL WAY YOU WILL LOSE MY FRIENDSHIP AND I SHALL BECOME YOUR ENEMY SO SAYING THE FAIRY DISAPPEARED LEAVING PRINCE DARLING VERY MUCH ASTONISHED FOR SOME TIME HE BEHAVED SO WELL THAT THE RING NEVER PRICKED HIM
1252-134983-0011 ONE DAY HOWEVER HE WENT OUT HUNTING BUT COULD GET NO SPORT WHICH PUT HIM IN A VERY BAD TEMPER IT SEEMED TO HIM AS HE RODE ALONG THAT HIS RING WAS PRESSING INTO HIS FINGER BUT AS IT DID NOT PRICK HIM HE DID NOT HEED IT WHEN HE GOT HOME AND WENT TO HIS OWN ROOM
1252-134983-0012 HIS LITTLE DOG BIBI RAN TO MEET HIM JUMPING ROUND HIM WITH PLEASURE GET AWAY SAID THE PRINCE QUITE GRUFFLY I DON'T WANT YOU YOU ARE IN THE WAY THE POOR LITTLE DOG WHO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL PULLED AT HIS COAT TO MAKE HIM AT LEAST LOOK AT HER
1252-134983-0013 AND THIS MADE PRINCE DARLING SO CROSS THAT HE GAVE HER QUITE A HARD KICK INSTANTLY HIS RING PRICKED HIM SHARPLY
1252-134983-0014 HE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED AND SAT DOWN IN A CORNER OF HIS ROOM FEELING QUITE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
1252-134983-0015 WHAT IS THE GOOD OF MY BEING RULER OF A GREAT KINGDOM IF I AM NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO BEAT MY OWN DOG
1252-134983-0016 ANSWERING PRINCE DARLING'S THOUGHTS YOU HAVE COMMITTED THREE FAULTS
1252-134983-0017 YOU WERE OUT OF TEMPER BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT HAVE WHAT YOU WANTED AND YOU THOUGHT ALL MEN AND ANIMALS WERE ONLY MADE TO DO YOUR PLEASURE
1252-134983-0018 WHICH IS VERY NAUGHTY INDEED AND LASTLY YOU WERE CRUEL TO A POOR LITTLE ANIMAL WHO DID NOT IN THE LEAST DESERVE TO BE ILL TREATED I KNOW YOU ARE FAR ABOVE A LITTLE DOG
1252-134983-0019 I MIGHT AT THIS MOMENT BEAT YOU OR KILL YOU FOR A FAIRY IS GREATER THAN A MAN THE ADVANTAGE OF POSSESSING A GREAT EMPIRE IS NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE EVIL THAT ONE DESIRES BUT TO DO ALL THE GOOD THAT ONE POSSIBLY CAN
1252-134983-0020 THE PRINCE SAW HOW NAUGHTY HE HAD BEEN AND PROMISED TO TRY AND DO BETTER IN FUTURE BUT HE DID NOT KEEP HIS WORD THE FACT WAS HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP BY A FOOLISH NURSE WHO HAD SPOILED HIM WHEN HE WAS LITTLE
1252-134983-0021 IF HE WANTED ANYTHING HE ONLY HAD TO CRY AND FRET AND STAMP HIS FEET AND SHE WOULD GIVE HIM WHATEVER HE ASKED FOR WHICH HAD MADE HIM SELF WILLED ALSO SHE HAD TOLD HIM FROM MORNING TO NIGHT THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY BE A KING AND THAT KINGS WERE VERY HAPPY
1252-134983-0022 WHEN THE PRINCE GREW OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND HE SOON LEARNED THAT THERE COULD BE NOTHING WORSE THAN TO BE PROUD OBSTINATE AND CONCEITED AND HE HAD REALLY TRIED TO CURE HIMSELF OF THESE DEFECTS BUT BY THAT TIME ALL HIS FAULTS HAD BECOME HABITS
1252-134983-0023 AND A BAD HABIT IS VERY HARD TO GET RID OF NOT THAT HE WAS NATURALLY OF A BAD DISPOSITION HE WAS TRULY SORRY WHEN HE HAD BEEN NAUGHTY AND SAID I AM VERY UNHAPPY TO HAVE TO STRUGGLE AGAINST MY ANGER AND PRIDE EVERY DAY IF I HAD BEEN PUNISHED FOR THEM WHEN I WAS LITTLE
1252-134983-0024 THEY WOULD NOT BE SUCH A TROUBLE TO ME NOW HIS RING PRICKED HIM VERY OFTEN AND SOMETIMES HE LEFT OFF WHAT HE WAS DOING AT ONCE
1252-134983-0025 TRIFLING FAULT BUT WHEN HE WAS REALLY NAUGHTY IT MADE HIS FINGER ACTUALLY BLEED AT LAST HE GOT TIRED OF BEING CONSTANTLY REMINDED AND WANTED TO BE ABLE TO DO AS HE LIKED SO HE THREW HIS RING ASIDE
1252-134983-0026 HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO DOING EVERY FOOLISH THING THAT OCCURRED TO HIM
1252-134983-0027 AND NOBODY COULD LIKE HIM ANY LONGER ONE DAY WHEN THE PRINCE WAS WALKING ABOUT
1252-134983-0028 HER NAME WAS CELIA AND SHE WAS AS GOOD AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL PRINCE DARLING FANCIED THAT CELIA WOULD THINK HERSELF ONLY TOO HAPPY IF HE OFFERED TO MAKE HER A GREAT QUEEN BUT SHE SAID FEARLESSLY SIRE I AM ONLY A SHEPHERDESS
1252-134983-0029 AND A POOR GIRL BUT NEVERTHELESS I WILL NOT MARRY YOU DO YOU DISLIKE ME
1252-134983-0030 NO MY PRINCE REPLIED CELIA I CANNOT HELP THINKING YOU VERY HANDSOME BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD RICHES BE TO ME AND ALL THE GRAND DRESSES AND SPLENDID CARRIAGES THAT YOU WOULD GIVE ME
1252-134983-0031 THE PRINCE WAS VERY ANGRY AT THIS SPEECH AND COMMANDED HIS OFFICERS TO MAKE CELIA A PRISONER AND CARRY HER OFF TO HIS PALACE ALL DAY LONG THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID ANNOYED HIM BUT AS HE LOVED HER HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO HAVE HER PUNISHED
1252-134983-0032 ONE OF THE PRINCE'S FAVORITE COMPANIONS WAS HIS FOSTER BROTHER WHOM HE TRUSTED ENTIRELY
1252-134983-0033 AND ENCOURAGED HIM IN ALL HIS EVIL WAYS WHEN HE SAW THE PRINCE SO DOWNCAST HE ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
1252-134983-0034 AND WAS RESOLVED TO BE A BETTER MAN
1252-134983-0035 THIS EVIL ADVISER SAID TO HIM YOU ARE VERY KIND TO TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THIS LITTLE GIRL IF I WERE YOU I WOULD SOON MAKE HER OBEY ME REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE A KING AND THAT IT WOULD BE LAUGHABLE TO SEE YOU TRYING TO PLEASE A SHEPHERDESS WHO OUGHT TO BE ONLY TOO GLAD TO BE ONE OF YOUR SLAVES
1252-134983-0036 KEEP HER IN PRISON AND FEED HER ON BREAD AND WATER FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN IF SHE STILL SAYS SHE WILL NOT MARRY YOU HAVE HER HEAD CUT OFF
1252-134983-0037 WHY IF YOU CANNOT MAKE A GIRL LIKE THAT DO AS YOU WISH
1252-134983-0038 BUT SAID PRINCE DARLING WOULD IT NOT BE A SHAME IF I HAD AN INNOCENT GIRL PUT TO DEATH FOR CELIA HAS DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE PUNISHMENT IF PEOPLE WILL NOT DO AS YOU TELL THEM THEY OUGHT TO SUFFER FOR IT ANSWERED HIS FOSTER BROTHER BUT EVEN IF IT WERE UNJUST
1252-134983-0039 YOU HAD BETTER BE ACCUSED OF THAT BY YOUR SUBJECTS
1252-134983-0040 IN SAYING THIS HE WAS TOUCHING A WEAK POINT IN HIS BROTHER'S CHARACTER FOR THE PRINCE'S FEAR OF LOSING ANY OF HIS POWER MADE HIM AT ONCE ABANDON HIS FIRST IDEA OF TRYING TO BE GOOD AND RESOLVE TO TRY AND FRIGHTEN THE SHEPHERDESS INTO CONSENTING TO MARRY HIM
1252-134983-0041 HIS FOSTER BROTHER WHO WANTED HIM TO KEEP THIS RESOLUTION
1252-134983-0042 AND THEY PERSUADED HIM TO DRINK A GREAT DEAL OF WINE AND CONTINUED TO EXCITE HIS ANGER AGAINST CELIA BY TELLING HIM THAT SHE HAD LAUGHED AT HIS LOVE FOR HER UNTIL AT LAST IN QUITE A FURIOUS RAGE HE RUSHED OFF TO FIND HER DECLARING THAT IF SHE STILL REFUSED TO MARRY HIM
1252-134983-0043 SHE SHOULD BE SOLD AS A SLAVE THE VERY NEXT DAY BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE ROOM IN WHICH CELIA HAD BEEN LOCKED UP HE WAS GREATLY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT SHE WAS NOT IN IT THOUGH HE HAD THE KEY IN HIS OWN POCKET ALL THE TIME HIS ANGER WAS TERRIBLE
1252-134983-0044 HIS BAD FRIENDS WHEN THEY HEARD HIM RESOLVED TO TURN HIS WRATH UPON AN OLD NOBLEMAN WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN HIS TUTOR AND WHO STILL DARED SOMETIMES TO TELL THE PRINCE OF HIS FAULTS FOR HE LOVED HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIS OWN SON AT FIRST PRINCE DARLING HAD THANKED HIM
1252-134983-0045 BUT AFTER A TIME HE GREW IMPATIENT AND THOUGHT IT MUST BE JUST MERE LOVE OF FAULT FINDING THAT MADE HIS OLD TUTOR BLAME HIM WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WAS PRAISING AND FLATTERING HIM SO HE ORDERED HIM TO RETIRE FROM HIS COURT THOUGH HE STILL FROM TIME TO TIME SPOKE OF HIM AS A WORTHY MAN WHOM HE RESPECTED
1252-134983-0046 EVEN IF HE NO LONGER LOVED HIM HIS UNWORTHY FRIENDS FEARED THAT HE MIGHT SOME DAY TAKE IT INTO HIS HEAD TO RECALL HIS OLD TUTOR
1252-134983-0047 THEY REPORTED TO THE PRINCE THAT SULIMAN FOR THAT WAS THE TUTOR'S NAME HAD BOASTED OF HAVING HELPED CELIA TO ESCAPE AND THEY BRIBED THREE MEN TO SAY THAT SULIMAN HIMSELF HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT IT THE PRINCE IN GREAT ANGER SENT HIS FOSTER BROTHER WITH A NUMBER OF SOLDIERS TO BRING HIS TUTOR BEFORE HIM IN CHAINS
1252-134983-0048 LIKE A CRIMINAL AFTER GIVING THIS ORDER HE WENT TO HIS OWN ROOM BUT HE HAD SCARCELY GOT INTO IT WHEN THERE WAS A CLAP OF THUNDER WHICH MADE THE GROUND SHAKE AND THE FAIRY TRUTH APPEARED SUDDENLY BEFORE HIM I PROMISED YOUR FATHER SAID SHE STERNLY TO GIVE YOU GOOD ADVICE
1252-134983-0049 REALLY YOU ARE A MONSTER THE HORROR OF EVERYONE WHO KNOWS YOU IT IS TIME THAT I SHOULD FULFIL MY PROMISE AND BEGIN YOUR PUNISHMENT I CONDEMN YOU TO RESEMBLE THE ANIMALS WHOSE WAYS YOU HAVE IMITATED YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF LIKE THE LION BY YOUR ANGER AND LIKE THE WOLF BY YOUR GREEDINESS
1252-134983-0050 THEREFORE IN YOUR NEW FORM TAKE THE APPEARANCE OF ALL THESE ANIMALS
1252-134983-0051 AS THEY APPROACHED THE TOWN HE SAW THAT SOME GREAT REJOICING WAS BEING HELD AND WHEN THE HUNTERS ASKED WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY WERE TOLD THAT THE PRINCE WHOSE ONLY PLEASURE IT WAS TO TORMENT HIS PEOPLE HAD BEEN FOUND IN HIS ROOM KILLED BY A THUNDER BOLT
1252-134983-0052 FOUR OF HIS COURTIERS THOSE WHO HAD ENCOURAGED HIM IN HIS WICKED DOINGS HAD TRIED TO SEIZE THE KINGDOM AND DIVIDE IT BETWEEN THEM BUT THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW IT WAS THEIR BAD COUNSELS WHICH HAD SO CHANGED THE PRINCE HAD CUT OFF THEIR HEADS AND HAD OFFERED THE CROWN TO SULIMAN
1252-134983-0053 WHOM THE PRINCE HAD LEFT IN PRISON THIS NOBLE LORD HAD JUST BEEN CROWNED AND THE DELIVERANCE OF THE KINGDOM WAS THE CAUSE OF THE REJOICING FOR THEY SAID HE IS A GOOD AND JUST MAN AND WE SHALL ONCE MORE ENJOY PEACE AND PROSPERITY PRINCE DARLING ROARED WITH ANGER WHEN HE HEARD THIS
1252-134983-0054 HE WAS LED AWAY BY FLATTERERS I KNEW HIS HEART AND AM CERTAIN THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE BAD INFLUENCE OF THOSE WHO SURROUNDED HIM HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD KING AND A FATHER TO HIS PEOPLE WE MAY HATE HIS FAULTS
1252-134983-0055 AS FOR ME I WOULD DIE GLADLY IF THAT COULD BRING BACK OUR PRINCE TO REIGN JUSTLY AND WORTHILY ONCE MORE THESE WORDS WENT TO PRINCE DARLING'S HEART HE REALIZED THE TRUE AFFECTION AND FAITHFULNESS OF HIS OLD TUTOR
1252-134983-0056 AND TO ADMIT THAT HIS PUNISHMENT WAS NOT MORE THAN HE HAD DESERVED HE LEFT OFF TEARING AT THE IRON BARS OF THE CAGE IN WHICH HE WAS SHUT UP AND BECAME AS GENTLE AS A LAMB THE HUNTERS WHO HAD CAUGHT HIM TOOK HIM TO A GREAT MENAGERIE
1252-134983-0057 BY BEING GENTLE AND OBEDIENT TO THE MAN WHO HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HIM UNFORTUNATELY THIS MAN WAS VERY ROUGH AND UNKIND AND THOUGH THE POOR MONSTER WAS QUITE QUIET HE OFTEN BEAT HIM WITHOUT RHYME OR REASON WHEN HE HAPPENED TO BE IN A BAD TEMPER
1252-134983-0058 ONE DAY WHEN THIS KEEPER WAS ASLEEP A TIGER BROKE ITS CHAIN AND FLEW AT HIM TO EAT HIM UP
1252-134983-0059 BUT SOON THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND WISHED THAT HE WERE FREE I WOULD RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND SAVE THE UNHAPPY MAN'S LIFE HE HAD HARDLY WISHED THIS WHEN HIS IRON CAGE FLEW OPEN AND HE RUSHED TO THE SIDE OF THE KEEPER WHO WAS AWAKE AND WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST THE TIGER
1252-134983-0060 WHEN HE SAW THE MONSTER HAD GOT OUT HE GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR LOST
1252-134983-0061 AND VERY SOON KILLED IT AND THEN CAME AND CROUCHED AT THE FEET OF THE MAN IT HAD SAVED OVERCOME WITH GRATITUDE THE KEEPER STOOPED TO CARESS THE STRANGE CREATURE WHICH HAD DONE HIM SUCH A GREAT SERVICE BUT SUDDENLY A VOICE SAID IN HIS EAR A GOOD ACTION SHOULD NEVER GO UNREWARDED
1252-134983-0062 AND HE SAW AT HIS FEET ONLY A PRETTY LITTLE DOG PRINCE DARLING
1252-134983-0063 AND THE MAN TAKING HIM UP IN HIS ARMS CARRIED HIM TO THE KING
1252-134983-0064 THE QUEEN SAID SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS WONDERFUL LITTLE DOG
1252-134983-0065 THE QUEEN PETTED AND TOOK CARE OF HIM BUT SHE WAS SO AFRAID THAT HE WOULD GET TOO FAT THAT SHE CONSULTED THE COURT PHYSICIAN WHO SAID THAT HE WAS TO BE FED ONLY UPON BREAD AND WAS NOT TO HAVE MUCH EVEN OF THAT SO POOR PRINCE DARLING WAS TERRIBLY HUNGRY ALL DAY LONG
1252-134983-0066 BUT HE WAS VERY PATIENT ABOUT IT ONE DAY WHEN THEY GAVE HIM HIS LITTLE LOAF FOR BREAKFAST HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO EAT IT OUT IN THE GARDEN
1252-134983-0067 AND WHERE IT HAD BEEN STOOD A GREAT HOUSE THAT SEEMED TO BE BUILT OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WERE GOING INTO IT
1252-134983-0068 FROM THE WINDOWS BUT WHAT SEEMED VERY STRANGE WAS THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE WERE PALE AND THIN AND THEIR CLOTHES WERE TORN AND HANGING IN RAGS ABOUT THEM SOME FELL DOWN DEAD AS THEY CAME OUT BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO GET AWAY OTHERS CRAWLED FARTHER WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY
1252-134983-0069 FAINTING WITH HUNGER AND BEGGED A MORSEL OF BREAD FROM THOSE WHO WERE GOING INTO THE HOUSE
1252-134983-0070 PRINCE DARLING WENT UP TO A YOUNG GIRL
1252-134983-0071 TOUCHED WITH COMPASSION HE SAID TO HIMSELF I AM VERY HUNGRY BUT I SHALL NOT DIE OF STARVATION BEFORE I GET MY DINNER IF I GIVE MY BREAKFAST TO THIS POOR CREATURE PERHAPS I MAY SAVE HER LIFE SO HE LAID HIS PIECE OF BREAD IN THE GIRL'S HAND AND SAW HER EAT IT UP
1252-134983-0072 EAGERLY SHE SOON SEEMED TO BE QUITE WELL AGAIN AND THE PRINCE DELIGHTED TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP HER WAS THINKING OF GOING HOME TO THE PALACE WHEN HE HEARD A GREAT OUTCRY AND TURNING ROUND SAW CELIA WHO WAS BEING CARRIED AGAINST HER WILL INTO THE GREAT HOUSE
1252-134983-0073 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PRINCE REGRETTED THAT HE WAS NO LONGER THE MONSTER THEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESCUE CELIA
1252-134983-0074 WHO WERE CARRYING HER OFF AND TRY TO FOLLOW THEM BUT THEY CHASED AND KICKED HIM AWAY HE DETERMINED NOT TO QUIT THE PLACE TILL HE KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF CELIA AND BLAMED HIMSELF FOR WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HER ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
1252-134983-0075 BUT ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT I DID MYSELF AND IF I HAD NOT BEEN PREVENTED DID I NOT INTEND TO BE STILL MORE CRUEL TO HER
1252-134983-0076 WHO CAME FORWARD AND THREW OUT A PLATE OF MOST DELICIOUS LOOKING FOOD THEN THE WINDOW WAS SHUT AGAIN AND PRINCE DARLING WHO HAD NOT HAD ANYTHING TO EAT ALL DAY THOUGHT HE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING SOMETHING
1252-134983-0077 BUT THE YOUNG GIRL TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN HIS BREAD GAVE A CRY OF TERROR AND TOOK HIM UP IN HER ARMS SAYING DON'T TOUCH IT MY POOR LITTLE DOG THAT HOUSE IS THE PALACE OF PLEASURE AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF IT IS POISONED AT THE SAME MOMENT A VOICE SAID YOU SEE A GOOD ACTION ALWAYS BRINGS ITS REWARD
1252-134983-0078 AND THE PRINCE FOUND HIMSELF CHANGED INTO A BEAUTIFUL WHITE DOVE HE REMEMBERED THAT WHITE WAS THE FAVORITE COLOR OF THE FAIRY TRUTH AND BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HE MIGHT AT LAST WIN BACK HER FAVOR BUT JUST NOW HIS FIRST CARE WAS FOR CELIA
1252-134983-0079 AND RISING INTO THE AIR HE FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE HOUSE UNTIL HE SAW AN OPEN WINDOW BUT HE SEARCHED THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN VAIN
1252-134983-0080 AND THE PRINCE IN DESPAIR DETERMINED TO SEARCH THROUGH THE WORLD TILL HE FOUND HER HE FLEW ON AND ON FOR SEVERAL DAYS TILL HE CAME TO A GREAT DESERT WHERE HE SAW A CAVERN AND TO HIS DELIGHT THERE SAT CELIA SHARING THE SIMPLE BREAKFAST OF AN OLD HERMIT OVERJOYED TO HAVE FOUND HER
1252-134983-0081 PRINCE DARLING PERCHED UPON HER SHOULDER TRYING TO EXPRESS BY HIS CARESSES HOW GLAD HE WAS TO SEE HER AGAIN AND CELIA SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED BY THE TAMENESS OF THIS PRETTY WHITE DOVE STROKED IT SOFTLY AND SAID THOUGH SHE NEVER THOUGHT OF ITS UNDERSTANDING HER
1252-134983-0082 I ACCEPT THE GIFT THAT YOU MAKE ME OF YOURSELF AND I WILL LOVE YOU ALWAYS
1252-134983-0083 WHO WAS AT THAT MOMENT RESTORED TO HIS NATURAL SHAPE YOU PROMISED TO LOVE ME ALWAYS TELL ME THAT YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAID OR I SHALL HAVE TO ASK THE FAIRY TO GIVE ME BACK THE FORM OF THE DOVE WHICH PLEASED YOU SO MUCH YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THAT SHE WILL CHANGE HER MIND SAID THE FAIRY
1252-134983-0084 THROWING OFF THE HERMIT'S ROBE IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DISGUISED AND APPEARING BEFORE THEM CELIA HAS LOVED YOU EVER SINCE SHE FIRST SAW YOU ONLY SHE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHILE YOU WERE SO OBSTINATE AND NAUGHTY
1252-134983-0085 CELIA AND PRINCE DARLING THREW THEMSELVES AT THE FAIRY'S FEET
1252-134983-0086 CELIA WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR HOW SORRY HE WAS FOR ALL HIS PAST FOLLIES AND MISDEEDS AND PROMISED TO LOVE HIM AS LONG AS SHE LIVED RISE MY CHILDREN SAID THE FAIRY AND I WILL TRANSPORT YOU TO THE PALACE AND PRINCE DARLING
1252-134983-0087 SHALL HAVE BACK AGAIN THE CROWN HE FORFEITED BY HIS BAD BEHAVIOR WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN SULIMAN'S HALL AND HIS DELIGHT WAS GREAT AT SEEING HIS DEAR MASTER ONCE MORE HE GAVE UP THE THRONE JOYFULLY TO THE PRINCE AND REMAINED ALWAYS THE MOST FAITHFUL OF HIS SUBJECTS
