1757-128103-0000 WHICH FOLLOWED THE CORONATION OF CHARLES THE FIFTH AT BOLOGNA AN ERA TO WHICH MISTER SYMONDS GIVES THE NAME OF THE CATHOLIC REACTION AND THEY CONTAIN A MOST INTERESTING AND VALUABLE ACCOUNT OF THE POSITION OF SPAIN IN THE ITALIAN PENINSULA
1757-128103-0001 THE CONDUCT OF THE TRIDENTINE COUNCIL THE SPECIFIC ORGANISATION OF THE HOLY OFFICE AND THE COMPANY OF JESUS AND THE STATE OF SOCIETY UPON WHICH THOSE FORCES WERE BROUGHT TO BEAR IN HIS PREVIOUS VOLUMES MISTER SYMONDS HAD REGARDED THE PAST RATHER AS A PICTURE TO BE PAINTED
1757-128103-0002 THAN AS A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED IN THESE TWO LAST VOLUMES HOWEVER HE SHOWS A CLEARER APPRECIATION OF THE OFFICE OF HISTORY THE ART OF THE PICTURESQUE CHRONICLER IS COMPLETED BY SOMETHING LIKE THE SCIENCE OF THE TRUE HISTORIAN
1757-128103-0003 THE CRITICAL SPIRIT BEGINS TO MANIFEST ITSELF AND LIFE IS NOT TREATED AS A MERE SPECTACLE BUT THE LAWS OF ITS EVOLUTION AND PROGRESS ARE INVESTIGATED ALSO WE ADMIT THAT THE DESIRE TO REPRESENT LIFE AT ALL COSTS UNDER DRAMATIC CONDITIONS
1757-128103-0004 STILL ACCOMPANIES MISTER SYMONDS AND THAT HE HARDLY REALISES THAT WHAT SEEMS ROMANCE TO US WAS HARSH REALITY TO THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN IT LIKE MOST DRAMATISTS ALSO HE IS MORE INTERESTED IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXCEPTIONS THAN IN THE GENERAL RULE
1757-128103-0005 HE HAS SOMETHING OF SHAKESPEARE'S SOVEREIGN CONTEMPT OF THE MASSES THE PEOPLE STIR HIM VERY LITTLE BUT HE IS FASCINATED BY GREAT PERSONALITIES YET IT IS ONLY FAIR TO REMEMBER THAT THE AGE ITSELF WAS ONE OF EXAGGERATED INDIVIDUALISM
1757-128103-0006 AND THAT LITERATURE HAD NOT YET BECOME A MOUTHPIECE FOR THE UTTERANCES OF HUMANITY MEN APPRECIATED THE ARISTOCRACY OF INTELLECT BUT WITH THE DEMOCRACY OF SUFFERING THEY HAD NO SYMPATHY THE CRY FROM THE BRICKFIELDS HAD STILL TO BE HEARD
1757-128103-0007 MISTER SYMONDS STYLE TOO HAS MUCH IMPROVED HERE AND THERE IT IS TRUE WE COME ACROSS TRACES OF THE OLD MANNER AS IN THE APOCALYPTIC VISION OF THE SEVEN DEVILS THAT ENTERED ITALY WITH THE SPANIARD
1757-128103-0008 A HIDEOUS IDOL WHOSE FACE WAS BLACKENED WITH SOOT FROM BURNING HUMAN FLESH SUCH A SENTENCE ALSO AS
1757-128103-0009 REMINDS US THAT RHETORIC HAS NOT YET LOST ITS CHARMS FOR MISTER SYMONDS STILL ON THE WHOLE THE STYLE SHOWS FAR MORE RESERVE BALANCE AND SOBRIETY THAN CAN BE FOUND IN THE EARLIER VOLUMES WHERE VIOLENT ANTITHESIS FORMS THE PREDOMINANT CHARACTERISTIC
1757-128103-0010 AND ACCURACY IS OFTEN SACRIFICED TO AN ADJECTIVE AMONGST THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK ARE THOSE ON THE INQUISITION ON SARPI THE GREAT CHAMPION OF THE SEVERANCE OF CHURCH FROM STATE AND ON GIORDANO BRUNO
1757-128103-0011 HIS SOJOURN IN PARIS AND WANDERINGS THROUGH GERMANY DOWN TO HIS BETRAYAL AT VENICE AND MARTYRDOM AT ROME IS MOST POWERFULLY TOLD AND THE ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF HIS PHILOSOPHY AND THE RELATION HE HOLDS TO MODERN SCIENCE IS AT ONCE JUST AND APPRECIATIVE
1757-128103-0012 THE ACCOUNT ALSO OF IGNATIUS LOYOLA AND THE RISE OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING THOUGH WE CANNOT THINK THAT MISTER SYMONDS IS VERY HAPPY IN HIS COMPARISON OF THE JESUITS TO FANATICS LAYING STONES UPON A RAILWAY OR
1757-128103-0013 DYNAMITERS BLOWING UP AN EMPEROR OR A CORNER OF WESTMINSTER HALL SUCH A JUDGMENT IS HARSH AND CRUDE IN EXPRESSION AND MORE SUITABLE TO THE CLAMOUR OF THE PROTESTANT UNION THAN TO THE DIGNITY OF THE TRUE HISTORIAN MISTER SYMONDS HOWEVER IS RARELY DELIBERATELY UNFAIR
1757-128103-0014 ON THE POETRY OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY MISTER SYMONDS HAS OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY AND ON SUCH SUBJECTS HE ALWAYS WRITES WITH EASE GRACE AND DELICACY OF PERCEPTION
1757-128103-0015 IT SEEMS TO US THAT IT WOULD BE MORE USEFUL TO EMPHASISE THE FACT THAT EACH ART HAS ITS SEPARATE METHOD OF EXPRESSION THE ESSAY ON TASSO HOWEVER IS DELIGHTFUL READING AND THE POSITION THE POET HOLDS TOWARDS MODERN MUSIC AND MODERN SENTIMENT
1757-128103-0016 IS ANALYSED WITH MUCH SUBTLETY THE ESSAY ON MARINO ALSO IS FULL OF INTEREST WE HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WHETHER THOSE WHO TALK SO GLIBLY OF EUPHUISM AND MARINISM IN LITERATURE HAVE EVER READ EITHER EUPHUES OR THE ADONE
1757-128103-0017 TO THE LATTER THEY CAN HAVE NO BETTER GUIDE THAN MISTER SYMONDS WHOSE DESCRIPTION OF THE POEM IS MOST FASCINATING MARINO LIKE MANY GREATER MEN HAS SUFFERED MUCH FROM HIS DISCIPLES BUT HE HIMSELF WAS A MASTER OF GRACEFUL FANCY
1757-128103-0018 NOT OF COURSE A GREAT POET BUT CERTAINLY AN ARTIST IN POETRY AND ONE TO WHOM LANGUAGE IS INDEBTED EVEN THOSE CONCEITS THAT MISTER SYMONDS FEELS BOUND TO CENSURE HAVE SOMETHING CHARMING ABOUT THEM
1757-128103-0019 THE CONTINUAL USE OF PERIPHRASES IS UNDOUBTEDLY A GRAVE FAULT IN STYLE YET WHO BUT A PEDANT WOULD REALLY QUARREL WITH SUCH PERIPHRASES AS
1757-128103-0020 FROM THE POETS MISTER SYMONDS PASSES TO THE PAINTERS NOT THOSE GREAT ARTISTS OF FLORENCE AND VENICE OF WHOM HE HAS ALREADY WRITTEN
1757-128103-0021 THIS CHAPTER IS TOO POLEMICAL TO BE PLEASANT THE ONE ON MUSIC IS MUCH BETTER AND MISTER SYMONDS GIVES US A MOST INTERESTING DESCRIPTION OF THE GRADUAL STEPS BY WHICH THE ITALIAN GENIUS PASSED FROM POETRY AND PAINTING TO MELODY AND SONG
1757-128103-0022 TILL THE WHOLE OF EUROPE THRILLED WITH THE MARVEL AND MYSTERY OF THIS NEW LANGUAGE OF THE SOUL SOME SMALL DETAILS SHOULD PERHAPS BE NOTICED IT IS HARDLY ACCURATE FOR INSTANCE
1757-128103-0023 WAS THE FIRST FORM OF THE RECITATIVE OPERA
1757-128103-0024 AND CAVALIERE'S RAPPRESENTAZIONE PRECEDED IT BY SOME YEARS AND IT IS SOMEWHAT EXAGGERATED TO SAY THAT UNDER THE REGIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH THE NATIONAL GROWTH OF ENGLISH MUSIC RECEIVED A CHECK FROM WHICH IT NEVER AFTERWARDS RECOVERED AS IT WAS WITH CROMWELL'S AUSPICES
1757-128103-0025 THAT THE FIRST ENGLISH OPERA WAS PRODUCED THIRTEEN YEARS BEFORE ANY OPERA WAS REGULARLY ESTABLISHED IN PARIS THE FACT THAT ENGLAND DID NOT MAKE SUCH DEVELOPMENT IN MUSIC AS ITALY AND GERMANY DID MUST BE ASCRIBED TO OTHER CAUSES THAN THE PREVALENCE OF PURITAN OPINION
1757-128103-0026 THESE HOWEVER ARE MINOR POINTS MISTER SYMONDS IS TO BE WARMLY CONGRATULATED ON THE COMPLETION OF HIS HISTORY OF THE RENAISSANCE IN ITALY IT IS A MOST WONDERFUL MONUMENT OF LITERARY LABOUR AND ITS VALUE TO THE STUDENT OF HUMANISM CANNOT BE DOUBTED
1757-128103-0027 WE HAVE OFTEN HAD OCCASION TO DIFFER FROM MISTER SYMONDS ON QUESTIONS OF DETAIL AND WE HAVE MORE THAN ONCE FELT IT OUR DUTY TO PROTEST AGAINST THE RHETORIC AND OVER EMPHASIS OF HIS STYLE BUT WE FULLY RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS WORK
1757-128103-0028 AND THE IMPETUS HE HAS GIVEN TO THE STUDY OF ONE OF THE VITAL PERIODS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY MISTER SYMONDS LEARNING HAS NOT MADE HIM A PEDANT HIS CULTURE HAS WIDENED NOT NARROWED HIS SYMPATHIES AND THOUGH HE CAN HARDLY BE CALLED A GREAT HISTORIAN
1757-128103-0029 YET HE WILL ALWAYS OCCUPY A PLACE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
1757-128103-0030 RENAISSANCE IN ITALY THE CATHOLIC REACTION IN TWO PARTS BY JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS
