6497-234100-0000 MISTER HARE STOOD LOOKING AT HIS DEAD DAUGHTER JOHN NORTON SAT BY THE WINDOW HIS BRAIN WAS EMPTY EVERYTHING WAS FAR AWAY HE SAW THINGS MOVING MOVING BUT THEY WERE ALL FAR AWAY
6497-234100-0001 SHE HAD WALKED WITH HIM ON THE HILLS SHE HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM AS FAR AS THE BURGH SHE HAD WAVED HER HAND TO HIM BEFORE THEY WALKED QUITE OUT OF EACH OTHER'S SIGHT NOW SHE WAS DEAD HAD HE LOVED HER
6497-234100-0002 WHY WAS THERE NEITHER BURNING GRIEF NOR TEARS HE ENVIED THE HARD SOBBING FATHER'S GRIEF THE FATHER WHO HELD HIS DEAD DAUGHTER'S HAND AND SHOWED A FACE ON WHICH WAS PRINTED SO DEEPLY THE TERROR OF THE SOUL'S EMOTION
6497-234100-0003 THAT JOHN FELT A SUPERNATURAL AWE CREEP UPON HIM FELT THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS A SORT OF SACRILEGE HE CREPT DOWNSTAIRS
6497-234100-0004 HE WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE PLACE HE HAD LAST SEEN HER IN SHE USUALLY SAT ON THAT SOFA
6497-234100-0005 AND NOW HE SHOULD NOT SEE HER ANY MORE ONLY THREE DAYS AGO SHE HAD BEEN SITTING IN THAT BASKET CHAIR HOW WELL HE REMEMBERED HER WORDS HER LAUGHTER
6497-234100-0006 SHADOW LIKE IS HUMAN LIFE ONE MOMENT IT IS HERE THE NEXT IT IS GONE HER WORK BASKET THE VERY BALL OF WOOL WHICH HE HAD HELD FOR HER TO WIND THE NOVEL WHICH SHE HAD LENT TO HIM
6497-234100-0007 TO WALK HOME ACROSS THE DOWNS ALL THE WHILE THINKING THINKING OVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE SHE HAD CONSENTED AND ALARMED AT THE PROSPECT OF THE NEW DUTIES HE HAD CONTRACTED
6497-234100-0008 HE HAD RETURNED HOME THESE NEWLY CONTRACTED DUTIES HAD STIRRED HIS BEING TO ITS VERY DEPTH THE CHANCE APPEARANCE OF A GIPSY GIRL WITHOUT THE AID OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HE FELT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN
6497-234100-0009 HAD SET HIS LIFE ABOUT WITH ENDLESS EVENTUALITY HE COULD NOT SEE TO THE END THE FUTURE HE HAD INDEFINITELY PLIGHTED AND HIS OWN INTIMATE AND PERSONAL LIFE HAD BEEN ABANDONED FOR EVER
6497-234100-0010 HE HAD WALKED UP AND DOWN HIS STUDY HIS MIND AFLAME HE HAD SAT IN HIS ARM CHAIR FACING THE MOONLIGHT CONSIDERING A QUESTION TO HIM SO IMPORTANT SO FAR REACHING THAT HIS MIND AT MOMENTS SEEMED AS IF LIKE TO SNAP
6497-234100-0011 TO BREAK BUT WHICH WAS ACCEPTED BY NINE TENTHS OF HUMANITY WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT AS LIGHTLY AS THE MOST SUPERFICIAL DETAIL OF DAILY LIFE BUT HOW OTHERS ACTED WAS NOT HIS CONCERN HE MUST CONSIDER HIS OWN COMPETENCE
6497-234100-0012 TO BEAR THE BURDEN THE PERILOUS BURDEN HE HAD ASKED AND WHICH HAD BEEN PROMISED TO HIM HE MUST NOT ADVENTURE INTO A LIFE HE WAS NOT FITTED FOR HE MUST NOT WRECK ANOTHER'S LIFE
6497-234100-0013 THEIR INTERESTS WERE MUTUAL THEY WERE IDENTICAL THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF EGOTISM
6497-234100-0014 IT HAD HAUNTED HIS THOUGHT IT HAD BECOME HIS DAILY COMPANION HIS FAMILIAR SPIRIT
6497-234100-0015 IT FACED HIM ALWAYS WITH THE SAME UNMOVABLE MYSTERIOUS EYES IN WHICH HE READ NOTHING WHICH TOLD HIM NOTHING OF WHAT HE LONGED TO KNOW HE ONLY KNEW THAT HE HAD DESIRED THIS GIRL AS A WIFE
6497-234100-0016 ON THIS POINT HE WAS UNCERTAIN THIS WAS NATURE'S SECRET IN THE MIDST OF HIS STRESS OF MIND HIS EYES HAD WANDERED OVER HIS BOOKS THEY HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY THE COLOUR OF A SMALL THIN VOLUME
6497-234100-0017 AND OBEYING AN INSTINCT HE HAD TAKEN THE VOLUME DOWN HE KNEW IT WELL
6497-234100-0018 IS HIS MASTER FACULTY AS THE BODY IS FOR THE PHYSICIAN AND THE TRAINER AND THE SOIL IS THE SUBJECT FOR THE HUSBANDMAN AND THE WORK OF THE GOOD AND WISE MAN IS TO USE APPEARANCES ACCORDING TO NATURE
6497-234100-0019 AND NEITHER WAY FOR WHAT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL IN THE LIGHT OF THESE WORDS JOHN'S MIND GREW SERENE AS A LANDSCAPE ON WHICH THE MOON IS SHINING AND HE ASKED HIMSELF WHY HE HAD HESITATED IF MARRIAGE WERE THE STATE
6497-234100-0020 WHICH HE WAS DESTINED TO FULFIL IF A HABIT AFFECTS US
6497-234100-0021 AGAINST THAT MUST WE ENDEAVOUR TO FIND SOME REMEDY AND WHAT REMEDY IS TO BE FOUND AGAINST A HABIT THE CONTRARY HABIT A TEMPTATION OF THE FLESH HAD COME UPON HIM HE HAD YIELDED TO IT INSTEAD OF OPPOSING IT WITH THE CONTRARY HABIT
6497-234100-0022 OF CHASTITY FOR CHASTITY HAD NEVER AFFLICTED HIM IT HAD EVER BEEN TO HIM A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND COURAGE CHASTITY HAD BROUGHT HIM PEACE OF MIND BUT THE PASSION TO WHICH HE HAD IN A MEASURE YIELDED
6497-234100-0023 AND LOVE ROBS US OF THAT THEREFORE IT MUST BE MALEFICENT AND THIS PASSION WHICH HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH TROUBLE WHAT IS IT A PASSING EMOTION OF WHICH I AM ASHAMED OF WHICH I WOULD SPEAK TO NO ONE
6497-234100-0024 AN EMOTION WHICH MAN SHARES WITH THE LOWEST ANIMALS BUT WHICH HIS HIGHER NATURE TEACHES HIM TO CHECK AND SUBJECT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THIS EMOTION MIGHT COME UPON HIM AGAIN BUT EACH TIME HE THOUGHT
6497-234100-0025 I SHALL BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT BETTER THAN THE LAST AND IT WILL GROW WEAKER AND WEAKER UNTIL AT LAST IT WILL PASS AND TO RETURN NO MORE BUT HE HAD PROPOSED TO KITTY AND HAD BEEN ACCEPTED
6497-234100-0026 AND FOR SOME SOLUTION OF THIS MATERIAL DIFFICULTY HE HAD TO FALL BACK UPON THE ARGUMENT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO WRECK ANOTHER'S LIFE THAT IN CONSIDERING HIS INTERESTS HE WAS CONSIDERING HERS
6497-234100-0027 AND HE HAD STOOD IN THE DAWN LIGHT PONDERING A MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM A POSITION INTO WHICH A CHANCE CIRCUMSTANCE HAD LED HIM HE HAD GONE TO BED HOPING TO FIND COUNSEL IN THE NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING HE HAD WAKED FIRM IN HIS RESOLVE
6497-234100-0028 AND HAD GONE TO SHOREHAM IN THE INTENTION OF BREAKING HIS ENGAGEMENT BUT INSTEAD HE HAD WITNESSED A CRUEL AND TERRIBLE SUICIDE THE REASON OF WHICH WAS HIDDEN FROM HIM POSSIBLY NONE WOULD EVER KNOW THE REASON
6497-234100-0029 PERHAPS IT WERE BETTER SO THE REASONS THAT PROMPTED SUICIDE WERE BETTER UNREVEALED AND NOW AS HE RETURNED HOME AFTER THE TRAGEDY ABOUT MIDWAY IN HIS WALK ACROSS THE DOWNS
6497-234100-0030 MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT REASON IN AN AFFECTED MIND FOR SUICIDE BUT THIS WAS NOT SO HE KNEW IT WAS NOT SO HE HAD BEEN SPARED THAT SHE WAS HERE WITH ME YESTERDAY HE SAID
6497-234100-0031 AND HE LOOKED DOWN THE LANDSCAPE NOW WRAPPED IN A WHITE MIST THE HILLS WERE LIKE GIANTS SLEEPING THE LONG DISTANCE VANISHED IN MYSTERIOUS MOONLIGHT HE COULD SEE BRIGHTON NEARER WAS SOUTHWICK
6497-234100-0032 AND FURTHER AWAY PAST THE SHADOWY SHORE WAS WORTHING
6497-234100-0033 AH LIFE LIFE WHAT HAST THOU FOR GIVING SAVE DECEPTIONS WHY DID I LEAVE MY LIFE OF CONTEMPLATION AND PRAYER TO ENTER INTO THAT OF DESIRE DID I NOT KNOW THAT THERE WAS NO HAPPINESS SAVE IN CALM AND CONTEMPLATION
6497-234100-0034 AND FOOLISH IS HE WHO PLACES HIS HAPPINESS IN THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD BUT WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HER SHE WAS MAD WHEN SHE THREW HERSELF OUT OF THE WINDOW TO ESCAPE FROM HIM BUT HOW HAD SHE BECOME MAD
6497-234100-0035 BY WHAT SUDDEN SNAPPING OF THE SENSE HAD MADNESS COME SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED DID MADNESS FALL LIKE THAT LIKE A BOLT FROM THE BLUE IF SO SHE MUST HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MAD
6497-234100-0036 AND WALKING HOME THE SLIGHT THREAD OF SENSE HALF WORN THROUGH HAD SUDDENLY SNAPPED HE KNEW THAT SHE LIKED HIM HAD SHE GUESSED THAT WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT THAT HE WOULD NOT
