1825-135580-0007 BY THIS CONVERSATION IT WILL APPEAR TO THE READER THAT THEY HAD BEEN TRYING TO IMPRESS PABLO WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND SUCH WAS THE CASE EDITH HAVING BEEN ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE IN THE ENDEAVOR
1825-135580-0008 ALTHOUGH VERY YOUNG FOR A MISSIONARY HOWEVER ALICE AND HUMPHREY HAD BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL AND PABLO WAS NOW BEGINNING TO COMPREHEND WHAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO INSTILL AND WAS REALLY PROGRESSING DAYLY
1825-135580-0009 EDWARD REMAINED AT THE COTTAGE EXPECTING TO BEAR SOME MESSAGE FROM THE INTENDANT HE WAS RIGHT IN HIS CONJECTURE FOR ON THE THIRD DAY OSWALD PARTRIDGE CAME OVER TO SAY THAT THE INTENDANT WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM IF HE COULD MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO GO OVER
1825-135580-0010 OSWALD HAD RIDDEN OVER ON A PONY EDWARD ARRANGED TO TAKE BILLY AND RETURN WITH HIM THEY STARTED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING AND EDWARD ASKED OSWALD
1825-135580-0011 NOT EXACTLY REPLIED OSWALD BUT I THINK
1825-135580-0012 IT IS TO OFFER YOU SOME SITUATION IF YOU COULD BE PREVAILED UPON TO ACCEPT IT VERY TRUE REPLIED EDWARD HE OFFERS ME THE POST OF SECRETARY WHAT DO YOU THINK WHY SIR I THINK I WOULD ACCEPT IT
1825-135580-0013 AT ALL EVENTS I WOULD TAKE IT ON TRIAL THERE CAN BE NO HARM DONE IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT YOU CAN ONLY GO BACK TO THE COTTAGE AGAIN ONE THING I AM SURE OF WHICH IS THAT MASTER HEATHERSTONE WILL MAKE IT AS PLEASANT TO YOU AS HE CAN

1825-135580-0016 AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY I WANT TO BE WHERE I CAN KNOW ALL THAT IS GOING ON WELL SIR IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE KING WILL COME OVER AS WELL AS YOURS YET I THINK AT PRESENT HE STANDS BUT A POOR CHANCE BUT MASTER HEATHERSTONE
1825-135580-0017 I SHOULD THINK BUT HE IS VERY CLOSE THE CONVERSATION THEN CHANGED AND AFTER A RIDE OF EIGHT HOURS THEY ARRIVED AT THE INTENDANT'S HOUSE EDWARD GAVE BILLY INTO OSWALD'S CHARGE AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
1825-135580-0018 PHOEBE LET HIM IN AND ASKED HIM INTO THE SITTING ROOM WHERE HE FOUND THE INTENDANT ALONE EDWARD ARMITAGE I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AND SHALL BE STILL MORE SO IF I FIND THAT YOU HAVE MADE UP YOUR MIND TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSITION

1825-135580-0051 YOU MUST FORGIVE HER AS SHE WAS THE MEANS OF YOUR PERFORMING A NOBLE ACTION AND I MUST FORGIVE HER AS SHE WAS THE MEANS OF MY LIFE BEING SAVED
1825-135580-0052 INDEED I OUGHT TO FEEL GRATEFUL TO HER FOR IF SHE HAD NOT GIVEN ME SO BAD A BED THAT NIGHT I NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO COMFORTABLY LODGED AS IT IS PROPOSED THAT I SHALL BE NOW I HOPE YOU ARE HUNGRY EDWARD SAID CLARA DINNER IS ALMOST READY

1825-135580-0059 MOST OF THEM ARE MEN WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE ARMY AND I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO THESE SITUATIONS TO GET RID OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE TROUBLESOME AND THEY ARE ANY THING BUT GOOD CHARACTERS THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WE KILL BUT FEW DEER

1825-135580-0067 TO TAKE UP HIS ABODE WITH THEM BILLY WAS FRESH AND CANTERED GAYLY ALONG SO THAT EDWARD WAS BACK EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND ONCE MORE WELCOMED BY HIS HOUSEHOLD HE STATED TO HUMPHREY ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED
1825-135580-0068 ALICE AND EDITH DID NOT QUITE SO MUCH APPROVE OF IT AND A FEW TEARS WERE SHED AT THE IDEA OF EDWARD LEAVING THE COTTAGE THE NEXT DAY EDWARD AND HUMPHREY SET OFF FOR LYMINGTON WITH BILLY IN THE CART DO YOU KNOW EDWARD SAID HUMPHREY

1825-135580-0070 AND YOU HAVE TWO COW CALVES BRINGING UP THAT IS VERY TRUE BUT I DO NOT INTEND TO HAVE GOATS FOR THEIR MILK BUT SIMPLY FOR EATING IN LIEU OF MUTTON SHEEP I CAN NOT MANAGE BUT GOATS WITH A LITTLE HAY IN WINTER WILL DO WELL
1825-135580-0071 AND WILL FIND THEMSELVES IN THE FOREST ALL THE YEAR ROUND I WON'T KILL ANY OF THE FEMALES FOR THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO AND AFTER THAT I EXPECT WE SHALL HAVE A FLOCK SUFFICIENT TO MEET ANY DEMAND UPON IT IT IS NOT A BAD IDEA HUMPHREY THEY WILL ALWAYS COME HOME

1825-135580-0073 REPLIED EDWARD WE WILL DRIVE THERE FIRST AS I MUST ASK HIM TO RECOMMEND ME TO A TAILOR ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT LYMINGTON THEY WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HOSTELRY AND FOUND THE LANDLORD AT HOME HE RECOMMENDED A TAILOR TO EDWARD
1825-135580-0074 WHO SENT FOR HIM TO THE INN AND WAS MEASURED BY HIM FOR A PLAIN SUIT OF DARK CLOTH EDWARD AND HUMPHREY THEN WENT OUT AS EDWARD HAD TO PROCURE BOOTS AND MANY OTHER ARTICLES OF DRESS TO CORRESPOND WITH THE ONE WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO ASSUME
1825-135580-0075 I AM MOST PUZZLED ABOUT A HAT HUMPHREY SAID EDWARD I HATE THOSE STEEPLE CROWNED HATS WORN BY THE ROUNDHEADS YET THE HAT AND FEATHER IS NOT PROPER FOR A SECRETARY I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO SUBMIT TO WEAR THE STEEPLE CROWNED HATS NEVERTHELESS
1825-135580-0076 SAID HUMPHREY YOUR DRESS AS I CONSIDER IS A SORT OF DISGRACE TO A CAVALIER BORN AND THE HEIR OF ARNWOOD WHY NOT THEREFORE TAKE ITS HAT AS WELL AS SECRETARY TO THE INTENDANT YOU SHOULD DRESS LIKE HIM IF NOT
1825-135580-0077 YOU MAY OCCASION REMARKS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TRAVEL ON HIS CONCERNS YOU ARE RIGHT HUMPHREY I MUST NOT DO THINGS BY HALVES AND UNLESS I WEAR THE HAT I MIGHT BE SUSPECTED I DOUBT IF THE INTENDANT WEARS IT FOR ANY OTHER REASON SAID HUMPHREY
1825-135580-0078 AT ALL EVENTS I WILL NOT GO TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FASHION REPLIED EDWARD LAUGHING SOME OF THE HATS ARE NOT QUITE SO TALL AS THE OTHERS HERE IS THE SHOP FOR THE HAT AND FOR THE SWORD BELT EDWARD CHOSE A HAT AND A PLAIN SWORD BELT
1825-135580-0079 WHILE ALL THESE PURCHASES ON THE PART OF EDWARD AND MANY OTHERS BY HUMPHREY SUCH AS NAILS SAWS TOOLS AND VARIOUS ARTICLES WHICH ALICE REQUIRED FOR THE HOUSEHOLD WERE GATHERED TOGETHER THE LANDLORD HAD SENT OUT TO INQUIRE FOR THE GOATS
1825-135580-0080 HUMPHREY LEFT EDWARD TO PUT AWAY THESE IN THE CART WHILE HE WENT OUT A SECOND TIME TO SEE THE GOATS HE MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE MAN WHO HAD THEM FOR SALE FOR A MALE AND THREE FEMALES WITH TWO KIDS EACH AT THEIR SIDES
1825-135580-0081 AND TEN MORE FEMALE KIDS WHICH HAD JUST BEEN WEANED THE MAN ENGAGED TO DRIVE THEM FROM LYMINGTON AS FAR AS THE ROAD WENT INTO THE FOREST ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN HUMPHREY WOULD MEET THEM PAY HIM HIS MONEY AND DRIVE THEM TO THE COTTAGE
1825-135580-0082 WHICH WOULD BE ONLY THREE MILES FROM THE PLACE AGREED UPON HAVING SETTLED THAT SATISFACTORILY HE RETURNED TO EDWARD WHO WAS ALL READY AND THEY WENT BACK HOME WE HAVE DIPPED SOMEWHAT INTO THE BAG TO DAY EDWARD SAID HUMPHREY BUT THE MONEY IS WELL SPENT
1825-135580-0083 I THINK SO HUMPHREY BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I SHALL BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE MONEY VERY SOON AS THE INTENDANT WILL PAY ME FOR MY SERVICES THE TAILOR HAS PROMISED THE CLOTHES ON SATURDAY WITHOUT FAIL SO THAT YOU OR I MUST GO FOR THEM I WILL GO EDWARD
1825-135580-0084 MY SISTERS WILL WISH YOU TO STAY WITH THEM NOW AS YOU ARE SO SOON TO LEAVE THEM AND I WILL TAKE PABLO WITH ME THAT HE MAY KNOW HIS WAY TO THE TOWN AND I WILL SHOW HIM WHERE TO BUY THINGS IN CASE HE GOES THERE BY HIMSELF IT APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE BEEN A MOST FORTUNATE THING

1825-135580-0086 THAT I COULD GET ON BY MYSELF BUT STILL EDWARD YOU KNOW WE CAN NOT TELL WHAT A DAY MAY BRING FORTH AND I MIGHT FALL SICK OR SOMETHING HAPPEN WHICH MIGHT PREVENT MY ATTENDING TO ANY THING AND THEN WITHOUT YOU OR PABLO EVERY THING MIGHT HAVE GONE TO RACK AND RUIN
1825-135580-0087 CERTAINLY WHEN WE THINK HOW WE WERE LEFT BY THE DEATH OF OLD JACOB TO OUR OWN RESOURCES WE HAVE MUCH TO THANK GOD FOR IN HAVING GOT ON SO WELL I AGREE WITH YOU AND ALSO THAT IT HAS PLEASED HEAVEN TO GRANT US ALL SUCH GOOD HEALTH

1825-135580-0090 AND SO YOU MAY TELL THE INTENDANT I WILL AND THAT WILL BE AN EXCUSE FOR HIM TO SEND SOME OVER IF HE PLEASES INDEED AS I KNOW I SHALL BE PERMITTED TO GO OUT WITH OSWALD IT WILL BE HARD IF A STRAY BUCK DOES NOT FIND ITS WAY TO THE COTTAGE
1825-135580-0091 THUS DID THEY CONTINUE TALKING OVER MATTERS TILL THEY ARRIVED AT THE COTTAGE ALICE CAME OUT TO THEM SAYING TO HUMPHREY
