3114-170977-0000 LET ME THEN OFFER YOU AN ILLUSTRATION WHICH MAY I THINK THROW A LIGHT UPON THIS SUBJECT WHAT IS YOUR ILLUSTRATION THE CASE OF RICH INDIVIDUALS IN CITIES WHO POSSESS MANY SLAVES
3114-170977-0001 WHAT SHOULD THEY FEAR NOTHING BUT DO YOU OBSERVE THE REASON OF THIS YES THE REASON IS THAT THE WHOLE CITY IS LEAGUED TOGETHER FOR THE PROTECTION OF EACH INDIVIDUAL
3114-170977-0002 VERY TRUE I SAID BUT IMAGINE ONE OF THESE OWNERS THE MASTER SAY OF SOME FIFTY SLAVES TOGETHER WITH HIS FAMILY AND PROPERTY AND SLAVES CARRIED OFF BY A GOD INTO THE WILDERNESS
3114-170977-0003 HE IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO ON A JOURNEY OR TO SEE THE THINGS WHICH OTHER FREEMEN DESIRE TO SEE BUT HE LIVES IN HIS HOLE LIKE A WOMAN HIDDEN IN THE HOUSE
3114-170977-0004 AND SEES ANYTHING OF INTEREST VERY TRUE HE SAID AND AMID EVILS SUCH AS THESE WILL NOT HE WHO IS ILL GOVERNED IN HIS OWN PERSON THE TYRANNICAL MAN I MEAN WHOM YOU JUST NOW DECIDED TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE OF ALL
3114-170977-0005 HE HAS TO BE MASTER OF OTHERS WHEN HE IS NOT MASTER OF HIMSELF
3114-170977-0006 BUT FIGHTING AND COMBATING WITH OTHER MEN YES HE SAID THE SIMILITUDE IS MOST EXACT IS NOT HIS CASE UTTERLY MISERABLE AND DOES NOT THE ACTUAL TYRANT LEAD A WORSE LIFE THAN HE WHOSE LIFE YOU DETERMINED TO BE THE WORST
3114-170977-0007 AND IS TRULY POOR IF YOU KNOW HOW TO INSPECT THE WHOLE SOUL OF HIM
3114-170977-0008 HE BECOMES AND IS OF NECESSITY MORE JEALOUS MORE FAITHLESS MORE UNJUST MORE FRIENDLESS MORE IMPIOUS THAN HE WAS AT FIRST HE IS THE PURVEYOR AND CHERISHER OF EVERY SORT OF VICE
3114-170977-0009 AND THAT HE MAKES EVERYBODY ELSE AS MISERABLE AS HIMSELF NO MAN OF ANY SENSE WILL DISPUTE YOUR WORDS COME THEN I SAID AND AS THE GENERAL UMPIRE IN THEATRICAL CONTESTS PROCLAIMS THE RESULT DO YOU ALSO DECIDE
3114-170977-0010 THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM IN ALL THEY ARE THE ROYAL TIMOCRATICAL OLIGARCHICAL DEMOCRATICAL TYRANNICAL THE DECISION WILL BE EASILY GIVEN HE REPLIED THEY SHALL BE CHORUSES COMING ON THE STAGE
3114-170977-0011 AND I MUST JUDGE THEM IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ENTER BY THE CRITERION OF VIRTUE AND VICE HAPPINESS AND MISERY NEED WE HIRE A HERALD OR SHALL I ANNOUNCE THAT THE SON OF ARISTON
3114-170977-0012 THE BEST HAS DECIDED THAT THE BEST AND JUSTEST IS ALSO THE HAPPIEST AND THAT THIS IS HE WHO IS THE MOST ROYAL MAN AND KING OVER HIMSELF AND THAT THE WORST AND MOST UNJUST MAN
3114-170977-0013 THEN THIS I SAID WILL BE OUR FIRST PROOF AND THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH MAY ALSO HAVE SOME WEIGHT WHAT IS THAT THE SECOND PROOF IS DERIVED FROM THE NATURE OF THE SOUL SEEING THAT THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL
3114-170977-0014 LIKE THE STATE HAS BEEN DIVIDED BY US INTO THREE PRINCIPLES THE DIVISION MAY I THINK FURNISH A NEW DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT NATURE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO THESE THREE PRINCIPLES THREE PLEASURES CORRESPOND
3114-170977-0015 ALSO THREE DESIRES AND GOVERNING POWERS HOW DO YOU MEAN HE SAID THERE IS ONE PRINCIPLE WITH WHICH AS WE WERE SAYING A MAN LEARNS ANOTHER WITH WHICH HE IS ANGRY THE THIRD
3114-170977-0016 HAVING MANY FORMS HAS NO SPECIAL NAME BUT IS DENOTED BY THE GENERAL TERM APPETITIVE FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH AND VEHEMENCE OF THE DESIRES OF EATING AND DRINKING AND THE OTHER SENSUAL APPETITES WHICH ARE THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF IT ALSO MONEY LOVING
3114-170977-0017 BECAUSE SUCH DESIRES ARE GENERALLY SATISFIED BY THE HELP OF MONEY THAT IS TRUE HE SAID IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT THE LOVES AND PLEASURES OF THIS THIRD PART WERE CONCERNED WITH GAIN WE SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO FALL BACK ON A SINGLE NOTION AND MIGHT TRULY
3114-170977-0018 AND INTELLIGIBLY DESCRIBE THIS PART OF THE SOUL AS LOVING GAIN OR MONEY I AGREE WITH YOU AGAIN IS NOT THE PASSIONATE ELEMENT WHOLLY SET ON RULING AND CONQUERING AND GETTING FAME TRUE
3114-170977-0019 SUPPOSE WE CALL IT THE CONTENTIOUS OR AMBITIOUS WOULD THE TERM BE SUITABLE EXTREMELY SUITABLE ON THE OTHER HAND EVERY ONE SEES THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF KNOWLEDGE IS WHOLLY DIRECTED TO THE TRUTH
3114-170977-0020 AND CARES LESS THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS FOR GAIN OR FAME FAR LESS LOVER OF WISDOM LOVER OF KNOWLEDGE ARE TITLES WHICH WE MAY FITLY APPLY TO THAT PART OF THE SOUL CERTAINLY
3114-170977-0021 LOVERS OF HONOUR LOVERS OF GAIN EXACTLY AND THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF PLEASURE WHICH ARE THEIR SEVERAL OBJECTS VERY TRUE NOW
3114-170977-0022 WITH THE SOLID ADVANTAGES OF GOLD AND SILVER TRUE HE SAID AND THE LOVER OF HONOUR WHAT WILL BE HIS OPINION WILL HE NOT THINK THAT THE PLEASURE OF RICHES IS VULGAR WHILE THE PLEASURE OF LEARNING IF IT BRINGS NO DISTINCTION
3114-170977-0023 NOT SO FAR INDEED FROM THE HEAVEN OF PLEASURE DOES HE NOT CALL THE OTHER PLEASURES NECESSARY UNDER THE IDEA THAT IF THERE WERE NO NECESSITY FOR THEM HE WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE THEM THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THAT HE REPLIED SINCE THEN
3114-170977-0024 OF THE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHICH HAS THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THE PLEASURES WHICH WE ENUMERATED HAS THE LOVER OF GAIN IN LEARNING THE NATURE OF ESSENTIAL TRUTH GREATER EXPERIENCE OF THE PLEASURE OF KNOWLEDGE THAN THE PHILOSOPHER HAS OF THE PLEASURE OF GAIN
3114-170977-0025 I SHOULD RATHER SAY EVEN HAD HE DESIRED COULD HARDLY HAVE TASTED THE SWEETNESS OF LEARNING AND KNOWING TRUTH
3114-170977-0026 FOR HE HAS A DOUBLE EXPERIENCE YES VERY GREAT AGAIN HAS HE GREATER EXPERIENCE OF THE PLEASURES OF HONOUR OR THE LOVER OF HONOUR OF THE PLEASURES OF WISDOM NAY HE SAID
3114-170977-0027 ALL THREE ARE HONOURED IN PROPORTION AS THEY ATTAIN THEIR OBJECT FOR THE RICH MAN AND THE BRAVE MAN AND THE WISE MAN ALIKE HAVE THEIR CROWD OF ADMIRERS AND AS THEY ALL RECEIVE HONOUR THEY ALL HAVE EXPERIENCE OF THE PLEASURES OF HONOUR
3114-170977-0028 BUT THE DELIGHT WHICH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE BEING IS KNOWN TO THE PHILOSOPHER ONLY HIS EXPERIENCE THEN WILL ENABLE HIM TO JUDGE BETTER THAN ANY ONE FAR BETTER AND HE IS THE ONLY ONE
3114-170977-0029 WHO HAS WISDOM AS WELL AS EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY FURTHER THE VERY FACULTY WHICH IS THE INSTRUMENT OF JUDGMENT IS NOT POSSESSED BY THE COVETOUS OR AMBITIOUS MAN BUT ONLY BY THE PHILOSOPHER WHAT FACULTY
3114-170977-0030 REASON WITH WHOM AS WE WERE SAYING
3114-170977-0031 YES AND REASONING IS PECULIARLY HIS INSTRUMENT CERTAINLY IF WEALTH AND GAIN WERE THE CRITERION
3114-170977-0032 THEN THE PRAISE OR BLAME OF THE LOVER OF GAIN WOULD SURELY BE THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ASSUREDLY OR IF HONOUR OR VICTORY OR COURAGE IN THAT CASE THE JUDGMENT OF THE AMBITIOUS OR PUGNACIOUS WOULD BE THE TRUEST
3114-170977-0033 CLEARLY BUT SINCE EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM AND REASON ARE THE JUDGES THE ONLY INFERENCE POSSIBLE HE REPLIED IS THAT PLEASURES WHICH ARE APPROVED BY THE LOVER OF WISDOM AND REASON ARE THE TRUEST
3114-170977-0034 AND SO WE ARRIVE AT THE RESULT THAT THE PLEASURE OF THE INTELLIGENT PART OF THE SOUL IS THE PLEASANTEST OF THE THREE AND THAT HE OF US IN WHOM THIS IS THE RULING PRINCIPLE HAS THE PLEASANTEST LIFE
3114-170977-0035 UNQUESTIONABLY HE SAID THE WISE MAN SPEAKS WITH AUTHORITY WHEN HE APPROVES OF HIS OWN LIFE AND WHAT DOES THE JUDGE AFFIRM TO BE THE LIFE WHICH IS NEXT AND THE PLEASURE WHICH IS NEXT
3114-170977-0036 WHO IS NEARER TO HIMSELF THAN THE MONEY MAKER LAST COMES THE LOVER OF GAIN VERY TRUE HE SAID TWICE IN SUCCESSION THEN HAS THE JUST MAN OVERTHROWN THE UNJUST IN THIS CONFLICT
3114-170977-0037 AND NOW COMES THE THIRD TRIAL WHICH IS DEDICATED TO OLYMPIAN ZEUS THE SAVIOUR A SAGE WHISPERS IN MY EAR THAT NO PLEASURE EXCEPT THAT OF THE WISE IS QUITE TRUE AND PURE ALL OTHERS ARE A SHADOW ONLY AND SURELY THIS WILL PROVE THE GREATEST AND MOST DECISIVE OF FALLS
3114-170977-0038 YES THE GREATEST BUT WILL YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF I WILL WORK OUT THE SUBJECT AND YOU SHALL ANSWER MY QUESTIONS PROCEED SAY THEN
3114-170977-0039 TRUE AND THERE IS A NEUTRAL STATE WHICH IS NEITHER PLEASURE NOR PAIN THERE IS A STATE WHICH IS INTERMEDIATE AND A SORT OF REPOSE OF THE SOUL ABOUT EITHER THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN
3114-170977-0040 YES I KNOW HE SAID AND WHEN PERSONS ARE SUFFERING FROM ACUTE PAIN YOU MUST HAVE HEARD THEM SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING PLEASANTER THAN TO GET RID OF THEIR PAIN I HAVE AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER CASES OF SUFFERING
3114-170977-0041 IN WHICH THE MERE REST AND CESSATION OF PAIN AND NOT ANY POSITIVE ENJOYMENT IS EXTOLLED BY THEM AS THE GREATEST PLEASURE YES HE SAID AT THE TIME THEY ARE PLEASED AND WELL CONTENT TO BE AT REST AGAIN
3114-170977-0042 WHEN PLEASURE CEASES THAT SORT OF REST OR CESSATION WILL BE PAINFUL DOUBTLESS HE SAID THEN THE INTERMEDIATE STATE OF REST WILL BE PLEASURE AND WILL ALSO BE PAIN SO IT WOULD SEEM
3114-170977-0043 BUT CAN THAT WHICH IS NEITHER BECOME BOTH I SHOULD SAY NOT AND BOTH PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE MOTIONS OF THE SOUL ARE THEY NOT YES BUT THAT WHICH IS NEITHER
3114-170977-0044 WAS JUST NOW SHOWN TO BE REST AND NOT MOTION AND IN A MEAN BETWEEN THEM YES HOW THEN CAN WE BE RIGHT IN SUPPOSING THAT THE ABSENCE OF PAIN IS PLEASURE OR THAT THE ABSENCE OF PLEASURE IS PAIN
3114-170977-0045 BUT ALL THESE REPRESENTATIONS WHEN TRIED BY THE TEST OF TRUE PLEASURE ARE NOT REAL BUT A SORT OF IMPOSITION THAT IS THE INFERENCE LOOK AT THE OTHER CLASS OF PLEASURES WHICH HAVE NO ANTECEDENT PAINS
3114-170977-0046 AND YOU WILL NO LONGER SUPPOSE AS YOU PERHAPS MAY AT PRESENT THAT PLEASURE IS ONLY THE CESSATION OF PAIN OR PAIN OF PLEASURE WHAT ARE THEY HE SAID AND WHERE SHALL I FIND THEM THERE ARE MANY OF THEM
3114-170977-0047 TAKE AS AN EXAMPLE THE PLEASURES OF SMELL WHICH ARE VERY GREAT AND HAVE NO ANTECEDENT PAINS THEY COME IN A MOMENT AND WHEN THEY DEPART LEAVE NO PAIN BEHIND THEM MOST TRUE HE SAID LET US NOT THEN
3114-170977-0048 BE INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT PURE PLEASURE IS THE CESSATION OF PAIN OR PAIN OF PLEASURE NO STILL THE MORE NUMEROUS AND VIOLENT PLEASURES WHICH REACH THE SOUL THROUGH THE BODY ARE GENERALLY OF THIS SORT THEY ARE RELIEFS OF PAIN
3114-170977-0049 THAT IS TRUE AND THE ANTICIPATIONS OF FUTURE PLEASURES AND PAINS ARE OF A LIKE NATURE YES SHALL I GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION OF THEM LET ME HEAR
3114-170977-0050 YOU WOULD ALLOW I SAID THAT THERE IS IN NATURE AN UPPER AND LOWER AND MIDDLE REGION I SHOULD AND IF A PERSON WERE TO GO FROM THE LOWER TO THE MIDDLE REGION WOULD HE NOT IMAGINE THAT HE IS GOING UP
3114-170977-0051 AND HE WHO IS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE AND SEES WHENCE HE HAS COME WOULD IMAGINE THAT HE IS ALREADY IN THE UPPER REGION IF HE HAS NEVER SEEN THE TRUE UPPER WORLD TO BE SURE HE SAID HOW CAN HE THINK OTHERWISE
3114-170977-0052 AND TRULY IMAGINE THAT HE WAS DESCENDING NO DOUBT ALL THAT WOULD ARISE OUT OF HIS IGNORANCE OF THE TRUE UPPER AND MIDDLE AND LOWER REGIONS
