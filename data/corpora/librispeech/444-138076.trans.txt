444-138076-0000 CHAPTER NINE MISSUS WILCOX CANNOT BE ACCUSED OF GIVING MARGARET MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT LIFE AND MARGARET ON THE OTHER HAND HAS MADE A FAIR SHOW OF MODESTY AND HAS PRETENDED TO AN INEXPERIENCE
444-138076-0001 THAT SHE CERTAINLY DID NOT FEEL SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE FOR OVER TEN YEARS SHE HAD ENTERTAINED ALMOST WITH DISTINCTION SHE HAD BROUGHT UP A CHARMING SISTER AND WAS BRINGING UP A BROTHER SURELY IF EXPERIENCE IS ATTAINABLE SHE HAD ATTAINED IT
444-138076-0002 AND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS ONE OF POLITE BEWILDERMENT HER TASTES WERE SIMPLE HER KNOWLEDGE OF CULTURE SLIGHT AND SHE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE NEW ENGLISH ART CLUB
444-138076-0003 NOR IN THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN JOURNALISM AND LITERATURE WHICH WAS STARTED AS A CONVERSATIONAL HARE THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE DARTED AFTER IT WITH CRIES OF JOY MARGARET LEADING THEM
444-138076-0004 AND NOT TILL THE MEAL WAS HALF OVER DID THEY REALIZE THAT THE PRINCIPAL GUEST HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE CHASE THERE WAS NO COMMON TOPIC MISSUS WILCOX WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN SPENT IN THE SERVICE OF HUSBAND AND SONS
444-138076-0005 HAD LITTLE TO SAY TO STRANGERS WHO HAD NEVER SHARED IT AND WHOSE AGE WAS HALF HER OWN CLEVER TALK ALARMED HER AND WITHERED HER DELICATE IMAGININGS IT WAS THE SOCIAL COUNTERPART OF A MOTORCAR ALL JERKS
444-138076-0006 AND SHE WAS A WISP OF HAY A FLOWER
444-138076-0007 HER HOSTESS WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN PLACING ROTHENSTEIN TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WAS REPEATED I HOPE THAT YOUR SISTER IS SAFE IN GERMANY BY NOW MARGARET CHECKED HERSELF AND SAID YES THANK YOU I HEARD ON TUESDAY
444-138076-0008 BUT THE DEMON OF VOCIFERATION WAS IN HER AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS OFF AGAIN ONLY ON TUESDAY FOR THEY LIVE RIGHT AWAY AT STETTIN
444-138076-0009 NEVER SAID MISSUS WILCOX GRAVELY
444-138076-0010 WAS THERE SUCH A THING AS STETTININITY MARGARET SWEPT ON PEOPLE AT STETTIN DROP THINGS INTO BOATS OUT OF OVERHANGING WAREHOUSES
444-138076-0011 OH MISSUS WILCOX YOU WOULD LOVE THE ODER THE RIVER OR RATHER RIVERS THERE SEEM TO BE DOZENS OF THEM ARE INTENSE BLUE AND THE PLAIN THEY RUN THROUGH AN INTENSEST GREEN
444-138076-0012 INDEED THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MOST BEAUTIFUL VIEW MISS SCHLEGEL SO I SAY BUT HELEN WHO WILL MUDDLE THINGS SAYS NO IT'S LIKE MUSIC
444-138076-0013 TO BE LIKE MUSIC IT'S OBLIGED TO REMIND HER OF A SYMPHONIC POEM
444-138076-0014 THE PART BY THE LANDING STAGE IS IN B MINOR IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY BUT LOWER DOWN THINGS GET EXTREMELY MIXED THERE IS A SLODGY THEME IN SEVERAL KEYS AT ONCE MEANING MUD BANKS AND ANOTHER FOR THE NAVIGABLE CANAL AND THE EXIT INTO THE BALTIC IS IN C
444-138076-0015 I AM NOT SURE THAT I AGREE DO YOU SAID HE TURNING TO MISSUS WILCOX SHE REPLIED I THINK MISS SCHLEGEL PUTS EVERYTHING SPLENDIDLY
444-138076-0016 AND A CHILL FELL ON THE CONVERSATION OH MISSUS WILCOX SAY SOMETHING NICER THAN THAT IT'S SUCH A SNUB TO BE TOLD YOU PUT THINGS SPLENDIDLY I DO NOT MEAN IT AS A SNUB
444-138076-0017 YOUR LAST SPEECH INTERESTED ME SO MUCH GENERALLY PEOPLE DO NOT
444-138076-0018 I HAVE LONG WANTED TO HEAR WHAT IS SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE THE OTHER SIDE THEN YOU DO DISAGREE OH GOOD GIVE US YOUR SIDE I HAVE NO SIDE BUT MY HUSBAND HER VOICE SOFTENED THE CHILL INCREASED
444-138076-0019 HAS VERY LITTLE FAITH IN THE CONTINENT AND OUR CHILDREN HAVE ALL TAKEN AFTER HIM ON WHAT GROUNDS DO THEY FEEL THAT THE CONTINENT IS IN BAD FORM MISSUS WILCOX HAD NO IDEA SHE PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO GROUNDS
444-138076-0020 SHE WAS NOT INTELLECTUAL NOR EVEN ALERT AND IT WAS ODD THAT ALL THE SAME SHE SHOULD GIVE THE IDEA OF GREATNESS MARGARET ZIGZAGGING WITH HER FRIENDS OVER THOUGHT AND ART WAS CONSCIOUS OF A PERSONALITY THAT TRANSCENDED THEIR OWN
444-138076-0021 AND DWARFED THEIR ACTIVITIES THERE WAS NO BITTERNESS IN MISSUS WILCOX THERE WAS NOT EVEN CRITICISM SHE WAS LOVABLE AND NO UNGRACIOUS OR UNCHARITABLE WORD HAD PASSED HER LIPS
444-138076-0022 YET SHE AND DAILY LIFE WERE OUT OF FOCUS ONE OR THE OTHER MUST SHOW BLURRED AND AT LUNCH SHE SEEMED MORE OUT OF FOCUS THAN USUAL AND NEARER THE LINE THAT DIVIDES LIFE FROM A LIFE THAT MAY BE OF GREATER IMPORTANCE
444-138076-0023 ITS LITERATURE AND ART HAVE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL THE KINK OF THE UNSEEN ABOUT THEM AND THIS PERSISTS EVEN THROUGH DECADENCE AND AFFECTATION
444-138076-0024 PEOPLE WILL THERE DISCUSS WITH HUMILITY VITAL QUESTIONS THAT WE HERE THINK OURSELVES TOO GOOD TO TOUCH WITH TONGS I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO PRUSSIAN SAID MISSUS WILCOX NOT EVEN TO SEE THAT INTERESTING VIEW THAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING
444-138076-0025 AND FOR DISCUSSING WITH HUMILITY I AM TOO OLD WE NEVER DISCUSS ANYTHING
444-138076-0026 IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM SAID MISSUS WILCOX UNEXPECTEDLY CATCHING ON TO THE THOUGHT AND ROUSING FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME A FAINT HOPE IN THE BREASTS OF THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM AND I SOMETIMES THINK BUT
444-138076-0027 THERE WAS A LITTLE SILENCE ONE ADMITS THAT THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SUFFRAGE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG SAID A GIRL OPPOSITE LEANING FORWARD AND CRUMBLING HER BREAD ARE THEY
444-138076-0028 I NEVER FOLLOW ANY ARGUMENTS I AM ONLY TOO THANKFUL NOT TO HAVE A VOTE MYSELF
444-138076-0029 I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I MUST BE GETTING BACK TO MY OVERHANGING WAREHOUSE SAID THE MAN THEY'VE TURNED DISGRACEFULLY STRICT
444-138076-0030 WON'T YOU EVEN HAVE COFFEE THEY LEFT THE DINING ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND AS MISSUS WILCOX BUTTONED UP HER JACKET SHE SAID WHAT AN INTERESTING LIFE YOU ALL LEAD IN LONDON NO
444-138076-0031 AND AM NOT PRETENDING
444-138076-0032 FOR ANOTHER YOU YOUNGER PEOPLE MOVE SO QUICKLY THAT IT DAZES ME CHARLES IS THE SAME DOLLY THE SAME BUT WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT OLD AND YOUNG I NEVER FORGET THAT THEY WERE SILENT FOR A MOMENT
444-138076-0033 THEN WITH A NEWBORN EMOTION THEY SHOOK HANDS THE CONVERSATION CEASED SUDDENLY WHEN MARGARET RE ENTERED THE DINING ROOM HER FRIENDS HAD BEEN TALKING OVER HER NEW FRIEND AND HAD DISMISSED HER AS
