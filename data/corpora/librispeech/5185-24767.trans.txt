5185-24767-0000 DESIRE ARISING FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL IN SO FAR AS SUCH KNOWLEDGE REGARDS WHAT IS FUTURE MAY BE MORE EASILY CONTROLLED OR QUENCHED THAN THE DESIRE FOR WHAT IS AGREEABLE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT PROOF
5185-24767-0001 EMOTION TOWARDS A THING WHICH WE CONCEIVE AS FUTURE IS FAINTER THAN EMOTION TOWARDS A THING THAT IS PRESENT
5185-24767-0002 BUT DESIRE WHICH ARISES FROM THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL THOUGH IT BE CONCERNED WITH THINGS WHICH ARE GOOD AT THE MOMENT CAN BE QUENCHED OR CONTROLLED BY ANY HEADSTRONG DESIRE
5185-24767-0003 IS OF UNIVERSAL APPLICATION WHEREFORE DESIRE ARISING FROM SUCH KNOWLEDGE WHEN CONCERNED WITH THE FUTURE CAN BE MORE EASILY CONTROLLED OR QUENCHED
5185-24767-0004 WHY IT IS THAT THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL STIRS UP CONFLICTS IN THE SOUL AND OFTEN YIELDS TO EVERY KIND OF PASSION
5185-24767-0005 I HAVE NOT WRITTEN THE ABOVE WITH THE OBJECT OF DRAWING THE CONCLUSION THAT IGNORANCE IS MORE EXCELLENT THAN KNOWLEDGE OR THAT A WISE MAN IS ON A PAR WITH A FOOL IN CONTROLLING HIS EMOTIONS BUT BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW THE POWER AND THE INFIRMITY OF OUR NATURE
5185-24767-0006 BEFORE WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT REASON CAN DO IN RESTRAINING THE EMOTIONS AND WHAT IS BEYOND HER POWER I HAVE SAID THAT IN THE PRESENT PART I SHALL MERELY TREAT OF HUMAN INFIRMITY
5185-24767-0007 IS OTHER CONDITIONS BEING EQUAL STRONGER THAN DESIRE ARISING FROM PAIN PROOF DESIRE IS THE ESSENCE OF A MAN
5185-24767-0008 THAT IS THE ENDEAVOUR WHEREBY A MAN ENDEAVOURS TO PERSIST IN HIS OWN BEING WHEREFORE DESIRE ARISING FROM PLEASURE IS BY THE FACT OF PLEASURE BEING FELT INCREASED OR HELPED ON THE CONTRARY DESIRE ARISING FROM PAIN
5185-24767-0009 IS BY THE FACT OF PAIN BEING FELT DIMINISHED OR HINDERED HENCE THE FORCE OF DESIRE ARISING FROM PLEASURE MUST BE DEFINED
5185-24767-0010 TOGETHER WITH THE POWER OF AN EXTERNAL CAUSE WHEREAS DESIRE ARISING FROM PAIN
5185-24767-0011 NOTE IN THESE FEW REMARKS I HAVE EXPLAINED THE CAUSES OF HUMAN INFIRMITY AND INCONSTANCY AND SHOWN WHY MEN DO NOT ABIDE BY THE PRECEPTS OF REASON IT NOW REMAINS FOR ME TO SHOW WHAT COURSE IS MARKED OUT FOR US BY REASON
5185-24767-0012 WHICH OF THE EMOTIONS ARE IN HARMONY WITH THE RULES OF HUMAN REASON
5185-24767-0013 BUT BEFORE I BEGIN TO PROVE MY PROPOSITIONS IN DETAILED GEOMETRICAL FASHION IT IS ADVISABLE TO SKETCH THEM BRIEFLY IN ADVANCE SO THAT EVERYONE MAY MORE READILY GRASP MY MEANING AS REASON MAKES NO DEMANDS CONTRARY TO NATURE
5185-24767-0014 IT DEMANDS THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD LOVE HIMSELF SHOULD SEEK THAT WHICH IS USEFUL TO HIM I MEAN THAT WHICH IS REALLY USEFUL TO HIM SHOULD DESIRE EVERYTHING WHICH REALLY BRINGS MAN TO GREATER PERFECTION AND SHOULD EACH FOR HIMSELF
5185-24767-0015 ENDEAVOUR AS FAR AS HE CAN TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING THIS IS AS NECESSARILY TRUE AS THAT A WHOLE IS GREATER THAN ITS PART
5185-24767-0016 AGAIN AS VIRTUE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT ACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ONE'S OWN NATURE
5185-24767-0017 AND AS NO ONE ENDEAVOURS TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF HIS OWN NATURE IT FOLLOWS FIRST THAT THE FOUNDATION OF VIRTUE IS THE ENDEAVOUR TO PRESERVE ONE'S OWN BEING AND THAT HAPPINESS CONSISTS
5185-24767-0018 IN MAN'S POWER OF PRESERVING HIS OWN BEING SECONDLY THAT VIRTUE IS TO BE DESIRED FOR ITS OWN SAKE
5185-24767-0019 THAT SUICIDES ARE WEAK MINDED AND ARE OVERCOME BY EXTERNAL CAUSES REPUGNANT TO THEIR NATURE
5185-24767-0020 THAT WE CAN NEVER ARRIVE AT DOING WITHOUT ALL EXTERNAL THINGS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF OUR BEING OR LIVING SO AS TO HAVE NO RELATIONS WITH THINGS WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OURSELVES AGAIN IF WE CONSIDER OUR MIND
5185-24767-0021 WE SEE THAT OUR INTELLECT WOULD BE MORE IMPERFECT IF MIND WERE ALONE AND COULD UNDERSTAND NOTHING BESIDES ITSELF THERE ARE THEN MANY THINGS OUTSIDE OURSELVES WHICH ARE USEFUL TO US AND ARE THEREFORE TO BE DESIRED
5185-24767-0022 OF SUCH NONE CAN BE DISCERNED MORE EXCELLENT THAN THOSE WHICH ARE IN ENTIRE AGREEMENT WITH OUR NATURE FOR IF FOR EXAMPLE TWO INDIVIDUALS OF ENTIRELY THE SAME NATURE ARE UNITED THEY FORM A COMBINATION TWICE AS POWERFUL
5185-24767-0023 AS EITHER OF THEM SINGLY THEREFORE TO MAN THERE IS NOTHING MORE USEFUL THAN MAN NOTHING I REPEAT MORE EXCELLENT FOR PRESERVING THEIR BEING CAN BE WISHED FOR BY MEN THAN THAT ALL SHOULD SO IN ALL POINTS AGREE
5185-24767-0024 OF ALL SHOULD FORM AS IT WERE ONE SINGLE MIND AND ONE SINGLE BODY AND THAT ALL SHOULD WITH ONE CONSENT AS FAR AS THEY ARE ABLE ENDEAVOUR TO PRESERVE THEIR BEING AND ALL WITH ONE CONSENT SEEK WHAT IS USEFUL TO THEM ALL HENCE
5185-24767-0025 MEN WHO ARE GOVERNED BY REASON THAT IS WHO SEEK WHAT IS USEFUL TO THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH REASON DESIRE FOR THEMSELVES NOTHING WHICH THEY DO NOT ALSO DESIRE FOR THE REST OF MANKIND AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE JUST FAITHFUL AND HONOURABLE IN THEIR CONDUCT
5185-24767-0026 SUCH ARE THE DICTATES OF REASON WHICH I PURPOSED THUS BRIEFLY TO INDICATE BEFORE BEGINNING TO PROVE THEM IN GREATER DETAIL I HAVE TAKEN THIS COURSE IN ORDER IF POSSIBLE TO GAIN THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE THAT EVERY MAN
5185-24767-0027 IS BOUND TO SEEK WHAT IS USEFUL FOR HIMSELF IS THE FOUNDATION OF IMPIETY RATHER THAN OF PIETY AND VIRTUE THEREFORE AFTER BRIEFLY SHOWING THAT THE CONTRARY IS THE CASE I GO ON TO PROVE IT BY THE SAME METHOD
5185-24767-0028 AS THAT WHEREBY I HAVE HITHERTO PROCEEDED
5185-24767-0029 EVERY MAN BY THE LAWS OF HIS NATURE NECESSARILY DESIRES OR SHRINKS FROM THAT WHICH HE DEEMS TO BE GOOD OR BAD PROOF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL IS
5185-24767-0030 OR PAIN IN SO FAR AS WE ARE CONSCIOUS THEREOF THEREFORE EVERY MAN NECESSARILY DESIRES WHAT HE THINKS GOOD AND SHRINKS FROM WHAT HE THINKS BAD NOW THIS APPETITE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT MAN'S NATURE OR ESSENCE
5185-24767-0031 THEREFORE EVERY MAN SOLELY BY THE LAWS OF HIS NATURE DESIRES THE ONE
5185-24767-0032 IN OTHER WORDS TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING THE MORE IS HE ENDOWED WITH VIRTUE ON THE CONTRARY IN PROPORTION AS A MAN NEGLECTS TO SEEK WHAT IS USEFUL TO HIM THAT IS TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING HE IS WANTING IN POWER PROOF
5185-24767-0033 VIRTUE IS HUMAN POWER WHICH IS DEFINED SOLELY BY MAN'S ESSENCE
5185-24767-0034 THAT IS WHICH IS DEFINED SOLELY BY THE ENDEAVOUR MADE BY MAN TO PERSIST IN HIS OWN BEING WHEREFORE THE MORE A MAN ENDEAVOURS AND IS ABLE TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING THE MORE IS HE ENDOWED WITH VIRTUE
5185-24767-0035 NEGLECTS TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING HE IS WANTING IN POWER
5185-24767-0036 NOTE NO ONE THEREFORE NEGLECTS SEEKING HIS OWN GOOD OR PRESERVING HIS OWN BEING UNLESS HE BE OVERCOME BY CAUSES EXTERNAL AND FOREIGN TO HIS NATURE NO ONE I SAY FROM THE NECESSITY OF HIS OWN NATURE OR OTHERWISE
5185-24767-0037 THAN UNDER COMPULSION FROM EXTERNAL CAUSES SHRINKS FROM FOOD OR KILLS HIMSELF WHICH LATTER MAY BE DONE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS A MAN FOR INSTANCE KILLS HIMSELF UNDER THE COMPULSION OF ANOTHER MAN WHO TWISTS ROUND HIS RIGHT HAND
5185-24767-0038 AND FORCES HIM TO TURN THE BLADE AGAINST HIS OWN HEART OR AGAIN HE MAY BE COMPELLED LIKE SENECA BY A TYRANT'S COMMAND TO OPEN HIS OWN VEINS THAT IS TO ESCAPE A GREATER EVIL BY INCURRING A LESSER OR LASTLY LATENT EXTERNAL CAUSES
5185-24767-0039 MAY SO DISORDER HIS IMAGINATION AND SO AFFECT HIS BODY THAT IT MAY ASSUME A NATURE CONTRARY TO ITS FORMER ONE AND WHEREOF THE IDEA CANNOT EXIST IN THE MIND
5185-24767-0040 BUT THAT A MAN FROM THE NECESSITY OF HIS OWN NATURE SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO BECOME NON EXISTENT IS AS IMPOSSIBLE AS THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE MADE OUT OF NOTHING
