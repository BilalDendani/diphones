4257-6397-0000 CLEARLY HE WAS ONE OF THOSE INVALUABLE SUBORDINATES WHOM TO POSSESS IS A LEGITIMATE CAUSE OF BOASTING CAPTAIN MITCHELL PLUMED HIMSELF UPON HIS EYE FOR MEN BUT HE WAS NOT SELFISH AND IN THE INNOCENCE OF HIS PRIDE WAS ALREADY DEVELOPING THAT MANIA FOR LENDING YOU
4257-6397-0001 SOONER OR LATER WITH EVERY EUROPEAN IN SULACO AS A SORT OF UNIVERSAL FACTOTUM A PRODIGY OF EFFICIENCY IN HIS OWN SPHERE OF LIFE THE FELLOW IS DEVOTED TO ME BODY AND SOUL CAPTAIN MITCHELL WAS GIVEN TO AFFIRM
4257-6397-0002 AND THOUGH NOBODY PERHAPS COULD HAVE EXPLAINED WHY IT SHOULD BE SO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE ON A SURVEY OF THEIR RELATION TO THROW DOUBT ON THAT STATEMENT UNLESS INDEED ONE WERE A BITTER ECCENTRIC CHARACTER LIKE DOCTOR MONYGHAM FOR INSTANCE
4257-6397-0003 WHOSE SHORT HOPELESS LAUGH EXPRESSED SOMEHOW AN IMMENSE MISTRUST OF MANKIND NOT THAT DOCTOR MONYGHAM WAS A PRODIGAL EITHER OF LAUGHTER OR OF WORDS HE WAS BITTERLY TACITURN WHEN AT HIS BEST
4257-6397-0004 AT HIS WORST PEOPLE FEARED THE OPEN SCORNFULNESS OF HIS TONGUE ONLY MISSUS GOULD COULD KEEP HIS UNBELIEF IN MEN'S MOTIVES WITHIN DUE BOUNDS BUT EVEN TO HER ON AN OCCASION NOT CONNECTED WITH NOSTROMO AND IN A TONE WHICH FOR HIM WAS GENTLE
4257-6397-0005 EVEN TO HER HE HAD SAID ONCE REALLY IT IS MOST UNREASONABLE TO DEMAND THAT A MAN SHOULD THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE SO MUCH BETTER THAN HE IS ABLE TO THINK OF HIMSELF AND MISSUS GOULD HAD HASTENED TO DROP THE SUBJECT
4257-6397-0006 THERE WERE STRANGE RUMOURS OF THE ENGLISH DOCTOR YEARS AGO IN THE TIME OF GUZMAN BENTO HE HAD BEEN MIXED UP IT WAS WHISPERED IN A CONSPIRACY WHICH WAS BETRAYED AND AS PEOPLE EXPRESSED IT DROWNED IN BLOOD
4257-6397-0007 THE LARGE CHECK PATTERN OF HIS FLANNEL SHIRT AND HIS OLD STAINED PANAMA HAT WERE AN ESTABLISHED DEFIANCE TO THE CONVENTIONALITIES OF SULACO HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE IMMACULATE CLEANLINESS OF HIS APPAREL HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THOSE SHIFTLESS EUROPEANS
4257-6397-0008 THAT ARE A MORAL EYESORE TO THE RESPECTABILITY OF A FOREIGN COLONY IN ALMOST EVERY EXOTIC PART OF THE WORLD THE YOUNG LADIES OF SULACO ADORNING WITH CLUSTERS OF PRETTY FACES THE BALCONIES ALONG THE STREET OF THE CONSTITUTION WHEN THEY SAW HIM PASS
4257-6397-0009 WITH HIS LIMPING GAIT AND BOWED HEAD A SHORT LINEN JACKET DRAWN ON CARELESSLY OVER THE FLANNEL CHECK SHIRT WOULD REMARK TO EACH OTHER HERE IS THE SENOR DOCTOR GOING TO CALL ON DONA EMILIA HE HAS GOT HIS LITTLE COAT ON THE INFERENCE WAS TRUE
4257-6397-0010 ITS DEEPER MEANING WAS HIDDEN FROM THEIR SIMPLE INTELLIGENCE
4257-6397-0011 HE WAS OLD UGLY LEARNED AND A LITTLE LOCO MAD IF NOT A BIT OF A SORCERER AS THE COMMON PEOPLE SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING
4257-6397-0012 THE LITTLE WHITE JACKET WAS IN REALITY A CONCESSION TO MISSUS GOULD'S HUMANIZING INFLUENCE THE DOCTOR WITH HIS HABIT OF SCEPTICAL BITTER SPEECH HAD NO OTHER MEANS OF SHOWING HIS PROFOUND RESPECT FOR THE CHARACTER OF THE WOMAN
4257-6397-0013 WHO WAS KNOWN IN THE COUNTRY AS THE ENGLISH SENORA HE PRESENTED THIS TRIBUTE VERY SERIOUSLY INDEED IT WAS NO TRIFLE FOR A MAN OF HIS HABITS MISSUS GOULD FELT THAT TOO PERFECTLY
4257-6397-0014 SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IMPOSING UPON HIM THIS MARKED SHOW OF DEFERENCE SHE KEPT HER OLD SPANISH HOUSE ONE OF THE FINEST SPECIMENS IN SULACO OPEN FOR THE DISPENSATION OF THE SMALL GRACES OF EXISTENCE
4257-6397-0015 BECAUSE SHE WAS GUIDED BY AN ALERT PERCEPTION OF VALUES SHE WAS HIGHLY GIFTED IN THE ART OF HUMAN INTERCOURSE WHICH CONSISTS IN DELICATE SHADES OF SELF FORGETFULNESS AND IN THE SUGGESTION OF UNIVERSAL COMPREHENSION CHARLES GOULD THE GOULD FAMILY
4257-6397-0016 ESTABLISHED IN COSTAGUANA FOR THREE GENERATIONS
4257-6397-0017 IMAGINED THAT HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A GIRL'S SOUND COMMON SENSE LIKE ANY OTHER MAN BUT THESE WERE NOT EXACTLY THE REASONS WHY FOR INSTANCE THE WHOLE SURVEYING CAMP
4257-6397-0018 TO THEIR MATURE CHIEF SHOULD HAVE FOUND OCCASION TO ALLUDE TO MISSUS GOULD'S HOUSE SO FREQUENTLY
4257-6397-0019 SHE WOULD HAVE PROTESTED THAT SHE HAD DONE NOTHING FOR THEM WITH A LOW LAUGH AND A SURPRISED WIDENING OF HER GREY EYES HAD ANYBODY TOLD HER HOW CONVINCINGLY SHE WAS REMEMBERED ON THE EDGE OF THE SNOW LINE ABOVE SULACO BUT DIRECTLY
4257-6397-0020 WITH A LITTLE CAPABLE AIR OF SETTING HER WITS TO WORK SHE WOULD HAVE FOUND AN EXPLANATION OF COURSE IT WAS SUCH A SURPRISE FOR THESE BOYS TO FIND ANY SORT OF WELCOME HERE AND I SUPPOSE THEY ARE HOMESICK I SUPPOSE EVERYBODY MUST BE ALWAYS JUST A LITTLE HOMESICK
4257-6397-0021 SHE WAS ALWAYS SORRY FOR HOMESICK PEOPLE BORN IN THE COUNTRY AS HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM SPARE AND TALL WITH A FLAMING MOUSTACHE A NEAT CHIN CLEAR BLUE EYES AUBURN HAIR
4257-6397-0022 AND A THIN FRESH RED FACE CHARLES GOULD LOOKED LIKE A NEW ARRIVAL FROM OVER THE SEA HIS GRANDFATHER HAD FOUGHT IN THE CAUSE OF INDEPENDENCE UNDER BOLIVAR IN THAT FAMOUS ENGLISH LEGION WHICH ON THE BATTLEFIELD OF CARABOBO
4257-6397-0023 HAD BEEN SALUTED BY THE GREAT LIBERATOR AS SAVIOURS OF HIS COUNTRY
4257-6397-0024 THEN CALLED A STATE IN THE DAYS OF FEDERATION AND AFTERWARDS HAD BEEN PUT UP AGAINST THE WALL OF A CHURCH AND SHOT BY THE ORDER OF THE BARBAROUS UNIONIST GENERAL GUZMAN BENTO IT WAS THE SAME GUZMAN BENTO WHO BECOMING LATER PERPETUAL PRESIDENT
4257-6397-0025 FAMED FOR HIS RUTHLESS AND CRUEL TYRANNY READIED HIS APOTHEOSIS IN THE POPULAR LEGEND OF A SANGUINARY LAND HAUNTING SPECTRE WHOSE BODY HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF BY THE DEVIL IN PERSON
4257-6397-0026 THUS AT LEAST THE PRIESTS EXPLAINED ITS DISAPPEARANCE TO THE BAREFOOTED MULTITUDE THAT STREAMED IN AWESTRUCK TO GAZE AT THE HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE UGLY BOX OF BRICKS BEFORE THE GREAT ALTAR GUZMAN BENTO OF CRUEL MEMORY
4257-6397-0027 HAD PUT TO DEATH GREAT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE BESIDES CHARLES GOULD'S UNCLE BUT WITH A RELATIVE MARTYRED IN THE CAUSE OF ARISTOCRACY THE SULACO OLIGARCHS THIS WAS THE PHRASEOLOGY OF GUZMAN BENTO'S TIME NOW THEY WERE CALLED BLANCOS AND HAD GIVEN UP THE FEDERAL IDEA
4257-6397-0028 WHICH MEANT THE FAMILIES OF PURE SPANISH DESCENT CONSIDERED CHARLES AS ONE OF THEMSELVES WITH SUCH A FAMILY RECORD NO ONE COULD BE MORE OF A COSTAGUANERO THAN DON CARLOS GOULD
4257-6397-0029 BUT HIS ASPECT WAS SO CHARACTERISTIC THAT IN THE TALK OF COMMON PEOPLE HE WAS JUST THE INGLEZ THE ENGLISHMAN OF SULACO HE LOOKED MORE ENGLISH THAN A CASUAL TOURIST
4257-6397-0030 HE LOOKED MORE ENGLISH THAN THE LAST ARRIVED BATCH OF YOUNG RAILWAY ENGINEERS THAN ANYBODY OUT OF THE HUNTING FIELD PICTURES IN THE NUMBERS OF PUNCH REACHING HIS WIFE'S DRAWING ROOM TWO MONTHS OR SO AFTER DATE IT ASTONISHED YOU TO HEAR HIM TALK SPANISH
4257-6397-0031 CASTILLAN AS THE NATIVES SAY OR THE INDIAN DIALECT OF THE COUNTRY PEOPLE SO NATURALLY HIS ACCENT HAD NEVER BEEN ENGLISH BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING SO INDELIBLE IN ALL THESE ANCESTRAL GOULDS LIBERATORS EXPLORERS
4257-6397-0032 COFFEE PLANTERS MERCHANTS REVOLUTIONISTS OF COSTAGUANA THAT HE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE THIRD GENERATION IN A CONTINENT POSSESSING ITS OWN STYLE OF HORSEMANSHIP WENT ON LOOKING THOROUGHLY ENGLISH EVEN ON HORSEBACK
4257-6397-0033 THIS IS NOT SAID OF HIM IN THE MOCKING SPIRIT OF THE LLANEROS MEN OF THE GREAT PLAINS WHO THINK THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD KNOWS HOW TO SIT A HORSE BUT THEMSELVES CHARLES GOULD TO USE THE SUITABLY LOFTY PHRASE RODE LIKE A CENTAUR
4257-6397-0034 RIDING FOR HIM WAS NOT A SPECIAL FORM OF EXERCISE IT WAS A NATURAL FACULTY AS WALKING STRAIGHT IS TO ALL MEN SOUND OF MIND AND LIMB BUT ALL THE SAME WHEN CANTERING BESIDE THE RUTTY OX CART TRACK TO THE MINE
4257-6397-0035 HE LOOKED IN HIS ENGLISH CLOTHES AND WITH HIS IMPORTED SADDLERY AS THOUGH HE HAD COME THIS MOMENT TO COSTAGUANA AT HIS EASY SWIFT PASOTROTE STRAIGHT OUT OF SOME GREEN MEADOW AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD HIS WAY WOULD LIE ALONG THE OLD SPANISH ROAD
4257-6397-0036 THE ONLY REMAINING VESTIGE OF A FACT AND NAME LEFT BY THAT ROYALTY OLD GIORGIO VIOLA HATED AND WHOSE VERY SHADOW HAD DEPARTED FROM THE LAND
4257-6397-0037 TOWERING WHITE AGAINST THE TREES WAS ONLY KNOWN TO THE FOLK FROM THE COUNTRY AND TO THE BEGGARS OF THE TOWN THAT SLEPT ON THE STEPS AROUND THE PEDESTAL AS THE HORSE OF STONE THE OTHER CARLOS TURNING OFF TO THE LEFT WITH A RAPID CLATTER OF HOOFS ON THE DISJOINTED PAVEMENT
4257-6397-0038 DON CARLOS GOULD IN HIS ENGLISH CLOTHES LOOKED AS INCONGRUOUS BUT MUCH MORE AT HOME THAN THE KINGLY CAVALIER REINING IN HIS STEED ON THE PEDESTAL ABOVE THE SLEEPING LEPEROS WITH HIS MARBLE ARM RAISED TOWARDS THE MARBLE RIM OF A PLUMED HAT
4257-6397-0039 THE WEATHER STAINED EFFIGY OF THE MOUNTED KING WITH ITS VAGUE SUGGESTION OF A SALUTING GESTURE SEEMED TO PRESENT AN INSCRUTABLE BREAST TO THE POLITICAL CHANGES WHICH HAD ROBBED IT OF ITS VERY NAME BUT NEITHER DID THE OTHER HORSEMAN WELL KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE
4257-6397-0040 KEEN AND ALIVE ON HIS WELL SHAPED SLATE COLOURED BEAST WITH A WHITE EYE WEAR HIS HEART ON THE SLEEVE OF HIS ENGLISH COAT HIS MIND PRESERVED ITS STEADY POISE AS IF SHELTERED IN THE PASSIONLESS STABILITY OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC DECENCIES AT HOME IN EUROPE
4257-6397-0041 HE ACCEPTED WITH A LIKE CALM THE SHOCKING MANNER IN WHICH THE SULACO LADIES SMOTHERED THEIR FACES WITH PEARL POWDER TILL THEY LOOKED LIKE WHITE PLASTER CASTS WITH BEAUTIFUL LIVING EYES THE PECULIAR GOSSIP OF THE TOWN
4257-6397-0042 AND THE CONTINUOUS POLITICAL CHANGES THE CONSTANT SAVING OF THE COUNTRY WHICH TO HIS WIFE SEEMED A PUERILE AND BLOODTHIRSTY GAME OF MURDER AND RAPINE PLAYED WITH TERRIBLE EARNESTNESS BY DEPRAVED CHILDREN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF HER COSTAGUANA LIFE
4257-6397-0043 THE LITTLE LADY USED TO CLENCH HER HANDS WITH EXASPERATION AT NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY AS SERIOUSLY AS THE INCIDENTAL ATROCITY OF METHODS DESERVED SHE SAW IN THEM A COMEDY OF NAIVE PRETENCES
4257-6397-0044 BUT HARDLY ANYTHING GENUINE EXCEPT HER OWN APPALLED INDIGNATION CHARLES VERY QUIET AND TWISTING HIS LONG MOUSTACHES WOULD DECLINE TO DISCUSS THEM AT ALL ONCE HOWEVER HE OBSERVED TO HER GENTLY MY DEAR
4257-6397-0045 YOU SEEM TO FORGET THAT I WAS BORN HERE THESE FEW WORDS MADE HER PAUSE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN A SUDDEN REVELATION PERHAPS THE MERE FACT OF BEING BORN IN THE COUNTRY DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE SHE HAD A GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HER HUSBAND IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY GREAT
4257-6397-0046 HE HAD STRUCK HER IMAGINATION FROM THE FIRST BY HIS UNSENTIMENTALISM BY THAT VERY QUIETUDE OF MIND WHICH SHE HAD ERECTED IN HER THOUGHT FOR A SIGN OF PERFECT COMPETENCY IN THE BUSINESS OF LIVING
4257-6397-0047 USED TO DECLARE IN DONA EMILIA'S DRAWING ROOM THAT CARLOS HAD ALL THE ENGLISH QUALITIES OF CHARACTER WITH A TRULY PATRIOTIC HEART MISSUS GOULD RAISING HER EYES TO HER HUSBAND'S THIN RED AND TAN FACE
4257-6397-0048 COULD NOT DETECT THE SLIGHTEST QUIVER OF A FEATURE AT WHAT HE MUST HAVE HEARD SAID OF HIS PATRIOTISM PERHAPS HE HAD JUST DISMOUNTED ON HIS RETURN FROM THE MINE HE WAS ENGLISH ENOUGH TO DISREGARD THE HOTTEST HOURS OF THE DAY
4257-6397-0049 BASILIO IN A LIVERY OF WHITE LINEN AND A RED SASH HAD SQUATTED FOR A MOMENT BEHIND HIS HEELS TO UNSTRAP THE HEAVY BLUNT SPURS IN THE PATIO AND THEN THE SENOR ADMINISTRATOR WOULD GO UP THE STAIRCASE INTO THE GALLERY
4257-6397-0050 ROWS OF PLANTS IN POTS RANGED ON THE BALUSTRADE BETWEEN THE PILASTERS OF THE ARCHES
4257-6397-0051 WHOSE PAVED SPACE IS THE TRUE HEARTHSTONE OF A SOUTH AMERICAN HOUSE WHERE THE QUIET HOURS OF DOMESTIC LIFE ARE MARKED BY THE SHIFTING OF LIGHT AND SHADOW ON THE FLAGSTONES
4257-6397-0052 SENOR AVELLANOS WAS IN THE HABIT OF CROSSING THE PATIO AT FIVE O'CLOCK ALMOST EVERY DAY DON JOSE CHOSE TO COME OVER AT TEA TIME BECAUSE THE ENGLISH RITE AT DONA EMILIA'S HOUSE REMINDED HIM OF THE TIME HE LIVED IN LONDON
4257-6397-0053 AS MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY TO THE COURT OF SAINT JAMES HE DID NOT LIKE TEA AND USUALLY ROCKING HIS AMERICAN CHAIR HIS NEAT LITTLE SHINY BOOTS CROSSED ON THE FOOT REST HE WOULD TALK ON AND ON
4257-6397-0054 WITH A SORT OF COMPLACENT VIRTUOSITY WONDERFUL IN A MAN OF HIS AGE WHILE HE HELD THE CUP IN HIS HANDS FOR A LONG TIME HIS CLOSE CROPPED HEAD WAS PERFECTLY WHITE HIS EYES COALBLACK ON SEEING CHARLES GOULD STEP INTO THE SALA
4257-6397-0055 HE WOULD NOD PROVISIONALLY AND GO ON TO THE END OF THE ORATORIAL PERIOD ONLY THEN HE WOULD SAY CARLOS MY FRIEND
4257-6397-0056 ALWAYS THE TRUE ENGLISH ACTIVITY NO WHAT HE DRANK UP ALL THE TEA AT ONCE IN ONE DRAUGHT THIS PERFORMANCE WAS INVARIABLY FOLLOWED BY A SLIGHT SHUDDER AND A LOW INVOLUNTARY BR R R R WHICH WAS NOT COVERED BY THE HASTY EXCLAMATION
4257-6397-0057 EXCELLENT THEN GIVING UP THE EMPTY CUP INTO HIS YOUNG FRIEND'S HAND EXTENDED WITH A SMILE
4257-6397-0058 FOR THE SIMPLE PLEASURE OF TALKING FLUENTLY IT SEEMED WHILE HIS RECLINING BODY JERKED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN A ROCKING CHAIR OF THE SORT EXPORTED FROM THE UNITED STATES THE CEILING OF THE LARGEST DRAWING ROOM OF THE CASA GOULD EXTENDED ITS WHITE LEVEL FAR ABOVE HIS HEAD
4257-6397-0059 THE LOFTINESS DWARFED THE MIXTURE OF HEAVY STRAIGHT BACKED SPANISH CHAIRS OF BROWN WOOD WITH LEATHERN SEATS AND EUROPEAN FURNITURE LOW AND CUSHIONED ALL OVER LIKE SQUAT LITTLE MONSTERS GORGED TO BURSTING WITH STEEL SPRINGS AND HORSEHAIR
4257-6397-0060 THERE WERE KNICK KNACKS ON LITTLE TABLES MIRRORS LET INTO THE WALL ABOVE MARBLE CONSOLES SQUARE SPACES OF CARPET UNDER THE TWO GROUPS OF ARMCHAIRS EACH PRESIDED OVER BY A DEEP SOFA SMALLER RUGS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE FLOOR OF RED TILES
4257-6397-0061 THREE WINDOWS FROM THE CEILING DOWN TO THE GROUND OPENING ON A BALCONY AND FLANKED BY THE PERPENDICULAR FOLDS OF THE DARK HANGINGS THE STATELINESS OF ANCIENT DAYS LINGERED BETWEEN THE FOUR HIGH SMOOTH WALLS
4257-6397-0062 AND MISSUS GOULD WITH HER LITTLE HEAD AND SHINING COILS OF HAIR SITTING IN A CLOUD OF MUSLIN AND LACE BEFORE A SLENDER MAHOGANY TABLE RESEMBLED A FAIRY POSED LIGHTLY BEFORE DAINTY PHILTRES DISPENSED OUT OF VESSELS OF SILVER AND PORCELAIN
4257-6397-0063 WORKED IN THE EARLY DAYS MOSTLY BY MEANS OF LASHES ON THE BACKS OF SLAVES ITS YIELD HAD BEEN PAID FOR IN ITS OWN WEIGHT OF HUMAN BONES WHOLE TRIBES OF INDIANS HAD PERISHED IN THE EXPLOITATION AND THEN THE MINE WAS ABANDONED
4257-6397-0064 SINCE WITH THIS PRIMITIVE METHOD IT HAD CEASED TO MAKE A PROFITABLE RETURN NO MATTER HOW MANY CORPSES WERE THROWN INTO ITS MAW THEN IT BECAME FORGOTTEN IT WAS REDISCOVERED AFTER THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE AN ENGLISH COMPANY OBTAINED THE RIGHT TO WORK IT
4257-6397-0065 AND FOUND SO RICH A VEIN THAT NEITHER THE EXACTIONS OF SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS NOR THE PERIODICAL RAIDS OF RECRUITING OFFICERS UPON THE POPULATION OF PAID MINERS THEY HAD CREATED COULD DISCOURAGE THEIR PERSEVERANCE BUT IN THE END
4257-6397-0066 DURING THE LONG TURMOIL OF PRONUNCIAMENTOS THAT FOLLOWED THE DEATH OF THE FAMOUS GUZMAN BENTO THE NATIVE MINERS INCITED TO REVOLT BY THE EMISSARIES SENT OUT FROM THE CAPITAL HAD RISEN UPON THEIR ENGLISH CHIEFS AND MURDERED THEM TO A MAN
4257-6397-0067 BEGAN WITH THE WORDS JUSTLY INCENSED AT THE GRINDING OPPRESSION OF FOREIGNERS ACTUATED BY SORDID MOTIVES OF GAIN RATHER THAN BY LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY COME IMPOVERISHED TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNES
4257-6397-0068 AND ENDED WITH THE DECLARATION THE CHIEF OF THE STATE HAS RESOLVED TO EXERCISE TO THE FULL HIS POWER OF CLEMENCY THE MINE WHICH BY EVERY LAW INTERNATIONAL HUMAN AND DIVINE REVERTS NOW TO THE GOVERNMENT AS NATIONAL PROPERTY
4257-6397-0069 SHALL REMAIN CLOSED TILL THE SWORD DRAWN FOR THE SACRED DEFENCE OF LIBERAL PRINCIPLES HAS ACCOMPLISHED ITS MISSION OF SECURING THE HAPPINESS OF OUR BELOVED COUNTRY
4257-6397-0070 WHAT ADVANTAGE THAT GOVERNMENT HAD EXPECTED FROM THE SPOLIATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL NOW COSTAGUANA WAS MADE WITH DIFFICULTY TO PAY A BEGGARLY MONEY COMPENSATION TO THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS
4257-6397-0071 BUT AFTERWARDS ANOTHER GOVERNMENT BETHOUGHT ITSELF OF THAT VALUABLE ASSET IT WAS AN ORDINARY COSTAGUANA GOVERNMENT THE FOURTH IN SIX YEARS BUT IT JUDGED OF ITS OPPORTUNITIES SANELY
4257-6397-0072 BUT WITH AN INGENIOUS INSIGHT INTO THE VARIOUS USES A SILVER MINE CAN BE PUT TO APART FROM THE SORDID PROCESS OF EXTRACTING THE METAL FROM UNDER THE GROUND THE FATHER OF CHARLES GOULD FOR A LONG TIME ONE OF THE MOST WEALTHY MERCHANTS OF COSTAGUANA
4257-6397-0073 HAD ALREADY LOST A CONSIDERABLE PART OF HIS FORTUNE IN FORCED LOANS TO THE SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS HE WAS A MAN OF CALM JUDGMENT WHO NEVER DREAMED OF PRESSING HIS CLAIMS AND WHEN SUDDENLY
4257-6397-0074 HIS ALARM BECAME EXTREME HE WAS VERSED IN THE WAYS OF GOVERNMENTS INDEED THE INTENTION OF THIS AFFAIR THOUGH NO DOUBT DEEPLY MEDITATED IN THE CLOSET LAY OPEN ON THE SURFACE OF THE DOCUMENT PRESENTED URGENTLY FOR HIS SIGNATURE
4257-6397-0075 THE THIRD AND MOST IMPORTANT CLAUSE STIPULATED THAT THE CONCESSION HOLDER SHOULD PAY AT ONCE TO THE GOVERNMENT FIVE YEARS ROYALTIES ON THE ESTIMATED OUTPUT OF THE MINE MISTER GOULD SENIOR
4257-6397-0076 DEFENDED HIMSELF FROM THIS FATAL FAVOUR WITH MANY ARGUMENTS AND ENTREATIES BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS HE KNEW NOTHING OF MINING
4257-6397-0077 THE MINE AS A WORKING CONCERN DID NOT EXIST THE BUILDINGS HAD BEEN BURNT DOWN THE MINING PLANT HAD BEEN DESTROYED THE MINING POPULATION HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD YEARS AND YEARS AGO
4257-6397-0078 THE VERY ROAD HAD VANISHED UNDER A FLOOD OF TROPICAL VEGETATION AS EFFECTUALLY AS IF SWALLOWED BY THE SEA AND THE MAIN GALLERY HAD FALLEN IN WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE ENTRANCE IT WAS NO LONGER AN ABANDONED MINE IT WAS A WILD
4257-6397-0079 INACCESSIBLE AND ROCKY GORGE OF THE SIERRA WHERE VESTIGES OF CHARRED TIMBER SOME HEAPS OF SMASHED BRICKS AND A FEW SHAPELESS PIECES OF RUSTY IRON COULD HAVE BEEN FOUND UNDER THE MATTED MASS OF THORNY CREEPERS COVERING THE GROUND MISTER GOULD
4257-6397-0080 SENIOR DID NOT DESIRE THE PERPETUAL POSSESSION OF THAT DESOLATE LOCALITY IN FACT THE MERE VISION OF IT ARISING BEFORE HIS MIND IN THE STILL WATCHES OF THE NIGHT HAD THE POWER TO EXASPERATE HIM INTO HOURS OF HOT AND AGITATED INSOMNIA
4257-6397-0081 IT SO HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT THE FINANCE MINISTER OF THE TIME WAS A MAN TO WHOM IN YEARS GONE BY MISTER GOULD HAD UNFORTUNATELY DECLINED TO GRANT SOME SMALL PECUNIARY ASSISTANCE
4257-6397-0082 BASING HIS REFUSAL ON THE GROUND THAT THE APPLICANT WAS A NOTORIOUS GAMBLER AND CHEAT BESIDES BEING MORE THAN HALF SUSPECTED OF A ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE ON A WEALTHY RANCHERO IN A REMOTE COUNTRY DISTRICT WHERE HE WAS ACTUALLY EXERCISING THE FUNCTION OF A JUDGE
4257-6397-0083 NOW AFTER REACHING HIS EXALTED POSITION THAT POLITICIAN HAD PROCLAIMED HIS INTENTION TO REPAY EVIL WITH GOOD TO SENOR GOULD THE POOR MAN
4257-6397-0084 AND WITH SUCH MALICIOUS GLANCES THAT MISTER GOULD'S BEST FRIENDS ADVISED HIM EARNESTLY TO ATTEMPT NO BRIBERY TO GET THE MATTER DROPPED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS INDEED IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A VERY SAFE PROCEEDING SUCH WAS ALSO THE OPINION OF A STOUT
4257-6397-0085 LOUD VOICED LADY OF FRENCH EXTRACTION THE DAUGHTER SHE SAID OF AN OFFICER OF HIGH RANK
4257-6397-0086 WHO WAS ACCOMMODATED WITH LODGINGS WITHIN THE WALLS OF A SECULARIZED CONVENT NEXT DOOR TO THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE THAT FLORID PERSON WHEN APPROACHED ON BEHALF OF MISTER GOULD IN A PROPER MANNER AND WITH A SUITABLE PRESENT SHOOK HER HEAD DESPONDENTLY
4257-6397-0087 SHE WAS GOOD NATURED AND HER DESPONDENCY WAS GENUINE SHE IMAGINED SHE COULD NOT TAKE MONEY IN CONSIDERATION OF SOMETHING SHE COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH THE FRIEND OF MISTER GOULD CHARGED WITH THE DELICATE MISSION
4257-6397-0088 USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY HONEST PERSON CLOSELY OR REMOTELY CONNECTED WITH THE GOVERNMENT HE HAD EVER MET NO GO SHE HAD SAID WITH A CAVALIER HUSKY INTONATION
4257-6397-0089 AND IT WAS AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN COMPOUNDED OF SOME SUBTLE POISON THAT ACTED DIRECTLY ON HIS BRAIN HE BECAME AT ONCE MINE RIDDEN AND AS HE WAS WELL READ IN LIGHT LITERATURE IT TOOK TO HIS MIND THE FORM OF THE OLD MAN OF THE SEA FASTENED UPON HIS SHOULDERS
4257-6397-0090 HE ALSO BEGAN TO DREAM OF VAMPIRES MISTER GOULD EXAGGERATED TO HIMSELF THE DISADVANTAGES OF HIS NEW POSITION BECAUSE HE VIEWED IT EMOTIONALLY HIS POSITION IN COSTAGUANA WAS NO WORSE THAN BEFORE BUT MAN IS A DESPERATELY CONSERVATIVE CREATURE
4257-6397-0091 AND THE EXTRAVAGANT NOVELTY OF THIS OUTRAGE UPON HIS PURSE DISTRESSED HIS SENSIBILITIES EVERYBODY AROUND HIM WAS BEING ROBBED BY THE GROTESQUE AND MURDEROUS BANDS THAT PLAYED THEIR GAME OF GOVERNMENTS AND REVOLUTIONS AFTER THE DEATH OF GUZMAN BENTO
4257-6397-0092 HIS EXPERIENCE HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT HOWEVER SHORT THE PLUNDER MIGHT FALL OF THEIR LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS NO GANG IN POSSESSION OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE WOULD BE SO INCOMPETENT AS TO SUFFER ITSELF TO BE BAFFLED BY THE WANT OF A PRETEXT
4257-6397-0093 THE FIRST CASUAL COLONEL OF THE BAREFOOTED ARMY OF SCARECROWS THAT CAME ALONG WAS ABLE TO EXPOSE WITH FORCE AND PRECISION TO ANY MERE CIVILIAN HIS TITLES TO A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THE WHILE HIS HOPE WOULD BE IMMUTABLY FIXED UPON A GRATUITY AT ANY RATE
4257-6397-0094 OF NO LESS THAN A THOUSAND MISTER GOULD KNEW THAT VERY WELL AND ARMED WITH RESIGNATION HAD WAITED FOR BETTER TIMES BUT TO BE ROBBED UNDER THE FORMS OF LEGALITY AND BUSINESS WAS INTOLERABLE TO HIS IMAGINATION
4257-6397-0095 MISTER GOULD THE FATHER HAD ONE FAULT IN HIS SAGACIOUS AND HONOURABLE CHARACTER HE ATTACHED TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO FORM IT IS A FAILING COMMON TO MANKIND WHOSE VIEWS ARE TINGED BY PREJUDICES
4257-6397-0096 THERE WAS FOR HIM IN THAT AFFAIR A MALIGNANCY OF PERVERTED JUSTICE WHICH BY MEANS OF A MORAL SHOCK ATTACKED HIS VIGOROUS PHYSIQUE IT WILL END BY KILLING ME HE USED TO AFFIRM MANY TIMES A DAY AND IN FACT SINCE THAT TIME
4257-6397-0097 HE BEGAN TO SUFFER FROM FEVER FROM LIVER PAINS AND MOSTLY FROM A WORRYING INABILITY TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THE FINANCE MINISTER COULD HAVE FORMED NO CONCEPTION OF THE PROFOUND SUBTLETY OF HIS REVENGE
4257-6397-0098 EVEN MISTER GOULD'S LETTERS TO HIS FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY CHARLES THEN AWAY IN ENGLAND FOR HIS EDUCATION CAME AT LAST TO TALK OF PRACTICALLY NOTHING BUT THE MINE HE GROANED OVER THE INJUSTICE THE PERSECUTION
4257-6397-0099 THE OUTRAGE OF THAT MINE HE OCCUPIED WHOLE PAGES IN THE EXPOSITION OF THE FATAL CONSEQUENCES ATTACHING TO THE POSSESSION OF THAT MINE FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW WITH EVERY DISMAL INFERENCE WITH WORDS OF HORROR AT THE APPARENTLY ETERNAL CHARACTER OF THAT CURSE
4257-6397-0100 FOR THE CONCESSION HAD BEEN GRANTED TO HIM AND HIS DESCENDANTS FOR EVER HE IMPLORED HIS SON NEVER TO RETURN TO COSTAGUANA NEVER TO CLAIM ANY PART OF HIS INHERITANCE THERE BECAUSE IT WAS TAINTED BY THE INFAMOUS CONCESSION NEVER TO TOUCH IT
4257-6397-0101 NEVER TO APPROACH IT TO FORGET THAT AMERICA EXISTED AND PURSUE A MERCANTILE CAREER IN EUROPE
