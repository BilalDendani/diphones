6484-67787-0000 HE WAS DECENTLY CIVIL IF NOT ENTHUSIASTIC DURING THE FEW REMAINING HOURS OF HIS STAY
6484-67787-0001 HE DID NOT FIND HER PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME WHEN SHE WAS AWAY FROM HER LADYSHIP'S SIDE WHEN SHE CAME OUT TO HIM IN HER SIMPLE COTTON GOWN AND STRAW HAT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT SHE WAS MUCH PRETTIER THAN HE HAD THOUGHT HER AT FIRST
6484-67787-0002 FOR ECONOMICAL REASONS SHE HAD MADE THE LITTLE MORNING DRESS HERSELF WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD FOR THE DESIGNS OF MISS CHICKIE AND AS IT WAS NOT TRIMMED AT ALL AND HAD ONLY A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AT THE WAIST
6484-67787-0003 THERE WAS NOTHING TO PLACE HER CHARMING FIGURE AT A DISADVANTAGE IT COULD NOT BE SAID THAT HER SHYNESS AND SIMPLICITY DELIGHTED CAPTAIN BAROLD BUT AT LEAST THEY DID NOT DISPLEASE HIM AND THIS WAS REALLY AS MUCH AS COULD BE EXPECTED
6484-67787-0004 SHE DOES NOT EXPECT A FELLOW TO EXERT HIMSELF AT ALL EVENTS WAS HIS INWARD COMMENT AND HE DID NOT EXERT HIMSELF BUT WHEN ON THE POINT OF TAKING HIS DEPARTURE HE WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE A VERY GRACIOUS REMARK TO HER
6484-67787-0005 I HOPE WE SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU IN LONDON FOR A SEASON BEFORE VERY LONG HE SAID MY MOTHER WILL HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN TAKING CHARGE OF YOU IF LADY THEOBALD CANNOT BE INDUCED TO LEAVE SLOWBRIDGE LUCIA NEVER GOES FROM HOME ALONE
6484-67787-0006 SAID LADY THEOBALD BUT I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE OBLIGED TO CALL UPON YOUR MOTHER FOR HER GOOD OFFICES IN THE CASE OF OUR SPENDING A SEASON IN LONDON I AM TOO OLD A WOMAN TO ALTER MY MODE OF LIFE ALTOGETHER IN OBEDIENCE TO HER LADYSHIP'S ORDERS
6484-67787-0007 THE VENERABLE LANDAU WAS BROUGHT TO THE DOOR AND THE TWO LADIES DROVE TO THE STATION WITH HIM IT WAS DURING THIS DRIVE THAT A VERY CURIOUS INCIDENT OCCURRED AN INCIDENT TO WHICH PERHAPS THIS STORY OWES ITS EXISTENCE
6484-67787-0008 SINCE IF IT HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE THERE MIGHT VERY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN NO EVENTS OF A STIRRING NATURE TO CHRONICLE JUST AS DOBSON DROVE RATHER SLOWLY UP THE PART OF HIGH STREET DISTINGUISHED BY THE PRESENCE OF MISS BELINDA BASSETT'S HOUSE
6484-67787-0009 CAPTAIN BAROLD SUDDENLY APPEARED TO BE ATTRACTED BY SOME FIGURE HE DISCOVERED IN THE GARDEN APPERTAINING TO THAT MODEST STRUCTURE BY JOVE HE EXCLAIMED IN AN UNDERTONE THERE IS MISS OCTAVIA
6484-67787-0010 FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS ALMOST ROUSED TO A DISPLAY OF INTEREST A FAINT SMILE LIGHTED HIS FACE AND HIS COLD HANDSOME EYES SLIGHTLY BRIGHTENED LADY THEOBALD SAT BOLT UPRIGHT
6484-67787-0011 THAT IS MISS BASSETT'S NIECE FROM AMERICA SHE SAID DO I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW HER CAPTAIN BAROLD TURNED TO CONFRONT HER EVIDENTLY ANNOYED AT HAVING ALLOWED A SURPRISE TO GET THE BETTER OF HIM ALL EXPRESSION DIED OUT OF HIS FACE
6484-67787-0012 I TRAVELLED WITH HER FROM FRAMWICH TO STAMFORD HE SAID I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD HAVE REACHED SLOWBRIDGE TOGETHER BUT THAT I DROPPED OFF AT STAMFORD TO GET A NEWSPAPER AND THE TRAIN LEFT ME BEHIND
6484-67787-0013 HOW VERY PRETTY SHE IS MISS OCTAVIA CERTAINLY WAS AMAZINGLY SO THIS MORNING
6484-67787-0014 AND WAS DRESSED IN A CASHMERE MORNING ROBE OF THE FINEST TEXTURE AND THE FAINTEST PINK
6484-67787-0015 JABOT OF LACE DOWN THE FRONT AND THE CLOSE HIGH FRILLS OF LACE AROUND THE THROAT WHICH SEEMED TO BE A WEAKNESS WITH HER HER HAIR WAS DRESSED HIGH UPON HER HEAD AND SHOWED TO ADVANTAGE HER LITTLE EARS
6484-67787-0016 AND AS MUCH OF HER SLIM WHITE NECK AS THE FRILLS DID NOT CONCEAL
6484-67787-0017 SHE LOOKS LIKE AN ACTRESS SHE SAID IF THE TREES WERE PAINTED CANVAS AND THE ROSES ARTIFICIAL ONE MIGHT HAVE SOME PATIENCE WITH HER THAT KIND OF THING IS SCARCELY WHAT WE EXPECT IN SLOWBRIDGE THEN SHE TURNED TO BAROLD I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING HER YESTERDAY
6484-67787-0018 NOT LONG AFTER SHE ARRIVED SHE SAID SHE HAD DIAMONDS IN HER EARS AS BIG AS PEAS AND RINGS TO MATCH HER MANNER IS JUST WHAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT FROM A YOUNG WOMAN BROUGHT UP AMONG GOLD DIGGERS AND SILVER MINERS
6484-67787-0019 IT STRUCK ME AS BEING A VERY UNIQUE AND INTERESTING MANNER SAID CAPTAIN BAROLD IT IS CHIEFLY NOTICEABLE FOR A SANG FROID WHICH MIGHT BE REGARDED AS RATHER ENVIABLE SHE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT HER PAPA AND THE SILVER MINES
6484-67787-0020 AND I REALLY FOUND THE CONVERSATION ENTERTAINING IT IS SCARCELY CUSTOMARY FOR ENGLISH YOUNG WOMEN TO CONFIDE IN THEIR MASCULINE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS TO SUCH AN EXTENT REMARKED MY LADY GRIMLY
6484-67787-0021 SHE DID NOT CONFIDE IN ME AT ALL SAID BAROLD THEREIN LAY HER ATTRACTION ONE CANNOT SUBMIT TO BEING CONFIDED IN BY A STRANGE YOUNG WOMAN HOWEVER CHARMING THIS YOUNG LADY'S REMARKS WERE FLAVORED SOLELY
6484-67787-0022 AND AS HE LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT HE STILL LOOKED AT THE PICTURESQUE FIGURE WHICH THEY HAD PASSED AS IF HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SORRY TO SEE IT TURN ITS HEAD TOWARD HIM IN FACT IT SEEMED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS USUAL GOOD FORTUNE
6484-67787-0023 CAPTAIN BAROLD WAS DOOMED THIS MORNING TO MAKE REMARKS OF A NATURE OBJECTIONABLE TO HIS REVERED RELATION
6484-67787-0024 WHICH WAS AT WORK IN ALL ITS VIGOR WITH A WHIR AND BUZZ OF MACHINERY AND A SLIGHT ODOR OF OIL IN ITS SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE AH SAID MISTER BAROLD PUTTING HIS SINGLE EYEGLASS INTO HIS EYE AND SCANNING IT AFTER THE MANNER OF EXPERTS
6484-67787-0025 I DID NOT THINK YOU HAD ANY THING OF THAT SORT HERE WHO PUT IT UP THE MAN'S NAME REPLIED LADY THEOBALD SEVERELY IS BURMISTONE PRETTY GOOD IDEA ISN'T IT REMARKED BAROLD GOOD FOR THE PLACE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING TO MY MIND
6484-67787-0026 MISTER FRANCIS BAROLD DROPPED HIS EYEGLASS DEXTEROUSLY AND AT ONCE LAPSED INTO HIS NORMAL CONDITION WHICH WAS A CONDITION BY NO MEANS FAVORABLE TO ARGUMENT THINK SO HE SAID SLOWLY
6484-67787-0027 PITY ISN'T IT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND REALLY THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL FOR HER LADYSHIP TO DO BUT PRESERVE A LOFTY SILENCE
6484-67787-0028 AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO SAY FAREWELL AS COMPLACENTLY AS POSSIBLE WE WILL HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN BEFORE MANY DAYS SHE SAID WITH DIGNITY IF NOT WITH WARMTH MISTER FRANCIS BAROLD WAS SILENT FOR A SECOND
6484-67787-0029 AND A SLIGHTLY REFLECTIVE EXPRESSION FLITTED ACROSS HIS FACE THANKS YES HE SAID AT LAST CERTAINLY IT IS EASY TO COME DOWN AND I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF SLOWBRIDGE WHEN THE TRAIN HAD PUFFED IN AND OUT OF THE STATION
6484-67787-0030 AND DOBSON WAS DRIVING DOWN HIGH STREET AGAIN HER LADYSHIP'S FEELINGS RATHER GOT THE BETTER OF HER IF BELINDA BASSETT IS A WISE WOMAN SHE REMARKED SHE WILL TAKE MY ADVICE AND GET RID OF THIS YOUNG LADY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
6484-67787-0031 IT APPEARS TO ME SHE CONTINUED WITH EXALTED PIETY THAT EVERY WELL TRAINED ENGLISH GIRL HAS REASON TO THANK HER MAKER THAT SHE WAS BORN IN A CIVILIZED LAND
6484-67787-0032 MISS OCTAVIA BASSETT HAS HAD NO ONE TO TRAIN HER AT ALL AND IT MAY BE THAT THAT SHE EVEN FEELS IT DEEPLY THE FEATHERS IN HER LADYSHIP'S BONNET TREMBLED
