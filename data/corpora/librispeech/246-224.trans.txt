246-224-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING VERY UNEXPECTED LETTER FROM ISABELLA BATH APRIL MY DEAREST CATHERINE
246-224-0001 I RECEIVED YOUR TWO KIND LETTERS WITH THE GREATEST DELIGHT AND HAVE A THOUSAND APOLOGIES TO MAKE FOR NOT ANSWERING THEM SOONER I REALLY AM QUITE ASHAMED OF MY IDLENESS BUT IN THIS HORRID PLACE ONE CAN FIND TIME FOR NOTHING
246-224-0002 I HAVE HAD MY PEN IN MY HAND TO BEGIN A LETTER TO YOU ALMOST EVERY DAY SINCE YOU LEFT BATH BUT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PREVENTED BY SOME SILLY TRIFLER OR OTHER PRAY WRITE TO ME SOON AND DIRECT TO MY OWN HOME
246-224-0003 THANK GOD WE LEAVE THIS VILE PLACE TOMORROW SINCE YOU WENT AWAY I HAVE HAD NO PLEASURE IN IT THE DUST IS BEYOND ANYTHING AND EVERYBODY ONE CARES FOR IS GONE I BELIEVE IF I COULD SEE YOU I SHOULD NOT MIND THE REST
246-224-0004 FOR YOU ARE DEARER TO ME THAN ANYBODY CAN CONCEIVE I AM QUITE UNEASY ABOUT YOUR DEAR BROTHER NOT HAVING HEARD FROM HIM SINCE HE WENT TO OXFORD AND AM FEARFUL OF SOME MISUNDERSTANDING YOUR KIND OFFICES WILL SET ALL RIGHT
246-224-0005 HE IS THE ONLY MAN I EVER DID OR COULD LOVE AND I TRUST YOU WILL CONVINCE HIM OF IT THE SPRING FASHIONS ARE PARTLY DOWN AND THE HATS THE MOST FRIGHTFUL YOU CAN IMAGINE I HOPE YOU SPEND YOUR TIME PLEASANTLY
246-224-0006 BUT AM AFRAID YOU NEVER THINK OF ME I WILL NOT SAY ALL THAT I COULD OF THE FAMILY YOU ARE WITH BECAUSE I WOULD NOT BE UNGENEROUS OR SET YOU AGAINST THOSE YOU ESTEEM BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHOM TO TRUST
246-224-0007 AND YOUNG MEN NEVER KNOW THEIR MINDS TWO DAYS TOGETHER I REJOICE TO SAY THAT THE YOUNG MAN WHOM OF ALL OTHERS I PARTICULARLY ABHOR HAS LEFT BATH YOU WILL KNOW FROM THIS DESCRIPTION I MUST MEAN CAPTAIN TILNEY
246-224-0008 WHO AS YOU MAY REMEMBER WAS AMAZINGLY DISPOSED TO FOLLOW AND TEASE ME BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY AFTERWARDS HE GOT WORSE AND BECAME QUITE MY SHADOW MANY GIRLS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN FOR NEVER WERE SUCH ATTENTIONS
246-224-0009 BUT I KNEW THE FICKLE SEX TOO WELL HE WENT AWAY TO HIS REGIMENT TWO DAYS AGO AND I TRUST I SHALL NEVER BE PLAGUED WITH HIM AGAIN HE IS THE GREATEST COXCOMB I EVER SAW AND AMAZINGLY DISAGREEABLE
246-224-0010 THE LAST TWO DAYS HE WAS ALWAYS BY THE SIDE OF CHARLOTTE DAVIS I PITIED HIS TASTE BUT TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIM THE LAST TIME WE MET WAS IN BATH STREET AND I TURNED DIRECTLY INTO A SHOP THAT HE MIGHT NOT SPEAK TO ME
246-224-0011 I WOULD NOT EVEN LOOK AT HIM HE WENT INTO THE PUMP ROOM AFTERWARDS BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE FOLLOWED HIM FOR ALL THE WORLD SUCH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HIM AND YOUR BROTHER PRAY SEND ME SOME NEWS OF THE LATTER I AM QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT HIM
246-224-0012 HE SEEMED SO UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN HE WENT AWAY WITH A COLD OR SOMETHING THAT AFFECTED HIS SPIRITS I WOULD WRITE TO HIM MYSELF BUT HAVE MISLAID HIS DIRECTION AND AS I HINTED ABOVE AM AFRAID HE TOOK SOMETHING IN MY CONDUCT AMISS
246-224-0013 PRAY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO HIS SATISFACTION OR IF HE STILL HARBOURS ANY DOUBT A LINE FROM HIMSELF TO ME OR A CALL AT PUTNEY WHEN NEXT IN TOWN MIGHT SET ALL TO RIGHTS I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE ROOMS THIS AGE
246-224-0014 NOR TO THE PLAY EXCEPT GOING IN LAST NIGHT WITH THE HODGES FOR A FROLIC AT HALF PRICE THEY TEASED ME INTO IT AND I WAS DETERMINED THEY SHOULD NOT SAY I SHUT MYSELF UP BECAUSE TILNEY WAS GONE WE HAPPENED TO SIT BY THE MITCHELLS
246-224-0015 AND THEY PRETENDED TO BE QUITE SURPRISED TO SEE ME OUT I KNEW THEIR SPITE AT ONE TIME THEY COULD NOT BE CIVIL TO ME BUT NOW THEY ARE ALL FRIENDSHIP BUT I AM NOT SUCH A FOOL AS TO BE TAKEN IN BY THEM
246-224-0016 YOU KNOW I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SPIRIT OF MY OWN ANNE MITCHELL HAD TRIED TO PUT ON A TURBAN LIKE MINE AS I WORE IT THE WEEK BEFORE AT THE CONCERT BUT MADE WRETCHED WORK OF IT IT HAPPENED TO BECOME MY ODD FACE I BELIEVE
246-224-0017 AT LEAST TILNEY TOLD ME SO AT THE TIME AND SAID EVERY EYE WAS UPON ME BUT HE IS THE LAST MAN WHOSE WORD I WOULD TAKE I WEAR NOTHING BUT PURPLE NOW I KNOW I LOOK HIDEOUS IN IT BUT NO MATTER
246-224-0018 LOSE NO TIME MY DEAREST SWEETEST CATHERINE IN WRITING TO HIM AND TO ME WHO EVER AM ET CETERA SUCH A STRAIN OF SHALLOW ARTIFICE COULD NOT IMPOSE EVEN UPON CATHERINE
246-224-0019 ITS INCONSISTENCIES CONTRADICTIONS AND FALSEHOOD STRUCK HER FROM THE VERY FIRST SHE WAS ASHAMED OF ISABELLA AND ASHAMED OF HAVING EVER LOVED HER HER PROFESSIONS OF ATTACHMENT WERE NOW AS DISGUSTING AS HER EXCUSES WERE EMPTY
246-224-0020 AND HER DEMANDS IMPUDENT WRITE TO JAMES ON HER BEHALF NO JAMES SHOULD NEVER HEAR ISABELLA'S NAME MENTIONED BY HER AGAIN ON HENRY'S ARRIVAL FROM WOODSTON
246-224-0021 SHE MADE KNOWN TO HIM AND ELEANOR THEIR BROTHER'S SAFETY CONGRATULATING THEM WITH SINCERITY ON IT AND READING ALOUD THE MOST MATERIAL PASSAGES OF HER LETTER WITH STRONG INDIGNATION WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED IT SO MUCH FOR ISABELLA
246-224-0022 SHE CRIED AND FOR ALL OUR INTIMACY SHE MUST THINK ME AN IDIOT OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN SO BUT PERHAPS THIS HAS SERVED TO MAKE HER CHARACTER BETTER KNOWN TO ME THAN MINE IS TO HER I SEE WHAT SHE HAS BEEN ABOUT SHE IS A VAIN COQUETTE
246-224-0023 AND HER TRICKS HAVE NOT ANSWERED I DO NOT BELIEVE SHE HAD EVER ANY REGARD EITHER FOR JAMES OR FOR ME AND I WISH I HAD NEVER KNOWN HER IT WILL SOON BE AS IF YOU NEVER HAD SAID HENRY
246-224-0024 THERE IS BUT ONE THING THAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND I SEE THAT SHE HAS HAD DESIGNS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY WHICH HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAS BEEN ABOUT ALL THIS TIME
246-224-0025 WHY SHOULD HE PAY HER SUCH ATTENTIONS AS TO MAKE HER QUARREL WITH MY BROTHER AND THEN FLY OFF HIMSELF I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY FOR FREDERICK'S MOTIVES SUCH AS I BELIEVE THEM TO HAVE BEEN HE HAS HIS VANITIES AS WELL AS MISS THORPE
246-224-0026 AND THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE IS THAT HAVING A STRONGER HEAD THEY HAVE NOT YET INJURED HIMSELF IF THE EFFECT OF HIS BEHAVIOUR DOES NOT JUSTIFY HIM WITH YOU WE HAD BETTER NOT SEEK AFTER THE CAUSE THEN YOU DO NOT SUPPOSE HE EVER REALLY CARED ABOUT HER
246-224-0027 I AM PERSUADED THAT HE NEVER DID AND ONLY MADE BELIEVE TO DO SO FOR MISCHIEF'S SAKE HENRY BOWED HIS ASSENT WELL THEN I MUST SAY THAT I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL
246-224-0028 THOUGH IT HAS TURNED OUT SO WELL FOR US I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL AS IT HAPPENS THERE IS NO GREAT HARM DONE BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK ISABELLA HAS ANY HEART TO LOSE BUT SUPPOSE HE HAD MADE HER VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM
246-224-0029 BUT WE MUST FIRST SUPPOSE ISABELLA TO HAVE HAD A HEART TO LOSE CONSEQUENTLY TO HAVE BEEN A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE AND IN THAT CASE SHE WOULD HAVE MET WITH VERY DIFFERENT TREATMENT IT IS VERY RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD STAND BY YOUR BROTHER
246-224-0030 BUT YOUR MIND IS WARPED BY AN INNATE PRINCIPLE OF GENERAL INTEGRITY AND THEREFORE NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE COOL REASONINGS OF FAMILY PARTIALITY OR A DESIRE OF REVENGE CATHERINE WAS COMPLIMENTED OUT OF FURTHER BITTERNESS
246-224-0031 FREDERICK COULD NOT BE UNPARDONABLY GUILTY WHILE HENRY MADE HIMSELF SO AGREEABLE
