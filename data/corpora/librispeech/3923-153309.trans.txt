3923-153309-0000 A FEW DAYS LATER THREE MEN WERE CLOSETED IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TWO OF THEM WERE OFFICIALS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HIMSELF AND OUR OLD FRIEND THE INSPECTOR THE THIRD WAS THE DETECTIVE SWEETWATER CHOSEN BY THEM TO KEEP WATCH ON MISTER GREY SWEETWATER HAD JUST COME TO TOWN
3923-153309-0001 THIS WAS EVIDENT FROM THE GRIPSACK HE HAD SET DOWN IN A CORNER ON ENTERING ALSO FROM A CERTAIN TOUSLED APPEARANCE WHICH BESPOKE HASTY RISING AND BUT FEW FACILITIES FOR PROPER ATTENTION TO HIS PERSON THESE DETAILS COUNTED LITTLE HOWEVER IN THE ASTONISHMENT CREATED BY HIS MANNER
3923-153309-0002 AND IF HE HAD HAD ANOTHER FAIRBROTHER HOUSE EXPERIENCE HE REPLIED WITH A DECIDED NO THAT IT WAS NOT HIS ADVENTURE WHICH HAD UPSET HIM BUT THE NEWS HE HAD TO BRING
3923-153309-0003 HERE HE GLANCED AT EVERY DOOR AND WINDOW AND THEN LEANING FORWARD OVER THE TABLE AT WHICH THE TWO OFFICIALS SAT HE BROUGHT HIS HEAD AS NEARLY TO THEM AS POSSIBLE AND WHISPERED FIVE WORDS THEY PRODUCED A MOST UNHAPPY SENSATION BOTH THE MEN
3923-153309-0004 HARDENED AS THEY WERE BY DUTIES WHICH SOON SAP THE SENSIBILITIES STARTED AND TURNED AS PALE AS THE SPEAKER HIMSELF THEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH ONE GLANCE AT THE INSPECTOR ROSE AND LOCKED THE DOOR
3923-153309-0005 THIS DONE HE SO IMPROVED HIS OPPORTUNITY THAT THE TWO WERE SOON ON THE BEST OF TERMS AND HE LEARNED THAT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS WITHOUT A VALET AND BEING UNACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT WITHOUT ONE FELT THE AWKWARDNESS OF HIS POSITION VERY MUCH THIS GAVE SWEETWATER HIS CUE
3923-153309-0006 AND FOR THE HANDLING OF AFFAIRS QUITE APART FROM PERSONAL TENDANCE UPON THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HE SHOWED SUCH AN HONEST DESIRE TO FILL THE PLACE AND MADE OUT TO GIVE SUCH A GOOD ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF ENGAGED FOR THE WORK BEFORE REACHING C
3923-153309-0007 THIS WAS A GREAT STROKE OF LUCK HE THOUGHT BUT HE LITTLE KNEW HOW BIG A STROKE OR INTO WHAT A SERIES OF ADVENTURES IT WAS GOING TO LEAD HIM ONCE ON THE PLATFORM OF THE SMALL STATION AT WHICH MISTER GREY HAD BIDDEN HIM TO STOP HE NOTICED TWO THINGS
3923-153309-0008 THE UTTER HELPLESSNESS OF THE MAN IN ALL PRACTICAL MATTERS AND HIS EXTREME ANXIETY TO SEE ALL THAT WAS GOING ON ABOUT HIM WITHOUT BEING HIMSELF SEEN THERE WAS METHOD IN THIS CURIOSITY TOO MUCH METHOD WOMEN DID NOT INTEREST HIM IN THE LEAST
3923-153309-0009 THEY COULD PASS AND REPASS WITHOUT AROUSING HIS ATTENTION BUT THE MOMENT A MAN STEPPED HIS WAY HE SHRANK FROM HIM ONLY TO BETRAY THE GREATEST CURIOSITY CONCERNING HIM THE MOMENT HE FELT IT SAFE TO TURN AND OBSERVE HIM
3923-153309-0010 ALL OF WHICH CONVINCED SWEETWATER THAT THE ENGLISHMAN'S ERRAND WAS IN CONNECTION WITH A MAN WHOM HE EQUALLY DREADED AND DESIRED TO MEET OF THIS HE WAS MADE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN A LITTLE LATER AS THEY WERE LEAVING THE DEPOT WITH THE REST OF THE ARRIVALS MISTER GREY SAID
3923-153309-0011 I WANT YOU TO GET ME A ROOM AT A VERY QUIET HOTEL THIS DONE YOU ARE TO HUNT UP THE MAN WHOSE NAME YOU WILL FIND WRITTEN IN THIS PAPER
3923-153309-0012 WITHOUT HIS GETTING ANY SORT OF A LOOK AT ME DO THIS AND YOU WILL EARN A WEEK'S SALARY IN ONE DAY SWEETWATER WITH HIS HEAD IN AIR AND HIS HEART ON FIRE FOR MATTERS WERE LOOKING VERY PROMISING INDEED TOOK THE PAPER AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET
3923-153309-0013 THEN HE BEGAN TO HUNT FOR A HOTEL NOT TILL HE HAD FOUND WHAT HE WISHED AND INSTALLED THE ENGLISHMAN IN HIS ROOM DID HE VENTURE TO OPEN THE PRECIOUS MEMORANDUM AND READ THE NAME HE HAD BEEN SPECULATING OVER FOR AN HOUR IT WAS NOT THE ONE HE HAD ANTICIPATED BUT IT CAME NEAR TO IT
3923-153309-0014 IT WAS THAT OF JAMES WELLGOOD SATISFIED NOW THAT HE HAD A TICKLISH MATTER TO HANDLE HE PREPARED FOR IT WITH HIS USUAL ENTHUSIASM AND CIRCUMSPECTION
3923-153309-0015 HIS CALCULATION WAS A CORRECT ONE THE STORE WAS CROWDED WITH PEOPLE TAKING HIS PLACE IN THE LINE DRAWN UP BEFORE THE POST OFFICE WINDOW HE AWAITED HIS TURN
3923-153309-0016 A STRANGER THAT YOUNG MAN PUT IN VOLUBLY LOOKING FOR JAMES WELLGOOD
3923-153309-0017 I SEE THAT HIS LETTERS PASS THROUGH THIS OFFICE YOU'RE TAKING UP ANOTHER MAN'S TIME COMPLAINED THE POSTMASTER
3923-153309-0018 ASK DICK OVER THERE HE KNOWS HIM THE DETECTIVE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO ESCAPE AND ASK DICK BUT HE WAS BETTER PLEASED YET WHEN DICK A FELLOW WITH A SQUINT WHOSE HAND WAS ALWAYS IN THE SUGAR TOLD HIM THAT MISTER WELLGOOD WOULD PROBABLY BE IN FOR HIS MAIL IN A FEW MOMENTS
3923-153309-0019 THAT IS HIS BUGGY STANDING BEFORE THE DRUG STORE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY SO HE HAD NETTED JONES QUONDAM WAITER AT THE FIRST CAST LUCKY WAS WHAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF STILL LUCKY SAUNTERING TO THE DOOR HE WATCHED FOR THE OWNER OF THAT BUGGY
3923-153309-0020 HE HAD LEARNED AS SUCH FELLOWS DO
3923-153309-0021 THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED BY SOME TO BE SEARS HIMSELF IN THIS WAY HE WOULD SOON BE LOOKING UPON THE VERY MAN WHOSE STEPS HE HAD FOLLOWED THROUGH THE FAIRBROTHER HOUSE A FEW NIGHTS BEFORE AND THROUGH WHOSE RESOLUTE ACTION HE HAD VERY NEARLY RUN THE RISK OF A LINGERING DEATH FROM STARVATION
3923-153309-0022 A DANGEROUS CUSTOMER THOUGHT HE
3923-153309-0023 IT APPEARED TO SERVE HIM NOW FOR WHEN THE MAN FINALLY SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE CROSS WALK SEPARATING THE TWO BUILDINGS HE EXPERIENCED A SUDDEN INDECISION NOT UNLIKE THAT OF DREAD AND THERE BEING NOTHING IN THE MAN'S APPEARANCE TO WARRANT APPREHENSION
3923-153309-0024 HE TOOK IT FOR THE INSTINCTIVE RECOGNITION IT UNDOUBTEDLY WAS HE THEREFORE WATCHED HIM NARROWLY AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ONE GLANCE FROM HIS EYE IT WAS ENOUGH THE MAN WAS COMMONPLACE COMMONPLACE IN FEATURE DRESS AND MANNER BUT HIS EYE GAVE HIM AWAY
3923-153309-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING COMMONPLACE IN THAT IT WAS AN EYE TO BEWARE OF HE HAD TAKEN IN SWEETWATER AS HE PASSED BUT SWEETWATER WAS OF A COMMONPLACE TYPE TOO AND WOKE NO CORRESPONDING DREAD IN THE OTHER'S MIND
3923-153309-0026 FOR HE WENT WHISTLING INTO THE STORE FROM WHICH HE PRESENTLY REISSUED WITH A BUNDLE OF MAIL IN HIS HAND THE DETECTIVE'S FIRST INSTINCT WAS TO TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY AS A SUSPECT MUCH WANTED BY THE NEW YORK POLICE BUT REASON ASSURED HIM THAT HE NOT ONLY HAD NO WARRANT FOR THIS
3923-153309-0027 BUT HOW WITH THE CONDITIONS LAID ON HIM BY MISTER GREY WAS THIS TO BE DONE
3923-153309-0028 HOW THEN GO TO WORK TO SECURE HIS COOPERATION IN A SCHEME POSSIBLY AS MYSTERIOUS TO HIM AS IT WAS TO HIMSELF HE COULD STOP THIS STRANGER IN MID STREET WITH SOME PLAUSIBLE EXCUSE BUT IT DID NOT FOLLOW THAT HE WOULD SUCCEED IN LURING HIM TO THE HOTEL WHERE MISTER GREY COULD SEE HIM
3923-153309-0029 WELLGOOD OR AS HE BELIEVED SEARS KNEW TOO MUCH OF LIFE TO BE BEGUILED BY ANY OPEN CLAP TRAP AND SWEETWATER WAS OBLIGED TO SEE HIM DRIVE OFF WITHOUT HAVING MADE THE LEAST ADVANCE IN THE PURPOSE ENGROSSING HIM BUT THAT WAS NOTHING HE HAD ALL THE EVENING BEFORE HIM
3923-153309-0030 AND REENTERING THE STORE HE TOOK UP HIS STAND NEAR THE SUGAR BARREL HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT IN THE PAUSES OF WEIGHING AND TASTING DICK TALKED IF HE WERE GUIDED WITH SUITABLE DISCRETION WHY SHOULD HE NOT TALK OF WELLGOOD HE WAS GUIDED AND HE DID TALK AND TO SOME EFFECT
3923-153309-0031 THAT IS HE GAVE INFORMATION OF THE MAN WHICH SURPRISED SWEETWATER IF IN THE PAST AND IN NEW YORK HE HAD BEEN KNOWN AS A WAITER OR SHOULD I SAY STEWARD HE WAS KNOWN HERE AS A MANUFACTURER OF PATENT MEDICINE DESIGNED TO REJUVENATE THE HUMAN RACE
3923-153309-0032 HE HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN TOWN AND WAS SOMEWHAT OF A STRANGER YET BUT HE WOULDN'T BE SO LONG HE WAS GOING TO MAKE THINGS HUM HE WAS MONEY FOR THIS MONEY FOR THAT A HORSE WHERE ANOTHER MAN WOULD WALK AND MAIL WELL THAT ALONE WOULD MAKE THIS POST OFFICE WORTH WHILE
3923-153309-0033 THEN THE DRUGS ORDERED BY WHOLESALE THOSE BOXES OVER THERE WERE HIS READY TO BE CARTED OUT TO HIS MANUFACTORY COUNT THEM SOME ONE AND THINK OF THE BOTTLES AND BOTTLES OF STUFF THEY STAND FOR IF IT SELLS AS HE SAYS IT WILL THEN HE WILL SOON BE RICH AND SO ON
3923-153309-0034 TILL SWEETWATER BROUGHT THE GARRULOUS DICK TO A STANDSTILL BY ASKING WHETHER WELLGOOD HAD BEEN AWAY FOR ANY PURPOSE SINCE HE FIRST CAME TO TOWN HE RECEIVED THE REPLY THAT HE HAD JUST COME HOME FROM NEW YORK WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR SOME ARTICLES NEEDED IN HIS MANUFACTORY SWEETWATER FELT ALL HIS CONVICTIONS CONFIRMED
3923-153309-0035 AND ENDED THE COLLOQUY WITH THE FINAL QUESTION AND WHERE IS HIS MANUFACTORY MIGHT BE WORTH VISITING PERHAPS THE OTHER MADE A GESTURE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT NORTHWEST AND RUSHED TO HELP A CUSTOMER SWEETWATER TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO SLIDE AWAY
3923-153309-0036 THAT THE MAN WHO ANSWERED TO THE NAME OF WELLGOOD
3923-153309-0037 AND ARMED WITH DEFINITE INFORMATION HE APPEARED BEFORE MISTER GREY WHO TO HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS DINING IN HIS OWN ROOM HE HAD DISMISSED THE WAITER AND WAS RATHER BROODING THAN EATING HE LOOKED UP EAGERLY HOWEVER WHEN SWEETWATER ENTERED AND ASKED WHAT NEWS
3923-153309-0038 THE DETECTIVE WITH SOME SEMBLANCE OF RESPECT ANSWERED THAT HE HAD SEEN WELLGOOD BUT THAT HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DETAIN HIM OR BRING HIM WITHIN HIS EMPLOYER'S OBSERVATION HE IS A PATENT MEDICINE MAN HE THEN EXPLAINED
3923-153309-0039 AND MANUFACTURES HIS OWN CONCOCTIONS IN A HOUSE HE HAS RENTED HERE ON A LONELY ROAD SOME HALF MILE OUT OF TOWN WELLGOOD DOES THE MAN NAMED WELLGOOD MISTER GREY EXCLAIMED WITH ALL THE ASTONISHMENT THE OTHER SECRETLY EXPECTED YES WELLGOOD JAMES WELLGOOD THERE IS NO OTHER IN TOWN
3923-153309-0040 AH MISTER GREY ROSE PRECIPITATELY HIS MANNER HAD CHANGED I MUST SEE HIM WHAT YOU TELL ME MAKES IT ALL THE MORE NECESSARY FOR ME TO SEE HIM HOW CAN YOU BRING IT ABOUT WITHOUT HIS SEEING YOU SWEETWATER ASKED YES YES CERTAINLY WITHOUT HIS SEEING ME
