5333-5097-0000 AS FAST AS FAST MIGHT BE
5333-5097-0001 DOST FEAR TO RIDE WITH ME BURGER THERE IS ONE ADVANTAGE IN AN ACCUMULATION OF EVILS DIFFERING IN CAUSE AND CHARACTER THAT THE DISTRACTION WHICH THEY AFFORD BY THEIR CONTRADICTORY OPERATION PREVENTS THE PATIENT
5333-5097-0002 AND I WAS DISTRESSED BY THE NEWS OF MISTER TRESHAM YET LESS SO THAN IF THEY HAD FULLY OCCUPIED MY MIND I WAS NEITHER A FALSE LOVER NOR AN UNFEELING SON
5333-5097-0003 SUCH WERE MY REFLECTIONS WHEN I GAINED MY APARTMENT IT SEEMS FROM THE ILLUSTRATION THEY ALREADY BEGAN TO HAVE A TWANG OF COMMERCE IN THEM I SET MYSELF SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER YOUR FATHER'S LETTER IT WAS NOT VERY DISTINCT
5333-5097-0004 AND REFERRED FOR SEVERAL PARTICULARS TO OWEN WHOM I WAS ENTREATED TO MEET WITH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AT A SCOTCH TOWN CALLED GLASGOW BEING INFORMED MOREOVER THAT MY OLD FRIEND WAS TO BE HEARD OF AT MESSRS MAC VITTIE MAC FIN AND COMPANY
5333-5097-0005 IT LIKEWISE ALLUDED TO SEVERAL LETTERS WHICH AS IT APPEARED TO ME MUST HAVE MISCARRIED OR HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED AND COMPLAINED OF MY OBDURATE SILENCE IN TERMS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHLY UNJUST HAD MY LETTERS REACHED THEIR PURPOSED DESTINATION
5333-5097-0006 I WAS AMAZED AS I READ THAT THE SPIRIT OF RASHLEIGH WALKED AROUND ME AND CONJURED UP THESE DOUBTS AND DIFFICULTIES BY WHICH I WAS SURROUNDED I COULD NOT DOUBT FOR ONE INSTANT
5333-5097-0007 HOWEVER DISTRESSING IT MIGHT IN OTHER RESPECTS AND AT ANOTHER TIME HAVE APPEARED TO ME SUNK INTO A SUBORDINATE CONSIDERATION WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE DANGERS IMPENDING OVER MY FATHER I DID NOT MYSELF SET A HIGH ESTIMATION ON WEALTH
5333-5097-0008 AND HAD THE AFFECTATION OF MOST YOUNG MEN OF LIVELY IMAGINATION
5333-5097-0009 AND THE RESULT OF MY DELIBERATION WAS A FIRM RESOLUTION TO DEPART FROM OSBALDISTONE HALL THE NEXT DAY AND WEND MY WAY WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO MEET OWEN AT GLASGOW I DID NOT HOLD IT EXPEDIENT TO INTIMATE MY DEPARTURE TO MY UNCLE
5333-5097-0010 IN THE EXTENT AND DECIDED CHARACTER OF RASHLEIGH'S MACHINATIONS THAT I HAD SOME APPREHENSION OF HIS HAVING PROVIDED MEANS TO INTERCEPT A JOURNEY WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN WITH A VIEW TO DISCONCERT THEM IF MY DEPARTURE WERE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED AT OSBALDISTONE HALL
5333-5097-0011 WAS LIKELY TO PREVENT THAT SPEED WHICH WAS THE SOUL OF MY EXPEDITION I DID NOT KNOW THE SHORTEST NOR INDEED ANY ROAD TO GLASGOW AND AS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I STOOD DESPATCH WAS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE
5333-5097-0012 I DETERMINED TO CONSULT ANDREW FAIRSERVICE ON THE SUBJECT AS THE NEAREST AND MOST AUTHENTIC AUTHORITY WITHIN MY REACH LATE AS IT WAS I SET OFF WITH THE INTENTION OF ASCERTAINING THIS IMPORTANT POINT AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES WALK REACHED THE DWELLING OF THE GARDENER
5333-5097-0013 ANDREW'S DWELLING WAS SITUATED AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE EXTERIOR WALL OF THE GARDEN A SNUG COMFORTABLE NORTHUMBRIAN COTTAGE BUILT OF STONES ROUGHLY DRESSED WITH THE HAMMER AND HAVING THE WINDOWS AND DOORS DECORATED WITH HUGE HEAVY ARCHITRAVES
5333-5097-0014 AND A KITCHEN GARDEN BEHIND A PADDOCK FOR A COW AND A SMALL FIELD CULTIVATED WITH SEVERAL CROPS OF GRAIN RATHER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COTTAGER THAN FOR SALE ANNOUNCED THE WARM AND CORDIAL COMFORTS WHICH OLD ENGLAND
5333-5097-0015 LED ME TO THINK THAT ANDREW ACCORDING TO THE DECENT AND MERITORIOUS CUSTOM OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HAD ASSEMBLED SOME OF HIS NEIGHBOURS TO JOIN IN FAMILY EXERCISE AS HE CALLED EVENING DEVOTION
5333-5097-0016 ANDREW HAD INDEED NEITHER WIFE CHILD NOR FEMALE INMATE IN HIS FAMILY THE FIRST OF HIS TRADE HE SAID HAD HAD ENEUGH O'THAE CATTLE BUT NOTWITHSTANDING HE SOMETIMES CONTRIVED TO FORM AN AUDIENCE FOR HIMSELF
5333-5097-0017 OUT OF THE NEIGHBOURING PAPISTS AND CHURCH OF ENGLANDMEN BRANDS AS HE EXPRESSED IT SNATCHED OUT OF THE BURNING ON WHOM HE USED TO EXERCISE HIS SPIRITUAL GIFTS
5333-5097-0018 AND ALL THE WORLD OF CATHOLICS AROUND HIM WHO DEEMED HIS INTERFERENCE ON SUCH OCCASIONS AN ACT OF HERETICAL INTERLOPING I CONCEIVED IT LIKELY THEREFORE THAT THE WELL DISPOSED NEIGHBOURS MIGHT HAVE ASSEMBLED TO HOLD SOME CHAPEL OF EASE OF THIS NATURE
5333-5097-0019 THE NOISE HOWEVER WHEN I LISTENED TO IT MORE ACCURATELY SEEMED TO PROCEED ENTIRELY FROM THE LUNGS OF THE SAID ANDREW AND WHEN I INTERRUPTED IT BY ENTERING THE HOUSE I FOUND FAIRSERVICE ALONE
5333-5097-0020 WITH LONG WORDS AND HARD NAMES AND READING ALOUD FOR THE PURPOSE OF HIS OWN EDIFICATION A VOLUME OF CONTROVERSIAL DIVINITY I WAS JUST TAKING A SPELL SAID HE LAYING ASIDE THE HUGE FOLIO VOLUME AS I ENTERED
