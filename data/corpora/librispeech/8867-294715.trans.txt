8867-294715-0000 HAVING ANSWERED MY INQUIRIES THE WOMAN PUT HER OWN SORDID CONSTRUCTION ON MY MOTIVE FOR VISITING THE PRISONER HAS THE MONEY YOU LEFT UPSTAIRS GONE INTO HIS GREEDY POCKETS ALREADY SHE ASKED IF I WAS AS RICH AS YOU ARE
8867-294715-0001 I SHOULD LET IT GO IN YOUR PLACE I WOULDN'T TOUCH HIM WITH A PAIR OF TONGS THE WOMAN'S COARSE WARNING ACTUALLY PROVED USEFUL TO ME IT STARTED A NEW IDEA IN MY MIND BEFORE SHE SPOKE
8867-294715-0002 I HAD BEEN TOO DULL OR TOO PREOCCUPIED TO SEE THAT IT WAS QUITE NEEDLESS TO DEGRADE MYSELF BY PERSONALLY COMMUNICATING WITH VAN BRANDT IN HIS PRISON IT ONLY NOW OCCURRED TO ME THAT MY LEGAL ADVISERS WERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
8867-294715-0003 WITH THIS ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE THAT THEY COULD KEEP MY SHARE IN THE TRANSACTION A SECRET EVEN FROM VAN BRANDT HIMSELF I DROVE AT ONCE TO THE OFFICE OF MY LAWYERS THE SENIOR PARTNER
