985-126228-0000 BY CATCHING SIGHT OF THE SIGNATURE WHICH WAS IN HER FULL NAME NEVER USED IN HER CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIM SINCE HER FIRST NOTE MY DEAR JUDE I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU WHICH PERHAPS YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THOUGH CERTAINLY IT MAY STRIKE YOU AS BEING ACCELERATED
985-126228-0001 AS THE RAILWAY COMPANIES SAY OF THEIR TRAINS MISTER PHILLOTSON AND I ARE TO BE MARRIED QUITE SOON IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS WE HAD INTENDED AS YOU KNOW TO WAIT TILL I HAD GONE THROUGH MY COURSE OF TRAINING AND OBTAINED MY CERTIFICATE SO AS TO ASSIST HIM IF NECESSARY IN THE TEACHING
985-126228-0002 BUT HE GENEROUSLY SAYS HE DOES NOT SEE ANY OBJECT IN WAITING
985-126228-0003 IT IS SO GOOD OF HIM BECAUSE THE AWKWARDNESS OF MY SITUATION HAS REALLY COME ABOUT BY MY FAULT IN GETTING EXPELLED WISH ME JOY REMEMBER I SAY YOU ARE TO AND YOU MUSTN'T REFUSE YOUR AFFECTIONATE COUSIN
985-126228-0004 SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD JUDE STAGGERED UNDER THE NEWS COULD EAT NO BREAKFAST AND KEPT ON DRINKING TEA BECAUSE HIS MOUTH WAS SO DRY
985-126228-0005 THEN PRESENTLY HE WENT BACK TO HIS WORK AND LAUGHED THE USUAL BITTER LAUGH OF A MAN SO CONFRONTED EVERYTHING SEEMED TURNING TO SATIRE AND YET WHAT COULD THE POOR GIRL DO HE ASKED HIMSELF AND FELT WORSE THAN SHEDDING TEARS
985-126228-0006 O SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY HE SAID AS HE WORKED YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MARRIAGE MEANS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT HIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS OWN MARRIAGE HAD PRICKED HER ON TO THIS
985-126228-0007 BUT SUE WAS NOT A VERY PRACTICAL OR CALCULATING PERSON AND HE WAS COMPELLED TO THINK THAT A PIQUE AT HAVING HIS SECRET SPRUNG UPON HER HAD MOVED HER TO GIVE WAY TO PHILLOTSON'S PROBABLE REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE BEST COURSE TO PROVE HOW UNFOUNDED WERE THE SUSPICIONS OF THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES WOULD BE TO MARRY HIM OFF HAND
985-126228-0008 AS IN FULFILMENT OF AN ORDINARY ENGAGEMENT SUE HAD IN FACT BEEN PLACED IN AN AWKWARD CORNER POOR SUE HE DETERMINED TO PLAY THE SPARTAN TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT AND SUPPORT HER BUT HE COULD NOT WRITE THE REQUESTED GOOD WISHES FOR A DAY OR TWO
985-126228-0009 MEANWHILE THERE CAME ANOTHER NOTE FROM HIS IMPATIENT LITTLE DEAR JUDE WILL YOU GIVE ME AWAY I HAVE NOBODY ELSE WHO COULD DO IT SO CONVENIENTLY AS YOU BEING THE ONLY MARRIED RELATION I HAVE HERE ON THE SPOT EVEN IF MY FATHER WERE FRIENDLY ENOUGH TO BE WILLING WHICH HE ISN'T
985-126228-0010 ACCORDING TO THE CEREMONY AS THERE PRINTED MY BRIDEGROOM CHOOSES ME OF HIS OWN WILL AND PLEASURE BUT I DON'T CHOOSE HIM SOMEBODY GIVES ME TO HIM LIKE A SHE ASS OR SHE GOAT OR ANY OTHER DOMESTIC ANIMAL BLESS YOUR EXALTED VIEWS OF WOMAN O CHURCHMAN
985-126228-0011 BUT I FORGET I AM NO LONGER PRIVILEGED TO TEASE YOU EVER SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD JUDE SCREWED HIMSELF UP TO HEROIC KEY AND REPLIED MY DEAR SUE OF COURSE I WISH YOU JOY
985-126228-0012 AND ALSO OF COURSE I WILL GIVE YOU AWAY WHAT I SUGGEST IS THAT AS YOU HAVE NO HOUSE OF YOUR OWN YOU DO NOT MARRY FROM YOUR SCHOOL FRIEND'S BUT FROM MINE
985-126228-0013 I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SIGN YOUR LETTER IN SUCH A NEW AND TERRIBLY FORMAL WAY SURELY YOU CARE A BIT ABOUT ME STILL EVER YOUR AFFECTIONATE JUDE WHAT HAD JARRED ON HIM EVEN MORE THAN THE SIGNATURE WAS A LITTLE STING HE HAD BEEN SILENT ON
985-126228-0014 THE PHRASE MARRIED RELATION WHAT AN IDIOT IT MADE HIM SEEM AS HER LOVER IF SUE HAD WRITTEN THAT IN SATIRE HE COULD HARDLY FORGIVE HER IF IN SUFFERING AH THAT WAS ANOTHER THING HIS OFFER OF HIS LODGING MUST HAVE COMMENDED ITSELF TO PHILLOTSON AT ANY RATE
985-126228-0015 FOR THE SCHOOLMASTER SENT HIM A LINE OF WARM THANKS ACCEPTING THE CONVENIENCE SUE ALSO THANKED HIM JUDE IMMEDIATELY MOVED INTO MORE COMMODIOUS QUARTERS AS MUCH TO ESCAPE THE ESPIONAGE OF THE SUSPICIOUS LANDLADY WHO HAD BEEN ONE CAUSE OF SUE'S UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE
985-126228-0016 AS FOR THE SAKE OF ROOM THEN SUE WROTE TO TELL HIM THE DAY FIXED FOR THE WEDDING AND JUDE DECIDED AFTER INQUIRY THAT SHE SHOULD COME INTO RESIDENCE ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY WHICH WOULD ALLOW OF A TEN DAYS STAY IN THE CITY PRIOR TO THE CEREMONY
985-126228-0017 SUFFICIENTLY REPRESENTING A NOMINAL RESIDENCE OF FIFTEEN SHE ARRIVED BY THE TEN O'CLOCK TRAIN ON THE DAY AFORESAID JUDE NOT GOING TO MEET HER AT THE STATION BY HER SPECIAL REQUEST THAT HE SHOULD NOT LOSE A MORNING'S WORK AND PAY SHE SAID IF THIS WERE HER TRUE REASON
985-126228-0018 BUT SO WELL BY THIS TIME DID HE KNOW SUE THAT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR MUTUAL SENSITIVENESS AT EMOTIONAL CRISES MIGHT HE THOUGHT HAVE WEIGHED WITH HER IN THIS WHEN HE CAME HOME TO DINNER SHE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER APARTMENT
985-126228-0019 SHE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM BUT ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR AND THEY SAW EACH OTHER LITTLE AN OCCASIONAL SUPPER BEING THE ONLY MEAL THEY TOOK TOGETHER WHEN SUE'S MANNER WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF A SCARED CHILD WHAT SHE FELT HE DID NOT KNOW THEIR CONVERSATION WAS MECHANICAL
985-126228-0020 THOUGH SHE DID NOT LOOK PALE OR ILL PHILLOTSON CAME FREQUENTLY BUT MOSTLY WHEN JUDE WAS ABSENT ON THE MORNING OF THE WEDDING WHEN JUDE HAD GIVEN HIMSELF A HOLIDAY SUE AND HER COUSIN HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME DURING THIS CURIOUS INTERVAL
985-126228-0021 IN HIS ROOM THE PARLOUR WHICH HE HAD HIRED FOR THE PERIOD OF SUE'S RESIDENCE SEEING AS WOMEN DO HOW HELPLESS HE WAS IN MAKING THE PLACE COMFORTABLE SHE BUSTLED ABOUT WHAT'S THE MATTER JUDE SHE SAID SUDDENLY
985-126228-0022 HE WAS LEANING WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND HIS CHIN ON HIS HANDS LOOKING INTO A FUTURITY WHICH SEEMED TO BE SKETCHED OUT ON THE TABLECLOTH OH NOTHING YOU ARE FATHER YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THE MAN WHO GIVES YOU AWAY
985-126228-0023 AND HAD TAKEN BREAKFAST APART WHAT OPPRESSED JUDE WAS THE THOUGHT THAT HAVING DONE A WRONG THING OF THIS SORT HIMSELF HE WAS AIDING AND ABETTING THE WOMAN HE LOVED IN DOING A LIKE WRONG THING INSTEAD OF IMPLORING AND WARNING HER AGAINST IT IT WAS ON HIS TONGUE TO SAY
985-126228-0024 AFTER BREAKFAST THEY WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND TOGETHER MOVED BY A MUTUAL THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY THEY WOULD HAVE OF INDULGING IN UNCEREMONIOUS COMPANIONSHIP BY THE IRONY OF FATE
985-126228-0025 SHE TOOK HIS ARM AS THEY WALKED THROUGH THE MUDDY STREET A THING SHE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE IN HER LIFE AND ON TURNING THE CORNER THEY FOUND THEMSELVES CLOSE TO A GREY PERPENDICULAR CHURCH WITH A LOW PITCHED ROOF THE CHURCH OF SAINT THOMAS THAT'S THE CHURCH SAID JUDE
985-126228-0026 WHERE I AM GOING TO BE MARRIED YES INDEED SHE EXCLAIMED WITH CURIOSITY HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO GO IN AND SEE WHAT THE SPOT IS LIKE WHERE I AM SO SOON TO KNEEL AND DO IT AGAIN HE SAID TO HIMSELF
985-126228-0027 SHE DOES NOT REALIZE WHAT MARRIAGE MEANS HE PASSIVELY ACQUIESCED IN HER WISH TO GO IN AND THEY ENTERED BY THE WESTERN DOOR THE ONLY PERSON INSIDE THE GLOOMY BUILDING WAS A CHARWOMAN CLEANING
985-126228-0028 ALMOST AS IF SHE LOVED HIM CRUELLY SWEET INDEED SHE HAD BEEN TO HIM THAT MORNING BUT HIS THOUGHTS OF A PENANCE IN STORE FOR HER WERE TEMPERED BY AN ACHE
985-126228-0029 NOR PROVE TOO MUCH FOR YOUR WOMANHOOD THEY STROLLED UNDEMONSTRATIVELY UP THE NAVE TOWARDS THE ALTAR RAILING WHICH THEY STOOD AGAINST IN SILENCE TURNING THEN AND WALKING DOWN THE NAVE AGAIN HER HAND STILL ON HIS ARM PRECISELY LIKE A COUPLE JUST MARRIED
985-126228-0030 THE TOO SUGGESTIVE INCIDENT ENTIRELY OF HER MAKING NEARLY BROKE DOWN JUDE I LIKE TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS SHE SAID IN THE DELICATE VOICE OF AN EPICURE IN EMOTIONS WHICH LEFT NO DOUBT THAT SHE SPOKE THE TRUTH I KNOW YOU DO
985-126228-0031 SAID JUDE THEY ARE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY HAVE PROBABLY NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE I SHALL WALK DOWN THE CHURCH LIKE THIS WITH MY HUSBAND IN ABOUT TWO HOURS SHAN'T I NO DOUBT YOU WILL WAS IT LIKE THIS WHEN YOU WERE MARRIED
985-126228-0032 GOOD GOD SUE DON'T BE SO AWFULLY MERCILESS THERE DEAR ONE I DIDN'T MEAN IT AH YOU ARE VEXED SHE SAID REGRETFULLY AS SHE BLINKED AWAY AN ACCESS OF EYE MOISTURE AND I PROMISED NEVER TO VEX YOU
985-126228-0033 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ASKED YOU TO BRING ME IN HERE OH I OUGHTN'T I SEE IT NOW MY CURIOSITY TO HUNT UP A NEW SENSATION ALWAYS LEADS ME INTO THESE SCRAPES FORGIVE ME YOU WILL WON'T YOU JUDE
985-126228-0034 THE APPEAL WAS SO REMORSEFUL THAT JUDE'S EYES WERE EVEN WETTER THAN HERS AS HE PRESSED HER HAND FOR YES NOW WE'LL HURRY AWAY AND I WON'T DO IT ANY MORE SHE CONTINUED HUMBLY AND THEY CAME OUT OF THE BUILDING
985-126228-0035 BUT THE FIRST PERSON THEY ENCOUNTERED ON ENTERING THE MAIN STREET WAS THE SCHOOLMASTER HIMSELF WHOSE TRAIN HAD ARRIVED SOONER THAN SUE EXPECTED THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY TO DEMUR TO IN HER LEANING ON JUDE'S ARM BUT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND JUDE THOUGHT THAT PHILLOTSON HAD LOOKED SURPRISED
985-126228-0036 WE HAVE BEEN DOING SUCH A FUNNY THING SAID SHE SMILING CANDIDLY WE'VE BEEN TO THE CHURCH REHEARSING AS IT WERE HAVEN'T WE JUDE HOW SAID PHILLOTSON CURIOUSLY JUDE INWARDLY DEPLORED WHAT HE THOUGHT TO BE UNNECESSARY FRANKNESS
985-126228-0037 BUT SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR NOT TO EXPLAIN ALL WHICH SHE ACCORDINGLY DID TELLING HIM HOW THEY HAD MARCHED UP TO THE ALTAR SEEING HOW PUZZLED PHILLOTSON SEEMED JUDE SAID AS CHEERFULLY AS HE COULD I AM GOING TO BUY HER ANOTHER LITTLE PRESENT
985-126228-0038 JUDE SOON JOINED THEM AT HIS ROOMS AND SHORTLY AFTER THEY PREPARED FOR THE CEREMONY PHILLOTSON'S HAIR WAS BRUSHED TO A PAINFUL EXTENT AND HIS SHIRT COLLAR APPEARED STIFFER THAN IT HAD BEEN FOR THE PREVIOUS TWENTY YEARS BEYOND THIS HE LOOKED DIGNIFIED AND THOUGHTFUL
985-126228-0039 AND ALTOGETHER A MAN OF WHOM IT WAS NOT UNSAFE TO PREDICT THAT HE WOULD MAKE A KIND AND CONSIDERATE HUSBAND THAT HE ADORED SUE WAS OBVIOUS AND SHE COULD ALMOST BE SEEN TO FEEL THAT SHE WAS UNDESERVING HIS ADORATION
985-126228-0040 ALTHOUGH THE DISTANCE WAS SO SHORT HE HAD HIRED A FLY FROM THE RED LION AND SIX OR SEVEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAD GATHERED BY THE DOOR WHEN THEY CAME OUT THE SCHOOLMASTER AND SUE WERE UNKNOWN THOUGH JUDE WAS GETTING TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CITIZEN
985-126228-0041 AND THE COUPLE WERE JUDGED TO BE SOME RELATIONS OF HIS FROM A DISTANCE NOBODY SUPPOSING SUE TO HAVE BEEN A RECENT PUPIL AT THE TRAINING SCHOOL IN THE CARRIAGE JUDE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET HIS EXTRA LITTLE WEDDING PRESENT WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE TWO OR THREE YARDS OF WHITE TULLE
985-126228-0042 IT LOOKS SO ODD OVER A BONNET SHE SAID I'LL TAKE THE BONNET OFF OH NO LET IT STAY SAID PHILLOTSON AND SHE OBEYED WHEN THEY HAD PASSED UP THE CHURCH AND WERE STANDING IN THEIR PLACES
985-126228-0043 JUDE FOUND THAT THE ANTECEDENT VISIT HAD CERTAINLY TAKEN OFF THE EDGE OF THIS PERFORMANCE BUT BY THE TIME THEY WERE HALF WAY ON WITH THE SERVICE HE WISHED FROM HIS HEART THAT HE HAD NOT UNDERTAKEN THE BUSINESS OF GIVING HER AWAY HOW COULD SUE HAVE HAD THE TEMERITY TO ASK HIM TO DO IT
985-126228-0044 A CRUELTY POSSIBLY TO HERSELF AS WELL AS TO HIM WOMEN WERE DIFFERENT FROM MEN IN SUCH MATTERS WAS IT THAT THEY WERE INSTEAD OF MORE SENSITIVE AS REPUTED MORE CALLOUS AND LESS ROMANTIC OR WERE THEY MORE HEROIC
985-126228-0045 OR WAS SUE SIMPLY SO PERVERSE THAT SHE WILFULLY GAVE HERSELF AND HIM PAIN FOR THE ODD AND MOURNFUL LUXURY OF PRACTISING LONG SUFFERING IN HER OWN PERSON AND OF BEING TOUCHED WITH TENDER PITY FOR HIM AT HAVING MADE HIM PRACTISE IT HE COULD PERCEIVE THAT HER FACE WAS NERVOUSLY SET
985-126228-0046 AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE TRYING ORDEAL OF JUDE GIVING HER TO PHILLOTSON SHE COULD HARDLY COMMAND HERSELF RATHER HOWEVER AS IT SEEMED FROM HER KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HER COUSIN MUST FEEL WHOM SHE NEED NOT HAVE HAD THERE AT ALL THAN FROM SELF CONSIDERATION
985-126228-0047 AND GRIEVING FOR THE SUFFERER AGAIN AND AGAIN IN ALL HER COLOSSAL INCONSISTENCY PHILLOTSON SEEMED NOT TO NOTICE TO BE SURROUNDED BY A MIST WHICH PREVENTED HIS SEEING THE EMOTIONS OF OTHERS AS SOON AS THEY HAD SIGNED THEIR NAMES AND COME AWAY
985-126228-0048 AND THE SUSPENSE WAS OVER JUDE FELT RELIEVED THE MEAL AT HIS LODGING WAS A VERY SIMPLE AFFAIR AND AT TWO O'CLOCK THEY WENT OFF IN CROSSING THE PAVEMENT TO THE FLY SHE LOOKED BACK AND THERE WAS A FRIGHTENED LIGHT IN HER EYES COULD IT BE
985-126228-0049 THAT SUE HAD ACTED WITH SUCH UNUSUAL FOOLISHNESS AS TO PLUNGE INTO SHE KNEW NOT WHAT FOR THE SAKE OF ASSERTING HER INDEPENDENCE OF HIM OF RETALIATING ON HIM FOR HIS SECRECY
985-126228-0050 PERHAPS SUE WAS THUS VENTURESOME WITH MEN BECAUSE SHE WAS CHILDISHLY IGNORANT OF THAT SIDE OF THEIR NATURES WHICH WORE OUT WOMEN'S HEARTS AND LIVES
985-126228-0051 JUDE AND THE LANDLADY OFFERED TO GET IT NO SHE SAID RUNNING BACK IT IS MY HANDKERCHIEF I KNOW WHERE I LEFT IT JUDE FOLLOWED HER BACK SHE HAD FOUND IT AND CAME HOLDING IT IN HER HAND SHE LOOKED INTO HIS EYES WITH HER OWN TEARFUL ONES AND HER LIPS SUDDENLY PARTED AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO AVOW SOMETHING
