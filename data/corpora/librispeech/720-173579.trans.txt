720-173579-0000 JUST NOW A BLACK OLD NEUTRAL PERSONAGE OF THE THIRD SEX STEPT UP AND PEERING OVER THE CAPTIVES SEEM'D TO MARK THEIR LOOKS AND AGE AND CAPABILITIES
720-173579-0001 AS TO DISCOVER IF THEY WERE FITTED FOR THE PURPOSED CAGE NO LADY E'ER IS OGLED BY A LOVER HORSE BY A BLACKLEG BROADCLOTH BY A TAILOR
