1154-129976-0000 HER JOY AND EXPRESSION OF REGARD LONG OUTLIVED HER WONDER
1154-129976-0001 HIS AFFECTIONS SEEMED TO REANIMATE TOWARDS THEM ALL AND HIS INTEREST IN THEIR WELFARE AGAIN BECAME PERCEPTIBLE HE WAS NOT IN SPIRITS HOWEVER HE PRAISED THEIR HOUSE ADMIRED ITS PROSPECT WAS ATTENTIVE AND KIND
1154-129976-0002 BUT STILL HE WAS NOT IN SPIRITS THE WHOLE FAMILY PERCEIVED IT AND MISSUS DASHWOOD ATTRIBUTING IT TO SOME WANT OF LIBERALITY IN HIS MOTHER SAT DOWN TO TABLE INDIGNANT AGAINST ALL SELFISH PARENTS
1154-129976-0003 WHAT ARE MISSUS FERRARS'S VIEWS FOR YOU AT PRESENT EDWARD SAID SHE WHEN DINNER WAS OVER AND THEY HAD DRAWN ROUND THE FIRE
1154-129976-0004 NO I HOPE MY MOTHER IS NOW CONVINCED THAT I HAVE NO MORE TALENTS THAN INCLINATION FOR A PUBLIC LIFE BUT HOW IS YOUR FAME TO BE ESTABLISHED FOR FAMOUS YOU MUST BE TO SATISFY ALL YOUR FAMILY AND WITH NO INCLINATION FOR EXPENSE NO AFFECTION FOR STRANGERS
1154-129976-0005 NO PROFESSION AND NO ASSURANCE YOU MAY FIND IT A DIFFICULT MATTER I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT IT I HAVE NO WISH TO BE DISTINGUISHED AND HAVE EVERY REASON TO HOPE I NEVER SHALL THANK HEAVEN I CANNOT BE FORCED INTO GENIUS AND ELOQUENCE
1154-129976-0006 YOU HAVE NO AMBITION I WELL KNOW YOUR WISHES ARE ALL MODERATE AS MODERATE AS THOSE OF THE REST OF THE WORLD I BELIEVE I WISH AS WELL AS EVERY BODY ELSE TO BE PERFECTLY HAPPY
1154-129976-0007 GREATNESS WILL NOT MAKE ME SO STRANGE THAT IT WOULD CRIED MARIANNE WHAT HAVE WEALTH OR GRANDEUR TO DO WITH HAPPINESS
1154-129976-0008 MONEY CAN ONLY GIVE HAPPINESS WHERE THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO GIVE IT BEYOND A COMPETENCE IT CAN AFFORD NO REAL SATISFACTION AS FAR AS MERE SELF IS CONCERNED
1154-129976-0009 YOUR COMPETENCE AND MY WEALTH ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE I DARE SAY AND WITHOUT THEM AS THE WORLD GOES NOW WE SHALL BOTH AGREE THAT EVERY KIND OF EXTERNAL COMFORT MUST BE WANTING
1154-129976-0010 COME WHAT IS YOUR COMPETENCE ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OR TWO THOUSAND A YEAR NOT MORE THAN THAT ELINOR LAUGHED TWO THOUSAND A YEAR ONE IS MY WEALTH I GUESSED HOW IT WOULD END
1154-129976-0011 AND YET TWO THOUSAND A YEAR IS A VERY MODERATE INCOME SAID MARIANNE
1154-129976-0012 I AM SURE I AM NOT EXTRAVAGANT IN MY DEMANDS A PROPER ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS A CARRIAGE PERHAPS TWO AND HUNTERS CANNOT BE SUPPORTED ON LESS
1154-129976-0013 HUNTERS REPEATED EDWARD BUT WHY MUST YOU HAVE HUNTERS EVERY BODY DOES NOT HUNT MARIANNE COLOURED AS SHE REPLIED BUT MOST PEOPLE DO I WISH SAID MARGARET STRIKING OUT A NOVEL THOUGHT
1154-129976-0014 THAT SOMEBODY WOULD GIVE US ALL A LARGE FORTUNE APIECE
1154-129976-0015 WE ARE ALL UNANIMOUS IN THAT WISH I SUPPOSE SAID ELINOR IN SPITE OF THE INSUFFICIENCY OF WEALTH
1154-129976-0016 MARIANNE LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD NO DOUBT ON THAT POINT
1154-129976-0017 WHAT MAGNIFICENT ORDERS WOULD TRAVEL FROM THIS FAMILY TO LONDON SAID EDWARD IN SUCH AN EVENT WHAT A HAPPY DAY FOR BOOKSELLERS MUSIC SELLERS AND PRINT SHOPS YOU MISS DASHWOOD WOULD GIVE A GENERAL COMMISSION FOR EVERY NEW PRINT OF MERIT TO BE SENT YOU
1154-129976-0018 AND AS FOR MARIANNE I KNOW HER GREATNESS OF SOUL THERE WOULD NOT BE MUSIC ENOUGH IN LONDON TO CONTENT HER AND BOOKS THOMSON COWPER SCOTT
1154-129976-0019 BUT I WAS WILLING TO SHEW YOU THAT I HAD NOT FORGOT OUR OLD DISPUTES I LOVE TO BE REMINDED OF THE PAST EDWARD WHETHER IT BE MELANCHOLY OR GAY I LOVE TO RECALL IT AND YOU WILL NEVER OFFEND ME BY TALKING OF FORMER TIMES
1154-129976-0020 SOME OF IT AT LEAST MY LOOSE CASH WOULD CERTAINLY BE EMPLOYED IN IMPROVING MY COLLECTION OF MUSIC AND BOOKS AND THE BULK OF YOUR FORTUNE WOULD BE LAID OUT IN ANNUITIES ON THE AUTHORS OR THEIR HEIRS NO EDWARD I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO WITH IT
1154-129976-0021 THAT NO ONE CAN EVER BE IN LOVE MORE THAN ONCE IN THEIR LIFE YOUR OPINION ON THAT POINT IS UNCHANGED I PRESUME UNDOUBTEDLY AT MY TIME OF LIFE OPINIONS ARE TOLERABLY FIXED IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT I SHOULD NOW SEE OR HEAR ANY THING TO CHANGE THEM
1154-129976-0022 SHE IS NOT AT ALL ALTERED SHE IS ONLY GROWN A LITTLE MORE GRAVE THAN SHE WAS NAY EDWARD SAID MARIANNE YOU NEED NOT REPROACH ME YOU ARE NOT VERY GAY YOURSELF WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO REPLIED HE WITH A SIGH
1154-129976-0023 NOR DO I THINK IT A PART OF MARIANNE'S SAID ELINOR I SHOULD HARDLY CALL HER A LIVELY GIRL SHE IS VERY EARNEST VERY EAGER IN ALL SHE DOES SOMETIMES TALKS A GREAT DEAL AND ALWAYS WITH ANIMATION BUT SHE IS NOT OFTEN REALLY MERRY
1154-129976-0024 I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED AND YET I HAVE ALWAYS SET HER DOWN AS A LIVELY GIRL I HAVE FREQUENTLY DETECTED MYSELF IN SUCH KIND OF MISTAKES SAID ELINOR IN A TOTAL MISAPPREHENSION OF CHARACTER IN SOME POINT OR OTHER
1154-129976-0025 FANCYING PEOPLE SO MUCH MORE GAY OR GRAVE OR INGENIOUS OR STUPID THAN THEY REALLY ARE AND I CAN HARDLY TELL WHY OR IN WHAT THE DECEPTION ORIGINATED
1154-129976-0026 SOMETIMES ONE IS GUIDED BY WHAT THEY SAY OF THEMSELVES AND VERY FREQUENTLY BY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY OF THEM WITHOUT GIVING ONESELF TIME TO DELIBERATE AND JUDGE
1154-129976-0027 THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN YOUR DOCTRINE I AM SURE NO MARIANNE NEVER MY DOCTRINE HAS NEVER AIMED AT THE SUBJECTION OF THE UNDERSTANDING ALL I HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE HAS BEEN THE BEHAVIOUR
1154-129976-0028 YOU MUST NOT CONFOUND MY MEANING I AM GUILTY I CONFESS OF HAVING OFTEN WISHED YOU TO
1154-129976-0029 YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING YOUR SISTER OVER TO YOUR PLAN OF GENERAL CIVILITY SAID EDWARD TO ELINOR DO YOU GAIN NO GROUND QUITE THE CONTRARY REPLIED ELINOR LOOKING EXPRESSIVELY AT MARIANNE MY JUDGMENT HE RETURNED IS ALL ON YOUR SIDE OF THE QUESTION
1154-129976-0030 BUT I AM AFRAID MY PRACTICE IS MUCH MORE ON YOUR SISTER'S
1154-129976-0031 WHEN I AM ONLY KEPT BACK BY MY NATURAL AWKWARDNESS
1154-129976-0032 MARIANNE HAS NOT SHYNESS TO EXCUSE ANY INATTENTION OF HERS SAID ELINOR SHE KNOWS HER OWN WORTH TOO WELL FOR FALSE SHAME REPLIED EDWARD
1154-129976-0033 IF I COULD PERSUADE MYSELF THAT MY MANNERS WERE PERFECTLY EASY AND GRACEFUL I SHOULD NOT BE SHY BUT YOU WOULD STILL BE RESERVED SAID MARIANNE AND THAT IS WORSE EDWARD STARTED RESERVED AM I RESERVED MARIANNE YES VERY
1154-129976-0034 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU REPLIED HE COLOURING RESERVED HOW IN WHAT MANNER WHAT AM I TO TELL YOU WHAT CAN YOU SUPPOSE ELINOR LOOKED SURPRISED AT HIS EMOTION BUT TRYING TO LAUGH OFF THE SUBJECT SHE SAID TO HIM
1154-129976-0035 ADMIRES AS RAPTUROUSLY AS HERSELF
