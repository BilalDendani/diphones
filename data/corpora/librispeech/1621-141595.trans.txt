1621-141595-0000 CHAPTER FOUR IS ANIMAL LIFE POSSIBLE ON MARS HAVING NOW SHOWN THAT EVEN ADMITTING THE ACCURACY OF ALL MISTER LOWELL'S OBSERVATIONS
1621-141595-0001 AND PROVISIONALLY ACCEPTING ALL HIS CHIEF CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE CLIMATE THE NATURE OF THE SNOW CAPS THE VEGETATION AND THE ANIMAL LIFE OF MARS YET HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE LINES ON ITS SURFACE AS BEING VERITABLY CANALS
1621-141595-0002 CONSTRUCTED BY INTELLIGENT BEINGS FOR THE SPECIAL PURPOSE OF CARRYING WATER TO THE MORE ARID REGIONS IS WHOLLY ERRONEOUS AND RATIONALLY INCONCEIVABLE I NOW PROCEED TO DISCUSS HIS MORE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION
1621-141595-0003 AS TO THE ACTUAL HABITABILITY OF MARS BY A HIGHLY ORGANISED AND INTELLECTUAL RACE OF MATERIAL ORGANIC BEINGS WATER AND AIR ESSENTIAL TO LIFE
1621-141595-0004 HERE FORTUNATELY THE ISSUE IS RENDERED VERY SIMPLE
1621-141595-0005 AND OF PHYSICAL LAWS THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THAT FOR ANY HIGH FORM OF ORGANIC LIFE CERTAIN CONDITIONS WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL ON OUR EARTH MUST ALSO EXIST IN MARS
1621-141595-0006 AND THAT AN ABUNDANT VEGETATION IS ESSENTIAL AND THESE OF COURSE INVOLVE A SURFACE TEMPERATURE
1621-141595-0007 THAT RENDERS THE EXISTENCE OF THESE ESPECIALLY OF WATER POSSIBLE AND AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF A HIGH AND ABUNDANT ANIMAL LIFE BLUE COLOUR THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF WATER
1621-141595-0008 IN ATTEMPTING TO SHOW THAT THESE ESSENTIALS ACTUALLY EXIST ON MARS HE IS NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL HE ADDUCES EVIDENCE OF AN ATMOSPHERE BUT OF AN EXCEEDINGLY SCANTY ONE
1621-141595-0009 SINCE THE GREATEST AMOUNT HE CAN GIVE TO IT IS NOT MORE THAN ABOUT FOUR INCHES OF BAROMETRIC PRESSURE AS WE RECKON IT
1621-141595-0010 AND HE ASSUMES AS HE HAS A FAIR RIGHT TO DO TILL DISPROVED THAT IT CONSISTS OF OXYGEN AND NITROGEN WITH CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER VAPOUR IN APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PROPORTIONS AS WITH US
1621-141595-0011 WITH REGARD TO THE LAST ITEM THE WATER VAPOUR THERE ARE HOWEVER MANY SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES
1621-141595-0012 OCEANS LAKES AND RIVERS AS WELL AS FROM THE EVAPORATION FROM HEATED LANDS AND TROPICAL FORESTS OF MUCH OF THE MOISTURE PRODUCED BY FREQUENT AND ABUNDANT RAINS
1621-141595-0013 NO RAIN AND TROPICAL REGIONS WHICH ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY DESERT
1621-141595-0014 SUPPOSING THAT THE SNOW CAPS ARE NOT FORMED OF FROZEN WATER BUT OF CARBON DIOXIDE OR SOME OTHER HEAVY GAS IN A FROZEN STATE AND MISTER LOWELL EVIDENTLY FEELS THIS TO BE A DIFFICULTY
1621-141595-0015 IN FAVOUR OF THE MELTING SNOWS OF THE POLAR CAPS PRODUCING WATER IS THAT AT THE TIME THEY ARE MELTING A MARGINAL BLUE BAND APPEARS WHICH ACCOMPANIES THEM IN THEIR RETREAT
1621-141595-0016 IS SAID TO PROVE CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE LIQUID IS NOT CARBONIC ACID BUT WATER THIS POINT HE DWELLS UPON REPEATEDLY
1621-141595-0017 IT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE THE CAUSE OF THE DEEP BLUE TINT
1621-141595-0018 BUT THERE IS A VERY WEIGHTY ARGUMENT DEPENDING ON THE MOLECULAR THEORY OF GASES AGAINST THE POLAR CAPS OF MARS BEING COMPOSED OF FROZEN WATER AT ALL THE MASS AND ELASTIC FORCE OF THE SEVERAL GASES IS DUE TO THE GREATER
1621-141595-0019 OR LESS RAPIDITY OF THE VIBRATORY MOTION OF THEIR MOLECULES UNDER IDENTICAL CONDITIONS
1621-141595-0020 AND IT IS FOUND TO BE SO GREAT AS IN CERTAIN CASES TO ENABLE THEM TO OVERCOME THE FORCE OF GRAVITY AND ESCAPE FROM A PLANET'S SURFACE INTO SPACE DOCTOR G JOHNSTONE STONEY
1621-141595-0021 HAS SPECIALLY INVESTIGATED THIS SUBJECT AND HE FINDS
1621-141595-0022 ALL THE GASES COMPOSING ITS ATMOSPHERE BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO RETAIN HYDROGEN AND AS A CONSEQUENCE
1621-141595-0023 AND BY DECOMPOSING VEGETATION YET NO TRACE OF IT IS FOUND IN OUR ATMOSPHERE THE MOON HOWEVER HAVING ONLY ONE EIGHTIETH THE MASS OF THE EARTH CANNOT RETAIN ANY GAS HENCE ITS AIRLESS
1621-141595-0024 AND WATERLESS CONDITION WATER VAPOUR CANNOT EXIST ON MARS NOW DOCTOR STONEY FINDS THAT IN ORDER TO RETAIN WATER VAPOUR PERMANENTLY A PLANET MUST HAVE A MASS
1621-141595-0025 AT LEAST A QUARTER THAT OF THE EARTH BUT THE MASS OF MARS IS ONLY ONE NINTH THAT OF THE EARTH
1621-141595-0026 THAT PREVENT ITS LOSS THIS GAS CANNOT BE PRESENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE MISTER LOWELL DOES NOT REFER TO THIS ARGUMENT AGAINST HIS VIEW NEITHER DOES HE CLAIM THE EVIDENCE OF SPECTROSCOPY IN HIS FAVOUR
1621-141595-0027 BUT OF LATE YEARS IT HAS BEEN DOUBTED AND
1621-141595-0028 AND INCONCLUSIVE ARGUMENT AS THAT
1621-141595-0029 SHOWS THAT HE HIMSELF DOES NOT THINK THE FACT TO BE THUS PROVED IF HE DID
1621-141595-0030 THE MELTING OF THE CAPS ON THE ONE HAND AND THEIR RE FORMING ON THE OTHER AFFIRM THE PRESENCE OF WATER VAPOUR IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE
1621-141595-0031 YET ABSOLUTELY THE ONLY PROOF HE GIVES THAT THE CAPS ARE FROZEN WATER IS THE ALMOST FRIVOLOUS COLOUR ARGUMENT ABOVE REFERRED TO NO SPECTROSCOPIC EVIDENCE OF WATER VAPOUR
1621-141595-0032 HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE
1621-141595-0033 HE ALSO INFORMS ME THAT MARCHAND
1621-141595-0034 SLIPHER AT MISTER LOWELL'S OBSERVATORY
1621-141595-0035 IN THE SPECTRUM OF MARS IT THUS APPEARS THAT SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS ARE QUITE ACCORDANT WITH THE CALCULATIONS FOUNDED ON THE MOLECULAR THEORY OF GASES
1621-141595-0036 AND THEREFORE PRESUMABLY OF LIQUID WATER FROM MARS IT IS TRUE THAT THE SPECTROSCOPIC ARGUMENT IS PURELY NEGATIVE
1621-141595-0037 AGAINST ITS PRESENCE AND TILL SHOWN TO BE ERRONEOUS MUST BE HELD TO BE CONCLUSIVE THIS ABSENCE OF WATER IS OF ITSELF CONCLUSIVE AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF ANIMAL LIFE
1621-141595-0038 AND THAT LIQUID BEING AS OMNIPRESENT THERE AS WATER IS HERE MISTER LOWELL HOWEVER NEVER TAKES THIS GROUND BUT BASES HIS WHOLE THEORY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL IDENTITY OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BODIES OF LIVING ORGANISMS
1621-141595-0039 WHEREVER THEY MAY EXIST IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM IN THE NEXT TWO CHAPTERS I SHALL DISCUSS AN EQUALLY ESSENTIAL CONDITION THAT OF TEMPERATURE
