4005-7258-0000 KARAIN A MEMORY
4005-7258-0001 WE KNEW HIM IN THOSE UNPROTECTED DAYS WHEN WE WERE CONTENT TO HOLD IN OUR HANDS OUR LIVES AND OUR PROPERTY NONE OF US I BELIEVE HAS ANY PROPERTY NOW AND I HEAR THAT MANY NEGLIGENTLY
4005-7258-0002 HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES BUT I AM SURE THAT THE FEW WHO SURVIVE ARE NOT YET SO DIM EYED AS TO MISS IN THE BEFOGGED RESPECTABILITY OF THEIR NEWSPAPERS THE INTELLIGENCE OF VARIOUS NATIVE RISINGS IN THE EASTERN ARCHIPELAGO
4005-7258-0003 SUNSHINE GLEAMS BETWEEN THE LINES OF THOSE SHORT PARAGRAPHS SUNSHINE AND THE GLITTER OF THE SEA A STRANGE NAME WAKES UP MEMORIES
4005-7258-0004 THE PRINTED WORDS SCENT THE SMOKY ATMOSPHERE OF TO DAY FAINTLY WITH THE SUBTLE AND PENETRATING PERFUME AS OF LAND BREEZES BREATHING THROUGH THE STARLIGHT OF BYGONE NIGHTS
4005-7258-0005 A SIGNAL FIRE GLEAMS LIKE A JEWEL ON THE HIGH BROW OF A SOMBRE CLIFF GREAT TREES THE ADVANCED SENTRIES OF IMMENSE FORESTS STAND WATCHFUL AND STILL OVER SLEEPING STRETCHES OF OPEN WATER
4005-7258-0006 LIKE A HANDFUL OF EMERALDS ON A BUCKLER OF STEEL THERE ARE FACES TOO FACES DARK TRUCULENT AND SMILING THE FRANK AUDACIOUS FACES
4005-7258-0007 THEY HAD AN INDEPENDENT BEARING RESOLUTE EYES A RESTRAINED MANNER AND WE SEEM YET TO HEAR THEIR SOFT VOICES SPEAKING OF BATTLES TRAVELS AND ESCAPES BOASTING WITH COMPOSURE
4005-7258-0008 JOKING QUIETLY SOMETIMES IN WELL BRED MURMURS EXTOLLING THEIR OWN VALOUR OUR GENEROSITY OR CELEBRATING WITH LOYAL ENTHUSIASM THE VIRTUES OF THEIR RULER WE REMEMBER THE FACES
4005-7258-0009 THE EYES THE VOICES WE SEE AGAIN THE GLEAM OF SILK AND METAL THE MURMURING STIR OF THAT CROWD BRILLIANT FESTIVE AND MARTIAL AND WE SEEM TO FEEL THE TOUCH OF FRIENDLY BROWN HANDS THAT
4005-7258-0010 AFTER ONE SHORT GRASP RETURN TO REST ON A CHASED HILT THEY WERE KARAIN'S PEOPLE A DEVOTED FOLLOWING THEIR MOVEMENTS HUNG ON HIS LIPS THEY READ THEIR THOUGHTS IN HIS EYES
4005-7258-0011 ON HIS PASSAGE VOICES DIED OUT AS THOUGH HE HAD WALKED GUARDED BY SILENCE AWED WHISPERS FOLLOWED HIM THEY CALLED HIM THEIR WAR CHIEF
4005-7258-0012 HE WAS THE RULER OF THREE VILLAGES ON A NARROW PLAIN THE MASTER OF AN INSIGNIFICANT FOOTHOLD ON THE EARTH OF A CONQUERED FOOTHOLD THAT SHAPED LIKE A YOUNG MOON LAY IGNORED
4005-7258-0013 THE WHOLE OF HIS DOMAIN AND THE AMPLE MOVEMENT SEEMED TO DRIVE BACK ITS LIMITS AUGMENTING IT SUDDENLY INTO SOMETHING SO IMMENSE AND VAGUE THAT FOR A MOMENT
4005-7258-0014 IT APPEARED TO BE BOUNDED ONLY BY THE SKY AND REALLY LOOKING AT THAT PLACE LANDLOCKED FROM THE SEA AND SHUT OFF FROM THE LAND BY THE PRECIPITOUS SLOPES OF MOUNTAINS
4005-7258-0015 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF ANY NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS STILL COMPLETE UNKNOWN AND FULL OF A LIFE THAT WENT ON STEALTHILY WITH A TROUBLING EFFECT OF SOLITUDE
4005-7258-0016 REGRETS AND HOPES A LAND WHERE NOTHING COULD SURVIVE THE COMING OF THE NIGHT AND WHERE EACH SUNRISE LIKE A DAZZLING ACT OF SPECIAL CREATION WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE EVE
4005-7258-0017 AND THE MORROW KARAIN SWEPT HIS HAND OVER IT ALL MINE HE STRUCK THE DECK WITH HIS LONG STAFF THE GOLD HEAD FLASHED LIKE A FALLING STAR
4005-7258-0018 VERY CLOSE BEHIND HIM A SILENT OLD FELLOW IN A RICHLY EMBROIDERED BLACK JACKET ALONE OF ALL THE MALAYS AROUND DID NOT FOLLOW THE MASTERFUL GESTURE WITH A LOOK HE DID NOT EVEN LIFT HIS EYELIDS
4005-7258-0019 HE BOWED HIS HEAD BEHIND HIS MASTER AND WITHOUT STIRRING HELD HILT UP OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER A LONG BLADE IN A SILVER SCABBARD HE WAS THERE ON DUTY
4005-7258-0020 BUT WITHOUT CURIOSITY AND SEEMED WEARY NOT WITH AGE BUT WITH THE POSSESSION OF A BURDENSOME SECRET OF EXISTENCE KARAIN HEAVY AND PROUD HAD A LOFTY POSE AND BREATHED CALMLY
4005-7258-0021 IT WAS OUR FIRST VISIT AND WE LOOKED ABOUT CURIOUSLY THE BAY WAS LIKE A BOTTOMLESS PIT OF INTENSE LIGHT THE CIRCULAR SHEET OF WATER REFLECTED A LUMINOUS SKY
4005-7258-0022 YELLOW SANDS A TORRENT WOUND ABOUT LIKE A DROPPED THREAD CLUMPS OF FRUIT TREES MARKED THE VILLAGES SLIM PALMS PUT THEIR NODDING HEADS TOGETHER ABOVE THE LOW HOUSES
4005-7258-0023 THE SMOKE OF FIRES STOOD UPRIGHT ABOVE THE MASSES OF FLOWERING BUSHES BAMBOO FENCES GLITTERED RUNNING AWAY IN BROKEN LINES BETWEEN THE FIELDS
4005-7258-0024 TOUCHED OUR FACES AND BECAME FORGOTTEN NOTHING MOVED THE SUN BLAZED DOWN INTO A SHADOWLESS HOLLOW
4005-7258-0025 AND STILLNESS IT WAS THE STAGE WHERE DRESSED SPLENDIDLY FOR HIS PART HE STRUTTED INCOMPARABLY DIGNIFIED MADE IMPORTANT BY THE POWER HE HAD
4005-7258-0026 TO AWAKEN AN ABSURD EXPECTATION OF SOMETHING HEROIC GOING TO TAKE PLACE A BURST OF ACTION OR SONG UPON THE VIBRATING TONE OF A WONDERFUL SUNSHINE
4005-7258-0027 HE WAS ORNATE AND DISTURBING FOR ONE COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT DEPTH OF HORRIBLE VOID SUCH AN ELABORATE FRONT COULD BE WORTHY TO HIDE HE WAS NOT MASKED THERE WAS TOO MUCH LIFE IN HIM
4005-7258-0028 IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER WHO HE WAS ONLY A PETTY CHIEF OF A CONVENIENTLY ISOLATED CORNER OF MINDANAO WHERE WE COULD IN COMPARATIVE SAFETY
4005-7258-0029 BREAK THE LAW AGAINST THE TRAFFIC IN FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION WITH THE NATIVES WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SHOULD ONE OF THE MORIBUND SPANISH GUN BOATS BE SUDDENLY GALVANIZED INTO A FLICKER OF ACTIVE LIFE DID NOT TROUBLE US
4005-7258-0030 ONCE WE WERE INSIDE THE BAY SO COMPLETELY DID IT APPEAR OUT OF THE REACH OF A MEDDLING WORLD AND BESIDES IN THOSE DAYS WE WERE IMAGINATIVE ENOUGH TO LOOK WITH A KIND OF JOYOUS EQUANIMITY
4005-7258-0031 BUT HIS QUALITY WAS TO APPEAR CLOTHED IN THE ILLUSION OF UNAVOIDABLE SUCCESS HE SEEMED TOO EFFECTIVE TOO NECESSARY THERE TOO MUCH OF AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR THE EXISTENCE OF HIS LAND AND HIS PEOPLE
4005-7258-0032 TO BE DESTROYED BY ANYTHING SHORT OF AN EARTHQUAKE HE SUMMED UP HIS RACE HIS COUNTRY THE ELEMENTAL FORCE OF ARDENT LIFE OF TROPICAL NATURE HE HAD ITS LUXURIANT STRENGTH
4005-7258-0033 THE PURPLE SEMICIRCLE OF HILLS THE SLIM TREES LEANING OVER HOUSES THE YELLOW SANDS THE STREAMING GREEN OF RAVINES ALL THAT HAD THE CRUDE AND BLENDED COLOURING
4005-7258-0034 THE APPROPRIATENESS ALMOST EXCESSIVE THE SUSPICIOUS IMMOBILITY OF A PAINTED SCENE AND IT ENCLOSED SO PERFECTLY THE ACCOMPLISHED ACTING OF HIS AMAZING PRETENCES THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD
4005-7258-0035 SEEMED SHUT OUT FOREVER FROM THE GORGEOUS SPECTACLE THERE COULD BE NOTHING OUTSIDE IT WAS AS IF THE EARTH HAD GONE ON SPINNING AND HAD LEFT THAT CRUMB OF ITS SURFACE ALONE IN SPACE
4005-7258-0036 HE APPEARED UTTERLY CUT OFF FROM EVERYTHING BUT THE SUNSHINE AND THAT EVEN SEEMED TO BE MADE FOR HIM ALONE ONCE WHEN ASKED WHAT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILLS HE SAID WITH A MEANING SMILE
4005-7258-0037 FRIENDS AND ENEMIES MANY ENEMIES ELSE WHY SHOULD I BUY YOUR RIFLES AND POWDER HE WAS ALWAYS LIKE THIS WORD PERFECT IN HIS PART
4005-7258-0038 PLAYING UP FAITHFULLY TO THE MYSTERIES AND CERTITUDES OF HIS SURROUNDINGS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES NOTHING ELSE IT WAS IMPALPABLE AND VAST THE EARTH HAD INDEED
4005-7258-0039 FRIENDS AND ENEMIES HE MIGHT HAVE ADDED AND MEMORIES AT LEAST AS FAR AS HE HIMSELF WAS CONCERNED BUT HE NEGLECTED TO MAKE THAT POINT THEN
4005-7258-0040 IT MADE ITSELF LATER ON THOUGH BUT IT WAS AFTER THE DAILY PERFORMANCE IN THE WINGS SO TO SPEAK AND WITH THE LIGHTS OUT MEANTIME HE FILLED THE STAGE WITH BARBAROUS DIGNITY
4005-7258-0041 AND HAD LOST ALL CONCERN FOR THE FUTURE HE GAVE THEM WISDOM ADVICE REWARD PUNISHMENT LIFE OR DEATH WITH THE SAME SERENITY OF ATTITUDE AND VOICE HE UNDERSTOOD IRRIGATION
4005-7258-0042 AND THE ART OF WAR THE QUALITIES OF WEAPONS AND THE CRAFT OF BOAT BUILDING HE COULD CONCEAL HIS HEART HAD MORE ENDURANCE HE COULD SWIM LONGER AND STEER A CANOE BETTER THAN ANY OF HIS PEOPLE
4005-7258-0043 AND NEGOTIATE MORE TORTUOUSLY THAN ANY MAN OF HIS RACE I KNEW HE WAS AN ADVENTURER OF THE SEA AN OUTCAST A RULER AND MY VERY GOOD FRIEND I WISH HIM A QUICK DEATH
4005-7258-0044 IN A STAND UP FIGHT A DEATH IN SUNSHINE FOR HE HAD KNOWN REMORSE AND POWER AND NO MAN CAN DEMAND MORE FROM LIFE DAY AFTER DAY HE APPEARED BEFORE US
4005-7258-0045 BECAME BLACK SHADOWS TOWERING HIGH UPON A CLEAR SKY ABOVE THEM THE GLITTERING CONFUSION OF STARS RESEMBLED A MAD TURMOIL STILLED BY A GESTURE SOUNDS CEASED MEN SLEPT
