1968-145732-0000 THEY WENT ON A LONG WAY UNTIL THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A HIND WITH A GOLD RING ON ITS HORNS THE PRINCE WAS EAGER TO CATCH IT IF POSSIBLE SO THEY GAVE CHASE AND RODE ON WITHOUT STOPPING
1968-145732-0001 UNTIL ALL THE HORSES BEGAN TO FOUNDER BENEATH THEM AT LAST THE PRINCE'S HORSE GAVE WAY TOO AND THEN THERE CAME OVER THEM A DARKNESS SO BLACK THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER SEE THE HIND
1968-145732-0002 BY THIS TIME THEY WERE FAR AWAY FROM ANY HOUSE AND THOUGHT IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MAKING THEIR WAY HOME AGAIN BUT THEY FOUND THEY HAD GOT LOST NOW
1968-145732-0003 BUT SOON EACH BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE KNEW THE RIGHT WAY BEST SO THEY SEPARATED AND ALL WENT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THE PRINCE TOO HAD GOT LOST LIKE THE REST
1968-145732-0004 AND WANDERED ON FOR A TIME UNTIL HE CAME TO A LITTLE CLEARING IN THE FOREST NOT FAR FROM THE SEA WHERE HE SAW A WOMAN SITTING ON A CHAIR AND A BIG BARREL STANDING BESIDE HER
1968-145732-0005 THE PRINCE WENT UP TO HER AND SALUTED HER POLITELY AND SHE RECEIVED HIM VERY GRACIOUSLY HE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE BARREL THEN AND SAW LYING AT THE BOTTOM AN UNUSUALLY BEAUTIFUL GOLD RING
1968-145732-0006 WHICH PLEASED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES OFF IT
1968-145732-0007 TO GET IT FOR WHICH THE PRINCE THANKED HER AND SAID IT WAS AT LEAST WORTH TRYING SO HE LEANED OVER INTO THE BARREL WHICH DID NOT SEEM VERY DEEP AND THOUGHT HE WOULD EASILY REACH THE RING
1968-145732-0008 SAYING THAT NOW HE COULD TAKE UP HIS QUARTERS THERE THEN SHE FIXED THE TOP ON THE BARREL AND THREW IT OUT INTO THE SEA THE PRINCE THOUGHT HIMSELF IN A BAD PLIGHT NOW
1968-145732-0009 AS HE FELT THE BARREL FLOATING OUT FROM THE LAND
1968-145732-0010 BUT AT LAST HE FELT THAT THE BARREL WAS KNOCKING AGAINST ROCKS AT WHICH HE WAS A LITTLE CHEERED THINKING IT WAS PROBABLY LAND AND NOT MERELY A
1968-145732-0011 BEING SOMETHING OF A SWIMMER HE AT LAST MADE UP HIS MIND TO KICK THE BOTTOM OUT OF THE BARREL
1968-145732-0012 FOR THE ROCKS BY THE SEA WERE SMOOTH AND LEVEL BUT OVERHEAD THERE WERE HIGH CLIFFS IT SEEMED DIFFICULT TO GET UP THESE BUT HE WENT ALONG THE FOOT OF THEM FOR A LITTLE TILL AT LAST HE TRIED TO CLIMB UP WHICH AT LAST HE DID
1968-145732-0013 WHICH WAS COVERED WITH FOREST WITH APPLES GROWING AND ALTOGETHER PLEASANT AS FAR AS THE LAND WAS CONCERNED AFTER HE HAD BEEN THERE SEVERAL DAYS HE ONE DAY HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE FOREST WHICH MADE HIM TERRIBLY AFRAID
1968-145732-0014 SO THAT HE RAN TO HIDE HIMSELF AMONG THE TREES THEN HE SAW A GIANT APPROACHING DRAGGING A SLEDGE LOADED WITH WOOD AND MAKING STRAIGHT FOR HIM SO THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING FOR IT
1968-145732-0015 WHEN THE GIANT CAME ACROSS HIM HE STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT THE PRINCE FOR A LITTLE
1968-145732-0016 AND CARRIED HIM HOME TO HIS HOUSE AND WAS EXCEEDINGLY KIND TO HIM HE GAVE HIM TO HIS WIFE
1968-145732-0017 AND SHE COULD HAVE IT TO HELP HER IN THE HOUSE THE OLD WOMAN WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND BEGAN TO FONDLE THE PRINCE WITH THE UTMOST DELIGHT HE STAYED THERE WITH THEM AND WAS VERY WILLING AND OBEDIENT TO THEM IN EVERYTHING
1968-145732-0018 EVERY DAY ONE DAY THE GIANT TOOK HIM ROUND AND SHOWED HIM ALL HIS ROOMS EXCEPT THE PARLOUR
1968-145732-0019 THINKING THERE MUST BE SOME VERY RARE TREASURE THERE SO ONE DAY WHEN THE GIANT HAD GONE INTO THE FOREST HE TRIED TO GET INTO THE PARLOUR AND MANAGED TO GET THE DOOR OPEN HALF WAY THEN
1968-145732-0020 HE SAW THAT SOME LIVING CREATURE MOVED INSIDE AND RAN ALONG THE FLOOR TOWARDS HIM AND SAID SOMETHING WHICH MADE HIM SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE SPRANG BACK FROM THE DOOR AND SHUT IT AGAIN
1968-145732-0021 AS SOON AS THE FRIGHT BEGAN TO PASS OFF HE TRIED IT AGAIN FOR HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HEAR WHAT IT SAID BUT THINGS WENT JUST AS BEFORE WITH HIM HE THEN GOT
1968-145732-0022 AND SUMMONING UP ALL HIS COURAGE TRIED IT
1968-145732-0023 AND OPENED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM AND STOOD FIRM THEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS A BIG DOG WHICH SPOKE TO HIM AND SAID CHOOSE ME PRINCE RING
1968-145732-0024 THE PRINCE WENT AWAY RATHER AFRAID THINKING WITH HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NO GREAT TREASURE AFTER ALL BUT ALL THE SAME WHAT IT HAD SAID TO HIM STUCK IN HIS MIND
1968-145732-0025 BUT ONE DAY THE LATTER CAME TO HIM AND SAID HE WOULD NOW TAKE HIM OVER TO THE MAINLAND OUT OF THE ISLAND FOR HE HIMSELF HAD NO LONG TIME TO LIVE HE ALSO THANKED HIM FOR HIS GOOD SERVICE
1968-145732-0026 AND TOLD HIM TO CHOOSE SOME ONE OF HIS POSSESSIONS
1968-145732-0027 RING THANKED HIM HEARTILY AND SAID THERE WAS NO NEED TO PAY HIM FOR HIS SERVICES THEY WERE SO LITTLE WORTH
1968-145732-0028 THE GIANT WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND SAID THERE YOU CHOSE MY OLD WOMAN'S RIGHT HAND BUT I MUST NOT BREAK MY WORD UPON THIS HE WENT TO GET THE DOG
1968-145732-0029 WHICH CAME RUNNING WITH SIGNS OF GREAT DELIGHT BUT THE PRINCE WAS SO MUCH AFRAID OF IT THAT IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM SHOWING HIS ALARM
1968-145732-0030 WHERE HE SAW A STONE BOAT WHICH WAS JUST BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE TWO OF THEM
1968-145732-0031 ON REACHING THE MAINLAND THE GIANT TOOK A FRIENDLY FAREWELL OF RING
1968-145732-0032 HE MIGHT TAKE POSSESSION OF ALL THAT WAS IN THE ISLAND AFTER HE AND HIS WIFE DIED WHICH WOULD HAPPEN WITHIN TWO WEEKS FROM THAT TIME THE PRINCE THANKED HIM
1968-145732-0033 AND THE GIANT RETURNED HOME WHILE RING WENT UP SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SEA BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT LAND HE HAD COME TO AND WAS AFRAID TO SPEAK TO THE DOG
1968-145732-0034 YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH CURIOSITY SEEING YOU NEVER ASK MY NAME THE PRINCE THEN FORCED HIMSELF TO ASK WHAT IS YOUR NAME YOU HAD BEST CALL ME SNATI SNATI SAID THE DOG
1968-145732-0035 NOW WE ARE COMING TO A KING'S SEAT AND YOU MUST ASK THE KING TO KEEP US ALL WINTER AND TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE ROOM FOR BOTH OF US
1968-145732-0036 TO KEEP THEM ALL THE WINTER TO WHICH HE AGREED WHEN THE KING'S MEN SAW THE DOG THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH AT IT AND MAKE AS IF THEY WOULD TEASE IT BUT WHEN THE PRINCE SAW THIS HE ADVISED THEM NOT TO DO IT
1968-145732-0037 OR THEY MIGHT HAVE THE WORST OF IT THEY REPLIED THAT THEY DIDN'T CARE A BIT WHAT HE THOUGHT
1968-145732-0038 ANYTHING THE KING REPLIED THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHORT TIME SINCE HE HAD COME THERE RED THEN ASKED HIM TO SEND THEM BOTH TO CUT DOWN WOOD NEXT MORNING AND SEE WHICH OF THEM COULD DO MOST WORK
1968-145732-0039 SNATI SNATI HEARD THIS AND TOLD IT TO RING ADVISING HIM TO ASK THE KING FOR TWO AXES SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE ONE IN RESERVE IF THE FIRST ONE GOT BROKEN NEXT MORNING THE KING
1968-145732-0040 AND BOTH AGREED RING GOT THE TWO AXES AND EACH WENT HIS OWN WAY BUT WHEN THE PRINCE HAD GOT OUT INTO THE WOOD SNATI TOOK ONE OF THE AXES AND BEGAN TO HEW ALONG WITH HIM
1968-145732-0041 WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS BIG I SUSPECTED SAID THE KING THAT RING WAS NOT QUITE USELESS
1968-145732-0042 RING WAS NOW IN FAR GREATER ESTEEM WITH THE KING THAN BEFORE AND RED WAS ALL THE MORE DISCONTENTED ONE DAY HE CAME TO THE KING AND SAID IF RING IS SUCH A MIGHTY MAN
1968-145732-0043 I THINK YOU MIGHT ASK HIM TO KILL THE WILD OXEN IN THE WOOD HERE AND FLAY THEM THE SAME DAY
1968-145732-0044 AND ONE DAY ASKED RING TO GO AND KILL THE OXEN THAT WERE IN THE WOOD FOR HIM AND BRING THEIR HORNS AND HIDES TO HIM IN THE EVENING
1968-145732-0045 RING WAS QUITE READY AND WENT OFF AT ONCE TO THE GREAT DELIGHT OF RED WHO WAS NOW SURE OF HIS DEATH
1968-145732-0046 THEY CAME BELLOWING TO MEET HIM ONE OF THEM WAS TREMENDOUSLY BIG THE OTHER RATHER LESS RING GREW TERRIBLY AFRAID HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM ASKED SNATI NOT WELL AT ALL
1968-145732-0047 SAID THE PRINCE WE CAN DO NOTHING ELSE SAID SNATI THAN ATTACK THEM
1968-145732-0048 AND I SHALL TAKE THE OTHER WITH THIS SNATI LEAPT AT THE BIG ONE
1968-145732-0049 AND BY THE TIME SNATI CAME TO HELP HIM THE OX HAD NEARLY GOT HIM UNDER BUT SNATI WAS NOT SLOW IN HELPING HIS MASTER TO KILL IT EACH OF THEM THEN BEGAN TO FLAY THEIR OWN OX
1968-145732-0050 IN THE EVENING AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED THIS TASK THE PRINCE THOUGHT HIMSELF UNFIT TO CARRY ALL THE HORNS AND BOTH THE HIDES SO SNATI TOLD HIM TO LAY THEM ALL ON HIS BACK UNTIL THEY GOT TO THE PALACE GATE
1968-145732-0051 THE PRINCE AGREED AND LAID EVERYTHING ON THE DOG EXCEPT THE SKIN OF THE SMALLER OX WHICH HE STAGGERED ALONG WITH HIMSELF AT THE PALACE GATE HE LEFT EVERYTHING LYING WENT BEFORE THE KING
1968-145732-0052 AND ASKED HIM TO COME THAT LENGTH WITH HIM AND THERE HANDED OVER TO HIM THE HIDES AND HORNS OF THE OXEN THE KING WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT HIS VALOUR AND SAID HE KNEW NO ONE LIKE HIM AND THANKED HIM HEARTILY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE
1968-145732-0053 AND HELD HIM TO BE A GREAT HERO NOR COULD RED ANY LONGER SAY ANYTHING AGAINST HIM
1968-145732-0054 DESTROY HIM ONE DAY A GOOD IDEA CAME INTO HIS HEAD HE CAME TO THE KING AND SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO HIM WHAT IS THAT SAID THE KING RED SAID
1968-145732-0055 THAT HE HAD JUST REMEMBERED THE GOLD CLOAK GOLD CHESS BOARD AND BRIGHT GOLD PIECE THAT THE KING HAD LOST ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE DON'T REMIND ME OF THEM SAID THE KING RED HOWEVER
1968-145732-0056 WENT ON TO SAY THAT SINCE RING WAS SUCH A MIGHTY MAN THAT HE COULD DO EVERYTHING IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM TO ADVISE THE KING TO ASK HIM TO SEARCH FOR THESE TREASURES
1968-145732-0057 HIS DAUGHTER THE KING REPLIED THAT HE THOUGHT IT ALTOGETHER UNBECOMING TO PROPOSE SUCH A THING TO RING
1968-145732-0058 UNTIL THE KING GAVE IN TO HIM ONE DAY A MONTH OR SO BEFORE CHRISTMAS THE KING SPOKE TO RING SAYING THAT HE WISHED TO ASK A GREAT FAVOUR OF HIM
1968-145732-0059 WHAT IS THAT SAID RING
1968-145732-0060 THAT YOU FIND FOR ME MY GOLD CLOAK MY GOLD CHESS BOARD AND MY BRIGHT GOLD PIECE THAT WERE STOLEN FROM ME
1968-145732-0061 IF YOU CAN BRING THEM TO ME BEFORE CHRISTMAS
1968-145732-0062 SAID THE KING I DON'T KNOW RING NOW LEFT THE KING AND WAS VERY SILENT FOR HE SAW HE WAS IN A GREAT DIFFICULTY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
1968-145732-0063 HE THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT TO HAVE SUCH A CHANCE OF WINNING THE KING'S DAUGHTER SNATI NOTICED THAT HIS MASTER WAS AT A LOSS AND SAID TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD NOT DISREGARD WHAT THE KING HAD ASKED HIM TO DO
1968-145732-0064 OTHERWISE HE WOULD GET INTO GREAT DIFFICULTIES THE PRINCE ASSENTED TO THIS AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY AFTER HE HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF THE KING AND WAS SETTING OUT ON THE SEARCH
1968-145732-0065 SNATI SAID TO HIM NOW YOU MUST FIRST OF ALL GO ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND GATHER AS MUCH SALT AS EVER YOU CAN THE PRINCE DID SO AND GATHERED SO MUCH SALT
1968-145732-0066 THAT HE COULD HARDLY CARRY IT BUT SNATI SAID THROW IT ON MY BACK WHICH HE ACCORDINGLY DID AND THE DOG THEN RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCE UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF A STEEP CLIFF
1968-145732-0067 WE MUST GO UP HERE SAID SNATI I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE CHILD'S PLAY SAID THE PRINCE HOLD FAST BY MY TAIL SAID SNATI
1968-145732-0068 UP ON THE LOWEST SHELF OF THE ROCK THE PRINCE BEGAN TO GET GIDDY BUT UP WENT SNATI ON TO THE SECOND SHELF RING WAS NEARLY SWOONING BY THIS TIME BUT SNATI
1968-145732-0069 AND REACHED THE TOP OF THE CLIFF WHERE THE PRINCE FELL DOWN IN A FAINT AFTER A LITTLE HOWEVER HE RECOVERED AGAIN AND THEY WENT A SHORT DISTANCE ALONG A LEVEL PLAIN UNTIL THEY CAME
1968-145732-0070 TO A CAVE THIS WAS ON CHRISTMAS EVE THEY WENT UP ABOVE THE CAVE AND FOUND A WINDOW IN IT THROUGH WHICH THEY LOOKED AND SAW FOUR TROLLS LYING ASLEEP BESIDE THE FIRE OVER WHICH
1968-145732-0071 A LARGE PORRIDGE POT WAS HANGING NOW YOU MUST EMPTY ALL THE SALT INTO THE PORRIDGE POT SAID SNATI RING DID SO AND SOON THE TROLLS WAKENED UP
1968-145732-0072 SHE SAID THE PORRIDGE IS SALT I GOT THE MILK BY WITCHCRAFT YESTERDAY OUT OF FOUR KINGDOMS
1968-145732-0073 BUT AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED IT THE OLD HAG GREW SO THIRSTY THAT SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND ASKED HER DAUGHTER TO GO OUT AND BRING HER SOME WATER FROM THE RIVER THAT RAN NEAR BY
1968-145732-0074 I WON'T GO SAID SHE UNLESS YOU LEND ME YOUR BRIGHT GOLD PIECE
1968-145732-0075 SAID THE HAG DIE THEN SAID THE GIRL
1968-145732-0076 AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO THE RIVER SHE LAY DOWN TO TAKE A DRINK OF THE WATER
1968-145732-0077 HAD GOT DOWN OFF THE ROOF AND THRUST HER HEAD FIRST INTO THE RIVER THE OLD HAG BEGAN NOW TO LONG FOR THE WATER AND SAID THAT THE GIRL WOULD BE RUNNING ABOUT WITH THE GOLD PIECE ALL OVER THE PLAIN
1968-145732-0078 SO SHE ASKED HER SON TO GO AND GET HER A DROP OF WATER I WON'T GO SAID HE UNLESS I GET THE GOLD CLOAK
1968-145732-0079 DIE THEN SAID THE SON
1968-145732-0080 HE PUT ON THE CLOAK AND WHEN HE CAME OUTSIDE IT SHONE SO BRIGHT THAT HE COULD SEE TO GO WITH IT ON REACHING THE RIVER HE WENT TO TAKE A DRINK LIKE HIS SISTER BUT AT THAT MOMENT RING AND SNATI
1968-145732-0081 SPRANG UPON HIM TOOK THE CLOAK FROM HIM AND THREW HIM INTO THE RIVER THE OLD HAG COULD STAND THE THIRST NO LONGER AND ASKED HER HUSBAND TO GO FOR A DRINK FOR HER THE BRATS SHE SAID

1968-145732-0084 SINCE YOU ARE JUST LIKE THESE TWO BRATS THE OLD TROLL NOW WENT OUT WITH THE GOLD CHESS BOARD AND DOWN TO THE RIVER AND WAS ABOUT TO TAKE A DRINK WHEN RING AND SNATI CAME UPON HIM TOOK THE CHESS BOARD FROM HIM
1968-145732-0085 AND THREW HIM INTO THE RIVER BEFORE THEY HAD GOT BACK AGAIN HOWEVER AND UP ON TOP OF THE CAVE
1968-145732-0086 SNATI IMMEDIATELY SPRANG UPON HIM AND RING ASSISTED IN THE ATTACK AND AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE THEY MASTERED HIM A SECOND TIME WHEN THEY GOT BACK AGAIN
1968-145732-0087 NOW WE MUST GO IN AT ONCE SAID SNATI

1968-145732-0090 KEPT POURING BOILING PORRIDGE ON HER WITHOUT STOPPING
1968-145732-0091 THEN THEY BURNED THE OLD TROLL AND HER TO ASHES AND EXPLORED THE CAVE WHERE THEY FOUND PLENTY OF GOLD AND TREASURES THE MOST VALUABLE OF THESE THEY CARRIED WITH THEM AS FAR AS THE CLIFF
1968-145732-0092 AND LEFT THEM THERE THEN THEY HASTENED HOME TO THE KING WITH HIS THREE TREASURES WHERE THEY ARRIVED LATE ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT AND RING HANDED THEM OVER TO HIM THE KING
1968-145732-0093 WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY AND WAS ASTONISHED AT HOW CLEVER A MAN RING WAS IN ALL KINDS OF FEATS SO THAT HE ESTEEMED HIM STILL MORE HIGHLY THAN BEFORE AND BETROTHED HIS DAUGHTER TO HIM
1968-145732-0094 AND AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED EATING AND DRINKING IN THE HALL WENT OFF TO SLEEP IN HIS OWN ROOM SNATI HOWEVER ASKED PERMISSION TO SLEEP IN THE PRINCE'S BED
1968-145732-0095 RING SAID HE WAS WELCOME TO DO SO
1968-145732-0096 SO SNATI WENT UP INTO THE PRINCE'S BED BUT AFTER A TIME HE CAME BACK AND TOLD RING HE COULD GO THERE HIMSELF NOW BUT TO TAKE CARE NOT TO MEDDLE WITH ANYTHING THAT WAS IN THE BED
1968-145732-0097 HIS INTENDED SON IN LAW WAS FOR HE HAD DONE THIS TO HIM WITHOUT ANY CAUSE WHATEVER THE KING BECAME VERY ANGRY AND SAID HE WOULD SOON FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT IT AND IF RING HAD CUT OFF HIS HAND
1968-145732-0098 HE SHOULD BE HANGED BUT IF IT WAS OTHERWISE THEN RED SHOULD DIE SO THE KING SENT FOR RING AND ASKED HIM FOR WHAT REASON HE HAD DONE THIS SNATI HOWEVER
1968-145732-0099 HAD JUST TOLD RING WHAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT AND IN REPLY HE ASKED THE KING
1968-145732-0100 AND SAW LYING ON THE BED
1968-145732-0101 THIS HAND SAID RING CAME OVER THE PARTITION DURING THE NIGHT
1968-145732-0102 IF I HAD NOT DEFENDED MYSELF THE KING
1968-145732-0103 HIS OWN LIFE AND THAT RED WAS WELL WORTHY OF DEATH SO RED WAS HANGED AND RING MARRIED THE KING'S DAUGHTER
1968-145732-0104 AND SAW AN UGLY DOG'S SKIN LYING NEAR HIM AND A BEAUTIFUL PRINCE IN THE BED
1968-145732-0105 AND THEN SHOOK THE PRINCE WHO WAS LYING UNCONSCIOUS UNTIL HE WOKE UP THE BRIDEGROOM THEN
1968-145732-0106 HE HAD LOST HIS MOTHER AND IN HER PLACE HIS FATHER HAD MARRIED A WITCH WHO HAD LAID A SPELL ON HIM THAT HE SHOULD TURN INTO A DOG AND NEVER BE RELEASED FROM THE SPELL
1968-145732-0107 UNLESS A PRINCE OF THE SAME NAME AS HIMSELF ALLOWED HIM TO SLEEP AT HIS FEET THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER HIS MARRIAGE HE ADDED FURTHER AS SOON
1968-145732-0108 SO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT FREE ME FROM THE SPELL SHE WAS THE HIND THAT YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS CHASED SHE WAS THE WOMAN THAT YOU FOUND IN THE CLEARING WITH THE BARREL AND THE OLD HAG THAT WE JUST NOW KILLED IN THE CAVE
1968-145732-0109 AFTER THE FEASTING WAS OVER THE TWO NAMESAKES ALONG WITH OTHER MEN WENT TO THE CLIFF AND BROUGHT ALL THE TREASURE HOME TO THE PALACE
