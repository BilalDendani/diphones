2487-169011-0000 IT WAS A MORNING OF THE LATTER SUMMER TIME A MORNING OF LINGERING DEWS WHEN THE GRASS IS NEVER DRY IN THE SHADE
2487-169011-0001 WITH SMALL DROPS AND DASHES OF WATER CHANGING THE COLOUR OF THEIR SPARKLE AT EVERY MOVEMENT OF THE AIR AND ELSEWHERE HANGING ON TWIGS LIKE SMALL SILVER FRUIT THE THREADS OF GARDEN SPIDERS APPEARED THICK AND POLISHED
2487-169011-0002 IN THE DRY AND SUNNY PLACES DOZENS OF LONG LEGGED CRANE FLIES WHIZZED OFF THE GRASS AT EVERY STEP THE PASSER TOOK FANCY DAY AND HER FRIEND SUSAN DEWY THE TRANTER'S DAUGHTER WERE IN SUCH A SPOT AS THIS
2487-169011-0003 PULLING DOWN A BOUGH LADEN WITH EARLY APPLES THREE MONTHS HAD ELAPSED SINCE DICK AND FANCY HAD JOURNEYED TOGETHER FROM BUDMOUTH AND THE COURSE OF THEIR LOVE HAD RUN ON VIGOROUSLY DURING THE WHOLE TIME
2487-169011-0004 THERE HAD BEEN JUST ENOUGH DIFFICULTY ATTENDING ITS DEVELOPMENT AND JUST ENOUGH FINESSE REQUIRED IN KEEPING IT PRIVATE TO LEND THE PASSION AN EVER INCREASING FRESHNESS ON FANCY'S PART WHILST WHETHER FROM THESE ACCESSORIES OR NOT
2487-169011-0005 DICK'S HEART HAD BEEN AT ALL TIMES AS FOND AS COULD BE DESIRED BUT THERE WAS A CLOUD ON FANCY'S HORIZON NOW SHE IS SO WELL OFF BETTER THAN ANY OF US SUSAN DEWY WAS SAYING
2487-169011-0006 HER FATHER FARMS FIVE HUNDRED ACRES AND SHE MIGHT MARRY A DOCTOR OR CURATE OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND IF SHE CONTRIVED A LITTLE
2487-169011-0007 REPLIED FANCY UNEASILY HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE THERE TILL IT WAS TOO LATE TO REFUSE THE INVITATION SAID SUSAN

2487-169011-0014 LOOK SUSAN DO IS HER HAIR AS SOFT AND LONG AS THIS FANCY PULLED FROM ITS COIL UNDER HER HAT A TWINE OF HER OWN HAIR AND STRETCHED IT DOWN HER SHOULDER TO SHOW ITS LENGTH
2487-169011-0015 LOOKING AT SUSAN TO CATCH HER OPINION FROM HER EYES
2487-169011-0016 SAID MISS DEWY FANCY PAUSED HOPELESSLY I WISH MINE WAS LIGHTER LIKE HERS SHE CONTINUED MOURNFULLY
2487-169011-0017 I DON'T KNOW FANCY ABSTRACTEDLY EXTENDED HER VISION TO SURVEY A YELLOW BUTTERFLY AND A RED AND BLACK BUTTERFLY THAT WERE FLITTING ALONG IN COMPANY AND THEN BECAME AWARE THAT DICK WAS ADVANCING UP THE GARDEN
