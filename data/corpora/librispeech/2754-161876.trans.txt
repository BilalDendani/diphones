2754-161876-0000 WERE CONTINUALLY MORTIFIED AND UNDER PERPETUAL RESTRAINT TO CONQUER THEM TOTALLY IT IS NECESSARY TO DENY THEM THE SMALLEST RELAXATION UNTIL THE VICTORY IS COMPLETED
2754-161876-0001 WE SEE THOSE WHO CONTENT THEMSELVES PRACTICING GREAT
2754-161876-0002 TO DESTROY THEIR POWER THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS IS IN GENERAL TO DENY THEM FIRMLY WHAT WILL PLEASE
2754-161876-0003 UNTIL THEY ARE REDUCED TO BE WITHOUT DESIRE OR REPUGNANCE IF WE ATTEMPT DURING THE WARFARE TO GRANT THEM ANY RELAXATION WE ACT LIKE THOSE WHO
2754-161876-0004 UNDER PRETEXT OF STRENGTHENING A MAN
2754-161876-0005 SHOULD GIVE HIM FROM TIME TO TIME A LITTLE NOURISHMENT
2754-161876-0006 AND POSTPONE HIS DEATH IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH THE DEATH OF THE SENSES THE POWERS THE UNDERSTANDING AND SELF WILL IF WE DO NOT ERADICATE
2754-161876-0007 SUBSISTING IN THESE WE SUPPORT THEM IN A DYING LIFE TO THE END THIS STATE AND ITS TERMINATION ARE CLEARLY SET FORTH BY PAUL
2754-161876-0008 BUT
2754-161876-0009 IT IS ONLY BY A TOTAL DEATH TO SELF WE CAN BE LOST IN GOD HE WHO IS THUS DEAD HAS NO FURTHER NEED OF MORTIFICATION
2754-161876-0010 THE VERY END OF MORTIFICATION IS ACCOMPLISHED IN HIM AND ALL IS BECOME NEW IT IS AN UNHAPPY ERROR IN THOSE GOOD SOULS WHO HAVE ARRIVED AT A
2754-161876-0011 CONQUEST OF THE BODILY SENSES THROUGH THIS UNREMITTED AND CONTINUAL MORTIFICATION THAT THEY SHOULD STILL CONTINUE
2754-161876-0012 THE SWEET AS THE BITTER AND BEND THEIR WHOLE ATTENTION TO A LABOR OF GREATER IMPORTANCE NAMELY THE MORTIFICATION OF THE MIND AND SELF WILL
2754-161876-0013 THEY SHOULD BEGIN BY DROPPING ALL THE ACTIVITY OF SELF WHICH CAN NEVER BE DONE WITHOUT THE MOST PROFOUND PRAYER NO MORE THAN THE DEATH OF THE SENSES
2754-161876-0014 CAN BE PERFECTED WITHOUT PROFOUND RECOLLECTION JOINED TO MORTIFICATION INDEED RECOLLECTION IS THE CHIEF MEANS WHEREBY
2754-161876-0015 WE ATTAIN TO A CONQUEST OF THE SENSES IT DETACHES AND SEPARATES US FROM THEM AND SWEETLY SAPS THE VERY CAUSE
2754-161876-0016 THEIR INFLUENCE OVER US THE MORE THOU DIDST AUGMENT MY LOVE AND MY PATIENCE O MY LORD THE LESS
2754-161876-0017 BUT LOVE RENDERED THEM EASY TO BEAR O YE POOR SOULS WHO EXHAUST YOURSELVES WITH NEEDLESS VEXATION IF YOU WOULD BUT SEEK GOD IN YOUR HEARTS
2754-161876-0018 THERE WOULD BE A SPEEDY END TO ALL YOUR TROUBLES THE INCREASE OF CROSSES WOULD PROPORTIONATELY INCREASE YOUR DELIGHT LOVE AT THE BEGINNING
2754-161876-0019 ANOTHER KIND WAS POINTED TO ME AND I WAS INWARDLY LED TO PURSUE IT DIVINE LOVE SO ENLIGHTENED MY HEART AND SO SCRUTINIZED INTO ITS SECRET SPRINGS
2754-161876-0020 THAT THE SMALLEST DEFECTS BECAME EXPOSED IF I WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK SOMETHING WRONG WAS INSTANTLY POINTED TO ME AND I WAS COMPELLED TO SILENCE
2754-161876-0021 FAULTS WERE PRESENTLY DISCOVERED IN EVERY ACTION THERE WAS SOMETHING DEFECTIVE IN MY MORTIFICATIONS MY PENANCES MY ALMS GIVING MY RETIREMENT I WAS FAULTY
2754-161876-0022 I OBSERVED THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG IF I SPOKE ANY WAY IN MY OWN FAVOR I SAW PRIDE IF I SAID WITHIN MYSELF ALAS I WILL SPEAK NO MORE
2754-161876-0023 IT WAS NOT THAT I WAS PARTICULARLY ATTENTIVE OVER MYSELF FOR IT WAS EVEN WITH CONSTRAINT THAT I COULD LOOK AT ALL AT MYSELF MY ATTENTION TOWARD GOD
2754-161876-0024 WAS WITHOUT INTERMISSION
2754-161876-0025 ALL THINGS I KNEW NOT HOW TO COMMUNICATE WHAT I FELT TO ANYONE I WAS SO LOST TO MYSELF THAT I COULD SCARCELY GO ABOUT SELF EXAMINATION
2754-161876-0026 WHEN I ATTEMPTED IT ALL IDEAS OF MYSELF IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED I FOUND MYSELF
2754-161876-0027 THE MOST LOVING AND BELOVED OF THY CHILDREN I MEAN NOT EXTERNALLY FOR THIS WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO THE SMALLEST FAULT IN A SOUL THAT GOD IS ABOUT TO PURIFY RADICALLY
2754-161876-0028 THE PUNISHMENTS IT CAN INFLICT ON ITSELF ARE RATHER GRATIFICATIONS AND REFRESHMENTS THAN OTHERWISE INDEED THE MANNER IN WHICH
2754-161876-0029 EXCEPT TO EXPERIENCED SOULS
2754-161876-0030 AN INTERNAL BURNING A SECRET FIRE SENT FROM GOD TO PURGE AWAY THE FAULT GIVING EXTREME PAIN UNTIL THIS PURIFICATION IS COMPLETE IT IS LIKE A
2754-161876-0031 SHE FRUSTRATES GOD'S DESIGNS TOWARD HER IT IS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE TO KNOW WHAT USE TO MAKE OF THE DISTRESS THE WHOLE OF ONE'S SPIRITUAL ADVANCEMENT
2754-161876-0032 WE SHOULD AT THESE SEASONS OF INTERNAL
2754-161876-0033 CO OPERATE WITH GOD ENDURE THIS CONSUMING TORTURE IN ITS UTMOST EXTENT WHILE IT CONTINUES WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO LESSEN OR INCREASE IT
