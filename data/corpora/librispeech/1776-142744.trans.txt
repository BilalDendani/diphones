1776-142744-0000 WHAT THINGS ARE THERE IN THE UNIVERSE WHOSE EXISTENCE IS KNOWN TO US OWING TO OUR BEING ACQUAINTED WITH THEM SO FAR OUR ANSWER HAS BEEN THAT WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH OUR SENSE DATA AND PROBABLY WITH OURSELVES THESE WE KNOW TO EXIST
1776-142744-0001 AND PAST SENSE DATA WHICH ARE REMEMBERED ARE KNOWN TO HAVE EXISTED IN THE PAST THIS KNOWLEDGE SUPPLIES OUR DATA BUT IF WE ARE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW INFERENCES FROM THESE DATA
1776-142744-0002 IF WE ARE TO KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER OF OTHER PEOPLE OF THE PAST BEFORE OUR INDIVIDUAL MEMORY BEGINS OR OF THE FUTURE WE MUST KNOW GENERAL PRINCIPLES
1776-142744-0003 IT MUST BE KNOWN TO US THAT THE EXISTENCE OF SOME ONE SORT OF THING A IS A SIGN OF THE EXISTENCE OF SOME OTHER SORT OF THING B EITHER AT THE SAME TIME AS A OR AT SOME EARLIER OR LATER TIME AS FOR EXAMPLE
1776-142744-0004 THUNDER IS A SIGN OF THE EARLIER EXISTENCE OF LIGHTNING IF THIS WERE NOT KNOWN TO US WE COULD NEVER EXTEND OUR KNOWLEDGE BEYOND THE SPHERE OF OUR PRIVATE EXPERIENCE AND THIS SPHERE AS WE HAVE SEEN IS EXCEEDINGLY LIMITED
1776-142744-0005 THE QUESTION WE HAVE NOW TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER SUCH AN EXTENSION IS POSSIBLE AND IF SO HOW IT IS EFFECTED LET US TAKE AS AN ILLUSTRATION A MATTER ABOUT WHICH NONE OF US IN FACT FEEL THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT
1776-142744-0006 WE ARE ALL CONVINCED THAT THE SUN WILL RISE TO MORROW WHY
1776-142744-0007 TO JUSTIFY THE JUDGEMENT THAT THE SUN WILL RISE TO MORROW AND THE MANY OTHER SIMILAR JUDGEMENTS UPON WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE BASED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IF WE ARE ASKED WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THE SUN WILL RISE TO MORROW
1776-142744-0008 WE SHALL NATURALLY ANSWER BECAUSE IT ALWAYS HAS RISEN EVERY DAY WE HAVE A FIRM BELIEF
1776-142744-0009 BECAUSE IT HAS RISEN IN THE PAST IF WE ARE CHALLENGED AS TO WHY WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO RISE AS HERETOFORE WE MAY APPEAL TO THE LAWS OF MOTION THE EARTH WE SHALL SAY IS A FREELY ROTATING BODY
1776-142744-0010 AND SUCH BODIES DO NOT CEASE TO ROTATE UNLESS SOMETHING INTERFERES FROM OUTSIDE AND THERE IS NOTHING OUTSIDE TO INTERFERE WITH THE EARTH BETWEEN NOW AND TO MORROW OF COURSE IT MIGHT BE DOUBTED WHETHER WE ARE QUITE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS NOTHING OUTSIDE TO INTERFERE
1776-142744-0011 BUT THIS IS NOT THE INTERESTING DOUBT THE INTERESTING DOUBT IS AS TO WHETHER THE LAWS OF MOTION WILL REMAIN IN OPERATION UNTIL TO MORROW IF THIS DOUBT IS RAISED WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE SAME POSITION AS WHEN THE DOUBT ABOUT THE SUNRISE WAS FIRST RAISED
1776-142744-0012 IS THAT THEY HAVE OPERATED HITHERTO SO FAR AS OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST ENABLES US TO JUDGE IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE A GREATER BODY OF EVIDENCE FROM THE PAST IN FAVOUR OF THE LAWS OF MOTION THAN WE HAVE IN FAVOUR OF THE SUNRISE
1776-142744-0013 BECAUSE THE SUNRISE IS MERELY A PARTICULAR CASE OF FULFILMENT OF THE LAWS OF MOTION AND THERE ARE COUNTLESS OTHER PARTICULAR CASES BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS DO ANY NUMBER OF CASES OF A LAW BEING FULFILLED IN THE PAST AFFORD EVIDENCE THAT IT WILL BE FULFILLED IN THE FUTURE
1776-142744-0014 IF NOT IT BECOMES PLAIN THAT WE HAVE NO GROUND WHATEVER FOR EXPECTING THE SUN TO RISE TO MORROW OR FOR EXPECTING THE BREAD WE SHALL EAT AT OUR NEXT MEAL NOT TO POISON US OR FOR ANY OF THE OTHER SCARCELY CONSCIOUS EXPECTATIONS THAT CONTROL OUR DAILY LIVES
1776-142744-0015 IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT ALL SUCH EXPECTATIONS ARE ONLY PROBABLE THUS WE HAVE NOT TO SEEK FOR A PROOF THAT THEY MUST BE FULFILLED BUT ONLY FOR SOME REASON IN FAVOUR OF THE VIEW THAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE FULFILLED
1776-142744-0016 NOW IN DEALING WITH THIS QUESTION WE MUST TO BEGIN WITH MAKE AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION WITHOUT WHICH WE SHOULD SOON BECOME INVOLVED IN HOPELESS CONFUSIONS EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN US THAT HITHERTO
1776-142744-0017 THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF SOME UNIFORM SUCCESSION OR COEXISTENCE HAS BEEN A CAUSE OF OUR EXPECTING THE SAME SUCCESSION OR COEXISTENCE ON THE NEXT OCCASION
1776-142744-0018 FOOD THAT HAS A CERTAIN APPEARANCE GENERALLY HAS A CERTAIN TASTE AND IT IS A SEVERE SHOCK TO OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN THE FAMILIAR APPEARANCE IS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN UNUSUAL TASTE THINGS WHICH WE SEE BECOME ASSOCIATED BY HABIT WITH CERTAIN TACTILE SENSATIONS
1776-142744-0019 WHICH WE EXPECT IF WE TOUCH THEM ONE OF THE HORRORS OF A GHOST IN MANY GHOST STORIES IS THAT IT FAILS TO GIVE US ANY SENSATIONS OF TOUCH UNEDUCATED PEOPLE WHO GO ABROAD FOR THE FIRST TIME
1776-142744-0020 AND THIS KIND OF ASSOCIATION IS NOT CONFINED TO MEN IN ANIMALS ALSO IT IS VERY STRONG A HORSE WHICH HAS BEEN OFTEN DRIVEN ALONG A CERTAIN ROAD RESISTS THE ATTEMPT TO DRIVE HIM IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION
1776-142744-0021 DOMESTIC ANIMALS EXPECT FOOD WHEN THEY SEE THE PERSON WHO USUALLY FEEDS THEM WE KNOW THAT ALL THESE RATHER CRUDE EXPECTATIONS OF UNIFORMITY ARE LIABLE TO BE MISLEADING THE MAN WHO HAS FED THE CHICKEN EVERY DAY THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE AT LAST WRINGS ITS NECK INSTEAD
1776-142744-0022 SHOWING THAT MORE REFINED VIEWS AS TO THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL TO THE CHICKEN BUT IN SPITE OF THE MISLEADINGNESS OF SUCH EXPECTATIONS THEY NEVERTHELESS EXIST THE MERE FACT THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TIMES CAUSES ANIMALS AND MEN
1776-142744-0023 THUS OUR INSTINCTS CERTAINLY CAUSE US TO BELIEVE THAT THE SUN WILL RISE TO MORROW BUT WE MAY BE IN NO BETTER A POSITION THAN THE CHICKEN WHICH UNEXPECTEDLY HAS ITS NECK WRUNG WE HAVE THEREFORE TO DISTINGUISH THE FACT THAT PAST UNIFORMITIES CAUSE
1776-142744-0024 EXPECTATIONS AS TO THE FUTURE FROM THE QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS ANY REASONABLE GROUND FOR GIVING WEIGHT TO SUCH EXPECTATIONS AFTER THE QUESTION OF THEIR VALIDITY HAS BEEN RAISED
1776-142744-0025 THE PROBLEM WE HAVE TO DISCUSS IS WHETHER THERE IS ANY REASON FOR BELIEVING IN WHAT IS CALLED THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE THE BELIEF IN THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE IS THE BELIEF THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED OR WILL HAPPEN IS AN INSTANCE OF SOME GENERAL LAW
1776-142744-0026 TO WHICH THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS THE CRUDE EXPECTATIONS WHICH WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING ARE ALL SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS AND THEREFORE LIABLE TO DISAPPOINT THOSE WHO ENTERTAIN THEM BUT SCIENCE HABITUALLY ASSUMES
1776-142744-0027 AT LEAST AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS THAT GENERAL RULES WHICH HAVE EXCEPTIONS CAN BE REPLACED BY GENERAL RULES WHICH HAVE NO EXCEPTIONS UNSUPPORTED BODIES IN AIR FALL IS A GENERAL RULE TO WHICH BALLOONS AND AEROPLANES ARE EXCEPTIONS
1776-142744-0028 ALSO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT BALLOONS AND AEROPLANES CAN RISE
1776-142744-0029 THE BELIEF THAT THE SUN WILL RISE TO MORROW MIGHT BE FALSIFIED IF THE EARTH CAME SUDDENLY INTO CONTACT WITH A LARGE BODY WHICH DESTROYED ITS ROTATION
1776-142744-0030 THE BUSINESS OF SCIENCE IS TO FIND UNIFORMITIES
1776-142744-0031 THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS IN THIS SEARCH SCIENCE HAS BEEN REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL AND IT MAY BE CONCEDED THAT SUCH UNIFORMITIES HAVE HELD HITHERTO THIS BRINGS US BACK TO THE QUESTION HAVE WE ANY REASON
1776-142744-0032 ASSUMING THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS HELD IN THE PAST TO SUPPOSE THAT THEY WILL HOLD IN THE FUTURE IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT WE HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT THE FUTURE WILL RESEMBLE THE PAST BECAUSE WHAT WAS THE FUTURE HAS CONSTANTLY BECOME THE PAST AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOUND TO RESEMBLE THE PAST
1776-142744-0033 SO THAT WE REALLY HAVE EXPERIENCE OF THE FUTURE NAMELY OF TIMES WHICH WERE FORMERLY FUTURE WHICH WE MAY CALL PAST FUTURES BUT SUCH AN ARGUMENT REALLY BEGS THE VERY QUESTION AT ISSUE WE HAVE EXPERIENCE OF PAST FUTURES BUT NOT OF FUTURE FUTURES AND THE QUESTION IS
1776-142744-0034 WILL FUTURE FUTURES RESEMBLE PAST FUTURES THIS QUESTION IS NOT TO BE ANSWERED BY AN ARGUMENT WHICH STARTS FROM PAST FUTURES ALONE WE HAVE THEREFORE STILL TO SEEK FOR SOME PRINCIPLE WHICH SHALL ENABLE US TO KNOW THAT THE FUTURE WILL FOLLOW THE SAME LAWS AS THE PAST
1776-142744-0035 THE REFERENCE TO THE FUTURE IN THIS QUESTION IS NOT ESSENTIAL THE SAME QUESTION ARISES WHEN WE APPLY THE LAWS THAT WORK IN OUR EXPERIENCE TO PAST THINGS OF WHICH WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE AS FOR EXAMPLE IN GEOLOGY OR IN THEORIES AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
1776-142744-0036 THE QUESTION WE REALLY HAVE TO ASK IS WHEN TWO THINGS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE OFTEN ASSOCIATED
1776-142744-0037 DOES THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OF THE TWO IN A FRESH INSTANCE GIVE ANY GOOD GROUND FOR EXPECTING THE OTHER
1776-142744-0038 OF THE WHOLE OF OUR EXPECTATIONS AS TO THE FUTURE THE WHOLE OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY INDUCTION AND IN FACT PRACTICALLY ALL THE BELIEFS UPON WHICH OUR DAILY LIFE IS BASED IT MUST BE CONCEDED TO BEGIN WITH
1776-142744-0039 THAT THE FACT THAT TWO THINGS HAVE BEEN FOUND OFTEN TOGETHER AND NEVER APART DOES NOT BY ITSELF SUFFICE TO PROVE DEMONSTRATIVELY THAT THEY WILL BE FOUND TOGETHER IN THE NEXT CASE WE EXAMINE THE MOST WE CAN HOPE IS THAT THE OFTENER THINGS ARE FOUND TOGETHER
1776-142744-0040 THE MORE PROBABLE IT BECOMES THAT THEY WILL BE FOUND TOGETHER ANOTHER TIME AND THAT IF THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND TOGETHER OFTEN ENOUGH THE PROBABILITY WILL AMOUNT ALMOST TO CERTAINTY IT CAN NEVER QUITE REACH CERTAINTY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN SPITE OF FREQUENT REPETITIONS
1776-142744-0041 THERE SOMETIMES IS A FAILURE AT THE LAST AS IN THE CASE OF THE CHICKEN WHOSE NECK IS WRUNG THUS PROBABILITY IS ALL WE OUGHT TO SEEK IT MIGHT BE URGED AS AGAINST THE VIEW WE ARE ADVOCATING THAT WE KNOW ALL NATURAL PHENOMENA TO BE SUBJECT TO THE REIGN OF LAW
1776-142744-0042 AND THAT SOMETIMES ON THE BASIS OF OBSERVATION WE CAN SEE THAT ONLY ONE LAW CAN POSSIBLY FIT THE FACTS OF THE CASE NOW TO THIS VIEW THERE ARE TWO ANSWERS THE FIRST IS THAT EVEN IF SOME LAW WHICH HAS NO EXCEPTIONS APPLIES TO OUR CASE WE CAN NEVER
1776-142744-0043 IN PRACTICE BE SURE THAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT LAW AND NOT ONE TO WHICH THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS THE SECOND IS THAT THE REIGN OF LAW WOULD SEEM TO BE ITSELF ONLY PROBABLE AND THAT OUR BELIEF THAT IT WILL HOLD IN THE FUTURE OR IN UNEXAMINED CASES IN THE PAST
1776-142744-0044 IS ITSELF BASED UPON THE VERY PRINCIPLE WE ARE EXAMINING THE PRINCIPLE WE ARE EXAMINING MAY BE CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF INDUCTION AND ITS TWO PARTS MAY BE STATED AS FOLLOWS A
1776-142744-0045 WHEN A THING OF A CERTAIN SORT A HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A THING OF A CERTAIN OTHER SORT B AND HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND DISSOCIATED FROM A THING OF THE SORT B THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH A AND B HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED
1776-142744-0046 THE GREATER IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY WILL BE ASSOCIATED IN A FRESH CASE IN WHICH ONE OF THEM IS KNOWN TO BE PRESENT B UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CASES OF ASSOCIATION WILL MAKE THE PROBABILITY OF A FRESH ASSOCIATION NEARLY A CERTAINTY
1776-142744-0047 AND WILL MAKE IT APPROACH CERTAINTY WITHOUT LIMIT AS JUST STATED THE PRINCIPLE APPLIES ONLY TO THE VERIFICATION OF OUR EXPECTATION
1776-142744-0048 THAT THINGS OF THE SORT A ARE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THINGS OF THE SORT B PROVIDED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CASES OF ASSOCIATION ARE KNOWN AND NO CASES OF FAILURE OF ASSOCIATION ARE KNOWN
1776-142744-0049 THE PROBABILITY OF THE GENERAL LAW IS OBVIOUSLY LESS THAN THE PROBABILITY OF THE PARTICULAR CASE SINCE IF THE GENERAL LAW IS TRUE THE PARTICULAR CASE MUST ALSO BE TRUE WHEREAS THE PARTICULAR CASE MAY BE TRUE WITHOUT THE GENERAL LAW BEING TRUE
1776-142744-0050 NEVERTHELESS THE PROBABILITY OF THE GENERAL LAW IS INCREASED BY REPETITIONS JUST AS THE PROBABILITY OF THE PARTICULAR CASE IS WE MAY THEREFORE REPEAT THE TWO PARTS OF OUR PRINCIPLE AS REGARDS THE GENERAL LAW THUS A
1776-142744-0051 THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH A THING OF THE SORT A HAS BEEN FOUND ASSOCIATED WITH A THING OF THE SORT B THE MORE PROBABLE IT IS IF NO CASES OF FAILURE OF ASSOCIATION ARE KNOWN THAT A IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH B B
1776-142744-0052 UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CASES OF THE ASSOCIATION OF A WITH B WILL MAKE IT NEARLY CERTAIN THAT A IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH B AND WILL MAKE THIS GENERAL LAW APPROACH CERTAINTY WITHOUT LIMIT
1776-142744-0053 IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT PROBABILITY IS ALWAYS RELATIVE TO CERTAIN DATA IN OUR CASE THE DATA ARE MERELY THE KNOWN CASES OF COEXISTENCE OF A AND B THERE MAY BE OTHER DATA WHICH MIGHT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHICH WOULD GRAVELY ALTER THE PROBABILITY
1776-142744-0054 FOR EXAMPLE A MAN WHO HAD SEEN A GREAT MANY WHITE SWANS MIGHT ARGUE BY OUR PRINCIPLE THAT ON THE DATA IT WAS PROBABLE THAT ALL SWANS WERE WHITE AND THIS MIGHT BE A PERFECTLY SOUND ARGUMENT
1776-142744-0055 THAT SOME DATA RENDER IT IMPROBABLE
1776-142744-0056 IS PECULIARLY LIABLE TO ERROR BUT THIS KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE A FRESH DATUM
1776-142744-0057 THE FACT THEREFORE THAT THINGS OFTEN FAIL TO FULFIL OUR EXPECTATIONS IS NO EVIDENCE THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL NOT PROBABLY BE FULFILLED IN A GIVEN CASE OR A GIVEN CLASS OF CASES THUS OUR INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE IS AT ANY RATE
1776-142744-0058 NOT CAPABLE OF BEING DISPROVED BY AN APPEAL TO EXPERIENCE
1776-142744-0059 EXPERIENCE MIGHT CONCEIVABLY CONFIRM THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE AS REGARDS THE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY EXAMINED BUT AS REGARDS UNEXAMINED CASES IT IS THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE ALONE THAT CAN JUSTIFY ANY INFERENCE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN EXAMINED TO WHAT HAS NOT BEEN EXAMINED
1776-142744-0060 ALL ARGUMENTS WHICH ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIENCE ARGUE AS TO THE FUTURE OR THE UNEXPERIENCED PARTS OF THE PAST OR PRESENT ASSUME THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE HENCE WE CAN NEVER USE EXPERIENCE TO PROVE THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE WITHOUT BEGGING THE QUESTION
1776-142744-0061 THUS WE MUST EITHER ACCEPT THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE ON THE GROUND OF ITS INTRINSIC EVIDENCE OR FORGO ALL JUSTIFICATION OF OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE IF THE PRINCIPLE IS UNSOUND WE HAVE NO REASON TO EXPECT THE SUN TO RISE TO MORROW
1776-142744-0062 TO EXPECT BREAD TO BE MORE NOURISHING THAN A STONE OR TO EXPECT THAT IF WE THROW OURSELVES OFF THE ROOF WE SHALL FALL WHEN WE SEE WHAT LOOKS LIKE OUR BEST FRIEND APPROACHING US
1776-142744-0063 BY THE MIND OF OUR WORST ENEMY OR OF SOME TOTAL STRANGER ALL OUR CONDUCT IS BASED UPON ASSOCIATIONS WHICH HAVE WORKED IN THE PAST AND WHICH WE THEREFORE REGARD AS LIKELY TO WORK IN THE FUTURE AND THIS LIKELIHOOD IS DEPENDENT FOR ITS VALIDITY UPON THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE
1776-142744-0064 THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE SUCH AS THE BELIEF IN THE REIGN OF LAW AND THE BELIEF THAT EVERY EVENT MUST HAVE A CAUSE ARE AS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT UPON THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE AS ARE THE BELIEFS OF DAILY LIFE
1776-142744-0065 ALL SUCH GENERAL PRINCIPLES ARE BELIEVED BECAUSE MANKIND HAVE FOUND INNUMERABLE INSTANCES OF THEIR TRUTH AND NO INSTANCES OF THEIR FALSEHOOD BUT THIS AFFORDS NO EVIDENCE FOR THEIR TRUTH IN THE FUTURE UNLESS THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE IS ASSUMED
1776-142744-0066 THUS ALL KNOWLEDGE WHICH ON A BASIS OF EXPERIENCE TELLS US SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IS NOT EXPERIENCED IS BASED UPON A BELIEF WHICH EXPERIENCE CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR CONFUTE YET WHICH AT LEAST IN ITS MORE CONCRETE APPLICATIONS APPEARS TO BE AS FIRMLY ROOTED IN US AS MANY OF THE FACTS
1776-142744-0067 OF EXPERIENCE THE EXISTENCE AND JUSTIFICATION OF SUCH BELIEFS FOR THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE AS WE SHALL SEE IS NOT THE ONLY EXAMPLE RAISES SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT AND MOST DEBATED PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY
