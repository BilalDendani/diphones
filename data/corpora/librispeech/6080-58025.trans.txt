6080-58025-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE MAKING OF A PRESIDENT SELWYN NOW DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE MAKING OF ENOUGH CONSERVATIVE SENATORS TO CONTROL COMFORTABLY THAT BODY
6080-58025-0001 THE TASK WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO A MAN OF HIS SAGACITY WITH ALL THE MONEY HE COULD SPEND NEWSPAPERS WERE SUBSIDIZED IN WAYS THEY SCARCELY RECOGNIZED THEMSELVES
6080-58025-0002 HONEST OFFICIALS WHO WERE IN THE WAY WERE REMOVED BY OFFERING THEM PLACES VASTLY MORE REMUNERATIVE AND IN THIS MANNER HE BUILT UP A STRONG INTELLIGENT AND WELL CONSTRUCTED MACHINE
6080-58025-0003 IT WAS DONE SO SANELY AND SO QUIETLY THAT NO ONE SUSPECTED THE MASTER MIND BEHIND IT ALL SELWYN WAS RESPONSIBLE TO NO ONE TOOK NO ONE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE AND WAS THEREFORE IN NO DANGER OF BETRAYAL
6080-58025-0004 IT WAS A FASCINATING GAME TO SELWYN IT APPEALED TO HIS INTELLECTUAL SIDE FAR MORE THAN IT DID TO HIS AVARICE HE WANTED TO GOVERN THE NATION WITH AN ABSOLUTE HAND AND YET NOT BE KNOWN AS THE DIRECTING POWER
6080-58025-0005 HE ARRANGED TO HAVE HIS NAME APPEAR LESS FREQUENTLY IN THE PRESS AND HE NEVER SUBMITTED TO INTERVIEWS LAUGHINGLY RIDDING HIMSELF OF REPORTERS BY ASSERTING THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE
6080-58025-0006 HE HAD A SUPREME CONTEMPT FOR THE BLATANT SELF ADVERTISED POLITICIAN AND HE REMOVED HIMSELF AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THAT TYPE
6080-58025-0007 WHICH HE ORGANIZED HIMSELF THOUGH LARGELY UNDER COVER THE OPPOSITION PARTY HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL AND IT WAS A GREAT INTELLECTUAL TREAT TO SELWYN TO OVERCOME THEIR NATURAL ADVANTAGES BY THE SHEER FORCE OF ABILITY
6080-58025-0008 PLUS WHAT MONEY HE NEEDED TO CARRY OUT HIS PLANS HE PUT OUT THE CRY OF LACK OF FUNDS AND INDEED IT SEEMED TO BE TRUE FOR HE WAS TOO WISE TO MAKE A DISPLAY OF HIS RESOURCES TO WARD HEELERS
6080-58025-0009 TO THE DAILY PRESS AND TO PROFESSIONAL STUMP SPEAKERS HE GAVE SCANT COMFORT IT WAS NOT TO SUCH SOURCES THAT HE LOOKED FOR SUCCESS HE BEGAN BY ELIMINATING ALL STATES HE KNEW THE OPPOSITION PARTY WOULD CERTAINLY CARRY
6080-58025-0010 BUT HE TOLD THE PARTY LEADERS THERE TO CLAIM THAT A REVOLUTION WAS BREWING AND THAT A LANDSLIDE WOULD FOLLOW AT THE ELECTION THIS WOULD KEEP HIS ANTAGONISTS BUSY AND MAKE THEM LESS EFFECTIVE ELSEWHERE
6080-58025-0011 HE DIVIDED EACH OF THESE STATES INTO UNITS CONTAINING FIVE THOUSAND VOTERS AND AT THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS HE PLACED ONE MAN IN CHARGE OF EACH UNIT
6080-58025-0012 OF THE FIVE THOUSAND HE ROUGHLY CALCULATED THERE WOULD BE TWO THOUSAND VOTERS THAT NO KIND OF PERSUASION COULD TURN FROM HIS PARTY AND TWO THOUSAND THAT COULD NOT BE CHANGED FROM THE OPPOSITION THIS WOULD LEAVE ONE THOUSAND DOUBTFUL ONES TO WIN OVER
6080-58025-0013 SO HE HAD A CAREFUL POLL MADE IN EACH UNIT AND ELIMINATED THE STRICTLY UNPERSUADABLE PARTY MEN AND GOT DOWN TO A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE DEBATABLE ONE THOUSAND INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED AS TO THEIR RACE RELIGION
6080-58025-0014 SO THESE TWO HAD ONLY EACH OTHER TO CONSIDER AND THEIR DUTY WAS TO BRING TO ROCKLAND A MAJORITY OF THE ONE THOUSAND VOTES WITHIN THEIR CHARGE THE LOCAL MEN GAVE THE CONDITIONS THE NATIONAL MEN GAVE THE PROPER LITERATURE AND ADVICE AND THE LOCAL MAN THEN APPLIED IT
6080-58025-0015 THE OPPOSITION WAS SENDING SPEAKERS AT GREAT EXPENSE FROM ONE END OF THE COUNTRY TO THE OTHER AND THE SOUND OF THEIR VOICES RARELY FELL ON ANY BUT FRIENDLY AND SYMPATHETIC EARS
6080-58025-0016 SELWYN USED THE WEEKLY PRESS SO THAT HE COULD REACH THE FIRESIDE OF EVERY FARMER AND THE DWELLER IN THE SMALL COUNTRY TOWNS THESE WERE THE ONES THAT WOULD READ EVERY LINE IN THEIR LOCAL PAPERS AND PONDER OVER IT
6080-58025-0017 THE OPPOSITION HAD ITS CANDIDATES GOING BY SPECIAL TRAIN TO EVERY PART OF THE UNION MAKING MANY SPEECHES EVERY DAY AND MOSTLY TO VOTERS THAT COULD NOT BE DRIVEN FROM HIM EITHER BY FORCE OR PERSUASION THE LEADERS IN CITIES
6080-58025-0018 BOTH LARGE AND SMALL WOULD SECURE A DATE AND HAVING IN MIND FOR THEMSELVES A POSTMASTERSHIP OR COLLECTORSHIP WOULD TELL THEIR FOLLOWERS TO TURN OUT IN GREAT FORCE AND GIVE THE CANDIDATE A BIG OVATION
6080-58025-0019 THEY WANTED THE CANDIDATE TO REMEMBER THE ENTHUSIASM OF THESE PLACES AND TO LEAVE GREATLY PLEASED AND UNDER THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS MAKING UNTOLD CONVERTS AS A MATTER OF FACT HIS VOICE WOULD SELDOM REACH ANY BUT A STAUNCH PARTISAN
6080-58025-0020 SELWYN KEPT ROCKLAND AT HOME AND ARRANGED TO HAVE HIM MEET BY SPECIAL APPOINTMENT THE IMPORTANT CITIZENS OF THE TWELVE UNCERTAIN STATES HE WOULD HAVE THE MOST PROMINENT PARTY LEADER IN A PARTICULAR STATE
6080-58025-0021 GO TO A RICH BREWER OR LARGE MANUFACTURER WHOSE VIEWS HAD NOT YET BEEN CRYSTALLIZED AND SAY GOVERNOR ROCKLAND HAS EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO KNOW YOU AND I WOULD LIKE TO ARRANGE A MEETING
6080-58025-0022 THE MAN APPROACHED WOULD BE FLATTERED TO THINK HE WAS OF SUCH IMPORTANCE THAT A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO MEET HIM HE WOULD KNOW IT WAS HIS INFLUENCE THAT WAS WANTED BUT EVEN SO THERE WAS A SUBTLE FLATTERY IN THAT
6080-58025-0023 AN APPOINTMENT WOULD BE ARRANGED JUST BEFORE HE CAME INTO ROCKLAND'S PRESENCE HIS NAME AND A SHORT EPITOME OF HIS CAREER WOULD BE HANDED TO ROCKLAND TO READ
6080-58025-0024 WHEN HE REACHED ROCKLAND'S HOME HE WOULD AT FIRST BE DENIED ADMITTANCE HIS SPONSOR WOULD SAY THIS IS MISTER MUNTING OF MUNTINGVILLE OH PARDON ME MISTER MUNTING GOVERNOR ROCKLAND EXPECTS YOU
6080-58025-0025 AND IN THIS WAY HE IS USHERED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE GREAT HIS FAME UP TO A MOMENT AGO WAS UNKNOWN TO ROCKLAND BUT HE NOW GRASPS HIS HAND CORDIALLY AND SAYS I AM DELIGHTED TO KNOW YOU MISTER MUNTING
6080-58025-0026 I RECALL THE ADDRESS YOU MADE A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN YOU GAVE A LIBRARY TO MUNTINGVILLE IT IS MEN OF YOUR TYPE THAT HAVE MADE AMERICA WHAT IT IS TO DAY AND WHETHER YOU SUPPORT ME OR NOT
6080-58025-0027 SANE AND CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WHEN MUNTING LEAVES HE IS STEPPING ON AIR HE SEES VISIONS OF VISITS TO WASHINGTON TO CONSULT THE PRESIDENT UPON MATTERS OF STATE AND PERHAPS HE SEES AN AMBASSADORSHIP IN THE MISTY FUTURE
6080-58025-0028 THE PAY ROLL OF THE OPPOSITION WAS FILLED WITH INCOMPETENT POLITICAL HACKS THAT HAD BEEN FASTENED UPON THE MANAGEMENT BY MEN OF INFLUENCE SELWYN'S FORCE FROM END TO END
6080-58025-0029 WAS COMPOSED OF ABLE MEN WHO DID A FULL DAY'S WORK UNDER THE EYE OF THEIR WATCHFUL TASKMASTER AND SELWYN WON AND ROCKLAND BECAME THE KEYSTONE OF THE ARCH HE HAD SET OUT TO BUILD THERE FOLLOWED IN ORDERLY SUCCESSION THE INAUGURATION
6080-58025-0030 THE SELECTION OF CABINET OFFICERS AND THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WAS LAUNCHED DRUNK WITH POWER AND THE ADULATION OF SYCOPHANTS ONCE OR TWICE ROCKLAND ASSERTED HIMSELF AND ACTED UPON IMPORTANT MATTERS WITHOUT HAVING FIRST CONFERRED WITH SELWYN
6080-58025-0031 BUT AFTER HE HAD BEEN BITTERLY ASSAILED BY SELWYN'S PAPERS AND BY HIS SENATORS HE MADE NO FURTHER ATTEMPTS AT INDEPENDENCE HE FELT THAT HE WAS UTTERLY HELPLESS IN THAT STRONG MAN'S HANDS AND SO INDEED HE WAS
6080-58025-0032 ONE OF THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES DIED TWO RETIRED BECAUSE OF AGE AND ALL WERE REPLACED BY MEN SUGGESTED BY SELWYN HE NOW HAD THE SENATE THE EXECUTIVE AND A MAJORITY OF THE COURT OF LAST RESORT
6080-58025-0033 THAT WHEN HIS POWER WAS GREATEST IT WAS MOST INSECURE HE DID NOT KNOW COULD NOT KNOW WHAT FORCE WAS WORKING TO HIS RUIN AND TO THE RUIN OF HIS SYSTEM TAKE HEART THEREFORE
6080-58025-0034 YOU WHO HAD LOST FAITH IN THE ULTIMATE DESTINY OF THE REPUBLIC FOR A GREATER THAN SELWYN IS HERE TO ESPOUSE YOUR CAUSE
