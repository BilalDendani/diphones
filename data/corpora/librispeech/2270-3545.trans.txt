2270-3545-0000 THE YEARS PASSED SWIFTLY WITHOUT BRINGING ANY GREAT CHANGES IN OUR QUIET LIFE OUR GRANDPARENTS HAD AGED A BIT AND TERESA WAS NOT QUITE AS ACTIVE AS FORMERLY WHILE A FEW WRINKLES HAD GATHERED ON OUR FATHER'S FOREHEAD BUT ALL THIS HAD COME SO SLOWLY THAT THE CHANGE WAS HARDLY NOTICED
2270-3545-0001 ROSA WHO WAS NOW EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WAS STUDYING IN THE CITY SHE WAS STILL THE SAME STUDIOUS FAITHFUL AND SINCERE IN ALL THAT SHE DID HER QUIET RESERVED MANNER CAUSED SOME PEOPLE TO CALL HER PROUD BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HER BETTER LOVED HER AND KNEW SHE COULD BE DEPENDED ON IN TIME OF TROUBLE
2270-3545-0002 CATALINA STILL SUFFERED SOMEWHAT BUT NOW WAS ABLE TO WALK AROUND A BIT WITHOUT CRUTCHES AND IN SPITE OF HER DELICATE HEALTH AND POOR TWISTED BODY SHE HAD COME BRAVELY TO TAKE HER TRUE PLACE AMONG US AS OUR BIG SISTER SO LOVING AND SOLICITOUS FOR EVERYBODY'S WELFARE
2270-3545-0003 PAULA WAS NOW FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE
2270-3545-0004 OUR JOYS WERE HERS OUR SORROWS WERE HER SORROWS SHE HAD GROWN IN BODY AND MIND AND YET HAD KEPT THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS ALWAYS BRIGHT AND HAPPY AND FULL OF FUN SHE HAD THE SAME SIMPLE HUMBLE WAYS AS WHEN AT TEN YEARS OF AGE SHE HAD COME AMONG US
2270-3545-0005 HER SPECIAL SUMMER DELIGHT WAS TO RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS ALWAYS RETURNING TO THE HOUSE WITH A BIG BUNCH OF WILD FLOWERS FOR CATALINA IN ONE THING ONLY SHE ALWAYS SEEMED TO FAIL TERESA HAD A FEARFUL TASK IN TEACHING HER TO SEW AND TO KNIT
2270-3545-0006 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN THE FUTURE IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW PAULA WOULD SAY SADLY AND WOULD TAKE UP THE WORK ONCE MORE WITH SUCH SWEET RESIGNATION THAT TERESA MOVED WITH COMPASSION
2270-3545-0007 THEN AWAY PAULA WOULD GO INTO THE GARDEN OR UNDER THE TREES THAT LINED THE VILLAGE STREET SOON SHE WAS BACK WITH SUCH A HAPPY SMILE THAT TERESA FORGAVE HER COMPLETELY ONCE HOWEVER TERESA LOST ALL PATIENCE WITH HER EXCLAIMING
2270-3545-0008 DROP THAT WORK AND GO WHERE YOU PLEASE BUT REMEMBER THIS NEVER WILL YOU BE CALLED A DORCAS NEVER WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SEW AND PROVIDE GARMENTS FOR THE POOR IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM YOU MUST SHOW IT BY YOUR WORKS AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO LEARN TO BE USEFUL TO THEM
2270-3545-0009 PAULA SAT BACK STIFF AND STRAIGHT IN CONSTERNATION
2270-3545-0010 OH PLEASE LET ME GO ON I WILL TRY TO DO BETTER BUT TERESA HAD TAKEN AWAY THE WORK AND WAS NOT INCLINED TO BE EASILY PERSUADED NO NOT NOW
2270-3545-0011 PAULA THEREFORE HAD TO SUBMIT BUT THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT TERESA HAD ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN THAT AFTERNOON PAULA HAD GONE STRAIGHT TO HER ROOM AND I FOLLOWED SOON AFTER TO COMFORT HER BUT I FOUND HER KNEELING BY HER BEDSIDE
2270-3545-0012 I CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND ME AND STOLE AWAY LATER PAULA SAID TO ME OH LISITA I'M SURELY BAD INDEED ONE THING I'VE CERTAINLY HATED TO DO AND THAT IS TO SIT DOWN AND LEARN TO SEW ESPECIALLY IN FINE WEATHER LIKE THIS
2270-3545-0013 I SEEM TO HEAR A THOUSAND VOICES THAT CALL ME OUT OF DOORS I NEVER COULD SEE ANY EARTHLY REASON WHY I SHOULD HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SEW AND SO I NEVER EVEN TRIED TO PLEASE TERESA IN THAT WAY BUT NOW SHE TELLS ME THAT IF I GO ON LIKE THIS
2270-3545-0014 I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEW FOR THE POOR I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT I WONDER WHAT THE LORD JESUS MUST THINK OF ME HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR ME AND HERE I AM NOT WILLING TO LEARN SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP ME TO PUT CLOTHES ON POOR FOLKS OH I MUST I MUST LEARN TO SEW NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS
2270-3545-0015 THAT WAS IT TO DO SOMETHING FOR OTHERS THAT WAS THE PRINCIPAL THING IN ALL HER THOUGHTS IN SCHOOL PAULA NEVER DID WIN PRIZES NOR DID I BOTH OF US WERE GENERALLY ABOUT ON AN EQUAL LEVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR CLASS
2270-3545-0016 TERESA MADE A MAGNIFICENT APPLE CAKE AS A SIGN OF HER PLEASURE MY FATHER ALSO SHOWED HIS GREAT SATISFACTION AND IN FACT EVERYBODY REJOICED TO SEE THAT AT LAST WE WERE BOTH MAKING PROGRESS IN SPITE OF ALL HOWEVER THERE WAS ONE GREAT HEAVY WEIGHT ON MY HEART
2270-3545-0017 AND I CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT
2270-3545-0018 BUT SHE MADE US PROMISE TO COME AND VISIT HER YOU ARE NO LONGER MY PUPILS SHE SAID BUT YOU ARE STILL AND WILL BE ALWAYS MY DEAR FRIENDS GABRIEL WAS SO GLAD TO SEE US THAT IT WAS ALWAYS A JOY TO GO AND PLAY WITH HIM ON OUR THURSDAY HALF HOLIDAYS
2270-3545-0019 PAULA ALWAYS TOLD HIM BIBLE STORIES FOR THAT SEEMED TO BE HIS CHIEF PLEASURE AND I TAUGHT HIM TO READ
2270-3545-0020 IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE MY VICTORIA IN SCHOOL SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME AS WISE AND LEARNED AS YOU MESDEMOISELLES SHE WOULD SAY A BIT SADLY AT TIMES BUT THERE I CAN'T COMPLAIN
2270-3545-0021 ONE AFTERNOON WE SAID GOOD BYE TO GABRIEL AND MOUNTED THE STAIRS TO VISIT THE BLIND GIRL LEFT ALONE FOR MOST OF THE DAY SHE PASSED THE LONG HOURS KNITTING SHE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS OUR CATALINA BUT SHE APPEARED TO BE MUCH OLDER
2270-3545-0022 THE FIRST TIME WE HAD VISITED HER SHE HAD HARDLY RAISED HER HEAD FROM HER WORK AND SHOWED BUT LITTLE INTEREST IN THE STORIES THAT HER MOTHER HAD ASKED US TO READ TO HER IT WAS NOT SO MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS AN APPARENT INCAPACITY TO COMPREHEND THE MEANING OF WHAT SHE HEARD
2270-3545-0023 BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR AFTERNOON PAULA STARTED SINGING A HYMN
2270-3545-0024 WHEN PAULA HAD FINISHED SHE EXCLAIMED OH MAMMA MAMMA TELL HER TO PLEASE SING AGAIN
2270-3545-0025 AND SO PAULA SANG HYMN AFTER HYMN AS PAULA AT LAST STOPPED SINGING FOR THE TIME HAD COME TO GO HOME POOR MARGUERITE STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS AS IF GROPING FOR SOMETHING PLEASE DO NOT BE OFFENDED MADEMOISELLE PAULA IMPLORED MADAME BERTIN
2270-3545-0026 SHE WANTS YOU TO COME NEARER THAT SHE MAY FEEL YOUR FACE THE BLIND HAVE NO OTHER EYES PAULA KNEELED AT MARGUERITE'S SIDE AND THE BLIND GIRL PASSED HER HANDS GENTLY OVER THE UPTURNED FACE
2270-3545-0027 THAT SMILED SOFTLY AS SHE TOUCHED THEM YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HER HAIR SAID THE MOTHER AS SHE GUIDED THE GIRL'S HANDS UPWARD AND OVER THE WAVES OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR THAT SEEMED LIKE AN AURORA FIT FOR SUCH A FACE AND THEN FINALLY DOWN THE LONG BRAIDS THAT EXTENDED BELOW PAULA'S WAIST
2270-3545-0028 THEN WITH ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN MOVEMENTS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BLIND
2270-3545-0029 THEN JUST AS SUDDENLY
2270-3545-0030 AT THIS PAULA SPRANG TO HER FEET AND PUT HER ARMS ABOUT THE POOR GIRL AND MURMURED IN HER EAR WE DO LOVE YOU SO MARGUERITE
2270-3545-0031 HER INDIFFERENCE AND SADNESS DISAPPEARED GIVING PLACE TO A QUIET PEACE AND JOY THAT WAS CONTAGIOUS FOR ALL WHO CAME IN CONTACT WITH HER
2270-3545-0032 ONLY MY MARGUERITE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS SHE BECAME OUR CONSTANT DELIGHT
2270-3545-0033 WHICH GAVE US ALMOST AS MUCH JOY AS WE CARRIED THEM TO MARGUERITE AS SHE HERSELF FELT ON RECEIVING THEM ONE DAY GABRIEL CAME RUNNING TO TELL US THAT MARGUERITE WAS QUITE ILL AND WE LOST NO TIME IN GOING TO SEE HER
2270-3545-0034 AS SHE SLIGHTLY RAISED THE SICK GIRL'S HEAD DEAREST MARGUERITE SAID OUR TEACHER HERE ARE PAULA AND LISITA
2270-3545-0035 AND MARGUERITE SPREAD OUT HER AMS TOWARD US ADDING OH PAULA PLEASE SING AGAIN
2270-3545-0036 DON'T CRY MOTHER SHE SAID AS SHE CAUGHT A LOW SOB FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
2270-3545-0037 ONE REGRET ONLY I HAVE MAMMA MARGUERITE SAID AND THAT IS THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOUR FACE OH THAT I MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT JUST ONCE IN HEAVEN INTERRUPTED OUR TEACHER YOUR EYES WILL BE OPEN FOREVER
2270-3545-0038 OH YES SAID THE DYING GIRL
2270-3545-0039 THEN SUDDENLY PAULA SHE CALLED PAULA HERE I AM MARGUERITE AND PAULA CAME CLOSER TAKING HER HAND AH YOU ARE HERE THANKS DEAR PAULA SHE GASPED
2270-3545-0040 MANY THANKS FOR TELLING ME ABOUT JESUS AND HIS LOVE FOR ME SING THE SENTENCE WAS NEVER FINISHED BUT PAULA'S SWEET VOICE ROSE AS ONCE AGAIN SHE SANG THE SUBLIME WORDS
