6352-88007-0000 THE REIGN OF THIS PRINCE AS THOSE OF HIS PREDECESSORS WAS DISTURBED BY THE REBELLIONS AND INCURSIONS OF THE NORTHUMBRIAN DANES WHO THOUGH FREQUENTLY QUELLED WERE NEVER ENTIRELY SUBDUED NOR HAD EVER PAID A SINCERE ALLEGIANCE TO THE CROWN OF ENGLAND
6352-88007-0001 THE ACCESSION OF A NEW KING SEEMED TO THEM A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR SHAKING OFF THE YOKE BUT ON EDRED'S APPEARANCE WITH AN ARMY THEY MADE HIM THEIR WONTED SUBMISSIONS AND THE KING HAVING WASTED THE COUNTRY WITH FIRE AND SWORD AS A PUNISHMENT OF THEIR REBELLION
6352-88007-0002 OBLIGED THEM TO RENEW THEIR OATHS OF ALLEGIANCE AND HE STRAIGHT RETIRED WITH HIS FORCES THE OBEDIENCE OF THE DANES LASTED NO LONGER THAN THE PRESENT TERROR
6352-88007-0003 THEY BROKE INTO A NEW REBELLION AND WERE AGAIN SUBDUED BUT THE KING NOW INSTRUCTED BY EXPERIENCE TOOK GREATER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THEIR FUTURE REVOLT HE FIXED ENGLISH GARRISONS IN THEIR MOST CONSIDERABLE TOWNS AND PLACED OVER THEM AN ENGLISH GOVERNOR WHO MIGHT WATCH ALL THEIR MOTIONS
6352-88007-0004 AND SUPPRESS ANY INSURRECTION ON ITS FIRST APPEARANCE HE OBLIGED ALSO MALCOLM KING OF SCOTLAND TO RENEW HIS HOMAGE FOR THE LANDS WHICH HE HELD IN ENGLAND EDRED THOUGH NOT UNWARLIKE NOR UNFIT FOR ACTIVE LIFE LAY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOWEST SUPERSTITION
6352-88007-0005 AND HAD BLINDLY DELIVERED OVER HIS CONSCIENCE TO THE GUIDANCE OF DUNSTAN COMMONLY CALLED SAINT DUNSTAN ABBOT OF GLASTONBURY WHOM HE ADVANCED TO THE HIGHEST OFFICES AND WHO COVERED UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF SANCTITY THE MOST VIOLENT AND MOST INSOLENT AMBITION
6352-88007-0006 TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM BY THE KING THIS CHURCHMAN IMPORTED INTO ENGLAND A NEW ORDER OF MONKS WHO MUCH CHANGED THE STATE OF ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS AND EXCITED ON THEIR FIRST ESTABLISHMENT THE MOST VIOLENT COMMOTIONS
6352-88007-0007 FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF CHRISTIANITY AMONG THE SAXONS THERE HAD BEEN MONASTERIES IN ENGLAND AND THESE ESTABLISHMENTS HAD EXTREMELY MULTIPLIED BY THE DONATIONS OF THE PRINCES AND NOBLES WHOSE SUPERSTITION DERIVED FROM THEIR IGNORANCE AND PRECARIOUS LIFE
6352-88007-0008 AND INCREASED BY REMORSES FOR THE CRIMES INTO WHICH THEY WERE SO FREQUENTLY BETRAYED KNEW NO OTHER EXPEDIENT FOR APPEASING THE DEITY THAN A PROFUSE LIBERALITY TOWARDS THE ECCLESIASTICS BUT THE MONKS HAD HITHERTO BEEN A SPECIES OF SECULAR PRIESTS
6352-88007-0009 WHO LIVED AFTER THE MANNER OF THE PRESENT CANONS OR PREBENDARIES AND WERE BOTH INTERMINGLED IN SOME DEGREE WITH THE WORLD
6352-88007-0010 WERE GREEDILY EMBRACED AND PROMOTED BY THE POLICY OF THE COURT OF ROME THE ROMAN PONTIFF WHO WAS MAKING EVERY DAY GREAT ADVANCES TOWARDS AN ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ECCLESIASTICS PERCEIVED THAT THE CELIBACY OF THE CLERGY ALONE
6352-88007-0011 COULD BREAK OFF ENTIRELY THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE CIVIL POWER AND DEPRIVING THEM OF EVERY OTHER OBJECT OF AMBITION ENGAGE THEM TO PROMOTE WITH UNCEASING INDUSTRY THE GRANDEUR OF THEIR OWN ORDER HE WAS SENSIBLE THAT SO LONG AS THE MONKS WERE INDULGED IN MARRIAGE AND WERE PERMITTED TO REAR FAMILIES
6352-88007-0012 A READY AND ZEALOUS OBEDIENCE CELIBACY THEREFORE BEGAN TO BE EXTOLLED AS THE INDISPENSABLE DUTY OF PRIESTS AND THE POPE UNDERTOOK TO MAKE ALL THE CLERGY THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN WORLD RENOUNCE AT ONCE THE PRIVILEGE OF MARRIAGE A FORTUNATE POLICY
6352-88007-0013 BUT AT THE SAME TIME AN UNDERTAKING THE MOST DIFFICULT OF ANY SINCE HE HAD THE STRONGEST PROPENSITIES OF HUMAN NATURE TO ENCOUNTER AND FOUND THAT THE SAME CONNECTIONS WITH THE FEMALE SEX WHICH GENERALLY ENCOURAGE DEVOTION WERE HERE UNFAVORABLE TO THE SUCCESS OF HIS PROJECT
6352-88007-0014 IT IS NO WONDER THEREFORE THAT THIS MASTER STROKE OF ART SHOULD HAVE MET WITH VIOLENT CONTRADICTION AND THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE HIERARCHY AND THE INCLINATIONS OF THE PRIESTS BEING NOW PLACED IN THIS SINGULAR OPPOSITION
6352-88007-0015 SHOULD NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONTINUED EFFORTS OF ROME HAVE RETARDED THE EXECUTION OF THAT BOLD SCHEME DURING THE COURSE OF NEAR THREE CENTURIES DUNSTAN WAS BORN OF NOBLE PARENTS IN THE WEST OF ENGLAND AND BEING EDUCATED UNDER HIS UNCLE ALDHELM
6352-88007-0016 THEN ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF TO THE ECCLESIASTICAL LIFE AND HAD ACQUIRED SOME CHARACTER IN THE COURT OF EDMUND HE WAS HOWEVER REPRESENTED TO THAT PRINCE AS A MAN OF LICENTIOUS MANNERS AND FINDING HIS FORTUNE BLASTED BY THESE SUSPICIONS
6352-88007-0017 HIS ARDENT AMBITION PROMPTED HIM TO REPAIR HIS INDISCRETIONS BY RUNNING INTO AN OPPOSITE EXTREME HE SECLUDED HIMSELF ENTIRELY FROM THE WORLD HE FRAMED A CELL SO SMALL THAT HE COULD NEITHER STAND ERECT IN IT NOR STRETCH OUT HIS LIMBS DURING HIS REPOSE
6352-88007-0018 EITHER IN DEVOTION OR IN MANUAL LABOR IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS BRAIN BECAME GRADUALLY CRAZED BY THESE SOLITARY OCCUPATIONS AND THAT HIS HEAD WAS FILLED WITH CHIMERAS WHICH BEING BELIEVED BY HIMSELF AND HIS STUPID VOTARIES
6352-88007-0019 PROCURED HIM THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF SANCTITY AMONG THE PEOPLE HE FANCIED THAT THE DEVIL AMONG THE FREQUENT VISITS WHICH HE PAID HIM WAS ONE DAY MORE EARNEST THAN USUAL IN HIS TEMPTATIONS TILL DUNSTAN PROVOKED AT HIS IMPORTUNITY
6352-88007-0020 SEIZED HIM BY THE NOSE WITH A PAIR OF RED HOT PINCERS AS HE PUT HIS HEAD INTO THE CELL AND HE HELD HIM THERE TILL THAT MALIGNANT SPIRIT MADE THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD RESOUND WITH HIS BELLOWINGS
6352-88007-0021 AND BEING THUS POSSESSED BOTH OF POWER AT COURT AND OF CREDIT WITH THE POPULACE HE WAS ENABLED TO ATTEMPT WITH SUCCESS THE MOST ARDUOUS ENTERPRISES FINDING THAT HIS ADVANCEMENT HAD BEEN OWING TO THE OPINION OF HIS AUSTERITY
6352-88007-0022 HE PROFESSED HIMSELF A PARTISAN OF THE RIGID MONASTIC RULES AND AFTER INTRODUCING THAT REFORMATION INTO THE CONVENTS OF GLASTONBURY AND ABINGDON HE ENDEAVORED TO RENDER IT UNIVERSAL IN THE KINGDOM THE MINDS OF MEN WERE ALREADY WELL PREPARED FOR THIS INNOVATION
6352-88007-0023 THE PRAISES OF AN INVIOLABLE CHASTITY HAD BEEN CARRIED TO THE HIGHEST EXTRAVAGANCE BY SOME OF THE FIRST PREACHERS OF CHRISTIANITY AMONG THE SAXONS THE PLEASURES OF LOVE HAD BEEN REPRESENTED AS INCOMPATIBLE WITH CHRISTIAN PERFECTION
6352-88007-0024 AND A TOTAL ABSTINENCE FROM ALL COMMERCE WITH THE SEX WAS DEEMED SUCH A MERITORIOUS PENANCE
6352-88007-0025 THEY INVEIGHED BITTERLY AGAINST THE VICES AND PRETENDED LUXURY OF THE AGE THEY WERE PARTICULARLY VEHEMENT AGAINST THE DISSOLUTE LIVES OF THE SECULAR CLERGY THEIR RIVALS EVERY INSTANCE OF LIBERTINISM IN ANY INDIVIDUAL OF THAT ORDER WAS REPRESENTED AS A GENERAL CORRUPTION
6352-88007-0026 AND WHERE OTHER TOPICS OF DEFAMATION WERE WANTING THEIR MARRIAGE BECAME A SURE SUBJECT OF INVECTIVE AND THEIR WIVES RECEIVED THE NAME OF CONCUBINE OR OTHER MORE OPPROBRIOUS APPELLATION
6352-88007-0027 DEFENDED THEMSELVES WITH VIGOR AND ENDEAVORED TO RETALIATE UPON THEIR ADVERSARIES THE PEOPLE WERE THROWN INTO AGITATION
6352-88007-0028 EXCITED BY THE MOST MATERIAL DIFFERENCES IN RELIGION OR RATHER BY THE MOST FRIVOLOUS SINCE IT IS A JUST REMARK THAT THE MORE AFFINITY THERE IS BETWEEN THEOLOGICAL PARTIES
6352-88007-0029 HIS NOBILITY WERE ASSEMBLED IN A GREAT HALL AND WERE INDULGING THEMSELVES IN THAT RIOT AND DISORDER WHICH FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THEIR GERMAN ANCESTORS HAD BECOME HABITUAL TO THE ENGLISH WHEN EDWY ATTRACTED BY SOFTER PLEASURES RETIRED INTO THE QUEEN'S APARTMENT
6352-88007-0030 AND IN THAT PRIVACY GAVE REINS TO HIS FONDNESS TOWARDS HIS WIFE WHICH WAS ONLY MODERATELY CHECKED BY THE PRESENCE OF HER MOTHER DUNSTAN CONJECTURED THE REASON OF THE KING'S RETREAT AND CARRYING ALONG WITH HIM ODO ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
6352-88007-0031 OVER WHOM HE HAD GAINED AN ABSOLUTE ASCENDANT HE BURST INTO THE APARTMENT
6352-88007-0032 PROBABLY BESTOWED ON THE QUEEN THE MOST OPPROBRIOUS EPITHET THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO HER SEX AND TEARING HIM FROM HER ARMS PUSHED HIM BACK IN A DISGRACEFUL MANNER INTO THE BANQUET OF THE NOBLES
6352-88007-0033 FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING REVENGE FOR THIS PUBLIC INSULT HE QUESTIONED DUNSTAN CONCERNING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TREASURY DURING THE REIGN OF HIS PREDECESSOR AND WHEN THAT MINISTER REFUSED TO GIVE ANY ACCOUNT OF MONEY EXPENDED AS HE AFFIRMED BY ORDERS OF THE LATE KING
6352-88007-0034 HE ACCUSED HIM OF MALVERSATION IN HIS OFFICE AND BANISHED HIM THE KINGDOM BUT DUNSTAN'S CABAL WAS NOT INACTIVE DURING HIS ABSENCE THEY FILLED THE PUBLIC WITH HIGH PANEGYRICS ON HIS SANCTITY THEY EXCLAIMED AGAINST THE IMPIETY OF THE KING AND QUEEN
6352-88007-0035 AND HAVING POISONED THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE BY THESE DECLAMATIONS THEY PROCEEDED TO STILL MORE OUTRAGEOUS ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE ROYAL AUTHORITY ARCHBISHOP ODO SENT INTO THE PALACE A PARTY OF SOLDIERS WHO SEIZED THE QUEEN AND HAVING BURNED HER FACE WITH A ROD HOT IRON
6352-88007-0036 THEY CARRIED HER BY FORCE INTO IRELAND THERE TO REMAIN IN PERPETUAL EXILE
6352-88007-0037 WAS OBLIGED TO CONSENT TO HIS DIVORCE WHICH WAS PRONOUNCED BY ODO AND A CATASTROPHE STILL MORE DISMAL AWAITED THE UNHAPPY ELGIVA THAT AMIABLE PRINCESS BEING CURED OF HER WOUNDS AND HAVING EVEN OBLITERATED THE SCARS WITH WHICH ODO HAD HOPED TO DEFACE HER BEAUTY
6352-88007-0038 RETURNED INTO ENGLAND AND WAS FLYING TO THE EMBRACES OF THE KING WHOM SHE STILL REGARDED AS HER HUSBAND WHEN SHE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF A PARTY WHOM THE PRIMATE HAD SENT TO INTERCEPT HER NOTHING BUT HER DEATH COULD NOW GIVE SECURITY TO ODO AND THE MONKS
6352-88007-0039 DUNSTAN RETURNED INTO ENGLAND AND TOOK UPON HIM THE GOVERNMENT OF EDGAR AND HIS PARTY HE WAS FIRST INSTALLED IN THE SEE OF WORCESTER THEN IN THAT OF LONDON AND ON ODO'S DEATH AND THE VIOLENT EXPULSION OF BRITHELM HIS SUCCESSOR IN THAT OF CANTERBURY
6352-88007-0040 OF ALL WHICH HE LONG KEPT POSSESSION ODO IS TRANSMITTED TO US BY THE MONKS UNDER THE CHARACTER OF A MAN OF PIETY DUNSTAN WAS EVEN CANONIZED AND IS ONE OF THOSE NUMEROUS SAINTS OF THE SAME STAMP WHO DISGRACE THE ROMISH CALENDAR
