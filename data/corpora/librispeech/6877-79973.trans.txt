6877-79973-0000 THERE WAS ONCE A MERRY YOUNG HUNTSMAN WHO WENT INTO THE FOREST TO HUNT HE WAS GAY AND LIGHT HEARTED AND WHISTLED A TUNE UPON A LEAF AS HE WENT ALONG SUDDENLY AN UGLY OLD CRONE SPOKE TO HIM AND SAID
6877-79973-0001 GOOD MORNING DEAR HUNTSMAN YOU ARE MERRY AND HAPPY ENOUGH WHILE I AM HUNGRY AND THIRSTY PRAY GIVE ME AN ALMS THE HUNTSMAN PITIED THE POOR OLD WOMAN
6877-79973-0002 PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND MADE HER A PRESENT ACCORDING TO HIS MEANS THEN HE WANTED TO GO ON BUT THE OLD WOMAN HELD HIM BACK AND SAID HARK YE DEAR HUNTSMAN I WILL MAKE YOU A PRESENT BECAUSE OF YOUR GOOD HEART
6877-79973-0003 GO ON YOUR WAY AND YOU WILL COME TO A TREE ON WHICH NINE BIRDS ARE SITTING THEY WILL HAVE A CLOAK IN THEIR CLAWS OVER WHICH THEY ARE FIGHTING TAKE AIM WITH YOUR GUN AND SHOOT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEM THEY WILL DROP THE CLOAK
6877-79973-0004 AND ONE OF THE BIRDS WILL FALL DOWN DEAD TAKE THE CLOAK WITH YOU IT IS A WISHING CLOAK WHEN YOU THROW IT ROUND YOUR SHOULDERS YOU ONLY HAVE TO WISH YOURSELF AT A PLACE TO BE THERE AT ONCE
6877-79973-0005 THE HUNTSMAN THANKED THE WISE WOMAN AND THOUGHT SHE PROMISES FINE THINGS IF ONLY THEY TURN OUT AS WELL WHEN HE HAD GONE ABOUT A HUNDRED PACES HE HEARD ABOVE HIM IN THE BRANCHES OF A TREE
6877-79973-0006 THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY IT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE OLD WOMAN SAID HE PUT HIS GUN TO HIS SHOULDER TOOK AIM AND FIRED RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEM MAKING THE FEATHERS FLY ABOUT THE BIRDS TOOK FLIGHT WITH A GREAT NOISE
6877-79973-0007 ALL EXCEPT ONE WHICH FELL DOWN DEAD AND THE CLOAK DROPPED AT HIS FEET HE DID AS THE OLD WOMAN HAD TOLD HIM
6877-79973-0008 AND THE NEXT MORNING HE FOUND ANOTHER AND THE SAME EVERY MORNING WHEN HE GOT UP HE COLLECTED QUITE A HEAP OF GOLD AND AT LAST HE THOUGHT WHAT IS THE GOOD OF ALL MY GOLD IF I STAY AT HOME HERE
6877-79973-0009 IT WILL SUIT US BETTER THAN HIM HE HAS A BIRD'S HEART ABOUT HIM
6877-79973-0010 SHE TOLD THE GIRL HOW HE HAD GOT IT AND AT LAST SAID IF YOU DON'T GET IT FROM HIM IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU WHEN THE HUNTSMAN GOT NEARER HE SAW THE MAIDEN AND SAID
6877-79973-0011 I HAVE BEEN WANDERING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME I WILL GO INTO THIS CASTLE AND TAKE A REST I HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY BUT THE REAL REASON WAS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PRETTY PICTURE AT THE WINDOW
6877-79973-0012 HE WENT IN AND HE WAS KINDLY RECEIVED AND HOSPITABLY TREATED BEFORE LONG HE WAS SO ENAMOURED OF THE WITCH MAIDEN THAT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE AND CARED FOR NOTHING BUT PLEASING HER THE OLD WOMAN SAID TO THE MAIDEN
6877-79973-0013 NOW WE MUST GET THE BIRD'S HEART HE WILL NEVER MISS IT THEY CONCOCTED A POTION AND WHEN IT WAS READY THEY PUT IT INTO A GOBLET AND THE MAIDEN TOOK IT TO HIM AND SAID NOW MY BELOVED YOU MUST DRINK TO ME
6877-79973-0014 HE TOOK THE CUP AND DRANK THE POTION AND WHEN HE WAS OVERPOWERED BY IT THE BIRD'S HEART CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH THE MAIDEN TOOK IT AWAY SECRETLY AND SWALLOWED IT HERSELF FOR THE OLD WOMAN WANTED TO HAVE IT
6877-79973-0015 FROM THIS TIME THE HUNTSMAN FOUND NO MORE GOLD UNDER HIS PILLOW BUT THE COIN WAS ALWAYS UNDER THE MAIDEN'S INSTEAD AND THE OLD WOMAN USED TO FETCH IT AWAY EVERY MORNING
6877-79973-0016 BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IN LOVE THAT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT ENJOYING HIMSELF IN THE MAIDEN'S COMPANY THEN THE OLD WOMAN SAID WE HAVE GOT THE BIRD'S HEART BUT WE MUST HAVE HIS WISHING CLOAK TOO
6877-79973-0017 THE MAIDEN SAID LET US LEAVE HIM THAT WE HAVE TAKEN AWAY HIS WEALTH THE OLD WOMAN WAS VERY ANGRY AND SAID A CLOAK LIKE THAT IS A VERY WONDERFUL THING AND NOT OFTEN TO BE GOT
6877-79973-0018 OVER THERE ARE THE GARNET MOUNTAINS WHERE THE PRECIOUS STONES ARE FOUND I LONG FOR THEM SO MUCH THAT I GROW SAD WHENEVER I THINK OF THEM BUT WHO COULD EVER GET THEM THE BIRDS WHICH FLY PERHAPS NO MORTAL COULD EVER REACH THEM
6877-79973-0019 IF THAT IS ALL YOUR TROUBLE SAID THE HUNTSMAN I CAN SOON LIFT THAT LOAD FROM YOUR HEART THEN HE DREW HER UNDER HIS CLOAK AND IN A MOMENT THEY WERE BOTH SITTING ON THE MOUNTAIN THE PRECIOUS STONES WERE GLITTERING AROUND THEM
6877-79973-0020 THEIR HEARTS REJOICED AT THE SIGHT OF THEM AND THEY SOON GATHERED TOGETHER SOME OF THE FINEST AND LARGEST NOW THE WITCH HAD SO MANAGED THAT THE HUNTSMAN BEGAN TO FEEL HIS EYES GROW VERY HEAVY SO HE SAID TO THE MAIDEN
6877-79973-0021 WHEN THE HUNTSMAN HAD HAD HIS SLEEP OUT HE WOKE UP AND SAW THAT HIS BELOVED HAD BETRAYED HIM AND LEFT HIM ALONE ON THE WILD MOUNTAIN OH WHAT TREACHERY THERE IS IN THE WORLD HE EXCLAIMED
6877-79973-0022 HE QUICKLY LAY DOWN AGAIN AND PRETENDED TO BE FAST ASLEEP THE FIRST ONE AS HE CAME ALONG STUMBLED AGAINST HIM AND SAID
6877-79973-0023 THE SECOND SAID TREAD ON HIM AND KILL HIM BUT THE THIRD SAID IT ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
6877-79973-0024 GOT UP AND CLIMBED UP TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AFTER HE HAD SAT THERE FOR A TIME A CLOUD FLOATED OVER HIM AND CARRIED HIM AWAY AT FIRST HE WAS SWEPT THROUGH THE AIR
6877-79973-0025 BUT THEN HE WAS GENTLY LOWERED AND DEPOSITED WITHIN A LARGE WALLED GARDEN UPON A SOFT BED OF LETTUCES AND OTHER HERBS HE LOOKED AROUND HIM AND SAID IF ONLY I HAD SOMETHING TO EAT I AM SO HUNGRY
6877-79973-0026 AND IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO GET AWAY FROM HERE I SEE NEITHER APPLES NOR PEARS NOR ANY OTHER FRUIT NOTHING BUT SALAD AND HERBS AT LAST HOWEVER HE THOUGHT AT THE WORST I CAN EAT SOME OF THIS SALAD
6877-79973-0027 HE PICKED OUT A FINE HEAD OF LETTUCE AND BEGAN EATING IT BUT HE HAD HARDLY SWALLOWED A LITTLE PIECE WHEN HE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY ODD AND QUITE CHANGED HE FELT FOUR LEGS GROWING A BIG HEAD
6877-79973-0028 HE WENT ON EATING GREEDILY AT LAST HE REACHED ANOTHER KIND OF SALAD WHICH HE HAD HARDLY TASTED WHEN HE FELT A NEW CHANGE TAKING PLACE AND FOUND HIMSELF BACK IN HIS HUMAN SHAPE AFTER THIS HE LAY DOWN AND SLEPT OFF HIS FATIGUE
6877-79973-0029 AND THOUGHT THESE WILL HELP ME TO REGAIN MY OWN AND ALSO TO PUNISH THE TRAITORS HE PUT THE SALAD INTO HIS WALLET CLIMBED OVER THE WALL AND WENT OFF TO FIND THE CASTLE OF HIS BELOVED
6877-79973-0030 AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR A FEW DAYS HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND IT
6877-79973-0031 AND WENT TO THE CASTLE TO ASK FOR SHELTER I AM SO TIRED HE SAID I CANNOT GO ANY FURTHER THE WITCH SAID
6877-79973-0032 HE ANSWERED I AM A MESSENGER FROM THE KING HE SENT ME TO FIND THE RAREST SALAD WHICH GROWS UNDER THE SUN I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND IT AND I CARRY IT WITH ME
6877-79973-0033 BUT THE SUN IS SO BURNING THAT I AM AFRAID THE TENDER PLANT WILL BE WITHERED
6877-79973-0034 WHEN THE OLD WITCH HEARD ABOUT THE RARE SALAD SHE FELT A GREAT DESIRE TO HAVE SOME AND SAID GOOD COUNTRYMAN LET ME TRY THE WONDERFUL SALAD BY ALL MEANS HE ANSWERED I HAVE TWO HEADS WITH ME
6877-79973-0035 AND YOU SHALL HAVE ONE SO SAYING HE OPENED HIS SACK AND HANDED HER THE BAD ONE THE WITCH HAD NO SUSPICIONS AND HER MOUTH SO WATERED FOR THE NEW DISH THAT SHE WENT TO THE KITCHEN HERSELF TO PREPARE IT
6877-79973-0036 WHEN IT WAS READY SHE COULD NOT WAIT TILL IT WAS PUT UPON THE TABLE BUT PUT A FEW LEAVES INTO HER MOUTH AT ONCE HARDLY HAD SHE SWALLOWED THEM WHEN SHE LOST HER HUMAN SHAPE AND RAN OUT INTO THE COURTYARD AS AN OLD SHE ASS
6877-79973-0037 THEN THE MAID CAME INTO THE KITCHEN SAW THE SALAD STANDING READY AND WAS ABOUT TO PUT IT ON THE TABLE BUT ON THE WAY THE FANCY SEIZED HER TO TASTE IT ACCORDING TO HER USUAL HABIT AND SHE ATE A FEW LEAVES
6877-79973-0038 IN THE MEANTIME THE MESSENGER WAS SITTING WITH THE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN AND AS NO ONE APPEARED WITH THE SALAD SHE ALSO WAS SEIZED WITH A DESIRE TO TASTE IT AND SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE SALAD
6877-79973-0039 BUT THE HUNTSMAN THOUGHT THE PLANT MUST HAVE DONE ITS WORK AND SAID I WILL GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND SEE AS SOON AS HE GOT DOWNSTAIRS HE SAW THE TWO ASSES RUNNING ABOUT AND THE SALAD LYING ON THE GROUND
6877-79973-0040 THIS IS ALL RIGHT HE SAID TWO OF THEM ARE DONE FOR THEN HE PICKED UP THE LEAVES PUT THEM ON A DISH AND TOOK THEM TO THE MAIDEN I AM BRINGING THE PRECIOUS FOOD TO YOU MYSELF SAID HE
6877-79973-0041 AND DROVE THEM ALONG TILL HE CAME TO A MILL HE TAPPED AT THE WINDOW AND THE MILLER PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND ASKED WHAT HE WANTED I HAVE THREE BAD ANIMALS HERE HE SAID THAT I WANT TO GET RID OF
6877-79973-0042 IF YOU WILL TAKE THEM AND FEED THEM AND TREAT THEM AS I WISH I WILL PAY YOU WHAT YOU LIKE TO ASK WHY NOT SAID THE MILLER HOW DO YOU WANT THEM TREATED
6877-79973-0043 THE HUNTSMAN SAID HE WANTED THE OLD SHE ASS THE WITCH TO BE WELL BEATEN THREE TIMES A DAY AND FED ONCE THE YOUNGER ONE WHICH WAS THE MAID BEATEN ONCE AND FED THREE TIMES
6877-79973-0044 THE YOUNGEST OF ALL WHO WAS THE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN WAS TO BE FED THREE TIMES AND NOT BEATEN AT ALL HE COULD NOT FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO HAVE HER BEATEN THEN HE WENT BACK TO THE CASTLE AND FOUND EVERYTHING HE WANTED IN IT
6877-79973-0045 A FEW DAYS LATER THE MILLER CAME AND TOLD HIM THAT THE OLD ASS WHICH WAS TO BE BEATEN THREE TIMES AND FED ONCE WAS DEAD THE OTHER TWO HE SAID
6877-79973-0046 WHICH ARE TO BE FED THREE TIMES ARE NOT DEAD BUT THEY ARE PINING AWAY AND WON'T LAST LONG THE HUNTSMAN'S HEART WAS STIRRED WITH PITY AND HE TOLD THE MILLER TO BRING THEM BACK TO HIM WHEN THEY CAME
6877-79973-0047 HE GAVE THEM SOME OF THE OTHER SALAD TO EAT SO THAT THEY TOOK THEIR HUMAN SHAPES AGAIN
