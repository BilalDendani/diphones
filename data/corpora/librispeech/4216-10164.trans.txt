4216-10164-0005 A PERCEPTIBLE SHADE OF SADNESS IN HIS LOOK AND MANNER MAGDALEN WAS SO CHANGED SINCE FRANK'S DEPARTURE THAT SHE HELPED THE GENERAL DEPRESSION INSTEAD OF RELIEVING IT
4216-10164-0006 ALL HER USUAL OCCUPATIONS WERE PURSUED WITH THE SAME WEARY INDIFFERENCE SHE SPENT HOURS ALONE IN HER OWN ROOM SHE LOST HER INTEREST IN BEING BRIGHTLY AND PRETTILY DRESSED HER EYES WERE HEAVY HER NERVES WERE IRRITABLE

4216-10164-0017 HIS EMPLOYERS ACTING UNDER A SENSE OF THEIR OBLIGATION TO THE GENTLEMAN BY WHOM FRANK HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED HAD CONSIDERED THE QUESTION CAREFULLY AND HAD DECIDED
4216-10164-0018 MISTER FRANCIS CLARE WAS TO SEND HIM FORTHWITH INTO ANOTHER QUARTER OF THE GLOBE

4216-10164-0020 NOW FORCED THEMSELVES ON THE EVER RELUCTANT EVER HELPLESS AND EVER UNGRATEFUL FRANK THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST THE FINAL ANSWER WAS TO BE AT THE OFFICE ON MONDAY THE TWENTIETH
4216-10164-0021 THE GLORIOUS PROSPECT OF HIS SON'S BANISHMENT TO CHINA APPEARED TO TURN HIS BRAIN
4216-10164-0022 HE SEIZED FRANK BY THE ARM AND ACTUALLY
4216-10164-0023 TO THE ANOMALY OF HIS EXISTENCE FRANK RUEFULLY NARRATED THE CHINESE PROPOSAL FOR THE SECOND TIME

4216-10164-0026 FRANK WAS PETRIFIED BY AN ABSOLUTE UNANIMITY OF OPINION WHICH HE HAD NOT ANTICIPATED AND MAGDALEN WAS CAUGHT FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE AT THE END OF ALL HER RESOURCES
4216-10164-0027 THAT HE PETITIONED FOR AN ADJOURNMENT BEFORE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS CONNECTED WITH HIS YOUNG FRIEND'S DEPARTURE WERE CONSIDERED IN DETAIL SUPPOSE WE ALL SLEEP UPON IT HE SAID

4216-10164-0030 FOR THE LOSS OF HER NIGHT'S REST
4216-10164-0031 AND THEN RETURNED BY ANOTHER PATH WHICH LED BACK PAST THE SIDE OF AN ORNAMENTAL SUMMER HOUSE COMMANDING A VIEW OVER THE FIELDS FROM A CORNER OF THE LAWN A SLIGHT NOISE LIKE AND YET NOT LIKE THE CHIRRUPING OF A BIRD
4216-10164-0032 CAUGHT HER EAR AS SHE APPROACHED THE SUMMER HOUSE SHE STEPPED ROUND TO THE ENTRANCE LOOKED IN AND DISCOVERED MAGDALEN AND FRANK SEATED CLOSE TOGETHER TO MISS GARTH'S HORROR
4216-10164-0033 AND WORSE STILL THE POSITION OF HER FACE AT THE MOMENT OF DISCOVERY SHOWED BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT SHE HAD JUST BEEN OFFERING TO THE VICTIM OF CHINESE COMMERCE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST

4216-10164-0052 HIS FACE COULD HARDLY HAVE EXPRESSED GREATER AMAZEMENT
4216-10164-0053 HE TRIED TO LOOK AT HER
4216-10164-0054 STEADILY REFUSED HIM THE OPPORTUNITY SHE KEPT HER FACE HIDDEN OVER HIS SHOULDER WAS SHE IN EARNEST HIS CHEEK STILL WET WITH HER TEARS ANSWERED FOR HER THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE OF SILENCE SHE WAITED WITH UNACCUSTOMED PATIENCE

4216-10164-0058 WHAT A REVELATION EVERY WORD EVERY ACTION THAT ESCAPED HER NOW OPENED BEFORE HIM SHE HAD MADE HIM HER GROWN UP PLAYFELLOW FROM HER CHILDHOOD TO THAT DAY SHE HAD ROMPED WITH HIM IN HER FROCKS
4216-10164-0059 HIS ARTLESS FATHERLY EXPERIENCE OF HER HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT
4216-10164-0060 OF HER ARMS CLASPED AROUND HIS NECK THE MAGDALEN OF HIS INNOCENT EXPERIENCE A WOMAN WITH THE MASTER PASSION OF HER SEX IN POSSESSION OF HER HEART ALREADY HAVE YOU THOUGHT LONG OF THIS MY DEAR HE ASKED

4216-10164-0062 ARE WE MUCH YOUNGER THAN YOU AND MAMMA WERE SHE ASKED SMILING THROUGH HER TEARS SHE TRIED TO LAY HER HEAD BACK IN ITS OLD POSITION
4216-10164-0063 HER FATHER CAUGHT HER ROUND THE WAIST FORCED HER BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE OF IT TO LOOK HIM IN THE FACE AND KISSED HER WITH A SUDDEN OUTBURST OF TENDERNESS WHICH BROUGHT THE TEARS THRONGING BACK THICKLY INTO HER EYES NOT MUCH YOUNGER MY CHILD HE
4216-10164-0064 SHE WAITED
4216-10164-0065 AT LAST HER GROWING ANXIETY URGED HER TO FOLLOW HIM INTO THE HOUSE A NEW TIMIDITY THROBBED IN HER HEART AS SHE DOUBTINGLY APPROACHED THE DOOR NEVER HAD SHE SEEN THE DEPTHS OF HER FATHER'S SIMPLE NATURE STIRRED AS THEY HAD BEEN STIRRED BY HER CONFESSION
4216-10164-0066 A SECOND LOOK AT HIM AS HE CAME NEARER RE ASSURED HER HE WAS COMPOSED AGAIN THOUGH NOT SO CHEERFUL AS USUAL SHE NOTICED THAT HE ADVANCED AND SPOKE TO HER WITH A FORBEARING GENTLENESS WHICH WAS MORE LIKE HIS MANNER
4216-10164-0067 GO IN MY LOVE HE SAID OPENING THE DOOR FOR HER WHICH HE HAD JUST CLOSED TELL YOUR MOTHER ALL YOU HAVE TOLD ME AND MORE IF YOU HAVE MORE TO SAY SHE IS BETTER PREPARED FOR YOU THAN I WAS
4216-10164-0068 AND FRANK SHALL KNOW WHAT WE DECIDE HER EYES BRIGHTENED AS THEY LOOKED INTO HIS FACE AND SAW THE DECISION THERE ALREADY WITH THE DOUBLE PENETRATION OF HER WOMANHOOD AND HER LOVE HAPPY AND BEAUTIFUL IN HER HAPPINESS
4216-10164-0069 SHE PUT HIS HAND TO HER LIPS AND WENT WITHOUT HESITATION INTO THE MORNING ROOM THERE HER FATHER'S WORDS HAD SMOOTHED THE WAY FOR HER
4216-10164-0070 AND ONLY THE PLEASURE OF IT REMAINED HER MOTHER HAD BEEN HER AGE ONCE HER MOTHER WOULD KNOW HOW FOND SHE WAS OF FRANK SO THE COMING INTERVIEW WAS ANTICIPATED IN HER THOUGHTS AND EXCEPT
4216-10164-0071 THAT THERE WAS AN UNACCOUNTABLE APPEARANCE OF RESTRAINT IN MISSUS VANSTONE'S FIRST RECEPTION OF HER WAS ANTICIPATED ARIGHT AFTER A LITTLE THE MOTHER'S QUESTIONS CAME MORE AND MORE UNRESERVEDLY FROM THE SWEET
4216-10164-0072 SHE LIVED AGAIN THROUGH HER OWN YOUNG DAYS OF HOPE AND LOVE IN MAGDALEN'S REPLIES THE NEXT MORNING THE ALL IMPORTANT DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED IN WORDS MISTER VANSTONE TOOK HIS DAUGHTER UPSTAIRS INTO HER MOTHER'S ROOM
4216-10164-0073 AND THERE PLACED BEFORE HER THE RESULT OF THE YESTERDAY'S CONSULTATION
4216-10164-0074 HE SPOKE WITH PERFECT KINDNESS AND SELF POSSESSION OF MANNER BUT
4216-10164-0075 HE INFORMED MAGDALEN
4216-10164-0076 IT HAD BEEN IN PART PERHAPS THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF HER CHILDISH FAMILIARITY WITH HIM IN PART ALSO THE RESULT OF THE CLOSER INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WHICH THE THEATRICAL ENTERTAINMENT HAD NECESSARILY PRODUCED
4216-10164-0077 FOR HER SAKE BECAUSE HER HAPPY FUTURE WAS THEIR DEAREST CARE FOR FRANK'S SAKE BECAUSE THEY WERE BOUND TO GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HIMSELF WORTHY OF THE TRUST CONFIDED IN HIM
4216-10164-0078 HE AND HIS YOUNGER BROTHERS HAD ALMOST FILLED THE PLACES TO THEM OF THOSE OTHER CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN WHOM THEY HAD LOST ALTHOUGH THEY FIRMLY BELIEVED THEIR GOOD OPINION OF FRANK TO BE WELL FOUNDED
4216-10164-0079 DURING THAT YEAR FRANK WAS TO REMAIN AT THE OFFICE IN LONDON HIS EMPLOYERS BEING INFORMED BEFOREHAND
4216-10164-0080 HE WAS TO CONSIDER THIS CONCESSION AS A RECOGNITION OF THE ATTACHMENT BETWEEN MAGDALEN AND HIMSELF ON CERTAIN TERMS ONLY IF DURING THE YEAR OF PROBATION HE FAILED TO JUSTIFY THE CONFIDENCE PLACED IN HIM
4216-10164-0081 A CONFIDENCE WHICH HAD LED MISTER VANSTONE TO TAKE UNRESERVEDLY UPON HIMSELF THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF FRANK'S FUTURE PROSPECTS THE MARRIAGE SCHEME WAS TO BE CONSIDERED FROM THAT MOMENT
4216-10164-0082 IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE RESULT TO WHICH MISTER VANSTONE CONFIDENTLY LOOKED FORWARD REALLY OCCURRED
4216-10164-0083 YEAR PROVED HIS CLAIM TO THE MOST
4216-10164-0084 THEN MAGDALEN HERSELF SHOULD REWARD HIM WITH ALL THAT A WOMAN CAN BESTOW AND THE FUTURE WHICH HIS PRESENT EMPLOYERS
4216-10164-0085 SHOULD BE REALIZED IN ONE YEAR'S TIME BY THE DOWRY OF HIS YOUNG WIFE AS HER FATHER DREW THAT PICTURE OF THE FUTURE THE OUTBURST OF MAGDALEN'S GRATITUDE COULD NO LONGER BE RESTRAINED SHE WAS DEEPLY TOUCHED
4216-10164-0086 SHE SPOKE FROM HER INMOST HEART MISTER VANSTONE WAITED UNTIL HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS WIFE WERE COMPOSED AGAIN AND THEN ADDED THE LAST WORDS OF EXPLANATION WHICH WERE NOW LEFT FOR HIM TO SPEAK
4216-10164-0087 YOU UNDERSTAND MY LOVE HE SAID THAT I AM NOT ANTICIPATING FRANK'S LIVING IN IDLENESS ON HIS WIFE'S MEANS MY PLAN FOR HIM IS THAT HE SHOULD STILL PROFIT BY THE INTEREST WHICH HIS PRESENT EMPLOYERS TAKE IN HIM
4216-10164-0088 I SHALL LIMIT THE SUM MY DEAR
4216-10164-0089 WE SHALL ALL BE ALIVE AND HEARTY I HOPE
4216-10164-0090 MY WILL MADE LONG BEFORE I EVER THOUGHT OF HAVING A SON IN LAW DIVIDES MY FORTUNE INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS
4216-10164-0091 AND THE OTHER PART IS FAIRLY DIVIDED BETWEEN MY CHILDREN YOU WILL HAVE YOUR SHARE ON YOUR WEDDING DAY AND NORAH WILL HAVE HERS WHEN SHE MARRIES
4216-10164-0092 WHILE I WALK OVER TO THE COTTAGE HE STOPPED
4216-10164-0093 WHAT MUST YOU DO AT THE COTTAGE PAPA ASKED MAGDALEN AFTER HAVING VAINLY WAITED FOR HIM TO FINISH THE SENTENCE OF HIS OWN ACCORD
4216-10164-0094 WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT MISTER CLARE'S CONSENT IS STILL WANTING TO SETTLE THIS MATTER
4216-10164-0095 MISSUS VANSTONE HAD BEEN ALARMED BY THE CHANGE IN HIM ALSO
4216-10164-0096 TURNED IT SUDDENLY AS IF SHE WAS IN PAIN ARE YOU NOT WELL MAMMA ASKED MAGDALEN QUITE WELL MY LOVE
