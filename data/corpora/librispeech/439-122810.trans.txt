439-122810-0006 BUT KAREN HERSELF WAS CLEANLY AND NICELY DRESSED SHE MUST LEARN TO READ AND SEW AND PEOPLE SAID SHE WAS A NICE LITTLE THING BUT THE LOOKING GLASS SAID THOU ART MORE THAN NICE THOU ART BEAUTIFUL
439-122810-0007 NOW THE QUEEN ONCE TRAVELLED THROUGH THE LAND AND SHE HAD HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WITH HER AND THIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS A PRINCESS AND PEOPLE STREAMED TO THE CASTLE AND KAREN WAS THERE ALSO AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS STOOD IN HER FINE WHITE DRESS
439-122810-0008 IN A WINDOW AND LET HERSELF BE STARED AT SHE HAD NEITHER A TRAIN NOR A GOLDEN CROWN BUT SPLENDID RED MOROCCO SHOES THEY WERE CERTAINLY FAR HANDSOMER
439-122810-0009 NOTHING IN THE WORLD CAN BE COMPARED WITH RED SHOES NOW KAREN WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE CONFIRMED SHE HAD NEW CLOTHES AND WAS TO HAVE NEW SHOES ALSO
439-122810-0010 THE RICH SHOEMAKER IN THE CITY TOOK THE MEASURE OF HER LITTLE FOOT THIS TOOK PLACE AT HIS HOUSE IN HIS ROOM WHERE STOOD LARGE GLASS CASES FILLED WITH ELEGANT SHOES AND BRILLIANT BOOTS
439-122810-0011 ALL THIS LOOKED CHARMING BUT THE OLD LADY COULD NOT SEE WELL AND SO HAD NO PLEASURE IN THEM IN THE MIDST OF THE SHOES STOOD A PAIR OF RED ONES JUST LIKE THOSE THE PRINCESS HAD WORN HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE

439-122810-0013 AND THEY FITTED AND WERE BOUGHT BUT THE OLD LADY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEIR BEING RED ELSE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED KAREN TO HAVE GONE IN RED SHOES TO BE CONFIRMED YET SUCH WAS THE CASE
439-122810-0014 EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HER FEET AND WHEN SHE STEPPED THROUGH THE CHANCEL DOOR ON THE CHURCH PAVEMENT IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE OLD FIGURES ON THE TOMBS THOSE PORTRAITS OF OLD PREACHERS AND PREACHERS WIVES
439-122810-0015 WITH STIFF RUFFS AND LONG BLACK DRESSES FIXED THEIR EYES ON HER RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF THEM AS THE CLERGYMAN LAID HIS HAND UPON HER HEAD AND SPOKE OF THE HOLY BAPTISM OF THE COVENANT WITH GOD
439-122810-0016 AND THE ORGAN PEALED SO SOLEMNLY THE SWEET CHILDREN'S VOICES SANG AND THE OLD MUSIC DIRECTORS SANG BUT KAREN ONLY THOUGHT OF HER RED SHOES
439-122810-0017 IN THE AFTERNOON THE OLD LADY HEARD FROM EVERYONE THAT THE SHOES HAD BEEN RED AND SHE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY WRONG OF KAREN THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL BECOMING AND THAT IN FUTURE KAREN SHOULD ONLY GO IN BLACK SHOES TO CHURCH
439-122810-0018 EVEN WHEN SHE SHOULD BE OLDER THE NEXT SUNDAY THERE WAS THE SACRAMENT AND KAREN LOOKED AT THE BLACK SHOES LOOKED AT THE RED ONES LOOKED AT THEM AGAIN AND PUT ON THE RED SHOES
439-122810-0019 THE SUN SHONE GLORIOUSLY KAREN AND THE OLD LADY WALKED ALONG THE PATH THROUGH THE CORN IT WAS RATHER DUSTY THERE AT THE CHURCH DOOR STOOD AN OLD SOLDIER WITH A CRUTCH AND WITH A WONDERFULLY LONG BEARD
439-122810-0020 WHICH WAS MORE RED THAN WHITE AND HE BOWED TO THE GROUND AND ASKED THE OLD LADY WHETHER HE MIGHT DUST HER SHOES AND KAREN STRETCHED OUT HER LITTLE FOOT SEE WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES
439-122810-0021 SAID THE SOLDIER SIT FIRM WHEN YOU DANCE AND HE PUT HIS HAND OUT TOWARDS THE SOLES
439-122810-0022 AND WENT INTO THE CHURCH WITH KAREN AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH LOOKED AT KAREN'S RED SHOES AND ALL THE PICTURES AND AS KAREN KNELT BEFORE THE ALTAR AND RAISED THE CUP TO HER LIPS
439-122810-0023 SHE ONLY THOUGHT OF THE RED SHOES AND THEY SEEMED TO SWIM IN IT AND SHE FORGOT TO SING HER PSALM AND SHE FORGOT TO PRAY OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN NOW ALL THE PEOPLE WENT OUT OF CHURCH
439-122810-0024 AND THE OLD LADY GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE KAREN RAISED HER FOOT TO GET IN AFTER HER WHEN THE OLD SOLDIER SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES AND KAREN COULD NOT HELP DANCING A STEP OR TWO
439-122810-0025 AND WHEN SHE BEGAN HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE IT WAS JUST AS THOUGH THE SHOES HAD POWER OVER THEM SHE DANCED ROUND THE CHURCH CORNER SHE COULD NOT LEAVE OFF THE COACHMAN WAS OBLIGED TO RUN AFTER AND CATCH HOLD OF HER
439-122810-0026 AND HE LIFTED HER IN THE CARRIAGE BUT HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE SO THAT SHE TROD ON THE OLD LADY DREADFULLY AT LENGTH SHE TOOK THE SHOES OFF AND THEN HER LEGS HAD PEACE
439-122810-0027 THE SHOES WERE PLACED IN A CLOSET AT HOME BUT KAREN COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM NOW THE OLD LADY WAS SICK
439-122810-0028 SHE MUST BE NURSED AND WAITED UPON AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHOSE DUTY IT WAS SO MUCH AS KAREN'S BUT THERE WAS A GREAT BALL IN THE CITY TO WHICH KAREN WAS INVITED SHE LOOKED AT THE OLD LADY WHO COULD NOT RECOVER
439-122810-0029 SHE LOOKED AT THE RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE NO SIN IN IT SHE PUT ON THE RED SHOES SHE MIGHT DO THAT ALSO SHE THOUGHT BUT THEN SHE WENT TO THE BALL AND BEGAN TO DANCE
439-122810-0030 WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE TO THE RIGHT THE SHOES WOULD DANCE TO THE LEFT AND WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE UP THE ROOM THE SHOES DANCED BACK AGAIN DOWN THE STEPS INTO THE STREET AND OUT OF THE CITY GATE SHE DANCED
439-122810-0031 AND WAS FORCED TO DANCE STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE GLOOMY WOOD THEN IT WAS SUDDENLY LIGHT UP AMONG THE TREES AND SHE FANCIED IT MUST BE THE MOON FOR THERE WAS A FACE
439-122810-0032 HE SAT THERE NODDED HIS HEAD AND SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES THEN SHE WAS TERRIFIED AND WANTED TO FLING OFF THE RED SHOES BUT THEY CLUNG FAST
439-122810-0033 AND SHE PULLED DOWN HER STOCKINGS BUT THE SHOES SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN TO HER FEET AND SHE DANCED AND MUST DANCE OVER FIELDS AND MEADOWS IN RAIN AND SUNSHINE BY NIGHT AND DAY BUT AT NIGHT IT WAS THE MOST FEARFUL
439-122810-0034 SHE DANCED OVER THE CHURCHYARD BUT THE DEAD DID NOT DANCE THEY HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO DANCE
439-122810-0035 WHERE THE BITTER TANSY GREW BUT FOR HER THERE WAS NEITHER PEACE NOR REST AND WHEN SHE DANCED TOWARDS THE OPEN CHURCH DOOR SHE SAW AN ANGEL STANDING THERE HE WORE LONG WHITE GARMENTS

439-122810-0039 FOR THE SHOES CARRIED HER THROUGH THE GATE INTO THE FIELDS ACROSS ROADS AND BRIDGES AND SHE MUST KEEP EVER DANCING ONE MORNING SHE DANCED PAST A DOOR WHICH SHE WELL KNEW WITHIN SOUNDED A PSALM
439-122810-0040 A COFFIN DECKED WITH FLOWERS WAS BORNE FORTH THEN SHE KNEW THAT THE OLD LADY WAS DEAD AND FELT THAT SHE WAS ABANDONED BY ALL AND CONDEMNED BY THE ANGEL OF GOD SHE DANCED

439-122810-0048 AND HOLDS HER HEAD SO HIGH AND AWAY SHE WENT BOLDLY BUT SHE HAD NOT GOT FARTHER THAN THE CHURCHYARD GATE BEFORE SHE SAW THE RED SHOES DANCING BEFORE HER AND SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AND TURNED BACK
439-122810-0049 AND REPENTED OF HER SIN FROM HER HEART AND SHE WENT TO THE PARSONAGE AND BEGGED THAT THEY WOULD TAKE HER INTO SERVICE SHE WOULD BE VERY INDUSTRIOUS SHE SAID AND WOULD DO EVERYTHING SHE COULD
439-122810-0050 SHE DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE WAGES ONLY SHE WISHED TO HAVE A HOME AND BE WITH GOOD PEOPLE
439-122810-0051 AND SHE WAS INDUSTRIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL SHE SAT STILL AND LISTENED WHEN THE CLERGYMAN READ THE BIBLE IN THE EVENINGS ALL THE CHILDREN THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HER BUT WHEN THEY SPOKE OF DRESS AND GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY
439-122810-0052 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WHEN THE FAMILY WAS GOING TO CHURCH THEY ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT GO WITH THEM BUT SHE GLANCED SORROWFULLY WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AT HER CRUTCHES
439-122810-0053 THE FAMILY WENT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD BUT SHE WENT ALONE INTO HER LITTLE CHAMBER THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR A BED AND CHAIR TO STAND IN IT AND HERE SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER PRAYER BOOK
439-122810-0054 AND WHILST SHE READ WITH A PIOUS MIND THE WIND BORE THE STRAINS OF THE ORGAN TOWARDS HER AND SHE RAISED HER TEARFUL COUNTENANCE AND SAID O GOD HELP ME AND THE SUN SHONE SO CLEARLY
439-122810-0055 AND STRAIGHT BEFORE HER STOOD THE ANGEL OF GOD IN WHITE GARMENTS THE SAME SHE HAD SEEN THAT NIGHT AT THE CHURCH DOOR BUT HE NO LONGER CARRIED THE SHARP SWORD BUT IN ITS STEAD A SPLENDID GREEN SPRAY FULL OF ROSES
439-122810-0056 AND HE TOUCHED THE CEILING WITH THE SPRAY AND THE CEILING ROSE SO HIGH AND WHERE HE HAD TOUCHED IT THERE GLEAMED A GOLDEN STAR AND HE TOUCHED THE WALLS AND THEY WIDENED OUT AND SHE SAW THE ORGAN WHICH WAS PLAYING
