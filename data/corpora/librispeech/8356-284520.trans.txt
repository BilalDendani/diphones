8356-284520-0000 IN THE STREET UP THERE WAS AN OLD A VERY OLD HOUSE IT WAS ALMOST THREE HUNDRED YEARS OLD
8356-284520-0001 FOR THAT MIGHT BE KNOWN BY READING THE GREAT BEAM ON WHICH THE DATE OF THE YEAR WAS CARVED TOGETHER WITH TULIPS AND HOP BINDS THERE WERE WHOLE VERSES SPELLED AS IN FORMER TIMES
8356-284520-0002 THE ONE STORY STOOD FORWARD A GREAT WAY OVER THE OTHER AND DIRECTLY UNDER THE EAVES WAS A LEADEN SPOUT WITH A DRAGON'S HEAD THE RAIN WATER SHOULD HAVE RUN OUT OF THE MOUTH BUT IT RAN OUT OF THE BELLY FOR THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE SPOUT
8356-284520-0003 WITH LARGE WINDOW PANES AND SMOOTH WALLS ONE COULD EASILY SEE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OLD HOUSE THEY CERTAINLY THOUGHT
8356-284520-0004 AND THEN THE PROJECTING WINDOWS STAND SO FAR OUT THAT NO ONE CAN SEE FROM OUR WINDOWS WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT DIRECTION THE STEPS ARE AS BROAD AS THOSE OF A PALACE AND AS HIGH AS TO A CHURCH TOWER
8356-284520-0005 THE IRON RAILINGS LOOK JUST LIKE THE DOOR TO AN OLD FAMILY VAULT
8356-284520-0006 THAT'S SO STUPID ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET WERE ALSO NEW AND NEAT HOUSES AND THEY THOUGHT JUST AS THE OTHERS DID BUT AT THE WINDOW OPPOSITE THE OLD HOUSE
8356-284520-0007 THERE SAT A LITTLE BOY WITH FRESH ROSY CHEEKS AND BRIGHT BEAMING EYES HE CERTAINLY LIKED THE OLD HOUSE BEST AND THAT BOTH IN SUNSHINE AND MOONSHINE
8356-284520-0008 AND WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS AT THE WALL WHERE THE MORTAR HAD FALLEN OUT HE COULD SIT AND FIND OUT THERE THE STRANGEST FIGURES IMAGINABLE
8356-284520-0009 WITH STEPS PROJECTING WINDOWS AND POINTED GABLES HE COULD SEE SOLDIERS WITH HALBERDS AND SPOUTS WHERE THE WATER RAN LIKE DRAGONS AND SERPENTS
8356-284520-0010 AND THERE LIVED AN OLD MAN WHO WORE PLUSH BREECHES AND HE HAD A COAT WITH LARGE BRASS BUTTONS AND A WIG THAT ONE COULD SEE WAS A REAL WIG EVERY MORNING THERE CAME AN OLD FELLOW TO HIM WHO PUT HIS ROOMS IN ORDER
8356-284520-0011 AND WENT ON ERRANDS OTHERWISE THE OLD MAN IN THE PLUSH BREECHES WAS QUITE ALONE IN THE OLD HOUSE NOW AND THEN HE CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT AND THE LITTLE BOY NODDED TO HIM AND THE OLD MAN NODDED AGAIN
8356-284520-0012 AND SO THEY BECAME ACQUAINTANCES AND THEN THEY WERE FRIENDS ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER BUT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE THE LITTLE BOY HEARD HIS PARENTS SAY
8356-284520-0013 THE OLD MAN OPPOSITE IS VERY WELL OFF BUT HE IS SO VERY VERY LONELY THE SUNDAY FOLLOWING THE LITTLE BOY TOOK SOMETHING AND WRAPPED IT UP IN A PIECE OF PAPER
8356-284520-0014 WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY AND WHEN THE MAN WHO WENT ON ERRANDS CAME PAST HE SAID TO HIM I SAY MASTER WILL YOU GIVE THIS TO THE OLD MAN OVER THE WAY FROM ME I HAVE TWO PEWTER SOLDIERS THIS IS ONE OF THEM
8356-284520-0015 AND HE SHALL HAVE IT FOR I KNOW HE IS SO VERY VERY LONELY AND THE OLD ERRAND MAN LOOKED QUITE PLEASED NODDED AND TOOK THE PEWTER SOLDIER OVER TO THE OLD HOUSE AFTERWARDS THERE CAME A MESSAGE
8356-284520-0016 ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY WERE POLISHED ON ACCOUNT OF THE VISIT AND IT WAS AS IF THE CARVED OUT TRUMPETERS FOR THERE WERE TRUMPETERS WHO STOOD IN TULIPS CARVED OUT ON THE DOOR BLEW WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT THEIR CHEEKS APPEARED SO MUCH ROUNDER THAN BEFORE
8356-284520-0017 YES THEY BLEW TRATERATRA THE LITTLE BOY COMES TRATERATRA AND THEN THE DOOR OPENED THE WHOLE PASSAGE WAS HUNG WITH PORTRAITS OF KNIGHTS IN ARMOR AND LADIES IN SILKEN GOWNS
8356-284520-0018 AND THE ARMOR RATTLED AND THE SILKEN GOWNS RUSTLED AND THEN THERE WAS A FLIGHT OF STAIRS WHICH WENT A GOOD WAY UPWARDS AND A LITTLE WAY DOWNWARDS AND THEN ONE CAME ON A BALCONY WHICH WAS IN A VERY DILAPIDATED STATE
8356-284520-0019 SURE ENOUGH WITH LARGE HOLES AND LONG CREVICES BUT GRASS GREW THERE
8356-284520-0020 FOR THE WHOLE BALCONY OUTSIDE THE YARD AND THE WALLS WERE OVERGROWN WITH SO MUCH GREEN STUFF THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A GARDEN ONLY A BALCONY HERE STOOD OLD FLOWER POTS WITH FACES AND ASSES EARS
8356-284520-0021 AND THE FLOWERS GREW JUST AS THEY LIKED ONE OF THE POTS WAS QUITE OVERRUN ON ALL SIDES WITH PINKS THAT IS TO SAY WITH THE GREEN PART SHOOT STOOD BY SHOOT AND IT SAID QUITE DISTINCTLY THE AIR HAS CHERISHED ME
8356-284520-0022 THE SUN HAS KISSED ME AND PROMISED ME A LITTLE FLOWER ON SUNDAY A LITTLE FLOWER ON SUNDAY AND THEN THEY ENTERED A CHAMBER WHERE THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH HOG'S LEATHER AND PRINTED WITH GOLD FLOWERS
8356-284520-0023 THE GILDING DECAYS BUT HOG'S LEATHER STAYS SAID THE WALLS AND THERE STOOD EASY CHAIRS WITH SUCH HIGH BACKS AND SO CARVED OUT

8356-284520-0025 AND THEN THE LITTLE BOY CAME INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE PROJECTING WINDOWS WERE AND WHERE THE OLD MAN SAT I THANK YOU FOR THE PEWTER SOLDIER MY LITTLE FRIEND SAID THE OLD MAN
8356-284520-0026 THANKEE THANKEE OR CRANKY CRANKY SOUNDED FROM ALL THE FURNITURE
8356-284520-0027 THAT EACH ARTICLE STOOD IN THE OTHER'S WAY TO GET A LOOK AT THE LITTLE BOY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL HUNG A PICTURE REPRESENTING A BEAUTIFUL LADY SO YOUNG SO GLAD
8356-284520-0028 BUT DRESSED QUITE AS IN FORMER TIMES WITH CLOTHES THAT STOOD QUITE STIFF AND WITH POWDER IN HER HAIR SHE NEITHER SAID THANKEE THANKEE NOR CRANKY CRANKY BUT LOOKED WITH HER MILD EYES AT THE LITTLE BOY
8356-284520-0029 WHO DIRECTLY ASKED THE OLD MAN WHERE DID YOU GET HER YONDER AT THE BROKER'S SAID THE OLD MAN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY PICTURES HANGING NO ONE KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT THEM

8356-284520-0036 YES THAT WAS A PICTURE BOOK THE OLD MAN NOW WENT INTO THE OTHER ROOM TO FETCH PRESERVES APPLES AND NUTS YES IT WAS DELIGHTFUL OVER THERE IN THE OLD HOUSE
8356-284520-0037 I CANNOT BEAR IT ANY LONGER SAID THE PEWTER SOLDIER WHO SAT ON THE DRAWERS IT IS SO LONELY AND MELANCHOLY HERE BUT WHEN ONE HAS BEEN IN A FAMILY CIRCLE ONE CANNOT ACCUSTOM ONESELF TO THIS LIFE

8356-284520-0042 THEN IN CAME THE OLD MAN WITH THE MOST PLEASED AND HAPPY FACE THE MOST DELICIOUS PRESERVES APPLES AND NUTS AND SO THE LITTLE BOY THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE PEWTER SOLDIER
8356-284520-0043 THE LITTLE BOY RETURNED HOME HAPPY AND PLEASED AND WEEKS AND DAYS PASSED AWAY AND NODS WERE MADE TO THE OLD HOUSE AND FROM THE OLD HOUSE
8356-284520-0044 AND THEN THE LITTLE BOY WENT OVER THERE AGAIN THE CARVED TRUMPETERS BLEW

8356-284520-0062 IT LAY QUITE UP OVER THE STEPS JUST AS IF THERE WAS NO ONE AT HOME NOR WAS THERE ANY ONE AT HOME THE OLD MAN WAS DEAD
8356-284520-0063 IN THE EVENING THERE WAS A HEARSE SEEN BEFORE THE DOOR AND HE WAS BORNE INTO IT IN HIS COFFIN HE WAS NOW TO GO OUT INTO THE COUNTRY TO LIE IN HIS GRAVE
8356-284520-0064 HE WAS DRIVEN OUT THERE BUT NO ONE FOLLOWED ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE DEAD AND THE LITTLE BOY KISSED HIS HAND TO THE COFFIN AS IT WAS DRIVEN AWAY
8356-284520-0065 SOME DAYS AFTERWARDS THERE WAS AN AUCTION AT THE OLD HOUSE AND THE LITTLE BOY SAW FROM HIS WINDOW

8356-284520-0069 THAT WAS A RELIEF SAID THE NEIGHBORING HOUSES A FINE HOUSE WAS BUILT THERE WITH LARGE WINDOWS AND SMOOTH WHITE WALLS
8356-284520-0070 BUT BEFORE IT WHERE THE OLD HOUSE HAD IN FACT STOOD WAS A LITTLE GARDEN LAID OUT AND A WILD GRAPEVINE RAN UP THE WALL OF THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE BEFORE THE GARDEN
8356-284520-0071 THERE WAS A LARGE IRON RAILING WITH AN IRON DOOR IT LOOKED QUITE SPLENDID AND PEOPLE STOOD STILL AND PEEPED IN AND THE SPARROWS HUNG BY SCORES IN THE VINE AND CHATTERED AWAY AT EACH OTHER AS WELL AS THEY COULD
