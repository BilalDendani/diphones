6484-69655-0000 YOU HAVE MISSED THE SOUP SAID HER LADYSHIP LOOKING UP AT HIM WITH A SWEET SMILE ALL YOU ARTISTS ARE ALIKE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHATEVER OF TIME AND HOW HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED WITH THAT CHARMING MYSTERIOUS PERSON THE PRINCESS ZISKA
6484-69655-0001 HE WAS EXTREMELY PALE AND HAD THE AIR OF ONE WHO HAS GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT MENTAL EXHAUSTION I HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED AS WELL AS I EXPECTED HE ANSWERED SLOWLY I THINK MY HAND MUST HAVE LOST ITS CUNNING
6484-69655-0002 AT ANY RATE WHATEVER THE REASON MAY BE ART HAS BEEN DEFEATED BY NATURE HE CRUMBLED UP THE PIECE OF BREAD NEAR HIS PLATE IN SMALL PORTIONS WITH A KIND OF INVOLUNTARY VIOLENCE IN THE ACTION
6484-69655-0003 AND DOCTOR DEAN DELIBERATELY DRAWING OUT A PAIR OF SPECTACLES FROM THEIR CASE ADJUSTED THEM AND SURVEYED HIM CURIOUSLY YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU CANNOT PAINT THE PRINCESS'S PICTURE
6484-69655-0004 I DON'T SAY THAT HE REPLIED I CAN PAINT SOMETHING SOMETHING WHICH YOU CAN CALL A PICTURE IF YOU LIKE BUT THERE IS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE PRINCESS ZISKA IN IT SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND I CAN GET NOTHING OF HER BEAUTY
6484-69655-0005 I CAN ONLY GET THE REFLECTION OF A FACE WHICH IS NOT HERS HOW VERY CURIOUS EXCLAIMED LADY FULKEWARD QUITE PSYCHOLOGICAL IS IT NOT DOCTOR IT IS ALMOST CREEPY AND SHE MANAGED TO PRODUCE A DELICATE SHUDDER OF HER WHITE SHOULDERS
6484-69655-0006 WITHOUT CRACKING THE BLANC DE PERLE ENAMEL IT WILL BE SOMETHING FRESH FOR YOU TO STUDY POSSIBLY IT WILL POSSIBLY SAID THE DOCTOR
6484-69655-0007 BUT IT ISN'T THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD OF PAINTERS WHO UNCONSCIOUSLY PRODUCE OTHER FACES THAN THOSE OF THEIR SITTERS I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER A CASE IN POINT A GENTLEMAN FAMOUS FOR HIS CHARITIES AND GENERAL BENEVOLENCE
6484-69655-0008 HAD HIS PORTRAIT PAINTED BY A GREAT ARTIST FOR PRESENTATION TO THE TOWN HALL OF HIS NATIVE PLACE AND THE ARTIST WAS QUITE UNABLE TO AVOID MAKING HIM UNTO THE LIKENESS OF A VILLAIN IT WAS QUITE A DISTRESSING AFFAIR
6484-69655-0009 THE PAINTER WAS PROBABLY MORE DISTRESSED THAN ANYBODY ABOUT IT AND HE TRIED BY EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS IN HIS POWER TO IMPART A TRUTHFUL AND NOBLE ASPECT TO THE COUNTENANCE OF THE MAN WHO WAS KNOWN AND ADMITTED TO BE A BENEFACTOR TO HIS RACE
6484-69655-0010 BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN THE PORTRAIT WHEN FINISHED WAS THE PORTRAIT OF A STRANGER AND A SCOUNDREL THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM IT WAS INTENDED DECLARED THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH A LIBEL ON THEIR GENEROUS FRIEND HUNG UP IN THEIR TOWN HALL
6484-69655-0011 THE PAINTER WAS IN DESPAIR AND THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GENERAL HUBBUB WHEN LO AND BEHOLD THE NOBLE PERSONAGE HIMSELF WAS SUDDENLY ARRESTED FOR A BRUTAL MURDER
6484-69655-0012 BUT OF COURSE YOU WILL TRY AGAIN THE PRINCESS WILL SURELY GIVE YOU ANOTHER SITTING
6484-69655-0013 WITH A KIND OF ANGRY OBSTINACY IN HIS TONE THE MORE SO AS SHE HAS TOLD ME I WILL NEVER SUCCEED IN PAINTING HER SHE TOLD YOU THAT DID SHE PUT IN DOCTOR DEAN WITH AN AIR OF LIVELY INTEREST YES
6484-69655-0014 JUST THEN THE HANDING ROUND OF FRESH DISHES AND THE CLATTER OF KNIVES AND FORKS EFFECTUALLY PUT A STOP TO THE CONVERSATION FOR THE TIME
6484-69655-0015 SAW THAT DENZIL MURRAY AND HIS SISTER WERE DINING APART AT A SMALLER TABLE WITH YOUNG LORD FULKEWARD AND ROSS COURTNEY HELEN WAS LOOKING HER FAIREST AND BEST THAT EVENING HER SWEET FACE FRAMED IN ITS ANGEL AUREOLE OF BRIGHT HAIR
6484-69655-0016 HAD A SINGULAR LOOK OF PURENESS AND TRUTH EXPRESSED UPON IT RARE TO FIND IN ANY WOMAN BEYOND HER EARLY TEENS UNCONSCIOUSLY TO HIMSELF
6484-69655-0017 AS HE CAUGHT A VIEW OF HER DELICATE PROFILE AND LADY FULKEWARD'S SHARP EARS HEARD THE SOUND OF THAT SIGH ISN'T THAT A CHARMING LITTLE PARTY OVER THERE SHE ASKED YOUNG PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY ALWAYS LIKE TO BE TOGETHER
6484-69655-0018 THAT VERY SWEET GIRL MISS MURRAY WAS SO MUCH DISTRESSED ABOUT HER BROTHER TO DAY SOMETHING WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM A TOUCH OF FEVER I BELIEVE
6484-69655-0019 FULKE IS A DEAR BOY YOU KNOW VERY CONSOLING IN HIS WAYS THOUGH HE SAYS SO LITTLE THEN MISTER COURTNEY VOLUNTEERED TO JOIN THEM AND THERE THEY ARE THE CHETWYND LYLES ARE GONE TO A BIG DINNER AT THE CONTINENTAL THIS EVENING THE CHETWYND LYLES

6484-69655-0022 ELDERLY YOUTHFUL IS A VERY CONVENIENT EXPRESSION AND APPLIES PERFECTLY TO PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO BE OLD AND CANNOT POSSIBLY BE YOUNG NONSENSE I WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU AND HER LADYSHIP OPENED HER JEWELLED FAN AND SPREAD IT BEFORE HER EYES
6484-69655-0023 TO COMPLETELY SCREEN THE OBJECTIONABLE DOCTOR FROM VIEW DON'T YOU KNOW YOUR THEORIES ARE QUITE OUT OF DATE NOBODY IS OLD WE ALL UTTERLY REFUSE TO BE OLD WHY AND SHE SHUT HER FAN WITH A SUDDEN JERK
6484-69655-0024 NEVER MADAM SAID DOCTOR DEAN GALLANTLY
6484-69655-0025 YOU HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE FURNACE OF MARRIAGE AND COME OUT UNSCATHED TIME HAS DONE ITS WORST WITH YOU AND NOW RETREATS BAFFLED AND POWERLESS IT CAN TOUCH YOU NO MORE WHETHER THIS WAS MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT OR THE REVERSE
6484-69655-0026 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO SAY BUT LADY FULKEWARD GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED IT AS THE CHOICEST FLATTERY AND BOWED SMILING AND GRATIFIED DINNER WAS NOW DRAWING TO ITS END AND PEOPLE WERE GIVING THEIR ORDERS FOR COFFEE TO BE SERVED TO THEM ON THE TERRACE AND IN THE GARDENS
6484-69655-0027 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR PICTURE OF THE PRINCESS HE SAID THAT IS IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION
6484-69655-0028 ONLY IT ISN'T THE PRINCESS IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE A FAINT SHUDDER PASSED OVER HIM THE DOCTOR NOTICED IT TALKING OF CURIOUS THINGS WENT ON THAT IRREPRESSIBLE SAVANT I STARTED HUNTING FOR A PARTICULAR SCARABEUS TO DAY
6484-69655-0029 I COULDN'T FIND IT OF COURSE IT GENERALLY TAKES YEARS TO FIND EVEN A TRIFLE THAT ONE ESPECIALLY WANTS BUT I CAME ACROSS A QUEER OLD MAN IN ONE OF THE CURIOSITY SHOPS WHO TOLD ME THAT OVER AT KARNAK

6484-69655-0032 AND TO KNOW MANY THINGS OF WHICH WE ARE IGNORANT THEN YOU KNOW LAST NIGHT SHE ADOPTED THE COSTUME OF A DANCER OF THAT PERIOD NAMED ZISKA CHARMAZEL WELL NOW IT APPEARS THAT IN ONE PART OF THIS FRESCO THE SCENE DEPICTED
6484-69655-0033 HIS HEART BEAT THICKLY AS THOUGH THE DOCTOR WERE TELLING HIM OF SOME HORRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH HE HAD AN ACTIVE PART WHEREAS HE HAD TRULY NO INTEREST AT ALL IN THE MATTER EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS EVENTS OF HISTORY ARE MORE OR LESS INTERESTING TO EVERYONE
6484-69655-0034 WELL HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE WELL ECHOED DOCTOR DEAN THERE IS REALLY NOTHING MORE TO SAY BEYOND THAT I WANT TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING I CAN CONCERNING THIS ARAXES
6484-69655-0035 IF ONLY FOR THE REASON THAT THE CHARMING PRINCESS CHOSE TO IMPERSONATE HIS LADY LOVE LAST NIGHT ONE MUST AMUSE ONE'S SELF IN ONE'S OWN FASHION EVEN IN EGYPT AND THIS AMUSES ME
6484-69655-0036 COME HE SAID BRIEFLY I WILL SHOW YOU MY PICTURE HE STRAIGHTENED HIS TALL FINE FIGURE AND WALKED SLOWLY ACROSS THE ROOM TO THE TABLE WHERE DENZIL MURRAY SAT WITH HIS SISTER AND FRIENDS

6484-69655-0041 WITH A TINGE OF MELANCHOLY REGRET IN HIS EYES IT IS EVIDENT MADEMOISELLE HELEN DOES NOT LIKE THE PRINCESS ZISKA HE OBSERVED OH WELL AS TO THAT SAID FULKEWARD HASTILY
6484-69655-0042 YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T EXPECT WOMEN TO LOSE THEIR HEADS ABOUT HER AS MEN DO BESIDE THERE'S SOMETHING RATHER STRANGE IN THE PRINCESS'S MANNER AND APPEARANCE AND PERHAPS MISS MURRAY DOESN'T TAKE TO HER ANY MORE THAN I DO
6484-69655-0043 OH THEN YOU ARE NOT ONE OF HER LOVERS QUERIED DOCTOR DEAN SMILING NO ARE YOU I GOOD HEAVENS MY DEAR YOUNG SIR I WAS NEVER IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN IN MY LIFE THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL IN LOVE
6484-69655-0044 AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN I WROTE VERSES TO A MATURE YOUNG DAMSEL OF FORTY A WOMAN WITH A REMARKABLY FINE FIGURE AND PLENTY OF IT SHE REJECTED MY ADVANCES WITH SCORN AND I HAVE NEVER LOVED SINCE
6484-69655-0045 THEY ALL LAUGHED EVEN DENZIL MURRAY'S SULLEN FEATURES CLEARED FOR THE MOMENT INTO THE BRIGHTNESS OF A SMILE WHERE DID YOU PAINT THE PRINCESS'S PICTURE INQUIRED ROSS COURTNEY SUDDENLY

6484-69655-0048 BUT IT HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF A LONG FRENCH WINDOW WHICH OPENED OUT INTO THE GARDEN HERE ON AN EASEL WAS A CANVAS WITH ITS BACK TURNED TOWARDS THE SPECTATOR
6484-69655-0049 AND BE PREPARED FOR A CURIOSITY UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE HE PAUSED A MOMENT LOOKING STEADILY AT DOCTOR DEAN
6484-69655-0050 YOU MAY BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN HOW I GOT SUCH A FACE ON MY CANVAS FOR I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT TO MYSELF
