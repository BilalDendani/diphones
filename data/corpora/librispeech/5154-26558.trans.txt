5154-26558-0000 PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW IT BUT THE MONKEYS THINK THAT ALL THE BANANAS BELONG TO THEM WHEN BRAZILIAN CHILDREN EAT BANANAS THEY SAY I AM A MONKEY I ONCE KNEW A LITTLE BOY IN BRAZIL WHO WAS VERY VERY FOND OF BANANAS
5154-26558-0001 HE ALWAYS SAID I AM VERY MUCH OF A MONKEY IF YOU ARE FOND OF BANANAS THE BRAZILIAN CHILDREN WOULD TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE A MONKEY TOO THIS IS THE STORY THEY TELL TO SHOW US HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT
5154-26558-0002 ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WORLD HAD JUST BEEN MADE AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE KIND OF BANANA BUT VERY MANY KINDS OF MONKEYS THERE WAS A LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD A BIG GARDEN FULL OF BANANA TREES
5154-26558-0003 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE OLD WOMAN TO GATHER THE BANANAS HERSELF SO SHE MADE A BARGAIN WITH THE LARGEST MONKEY SHE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WOULD GATHER THE BUNCHES OF BANANAS FOR HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM HALF OF THEM THE MONKEY GATHERED THE BANANAS
5154-26558-0004 WHEN HE TOOK HIS HALF HE GAVE THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN THE BANANAS WHICH GROW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BUNCH AND ARE SMALL AND WRINKLED THE NICE BIG FAT ONES HE KEPT FOR HIMSELF AND CARRIED THEM HOME TO LET THEM RIPEN IN THE DARK
5154-26558-0005 THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WAS VERY ANGRY SHE LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF SOME WAY BY WHICH SHE COULD GET EVEN WITH THE MONKEY AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF A TRICK
5154-26558-0006 THE NEXT MORNING SHE MADE AN IMAGE OF WAX WHICH LOOKED JUST LIKE A LITTLE BLACK BOY THEN SHE PLACED A LARGE FLAT BASKET ON THE TOP OF THE IMAGE'S HEAD AND IN THE BASKET
5154-26558-0007 AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE BIGGEST MONKEY PASSED THAT WAY HE SAW THE IMAGE OF WAX AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A BOY PEDDLING BANANAS HE HAD OFTEN PUSHED OVER BOY BANANA PEDDLERS UPSET THEIR BASKETS AND THEN HAD RUN AWAY WITH THE BANANAS
5154-26558-0008 THIS MORNING HE WAS FEELING VERY GOOD NATURED
5154-26558-0009 THE IMAGE OF WAX ANSWERED NEVER A WORD AGAIN THE MONKEY SAID THIS TIME IN A LITTLE LOUDER VOICE O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY PLEASE GIVE ME A BANANA JUST ONE LITTLE RIPE LITTLE
5154-26558-0010 SWEET LITTLE BANANA THE IMAGE OF WAX ANSWERED NEVER A WORD THEN THE MONKEY CALLED OUT IN HIS LOUDEST VOICE O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME A BANANA I'LL GIVE YOU SUCH A PUSH THAT IT WILL UPSET
5154-26558-0011 THE IMAGE OF WAX WAS SILENT THE MONKEY RAN TOWARD THE IMAGE OF WAX AND STRUCK IT HARD WITH HIS HAND HIS HAND REMAINED FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN THE WAX O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY LET GO MY HAND
5154-26558-0012 THE MONKEY CALLED OUT LET GO MY HAND AND GIVE ME A BANANA OR ELSE I'LL GIVE YOU A HARD HARD BLOW WITH MY OTHER HAND THE IMAGE OF WAX DID NOT LET GO THE MONKEY GAVE THE IMAGE A HARD HARD BLOW WITH HIS OTHER HAND
5154-26558-0013 THE OTHER HAND REMAINED FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN THE WAX THEN THE MONKEY CALLED OUT O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY LET GO MY TWO HANDS LET GO MY TWO HANDS AND GIVE ME A BANANA OR ELSE I WILL GIVE YOU A KICK WITH MY FOOT THE IMAGE OF WAX

5154-26558-0015 LET GO MY FOOT LET GO MY TWO HANDS AND MY FOOT
5154-26558-0016 THE IMAGE OF WAX DID NOT LET GO THEN THE MONKEY
5154-26558-0017 DID NOT LET GO THEN THE MONKEY MADE SUCH AN UPROAR WITH HIS CRIES AND SHOUTS THAT VERY SOON MONKEYS CAME RUNNING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WERE BIG MONKEYS AND LITTLE MONKEYS AND MIDDLE SIZED MONKEYS
5154-26558-0018 A WHOLE ARMY OF MONKEYS HAD COME TO THE AID OF THE BIGGEST MONKEY IT WAS THE VERY LITTLEST MONKEY WHO THOUGHT OF A PLAN TO HELP THE BIGGEST MONKEY OUT OF HIS PLIGHT
5154-26558-0019 THE MONKEYS WERE TO CLIMB UP INTO THE BIGGEST TREE AND PILE THEMSELVES ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER UNTIL THEY MADE A PYRAMID OF MONKEYS THE MONKEY WITH THE VERY LOUDEST VOICE OF ALL WAS TO BE ON TOP
5154-26558-0020 AND HE WAS TO SHOUT HIS VERY LOUDEST TO THE SUN AND ASK THE SUN TO COME AND HELP THE BIGGEST MONKEY OUT OF HIS DREADFUL DIFFICULTY THIS IS WHAT ALL THE BIG SIZED LITTLE SIZED MIDDLE SIZED MONKEYS DID
5154-26558-0021 THE MONKEY WITH THE LOUDEST VOICE ON TOP OF THE PYRAMID MADE THE SUN HEAR THE SUN CAME AT ONCE THE SUN POURED HIS HOTTEST RAYS DOWN UPON THE WAX
5154-26558-0022 THE MONKEY WAS AT LAST ABLE TO PULL OUT ONE OF HIS HANDS THE SUN POURED DOWN MORE OF HIS HOTTEST RAYS AND SOON THE MONKEY WAS ABLE TO PULL OUT HIS TWO HANDS THEN HE COULD PULL OUT ONE FOOT THEN ANOTHER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE HIS BODY TOO
5154-26558-0023 AT LAST HE WAS FREE WHEN THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED
5154-26558-0024 SHE DECIDED TO MOVE TO ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD WHERE SHE RAISED CABBAGES INSTEAD OF BANANAS THE MONKEYS WERE LEFT IN POSSESSION OF THE BIG GARDEN FULL OF BANANA TREES
