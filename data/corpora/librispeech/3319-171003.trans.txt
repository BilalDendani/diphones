3319-171003-0000 SUCKLING'S AGLAURA IT WAS FRIDAY AND THE NEXT MORNING WAS THE WHEN THE REPORTS WERE TO BE PRESENTED SCHOOL HAD CLOSED AND ALL BUT ELSIE HAD ALREADY LEFT THE ROOM
3319-171003-0001 FOR SHE WAS VERY NEAT AND ORDERLY IN HER HABITS WHEN SHE HAD QUITE FINISHED HER WORK SHE TOOK UP HER REPORT BOOK AND GLANCED OVER IT AS HER EYE RESTED FOR AN INSTANT UPON THE ONE BAD MARK SHE SIGHED A LITTLE AND MURMURED TO HERSELF I AM SO SORRY
3319-171003-0002 I WISH PAPA KNEW HOW LITTLE I REALLY DESERVED IT I DON'T KNOW WHY I NEVER CAN GET THE COURAGE TO TELL HIM THEN LAYING IT ASIDE SHE OPENED HER COPY BOOK AND TURNED OVER THE LEAVES WITH UNALLOYED PLEASURE FOR NOT ONE OF ITS PAGES WAS DEFACED BY A SINGLE BLOT
3319-171003-0003 AND FROM BEGINNING TO END IT GAVE EVIDENCE OF PAINSTAKING CAREFULNESS AND DECIDED IMPROVEMENT AH SURELY THIS WILL PLEASE DEAR PAPA SHE EXCLAIMED HALF ALOUD HOW GOOD AUNT ADELAIDE WAS TO SIT HERE WITH ME
3319-171003-0004 THEN PUTTING IT CAREFULLY IN ITS PLACE SHE CLOSED AND LOCKED THE DESK
3319-171003-0005 NOW IT SO HAPPENED THAT AFTERNOON THAT ARTHUR WHO HAD MADE HIMSELF SICK BY OVER INDULGENCE IN SWEETMEATS AND HAD IN CONSEQUENCE BEEN LOUNGING ABOUT THE HOUSE DOING NOTHING FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO REMAINED AT HOME WHILE ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE OUT WALKING RIDING OR VISITING
3319-171003-0006 HE WAS NOT USUALLY VERY FOND OF READING
3319-171003-0007 IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT A BOOK HE HAD SEEN ELSIE READING THAT MORNING TO BE SURE THE BOOK BELONGED TO HER AND SHE WAS NOT THERE TO BE CONSULTED AS TO HER WILLINGNESS TO LEND IT BUT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO ARTHUR WHO HAD VERY LITTLE RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY
3319-171003-0008 EXCEPTING WHERE HIS OWN WERE CONCERNED ELSIE HE KNEW WAS OUT AND CHLOE IN THE KITCHEN SO FEELING CERTAIN THERE WOULD BE NO ONE TO INTERFERE WITH HIM HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM TO LOOK FOR THE BOOK HE SOON FOUND IT LYING ON THE MANTEL BUT THE DESK KEY LAY RIGHT BESIDE IT
3319-171003-0009 AND AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THAT HE GAVE A HALF SCREAM OF DELIGHT FOR HE GUESSED AT ONCE TO WHAT LOCK IT BELONGED AND FELT THAT HE NOW COULD ACCOMPLISH THE REVENGE HE HAD PLOTTED EVER SINCE THE AFFAIR OF THE WATCH HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE IT
3319-171003-0010 BUT DREW IT BACK AGAIN AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT BALANCING IN HIS MIND THE CHANCES OF DETECTION HE COULD DEFACE ELSIE'S COPY BOOK BUT ADELAIDE COULD TESTIFY TO THE LITTLE GIRL'S CAREFULNESS AND THE NEATNESS OF HER WORK UP TO THAT VERY DAY FOR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL ROOM THAT MORNING DURING THE WRITING HOUR
3319-171003-0011 BUT THEN ADELAIDE HAD JUST LEFT HOME TO PAY A VISIT TO A FRIEND LIVING AT SOME DISTANCE
3319-171003-0012 MISS DAY TO BE SURE KNEW THE APPEARANCE OF ELSIE'S BOOK QUITE AS WELL BUT THERE WAS STILL LESS DANGER OF HER INTERFERENCE
3319-171003-0013 SO HE DECIDED TO RUN THE RISK AND LAYING DOWN THE BOOK HE TOOK THE KEY WENT TO THE DOOR LOOKED CAREFULLY UP AND DOWN THE HALL TO MAKE SURE OF NOT BEING SEEN BY ANY OF THE SERVANTS AND HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF ON THAT POINT HURRIED TO THE SCHOOL ROOM UNLOCKED ELSIE'S DESK TOOK OUT HER COPY BOOK
3319-171003-0014 PROCEEDED DELIBERATELY TO BLOT NEARLY EVERY PAGE IN IT ON SOME HE MADE A LARGE BLOT ON OTHERS A SMALL ONE AND ON SOME TWO OR THREE AND ALSO SCRIBBLED BETWEEN THE LINES AND ON THE MARGIN SO AS COMPLETELY TO DEFACE POOR ELSIE'S WORK
3319-171003-0015 BUT TO DO ARTHUR JUSTICE THOUGH HE KNEW HIS BROTHER WOULD BE PRETTY SURE TO BE VERY ANGRY WITH ELSIE HE DID NOT KNOW OF THE THREATENED PUNISHMENT HE STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE AS HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A FOOTSTEP AND SHUT DOWN THE LID UNTIL IT HAD PASSED WHEN HE RAISED IT AGAIN AND WENT ON WITH HIS WICKED WORK
3319-171003-0016 IT DID NOT TAKE LONG HOWEVER AND HE SOON REPLACED THE COPY BOOK IN THE PRECISE SPOT IN WHICH HE HAD FOUND IT WIPED THE PEN AND PUT IT CAREFULLY BACK IN ITS PLACE RELOCKED THE DESK HURRIED BACK TO ELSIE'S ROOM PUT THE KEY JUST WHERE HE HAD FOUND IT AND TAKING THE BOOK
3319-171003-0017 RETURNED TO THE NURSERY WITHOUT HAVING MET ANY ONE HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON A COUCH AND TRIED TO READ BUT IN VAIN HE COULD NOT FIX HIS ATTENTION UPON THE PAGE
3319-171003-0018 AND ITS PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES AND NOW WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE HE MORE THAN HALF REPENTED YET AS TO CONFESSING AND THUS SAVING ELSIE FROM UNMERITED BLAME HE DID NOT FOR A SINGLE MOMENT ENTERTAIN THE THOUGHT
3319-171003-0019 BUT AT LENGTH IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE HAD BEEN INTO ELSIE'S ROOM TO GET THE BOOK HE MIGHT BE SUSPECTED AND HE STARTED UP WITH THE INTENTION OF REPLACING IT BUT HE FOUND THAT IT WAS TOO LATE SHE HAD ALREADY RETURNED FOR HE HEARD HER VOICE IN THE HALL
3319-171003-0020 SO HE LAY DOWN AGAIN AND KEPT THE BOOK UNTIL SHE CAME IN SEARCH OF IT HE LOOKED VERY GUILTY AS THE LITTLE GIRL CAME IN BUT NOT SEEMING TO NOTICE IT SHE MERELY SAID I AM LOOKING FOR MY BOOK I THOUGHT PERHAPS SOME ONE MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT IT IN HERE OH YOU HAVE IT ARTHUR
3319-171003-0021 WELL KEEP IT IF YOU WISH I CAN READ IT JUST AS WELL ANOTHER TIME HERE TAKE IT SAID HE ROUGHLY PUSHING IT TOWARD HER
3319-171003-0022 BUT IF YOU DON'T CARE TO I WILL TAKE IT YOUNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAID THE GOVERNESS AS THEY WERE ABOUT CLOSING THEIR EXERCISES THE NEXT MORNING THIS IS THE REGULAR DAY FOR THE REPORTS AND THEY ARE ALL MADE OUT
3319-171003-0023 ELSIE OBEYED NOT WITHOUT SOME TREMBLING YET HOPING AS THERE WAS BUT ONE BAD MARK IN THE REPORT AND THE COPY BOOK SHOWED SUCH EVIDENT MARKS OF CARE AND PAINSTAKING HER PAPA WOULD NOT BE VERY SERIOUSLY DISPLEASED
3319-171003-0024 IT BEING THE LAST DAY OF THE TERM THE EXERCISES OF THE MORNING HAD VARIED SOMEWHAT FROM THE USUAL ROUTINE AND THE WRITING HOUR HAD BEEN ENTIRELY OMITTED THUS IT HAPPENED THAT ELSIE HAD NOT OPENED HER COPY BOOK AND WAS IN CONSEQUENCE STILL IN IGNORANCE OF ITS SADLY ALTERED APPEARANCE
3319-171003-0025 SHE FOUND HER FATHER IN HIS ROOM HE TOOK THE REPORT FIRST FROM HER HAND AND GLANCING OVER IT SAID WITH A SLIGHT FROWN I SEE YOU HAVE ONE VERY BAD MARK FOR RECITATION BUT AS THERE IS ONLY ONE AND THE OTHERS ARE REMARKABLY GOOD I WILL EXCUSE IT
3319-171003-0026 THEN TAKING THE COPY BOOK AND OPENING IT MUCH TO ELSIE'S SURPRISE AND ALARM HE GAVE HER A GLANCE OF GREAT DISPLEASURE TURNED RAPIDLY OVER THE LEAVES THEN LAYING IT DOWN SAID IN HIS STERNEST TONES I SEE I SHALL HAVE TO KEEP MY PROMISE ELSIE
3319-171003-0027 WHAT PAPA SHE ASKED TURNING PALE WITH TERROR WHAT SAID HE DO YOU ASK ME WHAT DID I NOT TELL YOU POSITIVELY THAT I WOULD PUNISH YOU IF YOUR COPY BOOK THIS MONTH DID NOT PRESENT A BETTER APPEARANCE THAN IT DID LAST O PAPA DOES IT NOT
3319-171003-0028 NO BLOTS SAID HE WHAT DO YOU CALL THESE AND HE TURNED OVER THE LEAVES AGAIN HOLDING THE BOOK SO THAT SHE COULD SEE THEM AND SHOWING THAT ALMOST EVERY ONE WAS BLOTTED IN SEVERAL PLACES ELSIE GAZED AT THEM IN UNFEIGNED ASTONISHMENT
3319-171003-0029 THEN LOOKING UP INTO HIS FACE SHE SAID EARNESTLY BUT FEARFULLY PAPA I DID NOT DO IT WHO DID THEN HE ASKED INDEED PAPA I DO NOT KNOW SHE REPLIED I MUST INQUIRE INTO THIS BUSINESS HE SAID RISING
3319-171003-0030 AND IF IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT YOU SHALL NOT BE PUNISHED BUT IF I FIND YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING ME A FALSEHOOD ELSIE I SHALL PUNISH YOU MUCH MORE SEVERELY THAN IF YOU HAD NOT DENIED YOUR FAULT AND TAKING HER BY THE HAND AS HE SPOKE HE LED HER BACK TO THE SCHOOL ROOM MISS DAY SAID HE SHOWING THE BOOK
3319-171003-0031 ELSIE SAYS THESE BLOTS ARE NOT HER WORK CAN YOU TELL ME WHOSE THEY ARE MISS ELSIE GENERALLY TELLS THE TRUTH SIR REPLIED MISS DAY SARCASTICALLY BUT I MUST SAY THAT IN THIS INSTANCE I THINK SHE HAS FAILED AS HER DESK HAS A GOOD LOCK AND SHE HERSELF KEEPS THE KEY

3319-171003-0035 SHE HASTILY CROSSED THE ROOM AND SPEAKING IN A LOW TONE SAID ARTHUR YOU HAVE HAD A HAND IN THIS BUSINESS I VERY WELL KNOW NOW CONFESS IT QUICKLY OR HORACE WILL HALF KILL ELSIE YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID HE DOGGEDLY
3319-171003-0036 YES I DO SHE ANSWERED AND IF YOU DO NOT SPEAK OUT AT ONCE I SHALL SAVE ELSIE AND FIND MEANS TO PROVE YOUR GUILT AFTERWARDS
3319-171003-0037 SEEING IT WAS USELESS TO TRY TO MOVE HIM LORA TURNED AWAY AND HURRIED TO HORACE'S ROOM WHICH IN HER HASTE SHE ENTERED WITHOUT KNOCKING HE HAVING FORTUNATELY NEGLECTED TO FASTEN THE DOOR SHE WAS JUST IN TIME HE HAD A SMALL RIDING WHIP IN HIS HAND
3319-171003-0038 AND ELSIE STOOD BESIDE HIM PALE AS DEATH TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED EVEN TO CRY AND TREMBLING SO THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY STAND HE TURNED AN ANGRY GLANCE ON HIS SISTER AS SHE ENTERED BUT TAKING NO NOTICE OF IT SHE EXCLAIMED EAGERLY HORACE

3319-171003-0081 ARTHUR KNOWING THIS TO BE THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
3319-171003-0082 WAS BEGINNING TO BE A GOOD DEAL FEARFUL OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS MISCONDUCT AND NOT WITHOUT REASON FOR HIS BROTHER'S WRATH WAS NOW FULLY AROUSED AND HE WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BOY SHOULD NOT ON THIS OCCASION ESCAPE THE PENALTY OF HIS MISDEEDS
3319-171003-0083 ARTHUR WAS ALREADY IN THE DINING ROOM WHEN MISTER DINSMORE CAME DOWN
