1084-139230-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR THE BARGAIN IT MAY BE THAT WHEN ONE IS PLACED IN SUCH A PREDICAMENT AS THAT IN WHICH I THEN FOUND MYSELF ONE'S WITS ARE SUDDENLY SHARPENED AND A NEW SENSE IS GIVEN TO ONE
1084-139230-0001 WHETHER THAT IS SO OR NOT I WAS AS CERTAIN AS IF I ACTUALLY SAW HIM THAT MY ASSAILANT WAS THE BUTLER HOLLINS AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFINITELY SURPRISED IF ANY OTHER VOICE THAN HIS HAD SPOKEN
1084-139230-0002 AS HE DID SPEAK WHEN THE LAST GRUMBLE OF THE THUNDER DIED OUT IN A SULKY RELUCTANT MURMUR IN AT THAT DOOR AND STRAIGHT UP THE STAIRS MONEYLAWS HE COMMANDED AND QUICK
1084-139230-0003 LIVELY NOW HE TRAILED THE MUZZLE OF THE REVOLVER ROUND FROM MY TEMPLE TO THE BACK OF MY HEAD AS HE SPOKE PRESSING IT INTO MY HAIR IN ITS COURSE IN A FASHION THAT WAS ANYTHING BUT REASSURING
1084-139230-0004 AND HOW I WAS FOR IT'S A FACT MORE CURIOUS THAN FRIGHTENED ABOUT IT BUT THE SENSE OF SELF PRESERVATION WAS ON ME SELF ASSERTIVE ENOUGH AND I OBLIGED HIM STUMBLING IN AT THE DOOR UNDER THE PRESSURE OF HIS STRONG ARM AND
1084-139230-0005 OF THE REVOLVER AND BEGINNING TO BOGGLE AT THE FIRST STEPS OLD AND MUCH WORN ONES WHICH WERE DEEPLY HOLLOWED IN THE MIDDLE HE SHOVED ME FORWARD UP YOU GO HE SAID STRAIGHT AHEAD PUT YOUR ARMS UP AND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU TILL YOU FEEL A DOOR
1084-139230-0006 PUSH IT OPEN HE KEPT ONE HAND ON THE SCRUFF OF MY NECK TOO TIGHTLY FOR COMFORT AND WITH THE OTHER PRESSED THE REVOLVER INTO THE CAVITY JUST ABOVE IT AND IN THIS FASHION WE WENT UP AND EVEN IN THAT PREDICAMENT I MUST HAVE HAD MY WITS ABOUT ME
1084-139230-0007 FOR I COUNTED TWO AND TWENTY STEPS

1084-139230-0010 AND SUDDENLY I HEARD A SNAP BEHIND ME AND THE PLACE IN WHICH WE STOOD WAS LIGHTED UP FEEBLY BUT ENOUGH TO SHOW ME A CELL LIKE SORT OF ROOM STONE WALLED OF COURSE AND DESTITUTE OF EVERYTHING IN THE FURNISHING WAY
1084-139230-0011 IN ITS BLUE GLARE HE DREW THE REVOLVER AWAY FROM MY HEAD AND STEPPING ASIDE BUT ALWAYS COVERING ME WITH HIS WEAPON MOTIONED ME TO THE FURTHER STOOL I OBEYED HIM MECHANICALLY
1084-139230-0012 SAT DOWN ON THE OTHER STOOL AND RESTING HIS ELBOW ON THE TABLE LEDGE POKED THE REVOLVER WITHIN A FEW INCHES OF MY NOSE NOW WE'LL TALK FOR A FEW MINUTES MONEYLAWS HE SAID QUIETLY
1084-139230-0013 AND I'D HAVE BEEN OFF NOW IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOUR CURSED PEEPING AND PRYING BUT I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU UNLESS I'M OBLIGED TO

1084-139230-0019 I THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE DROPPED THE MUZZLE OF THE REVOLVER AT THAT BUT HE STILL KEPT IT IN A LINE WITH MY NOSE AND MADE NO SIGN OF RELAXING HIS VIGILANCE BUT AS HE WAS SILENT FOR THE MOMENT I LET OUT A QUESTION AT HIM

1084-139230-0043 AND STILL KEEPING UP THE REVOLVER AND FROM A DRAWER IN THE TABLE
1084-139230-0044 THERE'S A DOOR BEHIND YOU IN YON CORNER HE SAID AND YOU'LL FIND A LANTERN AT ITS FOOT YOU'VE MATCHES ON YOU NO DOUBT AND BEYOND THE DOOR THERE'S ANOTHER STAIR THAT LEADS UP TO THE TURRET

1084-139230-0046 TURNED TO THAT BY WHICH HE HAD ENTERED AND AS HE TURNED HE SNAPPED OFF THE LIGHT OF HIS ELECTRIC LAMP WHILE I MYSELF
1084-139230-0047 IN ITS SPLUTTERING LIGHT I SAW HIS BIG FIGURE ROUND THE CORNER THEN JUST AS I MADE FOR THE LANTERN THE MATCH WENT OUT AND ALL WAS DARKNESS AGAIN
1084-139230-0048 AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A SORT OF SCUFFLE AND HE CRIED OUT LOUDLY ONCE AND THERE WAS THE SOUND OF A FALL AND THEN OF LIGHTER STEPS HURRYING AWAY AND THEN A HEAVY RATTLING GROAN
1084-139230-0049 AND WITH MY HEART IN MY MOUTH AND FINGERS TREMBLING SO THAT I COULD SCARCELY HOLD THE MATCH I MADE SHIFT TO LIGHT THE CANDLE IN THE LANTERN AND WENT FEARFULLY AFTER HIM THERE
1084-139230-0050 WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING IN DARK STREAMS FROM A GAP IN HIS THROAT WHILE HIS HANDS WHICH HE HAD INSTINCTIVELY PUT UP TO IT WERE FEEBLY DROPPING AWAY AND RELAXING ON HIS BROAD CHEST
1084-139230-0051 AND AS I PUT THE LANTERN CLOSER TO HIM HE LOOKED UP AT ME IN A QUEER PUZZLED FASHION
