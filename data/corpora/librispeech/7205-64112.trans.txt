7205-64112-0000 OF ALL WHO ASSISTED AT THE CEREMONY OF MARY MORGAN'S FUNERAL NO ONE SEEMED SO IMPATIENT FOR ITS TERMINATION AS THE PRIEST
7205-64112-0001 BURYING GROUND AND INTO HIS OWN HOUSE NEAR BY SUCH HASTE WOULD HAVE APPEARED STRANGE
7205-64112-0002 ARRIVING THERE THE CHARON ATTENDANT ROWS HIM ACROSS THE RIVER
7205-64112-0003 ALONG THIS HE GOES RAPIDLY AS HIS LEGS CAN CARRY HIM IN A WALK CLERICAL DIGNITY HINDERS HIM FROM PROCEEDING AT A RUN THOUGH JUDGING BY THE EXPRESSION OF HIS COUNTENANCE HE IS INCLINED TO IT
7205-64112-0004 THE ROUTE HE IS ON WOULD CONDUCT TO LLANGORREN COURT SEVERAL MILES DISTANT AND THITHER IS HE BOUND
7205-64112-0005 HE DOES NOT VISIT NOR WOULD IT SERVE HIM TO SHOW HIS FACE THERE LEAST OF ALL TO GWEN WYNN
7205-64112-0006 AND IS NOW ON THE WAY FOR IT PRETTY SURE OF BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH HIS OBJECT TRUE TO HER FASHIONABLE INSTINCTS AND TOILETTE NECESSITIES MISS LINTON KEEPS A FRENCH MAID
7205-64112-0007 AND THROUGH HER AIDED BY THE CONFESSION KEPT ADVISED OF EVERYTHING WHICH TRANSPIRES AT THE COURT OR ALL HE DEEMS IT WORTH WHILE TO BE ADVISED ABOUT
7205-64112-0008 HIS CONFIDENCE THAT HE WILL NOT HAVE LONG HIS WALK FOR NOTHING RESTS ON CERTAIN MATTERS OF PRE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE FOREIGN DOMESTIC HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING A CODE OF SIGNALS BY WHICH HE CAN COMMUNICATE
7205-64112-0009 WITH ALMOST A CERTAINTY OF BEING ABLE TO SEE HER NOT INSIDE THE HOUSE BUT AT A PLACE NEAR ENOUGH TO BE CONVENIENT RARE THE PARK IN HEREFORDSHIRE THROUGH WHICH THERE IS NOT A RIGHT OF WAY PATH AND ONE RUNS ACROSS THAT OF LLANGORREN
7205-64112-0010 ALL THE WAY THROUGH TREES THAT SCREEN IT FROM VIEW OF THE HOUSE THERE IS A POINT HOWEVER WHERE IT APPROACHES THE EDGE OF THE WOOD AND THERE ONE TRAVERSING IT MIGHT BE SEEN FROM THE UPPER WINDOWS
7205-64112-0011 BUT ONLY FOR AN INSTANT UNLESS THE PARTY SO PASSING SHOULD CHOOSE TO MAKE STOP IN THE PLACE EXPOSED IT IS A THOROUGHFARE NOT MUCH FREQUENTED THOUGH FREE TO FATHER ROGIER AS ANY ONE ELSE AND NOW HASTENING ALONG IT
7205-64112-0012 HE ARRIVES AT THAT SPOT WHERE THE BREAK IN THE TIMBER BRINGS THE HOUSE IN VIEW HERE HE MAKES A HALT
7205-64112-0013 HE DRAWS BACK TO THE PATH AND SITS DOWN UPON A STILE CLOSE BY
7205-64112-0014 HIS HASTE HITHERTO EXPLAINED BY THE FACT ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES ARE HIS SIGNALS LIKELY TO BE SEEN OR COULD THEY BE ATTENDED TO ONE OF THE SUREST AND SAFEST IS DURING THE EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS JUST AFTER LUNCHEON
7205-64112-0015 WHEN THE ANCIENT TOAST OF CHELTENHAM TAKES HER ACCUSTOMED SIESTA BEFORE DRESSING HERSELF FOR THE DRIVE OR RECEPTION OF CALLERS WHILE THE MISTRESS SLEEPS THE MAID IS FREE TO DISPOSE OF HERSELF AS SHE PLEASES
7205-64112-0016 IT WAS TO HIT THIS INTERLUDE OF LEISURE FATHER ROGIER HAS BEEN HURRYING
7205-64112-0017 RECOGNISABLE AS THAT OF THE FEMME DE CHAMBRE GLIDING THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY AND EVIDENTLY WITH AN EYE TO ESCAPE OBSERVATION SHE IS ONLY VISIBLE AT INTERVALS
7205-64112-0018 BUT HE KNOWS SHE WILL TURN UP AGAIN AND SHE DOES
7205-64112-0019 YOU'VE BEEN PROMPT I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU QUITE SO SOON MADAME LA CHATELAINE OBLIVIOUS I APPREHEND IN THE MIDST OF HER AFTERNOON NAP
7205-64112-0020 EARLIER THAN USUAL SO I MUST GET BACK IMMEDIATELY
7205-64112-0021 WHEN IS IT TO BE ON THURSDAY
7205-64112-0022 IT IS TO BE A GRAND FETE AS YOU SAY THEY'VE BEEN ALL LAST WEEK PREPARING FOR IT AMONG THE INVITED LE CAPITAINE RYECROFT I PRESUME O YES
7205-64112-0023 I SAW MADAME WRITE THE NOTE INVITING HIM INDEED TOOK IT MYSELF DOWN TO THE HALL TABLE FOR THE POST BOY HE VISITS OFTEN AT THE COURT OF LATE VERY OFTEN ONCE A WEEK SOMETIMES TWICE AND COMES DOWN THE RIVER BY BOAT DOESN'T HE
7205-64112-0024 IN A BOAT YES COMES AND GOES THAT WAY HER STATEMENT IS RELIABLE AS FATHER ROGIER HAS REASON TO BELIEVE HAVING AN INKLING OF SUSPICION THAT THE DAMSEL HAS OF LATE BEEN CASTING SHEEP'S EYES NOT AT CAPTAIN RYECROFT
7205-64112-0025 BUT HIS YOUNG BOATMAN AND IS AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MARY AS EITHER THE BOAT'S OWNER OR CHARTERER ALWAYS COMES BY WATER AND RETURNS BY IT OBSERVES THE PRIEST AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF YOU'RE QUITE SURE OF THAT MA FILLE
7205-64112-0026 MADEMOISELLE APPEARS TO BE VERY PARTIAL TO HIM I THINK YOU TOLD ME SHE OFTEN ACCOMPANIES HIM DOWN TO THE BOAT STAIR AT HIS DEPARTURE OFTEN
7205-64112-0027 EITHER THE BOAT STAIR OR THE PAVILION
7205-64112-0028 THEY HOLD THEIR TETE A TETE THERE AT TIMES DO THEY YES THEY DO BUT NOT WHEN HE LEAVES AT A LATE HOUR AS FOR INSTANCE WHEN HE DINES AT THE COURT
7205-64112-0029 AND WHY SHOULDN'T SHE PERE ROGIER IS THERE ANY HARM IN IT
7205-64112-0030 WHICH TO SAY TRUTH HE NEVER HAS OH NO ANSWERS THE PRIEST WITH AN ASSUMED INDIFFERENCE NO HARM WHATEVER AND NO BUSINESS OF OURS
7205-64112-0031 AND WHOM WE'VE JUST THIS DAY INTERRED I SUPPOSE YOU'VE HEARD NO I HAVEN'T
7205-64112-0032 HER QUESTION MAY APPEAR STRANGE RUGG'S FERRY BEING SO NEAR TO LLANGORREN COURT AND ABERGANN STILL NEARER BUT FOR REASONS ALREADY STATED AS OTHERS THE IGNORANCE OF THE FRENCHWOMAN AS TO WHAT HAS OCCURRED AT THE FARMHOUSE IS NOT ONLY INTELLIGIBLE
