5217-24510-0000 ON THE COAST OF EGYPT LIES ALEXANDRIA A BUSY AND PROSPEROUS CITY OF TO DAY YOU REMEMBER THE GREAT CONQUEROR ALEXANDER
5217-24510-0001 AND HOW NATION AFTER NATION HAD BEEN FORCED TO SUBMIT TO HIM UNTIL ALL THE THEN KNOWN WORLD OWNED HIM FOR ITS EMPEROR HE BUILT THIS CITY AND CALLED IT AFTER HIS OWN NAME ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE DAYS OF ANTIOCHUS
5217-24510-0002 OF WHOM WE READ IN OUR LAST CHAPTER A COMPANY OF JEWS WERE LIVING IN ALEXANDRIA THEN A RICH AND BEAUTIFUL CITY WITH ITS STATELY PALACES AND TEMPLES OF WHITE MARBLE ITS BEAUTIFUL GARDENS AND GROVES OF GRACEFUL PALM TREES
5217-24510-0003 AFTER THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER THE GREEK KINGS OF EGYPT DELIGHTED TO LIVE IN THE NEW CITY
5217-24510-0004 BUT AS GOOD SUBJECTS AND CITIZENS BY THE GREEK RULERS OF EGYPT AND THEREFORE AS THE YEARS PASSED THEY GREW RICH AND HONOURED IN THEIR BEAUTIFUL HOME THEIR CHILDREN HOWEVER SELDOM IF EVER HEARD HEBREW SPOKEN FOR ALL THE JEWS OF ALEXANDRIA
5217-24510-0005 FOR CONVENIENCE SAKE SPOKE GREEK LIKE THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT ALTHOUGH THESE JEWS LIVED IN A HEATHEN CITY WHERE THEY READ NOTHING BUT GREEK BOOKS AND HEARD GREEK SPOKEN ALL DAY LONG THEY DID NOT FORGET THEIR GOD
5217-24510-0006 THEY LONGED AS EARNESTLY AS EVER TO HEAR ABOUT HIM AND TO READ IN HIS BOOK BUT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
5217-24510-0007 THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE
5217-24510-0008 SO SAID THESE JEWISH PARENTS THIS WAS A WONDERFUL PROOF OF THE BIBLE'S LIVING POWER THE JEWS HAD CHANGED THEIR LANGUAGE AND THEIR COUNTRY THOUSANDS OF THE CLEVEREST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN WERE WITHIN THEIR REACH FOR ALEXANDRIA HAD AT THIS TIME THE LARGEST LIBRARY IN THE WORLD
5217-24510-0009 HOWEVER IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE JEWS OF ALEXANDRIA DID THE WORK ENTIRELY THEMSELVES
5217-24510-0010 SOUTH EAST AND WEST
5217-24510-0011 SEEKING THE MESSIAH AND SAYING WHERE IS HE THAT IS BORN KING OF THE JEWS
5217-24510-0012 THE BIBLE HAD INDEED TAKEN A STRONG LEAP FORWARD NOW FOR LONG CENTURIES IT HAD BEEN LIKE A TINY STREAM FLOWING THROUGH A DRY LAND AND REACHING ONLY A FEW PEOPLE
5217-24510-0013 EVER GROWING DEEPER AND WIDER GUIDED BY GOD IN ALL ITS WANDERINGS ACROSS THE EARTH THE BIBLE WAS NOW NO LONGER LOCKED UP IN A LANGUAGE WHICH WAS ALREADY HALF FORGOTTEN WITH THIS GREEK TRANSLATION ITS WORLD WIDE WORK HAD BEGUN
5217-24510-0014 BUT WHILE THE GREEK TRANSLATION OF THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES WAS BECOMING AN OPEN DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE PEOPLE OF MANY LANDS COULD DRAW NEARER TO GOD
5217-24510-0015 THE SAMARITANS HAD THEIR OWN COPIES OF THE BOOKS OF THE LAW
5217-24510-0016 THE WORLD HAD REDISCOVERED THE SAMARITAN BIBLE AT NABLOUS IN SAMARIA KNOWN IN OLD TESTAMENT TIMES AS SHECHEM A TRAVELLER WAS ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THE OLDEST SAMARITAN COPY OF THE ALTERED BOOKS OF THE LAW ITS QUEER LETTER SIGNS ARE TRACED ON PARCHMENT ROLLS
5217-24510-0017 THEY ARE KEPT IN A SILVER CYLINDER COVERED WITH CRIMSON SATIN HEAVILY EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD
5217-24510-0018 AND THEREFORE MORE CORRECT THAN THE JEWISH SCRIPTURES
5217-24510-0019 TRUE THE DISCOVERY WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR THESE DOCUMENTS PROVED BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT THE BOOK OF THE LAW DATED BACK TO A TIME WHEN THE ANCIENT FORM OF LETTERS WERE STILL IN USE AND SO THEY BORE A STRONG WITNESS TO THE GREAT AGE OF THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS OF OUR BIBLE
5217-24510-0020 A HUNDRED YEARS AGO FOR INSTANCE BOOKS WITH LONG S'S WERE PRINTED IN ENGLAND BUT THE OLD FORM OF LETTER WAS TIRESOME TO READ AND IS NOW ENTIRELY OUT OF DATE
5217-24510-0021 THEY HAD REJECTED AS WELL ALL THE FRESH LIGHT AND INSPIRATION WHICH GOD WAS CONTINUALLY GIVING TO HIS PEOPLE THROUGH THE HOLY PROPHETS
5217-24510-0022 MOSES WAS THE ONLY TRUE PROPHET THUS THEY CUT THEMSELVES ADRIFT FROM FURTHER LIGHT AND LITTLE BY LITTLE THE NATIONS HAD DWINDLED AWAY
5217-24510-0023 AND KEPT ALIVE IN THEIR HEARTS THE HOPE OF A COMING MESSIAH GOD MADE FOR THEM A WONDERFUL WAY OF ESCAPE EVERY BIBLE READER KNOWS AND LOVES THAT BEAUTIFUL SCENE BY THE WELL OF SYCHAR
5217-24510-0024 WHERE THE SAVIOUR BEGAN BY ASKING A WOMAN FOR WATER TO DRINK AND ENDED BY EXPLAINING TO HER SOME OF THE DEEPEST TRUTHS OF GOD'S KINGDOM
5217-24510-0025 AND WHY THE JEWS WOULD HAVE NO DEALINGS WITH THE SAMARITANS AS WE HAVE SEEN A GREAT BARRIER DIVIDED HER FROM ALL ORDINARY JEWISH TEACHERS SHE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO BELIEVE IN AN ALTERED BIBLE NOT MERELY A DIFFERENT TRANSLATION REMEMBER
5217-24510-0026 FOR THE BIBLE SHOULD BE THE SAME IN EVERY LANGUAGE BUT A BOOK OF THE LAW IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORDS HAD BEEN CHANGED AND THE ORIGINAL MEANING DESTROYED SO THE WOMAN SAID TO OUR LORD
