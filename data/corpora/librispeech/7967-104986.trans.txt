7967-104986-0000 CHAPTER NINE SCRAPS WE DID NOT LAUGH WE DID NOT EVEN QUESTION HER SANITY AT LEAST I DID NOT THERE WAS TOO MUCH MEANING IN HER MANNER
7967-104986-0001 A SPECTER HER HUSBAND REPEATED WITH A SUGGESTIVE GLANCE AT THE BRILLIANT SUNSHINE IN WHICH WE ALL STOOD YES THE TONE WAS ONE OF UTTER CONVICTION
7967-104986-0002 I HAD NEVER BELIEVED IN SUCH THINGS NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THEM BUT IT WAS A WEEK AGO IN THE LIBRARY I HAVE NOT SEEN A HAPPY MOMENT SINCE MY DARLING YES YES I KNOW BUT IMAGINE I WAS SITTING READING
7967-104986-0003 I HAD JUST COME FROM THE NURSERY AND THE MEMORY OF LAURA'S GOOD NIGHT KISS WAS MORE IN MY MIND THAN THE STORY I WAS FINISHING WHEN
7967-104986-0004 THE PAGE BEFORE ME SEEMED TO RECEDE AND THE WORDS FADE AWAY IN A BLUE MIST GLANCING UP I BEHELD THE OUTLINES OF A FORM BETWEEN ME AND THE LAMP WHICH A MOMENT BEFORE HAD BEEN BURNING BRIGHTLY OUTLINES HENRY I WAS CONSCIOUS OF NO SUBSTANCE
7967-104986-0005 AND THE EYES WHICH MET MINE FROM THAT SHADOWY BLOOD CURDLING SOMETHING WERE THOSE OF THE GRAVE AND MEANT A GRAVE FOR YOU OR FOR ME OH I KNOW WHAT I SAY THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THEIR LOOK AS IT BURNED INTO AND THROUGH ME
7967-104986-0006 EVERYTHING WHICH HAD GIVEN REALITY TO MY LIFE FADED AND SEEMED AS FAR AWAY AND AS UNSUBSTANTIAL AS A DREAM NOR HAS ITS POWER OVER ME GONE YET I GO ABOUT AMONGST YOU I EAT I SLEEP OR TRY TO I GREET MEN TALK WITH WOMEN
7967-104986-0007 BUT IT IS ALL UNREAL ALL PHANTASMAGORIC EVEN YOURSELF AND YOUR LOVE AND O GOD MY BABY WHAT IS REAL AND DISTINCTIVE AN ABSOLUTE PART OF ME AND MY LIFE IS THAT SHAPE FROM THE DEAD WITH ITS THREATENING EYES WHICH PIERCE
7967-104986-0008 PIERCE SHE WAS LOSING HER SELF CONTROL HER HUSBAND WITH A SOOTHING TOUCH ON HER ARM BROUGHT HER BACK TO THE PRESENT YOU SPEAK OF A FORM HE SAID A SHADOWY OUTLINE THE FORM OF WHAT A MAN OR A WOMAN
7967-104986-0009 A MAN A MAN WITH THE EXCLAMATION SHE SEEMED TO SHRINK INTO HERSELF AND HER EYES JUST NOW DEPRECATING AND APPEALING TOOK ON A HOLLOW STARE AS IF THE VISION SHE DESCRIBED HAD RISEN AGAIN BEFORE HER IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
7967-104986-0010 AND THE SYMPATHY HE UNDOUBTEDLY FELT FOR HER AN EJACULATION OF IMPATIENCE LEFT HER HUSBAND'S LIPS OBLIGATIONS VERY FAR REMOVED FROM THE FANTASIES OF A DISTURBED MIND
7967-104986-0011 NO DOUBT SHE HEARD IT AND TO STOP THE MATTER OF FACT PROTEST ON HIS LIPS ADDED QUICKLY NOT THE FORM FACE AND EYES OF A MAN AS THEY USUALLY APPEAR HELL WAS IN HIS GAZE AND THE MESSAGE HE GAVE IF IT WAS A MESSAGE
7967-104986-0012 WAS ONE OF DISASTER IF NOT DEATH DO YOU WONDER THAT MY HAPPINESS VANISHED BEFORE IT THAT I CAN NOT BE MYSELF SINCE THAT DREADFUL DAY THE MAYOR WAS A PRACTICAL MAN HE KEPT CLOSE TO THE SUBJECT
7967-104986-0013 YOU SAW THIS FORM BETWEEN YOU AND THE LIGHTED LAMP HOW LONG DID IT STAY THERE AND WHAT BECAME OF IT I CAN NOT TELL YOU ONE MOMENT IT WAS THERE AND THE NEXT IT WAS GONE AND I FOUND MYSELF STARING INTO VACANCY
7967-104986-0014 I SEEM TO BE STARING THERE STILL WAITING FOR THE BLOW DESTINED TO SHATTER THIS HOUSEHOLD NONSENSE GIVE ME A KISS AND FIX YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL WHAT WE HAVE TO FEAR AND ALL WE HAVE TO FEAR IS THAT I MAY LOSE MY ELECTION
7967-104986-0015 AND THAT WON'T KILL ME WHATEVER EFFECT IT MAY HAVE ON THE PARTY HENRY HER VOICE HAD CHANGED TO ONE MORE NATURAL ALSO HER MANNER THE CONFIDENCE EXPRESSED IN THIS OUTBURST THE VITALITY
7967-104986-0016 THE MASCULINE ATTITUDE HE TOOK WERE PRODUCING THEIR EFFECT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAW OR IN MY FEARS PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT I AM READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS I WILL TRY TO LOOK UPON IT ALL AS A FREAK OF MY IMAGINATION
7967-104986-0017 IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO FORGET THESE DREADFUL DAYS AND IF PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE WILL LEAVE ME ALONE AND NOT PRINT SUCH THINGS ABOUT ME I AM READY TO DO MY PART WAS HIS GLAD REPLY AND AS FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE YOU MENTION
7967-104986-0018 WE SHALL SOON BRING THEM TO BOOK RAISING HIS VOICE HE CALLED OUT HIS SECRETARY'S NAME AS IT RANG LOUD AND CHEERY DOWN THE HALL THE JOY AND RENEWED LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN VISIBLE IN HER MANNER LOST SOME OF THEIR BRIGHTNESS
7967-104986-0019 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO SHE GASPED WITH THE QUICKNESS OF DOUBT AND STRONG IF REASONLESS APPREHENSION GIVE AN ORDER HE EXPLAINED THEN AS THE SECRETARY APPEARED AT OUR END OF THE HALL HE HELD OUT THE JOURNAL WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM HIS WIFE
7967-104986-0020 AND INDICATING THE OFFENSIVE PARAGRAPH SAID FIND OUT WHO DID THAT MISTER STEELE WITH A SURPRISED LOOK RAN HIS EYES OVER THE PARAGRAPH KNITTING HIS BROWS AS HE DID
7967-104986-0021 IT IS CALUMNY FELL FROM MISSUS PACKARD'S LIPS AS SHE WATCHED HIM MOST CERTAINLY HE ASSENTED WITH AN ENERGY WHICH BROUGHT A FLUSH OF PLEASURE TO THE HUMILIATED WOMAN'S CHEEK IT WILL DETAIN ME TWO DAYS OR MORE TO FOLLOW UP THIS MATTER HE REMARKED
7967-104986-0022 WITH A LOOK OF INQUIRY DIRECTED AT MAYOR PACKARD NEVER MIND TWO DAYS OR A WEEK IT IS ALL ONE I WOULD RATHER LOSE VOTES THAN PASS OVER SUCH AN INSULT PIN ME DOWN THE MAN WHO HAS DARED ATTACK ME THROUGH MY WIFE
7967-104986-0023 AND YOU WILL DO ME THE GREATEST FAVOR ONE MAN CAN SHOW ANOTHER MISTER STEELE BOWED I CAN NOT FOREGO THE FINAL CONSULTATION WE HAD PLANNED TO HOLD ON THE TRAIN MAY I RIDE DOWN WITH YOU TO THE STATION CERTAINLY MOST HAPPY
7967-104986-0024 MISTER STEELE WITHDREW AFTER CASTING A GLANCE OF ENTIRELY RESPECTFUL SYMPATHY AT THE WOMAN WHO UP TO THIS HOUR HAD FACED THE WORLD WITHOUT A SHADOW BETWEEN HER AND IT AND MARKING THE LINGERING NATURE OF THE LOOK WITH WHICH THE MAYOR NOW TURNED ON HIS WIFE
7967-104986-0025 I FOLLOWED THE SECRETARY'S EXAMPLE AND LEFT THEM TO ENJOY THEIR FEW LAST WORDS ALONE VERILY THE PENDULUM OF EVENTS SWUNG WIDE AND FAST IN THIS HOUSE THIS CONCLUSION WAS BROUGHT BACK TO ME WITH FRESH INSISTENCE A FEW MINUTES LATER WHEN
7967-104986-0026 ON HEARING THE FRONT DOOR SHUT I STEPPED TO THE BALUSTRADE AND LOOKED OVER TO SEE IF MISSUS PACKARD WAS COMING UP SHE WAS NOT FOR I SAW HER GO INTO THE LIBRARY BUT PLAINLY ON THE MARBLE PAVEMENT BELOW
7967-104986-0027 I PERCEIVED THE PIECE OF PAPER SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER FROM THE DINING ROOM AND HAD DOUBTLESS DROPPED IN THE COURSE OF THE FOREGOING CONVERSATION RUNNING DOWN IN GREAT HASTE I PICKED IT UP THIS SCRAP OF I KNEW NOT WHAT
7967-104986-0028 BUT WHICH HAD BEEN THE OCCASION OF THE ENIGMATIC SCENE I HAD WITNESSED AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE NECESSARILY INTERESTED ME VERY MUCH AND I COULD NOT HELP GIVING IT A LOOK
7967-104986-0029 AS UNLIKE AS POSSIBLE TO THE SCRAWL OF A LITTLE CHILD WITH NO MEANS OF KNOWING WHETHER THEY WERE LEGIBLE OR NOT THESE CHARACTERS MADE A SURPRISING IMPRESSION UPON ME ONE INDEED THAT WAS ALMOST PHOTOGRAPHIC
7967-104986-0030 I ALSO NOTED THAT THESE SHAPES OR CHARACTERS OF WHICH THERE WERE JUST SEVEN WERE WRITTEN ON THE FACE OF AN EMPTY ENVELOPE THIS DECIDED ANY DOUBTS I MAY HAVE HAD AS TO ITS IDENTITY WITH THE PAPER SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE ATTIC
7967-104986-0031 THAT HAD BEEN A SQUARE SHEET WHICH EVEN IF FOLDED WOULD FAIL TO ENTER THIS LONG AND NARROW ENVELOPE THE INTEREST WHICH I HAD FELT WHEN I THOUGHT THE TWO IDENTICAL WAS A FALSE INTEREST YET I COULD NOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THIS SCRAP HAD A VALUE OF ITS OWN
7967-104986-0032 EQUAL TO THE ONE WITH WHICH UNDER THIS MISAPPREHENSION I HAD INVESTED IT CARRYING IT BACK TO MISSUS PACKARD I HANDED IT OVER WITH THE REMARK THAT I HAD FOUND IT LYING IN THE HALL SHE CAST A QUICK LOOK AT IT
7967-104986-0033 GAVE ME ANOTHER LOOK AND TOSSED THE PAPER INTO THE GRATE AS IT CAUGHT FIRE AND FLARED UP THE CHARACTERS STARTED VIVIDLY INTO VIEW THIS SECOND GLIMPSE OF THEM ADDED TO THE ONE ALREADY GIVEN ME FIXED THE WHOLE INDELIBLY IN MY MIND
7967-104986-0034 LEAP UP THE CHIMNEY MISSUS PACKARD REMARKED I WISH I COULD DESTROY THE MEMORY OF ALL MY MISTAKES AS COMPLETELY AS I CAN THAT OLD ENVELOPE I DID NOT ANSWER I WAS WATCHING THE WEARY DROOP OF HER HAND OVER THE ARM OF HER CHAIR
7967-104986-0035 YOU ARE TIRED MISSUS PACKARD WAS MY SYMPATHETIC OBSERVATION WILL YOU NOT TAKE A NAP I WILL GLADLY SIT BY YOU AND READ YOU TO SLEEP
7967-104986-0036 LOOK AT THAT PILE OF CORRESPONDENCE HALF OF IT ON CHARITABLE MATTERS NOW THAT I FEEL BETTER NOW THAT I HAVE RELIEVED MY MIND I MUST LOOK OVER MY LETTERS AND TRY TO TAKE UP THE OLD THREADS AGAIN CAN I HELP YOU I ASKED POSSIBLY
7967-104986-0037 IF YOU WILL GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS I WILL JOIN YOU AFTER I HAVE SORTED AND READ MY MAIL I WAS GLAD TO OBEY THIS ORDER I HAD A CURIOSITY ABOUT HER ROOM IT HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF MUCH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE NIGHT BEFORE
7967-104986-0038 SHOULD I FIND ANY TRACES THERE OF THAT SEARCH WHICH HAD FINALLY ENDED OVER MY HEAD IN THE ATTIC I WAS MET AT THE DOOR BY ELLEN SHE WORE A LOOK OF DISMAY WHICH I FELT FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR WHEN I LOOKED INSIDE
7967-104986-0039 DISORDER REIGNED FROM ONE END OF THE ROOM TO THE OTHER TRANSCENDING ANY PICTURE I MAY HAVE FORMED IN MY OWN MIND CONCERNING ITS PROBABLE CONDITION MISSUS PACKARD MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL THIS DISARRAY OR AT LEAST HAD SUPPOSED IT TO HAVE YIELDED TO THE EFFORTS OF THE MAID
7967-104986-0040 WHEN SHE PROPOSED MY AWAITING HER THERE THERE WERE BUREAU DRAWERS WITH THEIR CONTENTS HALF ON THE FLOOR BOXES WITH THEIR COVERS OFF CUPBOARD DOORS AJAR AND EVEN THE CLOSET SHELVES SHOWING EVERY MARK OF A FRENZIED SEARCH AMONG THEM
7967-104986-0041 HER RICH GOWN SOILED TO THE WIDTH OF HALF A FOOT AROUND THE BOTTOM LAY WITH CUT LACES AND ITS TRIMMINGS IN RAGS UNDER A CHAIR WHICH HAD BEEN KNOCKED OVER AND LEFT WHERE IT FELL EVEN HER JEWELS HAD NOT BEEN PUT AWAY BUT LAY SCATTERED ON THE DRESSER
7967-104986-0042 ELLEN LOOKED ASHAMED AND WHEN I RETIRED TO THE ONE BARE PLACE I SAW IN THE BAY OF THE WINDOW MUTTERED AS SHE PLUNGED TO LIFT ONE OF THE GREAT BOXES IT'S AS BAD AS THE ATTIC ROOM UP STAIRS ALL THE TRUNKS HAVE BEEN EMPTIED ON TO THE FLOOR AND
7967-104986-0043 ONE HELD HER BEST SUMMER DRESSES WHAT SHALL I DO I HAVE A WHOLE MORNING'S WORK BEFORE ME LET ME HELP YOU I PROPOSED RISING WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY MY EYES HAD JUST FALLEN ON A SMALL DESK AT MY RIGHT ALSO ON THE FLOOR BENEATH AND AROUND IT
7967-104986-0044 HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE ABOVE AND BELOW LAY SCRAPS OF TORN UP PAPER AND ON MANY IF NOT ON ALL OF THEM COULD BE SEEN THE BROKEN SQUARES AND INVERTED ANGLES WHICH HAD MARKED SO CURIOUSLY THE SURFACE OF THE ENVELOPE SHE HAD HANDED TO MISTER STEELE
7967-104986-0045 AND WHICH I HAD AFTERWARD SEEN HER BURN A BABY CAN MAKE A DEAL OF MESS I REMARKED HURRIEDLY COLLECTING THESE SCRAPS AND MAKING A MOTION OF THROWING THEM INTO THE WASTE PAPER BASKET BUT HIDING THEM IN MY BLOUSE INSTEAD
7967-104986-0046 THE BABY OH THE BABY NEVER DID THAT SHE'S TOO YOUNG OH I DIDN'T KNOW I HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF THE CHILD THOUGH I HEARD HER CRY ONCE IN THE NURSERY HOW OLD IS SHE TWENTY MONTHS AND SUCH A DARLING YOU NEVER SAW SUCH CURLS OR SUCH EYES
7967-104986-0047 WHY LOOK AT THIS WHAT I DEMANDED HURRYING TO THE CLOSET WHERE ELLEN STOOD BENDING OVER SOMETHING INVISIBLE TO ME OH NOTHING SHE ANSWERED COMING QUICKLY OUT BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT HER TONGUE GETTING THE BETTER OF HER DISCRETION SHE BLURTED OUT
7967-104986-0048 DO YOU SUPPOSE MISSUS PACKARD HAD ANY IDEA OF GOING WITH THE MAYOR HER BAG IS IN THERE ALMOST PACKED I WAS WONDERING WHERE ALL HER TOILET ARTICLES WERE THAT ACCOUNTS STOPPING SHE CAST A GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM ENDING WITH A SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND A SHRUG
