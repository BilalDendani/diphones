4463-707-0000 IT WAS VERY LATE ACCORDING TO THE MONASTERY IDEAS WHEN ALYOSHA RETURNED TO THE HERMITAGE THE DOOR KEEPER LET HIM IN BY A SPECIAL ENTRANCE IT HAD STRUCK NINE O'CLOCK THE HOUR OF REST AND REPOSE AFTER A DAY OF SUCH AGITATION FOR ALL
4463-707-0001 ALYOSHA TIMIDLY OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT INTO THE ELDER'S CELL WHERE HIS COFFIN WAS NOW STANDING THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE CELL BUT FATHER PAISSY READING THE GOSPEL IN SOLITUDE OVER THE COFFIN
4463-707-0002 AND THE YOUNG NOVICE PORFIRY WHO EXHAUSTED BY THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S CONVERSATION AND THE DISTURBING INCIDENTS OF THE DAY WAS SLEEPING THE DEEP SOUND SLEEP OF YOUTH ON THE FLOOR OF THE OTHER ROOM THOUGH FATHER PAISSY HEARD ALYOSHA COME IN
4463-707-0003 HE DID NOT EVEN LOOK IN HIS DIRECTION ALYOSHA TURNED TO THE RIGHT FROM THE DOOR TO THE CORNER FELL ON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO PRAY HIS SOUL WAS OVERFLOWING BUT WITH MINGLED FEELINGS NO SINGLE SENSATION STOOD OUT DISTINCTLY
4463-707-0004 ON THE CONTRARY ONE DROVE OUT ANOTHER IN A SLOW CONTINUAL ROTATION BUT THERE WAS A SWEETNESS IN HIS HEART AND STRANGE TO SAY ALYOSHA WAS NOT SURPRISED AT IT
4463-707-0005 AGAIN HE SAW THAT COFFIN BEFORE HIM THE HIDDEN DEAD FIGURE SO PRECIOUS TO HIM BUT THE WEEPING AND POIGNANT GRIEF OF THE MORNING WAS NO LONGER ACHING IN HIS SOUL AS SOON AS HE CAME IN HE FELL DOWN BEFORE THE COFFIN AS BEFORE A HOLY SHRINE
4463-707-0006 BUT JOY JOY WAS GLOWING IN HIS MIND AND IN HIS HEART THE ONE WINDOW OF THE CELL WAS OPEN THE AIR WAS FRESH AND COOL SO THE SMELL MUST HAVE BECOME STRONGER IF THEY OPENED THE WINDOW THOUGHT ALYOSHA
4463-707-0007 BUT EVEN THIS THOUGHT OF THE SMELL OF CORRUPTION WHICH HAD SEEMED TO HIM SO AWFUL AND HUMILIATING A FEW HOURS BEFORE NO LONGER MADE HIM FEEL MISERABLE OR INDIGNANT HE BEGAN QUIETLY PRAYING BUT HE SOON FELT THAT HE WAS PRAYING ALMOST MECHANICALLY
4463-707-0008 FRAGMENTS OF THOUGHT FLOATED THROUGH HIS SOUL FLASHED LIKE STARS AND WENT OUT AGAIN AT ONCE TO BE SUCCEEDED BY OTHERS BUT YET THERE WAS REIGNING IN HIS SOUL A SENSE OF THE WHOLENESS OF THINGS SOMETHING STEADFAST AND COMFORTING AND HE WAS AWARE OF IT HIMSELF
4463-707-0009 SOMETIMES HE BEGAN PRAYING ARDENTLY HE LONGED TO POUR OUT HIS THANKFULNESS AND LOVE BUT WHEN HE HAD BEGUN TO PRAY HE PASSED SUDDENLY TO SOMETHING ELSE AND SANK INTO THOUGHT FORGETTING BOTH THE PRAYER
4463-707-0010 AND WHAT HAD INTERRUPTED IT HE BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT FATHER PAISSY WAS READING BUT WORN OUT WITH EXHAUSTION HE GRADUALLY BEGAN TO DOZE AND THE THIRD DAY THERE WAS A MARRIAGE IN CANA OF GALILEE READ FATHER PAISSY AND THE MOTHER OF JESUS WAS THERE
4463-707-0011 MARRIAGE WHAT'S THAT A MARRIAGE FLOATED WHIRLING THROUGH ALYOSHA'S MIND THERE IS HAPPINESS FOR HER TOO
4463-707-0012 WELL TRAGIC PHRASES SHOULD BE FORGIVEN THEY MUST BE TRAGIC PHRASES COMFORT THE HEART WITHOUT THEM SORROW WOULD BE TOO HEAVY FOR MEN TO BEAR
4463-707-0013 RAKITIN HAS GONE OFF TO THE BACK ALLEY AS LONG AS RAKITIN BROODS OVER HIS WRONGS HE WILL ALWAYS GO OFF TO THE BACK ALLEY BUT THE HIGH ROAD THE ROAD IS WIDE AND STRAIGHT AND BRIGHT AS CRYSTAL
4463-707-0014 BEING READ AND WHEN THEY WANTED WINE THE MOTHER OF JESUS SAITH UNTO HIM THEY HAVE NO WINE ALYOSHA HEARD
4463-707-0015 THAT MIRACLE AH THAT SWEET MIRACLE IT WAS NOT MEN'S GRIEF BUT THEIR JOY CHRIST VISITED HE WORKED HIS FIRST MIRACLE TO HELP MEN'S GLADNESS
4463-707-0016 HE WHO LOVES MEN LOVES THEIR GLADNESS TOO HE WAS ALWAYS REPEATING THAT IT WAS ONE OF HIS LEADING IDEAS THERE'S NO LIVING WITHOUT JOY MITYA SAYS
4463-707-0017 WHAT HAS IT TO DO WITH THEE OR ME
4463-707-0018 HIS MOTHER SAITH UNTO THE SERVANTS WHATSOEVER HE SAITH UNTO YOU
4463-707-0019 THE HISTORIANS WRITE THAT IN THOSE DAYS THE PEOPLE LIVING ABOUT THE LAKE OF GENNESARET WERE THE POOREST THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE IMAGINED AND ANOTHER GREAT HEART THAT OTHER GREAT BEING HIS MOTHER KNEW THAT HE HAD COME NOT ONLY TO MAKE HIS GREAT TERRIBLE SACRIFICE
4463-707-0020 SHE KNEW THAT HIS HEART WAS OPEN EVEN TO THE SIMPLE ARTLESS MERRYMAKING OF SOME OBSCURE AND UNLEARNED PEOPLE WHO HAD WARMLY BIDDEN HIM TO THEIR POOR WEDDING
4463-707-0021 AND INDEED WAS IT TO MAKE WINE ABUNDANT AT POOR WEDDINGS HE HAD COME DOWN TO EARTH AND YET HE WENT AND DID AS SHE ASKED HIM
4463-707-0022 JESUS SAITH UNTO THEM FILL THE WATERPOTS WITH WATER AND THEY FILLED THEM UP TO THE BRIM AND HE SAITH UNTO THEM DRAW OUT NOW AND BEAR UNTO THE GOVERNOR OF THE FEAST AND THEY BARE IT WHEN THE RULER OF THE FEAST HAD TASTED THE WATER THAT WAS MADE WINE
4463-707-0023 AND KNEW NOT WHENCE IT WAS BUT THE SERVANTS WHICH DREW THE WATER KNEW THE GOVERNOR OF THE FEAST CALLED THE BRIDEGROOM AND SAITH UNTO HIM EVERY MAN AT THE BEGINNING DOTH SET FORTH GOOD WINE AND WHEN MEN HAVE WELL DRUNK THAT WHICH IS WORSE
4463-707-0024 BUT THOU HAST KEPT THE GOOD WINE UNTIL NOW BUT WHAT'S THIS WHAT'S THIS WHY IS THE ROOM GROWING WIDER AH YES IT'S THE MARRIAGE THE WEDDING YES OF COURSE
4463-707-0025 WHEN THE VISITORS HAD GATHERED ABOUT HIM HIS FACE WAS UNCOVERED HIS EYES WERE SHINING HOW WAS THIS THEN HE TOO HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE FEAST HE TOO AT THE MARRIAGE OF CANA IN GALILEE YES MY DEAR I AM CALLED TOO CALLED AND BIDDEN
4463-707-0026 HE HEARD A SOFT VOICE SAYING OVER HIM WHY HAVE YOU HIDDEN YOURSELF HERE OUT OF SIGHT YOU COME AND JOIN US TOO IT WAS HIS VOICE THE VOICE OF FATHER ZOSSIMA AND IT MUST BE HE SINCE HE CALLED HIM
4463-707-0027 THE ELDER RAISED ALYOSHA BY THE HAND AND HE ROSE FROM HIS KNEES WE ARE REJOICING THE LITTLE THIN OLD MAN WENT ON WE ARE DRINKING THE NEW WINE THE WINE OF NEW GREAT GLADNESS DO YOU SEE HOW MANY GUESTS HERE ARE THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM

4463-707-0029 DO YOU SEE HIM I AM AFRAID I DARE NOT LOOK WHISPERED ALYOSHA DO NOT FEAR HIM HE IS TERRIBLE IN HIS GREATNESS AWFUL IN HIS SUBLIMITY BUT INFINITELY MERCIFUL
4463-707-0030 HE HAS MADE HIMSELF LIKE UNTO US FROM LOVE AND REJOICES WITH US HE IS CHANGING THE WATER INTO WINE THAT THE GLADNESS OF THE GUESTS MAY NOT BE CUT SHORT HE IS EXPECTING NEW GUESTS HE IS CALLING NEW ONES UNCEASINGLY FOR EVER AND EVER
4463-707-0031 THERE THEY ARE BRINGING NEW WINE DO YOU SEE THEY ARE BRINGING THE VESSELS SOMETHING GLOWED IN ALYOSHA'S HEART SOMETHING FILLED IT TILL IT ACHED TEARS OF RAPTURE ROSE FROM HIS SOUL HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS UTTERED A CRY AND WAKED UP AGAIN THE COFFIN
4463-707-0032 THE OPEN WINDOW AND THE SOFT SOLEMN DISTINCT READING OF THE GOSPEL BUT ALYOSHA DID NOT LISTEN TO THE READING
4463-707-0033 BUT NOW HE WAS ON HIS FEET AND SUDDENLY AS THOUGH THROWN FORWARD
4463-707-0034 HIS SHOULDER BRUSHED AGAINST FATHER PAISSY WITHOUT HIS NOTICING IT FATHER PAISSY RAISED HIS EYES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS BOOK BUT LOOKED AWAY AGAIN AT ONCE SEEING THAT SOMETHING STRANGE WAS HAPPENING TO THE BOY ALYOSHA GAZED FOR HALF A MINUTE AT THE COFFIN AT THE COVERED MOTIONLESS DEAD MAN THAT LAY IN THE COFFIN
4463-707-0035 HE HAD ONLY JUST BEEN HEARING HIS VOICE
4463-707-0036 STILL EXPECTING OTHER WORDS BUT SUDDENLY HE TURNED SHARPLY AND WENT OUT OF THE CELL HE DID NOT STOP ON THE STEPS EITHER BUT WENT QUICKLY DOWN HIS SOUL OVERFLOWING WITH RAPTURE YEARNED FOR FREEDOM SPACE OPENNESS
4463-707-0037 THE VAULT OF HEAVEN FULL OF SOFT SHINING STARS STRETCHED VAST AND FATHOMLESS ABOVE HIM THE MILKY WAY RAN IN TWO PALE STREAMS FROM THE ZENITH TO THE HORIZON THE FRESH MOTIONLESS STILL NIGHT ENFOLDED THE EARTH THE WHITE TOWERS AND GOLDEN DOMES OF THE CATHEDRAL
4463-707-0038 GLEAMED OUT AGAINST THE SAPPHIRE SKY THE GORGEOUS AUTUMN FLOWERS IN THE BEDS ROUND THE HOUSE WERE SLUMBERING TILL MORNING THE SILENCE OF EARTH SEEMED TO MELT INTO THE SILENCE OF THE HEAVENS THE MYSTERY OF EARTH WAS ONE WITH THE MYSTERY OF THE STARS
4463-707-0039 ALYOSHA STOOD GAZED AND SUDDENLY THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON THE EARTH HE DID NOT KNOW WHY HE EMBRACED IT HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY HE LONGED SO IRRESISTIBLY TO KISS IT TO KISS IT ALL BUT HE KISSED IT WEEPING SOBBING AND WATERING IT WITH HIS TEARS
4463-707-0040 AND VOWED PASSIONATELY TO LOVE IT TO LOVE IT FOR EVER AND EVER WATER THE EARTH WITH THE TEARS OF YOUR JOY AND LOVE THOSE TEARS ECHOED IN HIS SOUL WHAT WAS HE WEEPING OVER OH
4463-707-0041 IN HIS RAPTURE HE WAS WEEPING EVEN OVER THOSE STARS WHICH WERE SHINING TO HIM FROM THE ABYSS OF SPACE AND HE WAS NOT ASHAMED OF THAT ECSTASY THERE SEEMED TO BE THREADS FROM ALL THOSE INNUMERABLE WORLDS OF GOD LINKING HIS SOUL TO THEM AND
4463-707-0042 IT WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER IN CONTACT WITH OTHER WORLDS HE LONGED TO FORGIVE EVERY ONE AND FOR EVERYTHING AND TO BEG FORGIVENESS OH NOT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR ALL MEN FOR ALL AND FOR EVERYTHING AND OTHERS ARE PRAYING FOR ME TOO
4463-707-0043 ECHOED AGAIN IN HIS SOUL BUT WITH EVERY INSTANT HE FELT CLEARLY AND AS IT WERE TANGIBLY THAT SOMETHING FIRM AND UNSHAKABLE AS THAT VAULT OF HEAVEN HAD ENTERED INTO HIS SOUL IT WAS AS THOUGH SOME IDEA HAD SEIZED THE SOVEREIGNTY OF HIS MIND
4463-707-0044 AND IT WAS FOR ALL HIS LIFE AND FOR EVER AND EVER HE HAD FALLEN ON THE EARTH A WEAK BOY BUT HE ROSE UP A RESOLUTE CHAMPION AND HE KNEW AND FELT IT SUDDENLY AT THE VERY MOMENT OF HIS ECSTASY
