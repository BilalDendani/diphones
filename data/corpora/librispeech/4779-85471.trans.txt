4779-85471-0000 MOST THANKFUL WAS HE FOR THE RELIEF WHICH FOLLOWED THE DEPARTURE OF THE LAST OF THOSE WHO CAME TO DO HONOUR TO THESE SPLENDID OBSEQUIES AND MOST SOOTHING WAS IT TO HIS WOUNDED AND WEARY SPIRITS TO FIND HIMSELF ONCE MORE SURROUNDED ONLY BY THOSE WHO COULD READ IN A LOOK ALL HE WISHED TO EXPRESS
4779-85471-0001 AND WHO REQUIRED NO WELCOME TO SHARE IN THE SORROW OF THAT BITTER DAY BUT LIKE ALL OTHER PERIODS OF HUMAN LIFE WHETHER MARKED BY SORROW OR BY JOY IT PASSED AWAY WITH AS EVEN AND JUSTLY MEASURED A PACE AS IF NO EVENT DISTINGUISHED IT FROM ITS FELLOW DAYS
4779-85471-0002 AND THEN BY SLOW BUT SURE DEGREES THE LITTLE TRIFLING ORDINARY ROUTINE OF DAILY CIRCUMSTANCE CAME WITH ITS INVISIBLE AND UNNOTICED MAGIC TO EFFACE OR AT LEAST TO WEAKEN FEELINGS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE STAMP OF BURNING IRON ON THEIR SOULS
4779-85471-0003 CHARLES MOWBRAY HAD NOT YET TAKEN HIS DEGREE AND WISHING TO DO SO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE WAS ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO CHRIST CHURCH WITHOUT DELAY BUT HIS FATHER'S WILL HAD NOT YET BEEN OPENED AND AT THE REQUEST OF HIS MOTHER HE POSTPONED HIS DEPARTURE TILL THIS COULD BE DONE
4779-85471-0004 THIS IMPORTANT DOCUMENT WAS IN THE HANDS OF SIR GILBERT HARRINGTON AN INTIMATE FRIEND AND NEIGHBOUR
4779-85471-0005 WHO BEING IN LONDON AT THE TIME OF MISTER MOWBRAY'S DEATH HAD BEEN UNABLE TO OBEY THE SUMMONS SENT TO HIM IN TIME TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL BUT WITHIN A WEEK AFTER HE ARRIVED AND THE FOLLOWING MORNING WAS FIXED UPON FOR THIS NECESSARY BUSINESS THE PERSONS PRESENT WERE SIR GILBERT HARRINGTON MISTER CARTWRIGHT
4779-85471-0006 A RESPECTABLE SOLICITOR FROM THE COUNTRY TOWN WHO HAD HIMSELF DRAWN THE INSTRUMENT AND CHARLES MOWBRAY IT WAS DATED RATHER MORE THAN TEN YEARS BACK AND AFTER THE USUAL PREAMBLE RAN THUS
4779-85471-0007 IN ORDER THAT MY CHILDREN OR ANY OTHER PERSONS WHOM IT MAY CONCERN MAY KNOW THE REASON AND MOTIVE OF THE DISPOSITION OF MY PROPERTY WHICH I AM ABOUT TO MAKE IT IS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD THEREWITH STATE THE MANNER OF MY MARRIAGE WITH CLARA HELENA FRANCES
4779-85471-0008 MY DEARLY BELOVED WIFE NOTWITHSTANDING HER VAST POSSESSIONS I WOOED AND MARRIED HER SOLELY BECAUSE I LOVED HER AND THIS SHE HAD THE GENEROSITY TO BELIEVE
4779-85471-0009 THOUGH I WAS NEARLY PENNILESS HAVING NOTHING BUT MY TRUE AFFECTION AND GOOD BLOOD TO OFFER IN RETURN FOR ALL THE WEALTH SHE BROUGHT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS SHE WITHSTOOD MY EARNEST SOLICITATIONS FOR AN IMMEDIATE UNION BECAUSE
4779-85471-0010 NOR WOULD SHE SUBSEQUENTLY SIGN ANY DOCUMENT WHATEVER PREVIOUS TO HER MARRIAGE THEREBY RENDERING ME THE SOLE POSSESSOR OF HER FORTUNE WHEREFORE TO SHOW MY SENSE OF THIS UNPARALLELED CONFIDENCE AND GENEROSITY I HEREBY MAKE HER THE SOLE INHERITRIX OF ALL I POSSESS
4779-85471-0011 AND THEN FOLLOWED WITH EVERY NECESSARY AND UNNECESSARY TECHNICALITY OF THE LAW SUCH A DISPOSITION OF HIS PROPERTY AS LEFT HIS CHILDREN ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THEIR MOTHER BOTH FOR THEIR PRESENT AND FUTURE SUBSISTENCE THAT THIS WILL WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING THAT CHARLES MOWBRAY EXPECTED
4779-85471-0012 IS MOST CERTAIN AND THERE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN SOME SLIGHT FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT AT FINDING HIMSELF DEPENDENT EVEN UPON HIS MOTHER BUT IF SUCH THERE WERE IT WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO PREVENT HIS DOING JUSTICE TO THE NOBLE FEELING WHICH HAD LED TO IT AND IN TRUTH
4779-85471-0013 HE FELT SO CERTAIN OF THE FOND AFFECTION OF HIS MOTHER THAT NOT A SHADOW OF FEAR EITHER FOR HIS OWN INTEREST OR THAT OF HIS SISTERS CROSSED HIS MIND THE LAWYER WHO READ ALOUD THE DEED HE HAD PENNED HAD OF COURSE NO OBSERVATION TO MAKE UPON IT
4779-85471-0014 AND MISTER CARTWRIGHT ONLY REMARKED THAT IT WAS A PROOF OF VERY DEVOTED LOVE AND CONFIDENCE OF THE SMALL PARTY PRESENT AT THIS LECTURE SIR GILBERT HARRINGTON WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO TESTIFIED ANY STRONG EMOTION RESPECTING IT
4779-85471-0015 AND HIS DISPLEASURE AND VEXATION WERE EXPRESSED IN NO VERY MEASURED TERMS HIS WARMTH WAS AT LENGTH CHECKED NOT BECAUSE HE HAD UTTERED ALL HE HAD TO SAY BUT BECAUSE HE MET THE EYE OF MISTER CARTWRIGHT FIXED UPON HIM WITH A SORT OF SCRUTINY THAT WAS UNPLEASING TO HIS FEELINGS
4779-85471-0016 HE THEREFORE STOPPED SHORT IN THE PHILIPPIC HE WAS POURING FORTH UPON THE INFERNAL FOLLY OF A MAN'S ACTING IN MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS FRIENDS AND TAKING THE ARM OF CHARLES WALKED THROUGH THE HALL INTO THE GROUNDS WITHOUT APPEARING TO REMEMBER THAT AS HE WAS LEFT JOINT EXECUTOR WITH MISSUS MOWBRAY TO THE WILL
4779-85471-0017 IT MIGHT BE EXPECTED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE SOME NOTIFICATION OF ITS CONTENTS TO HER BEFORE HE LEFT THE HOUSE SHALL WE NOT SPEAK TO MY MOTHER SIR GILBERT SAID MOWBRAY ENDEAVOURING TO RESTRAIN THE EAGER STEP OF THE BARONET AS HE WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HALL DOOR NO SIR WAS THE LACONIC REPLY
4779-85471-0018 AND ON HE STALKED WITH A MORE RAPID STEP THAN BEFORE THE CONVERSATION WHICH PASSED BETWEEN THEM DURING THE HOUR WHICH INTERVENED BEFORE SIR GILBERT CLAMBERED UP TO HIS SADDLE AND GALLOPED OFF
4779-85471-0019 WAS MADE UP OF SOMETHING BETWEEN LAMENTATION AND ANATHEMA ON HIS SIDE AND THE MOST EARNEST ASSURANCES THAT NO MISCHIEF COULD ENSUE FROM HIS FATHER'S WILL ON THE PART OF CHARLES THE TESTY OLD GENTLEMAN COULD NOT HOWEVER BE WROUGHT UPON TO SEE THE WIDOW WHO AS HE SAID
4779-85471-0020 MUST HAVE USED MOST CURSED CUNNING IN OBTAINING SUCH A WILL OF WHICH HOWEVER POOR LADY SHE WAS AS INNOCENT AS THE BABE UNBORN AND HE AT LENGTH LEFT THE PARK POSITIVE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A FIT OF THE GOUT AND THAT THE WIDOW MOWBRAY WOULD MARRY WITHIN A YEAR
4779-85471-0021 AS SOON AS HE HAD GOT RID OF HIS WARM HEARTED BUT PASSIONATE OLD FRIEND MOWBRAY HASTENED TO REPAIR THE NEGLECT HE HAD BEEN FORCED INTO COMMITTING AND SOUGHT HIS MOTHER IN THE DRAWING ROOM BUT SHE WAS NO LONGER THERE THE ROOM INDEED APPEARED TO BE WHOLLY UNTENANTED
4779-85471-0022 AND HE WAS ON THE POINT OF LEAVING IT TO SEEK HIS MOTHER ELSEWHERE WHEN HE PERCEIVED THAT MISS TORRINGTON WAS SEATED AT THE MOST DISTANT CORNER OF IT ALMOST CONCEALED BY THE FOLDS OF THE FARTHEST WINDOW CURTAIN
4779-85471-0023 I AM LEFT ALONE MISTER MOWBRAY BECAUSE I WISHED IT HELEN AND FANNY ARE WITH YOUR MOTHER I BELIEVE IN HER ROOM CHARLES WISHED TO SEE THEM ALL AND TO SEE THEM TOGETHER AND HAD ALMOST TURNED TO GO BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE LOOK AND MANNER OF ROSALIND THAT PUZZLED HIM AND GOING UP TO HER HE SAID KINDLY
4779-85471-0024 IS ANYTHING THE MATTER ROSALIND YOU LOOK AS IF SOMETHING HAD VEXED YOU TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND TURNING FROM HIM AS IF TO HIDE AN EMOTION SHE COULD NOT CONQUER SHE SAID
4779-85471-0025 WHO THEN HAS TOLD HER OF IT ROSALIND WAS IT THE LAWYER WAS IT MISTER HUMPHRIES NO SIR IT WAS MISTER CARTWRIGHT BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BE DISPLEASED WITH ME FOR THIS DEAR ROSALIND SIR GILBERT LED ME OUT OF THE LIBRARY BY FORCE AND WOULD NOT LET ME GO TO MY MOTHER AS I WISHED TO DO
4779-85471-0026 AND I HAVE BUT THIS INSTANT GOT RID OF HIM BUT I DID NOT COMMISSION EITHER MISTER CARTWRIGHT OR ANY ONE ELSE TO MAKE A COMMUNICATION TO HER WHICH I WAS PARTICULARLY DESIROUS OF MAKING MYSELF YOU DID NOT SEND MISTER CARTWRIGHT TO HER SAID ROSALIND COLOURING AND LOOKING EARNESTLY IN HIS FACE
4779-85471-0027 NO INDEED I DID NOT DID HE SAY I HAD SENT HIM HOW VERY STRANGE IT IS SHE REPLIED AFTER A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION THAT I SHOULD BE PERFECTLY UNABLE TO SAY WHETHER HE DID OR DID NOT
4779-85471-0028 BUT THIS I DO REMEMBER THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER I UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU HAD DONE SO AND HOW DID HE ANNOUNCE TO MY MOTHER THAT SHE I MEAN HOW DID HE COMMUNICATE TO HER THE PURPORT OF MY FATHER'S WILL
4779-85471-0029 CHARLES MOWBRAY EXCLAIMED ROSALIND PASSIONATELY CLENCHING HER SMALL HANDS AND STAMPING HER LITTLE FOOT UPON THE GROUND I MAY BE A VERY VERY WICKED GIRL I KNOW I AM WILFUL HEADSTRONG OBSTINATE AND VAIN AND CALL ME ALSO DARK MINDED SUSPICIOUS WHAT YOU WILL
4779-85471-0030 BUT I DO HATE THAT MAN HATE WHOM ROSALIND SAID CHARLES INEXPRESSIBLY ASTONISHED AT HER VEHEMENCE WHAT IS IT YOU MEAN IS IT MISTER CARTWRIGHT OUR GOOD FRIENDLY CLERGYMAN THAT YOU HATE SO BITTERLY GO TO YOUR MOTHER MISTER MOWBRAY
4779-85471-0031 I AM LITTLE MORE THAN SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED LESS INSTRUCTED AND THEREFORE SILLIER OF COURSE THAN WAS TO BE EXPECTED EVEN FROM MY AGE AND SEX THEN WILL IT NOT BE WORSE THAN WASTE OF TIME TO INQUIRE WHAT I MEAN
4779-85471-0032 ESPECIALLY WHEN I CONFESS AS I AM BOUND TO DO THAT I DO NOT WELL KNOW MYSELF
4779-85471-0033 YOU AT LEAST HAVE NO CAUSE TO HIDE YOUR FAULTS I WILL GO BUT I WISH I KNEW WHAT HAS SO STRANGELY MOVED YOU ASK YOUR SISTERS THEY SAW AND HEARD ALL THAT I DID AT LEAST THEY WERE PRESENT HERE AS I WAS
4779-85471-0034 ASK THEM EXAMINE THEM BUT ASK ME NOTHING FOR I DO BELIEVE CHARLES THAT I AM LESS TO BE DEPENDED ON THAN ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE WORLD AND WHY SO MY DEAR ROSALIND REPLIED MOWBRAY ALMOST LAUGHING DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU TELL FIBS AGAINST YOUR WILL YES I BELIEVE SO
4779-85471-0035 AT LEAST I FEEL STRANGELY TEMPTED TO SAY A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN I POSITIVELY KNOW TO BE TRUE AND THAT IS VERY MUCH LIKE TELLING FIBS I BELIEVE WELL ROSALIND I WILL GO FOR YOU GROW MORE MYSTERIOUS EVERY MOMENT
4779-85471-0036 ONLY REMEMBER THAT I SHOULD GREATLY LIKE TO KNOW ALL THE THOUGHTS THAT COME INTO THAT STRANGE LITTLE HEAD OF YOURS WILL YOU PROMISE THAT I SHALL NO WAS THE UNGRACIOUS REPLY AND TURNING AWAY SHE LEFT THE ROOM BY A DOOR THAT LED INTO A CONSERVATORY
