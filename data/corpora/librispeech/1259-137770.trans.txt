1259-137770-0000 HOUSES HAVE THEIR OWN WAYS OF DYING FALLING AS VARIOUSLY AS THE GENERATIONS OF MEN SOME WITH A TRAGIC ROAR SOME QUIETLY BUT TO AN AFTER LIFE IN THE CITY OF GHOSTS WHILE FROM OTHERS
1259-137770-0001 AND THUS WAS THE DEATH OF WICKHAM PLACE THE SPIRIT SLIPS BEFORE THE BODY PERISHES IT HAD DECAYED IN THE SPRING DISINTEGRATING THE GIRLS MORE THAN THEY KNEW AND CAUSING EITHER TO ACCOST UNFAMILIAR REGIONS BY SEPTEMBER IT WAS A CORPSE
1259-137770-0002 VOID OF EMOTION AND SCARCELY HALLOWED BY THE MEMORIES OF THIRTY YEARS OF HAPPINESS THROUGH ITS ROUND TOPPED DOORWAY PASSED FURNITURE AND PICTURES AND BOOKS UNTIL THE LAST ROOM WAS GUTTED AND THE LAST VAN HAD RUMBLED AWAY
1259-137770-0003 IT STOOD FOR A WEEK OR TWO LONGER OPEN EYED AS IF ASTONISHED AT ITS OWN EMPTINESS THEN IT FELL NAVVIES CAME AND SPILT IT BACK INTO THE GREY WITH THEIR MUSCLES AND THEIR BEERY GOOD TEMPER
1259-137770-0004 THE FURNITURE WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS WENT DOWN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE MISTER WILCOX HAVING MOST KINDLY OFFERED HOWARDS END AS A WAREHOUSE MISTER BRYCE HAD DIED ABROAD AN UNSATISFACTORY AFFAIR
1259-137770-0005 BUT TIBBY ACCEPTED THE OFFER GLADLY IT SAVED HIM FROM COMING TO ANY DECISION ABOUT THE FUTURE THE PLATE AND THE MORE VALUABLE PICTURES FOUND A SAFER HOME IN LONDON BUT THE BULK OF THE THINGS WENT COUNTRY WAYS AND WERE ENTRUSTED TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF MISS AVERY
1259-137770-0006 SHORTLY BEFORE THE MOVE OUR HERO AND HEROINE WERE MARRIED
1259-137770-0007 TO HAVE NO ILLUSIONS AND YET TO LOVE WHAT STRONGER SURETY CAN A WOMAN FIND SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND'S PAST AS WELL AS HIS HEART SHE KNEW HER OWN HEART WITH A THOROUGHNESS THAT COMMONPLACE PEOPLE BELIEVE IMPOSSIBLE
1259-137770-0008 THE HEART OF MISSUS WILCOX WAS ALONE HIDDEN AND PERHAPS IT IS SUPERSTITIOUS TO SPECULATE ON THE FEELINGS OF THE DEAD THEY WERE MARRIED QUIETLY REALLY QUIETLY FOR AS THE DAY APPROACHED SHE REFUSED TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONITON
1259-137770-0009 HER BROTHER GAVE HER AWAY HER AUNT WHO WAS OUT OF HEALTH PRESIDED OVER A FEW COLOURLESS REFRESHMENTS THE WILCOXES WERE REPRESENTED BY CHARLES WHO WITNESSED THE MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT
1259-137770-0010 PAUL DID SEND A CABLEGRAM IN A FEW MINUTES AND WITHOUT THE AID OF MUSIC THE CLERGYMAN MADE THEM MAN AND WIFE AND SOON THE GLASS SHADE HAD FALLEN THAT CUTS OFF MARRIED COUPLES FROM THE WORLD SHE A MONOGAMIST
1259-137770-0011 REGRETTED THE CESSATION OF SOME OF LIFE'S INNOCENT ODOURS HE WHOSE INSTINCTS WERE POLYGAMOUS FELT MORALLY BRACED BY THE CHANGE AND LESS LIABLE TO THE TEMPTATIONS THAT HAD ASSAILED HIM IN THE PAST THEY SPENT THEIR HONEYMOON NEAR INNSBRUCK
1259-137770-0012 HENRY KNEW OF A RELIABLE HOTEL THERE AND MARGARET HOPED FOR A MEETING WITH HER SISTER IN THIS SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED AS THEY CAME SOUTH HELEN RETREATED OVER THE BRENNER AND WROTE AN UNSATISFACTORY POSTCARD FROM THE SHORES OF THE LAKE OF GARDA
1259-137770-0013 SAYING THAT HER PLANS WERE UNCERTAIN AND HAD BETTER BE IGNORED EVIDENTLY SHE DISLIKED MEETING HENRY TWO MONTHS ARE SURELY ENOUGH TO ACCUSTOM AN OUTSIDER TO A SITUATION WHICH A WIFE HAS ACCEPTED IN TWO DAYS
1259-137770-0014 AND MARGARET HAD AGAIN TO REGRET HER SISTER'S LACK OF SELF CONTROL
1259-137770-0015 SO LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEM IT IS HARD ENOUGH FOR THOSE WHO ARE PERSONALLY TOUCHED TO JUDGE THEN HOW FUTILE MUST BE THE VERDICT OF SOCIETY I DON'T SAY THERE IS NO STANDARD FOR THAT WOULD DESTROY MORALITY
1259-137770-0016 ONLY THAT THERE CAN BE NO STANDARD UNTIL OUR IMPULSES ARE CLASSIFIED AND BETTER UNDERSTOOD HELEN THANKED HER FOR HER KIND LETTER RATHER A CURIOUS REPLY SHE MOVED SOUTH AGAIN AND SPOKE OF WINTERING IN NAPLES
1259-137770-0017 MISTER WILCOX WAS NOT SORRY THAT THE MEETING FAILED HELEN LEFT HIM TIME TO GROW SKIN OVER HIS WOUND THERE WERE STILL MOMENTS WHEN IT PAINED HIM HAD HE ONLY KNOWN THAT MARGARET WAS AWAITING HIM MARGARET SO LIVELY AND INTELLIGENT
1259-137770-0018 AND YET SO SUBMISSIVE HE WOULD HAVE KEPT HIMSELF WORTHIER OF HER INCAPABLE OF GROUPING THE PAST HE CONFUSED THE EPISODE OF JACKY WITH ANOTHER EPISODE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE DAYS OF HIS BACHELORHOOD THE TWO MADE ONE CROP OF WILD OATS
1259-137770-0019 FOR WHICH HE WAS HEARTILY SORRY AND HE COULD NOT SEE THAT THOSE OATS ARE OF A DARKER STOCK WHICH ARE ROOTED IN ANOTHER'S DISHONOUR UNCHASTITY AND INFIDELITY WERE AS CONFUSED TO HIM AS TO THE MIDDLE AGES HIS ONLY MORAL TEACHER
1259-137770-0020 RUTH POOR OLD RUTH DID NOT ENTER INTO HIS CALCULATIONS AT ALL FOR POOR OLD RUTH HAD NEVER FOUND HIM OUT HIS AFFECTION FOR HIS PRESENT WIFE GREW STEADILY HER CLEVERNESS GAVE HIM NO TROUBLE
1259-137770-0021 AND INDEED HE LIKED TO SEE HER READING POETRY OR SOMETHING ABOUT SOCIAL QUESTIONS IT DISTINGUISHED HER FROM THE WIVES OF OTHER MEN HE HAD ONLY TO CALL AND SHE CLAPPED THE BOOK UP AND WAS READY TO DO WHAT HE WISHED THEN THEY WOULD ARGUE SO JOLLILY
1259-137770-0022 AND ONCE OR TWICE SHE HAD HIM IN QUITE A TIGHT CORNER BUT AS SOON AS HE GREW REALLY SERIOUS SHE GAVE IN MAN IS FOR WAR WOMAN FOR THE RECREATION OF THE WARRIOR BUT HE DOES NOT DISLIKE IT IF SHE MAKES A SHOW OF FIGHT
1259-137770-0023 SHE SHOWED HER ANNOYANCE AND ASKED RATHER CROSSLY WHY SHE HAD NOT BEEN CONSULTED I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU HE REPLIED BESIDES I HAVE ONLY HEARD FOR CERTAIN THIS MORNING WHERE ARE WE TO LIVE SAID MARGARET TRYING TO LAUGH
1259-137770-0024 I LOVED THE PLACE EXTRAORDINARILY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IN HAVING A PERMANENT HOME HENRY HE ASSURED HER THAT SHE MISUNDERSTOOD HIM IT IS HOME LIFE THAT DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE FOREIGNER BUT HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN A DAMP HOME THIS IS NEWS
1259-137770-0025 IN THE FIRST PLACE THE GRANGE IS ON CLAY AND BUILT WHERE THE CASTLE MOAT MUST HAVE BEEN
1259-137770-0026 STEAMING ALL NIGHT LIKE A KETTLE FEEL THE CELLAR WALLS LOOK UP UNDER THE EAVES ASK SIR JAMES OR ANYONE THOSE SHROPSHIRE VALLEYS ARE NOTORIOUS THE ONLY POSSIBLE PLACE FOR A HOUSE IN SHROPSHIRE IS ON A HILL
1259-137770-0027 HE DREW HIS HEAD BACK AND GREW RATHER ANGRY WHY HAVE WE COME TO THE TYROL IF IT COMES TO THAT ONE MIGHT GO ON ASKING SUCH QUESTIONS INDEFINITELY ONE MIGHT BUT HE WAS ONLY GAINING TIME FOR A PLAUSIBLE ANSWER
1259-137770-0028 OUT IT CAME AND HE BELIEVED IT AS SOON AS IT WAS SPOKEN THE TRUTH IS I TOOK ONITON ON ACCOUNT OF EVIE DON'T LET THIS GO ANY FURTHER CERTAINLY NOT I SHOULDN'T LIKE HER TO KNOW THAT SHE NEARLY LET ME IN FOR A VERY BAD BARGAIN
1259-137770-0029 NO SOONER DID I SIGN THE AGREEMENT THAN SHE GOT ENGAGED POOR LITTLE GIRL SHE WAS SO KEEN ON IT ALL AND WOULDN'T EVEN WAIT TO MAKE PROPER INQUIRIES ABOUT THE SHOOTING AFRAID IT WOULD GET SNAPPED UP JUST LIKE ALL OF YOUR SEX WELL NO HARM'S DONE
1259-137770-0030 SHE HAS HAD HER COUNTRY WEDDING AND I'VE GOT RID OF MY HOUSE TO SOME FELLOWS WHO ARE STARTING A PREPARATORY SCHOOL WHERE SHALL WE LIVE THEN HENRY I SHOULD ENJOY LIVING SOMEWHERE I HAVE NOT YET DECIDED
1259-137770-0031 MARGARET WAS SILENT MARRIAGE HAD NOT SAVED HER FROM THE SENSE OF FLUX LONDON WAS BUT A FORETASTE OF THIS NOMADIC CIVILIZATION WHICH IS ALTERING HUMAN NATURE SO PROFOUNDLY
1259-137770-0032 AND THROWS UPON PERSONAL RELATIONS A STRESS GREATER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BORNE BEFORE UNDER COSMOPOLITANISM IF IT COMES WE SHALL RECEIVE NO HELP FROM THE EARTH TREES AND MEADOWS AND MOUNTAINS WILL ONLY BE A SPECTACLE
1259-137770-0033 AND THE BINDING FORCE THAT THEY ONCE EXERCISED ON CHARACTER MUST BE ENTRUSTED TO LOVE ALONE MAY LOVE BE EQUAL TO THE TASK IT IS NOW WHAT CONTINUED HENRY
1259-137770-0034 I SEE YOUR POINT SAID MARGARET GETTING UP IF ONITON IS REALLY DAMP IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND MUST BE INHABITED BY LITTLE BOYS ONLY IN THE SPRING LET US LOOK BEFORE WE LEAP
1259-137770-0035 WHAT'S IT BEEN READING THEO THEO HOW MUCH THEOSOPHY
1259-137770-0036 A PLEASANT ENOUGH FATE THE HOUSE BEING ONLY A LITTLE LARGER THAN WICKHAM PLACE TRAINED HER FOR THE IMMENSE ESTABLISHMENT THAT WAS PROMISED IN THE SPRING THEY WERE FREQUENTLY AWAY BUT AT HOME LIFE RAN FAIRLY REGULARLY IN THE MORNING HENRY WENT TO THE BUSINESS
1259-137770-0037 AND HIS SANDWICH A RELIC THIS OF SOME PREHISTORIC CRAVING WAS ALWAYS CUT BY HER OWN HAND HE DID NOT RELY UPON THE SANDWICH FOR LUNCH BUT LIKED TO HAVE IT BY HIM IN CASE HE GREW HUNGRY AT ELEVEN WHEN HE HAD GONE THERE WAS THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER
1259-137770-0038 AND THE SERVANTS TO HUMANIZE AND SEVERAL KETTLES OF HELEN'S TO KEEP ON THE BOIL HER CONSCIENCE PRICKED HER A LITTLE ABOUT THE BASTS SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE LOST SIGHT OF THEM NO DOUBT LEONARD WAS WORTH HELPING BUT BEING HENRY'S WIFE SHE PREFERRED TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE
1259-137770-0039 AS FOR THEATRES AND DISCUSSION SOCIETIES THEY ATTRACTED HER LESS AND LESS SHE BEGAN TO MISS NEW MOVEMENTS AND TO SPEND HER SPARE TIME RE READING OR THINKING RATHER TO THE CONCERN OF HER CHELSEA FRIENDS THEY ATTRIBUTED THE CHANGE TO HER MARRIAGE
1259-137770-0040 AND PERHAPS SOME DEEP INSTINCT DID WARN HER NOT TO TRAVEL FURTHER FROM HER HUSBAND THAN WAS INEVITABLE YET THE MAIN CAUSE LAY DEEPER STILL SHE HAD OUTGROWN STIMULANTS AND WAS PASSING FROM WORDS TO THINGS
