7708-293973-0000 A GIRL SAT AT A DESK IN A SMALL THIRD STORY ROOM OF DOCTOR CHARLES BURNEY'S HOUSE IN LONDON WRITING AS RAPIDLY AS HER QUILL PEN COULD TRAVEL OVER THE PAPER IT WAS A DECEMBER AFTERNOON AND THE LIGHT WAS NOT VERY BRIGHT
7708-293973-0001 SO THAT SHE HAD TO LEAN FAR FORWARD UNTIL THE END OF HER NOSE ALMOST TOUCHED THE TIP OF HER PEN NOW AND THEN A SMILE WOULD CROSS HER LIPS OR SHE WOULD STOP A MOMENT TO REREAD A SENTENCE OR TWO AND NOD HER HEAD BUT FOR THE MOST PART SHE KEPT STEADILY ON
7708-293973-0002 VERY MUCH IN EARNEST IN WHAT SHE WAS DOING ON ONE CORNER OF THE DESK LAY A PILE OF FINISHED MANUSCRIPT SHOWING THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN AT THIS WORK FOR MANY DAYS AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE HAD COME UP TO THIS SMALL SPARE ROOM EVERY AFTERNOON FOR A MONTH
7708-293973-0003 AND WRITTEN UNTIL IT WAS TOO DARK FOR HER TO SEE PRESENTLY ANOTHER GIRL CAME TIPTOEING UP THE STAIRS PAUSED A MOMENT AT THE DOOR AND THEN STOLE QUIETLY INTO THE ROOM
7708-293973-0004 WITHOUT A WORD SHE CROSSED OVER TO AN OLD SOFA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN UPON IT THE WRITER WENT ON DRIVING HER QUILL PEN ACROSS THE PAPER
7708-293973-0005 THERE MY PEN'S STUBBED ITS TOE AGAIN SAID THE WRITER SITTING UP STRAIGHT I'D BETTER LET IT REST ITSELF A WHILE OH FANNY EXCLAIMED THE GIRL ON THE SOFA
7708-293973-0006 THE AUTHORESS LAID DOWN HER PEN AND TILTED BACK IN HER CHAIR THE FUNNIEST THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING TO HER LATELY SUSAN I LAUGHED UNTIL I CRIED
7708-293973-0007 WHEN SUDDENLY A WIND CAME UP AND BLEW OFF HIS WIG
7708-293973-0008 AND THAT PUT HIM OUT SO THAT HE JUMPED UP FROM HIS KNEES AND STALKED AWAY LATER THE GARDENER FOUND THE WIG ON THE BOUGH OF AN APPLE TREE BUT CAROLINE DIDN'T DARE SEND IT TO ITS OWNER
7708-293973-0009 LET ME READ IT TO YOU OH DO FANNY URGED THE YOUNGER SISTER
7708-293973-0010 THEN WITH A PRELIMINARY CHUCKLE SHE BEGAN TO READ AT FIRST SHE WENT SMOOTHLY ENOUGH BUT AFTER A WHILE SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH AND FINALLY SHE HAD TO STOP AND DRY HER EYES WITH A HANDKERCHIEF HE DID LOOK SO RIDICULOUS SHE SAID
7708-293973-0011 CAN'T YOU SEE HIM THERE SAYING OH MY ADORABLE CAROLINE WILT THOU WHEN WHIST
7708-293973-0012 REPLIED SUSAN WHO WAS HUGGING HERSELF AND ROCKING ON THE SOFA WITH APPRECIATION HOWEVER CAN YOU DO IT FANNY
7708-293973-0013 THEY DON'T START OUT FUNNY SAID THE WRITER
7708-293973-0014 OF COURSE THE HERO AND CAROLINE HERSELF ARE QUITE SERIOUS IT'S GETTING TO BE A BIG BOOK JUST LOOK SHE OPENED A DRAWER OF THE DESK AND PRODUCED ANOTHER PILE OF PAPERS AND LAID THEM ON TOP OF THOSE ALREADY ON THE TABLE IT'S ALMOST A FULL SIZED NOVEL NOW
7708-293973-0015 IT'S BEAUTIFUL SAID SUSAN
7708-293973-0016 DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S GOOD
7708-293973-0017 I JUST HAD TO WRITE IT I COULDN'T HELP DOING IT NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED IT'S WONDERFUL CONTINUED THE ADMIRING SUSAN BUT YOU MUSTN'T TELL YOU MUST NEVER TELL BESOUGHT FANNY
7708-293973-0018 I'D BE SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF AND JUST THINK WHAT FATHER MIGHT HAVE TO SAY TO ME ABOUT IT SHE SWUNG ABOUT TO THE DESK AND RESTED HER HEAD IN HER HANDS AS THOUGH TO CONTEMPLATE THE OVERWHELMING THINGS DOCTOR BURNEY MIGHT BE CALLED UPON TO SAY SHOULD HE DISCOVER HER OFFENSE
7708-293973-0019 THEN IMPULSIVELY SHE STRETCHED OUT HER HANDS AND CLASPED THE MANUSCRIPT OH I LOVE IT I LOVE EVERY LINE I'VE WRITTEN THERE SOME ONE ELSE HAD BEEN CLIMBING THE FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO THE THIRD STORY AND NOW CAME INTO THE ROOM
7708-293973-0020 IT WAS MISSUS BURNEY THE STEPMOTHER OF FANNY AND SUSAN SHE WENT OVER TO THE DESK AND LOOKED AT THE PILE OF WRITTEN SHEETS BEFORE FANNY COULD TURN THEM OVER OR HIDE THEM IN THE DRAWER
7708-293973-0021 WRITING BOOKS HAS GONE OUT OF FASHION I KNOW IT SAID FANNY BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT I'D MUCH RATHER DO THIS THAN PRACTICE ON THE HARPSICHORD BUT MUSIC IS A POLITE ACCOMPLISHMENT MY DEAR
7708-293973-0022 WHEREAS SCRIBBLING IS QUITE THE REVERSE FANNY'S ISN'T SCRIBBLING PROTESTED SUSAN IT'S WONDERFUL IT REALLY IS MOTHER IT'S AS GOOD AS ANYTHING DOWN STAIRS IN FATHER'S LIBRARY
7708-293973-0023 NO THANK YOU SUSAN I CAN UNDERSTAND SOME PARENTS LETTING THEIR CHILDREN RUN WILD AND BECOME NOVEL WRITERS BUT NOT DOCTOR BURNEY YOU MUST REMEMBER YOU HAVE A POSITION IN SOCIETY TO THINK ABOUT MY DEARS I KNOW AGREED FANNY GUILTILY
7708-293973-0024 MORE INTERESTING I THINK
7708-293973-0025 MISSUS BURNEY SMILED
7708-293973-0026 SHE WAS A BUSTLING SOCIABLE PERSON AND SHE CONSIDERED THAT FANNY WAS ALTOGETHER TOO SHY AND RESERVED SHE WANTED TO MAKE HER MORE LIKE HER OTHER SISTERS ESTHER AND CHARLOTTE BOTH OF WHOM WERE VERY POPULAR WITH THE MANY VISITORS WHO CAME TO SEE THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR BURNEY
7708-293973-0027 IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD SHE SAID FINALLY I SHAN'T TELL YOUR FATHER BUT I KNOW HE WOULDN'T APPROVE OF YOUR SPENDING YOUR TIME IN THIS WAY I KNOW SAID FANNY SLOWLY I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WRITES
7708-293973-0028 I OUGHTN'T TO DO IT BUT THE TEMPTATION WAS TOO STRONG FOR ME I'LL GIVE IT UP MOTHER AND NOT STEAL OFF HERE BY MYSELF I'LL TRY TO BE MORE THE WAY YOU AND FATHER WANT ME
7708-293973-0029 YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD OF YOU ANYWAY STOOPING DOWN MISSUS BURNEY KISSED HER STEPDAUGHTER AND THEN LEFT THE SISTERS ALONE FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS SILENCE WHILE FANNY STARED AT THE BIG PILE OF CLOSELY WRITTEN SHEETS WHICH LAY IN FRONT OF HER
7708-293973-0030 AND SUSAN LOOKED AT HER SISTER THEN WITH A SIGH THE OLDER GIRL ROSE AND GATHERED THE PAPERS IN HER ARMS MOTHER IS RIGHT IT IS WRONG OF ME SAID SHE WOULD YOU MIND SUSAN COMING DOWN INTO THE YARD WITH ME
7708-293973-0031 ASKED HER SISTER IN ALARM I'VE MADE UP MY MIND WHAT'S BEST TO BE DONE AND I'M GOING TO DO IT COME DOWN STAIRS PLEASE FANNY LED THE WAY WITH THE PAPERS AND SUSAN CAME AFTER HER
7708-293973-0032 THEY WENT DOWN THE THREE FLIGHTS THROUGH A HALL AND OUT INTO A PAVED COURT AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE WILL YOU WATCH THEM A MINUTE PLEASE SAID FANNY AS SHE LAID THE PAPERS ON THE BRICKS SHE WENT INDOORS AND SOON WAS BACK AGAIN WITH SOME STICKS OF WOOD SOME STRAW AND A LIGHTED TAPER IN HER HAND
7708-293973-0033 SHE LAID THE STICKS TOGETHER STUFFED SOME STRAW IN AMONG THEM AND THEN PLACED THE PILE OF PAPERS ON TOP OH FANNY CRIED HER SISTER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BURN UP ALL THE STORY OH POOR CAROLINE DON'T DO IT FANNY
7708-293973-0034 I MUST SAID FANNY VERY DECIDEDLY OH PLEASE PLEASE DON'T
7708-293973-0035 IT IS IT'S A TERRIBLE SHAME IT HURTS ME MOST SAID FANNY BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO SETTLE CAROLINE ONCE FOR ALL WITH A VERY GRIM FACE SHE HELD THE TAPER TO THE STRAW UNTIL IT CAUGHT FIRE
7708-293973-0036 IN A MOMENT A PAGE OF THE MANUSCRIPT WAS CURLING UP IN FLAMES
7708-293973-0037 SHE LOOKED BESEECHINGLY AT HER SISTER BUT THE LATTER'S PURPOSE WAS INFLEXIBLE A FEW MINUTES MORE AND THE PAPERS WERE ALL BURNING BRIGHTLY THE TWO GIRLS STOOD THERE UNTIL THE FIRE HAD BURNT ITSELF OUT AND THEN TURNED TO EACH OTHER
7708-293973-0038 TEARS STOOD IN FANNY'S EYES AND ALSO IN THOSE OF THE SYMPATHETIC SUSAN POOR CAROLINE EVELYN SIGHED FANNY
7708-293973-0039 SUSAN SLIPPED HER ARM ABOUT HER SISTER'S WAIST AND THEY WENT INDOORS TO GET READY FOR SUPPER THE YOUNG AUTHORESS WAS VERY QUIET WHEN THE FAMILY MET AT TABLE A LITTLE LATER AND HAD VERY LITTLE APPETITE BUT THE FAMILY WERE QUITE USED TO FANNY'S RESERVE AND NONE OF THEM THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT IT
7708-293973-0040 EXCEPT THE FAITHFUL SUSAN WHO THREW TENDER REPROACHFUL GLANCES ACROSS THE TABLE AT FANNY FROM TIME TO TIME THE FATHER OF THESE GIRLS DOCTOR CHARLES BURNEY WAS THE FASHIONABLE MUSIC MASTER OF THE DAY IN LONDON
7708-293973-0041 AND OFTEN WAS NOT THROUGH WITH THEM UNTIL ELEVEN AT NIGHT MANY A TIME HE DINED IN A HACKNEY COACH ON SANDWICHES AND A GLASS OF SHERRY AND WATER AS HE DROVE FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER AMONG HIS FRIENDS WERE ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE MUSICIANS ACTORS SCHOLARS
7708-293973-0042 AND AS HE WAS MOST HOSPITABLE HIS CHILDREN GREW UP FAMILIAR WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEN AND WOMEN OF THE GREAT WORLD OF LONDON THE OTHER GIRLS AND THE BOYS WERE LIKE THEIR FATHER IN TAKING PART IN ALL THE ENTERTAINMENTS THAT WENT ON BUT FANNY THE SECOND DAUGHTER
7708-293973-0043 ALTHOUGH SHE WAS ADMITTED TO BE VERY BRIGHT WAS UNUSUALLY QUIET AND RETIRING HER TEACHER CALLED HER THE SILENT OBSERVANT MISS FANNY AND THAT DESCRIBED HER WELL BECAUSE SHE WAS ALWAYS WATCHING THE PEOPLE ABOUT HER AND REMEMBERING THEIR PECULIAR TRICKS OF MANNER AND SPEECH
7708-293973-0044 BUT SHE HAD A MIND OF HER OWN AND COULD SPEAK UP ON OCCASION WHEN SHE WAS TEN YEARS OLD HER FATHER LIVED IN A HOUSE ON POLAND STREET NEXT DOOR TO A WIG MAKER WHO SUPPLIED PERUKES TO THE JUDGES AND LAWYERS OF LONDON
7708-293973-0045 THE CHILDREN OF THE WIG MAKER AND THE BURNEY CHILDREN PLAYED TOGETHER IN A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND THE FORMER'S HOUSE AND ONE DAY THEY WENT INTO THE WIG MAKER'S HOUSE AND EACH PUT ON ONE OF THE FINE WIGS HE HAD FOR SALE
7708-293973-0046 THEN THEY BEGAN TO PLAY IN THE GARDEN UNTIL ONE OF THE PERUKES WHICH WAS VERY FINE AND WORTH OVER TEN GUINEAS FELL INTO A TUB OF WATER AND LOST ALL ITS CURL
7708-293973-0047 THE WIG IS WET TO BE SURE AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD WIG BUT WORDS WILL DO NO GOOD BECAUSE SIR WHAT'S DONE CAN'T BE UNDONE THE WIG MAKER LISTENED IN GREAT SURPRISE AND THEN MADE FANNY A LITTLE BOW MISS BURNEY SPEAKS WITH THE WISDOM OF AGES
7708-293973-0048 HE SAID AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD WENT INTO THE HOUSE
7708-293973-0049 SOMETIMES HE WOULD SIT STILL AND LISTEN TO DOCTOR BURNEY TALK ON THE HISTORY OF MUSIC
7708-293973-0050 HE WOULD SEEM TO BECOME AN OLD CRAFTY MAN BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES OR A VILLAIN FROM THE SLUMS OF LONDON OR A SPANISH GRANDEE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ENGLAND
7708-293973-0051 AND APPEAR IN THE DINING ROOM AS A STRANGER TO THE FAMILY ONCE HE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR IN AN OLD ILL FITTING WIG AND SHABBY CLOTHES AND THE SERVANT REFUSED TO ADMIT HIM TAKING HIM FOR A BEGGAR EGAD CHILD HE SAID TO THE MAID YOU DON'T GUESS WHOM YOU HAVE THE HAPPINESS TO SEE
7708-293973-0052 THE MAID VERY MUCH STARTLED LET HIM PASS AND HE SHAMBLED INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN PRETENDING TO BE A BEGGAR THE CHILDREN WERE ALWAYS DELIGHTED TO HAVE HIM COME AND FANNY IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE SHE HAD A TALENT FOR MIMICKING PEOPLE HERSELF AND SHE LIKED TO STUDY HIM
7708-293973-0053 HE OFTEN SENT THEM TICKETS TO SEE HIM ACT AT DRURY LANE THEATRE
7708-293973-0054 FANNY'S PARTICULAR FRIEND WAS A MISTER SAMUEL CRISP A CURIOUS MAN WHO HAD ONCE BEEN VERY POPULAR IN LONDON
7708-293973-0055 HE WAS VERY FOND OF THE BURNEYS AND OFTEN HAD THEM VISIT HIM AT HIS COUNTRY HOME FANNY CALLED HIM HER DEAREST DADDY
7708-293973-0056 HE UNDERSTOOD HER BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE AND IT WAS TO HIM THAT SHE CONFIDED THE STORY OF HOW SHE HAD BURNED THE MANUSCRIPT OF HER NOVEL IT WAS VERY HARD DADDY SHE SAID I KNOW I OUGHTN'T TO WANT TO KEEP ON SCRIBBLING BUT
7708-293973-0057 SOMEHOW I CAN'T HELP IT I THINK OF SO MANY THINGS AND I WANT TO MAKE THEM REAL AND THE ONLY WAY IS TO PUT THEM DOWN ON PAPER PEOPLE TELL ME YOUNG LADIES SHOULDN'T BE WRITING STORIES THAT IT'S NOT GENTEEL BUT HOW CAN I HELP MYSELF
7708-293973-0058 YOU CAN TELL THEM TO ME FANNY AND NO ONE SHALL EVER KNOW YOU MADE THEM UP SO SHE UNBURDENED HER HEART TO HIM TOLD HIM OF HER FRIEND CAROLINE EVELYN THE DEAR CHILD OF HER BRAIN OF THE SUITORS THAT YOUNG LADY HAD AND HOW SHE TREATED THEM AND OF HER ELOPEMENT TO GRETNA GREEN
7708-293973-0059 MISTER CRISP LISTENED AND SMILED SURPRISED AT THE GIRL'S POWERS OF DESCRIPTION AND HUMOR
7708-293973-0060 SO IT IS SHE ANSWERED I THINK MORE ABOUT HER THAN ABOUT ANY ONE ELSE THEN SAID MISTER CRISP IN SPITE OF YOUR MOTHER'S GOOD ADVICE AND YOUR OWN JUDGMENT
7708-293973-0061 MISTER CRISP WAS RIGHT IN HIS PREDICTION THAT SUMMER THE BURNEYS WENT TO THE LITTLE TOWN OF KING'S LYNN WHERE FANNY HAD BEEN BORN THERE FANNY SHUT HERSELF UP IN A SUMMER HOUSE WHICH WAS CALLED THE CABIN AND BEGAN TO REWRITE HER BOOK
7708-293973-0062 SHE SEIZED UPON EVERY SCRAP OF WHITE PAPER THAT SHE COULD FIND AND BORE IT OFF WITH HER SHE WORKED SECRETLY INVENTING NUMBERLESS EXCUSES FOR THE HOURS SHE SPENT BY HERSELF GRADUALLY THE STORY TOOK SHAPE AGAIN CHANGED IN MANY WAYS FROM ITS FIRST TELLING
7708-293973-0063 AND WITH THE HEROINE RECHRISTENED EVELINA MEANTIME DOCTOR BURNEY HAD STARTED TO PREPARE HIS GREAT HISTORY OF MUSIC AND ASKED THE HELP OF HIS DAUGHTERS TO COPY IT FOR HIM FANNY WROTE THE BEST HAND AND WAS THE MOST RELIABLE
7708-293973-0064 AND DAY AFTER DAY SHE WORKED WITH HIM HAVING TO POSTPONE HER OWN BOOK FROM WEEK TO WEEK BUT EACH TIME SHE CAME BACK TO IT MORE ARDENTLY AND EACH TIME HER PEN FLEW FASTER AS SHE SAT AT HER TABLE IN THE LITTLE SUMMER HOUSE AT LAST SHE TOLD SUSAN ABOUT IT
7708-293973-0065 AND SUSAN WAS DELIGHTED AND WHEN FANNY READ SOME OF IT TO HER SHE DECLARED THAT IT WAS A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THAN THE STORY OF CAROLINE HAD BEEN
7708-293973-0066 AND THIS STIRRED THE YOUTHFUL FANNY WITH THE DESIRE TO SEE WHAT LONDON WOULD THINK OF EVELINA SHE WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER TO KEEP ITS AUTHORSHIP UNKNOWN AND SO SHE CAREFULLY RECOPIED THE MANUSCRIPT IN AN ASSUMED HANDWRITING IN ORDER THAT NO PUBLISHER OR PRINTER
7708-293973-0067 SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE SAME HAND IN THIS BUT EVELINA HAD GROWN TO BE A VERY LONG NOVEL
7708-293973-0068 SHE GREW TIRED AND SO SHE WROTE A LETTER WITHOUT ANY SIGNATURE TO A PUBLISHER OFFERING TO SEND HIM THE COMPLETED PART OF HER NOVEL AT ONCE AND THE REST OF IT DURING THE NEXT YEAR THIS PUBLISHER REPLIED THAT HE WOULD NOT CONSIDER THE BOOK UNLESS HE WERE TOLD THE AUTHOR'S NAME
7708-293973-0069 FANNY SHOWED THE LETTER TO SUSAN AND THEY TALKED IT OVER BUT DECIDED THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO SEND HER NAME
7708-293973-0070 HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MANUSCRIPT THEREUPON FANNY DECIDED TO TAKE HER BROTHER CHARLES INTO THE SECRET AND HAVE HIM CARRY THE WORK TO THE PUBLISHER CHARLES AGREED AND FANNY AND SUSAN MUFFLED HIM UP IN A GREATCOAT SO THAT HE LOOKED MUCH OLDER THAN HE WAS AND SENT HIM OFF
7708-293973-0071 HE WAS NOT RECOGNIZED AND WHEN HE CALLED LATER FOR AN ANSWER HE WAS TOLD THAT THE PUBLISHER WAS PLEASED WITH THE BOOK BUT COULD NOT AGREE TO PRINT IT UNTIL HE SHOULD RECEIVE THE WHOLE STORY THAT DISCOURAGED FANNY AND SHE LET THE BOOK LIE BY FOR SOME TIME
7708-293973-0072 IN THE MEANTIME FANNY BEGAN TO WONDER IF IT WOULD BE FAIR FOR HER TO PUBLISH A NOVEL WITHOUT TELLING HER FATHER AND SHE DECIDED SHE OUGHT TO GO TO HIM SHE CAUGHT HIM JUST AS HE WAS LEAVING HOME ON A TRIP AND SAID WITH MANY BLUSHES AND MUCH CONFUSION
7708-293973-0073 THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN A LITTLE STORY AND WANTED TO HAVE IT PRINTED WITHOUT GIVING HER NAME SHE ADDED THAT SHE WOULD NOT BOTHER HIM WITH THE MANUSCRIPT IN ANY WAY AND BEGGED THAT HE WOULDN'T ASK TO SEE IT THE DOCTOR WAS VERY MUCH AMUSED AS WELL AS SURPRISED AND HE TOLD HER TO GO AHEAD AND SEE WHAT WOULD COME OF THE STORY
7708-293973-0074 BETTER SATISFIED NOW THAT SHE HAD HER FATHER'S CONSENT
7708-293973-0075 THE FIRST FANNY KNEW OF IT WAS WHEN HER STEPMOTHER OPENED A PAPER ONE MORNING AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND READ ALOUD AN ADVERTISEMENT ANNOUNCING THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW NOVEL ENTITLED EVELINA OR A YOUNG LADY'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD
7708-293973-0076 SUSAN SMILED ACROSS THE TABLE AT FANNY AND CHARLES WINKED AT HER BUT SHE SAT VERY STILL HER CHEEKS A FIERY RED
7708-293973-0077 SHORTLY AFTERWARD FANNY WAS ILL AND WENT OUT TO CHESINGTON TO RECUPERATE SHE TOOK THE THREE VOLUMES OF EVELINA WITH HER AND READ THEM ALOUD TO MISTER CRISP WHO PRETENDED THAT HE HAD NO IDEA WHO THE AUTHOR MIGHT BE
7708-293973-0078 AND LISTENED WITH THE MOST FLATTERING INTEREST TO CHAPTER AFTER CHAPTER IT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING HE SAID ONE DAY AND WHAT MAY THAT BE DEAR DADDY SHE ASKED I CAN'T THINK BUT IT'S PRODIGIOUSLY FINER THAN WHAT I'M TRYING TO RECALL HE ANSWERED
7708-293973-0079 BY THE TIME SHE RETURNED HOME ALL LONDON WAS TALKING ABOUT THE NEW NOVEL AND WONDERING AS TO THE AUTHOR WHEREVER DOCTOR BURNEY WENT HE FOUND PEOPLE DISCUSSING THE SAME SUBJECT THE GREAT DOCTOR SAMUEL JOHNSON DECLARED THAT IT WAS UNCOMMONLY FINE
7708-293973-0080 AND THE DOCTOR WAS THE ACCEPTED JUDGE OF ALL LITERARY MATTERS LIKE ALL THE OTHERS HE WAS SURE THAT THE WRITER WAS A MAN AND MADE MANY GUESSES AS TO WHICH OF THE LIGHTS OF LONDON IT MIGHT BE BUT ALTHOUGH ONE MAN AFTER ANOTHER WAS CREDITED WITH THE HONOR OF HAVING WRITTEN IT EACH HAD TO DECLINE THE SATISFACTION
7708-293973-0081 SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS DECLARED HE WOULD GIVE FIFTY POUNDS TO KNOW THE AUTHOR AND MEANT TO FIND HIM AND SHERIDAN VOWED HE MUST GET THE CLEVER MAN WHOEVER HE WAS TO WRITE HIM A PLAY IN THE MEANTIME FANNY AND SUSAN WERE ENJOYING THE MYSTERY TREMENDOUSLY
7708-293973-0082 IT WAS VERY DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR ALL THE VISITORS AT THEIR HOUSE TALKING OF EVELINA WITHOUT THE FAINTEST NOTION THAT THE AUTHOR WAS SITTING THERE LISTENING TO ALL THEY HAD TO SAY BUT THE TIME CAME WHEN DOCTOR BURNEY LEARNED THE SECRET AND HIS PRIDE IN FANNY'S ACCOMPLISHMENT COULD NOT KEEP HIM SILENT
7708-293973-0083 HE TOLD THE STORY TO SEVERAL OF HIS FRIENDS AND THEY VERY MUCH AMAZED PASSED IT ON TO OTHERS THEN MISSUS THRALE A FRIEND OF THE BURNEYS GAVE A DINNER AND TOLD HER GUESTS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING THE AUTHOR OF EVELINA THERE
7708-293973-0084 SHE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH CONGRATULATIONS AND WHEN THE PARTY CAME TO AN END SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS WITH A MOST COURTLY BOW BENT OVER HER HAND AND HOPED THAT HE MIGHT SHORTLY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ENTERTAINING HER AT HIS HOME IN
7708-293973-0085 WHEN SHE WENT HOME FANNY SAID TO SUSAN THE JOKE OF IT IS THAT THE PEOPLE SPOKE AS IF THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME INSTEAD OF MY BEING VERY MUCH AFRAID OF THEM EVELINA MADE FANNY BURNEY FAMOUS
7708-293973-0086 SHE BECAME A WELL KNOWN FIGURE IN LONDON LIFE AND WROTE OTHER NOVELS CECILIA CAMILLA AND THE WANDERER SHE WROTE A LIFE OF DOCTOR BURNEY AND SHE KEPT MANY DIARIES ALL OF WHICH WERE FILLED WITH WITTY AND HUMOROUS DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF HER AGE
7708-293973-0087 AND TOOK A PROMINENT PART AT COURT LATER SHE MARRIED THE FRENCH
7708-293973-0088 SHE AFTERWARD DESCRIBED THESE ADVENTURES IN HER DIARY AND IT GIVES A MOST INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THOSE THRILLING TIMES SO IT WAS THAT THE SILENT OBSERVANT MISS FANNY
