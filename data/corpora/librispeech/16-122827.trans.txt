16-122827-0000 FINALLY THE MORNING DAWNED PEARLY AND LUSTROUS IN A SKY FULL OF SILVER SHEEN AND RADIANCE AND THE WONDERFUL DAY HAD ARRIVED DIANA APPEARED SOON AFTER BREAKFAST WITH A BASKET OF FLOWERS OVER ONE ARM AND HER MUSLIN DRESS OVER THE OTHER
16-122827-0001 FOR IT WOULD NOT DO TO DON IT UNTIL ALL THE DINNER PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETED MEANWHILE SHE WORE HER AFTERNOON PINK PRINT AND A LAWN APRON FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY RUFFLED AND FRILLED AND VERY NEAT AND PRETTY AND ROSY SHE WAS
16-122827-0002 YOU LOOK SIMPLY SWEET SAID ANNE ADMIRINGLY DIANA SIGHED
16-122827-0003 WELL LET'S FORGET OUR TROUBLES AND THINK OF OUR MERCIES SAID ANNE GAILY MISSUS ALLAN SAYS THAT WHENEVER WE THINK OF ANYTHING THAT IS A TRIAL TO US WE SHOULD ALSO THINK OF SOMETHING NICE THAT WE CAN SET OVER AGAINST IT IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY TOO PLUMP
16-122827-0004 YOU'VE GOT THE DEAREST DIMPLES AND IF I HAVE A FRECKLED NOSE THE SHAPE OF IT IS ALL RIGHT
16-122827-0005 WHICH WAS FULL OF AIRY SHADOWS AND WAVERING GOLDEN LIGHTS WE'LL DECORATE THE PARLOR FIRST WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
16-122827-0006 SO WE'LL HAVE DINNER AT ONE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN TWO HAPPIER AND MORE EXCITED GIRLS SOMEWHERE IN CANADA OR THE UNITED STATES AT THAT MOMENT BUT I DOUBT IT EVERY SNIP OF THE SCISSORS AS ROSE AND PEONY AND BLUEBELL FELL
16-122827-0007 MISSUS MORGAN IS COMING TODAY ANNE WONDERED HOW MISTER HARRISON COULD GO ON PLACIDLY MOWING HAY IN THE FIELD ACROSS THE LANE JUST AS IF NOTHING WERE GOING TO HAPPEN THE PARLOR AT GREEN GABLES WAS A RATHER SEVERE AND GLOOMY APARTMENT
16-122827-0008 EXCEPT AT SUCH TIMES AS THEY CLUNG TO UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE'S BUTTONS EVEN ANNE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO INFUSE MUCH GRACE INTO IT FOR MARILLA WOULD NOT PERMIT ANY ALTERATIONS BUT IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT FLOWERS CAN ACCOMPLISH IF YOU GIVE THEM A FAIR CHANCE
16-122827-0009 WHEN ANNE AND DIANA FINISHED WITH THE ROOM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED IT A GREAT BLUE BOWLFUL OF SNOWBALLS OVERFLOWED ON THE POLISHED TABLE THE SHINING BLACK MANTELPIECE WAS HEAPED WITH ROSES AND FERNS EVERY SHELF OF THE WHAT NOT
16-122827-0010 HELD A SHEAF OF BLUEBELLS THE DARK CORNERS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE GRATE WERE LIGHTED UP WITH JARS FULL OF GLOWING CRIMSON PEONIES AND THE GRATE ITSELF WAS AFLAME WITH YELLOW POPPIES
16-122827-0011 MADE OF THE USUALLY DISMAL LITTLE ROOM
16-122827-0012 AND EVEN EXTORTED A TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION FROM MARILLA WHO CAME IN TO CRITICIZE AND REMAINED TO PRAISE NOW WE MUST SET THE TABLE SAID ANNE IN THE TONE OF A PRIESTESS ABOUT TO PERFORM SOME SACRED RITE IN HONOR OF A DIVINITY
16-122827-0013 WE'LL HAVE A BIG VASEFUL OF WILD ROSES IN THE CENTER AND ONE SINGLE ROSE IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY'S PLATE AND A SPECIAL BOUQUET OF ROSEBUDS ONLY BY MISSUS MORGAN'S AN ALLUSION TO THE ROSEBUD GARDEN YOU KNOW
16-122827-0014 THE TABLE WAS SET IN THE SITTING ROOM WITH MARILLA'S FINEST LINEN AND THE BEST CHINA GLASS AND SILVER YOU MAY BE PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT EVERY ARTICLE PLACED ON IT WAS POLISHED OR SCOURED TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PERFECTION OF GLOSS AND GLITTER
16-122827-0015 WHERE THE CHICKENS WERE ALREADY SIZZLING SPLENDIDLY ANNE PREPARED THE POTATOES AND DIANA GOT THE PEAS AND BEANS READY THEN WHILE DIANA SHUT HERSELF INTO THE PANTRY TO COMPOUND THE LETTUCE SALAD ANNE WHOSE CHEEKS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO GLOW CRIMSON
16-122827-0016 NOBODY OBJECTED TO THIS AT HALF PAST ELEVEN THE LETTUCE SALAD WAS MADE THE GOLDEN CIRCLES OF THE PIES WERE HEAPED WITH WHIPPED CREAM AND EVERYTHING WAS SIZZLING AND BUBBLING THAT OUGHT TO SIZZLE AND BUBBLE WE'D BETTER GO AND DRESS NOW SAID ANNE FOR THEY MAY BE HERE BY TWELVE
16-122827-0017 THANKS EITHER TO THE LEMON JUICE OR TO THE UNUSUAL FLUSH ON HER CHEEKS WHEN THEY WERE READY THEY LOOKED QUITE AS SWEET AND TRIM AND GIRLISH AS EVER DID ANY OF MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES I DO HOPE I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING ONCE IN A WHILE
16-122827-0018 AND NOT SIT LIKE A MUTE SAID DIANA ANXIOUSLY ALL MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES CONVERSE SO BEAUTIFULLY BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL BE TONGUE TIED AND STUPID AND I'LL BE SURE TO SAY I SEEN I HAVEN'T OFTEN SAID IT SINCE MISS STACY TAUGHT HERE
16-122827-0019 BUT IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT IT'S SURE TO POP OUT ANNE IF I WERE TO SAY I SEEN BEFORE MISSUS MORGAN I'D DIE OF MORTIFICATION AND IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD TO HAVE NOTHING TO SAY I'M NERVOUS ABOUT A GOOD MANY THINGS SAID ANNE
16-122827-0020 BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH FEAR THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK AND TO DO HER JUSTICE THERE WASN'T ANNE SHROUDED HER MUSLIN GLORIES IN A BIG APRON AND WENT DOWN TO CONCOCT HER SOUP MARILLA HAD DRESSED HERSELF AND THE TWINS
16-122827-0021 AND LOOKED MORE EXCITED THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO LOOK BEFORE AT HALF PAST TWELVE THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY CAME EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL BUT ANNE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL NERVOUS IT WAS SURELY TIME FOR PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN TO ARRIVE
16-122827-0022 SHE MADE FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE GATE AND LOOKED AS ANXIOUSLY DOWN THE LANE AS EVER HER NAMESAKE IN THE BLUEBEARD STORY PEERED FROM THE TOWER CASEMENT SUPPOSE THEY DON'T COME AT ALL SHE SAID PITEOUSLY DON'T SUPPOSE IT
16-122827-0023 SAID DIANA WHO HOWEVER WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE UNCOMFORTABLE MISGIVINGS ON THE SUBJECT ANNE SAID MARILLA COMING OUT FROM THE PARLOR
16-122827-0024 SHE HAD IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER PROMISE TO MISSUS LYNDE WRITTEN TO MISS BARRY OF CHARLOTTETOWN ASKING FOR THE LOAN OF IT MISS BARRY WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF ANNE'S AND SHE PROMPTLY SENT THE PLATTER OUT WITH A LETTER EXHORTING ANNE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF IT
16-122827-0025 FOR SHE HAD PAID TWENTY DOLLARS FOR IT THE PLATTER HAD SERVED ITS PURPOSE AT THE AID BAZAAR AND HAD THEN BEEN RETURNED TO THE GREEN GABLES CLOSET FOR ANNE WOULD NOT TRUST ANYBODY BUT HERSELF TO TAKE IT BACK TO TOWN
16-122827-0026 SHE CARRIED THE PLATTER CAREFULLY TO THE FRONT DOOR WHERE HER GUESTS WERE ENJOYING THE COOL BREEZE THAT BLEW UP FROM THE BROOK IT WAS EXAMINED AND ADMIRED THEN JUST AS ANNE HAD TAKEN IT BACK INTO HER OWN HANDS A TERRIFIC CRASH AND CLATTER SOUNDED FROM THE KITCHEN PANTRY
16-122827-0027 MARILLA DIANA AND ANNE FLED OUT THE LATTER PAUSING ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO SET THE PRECIOUS PLATTER HASTILY DOWN ON THE SECOND STEP OF THE STAIRS WHEN THEY REACHED THE PANTRY A TRULY HARROWING SPECTACLE MET THEIR EYES
16-122827-0028 WHERE HE ALREADY KEPT A SCORE OR SO OF SIMILAR BALLS WHICH SO FAR AS COULD BE DISCOVERED
16-122827-0029 DAVY HAD TO CLIMB ON THE TABLE AND REACH OVER TO THE SHELF AT A DANGEROUS ANGLE SOMETHING HE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN BY MARILLA TO DO AS HE HAD COME TO GRIEF ONCE BEFORE IN THE EXPERIMENT THE RESULT IN THIS INSTANCE WAS DISASTROUS
16-122827-0030 DAVY SLIPPED AND CAME SPRAWLING SQUARELY DOWN ON THE LEMON PIES HIS CLEAN BLOUSE WAS RUINED FOR THAT TIME AND THE PIES FOR ALL TIME IT IS HOWEVER AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY GOOD
16-122827-0031 SAID MARILLA PUSHING HIM TOWARD THE HALL WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR DESSERT ASKED ANNE LOOKING REGRETFULLY AT THE WRECK AND RUIN GET OUT A CROCK OF STRAWBERRY PRESERVES SAID MARILLA CONSOLINGLY
16-122827-0032 BUT COULDN'T BE DEPENDED ON TO REMAIN SO FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE COMING AFTER ALL SAID MARILLA CROSSLY ANNE AND DIANA SOUGHT COMFORT IN EACH OTHER'S EYES AT HALF PAST ONE MARILLA AGAIN EMERGED FROM THE PARLOR
16-122827-0033 GIRLS WE MUST HAVE DINNER EVERYBODY IS HUNGRY AND IT'S NO USE WAITING ANY LONGER PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN ARE NOT COMING THAT'S PLAIN AND NOTHING IS BEING IMPROVED BY WAITING ANNE AND DIANA SET ABOUT LIFTING THE DINNER
16-122827-0034 WITH ALL THE ZEST GONE OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL BE ABLE TO EAT A MOUTHFUL SAID DIANA DOLEFULLY NOR I
16-122827-0035 I PUT A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR IN WE ALWAYS DO DON'T YOU LIKE IT
16-122827-0036 SAID MARILLA WHO HAD LISTENED TO THIS DIALOGUE WITH A RATHER GUILTY EXPRESSION I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D REMEMBER ABOUT THE SUGAR ANNE FOR I'M PERFECTLY CERTAIN YOU NEVER DID BEFORE SO I PUT IN A SPOONFUL
16-122827-0037 LET'S CARRY THE THINGS IN AND GET IT OVER IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THAT DINNER WAS A NOTABLE SUCCESS SOCIALLY THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY EXERTED THEMSELVES TO SAVE THE SITUATION AND MARILLA'S CUSTOMARY PLACIDITY WAS NOT NOTICEABLY RUFFLED
16-122827-0038 BUT ANNE AND DIANA BETWEEN THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND THE REACTION FROM THEIR EXCITEMENT OF THE FORENOON COULD NEITHER TALK NOR EAT ANNE TRIED HEROICALLY TO BEAR HER PART IN THE CONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF HER GUESTS BUT ALL THE SPARKLE HAD BEEN QUENCHED IN HER FOR THE TIME BEING
16-122827-0039 AND IN SPITE OF HER LOVE FOR THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY SHE COULDN'T HELP THINKING HOW NICE IT WOULD BE WHEN EVERYBODY HAD GONE HOME AND SHE COULD BURY HER WEARINESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE PILLOWS OF THE EAST GABLE THERE IS AN OLD PROVERB THAT REALLY SEEMS AT TIMES TO BE INSPIRED
16-122827-0040 IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS THE MEASURE OF THAT DAY'S TRIBULATIONS WAS NOT YET FULL JUST AS MISTER ALLAN HAD FINISHED RETURNING THANKS THERE AROSE A STRANGE OMINOUS SOUND ON THE STAIRS AS OF SOME HARD HEAVY OBJECT BOUNDING FROM STEP TO STEP
16-122827-0041 FINISHING UP WITH A GRAND SMASH AT THE BOTTOM EVERYBODY RAN OUT INTO THE HALL
16-122827-0042 I SET THAT PLATTER THERE AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT I AM PROPERLY PUNISHED FOR MY CARELESSNESS BUT OH WHAT WILL MISS BARRY SAY WELL YOU KNOW SHE ONLY BOUGHT IT SO IT ISN'T THE SAME AS IF IT WAS AN HEIRLOOM
16-122827-0043 SAID DIANA TRYING TO CONSOLE THE GUESTS WENT AWAY SOON AFTER FEELING THAT IT WAS THE MOST TACTFUL THING TO DO AND ANNE AND DIANA WASHED THE DISHES TALKING LESS THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO DO BEFORE THEN DIANA WENT HOME WITH A HEADACHE
16-122827-0044 AND OH ANNE DEAR
16-122827-0045 FOR BY THE TIME AUNTY'S ANKLE IS WELL SHE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO TORONTO SHE HAS TO BE THERE BY A CERTAIN DATE WELL SIGHED ANNE
16-122827-0046 WHILE THE TWILIGHT RAINED DOWN OUT OF A DAPPLED SKY I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THAT MISSUS MORGAN SHOULD REALLY COME BUT THERE THAT SPEECH SOUNDS AS PESSIMISTIC AS MISS ELIZA ANDREWS AND I'M ASHAMED OF MAKING IT
16-122827-0047 AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THINGS JUST AS GOOD AND FAR BETTER ARE COMING TRUE FOR ME ALL THE TIME AND I SUPPOSE THE EVENTS OF TODAY HAVE A FUNNY SIDE TOO PERHAPS WHEN DIANA AND I ARE OLD AND GRAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO LAUGH OVER THEM
16-122827-0048 FOR IT HAS TRULY BEEN A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD MANY MORE AND WORSE DISAPPOINTMENTS THAN THAT BEFORE YOU GET THROUGH LIFE
16-122827-0049 IT SEEMS TO ME ANNE THAT YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO OUTGROW YOUR FASHION OF SETTING YOUR HEART SO ON THINGS AND THEN CRASHING DOWN INTO DESPAIR BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THEM I KNOW I'M TOO MUCH INCLINED THAT WAY AGREED ANNE RUEFULLY
16-122827-0050 I THINK IT ALMOST PAYS FOR THE THUD WELL MAYBE IT DOES ADMITTED MARILLA I'D RATHER WALK CALMLY ALONG AND DO WITHOUT BOTH FLYING AND THUD BUT EVERYBODY HAS HER OWN WAY OF LIVING I USED TO THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY
16-122827-0051 BUT SINCE I'VE HAD YOU AND THE TWINS TO BRING UP I DON'T FEEL SO SURE OF IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MISS BARRY'S PLATTER PAY HER BACK THE TWENTY DOLLARS SHE PAID FOR IT I SUPPOSE I'M SO THANKFUL IT WASN'T A CHERISHED HEIRLOOM BECAUSE THEN NO MONEY COULD REPLACE IT
16-122827-0052 MAYBE YOU COULD FIND ONE LIKE IT SOMEWHERE AND BUY IT FOR HER I'M AFRAID NOT PLATTERS AS OLD AS THAT ARE VERY SCARCE MISSUS LYNDE COULDN'T FIND ONE ANYWHERE FOR THE SUPPER I ONLY WISH I COULD FOR OF COURSE MISS BARRY WOULD JUST AS SOON HAVE ONE PLATTER AS ANOTHER
16-122827-0053 IF BOTH WERE EQUALLY OLD AND GENUINE MARILLA LOOK AT THAT BIG STAR OVER MISTER HARRISON'S MAPLE GROVE WITH ALL THAT HOLY HUSH OF SILVERY SKY ABOUT IT IT GIVES ME A FEELING THAT IS LIKE A PRAYER AFTER ALL WHEN ONE CAN SEE STARS AND SKIES LIKE THAT
16-122827-0054 WHERE'S DAVY SAID MARILLA WITH AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE AT THE STAR IN BED
16-122827-0055 OF COURSE THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS THAT HE MUST BE GOOD BUT HE TRIED TO BE GOOD AND I HADN'T THE HEART TO DISAPPOINT HIM YOU'LL DROWN YOURSELF OR THE TWINS ROWING ABOUT THE POND IN THAT FLAT GRUMBLED MARILLA
16-122827-0056 I'VE LIVED HERE FOR SIXTY YEARS AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THE POND YET WELL IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND SAID ANNE ROGUISHLY SUPPOSE YOU COME WITH US TOMORROW WE'LL SHUT GREEN GABLES UP AND SPEND THE WHOLE DAY AT THE SHORE DAFFING THE WORLD ASIDE
16-122827-0057 DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN THE GOSSIP THAT MISTER HARRISON IS GOING TO SEE ISABELLA ANDREWS NO I'M SURE THERE ISN'T HE JUST CALLED THERE ONE EVENING ON BUSINESS WITH MISTER HARMON ANDREWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAW HIM AND SAID SHE KNEW HE WAS COURTING BECAUSE HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON
16-122827-0058 I DON'T BELIEVE MISTER HARRISON WILL EVER MARRY HE SEEMS TO HAVE A PREJUDICE AGAINST MARRIAGE WELL YOU CAN NEVER TELL ABOUT THOSE OLD BACHELORS AND IF HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON I'D AGREE WITH RACHEL THAT IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS
16-122827-0059 I THINK HE ONLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE HE WANTED TO CONCLUDE A BUSINESS DEAL WITH HARMON ANDREWS SAID ANNE I'VE HEARD HIM SAY THAT'S THE ONLY TIME A MAN NEEDS TO BE PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE BECAUSE IF HE LOOKS PROSPEROUS THE PARTY OF THE SECOND PART WON'T BE SO LIKELY TO TRY TO CHEAT HIM
16-122827-0060 I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR MISTER HARRISON
