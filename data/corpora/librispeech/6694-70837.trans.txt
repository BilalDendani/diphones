6694-70837-0079 THIS WILL BECOME MUCH CLEARER TO YOU IF YOU WILL RECOLLECT THAT I AM A MEMBER OF THE TSAY EE KAH AND THAT AT THIS VERY MOMENT OUR PARTY COMRADES ARE IN THE WINTER PALACE UNDER BOMBARDMENT

6694-70837-0087 PEOPLE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY TOWARD THE CLOUDED WINDOWS AND A SORT OF FEVER CAME OVER THEM MARTOV DEMANDING THE FLOOR CROAKED HOARSELY THE CIVIL WAR IS BEGINNING COMRADES
6694-70837-0088 THE FIRST QUESTION MUST BE A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF THE CRISIS ON PRINCIPLE AND FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT WE MUST URGENTLY DISCUSS A MEANS OF AVERTING CIVIL WAR
6694-70837-0089 OUR BROTHERS ARE BEING SHOT DOWN IN THE STREETS AT THIS MOMENT WHEN BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS THE QUESTION OF POWER IS BEING SETTLED BY MEANS OF A MILITARY PLOT
6694-70837-0090 IS THE QUESTION OF POWER AND THIS QUESTION IS ALREADY BEING SETTLED BY FORCE OF ARMS IN THE STREETS WE MUST CREATE A POWER WHICH WILL BE RECOGNISED BY THE WHOLE DEMOCRACY
6694-70837-0091 THE POSSIBILITY OF A PEACEFUL OUTCOME LIES IN THE FORMATION OF A UNITED DEMOCRATIC AUTHORITY WE MUST ELECT A DELEGATION TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE OTHER SOCIALIST PARTIES AND ORGANISATION
6694-70837-0092 AND IT IS BEING SETTLED BEHIND OUR BACKS BEFORE THE CONGRESS OPENS BLOWS ARE BEING STRUCK AGAINST THE WINTER PALACE AND IT IS BY SUCH BLOWS THAT THE NAILS ARE BEING DRIVEN INTO THE COFFIN OF THE POLITICAL PARTY WHICH HAS RISKED SUCH AN ADVENTURE UPROAR
6694-70837-0093 FOLLOWED HIM GHARRA WHILE WE ARE HERE DISCUSSING PROPOSITIONS OF PEACE THERE IS A BATTLE ON IN THE STREETS THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE MENSHEVIKI REFUSE TO BE INVOLVED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING
6694-70837-0094 AND CALL UPON ALL PUBLIC FORCES TO RESIST THE ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE THE POWER KUTCHIN DELEGATE OF THE TWELFTH ARMY AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TROUDOVIKI I WAS SENT HERE ONLY FOR INFORMATION AND I AM RETURNING AT ONCE TO THE FRONT
6694-70837-0095 WHERE ALL THE ARMY COMMITTEES CONSIDER THAT THE TAKING OF POWER BY THE SOVIETS ONLY THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS A STAB IN THE BACK OF THE ARMY AND A CRIME AGAINST THE PEOPLE SHOUTS OF LIE YOU LIE
6694-70837-0096 WHEN HE COULD BE HEARD AGAIN LET'S MAKE AN END OF THIS ADVENTURE IN PETROGRAD
6694-70837-0097 AS HE WENT DOWN THE AISLE IN THE MIDST OF A DEAFENING NOISE PEOPLE SURGED IN UPON HIM THREATENING THEN KHINTCHUK AN OFFICER WITH A LONG BROWN GOATEE SPEAKING SUAVELY AND PERSUASIVELY
6694-70837-0098 I SPEAK FOR THE DELEGATES FROM THE FRONT THE ARMY IS IMPERFECTLY REPRESENTED IN THIS CONGRESS AND FURTHERMORE THE ARMY DOES NOT CONSIDER THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS NECESSARY AT THIS TIME ONLY THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE CONSTITUENT
6694-70837-0099 SHOUTS AND STAMPING ALWAYS GROWING MORE VIOLENT THE ARMY DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HAS THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY SOLDIERS BEGAN TO STAND UP ALL OVER THE HALL WHO ARE YOU SPEAKING FOR WHAT DO YOU REPRESENT
6694-70837-0100 THEY CRIED THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOVIET OF THE FIFTH ARMY THE SECOND F REGIMENT THE FIRST N REGIMENT THE THIRD S RIFLES WHEN WERE YOU ELECTED YOU REPRESENT THE OFFICERS NOT THE SOLDIERS

6694-70837-0103 WHICH WOULD FIND SUPPORT IN ALL STRATA OF SOCIETY HE COULD NOT PROCEED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES RAISING HIS VOICE TO A SHOUT HE READ THE MENSHEVIK DECLARATION
6694-70837-0104 BECAUSE THE BOLSHEVIKI HAVE MADE A MILITARY CONSPIRACY WITH THE AID OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WITHOUT CONSULTING THE OTHER FACTIONS AND PARTIES WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REMAIN IN THE CONGRESS AND THEREFORE WITHDRAW
6694-70837-0105 HENDELMAN FOR THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES COULD BE HEARD PROTESTING AGAINST THE BOMBARDMENT OF THE WINTER PALACE WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS KIND OF ANARCHY SCARCELY HAD HE STEPPED DOWN THAN A YOUNG LEAN FACED SOLDIER

6694-70837-0107 I SPEAK FOR THE SECOND LETTISH RIFLES YOU HAVE HEARD THE STATEMENTS OF TWO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ARMY COMMITTEES THESE STATEMENTS WOULD HAVE SOME VALUE
6694-70837-0108 OUR COMMITTEE REFUSED TO CALL A MEETING OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MASSES UNTIL THE END OF SEPTEMBER SO THAT THE REACTIONARIES COULD ELECT THEIR OWN FALSE DELEGATES TO THIS CONGRESS I TELL YOU NOW
6694-70837-0109 THE LETTISH SOLDIERS HAVE MANY TIMES SAID NO MORE RESOLUTIONS NO MORE TALK
6694-70837-0110 THE POWER MUST BE IN OUR HANDS LET THESE IMPOSTOR DELEGATES LEAVE THE CONGRESS THE ARMY IS NOT WITH THEM THE HALL ROCKED WITH CHEERING IN THE FIRST MOMENTS OF THE SESSION
6694-70837-0111 STUNNED BY THE RAPIDITY OF EVENTS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF CANNON THE DELEGATES HAD HESITATED FOR AN HOUR HAMMER BLOW AFTER HAMMER BLOW HAD FALLEN FROM THAT TRIBUNE WELDING THEM TOGETHER BUT BEATING THEM DOWN
6694-70837-0112 DID THEY STAND THEN ALONE WAS RUSSIA RISING AGAINST THEM WAS IT TRUE THAT THE ARMY WAS MARCHING ON PETROGRAD THEN THIS CLEAR EYED YOUNG SOLDIER HAD SPOKEN
