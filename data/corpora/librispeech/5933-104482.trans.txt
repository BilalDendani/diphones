5933-104482-0000 AUGUSTUS HAS HIS OWN DOUBTS THAT'S AN IMPERTINENT YOUNG PUPPY SAID SEPTIMUS JONES AS SOON AS THE FLY WHICH WAS TO CARRY HARRY ANNESLEY TO THE STATION HAD LEFT THE HALL DOOR ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
5933-104482-0001 IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT MISTER JONES WOULD NOT THUS HAVE EXPRESSED HIMSELF UNLESS HIS FRIEND AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH HAD DROPPED CERTAIN WORDS IN CONVERSATION IN REGARD TO HARRY TO THE SAME EFFECT
5933-104482-0002 AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH HAD MADE UP HIS MIND LOOKING AT THE MATTER ALL ROUND THAT MORE WAS TO BE GOT BY ABUSING HARRY THAN BY PRAISING HIM THE YOUNG MAN HAS A GOOD OPINION OF HIMSELF CERTAINLY
5933-104482-0003 HE THINKS HIMSELF TO BE A DEAL BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE CONTINUED JONES WHEREAS I FOR ONE DON'T SEE IT AND HE HAS A WAY WITH HIM OF PRETENDING TO BE QUITE EQUAL TO HIS COMPANIONS LET THEM BE WHO THEY MAY WHICH TO ME IS ODIOUS
5933-104482-0004 HE WAS DOWN UPON YOU AND DOWN UPON YOUR FATHER OF COURSE YOUR FATHER HAS MADE A MOST FRAUDULENT ATTEMPT BUT WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT TO HIM THE OTHER YOUNG MAN MADE NO ANSWER BUT ONLY SMILED
5933-104482-0005 THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY MISTER JONES AS TO HARRY ANNESLEY HAD ONLY BEEN A REFLEX OF THAT FELT BY AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH BUT THE REFLEX AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE WHEN THE LOOKING GLASS IS TRUE WAS CORRECT
5933-104482-0006 SCARBOROUGH HAD KNOWN HARRY ANNESLEY FOR A LONG TIME AS TIME IS COUNTED IN EARLY YOUTH AND HAD BY DEGREES LEARNED TO HATE HIM THOROUGHLY
5933-104482-0007 HE WAS A LITTLE THE ELDER AND HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT TO DOMINEER OVER HIS FRIEND BUT THE FRIEND HAD RESISTED AND HAD STRUGGLED MANFULLY TO ACHIEVE WHAT HE CONSIDERED AN EQUALITY IN FRIENDSHIP
5933-104482-0008 NOW SCARBOROUGH YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE IT ONCE FOR ALL THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE TALKED DOWN IF YOU WANT TO TALK A FELLOW DOWN YOU CAN GO TO WALKER BROWN OR GREEN THEN WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF THE OCCUPATION YOU CAN COME BACK TO ME
5933-104482-0009 IT WAS THUS THAT ANNESLEY HAD BEEN WONT TO ADDRESS HIS FRIEND BUT HIS FRIEND HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO TALK DOWN THIS SPECIAL YOUNG MAN FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES AND HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF SOME WEAKNESS IN THE OTHER'S CHARACTER WHICH HE THOUGHT ENTITLED HIM TO DO SO
5933-104482-0010 BUT THE WEAKNESS WAS NOT OF THAT NATURE AND HE HAD FAILED THEN HAD COME THE RIVALRY BETWEEN MOUNTJOY AND HARRY WHICH HAD SEEMED TO AUGUSTUS TO BE THE EXTREME OF IMPUDENCE FROM OF OLD HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO REGARD HIS BROTHER MOUNTJOY AS THE FIRST OF YOUNG MEN
5933-104482-0011 AMONG COMMONERS THE FIRST IN PROSPECTS AND THE FIRST IN RANK AND TO HIM FLORENCE MOUNTJOY HAD BEEN ALLOTTED AS A BRIDE HOW HE HAD HIMSELF LEARNED FIRST TO ENVY AND THEN TO COVET THIS ALLOTTED BRIDE NEED NOT HERE BE TOLD
5933-104482-0012 BUT BY DEGREES IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT AUGUSTUS HAD DETERMINED THAT HIS SPENDTHRIFT BROTHER SHOULD FALL UNDER HIS OWN POWER AND THAT THE BRIDE SHOULD BE THE REWARD
5933-104482-0013 AND WHO WAS IN NO DEGREE SELFISH SHOULD HAVE LOVED HER ALSO MUST BE LEFT TO EXPLAIN ITSELF AS THE GIRL'S CHARACTER SHALL BE DEVELOPED BUT FLORENCE MOUNTJOY HAD NOW FOR MANY MONTHS BEEN THE CAUSE OF BITTER DISLIKE AGAINST POOR HARRY IN THE MIND OF AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH
5933-104482-0014 HE UNDERSTOOD MUCH MORE CLEARLY THAN HIS BROTHER HAD DONE WHO IT WAS THAT THE GIRL REALLY PREFERRED HE WAS EVER CONSCIOUS TOO OF HIS OWN SUPERIORITY
5933-104482-0015 FALSELY CONSCIOUS AND DID FEEL THAT IF HARRY'S CHARACTER WERE REALLY KNOWN NO GIRL WOULD IN TRUTH PREFER HIM HE COULD NOT QUITE SEE HARRY WITH FLORENCE'S EYES NOR COULD HE SEE HIMSELF WITH ANY OTHER EYES BUT HIS OWN
5933-104482-0016 FROM THAT STORY TOLD IN THE WORDS OF A DRUNKEN MAN A MAN DRUNK AND BRUISED AND BLOODY WHO CLEARLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND IN ONE MINUTE THE WORDS SPOKEN IN THE LAST
5933-104482-0017 THEN MOUNTJOY HAD DISAPPEARED HAD DISAPPEARED AS THE READER WILL HAVE UNDERSTOOD WITH HIS BROTHER'S CO OPERATION AND HARRY HAD NOT COME FORWARD
5933-104482-0018 BUT AFTERWARD WITH THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING WHY IT WAS THAT HARRY HAD BEEN SO RETICENT THEN HE HAD ALLURED HARRY ON TO A DIRECT LIE AND SOON PERCEIVED THAT HE COULD AFTERWARD USE THE SECRET FOR HIS OWN PURPOSE
5933-104482-0019 I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THAT YOUNG MAN'S ABOUT YOU KNOW HE SAID AFTERWARD TO SEPTIMUS JONES YES YES CERTAINLY SAID SEPTIMUS BUT SEPTIMUS DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS ABOUT
5933-104482-0020 BETWEEN YOU AND ME I THINK HE MEANS TO INTERFERE WITH ME AND I DO NOT MEAN TO STAND HIS INTERFERENCE I SHOULD THINK NOT HE MUST GO BACK TO BUSTON AMONG THE BUSTONIANS OR HE AND I WILL HAVE A STAND UP FIGHT OF IT
5933-104482-0021 I RATHER LIKE A STAND UP FIGHT JUST SO WHEN A FELLOW'S SO BUMPTIOUS AS THAT HE OUGHT TO BE LICKED HE HAS LIED ABOUT MOUNTJOY SAID AUGUSTUS THEN JONES WAITED TO BE TOLD HOW IT WAS THAT HARRY HAD LIED
5933-104482-0022 HE WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS SOME SECRET UNKNOWN TO HIM AND WAS ANXIOUS TO BE INFORMED WAS HARRY AWARE OF MOUNTJOY'S HIDING PLACE AND IF SO HOW HAD HE LEARNED IT WHY WAS IT THAT HARRY SHOULD BE ACQUAINTED WITH THAT WHICH WAS DARK TO ALL THE WORLD BESIDES
5933-104482-0023 HAS HE NOW AND I DON'T MEAN TO SPARE HIM I SHOULD THINK NOT THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE AT THE END OF WHICH JONES FOUND HIMSELF DRIVEN TO ASK A QUESTION HOW HAS HE LIED
5933-104482-0024 AUGUSTUS SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD FROM WHICH THE OTHER MAN GATHERED THAT HE WAS NOT NOW TO BE TOLD THE NATURE OF THE LIE IN QUESTION A FELLOW THAT LIES LIKE THAT SAID JONES IS NOT TO BE ENDURED I DO NOT MEAN TO ENDURE HIM
5933-104482-0025 YOU HAVE HEARD OF A YOUNG LADY NAMED MISS MOUNTJOY A COUSIN OF OURS MOUNTJOY'S MISS MOUNTJOY SUGGESTED JONES YES MOUNTJOY'S MISS MOUNTJOY THAT OF COURSE IS OVER
5933-104482-0026 MOUNTJOY HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF TO SUCH A PASS THAT HE IS NOT ENTITLED TO HAVE A MISS MOUNTJOY ANY LONGER IT SEEMS THE PROPER THING THAT SHE SHALL PASS WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY PROPERTY TO THE TRUE HEIR YOU MARRY HER
5933-104482-0027 WE NEED NOT TALK ABOUT THAT JUST AT PRESENT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE MADE UP MY MIND AT ANY RATE I DO NOT INTEND THAT HARRY ANNESLEY SHALL HAVE HER I SHOULD THINK NOT
5933-104482-0028 HE'S A PESTILENTIAL CUR THAT HAS GOT HIMSELF INTRODUCED INTO THE FAMILY AND THE SOONER WE GET QUIT OF HIM THE BETTER I SHOULD THINK THE YOUNG LADY WOULD HARDLY FANCY HIM WHEN SHE KNOWS THAT HE HAS LIED LIKE THE VERY DEVIL WITH THE OBJECT OF GETTING HER FORMER LOVER OUT OF THE WAY
5933-104482-0029 AND WHEN THE WORLD COMES TO UNDERSTAND THAT HARRY ANNESLEY IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE INQUIRIES KNOWS ALL ABOUT POOR MOUNTJOY WAS THE LAST TO SEE HIM IN LONDON AND HAS NEVER COME FORWARD TO SAY A WORD ABOUT HIM
5933-104482-0030 THEN I THINK THE WORLD WILL BE A LITTLE HARD UPON THE IMMACULATE HARRY ANNESLEY HIS OWN UNCLE HAS QUARRELLED WITH HIM ALREADY WHAT UNCLE THE GENTLEMAN DOWN IN HERTFORDSHIRE ON THE STRENGTH OF WHOSE ACRES MASTER HARRY IS FLAUNTING IT ABOUT IN IDLENESS
5933-104482-0031 I HAVE MY EYES OPEN AND CAN SEE AS WELL AS ANOTHER WHEN HARRY LECTURES ME ABOUT MY FATHER AND MY FATHER ABOUT ME
5933-104482-0032 I THINK HE'LL FIND THAT THE GARMENT IS NOT ALTOGETHER WATER TIGHT THEN AUGUSTUS FINDING THAT HE HAD TOLD AS MUCH AS WAS NEEDFUL TO SEPTIMUS JONES LEFT HIS FRIEND AND WENT ABOUT HIS OWN FAMILY BUSINESS
5933-104482-0033 ON THE NEXT MORNING SEPTIMUS JONES TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND ON THE DAY FOLLOWING AUGUSTUS FOLLOWED HIM
5933-104482-0034 WELL YES I SUPPOSE SO A MAN HAS GOT SO MANY THINGS TO LOOK AFTER WHICH HE CAN'T ATTEND TO DOWN HERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUT YOU UNDERSTAND IT ALL I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO STAY
5933-104482-0035 DOES IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT YOU MAY NEVER SEE ME AGAIN WHAT A QUESTION IT'S ONE THAT REQUIRES AN ANSWER AT ANY RATE IT DOES OCCUR TO ME BUT NOT AT ALL AS PROBABLE WHY NOT PROBABLE
5933-104482-0036 BECAUSE THERE'S A TELEGRAPH WIRE FROM TRETTON TO LONDON AND BECAUSE THE JOURNEY DOWN HERE IS VERY SHORT IT ALSO OCCURS TO ME TO THINK SO FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BY SIR WILLIAM BRODRICK OF COURSE ANY MAN MAY DIE SUDDENLY
5933-104482-0037 ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SURGEONS HAVE BEEN AT HIM YOU HAVE YOUR SISTER WITH YOU SIR AND SHE WILL BE OF MORE COMFORT TO YOU THAN I CAN BE YOUR CONDITION IS IN SOME RESPECTS AN ADVANTAGE TO YOU
5933-104482-0038 YOU ARE WRONG THERE THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO NOR SHOULD THEY THOUGH I WERE AS STRONG AS YOU WHAT ARE MOUNTJOY'S CREDITORS TO ME THEY HAVE NOT A SCRAP OF MY HANDWRITING IN THEIR POSSESSION
5933-104482-0039 THERE IS NOT ONE WHO CAN SAY THAT HE HAS EVEN A VERBAL PROMISE FROM ME THEY NEVER CAME TO ME WHEN THEY WANTED TO LEND HIM MONEY AT FIFTY PER CENT DID THEY EVER HEAR ME SAY THAT HE WAS MY HEIR PERHAPS NOT NOT ONE HAS EVER HEARD IT
5933-104482-0040 BUT TO YOU AND TO GREY D THE CREDITORS WHAT DO I CARE FOR THEM THOUGH THEY BE ALL RUINED NOT IN THE LEAST WHY DO YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT THE CREDITORS YOU AT ANY RATE KNOW THE TRUTH
