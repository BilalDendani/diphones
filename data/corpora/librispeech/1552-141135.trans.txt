1552-141135-0000 WHICH MAY BE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED AS A GNAWER
1552-141135-0001 IT IS EXTREMELY NUMEROUS IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE PROCURED AND NEVER I BELIEVE COMES OUT OF THE GROUND IT THROWS UP AT THE MOUTH OF ITS BURROWS HILLOCKS OF EARTH LIKE THOSE OF THE MOLE BUT SMALLER
1552-141135-0002 CONSIDERABLE TRACTS OF COUNTRY ARE SO COMPLETELY UNDERMINED BY THESE ANIMALS THAT HORSES IN PASSING OVER SINK ABOVE THEIR FETLOCKS THE TUCUTUCOS APPEAR TO A CERTAIN DEGREE TO BE GREGARIOUS
1552-141135-0003 THEY ARE NOCTURNAL IN THEIR HABITS AND THEIR PRINCIPAL FOOD IS THE ROOTS OF PLANTS WHICH ARE THE OBJECT OF THEIR EXTENSIVE AND SUPERFICIAL BURROWS THIS ANIMAL IS UNIVERSALLY KNOWN BY A VERY PECULIAR NOISE WHICH IT MAKES WHEN BENEATH THE GROUND
1552-141135-0004 A PERSON THE FIRST TIME HE HEARS IT IS MUCH SURPRISED FOR IT IS NOT EASY TO TELL WHENCE IT COMES NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO GUESS WHAT KIND OF CREATURE UTTERS IT
1552-141135-0005 THE NOISE CONSISTS IN A SHORT BUT NOT ROUGH NASAL GRUNT WHICH IS MONOTONOUSLY REPEATED ABOUT FOUR TIMES IN QUICK SUCCESSION
1552-141135-0006 WHERE THIS ANIMAL IS ABUNDANT IT MAY BE HEARD AT ALL TIMES OF THE DAY AND SOMETIMES DIRECTLY BENEATH ONE'S FEET WHEN KEPT IN A ROOM THE TUCUTUCOS MOVE BOTH SLOWLY AND CLUMSILY
1552-141135-0007 WHICH APPEARS OWING TO THE OUTWARD ACTION OF THEIR HIND LEGS AND THEY ARE QUITE INCAPABLE FROM THE SOCKET OF THE THIGH BONE NOT HAVING A CERTAIN LIGAMENT OF JUMPING EVEN THE SMALLEST VERTICAL HEIGHT THEY ARE VERY STUPID IN MAKING ANY ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
1552-141135-0008 WHEN ANGRY OR FRIGHTENED THEY UTTER THE TUCUTUCO OF THOSE I KEPT ALIVE SEVERAL EVEN THE FIRST DAY BECAME QUITE TAME NOT ATTEMPTING TO BITE OR TO RUN AWAY OTHERS WERE A LITTLE WILDER
1552-141135-0009 THE MAN WHO CAUGHT THEM ASSERTED THAT VERY MANY ARE INVARIABLY FOUND BLIND A SPECIMEN WHICH I PRESERVED IN SPIRITS WAS IN THIS STATE MISTER REID CONSIDERS IT TO BE THE EFFECT OF INFLAMMATION IN THE NICTITATING MEMBRANE
1552-141135-0010 WHEN THE ANIMAL WAS ALIVE I PLACED MY FINGER WITHIN HALF AN INCH OF ITS HEAD AND NOT THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE WAS TAKEN IT MADE ITS WAY HOWEVER ABOUT THE ROOM NEARLY AS WELL AS THE OTHERS CONSIDERING THE STRICTLY SUBTERRANEAN HABITS OF THE TUCUTUCO
1552-141135-0011 THE BLINDNESS THOUGH SO COMMON CANNOT BE A VERY SERIOUS EVIL YET IT APPEARS STRANGE THAT ANY ANIMAL SHOULD POSSESS AN ORGAN FREQUENTLY SUBJECT TO BE INJURED LAMARCK WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED WITH THIS FACT HAD HE KNOWN IT
1552-141135-0012 ON THE GRADUALLY ACQUIRED
1552-141135-0013 AND OF THE PROTEUS A REPTILE LIVING IN DARK CAVERNS FILLED WITH WATER IN BOTH OF WHICH ANIMALS THE EYE IS IN AN ALMOST RUDIMENTARY STATE AND IS COVERED BY A TENDINOUS MEMBRANE AND SKIN
1552-141135-0014 IN THE COMMON MOLE THE EYE IS EXTRAORDINARILY SMALL BUT PERFECT THOUGH MANY ANATOMISTS DOUBT WHETHER IT IS CONNECTED WITH THE TRUE OPTIC NERVE ITS VISION MUST CERTAINLY BE IMPERFECT THOUGH PROBABLY USEFUL TO THE ANIMAL WHEN IT LEAVES ITS BURROW
1552-141135-0015 IN THE TUCUTUCO WHICH I BELIEVE NEVER COMES TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND THE EYE IS RATHER LARGER BUT OFTEN RENDERED BLIND AND USELESS THOUGH WITHOUT APPARENTLY CAUSING ANY INCONVENIENCE TO THE ANIMAL NO DOUBT LAMARCK WOULD HAVE SAID
1552-141135-0016 THAT THE TUCUTUCO IS NOW PASSING INTO THE STATE OF THE ASPHALAX AND PROTEUS BIRDS OF MANY KINDS ARE EXTREMELY ABUNDANT ON THE UNDULATING GRASSY PLAINS AROUND MALDONADO
1552-141135-0017 ONE OF THESE MOLOTHRUS NIGER IS REMARKABLE FROM ITS HABITS SEVERAL MAY OFTEN BE SEEN STANDING TOGETHER ON THE BACK OF A COW OR HORSE AND WHILE PERCHED ON A HEDGE PLUMING THEMSELVES IN THE SUN THEY SOMETIMES ATTEMPT TO SING OR RATHER TO HISS
1552-141135-0018 THE NOISE BEING VERY PECULIAR RESEMBLING THAT OF BUBBLES OF AIR PASSING RAPIDLY FROM A SMALL ORIFICE UNDER WATER SO AS TO PRODUCE AN ACUTE SOUND ACCORDING TO AZARA THIS BIRD LIKE THE CUCKOO DEPOSITS ITS EGGS IN OTHER BIRDS NESTS
1552-141135-0019 I WAS SEVERAL TIMES TOLD BY THE COUNTRY PEOPLE THAT THERE CERTAINLY IS SOME BIRD HAVING THIS HABIT AND MY ASSISTANT IN COLLECTING WHO IS A VERY ACCURATE PERSON FOUND A NEST OF THE SPARROW OF THIS COUNTRY ZONOTRICHIA MATUTINA
1552-141135-0020 WITH ONE EGG IN IT LARGER THAN THE OTHERS
1552-141135-0021 IN NORTH AMERICA THERE IS ANOTHER SPECIES OF MOLOTHRUS
1552-141135-0022 EVEN IN SUCH TRIFLING PECULIARITIES AS STANDING ON THE BACKS OF CATTLE IT DIFFERS ONLY IN BEING A LITTLE SMALLER AND IN ITS PLUMAGE AND EGGS BEING OF A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SHADE OF COLOUR THIS CLOSE AGREEMENT IN STRUCTURE AND HABITS
1552-141135-0023 WHOSE ANIMAL HEAT BRINGS THEIR YOUNG INTO LIFE WHOSE FOOD THEY LIVE UPON AND WHOSE DEATH WOULD CAUSE THEIRS DURING THE PERIOD OF INFANCY IT IS REMARKABLE THAT SOME OF THE SPECIES BUT NOT ALL BOTH OF THE CUCKOO AND MOLOTHRUS
1552-141135-0024 SHOULD AGREE IN THIS ONE STRANGE HABIT OF THEIR PARASITICAL PROPAGATION WHILST OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER HABIT THE MOLOTHRUS LIKE OUR STARLING IS EMINENTLY SOCIABLE AND LIVES ON THE OPEN PLAINS WITHOUT ART OR DISGUISE THE CUCKOO AS EVERY ONE KNOWS
1552-141135-0025 IS A SINGULARLY SHY BIRD IT FREQUENTS THE MOST RETIRED THICKETS AND FEEDS ON FRUIT AND CATERPILLARS IN STRUCTURE ALSO THESE TWO GENERA ARE WIDELY REMOVED FROM EACH OTHER
1552-141135-0026 HE FINDS THAT THE FEMALE CUCKOO WHICH ACCORDING TO MOST OBSERVERS LAYS AT LEAST FROM FOUR TO SIX EGGS MUST PAIR WITH THE MALE EACH TIME AFTER LAYING ONLY ONE OR TWO EGGS NOW IF THE CUCKOO WAS OBLIGED TO SIT ON HER OWN EGGS SHE WOULD EITHER HAVE TO SIT ON ALL TOGETHER
1552-141135-0027 AND THEREFORE LEAVE THOSE FIRST LAID SO LONG THAT THEY PROBABLY WOULD BECOME ADDLED OR SHE WOULD HAVE TO HATCH SEPARATELY EACH EGG OR TWO EGGS AS SOON AS LAID
1552-141135-0028 SHE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE TIME ENOUGH FOR THE SUCCESSIVE HATCHINGS HENCE WE CAN PERCEIVE IN THE FACT OF THE CUCKOO PAIRING SEVERAL TIMES AND LAYING HER EGGS AT INTERVALS THE CAUSE OF HER DEPOSITING HER EGGS IN OTHER BIRDS NESTS
1552-141135-0029 FROM HAVING BEEN INDEPENDENTLY LED AS WE SHALL HEREAFTER SEE TO AN ANALOGOUS CONCLUSION WITH REGARD TO THE SOUTH AMERICAN OSTRICH THE FEMALES OF WHICH ARE PARASITICAL IF I MAY SO EXPRESS IT ON EACH OTHER EACH FEMALE LAYING SEVERAL EGGS IN THE NESTS OF SEVERAL OTHER FEMALES
1552-141135-0030 AND THE MALE OSTRICH UNDERTAKING ALL THE CARES OF INCUBATION LIKE THE STRANGE FOSTER PARENTS WITH THE CUCKOO I WILL MENTION ONLY TWO OTHER BIRDS WHICH ARE VERY COMMON AND RENDER THEMSELVES PROMINENT FROM THEIR HABITS
1552-141135-0031 THE SAUROPHAGUS SULPHURATUS IS TYPICAL OF THE GREAT AMERICAN TRIBE OF TYRANT FLYCATCHERS IN ITS STRUCTURE IT CLOSELY APPROACHES THE TRUE SHRIKES BUT IN ITS HABITS MAY BE COMPARED TO MANY BIRDS
1552-141135-0032 HOVERING OVER ONE SPOT LIKE A HAWK AND THEN PROCEEDING ON TO ANOTHER WHEN SEEN THUS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR IT MIGHT VERY READILY AT A SHORT DISTANCE BE MISTAKEN FOR ONE OF THE RAPACIOUS ORDER
1552-141135-0033 AT OTHER TIMES THE SAUROPHAGUS HAUNTS THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WATER AND THERE LIKE A KINGFISHER REMAINING STATIONARY IT CATCHES ANY SMALL FISH WHICH MAY COME NEAR THE MARGIN THESE BIRDS ARE NOT UNFREQUENTLY KEPT EITHER IN CAGES OR IN COURTYARDS
1552-141135-0034 WITH THEIR WINGS CUT THEY SOON BECOME TAME AND ARE VERY AMUSING FROM THEIR CUNNING ODD MANNERS WHICH WERE DESCRIBED TO ME AS BEING SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE COMMON MAGPIE THEIR FLIGHT IS UNDULATORY FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAD AND BILL APPEARS TOO GREAT FOR THE BODY
1552-141135-0035 IN THE EVENING THE SAUROPHAGUS TAKES ITS STAND ON A BUSH OFTEN BY THE ROADSIDE
1552-141135-0036 WHICH SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES ARTICULATE WORDS THE SPANIARDS SAY IT IS LIKE THE WORDS BIEN TE VEO I SEE YOU WELL AND ACCORDINGLY HAVE GIVEN IT THIS NAME
1552-141135-0037 A MOCKING BIRD MIMUS ORPHEUS CALLED BY THE INHABITANTS CALANDRIA IS REMARKABLE FROM POSSESSING A SONG FAR SUPERIOR TO THAT OF ANY OTHER BIRD IN THE COUNTRY
1552-141135-0038 INDEED IT IS NEARLY THE ONLY BIRD IN SOUTH AMERICA WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED TO TAKE ITS STAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF SINGING THE SONG MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF THE SEDGE WARBLER BUT IS MORE POWERFUL SOME HARSH NOTES AND SOME VERY HIGH ONES
1552-141135-0039 BEING MINGLED WITH A PLEASANT WARBLING IT IS HEARD ONLY DURING THE SPRING AT OTHER TIMES ITS CRY IS HARSH AND FAR FROM HARMONIOUS NEAR MALDONADO THESE BIRDS WERE TAME AND BOLD THEY CONSTANTLY ATTENDED THE COUNTRY HOUSES IN NUMBERS
1552-141135-0040 TO PICK THE MEAT WHICH WAS HUNG UP ON THE POSTS OR WALLS IF ANY OTHER SMALL BIRD JOINED THE FEAST THE CALANDRIA SOON CHASED IT AWAY ON THE WIDE UNINHABITED PLAINS OF PATAGONIA ANOTHER CLOSELY ALLIED SPECIES O PATAGONICA
1552-141135-0041 OF D'ORBIGNY WHICH FREQUENTS THE VALLEYS CLOTHED WITH SPINY BUSHES IS A WILDER BIRD AND HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TONE OF VOICE IT APPEARS TO ME A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE AS SHOWING THE FINE SHADES OF DIFFERENCE IN HABITS
1552-141135-0042 WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS SECOND SPECIES I THOUGHT IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE MALDONADO KIND HAVING AFTERWARDS PROCURED A SPECIMEN AND COMPARING THE TWO WITHOUT PARTICULAR CARE THEY APPEARED SO VERY SIMILAR THAT I CHANGED MY OPINION
1552-141135-0043 A CONCLUSION IN CONFORMITY WITH THE TRIFLING DIFFERENCE OF HABIT
1552-141135-0044 THE NUMBER TAMENESS AND DISGUSTING HABITS OF THE CARRION FEEDING HAWKS OF SOUTH AMERICA MAKE THEM PRE EMINENTLY STRIKING TO ANY ONE ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO THE BIRDS OF NORTHERN EUROPE
