6233-61741-0000 THE BREAKFAST BELL OF CASA DEL CORVO HAD SOUNDED ITS SECOND AND LAST SUMMONS PRECEDED BY A STILL EARLIER SIGNAL FROM A HORN INTENDED TO CALL IN THE STRAGGLERS FROM REMOTE PARTS OF THE PLANTATION
6233-61741-0001 THE FIELD HANDS LABOURING NEAR HAD COLLECTED AROUND THE QUARTER AND IN GROUPS SQUATTED UPON THE GRASS OR SEATED UPON STRAY LOGS WERE DISCUSSING THEIR DIET BY NO MEANS SPARE OF HOG AND HOMINY CORN BREAD AND CORN COFFEE
6233-61741-0002 THE PLANTER'S FAMILY ASSEMBLED IN THE SALA WERE ABOUT TO BEGIN BREAKFAST WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF ITS MEMBERS WAS MISSING HENRY WAS THE ABSENT ONE AT FIRST THERE WAS BUT LITTLE NOTICE TAKEN OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE
6233-61741-0003 ONLY THE CONJECTURE THAT HE WOULD SHORTLY MAKE HIS APPEARANCE AS SEVERAL MINUTES PASSED WITHOUT HIS COMING IN THE PLANTER QUIETLY OBSERVED THAT IT WAS RATHER STRANGE OF HENRY TO BE BEHIND TIME AND WONDER WHERE HE COULD BE
6233-61741-0004 THE BREAKFAST OF THE SOUTH WESTERN AMERICAN IS USUALLY A WELL APPOINTED MEAL IT IS EATEN AT A FIXED HOUR AND TABLE D'HOTE FASHION ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MEETING AT THE TABLE THIS HABIT IS EXACTED BY A SORT OF NECESSITY
6233-61741-0005 IS THAT IN WHICH THE COOK IS BROILING HER SKIN IN THE KITCHEN AS THE LAGGARD OR LATE RISER MAY HAVE TO PUT UP WITH COLD BISCUIT AND NO WAFFLES OR BUCKWHEAT CAKES THERE ARE FEW SUCH ON A SOUTHERN PLANTATION
6233-61741-0006 CONSIDERING THIS CUSTOM IT WAS SOMEWHAT STRANGE THAT HENRY POINDEXTER HAD NOT YET PUT IN AN APPEARANCE WHERE CAN THE BOY BE ASKED HIS FATHER FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN THAT TONE OF MILD CONJECTURE THAT SCARCE CALLS FOR REPLY
6233-61741-0007 AS IN THE TONE OF HER VOICE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY ONE CLOSELY SCRUTINISING HER FEATURES IT COULD SCARCE BE CAUSED BY THE ABSENCE OF HER BROTHER FROM THE BREAKFAST TABLE THE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS TOO TRIFLING TO CALL UP AN EMOTION AND CLEARLY AT THAT MOMENT
6233-61741-0008 WHAT WAS IT NO ONE PUT THE INQUIRY HER FATHER DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING ODD IN HER LOOK MUCH LESS CALHOUN WHO WAS HIMSELF MARKEDLY LABOURING TO CONCEAL SOME DISAGREEABLE THOUGHT UNDER THE GUISE OF AN ASSUMED NAIVETE
6233-61741-0009 EVER SINCE ENTERING THE ROOM HE HAD MAINTAINED A STUDIED SILENCE KEEPING HIS EYES AVERTED INSTEAD OF ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL CUSTOM CONSTANTLY STRAYING TOWARDS HIS COUSIN HE SATE NERVOUSLY IN HIS CHAIR AND ONCE OR TWICE
6233-61741-0010 MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN TO START AS A SERVANT ENTERED THE ROOM BEYOND DOUBT HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SOME EXTRAORDINARY AGITATION VERY STRANGE HENRY NOT BEING HERE TO HIS BREAKFAST
6233-61741-0011 SURELY HE IS NOT ABED TILL THIS HOUR NO NO HE NEVER LIES SO LATE
6233-61741-0012 THE SABLE COACHEE ACTING AS TABLE WAITER WAS IN THE SALA HOVERING AROUND THE CHAIRS GO TO HENRY'S SLEEPING ROOM
6233-61741-0013 ARE YOU SURE ASKED THE PLANTER SERIOUSLY STIRRED BY THE INTELLIGENCE SATIN SHOO MASS WOODLEY
6233-61741-0014 DARR MASSR HENRY AM TOO THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE IN ALL THIS PURSUED THE PLANTER AS PLUTO SHUFFLED OUT OF THE SALA HENRY FROM HOME AND AT NIGHT TOO WHERE CAN HE HAVE GONE I CAN'T THINK OF ANY ONE HE WOULD BE VISITING AT SUCH UNSEASONABLE HOURS
6233-61741-0015 HE MUST HAVE BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT OR VERY EARLY ACCORDING TO THE NIGGER'S ACCOUNT AT THE PORT I SUPPOSE WITH THOSE YOUNG FELLOWS NOT AT THE TAVERN I HOPE OH NO HE WOULDN'T GO THERE INTERPOSED CALHOUN WHO APPEARED AS MUCH MYSTIFIED BY THE ABSENCE OF HENRY
6233-61741-0016 AS WAS POINDEXTER HIMSELF HE REFRAINED HOWEVER FROM SUGGESTING ANY EXPLANATION OR SAYING AUGHT OF THE SCENES TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN WITNESS ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT IT IS TO BE HOPED HE KNOWS NOTHING OF IT REFLECTED THE YOUNG CREOLE
6233-61741-0017 IF NOT IT MAY STILL REMAIN A SECRET BETWEEN BROTHER AND MYSELF I THINK I CAN MANAGE HENRY BUT WHY IS HE STILL ABSENT I'VE SATE UP ALL NIGHT WAITING FOR HIM HE MUST HAVE OVERTAKEN MAURICE AND THEY HAVE FRATERNISED I HOPE SO
6233-61741-0018 EVEN THOUGH THE TAVERN MAY HAVE BEEN THE SCENE OF THEIR RECONCILIATION HENRY IS NOT MUCH GIVEN TO DISSIPATION BUT AFTER SUCH A BURST OF PASSION FOLLOWED BY HIS SUDDEN REPENTANCE HE MAY HAVE STRAYED FROM HIS USUAL HABITS WHO COULD BLAME HIM IF HE HAS THERE CAN BE LITTLE HARM IN IT
6233-61741-0019 SINCE HE HAS GONE ASTRAY IN GOOD COMPANY HOW FAR THE STRING OF REFLECTIONS MIGHT HAVE EXTENDED IT IS NOT EASY TO SAY SINCE IT DID NOT REACH ITS NATURAL ENDING IT WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE REAPPEARANCE OF PLUTO WHOSE IMPORTANT AIR AS HE RE ENTERED THE ROOM
6233-61741-0020 PROCLAIMED HIM THE BEARER OF EVENTFUL TIDINGS WELL CRIED HIS MASTER WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO SPEAK IS HE THERE NO MASS WOODLEY REPLIED THE BLACK IN A VOICE THAT BETRAYED A LARGE MEASURE OF EMOTION
6233-61741-0021 DAT HIM HOSS AM DAR HIS HORSE THERE NOT IN HIS SLEEPING ROOM I SUPPOSE NO MASSA

6233-61741-0025 I TELL YOU NO MO COME TO DE GATE OB DO HASHASHANTY AND SEE FO YOUSEFF BY THIS TIME THE IMPRESSION CONVEYED BY PLUTO'S SPEECH MUCH MORE BY HIS MANNER NOTWITHSTANDING ITS AMBIGUITY HAD BECOME SUFFICIENTLY ALARMING
6233-61741-0026 CALCULATED TO INSPIRE ALL THREE WITH THE MOST TERRIBLE APPREHENSIONS A NEGRO MAN ONE OF THE FIELD SLAVES OF THE PLANTATION STOOD HOLDING A HORSE THAT WAS SADDLED AND BRIDLED THE ANIMAL WET WITH THE DEWS OF THE NIGHT
6233-61741-0027 AND HAVING BEEN EVIDENTLY UNCARED FOR IN ANY STABLE WAS SNORTING AND STAMPING THE GROUND AS IF BUT LATELY ESCAPED FROM SOME SCENE OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO TAKE PART
6233-61741-0028 DARKER THAN HIS OWN COAT OF BAY BROWN THE SPOTS SCATTERED OVER HIS SHOULDERS THE STREAKS THAT RAN PARALLEL WITH THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION OF HIS LIMBS THE BLOTCHES SHOWING CONSPICUOUSLY ON THE SADDLE FLAPS
6233-61741-0029 OF COAGULATED BLOOD BLOOD HAD CAUSED THEM SPOTS STREAKS AND BLOTCHES WHENCE CAME THAT HORSE FROM THE PRAIRIES THE NEGRO HAD CAUGHT HIM ON THE OUTSIDE PLAIN AS WITH THE BRIDLE TRAILING AMONG HIS FEET
6233-61741-0030 HE WAS INSTINCTIVELY STRAYING TOWARDS THE HACIENDA TO WHOM DID HE BELONG THE QUESTION WAS NOT ASKED ALL PRESENT KNEW HIM TO BE THE HORSE OF HENRY POINDEXTER
6233-61741-0031 WHO STOOD TO THEM IN THE TRIPLE RELATIONSHIP OF SON BROTHER AND COUSIN THE DARK RED SPOTS ON WHICH THEY WERE DISTRACTEDLY GAZING HAD SPURTED FROM THE VEINS OF HENRY POINDEXTER
