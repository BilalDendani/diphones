5448-19209-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE THE GRANDFATHER BASQUE AND THE PORTER HAD CARRIED MARIUS INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
5448-19209-0001 MOTIONLESS ON THE SOFA UPON WHICH HE HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS ARRIVAL THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR HAD HASTENED THITHER
5448-19209-0002 IN AFFRIGHT WRINGING HER HANDS AND INCAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING BUT SAYING HEAVENS IS IT POSSIBLE AT TIMES SHE ADDED
5448-19209-0003 AND TOOK FORM IN THE EXCLAMATION
5448-19209-0004 SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS I TOLD YOU SO WHICH IS CUSTOMARY ON THIS SORT OF OCCASION AT THE PHYSICIAN'S ORDERS A CAMP BED HAD BEEN PREPARED BESIDE THE SOFA THE DOCTOR EXAMINED MARIUS
5448-19209-0005 AND AFTER HAVING FOUND THAT HIS PULSE WAS STILL BEATING THAT THE WOUNDED MAN HAD NO VERY DEEP WOUND ON HIS BREAST AND THAT THE BLOOD ON THE CORNERS OF HIS LIPS PROCEEDED FROM HIS NOSTRILS HE HAD HIM PLACED FLAT ON THE BED WITHOUT A PILLOW
5448-19209-0006 WITH HIS HEAD ON THE SAME LEVEL AS HIS BODY AND EVEN A TRIFLE LOWER AND WITH HIS BUST BARE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE RESPIRATION
5448-19209-0007 ON PERCEIVING THAT THEY WERE UNDRESSING MARIUS WITHDREW SHE SET HERSELF TO TELLING HER BEADS IN HER OWN CHAMBER THE TRUNK HAD NOT SUFFERED ANY INTERNAL INJURY A BULLET DEADENED BY THE POCKET BOOK
5448-19209-0008 HAD TURNED ASIDE AND MADE THE TOUR OF HIS RIBS WITH A HIDEOUS LACERATION WHICH WAS OF NO GREAT DEPTH AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT DANGEROUS THE LONG UNDERGROUND JOURNEY HAD COMPLETED THE DISLOCATION OF THE BROKEN COLLAR BONE
5448-19209-0009 AND THE DISORDER THERE WAS SERIOUS THE ARMS HAD BEEN SLASHED WITH SABRE CUTS NOT A SINGLE SCAR DISFIGURED HIS FACE BUT HIS HEAD WAS FAIRLY COVERED WITH CUTS WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULT OF THESE WOUNDS ON THE HEAD
5448-19209-0010 WOULD THEY STOP SHORT AT THE HAIRY CUTICLE OR WOULD THEY ATTACK THE BRAIN AS YET THIS COULD NOT BE DECIDED A GRAVE SYMPTOM WAS THAT THEY HAD CAUSED A SWOON AND THAT PEOPLE DO NOT ALWAYS RECOVER FROM SUCH SWOONS
5448-19209-0011 MOREOVER THE WOUNDED MAN HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED BY HEMORRHAGE FROM THE WAIST DOWN THE BARRICADE HAD PROTECTED THE LOWER PART OF THE BODY FROM INJURY BASQUE AND NICOLETTE
5448-19209-0012 NICOLETTE SEWED THEM BASQUE ROLLED THEM AS LINT WAS LACKING THE DOCTOR FOR THE TIME BEING ARRESTED THE BLEEDING WITH LAYERS OF WADDING BESIDE THE BED THREE CANDLES BURNED ON A TABLE WHERE THE CASE OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS LAY SPREAD OUT
5448-19209-0013 A FULL PAIL WAS REDDENED IN AN INSTANT THE PORTER CANDLE IN HAND LIGHTED THEM THE DOCTOR SEEMED TO BE PONDERING SADLY FROM TIME TO TIME HE MADE A NEGATIVE SIGN WITH HIS HEAD
5448-19209-0014 AS THOUGH REPLYING TO SOME QUESTION WHICH HE HAD INWARDLY ADDRESSED TO HIMSELF A BAD SIGN FOR THE SICK MAN ARE THESE MYSTERIOUS DIALOGUES OF THE DOCTOR WITH HIMSELF
5448-19209-0015 AND LIGHTLY TOUCHING HIS STILL CLOSED EYES WITH HIS FINGER A DOOR OPENED AT THE END OF THE DRAWING ROOM AND A LONG PALLID FIGURE MADE ITS APPEARANCE THIS WAS THE GRANDFATHER THE REVOLT HAD FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS DEEPLY AGITATED
5448-19209-0016 AND HE HAD BEEN IN A FEVER ALL DAY LONG IN THE EVENING HE HAD GONE TO BED VERY EARLY RECOMMENDING THAT EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE SHOULD BE WELL BARRED AND HE HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE THROUGH SHEER FATIGUE OLD MEN SLEEP LIGHTLY
5448-19209-0017 THE NOISE HAD AWAKENED HIM SURPRISED AT THE RIFT OF LIGHT WHICH HE SAW UNDER HIS DOOR HE HAD RISEN FROM HIS BED AND HAD GROPED HIS WAY THITHER HE STOOD ASTONISHED ON THE THRESHOLD ONE HAND ON THE HANDLE OF THE HALF OPEN DOOR
5448-19209-0018 WITH HIS HEAD BENT A LITTLE FORWARD AND QUIVERING HIS BODY WRAPPED IN A WHITE DRESSING GOWN WHICH WAS STRAIGHT AND AS DESTITUTE OF FOLDS AS A WINDING SHEET AND HE HAD THE AIR OF A PHANTOM WHO IS GAZING INTO A TOMB HE SAW THE BED
5448-19209-0019 AND ON THE MATTRESS THAT YOUNG MAN BLEEDING WHITE WITH A WAXEN WHITENESS WITH CLOSED EYES AND GAPING MOUTH AND PALLID LIPS STRIPPED TO THE WAIST SLASHED ALL OVER WITH CRIMSON WOUNDS MOTIONLESS AND BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED UP
5448-19209-0020 THE GRANDFATHER TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT AS POWERFULLY AS OSSIFIED LIMBS CAN TREMBLE HIS EYES WHOSE CORNEAE WERE YELLOW ON ACCOUNT OF HIS GREAT AGE WERE VEILED IN A SORT OF VITREOUS GLITTER
5448-19209-0021 HIS WHOLE FACE ASSUMED IN AN INSTANT THE EARTHY ANGLES OF A SKULL HIS ARMS FELL PENDENT AS THOUGH A SPRING HAD BROKEN AND HIS AMAZEMENT WAS BETRAYED BY THE OUTSPREADING OF THE FINGERS OF HIS TWO AGED HANDS WHICH QUIVERED ALL OVER
5448-19209-0022 HIS KNEES FORMED AN ANGLE IN FRONT ALLOWING THROUGH THE OPENING IN HIS DRESSING GOWN A VIEW OF HIS POOR BARE LEGS ALL BRISTLING WITH WHITE HAIRS AND HE MURMURED
