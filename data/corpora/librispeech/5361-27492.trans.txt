5361-27492-0027 AS TO FIGHTING YOU MY DEAR FELLOW I AM PERFECTLY AT YOUR SERVICE AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS WHENEVER I RESIGN MY APPOINTMENT AS INSPECTOR OF POLICE FOR THE COLONY OF NEW SOUTH WALES
5361-27492-0028 THE CIVIL SERVICE REGULATIONS DO NOT PERMIT OF DUELLING AT PRESENT AND I FOUND IT SO DEUCED HARD TO WORK UP TO THE BILLET THAT I AM NOT GOING TO IMPERIL MY CONTINUANCE THEREIN AFTER ALL I HAD NO INTENTION OF HURTING YOUR FEELINGS AND APOLOGISE IF I DID AS FOR THAT RASCAL STARLIGHT HE WOULD DECEIVE THE VERY DEVIL HIMSELF
5361-27492-0029 AND SO SIR FERDINAND RODE OFF HOW DID YOU COME BY JONATHAN'S WE CALLED NOWHERE WARRIGAL AS USUAL MADE A SHORT CUT OF HIS OWN ACROSS THE BUSH SCRUBS GULLIES MOUNTAINS ALL MANNER OF DESERT PATHS
5361-27492-0030 WE DROPPED IN TO BREAKFAST HERE AT DAYLIGHT AND I FELT SLEEPY ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER SNOOZE WE'RE ALL HERE AGAIN IT SEEMS I SAID SOUR ENOUGH
5361-27492-0031 THEY MUST TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES D N THEM HA VERY TRUE SAYS STARLIGHT IN HIS DREAMY KIND OF WAY MOST TRUE RICHARD SOCIETY SHOULD MAKE A TRUCE OCCASIONALLY OR PROCLAIM AN AMNESTY WITH OFFENDERS OF OUR STAMP IT WOULD PAY BETTER THAN DRIVING US TO DESPERATION
5361-27492-0032 HOW IS JIM HE'S WORSE OFF THAN EITHER OF US POOR FELLOW JIM'S VERY BAD HE CAN'T GET OVER BEING AWAY FROM JEANIE I NEVER SAW HIM SO DOWN IN THE MOUTH THIS YEARS POOR OLD JIM HE'S A DEAL TOO GOOD FOR THE PLACE SAD MISTAKE THIS GETTING MARRIED
5361-27492-0033 BUT SOFT AS THEY SAY IN THE PLAY WHERE AM I I THOUGHT I WAS A VIRTUOUS MINER AGAIN HERE WE ARE AT THIS DEVIL DISCOVERED DEMON HAUNTED OLD HOLLOW AGAIN
5361-27492-0034 WE DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR A FEW DAYS YOU MAY BE SURE
5361-27492-0035 AND WE HADN'T MADE UP OUR MIND WHAT OUR LINE WAS TO BE ONE THING WAS CERTAIN THERE WOULD BE MORE ROW MADE ABOUT US THAN EVER
5361-27492-0036 LIVING AT THE DIGGINGS UNDER THE NOSE OF THE POLICE WITHOUT THEIR HAVING THE LEAST SUSPICION WHO WE WERE WAS BAD ENOUGH BUT THE RESCUE OF JIM AND THE SHOOTING OF A POLICEMAN IN CHARGE OF HIM WAS MORE SERIOUS
5361-27492-0037 THERE WOULD BE THE DEVIL TO PAY IF THEY COULDN'T FIND A TRACK OF US NO DOUBT MONEY WOULD BE SPENT LIKE WATER IN BRIBING ANY ONE WHO MIGHT GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT US EVERY ONE WOULD BE TRIED THAT WE HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO BE FRIENDLY WITH
5361-27492-0038 WE HAD LONG TALKS AND BARNEYS OVER THE WHOLE THING SOMETIMES BY OURSELVES WITH STARLIGHT SOMETIMES WITH FATHER A LONG TIME IT WAS BEFORE WE SETTLED UPON ANY REGULAR PUT UP BIT OF WORK TO DO SOONER OR LATER WE BEGAN TO SEE THE SECRET OF THE HOLLOW WOULD BE FOUND OUT
5361-27492-0039 THERE WAS NO GREAT CHANCE IN THE OLD TIMES WITH ONLY A FEW SHEPHERDS AND STOCK RIDERS WANDERING THROUGH THE BUSH ONCE IN A WAY STRAGGLING OVER THE COUNTRY BUT NOW THE WHOLE COLONY SWARMED WITH MINERS WHO WERE ALWAYS PROSPECTING AS THEY CALLED IT THAT IS LOOKING OUT FOR FRESH PATCHES OF GOLD
5361-27492-0040 NOW SMALL PARTIES OF THESE MEN BOLD HARDY EXPERIENCED CHAPS WOULD TAKE A PICK AND SHOVEL A BUCKET AND A TIN DISH WITH A FEW WEEKS RATIONS AND SCOUR THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE
5361-27492-0041 IF THEY FOUND THE COLOUR OF GOLD THE LEAST TRACE OF IT IN A DISH OF WASH DIRT THEY WOULD AT ONCE SETTLE DOWN THEMSELVES IF IT WENT RICH THE NEWS WOULD SOON SPREAD AND A THOUSAND MEN MIGHT BE GATHERED IN ONE SPOT THE BANK OF A SMALL CREEK THE SIDE OF A STEEP RANGE WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
5361-27492-0042 WITH TEN THOUSAND MORE SURE TO FOLLOW WITHIN A MONTH THAT MIGHT HAPPEN AT ANY TIME ON ONE OF THE SPURS OF NULLA MOUNTAIN AND THE FINDING OUT OF THE TRACK DOWN TO THE HOLLOW BY SOME ONE OF THE DOZENS OF RAMBLING SHOOTING FISHING DIGGERS WOULD BE AS CERTAIN TO HAPPEN AS THE SUN TO RISE
5361-27492-0043 WELL THE COUNTRY HAD CHANGED AND WE WERE BOUND TO CHANGE WITH IT WE COULDN'T STOP BOXED UP IN THE HOLLOW DAY AFTER DAY AND MONTH AFTER MONTH SHOOTING AND HORSE BREAKING DOING NOTHING AND EARNING NOTHING IF WE WENT OUTSIDE THERE WERE TEN TIMES MORE MEN LOOKING OUT FOR US THAN EVER
5361-27492-0044 TEN TIMES MORE CHANCE OF OUR BEING TRACKED OR RUN DOWN THAN EVER THAT WE KNEW FROM THE NEWSPAPERS HOW DID WE SEE THEM OH THE OLD WAY WE SENT OUT OUR SCOUT WARRIGAL
5361-27492-0045 FROM A SURE HAND AS STARLIGHT SAID THE OLD PEOPLE IN THE ENGLISH WARS USED TO SAY THE PAPERS WERE SOMETHING TO SEE FIRST HE BROUGHT US IN A HANDBILL THAT WAS POSTED IN BARGO LIKE THIS FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD
5361-27492-0046 BUT WHO CAN BE IDENTIFIED CHIEFLY BY THE APPELLATION OF STARLIGHT PLEASING WAY OF DRAWING ATTENTION TO A GENTLEMAN'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE SAYS STARLIGHT SMILING FIRST AND LOOKING RATHER GRIM AFTERWARDS NEVER MIND BOYS THEY'LL INCREASE THAT REWARD YET BY JOVE IT WILL HAVE TO BE A THOUSAND A PIECE IF THEY DON'T LOOK A LITTLE SHARPER
5361-27492-0047 WE LAUGHED AND DAD GROWLED OUT DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THE PLUCK ANY ON YE TO TACKLE A BIG TOUCH AGAIN I EXPECT THEY'LL SEND A SUMMONS FOR US NEXT AND GET OLD BILL BARKIS THE BAILIFF AT BARGO TO SERVE IT COME COME GOVERNOR SAYS STARLIGHT NONE OF THAT
5361-27492-0048 TURON STAR WHAT A GODSEND TO IT BUSH RANGERS STARLIGHT AND THE MARSTONS AGAIN
5361-27492-0049 THAT THESE CELEBRATED DESPERADOES FOR WHOSE APPREHENSION SUCH LARGE SUMS HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR WHOM THE POLICE IN ALL THE COLONIES HAVE MADE SUCH UNREMITTING SEARCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN OUR MIDST YET SUCH IS THE CASE ON THIS VERY MORNING FROM INFORMATION RECEIVED
5361-27492-0050 OUR RESPECTED AND EFFICIENT INSPECTOR OF POLICE SIR FERDINAND MORRINGER PROCEEDED SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT TO THE CAMP OF MESSRS CLIFFORD AND HASTINGS HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN ARRESTING THE FAMOUS STARLIGHT WHO UNDER THE COGNOMEN OF THE HONOURABLE FRANK HAUGHTON
5361-27492-0051 HAS BEEN FOR MONTHS A PARTNER IN THIS CLAIM
5361-27492-0052 IT BEING RUMOURED THAT BOTH MISTER CLIFFORD AND MISTER HASTINGS WERE ENTITLED TO THAT PREFIX IF NOT TO A MORE EXALTED ONE WITH CHARACTERISTIC CELERITY HOWEVER
5361-27492-0053 THE FAMOUS OUTLAW HAD SHORTLY BEFORE QUITTED THE PLACE HAVING RECEIVED WARNING AND BEEN PROVIDED WITH A FAST HORSE BY HIS SINGULAR RETAINER WARRIGAL A HALF CASTE NATIVE OF THE COLONY WHO IS SAID TO BE DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM AND WHO HAS BEEN SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE TURON
5361-27492-0054 OF THE MARSTON BROTHERS THE ELDER ONE RICHARD WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY APPRISED BUT JAMES MARSTON WAS ARRESTED IN HIS COTTAGE IN SPECIMEN GULLY HAVING BEEN LATELY MARRIED HE WAS APPARENTLY UNWILLING TO LEAVE HIS HOME AND LINGERED TOO LONG FOR PRUDENCE
5361-27492-0055 WHILE REJOICING AS MUST ALL GOOD CITIZENS AT THE DISCOVERY OF EVIL DOERS AND THE CAPTURE OF ONE MEMBER OF A BAND OF NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS WE MUST STATE IN FAIRNESS AND CANDOUR THAT THEIR CONDUCT HAS BEEN WHILE ON THE FIELD AS MINERS FREE FROM REPROACH IN EVERY WAY
5361-27492-0056 FOR JAMES MARSTON WHO WAS MARRIED BUT A SHORT WHILE SINCE TO A MELBOURNE YOUNG LADY OF HIGH PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS AND THE MOST WINNING AMIABILITY GREAT SYMPATHY HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY ALL CLASSES SO MUCH FOR THE STAR
5361-27492-0057 I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF THEY'D MAKE YOU A BEAK IF YOU'D STAYED THERE LONG ENOUGH I'M AFRAID DICK'S DROPPING THE POLICEMAN WON'T ADD TO OUR POPULARITY THOUGH HE'S ALL RIGHT I SAID HURRAH LOOK HERE I'M GLAD I DIDN'T FINISH THE POOR BEGGAR LISTEN TO THIS FROM THE TURON BANNER
5361-27492-0058 BUSH RANGING REVIVED THE GOOD OLD DAYS HAVE APPARENTLY NOT PASSED AWAY FOR EVER WHEN MAIL ROBBERIES AND HAND TO HAND CONFLICTS WITH ARMED ROBBERS WERE MATTERS OF WEEKLY OCCURRENCE
5361-27492-0059 THE COMPARATIVE LULL OBSERVABLE IN SUCH EXCITING OCCURRENCES OF LATE HAS BEEN PROVED TO BE BUT THE OMINOUS HUSH OF THE ELEMENTS THAT PRECEDES THE TEMPEST WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS THE MINING COMMUNITY HAS BEEN STARTLED BY THE DISCOVERY OF THE NOTORIOUS GANG OF BUSH RANGERS STARLIGHT AND THE MARSTONS
5361-27492-0060 DOMICILED IN THE VERY HEART OF THE DIGGINGS ATTIRED AS ORDINARY MINERS AND FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES POSSIBLY LEADING THE LABORIOUS LIVES PROPER TO THE AVOCATION
5361-27492-0061 JAMES MARSTON HAD RECENTLY MARRIED A YOUNG PERSON OF MOST RESPECTABLE FAMILY AND PREPOSSESSING APPEARANCE AS FAR AS MAY BE INFERRED FROM THIS STEP AND HIS SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT HE HAD CUT LOOSE FROM HIS FORMER HABITUDES
5361-27492-0062 WORKED AN ADJOINING CLAIM TO THE ARIZONA SLUICING COMPANY WITH THE RESPECTED SHAREHOLDERS OF WHICH THEY WERE ON TERMS OF INTIMACY THE WELL KNOWN STARLIGHT AS MISTER FRANK HAUGHTON
5361-27492-0063 BECAME PARTNER AND TENT MATE WITH THE HON MISTER CLIFFORD AND MISTER HASTINGS AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY IN WHICH THE MANNERS AND BEARING OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN PERMITTED HIM TO MINGLE WITHOUT SUSPICION OF DETECTION SUDDENLY INFORMATION WAS FURNISHED TO THE POLICE RESPECTING ALL THREE MEN
5361-27492-0064 SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT SIR FERDINAND MORRINGER PROMPTLY ARRANGED FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS ACTION OF THREE PARTIES OF POLICE WITH THE HOPE OF CAPTURING ALL THREE OUTLAWS BUT IN TWO CASES THE BIRDS WERE FLOWN STARLIGHT'S
5361-27492-0065 A HALF CASTE NAMED WARRIGAL HAD BEEN OBSERVED ON THE FIELD THE DAY BEFORE BY HIM HE WAS DOUBTLESS FURNISHED WITH A WARNING AND THE HORSE UPON WHICH HE LEFT HIS ABODE SHORTLY BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF SIR FERDINAND
5361-27492-0066 THE ELDER MARSTON HAD ALSO ELUDED THE POLICE BUT JAMES MARSTON HINDERED POSSIBLY BY DOMESTIC TIES WAS CAPTURED AT HIS COTTAGE AT SPECIMEN GULLY FOR HIM SYMPATHY HAS BEEN UNIVERSALLY EXPRESSED
5361-27492-0067 HE IS REGARDED RATHER AS A VICTIM THAN AS AN ACTIVE AGENT IN THE MANY CRIMINAL OFFENCES CHARGEABLE TO THE ACCOUNT OF STARLIGHT'S GANG
5361-27492-0068 HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN BADLY WOUNDED THE OTHER TROOPER REPORTS THAT HE WAS SHOT DOWN AND THE PARTY ATTACKED BY PERSONS CONCEALED IN THE THICK TIMBER NEAR WILD HORSE CREEK AT THE EDGE OF BARGO BRUSH IN THE CONFUSION THAT ENSUED THE PRISONER ESCAPED IT WAS AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT WALSH WAS FATALLY INJURED
5361-27492-0069 BUT OUR LATEST REPORT GIVES GOOD HOPE OF HIS RECOVERY
