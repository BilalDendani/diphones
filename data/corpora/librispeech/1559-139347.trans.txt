1559-139347-0000 NOT ONLY WERE THE FAZENDER AND HIS FAMILY TO START ON A VOYAGE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BUT AS WE SHALL SEE
1559-139347-0001 IN BEHOLDING EVERY ONE HAPPY AROUND HIM JOAM FORGOT THE ANXIETIES WHICH APPEARED TO TROUBLE HIS LIFE
1559-139347-0002 HE REGAINED HIS FORMER ACTIVITY HIS PEOPLE REJOICED EXCEEDINGLY AT SEEING HIM AGAIN AT WORK HIS MORAL SELF REACTED AGAINST HIS PHYSICAL SELF AND JOAM AGAIN BECAME THE ACTIVE ENERGETIC MAN OF HIS EARLIER YEARS
1559-139347-0003 UNDER THE INVIGORATING INFLUENCES OF FORESTS FIELDS AND RUNNING WATERS MOREOVER THE FEW WEEKS THAT WERE TO PRECEDE HIS DEPARTURE HAD BEEN WELL EMPLOYED AT THIS PERIOD AS WE HAVE JUST REMARKED THE COURSE OF THE AMAZON WAS NOT YET FURROWED BY THE NUMBERLESS STEAM VESSELS
1559-139347-0004 THE SERVICE WAS WORKED BY INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT ALONE AND OFTEN THE BOATS WERE ONLY EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS OF THE RIVERSIDE ESTABLISHMENTS
1559-139347-0005 HOLLOWED OUT BY FIRE AND FINISHED WITH THE AX POINTED AND LIGHT IN FRONT AND HEAVY AND BROAD IN THE STERN ABLE TO CARRY FROM ONE TO A DOZEN PADDLERS
1559-139347-0006 AND LEAVING ON EACH SIDE A GANGWAY FOR THE ROWERS OR JANGADA RAFTS OF NO PARTICULAR SHAPE PROPELLED BY A TRIANGULAR SAIL AND SURMOUNTED BY A CABIN OF MUD AND STRAW WHICH SERVED THE INDIAN AND HIS FAMILY FOR A FLOATING HOME
1559-139347-0007 THESE THREE KINDS OF CRAFT FORMED THE LESSER FLOTILLA OF THE AMAZON AND WERE ONLY SUITED FOR A MODERATE TRAFFIC OF PASSENGERS OR MERCHANDISE LARGER VESSELS HOWEVER EXISTED EITHER VIGILINGAS
1559-139347-0008 AND WHICH IN CALM WEATHER WERE ROWED BY FOUR LONG PADDLES
1559-139347-0009 OR COBERTAS OF TWENTY TONS BURDEN A KIND OF JUNK WITH A POOP BEHIND AND A CABIN DOWN BELOW
1559-139347-0010 AND PROPELLED WHEN THE WIND FELL BY SIX LONG SWEEPS WHICH INDIANS WORKED FROM A FORECASTLE BUT NEITHER OF THESE VESSELS SATISFIED JOAM GARRAL FROM THE MOMENT THAT HE HAD RESOLVED TO DESCEND THE AMAZON HE HAD THOUGHT OF MAKING THE MOST OF THE VOYAGE BY CARRYING A HUGE CONVOY OF GOODS INTO PARA
1559-139347-0011 WHO WOULD FOR VERY GOOD REASONS HAVE PREFERRED SOME RAPID STEAMBOAT BUT THOUGH THE MEANS OF TRANSPORT DEVISED BY JOAM WERE PRIMITIVE IN THE EXTREME HE WAS GOING TO TAKE WITH HIM A NUMEROUS FOLLOWING AND ABANDON HIMSELF TO THE STREAM UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS OF COMFORT AND SECURITY
1559-139347-0012 HAD BEEN CUT AWAY FROM THE BANK AND CARRIED DOWN THE AMAZON WITH ALL THAT COMPOSED THE FAMILY OF THE FAZENDER MASTERS AND SERVANTS IN THEIR DWELLINGS THEIR COTTAGES AND THEIR HUTS THE SETTLEMENT OF IQUITOS INCLUDED A PART OF THOSE MAGNIFICENT FORESTS WHICH IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICTS OF SOUTH AMERICA
1559-139347-0013 ARE PRACTICALLY INEXHAUSTIBLE JOAM GARRAL THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE WOODS WHICH WERE RICH IN THE MOST PRECIOUS AND DIVERSE SPECIES ADAPTED FOR JOINERY CABINET WORK SHIP BUILDING AND CARPENTRY AND FROM THEM HE ANNUALLY DREW CONSIDERABLE PROFITS
1559-139347-0014 THE RIVER WAS THERE IN FRONT OF HIM AND COULD IT NOT BE AS SAFELY AND ECONOMICALLY USED AS A RAILWAY IF ONE EXISTED SO EVERY YEAR JOAM GARRAL FELLED SOME HUNDREDS OF TREES FROM HIS STOCK AND FORMED IMMENSE RAFTS OF FLOATING WOOD OF JOISTS BEAMS AND SLIGHTLY SQUARED TRUNKS
1559-139347-0015 WHICH WERE TAKEN TO PARA IN CHARGE OF CAPABLE PILOTS WHO WERE THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE DEPTHS OF THE RIVER AND THE DIRECTION OF ITS CURRENTS
1559-139347-0016 ONLY WHEN THE RAFT WAS MADE UP HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE TO BENITO
1559-139347-0017 THE BEGINNING OF JUNE WAS THE BEST SEASON TO START FOR THE WATERS INCREASED BY THE FLOODS OF THE UPPER BASIN WOULD GRADUALLY AND GRADUALLY SUBSIDE UNTIL THE MONTH OF OCTOBER THE FIRST STEPS HAD THUS TO BE TAKEN WITHOUT DELAY
1559-139347-0018 WHICH WAS SITUATED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE NANAY AND THE AMAZON THAT IS TO SAY THE WHOLE RIVER SIDE OF THE FAZENDA TO FORM THE ENORMOUS MASS FOR SUCH WERE THE JANGADAS OR RIVER RAFTS WHICH ATTAINED THE DIMENSIONS OF A SMALL ISLAND
1559-139347-0019 IT WAS IN THIS JANGADA SAFER THAN ANY OTHER VESSEL OF THE COUNTRY LARGER THAN A HUNDRED EGARITEAS OR VIGILINGAS COUPLED TOGETHER THAT JOAM GARRAL PROPOSED TO EMBARK WITH HIS FAMILY HIS SERVANTS AND HIS MERCHANDISE EXCELLENT IDEA HAD CRIED MINHA
1559-139347-0020 CLAPPING HER HANDS WHEN SHE LEARNED HER FATHER'S SCHEME
1559-139347-0021 WON'T IT TAKE RATHER LONG OBSERVED MANOEL
1559-139347-0022 IT WOULD TAKE SOME TIME OBVIOUSLY BUT THE INTERESTED OBSERVATION OF THE YOUNG DOCTOR RECEIVED NO ATTENTION FROM ANY ONE JOAM GARRAL THEN CALLED IN AN INDIAN WHO WAS THE PRINCIPAL MANAGER OF THE FAZENDA
1559-139347-0023 THE JANGADA MUST BE BUILT AND READY TO LAUNCH WE'LL SET TO WORK THIS VERY DAY SIR IT WAS A HEAVY TASK
1559-139347-0024 THEY DID WONDERS SOME PEOPLE UNACCUSTOMED TO THESE GREAT TREE MASSACRES WOULD PERHAPS HAVE GROANED TO SEE GIANTS MANY HUNDRED YEARS OLD FALL IN A FEW HOURS BENEATH THE AXES OF THE WOODMEN
1559-139347-0025 THAT THE FELLING OF THIS HALF MILE OF FOREST WOULD SCARCELY LEAVE AN APPRECIABLE VOID
1559-139347-0026 WHICH OBSTRUCTED IT BEFORE TAKING TO THE SAW AND THE AX THEY HAD ARMED THEMSELVES WITH A FELLING SWORD THAT INDISPENSABLE TOOL OF EVERY ONE WHO DESIRES TO PENETRATE THE AMAZONIAN FORESTS A LARGE BLADE SLIGHTLY CURVED WIDE AND FLAT AND TWO OR THREE FEET LONG
1559-139347-0027 AND STRONGLY HANDLED WHICH THE NATIVES WIELD WITH CONSUMMATE ADDRESS IN A FEW HOURS WITH THE HELP OF THE FELLING SWORD THEY HAD CLEARED THE GROUND CUT DOWN THE UNDERWOOD AND OPENED LARGE GAPS INTO THE DENSEST PORTIONS OF THE WOOD IN THIS WAY THE WORK PROGRESSED
1559-139347-0028 THE GROUND WAS CLEARED IN FRONT OF THE WOODMEN THE OLD TRUNKS WERE DIVESTED OF THEIR CLOTHING OF CREEPERS CACTI FERNS MOSSES AND BROMELIAS THEY WERE STRIPPED NAKED TO THE BARK UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE BARK ITSELF WAS STRIPPED FROM OFF THEM THEN THE WHOLE OF THE WORKERS BEFORE WHOM FLED
1559-139347-0029 AN INNUMERABLE CROWD OF MONKEYS WHO WERE HARDLY THEIR SUPERIORS IN AGILITY SLUNG THEMSELVES INTO THE UPPER BRANCHES SAWING OFF THE HEAVIER BOUGHS AND CUTTING DOWN THE TOPMOST LIMBS WHICH HAD TO BE CLEARED AWAY ON THE SPOT VERY SOON THERE REMAINED ONLY A DOOMED FOREST
1559-139347-0030 WITH LONG BARE STEMS BEREFT OF THEIR CROWNS THROUGH WHICH THE SUN LUXURIANTLY RAYED ON TO THE HUMID SOIL WHICH PERHAPS ITS SHOTS HAD NEVER BEFORE CARESSED
1559-139347-0031 EITHER IN CARPENTRY OR CABINET WORK THERE SHOOTING UP LIKE COLUMNS OF IVORY RINGED WITH BROWN WERE WAX PALMS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET HIGH AND FOUR FEET THICK AT THEIR BASE WHITE CHESTNUTS WHICH YIELD THE THREE CORNERED NUTS
1559-139347-0032 UNEXCELLED FOR BUILDING PURPOSES BARRIGUDOS MEASURING A COUPLE OF YARDS AT THE SWELLING WHICH IS FOUND AT A FEW FEET ABOVE THE EARTH TREES WITH SHINING RUSSET BARK DOTTED WITH GRAY TUBERCLES EACH POINTED STEM OF WHICH SUPPORTS A HORIZONTAL PARASOL
1559-139347-0033 AND BOMBAX OF SUPERB STATURE WITH ITS STRAIGHT AND SMOOTH WHITE STEM AMONG THESE MAGNIFICENT SPECIMENS OF THE AMAZONIAN FLORA THERE FELL MANY QUATIBOS WHOSE ROSY CANOPIES TOWERED ABOVE THE NEIGHBORING TREES WHOSE FRUITS ARE LIKE LITTLE CUPS WITH ROWS OF CHESTNUTS RANGED WITHIN
1559-139347-0034 AND BESIDES THERE WAS THE IRONWOOD
1559-139347-0035 NEARLY BLACK IN ITS SKIN AND SO CLOSE GRAINED THAT OF IT THE INDIANS MAKE THEIR BATTLE AXES JACARANDAS MORE PRECIOUS THAN MAHOGANY
1559-139347-0036 SAPUCAIAS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET HIGH BUTTRESSED BY NATURAL ARCHES WHICH STARTING FROM THREE YARDS FROM THEIR BASE REJOIN THE TREE SOME THIRTY FEET UP THE STEM TWINING THEMSELVES ROUND THE TRUNK
1559-139347-0037 WHOSE HEAD EXPANDS IN A BOUQUET OF VEGETABLE FIREWORKS MADE UP OF THE YELLOW PURPLE AND SNOWY WHITE OF THE PARASITIC PLANTS THREE WEEKS AFTER THE WORK WAS BEGUN NOT ONE WAS STANDING OF ALL THE TREES WHICH HAD COVERED THE ANGLE OF THE AMAZON AND THE NANAY THE CLEARANCE WAS COMPLETE
1559-139347-0038 NOT A STICK OF YOUNG OR OLD WOOD WAS LEFT TO MARK THE BOUNDARY OF A FUTURE CLEARING NOT EVEN AN ANGLE TO MARK THE LIMIT OF THE DENUDATION
1559-139347-0039 OVER WHICH THE COMING SPRING WOULD STILL SPREAD ITS VERDANT CLOAK THIS SQUARE SPACE
1559-139347-0040 COFFEE SHRUBS SUGAR CANES ARROWROOT MAIZE AND PEANUTS WOULD OCCUPY THE GROUND SO RECENTLY COVERED BY THE TREES THE LAST WEEK OF THE MONTH HAD NOT ARRIVED WHEN THE TRUNKS CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR VARIETIES AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY
1559-139347-0041 WHICH WITH THE DIFFERENT HABITATIONS FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE CREW WOULD BECOME A VERITABLE FLOATING VILLAGE
1559-139347-0042 WOULD RAISE IT AND CARRY IT FOR HUNDREDS OF LEAGUES TO THE ATLANTIC COAST THE WHOLE TIME THE WORK WAS GOING ON JOAM GARRAL HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN SUPERINTENDING IT FROM THE CLEARING TO THE BANK OF THE FAZENDA HE HAD FORMED A LARGE MOUND ON WHICH THE PORTIONS OF THE RAFT WERE DISPOSED
1559-139347-0043 AND TO THIS MATTER HE HAD ATTENDED ENTIRELY HIMSELF
1559-139347-0044 WITH THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DEPARTURE THOUGH THE OLD NEGRESS COULD NOT BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WANTED TO GO OR WHAT THEY HOPED TO SEE
1559-139347-0045 FOR THEM IT WAS A PERMANENT DEPARTURE AND THERE WERE A THOUSAND DETAILS TO LOOK AFTER FOR SETTLING IN THE OTHER COUNTRY IN WHICH THE YOUNG MULATTO WAS TO LIVE WITH THE MISTRESS TO WHOM SHE WAS SO DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED
1559-139347-0046 MINHA VALDEZ WOULD BE THE SAME TO HER AS MINHA GARRAL AND TO CHECK HER SPIRITS SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE SEPARATED FROM HER MISTRESS AND THAT WAS NEVER THOUGHT OF
