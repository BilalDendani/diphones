1012-133424-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE MERMAIDS LAGOON IF YOU SHUT YOUR EYES AND ARE A LUCKY ONE YOU MAY SEE AT TIMES A SHAPELESS POOL OF LOVELY PALE COLOURS SUSPENDED IN THE DARKNESS THEN IF YOU SQUEEZE YOUR EYES TIGHTER
1012-133424-0001 THE POOL BEGINS TO TAKE SHAPE AND THE COLOURS BECOME SO VIVID THAT WITH ANOTHER SQUEEZE THEY MUST GO ON FIRE BUT JUST BEFORE THEY GO ON FIRE YOU SEE THE LAGOON THIS IS THE NEAREST YOU EVER GET TO IT ON THE MAINLAND JUST ONE HEAVENLY MOMENT
1012-133424-0002 IF THERE COULD BE TWO MOMENTS YOU MIGHT SEE THE SURF AND HEAR THE MERMAIDS SINGING THE CHILDREN OFTEN SPENT LONG SUMMER DAYS ON THIS LAGOON SWIMMING OR FLOATING MOST OF THE TIME PLAYING THE MERMAID GAMES IN THE WATER AND SO FORTH
1012-133424-0003 YOU MUST NOT THINK FROM THIS THAT THE MERMAIDS WERE ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THEM ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS AMONG WENDY'S LASTING REGRETS THAT ALL THE TIME SHE WAS ON THE ISLAND SHE NEVER HAD A CIVIL WORD FROM ONE OF THEM
1012-133424-0004 WHEN SHE STOLE SOFTLY TO THE EDGE OF THE LAGOON SHE MIGHT SEE THEM BY THE SCORE ESPECIALLY ON MAROONERS ROCK WHERE THEY LOVED TO BASK COMBING OUT THEIR HAIR IN A LAZY WAY THAT QUITE IRRITATED HER OR SHE MIGHT EVEN SWIM ON TIPTOE AS IT WERE TO WITHIN A YARD OF THEM
1012-133424-0005 BUT THEN THEY SAW HER AND DIVED PROBABLY SPLASHING HER WITH THEIR TAILS NOT BY ACCIDENT BUT INTENTIONALLY THEY TREATED ALL THE BOYS IN THE SAME WAY EXCEPT OF COURSE PETER WHO CHATTED WITH THEM ON MAROONERS ROCK BY THE HOUR
1012-133424-0006 AND SAT ON THEIR TAILS WHEN THEY GOT CHEEKY HE GAVE WENDY ONE OF THEIR COMBS THE MOST HAUNTING TIME AT WHICH TO SEE THEM IS AT THE TURN OF THE MOON WHEN THEY UTTER STRANGE WAILING CRIES BUT THE LAGOON IS DANGEROUS FOR MORTALS THEN
1012-133424-0007 WENDY HAD NEVER SEEN THE LAGOON BY MOONLIGHT LESS FROM FEAR
1012-133424-0008 THAN BECAUSE SHE HAD STRICT RULES ABOUT EVERY ONE BEING IN BED BY SEVEN SHE WAS OFTEN AT THE LAGOON HOWEVER ON SUNNY DAYS AFTER RAIN WHEN THE MERMAIDS COME UP IN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBERS TO PLAY WITH THEIR BUBBLES
1012-133424-0009 THE BUBBLES OF MANY COLOURS MADE IN RAINBOW WATER THEY TREAT AS BALLS HITTING THEM GAILY FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH THEIR TAILS
1012-133424-0010 THE GOALS ARE AT EACH END OF THE RAINBOW AND THE KEEPERS ONLY ARE ALLOWED TO USE THEIR HANDS SOMETIMES A DOZEN OF THESE GAMES WILL BE GOING ON IN THE LAGOON AT A TIME AND IT IS QUITE A PRETTY SIGHT
1012-133424-0011 BUT THE MOMENT THE CHILDREN TRIED TO JOIN IN THEY HAD TO PLAY BY THEMSELVES FOR THE MERMAIDS IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED NEVERTHELESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY SECRETLY WATCHED THE INTERLOPERS AND WERE NOT ABOVE TAKING AN IDEA FROM THEM
1012-133424-0012 FOR JOHN INTRODUCED A NEW WAY OF HITTING THE BUBBLE WITH THE HEAD INSTEAD OF THE HAND AND THE MERMAIDS ADOPTED IT THIS IS THE ONE MARK THAT JOHN HAS LEFT ON THE NEVERLAND
1012-133424-0013 IT MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN RATHER PRETTY TO SEE THE CHILDREN RESTING ON A ROCK FOR HALF AN HOUR AFTER THEIR MID DAY MEAL WENDY INSISTED ON THEIR DOING THIS AND IT HAD TO BE A REAL REST EVEN THOUGH THE MEAL WAS MAKE BELIEVE SO THEY LAY THERE IN THE SUN
1012-133424-0014 AND THEIR BODIES GLISTENED IN IT WHILE SHE SAT BESIDE THEM AND LOOKED IMPORTANT IT WAS ONE SUCH DAY AND THEY WERE ALL ON MAROONERS ROCK THE ROCK WAS NOT MUCH LARGER THAN THEIR GREAT BED BUT OF COURSE THEY ALL KNEW HOW NOT TO TAKE UP MUCH ROOM AND THEY WERE DOZING
1012-133424-0015 OR AT LEAST LYING WITH THEIR EYES SHUT AND PINCHING OCCASIONALLY WHEN THEY THOUGHT WENDY WAS NOT LOOKING SHE WAS VERY BUSY STITCHING WHILE SHE STITCHED A CHANGE CAME TO THE LAGOON LITTLE SHIVERS RAN OVER IT
1012-133424-0016 AND THE SUN WENT AWAY AND SHADOWS STOLE ACROSS THE WATER TURNING IT COLD WENDY COULD NO LONGER SEE TO THREAD HER NEEDLE AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP THE LAGOON THAT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH A LAUGHING PLACE SEEMED FORMIDABLE AND UNFRIENDLY
1012-133424-0017 IT WAS NOT SHE KNEW THAT NIGHT HAD COME BUT SOMETHING AS DARK AS NIGHT HAD COME NO WORSE THAN THAT IT HAD NOT COME BUT IT HAD SENT THAT SHIVER THROUGH THE SEA TO SAY THAT IT WAS COMING
1012-133424-0018 WHAT WAS IT THERE CROWDED UPON HER ALL THE STORIES SHE HAD BEEN TOLD OF MAROONERS ROCK SO CALLED BECAUSE EVIL CAPTAINS PUT SAILORS ON IT AND LEAVE THEM THERE TO DROWN THEY DROWN WHEN THE TIDE RISES FOR THEN IT IS SUBMERGED
1012-133424-0019 OF COURSE SHE SHOULD HAVE ROUSED THE CHILDREN AT ONCE NOT MERELY BECAUSE OF THE UNKNOWN THAT WAS STALKING TOWARD THEM BUT BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER GOOD FOR THEM TO SLEEP ON A ROCK GROWN CHILLY BUT SHE WAS A YOUNG MOTHER AND SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS
1012-133424-0020 SHE THOUGHT YOU SIMPLY MUST STICK TO YOUR RULE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE MID DAY MEAL SO THOUGH FEAR WAS UPON HER AND SHE LONGED TO HEAR MALE VOICES SHE WOULD NOT WAKEN THEM EVEN WHEN SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF MUFFLED OARS
1012-133424-0021 THOUGH HER HEART WAS IN HER MOUTH SHE DID NOT WAKEN THEM SHE STOOD OVER THEM TO LET THEM HAVE THEIR SLEEP OUT WAS IT NOT BRAVE OF WENDY IT WAS WELL FOR THOSE BOYS THEN THAT THERE WAS ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD SNIFF DANGER EVEN IN HIS SLEEP PETER
1012-133424-0022 SPRANG ERECT AS WIDE AWAKE AT ONCE AS A DOG AND WITH ONE WARNING CRY HE ROUSED THE OTHERS HE STOOD MOTIONLESS ONE HAND TO HIS EAR PIRATES HE CRIED
1012-133424-0023 THE OTHERS CAME CLOSER TO HIM A STRANGE SMILE WAS PLAYING ABOUT HIS FACE AND WENDY SAW IT AND SHUDDERED WHILE THAT SMILE WAS ON HIS FACE NO ONE DARED ADDRESS HIM
1012-133424-0024 THE ORDER CAME SHARP AND INCISIVE DIVE THERE WAS A GLEAM OF LEGS AND INSTANTLY THE LAGOON SEEMED DESERTED MAROONERS ROCK STOOD ALONE IN THE FORBIDDING WATERS AS IF IT WERE ITSELF MAROONED THE BOAT DREW NEARER
1012-133424-0025 IT WAS THE PIRATE DINGHY WITH THREE FIGURES IN HER SMEE AND STARKEY AND THE THIRD A CAPTIVE NO OTHER THAN TIGER LILY HER HANDS AND ANKLES WERE TIED AND SHE KNEW WHAT WAS TO BE HER FATE SHE WAS TO BE LEFT ON THE ROCK TO PERISH
1012-133424-0026 AN END TO ONE OF HER RACE MORE TERRIBLE THAN DEATH BY FIRE OR TORTURE FOR IS IT NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE TRIBE THAT THERE IS NO PATH THROUGH WATER TO THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUND YET HER FACE WAS IMPASSIVE SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A CHIEF SHE MUST DIE AS A CHIEF'S DAUGHTER
1012-133424-0027 IT IS ENOUGH THEY HAD CAUGHT HER BOARDING THE PIRATE SHIP WITH A KNIFE IN HER MOUTH NO WATCH WAS KEPT ON THE SHIP IT BEING HOOK'S BOAST THAT THE WIND OF HIS NAME GUARDED THE SHIP FOR A MILE AROUND NOW HER FATE WOULD HELP TO GUARD IT ALSO
1012-133424-0028 IN THE GLOOM THAT THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM THE TWO PIRATES DID NOT SEE THE ROCK TILL THEY CRASHED INTO IT LUFF YOU LUBBER CRIED AN IRISH VOICE THAT WAS S M E E HERE'S THE ROCK NOW THEN
1012-133424-0029 AND LEAVE HER HERE TO DROWN IT WAS THE WORK OF ONE BRUTAL MOMENT TO LAND THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL ON THE ROCK SHE WAS TOO PROUD TO OFFER A VAIN RESISTANCE QUITE NEAR THE ROCK BUT OUT OF SIGHT TWO HEADS WERE BOBBING UP AND DOWN PETER'S AND WENDY'S
1012-133424-0030 WENDY WAS CRYING FOR IT WAS THE FIRST TRAGEDY SHE HAD SEEN PETER HAD SEEN MANY TRAGEDIES BUT HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM ALL HE WAS LESS SORRY THAN WENDY FOR TIGER LILY IT WAS TWO AGAINST ONE THAT ANGERED HIM AND HE MEANT TO SAVE HER
1012-133424-0031 BUT HE WAS NEVER ONE TO CHOOSE THE EASY WAY
1012-133424-0032 AHOY THERE YOU LUBBERS HE CALLED IT WAS A MARVELLOUS IMITATION THE CAPTAIN SAID THE PIRATES STARING AT EACH OTHER IN SURPRISE HE MUST BE SWIMMING OUT TO US STARKEY SAID WHEN THEY HAD LOOKED FOR HIM IN VAIN

1012-133424-0036 OF COURSE WENDY WAS VERY ELATED OVER PETER'S CLEVERNESS BUT SHE KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE ELATED ALSO AND VERY LIKELY CROW AND THUS BETRAY HIMSELF SO AT ONCE HER HAND WENT OUT TO COVER HIS MOUTH BUT IT WAS STAYED EVEN IN THE ACT FOR
1012-133424-0037 RANG OVER THE LAGOON IN HOOK'S VOICE AND THIS TIME IT WAS NOT PETER WHO HAD SPOKEN PETER MAY HAVE BEEN ABOUT TO CROW
1012-133424-0038 NOW WENDY UNDERSTOOD THE REAL HOOK WAS ALSO IN THE WATER HE WAS SWIMMING TO THE BOAT AND AS HIS MEN SHOWED A LIGHT TO GUIDE HIM HE HAD SOON REACHED THEM IN THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN WENDY SAW HIS HOOK GRIP THE BOAT'S SIDE
1012-133424-0039 SHE SAW HIS EVIL SWARTHY FACE AS HE ROSE DRIPPING FROM THE WATER AND QUAKING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SWIM AWAY BUT PETER WOULD NOT BUDGE HE WAS TINGLING WITH LIFE AND ALSO TOP HEAVY WITH CONCEIT AM I NOT A WONDER
1012-133424-0040 OH I AM A WONDER HE WHISPERED TO HER AND THOUGH SHE THOUGHT SO ALSO SHE WAS REALLY GLAD FOR THE SAKE OF HIS REPUTATION THAT NO ONE HEARD HIM EXCEPT HERSELF HE SIGNED TO HER TO LISTEN THE TWO PIRATES WERE VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT HAD BROUGHT THEIR CAPTAIN TO THEM
1012-133424-0041 BUT HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HIS HOOK IN A POSITION OF PROFOUND MELANCHOLY CAPTAIN IS ALL WELL THEY ASKED TIMIDLY BUT HE ANSWERED WITH A HOLLOW MOAN HE SIGHS SAID SMEE HE SIGHS AGAIN SAID STARKEY
1012-133424-0042 AND YET A THIRD TIME HE SIGHS SAID SMEE THEN AT LAST HE SPOKE PASSIONATELY THE GAME'S UP HE CRIED THOSE BOYS HAVE FOUND A MOTHER AFFRIGHTED THOUGH SHE WAS WENDY SWELLED WITH PRIDE
1012-133424-0043 O EVIL DAY CRIED STARKEY WHAT'S A MOTHER ASKED THE IGNORANT SMEE WENDY WAS SO SHOCKED THAT SHE EXCLAIMED HE DOESN'T KNOW AND ALWAYS AFTER THIS SHE FELT THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE A PET PIRATE SMEE WOULD BE HER ONE
1012-133424-0044 PETER PULLED HER BENEATH THE WATER FOR HOOK HAD STARTED UP CRYING WHAT WAS THAT I HEARD NOTHING SAID STARKEY RAISING THE LANTERN OVER THE WATERS AND AS THE PIRATES LOOKED THEY SAW A STRANGE SIGHT IT WAS THE NEST I HAVE TOLD YOU OF
1012-133424-0045 FLOATING ON THE LAGOON AND THE NEVER BIRD WAS SITTING ON IT SEE SAID HOOK IN ANSWER TO SMEE'S QUESTION THAT IS A MOTHER WHAT A LESSON THE NEST MUST HAVE FALLEN INTO THE WATER BUT WOULD THE MOTHER DESERT HER EGGS NO THERE WAS A BREAK IN HIS VOICE
1012-133424-0046 AS IF FOR A MOMENT HE RECALLED INNOCENT DAYS WHEN BUT HE BRUSHED AWAY THIS WEAKNESS WITH HIS HOOK SMEE MUCH IMPRESSED GAZED AT THE BIRD AS THE NEST WAS BORNE PAST BUT THE MORE SUSPICIOUS STARKEY SAID IF SHE IS A MOTHER
1012-133424-0047 PERHAPS SHE IS HANGING ABOUT HERE TO HELP PETER HOOK WINCED AY HE SAID THAT IS THE FEAR THAT HAUNTS ME HE WAS ROUSED FROM THIS DEJECTION BY SMEE'S EAGER VOICE CAPTAIN SAID SMEE

1012-133424-0068 YES YES THEY ANSWERED EAGERLY WELL THEN HE CRIED I AM PETER PAN PAN IN A MOMENT HOOK WAS HIMSELF AGAIN AND SMEE AND STARKEY WERE HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN
1012-133424-0069 NOW WE HAVE HIM HOOK SHOUTED INTO THE WATER SMEE STARKEY MIND THE BOAT TAKE HIM DEAD OR ALIVE HE LEAPED AS HE SPOKE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CAME THE GAY VOICE OF PETER
1012-133424-0070 ARE YOU READY BOYS AY AY FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE LAGOON
1012-133424-0071 THE FIGHT WAS SHORT AND SHARP FIRST TO DRAW BLOOD WAS JOHN WHO GALLANTLY CLIMBED INTO THE BOAT AND HELD STARKEY THERE WAS FIERCE STRUGGLE IN WHICH THE CUTLASS WAS TORN FROM THE PIRATE'S GRASP HE WRIGGLED OVERBOARD AND JOHN LEAPT AFTER HIM THE DINGHY DRIFTED AWAY
1012-133424-0072 HERE AND THERE A HEAD BOBBED UP IN THE WATER AND THERE WAS A FLASH OF STEEL FOLLOWED BY A CRY OR A WHOOP IN THE CONFUSION SOME STRUCK AT THEIR OWN SIDE THE CORKSCREW OF SMEE GOT TOOTLES IN THE FOURTH RIB
1012-133424-0073 WHERE ALL THIS TIME WAS PETER HE WAS SEEKING BIGGER GAME THE OTHERS WERE ALL BRAVE BOYS AND THEY MUST NOT BE BLAMED FOR BACKING FROM THE PIRATE CAPTAIN HIS IRON CLAW MADE A CIRCLE OF DEAD WATER ROUND HIM FROM WHICH THEY FLED LIKE AFFRIGHTED FISHES
1012-133424-0074 BUT THERE WAS ONE WHO DID NOT FEAR HIM THERE WAS ONE PREPARED TO ENTER THAT CIRCLE STRANGELY IT WAS NOT IN THE WATER THAT THEY MET HOOK ROSE TO THE ROCK TO BREATHE AND AT THE SAME MOMENT PETER SCALED IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
1012-133424-0075 THE ROCK WAS SLIPPERY AS A BALL AND THEY HAD TO CRAWL RATHER THAN CLIMB NEITHER KNEW THAT THE OTHER WAS COMING EACH FEELING FOR A GRIP MET THE OTHER'S ARM IN SURPRISE THEY RAISED THEIR HEADS
1012-133424-0076 HE HAD ONE FEELING ONLY GLADNESS AND HE GNASHED HIS PRETTY TEETH WITH JOY QUICK AS THOUGHT HE SNATCHED A KNIFE FROM HOOK'S BELT AND WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE IT HOME WHEN HE SAW THAT HE WAS HIGHER UP THE ROCK THAT HIS FOE IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FAIR
1012-133424-0077 HE GAVE THE PIRATE A HAND TO HELP HIM UP IT WAS THEN THAT HOOK BIT HIM NOT THE PAIN OF THIS BUT ITS UNFAIRNESS WAS WHAT DAZED PETER IT MADE HIM QUITE HELPLESS HE COULD ONLY STARE HORRIFIED
1012-133424-0078 EVERY CHILD IS AFFECTED THUS THE FIRST TIME HE IS TREATED UNFAIRLY ALL HE THINKS HE HAS A RIGHT TO WHEN HE COMES TO YOU TO BE YOURS IS FAIRNESS AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN UNFAIR TO HIM HE WILL LOVE YOU AGAIN BUT WILL NEVER AFTERWARDS BE QUITE THE SAME BOY
1012-133424-0079 NO ONE EVER GETS OVER THE FIRST UNFAIRNESS NO ONE EXCEPT PETER HE OFTEN MET IT BUT HE ALWAYS FORGOT IT I SUPPOSE THAT WAS THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND ALL THE REST SO WHEN HE MET IT NOW IT WAS LIKE THE FIRST TIME
1012-133424-0080 AND HE COULD JUST STARE HELPLESS TWICE THE IRON HAND CLAWED HIM A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARDS THE OTHER BOYS SAW HOOK IN THE WATER STRIKING WILDLY FOR THE SHIP NO ELATION ON THE PESTILENT FACE NOW ONLY WHITE FEAR
1012-133424-0081 FOR THE CROCODILE WAS IN DOGGED PURSUIT OF HIM ON ORDINARY OCCASIONS THE BOYS WOULD HAVE SWUM ALONGSIDE CHEERING BUT NOW THEY WERE UNEASY FOR THEY HAD LOST BOTH PETER AND WENDY AND WERE SCOURING THE LAGOON FOR THEM CALLING THEM BY NAME THEY FOUND THE DINGHY AND WENT HOME IN IT SHOUTING
1012-133424-0082 BUT NO ANSWER CAME SAVE MOCKING LAUGHTER FROM THE MERMAIDS THEY MUST BE SWIMMING BACK OR FLYING THE BOYS CONCLUDED THEY WERE NOT VERY ANXIOUS BECAUSE THEY HAD SUCH FAITH IN PETER THEY CHUCKLED BOYLIKE
1012-133424-0083 WHEN THEIR VOICES DIED AWAY THERE CAME COLD SILENCE OVER THE LAGOON AND THEN A FEEBLE CRY HELP HELP TWO SMALL FIGURES WERE BEATING AGAINST THE ROCK
1012-133424-0084 THE GIRL HAD FAINTED AND LAY ON THE BOY'S ARM WITH A LAST EFFORT PETER PULLED HER UP THE ROCK AND THEN LAY DOWN BESIDE HER EVEN AS HE ALSO FAINTED HE SAW THAT THE WATER WAS RISING HE KNEW THAT THEY WOULD SOON BE DROWNED BUT HE COULD DO NO MORE
1012-133424-0085 AS THEY LAY SIDE BY SIDE A MERMAID CAUGHT WENDY BY THE FEET AND BEGAN PULLING HER SOFTLY INTO THE WATER
1012-133424-0086 BUT HE HAD TO TELL HER THE TRUTH WE ARE ON THE ROCK WENDY HE SAID BUT IT IS GROWING SMALLER SOON THE WATER WILL BE OVER IT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW
1012-133424-0087 WE MUST GO SHE SAID ALMOST BRIGHTLY YES HE ANSWERED FAINTLY SHALL WE SWIM OR FLY PETER HE HAD TO TELL HER DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SWIM OR FLY AS FAR AS THE ISLAND WENDY
1012-133424-0088 WITHOUT MY HELP SHE HAD TO ADMIT THAT SHE WAS TOO TIRED HE MOANED WHAT IS IT SHE ASKED ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM AT ONCE I CAN'T HELP YOU WENDY HOOK WOUNDED ME I CAN NEITHER FLY NOR SWIM
1012-133424-0089 LOOK HOW THE WATER IS RISING THEY PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR EYES TO SHUT OUT THE SIGHT THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD SOON BE NO MORE AS THEY SAT THUS SOMETHING BRUSHED AGAINST PETER AS LIGHT AS A KISS
1012-133424-0090 AND STAYED THERE AS IF SAYING TIMIDLY CAN I BE OF ANY USE IT WAS THE TAIL OF A KITE WHICH MICHAEL HAD MADE SOME DAYS BEFORE IT HAD TORN ITSELF OUT OF HIS HAND AND FLOATED AWAY MICHAEL'S KITE PETER SAID WITHOUT INTEREST
1012-133424-0091 BUT NEXT MOMENT HE HAD SEIZED THE TAIL AND WAS PULLING THE KITE TOWARD HIM IT LIFTED MICHAEL OFF THE GROUND HE CRIED WHY SHOULD IT NOT CARRY YOU BOTH OF US IT CAN'T LIFT TWO MICHAEL AND CURLY TRIED
1012-133424-0092 LET US DRAW LOTS WENDY SAID BRAVELY AND YOU A LADY NEVER ALREADY HE HAD TIED THE TAIL ROUND HER SHE CLUNG TO HIM SHE REFUSED TO GO WITHOUT HIM BUT WITH A GOOD BYE WENDY HE PUSHED HER FROM THE ROCK
1012-133424-0093 AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WAS BORNE OUT OF HIS SIGHT PETER WAS ALONE ON THE LAGOON THE ROCK WAS VERY SMALL NOW SOON IT WOULD BE SUBMERGED PALE RAYS OF LIGHT TIPTOED ACROSS THE WATERS
1012-133424-0094 AND BY AND BY THERE WAS TO BE HEARD A SOUND AT ONCE THE MOST MUSICAL AND THE MOST MELANCHOLY IN THE WORLD THE MERMAIDS CALLING TO THE MOON PETER WAS NOT QUITE LIKE OTHER BOYS BUT HE WAS AFRAID AT LAST A TREMOUR RAN THROUGH HIM
1012-133424-0095 LIKE A SHUDDER PASSING OVER THE SEA BUT ON THE SEA ONE SHUDDER FOLLOWS ANOTHER TILL THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THEM AND PETER FELT JUST THE ONE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS STANDING ERECT ON THE ROCK AGAIN WITH THAT SMILE ON HIS FACE AND A DRUM BEATING WITHIN HIM IT WAS SAYING
