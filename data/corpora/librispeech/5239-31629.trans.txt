5239-31629-0000 I WAS IN ONE OF THE FIELDS OF MY ESTATE WHEN THE GROUND TREMBLED UNDER MY FEET NOT AS IT DOES WHEN THE EARTH QUAKES BUT AS THOUGH A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WAS GOING ON WITHIN THE MOUNTAIN A TERROR CAME UPON ME BUT I COULD NOT EXPLAIN MY FEAR
5239-31629-0001 AS I STOOD STILL MONT PELEE SEEMED TO SHUDDER AND A MOANING SOUND ISSUED FROM ITS CRATER IT WAS QUITE DARK THE SUN BEING OBSCURED BY ASHES AND FINE VOLCANIC DUST THE AIR WAS DEAD ABOUT ME
5239-31629-0002 SO DEAD THAT THE FLOATING DUST SEEMINGLY WAS NOT DISTURBED THEN THERE WAS A RENDING CRASHING GRINDING NOISE WHICH I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS SOUNDING AS THOUGH EVERY BIT OF MACHINERY IN THE WORLD HAD SUDDENLY BROKEN DOWN
5239-31629-0003 IT WAS DEAFENING AND THE FLASH OF LIGHT THAT ACCOMPANIED IT WAS BLINDING MORE SO THAN ANY LIGHTNING I HAVE EVER SEEN IT WAS LIKE A TERRIBLE HURRICANE AND WHERE A FRACTION OF A SECOND BEFORE THERE HAD BEEN A PERFECT CALM
5239-31629-0004 I FELT MYSELF DRAWN INTO A VORTEX AND I HAD TO BRACE MYSELF FIRMLY IT WAS LIKE A GREAT EXPRESS TRAIN RUSHING BY AND I WAS DRAWN BY ITS FORCE
5239-31629-0005 TRANSFIXED I STOOD NOT KNOWING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FLEE
5239-31629-0006 ABOVE ITS APEX THERE APPEARED A GREAT BLACK CLOUD WHICH REACHED HIGH IN THE AIR
5239-31629-0007 IT MOVED WITH A RAPIDITY THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYTHING TO ESCAPE IT FROM THE CLOUD CAME EXPLOSIONS THAT SOUNDED AS THOUGH ALL OF THE NAVIES OF THE WORLD WERE IN TITANIC COMBAT
5239-31629-0008 BUT I WAS PREVENTED FROM SEEING THE DESTRUCTION BY A SPUR OF THE HILL THAT SHUT OFF THE VIEW OF THE CITY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL HOW LONG I STOOD THERE INERT
5239-31629-0009 PROBABLY IT WAS ONLY A FEW SECONDS BUT SO VIVID WERE MY IMPRESSIONS THAT IT NOW SEEMS AS THOUGH I STOOD AS A SPECTATOR FOR MANY MINUTES WHEN I RECOVERED POSSESSION OF MY SENSES I RAN TO MY HOUSE AND COLLECTED THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY ALL OF WHOM WERE PANIC STRICKEN
5239-31629-0010 I HURRIED THEM TO THE SEASHORE WHERE WE BOARDED A SMALL STEAMSHIP IN WHICH WE MADE THE TRIP IN SAFETY TO FORT DE FRANCE I KNOW THAT THERE WAS NO FLAME IN THE FIRST WAVE THAT WAS SENT DOWN UPON SAINT PIERRE
5239-31629-0011 NEW CRATERS SEEMED TO BE OPENING ALL ABOUT THE SUMMIT AND LAVA WAS FLOWING IN BROAD STREAMS IN EVERY DIRECTION
5239-31629-0012 WHAT HAPPENED ON THE HORACE THE BRITISH STEAMER HORACE EXPERIENCED THE EFFECT OF THE EXPLOSION WHEN FARTHER FROM LAND
5239-31629-0013 HER DECKS BEING COVERED WITH SEVERAL INCHES OF DUST WHEN SHE WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILES DISTANT WE QUOTE ENGINEER ANDERSON'S STORY ON THE AFTERNOON OF MAY EIGHTH THURSDAY WE NOTICED A PECULIAR HAZE IN THE DIRECTION OF MARTINIQUE
5239-31629-0014 WE ALL REMARKED IN THE ENGINE ROOM THAT THERE MUST BE A HEAVY STORM APPROACHING SEVERAL OF THE SAILORS EXPERIENCED DEEP WATER SEAMEN
5239-31629-0015 SO UNUSUALLY PECULIAR WERE THE WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT WE TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE DURING THE EVENING THAT NIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF MARTINIQUE THERE WAS A VERY BLACK SKY
5239-31629-0016 GREAT FLASHES OF LIGHT AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THOSE ON WATCH NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE GREAT FLASHES OF LIGHTNING IN THE DIRECTION OF MARTINIQUE
5239-31629-0017 NOT UNLIKE THE ENDING OF A DEEP PEAL OF THUNDER
5239-31629-0018 THERE WOULD SUDDENLY COME GREAT FLASHES OF LIGHT FROM THE DARK BANK TOWARD MARTINIQUE
5239-31629-0019 ALL NIGHT THIS CONTINUED AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL DAY CAME THAT THE FLASHES DISAPPEARED THE DARK BANK THAT COVERED THE HORIZON TOWARD MARTINIQUE HOWEVER DID NOT FADE AWAY WITH THE BREAKING OF DAY AND AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING OF THE NINTH FRIDAY
5239-31629-0020 THE WHOLE SECTION OF THE SKY IN THAT DIRECTION SEEMED DARK AND TROUBLED ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK FRIDAY MORNING I WAS SITTING ON ONE OF THE HATCHES AFT WITH SOME OF THE OTHER ENGINEERS AND OFFICERS OF THE SHIP DISCUSSING THE PECULIAR WEATHER PHENOMENA
5239-31629-0021 I NOTICED A SORT OF GRIT THAT GOT INTO MY MOUTH FROM THE END OF THE CIGAR I WAS SMOKING
5239-31629-0022 AS WE WENT FORWARD WE MET ONE OR TWO OF THE SAILORS FROM THE FORECASTLE WHO WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THE DUST THAT WAS FALLING ON THE SHIP THEN WE FOUND THAT THE GRAYISH LOOKING ASH WAS SIFTING ALL OVER THE SHIP BOTH FORWARD AND AFT ASHES RAINED ON THE SHIP
5239-31629-0023 A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE LOOKOUT CALLED DOWN THAT WE WERE RUNNING INTO A FOG BANK DEAD AHEAD FOG BANKS IN THAT SECTION ARE UNHEARD OF AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AT THIS SEASON AND WE WERE MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILES FROM LAND AND WHAT COULD FOG AND SAND BE DOING THERE
5239-31629-0024 BEFORE WE KNEW IT WE WENT INTO THE FOG WHICH PROVED TO BE A BIG DENSE BANK OF THIS SAME SAND AND IT RAINED DOWN ON US FROM EVERY SIDE VENTILATORS WERE QUICKLY BROUGHT TO THEIR PLACES AND LATER EVEN THE HATCHES WERE BATTENED DOWN
5239-31629-0025 THE DUST BECAME SUFFOCATING AND THE MEN AT TIMES HAD ALL THEY COULD DO TO KEEP FROM CHOKING WHAT THE STUFF WAS WE COULD NOT AT FIRST CONJECTURE OR RATHER WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO SPECULATE ON IT FOR WE HAD TO GET OUR SHIP IN SHAPE TO WITHSTAND WE HARDLY KNEW WHAT
5239-31629-0026 JUST AS THE STORM OF SAND WAS AT ITS HEIGHT FOURTH ENGINEER WILD WAS NEARLY SUFFOCATED BY IT BUT WAS EASILY REVIVED
5239-31629-0027 THE ENGINE BECAME CHOKED THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER ANXIOUS MOMENT SHORTLY AFTER NINE O'CLOCK THIRD ENGINEER RENNIE HAD BEEN RUNNING THE DONKEY ENGINE WHEN SUDDENLY IT CHOKED AND WHEN HE FINALLY GOT IT CLEAR FROM THE SAND OR ASHES HE FOUND THE VALVES WERE ALL CUT OUT
5239-31629-0028 THEN CAME THE DANGER THAT IT WOULD GET INTO THE VALVES OF THE ENGINE AND CUT THEM OUT AND FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS ALL HANDS SCURRIED ABOUT AND HELPED MAKE THE ENGINE ROOM TIGHT AND EVEN THEN THE ASH DRIFTED IN AND KEPT ALL THE ENGINE ROOM FORCE WIPING THE ENGINES CLEAR OF IT
5239-31629-0029 TOWARD THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON OF FRIDAY WE WERE PRACTICALLY CLEAR OF THE SAND BUT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT WE RAN INTO A SECOND BANK OF IT THOUGH NOT AS BAD AS THE FIRST WE MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS AND FOUND THE STUFF WAS SUPERIOR TO EMERY DUST
5239-31629-0030 IT CUT DEEPER AND QUICKER AND ONLY ABOUT HALF AS MUCH WAS REQUIRED TO DO THE WORK
5239-31629-0031 SO WE GATHERED IT UP THAT NIGHT THERE WERE MORE OF THE SAME ELECTRIC PHENOMENA TOWARD MARTINIQUE
5239-31629-0032 FOR AN INSTANT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE WATER AND THE FLAME THAT TIDAL WAVE PICKED THE SHIP UP LIKE A CANOE AND THEN SMASHED HER AFTER ONE LIST TO STARBOARD THE SHIP RIGHTED BUT THE MASTS THE BRIDGE THE FUNNEL AND ALL THE UPPER WORKS HAD GONE OVERBOARD
5239-31629-0033 BEFORE I COULD GET UP THREE MEN TUMBLED IN ON TOP OF ME TWO OF THEM WERE DEAD CAPTAIN MUGGAH WENT OVERBOARD STILL CLINGING TO THE FRAGMENTS OF HIS WRECKED BRIDGE DANIEL TAYLOR THE SHIP'S COOPER AND A KITTS NATIVE JUMPED OVERBOARD TO SAVE HIM
5239-31629-0034 TAYLOR MANAGED TO PUSH THE CAPTAIN ON TO A HATCH THAT HAD FLOATED OFF FROM US AND THEN THEY SWAM BACK TO THE SHIP FOR MORE ASSISTANCE BUT NOTHING COULD BE DONE FOR THE CAPTAIN
5239-31629-0035 THERE WERE BURNING MEN AND SOME WOMEN AND TWO OR THREE CHILDREN LYING AROUND THE DECK NOT JUST BURNED BUT BURNING THEN WHEN WE GOT TO THEM MORE THAN HALF THE SHIP'S COMPANY HAD BEEN KILLED IN THAT FIRST RUSH OF FLAME
5239-31629-0036 SOME HAD ROLLED OVERBOARD WHEN THE TIDAL WAVE CAME AND WE NEVER SAW SO MUCH AS THEIR BODIES THE COOK WAS BURNED TO DEATH IN HIS GALLEY HE HAD BEEN PARING POTATOES FOR DINNER AND WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS RIGHT HAND HELD THE SHANK OF HIS POTATO KNIFE
5239-31629-0037 BELOW DECKS THERE WERE SOME TWENTY ALIVE THE SHIP WAS ON FIRE OF COURSE WHAT WAS LEFT OF IT THE STUMPS OF BOTH MASTS WERE BLAZING AFT SHE WAS LIKE A FURNACE BUT FORWARD THE FLAMES HAD NOT GOT BELOW DECK
5239-31629-0038 ONE BOY A PASSENGER AND JUST A LITTLE SHAVER THE FOUR YEAR OLD SON OF THE LATE CLEMENT STOKES ABOVE SPOKEN OF WAS PICKED UP NAKED HIS HAIR AND ALL HIS CLOTHING HAD BEEN BURNED OFF BUT HE WAS ALIVE WE ROLLED HIM IN A BLANKET AND PUT HIM IN A SAILOR'S BUNK
5239-31629-0039 A FEW MINUTES LATER WE LOOKED AT HIM AND HE WAS DEAD MY OWN SON'S GONE TOO
5239-31629-0040 SO I SUPPOSED AT FIRST WHEN THE FIRE STRUCK US THAT HE WAS ASLEEP IN HIS BUNK AND SAFE BUT HE WASN'T NOBODY COULD TELL ME WHERE HE WAS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE WAS BURNED TO DEATH OR ROLLED OVERBOARD AND DROWNED
5239-31629-0041 THE FOUR OF US THAT WERE LEFT HALF WAY SHIP SHAPE STARTED IN TO FIGHT THE FIRE
5239-31629-0042 THANKS TO THAT TIDAL WAVE THAT CLEARED OUR DECKS THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO BURN SO WE GOT THE FIRE DOWN SO'S WE COULD LIVE ON BOARD WITH IT FOR SEVERAL HOURS MORE AND THEN THE FOUR TURNED TO TO KNOCK A RAFT TOGETHER OUT OF WHAT TIMBER AND TRUCK WE COULD FIND BELOW
5239-31629-0043 THE SUCHET CAME ALONG AND TOOK US ALL OFF WE THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE JUST AFTER WE WERE WRECKED THAT WE WERE TO GET HELP FROM A SHIP THAT PASSED US WE BURNED BLUE LIGHTS BUT SHE KEPT ON WE LEARNED AFTERWARD THAT SHE WAS THE RODDAM
5239-31629-0044 WHILE DEEP CREVICES HAD BEEN FORMED ON THE LAND A STILL GREATER EFFECT HAD SEEMINGLY BEEN PRODUCED BENEATH THE WATER
5239-31629-0045 THIS INDICATING A LIFT AND FALL OF THE OCEAN BED OFF THE ISLE
5239-31629-0046 FOUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CARIBBEAN SEA SO CHANGED AS TO RENDER THE OLD CHARTS USELESS
5239-31629-0047 BUT EXTENDED AS FAR NORTH AS PORTO RICO AND IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE SEISMIC WAVE WOULD BE FOUND TO HAVE ALTERED THE OCEAN BED ROUND JAMAICA
5239-31629-0048 SOUNDINGS SHOWED SEVEN FATHOMS WHERE BEFORE THE ERUPTION THERE WERE THIRTY SIX FATHOMS OF WATER
5239-31629-0049 THE FOLLOWING IS THE STORY TOLD BY CAPTAIN ERIC LILLIEN SKJOLD THE STRANGE EXPERIENCE OF THE NORDBY ON MAY FIFTH THE CAPTAIN SAID WE TOUCHED AT SAINT MICHAEL'S FOR WATER
5239-31629-0050 WE LEFT SAINT MICHAEL'S ON THE SAME DAY NOTHING WORTH WHILE TALKING ABOUT OCCURRED UNTIL TWO DAYS AFTERWARD WEDNESDAY MAY SEVENTH WE WERE PLODDING ALONG SLOWLY THAT DAY ABOUT NOON I TOOK THE BRIDGE TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION
5239-31629-0051 IT SEEMED TO BE HOTTER THAN ORDINARY I SHED MY COAT AND VEST AND GOT INTO WHAT LITTLE SHADE THERE WAS AS I WORKED IT GREW HOTTER AND HOTTER I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
5239-31629-0052 ALONG ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS SO HOT THAT ALL HANDS GOT TO TALKING ABOUT IT WE RECKONED THAT SOMETHING QUEER WAS COMING OFF BUT NONE OF US COULD EXPLAIN WHAT IT WAS YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE PITCH SOFTENING IN THE SEAMS
5239-31629-0053 THEN AS QUICK AS YOU COULD TOSS A BISCUIT OVER ITS RAIL THE NORDBY DROPPED REGULARLY DROPPED THREE OR FOUR FEET DOWN INTO THE SEA NO SOONER DID IT DO THIS THAN BIG WAVES THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE COMING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE BEGAN TO SMASH AGAINST OUR SIDES
5239-31629-0054 I HAD ALL HANDS PIPED ON DECK AND WE BATTENED DOWN EVERYTHING LOOSE TO MAKE READY FOR A STORM
5239-31629-0055 THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SUN THAT AFTERNOON
5239-31629-0056 ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE CAME A SHEET OF LIGHTNING THAT SHOWED UP THE WHOLE TUMBLING SEA FOR MILES AND MILES WE SORT OF DUCKED EXPECTING AN AWFUL CRASH OF THUNDER BUT IT DIDN'T COME THERE WAS NO SOUND EXCEPT THE BIG WAVES POUNDING AGAINST OUR SIDES THERE WASN'T A BREATH OF WIND
5239-31629-0057 WELL SIR AT THAT MINUTE THERE BEGAN THE MOST EXCITING TIME I'VE EVER BEEN THROUGH AND I'VE BEEN ON EVERY SEA ON THE MAP FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS EVERY SECOND THERE'D BE WAVES FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FEET HIGH BELTING US HEAD ON STERN ON AND BROADSIDE ALL AT ONCE WE COULD SEE THEM COMING
5239-31629-0058 A FLOCK OF THEM SQUAWKING AND CRYING MADE FOR OUR RIGGING AND PERCHED THERE THEY SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE SCARED TO DEATH BUT THE QUEEREST PART OF IT ALL WAS THE WATER ITSELF IT WAS HOT NOT SO HOT THAT OUR FEET COULD NOT STAND IT WHEN IT WASHED OVER THE DECK
5239-31629-0059 WELL THAT SORT OF THING WENT ON HOUR AFTER HOUR THE WAVES THE LIGHTNING THE HOT WATER AND THE SHARKS AND ALL THE REST OF THE ODD THINGS HAPPENING FRIGHTENED THE CREW OUT OF THEIR WITS
5239-31629-0060 MIGHTY STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN ON THE SEA BUT THIS TOPPED THEM ALL I KEPT TO THE BRIDGE ALL NIGHT
5239-31629-0061 AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ALL THE QUEER GOINGS ON STOPPED JUST THE WAY THEY BEGAN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE LAY TO UNTIL DAYLIGHT THEN WE TOOK OUR RECKONINGS AND STARTED OFF AGAIN WE WERE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILES OFF CAPE HENLOPEN
5239-31629-0062 NONE OF US WAS HURT AND THE OLD NORDBY HERSELF PULLED THROUGH ALL RIGHT BUT I'D SOONER STAY ASHORE THAN SEE WAVES WITHOUT WIND AND LIGHTNING WITHOUT THUNDER FIERY STREAM CONTAINED POISONOUS GASES
5239-31629-0063 CAREFUL INSPECTION SHOWED THAT THE FIERY STREAM WHICH SO COMPLETELY DESTROYED SAINT PIERRE MUST HAVE BEEN COMPOSED OF POISONOUS GASES
5239-31629-0064 IT IS BELIEVED THAT MONT PELEE THREW OFF A GREAT GASP OF SOME EXCEEDINGLY HEAVY AND NOXIOUS GAS SOMETHING AKIN TO FIREDAMP WHICH SETTLED UPON THE CITY AND RENDERED THE INHABITANTS INSENSIBLE THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY THE SHEET OF FLAME THAT SWEPT DOWN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
5239-31629-0065 THE DUMB ANIMALS WERE WISER THAN MAN AND EARLY TOOK WARNING OF THE STORM OF FIRE WHICH MONT PELEE WAS STORING UP TO HURL UPON THE ISLAND EVEN BEFORE THE MOUNTAIN BEGAN TO RUMBLE LATE IN APRIL LIVE STOCK BECAME UNEASY AND AT TIMES WERE ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE
5239-31629-0066 CATTLE LOWED IN THE NIGHT DOGS HOWLED AND SOUGHT THE COMPANY OF THEIR MASTERS AND WHEN DRIVEN FORTH THEY GAVE EVERY EVIDENCE OF FEAR WILD ANIMALS DISAPPEARED FROM THE VICINITY OF MONT PELEE EVEN THE SNAKES
5239-31629-0067 WHICH AT ORDINARY TIMES ARE FOUND IN GREAT NUMBERS NEAR THE VOLCANO CRAWLED AWAY BIRDS CEASED SINGING AND LEFT THE TREES THAT SHADED THE SIDES OF PELEE
5239-31629-0068 OF THE VILLAGES IN THE VICINITY OF SAINT PIERRE ONLY ONE ESCAPED THE OTHERS SUFFERING THE FATE OF THE CITY THE FORTUNATE ONE WAS LE CARBET ON THE SOUTH WHICH ESCAPED UNINJURED THE FLOOD OF LAVA STOPPING WHEN WITHIN TWO HUNDRED FEET OF THE TOWN
5239-31629-0069 A BEAUTIFUL SUMMER RESORT FREQUENTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE ISLAND DURING THE HOT SEASON AS A PLACE OF RECREATION ALSO ESCAPED IN THE HEIGHT OF THE SEASON SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHERED THERE
5239-31629-0070 THERE WERE BUT A FEW HUNDRED THOUGH LOCATED ON AN ELEVATION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE CRATER IT WAS BY GREAT GOOD FORTUNE SAVED
