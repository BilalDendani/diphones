5653-46266-0006 SHE LOOKED AROUND IN VAIN FOR THE BOYS WHO HAD PROMISED TO MEET HER HER ARMS WERE SO FULL OF BUNDLES AS SUBURBAN PASSENGERS USUALLY ARE THAT SHE COULD NOT HOLD UP HER LONG BROADCLOTH SKIRT

5653-46266-0008 ALTHOUGH IT WAS VIRGINIA DUDLEY'S AMBITION TO BE EXACTLY LIKE HER AUNT ALLISON SHE WANTED TO BE TALL AND SLENDER AND GROWN UP
5653-46266-0009 AND A LOVE OF FUN THAT MADE HER CHARMING TO EVERYBODY YOUNG AND OLD VIRGINIA LONGED FOR WAVY BROWN HAIR AND WHITE HANDS AND ESPECIALLY FOR A GRACEFUL EASY MANNER HER HAIR WAS SHORT AND BLACK AND HER COMPLEXION LIKE A GYPSY'S
5653-46266-0010 SHE HAD HARD BROWN LITTLE FISTS SHARP GRAY EYES THAT SEEMED TO SEE EVERYTHING AT ONCE AND A TONGUE THAT WAS ALWAYS GETTING HER INTO TROUBLE AS FOR THE EASE OF MANNER THAT MIGHT COME IN TIME
5653-46266-0011 BUT HER STATELY OLD GRANDMOTHER OFTEN SIGHED IN SECRET OVER VIRGINIA'S AWKWARDNESS SHE STUMBLED NOW AS SHE FOLLOWED THE YOUNG LADY INTO THE WAITING ROOM HER BIG PLUME COVERED HAT TIPPED OVER ONE EAR BUT SHE TOO

5653-46266-0017 THEY WERE TWO VERY DIRTY BOYS WHO CLATTERED UP THE BACK STAIRS AND RACED TO THEIR ROOM TO DRESS FOR DINNER THEIR CLOTHES WERE COVERED WITH HAYSEED AND STRAW AND THEIR HANDS AND FACES WERE BLACK WITH SOOT FROM THE OLD CABIN CHIMNEY THEY HAD BOTH HELPED TO BUILD THE FIRE
5653-46266-0018 THE LAMPS HAD JUST BEEN LIGHTED IN THE UPPER HALL AND VIRGINIA CAME RUNNING OUT FROM HER ROOM WHEN SHE HEARD THE BOYS VOICES WHY DIDN'T YOU MEET US AT THE TRAIN SHE BEGAN BUT STOPPED AS SHE SAW THEIR DIRTY FACES WHERE ON EARTH HAVE YOU CHIMNEY SWEEPS BEEN SHE CRIED
5653-46266-0019 DON'T YOU WISH YOU KNEW VIRGINIA SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AS IF SHE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST IN THE MATTER AND HELD OUT TWO PACKAGES
5653-46266-0020 YOU JUST OUGHT TO SEE THE PILE THAT AUNT ALLISON BOUGHT WE'VE THE BEST SECRET ABOUT TO MORROW THAT EVER WAS

5653-46266-0022 VIRGINIA WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO HER ROOM AND PAUSED IN THE DOORWAY WONDERING WHAT SHE COULD DO TO AMUSE HERSELF UNTIL DINNER TIME IT WAS A QUEER ROOM FOR A GIRL
5653-46266-0023 DECORATED WITH FLAGS AND INDIAN TROPHIES AND EVERYTHING THAT COULD REMIND HER OF THE MILITARY LIFE SHE LOVED AT THE FAR AWAY ARMY POST THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS FRAMED IN BRASS BUTTONS ON HER DRESSING TABLE
5653-46266-0024 AND PICTURES OF UNIFORMED OFFICERS ALL OVER THE WALLS A CANTEEN AND AN ARMY CAP WITH A BULLET HOLE THROUGH THE CROWN HUNG OVER HER DESK AND A BATTERED BUGLE THAT HAD SOUNDED MANY A TRIUMPHANT CHARGE SWUNG FROM THE CORNER OF HER MIRROR
5653-46266-0025 EACH SOUVENIR HAD A HISTORY AND HAD BEEN GIVEN HER AT PARTING BY SOME SPECIAL FRIEND EVERY ONE AT THE FORT HAD MADE A PET OF CAPTAIN DUDLEY'S DAUGHTER
5653-46266-0026 THE HARUM SCARUM LITTLE GINGER WHO WOULD RATHER DASH ACROSS THE PRAIRIES ON HER PONY LIKE A WILD COMANCHE INDIAN THAN PLAY WITH THE FINEST DOLL EVER IMPORTED FROM PARIS THERE WAS A SUIT IN HER WARDROBE SHORT SKIRT JACKET LEGGINS AND MOCCASINS
5653-46266-0027 ALL MADE AND BEADED BY THE SQUAWS IT WAS THE GIFT OF THE COLONEL'S WIFE MISSUS DUDLEY HAD HESITATED SOME TIME BEFORE PUTTING IT IN ONE OF THE TRUNKS THAT WAS TO GO BACK TO KENTUCKY YOU LOOK SO MUCH LIKE AN INDIAN NOW SHE SAID TO VIRGINIA
5653-46266-0028 YOUR FACE IS SO SUNBURNED THAT I AM AFRAID YOUR GRANDMOTHER WILL BE SCANDALISED I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD SAY IF SHE KNEW THAT I EVER ALLOWED YOU TO RUN SO WILD IF I HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WERE GOING BACK TO CIVILISATION I CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT HAVE KEPT YOUR HAIR CUT SHORT
5653-46266-0029 AND YOU SHOULD HAVE WORN SUNBONNETS ALL SUMMER TO MISSUS DUDLEY'S GREAT SURPRISE HER LITTLE DAUGHTER THREW HERSELF INTO HER ARMS SOBBING
5653-46266-0030 TAKE ME TO CUBA WITH YOU PLEASE DO OR ELSE LET ME STAY HERE AT THE POST EVERYBODY WILL TAKE CARE OF ME HERE I'LL JUST DIE IF YOU LEAVE ME IN KENTUCKY WHY DARLING
5653-46266-0031 SHE SAID SOOTHINGLY AS SHE WIPED HER TEARS AWAY AND ROCKED HER BACK AND FORTH IN HER ARMS I THOUGHT YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE MAMMA'S OLD HOME AND THE PLACES YOU HAVE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THERE ARE ALL THE OLD TOYS IN THE NURSERY THAT WE HAD WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN
5653-46266-0032 AND THE GRAPE VINE SWING IN THE ORCHARD AND THE MILL STREAM WHERE WE FISHED AND THE BEECH WOODS WHERE WE HAD SUCH DELIGHTFUL PICNICS
5653-46266-0033 AND KNOW ALL THE DEAR OLD NEIGHBOURS THAT I KNEW WOULDN'T MY LITTLE GIRL LIKE THAT OH YES SOME I S'POSE SOBBED VIRGINIA BUT I DIDN'T KNOW I'D HAVE TO BE SO SO EVERLASTINGLY CIVILISED SHE WAILED
5653-46266-0034 I DON'T WANT TO ALWAYS HAVE TO DRESS JUST SO AND HAVE TO WALK IN A PATH AND BE CALLED VIRGINIA ALL THE TIME THAT SOUNDS SO STIFF AND PROPER I'D RATHER STAY WHERE PEOPLE DON'T MIND IF I AM SUNBURNED AND TANNED AND WON'T BE SCANDALISED AT EVERYTHING I DO
5653-46266-0035 IT'S SO MUCH NICER TO BE JUST PLAIN GINGER IT HAD BEEN FIVE MONTHS NOW SINCE VIRGINIA LEFT FORT DENNIS AT FIRST SHE HAD LOCKED HEN SELF IN HER ROOM NEARLY EVERY DAY AND WITH HER FACE BURIED IN HER INDIAN SUIT CRIED TO GO BACK
5653-46266-0036 SHE MISSED THE GAY MILITARY LIFE OF THE ARMY POST AS A SAILOR WOULD MISS THE SEA OR AN ALPINE SHEPHERD THE FREE AIR OF HIS SNOW CAPPED MOUNTAIN HEIGHTS IT WAS NOT THAT SHE DID NOT ENJOY BEING AT HER GRANDMOTHER'S
5653-46266-0037 SHE LIKED THE GREAT GRAY HOUSE WHOSE SQUARE CORNER TOWER AND OVER HANGING VINES MADE IT LOOK LIKE AN OLD CASTLE SHE LIKED THE COMFORT AND ELEGANCE OF THE BIG STATELY ROOMS
5653-46266-0038 THE NEGRO SERVANTS SEEMED SO QUEER AND FUNNY TO HER THAT SHE FOUND THEM A GREAT SOURCE OF AMUSEMENT AND HER AUNT ALLISON PLANNED SO MANY PLEASANT OCCUPATIONS OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL HOURS THAT SHE SCARCELY HAD TIME TO GET LONESOME BUT SHE HAD A SHUT IN FEELING
5653-46266-0039 LIKE A WILD BIRD IN A CAGE AND SOMETIMES THE LONGING FOR LIBERTY WHICH HER MOTHER HAD ALLOWED HER MADE HER FRET AGAINST THE THOUSAND LITTLE PROPRIETIES SHE HAD TO OBSERVE SOMETIMES WHEN SHE WENT TIPPING OVER THE POLISHED FLOORS OF THE LONG DRAWING ROOM AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF HERSELF IN ONE OF THE BIG MIRRORS
5653-46266-0040 SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS NOT HERSELF AT ALL BUT SOMEBODY IN A STORY THE VIRGINIA IN THE LOOKING GLASS SEEMED SO VERY VERY CIVILISED MORE THAN ONCE AFTER ONE OF THESE MEETINGS WITH HERSELF IN THE MIRROR SHE DASHED UP STAIRS LOCKED HER DOOR
5653-46266-0041 THEN IN HER NOISELESS MOCCASINS SHE DANCED THE WILDEST OF WAR DANCES WHISPERING SHRILLY BETWEEN HER TEETH NOW I'M GINGER NOW I'M GINGER AND I WON'T BE DRESSED UP AND I WON'T LEARN MY LESSONS AND I WON'T BE A LITTLE LADY
5653-46266-0042 AND I'LL RUN AWAY AND GO BACK TO FORT DENNIS THE VERY FIRST CHANCE I GET USUALLY SHE WAS ASHAMED OF THESE OUTBURSTS AFTERWARDS FOR IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT AFTER EACH ONE SHE FOUND HER AUNT ALLISON HAD PLANNED SOMETHING ESPECIALLY PLEASANT FOR HER ENTERTAINMENT
5653-46266-0043 MISS ALLISON FELT SORRY FOR THE LONELY CHILD WHO HAD NEVER BEEN SEPARATED FROM HER FATHER AND MOTHER BEFORE SO SHE DEVOTED HER TIME TO HER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TELLING HER STORIES AND ENTERING INTO HER PLAYS AND PLEASURES AS IF THEY HAD BOTH BEEN THE SAME AGE
5653-46266-0044 SINCE THE BOYS HAD COME VIRGINIA HAD NOT HAD A SINGLE HOMESICK MOMENT WHILE SHE WAS AT SCHOOL IN THE PRIMARY DEPARTMENT OF THE GIRLS COLLEGE
5653-46266-0045 THEY WERE ALL FREE ABOUT THE SAME HOUR AND EVEN ON THE COLDEST DAYS PLAYED OUT OF DOORS FROM LUNCH TIME UNTIL DARK TO NIGHT VIRGINIA HAD SO MANY EXPERIENCES TO TELL THEM OF HER DAY IN TOWN THAT THE BOYS SEEMED UNUSUALLY LONG IN DRESSING
5653-46266-0046 SHE WAS SO IMPATIENT FOR THEM TO HEAR HER NEWS THAT SHE COULD NOT SETTLE DOWN TO ANYTHING BUT WALKED RESTLESSLY AROUND THE ROOM WISHING THEY WOULD HURRY OH I HAVEN'T SORTED MY VALENTINES
5653-46266-0047 SHE EXCLAIMED PRESENTLY PICKING UP A FANCY BOX WHICH SHE HAD TOSSED ON THE BED WHEN SHE FIRST CAME IN
5653-46266-0048 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE ROOM WHEN SHE PEEPED IN IT LOOKED SO BRIGHT AND COSY WITH THE GREAT WOOD FIRE BLAZING ON THE HEARTH AND THE ROSE COLOURED LIGHT FALLING FROM ITS SOFTLY SHADED LAMPS THAT SHE FORGOT THE COLDNESS OF THE NIGHT OUTSIDE SITTING DOWN ON A PILE OF CUSHIONS AT ONE END OF THE HEARTH RUG
5653-46266-0049 SHE BEGAN SORTING HER PURCHASES TRYING TO DECIDE TO WHOM EACH ONE SHOULD BE SENT THE PRETTIEST VALENTINE OF ALL MUST GO TO POOR PAPA SHE SAID TO HERSELF CAUSE HE'S BEEN SO SICK AWAY DOWN THERE IN CUBA
5653-46266-0050 AND THIS ONE THAT'S GOT THE LITTLE GIRL ON IT IN A BLUE DRESS SHALL BE FOR MY DEAR SWEET MAMMA CAUSE IT WILL MAKE HER THINK OF ME FOR A MOMENT A MIST SEEMED TO BLUR THE GAY BLUE DRESS OF THE LITTLE VALENTINE GIRL AS VIRGINIA LOOKED AT HER THINKING OF HER FAR AWAY MOTHER
5653-46266-0051 SHE DREW HER HAND HASTILY ACROSS HER EYES AND WENT ON THIS ONE IS FOR SERGEANT JACKSON OUT AT FORT DENNIS AND THE BIGGEST ONE WITH THE DOVES FOR COLONEL PHILIPS AND HIS WIFE DEAR ME I WISH I COULD SEND ONE TO EVERY OFFICER AND SOLDIER OUT THERE
5653-46266-0052 THEY WERE ALL SO GOOD TO ME THE PILE OF LACE PAPER CUPIDS AND HEARTS AND ARROWS AND ROSES SLIPPED FROM HER LAP DOWN TO THE RUG AS SHE CLASPED HER HANDS AROUND HER KNEES AND LOOKED INTO THE FIRE SHE WISHED THAT SHE COULD BE BACK AGAIN AT THE FORT
5653-46266-0053 HOW SHE LOVED THE BUGLE CALLS AND THE WILD THRILL THE BAND GAVE HER WHEN IT STRUCK UP A BURST OF MARTIAL MUSIC AND THE TROOPS WENT DASHING BY HOW SHE MISSED THE DRILLS AND THE DRESS PARADES HER RIDES ACROSS THE OPEN PRAIRIE ON HER PONY BESIDE HER FATHER
5653-46266-0054 HOW SHE MISSED THE GAMES SHE USED TO PLAY WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN AT THE FORT ON THE LONG SUMMER EVENINGS SOMETHING MORE THAN A MIST WAS GATHERING IN HER EYES NOW TWO BIG TEARS WERE ALMOST READY TO FALL WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND MISSUS MAC INTYRE CAME IN
5653-46266-0055 IN VIRGINIA'S EYES SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GRANDMOTHER ANY ONE EVER HAD SHE WAS NOT SO TALL AS HER DAUGHTER ALLISON AND IN THAT RESPECT FELL SHORT OF THE LITTLE GIRL'S IDEAL BUT HER HAIR WHITE AS SNOW
5653-46266-0056 CURLED AROUND HER FACE IN THE SAME SOFT PRETTY FASHION AND BY EVERY REFINED FEATURE SHE SHOWED HER KINSHIP TO THE ARISTOCRATIC OLD FACES WHICH LOOKED DOWN FROM THE FAMILY PORTRAITS IN THE HALL
5653-46266-0057 AS SHE DID SO HER HEEL CAUGHT IN THE RUG AND SHE FELL BACK IN AN AWKWARD LITTLE HEAP THE MORE HASTE THE LESS GRACE MY DEAR SAID HER GRANDMOTHER KINDLY THANKING HER FOR THE PROFFERED CHAIR VIRGINIA BLUSHED
5653-46266-0058 WONDERING WHY SHE ALWAYS APPEARED SO AWKWARD IN HER GRANDMOTHER'S PRESENCE SHE ENVIED THE BOYS BECAUSE THEY NEVER SEEMED EMBARRASSED OR ILL AT EASE BEFORE HER WHILE SHE WAS PICKING UP HER VALENTINES THE BOYS CAME IN IF TWO OF THE CAVALIER ANCESTORS HAD STEPPED DOWN FROM THEIR PORTRAIT FRAMES JUST THEN
5653-46266-0059 THEY COULD NOT HAVE COME INTO THE ROOM IN A MORE CHARMING MANNER THAN MALCOLM AND KEITH THEIR FACES WERE SHINING THEIR LINEN SPOTLESS AND THEY CAME UP TO KISS THEIR GRANDMOTHER'S CHEEK WITH AN OLD TIME COURTLINESS THAT DELIGHTED HER
5653-46266-0060 I AM SURE THAT THERE ARE NO MORE PERFECT GENTLEMEN IN ALL KENTUCKY THAN MY TWO LITTLE LADS SHE SAID FONDLY WITH AN APPROVING PAT OF KEITH'S HAND AS SHE HELD HIM A MOMENT VIRGINIA WHO HAD SEEN THEM HALF AN HOUR BEFORE
5653-46266-0061 TOUSLED AND DIRTY AND HAD BEEN ARRAYED AGAINST THEM IN MORE THAN ONE HOT QUARREL WHERE THEY HAD BEEN ANYTHING BUT CHIVALROUS LET SLIP A FAINTLY WHISTLED CUCKOO THE BOYS DARTED A QUICK GLANCE IN HER DIRECTION BUT SHE WAS BENDING OVER THE VALENTINES WITH A VERY SERIOUS FACE
5653-46266-0062 WHICH NEVER CHANGED ITS EXPRESSION TILL HER AUNT ALLISON CAME IN AND THE BOYS BEGAN THEIR APOLOGIES FOR NOT MEETING HER AT THE TRAIN THEIR ONLY EXCUSE WAS THAT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT VIRGINIA SPELLED ON HER FINGERS
5653-46266-0063 I DARE YOU TO TELL WHAT MADE YOUR FACES SO BLACK KEITH'S ONLY ANSWER WAS TO THRUST HIS TONGUE OUT AT HER BEHIND HIS GRANDMOTHER'S BACK THEN HE RAN TO HOLD THE DOOR OPEN FOR THE LADIES TO PASS OUT TO DINNER WITH ALL THE GRACE OF A YOUNG CHESTERFIELD
5653-46266-0064 MISS ALLISON OPENED A BOX OF TINY HEART SHAPED ENVELOPES AND BEGAN ADDRESSING THEM AS SHE TOOK UP HER PEN SHE SAID MERRILY NOW YOU MAY TELL OUR SECRET VIRGINIA I WAS GOING TO MAKE YOU GUESS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR SAID VIRGINIA
