1773-145716-0000 AS SOON AS THE BIRD APPEARED HIGH ABOVE THEIR HEADS SLEEP OVERPOWERED THEM AND THEY ONLY AWOKE TO HEAR THE WINDOWS CRASHING IN
1773-145716-0001 HE PLACED A LOT OF THORNS UNDER HIS CHIN SO THAT IF HE FELT DROWSY AND NODDED HIS HEAD THEY WOULD PRICK HIM AND KEEP HIM AWAKE
1773-145716-0002 AND IT WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD A FEARFUL NOISE AND AT THE SAME TIME A TERRIBLE DESIRE TO SLEEP OVERPOWERED HIM HIS EYELIDS CLOSED AND HIS HEAD SANK ON HIS SHOULDERS
1773-145716-0003 AND WERE SO PAINFUL THAT HE AWOKE AT ONCE HE SAW THE HAWK SWOOPING DOWN UPON THE CHURCH AND IN A MOMENT HE HAD SEIZED HIS GUN AND SHOT AT THE BIRD THE HAWK FELL HEAVILY UNDER A BIG STONE
1773-145716-0004 DRAGGED A LOT OF PINE WOOD AND ROPES TO THE SPOT THEY FASTENED SOME OF THE BURNING PINE WOOD TO THE END OF THE ROPE AND LET IT SLOWLY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS AT FIRST IT WAS QUITE DARK
1773-145716-0005 AND THE FLAMING TORCH ONLY LIT UP DIRTY GREY STONE WALLS BUT THE YOUNGEST BROTHER DETERMINED TO EXPLORE THE ABYSS AND LETTING HIMSELF DOWN BY THE ROPE HE SOON REACHED THE BOTTOM HERE HE FOUND A LOVELY MEADOW
1773-145716-0006 FULL OF GREEN TREES AND EXQUISITE FLOWERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEADOW STOOD A HUGE STONE CASTLE WITH AN IRON GATE LEADING TO IT WHICH WAS WIDE OPEN EVERYTHING IN THE CASTLE SEEMED TO BE MADE OF COPPER
1773-145716-0007 AND THE ONLY INHABITANT HE COULD DISCOVER WAS A LOVELY GIRL WHO WAS COMBING HER GOLDEN HAIR
1773-145716-0008 LIKE PURE METAL THE YOUTH LOOKED AT HER MORE CLOSELY AND SAW THAT HER SKIN WAS SMOOTH AND FAIR HER BLUE EYES BRIGHT AND SPARKLING AND HER HAIR AS GOLDEN AS THE SUN HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER ON THE SPOT
1773-145716-0009 AND KNEELING AT HER FEET HE IMPLORED HER TO BECOME HIS WIFE THE LOVELY GIRL ACCEPTED HIS PROPOSAL GLADLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE WARNED HIM THAT SHE COULD NEVER COME UP TO THE WORLD ABOVE
1773-145716-0010 WAS DEAD AND SHE WENT ON TO TELL HIM THAT THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH THE OLD CREATURE COULD BE KILLED
1773-145716-0011 BUT THE SWORD WAS SO HEAVY THAT NO ONE COULD LIFT IT THEN THE YOUTH WENT INTO A ROOM IN THE CASTLE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS MADE OF SILVER AND HERE HE FOUND ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE SISTER OF HIS BRIDE
1773-145716-0012 SHE WAS COMBING HER SILVER HAIR
1773-145716-0013 THE SECOND GIRL HANDED HIM THE SWORD BUT THOUGH HE TRIED WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH HE COULD NOT LIFT IT AT LAST A THIRD SISTER CAME TO HIM AND GAVE HIM A DROP OF SOMETHING TO DRINK
1773-145716-0014 WHICH SHE SAID WOULD GIVE HIM THE NEEDFUL STRENGTH HE DRANK ONE DROP
1773-145716-0015 THEN HE DRANK A SECOND AND THE SWORD BEGAN TO MOVE BUT ONLY AFTER HE HAD DRUNK A THIRD DROP WAS HE ABLE TO SWING THE SWORD OVER HIS HEAD THEN HE HID HIMSELF IN THE CASTLE
1773-145716-0016 AND AWAITED THE OLD WITCH'S ARRIVAL AT LAST AS IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW DARK SHE APPEARED SHE SWOOPED DOWN UPON A BIG APPLE TREE
1773-145716-0017 SHE POUNCED DOWN UPON THE EARTH AS SOON AS HER FEET TOUCHED THE GROUND SHE BECAME TRANSFORMED FROM A HAWK INTO A WOMAN
1773-145716-0018 FIRST THE TREASURES WERE ATTACHED TO THE ROPE AND THEN THE THREE LOVELY GIRLS AND NOW EVERYTHING WAS UP ABOVE AND ONLY HE HIMSELF REMAINED BELOW
1773-145716-0019 BUT AS HE WAS A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS OF HIS BROTHERS HE FASTENED A HEAVY STONE ON TO THE ROPE AND LET THEM PULL IT UP AT FIRST THEY HEAVED WITH A WILL BUT WHEN THE STONE WAS HALF WAY UP THEY LET IT DROP SUDDENLY
1773-145716-0020 AND IT FELL TO THE BOTTOM BROKEN INTO A HUNDRED PIECES SO THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO MY BONES HAD I TRUSTED MYSELF TO THEM SAID THE YOUTH SADLY AND HE BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
1773-145716-0021 NOT BECAUSE OF THE TREASURES BUT BECAUSE OF THE LOVELY GIRL WITH HER SWANLIKE NECK AND GOLDEN HAIR FOR A LONG TIME HE WANDERED SADLY ALL THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL UNDERWORLD AND ONE DAY
1773-145716-0022 HE MET A MAGICIAN WHO ASKED HIM THE CAUSE OF HIS TEARS THE YOUTH TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND THE MAGICIAN SAID DO NOT GRIEVE YOUNG MAN IF YOU WILL GUARD THE CHILDREN WHO ARE HIDDEN IN THE GOLDEN APPLE TREE
1773-145716-0023 I WILL BRING YOU AT ONCE UP TO THE EARTH ANOTHER MAGICIAN WHO LIVES IN THIS LAND ALWAYS EATS MY CHILDREN UP IT IS IN VAIN THAT I HAVE HIDDEN THEM UNDER THE EARTH AND LOCKED THEM INTO THE CASTLE
1773-145716-0024 NOW I HAVE HIDDEN THEM IN THE APPLE TREE HIDE YOURSELF THERE TOO AND AT MIDNIGHT YOU WILL SEE MY ENEMY THE YOUTH CLIMBED UP THE TREE AND PICKED SOME OF THE BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN APPLES WHICH HE ATE FOR HIS SUPPER
1773-145716-0025 AT MIDNIGHT THE WIND BEGAN TO RISE AND A RUSTLING SOUND WAS HEARD AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE THE YOUTH LOOKED DOWN AND BEHELD A LONG THICK SERPENT BEGINNING TO CRAWL UP THE TREE
1773-145716-0026 AND GRADUALLY GOT HIGHER AND HIGHER IT STRETCHED ITS HUGE HEAD IN WHICH THE EYES GLITTERED FIERCELY AMONG THE BRANCHES SEARCHING FOR THE NEST IN WHICH THE LITTLE CHILDREN LAY
1773-145716-0027 THEY TREMBLED WITH TERROR WHEN THEY SAW THE HIDEOUS CREATURE AND HID THEMSELVES BENEATH THE LEAVES
1773-145716-0028 SWUNG HIS MIGHTY SWORD IN THE AIR AND WITH ONE BLOW CUT OFF THE SERPENT'S HEAD HE CUT UP THE REST OF THE BODY INTO LITTLE BITS AND STREWED THEM TO THE FOUR WINDS
1773-145716-0029 UP TO THE WORLD ABOVE WITH WHAT JOY DID HE HURRY NOW TO HIS BROTHERS HOUSE
1773-145716-0030 BUT NO ONE KNEW WHO HE WAS ONLY HIS BRIDE WHO WAS SERVING AS COOK TO HER SISTERS RECOGNISED HER LOVER AT ONCE HIS BROTHERS WHO HAD QUITE BELIEVED HE WAS DEAD
