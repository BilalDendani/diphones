7762-280917-0000 THE CHAMPAGNE SERVED AS A RESOURCE AND HIS EXCELLENCY TOO WAS PLEASED THAT HE HAD FILLED HIS GLASS NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHAMPAGNE FOR IT WAS WARM AND PERFECTLY ABOMINABLE BUT JUST MORALLY PLEASED
7762-280917-0001 BUT HE DOESN'T VENTURE TILL I DO I MUSTN'T PREVENT HIM AND INDEED IT WOULD BE ABSURD FOR THE BOTTLE TO STAND BETWEEN AS UNTOUCHED HE TOOK A SIP ANYWAY IT SEEMED BETTER THAN SITTING DOING NOTHING
7762-280917-0002 I AM HERE HE SAID WITH PAUSES AND EMPHASIS I AM HERE YOU KNOW SO TO SPEAK ACCIDENTALLY AND OF COURSE IT MAY BE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER IT UNSEEMLY FOR ME TO BE AT SUCH A GATHERING
7762-280917-0003 AKIM PETROVITCH SAID NOTHING BUT LISTENED WITH TIMID CURIOSITY BUT I HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WITH WHAT OBJECT I HAVE COME
7762-280917-0004 AKIM PETROVITCH TRIED TO CHUCKLE FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF HIS EXCELLENCY BUT AGAIN HE COULD NOT GET IT OUT AND AGAIN HE MADE ABSOLUTELY NO CONSOLATORY ANSWER I AM HERE
7762-280917-0005 TO SHOW SO TO SPEAK A MORAL AIM
7762-280917-0006 FEELING VEXED AT AKIM PETROVITCH'S STUPIDITY BUT HE SUDDENLY SUBSIDED INTO SILENCE HIMSELF HE SAW THAT POOR AKIM PETROVITCH HAD DROPPED HIS EYES AS THOUGH HE WERE IN FAULT
7762-280917-0007 THE GENERAL IN SOME CONFUSION MADE HASTE TO TAKE ANOTHER SIP FROM HIS GLASS AND AKIM PETROVITCH CLUTCHED AT THE BOTTLE AS THOUGH IT WERE HIS ONLY HOPE OF SALVATION AND FILLED THE GLASS AGAIN
7762-280917-0008 THE LATTER FEELING THAT STERN GENERAL LIKE EYE UPON HIM MADE UP HIS MIND TO REMAIN SILENT FOR GOOD AND NOT TO RAISE HIS EYES SO THEY SAT BESIDE EACH OTHER FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES
7762-280917-0009 TWO SICKLY MINUTES FOR AKIM PETROVITCH A COUPLE OF WORDS ABOUT AKIM PETROVITCH HE WAS A MAN OF THE OLD SCHOOL AS MEEK AS A HEN REARED FROM INFANCY TO OBSEQUIOUS SERVILITY
7762-280917-0010 AND AT THE SAME TIME A GOOD NATURED AND EVEN HONOURABLE MAN HE WAS A PETERSBURG RUSSIAN THAT IS HIS FATHER AND HIS FATHER'S FATHER WERE BORN GREW UP AND SERVED IN PETERSBURG AND HAD NEVER ONCE LEFT PETERSBURG
7762-280917-0011 THAT IS QUITE A SPECIAL TYPE OF RUSSIAN THEY HAVE HARDLY ANY IDEA OF RUSSIA THOUGH THAT DOES NOT TROUBLE THEM AT ALL THEIR WHOLE INTEREST IS CONFINED TO PETERSBURG AND CHIEFLY THE PLACE IN WHICH THEY SERVE
7762-280917-0012 AND THEIR MONTH'S SALARY THEY DON'T KNOW A SINGLE RUSSIAN CUSTOM A SINGLE RUSSIAN SONG EXCEPT LUTCHINUSHKA AND THAT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS PLAYED ON THE BARREL ORGANS
7762-280917-0013 HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL AND INVARIABLE SIGNS BY WHICH YOU CAN AT ONCE DISTINGUISH A PETERSBURG RUSSIAN FROM A REAL RUSSIAN THE FIRST SIGN IS THE FACT THAT PETERSBURG RUSSIANS
7762-280917-0014 ALL WITHOUT EXCEPTION SPEAK OF THE NEWSPAPER AS THE ACADEMIC NEWS AND NEVER CALL IT THE PETERSBURG NEWS THE SECOND AND EQUALLY TRUSTWORTHY SIGN
7762-280917-0015 IS THAT PETERSBURG RUSSIANS NEVER MAKE USE OF THE WORD BREAKFAST BUT ALWAYS CALL IT FRUHSTUCK WITH ESPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE FIRST SYLLABLE BY THESE RADICAL AND DISTINGUISHING SIGNS YOU CAN TELL THEM APART IN SHORT THIS IS A HUMBLE TYPE
7762-280917-0016 WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED DURING THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS AKIM PETROVITCH HOWEVER WAS BY NO MEANS A FOOL IF THE GENERAL HAD ASKED HIM A QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS OWN PROVINCE HE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED AND KEPT UP A CONVERSATION
7762-280917-0017 AS IT WAS IT WAS UNSEEMLY FOR A SUBORDINATE EVEN TO ANSWER SUCH QUESTIONS AS THESE THOUGH AKIM PETROVITCH WAS DYING FROM CURIOSITY TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE DETAILED ABOUT HIS EXCELLENCY'S REAL INTENTIONS
7762-280917-0018 IN HIS ABSORPTION HE SIPPED HIS GLASS EVERY HALF MINUTE AKIM PETROVITCH AT ONCE ZEALOUSLY FILLED IT UP BOTH WERE SILENT
7762-280917-0019 ONE CIRCUMSTANCE EVEN SURPRISED HIM THE DANCES WERE CERTAINLY LIVELY HERE PEOPLE DANCED IN THE SIMPLICITY OF THEIR HEARTS TO AMUSE THEMSELVES AND EVEN TO ROMP WILDLY
7762-280917-0020 AMONG THE DANCERS FEW WERE REALLY SKILFUL BUT THE UNSKILLED STAMPED SO VIGOROUSLY THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR AGILE ONES THE OFFICER WAS AMONG THE FOREMOST
7762-280917-0021 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE FIGURES IN WHICH HE WAS LEFT ALONE TO PERFORM A SOLO THEN HE PERFORMED THE MOST MARVELLOUS CAPERS FOR INSTANCE STANDING UPRIGHT AS A POST HE WOULD SUDDENLY BEND OVER TO ONE SIDE
7762-280917-0022 SO THAT ONE EXPECTED HIM TO FALL OVER BUT WITH THE NEXT STEP HE WOULD SUDDENLY BEND OVER IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AT THE SAME ACUTE ANGLE TO THE FLOOR HE KEPT THE MOST SERIOUS FACE AND DANCED IN THE FULL CONVICTION
7762-280917-0023 THAT EVERY ONE WAS WATCHING HIM ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WHO HAD HAD RATHER MORE THAN HE COULD CARRY BEFORE THE QUADRILLE DROPPED ASLEEP BESIDE HIS PARTNER SO THAT HIS PARTNER HAD TO DANCE ALONE
7762-280917-0024 THE YOUNG REGISTRATION CLERK WHO HAD DANCED WITH THE LADY IN THE BLUE SCARF THROUGH ALL THE FIGURES AND THROUGH ALL THE FIVE QUADRILLES WHICH THEY HAD DANCED THAT EVENING PLAYED THE SAME PRANK THE WHOLE TIME
7762-280917-0025 HIS PARTNER SAILED ALONG IN FRONT OF HIM AS THOUGH SHE NOTICED NOTHING THE MEDICAL STUDENT REALLY DID DANCE ON HIS HEAD AND EXCITED FRANTIC ENTHUSIASM STAMPING AND SHRIEKS OF DELIGHT IN SHORT THE ABSENCE OF CONSTRAINT WAS VERY MARKED
7762-280917-0026 BEGAN BY SMILING BUT BY DEGREES A BITTER DOUBT BEGAN TO STEAL INTO HIS HEART OF COURSE HE LIKED FREE AND EASY MANNERS AND UNCONVENTIONALITY
7762-280917-0027 HE DESIRED HE HAD EVEN INWARDLY PRAYED FOR FREE AND EASY MANNERS WHEN THEY HAD ALL HELD BACK
7762-280917-0028 BUT NOW THAT UNCONVENTIONALITY HAD GONE BEYOND ALL LIMITS ONE LADY FOR INSTANCE THE ONE IN THE SHABBY DARK BLUE VELVET DRESS BOUGHT FOURTH HAND IN THE SIXTH FIGURE PINNED HER DRESS SO AS TO TURN IT INTO SOMETHING LIKE TROUSERS
7762-280917-0029 WITH WHOM ONE COULD VENTURE TO DO ANYTHING AS HER PARTNER THE MEDICAL STUDENT HAD EXPRESSED IT THE MEDICAL STUDENT DEFIED DESCRIPTION HE WAS SIMPLY A FOKIN HOW WAS IT
7762-280917-0030 THEY HAD HELD BACK AND NOW THEY WERE SO QUICKLY EMANCIPATED ONE MIGHT THINK IT NOTHING BUT THIS TRANSFORMATION WAS SOMEHOW STRANGE IT INDICATED SOMETHING
7762-280917-0031 AKIM PETROVITCH CHUCKLED RESPECTFULLY IN UNISON THOUGH INDEED WITH EVIDENT PLEASURE AND NO SUSPICION THAT HIS EXCELLENCY WAS BEGINNING TO NOURISH IN HIS HEART A NEW GNAWING ANXIETY
7762-280917-0032 MADE A GRIMACE AND BRINGING HIS FACE CLOSE INTO UNSEEMLY PROXIMITY TO THE FACE OF HIS EXCELLENCY CROWED LIKE A COCK AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE THIS WAS TOO MUCH
7762-280917-0033 IN SPITE OF THAT A ROAR OF INEXPRESSIBLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED FOR THE CROW WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD IMITATION AND THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE WAS UTTERLY UNEXPECTED
7762-280917-0034 AND WITH A BOW BEGAN BEGGING HIM TO COME TO SUPPER HIS MOTHER FOLLOWED HIM YOUR EXCELLENCY SHE SAID BOWING DO US THE HONOUR DO NOT DISDAIN OUR HUMBLE FARE
7762-280917-0035 I DID NOT COME WITH THAT IDEA I MEANT TO BE GOING HE WAS IN FACT HOLDING HIS HAT IN HIS HANDS WHAT IS MORE HE HAD AT THAT VERY MOMENT TAKEN AN INWARD VOW
7762-280917-0036 A MINUTE LATER HE LED THE PROCESSION TO THE TABLE PSELDONIMOV AND HIS MOTHER WALKED IN FRONT CLEARING THE WAY FOR HIM THEY MADE HIM SIT DOWN IN THE SEAT OF HONOUR
7762-280917-0037 AND AGAIN A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE OPENED BUT NOT BEGUN WAS SET BESIDE HIS PLATE BY WAY OF HORS D'OEUVRES THERE WERE SALT HERRINGS AND VODKA HE PUT OUT HIS HAND POURED OUT A LARGE GLASS OF VODKA AND DRANK IT OFF
7762-280917-0038 HE HAD NEVER DRUNK VODKA BEFORE HE FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE ROLLING DOWN A HILL WERE FLYING FLYING FLYING THAT HE MUST STOP HIMSELF CATCH AT SOMETHING BUT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF IT HIS POSITION WAS CERTAINLY BECOMING MORE AND MORE ECCENTRIC
7762-280917-0039 GOD KNOWS WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR OR SO WHEN HE WENT IN HE HAD SO TO SAY OPENED HIS ARMS TO EMBRACE ALL HUMANITY ALL HIS SUBORDINATES
7762-280917-0040 AND HERE NOT MORE THAN AN HOUR HAD PASSED AND IN ALL HIS ACHING HEART HE FELT AND KNEW THAT HE HATED PSELDONIMOV AND WAS CURSING HIM HIS WIFE AND HIS WEDDING
7762-280917-0041 OF COURSE AS HE SAT DOWN TO TABLE
7762-280917-0042 WOULD SOONER HAVE HAD HIS HAND CUT OFF THAN HAVE OWNED NOT ONLY ALOUD BUT EVEN TO HIMSELF THAT THIS WAS REALLY SO THE MOMENT HAD NOT FULLY ARRIVED YET THERE WAS STILL A MORAL VACILLATION
7762-280917-0043 NOT MERELY TO HAVE GONE AWAY BUT TO HAVE MADE HIS ESCAPE THAT ALL THIS WAS NOT THE SAME BUT HAD TURNED OUT UTTERLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE HAD DREAMED OF ON THE PAVEMENT
7762-280917-0044 WHY DID I COME DID I COME HERE TO EAT AND DRINK HE ASKED HIMSELF AS HE TASTED THE SALT HERRING HE EVEN HAD ATTACKS OF SCEPTICISM
7762-280917-0045 AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART HE ACTUALLY WONDERED AT TIMES WHY HE HAD COME IN BUT HOW COULD HE GO AWAY TO GO AWAY LIKE THIS WITHOUT HAVING FINISHED THE BUSINESS PROPERLY WAS IMPOSSIBLE WHAT WOULD PEOPLE SAY
7762-280917-0046 THEY WOULD SAY THAT HE WAS FREQUENTING LOW COMPANY INDEED IT REALLY WOULD AMOUNT TO THAT IF HE DID NOT END IT PROPERLY
7762-280917-0047 IN SUCH A WAY THAT ALL SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHY HE HAD COME HE MUST MAKE CLEAR HIS MORAL AIM AND MEANTIME THE DRAMATIC MOMENT WOULD NOT PRESENT ITSELF THEY DON'T EVEN RESPECT ME HE WENT ON THINKING
7762-280917-0048 WHAT ARE THEY LAUGHING AT THEY ARE AS FREE AND EASY AS THOUGH THEY HAD NO FEELING BUT I HAVE LONG SUSPECTED THAT ALL THE YOUNGER GENERATION ARE WITHOUT FEELING I MUST REMAIN AT ALL COSTS
7762-280917-0049 THEY HAVE JUST BEEN DANCING BUT NOW AT TABLE THEY WILL ALL BE GATHERED TOGETHER I WILL TALK ABOUT QUESTIONS ABOUT REFORMS ABOUT THE GREATNESS OF RUSSIA I CAN STILL WIN THEIR ENTHUSIASM YES
7762-280917-0050 PERHAPS NOTHING IS YET LOST PERHAPS IT IS ALWAYS LIKE THIS IN REALITY WHAT SHOULD I BEGIN UPON WITH THEM TO ATTRACT THEM
7762-280917-0051 AND WHAT IS IT THEY WANT WHAT IS IT THEY REQUIRE I SEE THEY ARE LAUGHING TOGETHER THERE CAN IT BE AT ME MERCIFUL HEAVENS BUT WHAT IS IT I WANT WHY IS IT I AM HERE
7762-280917-0052 WHY DON'T I GO AWAY WHY DO I GO ON PERSISTING
7762-280917-0053 BUT EVERYTHING WENT ON IN THE SAME WAY ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER JUST TWO MINUTES AFTER HE HAD SAT DOWN TO THE TABLE ONE TERRIBLE THOUGHT OVERWHELMED HIM COMPLETELY HE SUDDENLY FELT
7762-280917-0054 THAT IS NOT AS HE WAS BEFORE BUT HOPELESSLY DRUNK THE CAUSE OF THIS WAS THE GLASS OF VODKA WHICH HE HAD DRUNK AFTER THE CHAMPAGNE AND WHICH HAD IMMEDIATELY PRODUCED AN EFFECT HE WAS CONSCIOUS HE FELT IN EVERY FIBRE OF HIS BEING
7762-280917-0055 OF COURSE HIS ASSURANCE WAS GREATLY INCREASED BUT CONSCIOUSNESS HAD NOT DESERTED HIM AND IT KEPT CRYING OUT IT IS BAD VERY BAD AND IN FACT UTTERLY UNSEEMLY OF COURSE HIS UNSTABLE DRUNKEN REFLECTIONS
7762-280917-0056 COULD NOT REST LONG ON ONE SUBJECT THERE BEGAN TO BE APPARENT AND UNMISTAKABLY SO EVEN TO HIMSELF TWO OPPOSITE SIDES ON ONE SIDE THERE WAS SWAGGERING ASSURANCE A DESIRE TO CONQUER
7762-280917-0057 A DISDAIN OF OBSTACLES AND A DESPERATE CONFIDENCE THAT HE WOULD ATTAIN HIS OBJECT THE OTHER SIDE SHOWED ITSELF IN THE ACHING OF HIS HEART AND A SORT OF GNAWING IN HIS SOUL WHAT WOULD THEY SAY HOW WOULD IT ALL END
7762-280917-0058 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MORROW TO MORROW TO MORROW HE HAD FELT VAGUELY BEFORE THAT HE HAD ENEMIES IN THE COMPANY NO DOUBT THAT WAS BECAUSE I WAS DRUNK HE THOUGHT WITH AGONISING DOUBT
7762-280917-0059 WHAT WAS HIS HORROR WHEN HE ACTUALLY BY UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS CONVINCED HIMSELF NOW THAT HE REALLY HAD ENEMIES AT THE TABLE AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT OF IT AND WHY WHY HE WONDERED
7762-280917-0060 AT THE TABLE THERE WERE ALL THE THIRTY GUESTS OF WHOM SEVERAL WERE QUITE TIPSY OTHERS WERE BEHAVING WITH A CARELESS AND SINISTER INDEPENDENCE SHOUTING AND TALKING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES BAWLING OUT THE TOASTS BEFORE THE TIME
7762-280917-0061 AND PELTING THE LADIES WITH PELLETS OF BREAD ONE UNPREPOSSESSING PERSONAGE IN A GREASY COAT HAD FALLEN OFF HIS CHAIR AS SOON AS HE SAT DOWN AND REMAINED SO TILL THE END OF SUPPER
7762-280917-0062 ANOTHER ONE MADE DESPERATE EFFORTS TO STAND ON THE TABLE TO PROPOSE A TOAST AND ONLY THE OFFICER WHO SEIZED HIM BY THE TAILS OF HIS COAT MODERATED HIS PREMATURE ARDOUR
7762-280917-0063 THE SUPPER WAS A PELL MELL AFFAIR ALTHOUGH THEY HAD HIRED A COOK WHO HAD BEEN IN THE SERVICE OF A GENERAL THERE WAS THE GALANTINE THERE WAS TONGUE AND POTATOES THERE WERE RISSOLES WITH GREEN PEAS
7762-280917-0064 VODKA AND SHERRY THE ONLY BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE WAS STANDING BESIDE THE GENERAL WHICH OBLIGED HIM TO POUR IT OUT FOR HIMSELF AND ALSO FOR AKIM PETROVITCH WHO DID NOT VENTURE AT SUPPER TO OFFICIATE ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE
7762-280917-0065 THE OTHER GUESTS HAD TO DRINK THE TOASTS IN CAUCASIAN WINE OR ANYTHING ELSE THEY COULD GET THE TABLE WAS MADE UP OF SEVERAL TABLES PUT TOGETHER AMONG THEM EVEN A CARD TABLE
7762-280917-0066 IT WAS COVERED WITH MANY TABLECLOTHS AMONGST THEM ONE COLOURED YAROSLAV CLOTH THE GENTLEMEN SAT ALTERNATELY WITH THE LADIES PSELDONIMOV'S MOTHER WOULD NOT SIT DOWN TO THE TABLE

7762-280917-0068 APPEARED ON THE SCENE WEARING A REDDISH SILK DRESS WITH A VERY HIGH CAP ON HER HEAD AND A BANDAGE ROUND HER FACE FOR TOOTHACHE IT APPEARED THAT THIS WAS THE BRIDE'S MOTHER WHO HAD AT LAST CONSENTED TO EMERGE FROM A BACK ROOM FOR SUPPER
7762-280917-0069 THIS LADY LOOKED SPITEFULLY EVEN SARCASTICALLY AT THE GENERAL AND EVIDENTLY DID NOT WISH TO BE PRESENTED TO HIM
7762-280917-0070 SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS WERE SUSPICIOUS AND INSPIRED INVOLUNTARY APPREHENSION AND UNEASINESS
7762-280917-0071 A GENTLEMAN WITH A BEARD SOME SORT OF FREE ARTIST WAS PARTICULARLY SINISTER
7762-280917-0072 ANOTHER PERSON PRESENT WAS UNMISTAKABLY DRUNK BUT YET FROM CERTAIN SIGNS WAS TO BE REGARDED WITH SUSPICION THE MEDICAL STUDENT TOO GAVE RISE TO UNPLEASANT EXPECTATIONS
7762-280917-0073 EVEN THE OFFICER HIMSELF WAS NOT QUITE TO BE DEPENDED ON BUT THE YOUNG MAN ON THE COMIC PAPER WAS BLAZING WITH HATRED HE LOLLED IN HIS CHAIR HE LOOKED SO HAUGHTY AND CONCEITED HE SNORTED SO AGGRESSIVELY
7762-280917-0074 ALL THIS OF COURSE HAD A PITIABLE EFFECT ON HIM ANOTHER OBSERVATION WAS PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT IVAN ILYITCH BECAME AWARE THAT HE WAS BEGINNING TO ARTICULATE INDISTINCTLY AND WITH DIFFICULTY
7762-280917-0075 BUT THAT HIS TONGUE REFUSED TO OBEY HIM AND THEN HE SUDDENLY SEEMED TO FORGET HIMSELF AND WORST OF ALL HE WOULD SUDDENLY BURST INTO A LOUD GUFFAW OF LAUGHTER A PROPOS OF NOTHING
7762-280917-0076 AFTER THAT GLASS HE FELT AT ONCE ALMOST INCLINED TO CRY HE FELT THAT HE WAS SINKING INTO A MOST PECULIAR STATE OF SENTIMENTALITY HE BEGAN TO BE AGAIN FILLED WITH LOVE HE LOVED EVERY ONE
7762-280917-0077 EVEN PSELDONIMOV EVEN THE YOUNG MAN ON THE COMIC PAPER
7762-280917-0078 WHAT IS MORE TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING OPENLY ALL
7762-280917-0079 THAT IS TO TELL THEM WHAT A GOOD NICE MAN HE WAS WITH WHAT WONDERFUL TALENTS WHAT SERVICES HE WOULD DO FOR HIS COUNTRY HOW GOOD HE WAS AT ENTERTAINING THE FAIR SEX AND ABOVE ALL HOW PROGRESSIVE HE WAS
7762-280917-0080 HOW HUMANELY READY HE WAS TO BE INDULGENT TO ALL TO THE VERY LOWEST AND FINALLY IN CONCLUSION
7762-280917-0081 TO TELL THEM FRANKLY ALL THE MOTIVES THAT HAD IMPELLED HIM TO TURN UP AT PSELDONIMOV'S UNINVITED TO DRINK TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE AND TO MAKE HIM HAPPY WITH HIS PRESENCE THE TRUTH THE HOLY TRUTH AND CANDOUR BEFORE ALL THINGS
