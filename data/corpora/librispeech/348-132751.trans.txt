348-132751-0000 A TIME HAD ARRIVED AT WHICH IT WAS IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THERE SHOULD BE ENTIRE CONCORD BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS TILL AFTER THE SUPPRESSION OF THE WESTERN INSURRECTION GRAVE CAUSES OF DISSENSION HAD SEPARATED WILLIAM
348-132751-0001 BOTH FROM WHIGS AND TORIES HE HAD SEEN WITH DISPLEASURE THE ATTEMPTS OF THE WHIGS TO STRIP THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT OF SOME POWERS WHICH HE THOUGHT NECESSARY TO ITS EFFICIENCY AND DIGNITY
348-132751-0002 HE HAD SEEN WITH STILL DEEPER DISPLEASURE THE COUNTENANCE GIVEN BY A LARGE SECTION OF THAT PARTY TO THE PRETENSIONS OF MONMOUTH THE OPPOSITION IT SEEMED WISHED FIRST TO MAKE THE CROWN OF ENGLAND NOT WORTH THE WEARING
348-132751-0003 AND THEN TO PLACE IT ON THE HEAD OF A BASTARD AND IMPOSTOR AT THE SAME TIME THE PRINCE'S RELIGIOUS SYSTEM DIFFERED WIDELY FROM THAT WHICH WAS THE BADGE OF THE TORIES THEY WERE ARMINIANS AND PRELATISTS
348-132751-0004 THEY LOOKED DOWN ON THE PROTESTANT CHURCHES OF THE CONTINENT AND REGARDED EVERY LINE OF THEIR OWN LITURGY AND RUBRIC AS SCARCELY LESS SACRED THAN THE GOSPELS HIS OPINIONS TOUCHING THE METAPHYSICS OF THEOLOGY WERE CALVINISTIC
348-132751-0005 HIS OPINIONS RESPECTING ECCLESIASTICAL POLITY AND MODES OF WORSHIP WERE LATITUDINARIAN HE OWNED THAT EPISCOPACY WAS A LAWFUL AND CONVENIENT FORM OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT BUT HE SPOKE WITH SHARPNESS AND SCORN OF THE BIGOTRY OF THOSE
348-132751-0006 WHO THOUGHT EPISCOPAL ORDINATION ESSENTIAL TO A CHRISTIAN SOCIETY HE HAD NO SCRUPLE ABOUT THE VESTMENTS AND GESTURES PRESCRIBED BY THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER BUT HE AVOWED THAT HE SHOULD LIKE THE RITES OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND BETTER
348-132751-0007 IF THEY REMINDED HIM LESS OF THE RITES OF THE CHURCH OF ROME HE HAD BEEN HEARD TO UTTER AN OMINOUS GROWL WHEN FIRST HE SAW IN HIS WIFE'S PRIVATE CHAPEL AN ALTAR DECKED AFTER THE ANGLICAN FASHION
348-132751-0008 BUT WITHOUT FEELING A STRONG PREDILECTION FOR EITHER SIDE NOR IN TRUTH DID HE EVER TO THE END OF HIS LIFE BECOME EITHER A WHIG OR A TORY HE WANTED THAT WHICH IS THE COMMON GROUNDWORK OF BOTH CHARACTERS
348-132751-0009 FOR HE NEVER BECAME AN ENGLISHMAN HE SAVED ENGLAND IT IS TRUE BUT HE NEVER LOVED HER AND HE NEVER OBTAINED HER LOVE TO HIM SHE WAS ALWAYS A LAND OF EXILE VISITED WITH RELUCTANCE AND QUITTED WITH DELIGHT
348-132751-0010 EVEN WHEN HE RENDERED TO HER THOSE SERVICES OF WHICH AT THIS DAY WE FEEL THE HAPPY EFFECTS HER WELFARE WAS NOT HIS CHIEF OBJECT WHATEVER PATRIOTIC FEELING HE HAD WAS FOR HOLLAND
348-132751-0011 THERE WAS THE STATELY TOMB WHERE SLEPT THE GREAT POLITICIAN WHOSE BLOOD WHOSE NAME WHOSE TEMPERAMENT AND WHOSE GENIUS HE HAD INHERITED
348-132751-0012 WAS A SPELL WHICH HAD THROUGH THREE GENERATIONS CALLED FORTH THE AFFECTIONATE ENTHUSIASM OF BOORS AND ARTISANS THE DUTCH LANGUAGE WAS THE LANGUAGE OF HIS NURSERY AMONG THE DUTCH GENTRY HE HAD CHOSEN HIS EARLY FRIENDS
348-132751-0013 THE AMUSEMENTS THE ARCHITECTURE THE LANDSCAPE OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HAD TAKEN HOLD ON HIS HEART TO HER HE TURNED WITH CONSTANT FONDNESS FROM A PROUDER AND FAIRER RIVAL IN THE GALLERY OF WHITEHALL
348-132751-0014 HE PINED FOR THE FAMILIAR HOUSE IN THE WOOD AT THE HAGUE AND NEVER WAS SO HAPPY AS WHEN HE COULD QUIT THE MAGNIFICENCE OF WINDSOR FOR HIS FAR HUMBLER SEAT AT LOO DURING HIS SPLENDID BANISHMENT
348-132751-0015 IT WAS HIS CONSOLATION TO CREATE ROUND HIM BY BUILDING PLANTING AND DIGGING A SCENE WHICH MIGHT REMIND HIM OF THE FORMAL PILES OF RED BRICK OF THE LONG CANALS AND OF THE SYMMETRICAL FLOWER BEDS AMIDST WHICH HIS EARLY LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED
348-132751-0016 YET EVEN HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH WAS SUBORDINATE TO ANOTHER FEELING WHICH EARLY BECAME SUPREME IN HIS SOUL WHICH MIXED ITSELF WITH ALL HIS PASSIONS WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO MARVELLOUS ENTERPRISES WHICH SUPPORTED HIM
348-132751-0017 WHEN SINKING UNDER MORTIFICATION PAIN SICKNESS AND SORROW WHICH TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF HIS CAREER SEEMED DURING A SHORT TIME TO LANGUISH BUT WHICH SOON BROKE FORTH AGAIN FIERCER THAN EVER AND CONTINUED TO ANIMATE HIM
348-132751-0018 EVEN WHILE THE PRAYER FOR THE DEPARTING WAS READ AT HIS BEDSIDE THAT FEELING WAS ENMITY TO FRANCE AND TO THE MAGNIFICENT KING WHO IN MORE THAN ONE SENSE
348-132751-0019 REPRESENTED FRANCE AND WHO TO VIRTUES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS EMINENTLY FRENCH JOINED IN LARGE MEASURE THAT UNQUIET UNSCRUPULOUS AND VAINGLORIOUS AMBITION WHICH HAS REPEATEDLY DRAWN ON FRANCE THE RESENTMENT OF EUROPE
348-132751-0020 IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE SENTIMENT WHICH GRADUALLY POSSESSED ITSELF OF WILLIAM'S WHOLE SOUL WHEN HE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A BOY HIS COUNTRY HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY LEWIS IN OSTENTATIOUS DEFIANCE OF JUSTICE AND PUBLIC LAW
348-132751-0021 THAT IF THEY DESIRED PEACE THEY MUST RESIGN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND DO ANNUAL HOMAGE TO THE HOUSE OF BOURBON THE INJURED NATION DRIVEN TO DESPAIR HAD OPENED ITS DYKES
348-132751-0022 IT WAS IN THE AGONY OF THAT CONFLICT WHEN PEASANTS WERE FLYING IN TERROR BEFORE THE INVADERS WHEN HUNDREDS OF FAIR GARDENS AND PLEASURE HOUSES WERE BURIED BENEATH THE WAVES WHEN THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE STATES WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE FAINTING
348-132751-0023 AND THE LOUD WEEPING OF ANCIENT SENATORS WHO COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF SURVIVING THE FREEDOM AND GLORY OF THEIR NATIVE LAND THAT WILLIAM HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE HEAD OF AFFAIRS FOR A TIME IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT RESISTANCE WAS HOPELESS
348-132751-0024 HE LOOKED ROUND FOR SUCCOUR AND LOOKED IN VAIN SPAIN WAS UNNERVED GERMANY DISTRACTED ENGLAND CORRUPTED NOTHING SEEMED LEFT TO THE YOUNG STADTHOLDER BUT TO PERISH SWORD IN HAND
348-132751-0025 AND TO CREATE ANOTHER HOLLAND IN COUNTRIES BEYOND THE REACH OF THE TYRANNY OF FRANCE NO OBSTACLE WOULD THEN REMAIN TO CHECK THE PROGRESS OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON A FEW YEARS AND THAT HOUSE MIGHT ADD TO ITS DOMINIONS
348-132751-0026 LORAINE AND FLANDERS
348-132751-0027 NAPLES AND MILAN MEXICO AND PERU
348-132751-0028 MIGHT PLACE A PRINCE OF HIS FAMILY ON THE THRONE OF POLAND MIGHT BE SOLE MASTER OF EUROPE FROM THE SCYTHIAN DESERTS TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND OF AMERICA FROM REGIONS NORTH OF THE TROPIC OF CANCER
348-132751-0029 TO REGIONS SOUTH OF THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN SUCH WAS THE PROSPECT WHICH LAY BEFORE WILLIAM WHEN FIRST HE ENTERED ON PUBLIC LIFE AND WHICH NEVER CEASED TO HAUNT HIM TILL HIS LATEST DAY THE FRENCH MONARCHY
348-132751-0030 WAS TO HIM WHAT THE ROMAN REPUBLIC WAS TO HANNIBAL WHAT THE OTTOMAN POWER WAS TO SCANDERBEG
348-132751-0031 WAS TO WALLACE RELIGION GAVE HER SANCTION TO THAT INTENSE AND UNQUENCHABLE ANIMOSITY HUNDREDS OF CALVINISTIC PREACHERS PROCLAIMED THAT THE SAME POWER WHICH HAD SET APART SAMSON FROM THE WOMB
348-132751-0032 HE HAD A GREAT WORK TO DO AND TILL IT WAS DONE NOTHING COULD HARM HIM THEREFORE IT WAS THAT
348-132751-0033 HE RECOVERED FROM MALADIES WHICH SEEMED HOPELESS THAT BANDS OF ASSASSINS CONSPIRED IN VAIN AGAINST HIS LIFE THAT THE OPEN SKIFF TO WHICH HE TRUSTED HIMSELF ON A STARLESS NIGHT ON A RAGING OCEAN AND NEAR A TREACHEROUS SHORE
348-132751-0034 BROUGHT HIM SAFE TO LAND AND THAT ON TWENTY FIELDS OF BATTLE THE CANNON BALLS PASSED HIM BY TO RIGHT AND LEFT THE ARDOUR AND PERSEVERANCE WITH WHICH HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO HIS MISSION
348-132751-0035 TO THINK VERY LIGHTLY OF THE BLOODSHED AND DEVASTATION INSEPARABLE FROM GREAT MARTIAL EXPLOITS AND THE HEART OF WILLIAM WAS STEELED NOT ONLY BY PROFESSIONAL INSENSIBILITY BUT BY THAT STERNER INSENSIBILITY
348-132751-0036 WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF A SENSE OF DUTY THREE GREAT COALITIONS THREE LONG AND BLOODY WARS IN WHICH ALL EUROPE FROM THE VISTULA TO THE WESTERN OCEAN WAS IN ARMS ARE TO BE ASCRIBED TO HIS UNCONQUERABLE ENERGY
348-132751-0037 WHEN IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE STATES GENERAL EXHAUSTED AND DISHEARTENED WERE DESIRIOUS OF REPOSE HIS VOICE WAS STILL AGAINST SHEATHING THE SWORD IF PEACE WAS MADE IT WAS MADE ONLY BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BREATHE INTO OTHER MEN
348-132751-0038 A SPIRIT AS FIERCE AND DETERMINED AS HIS OWN AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT
348-132751-0039 HE FOUGHT ONE OF THE MOST BLOODY AND OBSTINATE BATTLES OF THAT AGE FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE TREATY OF NIMEGUEN WAS SIGNED
348-132751-0040 HIS CONTEST WITH LEWIS TRANSFERRED FROM THE FIELD TO THE CABINET WAS SOON EXASPERATED BY A PRIVATE FEUD IN TALENTS TEMPER MANNERS AND OPINIONS THE RIVALS WERE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER
348-132751-0041 LEWIS POLITE AND DIGNIFIED PROFUSE AND VOLUPTUOUS FOND OF DISPLAY AND AVERSE FROM DANGER A MUNIFICENT PATRON OF ARTS AND LETTERS AND A CRUEL PERSECUTOR OF CALVINISTS
348-132751-0042 PRESENTED A REMARKABLE CONTRAST TO WILLIAM SIMPLE IN TASTES UNGRACIOUS IN DEMEANOUR INDEFATIGABLE AND INTREPID IN WAR REGARDLESS OF ALL THE ORNAMENTAL BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE
348-132751-0043 AND FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE THEOLOGY OF GENEVA THE ENEMIES DID NOT LONG OBSERVE THOSE COURTESIES WHICH MEN OF THEIR RANK EVEN WHEN OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER AT THE HEAD OF ARMIES SELDOM NEGLECT WILLIAM INDEED
348-132751-0044 WENT THROUGH THE FORM OF TENDERING HIS BEST SERVICES TO LEWIS BUT THIS CIVILITY WAS RATED AT ITS TRUE VALUE AND REQUITED WITH A DRY REPRIMAND THE GREAT KING AFFECTED CONTEMPT FOR THE PETTY PRINCE
348-132751-0045 WHO WAS THE SERVANT OF A CONFEDERACY OF TRADING TOWNS AND TO EVERY MARK OF CONTEMPT THE DAUNTLESS STADTHOLDER REPLIED BY A FRESH DEFIANCE WILLIAM TOOK HIS TITLE
348-132751-0046 A TITLE WHICH THE EVENTS OF THE PRECEDING CENTURY HAD MADE ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS IN EUROPE FROM A CITY WHICH LIES ON THE BANKS OF THE RHONE NOT FAR FROM AVIGNON AND WHICH LIKE AVIGNON
348-132751-0047 THOUGH INCLOSED ON EVERY SIDE BY THE FRENCH TERRITORY WAS PROPERLY A FIEF NOT OF THE FRENCH BUT OF THE IMPERIAL CROWN LEWIS WITH THAT OSTENTATIOUS CONTEMPT OF PUBLIC LAW WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM
348-132751-0048 OCCUPIED ORANGE DISMANTLED THE FORTIFICATIONS AND CONFISCATED THE REVENUES WILLIAM DECLARED ALOUD AT HIS TABLE BEFORE MANY PERSONS THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING REPENT THE OUTRAGE
348-132751-0049 AND WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THESE WORDS BY THE COUNT OF AVAUX POSITIVELY REFUSED EITHER TO RETRACT THEM OR TO EXPLAIN THEM AWAY
