2351-151965-0000 MAGGIE'S INTENTIONS AS USUAL WERE ON A LARGER SCALE THAN TOM IMAGINED THE RESOLUTION THAT GATHERED IN HER MIND AFTER TOM AND LUCY HAD WALKED AWAY WAS NOT SO SIMPLE AS THAT OF GOING HOME NO
2351-151965-0001 SHE WOULD RUN AWAY AND GO TO THE GYPSIES AND TOM SHOULD NEVER SEE HER ANY MORE THAT WAS BY NO MEANS A NEW IDEA TO MAGGIE SHE HAD BEEN SO OFTEN TOLD SHE WAS LIKE A GYPSY AND HALF WILD
2351-151965-0002 THAT WHEN SHE WAS MISERABLE IT SEEMED TO HER THE ONLY WAY OF ESCAPING OPPROBRIUM AND BEING ENTIRELY IN HARMONY WITH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE TO LIVE IN A LITTLE BROWN TENT ON THE COMMONS THE GYPSIES SHE CONSIDERED WOULD GLADLY RECEIVE HER
2351-151965-0003 AND PAY HER MUCH RESPECT ON ACCOUNT OF HER SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE SHE HAD ONCE MENTIONED HER VIEWS ON THIS POINT TO TOM AND SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD STAIN HIS FACE BROWN AND THEY SHOULD RUN AWAY TOGETHER BUT TOM REJECTED THE SCHEME WITH CONTEMPT
2351-151965-0004 OBSERVING THAT GYPSIES WERE THIEVES AND HARDLY GOT ANYTHING TO EAT AND HAD NOTHING TO DRIVE BUT A DONKEY TO DAY HOWEVER MAGGIE THOUGHT HER MISERY HAD REACHED A PITCH AT WHICH GYPSYDOM WAS HER REFUGE
2351-151965-0005 AND SHE ROSE FROM HER SEAT ON THE ROOTS OF THE TREE WITH THE SENSE THAT THIS WAS A GREAT CRISIS IN HER LIFE SHE WOULD RUN STRAIGHT AWAY TILL SHE CAME TO DUNLOW COMMON WHERE THERE WOULD CERTAINLY BE GYPSIES AND CRUEL TOM
2351-151965-0006 AND THE REST OF HER RELATIONS WHO FOUND FAULT WITH HER SHOULD NEVER SEE HER ANY MORE SHE THOUGHT OF HER FATHER AS SHE RAN ALONG BUT SHE RECONCILED HERSELF TO THE IDEA OF PARTING WITH HIM
2351-151965-0007 BY DETERMINING THAT SHE WOULD SECRETLY SEND HIM A LETTER BY A SMALL GYPSY WHO WOULD RUN AWAY WITHOUT TELLING WHERE SHE WAS AND JUST LET HIM KNOW THAT SHE WAS WELL AND HAPPY AND ALWAYS LOVED HIM VERY MUCH
2351-151965-0008 REFLECTING THAT RUNNING AWAY WAS NOT A PLEASANT THING UNTIL ONE HAD GOT QUITE TO THE COMMON WHERE THE GYPSIES WERE BUT HER RESOLUTION HAD NOT ABATED SHE PRESENTLY PASSED THROUGH THE GATE INTO THE LANE NOT KNOWING WHERE IT WOULD LEAD HER
2351-151965-0009 FOR IT WAS NOT THIS WAY THAT THEY CAME FROM DORLCOTE MILL TO GARUM FIRS AND SHE FELT ALL THE SAFER FOR THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HER BEING OVERTAKEN BUT SHE WAS SOON AWARE NOT WITHOUT TREMBLING
2351-151965-0010 THAT THERE WERE TWO MEN COMING ALONG THE LANE IN FRONT OF HER SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF MEETING STRANGERS SHE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THE IDEA OF HER FRIENDS COMING AFTER HER THE FORMIDABLE STRANGERS WERE TWO SHABBY LOOKING MEN WITH FLUSHED FACES
2351-151965-0011 ONE OF THEM CARRYING A BUNDLE ON A STICK OVER HIS SHOULDER BUT TO HER SURPRISE WHILE SHE WAS DREADING THEIR DISAPPROBATION AS A RUNAWAY THE MAN WITH THE BUNDLE STOPPED AND IN A HALF WHINING HALF COAXING TONE
2351-151965-0012 ASKED HER IF SHE HAD A COPPER TO GIVE A POOR MAN MAGGIE HAD A SIXPENCE IN HER POCKET HER UNCLE GLEGG'S PRESENT WHICH SHE IMMEDIATELY DREW OUT AND GAVE THIS POOR MAN WITH A POLITE SMILE
2351-151965-0013 THAT'S THE ONLY MONEY I'VE GOT SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY THANK YOU LITTLE MISS SAID THE MAN IN A LESS RESPECTFUL AND GRATEFUL TONE THAN MAGGIE ANTICIPATED AND SHE EVEN OBSERVED THAT HE SMILED AND WINKED AT HIS COMPANION
2351-151965-0014 IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO MAKE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION ON PASSENGERS AND SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD TURN INTO THE FIELDS AGAIN BUT NOT ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE LANE AS BEFORE LEST THEY SHOULD STILL BE UNCLE PULLET'S FIELDS
2351-151965-0015 SOMETIMES SHE HAD TO CLIMB OVER HIGH GATES BUT THAT WAS A SMALL EVIL SHE WAS GETTING OUT OF REACH VERY FAST AND SHE SHOULD PROBABLY SOON COME WITHIN SIGHT OF DUNLOW COMMON OR AT LEAST OF SOME OTHER COMMON
2351-151965-0016 FOR SHE HAD HEARD HER FATHER SAY THAT YOU COULDN'T GO VERY FAR WITHOUT COMING TO A COMMON SHE HOPED SO FOR SHE WAS GETTING RATHER TIRED AND HUNGRY AND UNTIL SHE REACHED THE GYPSIES THERE WAS NO DEFINITE PROSPECT OF BREAD AND BUTTER
2351-151965-0017 AND IT WAS REALLY SURPRISING THAT THE COMMON DID NOT COME WITHIN SIGHT HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN IN THE RICH PARISH OF GARUM WHERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF PASTURE LAND AND SHE HAD ONLY SEEN ONE LABORER AT A DISTANCE
2351-151965-0018 THAT WAS FORTUNATE IN SOME RESPECTS AS LABORERS MIGHT BE TOO IGNORANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PROPRIETY OF HER WANTING TO GO TO DUNLOW COMMON YET IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF SHE COULD HAVE MET SOME ONE WHO WOULD TELL HER THE WAY WITHOUT WANTING TO KNOW ANYTHING
2351-151965-0019 ABOUT HER PRIVATE BUSINESS AT LAST HOWEVER THE GREEN FIELDS CAME TO AN END AND MAGGIE FOUND HERSELF LOOKING THROUGH THE BARS OF A GATE INTO A LANE WITH A WIDE MARGIN OF GRASS ON EACH SIDE OF IT
2351-151965-0020 SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A WIDE LANE BEFORE AND WITHOUT HER KNOWING WHY IT GAVE HER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE COMMON COULD NOT BE FAR OFF PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE SAW A DONKEY WITH A LOG TO HIS FOOT FEEDING ON THE GRASSY MARGIN
2351-151965-0021 AND THE DARING THAT COMES FROM OVERMASTERING IMPULSE SHE HAD RUSHED INTO THE ADVENTURE OF SEEKING HER UNKNOWN KINDRED THE GYPSIES AND NOW SHE WAS IN THIS STRANGE LANE SHE HARDLY DARED LOOK ON ONE SIDE OF HER
2351-151965-0022 LEST SHE SHOULD SEE THE DIABOLICAL BLACKSMITH IN HIS LEATHERN APRON GRINNING AT HER WITH ARMS AKIMBO IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A LEAPING OF THE HEART THAT SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A SMALL PAIR OF BARE LEGS STICKING UP FEET UPPERMOST BY THE SIDE OF A HILLOCK
2351-151965-0023 ASLEEP AND MAGGIE TROTTED ALONG FASTER AND MORE LIGHTLY LEST SHE SHOULD WAKE HIM IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER THAT HE WAS ONE OF HER FRIENDS THE GYPSIES WHO IN ALL PROBABILITY WOULD HAVE VERY GENIAL MANNERS BUT THE FACT WAS SO
2351-151965-0024 FOR AT THE NEXT BEND IN THE LANE MAGGIE ACTUALLY SAW THE LITTLE SEMICIRCULAR BLACK TENT WITH THE BLUE SMOKE RISING BEFORE IT WHICH WAS TO BE HER REFUGE FROM ALL THE BLIGHTING OBLOQUY THAT HAD PURSUED HER IN CIVILIZED LIFE
2351-151965-0025 DOUBTLESS THE GYPSY MOTHER WHO PROVIDED THE TEA AND OTHER GROCERIES IT WAS ASTONISHING TO HERSELF THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL MORE DELIGHTED BUT IT WAS STARTLING TO FIND THE GYPSIES IN A LANE AFTER ALL AND NOT ON A COMMON INDEED
2351-151965-0026 IT WAS DELIGHTFUL AND JUST WHAT MAGGIE EXPECTED THE GYPSIES SAW AT ONCE THAT SHE WAS A LITTLE LADY AND WERE PREPARED TO TREAT HER ACCORDINGLY NOT ANY FARTHER SAID MAGGIE FEELING AS IF SHE WERE SAYING WHAT SHE HAD REHEARSED IN A DREAM
2351-151965-0027 TAKING HER BY THE HAND MAGGIE THOUGHT HER VERY AGREEABLE BUT WISHED SHE HAD NOT BEEN SO DIRTY THERE WAS QUITE A GROUP ROUND THE FIRE WHEN SHE REACHED IT AN OLD GYPSY WOMAN WAS SEATED ON THE GROUND NURSING HER KNEES
2351-151965-0028 WHO LYING ON HER BACK WAS SCRATCHING HIS NOSE
2351-151965-0029 THE SLANTING SUNLIGHT FELL KINDLY UPON THEM AND THE SCENE WAS REALLY VERY PRETTY AND COMFORTABLE MAGGIE THOUGHT ONLY SHE HOPED THEY WOULD SOON SET OUT THE TEA CUPS EVERYTHING WOULD BE QUITE CHARMING
2351-151965-0030 WHEN SHE HAD TAUGHT THE GYPSIES TO USE A WASHING BASIN AND TO FEEL AN INTEREST IN BOOKS IT WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING THOUGH THAT THE YOUNG WOMAN BEGAN TO SPEAK TO THE OLD ONE IN A LANGUAGE WHICH MAGGIE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHILE THE TALL GIRL WHO WAS FEEDING THE DONKEY
2351-151965-0031 SAT UP AND STARED AT HER WITHOUT OFFERING ANY SALUTATION AT LAST THE OLD WOMAN SAID WHAT MY PRETTY LADY ARE YOU COME TO STAY WITH US SIT YE DOWN AND TELL US WHERE YOU COME FROM IT WAS JUST LIKE A STORY
2351-151965-0032 MAGGIE LIKED TO BE CALLED PRETTY LADY AND TREATED IN THIS WAY SHE SAT DOWN AND SAID
