5480-41798-0000 MOTHER CAREY'S CHICKENS
5480-41798-0001 OLD AND NEW THE YELLOW HOUSE HAD NOT ALWAYS BELONGED TO THE HAMILTONS BUT HAD BEEN BUILT BY A GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHEN HE RETIRED FROM PUBLIC OFFICE HE LIVED ONLY A FEW YEARS
5480-41798-0002 HE HAD SIMPLY BUILT A LARGE COMFORTABLE COLONIAL HOUSE HE DESIRED NO GARDENS NO LUXURIOUS STABLES NO FOUNTAINS NOR GROTTOES NO BATHROOM FOR IT WAS ONLY THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TEN
5480-41798-0003 WHILE THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET LEFT NOTHING TO BE DESIRED AS A MEANS OF DISPENSING WATER TO THE HOUSEHOLD HE HAD ONE WEAKNESS HOWEVER AND THAT WAS A WISH TO MAKE THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS IMPRESSIVE AS POSSIBLE
5480-41798-0004 THE WINDOW OVER THE FRONT DOOR WAS AS BEAUTIFUL A WINDOW AS ANY IN THE COUNTY AND THE DOORWAY ITSELF WAS CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT HAD A WONDERFUL FAN LIGHT AND SIDE LIGHTS GREEN BLIND DOORS OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE PAINTED ONE WITH ITS MASSIVE BRASS KNOCKER
5480-41798-0005 AND STILL MORE UNIQUE AND IMPRESSIVE IT HAD FOR ITS APPROACH SEMI CIRCULAR STONE STEPS INSTEAD OF THE USUAL OBLONG ONES THE LARGE BLOCKS OF GRANITE HAD BEEN CUT SO THAT EACH OF THE FOUR STEPS SHOULD BE SMALLER THAN THE ONE BELOW IT AND WHEN
5480-41798-0006 AFTER MONTHS OF GOSSIP AND SUSPENSE THEY WERE FINALLY LAID IN PLACE THEIR STRAIGHT EDGES TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND THEIR EXPENSIVE CURVED SIDES TO THE ROAD A PROCESSION OF CURIOUS PERSONS IN WAGONS CARRYALLS BUGGIES AND GIGS WOUND THEIR WAY PAST THE PREMISES
5480-41798-0007 THE GOVERNOR'S CIRC'LAR STEPS BROUGHT MANY PILGRIMS DOWN THE MAIN STREET OF BEULAH FIRST AND LAST AND THE ORIGINAL HAMILTONS HAD BEEN VERY PROUD OF THEM PRIDE OF SUCH SIMPLE THINGS AS STONE STEPS HAD DIED OUT OF THE HAMILTON STOCK IN THE COURSE OF YEARS
5480-41798-0008 AND THE HOUSE HAD BEEN SO LONG VACANT THAT NO ONE BUT LEMUEL THE CONSUL REMEMBERED ANY OF ITS CHARMING FEATURES BUT OSSIAN POPHAM WHEN HE PRIED UP AND STRAIGHTENED THE ANCIENT LANDMARKS HAD MUCH TO SAY OF THE WONDERFUL STEPS
5480-41798-0009 THERE'S SO MUCH GOIN ON NOW A DAYS HE COMPLAINED AS HE PUFFED AND PRIED AND STRAINED AND RESTED IN BETWEEN THAT YOUNG ONES WON'T AMOUNT TO NOTHIN FUST THING YOU KNOW MY BOY DIGBY SAYS TO ME THIS MORNIN
5480-41798-0010 NO POP I AIN'T GOIN HE SAYS IT'S THE SAME OLD FAIR EVERY YEAR LAND SAKES WHEN I WAS A BOY BOUT ONCE A MONTH IN WARM WEATHER
5480-41798-0011 THAT USED TO BE THE LIVELIEST ENTERTAINMENT PARENTS COULD THINK UP FOR THEIR YOUNG ONES AN IT WAS A HEAP LIVELIER THAN TWO SERMONS OF A SUNDAY EACH OF EM AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LONG DIGBY A LAD OF EIGHTEEN AND MASTER OF ONLY ONE TRADE INSTEAD OF A DOZEN
5480-41798-0012 AND ITS OLD WHITE CHAMBER SET REPAINTED BY THE FAITHFUL AND CLEVER POPHAM THE CHINTZ PARLOR ONCE GOVERNOR WEATHERBY'S STUDY WAS FINISHED TOO AND THE WHOLE FAMILY LOOKED IN AT THE DOORS A DOZEN TIMES A DAY WITH ADMIRING EXCLAMATIONS
5480-41798-0013 IT HAD SIX DOORS OPENING INTO TWO ENTRIES ONE SMALL BEDROOM ONE SITTING ROOM ONE CELLAR AND ONE CHINA CLOSET A PASSION FOR ENTRANCES AND EXITS HAVING BEEN THE WHIM OF THAT GENERATION IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN
5480-41798-0014 NANCY HAD ONCE LIGHTED HER CANDLE AND SLIPPED DOWNSTAIRS AT MIDNIGHT TO SIT ON THE PARLOR SOFA AND FEAST HER EYES ON THE ROOM'S LOVELINESS GILBERT HAD PAINTED THE WHITE MATTING THE COLOR OF A RIPE CHERRY
5480-41798-0015 MISSUS POPHAM HAD WASHED AND IRONED AND FLUTED THE OLD WHITE RUFFLED MUSLIN CURTAINS FROM THE CHARLESTOWN HOME AND THEY ADORNED THE FOUR WINDOWS IT WAS THE NORTH ROOM ON THE LEFT AS YOU ENTERED THE HOUSE AND WOULD BE CLOSED DURING THE COLD WINTER MONTHS
5480-41798-0016 THE OLD FASHIONED SQUARE PIANO LOOKED IN ITS ELEMENT PLACED ACROSS ONE CORNER WITH THE FOUR TALL SILVER CANDLESTICKS AND SNUFFER TRAY ON THE SHINING MAHOGANY ALL THE SHABBIEST FURNITURE AND THE CAREY FURNITURE WAS MOSTLY SHABBY
5480-41798-0017 WAS COVERED WITH A CHEAP GAY CHINTZ AND CRIMSON JACQUEMINOT ROSES CLAMBERED ALL OVER THE WALL PAPER
5480-41798-0018 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL WERE THE DOUBLE PARLORS OF THE GOVERNOR'S TIME MADE INTO A GREAT LIVING ROOM HERE WAS GILBERT'S GREEN PAINTED FLOOR SMOOTH AND GLOSSY
5480-41798-0019 HERE ALL THE OLD FASHIONED GILBERT FURNITURE THAT THE CAREYS HAD KEPT DURING THEIR MANY WANDERINGS HERE ALL THE QUAINT CHAIRS THAT MISTER BILL HARMON COULD PICK UP AT A SMALL PRICE HERE WERE TWO NOBLE FIREPLACES ONE WITH A CRANE AND IRON POT FILLED WITH FLOWERS
5480-41798-0020 THE OTHER FILLED SOMETIMES WITH SPRAYS OF GREEN ASPARAGUS AND SOMETIMES WITH FRAGRANT HEMLOCK BOUGHS THE PAPER WAS ONE IN WHICH GREEN RUSHES AND CAT O' NINE TAILS GREW ON A FAWN COLORED GROUND AND ANYTHING THAT THE CAREYS DID NOT POSSESS FOR THE FAMILY SITTING ROOM
5480-41798-0021 OSSIAN POPHAM WENT STRAIGHT HOME AND MADE IN HIS BARN HE COULD MAKE A BARREL CHAIR OR AN HOUR GLASS TABLE A BOX LOUNGE AND THE MATTRESS TO PUT ON TOP OF IT
5480-41798-0022 HE COULD POLISH THE PIANO AND THEN SIT DOWN TO IT AND PLAY THOSE TASSELS ON HER BOOTS OR MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA WITH GREAT SKILL HE COULD PAINT BUNCHES OF GOLD GRAPES AND LEAVES ON THE OLD FASHIONED HIGH BACKED ROCKER AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DRY
5480-41798-0023 COULD SIT DOWN IN IT AND ENTERTAIN THE WHOLE FAMILY WITHOUT CHARGING THEM A PENNY THE HOUSEWARMING COULD NOT BE UNTIL THE LATER AUTUMN MISSUS CAREY HAD DECIDED FOR ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE LIVING ROOMS COULD BE FINISHED
5480-41798-0024 COUSIN ANN'S EXPENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOT TO BE SET IN MOTION UNTIL BILL HARMON HEARD FROM MISTER HAMILTON THAT HIS TENANTS WERE NOT TO BE DISTURBED FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS THE HOUSE WHICH WAS DAILY GROWING INTO A HOME
5480-41798-0025 WAS FULL OF THE BUSY HUM OF LABOR FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND THERE WAS HARDLY A MOMENT WHEN MOTHER CAREY AND THE GIRLS WERE NOT TRANSPORTING ARTICLES OF FURNITURE THROUGH THE ROOMS AND UP AND DOWN THE STAIRCASES TO SEE HOW THEY WOULD LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE
5480-41798-0026 THIS INDEED HAD BEEN THE DIVERSION OF THEIR SIMPLE LIFE FOR MANY YEARS AND WAS JUST AS DELIGHTFUL IN THEIR OPINION AS BUYING NEW THINGS ANY CAREY FROM MOTHER DOWN TO PETER
5480-41798-0027 WOULD SPRING FROM HIS CHAIR AT ANY MOMENT AND ASSIST ANY OTHER CAREY TO MOVE A SOFA A BUREAU A PIANO A KITCHEN STOVE IF NECESSARY WITH THE VIEW OF DETERMINING IF IT WOULD ADD A NEW ZEST TO LIFE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION
5480-41798-0028 NOT A WORD HAS BEEN SAID THUS FAR ABOUT THE YELLOW HOUSE BARN THE BARN THAT THE FOOL HAMILTON BOYS ACCORDING TO BILL HARMON'S THEORIES
5480-41798-0029 INTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE A CAT LAUGH BUT IT REALLY NEEDS A CHAPTER TO ITSELF YOU REMEMBER THAT DOCTOR HOLMES SAYS OF CERTAIN MAJESTIC AND DIGNIFIED TREES THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A CHRISTIAN NAME LIKE OTHER FOLKS THE BARN IN THE SAME WAY
5480-41798-0030 DESERVES MORE DISTINCTION THAN A PARAGRAPH BUT AT THIS MOMENT IT WAS BEING USED AS A STOREROOM AND WAS MERELY AWAITING ITS SPLENDID DESTINY QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FUTURE THE HAMILTON BOYS WERE NO DOUBT AS EXTRAVAGANT AND THRIFTLESS AS THEY WERE INSANE
5480-41798-0031 BUT THE CAREYS SYMPATHIZED WITH THEIR EXTRAVAGANCE AND THRIFTLESSNESS AND INSANITY SO HEARTILY IN THIS PARTICULAR THAT THEY COULD HARDLY CONCEAL THEIR REAL FEELINGS FROM BILL HARMON NOTHING COULD SO HAVE ACCORDED WITH THEIR SECRET DESIRES AS THE FOOL CHANGES MADE BY THE
5480-41798-0032 CRAZY HAMILTON BOYS LIGHT HEARTED IRRESPONSIBLE AND FRIVOLOUS CHANGES THAT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN COMPASSED BY THE CAREYS SLENDER INCOME THEY HAD NO MONEY TO PURCHASE HORSE OR COW OR PIG AND NO MAN IN THE FAMILY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM IF PURCHASED
5480-41798-0033 SO THE REMOVAL OF STALLS AND ALL THE NECESSARY APPURTENANCES FOR THE CARE OF CATTLE WAS NO SOURCE OF GRIEF OR LOSS TO THEM A GOOD FLOOR HAD BEEN LAID OVER THE OLD ONE AND STAINED TO A DARK COLOR THE CEILING WITH ITS HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS
5480-41798-0034 WAS ALMOST AS FINE AS SOME OLD OAK COUNTERPART IN AN ENGLISH HALL NOT A NEW BOARD MET THE EYE OLD WEATHERED LUMBER EVERYWHERE EVEN TO THE QUAINT SETTLE SHAPED BENCHES THAT LINED THE ROOM THERE WAS A PLACE LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED TIE UP FOR MUSICIANS TO PLAY FOR A COUNTRY DANCE
5480-41798-0035 IN FINE THERE WOULD BE WITH THE ADDITION OF CAREY IDEAS HERE AND THERE PROVISION FOR FROLICS AND DIVERSIONS OF ANY SORT YOU NO SOONER OPENED THE DOOR AND PEEPED IN THOUGH FEW OF THE BEULAH VILLAGERS HAD EVER BEEN INVITED TO DO SO BY THE GAY YOUNG HAMILTONS

5480-41798-0040 A PARTY COULD BE GIVEN IN THIS BARN WITH MOTHER TO PLAY THE PIANO AND MISTER POPHAM THE FIDDLE THE REFRESHMENTS WOULD BE INCREDIBLY WEAK LEMONADE AND I THINK WE MIGHT SOLICIT THE CAKE AS THEY DO FOR CHURCH SOCIABLES
