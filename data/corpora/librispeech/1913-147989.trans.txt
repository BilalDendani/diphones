1913-147989-0000 ONE MARCH EVENING IN MY SOPHOMORE YEAR I WAS SITTING ALONE IN MY ROOM AFTER SUPPER
1913-147989-0001 MY WINDOW WAS OPEN AND THE EARTHY WIND BLOWING THROUGH MADE ME INDOLENT ON THE EDGE OF THE PRAIRIE WHERE THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN THE SKY WAS TURQUOISE BLUE LIKE A LAKE WITH GOLD LIGHT THROBBING IN IT HIGHER UP IN THE
1913-147989-0002 UTTER CLARITY OF THE WESTERN SLOPE THE EVENING STAR HUNG LIKE A LAMP SUSPENDED BY SILVER CHAINS LIKE THE LAMP ENGRAVED UPON THE TITLE PAGE OF OLD LATIN TEXTS WHICH IS ALWAYS APPEARING IN NEW HEAVENS AND WAKING NEW DESIRES IN MEN
1913-147989-0003 IT REMINDED ME AT ANY RATE TO SHUT MY WINDOW AND LIGHT MY WICK IN ANSWER I DID SO REGRETFULLY AND THE DIM OBJECTS IN THE ROOM EMERGED FROM THE SHADOWS AND TOOK THEIR PLACE ABOUT ME WITH THE HELPFULNESS WHICH CUSTOM BREEDS
1913-147989-0004 TO BRING THE MUSE INTO MY COUNTRY CLERIC HAD EXPLAINED TO US THAT PATRIA HERE MEANT NOT A NATION OR EVEN A PROVINCE
1913-147989-0005 THIS WAS NOT A BOAST BUT A HOPE AT ONCE BOLD AND DEVOUTLY HUMBLE THAT HE MIGHT BRING THE MUSE BUT LATELY COME TO ITALY FROM HER CLOUDY GRECIAN MOUNTAINS NOT TO THE CAPITAL THE PALATIA ROMANA
1913-147989-0006 BUT TO HIS OWN LITTLE COUNTRY TO HIS FATHER'S FIELDS SLOPING DOWN TO THE RIVER AND TO THE OLD BEECH TREES WITH BROKEN TOPS CLERIC SAID HE THOUGHT VIRGIL WHEN HE WAS DYING AT BRINDISI MUST HAVE REMEMBERED THAT PASSAGE
1913-147989-0007 CROWDED WITH FIGURES OF GODS AND MEN SHOULD BE BURNED RATHER THAN SURVIVE HIM UNPERFECTED THEN HIS MIND MUST HAVE GONE BACK TO THE PERFECT UTTERANCE OF THE GEORGICS WHERE THE PEN WAS FITTED TO THE MATTER AS THE PLOUGH IS TO THE FURROW
1913-147989-0008 AND HE MUST HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH THE THANKFULNESS OF A GOOD MAN I WAS THE FIRST TO BRING THE MUSE INTO MY COUNTRY WE LEFT THE CLASSROOM QUIETLY
1913-147989-0009 THOUGH PERHAPS I ALONE KNEW CLERIC INTIMATELY ENOUGH TO GUESS WHAT THAT FEELING WAS IN THE EVENING AS I SAT STARING AT MY BOOK THE FERVOR OF HIS VOICE STIRRED THROUGH THE QUANTITIES ON THE PAGE BEFORE ME
1913-147989-0010 I WAS WONDERING WHETHER THAT PARTICULAR ROCKY STRIP OF NEW ENGLAND COAST ABOUT WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN TOLD ME WAS CLERIC'S PATRIA BEFORE I HAD GOT FAR WITH MY READING I WAS DISTURBED BY A KNOCK I HURRIED TO THE DOOR AND WHEN I OPENED IT
1913-147989-0011 AND I BEHELD LENA LINGARD SHE WAS SO QUIETLY CONVENTIONALIZED BY CITY CLOTHES THAT I MIGHT HAVE PASSED HER ON THE STREET WITHOUT SEEING HER HER BLACK SUIT FITTED HER FIGURE SMOOTHLY AND A BLACK LACE HAT WITH PALE BLUE FORGET ME NOTS
1913-147989-0012 SAT DEMURELY ON HER YELLOW HAIR I LED HER TOWARD CLERIC'S CHAIR THE ONLY COMFORTABLE ONE I HAD QUESTIONING HER CONFUSEDLY SHE WAS NOT DISCONCERTED BY MY EMBARRASSMENT SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH THE NAIVE CURIOSITY I REMEMBERED SO WELL
1913-147989-0013 YOU ARE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE ARE N'T YOU I LIVE IN LINCOLN NOW TOO JIM I'M IN BUSINESS FOR MYSELF I HAVE A DRESSMAKING SHOP IN THE RALEIGH BLOCK OUT ON O STREET I'VE MADE A REAL GOOD START BUT LENA WHEN DID YOU COME OH I'VE BEEN HERE ALL WINTER

1913-147989-0015 SHE LAUGHED HER MELLOW EASY LAUGH THAT WAS EITHER VERY ARTLESS OR VERY COMPREHENDING ONE NEVER QUITE KNEW WHICH YOU SEEM THE SAME THOUGH EXCEPT YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN NOW OF COURSE DO YOU THINK I'VE CHANGED
1913-147989-0016 SHE TOOK OFF HER JACKET AND SAT MORE AT EASE IN HER BLOUSE OF SOME SOFT FLIMSY SILK SHE WAS ALREADY AT HOME IN MY PLACE HAD SLIPPED QUIETLY INTO IT AS SHE DID INTO EVERYTHING
1913-147989-0017 THIS SUMMER I'M GOING TO BUILD THE HOUSE FOR MOTHER I'VE TALKED ABOUT SO LONG I WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY UP ON IT AT FIRST BUT
1913-147989-0018 NEXT SUMMER I'LL TAKE HER DOWN NEW FURNITURE AND CARPETS SO SHE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO ALL WINTER I WATCHED LENA SITTING THERE SO SMOOTH AND SUNNY AND WELL CARED FOR AND THOUGHT OF HOW SHE USED TO RUN BAREFOOT OVER THE PRAIRIE UNTIL AFTER THE SNOW BEGAN TO FLY
1913-147989-0019 AND HOW CRAZY MARY CHASED HER ROUND AND ROUND THE CORNFIELDS IT SEEMED TO ME WONDERFUL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GOT ON SO WELL IN THE WORLD CERTAINLY SHE HAD NO ONE BUT HERSELF TO THANK FOR IT
1913-147989-0020 LOOK AT ME I'VE NEVER EARNED A DOLLAR AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO TONY SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO BE RICHER THAN MISTER HARLING SOME DAY SHE'S ALWAYS BRAGGING ABOUT YOU YOU KNOW TELL ME HOW IS TONY SHE'S FINE
1913-147989-0021 SHE WORKS FOR MISSUS GARDENER AT THE HOTEL NOW SHE'S HOUSEKEEPER MISSUS GARDENER'S HEALTH IS N'T WHAT IT WAS AND SHE CAN'T SEE AFTER EVERYTHING LIKE SHE USED TO
1913-147989-0022 OVERLOOKED THINGS IS SHE STILL GOING WITH LARRY DONOVAN OH THAT'S ON WORSE THAN EVER I GUESS THEY'RE ENGAGED TONY TALKS ABOUT HIM LIKE HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE RAILROAD EVERYBODY LAUGHS ABOUT IT BECAUSE SHE WAS NEVER A GIRL TO BE SOFT
1913-147989-0023 LENA'S FACE DIMPLED SOME OF US COULD TELL HER THINGS BUT IT WOULD N'T DO ANY GOOD SHE'D ALWAYS BELIEVE HIM THAT'S ANTONIA'S FAILING YOU KNOW IF SHE ONCE LIKES PEOPLE SHE WON'T HEAR ANYTHING AGAINST THEM
1913-147989-0024 I THINK I'D BETTER GO HOME AND LOOK AFTER ANTONIA I SAID I THINK YOU HAD
1913-147989-0025 IT'S A GOOD THING THE HARLINGS ARE FRIENDLY WITH HER AGAIN LARRY'S AFRAID OF THEM THEY SHIP SO MUCH GRAIN THEY HAVE INFLUENCE WITH THE RAILROAD PEOPLE WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING SHE LEANED HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND DREW MY BOOK TOWARD HER
1913-147989-0026 I CAUGHT A FAINT ODOR OF VIOLET SACHET SO THAT'S LATIN IS IT IT LOOKS HARD
1913-147989-0027 DON'T YOU JUST LOVE A GOOD PLAY JIM I CAN'T STAY AT HOME IN THE EVENING IF THERE'S ONE IN TOWN I'D BE WILLING TO WORK LIKE A SLAVE IT SEEMS TO ME TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE THEATERS LET'S GO TO A SHOW TOGETHER SOMETIME

1913-147989-0029 SHE BEGAN TO PUT ON HER WHITE GLOVES IT'S BEEN AWFUL GOOD TO SEE YOU JIM
1913-147989-0030 WE CAN TALK WHEN YOU COME TO SEE ME I EXPECT YOU DON'T OFTEN HAVE LADY VISITORS
1913-147989-0031 HOW SURPRISED MISSUS BURDEN WOULD BE LENA LAUGHED SOFTLY AS SHE ROSE
1913-147989-0032 NO I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO WITH ME I'M TO MEET SOME SWEDES AT THE DRUG STORE YOU WOULD N'T CARE FOR THEM I WANTED TO SEE YOUR ROOM SO I COULD WRITE TONY ALL ABOUT IT BUT I MUST TELL HER HOW I LEFT YOU RIGHT HERE WITH YOUR BOOKS SHE'S ALWAYS SO AFRAID SOME ONE WILL RUN OFF WITH YOU
1913-147989-0033 I WALKED WITH HER TO THE DOOR COME AND SEE ME SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE LONESOME BUT MAYBE YOU HAVE ALL THE FRIENDS YOU WANT HAVE YOU SHE TURNED HER SOFT CHEEK TO ME HAVE YOU SHE WHISPERED TEASINGLY IN MY EAR
1913-147989-0034 IN A MOMENT I WATCHED HER FADE DOWN THE DUSKY STAIRWAY WHEN I TURNED BACK TO MY ROOM THE PLACE SEEMED MUCH PLEASANTER THAN BEFORE LENA HAD LEFT SOMETHING WARM AND FRIENDLY IN THE LAMPLIGHT
1913-147989-0035 HOW I LOVED TO HEAR HER LAUGH AGAIN IT WAS SO SOFT AND UNEXCITED AND APPRECIATIVE GAVE A FAVORABLE INTERPRETATION TO EVERYTHING WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES I COULD HEAR THEM ALL LAUGHING
1913-147989-0036 THE DANISH LAUNDRY GIRLS AND THE THREE BOHEMIAN MARYS LENA HAD BROUGHT THEM ALL BACK TO ME IT CAME OVER ME AS IT HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE THE RELATION BETWEEN GIRLS LIKE THOSE AND THE POETRY OF VIRGIL
1913-147989-0037 IF THERE WERE NO GIRLS LIKE THEM IN THE WORLD THERE WOULD BE NO POETRY I UNDERSTOOD THAT CLEARLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS REVELATION SEEMED TO ME INESTIMABLY PRECIOUS I CLUNG TO IT AS IF IT MIGHT SUDDENLY VANISH
1913-147989-0038 AS I SAT DOWN TO MY BOOK AT LAST MY OLD DREAM ABOUT LENA COMING ACROSS THE HARVEST FIELD IN HER SHORT SKIRT SEEMED TO ME LIKE THE MEMORY OF AN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IT FLOATED BEFORE ME ON THE PAGE LIKE A PICTURE AND UNDERNEATH IT STOOD THE MOURNFUL LINE
