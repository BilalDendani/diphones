1769-143484-0000 DISCOURSE FIRST PART HOWEVER IMPORTANT IT MAY BE IN ORDER TO FORM A PROPER JUDGMENT OF THE NATURAL STATE OF MAN TO CONSIDER HIM FROM HIS ORIGIN AND TO EXAMINE HIM AS IT WERE IN THE FIRST EMBRYO OF THE SPECIES
1769-143484-0001 I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO TRACE HIS ORGANIZATION THROUGH ITS SUCCESSIVE APPROACHES TO PERFECTION I SHALL NOT STOP TO EXAMINE IN THE ANIMAL SYSTEM WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE BEGINNING TO BECOME AT LAST WHAT HE ACTUALLY IS
1769-143484-0002 DID NOT AT ONCE POINT OUT THE NATURE AND LIMITS OF HIS IDEAS I COULD ONLY FORM VAGUE AND ALMOST IMAGINARY CONJECTURES ON THIS SUBJECT COMPARATIVE ANATOMY HAS NOT AS YET BEEN SUFFICIENTLY IMPROVED
1769-143484-0003 IF I CONSIDER HIM IN A WORD SUCH AS HE MUST HAVE ISSUED FROM THE HANDS OF NATURE I SEE AN ANIMAL LESS STRONG THAN SOME AND LESS ACTIVE THAN OTHERS BUT UPON THE WHOLE THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUSLY ORGANIZED OF ANY
1769-143484-0004 I SEE HIM SATISFYING THE CALLS OF HUNGER UNDER THE FIRST OAK AND THOSE OF THIRST AT THE FIRST RIVULET I SEE HIM LAYING HIMSELF DOWN TO SLEEP AT THE FOOT OF THE SAME TREE THAT AFFORDED HIM HIS MEAL AND BEHOLD THIS DONE ALL HIS WANTS ARE COMPLETELY SUPPLIED
1769-143484-0005 AND LIVES EQUALLY UPON MOST OF THE DIFFERENT ALIMENTS WHICH THEY ONLY DIVIDE AMONG THEMSELVES A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH QUALIFIES HIM TO FIND HIS SUBSISTENCE WITH MORE EASE THAN ANY OF THEM MEN ACCUSTOMED FROM THEIR INFANCY TO THE INCLEMENCY OF THE WEATHER
1769-143484-0006 ACQUIRE A ROBUST AND ALMOST UNALTERABLE HABIT OF BODY THE CHILDREN BRINGING WITH THEM INTO THE WORLD THE EXCELLENT CONSTITUTION OF THEIR PARENTS AND STRENGTHENING IT BY THE SAME EXERCISES THAT FIRST PRODUCED IT
1769-143484-0007 ATTAIN BY THIS MEANS ALL THE VIGOUR THAT THE HUMAN FRAME IS CAPABLE OF NATURE TREATS THEM EXACTLY IN THE SAME MANNER THAT SPARTA TREATED THE CHILDREN OF HER CITIZENS THOSE WHO COME WELL FORMED INTO THE WORLD SHE RENDERS STRONG AND ROBUST AND DESTROYS ALL THE REST
1769-143484-0008 DIFFERING IN THIS RESPECT FROM OUR SOCIETIES IN WHICH THE STATE BY PERMITTING CHILDREN TO BECOME BURDENSOME TO THEIR PARENTS MURDERS THEM ALL WITHOUT DISTINCTION EVEN IN THE WOMBS OF THEIR MOTHERS THE BODY BEING THE ONLY INSTRUMENT THAT SAVAGE MAN IS ACQUAINTED WITH
1769-143484-0009 HAD HE A SLING WOULD IT DART A STONE TO SO GREAT A DISTANCE
1769-143484-0010 HAD HE A HORSE WOULD HE WITH SUCH SWIFTNESS SHOOT ALONG THE PLAIN GIVE CIVILIZED MAN BUT TIME TO GATHER ABOUT HIM ALL HIS MACHINES AND NO DOUBT HE WILL BE AN OVERMATCH FOR THE SAVAGE BUT IF YOU HAVE A MIND TO SEE A CONTEST STILL MORE UNEQUAL
1769-143484-0011 PLACE THEM NAKED AND UNARMED ONE OPPOSITE TO THE OTHER AND YOU WILL SOON DISCOVER THE ADVANTAGE THERE IS IN PERPETUALLY HAVING ALL OUR FORCES AT OUR DISPOSAL IN BEING CONSTANTLY PREPARED AGAINST ALL EVENTS
1769-143484-0012 AND IN ALWAYS CARRYING OURSELVES AS IT WERE WHOLE AND ENTIRE ABOUT US HOBBES WOULD HAVE IT THAT MAN IS NATURALLY VOID OF FEAR AND ALWAYS INTENT UPON ATTACKING AND FIGHTING AN ILLUSTRIOUS PHILOSOPHER THINKS ON THE CONTRARY AND CUMBERLAND AND PUFFENDORFF LIKEWISE AFFIRM IT
1769-143484-0013 THAT NOTHING IS MORE FEARFUL THAN MAN IN A STATE OF NATURE THAT HE IS ALWAYS IN A TREMBLE AND READY TO FLY AT THE FIRST MOTION HE PERCEIVES AT THE FIRST NOISE THAT STRIKES HIS EARS
1769-143484-0014 PROVIDED WITH STONES AND A GOOD STICK AND YOU WILL SOON FIND THAT THE DANGER IS AT LEAST EQUAL ON BOTH SIDES AND THAT AFTER SEVERAL TRIALS OF THIS KIND WILD BEASTS WHO ARE NOT FOND OF ATTACKING EACH OTHER WILL NOT BE VERY FOND OF ATTACKING MAN
1769-143484-0015 WHOM THEY HAVE FOUND EVERY WHIT AS WILD AS THEMSELVES AS TO ANIMALS WHO HAVE REALLY MORE STRENGTH THAN MAN HAS ADDRESS HE IS IN REGARD TO THEM WHAT OTHER WEAKER SPECIES ARE WHO FIND MEANS TO SUBSIST NOTWITHSTANDING
1769-143484-0016 HE HAS EVEN THIS GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER SUCH WEAKER SPECIES THAT BEING EQUALLY FLEET WITH THEM AND FINDING ON EVERY TREE AN ALMOST INVIOLABLE ASYLUM HE IS ALWAYS AT LIBERTY TO TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT AS HE LIKES BEST AND OF COURSE TO FIGHT OR TO FLY
1769-143484-0017 WHICH SEEM TO INDICATE THAT SOME PARTICULAR SPECIES ARE INTENDED BY NATURE FOR THE FOOD OF OTHERS BUT THERE ARE OTHER MORE FORMIDABLE ENEMIES AND AGAINST WHICH MAN IS NOT PROVIDED WITH THE SAME MEANS OF DEFENCE
1769-143484-0018 I MEAN NATURAL INFIRMITIES INFANCY OLD AGE AND SICKNESS OF EVERY KIND MELANCHOLY PROOFS OF OUR WEAKNESS WHEREOF THE TWO FIRST ARE COMMON TO ALL ANIMALS AND THE LAST CHIEFLY ATTENDS MAN LIVING IN A STATE OF SOCIETY
1769-143484-0019 ONE WAY TO LOOK OUT FOR THEIR OWN SUBSISTENCE AND ANOTHER TO SUCKLE AND FEED THEIR YOUNG ONES
1769-143484-0020 TRUE IT IS THAT IF THE WOMAN HAPPENS TO PERISH HER CHILD IS EXPOSED TO THE GREATEST DANGER OF PERISHING WITH HER BUT THIS DANGER IS COMMON TO A HUNDRED OTHER SPECIES WHOSE YOUNG ONES REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES
1769-143484-0021 SO THAT IN THIS RESPECT TOO ALL THINGS ARE IN A MANNER EQUAL
1769-143484-0022 AND THE NUMBER OF THE YOUNG OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO MY SUBJECT WITH OLD MEN WHO STIR AND PERSPIRE BUT LITTLE THE DEMAND FOR FOOD DIMINISHES WITH THEIR ABILITIES TO PROVIDE IT
1769-143484-0023 I SHALL ONLY ASK IF THERE ARE ANY SOLID OBSERVATIONS FROM WHICH WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE THE HEALING ART IS MOST NEGLECTED THE MEAN DURATION OF MAN'S LIFE IS SHORTER THAN IN THOSE WHERE IT IS MOST CULTIVATED
1769-143484-0024 AND THE WANT OF WHICH TEMPTS THEM EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERS TO EAT GREEDILY AND OVERLOAD THEIR STOMACHS WATCHINGS EXCESSES OF EVERY KIND IMMODERATE TRANSPORTS OF ALL THE PASSIONS FATIGUES WASTE OF SPIRITS
1769-143484-0025 AND WHICH THE MIND OF MAN IS CONSTANTLY A PREY TO THESE ARE THE FATAL PROOFS THAT MOST OF OUR ILLS ARE OF OUR OWN MAKING AND THAT WE MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THEM ALL BY ADHERING TO THE SIMPLE UNIFORM AND SOLITARY WAY OF LIFE PRESCRIBED TO US BY NATURE
1769-143484-0026 WE NEED ONLY CALL TO MIND THE GOOD CONSTITUTION OF SAVAGES OF THOSE AT LEAST WHOM WE HAVE NOT DESTROYED BY OUR STRONG LIQUORS WE NEED ONLY REFLECT THAT THEY ARE STRANGERS TO ALMOST EVERY DISEASE EXCEPT THOSE OCCASIONED BY WOUNDS AND OLD AGE
1769-143484-0027 AND WHOSE CURES WERE NOT THE LESS PERFECT FOR THEIR NOT HAVING BEEN TORTURED WITH INCISIONS POISONED WITH DRUGS OR WORN OUT BY DIET AND ABSTINENCE IN A WORD HOWEVER USEFUL MEDICINE WELL ADMINISTERED MAY BE TO US WHO LIVE IN A STATE OF SOCIETY
1769-143484-0028 THEY LOSE HALF THESE ADVANTAGES BY BECOMING DOMESTIC ANIMALS IT LOOKS AS IF ALL OUR ATTENTION TO TREAT THEM KINDLY AND TO FEED THEM WELL SERVED ONLY TO BASTARDIZE THEM IT IS THUS WITH MAN HIMSELF
1769-143484-0029 IN PROPORTION AS HE BECOMES SOCIABLE AND A SLAVE TO OTHERS HE BECOMES WEAK FEARFUL MEAN SPIRITED AND HIS SOFT AND EFFEMINATE WAY OF LIVING AT ONCE COMPLETES THE ENERVATION OF HIS STRENGTH AND OF HIS COURAGE
1769-143484-0030 WE MAY ADD THAT THERE MUST BE STILL A WIDER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IN A SAVAGE AND DOMESTIC CONDITION THAN BETWEEN BEAST AND BEAST
1769-143484-0031 ALL THE CONVENIENCES WITH WHICH MEN INDULGE THEMSELVES MORE THAN THEY DO THE BEASTS TAMED BY THEM ARE SO MANY PARTICULAR CAUSES WHICH MAKE THEM DEGENERATE MORE SENSIBLY
1769-143484-0032 ARE NOT SUCH MIGHTY EVILS IN RESPECT TO THESE PRIMITIVE MEN AND MUCH LESS STILL ANY OBSTACLE TO THEIR PRESERVATION THEIR SKINS IT IS TRUE ARE DESTITUTE OF HAIR BUT THEN THEY HAVE NO OCCASION FOR ANY SUCH COVERING IN WARM CLIMATES
1769-143484-0033 AND IN COLD CLIMATES THEY SOON LEARN TO APPLY TO THAT USE THOSE OF THE ANIMALS THEY HAVE CONQUERED
1769-143484-0034 AND PROVIDE FOR ALL THEIR WANTS
1769-143484-0035 BUT THE MOTHERS CARRY THEM WITH EASE AN ADVANTAGE NOT GRANTED TO OTHER SPECIES OF ANIMALS WITH WHOM THE MOTHER WHEN PURSUED IS OBLIGED TO ABANDON HER YOUNG ONES OR REGULATE HER STEPS BY THEIRS
1769-143484-0036 SINCE HE HAD LIVED WITHOUT THEM TILL THEN AND WHY SHOULD HE NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT IN HIS RIPER YEARS THE SAME KIND OF LIFE WHICH HE HAD SUPPORTED FROM HIS INFANCY ALONE IDLE AND ALWAYS SURROUNDED WITH DANGER
1769-143484-0037 SAVAGE MAN MUST BE FOND OF SLEEP AND SLEEP LIGHTLY LIKE OTHER ANIMALS WHO THINK BUT LITTLE AND MAY IN A MANNER BE SAID TO SLEEP ALL THE TIME THEY DO NOT THINK SELF PRESERVATION BEING ALMOST HIS ONLY CONCERN
1769-143484-0038 WHETHER TO SUBDUE HIS PREY OR TO PREVENT HIS BECOMING THAT OF OTHER ANIMALS
1769-143484-0039 UTTERLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH ALL MANNER OF DELICACY AND AS HIS SENSES ARE DIVIDED ON THIS POINT HIS TOUCH AND HIS TASTE MUST BE EXTREMELY COARSE AND BLUNT HIS SIGHT HIS HEARING AND HIS SMELLING EQUALLY SUBTLE
1769-143484-0040 SUCH IS THE ANIMAL STATE IN GENERAL AND ACCORDINGLY IF WE MAY BELIEVE TRAVELLERS IT IS THAT OF MOST SAVAGE NATIONS
