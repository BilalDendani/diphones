4345-7636-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR A STARTLING PROPOSITION THE MORE MIMI THOUGHT OVER THE LATE EVENTS THE MORE PUZZLED SHE WAS WHAT DID IT ALL MEAN WHAT COULD IT MEAN EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS AN ERROR OF FACT SOMEWHERE
4345-7636-0001 COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THEM ALL OF THEM HAD BEEN MISTAKEN THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO WHITE WORM AT ALL ON EITHER SIDE OF HER WAS A BELIEF IMPOSSIBLE OF RECEPTION NOT TO BELIEVE IN WHAT SEEMED APPARENT WAS TO DESTROY THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF BELIEF
4345-7636-0002 YET IN OLD DAYS THERE HAD BEEN MONSTERS ON THE EARTH AND CERTAINLY SOME PEOPLE HAD BELIEVED IN JUST SUCH MYSTERIOUS CHANGES OF IDENTITY IT WAS ALL VERY STRANGE JUST FANCY HOW ANY STRANGER SAY A DOCTOR
4345-7636-0003 WOULD REGARD HER IF SHE WERE TO TELL HIM THAT SHE HAD BEEN TO A TEA PARTY WITH AN ANTEDILUVIAN MONSTER
4345-7636-0004 ADAM HAD RETURNED EXHILARATED BY HIS WALK AND MORE SETTLED IN HIS MIND THAN HE HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME LIKE MIMI HE HAD GONE THROUGH THE PHASE OF DOUBT AND INABILITY TO BELIEVE IN THE REALITY OF THINGS THOUGH IT HAD NOT AFFECTED HIM TO THE SAME EXTENT
4345-7636-0005 THE IDEA HOWEVER THAT HIS WIFE WAS SUFFERING ILL EFFECTS FROM HER TERRIBLE ORDEAL BRACED HIM UP HE REMAINED WITH HER FOR A TIME THEN HE SOUGHT SIR NATHANIEL IN ORDER TO TALK OVER THE MATTER WITH HIM
4345-7636-0006 HE KNEW THAT THE CALM COMMON SENSE AND SELF RELIANCE OF THE OLD MAN AS WELL AS HIS EXPERIENCE WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THEM ALL SIR NATHANIEL HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT FOR SOME REASON WHICH HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND LADY ARABELLA HAD CHANGED HER PLANS
4345-7636-0007 AND FOR THE PRESENT AT ALL EVENTS WAS PACIFIC HE WAS INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE HER CHANGED DEMEANOUR TO THE FACT THAT HER INFLUENCE OVER EDGAR CASWALL WAS SO FAR INCREASED AS TO JUSTIFY A MORE FIXED BELIEF IN HIS SUBMISSION TO HER CHARMS
4345-7636-0008 SHE HAD SEEN CASWALL THAT MORNING WHEN SHE VISITED CASTRA REGIS
4345-7636-0009 CASWALL WITHOUT BEING ENTHUSIASTIC ON THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN COURTEOUS AND ATTENTIVE AS SHE HAD WALKED BACK TO DIANA'S GROVE SHE ALMOST CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON HER NEW SETTLEMENT IN LIFE THAT THE IDEA WAS BECOMING FIXED IN HER MIND
4345-7636-0010 WAS SHOWN BY A LETTER WHICH SHE WROTE LATER IN THE DAY TO ADAM SALTON AND SENT TO HIM BY HAND IT RAN AS FOLLOWS
4345-7636-0011 I WONDER IF YOU WOULD KINDLY ADVISE AND IF POSSIBLE HELP ME IN A MATTER OF BUSINESS I HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME TRYING TO MAKE UP MY MIND TO SELL DIANA'S GROVE I HAVE PUT OFF AND PUT OFF THE DOING OF IT TILL NOW
4345-7636-0012 THE PLACE IS MY OWN PROPERTY AND NO ONE HAS TO BE CONSULTED WITH REGARD TO WHAT I MAY WISH TO DO ABOUT IT IT WAS BOUGHT BY MY LATE HUSBAND CAPTAIN ADOLPHUS RANGER MARCH WHO HAD ANOTHER RESIDENCE THE CREST APPLEBY
4345-7636-0013 HE ACQUIRED ALL RIGHTS OF ALL KINDS INCLUDING MINING AND SPORTING WHEN HE DIED HE LEFT HIS WHOLE PROPERTY TO ME I SHALL FEEL LEAVING THIS PLACE WHICH HAS BECOME ENDEARED TO ME BY MANY SACRED MEMORIES AND AFFECTIONS
4345-7636-0014 THE RECOLLECTION OF MANY HAPPY DAYS OF MY YOUNG MARRIED LIFE AND THE MORE THAN HAPPY MEMORIES OF THE MAN I LOVED AND WHO LOVED ME SO MUCH I SHOULD BE WILLING TO SELL THE PLACE FOR ANY FAIR PRICE SO LONG OF COURSE
4345-7636-0015 AS THE PURCHASER WAS ONE I LIKED AND OF WHOM I APPROVED MAY I SAY THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD BE THE IDEAL PERSON BUT I DARE NOT HOPE FOR SO MUCH IT STRIKES ME HOWEVER THAT AMONG YOUR AUSTRALIAN FRIENDS
4345-7636-0016 MAY BE SOMEONE WHO WISHES TO MAKE A SETTLEMENT IN THE OLD COUNTRY AND WOULD CARE TO FIX THE SPOT IN ONE OF THE MOST HISTORIC REGIONS IN ENGLAND FULL OF ROMANCE AND LEGEND AND WITH A NEVER ENDING VISTA OF HISTORICAL INTEREST AN ESTATE WHICH THOUGH SMALL
4345-7636-0017 IS IN PERFECT CONDITION AND WITH ILLIMITABLE POSSIBILITIES OF DEVELOPMENT AND MANY DOUBTFUL OR UNSETTLED RIGHTS WHICH HAVE EXISTED BEFORE THE TIME OF THE ROMANS OR EVEN CELTS WHO WERE THE ORIGINAL POSSESSORS IN ADDITION
4345-7636-0018 IMMEDIATE POSSESSION CAN BE ARRANGED MY LAWYERS CAN PROVIDE YOU OR WHOEVER YOU MAY SUGGEST WITH ALL BUSINESS AND HISTORICAL DETAILS
4345-7636-0019 AND WE CAN LEAVE DETAILS TO BE THRASHED OUT BY OUR AGENTS FORGIVE ME WON'T YOU FOR TROUBLING YOU IN THE MATTER AND BELIEVE ME YOURS VERY SINCERELY ARABELLA MARCH ADAM READ THIS OVER SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN HIS MIND BEING MADE UP
4345-7636-0020 HE WENT TO MIMI AND ASKED IF SHE HAD ANY OBJECTION SHE ANSWERED AFTER A SHUDDER THAT SHE WAS IN THIS AS IN ALL THINGS WILLING TO DO WHATEVER HE MIGHT WISH
4345-7636-0021 BE QUITE FREE TO ACT AS YOU SEE YOUR DUTY AND AS YOUR INCLINATION CALLS WE ARE IN THE HANDS OF GOD AND HE HAS HITHERTO GUIDED US AND WILL DO SO TO HIS OWN END FROM HIS WIFE'S ROOM ADAM SALTON WENT STRAIGHT TO THE STUDY IN THE TOWER
4345-7636-0022 WHERE HE KNEW SIR NATHANIEL WOULD BE AT THAT HOUR THE OLD MAN WAS ALONE SO WHEN HE HAD ENTERED IN OBEDIENCE TO THE COME IN WHICH ANSWERED HIS QUERY HE CLOSED THE DOOR AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM DO YOU THINK SIR
4345-7636-0023 THAT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR ME TO BUY DIANA'S GROVE GOD BLESS MY SOUL SAID THE OLD MAN STARTLED
4345-7636-0024 WELL I HAVE VOWED TO DESTROY THAT WHITE WORM AND MY BEING ABLE TO DO WHATEVER I MAY CHOOSE WITH THE LAIR WOULD FACILITATE MATTERS AND AVOID COMPLICATIONS SIR NATHANIEL HESITATED LONGER THAN USUAL BEFORE SPEAKING HE WAS THINKING DEEPLY
4345-7636-0025 YES ADAM THERE IS MUCH COMMON SENSE IN YOUR SUGGESTION THOUGH IT STARTLED ME AT FIRST I THINK THAT FOR ALL REASONS YOU WOULD DO WELL TO BUY THE PROPERTY AND TO HAVE THE CONVEYANCE SETTLED AT ONCE IF YOU WANT MORE MONEY THAN IS IMMEDIATELY CONVENIENT
4345-7636-0026 LET ME KNOW SO THAT I MAY BE YOUR BANKER THANK YOU SIR MOST HEARTILY BUT I HAVE MORE MONEY AT IMMEDIATE CALL THAN I SHALL WANT I AM GLAD YOU APPROVE THE PROPERTY IS HISTORIC AND AS TIME GOES ON IT WILL INCREASE IN VALUE
4345-7636-0027 MOREOVER I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING WHICH INDEED IS ONLY A SURMISE BUT WHICH IF I AM RIGHT WILL ADD GREAT VALUE TO THE PLACE ADAM LISTENED HAS IT EVER STRUCK YOU WHY THE OLD NAME THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM WAS GIVEN
4345-7636-0028 WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A SNAKE WHICH IN EARLY DAYS WAS CALLED A WORM BUT WHY WHITE I REALLY DON'T KNOW SIR I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT I SIMPLY TOOK IT FOR GRANTED SO DID I AT FIRST LONG AGO
4345-7636-0029 BUT LATER I PUZZLED MY BRAIN FOR A REASON AND WHAT WAS THE REASON SIR SIMPLY AND SOLELY BECAUSE THE SNAKE OR WORM WAS WHITE WE ARE NEAR THE COUNTY OF STAFFORD WHERE THE GREAT INDUSTRY OF CHINA BURNING WAS ORIGINATED AND GREW
4345-7636-0030 STAFFORD OWES MUCH OF ITS WEALTH TO THE LARGE DEPOSITS OF THE RARE CHINA CLAY FOUND IN IT FROM TIME TO TIME THESE DEPOSITS BECOME IN TIME PRETTY WELL EXHAUSTED BUT FOR CENTURIES STAFFORD ADVENTURERS LOOKED FOR THE SPECIAL CLAY
4345-7636-0031 AS OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA FARMERS AND EXPLORERS LOOKED FOR OIL ANYONE OWNING REAL ESTATE ON WHICH CHINA CLAY CAN BE DISCOVERED STRIKES A SORT OF GOLD MINE YES AND THEN THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED PUZZLED
4345-7636-0032 THE ORIGINAL WORM SO CALLED FROM WHICH THE NAME OF THE PLACE CAME
4345-7636-0033 NOW THE CLAY IS EASILY PENETRABLE AND THE ORIGINAL HOLE PROBABLY PIERCED A BED OF CHINA CLAY WHEN ONCE THE WAY WAS MADE IT WOULD BECOME A SORT OF HIGHWAY FOR THE WORM BUT AS MUCH MOVEMENT WAS NECESSARY TO ASCEND SUCH A GREAT HEIGHT
4345-7636-0034 SOME OF THE CLAY WOULD BECOME ATTACHED TO ITS ROUGH SKIN BY ATTRITION THE DOWNWAY MUST HAVE BEEN EASY WORK BUT THE ASCENT WAS DIFFERENT AND WHEN THE MONSTER CAME TO VIEW IN THE UPPER WORLD IT WOULD BE FRESH FROM CONTACT WITH THE WHITE CLAY HENCE THE NAME
4345-7636-0035 WHICH HAS NO CRYPTIC SIGNIFICANCE BUT ONLY FACT NOW IF THAT SURMISE BE TRUE AND I DO NOT SEE WHY NOT THERE MUST BE A DEPOSIT OF VALUABLE CLAY POSSIBLY OF IMMENSE DEPTH ADAM'S COMMENT PLEASED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
4345-7636-0036 I HAVE IT IN MY BONES SIR THAT YOU HAVE STRUCK OR RATHER REASONED OUT A GREAT TRUTH SIR NATHANIEL WENT ON CHEERFULLY
4345-7636-0037 IT WILL BE AS WELL THAT YOUR TITLE TO OWNERSHIP HAS BEEN PERFECTLY SECURED IF ANYONE EVER DESERVED SUCH A GAIN IT IS YOU WITH HIS FRIEND'S AID ADAM SECURED THE PROPERTY WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME THEN HE WENT TO SEE HIS UNCLE AND TOLD HIM ABOUT IT
4345-7636-0038 MISTER SALTON WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND HIS YOUNG RELATIVE ALREADY CONSTRUCTIVELY THE OWNER OF SO FINE AN ESTATE ONE WHICH GAVE HIM AN IMPORTANT STATUS IN THE COUNTY HE MADE MANY ANXIOUS ENQUIRIES ABOUT MIMI AND THE DOINGS OF THE WHITE WORM BUT ADAM REASSURED HIM
4345-7636-0039 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN ADAM WENT TO HIS HOST IN THE SMOKING ROOM SIR NATHANIEL ASKED HIM HOW HE PURPOSED TO PROCEED WITH REGARD TO KEEPING HIS VOW
4345-7636-0040 TO DESTROY SUCH A MONSTER IS SOMETHING LIKE ONE OF THE LABOURS OF HERCULES IN THAT NOT ONLY ITS SIZE AND WEIGHT AND POWER OF USING THEM IN LITTLE KNOWN WAYS ARE AGAINST YOU BUT THE OCCULT SIDE IS ALONE AN UNSURPASSABLE DIFFICULTY
4345-7636-0041 THE WORM IS ALREADY MASTER OF ALL THE ELEMENTS EXCEPT FIRE AND I DO NOT SEE HOW FIRE CAN BE USED FOR THE ATTACK IT HAS ONLY TO SINK INTO THE EARTH IN ITS USUAL WAY AND YOU COULD NOT OVERTAKE IT IF YOU HAD THE RESOURCES OF THE BIGGEST COAL MINE IN EXISTENCE
4345-7636-0042 BUT I DARESAY YOU HAVE MAPPED OUT SOME PLAN IN YOUR MIND HE ADDED COURTEOUSLY I HAVE SIR BUT OF COURSE IT MAY NOT STAND THE TEST OF PRACTICE MAY I KNOW THE IDEA WELL SIR THIS WAS MY ARGUMENT
4345-7636-0043 AT THE TIME OF THE CHARTIST TROUBLE AN IDEA SPREAD AMONGST FINANCIAL CIRCLES THAT AN ATTACK WAS GOING TO BE MADE ON THE BANK OF ENGLAND ACCORDINGLY THE DIRECTORS OF THAT INSTITUTION CONSULTED MANY PERSONS WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN
4345-7636-0044 AND IT WAS FINALLY DECIDED THAT THE BEST PROTECTION AGAINST FIRE WHICH IS WHAT WAS FEARED WAS NOT WATER BUT SAND TO CARRY THE SCHEME INTO PRACTICE GREAT STORE OF FINE SEA SAND THE KIND THAT BLOWS ABOUT AND IS USED TO FILL HOUR GLASSES
4345-7636-0045 WAS PROVIDED THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING ESPECIALLY AT THE POINTS LIABLE TO ATTACK FROM WHICH IT COULD BE BROUGHT INTO USE
4345-7636-0046 AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SUCH SAND
4345-7636-0047 WHICH IT WILL IN TIME CHOKE THUS LADY ARABELLA IN HER GUISE OF THE WHITE WORM WILL FIND HERSELF CUT OFF FROM HER REFUGE THE HOLE IS A NARROW ONE AND IS SOME HUNDREDS OF FEET DEEP THE WEIGHT OF THE SAND THIS CAN CONTAIN WOULD NOT IN ITSELF BE SUFFICIENT TO OBSTRUCT
4345-7636-0048 BUT THE FRICTION OF SUCH A BODY WORKING UP AGAINST IT WOULD BE TREMENDOUS ONE MOMENT WHAT USE WOULD THE SAND BE FOR DESTRUCTION NONE DIRECTLY BUT IT WOULD HOLD THE STRUGGLING BODY IN PLACE TILL THE REST OF MY SCHEME CAME INTO PRACTICE AND WHAT IS THE REST
4345-7636-0049 GOOD BUT HOW WOULD THE DYNAMITE EXPLODE FOR OF COURSE THAT IS WHAT YOU INTEND
4345-7636-0050 THAT WAS PROVED IN NEW YORK A THOUSAND POUNDS OF DYNAMITE IN SEALED CANISTERS WAS PLACED ABOUT SOME WORKINGS AT THE LAST A CHARGE OF GUNPOWDER WAS FIRED AND THE CONCUSSION EXPLODED THE DYNAMITE IT WAS MOST SUCCESSFUL
4345-7636-0051 THOSE WHO WERE NON EXPERTS IN HIGH EXPLOSIVES EXPECTED THAT EVERY PANE OF GLASS IN NEW YORK WOULD BE SHATTERED BUT IN REALITY THE EXPLOSIVE DID NO HARM OUTSIDE THE AREA INTENDED ALTHOUGH SIXTEEN ACRES OF ROCK HAD BEEN MINED
4345-7636-0052 AND ONLY THE SUPPORTING WALLS AND PILLARS HAD BEEN LEFT INTACT THE WHOLE OF THE ROCKS WERE SHATTERED SIR NATHANIEL NODDED APPROVAL
4345-7636-0053 A VERY EXCELLENT ONE BUT IF IT HAS TO TEAR DOWN SO MANY FEET OF PRECIPICE IT MAY WRECK THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD
