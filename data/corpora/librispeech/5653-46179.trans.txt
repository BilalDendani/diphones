5653-46179-0000 BACHELOR'S QUARTERS HORACE WAS FEELING PARTICULARLY HAPPY AS HE WALKED BACK THE NEXT EVENING TO VINCENT SQUARE HE HAD THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING DONE A GOOD DAY'S WORK
5653-46179-0001 FOR THE SKETCH PLANS FOR MISTER WACKERBATH'S MANSION WERE ACTUALLY COMPLETED AND DESPATCHED TO HIS BUSINESS ADDRESS WHILE VENTIMORE NOW FELT A COMFORTABLE ASSURANCE THAT HIS DESIGNS WOULD MORE THAN SATISFY HIS CLIENT
5653-46179-0002 BUT IT WAS NOT THAT WHICH MADE HIM SO LIGHT OF HEART THAT NIGHT HIS ROOMS WERE TO BE HONOURED FOR THE FIRST TIME BY SYLVIA'S PRESENCE SHE WOULD TREAD UPON HIS CARPET SIT IN HIS CHAIRS COMMENT UPON AND PERHAPS EVEN HANDLE
5653-46179-0003 HIS BOOKS AND ORNAMENTS AND ALL OF THEM WOULD RETAIN SOMETHING OF HER CHARM FOR EVER AFTER
5653-46179-0004 FOR EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT QUITE BELIEVE THAT SHE REALLY WOULD THAT SOME UNTOWARD EVENT WOULD NOT MAKE A POINT OF HAPPENING TO PREVENT HER AS HE SOMETIMES DOUBTED WHETHER HIS ENGAGEMENT WAS NOT TOO SWEET AND WONDERFUL TO BE TRUE OR AT ALL EVENTS TO LAST
5653-46179-0005 AS TO THE DINNER HIS MIND WAS TOLERABLY EASY FOR HE HAD SETTLED THE REMAINING DETAILS OF THE MENU WITH HIS LANDLADY THAT MORNING AND HE COULD HOPE THAT WITHOUT BEING SO SUMPTUOUS AS TO EXCITE THE PROFESSOR'S WRATH IT WOULD STILL BE NOT ALTOGETHER UNWORTHY
5653-46179-0006 AND WHAT GOODS COULD BE RARE AND DAINTY ENOUGH TO BE SET BEFORE SYLVIA HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO PROVIDE CHAMPAGNE BUT HE KNEW THAT WINE WOULD SAVOUR OF OSTENTATION IN THE PROFESSOR'S JUDGMENT SO HE HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF INSTEAD WITH CLARET
5653-46179-0007 A SOUND VINTAGE WHICH HE KNEW HE COULD DEPEND UPON FLOWERS HE THOUGHT WERE CLEARLY PERMISSIBLE AND HE HAD CALLED AT A FLORIST'S ON HIS WAY AND GOT SOME CHRYSANTHEMUMS OF PALEST YELLOW AND DEEPEST TERRA COTTA THE FINEST HE COULD SEE
5653-46179-0008 SOME OF THEM WOULD LOOK WELL ON THE CENTRE OF THE TABLE IN AN OLD NANKIN BLUE AND WHITE BOWL HE HAD THE REST HE COULD ARRANGE ABOUT THE ROOM
5653-46179-0009 OCCUPIED WITH THESE THOUGHTS HE TURNED INTO VINCENT SQUARE WHICH LOOKED VASTER THAN EVER WITH THE MURKY HAZE ENCLOSED BY ITS HIGH RAILINGS AND UNDER A WIDE EXPANSE OF STEEL BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH THE CLOUDS WERE DRIVING FAST LIKE SHIPS IN FULL SAIL
5653-46179-0010 AGAINST THE MIST BELOW THE YOUNG AND NEARLY LEAFLESS TREES SHOWED FLAT BLACK PROFILES AS OF PRESSED SEAWEED
5653-46179-0011 FROM THE RIVER CAME THE LONG DRAWN TOOTING OF TUGS MINGLED WITH THE MORE DISTANT WAIL AND HYSTERICAL SHRIEKS OF RAILWAY ENGINES ON THE LAMBETH LINES AND NOW HE REACHED THE OLD SEMI DETACHED HOUSE IN WHICH HE LODGED
5653-46179-0012 AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW THE TRELLIS WORK OF THE VERANDA MADE WITH THE BARED CREEPERS AND HANGING BASKETS A KIND OF DECORATIVE PATTERN AGAINST THE WINDOWS WHICH WERE SUFFUSED WITH A ROSEATE GLOW THAT LOOKED WARM AND COMFORTABLE AND HOSPITABLE
5653-46179-0013 HE WONDERED WHETHER SYLVIA WOULD NOTICE IT WHEN SHE ARRIVED
5653-46179-0014 THEN HE LET HIMSELF IN AND STOOD SPELLBOUND WITH PERPLEXED AMAZEMENT FOR HE WAS IN A STRANGE HOUSE IN PLACE OF THE MODEST PASSAGE WITH THE YELLOW MARBLE WALL PAPER THE MAHOGANY HAT STAND
5653-46179-0015 AND THE ELDERLY BAROMETER IN A STATE OF CHRONIC DEPRESSION WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL HE FOUND AN ARCHED OCTAGONAL ENTRANCE HALL WITH ARABESQUES OF BLUE CRIMSON AND GOLD AND RICHLY EMBROIDERED HANGINGS THE FLOOR WAS MARBLE
5653-46179-0016 AND FROM A SHALLOW BASIN OF ALABASTER IN THE CENTRE A PERFUMED FOUNTAIN ROSE AND FELL WITH A LULLING PATTER I MUST HAVE MISTAKEN THE NUMBER HE THOUGHT QUITE FORGETTING THAT HIS LATCH KEY HAD FITTED
5653-46179-0017 AND HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO RETREAT BEFORE HIS INTRUSION WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE HANGINGS PARTED
5653-46179-0018 WHATEVER WILL YOU GO AND DO NEXT I WONDER TO THINK OF YOUR GOING AND HAVING THE WHOLE PLACE DONE UP AND ALTERED OUT OF KNOWLEDGE LIKE THIS WITHOUT A WORD OF WARNING IF ANY HALTERATIONS WERE REQUIRED I DO THINK AS ME AND RAPKIN HAD THE RIGHT TO BE CONSULTED
5653-46179-0019 HORACE LET ALL HIS CHRYSANTHEMUMS DROP UNHEEDED INTO THE FOUNTAIN HE UNDERSTOOD NOW INDEED HE SEEMED IN SOME WAY TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD ALMOST FROM THE FIRST ONLY HE WOULD NOT ADMIT IT EVEN TO HIMSELF
5653-46179-0020 THE IRREPRESSIBLE JINNEE WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS OF COURSE HE REMEMBERED NOW HAVING MADE THAT UNFORTUNATE REMARK THE DAY BEFORE ABOUT THE LIMITED ACCOMMODATION HIS ROOMS AFFORDED
5653-46179-0021 AND WITH THAT INSATIABLE MUNIFICENCE WHICH WAS ONE OF HIS WORST FAILINGS HAD DETERMINED BY WAY OF A PLEASANT SURPRISE TO ENTIRELY REFURNISH AND REDECORATE THE APARTMENTS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN IDEAS IT WAS EXTREMELY KIND OF HIM
5653-46179-0022 IT SHOWED A TRULY GRATEFUL DISPOSITION BUT OH AS HORACE THOUGHT IN THE BITTERNESS OF HIS SOUL IF HE WOULD ONLY LEARN TO LET WELL ALONE AND MIND HIS OWN BUSINESS
5653-46179-0023 HOWEVER THE THING WAS DONE NOW AND HE MUST ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT SINCE HE COULD HARDLY DISCLOSE THE TRUTH DIDN'T I MENTION I WAS HAVING SOME ALTERATIONS MADE HE SAID CARELESSLY THEY'VE GOT THE WORK DONE RATHER SOONER THAN I EXPECTED WERE
5653-46179-0024 WERE THEY LONG OVER IT I'M SURE I CAN'T TELL YOU SIR HAVING STEPPED OUT TO GET SOME THINGS I WANTED IN FOR TO NIGHT AND RAPKIN HE WAS ROUND THE CORNER AT HIS READING ROOM AND WHEN I COME BACK IT WAS ALL DONE AND THE WORKMEN GONE OME
5653-46179-0025 AND HOW THEY COULD HAVE FINISHED SUCH A JOB IN THE TIME BEATS ME ALTOGETHER FOR WHEN WE AD THE MEN IN TO DO THE BACK KITCHEN THEY TOOK TEN DAYS OVER IT WELL SAID HORACE EVADING THIS POINT HOWEVER THEY'VE DONE THIS THEY'VE DONE IT REMARKABLY WELL
5653-46179-0026 YOU'LL ADMIT THAT MISSUS RAPKIN THAT'S AS MAY BE SIR
5653-46179-0027 NOR YET I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE RAPKIN'S TASTE WHEN HE COMES TO SEE IT IT WAS NOT VENTIMORE'S TASTE EITHER THOUGH HE WAS NOT GOING TO CONFESS IT SORRY FOR THAT MISSUS RAPKIN HE SAID
5653-46179-0028 BEGGING YOUR PARDON SIR BUT THAT'S A TOTAL UNPOSSIBILITY FOR THEY'VE BEEN AND TOOK AWAY THE STAIRCASE TAKEN AWAY THE STAIRCASE NONSENSE CRIED HORACE SO I THINK MISTER VENTIMORE
5653-46179-0029 FROM WHICH HUNG SEVERAL LAMPS DIFFUSING A SUBDUED RADIANCE HIGH UP IN THE WALL ON HIS LEFT WERE THE TWO WINDOWS WHICH HE JUDGED TO HAVE FORMERLY BELONGED TO HIS SITTING ROOM FOR EITHER FROM DELICACY OR INABILITY OR SIMPLY BECAUSE IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM
5653-46179-0030 THE JINNEE HAD NOT INTERFERED WITH THE EXTERNAL STRUCTURE BUT THE WINDOWS WERE NOW MASKED BY A PERFORATED AND GILDED LATTICE WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE PATTERN HORACE HAD NOTICED FROM WITHOUT THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH BLUE AND WHITE ORIENTAL TILES
5653-46179-0031 THE CENTRE OF THE MARBLE FLOOR WAS SPREAD WITH COSTLY RUGS AND PILES OF CUSHIONS THEIR RICH HUES GLOWING THROUGH THE GOLD WITH WHICH THEY WERE INTRICATELY EMBROIDERED WELL SAID THE UNHAPPY HORACE SCARCELY KNOWING WHAT HE WAS SAYING

5653-46179-0034 NOW I MUST BE OFF AND DRESS HE GOT RID OF HER AND ON ENTERING ONE OF THE ARCHWAYS DISCOVERED A SMALLER ROOM
5653-46179-0035 WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY HIS BEDROOM A GORGEOUS ROBE
5653-46179-0036 BUT VENTIMORE NATURALLY PREFERRED HIS OWN EVENING CLOTHES MISTER RAPKIN HE SHOUTED GOING TO ANOTHER ARCH THAT SEEMED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE BASEMENT SIR REPLIED HIS LANDLORD WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM HIS READING ROOM
