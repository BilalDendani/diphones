6540-62512-0000 THE CAVE WAS THUS DIVIDED INTO THREE OR FOUR ROOMS IF SUCH DARK DENS WITH WHICH A DONKEY WOULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN CONTENTED DESERVED THE NAME BUT THEY WERE DRY AND THERE WAS SPACE TO STAND UPRIGHT AT LEAST IN THE PRINCIPAL ROOM WHICH OCCUPIED THE CENTER
6540-62512-0001 THE FLOOR WAS COVERED WITH FINE SAND AND TAKING ALL IN ALL THEY WERE WELL PLEASED WITH IT FOR WANT OF A BETTER PERHAPS SAID HERBERT WHILE HE AND PENCROFT WERE WORKING
6540-62512-0002 VERY LIKELY REPLIED THE SEAMAN
6540-62512-0003 BETTER TO HAVE TWO STRINGS TO ONE'S BOW THAN NO STRING AT ALL OH EXCLAIMED HERBERT HOW JOLLY IT WILL BE IF THEY WERE TO FIND CAPTAIN HARDING AND WERE TO BRING HIM BACK WITH THEM YES INDEED SAID PENCROFT THAT WAS A MAN OF THE RIGHT SORT WAS EXCLAIMED HERBERT
6540-62512-0004 DO YOU DESPAIR OF EVER SEEING HIM AGAIN GOD FORBID REPLIED THE SAILOR THEIR WORK WAS SOON DONE AND PENCROFT DECLARED HIMSELF VERY WELL SATISFIED NOW SAID HE OUR FRIENDS CAN COME BACK WHEN THEY LIKE THEY WILL FIND A GOOD ENOUGH SHELTER
6540-62512-0005 THEY NOW HAD ONLY TO MAKE A FIREPLACE AND TO PREPARE THE SUPPER AN EASY TASK
6540-62512-0006 THIS IF THE SMOKE DID NOT TAKE THE HEAT OUT WITH IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN AN EQUAL TEMPERATURE INSIDE THEIR WOOD WAS STOWED AWAY IN ONE OF THE ROOMS AND THE SAILOR LAID IN THE FIREPLACE SOME LOGS AND BRUSHWOOD THE SEAMAN WAS BUSY WITH THIS WHEN HERBERT ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANY MATCHES
6540-62512-0007 CERTAINLY REPLIED PENCROFT AND I MAY SAY HAPPILY FOR WITHOUT MATCHES OR TINDER WE SHOULD BE IN A FIX STILL WE MIGHT GET FIRE AS THE SAVAGES DO REPLIED HERBERT BY RUBBING TWO BITS OF DRY STICK ONE AGAINST THE OTHER
6540-62512-0008 WELL IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PROCEEDING AND MUCH USED IN THE ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC I DON'T DENY IT REPLIED PENCROFT BUT THE SAVAGES MUST KNOW HOW TO DO IT OR EMPLOY A PECULIAR WOOD FOR MORE THAN ONCE I HAVE TRIED TO GET FIRE IN THAT WAY BUT I COULD NEVER MANAGE IT
6540-62512-0009 I MUST SAY I PREFER MATCHES BY THE BYE WHERE ARE MY MATCHES
6540-62512-0010 WHICH WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HE WAS A CONFIRMED SMOKER HE COULD NOT FIND IT HE RUMMAGED THE POCKETS OF HIS TROUSERS BUT TO HIS HORROR HE COULD NOWHERE DISCOVER THE BOX HERE'S A GO SAID HE LOOKING AT HERBERT
6540-62512-0011 SURELY HERBERT YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING A TINDER BOX ANYTHING THAT CAN POSSIBLY MAKE FIRE NO I HAVEN'T PENCROFT THE SAILOR RUSHED OUT FOLLOWED BY THE BOY
6540-62512-0012 ON THE SAND AMONG THE ROCKS NEAR THE RIVER'S BANK THEY BOTH SEARCHED CAREFULLY BUT IN VAIN THE BOX WAS OF COPPER AND THEREFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY SEEN PENCROFT ASKED HERBERT DIDN'T YOU THROW IT OUT OF THE CAR
6540-62512-0013 I KNEW BETTER THAN THAT REPLIED THE SAILOR BUT SUCH A SMALL ARTICLE COULD EASILY DISAPPEAR IN THE TUMBLING ABOUT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH I WOULD RATHER EVEN HAVE LOST MY PIPE CONFOUND THE BOX WHERE CAN IT BE LOOK HERE THE TIDE IS GOING DOWN SAID HERBERT
6540-62512-0014 LET'S RUN TO THE PLACE WHERE WE LANDED IT WAS SCARCELY PROBABLE THAT THEY WOULD FIND THE BOX WHICH THE WAVES HAD ROLLED ABOUT AMONG THE PEBBLES AT HIGH TIDE BUT IT WAS AS WELL TO TRY HERBERT AND PENCROFT WALKED RAPIDLY TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD LANDED THE DAY BEFORE
6540-62512-0015 ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET FROM THE CAVE THEY HUNTED THERE AMONG THE SHINGLE IN THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCKS BUT FOUND NOTHING IF THE BOX HAD FALLEN AT THIS PLACE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE WAVES AS THE SEA WENT DOWN
6540-62512-0016 THEY SEARCHED EVERY LITTLE CREVICE WITH NO RESULT IT WAS A GRAVE LOSS IN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND FOR THE TIME IRREPARABLE PENCROFT COULD NOT HIDE HIS VEXATION HE LOOKED VERY ANXIOUS BUT SAID NOT A WORD
6540-62512-0017 HERBERT TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM BY OBSERVING THAT IF THEY HAD FOUND THE MATCHES THEY WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE BEEN WETTED BY THE SEA AND USELESS NO MY BOY REPLIED THE SAILOR THEY WERE IN A COPPER BOX WHICH SHUT VERY TIGHTLY AND NOW WHAT ARE WE TO DO
6540-62512-0018 WE SHALL CERTAINLY FIND SOME WAY OF MAKING A FIRE SAID HERBERT CAPTAIN HARDING OR MISTER SPILETT WILL NOT BE WITHOUT THEM YES REPLIED PENCROFT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE WITHOUT FIRE
6540-62512-0019 AND OUR COMPANIONS WILL FIND BUT A SORRY REPAST ON THEIR RETURN BUT SAID HERBERT QUICKLY DO YOU THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY HAVE NO TINDER OR MATCHES I DOUBT IT REPLIED THE SAILOR SHAKING HIS HEAD
6540-62512-0020 AND I BELIEVE THAT MISTER SPILETT WOULD RATHER KEEP HIS NOTE BOOK THAN HIS MATCH BOX HERBERT DID NOT REPLY THE LOSS OF THE BOX WAS CERTAINLY TO BE REGRETTED BUT THE BOY WAS STILL SURE OF PROCURING FIRE IN SOME WAY OR OTHER PENCROFT MORE EXPERIENCED DID NOT THINK SO
6540-62512-0021 ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT A MAN TO TROUBLE HIMSELF ABOUT A SMALL OR GREAT GRIEVANCE AT ANY RATE THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE
6540-62512-0022 BUT THEY MUST GIVE UP THE FEAST OF HARD EGGS WHICH THEY HAD MEANT TO PREPARE AND A MEAL OF RAW FLESH WAS NOT AN AGREEABLE PROSPECT EITHER FOR THEMSELVES OR FOR THE OTHERS BEFORE RETURNING TO THE CAVE THE SAILOR AND HERBERT IN THE EVENT OF FIRE BEING POSITIVELY UNATTAINABLE
6540-62512-0023 COLLECTED SOME MORE SHELL FISH AND THEN SILENTLY RETRACED THEIR STEPS TO THEIR DWELLING PENCROFT HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND STILL LOOKED FOR HIS BOX HE EVEN CLIMBED UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER FROM ITS MOUTH TO THE ANGLE WHERE THE RAFT HAD BEEN MOORED
6540-62512-0024 HE RETURNED TO THE PLATEAU WENT OVER IT IN EVERY DIRECTION SEARCHED AMONG THE HIGH GRASS ON THE BORDER OF THE FOREST ALL IN VAIN IT WAS FIVE IN THE EVENING WHEN HE AND HERBERT RE ENTERED THE CAVE
6540-62512-0025 IT IS USELESS TO SAY THAT THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE PASSAGES WERE RANSACKED BEFORE THEY WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP IN DESPAIR TOWARDS SIX O'CLOCK WHEN THE SUN WAS DISAPPEARING BEHIND THE HIGH LANDS OF THE WEST HERBERT WHO WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN ON THE STRAND
6540-62512-0026 THEY WERE RETURNING ALONE THE BOY'S HEART SANK THE SAILOR HAD NOT BEEN DECEIVED IN HIS FOREBODINGS THE ENGINEER CYRUS HARDING HAD NOT BEEN FOUND THE REPORTER ON HIS ARRIVAL SAT DOWN ON A ROCK WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING
6540-62512-0027 EXHAUSTED WITH FATIGUE DYING OF HUNGER HE HAD NOT STRENGTH TO UTTER A WORD
6540-62512-0028 AND THE TEARS WHICH HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN TOLD TOO CLEARLY THAT HE HAD LOST ALL HOPE THE REPORTER RECOUNTED ALL THAT THEY HAD DONE IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO RECOVER CYRUS HARDING
6540-62512-0029 AND CONSEQUENTLY MUCH BEYOND THE PLACE WHERE THE BALLOON HAD FALLEN THE LAST TIME BUT ONE A FALL WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE ENGINEER AND THE DOG TOP THE SHORE WAS SOLITARY NOT A VESTIGE OF A MARK NOT EVEN A PEBBLE RECENTLY DISPLACED
6540-62512-0030 NOT A TRACE ON THE SAND NOT A HUMAN FOOTSTEP ON ALL THAT PART OF THE BEACH IT WAS CLEAR THAT THAT PORTION OF THE SHORE HAD NEVER BEEN VISITED BY A HUMAN BEING THE SEA WAS AS DESERTED AS THE LAND AND IT WAS THERE A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE COAST
6540-62512-0031 THAT THE ENGINEER MUST HAVE FOUND A TOMB
6540-62512-0032 EXCLAIMING IN A VOICE WHICH SHOWED HOW HOPE STRUGGLED WITHIN HIM NO HE IS NOT DEAD HE CAN'T BE DEAD IT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ANY ONE ELSE BUT NEVER TO HIM HE COULD GET OUT OF ANYTHING
6540-62512-0033 OH I CAN DO NO MORE HE MURMURED
6540-62512-0034 WE WILL FIND HIM GOD WILL GIVE HIM BACK TO US BUT IN THE MEANTIME YOU ARE HUNGRY AND YOU MUST EAT SOMETHING SO SAYING HE OFFERED THE POOR NEGRO A FEW HANDFULS OF SHELL FISH WHICH WAS INDEED WRETCHED AND INSUFFICIENT FOOD
6540-62512-0035 BUT HE REFUSED THEM HE COULD NOT WOULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT HIS MASTER AS TO GIDEON SPILETT HE DEVOURED THE SHELL FISH THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON THE SAND AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK HE WAS VERY WEAK BUT CALM HERBERT WENT UP TO HIM AND TAKING HIS HAND
6540-62512-0036 SIR SAID HE WE HAVE FOUND A SHELTER WHICH WILL BE BETTER THAN LYING HERE NIGHT IS ADVANCING COME AND REST TO MORROW WE WILL SEARCH FARTHER THE REPORTER GOT UP AND GUIDED BY THE BOY WENT TOWARDS THE CAVE
6540-62512-0037 ON THE WAY PENCROFT ASKED HIM IN THE MOST NATURAL TONE IF BY CHANCE HE HAPPENED TO HAVE A MATCH OR TWO THE REPORTER STOPPED FELT IN HIS POCKETS BUT FINDING NOTHING SAID I HAD SOME BUT I MUST HAVE THROWN THEM AWAY
6540-62512-0038 CONFOUND IT EXCLAIMED THE SAILOR THE REPORTER HEARD HIM AND SEIZING HIS ARM HAVE YOU NO MATCHES HE ASKED NOT ONE AND NO FIRE IN CONSEQUENCE
6540-62512-0039 HE WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO THE FOUR CASTAWAYS REMAINED MOTIONLESS LOOKING UNEASILY AT EACH OTHER HERBERT WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE BY SAYING MISTER SPILETT YOU ARE A SMOKER AND ALWAYS HAVE MATCHES ABOUT YOU
6540-62512-0040 TRY AGAIN A SINGLE MATCH WILL BE ENOUGH THE REPORTER HUNTED AGAIN IN THE POCKETS OF HIS TROUSERS WAISTCOAT AND GREAT COAT AND AT LAST TO PENCROFT'S GREAT JOY NO LESS TO HIS EXTREME SURPRISE HE FELT A TINY PIECE OF WOOD ENTANGLED IN THE LINING OF HIS WAISTCOAT
6540-62512-0041 HE SEIZED IT WITH HIS FINGERS THROUGH THE STUFF BUT HE COULD NOT GET IT OUT IF THIS WAS A MATCH AND A SINGLE ONE IT WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT TO RUB OFF THE PHOSPHORUS WILL YOU LET ME TRY SAID THE BOY AND VERY CLEVERLY WITHOUT BREAKING IT
6540-62512-0042 HE MANAGED TO DRAW OUT THE WRETCHED YET PRECIOUS LITTLE BIT OF WOOD WHICH WAS OF SUCH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THESE POOR MEN IT WAS UNUSED HURRAH CRIED PENCROFT IT IS AS GOOD AS HAVING A WHOLE CARGO
6540-62512-0043 HE TOOK THE MATCH AND FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANIONS ENTERED THE CAVE THIS SMALL PIECE OF WOOD OF WHICH SO MANY IN AN INHABITED COUNTRY ARE WASTED WITH INDIFFERENCE AND ARE OF NO VALUE MUST HERE BE USED WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION
6540-62512-0044 THE SAILOR FIRST MADE SURE THAT IT WAS QUITE DRY THAT DONE WE MUST HAVE SOME PAPER SAID HE HERE REPLIED SPILETT AFTER SOME HESITATION TEARING A LEAF OUT OF HIS NOTE BOOK PENCROFT TOOK THE PIECE OF PAPER WHICH THE REPORTER HELD OUT TO HIM
6540-62512-0045 AND KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE FIREPLACE SOME HANDFULS OF GRASS LEAVES AND DRY MOSS WERE PLACED UNDER THE FAGOTS AND DISPOSED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE AIR COULD EASILY CIRCULATE AND THE DRY WOOD WOULD RAPIDLY CATCH FIRE
6540-62512-0046 PENCROFT THEN TWISTED THE PIECE OF PAPER INTO THE SHAPE OF A CONE AS SMOKERS DO IN A HIGH WIND AND POKED IT IN AMONG THE MOSS TAKING A SMALL ROUGH STONE HE WIPED IT CAREFULLY AND WITH A BEATING HEART HOLDING HIS BREATH
6540-62512-0047 THE FIRST ATTEMPT DID NOT PRODUCE ANY EFFECT PENCROFT HAD NOT STRUCK HARD ENOUGH FEARING TO RUB OFF THE PHOSPHORUS NO I CAN'T DO IT SAID HE MY HAND TREMBLES THE MATCH HAS MISSED FIRE I CANNOT I WILL NOT
6540-62512-0048 AND RISING HE TOLD HERBERT TO TAKE HIS PLACE CERTAINLY THE BOY HAD NEVER IN ALL HIS LIFE BEEN SO NERVOUS PROMETHEUS GOING TO STEAL THE FIRE FROM HEAVEN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ANXIOUS HE DID NOT HESITATE HOWEVER BUT STRUCK THE MATCH DIRECTLY
6540-62512-0049 MAKING A CHOKING SMOKE HERBERT QUICKLY TURNED THE MATCH SO AS TO AUGMENT THE FLAME AND THEN SLIPPED IT INTO THE PAPER CONE WHICH IN A FEW SECONDS TOO CAUGHT FIRE AND THEN THE MOSS
6540-62512-0050 A MINUTE LATER THE DRY WOOD CRACKLED AND A CHEERFUL FLAME ASSISTED BY THE VIGOROUS BLOWING OF THE SAILOR SPRANG UP IN THE MIDST OF THE DARKNESS AT LAST CRIED PENCROFT GETTING UP I WAS NEVER SO NERVOUS BEFORE IN ALL MY LIFE
6540-62512-0051 THE FLAT STONES MADE A CAPITAL FIREPLACE THE SMOKE WENT QUITE EASILY OUT AT THE NARROW PASSAGE THE CHIMNEY DREW AND AN AGREEABLE WARMTH WAS NOT LONG IN BEING FELT THEY MUST NOW TAKE GREAT CARE NOT TO LET THE FIRE GO OUT
6540-62512-0052 AND ALWAYS TO KEEP SOME EMBERS ALIGHT IT ONLY NEEDED CARE AND ATTENTION
6540-62512-0053 PENCROFT'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO USE THE FIRE BY PREPARING A MORE NOURISHING SUPPER THAN A DISH OF SHELL FISH TWO DOZEN EGGS WERE BROUGHT BY HERBERT THE REPORTER LEANING UP IN A CORNER WATCHED THESE PREPARATIONS WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING
6540-62512-0054 A THREEFOLD THOUGHT WEIGHED ON HIS MIND WAS CYRUS STILL ALIVE IF HE WAS ALIVE WHERE WAS HE IF HE HAD SURVIVED FROM HIS FALL HOW WAS IT THAT HE HAD NOT FOUND SOME MEANS OF MAKING KNOWN HIS EXISTENCE
6540-62512-0055 HE WAS ROAMING ABOUT THE SHORE HE WAS LIKE A BODY WITHOUT A SOUL PENCROFT KNEW FIFTY WAYS OF COOKING EGGS BUT THIS TIME HE HAD NO CHOICE AND WAS OBLIGED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH ROASTING THEM UNDER THE HOT CINDERS IN A FEW MINUTES THE COOKING WAS DONE
6540-62512-0056 AND THE SEAMAN INVITED THE REPORTER TO TAKE HIS SHARE OF THE SUPPER SUCH WAS THE FIRST REPAST OF THE CASTAWAYS ON THIS UNKNOWN COAST THE HARD EGGS WERE EXCELLENT AND AS EGGS CONTAIN EVERYTHING INDISPENSABLE TO MAN'S NOURISHMENT
6540-62512-0057 THESE POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT THEMSELVES WELL OFF AND WERE MUCH STRENGTHENED BY THEM OH IF ONLY ONE OF THEM HAD NOT BEEN MISSING AT THIS MEAL IF THE FIVE PRISONERS WHO ESCAPED FROM RICHMOND HAD BEEN ALL THERE UNDER THE PILED UP ROCKS
6540-62512-0058 BEFORE THIS CLEAR CRACKLING FIRE ON THE DRY SAND WHAT THANKSGIVING MUST THEY HAVE RENDERED TO HEAVEN BUT THE MOST INGENIOUS THE MOST LEARNED HE WHO WAS THEIR UNQUESTIONED CHIEF CYRUS HARDING WAS ALAS MISSING
6540-62512-0059 AND HIS BODY HAD NOT EVEN OBTAINED A BURIAL PLACE THUS PASSED THE TWENTY FIFTH OF MARCH NIGHT HAD COME ON OUTSIDE COULD BE HEARD THE HOWLING OF THE WIND AND THE MONOTONOUS SOUND OF THE SURF BREAKING ON THE SHORE
6540-62512-0060 THE WAVES ROLLED THE SHINGLE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH A DEAFENING NOISE THE REPORTER RETIRED INTO A DARK CORNER AFTER HAVING SHORTLY NOTED DOWN THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THIS NEW LAND THE LOSS OF THEIR LEADER
6540-62512-0061 THE EXPLORATION OF THE COAST THE INCIDENT OF THE MATCHES ET CETERA AND THEN OVERCOME BY FATIGUE HE MANAGED TO FORGET HIS SORROWS IN SLEEP HERBERT WENT TO SLEEP DIRECTLY AS TO THE SAILOR HE PASSED THE NIGHT WITH ONE EYE ON THE FIRE
6540-62512-0062 ON WHICH HE DID NOT SPARE FUEL BUT ONE OF THE CASTAWAYS DID NOT SLEEP IN THE CAVE
