6513-71946-0000 CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF THE PIRATE ATTACK HAD BEEN A COMPLETE SURPRISE A SURE PROOF THAT THE UNSCRUPULOUS HOOK HAD CONDUCTED IT IMPROPERLY FOR TO SURPRISE REDSKINS FAIRLY IS BEYOND THE WIT OF THE WHITE MAN
6513-71946-0001 BY ALL THE UNWRITTEN LAWS OF SAVAGE WARFARE IT IS ALWAYS THE REDSKIN WHO ATTACKS AND WITH THE WILINESS OF HIS RACE HE DOES IT JUST BEFORE THE DAWN AT WHICH TIME HE KNOWS THE COURAGE OF THE WHITES TO BE AT ITS LOWEST EBB
6513-71946-0002 THE WHITE MEN HAVE IN THE MEANTIME MADE A RUDE STOCKADE ON THE SUMMIT OF YONDER UNDULATING GROUND AT THE FOOT OF WHICH A STREAM RUNS FOR IT IS DESTRUCTION TO BE TOO FAR FROM WATER
6513-71946-0003 THE INEXPERIENCED ONES CLUTCHING THEIR REVOLVERS AND TREADING ON TWIGS BUT THE OLD HANDS SLEEPING TRANQUILLY UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE DAWN THROUGH THE LONG BLACK NIGHT THE SAVAGE SCOUTS WRIGGLE
6513-71946-0004 SNAKE LIKE AMONG THE GRASS WITHOUT STIRRING A BLADE THE BRUSHWOOD CLOSES BEHIND THEM AS SILENTLY AS SAND INTO WHICH A MOLE HAS DIVED NOT A SOUND IS TO BE HEARD
6513-71946-0005 SAVE WHEN THEY GIVE VENT TO A WONDERFUL IMITATION OF THE LONELY CALL OF THE COYOTE THE CRY IS ANSWERED BY OTHER BRAVES AND SOME OF THEM DO IT EVEN BETTER THAN THE COYOTES WHO ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT IT
6513-71946-0006 SO THE CHILL HOURS WEAR ON AND THE LONG SUSPENSE IS HORRIBLY TRYING TO THE PALEFACE WHO HAS TO LIVE THROUGH IT FOR THE FIRST TIME
6513-71946-0007 THOSE GHASTLY CALLS AND STILL GHASTLIER SILENCES ARE BUT AN INTIMATION OF HOW THE NIGHT IS MARCHING
6513-71946-0008 THAT IN DISREGARDING IT HE CANNOT BE EXCUSED ON THE PLEA OF IGNORANCE THE PICCANINNIES ON THEIR PART TRUSTED IMPLICITLY TO HIS HONOUR AND THEIR WHOLE ACTION OF THE NIGHT STANDS OUT IN MARKED CONTRAST TO HIS
6513-71946-0009 THEY LEFT NOTHING UNDONE THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE REPUTATION OF THEIR TRIBE WITH THAT ALERTNESS OF THE SENSES WHICH IS AT ONCE THE MARVEL AND DESPAIR OF CIVILISED PEOPLES
6513-71946-0010 THEY KNEW THAT THE PIRATES WERE ON THE ISLAND FROM THE MOMENT ONE OF THEM TROD ON A DRY STICK AND IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME
6513-71946-0011 EVERY FOOT OF GROUND BETWEEN THE SPOT WHERE HOOK HAD LANDED HIS FORCES AND THE HOME UNDER THE TREES WAS STEALTHILY EXAMINED BY BRAVES WEARING THEIR MOCASSINS WITH THE HEELS IN FRONT
6513-71946-0012 THEY FOUND ONLY ONE HILLOCK WITH A STREAM AT ITS BASE SO THAT HOOK HAD NO CHOICE HERE HE MUST ESTABLISH HIMSELF AND WAIT FOR JUST BEFORE THE DAWN EVERYTHING BEING THUS MAPPED OUT WITH ALMOST DIABOLICAL CUNNING
6513-71946-0013 THE MAIN BODY OF THE REDSKINS FOLDED THEIR BLANKETS AROUND THEM AND IN THE PHLEGMATIC MANNER THAT IS TO THEM THE PEARL OF MANHOOD SQUATTED ABOVE THE CHILDREN'S HOME AWAITING THE COLD MOMENT WHEN THEY SHOULD DEAL PALE DEATH
6513-71946-0014 HERE DREAMING THOUGH WIDE AWAKE OF THE EXQUISITE TORTURES TO WHICH THEY WERE TO PUT HIM AT BREAK OF DAY THOSE CONFIDING SAVAGES WERE FOUND BY THE TREACHEROUS HOOK
6513-71946-0015 FROM THE ACCOUNTS AFTERWARDS SUPPLIED BY SUCH OF THE SCOUTS AS ESCAPED THE CARNAGE HE DOES NOT SEEM EVEN TO HAVE PAUSED AT THE RISING GROUND THOUGH IT IS CERTAIN THAT IN THAT GREY LIGHT HE MUST HAVE SEEN IT
6513-71946-0016 NO THOUGHT OF WAITING TO BE ATTACKED APPEARS FROM FIRST TO LAST TO HAVE VISITED HIS SUBTLE MIND HE WOULD NOT EVEN HOLD OFF TILL THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY SPENT ON HE POUNDED WITH NO POLICY BUT TO FALL TO
6513-71946-0017 WHAT COULD THE BEWILDERED SCOUTS DO MASTERS AS THEY WERE OF EVERY WARLIKE ARTIFICE SAVE THIS ONE BUT TROT HELPLESSLY AFTER HIM EXPOSING THEMSELVES FATALLY TO VIEW
6513-71946-0018 AROUND THE BRAVE TIGER LILY WERE A DOZEN OF HER STOUTEST WARRIORS AND THEY SUDDENLY SAW THE PERFIDIOUS PIRATES BEARING DOWN UPON THEM FELL FROM THEIR EYES THEN THE FILM THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD LOOKED AT VICTORY NO MORE WOULD THEY TORTURE AT THE STAKE
6513-71946-0019 FOR THEM THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUNDS NOW THEY KNEW IT BUT AS THEIR FATHERS SONS THEY ACQUITTED THEMSELVES EVEN THEN THEY HAD TIME TO GATHER IN A PHALANX
6513-71946-0020 HAD THEY RISEN QUICKLY BUT THIS THEY WERE FORBIDDEN TO DO BY THE TRADITIONS OF THEIR RACE IT IS WRITTEN THAT THE NOBLE SAVAGE MUST NEVER EXPRESS SURPRISE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WHITE
6513-71946-0021 THEY REMAINED STATIONARY FOR A MOMENT NOT A MUSCLE MOVING AS IF THE FOE HAD COME BY INVITATION THEN INDEED THE TRADITION GALLANTLY UPHELD THEY SEIZED THEIR WEAPONS AND THE AIR WAS TORN WITH THE WARCRY
6513-71946-0022 BUT IT WAS NOW TOO LATE IT IS NO PART OF OURS TO DESCRIBE WHAT WAS A MASSACRE RATHER THAN A FIGHT THUS PERISHED MANY OF THE FLOWER OF THE PICCANINNY TRIBE NOT ALL UNAVENGED DID THEY DIE
6513-71946-0023 FOR WITH LEAN WOLF FELL ALF MASON TO DISTURB THE SPANISH MAIN NO MORE AND AMONG OTHERS WHO BIT THE DUST WERE GEO SCOURIE CHAS TURLEY AND THE ALSATIAN FOGGERTY TURLEY FELL TO THE TOMAHAWK OF THE TERRIBLE PANTHER
6513-71946-0024 WHO ULTIMATELY CUT A WAY THROUGH THE PIRATES WITH TIGER LILY AND A SMALL REMNANT OF THE TRIBE TO WHAT EXTENT HOOK IS TO BLAME FOR HIS TACTICS ON THIS OCCASION IS FOR THE HISTORIAN TO DECIDE
6513-71946-0025 HE AND HIS MEN WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN BUTCHERED AND IN JUDGING HIM IT IS ONLY FAIR TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT WHAT HE SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE DONE WAS TO ACQUAINT HIS OPPONENTS THAT HE PROPOSED TO FOLLOW A NEW METHOD ON THE OTHER HAND THIS
6513-71946-0026 AS DESTROYING THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE WOULD HAVE MADE HIS STRATEGY OF NO AVAIL SO THAT THE WHOLE QUESTION IS BESET WITH DIFFICULTIES ONE CANNOT AT LEAST WITHHOLD A RELUCTANT ADMIRATION FOR THE WIT THAT HAD CONCEIVED SO BOLD A SCHEME
6513-71946-0027 AND THE FELL GENIUS WITH WHICH IT WAS CARRIED OUT WHAT WERE HIS OWN FEELINGS ABOUT HIMSELF AT THAT TRIUMPHANT MOMENT FAIN WOULD HIS DOGS HAVE KNOWN AS BREATHING HEAVILY AND WIPING THEIR CUTLASSES THEY GATHERED AT A DISCREET DISTANCE FROM HIS HOOK
6513-71946-0028 AND SQUINTED THROUGH THEIR FERRET EYES AT THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN ELATION MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIS HEART BUT HIS FACE DID NOT REFLECT IT EVER A DARK AND SOLITARY ENIGMA HE STOOD ALOOF FROM HIS FOLLOWERS IN SPIRIT AS IN SUBSTANCE
6513-71946-0029 FOR IT WAS NOT THE REDSKINS HE HAD COME OUT TO DESTROY THEY WERE BUT THE BEES TO BE SMOKED
6513-71946-0030 IT WAS PAN HE WANTED PAN AND WENDY AND THEIR BAND BUT CHIEFLY PAN PETER WAS SUCH A SMALL BOY THAT ONE TENDS TO WONDER AT THE MAN'S HATRED OF HIM TRUE
6513-71946-0031 HE HAD FLUNG HOOK'S ARM TO THE CROCODILE BUT EVEN THIS AND THE INCREASED INSECURITY OF LIFE TO WHICH IT LED OWING TO THE CROCODILE'S PERTINACITY HARDLY ACCOUNT FOR A VINDICTIVENESS SO RELENTLESS AND MALIGNANT
6513-71946-0032 WHICH GOADED THE PIRATE CAPTAIN TO FRENZY IT WAS NOT HIS COURAGE IT WAS NOT HIS ENGAGING APPEARANCE IT WAS NOT THERE IS NO BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH FOR WE KNOW QUITE WELL WHAT IT WAS AND HAVE GOT TO TELL IT WAS PETER'S COCKINESS
6513-71946-0033 IT MADE HIS IRON CLAW TWITCH AND AT NIGHT IT DISTURBED HIM LIKE AN INSECT WHILE PETER LIVED THE TORTURED MAN FELT THAT HE WAS A LION IN A CAGE INTO WHICH A SPARROW HAD COME
6513-71946-0034 OR HOW TO GET HIS DOGS DOWN HE RAN HIS GREEDY EYES OVER THEM
6513-71946-0035 IN THE MEANTIME WHAT OF THE BOYS WE HAVE SEEN THEM AT THE FIRST CLANG OF WEAPONS TURNED AS IT WERE INTO STONE FIGURES OPEN MOUTHED ALL APPEALING WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TO PETER
6513-71946-0036 AND WE RETURN TO THEM AS THEIR MOUTHS CLOSE AND THEIR ARMS FALL TO THEIR SIDES THE PANDEMONIUM ABOVE HAS CEASED ALMOST AS SUDDENLY AS IT AROSE PASSED LIKE A FIERCE GUST OF WIND BUT THEY KNOW THAT IN THE PASSING
6513-71946-0037 IT HAS DETERMINED THEIR FATE WHICH SIDE HAD WON
6513-71946-0038 HEARD THE QUESTION PUT BY EVERY BOY AND ALAS THEY ALSO HEARD PETER'S ANSWER IF THE REDSKINS HAVE WON HE SAID THEY WILL BEAT THE TOM TOM IT IS ALWAYS THEIR SIGN OF VICTORY
6513-71946-0039 NOW SMEE HAD FOUND THE TOM TOM AND WAS AT THAT MOMENT SITTING ON IT YOU WILL NEVER HEAR THE TOM TOM AGAIN HE MUTTERED BUT INAUDIBLY OF COURSE FOR STRICT SILENCE HAD BEEN ENJOINED
6513-71946-0040 TO HIS AMAZEMENT HOOK SIGNED TO HIM TO BEAT THE TOM TOM AND SLOWLY THERE CAME TO SMEE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DREADFUL WICKEDNESS OF THE ORDER NEVER PROBABLY HAD THIS SIMPLE MAN ADMIRED HOOK SO MUCH
6513-71946-0041 TWICE SMEE BEAT UPON THE INSTRUMENT AND THEN STOPPED TO LISTEN GLEEFULLY THE TOM TOM THE MISCREANTS HEARD PETER CRY AN INDIAN VICTORY THE DOOMED CHILDREN ANSWERED WITH A CHEER
6513-71946-0042 THAT WAS MUSIC TO THE BLACK HEARTS ABOVE AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THEY REPEATED THEIR GOODBYES TO PETER THIS PUZZLED THE PIRATES BUT ALL THEIR OTHER FEELINGS WERE SWALLOWED BY A BASE DELIGHT THAT THE ENEMY WERE ABOUT TO COME UP THE TREES
6513-71946-0043 THEY SMIRKED AT EACH OTHER AND RUBBED THEIR HANDS RAPIDLY AND SILENTLY HOOK GAVE HIS ORDERS ONE MAN TO EACH TREE
