313-127992-0000 THIS WAR HASTENED THE APPROACH OF THE GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE KING SHOULD HAVE A LARGE MILITARY FORCE HE COULD NOT HAVE SUCH A FORCE WITHOUT MONEY
313-127992-0001 MUST ADMINISTER THE GOVERNMENT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OR MUST VENTURE ON SUCH A VIOLATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE LAND AS HAD BEEN UNKNOWN DURING SEVERAL CENTURIES
313-127992-0002 A DEFICIENCY IN THEIR REVENUE BY A BENEVOLENCE OR A FORCED LOAN BUT THESE EXPEDIENTS WERE ALWAYS OF A TEMPORARY NATURE TO MEET THE REGULAR CHARGE OF A LONG WAR BY REGULAR TAXATION
313-127992-0003 WAS A COURSE WHICH HENRY THE EIGHTH HIMSELF WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO TAKE IT SEEMED THEREFORE THAT THE DECISIVE HOUR WAS APPROACHING
313-127992-0004 EITHER SHARE THE FATE OF THE SENATES OF THE CONTINENT OR OBTAIN SUPREME ASCENDENCY IN THE STATE JUST AT THIS CONJUNCTURE JAMES DIED CHARLES THE FIRST SUCCEEDED TO THE THRONE
313-127992-0005 HE HAD RECEIVED FROM NATURE A FAR BETTER UNDERSTANDING A FAR STRONGER WILL
313-127992-0006 AND WAS MUCH MORE DISPOSED THAN HIS FATHER TO CARRY THEM INTO PRACTICE HE WAS LIKE HIS FATHER A ZEALOUS EPISCOPALIAN HE WAS MOREOVER WHAT HIS FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN A ZEALOUS ARMINIAN
313-127992-0007 AND THOUGH NO PAPIST LIKED A PAPIST MUCH BETTER THAN A PURITAN IT WOULD BE UNJUST TO DENY THAT CHARLES HAD SOME OF THE QUALITIES OF A GOOD AND EVEN OF A GREAT PRINCE HE WROTE AND SPOKE NOT LIKE HIS FATHER
313-127992-0008 WITH THE EXACTNESS OF A PROFESSOR BUT AFTER THE FASHION OF INTELLIGENT AND WELL EDUCATED GENTLEMEN HIS TASTE IN LITERATURE AND ART WAS EXCELLENT HIS MANNER DIGNIFIED THOUGH NOT GRACIOUS HIS DOMESTIC LIFE WITHOUT BLEMISH
313-127992-0009 HE WAS IN TRUTH IMPELLED BY AN INCURABLE PROPENSITY TO DARK AND CROOKED WAYS
313-127992-0010 WAS SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE SHOULD NEVER HAVE REPROACHED HIM WITH THIS GREAT VICE
313-127992-0011 NOT ONLY FROM CONSTITUTION AND FROM HABIT BUT ALSO ON PRINCIPLE HE SEEMS TO HAVE LEARNED FROM THE THEOLOGIANS WHOM HE MOST ESTEEMED THAT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SUBJECTS
313-127992-0012 THERE COULD BE NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF MUTUAL CONTRACT
313-127992-0013 DIVEST HIMSELF OF HIS DESPOTIC AUTHORITY AND THAT IN EVERY PROMISE WHICH HE MADE THERE WAS AN IMPLIED RESERVATION THAT SUCH PROMISE MIGHT BE BROKEN IN CASE OF NECESSITY AND THAT OF THE NECESSITY HE WAS THE SOLE JUDGE
313-127992-0014 IT WAS PLAYED ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WITH KEENNESS BUT WITH ADMIRABLE DEXTERITY COOLNESS AND PERSEVERANCE GREAT STATESMEN WHO LOOKED FAR BEHIND THEM AND FAR BEFORE THEM WERE AT THE HEAD OF THAT ASSEMBLY
313-127992-0015 THEY WERE RESOLVED TO PLACE THE KING IN SUCH A SITUATION THAT HE MUST EITHER CONDUCT THE ADMINISTRATION IN CONFORMITY WITH THE WISHES OF HIS PARLIAMENT OR MAKE OUTRAGEOUS ATTACKS ON THE MOST SACRED PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION
313-127992-0016 THEY ACCORDINGLY DOLED OUT SUPPLIES TO HIM VERY SPARINGLY
313-127992-0017 HIS CHOICE WAS SOON MADE HE DISSOLVED HIS FIRST PARLIAMENT AND LEVIED TAXES BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY HE CONVOKED A SECOND PARLIAMENT AND FOUND IT MORE INTRACTABLE THAN THE FIRST
313-127992-0018 AND THREW THE CHIEFS OF THE OPPOSITION INTO PRISON AT THE SAME TIME A NEW GRIEVANCE WHICH THE PECULIAR FEELINGS AND HABITS OF THE ENGLISH NATION MADE INSUPPORTABLY PAINFUL
313-127992-0019 TO BE OF FEARFUL AUGURY EXCITED GENERAL DISCONTENT AND ALARM COMPANIES OF SOLDIERS WERE BILLETED ON THE PEOPLE AND MARTIAL LAW WAS IN SOME PLACES
313-127992-0020 SUBSTITUTED FOR THE ANCIENT JURISPRUDENCE OF THE REALM THE KING CALLED A THIRD PARLIAMENT AND SOON PERCEIVED THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS STRONGER AND FIERCER THAN EVER
313-127992-0021 HE NOW DETERMINED ON A CHANGE OF TACTICS INSTEAD OF OPPOSING AN INFLEXIBLE RESISTANCE TO THE DEMANDS OF THE COMMONS HE AFTER MUCH ALTERCATION AND MANY EVASIONS AGREED TO A COMPROMISE WHICH IF HE HAD FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO IT
313-127992-0022 WOULD HAVE AVERTED A LONG SERIES OF CALAMITIES THE PARLIAMENT GRANTED AN AMPLE SUPPLY THE KING RATIFIED IN THE MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT CELEBRATED LAW WHICH IS
313-127992-0023 BY RATIFYING THAT LAW HE BOUND HIMSELF NEVER AGAIN TO RAISE MONEY WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE HOUSES
313-127992-0024 AND NEVER AGAIN TO SUBJECT HIS PEOPLE TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS MARTIAL THE DAY ON WHICH THE ROYAL SANCTION WAS AFTER MANY DELAYS SOLEMNLY GIVEN TO THIS GREAT ACT WAS A DAY OF JOY AND HOPE
313-127992-0025 THE CLERK HAD PRONOUNCED THE ANCIENT FORM OF WORDS BY WHICH OUR PRINCES HAVE DURING MANY AGES
313-127992-0026 IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT CHARLES HAD NO INTENTION OF OBSERVING THE COMPACT INTO WHICH HE HAD ENTERED THE SUPPLY GIVEN BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION WAS COLLECTED
313-127992-0027 THE PROMISE BY WHICH THAT SUPPLY HAD BEEN OBTAINED WAS BROKEN
313-127992-0028 SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS WERE IMPRISONED AND ONE OF THEM SIR JOHN ELIOT AFTER YEARS OF SUFFERING DIED IN CONFINEMENT CHARLES HOWEVER COULD NOT VENTURE TO RAISE BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY
313-127992-0029 TAXES SUFFICIENT FOR CARRYING ON WAR HE ACCORDINGLY HASTENED TO MAKE PEACE WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS AND THENCEFORTH GAVE HIS WHOLE MIND TO BRITISH POLITICS NOW COMMENCED A NEW ERA
313-127992-0030 MANY ENGLISH KINGS HAD OCCASIONALLY COMMITTED UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTS BUT NONE HAD EVER SYSTEMATICALLY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE HIMSELF A DESPOT AND TO REDUCE THE PARLIAMENT TO A NULLITY
313-127992-0031 SUCH WAS THE END WHICH CHARLES DISTINCTLY PROPOSED TO HIMSELF FROM MARCH SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE TO APRIL SIXTEEN FORTY THE HOUSES WERE NOT CONVOKED
313-127992-0032 ONLY ONCE HAD THERE BEEN AN INTERVAL OF EVEN HALF THAT LENGTH THIS FACT ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO REFUTE THOSE WHO REPRESENT CHARLES AS HAVING MERELY TRODDEN IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE PLANTAGENETS AND TUDORS
313-127992-0033 IT IS PROVED BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE KING'S MOST STRENUOUS SUPPORTERS THAT DURING THIS PART OF HIS REIGN THE PROVISIONS OF THE PETITION OF RIGHT WERE VIOLATED BY HIM NOT OCCASIONALLY BUT CONSTANTLY AND ON SYSTEM
313-127992-0034 THAT A LARGE PART OF THE REVENUE WAS RAISED WITHOUT ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY AND THAT PERSONS OBNOXIOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT LANGUISHED FOR YEARS IN PRISON WITHOUT BEING EVER CALLED UPON TO PLEAD BEFORE ANY TRIBUNAL
313-127992-0035 FOR THESE THINGS HISTORY MUST HOLD THE KING HIMSELF CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FROM THE TIME OF HIS THIRD PARLIAMENT HE WAS HIS OWN PRIME MINISTER
313-127992-0036 WAS THE COUNSELLOR MOST TRUSTED IN POLITICAL AND MILITARY AFFAIRS
313-127992-0037 AND FELT TOWARDS THOSE WHOM HE HAD DESERTED THAT PECULIAR MALIGNITY WHICH HAS IN ALL AGES BEEN CHARACTERISTIC OF APOSTATES
313-127992-0038 AND HAD FORMED A VAST AND DEEPLY MEDITATED SCHEME WHICH VERY NEARLY CONFOUNDED EVEN THE ABLE TACTICS OF THE STATESMEN BY WHOM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN DIRECTED
313-127992-0039 TO THIS SCHEME IN HIS CONFIDENTIAL CORRESPONDENCE HE GAVE THE EXPRESSIVE NAME OF THOROUGH HIS OBJECT WAS TO DO IN ENGLAND ALL AND MORE THAN ALL
313-127992-0040 TO MAKE CHARLES A MONARCH AS ABSOLUTE AS ANY ON THE CONTINENT
313-127992-0041 AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CROWN TO DEPRIVE THE COURTS OF LAW OF ALL INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY
313-127992-0042 AND TO PUNISH WITH MERCILESS RIGOUR ALL WHO MURMURED AT THE ACTS OF THE GOVERNMENT
313-127992-0043 EVEN IN THE MOST DECENT AND REGULAR MANNER
313-127992-0044 A COHERENCE A PRECISION WHICH IF HE HAD NOT BEEN PURSUING AN OBJECT
313-127992-0045 HE SAW THAT THERE WAS ONE INSTRUMENT
313-127992-0046 COULD BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION THAT INSTRUMENT WAS A STANDING ARMY TO THE FORMING OF SUCH AN ARMY THEREFORE HE DIRECTED ALL THE ENERGY OF HIS STRONG MIND
313-127992-0047 BUT ALSO OVER THE ENGLISH COLONISTS AND WAS ABLE TO BOAST THAT IN THAT ISLAND
313-127992-0048 ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
313-127992-0049 LAUD HAD DEPARTED FARTHEST FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REFORMATION AND HAD DRAWN NEAREST TO ROME HIS THEOLOGY WAS MORE REMOTE THAN EVEN THAT OF THE DUTCH ARMINIANS FROM THE THEOLOGY OF THE CALVINISTS
313-127992-0050 HIS ILL CONCEALED DISLIKE OF THE MARRIAGE OF ECCLESIASTICS THE ARDENT AND NOT ALTOGETHER DISINTERESTED ZEAL WITH WHICH HE ASSERTED THE CLAIMS OF THE CLERGY TO THE REVERENCE OF THE LAITY WOULD HAVE MADE HIM AN OBJECT OF AVERSION TO THE PURITANS
313-127992-0051 EVEN IF HE HAD USED ONLY LEGAL AND GENTLE MEANS FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ENDS BUT HIS UNDERSTANDING WAS NARROW AND HIS COMMERCE WITH THE WORLD HAD BEEN SMALL HE WAS BY NATURE RASH IRRITABLE
313-127992-0052 QUICK TO FEEL FOR HIS OWN DIGNITY SLOW TO SYMPATHISE WITH THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS AND PRONE TO THE ERROR
313-127992-0053 FOR EMOTIONS OF PIOUS ZEAL UNDER HIS DIRECTION EVERY CORNER OF THE REALM WAS SUBJECTED TO A CONSTANT AND MINUTE INSPECTION EVERY LITTLE CONGREGATION OF SEPARATISTS WAS TRACKED OUT AND BROKEN UP
313-127992-0054 EVEN THE DEVOTIONS OF PRIVATE FAMILIES COULD NOT ESCAPE THE VIGILANCE OF HIS SPIES
313-127992-0055 WHICH FESTERED IN INNUMERABLE BOSOMS WAS GENERALLY DISGUISED UNDER AN OUTWARD SHOW OF CONFORMITY ON THE VERY EVE OF TROUBLES FATAL TO HIMSELF AND TO HIS ORDER THE BISHOPS OF SEVERAL EXTENSIVE DIOCESES WERE ABLE TO
313-127992-0056 REPORT TO HIM THAT NOT A SINGLE DISSENTER WAS TO BE FOUND
313-127992-0057 THE JUDGES OF THE COMMON LAW HOLDING THEIR SITUATIONS DURING THE PLEASURE OF THE KING WERE SCANDALOUSLY OBSEQUIOUS
313-127992-0058 THAN A CLASS OF COURTS THE MEMORY OF WHICH IS STILL AFTER THE LAPSE OF MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES HELD IN DEEP ABHORRENCE BY THE NATION FOREMOST AMONG THESE COURTS IN POWER AND IN INFAMY WERE THE STAR CHAMBER
313-127992-0059 AND THE HIGH COMMISSION THE FORMER A POLITICAL THE LATTER A RELIGIOUS INQUISITION NEITHER WAS A PART OF THE OLD CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND THE STAR CHAMBER HAD BEEN REMODELLED AND THE HIGH COMMISSION CREATED BY THE TUDORS
313-127992-0060 THE POWER WHICH THESE BOARDS HAD POSSESSED BEFORE THE ACCESSION OF CHARLES HAD BEEN EXTENSIVE AND FORMIDABLE BUT HAD BEEN SMALL INDEED WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH THEY NOW USURPED
313-127992-0061 GUIDED CHIEFLY BY THE VIOLENT SPIRIT OF THE PRIMATE AND FREE FROM THE CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT THEY DISPLAYED A RAPACITY A VIOLENCE A MALIGNANT ENERGY WHICH HAD BEEN UNKNOWN TO ANY FORMER AGE
313-127992-0062 TO FINE IMPRISON
313-127992-0063 A SEPARATE COUNCIL WHICH SATE AT YORK UNDER THE PRESIDENCY OF WENTWORTH WAS ARMED IN DEFIANCE OF LAW
313-127992-0064 WITH ALMOST BOUNDLESS POWER OVER THE NORTHERN COUNTIES ALL THESE TRIBUNALS INSULTED AND DEFIED THE AUTHORITY OF WESTMINSTER HALL AND DAILY COMMITTED EXCESSES WHICH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED ROYALISTS HAVE WARMLY CONDEMNED
313-127992-0065 WE ARE INFORMED BY CLARENDON THAT THERE WAS HARDLY A MAN OF NOTE IN THE REALM
313-127992-0066 AND GREEDINESS OF THE STAR CHAMBER
