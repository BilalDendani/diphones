4583-16044-0000 ENJOLRAS SAID TO THE SPY IT WILL BE YOUR TURN PRESENTLY DURING ALL THIS TIME LITTLE GAVROCHE
4583-16044-0001 JEAN PROUVAIRE COMBEFERRE JOLY BAHOREL BOSSUET AND ALL THE REST RAN TUMULTUOUSLY FROM THE WINE SHOP IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE THEY SAW A GLISTENING DENSITY OF BAYONETS UNDULATING ABOVE THE BARRICADE
4583-16044-0002 MUNICIPAL GUARDS OF LOFTY STATURE WERE MAKING THEIR WAY IN SOME STRIDING OVER THE OMNIBUS OTHERS THROUGH THE CUT THRUSTING BEFORE THEM THE URCHIN WHO RETREATED BUT DID NOT FLEE THE MOMENT WAS CRITICAL
4583-16044-0003 IT WAS THAT FIRST REDOUBTABLE MOMENT OF INUNDATION WHEN THE STREAM RISES TO THE LEVEL OF THE LEVEE AND WHEN THE WATER BEGINS TO FILTER THROUGH THE FISSURES OF DIKE
4583-16044-0004 BAHOREL DASHED UPON THE FIRST MUNICIPAL GUARD WHO WAS ENTERING AND KILLED HIM ON THE SPOT WITH A BLOW FROM HIS GUN
4583-16044-0005 THE LARGEST OF ALL A SORT OF COLOSSUS MARCHED ON GAVROCHE WITH HIS BAYONET FIXED THE URCHIN TOOK IN HIS ARMS JAVERT'S IMMENSE GUN LEVELLED IT RESOLUTELY AT THE GIANT AND FIRED NO DISCHARGE FOLLOWED JAVERT'S GUN WAS NOT LOADED
4583-16044-0006 THE MUNICIPAL GUARD BURST INTO A LAUGH AND RAISED HIS BAYONET AT THE CHILD BEFORE THE BAYONET HAD TOUCHED GAVROCHE THE GUN SLIPPED FROM THE SOLDIER'S GRASP A BULLET HAD STRUCK THE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMAN IN THE CENTRE OF THE FOREHEAD AND HE FELL OVER ON HIS BACK
4583-16044-0007 A SECOND BULLET STRUCK THE OTHER GUARD WHO HAD ASSAULTED COURFEYRAC IN THE BREAST AND LAID HIM LOW ON THE PAVEMENT
4583-16044-0008 CHAPTER FOUR THE BARREL OF POWDER MARIUS STILL CONCEALED IN THE TURN OF THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD WITNESSED SHUDDERING AND IRRESOLUTE THE FIRST PHASE OF THE COMBAT
4583-16044-0009 BUT HE HAD NOT LONG BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THAT MYSTERIOUS AND SOVEREIGN VERTIGO WHICH MAY BE DESIGNATED AS THE CALL OF THE ABYSS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE IMMINENCE OF THE PERIL
4583-16044-0010 THAT MELANCHOLY ENIGMA IN THE PRESENCE OF BAHOREL KILLED
4583-16044-0011 OF THAT CHILD THREATENED OF HIS FRIENDS TO SUCCOR OR TO AVENGE
4583-16044-0012 WITH HIS FIRST SHOT HE HAD SAVED GAVROCHE AND WITH THE SECOND DELIVERED COURFEYRAC AMID THE SOUND OF THE SHOTS AMID THE CRIES OF THE ASSAULTED GUARDS THE ASSAILANTS HAD CLIMBED THE ENTRENCHMENT ON WHOSE SUMMIT MUNICIPAL GUARDS SOLDIERS OF THE LINE
4583-16044-0013 AND NATIONAL GUARDS FROM THE SUBURBS COULD NOW BE SEEN GUN IN HAND REARING THEMSELVES TO MORE THAN HALF THE HEIGHT OF THEIR BODIES THEY ALREADY COVERED MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE BARRIER BUT THEY DID NOT LEAP INTO THE ENCLOSURE AS THOUGH WAVERING IN THE FEAR OF SOME TRAP
4583-16044-0014 THE LIGHT OF THE TORCH ILLUMINATED ONLY THEIR BAYONETS THEIR BEAR SKIN CAPS AND THE UPPER PART OF THEIR UNEASY AND ANGRY FACES MARIUS HAD NO LONGER ANY WEAPONS HE HAD FLUNG AWAY HIS DISCHARGED PISTOLS AFTER FIRING THEM
4583-16044-0015 AS HE TURNED HALF ROUND GAZING IN THAT DIRECTION A SOLDIER TOOK AIM AT HIM AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE SOLDIER WAS SIGHTING MARIUS A HAND WAS LAID ON THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN AND OBSTRUCTED IT THIS WAS DONE BY SOME ONE WHO HAD DARTED FORWARD THE YOUNG WORKMAN IN VELVET TROUSERS
4583-16044-0016 THE SHOT SPED TRAVERSED THE HAND AND POSSIBLY ALSO THE WORKMAN SINCE HE FELL BUT THE BALL DID NOT STRIKE MARIUS ALL THIS WHICH WAS RATHER TO BE APPREHENDED THAN SEEN THROUGH THE SMOKE MARIUS WHO WAS ENTERING THE TAP ROOM HARDLY NOTICED
4583-16044-0017 STILL HE HAD IN A CONFUSED WAY PERCEIVED THAT GUN BARREL AIMED AT HIM AND THE HAND WHICH HAD BLOCKED IT AND HE HAD HEARD THE DISCHARGE BUT IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS THE THINGS WHICH ONE SEES VACILLATE AND ARE PRECIPITATED AND ONE PAUSES FOR NOTHING
4583-16044-0018 ONE FEELS OBSCURELY IMPELLED TOWARDS MORE DARKNESS STILL AND ALL IS CLOUD THE INSURGENTS SURPRISED BUT NOT TERRIFIED HAD RALLIED ENJOLRAS HAD SHOUTED WAIT DON'T FIRE AT RANDOM
4583-16044-0019 IN THE FIRST CONFUSION THEY MIGHT IN FACT WOUND EACH OTHER THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAD ASCENDED TO THE WINDOW ON THE FIRST STORY AND TO THE ATTIC WINDOWS WHENCE THEY COMMANDED THE ASSAILANTS THE MOST DETERMINED
4583-16044-0020 HAD PROUDLY PLACED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE HOUSES AT THE REAR UNSHELTERED AND FACING THE RANKS OF SOLDIERS AND GUARDS WHO CROWNED THE BARRICADE ALL THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT HASTE WITH THAT STRANGE AND THREATENING GRAVITY WHICH PRECEDES ENGAGEMENTS THEY TOOK AIM
4583-16044-0021 POINT BLANK ON BOTH SIDES THEY WERE SO CLOSE THAT THEY COULD TALK TOGETHER WITHOUT RAISING THEIR VOICES WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THIS POINT WHERE THE SPARK IS ON THE BRINK OF DARTING FORTH
4583-16044-0022 FIRE REPLIED ENJOLRAS THE TWO DISCHARGES TOOK PLACE AT THE SAME MOMENT AND ALL DISAPPEARED IN SMOKE AN ACRID AND STIFLING SMOKE IN WHICH DYING AND WOUNDED LAY WITH WEAK DULL GROANS WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED AWAY
4583-16044-0023 THE COMBATANTS ON BOTH SIDES COULD BE SEEN TO BE THINNED OUT BUT STILL IN THE SAME POSITIONS RELOADING IN SILENCE ALL AT ONCE A THUNDERING VOICE WAS HEARD SHOUTING
4583-16044-0024 ALL TURNED IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THE VOICE PROCEEDED MARIUS HAD ENTERED THE TAP ROOM AND HAD SEIZED THE BARREL OF POWDER THEN HE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE SMOKE AND THE SORT OF OBSCURE MIST WHICH FILLED THE ENTRENCHED ENCLOSURE TO GLIDE ALONG THE BARRICADE
4583-16044-0025 AS FAR AS THAT CAGE OF PAVING STONES WHERE THE TORCH WAS FIXED TO TEAR IT FROM THE TORCH TO REPLACE IT BY THE BARREL OF POWDER TO THRUST THE PILE OF STONES UNDER THE BARREL WHICH WAS INSTANTLY STAVED IN WITH A SORT OF HORRIBLE OBEDIENCE
4583-16044-0026 ALL THIS HAD COST MARIUS BUT THE TIME NECESSARY TO STOOP AND RISE AGAIN AND NOW ALL NATIONAL GUARDS MUNICIPAL GUARDS OFFICERS SOLDIERS
4583-16044-0027 HIS HAUGHTY FACE ILLUMINATED BY A FATAL RESOLUTION
4583-16044-0028 WHERE THEY COULD MAKE OUT THE BROKEN BARREL OF POWDER AND GIVING VENT TO THAT STARTLING CRY BE OFF WITH YOU OR I'LL BLOW UP THE BARRICADE MARIUS ON THAT BARRICADE AFTER THE OCTOGENARIAN WAS THE VISION OF THE YOUNG REVOLUTION AFTER THE APPARITION OF THE OLD
4583-16044-0029 BLOW UP THE BARRICADE SAID A SERGEANT AND YOURSELF WITH IT MARIUS RETORTED AND MYSELF ALSO
4583-16044-0030 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ONE ON THE BARRIER THE ASSAILANTS ABANDONING THEIR DEAD AND WOUNDED FLOWED BACK PELL MELL AND IN DISORDER TOWARDS THE EXTREMITY OF THE STREET AND THERE WERE AGAIN LOST IN THE NIGHT IT WAS A HEADLONG FLIGHT THE BARRICADE
4583-16044-0031 WAS FREE CHAPTER FIVE END OF THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE ALL FLOCKED AROUND MARIUS COURFEYRAC FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS NECK HERE YOU ARE WHAT LUCK SAID COMBEFERRE YOU CAME IN OPPORTUNELY EJACULATED BOSSUET
4583-16044-0032 MARIUS ASKED WHERE IS THE CHIEF YOU ARE HE SAID ENJOLRAS
4583-16044-0033 PRODUCED ON HIM THE EFFECT OF BEING OUTSIDE OF HIM AND OF BEARING HIM AWAY IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY AT AN IMMENSE DISTANCE FROM LIFE HIS TWO LUMINOUS MONTHS OF JOY AND LOVE ENDING ABRUPTLY AT THAT FRIGHTFUL PRECIPICE
4583-16044-0034 HIMSELF THE LEADER OF THE INSURGENTS ALL THESE THINGS APPEARED TO HIM LIKE A TREMENDOUS NIGHTMARE HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE A MENTAL EFFORT TO RECALL THE FACT THAT ALL THAT SURROUNDED HIM WAS REAL
4583-16044-0035 MARIUS HAD ALREADY SEEN TOO MUCH OF LIFE NOT TO KNOW THAT NOTHING IS MORE IMMINENT THAN THE IMPOSSIBLE
4583-16044-0036 HE HAD LOOKED ON AT HIS OWN DRAMA AS A PIECE WHICH ONE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
4583-16044-0037 HAD NOT SO MUCH AS MOVED HIS HEAD DURING THE WHOLE OF THE ATTACK ON THE BARRICADE AND WHO HAD GAZED ON THE REVOLT SEETHING AROUND HIM WITH THE RESIGNATION OF A MARTYR AND THE MAJESTY OF A JUDGE MARIUS HAD NOT EVEN SEEN HIM IN THE MEANWHILE THE ASSAILANTS DID NOT STIR
4583-16044-0038 THEY COULD BE HEARD MARCHING AND SWARMING THROUGH AT THE END OF THE STREET BUT THEY DID NOT VENTURE INTO IT EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE AWAITING ORDERS OR BECAUSE THEY WERE AWAITING REINFORCEMENTS BEFORE HURLING THEMSELVES AFRESH ON THIS IMPREGNABLE REDOUBT
4583-16044-0039 THE INSURGENTS HAD POSTED SENTINELS AND SOME OF THEM WHO WERE MEDICAL STUDENTS SET ABOUT CARING FOR THE WOUNDED THEY HAD THROWN THE TABLES OUT OF THE WINE SHOP WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TWO TABLES RESERVED FOR LINT AND CARTRIDGES AND
4583-16044-0040 AND HER SERVANTS ON THESE MATTRESSES THEY HAD LAID THE WOUNDED AS FOR THE THREE POOR CREATURES WHO INHABITED CORINTHE NO ONE KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEM THEY WERE FINALLY FOUND HOWEVER HIDDEN IN THE CELLAR
4583-16044-0041 A POIGNANT EMOTION CLOUDED THE JOY OF THE DISENCUMBERED BARRICADE THE ROLL WAS CALLED ONE OF THE INSURGENTS WAS MISSING AND WHO WAS IT ONE OF THE DEAREST ONE OF THE MOST VALIANT JEAN PROUVAIRE
4583-16044-0042 HE WAS SOUGHT AMONG THE WOUNDED HE WAS NOT THERE HE WAS SOUGHT AMONG THE DEAD HE WAS NOT THERE HE WAS EVIDENTLY A PRISONER COMBEFERRE SAID TO ENJOLRAS THEY HAVE OUR FRIEND

4583-16044-0045 TO OFFER TO EXCHANGE OUR MAN FOR THEIRS LISTEN SAID ENJOLRAS LAYING HIS HAND ON COMBEFERRE'S ARM AT THE END OF THE STREET THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CLASH OF ARMS THEY HEARD A MANLY VOICE SHOUT
4583-16044-0046 THEY RECOGNIZED THE VOICE OF PROUVAIRE A FLASH PASSED A REPORT RANG OUT SILENCE FELL AGAIN THEY HAVE KILLED HIM EXCLAIMED COMBEFERRE ENJOLRAS GLANCED AT JAVERT AND SAID TO HIM
