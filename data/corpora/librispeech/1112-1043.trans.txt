1112-1043-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN A SPRAINED ANKLE I WAS PANIC STRICKEN AS I RAN ALONG THE CORRIDOR I WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE MYSTERIOUS INTRUDER AND PROBABLE MURDERER HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT HE LAY DEAD OR DYING AT THE FOOT OF THE CHUTE I GOT DOWN THE STAIRCASE SOMEHOW AND THROUGH THE KITCHEN TO THE BASEMENT STAIRS
1112-1043-0001 MISTER JAMIESON HAD BEEN BEFORE ME AND THE DOOR STOOD OPEN LIDDY WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KITCHEN HOLDING A FRYING PAN BY THE HANDLE AS A WEAPON DON'T GO DOWN THERE SHE YELLED WHEN SHE SAW ME MOVING TOWARD THE BASEMENT STAIRS
1112-1043-0002 I SAID SHARPLY COME DOWN WITH US AND TURN ON ALL THE LIGHTS SHE OFFERED HER RESIGNATION AS USUAL ON THE SPOT BUT I TOOK HER BY THE ARM AND SHE CAME ALONG FINALLY SHE SWITCHED ON ALL THE LIGHTS AND POINTED TO A DOOR JUST AHEAD THAT'S THE DOOR SHE SAID SULKILY
1112-1043-0003 THE KEY'S IN IT BUT THE KEY WAS NOT IN IT MISTER JAMIESON SHOOK IT BUT IT WAS A HEAVY DOOR WELL LOCKED AND THEN HE STOOPED AND BEGAN PUNCHING AROUND THE KEYHOLE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL WHEN HE STOOD UP HIS FACE WAS EXULTANT
1112-1043-0004 IT'S LOCKED ON THE INSIDE HE SAID IN A LOW TONE
1112-1043-0005 THAT IS UNLESS YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY ONE CROSSING THE LAWN OR SKULKING AROUND THE HOUSE DID YOU
1112-1043-0006 BUT THE IRON GATES ONCE CLOSED AND TENDED BY THE LODGE KEEPER NOW STOOD PERMANENTLY OPEN THE DAY OF THE MOTOR CAR HAD COME NO ONE HAD TIME FOR CLOSED GATES AND LODGE KEEPERS THE LODGE AT SUNNYSIDE WAS MERELY A SORT OF SUPPLEMENTARY SERVANTS QUARTERS IT WAS AS CONVENIENT IN ITS APPOINTMENTS AS THE BIG HOUSE AND INFINITELY MORE COZY
1112-1043-0007 AS I WENT DOWN THE DRIVE MY THOUGHTS WERE BUSY WHO WOULD IT BE THAT MISTER JAMIESON HAD TRAPPED IN THE CELLAR WOULD WE FIND A BODY OR SOME ONE BADLY INJURED SCARCELY EITHER WHOEVER HAD FALLEN HAD BEEN ABLE TO LOCK THE LAUNDRY DOOR ON THE INSIDE IF THE FUGITIVE HAD COME FROM OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
1112-1043-0008 HOW DID HE GET IN IF IT WAS SOME MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN AND THEN A FEELING OF HORROR ALMOST OVERWHELMED ME GERTRUDE GERTRUDE AND HER INJURED ANKLE GERTRUDE FOUND LIMPING SLOWLY UP THE DRIVE WHEN I HAD THOUGHT SHE WAS IN BED
1112-1043-0009 I TRIED TO PUT THE THOUGHT AWAY BUT IT WOULD NOT GO IF GERTRUDE HAD BEEN ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT NIGHT WHY HAD SHE FLED FROM MISTER JAMIESON THE IDEA PUZZLING AS IT WAS SEEMED BORNE OUT BY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WHOEVER HAD TAKEN REFUGE AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS
1112-1043-0010 AND YET EVERY WAY I TURNED I SEEMED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT POINTED TO SUCH A CONNECTION
1112-1043-0011 HE DID HE ABSOLUTELY DISAPPEARED IN THE DUSK WITHOUT MY GETTING MORE THAN A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE I HAD A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF UNFAMILIAR FEATURES AND OF A SORT OF CAP WITH A VISOR THEN HE WAS GONE I WENT TO THE LODGE AND RAPPED
1112-1043-0012 IT REQUIRED TWO OR THREE POUNDINGS TO BRING THOMAS TO THE DOOR AND HE OPENED IT ONLY AN INCH OR SO WHERE IS WARNER I ASKED I
1112-1043-0013 IT WAS SO EVIDENT THAT THOMAS DID NOT WANT ME INSIDE THAT I WENT IN TELL WARNER HE IS NEEDED IN A HURRY I REPEATED AND TURNED INTO THE LITTLE SITTING ROOM I COULD HEAR THOMAS GOING UP THE STAIRS COULD HEAR HIM ROUSE WARNER AND THE STEPS OF THE CHAUFFEUR AS HE HURRIEDLY DRESSED BUT MY ATTENTION WAS BUSY WITH THE ROOM BELOW
1112-1043-0014 ON THE CENTER TABLE OPEN WAS A SEALSKIN TRAVELING BAG IT WAS FILLED WITH GOLD TOPPED BOTTLES AND BRUSHES AND IT BREATHED OPULENCE LUXURY FEMININITY FROM EVERY INCH OF SURFACE
1112-1043-0015 HE WAS COMPLETELY BUT SOMEWHAT INCONGRUOUSLY DRESSED AND HIS OPEN BOYISH FACE LOOKED ABASHED
1112-1043-0016 AND EARN GOOD SALARIES IN A CONGENIAL OCCUPATION
1112-1043-0017 MISTER JAMIESON WANTS YOU TO HELP HIM BREAK THE LOCK WARNER WHOSE BAG IS THIS HE WAS IN THE DOORWAY BY THIS TIME AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR WARNER I CALLED COME BACK HERE WHOSE BAG IS THIS
1112-1043-0018 IT BELONGS TO THOMAS HE SAID AND FLED UP THE DRIVE TO THOMAS A LONDON BAG WITH MIRRORS AND COSMETIC JARS OF WHICH THOMAS COULD NOT EVEN HAVE GUESSED THE USE
1112-1043-0019 HOWEVER I PUT THE BAG IN THE BACK OF MY MIND WHICH WAS FAST BECOMING STORED WITH ANOMALOUS AND APPARENTLY IRRECONCILABLE FACTS AND FOLLOWED WARNER TO THE HOUSE LIDDY HAD COME BACK TO THE KITCHEN
1112-1043-0020 THE DOOR TO THE BASEMENT STAIRS WAS DOUBLE BARRED AND HAD A TABLE PUSHED AGAINST IT AND BESIDE HER ON THE TABLE WAS MOST OF THE KITCHEN PARAPHERNALIA DID YOU SEE IF THERE WAS ANY ONE MISSING IN THE HOUSE I ASKED IGNORING THE ARRAY OF SAUCE PANS ROLLING PINS AND THE POKER OF THE RANGE
1112-1043-0021 ROSIE IS MISSING LIDDY SAID WITH UNCTION SHE HAD OBJECTED TO ROSIE THE PARLOR MAID FROM THE START MISSUS WATSON WENT INTO HER ROOM AND FOUND SHE HAD GONE WITHOUT HER HAT
1112-1043-0022 PEOPLE THAT TRUST THEMSELVES A DOZEN MILES FROM THE CITY IN STRANGE HOUSES WITH SERVANTS THEY DON'T KNOW NEEDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY WAKE UP SOME MORNING AND FIND THEIR THROATS CUT AFTER WHICH CAREFULLY VEILED SARCASM LIDDY RELAPSED INTO GLOOM
1112-1043-0023 WARNER CAME IN THEN WITH A HANDFUL OF SMALL TOOLS AND MISTER JAMIESON WENT WITH HIM TO THE BASEMENT ODDLY ENOUGH I WAS NOT ALARMED WITH ALL MY HEART I WISHED FOR HALSEY BUT I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED AT THE DOOR HE WAS TO FORCE WARNER PUT DOWN HIS TOOLS AND LOOKED AT IT
1112-1043-0024 THEN HE TURNED THE HANDLE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY THE DOOR OPENED REVEALING THE BLACKNESS OF THE DRYING ROOM BEYOND MISTER JAMIESON GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF DISGUST GONE HE SAID
1112-1043-0025 CONFOUND SUCH CARELESS WORK I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT WAS TRUE ENOUGH WE GOT THE LIGHTS ON FINALLY AND LOOKED ALL THROUGH THE THREE ROOMS THAT CONSTITUTED THIS WING OF THE BASEMENT EVERYTHING WAS QUIET AND EMPTY
1112-1043-0026 AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE FUGITIVE HAD ESCAPED INJURY WAS FOUND IN A HEAPED UP BASKET OF CLOTHES UNDER THE CHUTE THE BASKET HAD BEEN OVERTURNED BUT THAT WAS ALL MISTER JAMIESON EXAMINED THE WINDOWS ONE WAS UNLOCKED AND OFFERED AN EASY ESCAPE
1112-1043-0027 THE WINDOW OR THE DOOR WHICH WAY HAD THE FUGITIVE ESCAPED THE DOOR SEEMED MOST PROBABLE AND I HOPED IT HAD BEEN SO I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE JUST THEN TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY POOR GERTRUDE WE HAD BEEN HOUNDING THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND YET
1112-1043-0028 I HAD MET GERTRUDE NOT FAR FROM THAT VERY WINDOW I WENT UP STAIRS AT LAST TIRED AND DEPRESSED MISSUS WATSON AND LIDDY WERE MAKING TEA IN THE KITCHEN IN CERTAIN WALKS OF LIFE THE TEA POT IS THE REFUGE IN TIMES OF STRESS TROUBLE OR SICKNESS
1112-1043-0029 THEY GIVE TEA TO THE DYING AND THEY PUT IT IN THE BABY'S NURSING BOTTLE MISSUS WATSON WAS FIXING A TRAY TO BE SENT IN TO ME AND WHEN I ASKED HER ABOUT ROSIE SHE CONFIRMED HER ABSENCE SHE'S NOT HERE SHE SAID BUT I WOULD NOT THINK MUCH OF THAT MISS INNES
1112-1043-0030 ROSIE IS A PRETTY YOUNG GIRL AND PERHAPS SHE HAS A SWEETHEART IT WILL BE A GOOD THING IF SHE HAS THE MAIDS STAY MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HOLD THEM HERE GERTRUDE HAD GONE BACK TO HER ROOM AND WHILE I WAS DRINKING MY CUP OF HOT TEA
1112-1043-0031 MISTER JAMIESON CAME IN WE MIGHT TAKE UP THE CONVERSATION WHERE WE LEFT OFF AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO HE SAID BUT BEFORE WE GO ON I WANT TO SAY THIS THE PERSON WHO ESCAPED FROM THE LAUNDRY WAS A WOMAN WITH A FOOT OF MODERATE SIZE AND WELL ARCHED
1112-1043-0032 SHE WORE NOTHING BUT A STOCKING ON HER RIGHT FOOT AND IN SPITE OF THE UNLOCKED DOOR SHE ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW AND AGAIN I THOUGHT OF GERTRUDE'S SPRAINED ANKLE
