3793-4707-0023 AND THE KING OF NORTHUMBERLAND RIGHT STRAIT CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR HOW KING ARTHUR MARVELLED MUCH OF THE JOUSTING IN THE FIELD AND HOW HE RODE AND FOUND SIR LAUNCELOT
3793-4707-0024 SO THIS TOURNAMENT AND THIS JOUSTS DURED LONG TILL IT WAS NEAR NIGHT FOR THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE RELIEVED EVER UNTO KING ARTHUR FOR THE KING WAS WROTH OUT OF MEASURE THAT HE AND HIS KNIGHTS MIGHT NOT PREVAIL THAT DAY THEN SIR GAWAINE SAID TO THE KING
3793-4707-0025 THEY BE NOT ABOUT YOU IT IS FOR SOME CAUSE SAID SIR GAWAINE BY MY HEAD SAID SIR KAY SIR BORS IS YONDER ALL THIS DAY UPON THE RIGHT HAND OF THIS FIELD AND THERE HE AND HIS BLOOD DO MORE WORSHIPFULLY THAN WE DO
3793-4707-0026 I SEE WELL BY HIS RIDING AND BY HIS GREAT STROKES AND THE OTHER KNIGHT IN THE SAME COLOURS IS THE GOOD YOUNG KNIGHT SIR LAVAINE ALSO THAT KNIGHT WITH THE GREEN SHIELD IS MY BROTHER SIR GARETH AND YET HE HATH DISGUISED HIMSELF
3793-4707-0027 FOR NO MAN SHALL NEVER MAKE HIM BE AGAINST SIR LAUNCELOT BECAUSE HE MADE HIM KNIGHT
3793-4707-0028 NEPHEW I BELIEVE YOU THEREFORE TELL ME NOW WHAT IS YOUR BEST COUNSEL SIR SAID SIR GAWAINE YE SHALL HAVE MY COUNSEL LET BLOW UNTO LODGING FOR AN HE BE SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE AND MY BROTHER SIR GARETH WITH HIM WITH THE HELP OF THAT GOOD YOUNG KNIGHT SIR LAVAINE
3793-4707-0029 TRUST ME TRULY IT WILL BE NO BOOT TO STRIVE WITH THEM BUT IF WE SHOULD FALL TEN OR TWELVE UPON ONE KNIGHT AND THAT WERE NO WORSHIP BUT SHAME YE SAY TRUTH SAID THE KING AND FOR TO SAY SOOTH SAID THE KING
3793-4707-0030 IT WERE SHAME TO US SO MANY AS WE BE TO SET UPON THEM ANY MORE FOR WIT YE WELL SAID KING ARTHUR THEY BE THREE GOOD KNIGHTS AND NAMELY THAT KNIGHT WITH THE SLEEVE OF GOLD SO THEN THEY BLEW UNTO LODGING
3793-4707-0031 BUT FORTHWITHAL KING ARTHUR LET SEND UNTO THE FOUR KINGS AND TO THE MIGHTY DUKE AND PRAYED THEM THAT THE KNIGHT WITH THE SLEEVE OF GOLD DEPART NOT FROM THEM BUT THAT THE KING MAY SPEAK WITH HIM THEN FORTHWITHAL KING ARTHUR ALIGHTED AND UNARMED HIM
3793-4707-0032 AND TOOK A LITTLE HACKNEY AND RODE AFTER SIR LAUNCELOT FOR EVER HE HAD A SPY UPON HIM
3793-4707-0033 AND THERE THE KING PRAYED THEM ALL UNTO SUPPER
3793-4707-0034 ALSO ARTHUR BLAMED SIR GARETH BECAUSE HE LEFT HIS FELLOWSHIP AND HELD WITH SIR LAUNCELOT MY LORD SAID SIR GARETH HE MADE ME A KNIGHT AND WHEN I SAW HIM SO HARD BESTEAD METHOUGHT IT WAS MY WORSHIP TO HELP HIM
3793-4707-0035 AND SO MANY NOBLE KNIGHTS AGAINST HIM AND WHEN I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE I SHAMED TO SEE SO MANY KNIGHTS AGAINST HIM ALONE TRULY SAID KING ARTHUR UNTO SIR GARETH YE SAY WELL AND WORSHIPFULLY HAVE YE DONE
3793-4707-0036 AND TO YOURSELF GREAT WORSHIP AND ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE SAID KING ARTHUR UNTO SIR GARETH WIT YOU WELL I SHALL LOVE YOU AND TRUST YOU THE MORE BETTER FOR EVER SAID ARTHUR IT IS A WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT'S DEED TO HELP ANOTHER WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT WHEN HE SEETH HIM IN A GREAT DANGER
3793-4707-0037 FOR EVER A WORSHIPFUL MAN WILL BE LOATH TO SEE A WORSHIPFUL MAN SHAMED AND HE THAT IS OF NO WORSHIP AND FARETH WITH COWARDICE NEVER SHALL HE SHOW GENTLENESS NOR NO MANNER OF GOODNESS WHERE HE SEETH A MAN IN ANY DANGER
3793-4707-0038 FOR THEN EVER WILL A COWARD SHOW NO MERCY AND ALWAYS A GOOD MAN WILL DO EVER TO ANOTHER MAN AS HE WOULD BE DONE TO HIMSELF SO THEN THERE WERE GREAT FEASTS UNTO KINGS AND DUKES AND REVEL GAME AND PLAY AND ALL MANNER OF NOBLESSE WAS USED
3793-4707-0039 AND HE THAT WAS COURTEOUS TRUE AND FAITHFUL TO HIS FRIEND WAS THAT TIME CHERISHED CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE HOW TRUE LOVE IS LIKENED TO SUMMER AND THUS IT PASSED ON FROM CANDLEMASS UNTIL AFTER EASTER THAT THE MONTH OF MAY WAS COME
3793-4707-0040 WHEN EVERY LUSTY HEART BEGINNETH TO BLOSSOM AND TO BRING FORTH FRUIT FOR LIKE AS HERBS AND TREES BRING FORTH FRUIT AND FLOURISH IN MAY IN LIKE WISE EVERY LUSTY HEART THAT IS IN ANY MANNER A LOVER SPRINGETH AND FLOURISHETH IN LUSTY DEEDS
3793-4707-0041 THAT LUSTY MONTH OF MAY IN SOMETHING TO CONSTRAIN HIM TO SOME MANNER OF THING MORE IN THAT MONTH THAN IN ANY OTHER MONTH FOR DIVERS CAUSES FOR THEN ALL HERBS AND TREES RENEW A MAN AND WOMAN
3793-4707-0042 FOR IN MANY PERSONS THERE IS NO STABILITY FOR WE MAY SEE ALL DAY FOR A LITTLE BLAST OF WINTER'S RASURE ANON WE SHALL DEFACE AND LAY APART TRUE LOVE FOR LITTLE OR NOUGHT THAT COST MUCH THING THIS IS NO WISDOM NOR STABILITY
3793-4707-0043 WHOSOMEVER USETH THIS THEREFORE LIKE AS MAY MONTH FLOWERETH AND FLOURISHETH IN MANY GARDENS SO IN LIKE WISE LET EVERY MAN OF WORSHIP FLOURISH HIS HEART IN THIS WORLD FIRST UNTO GOD AND NEXT UNTO THE JOY OF THEM THAT HE PROMISED HIS FAITH UNTO
3793-4707-0044 FOR THERE WAS NEVER WORSHIPFUL MAN OR WORSHIPFUL WOMAN BUT THEY LOVED ONE BETTER THAN ANOTHER AND WORSHIP IN ARMS MAY NEVER BE FOILED BUT FIRST RESERVE THE HONOUR TO GOD AND SECONDLY THE QUARREL MUST COME OF THY LADY AND SUCH LOVE I CALL VIRTUOUS LOVE
3793-4707-0045 BUT NOWADAYS MEN CAN NOT LOVE SEVEN NIGHT BUT THEY MUST HAVE ALL THEIR DESIRES THAT LOVE MAY NOT ENDURE BY REASON FOR WHERE THEY BE SOON ACCORDED AND HASTY HEAT SOON IT COOLETH RIGHT SO FARETH LOVE NOWADAYS SOON HOT SOON COLD THIS IS NO STABILITY
3793-4707-0046 BUT THE OLD LOVE WAS NOT SO MEN AND WOMEN COULD LOVE TOGETHER SEVEN YEARS AND NO LICOURS LUSTS WERE BETWEEN THEM AND THEN WAS LOVE TRUTH AND FAITHFULNESS AND LO IN LIKE WISE WAS USED LOVE IN KING ARTHUR'S DAYS
