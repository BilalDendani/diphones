8197-278214-0000 THERE WAS NO SUNSHINE UPON LAURA DUNBAR'S WEDDING MORNING THE WINTRY SKY WAS LOW AND DARK AS IF THE HEAVENS HAD BEEN COMING GRADUALLY DOWN TO CRUSH THIS WICKED EARTH THE DAMP FOG THE SLOW
8197-278214-0001 DRIZZLING RAIN SHUT OUT THE FAIR LANDSCAPE UPON WHICH THE BANKER'S DAUGHTER HAD BEEN WONT TO LOOK FROM THE PLEASANT CUSHIONED SEAT IN THE DEEP BAY WINDOW OF HER DRESSING ROOM THE BROAD LAWN WAS SODDENED BY THAT PERPETUAL RAIN
8197-278214-0002 THE INCESSANT RAIN DROPS DRIPPED FROM THE LOW BRANCHES OF THE BLACK SPREADING CEDARS OF LEBANON THE SMOOTH BEADS OF WATER RAN OFF THE SHINING LAUREL LEAVES THE RHODODENDRONS THE FEATHERY FURZE
8197-278214-0003 EVERYTHING WAS OBSCURED BY THAT CRUEL RAIN THE WATER GUSHED OUT OF THE QUAINT DRAGONS MOUTHS RANGED ALONG THE PARAPET OF THE ABBEY ROOF IT DRIPPED FROM EVERY STONE COPING AND ABUTMENT FROM WINDOW LEDGE AND PORCH FROM GABLE END AND SHELTERING IVY
8197-278214-0004 THE RAIN WAS EVERYWHERE AND THE INCESSANT PITTER PATTER OF THE DROPS BEATING AGAINST THE WINDOWS OF THE ABBEY MADE A DISMAL SOUND
8197-278214-0005 WHICH TO DAY HAD THE SOUND OF HUMAN VOICES NOW MOANING DREARILY WITH A LONG LOW WAILING MURMUR NOW SHRIEKING IN THE SHRILLY TONES OF AN ANGRY VIXEN
8197-278214-0006 SHE WAS A PETTED HEIRESS REMEMBER AND THE WORLD HAD GONE SO SMOOTHLY WITH HER HITHERTO THAT PERHAPS SHE SCARCELY ENDURED CALAMITY OR CONTRADICTION WITH SO GOOD A GRACE AS SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD SHE BEEN A LITTLE NEARER PERFECTION
8197-278214-0007 SHE WAS HARDLY BETTER THAN A CHILD AS YET WITH ALL A CHILD'S IGNORANT HOPEFULNESS AND BLIND TRUST IN THE UNKNOWN FUTURE SHE WAS A PAMPERED CHILD AND SHE EXPECTED TO HAVE LIFE MADE VERY SMOOTH FOR HER
8197-278214-0008 MISSUS MADDEN WAS BUSTLING ABOUT ARRANGING HER YOUNG MISTRESS'S BREAKFAST UPON A LITTLE TABLE NEAR THE BLAZING FIRE LAURA HAD JUST EMERGED FROM HER BATH ROOM AND HAD PUT ON A LOOSE DRESSING GOWN OF WADDED BLUE SILK PRIOR TO THE GRAND CEREMONIAL OF THE WEDDING TOILET
8197-278214-0009 WHICH WAS NOT TO TAKE PLACE UNTIL AFTER BREAKFAST I THINK MISS DUNBAR LOOKED LOVELIER IN THIS DESHABILLE THAN MANY A BRIDE IN HER LACE AND ORANGE BLOSSOMS THE GIRL'S LONG GOLDEN HAIR WET FROM THE BATH HUNG IN RIPPLING CONFUSION ABOUT HER FRESH YOUNG FACE
8197-278214-0010 TWO LITTLE FEET CARELESSLY THRUST INTO BLUE MOROCCO SLIPPERS PEEPED OUT FROM AMONGST THE FOLDS OF MISS DUNBAR'S DRESSING GOWN AND ONE COQUETTISH SCARLET HEEL TAPPED IMPATIENTLY UPON THE FLOOR AS THE YOUNG LADY WATCHED THAT PROVOKING RAIN
8197-278214-0011 WHAT A WRETCHED MORNING SHE SAID WELL MISS LAURA IT IS RATHER WET REPLIED MISSUS MADDEN IN A CONCILIATING TONE RATHER WET ECHOED LAURA WITH AN AIR OF VEXATION

8197-278214-0015 BUT WHAT'S A LITTLE RAIN MORE OR LESS TO YOU MISS LAURA WHEN YOU'VE GOT MORE CARRIAGES TO RIDE IN THAN IF YOU WAS A PRINCESS IN A FAIRY TALE WHICH I THINK THE PRINCESS BALTROUBADORE

8197-278214-0034 LAURA DUNBAR TOOK VERY LITTLE NOTICE OF HER NURSE'S RAMBLING DISCOURSE AND I AM FAIN TO CONFESS THAT UPON THIS OCCASION MISSUS MADDEN TALKED RATHER MORE FOR THE SAKE OF TALKING THAN FROM ANY OVERFLOW OF ANIMAL SPIRITS
8197-278214-0035 THE GOOD CREATURE FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THE COLD WET CHEERLESS MORNING QUITE AS KEENLY AS HER MISTRESS MISSUS MADDEN WAS SUPERSTITIOUS AS MOST IGNORANT AND SIMPLE MINDED PEOPLE GENERALLY ARE MORE OR LESS SUPERSTITION IS AFTER ALL ONLY A DIM
8197-278214-0036 EXCEPT IN SUCH VERY HARD PRACTICAL MINDS AS ARE INCAPABLE OF BELIEVING IN ANYTHING NOT EVEN IN HEAVEN ITSELF
