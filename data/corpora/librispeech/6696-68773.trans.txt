6696-68773-0000 LUCY'S GHOST KENNETH HAD SENT WORD TO TOM GATES ASKING THE YOUNG MAN TO COME TO ELMHURST BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWO DAYS AFTER THE LAWN PARTY THAT TOM APPEARED AND ASKED PERMISSION TO SEE MISTER FORBES BETH AND LOUISE WERE WITH KENNETH AT THE TIME
6696-68773-0001 AND WERE EAGER TO REMAIN DURING THE INTERVIEW SO THE YOUNG MAN WAS SHOWN INTO THE LIBRARY BETH COULD SCARCELY RECOGNIZE IN HIM THE CALM AND CHEERFUL TOM GATES THEY HAD VISITED IN THE COUNTY JAIL FOR HIS FACE WAS DRAWN WITH CARE AND ANXIETY EYES WERE BLOODSHOT
6696-68773-0002 AND HIS FORMER NEAT APPEARANCE WAS CHANGED TO ONE CARELESS AND UNTIDY KENNETH SCRUTINIZED HIM CLOSELY WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO TOM HE ASKED I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR LUCY SIR NIGHT AND DAY
6696-68773-0003 I HAVEN'T SLEPT A WINK SINCE I HEARD THE AWFUL NEWS OF HER SICKNESS AND ESCAPE WHERE DO YOU THINK SHE CAN BE SIR HIS QUESTION WAS FULL OF AGONIZED ENTREATY AND HIS MANNER PITIFULLY APPEALING I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED KENNETH
6696-68773-0004 SHE WAS SUCH A GENTLE SHRINKING GIRL AS SHY AND RETIRING AS A CHILD AND SHE NEVER DID A THING THAT WOULD CAUSE ANYONE THE LEAST WORRY OR UNHAPPINESS BUT SHE WAS OUT OF HER HEAD SIR AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT THAT WAS THE REASON SHE WENT AWAY
6696-68773-0005 I THOUGHT TO SAVE HER AND DROVE HER MAD INSTEAD YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT DECLARED KENNETH A GIRL OF HER CHARACTER SENSITIVE TO A FAULT WOULD BE GREATLY SHOCKED TO FIND THE MAN SHE LOVED A CRIMINAL IT WAS FOR HER SAKE THAT IS A POOR EXCUSE
6696-68773-0006 IF YOU HAD WAITED LUCY WOULD HAVE PROVED HER INNOCENCE THEY THREATENED TO ARREST HER SIR IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HER THEY WOULDN'T DARE ARREST HER ON SUSPICION
6696-68773-0007 THE SQUIERSES WOULD DARE DO ANYTHING YOU DON'T KNOW OLD MISSUS SQUIERS I KNOW THE LAW SIR AND IN ANY EVENT IT WAS A FOOLISH THING AS WELL AS CRIMINAL TO FORGE A CHECK TO GET THE MONEY THEY DEMANDED
6696-68773-0008 AND PRETTY SOON YOU'LL BE MAD YOURSELF IF LUCY IS FOUND DO YOU WANT HER TO SEE YOU IN THIS CONDITION CAN SHE BE FOUND SIR DO YOU THINK WE ARE TRYING TO FIND HER REPLIED KENNETH YOU HAVE FAILED IT SEEMS
6696-68773-0009 AND WILL ROGERS HAD FAILED I'VE HAD ONE OF THE CLEVEREST DETECTIVES OF CHICAGO TRYING TO FIND HER FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS
6696-68773-0010 IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE DETECTIVE THAT CAME TO SEE MISSUS ROGERS SAID TOM MUSINGLY SHE TOLD ME A STRANGE MAN HAD BEEN THERE FROM MISTER FORBES TO INQUIRE ALL ABOUT LUCY
6696-68773-0011 THEN YOU MUST SHOW IT BY BEING A MAN AND NOT BY GIVING WAY TO YOUR TROUBLE IN THIS FOOLISH MANNER I'LL TRY SIR NOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO HOPE FOR THERE'S A GOOD DEAL TO HOPE FOR DESPAIR WON'T HELP YOU YOU MUST GO TO WORK
6696-68773-0012 FOR I'VE DISGRACED MYSELF IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND I CAN'T LEAVE HERE TILL SOMETHING IS KNOWN OF LUCY'S FATE BUT I'LL DO SOMETHING ANY KIND OF WORK IF I CAN GET IT I NEED SOMEONE TO ASSIST ME IN MY CORRESPONDENCE SAID KENNETH WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE MY SECRETARY
6696-68773-0013 ME MISTER FORBES ME YES TOM I'LL PAY YOU TWENTY DOLLARS A WEEK TO START WITH AND MORE IF YOU SERVE ME FAITHFULLY AND YOU'LL BOARD HERE OF COURSE THEN TOM GATES BROKE DOWN AND BEGAN TO CRY LIKE A CHILD ALTHOUGH HE TRIED HARD TO CONTROL HIMSELF
6696-68773-0014 JUST NOW YOU MUST HAVE SOME SLEEP AND GET YOUR STRENGTH BACK AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT LUCY BURKE WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE AND I AM CONFIDENT HE WILL BE ABLE TO TRACE THE GIRL IN TIME THANK YOU SIR
6696-68773-0015 THEN HE FOLLOWED THE BUTLER AWAY TO HIS ROOM AND AFTER THE GIRLS HAD DISCUSSED HIM AND EXPRESSED THEIR SYMPATHY FOR THE UNFORTUNATE FELLOW THEY ALL TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANT MATTER OF THE CAMPAIGN THE DEBATE WITH HOPKINS WAS THE THING THAT OCCUPIED THEM JUST NOW
6696-68773-0016 AND THEY MUST REPLY FORCIBLY TO THE MISLEADING STATEMENTS MADE IN HIS LAST HAND BILL MEANTIME TOM GATES WAS SUNK IN THE DEEP SLEEP OF PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION AND THE DAY WORE AWAY BEFORE HE WAKENED
6696-68773-0017 WHEN AT LAST HE REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS HE FOUND THE SUN SINKING IN THE WEST AND FEARED HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF INDISCRETION HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS MISTER FORBES'S SECRETARY NOW AND THAT MISTER FORBES MIGHT WANT HIM
6696-68773-0018 HE WAS NOT YET THOROUGHLY RESTED BUT NIGHT WAS APPROACHING AND HE REFLECTED THAT HE COULD OBTAIN ALL THE SLEEP THAT HE NEEDED THEN SO GREATLY REFRESHED AND IN A QUIETER MOOD THAN HE HAD BEEN FOR DAYS THE YOUNG MAN DRESSED AND ENTERED THE HALL TO FIND HIS WAY DOWNSTAIRS
6696-68773-0019 WHO A FEW PACES AWAY HAD HER BACK TO THE DOOR OF HER OWN CHAMBER FROM WHICH SHE HAD EVIDENTLY JUST STEPPED SHE STOOD MOTIONLESS LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT THE YOUTH WHO CONFRONTED HER LUCY DON'T YOU KNOW ME HE ASKED HIS VOICE TREMBLING WITH EMOTION

6696-68773-0022 IT'S VERY GRATIFYING I'M SURE YOUNG MAN SAID THE GIRL A TOUCH OF SCORN IN HER TONES IF YOU'RE MY OWN TOM YOU'LL PERHAPS STAND OUT OF MY WAY AND LET ME GO TO MY WORK WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE BACKED UP
6696-68773-0023 WHICH SHE DID WITH A GESTURE OF DISDAIN WHEN ELIZA PARSONS HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN THE BACK STAIRS BETH DREW A LONG BREATH AND APPROACHED TOM GATES WHO STILL STOOD BY THE WALL STARING AT THE PLACE WHERE THE GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED
6696-68773-0024 I OVERHEARD SAID BETH TELL ME TOM IS SHE REALLY LIKE LUCY HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A DAZED EXPRESSION AS IF HE SCARCELY COMPREHENDED HER WORDS COULD YOU HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN PERSISTED THE QUESTIONER
6696-68773-0025 HE PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS EYES AND GAVE A SHUDDER EITHER IT WAS LUCY OR HER GHOST HE MUTTERED ELIZA PARSONS IS NO GHOST DECLARED BETH SHE'S ONE OF THE MAIDS HERE AT ELMHURST AND YOU'RE QUITE LIKELY TO SEE HER AGAIN
6696-68773-0026 HAS SHE BEEN HERE LONG HE ASKED EAGERLY NO ONLY A FEW DAYS OH WHEN I FIRST SAW HER I WAS STRUCK BY HER RESEMBLANCE TO MISSUS ROGERS CONTINUED THE GIRL
6696-68773-0027 SAID TOM CHOKING BACK A SOB LUCY COULDN'T BE SO SO AIRY SO HEARTLESS SHE
