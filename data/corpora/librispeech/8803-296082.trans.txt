8803-296082-0010 BY THE ALMA RIVER OPEN YOUR ATLAS AT THE MAP OF RUSSIA LOOK DOWN TOWARD THE BOTTOM AT THAT PART OF THE GREAT EMPIRE WHICH BORDERS ON THE EUXINE OR BLACK SEA
8803-296082-0011 THERE YOU WILL FIND A SMALL PENINSULA IT IS REALLY ALMOST AN ISLAND BEING SURROUNDED ON THREE SIDES BY WATER LABELED CRIMEA IT IS ONLY A PART OF ONE OF THE SMALLEST OF RUSSIA'S FORTY ODD PROVINCES
8803-296082-0012 THE PROVINCE OF TAURIDA YET IT IS ONE OF THE FAMOUS PLACES OF HISTORY FOR HERE IN THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE WAS FOUGHT THE CRIMEAN WAR ONE OF THE GREATEST WARS OF MODERN TIMES
8803-296082-0013 RUSSIA AND TURKEY HAVE NEVER BEEN GOOD NEIGHBORS
8803-296082-0014 ALWAYS QUARRELING ABOUT THIS OR THAT THE FACT BEING THAT EACH IS AFRAID OF THE OTHER'S GETTING TOO MUCH LAND AND TOO MUCH POWER IN THESE DISPUTES THE OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE HAVE GENERALLY SYMPATHIZED WITH TURKEY
8803-296082-0015 FEELING THAT RUSSIA HAD QUITE ENOUGH POWER AND THAT IF SHE HAD MORE IT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS FOR ALL OF THEM SOME DAY YOU WILL READ IN HISTORY ABOUT THE EASTERN QUESTION AND THE BALANCE OF POWER
8803-296082-0016 AND WILL FIND OUT JUST WHAT THESE MEANT IN THE FIFTIES BUT THIS IS ALL THAT YOU NEED KNOW NOW IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR TURKEY FEELING THAT RUSSIA WAS PRESSING TOO HARD UPON HER
8803-296082-0017 CALLED UPON THE OTHER EUROPEAN POWERS TO HELP HER THE RESULT WAS THAT ENGLAND FRANCE SARDINIA NOW A PART OF ITALY BUT THEN A SEPARATE KINGDOM AND TURKEY MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND ALL TOGETHER
8803-296082-0018 DECLARED WAR UPON RUSSIA ENGLAND HAD BEEN AT PEACE WITH ALL THE WORLD FOR FORTY YEARS EVER SINCE THE WARS OF NAPOLEON WHICH WERE CLOSED BY THE GREAT VICTORY OF WATERLOO THE ENGLISH ARE A BRAVE RACE
8803-296082-0019 THEY HAD FORGOTTEN THE HORRORS OF WAR AND REMEMBERED ONLY ITS GLORIES AND ITS VICTORIES AND THEY SPRANG TO ARMS AS JOYOUSLY AS BOYS RUN TO A FOOTBALL GAME SHARPEN YOUR CUTLASSES AND THE DAY IS OURS SAID SIR CHARLES NAPIER TO HIS MEN
8803-296082-0020 JUST BEFORE THE BRITISH FLEET SAILED AND THIS WAS THE FEELING ALL THROUGH THE COUNTRY THE FLEETS OF THE ALLIED POWERS GATHERED IN THE BLACK SEA FORMING ONE GREAT ARMADA SURROUNDED THE PENINSULA OF THE CRIMEA AND LANDED THEIR ARMIES
8803-296082-0021 IN SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR WAS FOUGHT THE FIRST GREAT BATTLE BY THE ALMA RIVER THE ALLIES WERE VICTORIOUS AND A GREAT SHOUT OF JOY WENT UP ALL OVER ENGLAND VICTORY VICTORY CRIED OLD AND YOUNG
8803-296082-0022 THERE WERE BELLS AND BONFIRES AND ILLUMINATIONS THE WHOLE COUNTRY WENT MAD WITH JOY
8803-296082-0023 NO ONE THOUGHT OF ANYTHING EXCEPT GLORY WAVING BANNERS AND SOUNDING TRUMPETS BUT BANNERS AND TRUMPETS THOUGH A REAL PART OF WAR ARE ONLY A VERY SMALL PART AFTER A LITTLE TIME THROUGH THE SHOUTING AND REJOICING
8803-296082-0024 A DIFFERENT SOUND WAS HEARD THE SOUND OF WEEPING AND LAMENTATION NOT ONLY FOR THE HUNDREDS OF BRAVE MEN WHO WERE LYING DEAD BESIDE THE FATAL RIVER BUT FOR THE OTHER HUNDREDS OF SICK AND WOUNDED SOLDIERS DYING FOR WANT OF CARE
8803-296082-0025 THERE HAD BEEN GROSS NEGLECT AND TERRIBLE MISMANAGEMENT IN THE CARRYING ON OF THE WAR NOBODY KNEW JUST WHOSE FAULT IT WAS BUT EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE LACKING THAT WAS MOST NEEDED ON THAT DESOLATE SHORE OF THE CRIMEA
8803-296082-0026 THE ENGLISH TROOPS WERE IN AN ENEMY'S COUNTRY AND A POOR COUNTRY AT THAT WHATEVER SUPPLIES THERE WERE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE RUSSIAN ARMIES FOR THEIR OWN NEEDS FOOD AND CLOTHING HAD BEEN SENT OUT FROM ENGLAND IN GREAT QUANTITIES
8803-296082-0027 BUT SOMEHOW NO ONE COULD FIND THEM SOME SUPPLIES HAD BEEN STOWED IN THE HOLD OF VESSELS AND OTHER THINGS PILED ON TOP SO THAT THEY COULD NOT BE GOT AT SOME WERE STORED IN WAREHOUSES WHICH NO ONE HAD AUTHORITY TO OPEN
8803-296082-0028 SOME WERE ACTUALLY ROTTING AT THE WHARVES FOR WANT OF PRECISE ORDERS AS TO THEIR DISPOSAL THE SURGEONS HAD NO BANDAGES THE DOCTORS NO MEDICINES IT WAS A STATE OF THINGS THAT TO DAY WE CAN HARDLY IMAGINE INDEED
8803-296082-0029 IT SEEMED AS IF THE NEED WERE SO GREAT AND TERRIBLE THAT IT PARALYZED THOSE WHO SAW IT IT IS NOW POURING RAIN WROTE WILLIAM HOWARD RUSSELL TO THE LONDON TIMES
8803-296082-0030 THE WIND IS HOWLING OVER THE STAGGERING TENTS THE TRENCHES ARE TURNED INTO DYKES IN THE TENTS THE WATER IS SOMETIMES A FOOT DEEP OUR MEN HAVE NOT EITHER WARM OR WATERPROOF CLOTHING THEY ARE OUT FOR TWELVE HOURS AT A TIME IN THE TRENCHES
8803-296082-0031 THEY ARE PLUNGED INTO THE INEVITABLE MISERIES OF A WINTER CAMPAIGN AND NOT A SOUL SEEMS TO CARE FOR THEIR COMFORT OR EVEN FOR THEIR LIVES THESE ARE HARD TRUTHS BUT THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND MUST HEAR THEM
8803-296082-0032 THEY MUST KNOW THAT THE WRETCHED BEGGAR WHO WANDERS ABOUT THE STREETS OF LONDON IN THE RAIN LEADS THE LIFE OF A PRINCE COMPARED WITH THE BRITISH SOLDIERS WHO ARE FIGHTING OUT HERE FOR THEIR COUNTRY THE COMMONEST ACCESSORIES OF A HOSPITAL ARE WANTING
8803-296082-0033 THERE IS NOT THE LEAST ATTENTION PAID TO DECENCY OR CLEAN LINEN THE STENCH IS APPALLING THE FETID AIR CAN HARDLY STRUGGLE OUT TO TAINT THE ATMOSPHERE SAVE THROUGH THE CHINKS IN THE WALLS AND ROOFS AND FOR ALL I CAN OBSERVE
8803-296082-0034 THESE MEN DIE WITHOUT THE LEAST EFFORT BEING MADE TO SAVE THEM THERE THEY LIE JUST AS THEY WERE LET GENTLY DOWN ON THE GROUND BY THE POOR FELLOWS THEIR COMRADES WHO BROUGHT THEM ON THEIR BACKS FROM THE CAMP WITH THE GREATEST TENDERNESS
8803-296082-0035 BUT WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO REMAIN WITH THEM THE SICK APPEAR TO BE TENDED BY THE SICK AND THE DYING BY THE DYING HE ADDED THAT THE SNOW WAS THREE FEET DEEP ON A LEVEL
8803-296082-0036 AND THE COLD SO INTENSE THAT MANY SOLDIERS WERE FROZEN IN THEIR TENTS NO ONE MEANT TO BE CRUEL OR NEGLECTFUL BUT THERE WERE NOT HALF ENOUGH DOCTORS AND THINK OF IT CHILDREN THERE WERE NO NURSES HOW DID THIS HAPPEN
8803-296082-0037 WELL WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES DID NOT WANT FEMALE NURSES THE MATTER WAS TALKED OVER AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT THINGS WOULD GO BETTER WITHOUT THEM THIS WAS PUT ON THE GROUND THAT THE CLASS OF NURSES AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
8803-296082-0038 WAS AT THAT TIME IN ENGLAND A VERY POOR ONE THEY WERE OFTEN DRUNKEN GENERALLY UNFEELING AND ALWAYS IGNORANT THE WAR DEPARTMENT DECIDED THAT THIS KIND OF NURSE WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD THEY DID NOT REALIZE THAT
8803-296082-0039 THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH YIELDING PLACE TO NEW AND THAT THE TIME WAS COME WHEN THE NEW NURSE MUST REPLACE THE OLD BUT NOW THE NEED WAS COME IMMEDIATE AND TERRIBLE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO MEET IT WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND REALIZED THIS
8803-296082-0040 WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT THE HOSPITAL AT SCUTARI WAS FILLED WITH SICK AND WOUNDED AND DYING MEN AND NO ONE TO CARE FOR THEM SAVE A FEW MALE ORDERLIES WHOLLY UNTRAINED FOR THE TASK WHEN THEY HEARD THAT IN THE HOSPITALS OF THE FRENCH ARMY THE SISTERS OF MERCY WERE DOING THEIR BLESSED WORK TENDING THE WOUNDED
8803-296082-0041 HEALING THE SICK AND COMFORTING THE DYING AND REALIZED THAT THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS THEIR OWN SONS BROTHERS AND HUSBANDS HAD NO SUCH HELP AND NO SUCH COMFORT THE SOUND OF BELL AND TRUMPET WAS LOST IN A GREAT CRY OF ANGER AND SORROW
8803-296082-0042 THAT WENT UP FROM THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND MATTERS GREW WORSE AND WORSE AS ONE GREAT BATTLE AFTER ANOTHER SENT ITS DREADFUL FRUITS TO THE ALREADY OVERFLOWING HOSPITAL AT SCUTARI ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIFTH CAME BALAKLAVA
8803-296082-0043 YET I ASK YOU TO READ IT AGAIN HERE SO THAT IT MAY FIT INTO ITS PLACE IN THE STORY OF THIS TERRIBLE WAR REMEMBER IT IS ONLY ONE INCIDENT OF THAT GREAT BATTLE OF BALAKLAVA IN WHICH BOTH SIDES CLAIMED THE VICTORY
8803-296082-0044 WHILE NEITHER GAINED ANY SIGNAL ADVANTAGE
8803-296082-0045 ALL IN THE VALLEY OF DEATH RODE THE SIX HUNDRED FORWARD THE LIGHT BRIGADE CHARGE FOR THE GUNS HE SAID INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH RODE THE SIX HUNDRED FORWARD THE LIGHT BRIGADE
8803-296082-0046 WAS THERE A MAN DISMAYED NOT THOUGH THE SOLDIER KNEW SOMEONE HAD BLUNDERED THEIRS NOT TO MAKE REPLY THEIRS NOT TO REASON WHY THEIRS BUT TO DO AND DIE INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH RODE THE SIX HUNDRED
8803-296082-0047 CANNON TO RIGHT OF THEM CANNON TO LEFT OF THEM CANNON IN FRONT OF THEM VOLLEYED AND THUNDERED STORMED AT WITH SHOT AND SHELL BOLDLY THEY RODE AND WELL INTO THE JAWS OF DEATH
8803-296082-0048 INTO THE MOUTH OF HELL RODE THE SIX HUNDRED FLASHED ALL THEIR SABRES BARE FLASHED AS THEY TURNED IN AIR SABRING THE GUNNERS THERE CHARGING AN ARMY WHILE ALL THE WORLD WONDERED
8803-296082-0049 PLUNGED IN THE BATTERY SMOKE RIGHT THROUGH THE LINE THEY BROKE COSSACK AND RUSSIAN REELED FROM THE SABRE STROKE SHATTERED AND SUNDERED THEN THEY RODE BACK BUT NOT NOT THE SIX HUNDRED
8803-296082-0050 CANNON TO RIGHT OF THEM CANNON TO LEFT OF THEM CANNON BEHIND THEM VOLLEYED AND THUNDERED STORMED AT WITH SHOT AND SHELL WHILE HORSE AND HERO FELL THEY THAT HAD FOUGHT SO WELL
8803-296082-0051 CAME THROUGH THE JAWS OF DEATH BACK FROM THE MOUTH OF HELL ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THEM LEFT OF SIX HUNDRED WHEN CAN THEIR GLORY FADE O THE WILD CHARGE THEY MADE ALL THE WORLD WONDERED
8803-296082-0052 HONOR THE CHARGE THEY MADE HONOR THE LIGHT BRIGADE NOBLE SIX HUNDRED I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF WILLIAM HOWARD RUSSELL
8803-296082-0053 HE WAS THE WAR CORRESPONDENT OF THE TIMES THE GREAT ENGLISH NEWSPAPER AND A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE HEART AND FEELING HE WAS ON THE SPOT AND SAW THE HORRORS OF THE WAR AT FIRST HAND HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH SORROW AND PITY FOR THE SUFFERING AROUND HIM
8803-296082-0054 AND HE WROTE DAY AFTER DAY HOME TO ENGLAND TELLING WHAT HE SAW AND WHAT WAS NEEDED SOON AFTER BALAKLAVA HE WROTE ARE THERE NO DEVOTED WOMEN AMONGST US
8803-296082-0055 ABLE AND WILLING TO GO FORTH TO MINISTER TO THE SICK AND SUFFERING SOLDIERS OF THE EAST IN THE HOSPITALS AT SCUTARI ARE THERE NONE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ENGLAND AT THIS EXTREME HOUR OF NEED READY FOR SUCH A WORK OF MERCY
8803-296082-0056 FRANCE HAS SENT FORTH HER SISTERS OF MERCY UNSPARINGLY AND THEY ARE EVEN NOW BY THE BEDSIDES OF THE WOUNDED AND THE DYING GIVING WHAT WOMAN'S HAND ALONE CAN GIVE OF COMFORT AND RELIEF
8803-296082-0057 MUST WE FALL SO FAR BELOW THE FRENCH IN SELF SACRIFICE AND DEVOTEDNESS IN A WORK WHICH CHRIST SO SIGNALLY BLESSES AS DONE UNTO HIMSELF I WAS SICK AND YE VISITED ME
8803-296082-0058 THIS WAS THE TRUMPET CALL THAT RANG IN THE EARS OF THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND SOUNDING A CLEARER NOTE THAN ALL THE CLARIONS OF VICTORY
