3925-57460-0005 IS HUNG ALONG THE WALLS THE BIG BELL OUTSIDE THE MAIN HALL IS RATHER REMARKABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT BEAUTY OF THE DEEP BASS WAVES OF SOUND WHICH IT ROLLS THROUGH THE CITY THAN ON ACCOUNT OF ITS SIZE
3925-57460-0006 FOR IT IS TEN FEET HIGH AND FIVE FEET EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER WHILE ITS METAL IS A FOOT THICK IT WAS HUNG UP IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE BUT THE CHIEF OBJECTS OF INTEREST IN THESE BEAUTIFUL GROUNDS ARE THE CHAPELS ATTACHED TO THE TOMBS OF THE SHOGUNS

3925-57460-0008 SEEING THAT THE ABBOT WAS NO ORDINARY MAN STOPPED AND ASKED HIS NAME AND ENTERED THE TEMPLE TO REST HIMSELF THE SMOOTH SPOKEN MONK SOON FOUND SUCH FAVOUR WITH IYEYASU
3925-57460-0009 AND SEEING THAT ITS GROUNDS WERE NARROW AND INCONVENIENTLY NEAR THE CASTLE HE CAUSED IT TO BE REMOVED TO ITS PRESENT SITE IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN TEN THE TEMPLE WAS RAISED
3925-57460-0010 TO THE DIGNITY OF THE IMPERIAL TEMPLES WHICH UNTIL THE LAST REVOLUTION WERE PRESIDED OVER BY PRINCES OF THE BLOOD AND TO THE ABBOT WAS GRANTED THE RIGHT ON GOING TO THE CASTLE OF SITTING IN HIS LITTER AS FAR AS THE ENTRANCE HALL
3925-57460-0011 INSTEAD OF DISMOUNTING AT THE USUAL PLACE AND PROCEEDING ON FOOT THROUGH SEVERAL GATES AND COURTYARDS NOR WERE THE PRIVILEGES OF THE TEMPLE CONFINED TO BARREN HONOURS
3925-57460-0012 WHEN IYEYASU DIED THE SHRINE CALLED ANTOKU IN WAS ERECTED IN HIS HONOUR TO THE SOUTH OF THE MAIN TEMPLE HERE ON THE SEVENTEENTH DAY OF THE FOURTH MONTH THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH CEREMONIES ARE HELD IN HONOUR OF HIS SPIRIT

3925-57460-0018 WHO LIES WITH HIS GRANDFATHER AT NIKKO
3925-57460-0019 LYING ON ONE SIDE OF A SPLENDID AVENUE OF SCOTCH FIRS WHICH BORDER A BROAD WELL KEPT GRAVEL WALK PASSING THROUGH A SMALL GATEWAY OF RARE DESIGN
3925-57460-0020 LINED WITH A LONG ARRAY OF COLOSSAL STONE LANTERNS THE GIFT OF THE VASSALS OF THE DEPARTED PRINCE A SECOND GATEWAY

3925-57460-0025 AT THE TOP OF WHICH PROTECTED BY A BRONZE DOOR STANDS A SIMPLE MONUMENTAL URN OF BRONZE ON A STONE PEDESTAL UNDER THIS IS THE GRAVE ITSELF AND IT HAS ALWAYS STRUCK ME THAT THERE IS NO SMALL AMOUNT OF POETICAL FEELING IN THIS SIMPLE ENDING TO SO MUCH MAGNIFICENCE
3925-57460-0026 THE SERMON MAY HAVE BEEN PREACHED BY DESIGN OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN BY ACCIDENT BUT THE LESSON IS THERE THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE SHRINES ALL OF WHICH ARE DECORATED IN THE SAME MANNER IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO JUSTICE TO THEIR BEAUTY IN WORDS
3925-57460-0027 WRITING MANY THOUSAND MILES AWAY FROM THEM I HAVE THE MEMORY BEFORE ME OF A PLACE GREEN IN WINTER PLEASANT AND COOL IN THE HOTTEST SUMMER OF PEACEFUL CLOISTERS OF THE FRAGRANCE OF INCENSE OF THE SUBDUED CHANT OF RICHLY ROBED PRIESTS
3925-57460-0028 AND THE MUSIC OF BELLS OF EXQUISITE DESIGNS HARMONIOUS COLOURING RICH GILDING
