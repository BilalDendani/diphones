8414-284674-0008 AND WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE BLEACHERS AND THE STUNTS BEGAN HE FORGOT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THE EXCITING EVENTS BEFORE HIS EYES HENRY HAD NO PENCIL BUT HE HAD AN EXCELLENT MEMORY
8414-284674-0009 HE REPEATED OVER AND OVER THE NAME OF EACH WINNER AS IT APPEARED ON THE HUGE SIGNBOARD IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE FREE FOR ALL RUNNING RACE WAS ANNOUNCED WHAT DO THEY MEAN FREE FOR ALL ASKED HENRY OF A SMALL BOY AT HIS SIDE
8414-284674-0010 WHY JUST ANYBODY EXPLAINED THE BOY CURIOUSLY DIDN'T YOU EVER SEE ONE DIDN'T YOU SEE THE ONE LAST YEAR NO SAID HENRY THE BOY LAUGHED THAT WAS A FUNNY ONE HE SAID THERE WAS A COLLEGE RUNNER IN IT AND A COUPLE OF FAT MEN AND SOME GIRLS LOTS OF PEOPLE

8414-284674-0017 BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH HE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND THIS GREATLY IT'S FUN TO RUN ANYHOW HE THOUGHT IT WAS FUN CERTAINLY HE FELT AS IF HIS LIMBS WERE STRUNG TOGETHER ON SPRINGS
