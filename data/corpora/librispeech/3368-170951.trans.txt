3368-170951-0000 SHALL WE BEGIN EDUCATION WITH MUSIC AND GO ON TO GYMNASTIC AFTERWARDS BY ALL MEANS AND WHEN YOU SPEAK OF MUSIC DO YOU INCLUDE LITERATURE OR NOT I DO AND LITERATURE MAY BE EITHER TRUE OR FALSE YES
3368-170951-0001 AND THE YOUNG SHOULD BE TRAINED IN BOTH KINDS AND WE BEGIN WITH THE FALSE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR MEANING HE SAID YOU KNOW I SAID THAT WE BEGIN BY TELLING CHILDREN STORIES WHICH THOUGH NOT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF TRUTH ARE IN THE MAIN FICTITIOUS
3368-170951-0002 VERY TRUE THAT WAS MY MEANING WHEN I SAID THAT WE MUST TEACH MUSIC BEFORE GYMNASTICS QUITE RIGHT HE SAID YOU KNOW ALSO THAT THE BEGINNING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY WORK
3368-170951-0003 QUITE TRUE AND SHALL WE JUST CARELESSLY ALLOW CHILDREN TO HEAR ANY CASUAL TALES WHICH MAY BE DEVISED BY CASUAL PERSONS
3368-170951-0004 BUT MOST OF THOSE WHICH ARE NOW IN USE MUST BE DISCARDED
3368-170951-0005 YOU MAY FIND A MODEL OF THE LESSER IN THE GREATER I SAID FOR THEY ARE NECESSARILY OF THE SAME TYPE AND THERE IS THE SAME SPIRIT IN BOTH OF THEM VERY LIKELY HE REPLIED BUT I DO NOT AS YET KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD TERM THE GREATER THOSE I SAID WHICH ARE NARRATED BY HOMER AND HESIOD
3368-170951-0006 A FAULT WHICH IS MOST SERIOUS I SAID THE FAULT OF TELLING A LIE AND WHAT IS MORE A BAD LIE BUT WHEN IS THIS FAULT COMMITTED WHENEVER AN ERRONEOUS REPRESENTATION IS MADE OF THE NATURE OF GODS AND HEROES
3368-170951-0007 AS WHEN A PAINTER PAINTS A PORTRAIT NOT HAVING THE SHADOW OF A LIKENESS TO THE ORIGINAL YES HE SAID THAT SORT OF THING IS CERTAINLY VERY BLAMEABLE BUT WHAT ARE THE STORIES WHICH YOU MEAN FIRST OF ALL I SAID
3368-170951-0008 EVEN IF THEY WERE TRUE OUGHT CERTAINLY NOT TO BE LIGHTLY TOLD TO YOUNG AND THOUGHTLESS PERSONS IF POSSIBLE THEY HAD BETTER BE BURIED IN SILENCE BUT IF THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR THEIR MENTION A CHOSEN FEW MIGHT HEAR THEM IN A MYSTERY
3368-170951-0009 AND THEY SHOULD SACRIFICE NOT A COMMON ELEUSINIAN PIG BUT SOME HUGE AND UNPROCURABLE VICTIM AND THEN THE NUMBER OF THE HEARERS WILL BE VERY FEW INDEED
3368-170951-0010 YES ADEIMANTUS THEY ARE STORIES NOT TO BE REPEATED IN OUR STATE
3368-170951-0011 AND THAT EVEN IF HE CHASTISES HIS FATHER WHEN HE DOES WRONG IN WHATEVER MANNER HE WILL ONLY BE FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF THE FIRST AND GREATEST AMONG THE GODS I ENTIRELY AGREE WITH YOU HE SAID IN MY OPINION THOSE STORIES ARE QUITE UNFIT TO BE REPEATED
3368-170951-0012 AND OF THE PLOTS AND FIGHTINGS OF THE GODS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER FOR THEY ARE NOT TRUE NO WE SHALL NEVER MENTION THE BATTLES OF THE GIANTS OR LET THEM BE EMBROIDERED ON GARMENTS AND WE SHALL BE SILENT ABOUT THE INNUMERABLE OTHER QUARRELS OF GODS AND HEROES WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES
3368-170951-0013 IF THEY WOULD ONLY BELIEVE US WE WOULD TELL THEM THAT QUARRELLING IS UNHOLY AND THAT NEVER UP TO THIS TIME HAS THERE BEEN ANY QUARREL BETWEEN CITIZENS
3368-170951-0014 OR HOW ON ANOTHER OCCASION ZEUS SENT HIM FLYING FOR TAKING HER PART WHEN SHE WAS BEING BEATEN AND ALL THE BATTLES OF THE GODS IN HOMER THESE TALES MUST NOT BE ADMITTED INTO OUR STATE WHETHER THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN ALLEGORICAL MEANING OR NOT
3368-170951-0015 THERE YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED BUT IF ANY ONE ASKS WHERE ARE SUCH MODELS TO BE FOUND AND OF WHAT TALES ARE YOU SPEAKING HOW SHALL WE ANSWER HIM I SAID TO HIM YOU AND I ADEIMANTUS AT THIS MOMENT ARE NOT POETS BUT FOUNDERS OF A STATE
3368-170951-0016 NOW THE FOUNDERS OF A STATE OUGHT TO KNOW THE GENERAL FORMS IN WHICH POETS SHOULD CAST THEIR TALES AND THE LIMITS WHICH MUST BE OBSERVED BY THEM BUT TO MAKE THE TALES IS NOT THEIR BUSINESS VERY TRUE HE SAID BUT WHAT ARE THESE FORMS OF THEOLOGY WHICH YOU MEAN SOMETHING OF THIS KIND I REPLIED
3368-170951-0017 GOD IS ALWAYS TO BE REPRESENTED AS HE TRULY IS WHATEVER BE THE SORT OF POETRY EPIC LYRIC OR TRAGIC IN WHICH THE REPRESENTATION IS GIVEN RIGHT AND IS HE NOT TRULY GOOD AND MUST HE NOT BE REPRESENTED AS SUCH CERTAINLY
3368-170951-0018 AND NO GOOD THING IS HURTFUL NO INDEED AND THAT WHICH IS NOT HURTFUL HURTS NOT CERTAINLY NOT AND THAT WHICH HURTS NOT DOES NO EVIL NO AND CAN THAT WHICH DOES NO EVIL BE A CAUSE OF EVIL IMPOSSIBLE AND THE GOOD IS ADVANTAGEOUS YES
3368-170951-0019 AND THEREFORE THE CAUSE OF WELL BEING YES IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE GOOD IS NOT THE CAUSE OF ALL THINGS BUT OF THE GOOD ONLY ASSUREDLY THEN GOD IF HE BE GOOD IS NOT THE AUTHOR OF ALL THINGS AS THE MANY ASSERT BUT HE IS THE CAUSE OF
3368-170951-0020 AND NOT OF MOST THINGS THAT OCCUR TO MEN FOR FEW ARE THE GOODS OF HUMAN LIFE AND MANY ARE THE EVILS AND THE GOOD IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO GOD ALONE OF THE EVILS THE CAUSES ARE TO BE SOUGHT ELSEWHERE AND NOT IN HIM THAT APPEARS TO ME TO BE MOST TRUE HE SAID
3368-170951-0021 THEN WE MUST NOT LISTEN TO HOMER OR TO ANY OTHER POET WHO IS GUILTY OF THE FOLLY OF SAYING THAT TWO CASKS LIE AT THE THRESHOLD OF ZEUS FULL OF LOTS ONE OF GOOD THE OTHER OF EVIL LOTS
3368-170951-0022 SOMETIMES MEETS WITH EVIL FORTUNE AT OTHER TIMES WITH GOOD BUT THAT HE TO WHOM IS GIVEN THE CUP OF UNMINGLED ILL HIM WILD HUNGER DRIVES O'ER THE BEAUTEOUS EARTH AND AGAIN ZEUS WHO IS THE DISPENSER OF GOOD AND EVIL TO US
3368-170951-0023 AND IF ANY ONE ASSERTS THAT THE VIOLATION OF OATHS AND TREATIES WHICH WAS REALLY THE WORK OF PANDARUS WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY ATHENE AND ZEUS
3368-170951-0024 GOD PLANTS GUILT AMONG MEN WHEN HE DESIRES UTTERLY TO DESTROY A HOUSE
3368-170951-0025 BUT THAT THOSE WHO ARE PUNISHED ARE MISERABLE AND THAT GOD IS THE AUTHOR OF THEIR MISERY THE POET IS NOT TO BE PERMITTED TO SAY THOUGH HE MAY SAY THAT THE WICKED ARE MISERABLE BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE TO BE PUNISHED AND ARE BENEFITED BY RECEIVING PUNISHMENT FROM GOD
3368-170951-0026 BUT THAT GOD BEING GOOD IS THE AUTHOR OF EVIL TO ANY ONE IS TO BE STRENUOUSLY DENIED AND NOT TO BE SAID OR SUNG OR HEARD IN VERSE OR PROSE BY ANY ONE WHETHER OLD OR YOUNG IN ANY WELL ORDERED COMMONWEALTH SUCH A FICTION IS SUICIDAL RUINOUS
3368-170951-0027 IMPIOUS I AGREE WITH YOU HE REPLIED AND AM READY TO GIVE MY ASSENT TO THE LAW LET THIS THEN BE ONE OF OUR RULES AND PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE GODS TO WHICH OUR POETS AND RECITERS WILL BE EXPECTED TO CONFORM THAT GOD IS NOT THE AUTHOR OF ALL THINGS
3368-170951-0028 AND THINGS WHICH ARE AT THEIR BEST ARE ALSO LEAST LIABLE TO BE ALTERED OR DISCOMPOSED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN HEALTHIEST AND STRONGEST THE HUMAN FRAME IS LEAST LIABLE TO BE AFFECTED BY MEATS AND DRINKS
3368-170951-0029 AND THE PLANT WHICH IS IN THE FULLEST VIGOUR ALSO SUFFERS LEAST FROM WINDS OR THE HEAT OF THE SUN OR ANY SIMILAR CAUSES OF COURSE AND WILL NOT THE BRAVEST AND WISEST SOUL BE LEAST CONFUSED OR DERANGED BY ANY EXTERNAL INFLUENCE TRUE
3368-170951-0030 IS LEAST LIABLE TO SUFFER CHANGE FROM WITHOUT TRUE BUT SURELY GOD AND THE THINGS OF GOD ARE IN EVERY WAY PERFECT OF COURSE THEY ARE THEN HE CAN HARDLY BE COMPELLED BY EXTERNAL INFLUENCE TO TAKE MANY SHAPES HE CANNOT
3368-170951-0031 FOR WE CANNOT SUPPOSE HIM TO BE DEFICIENT EITHER IN VIRTUE OR BEAUTY VERY TRUE ADEIMANTUS BUT THEN WOULD ANY ONE WHETHER GOD OR MAN DESIRE TO MAKE HIMSELF WORSE IMPOSSIBLE
3368-170951-0032 THEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT GOD SHOULD EVER BE WILLING TO CHANGE BEING AS IS SUPPOSED THE FAIREST AND BEST THAT IS CONCEIVABLE EVERY GOD REMAINS ABSOLUTELY AND FOR EVER IN HIS OWN FORM THAT NECESSARILY FOLLOWS HE SAID IN MY JUDGMENT
3368-170951-0033 WALK UP AND DOWN CITIES IN ALL SORTS OF FORMS AND LET NO ONE SLANDER PROTEUS AND THETIS
3368-170951-0034 FOR THE LIFE GIVING DAUGHTERS OF INACHUS THE RIVER OF ARGOS LET US HAVE NO MORE LIES OF THAT SORT NEITHER MUST WE HAVE MOTHERS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE POETS SCARING THEIR CHILDREN WITH A BAD VERSION OF THESE MYTHS TELLING HOW CERTAIN GODS AS THEY SAY
3368-170951-0035 BUT LET THEM TAKE HEED LEST THEY MAKE COWARDS OF THEIR CHILDREN AND AT THE SAME TIME SPEAK BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE GODS HEAVEN FORBID HE SAID
3368-170951-0036 IS HATED OF GODS AND MEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID I MEAN THAT NO ONE IS WILLINGLY DECEIVED IN THAT WHICH IS THE TRUEST AND HIGHEST PART OF HIMSELF OR ABOUT THE TRUEST AND HIGHEST MATTERS THERE ABOVE ALL
3368-170951-0037 HE IS MOST AFRAID OF A LIE HAVING POSSESSION OF HIM STILL HE SAID I DO NOT COMPREHEND YOU THE REASON IS I REPLIED THAT YOU ATTRIBUTE SOME PROFOUND MEANING TO MY WORDS
3368-170951-0038 THERE IS NOTHING MORE HATEFUL TO THEM AND AS I WAS JUST NOW REMARKING THIS IGNORANCE IN THE SOUL OF HIM WHO IS DECEIVED MAY BE CALLED THE TRUE LIE FOR THE LIE IN WORDS IS ONLY A KIND OF IMITATION AND SHADOWY IMAGE OF A PREVIOUS AFFECTION OF THE SOUL
3368-170951-0039 NOT PURE UNADULTERATED FALSEHOOD AM I NOT RIGHT PERFECTLY RIGHT THE TRUE LIE IS HATED NOT ONLY BY THE GODS BUT ALSO BY MEN YES WHEREAS THE LIE IN WORDS IS IN CERTAIN CASES USEFUL AND NOT HATEFUL
3368-170951-0040 IN DEALING WITH ENEMIES THAT WOULD BE AN INSTANCE OR AGAIN WHEN THOSE WHOM WE CALL OUR FRIENDS IN A FIT OF MADNESS OR ILLUSION ARE GOING TO DO SOME HARM THEN IT IS USEFUL AND IS A SORT OF MEDICINE OR PREVENTIVE ALSO IN THE TALES OF MYTHOLOGY OF WHICH WE WERE JUST NOW SPEAKING
3368-170951-0041 AND THEREFORE HAS RECOURSE TO INVENTION THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS HE SAID THEN THE LYING POET HAS NO PLACE IN OUR IDEA OF GOD I SHOULD SAY NOT OR PERHAPS HE MAY TELL A LIE BECAUSE HE IS AFRAID OF ENEMIES THAT IS INCONCEIVABLE
3368-170951-0042 THEN THE SUPERHUMAN AND DIVINE IS ABSOLUTELY INCAPABLE OF FALSEHOOD YES THEN IS GOD PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND TRUE BOTH IN WORD AND DEED HE CHANGES NOT HE DECEIVES NOT EITHER BY SIGN OR WORD BY DREAM OR WAKING VISION
3368-170951-0043 YOUR THOUGHTS HE SAID ARE THE REFLECTION OF MY OWN YOU AGREE WITH ME THEN I SAID THAT THIS IS THE SECOND TYPE OR FORM IN WHICH WE SHOULD WRITE AND SPEAK ABOUT DIVINE THINGS THE GODS ARE NOT MAGICIANS WHO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES
3368-170951-0044 NEITHER DO THEY DECEIVE MANKIND IN ANY WAY I GRANT THAT THEN ALTHOUGH WE ARE ADMIRERS OF HOMER WE DO NOT ADMIRE THE LYING DREAM WHICH ZEUS SENDS TO AGAMEMNON
3368-170951-0045 THETIS SAYS THAT APOLLO AT HER NUPTIALS WAS CELEBRATING IN SONG HER FAIR PROGENY WHOSE DAYS WERE TO BE LONG AND TO KNOW NO SICKNESS AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN OF MY LOT AS IN ALL THINGS BLESSED OF HEAVEN HE RAISED A NOTE OF TRIUMPH AND CHEERED MY SOUL
3368-170951-0046 AND I THOUGHT THAT THE WORD OF PHOEBUS BEING DIVINE AND FULL OF PROPHECY WOULD NOT FAIL AND NOW HE HIMSELF WHO UTTERED THE STRAIN
3368-170951-0047 HE IT IS WHO HAS SLAIN MY SON THESE ARE THE KIND OF SENTIMENTS ABOUT THE GODS WHICH WILL AROUSE OUR ANGER AND HE WHO UTTERS THEM SHALL BE REFUSED A CHORUS NEITHER SHALL WE ALLOW TEACHERS TO MAKE USE OF THEM IN THE INSTRUCTION OF THE YOUNG MEANING
3368-170951-0048 AS WE DO THAT OUR GUARDIANS AS FAR AS MEN CAN BE SHOULD BE TRUE WORSHIPPERS OF THE GODS AND LIKE THEM
