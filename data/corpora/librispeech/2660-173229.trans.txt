2660-173229-0018 DOES MISTER ARMADALE THINK ME MIXED UP IN THIS MATTER SHE WAS VIOLENTLY AGITATED TEARS IN HER EYES SIR OF THE SORT WHICH MY LEGAL EXPERIENCE HAS NOT ACCUSTOMED ME TO SEE I QUITE FORGOT MYSELF I ACTUALLY GAVE HER MY ARM
2660-173229-0019 AND LED HER AWAY GENTLY AMONG THE TREES A NICE POSITION TO FIND ME IN IF ANY OF THE SCANDAL MONGERS OF THE TOWN HAD HAPPENED TO BE WALKING IN THAT DIRECTION MY DEAR MISS MILROY SAYS I
2660-173229-0020 WHY SHOULD MISTER ARMADALE THINK YOU MIXED UP IN IT
2660-173229-0021 EXCLAIMED ALLAN INDIGNANTLY WHY DID YOU LEAVE HER A MOMENT IN DOUBT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I AM A LAWYER MISTER ARMADALE REJOINED PEDGIFT SENIOR DRYLY EVEN IN MOMENTS OF SENTIMENT UNDER CONVENIENT TREES WITH A PRETTY GIRL ON MY ARM
2660-173229-0022 I SET THINGS RIGHT IN DUE COURSE OF TIME
2660-173229-0023 NO SUCH IDEA HAD EVER ENTERED YOUR HEAD DID SHE SEEM RELIEVED ASKED ALLAN
2660-173229-0024 AND TO PLEDGE ME TO INVIOLABLE SECRECY ON THE SUBJECT OF OUR INTERVIEW SHE WAS PARTICULARLY DESIROUS THAT YOU SHOULD HEAR NOTHING ABOUT IT IF YOU ARE AT ALL ANXIOUS ON YOUR SIDE TO KNOW WHY I AM NOW BETRAYING HER CONFIDENCE
2660-173229-0025 I BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT HER CONFIDENCE RELATED TO NO LESS A PERSON THAN THE LADY WHO FAVORED YOU WITH A CALL JUST NOW MISS GWILT ALLAN WHO HAD BEEN ONCE MORE RESTLESSLY PACING THE ROOM STOPPED AND RETURNED TO HIS CHAIR
2660-173229-0026 IS THIS SERIOUS HE ASKED MOST SERIOUS SIR RETURNED PEDGIFT SENIOR I AM BETRAYING MISS NEELIE'S SECRET IN MISS NEELIE'S OWN INTEREST LET US GO BACK TO THAT CAUTIOUS QUESTION I PUT TO HER
2660-173229-0027 SHE FOUND SOME LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN ANSWERING IT FOR THE REPLY INVOLVED HER IN A NARRATIVE OF THE PARTING INTERVIEW BETWEEN HER GOVERNESS AND HERSELF THIS IS THE SUBSTANCE OF IT
2660-173229-0028 AND THE WORDS SHE USED AS REPORTED TO ME BY MISS NEELIE WERE THESE SHE SAID YOUR MOTHER HAS DECLINED TO ALLOW ME TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER DO YOU DECLINE TOO MISS NEELIE'S ANSWER WAS A REMARKABLY SENSIBLE ONE FOR A GIRL OF HER AGE
2660-173229-0029 AND I BELIEVE WE ARE EQUALLY GLAD TO PART WITH EACH OTHER BUT I HAVE NO WISH TO DECLINE TAKING LEAVE OF YOU SAYING THAT SHE HELD OUT HER HAND MISS GWILT STOOD LOOKING AT HER STEADILY WITHOUT TAKING IT
2660-173229-0030 AND ADDRESSED HER IN THESE WORDS YOU
2660-173229-0031 CONSCIOUS OF HAVING HER OWN MERCENARY DESIGNS ON YOU SHOULD ATTRIBUTE SIMILAR DESIGNS TO A YOUNG LADY WHO HAPPENS TO BE YOUR NEAR NEIGHBOR
2660-173229-0032 MISS NEELIE BY HER OWN CONFESSION AND QUITE NATURALLY I THINK WAS EXCESSIVELY INDIGNANT
2660-173229-0033 YOU SHAMELESS CREATURE HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT TO ME MISS GWILT'S REJOINDER WAS RATHER A REMARKABLE ONE
2660-173229-0034 WITHOUT SOONER OR LATER BITTERLY REPENTING IT YOU WILL BITTERLY REPENT IT
2660-173229-0035 FAR MORE SENSITIVELY THAN SHE FELT THE THREAT SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS EVERYBODY HAD KNOWN IN THE HOUSE THAT SOME UNACKNOWLEDGED PROCEEDINGS OF YOURS IN LONDON HAD LED TO MISS GWILT'S VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL FROM HER SITUATION
2660-173229-0036 AND SHE NOW INFERRED FROM THE LANGUAGE ADDRESSED TO HER THAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY BELIEVED BY MISS GWILT TO HAVE SET THOSE PROCEEDINGS ON FOOT TO ADVANCE HERSELF
2660-173229-0037 I HAVEN'T QUITE DONE YET AS SOON AS MISS NEELIE HAD RECOVERED HERSELF SHE WENT UPSTAIRS TO SPEAK TO MISSUS MILROY MISS GWILT'S ABOMINABLE IMPUTATION HAD TAKEN HER BY SURPRISE
2660-173229-0038 SHE GOT NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER MISSUS MILROY DECLARED SHE WAS TOO ILL TO ENTER ON THE SUBJECT
2660-173229-0039 THE MAJOR STOPPED HER THE MOMENT YOUR NAME PASSED HER LIPS HE DECLARED HE WOULD NEVER HEAR YOU MENTIONED AGAIN BY ANY MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY SHE HAS BEEN LEFT IN THE DARK FROM THAT TIME TO THIS NOT KNOWING HOW SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISREPRESENTED BY MISS GWILT
2660-173229-0040 OR WHAT FALSEHOODS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE OF HER AT MY AGE AND IN MY PROFESSION I DON'T PROFESS TO HAVE ANY EXTRAORDINARY SOFTNESS OF HEART
2660-173229-0041 DESERVES OUR SYMPATHY I'LL DO ANYTHING TO HELP HER CRIED ALLAN IMPULSIVELY
2660-173229-0042 CONFUSEDLY REPEATED HIS FIRST WORDS
2660-173229-0043 ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TO HELP HER
2660-173229-0044 ASKED ALLAN ONLY TELL ME HOW BY GIVING ME YOUR AUTHORITY SIR TO PROTECT HER FROM MISS GWILT HAVING FIRED THAT SHOT POINTBLANK AT HIS CLIENT THE WISE LAWYER WAITED A LITTLE TO LET IT TAKE ITS EFFECT BEFORE HE SAID ANY MORE
2660-173229-0045 ALLAN'S FACE CLOUDED AND HE SHIFTED UNEASILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF HIS CHAIR YOUR SON IS HARD ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH MISTER PEDGIFT HE SAID AND YOU ARE HARDER THAN YOUR SON THANK YOU SIR REJOINED THE READY PEDGIFT
2660-173229-0046 IN MY SON'S NAME AND MY OWN FOR A HANDSOME COMPLIMENT TO THE FIRM
2660-173229-0047 HE WENT ON MORE SERIOUSLY I HAVE SHOWN YOU THE WAY YOU CAN DO NOTHING TO QUIET HER ANXIETY WHICH I HAVE NOT DONE ALREADY
2660-173229-0048 I CAN TELL YOU MISTER ARMADALE IT DWELLS ON MINE YOU KNOW MY OPINION OF MISS GWILT AND YOU KNOW WHAT MISS GWILT HERSELF HAS DONE THIS VERY EVENING TO JUSTIFY THAT OPINION EVEN IN YOUR EYES
2660-173229-0049 MAY I ASK AFTER ALL THAT HAS PASSED
2660-173229-0050 TO CONFINE HERSELF TO EMPTY THREATS THE QUESTION WAS A FORMIDABLE ONE TO ANSWER
2660-173229-0051 BY THE IRRESISTIBLE PRESSURE OF PLAIN FACTS ALLAN BEGAN FOR THE FIRST TIME TO SHOW SYMPTOMS OF YIELDING ON THE SUBJECT OF MISS GWILT IS THERE NO OTHER WAY OF PROTECTING MISS MILROY BUT THE WAY YOU HAVE MENTIONED HE ASKED UNEASILY
2660-173229-0052 ASKED PEDGIFT SENIOR SARCASTICALLY I'M RATHER AFRAID HE WOULDN'T HONOR ME WITH HIS ATTENTION OR PERHAPS YOU WOULD PREFER ALARMING MISS NEELIE BY TELLING HER IN PLAIN WORDS THAT WE BOTH THINK HER IN DANGER
2660-173229-0053 OR SUPPOSE YOU SEND ME TO MISS GWILT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO INFORM HER THAT SHE HAS DONE HER PUPIL A CRUEL INJUSTICE
2660-173229-0054 WOMEN ARE SO PROVERBIALLY READY TO LISTEN TO REASON AND THEY ARE SO UNIVERSALLY DISPOSED TO ALTER THEIR OPINIONS OF EACH OTHER ON APPLICATION ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE WOMAN THINKS THAT ANOTHER WOMAN HAS DESTROYED HER PROSPECT OF MAKING A GOOD MARRIAGE
2660-173229-0055 ONLY A LAWYER AND I CAN SIT WATERPROOF UNDER ANOTHER SHOWER OF MISS GWILT'S TEARS DAMN IT MISTER PEDGIFT TELL ME IN PLAIN WORDS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO CRIED ALLAN LOSING HIS TEMPER AT LAST
2660-173229-0056 IN PLAIN WORDS MISTER ARMADALE I WANT TO KEEP MISS GWILT'S PROCEEDINGS PRIVATELY UNDER VIEW AS LONG AS SHE STOPS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD I ANSWER FOR FINDING A PERSON WHO WILL LOOK AFTER HER DELICATELY AND DISCREETLY
2660-173229-0057 AND I AGREE TO DISCONTINUE EVEN THIS HARMLESS SUPERINTENDENCE OF HER ACTIONS IF THERE ISN'T GOOD REASONS SHOWN FOR CONTINUING IT TO YOUR ENTIRE SATISFACTION IN A WEEK'S TIME I MAKE THAT MODERATE PROPOSAL SIR IN WHAT I SINCERELY BELIEVE TO BE MISS MILROY'S INTEREST
2660-173229-0058 I WAIT YOUR ANSWER YES OR NO CAN'T I HAVE TIME TO CONSIDER ASKED ALLAN DRIVEN TO THE LAST HELPLESS EXPEDIENT OF TAKING REFUGE IN DELAY CERTAINLY MISTER ARMADALE BUT DON'T FORGET
2660-173229-0059 WHILE YOU ARE CONSIDERING THAT MISS MILROY IS IN THE HABIT OF WALKING OUT ALONE IN YOUR PARK INNOCENT OF ALL APPREHENSION OF DANGER AND THAT MISS GWILT IS PERFECTLY FREE TO TAKE ANY ADVANTAGE OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MISS GWILT PLEASES
2660-173229-0060 DO AS YOU LIKE EXCLAIMED ALLAN IN DESPAIR AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T TORMENT ME ANY LONGER POPULAR PREJUDICE MAY DENY IT BUT THE PROFESSION OF THE LAW IS A PRACTICALLY CHRISTIAN PROFESSION IN ONE RESPECT AT LEAST
2660-173229-0061 OF ALL THE LARGE COLLECTION OF READY ANSWERS LYING IN WAIT FOR MANKIND ON A LAWYER'S LIPS NONE IS KEPT IN BETTER WORKING ORDER THAN THE SOFT ANSWER WHICH TURNETH AWAY WRATH PEDGIFT SENIOR ROSE WITH THE ALACRITY OF YOUTH IN HIS LEGS
2660-173229-0062 AND THE WISE MODERATION OF AGE ON HIS TONGUE MANY THANKS SIR HE SAID FOR THE ATTENTION YOU HAVE BESTOWED ON ME I CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR DECISION AND I WISH YOU GOOD EVENING THIS TIME HIS INDICATIVE SNUFF BOX WAS NOT IN HIS HAND WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR
2660-173229-0063 AND HE ACTUALLY DISAPPEARED WITHOUT COMING BACK FOR A SECOND POSTSCRIPT
2660-173229-0064 IF IT WAS ONLY THE END OF THE WEEK HE THOUGHT LONGINGLY IF I ONLY HAD MIDWINTER BACK AGAIN
