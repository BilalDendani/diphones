6509-67147-0000 THE SCOTCH LADY OF ARISTOCRATIC BIRTH AND SOCIAL EXPERIENCE LIVED WITH ME ONE TERRIBLE WEEK ON THE SEVENTH DAY I CAME HOME FROM SHOPPING WITH PRESENTS FOR THE TWINS BACK IN WISCONSIN A DAY OR SO EARLIER WHILE MY MENTOR WAS OUT OF THE ROOM I HAD ASKED THE CHEF WAITER OF OUR FLOOR ABOUT HIMSELF
6509-67147-0001 AND TOM AND THE SCOTCH LADY WERE THERE THE CHEF WAITER WAS TAKING THE COATS OF THE GENTLEMEN CALLERS
6509-67147-0002 LADIES NEVER MAKE GIFTS TO THEIR SERVANTS SHE ADDED THEIR SECRETARIES HOUSEKEEPERS OR COMPANIONS DISBURSE THEIR BOUNTY I REMEMBERED THE OLD U S A AN AMERICAN CHEF WAITER MIGHT HOPE TO BE THE FATHER OF A PRESIDENT
6509-67147-0003 ON THE RANCH I HAD COOKED FOR MEN OF LESS EDUCATION AND MUCH WORSE MANNERS THAN THIS DOMESTIC WHO BROUGHT MY ATHLETIC HUSBAND'S BREAKFAST TO HIS BEDSIDE AND WHO HAPPENED TO BE THE PROUD FATHER OF TWINS I WOULD LEARN TABLE MANNERS FROM AN ENGLISH LADY OF ARISTOCRATIC BIRTH AND SOCIAL EXPERIENCE
6509-67147-0004 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE HUMAN ACT OF A LITTLE GIFT TO A FAITHFUL SERVANT I DECLARED MY AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE I WAS HOMESICK FOR WISCONSIN HOMESICK FOR REAL AND SIMPLE PEOPLE I WANTED TO GO HOME
6509-67147-0005 THAT NIGHT TOM AND I HAD OUR FIRST REAL QUARREL AND IT WAS OVER MY DISMISSAL OF THE SCOTCH LADY OF ARISTOCRATIC BIRTH LIFE BECAME INTOLERABLE FOR A WHILE I DRAGGED THROUGH DAYS OF BITTER HOMESICKNESS NOTHING SEEMED REAL NO ONE SEEMED SINCERE
6509-67147-0006 LIFE WAS A STAGE EVERYBODY SEEMED TO BE ACTING A PART AND SPEAKING THEIR PIECES WITH GUTTURAL VOICES EVEN MY HUSBAND'S VOICE SOUNDED DIFFERENT OR ELSE I REALIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT BOSTON APES LONDON ENGLISH TOM HAD LEARNED HIS MOTHER TONGUE IN BOSTON
6509-67147-0007 AND LONELY AND SENSITIVE I HAD DREAMED SO MUCH OF THIS WORLD AND NOW THAT I WAS IN IT IT WAS FALSE AND PETTY I LONGED FOR THE UNITED STATES FOR MY NORTHWEST FOR MY HILLS AND WIDE FAR PLAINS
6509-67147-0008 SUDDENLY IT SWEPT OVER ME THAT LIFE HAD GONE ALL WRONG HERE WAS A DREAM COME TRUE AND NO JOY IN MY HEART TOM ASKED ME FOR MY THOUGHTS I TOLD HIM QUITE FRANKLY I WAS THINKING OF HOME
6509-67147-0009 I WAS THINKING OF MOTHER IN HER COTTON HOUSE DRESS WITH HER KNITTED SHAWL AROUND HER SHOULDERS OF FATHER IN HIS JEANS AND HIGH BOOTS TRAMPING OVER THE RANGE WITH THE MEN I SAW THE COW AND THE PIGS AND THE CHICKENS
6509-67147-0010 HE NEVER DID IN ALL THE YEARS TOGETHER WHICH HE MADE SO RICH AND HAPPY TOM NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW HARD AND BITTER A SCHOOL WAS THAT FIRST YEAR OF MY MARRIED LIFE BUT TOM DID TRY TO GIVE ME A GOOD TIME IN LONDON
6509-67147-0011 THE THOUGHT OF THE COUNTRY AND A VISIT WITH SOME GOOD SIMPLE COUNTRY FOLK APPEALED TO ME TOO SO I PACKED THE BAGS AND MET TOM AT VICTORIA STATION AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ALAS IT IS A FAR CRY FROM A MONTANA RANCH TO A GENTLEMAN'S ESTATE IN ENGLAND
6509-67147-0012 WE WERE LED TO A HANDSOME CART DRAWN BY A FINE TANDEM TEAM AND TOM AND I WERE ALONE FOR A MINUTE MY GOD MARY HE BURST OUT DIDN'T YOU BRING ANY CLOTHES FOR US I CERTAINLY HAVE I RETORTED
6509-67147-0013 YOUR NIGHTSHIRT AND MY NIGHTGOWN YOUR TOILET ARTICLES AND MINE A CHANGE OF UNDERCLOTHES A CLEAN SHIRT AND TWO COLLARS FOR YOU
6509-67147-0014 YOU LL NEED ALL THE CLOTHES YOU HAVE DOWN HERE AND AND A VALET AND MAID WILL UNPACK THE BAGS OH HELL AFTER MORE OF THE SAME KIND OF TALK HE BEGAN TO COOK UP SOME YARN TO TELL THE VALET
6509-67147-0015 DOES A SERVANT REGULATE YOUR LIFE AND SET YOUR STANDARDS TOM WAS QUIET FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS THEN HE TOOK MY HAND AND SAID VERY EARNESTLY MARY DON'T YOU EVER LOSE YOUR RESPECT FOR THE REAL THINGS IT WILL SAVE BOTH OF US
6509-67147-0016 TOM WENT BACK TO LONDON ON THE NEXT TRAIN
6509-67147-0017 THE DINNER WAS LONG AND STUPID AFTER DINNER THE WOMEN WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND GOSSIPED ABOUT POLITICS AND PERSONALITIES UNTIL THE MEN JOINED THEM WHEN THEY SAT DOWN TO CARDS
6509-67147-0018 I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY CARDS AND SO WAS LEFT WITH A GARRULOUS OLD WOMAN WHO HAD EATEN AND DRUNK OVER MUCH IT HAD BEEN A LONG DAY FOR ME I WAS ILL AND TIRED SUDDENLY SLEEP BEGAN TO OVERPOWER ME I BATTED MY EYES TO KEEP THEM OPEN
6509-67147-0019 I TRIED LOOKING AT THE CRYSTAL LIGHTS BUT MY LEADEN EYES COULD NOT FACE THEM THE CONSTANT DRONE OF THAT OLD WOMAN WAS PUTTING ME TO SLEEP I TRIED TO SAY A FEW WORDS NOW AND THEN TO WAKE MYSELF I FELT MYSELF SLIPPING
6509-67147-0020 ONCE MY HEAD DROPPED AND CAME UP WITH A JERK I WATCHED THE GREAT FRENCH CLOCK ITS HANDS DID NOT SEEM TO MOVE I LOOKED AT TOM HE WAS ABSORBED IN HIS GAME I COULD NOT ENDURE IT ANOTHER MINUTE
6509-67147-0021 DROWSY AS I WAS I NOTICED SHE SEEMED SURPRISED
6509-67147-0022 IT WAS N'T DONE IN ENGLAND WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU CAN'T KEEP AWAKE I ASKED YOU SLIP OUT QUIETLY GO TO YOUR ROOM ASK A MAID TO CALL YOU AFTER YOU HAVE HAD FORTY WINKS
6509-67147-0023 NOT DULL AND QUIET LIKE THE ENGLISH DINNER AND EVER SO MUCH MORE FUN
6509-67147-0024 CARE FREE NATURAL SYMPATHETIC THERE WAS A LACK OF RESTRAINT WHICH AFTER THE OPPRESSIVE DIGNITY OF LONDON WAS A RARE TREAT NO ONE WAS CRITICAL EVERY ONE ACCEPTED MY HALTING AND FAULTY FRENCH WITHOUT RIDICULE OR CONDESCENSION
6509-67147-0025 THE AMIABILITY AND THE FRIENDLINESS OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE THAWED MY HEART AND BEGAN TO LIFT ME OUT OF MY SLOUGH OF HOMESICKNESS HAPPINESS CAME BACK TO ME THERE HAD BEEN HOURS IN ENGLAND WHEN ONLY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT A WOMAN'S RAREST GIFT WAS COMING TO ME
6509-67147-0026 AND THAT TOM WAS PROUD AND HAPPY ABOUT IT KEPT ME FROM RUNNING AWAY BACK TO THE SIMPLE LIFE OF MY OWN UNITED STATES I WAS HOMESICK FOR MOTHER BABIES WERE A MYSTERY TO ME ALTHOUGH I HAD HELPED MOTHER WITH ALL OF HERS
6509-67147-0027 WE HAD BURIED THREE OF THEM IN HOMEMADE COFFINS PIONEERING IS A RUTHLESS SCYTHE AND ONLY THE FIT SURVIVE I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND MY MOTHER AND THE GLORY IN THE CHARACTER WHICH NEVER FALTERED ALTHOUGH SHE WAS ALONE AND LIFE HAD BEEN HARD
6509-67147-0028 HOW COULD I WHINE WHEN I HAD TOM AND A GOOD FRIEND AND LIFE WAS LIKE A PLAYGROUND I LOVED THE FRENCH
6509-67147-0029 IT WAS MY ALL ABSORBING THOUGHT AND I WAS DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS IT FRANKLY MOTHERHOOD IS THE GREAT AND NATURAL EVENT IN THE LIFE OF A WOMAN IN FRANCE AND NO ONE MAKES A SECRET OF IT I WAS VERY HAPPY IN PARIS AND THEN
6509-67147-0030 UP TO ELEVEN O'CLOCK CERTAIN ATTIRE WAS PROPER IF YOUR WATCH STOPPED YOU WERE SURE TO BREAK A SOCIAL LAW I ONCE SAW A DISTINGUISHED DIPLOMAT IN DISTRESS BECAUSE HE FOUND HIMSELF AT AN OFFICIAL FUNCTION AT ELEVEN THIRTY WITH A BLACK TIE
6509-67147-0031 AT FIRST IT OFFENDED ME TO RECEIVE AN INVITATION OR A COMMAND TO APPEAR AT A FORMAL FUNCTION WITH AN ACCOMPANYING SLIP TELLING EXACTLY WHAT TO WEAR THEN I LAUGHED ABOUT IT FINALLY I REBELLED ON THE PLEA OF ILL HEALTH
6509-67147-0032 THE SECOND DAY IN LONDON TOM TOOK ME TO AN EXHIBITION IMPORTANT IN THE ART WORLD OR AT LEAST IN THE OFFICIAL LIFE OF LONDON EVERYBODY WHO WAS SOMEBODY WAS THERE I SAW THE PRINCESS OF WALES AND THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY
6509-67147-0033 WHO WAS THEN SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS I SAW MISTER BALFOUR SO HANDSOME AND GRACIOUS THAT I REFUSED TO BELIEVE THERE HAD EVER BEEN CAUSE TO CALL HIM BLOODY BALFOUR THERE WAS SOMETHING KINGLY ABOUT HIM YET HE WAS SIMPLY MISTER BALFOUR
6509-67147-0034 AND OF ONE COMING BLESSING IN PARTICULAR MISTER GLADSTONE JOINED US AND SIR HENRY IRVING CAME OVER TO SPEAK TO EVE SHE TOLD HIM I HAD JUST SAID THAT ENGLAND HAD A MOLD FOR HANDSOME MEN IRVING WAS INTERESTING AND STRIKING
6509-67147-0035 THOUGH CERTAINLY NOT HANDSOME BUT HE TOOK THE COMPLIMENT TO HIMSELF SMILED BOWED HIS THANKS AND SAID AND AMERICA FOR BEAUTIFUL WOMEN MISTER GLADSTONE TOO COULD INDULGE IN SMALL TALK
6509-67147-0036 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER ROSY CHEEKS BEFORE SHE WENT TO THE CONTINENT HE SAID AND ADDED KINDLY THAT I LOOKED VERY TIRED AND SHOULD GO DOWN TO HAWARDEN CASTLE AND REST OH I EXPLAINED HAPPILY IT IS N'T THAT
6509-67147-0037 FOR THE FIRST TIME I REALIZED THAT CUSTOM IS MERELY A MATTER OF GEOGRAPHY ONE TAKES OFF ONE'S SHOES TO ENTER THE PRESENCE OF THE RULER OF PERSIA
6509-67147-0038 ONE USES FISH KNIVES IN ENGLAND UNTIL HE DINES WITH ROYALTY THEN ONE MUST MANAGE WITH A FORK AND A PIECE OF BREAD ONE DRESSES FOR DINNER ALWAYS AND WAITS FOR THE HOSTESS TO SAY IT IS TIME AND SPEAKS ONLY TO ONE'S NEIGHBOR AT TABLE
6509-67147-0039 IN FRANCE ONE GUEST SPEAKS TO ANY OR ALL OF THE OTHERS ALL ONE'S FRIENDS EXTEND CONGRATULATIONS IF A BABY IS COMING ONE SHARES ALL HIS JOYS WITH FRIENDS BUT IN ENGLAND NOBODY MUST KNOW AND EVERYBODY MUST BE SURPRISED
6509-67147-0040 NO ONE EVER SPEAKS OF HIMSELF IN ENGLAND THEY ARE SENSITIVE ABOUT EVERYTHING PERSONAL BUT THERE IS AN UNDERGROUND AND VERY PERFECT SYSTEM BY WHICH EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYBODY IS KNOWN AND NOISED ABOUT AND DISCUSSED WITH EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE PERSON IN QUESTION
6509-67147-0041 IT IS A MYSTERIOUS AND ELABORATE HYPOCRISY WITH THE AID OF EVE I MADE A THOROUGH STUDY OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF SOCIAL CUSTOMS I LEARNED THE WAYS OF EUROPE OF THE ORIENT AND OF SOUTH AMERICA
6509-67147-0042 BUT I TOLD MYSELF WITH PRIDE THAT OUR TRULY CULTIVATED PEOPLE WILL NOT TOLERATE A SOCIAL FORM THAT IS NOT BASED ON HUMAN KINDLY INSTINCTS
