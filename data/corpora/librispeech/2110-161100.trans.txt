2110-161100-0000 HERR STEIN IS COMPLETELY DAFT ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS DAUGHTER SHE IS EIGHT YEARS OLD AND LEARNS EVERYTHING BY HEART SOMETHING MAY COME OF HER FOR SHE HAS TALENT BUT NOT IF SHE GOES ON AS SHE IS DOING NOW
2110-161100-0001 SHE WILL NEVER ACQUIRE VELOCITY BECAUSE SHE PURPOSELY MAKES HER HAND HEAVY SHE WILL NEVER LEARN THE MOST NECESSARY MOST DIFFICULT AND PRINCIPAL THING IN MUSIC THAT IS TIME
2110-161100-0002 BECAUSE FROM CHILDHOOD SHE HAS DESIGNEDLY CULTIVATED THE HABIT OF IGNORING THE BEAT AUGSBURG

2110-161100-0005 FIFTY ONE IF SHE DOES NOT GET SOME THOUGHTS AND IDEAS FOR NOW SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY NONE IT WILL ALL BE IN VAIN FOR GOD KNOWS I CAN NOT GIVE HER ANY
2110-161100-0006 IT IS NOT HER FATHER'S INTENTION TO MAKE A GREAT COMPOSER OUT OF HER SHE SHALL HE SAYS NOT WRITE ANY OPERAS OR ARIAS OR SYMPHONIES BUT ONLY GREAT SONATAS FOR HER INSTRUMENT AND MINE
2110-161100-0007 I GAVE HER HER FOURTH LESSON TODAY AND SO FAR AS THE RULES OF COMPOSITION AND HER EXERCISES ARE CONCERNED I AM PRETTY WELL SATISFIED WITH HER SHE WROTE A VERY GOOD BASS TO THE FIRST MINUET WHICH I SET HER
2110-161100-0008 UNFORTUNATELY SHE HAS NONE SHE MUST BE TAUGHT ARTIFICIALLY SHE HAS NO IDEAS THERE ARE NO RESULTS I HAVE TRIED IN EVERY SORT OF WAY AMONG OTHER THINGS IT OCCURRED TO ME TO WRITE DOWN
2110-161100-0009 A VERY SIMPLE MINUET AND TO SEE IF SHE COULD WRITE A VARIATION ON IT IN VAIN WELL THOUGHT I IT IS BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO BEGIN I THEN BEGAN A VARIATION OF THE FIRST MEASURE AND TOLD HER TO CONTINUE IT
2110-161100-0010 IN THE SAME MANNER THAT WENT FAIRLY WELL WHEN SHE HAD MADE AN END I ASKED HER TO BEGIN SOMETHING OF HER OWN ONLY THE FIRST VOICE A MELODY
2110-161100-0011 NOW LOOK WHAT AN ASS I AM I HAVE BEGUN A MINUET AND CAN'T FINISH EVEN THE FIRST PART BE GOOD ENOUGH TO FINISH IT FOR ME SHE THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE AT LENGTH SHE PRODUCED A LITTLE SOMETHING TO MY JOY
2110-161100-0012 THEN I MADE HER FINISH THE MINUET
2110-161100-0013 FOR HER HOME WORK I HAVE GIVEN HER NOTHING TO DO EXCEPT TO ALTER MY FOUR MEASURES AND MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THEM TO INVENT ANOTHER BEGINNING TO KEEP TO THE HARMONY IF SHE MUST BUT TO WRITE A NEW MELODY WE SHALL SEE WHAT COMES OF IT

2110-161100-0016 WAS ANYTHING BUT A NOBLEMAN FIFTY TWO THE ANDANTE IS GOING TO GIVE US THE MOST TROUBLE FOR IT IS FULL OF EXPRESSION AND MUST BE PLAYED WITH TASTE
2110-161100-0017 AND ACCURATELY AS WRITTEN IN THE MATTER OF FORTE AND PIANO SHE IS VERY CLEVER AND LEARNS QUICKLY THE RIGHT HAND IS VERY GOOD BUT THE LEFT UTTERLY RUINED I CAN SAY THAT I OFTEN PITY HER
2110-161100-0018 AND HER THAT IF I WERE HER REGULAR TEACHER I WOULD LOCK UP ALL HER MUSIC COVER THE KEYBOARD WITH A HANDKERCHIEF AND MAKE HER PRACTICE BOTH HANDS AT FIRST SLOWLY ON NOTHING BUT PASSAGES TRILLS MORDENTS ET CETERA
2110-161100-0019 UNTIL THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE LEFT HAND WAS REMEDIED AFTER THAT I AM SURE I COULD MAKE A REAL CLAVIER PLAYER OUT OF HER IT IS A PITY SHE HAS SO MUCH GENIUS READS RESPECTABLY HAS A GREAT DEAL OF NATURAL FLUENCY
2110-161100-0020 AND PLAYS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FEELING MANNHEIM NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER THE PUPIL WAS ROSE CANNABICH TO WHOM THE SONATA REFERRED TO IS DEDICATED

2110-161100-0022 THE ANDANTE FROM WHICH TROUBLE WAS EXPECTED WAS THAT WHICH MOZART WROTE WITH THE PURPOSE THAT IT SHOULD REFLECT THE CHARACTER OF ROSE CANNABICH A LOVELY AND AMIABLE GIRL ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS
2110-161100-0023 H E K FIFTY THREE THIS E IS VERY FORCED ONE CAN SEE THAT IT WAS WRITTEN ONLY TO GO FROM ONE CONSONANCE TO ANOTHER IN PARALLEL MOTION
2110-161100-0024 JUST AS BAD POETS WRITE NONSENSE FOR THE SAKE OF A RHYME FROM THE EXERCISE BOOK OF THE COUSIN OF ABBE STADLER WHO TOOK LESSONS IN THOROUGH BASS FROM MOZART IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR
2110-161100-0025 AND WHEN YOUR MIND WAS NOT DEVOTED TO OTHER PURSUITS YOU WOULD PERHAPS HAVE DONE WISELY BUT NOW THAT YOUR PROFESSION OF THE STAGE MUST AND OUGHT TO OCCUPY ALL YOUR ATTENTION
2110-161100-0026 IT WOULD BE AN UNWISE MEASURE TO ENTER INTO A DRY STUDY YOU MAY TAKE MY WORD FOR IT NATURE HAS MADE YOU A MELODIST AND YOU WOULD ONLY DISTURB AND PERPLEX YOURSELF REFLECT A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING
2110-161100-0027 SHOULD THERE BE ERRORS IN WHAT YOU WRITE YOU WILL FIND HUNDREDS OF MUSICIANS IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD CAPABLE OF CORRECTING THEM THEREFORE DO NOT DISTURB YOUR NATURAL GIFT TO MICHAEL KELLY THE IRISH TENOR

2110-161100-0031 IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX H E K FIFTY FIVE THIS IS GENERALLY THE CASE WITH ALL WHO DID NOT TASTE THE ROD OR FEEL THE TEACHER'S TONGUE WHEN BOYS
2110-161100-0032 BY MERE TALENT AND INCLINATION MANY SUCCEED FAIRLY WELL BUT WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS HAVING NONE OF THEIR OWN OTHERS WHO HAVE IDEAS OF THEIR OWN DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM THAT IS YOUR CASE
2110-161100-0033 IN A LETTER WRITTEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE TO A NOBLE FRIEND CRITICIZING A SYMPHONY FIFTY SIX DO NOT WONDER AT ME IT WAS NOT A CAPRICE
2110-161100-0034 I NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE MUSICIANS WERE OLD MEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO END OF DRAGGING IF I HAD NOT FIRST DRIVEN THEM INTO THE FIRE AND MADE THEM ANGRY OUT OF PURE RAGE THEY DID THEIR BEST

2110-161100-0037 THE REPRESENTATIVE OF ZERLINA DID NOT ACT REALISTICALLY ENOUGH TO SUIT MOZART THEREUPON HE WENT UNNOTICED ON THE STAGE AND AT THE REPETITION OF THE SCENE GRABBED THE SINGER SO RUDELY AND UNEXPECTEDLY
2110-161100-0038 THAT SHE INVOLUNTARILY UTTERED THE SHRIEK WHICH THE SCENE CALLED FOR
2110-161100-0039 THE PLACE PRAGUE AND THE TIME
