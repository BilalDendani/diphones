3885-12149-0000 BUT THE DRAGON WAS NOT ALONE NAUGHTY IT WAS BIG AND FIERCE AND STRONG AND DID NOT WANT TO BE DESTROYED AT ALL
3885-12149-0001 THEY ARE BY NATURE THICK SKINNED AND TOUGH AS DOUBTLESS EVERY ONE HAS HEARD
3885-12149-0002 FORGETFUL OF THE RESPECT DUE TO A CROWNED KING THE WICKED DRAGON PRESENTLY OPENING WIDE ITS JAWS AND BIT HIS MAJESTY'S HEAD CLEAN OFF HIS BODY
3885-12149-0003 SO HE TURNED AND TRIED TO FIND HIS WAY BACK TO HIS PEOPLE
3885-12149-0004 FURTHERMORE HE COULD NOT TELL IN WHICH DIRECTION HE WAS GOING WHICH IS AN UNPLEASANT FEELING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
3885-12149-0005 AT LAST SOME OF THE PEOPLE CAME TO SEE IF THE KING HAD SUCCEEDED IN DESTROYING THE DRAGON AND FOUND THEIR MONARCH RUNNING AROUND IN A CIRCLE BUMPING INTO TREES AND ROCKS BUT NOT GETTING A STEP NEARER HOME SO THEY TOOK HIS HAND
3885-12149-0006 WERE ALL EXCEEDINGLY PRETTY GIRLS AND SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE ONE MAN MADE A VERY NICE HEAD OUT OF CANDY AND BROUGHT IT TO THE KING IT DID NOT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE OLD HEAD BUT THE EFFACE WAS VERY SWEET NEVERTHELESS SO THE KING PUT IT ON
3885-12149-0007 THE YOUNG MAN HAD PUT A PAIR OF GLASS EYES IN THE HEAD WITH WHICH THE KING COULD SEE VERY WELL AFTER HE GOT USED TO THEM
3885-12149-0008 AND THEY WERE MARRIED AMID GREAT REJOICING BUT A FEW DAYS AFTERWARD THE KING WAS CAUGHT OUT IN A RAINSTORM AND BEFORE HE COULD GET HOME HIS NEW HEAD HAD MELTED IN THE GREAT SHOWER OF LEMONADE THAT FELL ONLY THE GLASS EYES WERE LEFT
3885-12149-0009 AND THESE HE PUT IN HIS POCKET AND WENT SORROWFULLY TO TELL THE QUEEN OF HIS NEW MISFORTUNE
3885-12149-0010 WHICH THE MONARCH FELT VERY LIGHT HEADED AND WHEN THE BIRDS SAW THE BREAD THEY FLEW DOWN FROM THE TREES
3885-12149-0011 AGAIN THE GOOD KING WAS FORCED TO GO HOME TO THE QUEEN WITHOUT A HEAD
3885-12149-0012 BETWEEN HIS THUMBS AND FINGERS THE GLASS EYES THAT THEY MIGHT GUIDE HIS FOOTSTEPS THIS AS YOU MAY IMAGINE MADE HIS MAJESTY LOOK RATHER UNDIGNIFIED
3885-12149-0013 IT WAS NEATLY CARVED BESIDES BEING SOLID AND DURABLE MOREOVER IT FITTED THE MONARCH'S NECK TO THE T SO THE KING RUMMAGED IN HIS POCKET AND FOUND THE GLASS EYES AND WHEN THESE WERE PUT IN THE NEW HEAD THE KING ANNOUNCED HIS SATISFACTION
3885-12149-0014 BUT THE GLASS EYES TWINKLED MERRILY AND EVERY ONE KNEW
3885-12149-0015 THEN THE KING SENT WORD TO THE WOOD CHOPPER TO COME TO THE PALACE AND TAKE HIS PICK OF THE PRINCESSES AND PREPARATIONS WERE AT ONCE BEGUN FOR THE WEDDING BUT THE WOOD CHOPPER ON HIS WAY TO THE COURT UNFORTUNATELY PASSED BY THE DWELLING OF THE PURPLE DRAGON AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO THE MONSTER
3885-12149-0016 NOW IT SEEMS THAT WHEN THE DRAGON HAD SWALLOWED THE KING'S HEAD THE UNUSUAL MEAL MADE THE BEAST ILL IT WAS MORE ACCUSTOMED TO BERRIES AND CARAMELS FOR DINNER THAN TO HEADS AND THE SHARP POINTS OF THE KING'S CROWN WHICH WAS FIRMLY FASTENED TO THE HEAD PRICKED THE DRAGON'S STOMACH AND MADE THE CREATURE MISERABLE
3885-12149-0017 STEP INTO MY PARLOR AND REST YOURSELF SAID THE DRAGON POLITELY WICKED PEOPLE ARE MOST POLITE WHEN THEY MEAN MISCHIEF THANK YOU I'LL STOP FOR A FEW MINUTES REPLIED THE WOOD CHOPPER
3885-12149-0018 BUT I CAN NOT STAY LONG AS I AM EXPECTED AT COURT WHEN HE HAD ENTERED THE PARLOR THE DRAGON SUDDENLY OPENED ITS MOUTH AND SNAPPED OFF THE POOR WOOD CHOPPER'S HEAD
3885-12149-0019 GO HOME AND CLAIM YOUR WIFE AND YOUR KINGDOM
3885-12149-0020 HE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND SEEING THE KING MADE A LOW BOW THEN THE KING'S HEAD THOUGHT WHO AM I BOWING TO THERE IS NO ONE GREATER THAN THE KING AND SO AT ONCE THERE BEGAN A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE WOOD CHOPPER'S HEART AND THE KING'S HEAD
3885-12149-0021 WHEN THE POOR MAN NEARED THE TOWN THE PEOPLE RAN OUT AND SAID WHY THIS IS THE KING COME BACK AGAIN ALL HAIL YOUR MAJESTY
3885-12149-0022 RETURNED THE WOOD CHOPPER I AM ONLY A POOR MAN WITH THE KING'S HEAD ON MY SHOULDERS YOU CAN EASILY SEE IT ISN'T MINE FOR IT'S CROOKED THE DRAGON DIDN'T GLUE IT ON STRAIGHT
3885-12149-0023 LOCKED UP IN THE DRAGON'S CUPBOARD REPLIED THE POOR FELLOW BEGINNING TO WEEP HERE CRIED THE KING'S HEAD
3885-12149-0024 WELL SEE THAT YOU DON'T RETURNED THE HEAD MORE CHEERFULLY
3885-12149-0025 I'M SORRY SIGHED THE QUEEN FOR I LIKE TO KISS THE REAL HEAD BEST AND SO YOU SHALL SAID THE KING'S HEAD I DON'T APPROVE YOUR KISSING THAT WOODEN HEAD AT ALL THE POOR LADY LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER IN PERPLEXITY
3885-12149-0026 WHY DON'T YOU TRADE HEADS SHE ASKED JUST THE THING CRIED THE KING
3885-12149-0027 THE WOOD CHOPPER HOWEVER DID NOT EVEN SMILE HE COULDN'T BECAUSE OF THE WOODEN FACE
3885-12149-0028 BRING HITHER THE PRINCESSES COMMANDED THE KING
3885-12149-0029 I PROMISED HIM ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS HE ARGUED AND A KING NEVER BREAKS HIS WORD BUT HE HADN'T A WOODEN HEAD THEN EXPLAINED ONE OF THE GIRLS
3885-12149-0030 SHE WOULD CALL HER HUSBAND A BLOCKHEAD A TERM ALMOST CERTAIN TO CAUSE TROUBLE IN ANY FAMILY
3885-12149-0031 THE WOOD CHOPPER WAS A BRAVE MAN
3885-12149-0032 THE WOODEN HEAD CAME OFF AT ONCE AND THE DRAGON'S LONG SHARP TEETH GOT STUCK IN THE WOOD AND WOULD NOT COME OUT AGAIN SO THE MONSTER WAS UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT FLOP ITS TAIL AND GROAN THE WOOD CHOPPER NOW RAN TO THE CUPBOARD TOOK OUT HIS HEAD AND PLACED IT UPON HIS SHOULDERS WHERE IT BELONGED
