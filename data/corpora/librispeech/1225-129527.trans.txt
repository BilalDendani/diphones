1225-129527-0000 AT SIX HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE WELL
1225-129527-0001 THEY PRODUCED A MOST SINGULAR EFFECT
1225-129527-0002 AND IN PARTICULAR THE WHITE DESCRIPTION THIS METAL IN FACT IS THE MOST TENACIOUS
1225-129527-0003 CAST IRON HOWEVER IF SUBJECTED TO ONLY ONE SINGLE FUSION IS RARELY SUFFICIENTLY HOMOGENEOUS AND IT REQUIRES A SECOND FUSION COMPLETELY TO REFINE IT BY DISPOSSESSING IT OF ITS LAST EARTHLY DEPOSITS
1225-129527-0004 SO LONG BEFORE BEING FORWARDED TO TAMPA TOWN THE IRON ORE MOLTEN IN THE GREAT FURNACES OF COLDSPRING
1225-129527-0005 HEATED TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE WAS CARBURIZED AND TRANSFORMED INTO CAST IRON AFTER THIS FIRST OPERATION THE METAL WAS SENT ON TO STONES HILL THEY HAD HOWEVER
1225-129527-0006 A QUANTITY FAR TOO COSTLY TO SEND BY RAILWAY THE COST OF TRANSPORT WOULD HAVE BEEN DOUBLE THAT OF MATERIAL IT APPEARED PREFERABLE TO FREIGHT VESSELS AT NEW YORK AND TO LOAD THEM WITH THE IRON IN BARS
1225-129527-0007 THIS HOWEVER REQUIRED NOT LESS THAN SIXTY EIGHT VESSELS OF ONE THOUSAND TONS A VERITABLE FLEET WHICH QUITTING NEW YORK ON THE THIRD OF MAY ON THE TENTH OF THE SAME MONTH ASCENDED THE BAY OF ESPIRITU SANTO AND DISCHARGED THEIR CARGOES
1225-129527-0008 WITHOUT DUES IN THE PORT AT TAMPA TOWN THENCE THE IRON WAS TRANSPORTED BY RAIL TO STONES HILL AND ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY THIS ENORMOUS MASS OF METAL WAS DELIVERED AT ITS DESTINATION
1225-129527-0009 THEY WERE ALL BUILT AFTER THE MODEL OF THOSE WHICH SERVED FOR THE CASTING OF THE RODMAN GUN THEY WERE TRAPEZOIDAL IN SHAPE WITH A HIGH ELLIPTICAL ARCH THESE FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF FIREPROOF BRICK
1225-129527-0010 THIS BOTTOM INCLINED AT AN ANGLE OF TWENTY FIVE DEGREES ALLOWED THE METAL TO FLOW INTO THE RECEIVING TROUGHS
1225-129527-0011 CARRIED THE MOLTEN METAL DOWN TO THE CENTRAL WELL THE DAY FOLLOWING THAT ON WHICH THE WORKS OF THE MASONRY AND BORING HAD BEEN COMPLETED BARBICANE SET TO WORK UPON THE CENTRAL MOULD
1225-129527-0012 HIS OBJECT NOW WAS TO RAISE WITHIN THE CENTER OF THE WELL AND WITH A COINCIDENT AXIS A CYLINDER NINE HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND NINE FEET IN DIAMETER WHICH SHOULD EXACTLY FILL UP THE SPACE RESERVED FOR THE BORE OF THE COLUMBIAD
1225-129527-0013 THIS CYLINDER WAS COMPOSED OF A MIXTURE OF CLAY AND SAND WITH THE ADDITION OF A LITTLE HAY AND STRAW THE SPACE LEFT BETWEEN THE MOULD AND THE MASONRY WAS INTENDED TO BE FILLED UP BY THE MOLTEN METAL
1225-129527-0014 WHICH WOULD THUS FORM THE WALLS SIX FEET IN THICKNESS THIS CYLINDER IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS EQUILIBRIUM HAD TO BE BOUND BY IRON BANDS AND FIRMLY FIXED AT CERTAIN INTERVALS BY CROSS CLAMPS FASTENED INTO THE STONE LINING
1225-129527-0015 AFTER THE CASTINGS THESE WOULD BE BURIED IN THE BLOCK OF METAL LEAVING NO EXTERNAL PROJECTION THIS OPERATION WAS COMPLETED ON THE EIGHTH OF JULY AND THE RUN OF THE METAL WAS FIXED FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY
1225-129527-0016 THIS FETE OF THE CASTING WILL BE A GRAND CEREMONY SAID J T MASTON TO HIS FRIEND BARBICANE UNDOUBTEDLY SAID BARBICANE BUT IT WILL NOT BE A PUBLIC FETE WHAT
1225-129527-0017 WILL YOU NOT OPEN THE GATES OF THE ENCLOSURE TO ALL COMERS I MUST BE VERY CAREFUL MASTON THE CASTING OF THE COLUMBIAD IS AN EXTREMELY DELICATE NOT TO SAY A DANGEROUS OPERATION
1225-129527-0018 AND I SHOULD PREFER ITS BEING DONE PRIVATELY AT THE DISCHARGE OF THE PROJECTILE A FETE IF YOU LIKE TILL THEN NO THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT THE OPERATION INVOLVED UNFORESEEN DANGERS
1225-129527-0019 WHICH A GREAT INFLUX OF SPECTATORS WOULD HAVE HINDERED HIM FROM AVERTING IT WAS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE COMPLETE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT NO ONE WAS ADMITTED WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE EXCEPT A DELEGATION OF MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB WHO HAD MADE THE VOYAGE TO TAMPA TOWN
1225-129527-0020 AMONG THESE WAS THE BRISK BILSBY TOM HUNTER COLONEL BLOMSBERRY MAJOR ELPHINSTONE GENERAL MORGAN AND THE REST OF THE LOT TO WHOM THE CASTING OF THE COLUMBIAD
1225-129527-0021 J T MASTON BECAME THEIR CICERONE HE OMITTED NO POINT OF DETAIL HE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGHOUT THE MAGAZINES WORKSHOPS THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE ENGINES
1225-129527-0022 ONE AFTER THE OTHER AT THE END OF THE TWELVE HUNDREDTH VISIT THEY WERE PRETTY WELL KNOCKED UP THE CASTING WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT TWELVE O'CLOCK PRECISELY THE PREVIOUS EVENING EACH FURNACE HAD BEEN CHARGED
1225-129527-0023 SO AS TO ALLOW THE HOT AIR TO CIRCULATE FREELY BETWEEN THEM
1225-129527-0024 AS MANY POUNDS OF METAL AS THERE WERE TO CAST SO MANY POUNDS OF COAL WERE THERE TO BURN THUS THERE WERE SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND TONS OF COAL WHICH PROJECTED IN THE FACE OF THE SUN A THICK CURTAIN OF SMOKE
1225-129527-0025 THE RUMBLING OF WHICH RESEMBLED THE ROLLING OF THUNDER THE POWERFUL VENTILATORS ADDED THEIR CONTINUOUS BLASTS AND SATURATED WITH OXYGEN THE GLOWING PLATES THE OPERATION TO BE SUCCESSFUL
1225-129527-0026 REQUIRED TO BE CONDUCTED WITH GREAT RAPIDITY ON A SIGNAL GIVEN BY A CANNON SHOT EACH FURNACE WAS TO GIVE VENT TO THE MOLTEN IRON AND COMPLETELY TO EMPTY ITSELF THESE ARRANGEMENTS MADE
1225-129527-0027 FOREMEN AND WORKMEN WAITED THE PRECONCERTED MOMENT WITH AN IMPATIENCE MINGLED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EMOTION NOT A SOUL REMAINED WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE EACH SUPERINTENDENT TOOK HIS POST BY THE APERTURE OF THE RUN
1225-129527-0028 PERCHED ON A NEIGHBORING EMINENCE ASSISTED AT THE OPERATION IN FRONT OF THEM WAS A PIECE OF ARTILLERY READY TO GIVE FIRE ON THE SIGNAL FROM THE ENGINEER SOME MINUTES BEFORE MIDDAY THE FIRST DRIBLETS OF METAL BEGAN TO FLOW
1225-129527-0029 THE RESERVOIRS FILLED LITTLE BY LITTLE AND
1225-129527-0030 TWELVE O'CLOCK STRUCK A GUNSHOT SUDDENLY PEALED FORTH AND SHOT ITS FLAME INTO THE AIR TWELVE HUNDRED MELTING TROUGHS WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY OPENED AND TWELVE HUNDRED FIERY SERPENTS CREPT TOWARD THE CENTRAL WELL
1225-129527-0031 UNROLLING THEIR INCANDESCENT CURVES THERE DOWN THEY PLUNGED WITH A TERRIFIC NOISE INTO A DEPTH OF NINE HUNDRED FEET IT WAS AN EXCITING AND A MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE THE GROUND TREMBLED
1225-129527-0032 WHILE THESE MOLTEN WAVES LAUNCHING INTO THE SKY THEIR WREATHS OF SMOKE EVAPORATED THE MOISTURE OF THE MOULD AND HURLED IT UPWARD THROUGH THE VENT HOLES OF THE STONE LINING IN THE FORM OF DENSE VAPOR CLOUDS
1225-129527-0033 ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NEITHER ANY ERUPTION NOR TYPHOON NOR STORM NOR STRUGGLE OF THE ELEMENTS NOR ANY OF THOSE TERRIBLE PHENOMENA WHICH NATURE IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING NO IT WAS MAN ALONE WHO HAD PRODUCED THESE REDDISH VAPORS
1225-129527-0034 THESE GIGANTIC FLAMES WORTHY OF A VOLCANO ITSELF
1225-129527-0035 THESE REVERBERATIONS RIVALING THOSE OF HURRICANES AND STORMS
