8675-295195-0000 THE NUTCRACKERS OF NUTCRACKER LODGE
8675-295195-0001 THEY WERE ANIMALS OF A SETTLED AND SERIOUS TURN OF MIND NOT DISPOSED TO RUN AFTER VANITIES AND NOVELTIES BUT FILLING THEIR STATION IN LIFE WITH PRUDENCE AND SOBRIETY NUTCRACKER LODGE
8675-295195-0002 WAS A HOLE IN A STURDY OLD CHESTNUT OVERHANGING A SHADY DELL AND WAS HELD TO BE AS RESPECTABLY KEPT AN ESTABLISHMENT AS THERE WAS IN THE WHOLE FOREST EVEN MISS JENNY WREN THE GREATEST GOSSIP OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
8675-295195-0003 NEVER FOUND ANYTHING TO CRITICISE IN ITS ARRANGEMENTS AND OLD PARSON TOO WHIT A VENERABLE OWL WHO INHABITED A BRANCH SOMEWHAT MORE EXALTED AS BECAME HIS PROFESSION
8675-295195-0004 WAS IN THE HABIT OF SAVING HIMSELF MUCH TROUBLE IN HIS PAROCHIAL EXHORTATIONS BY TELLING HIS PARISHIONERS IN SHORT TO LOOK AT THE NUTCRACKERS IF THEY WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS TO LIVE A VIRTUOUS LIFE
8675-295195-0005 EVERYTHING HAD GONE ON PROSPEROUSLY WITH THEM AND THEY HAD REARED MANY SUCCESSIVE FAMILIES OF YOUNG NUTCRACKERS WHO WENT FORTH TO ASSUME THEIR PLACES IN THE FOREST OF LIFE AND TO REFLECT CREDIT ON THEIR BRINGING UP
8675-295195-0006 BUT AT LAST IT CAME ALONG IN THE COURSE OF EVENTS
8675-295195-0007 YOUNG FEATHERHEAD WAS A SQUIRREL OF GOOD PARTS AND A LIVELY DISPOSITION BUT HE WAS SULKY AND CONTRARY AND UNREASONABLE AND ALWAYS FINDING MATTER OF COMPLAINT IN EVERYTHING HIS RESPECTABLE PAPA AND MAMMA DID
8675-295195-0008 INSTEAD OF ASSISTING IN THE CARES OF A FAMILY PICKING UP NUTS AND LEARNING OTHER LESSONS PROPER TO A YOUNG SQUIRREL HE SEEMED TO SETTLE HIMSELF FROM HIS EARLIEST YEARS INTO A SORT OF LOFTY CONTEMPT FOR THE NUTCRACKERS FOR NUTCRACKER LODGE
8675-295195-0009 AND FOR ALL THE GOOD OLD WAYS AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE DOMESTIC HOLE WHICH HE DECLARED TO BE STUPID AND UNREASONABLE AND ENTIRELY BEHIND THE TIMES TO BE SURE HE WAS ALWAYS ON HAND AT MEAL TIMES
8675-295195-0010 AND PLAYED A VERY LIVELY TOOTH ON THE NUTS WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD COLLECTED ALWAYS SELECTING THE VERY BEST FOR HIMSELF BUT HE SEASONED HIS NIBBLING WITH SO MUCH GRUMBLING AND DISCONTENT AND SO MANY SEVERE REMARKS AS TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT
8675-295195-0011 HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF A PECULIARLY ILL USED SQUIRREL IN HAVING TO EAT THEIR OLD GRUB AS HE VERY UNCEREMONIOUSLY CALLED IT PAPA NUTCRACKER ON THESE OCCASIONS WAS OFTEN FIERCELY INDIGNANT
8675-295195-0012 AND POOR LITTLE MAMMA NUTCRACKER WOULD SHED TEARS AND BEG HER DARLING TO BE A LITTLE MORE REASONABLE BUT THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN SEEMED ALWAYS TO CONSIDER HIMSELF AS THE INJURED PARTY
8675-295195-0013 NOW NOBODY COULD TELL WHY OR WHEREFORE MASTER FEATHERHEAD LOOKED UPON HIMSELF AS INJURED OR AGGRIEVED SINCE HE WAS LIVING IN A GOOD HOLE WITH PLENTY TO EAT AND WITHOUT THE LEAST CARE OR LABOUR OF HIS OWN
8675-295195-0014 BUT HE SEEMED RATHER TO VALUE HIMSELF UPON BEING GLOOMY AND DISSATISFIED WHILE HIS PARENTS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE CHEERFULLY RACING UP AND DOWN THE BRANCHES BUSY IN THEIR DOMESTIC TOILS AND LAYING UP STORES FOR THE WINTER
8675-295195-0015 FEATHERHEAD SAT GLOOMILY APART DECLARING HIMSELF WEARY OF EXISTENCE AND FEELING HIMSELF AT LIBERTY TO QUARREL WITH EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM NOBODY UNDERSTOOD HIM HE SAID
8675-295195-0016 HE WAS A SQUIRREL OF A PECULIAR NATURE AND NEEDED PECULIAR TREATMENT AND NOBODY TREATED HIM IN A WAY THAT DID NOT GRATE ON THE FINER NERVES OF HIS FEELINGS HE HAD
8675-295195-0017 HIGHER NOTIONS OF EXISTENCE THAN COULD BE BOUNDED BY THAT OLD ROTTEN HOLE IN A HOLLOW TREE HE HAD THOUGHTS THAT SOARED FAR ABOVE THE MISERABLE PETTY DETAILS OF EVERY DAY LIFE
8675-295195-0018 AND HE COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT BRING DOWN THESE SOARING ASPIRATIONS TO THE CONTEMPTIBLE TOIL OF LAYING UP A FEW CHESTNUTS OR HICKORY NUTS FOR WINTER DEPEND UPON IT MY DEAR SAID MISSUS NUTCRACKER SOLEMNLY
8675-295195-0019 THAT FELLOW MUST BE A GENIUS FIDDLESTICK ON HIS GENIUS SAID OLD MISTER NUTCRACKER WHAT DOES HE DO OH NOTHING OF COURSE THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST MARKS OF GENIUS
8675-295195-0020 GENIUSES YOU KNOW NEVER CAN COME DOWN TO COMMON LIFE HE EATS ENOUGH FOR ANY TWO REMARKED OLD NUTCRACKER AND HE NEVER HELPS TO GATHER NUTS MY DEAR ASK PARSON TOO WHIT HE HAS CONVERSED WITH HIM
8675-295195-0021 WHEN A FELLOW EATS ALL THE NUTS THAT HIS MOTHER GIVES HIM AND THEN GRUMBLES AT HER
8675-295195-0022 WHY DON'T HE SET HIMSELF ABOUT SOMETHING I'M GOING TO TELL MY FINE YOUNG GENTLEMAN THAT IF HE DOESN'T BEHAVE HIMSELF I'LL TUMBLE HIM OUT OF THE NEST NECK AND CROP AND SEE IF HUNGER WON'T DO SOMETHING TOWARDS BRINGING DOWN HIS FINE AIRS
8675-295195-0023 BUT THEN MISSUS NUTCRACKER FELL ON HER HUSBAND'S NECK WITH BOTH PAWS AND WEPT AND BESOUGHT HIM SO PITEOUSLY TO HAVE PATIENCE WITH HER DARLING THAT OLD NUTCRACKER WHO WAS HIMSELF A SOFT HEARTED OLD SQUIRREL
8675-295195-0024 WAS PREVAILED UPON TO PUT UP WITH THE AIRS AND GRACES OF HIS YOUNG SCAPEGRACE A LITTLE LONGER AND SECRETLY IN HIS SILLY OLD HEART HE REVOLVED THE QUESTION WHETHER POSSIBLY IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT A GREAT GENIUS WAS ACTUALLY TO COME OF HIS HOUSEHOLD
8675-295195-0025 THE NUTCRACKERS BELONGED TO THE OLD ESTABLISHED RACE OF THE GRAYS BUT THEY WERE SOCIABLE FRIENDLY PEOPLE AND KEPT ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH ALL BRANCHES OF THE NUTCRACKER FAMILY THE CHIPMUNKS OF CHIPMUNK HOLLOW
8675-295195-0026 WERE A VERY LIVELY CHEERFUL SOCIABLE RACE AND ON THE VERY BEST OF TERMS WITH THE NUTCRACKER GRAYS YOUNG TIP CHIPMUNK THE OLDEST SON WAS IN ALL RESPECTS A PERFECT CONTRAST TO MASTER FEATHERHEAD
8675-295195-0027 HE WAS ALWAYS LIVELY AND CHEERFUL AND SO VERY ALERT IN PROVIDING FOR THE FAMILY THAT OLD MISTER AND MISSUS CHIPMUNK HAD VERY LITTLE CARE BUT COULD SIT SOCIABLY AT THE DOOR OF THEIR HOLE AND CHAT WITH NEIGHBOURS
8675-295195-0028 QUITE SURE THAT TIP WOULD BRING EVERYTHING OUT RIGHT FOR THEM AND HAVE PLENTY LAID UP FOR WINTER NOW FEATHERHEAD TOOK IT UPON HIM FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER TO LOOK DOWN UPON TIP CHIPMUNK AND ON
8675-295195-0029 EVERY OCCASION TO DISPARAGE HIM IN THE SOCIAL CIRCLE AS A VERY COMMON KIND OF SQUIRREL WITH WHOM IT WOULD BE BEST NOT TO ASSOCIATE TOO FREELY MY DEAR SAID MISSUS NUTCRACKER ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS EXPRESSING THESE IDEAS
8675-295195-0030 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE TOO HARD ON POOR TIP HE IS A MOST EXCELLENT SON AND BROTHER AND I WISH YOU WOULD BE CIVIL TO HIM OH I DON'T DOUBT THAT TIP IS GOOD ENOUGH SAID FEATHERHEAD CARELESSLY
8675-295195-0031 BUT THEN HE IS SO VERY COMMON HE HASN'T AN IDEA IN HIS SKULL ABOVE HIS NUTS AND HIS HOLE HE IS GOOD NATURED ENOUGH TO BE SURE THESE VERY ORDINARY PEOPLE OFTEN ARE GOOD NATURED BUT HE WANTS MANNER
8675-295195-0032 HE HAS REALLY NO MANNER AT ALL AND AS TO THE DEEPER FEELINGS TIP HASN'T THE REMOTEST IDEA OF THEM I MEAN ALWAYS TO BE CIVIL TO TIP WHEN HE COMES IN MY WAY
8675-295195-0033 BUT I THINK THE LESS WE SEE OF THAT SORT OF PEOPLE THE BETTER AND I HOPE MOTHER YOU WON'T INVITE THE CHIPMUNKS AT CHRISTMAS THESE FAMILY DINNERS ARE SUCH A BORE
8675-295195-0034 BUT MY DEAR YOUR FATHER THINKS A GREAT DEAL OF THE CHIPMUNKS AND IT IS AN OLD FAMILY CUSTOM TO HAVE ALL THE RELATIVES HERE AT CHRISTMAS AND AN AWFUL BORE IT IS
8675-295195-0035 WHY MUST PEOPLE OF REFINEMENT AND ELEVATION BE FOREVER TIED DOWN BECAUSE OF SOME DISTANT RELATIONSHIP NOW THERE ARE OUR COUSINS THE HIGH FLYERS IF WE COULD GET THEM THERE WOULD BE SOME SENSE IN IT
8675-295195-0036 YOUNG WHISK RATHER PROMISED ME FOR CHRISTMAS
8675-295195-0037 AND IF WE ARE INTIMATE WITH THE CHIPMUNKS IT ISN'T TO BE EXPECTED CONFOUND HIM FOR A PUPPY SAID OLD NUTCRACKER WHEN HIS WIFE REPEATED THESE SAYINGS TO HIM FEATHERHEAD IS A FOOL COMMON FORSOOTH
8675-295195-0038 I WISH GOOD INDUSTRIOUS PAINSTAKING SONS LIKE TIP CHIPMUNK WERE COMMON FOR MY PART I FIND THESE UNCOMMON PEOPLE THE MOST TIRESOME THEY ARE NOT CONTENT WITH LETTING US CARRY THE WHOLE LOAD
8675-295195-0039 BUT THEY SIT ON IT AND SCOLD AT US WHILE WE CARRY THEM
8675-295195-0040 FOUND THAT CHRISTMAS DINNERS AND OTHER THINGS WERE APT TO GO AS HIS WIFE SAID AND HIS WIFE WAS APT TO GO AS YOUNG FEATHERHEAD SAID AND SO WHEN CHRISTMAS CAME THE CHIPMUNKS WERE NOT INVITED
8675-295195-0041 AND YOUNG TIP LOOKED IN ON CHRISTMAS MORNING WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON AND A FEW BEECH NUTS WHICH HE HAD SECURED AS A GREAT DAINTY THE FACT WAS THAT
8675-295195-0042 THAT HE NEVER COULD BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANY OF HIS RELATIONS COULD WANT TO CUT HIM AND THEREFORE FEATHERHEAD LOOKED DOWN ON HIM WITH CONTEMPT
8675-295195-0043 HE HAD NO TACT AND COULDN'T SEE WHEN HE WAS NOT WANTED IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE HOW BY MEANS OF PERSISTING IN REMARKS LIKE THESE YOUNG FEATHERHEAD AT LAST GOT ALL HIS FAMILY TO LOOK UP TO HIM AS SOMETHING UNCOMMON
8675-295195-0044 THOUGH HE ADDED NOTHING TO THE FAMILY AND REQUIRED MORE TO BE DONE FOR HIM THAN ALL THE OTHERS PUT TOGETHER THOUGH HE SHOWED NOT THE SMALLEST REAL PERSEVERANCE OR ABILITY IN ANYTHING USEFUL
8675-295195-0045 YET SOMEHOW ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND HIS POOR FOOLISH OLD MOTHER GOT INTO A WAY OF REGARDING HIM AS SOMETHING WONDERFUL AND DELIGHTING IN HIS SHARP SAYINGS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THE WISEST THINGS IN THE WORLD
8675-295195-0046 BUT AT LAST OLD PAPA DECLARED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR FEATHERHEAD TO SETTLE HIMSELF TO SOME BUSINESS IN LIFE ROUNDLY DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT ALWAYS HAVE HIM AS A HANGER ON IN THE PATERNAL HOLE
8675-295195-0047 WE ARE DRIVING NOW A THRIVING TRADE IN HICKORY NUTS AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US
8675-295195-0048 THE FACT WAS THAT FEATHERHEAD HAD LATELY BEEN FORMING ALLIANCES SUCH AS NO REPUTABLE SQUIRREL SHOULD EVEN THINK OF HE HAD MORE THAN ONCE BEEN SEEN GOING OUT EVENINGS WITH THE RATS OF RAT HOLLOW
8675-295195-0049 A RACE WHOSE REPUTATION FOR HONESTY WAS MORE THAN DOUBTFUL THE FACT WAS FURTHER THAT OLD LONGTOOTH RAT AN OLD SHARPER AND MONEY LENDER HAD LONG HAD HIS EYE ON FEATHERHEAD AS JUST ABOUT SILLY ENOUGH FOR THEIR PURPOSES
8675-295195-0050 ENGAGING HIM IN WHAT HE CALLED A SPECULATION BUT WHICH WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN DOWNRIGHT STEALING NEAR BY THE CHESTNUT TREE
8675-295195-0051 WAS A LARGE BARN FILLED WITH CORN AND GRAIN BESIDES MANY BUSHELS OF HAZEL NUTS CHESTNUTS AND WALNUTS NOW OLD LONGTOOTH PROPOSED TO YOUNG FEATHERHEAD THAT HE SHOULD NIBBLE A PASSAGE INTO THIS LOFT
8675-295195-0052 AND THERE ESTABLISH HIMSELF IN THE COMMISSION BUSINESS PASSING THE NUTS AND CORN TO HIM AS HE WANTED THEM OLD LONGTOOTH KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT IN THE PROPOSAL FOR HE HAD HEARD TALK OF A BRISK SCOTCH TERRIER THAT WAS ABOUT TO BE BOUGHT
8675-295195-0053 TO KEEP THE RATS FROM THE GRAIN BUT YOU MAY BE SURE HE KEPT HIS KNOWLEDGE TO HIMSELF SO THAT FEATHERHEAD WAS NONE THE WISER FOR IT THE NONSENSE OF FELLOWS LIKE TIP CHIPMUNK SAID FEATHERHEAD TO HIS ADMIRING BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8675-295195-0054 THE PERFECTLY STUPID NONSENSE THERE HE GOES DELVING AND POKING PICKING UP A NUT HERE AND A GRAIN THERE WHEN I STEP INTO PROPERTY AT ONCE
8675-295195-0055 BUT I HOPE MY SON YOU ARE CAREFUL TO BE HONEST IN YOUR DEALINGS SAID OLD NUTCRACKER WHO WAS A VERY MORAL SQUIRREL WITH THAT YOUNG FEATHERHEAD THREW HIS TAIL SAUCILY OVER ONE SHOULDER
8675-295195-0056 WINKED KNOWINGLY AT HIS BROTHERS AND SAID CERTAINLY SIR IF HONESTY CONSISTS IN GETTING WHAT YOU CAN WHILE IT IS GOING I MEAN TO BE HONEST
8675-295195-0057 VERY SOON FEATHERHEAD APPEARED TO HIS ADMIRING COMPANIONS IN THE HEIGHT OF PROSPERITY HE HAD A SPLENDID HOLE IN THE MIDST OF A HEAP OF CHESTNUTS AND HE LITERALLY SEEMED TO BE ROLLING IN WEALTH
8675-295195-0058 HE NEVER CAME HOME WITHOUT SHOWERING LAVISH GIFTS ON HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS HE WORE HIS TAIL OVER HIS BACK WITH A BUCKISH AIR AND PATRONIZED TIP CHIPMUNK WITH A GRACIOUS NOD WHENEVER HE MET HIM
8675-295195-0059 AND THOUGHT THAT THE WORLD WAS GOING WELL WITH HIM BUT ONE LUCKLESS DAY AS FEATHERHEAD WAS LOLLING IN HIS HOLE UP CAME TWO BOYS WITH THE FRISKIEST WIRIEST SCOTCH TERRIER YOU EVER SAW
8675-295195-0060 HIS EYES BLAZED LIKE TORCHES AND POOR FEATHERHEAD'S HEART DIED WITHIN HIM AS HE HEARD THE BOYS SAY NOW WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN'T CATCH THE RASCAL THAT EATS OUR GRAIN
8675-295195-0061 FEATHERHEAD TRIED TO SLINK OUT AT THE HOLE HE HAD GNAWED TO COME IN BY BUT FOUND IT STOPPED
8675-295195-0062 WELL YOU DON'T GET OUT AND NOW FOR A CHASE AND SURE ENOUGH POOR FEATHERHEAD RAN DISTRACTED WITH TERROR UP AND DOWN THROUGH THE BUNDLES OF HAY BETWEEN BARRELS AND OVER CASKS
8675-295195-0063 BUT WITH THE BARKING TERRIER EVER AT HIS HEELS AND THE BOYS RUNNING SHOUTING AND CHEERING HIS PURSUER ON HE WAS GLAD AT LAST TO ESCAPE THROUGH A CRACK THOUGH HE LEFT HALF OF HIS FINE BRUSH BEHIND HIM FOR MASTER WASP THE TERRIER
8675-295195-0064 AND THEY WOULD HAVE CAUGHT HIM AFTER ALL IF TIP CHIPMUNK'S HOLE HAD NOT STOOD HOSPITABLY OPEN TO RECEIVE HIM TIP TOOK HIM IN LIKE A GOOD NATURED FELLOW AS HE WAS AND TOOK THE BEST OF CARE OF HIM
8675-295195-0065 BUT THE GLORY OF FEATHERHEAD'S TAIL HAD DEPARTED FOR EVER HE HAD SPRAINED HIS LEFT PAW AND GOT A CHRONIC RHEUMATISM AND THE FRIGHT AND FATIGUE WHICH HE HAD GONE THROUGH HAD BROKEN UP HIS CONSTITUTION
8675-295195-0066 SO THAT HE NEVER AGAIN COULD BE WHAT HE HAD BEEN BUT TIP GAVE HIM A SITUATION AS UNDER CLERK IN HIS ESTABLISHMENT
