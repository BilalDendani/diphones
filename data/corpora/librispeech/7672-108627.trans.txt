7672-108627-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
7672-108627-0001 WE NOW SAW SEVERAL LARGE ICE ISLANDS AND A FLOE OF FIELD ICE NOT HOWEVER OF ANY GREAT EXTENT THE WINDS GENERALLY BLEW FROM THE SOUTHEAST OR THE NORTHEAST BUT WERE VERY LIGHT
7672-108627-0002 WHENEVER WE HAD A WESTERLY WIND WHICH WAS SELDOM IT WAS INVARIABLY ATTENDED WITH A RAIN SQUALL EVERY DAY WE HAD MORE OR LESS SNOW THE THERMOMETER ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH STOOD AT THIRTY FIVE
7672-108627-0003 THIS DAY WE FOUND OURSELVES COMPLETELY HEMMED IN BY THE ICE AND OUR PROSPECTS LOOKED CHEERLESS INDEED
7672-108627-0004 THAT WE ALL TREMBLED FOR THE CONSEQUENCES TOWARD EVENING THE GALE STILL BLOWING WITH FURY A LARGE FIELD IN FRONT SEPARATED AND WE WERE ENABLED BY CARRYING A PRESS OF SAIL
7672-108627-0005 HAVING CROSSED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE VERY LITTLE ICE WAS TO BE SEEN TO THE SOUTHWARD ALTHOUGH LARGE FIELDS OF IT LAY BEHIND US THIS DAY WE RIGGED SOME SOUNDING GEAR
7672-108627-0006 USING A LARGE IRON POT CAPABLE OF HOLDING TWENTY GALLONS AND A LINE OF TWO HUNDRED FATHOMS WE FOUND THE CURRENT SETTING TO THE NORTH ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE PER HOUR THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS NOW ABOUT THIRTY THREE HERE
7672-108627-0007 WE HAD STILL HELD ON TO THE SOUTHWARD WITHOUT ANY VERY GREAT IMPEDIMENTS ON THIS MORNING HOWEVER
7672-108627-0008 WE SAW NEVERTHELESS MUCH OPEN WATER TO THE SOUTHWARD AND FELT NO DOUBT OF BEING ABLE TO REACH IT EVENTUALLY
7672-108627-0009 WE AT LENGTH CAME TO A PASSAGE OF ABOUT A MILE IN WIDTH
7672-108627-0010 HAIL SQUALLS OF GREAT VIOLENCE IMMENSE FLOCKS OF THE ALBATROSS FLEW OVER THE SCHOONER THIS DAY GOING FROM SOUTHEAST TO NORTHWEST
7672-108627-0011 THE SEA STILL REMAINED PRETTY WELL OPEN
7672-108627-0012 TO THE WESTWARD WE SAW SOME ICEBERGS OF INCREDIBLE SIZE AND IN THE AFTERNOON
7672-108627-0013 ITS GIRTH WAS PROBABLY AT THE BASE THREE QUARTERS OF A LEAGUE AND SEVERAL STREAMS OF WATER WERE RUNNING FROM CREVICES IN ITS SIDES WE REMAINED IN SIGHT OF THIS ISLAND TWO DAYS AND THEN ONLY LOST IT IN A FOG
7672-108627-0014 EARLY THIS MORNING WE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO LOSE A MAN OVERBOARD HE WAS AN AMERICAN NAMED PETER VREDENBURGH A NATIVE OF NEW YORK AND WAS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE HANDS ON BOARD THE SCHOONER
7672-108627-0015 IN GOING OVER THE BOWS HIS FOOT SLIPPED AND HE FELL BETWEEN TWO CAKES OF ICE NEVER RISING AGAIN AT NOON OF THIS DAY WE WERE IN LATITUDE
7672-108627-0016 THE COLD WAS NOW EXCESSIVE AND WE HAD HAIL SQUALLS CONTINUALLY FROM THE NORTHWARD AND EASTWARD IN THIS DIRECTION ALSO WE SAW SEVERAL MORE IMMENSE ICEBERGS
7672-108627-0017 AND THE WHOLE HORIZON TO THE EASTWARD APPEARED TO BE BLOCKED UP WITH FIELD ICE RISING IN TIERS ONE MASS ABOVE THE OTHER SOME DRIFTWOOD FLOATED BY DURING THE EVENING AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF BIRDS FLEW OVER
7672-108627-0018 AMONG WHICH WERE NELLIES PETERELS ALBATROSSES AND A LARGE BIRD OF A BRILLIANT BLUE PLUMAGE
7672-108627-0019 OUR PASSAGE TO THE SOUTH AGAIN LOOKED DOUBTFUL AS NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE POLE
7672-108627-0020 BACKED BY ABSOLUTE MOUNTAINS OF RAGGED ICE ONE PRECIPICE OF WHICH AROSE FROWNINGLY ABOVE THE OTHER
7672-108627-0021 THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS FORTY SEVEN THAT OF THE WATER THIRTYFOUR WE NOW SAILED TO THE SOUTHWARD WITHOUT MEETING ANY INTERRUPTION OF MOMENT UNTIL THE SIXTEENTH
7672-108627-0022 LONGITUDE FORTY TWO DEGREES
7672-108627-0023 WE HERE AGAIN SOUNDED AND FOUND A CURRENT SETTING STILL SOUTHWARDLY AND AT THE RATE OF THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE PER HOUR THE VARIATION PER AZIMUTH HAD DIMINISHED AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS MILD AND PLEASANT
7672-108627-0024 THE THERMOMETER BEING AS HIGH AS FIFTY ONE AT THIS PERIOD NOT A PARTICLE OF ICE WAS TO BE DISCOVERED ALL HANDS ON BOARD NOW FELT CERTAIN OF ATTAINING THE POLE
7672-108627-0025 ABOUT MIDDAY A SMALL FLOE OF ICE WAS SEEN FROM THE MASTHEAD OFF THE LARBOARD BOW AND UPON IT THERE APPEARED TO BE SOME LARGE ANIMAL AS THE WEATHER WAS GOOD AND NEARLY CALM
7672-108627-0026 CAPTAIN GUY ORDERED OUT TWO OF THE BOATS TO SEE WHAT IT WAS DIRK PETERS AND MYSELF ACCOMPANIED THE MATE IN THE LARGER BOAT UPON COMING UP WITH THE FLOE
7672-108627-0027 SEVERAL SHOTS WERE FIRED IN QUICK SUCCESSION THE MOST OF WHICH TOOK EFFECT APPARENTLY IN THE HEAD AND BODY NOTHING DISCOURAGED HOWEVER THE MONSTER THREW HIMSELF FROM THE ICE
7672-108627-0028 AND THE BEAR HAD ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HALF HIS VAST BULK ACROSS OUR GUNWALE AND SEIZING ONE OF THE MEN BY THE SMALL OF HIS BACK BEFORE ANY EFFICIENT MEANS WERE TAKEN TO REPEL HIM
7672-108627-0029 THE BRUTE TUMBLED INTO THE SEA LIFELESS AND WITHOUT A STRUGGLE ROLLING OVER PETERS AS HE FELL THE LATTER SOON RECOVERED HIMSELF AND A ROPE BEING THROWN HIM HE SECURED THE CARCASS BEFORE ENTERING THE BOAT
7672-108627-0030 WE THEN RETURNED IN TRIUMPH TO THE SCHOONER TOWING OUR TROPHY BEHIND US THIS BEAR UPON ADMEASUREMENT PROVED TO BE FULL FIFTEEN FEET IN HIS GREATEST LENGTH
7672-108627-0031 HIS WOOL WAS PERFECTLY WHITE AND VERY COARSE CURLING TIGHTLY THE EYES WERE OF A BLOOD RED AND LARGER THAN THOSE OF THE ARCTIC BEAR THE SNOUT ALSO MORE ROUNDED RATHER RESEMBLING THE SNOUT OF THE BULLDOG
7672-108627-0032 THE MEAT WAS TENDER BUT EXCESSIVELY RANK AND FISHY ALTHOUGH THE MEN DEVOURED IT WITH AVIDITY AND DECLARED IT EXCELLENT EATING
7672-108627-0033 SCARCELY HAD WE GOT OUR PRIZE ALONGSIDE WHEN THE MAN AT THE MASTHEAD GAVE THE JOYFUL SHOUT OF LAND ON THE STARBOARD BOW ALL HANDS WERE NOW UPON THE ALERT AND A BREEZE SPRINGING UP VERY OPPORTUNELY FROM THE NORTHWARD AND EASTWARD
7672-108627-0034 IN APPROACHING IT FROM THE NORTHWARD A SINGULAR LEDGE OF ROCK IS SEEN PROJECTING INTO THE SEA AND BEARING A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO CORDED BALES OF COTTON AROUND THIS LEDGE TO THE WESTWARD IS A SMALL BAY
7672-108627-0035 AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH OUR BOATS EFFECTED A CONVENIENT LANDING IT DID NOT TAKE US LONG TO EXPLORE EVERY PORTION OF THE ISLAND BUT WITH ONE EXCEPTION WE FOUND NOTHING WORTHY OF OUR OBSERVATION IN THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY
7672-108627-0036 WE PICKED UP NEAR THE SHORE HALF BURIED IN A PILE OF LOOSE STONES A PIECE OF WOOD WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE FORMED THE PROW OF A CANOE THERE HAD BEEN EVIDENTLY SOME ATTEMPT AT CARVING UPON IT
7672-108627-0037 AND CAPTAIN GUY FANCIED THAT HE MADE OUT THE FIGURE OF A TORTOISE BUT THE RESEMBLANCE DID NOT STRIKE ME VERY FORCIBLY BESIDES THIS PROW IF SUCH IT WERE WE FOUND NO OTHER TOKEN THAT ANY LIVING CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN HERE BEFORE
7672-108627-0038 UNIFORMLY DECREASED AS WE PROCEEDED AND WHAT WAS STILL MORE SURPRISING THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR AND LATTERLY OF THE WATER BECAME MILDER THE WEATHER MIGHT EVEN BE CALLED PLEASANT
7672-108627-0039 AND WE HAD A STEADY BUT VERY GENTLE BREEZE ALWAYS FROM SOME NORTHERN POINT OF THE COMPASS THE SKY WAS USUALLY CLEAR WITH NOW AND THEN A SLIGHT APPEARANCE OF THIN VAPOUR IN THE SOUTHERN HORIZON THIS HOWEVER WAS INVARIABLY OF BRIEF DURATION
7672-108627-0040 THE NECESSITY OF RETURNING AND HE SPOKE OF IT FREQUENTLY FOR MY OWN PART CONFIDENT AS I WAS OF SOON ARRIVING AT LAND OF SOME DESCRIPTION UPON THE COURSE WE WERE PURSUING AND HAVING EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE FROM PRESENT APPEARANCES
7672-108627-0041 SO TEMPTING AN OPPORTUNITY OF SOLVING THE GREAT PROBLEM IN REGARD TO AN ANTARCTIC CONTINENT HAD NEVER YET BEEN AFFORDED TO MAN AND I CONFESS THAT I FELT MYSELF BURSTING WITH INDIGNATION
7672-108627-0042 AT THE TIMID AND ILL TIMED SUGGESTIONS OF OUR COMMANDER I BELIEVE INDEED THAT WHAT I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING TO HIM ON THIS HEAD HAD THE EFFECT OF INDUCING HIM TO PUSH ON WHILE THEREFORE I
7672-108627-0043 I MUST STILL BE ALLOWED TO FEEL SOME DEGREE OF GRATIFICATION AT HAVING BEEN INSTRUMENTAL HOWEVER REMOTELY
