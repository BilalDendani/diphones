4703-73029-0000 FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR LADY CLAVERING SAT ALONE LISTENING WITH EAGER EAR FOR THE SOUND OF HER HUSBAND'S WHEELS AND AT LAST SHE HAD ALMOST TOLD HERSELF THAT THE HOUR FOR HIS COMING HAD GONE BY
4703-73029-0001 WHEN SHE HEARD THE RAPID GRATING ON THE GRAVEL AS THE DOG CART WAS DRIVEN UP TO THE DOOR
4703-73029-0002 BUT HER HEART SANK WITHIN HER AS SHE DID SO AND SHE TOOK TIGHTLY HOLD OF THE BALUSTRADE TO SUPPORT HERSELF FOR A MOMENT SHE HAD THOUGHT OF RUNNING DOWN TO MEET HIM OF TRUSTING TO THE SADNESS OF THE MOMENT TO PRODUCE IN HIM IF IT WERE BUT FOR A MINUTE
4703-73029-0003 SOMETHING OF TENDER SOLICITUDE BUT SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE SERVANTS WOULD BE THERE AND KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SOFT BEFORE THEM SHE REMEMBERED ALSO THAT THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD RECEIVED HER INSTRUCTIONS AND SHE FEARED TO DISARRANGE THE SETTLED PROGRAMME
4703-73029-0004 SO SHE WENT BACK TO THE OPEN DOOR OF THE ROOM THAT HER RETREATING STEP MIGHT NOT BE HEARD BY HIM AS HE SHOULD COME UP TO HER AND STANDING THERE SHE STILL LISTENED THE HOUSE WAS SILENT AND HER EARS WERE ACUTE WITH SORROW
4703-73029-0005 SHE COULD HEAR THE MOVEMENT OF THE OLD WOMAN AS SHE GENTLY TREMBLINGLY AS LADY CLAVERING KNEW MADE HER WAY DOWN THE HALL TO MEET HER MASTER SIR HUGH OF COURSE HAD LEARNED HIS CHILD'S FATE ALREADY FROM THE SERVANT WHO HAD MET HIM
4703-73029-0006 BUT IT WAS WELL THAT THE CEREMONY OF SUCH TELLING SHOULD BE PERFORMED SHE FELT THE COLD AIR COME IN FROM THE OPENED FRONT DOOR AND SHE HEARD HER HUSBAND'S HEAVY QUICK STEP AS HE ENTERED THEN SHE HEARD THE MURMUR OF HANNAH'S VOICE
4703-73029-0007 BUT THE FIRST WORD SHE HEARD WAS IN HER HUSBAND'S TONES WHERE IS LADY CLAVERING THEN THE ANSWER WAS GIVEN AND THE WIFE KNOWING THAT HE WAS COMING RETREATED TO HER CHAIR BUT STILL HE DID NOT COME QUITE AT ONCE
4703-73029-0008 HE WAS PULLING OFF HIS COAT AND LAYING ASIDE HIS HAT AND GLOVES THEN CAME UPON HER A FEELING THAT AT SUCH A TIME ANY OTHER HUSBAND AND WIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT ONCE IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS AND AT THE MOMENT SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT THEY HAD LOST
4703-73029-0009 TO HER HER CHILD HAD BEEN ALL AND EVERYTHING TO HIM HE HAD BEEN HIS HEIR AND THE PROP OF HIS HOUSE THE BOY HAD BEEN THE ONLY LINK THAT HAD STILL BOUND THEM TOGETHER NOW HE WAS GONE AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY LINK BETWEEN THEM
4703-73029-0010 HE WAS GONE AND SHE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO HER HE WAS GONE AND THE FATHER WAS SO ALONE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY HEIR AND WITH NO PROP TO HIS HOUSE SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THIS AS SHE HEARD HIS STEP COMING SLOWLY UP THE STAIRS
4703-73029-0011 SLOWLY HE CAME ALONG THE PASSAGE AND THOUGH SHE DREADED HIS COMING IT ALMOST SEEMED AS THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER BE THERE WHEN HE HAD ENTERED THE ROOM SHE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK OH HUGH SHE EXCLAIMED OH HUGH
4703-73029-0012 THERE WERE CANDLES NEAR TO HIM AND SHE COULD SEE THAT HIS COUNTENANCE ALSO WAS ALTERED HE HAD INDEED BEEN STRICKEN HARD AND HIS HALF STUNNED FACE SHOWED THE VIOLENCE OF THE BLOW THE HARSH CRUEL SELFISH MAN HAD AT LAST BEEN MADE TO SUFFER
4703-73029-0013 ALTHOUGH HE HAD SPOKEN OF IT AND HAD EXPECTED IT THE DEATH OF HIS HEIR HIT HIM HARD AS THE RECTOR HAD SAID WHEN DID HE DIE ASKED THE FATHER IT WAS PAST FOUR I THINK THEN THERE WAS AGAIN SILENCE
4703-73029-0014 AND LADY CLAVERING WENT UP TO HER HUSBAND AND STOOD CLOSE BY HIS SHOULDER AT LAST SHE VENTURED TO PUT HER HAND UPON HIM WITH ALL HER OWN MISERY HEAVY UPON HER SHE WAS CHIEFLY THINKING AT THIS MOMENT HOW SHE MIGHT SOOTHE HIM
4703-73029-0015 SHE LAID HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER AND BY DEGREES SHE MOVED IT SOFTLY TO HIS BREAST THEN HE RAISED HIS OWN HAND AND WITH IT MOVED HERS FROM HIS PERSON HE DID IT GENTLY BUT WHAT WAS THE USE OF SUCH NONSENSE AS THAT
4703-73029-0016 THE LORD GIVETH SAID THE WIFE AND THE LORD TAKETH AWAY HEARING THIS SIR HUGH MADE WITH HIS HEAD A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE
4703-73029-0017 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND ALMOST TREMBLING AND SHE REPEATED THE WORDS AS THOUGH THEY WERE A TASK WHICH SHE HAD SET HERSELF THAT'S ALL VERY WELL IN ITS WAY SAID HE BUT WHAT'S THE SPECIAL USE OF IT NOW
4703-73029-0018 I HATE TWADDLE ONE MUST BEAR ONE'S MISFORTUNE AS ONE BEST CAN I DON'T BELIEVE THAT KIND OF THING EVER MAKES IT LIGHTER THEY SAY IT DOES HUGH AH THEY SAY HAVE THEY EVER TRIED
4703-73029-0019 THAT IS AS WELL AT ONE TIME AS ANOTHER BUT IT WON'T GIVE ME BACK MY BOY NO HUGH HE WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN BUT WE MAY THINK THAT HE'S IN HEAVEN IF THAT IS ENOUGH FOR YOU LET IT BE SO

4703-73029-0021 SHE FELT THIS AND UNDERSTOOD THE WANT OF AFFECTION WHICH IT CONVEYED BUT SHE SAID NOTHING OF IT OH HUGH WHAT COULD WE DO IT WAS NOT OUR FAULT WHO IS TALKING OF ANY FAULT I HAVE SAID NOTHING AS TO FAULT
4703-73029-0022 HE WAS ALWAYS POOR AND SICKLY THE CLAVERINGS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN SO STRONG LOOK AT MYSELF AND ARCHIE AND MY SISTERS WELL IT CANNOT BE HELPED THINKING OF IT WILL NOT BRING HIM BACK AGAIN YOU HAD BETTER TELL SOME ONE TO GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT
4703-73029-0023 I CAME AWAY OF COURSE WITHOUT ANY DINNER SHE HERSELF HAD EATEN NOTHING SINCE THE MORNING BUT SHE NEITHER SPOKE NOR THOUGHT OF THAT SHE RANG THE BELL AND GOING OUT INTO THE PASSAGE
4703-73029-0024 GAVE THE SERVANT THE ORDER ON THE STAIRS IT IS NO GOOD MY STAYING HERE HE SAID I WILL GO AND DRESS IT IS THE BEST NOT TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS MUCH THE BEST PEOPLE CALL THAT HEARTLESS OF COURSE BUT THEN PEOPLE ARE FOOLS
4703-73029-0025 IF I WERE TO SIT STILL AND THINK OF IT FOR A WEEK TOGETHER WHAT GOOD COULD I DO BUT HOW NOT TO THINK OF IT THAT IS THE THING WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT I SUPPOSE I WILL DRESS AND THEN GO DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
4703-73029-0026 TELL SAUNDERS TO GET ME A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE YOU WILL BE BETTER ALSO IF YOU WILL TAKE A GLASS OF WINE IT WAS THE FIRST WORD HE HAD SPOKEN WHICH SHOWED ANY CARE FOR HER AND SHE WAS GRATEFUL FOR IT AS HE AROSE TO GO
4703-73029-0027 SHE CAME CLOSE TO HIM AGAIN AND PUT HER HAND VERY GENTLY ON HIS ARM HUGH SHE SAID WILL YOU NOT SEE HIM WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO I THINK YOU WOULD REGRET IT IF YOU WERE TO LET THEM TAKE HIM AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM
4703-73029-0028 HE IS SO PRETTY AS HE LIES IN HIS LITTLE BED I THOUGHT YOU WOULD COME WITH ME TO SEE HIM HE WAS MORE GENTLE WITH HER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND SHE LED HIM AWAY TO THE ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN THEIR OWN AND IN WHICH THE CHILD HAD DIED
4703-73029-0029 WHY HERE HE SAID ALMOST ANGRILY AS HE ENTERED I HAVE HAD HIM HERE WITH ME SINCE YOU WENT HE SHOULD NOT BE HERE NOW HE SAID SHUDDERING I WISH HE HAD BEEN MOVED BEFORE I CAME
4703-73029-0030 I WILL NOT HAVE THIS ROOM ANY MORE REMEMBER THAT SHE LED HIM UP TO THE FOOT OF THE LITTLE COT WHICH STOOD CLOSE BY THE HEAD OF HER OWN BED AND THEN SHE REMOVED A HANDKERCHIEF WHICH LAY UPON THE CHILD'S FACE
4703-73029-0031 OH HUGH OH HUGH SHE SAID AND THROWING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK SHE WEPT VIOLENTLY UPON HIS BREAST FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE DID NOT DISTURB HER BUT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS BOY'S FACE HUGH
4703-73029-0032 HUGH SHE REPEATED WILL YOU NOT BE KIND TO ME DO BE KIND TO ME IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT WE ARE CHILDLESS STILL HE ENDURED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS LONGER HE SPOKE NO WORD TO HER BUT HE LET HER REMAIN THERE WITH HER HEAD UPON HIS BREAST
