7522-69612-0002 AND IT STOOD AT THE CORNER OF TWO STREETS BOTH DINGILY QUIET AND DESTINED NO DOUBT TO BE REBUILT BEFORE LONG IN THE GENERAL REJUVENATION OF MAYFAIR AS THE DUCHESS HAD SAID IT OCCUPIED THE SITE OF WHAT HAD ONCE ABOUT SEVENTEEN FORTY
7522-69612-0003 BEEN THE WESTERLY END OF A MEWS BELONGING TO HOUSES IN CURETON STREET LONG SINCE PULLED DOWN THE SPACE FILLED BY THESE HOUSES WAS NOW OCCUPIED BY ONE GREAT MANSION AND ITS GARDENS THE REST OF THE MEWS HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO THREE STORY HOUSES OF A FAIR SIZE

7522-69612-0005 BUILT PROBABLY AT A DIFFERENT DATE AND FOR SOME SPECIAL FAMILY REASON THE BIG PLANES IN THE CURETON HOUSE GARDENS CAME CLOSE TO IT AND OVERSHADOWED IT ONE SIDE WALL OF THE HOUSE IN FACT FORMED PART OF THE WALL OF THE GARDEN THE DUCHESS FULL OF NERVOUSNESS
7522-69612-0006 RAN UP THE STEPS PUT IN THE KEY HERSELF AND THREW OPEN THE DOOR AN ELDERLY SCOTCHWOMAN THE CARETAKER APPEARED FROM THE BACK AND STOOD WAITING TO SHOW THEM OVER OH JULIE PERHAPS IT'S TOO QUEER AND MUSTY CRIED THE DUCHESS

7522-69612-0018 ONCE I LET HER COME TO GROSVENOR SQUARE AND SPEAK TO THE SERVANTS ABOUT GOING TO CHURCH THE GROOM OF THE CHAMBERS SAID SHE WAS A DEAR OLD LADY AND IF SHE WERE HIS COUSIN HE WOULDN'T MIND HER BEING A BIT TOUCHED MY MAID
7522-69612-0019 SAID SHE HAD NO IDEA POKE BONNETS COULD BE SO SWEET IT MADE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE QUEEN LOOKED LIKE WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG AND NONE OF THEM HAVE EVER BEEN TO CHURCH SINCE THAT I CAN MAKE OUT
7522-69612-0020 ADDED THE DUCHESS SLOWLY SHE HAD SECOND SIGHT SHE SAW HER OLD MOTHER IN THIS ROOM ONCE OR TWICE
7522-69612-0021 GHOSTS TOO SAID JULIE CROSSING HER HANDS BEFORE HER WITH A LITTLE SHIVER THAT COMPLETES IT SIXTY YEARS SAID THE DUCHESS MUSING IT WAS A LONG TIME WASN'T IT TO LIVE IN THIS LITTLE HOUSE AND SCARCELY EVER LEAVE IT
7522-69612-0022 OH SHE HAD QUITE A CIRCLE OF HER OWN FOR MANY YEARS HER FUNNY LITTLE SISTER LIVED HERE TOO AND THERE WAS A TIME FREDDIE SAYS WHEN THERE WAS ALMOST A RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM AND TWO OTHER FAMOUS OLD LADIES WHO LIVED IN BRUTON STREET WHAT WAS THEIR NAME
7522-69612-0023 SAID THE DUCHESS AS SHE CAME TO PERCH ON THE ARM OF JULIE'S CHAIR
7522-69612-0024 AFTER HER LITTLE SISTER DEPARTED THIS LIFE SHE BECAME A VERY SILENT SHRIVELLED THING
7522-69612-0025 AND VERY FEW PEOPLE SAW HER SHE TOOK A FANCY TO ME WHICH WAS ODD WASN'T IT WHEN I'M SUCH A WORLDLING AND SHE LET ME COME IN AND OUT EVERY MORNING SHE READ THE PSALMS AND LESSONS WITH HER OLD MAID WHO WAS JUST HER OWN AGE IN THIS VERY CHAIR
7522-69612-0026 FREDDIE WOULD SLIP ROUND AND READ THEM WITH HER YOU KNOW FREDDIE'S VERY RELIGIOUS AND THEN SHE'D WORK AT FLANNEL PETTICOATS FOR THE POOR OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND TILL LUNCH AFTERWARDS SHE'D GO AND READ THE BIBLE TO PEOPLE IN THE WORKHOUSE OR IN HOSPITAL
7522-69612-0027 WHEN SHE CAME HOME THE BUTLER BROUGHT HER THE TIMES AND SOMETIMES YOU'D FIND HER BY THE FIRE STRAINING HER OLD EYES OVER A LITTLE DANTE
7522-69612-0028 AFTERWARDS HER MAID PLAYED DOMINOES OR SPILLIKINS WITH HER
7522-69612-0029 ONE MORNING THE MAID WENT IN TO WAKE HER AND SHE SAW HER DEAR SHARP NOSE AND CHIN AGAINST THE LIGHT AND HER HANDS LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF HER AND WELL I SUPPOSE SHE'D GONE TO PLAY HYMNS IN HEAVEN DEAR COUSIN MARY JULIE ISN'T IT STRANGE THE KIND OF LIVES SO MANY OF US HAVE TO LEAD
7522-69612-0030 JULIE THE LITTLE DUCHESS LAID HER CHEEK AGAINST HER FRIEND'S DO YOU BELIEVE IN ANOTHER LIFE YOU FORGET I'M A CATHOLIC SAID JULIE SMILING RATHER DOUBTFULLY ARE YOU JULIE I'D FORGOTTEN THE GOOD NUNS AT BRUGES TOOK CARE OF THAT
7522-69612-0031 SOMETIMES THEN YOU'RE NOT A GOOD CATHOLIC JULIE NO
7522-69612-0032 AND THEY WENT RAPIDLY THROUGH IT ALL OF IT WAS STAMPED WITH THE SAME CHARACTER REPRESENTING AS IT WERE THE MEETING POINT BETWEEN AN INHERITED LUXURY AND A PERSONAL ASCETICISM
7522-69612-0033 FOR ALL THE LATTER PART OF HER LIFE SHE HAD BEEN HALF A MYSTIC AND HALF A GREAT LADY SECRETLY HATING THE LUXURY FROM WHICH SHE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO FREE HERSELF DRESSING CEREMONIOUSLY AS THE DUCHESS HAD SAID FOR A SOLITARY DINNER AND ALL THE WHILE GOING IN SORE REMEMBRANCE OF A MASTER WHO HAD NOT WHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD
7522-69612-0034 AT ANY RATE THERE WAS AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF HOUSEHOLD STUFF FOR A SINGLE WOMAN AND HER MAIDS IN THE CHINA CUPBOARD
7522-69612-0035 THE LEEDS AND WEDGEWOOD DESSERT DISHES THAT COUSIN MARY LEICESTER HAD USED FOR HALF A CENTURY
7522-69612-0036 AND THE LINEN GRACIOUS AS THE DOORS OF ANOTHER CUPBOARD WERE OPENED TO HER BUT NOW I REMEMBER
7522-69612-0037 AT THE WORN MONOGRAM IN THE CORNERS OF THE SHEETS AT THE LITTLE BAGS OF LAVENDER AND POT POURRI RANGED ALONG THE SHELVES SUDDENLY JULIE TURNED AWAY AND SAT DOWN BY AN OPEN WINDOW
7522-69612-0038 WHY SHOULD YOU GET UGLY NEW ONES WHEN YOU CAN USE COUSIN MARY'S
7522-69612-0039 SHE WOULD HAVE HATED ME WITH ALL HER STRENGTH SAID MISS LE BRETON PROBABLY WITH MUCH TRUTH THE TWO WERE SILENT A LITTLE THROUGH JULIE'S STORMY HEART THERE SWEPT LONGINGS AND BITTERNESSES INEXPRESSIBLE WHAT DID SHE CARE FOR THE LITTLE HOUSE AND ALL ITS LUXURIES
7522-69612-0040 NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND NO LETTER NOT A WORD JULIE SAID THE DUCHESS SOFTLY IN HER EAR YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T LIVE HERE ALONE I'M AFRAID FREDDIE WOULD MAKE A FUSS I'VE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID JULIE WEARILY BUT SHALL WE REALLY GO ON WITH IT EVELYN
7522-69612-0041 THE DUCHESS LOOKED ENTREATY JULIE REPENTED AND DRAWING HER FRIEND TOWARDS HER RESTED HER HEAD AGAINST THE CHINCHILLA CLOAK I'M TIRED I SUPPOSE SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE DON'T THINK ME AN UNGRATEFUL WRETCH WELL THERE'S MY FOSTER SISTER AND HER CHILD
7522-69612-0042 WHAT A WORD TO APPLY TO ANYBODY OR ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH LAST NIGHT ARE YOU VERY SORE JULIE WELL ON THIS VERY DAY OF BEING TURNED OUT IT HURTS I WONDER WHO IS WRITING LADY HENRY'S LETTERS FOR HER THIS AFTERNOON
7522-69612-0043 I HOPE THEY ARE NOT GETTING WRITTEN SAID THE DUCHESS SAVAGELY AND THAT SHE'S MISSING YOU ABOMINABLY
7522-69612-0044 JULIE ROSE AND MADE HER WAY DOWN TO THE DRAWING ROOM AGAIN THE SCOTCHWOMAN SAW THAT SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE AND LEFT HER THE WINDOWS WERE STILL OPEN TO THE GARDEN OUTSIDE JULIE EXAMINED THE PATHS THE SHRUBBERIES THE GREAT PLANE TREES
7522-69612-0045 SHE STRAINED HER EYES TOWARDS THE MANSION ITSELF BUT NOT MUCH OF IT COULD BE SEEN THE LITTLE HOUSE AT THE CORNER HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PLANTED OUT WHAT WEALTH IT IMPLIED THAT SPACE AND SIZE IN LONDON EVIDENTLY THE HOUSE WAS STILL SHUT UP
7522-69612-0046 WHICH THEY WOULD SOON COME UP TO LIVE IN THE CAPITAL HONORS PARKS MONEY BIRTH ALL WERE THEIRS AS NATURALLY AS THE SUN ROSE JULIE ENVIED AND HATED THE BIG HOUSE AND ALL IT STOOD FOR
7522-69612-0047 SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE IN TRUTH TO FREE HERSELF FROM THE AMBITION TO LIVE AND SHINE IN THIS WORLD OF THE ENGLISH RICH AND WELL BORN FOR AFTER ALL AS SHE TOLD HERSELF WITH REBELLIOUS PASSION
7522-69612-0048 IT WAS OR OUGHT TO BE HER WORLD AND YET HER WHOLE BEING WAS SORE FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THESE THREE YEARS WITH LADY HENRY FROM THOSE ABOVE ALL OF THE PRECEDING TWENTY FOUR HOURS SHE WOVE NO ROMANCE ABOUT HERSELF
7522-69612-0049 ANY ONE WHO COULD HAVE COMPELLED THE DISCLOSURE OF HER THOUGHTS
7522-69612-0050 THE PRESENCE IN THIS VERY WORLD WHERE SHE HAD GAINED SO MARKED A PERSONAL SUCCESS OF TWO CLASHING ESTIMATES OF HERSELF BOTH OF WHICH SHE PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD
7522-69612-0051 SHE WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH NOT DESIRABLE ENOUGH TO BE THE WIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED HERE WAS THE PLAIN FACT THAT STUNG AND STUNG
7522-69612-0052 WHAT A PARADOX WAS SHE LIVING IN THE DUCHESS MIGHT WELL ASK WHY INDEED
7522-69612-0053 WHEN UPON THAT WINTER DAY NOW SOME SIX WEEKS PAST WHICH HAD BEHELD LADY HENRY MORE THAN COMMONLY TYRANNICAL AND HER COMPANION MORE THAN COMMONLY WEARY AND REBELLIOUS DELAFIELD'S STAMMERED WORDS AS HE AND SHE WERE CROSSING GROSVENOR SQUARE IN THE JANUARY DUSK
7522-69612-0054 HAD STRUCK FOR THE SECOND TIME UPON HER EAR SHE WAS ALREADY UNDER WARKWORTH'S CHARM BUT BEFORE THE FIRST TIME
7522-69612-0055 THE WILD STRENGTH IN HER OWN NATURE HAD DIVINED AND SHRUNK FROM A SIMILAR STRENGTH IN DELAFIELD'S HERE INDEED ONE CAME UPON THE FACT WHICH FOREVER DIFFERENTIATED HER FROM THE ADVENTURESS HAD SIR WILFRID KNOWN SHE WANTED MONEY AND NAME THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE HUNGERED FOR THEM
7522-69612-0056 BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE TOO RECKLESS A PRICE FOR THEM SHE WAS A PERSONALITY A SOUL NOT A VULGAR WOMAN NOT MERELY CALLOUS OR GREEDY SHE DREADED TO BE MISERABLE SHE HAD A THIRST FOR HAPPINESS AND THE HEART WAS AFTER ALL STRONGER THAN THE HEAD
7522-69612-0057 JACOB DELAFIELD NO HER BEING CONTRACTED AND SHIVERED AT THE THOUGHT OF HIM
7522-69612-0058 BUT NOW AS SHE BELIEVED INVINCIBLE A MYSTIC AN ASCETIC
7522-69612-0059 A MAN UNDER WHOSE MODEST OR CARELESS OR SELF MOCKING WAYS SHE WITH HER EYE FOR CHARACTER DIVINED THE MOST CRITICAL INSTINCTS AND A VERACITY IRON SCARCELY HUMAN A MAN BEFORE WHOM ONE MUST BE ALWAYS POSING AT ONE'S BEST
7522-69612-0060 UNLESS INDEED IF IT CAME TO THIS THAT ONE MUST THINK NO MORE OF LOVE BUT ONLY OF POWER WHY THEN A RING AT THE DOOR RESOUNDING THROUGH THE QUIET SIDE STREET
7522-69612-0061 JULIE TOOK THE LETTER IN ASTONISHMENT
7522-69612-0062 I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM SAID THE SCOTCHWOMAN SHAKING HER HEAD
7522-69612-0063 THE GROOM OF THE CHAMBERS MISINTERPRETING THE MAN'S QUEER ENGLISH AND THINKING THE MATTER URGENT THE NOTE WAS MARKED IMMEDIATE HAD SENT HIM AFTER THE LADIES TO HERIBERT STREET

7522-69612-0066 SEEING LADY HENRY IN EVERY LAMP POST GOT A FEW CLANDESTINE WORDS WITH HUTTON AND KNEW AT LEAST WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO YOU OUTWARDLY AND VISIBLY LAST NIGHT DID YOU THINK ME A POLTROON TO VANISH AS I DID IT WAS THE IMPULSE OF A MOMENT
7522-69612-0067 MISTER MONTRESOR HAD PULLED ME INTO A CORNER OF THE ROOM AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE PARTY NOMINALLY TO LOOK AT A PICTURE REALLY THAT I MIGHT ANSWER A CONFIDENTIAL QUESTION HE HAD JUST PUT TO ME WITH REGARD TO A DISPUTED INCIDENT IN THE AFRIDI CAMPAIGN
7522-69612-0068 WE WERE IN THE DARK AND PARTLY BEHIND A SCREEN THEN THE DOOR OPENED I CONFESS THE SIGHT OF LADY HENRY PARALYZED ME A GREAT MURDEROUS SIX FOOT AFRIDI THAT
7522-69612-0069 MY NERVES SUDDENLY FAILED ME WHAT RIGHT HAD I IN HER HOUSE AFTER ALL
7522-69612-0070 OF EITHER RELATIONSHIP OR OLD ACQUAINTANCE WITH LADY HENRY COMPARED TO THEM I COULD HAVE DONE NOTHING TO SHIELD YOU WAS IT NOT BEST TO WITHDRAW YET ALL THE WAY HOME I ACCUSED MYSELF BITTERLY NOR DID I FEEL WHEN I REACHED HOME

7522-69612-0073 BUT BEFORE THEN YOU WILL WRITE AS FOR ME I AM FULL OF ALTERNATE HOPES AND FEARS
7522-69612-0074 GENERAL FERGUS AS WE WALKED HOME WAS RATHER SILENT AND BEARISH I COULD NOT FLATTER MYSELF THAT HE HAD ANY FRIENDLY INTENTIONS TOWARDS ME IN HIS MIND BUT MONTRESOR WAS MORE THAN KIND AND GAVE ME SOME FRESH OPPORTUNITIES OF WHICH I WAS VERY GLAD TO AVAIL MYSELF
7522-69612-0075 WELL WE SHALL KNOW SOON YOU TOLD ME ONCE THAT IF OR WHEN THIS HAPPENED YOU WOULD TURN TO YOUR PEN AND THAT

7522-69612-0080 YES THE WHOLE HAD CHARACTER AND A KIND OF CHARM THE LITTLE PLACE WOULD MAKE NO DOUBT AN INTERESTING AND DISTINGUISHED BACKGROUND FOR THE LIFE SHE MEANT TO PUT INTO IT SHE WOULD MOVE IN AT ONCE IN THREE DAYS AT MOST
7522-69612-0081 WAYS AND MEANS WERE FOR THE MOMENT NOT DIFFICULT DURING HER LIFE WITH LADY HENRY SHE HAD SAVED THE WHOLE OF HER OWN SMALL RENTES THREE HUNDRED POUNDS LAY READY TO HER HAND IN AN INVESTMENT EASILY REALIZED AND SHE WOULD BEGIN TO EARN AT ONCE
7522-69612-0082 THAT SHOULD BE HER ROOM THE CHEERFUL BLUE PAPERED ROOM WITH THE SOUTH WINDOW JULIE FELT A STRANGE RUSH OF FEELING AS SHE THOUGHT OF IT HOW CURIOUS THAT THESE TWO
7522-69612-0083 SHOULD BE THUS BROUGHT BACK INTO HER LIFE FOR SHE HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THEY WOULD ACCEPT WITH EAGERNESS WHAT SHE HAD TO OFFER HER FOSTER SISTER HAD MARRIED A SCHOOL MASTER IN ONE OF THE COMMUNAL SCHOOLS OF BRUGES
