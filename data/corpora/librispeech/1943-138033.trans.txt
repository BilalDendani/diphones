1943-138033-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN WHEREIN IT IS TOLD AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HIS SQUIRE WERE DON QUIXOTE WENT OFF SATISFIED ELATED AND VAIN GLORIOUS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
1943-138033-0001 AT HAVING WON A VICTORY OVER SUCH A VALIANT KNIGHT AS HE FANCIED HIM OF THE MIRRORS TO BE AND ONE FROM WHOSE KNIGHTLY WORD HE EXPECTED TO LEARN WHETHER THE ENCHANTMENT OF HIS LADY STILL CONTINUED
1943-138033-0002 UNDER THE PENALTY OF CEASING TO BE ONE TO RETURN AND RENDER HIM AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER BUT DON QUIXOTE WAS OF ONE MIND HE OF THE MIRRORS OF ANOTHER FOR HE JUST THEN HAD NO THOUGHT OF ANYTHING
1943-138033-0003 BUT FINDING SOME VILLAGE WHERE HE COULD PLASTER HIMSELF AS HAS BEEN SAID ALREADY
1943-138033-0004 RECOMMENDED DON QUIXOTE TO RESUME HIS KNIGHT ERRANTRY WHICH HE HAD LAID ASIDE IT WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING BEEN PREVIOUSLY IN CONCLAVE WITH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER ON THE MEANS TO BE ADOPTED TO INDUCE DON QUIXOTE
1943-138033-0005 TO STAY AT HOME IN PEACE AND QUIET WITHOUT WORRYING HIMSELF WITH HIS ILL STARRED ADVENTURES AT WHICH CONSULTATION IT WAS DECIDED BY THE UNANIMOUS VOTE OF ALL AND ON THE SPECIAL ADVICE OF CARRASCO
1943-138033-0006 THAT DON QUIXOTE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO AS IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTRAIN HIM AND THAT SAMSON SHOULD SALLY FORTH TO MEET HIM AS A KNIGHT ERRANT AND DO BATTLE WITH HIM FOR THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT A CAUSE AND VANQUISH HIM
1943-138033-0007 THAT BEING LOOKED UPON AS AN EASY MATTER AND THAT IT SHOULD BE AGREED AND SETTLED THAT THE VANQUISHED WAS TO BE AT THE MERCY OF THE VICTOR THEN DON QUIXOTE BEING VANQUISHED THE BACHELOR KNIGHT WAS TO COMMAND HIM TO RETURN TO HIS VILLAGE AND HIS HOUSE
1943-138033-0008 AND NOT QUIT IT FOR TWO YEARS OR UNTIL HE RECEIVED FURTHER ORDERS FROM HIM ALL WHICH IT WAS CLEAR DON QUIXOTE WOULD UNHESITATINGLY OBEY RATHER THAN CONTRAVENE OR FAIL TO OBSERVE THE LAWS OF CHIVALRY AND DURING THE PERIOD OF HIS SECLUSION
1943-138033-0009 HE MIGHT PERHAPS FORGET HIS FOLLY OR THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DISCOVERING SOME READY REMEDY FOR HIS MADNESS
1943-138033-0010 OFFERED HIMSELF AS HIS SQUIRE CARRASCO ARMED HIMSELF IN THE FASHION DESCRIBED
1943-138033-0011 FITTED ON OVER HIS OWN NATURAL NOSE THE FALSE MASQUERADE ONE
1943-138033-0012 AND SO THEY FOLLOWED THE SAME ROUTE DON QUIXOTE TOOK AND ALMOST CAME UP WITH HIM IN TIME TO BE PRESENT AT THE ADVENTURE OF THE CART OF DEATH AND FINALLY ENCOUNTERED THEM IN THE GROVE WHERE ALL THAT THE SAGACIOUS READER HAS BEEN READING ABOUT TOOK PLACE
1943-138033-0013 AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY FANCIES OF DON QUIXOTE AND HIS CONVICTION THAT THE BACHELOR WAS NOT THE BACHELOR SENOR BACHELOR WOULD HAVE BEEN INCAPACITATED FOR EVER FROM TAKING HIS DEGREE OF LICENTIATE
1943-138033-0014 ALL THROUGH NOT FINDING NESTS WHERE HE THOUGHT TO FIND BIRDS
1943-138033-0015 ILL THEY HAD SUCCEEDED AND WHAT A SORRY END THEIR EXPEDITION HAD COME TO SAID TO THE BACHELOR SURE ENOUGH SENOR SAMSON CARRASCO WE ARE SERVED RIGHT IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO PLAN AND SET ABOUT AN ENTERPRISE
1943-138033-0016 BUT IT IS OFTEN A DIFFICULT MATTER TO COME WELL OUT OF IT DON QUIXOTE A MADMAN AND WE SANE HE GOES OFF LAUGHING SAFE AND SOUND AND YOU ARE LEFT SORE AND SORRY I'D LIKE TO KNOW NOW WHICH IS THE MADDER HE WHO IS SO BECAUSE HE CANNOT HELP IT
1943-138033-0017 TO WHICH SAMSON REPLIED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SORTS OF MADMEN IS THAT HE WHO IS SO WILL HE NIL HE WILL BE ONE ALWAYS WHILE HE WHO IS SO OF HIS OWN ACCORD CAN LEAVE OFF BEING ONE WHENEVER HE LIKES
1943-138033-0018 I WAS A MADMAN OF MY OWN ACCORD WHEN I VOLUNTEERED TO BECOME YOUR SQUIRE AND OF MY OWN ACCORD I'LL LEAVE OFF BEING ONE AND GO HOME THAT'S YOUR AFFAIR RETURNED SAMSON BUT TO SUPPOSE THAT I AM GOING HOME UNTIL I HAVE GIVEN DON QUIXOTE A THRASHING IS ABSURD
1943-138033-0019 AND IT IS NOT ANY WISH THAT HE MAY RECOVER HIS SENSES THAT WILL MAKE ME HUNT HIM OUT NOW BUT A WISH FOR THE SORE PAIN I AM IN WITH MY RIBS WON'T LET ME ENTERTAIN MORE CHARITABLE THOUGHTS THUS DISCOURSING THE PAIR PROCEEDED UNTIL THEY REACHED A TOWN
1943-138033-0020 WHERE IT WAS THEIR GOOD LUCK TO FIND A BONE SETTER WITH WHOSE HELP THE UNFORTUNATE SAMSON WAS CURED
1943-138033-0021 AND WENT HOME WHILE HE STAYED BEHIND MEDITATING VENGEANCE AND THE HISTORY WILL RETURN TO HIM AGAIN AT THE PROPER TIME SO AS NOT TO OMIT MAKING MERRY WITH DON QUIXOTE NOW CHAPTER SIXTEEN
1943-138033-0022 OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH A DISCREET GENTLEMAN OF LA MANCHA DON QUIXOTE PURSUED HIS JOURNEY IN THE HIGH SPIRITS SATISFACTION
1943-138033-0023 AND SELF COMPLACENCY ALREADY DESCRIBED FANCYING HIMSELF THE MOST VALOROUS KNIGHT ERRANT OF THE AGE IN THE WORLD BECAUSE OF HIS LATE VICTORY ALL THE ADVENTURES THAT COULD BEFALL HIM FROM THAT TIME FORTH HE REGARDED AS ALREADY DONE AND BROUGHT TO A HAPPY ISSUE
1943-138033-0024 HE MADE LIGHT OF ENCHANTMENTS AND ENCHANTERS HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE COUNTLESS DRUBBINGS THAT HAD BEEN ADMINISTERED TO HIM IN THE COURSE OF HIS KNIGHT ERRANTRY NOR OF THE VOLLEY OF STONES THAT HAD LEVELLED HALF HIS TEETH NOR OF THE INGRATITUDE OF THE GALLEY SLAVES
1943-138033-0025 AND THE SHOWER OF STAKES THAT FELL UPON HIM IN SHORT HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT COULD HE DISCOVER ANY MEANS MODE OR WAY OF DISENCHANTING HIS LADY DULCINEA HE WOULD NOT ENVY THE HIGHEST FORTUNE THAT THE MOST FORTUNATE KNIGHT ERRANT OF YORE EVER REACHED OR COULD REACH
1943-138033-0026 HE WAS GOING ALONG ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN THESE FANCIES WHEN SANCHO SAID TO HIM ISN'T IT ODD SENOR THAT I HAVE STILL BEFORE MY EYES THAT MONSTROUS ENORMOUS NOSE OF MY GOSSIP
1943-138033-0027 AND DOST THOU THEN BELIEVE SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE
1943-138033-0028 ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE TOKENS HE GAVE ME ABOUT MY OWN HOUSE WIFE AND CHILDREN NOBODY ELSE BUT HIMSELF COULD HAVE GIVEN ME AND THE FACE ONCE THE NOSE WAS OFF
1943-138033-0029 AND THE SOUND OF THE VOICE WAS JUST THE SAME LET US REASON THE MATTER SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE COME NOW BY WHAT PROCESS OF THINKING CAN IT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO
1943-138033-0030 WOULD COME AS A KNIGHT ERRANT IN ARMS OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE TO FIGHT WITH ME HAVE I EVER BEEN BY ANY CHANCE HIS ENEMY HAVE I EVER GIVEN HIM ANY OCCASION TO OWE ME A GRUDGE AM I HIS RIVAL
1943-138033-0031 OR DOES HE PROFESS ARMS THAT HE SHOULD ENVY THE FAME I HAVE ACQUIRED IN THEM WELL BUT WHAT ARE WE TO SAY SENOR RETURNED SANCHO
1943-138033-0032 AND IF THAT BE ENCHANTMENT AS YOUR WORSHIP SAYS WAS THERE NO OTHER PAIR IN THE WORLD FOR THEM TO TAKE THE LIKENESS OF
1943-138033-0033 IT IS ALL SAID DON QUIXOTE A SCHEME AND PLOT OF THE MALIGNANT MAGICIANS THAT PERSECUTE ME WHO FORESEEING THAT I WAS TO BE VICTORIOUS IN THE CONFLICT ARRANGED THAT THE VANQUISHED KNIGHT SHOULD DISPLAY THE COUNTENANCE OF MY FRIEND THE BACHELOR
1943-138033-0034 IN ORDER THAT THE FRIENDSHIP I BEAR HIM SHOULD INTERPOSE TO STAY THE EDGE OF MY SWORD AND MIGHT OF MY ARM AND TEMPER THE JUST WRATH OF MY HEART SO THAT HE WHO SOUGHT TO TAKE MY LIFE BY FRAUD AND FALSEHOOD SHOULD SAVE HIS OWN
1943-138033-0035 AND TO PROVE IT THOU KNOWEST ALREADY SANCHO BY EXPERIENCE WHICH CANNOT LIE OR DECEIVE HOW EASY IT IS FOR ENCHANTERS TO CHANGE ONE COUNTENANCE INTO ANOTHER TURNING FAIR INTO FOUL AND FOUL INTO FAIR
1943-138033-0036 FOR IT IS NOT TWO DAYS SINCE THOU SAWEST WITH THINE OWN EYES THE BEAUTY AND ELEGANCE OF THE PEERLESS DULCINEA IN ALL ITS PERFECTION AND NATURAL HARMONY
1943-138033-0037 WHILE I SAW HER IN THE REPULSIVE AND MEAN FORM OF A COARSE COUNTRY WENCH WITH CATARACTS IN HER EYES AND A FOUL SMELL IN HER MOUTH AND WHEN THE PERVERSE ENCHANTER VENTURED TO EFFECT SO WICKED A TRANSFORMATION
1943-138033-0038 AND THY GOSSIP IN ORDER TO SNATCH THE GLORY OF VICTORY OUT OF MY GRASP FOR ALL THAT HOWEVER I CONSOLE MYSELF
1943-138033-0039 GOD KNOWS WHAT'S THE TRUTH OF IT ALL SAID SANCHO AND KNOWING AS HE DID THAT THE TRANSFORMATION OF DULCINEA HAD BEEN A DEVICE AND IMPOSITION OF HIS OWN HIS MASTER'S ILLUSIONS WERE NOT SATISFACTORY TO HIM
1943-138033-0040 BUT HE DID NOT LIKE TO REPLY LEST HE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING THAT MIGHT DISCLOSE HIS TRICKERY AS THEY WERE ENGAGED IN THIS CONVERSATION THEY WERE OVERTAKEN BY A MAN WHO WAS FOLLOWING THE SAME ROAD BEHIND THEM MOUNTED ON A VERY HANDSOME FLEA BITTEN MARE
1943-138033-0041 AND DRESSED IN A GABAN OF FINE GREEN CLOTH WITH TAWNY VELVET FACINGS AND A MONTERA OF THE SAME VELVET THE TRAPPINGS OF THE MARE WERE OF THE FIELD AND JINETA FASHION AND OF MULBERRY COLOUR AND GREEN
1943-138033-0042 HE CARRIED A MOORISH CUTLASS HANGING FROM A BROAD GREEN AND GOLD BALDRIC THE BUSKINS WERE OF THE SAME MAKE AS THE BALDRIC THE SPURS WERE NOT GILT BUT LACQUERED GREEN AND SO BRIGHTLY POLISHED THAT MATCHING AS THEY DID THE REST OF HIS APPAREL
1943-138033-0043 THEY LOOKED BETTER THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN OF PURE GOLD WHEN THE TRAVELLER CAME UP WITH THEM HE SALUTED THEM COURTEOUSLY AND SPURRING HIS MARE WAS PASSING THEM WITHOUT STOPPING BUT DON QUIXOTE CALLED OUT TO HIM GALLANT SIR
1943-138033-0044 IF SO BE YOUR WORSHIP IS GOING OUR ROAD AND HAS NO OCCASION FOR SPEED IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE TO ME IF WE WERE TO JOIN COMPANY IN TRUTH REPLIED HE ON THE MARE
1943-138033-0045 I WOULD NOT PASS YOU SO HASTILY BUT FOR FEAR THAT HORSE MIGHT TURN RESTIVE IN THE COMPANY OF MY MARE YOU MAY SAFELY HOLD IN YOUR MARE SENOR SAID SANCHO IN REPLY TO THIS FOR OUR HORSE IS THE MOST VIRTUOUS AND WELL BEHAVED HORSE IN THE WORLD
1943-138033-0046 AND THE ONLY TIME HE MISBEHAVED MY MASTER AND I SUFFERED FOR IT SEVENFOLD I SAY AGAIN YOUR WORSHIP MAY PULL UP IF YOU LIKE FOR IF SHE WAS OFFERED TO HIM BETWEEN TWO PLATES THE HORSE WOULD NOT HANKER AFTER HER THE TRAVELLER DREW REIN
1943-138033-0047 AMAZED AT THE TRIM AND FEATURES OF DON QUIXOTE WHO RODE WITHOUT HIS HELMET WHICH SANCHO CARRIED LIKE A VALISE IN FRONT OF DAPPLE'S PACK SADDLE
1943-138033-0048 AND IF THE MAN IN GREEN EXAMINED DON QUIXOTE CLOSELY STILL MORE CLOSELY DID DON QUIXOTE EXAMINE THE MAN IN GREEN WHO STRUCK HIM AS BEING A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE IN APPEARANCE HE WAS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE
1943-138033-0049 AND AN EXPRESSION BETWEEN GRAVE AND GAY AND HIS DRESS AND ACCOUTREMENTS SHOWED HIM TO BE A MAN OF GOOD CONDITION
1943-138033-0050 DON QUIXOTE SAW VERY PLAINLY THE ATTENTION WITH WHICH THE TRAVELLER WAS REGARDING HIM AND READ HIS CURIOSITY IN HIS ASTONISHMENT AND COURTEOUS AS HE WAS AND READY TO PLEASE EVERYBODY BEFORE THE OTHER COULD ASK HIM ANY QUESTION HE ANTICIPATED HIM BY SAYING
1943-138033-0051 THE APPEARANCE I PRESENT TO YOUR WORSHIP BEING SO STRANGE AND SO OUT OF THE COMMON I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF IT FILLED YOU WITH WONDER BUT YOU WILL CEASE TO WONDER WHEN I TELL YOU AS I DO THAT I AM ONE OF THOSE KNIGHTS WHO AS PEOPLE SAY GO SEEKING ADVENTURES
1943-138033-0052 I HAVE LEFT MY HOME I HAVE MORTGAGED MY ESTATE I HAVE GIVEN UP MY COMFORTS AND COMMITTED MYSELF TO THE ARMS OF FORTUNE TO BEAR ME WHITHERSOEVER SHE MAY PLEASE MY DESIRE WAS TO BRING TO LIFE AGAIN KNIGHT ERRANTRY NOW DEAD
1943-138033-0053 AND FOR SOME TIME PAST STUMBLING HERE FALLING THERE NOW COMING DOWN HEADLONG NOW RAISING MYSELF UP AGAIN I HAVE CARRIED OUT A GREAT PORTION OF MY DESIGN
1943-138033-0054 SUCCOURING WIDOWS PROTECTING MAIDENS AND GIVING AID TO WIVES ORPHANS AND MINORS THE PROPER AND NATURAL DUTY OF KNIGHTS ERRANT AND THEREFORE BECAUSE OF MY MANY VALIANT AND CHRISTIAN ACHIEVEMENTS
1943-138033-0055 I HAVE BEEN ALREADY FOUND WORTHY TO MAKE MY WAY IN PRINT TO WELL NIGH ALL OR MOST OF THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH THIRTY THOUSAND VOLUMES OF MY HISTORY HAVE BEEN PRINTED AND IT IS ON THE HIGH ROAD TO BE PRINTED THIRTY THOUSAND THOUSANDS OF TIMES
1943-138033-0056 IF HEAVEN DOES NOT PUT A STOP TO IT IN SHORT TO SUM UP ALL IN A FEW WORDS OR IN A SINGLE ONE I MAY TELL YOU I AM DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA OTHERWISE CALLED THE KNIGHT OF THE RUEFUL COUNTENANCE
1943-138033-0057 FOR THOUGH SELF PRAISE IS DEGRADING I MUST PERFORCE SOUND MY OWN SOMETIMES THAT IS TO SAY WHEN THERE IS NO ONE AT HAND TO DO IT FOR ME
1943-138033-0058 NOR THE SALLOWNESS OF MY COUNTENANCE NOR MY GAUNT LEANNESS WILL HENCEFORTH ASTONISH YOU
1943-138033-0059 WITH THESE WORDS DON QUIXOTE HELD HIS PEACE AND FROM THE TIME HE TOOK TO ANSWER
1943-138033-0060 AFTER A LONG PAUSE HOWEVER HE SAID TO HIM YOU WERE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAW CURIOSITY IN MY AMAZEMENT SIR KNIGHT BUT YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN REMOVING THE ASTONISHMENT I FEEL AT SEEING YOU
1943-138033-0061 IT HAS NOT DONE SO ON THE CONTRARY NOW THAT I KNOW I AM LEFT MORE AMAZED AND ASTONISHED THAN BEFORE WHAT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE KNIGHTS ERRANT IN THE WORLD IN THESE DAYS AND HISTORIES OF REAL CHIVALRY PRINTED
1943-138033-0062 I CANNOT REALISE THE FACT THAT THERE CAN BE ANYONE ON EARTH NOW A DAYS WHO AIDS WIDOWS OR PROTECTS MAIDENS OR DEFENDS WIVES OR SUCCOURS ORPHANS NOR SHOULD I BELIEVE IT HAD I NOT SEEN IT IN YOUR WORSHIP WITH MY OWN EYES BLESSED BE HEAVEN
1943-138033-0063 FOR BY MEANS OF THIS HISTORY OF YOUR NOBLE AND GENUINE CHIVALROUS DEEDS WHICH YOU SAY HAS BEEN PRINTED THE COUNTLESS STORIES OF FICTITIOUS KNIGHTS ERRANT WITH WHICH THE WORLD IS FILLED SO MUCH TO THE INJURY OF MORALITY AND THE PREJUDICE AND DISCREDIT OF GOOD HISTORIES
1943-138033-0064 WILL HAVE BEEN DRIVEN INTO OBLIVION THERE IS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID ON THAT POINT SAID DON QUIXOTE AS TO WHETHER THE HISTORIES OF THE KNIGHTS ERRANT ARE FICTION OR NOT WHY
1943-138033-0065 I DOUBT IT SAID DON QUIXOTE
1943-138033-0066 THOSE WHO REGARD IT AS A MATTER OF CERTAINTY THAT THEY ARE NOT TRUE
1943-138033-0067 AND WAS WAITING HIM TO CONFIRM IT BY SOMETHING FURTHER BUT BEFORE THEY COULD TURN TO ANY NEW SUBJECT DON QUIXOTE BEGGED HIM TO TELL HIM WHO HE WAS SINCE HE HIMSELF HAD RENDERED ACCOUNT OF HIS STATION AND LIFE
1943-138033-0068 TO THIS HE IN THE GREEN GABAN REPLIED I SIR KNIGHT OF THE RUEFUL COUNTENANCE AM A GENTLEMAN BY BIRTH NATIVE OF THE VILLAGE WHERE PLEASE GOD WE ARE GOING TO DINE TODAY I AM MORE THAN FAIRLY WELL OFF AND MY NAME IS DON DIEGO DE MIRANDA
1943-138033-0069 I PASS MY LIFE WITH MY WIFE CHILDREN AND FRIENDS MY PURSUITS ARE HUNTING AND FISHING BUT I KEEP NEITHER HAWKS NOR GREYHOUNDS NOTHING BUT A TAME PARTRIDGE OR A BOLD FERRET OR TWO
1943-138033-0070 SOME IN OUR MOTHER TONGUE SOME LATIN SOME OF THEM HISTORY OTHERS DEVOTIONAL THOSE OF CHIVALRY HAVE NOT AS YET CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF MY DOOR I AM MORE GIVEN TO TURNING OVER THE PROFANE THAN THE DEVOTIONAL SO LONG AS THEY ARE BOOKS OF HONEST ENTERTAINMENT THAT CHARM BY THEIR STYLE
1943-138033-0071 AND ATTRACT AND INTEREST BY THE INVENTION THEY DISPLAY THOUGH OF THESE THERE ARE VERY FEW IN SPAIN SOMETIMES I DINE WITH MY NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND OFTEN INVITE THEM MY ENTERTAINMENTS ARE NEAT AND WELL SERVED WITHOUT STINT OF ANYTHING
1943-138033-0072 I HAVE NO TASTE FOR TATTLE NOR DO I ALLOW TATTLING IN MY PRESENCE I PRY NOT INTO MY NEIGHBOURS LIVES NOR HAVE I LYNX EYES FOR WHAT OTHERS DO I HEAR MASS EVERY DAY I SHARE MY SUBSTANCE WITH THE POOR MAKING NO DISPLAY OF GOOD WORKS
1943-138033-0073 LEST I LET HYPOCRISY AND VAINGLORY THOSE ENEMIES THAT SUBTLY TAKE POSSESSION OF THE MOST WATCHFUL HEART FIND AN ENTRANCE INTO MINE I STRIVE TO MAKE PEACE BETWEEN THOSE WHOM I KNOW TO BE AT VARIANCE I AM THE DEVOTED SERVANT OF OUR LADY
1943-138033-0074 AND MY TRUST IS EVER IN THE INFINITE MERCY OF GOD OUR LORD SANCHO LISTENED WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE GENTLEMAN'S LIFE AND OCCUPATION AND THINKING IT A GOOD AND A HOLY LIFE AND THAT HE WHO LED IT OUGHT TO WORK MIRACLES HE THREW HIMSELF OFF DAPPLE
1943-138033-0075 AND ALMOST WITH TEARS SEEING THIS THE GENTLEMAN ASKED HIM WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT BROTHER WHAT ARE THESE KISSES FOR LET ME KISS SAID SANCHO FOR I THINK YOUR WORSHIP IS THE FIRST SAINT IN THE SADDLE
1943-138033-0076 I AM NO SAINT REPLIED THE GENTLEMAN BUT A GREAT SINNER BUT YOU ARE BROTHER FOR YOU MUST BE A GOOD FELLOW AS YOUR SIMPLICITY SHOWS SANCHO WENT BACK AND REGAINED HIS PACK SADDLE HAVING EXTRACTED A LAUGH FROM HIS MASTER'S PROFOUND MELANCHOLY
1943-138033-0077 AND EXCITED FRESH AMAZEMENT IN DON DIEGO DON QUIXOTE THEN ASKED HIM HOW MANY CHILDREN HE HAD AND OBSERVED THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WHEREIN THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS WHO WERE WITHOUT THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD PLACED THE SUMMUM BONUM
1943-138033-0078 WAS IN THE GIFTS OF NATURE IN THOSE OF FORTUNE
1943-138033-0079 I SENOR DON QUIXOTE ANSWERED THE GENTLEMAN HAVE ONE SON WITHOUT WHOM PERHAPS I SHOULD COUNT MYSELF HAPPIER THAN I AM NOT BECAUSE HE IS A BAD SON BUT BECAUSE HE IS NOT SO GOOD AS I COULD WISH HE IS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
1943-138033-0080 HE HAS BEEN FOR SIX AT SALAMANCA STUDYING LATIN AND GREEK AND WHEN I WISHED HIM TO TURN TO THE STUDY OF OTHER SCIENCES I FOUND HIM SO WRAPPED UP IN THAT OF POETRY IF THAT CAN BE CALLED A SCIENCE THAT THERE IS NO GETTING HIM TO TAKE KINDLY TO THE LAW
1943-138033-0081 WHICH I WISHED HIM TO STUDY OR TO THEOLOGY THE QUEEN OF THEM ALL I WOULD LIKE HIM TO BE AN HONOUR TO HIS FAMILY AS WE LIVE IN DAYS WHEN OUR KINGS LIBERALLY REWARD LEARNING THAT IS VIRTUOUS AND WORTHY FOR LEARNING WITHOUT VIRTUE IS A PEARL ON A DUNGHILL
1943-138033-0082 HE SPENDS THE WHOLE DAY IN SETTLING WHETHER HOMER EXPRESSED HIMSELF CORRECTLY OR NOT IN SUCH AND SUCH A LINE OF THE ILIAD WHETHER MARTIAL WAS INDECENT OR NOT IN SUCH AND SUCH AN EPIGRAM
1943-138033-0083 WHETHER SUCH AND SUCH LINES OF VIRGIL ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS WAY OR IN THAT IN SHORT ALL HIS TALK IS OF THE WORKS OF THESE POETS
1943-138033-0084 FOR OF THE MODERNS IN OUR OWN LANGUAGE HE MAKES NO GREAT ACCOUNT BUT WITH ALL HIS SEEMING INDIFFERENCE TO SPANISH POETRY JUST NOW HIS THOUGHTS ARE ABSORBED IN MAKING A GLOSS ON FOUR LINES THAT HAVE BEEN SENT HIM FROM SALAMANCA WHICH I SUSPECT ARE FOR SOME
1943-138033-0085 POETICAL TOURNAMENT TO ALL THIS DON QUIXOTE SAID IN REPLY CHILDREN SENOR ARE PORTIONS OF THEIR PARENTS BOWELS AND THEREFORE BE THEY GOOD OR BAD ARE TO BE LOVED AS WE LOVE THE SOULS THAT GIVE US LIFE
1943-138033-0086 IT IS FOR THE PARENTS TO GUIDE THEM FROM INFANCY IN THE WAYS OF VIRTUE PROPRIETY AND WORTHY CHRISTIAN CONDUCT SO THAT WHEN GROWN UP THEY MAY BE THE STAFF OF THEIR PARENTS OLD AGE AND THE GLORY OF THEIR POSTERITY
1943-138033-0087 AND TO FORCE THEM TO STUDY THIS OR THAT SCIENCE I DO NOT THINK WISE THOUGH IT MAY BE NO HARM TO PERSUADE THEM
1943-138033-0088 AND IT IS THE STUDENT'S GOOD FORTUNE THAT HEAVEN HAS GIVEN HIM PARENTS WHO PROVIDE HIM WITH IT
1943-138033-0089 THEY MAY SEE HIM MOST INCLINED TO AND THOUGH THAT OF POETRY IS LESS USEFUL THAN PLEASURABLE IT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE THAT BRING DISCREDIT UPON THE POSSESSOR POETRY GENTLE SIR IS AS I TAKE IT
1943-138033-0090 LIKE A TENDER YOUNG MAIDEN OF SUPREME BEAUTY TO ARRAY BEDECK AND ADORN WHOM IS THE TASK OF SEVERAL OTHER MAIDENS WHO ARE ALL THE REST OF THE SCIENCES AND SHE MUST AVAIL HERSELF OF THE HELP OF ALL AND ALL DERIVE THEIR LUSTRE FROM HER
1943-138033-0091 BUT THIS MAIDEN WILL NOT BEAR TO BE HANDLED NOR DRAGGED THROUGH THE STREETS NOR EXPOSED EITHER AT THE CORNERS OF THE MARKET PLACES OR IN THE CLOSETS OF PALACES SHE IS THE PRODUCT OF AN ALCHEMY OF SUCH VIRTUE
1943-138033-0092 THAT HE WHO IS ABLE TO PRACTISE IT WILL TURN HER INTO PURE GOLD OF INESTIMABLE WORTH HE THAT POSSESSES HER MUST KEEP HER WITHIN BOUNDS NOT PERMITTING HER TO BREAK OUT IN RIBALD SATIRES OR SOULLESS SONNETS
1943-138033-0093 BE OFFERED FOR SALE UNLESS INDEED IT BE IN HEROIC POEMS MOVING TRAGEDIES OR SPRIGHTLY AND INGENIOUS COMEDIES SHE MUST NOT BE TOUCHED BY THE BUFFOONS NOR BY THE IGNORANT VULGAR INCAPABLE OF COMPREHENDING
1943-138033-0094 OR APPRECIATING HER HIDDEN TREASURES
1943-138033-0095 AND THE LOWER ORDERS FOR EVERYONE WHO IS IGNORANT BE HE LORD OR PRINCE MAY AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED AMONG THE VULGAR HE THEN WHO SHALL EMBRACE AND CULTIVATE POETRY UNDER THE CONDITIONS I HAVE NAMED SHALL BECOME FAMOUS
1943-138033-0096 AND HIS NAME HONOURED THROUGHOUT ALL THE CIVILISED NATIONS OF THE EARTH AND WITH REGARD TO WHAT YOU SAY SENOR OF YOUR SON HAVING NO GREAT OPINION OF SPANISH POETRY I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT HE IS NOT QUITE RIGHT THERE AND FOR THIS REASON
1943-138033-0097 THE GREAT POET HOMER DID NOT WRITE IN LATIN BECAUSE HE WAS A GREEK NOR DID VIRGIL WRITE IN GREEK BECAUSE HE WAS A LATIN IN SHORT ALL THE ANCIENT POETS WROTE IN THE LANGUAGE THEY IMBIBED WITH THEIR MOTHER'S MILK AND NEVER WENT IN QUEST OF FOREIGN ONES TO EXPRESS
1943-138033-0098 THEIR SUBLIME CONCEPTIONS AND THAT BEING SO THE USAGE SHOULD IN JUSTICE EXTEND TO ALL NATIONS AND THE GERMAN POET SHOULD NOT BE UNDERVALUED BECAUSE HE WRITES IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE NOR THE CASTILIAN NOR EVEN THE BISCAYAN
1943-138033-0099 FOR WRITING IN HIS BUT YOUR SON SENOR I SUSPECT IS NOT PREJUDICED AGAINST SPANISH POETRY BUT AGAINST THOSE POETS WHO ARE MERE SPANISH VERSE WRITERS WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER LANGUAGES
1943-138033-0100 OR SCIENCES TO ADORN AND GIVE LIFE AND VIGOUR TO THEIR NATURAL INSPIRATION AND YET EVEN IN THIS HE MAY BE WRONG FOR ACCORDING TO A TRUE BELIEF A POET IS BORN ONE THAT IS TO SAY
1943-138033-0101 THE POET BY NATURE COMES FORTH A POET FROM HIS MOTHER'S WOMB AND FOLLOWING THE BENT THAT HEAVEN HAS BESTOWED UPON HIM WITHOUT THE AID OF STUDY OR ART HE PRODUCES THINGS THAT SHOW HOW TRULY HE SPOKE WHO SAID
1943-138033-0102 AT THE SAME TIME I SAY THAT THE POET BY NATURE WHO CALLS IN ART TO HIS AID WILL BE A FAR BETTER POET AND WILL SURPASS HIM WHO TRIES TO BE ONE RELYING UPON HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ART ALONE THE REASON IS
1943-138033-0103 THAT ART DOES NOT SURPASS NATURE BUT ONLY BRINGS IT TO PERFECTION AND THUS NATURE COMBINED WITH ART AND ART WITH NATURE WILL PRODUCE A PERFECT POET TO BRING MY ARGUMENT TO A CLOSE I WOULD SAY THEN GENTLE SIR
1943-138033-0104 LET YOUR SON GO ON AS HIS STAR LEADS HIM FOR BEING SO STUDIOUS AS HE SEEMS TO BE AND HAVING ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY SURMOUNTED THE FIRST STEP OF THE SCIENCES WHICH IS THAT OF THE LANGUAGES WITH THEIR HELP HE WILL BY HIS OWN EXERTIONS
1943-138033-0105 REACH THE SUMMIT OF POLITE LITERATURE WHICH SO WELL BECOMES AN INDEPENDENT GENTLEMAN AND ADORNS HONOURS AND DISTINGUISHES HIM AS MUCH AS THE MITRE DOES THE BISHOP OR THE GOWN THE LEARNED COUNSELLOR
1943-138033-0106 IF YOUR SON WRITE SATIRES REFLECTING ON THE HONOUR OF OTHERS CHIDE AND CORRECT HIM AND TEAR THEM UP BUT IF HE COMPOSE DISCOURSES IN WHICH HE REBUKES VICE IN GENERAL IN THE STYLE OF HORACE AND WITH ELEGANCE LIKE HIS COMMEND HIM
1943-138033-0107 FOR IT IS LEGITIMATE FOR A POET TO WRITE AGAINST ENVY AND LASH THE ENVIOUS IN HIS VERSE AND THE OTHER VICES TOO PROVIDED HE DOES NOT SINGLE OUT INDIVIDUALS THERE ARE HOWEVER POETS WHO FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING SPITEFUL
1943-138033-0108 WOULD RUN THE RISK OF BEING BANISHED TO THE COAST OF PONTUS IF THE POET BE PURE IN HIS MORALS HE WILL BE PURE IN HIS VERSES TOO THE PEN IS THE TONGUE OF THE MIND AND AS THE THOUGHT ENGENDERED THERE SO WILL BE THE THINGS THAT IT WRITES DOWN
1943-138033-0109 AND WHEN KINGS AND PRINCES OBSERVE THIS MARVELLOUS SCIENCE OF POETRY IN WISE VIRTUOUS AND THOUGHTFUL SUBJECTS THEY HONOUR VALUE EXALT THEM AND EVEN CROWN THEM WITH THE LEAVES OF THAT TREE WHICH THE THUNDERBOLT STRIKES NOT
1943-138033-0110 AS IF TO SHOW THAT THEY WHOSE BROWS ARE HONOURED AND ADORNED WITH SUCH A CROWN ARE NOT TO BE ASSAILED BY ANYONE
1943-138033-0111 SO MUCH SO THAT HE BEGAN TO ABANDON THE NOTION HE HAD TAKEN UP ABOUT HIS BEING CRAZY
