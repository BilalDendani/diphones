2246-131710-0000 THE STOCK TICKER THE LETTERS AND FIGURES USED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TAPE SAID A WELL KNOWN BOSTON STOCK SPECULATOR ARE VERY FEW BUT THEY SPELL RUIN IN NINETY NINE MILLION WAYS IT IS NOT TO BE INFERRED HOWEVER
2246-131710-0001 THAT THE MODERN STOCK TICKER HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MAKING OR LOSING OF FORTUNES THERE WERE REGULAR DAILY STOCK MARKET REPORTS IN LONDON NEWSPAPERS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND NEW YORK SOON FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE
2246-131710-0002 AS FAR BACK AS SIXTEEN NINETY TWO HOUGHTON ISSUED IN LONDON A WEEKLY REVIEW OF FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS UPON WHICH MACAULAY BASED THE LIVELY NARRATIVE OF STOCK SPECULATION
2246-131710-0003 IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY GIVEN IN HIS FAMOUS HISTORY THAT WHICH THE UBIQUITOUS STOCK TICKER HAS DONE
2246-131710-0004 SO THAT AT EVERY MINUTE THOUSANDS OF MILES APART BROKERS INVESTORS AND GAMBLERS MAY LEARN THE EXACT CONDITIONS THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH FACILITIES IS TO BE ADMIRED RATHER THAN DEPLORED
2246-131710-0005 NEWS IS VITAL TO WALL STREET AND THERE IS NO LIVING MAN
2246-131710-0006 AS SHOWN BY THE PRICES OF GOVERNMENT BONDS AND GENERAL SECURITIES HAS BEEN TOLD DAILY FOR FORTY YEARS ON THESE NARROW STRIPS OF PAPER TAPE
2246-131710-0007 THROUGH THE TICKERS OF NEW YORK ALONE IT IS TRUE THAT THE RECORD OF THE CHATTERING LITTLE MACHINE MADE IN CABALISTIC ABBREVIATIONS ON THE TAPE CAN DRIVE A MAN SUDDENLY TO THE VERY VERGE OF INSANITY WITH JOY OR DESPAIR
2246-131710-0008 WITH HIS EARLY STOCK PRINTER WHICH HE TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO SELL HE WENT BACK TO BOSTON AND QUITE UNDISMAYED GOT UP A DUPLEX TELEGRAPH TOWARD THE END OF MY STAY IN BOSTON HE SAYS
2246-131710-0009 I OBTAINED A LOAN OF MONEY AMOUNTING TO EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BUILD A PECULIAR KIND OF DUPLEX TELEGRAPH FOR SENDING TWO MESSAGES OVER A SINGLE WIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY
2246-131710-0010 THE APPARATUS WAS BUILT AND I LEFT THE WESTERN UNION EMPLOY AND WENT TO ROCHESTER NEW YORK TO TEST THE APPARATUS ON THE LINES OF THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC TELEGRAPH BETWEEN THAT CITY AND NEW YORK
2246-131710-0011 BUT THE ASSISTANT AT THE OTHER END COULD NOT BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING NOTWITHSTANDING I HAD WRITTEN OUT A VERY MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF JUST WHAT TO DO
2246-131710-0012 THUS HE WHO HAS NEVER SPECULATED IN A STOCK IN HIS LIFE WAS DESTINED TO MAKE THE BEGINNINGS OF HIS OWN FORTUNE BY PROVIDING FOR OTHERS THE APPARATUS THAT SHOULD BRING TO THE EYE ALL OVER A GREAT CITY
2246-131710-0013 HE WAS IN DEBT AND HIS FEW BELONGINGS IN BOOKS AND INSTRUMENTS HAD TO BE LEFT BEHIND HE WAS NOT FAR FROM STARVING MISTER W S MALLORY AN ASSOCIATE OF MANY YEARS QUOTES DIRECTLY FROM HIM ON THIS POINT
2246-131710-0014 TO VISIT THE CITY FIVE OR SIX TIMES WITHIN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT PERIOD
2246-131710-0015 ON ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK TO GET OUR LUNCH BEFORE KEEPING THE APPOINTMENTS WHICH WERE USUALLY MADE FOR TWO O'CLOCK
2246-131710-0016 BUT ONE DAY WHILE EN ROUTE MISTER EDISON SAID I HAVE BEEN TO LUNCH WITH YOU SEVERAL TIMES NOW TO DAY I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO LUNCH WITH ME AND GIVE YOU THE FINEST LUNCH YOU EVER HAD WHEN WE ARRIVED IN HOBOKEN
2246-131710-0017 WE TOOK THE DOWNTOWN FERRY ACROSS THE HUDSON
2246-131710-0018 MISTER EDISON LED THE WAY TO SMITH AND MC NELL'S OPPOSITE WASHINGTON MARKET AND WELL KNOWN TO OLD NEW YORKERS WE WENT INSIDE AND AS SOON AS THE WAITER APPEARED MISTER EDISON ORDERED APPLE DUMPLINGS AND A CUP OF COFFEE FOR HIMSELF
2246-131710-0019 HE CONSUMED HIS SHARE OF THE LUNCH WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE PLEASURE
2246-131710-0020 HE HAD ONLY MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE TRIP AFTER LEAVING THE BOAT HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS OF BREAKFAST BUT HE WAS WITHOUT MONEY TO OBTAIN IT HOWEVER IN PASSING A WHOLESALE TEA HOUSE HE SAW A MAN TASTING TEA
2246-131710-0021 SO HE WENT IN AND ASKED THE TASTER IF HE MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE TEA THIS THE MAN GAVE HIM AND THUS HE OBTAINED HIS FIRST BREAKFAST IN NEW YORK
2246-131710-0022 UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE SHOULD SECURE A POSITION DURING THE DAY HE SUCCEEDED IN LOCATING THIS OPERATOR BUT FOUND THAT HE ALSO WAS OUT OF A JOB
2246-131710-0023 EDISON SAID THAT AS THE RESULT OF THE TIME CONSUMED AND THE EXERCISE IN WALKING WHILE HE FOUND HIS FRIEND HE WAS EXTREMELY HUNGRY
2246-131710-0024 AND WHAT PARTICULAR KIND OF FOOD WOULD BE MOST SATISFYING AND FILLING THE RESULT WAS THAT AT SMITH AND MC NELL'S HE DECIDED ON APPLE DUMPLINGS AND A CUP OF COFFEE
2246-131710-0025 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE WAS AT WORK AND WAS ABLE TO LIVE IN A NORMAL MANNER DURING THE CIVIL WAR WITH ITS ENORMOUS INCREASE IN THE NATIONAL DEBT AND THE VOLUME OF PAPER MONEY GOLD HAD GONE TO A HIGH PREMIUM AND AS EVER
2246-131710-0026 THIS LED TO THE CREATION OF A GOLD ROOM IN WALL STREET WHERE THE PRECIOUS METAL COULD BE DEALT IN
2246-131710-0027 AND THE LONG ROOM DEVOTED TO ONE BUT THE LEADING OBJECT OF SPECULATION THE GOLD ROOM WAS THE VERY FOCUS OF ALL THE FINANCIAL AND GAMBLING ACTIVITY OF THE TIME AND ITS QUOTATIONS GOVERNED TRADE AND COMMERCE
2246-131710-0028 BUT SEEING THEIR INADEQUACY DOCTOR S S LAWS VICE PRESIDENT AND ACTUAL PRESIDING OFFICER OF THE GOLD EXCHANGE DEVISED AND INTRODUCED
2246-131710-0029 THIS EXHIBITED MERELY THE PREVAILING PRICE OF GOLD BUT AS ITS QUOTATIONS CHANGED FROM INSTANT TO INSTANT IT WAS IN A MOST LITERAL SENSE THE CYNOSURE OF NEIGHBORING EYES ONE INDICATOR LOOKED UPON THE GOLD ROOM
2246-131710-0030 THE OTHER OPENED TOWARD THE STREET WITHIN THE EXCHANGE THE FACE COULD EASILY BE SEEN HIGH UP ON THE WEST WALL OF THE ROOM AND THE MACHINE WAS OPERATED
2246-131710-0031 THE OFFICIAL REGISTRAR OF THE GOLD BOARD DOCTOR LAWS WHO AFTERWARD BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI WAS AN INVENTOR OF UNUSUAL ABILITY AND ATTAINMENTS IN HIS EARLY YOUTH HE HAD EARNED HIS LIVELIHOOD IN A TOOL FACTORY
2246-131710-0032 AND APPARENTLY WITH HIS SAVINGS HE WENT TO PRINCETON WHERE HE STUDIED ELECTRICITY UNDER NO LESS A TEACHER THAN THE FAMOUS JOSEPH HENRY AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
2246-131710-0033 WHOSE BUILDINGS PASSED INTO THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
2246-131710-0034 CONTROLLED AT CENTRAL BY TWO CIRCUIT CLOSING KEYS AND WAS A PROTOTYPE OF ALL THE LATER AND MODERN STEP BY STEP PRINTING TELEGRAPHS UPON WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINANCIAL NEWS DEPENDS THE FRACTION DRUM
2246-131710-0035 OF THE INDICATOR COULD BE DRIVEN IN EITHER DIRECTION
2246-131710-0036 AND WAS DIVIDED AND MARKED IN EIGHTHS IT GEARED INTO A UNIT DRUM
2246-131710-0037 FOUR ELECTRICAL PULSATIONS WERE REQUIRED TO MOVE THE DRUM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FRACTIONS THE GENERAL OPERATION WAS SIMPLE AND IN NORMALLY ACTIVE TIMES THE MECHANISM AND THE REGISTRAR WERE EQUAL TO ALL EMERGENCIES BUT IT IS OBVIOUS
2246-131710-0038 AND THE DELAY CONFUSION AND MISTAKES SOON SUGGESTED TO DOCTOR LAWS THE DESIRABILITY OF HAVING A NUMBER OF INDICATORS AT SUCH SCATTERED POINTS OPERATED BY A MASTER TRANSMITTER
2246-131710-0039 AND DISPENSING WITH THE REGIMENTS OF NOISY BOYS HE SECURED THIS PRIVILEGE OF DISTRIBUTION AND RESIGNING FROM THE EXCHANGE DEVOTED HIS EXCLUSIVE ATTENTION TO THE GOLD REPORTING TELEGRAPH WHICH HE PATENTED AND FOR WHICH AT THE END OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
2246-131710-0040 THE DIALS OR WHEELS BEING ARRANGED IN A ROW HORIZONTALLY OVERLAPPING EACH OTHER AS IN MODERN FARE REGISTERS WHICH ARE NOW SEEN ON MOST TROLLEY CARS IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED SUBSCRIBERS
2246-131710-0041 BUT THE VERY SUCCESS OF THIS DEVICE BROUGHT COMPETITION AND IMPROVEMENT MISTER E A CALLAHAN AN INGENIOUS PRINTING TELEGRAPH OPERATOR
2246-131710-0042 AND HIS FORESIGHT AND INVENTIVENESS MADE HIM THE FATHER OF THE TICKER IN CONNECTION WITH WHICH HE WAS THUS LIKE LAWS ONE OF THE FIRST TO GRASP AND EXPLOIT THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE OF THE CENTRAL STATION AS A UNIVERSAL SOURCE OF SUPPLY
2246-131710-0043 THE HUSTLE MADE THIS DOORWAY TO ME A MOST UNDESIRABLE REFUGE FROM AN APRIL SHOWER I WAS SIMPLY WHIRLED INTO THE STREET I NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT MUCH OF THIS NOISE
2246-131710-0044 WHICH WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE EMPLOYMENT OF SKILLED OPERATORS THE CONCEPTION OF THE STOCK TICKER DATES FROM THIS INCIDENT MISTER CALLAHAN'S FIRST IDEA WAS TO DISTRIBUTE GOLD QUOTATIONS AND TO THIS END HE DEVISED AN INDICATOR
2246-131710-0045 IT CONSISTED OF TWO DIALS MOUNTED SEPARATELY EACH REVOLVED BY AN ELECTROMAGNET SO THAT THE DESIRED FIGURES WERE BROUGHT TO AN APERTURE IN THE CASE ENCLOSING THE APPARATUS AS IN THE LAWS SYSTEM
2246-131710-0046 EACH SHAFT WITH ITS DIAL WAS PROVIDED WITH TWO RATCHET WHEELS ONE THE REVERSE OF THE OTHER ONE WAS USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPELLING LEVER
2246-131710-0047 TO FIT INTO THE TEETH OF THE REVERSED RATCHET WHEEL
2246-131710-0048 IT WAS THUS MADE IMPOSSIBLE FOR EITHER DIAL TO GO BY MOMENTUM BEYOND ITS LIMIT LEARNING THAT DOCTOR LAWS WITH THE SKILFUL AID OF F L POPE WAS ALREADY ACTIVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION MISTER CALLAHAN WITH READY WIT
2246-131710-0049 TRANSFORMED HIS INDICATOR INTO A TICKER THAT WOULD MAKE A PRINTED RECORD
2246-131710-0050 TO WHOM THE NOISE WAS THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF THE MECHANISM MISTER CALLAHAN REMOVED THE TWO DIALS AND SUBSTITUTING TYPE WHEELS TURNED THE MOVEMENTS FACE TO FACE SO THAT EACH TYPE WHEEL COULD IMPRINT ITS CHARACTERS UPON A PAPER TAPE IN TWO LINES
2246-131710-0051 OF THESE ONE FURNISHED THE CURRENT FOR THE ALPHABET WHEEL ONE FOR THE FIGURE WHEEL
2246-131710-0052 CALLAHAN MADE THE FURTHER INNOVATION OF INSULATING HIS CIRCUIT WIRES
2246-131710-0053 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ELECTROMAGNETS WERE THE TICKER'S ACTUATING AGENCY THE TICKER APPARATUS WAS PLACED UNDER A NEAT GLASS SHADE AND MOUNTED ON A SHELF TWENTY FIVE INSTRUMENTS WERE ENERGIZED FROM ONE CIRCUIT
2246-131710-0054 AT THE SOUTHERN TIP OF MANHATTAN ISLAND
2246-131710-0055 WHAT HAPPENED NEXT HAS BEEN THE BASIS OF MANY INACCURATE STORIES BUT IS DRAMATIC ENOUGH AS TOLD IN MISTER EDISON'S OWN VERSION ON THE THIRD DAY OF MY ARRIVAL AND WHILE SITTING IN THE OFFICE
2246-131710-0056 THE COMPLICATED GENERAL INSTRUMENT FOR SENDING ON ALL THE LINES AND WHICH MADE A VERY GREAT NOISE SUDDENLY CAME TO A STOP WITH A CRASH WITHIN TWO MINUTES OVER THREE HUNDRED BOYS A BOY FROM EVERY BROKER IN THE STREET
2246-131710-0057 RUSHED UP STAIRS AND CROWDED THE LONG AISLE AND OFFICE THAT HARDLY HAD ROOM FOR ONE HUNDRED ALL YELLING THAT SUCH AND SUCH A BROKER'S WIRE WAS OUT OF ORDER AND TO FIX IT AT ONCE IT WAS PANDEMONIUM
2246-131710-0058 I WENT TO THE INDICATOR AND HAVING STUDIED IT THOROUGHLY KNEW WHERE THE TROUBLE OUGHT TO BE AND FOUND IT
2246-131710-0059 AND STOPPED THE INSTRUMENT BUT IT WAS NOT VERY NOTICEABLE AS I WENT OUT TO TELL THE MAN IN CHARGE WHAT THE MATTER WAS DOCTOR LAWS APPEARED ON THE SCENE THE MOST EXCITED PERSON I HAD SEEN HE DEMANDED OF THE MAN THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE
2246-131710-0060 BUT THE MAN WAS SPEECHLESS I VENTURED TO SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS AND HE SAID FIX IT FIX IT BE QUICK I REMOVED THE SPRING AND SET THE CONTACT WHEELS AT ZERO AND THE LINE
2246-131710-0061 BATTERY AND INSPECTING MEN ALL SCATTERED THROUGH THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT TO SET THE INSTRUMENTS IN ABOUT TWO HOURS THINGS WERE WORKING AGAIN DOCTOR LAWS CAME IN TO ASK MY NAME AND WHAT I WAS DOING I TOLD HIM
2246-131710-0062 HIS OFFICE WAS FILLED WITH STACKS OF BOOKS ALL RELATING TO METAPHYSICS AND KINDRED MATTERS HE ASKED ME A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS AND HIS SYSTEM AND I SHOWED HIM HOW HE COULD SIMPLIFY THINGS GENERALLY
2246-131710-0063 HE THEN REQUESTED THAT I SHOULD CALL NEXT DAY ON ARRIVAL HE STATED AT ONCE THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE WHOLE PLANT AND THAT MY SALARY WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH
2246-131710-0064 THIS WAS SUCH A VIOLENT JUMP FROM ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE THAT IT RATHER PARALYZED ME FOR A WHILE I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO MUCH TO BE LASTING
2246-131710-0065 I KEPT THIS POSITION MADE MANY IMPROVEMENTS DEVISED SEVERAL STOCK TICKERS UNTIL THE GOLD AND STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY CONSOLIDATED WITH THE GOLD INDICATOR COMPANY
2246-131710-0066 THAN THIS WHICH THUS PLACED AN ILL CLAD UNKEMPT HALF STARVED EAGER LAD IN A POSITION OF SUCH RESPONSIBILITY IN DAYS
2246-131710-0067 EDISON BARELY TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD WAS A KEEN OBSERVER OF THE STIRRING EVENTS AROUND HIM WALL STREET IS AT ANY TIME AN INTERESTING STUDY BUT IT WAS NEVER AT A MORE AGITATED AND SENSATIONAL PERIOD OF ITS HISTORY THAN AT THIS TIME
2246-131710-0068 BE SAID TO HAVE PROVIDED HIM WITH OCCUPATION AND WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY THE ATTEMPT OF MISTER JAY GOULD AND HIS ASSOCIATES TO
2246-131710-0069 SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE
2246-131710-0070 AND THUS ASSISTING TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL STRINGENCY IN THE GOLD MARKET THE GOVERNMENT HAD MADE IT A PRACTICE TO RELIEVE THE SITUATION BY SELLING A MILLION OF GOLD EACH MONTH THE METAL WAS THUS RESTORED TO CIRCULATION
2246-131710-0071 IN SOME MANNER PRESIDENT GRANT WAS PERSUADED THAT GENERAL CONDITIONS AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE CROPS WOULD BE HELPED IF THE SALE OF GOLD WERE SUSPENDED FOR A TIME AND THIS PUT INTO EFFECT
2246-131710-0072 HE WENT TO VISIT AN OLD FRIEND IN PENNSYLVANIA REMOTE FROM RAILROADS AND TELEGRAPHS THE GOULD POOL HAD ACQUIRED CONTROL OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GOLD AND DROVE THE PRICE UPWARD RAPIDLY FROM ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR TOWARD THEIR GOAL OF TWO HUNDRED
2246-131710-0073 ON BLACK FRIDAY THEY PURCHASED ANOTHER TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY AND STILL THE PRICE WENT UP THE FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY WERE IN PANIC BUT THE POOL PERSEVERED IN ITS EFFORT TO CORNER GOLD
2246-131710-0074 WITH A PROFIT OF MANY MILLIONS CONTINGENT ON SUCCESS YIELDING TO FRANTIC REQUESTS PRESIDENT GRANT WHO RETURNED TO WASHINGTON CAUSED SECRETARY BOUTWELL OF THE TREASURY TO THROW FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF GOLD INTO THE MARKET
2246-131710-0075 RELIEF WAS INSTANTANEOUS THE CORNER WAS BROKEN BUT THE HARM HAD BEEN DONE EDISON'S REMARKS SHED A VIVID SIDE LIGHT ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY EPISODE ON BLACK FRIDAY HE SAYS WE HAD A VERY EXCITING TIME WITH THE INDICATORS
2246-131710-0076 IT WORKED IN THE SAME WAY AS AN ORDINARY COUNTER ONE WHEEL MADE TEN REVOLUTIONS AND AT THE TENTH IT ADVANCED THE ADJACENT WHEEL AND THIS IN ITS TURN HAVING GONE TEN REVOLUTIONS ADVANCED THE NEXT WHEEL AND SO ON
2246-131710-0077 ON THE MORNING OF BLACK FRIDAY THE INDICATOR WAS QUOTING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PREMIUM
2246-131710-0078 FOR FIVE MILLIONS OR ANY PART WE HAD A PAPER WEIGHT AT THE TRANSMITTER TO SPEED IT UP AND BY ONE O'CLOCK REACHED THE RIGHT QUOTATION THE EXCITEMENT WAS PRODIGIOUS
2246-131710-0079 ONE MAN CAME TO THE BOOTH GRABBED A PENCIL AND ATTEMPTED TO WRITE A MESSAGE TO BOSTON THE FIRST STROKE WENT CLEAR OFF THE BLANK HE WAS SO EXCITED THAT HE HAD THE OPERATOR WRITE THE MESSAGE FOR HIM AMID GREAT EXCITEMENT
2246-131710-0080 SPEYER THE BANKER WENT CRAZY AND IT TOOK FIVE MEN TO HOLD HIM AND EVERYBODY LOST THEIR HEAD THE WESTERN UNION OPERATOR CAME TO ME AND SAID SHAKE EDISON WE ARE O K
2246-131710-0081 I FELT VERY HAPPY BECAUSE WE WERE POOR THESE OCCASIONS ARE VERY ENJOYABLE TO A POOR MAN
2246-131710-0082 THERE IS A CALM SENSE OF DETACHMENT ABOUT THIS DESCRIPTION THAT HAS BEEN POSSESSED BY THE NARRATOR EVEN IN THE MOST ANXIOUS MOMENTS OF HIS CAREER HE WAS DETERMINED TO SEE ALL THAT COULD BE SEEN AND QUITTING HIS PERCH ON THE TELEGRAPH BOOTH
2246-131710-0083 SOUGHT THE MORE SECLUDED HEADQUARTERS OF THE POOL FORCES A FRIEND OF MINE WAS AN OPERATOR WHO WORKED IN THE OFFICE OF BELDEN AND COMPANY SIXTY BROADWAY WHICH WERE HEADQUARTERS FOR FISK MISTER GOULD WAS UP TOWN IN THE ERIE OFFICES IN THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE
2246-131710-0084 WAS THE OTHER BRANCH ALL WERE CONNECTED WITH WIRES GOULD SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE FISK BEING THE EXECUTIVE DOWN TOWN FISK WORE A VELVET CORDUROY COAT AND A VERY PECULIAR VEST HE WAS VERY CHIPPER AND SEEMED TO BE LIGHT HEARTED AND HAPPY
2246-131710-0085 SITTING AROUND THE ROOM WERE ABOUT A DOZEN FINE LOOKING MEN ALL HAD THE COMPLEXION OF CADAVERS THERE WAS A BASKET OF CHAMPAGNE HUNDREDS OF BOYS WERE RUSHING IN PAYING CHECKS ALL CHECKS BEING PAYABLE TO BELDEN AND COMPANY
2246-131710-0086 WHEN JAMES BROWN OF BROWN BROTHERS AND COMPANY BROKE THE CORNER BY SELLING FIVE MILLION GOLD ALL PAYMENTS WERE REPUDIATED BY SMITH GOULD AND MARTIN BUT THEY CONTINUED TO RECEIVE CHECKS AT BELDEN AND COMPANY'S FOR SOME TIME
2246-131710-0087 UNTIL THE STREET GOT WIND OF THE GAME THERE WAS SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY WITH THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE WHICH I COULD NOT MAKE OUT BUT I HEARD MESSAGES THAT OPENED MY EYES AS TO THE RAMIFICATIONS OF WALL STREET
2246-131710-0088 THERE WAS AN OPERATOR NAMED JERRY BORST AT THE OTHER END HE WAS A FIRST CLASS RECEIVER AND RAPID SENDER WE MADE UP A SCHEME TO HOLD THIS WIRE SO HE CHANGED ONE LETTER OF THE ALPHABET
2246-131710-0089 IF ANY OPERATOR TRIED TO RECEIVE FROM BORST HE COULDN'T DO IT SO BORST AND I ALWAYS WORKED TOGETHER BORST DID LESS TALKING THAN ANY OPERATOR I EVER KNEW NEVER HAVING SEEN HIM
2246-131710-0090 I DID ALL THE TALKING HE WOULD LISTEN STROKE HIS BEARD AND SAY NOTHING IN THE EVENING I WENT OVER TO AN ALL NIGHT LUNCH HOUSE IN PRINTING HOUSE SQUARE IN A BASEMENT OLIVER'S NIGHT EDITORS INCLUDING HORACE GREELEY AND HENRY RAYMOND
2246-131710-0091 OF THE NEW YORK TIMES TOOK THEIR MIDNIGHT LUNCH THERE WHEN I WENT WITH BORST AND
2246-131710-0092 THE NIGHT WAS INTENSELY HOT AND CLOSE AFTER GETTING OUR LUNCH AND UPON REACHING THE SIDEWALK BORST OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SAID THAT'S A GREAT PLACE A PLATE OF CAKES A CUP OF COFFEE AND A RUSSIAN BATH FOR TEN CENTS
2246-131710-0093 THIS WAS ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF HIS CONVERSATION FOR TWO DAYS
2246-131710-0094 EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE THIS WAS THE FIRST PROFESSIONAL CARD
2246-131710-0095 AND IS HERE REPRODUCED IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ADVERTISEMENT ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE TELEGRAPHER AND APPEARING FREQUENTLY WAS NOT PAID FOR AT FULL RATES AS THE PUBLISHER MISTER J N ASHLEY BECAME A PARTNER IN THE FIRM
2246-131710-0096 AND NOT ALTOGETHER A SLEEPING ONE WHEN IT CAME TO A DIVISION OF PROFITS WHICH AT TIMES WERE CONSIDERABLE IN ORDER TO BE NEARER HIS NEW FRIEND EDISON BOARDED WITH POPE AT ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY FOR SOME TIME
2246-131710-0097 LIVING THE STRENUOUS LIFE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTIES ASSOCIATED WITH POPE AND ASHLEY HE FOLLOWED UP HIS WORK ON TELEGRAPH PRINTERS WITH MARKED SUCCESS WHILE WITH THEM I DEVISED A PRINTER TO PRINT GOLD QUOTATIONS INSTEAD OF INDICATING THEM
2246-131710-0098 THE LINES WERE STARTED AND THE WHOLE WAS SOLD OUT TO THE GOLD AND STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY
2246-131710-0099 LOCATED NEAR THE STATION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD IN JERSEY CITY EVERY NIGHT I LEFT FOR ELIZABETH ON THE ONE A M TRAIN THEN WALKED HALF A MILE TO MISTER POPE'S HOUSE AND UP AT SIX A M FOR BREAKFAST TO CATCH THE SEVEN A M TRAIN
2246-131710-0100 AND MANY WERE THE OCCASIONS WHEN I WAS NEARLY FROZEN IN THE ELIZABETH WALK THIS DOCTOR BRADLEY APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST IN THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PRECISION WITH THE GALVANOMETER
2246-131710-0101 HE WAS ALSO EXTREMELY IRASCIBLE AND WHEN ON ONE OCCASION THE CONNECTING WIRE WOULD NOT COME OUT OF ONE OF THE BINDING POSTS OF A NEW AND COSTLY GALVANOMETER HE JERKED THE INSTRUMENT TO THE FLOOR AND THEN JUMPED ON IT
2246-131710-0102 HE MUST HAVE BEEN HOWEVER A MAN OF ORIGINALITY AS EVIDENCED BY HIS ATTEMPT TO AGE WHISKEY BY ELECTRICITY
2246-131710-0103 THE HOBBY HE HAD AT THE TIME I WAS THERE SAYS EDISON WAS THE AGING OF RAW WHISKEY BY PASSING STRONG ELECTRIC CURRENTS THROUGH IT HE HAD ARRANGED TWENTY JARS WITH PLATINUM ELECTRODES HELD IN PLACE BY HARD RUBBER
2246-131710-0104 WHEN ALL WAS READY HE FILLED THE CELLS WITH WHISKEY CONNECTED THE BATTERY
2246-131710-0105 HE THEN DISAPPEARED FOR THREE DAYS ON THE SECOND DAY WE NOTICED A TERRIBLE SMELL IN THE SHOP AS IF FROM SOME DEAD ANIMAL THE NEXT DAY THE DOCTOR ARRIVED AND NOTICING THE SMELL ASKED WHAT WAS DEAD WE ALL THOUGHT SOMETHING HAD GOT INTO HIS WHISKEY ROOM AND DIED
2246-131710-0106 HE OPENED IT AND WAS NEARLY OVERCOME THE HARD RUBBER HE USED WAS OF COURSE FULL OF SULPHUR
2246-131710-0107 HAD PRODUCED SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS IN TORRENTS
2246-131710-0108 IN THE ELECTRICAL WORLD OF MARCH FOURTH EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE BY MISTER RALPH W POPE
2246-131710-0109 WHO HAD AS A YOUTH AN ACTIVE AND INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH THAT BRANCH OF ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY IN THE COURSE OF HIS ARTICLE HE MENTIONS THE CURIOUS FACT THAT DOCTOR LAWS AT FIRST IN RECEIVING QUOTATIONS FROM THE EXCHANGES WAS SO DISTRUSTFUL OF THE MORSE SYSTEM
2246-131710-0110 AS TO THE RELATIONS OF THAT TIME MISTER POPE REMARKS THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO CONCERNS RESULTED IN CONSOLIDATION
2246-131710-0111 WHILE THE LAWS STOCK PRINTER WAS RELEGATED TO THE SCRAP HEAP AND THE MUSEUM COMPETITION IN THE FIELD DID NOT HOWEVER CEASE MESSRS POPE AND EDISON INVENTED A ONE WIRE PRINTER
2246-131710-0112 AND STARTED A SYSTEM OF GOLD PRINTERS DEVOTED TO THE RECORDING OF GOLD QUOTATIONS AND STERLING EXCHANGE ONLY
2246-131710-0113 AND STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY WHICH WAS PROBABLY AT THIS TIME AT THE HEIGHT OF ITS PROSPERITY THE FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY WAS PECULIAR AND WORTHY OF ATTENTION EACH SUBSCRIBER FOR A MACHINE PAID IN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
2246-131710-0114 FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SECURING AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE SERVICE HE PAID TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS WEEKLY IN CASE HE RETIRED OR FAILED HE COULD TRANSFER HIS RIGHT AND EMPLOYEES WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE ALERT FOR PURCHASABLE RIGHTS WHICH COULD BE DISPOSED OF AT A PROFIT
2246-131710-0115 A PRIVATE LINE DEPARTMENT WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE BUSINESS TAKEN OVER FROM POPE EDISON AND ASHLEY WAS RAPIDLY ENLARGED AT THIS JUNCTURE GENERAL LEFFERTS AS PRESIDENT OF THE GOLD AND STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY REQUESTED EDISON TO GO TO WORK ON IMPROVING THE STOCK TICKER
2246-131710-0116 FURNISHING THE MONEY AND THE WELL KNOWN UNIVERSAL TICKER IN WIDE SPREAD USE IN ITS DAY WAS ONE RESULT MISTER EDISON GIVES A GRAPHIC PICTURE OF THE STARTLING EFFECT ON HIS FORTUNES I MADE A GREAT MANY INVENTIONS
2246-131710-0117 THIS WAS MADE EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE AS THEY DID NOT HAVE THE EXPERTS WE HAD IN NEW YORK TO HANDLE ANYTHING COMPLICATED THE SAME TICKER WAS USED ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE
2246-131710-0118 AND MUCH TROUBLE TO THE BROKER HE CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE AND SAID NOW YOUNG MAN I WANT TO CLOSE UP THE MATTER OF YOUR INVENTIONS HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD RECEIVE
2246-131710-0119 I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE TIME AND KILLING PACE I WAS WORKING AT I SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
2246-131710-0120 I HADN'T THE NERVE TO NAME SUCH A LARGE SUM SO I SAID
2246-131710-0121 THEN HE SAID HOW WOULD FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS STRIKE YOU THIS CAUSED ME TO COME AS NEAR FAINTING AS I EVER GOT I WAS AFRAID HE WOULD HEAR MY HEART BEAT I MANAGED TO SAY THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR ALL RIGHT I WILL HAVE A CONTRACT DRAWN
2246-131710-0122 COME AROUND IN THREE DAYS AND SIGN IT AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE MONEY I ARRIVED ON TIME BUT HAD BEEN DOING SOME CONSIDERABLE THINKING ON THE SUBJECT THE SUM SEEMED TO BE VERY LARGE FOR THE AMOUNT OF WORK FOR AT THAT TIME I DETERMINED THE VALUE
2246-131710-0123 AND NOT BY WHAT THE INVENTION WAS WORTH TO OTHERS I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING UNREAL ABOUT IT HOWEVER THE CONTRACT WAS HANDED TO ME I SIGNED WITHOUT READING IT
2246-131710-0124 ONE FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS DRAWN ON THE BANK OF NEW YORK AT THE CORNER OF WILLIAM AND WALL STREETS
2246-131710-0125 WHICH IN HIS DEAFNESS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE CHECK WAS HANDED BACK TO HIM AND EDISON FANCYING FOR A MOMENT THAT IN SOME WAY HE HAD BEEN CHEATED WENT OUTSIDE TO THE LARGE STEPS TO LET THE COLD SWEAT EVAPORATE
2246-131710-0126 HE THEN WENT BACK TO THE GENERAL WHO WITH HIS SECRETARY HAD A GOOD LAUGH OVER THE MATTER TOLD HIM THE CHECK MUST BE ENDORSED
2246-131710-0127 THE CEREMONY OF IDENTIFICATION PERFORMED WITH THE PAYING TELLER WHO WAS QUITE MERRY OVER THE INCIDENT EDISON WAS GIVEN THE AMOUNT IN BUNDLES OF SMALL BILLS UNTIL THERE CERTAINLY SEEMED
2246-131710-0128 UNAWARE THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A PRACTICAL JOKE EDISON PROCEEDED GRAVELY TO STOW AWAY THE MONEY IN HIS OVERCOAT POCKETS AND ALL HIS OTHER POCKETS HE THEN WENT TO NEWARK AND SAT UP ALL NIGHT WITH THE MONEY FOR FEAR IT MIGHT BE STOLEN ONCE MORE HE SOUGHT HELP NEXT MORNING
2246-131710-0129 ENABLED HIM TO DEPOSIT THE CURRENCY IN THE BANK AND OPEN AN ACCOUNT THUS IN AN INCONCEIVABLY BRIEF TIME HAD EDISON PASSED FROM POVERTY TO INDEPENDENCE MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION AS TO HIS ORIGINALITY AND ABILITY ON IMPORTANT PEOPLE
2246-131710-0130 ONE OF THE LEADERS AND PIONEERS FOR WHOM THE WORLD IS ALWAYS LOOKING AND TO USE HIS OWN CRITICISM OF HIMSELF HE HAD TOO SANGUINE A TEMPERAMENT
2246-131710-0131 HE SEIZED HIS OPPORTUNITY
2246-131710-0132 NUMBERS TEN AND TWELVE WARD STREET NEWARK NEW JERSEY HE SECURED LARGE ORDERS FROM GENERAL LEFFERTS TO BUILD STOCK TICKERS AND EMPLOYED FIFTY MEN AS BUSINESS INCREASED HE PUT ON A NIGHT FORCE AND WAS HIS OWN FOREMAN ON BOTH SHIFTS
2246-131710-0133 HALF AN HOUR OF SLEEP THREE OR FOUR TIMES IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS WAS ALL HE NEEDED IN THOSE DAYS WHEN ONE INVENTION SUCCEEDED ANOTHER WITH DAZZLING RAPIDITY
2246-131710-0134 GREAT VOLCANO THROWING OUT NEW IDEAS INCESSANTLY WITH SPECTACULAR EFFECT ON THE ARTS TO WHICH THEY RELATED IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A THEORY WITH EDISON
2246-131710-0135 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE NEVER UNTIL LONG PAST FIFTY
2246-131710-0136 OR IN THE USE OF STRONG COFFEE AND BLACK CIGARS HE HAS MOREOVER WHILE OF TENDER AND KINDLY DISPOSITION NEVER HESITATED TO USE MEN UP AS FREELY AS A NAPOLEON OR GRANT SEEING ONLY THE GOAL OF A COMPLETE INVENTION
