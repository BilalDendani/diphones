7764-106805-0000 THE PONY EXPRESS RIDER AT THE TIME WHEN THE CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT CODY WAS TOO YOUNG TO ENLIST NO REGIMENT WOULD TAKE HIM AND BESIDES HIS MOTHER WHO WAS IN FEEBLE HEALTH AND WHO HAD ALL THE FAMILY TO LOOK OUT FOR
7764-106805-0001 BEGGED AND PRAYED HIM TO STAY AT HOME AS SHE SAID IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR HIM THE MAN OF THE FAMILY TO WATCH OVER THEM THAN TO PUT HIS SERVICES AT HIS COUNTRY'S DISPOSAL THE BOY WANTED TO GO
7764-106805-0002 YET HE GAVE UP HIS AMBITION FOR HIS MOTHER BILL PROMISED HIS MOTHER THAT HE WOULD NEVER GO TO WAR AS LONG AS SHE WAS ALIVE BUT THAT AS HE MUST DO SOMETHING TO EARN MONEY HE HAD TO GO TO WORK AT ONCE
7764-106805-0003 HIS CHANCE CAME WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN A GROUP OF MEN WHO WILL BE READ ABOUT AS LONG AS THERE IS ANY HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES THEIR WORK ONLY LASTED A FEW YEARS
7764-106805-0004 BUT IT WAS SO EXTRAORDINARY SO EXCITING SO NEAR TO THE IDEAL OF A LIFE OF ADVENTURE THAT IT STANDS OUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN MANY AN ERA IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY WHICH HAD GREATER RESULTS AND EXTENDED OVER A LONGER TIME
7764-106805-0005 THE FIRM OF RUSSELL MAJORS AND WADDELL WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED INCREASED IN IMPORTANCE BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONLY MEN WHO CARRIED OUT ON A LARGE SCALE SUCCESSFULLY
7764-106805-0006 THE BUSINESS OF TRANSPORTING FREIGHT ACROSS THE DESERT AND THE MOUNTAINS TO CALIFORNIA BUT AS CALIFORNIA GREW AND IT GREW VERY FAST IN A FEW YEARS
7764-106805-0007 THERE CAME A DEMAND FOR A SPEEDIER METHOD OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE WESTERN FRONTIER IN THE EAST AND THE EASTERN FRONTIER IN THE WEST
7764-106805-0008 THOSE TWO THOUSAND MILES OF WASTE LAND CONSUMED A MONTH OR MORE WHEN TRANSPORTATION WAS BY MEANS OF BULL TRAINS IT DID NOT MATTER VERY MUCH WITH FREIGHT BUT IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF MONEY OF LETTERS
7764-106805-0009 OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS THAT TIME GREW TO BE TOO LONG FOR ADVANCING CIVILIZATION THE GREAT FREIGHT TRANSPORTERS THEREFORE CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF GETTING UP A SCHEME FOR CARRYING A FEW LETTERS AT A MUCH FASTER RATE
7764-106805-0010 FROM SAINT JOSEPH TO SAN FRANCISCO BY MEANS OF A SINGLE HORSEMAN RIDING A PONY AT FULL SPEED THEIR IDEA WAS THAT A MAN SHOULD MOUNT A SWIFT PONY WELL TRIED FOR HIS ENDURANCE BEFORE STARTING
7764-106805-0011 THAT THIS MAN SHOULD RIDE FIFTEEN MILES STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE DESERT AND THAT AT THE END OF THE FIFTEEN MILES THERE SHOULD BE A STATION A HOUSE WITH A COUPLE OF MEN IN IT WHO WOULD HAVE ANOTHER PONY READY THE HORSEMAN WAS TO RIDE UP TO THIS SHANTY
7764-106805-0012 JUMP TO THE GROUND WITH HIS BAG OF LETTERS IMMEDIATELY JUMP ON THE FRESH PONY AND RUSH ALONG ANOTHER FIFTEEN MILES TO A SIMILAR STATION SOME OF THESE STATIONS WERE IN SETTLEMENTS SOME WERE IN TOWNS
7764-106805-0013 BUT MOST OF THEM WERE ON THE BLEAK PRAIRIES OR IN THE HILLS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THE TRAIL WAS THE SAME AS THAT USED BY THE FREIGHT BULL TRAINS THE BULL TRAIN STATIONS WERE OF COURSE USED BUT IT WAS NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STATIONS
7764-106805-0014 SOME OF THE DIVISIONS WERE LONGER THAN OTHERS BUT THE AVERAGE WAS A DISTANCE OF FORTY FIVE MILES THAT IS THE MAN WHO RODE ONE OF THESE DIVISIONS OF THE TWO THOUSAND MILES RODE FIFTEEN MILES ON ONE PONY
7764-106805-0015 FIFTEEN MILES ON THE SECOND AND FIFTEEN MILES ON THE THIRD THEN HE BEGAN HIS RETURN TRIP OF FORTY FIVE MILES THE LONGEST DIVISION WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES
7764-106805-0016 SOMETIMES THE COUNTRY WAS OPEN AND MODERATELY EASY FOR RIDING SOMETIMES IT WAS UP ROCKY GULCHES OR THROUGH FORESTS WHERE THE RIDING WAS HARD IT REQUIRED IN THE MEN THE HARDEST KIND OF PHYSIQUE AND ENDURANCE
7764-106805-0017 IN THE PONIES SUREFOOTEDNESS AS WELL AS SWIFTNESS SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO KEEP UP THE SCHEDULE THE MEN WERE OBLIGED TO COVER TWENTY FIVE MILES IN AN HOUR ON FLAT COUNTRY
7764-106805-0018 THEY RECEIVED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH WHICH WAS VERY HIGH PAY BUT THAT GAVE THE PROMOTERS OF THE SCHEME THEIR CHOICE AMONG THE BEST MEN OF THE FRONTIER THE LETTERS WERE CARRIED IN MAIL POUCHES OR BAGS THAT HUNG OVER THE SADDLE
7764-106805-0019 AND NO RIDER WAS ALLOWED TO CARRY MORE THAN TWENTY POUNDS IN ORDER TO GET AS MUCH MAIL WITHIN THE TWENTY POUNDS AS POSSIBLE LETTERS WERE WRITTEN ON TISSUE PAPER WHATEVER MONEY WAS CARRIED WAS IN PAPER
7764-106805-0020 AND ONE EASTERN NEWSPAPER PRINTED A SPECIAL EDITION ON TISSUE PAPER FOR USE ONLY ON THIS FAMOUS PONY EXPRESS SO IN THE TWENTY POUNDS THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF LETTERS IN FACT THE PAPER WAS SO THIN
7764-106805-0021 THAT EVEN A HUNDRED LETTERS WOULD NOT OCCUPY A SPACE LARGER THAN THAT OCCUPIED BY AN ORDINARY MONTHLY MAGAZINE TO DAY THE MAIL POUCHES WERE WATERPROOF AND ONCE LOCKED AT SAINT JOSEPH MISSOURI
7764-106805-0022 THEY WERE NOT OPENED UNTIL THEY WERE DELIVERED IN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY IT SEEMS ALMOST INCREDIBLE BUT THAT DISTANCE WAS COVERED IN A TIME THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY SHORT FOR THOSE DAYS
7764-106805-0023 WHEN ONE REMEMBERS THAT THE WHOLE JOURNEY WAS MADE BY RUNNING PONIES IT WAS AN EXCITING TIME WHEN THE FIRST PONY WAS READY AND SADDLED AT THE OFFICES OF RUSSELL MAJORS AND WADDELL IN SAINT JOSEPH
7764-106805-0024 A LARGE CROWD GATHERED LONG BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME FOR STARTING AND WHEN THE PONY WAS BROUGHT FORTH HE WAS GREETED WITH CHEERS AT THE EXACT MOMENT A FRONTIERSMAN CAME OUT OF THE OFFICE THREW THE POUCH OVER THE SADDLE
7764-106805-0025 LEAPED ON THE PONY AND STARTED OFF AT THE TOP SPEED THE PONY WAS CAPABLE OF FOLLOWED BY THE CRIES AND CHEERS OF THE CROWD
7764-106805-0026 THAT JOURNEY WHERE THE MAIL BAGS WERE THROWN ACROSS THE PONIES AND CARRIED BY A NUMBER OF RIDERS TOOK TEN DAYS TO DO THE TWO THOUSAND MILES
7764-106805-0027 INCLUDING ALL STOPS AND ALL DELAYS BUT IN A SHORT TIME THE AVERAGE TRIP WAS MADE REGULARLY IN NINE DAYS
7764-106805-0028 WHEN CODY WAS LOOKING FOR WORK HE CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF ENLISTING AS ONE OF THE PONY EXPRESS RIDERS AND HE WENT TO THE OFFICE OF THE COMPANY AND ASKED IF HE COULD NOT BE ONE OF THE RIDERS THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS TOO YOUNG
7764-106805-0029 AS HE WAS THEN ONLY A LITTLE OVER FOURTEEN BUT HE INSISTED HE COULD DO IT AND FINALLY THEY GAVE HIM THE SHORTEST TRIP A RIDE OF THIRTY FIVE MILES WITH THREE CHANGES OF PONIES
7764-106805-0030 WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR HIM TO BE READY FOR THE FIRST TRIP THE BOY WAS OUTSIDE OF HIS STATION WITH HIS PONY READY LOOKING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE FOR THE RIDER WHO WAS TO BRING THE MAIL POUCHES FROM THE NEXT STATION CLOSE UPON TIME THE MAN APPEARED
7764-106805-0031 DRAWING UP TO THE STATION HE JUMPED OFF THREW THE BAG TO CODY WHO IN TURN LEAPED INTO HIS SADDLE WITH IT AND STARTED ON HIS FIFTEEN MILES HE REACHED HIS FIRST STATION ON TIME
7764-106805-0032 AND SO WITH THE THIRD UNTIL HE FINISHED HIS THIRTY FIVE MILES AND THREW THE BAG TO THE NEXT MAN WHO WAS WAITING AND WITHIN AN HOUR HE WAS READY AGAIN FOR THE RIDER COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF SAN FRANCISCO AS SOON AS HE HAD THE MAIL
7764-106805-0033 HE MOUNTED A FRESH PONY AND RODE BACK OVER THE SAME THIRTY FIVE MILES THUS THE BOY DID SEVENTY MILES EVERY DAY FOR THREE MONTHS BUT ENDURANCE WAS NOT THE ONLY QUALITY THE RIDER MUST HAVE THROUGH MOST OF THE WHOLE ROUTE
7764-106805-0034 THERE WAS CONSTANT DANGER OF A HOLD UP EITHER FROM INDIANS OR FROM OUTLAWS WHO KNEW THAT THE BAG FREQUENTLY CONTAINED MONEY HE MUST BE AS ALERT AND AS GOOD A FRONTIERSMAN IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF INDIAN WARFARE AS HE WAS A GOOD HORSEMAN
7764-106805-0035 IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THE BOY HAD ANY INCIDENT OTHER THAN THE ORDINARY EPISODES OF THE LONG RIDE HOWEVER THE TIME CAME HE WAS RIDING AS FAST AS HIS PONY COULD GO THROUGH A RAVINE ONE DAY
7764-106805-0036 WHEN THERE SPRANG OUT IN FRONT OF HIM IN THE NARROW TRACK A MAN WITH HIS RIFLE AT HIS SHOULDER YOUNG CODY KNEW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE MAN HAD WHAT WAS CALLED THE DROP ON HIM THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT PULL UP AND AWAIT EVENTS
7764-106805-0037 IT WAS A WHITE MAN A DESPERADO OF THE PLAINS HE TOLD THE BOY THAT HE MEANT HIM NO HARM BUT THAT HE WANTED THE MONEY IN THE BAG CODY COULD DO NOTHING BUT SIT QUIETLY ON HIS PONY BUT ALWAYS ALERT
7764-106805-0038 ALWAYS ON THE WATCH FOR EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN A SITUATION THAT YOUNG AS HE WAS HE HAD BEEN IN MANY TIMES BEFORE HE KEPT A KEEN EYE ON THE MAN WHILE APPEARING TO SUBMIT THE OUTLAW WAS CARELESS ENOUGH TO APPROACH THE PONY FROM THE FRONT
7764-106805-0039 AND AS HE GOT WITHIN REACH THE YOUNG HORSEMAN BY A TRICK THAT HE HAD USED MANY TIMES BEFORE MADE THE PONY REAR SO SUDDENLY THAT HIS FORE FOOT STRUCK THE MAN IN THE HEAD AND KNOCKED HIM SENSELESS BILL KNEW THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY
7764-106805-0040 THE HIGHWAYMAN HAD A HORSE HE AT ONCE DISMOUNTED BOUND THE MAN HAND AND FOOT WHILE HE WAS INSENSIBLE AND THEN BEGAN TO HUNT FOR THE HORSE IN THE BUSHES HE FOUND HIM A FEW RODS AWAY
7764-106805-0041 UNBINDING HIS LEGS BILL FORCED HIM TO MOUNT HIS OWN HORSE AND THEN STRAPPED HIM ON ALTHOUGH THE YOUNG PONY EXPRESSMAN WAS LATE AT THE NEXT STATION
7764-106805-0042 FOR THE DELAY OF THE MAIL THAT DAY AT THE END OF A FEW MONTHS THE WORK PROVED TOO SEVERE FOR HIM TO CONTINUE AND HE WAS LAID OFF AS SUPERNUMERARY THAT IS A MAN WHO COULD BE CALLED ON TO RIDE IN ANY EMERGENCY
7764-106805-0043 IT WAS NOT LONG HOWEVER BEFORE HE MADE APPLICATION FOR ANOTHER JOB ON THE PONY EXPRESS HE WENT TO FORT LARAMIE AND LOOKED UP A MAN NAMED SLADE WHO WAS AGENT OF THE LINE THERE SLADE TOLD HIM HE WAS TOO YOUNG
7764-106805-0044 BUT ON HEARING HIS NAME HE SLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AND THAT HE WOULD GIVE HIM A JOB
7764-106805-0045 AND THE DISTANCE WAS SEVENTY SIX MILES THE BOY STARTED RUNNING THIS ROUTE REGULARLY EACH DAY AND FOR A TIME HAD NO UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE ONE DAY HOWEVER HAVING MADE THE RUN OUT OF SEVENTY SIX MILES
7764-106805-0046 HE FOUND WHEN HE ARRIVED AT HIS LAST STATION THAT THE MAN WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO CARRY THE BAG TO THE NEXT STATION A DISTANCE OF EIGHTY FIVE MILES HAD BEEN WOUNDED BY INDIANS BILL OFFERED TO GO ON AND CARRY THE BAG OVER THAT MAN'S SECTION
7764-106805-0047 AND AS THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO DO IT HE WAS SENT ON THIS SECOND DIVISION COVERED A DISTANCE OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE MILES THAT MADE ONE CONTINUOUS ROUTE OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILES OUT AND BACK WITHOUT STOPPING
7764-106805-0048 IN THAT TIME HE RODE TWENTY ONE PONIES AND MADE THE LONGEST TRIP EVER MADE BY A PONY EXPRESS RIDER
7764-106805-0049 THERE WAS NO TIME FOR THOUGHT AND BILL IMMEDIATELY REACHED FOR HIS REVOLVER BUT UPON SEEING HIM THE MAN DROPPED HIS RIFLE AND CAME FORWARD HE TURNED OUT TO BE A FAMOUS CHARACTER OF THE PLAINS NAMED CALIFORNIA JOE
7764-106805-0050 AND ON SEEING THE YOUNG BOY HE IMMEDIATELY ASKED HIM IF HE WERE NOT BILL CODY THEN THE FRONTIERSMAN TOLD HIM THAT A LITTLE WAY BACK ON THE ROAD
7764-106805-0051 IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE LATER THAT AS BILL LEFT ONE OF THE STATIONS
7764-106805-0052 THERE WERE REPORTS OF INDIANS IN THE VICINITY CODY SAID HE WOULD AND STARTED AWAY AT BREAKNECK PACE HERE AGAIN AS MANY TIMES BEFORE AND AFTER THE BOY'S INSTINCTIVE KNOWLEDGE AND IMMEDIATE PERCEPTION OF ANYTHING NO MATTER HOW SMALL
7764-106805-0053 THAT WAS UNUSUAL OR UNNATURAL ON THE PLAINS SAVED HIS LIFE ALWAYS KEEPING A KEEN WATCH HE SUDDENLY SAW ABOVE THE TOP OF A PILE OF ROCKS SOMETHING THAT HE KNEW WAS NOT PUT THERE BY NATURE IT WAS A LITTLE SPECK OF COLOR
7764-106805-0054 HE KNEW THAT IT WAS A FEATHER IN THE HEADDRESS OF AN INDIAN IN WAR PAINT HE DID NOT STOP OR TURN
7764-106805-0055 THEN DUCKING BEHIND HIS PONY HE TURNED HIM INSTANTLY OFF THE TRAIL AND AT THE SAME MOMENT A PUFF OF SMOKE FROM BEHIND THE ROCK SHOWED THAT HIS GUESS HAD BEEN TRUE THE BULLET WENT WHERE THE RIDER SHOULD HAVE BEEN
7764-106805-0056 BUT IT MISSED BY THE SWERVE WHICH HE HAD CAUSED THE PONY TO MAKE OUT SPRANG TWO WARRIORS AND A PARTY OF INDIANS APPEARED FROM A LITTLE DISTANCE FURTHER AWAY
7764-106805-0057 AS HE APPROACHED THE END OF THE VALLEY WHICH NARROWED INTO A POINT HE SAW THAT SOME OF THE INDIANS ON THE SLOPES WERE RIDING DOWN TO CUT OFF HIS TRACK HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY AND LUCKILY FOR HIM THOSE INDIANS HAD NO RIFLES
7764-106805-0058 HE SAW THEM FIT THE ARROWS TO THEIR BOWS WAITED FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT AND JUST BEFORE THE LEADING INDIAN FIRED HIS ARROW THE BOY SHOT HIM WITH HIS REVOLVER WHEN HE REACHED THE NEXT STATION
7764-106805-0059 HE FOUND THAT HIS PONY HAD TWO ARROWS STICKING IN ITS FLESH AT THIS TIME THE PONY EXPRESS HAD TO BE STOPPED FOR SOME TIME ON ACCOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF INDIANS WHO WERE LYING IN WAIT ALL ALONG THE TRAILS TO CAPTURE THE RIDERS
7764-106805-0060 AND SO THE BOY WAS ONCE MORE OUT OF A JOB HE BECAME A SUPERNUMERARY AGAIN AND AS THERE WERE DAYS IN WHICH HE HAD NOTHING TO DO HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF GOING OUT HUNTING
7764-106805-0061 ON ONE OF THESE TRIPS HE CAME UPON A GROUP OF HORSES TIED NEAR A STREAM AND HEARING VOICES IN A DUGOUT CAVE NEAR BY HE WENT TO INVESTIGATE IT TURNED OUT THAT THE MEN WERE A GROUP OF PRAIRIE RUFFIANS
7764-106805-0062 THEY SUPPOSED HIM TO BE AN ADVANCE SCOUT IN SEARCH OF THEMSELVES AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS
7764-106805-0063 HE POINTED BACKWARD THEY ASKED WHERE HIS HORSE WAS HE SAID IT WAS DOWN BY THE STREAM THEY ASKED HIM TO GO AND GET IT AND JOIN THEM HE SAID HE WOULD VOLUNTEERING WITH THE KEENNESS OF MEN WHOSE LIVES ARE ALWAYS AT STAKE
7764-106805-0064 TO LEAVE HIS GUN WITH THEM THAT ALLAYED SUSPICION FOR THE MOMENT BUT THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SEND TWO OF THEIR NUMBER WITH HIM THE BOY AS THEY REACHED THE HORSE CARELESSLY SAID THAT HE HAD SHOT SOME GAME AND WOULD PICK IT UP
7764-106805-0065 IN THE MEANTIME ASKING THE MEN TO LEAD HIS HORSE ON AHEAD THEN TURNING BEHIND THE SECOND MAN HE STRUCK HIM A BLOW WITH HIS REVOLVER AND SHOT THE OTHER MOUNTING HIS PONY CODY THEN DASHED DOWN THE RAVINE
7764-106805-0066 IN A MOMENT THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AFTER HIM IT WAS CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD SOON BE OVERTAKEN
7764-106805-0067 BILL TURNED THE CORNER OF SOME ROCKS AND DISMOUNTING GAVE THE PONY A SLAP AND SENT HIM TEARING DOWN THE RAVINE WHILE HE HIMSELF HID IN THE BUSHES AND WATCHED THE WHOLE PARTY TEAR BY IN THE PURSUIT OF THE RIDERLESS HORSE
7764-106805-0068 HE THEN CALMLY WALKED BACK TO THE STATION AT HORSESHOE AND TOLD OF THE ADVENTURE SUCH EXPERIENCES AS THIS FOLLOWED ONE AFTER ANOTHER UNTIL IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE WITH THE CIVIL WAR IN FULL PROGRESS
7764-106805-0069 CODY THEN SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD RECEIVED WORD THAT HIS MOTHER WAS DYING HE WENT IMMEDIATELY TO THEIR HOME AND ARRIVED IN TIME TO SEE HIS MOTHER BEFORE SHE DIED
7764-106805-0070 HE HAD KEPT HIS WORD WITH HIS MOTHER AND HAD NOT BECOME A SOLDIER AS LONG AS SHE LIVED BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS DEAD AND THE FAMILY HOMESTEAD OUT OF DEBT HE WAS FREE FROM ALL PROMISES HE AT ONCE ENLISTED
7764-106805-0071 AND HIS REGIMENT WAS SOON ORDERED TO THE FRONT BUT THE YOUNG MAN WAS SO ABLE AS A SCOUT THAT HE SOON CAME TO BE USED ON SPECIAL DUTY THEN TOO HIS FAME AS A PLAINSMAN WAS WELL KNOWN
7764-106805-0072 HE WAS AT ONCE SELECTED THEREFORE AS A BEARER OF MILITARY DISPATCHES AT FORT LARNED AND ONE OF HIS FIRST ESCAPADES TOOK PLACE SOON AFTER HE WAS PUT UPON THIS WORK
7764-106805-0073 THESE MEN NOW ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE
7764-106805-0074 THEY HID THEIR HORSES IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND WENT TO A CABIN NEAR THE FORD TO WAIT FOR HIS ARRIVAL
7764-106805-0075 AND AS BY THIS TIME THE YOUNG MAN HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF ABSOLUTELY OBSERVING EVERYTHING AT ALL TIMES ABOUT HIM HE SOON DISCOVERED THE FRESH TRACKS OF HORSES
7764-106805-0076 WITHOUT ANY OTHER OBJECT THAN THE NATURAL INSTINCT TO FIND THE REASON FOR EVERYTHING THAT PRESENTED ITSELF HE QUIETLY DISMOUNTED FOLLOWED THE TRAIL AND FOUND THE FIVE HORSES
7764-106805-0077 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE FIVE MEN NEAR BY WATCHING FOR HIM THE ONLY THING TO DO WAS TO RIDE ON AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE AND TRY TO MAKE THE FORD
7764-106805-0078 HE TURNED IN HIS SADDLE AND BEFORE ANY OF THE FIVE COULD PULL A TRIGGER HE HAD SHOT ONE OF THEM
