5386-4145-0000 HERE WE SEE GOD DEALING IN SLAVES GIVING THEM TO HIS OWN FAVOURITE CHILD ABRAHAM A MAN OF SUPERLATIVE WORTH AND AS A REWARD FOR HIS EMINENT GOODNESS
5386-4145-0001 THE CONDITION OF THE NEGROES HUCKELBY AND SNYDER AND ESPECIALLY HOW HE LIKED THE SERMON OF THE LATTER MISTER PECK WAS A KIND OF A PATRIARCH IN HIS OWN WAY TO BEGIN WITH HE WAS A MAN OF SOME TALENT
5386-4145-0002 HE NOT ONLY HAD A GOOD EDUCATION BUT WAS A MAN OF GREAT ELOQUENCE AND HAD A WONDERFUL COMMAND OF LANGUAGE HE TOO EITHER HAD OR THOUGHT HE HAD POETICAL GENIUS AND WAS OFTEN SENDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NATCHEZ FREE TRADER AND OTHER PERIODICALS
5386-4145-0003 IN THE WAY OF RAISING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS HE TOOK THE LEAD OF ALL OTHERS IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD EVERYTHING HE DID HE DID FOR THE GLORY OF GOD AS HE SAID HE QUOTED SCRIPTURE FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING HE DID
5386-4145-0004 BEING IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE TO ALMOST ALL BENEVOLENT CAUSES TO WHICH HE TOOK A FANCY HE WAS A MOST LOVING FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTER EXERCISED CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER HIM AND OWING TO HER PIETY AND JUDGMENT THAT INFLUENCE HAD A BENEFICIAL EFFECT
5386-4145-0005 CARLTON THOUGH A SCHOOLFELLOW OF THE PARSON'S WAS NEVERTHELESS NEARLY TEN YEARS HIS JUNIOR AND THOUGH NOT AN AVOWED INFIDEL WAS HOWEVER A FREETHINKER AND ONE WHO TOOK NO NOTE OF TO MORROW AND FOR THIS REASON GEORGIANA TOOK PECULIAR INTEREST IN THE YOUNG MAN
5386-4145-0006 THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN FELT THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING UP TO THAT FAITH THAT SHE PROFESSED AND BELIEVED IN IF SHE DID NOT EXERT HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO SAVE THE THOUGHTLESS MAN FROM HIS DOWNWARD CAREER AND IN THIS SHE SUCCEEDED TO HER MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS
5386-4145-0007 GEORGIANA'S FIRST OBJECT HOWEVER WAS TO AWAKEN IN CARLTON'S BREAST A LOVE FOR THE LORD JESUS CHRIST THE YOUNG MAN HAD OFTEN SAT UNDER THE SOUND OF THE GOSPEL WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE HE HAD HEARD MEN TALK WHO HAD GROWN GREY BENDING OVER THE SCRIPTURES
5386-4145-0008 AND THEIR CONVERSATION HAD PASSED BY HIM UNHEEDED BUT WHEN A YOUNG GIRL MUCH YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF REASONED WITH HIM IN THAT INNOCENT AND PERSUASIVE MANNER THAT WOMAN IS WONT TO USE WHEN SHE HAS ENTERED WITH HER WHOLE SOUL UPON AN OBJECT IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIS STOUT HEART AND HE YIELDED
5386-4145-0009 HER NEXT AIM WAS TO VINDICATE THE BIBLE FROM SUSTAINING THE MONSTROUS INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY SHE SAID GOD HAS CREATED OF ONE BLOOD ALL THE NATIONS OF MEN TO DWELL ON ALL THE FACE OF THE EARTH TO CLAIM HOLD AND TREAT A HUMAN BEING AS PROPERTY IS FELONY AGAINST GOD AND MAN
5386-4145-0010 THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS OPPOSED TO SLAVEHOLDING IN ITS SPIRIT AND ITS PRINCIPLES IT CLASSES MENSTEALERS AMONG MURDERERS AND IT IS THE DUTY OF ALL WHO WISH TO MEET GOD IN PEACE TO DISCHARGE THAT DUTY IN SPREADING THESE PRINCIPLES
5386-4145-0011 LET US NOT DECEIVE OURSELVES INTO THE IDEA THAT SLAVERY IS RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS PROFITABLE TO US SLAVEHOLDING IS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT TO TAKE FROM A MAN HIS EARNINGS IS THEFT BUT TO TAKE THE EARNER IS A COMPOUND LIFE LONG THEFT
5386-4145-0012 SHOULD DO OUR UTMOST TO EXTIRPATE SLAVERY FROM THE LAND FOR MY OWN PART I SHALL DO ALL I CAN WHEN THE REDEEMER WAS ABOUT TO ASCEND TO THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER AND RESUME THE GLORY WHICH HE HAD WITH HIM BEFORE THE WORLD WAS HE PROMISED HIS DISCIPLES THAT THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST SHOULD COME UPON THEM
5386-4145-0013 WHAT WAS THE EFFECT UPON THEIR MINDS THEY ALL CONTINUED WITH ONE ACCORD IN PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION WITH THE WOMEN STIMULATED BY THE CONFIDENT EXPECTATION THAT JESUS WOULD FULFIL HIS GRACIOUS PROMISE THEY POURED OUT THEIR HEARTS IN FERVENT SUPPLICATIONS
5386-4145-0014 PROBABLY FOR STRENGTH TO DO THE WORK WHICH HE HAD APPOINTED THEM UNTO FOR THEY FELT THAT WITHOUT HIM THEY COULD DO NOTHING AND THEY CONSECRATED THEMSELVES ON THE ALTAR OF GOD TO THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS ENTERPRISE OF PREACHING THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST TO A LOST AND PERISHING WORLD
5386-4145-0015 HAVE WE LESS PRECIOUS PROMISES IN THE SCRIPTURES OF TRUTH MAY WE NOT CLAIM OF OUR GOD THE BLESSING PROMISED UNTO THOSE WHO CONSIDER THE POOR
5386-4145-0016 DOES NOT THE LANGUAGE INASMUCH AS YE DID IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE DID IT UNTO ME BELONG TO ALL WHO ARE RIGHTLY ENGAGED IN ENDEAVOURING TO UNLOOSE THE BONDMAN'S FETTERS SHALL WE NOT THEN DO AS THE APOSTLES DID
5386-4145-0017 CONTINUE IN PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION THAT GOD WILL GRANT US THE SUPPLIES OF HIS SPIRIT
5386-4145-0018 TO GRANT REPENTANCE TO OUR GUILTY COUNTRY AND PERMIT US TO AID IN PREPARING THE WAY FOR THE GLORIOUS SECOND ADVENT OF THE MESSIAH BY PREACHING DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES AND THE OPENING OF THE PRISON DOORS TO THOSE WHO ARE BOUND
5386-4145-0019 GEORGIANA HAD SUCCEEDED IN RIVETING THE ATTENTION OF CARLTON DURING HER CONVERSATION AND AS SHE WAS FINISHING HER LAST SENTENCE SHE OBSERVED THE SILENT TEAR STEALING DOWN THE CHEEK OF THE NEWLY BORN CHILD OF GOD AT THIS JUNCTURE HER FATHER ENTERED AND CARLTON LEFT THE ROOM DEAR PAPA
5386-4145-0020 SAID GEORGIANA WILL YOU GRANT ME ONE FAVOUR OR RATHER MAKE ME A PROMISE I CAN'T TELL MY DEAR TILL I KNOW WHAT IT IS REPLIED MISTER PECK IF IT IS A REASONABLE REQUEST I WILL COMPLY WITH YOUR WISH CONTINUED HE I HOPE MY DEAR ANSWERED SHE
5386-4145-0021 WHY GEORGIANA MY DEAR YOU ARE MAD AIN'T YOU EXCLAIMED HE IN AN EXCITED TONE THE POOR GIRL REMAINED SILENT THE FATHER SAW IN A MOMENT THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TOO SHARPLY AND TAKING HER HAND IN HIS HE SAID
5386-4145-0022 FOR THE ARGUMENT FROM INTERNAL EVIDENCE IS NOT ONLY REFUTED BUT ACTUALLY TURNED AGAINST THE BIBLE IF THE BIBLE SANCTIONS SLAVERY THEN IT MISREPRESENTS THE CHARACTER OF GOD NOTHING WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS TO THE SOUL OF A YOUNG CONVERT
5386-4145-0023 THAN TO SATISFY HIM THAT THE SCRIPTURES FAVOURED SUCH A SYSTEM OF SIN DON'T YOU SUPPOSE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES BETTER THAN YOU
5386-4145-0024 YES ANSWERED HE I DID NOT KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT THEN
5386-4145-0025 I DON'T THINK THAT THE BIBLE SANCTIONS SLAVERY
5386-4145-0026 OR IF HE BE FOUND IN HIS BAND HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH AND WOE UNTO HIM THAT BUILDETH HIS HOUSE BY UNRIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIS CHAMBERS BY WRONG THAT USETH HIS NEIGHBOUR'S SERVICE WITHOUT WAGES AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS WORK
5386-4145-0027 WHEN ALSO THE NEW TESTAMENT EXHIBITS SUCH WORDS OF REBUKE AS THESE BEHOLD THE HIRE OF THE LABOURERS WHO HAVE REAPED DOWN YOUR FIELDS WHICH IS OF YOU KEPT BACK BY FRAUD CRIETH
5386-4145-0028 FOR MENSTEALERS FOR LIARS FOR PERJURED PERSONS A MORE SCATHING DENUNCIATION OF THE SIN IN QUESTION IS SURELY TO BE FOUND ON RECORD IN NO OTHER BOOK I AM AFRAID CONTINUED THE DAUGHTER THAT THE ACTS OF THE PROFESSED FRIENDS OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE SOUTH
5386-4145-0029 MEMBERS IN GOOD AND REGULAR STANDING FELLOWSHIPPED THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM EXCEPT BY A FEW ANTI SLAVERY CHURCHES GENERALLY DESPISED AS ULTRA AND RADICAL REDUCE THEIR FELLOW MEN TO THE CONDITION OF CHATTELS AND BY FORCE KEEP THEM IN THAT STATE OF DEGRADATION
5386-4145-0030 VERY GENERALLY DEFEND THE CONDUCT OF THOSE WHO DO AND ACCORD TO THEM A FAIR CHRISTIAN CHARACTER
5386-4145-0031 AND MUST NOT THIS CONCLUSION BE STRENGTHENED WHEN THEY HEAR MINISTERS OF TALENT AND LEARNING DECLARE THAT THE BIBLE DOES SANCTION SLAVEHOLDING AND THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE MADE A DISCIPLINABLE OFFENCE IN CHURCHES AND MUST NOT ALL DOUBT BE DISSIPATED WHEN ONE OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS IN OUR THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES
5386-4145-0032 WHEN HE DESIGNED TO DO US GOOD HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE FORM OF A SERVANT HE TOOK HIS STATION AT THE BOTTOM OF SOCIETY HE VOLUNTARILY IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH THE POOR AND THE DESPISED THE WARNING VOICES OF JEREMIAH AND EZEKIEL WERE RAISED IN OLDEN TIME AGAINST SIN
5386-4145-0033 LET US NOT FORGET WHAT FOLLOWED THEREFORE THUS SAITH THE LORD YE HAVE NOT HARKENED UNTO ME IN PROCLAIMING LIBERTY EVERY ONE TO HIS BROTHER AND EVERY ONE TO HIS NEIGHBOUR BEHOLD I PROCLAIM A LIBERTY FOR YOU SAITH THE LORD TO THE SWORD TO THE PESTILENCE AND TO THE FAMINE
5386-4145-0034 THEN SHOULD OUR LABOUR FAIL TO ACCOMPLISH THE END FOR WHICH WE PRAY WE SHALL STAND ACQUITTED AT THE BAR OF JEHOVAH AND ALTHOUGH WE MAY SHARE IN THE NATIONAL CALAMITIES WHICH AWAIT UNREPENTED SINS YET THAT BLESSED APPROVAL WILL BE OURS
5386-4145-0035 MY DEAR GEORGIANA SAID MISTER PECK I MUST BE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN MY OWN VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT AND TO EXERCISE MY OWN JUDGMENT BELIEVE ME DEAR PAPA SHE REPLIED
5386-4145-0036 BUT ONLY GRANT MY REQUEST NOT TO ALLUDE TO THE BIBLE AS SANCTIONING SLAVERY WHEN SPEAKING WITH MISTER CARLTON WELL RETURNED HE
5386-4145-0037 AND NO ONE WAS MORE ABLE THAN HERSELF TO IMPRESS THOSE VIEWS UPON THE HEARTS OF ALL WITH WHOM SHE CAME IN CONTACT
