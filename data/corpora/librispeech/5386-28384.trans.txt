5386-28384-0000 THAT THE GERMAN YOUTH OFTEN VISIT SAXONY IN QUEST OF COMPANIONS FOR LIFE EXCLUSIVE OF THEIR BEAUTY AND COMELINESS OF APPEARANCE THEY ARE BROUGHT UP IN A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THOSE ARTS BOTH USEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL WHICH ARE SO BRILLIANT AN ADDITION TO THEIR NATIVE ATTRACTIONS
5386-28384-0001 BUT WHAT CHIEFLY ENHANCES THEIR VALUE AND GIVES IT REALITY AND DURATION IS A SWEETNESS OF TEMPER AND FESTIVITY OF DISPOSITION THAT NEVER FAIL TO ENDEAR THEM ON A VERY SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE TO CROWN ALL THEY ARE GENERALLY PATTERNS OF CONJUGAL TENDERNESS AND FIDELITY
5386-28384-0002 AS THEY ARE COMMONLY CAREFUL TO IMPROVE THEIR MINDS BY READING AND INSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION THEY HAVE NO SMALL SHARE OF FACETIOUSNESS AND INGENUITY
5386-28384-0003 THEY EXCEL IN THE ALLUREMENTS OF DRESS AND DECORATION AND ARE IN GENERAL SKILFUL IN MUSIC THE CHARACTER HOWEVER OF THE WOMEN IN MOST OTHER PARTS OF GERMANY PARTICULARLY OF THE AUSTRIAN IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THIS NOTWITHSTANDING THE ADVANTAGES OF SIZE AND MAKE
5386-28384-0004 THEIR LOOKS AND FEATURES THOUGH NOT UNSIGHTLY BETRAY A VACANCY OF THAT LIFE AND SPIRIT WITHOUT WHICH BEAUTY IS UNINTERESTING AND LIKE A MERE PICTURE BECOMES UTTERLY VOID OF THAT INDICATION OF SENSIBILITY WHICH ALONE CAN AWAKEN A DELICACY OF FEELING
5386-28384-0005 AS THEIR EDUCATION IS CONDUCTED BY THE RULES OF THE GROSSEST SUPERSTITION AND THEY ARE TAUGHT LITTLE ELSE THAN SET FORMS OF DEVOTION THEY ARRIVE TO THE YEARS OF MATURITY UNINSTRUCTED IN THE USE OF REASON AND USUALLY CONTINUE PROFOUNDLY IGNORANT THE REMAINDER OF THEIR DAYS
5386-28384-0006 AND THE PREROGATIVES THEY ENJOY OVER THE INFERIOR CLASSES WHOM THEY TREAT WITH THE UTMOST SUPERCILIOUSNESS AND HOLD IN THE MOST UNREASONABLE CONTEMPT IN THE MEAN TIME THEIR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS ARE CONDEMNED TO THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE NEGLECT THEY DWELL AT HOME CARELESS OF WHAT PASSES THERE
5386-28384-0007 AND SUFFER DISORDER AND CONFUSION TO PREVAIL WITHOUT FEELING THE LEAST UNEASINESS GREAT FREQUENTERS OF CHURCHES THEIR PIETY CONSISTS IN THE STRICTEST CONFORMITY TO ALL THE EXTERNALS OF RELIGION
5386-28384-0008 THEY PROFESS THE MOST BOUNDLESS BELIEF IN ALL THE SILLY LEGENDS WITH WHICH THEIR TREATISES OF DEVOTION ARE FILLED AND THESE ARE THE ONLY BOOKS THEY EVER READ THE COLDNESS OF THEIR CONSTITUTION OCCASIONS A SPECIES OF REGULATED GALLANTRY
5386-28384-0009 ARE YET CAPABLE OF THE TRUEST ATTACHMENT AND ALWAYS WARM AND ZEALOUS IN THE CAUSE OF THOSE WHOM THEY HAVE ADMITTED TO THEIR FRIENDSHIP THOUGH THE GERMANS ARE RATHER A DULL AND PHLEGMATIC PEOPLE AND NOT GREATLY ENSLAVED BY THE WARMER PASSIONS YET AT THE COURT OF VIENNA THEY ARE MUCH GIVEN TO INTRIGUE
5386-28384-0010 AND WE ARE WELL ASSURED THAT IN GERMANY THERE ARE MANY WOMEN WHO DO HONOR TO HUMANITY NOT BY CHASTITY ONLY BUT ALSO BY A VARIETY OF OTHER VIRTUES THE LADIES AT THE PRINCIPAL COURTS DIFFER NOT MUCH IN THEIR DRESS FROM THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH
5386-28384-0011 DRESS IN A VERY DIFFERENT MANNER AND SOME OF THEM INCONCEIVABLY FANTASTIC AS MAY BE SEEN IN MANY PRINTS PUBLISHED IN BOOKS OF TRAVELS BUT IN THIS RESPECT THEY ARE GRADUALLY REFORMING AND MANY OF THEM MAKE QUITE A DIFFERENT APPEARANCE IN THEIR DRESS FROM WHAT THEY DID THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO
5386-28384-0012 THE INHABITANTS OF VIENNA LIVED LUXURIOUSLY A GREAT PART OF THEIR TIME BEING SPENT IN FEASTING AND CAROUSING IN WINTER WHEN THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE DANUBE ARE FROZEN OVER AND THE GROUND COVERED WITH SNOW THE LADIES TAKE THEIR RECREATION IN SLEDGES OF DIFFERENT SHAPES SUCH AS GRIFFINS
5386-28384-0013 TIGERS SWANS SCALLOP SHELLS ET CETERA HERE THE LADY SITS DRESSED IN VELVET LINED WITH RICH FURS AND ADORNED WITH LACES AND JEWELS HAVING ON HER HEAD A VELVET CAP THE SLEDGE IS DRAWN BY ONE HORSE STAG OR OTHER CREATURE
5386-28384-0014 SET OFF WITH PLUMES OF FEATHERS RIBBONS AND BELLS AS THIS DIVERSION IS TAKEN CHIEFLY IN THE NIGHT TIME SERVANTS RIDE BEFORE THE SLEDGE WITH TORCHES AND A GENTLEMAN STANDING ON THE SLEDGE BEHIND GUIDES THE HORSE
5386-28384-0015 A VIEW OF MATRIMONY IN THREE DIFFERENT LIGHTS THE MARRIAGE LIFE IS ALWAYS AN INSIPID A VEXATIOUS OR A HAPPY CONDITION THE FIRST IS WHEN TWO PEOPLE OF NO TASTE MEET TOGETHER
5386-28384-0016 BUT SHE GOES WITH HER FORTUNE RATHER THAN HER FORTUNE WITH HER THESE MAKE UP THE CROWD OR VULGAR OF THE RICH AND FILL UP THE LUMBER OF THE HUMAN RACE WITHOUT BENEFICENCE TOWARDS THOSE BELOW THEM OR RESPECT TOWARDS THOSE ABOVE THEM AND LEAD A DESPICABLE INDEPENDENT AND USELESS LIFE
5386-28384-0017 WITHOUT SENSE OF THE LAWS OF KINDNESS GOOD NATURE MUTUAL OFFICES AND THE ELEGANT SATISFACTIONS WHICH FLOW FROM REASON AND VIRTUE THE VEXATIOUS LIFE ARISES FROM A CONJUNCTION OF TWO PEOPLE OF QUICK TASTE AND RESENTMENT PUT TOGETHER FOR REASONS WELL KNOWN TO THEIR FRIENDS
5386-28384-0018 THESE GOOD PEOPLE LIVE IN A CONSTANT RESTRAINT BEFORE COMPANY AND WHEN ALONE REVILE EACH OTHER'S PERSON AND CONDUCT IN COMPANY THEY ARE IN PURGATORY WHEN BY THEMSELVES IN HELL THE HAPPY MARRIAGE IS WHERE TWO PERSONS MEET
5386-28384-0019 THE FORMER WE MAY IN SOME MEASURE DEFEND OURSELVES FROM THE OTHER IS THE COMMON LOT OF HUMANITY LOVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RICHES OR STATE SOLITUDE WITH THE PERSON BELOVED HAS A PLEASURE EVEN IN A WOMAN'S MIND BEYOND SHOW OR POMP
5386-28384-0020 BETROTHING AND MARRIAGE AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD FAMILIES WHO LIVED IN A FRIENDLY MANNER FELL UPON A METHOD OF SECURING THEIR CHILDREN TO EACH OTHER BY WHAT IS CALLED IN THE SACRED WRITINGS BETROTHING
5386-28384-0021 THIS WAS AGREEING ON A PRICE TO BE PAID FOR THE BRIDE THE TIME WHEN IT SHOULD BE PAID AND WHEN SHE SHOULD BE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF HER HUSBAND THERE WERE ACCORDING TO THE TALMUDISTS THREE WAYS OF BETROTHING
5386-28384-0022 THE SECOND BY A VERBAL AGREEMENT ACCOMPANIED WITH A PIECE OF MONEY AND THE THIRD BY THE PARTIES COMING TOGETHER AND LIVING AS HUSBAND AND WIFE WHICH MIGHT AS PROPERLY BE CALLED MARRIAGE AS BETROTHING THE WRITTEN CONTRACT WAS IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
5386-28384-0023 WHICH THE SAID A DOTH PROMISE TO PERFORM ON THE DAY OF MARRIAGE AND TO THIS THE SAID A DOTH HEREBY BIND HIMSELF AND ALL THAT HE HATH TO THE VERY CLOAK UPON HIS BACK ENGAGES HIMSELF TO LOVE HONOR FEED CLOTHE AND PROTECT HER
5386-28384-0024 AND TO PERFORM ALL THAT IS GENERALLY IMPLIED IN CONTRACTS OF MARRIAGE IN FAVOR OF THE ISRAELITISH WIVES THE VERBAL AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF WITNESSES BY THE MAN SAYING TO THE WOMEN
5386-28384-0025 MARRIAGES AMONG THE JEWS SAY THE RABBIES WERE AGREED ON BY THE PARENTS AND RELATIONS OF BOTH SIDES WHEN THIS WAS DONE THE BRIDEGROOM WAS INTRODUCED TO HIS BRIDE PRESENTS WERE MUTUALLY EXCHANGED
5386-28384-0026 WAS SENT AWAY TO THE HABITATION OF HER HUSBAND IN THE NIGHT WITH SINGING DANCING AND THE SOUND OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BY THE INSTITUTION OF MOSES THE RABBIES TELL US THE CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE WAS READ IN THE PRESENCE OF AND SIGNED BY AT LEAST TEN WITNESSES
5386-28384-0027 WHO WERE FREE AND OF AGE THE BRIDE WHO HAD TAKEN CARE TO BATHE HERSELF THE NIGHT BEFORE APPEARED IN ALL HER SPLENDOR BUT VEILED IN IMITATION OF REBECCA WHO VEILED HERSELF WHEN SHE CAME IN SIGHT OF ISAAC SHE WAS THEN GIVEN TO THE BRIDEGROOM BY HER PARENTS IN WORDS TO THIS PURPOSE
5386-28384-0028 TAKE HER ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES AND HE RECEIVED HER BY SAYING I TAKE HER ACCORDING TO THAT LAW SOME BLESSINGS WERE THEN PRONOUNCED ON THE YOUNG COUPLE BOTH BY THE PARENTS AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY THE BLESSINGS OR PRAYERS GENERALLY RUN IN THIS STYLE
5386-28384-0029 BLESSED ART THOU O LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH WHO HAS CREATED MAN IN THINE OWN LIKENESS AND HAST APPOINTED WOMAN TO BE HIS PARTNER AND COMPANION BLESSED ART THOU WHO FILLEST ZION WITH JOY FOR THE MULTITUDE OF HER CHILDREN BLESSED ART THOU WHO SENDEST GLADNESS TO THE BRIDEGROOM AND HIS BRIDE
5386-28384-0030 WHO HAST ORDAINED FOR THEM LOVE JOY TENDERNESS PEACE AND MUTUAL AFFECTION BE PLEASED TO BLESS NOT ONLY THIS COUPLE BUT JUDAH AND JERUSALEM WITH SONGS OF JOY AND PRAISE FOR THE JOY THAT THOU GIVEST THEM BY THE MULTITUDES OF THEIR SONS AND OF THEIR DAUGHTERS
5386-28384-0031 AFTER THE VIRGINS HAD SUNG A MARRIAGE SONG THE COMPANY PARTOOK OF A REPAST THE MOST MAGNIFICENT THE PARTIES COULD AFFORD AFTER WHICH THEY BEGAN A DANCE THE MEN ROUND THE BRIDEGROOM THE WOMEN ROUND THE BRIDE THEY PRETENDED THAT THIS DANCE WAS OF DIVINE INSTITUTION
5386-28384-0032 AND AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE CEREMONY THE BRIDE WAS THEN CARRIED TO THE NUPTIAL BED AND THE BRIDEGROOM LEFT WITH HER THE COMPANY AGAIN RETURNED TO THEIR FEASTING AND REJOICING AND THE RABBIES INFORM US THAT THIS FEASTING WHEN THE BRIDE WAS A WIDOW
5386-28384-0033 LASTED ONLY THREE DAYS BUT SEVEN IF SHE WAS A VIRGIN AT THE BIRTH OF A SON THE FATHER PLANTED A CEDAR AND AT THAT OF A DAUGHTER HE PLANTED A PINE OF THESE TREES THE NUPTIAL BED WAS CONSTRUCTED WHEN THE PARTIES AT WHOSE BIRTH THEY WERE PLANTED ENTERED INTO THE MARRIED STATE
5386-28384-0034 IT INFALLIBLY DENOTED SEPARATION AND ALL THE ILLS ATTENDING AN UNHAPPY MARRIAGE ON THE WEDDING DAY THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM WERE RICHLY DRESSED AND ADORNED WITH GARLANDS OF HERBS AND FLOWERS THE BRIDE WAS CONDUCTED IN THE EVENING TO THE HOUSE OF HER HUSBAND IN A CHARIOT
5386-28384-0035 SEATED BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND ONE OF HIS RELATIONS WHEN SHE ALIGHTED FROM THE CHARIOT THE AXLE TREE OF IT WAS BURNT TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS NO METHOD FOR HER TO RETURN BACK AS SOON AS THE YOUNG COUPLE ENTERED THE HOUSE FIGS AND OTHER FRUITS WERE THROWN UPON THEIR HEADS TO DENOTE PLENTY
5386-28384-0036 AND TO SING EPITHALAMIA AT THE DOOR OF THEIR BED CHAMBER EPITHALAMIA WERE MARRIAGE SONGS ANCIENTLY SUNG IN PRAISE OF THE BRIDE OR BRIDEGROOM WISHING THEM HAPPINESS PROSPERITY AND A NUMEROUS ISSUE AMONG THE ROMANS THERE WERE THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MARRIAGE
5386-28384-0037 THE CEREMONY OF THE FIRST CONSISTED IN THE YOUNG COUPLE EATING A CAKE TOGETHER MADE ONLY OF WHEAT SALT AND WATER THE SECOND KIND WAS CELEBRATED BY THE PARTIES SOLEMNLY PLEDGING THEIR FAITH TO EACH OTHER BY GIVING AND RECEIVING A PIECE OF MONEY
5386-28384-0038 THIS WAS THE MOST COMMON WAY OF MARRYING AMONG THE ROMANS IT CONTINUED IN USE EVEN AFTER THEY BECAME CHRISTIANS
5386-28384-0039 AND HENCE PERHAPS THE WORDS IN OUR MARRIAGE CEREMONY I THEE ENDOW THE THIRD KIND OF MARRIAGE WAS WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN HAVING COHABITED FOR SOME TIME AND HAD CHILDREN FOUND IT EXPEDIENT TO CONTINUE TOGETHER
5386-28384-0040 IN THIS CASE IF THEY MADE UP THE MATTER BETWEEN THEMSELVES IT BECAME A VALID MARRIAGE AND THE CHILDREN WERE CONSIDERED AS LEGITIMATE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS IS THE PRESENT CUSTOM IN SCOTLAND
5386-28384-0041 THE CASE IS THE SAME IN HOLLAND AND SOME PARTS OF GERMANY WITH THIS DIFFERENCE ONLY
