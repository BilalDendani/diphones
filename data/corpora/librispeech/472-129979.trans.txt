472-129979-0007 TO BE MORE THOROUGHLY GOOD NATURED OR MORE DETERMINED TO BE HAPPY THAN MISSUS PALMER THE STUDIED INDIFFERENCE INSOLENCE AND DISCONTENT OF HER HUSBAND GAVE HER NO PAIN AND WHEN HE SCOLDED OR ABUSED HER SHE WAS HIGHLY DIVERTED
472-129979-0008 ALWAYS OUT OF HUMOUR ELINOR WAS NOT INCLINED AFTER A LITTLE OBSERVATION TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR BEING SO GENUINELY AND UNAFFECTEDLY ILL NATURED OR ILL BRED AS HE WISHED TO APPEAR HIS TEMPER MIGHT
472-129979-0009 PERHAPS BE A LITTLE SOURED BY FINDING LIKE MANY OTHERS OF HIS SEX THAT THROUGH SOME UNACCOUNTABLE BIAS IN FAVOUR OF BEAUTY HE WAS THE HUSBAND OF A VERY SILLY WOMAN BUT SHE KNEW THAT THIS KIND OF BLUNDER WAS TOO COMMON FOR ANY SENSIBLE MAN TO BE LASTINGLY HURT BY IT
