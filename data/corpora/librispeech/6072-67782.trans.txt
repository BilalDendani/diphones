6072-67782-0000 CHAPTER TWO AN INVESTMENT ANYWAY THE NATURAL RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS WAS THAT MISS BELINDA WAS MOVED TO SHED A FEW TEARS I HOPE YOU WILL EXCUSE MY BEING TOO STARTLED TO SAY I WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU SHE SAID
6072-67782-0001 I HAVE NOT SEEN MY BROTHER FOR THIRTY YEARS AND I WAS VERY FOND OF HIM HE SAID YOU WERE ANSWERED OCTAVIA AND HE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO
6072-67782-0002 AND THEN HE THOUGHT HE WOULD WAIT UNTIL HE COULD COME HOME AND SURPRISE YOU HE WAS AWFULLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN HE HAD TO GO BACK WITHOUT SEEING YOU POOR DEAR MARTIN WEPT MISS BELINDA GENTLY SUCH A JOURNEY OCTAVIA OPENED HER CHARMING EYES IN SURPRISE
6072-67782-0003 AND HE DOESN'T MIND THE JOURNEY THE JOURNEY IS NOTHING YOU KNOW NOTHING ECHOED MISS BELINDA A VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC NOTHING WHEN ONE THINKS OF THE DANGER MY DEAR OCTAVIA'S EYES OPENED A SHADE WIDER
6072-67782-0004 WE HAVE MADE THE TRIP TO THE STATES ACROSS THE ISTHMUS TWELVE TIMES AND THAT TAKES A MONTH SHE REMARKED SO WE DON'T THINK TEN DAYS MUCH TWELVE TIMES SAID MISS BELINDA QUITE APPALLED DEAR DEAR DEAR
6072-67782-0005 AND FOR SOME MOMENTS SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT LOOK AT HER YOUNG RELATIVE IN DOUBTFUL WONDER SHAKING HER HEAD WITH ACTUAL SADNESS BUT SHE FINALLY RECOVERED HERSELF WITH A LITTLE START WHAT AM I THINKING OF SHE EXCLAIMED REMORSEFULLY TO LET YOU SIT HERE IN THIS WAY
6072-67782-0006 PRAY EXCUSE ME MY DEAR YOU SEE I AM SO UPSET SHE LEFT HER CHAIR IN A GREAT HURRY AND PROCEEDED TO EMBRACE HER YOUNG GUEST TENDERLY THOUGH WITH A LITTLE TIMOROUSNESS
6072-67782-0007 DID I UPSET YOU SHE INQUIRED CALMLY THE FACT WAS THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE WHY THE SIMPLE ADVENT OF A RELATIVE FROM NEVADA SHOULD SEEM TO HAVE THE EFFECT OF AN EARTHQUAKE AND RESULT IN TREMOR CONFUSION AND TEARS
6072-67782-0008 IT WAS TRUE SHE HERSELF HAD SHED A TEAR OR SO BUT THEN HER TROUBLES HAD BEEN ACCUMULATING FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND SHE HAD NOT FELT CONFUSED YET
6072-67782-0009 AND LEFT HER GUEST ALONE THAT YOUNG PERSON GLANCED ABOUT HER WITH A RATHER DUBIOUS EXPRESSION IT IS A QUEER NICE LITTLE PLACE SHE SAID BUT I DON'T WONDER THAT PA EMIGRATED IF THEY ALWAYS GET INTO SUCH A FLURRY ABOUT LITTLE THINGS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GHOST
6072-67782-0010 THEN SHE PROCEEDED TO UNLOCK THE BIG TRUNK AND ATTIRE HERSELF DOWN STAIRS MISS BELINDA WAS WAVERING BETWEEN THE KITCHEN AND THE PARLOR IN A KINDLY FLUTTER TOAST SOME MUFFINS MARY ANNE AND BRING IN THE COLD ROAST FOWL SHE SAID
6072-67782-0011 AND I WILL PUT OUT SOME STRAWBERRY JAM AND SOME OF THE PRESERVED GINGER DEAR ME JUST TO THINK HOW FOND OF PRESERVED GINGER POOR MARTIN WAS AND HOW LITTLE OF IT HE WAS ALLOWED TO EAT
6072-67782-0012 THERE REALLY SEEMS A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE IN MY HAVING SUCH A NICE STOCK OF IT IN THE HOUSE WHEN HIS DAUGHTER COMES HOME IN THE COURSE OF HALF AN HOUR EVERY THING WAS IN READINESS AND THEN MARY ANNE WHO HAD BEEN SENT UP STAIRS TO ANNOUNCE THE FACT
6072-67782-0013 CAME DOWN IN A MOST REMARKABLE STATE OF DELIGHTED AGITATION SUPPRESSED ECSTASY AND AMAZEMENT EXCLAIMING ALOUD IN EVERY FEATURE SHE'S DRESSED MUM SHE ANNOUNCED AN LL BE DOWN IMMEDIATE AND RETIRED TO A SHADOWY CORNER OF THE KITCHEN PASSAGE
6072-67782-0014 THAT SHE MIGHT LIE IN WAIT UNOBSERVED MISS BELINDA SITTING BEHIND THE TEA SERVICE HEARD A SOFT FLOWING SILKEN RUSTLE SWEEPING DOWN THE STAIRCASE AND ACROSS THE HALL AND THEN HER NIECE ENTERED DON'T YOU THINK I'VE DRESSED PRETTY QUICK SHE SAID
6072-67782-0015 AND SWEPT ACROSS THE LITTLE PARLOR AND SAT DOWN IN HER PLACE WITH THE CALMEST AND MOST UNCONSCIOUS AIR IN THE WORLD THERE WAS IN SLOWBRIDGE BUT ONE DRESSMAKING ESTABLISHMENT THE HEAD OF THE ESTABLISHMENT MISS LETITIA CHICKIE
6072-67782-0016 THERE WERE LEGENDS THAT SHE RECEIVED HER PATTERNS FROM LONDON AND MODIFIED THEM TO SUIT THE SLOWBRIDGE TASTE POSSIBLY THIS WAS TRUE BUT IN THAT CASE HER LABORS AS MODIFIER MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERE INDEED
6072-67782-0017 SINCE THEY WERE SO FAR MODIFIED AS TO BE ALTOGETHER UNRECOGNIZABLE WHEN THEY LEFT MISS CHICKIE'S ESTABLISHMENT AND WERE BORNE HOME IN TRIUMPH TO THE HOUSES OF HER PATRONS THE TASTE OF SLOWBRIDGE WAS QUIET UPON THIS SLOWBRIDGE PRIDED ITSELF ESPECIALLY
6072-67782-0018 AND AT THE SAME TIME TENDED TOWARD ECONOMY WHEN GORES CAME INTO FASHION SLOWBRIDGE CLUNG FIRMLY AND WITH SOME PRIDE TO SUBSTANTIAL BREADTHS WHICH DID NOT CUT GOOD SILK INTO USELESS STRIPS WHICH COULD NOT BE UTILIZED IN AFTER TIME
6072-67782-0019 AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN AFTER A VISIT TO LONDON LADY THEOBALD WALKED INTO SAINT JAMES'S ONE SUNDAY WITH TWO GORES ON EACH SIDE THAT MISS CHICKIE REGRETFULLY PUT SCISSORS INTO HER FIRST BREADTH
6072-67782-0020 EACH MATRONLY MEMBER OF GOOD SOCIETY POSSESSED A SUBSTANTIAL SILK GOWN OF SOME SOBER COLOR WHICH GOWN HAVING DONE DUTY AT TWO YEARS TEA PARTIES DESCENDED TO THE GRADE OF SECOND BEST
6072-67782-0021 AND WERE WORN DURING THE LATTER HALF OF ANY FESTIVE OCCASION IN A FLABBY AND HOPELESS CONDITION MISS CHICKIE MADE THE MUSLINS FESTOONING AND ADORNING THEM AFTER DESIGNS EMANATING FROM HER FERTILE IMAGINATION
6072-67782-0022 IF THEY WERE A LITTLE SHORT IN THE BODY AND NOT VERY GENEROUSLY PROPORTIONED IN THE MATTER OF TRAIN THERE WAS NO RIVAL ESTABLISHMENT TO SNEER AND MISS CHICKIE HAD IT ALL HER OWN WAY AND AT LEAST IT COULD NEVER BE SAID THAT SLOWBRIDGE WAS VULGAR OR OVERDRESSED
6072-67782-0023 JUDGE THEN OF MISS BELINDA BASSETT'S CONDITION OF MIND WHEN HER FAIR RELATIVE TOOK HER SEAT BEFORE HER WHAT THE MATERIAL OF HER NIECE'S DRESS WAS MISS BELINDA COULD NOT HAVE TOLD IT WAS A SILKEN AND SOFT FABRIC OF A PALE BLUE COLOR
6072-67782-0024 IT CLUNG TO THE SLENDER LISSOME YOUNG FIGURE LIKE A GLOVE A FAN LIKE TRAIN OF GREAT LENGTH ALMOST COVERED THE HEARTH RUG THERE WERE PLAITINGS AND FRILLINGS ALL OVER IT AND YARDS OF DELICATE SATIN RIBBON CUT INTO LOOPS IN THE MOST RECKLESSLY EXTRAVAGANT MANNER
6072-67782-0025 MISS BELINDA SAW ALL THIS AT THE FIRST GLANCE AS MARY ANNE HAD SEEN IT AND LIKE MARY ANNE LOST HER BREATH BUT ON HER SECOND GLANCE SHE SAW SOMETHING MORE ON THE PRETTY SLIGHT HANDS WERE THREE WONDERFUL SPARKLING RINGS
6072-67782-0026 COMPOSED OF DIAMONDS SET IN CLUSTERS THERE WERE GREAT SOLITAIRES IN THE NEAT LITTLE EARS AND THE THICKLY PLAITED LACE AT THE THROAT WAS FASTENED BY A DIAMOND CLASP MY DEAR SAID MISS BELINDA CLUTCHING HELPLESSLY AT THE TEAPOT ARE YOU
6072-67782-0027 SURELY IT IS A A LITTLE DANGEROUS TO WEAR SUCH SUCH PRICELESS ORNAMENTS ON ORDINARY OCCASIONS OCTAVIA STARED AT HER FOR A MOMENT UNCOMPREHENDINGLY YOUR JEWELS I MEAN MY LOVE FLUTTERED MISS BELINDA SURELY YOU DON'T WEAR THEM OFTEN
6072-67782-0028 I DECLARE IT QUITE FRIGHTENS ME TO THINK OF HAVING SUCH THINGS IN THE HOUSE DOES IT SAID OCTAVIA THAT'S QUEER AND SHE LOOKED PUZZLED FOR A MOMENT AGAIN THEN SHE GLANCED DOWN AT HER RINGS I NEARLY ALWAYS WEAR THESE SHE REMARKED FATHER GAVE THEM TO ME
6072-67782-0029 HE SAYS DIAMONDS ARE AN INVESTMENT ANYWAY AND I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE THEM THESE TOUCHING THE EAR RINGS AND CLASP WERE GIVEN TO MY MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS ON THE STAGE A LOT OF PEOPLE CLUBBED TOGETHER AND BOUGHT THEM FOR HER SHE WAS A GREAT FAVORITE
6072-67782-0030 MISS BELINDA MADE ANOTHER CLUTCH AT THE HANDLE OF THE TEAPOT YOUR MOTHER SHE EXCLAIMED FAINTLY ON THE
6072-67782-0031 ANSWERED OCTAVIA SAN FRANCISCO FATHER MARRIED HER THERE SHE WAS AWFULLY PRETTY I DON'T REMEMBER HER SHE DIED WHEN I WAS BORN SHE WAS ONLY NINETEEN THE UTTER CALMNESS AND FREEDOM FROM EMBARRASSMENT WITH WHICH THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE MADE
6072-67782-0032 ALMOST SHOOK MISS BELINDA'S FAITH IN HER OWN IDENTITY STRANGE TO SAY UNTIL THIS MOMENT SHE HAD SCARCELY GIVEN A THOUGHT TO HER BROTHER'S WIFE AND TO FIND HERSELF SITTING IN HER OWN GENTEEL LITTLE PARLOR BEHIND HER OWN TEA SERVICE WITH HER HAND UPON HER OWN TEAPOT
6072-67782-0033 HEARING THAT THIS WIFE HAD BEEN A YOUNG PERSON WHO HAD BEEN A GREAT FAVORITE UPON THE STAGE IN A REGION PEOPLED AS SHE HAD BEEN LED TO SUPPOSE BY GOLD DIGGERS AND ESCAPED CONVICTS WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR HER TO SUPPORT HERSELF UNDER BUT SHE DID SUPPORT HERSELF BRAVELY
6072-67782-0034 WHEN SHE HAD TIME TO RALLY HELP YOURSELF TO SOME FOWL MY DEAR SHE SAID HOSPITABLY EVEN THOUGH VERY FAINTLY INDEED AND TAKE A MUFFIN OCTAVIA DID SO HER OVER SPLENDID HANDS FLASHING IN THE LIGHT AS SHE MOVED THEM
6072-67782-0035 AMERICAN GIRLS ALWAYS HAVE MORE THINGS THAN ENGLISH GIRLS SHE OBSERVED WITH ADMIRABLE COOLNESS THEY DRESS MORE I HAVE BEEN TOLD SO BY GIRLS WHO HAVE BEEN IN EUROPE AND I HAVE MORE THINGS THAN MOST AMERICAN GIRLS FATHER HAD MORE MONEY THAN MOST PEOPLE
6072-67782-0036 THAT WAS ONE REASON AND HE SPOILED ME I SUPPOSE HE HAD NO ONE ELSE TO GIVE THINGS TO AND HE SAID I SHOULD HAVE EVERY THING I TOOK A FANCY TO HE OFTEN LAUGHED AT ME FOR BUYING THINGS BUT HE NEVER SAID I SHOULDN'T BUY THEM HE WAS ALWAYS GENEROUS SIGHED MISS BELINDA
6072-67782-0037 POOR DEAR MARTIN OCTAVIA SCARCELY ENTERED INTO THE SPIRIT OF THIS MOURNFUL SYMPATHY SHE WAS FOND OF HER FATHER BUT HER RECOLLECTIONS OF HIM WERE NOT PATHETIC OR SENTIMENTAL HE TOOK ME WITH HIM WHEREVER HE WENT SHE PROCEEDED
6072-67782-0038 AND WE HAD A TEACHER FROM THE STATES WHO TRAVELLED WITH US SOMETIMES
