6625-73085-0000 THE ENVOY SO I END THIS COMPACT STATEMENT OF THE RENASCENT RELIGION WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE CRYSTALLISING OUT OF THE INTELLECTUAL SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL CONFUSIONS OF THIS TIME IT IS AN ACCOUNT RENDERED
6625-73085-0001 HAVE TRANSFERRED THE STATEMENTS OF SCIENCE INTO RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY REJECTED OBSOLESCENT DEFINITIONS AND RE COORDINATED PROPOSITIONS THAT HAD DRIFTED INTO OPPOSITION THUS I SEE IDEAS ARE DEVELOPING AND THUS HAVE I WRITTEN THEM DOWN
6625-73085-0002 IT IS A SECONDARY MATTER THAT I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS TREND OF INTELLIGENT OPINION IS A DISCOVERY OF TRUTH THE READER IS TOLD OF MY OWN BELIEF MERELY TO AVOID AN AFFECTATION OF IMPARTIALITY AND ALOOFNESS
6625-73085-0003 THE THEOGONY HERE SET FORTH IS ANCIENT ONE CAN TRACE IT APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING
6625-73085-0004 OF MANY DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF SPECULATION THE CONCEPTION OF GOD AS FINITE IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED VERY ILLUMINATINGLY IN RECENT YEARS IN THE WORK OF ONE I AM HAPPY TO WRITE OF AS MY FRIEND AND MASTER THAT VERY GREAT AMERICAN THE LATE WILLIAM JAMES
6625-73085-0005 INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO HIM TOWARDS THE END OF HIS LIFE AND IT IS THE MOST RELEASING IDEA IN THE SYSTEM ONLY IN THE MOST GENERAL TERMS CAN I TRACE THE OTHER ORIGINS OF THESE PRESENT VIEWS I DO NOT THINK MODERN RELIGION
6625-73085-0006 OWES MUCH TO WHAT IS CALLED DEISM OR THEISM THE RATHER ABSTRACT AND FUTILE DEISM OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
6625-73085-0007 WHO BORED THE FRIENDS OF ROBESPIERRE WAS A STERILE THING IT HAS LITTLE RELATION TO THESE MODERN DEVELOPMENTS IT CONCEIVED OF GOD AS AN INFINITE BEING OF NO PARTICULAR CHARACTER WHEREAS
6625-73085-0008 ON THE OTHER HAND MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SET THEMSELVES WITH UNAVOIDABLE THEOLOGICAL PRECONCEPTIONS IT IS TRUE TO SPECULATE UPON THE ACTUAL TEACHINGS AND QUALITY OF CHRIST HAVE PRODUCED INTERPRETATIONS
6625-73085-0009 THAT HAVE INTERWOVEN INSENSIBLY WITH THOUGHTS MORE APPARENTLY NEW THERE IS A CURIOUS MODERNITY ABOUT VERY MANY OF CHRIST'S RECORDED SAYINGS REVIVED RELIGION HAS ALSO NO DOUBT
6625-73085-0010 RELIGION THUS RESTATED MUST I THINK PRESENTLY INCORPORATE GREAT SECTIONS OF THOUGHT THAT ARE STILL ATTACHED TO FORMAL CHRISTIANITY THE TIME IS AT HAND WHEN MANY OF THE ORGANISED CHRISTIAN CHURCHES
6625-73085-0011 THEIR POSITIONS EITHER IN TERMS THAT WILL IDENTIFY THEM WITH THIS RENASCENCE OR THAT WILL LEAD TO THE RELEASE
6625-73085-0012 ITS PROBABLE OBLIGATIONS TO EASTERN THOUGHT ARE LESS READILY ESTIMATED BY A EUROPEAN WRITER MODERN RELIGION HAS NO REVELATION AND NO FOUNDER IT IS THE PRIVILEGE AND POSSESSION OF NO COTERIE OF DISCIPLES OR EXPONENTS
6625-73085-0013 IT IS APPEARING SIMULTANEOUSLY ROUND AND ABOUT THE WORLD EXACTLY AS A CRYSTALLISING SUBSTANCE APPEARS HERE AND THERE IN A SUPER SATURATED SOLUTION IT IS A PROCESS OF TRUTH GUIDED BY THE DIVINITY IN MEN
6625-73085-0014 IT NEEDS NO OTHER GUIDANCE AND NO PROTECTION IT NEEDS NOTHING BUT FREEDOM FREE SPEECH AND HONEST STATEMENT OUT OF THE MOST MIXED AND IMPURE SOLUTIONS A GROWING CRYSTAL IS INFALLIBLY ABLE TO SELECT ITS SUBSTANCE
6625-73085-0015 AND PURE OUT OF A DARK MATRIX OF STRUCTURELESS CONFUSION THIS METAPHOR OF CRYSTALLISATION IS PERHAPS THE BEST SYMBOL OF THE ADVENT AND GROWTH OF THE NEW UNDERSTANDING IT HAS NO CHURCH NO AUTHORITIES NO TEACHERS NO ORTHODOXY
6625-73085-0016 IT DOES NOT EVEN THRUST AND STRUGGLE AMONG THE OTHER THINGS SIMPLY IT GROWS CLEAR THERE WILL BE NO PUTTING AN END TO IT IT ARRIVES INEVITABLY
6625-73085-0017 NOOR IT IS A MOUNTAIN OF LIGHT GROWING AND INCREASING IT IS AN ALL PERVADING LUCIDITY A BRIGHTNESS AND CLEARNESS IT HAS NO HEAD TO SMITE NO BODY YOU CAN DESTROY IT OVERLEAPS ALL BARRIERS IT BREAKS OUT IN DESPITE OF EVERY ENCLOSURE
6625-73085-0018 IT WILL COMPEL ALL THINGS TO ORIENT THEMSELVES TO IT IT COMES AS THE DAWN COMES THROUGH WHATEVER CLOUDS AND MISTS MAY BE HERE OR WHATEVER SMOKE AND CURTAINS MAY BE THERE
