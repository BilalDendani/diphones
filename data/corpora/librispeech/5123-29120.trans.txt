5123-29120-0001 THERE WERE MANY OTHERS IN WASHINGTON ON THE SAME ERRAND SOME OF THEM WITH CLAIMS AS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH AS HIS A CONCERT OF ACTION WAS NECESSARY
5123-29120-0002 AND HE WAS NOT THEREFORE AT ALL SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THE NOTE FROM A LADY ASKING HIM TO CALL AT SENATOR DILWORTHY'S AT A LITTLE AFTER THREE ON WEDNESDAY HE RANG THE BELL OF THE SENATOR'S RESIDENCE
5123-29120-0003 IT WAS A HANDSOME MANSION ON THE SQUARE OPPOSITE THE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE THE OWNER MUST BE A MAN OF GREAT WEALTH THE COLONEL THOUGHT PERHAPS WHO KNOWS SAID HE WITH A SMILE
5123-29120-0004 HE MAY HAVE GOT SOME OF MY COTTON IN EXCHANGE FOR SALT AND QUININE AFTER THE CAPTURE OF NEW ORLEANS AS THIS THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND HE WAS LOOKING AT THE REMARKABLE FIGURE OF THE HERO OF NEW ORLEANS
5123-29120-0005 HOLDING ITSELF BY MAIN STRENGTH FROM SLIDING OFF THE BACK OF THE REARING BRONZE HORSE AND LIFTING ITS HAT IN THE MANNER OF ONE WHO ACKNOWLEDGES THE PLAYING OF THAT MARTIAL AIR SEE THE CONQUERING HERO COMES GAD SAID THE COLONEL TO HIMSELF
5123-29120-0006 BUT THEY'D HAVE TO TIE HIM ON LAURA WAS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE HEARD THE BELL SHE HEARD THE STEPS IN THE HALL AND THE EMPHATIC THUD OF THE SUPPORTING CANE
5123-29120-0007 SHE HAD RISEN FROM HER CHAIR AND WAS LEANING AGAINST THE PIANO PRESSING HER LEFT HAND AGAINST THE VIOLENT BEATING OF HER HEART THE DOOR OPENED AND THE COLONEL ENTERED STANDING IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE OPPOSITE WINDOW
5123-29120-0008 LAURA WAS MORE IN THE SHADOW AND STOOD FOR AN INSTANT LONG ENOUGH FOR THE COLONEL TO MAKE THE INWARD OBSERVATION THAT SHE WAS A MAGNIFICENT WOMAN SHE THEN ADVANCED A STEP COLONEL SELBY IS IT NOT
5123-29120-0009 THE COLONEL STAGGERED BACK CAUGHT HIMSELF BY A CHAIR AND TURNED TOWARDS HER A LOOK OF TERROR LAURA MY GOD YES YOUR WIFE OH NO IT CAN'T BE

5123-29120-0011 LAURA IN HER PASSION WAS HURRIED ON TO SAY NO MAN HAD EVER ACCUSED COLONEL SELBY OF COWARDICE BUT HE WAS A COWARD BEFORE THIS WOMAN MAY BE HE WAS NOT THE MAN HE ONCE WAS
5123-29120-0012 WHERE WAS HIS COOLNESS WHERE WAS HIS SNEERING IMPERTURBABLE MANNER
5123-29120-0013 IF HE HAD ONLY BEEN FOREWARNED
5123-29120-0014 THAT HE MUST GAIN TIME THERE WAS DANGER IN LAURA'S TONE THERE WAS SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL IN HER CALMNESS HER STEADY EYES SEEMED TO DEVOUR HIM YOU HAVE RUINED MY LIFE SHE SAID
5123-29120-0015 AND I WAS SO YOUNG SO IGNORANT AND LOVED YOU SO
5123-29120-0016 A SOILED CAST OFF YOU MIGHT BETTER HAVE KILLED ME THEN THEN I SHOULD NOT HAVE HATED YOU LAURA SAID THE COLONEL NERVING HIMSELF BUT STILL PALE AND SPEAKING APPEALINGLY DON'T SAY THAT
5123-29120-0017 REPROACH ME I DESERVE IT I WAS A SCOUNDREL I WAS EVERYTHING MONSTROUS BUT YOUR BEAUTY MADE ME CRAZY YOU ARE RIGHT I WAS A BRUTE IN LEAVING YOU AS I DID
5123-29120-0018 BUT WHAT COULD I DO I WAS MARRIED AND AND YOUR WIFE STILL LIVES ASKED LAURA BENDING A LITTLE FORWARD IN HER EAGERNESS THE COLONEL NOTICED THE ACTION AND HE ALMOST SAID NO
5123-29120-0019 BUT HE THOUGHT OF THE FOLLY OF ATTEMPTING CONCEALMENT YES SHE IS HERE WHAT LITTLE COLOR HAD WANDERED BACK INTO LAURA'S FACE FORSOOK IT AGAIN
5123-29120-0020 HER HEART STOOD STILL HER STRENGTH SEEMED GOING FROM HER LIMBS HER LAST HOPE WAS GONE THE ROOM SWAM BEFORE HER FOR A MOMENT AND THE COLONEL STEPPED TOWARDS HER BUT SHE WAVED HIM BACK
5123-29120-0021 AS HOT ANGER AGAIN COURSED THROUGH HER VEINS AND SAID AND YOU DARE COME WITH HER HERE AND TELL ME OF IT HERE AND MOCK ME WITH IT AND YOU THINK I WILL HAVE IT GEORGE YOU THINK I WILL LET YOU LIVE WITH THAT WOMAN
5123-29120-0022 YOU THINK I AM AS POWERLESS AS THAT DAY I FELL DEAD AT YOUR FEET SHE RAGED NOW SHE WAS IN A TEMPEST OF EXCITEMENT AND SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM WITH A THREATENING MIEN SHE WOULD KILL ME IF SHE COULD
5123-29120-0023 THOUGHT THE COLONEL BUT HE THOUGHT AT THE SAME MOMENT HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS HE HAD RECOVERED HIS HEAD NOW SHE WAS LOVELY WHEN HE KNEW HER THEN A SIMPLE COUNTRY GIRL NOW SHE WAS DAZZLING
5123-29120-0024 IN THE FULLNESS OF RIPE WOMANHOOD A SUPERB CREATURE WITH ALL THE FASCINATION THAT A WOMAN OF THE WORLD HAS FOR SUCH A MAN AS COLONEL SELBY NOTHING OF THIS WAS LOST ON HIM HE STEPPED QUICKLY TO HER
5123-29120-0025 LAURA STOP THINK SUPPOSE I LOVED YOU YET SUPPOSE I HATED MY FATE WHAT CAN I DO I AM BROKEN BY THE WAR I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING ALMOST
5123-29120-0026 I HAD AS LIEF BE DEAD AND DONE WITH IT THE COLONEL SPOKE WITH A LOW REMEMBERED VOICE THAT THRILLED THROUGH LAURA HE WAS LOOKING INTO HER EYES AS HE HAD LOOKED IN THOSE OLD DAYS
5123-29120-0027 HE WAS WOUNDED HE HAD BEEN PUNISHED HER STRENGTH FORSOOK HER WITH HER RAGE AND SHE SANK UPON A CHAIR SOBBING OH MY GOD I THOUGHT I HATED HIM
5123-29120-0028 THE COLONEL KNELT BESIDE HER HE TOOK HER HAND AND SHE LET HIM KEEP IT SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO HIS FACE WITH A PITIABLE TENDERNESS AND SAID IN A WEAK VOICE
5123-29120-0029 THE COLONEL VOWED AND PROTESTED HE KISSED HER HAND AND HER LIPS HE SWORE HIS FALSE SOUL INTO PERDITION SHE WANTED LOVE THIS WOMAN
5123-29120-0030 WAS NOT HER LOVE FOR GEORGE SELBY DEEPER THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN'S COULD BE HAD SHE NOT A RIGHT TO HIM DID HE NOT BELONG TO HER BY VIRTUE OF HER OVERMASTERING PASSION HIS WIFE
5123-29120-0031 SHE WAS NOT HIS WIFE EXCEPT BY THE LAW SHE COULD NOT BE EVEN WITH THE LAW SHE COULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO STAND BETWEEN TWO SOULS THAT WERE ONE IT WAS AN INFAMOUS CONDITION IN SOCIETY THAT GEORGE SHOULD BE TIED TO HER
5123-29120-0032 LAURA THOUGHT THIS BELIEVED IT BECAUSE SHE DESIRED TO BELIEVE IT
5123-29120-0033 THE REQUIREMENTS OF HER OWN NATURE SHE MAY HAVE HEARD DOUBTLESS SHE HAD SIMILAR THEORIES THAT WERE PREVALENT AT THAT DAY THEORIES OF THE TYRANNY OF MARRIAGE AND OF THE FREEDOM OF MARRIAGE
5123-29120-0034 SHE HAD EVEN HEARD WOMEN LECTURERS SAY THAT MARRIAGE SHOULD ONLY CONTINUE SO LONG AS IT PLEASED EITHER PARTY TO IT FOR A YEAR OR A MONTH OR A DAY SHE HAD NOT GIVEN MUCH HEED TO THIS
5123-29120-0035 BUT SHE SAW ITS JUSTICE NOW IN A DASH OF REVEALING DESIRE IT MUST BE RIGHT GOD WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HER TO LOVE GEORGE SELBY AS SHE DID AND HIM TO LOVE HER IF IT WAS RIGHT FOR SOCIETY TO RAISE UP A BARRIER BETWEEN THEM
5123-29120-0036 HE BELONGED TO HER HAD HE NOT CONFESSED IT HIMSELF NOT EVEN THE RELIGIOUS ATMOSPHERE OF SENATOR DILWORTHY'S HOUSE HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO INSTILL INTO LAURA THAT DEEP CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE
5123-29120-0037 WHICH HAD BEEN SOMEHOW OMITTED IN HER TRAINING INDEED IN THAT VERY HOUSE HAD SHE NOT HEARD WOMEN PROMINENT BEFORE THE COUNTRY AND BESIEGING CONGRESS UTTER SENTIMENTS THAT FULLY JUSTIFIED THE COURSE SHE WAS MARKING OUT FOR HERSELF
5123-29120-0038 THEY WERE SEATED NOW SIDE BY SIDE TALKING WITH MORE CALMNESS LAURA WAS HAPPY OR THOUGHT SHE WAS
5123-29120-0039 AND IS AT THE MOMENT RECOGNIZED AS FLEETING AND PERILOUS AND INDULGED TREMBLINGLY SHE LOVED SHE WAS LOVED THAT IS HAPPINESS CERTAINLY
5123-29120-0040 AND THE BLACK PAST AND THE TROUBLED PRESENT AND THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE COULD NOT SNATCH THAT FROM HER WHAT DID THEY SAY AS THEY SAT THERE WHAT NOTHINGS DO PEOPLE USUALLY SAY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
5123-29120-0041 EVEN IF THEY ARE THREE SCORE AND TEN IT WAS ENOUGH FOR LAURA TO HEAR HIS VOICE AND BE NEAR HIM IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE NEAR HER AND AVOID COMMITTING HIMSELF AS MUCH AS HE COULD
5123-29120-0042 ENOUGH FOR HIM WAS THE PRESENT ALSO HAD THERE NOT ALWAYS BEEN SOME WAY OUT OF SUCH SCRAPES AND YET LAURA COULD NOT BE QUITE CONTENT WITHOUT PRYING INTO TOMORROW
5123-29120-0043 HOW COULD THE COLONEL MANAGE TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS WIFE WOULD IT BE LONG COULD HE NOT GO INTO SOME STATE WHERE IT WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH TIME HE COULD NOT SAY EXACTLY THAT THEY MUST THINK OF
5123-29120-0044 THAT THEY MUST TALK OVER AND SO ON DID THIS SEEM LIKE A DAMNABLE PLOT TO LAURA AGAINST THE LIFE MAYBE OF A SISTER A WOMAN LIKE HERSELF PROBABLY NOT
5123-29120-0045 IT WAS RIGHT THAT THIS MAN SHOULD BE HERS AND THERE WERE SOME OBSTACLES IN THE WAY THAT WAS ALL
5123-29120-0046 TO THOSE WHO COMMIT THEM WHEN ONE HAS BROKEN THE TENTH COMMANDMENT THE OTHERS ARE NOT OF MUCH ACCOUNT WAS IT UNNATURAL THEREFORE THAT WHEN GEORGE SELBY DEPARTED LAURA SHOULD WATCH HIM FROM THE WINDOW
5123-29120-0047 WITH AN ALMOST JOYFUL HEART AS HE WENT DOWN THE SUNNY SQUARE I SHALL SEE HIM TO MORROW SHE SAID AND THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT HE IS MINE NOW DAMN THE WOMAN
5123-29120-0048 SAID THE COLONEL AS HE PICKED HIS WAY DOWN THE STEPS OR HE ADDED AS HIS THOUGHTS TOOK A NEW TURN
