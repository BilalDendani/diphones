7346-91900-0000 HAS RETAINED THE THRONE OF TARTARUS THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN MORE LUCKY THAN THEIR BROTHER JUPITER WHO HAD TO SUFFER SPECIALLY THE VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE THIS THIRD SON OF SATURN WHO AFTER THE FALL OF HIS SIRE ASSUMED THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE HEAVENS
7346-91900-0001 REIGNED FOR A LONG SERIES OF YEARS ON THE SUMMIT OF OLYMPUS
7346-91900-0002 THEIR CELESTIAL LADIES OF THE BEDCHAMBER AND MAIDS OF HONOR WHO ALL LED A JOYOUS LIFE REPLETE WITH AMBROSIA AND NECTAR
7346-91900-0003 ALAS WHEN THE REIGN OF THE CROSS THE EMPIRE OF SUFFERING WAS PROCLAIMED THE SUPREME CHRONIDE EMIGRATED AND DISAPPEARED AMIDST THE TUMULT OF THE BARBARIAN TRIBES WHICH INVADED THE ROMAN WORLD ALL TRACES OF THE EX GOD WERE LOST
7346-91900-0004 AND I HAVE QUESTIONED IN VAIN OLD CHRONICLES AND OLD WOMEN NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO FURNISH ME WITH ANY INFORMATION AS TO HIS DESTINY I HAVE BURROWED IN MANY A LIBRARY WHERE I MADE THEM BRING ME THE MOST MAGNIFICENT CODEX
7346-91900-0005 ENRICHED WITH GOLD AND JEWELS VERITABLE ODALISQUES IN THE HAREM OF SCIENCE AND AS IS THE CUSTOM I HERE RENDER MY PUBLIC THANKS TO THE ERUDITE EUNUCHS WHO WITHOUT TOO MUCH GRUMBLING AND SOMETIMES EVEN WITH AFFABILITY
7346-91900-0006 HAVE GIVEN ME ACCESS TO THESE LUMINOUS TREASURES CONFIDED TO THEIR CARE I AM NOW CONVINCED THAT THE MIDDLE AGES HAVE NOT BEQUEATHED TO US ANY TRADITIONS CONCERNING THE FATE OF JUPITER AFTER THE FALL OF PAGANISM
7346-91900-0007 IS THE HISTORY TOLD ME LONG AGO BY MY FRIEND NIELS ANDERSEN I HAVE JUST MENTIONED NIELS ANDERSEN AND THIS GOOD FIGURE AT ONCE SO DROLL AND SO LOVABLE
7346-91900-0008 I MUST DEVOTE A FEW LINES TO HIM HERE FOR THE REST I LIKE TO INDICATE MY AUTHORITIES AND TO SHOW THEIR GOOD OR BAD QUALITIES IN ORDER THAT THE READER MAY BE IN A POSITION TO JUDGE HIMSELF HOW FAR THESE AUTHORITIES DESERVE TO BE TRUSTED
7346-91900-0009 NIELS ANDERSEN BORN AT DRONTHEIM IN NORWAY WAS ONE OF THE MOST SKILFUL AND INTREPID WHALERS I HAVE EVER KNOWN IT IS TO HIM THAT I AM INDEBTED FOR WHAT KNOWLEDGE I HAVE OF THE WHALE FISHERY
7346-91900-0010 HE TAUGHT ME ALL THE SUBTLETIES OF THE ART HE MADE ME ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE STRATAGEMS AND DODGES WHICH THE INTELLIGENT ANIMAL EMPLOYS TO BAFFLE THESE SUBTLE SNARES AND MAKE ITS ESCAPE IT WAS NIELS ANDERSEN WHO TAUGHT ME THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HARPOON
7346-91900-0011 HE SHOWED ME HOW YOU SHOULD FIX THE KNEE OF THE RIGHT LEG AGAINST THE GUN WHALE OF THE BOAT WHEN LAUNCHING THE HARPOON AND HOW WITH THE LEFT LEG YOU LAUNCH A VIGOROUS KICK AT THE IMBECILE SAILOR WHO DON'T PAY OUT QUICKLY ENOUGH THE ROPE ATTACHED TO THE HARPOON TO HIM I OWE ALL
7346-91900-0012 AND IF I HAVE NOT BECOME A FAMOUS WHALER THE FAULT RESTS NEITHER WITH NIELS ANDERSEN NOR WITH MYSELF BUT WITH MY EVIL STAR WHICH HAS NEVER ALLOWED ME IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE TO ENCOUNTER ANY WHALE WITH WHICH I MIGHT HAVE ENGAGED IN HONORABLE COMBAT
7346-91900-0013 I HAVE ONLY ENCOUNTERED VULGAR STOCKFISH AND MISERABLE HERRINGS OF WHAT USE IS THE BEST HARPOON WHEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH A HERRING NOW THAT MY LIMBS ARE PARALYSED I MUST RENOUNCE FOR EVER THE HOPE OF PURSUING WHALES
7346-91900-0014 WHEN AT RITZEBUTTEL NEAR CUXHAVEN I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF NIELS ANDERSEN HE WAS SCARCELY MORE NIMBLE HIMSELF FOR OFF THE COAST OF SENEGAL A YOUNG SHARK WHICH NO DOUBT TOOK HIS RIGHT LEG FOR A STICK OF BARLEY SUGAR HAD SNAPPED IT OFF
7346-91900-0015 WITH A SNAP OF HIS TEETH SINCE THEN POOR NIELS ANDERSEN WENT LIMPING UPON AN ARTIFICIAL LEG MANUFACTURED FROM ONE OF THE FIRS OF HIS COUNTRY AND WHICH HE EXTOLLED AS A MASTERPIECE OF NORWEGIAN CARPENTRY HIS GREATEST PLEASURE AT THIS PERIOD
7346-91900-0016 ON THE BELLY OF WHICH HE DRUMMED AWAY WITH HIS WOODEN LEG I OFTEN HELPED HIM TO CLIMB UPON THIS BARREL BUT SOMETIMES WHEN HE WISHED TO GET DOWN AGAIN I WOULD NOT GIVE HIM MY HELP EXCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT HE TOLD ME ONE OF HIS CURIOUS TRADITIONS OF THE ARCTIC SEA
7346-91900-0017 SO NIELS ANDERSEN PREFACED ALL HIS NARRATIVES WITH A PANEGYRICAL ENUMERATION OF THE QUALITIES OF THE WHALE HE OF COURSE COMMENCED WITH SUCH A PANEGYRIC THE LEGEND WE GIVE HERE THE WHALE HE SAID
7346-91900-0018 IS NOT ONLY THE LARGEST BUT ALSO THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OF ANIMALS
7346-91900-0019 MOREOVER THIS BEAST IS SYMPATHETIC HE HAS A GOOD CHARACTER AND MUCH TASTE FOR CONJUGAL LIFE IT IS A TOUCHING SIGHT HE ADDED TO SEE A FAMILY OF WHALES GROUPED AROUND ITS VENERABLE PATRIARCH AND COUCHED UPON AN ENORMOUS MASS OF ICE BASKING IN THE SUN
7346-91900-0020 AND AT LENGTH ALL PLUNGE INTO THE SEA TO PLAY AT HIDE AND SEEK AMONG THE IMMENSE ICE BLOCKS THE PURITY OF MANNERS AND THE CHASTITY OF THE WHALES SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED LESS TO MORAL PRINCIPLES
7346-91900-0021 NOR CAN IT UNHAPPILY BE DENIED WENT ON NIELS ANDERSON THAT THEY HAVE NOT ANY PIOUS SENTIMENT THAT THEY ARE TOTALLY DEVOID OF RELIGION I BELIEVE THIS IS AN ERROR I CRIED INTERRUPTING MY FRIEND
7346-91900-0022 I HAVE LATELY READ THE REPORT OF A DUTCH MISSIONARY WHEREIN HE DESCRIBES THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE CREATION
7346-91900-0023 WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM REVEALS ITSELF EVEN IN THE POLAR REGIONS AT THE HOUR OF SUNRISE AND WHEN THE TEAMS OF DAY TRANSFIGURING THE GIGANTIC ROCKS OF ICE MAKE THEM RESEMBLE THOSE CASTLES OF DIAMONDS WE READ OF IN FAIRY TALES
7346-91900-0024 ALL THIS BEAUTY OF THE CREATION IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE GOOD DOMINIE IS A PROOF OF THE POWER OF GOD WHICH INFLUENCES EVERY LIVING CREATURE SO THAT NOT ONLY MAN BUT LIKEWISE A GREAT BRUTE OF A FISH RAVISHED BY THIS SPECTACLE ADORES THE CREATOR
7346-91900-0025 AND ADDRESSES TO HIM ITS PRAYERS THE DOMINIE ASSURES US THAT HE HAS SEEN WITH HIS OWN EYES A WHALE WHICH HELD ITSELF ERECT AGAINST THE WALL OF A BLOCK OF ICE AND SWAYED THE UPPER PART OF ITS BODY AS MEN DO IN PRAYER NIELS ANDERSEN ADMITTED
7346-91900-0026 PROPPING THEMSELVES AGAINST A CLIFF OF ICE INDULGED IN MOVEMENTS VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE WE REMARK IN THE ORATORIES OF THE VARIOUS RELIGIOUS SECTS
7346-91900-0027 HE EXPLAINED IT ON PHYSIOLOGICAL GROUNDS HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE WHALE THIS CHIMBORAZO OF ANIMALS
7346-91900-0028 HAS BENEATH ITS SKIN STRATA OF FAT OF A DEPTH SO PRODIGIOUS THAT A SINGLE WHALE OFTEN FURNISHES A HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BARRELS OF TALLOW AND OIL THESE LAYERS OF FAT ARE SO THICK THAT WHILE THE COLOSSUS SLEEPS
7346-91900-0029 HUNDREDS OF WATER RATS CAN COME AND SETTLE IN IT
7346-91900-0030 IMMENSELY LARGER AND MORE VORACIOUS THAN THE RATS OF THE MAINLAND LEAD JOYOUS LIFE UNDER THE SKIN OF THE WHALE
7346-91900-0031 WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO QUIT THEIR HOLES THESE BANQUETS OF VERMIN AT LENGTH TROUBLE THEIR INVOLUNTARY HOST AND EVEN CAUSE HIM EXCESSIVE SUFFERINGS NOT HAVING HANDS AS WE HAVE WHO GOD BE THANKED CAN SCRATCH OURSELVES WHEN WE FEEL AN ITCHING
7346-91900-0032 THE WHALE TRIES TO MITIGATE HIS PANGS BY PLACING HIMSELF AGAINST THE PROTRUDING AND SHARP ANGLES OF A ROCK OF ICE AND BY THERE RASPING HIS BACK WITH A REAL FERVOR AND WITH VIGOROUS MOVEMENTS UP AND DOWN
7346-91900-0033 AS WE SEE THE DOGS RASPING THEIR SKIN AGAINST A BED POST WHEN THE FLEAS BITE THEM OVERMUCH NOW IN THESE MOVEMENTS THE GOOD DOMINIE THOUGHT HE SAW THE EDIFYING ACT OF PRAYER AND HE ATTRIBUTED TO DEVOTION THE JERKINGS OCCASIONED BY THE ORGIES OF THE RATS
7346-91900-0034 ENORMOUS AS IS THE QUANTITY OF OIL IN THE WHALE IT HAS NOT THE LEAST RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT IT IS ONLY AMONG ANIMALS OF MEDIOCRE STATURE THAT WE FIND ANY RELIGION THE VERY GREAT THE CREATURES GIGANTIC LIKE THE WHALE ARE NOT ENDOWED WITH IT
7346-91900-0035 WHAT CAN BE THE REASON IS IT THAT THEY CANNOT FIND A CHURCH SUFFICIENTLY SPACIOUS TO AFFORD THEM ENTRANCE INTO ITS PALE NOR HAVE THE WHALES ANY TASTE FOR THE PROPHETS AND THE ONE WHICH SWALLOWED JONAH WAS NOT ABLE TO DIGEST THAT GREAT PREACHER
7346-91900-0036 SEIZED WITH NAUSEA IT VOMITED HIM AFTER THREE DAYS MOST CERTAINLY THAT PROVES THE ABSENCE OF ALL RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT IN THESE MONSTERS THE WHALE THEREFORE WOULD NEVER CHOOSE AN ICE BLOCK FOR PRAYER CUSHION
7346-91900-0037 AND SWAY ITSELF IN ATTITUDES OF DEVOTION IT ADORES AS LITTLE THE TRUE GOD WHO RESIDES ABOVE THERE IN HEAVEN AS THE FALSE PAGAN GOD WHO DWELLS NEAR THE ARCTIC POLE IN THE ISLE OF THE RABBITS WHERE THE DEAR BEAST GOES SOMETIMES TO PAY HIM A VISIT
7346-91900-0038 WHAT IS THIS ISLE OF RABBITS I ASKED NIELS ANDERSEN DRUMMING ON THE BARREL WITH HIS WOODEN LEG HE ANSWERED IT IS EXACTLY IN THIS ISLE THAT THE EVENTS TOOK PLACE OF WHICH I AM GOING TO TELL YOU
7346-91900-0039 SINCE ITS FIRST DISCOVERY NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO VISIT IT AGAIN THE ENORMOUS MOUNTAINS OF ICE ACCUMULATED AROUND IT BAR THE APPROACH ONCE ONLY HAS IT BEEN VISITED
7346-91900-0040 AND THAT WAS MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THESE SAILORS REACHED IT WITH THEIR SHIP THEY FOUND IT DESERTED AND UNCULTIVATED SICKLY STALKS OF BROOM SWAYED SADLY UPON THE QUICKSANDS
7346-91900-0041 HERE AND THERE WERE SCATTERED SOME DWARF SHRUBS AND STUNTED FIRS CROUCHING ON THE STERILE SOIL RABBITS RAN ABOUT EVERYWHERE IN GREAT NUMBERS AND THIS IS THE REASON THE SAILORS CALL THE ISLET THE ISLE OF RABBITS
7346-91900-0042 A CABIN THE ONLY ONE THEY DISCOVERED ANNOUNCED THE PRESENCE OF A HUMAN BEING WHEN THE MARINERS HAD ENTERED THE HUT THEY SAW AN OLD MAN
7346-91900-0043 AND MISERABLY MUFFLED IN RABBIT SKINS HE WAS SEATED UPON A STONE SETTLE AND WARMED HIS THIN HANDS AND TREMBLING KNEES AT THE GRATE WHERE SOME BRUSHWOOD WAS BURNING AT HIS RIGHT HAND STOOD A MONSTROUSLY LARGE BIRD WHICH SEEMED TO BE AN EAGLE
7346-91900-0044 BUT THE MOULTING OF TIME HAD SO CRUELLY STRIPPED IT THAT ONLY THE GREAT STIFF MAIN PLUMES OF ITS WINGS WERE LEFT SO THAT THE ASPECT OF THIS NAKED ANIMAL WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLY UGLY
7346-91900-0045 ON THE LEFT OF THE OLD MAN WAS COUCHED UPON THE GROUND AN AGED BALD SKINNED SHE GOT YET WITH A GENTLE LOOK AND WHICH IN SPITE OF ITS GREAT AGE HAD THE DUGS SWOLLEN WITH MILK AND THE TEATS FRESH AND ROSY
7346-91900-0046 AMONG THE SAILORS WHO HAD LANDED ON THE ISLE OF RABBITS THERE WERE SOME GREEKS AND ONE OF THESE THINKING THAT THE MAN OF THE HUT COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIS TONGUE SAID TO HIS COMRADES IN GREEK
7346-91900-0047 THIS QUEER OLD FELLOW MUST BE EITHER A GHOST OR AN EVIL SPIRIT AT THESE WORDS THE OLD MAN TREMBLED AND ROSE SUDDENLY FROM HIS SEAT AND THE SAILORS TO THEIR GREAT ASTONISHMENT SAW A LOFTY AND IMPOSING FIGURE
7346-91900-0048 WHICH WITH IMPERIOUS AND EVEN MAJESTIC DIGNITY HELD ITSELF ERECT IN SPITE OF THE WEIGHT OF YEARS SO THAT THE HEAD REACHED THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF HIS LINEAMENTS THOUGH WORN AND RAVAGED CONSERVED TRACES OF BEAUTY
7346-91900-0049 THEY WERE NOBLE AND PERFECTLY REGULAR THIN LOCKS OF SILVER HAIR FELL UPON THE FOREHEAD WRINKLED BY PRIDE AND BY AGE HIS EYES THOUGH GLAZED AND LUSTRELESS
7346-91900-0050 THESE WORDS RESONANT AND HARMONIOUS
7346-91900-0051 I AM AN UNFORTUNATE WHO HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS BUT YOU WHAT ARE YOU AT THIS DEMAND THE SEAMEN ACQUAINTED THEIR HOST WITH THE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD DRIVEN THEM OUT OF THEIR COURSE AND THEY BEGGED HIM TO TELL THEM ALL ABOUT THE ISLE
7346-91900-0052 BUT THE OLD MAN COULD GIVE THEM BUT SCANT INFORMATION
7346-91900-0053 OF WHICH THE RAMPARTS OF ICE OFFERED HIM A SURE REFUGE AGAINST HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMIES WHO HAD USURPED HIS LEGITIMATE RIGHTS
7346-91900-0054 THAT EVERY YEAR AT THE SEASON WHEN THE FLOATING ICE BLOCKS FORMED A COMPACT MASS TROOPS OF SAVAGES IN SLEDGES VISITED HIM WHO IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS RABBIT SKINS GAVE HIM ALL SORTS OF ARTICLES MOST NECESSARY TO LIFE
7346-91900-0055 WERE HIS FAVORITE SOCIETY NEVERTHELESS HE ADDED THAT HE FELT MUCH PLEASURE AT THIS MOMENT IN SPEAKING HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE BEING GREEK BY BIRTH HE BEGGED HIS COMPATRIOTS TO INFORM HIM AS TO THE THEN STATE OF GREECE HE LEARNT WITH A MALICIOUS JOY BADLY DISSIMULATED
7346-91900-0056 HE SHOWED LESS SATISFACTION WHEN THEY TOLD HIM THAT THIS CHRISTIAN SYMBOL HAD BEEN REPLACED BY THE CRESCENT THE MOST SINGULAR THING WAS THAT NONE OF THE SEAMEN KNEW THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS CONCERNING WHICH HE QUESTIONED THEM AND WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM HAD BEEN FLOURISHING CITIES IN HIS TIME
7346-91900-0057 ON THE OTHER HAND THE NAMES BY WHICH THE SEAMEN DESIGNATED THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES OF MODERN GREECE WERE COMPLETELY UNKNOWN TO HIM AND THE OLD MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD OFTEN AS IF QUITE OVERWHELMED AND THE SAILORS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH WONDER
7346-91900-0058 THEY SAW WELL THAT HE KNEW PERFECTLY THE LOCALITIES OF THE COUNTRY
7346-91900-0059 FOR HE DESCRIBED CLEARLY AND EXACTLY THE GULFS THE PENINSULAS THE CAPES OFTEN EVEN THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT HILLS AND ISOLATED GROUPS OF ROCKS HIS IGNORANCE OF THE COMMONEST TYPOGRAPHICAL NAMES THEREFORE ASTONISHED THEM ALL THE MORE
7346-91900-0060 THE OLD MAN ASKED WITH THE MOST LIVELY INTEREST AND EVEN WITH A CERTAIN ANXIETY ABOUT AN ANCIENT TEMPLE WHICH HE SAID HAD BEEN OF OLD THE GRANDEST IN ALL GREECE NONE OF HIS HEARERS RECOGNISED THE NAME WHICH HE PRONOUNCED WITH TENDER EMOTION AT LAST
7346-91900-0061 WHEN HE HAD MINUTELY DESCRIBED THE PLACE WHERE THIS MONUMENT STOOD A YOUNG SEAMAN SUDDENLY RECOGNISED THE SPOT THE VILLAGE WHERE I WAS BORN HE EXCLAIMED IS SITUATED PRECISELY THERE DURING MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE LONG WATCHED THERE THE PIGS OF MY FATHER
7346-91900-0062 ON THIS SITE THERE ARE IN FACT THE RUINS OF VERY ANCIENT CONSTRUCTIONS WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY MAGNIFICENT HERE AND THERE YOU SEE SOME COLUMNS STILL ERECT THEY ARE ISOLATED OR CONNECTED BY FRAGMENTS OF ROOFING
7346-91900-0063 WHENCE HANG TENDRILS OF HONEYSUCKLE AND RED BIND WEEDS OTHER COLUMNS SOME OF THEM RED MARBLE LIE FRACTURED ON THE GRASS THE IVY HAS INVADED THEIR SUPERB CAPITALS FORMED OF FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE DELICATELY CHISELLED
7346-91900-0064 GREAT SLABS OF MARBLE SQUARED FRAGMENTS OF WALL AND TRIANGULAR PIECES OF ROOFING ARE SCATTERED ABOUT HALF BURIED IN THE EARTH I HAVE OFTEN CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN PASSED HOURS AT A TIME IN EXAMINING THE COMBATS AND THE GAMES
7346-91900-0065 THE DANCES AND THE PROCESSIONS THE BEAUTIFUL AND LUDICROUS FIGURES WHICH ARE SCULPTURED THERE UNFORTUNATELY THESE SCULPTURES ARE MUCH INJURED BY TIME AND ARE COVERED WITH MOSS AND CREEPERS MY FATHER WHOM I ONCE ASKED WHAT THESE RUINS WERE
7346-91900-0066 OF OLD INHABITED BY A PAGAN GOD
7346-91900-0067 BUT WHO WAS MOREOVER GUILTY OF INCEST AND OTHER INFAMOUS VICES THAT IN THEIR BLINDNESS THE IDOLATORS HAD NEVERTHELESS IMMOLATED OXEN
7346-91900-0068 MY FATHER ASSURED ME THAT WE STILL SAW THE MARBLE BASIN WHEREIN THEY HAD GATHERED THE BLOOD OF THE VICTIMS
7346-91900-0069 AND IN WHICH I ALSO PRESERVED THE REFUSE WHICH MY ANIMALS DEVOURED WITH SO MUCH APPETITE WHEN THE YOUNG SAILOR HAD THUS SPOKEN THE OLD MAN GAVE A DEEP SIGH OF THE MOST BITTER ANGUISH HE SANK NERVELESS UPON THE STONE SEAT
7346-91900-0070 AND HIDING HIS VISAGE IN HIS HANDS WEPT LIKE A CHILD THE BIRD AT HIS SIDE EMITTED TERRIBLE CRIES SPREAD ITS ENORMOUS WINGS AND MENACED THE STRANGERS WITH TALONS AND BEAK
7346-91900-0071 THE SHE GOAT MOANED AND LICKED THE HANDS OF HER MASTER WHOSE SORROWS SHE SEEMED TRYING TO COMFORT BY HER HUMBLE CARESSES AT THIS SIGHT A STRANGE TROUBLE SWELLED IN THE HEARTS OF THE SEAMEN THEY HASTILY QUITTED THE HUT
7346-91900-0072 AND DID NOT FEEL AT EASE UNTIL THEY COULD NO MORE HEAR THE SOBBINGS OF THE OLD MAN THE CROAKINGS OF THE HIDEOUS BIRD AND THE BLEATINGS OF THE GOAT WHEN THEY GOT ON BOARD THEIR VESSEL AGAIN THEY RELATED THEIR ADVENTURES AMONG THE CREW THERE CHANCED TO BE A SCHOLAR
7346-91900-0073 WHO DECLARED THAT IT WAS AN EVENT OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE APPLYING WITH A SAGACIOUS AIR HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER TO HIS NOSE HE ASSURED THE SEAMEN THAT THE OLD MAN OF THE ISLE OF RABBITS WAS BEYOND ALL DOUBT THE ANCIENT GOD JUPITER
7346-91900-0074 SON OF SATURN AND RHEA ONCE SOVEREIGN LORD OF THE GODS
7346-91900-0075 WAS EVIDENTLY THE FAMOUS EAGLE WHICH USED TO BEAR THE THUNDERBOLTS IN ITS TALONS AND THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY THE GOAT WAS THE OLD NURSE AMALTHEA WHICH HAD OF OLD SUCKLED THE GOD IN THE ISLE OF CRETE
7346-91900-0076 AND WHICH NOW CONTINUED TO NOURISH HIM WITH ITS MILK IN THE ISLE OF RABBITS SUCH WAS THE HISTORY OF NIELS ANDERSEN AND IT MADE MY HEART BLEED I WILL NOT DISSEMBLE
7346-91900-0077 ALREADY HIS REVELATIONS CONCERNING THE SECRET SUFFERINGS OF THE WHALE HAD PROFOUNDLY SADDENED ME POOR ANIMAL AGAINST THIS VILE MOB OF RATS WHICH HOUSE THEMSELVES IN YOUR BODY AND GNAW YOU INCESSANTLY
7346-91900-0078 NO REMEDY AVAILS AND YOU CARRY THEM ABOUT WITH YOU TO THE END OF YOUR DAYS RUSH AS YOU WILL TO THE NORTH AND TO THE SOUTH
7346-91900-0079 BUT PAINED AS I HAD BEEN BY THE OUTRAGE WREAKED UPON THE POOR WHALES MY SOUL WAS INFINITELY MORE TROUBLED BY THE TRAGICAL FATE OF THIS OLD MAN WHO ACCORDING TO THE MYTHOLOGICAL THEORY OF THE LEARNED RUSSIAN
7346-91900-0080 WAS THE HERETOFORE KING OF THE GODS JUPITER THE CHRONIDE YES HE
7346-91900-0081 FROM WHICH NOT THE IMMORTALS THEMSELVES CAN ESCAPE AND THE SPECTACLE OF SUCH CALAMITIES HORRIFIES US IN FILLING US WITH PITY AND INDIGNATION BE JUPITER BE THE SOVEREIGN LORD OF THE WORLD
7346-91900-0082 BE ADORED BY A HUNDRED NATIONS DURING LONG CENTURIES BE THE LOVER OF SEMELE OF DANAE OF EUROPA OF ALCMENA
7346-91900-0083 AND AFTER ALL NOTHING WILL REMAIN AT THE END BUT A DECREPIT OLD MAN WHO TO GAIN HIS MISERABLE LIVELIHOOD HAS TO TURN DEALER IN RABBIT SKINS LIKE ANY POOR SAVOYARD
7346-91900-0084 SUCH A SPECTACLE WILL NO DOUBT GIVE PLEASURE TO THE VILE MULTITUDE WHICH INSULTS TO DAY THAT WHICH IT ADORED YESTERDAY PERHAPS AMONG THESE WORTHY PEOPLE ARE TO BE FOUND SOME OF THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE UNLUCKY BULLS WHICH WERE OF OLD IMMOLATED IN HECATOMBS
7346-91900-0085 UPON THE ALTAR OF JUPITER LET SUCH REJOICE IN HIS FALL AND MOCK HIM AT THEIR EASE IN REVENGE FOR THE BLOOD OF THEIR ANCESTORS VICTIMS OF IDOLATRY AS FOR ME
