3592-173545-0000 THAT IS TILL THE EVE OF THE ENEMY'S ENTRY INTO THE CITY AFTER PETYA HAD JOINED OBOLENSKI'S REGIMENT OF COSSACKS AND LEFT FOR BELAYA TSERKOV WHERE THAT REGIMENT WAS FORMING
3592-173545-0001 THE COUNTESS WAS SEIZED WITH TERROR THE THOUGHT THAT BOTH HER SONS WERE AT THE WAR HAD BOTH GONE FROM UNDER HER WING THAT TODAY OR TOMORROW EITHER OR BOTH OF THEM MIGHT BE KILLED LIKE THE THREE SONS OF ONE OF HER ACQUAINTANCES
3592-173545-0002 STRUCK HER THAT SUMMER FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH CRUEL CLEARNESS SHE TRIED TO GET NICHOLAS BACK AND WISHED TO GO HERSELF TO JOIN PETYA OR TO GET HIM AN APPOINTMENT SOMEWHERE IN PETERSBURG
3592-173545-0003 BUT NEITHER OF THESE PROVED POSSIBLE PETYA COULD NOT RETURN UNLESS HIS REGIMENT DID SO OR UNLESS HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER REGIMENT ON ACTIVE SERVICE NICHOLAS WAS SOMEWHERE WITH THE ARMY
3592-173545-0004 AND HAD NOT SENT A WORD SINCE HIS LAST LETTER IN WHICH HE HAD GIVEN A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HIS MEETING WITH PRINCESS MARY THE COUNTESS DID NOT SLEEP AT NIGHT OR WHEN SHE DID FALL ASLEEP DREAMED THAT SHE SAW HER SONS LYING DEAD
3592-173545-0005 AFTER MANY CONSULTATIONS AND CONVERSATIONS THE COUNT AT LAST DEVISED MEANS TO TRANQUILLIZE HER HE GOT PETYA TRANSFERRED FROM OBOLENSKI'S REGIMENT TO BEZUKHOV'S WHICH WAS IN TRAINING NEAR MOSCOW
3592-173545-0006 THOUGH PETYA WOULD REMAIN IN THE SERVICE THIS TRANSFER WOULD GIVE THE COUNTESS THE CONSOLATION OF SEEING AT LEAST ONE OF HER SONS UNDER HER WING AND SHE HOPED TO ARRANGE MATTERS FOR HER PETYA
3592-173545-0007 SO AS NOT TO LET HIM GO AGAIN BUT ALWAYS GET HIM APPOINTED TO PLACES WHERE HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY TAKE PART IN A BATTLE AS LONG AS NICHOLAS ALONE WAS IN DANGER THE COUNTESS IMAGINED THAT SHE LOVED HER FIRST BORN
3592-173545-0008 MORE THAN ALL HER OTHER CHILDREN AND EVEN REPROACHED HERSELF FOR IT BUT WHEN HER YOUNGEST THE SCAPEGRACE WHO HAD BEEN BAD AT LESSONS WAS ALWAYS BREAKING THINGS IN THE HOUSE AND MAKING HIMSELF A NUISANCE TO EVERYBODY
3592-173545-0009 THAT SNUB NOSED PETYA WITH HIS MERRY BLACK EYES AND FRESH ROSY CHEEKS WHERE SOFT DOWN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW WHEN HE WAS THROWN AMID THOSE BIG DREADFUL CRUEL MEN WHO WERE FIGHTING SOMEWHERE
3592-173545-0010 ABOUT SOMETHING AND APPARENTLY FINDING PLEASURE IN IT THEN HIS MOTHER THOUGHT SHE LOVED HIM MORE MUCH MORE THAN ALL HER OTHER CHILDREN THE NEARER THE TIME CAME FOR PETYA TO RETURN THE MORE UNEASY GREW THE COUNTESS
3592-173545-0011 SHE BEGAN TO THINK SHE WOULD NEVER LIVE TO SEE SUCH HAPPINESS THE PRESENCE OF SONYA OF HER BELOVED NATASHA OR EVEN OF HER HUSBAND IRRITATED HER
3592-173545-0012 WHAT DO I WANT WITH THEM I WANT NO ONE BUT PETYA SHE THOUGHT AT THE END OF AUGUST THE ROSTOVS RECEIVED ANOTHER LETTER FROM NICHOLAS HE WROTE FROM THE PROVINCE
3592-173545-0013 OF VORONEZH WHERE HE HAD BEEN SENT TO PROCURE REMOUNTS BUT THAT LETTER DID NOT SET THE COUNTESS AT EASE KNOWING THAT ONE SON WAS OUT OF DANGER SHE BECAME THE MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT PETYA
3592-173545-0014 THOUGH BY THE TWENTIETH OF AUGUST NEARLY ALL THE ROSTOVS ACQUAINTANCES HAD LEFT MOSCOW AND THOUGH EVERYBODY TRIED TO PERSUADE THE COUNTESS TO GET AWAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
3592-173545-0015 HER ADORED PETYA RETURNED ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST HE ARRIVED THE PASSIONATE TENDERNESS WITH WHICH HIS MOTHER RECEIVED HIM DID NOT PLEASE THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD OFFICER
3592-173545-0016 THOUGH SHE CONCEALED FROM HIM HER INTENTION OF KEEPING HIM UNDER HER WING PETYA GUESSED HER DESIGNS AND INSTINCTIVELY FEARING THAT HE MIGHT GIVE WAY TO EMOTION WHEN WITH HER MIGHT BECOME WOMANISH AS HE TERMED IT TO HIMSELF
3592-173545-0017 HE TREATED HER COLDLY AVOIDED HER AND DURING HIS STAY IN MOSCOW ATTACHED HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO NATASHA FOR WHOM HE HAD ALWAYS HAD A PARTICULARLY BROTHERLY TENDERNESS ALMOST LOVER LIKE
3592-173545-0018 OWING TO THE COUNT'S CUSTOMARY CARELESSNESS NOTHING WAS READY FOR THEIR DEPARTURE BY THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST
3592-173545-0019 TO REMOVE THEIR HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS DID NOT ARRIVE TILL THE THIRTIETH FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTH TILL THE THIRTY FIRST ALL MOSCOW WAS IN A BUSTLE AND COMMOTION
3592-173545-0020 EVERY DAY THOUSANDS OF MEN WOUNDED AT BORODINO WERE BROUGHT IN BY THE DOROGOMILOV GATE AND TAKEN TO VARIOUS PARTS OF MOSCOW AND THOUSANDS OF CARTS CONVEYED THE INHABITANTS
3592-173545-0021 AND THEIR POSSESSIONS OUT BY THE OTHER GATES IN SPITE OF ROSTOPCHIN'S BROADSHEETS OR BECAUSE OF THEM OR INDEPENDENTLY OF THEM THE STRANGEST AND MOST CONTRADICTORY RUMORS WERE CURRENT IN THE TOWN
3592-173545-0022 SOME SAID THAT NO ONE WAS TO BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE CITY OTHERS ON THE CONTRARY SAID THAT ALL THE ICONS HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE CHURCHES AND EVERYBODY WAS TO BE ORDERED TO LEAVE
3592-173545-0023 SOME SAID THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BATTLE AFTER BORODINO AT WHICH THE FRENCH HAD BEEN ROUTED WHILE OTHERS ON THE CONTRARY REPORTED THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY HAD BEEN DESTROYED
3592-173545-0024 SOME TALKED ABOUT THE MOSCOW MILITIA WHICH PRECEDED BY THE CLERGY WOULD GO TO THE THREE HILLS OTHERS WHISPERED THAT AUGUSTIN HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO LEAVE
3592-173545-0025 THAT TRAITORS HAD BEEN SEIZED THAT THE PEASANTS WERE RIOTING AND ROBBING PEOPLE ON THEIR WAY FROM MOSCOW AND SO ON BUT ALL THIS WAS ONLY TALK IN REALITY
3592-173545-0026 AT WHICH IT WAS DECIDED TO ABANDON MOSCOW HAD NOT YET BEEN HELD BOTH THOSE WHO WENT AWAY AND THOSE WHO REMAINED BEHIND FELT THOUGH THEY DID NOT SHOW IT THAT MOSCOW WOULD CERTAINLY BE ABANDONED
3592-173545-0027 AND THAT THEY OUGHT TO GET AWAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND SAVE THEIR BELONGINGS IT WAS FELT THAT EVERYTHING WOULD SUDDENLY BREAK UP AND CHANGE BUT UP TO THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER NOTHING HAD DONE SO
3592-173545-0028 AS A CRIMINAL WHO IS BEING LED TO EXECUTION KNOWS THAT HE MUST DIE IMMEDIATELY BUT YET LOOKS ABOUT HIM AND STRAIGHTENS THE CAP THAT IS AWRY ON HIS HEAD
3592-173545-0029 SO MOSCOW INVOLUNTARILY CONTINUED ITS WONTED LIFE THOUGH IT KNEW THAT THE TIME OF ITS DESTRUCTION WAS NEAR WHEN THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE TO WHICH ITS PEOPLE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SUBMIT
3592-173545-0030 WOULD BE COMPLETELY UPSET DURING THE THREE DAYS PRECEDING THE OCCUPATION OF MOSCOW THE WHOLE ROSTOV FAMILY WAS ABSORBED IN VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY COUNT ILYA ROSTOV
3592-173545-0031 CONTINUALLY DROVE ABOUT THE CITY COLLECTING THE CURRENT RUMORS FROM ALL SIDES AND GAVE SUPERFICIAL AND HASTY ORDERS AT HOME ABOUT THE PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR DEPARTURE
3592-173545-0032 THE COUNTESS WATCHED THE THINGS BEING PACKED WAS DISSATISFIED WITH EVERYTHING WAS CONSTANTLY IN PURSUIT OF PETYA WHO WAS ALWAYS RUNNING AWAY FROM HER AND WAS JEALOUS OF NATASHA
3592-173545-0033 WITH WHOM HE SPENT ALL HIS TIME SONYA ALONE DIRECTED THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF MATTERS BY GETTING THINGS PACKED BUT OF LATE SONYA HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY SAD AND SILENT
3592-173545-0034 IN WHICH HE MENTIONED PRINCESS MARY HAD ELICITED IN HER PRESENCE JOYOUS COMMENTS FROM THE COUNTESS WHO SAW AN INTERVENTION OF PROVIDENCE IN THIS MEETING OF THE PRINCESS AND NICHOLAS
3592-173545-0035 I WAS NEVER PLEASED AT BOLKONSKI'S ENGAGEMENT TO NATASHA SAID THE COUNTESS BUT I ALWAYS WANTED NICHOLAS TO MARRY THE PRINCESS AND HAD A PRESENTIMENT THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN WHAT A GOOD THING IT WOULD BE
3592-173545-0036 SONYA FELT THAT THIS WAS TRUE THAT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY OF RETRIEVING THE ROSTOVS AFFAIRS WAS BY NICHOLAS MARRYING A RICH WOMAN AND THAT THE PRINCESS WAS A GOOD MATCH
3592-173545-0037 IT WAS VERY BITTER FOR HER BUT DESPITE HER GRIEF OR PERHAPS JUST BECAUSE OF IT SHE TOOK ON HERSELF ALL THE DIFFICULT WORK OF DIRECTING THE STORING AND PACKING OF THEIR THINGS AND WAS BUSY FOR WHOLE DAYS
3592-173545-0038 THE COUNT AND COUNTESS TURNED TO HER WHEN THEY HAD ANY ORDERS TO GIVE PETYA AND NATASHA ON THE CONTRARY FAR FROM HELPING THEIR PARENTS
3592-173545-0039 ALMOST ALL DAY LONG THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH THEIR RUNNING FEET THEIR CRIES AND THEIR SPONTANEOUS LAUGHTER THEY LAUGHED AND WERE GAY NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS ANY REASON TO LAUGH
3592-173545-0040 BUT BECAUSE GAIETY AND MIRTH WERE IN THEIR HEARTS AND SO EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WAS A CAUSE FOR GAIETY AND LAUGHTER TO THEM PETYA WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS BECAUSE HAVING LEFT HOME A BOY HE HAD RETURNED
3592-173545-0041 AS EVERYBODY TOLD HIM A FINE YOUNG MAN BECAUSE HE WAS AT HOME BECAUSE HE HAD LEFT BELAYA TSERKOV WHERE THERE WAS NO HOPE OF SOON TAKING PART IN A BATTLE AND HAD COME TO MOSCOW WHERE THERE WAS TO BE FIGHTING
3592-173545-0042 IN A FEW DAYS AND CHIEFLY BECAUSE NATASHA WHOSE LEAD HE ALWAYS FOLLOWED WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS NATASHA WAS GAY BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG AND NOW NOTHING REMINDED HER
3592-173545-0043 OF THE CAUSE OF HER SADNESS AND BECAUSE SHE WAS FEELING WELL SHE WAS ALSO HAPPY BECAUSE SHE HAD SOMEONE TO ADORE HER THE ADORATION OF OTHERS WAS A LUBRICANT THE WHEELS OF HER MACHINE NEEDED
3592-173545-0044 TO MAKE THEM RUN FREELY AND PETYA ADORED HER ABOVE ALL THEY WERE GAY BECAUSE THERE WAS A WAR NEAR MOSCOW THERE WOULD BE FIGHTING AT THE TOWN GATES ARMS WERE BEING GIVEN OUT
3592-173545-0045 EVERYBODY WAS ESCAPING GOING AWAY SOMEWHERE AND IN GENERAL SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WAS HAPPENING AND THAT IS ALWAYS EXCITING
