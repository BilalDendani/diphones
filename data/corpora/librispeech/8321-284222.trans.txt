8321-284222-0016 IT BROUGHT A FAINT HOPE THAT HER FATHER'S CABIN MIGHT YET BE SAVED DOWN THE STONE STEPS SHE WENT HOLDING OUT THE PAPERS
8321-284222-0017 BUT DON'T HOPE TOO MUCH IT WILL BE VERY HARD FOR ME TO MAKE SCARSBURG BY FIVE O'CLOCK BUT FOR JULIE'S SAKE I'LL DO MY BEST FOR JULIE'S SAKE
8321-284222-0018 THE WORDS DRIFTED BACK TO JANE AS SHE STOOD WATCHING THE PONY HURTLING ITSELF DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD UNTIL THE CLOUD OF DUST HID IT FROM VIEW SHE JANE HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING FOR JULIE'S SAKE
8321-284222-0019 WHY HE RISKED HIS HEALTH THAT I MIGHT FINISH MY COURSE IN THAT SEMINARY WHERE EVERYONE EVERYTHING CONSPIRED TO MAKE ME MORE PROUD AND HELPLESS THEN BEFORE HER AROSE A MENTAL PICTURE MEG CLEAR EYED EAGER TO BE OF SERVICE IN AN HOUR OF NEED

8321-284222-0021 UNABLE TO SIT STILL
8321-284222-0022 JANE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND BECAUSE SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING SHE HAD ENTIRELY LOST INTEREST IN HER BOOK SHE WANDERED OUT INTO THE KITCHEN SHE SAW ON THE TABLE A PAN OF POTATOES WITH THE PARING KNIFE NEAR HARDLY KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT
8321-284222-0023 WHEN SHE HEARD HIM HALLOOING FROM THE BROOK PLACING THE PAN ON THE STEP SHE RAN TO MEET HIM
