409-124990-0000 CHAPTER FOUR OF THE LIMITS TO THE AUTHORITY OF SOCIETY OVER THE INDIVIDUAL WHAT THEN IS THE RIGHTFUL LIMIT TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL OVER HIMSELF
409-124990-0001 HOW MUCH OF HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALITY AND HOW MUCH TO SOCIETY EACH WILL RECEIVE ITS PROPER SHARE IF EACH HAS THAT WHICH MORE PARTICULARLY CONCERNS IT
409-124990-0002 TO INDIVIDUALITY SHOULD BELONG THE PART OF LIFE IN WHICH IT IS CHIEFLY THE INDIVIDUAL THAT IS INTERESTED TO SOCIETY THE PART WHICH CHIEFLY INTERESTS SOCIETY THOUGH SOCIETY IS NOT FOUNDED ON A CONTRACT
409-124990-0003 EVERY ONE WHO RECEIVES THE PROTECTION OF SOCIETY OWES A RETURN FOR THE BENEFIT AND THE FACT OF LIVING IN SOCIETY RENDERS IT INDISPENSABLE THAT EACH SHOULD BE BOUND TO OBSERVE A CERTAIN LINE OF CONDUCT TOWARDS THE REST THIS CONDUCT CONSISTS FIRST
409-124990-0004 TO BE FIXED ON SOME EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE OF THE LABOURS AND SACRIFICES INCURRED FOR DEFENDING THE SOCIETY OR ITS MEMBERS FROM INJURY AND MOLESTATION THESE CONDITIONS SOCIETY IS JUSTIFIED IN ENFORCING AT ALL COSTS TO THOSE WHO ENDEAVOUR TO WITHHOLD FULFILMENT
409-124990-0005 AS SOON AS ANY PART OF A PERSON'S CONDUCT AFFECTS PREJUDICIALLY THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS SOCIETY HAS JURISDICTION OVER IT AND THE QUESTION WHETHER THE GENERAL WELFARE WILL OR WILL NOT BE PROMOTED BY INTERFERING WITH IT BECOMES OPEN TO DISCUSSION
409-124990-0006 BUT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ENTERTAINING ANY SUCH QUESTION WHEN A PERSON'S CONDUCT AFFECTS THE INTERESTS OF NO PERSONS BESIDES HIMSELF OR NEEDS NOT AFFECT THEM UNLESS THEY LIKE
409-124990-0007 WHEN THE PERIOD OF EDUCATION IS PAST THE SELF REGARDING VIRTUES SHOULD BE INCULCATED HUMAN BEINGS OWE TO EACH OTHER HELP TO DISTINGUISH THE BETTER FROM THE WORSE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO CHOOSE THE FORMER AND AVOID THE LATTER
409-124990-0008 THEY SHOULD BE FOR EVER STIMULATING EACH OTHER TO INCREASED EXERCISE OF THEIR HIGHER FACULTIES AND INCREASED DIRECTION OF THEIR FEELINGS AND AIMS TOWARDS WISE INSTEAD OF FOOLISH ELEVATING INSTEAD OF DEGRADING OBJECTS AND CONTEMPLATIONS
409-124990-0009 BUT NEITHER ONE PERSON NOR ANY NUMBER OF PERSONS IS WARRANTED IN SAYING TO ANOTHER HUMAN CREATURE OF RIPE YEARS THAT HE SHALL NOT DO WITH HIS LIFE FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT WHAT HE CHOOSES TO DO WITH IT HE IS THE PERSON MOST INTERESTED IN HIS OWN WELL BEING
409-124990-0010 AND EVEN IF RIGHT ARE AS LIKELY AS NOT TO BE MISAPPLIED TO INDIVIDUAL CASES
409-124990-0011 MERELY FROM WITHOUT IN THIS DEPARTMENT THEREFORE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS INDIVIDUALITY HAS ITS PROPER FIELD OF ACTION IN THE CONDUCT OF HUMAN BEINGS TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER IT IS NECESSARY THAT GENERAL RULES SHOULD FOR THE MOST PART BE OBSERVED
409-124990-0012 IN ORDER THAT PEOPLE MAY KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO EXPECT BUT IN EACH PERSON'S OWN CONCERNS HIS INDIVIDUAL SPONTANEITY IS ENTITLED TO FREE EXERCISE CONSIDERATIONS TO AID HIS JUDGMENT EXHORTATIONS TO STRENGTHEN HIS WILL MAY BE OFFERED TO HIM
409-124990-0013 THIS IS NEITHER POSSIBLE NOR DESIRABLE IF HE IS EMINENT IN ANY OF THE QUALITIES WHICH CONDUCE TO HIS OWN GOOD HE IS SO FAR A PROPER OBJECT OF ADMIRATION HE IS SO MUCH THE NEARER TO THE IDEAL PERFECTION OF HUMAN NATURE
409-124990-0014 THOUGH THE PHRASE IS NOT UNOBJECTIONABLE LOWNESS OR DEPRAVATION OF TASTE
409-124990-0015 AND SINCE THIS JUDGMENT AND FEELING ARE A FACT WHICH HE WOULD PREFER TO AVOID IT IS DOING HIM A SERVICE TO WARN HIM OF IT BEFOREHAND AS OF ANY OTHER DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HE EXPOSES HIMSELF
409-124990-0016 WE HAVE A RIGHT ALSO IN VARIOUS WAYS TO ACT UPON OUR UNFAVOURABLE OPINION OF ANY ONE NOT TO THE OPPRESSION OF HIS INDIVIDUALITY BUT IN THE EXERCISE OF OURS
409-124990-0017 WE ARE NOT BOUND FOR EXAMPLE TO SEEK HIS SOCIETY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO AVOID IT THOUGH NOT TO PARADE THE AVOIDANCE FOR WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE SOCIETY MOST ACCEPTABLE TO US
409-124990-0018 WE HAVE A RIGHT AND IT MAY BE OUR DUTY TO CAUTION OTHERS AGAINST HIM IF WE THINK HIS EXAMPLE OR CONVERSATION LIKELY TO HAVE A PERNICIOUS EFFECT ON THOSE WITH WHOM HE ASSOCIATES
409-124990-0019 NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PURPOSELY INFLICTED ON HIM FOR THE SAKE OF PUNISHMENT A PERSON WHO SHOWS RASHNESS OBSTINACY SELF CONCEIT WHO CANNOT LIVE WITHIN MODERATE MEANS WHO CANNOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM HURTFUL INDULGENCES
409-124990-0020 THAT THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH ARE STRICTLY INSEPARABLE FROM THE UNFAVOURABLE JUDGMENT OF OTHERS ARE THE ONLY ONES TO WHICH A PERSON SHOULD EVER BE SUBJECTED FOR THAT PORTION OF HIS CONDUCT AND CHARACTER WHICH CONCERNS HIS OWN GOOD
409-124990-0021 BUT WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH HIM ACTS INJURIOUS TO OTHERS REQUIRE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TREATMENT ENCROACHMENT ON THEIR RIGHTS
409-124990-0022 INFLICTION ON THEM OF ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE NOT JUSTIFIED BY HIS OWN RIGHTS FALSEHOOD OR DUPLICITY IN DEALING WITH THEM UNFAIR OR UNGENEROUS USE OF ADVANTAGES OVER THEM
409-124990-0023 DISSIMULATION AND INSINCERITY IRASCIBILITY ON INSUFFICIENT CAUSE AND RESENTMENT DISPROPORTIONED TO THE PROVOCATION THE LOVE OF DOMINEERING OVER OTHERS THE DESIRE TO ENGROSS MORE THAN ONE'S SHARE OF ADVANTAGES
409-124990-0024 THESE ARE MORAL VICES AND CONSTITUTE A BAD AND ODIOUS MORAL CHARACTER UNLIKE THE SELF REGARDING FAULTS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WHICH ARE NOT PROPERLY IMMORALITIES AND TO WHATEVER PITCH THEY MAY BE CARRIED DO NOT CONSTITUTE WICKEDNESS
409-124990-0025 AND THE REPROBATION WHICH IS DUE TO HIM FOR AN OFFENCE AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS IS NOT A MERELY NOMINAL DISTINCTION IT MAKES A VAST DIFFERENCE BOTH IN OUR FEELINGS AND IN OUR CONDUCT TOWARDS HIM
409-124990-0026 WHETHER HE DISPLEASES US IN THINGS IN WHICH WE THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL HIM OR IN THINGS IN WHICH WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOT IF HE DISPLEASES US WE MAY EXPRESS OUR DISTASTE AND WE MAY STAND ALOOF FROM A PERSON AS WELL AS FROM A THING THAT DISPLEASES US
409-124990-0027 HE MAY BE TO US AN OBJECT OF PITY PERHAPS OF DISLIKE BUT NOT OF ANGER OR RESENTMENT WE SHALL NOT TREAT HIM LIKE AN ENEMY OF SOCIETY THE WORST WE SHALL THINK OURSELVES JUSTIFIED IN DOING IS LEAVING HIM TO HIMSELF
409-124990-0028 IF WE DO NOT INTERFERE BENEVOLENTLY BY SHOWING INTEREST OR CONCERN FOR HIM IT IS FAR OTHERWISE IF HE HAS INFRINGED THE RULES NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY
409-124990-0029 THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTS DO NOT THEN FALL ON HIMSELF BUT ON OTHERS AND SOCIETY AS THE PROTECTOR OF ALL ITS MEMBERS MUST RETALIATE ON HIM MUST INFLICT PAIN ON HIM FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF PUNISHMENT
409-124990-0030 AND MUST TAKE CARE THAT IT BE SUFFICIENTLY SEVERE IN THE ONE CASE HE IS AN OFFENDER AT OUR BAR
409-124990-0031 HOW IT MAY BE ASKED CAN ANY PART OF THE CONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF SOCIETY BE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO THE OTHER MEMBERS
409-124990-0032 AND USUALLY DIMINISHES BY A GREATER OR LESS AMOUNT THE GENERAL RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IF HE DETERIORATES HIS BODILY OR MENTAL FACULTIES HE NOT ONLY BRINGS EVIL UPON ALL WHO DEPENDED ON HIM FOR ANY PORTION OF THEIR HAPPINESS
409-124990-0033 HARDLY ANY OFFENCE THAT IS COMMITTED WOULD DETRACT MORE FROM THE GENERAL SUM OF GOOD FINALLY IF BY HIS VICES OR FOLLIES A PERSON DOES NO DIRECT HARM TO OTHERS HE IS NEVERTHELESS IT MAY BE SAID INJURIOUS BY HIS EXAMPLE
409-124990-0034 AND EVEN IT WILL BE ADDED IF THE CONSEQUENCES OF MISCONDUCT COULD BE CONFINED TO THE VICIOUS OR THOUGHTLESS INDIVIDUAL OUGHT SOCIETY TO ABANDON TO THEIR OWN GUIDANCE THOSE WHO ARE MANIFESTLY UNFIT FOR IT
409-124990-0035 IF PROTECTION AGAINST THEMSELVES IS CONFESSEDLY DUE TO CHILDREN AND PERSONS UNDER AGE
409-124990-0036 WHO ARE EQUALLY INCAPABLE OF SELF GOVERNMENT IF GAMBLING OR DRUNKENNESS OR INCONTINENCE OR IDLENESS OR UNCLEANLINESS ARE AS INJURIOUS TO HAPPINESS AND AS GREAT A HINDRANCE TO IMPROVEMENT AS MANY OR MOST OF THE ACTS PROHIBITED BY LAW
409-124990-0037 WHY IT MAY BE ASKED SHOULD NOT LAW SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH PRACTICABILITY AND SOCIAL CONVENIENCE ENDEAVOUR TO REPRESS THESE ALSO AND AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE UNAVOIDABLE IMPERFECTIONS OF LAW
409-124990-0038 THERE MUST BE SOME LENGTH OF TIME AND AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE AFTER WHICH A MORAL OR PRUDENTIAL TRUTH MAY BE REGARDED AS ESTABLISHED AND IT IS MERELY DESIRED TO PREVENT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION FROM FALLING OVER THE SAME PRECIPICE
409-124990-0039 WHICH HAS BEEN FATAL TO THEIR PREDECESSORS I FULLY ADMIT THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH A PERSON DOES TO HIMSELF MAY SERIOUSLY AFFECT BOTH THROUGH THEIR SYMPATHIES AND THEIR INTERESTS THOSE NEARLY CONNECTED WITH HIM
409-124990-0040 THE MORAL CULPABILITY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME GEORGE BARNWELL MURDERED HIS UNCLE TO GET MONEY FOR HIS MISTRESS BUT IF HE HAD DONE IT TO SET HIMSELF UP IN BUSINESS HE WOULD EQUALLY HAVE BEEN HANGED
409-124990-0041 OR JUSTIFIED BY ALLOWABLE SELF PREFERENCE IS A SUBJECT OF MORAL DISAPPROBATION FOR THAT FAILURE BUT NOT FOR THE CAUSE OF IT NOR FOR THE ERRORS MERELY PERSONAL TO HIMSELF WHICH MAY HAVE REMOTELY LED TO IT
409-124990-0042 NOR OCCASIONS PERCEPTIBLE HURT TO ANY ASSIGNABLE INDIVIDUAL EXCEPT HIMSELF THE INCONVENIENCE IS ONE WHICH SOCIETY CAN AFFORD TO BEAR FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREATER GOOD OF HUMAN FREEDOM IF GROWN PERSONS ARE TO BE PUNISHED FOR NOT TAKING PROPER CARE OF THEMSELVES
409-124990-0043 WHICH SOCIETY DOES NOT PRETEND IT HAS A RIGHT TO EXACT BUT I CANNOT CONSENT TO ARGUE THE POINT AS IF SOCIETY HAD NO MEANS OF BRINGING ITS WEAKER MEMBERS UP TO ITS ORDINARY STANDARD OF RATIONAL CONDUCT EXCEPT WAITING TILL THEY DO SOMETHING IRRATIONAL
409-124990-0044 IT HAS HAD THE WHOLE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD
409-124990-0045 AND ITS BEST EFFORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN INDIVIDUAL CASES ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL ONES BUT IT IS PERFECTLY WELL ABLE TO MAKE THE RISING GENERATION AS A WHOLE AS GOOD AS AND A LITTLE BETTER THAN ITSELF
409-124990-0046 NOR IS THERE ANYTHING WHICH TENDS MORE TO DISCREDIT AND FRUSTRATE THE BETTER MEANS OF INFLUENCING CONDUCT THAN A RESORT TO THE WORSE IF THERE BE AMONG THOSE WHOM IT IS ATTEMPTED TO COERCE INTO PRUDENCE OR TEMPERANCE ANY OF THE MATERIAL
409-124990-0047 AND IT EASILY COMES TO BE CONSIDERED A MARK OF SPIRIT AND COURAGE TO FLY IN THE FACE OF SUCH USURPED AUTHORITY AND DO WITH OSTENTATION THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT ENJOINS AS IN THE FASHION OF GROSSNESS WHICH SUCCEEDED IN THE TIME OF CHARLES TWO
409-124990-0048 TO THE FANATICAL MORAL INTOLERANCE OF THE PURITANS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT IS SAID OF THE NECESSITY OF PROTECTING SOCIETY FROM THE BAD EXAMPLE SET TO OTHERS BY THE VICIOUS OR THE SELF INDULGENT IT IS TRUE THAT BAD EXAMPLE MAY HAVE A PERNICIOUS EFFECT
409-124990-0049 AND I DO NOT SEE HOW THOSE WHO BELIEVE THIS CAN THINK OTHERWISE THAN THAT THE EXAMPLE ON THE WHOLE MUST BE MORE SALUTARY THAN HURTFUL SINCE IF IT DISPLAYS THE MISCONDUCT
409-124990-0050 THAT IS OF AN OVERRULING MAJORITY THOUGH OFTEN WRONG IS LIKELY TO BE STILL OFTENER RIGHT BECAUSE ON SUCH QUESTIONS THEY ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO JUDGE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SOME MODE OF CONDUCT IF ALLOWED TO BE PRACTISED WOULD AFFECT THEMSELVES
409-124990-0051 BUT THE OPINION OF A SIMILAR MAJORITY IMPOSED AS A LAW ON THE MINORITY ON QUESTIONS OF SELF REGARDING CONDUCT IS QUITE AS LIKELY TO BE WRONG AS RIGHT FOR IN THESE CASES PUBLIC OPINION MEANS AT THE BEST
409-124990-0052 SOME PEOPLE'S OPINION OF WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHILE VERY OFTEN IT DOES NOT EVEN MEAN THAT THE PUBLIC WITH THE MOST PERFECT INDIFFERENCE PASSING OVER THE PLEASURE OR CONVENIENCE OF THOSE WHOSE CONDUCT THEY CENSURE AND CONSIDERING ONLY THEIR OWN PREFERENCE
409-124990-0053 THERE ARE MANY WHO CONSIDER AS AN INJURY TO THEMSELVES ANY CONDUCT WHICH THEY HAVE A DISTASTE FOR AND RESENT IT AS AN OUTRAGE TO THEIR FEELINGS AS A RELIGIOUS BIGOT WHEN CHARGED WITH DISREGARDING THE RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF OTHERS
409-124990-0054 NO MORE THAN BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF A THIEF TO TAKE A PURSE AND THE DESIRE OF THE RIGHT OWNER TO KEEP IT AND A PERSON'S TASTE IS AS MUCH HIS OWN PECULIAR CONCERN AS HIS OPINION OR HIS PURSE
409-124990-0055 IT IS EASY FOR ANY ONE TO IMAGINE AN IDEAL PUBLIC WHICH LEAVES THE FREEDOM AND CHOICE OF INDIVIDUALS IN ALL UNCERTAIN MATTERS UNDISTURBED AND ONLY REQUIRES THEM TO ABSTAIN FROM MODES OF CONDUCT WHICH UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE HAS CONDEMNED
409-124990-0056 BUT WHERE HAS THERE BEEN SEEN A PUBLIC WHICH SET ANY SUCH LIMIT TO ITS CENSORSHIP OR WHEN DOES THE PUBLIC TROUBLE ITSELF ABOUT UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE IN ITS INTERFERENCES WITH PERSONAL CONDUCT IT IS SELDOM THINKING OF ANYTHING
409-124990-0057 BUT THE ENORMITY OF ACTING OR FEELING DIFFERENTLY FROM ITSELF AND THIS STANDARD OF JUDGMENT THINLY DISGUISED IS HELD UP TO MANKIND AS THE DICTATE OF RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY BY NINE TENTHS OF ALL MORALISTS AND SPECULATIVE WRITERS
409-124990-0058 BINDING ON OURSELVES AND ON ALL OTHERS WHAT CAN THE POOR PUBLIC DO BUT APPLY THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND MAKE THEIR OWN PERSONAL FEELINGS OF GOOD AND EVIL IF THEY ARE TOLERABLY
409-124990-0059 OBLIGATORY ON ALL THE WORLD THE EVIL HERE POINTED OUT IS NOT ONE WHICH EXISTS ONLY IN THEORY AND IT MAY PERHAPS BE EXPECTED THAT I SHOULD SPECIFY THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THE PUBLIC OF THIS AGE AND COUNTRY IMPROPERLY INVESTS ITS OWN PREFERENCES
409-124990-0060 I AM NOT WRITING AN ESSAY ON THE ABERRATIONS OF EXISTING MORAL FEELING THAT IS TOO WEIGHTY A SUBJECT TO BE DISCUSSED PARENTHETICALLY
409-124990-0061 IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL OF ALL HUMAN PROPENSITIES AS A FIRST INSTANCE CONSIDER THE ANTIPATHIES WHICH MEN CHERISH ON NO BETTER GROUNDS THAN THAT PERSONS WHOSE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEIRS DO NOT PRACTISE THEIR RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
409-124990-0062 THERE ARE FEW ACTS WHICH CHRISTIANS AND EUROPEANS REGARD WITH MORE UNAFFECTED DISGUST THAN MUSSULMANS REGARD THIS PARTICULAR MODE OF SATISFYING HUNGER IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE AN OFFENCE AGAINST THEIR RELIGION
409-124990-0063 BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BY NO MEANS EXPLAINS EITHER THE DEGREE OR THE KIND OF THEIR REPUGNANCE FOR WINE ALSO IS FORBIDDEN BY THEIR RELIGION AND TO PARTAKE OF IT IS BY ALL MUSSULMANS ACCOUNTED WRONG BUT NOT DISGUSTING
409-124990-0064 THEIR AVERSION TO THE FLESH OF THE UNCLEAN BEAST IS ON THE CONTRARY OF THAT PECULIAR CHARACTER RESEMBLING AN INSTINCTIVE ANTIPATHY WHICH THE IDEA OF UNCLEANNESS
409-124990-0065 WHEN ONCE IT THOROUGHLY SINKS INTO THE FEELINGS SEEMS ALWAYS TO EXCITE EVEN IN THOSE WHOSE PERSONAL HABITS ARE ANYTHING BUT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEANLY AND OF WHICH THE SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS IMPURITY SO INTENSE IN THE HINDOOS IS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE
409-124990-0066 GROSS DISGUSTING WHAT DO PROTESTANTS THINK OF THESE PERFECTLY SINCERE FEELINGS AND OF THE ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THEM AGAINST NON CATHOLICS
409-124990-0067 OR WHO CAN BLAME PEOPLE FOR DESIRING TO SUPPRESS WHAT THEY REGARD AS A SCANDAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MAN NO STRONGER CASE CAN BE SHOWN FOR PROHIBITING ANYTHING WHICH IS REGARDED AS A PERSONAL IMMORALITY
409-124990-0068 WE MUST BEWARE OF ADMITTING A PRINCIPLE OF WHICH WE SHOULD RESENT AS A GROSS INJUSTICE THE APPLICATION TO OURSELVES THE PRECEDING INSTANCES MAY BE OBJECTED TO ALTHOUGH UNREASONABLY
409-124990-0069 AS DRAWN FROM CONTINGENCIES IMPOSSIBLE AMONG US OPINION IN THIS COUNTRY NOT BEING LIKELY TO ENFORCE ABSTINENCE FROM MEATS OR TO INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE FOR WORSHIPPING AND FOR EITHER MARRYING OR NOT MARRYING ACCORDING TO THEIR CREED OR INCLINATION
409-124990-0070 THE NEXT EXAMPLE HOWEVER SHALL BE TAKEN FROM AN INTERFERENCE WITH LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE BY NO MEANS PASSED ALL DANGER OF WHEREVER THE PURITANS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL AS IN NEW ENGLAND AND IN GREAT BRITAIN AT THE TIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH
409-124990-0071 THERE ARE STILL IN THIS COUNTRY LARGE BODIES OF PERSONS BY WHOSE NOTIONS OF MORALITY AND RELIGION THESE RECREATIONS ARE CONDEMNED AND THOSE PERSONS BELONGING CHIEFLY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS
409-124990-0072 WHO ARE THE ASCENDANT POWER IN THE PRESENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITION OF THE KINGDOM IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE THAT PERSONS OF THESE SENTIMENTS MAY AT SOME TIME OR OTHER COMMAND A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT HOW WILL THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY
409-124990-0073 OR OTHER PREPONDERATING POWER IN THE COUNTRY AND ALL PERSONS MUST BE READY TO CONFORM TO THE IDEA OF A CHRISTIAN COMMONWEALTH AS UNDERSTOOD BY THE EARLY SETTLERS IN NEW ENGLAND IF A RELIGIOUS PROFESSION SIMILAR TO THEIRS
409-124990-0074 SHOULD EVER SUCCEED IN REGAINING ITS LOST GROUND AS RELIGIONS SUPPOSED TO BE DECLINING HAVE SO OFTEN BEEN KNOWN TO DO TO IMAGINE ANOTHER CONTINGENCY PERHAPS MORE LIKELY TO BE REALISED THAN THE ONE LAST MENTIONED
409-124990-0075 EFFECTUAL SUMPTUARY LAW AND THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNION IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR A PERSON POSSESSING A VERY LARGE INCOME TO FIND ANY MODE OF SPENDING IT WHICH WILL NOT INCUR POPULAR DISAPPROBATION
409-124990-0076 COMBINED WITH THE NOTION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO A VETO ON THE MANNER IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS SHALL SPEND THEIR INCOMES WE HAVE ONLY FURTHER TO SUPPOSE A CONSIDERABLE DIFFUSION OF SOCIALIST OPINIONS
409-124990-0077 AND THAT NO ONE OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED THROUGH PIECEWORK OR OTHERWISE TO EARN BY SUPERIOR SKILL OR INDUSTRY MORE THAN OTHERS CAN WITHOUT IT AND THEY EMPLOY A MORAL POLICE WHICH OCCASIONALLY BECOMES A PHYSICAL ONE TO DETER SKILFUL WORKMEN FROM RECEIVING
409-124990-0078 BUT WITHOUT DWELLING UPON SUPPOSITITIOUS CASES THERE ARE IN OUR OWN DAY GROSS USURPATIONS UPON THE LIBERTY OF PRIVATE LIFE ACTUALLY PRACTISED AND STILL GREATER ONES THREATENED WITH SOME EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS
409-124990-0079 AND OPINIONS PROPOSED WHICH ASSERT AN UNLIMITED RIGHT IN THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY TO PROHIBIT BY LAW EVERYTHING WHICH IT THINKS WRONG BUT IN ORDER TO GET AT WHAT IT THINKS WRONG TO PROHIBIT ANY NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH IT ADMITS TO BE INNOCENT
409-124990-0080 THE PEOPLE OF ONE ENGLISH COLONY AND OF NEARLY HALF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN INTERDICTED BY LAW FROM MAKING ANY USE WHATEVER OF FERMENTED DRINKS
409-124990-0081 FOR PROHIBITION OF THEIR SALE IS IN FACT AS IT IS INTENDED TO BE PROHIBITION OF THEIR USE AND THOUGH THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF EXECUTING THE LAW HAS CAUSED ITS REPEAL IN SEVERAL OF THE STATES WHICH HAD ADOPTED IT
409-124990-0082 TO AGITATE FOR A SIMILAR LAW IN THIS COUNTRY THE ASSOCIATION OR ALLIANCE AS IT TERMS ITSELF WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS ACQUIRED SOME NOTORIETY
409-124990-0083 IN SOME OF HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES UNHAPPILY ARE AMONG THOSE WHO FIGURE IN POLITICAL LIFE THE ORGAN OF THE ALLIANCE WHO WOULD DEEPLY DEPLORE THE RECOGNITION OF ANY PRINCIPLE WHICH COULD BE WRESTED TO JUSTIFY BIGOTRY AND PERSECUTION
409-124990-0084 UNDERTAKES TO POINT OUT THE BROAD AND IMPASSABLE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDES SUCH PRINCIPLES FROM THOSE OF THE ASSOCIATION ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THOUGHT OPINION CONSCIENCE APPEAR TO ME HE SAYS TO BE WITHOUT THE SPHERE OF LEGISLATION
409-124990-0085 VESTED IN THE STATE ITSELF AND NOT IN THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE WITHIN IT NO MENTION IS MADE OF A THIRD CLASS DIFFERENT FROM EITHER OF THESE
409-124990-0086 WHICH ARE NOT SOCIAL BUT INDIVIDUAL ALTHOUGH IT IS TO THIS CLASS SURELY THAT THE ACT OF DRINKING FERMENTED LIQUORS BELONGS SELLING FERMENTED LIQUORS HOWEVER IS TRADING AND TRADING IS A SOCIAL ACT BUT THE INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINED OF
409-124990-0087 BUT ON THAT OF THE BUYER AND CONSUMER SINCE THE STATE MIGHT JUST AS WELL FORBID HIM TO DRINK WINE AS PURPOSELY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBTAIN IT THE SECRETARY HOWEVER SAYS
409-124990-0088 I CLAIM AS A CITIZEN A RIGHT TO LEGISLATE WHENEVER MY SOCIAL RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY THE SOCIAL ACT OF ANOTHER
409-124990-0089 IF ANYTHING INVADES MY SOCIAL RIGHTS CERTAINLY THE TRAFFIC IN STRONG DRINK DOES IT DESTROYS MY PRIMARY RIGHT OF SECURITY BY CONSTANTLY CREATING AND STIMULATING SOCIAL DISORDER IT INVADES MY RIGHT OF EQUALITY
409-124990-0090 BY DERIVING A PROFIT FROM THE CREATION OF A MISERY I AM TAXED TO SUPPORT IT IMPEDES MY RIGHT TO FREE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT BY SURROUNDING MY PATH WITH DANGERS AND BY WEAKENING AND DEMORALISING SOCIETY
409-124990-0091 A THEORY OF SOCIAL RIGHTS THE LIKE OF WHICH PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE FOUND ITS WAY INTO DISTINCT LANGUAGE BEING NOTHING SHORT OF THIS THAT IT IS THE ABSOLUTE SOCIAL RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL
409-124990-0092 THAT EVERY OTHER INDIVIDUAL SHALL ACT IN EVERY RESPECT EXACTLY AS HE OUGHT THAT WHOSOEVER FAILS THEREOF IN THE SMALLEST PARTICULAR VIOLATES MY SOCIAL RIGHT AND ENTITLES ME TO DEMAND FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE REMOVAL OF THE GRIEVANCE
409-124990-0093 EXCEPT PERHAPS TO THAT OF HOLDING OPINIONS IN SECRET WITHOUT EVER DISCLOSING THEM FOR
409-124990-0094 NOT SIMPLY THREATENED BUT LONG SINCE CARRIED INTO TRIUMPHANT EFFECT
409-124990-0095 WITHOUT DOUBT ABSTINENCE ON ONE DAY IN THE WEEK SO FAR AS THE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE PERMIT FROM THE USUAL DAILY OCCUPATION THOUGH IN NO RESPECT RELIGIOUSLY BINDING ON ANY EXCEPT JEWS IS A HIGHLY BENEFICIAL CUSTOM
409-124990-0096 BY SUSPENDING THE GREATER OPERATIONS OF INDUSTRY ON A PARTICULAR DAY BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION GROUNDED ON THE DIRECT INTEREST WHICH OTHERS HAVE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL'S OBSERVANCE OF THE PRACTICE
409-124990-0097 THE OPERATIVES ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT IN THINKING THAT IF ALL WORKED ON SUNDAY SEVEN DAYS WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR SIX DAYS WAGES BUT SO LONG AS THE GREAT MASS OF EMPLOYMENTS ARE SUSPENDED
409-124990-0098 THE SMALL NUMBER WHO FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS MUST STILL WORK OBTAIN A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE OF EARNINGS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGED TO FOLLOW THOSE OCCUPATIONS IF THEY PREFER LEISURE TO EMOLUMENT IF A FURTHER REMEDY IS SOUGHT
409-124990-0099 IT MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CUSTOM OF A HOLIDAY ON SOME OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CLASSES OF PERSONS THE ONLY GROUND THEREFORE ON WHICH RESTRICTIONS ON SUNDAY AMUSEMENTS CAN BE DEFENDED MUST BE THAT THEY ARE RELIGIOUSLY WRONG
409-124990-0100 DIIS CURAE IT REMAINS TO BE PROVED THAT SOCIETY OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS HOLDS A COMMISSION FROM ON HIGH TO AVENGE ANY SUPPOSED OFFENCE TO OMNIPOTENCE WHICH IS NOT ALSO A WRONG TO OUR FELLOW CREATURES
409-124990-0101 THE NOTION THAT IT IS ONE MAN'S DUTY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS
409-124990-0102 AND IF ADMITTED WOULD FULLY JUSTIFY THEM
409-124990-0103 AND HAS BEEN MADE THE FOUNDATION OF A SOCIETY IN THE AGE OF NEWSPAPERS RAILWAYS AND THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH WHAT HERE CONCERNS US IS
409-124990-0104 THAT THIS RELIGION LIKE OTHER AND BETTER RELIGIONS HAS ITS MARTYRS THAT ITS PROPHET AND FOUNDER WAS FOR HIS TEACHING PUT TO DEATH BY A MOB THAT OTHERS OF ITS ADHERENTS LOST THEIR LIVES BY THE SAME LAWLESS VIOLENCE
409-124990-0105 THAT THEY WERE FORCIBLY EXPELLED IN A BODY FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FIRST GREW UP WHILE NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CHASED INTO A SOLITARY RECESS IN THE MIDST OF A DESERT MANY IN THIS COUNTRY OPENLY DECLARE THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT CONVENIENT
409-124990-0106 TO SEND AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THEM AND COMPEL THEM BY FORCE TO CONFORM TO THE OPINIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE THE ARTICLE OF THE MORMONITE DOCTRINE WHICH IS THE CHIEF PROVOCATIVE TO THE ANTIPATHY WHICH THUS BREAKS THROUGH THE ORDINARY RESTRAINTS OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IS ITS SANCTION OF POLYGAMY
409-124990-0107 AND PROFESS TO BE A KIND OF CHRISTIANS NO ONE HAS A DEEPER DISAPPROBATION THAN I HAVE OF THIS MORMON INSTITUTION
409-124990-0108 IT IS A DIRECT INFRACTION OF THAT PRINCIPLE BEING A MERE RIVETING OF THE CHAINS OF ONE HALF OF THE COMMUNITY AND AN EMANCIPATION OF THE OTHER FROM RECIPROCITY OF OBLIGATION TOWARDS THEM
409-124990-0109 AND HOWEVER SURPRISING THIS FACT MAY APPEAR IT HAS ITS EXPLANATION IN THE COMMON IDEAS AND CUSTOMS OF THE WORLD WHICH TEACHING WOMEN TO THINK MARRIAGE THE ONE THING NEEDFUL MAKE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT MANY A WOMAN SHOULD PREFER BEING ONE OF SEVERAL WIVES
409-124990-0110 BUT WHEN THE DISSENTIENTS HAVE CONCEDED TO THE HOSTILE SENTIMENTS OF OTHERS FAR MORE THAN COULD JUSTLY BE DEMANDED WHEN THEY HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRIES TO WHICH THEIR DOCTRINES WERE UNACCEPTABLE AND ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN A REMOTE CORNER OF THE EARTH
409-124990-0111 A RECENT WRITER IN SOME RESPECTS OF CONSIDERABLE MERIT PROPOSES TO USE HIS OWN WORDS NOT A CRUSADE BUT A CIVILIZADE AGAINST THIS POLYGAMOUS COMMUNITY
409-124990-0112 TO PUT AN END TO WHAT SEEMS TO HIM A RETROGRADE STEP IN CIVILISATION IT ALSO APPEARS SO TO ME BUT I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY COMMUNITY HAS A RIGHT TO FORCE ANOTHER TO BE CIVILISED
409-124990-0113 WHO HAVE NO PART OR CONCERN IN IT LET THEM SEND MISSIONARIES IF THEY PLEASE TO PREACH AGAINST IT AND LET THEM BY ANY FAIR MEANS OF WHICH SILENCING THE TEACHERS IS NOT ONE OPPOSE THE PROGRESS OF SIMILAR DOCTRINES AMONG THEIR OWN PEOPLE
409-124990-0114 A CIVILISATION THAT CAN THUS SUCCUMB TO ITS VANQUISHED ENEMY MUST FIRST HAVE BECOME SO DEGENERATE THAT NEITHER ITS APPOINTED PRIESTS AND TEACHERS NOR ANYBODY ELSE HAS THE CAPACITY OR WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO STAND UP FOR IT
409-124990-0115 IF THIS BE SO THE SOONER SUCH A CIVILISATION RECEIVES NOTICE TO QUIT THE BETTER IT CAN ONLY GO ON FROM BAD TO WORSE UNTIL DESTROYED AND REGENERATED LIKE THE WESTERN EMPIRE BY ENERGETIC BARBARIANS
409-124990-0116 FLYING FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY BEFORE THE CALIPHS ARRIVED IN WESTERN INDIA THEY WERE ADMITTED TO TOLERATION BY THE HINDOO SOVEREIGNS ON CONDITION OF NOT EATING BEEF
409-124990-0117 THOUGH NOT REQUIRED BY THEIR RELIGION
