969-134373-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN NEWMAN NOGGS INDUCTS MISSUS AND MISS NICKLEBY INTO THEIR NEW DWELLING IN THE CITY MISS NICKLEBY'S REFLECTIONS AS SHE WENDED HER WAY HOMEWARDS
969-134373-0001 WERE OF THAT DESPONDING NATURE WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CALCULATED TO AWAKEN HER UNCLE'S WAS NOT A MANNER LIKELY TO DISPEL ANY DOUBTS OR APPREHENSIONS SHE MIGHT HAVE FORMED IN THE OUTSET
969-134373-0002 NEITHER WAS THE GLIMPSE SHE HAD HAD OF MADAME MANTALINI'S ESTABLISHMENT BY ANY MEANS ENCOURAGING IT WAS WITH MANY GLOOMY FOREBODINGS AND MISGIVINGS THEREFORE THAT SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH A HEAVY HEART TO THE OPENING OF HER NEW CAREER
969-134373-0003 OF MILLINERS WHO HAD BEEN POSSESSED OF CONSIDERABLE PROPERTY THOUGH WHETHER THEY HAD ACQUIRED IT ALL IN BUSINESS OR HAD HAD A CAPITAL TO START WITH OR HAD BEEN LUCKY AND MARRIED TO ADVANTAGE SHE COULD NOT EXACTLY REMEMBER HOWEVER
969-134373-0004 AS SHE VERY LOGICALLY REMARKED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME YOUNG PERSON IN THAT WAY OF BUSINESS WHO HAD MADE A FORTUNE WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO BEGIN WITH AND THAT BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED WHY SHOULD NOT KATE DO THE SAME MISS LA CREEVY
969-134373-0005 SAID MISS LA CREEVY I RECOLLECT GETTING THREE YOUNG MILLINERS TO SIT TO ME WHEN I FIRST BEGAN TO PAINT AND I REMEMBER THAT THEY WERE ALL VERY PALE AND SICKLY
969-134373-0006 OH THAT'S NOT A GENERAL RULE BY ANY MEANS OBSERVED MISSUS NICKLEBY FOR I REMEMBER AS WELL AS IF IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY EMPLOYING ONE THAT I WAS PARTICULARLY RECOMMENDED TO TO MAKE ME A SCARLET CLOAK AT THE TIME WHEN SCARLET CLOAKS WERE FASHIONABLE
969-134373-0007 AND SHE HAD A VERY RED FACE A VERY RED FACE INDEED PERHAPS SHE DRANK SUGGESTED MISS LA CREEVY I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MAY HAVE BEEN RETURNED MISSUS NICKLEBY BUT I KNOW SHE HAD A VERY RED FACE
969-134373-0008 SO YOUR ARGUMENT GOES FOR NOTHING IN THIS MANNER AND WITH LIKE POWERFUL REASONING DID THE WORTHY MATRON MEET EVERY LITTLE OBJECTION THAT PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE NEW SCHEME OF THE MORNING HAPPY MISSUS NICKLEBY
969-134373-0009 A PROJECT HAD BUT TO BE NEW AND IT CAME HOME TO HER MIND BRIGHTLY VARNISHED AND GILDED AS A GLITTERING TOY THIS QUESTION DISPOSED OF KATE COMMUNICATED HER UNCLE'S DESIRE ABOUT THE EMPTY HOUSE
969-134373-0010 CHARACTERISTICALLY REMARKING THAT ON THE FINE EVENINGS IT WOULD BE A PLEASANT AMUSEMENT FOR HER TO WALK TO THE WEST END TO FETCH HER DAUGHTER HOME AND NO LESS CHARACTERISTICALLY FORGETTING THAT THERE WERE SUCH THINGS AS WET NIGHTS AND BAD WEATHER TO BE ENCOUNTERED
969-134373-0011 IN ALMOST EVERY WEEK OF THE YEAR I SHALL BE SORRY TRULY SORRY TO LEAVE YOU MY KIND FRIEND SAID KATE ON WHOM THE GOOD FEELING OF THE POOR MINIATURE PAINTER HAD MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION
969-134373-0012 YOU SHALL NOT SHAKE ME OFF FOR ALL THAT REPLIED MISS LA CREEVY WITH AS MUCH SPRIGHTLINESS AS SHE COULD ASSUME I SHALL SEE YOU VERY OFTEN AND COME AND HEAR HOW YOU GET ON
969-134373-0013 OR ALL THE WIDE WORLD BESIDES THERE IS NO OTHER HEART THAT TAKES AN INTEREST IN YOUR WELFARE
969-134373-0014 SAT DOWN IN A CORNER AND HAD WHAT SHE TERMED A REAL GOOD CRY BUT NO CRYING OR TALKING OR HOPING OR FEARING COULD KEEP OFF THE DREADED SATURDAY AFTERNOON OR NEWMAN NOGGS EITHER WHO PUNCTUAL TO HIS TIME
969-134373-0015 LIMPED UP TO THE DOOR AND BREATHED A WHIFF OF CORDIAL GIN THROUGH THE KEYHOLE EXACTLY AS SUCH OF THE CHURCH CLOCKS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AS AGREED AMONG THEMSELVES ABOUT THE TIME STRUCK FIVE NEWMAN WAITED FOR THE LAST STROKE AND THEN KNOCKED
969-134373-0016 FROM MISTER RALPH NICKLEBY SAID NEWMAN ANNOUNCING HIS ERRAND WHEN HE GOT UPSTAIRS WITH ALL POSSIBLE BREVITY WE SHALL BE READY DIRECTLY SAID KATE WE HAVE NOT MUCH TO CARRY BUT I FEAR WE MUST HAVE A COACH I'LL GET ONE REPLIED NEWMAN
969-134373-0017 INDEED YOU SHALL NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY I WILL SAID NEWMAN I CAN'T SUFFER YOU TO THINK OF SUCH A THING SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY YOU CAN'T HELP IT SAID NEWMAN NOT HELP IT NO I THOUGHT OF IT AS I CAME ALONG
969-134373-0018 BUT DIDN'T GET ONE THINKING YOU MIGHTN'T BE READY I THINK OF A GREAT MANY THINGS NOBODY CAN PREVENT THAT OH YES I UNDERSTAND YOU MISTER NOGGS SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY OUR THOUGHTS ARE FREE OF COURSE
969-134373-0019 NEWMAN DARTED A MEANING GLANCE AT KATE AND REPLIED WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE LAST WORD OF HIS ANSWER THAT MISTER RALPH NICKLEBY WAS WELL AND SENT HIS LOVE I AM SURE WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM OBSERVED MISSUS NICKLEBY
969-134373-0020 VERY SAID NEWMAN I'LL TELL HIM SO IT WAS NO VERY EASY MATTER TO MISTAKE NEWMAN NOGGS AFTER HAVING ONCE SEEN HIM AND AS KATE ATTRACTED BY THE SINGULARITY OF HIS MANNER IN WHICH ON THIS OCCASION HOWEVER THERE WAS SOMETHING RESPECTFUL AND EVEN DELICATE
969-134373-0021 NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABRUPTNESS OF HIS SPEECH LOOKED AT HIM MORE CLOSELY SHE RECOLLECTED HAVING CAUGHT A PASSING GLIMPSE OF THAT STRANGE FIGURE BEFORE EXCUSE MY CURIOSITY SHE SAID BUT DID I NOT SEE YOU IN THE COACHYARD ON THE MORNING MY BROTHER WENT AWAY TO YORKSHIRE
969-134373-0022 I'VE HAD THE GOUT NEWMAN WAS VERY VERY FAR FROM HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF A GOUTY SUBJECT AND SO KATE COULD NOT HELP THINKING BUT THE CONFERENCE WAS CUT SHORT BY MISSUS NICKLEBY'S INSISTING ON HAVING THE DOOR SHUT LEST MISTER NOGGS SHOULD TAKE COLD
969-134373-0023 AND FURTHER PERSISTING IN SENDING THE SERVANT GIRL FOR A COACH FOR FEAR HE SHOULD BRING ON ANOTHER ATTACK OF HIS DISORDER TO BOTH CONDITIONS NEWMAN WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD PRESENTLY THE COACH CAME
969-134373-0024 AND AFTER MANY SORROWFUL FAREWELLS AND A GREAT DEAL OF RUNNING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ACROSS THE PAVEMENT ON THE PART OF MISS LA CREEVY IN THE COURSE OF WHICH THE YELLOW TURBAN CAME INTO VIOLENT CONTACT WITH SUNDRY FOOT PASSENGERS IT
969-134373-0025 THAT IS TO SAY THE COACH NOT THE TURBAN WENT AWAY AGAIN WITH THE TWO LADIES AND THEIR LUGGAGE INSIDE AND NEWMAN DESPITE ALL MISSUS NICKLEBY'S ASSURANCES THAT IT WOULD BE HIS DEATH ON THE BOX BESIDE THE DRIVER THEY WENT INTO THE CITY
969-134373-0026 TURNING DOWN BY THE RIVER SIDE AND AFTER A LONG AND VERY SLOW DRIVE THE STREETS BEING CROWDED AT THAT HOUR WITH VEHICLES OF EVERY KIND STOPPED IN FRONT OF A LARGE OLD DINGY HOUSE IN THAMES STREET
969-134373-0027 THE DOOR AND WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE SO BESPATTERED WITH MUD THAT IT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN UNINHABITED FOR YEARS THE DOOR OF THIS DESERTED MANSION NEWMAN OPENED WITH A KEY WHICH HE TOOK OUT OF HIS HAT
969-134373-0028 IN WHICH BY THE BYE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DILAPIDATED STATE OF HIS POCKETS HE DEPOSITED EVERYTHING AND WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE CARRIED HIS MONEY IF HE HAD HAD ANY AND THE COACH BEING DISCHARGED HE LED THE WAY INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE MANSION
969-134373-0029 SOME BONES OF ANIMALS FRAGMENTS OF IRON HOOPS AND STAVES OF OLD CASKS LAY STREWN ABOUT BUT NO LIFE WAS STIRRING THERE IT WAS A PICTURE OF COLD SILENT DECAY THIS HOUSE DEPRESSES AND CHILLS ONE SAID KATE
969-134373-0030 AND SEEMS AS IF SOME BLIGHT HAD FALLEN ON IT IF I WERE SUPERSTITIOUS I SHOULD BE ALMOST INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT SOME DREADFUL CRIME HAD BEEN PERPETRATED WITHIN THESE OLD WALLS AND THAT THE PLACE HAD NEVER PROSPERED SINCE HOW FROWNING AND HOW DARK IT LOOKS
969-134373-0031 LORD MY DEAR REPLIED MISSUS NICKLEBY DON'T TALK IN THAT WAY OR YOU'LL FRIGHTEN ME TO DEATH IT IS ONLY MY FOOLISH FANCY MAMA SAID KATE FORCING A SMILE WELL THEN MY LOVE I WISH YOU WOULD KEEP YOUR FOOLISH FANCY TO YOURSELF
969-134373-0032 AND NOT WAKE UP MY FOOLISH FANCY TO KEEP IT COMPANY RETORTED MISSUS NICKLEBY WHY DIDN'T YOU THINK OF ALL THIS BEFORE YOU ARE SO CARELESS WE MIGHT HAVE ASKED MISS LA CREEVY TO KEEP US COMPANY OR BORROWED A DOG OR A THOUSAND THINGS
969-134373-0033 BUT IT ALWAYS WAS THE WAY AND WAS JUST THE SAME WITH YOUR POOR DEAR FATHER UNLESS I THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING THIS WAS MISSUS NICKLEBY'S USUAL COMMENCEMENT OF A GENERAL LAMENTATION RUNNING THROUGH A DOZEN OR SO OF COMPLICATED SENTENCES ADDRESSED TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR
969-134373-0034 AND INTO WHICH SHE NOW LAUNCHED UNTIL HER BREATH WAS EXHAUSTED NEWMAN APPEARED NOT TO HEAR THESE REMARKS BUT PRECEDED THEM TO A COUPLE OF ROOMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR WHICH SOME KIND OF ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO RENDER HABITABLE
969-134373-0035 IN ONE WERE A FEW CHAIRS A TABLE AN OLD HEARTH RUG AND SOME FADED BAIZE AND A FIRE WAS READY LAID IN THE GRATE IN THE OTHER STOOD AN OLD TENT BEDSTEAD AND A FEW SCANTY ARTICLES OF CHAMBER FURNITURE
969-134373-0036 VERY KIND INDEED REPLIED KATE LOOKING ROUND NEWMAN NOGGS DID NOT SAY THAT HE HAD HUNTED UP THE OLD FURNITURE THEY SAW FROM ATTIC AND CELLAR OR THAT HE HAD TAKEN IN THE HALFPENNYWORTH OF MILK FOR TEA THAT STOOD UPON A SHELF
969-134373-0037 OR FILLED THE RUSTY KETTLE ON THE HOB OR COLLECTED THE WOODCHIPS FROM THE WHARF OR BEGGED THE COALS BUT THE NOTION OF RALPH NICKLEBY HAVING DIRECTED IT TO BE DONE TICKLED HIS FANCY SO MUCH
969-134373-0038 THAT HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM CRACKING ALL HIS TEN FINGERS IN SUCCESSION AT WHICH PERFORMANCE MISSUS NICKLEBY WAS RATHER STARTLED AT FIRST BUT SUPPOSING IT TO BE IN SOME REMOTE MANNER CONNECTED WITH THE GOUT DID NOT REMARK UPON
969-134373-0039 WE NEED DETAIN YOU NO LONGER I THINK SAID KATE IS THERE NOTHING I CAN DO ASKED NEWMAN NOTHING THANK YOU REJOINED MISS NICKLEBY PERHAPS MY DEAR
969-134373-0040 MISTER NOGGS WOULD LIKE TO DRINK OUR HEALTHS SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY FUMBLING IN HER RETICULE FOR SOME SMALL COIN I THINK MAMA SAID KATE HESITATING AND REMARKING NEWMAN'S AVERTED FACE YOU WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS IF YOU OFFERED IT
969-134373-0041 NEWMAN NOGGS BOWING TO THE YOUNG LADY MORE LIKE A GENTLEMAN THAN THE MISERABLE WRETCH HE SEEMED PLACED HIS HAND UPON HIS BREAST AND PAUSING FOR A MOMENT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO STRUGGLES TO SPEAK BUT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT TO SAY QUITTED THE ROOM
969-134373-0042 AS THE JARRING ECHOES OF THE HEAVY HOUSE DOOR CLOSING ON ITS LATCH REVERBERATED DISMALLY THROUGH THE BUILDING KATE FELT HALF TEMPTED TO CALL HIM BACK AND BEG HIM TO REMAIN A LITTLE WHILE BUT SHE WAS ASHAMED TO OWN HER FEARS
