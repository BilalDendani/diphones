1509-143477-0000 HE HAD NEVER YET HEARD A YOUNG GIRL EXPRESS HERSELF IN JUST THIS FASHION NEVER AT LEAST SAVE IN CASES WHERE TO SAY SUCH THINGS SEEMED A KIND OF DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE OF A CERTAIN LAXITY OF DEPORTMENT
1509-143477-0001 AS THEY SAID AT GENEVA HE FELT THAT HE HAD LIVED AT GENEVA SO LONG THAT HE HAD LOST A GOOD DEAL HE HAD BECOME DISHABITUATED TO THE AMERICAN TONE NEVER INDEED SINCE HE HAD GROWN OLD ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THINGS
1509-143477-0002 HAD HE ENCOUNTERED A YOUNG AMERICAN GIRL OF SO PRONOUNCED A TYPE AS THIS CERTAINLY SHE WAS VERY CHARMING BUT HOW DEUCEDLY SOCIABLE WAS SHE SIMPLY A PRETTY GIRL FROM NEW YORK STATE WERE THEY ALL LIKE THAT THE PRETTY GIRLS WHO HAD A
1509-143477-0003 GOOD DEAL OF GENTLEMEN'S SOCIETY OR WAS SHE ALSO A DESIGNING AN AUDACIOUS AN UNSCRUPULOUS YOUNG PERSON WINTERBOURNE HAD LOST HIS INSTINCT IN THIS MATTER AND HIS REASON COULD NOT HELP HIM MISS DAISY MILLER LOOKED EXTREMELY INNOCENT
1509-143477-0004 SOME PEOPLE HAD TOLD HIM THAT AFTER ALL AMERICAN GIRLS WERE EXCEEDINGLY INNOCENT AND OTHERS HAD TOLD HIM THAT AFTER ALL THEY WERE NOT HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK MISS DAISY MILLER WAS A FLIRT A PRETTY AMERICAN FLIRT
1509-143477-0005 DANGEROUS TERRIBLE WOMEN WITH WHOM ONE'S RELATIONS WERE LIABLE TO TAKE A SERIOUS TURN BUT THIS YOUNG GIRL WAS NOT A COQUETTE IN THAT SENSE SHE WAS VERY UNSOPHISTICATED SHE WAS ONLY A PRETTY AMERICAN FLIRT
1509-143477-0006 WINTERBOURNE WAS ALMOST GRATEFUL FOR HAVING FOUND THE FORMULA THAT APPLIED TO MISS DAISY MILLER HE LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT HE REMARKED TO HIMSELF THAT SHE HAD THE MOST CHARMING NOSE HE HAD EVER SEEN HE WONDERED WHAT WERE THE REGULAR CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS
1509-143477-0007 YES FORMERLY MORE THAN ONCE SAID WINTERBOURNE YOU TOO I SUPPOSE HAVE SEEN IT NO WE HAVEN'T BEEN THERE I WANT TO GO THERE DREADFULLY OF COURSE I MEAN TO GO THERE I WOULDN'T GO AWAY FROM HERE WITHOUT HAVING SEEN THAT OLD CASTLE
1509-143477-0008 IT'S A VERY PRETTY EXCURSION SAID WINTERBOURNE AND VERY EASY TO MAKE YOU CAN DRIVE YOU KNOW OR YOU CAN GO BY THE LITTLE STEAMER YOU CAN GO IN THE CARS SAID MISS MILLER YES YOU CAN GO IN THE CARS WINTERBOURNE ASSENTED
1509-143477-0009 OUR COURIER SAYS THEY TAKE YOU RIGHT UP TO THE CASTLE THE YOUNG GIRL CONTINUED WE WERE GOING LAST WEEK BUT MY MOTHER GAVE OUT SHE SUFFERS DREADFULLY FROM DYSPEPSIA SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T GO RANDOLPH WOULDN'T GO EITHER

1509-143477-0011 I SHOULD THINK IT MIGHT BE ARRANGED SAID WINTERBOURNE COULDN'T YOU GET SOME ONE TO STAY FOR THE AFTERNOON WITH RANDOLPH MISS MILLER LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT AND THEN VERY PLACIDLY I WISH YOU WOULD STAY WITH HIM SHE SAID WINTERBOURNE HESITATED A MOMENT
1509-143477-0012 WITH ME ASKED THE YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SAME PLACIDITY SHE DIDN'T RISE BLUSHING AS A YOUNG GIRL AT GENEVA WOULD HAVE DONE AND YET WINTERBOURNE CONSCIOUS THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY BOLD THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE SHE WAS OFFENDED WITH YOUR MOTHER HE ANSWERED VERY RESPECTFULLY
1509-143477-0013 THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO UP THERE MOST EARNESTLY WINTERBOURNE DECLARED THEN WE MAY ARRANGE IT IF MOTHER WILL STAY WITH RANDOLPH I GUESS EUGENIO WILL EUGENIO THE YOUNG MAN INQUIRED EUGENIO'S OUR COURIER
1509-143477-0014 WE COULD ONLY MEAN MISS DAISY MILLER AND HIMSELF THIS PROGRAM SEEMED ALMOST TOO AGREEABLE FOR CREDENCE HE FELT AS IF HE OUGHT TO KISS THE YOUNG LADY'S HAND POSSIBLY HE WOULD HAVE DONE SO AND QUITE SPOILED THE PROJECT BUT AT THIS MOMENT ANOTHER PERSON
1509-143477-0015 PRESUMABLY EUGENIO APPEARED A TALL HANDSOME MAN WITH SUPERB WHISKERS WEARING A VELVET MORNING COAT AND A BRILLIANT WATCH CHAIN APPROACHED MISS MILLER LOOKING SHARPLY AT HER COMPANION OH EUGENIO SAID MISS MILLER WITH THE FRIENDLIEST ACCENT
1509-143477-0016 EUGENIO HAD LOOKED AT WINTERBOURNE FROM HEAD TO FOOT HE NOW BOWED GRAVELY TO THE YOUNG LADY I HAVE THE HONOR TO INFORM MADEMOISELLE THAT LUNCHEON IS UPON THE TABLE MISS MILLER SLOWLY ROSE SEE HERE EUGENIO SHE SAID I'M GOING TO THAT OLD CASTLE ANYWAY
1509-143477-0017 THE COURIER INQUIRED MADEMOISELLE HAS MADE ARRANGEMENTS
1509-143477-0018 EUGENIO'S TONE APPARENTLY THREW EVEN TO MISS MILLER'S OWN APPREHENSION A SLIGHTLY IRONICAL LIGHT UPON THE YOUNG GIRL'S SITUATION SHE TURNED TO WINTERBOURNE BLUSHING A LITTLE A VERY LITTLE YOU WON'T BACK OUT SHE SAID
1509-143477-0019 I SHALL NOT BE HAPPY TILL WE GO HE PROTESTED AND YOU ARE STAYING IN THIS HOTEL SHE WENT ON
1509-143477-0020 THE COURIER STOOD LOOKING AT WINTERBOURNE OFFENSIVELY THE YOUNG MAN AT LEAST THOUGHT HIS MANNER OF LOOKING AN OFFENSE TO MISS MILLER IT CONVEYED AN IMPUTATION THAT SHE PICKED UP ACQUAINTANCES
1509-143477-0021 HE SAID SMILING AND REFERRING TO HIS AUNT OH WELL WE'LL GO SOME DAY SAID MISS MILLER AND SHE GAVE HIM A SMILE AND TURNED AWAY SHE PUT UP HER PARASOL AND WALKED BACK TO THE INN BESIDE EUGENIO WINTERBOURNE STOOD LOOKING AFTER HER
1509-143477-0022 AND AS SHE MOVED AWAY DRAWING HER MUSLIN FURBELOWS OVER THE GRAVEL SAID TO HIMSELF THAT SHE HAD THE TOURNURE OF A PRINCESS HE HAD HOWEVER ENGAGED TO DO MORE THAN PROVED FEASIBLE IN PROMISING TO PRESENT HIS AUNT MISSUS COSTELLO TO MISS DAISY MILLER
1509-143477-0023 AS SOON AS THE FORMER LADY HAD GOT BETTER OF HER HEADACHE HE WAITED UPON HER IN HER APARTMENT AND AFTER THE PROPER INQUIRIES IN REGARD TO HER HEALTH
1509-143477-0024 A MAMMA A DAUGHTER AND A LITTLE BOY AND A COURIER SAID MISSUS COSTELLO OH YES I HAVE OBSERVED THEM SEEN THEM
1509-143477-0025 A HIGH NOSE AND A GREAT DEAL OF VERY STRIKING WHITE HAIR WHICH SHE WORE IN LARGE PUFFS AND ROULEAUX OVER THE TOP OF HER HEAD
1509-143477-0026 THIS YOUNG MAN WAS AMUSING HIMSELF AT HAMBURG AND THOUGH HE WAS ON HIS TRAVELS WAS RARELY PERCEIVED TO VISIT ANY PARTICULAR CITY AT THE MOMENT SELECTED BY HIS MOTHER FOR HER OWN APPEARANCE THERE
1509-143477-0027 WAS THEREFORE MORE ATTENTIVE THAN THOSE WHO AS SHE SAID WERE NEARER TO HER HE HAD IMBIBED AT GENEVA THE IDEA THAT ONE MUST ALWAYS BE ATTENTIVE TO ONE'S AUNT MISSUS COSTELLO HAD NOT SEEN HIM FOR MANY YEARS AND SHE WAS GREATLY PLEASED WITH HIM
1509-143477-0028 MANIFESTING HER APPROBATION BY INITIATING HIM INTO MANY OF THE SECRETS OF THAT SOCIAL SWAY WHICH AS SHE GAVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND SHE EXERTED IN THE AMERICAN CAPITAL SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE WAS VERY EXCLUSIVE BUT IF HE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH NEW YORK
1509-143477-0029 HE IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED FROM HER TONE THAT MISS DAISY MILLER'S PLACE IN THE SOCIAL SCALE WAS LOW I AM AFRAID YOU DON'T APPROVE OF THEM HE SAID THEY ARE VERY COMMON MISSUS COSTELLO DECLARED
1509-143477-0030 NOT ACCEPTING AH YOU DON'T ACCEPT THEM SAID THE YOUNG MAN I CAN'T MY DEAR FREDERICK I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I CAN'T THE YOUNG GIRL IS VERY PRETTY SAID WINTERBOURNE IN A MOMENT OF COURSE SHE'S PRETTY
1509-143477-0031 BUT SHE IS VERY COMMON I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN OF COURSE SAID WINTERBOURNE AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE SHE HAS THAT CHARMING LOOK THAT THEY ALL HAVE HIS AUNT RESUMED I CAN'T THINK WHERE THEY PICK IT UP AND SHE DRESSES IN PERFECTION
1509-143477-0032 NO YOU DON'T KNOW HOW WELL SHE DRESSES I CAN'T THINK WHERE THEY GET THEIR TASTE BUT MY DEAR AUNT SHE IS NOT AFTER ALL A COMANCHE SAVAGE SHE IS A YOUNG LADY SAID MISSUS COSTELLO
1509-143477-0033 AN INTIMACY WITH THE COURIER THE YOUNG MAN DEMANDED OH THE MOTHER IS JUST AS BAD THEY TREAT THE COURIER LIKE A FAMILIAR FRIEND LIKE A GENTLEMAN I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF HE DINES WITH THEM
1509-143477-0034 VERY LIKELY THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A MAN WITH SUCH GOOD MANNERS SUCH FINE CLOTHES SO LIKE A GENTLEMAN
1509-143477-0035 COUNT HE SITS WITH THEM IN THE GARDEN IN THE EVENING I THINK HE SMOKES WINTERBOURNE LISTENED WITH INTEREST TO THESE DISCLOSURES THEY HELPED HIM TO MAKE UP HIS MIND ABOUT MISS DAISY EVIDENTLY SHE WAS RATHER WILD
1509-143477-0036 WELL HE SAID I AM NOT A COURIER AND YET SHE WAS VERY CHARMING TO ME YOU HAD BETTER HAVE SAID AT FIRST SAID MISSUS COSTELLO WITH DIGNITY THAT YOU HAD MADE HER ACQUAINTANCE
1509-143477-0037 DID YOU SAY I SAID I SHOULD TAKE THE LIBERTY OF INTRODUCING HER TO MY ADMIRABLE AUNT I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU IT WAS TO GUARANTEE MY RESPECTABILITY SAID WINTERBOURNE AND PRAY
1509-143477-0038 AH YOU ARE CRUEL SAID THE YOUNG MAN
1509-143477-0039 YOU DON'T SAY THAT AS IF YOU BELIEVED IT MISSUS COSTELLO OBSERVED
1509-143477-0040 CRIED MISSUS COSTELLO WHAT A DREADFUL GIRL HER NEPHEW WAS SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTS YOU REALLY THINK THEN HE BEGAN EARNESTLY AND WITH A DESIRE FOR TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION YOU REALLY THINK THAT BUT HE PAUSED AGAIN
1509-143477-0041 THINK WHAT SIR SAID HIS AUNT THAT SHE IS THE SORT OF YOUNG LADY WHO EXPECTS A MAN SOONER OR LATER TO CARRY HER OFF I HAVEN'T THE LEAST IDEA WHAT SUCH YOUNG LADIES EXPECT A MAN TO DO
1509-143477-0042 YOU HAVE LIVED TOO LONG OUT OF THE COUNTRY YOU WILL BE SURE TO MAKE SOME GREAT MISTAKE
1509-143477-0043 MY DEAR AUNT I AM NOT SO INNOCENT SAID WINTERBOURNE SMILING AND CURLING HIS MUSTACHE
1509-143477-0044 WINTERBOURNE CONTINUED TO CURL HIS MUSTACHE MEDITATIVELY YOU WON'T LET THE POOR GIRL KNOW YOU THEN HE ASKED AT LAST
1509-143477-0045 I THINK THAT SHE FULLY INTENDS IT THEN MY DEAR FREDERICK SAID MISSUS COSTELLO I MUST DECLINE THE HONOR OF HER ACQUAINTANCE I AM AN OLD WOMAN BUT I AM NOT TOO OLD THANK HEAVEN TO BE SHOCKED
1509-143477-0046 BUT DON'T THEY ALL DO THESE THINGS THE YOUNG GIRLS IN AMERICA WINTERBOURNE INQUIRED MISSUS COSTELLO STARED A MOMENT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY GRANDDAUGHTERS DO THEM SHE DECLARED GRIMLY THIS SEEMED TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THE MATTER
1509-143477-0047 TREMENDOUS FLIRTS IF THEREFORE MISS DAISY MILLER EXCEEDED THE LIBERAL MARGIN ALLOWED TO THESE YOUNG LADIES IT WAS PROBABLE THAT ANYTHING MIGHT BE EXPECTED OF HER WINTERBOURNE WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE HER AGAIN AND HE WAS VEXED WITH HIMSELF THAT BY INSTINCT
1509-143477-0048 HE SHOULD NOT APPRECIATE HER JUSTLY THOUGH HE WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE HER HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE SHOULD SAY TO HER ABOUT HIS AUNT'S REFUSAL TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH HER BUT HE DISCOVERED PROMPTLY ENOUGH THAT WITH MISS DAISY MILLER THERE WAS NO GREAT NEED OF WALKING ON TIPTOE
1509-143477-0049 HE FOUND HER THAT EVENING IN THE GARDEN WANDERING ABOUT IN THE WARM STARLIGHT LIKE AN INDOLENT SYLPH AND SWINGING TO AND FRO THE LARGEST FAN HE HAD EVER BEHELD IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK HE HAD DINED WITH HIS AUNT
1509-143477-0050 MISS DAISY MILLER SEEMED VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM SHE DECLARED IT WAS THE LONGEST EVENING SHE HAD EVER PASSED HAVE YOU BEEN ALL ALONE HE ASKED I HAVE BEEN WALKING ROUND WITH MOTHER BUT MOTHER GETS TIRED WALKING ROUND SHE ANSWERED HAS SHE GONE TO BED
1509-143477-0051 NO SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO GO TO BED SAID THE YOUNG GIRL SHE DOESN'T SLEEP NOT THREE HOURS SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW SHE LIVES SHE'S DREADFULLY NERVOUS I GUESS SHE SLEEPS MORE THAN SHE THINKS SHE'S GONE SOMEWHERE AFTER RANDOLPH
1509-143477-0052 SHE WANTS TO TRY TO GET HIM TO GO TO BED HE DOESN'T LIKE TO GO TO BED LET US HOPE SHE WILL PERSUADE HIM OBSERVED WINTERBOURNE SHE WILL TALK TO HIM ALL SHE CAN BUT HE DOESN'T LIKE HER TO TALK TO HIM
1509-143477-0053 SAID MISS DAISY OPENING HER FAN SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO GET EUGENIO TO TALK TO HIM BUT HE ISN'T AFRAID OF EUGENIO EUGENIO'S A SPLENDID COURIER BUT HE CAN'T MAKE MUCH IMPRESSION ON RANDOLPH I DON'T BELIEVE HE'LL GO TO BED BEFORE ELEVEN
1509-143477-0054 IT APPEARED THAT RANDOLPH'S VIGIL WAS IN FACT TRIUMPHANTLY PROLONGED FOR WINTERBOURNE STROLLED ABOUT WITH THE YOUNG GIRL FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT MEETING HER MOTHER I HAVE BEEN LOOKING ROUND FOR THAT LADY YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE ME TO HIS COMPANION RESUMED SHE'S YOUR AUNT
1509-143477-0055 THEN ON WINTERBOURNE'S ADMITTING THE FACT AND EXPRESSING SOME CURIOSITY AS TO HOW SHE HAD LEARNED IT SHE SAID SHE HAD HEARD ALL ABOUT MISSUS COSTELLO FROM THE CHAMBERMAID SHE WAS VERY QUIET AND VERY COMME IL FAUT SHE WORE WHITE PUFFS SHE SPOKE TO NO ONE

1509-143477-0060 HER PRETTINESS WAS STILL VISIBLE IN THE DARKNESS SHE WAS OPENING AND CLOSING HER ENORMOUS FAN SHE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW ME SHE SAID SUDDENLY WHY DON'T YOU SAY SO
