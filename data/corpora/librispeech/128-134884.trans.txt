128-134884-0000 LET ME NOW APPLY THE PRINCIPLES ANNOUNCED IN THE PRECEDING LETTERS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN SPECIES MAN WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD
128-134884-0001 EVEN MORE WIDELY EXTENDED THAN THE LION AND TIGER BECAUSE WHEN HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY HE KILLS WITHOUT EATING A NATION OF HUNTERS
128-134884-0002 ON A LIMITED SPACE IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF INCREASING ITS NUMBERS BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT WHICH IS SOON ATTAINED THE CARBON NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION MUST BE OBTAINED FROM THE ANIMALS
128-134884-0003 OF WHICH ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER CAN LIVE ON THE SPACE SUPPOSED THESE ANIMALS COLLECT FROM PLANTS THE CONSTITUENTS OF THEIR ORGANS AND OF THEIR BLOOD AND YIELD THEM IN TURN TO THE SAVAGES WHO LIVE BY THE CHASE ALONE
128-134884-0004 THEY AGAIN RECEIVE THIS FOOD UNACCOMPANIED BY THOSE COMPOUNDS DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN WHICH DURING THE LIFE OF THE ANIMALS SERVED TO SUPPORT THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN SUCH MEN
128-134884-0005 CONFINED TO AN ANIMAL DIET IT IS THE CARBON OF THE FLESH AND OF THE BLOOD WHICH MUST TAKE THE PLACE OF STARCH AND SUGAR
128-134884-0006 AND WHILE THE SAVAGE WITH ONE ANIMAL
128-134884-0007 HE WOULD BE COMPELLED IF CONFINED TO FLESH ALONE IN ORDER TO PROCURE THE CARBON NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION DURING THE SAME TIME TO CONSUME FIVE SUCH ANIMALS IT IS EASY TO SEE FROM THESE CONSIDERATIONS
128-134884-0008 HOW CLOSE THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES THE CULTIVATION OF OUR CROPS HAS ULTIMATELY NO OTHER OBJECT THAN THE PRODUCTION OF A MAXIMUM OF THOSE SUBSTANCES
128-134884-0009 WHICH ARE ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION AND RESPIRATION IN THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE GRAIN AND OTHER NUTRITIOUS VEGETABLES YIELD US NOT ONLY IN STARCH SUGAR AND GUM THE CARBON WHICH PROTECTS OUR ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF OXYGEN
128-134884-0010 AND PRODUCES IN THE ORGANISM THE HEAT WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE BUT ALSO IN THE FORM OF VEGETABLE FIBRINE ALBUMEN AND CASEINE OUR BLOOD FROM WHICH THE OTHER PARTS OF OUR BODY ARE DEVELOPED MAN
128-134884-0011 WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD RESPIRES LIKE THE CARNIVORA AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MATTERS PRODUCED BY THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED TISSUES AND
128-134884-0012 HYAENA IN THE CAGES OF A MENAGERIE ARE COMPELLED TO ACCELERATE THE WASTE OF THE ORGANISED TISSUES BY INCESSANT MOTION IN ORDER TO FURNISH THE MATTER NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION SO THE SAVAGE FOR THE VERY SAME OBJECT
128-134884-0013 IS FORCED TO MAKE THE MOST LABORIOUS EXERTIONS AND GO THROUGH A VAST AMOUNT OF MUSCULAR EXERCISE HE IS COMPELLED TO CONSUME FORCE MERELY IN ORDER TO SUPPLY MATTER FOR RESPIRATION CULTIVATION IS THE ECONOMY OF FORCE
128-134884-0014 AND WITH GIVEN MEANS TO PRODUCE A MAXIMUM OF FORCE THE UNPROFITABLE EXERTION OF POWER THE WASTE OF FORCE IN AGRICULTURE IN OTHER BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY IN SCIENCE OR IN SOCIAL ECONOMY
128-134884-0015 IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SAVAGE STATE OR OF THE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT I HAVE ALREADY STATED YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT THE SUBSTANCES OF WHICH THE FOOD OF MAN IS COMPOSED MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES
128-134884-0016 INTO NITROGENISED AND NON NITROGENISED THE FORMER ARE CAPABLE OF CONVERSION INTO BLOOD THE LATTER ARE INCAPABLE OF THIS TRANSFORMATION
128-134884-0017 OUT OF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD ARE FORMED ALL THE ORGANISED TISSUES THE OTHER CLASS OF SUBSTANCES IN THE NORMAL STATE OF HEALTH
128-134884-0018 SERVE TO SUPPORT THE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION THE FORMER MAY BE CALLED THE PLASTIC ELEMENTS OF NUTRITION THE LATTER ELEMENTS OF RESPIRATION AMONG THE FORMER WE RECKON
128-134884-0019 VEGETABLE FIBRINE VEGETABLE ALBUMEN VEGETABLE CASEINE ANIMAL FLESH ANIMAL BLOOD AMONG THE ELEMENTS OF RESPIRATION IN OUR FOOD ARE
128-134884-0020 FAT PECTINE STARCH BASSORINE GUM WINE CANE SUGAR BEER GRAPE SUGAR SPIRITS SUGAR OF MILK
128-134884-0021 THE MOST RECENT AND EXACT RESEARCHES HAVE ESTABLISHED AS A UNIVERSAL FACT TO WHICH NOTHING YET KNOWN IS OPPOSED THAT THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF VEGETABLE FOOD
128-134884-0022 HAVE A COMPOSITION IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD NO NITROGENISED COMPOUND THE COMPOSITION OF WHICH DIFFERS FROM THAT OF FIBRINE ALBUMEN AND CASEINE
128-134884-0023 IS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE VITAL PROCESS IN ANIMALS THE ANIMAL ORGANISM UNQUESTIONABLY POSSESSES THE POWER OF FORMING FROM THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD
128-134884-0024 OF THE NERVES AND BRAIN AND OF THE ORGANIC PART OF CARTILAGES AND BONES BUT THE BLOOD MUST BE SUPPLIED TO IT PERFECT IN EVERYTHING BUT ITS FORM THAT IS IN ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
128-134884-0025 IF THIS BE NOT DONE A PERIOD IS RAPIDLY PUT TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD AND CONSEQUENTLY TO LIFE THIS CONSIDERATION ENABLES US EASILY TO EXPLAIN HOW IT HAPPENS
128-134884-0026 THAT THE TISSUES YIELDING GELATINE OR CHONDRINE AS FOR EXAMPLE THE GELATINE OF SKIN OR OF BONES ARE NOT ADAPTED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE VITAL PROCESS FOR THEIR COMPOSITION IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF FIBRINE OR ALBUMEN
128-134884-0027 IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ELEMENTS OF GELATINE OR OF THOSE TISSUES WHICH CONTAIN IT THE GELATINOUS TISSUES THE GELATINE OF THE BONES THE MEMBRANES THE CELLS AND THE SKIN SUFFER IN THE ANIMAL BODY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OXYGEN AND MOISTURE
128-134884-0028 A PROGRESSIVE ALTERATION A PART OF THESE TISSUES IS SEPARATED AND MUST BE RESTORED FROM THE BLOOD BUT THIS ALTERATION AND RESTORATION ARE OBVIOUSLY CONFINED WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS
128-134884-0029 WHILE IN THE BODY OF A STARVING OR SICK INDIVIDUAL THE FAT DISAPPEARS AND THE MUSCULAR TISSUE TAKES ONCE MORE THE FORM OF BLOOD WE FIND THAT THE TENDONS AND MEMBRANES RETAIN THEIR NATURAL CONDITION
128-134884-0030 AND THE LIMBS OF THE DEAD BODY THEIR CONNECTIONS WHICH DEPEND ON THE GELATINOUS TISSUES ON THE OTHER HAND WE SEE THAT THE GELATINE OF BONES DEVOURED BY A DOG ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS
128-134884-0031 WHILE ONLY THE BONE EARTH IS FOUND IN HIS EXCREMENTS THE SAME IS TRUE OF MAN WHEN FED ON FOOD RICH IN GELATINE AS FOR EXAMPLE STRONG SOUP THE GELATINE IS NOT TO BE FOUND EITHER IN THE URINE OR IN THE FAECES AND CONSEQUENTLY
128-134884-0032 MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CHANGE AND MUST HAVE SERVED SOME PURPOSE IN THE ANIMAL ECONOMY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GELATINE MUST BE EXPELLED FROM THE BODY IN A FORM DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH IT WAS INTRODUCED AS FOOD
128-134884-0033 WHEN WE CONSIDER THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ALBUMEN OF THE BLOOD INTO A PART OF AN ORGAN COMPOSED OF FIBRINE THE IDENTITY IN COMPOSITION OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES RENDERS THE CHANGE EASILY CONCEIVABLE INDEED
128-134884-0034 NATURAL AND EASILY EXPLAINED ON ACCOUNT OF THIS VERY IDENTITY OF COMPOSITION
128-134884-0035 THAT GELATINE WHEN TAKEN IN THE DISSOLVED STATE IS AGAIN CONVERTED IN THE BODY INTO CELLULAR TISSUE MEMBRANE AND CARTILAGE
128-134884-0036 AND FOR THEIR GROWTH AND WHEN THE POWERS OF NUTRITION IN THE WHOLE BODY ARE AFFECTED BY A CHANGE OF THE HEALTH THEN
128-134884-0037 THE ORGANIC FORCE BY WHICH THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD ARE TRANSFORMED INTO CELLULAR TISSUE AND MEMBRANES MUST NECESSARILY BE ENFEEBLED BY SICKNESS IN THE SICK MAN THE INTENSITY OF THE VITAL FORCE ITS POWER TO PRODUCE METAMORPHOSES
128-134884-0038 MUST BE DIMINISHED AS WELL IN THE STOMACH AS IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY IN THIS CONDITION THE UNIFORM EXPERIENCE OF PRACTICAL PHYSICIANS SHOWS THAT GELATINOUS MATTERS IN A DISSOLVED STATE EXERCISE A MOST DECIDED INFLUENCE ON THE STATE OF THE HEALTH
128-134884-0039 GIVEN IN A FORM ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION THEY SERVE TO HUSBAND THE VITAL FORCE JUST AS MAY BE DONE IN THE CASE OF THE STOMACH BY DUE PREPARATION OF THE FOOD IN GENERAL
128-134884-0040 BRITTLENESS IN THE BONES OF GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMALS IS CLEARLY OWING TO A WEAKNESS IN THOSE PARTS OF THE ORGANISM WHOSE FUNCTION IT IS TO CONVERT THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD INTO CELLULAR TISSUE AND MEMBRANE
128-134884-0041 AND IF WE CAN TRUST TO THE REPORTS OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE RESIDED IN THE EAST
