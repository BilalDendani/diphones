3132-163510-0000 THE WIFE WAS BROUGHT TO BED AND HAD A PRETTY GIRL BUT THEY WERE SO POOR THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO GET THE BABE CHRISTENED FOR THEY HAD NO MONEY TO PAY THE PARSON'S FEES SO ONE DAY
3132-163510-0001 THE FATHER WENT OUT TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND ANY ONE WHO WAS WILLING TO STAND FOR THE CHILD AND PAY THE FEES BUT THOUGH HE WALKED ABOUT THE WHOLE DAY FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER AND THOUGH
3132-163510-0002 ALL SAID THEY WERE WILLING ENOUGH TO STAND NO ONE THOUGHT HIMSELF BOUND TO PAY THE FEES NOW WHEN HE WAS GOING HOME AGAIN A LOVELY LADY MET HIM
3132-163510-0003 DRESSED SO FINE AND WHO LOOKED SO THOROUGHLY GOOD AND KIND SHE OFFERED TO GET THE BABE CHRISTENED BUT AFTER THAT SHE SAID SHE MUST KEEP IT FOR HER OWN THE HUSBAND ANSWERED
3132-163510-0004 HE MUST FIRST ASK HIS WIFE WHAT SHE WISHED TO DO BUT WHEN HE GOT HOME AND TOLD HIS STORY THE WIFE SAID RIGHT OUT NO
3132-163510-0005 NEXT DAY THE MAN WENT OUT AGAIN BUT NO ONE WOULD STAND IF THEY HAD TO PAY THE FEES AND THOUGH HE BEGGED AND PRAYED HE COULD GET NO HELP AND AGAIN AS HE WENT HOME TOWARDS EVENING
3132-163510-0006 THE SAME LOVELY LADY MET HIM WHO LOOKED SO SWEET AND GOOD AND SHE MADE HIM THE SAME OFFER SO HE TOLD HIS WIFE AGAIN HOW HE HAD FARED AND
3132-163510-0007 THEY MUST JUST LET THE LADY HAVE HER WAY SINCE SHE SEEMED SO KIND AND GOOD
3132-163510-0008 HE GAVE HIS WORD SHE SHOULD HAVE THE BABE IF SHE WOULD ONLY GET IT CHRISTENED AT THE FONT
3132-163510-0009 TWO MEN TO STAND GODFATHERS TOOK THE BABE AND CARRIED IT TO CHURCH
3132-163510-0010 AFTER THAT SHE TOOK IT TO HER OWN HOUSE AND THERE THE LITTLE GIRL LIVED WITH HER SEVERAL YEARS AND HER FOSTER MOTHER WAS ALWAYS KIND AND FRIENDLY TO HER
3132-163510-0011 RIGHT AND WRONG HER FOSTER MOTHER GOT READY TO GO ON A JOURNEY YOU HAVE MY
3132-163510-0012 AND WHEN SHE HAD SAID THAT AWAY SHE WENT BUT THE LASSIE COULD NOT FORBEAR JUST TO OPEN ONE OF THE DOORS A LITTLE BIT WHEN POP OUT FLEW A STAR
3132-163510-0013 THREATENED TO SEND HER AWAY BUT THE CHILD CRIED AND BEGGED SO HARD THAT SHE GOT LEAVE TO STAY NOW AFTER A WHILE THE FOSTER MOTHER HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOURNEY
3132-163510-0014 AND BEFORE SHE WENT SHE FORBADE THE LASSIE TO GO INTO THOSE TWO ROOMS INTO WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SHE PROMISED TO BEWARE BUT WHEN SHE WAS LEFT ALONE
3132-163510-0015 AND AT LAST SHE COULD NOT HELP SETTING THE DOOR A LITTLE AJAR JUST TO PEEP IN WHEN POP
3132-163510-0016 WHEN HER FOSTER MOTHER CAME HOME AND FOUND THE MOON LET OUT SHE WAS VERY DOWNCAST AND SAID TO THE LASSIE SHE MUST GO AWAY SHE COULD NOT STAY WITH HER ANY LONGER BUT
3132-163510-0017 THE LASSIE WEPT SO BITTERLY AND PRAYED SO HEARTILY FOR FORGIVENESS THAT THIS TIME TOO SHE GOT LEAVE TO STAY SOME TIME AFTER THE FOSTER MOTHER HAD TO GO AWAY AGAIN
3132-163510-0018 INTO OR TO PEEP INTO THE THIRD ROOM BUT WHEN HER FOSTER MOTHER HAD BEEN GONE SOME TIME
3132-163510-0019 WALKING ABOUT ALONE ALL AT ONCE SHE THOUGHT DEAR ME WHAT FUN IT WOULD BE JUST TO PEEP A LITTLE INTO THAT THIRD ROOM
3132-163510-0020 WHEN THE BAD THOUGHT CAME THE SECOND TIME SHE COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER COME WHAT MIGHT SHE MUST AND WOULD LOOK INTO THE ROOM SO SHE JUST OPENED THE DOOR
3132-163510-0021 BIT WHEN POP OUT FLEW THE SUN BUT WHEN HER FOSTER MOTHER CAME BACK AND
3132-163510-0022 THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT THE LASSIE MUST AND SHOULD GO AWAY SHE COULDN'T HEAR OF HER STAYING ANY LONGER NOW THE LASSIE CRIED HER EYES OUT AND BEGGED AND PRAYED SO PRETTILY
3132-163510-0023 BUT IT WAS ALL NO GOOD NAY BUT I MUST PUNISH YOU SAID HER FOSTER MOTHER BUT YOU MAY HAVE YOUR CHOICE EITHER TO BE THE LOVELIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD AND NOT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK OR TO KEEP YOUR
3132-163510-0024 SPEECH AND BE THE UGLIEST OF ALL WOMEN BUT AWAY FROM ME YOU MUST GO AND THE LASSIE SAID I WOULD SOONER BE LOVELY SO SHE BECAME ALL AT ONCE WONDROUS FAIR BUT FROM THAT DAY FORTH SHE WAS DUMB SO
3132-163510-0025 BUT THE FARTHER SHE WENT THE FARTHER OFF THE END SEEMED TO BE
3132-163510-0026 SHE MADE HERSELF UP TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT
3132-163510-0027 SO THE MAID LOOKED DOWN INTO THE SPRING
3132-163510-0028 AND THOUGHT IT WAS HER OWN THEN SHE FLUNG AWAY THE PITCHER AND RAN HOME AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE SHE TOSSED UP HER HEAD AND SAID IF I'M SO PRETTY I'M FAR TOO GOOD TO GO AND FETCH WATER SO
3132-163510-0029 ANOTHER MAID HAD TO GO FOR THE WATER BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO HER SHE WENT BACK AND SAID SHE WAS FAR TOO PRETTY AND
3132-163510-0030 THEN THE PRINCE WENT HIMSELF FOR HE HAD A MIND TO SEE WHAT ALL THIS COULD MEAN SO WHEN HE REACHED THE SPRING HE TOO SAW THE IMAGE IN THE WATER
3132-163510-0031 TOOK HER HOME AND AT LAST MADE UP HIS MIND TO HAVE HER FOR HIS QUEEN BECAUSE SHE WAS SO LOVELY BUT HIS MOTHER WHO WAS STILL ALIVE WAS AGAINST IT SHE CAN'T SPEAK SHE SAID AND MAYBE SHE'S A WICKED WITCH
3132-163510-0032 BUT THE PRINCE COULD NOT BE CONTENT TILL HE GOT HER SO AFTER THEY HAD LIVED TOGETHER A WHILE THE LASSIE WAS TO HAVE A CHILD AND
3132-163510-0033 WHEN THE CHILD CAME TO BE BORN THE PRINCE SET A STRONG WATCH ROUND HER BUT AT THE BIRTH ONE AND ALL FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP AND HER FOSTER MOTHER CAME CUT THE BABE ON ITS LITTLE FINGER AND
3132-163510-0034 BUT WHEN THOSE WHO WERE ON THE WATCH WOKE THEY THOUGHT THE QUEEN HAD EATEN HER OWN CHILD AND THE OLD QUEEN WAS ALL FOR BURNING HER ALIVE BUT THE PRINCE WAS SO FOND OF HER THAT AT LAST HE BEGGED HER OFF BUT
3132-163510-0035 HE HAD HARD WORK TO SET HER FREE
3132-163510-0036 THE SAME THING HAPPENED OVER AGAIN ONLY THIS TIME HER FOSTER MOTHER SAID NOW YOU SHALL BE AS GRIEVED AS I WAS WHEN YOU LET THE MOON OUT
3132-163510-0037 AND THE QUEEN BEGGED AND PRAYED AND WEPT FOR WHEN HER FOSTER MOTHER WAS THERE SHE COULD SPEAK BUT IT WAS ALL NO GOOD AND NOW THE OLD QUEEN SAID SHE MUST BE BURNT
3132-163510-0038 JUST THE SAME THING HAPPENED HER FOSTER MOTHER CAME WHILE THE WATCH SLEPT TOOK THE BABE AND CUT ITS LITTLE FINGER
3132-163510-0039 GRIEVED AS SHE HAD BEEN
