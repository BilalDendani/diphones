6747-76101-0000 THE STRANGE POWDER OF THE JOU JOU PRIESTS DOCTOR WATSON CAREFULLY OPENED THE LITTLE ANTIQUE SILVER BOX WHICH WAS ABOUT THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF AN ORDINARY WATCH AND SHOWED THAT IT CONTAINED A GRAY POWDER
6747-76101-0001 AND A LITTLE GOLD MEASURE RESEMBLING A MINIATURE THIMBLE
6747-76101-0002 NEARLY EFFACING THE PECULIAR HIEROGLYPHICS
6747-76101-0003 I CONSIDER THIS HE SAID
6747-76101-0004 MY STAR EXHIBIT AS IT WERE THE POWDER POSSESSES SUCH WONDERFUL PROPERTIES AND IS SO UNLIKE ANY KNOWN DRUG THAT I HESITATE TO DESCRIBE ITS EFFECTS THAT IT IS A POWERFUL POISON THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
6747-76101-0005 WHAT IS ITS HISTORY ASKED DOCTOR FARRINGTON I PICKED IT UP IN LONDON GOT IT FROM BURRIDGE THE EXPLORER WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A YEAR'S TRIP IN THE INTERIOR OF WEST AFRICA
6747-76101-0006 HE WENT INTO BENIN CITY WITH THE ENGLISH WHEN THEY CLEANED OUT THE TOWN BURRIDGE SAYS HE TOOK IT FROM A DEAD JOU JOU PRIEST AND HE MADE ME PAY A PRETTY STIFF PRICE FOR IT IT IS A WONDERFUL DRUG ENTIRELY UNKNOWN OUTSIDE OF AFRICA
6747-76101-0007 BUT ITS PREPARATION IS A SECRET OF THE PRIESTS OF JOU JOU NOW I PROPOSE THAT WE EACH TAKE A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE POWDER TO NIGHT AND THEN DINE TOGETHER TO MORROW EVENING AND COMPARE NOTES I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU NOW IT PRODUCES STRANGE HALLUCINATIONS
6747-76101-0008 I TRIED IT ONCE MYSELF AND MY EXPERIENCE ON THAT OCCASION WAS TO SAY THE LEAST PECULIAR THEREFORE I AM MORE THAN ANXIOUS TO TRY IT AGAIN AND COMPARE NOTES WITH YOU AFTERWARDS AND I THINK I CAN PROMISE YOU A NEW AND NOVEL EXPERIENCE
6747-76101-0009 FARRINGTON AND FORSTER WERE PERFECTLY WILLING TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT WHICH WATSON HINTED PROMISED SUCH INTERESTING RESULTS
6747-76101-0010 AND MEET TOGETHER THE NEXT EVENING PROMPTLY AT THE TIME APPOINTED THE THREE MEN MET IN WATSON'S STUDY AND AFTER CIGARS HAD BEEN LIGHTED WATSON ASKED FARRINGTON TO BE THE FIRST TO RELATE HIS EXPERIENCE
6747-76101-0011 WHEREUPON THE DOCTOR DREW FROM HIS POCKET SEVERAL PAGES OF CLOSELY WRITTEN MANUSCRIPT AND BEGAN AS FOLLOWS AN AZTEC MUMMY
6747-76101-0012 I WAS STANDING IN A MUSEUM LOOKING AT A CASE OF MUMMIES
6747-76101-0013 FOUND IN A CLIFF DWELLING AND IT INTERESTED ME VERY MUCH IN SIZE IT WAS THAT OF A SMALL MAN AND WAS IN A FINE STATE OF PRESERVATION WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THE BONES OF THE LEGS WERE EXPOSED AND MORE OR LESS DISINTEGRATED IN SOME PLACES
6747-76101-0014 THE HANDS EVEN TO THE FINGER NAILS WERE PERFECT HOWEVER AND THERE WAS A SILVER RING ON THE INDEX FINGER ONE HAND GRASPED A LARGE STONE AXE THE HANDLE BEING MODERN THE RIGHT HAND RESTED ACROSS THE CHEST CLASPING A NECKLACE OF SILVER WIRE
6747-76101-0015 INTERESTING SPECIMEN IS IT NOT SAID A VOICE AT MY SIDE QUITE SO I REPLIED
6747-76101-0016 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT ASKED THE VOICE SHARPLY BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE AZTECS BURIED THEIR DEAD IN CLIFF DWELLINGS HOWEVER IT IS AN INTERESTING MUMMY AND IN A WONDERFUL STATE OF PRESERVATION I WAS SO INTERESTED IN EXAMINING THE MUMMY
6747-76101-0017 NOW HOWEVER I LOOKED UP AND SAW A TALL GAUNT FIGURE OF A MAN DRESSED IN A SUIT OF CORDUROY AND WEARING A BROAD BRIMMED HAT OR SOMBRERO SUCH AS IS GENERALLY WORN ON THE WESTERN PLAINS WELL HE REMARKED
6747-76101-0018 IN MY OPINION IT IS A PRETTY GOOD MUMMY I MADE IT MYSELF AND OUGHT TO KNOW EXCUSE ME WHAT DID YOU SAY I ASKED THINKING I HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD HIM ARIGHT I SAID THAT WAS ONE OF MY MUMMIES
6747-76101-0019 AND DURING MY TIME I FURNISHED MUSEUMS WITH A GREAT MANY INTERESTING AND VALUABLE SPECIMENS WHEN TRADE WAS SLOW I OCCASIONALLY HELPED NATURE A LITTLE
6747-76101-0020 HAVE YOU GIVEN UP THE BUSINESS I ASKED HAD TO BUT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM DEAD
6747-76101-0021 DID YOU INDEED I ANSWERED TRYING TO APPEAR INTERESTED THAT'S WHAT I DID BUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THAT MUMMY THERE WAS A SCIENTIFIC CHAP WHO CAME TO OUR PLACE AND WANTED TO BUY AZTEC RELICS

6747-76101-0023 WE PREPARED A FINE AZTEC MUMMY OF COURSE WE USED THE BODY OF AN INDIAN
6747-76101-0024 MY PARTNER WAS A CLEVER CHAP AND HE FIXED UP THE AXE AND THE SILVER NECKLACE
6747-76101-0025 WE PICKED OUT A GOOD SIZED CAVE
6747-76101-0026 AND COVERED HIM UP WITH DRY DUST THEN WE WET THE CLAY OVER HIM LEAVING THE FLOOR HARD AND SMOOTH AS BEFORE WE ALSO BURIED ABOUT FIFTY AXES AND TWO OR THREE HUNDRED ARROW HEADS AND HALF A DOZEN NICE SPECIMENS OF INDIAN POTTERY
6747-76101-0027 WHICH WE BURNED UP GOOD AND BLACK AFTER WE HAD SALTED THE CAVE TO OUR SATISFACTION WE PARTLY SEALED UP THE ENTRANCE AND RETURNED TO FLAGSTAFF WAS THAT ACTING QUITE FAIR FAIR WHY
6747-76101-0028 AND GONE TO ALL THE EXPENSE OF HIS CAR FARE AND OUTFIT
6747-76101-0029 IT WAS PHILANTHROPY MY DEAR SIR THE HEIGHT OF PHILANTHROPY WAS HE PLEASED WITH THE MUMMY PLEASED WHY BLESS YOUR DEAR INNOCENT SOUL HE SCREAMED WITH JOY LIKE A CHILD
6747-76101-0030 HE CARRIED ON SO THAT MY PARTNER NEARLY GAVE US AWAY HE WAS A CHUMP ABOUT SOME THINGS IF ANYTHING PLEASED HIM HE WOULD LAUGH AND HIS LAUGH SOUNDED LIKE THE BRAY OF A JACKASS WELL SIR WHEN THIS SCIENTIFIC CHAP GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES
6747-76101-0031 AND COMMENCED TO PAW THE EARTH AWAY FROM THE FAKE MUMMY MY PARTNER BEGAN TO GURGLE I KNEW WHAT WAS COMING AND PUNCHED HIM IN THE RIBS BUT IT DID NO GOOD
6747-76101-0032 MATTER SHOUTED MY PARD AND THEN HE ROARED AND YELLED AND HOWLED
6747-76101-0033 BUT PARD SAVED HIMSELF JUST IN TIME LOOK HE YELLED BETWEEN HIS PAROXYSMS OF LAUGHTER LOOK AT THAT BUZZARD OVER THERE I'M DAMNED IF HE AIN'T THE FUNNIEST BUZZARD I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE
6747-76101-0034 AND THEN HE ROARED AND YELLED AND JUMPED ABOUT LOOK AT HIM HE LAUGHED SEE HIM FLY DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING SO FUNNY I AM NOT SURE BUT WHAT THE SCIENTIST THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY BUT ANYHOW HE DIDN'T CATCH ON TO WHAT HE WAS LAUGHING AT
6747-76101-0035 AND PRETTY SOON WENT ON WITH HIS DIGGING WE STAYED THERE THREE DAYS AND DUG THE WHOLE PLACE UP AND TOOK BACK WITH US A BASKET FULL OF STONE AXES ARROW HEADS THREE LARGE PREHISTORIC VASES AND THE MUMMY
6747-76101-0036 FOR FEAR SOMETHING WOULD GET BROKEN AND WHEN WE GOT TO FLAGSTAFF HE SPENT TWO DAYS PACKING THE RELICS DO YOU CONSIDER THAT SORT OF THING QUITE HONORABLE I ASKED HONORABLE WHAT IS THAT YOU SAY YOU SQUINT EYED DUDE
6747-76101-0037 NOW MY BOY DON'T GET FRESH WITH ME JUST BECAUSE I AM DEAD AND CAN'T JUMP YOU I HASTENED TO PACIFY HIM
6747-76101-0038 I WOULD HAVE MARKED SQUARES ALL OVER YOUR BODY WITH A PIECE OF CHALK AND THEN PLAYED HOP SCOTCH ON YOU I MEANT NO OFFENCE I SAID HUMBLY MAYBE YOU DIDN'T BUT JUST YOU MAKE ANOTHER BREAK LIKE THAT AND I WON'T FORGET IT
6747-76101-0039 IS YOUR PARTNER DEAD I ASKED NO JIM IS NOT DEAD BY A LONG SHOT I WENT DOWN TO SEE HIM LAST WINTER AT HIS PLACE IN CALIFORNIA

6747-76101-0041 I TELL YOU HE IS AN ARTIST IN HIS LINE
6747-76101-0042 AND MADE A STACK OF MONEY LAST WINTER IN NAVAJO BLANKETS AND SCALP TRIMMED INDIAN ARMS AND SHIELDS IT IS THE SCALP TRIMMING WHICH CATCHES THE TOURIST
6747-76101-0043 FROM HOSPITALS THERE BUT WHEN HE IS SHORT HORSE HAIR DOES PRETTY WELL ESPECIALLY FOR OLD INDIAN SCALPS AND THEN NAVAJO BLANKETS HOLY SMOKE A GOLD MINE ISN'T IN IT
6747-76101-0044 AND SELL TO THE TOURIST FOR VARIOUS PRICES
6747-76101-0045 OH I TELL YOU HE IS SHREWD SOME DAY HE WILL BE WORTH A MILLION SOMETIMES A CHAP GOES INTO HIS SHOP AND POSES AS AN EXPERT

6747-76101-0047 THEN JIM WILL LOOK ABOUT AS THOUGH FEARFUL THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT SEE HIM AND WILL STEAL SOFTLY INTO A BACK ROOM AND PULL FROM BENEATH HIS BED A GOOD CHEAP BLANKET WORTH ABOUT THREE DOLLARS AND SPREAD IT OUT LOVINGLY IN FRONT OF THE TOURIST
6747-76101-0048 THERE HE WHISPERS LOOK AT THAT THAT IS NOT FOR SALE I AM KEEPING THAT FOR MYSELF BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT AS IT IS VERY EVIDENT YOU KNOW A GOOD DEAL ABOUT BLANKETS ISN'T IT A BEAUTY
6747-76101-0049 AND FINE PRESERVATION OF THE NATIVE WOOL PREPARED IN THE MANNER OF THE OLD NAVAJO SPEAKS OF ITS GREAT RARITY AND AT LAST ENDS BY ASKING JIM WHAT HE WILL TAKE FOR IT AND USUALLY CARRIES IT AWAY WITH HIM HAVING PAID THREE OR FOUR TIMES THE VALUE OF A REALLY GOOD BLANKET
6747-76101-0050 WELL HE SAID I MUST BE GOING
