4563-26445-0000 WITHOUT SPEAKING TO US WITHOUT LOOKING AT US SHE LED THE WAY DOWN THE DARK GARDEN WALK AND LOCKED THE GATE BEHIND US GOOD NIGHT ARIEL I CALLED OUT TO HER OVER THE PALING
4563-26445-0001 THE FOOTMAN HAD THOUGHTFULLY LIGHTED THE CARRIAGE LAMPS CARRYING ONE OF THEM TO SERVE AS A LANTERN HE LIGHTED US OVER THE WILDS OF THE BRICK DESERT AND LANDED US SAFELY ON THE PATH BY THE HIGH ROAD WELL SAID MY MOTHER IN LAW WHEN WE WERE COMFORTABLY SEATED IN THE CARRIAGE AGAIN
4563-26445-0002 YOU HAVE SEEN MISERRIMUS DEXTER AND I HOPE YOU ARE SATISFIED
4563-26445-0003 BUT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I'M NOT QUITE SURE THAT HE IS MAD NOT MAD CRIED MISSUS MACALLAN AFTER THOSE FRANTIC PERFORMANCES IN HIS CHAIR NOT MAD AFTER THE EXHIBITION HE MADE OF HIS UNFORTUNATE COUSIN
4563-26445-0004 NOT MAD AFTER THE SONG THAT HE SANG IN YOUR HONOR AND THE FALLING ASLEEP BY WAY OF CONCLUSION OH VALERIA VALERIA WELL SAID THE WISDOM OF OUR ANCESTORS THERE ARE NONE SO BLIND AS THOSE WHO WON'T SEE
4563-26445-0005 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE ONLY EXPRESSES I ADMIT IN A VERY RECKLESS AND BOISTEROUS WAY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS WHICH MOST OF US ARE ASHAMED OF AS WEAKNESSES AND WHICH WE KEEP TO OURSELVES ACCORDINGLY
4563-26445-0006 I CONFESS I HAVE OFTEN FANCIED MYSELF TRANSFORMED INTO SOME OTHER PERSON AND HAVE FELT A CERTAIN PLEASURE IN SEEING MYSELF IN MY NEW CHARACTER
4563-26445-0007 BUT I NOTICED THAT WHEN HIS IMAGINATION COOLED DOWN HE BECAME MISERRIMUS DEXTER AGAIN HE NO MORE BELIEVED HIMSELF THAN WE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NAPOLEON OR SHAKESPEARE
4563-26445-0008 I HOPE THE CONFESSION WILL NOT LOWER ME SERIOUSLY IN YOUR GOOD OPINION BUT I MUST SAY I HAVE ENJOYED MY VISIT AND WORSE STILL MISERRIMUS DEXTER REALLY INTERESTS ME
4563-26445-0009 ASKED MISSUS MACALLAN I DON'T KNOW HOW I MAY FEEL ABOUT IT TOMORROW MORNING I SAID BUT MY IMPULSE AT THIS MOMENT IS DECIDEDLY TO SEE HIM AGAIN I HAD A LITTLE TALK WITH HIM WHILE YOU WERE AWAY AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AND I BELIEVE HE REALLY CAN BE OF USE TO ME
4563-26445-0010 OF USE TO YOU IN WHAT INTERPOSED MY MOTHER IN LAW IN THE ONE OBJECT WHICH I HAVE IN VIEW THE OBJECT DEAR MISSUS MACALLAN WHICH I REGRET TO SAY YOU DO NOT APPROVE AND YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE HIM INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE
4563-26445-0011 TO OPEN YOUR WHOLE MIND TO SUCH A MAN AS THE MAN WE HAVE JUST LEFT YES IF I THINK OF IT TO MORROW AS I THINK OF IT TO NIGHT I DARE SAY IT IS A RISK BUT I MUST RUN RISKS
4563-26445-0012 I KNOW I AM NOT PRUDENT BUT PRUDENCE WON'T HELP A WOMAN IN MY POSITION WITH MY END TO GAIN MISSUS MACALLAN MADE NO FURTHER REMONSTRANCE IN WORDS SHE OPENED A CAPACIOUS POCKET IN FRONT OF THE CARRIAGE AND TOOK FROM IT A BOX OF MATCHES AND A RAILWAY READING LAMP
4563-26445-0013 YOU PROVOKE ME SAID THE OLD LADY INTO SHOWING YOU WHAT YOUR HUSBAND THINKS OF THIS NEW WHIM OF YOURS I HAVE GOT HIS LETTER WITH ME HIS LAST LETTER FROM SPAIN
4563-26445-0014 THE USELESS AND HOPELESS SACRIFICE WHICH YOU ARE BENT ON MAKING OF YOURSELF FOR HIS SAKE STRIKE A LIGHT I WILLINGLY OBEYED HER
4563-26445-0015 EVER SINCE SHE HAD INFORMED ME OF EUSTACE'S DEPARTURE TO SPAIN I HAD BEEN EAGER FOR MORE NEWS OF HIM FOR SOMETHING TO SUSTAIN MY SPIRITS AFTER SO MUCH THAT HAD DISAPPOINTED AND DEPRESSED ME THUS FAR I DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHETHER MY HUSBAND THOUGHT OF ME SOMETIMES IN HIS SELF IMPOSED EXILE
4563-26445-0016 THE LAMP HAVING BEEN LIGHTED AND FIXED IN ITS PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO FRONT WINDOWS OF THE CARRIAGE MISSUS MACALLAN PRODUCED HER SON'S LETTER THERE IS NO FOLLY LIKE THE FOLLY OF LOVE IT COST ME A HARD STRUGGLE TO RESTRAIN MYSELF FROM KISSING THE PAPER ON WHICH THE DEAR HAND HAD RESTED
4563-26445-0017 THERE SAID MY MOTHER IN LAW BEGIN ON THE SECOND PAGE THE PAGE DEVOTED TO YOU READ STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE LAST LINE AT THE BOTTOM AND IN GOD'S NAME COME BACK TO YOUR SENSES CHILD BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE I FOLLOWED MY INSTRUCTIONS AND READ THESE WORDS
4563-26445-0018 I MUST WRITE OF HER TELL ME HOW SHE IS HOW SHE LOOKS WHAT SHE IS DOING I AM ALWAYS THINKING OF HER NOT A DAY PASSES BUT I MOURN THE LOSS OF HER
4563-26445-0019 OH IF SHE HAD NEVER DISCOVERED THE MISERABLE TRUTH SHE SPOKE OF READING THE TRIAL WHEN I SAW HER LAST HAS SHE PERSISTED IN DOING SO I BELIEVE I SAY THIS SERIOUSLY MOTHER I BELIEVE THE SHAME AND THE HORROR OF IT
4563-26445-0020 WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF ME IF I HAD MET HER FACE TO FACE WHEN SHE FIRST KNEW OF THE IGNOMINY THAT I HAVE SUFFERED OF THE INFAMOUS SUSPICION OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY MADE THE SUBJECT THINK OF THOSE PURE EYES LOOKING AT A MAN WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED
4563-26445-0021 AND THEN THINK OF WHAT THAT MAN MUST FEEL IF HE HAVE ANY HEART AND ANY SENSE OF SHAME LEFT IN HIM I SICKEN AS I WRITE OF IT DOES SHE STILL MEDITATE THAT HOPELESS PROJECT THE OFFSPRING POOR ANGEL OF HER ARTLESS UNTHINKING GENEROSITY
4563-26445-0022 FOR HER SAKE FOR MY SAKE LEAVE NO MEANS UNTRIED TO ATTAIN THIS RIGHTEOUS THIS MERCIFUL END I SEND HER NO MESSAGE I DARE NOT DO IT
4563-26445-0023 ON THE CONTRARY HELP HER TO FORGET ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE KINDEST THING I CAN DO THE ONE ATONEMENT I CAN MAKE TO HER IS TO DROP OUT OF HER LIFE WITH THOSE WRETCHED WORDS IT ENDED I HANDED HIS LETTER BACK TO HIS MOTHER IN SILENCE
4563-26445-0024 SHE SAID BUT LITTLE ON HER SIDE IF THIS DOESN'T DISCOURAGE YOU SHE REMARKED SLOWLY FOLDING UP THE LETTER NOTHING WILL LET US LEAVE IT THERE AND SAY NO MORE I MADE NO ANSWER I WAS CRYING BEHIND MY VEIL
4563-26445-0025 MY DOMESTIC PROSPECT LOOKED SO DREARY
4563-26445-0026 THE ONE CHANCE FOR BOTH OF US AND THE ONE CONSOLATION FOR POOR ME WAS TO HOLD TO MY DESPERATE RESOLUTION MORE FIRMLY THAN EVER
4563-26445-0027 IF I HAD WANTED ANYTHING TO CONFIRM ME IN THIS VIEW AND TO ARM ME AGAINST THE REMONSTRANCES OF EVERY ONE OF MY FRIENDS EUSTACE'S LETTER WOULD HAVE PROVED MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER THE PURPOSE AT LEAST HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN ME
4563-26445-0028 HE THOUGHT OF ME AND HE MOURNED THE LOSS OF ME EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE THAT WAS ENCOURAGEMENT ENOUGH FOR THE PRESENT IF ARIEL CALLS FOR ME IN THE PONY CHAISE TO MORROW I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WITH ARIEL I GO
4563-26445-0029 MISSUS MACALLAN SET ME DOWN AT BENJAMIN'S DOOR I MENTIONED TO HER AT PARTING I STOOD SUFFICIENTLY IN AWE OF HER TO PUT IT OFF TILL THE LAST MOMENT THAT MISERRIMUS DEXTER HAD ARRANGED TO SEND HIS COUSIN AND HIS PONY CHAISE TO HER RESIDENCE ON THE NEXT DAY
4563-26445-0030 AND I INQUIRED THEREUPON WHETHER MY MOTHER IN LAW WOULD PERMIT ME TO CALL AT HER HOUSE TO WAIT FOR THE APPEARANCE OF THE COUSIN OR WHETHER SHE WOULD PREFER SENDING THE CHAISE ON TO BENJAMIN'S COTTAGE I FULLY EXPECTED AN EXPLOSION OF ANGER TO FOLLOW THIS BOLD AVOWAL OF MY PLANS FOR THE NEXT DAY
4563-26445-0031 THE OLD LADY AGREEABLY SURPRISED ME SHE PROVED THAT SHE HAD REALLY TAKEN A LIKING TO ME SHE KEPT HER TEMPER IF YOU PERSIST IN GOING BACK TO DEXTER YOU CERTAINLY SHALL NOT GO TO HIM FROM MY DOOR SHE SAID BUT I HOPE YOU WILL NOT PERSIST
4563-26445-0032 I HOPE YOU WILL AWAKE A WISER WOMAN TO MORROW MORNING THE MORNING CAME
4563-26445-0033 I HAVE NO RIGHT TO CONTROL YOUR MOVEMENTS MY MOTHER IN LAW WROTE I SEND THE CHAISE TO MISTER BENJAMIN'S HOUSE AND I SINCERELY TRUST THAT YOU WILL NOT TAKE YOUR PLACE IN IT I WISH I COULD PERSUADE YOU VALERIA HOW TRULY I AM YOUR FRIEND
4563-26445-0034 I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU ANXIOUSLY IN THE WAKEFUL HOURS OF THE NIGHT HOW ANXIOUSLY YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I NOW REPROACH MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING DONE MORE THAN I DID TO PREVENT YOUR UNHAPPY MARRIAGE AND YET WHAT MORE I COULD HAVE DONE I DON'T REALLY KNOW
4563-26445-0035 MY SON ADMITTED TO ME THAT HE WAS COURTING YOU UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME BUT HE NEVER TOLD ME WHAT THE NAME WAS
4563-26445-0036 I HONESTLY THOUGHT I DID MY DUTY IN EXPRESSING MY DISAPPROVAL AND IN REFUSING TO BE PRESENT AT THE MARRIAGE WAS I TOO EASILY SATISFIED IT IS TOO LATE TO ASK WHY DO I TROUBLE YOU WITH AN OLD WOMAN'S VAIN MISGIVINGS AND REGRETS
4563-26445-0037 MY CHILD IF YOU COME TO ANY HARM I SHALL FEEL INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR IT
4563-26445-0038 WRITE HIM AN EXCUSE VALERIA I FIRMLY BELIEVE YOU WILL REPENT IT IF YOU RETURN TO THAT HOUSE WAS EVER A WOMAN MORE PLAINLY WARNED MORE CAREFULLY ADVISED THAN I AND YET WARNING AND ADVICE WERE BOTH THROWN AWAY ON ME
4563-26445-0039 AS LONG AS I LIVED MOVED AND THOUGHT MY ONE PURPOSE NOW WAS TO MAKE MISERRIMUS DEXTER CONFIDE TO ME HIS IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT OF MISSUS EUSTACE MACALLAN'S DEATH TO THOSE IDEAS I LOOKED AS MY GUIDING STARS ALONG THE DARK WAY ON WHICH I WAS GOING
4563-26445-0040 I WROTE BACK TO MISSUS MACALLAN AS I REALLY FELT GRATEFULLY AND PENITENTLY
