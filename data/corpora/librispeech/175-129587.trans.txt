175-129587-0000 THE HUNTING OF THE MAN IT CAME BEFORE MY MIND WITH AN UNREASONABLE HOPE OF ESCAPE THAT THE OUTER DOOR OF MY ROOM WAS STILL OPEN TO ME I WAS CONVINCED NOW ABSOLUTELY ASSURED
175-129587-0001 THAT MOREAU HAD BEEN VIVISECTING A HUMAN BEING ALL THE TIME SINCE I HAD HEARD HIS NAME I HAD BEEN TRYING TO LINK IN MY MIND IN SOME WAY THE GROTESQUE ANIMALISM OF THE ISLANDERS WITH HIS ABOMINATIONS AND NOW I THOUGHT I SAW IT ALL
175-129587-0002 THESE CREATURES I HAD SEEN WERE THE VICTIMS OF SOME HIDEOUS EXPERIMENT THESE SICKENING SCOUNDRELS HAD MERELY INTENDED TO KEEP ME BACK TO FOOL ME WITH THEIR DISPLAY OF CONFIDENCE AND PRESENTLY TO FALL UPON ME WITH A FATE MORE HORRIBLE THAN DEATH
175-129587-0003 WITH TORTURE AND AFTER TORTURE
175-129587-0004 TO SEND ME OFF A LOST SOUL A BEAST TO THE REST OF THEIR COMUS ROUT I LOOKED ROUND FOR SOME WEAPON NOTHING THEN WITH AN INSPIRATION I TURNED OVER THE DECK CHAIR PUT MY FOOT ON THE SIDE OF IT
175-129587-0005 AND TORE AWAY THE SIDE RAIL IT HAPPENED THAT A NAIL CAME AWAY WITH THE WOOD AND PROJECTING GAVE A TOUCH OF DANGER TO AN OTHERWISE PETTY WEAPON
175-129587-0006 AND FOUND MONTGOMERY WITHIN A YARD OF IT HE MEANT TO LOCK THE OUTER DOOR I RAISED THIS NAILED STICK OF MINE AND CUT AT HIS FACE BUT HE SPRANG BACK I HESITATED A MOMENT THEN TURNED AND FLED ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
175-129587-0007 AND AS READY AS A HOSPITAL RABBIT FOR MY FATE HE EMERGED BEHIND THE CORNER FOR I HEARD HIM SHOUT PRENDICK THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AFTER ME SHOUTING THINGS AS HE RAN THIS TIME RUNNING BLINDLY
175-129587-0008 I WENT NORTHEASTWARD IN A DIRECTION AT RIGHT ANGLES TO MY PREVIOUS EXPEDITION ONCE AS I WENT RUNNING HEADLONG UP THE BEACH I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER AND SAW HIS ATTENDANT WITH HIM I RAN FURIOUSLY UP THE SLOPE OVER IT
175-129587-0009 MY CHEST STRAINING MY HEART BEATING IN MY EARS AND THEN HEARING NOTHING OF MONTGOMERY OR HIS MAN AND FEELING UPON THE VERGE OF EXHAUSTION I DOUBLED SHARPLY BACK TOWARDS THE BEACH AS I JUDGED AND LAY DOWN IN THE SHELTER OF A CANEBRAKE
175-129587-0010 THERE I REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME TOO FEARFUL TO MOVE AND INDEED TOO FEARFUL EVEN TO PLAN A COURSE OF ACTION THE WILD SCENE ABOUT ME LAY SLEEPING SILENTLY UNDER THE SUN
175-129587-0011 AND THE ONLY SOUND NEAR ME WAS THE THIN HUM OF SOME SMALL GNATS THAT HAD DISCOVERED ME PRESENTLY I BECAME AWARE OF A DROWSY BREATHING SOUND
175-129587-0012 AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR I HEARD MONTGOMERY SHOUTING MY NAME FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH THAT SET ME THINKING OF MY PLAN OF ACTION AS I INTERPRETED IT THEN
175-129587-0013 THIS ISLAND WAS INHABITED ONLY BY THESE TWO VIVISECTORS AND THEIR ANIMALISED VICTIMS SOME OF THESE NO DOUBT THEY COULD PRESS INTO THEIR SERVICE AGAINST ME IF NEED AROSE I KNEW BOTH MOREAU AND MONTGOMERY CARRIED REVOLVERS
175-129587-0014 AND SAVE FOR A FEEBLE BAR OF DEAL SPIKED WITH A SMALL NAIL THE MEREST MOCKERY OF A MACE I WAS UNARMED
175-129587-0015 UNTIL I BEGAN TO THINK OF FOOD AND DRINK
175-129587-0016 I KNEW NO WAY OF GETTING ANYTHING TO EAT I WAS TOO IGNORANT OF BOTANY TO DISCOVER ANY RESORT OF ROOT OR FRUIT THAT MIGHT LIE ABOUT ME I HAD NO MEANS OF TRAPPING THE FEW RABBITS UPON THE ISLAND
175-129587-0017 IT GREW BLANKER THE MORE I TURNED THE PROSPECT OVER AT LAST IN THE DESPERATION OF MY POSITION MY MIND TURNED TO THE ANIMAL MEN I HAD ENCOUNTERED I TRIED TO FIND SOME HOPE IN WHAT I REMEMBERED OF THEM
175-129587-0018 IN TURN I RECALLED EACH ONE I HAD SEEN AND TRIED TO DRAW SOME AUGURY OF ASSISTANCE FROM MY MEMORY THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A STAGHOUND BAY AND AT THAT REALISED A NEW DANGER I TOOK LITTLE TIME TO THINK
175-129587-0019 BUT SNATCHING UP MY NAILED STICK RUSHED HEADLONG FROM MY HIDING PLACE TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE SEA I REMEMBER A GROWTH OF THORNY PLANTS WITH SPINES THAT STABBED LIKE PEN KNIVES I EMERGED BLEEDING AND WITH TORN CLOTHES UPON THE LIP OF A LONG CREEK OPENING NORTHWARD
175-129587-0020 WADING UP THE CREEK AND PRESENTLY FINDING MYSELF KNEEDEEP IN A LITTLE STREAM I SCRAMBLED OUT AT LAST ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND WITH MY HEART BEATING LOUDLY IN MY EARS CREPT INTO A TANGLE OF FERNS TO AWAIT THE ISSUE I HEARD THE DOG
175-129587-0021 DRAW NEARER AND YELP WHEN IT CAME TO THE THORNS THEN I HEARD NO MORE AND PRESENTLY BEGAN TO THINK I HAD ESCAPED THE MINUTES PASSED THE SILENCE LENGTHENED OUT AND AT LAST AFTER AN HOUR OF SECURITY MY COURAGE BEGAN TO RETURN TO ME
175-129587-0022 I REMEMBERED THAT IF I WERE TOO HARD PRESSED AT LEAST ONE PATH OF ESCAPE FROM TORMENT STILL LAY OPEN TO ME
175-129587-0023 I HAD HALF A MIND TO DROWN MYSELF THEN BUT AN ODD WISH TO SEE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OUT A QUEER IMPERSONAL SPECTACULAR INTEREST IN MYSELF RESTRAINED ME
175-129587-0024 I STRETCHED MY LIMBS SORE AND PAINFUL FROM THE PRICKS OF THE SPINY PLANTS AND STARED AROUND ME AT THE TREES
175-129587-0025 MY EYES LIT UPON A BLACK FACE WATCHING ME I SAW THAT IT WAS THE SIMIAN CREATURE WHO HAD MET THE LAUNCH UPON THE BEACH HE WAS CLINGING TO THE OBLIQUE STEM OF A PALM TREE I GRIPPED MY STICK AND STOOD UP FACING HIM
175-129587-0026 HE BEGAN CHATTERING YOU YOU YOU WAS ALL I COULD DISTINGUISH AT FIRST SUDDENLY HE DROPPED FROM THE TREE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT WAS HOLDING THE FRONDS APART AND STARING CURIOUSLY AT ME
175-129587-0027 YOU HE SAID IN THE BOAT HE WAS A MAN THEN AT LEAST AS MUCH OF A MAN AS MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT FOR HE COULD TALK YES I SAID I CAME IN THE BOAT FROM THE SHIP OH HE SAID
175-129587-0028 AND HIS BRIGHT RESTLESS EYES TRAVELLED OVER ME TO MY HANDS TO THE STICK I CARRIED TO MY FEET TO THE TATTERED PLACES IN MY COAT AND THE CUTS AND SCRATCHES I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE THORNS HE SEEMED PUZZLED AT SOMETHING HIS EYES CAME BACK TO MY HANDS
175-129587-0029 HE HELD HIS OWN HAND OUT AND COUNTED HIS DIGITS SLOWLY ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE EIGH I DID NOT GRASP HIS MEANING THEN
175-129587-0030 AFTERWARDS I WAS TO FIND THAT A GREAT PROPORTION OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE HAD MALFORMED HANDS LACKING SOMETIMES EVEN THREE DIGITS BUT GUESSING THIS WAS IN SOME WAY A GREETING I DID THE SAME THING BY WAY OF REPLY HE GRINNED WITH IMMENSE SATISFACTION
175-129587-0031 HE MADE A SWIFT MOVEMENT AND VANISHED THE FERN FRONDS HE HAD STOOD BETWEEN CAME SWISHING TOGETHER I PUSHED OUT OF THE BRAKE AFTER HIM AND WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HIM SWINGING CHEERFULLY BY ONE LANK ARM
175-129587-0032 FROM A ROPE OF CREEPERS THAT LOOPED DOWN FROM THE FOLIAGE OVERHEAD HIS BACK WAS TO ME HULLO SAID I HE CAME DOWN WITH A TWISTING JUMP AND STOOD FACING ME I SAY SAID I
175-129587-0033 WHERE CAN I GET SOMETHING TO EAT EAT HE SAID EAT MAN'S FOOD NOW
175-129587-0034 COME ALONG SAID HE I WENT WITH HIM TO SEE THE ADVENTURE OUT I GUESSED THE HUTS WERE SOME ROUGH SHELTER WHERE HE AND SOME MORE OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE LIVED I MIGHT PERHAPS FIND THEM FRIENDLY
175-129587-0035 FIND SOME HANDLE IN THEIR MINDS TO TAKE HOLD OF
175-129587-0036 MY APE LIKE COMPANION TROTTED ALONG BY MY SIDE WITH HIS HANDS HANGING DOWN AND HIS JAW THRUST FORWARD
175-129587-0037 HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON THIS ISLAND SAID I HOW LONG HE ASKED AND AFTER HAVING THE QUESTION REPEATED HE HELD UP THREE FINGERS THE CREATURE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN AN IDIOT
175-129587-0038 I TRIED TO MAKE OUT WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT AND IT SEEMS I BORED HIM AFTER ANOTHER QUESTION OR TWO
175-129587-0039 AND SO TO A BARE PLACE COVERED WITH A YELLOW WHITE INCRUSTATION
175-129587-0040 I SAW THE LEVEL BLUE OF THE SEA THE PATH COILED DOWN ABRUPTLY INTO A NARROW RAVINE BETWEEN TWO TUMBLED AND KNOTTY MASSES OF BLACKISH SCORIAE INTO THIS WE PLUNGED IT WAS EXTREMELY DARK THIS PASSAGE
175-129587-0041 AFTER THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SULPHUROUS GROUND
175-129587-0042 BLOTCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON DRIFTED ACROSS MY EYES MY CONDUCTOR STOPPED SUDDENLY HOME SAID HE AND I STOOD IN A FLOOR OF A CHASM THAT WAS AT FIRST ABSOLUTELY DARK TO ME
175-129587-0043 I HEARD SOME STRANGE NOISES AND THRUST THE KNUCKLES OF MY LEFT HAND INTO MY EYES I BECAME AWARE OF A DISAGREEABLE ODOR LIKE THAT OF A MONKEY'S CAGE ILL CLEANED BEYOND THE ROCK OPENED AGAIN UPON A GRADUAL SLOPE OF SUNLIT GREENERY
