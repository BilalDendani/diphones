255-121535-0011 AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS KEEN BLADE OF BRONZE SHARPENED ON BOTH SIDES AND WITH A LOUD CRY SPRANG TOWARDS ULYSSES BUT ULYSSES INSTANTLY SHOT AN ARROW INTO HIS BREAST THAT CAUGHT HIM BY THE NIPPLE AND FIXED ITSELF IN HIS LIVER
255-121535-0012 HIS TABLE THE CUP AND ALL THE MEATS WENT OVER ON TO THE GROUND AS HE SMOTE THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD IN THE AGONIES OF DEATH AND HE KICKED THE STOOL WITH HIS FEET UNTIL HIS EYES WERE CLOSED IN DARKNESS
255-121535-0013 SO THAT HE FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND AND STRUCK THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD THEN TELEMACHUS SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM LEAVING HIS SPEAR STILL IN THE BODY FOR HE FEARED THAT IF HE STAYED TO DRAW IT OUT
255-121535-0014 OR KNOCK HIM DOWN SO HE SET OFF AT A RUN AND IMMEDIATELY WAS AT HIS FATHER'S SIDE THEN HE SAID FATHER LET ME BRING YOU A SHIELD TWO SPEARS AND A BRASS HELMET FOR YOUR TEMPLES

255-121535-0018 HELP WOULD COME AT ONCE AND WE SHOULD SOON MAKE AN END OF THIS MAN AND HIS SHOOTING THIS MAY NOT BE AGELAUS ANSWERED MELANTHIUS THE MOUTH OF THE NARROW PASSAGE IS DANGEROUSLY NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE OUTER COURT

255-121535-0020 THAT HE HAS DONE IN YOUR HOUSE ULYSSES ANSWERED TELEMACHUS AND I WILL HOLD THESE SUITORS IN CHECK NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO
255-121535-0021 AND THEY DID EVEN AS HE HAD SAID THEY WENT TO THE STORE ROOM WHICH THEY ENTERED BEFORE MELANTHIUS SAW THEM FOR HE WAS BUSY SEARCHING FOR ARMS IN THE INNERMOST PART OF THE ROOM SO THE TWO TOOK THEIR STAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DOOR AND WAITED
255-121535-0022 BY AND BY MELANTHIUS CAME OUT WITH A HELMET IN ONE HAND AND AN OLD DRY ROTTED SHIELD IN THE OTHER
255-121535-0023 THEY BENT HIS HANDS AND FEET WELL BEHIND HIS BACK
255-121535-0024 O SWINEHERD EUMAEUS SAYING MELANTHIUS YOU WILL PASS THE NIGHT ON A SOFT BED AS YOU DESERVE
255-121535-0025 FIERCE AND FULL OF FURY NEVERTHELESS THOSE WHO WERE IN THE BODY OF THE COURT WERE STILL BOTH BRAVE AND MANY THEN
255-121535-0026 WE WILL KILL YOU TOO YOU SHALL PAY FOR IT WITH YOUR HEAD AND WHEN WE HAVE KILLED YOU WE WILL TAKE ALL YOU HAVE IN DOORS OR OUT AND BRING IT INTO HOTCH POT WITH ULYSSES PROPERTY

255-121535-0028 THAT YOU ARE SO LAMENTABLY LESS VALIANT NOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN GROUND FACE TO FACE WITH THE SUITORS IN YOUR OWN HOUSE COME ON MY GOOD FELLOW STAND BY MY SIDE AND SEE HOW MENTOR
255-121535-0029 AND REQUITE YOUR KINDNESSES CONFERRED UPON HIM BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM FULL VICTORY AS YET FOR SHE WISHED STILL FURTHER TO PROVE HIS OWN PROWESS AND THAT OF HIS BRAVE SON
255-121535-0030 SO SHE FLEW UP TO ONE OF THE RAFTERS IN THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER AND SAT UPON IT IN THE FORM OF A SWALLOW MEANWHILE
255-121535-0031 SON OF DAMASTOR EURYNOMUS AMPHIMEDON DEMOPTOLEMUS PISANDER AND POLYBUS SON OF POLYCTOR BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT UPON THE SUITORS SIDE
255-121535-0032 OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES THEY WERE BY FAR THE MOST VALIANT FOR THE OTHERS HAD ALREADY FALLEN UNDER THE ARROWS OF ULYSSES
255-121535-0033 MY FRIENDS HE WILL SOON HAVE TO LEAVE OFF FOR MENTOR HAS GONE AWAY AFTER HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR HIM BUT BRAG THEY ARE STANDING AT THE DOORS UNSUPPORTED DO NOT AIM AT HIM ALL AT ONCE
255-121535-0034 BUT MINERVA MADE THEM ALL OF NO EFFECT ONE HIT THE DOOR POST ANOTHER WENT AGAINST THE DOOR THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD AVOIDED ALL THE SPEARS OF THE SUITORS
255-121535-0035 BY KILLING US OUTRIGHT THEY THEREFORE AIMED STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND THREW THEIR SPEARS ULYSSES KILLED DEMOPTOLEMUS TELEMACHUS EURYADES EUMAEUS ELATUS
255-121535-0036 WHILE THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL STILL AMPHIMEDON JUST TOOK A PIECE OF THE TOP SKIN FROM OFF TELEMACHUS'S WRIST
255-121535-0037 ABOVE HIS SHIELD BUT THE SPEAR WENT ON AND FELL TO THE GROUND THEN ULYSSES AND HIS MEN LET DRIVE INTO THE CROWD OF SUITORS
255-121535-0038 FOR THE FOOT WHICH YOU GAVE ULYSSES WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ABOUT IN HIS OWN HOUSE THUS SPOKE THE STOCKMAN AND ULYSSES STRUCK THE SON OF DAMASTOR WITH A SPEAR IN CLOSE FIGHT
255-121535-0039 AND THE DART WENT CLEAN THROUGH HIM SO THAT HE FELL FORWARD FULL ON HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND THEN MINERVA FROM HER SEAT ON THE RAFTER
255-121535-0040 EVEN SO DID ULYSSES AND HIS MEN FALL UPON THE SUITORS AND SMITE THEM ON EVERY SIDE THEY MADE A HORRIBLE GROANING AS THEIR BRAINS WERE BEING BATTERED IN AND THE GROUND SEETHED WITH THEIR BLOOD
255-121535-0041 THEN CAUGHT THE KNEES OF ULYSSES AND SAID ULYSSES I BESEECH YOU HAVE MERCY UPON ME AND SPARE ME
255-121535-0042 EITHER IN WORD OR DEED AND I TRIED TO STOP THE OTHERS I SAW THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN AND NOW THEY ARE PAYING FOR THEIR FOLLY I WAS THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST IF YOU KILL ME
255-121535-0043 I SHALL DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT AND SHALL HAVE GOT NO THANKS FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT I DID ULYSSES LOOKED STERNLY AT HIM AND ANSWERED IF YOU WERE THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST YOU MUST HAVE PRAYED MANY A TIME
255-121535-0044 ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK SO THAT HIS HEAD FELL ROLLING IN THE DUST WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING
255-121535-0045 DO NOT THEREFORE BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO CUT MY HEAD OFF YOUR OWN SON TELEMACHUS WILL TELL YOU THAT I DID NOT WANT TO FREQUENT YOUR HOUSE AND SING TO THE SUITORS AFTER THEIR MEALS BUT THEY WERE TOO MANY AND TOO STRONG FOR ME
255-121535-0046 SO THEY MADE ME TELEMACHUS HEARD HIM
255-121535-0047 HOLD HE CRIED THE MAN IS GUILTLESS DO HIM NO HURT AND WE WILL SPARE MEDON TOO WHO WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO ME WHEN I WAS A BOY UNLESS
255-121535-0048 OR EUMAEUS HAS ALREADY KILLED HIM OR HE HAS FALLEN IN YOUR WAY WHEN YOU WERE RAGING ABOUT THE COURT MEDON CAUGHT THESE WORDS OF TELEMACHUS FOR HE WAS CROUCHING UNDER A SEAT
255-121535-0049 BENEATH WHICH HE HAD HIDDEN BY COVERING HIMSELF UP WITH A FRESHLY FLAYED HEIFER'S HIDE SO HE THREW OFF THE HIDE WENT UP TO TELEMACHUS AND LAID HOLD OF HIS KNEES HERE I AM MY DEAR SIR SAID HE
255-121535-0050 STAY YOUR HAND THEREFORE AND TELL YOUR FATHER OR HE WILL KILL ME IN HIS RAGE AGAINST THE SUITORS FOR HAVING WASTED HIS SUBSTANCE AND BEEN SO FOOLISHLY DISRESPECTFUL TO YOURSELF ULYSSES SMILED AT HIM AND ANSWERED
255-121535-0051 LOOKING FEARFULLY ROUND AND STILL EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD BE KILLED THEN ULYSSES SEARCHED THE WHOLE COURT CAREFULLY OVER TO SEE IF ANYONE HAD MANAGED TO HIDE HIMSELF AND WAS STILL LIVING
255-121535-0052 BUT HE FOUND THEM ALL LYING IN THE DUST AND WELTERING IN THEIR BLOOD THEY WERE LIKE FISHES WHICH FISHERMEN HAVE NETTED OUT OF THE SEA AND THROWN UPON THE BEACH TO LIE GASPING FOR WATER
255-121535-0053 TILL THE HEAT OF THE SUN MAKES AN END OF THEM EVEN SO WERE THE SUITORS LYING ALL HUDDLED UP ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THEN ULYSSES SAID TO TELEMACHUS
255-121535-0054 FOLLOWING TELEMACHUS SHE FOUND ULYSSES AMONG THE CORPSES BESPATTERED WITH BLOOD AND FILTH LIKE A LION THAT HAS JUST BEEN DEVOURING AN OX AND HIS BREAST AND BOTH HIS CHEEKS ARE ALL BLOODY
255-121535-0055 FOR SHE SAW THAT A GREAT DEED HAD BEEN DONE BUT ULYSSES CHECKED HER OLD WOMAN SAID HE REJOICE IN SILENCE RESTRAIN YOURSELF AND DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT IT IS AN UNHOLY THING
255-121535-0056 THEY SHOWED NO DISRESPECT TO TELEMACHUS FOR HE HAS ONLY LATELY GROWN AND HIS MOTHER NEVER PERMITTED HIM TO GIVE ORDERS TO THE FEMALE SERVANTS BUT LET ME GO UPSTAIRS AND TELL YOUR WIFE ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED
255-121535-0057 FOR SOME GOD HAS BEEN SENDING HER TO SLEEP DO NOT WAKE HER YET ANSWERED ULYSSES BUT TELL THE WOMEN WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES TO COME TO ME
255-121535-0058 TO TELL THE WOMEN AND MAKE THEM COME TO ULYSSES IN THE MEANTIME HE CALLED TELEMACHUS THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD BEGIN SAID HE TO REMOVE THE DEAD AND MAKE THE WOMEN HELP YOU THEN
255-121535-0059 GET SPONGES AND CLEAN WATER TO SWILL DOWN THE TABLES AND SEATS WHEN YOU HAVE THOROUGHLY CLEANSED THE WHOLE CLOISTERS TAKE THE WOMEN INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE DOMED ROOM AND THE WALL OF THE OUTER COURT AND RUN THEM THROUGH WITH YOUR SWORDS
255-121535-0060 TILL THEY ARE QUITE DEAD AND HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT LOVE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY USED TO LIE IN SECRET WITH THE SUITORS ON THIS THE WOMEN CAME DOWN IN A BODY WEEPING AND WAILING BITTERLY FIRST
255-121535-0061 THEY CARRIED THE DEAD BODIES OUT AND PROPPED THEM UP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE GATEHOUSE ULYSSES ORDERED THEM ABOUT AND MADE THEM DO THEIR WORK QUICKLY SO THEY HAD TO CARRY THE BODIES OUT
255-121535-0062 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY CLEANED ALL THE TABLES AND SEATS WITH SPONGES AND WATER WHILE TELEMACHUS AND THE TWO OTHERS SHOVELLED UP THE BLOOD AND DIRT FROM THE GROUND AND THE WOMEN CARRIED IT ALL AWAY
255-121535-0063 AND PUT IT OUT OF DOORS THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE WHOLE PLACE QUITE CLEAN AND ORDERLY
255-121535-0064 IN THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL OF THE DOMED ROOM AND THAT OF THE YARD SO THAT THEY COULD NOT GET AWAY AND TELEMACHUS SAID TO THE OTHER TWO I SHALL NOT LET THESE WOMEN DIE A CLEAN DEATH
255-121535-0065 THEY WASHED THEIR HANDS AND FEET AND WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE FOR ALL WAS NOW OVER
255-121535-0066 BRING ME SULPHUR WHICH CLEANSES ALL POLLUTION AND FETCH FIRE ALSO THAT I MAY BURN IT AND PURIFY THE CLOISTERS GO MOREOVER AND TELL PENELOPE TO COME HERE WITH HER ATTENDANTS
255-121535-0067 AND ALSO ALL THE MAIDSERVANTS THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID IS TRUE
255-121535-0068 AS HE HAD BIDDEN HER AND ULYSSES THOROUGHLY PURIFIED THE CLOISTERS AND BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER COURTS THEN SHE WENT INSIDE TO CALL THE WOMEN AND TELL THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEREON THEY CAME FROM THEIR APARTMENT
