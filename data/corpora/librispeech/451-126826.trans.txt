451-126826-0015 I'M NOT GOING TO EAT A SINGLE THING ALL DAY EXCEPT BREAD AND WATER AND NOT MUCH OF THAT
451-126826-0016 TO SIT DOWN TO ONE OF AUNT JANET'S MEALS IN ORDINARY HEALTH AND APPETITE AND EAT NOTHING BUT BREAD AND WATER THAT WOULD BE PENANCE WITH A VENGEANCE WE FELT WE COULD NEVER DO IT BUT THE STORY GIRL DID IT WE ADMIRED AND PITIED HER
451-126826-0017 HER ASCETIC FARE WAS REALLY SWEETER TO HER THAN HONEY OF HYMETTUS SHE WAS THOUGH QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY ACTING A PART AND TASTING ALL THE SUBTLE JOY OF THE ARTIST WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE EXQUISITE THAN ANY MATERIAL PLEASURE
451-126826-0018 AUNT JANET OF COURSE NOTICED THE STORY GIRL'S ABSTINENCE AND ASKED IF SHE WAS SICK NO
451-126826-0019 FOR A SIN I COMMITTED I CAN'T CONFESS IT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BRING TROUBLE ON ANOTHER PERSON SO I'M GOING TO DO PENANCE ALL DAY YOU DON'T MIND DO YOU AUNT JANET WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOUR THAT MORNING SO SHE MERELY LAUGHED
451-126826-0020 NOT IF YOU DON'T GO TOO FAR WITH YOUR NONSENSE SHE SAID TOLERANTLY THANK YOU

451-126826-0023 YOU'LL DO NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID AUNT JANET SARA MUST NOT DO PENANCE IN THAT WAY SHE WOULD WEAR HOLES IN HER STOCKINGS AND MIGHT SERIOUSLY BRUISE HER FEET WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOOK A WHIP AND WHIPPED MY BARE SHOULDERS TILL THE BLOOD CAME
451-126826-0024 DEMANDED THE STORY GIRL AGGRIEVED I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING RETORTED AUNT JANET
451-126826-0025 YOU'D FIND THAT PENANCE ENOUGH THE STORY GIRL WAS CRIMSON WITH INDIGNATION TO HAVE SUCH A REMARK MADE TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE FOURTEEN AND A HALF AND BEFORE THE BOYS TOO REALLY AUNT JANET COULD BE VERY DREADFUL
451-126826-0026 IT WAS VACATION AND THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO DO THAT DAY WE WERE SOON FREE TO SEEK THE ORCHARD BUT THE STORY GIRL WOULD NOT COME SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF IN THE DARKEST HOTTEST CORNER OF THE KITCHEN WITH A PIECE OF OLD COTTON IN HER HAND
451-126826-0027 I AM NOT GOING TO PLAY TO DAY SHE SAID AND I'M NOT GOING TO TELL A SINGLE STORY AUNT JANET WON'T LET ME PUT PEBBLES IN MY SHOES
451-126826-0028 IF I LEAN BACK THE LEAST BIT AND I'M GOING TO WORK BUTTONHOLES ALL OVER THIS COTTON I HATE WORKING BUTTONHOLES WORSE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD SO I'M GOING TO WORK THEM ALL DAY WHAT'S THE GOOD OF WORKING BUTTONHOLES ON AN OLD RAG ASKED FELICITY IT ISN'T ANY GOOD
451-126826-0029 THE BEAUTY OF PENANCE IS THAT IT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DO WHETHER IT'S USEFUL OR NOT SO LONG AS IT'S NASTY OH I WONDER HOW SARA IS THIS MORNING MOTHER'S GOING DOWN THIS AFTERNOON SAID FELICITY
451-126826-0030 SHE SAYS NONE OF US MUST GO NEAR THE PLACE TILL WE KNOW WHETHER IT IS THE MEASLES OR NOT I'VE THOUGHT OF A GREAT PENANCE SAID CECILY EAGERLY DON'T GO TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING TO NIGHT THE STORY GIRL LOOKED PITEOUS
451-126826-0031 I MUST HEAR THAT MISSIONARY SPEAK
451-126826-0032 JUST THINK HOW MANY NEW STORIES I'D HAVE TO TELL AFTER I'D HEARD HIM NO I MUST GO BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO I'LL WEAR MY SCHOOL DRESS AND HAT THAT WILL BE PENANCE FELICITY WHEN YOU SET THE TABLE FOR DINNER PUT THE BROKEN HANDLED KNIFE FOR ME I HATE IT SO
451-126826-0033 AND I'M GOING TO TAKE A DOSE OF MEXICAN TEA EVERY TWO HOURS IT'S SUCH DREADFUL TASTING STUFF BUT IT'S A GOOD BLOOD PURIFIER SO AUNT JANET CAN'T OBJECT TO IT THE STORY GIRL CARRIED OUT HER SELF IMPOSED PENANCE FULLY
451-126826-0034 ALL DAY SHE SAT IN THE KITCHEN AND WORKED BUTTONHOLES SUBSISTING ON BREAD AND WATER AND MEXICAN TEA FELICITY DID A MEAN THING SHE WENT TO WORK AND MADE LITTLE RAISIN PIES RIGHT THERE IN THE KITCHEN BEFORE THE STORY GIRL
451-126826-0035 THE SMELL OF RAISIN PIES IS SOMETHING TO TEMPT AN ANCHORITE AND THE STORY GIRL WAS EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF THEM FELICITY ATE TWO IN HER VERY PRESENCE AND THEN BROUGHT THE REST OUT TO US IN THE ORCHARD THE STORY GIRL COULD SEE US THROUGH THE WINDOW
451-126826-0036 CAROUSING WITHOUT STINT ON RAISIN PIES AND UNCLE EDWARD'S CHERRIES BUT SHE WORKED ON AT HER BUTTONHOLES SHE WOULD NOT LOOK AT THE EXCITING SERIAL IN THE NEW MAGAZINE DAN BROUGHT HOME FROM THE POST OFFICE NEITHER WOULD SHE OPEN A LETTER FROM HER FATHER
451-126826-0037 PAT CAME OVER BUT HIS MOST SEDUCTIVE PURRS WON NO NOTICE FROM HIS MISTRESS WHO REFUSED HERSELF THE PLEASURE OF EVEN PATTING HIM AUNT JANET COULD NOT GO DOWN THE HILL IN THE AFTERNOON TO FIND OUT HOW SARA WAS BECAUSE COMPANY CAME TO TEA
451-126826-0038 THE MILLWARDS FROM MARKDALE MISTER MILLWARD WAS A DOCTOR AND MISSUS MILLWARD WAS A B A AUNT JANET WAS VERY DESIROUS THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE AS NICE AS POSSIBLE AND WE WERE ALL SENT TO OUR ROOMS BEFORE TEA TO WASH AND DRESS UP THE STORY GIRL SLIPPED OVER HOME
451-126826-0039 AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK WE GASPED SHE HAD COMBED HER HAIR OUT STRAIGHT AND BRAIDED IT IN A TIGHT KINKY PUDGY BRAID AND SHE WORE AN OLD DRESS OF FADED PRINT WITH HOLES IN THE ELBOWS AND RAGGED FLOUNCES WHICH WAS MUCH TOO SHORT FOR HER SARA STANLEY
451-126826-0040 DON'T YOU KNOW I HAVE COMPANY TO TEA
451-126826-0041 I WANT TO MORTIFY THE FLESH I'LL MORTIFY YOU IF I CATCH YOU SHOWING YOURSELF TO THE MILLWARDS LIKE THAT MY GIRL GO RIGHT HOME AND DRESS YOURSELF DECENTLY OR EAT YOUR SUPPER IN THE KITCHEN THE STORY GIRL CHOSE THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE
451-126826-0042 AND EATING ONLY BREAD AND WATER BEFORE THE CRITICAL MILLWARDS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVE BLISS TO HER WHEN WE WENT TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING THAT EVENING
451-126826-0043 WHILE FELICITY AND CECILY WERE IN THEIR PRETTY MUSLINS AND SHE HAD TIED HER HAIR WITH A SNUFF BROWN RIBBON WHICH WAS VERY UNBECOMING TO HER THE FIRST PERSON WE SAW IN THE CHURCH PORCH WAS MISSUS RAY
451-126826-0044 SHE TOLD US THAT SARA HAD NOTHING WORSE THAN A FEVERISH COLD THE MISSIONARY HAD AT LEAST SEVEN HAPPY LISTENERS THAT NIGHT
451-126826-0045 NOW YOU SEE ALL YOUR PENANCE WAS WASTED SAID FELICITY AS WE WALKED HOME KEEPING CLOSE TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE RUMOUR THAT PEG BOWEN WAS ABROAD OH I DON'T KNOW I FEEL BETTER SINCE I PUNISHED MYSELF
451-126826-0046 BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE UP FOR IT TO MORROW SAID THE STORY GIRL ENERGETICALLY IN FACT I'LL BEGIN TO NIGHT I'M GOING TO THE PANTRY AS SOON AS I GET HOME AND I'LL READ FATHER'S LETTER BEFORE I GO TO BED WASN'T THE MISSIONARY SPLENDID THAT CANNIBAL STORY WAS SIMPLY GRAND
451-126826-0047 MISSIONARIES ARE SUCH NOBLE PEOPLE I'D LIKE TO BE A MISSIONARY AND HAVE ADVENTURES LIKE THAT SAID FELIX IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT IF YOU COULD BE SURE THE CANNIBALS WOULD BE INTERRUPTED IN THE NICK OF TIME AS HIS WERE SAID DAN BUT SPOSEN THEY WEREN'T
451-126826-0048 I'M GOING TO PUT TWO CENTS MORE A WEEK IN MY MISSIONARY BOX THAN I'VE BEEN DOING SAID CECILY DETERMINEDLY TWO CENTS MORE A WEEK OUT OF CECILY'S EGG MONEY MEANT SOMETHING OF A SACRIFICE IT INSPIRED THE REST OF US
451-126826-0049 WE ALL DECIDED TO INCREASE OUR WEEKLY CONTRIBUTION BY A CENT OR SO
451-126826-0050 DETERMINED TO START ONE I DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO FEEL AS INT'RESTED IN MISSIONARIES AS YOU FOLKS DO HE SAID BUT MAYBE IF I BEGIN TO GIVE SOMETHING I'LL GET INT'RESTED I'LL WANT TO KNOW HOW MY MONEY'S BEING SPENT I WON'T BE ABLE TO GIVE MUCH
451-126826-0051 WHEN YOUR FATHER'S RUN AWAY AND YOUR MOTHER GOES OUT WASHING AND YOU'RE ONLY OLD ENOUGH TO GET FIFTY CENTS A WEEK YOU CAN'T GIVE MUCH TO THE HEATHEN BUT I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN MY AUNT JANE WAS FOND OF MISSIONS
451-126826-0052 RATHER THAN TO PRESBYTERIAN HEATHEN NO IT'S ONLY AFTER THEY'RE CONVERTED THAT THEY'RE ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR SAID FELICITY BEFORE THAT THEY'RE JUST PLAIN HEATHEN BUT IF YOU WANT YOUR MONEY TO GO TO A METHODIST MISSIONARY
451-126826-0053 YOU CAN GIVE IT TO THE METHODIST MINISTER AT MARKDALE I GUESS THE PRESBYTERIANS CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT IT AND LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN HEATHEN JUST SMELL MISSUS SAMPSON'S FLOWERS SAID CECILY AS WE PASSED A TRIM WHITE PALING CLOSE TO THE ROAD
451-126826-0054 OVER WHICH BLEW ODOURS SWEETER THAN THE PERFUME OF ARABY'S SHORE HER ROSES ARE ALL OUT AND THAT BED OF SWEET WILLIAM IS A SIGHT BY DAYLIGHT
451-126826-0055 WILLIAM IS A MAN'S NAME AND MEN ARE NEVER SWEET
451-126826-0056 BUT THEY ARE NOT SWEET AND SHOULDN'T BE THAT IS FOR WOMEN OH LOOK AT THE MOONSHINE ON THE ROAD IN THAT GAP BETWEEN THE SPRUCES I'D LIKE A DRESS OF MOONSHINE WITH STARS FOR BUTTONS IT WOULDN'T DO SAID FELICITY DECIDEDLY YOU COULD SEE THROUGH IT
