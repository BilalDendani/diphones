6184-61313-0002 EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY TRACES SURVIVE IN EUROPE OF THE EARLY CULTURAL IMPRESS OF THE EAST OUR SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC FOR INSTANCE
6184-61313-0003 AS IN THE NILE VALLEY HOWEVER IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE IN MESOPOTAMIA THE INITIATORY STAGES OF PREHISTORIC CULTURE BASED ON THE AGRICULTURAL MODE OF LIFE
6184-61313-0004 WHAT IS GENERALLY CALLED THE DAWN OF HISTORY IS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF A LATER AGE OF PROGRESS IT IS NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DEGREE OF CIVILIZATION ATTAINED AT THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF WHICH WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE BY POSTULATING
6184-61313-0005 A REMOTER AGE OF CULTURE OF MUCH LONGER DURATION THAN THAT WHICH SEPARATES THE DAWN FROM THE AGE IN WHICH WE NOW LIVE
6184-61313-0006 WHICH JUSTIFY THE APPLICATION OF THE TERM INDIGENOUS IN THE BROAD SENSE IT IS FOUND LIKE THAT OF EGYPT TO BE POSSESSED OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS WHICH SUGGEST EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE INFLUENCES AND CONNECTIONS AT PRESENT OBSCURE
6184-61313-0007 OF SPECIAL INTEREST IN THIS REGARD IS PROFESSOR BUDGE'S MATURE AND WELL DELIBERATED CONCLUSION
6184-61313-0008 BUT EXCEEDINGLY ANCIENT SOURCE
6184-61313-0009 AND THEY RESEMBLE CLOSELY IN TURN THOSE OF THE NEOLITHIC EUROPEANS THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF SUCH EVIDENCE FORCES US TO REGARD AS NOT WHOLLY SATISFACTORY AND CONCLUSIVE THE HYPOTHESIS OF CULTURAL INFLUENCE
6184-61313-0010 A REMOTE RACIAL CONNECTION IS POSSIBLE AND IS CERTAINLY WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION WHEN SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS PROFESSOR FRAZER AUTHOR OF THE GOLDEN BOUGH
6184-61313-0011 IS FOUND PREPARED TO ADMIT THAT THE WIDESPREAD HOMOGENEITY OF BELIEFS MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO HOMOGENEITY OF RACE IT IS SHOWN CHAPTER ONE THAT CERTAIN ETHNOLOGISTS HAVE ACCUMULATED DATA
6184-61313-0012 WHICH ESTABLISH A RACIAL KINSHIP BETWEEN THE NEOLITHIC EUROPEANS
6184-61313-0013 THROUGHOUT THIS VOLUME COMPARATIVE NOTES HAVE BEEN COMPILED IN DEALING WITH MESOPOTAMIAN BELIEFS
6184-61313-0014 INTERESTING PARALLELS HAVE BEEN GLEANED FROM VARIOUS RELIGIOUS LITERATURES IN EUROPE EGYPT INDIA AND ELSEWHERE IT WILL BE FOUND THAT CERTAIN RELICS OF BABYLONIAN INTELLECTUAL LIFE WHICH HAVE A DISTINCTIVE GEOGRAPHICAL SIGNIFICANCE
