8011-280922-0000 THE PEASANT MAREY IT WAS THE SECOND DAY IN EASTER WEEK THE AIR WAS WARM THE SKY WAS BLUE THE SUN WAS HIGH WARM BRIGHT BUT MY SOUL WAS VERY GLOOMY
8011-280922-0001 I SAUNTERED BEHIND THE PRISON BARRACKS I STARED AT THE PALINGS OF THE STOUT PRISON FENCE COUNTING THE MOVERS BUT I HAD NO INCLINATION TO COUNT THEM
8011-280922-0002 THIS WAS THE SECOND DAY OF THE HOLIDAYS IN THE PRISON THE CONVICTS WERE NOT TAKEN OUT TO WORK THERE WERE NUMBERS OF MEN DRUNK LOUD ABUSE AND QUARRELLING WAS SPRINGING UP CONTINUALLY IN EVERY CORNER THERE WERE HIDEOUS DISGUSTING SONGS
8011-280922-0003 AND CARD PARTIES INSTALLED BESIDE THE PLATFORM BEDS
8011-280922-0004 FOR SPECIAL VIOLENCE TO BE BEATEN TILL THEY WERE HALF DEAD WERE LYING ON THE PLATFORM BED COVERED WITH SHEEPSKINS TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER AND COME TO THEMSELVES AGAIN KNIVES HAD ALREADY BEEN DRAWN SEVERAL TIMES FOR THESE TWO DAYS OF HOLIDAY
8011-280922-0005 ALL THIS HAD BEEN TORTURING ME TILL IT MADE ME ILL AND INDEED I COULD NEVER ENDURE WITHOUT REPULSION THE NOISE AND DISORDER OF DRUNKEN PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS PLACE ON THESE DAYS EVEN THE PRISON OFFICIALS DID NOT LOOK INTO THE PRISON MADE NO SEARCHES
8011-280922-0006 DID NOT LOOK FOR VODKA UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY MUST ALLOW EVEN THESE OUTCASTS TO ENJOY THEMSELVES ONCE A YEAR AND THAT THINGS WOULD BE EVEN WORSE IF THEY DID NOT AT LAST A SUDDEN FURY FLAMED UP IN MY HEART A POLITICAL PRISONER CALLED M MET ME
8011-280922-0007 HE LOOKED AT ME GLOOMILY HIS EYES FLASHED AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED
8011-280922-0008 HE HISSED TO ME THROUGH HIS TEETH AND WALKED ON I RETURNED TO THE PRISON WARD THOUGH ONLY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE I HAD RUSHED OUT OF IT AS THOUGH I WERE CRAZY WHEN SIX STALWART FELLOWS HAD ALL TOGETHER FLUNG THEMSELVES UPON THE DRUNKEN
8011-280922-0009 ALMOST WITHOUT SIGN OF LIFE HE LAY COVERED WITH A SHEEPSKIN AND EVERY ONE WALKED ROUND HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING THOUGH THEY CONFIDENTLY HOPED THAT HE WOULD COME TO HIMSELF NEXT MORNING YET IF LUCK WAS AGAINST HIM MAYBE FROM A BEATING LIKE THAT THE MAN WOULD DIE
8011-280922-0010 I LIKED TO LIE LIKE THAT A SLEEPING MAN IS NOT MOLESTED AND MEANWHILE ONE CAN DREAM AND THINK BUT I COULD NOT DREAM MY HEART WAS BEATING UNEASILY
8011-280922-0011 WERE ECHOING IN MY EARS BUT WHY DESCRIBE MY IMPRESSIONS I SOMETIMES DREAM EVEN NOW OF THOSE TIMES AT NIGHT AND I HAVE NO DREAMS MORE AGONISING PERHAPS IT WILL BE NOTICED THAT EVEN TO THIS DAY
8011-280922-0012 I HAVE SCARCELY ONCE SPOKEN IN PRINT OF MY LIFE IN PRISON THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD I WROTE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IN THE CHARACTER OF AN IMAGINARY PERSON
8011-280922-0013 I MAY ADD BY THE WAY THAT SINCE THEN VERY MANY PERSONS HAVE SUPPOSED AND EVEN NOW MAINTAIN THAT I WAS SENT TO PENAL SERVITUDE FOR THE MURDER OF MY WIFE GRADUALLY I SANK INTO FORGETFULNESS AND BY DEGREES WAS LOST IN MEMORIES
8011-280922-0014 THESE MEMORIES ROSE UP OF THEMSELVES IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT OF MY OWN WILL I SUMMONED THEM
8011-280922-0015 SOME LITTLE THING AT TIMES UNNOTICED AND THEN BY DEGREES THERE WOULD RISE UP A COMPLETE PICTURE SOME VIVID AND COMPLETE IMPRESSION
8011-280922-0016 GIVE NEW FEATURES TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED LONG AGO AND BEST OF ALL I USED TO CORRECT IT CORRECT IT CONTINUALLY THAT WAS MY GREAT AMUSEMENT ON THIS OCCASION I SUDDENLY FOR SOME REASON REMEMBERED
8011-280922-0017 I REMEMBERED THE MONTH OF AUGUST IN OUR COUNTRY HOUSE A DRY BRIGHT DAY BUT RATHER COLD AND WINDY SUMMER WAS WANING AND SOON WE SHOULD HAVE TO GO TO MOSCOW TO BE BORED ALL THE WINTER OVER FRENCH LESSONS AND I WAS SO SORRY TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY
8011-280922-0018 I WALKED PAST THE THRESHING FLOOR AND GOING DOWN THE RAVINE I WENT UP TO THE DENSE THICKET OF BUSHES THAT COVERED THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE RAVINE AS FAR AS THE COPSE AND I PLUNGED RIGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THE BUSHES AND HEARD A PEASANT PLOUGHING ALONE ON THE CLEARING
8011-280922-0019 AND THE HORSE WAS MOVING WITH EFFORT AND FROM TIME TO TIME THE PEASANT'S CALL COME UP FLOATED UPWARDS TO ME I KNEW ALMOST ALL OUR PEASANTS BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHICH IT WAS PLOUGHING NOW AND I DID NOT CARE WHO IT WAS I WAS ABSORBED IN MY OWN AFFAIRS
8011-280922-0020 I WAS VERY FOND TOO OF THE LITTLE NIMBLE RED AND YELLOW LIZARDS WITH BLACK SPOTS ON THEM BUT I WAS AFRAID OF SNAKES SNAKES HOWEVER WERE MUCH MORE RARE THAN LIZARDS THERE WERE NOT MANY MUSHROOMS THERE TO GET MUSHROOMS ONE HAD TO GO TO THE BIRCH WOOD
8011-280922-0021 IT WAS OUR PEASANT MAREY I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS SUCH A NAME BUT EVERY ONE CALLED HIM MAREY A THICK SET RATHER WELL GROWN PEASANT OF FIFTY WITH A GOOD MANY GREY HAIRS IN HIS DARK BROWN SPREADING BEARD I KNEW HIM
8011-280922-0022 AND WHEN BREATHLESS I CAUGHT WITH ONE HAND AT HIS PLOUGH AND WITH THE OTHER AT HIS SLEEVE HE SAW HOW FRIGHTENED I WAS THERE IS A WOLF I CRIED PANTING HE FLUNG UP HIS HEAD AND COULD NOT HELP LOOKING ROUND FOR AN INSTANT ALMOST BELIEVING ME
8011-280922-0023 WHERE IS THE WOLF A SHOUT SOME ONE SHOUTED WOLF I FALTERED OUT NONSENSE NONSENSE A WOLF WHY IT WAS YOUR FANCY HOW COULD THERE BE A WOLF HE MUTTERED REASSURING ME BUT I WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER AND STILL KEPT TIGHT HOLD OF HIS SMOCK FROCK
8011-280922-0024 COME COME THERE CHRIST BE WITH YOU CROSS YOURSELF BUT I DID NOT CROSS MYSELF THE CORNERS OF MY MOUTH WERE TWITCHING AND I THINK THAT STRUCK HIM PARTICULARLY HE PUT OUT HIS THICK BLACK NAILED EARTH STAINED FINGER AND SOFTLY TOUCHED MY TWITCHING LIPS AIE
8011-280922-0025 THERE THERE HE SAID TO ME WITH A SLOW ALMOST MOTHERLY SMILE DEAR DEAR WHAT IS THE MATTER THERE COME COME I GRASPED AT LAST THAT THERE WAS NO WOLF
8011-280922-0026 YET THAT SHOUT HAD BEEN SO CLEAR AND DISTINCT BUT SUCH SHOUTS NOT ONLY ABOUT WOLVES I HAD IMAGINED ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE AND I WAS AWARE OF THAT THESE HALLUCINATIONS PASSED AWAY LATER AS I GREW OLDER WELL I WILL GO THEN I SAID
8011-280922-0027 LOOKING AT HIM TIMIDLY AND INQUIRINGLY WELL DO AND I'LL KEEP WATCH ON YOU AS YOU GO I WON'T LET THE WOLF GET AT YOU
8011-280922-0028 VOLTCHOK FLEW TO MEET ME WITH VOLTCHOK I FELT QUITE SAFE AND I TURNED ROUND TO MAREY FOR THE LAST TIME I COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE DISTINCTLY BUT I FELT THAT HE WAS STILL NODDING AND SMILING AFFECTIONATELY TO ME I WAVED TO HIM HE WAVED BACK TO ME
8011-280922-0029 I SUDDENLY ROUSED MYSELF AND SAT UP ON THE PLATFORM BED AND I REMEMBER FOUND MYSELF STILL SMILING QUIETLY AT MY MEMORIES I BROODED OVER THEM FOR ANOTHER MINUTE WHEN I GOT HOME THAT DAY I TOLD NO ONE OF MY ADVENTURE WITH MAREY AND INDEED IT WAS HARDLY AN ADVENTURE AND
8011-280922-0030 IN FACT I SOON FORGOT MAREY WHEN I MET HIM NOW AND THEN AFTERWARDS I NEVER EVEN SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THE WOLF OR ANYTHING ELSE AND ALL AT ONCE NOW TWENTY YEARS AFTERWARDS IN SIBERIA I REMEMBERED THIS MEETING WITH SUCH DISTINCTNESS TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL
8011-280922-0031 THOUGH I KNEW NOTHING OF IT AND ROSE SUDDENLY TO MY MEMORY WHEN IT WAS WANTED
