8245-274392-0000 EVERY MAN HAD FRAMED THE MODEL OF A REPUBLIC AND HOWEVER NEW IT WAS OR FANTASTICAL HE WAS EAGER IN RECOMMENDING IT TO HIS FELLOW CITIZENS OR EVEN IMPOSING IT BY FORCE UPON THEM
8245-274392-0001 EVERY MAN HAD ADJUSTED A SYSTEM OF RELIGION WHICH BEING DERIVED FROM NO TRADITIONAL AUTHORITY WAS PECULIAR TO HIMSELF
8245-274392-0002 AND ITS PROFESSORS AND ON PRETENCE OF RENDERING MORE SIMPLE THE DISTRIBUTION OF JUSTICE WERE DESIROUS OF ABOLISHING THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF ENGLISH JURISPRUDENCE
8245-274392-0003 EVEN THOSE AMONG THE REPUBLICANS WHO ADOPTED NOT SUCH EXTRAVAGANCIES WERE SO INTOXICATED WITH THEIR SAINTLY CHARACTER THAT THEY SUPPOSED THEMSELVES POSSESSED OF PECULIAR PRIVILEGES AND ALL PROFESSIONS OATHS
8245-274392-0004 HAD IN A GREAT MEASURE LOST THEIR INFLUENCE OVER THEM THE BANDS OF SOCIETY WERE EVERY WHERE LOOSENED AND THE IRREGULAR PASSIONS OF MEN WERE ENCOURAGED BY SPECULATIVE PRINCIPLES STILL MORE UNSOCIAL AND IRREGULAR
8245-274392-0005 THE ROYALISTS CONSISTING OF THE NOBLES AND MORE CONSIDERABLE GENTRY BEING DEGRADED FROM THEIR AUTHORITY AND PLUNDERED OF THEIR PROPERTY WERE INFLAMED WITH THE HIGHEST RESENTMENT AND INDIGNATION
8245-274392-0006 AGAINST THOSE IGNOBLE ADVERSARIES WHO HAD REDUCED THEM TO SUBJECTION
8245-274392-0007 WERE ENRAGED TO FIND THAT BY THE TREACHERY OR SUPERIOR CUNNING OF THEN ASSOCIATES THE FRUITS OF ALL THEIR SUCCESSFUL LABORS WERE RAVISHED FROM THEM THE FORMER PARTY FROM INCLINATION AND PRINCIPLE
8245-274392-0008 WHOSE MEMORY THEY RESPECTED AND WHOSE TRAGICAL DEATH THEY DEPLORED
8245-274392-0009 MANY FEARS AND JEALOUSIES TO BE ALLAYED ERE THEY COULD CORDIALLY ENTERTAIN THOUGHTS OF RESTORING THE FAMILY WHICH THEY HAD SO GRIEVOUSLY OFFENDED AND WHOSE PRINCIPLES THEY REGARDED WITH SUCH VIOLENT ABHORRENCE
8245-274392-0010 THE ONLY SOLID SUPPORT OF THE REPUBLICAN INDEPENDENT FACTION WHICH THOUGH IT FORMED SO SMALL A PART OF THE NATION HAD VIOLENTLY USURPED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WHOLE WAS A NUMEROUS ARMY OF NEAR FIFTY THOUSAND MEN BUT THIS ARMY
8245-274392-0011 FORMIDABLE FROM ITS DISCIPLINE AND COURAGE AS WELL AS ITS NUMBERS
8245-274392-0012 WHICH HAD ASSUMED THE COMMAND OVER IT ACCUSTOMED TO INDULGE EVERY CHIMERA IN POLITICS EVERY FRENZY IN RELIGION THE SOLDIERS KNEW LITTLE OF THE SUBORDINATION OF CITIZENS AND HAD ONLY LEARNED FROM APPARENT NECESSITY
8245-274392-0013 SOME MAXIMS OF MILITARY OBEDIENCE
8245-274392-0014 THEY WERE READY TO BREAK OUT INTO ANY NEW DISORDER WHEREVER THEY HAD THE PROSPECT OF A LIKE SANCTION AND AUTHORITY WHAT ALONE GAVE SOME STABILITY TO ALL THESE UNSETTLED HUMORS WAS THE GREAT INFLUENCE BOTH CIVIL AND MILITARY
8245-274392-0015 ACQUIRED BY OLIVER CROMWELL THIS MAN SUITED TO THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED AND TO THAT ALONE WAS EQUALLY QUALIFIED TO GAIN THE AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE OF MEN BY WHAT WAS MEAN VULGAR AND RIDICULOUS IN HIS CHARACTER
8245-274392-0016 AS TO COMMAND THEIR OBEDIENCE BY WHAT WAS GREAT DARING AND ENTERPRISING FAMILIAR EVEN TO BUFFOONERY WITH THE MEANEST SENTINEL HE NEVER LOST HIS AUTHORITY
8245-274392-0017 TRANSPORTED TO A DEGREE OF MADNESS WITH RELIGIOUS ECSTASIES HE NEVER FORGOT THE POLITICAL PURPOSES TO WHICH THEY MIGHT SERVE HATING MONARCHY WHILE A SUBJECT DESPISING LIBERTY WHILE A CITIZEN
8245-274392-0018 THOUGH HE RETAINED FOR A TIME ALL ORDERS OF MEN UNDER A SEEMING OBEDIENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT HE WAS SECRETLY PAVING THE WAY BY ARTIFICE AND COURAGE TO HIS OWN UNLIMITED AUTHORITY
8245-274392-0019 THE PARLIAMENT FOR SO WE MUST HENCEFORTH CALL A SMALL AND INCONSIDERABLE PART OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAVING MURDERED THEIR SOVEREIGN WITH SO MANY APPEARING CIRCUMSTANCES OF SOLEMNITY AND JUSTICE AND SO MUCH REAL VIOLENCE
8245-274392-0020 AND EVEN FURY BEGAN TO ASSUME MORE THE AIR OF A CIVIL LEGAL POWER AND TO ENLARGE A LITTLE THE NARROW BOTTOM UPON WHICH THEY STOOD THEY ADMITTED A FEW OF THE EXCLUDED AND ABSENT MEMBERS
8245-274392-0021 SUCH AS WERE LIABLE TO LEAST EXCEPTION BUT ON CONDITION THAT THESE MEMBERS SHOULD SIGN AN APPROBATION OF WHATEVER HAD BEEN DONE IN THEIR ABSENCE WITH REGARD TO THE KING'S TRIAL
8245-274392-0022 AND SOME OF THEM WERE WILLING TO ACQUIRE A SHARE OF POWER ON SUCH TERMS THE GREATER PART DISDAINED TO LEND THEIR AUTHORITY TO SUCH APPARENT USURPATIONS THEY ISSUED SOME WRITS FOR NEW ELECTIONS
8245-274392-0023 THEY NAMED A COUNCIL OF STATE THIRTY EIGHT IN NUMBER TO WHOM ALL ADDRESSES WERE MADE WHO GAVE ORDERS TO ALL GENERALS AND ADMIRALS WHO EXECUTED THE LAWS AND WHO DIGESTED
8245-274392-0024 POOR AND NEGLECTED LIVING SOMETIMES IN HOLLAND SOMETIMES IN FRANCE SOMETIMES IN JERSEY COMFORTED HIMSELF AMIDST HIS PRESENT DISTRESSES WITH THE HOPES OF BETTER FORTUNE
8245-274392-0025 THE SITUATION ALONE OF SCOTLAND AND IRELAND GAVE ANY IMMEDIATE INQUIETUDE TO THE NEW REPUBLIC AFTER THE SUCCESSIVE DEFEATS OF MONTROSE
8245-274392-0026 THE WHOLE AUTHORITY IN SCOTLAND
8245-274392-0027 THAT PARTY WHICH WAS MOST AVERSE TO THE INTERESTS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY THEIR ENMITY HOWEVER AGAINST THE INDEPENDENTS WHO HAD PREVENTED THE SETTLEMENT OF PRESBYTERIAN DISCIPLINE IN ENGLAND
8245-274392-0028 CARRIED THEM TO EMBRACE OPPOSITE MAXIMS IN THEIR POLITICAL CONDUCT THOUGH INVITED BY THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT TO MODEL THEIR GOVERNMENT INTO A REPUBLICAN FORM THEY RESOLVED STILL TO ADHERE TO MONARCHY WHICH HAD EVER PREVAILED IN THEIR COUNTRY
8245-274392-0029 AND WHICH BY THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THEIR COVENANT THEY HAD ENGAGED TO DEFEND THEY CONSIDERED BESIDES
8245-274392-0030 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH A COMMON WEALTH OR
8245-274392-0031 INVESTED WITH ROYAL AUTHORITY TO PRESERVE PEACE OR JUSTICE IN THE COMMUNITY THE EXECUTION THEREFORE OF THE KING AGAINST WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS PROTESTED HAVING OCCASIONED A VACANCY OF THE THRONE
8245-274392-0032 BUT UPON CONDITION OF HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE COVENANT AND HIS ENTERTAINING NO OTHER PERSONS ABOUT HIM BUT SUCH AS WERE GODLY MEN AND FAITHFUL TO THAT OBLIGATION
8245-274392-0033 THESE UNUSUAL CLAUSES INSERTED IN THE VERY FIRST ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR PRINCE SUFFICIENTLY SHOWED THEIR INTENTION OF LIMITING EXTREMELY HIS AUTHORITY
8245-274392-0034 ALLOWED THE SCOTS FOR THE PRESENT TO TAKE THEIR OWN MEASURES IN SETTLING THEIR GOVERNMENT THE DOMINION WHICH ENGLAND CLAIMED OVER IRELAND DEMANDED MORE IMMEDIATELY THEIR EFFORTS FOR SUBDUING THAT COUNTRY
8245-274392-0035 AND TO RELATE BRIEFLY THOSE TRANSACTIONS WHICH HAD PASSED DURING THE MEMORABLE REVOLUTIONS IN ENGLAND WHEN THE LATE KING AGREED TO THAT CESSATION OF ARMS WITH THE POPISH REBELS WHICH WAS BECOME SO REQUISITE
8245-274392-0036 AS WELL FOR THE SECURITY OF THE IRISH PROTESTANTS AS FOR PROMOTING HIS INTERESTS IN ENGLAND THE PARLIAMENT IN ORDER TO BLACKEN HIS CONDUCT REPROACHED HIM WITH FAVORING THAT ODIOUS REBELLION
8245-274392-0037 THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO DECLARE IT ENTIRELY NULL AND INVALID BECAUSE FINISHED WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND IN THIS DECLARATION THE SCOTS IN ULSTER AND THE EARL OF INCHIQUIN A NOBLEMAN OF GREAT AUTHORITY IN MUNSTER
8245-274392-0038 PROFESSED TO ADHERE BY THEIR MEANS THE WAR WAS STILL KEPT ALIVE BUT AS THE DANGEROUS DISTRACTIONS IN ENGLAND HINDERED THE PARLIAMENT FROM SENDING ANY CONSIDERABLE ASSISTANCE TO THEIR ALLIES IN IRELAND THE MARQUIS OF ORMOND LORD LIEUTENANT
8245-274392-0039 BEING A NATIVE OF IRELAND AND A PERSON ENDOWED WITH GREAT PRUDENCE AND VIRTUE FORMED A SCHEME FOR COMPOSING THE DISORDERS OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR ENGAGING THE REBEL IRISH TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE OF HIS ROYAL MASTER
8245-274392-0040 THERE WERE MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH STRONGLY INVITED THE NATIVES OF IRELAND TO EMBRACE THE KING'S PARTY
