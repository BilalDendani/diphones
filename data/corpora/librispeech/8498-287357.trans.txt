8498-287357-0009 BUT FIRST LET ME SUGGEST THAT WE MOVE FARTHER AWAY FROM THE HOUSE MY FATHER OR MISTER JACKSON OR THE HOUSEKEEPER MAY HEAR US TALKING AND IT MAY DISTURB THEM COME WITH ME TO MY PRIVATE SHOP AND TOM LED THE WAY TO A SMALL BUILDING WHERE HE DID EXPERIMENTAL WORK
8498-287357-0010 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR WITH A KEY HE CARRIED TURNED ON THE LIGHTS WHICH WERE RUN BY A STORAGE BATTERY AND MOTIONED MISTER JENKS TO A SEAT NOW I'LL HEAR YOUR STORY SAID TOM I'LL MAKE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE WENT ON THE QUEER MAN
8498-287357-0011 I WAS TOUCHED BY THE MAN'S APPEARANCE AND GAVE HIM SOME MONEY HE ASKED FOR MY CARD SAYING HE WOULD REPAY ME SOME DAY I GAVE IT TO HIM LITTLE THINKING I WOULD HEAR FROM THE MAN AGAIN BUT I DID
8498-287357-0012 HE CALLED AT MY APARTMENTS ABOUT A WEEK LATER SAYING HE HAD SECURED WORK AS AN EXPERT SETTER OF DIAMONDS AND WANTED TO REPAY ME I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE HIS MONEY BUT THE FACT THAT SUCH A SORRY LOOKING SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN I AIDED HIM WAS AN EXPERT HANDLER OF GEMS INTERESTED ME
8498-287357-0013 I TALKED WITH THE MAN AND HE MADE A CURIOUS STATEMENT THIS MAN WHO GAVE HIS NAME AS ENOS FOLWELL SAID HE KNEW A PLACE WHERE DIAMONDS COULD BE MADE PARTLY IN A SCIENTIFIC MANNER AND PARTLY BY THE FORCES OF NATURE
8498-287357-0014 I LAUGHED AT HIM BUT HE TOLD ME SO MANY DETAILS THAT I BEGAN TO BELIEVE HIM HE SAID HE AND SOME OTHER FRIENDS OF HIS WHO WERE DIAMOND CUTTERS HAD A PLANT IN THE MIDST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHERE THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING SEVERAL SMALL
8498-287357-0015 BUT VERY PERFECT DIAMONDS THEY HAD COME TO THE END OF THEIR ROPE THOUGH SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THE MATERIALS NEEDED FOLWELL SAID THAT HE AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD TEMPORARILY SEPARATED
8498-287357-0016 THEY HAD ALL AGREED TO GO OUT INTO CIVILIZATION AND WORK FOR ENOUGH FUNDS TO ENABLE THEM TO GO ON WITH THEIR DIAMOND MAKING I HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO BELIEVE THE MAN OR NOT BUT HE OFFERED PROOF HE HAD SEVERAL SMALL BUT VERY PERFECT DIAMONDS WITH HIM
8498-287357-0017 AND HE GAVE THEM TO ME TO HAVE TESTED IN ANY WAY I DESIRED I PROMISED TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER AND AS I WAS QUITE WEALTHY AS IN FACT I AM NOW AND IF I FOUND THAT THE STONES HE GAVE ME WERE REAL I SAID I MIGHT INVEST SOME MONEY IN THE PLANT WERE THE DIAMONDS GOOD
8498-287357-0018 ASKED TOM WHO WAS BEGINNING TO BE INTERESTED THEY WERE STONES OF THE FIRST WATER THOUGH SMALL AN EXPERT GEM MERCHANT TO WHOM I TOOK THEM SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY DIAMONDS LIKE THEM AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE I GOT THEM
8498-287357-0019 OF COURSE I DID NOT TELL HIM TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT I SAW FOLWELL AGAIN TOLD HIM TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND TO TELL THEM THAT I WOULD AGREE TO SUPPLY THE CASH NEEDED IF I COULD SHARE IN THE DIAMOND MAKING TO THIS THEY AGREED
8498-287357-0020 BUT THE EXACT LOCATION IS A MYSTERY THAT IS WHY I NEED YOUR HELP YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND THE REASON WELL AS I SAID MYSELF FOLWELL AND THE OTHERS WHO WERE NOT EXACTLY PREPOSSESSING SORT OF MEN STARTED WEST
8498-287357-0021 WHEN WE GOT TO A SMALL TOWN CALLED INDIAN RIDGE NEAR LEADVILLE COLORADO THE MEN INSISTED THAT I MUST NOW PROCEED IN SECRET AND CONSENT TO BE BLINDFOLDED AS THEY WERE NOT YET READY TO REVEAL THE SECRET OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY MADE THE DIAMONDS
8498-287357-0022 I DID NOT WANT TO AGREE TO THIS BUT THEY INSISTED AND I GAVE IN FOOLISHLY PERHAPS AT ANY RATE I WAS BLINDFOLDED ONE NIGHT PLACED IN A WAGON AND WE DROVE OFF INTO THE MOUNTAINS
8498-287357-0023 AFTER TRAVELING FOR SOME DISTANCE I WAS LED STILL BLINDFOLDED UP A STEEP TRAIL WHEN THE BANDAGE WAS TAKEN OFF MY EYES I SAW THAT I WAS IN A LARGE CAVE THE MEN WERE WITH ME AND THEY APOLOGIZED FOR THE NECESSITY THAT CAUSED THEM TO BLINDFOLD ME
8498-287357-0024 THEY SAID THEY WERE READY TO PROCEED WITH THE MAKING OF DIAMONDS BUT I MUST PROMISE NOT TO SEEK TO DISCOVER THE SECRET UNTIL THEY GAVE ME PERMISSION NOR WAS I TO ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE CAVE I HAD TO AGREE NEXT THEY DEMANDED THAT I GIVE THEM A LARGE SUM
8498-287357-0025 WHICH I HAD PROMISED WHEN THEY SHOWED ME CONCLUSIVELY THAT THEY COULD MAKE DIAMONDS I REFUSED TO DO THIS UNTIL I HAD SEEN SOME OF THE PRECIOUS STONES AND THEY AGREED THAT THIS WAS FAIR BUT SAID I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT A FEW DAYS WELL I WAITED
8498-287357-0026 I WAS TAKEN INTO A SMALL CHAMBER OF THE CAVE AND THERE SAW QUITE A COMPLICATED APPARATUS PART OF IT WAS A GREAT STEEL BOX WITH A LEVER ON IT WE WILL LET YOU MAKE SOME DIAMONDS FOR YOURSELF FOLWELL SAID TO ME
8498-287357-0027 AND HE DIRECTED ME TO PULL THE LEVER OF THE BOX AT A CERTAIN SIGNAL THE SIGNAL CAME JUST AS A TERRIFIC CRASH OF THUNDER SHOOK THE VERY MOUNTAIN INSIDE OF WHICH WE WERE THE BOX OF STEEL GOT RED HOT AND WHEN IT COOLED OFF IT WAS OPENED
8498-287357-0028 AND WAS GIVEN A HANDFUL OF WHITE STONES WERE THEY DIAMONDS ASKED TOM EAGERLY MISTER JENKS HELD OUT ONE HAND IN THE PALM GLITTERED A LARGE STONE OSTENSIBLY A DIAMOND
8498-287357-0029 IN THE RAYS OF THE MOON IT SHOWED ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW A BEAUTIFUL GEM THAT IS ONE OF THE STONES I MADE OR RATHER THAT I SUPPOSED I HAD MADE WENT ON MISTER JENKS IT IS ONE OF SEVERAL I HAVE
8498-287357-0030 THAT WAS MY UNDOING HOW AS SOON AS THE MEN GOT THE CASH THEY HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR ME THE NEXT I REMEMBER IS EATING A RUDE MEAL WHILE WE DISCUSSED THE FUTURE OF MAKING DIAMONDS
8498-287357-0031 I KNEW NOTHING MORE UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF BACK IN THE SMALL HOTEL AT INDIAN RIDGE WHENCE I HAD GONE SOME TIME PREVIOUS WITH THE MEN TO THE CAVE IN THE MOUNTAIN WHAT HAPPENED ASKED TOM MUCH SURPRISED BY THE UNEXPECTED OUTCOME OF THE AFFAIR
8498-287357-0032 I HAD BEEN TRICKED THAT WAS ALL AS SOON AS THE MEN HAD MY MONEY THEY HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR ME THEY DID NOT WANT ME TO LEARN THE SECRET OF THEIR DIAMOND MAKING AND THEY DRUGGED ME CARRIED ME AWAY FROM THE CAVE AND LEFT ME IN THE HOTEL DIDN'T YOU TRY TO FIND THE CAVE AGAIN
8498-287357-0033 I DID BUT WITHOUT AVAIL I SPENT SOME TIME IN THE ROCKIES BUT NO ONE COULD TELL WHERE PHANTOM MOUNTAIN WAS IN FACT FEW HAD HEARD OF IT AND I WAS NEARLY LOST SEARCHING FOR IT I CAME BACK EAST DETERMINED TO GET EVEN
8498-287357-0034 I HAD GIVEN THE MEN A VERY LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND IN EXCHANGE THEY HAD GIVEN ME SEVERAL DIAMONDS PROBABLY THE STONES ARE WORTH NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE MONEY I INVESTED BUT I WAS CHEATED FOR I WAS PROMISED AN EQUAL SHARE IN THE PROFITS THESE WERE DENIED ME
8498-287357-0035 AND I WAS TRICKED I DETERMINED TO BE REVENGED OR AT LEAST TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF MAKING DIAMONDS IT IS MY RIGHT I AGREE WITH YOU SPOKE TOM
8498-287357-0036 BUT UP TO THE TIME I MET YOU ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND I COULD FORM NO PLAN FOR DISCOVERING PHANTOM MOUNTAIN AND LEARNING THE SECRET OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS WENT ON MISTER JENKS
8498-287357-0037 AS YOU DOUBTLESS SAW WHEN WE WERE ON THE ISLAND BUT I KNEW I NEEDED AN AIRSHIP IN WHICH TO FLY OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND PICK OUT THE LOCATION OF THE CAVE WHERE THE DIAMONDS ARE MADE BUT HOW CAN YOU LOCATE IT IF YOU WERE BLINDFOLDED WHEN YOU WERE TAKEN THERE MISTER JENKS
8498-287357-0038 I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT ON OUR JOURNEY INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND JUST BEFORE I WAS CARRIED INTO THE CAVE I MANAGED TO RAISE ONE CORNER OF THE BANDAGE I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A VERY PECULIARLY SHAPED CLIFF IT IS LIKE A GREAT HEAD
8498-287357-0039 STANDING OUT IN BOLD RELIEF AGAINST THE MOONLIGHT WHEN I SAW IT THAT HEAD OF ROCK IS NEAR THE CAVE IT MAY BE THE LANDMARK BY WHICH WE CAN LOCATE PHANTOM MOUNTAIN PERHAPS ADMITTED THE YOUNG INVENTOR WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS THIS
8498-287357-0040 WENT ON MISTER JENKS WILL YOU GO WITH ME ON THIS QUEST GO IN YOUR AIRSHIP TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS IF YOU WILL I WILL SHARE WITH YOU WHATEVER DIAMONDS WE CAN DISCOVER OR MAKE BESIDES PAYING ALL EXPENSES
8498-287357-0041 WILL YOU GO TOM SWIFT THE YOUNG INVENTOR DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER HOW FAR WAS MISTER JENKS TO BE TRUSTED WERE THE STONES HE HAD REAL DIAMONDS WAS HIS STORY FANTASTICAL AS IT SOUNDED TRUE
8498-287357-0042 I INTENDED IT FOR YOU ANYHOW FOR WHAT YOU DID FOR ME ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND TAKE IT AND AND GIVE IT TO THE PERSON FOR WHOM YOU WERE ABOUT TO PURCHASE A DIAMOND TO NIGHT
