4697-100165-0000 JACK AND HIS SISTER NINA WERE TWO LITTLE ORPHANS WHO HAD TO BEG FROM DOOR TO DOOR FOR THEIR FOOD AND A PLACE TO SLEEP ONE DAY A MAN NAMED SIMON TOLD THEM IF THEY WOULD WORK FOR HIM HE WOULD GIVE THEM A HOME
4697-100165-0001 JACK AND NINA THOUGHT SIMON MUST BE A VERY KIND HEARTED MAN TO OFFER THEM A HOME SO THEY WORKED JUST AS HARD AS THEY COULD TO REPAY HIM BUT IN THIS THEY WERE MISTAKEN
4697-100165-0002 FOR SIMON WAS A VERY GREEDY HARD HEARTED MAN AND ONLY OFFERED TO TAKE THE CHILDREN THAT HE MIGHT GET THEIR WORK FOR NOTHING
4697-100165-0003 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BOTH MUCH TOO SMALL TO DO SUCH HARD WORK IN RETURN SIMON GAVE THEM A PLACE TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR OF THE ATTIC AND VERY LITTLE TO EAT IF HE HAD NINA COOK MEAT FOR HIS DINNER
4697-100165-0004 HE WOULD SIT BY THE STOVE AND WATCH THAT SHE DID NOT EAT ANY OF IT
4697-100165-0005 HE WOULD LEAVE THE BONES AND GRISTLE FOR POOR LITTLE JACK AND NINA WHO WERE HALF STARVED ONE DAY SIMON TOLD JACK HE WAS GOING TO SELL THE BIG BRINDLE COW TO THE BUTCHER AND THAT HE WAS TO DRIVE HER THE NEXT DAY TO THE TOWN A FEW MILES AWAY
4697-100165-0006 JACK AND NINA WERE VERY FOND OF BRINDLE COW AND WEPT BITTERLY WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THEY BEGGED SIMON NOT TO LET THE BUTCHER HAVE HER BUT HE TOLD THEM HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ANY SUCH SILLY CHATTER AND FOR JACK TO BE OFF THE NEXT MORNING BRIGHT AND EARLY
4697-100165-0007 NINA PUT HER ARMS AROUND BRINDLE COW AND CRIED WHEN JACK WAS READY TO LEAD HER AWAY AND WATCHED THEM DOWN THE ROAD
4697-100165-0008 AND SHE WENT BACK TO GET SIMON'S BREAKFAST WITH A SAD HEART WHEN JACK CAME TO THE WOODS HE LED BRINDLE COW TO A STREAM TO DRINK AND WHILE HE SAT ON THE BANK WAITING
4697-100165-0009 HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE A FAIRY SLIP OUT OF A LILY AS IT OPENED I THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING SAID THE LITTLE CREATURE
4697-100165-0010 HE WAS SO SURPRISED BRINDLE COW ANSWERED WE HAD TO WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT YOU KNOW SHE SAID
4697-100165-0011 BUT THE SUN WILL SOON BE UP AND I MUST GET HOME BEFORE THAT SAID THE FAIRY NOW WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU SAVE MY LIFE I AM ON THE WAY TO THE BUTCHER NOW REPLIED BRINDLE COW
4697-100165-0012 YOU TOLD ME THAT DAY I DID NOT EAT THE FIELD FLOWER IN WHICH YOU WERE SLEEPING THAT YOU WOULD HELP ME IF EVER I WAS IN NEED OF HELP SAID BRINDLE COW LAST NIGHT I SAW ONE OF YOUR SISTERS AND TOLD HER MY SAD PLIGHT
4697-100165-0013 I SAID OH SHE WILL BE BY THE STREAM IN THE WOOD SHE SITS IN A LILY UNTIL IT IS TIME TO GO HOME IN THE MORNING I WILL TELL HER
4697-100165-0014 OF COURSE I WILL HELP YOU SAID THE FIELD FAIRY I WILL CHANGE YOU INTO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WHAT SHALL IT BE THERE IS ANOTHER THING GOOD FIELD FAIRY SAID BRINDLE COW
4697-100165-0015 THIS POOR BOY WILL BE PUNISHED IF I AM NOT CARRIED TO THE BUTCHER AND THE MONEY HE GETS CARRIED BACK TO SIMON THIS BOY AND HIS SISTER HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TO ME THEY NEVER FORGOT TO BRING ME WATER
4697-100165-0016 AND GAVE ME SALT MANY TIMES WHEN THEIR MASTER DID NOT KNOW IT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO GET THEM INTO TROUBLE EVEN TO SAVE MY LIFE OH PLEASE DO NOT MIND US SAID JACK
4697-100165-0017 WHO AT LAST WAS ABLE TO SPEAK NINA AND I WILL NOT MIND BEING PUNISHED IF ONLY YOU CAN ESCAPE THE BUTCHER
4697-100165-0018 SAID THE FAIRY THAT WILL SAVE YOU FROM THE BUTCHER
4697-100165-0019 IT IS THIS INSTEAD OF CHANGING YOU INTO SOME OTHER SHAPE WHY NOT CHANGE YOUR MASTER INTO A KIND AND GOOD MAN OH THAT WOULD BE BEST OF ALL SAID JACK THAT IS IF
4697-100165-0020 BRINDLE COW DOES NOT OBJECT TO REMAINING A COW I WOULD RATHER BE A COW IF I CAN BE SURE I AM GOING TO LIVE REPLIED BRINDLE COW
4697-100165-0021 BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND OF COURSE THERE CAN BE NO JOY IN LIFE FOR ME WITH THAT BUTCHER STARING ME IN THE FACE WELL THAT IS ALL SETTLED THEN REPLIED THE FAIRY
4697-100165-0022 FOR IT IS COOL AND SHADY ALONG THE ROAD TO THE FARM YOU TWO WAIT HERE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS JACK WONDERED WHAT THE FIELD FAIRY INTENDED TO DO BUT HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED NOW AT ANYTHING SO HE BEGAN TO PICK SOME BERRIES
4697-100165-0023 FOR HE HAD NOT HAD HIS BREAKFAST AND NOW BRINDLE COW WAS SURE SHE WAS NOT GOING TO THE BUTCHER SO SHE BEGAN TO EAT THE SWEET GRASS BY THE STREAM JACK THOUGHT SHE MIGHT SPEAK AGAIN AND HE PATTED HER SIDES AND NOSE
4697-100165-0024 BUT THE ONLY ANSWER BRINDLE COW MADE WAS TO RUB HER NOSE AGAINST HIM AND MOO AFTER A WHILE JACK HEARD SOME ONE CALLING HIS NAME AND RUNNING DOWN THE ROAD IT WAS NINA
4697-100165-0025 COME QUICKLY SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO SIMON JACK LET BRINDLE COW TAKE CARE OF HERSELF AND HURRIED AFTER NINA WONDERING WHAT THE FAIRY HAD DONE TO SIMON BUT IT SEEMED THAT SIMON HAD BROUGHT ON HIS TROUBLE HIMSELF
4697-100165-0026 BY TRYING TO SAVE THE WOOD THAT MORNING WHEN NINA TOLD HIM SHE NEEDED MORE WOOD FOR THE FIRE INSTEAD OF GIVING HER MORE WOOD
4697-100165-0027 WHEN JACK AND NINA REACHED THE FARMHOUSE SIMON WAS ON THE FLOOR GROANING WITH PAIN
4697-100165-0028 JACK AND NINA LIFTED HIM FROM THE FLOOR AND PLACED HIM ON HIS BED
4697-100165-0029 NINA BATHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND JACK BANDAGED THEM AND BY AND BY HE FELL ASLEEP WHEN HE AWOKE HE ASKED FOR SOME GRUEL AND THEN HE REMEMBERED BRINDLE COW POOR CREATURE SAID SIMON
4697-100165-0030 EVEN IF SHE WAS GETTING OLD BUT IT IS TOO LATE NOW FOR OF COURSE THE BUTCHER HAS HER JUST THEN MOO
4697-100165-0031 JACK THOUGHT OF BRINDLE COW WHY THERE SHE IS NOW HE SAID I DID NOT GET TO THE BUTCHER'S THIS MORNING BECAUSE NINA CALLED ME BEFORE I HAD GONE BEYOND THE WOODS I'LL NEVER SELL HER SAID SIMON GO OUT JACK AND GIVE HER A GOOD DINNER
4697-100165-0032 AND TO NIGHT SEE THAT SHE HAS A NICE BED OF STRAW IN THE BARN THAT DAY FOR DINNER SIMON TOLD NINA TO HAVE A GOOD MEAT STEW
4697-100165-0033 JACK TOLD NINA WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE STREAM IN THE WOODS
4697-100165-0034 OF COURSE NOT SAID NINA FAIRIES ALWAYS DO GOOD NOT BAD THINGS AND BESIDES SIMON MUST HAVE BEEN BURNT AT THE VERY TIME YOU SAW THE FAIRY
4697-100165-0035 JACK WAS QUITE SURE HE DID NOT DREAM IT BUT NEVER AGAIN DID BRINDLE COW SPEAK AT LEAST JACK NEVER HEARD HER IF SHE DID BUT WHEN SIMON RECOVERED FROM HIS BURNS AND WAS QUITE WELL AGAIN
4697-100165-0036 SOMETHING DID HAPPEN AND WHETHER THE FIELD FAIRY AND BRINDLE COW HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT JACK AND NINA NEVER KNEW SIMON WAS A CHANGED MAN THAT WAS SURE HE WOULD NOT LET NINA DO THE WORK ANY MORE BUT SENT BOTH OF THE CHILDREN TO SCHOOL
4697-100165-0037 HE FIXED UP THE HOUSE AND BOUGHT NEW FURNITURE AND BEST OF ALL HE BOUGHT NICE CLOTHING FOR JACK AND NINA AND IF YOU DON'T MIND SAID SIMON TO JACK AND NINA ONE DAY I WISH YOU WOULD CALL ME UNCLE SIMON
4697-100165-0038 HE EVEN BOUGHT A NICE HORSE AND PRETTY WILLOW CARRIAGE FOR THE CHILDREN TO DRIVE TO SCHOOL IN FACT EVERYBODY THOUGHT SIMON MUST HAVE LOST HIS MIND HE WAS SO CHANGED IT MUST BE THE WORK OF THE FIELD FAIRY SAID JACK
4697-100165-0039 SHE SAID SHE WOULD CHANGE HIM INTO A KIND AND GOOD MAN PERHAPS SHE CAME AND FOUND HIM BURNT AND THOUGHT SHE WOULD WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM SAID NINA BUT I THINK YOU FELL ASLEEP THAT MORNING JACK WHILE YOU WERE WAITING FOR BRINDLE COW TO DRINK AT THE STREAM
4697-100165-0040 BRINDLE COW SAW THE FAIRY DIDN'T YOU BRINDLE ASKED JACK AS BRINDLE COW CAME UP TO THE STONE WALL WHERE JACK AND NINA STOOD BRINDLE COW LOOKED OVER THE WALL STRAIGHT AT JACK AND ANSWERED
4697-100165-0041 IT DOES NOT MATTER JACK SAID NINA WITH A LAUGH AS SHE PATTED BRINDLE COW ON THE NOSE IT HAS ALL TURNED OUT SO WELL AND UNCLE SIMON COULD NOT BE KINDER OR NICER TO US NOW IF HE WERE OUR FATHER
4697-100165-0042 SOMETIMES I THINK IT IS ALL BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS SO SICK AND HELPLESS THAT WE WERE KIND TO HIM AND DID ALL WE COULD EVEN THOUGH HE HAD ALMOST STARVED US AND MADE US WORK SO HARD
