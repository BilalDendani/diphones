5379-15784-0000 WHO WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE HIS FATHER WAS A GENERAL IN THE NAVY NOW THIS REQUIRES A LITTLE EXPLANATION MY GRANDFATHER YOU MUST KNOW WAS MASTER AT ARMS ON BOARD THE ROYAL STANDARD SEVENTY FOUR GUNS
5379-15784-0001 IT WAS HIS DUTY AS A WARRANT OFFICER TO OFFICIATE WHEN A MAN WAS TO BE FLOGGED FOR GETTING DRUNK OR ANY OTHER CRIME THEY WERE TIED UP TO A GRATING AND PUNISHED WITH THE CAT IN THOSE DAYS
5379-15784-0002 THANK GOODNESS IT IS NOT SO NOW IN THE BRITISH NAVY IT WAS THE DUTY OF THE ARMORER TO ATTEND THE SURGEON OF THE SHIP IN FULL UNIFORM WITH DRAWN SWORD TO SEE THAT THE PRISONER RECEIVED HIS ALLOWANCE
5379-15784-0003 AND THE DOCTOR'S DUTY WAS TO TELL THE BOATSWAIN TO CAST THE MAN OFF WHEN HE SAW HE COULD BEAR NO MORE SO THIS IS HOW THE AFORESAID SON OF A GUN'S GRANDFATHER WAS NICKNAMED THE FLOGMASTER GENERAL GUN WAS ARMORER'S MATE
5379-15784-0004 FOUGHT IN THREE ENGAGEMENTS AND GOT HIS DISCHARGE WITHOUT PENSION HIS BROTHER WAS NOT SO FORTUNATE HE ROSE BY MERIT TO BE A SECOND LIEUTENANT AND ONE DAY WAS ORDERED TO MAN THE BOAT AND GO ON SHORE AT PORTSMOUTH WITH ORDERS FOR THE SHIP
5379-15784-0005 WHEN HE REACHED THE STAIRS THE MEN BEGGED SO HARD TO BE ALLOWED TO GO ON SHORE FOR A SHORT TIME TO PURCHASE SOME NECESSARIES THAT GUN'S BROTHER GAVE THEM LEAVE ON THEIR ENGAGING ON HONOUR TO RETURN SOON
5379-15784-0006 IMAGINE HIS FEELINGS WHEN HE RETURNED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS MEN HAD DESERTED IN THIS DILEMMA GUN'S BROTHER DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO TO GO ON BOARD HE WAS ASHAMED AND THEREFORE HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF THE MEN AND BOLT
5379-15784-0007 HE DID SO WAS CAUGHT
5379-15784-0008 THEY CAME THE NEXT MORNING AND TOOK HIM ON BOARD AND PLACED HIM IN IRONS A COURT MARTIAL WAS CALLED HE WAS REDUCED FROM LIEUTENANT TO COMMON SEAMAN
5379-15784-0009 AND THEN THEY SENTENCED HIM TO TWO DOZEN LASHES WHICH HE RECEIVED ON HIS BIRTHDAY AS A VERY UNWELCOME PRESENT GUN OBTAINED HIS DISCHARGE WENT TO LONDON AND GOT MARRIED
5379-15784-0010 I BEING THE WIND UP OF THE LOT WHICH CONSISTED OF NINE BOYS AND ONE GIRL NOW BEGAN SOME OF THE STIRRING AND PAINFUL EVENTS OF MY WONDERFUL LIFE MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS ONLY FIVE MONTHS OLD AND MY SISTER BECAME MY ONLY NURSE
5379-15784-0011 SHE USED TO CARRY ME ROUND THE PARISH TO MOTHERS WHO HAD BABIES AND BEG A DROP OF MILK FROM ONE AND ANOTHER SO THAT I HAD MANY FOSTER MOTHERS NOW IT SO HAPPENED THAT I HAD A RICH AUNT AND SHE MADE AN OFFER TO OLD GUN THAT IF HE WOULD GIVE ME UP ENTIRELY TO HER CARE
5379-15784-0012 WHICH OFFER OLD GUN READILY ACCEPTED THE WILL WAS MADE AND DULY REGISTERED AND I WAS TAKEN FROM OLD GUN AND PLACED UNDER THE CARE OF A GOOD NURSE OLD GUN TOOK TO DRINK
5379-15784-0013 AND WHEN DRUNK VISITED MY NURSE AND LISTENED TO HER COMPLAINTS AGAINST MY AUNT HE CALLED AND HAD WORDS WITH HER WHICH SO DISGUSTED THE OLD LADY THAT SHE SENT FOR A LAWYER AND ALTERED HER WILL WITHOUT LEAVING ME A SINGLE PENNY SO MUCH FOR DRINK
5379-15784-0014 I REMAINED WITH THIS NURSE ABOUT FIVE YEARS ABOUT THIS TIME I WAS NEARLY BURNED TO DEATH MY NURSE HAVING LEFT ME TO MIND THE HOUSE I GOT PLAYING WITH THE FIRE
5379-15784-0015 TWO WORKING MEN WHO HAPPENED TO BE PASSING SEIZED ME AND THREW ME INTO A DITCH CLOSE BY AFTER THAT THEY TOOK ME TO A DOCTOR AND I WAS LAID UP IN BED FOR TWELVE MONTHS WHEN OLD GUN HEARD OF IT HE TOOK ME AWAY FROM MY NURSE
5379-15784-0016 AND WHEN HE GOT ME HOME HE MADE USE OF ME TO FETCH HIS GIN WHILE HE WAS ON THE DRINK I REMEMBER FETCHING GUN AS MANY AS NINETEEN HALF QUARTERNS OF GIN BEFORE DINNER AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD BE ON THE FUDDLE FOR A FORTNIGHT
5379-15784-0017 GUN HAVING GOT INTO DEBT WITH A PUBLICAN TO THE EXTENT OF TWO POUNDS HE SUMMONED HIM FOR THE AMOUNT AS GUN REFUSED TO PAY
5379-15784-0018 I USED TO VISIT FATHER GUN IN PRISON AND TAKE HIM COFFEE AND SUGAR NOW WHILE GUN WAS IN TROUBLE I WAS ALSO DOOMED TO SUFFER GUN'S LANDLADY REFUSED TO GIVE ME A NIGHT'S LODGING
5379-15784-0019 I LIVED ON THE FEW COPPERS EARNED BY RUNNING ABOUT THE CITY AND HOLDING GENTLEMEN'S HORSES AT LAST TO GET RID OF ME THE LANDLADY TOOK ME TO THE WORKHOUSE AND LEFT ME THERE TILL GUN CAME OUT OF PRISON
5379-15784-0020 AT LAST THE END CAME AND GUN DIED A PENITENT SINNER THE PARISH APPRENTICED ME TO A SHOE MAKER A MAN THAT WANTED THE PREMIUM MUCH MORE THAN HE WANTED THE BOY MY MASTER TREATED ME MORE LIKE A DOG THAN A HUMAN BEING
5379-15784-0021 I WAS FED BADLY AND CLOTHED WORSE WAS ALLOWED ONE SUIT OF THE COMMONEST CORDEROY THAT COULD BE GOT PER YEAR IN FACT I WORE ONE PAIR OF TROUSERS UNTIL THEY BECAME KNEEBREECHES ONE PAIR OF COMMON BOOTS A YEAR AND A GOOD SOUND THRASHING TWICE A WEEK
5379-15784-0022 NOT ONLY WERE MY HOURS OF LABOR FROM FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING UNTIL TEN AT NIGHT BUT MY FARE WAS FAR WORSE
5379-15784-0023 NOW IT SO HAPPENED AT THIS PERIOD OF MY LIFE THAT I TOOK A FANCY TO SWIMMING AND IN ORDER TO GAIN A KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ART I USED TO GET UP VERY EARLY EVERY MORNING AND BATHE IN A CANAL WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF THIS PASTIME NEARLY COST ME MY LIFE
5379-15784-0024 NO LESS THAN THREE TIMES I WAS BROUGHT OUT OF THE WATER NEARLY DEAD BUT I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE BEATEN AND AFTER TAKING LESSONS OF A PROFESSOR I BECAME A VERY FAIR SWIMMER I SOON FOUND THAT MY MASTER WAS A BAD MAN
5379-15784-0025 THE WOMAN THAT LIVED WITH HIM HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND A RESPECTABLE FARMER IN YORKSHIRE AND BOTH THESE WORTHIES TOOK TO HEAVY DRINKING AT THIS TIME I WAS BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE
5379-15784-0026 AT LAST BEING GREATLY TROUBLED IN HIS MIND HE DETERMINED TO SHOOT NOT HIMSELF BUT THE MOON AS IT WAS CALLED IN LONDON WHICH BEING INTERPRETED MEANS THAT HE RAN AWAY FROM HIS HOUSE IN THE NIGHT TIME NOT FORGETTING TO TAKE HIS GOODS WITH HIM
5379-15784-0027 BUT IN HIS HURRY AND EXCITEMENT LEFT AN OLD BEDSTEAD IN THE HOUSE I WAS ORDERED TO GO EARLY THE NEXT MORNING AND GET THIS BEDSTEAD OUT BY THE BACK DOOR MY MASTER BEING THERE TO HELP ME CARRY IT HOME
5379-15784-0028 TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK I HAD TO GET THROUGH THE CELLAR WINDOW I SUCCEEDED IN TAKING DOWN THE BEDSTEAD PUT THE SCREWS IN MY POCKET AND GOT IT OUTSIDE WHEN ALAS I BEHELD THAT KINDEST OF FRIENDS THE POLICEMAN
5379-15784-0029 WHO MOST AFFECTIONATELY PUT HIS HAND UPON MY ARM AND MARCHED ME OFF TO THE LOCKUP ON A CHARGE OF HOUSE BREAKING I WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE AND THE LANDLADY APPEARED AGAINST ME
5379-15784-0030 I WAS KEPT IN PRISON ELEVEN DAYS BEFORE MY TRIAL AND NO ONE WAS ALLOWED TO SEE ME BUT MY FELLOW PRISONERS AND WHEN AT LAST I WAS TRIED I PLEADED MY OWN CASE AND SUCCEEDED IN JUSTIFYING MY CONDUCT BY EXPLAINING THAT I WAS ONLY AN APPRENTICE
5379-15784-0031 AND THEREFORE BOUND TO OBEY MY MASTER'S ORDERS AND KEEP HIS SECRETS ACCORDING TO THE WORDING OF MY INDENTURES AND SO I WAS HONOURABLY ACQUITTED
5379-15784-0032 I HAD TO ATTEND CHAPEL NOW ANY MORAL OR RELIGIOUS BENEFIT I MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED FROM SUCH ATTENDANCE WAS UTTERLY NEUTRALIZED BY BAD MANAGEMENT OF OUR PRISONS IN COMPELLING COMPARATIVELY INNOCENT PERSONS TO MIX WITH THE GREATEST BLACKGUARDS AND THIEVES IN LONDON
5379-15784-0033 WHO WERE GUILTY OF EVERY CRIME YOU CAN MENTION INCLUDING MURDER AMONGST THEM HOWEVER
5379-15784-0034 WHO WAS IMPRISONED FOR SPEAKING AGAINST THE BIBLE AND THE GOVERNMENT HE USED TO LECTURE AT THE ROTUNDA IN THE BLACKFRIAR'S ROAD HE MADE MY ACQUAINTANCE AND TAUGHT ME MANY GOOD THINGS AND ALTHOUGH A PRISONER HE WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS A BAD MAN
5379-15784-0035 FOR HE HAD THE FEAR OF GOD IN HIS HEART HE PERSUADED ME TO ATTEND SUNDAY SCHOOL AND CHURCH WHEN I GOT OUT
5379-15784-0036 ESPECIALLY WHEN INJUDICIOUSLY ADMINISTERED I DID NOT FORGET HIS GOOD COUNSEL FOR WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY MASTER I BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO GO TO A SUNDAY SCHOOL AND ALSO TO CHURCH THIS REQUEST WAS GRANTED
5379-15784-0037 AND MANY A TIME I WENT WITHOUT MY SUNDAY'S DINNER RATHER THAN BE LATE AT SCHOOL THE PARISH CLERK FOUND OUT THAT I HAD A VOICE SO HE SENT FOR ME
5379-15784-0038 I FELT VERY PROUD OF THIS AND ALTHOUGH I OCCASIONALLY RECEIVED A GOOD THRASHING FROM MY MASTER FOR THE MOST TRIFLING MISTAKES IN MY WORK I BORE UP WELL TILL I WAS NEARLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE BY THIS TIME HOWEVER MY MASTER'S TREATMENT GREW RATHER WORSE THAN BETTER
5379-15784-0039 SO I DETERMINED TO RUN AWAY AND TRY THE COUNTRY FOR A CHANGE OF AIR I HAD A MARRIED BROTHER LIVING AT HASTINGS IN SUSSEX AND TO GO THERE I BEGAN TO SAVE UP FOR THE JOURNEY OUT OF MY POCKET MONEY WHICH WAS ONLY THREEPENCE PER WEEK OUT OF WHICH I SAVED TWO THIRDS
5379-15784-0040 AT LENGTH WITH MY SAVINGS WHICH AMOUNTED TO TENPENCE A TWO POUND LOAF AND NO BUTTER I ROSE AT THREE O'CLOCK ON A BEAUTIFUL SUMMER'S MORNING AND CREPT DOWN STAIRS VERY SOFTLY OPENED THE DOOR AND GOT OUTSIDE WITHOUT BEING HEARD BY ANY OF THE INMATES
5379-15784-0041 AFTER WALKING ABOUT FIVE MILES WITHOUT RESTING I BEGAN TO SING A VERSE FROM AN OLD MAN A WAR SONG AS FOLLOWS I WISH I WAS AT HASTINGS WITH MY TRUE LOVE ALONG WITH ME EVERYTHING THAT'S FITTING TO SERVE HIS ROYAL MAJESTY
5379-15784-0042 WHERE LIQUOR THERE IS PLENTY FLOWING BOWLS ON EVERY SIDE HARD FORTUNE NE'ER SHALL DAUNT ME FOR I'M YOUNG AND THE WORLD IS WIDE AFTER WALKING EIGHT MILES I HAD A REST AND REFRESHED THE INNER MAN WITH BREAD AND WATER
5379-15784-0043 THE VERY PLACE I WAS BOUND FOR I MADE A DART AND GOT UP BEHIND WHEN THE DRIVER STOPPED TO CHANGE HORSES I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD ALLOW ME TO RIDE BEHIND FOR WHICH PRIVILEGE I OFFERED TO SKID THE WHEEL WHICH MEANS IN RAILWAY LANGUAGE PUT ON THE BRAKE
5379-15784-0044 WAS VERY KIND FOR THE REST OF THE JOURNEY I ARRIVED SAFE AND SOUND THE SAME NIGHT AND FOUND OUT MY BROTHER'S RESIDENCE BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY BROTHER WAS TEN MILES FROM HOME WORKING AT A GENTLEMAN'S SEAT AND DID NOT RETURN FOR A WEEK AFTER MY ARRIVAL
5379-15784-0045 MY SISTER IN LAW WAS VERY GOOD TO ME AT FIRST BUT SOON BEGAN TO SPEAK IN TERMS THAT CONVINCED ME THAT SHE WAS NO FRIEND OF MINE SHE USED TO DRINK GIN ON THE SLY AND GET DRUNK AND DECEIVE HER HUSBAND BY MAKING HIM BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS ILL
5379-15784-0046 FEARING THAT I WOULD LET MY BROTHER INTO THE SECRET SHE BECAME MY BITTER ENEMY I SAW THROUGH IT AND WHEN I HAD MANAGED TO GET WORK I LEFT MY BROTHER'S HOUSE AND TOOK LODGINGS AMONGST A TRIBE OF GIPSIES WHO LIVED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
5379-15784-0047 MY NEW MASTER WAS A REGULAR OUT AND OUTER A SPLENDID WORKMAN WELL EDUCATED A GOOD RECITER BUT TOO FOND OF COMPANY AND DRINK WHICH KEPT HIM POOR AND MADE HIS WIFE MISERABLE
5379-15784-0048 SHE WAS VERY GOOD TO ME AND GAVE ME MANY A MEAL WHEN MY MASTER WAS ON THE SPREE I LEFT THE GIPSIES AND FOUND CHEAP LODGINGS BY THE SAD SEA WAVES IN THE FISHING BOATS
5379-15784-0049 I USED TO RISE EARLY AND ASSIST THE FISHERMEN TO WASH AND PACK THEIR FISH FOR MARKET FOR WHICH SERVICE I USED TO GET A FISH FOR BREAKFAST IT WAS AT HASTINGS THAT I IMPROVED IN THE ART OF SWIMMING I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE SEA THREE TIMES A DAY
5379-15784-0050 AND SO THE TIME ROLLED ON I IMPROVED IN MY TRADE BUT UNFORTUNATELY AT THE END OF THE SEASON I HAD NO WORK TO DO I THEN TOOK IT INTO MY HEAD THAT I WOULD RETURN TO LONDON AND FIND OUT MY SISTER THE NEXT QUESTION WAS HOW TO GET THERE WITHOUT MONEY TO START
5379-15784-0051 I STARTED ACCORDINGLY EARLY ONE MORNING AND WALKED EIGHT MILES TO A PLACE CALLED BATTLE THE SPOT WHERE THE GREAT BATTLE OF HASTINGS TOOK PLACE WHEN I ARRIVED I FOUND THERE WAS A FOX HUNT ON AND THAT AFTER THE HUNT THERE WAS TO BE A DINNER FOR THE SPORTSMEN
5379-15784-0052 SO I MADE UP MY MIND TO STAY AND OFFER MY SERVICES AS A SINGER AND TRUST TO THEIR GENEROSITY AS TO WHAT THEY WOULD GIVE ME I DID SO AND SO PLEASED THE COMPANY THAT THEY GAVE ME A GOOD DINNER AND FOUR AND NINEPENCE TO BOOT
5379-15784-0053 AND THE LANDLORD GAVE ME A NIGHT'S LODGING I STARTED NEXT MORNING FOR TUNBRIDGE IN KENT NEXT I WENT TO MAIDSTONE WHERE I MET WITH A HARPIST WITH WHOM I JOINED COMPANY I TO SING AND HARPY TO PLAY AND GO SHARE IN THE PROFITS
5379-15784-0054 WE WAITED ON THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN AND GOT HIS PERMISSION TO PLAY AND SING IN THE STREETS WE DID WELL LIVED LIKE FIGHTING COCKS AND SAVED MONEY FROM MAIDSTONE WE TRAVELLED TO SITTINGBOURNE
5379-15784-0055 WHERE WE WERE ENGAGED TO PLAY AND SING IN THE ASSEMBLY ROOMS AND THERE MADE A GREAT HIT IN MY SONG FUNKING THE COBBLER SUNG IN CARICATURE I NOW BEGAN TO FANCY MYSELF
