2162-164461-0000 ROMANCE IS PERHAPS THE HIGHEST POINT OF HUMAN EXPRESSION EXCEPT INDEED RELIGION TO WHICH IT IS CLOSELY ALLIED ROMANCE RESEMBLES RELIGION ESPECIALLY IN THIS
2162-164461-0001 BOTH ROMANCE AND RELIGION SEE EVERYTHING AS IT WERE FORESHORTENED THEY SEE EVERYTHING IN AN ABRUPT AND FANTASTIC PERSPECTIVE COMING TO AN APEX IT IS THE WHOLE ESSENCE OF PERSPECTIVE THAT IT COMES TO A POINT
2162-164461-0002 SIMILARLY RELIGION COMES TO A POINT TO THE POINT THUS RELIGION IS ALWAYS INSISTING ON THE SHORTNESS OF HUMAN LIFE BUT IT DOES NOT INSIST ON THE SHORTNESS OF HUMAN LIFE AS THE PESSIMISTS INSIST ON IT
2162-164461-0003 PESSIMISM INSISTS ON THE SHORTNESS OF HUMAN LIFE IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT LIFE IS VALUELESS RELIGION INSISTS ON THE SHORTNESS OF HUMAN LIFE IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT LIFE IS FRIGHTFULLY VALUABLE IS ALMOST HORRIBLY VALUABLE
2162-164461-0004 PESSIMISM SAYS THAT LIFE IS SO SHORT THAT IT GIVES NOBODY A CHANCE RELIGION SAYS THAT LIFE IS SO SHORT THAT IT GIVES EVERYBODY HIS FINAL CHANCE IN THE FIRST CASE
2162-164461-0005 THE WORD BREVITY MEANS FUTILITY IN THE SECOND CASE OPPORTUNITY BUT THE CASE IS EVEN STRONGER THAN THIS RELIGION SHORTENS EVERYTHING RELIGION SHORTENS EVEN ETERNITY
2162-164461-0006 SINCE WE HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT WITH RELIGION PREFERS TO THINK OF IT AS QUICK FOR RELIGION THE FLOWERS SHOOT UP SUDDENLY LIKE ROCKETS FOR RELIGION THE MOUNTAINS ARE LIFTED UP SUDDENLY LIKE WAVES
2162-164461-0007 THOSE WHO QUOTE THAT FINE PASSAGE WHICH SAYS THAT IN GOD'S SIGHT A THOUSAND YEARS ARE AS YESTERDAY THAT IS PASSED AS A WATCH IN THE NIGHT DO NOT REALISE THE FULL FORCE OF THE MEANING
2162-164461-0008 ROMANCE IS A SHORTENING AND SHARPENING OF THE HUMAN DIFFICULTY WHERE YOU AND I HAVE TO VOTE AGAINST A MAN OR WRITE RATHER FEEBLY AGAINST A MAN OR SIGN ILLEGIBLE PETITIONS AGAINST A MAN ROMANCE DOES FOR HIM
2162-164461-0009 WHAT WE SHOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE DONE IT KNOCKS HIM DOWN IT SHORTENS THE SLOW PROCESS OF HISTORICAL JUSTICE ALL ROMANCES CONSIST OF THREE CHARACTERS OTHER CHARACTERS MAY BE INTRODUCED
2162-164461-0010 AS FAR AS THE ROMANCE IS CONCERNED THEY ARE BUSHES THAT WAVE RATHER EXCITEDLY THEY ARE POSTS THAT STAND UP WITH A CERTAIN PRIDE THEY ARE CORRECTLY PAINTED ROCKS THAT FROWN VERY CORRECTLY BUT THEY ARE ALL
2162-164461-0011 LANDSCAPE THEY ARE ALL A BACKGROUND IN EVERY PURE ROMANCE THERE ARE THREE LIVING AND MOVING CHARACTERS FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THEY MAY BE CALLED SAINT GEORGE AND THE DRAGON AND THE PRINCESS
2162-164461-0012 IN EVERY ROMANCE THERE MUST BE THE TWIN ELEMENTS OF LOVING AND FIGHTING IN EVERY ROMANCE THERE MUST BE THE THREE CHARACTERS THERE MUST BE THE PRINCESS WHO IS A THING TO BE LOVED THERE MUST BE THE DRAGON
2162-164461-0013 WHO IS A THING TO BE FOUGHT AND THERE MUST BE SAINT GEORGE WHO IS A THING THAT BOTH LOVES AND FIGHTS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SYMPTOMS OF CYNICISM AND DECAY IN OUR MODERN CIVILISATION
2162-164461-0014 BUT OF ALL THE SIGNS OF MODERN FEEBLENESS OF LACK OF GRASP ON MORALS AS THEY ACTUALLY MUST BE THERE HAS BEEN NONE QUITE SO SILLY OR SO DANGEROUS AS THIS THAT THE PHILOSOPHERS OF TO DAY
2162-164461-0015 HAVE STARTED TO DIVIDE LOVING FROM FIGHTING AND TO PUT THEM INTO OPPOSITE CAMPS THERE COULD BE NO WORSE SIGN THAN THAT A MAN
2162-164461-0016 CAN BE FOUND TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD GO IN FOR FIGHTING INSTEAD OF LOVING
2162-164461-0017 EVEN TOLSTOI CAN BE FOUND TO TELL US
2162-164461-0018 INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THE TWO THINGS IMPLY EACH OTHER THEY IMPLIED EACH OTHER IN THE OLD ROMANCE AND IN THE OLD RELIGION WHICH WERE THE TWO PERMANENT THINGS OF HUMANITY YOU CANNOT LOVE A THING
2162-164461-0019 WITHOUT WANTING TO FIGHT FOR IT YOU CANNOT FIGHT WITHOUT SOMETHING TO FIGHT FOR TO LOVE A THING WITHOUT WISHING TO FIGHT FOR IT IS NOT LOVE AT ALL IT IS LUST IT MAY BE AN AIRY PHILOSOPHICAL AND DISINTERESTED LUST
2162-164461-0020 IT MAY BE SO TO SPEAK A VIRGIN LUST BUT IT IS LUST BECAUSE IT IS WHOLLY SELF INDULGENT AND INVITES NO ATTACK ON THE OTHER HAND FIGHTING FOR A THING WITHOUT LOVING IT IS NOT EVEN FIGHTING
2162-164461-0021 IT CAN ONLY BE CALLED A KIND OF HORSE PLAY THAT IS OCCASIONALLY FATAL WHEREVER HUMAN NATURE IS HUMAN AND UNSPOILT BY ANY SPECIAL SOPHISTRY THERE EXISTS THIS NATURAL KINSHIP BETWEEN WAR AND WOOING
2162-164461-0022 HE KNOWS THAT LOVING THE WORLD IS THE SAME THING AS FIGHTING THE WORLD IT WAS AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN HE OFFERED TO LIKE EVERYBODY HE ALSO OFFERED TO HIT EVERYBODY TO ALMOST EVERY MAN THAT CAN BE CALLED A MAN
2162-164461-0023 THIS ESPECIAL MOMENT OF THE ROMANTIC CULMINATION HAS COME IN THE FIRST RESORT THE MAN WISHED TO LIVE A ROMANCE IN THE SECOND RESORT IN THE LAST AND WORST RESORT HE WAS CONTENT TO WRITE ONE
2162-164461-0024 NOW THERE IS A CERTAIN MOMENT WHEN THIS ELEMENT ENTERS INDEPENDENTLY INTO THE LIFE OF DICKENS THERE IS A PARTICULAR TIME WHEN WE CAN SEE HIM SUDDENLY REALISE THAT HE WANTS TO WRITE A ROMANCE
2162-164461-0025 AND NOTHING ELSE IN READING HIS LETTERS IN APPRECIATING HIS CHARACTER THIS POINT EMERGES CLEARLY ENOUGH HE WAS FULL OF THE AFTERGLOW OF HIS MARRIAGE HE WAS STILL YOUNG AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY IGNORANT
2162-164461-0026 OR GO OFF ON SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALTOGETHER THIS CRUCIAL POINT IN HIS LIFE IS MARKED BY NICHOLAS NICKLEBY IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT BEFORE THIS ISSUE OF NICHOLAS NICKLEBY HIS WORK SUCCESSFUL AS IT WAS
2162-164461-0027 HAD NOT BEEN SUCH AS TO DEDICATE HIM SERIOUSLY OR IRREVOCABLY TO THE WRITING OF NOVELS HE HAD ALREADY WRITTEN THREE BOOKS AND AT LEAST TWO OF THEM ARE CLASSED AMONG THE NOVELS UNDER HIS NAME
2162-164461-0028 BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE ACTUAL ORIGIN AND FORMATION OF THESE BOOKS WE SEE THAT THEY CAME FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND WERE REALLY DESIGNED UPON ANOTHER PLAN THE THREE BOOKS WERE OF COURSE
2162-164461-0029 AND OLIVER TWIST IT IS I SUPPOSE SUFFICIENTLY WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT
2162-164461-0030 AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES ONLY SKETCHES BUT SURELY IT IS QUITE EQUALLY CLEAR THAT THE PICKWICK PAPERS ARE AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES MERELY PAPERS NOR IS THE CASE AT ALL DIFFERENT IN SPIRIT AND ESSENCE WHEN WE COME TO OLIVER TWIST
2162-164461-0031 HE CANNOT PAY LESS ATTENTION TO IT THAN THE AUTHOR DID BUT IN FACT THE CASE LIES FAR DEEPER OLIVER TWIST IS SO MUCH APART FROM THE ORDINARY TRACK OF DICKENS IT IS SO GLOOMY
2162-164461-0032 IT IS SO MUCH ALL IN ONE ATMOSPHERE THAT IT CAN BEST BE CONSIDERED AS AN EXCEPTION OR A SOLITARY EXCURSUS IN HIS WORK PERHAPS IT CAN BEST BE CONSIDERED AS THE EXTENSION OF ONE OF HIS OLD SKETCHES
2162-164461-0033 WHERE HE SAW FAGIN WE ARE STILL IN THE REALM OF SKETCHES AND SKETCHINESS THE PICKWICK PAPERS MAY BE CALLED AN EXTENSION OF ONE OF HIS BRIGHT SKETCHES OLIVER TWIST MAY BE CALLED AN EXTENSION OF ONE OF HIS GLOOMY ONES
2162-164461-0034 HAD HE CONTINUED ALONG THIS LINE ALL HIS BOOKS MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN NOTE BOOKS IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO SPLIT UP ALL HIS SUBSEQUENT BOOKS INTO SCRAPS AND EPISODES SUCH AS THOSE WHICH MAKE UP
2162-164461-0035 OF THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP HE MIGHT HAVE MERELY WRITTEN SHORT STORIES CALLED THE GLORIOUS APOLLOS MISSUS QUILP'S TEA PARTY MISSUS JARLEY'S WAXWORK THE LITTLE SERVANT AND THE DEATH OF A DWARF MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT
2162-164461-0036 WE MIGHT HAVE LOST THAT STEADY LOVE OF A SEMINAL AND GROWING ROMANCE WHICH GREW ON HIM STEADILY AS THE YEARS ADVANCED AND WHICH GAVE US TOWARDS THE END SOME OF HIS GREATEST TRIUMPHS ALL HIS BOOKS
