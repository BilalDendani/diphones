8012-273137-0006 I DON'T SEE WHERE THE COMFORTING COMES IN MYSELF SAID MARILLA WHY BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO NICE AND ROMANTIC
8012-273137-0007 I AM SO FOND OF ROMANTIC THINGS AND A GRAVEYARD FULL OF BURIED HOPES
8012-273137-0008 ISN'T IT I'M RATHER GLAD I HAVE ONE ARE WE GOING ACROSS THE LAKE OF SHINING WATERS TODAY

8012-273137-0012 JUST YOU STICK TO BALD FACTS BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING WHERE WERE YOU BORN AND HOW OLD ARE YOU I WAS ELEVEN LAST MARCH SAID ANNE RESIGNING HERSELF TO BALD FACTS WITH A LITTLE SIGH AND I WAS BORN IN BOLINGBROKE NOVA SCOTIA
8012-273137-0013 MY FATHER'S NAME WAS WALTER SHIRLEY
8012-273137-0014 MY MOTHER'S NAME WAS BERTHA SHIRLEY AREN'T WALTER AND BERTHA LOVELY NAMES I'M SO GLAD MY PARENTS HAD NICE NAMES IT WOULD BE A REAL DISGRACE TO HAVE A FATHER NAMED WELL SAY
8012-273137-0015 WELL I DON'T KNOW ANNE LOOKED THOUGHTFUL I READ IN A BOOK ONCE THAT A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME WOULD SMELL AS SWEET BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO BELIEVE IT
8012-273137-0016 I SUPPOSE MY FATHER COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD MAN EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN CALLED JEDEDIAH
8012-273137-0017 A HUSBAND WAS ENOUGH RESPONSIBILITY
8012-273137-0018 MUSLIN CURTAINS GIVE A HOUSE
8012-273137-0019 I WAS BORN IN THAT HOUSE MISSUS THOMAS SAID I WAS THE HOMELIEST BABY SHE EVER SAW I WAS SO SCRAWNY AND TINY AND NOTHING BUT EYES BUT THAT MOTHER THOUGHT I WAS PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL
8012-273137-0020 I SHOULD THINK A MOTHER WOULD BE A BETTER JUDGE THAN A POOR WOMAN WHO CAME IN TO SCRUB WOULDN'T YOU
8012-273137-0021 SHE DIED OF FEVER WHEN I WAS JUST THREE MONTHS OLD I DO WISH SHE'D LIVED LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO REMEMBER CALLING HER MOTHER I THINK IT WOULD BE SO SWEET TO SAY MOTHER DON'T YOU AND FATHER DIED FOUR DAYS AFTERWARDS FROM FEVER TOO
8012-273137-0022 THAT LEFT ME AN ORPHAN AND FOLKS WERE AT THEIR WITS END SO MISSUS THOMAS SAID WHAT TO DO WITH ME YOU SEE NOBODY WANTED ME EVEN THEN IT SEEMS TO BE MY FATE FATHER AND MOTHER HAD BOTH COME FROM PLACES FAR AWAY
8012-273137-0023 AND IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HADN'T ANY RELATIVES LIVING FINALLY MISSUS THOMAS SAID SHE'D TAKE ME THOUGH SHE WAS POOR AND HAD A DRUNKEN HUSBAND SHE BROUGHT ME UP BY HAND DO YOU KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN BEING BROUGHT UP BY HAND THAT OUGHT TO MAKE PEOPLE WHO ARE BROUGHT UP THAT WAY BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE
8012-273137-0024 THEN MISTER THOMAS WAS KILLED FALLING UNDER A TRAIN AND HIS MOTHER OFFERED TO TAKE MISSUS THOMAS AND THE CHILDREN BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT ME MISSUS THOMAS WAS AT HER WITS END SO SHE SAID WHAT TO DO WITH ME
8012-273137-0025 THEN MISSUS HAMMOND FROM UP THE RIVER CAME DOWN AND SAID SHE'D TAKE ME SEEING I WAS HANDY WITH CHILDREN
8012-273137-0026 MISTER HAMMOND WORKED A LITTLE SAWMILL UP THERE AND MISSUS HAMMOND HAD EIGHT CHILDREN SHE HAD TWINS THREE TIMES I LIKE BABIES IN MODERATION BUT TWINS THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION IS TOO MUCH I TOLD MISSUS HAMMOND SO FIRMLY WHEN THE LAST PAIR CAME
8012-273137-0027 I USED TO GET SO DREADFULLY TIRED CARRYING THEM ABOUT I LIVED UP RIVER WITH MISSUS HAMMOND OVER TWO YEARS AND THEN MISTER HAMMOND DIED AND MISSUS HAMMOND BROKE UP HOUSEKEEPING SHE DIVIDED HER CHILDREN AMONG HER RELATIVES AND WENT TO THE STATES
8012-273137-0028 BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD TAKE ME THEY DIDN'T WANT ME AT THE ASYLUM EITHER THEY SAID THEY WERE OVER CROWDED AS IT WAS BUT THEY HAD TO TAKE ME AND I WAS THERE FOUR MONTHS UNTIL MISSUS SPENCER CAME ANNE FINISHED UP WITH ANOTHER SIGH OF RELIEF THIS TIME
8012-273137-0029 EVIDENTLY SHE DID NOT LIKE TALKING ABOUT HER EXPERIENCES IN A WORLD THAT HAD NOT WANTED HER DID YOU EVER GO TO SCHOOL DEMANDED MARILLA TURNING THE SORREL MARE DOWN THE SHORE ROAD
8012-273137-0030 WHEN I WENT UP RIVER WE WERE SO FAR FROM A SCHOOL THAT I COULDN'T WALK IT IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A VACATION IN SUMMER
8012-273137-0031 WERE THOSE WOMEN MISSUS THOMAS AND MISSUS HAMMOND GOOD TO YOU
8012-273137-0032 LOOKING AT ANNE OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE
8012-273137-0033 HER SENSITIVE LITTLE FACE SUDDENLY FLUSHED SCARLET AND EMBARRASSMENT SAT ON HER BROW OH THEY MEANT TO BE I KNOW THEY MEANT TO BE JUST AS GOOD AND KIND AS POSSIBLE AND WHEN PEOPLE MEAN TO BE GOOD TO YOU YOU DON'T MIND VERY MUCH WHEN THEY'RE NOT QUITE ALWAYS THEY HAD A GOOD DEAL TO WORRY THEM YOU KNOW
8012-273137-0034 TWINS THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION DON'T YOU THINK BUT I FEEL SURE THEY MEANT TO BE GOOD TO ME MARILLA ASKED NO MORE QUESTIONS ANNE GAVE HERSELF UP TO A SILENT RAPTURE OVER THE SHORE ROAD AND MARILLA GUIDED THE SORREL ABSTRACTEDLY
8012-273137-0035 WHILE SHE PONDERED DEEPLY PITY WAS SUDDENLY STIRRING IN HER HEART FOR THE CHILD WHAT A STARVED UNLOVED LIFE SHE HAD HAD A LIFE OF DRUDGERY AND POVERTY AND NEGLECT
8012-273137-0036 HE WAS SET ON IT AND THE CHILD SEEMED A NICE TEACHABLE LITTLE THING SHE'S GOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THOUGHT MARILLA
8012-273137-0037 THE SHORE ROAD WAS WOODSY AND WILD AND LONESOME ON THE RIGHT HAND SCRUB FIRS THEIR SPIRITS QUITE UNBROKEN BY LONG YEARS OF TUSSLE WITH THE GULF WINDS GREW THICKLY
8012-273137-0038 BEYOND LAY THE SEA SHIMMERING AND BLUE AND OVER IT SOARED THE GULLS THEIR PINIONS FLASHING SILVERY IN THE SUNLIGHT ISN'T THE SEA WONDERFUL SAID ANNE ROUSING FROM A LONG WIDE EYED SILENCE ONCE WHEN I LIVED IN MARYSVILLE
8012-273137-0039 I ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THAT DAY EVEN IF I HAD TO LOOK AFTER THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME
