4010-10801-0000 THEY BOTH ALONG WITH SAINT LUKE TELL US OF A CRY WITH A LOUD VOICE AND THE GIVING UP OF THE GHOST BETWEEN WHICH CRY AND THE GIVING UP SAINT LUKE RECORDS THE WORDS FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT
4010-10801-0001 HE TELLS US ONLY THAT AFTER JESUS HAD RECEIVED THE VINEGAR HE SAID IT IS FINISHED AND BOWED HIS HEAD AND GAVE UP THE GHOST WILL THE LORD EVER TELL US WHY HE CRIED SO
4010-10801-0002 WAS IT THE CRY OF RELIEF AT THE TOUCH OF DEATH WAS IT THE CRY OF VICTORY WAS IT THE CRY OF GLADNESS THAT HE HAD ENDURED TO THE END OR DID THE FATHER LOOK OUT UPON HIM IN ANSWER TO HIS MY GOD
4010-10801-0003 AND THE BLESSEDNESS OF IT MAKE HIM CRY ALOUD BECAUSE HE COULD NOT SMILE WAS SUCH HIS CONDITION NOW THAT THE GREATEST GLADNESS OF THE UNIVERSE COULD EXPRESS ITSELF ONLY IN A LOUD CRY OR WAS IT BUT THE LAST WRENCH OF PAIN
4010-10801-0004 ERE THE FINAL REPOSE BEGAN IT MAY HAVE BEEN ALL IN ONE BUT NEVER SURELY IN ALL BOOKS IN ALL WORDS OF THINKING MEN
4010-10801-0005 CAN THERE BE SO MUCH EXPRESSED AS LAY UNARTICULATED IN THAT CRY OF THE SON OF GOD NOW HAD HE MADE HIS FATHER LORD NO LONGER IN THE MIGHT OF MAKING AND LOVING ALONE BUT LORD IN RIGHT OF DEVOTION AND DEED OF LOVE
4010-10801-0006 NOW SHOULD INWARD SONSHIP AND THE SPIRIT OF GLAD SACRIFICE BE BORN IN THE HEARTS OF MEN FOR THE DIVINE OBEDIENCE WAS PERFECTED BY SUFFERING HE HAD BEEN AMONGST HIS BRETHREN WHAT HE WOULD HAVE HIS BRETHREN BE
4010-10801-0007 HIS VERY LIFE BEING HIS ESSENCE OF EXISTENCE WHAT BEST HE LOVED WHAT BEST HE WAS HE HAD BEEN AMONG THEM THEIR GOD BROTHER AND THE MIGHTY STORY ENDS WITH A CRY
4010-10801-0008 THEN THE CRY MEANT IT IS FINISHED THE CRY MEANT FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT EVERY HIGHEST HUMAN ACT IS JUST A GIVING BACK TO GOD
4010-10801-0009 OF THAT WHICH HE FIRST GAVE TO US THOU GOD HAST GIVEN ME HERE AGAIN IS THY GIFT I SEND MY SPIRIT HOME EVERY ACT OF WORSHIP IS A HOLDING UP TO GOD OF WHAT GOD HATH MADE US HERE LORD
4010-10801-0010 LOOK WHAT I HAVE GOT FEEL WITH ME IN WHAT THOU HAST MADE ME IN THIS THY OWN BOUNTY MY BEING I AM THY CHILD AND KNOW NOT HOW TO THANK THEE SAVE BY UPLIFTING THE HEAVE OFFERING OF THE OVERFLOWING OF THY LIFE
4010-10801-0011 AND CALLING ALOUD IT IS THINE IT IS MINE I AM THINE AND THEREFORE I AM MINE THE VAST OPERATIONS OF THE SPIRITUAL AS OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD ARE SIMPLY A TURNING AGAIN TO THE SOURCE
4010-10801-0012 THE LAST ACT OF OUR LORD IN THUS COMMENDING HIS SPIRIT AT THE CLOSE OF HIS LIFE WAS ONLY A SUMMING UP OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD BEEN OFFERING THIS SACRIFICE THE SACRIFICE OF HIMSELF
4010-10801-0013 ALL THE YEARS AND IN THUS SACRIFICING HE HAD LIVED THE DIVINE LIFE EVERY MORNING WHEN HE WENT OUT ERE IT WAS DAY EVERY EVENING WHEN HE LINGERED ON THE NIGHT LAPT MOUNTAIN AFTER HIS FRIENDS WERE GONE
4010-10801-0014 HE WAS OFFERING HIMSELF TO HIS FATHER IN THE COMMUNION OF LOVING WORDS OF HIGH THOUGHTS OF SPEECHLESS FEELINGS AND BETWEEN HE TURNED TO DO THE SAME THING IN DEED NAMELY IN LOVING WORD
4010-10801-0015 IN HELPING THOUGHT IN HEALING ACTION TOWARDS HIS FELLOWS FOR THE WAY TO WORSHIP GOD WHILE THE DAYLIGHT LASTS IS TO WORK THE SERVICE OF GOD THE ONLY DIVINE SERVICE
4010-10801-0016 IS THE HELPING OF OUR FELLOWS I DO NOT SEEK TO POINT OUT THIS COMMENDING OF OUR SPIRITS TO THE FATHER AS A DUTY THAT IS TO TURN THE HIGHEST PRIVILEGE WE POSSESS INTO A BURDEN GRIEVOUS TO BE BORNE
4010-10801-0017 FOR THE HUMAN BEING MAY SAY THUS WITH HIMSELF AM I GOING TO SLEEP TO LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS TO BE HELPLESS FOR A TIME THOUGHTLESS DEAD OR MORE AWFUL CONSIDERATION IN THE DREAMS THAT MAY COME
4010-10801-0018 MAY I NOT BE WEAK OF WILL AND SCANT OF CONSCIENCE FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT I GIVE MYSELF BACK TO THEE TAKE ME SOOTHE ME REFRESH ME MAKE ME OVER AGAIN
4010-10801-0019 AM I GOING OUT INTO THE BUSINESS AND TURMOIL OF THE DAY WHERE SO MANY TEMPTATIONS MAY COME TO DO LESS HONOURABLY LESS FAITHFULLY LESS KINDLY LESS DILIGENTLY THAN THE IDEAL MAN WOULD HAVE ME DO FATHER
4010-10801-0020 TO REFUSE A FRIEND'S REQUEST TO URGE A NEIGHBOUR'S CONSCIENCE FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT AM I IN PAIN IS ILLNESS COMING UPON ME TO SHUT OUT THE GLAD VISIONS OF A HEALTHY BRAIN
4010-10801-0021 AND BRING ME SUCH AS ARE TROUBLED AND UNTRUE TAKE MY SPIRIT LORD AND SEE AS THOU ART WONT THAT IT HAS NO MORE TO BEAR THAN IT CAN BEAR AM I GOING TO DIE THOU KNOWEST
4010-10801-0022 FOR OF THE THOUSANDS WHO PASS THROUGH IT EVERY DAY NOT ONE ENLIGHTENS HIS NEIGHBOUR LEFT BEHIND BUT SHALL I NOT LONG WITH AGONY FOR ONE BREATH OF THY AIR AND NOT RECEIVE IT
4010-10801-0023 SHALL I NOT BE TORN ASUNDER WITH DYING I WILL QUESTION NO MORE FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT FOR IT IS THY BUSINESS NOT MINE
4010-10801-0024 IF THY LOVE WHICH IS BETTER THAN LIFE RECEIVE IT THEN SURELY THY TENDERNESS WILL MAKE IT GREAT THUS MAY THE HUMAN BEING SAY WITH HIMSELF THINK BROTHERS THINK
4010-10801-0025 SISTERS WE WALK IN THE AIR OF AN ETERNAL FATHERHOOD EVERY UPLIFTING OF THE HEART IS A LOOKING UP TO THE FATHER GRACIOUSNESS AND TRUTH ARE AROUND ABOVE
4010-10801-0026 BENEATH US YEA IN US WHEN WE ARE LEAST WORTHY THEN MOST TEMPTED HARDEST UNKINDEST LET US YET COMMEND OUR SPIRITS INTO HIS HANDS
4010-10801-0027 AND SHALL WE DARE TO THINK GOD WOULD SEND US AWAY IF WE CAME THUS AND WOULD NOT BE PLEASED THAT WE CAME EVEN IF WE WERE ANGRY AS JONAH WOULD WE NOT LET ALL THE TENDERNESS OF OUR NATURE FLOW FORTH UPON SUCH A CHILD
4010-10801-0028 AND SHALL WE DARE TO THINK THAT IF WE BEING EVIL KNOW HOW TO GIVE GOOD GIFTS TO OUR CHILDREN GOD WILL NOT GIVE US HIS OWN SPIRIT WHEN WE COME TO ASK HIM
4010-10801-0029 SOME GENIAL RAIN DROP ON THE DRY SELFISHNESS SOME GLANCE OF SUNLIGHT ON THE CLOUDY HOPELESSNESS BREAD AT LEAST WILL BE GIVEN AND NOT A STONE WATER AT LEAST WILL BE SURE AND NOT VINEGAR MINGLED WITH GALL
4010-10801-0030 NOR IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN ASK FOR OURSELVES THAT WE MAY NOT ASK FOR ANOTHER WE MAY COMMEND ANY BROTHER ANY SISTER TO THE COMMON FATHERHOOD AND THERE WILL BE MOMENTS WHEN FILLED WITH THAT SPIRIT WHICH IS THE LORD
4010-10801-0031 NOTHING WILL EASE OUR HEARTS OF THEIR LOVE BUT THE COMMENDING OF ALL MEN ALL OUR BROTHERS ALL OUR SISTERS TO THE ONE FATHER NOR SHALL WE EVER KNOW THAT REPOSE IN THE FATHER'S HANDS
4010-10801-0032 THAT REST OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE WHICH THE LORD KNEW WHEN THE AGONY OF DEATH WAS OVER WHEN THE STORM OF THE WORLD DIED AWAY BEHIND HIS RETIRING SPIRIT AND HE ENTERED THE REGIONS WHERE THERE IS ONLY LIFE AND THEREFORE ALL THAT IS NOT MUSIC IS SILENCE
