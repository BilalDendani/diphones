2046-141204-0000 AND THEN NORTHERLY THROUGH SEVERAL LAKES NOW UNDER THE NAMES OF THE CHAMBEZI THEN AS THE LUAPULA AND THEN AS THE LUALABA AND THAT IT STILL CONTINUED ITS FLOW TOWARDS THE NORTH FOR OVER SEVEN DEGREES LIVINGSTONE BECAME FIRMLY OF THE OPINION THAT THE RIVER WHOSE CURRENT HE FOLLOWED WAS THE EGYPTIAN NILE
2046-141204-0001 SICK TOILINGS AND DIFFICULTIES TO ALL ENTREATIES TO COME HOME TO ALL THE GLOWING TEMPTATIONS WHICH HOME AND INNUMERABLE FRIENDS OFFER HE RETURNS THE DETERMINED ANSWER NO
2046-141204-0002 AND THAT IS HIS ABILITY TO WITHSTAND THE DREADFUL CLIMATE OF CENTRAL AFRICA AND THE CONSISTENT ENERGY WITH WHICH HE FOLLOWS UP HIS EXPLORATIONS HIS CONSISTENT ENERGY IS NATIVE TO HIM AND TO HIS RACE
2046-141204-0003 HE IS A VERY FINE EXAMPLE OF THE PERSEVERANCE DOGGEDNESS AND TENACITY WHICH CHARACTERISE THE ANGLO SAXON SPIRIT
2046-141204-0004 THE SECOND DAY AFTER MY ARRIVAL IN UJIJI I ASKED THE DOCTOR IF HE DID NOT FEEL A DESIRE SOMETIMES TO VISIT HIS COUNTRY
2046-141204-0005 IT ONLY REQUIRES SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS MORE TO TRACE THE TRUE SOURCE THAT I HAVE DISCOVERED WITH PETHERICK'S BRANCH OF THE WHITE NILE OR WITH THE ALBERT N'YANZA OF SIR SAMUEL BAKER WHICH IS THE LAKE CALLED BY THE NATIVES
2046-141204-0006 AND WHY I ASKED DID YOU COME SO FAR BACK WITHOUT FINISHING THE TASK WHICH YOU SAY YOU HAVE GOT TO DO SIMPLY BECAUSE I WAS FORCED MY MEN WOULD NOT BUDGE A STEP FORWARD THEY MUTINIED AND FORMED A SECRET RESOLUTION
2046-141204-0007 IF I STILL INSISTED UPON GOING ON TO RAISE A DISTURBANCE IN THE COUNTRY AND AFTER THEY HAD EFFECTED IT TO ABANDON ME IN WHICH CASE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IT WAS DANGEROUS TO GO ANY FURTHER I HAD EXPLORED SIX HUNDRED MILES OF THE WATERSHED HAD TRACED ALL THE PRINCIPAL STREAMS
2046-141204-0008 WHICH DISCHARGE THEIR WATERS INTO THE CENTRAL LINE OF DRAINAGE BUT WHEN ABOUT STARTING TO EXPLORE THE LAST HUNDRED MILES THE HEARTS OF MY PEOPLE FAILED THEM AND THEY SET ABOUT FRUSTRATING ME IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY NOW HAVING RETURNED SEVEN HUNDRED MILES TO GET A NEW SUPPLY OF STORES
2046-141204-0009 AND ANOTHER ESCORT I FIND MYSELF DESTITUTE OF EVEN THE MEANS TO LIVE BUT FOR A FEW WEEKS AND SICK IN MIND AND BODY HERE I MAY PAUSE TO ASK ANY BRAVE MAN HOW HE WOULD HAVE COMPORTED HIMSELF IN SUCH A CRISIS
2046-141204-0010 MANY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN EXCEEDING HURRY TO GET HOME TO TELL THE NEWS OF THE CONTINUED EXPLORATIONS AND DISCOVERIES
2046-141204-0011 ENOUGH SURELY HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED TOWARDS THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM THAT HAD EXERCISED THE MINDS OF HIS SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATES OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPICAL SOCIETY IT WAS NO NEGATIVE EXPLORATION IT WAS HARD EARNEST LABOR OF YEARS
2046-141204-0012 SELF ABNEGATION ENDURING PATIENCE AND EXALTED FORTITUDE SUCH AS ORDINARY MEN FAIL TO EXHIBIT
2046-141204-0013 TO TELL THE NEWS TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL WORLD THEN HAD RETURNED TO DISCOVER MOERO AND RUN AWAY AGAIN THEN WENT BACK ONCE MORE ONLY TO DISCOVER KAMOLONDO AND TO RACE BACK AGAIN THIS WOULD NOT BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH LIVINGSTONE'S CHARACTER
2046-141204-0014 HE MUST NOT ONLY DISCOVER THE CHAMBEZI LAKE BANGWEOLO LUAPULA RIVER LAKE MOERO LUALABA RIVER AND LAKE KAMOLONDO
2046-141204-0015 HAD HE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF ORDINARY EXPLORERS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN RUNNING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO TELL THE NEWS INSTEAD OF EXPLORING
2046-141204-0016 THEY ARE NO FEW MONTHS EXPLORATIONS THAT FORM THE CONTENTS OF HIS BOOKS HIS MISSIONARY TRAVELS EMBRACES A PERIOD OF SIXTEEN YEARS
2046-141204-0017 FIVE YEARS AND IF THE GREAT TRAVELLER LIVES TO COME HOME HIS THIRD BOOK THE GRANDEST OF ALL MUST CONTAIN THE RECORDS OF EIGHT OR NINE YEARS IT IS A PRINCIPLE WITH LIVINGSTONE TO DO WELL WHAT HE UNDERTAKES TO DO AND IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE IS DOING IT DESPITE THE YEARNING FOR HIS HOME
2046-141204-0018 WHICH IS SOMETIMES OVERPOWERING HE FINDS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT CONTENTMENT IF NOT HAPPINESS TO MEN DIFFERENTLY CONSTITUTED
2046-141204-0019 YET LIVINGSTONE'S MIND CAN FIND PLEASURE AND FOOD FOR PHILOSOPHIC STUDIES THE WONDERS OF PRIMEVAL NATURE THE GREAT FORESTS AND SUBLIME MOUNTAINS THE PERENNIAL STREAMS AND SOURCES OF THE GREAT LAKES THE MARVELS OF THE EARTH
2046-141204-0020 THE SPLENDORS OF THE TROPIC SKY BY DAY AND BY NIGHT ALL TERRESTRIAL AND CELESTIAL PHENOMENA ARE MANNA TO A MAN OF SUCH SELF ABNEGATION AND DEVOTED PHILANTHROPIC SPIRIT HE CAN BE CHARMED WITH THE PRIMITIVE SIMPLICITY OF
2046-141204-0021 ETHIOP'S DUSKY CHILDREN WITH WHOM HE HAS SPENT SO MANY YEARS OF HIS LIFE HE HAS A STURDY FAITH IN THEIR CAPABILITIES SEES VIRTUE IN THEM WHERE OTHERS SEE NOTHING BUT SAVAGERY
2046-141204-0022 AND WHEREVER HE HAS GONE AMONG THEM HE HAS SOUGHT TO ELEVATE A PEOPLE THAT WERE APPARENTLY FORGOTTEN OF GOD AND CHRISTIAN MAN ONE NIGHT I TOOK OUT MY NOTE BOOK AND PREPARED TO TAKE DOWN FROM HIS OWN LIPS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HIS TRAVELS AND UNHESITATINGLY
2046-141204-0023 HE RELATED HIS EXPERIENCES OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY DOCTOR DAVID LIVINGSTONE LEFT THE ISLAND OF ZANZIBAR IN MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX ON THE SEVENTH OF THE FOLLOWING MONTH HE DEPARTED FROM
2046-141204-0024 FOR THE INTERIOR WITH AN EXPEDITION CONSISTING OF TWELVE SEPOYS FROM BOMBAY NINE MEN FROM JOHANNA
2046-141204-0025 TAKING THEM AS AN EXPERIMENT SIX CAMELS THREE BUFFALOES TWO MULES AND THREE DONKEYS HE HAD THUS THIRTY MEN WITH HIM TWELVE OF WHOM VIZ THE SEPOYS WERE TO ACT AS GUARDS FOR THE EXPEDITION
2046-141204-0026 THEY WERE MOSTLY ARMED WITH THE ENFIELD RIFLES PRESENTED TO THE DOCTOR BY THE BOMBAY GOVERNMENT THE BAGGAGE OF THE EXPEDITION CONSISTED OF TEN BALES OF CLOTH AND TWO BAGS OF BEADS
2046-141204-0027 WHICH WERE TO SERVE AS THE CURRENCY BY WHICH THEY WOULD BE ENABLED TO PURCHASE THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE IN THE COUNTRIES THE DOCTOR INTENDED TO VISIT BESIDES THE CUMBROUS MONEYS THEY CARRIED SEVERAL BOXES OF INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS CHRONOMETERS AIR THERMOMETERS SEXTANT AND ARTIFICIAL HORIZON
2046-141204-0028 BOXES CONTAINING CLOTHES MEDICINES AND PERSONAL NECESSARIES THE EXPEDITION TRAVELLED UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE ROVUMA RIVER A ROUTE
2046-141204-0029 FOR MILES LIVINGSTONE AND HIS PARTY HAD TO CUT THEIR WAY WITH THEIR AXES THROUGH THE DENSE AND ALMOST IMPENETRABLE JUNGLES WHICH LINED THE RIVER'S BANKS THE ROAD WAS A MERE FOOTPATH LEADING IN THE MOST ERRATIC FASHION INTO AND THROUGH THE DENSE VEGETATION
2046-141204-0030 SEEKING THE EASIEST OUTLET FROM IT WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THE COURSE IT RAN
2046-141204-0031 WERE ABLE TO PROCEED EASILY ENOUGH BUT THE CAMELS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR ENORMOUS HEIGHT COULD NOT ADVANCE A STEP WITHOUT THE AXES OF THE PARTY CLEARING THE WAY THESE TOOLS OF FORESTERS WERE ALMOST ALWAYS REQUIRED
2046-141204-0032 BUT THE ADVANCE OF THE EXPEDITION WAS OFTEN RETARDED BY THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE SEPOYS AND JOHANNA MEN TO WORK SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE EXPEDITION FROM THE COAST
2046-141204-0033 THE MURMURINGS AND COMPLAINTS OF THESE MEN BEGAN AND UPON EVERY OCCASION AND AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY THEY EVINCED A DECIDED HOSTILITY TO AN ADVANCE IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE PROGRESS OF THE DOCTOR AND IN HOPES THAT IT WOULD COMPEL HIM TO RETURN TO THE COAST THESE
2046-141204-0034 MEN SO CRUELLY TREATED THE ANIMALS THAT BEFORE LONG THERE WAS NOT ONE LEFT ALIVE BUT AS THIS SCHEME FAILED THEY SET ABOUT INSTIGATING THE NATIVES AGAINST THE WHITE MEN WHOM THEY ACCUSED MOST WANTONLY OF STRANGE PRACTICES
2046-141204-0035 AS THIS PLAN WAS MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED AND AS IT WAS DANGEROUS TO HAVE SUCH MEN WITH HIM THE DOCTOR ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION
2046-141204-0036 BUT NOT WITHOUT HAVING FIRST FURNISHED THEM WITH THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THE COAST THESE MEN WERE SUCH A DISREPUTABLE SET THAT THE NATIVES SPOKE OF THEM AS THE DOCTOR'S SLAVES ONE OF THEIR WORST SINS WAS THE CUSTOM OF GIVING THEIR GUNS AND AMMUNITION
2046-141204-0037 TO CARRY TO THE FIRST WOMAN OR BOY THEY MET WHOM THEY IMPRESSED FOR THAT PURPOSE BY SUCH THREATS OR PROMISES AS THEY WERE TOTALLY UNABLE TO PERFORM AND UNWARRANTED IN MAKING AN HOUR'S MARCHING WAS SUFFICIENT TO FATIGUE THEM
2046-141204-0038 AFTER WHICH THEY LAY DOWN ON THE ROAD TO BEWAIL THEIR HARD FATE AND CONCOCT NEW SCHEMES TO FRUSTRATE THEIR LEADER'S PURPOSES TOWARDS NIGHT THEY GENERALLY MADE THEIR APPEARANCE AT THE CAMPING GROUND WITH THE LOOKS OF HALF DEAD MEN
2046-141204-0039 SUCH MEN NATURALLY MADE BUT A POOR ESCORT FOR HAD THE PARTY BEEN ATTACKED BY A WANDERING TRIBE OF NATIVES OF ANY STRENGTH THE DOCTOR COULD HAVE MADE NO DEFENCE AND NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT TO HIM BUT TO SURRENDER AND BE RUINED
2046-141204-0040 THE DOCTOR AND HIS LITTLE PARTY ARRIVED ON THE EIGHTEENTH JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX AT A VILLAGE BELONGING TO A CHIEF OF THE WAHIYOU
2046-141204-0041 THE TERRITORY LYING BETWEEN THE ROVUMA RIVER AND THIS WAHIYOU VILLAGE WAS AN UNINHABITED WILDERNESS DURING THE TRANSIT OF WHICH LIVINGSTONE AND HIS EXPEDITION SUFFERED CONSIDERABLY FROM HUNGER AND DESERTION OF MEN EARLY IN AUGUST EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX THE DOCTOR CAME TO THE COUNTRY OF MPONDA
2046-141204-0042 ON THE ROAD THITHER TWO OF THE LIBERATED SLAVES DESERTED HIM HERE ALSO WEKOTANI A PROTEGE OF THE DOCTOR INSISTED UPON HIS DISCHARGE
2046-141204-0043 THAT HE HAD FOUND HIS BROTHER HE ALSO STATED THAT HIS FAMILY LIVED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE NYASSA LAKE
2046-141204-0044 PERCEIVING THAT WEKOTANI WAS UNWILLING TO GO WITH HIM FURTHER THE DOCTOR TOOK HIM TO MPONDA WHO NOW SAW AND HEARD OF HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME AND HAVING FURNISHED THE UNGRATEFUL BOY WITH ENOUGH CLOTH AND BEADS TO KEEP HIM UNTIL HIS BIG BROTHER SHOULD CALL FOR HIM LEFT HIM WITH THE CHIEF
2046-141204-0045 AFTER FIRST ASSURING HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD RECEIVE HONOURABLE TREATMENT FROM HIM THE DOCTOR ALSO GAVE WEKOTANTI WRITING PAPER AS
2046-141204-0046 WHERE HE HAD BEEN PUT TO SCHOOL SO THAT SHOULD HE AT ANY TIME FEEL DISPOSED
2046-141204-0047 THE DOCTOR FURTHER ENJOINED HIM NOT TO JOIN IN ANY OF THE SLAVE RAIDS USUALLY MADE BY HIS COUNTRYMEN THE MEN OF NYASSA ON THEIR NEIGHBOURS UPON FINDING THAT HIS APPLICATION FOR A DISCHARGE WAS SUCCESSFUL
2046-141204-0048 WEKOTANI ENDEAVOURED TO INDUCE CHUMAH ANOTHER PROTEGE OF THE DOCTOR'S AND A COMPANION OR CHUM OF WEKOTANI TO LEAVE THE DOCTOR'S SERVICE AND PROCEED WITH HIM PROMISING AS A BRIBE A WIFE AND PLENTY OF POMBE FROM HIS BIG BROTHER
2046-141204-0049 CHUMAH UPON REFERRING THE MATTER TO THE DOCTOR WAS ADVISED NOT TO GO AS HE THE DOCTOR STRONGLY SUSPECTED THAT WEKOTANI WANTED ONLY TO MAKE HIM HIS SLAVE CHUMAH WISELY WITHDREW FROM HIS TEMPTER FROM MPONDA'S THE DOCTOR PROCEEDED TO THE HEEL OF THE NYASSA
2046-141204-0050 WITH HIS USUAL KINDNESS HE STAYED AT THIS CHIEF'S VILLAGE TO TREAT HIS MALADY
2046-141204-0051 MUSA HOWEVER FOR HIS OWN REASONS WHICH WILL APPEAR PRESENTLY EAGERLY LISTENED TO THE ARAB'S TALE AND GAVE FULL CREDENCE TO IT HAVING WELL DIGESTED ITS HORRIBLE DETAILS HE CAME TO THE DOCTOR TO GIVE HIM THE FULL BENEFIT OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD WITH SUCH WILLING EARS
2046-141204-0052 THE TRAVELLER PATIENTLY LISTENED TO THE NARRATIVE WHICH LOST NOTHING OF ITS PORTENTOUS SIGNIFICANCE THROUGH MUSA'S RELATION
2046-141204-0053 YES ANSWERED MUSA READILY HE TELL ME TRUE TRUE I ASK HIM GOOD AND HE TELL ME TRUE TRUE
2046-141204-0054 THEY WOULD HAVE MURDERED HIM BUT SUGGESTED IN ORDER TO ALLAY THE FEARS OF HIS MOSLEM SUBORDINATE THAT THEY SHOULD BOTH PROCEED TO THE CHIEF WITH WHOM THEY WERE STAYING WHO BEING A SENSIBLE MAN WOULD BE ABLE TO ADVISE THEM AS TO THE PROBABILITY OR IMPROBABILITY OF THE TALE BEING CORRECT TOGETHER THEY PROCEEDED TO THE BABISA CHIEF
2046-141204-0055 WHO WHEN HE HAD HEARD THE ARAB'S STORY UNHESITATINGLY DENOUNCED THE ARAB AS A LIAR AND HIS STORY WITHOUT THE LEAST FOUNDATION IN FACT GIVING AS A REASON THAT IF THE MAZITU HAD BEEN LATELY IN THAT VICINITY
2046-141204-0056 BUT MUSA BROKE OUT WITH NO NO DOCTOR NO NO NO I NO WANT TO GO TO MAZITU I NO WANT MAZITU TO KILL ME I WANT TO SEE MY FATHER MY MOTHER MY CHILD IN JOHANNA I WANT NO MAZITU THESE ARE MUSA'S WORDS
2046-141204-0057 IPSISSIMA VERBA TO WHICH THE DOCTOR REPLIED I DON'T WANT THE MAZITU TO KILL ME EITHER BUT AS YOU ARE AFRAID OF THEM I PROMISE TO GO STRAIGHT WEST UNTIL WE GET FAR PAST THE BEAT OF THE MAZITU MUSA WAS NOT SATISFIED BUT KEPT MOANING AND SORROWING SAYING
2046-141204-0058 IF WE HAD TWO HUNDRED GUNS WITH US I WOULD GO BUT OUR SMALL PARTY OF MEN THEY WILL ATTACK BY NIGHT AND KILL ALL THE DOCTOR REPEATED HIS PROMISE BUT I WILL NOT GO NEAR THEM I WILL GO WEST AS SOON AS HE TURNED HIS FACE WESTWARD MUSA AND THE JOHANNA MEN RAN AWAY IN A BODY
2046-141204-0059 THE DOCTOR SAYS IN COMMENTING UPON MUSA'S CONDUCT THAT HE FELT STRONGLY TEMPTED TO SHOOT MUSA AND ANOTHER RINGLEADER BUT WAS NEVERTHELESS GLAD THAT HE DID NOT SOIL HIS HANDS WITH THEIR VILE BLOOD A DAY OR TWO AFTERWARDS ANOTHER OF HIS MEN SIMON PRICE BY NAME
2046-141204-0060 BUT COMPELLED BY THE SCANT NUMBER OF HIS PEOPLE TO REPRESS ALL SUCH TENDENCIES TO DESERTION AND FAINT HEARTEDNESS THE DOCTOR SILENCED HIM AT ONCE AND STERNLY FORBADE HIM TO UTTER THE NAME OF THE MAZITU ANY MORE HAD THE NATIVES NOT ASSISTED HIM
2046-141204-0061 FORTUNATELY AS THE DOCTOR SAYS WITH UNCTION I WAS IN A COUNTRY NOW AFTER LEAVING THE SHORES OF NYASSA WHICH THE FOOT OF THE SLAVE TRADER HAS NOT TROD IT WAS A NEW AND VIRGIN LAND AND OF COURSE AS I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND IN SUCH CASES THE NATIVES WERE REALLY GOOD AND HOSPITABLE
2046-141204-0062 IN MANY OTHER WAYS THE TRAVELLER IN HIS EXTREMITY WAS KINDLY TREATED BY THE YET UNSOPHISTICATED AND INNOCENT NATIVES ON LEAVING THIS HOSPITABLE REGION IN THE EARLY PART OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
2046-141204-0063 THE DOCTOR ENTERED A COUNTRY WHERE THE MAZITU HAD EXERCISED THEIR CUSTOMARY MARAUDING PROPENSITIES THE LAND WAS SWEPT CLEAN OF PROVISIONS AND CATTLE
2046-141204-0064 THEY HAD RECOURSE TO THE WILD FRUITS WHICH SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FURNISHED AT INTERVALS THE CONDITION OF THE HARD PRESSED BAND WAS MADE WORSE BY THE HEARTLESS DESERTION OF SOME OF ITS MEMBERS
2046-141204-0065 THE PORTUGUESE TRAVELLER CAZEMBE IS A MOST INTELLIGENT PRINCE HE IS A TALL STALWART MAN WHO WEARS A PECULIAR KIND OF DRESS MADE OF CRIMSON PRINT IN THE FORM OF A PRODIGIOUS KILT
2046-141204-0066 SURROUNDED BY HIS CHIEFS AND BODY GUARDS A CHIEF WHO HAD BEEN DEPUTED BY THE KING AND ELDERS TO DISCOVER ALL ABOUT THE WHITE MAN
2046-141204-0067 HE HAD HEARD THAT THE WHITE MAN HAD COME TO LOOK FOR WATERS FOR RIVERS AND SEAS THOUGH HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHITE MAN COULD WANT WITH SUCH THINGS HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE OBJECT WAS GOOD
2046-141204-0068 AND WHERE HE THOUGHT OF GOING THE DOCTOR REPLIED THAT HE HAD THOUGHT OF PROCEEDING SOUTH AS HE HAD HEARD OF LAKES AND RIVERS BEING IN THAT DIRECTION
2046-141204-0069 THERE IS PLENTY OF LARGE WATER IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
2046-141204-0070 THROUGH HIS COUNTRY UNDISTURBED AND UNMOLESTED HE WAS THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN HE HAD SEEN HE SAID AND HE LIKED HIM SHORTLY AFTER HIS INTRODUCTION TO THE KING THE QUEEN ENTERED THE LARGE HOUSE SURROUNDED BY A BODY GUARD OF AMAZONS WITH SPEARS
2046-141204-0071 SHE WAS A FINE TALL HANDSOME YOUNG WOMAN AND EVIDENTLY THOUGHT SHE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION UPON THE RUSTIC WHITE MAN
2046-141204-0072 AND WAS ARMED WITH A PONDEROUS SPEAR BUT HER APPEARANCE SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE DOCTOR HAD IMAGINED CAUSED HIM TO LAUGH WHICH ENTIRELY SPOILED THE EFFECT INTENDED FOR THE LAUGH OF THE DOCTOR WAS SO CONTAGIOUS THAT SHE HERSELF WAS THE FIRST TO IMITATE IT
2046-141204-0073 AND THE AMAZONS COURTIER LIKE FOLLOWED SUIT
2046-141204-0074 BUT LIVINGSTONE WILL HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HIS RECEPTION AT THIS COURT
2046-141204-0075 SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN THE COUNTRY OF LUNDA OR LONDA
2046-141204-0076 WHICH WAS QUITE AN IMPORTANT STREAM THE SIMILARITY OF THE NAME WITH THAT LARGE AND NOBLE RIVER SOUTH WHICH WILL BE FOR EVER CONNECTED WITH HIS NAME MISLED LIVINGSTONE AT THAT TIME AND HE ACCORDINGLY DID NOT PAY TO IT THE ATTENTION IT DESERVED
2046-141204-0077 AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD NO BEARING OR CONNECTION WITH THE SOURCES OF THE RIVER OF EGYPT OF WHICH HE WAS IN SEARCH
