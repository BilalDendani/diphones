6643-67857-0009 TWENTY DOLLARS WAS A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY SHE REFLECTED IF THE NORTHERN SOLDIERS WOULD ONLY COME QUICKLY AND SET THE SLAVES FREE BUT EVEN IF THEY DID NOT COME FOR A LONG TIME THE MONEY WOULD SURELY PAY MISTER WAITE WAGES FOR ESTRALLA SO THAT HE WOULD NOT INSIST ON SELLING HER
6643-67857-0010 ESTRALLA'S FACE HAD BRIGHTENED INSTANTLY AT SYLVIA'S PROMISE AND WHEN SYLVIA EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD MONEY OF HER VERY OWN AND EVEN OPENED HER WRITING DESK AND SHOWED ESTRALLA THE SHINING GOLD PIECES THE LITTLE DARKY'S FEARS VANISHED

6643-67857-0015 I'LL ASK THEM RIGHT AWAY AFTER BREAKFAST BEFORE THEY START FOR SCHOOL SYLVIA PROMISED EAGERLY
6643-67857-0016 ESPECIALLY AS HER MOTHER HAD DECIDED THAT LESSONS WOULD NOT BEGIN UNTIL THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT HAD SEEMED TO MISSUS FULTON THAT HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS TIRED AND NOT AS WELL AS USUAL AND SHE WAS GLAD THAT THE SAILING EXPEDITION WOULD TAKE HER OUT FOR A LONG AFTERNOON ON THE WATER
6643-67857-0017 SYLVIA ATE HER BREAKFAST HURRIEDLY AND RAN UPSTAIRS FOR HER CAPE AND HAT

6643-67857-0021 MISSUS FULTON SAW SYLVIA CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY ESTRALLA RUNNING ACROSS THE GARDEN TOWARD THE HOUSE WHERE GRACE WAITE LIVED POOR LITTLE DARKY WHAT WILL SHE DO WHEN SYLVIA GOES NORTH SHE THOUGHT
6643-67857-0022 FOR MISTER FULTON HAD TOLD HER THAT VERY MORNING THAT HE WAS SURE SOUTH CAROLINA WOULD SECEDE FROM THE UNION AND THEN NORTHERN MEN WOULD NO LONGER BE WELCOME IN CHARLESTON THAT MEANT OF COURSE THAT THE FULTONS WOULD HAVE TO RETURN TO BOSTON IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE
6643-67857-0023 BUT ALL COMMUNICATION WITH NORTHERN STATES MIGHT BE PREVENTED IT WAS NO WONDER THAT MISTER AND MISSUS FULTON WERE ANXIOUS AND WORRIED
6643-67857-0024 GRACE WAS READY TO START FOR SCHOOL WHEN SYLVIA AND ESTRALLA ARRIVED AND HER MOTHER GAVE HER CONSENT AT ONCE FOR HER TO GO SAILING IN THE AFTERNOON THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WILL SOON BE HERE SO A HALF DAY OUT OF SCHOOL WILL NOT MATTER MISSUS WAITE SAID SMILINGLY

6643-67857-0031 BUT THAT PHILIP SHOULD WANT THE PALMETTO FLAG TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE STARS AND STRIPES OVER FORT SUMTER SEEMED A MUCH GREATER MISFORTUNE WHEN HE KNOWS IT STANDS FOR SLAVERY SHE THOUGHT WONDERING IF HE HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN ABOUT DINKIE
6643-67857-0032 I'LL HAVE TO RUN OR I'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL DECLARED GRACE I'LL BE ALL READY WHEN YOU CALL AND WITH A GAY GOOD BYE SHE WAS OFF DOWN THE STREET LEAVING SYLVIA AND ESTRALLA STANDING ALONE NEAR THE HIGH WALL WHICH ENCLOSED THE GARDEN OF THE HAYES HOUSE MASSA ROBERT WAITE
