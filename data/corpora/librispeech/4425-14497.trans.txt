4425-14497-0002 WHAT GIVE A MAN PAINS ACROSS THE HEAD AND SPOTS BEFORE HIS EYES BINKIE SHALL US TAKE SOME LIVER PILLS DICK HAD JUST GONE THROUGH A LIVELY SCENE WITH BESSIE SHE HAD FOR THE FIFTIETH TIME REPROACHED HIM FOR SENDING TORPENHOW AWAY
4425-14497-0003 SHE EXPLAINED HER ENDURING HATRED FOR DICK AND MADE IT CLEAR TO HIM THAT SHE ONLY SAT FOR THE SAKE OF HIS MONEY AND MISTER TORPENHOW'S TEN TIMES A BETTER MAN THAN YOU SHE CONCLUDED HE IS
4425-14497-0004 I SHOULD HAVE STAYED AND MADE LOVE TO YOU THE GIRL SAT WITH HER CHIN ON HER HAND SCOWLING
4425-14497-0005 I'D LIKE TO CATCH YOU IF I WASN'T AFRAID O BEING HUNG I'D KILL YOU THAT'S WHAT I'D DO D'YOU BELIEVE ME DICK SMILED WEARILY IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO LIVE IN THE COMPANY OF A NOTION THAT WILL NOT WORK OUT A FOX TERRIER THAT CANNOT TALK
4425-14497-0006 AND A WOMAN WHO TALKS TOO MUCH HE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED BUT AT THAT MOMENT THERE UNROLLED ITSELF FROM ONE CORNER OF THE STUDIO A VEIL AS IT WERE OF THE FLIMSIEST GAUZE HE RUBBED HIS EYES BUT THE GRAY HAZE WOULD NOT GO
4425-14497-0007 BINKIE WE WILL GO TO A MEDICINE MAN WE CAN'T HAVE OUR EYES INTERFERED WITH FOR BY THESE WE GET OUR BREAD ALSO MUTTON CHOP BONES FOR LITTLE DOGS THE DOCTOR WAS AN AFFABLE LOCAL PRACTITIONER WITH WHITE HAIR
4425-14497-0008 AND HE SAID NOTHING TILL DICK BEGAN TO DESCRIBE THE GRAY FILM IN THE STUDIO WE ALL WANT A LITTLE PATCHING AND REPAIRING FROM TIME TO TIME HE CHIRPED LIKE A SHIP MY DEAR SIR EXACTLY LIKE A SHIP SOMETIMES THE HULL IS OUT OF ORDER
4425-14497-0009 AND WE CONSULT THE SURGEON SOMETIMES THE RIGGING AND THEN I ADVISE SOMETIMES THE ENGINES AND WE GO TO THE BRAIN SPECIALIST SOMETIMES THE LOOK OUT ON THE BRIDGE IS TIRED AND THEN WE SEE AN OCULIST
4425-14497-0010 A LITTLE PATCHING AND REPAIRING FROM TIME TO TIME IS ALL WE WANT AN OCULIST BY ALL MEANS DICK SOUGHT AN OCULIST THE BEST IN LONDON HE WAS CERTAIN THAT THE LOCAL PRACTITIONER DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS TRADE
4425-14497-0011 AND MORE CERTAIN THAT MAISIE WOULD LAUGH AT HIM IF HE WERE FORCED TO WEAR SPECTACLES I'VE NEGLECTED THE WARNINGS OF MY LORD THE STOMACH TOO LONG HENCE THESE SPOTS BEFORE THE EYES BINKIE I CAN SEE AS WELL AS I EVER COULD
4425-14497-0012 AS HE ENTERED THE DARK HALL THAT LED TO THE CONSULTING ROOM A MAN CANNONED AGAINST HIM DICK SAW THE FACE AS IT HURRIED OUT INTO THE STREET THAT'S THE WRITER TYPE HE HAS THE SAME MODELLING OF THE FOREHEAD AS TORP HE LOOKS VERY SICK
4425-14497-0013 PROBABLY HEARD SOMETHING HE DIDN'T LIKE EVEN AS HE THOUGHT A GREAT FEAR CAME UPON DICK A FEAR THAT MADE HIM HOLD HIS BREATH AS HE WALKED INTO THE OCULIST'S WAITING ROOM WITH THE HEAVY CARVED FURNITURE THE DARK GREEN PAPER AND THE SOBER HUED PRINTS ON THE WALL
4425-14497-0014 HE RECOGNISED A REPRODUCTION OF ONE OF HIS OWN SKETCHES MANY PEOPLE WERE WAITING THEIR TURN BEFORE HIM HIS EYE WAS CAUGHT BY A FLAMING RED AND GOLD CHRISTMAS CAROL BOOK LITTLE CHILDREN CAME TO THAT EYE DOCTOR AND THEY NEEDED LARGE TYPE AMUSEMENT
4425-14497-0015 THAT'S IDOLATROUS BAD ART HE SAID DRAWING THE BOOK TOWARDS HIMSELF FROM THE ANATOMY OF THE ANGELS IT HAS BEEN MADE IN GERMANY HE OPENED IN MECHANICALLY AND THERE LEAPED TO HIS EYES A VERSE PRINTED IN RED INK
4425-14497-0016 THE NEXT GOOD JOY THAT MARY HAD IT WAS THE JOY OF THREE TO SEE HER GOOD SON JESUS CHRIST MAKING THE BLIND TO SEE MAKING THE BLIND TO SEE GOOD LORD AND HAPPY WE MAY BE
4425-14497-0017 PRAISE FATHER SON AND HOLY GHOST TO ALL ETERNITY DICK READ AND RE READ THE VERSE TILL HIS TURN CAME AND THE DOCTOR WAS BENDING ABOVE HIM SEATED IN AN ARM CHAIR THE BLAZE OF THE GAS MICROSCOPE IN HIS EYES MADE HIM WINCE
4425-14497-0018 THE DOCTOR'S HAND TOUCHED THE SCAR OF THE SWORD CUT ON DICK'S HEAD AND DICK EXPLAINED BRIEFLY HOW HE HAD COME BY IT WHEN THE FLAME WAS REMOVED DICK SAW THE DOCTOR'S FACE AND THE FEAR CAME UPON HIM AGAIN THE DOCTOR WRAPPED HIMSELF IN A MIST OF WORDS
4425-14497-0019 FRONTAL BONE OPTIC NERVE EXTREME CAUTION AND THE AVOIDANCE OF MENTAL ANXIETY VERDICT HE SAID FAINTLY MY BUSINESS IS PAINTING AND I DAREN'T WASTE TIME WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
4425-14497-0020 AGAIN THE WHIRL OF WORDS BUT THIS TIME THEY CONVEYED A MEANING CAN YOU GIVE ME ANYTHING TO DRINK MANY SENTENCES WERE PRONOUNCED IN THAT DARKENED ROOM AND THE PRISONERS OFTEN NEEDED CHEERING
4425-14497-0021 DICK FOUND A GLASS OF LIQUEUR BRANDY IN HIS HAND AS FAR AS I CAN GATHER HE SAID COUGHING ABOVE THE SPIRIT
4425-14497-0022 OR SOMETHING AND THEREFORE HOPELESS WHAT IS MY TIME LIMIT AVOIDING ALL STRAIN AND WORRY PERHAPS ONE YEAR
4425-14497-0023 I REALLY COULD NOT SAY ONE CANNOT ASCERTAIN THE EXACT AMOUNT OF INJURY INFLICTED BY THE SWORD CUT THE SCAR IS AN OLD ONE AND EXPOSURE TO THE STRONG LIGHT OF THE DESERT DID YOU SAY WITH EXCESSIVE APPLICATION TO FINE WORK
4425-14497-0024 I REALLY COULD NOT SAY I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT IT HAS COME WITHOUT ANY WARNING IF YOU WILL LET ME I'LL SIT HERE FOR A MINUTE AND THEN I'LL GO
4425-14497-0025 WITHOUT ANY WARNING WITHOUT ANY WARNING THANKS DICK WENT INTO THE STREET AND WAS RAPTUROUSLY RECEIVED BY BINKIE WE'VE GOT IT VERY BADLY LITTLE DOG JUST AS BADLY AS WE CAN GET IT
4425-14497-0026 WE'LL GO TO THE PARK TO THINK IT OUT THEY HEADED FOR A CERTAIN TREE THAT DICK KNEW WELL AND THEY SAT DOWN TO THIN BECAUSE HIS LEGS WERE TREMBLING UNDER HIM AND THERE WAS COLD FEAR AT THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH
4425-14497-0027 IT'S AS SUDDEN AS BEING SHOT IT'S THE LIVING DEATH BINKIE WE'RE TO BE SHUT UP IN THE DARK IN ONE YEAR IF WE'RE CAREFUL
4425-14497-0028 NOT THOUGH WE LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED BINKIE WAGGED HIS TAIL JOYOUSLY BINKIE WE MUST THINK LET'S SEE HOW IT FEELS TO BE BLIND DICK SHUT HIS EYES AND FLAMING COMMAS AND CATHERINE WHEELS FLOATED INSIDE THE LIDS
4425-14497-0029 YET WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS THE PARK THE SCOPE OF HIS VISION WAS NOT CONTRACTED HE COULD SEE PERFECTLY UNTIL A PROCESSION OF SLOW WHEELING FIREWORKS DEFILED ACROSS HIS EYEBALLS LITTLE DORGLUMS WE AREN'T AT ALL WELL LET'S GO HOME
4425-14497-0030 IF ONLY TORP WERE BACK NOW BUT TORPENHOW WAS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
4425-14497-0031 HIS LETTERS WERE BRIEF AND FULL OF MYSTERY DICK HAD NEVER ASKED ANYBODY TO HELP HIM IN HIS JOYS OR HIS SORROWS HE ARGUED IN THE LONELINESS OF HIS STUDIO
4425-14497-0032 THAT IF HIS FATE WERE BLINDNESS ALL THE TORPENHOWS IN THE WORLD COULD NOT SAVE HIM I CAN'T CALL HIM OFF HIS TRIP TO SIT DOWN AND SYMPATHISE WITH ME I MUST PULL THROUGH THIS BUSINESS ALONE HE SAID HE WAS LYING ON THE SOFA
4425-14497-0033 EATING HIS MOUSTACHE AND WONDERING WHAT THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT WOULD BE LIKE
4425-14497-0034 A SOLDIER HAD BEEN NEARLY HACKED IN TWO BY A BROAD BLADED ARAB SPEAR FOR ONE INSTANT THE MAN FELT NO PAIN LOOKING DOWN HE SAW THAT HIS LIFE BLOOD WAS GOING FROM HIM THE STUPID BEWILDERMENT ON HIS FACE WAS SO INTENSELY COMIC
4425-14497-0035 THAT BOTH DICK AND TORPENHOW STILL PANTING AND UNSTRUNG FROM A FIGHT FOR LIFE HAD ROARED WITH LAUGHTER IN WHICH THE MAN SEEMED AS IF HE WOULD JOIN BUT AS HIS LIPS PARTED IN A SHEEPISH GRIN THE AGONY OF DEATH CAME UPON HIM
4425-14497-0036 AND HE PITCHED GRUNTING AT THEIR FEET DICK LAUGHED AGAIN REMEMBERING THE HORROR IT SEEMED SO EXACTLY LIKE HIS OWN CASE BUT I HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME ALLOWED ME HE SAID HE PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM QUIETLY AT FIRST BUT AFTERWARDS
4425-14497-0037 WITH THE HURRIED FEET OF FEAR IT WAS AS THOUGH A BLACK SHADOW STOOD AT HIS ELBOW AND URGED HIM TO GO FORWARD AND THERE WERE ONLY WEAVING CIRCLES AND FLOATING PIN DOTS BEFORE HIS EYES WE NEED TO BE CALM BINKIE WE MUST BE CALM
4425-14497-0038 HE TALKED ALOUD FOR THE SAKE OF DISTRACTION THIS ISN'T NICE AT ALL WHAT SHALL WE DO WE MUST DO SOMETHING OUR TIME IS SHORT I SHOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED THAT THIS MORNING BUT NOW THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BINKIE WHERE WAS MOSES WHEN THE LIGHT WENT OUT
4425-14497-0039 BINKIE SMILED FROM EAR TO EAR AS A WELL BRED TERRIER SHOULD BUT MADE NO SUGGESTION WERE THERE BUT WORLD ENOUGH AND TIME THIS COYNESS BINKIE WERE NOT CRIME BUT AT MY BACK I ALWAYS HEAR HE WIPED HIS FOREHEAD
4425-14497-0040 WHICH WAS UNPLEASANTLY DAMP WHAT CAN I DO WHAT CAN I DO I HAVEN'T ANY NOTIONS LEFT AND I CAN'T THINK CONNECTEDLY BUT I MUST DO SOMETHING OR I SHALL GO OFF MY HEAD THE HURRIED WALK RECOMMENCED
4425-14497-0041 DICK STOPPING EVERY NOW AND AGAIN TO DRAG FORTH LONG NEGLECTED CANVASES AND OLD NOTE BOOKS FOR HE TURNED TO HIS WORK BY INSTINCT AS A THING THAT COULD NOT FAIL YOU WON'T DO AND YOU WON'T DO HE SAID AT EACH INSPECTION NO MORE SOLDIERS
4425-14497-0042 I COULDN'T PAINT EM SUDDEN DEATH COMES HOME TOO NEARLY AND THIS IS BATTLE AND MURDER FOR ME THE DAY WAS FAILING AND DICK THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT THE TWILIGHT OF THE BLIND HAD COME UPON HIM UNAWARE ALLAH ALMIGHTY HE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY
4425-14497-0043 AND I WON'T WHINE WHEN MY PUNISHMENT COMES WHAT CAN I DO NOW BEFORE THE LIGHT GOES THERE WAS NO ANSWER DICK WAITED TILL HE COULD REGAIN SOME SORT OF CONTROL OVER HIMSELF HIS HANDS WERE SHAKING AND HE PRIDED HIMSELF ON THEIR STEADINESS
4425-14497-0044 HE COULD FEEL THAT HIS LIPS WERE QUIVERING AND THE SWEAT WAS RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE HE WAS LASHED BY FEAR DRIVEN FORWARD BY THE DESIRE TO GET TO WORK AT ONCE AND ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING
4425-14497-0045 AND MADDENED BY THE REFUSAL OF HIS BRAIN TO DO MORE THAN REPEAT THE NEWS THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO GO BLIND IT'S A HUMILIATING EXHIBITION HE THOUGHT AND I'M GLAD TORP ISN'T HERE TO SEE THE DOCTOR SAID I WAS TO AVOID MENTAL WORRY
4425-14497-0046 THE LITTLE DOG YELPED BECAUSE DICK NEARLY SQUEEZED THE BARK OUT OF HIM THEN HE HEARD THE MAN SPEAKING IN THE TWILIGHT AND DOGLIKE UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS TROUBLE STOOD OFF FROM HIM
4425-14497-0047 NOT QUITE SO GENTLE AS WE COULD WISH BUT WE'LL DISCUSS THAT LATER
4425-14497-0048 ALL THOSE STUDIES OF BESSIE'S HEAD WERE NONSENSE AND THEY NEARLY BROUGHT YOUR MASTER INTO A SCRAPE I HOLD THE NOTION NOW AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL THE MELANCOLIA THAT TRANSCENDS ALL WIT THERE SHALL BE MAISIE IN THAT HEAD BECAUSE I SHALL NEVER GET MAISIE
4425-14497-0049 AND BESS OF COURSE BECAUSE SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT MELANCOLIA THOUGH SHE DOESN'T KNOW SHE KNOWS
4425-14497-0050 THAT'S FOR MYSELF SHALL SHE GIGGLE OR GRIN
4425-14497-0051 UNDERSTAND THE SPEECH AND FEEL A STIR OF FELLOWSHIP IN ALL DISASTROUS FIGHT IN ALL DISASTROUS FIGHT THAT'S BETTER THAN PAINTING THE THING MERELY TO PIQUE MAISIE I CAN DO IT NOW BECAUSE I HAVE IT INSIDE ME
4425-14497-0052 BINKIE I'M GOING TO HOLD YOU UP BY YOUR TAIL YOU'RE AN OMEN COME HERE BINKIE SWUNG HEAD DOWNWARD FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT SPEAKING RATHER LIKE HOLDING A GUINEA PIG BUT YOU'RE A BRAVE LITTLE DOG AND YOU DON'T YELP WHEN YOU'RE HUNG UP IT IS AN OMEN
4425-14497-0053 BINKIE WENT TO HIS OWN CHAIR AND AS OFTEN AS HE LOOKED SAW DICK WALKING UP AND DOWN RUBBING HIS HANDS AND CHUCKLING THAT NIGHT DICK WROTE A LETTER TO MAISIE FULL OF THE TENDEREST REGARD FOR HER HEALTH BUT SAYING VERY LITTLE ABOUT HIS OWN
4425-14497-0054 AND DREAMED OF THE MELANCOLIA TO BE BORN NOT TILL MORNING DID HE REMEMBER THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO HIM IN THE FUTURE HE FELL TO WORK WHISTLING SOFTLY AND WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE CLEAN CLEAR JOY OF CREATION WHICH DOES NOT COME TO MAN TOO OFTEN
4425-14497-0055 LEST HE SHOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF THE EQUAL OF HIS GOD AND SO REFUSE TO DIE AT THE APPOINTED TIME HE FORGOT MAISIE TORPENHOW AND BINKIE AT HIS FEET BUT REMEMBERED TO STIR BESSIE WHO NEEDED VERY LITTLE STIRRING
4425-14497-0056 INTO A TREMENDOUS RAGE THAT HE MIGHT WATCH THE SMOULDERING LIGHTS IN HER EYES HE THREW HIMSELF WITHOUT RESERVATION INTO HIS WORK AND DID NOT THINK OF THE DOOM THAT WAS TO OVERTAKE HIM FOR HE WAS POSSESSED WITH HIS NOTION AND THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HAD NO POWER UPON HIM
4425-14497-0057 YOU'RE PLEASED TO DAY SAID BESSIE DICK WAVED HIS MAHL STICK IN MYSTIC CIRCLES AND WENT TO THE SIDEBOARD FOR A DRINK IN THE EVENING WHEN THE EXALTATION OF THE DAY HAD DIED DOWN HE WENT TO THE SIDEBOARD AGAIN AND AFTER SOME VISITS BECAME CONVINCED
4425-14497-0058 SINCE HE COULD STILL SEE EVERYTHING VERY CLEARLY
4425-14497-0059 AND THAT WHETHER SHE LIKED IT OR NOT SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE THE MOOD PASSED NEXT MORNING BUT THE SIDEBOARD AND ALL UPON IT REMAINED FOR HIS COMFORT AGAIN HE SET TO WORK AND HIS EYES TROUBLED HIM WITH SPOTS AND DASHES AND BLURS
4425-14497-0060 AND THE MELANCOLIA BOTH ON THE CANVAS AND IN HIS OWN MIND APPEARED LOVELIER THAN EVER THERE WAS A DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF IRRESPONSIBILITY UPON HIM SUCH AS THEY FEEL WHO WALKING AMONG THEIR FELLOW MEN
4425-14497-0061 AND SEEING THAT FEAR IS BUT WASTE OF THE LITTLE TIME LEFT ARE RIOTOUSLY HAPPY THE DAYS PASSED WITHOUT EVENT BESSIE ARRIVED PUNCTUALLY ALWAYS AND THOUGH HER VOICE SEEMED TO DICK TO COME FROM A DISTANCE
4425-14497-0062 HER FACE WAS ALWAYS VERY NEAR THE MELANCOLIA BEGAN TO FLAME ON THE CANVAS IN THE LIKENESS OF A WOMAN WHO HAD KNOWN ALL THE SORROW IN THE WORLD AND WAS LAUGHING AT IT IT WAS TRUE THAT THE CORNERS OF THE STUDIO DRAPED THEMSELVES IN GRAY FILM
4425-14497-0063 AND RETIRED INTO THE DARKNESS THAT THE SPOTS IN HIS EYES AND THE PAINS ACROSS HIS HEAD WERE VERY TROUBLESOME
4425-14497-0064 AND HE COULD NOT LAUGH AT HER ACCOUNTS OF HER OWN MELANCOLIA WHICH WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE FINISHED BUT THE FURIOUS DAYS OF TOIL AND THE NIGHTS OF WILD DREAMS MADE AMENDS FOR ALL AND THE SIDEBOARD WAS HIS BEST FRIEND ON EARTH BESSIE WAS SINGULARLY DULL
4425-14497-0065 SHE USED TO SHRIEK WITH RAGE WHEN DICK STARED AT HER BETWEEN HALF CLOSED EYES NOW SHE SULKED OR WATCHED HIM WITH DISGUST SAYING VERY LITTLE TORPENHOW HAD BEEN ABSENT FOR SIX WEEKS AN INCOHERENT NOTE HERALDED HIS RETURN NEWS
4425-14497-0066 GREAT NEWS HE WROTE THE NILGHAI KNOWS AND SO DOES THE KENEU WE'RE ALL BACK ON THURSDAY GET LUNCH AND CLEAN YOUR ACCOUTREMENTS DICK SHOWED BESSIE THE LETTER AND SHE ABUSED HIM FOR THAT HE HAD EVER SENT TORPENHOW AWAY AND RUINED HER LIFE
4425-14497-0067 WELL SAID DICK BRUTALLY YOU'RE BETTER AS YOU ARE INSTEAD OF MAKING LOVE TO SOME DRUNKEN BEAST IN THE STREET HE FELT THAT HE HAD RESCUED TORPENHOW FROM GREAT TEMPTATION
4425-14497-0068 MEAN YOU'LL SEE WHEN MISTER TORPENHOW COMES BACK IT WAS NOT LONG TO WAIT TORPENHOW MET BESSIE ON THE STAIRCASE WITHOUT A SIGN OF FEELING HE HAD NEWS THAT WAS MORE TO HIM THAN MANY BESSIES AND THE KENEU AND THE NILGHAI WERE TRAMPLING BEHIND HIM CALLING FOR DICK
4425-14497-0069 DRINKING LIKE A FISH BESSIE WHISPERED HE'S BEEN AT IT FOR NEARLY A MONTH SHE FOLLOWED THE MEN STEALTHILY TO HEAR JUDGMENT DONE THEY CAME INTO THE STUDIO REJOICING TO BE WELCOMED OVER EFFUSIVELY BY A DRAWN LINED SHRUNKEN
4425-14497-0070 HAGGARD WRECK UNSHAVEN BLUE WHITE ABOUT THE NOSTRILS STOOPING IN THE SHOULDERS AND PEERING UNDER HIS EYEBROWS NERVOUSLY THE DRINK HAD BEEN AT WORK AS STEADILY AS DICK IS THIS YOU SAID TORPENHOW
4425-14497-0071 ALL THAT'S LEFT OF ME SIT DOWN BINKIE'S QUITE WELL AND I'VE BEEN DOING SOME GOOD WORK HE REELED WHERE HE STOOD YOU'VE DONE SOME OF THE WORST WORK YOU'VE EVER DONE IN YOUR LIFE MAN ALIVE YOU'RE TORPENHOW TURNED TO HIS COMPANIONS APPEALINGLY
4425-14497-0072 AND THEY LEFT THE ROOM TO FIND LUNCH ELSEWHERE THEN HE SPOKE BUT SINCE THE REPROOF OF A FRIEND IS MUCH TOO SACRED AND INTIMATE A THING TO BE PRINTED AND SINCE TORPENHOW USED FIGURES AND METAPHORS WHICH WERE UNSEEMLY AND CONTEMPT UNTRANSLATABLE
4425-14497-0073 IT WILL NEVER BE KNOWN WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SAID TO DICK WHO BLINKED AND WINKED AND PICKED AT HIS HANDS AFTER A TIME THE CULPRIT BEGAN TO FEEL THE NEED OF A LITTLE SELF RESPECT HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT HE HAD NOT IN ANY WAY DEPARTED FROM VIRTUE
4425-14497-0074 OF WHICH TORPENHOW KNEW NOTHING HE WOULD EXPLAIN HE ROSE TRIED TO STRAIGHTEN HIS SHOULDERS AND SPOKE TO THE FACE HE COULD HARDLY SEE YOU ARE RIGHT HE SAID BUT I AM RIGHT TOO
4425-14497-0075 AFTER YOU WENT AWAY I HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH MY EYES SO I WENT TO AN OCULIST AND HE TURNED A GASOGENE I MEAN A GAS ENGINE INTO MY EYE THAT WAS VERY LONG AGO HE SAID SCAR ON THE HEAD
4425-14497-0076 SWORD CUT AND OPTIC NERVE MAKE A NOTE OF THAT SO I AM GOING BLIND I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO BEFORE I GO BLIND AND I SUPPOSE THAT I MUST DO IT I CANNOT SEE MUCH NOW BUT I CAN SEE BEST WHEN I AM DRUNK
4425-14497-0077 I DID NOT KNOW I WAS DRUNK TILL I WAS TOLD BUT I MUST GO ON WITH MY WORK IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT THERE IT IS
4425-14497-0078 AND LOOKED FOR APPLAUSE TORPENHOW SAID NOTHING AND DICK BEGAN TO WHIMPER FEEBLY FOR JOY AT SEEING TORPENHOW AGAIN FOR GRIEF AT MISDEEDS IF INDEED THEY WERE MISDEEDS
4425-14497-0079 THAT MADE TORPENHOW REMOTE AND UNSYMPATHETIC AND FOR CHILDISH VANITY HURT SINCE TORPENHOW HAD NOT GIVEN A WORD OF PRAISE TO HIS WONDERFUL PICTURE BESSIE LOOKED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AFTER A LONG PAUSE AND SAW THE TWO WALKING UP AND DOWN AS USUAL
4425-14497-0080 TORPENHOW'S HAND ON DICK'S SHOULDER HEREAT SHE SAID SOMETHING SO IMPROPER THAT IT SHOCKED EVEN BINKIE
