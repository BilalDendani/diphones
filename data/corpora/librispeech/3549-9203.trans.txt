3549-9203-0000 MANY YEARS AGO AS EVENING WAS CLOSING IN
3549-9203-0001 THE BOLT OF A MASSIVE DOOR CREAKED AND THEY ENTERED A MEPHITIC IN PACE WHERE THE DIM LIGHT REVEALED BETWEEN RINGS FASTENED TO THE WALL A BLOODSTAINED RACK A BRAZIER AND A JUG ON A PILE OF STRAW
3549-9203-0002 SAT A HAGGARD MAN OF UNCERTAIN AGE CLOTHED IN RAGS THIS PRISONER WAS NO OTHER THAN RABBI ASER ABARBANEL A JEW OF ARRAGON WHO ACCUSED OF USURY AND PITILESS SCORN FOR THE POOR
3549-9203-0003 HAD BEEN DAILY SUBJECTED TO TORTURE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR YET HIS BLINDNESS WAS AS DENSE AS HIS HIDE AND HE HAD REFUSED TO ABJURE HIS FAITH PROUD OF A FILIATION DATING BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS
3549-9203-0004 HE DESCENDED TALMUDICALLY FROM OTHONIEL AND CONSEQUENTLY FROM IPSIBOA THE WIFE OF THE LAST JUDGE OF ISRAEL A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAD SUSTAINED HIS COURAGE AMID INCESSANT TORTURE
3549-9203-0005 WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AT THE THOUGHT OF THIS RESOLUTE SOUL REJECTING SALVATION THE VENERABLE
3549-9203-0006 APPROACHING THE SHUDDERING RABBI ADDRESSED HIM AS FOLLOWS MY SON REJOICE YOUR TRIALS HERE BELOW ARE ABOUT TO END IF IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH OBSTINACY I WAS FORCED TO PERMIT WITH DEEP REGRET
3549-9203-0007 BUT GOD ALONE CAN JUDGE YOUR SOUL PERHAPS INFINITE MERCY WILL SHINE UPON YOU AT THE LAST MOMENT WE MUST HOPE SO THERE ARE EXAMPLES SO SLEEP IN PEACE TO NIGHT
3549-9203-0008 TOMORROW YOU WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE AUTO DA FE THAT IS YOU WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE
3549-9203-0009 THE SYMBOLICAL FLAMES OF THE EVERLASTING FIRE IT BURNS AS YOU KNOW ONLY AT A DISTANCE MY SON AND DEATH IS AT LEAST TWO HOURS OFTEN THREE IN COMING ON ACCOUNT OF THE WET ICED BANDAGES
3549-9203-0010 THERE WILL BE FORTY THREE OF YOU PLACED IN THE LAST ROW YOU WILL HAVE TIME TO INVOKE GOD AND OFFER TO HIM THIS BAPTISM OF FIRE WHICH IS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HOPE IN THE LIGHT AND REST
3549-9203-0011 THE PRIOR TENDERLY EMBRACED HIM THEN CAME THE TURN OF THE FRA REDEMPTOR WHO IN A LOW TONE ENTREATED THE JEW'S FORGIVENESS FOR WHAT HE HAD MADE HIM SUFFER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDEEMING HIM
3549-9203-0012 THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERNS THROUGH A CHINK BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE WALL A MORBID IDEA OF HOPE DUE TO THE WEAKNESS OF HIS BRAIN STIRRED HIS WHOLE BEING HE DRAGGED HIMSELF TOWARD THE STRANGE APPEARANCE THEN
3549-9203-0013 VERY GENTLY AND CAUTIOUSLY SLIPPING ONE FINGER INTO THE CREVICE HE DREW THE DOOR TOWARD HIM MARVELOUS BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCIDENT THE FAMILIAR WHO CLOSED IT HAD TURNED THE HUGE KEY AN INSTANT BEFORE IT STRUCK THE STONE CASING
3549-9203-0014 SO THAT THE RUSTY BOLT NOT HAVING ENTERED THE HOLE THE DOOR AGAIN ROLLED ON ITS HINGES THE RABBI VENTURED TO GLANCE OUTSIDE BY THE AID OF A SORT OF LUMINOUS DUSK
3549-9203-0015 HE DISTINGUISHED AT FIRST A SEMICIRCLE OF WALLS INDENTED BY WINDING STAIRS AND OPPOSITE TO HIM AT THE TOP OF FIVE OR SIX STONE STEPS A SORT OF BLACK PORTAL OPENING INTO AN IMMENSE CORRIDOR
3549-9203-0016 ONLY ON ONE SIDE THE LEFT HEAVILY GRATED LOOPHOLES SUNK IN THE WALLS ADMITTED A LIGHT WHICH MUST BE THAT OF EVENING FOR CRIMSON BARS AT INTERVALS RESTED ON THE FLAGS OF THE PAVEMENT
3549-9203-0017 SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF A SANDALED FOOT APPROACHING REACHED HIS EARS HE TREMBLED VIOLENTLY FEAR STIFLED HIM HIS SIGHT GREW DIM WELL
3549-9203-0018 A FRIGHTFUL FIGURE AND VANISHED THE SUSPENSE WHICH THE RABBI HAD ENDURED SEEMED TO HAVE SUSPENDED THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE AND HE LAY NEARLY AN HOUR UNABLE TO MOVE FEARING AN INCREASE OF TORTURES IF HE WERE CAPTURED
3549-9203-0019 HE COULD DOUBT NO LONGER HE BEGAN TO CRAWL TOWARD THE CHANCE OF ESCAPE EXHAUSTED BY SUFFERING AND HUNGER TREMBLING WITH PAIN HE PRESSED ONWARD
3549-9203-0020 AT THIS SPECTACLE RABBI ASER ABARBANEL CLOSED HIS EYES HIS HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT IT ALMOST SUFFOCATED HIM HIS RAGS WERE DAMP WITH THE COLD SWEAT OF AGONY
3549-9203-0021 SCORCH HIS FLESH HE WAS TO BE ONCE MORE A LIVING WOUND FAINTING BREATHLESS WITH FLUTTERING EYELIDS HE SHIVERED AT THE TOUCH OF THE MONK'S FLOATING ROBE BUT STRANGE YET NATURAL FACT
3549-9203-0022 AGAINST WHICH HIS FACE WAS PRESSED HE IMAGINED HE BEHELD TWO FIERCE EYES WATCHING HIM HE FLUNG HIS HEAD BACK IN A SUDDEN FRENZY OF FRIGHT HIS HAIR FAIRLY BRISTLING YET NO NO
3549-9203-0023 ABSURDLY NO DOUBT TO BE DELIVERANCE TOWARD THE DARKNESS FROM WHICH HE WAS NOW BARELY THIRTY PACES DISTANT HE PRESSED FORWARD FASTER ON HIS KNEES HIS HANDS AT FULL LENGTH DRAGGING HIMSELF PAINFULLY ALONG
3549-9203-0024 EVERY NERVE IN THE MISERABLE FUGITIVE'S BODY THRILLED WITH HOPE HE EXAMINED IT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM THOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ITS OUTLINES IN THE SURROUNDING DARKNESS HE PASSED HIS HAND OVER IT NO BOLT
3549-9203-0025 NO LOCK A LATCH HE STARTED UP THE LATCH YIELDED TO THE PRESSURE OF HIS THUMB THE DOOR SILENTLY SWUNG OPEN BEFORE HIM
3549-9203-0026 MURMURED THE RABBI IN A TRANSPORT OF GRATITUDE AS STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD HE BEHELD THE SCENE BEFORE HIM THE DOOR HAD OPENED INTO THE GARDENS ABOVE WHICH ARCHED A STARLIT SKY INTO SPRING
3549-9203-0027 HE WOULD JOURNEY ALL NIGHT THROUGH THE LEMON GROVES WHOSE FRAGRANCE REACHED HIM ONCE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND HE WAS SAFE HE INHALED THE DELICIOUS AIR THE BREEZE REVIVED HIM HIS LUNGS EXPANDED HE FELT IN HIS SWELLING HEART
3549-9203-0028 THE VENI FORAS OF LAZARUS AND TO THANK ONCE MORE THE GOD WHO HAD BESTOWED THIS MERCY UPON HIM HE EXTENDED HIS ARMS RAISING HIS EYES TOWARD HEAVEN IT WAS AN ECSTASY OF JOY
3549-9203-0029 A TALL FIGURE ACTUALLY DID STAND DIRECTLY BEFORE HIM HE LOWERED HIS EYES AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS GASPING FOR BREATH DAZED WITH FIXED EYES FAIRLY DRIVELING WITH TERROR
3549-9203-0030 HORROR HE WAS IN THE CLASP OF THE GRAND INQUISITOR HIMSELF
3549-9203-0031 GASPED IN AGONY IN THE ASCETIC'S EMBRACE VAGUELY COMPREHENDING THAT ALL THE PHASES OF THIS FATAL EVENING WERE ONLY A PREARRANGED TORTURE THAT OF HOPE THE GRAND INQUISITOR
