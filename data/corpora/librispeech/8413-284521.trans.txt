8413-284521-0000 THE BURDOCK NEVER GROWS ALONE BUT WHERE THERE GROWS ONE THERE ALWAYS GROW SEVERAL
8413-284521-0001 GREAT WHITE SNAILS WHICH PERSONS OF QUALITY IN FORMER TIMES MADE FRICASSEES OF ATE AND SAID
8413-284521-0002 FOR THEY THOUGHT IT TASTED SO DELICATE LIVED ON DOCK LEAVES AND THEREFORE BURDOCK SEEDS WERE SOWN NOW THERE WAS AN OLD MANOR HOUSE WHERE THEY NO LONGER ATE SNAILS THEY WERE QUITE EXTINCT
8413-284521-0003 ALL WAS BURDOCKS AND THERE LIVED
8413-284521-0004 VENERABLE OLD SNAILS THEY THEMSELVES KNEW NOT HOW OLD THEY WERE BUT THEY COULD REMEMBER VERY WELL THAT THERE HAD BEEN MANY MORE THAT THEY WERE OF A FAMILY FROM FOREIGN LANDS AND THAT FOR THEM AND THEIRS THE WHOLE FOREST WAS PLANTED THEY HAD NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE IT
8413-284521-0005 BUT THEY KNEW THAT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING MORE IN THE WORLD WHICH WAS CALLED THE MANOR HOUSE AND THAT THERE THEY WERE BOILED
8413-284521-0006 BUT WHAT HAPPENED FURTHER THEY KNEW NOT OR IN FACT
8413-284521-0007 BUT IT WAS SAID TO BE DELIGHTFUL AND PARTICULARLY GENTEEL NEITHER THE CHAFERS THE TOADS NOR THE EARTH WORMS WHOM THEY ASKED ABOUT IT COULD GIVE THEM ANY INFORMATION
8413-284521-0008 THAT THEY KNEW THE FOREST WAS PLANTED FOR THEIR SAKE
8413-284521-0009 NOW THEY LIVED A VERY LONELY AND HAPPY LIFE AND AS THEY HAD NO CHILDREN THEMSELVES THEY HAD ADOPTED A LITTLE COMMON SNAIL WHICH THEY BROUGHT UP AS THEIR OWN BUT THE LITTLE ONE WOULD NOT GROW FOR HE WAS OF A COMMON FAMILY BUT THE OLD ONES ESPECIALLY DAME MOTHER SNAIL THOUGHT THEY COULD OBSERVE HOW HE INCREASED IN SIZE
8413-284521-0010 AND SHE BEGGED FATHER IF HE COULD NOT SEE IT THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST FEEL THE LITTLE SNAIL'S SHELL AND THEN HE FELT IT
8413-284521-0011 THERE ARE ALSO RAIN DROPS SAID MOTHER SNAIL
8413-284521-0012 YOU WILL SEE THAT IT WILL BE WET HERE I AM VERY HAPPY TO THINK THAT WE HAVE OUR GOOD HOUSE AND THE LITTLE ONE HAS HIS ALSO
8413-284521-0013 THAN FOR ALL OTHER CREATURES SURE ENOUGH BUT CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT WE ARE FOLKS OF QUALITY IN THE WORLD
8413-284521-0014 OUR SON SHALL NOT GO INTO AN ANT HILL IF YOU KNOW NOTHING BETTER THAN THAT WE SHALL GIVE THE COMMISSION TO THE WHITE GNATS THEY FLY FAR AND WIDE IN RAIN AND SUNSHINE THEY KNOW THE WHOLE FOREST HERE BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT WE HAVE A WIFE FOR HIM SAID THE GNATS
8413-284521-0015 AT A HUNDRED HUMAN PACES FROM HERE THERE SITS A LITTLE SNAIL IN HER HOUSE ON A GOOSEBERRY BUSH
8413-284521-0016 IT IS ONLY A HUNDRED HUMAN PACES WELL THEN LET HER COME TO HIM SAID THE OLD ONES
8413-284521-0017 AND SO THEY WENT AND FETCHED LITTLE MISS SNAIL IT WAS A WHOLE WEEK BEFORE SHE ARRIVED BUT THEREIN WAS JUST THE VERY BEST OF IT FOR ONE COULD THUS SEE THAT SHE WAS OF THE SAME SPECIES AND THEN THE MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED SIX EARTH WORMS SHONE AS WELL AS THEY COULD IN OTHER RESPECTS THE WHOLE WENT OFF VERY QUIETLY
8413-284521-0018 HE WAS TOO MUCH AFFECTED AND SO THEY GAVE THEM AS A DOWRY AND INHERITANCE THE WHOLE FOREST OF BURDOCKS AND SAID
8413-284521-0019 AND IF THEY LIVED HONESTLY AND DECENTLY AND INCREASED AND MULTIPLIED
8413-284521-0020 BE BOILED BLACK AND LAID ON SILVER DISHES AFTER THIS SPEECH WAS MADE THE OLD ONES CREPT INTO THEIR SHELLS AND NEVER MORE CAME OUT
8413-284521-0021 SO FROM THIS THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE MANOR HOUSE HAD FALLEN TO RUINS AND THAT ALL THE MEN IN THE WORLD WERE EXTINCT AND AS NO ONE CONTRADICTED THEM SO OF COURSE IT WAS SO
