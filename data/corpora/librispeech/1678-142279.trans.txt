1678-142279-0000 CHAPTER FIVE DECISION I ASK THEE FOR A THOUGHTFUL LOVE THROUGH CONSTANT WATCHING WISE TO MEET THE GLAD WITH JOYFUL SMILES AND TO WIPE THE WEEPING EYES
1678-142279-0001 AND A HEART AT LEISURE FROM ITSELF TO SOOTHE AND SYMPATHISE
1678-142279-0002 MARGARET MADE A GOOD LISTENER TO ALL HER MOTHER'S LITTLE PLANS FOR ADDING SOME SMALL COMFORTS TO THE LOT OF THE POORER PARISHIONERS SHE COULD NOT HELP LISTENING THOUGH EACH NEW PROJECT WAS A STAB TO HER HEART
1678-142279-0003 BY THE TIME THE FROST HAD SET IN THEY SHOULD BE FAR AWAY FROM HELSTONE OLD SIMON'S RHEUMATISM MIGHT BE BAD AND HIS EYESIGHT WORSE THERE WOULD BE NO ONE TO GO AND READ TO HIM AND COMFORT HIM WITH LITTLE PORRINGERS OF BROTH AND GOOD RED FLANNEL
1678-142279-0004 OR IF THERE WAS IT WOULD BE A STRANGER AND THE OLD MAN WOULD WATCH IN VAIN FOR HER MARY DOMVILLE'S LITTLE CRIPPLED BOY WOULD CRAWL IN VAIN TO THE DOOR AND LOOK FOR HER COMING THROUGH THE FOREST THESE POOR FRIENDS WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY SHE HAD FORSAKEN THEM
1678-142279-0005 AND THERE WERE MANY OTHERS BESIDES PAPA HAS ALWAYS SPENT THE INCOME HE DERIVED FROM HIS LIVING IN THE PARISH I AM PERHAPS ENCROACHING UPON THE NEXT DUES
1678-142279-0006 OH MAMMA LET US DO ALL WE CAN SAID MARGARET EAGERLY NOT SEEING THE PRUDENTIAL SIDE OF THE QUESTION ONLY GRASPING AT THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE RENDERING SUCH HELP FOR THE LAST TIME WE MAY NOT BE HERE LONG
1678-142279-0007 DO YOU FEEL ILL MY DARLING ASKED MISSUS HALE ANXIOUSLY MISUNDERSTANDING MARGARET'S HINT OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR STAY AT HELSTONE YOU LOOK PALE AND TIRED IT IS THIS SOFT DAMP UNHEALTHY AIR
1678-142279-0008 IT IS NOT THAT IT IS DELICIOUS AIR IT SMELLS OF THE FRESHEST PUREST FRAGRANCE AFTER THE SMOKINESS OF HARLEY STREET BUT I AM TIRED IT SURELY MUST BE NEAR BEDTIME
1678-142279-0009 NOT FAR OFF IT IS HALF PAST NINE YOU HAD BETTER GO TO BED AT ONCE DEAR ASK DIXON FOR SOME GRUEL I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN BED
1678-142279-0010 OR THE BAD AIR FROM SOME OF THE STAGNANT PONDS OH MAMMA SAID MARGARET FAINTLY SMILING AS SHE KISSED HER MOTHER I AM QUITE WELL DON'T ALARM YOURSELF ABOUT ME I AM ONLY TIRED MARGARET WENT UPSTAIRS
1678-142279-0011 TO SOOTHE HER MOTHER'S ANXIETY SHE SUBMITTED TO A BASIN OF GRUEL SHE WAS LYING LANGUIDLY IN BED WHEN MISSUS HALE CAME UP TO MAKE SOME LAST INQUIRIES AND KISS HER BEFORE GOING TO HER OWN ROOM FOR THE NIGHT BUT THE INSTANT SHE HEARD HER MOTHER'S DOOR LOCKED
1678-142279-0012 CREAKING OF ONE OF THE BOARDS REMINDED HER THAT SHE MUST MAKE NO NOISE SHE WENT AND CURLED HERSELF UP
1678-142279-0013 THAT MORNING WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED OUT HER HEART HAD
1678-142279-0014 WHICH FORETOLD A FINE AND SUNNY DAY THIS EVENING SIXTEEN HOURS AT MOST HAD PAST BY SHE SAT DOWN TOO FULL OF SORROW TO CRY BUT WITH A DULL COLD PAIN
1678-142279-0015 NEVER TO RETURN MISTER HENRY LENNOX'S VISIT HIS OFFER WAS LIKE A DREAM A THING BESIDE HER ACTUAL LIFE THE HARD REALITY WAS
1678-142279-0016 THAT HER FATHER HAD SO ADMITTED TEMPTING DOUBTS INTO HIS MIND AS TO BECOME A SCHISMATIC AN OUTCAST ALL THE CHANGES CONSEQUENT UPON THIS GROUPED THEMSELVES AROUND THAT ONE GREAT BLIGHTING FACT
1678-142279-0017 SHE LOOKED OUT UPON THE DARK GRAY LINES OF THE CHURCH TOWER SQUARE AND STRAIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THE VIEW CUTTING AGAINST THE DEEP BLUE TRANSPARENT DEPTHS BEYOND INTO WHICH SHE GAZED AND FELT THAT SHE MIGHT GAZE FOR EVER
1678-142279-0018 SEEING AT EVERY MOMENT SOME FARTHER DISTANCE AND YET NO SIGN OF GOD IT SEEMED TO HER AT THE MOMENT AS IF THE EARTH WAS MORE UTTERLY DESOLATE THAN IF GIRT IN BY AN IRON DOME
1678-142279-0019 BEHIND WHICH THERE MIGHT BE THE INEFFACEABLE PEACE AND GLORY OF THE ALMIGHTY THOSE NEVER ENDING DEPTHS OF SPACE IN THEIR STILL SERENITY WERE MORE MOCKING TO HER THAN ANY MATERIAL BOUNDS COULD BE SHUTTING IN THE CRIES OF EARTH'S SUFFERERS
1678-142279-0020 WHICH NOW MIGHT ASCEND INTO THAT INFINITE SPLENDOUR OF VASTNESS AND BE LOST LOST FOR EVER BEFORE THEY REACHED HIS THRONE IN THIS MOOD HER FATHER CAME IN UNHEARD
1678-142279-0021 THE MOONLIGHT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO LET HIM SEE HIS DAUGHTER IN HER UNUSUAL PLACE AND ATTITUDE HE CAME TO HER AND TOUCHED HER SHOULDER BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE THAT HE WAS THERE MARGARET I HEARD YOU WERE UP
1678-142279-0022 I COULD NOT HELP COMING IN TO ASK YOU TO PRAY WITH ME TO SAY THE LORD'S PRAYER THAT WILL DO GOOD TO BOTH OF US MISTER HALE AND MARGARET KNELT BY THE WINDOW SEAT HE LOOKING UP
1678-142279-0023 SHE BOWED DOWN IN HUMBLE SHAME GOD WAS THERE CLOSE AROUND THEM HEARING HER FATHER'S WHISPERED WORDS HER FATHER MIGHT BE A HERETIC BUT HAD NOT SHE IN HER DESPAIRING DOUBTS NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE
1678-142279-0024 SHE SPOKE NOT A WORD BUT STOLE TO BED AFTER HER FATHER HAD LEFT HER LIKE A CHILD ASHAMED OF ITS FAULT IF THE WORLD WAS FULL OF PERPLEXING PROBLEMS SHE WOULD TRUST AND ONLY ASK TO SEE THE ONE STEP NEEDFUL FOR THE HOUR
1678-142279-0025 MISTER LENNOX HIS VISIT HIS PROPOSAL THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHICH HAD BEEN SO RUDELY PUSHED ASIDE BY THE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS OF THE DAY HAUNTED HER DREAMS THAT NIGHT
1678-142279-0026 HE WAS CLIMBING UP SOME TREE OF FABULOUS HEIGHT TO REACH THE BRANCH WHEREON WAS SLUNG HER BONNET HE WAS FALLING AND SHE WAS STRUGGLING TO SAVE HIM BUT HELD BACK BY SOME INVISIBLE POWERFUL HAND HE WAS DEAD
1678-142279-0027 MISERABLE UNRESTING NIGHT ILL PREPARATION FOR THE COMING DAY SHE AWOKE WITH A START UNREFRESHED AND CONSCIOUS OF SOME REALITY WORSE EVEN THAN HER FEVERISH DREAMS
1678-142279-0028 IT ALL CAME BACK UPON HER NOT MERELY THE SORROW BUT THE TERRIBLE DISCORD IN THE SORROW WHERE TO WHAT DISTANCE APART HAD HER FATHER WANDERED LED BY DOUBTS WHICH WERE TO HER TEMPTATIONS OF THE EVIL ONE
1678-142279-0029 SHE LONGED TO ASK AND YET WOULD NOT HAVE HEARD FOR ALL THE WORLD THE FINE CRISP MORNING MADE HER MOTHER FEEL PARTICULARLY WELL AND HAPPY AT BREAKFAST TIME
1678-142279-0030 SHE TALKED ON PLANNING VILLAGE KINDNESSES UNHEEDING THE SILENCE OF HER HUSBAND AND THE MONOSYLLABIC ANSWERS OF MARGARET BEFORE THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY MISTER HALE GOT UP HE LEANED ONE HAND ON THE TABLE AS IF TO SUPPORT HIMSELF
1678-142279-0031 I AM GOING TO BRACY COMMON AND WILL ASK FARMER DOBSON TO GIVE ME SOMETHING FOR DINNER I SHALL BE BACK TO TEA AT SEVEN HE DID NOT LOOK AT EITHER OF THEM BUT MARGARET KNEW WHAT HE MEANT BY SEVEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT MUST BE MADE TO HER MOTHER
1678-142279-0032 MISTER HALE WOULD HAVE DELAYED MAKING IT TILL HALF PAST SIX BUT MARGARET WAS OF DIFFERENT STUFF SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE IMPENDING WEIGHT ON HER MIND ALL THE DAY LONG BETTER GET THE WORST OVER THE DAY WOULD BE TOO SHORT TO COMFORT HER MOTHER
1678-142279-0033 BUT WHILE SHE STOOD BY THE WINDOW THINKING HOW TO BEGIN AND WAITING FOR THE SERVANT TO HAVE LEFT THE ROOM HER MOTHER HAD GONE UP STAIRS TO PUT ON HER THINGS TO GO TO THE SCHOOL SHE CAME DOWN READY EQUIPPED IN A BRISKER MOOD THAN USUAL
1678-142279-0034 SAID MARGARET PUTTING HER ARM ROUND MISSUS HALE'S WAIST THEY PASSED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW MISSUS HALE SPOKE SAID SOMETHING MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT HER EYE CAUGHT ON A BEE ENTERING A DEEP BELLED FLOWER
1678-142279-0035 WHEN THAT BEE FLEW FORTH WITH HIS SPOIL SHE WOULD BEGIN THAT SHOULD BE THE SIGN OUT HE CAME MAMMA PAPA IS GOING TO LEAVE HELSTONE SHE BLURTED FORTH
1678-142279-0036 THERE WERE THE THREE HARD FACTS HARDLY SPOKEN WHAT MAKES YOU SAY SO
1678-142279-0037 PAPA HIMSELF SAID MARGARET LONGING TO SAY SOMETHING GENTLE AND CONSOLING BUT LITERALLY NOT KNOWING HOW THEY WERE CLOSE TO A GARDEN BENCH
1678-142279-0038 MISSUS HALE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO CRY I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
1678-142279-0039 YOU NO MOTHER I HAVE MADE NO MISTAKE PAPA HAS WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP SAYING THAT HE HAS SUCH DOUBTS THAT HE CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY REMAIN A PRIEST OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THAT HE MUST GIVE UP HELSTONE
1678-142279-0040 HE HAS ALSO CONSULTED MISTER BELL FREDERICK'S GODFATHER YOU KNOW MAMMA
1678-142279-0041 MISSUS HALE LOOKED UP IN MARGARET'S FACE ALL THE TIME SHE WAS SPEAKING THESE WORDS THE SHADOW ON HER COUNTENANCE TOLD THAT SHE AT LEAST BELIEVED IN THE TRUTH OF WHAT SHE SAID
1678-142279-0042 I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE TRUE SAID MISSUS HALE AT LENGTH
1678-142279-0043 IT CAME STRONGLY UPON MARGARET'S MIND THAT HER MOTHER OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT WHATEVER HER FAULTS OF DISCONTENT AND REPINING MIGHT HAVE BEEN IT WAS AN ERROR IN HER FATHER TO HAVE LEFT HER TO LEARN HIS CHANGE OF OPINION AND HIS APPROACHING CHANGE OF LIFE
1678-142279-0044 FROM HER BETTER INFORMED CHILD MARGARET SAT DOWN BY HER MOTHER AND TOOK HER UNRESISTING HEAD ON HER BREAST BENDING HER OWN SOFT CHEEKS DOWN CARESSINGLY TO TOUCH HER FACE
1678-142279-0045 DEAR DARLING MAMMA WE WERE SO AFRAID OF GIVING YOU PAIN PAPA FELT SO ACUTELY
1678-142279-0046 YESTERDAY ONLY YESTERDAY REPLIED MARGARET DETECTING THE JEALOUSY WHICH PROMPTED THE INQUIRY POOR PAPA TRYING TO DIVERT HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS INTO COMPASSIONATE SYMPATHY FOR ALL HER FATHER HAD GONE THROUGH MISSUS HALE RAISED HER HEAD
1678-142279-0047 MARGARET SHOOK HER HEAD AND THE TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES
1678-142279-0048 I'M AFRAID NOT SAID MARGARET BUT I DID NOT ASK I COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR WHAT HE MIGHT ANSWER IT IS ALL SETTLED AT ANY RATE HE IS GOING TO LEAVE HELSTONE IN A FORTNIGHT
1678-142279-0049 I AM NOT SURE IF HE DID NOT SAY HE HAD SENT IN HIS DEED OF RESIGNATION
1678-142279-0050 I DO THINK THIS IS
1678-142279-0051 RIGHT I CALL IT VERY UNFEELING SAID SHE BEGINNING TO TAKE RELIEF IN TEARS
1678-142279-0052 I DARE SAY
1678-142279-0053 MISTAKEN AS MARGARET FELT HER FATHER'S CONDUCT TO HAVE BEEN SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR IT BLAMED BY HER MOTHER SHE KNEW THAT HIS VERY RESERVE HAD ORIGINATED IN A TENDERNESS FOR HER WHICH MIGHT BE COWARDLY
1678-142279-0054 BUT WAS NOT UNFEELING I ALMOST HOPED YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN GLAD TO LEAVE HELSTONE MAMMA
1678-142279-0055 IT IS WELL HE IS NOT ALIVE TO SEE WHAT YOUR FATHER HAS COME TO EVERY DAY AFTER DINNER WHEN I WAS A GIRL LIVING WITH YOUR AUNT SHAW AT BERESFORD COURT SIR JOHN USED TO GIVE FOR THE FIRST TOAST
1678-142279-0056 CHURCH AND KING AND DOWN WITH THE RUMP MARGARET WAS GLAD THAT HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS WERE TURNED AWAY FROM THE FACT OF HER HUSBAND'S SILENCE TO HER ON THE POINT WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SO NEAR HIS HEART
1678-142279-0057 NEXT TO THE SERIOUS VITAL ANXIETY AS TO THE NATURE OF HER FATHER'S DOUBTS THIS WAS THE ONE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE CASE THAT GAVE MARGARET THE MOST PAIN
1678-142279-0058 THE GORMANS WHO ARE OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS TO CALL SOCIETY AND WE HARDLY EVER SEE THEM HAVE BEEN IN TRADE JUST AS MUCH AS THESE MILTON NORTHERN PEOPLE YES SAID MISSUS HALE ALMOST INDIGNANTLY
1678-142279-0059 AND WERE BROUGHT INTO SOME KIND OF INTERCOURSE WITH THEM
1678-142279-0060 WE SHALL HAVE LITTLE ENOUGH TO DO WITH THEM WHY ON EARTH HAS YOUR FATHER FIXED ON MILTON NORTHERN TO LIVE IN PARTLY SAID MARGARET SIGHING
1678-142279-0061 BECAUSE IT IS SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM HELSTONE PARTLY BECAUSE MISTER BELL SAYS THERE IS AN OPENING THERE FOR A PRIVATE TUTOR PRIVATE TUTOR IN MILTON
1678-142279-0062 MISSUS HALE WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME QUIETLY CRYING AT LAST SHE SAID AND THE FURNITURE HOW IN THE WORLD ARE WE TO MANAGE THE REMOVAL I NEVER REMOVED IN MY LIFE AND ONLY A FORTNIGHT TO THINK ABOUT IT
1678-142279-0063 MARGARET WAS INEXPRESSIBLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HER MOTHER'S ANXIETY AND DISTRESS WAS LOWERED TO THIS POINT SO INSIGNIFICANT TO HERSELF AND ON WHICH SHE COULD DO SO MUCH TO HELP
1678-142279-0064 SHE PLANNED AND PROMISED AND LED HER MOTHER ON TO ARRANGE FULLY AS MUCH AS COULD BE FIXED BEFORE THEY KNEW SOMEWHAT MORE DEFINITIVELY WHAT MISTER HALE INTENDED TO DO THROUGHOUT THE DAY MARGARET NEVER LEFT HER MOTHER
1678-142279-0065 BENDING HER WHOLE SOUL TO SYMPATHISE IN ALL THE VARIOUS TURNS HER FEELINGS TOOK TOWARDS EVENING ESPECIALLY AS SHE BECAME MORE AND MORE ANXIOUS THAT HER FATHER SHOULD FIND A SOOTHING WELCOME HOME AWAITING HIM AFTER HIS RETURN FROM
1678-142279-0066 HIS DAY OF FATIGUE AND DISTRESS SHE DWELT UPON WHAT HE MUST HAVE BORNE IN SECRET FOR LONG HER MOTHER ONLY REPLIED COLDLY THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE TOLD HER AND THAT THEN AT ANY RATE HE WOULD HAVE HAD AN ADVISER TO GIVE HIM COUNSEL
1678-142279-0067 IN THE HALL SHE DARED NOT GO TO MEET HIM AND TELL HIM WHAT SHE HAD DONE ALL DAY FOR FEAR OF HER MOTHER'S JEALOUS ANNOYANCE SHE HEARD HIM LINGER
1678-142279-0068 AS IF AWAITING HER OR SOME SIGN OF HER AND SHE DARED NOT STIR SHE SAW BY HER MOTHER'S TWITCHING LIPS AND CHANGING COLOUR THAT SHE TOO WAS AWARE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD RETURNED PRESENTLY
1678-142279-0069 HE OPENED THE ROOM DOOR AND STOOD THERE UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO COME IN HIS FACE WAS GRAY AND PALE HE HAD A TIMID FEARFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES SOMETHING ALMOST PITIFUL TO SEE IN A MAN'S FACE
1678-142279-0070 BUT THAT LOOK OF DESPONDENT UNCERTAINTY OF MENTAL AND BODILY LANGUOR
1678-142279-0071 THOUGH THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN TO ARRANGE THE ROOM THE AFFRIGHTED GIRL STOLE OUT AGAIN ON TIP TOE AND WENT AND TOLD MISSUS DIXON THAT MISS HALE WAS CRYING AS IF HER HEART WOULD BREAK SHE WAS SURE SHE WOULD MAKE HERSELF DEADLY ILL IF SHE WENT ON AT THAT RATE
1678-142279-0072 I DID NOT HEAR YOU COME INTO THE ROOM SAID MARGARET RESUMING HER TREMBLING SELF RESTRAINT IS IT VERY LATE CONTINUED SHE LIFTING HERSELF LANGUIDLY OFF THE BED
1678-142279-0073 YET LETTING HER FEET TOUCH THE GROUND WITHOUT FAIRLY STANDING DOWN AS SHE SHADED HER WET RUFFLED HAIR OFF HER FACE AND TRIED TO LOOK AS THOUGH NOTHING WERE THE MATTER
1678-142279-0074 AS IF SHE HAD ONLY BEEN ASLEEP I HARDLY CAN TELL WHAT TIME IT IS REPLIED DIXON IN AN AGGRIEVED TONE OF VOICE SINCE YOUR MAMMA TOLD ME THIS TERRIBLE NEWS WHEN I DRESSED HER FOR TEA I'VE LOST ALL COUNT OF TIME
1678-142279-0075 WHEN CHARLOTTE TOLD ME JUST NOW YOU WERE SOBBING MISS HALE I THOUGHT NO WONDER POOR THING AND MASTER THINKING OF TURNING DISSENTER AT HIS TIME OF LIFE WHEN IF IT IS NOT TO BE SAID HE'S DONE WELL IN THE CHURCH HE'S NOT DONE BADLY AFTER ALL
1678-142279-0076 I HAD A COUSIN MISS WHO TURNED METHODIST PREACHER AFTER HE WAS FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND A TAILOR ALL HIS LIFE BUT THEN HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A PAIR OF TROUSERS TO FIT FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD BEEN IN THE TRADE SO IT WAS NO WONDER BUT FOR MASTER
1678-142279-0077 HE NEVER LIKED YOUR MARRYING MISTER HALE BUT IF HE COULD HAVE KNOWN IT WOULD HAVE COME TO THIS
1678-142279-0078 DIXON HAD BEEN SO MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO COMMENT UPON MISTER HALE'S PROCEEDINGS TO HER MISTRESS WHO LISTENED TO HER OR NOT AS SHE WAS IN THE HUMOUR THAT SHE NEVER NOTICED MARGARET'S FLASHING EYE AND DILATING NOSTRIL
1678-142279-0079 BY A SERVANT TO HER FACE DIXON SHE SAID IN THE LOW TONE SHE ALWAYS USED WHEN MUCH EXCITED WHICH HAD A SOUND IN IT AS OF SOME DISTANT TURMOIL OR THREATENING STORM BREAKING FAR AWAY
1678-142279-0080 DIXON YOU FORGET TO WHOM YOU ARE SPEAKING SHE STOOD UPRIGHT AND FIRM ON HER FEET NOW CONFRONTING THE WAITING MAID AND FIXING HER WITH HER STEADY DISCERNING EYE I AM MISTER HALE'S DAUGHTER
1678-142279-0081 GO YOU HAVE MADE A STRANGE MISTAKE AND ONE THAT I AM SURE YOUR OWN GOOD FEELING WILL MAKE YOU SORRY FOR WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT DIXON HUNG IRRESOLUTELY ABOUT THE ROOM FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
1678-142279-0082 MARGARET REPEATED YOU MAY LEAVE ME DIXON I WISH YOU TO GO DIXON DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO RESENT THESE DECIDED WORDS OR TO CRY EITHER COURSE WOULD HAVE DONE WITH HER MISTRESS
1678-142279-0083 WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH TO SAY IN A HALF HUMBLE HALF INJURED TONE MAYN'T I UNFASTEN YOUR GOWN MISS AND DO YOUR HAIR NO NOT TO NIGHT THANK YOU
1678-142279-0084 AND MARGARET GRAVELY LIGHTED HER OUT OF THE ROOM AND BOLTED THE DOOR FROM HENCEFORTH DIXON OBEYED AND ADMIRED MARGARET SHE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO LIKE POOR MASTER FREDERICK BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT DIXON AS DO MANY OTHERS
1678-142279-0085 LIKED TO FEEL HERSELF RULED BY A POWERFUL AND DECIDED NATURE MARGARET NEEDED ALL DIXON'S HELP IN ACTION AND SILENCE IN WORDS
1678-142279-0086 SO THE ENERGY CAME OUT IN DOING RATHER THAN IN SPEAKING A FORTNIGHT WAS A VERY SHORT TIME TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR SO SERIOUS A REMOVAL AS DIXON SAID ANY ONE BUT A GENTLEMAN INDEED ALMOST ANY OTHER GENTLEMAN
1678-142279-0087 BUT CATCHING A LOOK AT MARGARET'S STRAIGHT STERN BROW JUST HERE SHE COUGHED THE REMAINDER OF THE SENTENCE AWAY AND MEEKLY TOOK THE HOREHOUND DROP THAT MARGARET OFFERED HER TO STOP THE LITTLE TICKLING AT MY CHEST MISS
1678-142279-0088 BUT ALMOST ANY ONE BUT MISTER HALE WOULD HAVE HAD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO SEE THAT IN SO SHORT A TIME IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIX ON ANY HOUSE IN MILTON NORTHERN OR INDEED ELSEWHERE
1678-142279-0089 TO WHICH THEY COULD REMOVE THE FURNITURE THAT HAD OF NECESSITY TO BE TAKEN OUT OF HELSTONE VICARAGE MISSUS HALE OVERPOWERED BY ALL THE TROUBLES AND NECESSITIES FOR IMMEDIATE HOUSEHOLD DECISIONS THAT SEEMED TO COME UPON HER AT ONCE
1678-142279-0090 BECAME REALLY ILL AND MARGARET ALMOST FELT IT AS A RELIEF WHEN HER MOTHER FAIRLY TOOK TO HER BED AND LEFT THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS TO HER DIXON TRUE TO HER POST OF BODY GUARD ATTENDED MOST FAITHFULLY TO HER MISTRESS
1678-142279-0091 HELSTONE MISTER HALE'S SUCCESSOR IN THE LIVING WAS APPOINTED AND AT ANY RATE AFTER HER FATHER'S DECISION THERE MUST BE NO LINGERING NOW FOR HIS SAKE AS WELL AS FROM EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION
1678-142279-0092 FOR HE CAME HOME EVERY EVENING MORE AND MORE DEPRESSED AFTER THE NECESSARY LEAVE TAKING WHICH HE HAD RESOLVED TO HAVE WITH EVERY INDIVIDUAL PARISHIONER
1678-142279-0093 MARGARET INEXPERIENCED AS SHE WAS IN ALL THE NECESSARY MATTER OF FACT BUSINESS TO BE GOT THROUGH DID NOT KNOW TO WHOM TO APPLY FOR ADVICE THE COOK AND CHARLOTTE WORKED AWAY WITH WILLING ARMS AND STOUT HEARTS AT ALL THE MOVING AND PACKING AND AS FAR AS THAT WENT
1678-142279-0094 MARGARET'S ADMIRABLE SENSE ENABLED HER TO SEE WHAT WAS BEST AND TO DIRECT HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE BUT WHERE WERE THEY TO GO TO IN A WEEK THEY MUST BE GONE STRAIGHT TO MILTON OR WHERE
1678-142279-0095 SO MANY ARRANGEMENTS DEPENDED ON THIS DECISION THAT MARGARET RESOLVED TO ASK HER FATHER ONE EVENING IN SPITE OF HIS EVIDENT FATIGUE AND LOW SPIRITS HE ANSWERED MY DEAR
1678-142279-0096 I HAVE REALLY HAD TOO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT TO SETTLE THIS WHAT DOES YOUR MOTHER SAY WHAT DOES SHE WISH
1678-142279-0097 DIXON HAD JUST COME INTO THE ROOM FOR ANOTHER CUP OF TEA FOR MISSUS HALE AND CATCHING MISTER HALE'S LAST WORDS AND PROTECTED BY HIS PRESENCE FROM MARGARET'S UPBRAIDING EYES MADE BOLD TO SAY MY POOR MISTRESS
1678-142279-0098 YOU DON'T THINK HER WORSE TO DAY SAID MISTER HALE TURNING HASTILY I'M SURE I CAN'T SAY SIR IT'S NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE
1678-142279-0099 MISTER HALE LOOKED INFINITELY DISTRESSED YOU HAD BETTER TAKE MAMMA HER TEA WHILE IT IS HOT DIXON SAID MARGARET IN A TONE OF QUIET AUTHORITY
1678-142279-0100 OH I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS MY THOUGHTS WAS OTHERWISE OCCUPIED IN THINKING OF MY POOR OF MISSUS HALE PAPA SAID MARGARET IT IS THIS SUSPENSE THAT IS BAD FOR YOU BOTH
1678-142279-0101 BUT NOW THE COURSE IS CLEAR AT LEAST TO A CERTAIN POINT AND I THINK PAPA THAT I COULD GET MAMMA TO HELP ME IN PLANNING IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT TO PLAN FOR
1678-142279-0102 SHE HAS NEVER EXPRESSED ANY WISH IN ANY WAY AND ONLY THINKS OF WHAT CAN'T BE HELPED
1678-142279-0103 HAVE YOU TAKEN A HOUSE THERE NO HE REPLIED I SUPPOSE WE MUST GO INTO LODGINGS AND LOOK ABOUT FOR A HOUSE AND PACK UP THE FURNITURE SO THAT IT
1678-142279-0104 CAN BE LEFT AT THE RAILWAY STATION TILL WE HAVE MET WITH ONE I SUPPOSE SO DO WHAT YOU THINK BEST ONLY REMEMBER WE SHALL HAVE MUCH LESS MONEY TO SPEND
1678-142279-0105 THEY HAD NEVER HAD MUCH SUPERFLUITY AS MARGARET KNEW SHE FELT THAT IT WAS A GREAT WEIGHT SUDDENLY THROWN UPON HER SHOULDERS FOUR MONTHS AGO ALL THE DECISIONS SHE NEEDED TO MAKE WERE WHAT DRESS SHE WOULD WEAR FOR DINNER AND
1678-142279-0106 TO HELP EDITH TO DRAW OUT THE LISTS OF WHO SHOULD TAKE DOWN WHOM IN THE DINNER PARTIES AT HOME NOR WAS THE HOUSEHOLD IN WHICH SHE LIVED ONE THAT CALLED FOR MUCH DECISION EXCEPT IN THE ONE GRAND CASE OF CAPTAIN LENNOX'S OFFER
1678-142279-0107 EVERYTHING WENT ON WITH THE REGULARITY OF CLOCKWORK ONCE A YEAR THERE WAS A LONG DISCUSSION BETWEEN HER AUNT AND EDITH AS TO WHETHER THEY SHOULD GO TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT ABROAD OR TO SCOTLAND BUT AT SUCH TIMES MARGARET HERSELF WAS SECURE OF DRIFTING WITHOUT ANY
1678-142279-0108 EXERTION OF HER OWN INTO THE QUIET HARBOUR OF HOME NOW SINCE THAT DAY WHEN MISTER LENNOX CAME AND STARTLED HER INTO A DECISION EVERY DAY BROUGHT SOME QUESTION MOMENTOUS TO HER
1678-142279-0109 AND TO THOSE WHOM SHE LOVED TO BE SETTLED HER FATHER WENT UP AFTER TEA TO SIT WITH HIS WIFE MARGARET REMAINED ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM SUDDENLY SHE TOOK A CANDLE AND WENT INTO HER FATHER'S STUDY FOR A GREAT ATLAS AND LUGGING IT BACK INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
1678-142279-0110 SHE BEGAN TO PORE OVER THE MAP OF ENGLAND SHE WAS READY TO LOOK UP BRIGHTLY WHEN HER FATHER CAME DOWN STAIRS I HAVE HIT UPON SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLAN LOOK HERE IN DARKSHIRE HARDLY THE BREADTH OF MY FINGER FROM MILTON
1678-142279-0111 IS HESTON WHICH I HAVE OFTEN HEARD OF FROM PEOPLE LIVING IN THE NORTH AS SUCH A PLEASANT LITTLE BATHING PLACE NOW DON'T YOU THINK WE COULD GET MAMMA THERE WITH DIXON WHILE YOU AND I GO AND LOOK AT HOUSES AND GET ONE ALL READY FOR HER IN MILTON
1678-142279-0112 SHE WOULD GET A BREATH OF SEA AIR TO SET HER UP FOR THE WINTER AND BE SPARED ALL THE FATIGUE AND DIXON WOULD ENJOY TAKING CARE OF HER IS DIXON TO GO WITH US
1678-142279-0113 DISMAY OH YES SAID MARGARET DIXON QUITE INTENDS IT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAMMA WOULD DO WITHOUT HER
1678-142279-0114 TO BE SURE SHE DOES PAPA REPLIED MARGARET AND IF SHE HAS TO PUT UP WITH A DIFFERENT STYLE OF LIVING WE SHALL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH HER AIRS WHICH WILL BE WORSE BUT SHE REALLY LOVES US ALL AND WOULD BE MISERABLE TO LEAVE US
1678-142279-0115 SO FOR MAMMA'S SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF HER FAITHFULNESS I DO THINK SHE MUST GO VERY WELL MY DEAR GO ON I AM RESIGNED HOW FAR IS HESTON FROM MILTON
1678-142279-0116 NOT IN DISTANCE BUT IN NEVER MIND IF YOU REALLY THINK IT WILL DO YOUR MOTHER GOOD LET IT BE FIXED SO THIS WAS A GREAT STEP
1678-142279-0117 NOW MARGARET COULD WORK AND ACT AND PLAN IN GOOD EARNEST AND NOW MISSUS HALE COULD ROUSE HERSELF FROM HER LANGUOR AND FORGET HER REAL SUFFERING IN THINKING OF THE PLEASURE AND THE DELIGHT OF GOING TO THE SEA SIDE
1678-142279-0118 HER ONLY REGRET WAS THAT MISTER HALE COULD NOT BE WITH HER ALL THE FORTNIGHT SHE WAS TO BE THERE
