3793-10684-0000 AFTER I HAD SALUTED HIM THE CALIPH SAID I HAVE SENT FOR YOU SINDBAD BECAUSE I NEED YOUR SERVICES
3793-10684-0001 COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I ANSWERED I AM READY TO DO ALL THAT YOUR MAJESTY COMMANDS BUT I HUMBLY PRAY YOU TO REMEMBER THAT I AM UTTERLY DISHEARTENED BY THE UNHEARD OF SUFFERINGS I HAVE UNDERGONE INDEED I HAVE MADE A VOW
3793-10684-0002 NEVER AGAIN TO LEAVE BAGDAD WITH THIS I GAVE HIM A LONG ACCOUNT OF SOME OF MY STRANGEST ADVENTURES TO WHICH HE LISTENED PATIENTLY I ADMIT SAID HE THAT YOU HAVE INDEED HAD SOME EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES
3793-10684-0003 SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT I DECLARED MYSELF WILLING TO OBEY AND THE CALIPH DELIGHTED AT HAVING GOT HIS OWN WAY GAVE ME A THOUSAND SEQUINS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE VOYAGE I WAS SOON READY TO START AND TAKING THE LETTER AND THE PRESENT I EMBARKED AT BALSORA
3793-10684-0004 AFTER THANKING HIM FOR THE HONOUR THAT HE DID ME I DISPLAYED THE CALIPH'S GIFTS FIRST A BED WITH COMPLETE HANGINGS ALL CLOTH OF GOLD WHICH COST A THOUSAND SEQUINS AND ANOTHER LIKE TO IT OF CRIMSON STUFF FIFTY ROBES OF RICH EMBROIDERY
3793-10684-0005 A HUNDRED OF THE FINEST WHITE LINEN FROM CAIRO SUEZ CUFA AND ALEXANDRIA THEN MORE BEDS OF DIFFERENT FASHION AND AN AGATE VASE CARVED WITH THE FIGURE OF A MAN AIMING AN ARROW AT A LION AND FINALLY A COSTLY TABLE
3793-10684-0006 AND NOW MY TASK BEING ACCOMPLISHED I WAS ANXIOUS TO DEPART
3793-10684-0007 AND MAKING PRISONERS OF THOSE WHO WERE PRUDENT ENOUGH TO SUBMIT AT ONCE OF WHOM I WAS ONE WHEN THEY HAD DESPOILED US OF ALL WE POSSESSED THEY FORCED US TO PUT ON VILE RAIMENT AND SAILING TO A DISTANT ISLAND THERE SOLD US FOR SLAVES
3793-10684-0008 I FELL INTO THE HANDS OF A RICH MERCHANT WHO TOOK ME HOME WITH HIM AND CLOTHED AND FED ME WELL AND AFTER SOME DAYS SENT FOR ME AND QUESTIONED ME AS TO WHAT I COULD DO I ANSWERED THAT I WAS A RICH MERCHANT WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY PIRATES AND THEREFORE I KNEW NO TRADE
3793-10684-0009 TELL ME SAID HE CAN YOU SHOOT WITH A BOW
3793-10684-0010 SO SAYING HE GAVE ME A SUPPLY OF FOOD AND RETURNED TO THE TOWN AND I PERCHED MYSELF HIGH UP IN THE TREE AND KEPT WATCH THAT NIGHT I SAW NOTHING BUT JUST AFTER SUNRISE THE NEXT MORNING A LARGE HERD OF ELEPHANTS CAME CRASHING AND TRAMPLING BY
3793-10684-0011 AND THE OTHERS RETREATED LEAVING ME FREE TO COME DOWN FROM MY HIDING PLACE AND RUN BACK TO TELL MY MASTER OF MY SUCCESS FOR WHICH I WAS PRAISED AND REGALED WITH GOOD THINGS THEN WE WENT BACK TO THE FOREST TOGETHER AND DUG A MIGHTY TRENCH IN WHICH WE BURIED THE ELEPHANT I HAD KILLED IN ORDER
3793-10684-0012 THAT WHEN IT BECAME A SKELETON MY MASTER MIGHT RETURN AND SECURE ITS TUSKS FOR TWO MONTHS I HUNTED THUS AND NO DAY PASSED WITHOUT MY SECURING AN ELEPHANT OF COURSE I DID NOT ALWAYS STATION MYSELF IN THE SAME TREE BUT SOMETIMES IN ONE PLACE SOMETIMES IN ANOTHER
3793-10684-0013 I HAD INDEED GOOD REASON FOR MY TERROR WHEN AN INSTANT LATER THE LARGEST OF THE ANIMALS WOUND HIS TRUNK ROUND THE STEM OF MY TREE AND WITH ONE MIGHTY EFFORT TORE IT UP BY THE ROOTS BRINGING ME TO THE GROUND ENTANGLED IN ITS BRANCHES
3793-10684-0014 BEFORE I WAS ONCE MORE SET UPON MY FEET BY THE ELEPHANT AND I STOOD AS IF IN A DREAM WATCHING THE HERD
3793-10684-0015 THEN RECOVERING MYSELF I LOOKED ABOUT ME AND FOUND THAT I WAS STANDING UPON THE SIDE OF A GREAT HILL STREWN AS FAR AS I COULD SEE ON EITHER HAND WITH BONES AND TUSKS OF ELEPHANTS
3793-10684-0016 THIS THEN MUST BE THE ELEPHANTS BURYING PLACE I SAID TO MYSELF AND THEY MUST HAVE BROUGHT ME HERE THAT I MIGHT CEASE TO PERSECUTE THEM SEEING THAT I WANT NOTHING BUT THEIR TUSKS AND HERE LIE MORE THAN I COULD CARRY AWAY IN A LIFETIME
3793-10684-0017 WHEREUPON I TURNED AND MADE FOR THE CITY AS FAST AS I COULD GO NOT SEEING A SINGLE ELEPHANT BY THE WAY WHICH CONVINCED ME THAT THEY HAD RETIRED DEEPER INTO THE FOREST TO LEAVE THE WAY OPEN TO THE IVORY HILL AND I DID NOT KNOW HOW SUFFICIENTLY TO ADMIRE THEIR SAGACITY
3793-10684-0018 AH POOR SINDBAD HE CRIED I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD HAVE BECOME OF YOU WHEN I WENT TO THE FOREST I FOUND THE TREE NEWLY UPROOTED AND THE ARROWS LYING BESIDE IT AND I FEARED I SHOULD NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN PRAY
3793-10684-0019 WHEN WE HAD LOADED OUR ELEPHANT WITH AS MANY TUSKS AS IT COULD CARRY AND WERE ON OUR WAY BACK TO THE CITY HE SAID MY BROTHER SINCE I CAN NO LONGER TREAT AS A SLAVE ONE WHO HAS ENRICHED ME THUS TAKE YOUR LIBERTY AND MAY HEAVEN PROSPER YOU I WILL NO LONGER CONCEAL FROM YOU
3793-10684-0020 YOU ALONE HAVE ESCAPED THE WILES OF THESE ANIMALS THEREFORE YOU MUST BE UNDER THE SPECIAL PROTECTION OF HEAVEN NOW THROUGH YOU THE WHOLE TOWN WILL BE ENRICHED WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF LIFE THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT ONLY RECEIVE YOUR LIBERTY BUT I WILL ALSO BESTOW A FORTUNE UPON YOU
3793-10684-0021 TO WHICH I REPLIED MASTER I THANK YOU AND WISH YOU ALL PROSPERITY FOR MYSELF I ONLY ASK LIBERTY TO RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY IT IS WELL HE ANSWERED THE MONSOON WILL SOON BRING THE IVORY SHIPS HITHER THEN I WILL SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH SOMEWHAT TO PAY YOUR PASSAGE
3793-10684-0022 SO I STAYED WITH HIM TILL THE TIME OF THE MONSOON AND EVERY DAY WE ADDED TO OUR STORE OF IVORY TILL ALL HIS WARE HOUSES WERE OVERFLOWING WITH IT BY THIS TIME THE OTHER MERCHANTS KNEW THE SECRET BUT THERE WAS ENOUGH AND TO SPARE FOR ALL
3793-10684-0023 WHEN THE SHIPS AT LAST ARRIVED MY MASTER HIMSELF CHOSE THE ONE IN WHICH I WAS TO SAIL AND PUT ON BOARD FOR ME A GREAT STORE OF CHOICE PROVISIONS ALSO IVORY IN ABUNDANCE AND ALL THE COSTLIEST CURIOSITIES OF THE COUNTRY FOR WHICH I COULD NOT THANK HIM ENOUGH
3793-10684-0024 AND SO WE PARTED I LEFT THE SHIP AT THE FIRST PORT WE CAME TO NOT FEELING AT EASE UPON THE SEA AFTER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME BY REASON OF IT AND HAVING DISPOSED OF MY IVORY FOR MUCH GOLD AND BOUGHT MANY RARE AND COSTLY PRESENTS
3793-10684-0025 I LOADED MY PACK ANIMALS AND JOINED A CARAVAN OF MERCHANTS OUR JOURNEY WAS LONG AND TEDIOUS BUT I BORE IT PATIENTLY
3793-10684-0026 FROM WHICH I HAD SUFFERED BEFORE AND AT LENGTH WE REACHED BAGDAD MY FIRST CARE WAS TO PRESENT MYSELF BEFORE THE CALIPH AND GIVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF MY EMBASSY HE ASSURED ME THAT MY LONG ABSENCE HAD DISQUIETED HIM MUCH BUT HE HAD NEVERTHELESS HOPED FOR THE BEST
3793-10684-0027 AS TO MY ADVENTURE AMONG THE ELEPHANTS HE HEARD IT WITH AMAZEMENT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT HAD NOT MY TRUTHFULNESS BEEN WELL KNOWN TO HIM BY HIS ORDERS THIS STORY AND THE OTHERS I HAD TOLD HIM WERE WRITTEN BY HIS SCRIBES IN LETTERS OF GOLD AND LAID UP AMONG HIS TREASURES
3793-10684-0028 I TOOK MY LEAVE OF HIM WELL SATISFIED WITH THE HONOURS AND REWARDS HE BESTOWED UPON ME AND SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE RESTED FROM MY LABOURS AND GIVEN MYSELF UP WHOLLY TO MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS THUS SINDBAD ENDED THE STORY OF HIS SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE
3793-10684-0029 AND TURNING TO HINDBAD HE ADDED WELL MY FRIEND AND WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW
3793-10684-0030 IS IT NOT JUST THAT I SHOULD NOW ENJOY A LIFE OF EASE AND TRANQUILLITY
