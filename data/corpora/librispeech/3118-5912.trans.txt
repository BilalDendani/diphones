3118-5912-0000 OF IDEAS THEIR ORIGIN COMPOSITION
3118-5912-0001 AND IDEAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWIXT THESE CONSISTS IN THE DEGREES OF FORCE AND LIVELINESS WITH WHICH THEY STRIKE UPON THE MIND AND MAKE THEIR WAY INTO OUR THOUGHT OR CONSCIOUSNESS
3118-5912-0002 THOSE PERCEPTIONS WHICH ENTER WITH MOST FORCE AND VIOLENCE WE MAY NAME IMPRESSIONS AND UNDER THIS NAME I COMPREHEND ALL OUR SENSATIONS PASSIONS AND EMOTIONS
3118-5912-0003 AS THEY MAKE THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE SOUL BY IDEAS I MEAN THE FAINT IMAGES OF THESE IN THINKING AND REASONING SUCH AS FOR INSTANCE ARE ALL THE PERCEPTIONS EXCITED BY THE PRESENT DISCOURSE
3118-5912-0004 IN EXPLAINING THIS DISTINCTION EVERY ONE OF HIMSELF WILL READILY PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWIXT FEELING AND THINKING THE COMMON DEGREES OF THESE ARE EASILY DISTINGUISHED THOUGH IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
3118-5912-0005 OUR IDEAS MAY APPROACH TO OUR IMPRESSIONS AS ON THE OTHER HAND IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT OUR IMPRESSIONS ARE SO FAINT AND LOW THAT WE CANNOT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM OUR IDEAS
3118-5912-0006 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS NEAR RESEMBLANCE IN A FEW INSTANCES THEY ARE IN GENERAL SO VERY DIFFERENT THAT NO ONE CAN MAKE A SCRUPLE TO RANK THEM UNDER DISTINCT HEADS AND ASSIGN TO EACH A PECULIAR NAME
3118-5912-0007 I HERE MAKE USE OF THESE TERMS IMPRESSION AND IDEA IN A SENSE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS USUAL AND I HOPE THIS LIBERTY WILL BE ALLOWED ME PERHAPS I RATHER RESTORE THE WORD IDEA
3118-5912-0008 IN WHICH OUR LIVELY PERCEPTIONS ARE PRODUCED IN THE SOUL BUT MERELY THE PERCEPTIONS THEMSELVES FOR WHICH THERE IS NO PARTICULAR NAME EITHER IN THE ENGLISH OR ANY OTHER LANGUAGE THAT I KNOW OF
3118-5912-0009 THERE IS ANOTHER DIVISION OF OUR PERCEPTIONS WHICH IT WILL BE CONVENIENT TO OBSERVE AND WHICH EXTENDS ITSELF BOTH TO OUR IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS THIS DIVISION IS INTO SIMPLE AND COMPLEX
3118-5912-0010 SIMPLE PERCEPTIONS OR IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS ARE SUCH AS ADMIT OF NO DISTINCTION NOR SEPARATION THE COMPLEX ARE THE CONTRARY TO THESE AND MAY BE DISTINGUISHED INTO PARTS
3118-5912-0011 TASTE AND SMELL ARE QUALITIES ALL UNITED TOGETHER IN THIS APPLE IT IS EASY TO PERCEIVE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME BUT ARE AT LEAST DISTINGUISHABLE FROM EACH OTHER
3118-5912-0012 HAVING BY THESE DIVISIONS GIVEN AN ORDER AND ARRANGEMENT TO OUR OBJECTS WE MAY NOW APPLY OURSELVES TO CONSIDER WITH THE MORE ACCURACY THEIR QUALITIES AND RELATIONS
3118-5912-0013 THE FIRST CIRCUMSTANCE THAT STRIKES MY EYE IS THE GREAT RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT OUR IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS IN EVERY OTHER PARTICULAR EXCEPT THEIR DEGREE OF FORCE AND VIVACITY
3118-5912-0014 THE ONE SEEM TO BE IN A MANNER THE REFLEXION OF THE OTHER SO THAT ALL THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE MIND ARE DOUBLE AND APPEAR BOTH AS IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS
3118-5912-0015 WHEN I SHUT MY EYES AND THINK OF MY CHAMBER THE IDEAS I FORM ARE EXACT REPRESENTATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS I FELT NOR IS THERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE ONE WHICH IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE OTHER
3118-5912-0016 IN RUNNING OVER MY OTHER PERCEPTIONS I FIND STILL THE SAME RESEMBLANCE AND REPRESENTATION IDEAS AND IMPRESSIONS APPEAR ALWAYS TO CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER
3118-5912-0017 AND THAT I MUST MAKE USE OF THE DISTINCTION OF PERCEPTIONS INTO SIMPLE AND COMPLEX TO LIMIT THIS GENERAL DECISION THAT ALL OUR IDEAS AND IMPRESSIONS ARE RESEMBLING
3118-5912-0018 I OBSERVE THAT MANY OF OUR COMPLEX IDEAS NEVER HAD IMPRESSIONS THAT CORRESPONDED TO THEM AND THAT MANY OF OUR COMPLEX IMPRESSIONS NEVER ARE EXACTLY COPIED IN IDEAS
3118-5912-0019 I CAN FORM SUCH AN IDEA OF THAT CITY AS WILL PERFECTLY REPRESENT ALL ITS STREETS AND HOUSES IN THEIR REAL AND JUST PROPORTIONS I PERCEIVE THEREFORE
3118-5912-0020 THAT THOUGH THERE IS IN GENERAL A GREAT RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT OUR COMPLEX IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS YET THE RULE IS NOT UNIVERSALLY TRUE THAT THEY ARE EXACT COPIES OF EACH OTHER
3118-5912-0021 BY A PARTICULAR ENUMERATION OF THEM EVERY ONE MAY SATISFY HIMSELF IN THIS POINT BY RUNNING OVER AS MANY AS HE PLEASES BUT IF ANY ONE SHOULD DENY THIS UNIVERSAL RESEMBLANCE
3118-5912-0022 IF HE DOES NOT ANSWER THIS CHALLENGE AS IT IS CERTAIN HE CANNOT WE MAY FROM HIS SILENCE AND OUR OWN OBSERVATION ESTABLISH OUR CONCLUSION THUS WE FIND
3118-5912-0023 THAT ALL SIMPLE IDEAS AND IMPRESSIONS RESEMBLE EACH OTHER AND AS THE COMPLEX ARE FORMED FROM THEM WE MAY AFFIRM IN GENERAL THAT THESE TWO SPECIES OF PERCEPTION ARE EXACTLY CORRESPONDENT
3118-5912-0024 HAVING DISCOVERED THIS RELATION WHICH REQUIRES NO FARTHER EXAMINATION I AM CURIOUS TO FIND SOME OTHER OF THEIR QUALITIES LET US CONSIDER HOW THEY STAND WITH REGARD TO THEIR EXISTENCE
3118-5912-0025 AND WHICH OF THE IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS ARE CAUSES AND WHICH EFFECTS THE FULL EXAMINATION OF THIS QUESTION IS THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT TREATISE AND THEREFORE WE SHALL HERE CONTENT OURSELVES
3118-5912-0026 REPRESENT IN SEEKING FOR PHENOMENA TO PROVE THIS PROPOSITION I FIND ONLY THOSE OF TWO KINDS BUT IN EACH KIND THE PHENOMENA ARE OBVIOUS NUMEROUS AND CONCLUSIVE
3118-5912-0027 I FIRST MAKE MYSELF CERTAIN BY A NEW REVIEW OF WHAT I HAVE ALREADY ASSERTED THAT EVERY SIMPLE IMPRESSION IS ATTENDED WITH A CORRESPONDENT IDEA AND EVERY SIMPLE IDEA
3118-5912-0028 BUT CLEARLY PROVES A DEPENDENCE OF THE IMPRESSIONS ON THE IDEAS OR OF THE IDEAS ON THE IMPRESSIONS THAT I MAY KNOW ON WHICH SIDE THIS DEPENDENCE LIES
3118-5912-0029 I CONSIDER THE ORDER OF THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE AND FIND BY CONSTANT EXPERIENCE THAT THE SIMPLE IMPRESSIONS ALWAYS TAKE THE PRECEDENCE OF THEIR CORRESPONDENT IDEAS BUT NEVER APPEAR IN THE CONTRARY ORDER
3118-5912-0030 TO GIVE A CHILD AN IDEA OF SCARLET OR ORANGE OF SWEET OR BITTER I PRESENT THE OBJECTS OR IN OTHER WORDS CONVEY TO HIM THESE IMPRESSIONS BUT PROCEED NOT SO ABSURDLY
3118-5912-0031 AS TO ENDEAVOUR TO PRODUCE THE IMPRESSIONS BY EXCITING THE IDEAS OUR IDEAS UPON THEIR APPEARANCE PRODUCE NOT THEIR CORRESPONDENT IMPRESSIONS
3118-5912-0032 AND IS ONLY DIFFERENT IN THE DEGREES OF FORCE AND LIVELINESS THE CONSTANT CONJUNCTION OF OUR RESEMBLING PERCEPTIONS IS A CONVINCING PROOF THAT THE ONE ARE THE CAUSES OF THE OTHER
3118-5912-0033 AND THIS PRIORITY OF THE IMPRESSIONS IS AN EQUAL PROOF THAT OUR IMPRESSIONS ARE THE CAUSES OF OUR IDEAS NOT OUR IDEAS OF OUR IMPRESSIONS TO CONFIRM THIS
3118-5912-0034 I CONSIDER ANOTHER PLAIN AND CONVINCING PHAENOMENON WHICH IS THAT WHERE EVER BY ANY ACCIDENT THE FACULTIES WHICH GIVE RISE TO ANY IMPRESSIONS ARE OBSTRUCTED IN THEIR OPERATIONS
3118-5912-0035 AS WHEN ONE IS BORN BLIND OR DEAF NOT ONLY THE IMPRESSIONS ARE LOST BUT ALSO THEIR CORRESPONDENT IDEAS SO THAT THERE NEVER APPEAR IN THE MIND THE LEAST TRACES OF EITHER OF THEM
3118-5912-0036 NOR IS THIS ONLY TRUE WHERE THE ORGANS OF SENSATION ARE ENTIRELY DESTROYED BUT LIKEWISE WHERE THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN PUT IN ACTION TO PRODUCE A PARTICULAR IMPRESSION
3118-5912-0037 WE CANNOT FORM TO OURSELVES A JUST IDEA OF THE TASTE OF A PINE APPLE WITHOUT HAVING ACTUALLY TASTED IT THERE IS HOWEVER ONE CONTRADICTORY PHAENOMENON
3118-5912-0038 WHICH MAY PROVE THAT IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR IDEAS TO GO BEFORE THEIR CORRESPONDENT IMPRESSIONS I BELIEVE IT WILL READILY BE ALLOWED THAT THE SEVERAL DISTINCT IDEAS OF COLOURS WHICH ENTER BY THE EYES
3118-5912-0039 OR THOSE OF SOUNDS WHICH ARE CONVEYED BY THE HEARING ARE REALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME RESEMBLING NOW IF THIS BE TRUE OF DIFFERENT COLOURS IT MUST BE NO LESS SO
3118-5912-0040 EXCEPT THAT SINGLE ONE BE PLACED BEFORE HIM DESCENDING GRADUALLY FROM THE DEEPEST TO THE LIGHTEST IT IS PLAIN THAT HE WILL PERCEIVE A BLANK
3118-5912-0041 THAT THERE IS A GREATER DISTANCE IN THAT PLACE BETWIXT THE CONTIGUOUS COLOURS THAN IN ANY OTHER NOW I ASK WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE FOR HIM FROM HIS OWN IMAGINATION TO SUPPLY THIS DEFICIENCY
3118-5912-0042 AND RAISE UP TO HIMSELF THE IDEA OF THAT PARTICULAR SHADE THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN CONVEYED TO HIM BY HIS SENSES I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW BUT WILL BE OF OPINION THAT HE CAN AND THIS MAY SERVE AS A PROOF
3118-5912-0043 THAT THE SIMPLE IDEAS ARE NOT ALWAYS DERIVED FROM THE CORRESPONDENT IMPRESSIONS THOUGH THE INSTANCE IS SO PARTICULAR AND SINGULAR THAT IT IS SCARCE WORTH OUR OBSERVING AND DOES NOT MERIT THAT FOR IT ALONE
3118-5912-0044 THAT AS OUR IDEAS ARE IMAGES OF OUR IMPRESSIONS SO WE CAN FORM SECONDARY IDEAS WHICH ARE IMAGES OF THE PRIMARY AS APPEARS FROM THIS VERY REASONING CONCERNING THEM
3118-5912-0045 BUT AS THE FIRST IDEAS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DERIVED FROM IMPRESSIONS IT STILL REMAINS TRUE THAT ALL OUR SIMPLE IDEAS PROCEED EITHER MEDIATELY
3118-5912-0046 FROM THEIR CORRESPONDENT IMPRESSIONS THIS THEN IS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE I ESTABLISH IN THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN NATURE NOR OUGHT WE TO DESPISE IT BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF ITS APPEARANCE
3118-5912-0047 FOR IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE PRESENT QUESTION CONCERNING THE PRECEDENCY OF OUR IMPRESSIONS OR IDEAS IS THE SAME WITH WHAT HAS MADE SO MUCH NOISE IN OTHER TERMS WHEN IT HAS BEEN DISPUTED
3118-5912-0048 WHETHER THERE BE ANY INNATE IDEAS OR WHETHER ALL IDEAS BE DERIVED FROM SENSATION AND REFLEXION WE MAY OBSERVE THAT IN ORDER TO PROVE THE IDEAS OF EXTENSION AND COLOUR
3118-5912-0049 THEY OBSERVE THAT WE HAVE A PRECEDING EXPERIENCE OF THESE EMOTIONS IN OURSELVES NOW IF WE CAREFULLY EXAMINE THESE ARGUMENTS WE SHALL FIND THAT THEY PROVE NOTHING
