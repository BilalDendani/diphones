70-121127-0000 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVEN THE LIONS DEN ONE DIVISION OF LA FORCE IN WHICH THE MOST DANGEROUS AND DESPERATE PRISONERS ARE CONFINED IS CALLED THE COURT OF SAINT BERNARD THE PRISONERS IN THEIR EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE HAVE NAMED IT THE LIONS DEN
70-121127-0001 PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CAPTIVES POSSESS TEETH WHICH FREQUENTLY GNAW THE BARS AND SOMETIMES THE KEEPERS ALSO IT IS A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND
70-121127-0002 COLD PITILESS EXPRESSION PROVE THEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REIGN OVER THEIR SUBJECTS FOR THEIR SUPERIOR ACTIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE THE COURT YARD OF THIS QUARTER IS ENCLOSED BY ENORMOUS WALLS OVER WHICH THE SUN GLANCES OBLIQUELY WHEN IT DEIGNS TO PENETRATE INTO THIS GULF OF MORAL AND PHYSICAL DEFORMITY
70-121127-0003 ON THIS PAVED YARD ARE TO BE SEEN PACING TO AND FRO FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT PALE CAREWORN AND HAGGARD LIKE SO MANY SHADOWS THE MEN WHOM JUSTICE HOLDS BENEATH THE STEEL SHE IS SHARPENING
70-121127-0004 THERE CROUCHED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE WALL WHICH ATTRACTS AND RETAINS THE MOST HEAT THEY MAY BE SEEN SOMETIMES TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER BUT MORE FREQUENTLY ALONE WATCHING THE DOOR WHICH SOMETIMES OPENS TO CALL FORTH ONE FROM THE GLOOMY ASSEMBLAGE
70-121127-0005 OR TO THROW IN ANOTHER OUTCAST FROM SOCIETY THE COURT OF SAINT BERNARD HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR APARTMENT FOR THE RECEPTION OF GUESTS IT IS A LONG RECTANGLE DIVIDED BY TWO UPRIGHT GRATINGS PLACED AT A DISTANCE OF THREE FEET FROM ONE ANOTHER
70-121127-0006 TO PREVENT A VISITOR FROM SHAKING HANDS WITH OR PASSING ANYTHING TO THE PRISONERS IT IS A WRETCHED DAMP NAY EVEN HORRIBLE SPOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGONIZING CONFERENCES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE IRON BARS AND YET
70-121127-0007 FRIGHTFUL THOUGH THIS SPOT MAY BE IT IS LOOKED UPON AS A KIND OF PARADISE BY THE MEN WHOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED IT IS SO RARE FOR THEM TO LEAVE THE LIONS DEN FOR ANY OTHER PLACE
70-121127-0008 OR THE GALLEYS IN THE COURT WHICH WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE AND FROM WHICH A DAMP VAPOR WAS RISING A YOUNG MAN WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS WHO HAD EXCITED MUCH CURIOSITY AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE DEN MIGHT BE SEEN WALKING
70-121127-0009 THE CUT OF HIS CLOTHES WOULD HAVE MADE HIM PASS FOR AN ELEGANT MAN IF THOSE CLOTHES HAD NOT BEEN TORN TO SHREDS STILL THEY DID NOT SHOW SIGNS OF WEAR AND THE FINE CLOTH BENEATH THE CAREFUL HANDS OF THE PRISONER SOON RECOVERED ITS GLOSS IN THE PARTS WHICH WERE STILL PERFECT
70-121127-0010 FOR THE WEARER TRIED HIS BEST TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW COAT HE BESTOWED THE SAME ATTENTION UPON THE CAMBRIC FRONT OF A SHIRT WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN COLOR SINCE HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE PRISON
70-121127-0011 AND HE POLISHED HIS VARNISHED BOOTS WITH THE CORNER OF A HANDKERCHIEF EMBROIDERED WITH INITIALS SURMOUNTED BY A CORONET SOME OF THE INMATES OF THE LIONS DEN WERE WATCHING THE OPERATIONS OF THE PRISONER'S TOILET WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST
70-121127-0012 SEE THE PRINCE IS PLUMING HIMSELF SAID ONE OF THE THIEVES HE'S A FINE LOOKING FELLOW SAID ANOTHER IF HE HAD ONLY A COMB AND HAIR GREASE HE'D TAKE THE SHINE OFF THE GENTLEMEN IN WHITE KIDS HIS COAT LOOKS ALMOST NEW AND HIS BOOTS SHINE LIKE A NIGGER'S FACE IT'S PLEASANT TO HAVE SUCH WELL DRESSED COMRADES
70-121127-0013 HE LOOKS LIKE A BIG BUG SAID ANOTHER DRESSES IN FINE STYLE AND THEN TO BE HERE SO YOUNG OH WHAT LARKS MEANWHILE THE OBJECT OF THIS HIDEOUS ADMIRATION APPROACHED THE WICKET AGAINST WHICH ONE OF THE KEEPERS WAS LEANING
70-121127-0014 REMEMBER I HAVE RELATIONS WHO POSSESS MORE MILLIONS THAN YOU HAVE DENIERS COME I BESEECH YOU LEND ME TWENTY FRANCS SO THAT I MAY BUY A DRESSING GOWN IT IS INTOLERABLE ALWAYS TO BE IN A COAT AND BOOTS AND WHAT A COAT SIR FOR A PRINCE OF THE CAVALCANTI
70-121127-0015 THE KEEPER TURNED HIS BACK AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE DID NOT EVEN LAUGH AT WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED ANY ONE ELSE TO DO SO HE HAD HEARD SO MANY UTTER THE SAME THINGS INDEED HE HEARD NOTHING ELSE COME SAID ANDREA YOU ARE A MAN VOID OF COMPASSION
70-121127-0016 I'LL HAVE YOU TURNED OUT THIS MADE THE KEEPER TURN AROUND AND HE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH THE PRISONERS THEN APPROACHED AND FORMED A CIRCLE I TELL YOU THAT WITH THAT WRETCHED SUM CONTINUED ANDREA I COULD OBTAIN A COAT AND A ROOM IN WHICH TO RECEIVE THE ILLUSTRIOUS VISITOR I AM DAILY EXPECTING
70-121127-0017 OF COURSE OF COURSE SAID THE PRISONERS ANY ONE CAN SEE HE'S A GENTLEMAN
70-121127-0018 I AM NO COMRADE OF THESE PEOPLE SAID THE YOUNG MAN PROUDLY YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO INSULT ME THUS
70-121127-0019 THE LATTER SURE OF QUELLING THE TEMPEST WHEN THE WAVES BECAME TOO VIOLENT ALLOWED THEM TO RISE TO A CERTAIN PITCH THAT HE MIGHT BE REVENGED ON THE IMPORTUNATE ANDREA AND BESIDES IT WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME RECREATION DURING THE LONG DAY
70-121127-0020 THE THIEVES HAD ALREADY APPROACHED ANDREA SOME SCREAMING LA SAVATE LA SAVATE A CRUEL OPERATION WHICH CONSISTS IN CUFFING A COMRADE WHO MAY HAVE FALLEN INTO DISGRACE NOT WITH AN OLD SHOE BUT WITH AN IRON HEELED ONE
70-121127-0021 OTHERS PROPOSED THE ANGUILLE ANOTHER KIND OF RECREATION IN WHICH A HANDKERCHIEF IS FILLED WITH SAND PEBBLES AND TWO SOUS PIECES WHEN THEY HAVE THEM
70-121127-0022 THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS THROWN DOWN AND THE IRON HEELED SHOE REPLACED ON THE FOOT OF THE WRETCH TO WHOM IT BELONGED SOME VOICES WERE HEARD TO SAY THAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS RIGHT THAT HE INTENDED TO BE CIVIL IN HIS WAY AND THAT THEY WOULD SET THE EXAMPLE OF LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE AND THE MOB RETIRED
70-121127-0023 THE KEEPER WAS SO STUPEFIED AT THIS SCENE THAT HE TOOK ANDREA BY THE HANDS AND BEGAN EXAMINING HIS PERSON ATTRIBUTING THE SUDDEN SUBMISSION OF THE INMATES OF THE LIONS DEN TO SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN MERE FASCINATION
70-121127-0024 ANDREA MADE NO RESISTANCE ALTHOUGH HE PROTESTED AGAINST IT SUDDENLY A VOICE WAS HEARD AT THE WICKET BENEDETTO EXCLAIMED AN INSPECTOR THE KEEPER RELAXED HIS HOLD I AM CALLED SAID ANDREA TO THE VISITORS ROOM SAID THE SAME VOICE
70-121127-0025 YOU SEE SOME ONE PAYS ME A VISIT AH MY DEAR SIR YOU WILL SEE WHETHER A CAVALCANTI IS TO BE TREATED LIKE A COMMON PERSON AND ANDREA GLIDING THROUGH THE COURT LIKE A BLACK SHADOW RUSHED OUT THROUGH THE WICKET LEAVING HIS COMRADES AND EVEN THE KEEPER LOST IN WONDER
70-121127-0026 CERTAINLY A CALL TO THE VISITORS ROOM HAD SCARCELY ASTONISHED ANDREA LESS THAN THEMSELVES FOR THE WILY YOUTH INSTEAD OF MAKING USE OF HIS PRIVILEGE OF WAITING TO BE CLAIMED ON HIS ENTRY INTO LA FORCE HAD MAINTAINED A RIGID SILENCE
70-121127-0027 THIS SUDDEN FORTUNE THE FACILITY WITH WHICH I HAVE OVERCOME ALL OBSTACLES AN UNEXPECTED FAMILY AND AN ILLUSTRIOUS NAME AWARDED TO ME GOLD SHOWERED DOWN UPON ME
70-121127-0028 THE HAND WHICH HAS RETREATED FOR A WHILE WILL BE AGAIN STRETCHED FORTH TO SAVE ME AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I SHALL THINK MYSELF SINKING INTO THE ABYSS WHY SHOULD I RISK AN IMPRUDENT STEP IT MIGHT ALIENATE MY PROTECTOR HE HAS TWO MEANS OF EXTRICATING ME FROM THIS DILEMMA
70-121127-0029 THE ONE BY A MYSTERIOUS ESCAPE MANAGED THROUGH BRIBERY THE OTHER BY BUYING OFF MY JUDGES WITH GOLD I WILL SAY AND DO NOTHING UNTIL I AM CONVINCED THAT HE HAS QUITE ABANDONED ME AND THEN ANDREA HAD FORMED A PLAN WHICH WAS TOLERABLY CLEVER
70-121127-0030 THE UNFORTUNATE YOUTH WAS INTREPID IN THE ATTACK AND RUDE IN THE DEFENCE
70-121127-0031 STILL BY DEGREES NATURE OR RATHER CUSTOM HAD PREVAILED AND HE SUFFERED FROM BEING NAKED DIRTY AND HUNGRY IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT OF DISCOMFORT THAT THE INSPECTOR'S VOICE CALLED HIM TO THE VISITING ROOM ANDREA FELT HIS HEART LEAP WITH JOY
70-121127-0032 IT WAS TOO SOON FOR A VISIT FROM THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE AND TOO LATE FOR ONE FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE PRISON OR THE DOCTOR IT MUST THEN BE THE VISITOR HE HOPED FOR
70-121127-0033 HE SAW WHILE HIS EYES DILATED WITH SURPRISE
70-121127-0034 WHO WAS ALSO GAZING WITH SAD ASTONISHMENT UPON THE IRON BARS THE BOLTED DOORS AND THE SHADOW WHICH MOVED BEHIND THE OTHER GRATING AH SAID ANDREA DEEPLY AFFECTED GOOD MORNING BENEDETTO SAID BERTUCCIO WITH HIS DEEP HOLLOW VOICE
