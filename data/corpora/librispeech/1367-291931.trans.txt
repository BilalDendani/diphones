1367-291931-0000 THIS LITTLE COLLECTION DIFFERS IT IS BELIEVED FROM OTHERS IN THE ATTEMPT MADE TO INCLUDE IN IT ALL THE BEST ORIGINAL LYRICAL PIECES AND SONGS IN OUR LANGUAGE BY WRITERS NOT LIVING AND NONE BESIDE THE BEST
1367-291931-0001 MANY FAMILIAR VERSES WILL HENCE BE MET WITH MANY ALSO WHICH SHOULD BE FAMILIAR THE EDITOR WILL REGARD AS HIS FITTEST READERS THOSE WHO LOVE POETRY SO WELL THAT HE CAN OFFER THEM NOTHING NOT ALREADY KNOWN AND VALUED
1367-291931-0002 FOR THOSE WHO TAKE UP THE BOOK IN A SERIOUS AND SCHOLARLY SPIRIT THE FOLLOWING REMARKS ON THE PLAN AND THE EXECUTION ARE ADDED THE EDITOR IS ACQUAINTED WITH NO STRICT AND EXHAUSTIVE DEFINITION OF LYRICAL POETRY
1367-291931-0003 BUT HE HAS FOUND THE TASK OF PRACTICAL DECISION INCREASE IN CLEARNESS AND IN FACILITY AS HE ADVANCED WITH THE WORK WHILST KEEPING IN VIEW A FEW SIMPLE PRINCIPLES LYRICAL HAS BEEN HERE HELD ESSENTIALLY TO IMPLY
1367-291931-0004 THAT EACH POEM SHALL TURN ON SOME SINGLE THOUGHT FEELING OR SITUATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NARRATIVE DESCRIPTIVE AND DIDACTIC POEMS UNLESS ACCOMPANIED BY RAPIDITY OF MOVEMENT
1367-291931-0005 BREVITY AND THE COLOURING OF HUMAN PASSION HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED HUMOROUS POETRY EXCEPT IN THE VERY UNFREQUENT INSTANCES WHERE A TRULY POETICAL TONE PERVADES THE WHOLE
1367-291931-0006 WITH WHAT IS STRICTLY PERSONAL OCCASIONAL AND RELIGIOUS HAS BEEN CONSIDERED FOREIGN TO THE IDEA OF THE BOOK BLANK VERSE AND THE TEN SYLLABLE COUPLET WITH ALL PIECES MARKEDLY DRAMATIC
1367-291931-0007 HAVE BEEN REJECTED AS ALIEN FROM WHAT IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD BY SONG AND RARELY CONFORMING TO LYRICAL CONDITIONS IN TREATMENT BUT IT IS NOT ANTICIPATED NOR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL READERS SHALL THINK THE LINE ACCURATELY DRAWN
1367-291931-0008 SOME POEMS AS GRAY'S ELEGY THE ALLEGRO AND PENSEROSO WORDSWORTH'S RUTH
1367-291931-0009 MIGHT BE CLAIMED WITH PERHAPS EQUAL JUSTICE FOR A NARRATIVE OR DESCRIPTIVE SELECTION WHILST WITH REFERENCE ESPECIALLY TO BALLADS AND SONNETS THE EDITOR CAN ONLY STATE THAT HE HAS TAKEN HIS UTMOST PAINS TO DECIDE WITHOUT CAPRICE
1367-291931-0010 OR PARTIALITY THIS ALSO IS ALL HE CAN PLEAD IN REGARD TO A POINT EVEN MORE LIABLE TO QUESTION WHAT DEGREE OF MERIT SHOULD GIVE RANK AMONG THE BEST THAT A POEM SHALL BE WORTHY OF THE WRITER'S GENIUS
1367-291931-0011 THAT IT SHALL REACH A PERFECTION COMMENSURATE WITH ITS AIM THAT WE SHOULD REQUIRE FINISH IN PROPORTION TO BREVITY
1367-291931-0012 UNITY OR TRUTH THAT A FEW GOOD LINES DO NOT MAKE A GOOD POEM THAT POPULAR ESTIMATE IS SERVICEABLE AS A GUIDEPOST MORE THAN AS A COMPASS ABOVE ALL THAT EXCELLENCE SHOULD BE LOOKED FOR
1367-291931-0013 RATHER IN THE WHOLE THAN IN THE PARTS SUCH AND OTHER SUCH CANONS HAVE BEEN ALWAYS STEADILY REGARDED HE MAY HOWEVER ADD THAT THE PIECES CHOSEN AND A FAR LARGER NUMBER REJECTED
1367-291931-0014 HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY AND REPEATEDLY CONSIDERED AND THAT HE HAS BEEN AIDED THROUGHOUT BY TWO FRIENDS OF INDEPENDENT AND EXERCISED JUDGMENT BESIDES THE DISTINGUISHED PERSON ADDRESSED IN THE DEDICATION IT IS HOPED THAT BY THIS PROCEDURE
1367-291931-0015 THE VOLUME HAS BEEN FREED FROM THAT ONE SIDEDNESS WHICH MUST BESET INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS BUT FOR THE FINAL CHOICE THE EDITOR IS ALONE RESPONSIBLE CHALMERS VAST COLLECTION WITH THE WHOLE WORKS OF ALL ACCESSIBLE POETS

1367-291931-0017 THE POEMS ARE PRINTED ENTIRE EXCEPT IN A VERY FEW INSTANCES SPECIFIED IN THE NOTES WHERE A STANZA HAS BEEN OMITTED THE OMISSIONS HAVE BEEN RISKED ONLY WHEN THE PIECE COULD BE THUS BROUGHT TO A CLOSER LYRICAL UNITY
1367-291931-0018 AND AS ESSENTIALLY OPPOSED TO THIS UNITY EXTRACTS OBVIOUSLY SUCH ARE EXCLUDED IN REGARD TO THE TEXT THE PURPOSE OF THE BOOK HAS APPEARED TO JUSTIFY THE CHOICE OF THE MOST POETICAL VERSION
1367-291931-0019 WHEREVER MORE THAN ONE EXISTS AND MUCH LABOUR HAS BEEN GIVEN TO PRESENT EACH POEM IN DISPOSITION SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE IN THE ARRANGEMENT THE MOST POETICALLY EFFECTIVE ORDER HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED
1367-291931-0020 THE ENGLISH MIND HAS PASSED THROUGH PHASES OF THOUGHT AND CULTIVATION SO VARIOUS AND SO OPPOSED DURING THESE THREE CENTURIES OF POETRY THAT A RAPID PASSAGE BETWEEN OLD AND NEW
1367-291931-0021 LIKE RAPID ALTERATION OF THE EYE'S FOCUS IN LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE WILL ALWAYS BE WEARISOME AND HURTFUL TO THE SENSE OF BEAUTY THE POEMS HAVE BEEN THEREFORE DISTRIBUTED INTO BOOKS CORRESPONDING
1367-291931-0022 TO THE NINETY YEARS CLOSING ABOUT SIXTEEN SIXTEEN TWO THENCE TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED THREE TO EIGHTEEN HUNDRED
1367-291931-0023 OR LOOKING AT THE POETS WHO MORE OR LESS GIVE EACH PORTION ITS DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER THEY MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOOKS OF SHAKESPEARE MILTON GRAY AND WORDSWORTH THE VOLUME IN THIS RESPECT
1367-291931-0024 SO FAR AS THE LIMITATIONS OF ITS RANGE ALLOW ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE NATURAL GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF OUR POETRY A RIGIDLY CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE HOWEVER RATHER FITS A COLLECTION AIMING AT INSTRUCTION THAN AT PLEASURE
1367-291931-0025 AND THE WISDOM WHICH COMES THROUGH PLEASURE WITHIN EACH BOOK THE PIECES HAVE THEREFORE BEEN ARRANGED IN GRADATIONS OF FEELING OR SUBJECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYMPHONIES OF MOZART AND BEETHOVEN
1367-291931-0026 HAS BEEN HERE THOUGHT OF AS A MODEL AND NOTHING PLACED WITHOUT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND IT IS HOPED THAT THE CONTENTS OF THIS ANTHOLOGY WILL THUS BE FOUND TO PRESENT A CERTAIN UNITY AS EPISODES IN THE NOBLE LANGUAGE OF SHELLEY
1367-291931-0027 TO THAT GREAT POEM WHICH ALL POETS LIKE THE CO OPERATING THOUGHTS OF ONE GREAT MIND HAVE BUILT UP SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD AS HE CLOSES HIS LONG SURVEY THE EDITOR TRUSTS HE MAY ADD WITHOUT EGOTISM
1367-291931-0028 THAT HE HAS FOUND THE VAGUE GENERAL VERDICT OF POPULAR FAME MORE JUST THAN THOSE HAVE THOUGHT WHO WITH TOO SEVERE A CRITICISM WOULD CONFINE JUDGMENTS ON POETRY TO THE SELECTED FEW OF MANY GENERATIONS
1367-291931-0029 NOT MANY APPEAR TO HAVE GAINED REPUTATION WITHOUT SOME GIFT OR PERFORMANCE THAT IN DUE DEGREE DESERVED IT AND IF NO VERSES BY CERTAIN WRITERS WHO SHOW LESS STRENGTH THAN SWEETNESS
1367-291931-0030 OR MORE THOUGHT THAN MASTERY IN EXPRESSION ARE PRINTED IN THIS VOLUME IT SHOULD NOT BE IMAGINED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED WITHOUT MUCH HESITATION AND REGRET FAR LESS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTED
1367-291931-0031 THROUGHOUT THIS VAST AND PATHETIC ARRAY OF SINGERS NOW SILENT FEW HAVE BEEN HONOURED WITH THE NAME POET
1367-291931-0032 A SYMPATHY WITH BEAUTY A TENDERNESS OF FEELING OR SERIOUSNESS IN REFLECTION WHICH RENDER THEIR WORKS ALTHOUGH NEVER PERHAPS ATTAINING THAT LOFTIER AND FINER EXCELLENCE HERE REQUIRED BETTER WORTH READING THAN
