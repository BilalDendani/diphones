2517-135227-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE THE BALEFUL SACRIFICE I RESOLVED TO GO ON NO MORE SACRED HUNTS I WAS SICKENED AT THE HORRIBLE CRUELTY THE NEEDLESS SLAUGHTER THE MAD SELF SACRIFICE WHICH DISTINGUISHED THEM
2517-135227-0001 I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HORROR AT THE MERCILESS DESTRUCTION OF BRAVE COMRADES WHOSE WOUNDS SO GALLANTLY RECEIVED SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO INSPIRE PITY EVEN IN A HEART OF STONE THE GENTLENESS THE INCESSANT KINDNESS
2517-135227-0002 THE MATCHLESS GENEROSITY OF THESE PEOPLE SEEMED ALL A MOCKERY WHAT AVAILED IT ALL WHEN THE SAME HAND THAT HEAPED FAVORS UPON ME THE GUEST COULD DEAL DEATH WITHOUT COMPUNCTION UPON FRIENDS AND RELATIVES
2517-135227-0003 IT SEEMED QUITE POSSIBLE FOR THE KOHEN TO KILL HIS OWN CHILD OR CUT THE THROAT OF HIS WIFE IF THE HUMOR SEIZED HIM AND HOW LONG COULD I HOPE TO BE SPARED AMONG A PEOPLE WHO HAD THIS INSANE THIRST FOR BLOOD
2517-135227-0004 SOME MORE JOMS HAD PASSED AND THE LIGHT SEASON HAD ALMOST ENDED THE SUN HAD BEEN SINKING LOWER AND LOWER THE TIME HAD AT LAST COME WHEN ONLY A PORTION OF HIS DISK WOULD BE VISIBLE FOR A LITTLE WHILE ABOVE THE HILLS
2517-135227-0005 AND THEN HE WOULD BE SEEN NO MORE FOR SIX MONTHS OF OUR TIME THIS WAS THE DARK SEASON AND AS I HAD ALREADY LEARNED ITS ADVENT WAS ALWAYS HAILED WITH JOY AND CELEBRATED WITH SOLEMN SERVICES FOR THE DARK SEASON FREED THEM FROM THEIR LONG CONFINEMENT
2517-135227-0006 PERMITTED THEM TO GO ABROAD TO TRAVEL BY SEA AND LAND TO CARRY ON THEIR GREAT WORKS TO INDULGE IN ALL THEIR MOST IMPORTANT LABORS AND FAVORITE AMUSEMENTS THE KOHEN ASKED ME TO BE PRESENT AT THE GREAT FESTIVAL
2517-135227-0007 AND I GLADLY CONSENTED THERE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING IN THIS THAT COULD BE REPELLENT AS I WAS ANXIOUS TO WITNESS SOME OF THEIR PURELY RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES I WISHED TO GO WHEN I TOLD ALMAH SHE LOOKED SAD BUT SAID NOTHING
2517-135227-0008 I WONDERED AT THIS AND ASKED HER IF SHE WAS GOING SHE INFORMED ME THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO GO WHEREUPON I ASSURED HER THAT THIS WAS AN ADDITIONAL REASON WHY I SHOULD GO I WENT WITH ALMAH
2517-135227-0009 BUT I PREVAILED UPON HER TO SIT DOWN AND SHE DID SO THE SCENE WAS UPON THE SEMICIRCULAR TERRACE IN FRONT OF THE CAVERN AND WE WERE SEATED UPON A STONE PLATFORM BESIDE THE CHIEF PORTAL A VAST CROWD WAS GATHERED IN FRONT
2517-135227-0010 BEFORE US AROSE THE HALF PYRAMID OF WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN THE LIGHT WAS FAINT IT CAME FROM THE DISK OF THE SUN WHICH WAS PARTLY VISIBLE OVER THE ICY CREST OF THE DISTANT MOUNTAINS FAR AWAY THE SEA WAS VISIBLE
2517-135227-0011 RISING HIGH OVER THE TOPS OF THE TREES WHILE OVERHEAD THE BRIGHTER STARS WERE PLAINLY DISCERNIBLE THE KOHEN ASCENDED THE PYRAMID AND OTHERS FOLLOWED AT THE BASE THERE WAS A CROWD OF MEN
2517-135227-0012 WITH EMACIATED FORMS AND FACES AND COARSE SQUALID ATTIRE WHO LOOKED LIKE THE MOST ABJECT PAUPERS AND SEEMED THE LOWEST IN THE LAND AS THE KOHEN REACHED THE SUMMIT THERE AROSE A STRANGE SOUND
2517-135227-0013 A MOURNFUL PLAINTIVE CHANT WHICH SEEMED TO BE SUNG CHIEFLY BY THE PAUPERS AT THE BASE OF THE PYRAMID THE WORDS OF THIS CHANT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT BUT THE MELANCHOLY STRAIN AFFECTED ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF
2517-135227-0014 THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR TUNE AND NOTHING LIKE HARMONY BUT THE EFFECT OF SO MANY VOICES UNITING IN THIS STRAIN WAS VERY POWERFUL AND ALTOGETHER INDESCRIBABLE IN THE MIDST OF THIS I SAW THE CROWD PARTING ASUNDER
2517-135227-0015 SO AS TO MAKE WAY FOR SOMETHING AND THROUGH THE PASSAGE THUS FORMED I SAW A NUMBER OF YOUTHS IN LONG ROBES WHO ADVANCED TO THE PYRAMID SINGING AS THEY WENT THEN THEY ASCENDED THE STEPS TWO BY TWO STILL SINGING
2517-135227-0016 AND AT LENGTH REACHED THE SUMMIT WHERE THEY ARRANGED THEMSELVES IN ORDER THERE WERE THIRTY OF THEM AND THEY ARRANGED THEMSELVES IN THREE ROWS OF TEN EACH AND AS THEY STOOD THEY NEVER CEASED TO SING
2517-135227-0017 WHILE THE PAUPERS BELOW JOINED IN THE STRAIN AND NOW THE SUN WAS ALMOST HIDDEN AND THERE WAS ONLY THE FAINTEST LINE FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF HIS DISK PERCEPTIBLE OVER THE ICY MOUNTAIN TOPS THE LIGHT WAS A SOFTENED TWILIGHT GLOW
2517-135227-0018 IT WAS TO BE THE LAST SIGHT OF THE SUN FOR SIX MONTHS AND THIS WAS THE SPECTACLE UPON WHICH HE THREW HIS PARTING BEAM SO THE SUN PASSED AWAY AND THEN THERE CAME THE BEGINNING OF THE LONG DARK SEASON AT FIRST HOWEVER
2517-135227-0019 THERE WAS RATHER TWILIGHT THAN DARKNESS AND THIS TWILIGHT CONTINUED LONG ALL THIS ONLY SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE EFFECT OF THIS STRIKING SCENE AND AS THE LIGHT FADED AWAY I LOOKED WITH INCREASING CURIOSITY
2517-135227-0020 UPON THE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID ALMAH WAS SILENT I HALF TURNED AND SAID SOMETHING TO HER ABOUT THE BEAUTY OF THE VIEW SHE SAID NOTHING BUT LOOKED AT ME WITH SUCH AN EXPRESSION THAT I WAS FILLED WITH AMAZEMENT
2517-135227-0021 I SAW IN HER FACE SOMETHING LIKE A DREADFUL ANTICIPATION SOMETHING THAT SPOKE OF COMING EVIL THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ME AND I TURNED MY EYES BACK TO THE GROUP ON THE PYRAMID WITH VAGUE FEARS IN MY SOUL
2517-135227-0022 THOSE FEARS WERE BUT TOO WELL FOUNDED FOR NOW THE DREAD CEREMONY BEGAN THE KOHEN DREW HIS KNIFE AND PLACED HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THE STONE TABLE ONE OF THE YOUTHS CAME FORWARD STEPPED UPON IT
2517-135227-0023 AND LAY DOWN ON HIS BACK WITH HIS HEAD TOWARD THE KOHEN THE MOURNFUL CHANT STILL WENT ON THEN THE KOHEN RAISED HIS KNIFE AND PLUNGED IT INTO THE HEART OF THE YOUTH I SAT FOR A MOMENT ROOTED TO THE SPOT
2517-135227-0024 THEN A GROAN BURST FROM ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF ALMAH CAUGHT MY HANDS IN HERS WHICH WERE AS COLD AS ICE BE FIRM SHE SAID OR WE ARE BOTH LOST BE FIRM ATAM OR
2517-135227-0025 I MUST GO SAID I AND I TRIED TO RISE DON'T MOVE SHE SAID FOR YOUR LIFE WE ARE LOST IF YOU MOVE KEEP STILL RESTRAIN YOURSELF SHUT YOUR EYES I TRIED TO DO SO BUT COULD NOT
2517-135227-0026 THERE WAS A HORRIBLE FASCINATION ABOUT THE SCENE WHICH FORCED ME TO LOOK AND SEE ALL THE KOHEN TOOK THE VICTIM AND DRAWING IT FROM THE ALTAR THREW IT OVER THE PRECIPICE TO THE GROUND BENEATH THEN A LOUD SHOUT BURST FORTH FROM THE GREAT CROWD
2517-135227-0027 SIBGU SIBGIN RANENU HODU LECOSCK WHICH MEANS SACRIFICE THE VICTIMS REJOICE GIVE THANKS TO DARKNESS THEN ANOTHER OF THE YOUTHS WENT FORWARD AMID THE SINGING
2517-135227-0028 AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN TO MEET THE SAME FATE AND AGAIN THE CORPSE WAS FLUNG FROM THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID AND AGAIN THE SHOUT AROSE ALL THE OTHERS CAME FORWARD IN THE SAME MANNER OH HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
2517-135227-0029 THRICE HORRIBLE SPECTACLE I DO NOT REMEMBER HOW I ENDURED IT I SAT THERE WITH ALMAH TRYING TO RESTRAIN MYSELF AS SHE HAD ENTREATED ME MORE FOR HER SAKE THAN FOR MY OWN A PREY TO EVERY FEELING OF HORROR
2517-135227-0030 ANGUISH AND DESPAIR HOW IT ALL ENDED I DO NOT KNOW NOR DO I KNOW HOW I GOT AWAY FROM THE PLACE FOR I ONLY REMEMBER COMING BACK TO MY SENSES IN THE LIGHTED GROTTO WITH ALMAH BENDING ANXIOUSLY OVER ME
2517-135227-0031 AFTER THIS THERE REMAINED A DARK MYSTERY AND AN EVER PRESENT HORROR I FOUND MYSELF AMONG A PEOPLE WHO WERE AT ONCE THE GENTLEST OF THE HUMAN RACE AND THE MOST BLOOD THIRSTY THE KINDEST AND THE MOST CRUEL
2517-135227-0032 THIS MILD AMIABLE AND SELF SACRIFICING KOHEN HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD TRANSFORM HIMSELF TO A FIEND INCARNATE AND FOR ME AND FOR ALMAH WHAT POSSIBLE HOPE COULD THERE BE
2517-135227-0033 WHAT FATE MIGHT THEY HAVE IN RESERVE FOR US OF WHAT AVAIL WAS ALL THIS PROFOUND RESPECT THIS INCESSANT DESIRE TO PLEASE THIS ATTENTION TO OUR SLIGHTEST WISH THIS COMFORT AND LUXURY AND SPLENDOR
2517-135227-0034 THIS FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ACTION WAS IT ANYTHING BETTER THAN A MOCKERY MIGHT IT NOT BE THE SHALLOW KINDNESS OF THE PRIEST TO THE VICTIM RESERVED FOR THE SACRIFICE WAS IT AFTER ALL IN ANY DEGREE BETTER THAN THE KINDNESS
2517-135227-0035 OF THE CANNIBAL SAVAGES ON THOSE DREAR OUTER SHORES WHO RECEIVED US WITH SUCH HOSPITALITY BUT ONLY THAT THEY MIGHT DESTROY US AT LAST MIGHT THEY NOT ALL BELONG TO THE SAME RACE DWELLING AS THEY DID IN CAVERNS SHUNNING THE SUNLIGHT
2517-135227-0036 AND BLENDING KINDNESS WITH CRUELTY IT WAS AN AWFUL THOUGHT YET I HAD ONE CONSOLATION ALMAH WAS WITH ME AND SO LONG AS SHE WAS SPARED TO ME I COULD ENDURE THIS LIFE I TRIED FOR HER SAKE TO RESIST THE FEELINGS THAT WERE COMING OVER ME
2517-135227-0037 SHE FELT AS I DID AND THIS DESPAIR OF SOUL MIGHT WRECK HER YOUNG LIFE IF THERE WERE NO ALLEVIATION AND SO I SOUGHT TO ALLEVIATE HER DISTRESS AND TO BANISH HER SADNESS THE SONGS OF THESE PEOPLE HAD MUCH IMPRESSED ME
2517-135227-0038 AND ONE DAY AS I TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH ALMAH SHE BROUGHT FORTH A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT OF PECULIAR SHAPE WHICH WAS NOT UNLIKE A GUITAR THOUGH THE SHAPE WAS SQUARE AND THERE WERE A DOZEN STRINGS UPON THIS SHE PLAYED
2517-135227-0039 AN IDEA NOW OCCURRED TO ME TO HAVE AN INSTRUMENT MADE ACCORDING TO MY OWN PLANS WHICH SHOULD BE NOTHING LESS THAN A VIOLIN ALMAH WAS DELIGHTED AT THE PROPOSAL AND AT ONCE FOUND A VERY CLEVER WORKMAN WHO UNDER MY DIRECTION
2517-135227-0040 SUCCEEDED IN PRODUCING ONE WHICH SERVED MY PURPOSE WELL I WAS A GOOD VIOLINIST AND IN THIS I WAS ABLE TO FIND SOLACE FOR MYSELF AND FOR ALMAH FOR MANY A LONG HOUR THE FIRST TIME THAT I PLAYED WAS MEMORABLE
2517-135227-0041 AS THE TONES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR THEY CAUGHT THE EARS OF THOSE OUTSIDE AND SOON GREAT NUMBERS CAME INTO THE APARTMENT LISTENING IN AMAZEMENT AND IN RAPT ATTENTION EVEN THE PAINFUL LIGHT WAS DISREGARDED IN THE PLEASURE OF THIS MOST NOVEL SENSATION
2517-135227-0042 AND I PERCEIVED THAT IF THE SENSE OF SIGHT WAS DEFICIENT AMONG THEM THAT OF HEARING WAS SUFFICIENTLY ACUTE I PLAYED MANY TIMES AND SOMETIMES SANG FROM AMONG THE SONGS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS BUT THOSE WHICH THESE PEOPLE LIKED BEST
2517-135227-0043 WERE THE IRISH AND SCOTTISH MELODIES THOSE MATCHLESS STRAINS CREATED BY THE GENIUS OF THE CELTIC RACE AND HANDED DOWN FROM IMMEMORIAL AGES THROUGH LONG GENERATIONS IN THESE THERE WAS NOTHING ARTIFICIAL NOTHING TRANSIENT
2517-135227-0044 THEY WERE THE UTTERANCE OF THE HUMAN HEART AND IN THEM THERE WAS THAT TOUCH OF NATURE WHICH MAKES ALL MEN KIN THESE WERE THE IMMORTAL PASSIONS WHICH SHALL NEVER CEASE TO AFFECT THE SOUL OF MAN AND WHICH HAD POWER EVEN HERE
2517-135227-0045 THE STRAINS OF LOVE OF SADNESS AND OF PATHOS WERE SWEET AND ENTICING TO THIS GENTLE RACE FOR IN THEIR MILD MANNERS AND THEIR OUTBURST OF CRUELTY THEY SEEMED TO BE NOT UNLIKE THE VERY RACE WHICH HAD CREATED THIS MUSIC
2517-135227-0046 SINCE THE CELT IS AT ONCE GENTLE AND BLOOD THIRSTY I PLAYED TARA BONNIE DOON THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER THE LAND OF THE LEAL AULD LANG SYNE
2517-135227-0047 THEY STOOD ENTRANCED LISTENING WITH ALL THEIR SOULS THEY SEEMED TO HUNGER AND THIRST AFTER THIS MUSIC AND THE STRAINS OF THE INSPIRED CELTIC RACE SEEMED TO COME TO THEM LIKE THE REVELATION OF THE GLORY OF HEAVEN THEN I PLAYED MORE LIVELY AIRS
2517-135227-0048 SOME I PLAYED A SECOND TIME SINGING THE WORDS THEY SEEMED EAGER TO HAVE THE SAME ONE PLAYED OFTEN AT LAST A GRISLY THOUGHT CAME TO ME IT WAS THAT THEY WOULD LEARN THESE SWEET STRAINS AND PUT THEIR OWN WORDS TO THEM
2517-135227-0049 SO AS TO USE THEM AT THE AWFUL SACRIFICES AFTER THAT I WOULD PLAY NO MORE IT IS A LAND OF TENDER LOVE AND REMORSELESS CRUELTY MUSIC IS ALL POWERFUL TO AWAKEN THE ONE BUT POWERLESS TO ABATE THE OTHER
