288-121741-0000 CHAPTER FOUR KIRSTY MY FATHER HAD A HOUSEKEEPER A TRUSTY WOMAN HE CONSIDERED HER WE THOUGHT HER VERY OLD I SUPPOSE SHE WAS ABOUT FORTY SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT FOR SHE WAS GRIM FACED AND CENSORIOUS
288-121741-0001 WITH A VERY STRAIGHT BACK AND A VERY LONG UPPER LIP INDEED THE DISTANCE FROM HER NOSE TO HER MOUTH WAS GREATER THAN THE LENGTH OF HER NOSE WHEN I THINK OF HER FIRST IT IS ALWAYS AS MAKING SOME COMPLAINT TO MY FATHER AGAINST US
288-121741-0002 PERHAPS SHE MEANT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH OR RATHER PERHAPS TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT SHE ALWAYS DID SPEAK THE TRUTH BUT CERTAINLY SHE WOULD EXAGGERATE THINGS AND GIVE THEM QUITE ANOTHER LOOK THE BONES OF HER STORY MIGHT BE TRUE
288-121741-0003 BUT SHE WOULD PUT A SKIN OVER IT AFTER HER OWN FASHION
288-121741-0004 THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE OLDER WE GREW THE MORE OUR MINDS WERE ALIENATED FROM HER AND THE MORE WE CAME TO REGARD HER AS OUR ENEMY IF SHE REALLY MEANT TO BE OUR FRIEND AFTER THE BEST FASHION SHE KNEW IT WAS AT LEAST AN UNCOMELY KIND OF FRIENDSHIP
288-121741-0005 THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN CONSTANT OPPOSITION FAULT FINDING AND COMPLAINT THE REAL MISTAKE WAS THAT WE WERE BOYS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER ALTOGETHER ANTAGONISTIC TO THE BOY NATURE
288-121741-0006 YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT TO BE A BOY WAS IN HER EYES TO BE SOMETHING WRONG TO BEGIN WITH
288-121741-0007 BY THEIR VERY NATURE BE ABOUT SOMETHING AMISS I HAVE OCCASIONALLY WONDERED HOW SHE WOULD HAVE BEHAVED TO A GIRL ON REFLECTION I THINK A LITTLE BETTER BUT THE GIRL WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE OFF BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED FROM HER AS WE DID
288-121741-0008 MY FATHER WOULD HEAR HER COMPLAINTS TO THE END WITHOUT PUTTING IN A WORD EXCEPT IT WERE TO ASK HER A QUESTION
288-121741-0009 WOULD TURN AGAIN TO HIS BOOK OR HIS SERMON SAYING VERY WELL MISSUS MITCHELL
288-121741-0010 MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE HALF SHE TOLD HIM AT ALL EVENTS
288-121741-0011 HE WOULD ASK OUR VERSION OF THE AFFAIR AND LISTEN TO THAT AS HE HAD LISTENED TO HERS THEN HE WOULD SET FORTH TO US WHERE WE HAD BEEN WRONG IF WE WERE WRONG AND SEND US AWAY WITH AN INJUNCTION NOT TO PROVOKE MISSUS MITCHELL WHO COULDN'T HELP BEING SHORT IN HER TEMPER POOR THING
288-121741-0012 SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE GOT IT INTO OUR HEADS THAT THE SHORTNESS OF HER TEMPER WAS MYSTERIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORTNESS OF HER NOSE SHE WAS SAVING EVEN TO STINGINESS SHE WOULD DO HER BEST TO PROVIDE WHAT MY FATHER LIKED
288-121741-0013 BUT FOR US SHE THOUGHT ALMOST ANYTHING GOOD ENOUGH SHE WOULD FOR INSTANCE GIVE US THE THINNEST OF MILK WE SAID SHE SKIMMED IT THREE TIMES BEFORE SHE THOUGHT IT BLUE ENOUGH FOR US MY TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS DID NOT MIND IT SO MUCH AS I DID
288-121741-0014 FOR I WAS ALWAYS RATHER DELICATE AND IF I TOOK A DISLIKE TO ANYTHING WOULD RATHER GO WITHOUT THAN EAT OR DRINK OF IT BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU ENOUGH ABOUT HER TO MAKE IT PLAIN THAT SHE COULD BE NO FAVOURITE WITH US
288-121741-0015 AND ENOUGH LIKEWISE TO SERVE AS A BACKGROUND TO MY DESCRIPTION OF KIRSTY KIRSTY WAS A HIGHLAND WOMAN WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH THE FARM SERVANTS LIVED SHE WAS A CHEERFUL GRACIOUS KIND WOMAN A WOMAN OF GOD'S MAKING ONE WOULD SAY
288-121741-0016 WE CANNOT DENY THAT HE MADE MISSUS MITCHELL TOO IT IS VERY PUZZLING I CONFESS I REMEMBER ONCE THAT MY YOUNGEST BROTHER DAVIE A VERY LITTLE FELLOW THEN FOR HE COULD NOT SPEAK PLAINLY
288-121741-0017 CAME RUNNING IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KIRSTY CRYING FEE FEE BY WHICH HE MEANT TO INDICATE THAT A FLEA WAS RENDERING HIS LIFE MISERABLE
288-121741-0018 SAID NOT IN A QUESTIONING BUT IN A CONCLUDING TONE GOD DIDN'T MAKE THE FEES KIRSTY OH YES DAVIE GOD MADE EVERYTHING GOD DID MAKE THE FLEAS SAID KIRSTY DAVIE WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE
288-121741-0019 THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SPAKE LIKE A DISCONTENTED PROPHET OF OLD WHY DOESN'T HE GIVE THEM SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT THEN
288-121741-0020 WITH A WISDOM I HAVE SINCE LEARNED TO COMPREHEND THOUGH I REMEMBER IT SHOCKED ME A LITTLE AT THE TIME ALL THIS SET ME THINKING BEFORE THE DRESSING OF LITTLE DAVIE WAS OVER I HAD MY QUESTION TO PUT TO KIRSTY IT WAS IN FACT THE SAME QUESTION
288-121741-0021 OH SHE'S NOT A BAD SORT SAID KIRSTY THOUGH I MUST SAY IF I WAS HER I WOULD TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE AGREEABLE TO RETURN TO KIRSTY SHE WAS OUR CONSTANT RESORT
288-121741-0022 WHICH SHE CLAIMED FOR ALL HIGHLAND FOLK A LIGHT STEP A SWEET VOICE AND A MOST BOUNTEOUS HAND BUT THERE I COME INTO THE MORAL NATURE OF HER
288-121741-0023 FOR HER FACE I THINK THAT WAS RATHER QUEER
288-121741-0024 WHETHER SHE WAS NICE LOOKING OR NOT
288-121741-0025 IT WAS SHE WHO GAVE US SOMETHING TO EAT AS OFTEN AND AS MUCH AS WE WANTED
288-121741-0026 HAVING MANY BLEAK MOORLAND HILLS THAT LAY ABOUT LIKE SLOW STIFFENED WAVES OF NO GREAT HEIGHT BUT OF MUCH DESOLATION AND AS FAR AS THE IMAGINATION WAS CONCERNED IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE MINDS OF FORMER GENERATIONS HAD BEEN AS BLEAK AS THE COUNTRY
288-121741-0027 BUT KIRSTY HAD COME FROM A REGION WHERE THE HILLS WERE HILLS INDEED HILLS WITH MIGHTY SKELETONS OF STONE INSIDE THEM
288-121741-0028 WHICH WERE EVER TRYING TO GET UP A COUNTRY WHERE EVERY CLIFF AND ROCK AND WELL HAD ITS STORY
