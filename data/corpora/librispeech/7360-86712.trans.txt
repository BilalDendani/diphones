7360-86712-0000 THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE COMMUNICATED WITH THE PRISON A SOMBRE EDIFICE
7360-86712-0001 THE COMMISSARY TOOK UP AN IRON MALLET AND KNOCKED THRICE
7360-86712-0002 AND THE DOOR CLOSED WITH A LOUD SOUND BEHIND HIM THE AIR HE INHALED WAS NO LONGER PURE BUT THICK AND MEPHITIC HE WAS IN PRISON HE WAS CONDUCTED TO A TOLERABLY NEAT CHAMBER BUT GRATED AND BARRED
7360-86712-0003 AND ITS APPEARANCE THEREFORE DID NOT GREATLY ALARM HIM
7360-86712-0004 WHO SEEMED TO INTEREST HIMSELF SO MUCH RESOUNDED STILL IN HIS EARS LIKE A PROMISE OF FREEDOM IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK WHEN DANTES WAS PLACED IN THIS CHAMBER IT WAS AS WE HAVE SAID THE FIRST OF MARCH AND THE PRISONER WAS SOON BURIED IN DARKNESS
7360-86712-0005 THE OBSCURITY AUGMENTED THE ACUTENESS OF HIS HEARING AT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND HE ROSE AND HASTENED TO THE DOOR CONVINCED THEY WERE ABOUT TO LIBERATE HIM BUT THE SOUND DIED AWAY AND DANTES SANK AGAIN INTO HIS SEAT AT LAST ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK
7360-86712-0006 AND JUST AS DANTES BEGAN TO DESPAIR STEPS WERE HEARD IN THE CORRIDOR A KEY TURNED IN THE LOCK
7360-86712-0007 THE MASSY OAKEN DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A FLOOD OF LIGHT FROM TWO TORCHES PERVADED THE APARTMENT BY THE TORCHLIGHT DANTES SAW THE GLITTERING SABRES AND CARBINES OF FOUR GENDARMES HE HAD ADVANCED AT FIRST
7360-86712-0008 BY THE ORDERS OF THE DEPUTY PROCUREUR I BELIEVE SO
7360-86712-0009 HE ADVANCED CALMLY AND PLACED HIMSELF IN THE CENTRE OF THE ESCORT A CARRIAGE WAITED AT THE DOOR THE COACHMAN WAS ON THE BOX AND A POLICE OFFICER SAT BESIDE HIM
7360-86712-0010 IT IS FOR YOU REPLIED A GENDARME
7360-86712-0011 BUT FEELING HIMSELF URGED FORWARD AND HAVING NEITHER THE POWER NOR THE INTENTION TO RESIST HE MOUNTED THE STEPS AND WAS IN AN INSTANT SEATED INSIDE BETWEEN TWO GENDARMES THE TWO OTHERS TOOK THEIR PLACES OPPOSITE AND THE CARRIAGE ROLLED HEAVILY OVER THE STONES
7360-86712-0012 THE PRISONER GLANCED AT THE WINDOWS THEY WERE GRATED HE HAD CHANGED HIS PRISON FOR ANOTHER THAT WAS CONVEYING HIM HE KNEW NOT WHITHER THROUGH THE GRATING HOWEVER DANTES SAW
7360-86712-0013 AND BY THE RUE SAINT LAURENT AND THE RUE TARAMIS TO THE PORT
7360-86712-0014 THE CARRIAGE STOPPED THE OFFICER DESCENDED APPROACHED THE GUARDHOUSE A DOZEN SOLDIERS CAME OUT AND FORMED THEMSELVES IN ORDER
7360-86712-0015 CAN ALL THIS FORCE BE SUMMONED ON MY ACCOUNT THOUGHT HE THE OFFICER OPENED THE DOOR WHICH WAS LOCKED AND WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD
7360-86712-0016 FROM THE CARRIAGE TO THE PORT THE TWO GENDARMES WHO WERE OPPOSITE TO HIM DESCENDED FIRST THEN HE WAS ORDERED TO ALIGHT AND THE GENDARMES ON EACH SIDE OF HIM FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS A BOAT WHICH A CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICER
7360-86712-0017 THE SOLDIERS LOOKED AT DANTES WITH AN AIR OF STUPID CURIOSITY IN AN INSTANT HE WAS PLACED IN THE STERN SHEETS OF THE BOAT BETWEEN THE GENDARMES WHILE THE OFFICER STATIONED HIMSELF AT THE BOW
7360-86712-0018 AT A SHOUT FROM THE BOAT THE CHAIN THAT CLOSES THE MOUTH OF THE PORT WAS LOWERED AND IN A SECOND THEY WERE AS DANTES KNEW IN THE FRIOUL AND OUTSIDE THE INNER HARBOR THE PRISONER'S FIRST FEELING WAS OF JOY AT AGAIN BREATHING THE PURE AIR FOR AIR IS FREEDOM
7360-86712-0019 WHERE HE HAD THAT MORNING BEEN SO HAPPY AND NOW THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS CAME THE LAUGHTER AND REVELRY OF A BALL
7360-86712-0020 THE BOAT CONTINUED HER VOYAGE
7360-86712-0021 WHITHER ARE YOU TAKING ME ASKED HE YOU WILL SOON KNOW BUT STILL WE ARE FORBIDDEN TO GIVE YOU ANY EXPLANATION DANTES TRAINED IN DISCIPLINE KNEW THAT NOTHING WOULD BE MORE ABSURD THAN TO QUESTION SUBORDINATES WHO WERE FORBIDDEN TO REPLY
7360-86712-0022 AND SO HE REMAINED SILENT THE MOST VAGUE AND WILD THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND THE BOAT THEY WERE IN COULD NOT MAKE A LONG VOYAGE THERE WAS NO VESSEL AT ANCHOR OUTSIDE THE HARBOR HE THOUGHT PERHAPS THEY WERE GOING TO LEAVE HIM ON SOME DISTANT POINT
7360-86712-0023 HE WAS NOT BOUND NOR HAD THEY MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO HANDCUFF HIM THIS SEEMED A GOOD AUGURY BESIDES HAD NOT THE DEPUTY WHO HAD BEEN SO KIND TO HIM TOLD HIM THAT PROVIDED HE DID NOT PRONOUNCE THE DREADED NAME OF NOIRTIER HE HAD NOTHING TO APPREHEND
7360-86712-0024 THE ONLY PROOF AGAINST HIM HE WAITED SILENTLY STRIVING TO PIERCE THROUGH THE DARKNESS THEY HAD LEFT THE ILE RATONNEAU WHERE THE LIGHTHOUSE STOOD
7360-86712-0025 IT SEEMED TO THE PRISONER THAT HE COULD DISTINGUISH A FEMININE FORM ON THE BEACH FOR IT WAS THERE MERCEDES DWELT
7360-86712-0026 MERCEDES WAS THE ONLY ONE AWAKE IN THE WHOLE SETTLEMENT A LOUD CRY COULD BE HEARD BY HER BUT PRIDE RESTRAINED HIM AND HE DID NOT UTTER IT WHAT WOULD HIS GUARDS THINK IF THEY HEARD HIM SHOUT LIKE A MADMAN HE REMAINED SILENT HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE LIGHT
7360-86712-0027 THE BOAT WENT ON BUT THE PRISONER THOUGHT ONLY OF MERCEDES AN INTERVENING ELEVATION OF LAND HID THE LIGHT DANTES TURNED AND PERCEIVED THAT THEY HAD GOT OUT TO SEA WHILE HE HAD BEEN ABSORBED IN THOUGHT THEY HAD SHIPPED THEIR OARS AND HOISTED SAIL THE BOAT WAS NOW MOVING WITH THE WIND
7360-86712-0028 IN SPITE OF HIS REPUGNANCE TO ADDRESS THE GUARDS DANTES TURNED TO THE NEAREST GENDARME AND TAKING HIS HAND COMRADE SAID HE
7360-86712-0029 TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE CONDUCTING ME AND I PROMISE YOU ON MY HONOR I WILL SUBMIT TO MY FATE THE GENDARME LOOKED IRRESOLUTELY AT HIS COMPANION WHO RETURNED FOR ANSWER A SIGN THAT SAID I SEE NO GREAT HARM IN TELLING HIM NOW AND THE GENDARME REPLIED

7360-86712-0036 YOU THINK THEN SAID HE THAT I AM TAKEN TO THE CHATEAU D'IF TO BE IMPRISONED THERE IT IS PROBABLE BUT THERE IS NO OCCASION TO SQUEEZE SO HARD

7360-86712-0041 FOR A MOMENT THE IDEA OF STRUGGLING CROSSED HIS MIND AND OF SO ENDING THE UNEXPECTED EVIL THAT HAD OVERTAKEN HIM
7360-86712-0042 AND BESIDES DEATH IN A BOAT FROM THE HAND OF A GENDARME SEEMED TOO TERRIBLE HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS BUT GNASHING HIS TEETH AND WRINGING HIS HANDS WITH FURY AT THIS MOMENT THE BOAT CAME TO A LANDING WITH A VIOLENT SHOCK
7360-86712-0043 HIS GUARDS TAKING HIM BY THE ARMS AND COAT COLLAR FORCED HIM TO RISE AND DRAGGED HIM TOWARDS THE STEPS THAT LEAD TO THE GATE OF THE FORTRESS WHILE THE POLICE OFFICER CARRYING A MUSKET WITH FIXED BAYONET FOLLOWED BEHIND DANTES MADE NO RESISTANCE HE WAS LIKE A MAN IN A DREAM
7360-86712-0044 HE SAW SOLDIERS DRAWN UP ON THE EMBANKMENT HE KNEW VAGUELY THAT HE WAS ASCENDING A FLIGHT OF STEPS HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE PASSED THROUGH A DOOR AND THAT THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM BUT ALL THIS INDISTINCTLY AS THROUGH A MIST HE DID NOT EVEN SEE THE OCEAN THAT TERRIBLE BARRIER AGAINST FREEDOM
7360-86712-0045 WHICH THE PRISONERS LOOK UPON WITH UTTER DESPAIR THEY HALTED FOR A MINUTE DURING WHICH HE STROVE TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS HE LOOKED AROUND HE WAS IN A COURT SURROUNDED BY HIGH WALLS

7360-86712-0051 LEAVING STAMPED UPON THE PRISONER'S MIND THE DIM REFLECTION OF THE DRIPPING WALLS OF HIS DUNGEON DANTES WAS ALONE IN DARKNESS AND IN SILENCE COLD AS THE SHADOWS THAT HE FELT BREATHE ON HIS BURNING FOREHEAD
7360-86712-0052 HE FOUND THE PRISONER IN THE SAME POSITION AS IF FIXED THERE HIS EYES SWOLLEN WITH WEEPING HE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT STANDING AND WITHOUT SLEEP THE JAILER ADVANCED DANTES APPEARED NOT TO PERCEIVE HIM HE TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER EDMOND STARTED
