6974-258420-0000 THE ILIAD OF HOMER RENDERED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE BY EDWARD EARL OF DERBY PREFACE IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO I WAS INDUCED
6974-258420-0001 IN WHICH WAS INCLUDED THE FIRST BOOK
6974-258420-0002 SOURCE OF INTEREST AND IT IS NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF REGRET AT THE COMPLETION OF MY TASK AND A SINCERE DIFFIDENCE AS TO ITS SUCCESS THAT I VENTURE TO SUBMIT THE RESULT OF MY LABOUR TO THE ORDEAL
6974-258420-0003 OF PUBLIC CRITICISM VARIOUS CAUSES IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY DEMERITS OF THE WORK ITSELF FORBID ME TO ANTICIPATE FOR THIS TRANSLATION ANY EXTENSIVE POPULARITY
6974-258420-0004 FIRST I FEAR THAT THE TASTE FOR AND APPRECIATION OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE ARE GREATLY ON THE DECLINE NEXT THOSE WHO HAVE KEPT UP THEIR CLASSICAL STUDIES
6974-258420-0005 AND ARE ABLE TO READ AND ENJOY THE ORIGINAL WILL HARDLY TAKE AN INTEREST IN A MERE TRANSLATION WHILE THE ENGLISH READER UNACQUAINTED WITH GREEK
6974-258420-0006 OF POPE'S TRANSLATION WITH WHICH AS A HAPPY ADAPTATION OF THE HOMERIC STORY TO THE SPIRIT OF ENGLISH POETRY I HAVE NOT THE PRESUMPTION TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION BUT ADMIRABLE AS IT IS
6974-258420-0007 POPE'S ILIAD CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO BE HOMER'S ILIAD
6974-258420-0008 HAVE RECALLED TO THEIR MINDS A FAINT ECHO OF THE STRAINS WHICH DELIGHTED THEIR EARLIER DAYS AND MAY RECOGNIZE SOME SLIGHT TRACE OF THE ORIGINAL PERFUME NUMEROUS AS HAVE BEEN THE TRANSLATORS OF THE ILIAD
6974-258420-0009 OR OF PARTS OF IT THE METRES WHICH HAVE BEEN SELECTED HAVE BEEN ALMOST AS VARIOUS THE ORDINARY COUPLET IN RHYME THE SPENSERIAN STANZA THE TROCHAIC OR BALLAD METRE
6974-258420-0010 ALL HAVE HAD THEIR PARTISANS EVEN TO THAT
6974-258420-0011 OF THE SO CALLED ENGLISH HEXAMETER A METRE WHOLLY REPUGNANT TO THE GENIUS OF OUR LANGUAGE WHICH CAN ONLY BE PRESSED INTO THE SERVICE BY A VIOLATION OF EVERY RULE OF PROSODY
6974-258420-0012 AND OF WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING MY RESPECT FOR THE EMINENT MEN WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO NATURALIZE IT I COULD NEVER READ TEN LINES WITHOUT BEING IRRESISTIBLY REMINDED OF CANNING'S
6974-258420-0013 DACTYLICS CALL'ST THOU THEM GOD HELP THEE SILLY ONE
6974-258420-0014 BUT IN THE PROGRESS OF THIS WORK I HAVE BEEN MORE AND MORE CONFIRMED IN THE OPINION WHICH I EXPRESSED AT ITS COMMENCEMENT THAT WHATEVER MAY BE THE EXTENT OF MY OWN INDIVIDUAL FAILURE
6974-258420-0015 IF JUSTICE IS EVER TO BE DONE TO THE EASY FLOW AND MAJESTIC SIMPLICITY OF THE GRAND OLD POET IT CAN ONLY BE IN THE HEROIC BLANK VERSE
6974-258420-0016 AND THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH A TRANSLATION LINE FOR LINE AND COUPLET FOR COUPLET NATURALLY SUGGESTS ITSELF AND IN WHICH IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO AVOID AN INVOLUNTARY RHYME
6974-258420-0017 BUT THE BLANK VERSE APPEARS TO ME THE ONLY METRE CAPABLE OF ADAPTING ITSELF TO ALL THE GRADATIONS IF I MAY USE THE TERM OF THE HOMERIC STYLE
6974-258420-0018 FROM THE FINISHED POETRY OF THE NUMEROUS SIMILES IN WHICH EVERY TOUCH IS NATURE AND NOTHING IS OVERCOLOURED OR EXAGGERATED DOWN TO THE SIMPLE ALMOST HOMELY STYLE OF SOME PORTIONS OF THE NARRATIVE
6974-258420-0019 LEAST OF ALL CAN ANY OTHER METRE DO FULL JUSTICE TO THE SPIRIT AND FREEDOM OF THE VARIOUS SPEECHES IN WHICH THE OLD WARRIORS GIVE UTTERANCE WITHOUT DISGUISE OR RESTRAINT TO ALL THEIR STRONG AND GENUINE EMOTIONS
6974-258420-0020 TO SUBJECT THESE TO THE TRAMMELS OF COUPLET AND RHYME WOULD BE AS DESTRUCTIVE OF THEIR CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS AS THE APPLICATION OF A SIMILAR PROCESS TO THE PARADISE LOST OF MILTON
6974-258420-0021 OR THE TRAGEDIES OF SHAKESPEARE THE EFFECT INDEED MAY BE SEEN BY COMPARING WITH SOME OF THE NOBLEST SPEECHES OF THE LATTER THE FEW COUPLETS WHICH HE SEEMS TO HAVE CONSIDERED HIMSELF BOUND BY
6974-258420-0022 CUSTOM TO TACK ON TO THEIR CLOSE AT THE END OF A SCENE OR AN ACT I HAVE ADOPTED NOT WITHOUT HESITATION THE LATIN RATHER THAN THE GREEK NOMENCLATURE FOR THE HEATHEN DEITIES
6974-258420-0023 I HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO DO SO FROM THE MANIFEST INCONGRUITY OF CONFOUNDING THE TWO AND FROM THE FACT THAT THOUGH ENGLISH READERS MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE NAMES OF ZEUS OR APHRODITE OR EVEN POSEIDON
6974-258420-0024 WOULD HARDLY CONVEY TO THEM A DEFINITE SIGNIFICATION IT HAS BEEN MY AIM THROUGHOUT TO PRODUCE A TRANSLATION AND NOT A PARAPHRASE
6974-258420-0025 WITH REGARD TO EACH WORD THE RIGID REQUIREMENTS OF ACCURATE SCHOLARSHIP BUT SUCH AS WOULD FAIRLY AND HONESTLY GIVE THE SENSE AND SPIRIT OF EVERY PASSAGE AND OF EVERY LINE OMITTING NOTHING
6974-258420-0026 AND EXPANDING NOTHING AND ADHERING AS CLOSELY AS OUR LANGUAGE WILL ALLOW EVER TO EVERY EPITHET WHICH IS CAPABLE OF BEING TRANSLATED AND WHICH HAS IN THE PARTICULAR PASSAGE
6974-258420-0027 ANYTHING OF A SPECIAL AND DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER OF THE MANY DEFICIENCIES IN MY EXECUTION OF THIS INTENTION I AM BUT TOO CONSCIOUS WHETHER I HAVE BEEN IN ANY DEGREE SUCCESSFUL
6974-258420-0028 MUST BE LEFT TO THE IMPARTIAL DECISION OF SUCH OF THE PUBLIC AS MAY HONOUR THIS WORK WITH THEIR PERUSAL D KNOWSLEY OCTOBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR
6974-258420-0029 NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION THE FAVOURABLE RECEPTION WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE FIRST EDITIONS OF THIS WORK FAR EXCEEDING MY MOST SANGUINE HOPES
6974-258420-0030 AFFORDS A GRATIFYING PROOF HOW FAR IN MY PREFACE I HAD OVERRATED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE TASTE FOR AND APPRECIATION OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE HAD DECLINED IT WILL NOT I HOPE
6974-258420-0031 BE THOUGHT EXTRAORDINARY THAT SOME ERRORS AND INACCURACIES SHOULD HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO A TRANSLATION EXECUTED I MUST ADMIT SOMEWHAT HASTILY
6974-258420-0032 THAN I SHOULD HAVE BESTOWED UPON IT HAD I VENTURED TO ANTICIPATE FOR IT SO EXTENSIVE A CIRCULATION MY THANKS THEREFORE ARE DUE TO THOSE CRITICS WHO EITHER PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY
6974-258420-0033 HAVE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO PASSAGES IN WHICH THE SENSE OF THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN EITHER INCORRECTLY OR IMPERFECTLY RENDERED ALL OF THESE I HAVE EXAMINED AND HAVE AVAILED MYSELF
6974-258420-0034 OF SEVERAL OF THE SUGGESTIONS OFFERED FOR THEIR CORRECTION AND A CAREFUL REVISION OF THE WHOLE WORK AND RENEWED COMPARISON WITH THE ORIGINAL HAVE ENABLED ME TO DISCOVER OTHER DEFECTS
6974-258420-0035 THE REMOVAL OF WHICH WILL I HOPE RENDER THE PRESENT EDITION ESPECIALLY IN THE EYES OF CLASSICAL SCHOLARS SOMEWHAT MORE WORTHY OF THE FAVOUR WHICH HAS BEEN ACCORDED TO ITS PREDECESSORS D
