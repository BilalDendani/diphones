5261-19371-0000 WRITE DOWN THE SERIES ZERO THREE SIX TWELVE TWENTY FOUR
5261-19371-0001 PALLAS IN MARCH EIGHTEEN O TWO BY OLBERS JUNO IN EIGHTEEN O FOUR BY HARDING AND VESTA IN EIGHTEEN O SEVEN BY OLBERS NO MORE ASTEROIDS WERE DISCOVERED TILL EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE
5261-19371-0002 BUT THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL HUNDREDS KNOWN THEIR DIAMETERS RANGE FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO TWENTY MILES NEPTUNE WAS DISCOVERED FROM THE PERTURBATIONS OF URANUS BY SHEER CALCULATION
5261-19371-0003 IT WAS FIRST KNOWINGLY SEEN BY GALLE OF BERLIN ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX
5261-19371-0004 THE DISCOVERY OF THE ASTEROIDS UP TO THE TIME OF HERSCHEL ASTRONOMICAL INTEREST CENTRED ON THE SOLAR SYSTEM SINCE THAT TIME IT HAS BEEN DIVIDED AND A GREAT PART OF OUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE MORE DISTANT CELESTIAL BODIES
5261-19371-0005 THE SOLAR SYSTEM HAS BY NO MEANS LOST ITS INTEREST IT HAS INDEED GAINED IN INTEREST CONTINUALLY AS WE GAIN IN KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING IT BUT IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF SCIENCE IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR US TO OSCILLATE TO AND FRO
5261-19371-0006 SOMETIMES ATTENDING TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM THE PLANETS AND THEIR SATELLITES SOMETIMES EXTENDING OUR VISION TO THE ENORMOUSLY MORE DISTANT STELLAR SPACES
5261-19371-0007 AN EMPIRICAL RELATION IS HOWEVER KNOWN
5261-19371-0008 BODE'S LAW ASSERTS THAT THE DISTANCE OF EACH PLANET IS APPROXIMATELY DOUBLE THE DISTANCE OF THE INNER ADJACENT PLANET FROM THE SUN BUT THAT THE RATE OF INCREASE IS DISTINCTLY SLOWER THAN THIS FOR THE INNER ONES
5261-19371-0009 CONSEQUENTLY A BETTER APPROXIMATION WILL BE OBTAINED BY ADDING A CONSTANT TO EACH TERM OF AN APPROPRIATE GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION THUS FORM A DOUBLING SERIES LIKE THIS
5261-19371-0010 SIX TWELVE
5261-19371-0011 THEN ADD FOUR TO EACH AND YOU GET A SERIES WHICH EXPRESSES VERY FAIRLY THE RELATIVE DISTANCES OF THE SUCCESSIVE PLANETS FROM THE SUN EXCEPT THAT THE NUMBER FOR MERCURY IS RATHER ERRONEOUS
5261-19371-0012 A QUIET ASTRONOMER IN SICILY PIAZZI WAS ENGAGED IN MAKING A CATALOGUE OF THE STARS HIS ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO A CERTAIN REGION IN TAURUS BY AN ERROR IN A PREVIOUS CATALOGUE WHICH CONTAINED A STAR REALLY NON EXISTENT
5261-19371-0013 IN THE COURSE OF HIS SCRUTINY ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN O ONE HE NOTICED A SMALL STAR WHICH NEXT EVENING APPEARED TO HAVE SHIFTED
5261-19371-0014 HE WATCHED IT ANXIOUSLY FOR SUCCESSIVE EVENINGS AND BY THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JANUARY HE WAS QUITE SURE HE HAD GOT HOLD OF SOME MOVING BODY NOT A STAR PROBABLY HE THOUGHT A COMET IT WAS VERY SMALL ONLY OF THE EIGHTH MAGNITUDE
5261-19371-0015 AND HE WROTE TO TWO ASTRONOMERS ONE OF THEM BODE HIMSELF SAYING WHAT HE HAD OBSERVED HE CONTINUED TO OBSERVE TILL THE ELEVENTH OF FEBRUARY WHEN HE WAS ATTACKED BY ILLNESS AND COMPELLED TO CEASE HIS LETTERS DID NOT REACH THEIR DESTINATION TILL THE END OF MARCH
5261-19371-0016 BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS UNABLE TO VERIFY THE GUESS FOR THE OBJECT WHATEVER IT WAS HAD NOW GOT TOO NEAR THE SUN TO BE SEEN IT WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO BE OUT AGAIN BEFORE SEPTEMBER AND BY THAT TIME IT WOULD BE HOPELESSLY LOST AGAIN
5261-19371-0017 AND HAVE JUST AS MUCH TO BE REDISCOVERED AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN MATHEMATICAL ASTRONOMERS TRIED TO CALCULATE A POSSIBLE ORBIT FOR THE BODY FROM THE OBSERVATIONS OF PIAZZI BUT THE OBSERVED PLACES WERE SO DESPERATELY FEW AND CLOSE TOGETHER
5261-19371-0018 IT WAS LIKE HAVING TO DETERMINE A CURVE FROM THREE POINTS CLOSE TOGETHER
5261-19371-0019 ALL THE CALCULATIONS GAVE DIFFERENT RESULTS AND NONE WERE OF THE SLIGHTEST USE THE DIFFICULTY AS IT TURNED OUT WAS MOST FORTUNATE IT RESULTED IN THE DISCOVERY OF ONE OF THE GREATEST MATHEMATICIANS PERHAPS THE GREATEST THAT GERMANY HAS EVER PRODUCED
5261-19371-0020 GAUSS HE WAS THEN A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY FIVE EKING OUT A LIVING BY TUITION HE HAD INVENTED BUT NOT PUBLISHED SEVERAL POWERFUL MATHEMATICAL METHODS ONE OF THEM NOW KNOWN AS THE METHOD OF LEAST SQUARES AND HE APPLIED THEM TO PIAZZI'S OBSERVATIONS
5261-19371-0021 HE WAS THUS ABLE TO CALCULATE AN ORBIT AND TO PREDICT A PLACE WHERE BY THE END OF THE YEAR THE PLANET SHOULD BE VISIBLE ON THE THIRTY FIRST OF DECEMBER OF THAT SAME YEAR VERY NEAR THE PLACE PREDICTED BY GAUSS VON ZACH
5261-19371-0022 REDISCOVERED IT AND OLBERS DISCOVERED IT ALSO THE NEXT EVENING PIAZZI CALLED IT CERES AFTER THE TUTELARY GODDESS OF SICILY ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN AS DETERMINED BY GAUSS WAS TWO POINT SEVEN SIX SEVEN TIMES THE EARTH'S DISTANCE
5261-19371-0023 WHICH WAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE AMOUNT VERY SOON A MORE SURPRISING DISCOVERY FOLLOWED OLBERS WHILE SEARCHING FOR CERES HAD CAREFULLY MAPPED THE PART OF THE HEAVENS WHERE IT WAS EXPECTED
5261-19371-0024 AND IN MARCH EIGHTEEN O TWO HE SAW IN THIS PLACE A STAR HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY NOTICED IN TWO HOURS HE DETECTED ITS MOTION AND IN A MONTH HE SENT HIS OBSERVATIONS TO GAUSS WHO RETURNED AS ANSWER THE CALCULATED ORBIT
5261-19371-0025 IT WAS DISTANT TWO POINT SIX SEVEN LIKE CERES AND WAS A LITTLE SMALLER BUT IT HAD A VERY EXCENTRIC ORBIT
5261-19371-0026 IN THE COURSE OF CHARTING THE REGION OF THE HEAVENS TRAVERSED BY CERES AND PALLAS IT WAS SMALLER THAN EITHER AND WAS CALLED JUNO IN EIGHTEEN O SEVEN THE PERSEVERING SEARCH OF OLBERS RESULTED IN THE DISCOVERY OF ANOTHER WITH A VERY OBLIQUE ORBIT
5261-19371-0027 WHICH GAUSS NAMED VESTA VESTA IS BIGGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS BEING FIVE HUNDRED MILES IN DIAMETER AND SHINES LIKE A STAR OF THE SIXTH MAGNITUDE
5261-19371-0028 GAUSS BY THIS TIME HAD BECOME SO PRACTISED IN THE DIFFICULT COMPUTATIONS THAT HE WORKED OUT THE COMPLETE ORBIT OF VESTA WITHIN TEN HOURS OF RECEIVING THE OBSERVATIONAL DATA FROM OLBERS
5261-19371-0029 FOR MANY WEARY YEARS OLBERS KEPT UP A PATIENT AND UNREMITTING SEARCH FOR MORE OF THESE SMALL BODIES OR FRAGMENTS OF THE LARGE PLANET AS HE THOUGHT THEM BUT HIS PATIENCE WENT UNREWARDED AND HE DIED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY WITHOUT SEEING OR KNOWING OF ANY MORE
5261-19371-0030 WHERE PROFESSORS PETERS AND WATSON HAVE MADE A SPECIALTY OF THEM AND HAVE THEMSELVES FOUND SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED VESTA IS THE LARGEST
5261-19371-0031 WITHOUT RUSSIA OR SPAIN AND THE SMALLEST KNOWN IS ABOUT TWENTY MILES IN DIAMETER OR WITH A SURFACE ABOUT THE SIZE OF KENT THE WHOLE OF THEM TOGETHER DO NOT NEARLY EQUAL THE EARTH IN BULK THE MAIN INTEREST OF THESE BODIES TO US LIES IN THE QUESTION
5261-19371-0032 WHAT IS THEIR HISTORY CAN THEY HAVE BEEN ONCE A SINGLE PLANET BROKEN UP OR ARE THEY RATHER AN ABORTIVE ATTEMPT AT A PLANET NEVER YET FORMED INTO ONE THE QUESTION IS NOT ENTIRELY SETTLED BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHICH WAY OPINION STRONGLY TENDS AT THE PRESENT TIME
5261-19371-0033 AND WOULD COMPLETE ITS ORBIT QUITE UNDISTURBED EACH FRAGMENT WOULD DESCRIBE AN ORBIT OF ITS OWN BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY A DIFFERENT INITIAL VELOCITY BUT EVERY ORBIT WOULD BE A SIMPLE ELLIPSE AND CONSEQUENTLY EVERY PIECE WOULD IN TIME RETURN THROUGH ITS STARTING POINT
5261-19371-0034 A ZONE EVERYWHERE AS BROAD AS THE EARTH'S DISTANCE FROM THE SUN NINETY TWO MILLION MILES WITH NO SORT OF LAW INDICATING AN ORIGIN OF THIS KIND IT MUST BE ADMITTED HOWEVER THAT THE FRAGMENTS OF OUR SUPPOSED SHELL
5261-19371-0035 MIGHT IN THE COURSE OF AGES IF LEFT TO THEMSELVES MUTUALLY PERTURB EACH OTHER INTO A DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENT OF ORBITS FROM THAT WITH WHICH THEY BEGAN BUT THEIR PERTURBATIONS WOULD BE VERY MINUTE AND MOREOVER ON LAPLACE'S THEORY WOULD ONLY RESULT IN PERIODIC CHANGES
5261-19371-0036 PROVIDED EACH MASS WERE RIGID IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ASTEROIDS WERE AT ONE TIME NOT RIGID AND HENCE IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM BUT THERE IS NOT THE LEAST REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR PRESENT ARRANGEMENT IS DERIVABLE IN ANY WAY FROM AN EXPLOSION
5261-19371-0037 AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT AN ENORMOUS TIME MUST HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SUCH AN EVENT IF IT EVER OCCURRED IT IS FAR MORE PROBABLE THAT THEY NEVER CONSTITUTED ONE BODY AT ALL BUT ARE THE REMAINS OF A CLOUDY RING THROWN OFF BY THE SOLAR SYSTEM IN SHRINKING PAST THAT POINT
5261-19371-0038 A SMALL RING AFTER THE IMMENSE EFFORT WHICH PRODUCED JUPITER AND HIS SATELLITES A RING WHICH HAS AGGREGATED INTO A MULTITUDE OF LITTLE LUMPS INSTEAD OF A FEW BIG ONES SUCH AN EVENT IS NOT UNIQUE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM THERE IS A SIMILAR RING ROUND SATURN
5261-19371-0039 AT FIRST SIGHT AND TO ORDINARY CAREFUL INSPECTION THIS DIFFERS FROM THE ZONE OF ASTEROIDS IN BEING A SOLID LUMP OF MATTER LIKE A QUOIT BUT IT IS EASY TO SHOW FROM THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION THAT A SOLID RING COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE STABLE
5261-19371-0040 BUT WOULD BEFORE LONG GET PRECIPITATED EXCENTRICALLY UPON THE BODY OF THE PLANET DEVICES HAVE BEEN INVENTED SUCH AS ARTFULLY DISTRIBUTED IRREGULARITIES CALCULATED TO ACT AS SATELLITES AND MAINTAIN STABILITY BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS REALLY WORK
5261-19371-0041 NOR WILL IT DO TO IMAGINE THE RINGS FLUID THEY TOO WOULD DESTROY EACH OTHER THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF A SYSTEM OF RINGS ON DIFFERENT HYPOTHESES AS TO THEIR CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN WORKED OUT WITH CONSUMMATE SKILL BY CLERK MAXWELL
5261-19371-0042 WHO FINDS THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE CONSTITUTION FOR SATURN'S ASSEMBLAGE OF RINGS IS A MULTITUDE OF DISCRETE PARTICLES EACH PURSUING ITS INDEPENDENT ORBIT SATURN'S RING IS IN FACT A VERY CONCENTRATED ZONE OF MINOR ASTEROIDS
5261-19371-0043 AND THERE IS EVERY REASON TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR ASTEROIDS CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THE ORIGIN OF THE SATURNIAN ONES THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS LENDS ITSELF READILY TO BOTH THE INTERLOCKINGS AND MOTIONS OF THE PARTICLES IN SATURN'S RINGS ARE MOST BEAUTIFUL
5261-19371-0044 AND HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AND STATED BY MAXWELL WITH MARVELLOUS COMPLETENESS HIS PAPER CONSTITUTED WHAT IS CALLED THE ADAMS PRIZE ESSAY FOR EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX SIR GEORGE AIRY ONE OF THE ADJUDICATORS RECENTLY ASTRONOMER ROYAL
5261-19371-0045 CHARACTERIZED IT AS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE APPLICATIONS OF MATHEMATICS TO PHYSICS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTINCT CONSTITUENT RINGS IN THE ENTIRE SATURNIAN ZONE AND EACH PERTURBS THE OTHER WITH THE RESULT THAT THEY RIPPLE AND PULSE IN CONCORD
5261-19371-0046 THE WAVES THUS FORMED ABSORB THE EFFECT OF THE MUTUAL PERTURBATIONS AND PREVENT AN ACCUMULATION WHICH WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO THE PERSISTENCE OF THE WHOLE THE ONLY EFFECT OF GRAVITATIONAL PERTURBATION AND OF COLLISIONS IS GRADUALLY TO BROADEN OUT THE WHOLE RING
