4174-107938-0000 HAVING EXPLAINED THE EFFECTS OF WAVES OF LIGHT WHICH SPREAD IN A HOMOGENEOUS MATTER WE WILL EXAMINE NEXT THAT WHICH HAPPENS TO THEM ON ENCOUNTERING OTHER BODIES
4174-107938-0001 WE WILL FIRST MAKE EVIDENT HOW THE REFLEXION OF LIGHT IS EXPLAINED BY THESE SAME WAVES AND WHY IT PRESERVES EQUALITY OF ANGLES LET THERE BE A SURFACE A B PLANE AND POLISHED
4174-107938-0002 OF SOME METAL GLASS OR OTHER BODY WHICH AT FIRST I WILL CONSIDER AS PERFECTLY UNIFORM RESERVING TO MYSELF TO DEAL AT THE END OF THIS DEMONSTRATION WITH THE INEQUALITIES FROM WHICH IT CANNOT BE EXEMPT
4174-107938-0003 REPRESENT A PORTION OF A WAVE OF LIGHT THE CENTRE OF WHICH IS SO DISTANT THAT THIS PORTION AC MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A STRAIGHT LINE FOR I CONSIDER ALL THIS AS IN ONE PLANE
4174-107938-0004 IMAGINING TO MYSELF THAT THE PLANE IN WHICH THIS FIGURE IS CUTS THE SPHERE OF THE WAVE THROUGH ITS CENTRE AND INTERSECTS THE PLANE A B AT RIGHT ANGLES
4174-107938-0005 WILL IN A CERTAIN SPACE OF TIME ADVANCE AS FAR AS THE PLANE A B AT B FOLLOWING THE STRAIGHT LINE C B WHICH MAY BE SUPPOSED TO COME FROM THE LUMINOUS CENTRE AND WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE IS PERPENDICULAR TO AC
4174-107938-0006 NOW IN THIS SAME SPACE OF TIME THE PORTION A OF THE SAME WAVE WHICH HAS BEEN HINDERED FROM COMMUNICATING ITS MOVEMENT BEYOND THE PLANE A B OR AT LEAST PARTLY SO
4174-107938-0007 MAKING ITS OWN PARTIAL SPHERICAL WAVE ACCORDING TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE WHICH WAVE IS HERE REPRESENTED BY THE CIRCUMFERENCE S N R THE CENTRE OF WHICH IS A AND ITS SEMI DIAMETER
4174-107938-0008 EQUAL TO C B IF ONE CONSIDERS FURTHER THE OTHER PIECES H OF THE WAVE AC IT APPEARS THAT THEY WILL NOT ONLY HAVE REACHED THE SURFACE A B BY STRAIGHT LINES H K
4174-107938-0009 THAT IS TO SAY TO THE CONTINUATIONS OF H K
4174-107938-0010 BUT ALL THESE CIRCUMFERENCES HAVE AS A COMMON TANGENT THE STRAIGHT LINE B N NAMELY THE SAME WHICH IS DRAWN FROM B AS A TANGENT TO THE FIRST OF THE CIRCLES OF WHICH A IS THE CENTRE
4174-107938-0011 COMPRISED BETWEEN B AND THE POINT N WHERE THE PERPENDICULAR FROM THE POINT A FALLS
4174-107938-0012 WHICH IS AS IT WERE FORMED BY ALL THESE CIRCUMFERENCES AND WHICH TERMINATES THE MOVEMENT WHICH IS MADE BY THE REFLEXION OF THE WAVE AC
4174-107938-0013 AND IT IS ALSO THE PLACE WHERE THE MOVEMENT OCCURS IN MUCH GREATER QUANTITY THAN ANYWHERE ELSE WHEREFORE ACCORDING TO THAT WHICH HAS BEEN EXPLAINED
4174-107938-0014 B N IS THE PROPAGATION OF THE WAVE AC AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE PIECE C OF IT HAS ARRIVED AT B FOR THERE IS NO OTHER LINE WHICH LIKE B N IS A COMMON TANGENT TO ALL THE AFORESAID CIRCLES
4174-107938-0015 AND IF ONE WISHES TO SEE HOW THE WAVE AC HAS COME SUCCESSIVELY TO B N
4174-107938-0016 FOR THE TRIANGLES ACB B N A BEING RECTANGULAR AND HAVING THE SIDE A B COMMON
4174-107938-0017 MARKS THE DIRECTION OF THE REFLECTED RAY HENCE THESE RAYS ARE EQUALLY INCLINED TO THE PLANE A B BUT IN CONSIDERING THE PRECEDING DEMONSTRATION
4174-107938-0018 ONE MIGHT AVER THAT IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT B N IS THE COMMON TANGENT OF THE CIRCULAR WAVES IN THE PLANE OF THIS FIGURE BUT THAT THESE WAVES BEING IN TRUTH SPHERICAL HAVE STILL AN INFINITUDE OF SIMILAR TANGENTS
4174-107938-0019 NAMELY ALL THE STRAIGHT LINES WHICH ARE DRAWN FROM THE POINT B IN THE SURFACE
4174-107938-0020 I SAY THEN THAT THE WAVE AC BEING REGARDED ONLY AS A LINE PRODUCES NO LIGHT FOR A VISIBLE RAY OF LIGHT HOWEVER NARROW IT MAY BE HAS ALWAYS SOME WIDTH
4174-107938-0021 AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS NECESSARY IN REPRESENTING THE WAVE WHOSE PROGRESSION CONSTITUTES THE RAY TO PUT INSTEAD OF A LINE AC SOME PLANE FIGURE SUCH AS THE CIRCLE HC IN THE FOLLOWING FIGURE
4174-107938-0022 BY SUPPOSING AS WE HAVE DONE THE LUMINOUS POINT TO BE INFINITELY DISTANT NOW IT IS EASY TO SEE FOLLOWING THE PRECEDING DEMONSTRATION
4174-107938-0023 THAT EACH SMALL PIECE OF THIS WAVE HC HAVING ARRIVED AT THE PLANE A B AND THERE GENERATING EACH ONE ITS PARTICULAR WAVE THESE WILL ALL HAVE WHEN C ARRIVES AT B
4174-107938-0024 A COMMON PLANE WHICH WILL TOUCH THEM NAMELY A CIRCLE B N SIMILAR TO C H AND THIS WILL BE INTERSECTED AT ITS MIDDLE AND AT RIGHT ANGLES BY THE SAME PLANE WHICH LIKEWISE INTERSECTS THE CIRCLE C H
4174-107938-0025 CANNOT HAVE ANY COMMON TANGENT PLANE OTHER THAN THE CIRCLE B N SO THAT IT WILL BE THIS PLANE WHERE THERE WILL BE MORE REFLECTED MOVEMENT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
4174-107938-0026 AND WHICH WILL THEREFORE CARRY ON THE LIGHT IN CONTINUANCE FROM THE WAVE C H I HAVE ALSO STATED IN THE PRECEDING DEMONSTRATION
4174-107938-0027 IS NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE ITSELF BEYOND THE PLANE A B OR AT LEAST NOT WHOLLY
4174-107938-0028 WHENCE IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THOUGH THE MOVEMENT OF THE ETHEREAL MATTER MIGHT COMMUNICATE ITSELF PARTLY TO THAT OF THE REFLECTING BODY THIS COULD IN NOTHING ALTER THE VELOCITY OF PROGRESSION OF THE WAVES
4174-107938-0029 THIS COMES ABOUT FROM THE PROPERTY OF BODIES WHICH ACT AS SPRINGS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOVE NAMELY THAT WHETHER COMPRESSED LITTLE OR MUCH THEY RECOIL IN EQUAL TIMES
4174-107938-0030 EQUALLY SO IN EVERY REFLEXION OF THE LIGHT AGAINST WHATEVER BODY IT MAY BE THE ANGLES OF REFLEXION AND INCIDENCE OUGHT TO BE EQUAL NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE BODY MIGHT BE OF SUCH A NATURE
4174-107938-0031 THAT IT TAKES AWAY A PORTION OF THE MOVEMENT MADE BY THE INCIDENT LIGHT AND EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT IN FACT THERE IS NO POLISHED BODY THE REFLEXION OF WHICH DOES NOT FOLLOW THIS RULE
4174-107938-0032 IS THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE REFLECTING SURFACE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A UNIFORM PLANE AS HAS BEEN SUPPOSED BY ALL THOSE WHO HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE EFFECTS OF REFLEXION
4174-107938-0033 BUT ONLY AN EVENNESS SUCH AS MAY BE ATTAINED BY THE PARTICLES OF THE MATTER OF THE REFLECTING BODY BEING SET NEAR TO ONE ANOTHER WHICH PARTICLES ARE LARGER THAN THOSE OF THE ETHEREAL MATTER
4174-107938-0034 AS WILL APPEAR BY WHAT WE SHALL SAY IN TREATING OF THE TRANSPARENCY AND OPACITY OF BODIES FOR THE SURFACE CONSISTING THUS OF PARTICLES PUT TOGETHER AND THE ETHEREAL PARTICLES BEING ABOVE AND SMALLER
4174-107938-0035 IT IS EVIDENT THAT ONE COULD NOT DEMONSTRATE THE EQUALITY OF THE ANGLES OF INCIDENCE AND REFLEXION BY SIMILITUDE TO THAT WHICH HAPPENS TO A BALL THROWN AGAINST A WALL OF WHICH WRITERS HAVE ALWAYS MADE USE
4174-107938-0036 IN OUR WAY ON THE OTHER HAND THE THING IS EXPLAINED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY FOR THE SMALLNESS OF THE PARTICLES OF QUICKSILVER FOR EXAMPLE BEING SUCH THAT ONE MUST CONCEIVE MILLIONS OF THEM IN THE SMALLEST VISIBLE SURFACE PROPOSED
4174-107938-0037 ARRANGED LIKE A HEAP OF GRAINS OF SAND WHICH HAS BEEN FLATTENED AS MUCH AS IT IS CAPABLE OF BEING THIS SURFACE THEN BECOMES FOR OUR PURPOSE AS EVEN AS A POLISHED GLASS IS
4174-107938-0038 AND ALTHOUGH IT ALWAYS REMAINS ROUGH WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICLES OF THE ETHER IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE CENTRES OF ALL THE PARTICULAR SPHERES OF REFLEXION OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN ARE ALMOST IN ONE UNIFORM PLANE
