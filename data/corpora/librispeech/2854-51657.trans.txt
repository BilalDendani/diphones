2854-51657-0000 FOR A LONG TIME AFFAIRS AT CROTONA RAN ALONG IN THIS MANNER AND EUMOLPUS FLUSHED WITH SUCCESS SO FAR FORGOT THE FORMER STATE OF HIS FORTUNES THAT HE EVEN BRAGGED TO HIS FOLLOWERS
2854-51657-0001 SOME WILY LEGACY HUNTER SHOULD DISPATCH AN AGENT TO AFRICA AND CATCH US IN OUR LIE OR EVEN SUPPOSE THE HIRELING SERVANT GLUTTED WITH PROSPERITY SHOULD TIP OFF HIS CRONIES OR GIVE THE WHOLE SCHEME AWAY OUT OF SPITE
2854-51657-0002 THEY ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR WHAT IS COMING TO THEM TURNING THESE POSSIBILITIES OVER IN MY MIND I LEFT THE HOUSE IN A STATE OF BLACK MELANCHOLY HOPING TO REVIVE MY SPIRITS IN THE FRESH AIR BUT SCARCELY
2854-51657-0003 THE NAME I HAD ASSUMED SINCE MY METAMORPHOSIS INFORMED ME THAT HER MISTRESS DESIRED LEAVE TO SPEAK WITH ME
2854-51657-0004 WHY THAT GAIT SO PRECISE THAT NOT A FOOTSTEP DEVIATES FROM ITS PLACE UNLESS YOU WISH TO SHOW OFF YOUR FIGURE IN ORDER TO SELL YOUR FAVORS LOOK AT ME I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT OMENS AND I DON'T STUDY THE HEAVENS LIKE THE ASTROLOGERS
2854-51657-0005 BUT I CAN READ MEN'S INTENTIONS IN THEIR FACES AND I KNOW WHAT A FLIRT IS AFTER WHEN I SEE HIM OUT FOR A STROLL SO IF YOU'LL SELL US WHAT I WANT THERE'S A BUYER READY BUT IF YOU WILL DO THE GRACEFUL THING AND LEND
2854-51657-0006 MY MISTRESS BELONGS TO THIS CLASS SHE JUMPS THE FOURTEEN ROWS FROM THE STAGE TO THE GALLERY AND LOOKS FOR A LOVER AMONG THE GALLERY GODS AT THE BACK PUFFED UP WITH THIS DELIGHTFUL CHATTER COME NOW CONFESS WON'T YOU I QUERIED
2854-51657-0007 IS THIS LADY WHO LOVES ME YOURSELF THE WAITING MAID SMILED BROADLY AT THIS BLUNT SPEECH DON'T HAVE SUCH A HIGH OPINION OF YOURSELF SAID SHE I'VE NEVER GIVEN IN TO ANY SERVANT YET
2854-51657-0008 THE GODS FORBID THAT I SHOULD EVER THROW MY ARMS AROUND A GALLOWS BIRD LET THE MARRIED WOMEN SEE TO THAT AND KISS THE MARKS OF THE SCOURGE IF THEY LIKE
2854-51657-0009 EVEN IF I AM ONLY A SERVANT I COULD NOT HELP MARVELING FOR MY PART AT SUCH DISCORDANT PASSIONS AND I THOUGHT IT NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE THAT THIS SERVANT SHOULD POSSESS THE HAUTEUR OF THE MISTRESS
2854-51657-0010 AND CONDUCTED HER TO MY SIDE A WOMAN MORE PERFECT THAN ANY STATUE THERE ARE NO WORDS WITH WHICH TO DESCRIBE HER FORM AND ANYTHING I COULD SAY WOULD FALL FAR SHORT HER HAIR NATURALLY WAVY
2854-51657-0011 FLOWED COMPLETELY OVER HER SHOULDERS HER FOREHEAD WAS LOW AND THE ROOTS OF HER HAIR WERE BRUSHED BACK FROM IT HER EYEBROWS RUNNING FROM THE VERY SPRINGS OF HER CHEEKS
2854-51657-0012 BRIGHTER THAN STARS SHINING IN A MOONLESS NIGHT HER NOSE
2854-51657-0013 AND HER MOUTH WAS SUCH AN ONE AS PRAXITELES DREAMED DIANA HAD HER CHIN HER NECK HER HANDS
2854-51657-0014 THOUGHT LIGHTLY OF DORIS OH JOVE WHAT'S COME TO PASS THAT THOU THINE ARMOR CAST AWAY ART MUTE IN HEAVEN AND BUT AN IDLE TALE AT SUCH A TIME THE HORNS SHOULD SPROUT THE RAGING BULL HOLD SWAY
2854-51657-0015 I OFFER YOU A SISTER SAID SHE YOU HAVE A BROTHER ALREADY I KNOW FOR I DIDN'T DISDAIN TO ASK
2854-51657-0016 I WILL COME IN ON THE SAME FOOTING ONLY DEEM MY KISSES WORTHY OF RECOGNITION AND CARESS ME AT YOUR OWN PLEASURE RATHER LET ME IMPLORE YOU BY YOUR BEAUTY I REPLIED
2854-51657-0017 IF YOU PERMIT ME TO KNEEL BEFORE YOUR SHRINE YOU WILL FIND ME A TRUE VOTARY AND THAT YOU MAY NOT THINK I APPROACH THIS TEMPLE OF LOVE WITHOUT A GIFT I MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF MY BROTHER WHAT SHE EXCLAIMED WOULD YOU REALLY SACRIFICE THE ONLY ONE
2854-51657-0018 WITHOUT WHOM YOU COULD NOT LIVE THE ONE UPON WHOSE KISSES YOUR HAPPINESS DEPENDS HIM WHOM YOU LOVE AS I WOULD HAVE YOU LOVE ME SUCH SWEETNESS PERMEATED HER VOICE AS SHE SAID THIS
2854-51657-0019 THAT YOU WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THE SIRENS HARMONIES WERE FLOATING IN THE BREEZE I WAS STRUCK WITH WONDER AND DAZZLED BY I KNOW NOT WHAT LIGHT THAT SHONE UPON ME BRIGHTER THAN THE WHOLE HEAVEN BUT I MADE BOLD TO INQUIRE THE NAME OF MY DIVINITY WHY
2854-51657-0020 SHE REPLIED BUT I AM NOT THE SUN CHILD NOR HAS MY MOTHER EVER STAYED THE REVOLVING WORLD IN ITS COURSE AT HER PLEASURE BUT IF THE FATES BRING US TWO TOGETHER I WILL OWE HEAVEN A FAVOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
2854-51657-0021 A GREAT TORCH IS ALWAYS FLAMING WHEN THESE NAMES MEET TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS THEN IF YOU WILL THERE'S NO PRYING STRANGER TO FEAR AND YOUR BROTHER IS FAR AWAY FROM THIS SPOT SO SAYING
2854-51657-0022 AND DREW ME TO THE GROUND WHICH WAS COVERED WITH COLORED FLOWERS WITH FLOWERS LIKE THESE DID MOTHER EARTH GREAT IDA'S SUMMIT STREW WHEN JUPITER HIS HEART AFLAME ENJOYED HIS LAWFUL LOVE THERE GLOWED THE ROSE THE FLOWERING RUSH
2854-51657-0023 THE VIOLET'S DEEP BLUE FROM OUT GREEN MEADOWS SNOW WHITE LILIES LAUGHED THEN FROM ABOVE THIS SETTING SUMMONED VENUS TO THE GREEN AND TENDER SOD BRIGHT DAY SMILED KINDLY
2854-51657-0024 SIDE BY SIDE UPON THE GRASSY PLOT WE LAY EXCHANGING A THOUSAND KISSES THE PRELUDE TO MORE POIGNANT PLEASURE BUT ALAS MY SUDDEN LOSS OF VIGOR DISAPPOINTED CIRCE
2854-51657-0025 IS THERE ANY EVIL SMELLING PERSPIRATION IN MY ARMPITS OR IF IT'S NOTHING OF THIS KIND
2854-51657-0026 UNDER HER EYES I FLUSHED HOTLY AND IF I HAD ANY VIRILITY LEFT I LOST IT THEN MY WHOLE BODY SEEMED TO BE INERT MY QUEEN I CRIED DO NOT MOCK ME IN MY HUMILIATION I AM BEWITCHED
2854-51657-0027 CIRCE'S ANGER WAS FAR FROM BEING APPEASED BY SUCH A TRIVIAL EXCUSE TURNING HER EYES CONTEMPTUOUSLY AWAY FROM ME SHE LOOKED AT HER MAID TELL ME CHRYSIS AND TELL ME TRULY IS THERE ANYTHING REPULSIVE ABOUT ME ANYTHING SLUTTISH
2854-51657-0028 HAVE I SOME NATURAL BLEMISH THAT DISFIGURES MY BEAUTY DON'T DECEIVE YOUR MISTRESS I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH US BUT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THEN SHE SNATCHED A MIRROR FROM THE SILENT MAID AND AFTER SCRUTINIZING ALL THE LOOKS AND SMILES WHICH PASS BETWEEN LOVERS
2854-51657-0029 SHE SHOOK OUT HER WRINKLED EARTH STAINED ROBE AND FLOUNCED OFF INTO THE TEMPLE OF VENUS NEARBY AND HERE WAS I LIKE A CONVICTED CRIMINAL WHO HAD SEEN SOME HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE ASKING MYSELF WHETHER THE PLEASURE OUT OF WHICH I HAD BEEN CHEATED WAS A REALITY
2854-51657-0030 OR ONLY A DREAM AS WHEN IN THE SLEEP BRINGING NIGHT DREAMS SPORT WITH THE WANDERING EYES AND EARTH SPADED UP
2854-51657-0031 THESE ENCHANTMENTS BY WHICH HE'S OBSESSED AND TRUTH COMES AGAIN WITH HER TRAIN RESTORING PERSPECTIVE AND PAIN THE PHANTASM LIVES TO THE LAST THE MIND DWELLS WITH SHADES OF THE PAST THE MISFORTUNE SEEMED TO ME A DREAM
2854-51657-0032 BUT I IMAGINED THAT I MUST SURELY BE UNDER A SPELL OF ENCHANTMENT AND FOR A LONG TIME I WAS SO DEVOID OF STRENGTH THAT I COULD NOT GET TO MY FEET BUT FINALLY MY MENTAL DEPRESSION BEGAN TO ABATE LITTLE BY LITTLE MY STRENGTH CAME BACK TO ME
2854-51657-0033 AND I RETURNED HOME ARRIVED THERE I FEIGNED ILLNESS AND THREW MYSELF UPON MY COUCH A LITTLE LATE GITON WHO HAD HEARD OF MY INDISPOSITION ENTERED THE ROOM IN SOME CONCERN AS I WISHED TO RELIEVE HIS MIND
2854-51657-0034 I INFORMED HIM THAT I HAD MERELY SOUGHT MY PALLET TO TAKE A REST TELLING HIM MUCH OTHER GOSSIP BUT NOT A WORD ABOUT MY MISHAP AS I STOOD IN GREAT FEAR OF HIS JEALOUSY AND TO LULL ANY SUSPICION WHICH HE MIGHT ENTERTAIN I DREW HIM TO MY SIDE
2854-51657-0035 AND ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE HIM SOME PROOFS OF MY LOVE BUT ALL MY PANTING AND SWEATING WERE IN VAIN HE JUMPED UP IN A RAGE AND ACCUSED MY LACK OF VIRILITY AND CHANGE OF HEART
2854-51657-0036 NO NO DARLING I REPLIED MY LOVE FOR YOU HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME BUT REASON PREVAILS NOW OVER LOVE AND WANTONNESS AND FOR THE SOCRATIC CONTINENCE OF YOUR LOVE I THANK YOU IN HIS NAME HE REPLIED SARCASTICALLY

2854-51657-0038 DEAD AND BURIED LIES THAT PART IN WHICH I WAS ONCE AN ACHILLES
2854-51657-0039 AND HANDED ME HER MISTRESS'S TABLETS IN WHICH WERE WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING WORDS
2854-51657-0040 GREETING WERE I A WANTON I SHOULD COMPLAIN OF MY DISAPPOINTMENT BUT AS IT IS
2854-51657-0041 FOR BY IT I DALLIED THE LONGER IN THE SHADOW OF PLEASURE STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE AND WHETHER YOU GOT HOME UPON YOUR OWN LEGS FOR THE DOCTORS SAY THAT ONE CANNOT WALK WITHOUT NERVES YOUNG MAN

2854-51657-0044 DO NOT LIE FAREWELL IF YOU CAN SUCH THINGS WILL HAPPEN SAID CHRYSIS WHEN SHE SAW THAT I HAD READ THROUGH THE ENTIRE INDITEMENT
2854-51657-0045 DEAR LADY I CONFESS THAT I HAVE OFTEN GIVEN CAUSE FOR OFFENSE FOR I AM ONLY A MAN AND A YOUNG ONE TOO BUT I NEVER COMMITTED A DEADLY CRIME UNTIL TODAY YOU HAVE MY CONFESSION OF GUILT

2854-51657-0048 BY ASPIRING TO TOO MUCH IT IS LIKELY THAT I SPENT MY PLEASURE IN DELAY I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS YOU BID ME BEWARE OF PARALYSIS
2854-51657-0049 AND OMITTING THE BATH I ANNOINTED MYSELF IN MODERATION WITH UNGUENTS AND PLACED MYSELF UPON A MORE STRENGTHENING DIET SUCH AS ONIONS AND SNAIL'S HEADS WITHOUT CONDIMENTS AND I ALSO DRANK MORE SPARINGLY OF WINE THEN
2854-51657-0050 SO ANXIOUS WAS I TO PLEASE HER THAT I FEARED THE OUTCOME IF MY BROTHER LAY TICKLING MY SIDE CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIRST FINDING MYSELF VIGOROUS IN MIND AND BODY WHEN I AROSE NEXT MORNING
