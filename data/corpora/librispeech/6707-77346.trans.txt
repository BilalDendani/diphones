6707-77346-0000 I CONCEIVED THE DESIRE OF WRITING A BOOK TO SCRIBBLE SECRETLY AND DREAM OF AUTHORSHIP WAS ONE OF MY CHIEF ALLEVIATIONS AND I READ WITH A SYMPATHETIC ENVY EVERY SCRAP
6707-77346-0001 I COULD GET ABOUT THE WORLD OF LITERATURE AND THE LIVES OF LITERARY PEOPLE IT IS SOMETHING EVEN AMIDST THIS PRESENT HAPPINESS TO FIND LEISURE AND OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE UP AND PARTIALLY REALIZE THESE OLD AND HOPELESS DREAMS
6707-77346-0002 WOULD NOT I THINK SUFFICE TO SET ME AT THIS DESK I FIND SOME SUCH RECAPITULATION OF MY PAST AS THIS WILL INVOLVE IS BECOMING NECESSARY TO MY OWN SECURE MENTAL CONTINUITY
6707-77346-0003 THE PASSAGE OF YEARS BRINGS A MAN AT LAST TO RETROSPECTION AT SEVENTY TWO ONE'S YOUTH IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT WAS AT FORTY AND I AM OUT OF TOUCH WITH MY YOUTH
6707-77346-0004 THE OLD LIFE SEEMS SO CUT OFF FROM THE NEW SO ALIEN AND SO UNREASONABLE THAT AT TIMES I FIND IT BORDERING UPON THE INCREDIBLE THE DATA HAVE GONE THE BUILDINGS AND PLACES
6707-77346-0005 I STOPPED DEAD THE OTHER AFTERNOON IN MY WALK ACROSS THE MOOR WHERE ONCE THE DISMAL OUTSKIRTS OF SWATHINGLEA STRAGGLED TOWARD LEET
6707-77346-0006 AND LOADED MY REVOLVER READY FOR MURDER DID EVER SUCH A THING HAPPEN IN MY LIFE WAS SUCH A MOOD AND THOUGHT AND INTENTION EVER POSSIBLE TO ME
6707-77346-0007 RATHER HAS NOT SOME QUEER NIGHTMARE SPIRIT OUT OF DREAMLAND SLIPPED A PSEUDO MEMORY INTO THE RECORDS OF MY VANISHED LIFE
6707-77346-0008 AND I THINK TOO THAT THOSE WHO ARE NOW GROWING UP TO TAKE OUR PLACES IN THE GREAT ENTERPRISE OF MANKIND WILL NEED MANY SUCH NARRATIVES AS MINE FOR EVEN THE MOST PARTIAL CONCEPTION OF THE OLD WORLD OF SHADOWS THAT CAME BEFORE OUR DAY
6707-77346-0009 I WAS CAUGHT MIDWAY IN A GUST OF PASSION AND A CURIOUS ACCIDENT PUT ME FOR A TIME IN THE VERY NUCLEUS OF THE NEW ORDER
6707-77346-0010 TO A LITTLE ILL LIT ROOM WITH A SASH WINDOW OPEN TO A STARRY SKY AND INSTANTLY THERE RETURNS TO ME THE CHARACTERISTIC SMELL OF THAT ROOM THE PENETRATING ODOR OF AN ILL TRIMMED LAMP
6707-77346-0011 BURNING CHEAP PARAFFIN LIGHTING BY ELECTRICITY HAD THEN BEEN PERFECTED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS BUT STILL THE LARGER PORTION OF THE WORLD USED THESE LAMPS
6707-77346-0012 ALL THIS FIRST SCENE WILL GO IN MY MIND AT LEAST TO THAT OLFACTORY ACCOMPANIMENT THAT WAS THE EVENING SMELL OF THE ROOM BY DAY IT HAD A MORE SUBTLE AROMA A CLOSENESS
6707-77346-0013 LET ME DESCRIBE THIS ROOM TO YOU IN DETAIL IT WAS PERHAPS EIGHT FEET BY SEVEN IN AREA AND RATHER HIGHER THAN EITHER OF THESE DIMENSIONS THE CEILING WAS OF PLASTER CRACKED AND BULGING IN PLACES
6707-77346-0014 GRAY WITH THE SOOT OF THE LAMP AND IN ONE PLACE DISCOLORED BY A SYSTEM OF YELLOW AND OLIVE GREEN STAINS CAUSED BY THE PERCOLATION OF DAMP FROM ABOVE
6707-77346-0015 THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH DUN COLORED PAPER UPON WHICH HAD BEEN PRINTED IN OBLIQUE REITERATION A CRIMSON SHAPE SOMETHING OF THE NATURE OF A CURLY OSTRICH FEATHER OR AN ACANTHUS FLOWER
6707-77346-0016 THAT HAD IN ITS LESS FADED MOMENTS A SORT OF DINGY GAIETY THERE WERE SEVERAL BIG PLASTER RIMMED WOUNDS IN THIS
6707-77346-0017 CAUSED BY PARLOAD'S INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS TO GET NAILS INTO THE WALL WHEREBY THERE MIGHT HANG PICTURES ONE NAIL HAD HIT BETWEEN TWO BRICKS AND GOT HOME
6707-77346-0018 AND FROM THIS DEPENDED SUSTAINED A LITTLE INSECURELY BY FRAYED AND KNOTTED BLIND CORD PARLOAD'S HANGING BOOKSHELVES PLANKS PAINTED OVER WITH A TREACLY BLUE ENAMEL AND FURTHER DECORATED BY A FRINGE OF PINKED AMERICAN CLOTH
6707-77346-0019 INSECURELY FIXED BY TACKS BELOW THIS WAS A LITTLE TABLE THAT BEHAVED WITH A MULISH VINDICTIVENESS TO ANY KNEE THAT WAS THRUST BENEATH IT SUDDENLY
6707-77346-0020 HAD BEEN RENDERED LESS MONOTONOUS
6707-77346-0021 STOOD AND STANK THE LAMP THIS LAMP YOU MUST UNDERSTAND WAS OF SOME WHITISH TRANSLUCENT SUBSTANCE THAT WAS NEITHER CHINA NOR GLASS
6707-77346-0022 IT HAD A SHADE OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE A SHADE THAT DID NOT PROTECT THE EYES OF A READER IN ANY MEASURE AND IT SEEMED ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO BRING INTO PITILESS PROMINENCE THE FACT THAT
6707-77346-0023 AFTER THE LAMP'S TRIMMING DUST AND PARAFFIN HAD BEEN SMEARED OVER ITS EXTERIOR WITH A RECKLESS GENEROSITY THE UNEVEN FLOOR BOARDS OF THIS APARTMENT WERE COVERED WITH SCRATCHED ENAMEL OF CHOCOLATE HUE
6707-77346-0024 ON WHICH A SMALL ISLAND OF FRAYED CARPET DIMLY BLOSSOMED IN THE DUST AND SHADOWS THERE WAS A VERY SMALL GRATE MADE OF CAST IRON IN ONE PIECE AND PAINTED BUFF
6707-77346-0025 AND A STILL SMALLER MISFIT OF A CAST IRON FENDER THAT CONFESSED THE GRAY STONE OF THE HEARTH NO FIRE WAS LAID ONLY A FEW SCRAPS OF TORN PAPER AND THE BOWL OF A BROKEN CORN COB PIPE WERE VISIBLE BEHIND THE BARS
6707-77346-0026 AND IN THE CORNER AND RATHER THRUST AWAY WAS AN ANGULAR JAPANNED COAL BOX WITH A DAMAGED HINGE
6707-77346-0027 IT WAS THE CUSTOM IN THOSE DAYS TO WARM EVERY ROOM SEPARATELY FROM A SEPARATE FIREPLACE MORE PROLIFIC OF DIRT THAN HEAT AND THE RICKETY SASH WINDOW THE SMALL CHIMNEY AND THE LOOSE FITTING DOOR
6707-77346-0028 PARLOAD'S TRUCKLE BED HID ITS GRAY SHEETS BENEATH AN OLD PATCHWORK COUNTERPANE ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM AND VEILED HIS BOXES AND SUCHLIKE ODDMENTS
6707-77346-0029 AND INVADING THE TWO CORNERS OF THE WINDOW WERE AN OLD WHATNOT
6707-77346-0030 BY SOME ONE WITH AN EXCESS OF TURNERY APPLIANCES IN A HURRY WHO HAD TRIED TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE ROUGH ECONOMIES OF HIS WORKMANSHIP BY AN ARRESTING ORNAMENTATION OF BLOBS AND BULBS UPON THE JOINTS AND LEGS
6707-77346-0031 VARNISH AND A SET OF FLEXIBLE COMBS THIS PERSON HAD FIRST PAINTED THE ARTICLE THEN I FANCY SMEARED IT WITH VARNISH
6707-77346-0032 AND THEN SAT DOWN TO WORK WITH THE COMBS TO STREAK AND COMB THE VARNISH INTO A WEIRD IMITATION OF THE GRAIN OF SOME NIGHTMARE TIMBER
6707-77346-0033 THE WASHHANDSTAND SO MADE HAD EVIDENTLY HAD A PROLONGED CAREER OF VIOLENT USE HAD BEEN CHIPPED KICKED SPLINTERED PUNCHED STAINED SCORCHED HAMMERED DESSICATED
6707-77346-0034 DAMPED AND DEFILED HAD MET INDEED WITH ALMOST EVERY POSSIBLE ADVENTURE EXCEPT A CONFLAGRATION OR A SCRUBBING UNTIL AT LAST IT HAD COME TO THIS HIGH REFUGE OF PARLOAD'S ATTIC
6707-77346-0035 TO SUSTAIN THE SIMPLE REQUIREMENTS OF PARLOAD'S PERSONAL CLEANLINESS THERE WERE IN CHIEF A BASIN AND A JUG OF WATER AND A SLOP PAIL OF TIN AND FURTHER A PIECE OF YELLOW SOAP IN A TRAY A TOOTH BRUSH
6707-77346-0036 A RAT TAILED SHAVING BRUSH ONE HUCKABACK TOWEL AND ONE OR TWO OTHER MINOR ARTICLES IN THOSE DAYS ONLY VERY PROSPEROUS PEOPLE HAD MORE THAN SUCH AN EQUIPAGE
6707-77346-0037 AND IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT EVERY DROP OF WATER PARLOAD USED HAD TO BE CARRIED BY AN UNFORTUNATE SERVANT GIRL THE SLAVEY PARLOAD CALLED HER UP FROM THE BASEMENT
6707-77346-0038 TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE AND SUBSEQUENTLY DOWN AGAIN ALREADY WE BEGIN TO FORGET HOW MODERN AN INVENTION IS PERSONAL CLEANLINESS IT IS A FACT THAT PARLOAD HAD NEVER STRIPPED FOR A SWIM IN HIS LIFE
6707-77346-0039 NEVER HAD A SIMULTANEOUS BATH ALL OVER HIS BODY SINCE HIS CHILDHOOD NOT ONE IN FIFTY OF US DID IN THE DAYS OF WHICH I AM TELLING YOU A CHEST ALSO SINGULARLY GRAINED AND STREAKED
6707-77346-0040 OF TWO LARGE AND TWO SMALL DRAWERS HELD PARLOAD'S RESERVE OF GARMENTS AND PEGS ON THE DOOR CARRIED HIS TWO HATS AND COMPLETED THIS INVENTORY OF A BED SITTING ROOM AS I KNEW IT BEFORE THE CHANGE
6707-77346-0041 BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN THERE WAS ALSO A CHAIR WITH A SQUAB THAT APOLOGIZED INADEQUATELY FOR THE DEFECTS OF ITS CANE SEAT I FORGOT THAT FOR THE MOMENT BECAUSE I WAS SITTING ON THE CHAIR ON THE OCCASION THAT BEST BEGINS THIS STORY
6707-77346-0042 I HAVE DESCRIBED PARLOAD'S ROOM WITH SUCH PARTICULARITY BECAUSE IT WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE KEY IN WHICH MY EARLIER CHAPTERS ARE WRITTEN
6707-77346-0043 BUT YOU MUST NOT IMAGINE THAT THIS SINGULAR EQUIPMENT OR THE SMELL OF THE LAMP ENGAGED MY ATTENTION AT THAT TIME TO THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE
6707-77346-0044 I TOOK ALL THIS GRIMY UNPLEASANTNESS AS IF IT WERE THE MOST NATURAL AND PROPER SETTING FOR EXISTENCE IMAGINABLE IT WAS THE WORLD AS I KNEW IT
6707-77346-0045 MY MIND WAS ENTIRELY OCCUPIED THEN BY GRAVER AND INTENSER MATTERS
