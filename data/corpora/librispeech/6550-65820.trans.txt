6550-65820-0000 THE COMMON PEOPLE OF FRANCE HAVE A GREAT SUPERIORITY OVER THAT CLASS IN EVERY OTHER COUNTRY ON THIS VERY SCORE
6550-65820-0001 BOTH IN ENGLAND AND THE NORTHERN STATES OF EUROPE WHICH APPEARS TO BE THE GREATEST IMPEDIMENT TO GENERAL IMPROVEMENT DRINKING IS HERE THE PRINCIPAL RELAXATION OF THE MEN INCLUDING SMOKING BUT THE WOMEN ARE VERY ABSTEMIOUS
6550-65820-0002 THOUGH THEY HAVE NO PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS AS A SUBSTITUTE I OUGHT TO EXCEPT ONE THEATRE WHICH APPEARS MORE THAN IS NECESSARY FOR WHEN I WAS THERE IT WAS NOT HALF FULL AND NEITHER THE LADIES NOR ACTRESSES DISPLAYED MUCH FANCY IN THEIR DRESS
6550-65820-0003 WERE SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THE STATE OF THE DRAMATIC ART IN DENMARK AND THE GROSS TASTE OF THE AUDIENCE A MAGICIAN IN THE DISGUISE OF A TINKER ENTERS A COTTAGE WHERE THE WOMEN ARE ALL BUSY IRONING AND RUBS A DIRTY FRYING PAN AGAINST THE LINEN
6550-65820-0004 AND DANCE AFTER HIM ROUSING THEIR HUSBANDS WHO JOIN IN THE DANCE BUT GET THE START OF THEM IN THE PURSUIT THE TINKER WITH THE FRYING PAN FOR A SHIELD RENDERS THEM IMMOVABLE AND BLACKS THEIR CHEEKS EACH LAUGHS AT THE OTHER UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN APPEARANCE
6550-65820-0005 DISPLAYS A GLOOMY KIND OF GRANDEUR THROUGHOUT FOR THE SILENCE OF SPACIOUS APARTMENTS
6550-65820-0006 AND I LISTEN FOR THE SOUND OF MY FOOTSTEPS AS I HAVE DONE AT MIDNIGHT TO THE TICKING OF THE DEATH WATCH ENCOURAGING A KIND OF FANCIFUL SUPERSTITION EVERY OBJECT CARRIED ME BACK TO PAST TIMES
6550-65820-0007 AND IMPRESSED THE MANNERS OF THE AGE FORCIBLY ON MY MIND IN THIS POINT OF VIEW THE PRESERVATION OF OLD PALACES AND THEIR TARNISHED FURNITURE IS USEFUL FOR THEY MAY BE CONSIDERED AS HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS
6550-65820-0008 THE VACUUM LEFT BY DEPARTED GREATNESS WAS EVERYWHERE OBSERVABLE WHILST THE BATTLES AND PROCESSIONS PORTRAYED ON THE WALLS TOLD YOU WHO HAD HERE EXCITED REVELRY AFTER RETIRING FROM SLAUGHTER OR DISMISSED PAGEANTRY IN SEARCH OF PLEASURE
6550-65820-0009 IT SEEMED A VAST TOMB FULL OF THE SHADOWY PHANTOMS OF THOSE WHO HAD PLAYED OR TOILED THEIR HOUR OUT AND SUNK BEHIND THE TAPESTRY WHICH CELEBRATED THE CONQUESTS OF LOVE OR WAR COULD THEY BE NO MORE TO WHOM MY IMAGINATION THUS GAVE LIFE
6550-65820-0010 IT CANNOT BE AS EASILY COULD I BELIEVE THAT THE LARGE SILVER LIONS AT THE TOP OF THE BANQUETING ROOM THOUGHT AND REASONED BUT AVAUNT YE WAKING DREAMS YET I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE CURIOSITIES TO YOU
6550-65820-0011 IT IS A PITY THEY DO NOT LEND THEM TO THE ACTORS INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THEM TO PERISH INGLORIOUSLY I HAVE NOT VISITED ANY OTHER PALACE EXCEPTING HIRSHOLM THE GARDENS OF WHICH ARE LAID OUT WITH TASTE AND COMMAND THE FINEST VIEWS THE COUNTRY AFFORDS
6550-65820-0012 THE PUBLIC LIBRARY CONSISTS OF A COLLECTION MUCH LARGER THAN I EXPECTED TO SEE AND IT IS WELL ARRANGED OF THE VALUE OF THE ICELANDIC MANUSCRIPTS I COULD NOT FORM A JUDGMENT THOUGH THE ALPHABET OF SOME OF THEM AMUSED ME
6550-65820-0013 BY SHOWING WHAT IMMENSE LABOUR MEN WILL SUBMIT TO IN ORDER TO TRANSMIT THEIR IDEAS TO POSTERITY I HAVE SOMETIMES THOUGHT IT A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ACQUIRE A CERTAIN DELICACY OF SENTIMENT
6550-65820-0014 WHICH OFTEN MAKES THEM WEARY OF THE COMMON OCCURRENCES OF LIFE YET IT IS THIS VERY DELICACY OF FEELING AND THINKING WHICH PROBABLY HAS PRODUCED MOST OF THE PERFORMANCES THAT HAVE BENEFITED MANKIND IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY PERHAPS
6550-65820-0015 BE TERMED THE MALADY OF GENIUS THE CAUSE OF THAT CHARACTERISTIC MELANCHOLY WHICH GROWS WITH ITS GROWTH AND STRENGTHENS WITH ITS STRENGTH THERE ARE SOME GOOD PICTURES IN THE ROYAL MUSEUM
6550-65820-0016 DO NOT START I AM NOT GOING TO TROUBLE YOU WITH A DULL CATALOGUE OR STUPID CRITICISMS ON MASTERS TO WHOM TIME HAS ASSIGNED THEIR JUST NICHE IN THE TEMPLE OF FAME HAD THERE BEEN ANY BY LIVING ARTISTS OF THIS COUNTRY I SHOULD HAVE NOTICED THEM
6550-65820-0017 AS MAKING A PART OF THE SKETCHES I AM DRAWING OF THE PRESENT STATE OF THE PLACE THE GOOD PICTURES WERE MIXED INDISCRIMINATELY WITH THE BAD ONES IN ORDER TO ASSORT THE FRAMES THE SAME FAULT IS CONSPICUOUS IN THE NEW SPLENDID GALLERY FORMING AT PARIS
6550-65820-0018 THOUGH IT SEEMS AN OBVIOUS THOUGHT THAT A SCHOOL FOR ARTISTS OUGHT TO BE ARRANGED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO SHOW THE PROGRESSIVE DISCOVERIES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ART A COLLECTION OF THE DRESSES ARMS AND IMPLEMENTS OF THE LAPLANDERS ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION
6550-65820-0019 RENDERS THEM USEFUL BUT THIS MAY PARTLY HAVE BEEN OCCASIONED BY THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THE PALACE WHEN IN FLAMES THERE ARE SOME RESPECTABLE MEN OF SCIENCE HERE BUT FEW LITERARY CHARACTERS AND FEWER ARTISTS
6550-65820-0020 THEY WANT ENCOURAGEMENT AND WILL CONTINUE I FEAR FROM THE PRESENT APPEARANCE OF THINGS TO LANGUISH UNNOTICED A LONG TIME FOR NEITHER THE VANITY OF WEALTH NOR THE ENTERPRISING SPIRIT OF COMMERCE HAS YET THROWN A GLANCE THAT WAY
6550-65820-0021 BESIDES THE PRINCE ROYAL DETERMINED TO BE ECONOMICAL ALMOST DESCENDS TO PARSIMONY AND PERHAPS DEPRESSES HIS SUBJECTS BY LABOURING NOT TO OPPRESS THEM FOR HIS INTENTIONS ALWAYS SEEM TO BE GOOD
6550-65820-0022 YET NOTHING CAN GIVE A MORE FORCIBLE IDEA OF THE DULNESS WHICH EATS AWAY ALL ACTIVITY OF MIND THAN THE INSIPID ROUTINE OF A COURT WITHOUT MAGNIFICENCE OR ELEGANCE THE PRINCE FROM WHAT I CAN NOW COLLECT
6550-65820-0023 FINDS HIM AS TRACTABLE AS HE COULD WISH FOR I CONSIDER THE COUNT AS THE REAL SOVEREIGN SCARCELY BEHIND THE CURTAIN THE PRINCE HAVING NONE OF THAT OBSTINATE SELF SUFFICIENCY OF YOUTH SO OFTEN THE FORERUNNER OF DECISION OF CHARACTER
6550-65820-0024 SOME TERMAGANT WIVES MAKE OF THEIR HUSBANDS
6550-65820-0025 WHICH WAS FAR TOO GREAT FOR THE REVENUE OF THE CROWN THE PRINCE ROYAL AT PRESENT RUNS INTO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME AND THE FORMALITY IF NOT THE PARSIMONY OF THE COURT SEEMS TO EXTEND TO ALL THE OTHER BRANCHES OF SOCIETY WHICH I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF
6550-65820-0026 OBSERVING THOUGH HOSPITALITY STILL CHARACTERISES THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS BUT LET ME NOW STOP I MAY BE A LITTLE PARTIAL AND VIEW EVERYTHING WITH THE JAUNDICED EYE OF MELANCHOLY FOR I AM SAD AND HAVE CAUSE
