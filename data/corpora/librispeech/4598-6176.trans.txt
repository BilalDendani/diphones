4598-6176-0000 AS SOON AS SHE WAS LEFT ALONE AGNES SET TO WORK TIDYING AND DUSTING THE COTTAGE MADE UP THE FIRE WATERED THE BED AND CLEANED THE INSIDE OF THE WINDOWS THE WISE WOMAN HERSELF ALWAYS KEPT THE OUTSIDE OF THEM CLEAN
4598-6176-0001 WHEN SHE HAD DONE SHE FOUND HER DINNER OF THE SAME SORT SHE WAS USED TO AT HOME BUT BETTER IN THE HOLE OF THE WALL WHEN SHE HAD EATEN IT SHE WENT TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES BY THIS TIME HER OLD DISPOSITION HAD BEGUN TO ROUSE AGAIN
4598-6176-0002 SHE HAD BEEN DOING HER DUTY AND HAD IN CONSEQUENCE BEGUN AGAIN TO THINK HERSELF SOMEBODY HOWEVER STRANGE IT MAY WELL SEEM TO DO ONE'S DUTY WILL MAKE ANY ONE CONCEITED WHO ONLY DOES IT SOMETIMES
4598-6176-0003 THOSE WHO DO IT ALWAYS WOULD AS SOON THINK OF BEING CONCEITED OF EATING THEIR DINNER AS OF DOING THEIR DUTY WHAT HONEST BOY WOULD PRIDE HIMSELF ON NOT PICKING POCKETS A THIEF WHO WAS TRYING TO REFORM WOULD
4598-6176-0004 TO BE CONCEITED OF DOING ONE'S DUTY IS THEN A SIGN OF HOW LITTLE ONE DOES IT AND HOW LITTLE ONE SEES WHAT A CONTEMPTIBLE THING IT IS NOT TO DO IT COULD ANY BUT A LOW CREATURE BE CONCEITED OF NOT BEING CONTEMPTIBLE
4598-6176-0005 UNTIL OUR DUTY BECOMES TO US COMMON AS BREATHING WE ARE POOR CREATURES SO AGNES BEGAN TO STROKE HERSELF ONCE MORE FORGETTING HER LATE SELF STROKING COMPANION AND NEVER REFLECTING THAT SHE WAS NOW DOING WHAT SHE HAD THEN ABHORRED
4598-6176-0006 AND IN THIS MOOD SHE WENT INTO THE PICTURE GALLERY THE FIRST PICTURE SHE SAW REPRESENTED A SQUARE IN A GREAT CITY ONE SIDE OF WHICH WAS OCCUPIED BY A SPLENDID MARBLE PALACE WITH GREAT FLIGHTS OF BROAD STEPS LEADING UP TO THE DOOR
4598-6176-0007 BETWEEN IT AND THE SQUARE WAS A MARBLE PAVED COURT WITH GATES OF BRASS AT WHICH STOOD SENTRIES IN GORGEOUS UNIFORMS AND TO WHICH WAS AFFIXED THE FOLLOWING PROCLAMATION IN LETTERS OF GOLD LARGE ENOUGH FOR AGNES TO READ
4598-6176-0008 BY THE WILL OF THE KING FROM THIS TIME UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE EVERY STRAY CHILD FOUND IN THE REALM SHALL BE BROUGHT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY TO THE PALACE WHOEVER SHALL BE FOUND HAVING DONE OTHERWISE
4598-6176-0009 SHALL STRAIGHTWAY LOSE HIS HEAD BY THE HAND OF THE PUBLIC EXECUTIONER AGNES'S HEART BEAT LOUD AND HER FACE FLUSHED CAN THERE BE SUCH A CITY IN THE WORLD SHE SAID TO HERSELF
4598-6176-0010 IF I ONLY KNEW WHERE IT WAS I SHOULD SET OUT FOR IT AT ONCE THERE WOULD BE THE PLACE FOR A CLEVER GIRL LIKE ME HER EYES FELL ON THE PICTURE WHICH HAD SO ENTICED ROSAMOND IT WAS THE VERY COUNTRY WHERE HER FATHER FED HIS FLOCKS
4598-6176-0011 JUST ROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WAS THE COTTAGE WHERE HER PARENTS LIVED WHERE SHE WAS BORN AND WHENCE SHE HAD BEEN CARRIED BY THE BEGGAR WOMAN AH SHE SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW ME THERE THEY LITTLE THOUGHT WHAT I COULD BE IF I HAD THE CHANCE
4598-6176-0012 IF I WERE BUT IN THIS GOOD KIND LOVING GENEROUS KING'S PALACE I SHOULD SOON BE SUCH A GREAT LADY AS THEY NEVER SAW THEN THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT A GOOD LITTLE GIRL I HAD ALWAYS BEEN
4598-6176-0013 AND I SHOULDN'T FORGET MY POOR PARENTS LIKE SOME I HAVE READ OF I WOULD BE GENEROUS I SHOULD NEVER BE SELFISH AND PROUD LIKE GIRLS IN STORY BOOKS AS SHE SAID THIS SHE TURNED HER BACK WITH DISDAIN UPON THE PICTURE OF HER HOME
4598-6176-0014 STARED AT IT WITH WIDE AMBITIOUS EYES AND A HEART WHOSE EVERY BEAT WAS A THROB OF ARROGANT SELF ESTEEM THE SHEPHERD CHILD WAS NOW WORSE THAN EVER THE POOR PRINCESS HAD BEEN FOR THE WISE WOMAN HAD GIVEN HER A TERRIBLE LESSON
4598-6176-0015 ONE OF WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS NOT CAPABLE AND SHE HAD KNOWN WHAT IT MEANT YET HERE SHE WAS AS BAD AS EVER THEREFORE WORSE THAN BEFORE THE UGLY CREATURE WHOSE PRESENCE HAD MADE HER SO MISERABLE HAD INDEED CREPT OUT OF SIGHT
4598-6176-0016 AND MIND TOO BUT WHERE WAS SHE NESTLING IN HER VERY HEART WHERE MOST OF ALL SHE HAD HER COMPANY AND LEAST OF ALL COULD SEE HER THE WISE WOMAN HAD CALLED HER OUT THAT AGNES MIGHT SEE WHAT SORT OF CREATURE SHE WAS HERSELF
4598-6176-0017 BUT NOW SHE WAS SNUG IN HER SOUL'S BED AGAIN AND SUE DID NOT EVEN SUSPECT SHE WAS THERE AFTER GAZING A WHILE AT THE PALACE PICTURE DURING WHICH HER AMBITIOUS PRIDE ROSE AND ROSE
4598-6176-0018 SHE TURNED YET AGAIN IN CONDESCENDING MOOD AND HONORED THE HOME PICTURE WITH ONE STARE MORE WHAT A POOR MISERABLE SPOT IT IS COMPARED WITH THIS LORDLY PALACE SHE SAID
4598-6176-0019 BUT PRESENTLY SHE SPIED SOMETHING IN IT SHE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE AND DREW NEARER IT WAS THE FORM OF A LITTLE GIRL BUILDING A BRIDGE OF STONES OVER ONE OF THE HILL BROOKS AH THERE I AM MYSELF SHE SAID
4598-6176-0020 THAT IS JUST HOW I USED TO DO NO SHE RESUMED IT IS NOT ME THAT SNUB NOSED LITTLE FRIGHT COULD NEVER BE MEANT FOR ME IT WAS THE FROCK THAT MADE ME THINK SO
4598-6176-0021 I DECLARE I CAN SEE THE SMOKE OF THE COTTAGE RISING FROM BEHIND THE HILL WHAT A DULL DIRTY INSIGNIFICANT SPOT IT IS AND WHAT A LIFE TO LEAD THERE SHE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE CITY PICTURE
4598-6176-0022 AND NOW A STRANGE THING TOOK PLACE IN PROPORTION AS THE OTHER TO THE EYES OF HER MIND RECEDED INTO THE BACKGROUND THIS TO HER PRESENT BODILY EYES APPEARED TO COME FORWARD AND ASSUME REALITY
4598-6176-0023 SHE GAVE A CRY OF CONVICTION AND SAID ALOUD I DO BELIEVE IT IS REAL THAT FRAME IS ONLY A TRICK OF THE WOMAN TO MAKE ME FANCY IT A PICTURE LEST I SHOULD GO AND MAKE MY FORTUNE SHE IS A WITCH THE UGLY OLD CREATURE
4598-6176-0024 AND HAVE HER PUNISHED FOR NOT TAKING ME TO THE PALACE ONE OF HIS POOR LOST CHILDREN HE IS SO FOND OF I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER UGLY OLD HEAD CUT OFF ANYHOW I WILL TRY MY LUCK WITHOUT ASKING HER LEAVE
4598-6176-0025 HOW SHE HAS ILL USED ME BUT AT THAT MOMENT SHE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE WISE WOMAN CALLING AGNES AND SMOOTHING HER FACE SHE TRIED TO LOOK AS GOOD AS SHE COULD AND WALKED BACK INTO THE COTTAGE
4598-6176-0026 THERE STOOD THE WISE WOMAN LOOKING ALL ROUND THE PLACE AND EXAMINING HER WORK SHE FIXED HER EYES UPON AGNES IN A WAY THAT CONFUSED HER AND MADE HER CAST HERS DOWN FOR SHE FELT AS IF SHE WERE READING HER THOUGHTS
4598-6176-0027 THE WISE WOMAN HOWEVER ASKED NO QUESTIONS BUT BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HER WORK APPROVING OF SOME OF IT WHICH FILLED HER WITH ARROGANCE AND SHOWING HOW SOME OF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER WHICH FILLED HER WITH RESENTMENT
4598-6176-0028 BUT THE WISE WOMAN SEEMED TO TAKE NO CARE OF WHAT SHE MIGHT BE THINKING AND WENT STRAIGHT ON WITH HER LESSON BY THE TIME IT WAS OVER THE POWER OF READING THOUGHTS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS IN THE MIND OF AGNES
4598-6176-0029 THAT IS UP INTO HER FACE WHICH IS THE SURFACE OF THE MIND ERE IT HAD TIME TO SINK DOWN AGAIN THE WISE WOMAN CAUGHT UP THE LITTLE MIRROR AND HELD IT BEFORE HER AGNES SAW HER SOMEBODY
4598-6176-0030 THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF MISERABLE CONCEIT AND UGLY ILL TEMPER SHE GAVE SUCH A SCREAM OF HORROR THAT THE WISE WOMAN PITIED HER AND LAYING ASIDE THE MIRROR TOOK HER UPON HER KNEES AND TALKED TO HER MOST KINDLY AND SOLEMNLY
4598-6176-0031 IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF DESTROYING THE UGLY THINGS THAT COME OUT OF THE HEART SO UGLY THAT THEY MAKE THE VERY FACE OVER THEM UGLY ALSO AND WHAT WAS AGNES DOING ALL THE TIME THE WISE WOMAN WAS TALKING TO HER
4598-6176-0032 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT INSTEAD OF THINKING HOW TO KILL THE UGLY THINGS IN HER HEART SHE WAS WITH ALL HER MIGHT RESOLVING TO BE MORE CAREFUL OF HER FACE THAT IS TO KEEP DOWN THE THINGS IN HER HEART SO THAT THEY SHOULD NOT SHOW IN HER FACE
4598-6176-0033 SHE WAS RESOLVING TO BE A HYPOCRITE AS WELL AS A SELF WORSHIPPER HER HEART WAS WORMY AND THE WORMS WERE EATING VERY FAST AT IT NOW THEN THE WISE WOMAN LAID HER GENTLY DOWN UPON THE HEATHER BED AND SHE FELL FAST ASLEEP
4598-6176-0034 AND HAD AN AWFUL DREAM ABOUT HER SOMEBODY WHEN SHE WOKE IN THE MORNING INSTEAD OF GETTING UP TO DO THE WORK OF THE HOUSE SHE LAY THINKING TO EVIL PURPOSE IN PLACE OF TAKING HER DREAM AS A WARNING
4598-6176-0035 AND THINKING OVER WHAT THE WISE WOMAN HAD SAID THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE COMMUNED WITH HERSELF IN THIS FASHION
4598-6176-0036 THE OLD WITCH SHOWS ME HORRIBLE THINGS IN THE DAY TO SET ME DREAMING HORRIBLE THINGS IN THE NIGHT IF I DON'T RUN AWAY THAT FRIGHTFUL BLUE PRISON AND THE DISGUSTING GIRL WILL COME BACK AND I SHALL GO OUT OF MY MIND
4598-6176-0037 I SHALL GO AND LOOK AT THE PICTURE AGAIN IF IT BE A PICTURE AS SOON AS I'VE GOT MY CLOTHES ON THE WORK CAN WAIT IT'S NOT MY WORK IT'S THE OLD WITCH'S AND SHE OUGHT TO DO IT HERSELF
4598-6176-0038 SHE JUMPED OUT OF BED AND HURRIED ON HER CLOTHES THERE WAS NO WISE WOMAN TO BE SEEN AND SHE HASTENED INTO THE HALL THERE WAS THE PICTURE WITH THE MARBLE PALACE AND THE PROCLAMATION SHINING IN LETTERS OF GOLD
4598-6176-0039 UPON ITS GATES OF BRASS SHE STOOD BEFORE IT AND GAZED AND GAZED AND ALL THE TIME IT KEPT GROWING UPON HER IN SOME STRANGE WAY UNTIL AT LAST SHE WAS FULLY PERSUADED THAT IT WAS NO PICTURE BUT A REAL CITY
4598-6176-0040 SQUARE AND MARBLE PALACE SEEN THROUGH A FRAMED OPENING IN THE WALL SHE RAN UP TO THE FRAME STEPPED OVER IT FELT THE WIND BLOW UPON HER CHEEK
4598-6176-0041 FREE WAS SHE WITH THAT CREATURE INSIDE HER THE SAME MOMENT A TERRIBLE STORM OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING WIND AND RAIN CAME ON THE UPROAR WAS APPALLING AGNES THREW HERSELF UPON THE GROUND
4598-6176-0042 HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND THERE LAY UNTIL IT WAS OVER AS SOON AS SHE FELT THE SUN SHINING ON HER SHE ROSE THERE WAS THE CITY FAR AWAY ON THE HORIZON WITHOUT ONCE TURNING TO TAKE A FAREWELL LOOK
4598-6176-0043 OF THE PLACE SHE WAS LEAVING SHE SET OFF AS FAST AS HER FEET WOULD CARRY HER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY SO EAGER WAS SHE THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE FELL
