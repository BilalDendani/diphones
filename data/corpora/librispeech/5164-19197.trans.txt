5164-19197-0000 THE ATTACK WAS A HURRICANE ON THE EVENING BEFORE IN THE DARKNESS THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN APPROACHED SILENTLY AS BY A BOA NOW IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN THAT WIDENING STREET SURPRISE WAS DECIDEDLY IMPOSSIBLE
5164-19197-0001 RUDE FORCE HAD MOREOVER BEEN UNMASKED THE CANNON HAD BEGUN THE ROAR THE ARMY HURLED ITSELF ON THE BARRICADE FURY NOW BECAME SKILL A POWERFUL DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY OF THE LINE
5164-19197-0002 BROKEN AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE NATIONAL GUARD AND THE MUNICIPAL GUARD ON FOOT AND SUPPORTED BY SERRIED MASSES WHICH COULD BE HEARD THOUGH NOT SEEN
5164-19197-0003 WITH DRUMS BEATING TRUMPETS BRAYING BAYONETS LEVELLED THE SAPPERS AT THEIR HEAD AND IMPERTURBABLE UNDER THE PROJECTILES CHARGED STRAIGHT FOR THE BARRICADE WITH THE WEIGHT OF A BRAZEN BEAM AGAINST A WALL THE WALL HELD FIRM
5164-19197-0004 THE INSURGENTS FIRED IMPETUOUSLY THE BARRICADE ONCE SCALED HAD A MANE OF LIGHTNING FLASHES THE ASSAULT WAS SO FURIOUS THAT FOR ONE MOMENT IT WAS INUNDATED WITH ASSAILANTS
5164-19197-0005 BUT IT SHOOK OFF THE SOLDIERS AS THE LION SHAKES OFF THE DOGS AND IT WAS ONLY COVERED WITH BESIEGERS AS THE CLIFF IS COVERED WITH FOAM TO RE APPEAR A MOMENT LATER BEETLING BLACK AND FORMIDABLE
5164-19197-0006 THE COLUMN FORCED TO RETREAT REMAINED MASSED IN THE STREET UNPROTECTED BUT TERRIBLE AND REPLIED TO THE REDOUBT WITH A TERRIBLE DISCHARGE OF MUSKETRY ANY ONE WHO HAS SEEN FIREWORKS
5164-19197-0007 WILL RECALL THE SHEAF FORMED OF INTERLACING LIGHTNINGS WHICH IS CALLED A BOUQUET LET THE READER PICTURE TO HIMSELF THIS BOUQUET NO LONGER VERTICAL BUT HORIZONTAL BEARING A BULLET BUCK SHOT
5164-19197-0008 FROM ITS CLUSTERS OF LIGHTNING THE BARRICADE WAS UNDERNEATH IT ON BOTH SIDES THE RESOLUTION WAS EQUAL THE BRAVERY EXHIBITED THERE WAS ALMOST BARBAROUS AND WAS COMPLICATED WITH A SORT OF HEROIC FEROCITY
5164-19197-0009 WHICH BEGAN BY THE SACRIFICE OF SELF THIS WAS THE EPOCH WHEN A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN FOUGHT LIKE A ZOUAVE THE TROOP WISHED TO MAKE AN END OF IT INSURRECTION WAS DESIROUS OF FIGHTING

5164-19197-0013 THERE IS NO MORE VIOLENT PRODIGAL THAN THE AVARICIOUS MAN WHO TAKES THE BIT IN HIS TEETH THERE IS NO MAN MORE TERRIBLE IN ACTION THAN A DREAMER MARIUS WAS FORMIDABLE AND PENSIVE IN BATTLE HE WAS AS IN A DREAM
5164-19197-0014 ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HIM A PHANTOM ENGAGED IN FIRING A GUN THE INSURGENTS CARTRIDGES WERE GIVING OUT BUT NOT THEIR SARCASMS IN THIS WHIRLWIND OF THE SEPULCHRE IN WHICH THEY STOOD THEY LAUGHED

5164-19197-0023 IT IS NECESSARY TO IMAGINE FIRE SET TO A THRONG OF TERRIBLE COURAGES AND THEN TO GAZE AT THE CONFLAGRATION IT WAS NOT A COMBAT IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF A FURNACE THERE MOUTHS BREATHED THE FLAME
5164-19197-0024 THERE COUNTENANCES WERE EXTRAORDINARY THE HUMAN FORM SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THERE THE COMBATANTS FLAMED FORTH THERE
