8664-175359-0000 WHICH THEY ATTACKED ALL THE MORE GREEDILY ARRIVING AS THEY DID WHEN THE ANIMALS WERE PERISHING WITH HUNGER FROM THE LONG WINTER THEY HAD TORN OPEN THE COVERING OF THE SLEDGE WITH THEIR ENORMOUS PAWS THE CASES OF PEMMICAN WERE OPEN AND HALF EMPTY
8664-175359-0001 THE BISCUIT BAGS PILLAGED THE PROVISIONS OF TEA SPILT OVER THE SNOW A BARREL OF SPIRITS OF WINE BROKEN UP AND ITS PRECIOUS CONTENTS RUN OUT THE CAMPING MATERIALS LYING ALL ABOUT
8664-175359-0002 THE WILD ANIMALS HAD DONE THEIR WORK THE DEVILS HAVE DONE FOR US SAID BELL WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW SAID SIMPSON LET US FIRST SEE HOW MUCH WE'VE LOST SAID THE DOCTOR WE CAN TALK AFTER HATTERAS SAID NOTHING
8664-175359-0003 BUT BEGAN PICKING UP THE SCATTERED OBJECTS THEY PICKED UP ALL THE PEMMICAN AND BISCUIT THAT WAS STILL EATABLE THE LOSS OF SO MUCH SPIRITS OF WINE WAS DEPLORABLE AS WITHOUT IT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANY HOT DRINKS NO TEA NOR COFFEE
8664-175359-0004 THE DOCTOR MADE AN INVENTORY OF THE PROVISIONS THAT WERE LEFT AND FOUND THAT THE ANIMALS HAD EATEN TWO HUNDRED POUNDS OF PEMMICAN AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OF BISCUIT IF THE TRAVELLERS CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY
8664-175359-0005 THEY WOULD BE OBLIGED TO PUT THEMSELVES ON HALF RATIONS THEY DELIBERATED ABOUT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
8664-175359-0006 BUT HOW COULD THEY RESOLVE TO LOSE THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES ALREADY CLEARED AND COMING BACK WITHOUT THE FUEL HOW WOULD THEY BE RECEIVED BY THE CREW AND WHICH OF THEM WOULD BEGIN THE EXCURSION AGAIN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WAS TO GO ON
8664-175359-0007 EVEN AT THE PRICE OF THE WORST PRIVATIONS THE DOCTOR HATTERAS AND BELL WERE FOR GOING ON BUT SIMPSON WANTED TO GO BACK HIS HEALTH HAD SEVERELY SUFFERED FROM THE FATIGUES OF THE JOURNEY AND HE GREW VISIBLY WEAKER
8664-175359-0008 BUT AT LAST SEEING HE WAS ALONE IN HIS OPINION HE TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE SLEDGE AND THE LITTLE CARAVAN CONTINUED ITS ROUTE DURING THE THREE FOLLOWING DAYS FROM THE FIFTEENTH TO THE SEVENTEENTH OF JANUARY
8664-175359-0009 THE MONOTONOUS INCIDENTS OF THE JOURNEY TOOK PLACE AGAIN THEY WENT ON MORE SLOWLY THE TRAVELLERS WERE SOON TIRED THEIR LEGS ACHED WITH FATIGUE AND THE DOGS DREW WITH DIFFICULTY THEIR INSUFFICIENT FOOD TOLD UPON THEM
8664-175359-0010 THE WEATHER CHANGED WITH ITS USUAL QUICKNESS GOING SUDDENLY FROM INTENSE COLD TO DAMP AND PENETRATING FOGS ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF JANUARY THE ASPECT OF THE ICE FIELD CHANGED ALL AT ONCE A GREAT NUMBER OF PEAKS LIKE PYRAMIDS
8664-175359-0011 ENDING IN A SHARP POINT AT A GREAT ELEVATION SHOWED THEMSELVES ON THE HORIZON THE SOIL IN CERTAIN PLACES WAS SEEN THROUGH THE LAYER OF SNOW IT SEEMED TO CONSIST OF SCHIST AND QUARTZ WITH SOME APPEARANCE OF CALCAREOUS ROCK
8664-175359-0012 AT LAST THE TRAVELLERS HAD REACHED TERRA FIRMA AND ACCORDING TO THEIR ESTIMATION THE CONTINENT MUST BE NEW CORNWALL THE DOCTOR WAS DELIGHTED TO TREAD ON SOLID GROUND ONCE MORE THE TRAVELLERS HAD ONLY A HUNDRED MORE MILES TO GO BEFORE REACHING BELCHER CAPE
8664-175359-0013 BUT THE TROUBLE OF WALKING INCREASED ON THIS ROCKY SOIL FULL OF INEQUALITIES CREVICES AND PRECIPICES THEY WERE OBLIGED TO PLUNGE INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE LAND AND CLIMB THE HIGH CLIFFS ON THE COAST ACROSS NARROW GORGES
8664-175359-0014 IN WHICH THE SNOW WAS PILED UP TO A HEIGHT OF THIRTY OR FORTY FEET THE TRAVELLERS SOON HAD CAUSE TO REGRET THE LEVELS THEY HAD LEFT ON WHICH THE SLEDGE ROLLED SO EASILY NOW THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DRAG IT WITH ALL THEIR STRENGTH
8664-175359-0015 THE DOGS WERE WORN OUT AND HAD TO BE HELPED THE MEN HARNESSED THEMSELVES ALONG WITH THEM AND WORE THEMSELVES OUT TOO THEY WERE OFTEN OBLIGED TO UNLOAD THE PROVISIONS IN ORDER TO GET OVER A STEEP HILL WHOSE FROZEN SURFACE GAVE NO HOLD
8664-175359-0016 SOME PASSAGES TEN FEET LONG TOOK HOURS TO CLEAR DURING THE FIRST DAY THEY ONLY MADE ABOUT FIVE MILES ON THAT LAND SO WELL NAMED CORNWALL THE NEXT DAY THE SLEDGE ATTAINED THE UPPER PART OF THE CLIFFS
8664-175359-0017 THE TRAVELLERS WERE TOO EXHAUSTED TO CONSTRUCT THEIR SNOW HOUSE AND WERE OBLIGED TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER THE TENT ENVELOPED IN THEIR BUFFALO SKINS AND DRYING THEIR STOCKINGS BY PLACING THEM ON THEIR CHESTS
8664-175359-0018 THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A STATE OF THINGS MAY BE READILY IMAGINED DURING THE NIGHT THE THERMOMETER WENT DOWN TO FORTY FOUR DEGREES BELOW ZERO AND THE MERCURY FROZE THE HEALTH OF SIMPSON BECAME ALARMING
8664-175359-0019 AN OBSTINATE COLD VIOLENT RHEUMATISM AND INTOLERABLE PAIN FORCED HIM TO LIE DOWN ON THE SLEDGE WHICH HE COULD NO LONGER GUIDE BELL TOOK HIS PLACE HE WAS NOT WELL BUT WAS OBLIGED NOT TO GIVE IN
8664-175359-0020 THE DOCTOR ALSO FELT THE INFLUENCE OF HIS TERRIBLE WINTER EXCURSION BUT HE DID NOT UTTER A COMPLAINT HE MARCHED ON IN FRONT LEANING ON HIS STICK HE LIGHTED THE WAY HE HELPED IN EVERYTHING
8664-175359-0021 HATTERAS IMPASSIVE IMPENETRABLE INSENSIBLE IN AS GOOD HEALTH AS THE FIRST DAY WITH HIS IRON CONSTITUTION FOLLOWED THE SLEDGE IN SILENCE ON THE TWENTIETH OF JANUARY THE WEATHER WAS SO BAD
8664-175359-0022 THAT THE LEAST EFFORT CAUSED IMMEDIATE PROSTRATION BUT THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE GROUND BECAME SO GREAT THAT HATTERAS AND BELL HARNESSED THEMSELVES ALONG WITH THE DOGS THE FRONT OF THE SLEDGE WAS BROKEN BY AN UNEXPECTED SHOCK
8664-175359-0023 AND THEY WERE FORCED TO STOP AND MEND IT SUCH DELAYS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES A DAY THE TRAVELLERS WERE JOURNEYING ALONG A DEEP RAVINE UP TO THEIR WAISTS IN SNOW AND PERSPIRING NOTWITHSTANDING THE VIOLENT COLD NO ONE SPOKE
8664-175359-0024 ALL AT ONCE BELL LOOKED AT THE DOCTOR IN ALARM PICKED UP A HANDFUL OF SNOW AND BEGAN TO RUB HIS COMPANION'S FACE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT WHAT THE DEUCE BELL SAID THE DOCTOR STRUGGLING BUT BELL WENT ON RUBBING ARE YOU

8664-175359-0028 A VIOLENT ATTACK OF SCURVY HIS LEGS SWELL ALREADY AND HIS GUMS ARE ATTACKED THE POOR FELLOW IS LYING UNDER HIS BLANKETS ON THE SLEDGE AND EVERY SHOCK INCREASES HIS PAIN
8664-175359-0029 I PITY HIM BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR HIM POOR SIMPSON SAID BELL PERHAPS WE HAD BETTER STOP A DAY OR TWO SAID THE DOCTOR STOP CRIED HATTERAS WHEN THE LIVES OF EIGHTEEN MEN DEPEND UPON OUR RETURN
8664-175359-0030 YOU KNOW WE HAVE ONLY ENOUGH PROVISIONS LEFT FOR TWENTY DAYS NEITHER THE DOCTOR NOR BELL COULD ANSWER THAT AND THE SLEDGE WENT ON ITS WAY IN THE EVENING THEY STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF AN ICE HILL
8664-175359-0031 OUT OF WHICH BELL SOON CUT A CAVERN THE TRAVELLERS TOOK REFUGE IN IT AND THE DOCTOR PASSED THE NIGHT IN NURSING SIMPSON HE WAS A PREY TO THE SCURVY AND CONSTANT GROANS ISSUED FROM HIS TERRIFIED LIPS
8664-175359-0032 I SHALL NEVER GET OVER IT I WISH I WAS DEAD ALREADY TAKE COURAGE MY POOR FELLOW ANSWERED THE DOCTOR WITH PITY IN HIS TONE AND HE ANSWERED SIMPSON'S COMPLAINTS BY INCESSANT ATTENTION
8664-175359-0033 THOUGH HALF DEAD WITH FATIGUE HE EMPLOYED A PART OF THE NIGHT IN MAKING THE SICK MAN A SOOTHING DRAUGHT AND RUBBED HIM WITH LIME JUICE UNFORTUNATELY IT HAD LITTLE EFFECT AND DID NOT PREVENT THE TERRIBLE MALADY SPREADING
8664-175359-0034 THE NEXT DAY THEY WERE OBLIGED TO LIFT THE POOR FELLOW ON TO THE SLEDGE ALTHOUGH HE BEGGED AND PRAYED THEM TO LEAVE HIM TO DIE IN PEACE AND BEGIN THEIR PAINFUL MARCH AGAIN THE FREEZING MISTS WET THE THREE MEN TO THE SKIN
8664-175359-0035 THE SNOW AND SLEET BEAT IN THEIR FACES THEY DID THE WORK OF BEASTS OF BURDEN AND HAD NOT EVEN SUFFICIENT FOOD DICK RAN HITHER AND THITHER DISCOVERING BY INSTINCT THE BEST ROUTE TO FOLLOW
8664-175359-0036 DURING THE MORNING OF THE TWENTY THIRD OF JANUARY WHEN IT WAS NEARLY DARK FOR THE NEW MOON HAD NOT YET MADE HER APPEARANCE DICK RAN ON FIRST HE WAS LOST TO SIGHT FOR SEVERAL HOURS HATTERAS BECAME ANXIOUS AS THERE WERE MANY BEAR MARKS ON THE GROUND
8664-175359-0037 HE WAS CONSIDERING WHAT HAD BETTER BE DONE WHEN A LOUD BARKING WAS HEARD IN FRONT THE LITTLE PROCESSION MOVED ON QUICKER AND SOON CAME UPON THE FAITHFUL ANIMAL IN THE DEPTH OF A RAVINE DICK WAS SET AS IF HE HAD BEEN PETRIFIED IN FRONT OF A SORT OF CAIRN
8664-175359-0038 MADE OF LIMESTONE AND COVERED WITH A CEMENT OF ICE THIS TIME SAID THE DOCTOR DISENGAGING HIMSELF FROM THE TRACES IT'S REALLY A CAIRN WE CAN'T BE MISTAKEN WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO US SAID HATTERAS WHY
8664-175359-0039 IF IT IS A CAIRN IT MAY INCLOSE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE USEFUL TO US SOME PROVISIONS PERHAPS AS IF EUROPEANS HAD EVER BEEN HERE SAID HATTERAS SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
8664-175359-0040 BUT IF NOT EUROPEANS IT MAY BE THAT THE ESQUIMAUX HAVE HIDDEN SOME PRODUCT OF THEIR HUNTING HERE THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO DOING IT I THINK WELL LOOK IF YOU LIKE CLAWBONNY BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS WORTH YOUR WHILE
8664-175359-0041 CLAWBONNY AND BELL ARMED WITH THEIR PICKAXES MADE FOR THE CAIRN DICK KEPT ON BARKING FURIOUSLY THE CAIRN WAS SOON DEMOLISHED AND THE DOCTOR TOOK OUT A DAMP PAPER HATTERAS TOOK THE DOCUMENT AND READ
