4273-188161-0000 CHAPTER FIVE MY FATHER MEETS SOME TIGERS
4273-188161-0001 AND THE JUNGLE WAS VERY GLOOMY AND DENSE THE TREES GREW CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND WHAT ROOM THERE WAS BETWEEN THEM WAS TAKEN UP BY GREAT HIGH FERNS WITH STICKY LEAVES
4273-188161-0002 HE ATE THREE TANGERINES MAKING SURE TO KEEP ALL THE PEELS THIS TIME AND PUT ON HIS RUBBER BOOTS MY FATHER TRIED TO FOLLOW THE RIVER BANK BUT IT WAS VERY SWAMPY
4273-188161-0003 AND AS HE WENT FARTHER THE SWAMP BECAME DEEPER WHEN IT WAS ALMOST AS DEEP AS HIS BOOT TOPS HE GOT STUCK IN THE OOZY MUCKY MUD
4273-188161-0004 HERE THE JUNGLE WAS SO THICK THAT HE COULD HARDLY SEE WHERE THE RIVER WAS HE UNPACKED HIS COMPASS AND FIGURED OUT THE DIRECTION HE SHOULD WALK IN ORDER TO STAY NEAR THE RIVER
4273-188161-0005 HE WAS GETTING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE RIVER IT WAS VERY HARD TO WALK IN THE JUNGLE
4273-188161-0006 AND HE KEPT TRIPPING OVER ROOTS AND ROTTEN LOGS
4273-188161-0007 HE BEGAN TO HEAR WHISPERY NOISES BUT HE COULDN'T SEE ANY ANIMALS ANYWHERE THE DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE HE WENT THE SURER HE WAS THAT SOMETHING WAS FOLLOWING HIM
4273-188161-0008 AND THE NOISES ONLY CAME NEARER ONCE OR TWICE HE THOUGHT HE HEARD SOMETHING LAUGHING AT HIM AT LAST HE CAME OUT INTO A CLEARING AND RAN RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF IT SO THAT HE COULD SEE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT TRY TO ATTACK HIM
4273-188161-0009 WHEN HE LOOKED AND SAW FOURTEEN GREEN EYES COMING OUT OF THE JUNGLE ALL AROUND THE CLEARING AND WHEN THE GREEN EYES TURNED INTO SEVEN TIGERS THE TIGERS WALKED AROUND HIM IN A BIG CIRCLE
4273-188161-0010 SAID THE THIRD TIGER MY FATHER THOUGHT OF THE CAT AND KNEW THIS WASN'T TRUE BUT OF COURSE HE HAD TOO MUCH SENSE TO SAY SO ONE DOESN'T CONTRADICT A HUNGRY TIGER
4273-188161-0011 HE QUICKLY OPENED HIS KNAPSACK AND TOOK OUT THE CHEWING GUM THE CAT HAD TOLD HIM THAT TIGERS WERE ESPECIALLY FOND OF CHEWING GUM WHICH WAS VERY SCARCE ON THE ISLAND SO HE THREW THEM EACH A PIECE BUT THEY ONLY GROWLED AS FOND AS WE ARE OF
4273-188161-0012 CHEWING GUM WE'RE SURE WE'D LIKE YOU EVEN BETTER
4273-188161-0013 BUT THIS IS VERY SPECIAL CHEWING GUM SAID MY FATHER IF YOU KEEP ON CHEWING IT LONG ENOUGH IT WILL TURN GREEN AND THEN IF YOU PLANT IT IT WILL GROW MORE CHEWING GUM AND THE SOONER YOU START CHEWING THE SOONER YOU'LL HAVE MORE THE TIGERS SAID
4273-188161-0014 AS EACH ONE WANTED TO BE THE FIRST TO PLANT THE CHEWING GUM THEY ALL UNWRAPPED THEIR PIECES AND BEGAN CHEWING AS HARD AS THEY COULD EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ONE TIGER WOULD LOOK INTO ANOTHER'S MOUTH AND SAY NOPE IT'S NOT DONE YET
