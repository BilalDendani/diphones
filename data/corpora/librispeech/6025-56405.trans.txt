6025-56405-0000 YEARS AGO I ATTENDED AT SOME INCONVENIENCE A LARGE PUBLIC MEETING BECAUSE I HEARD THAT LUCRETIA MOTT WAS TO SPEAK AFTER SEVERAL ADDRESSES A SLIGHT LADY WITH WHITE CAP AND DRAB QUAKER DRESS CAME FORWARD THOUGH WELL IN YEARS
6025-56405-0001 HER EYES WERE BRIGHT HER SMILE WAS WINSOME
6025-56405-0002 AND THE MANNER HAD SUCH NATURALNESS AND GRACE AS A QUEEN MIGHT ENVY I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE WORDS FORGOTTEN EVEN THE SUBJECT BUT THE BENIGN PRESENCE AND GRACIOUS SMILE I SHALL NEVER FORGET
6025-56405-0003 HER FATHER THOMAS COFFIN WAS A SEA CAPTAIN OF STAUNCH PRINCIPLE HER MOTHER A WOMAN OF GREAT ENERGY WIT AND GOOD SENSE THE CHILDREN'S PLEASURES WERE SUCH AS A PLAIN COUNTRY HOME AFFORDED WHEN MISSUS COFFIN WENT TO VISIT HER NEIGHBORS SHE WOULD SAY TO HER DAUGHTERS
6025-56405-0004 NOW AFTER YOU HAVE FINISHED KNITTING TWENTY BOUTS
6025-56405-0005 WHEN LUCRETIA WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD THE FAMILY MOVED TO BOSTON AT FIRST ALL THE CHILDREN ATTENDED A PRIVATE SCHOOL BUT CAPTAIN COFFIN FEARING THIS WOULD MAKE THEM PROUD
6025-56405-0006 YEARS AFTER LUCRETIA SAID
6025-56405-0007 WHICH BUT FOR THIS EXPERIENCE I MIGHT NEVER HAVE KNOWN A YEAR LATER SHE WAS SENT TO A FRIENDS BOARDING SCHOOL AT NINE PARTNERS NEW YORK BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS ATTENDED THIS SCHOOL BUT WERE NOT PERMITTED TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER UNLESS THEY WERE NEAR RELATIVES IF SO
6025-56405-0008 THEY COULD TALK A LITTLE ON CERTAIN DAYS OVER A CERTAIN CORNER OF THE FENCE BETWEEN THE PLAYGROUNDS
6025-56405-0009 SUCH GRAVE PRECAUTIONS DID NOT ENTIRELY PREVENT THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR WHEN A LAD WAS SHUT UP IN A CLOSET ON BREAD AND WATER LUCRETIA AND HER SISTER SUPPLIED HIM WITH BREAD AND BUTTER UNDER THE DOOR THIS BOY WAS A COUSIN OF THE TEACHER JAMES MOTT
6025-56405-0010 WHO WAS FOND OF THE QUICK WITTED SCHOOL GIRL SO THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT NO HARM CAME TO HER FROM BREAKING THE RULES AT FIFTEEN LUCRETIA WAS APPOINTED AN ASSISTANT TEACHER AND SHE AND MISTER MOTT WITH A DESIRE TO KNOW MORE OF LITERATURE
6025-56405-0011 AND QUITE POSSIBLY MORE OF EACH OTHER BEGAN TO STUDY FRENCH TOGETHER HE WAS TALL WITH LIGHT HAIR AND BLUE EYES AND SHY IN MANNER SHE PETITE WITH DARK HAIR AND EYES QUICK IN THOUGHT AND ACTION AND FOND OF MIRTH
6025-56405-0012 WHEN SHE WAS EIGHTEEN AND JAMES TWENTY ONE THE YOUNG TEACHERS WERE MARRIED AND BOTH WENT TO HER FATHER'S HOME IN PHILADELPHIA TO RESIDE HE ASSISTING IN MISTER COFFIN'S BUSINESS
6025-56405-0013 THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE BROUGHT FINANCIAL FAILURE TO MANY AND YOUNG MOTT SOON FOUND HIMSELF WITH A WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER TO SUPPORT AND NO WORK HOPING THAT HE COULD OBTAIN A SITUATION WITH AN UNCLE IN NEW YORK STATE HE TOOK HIS FAMILY THITHER
6025-56405-0014 BUT CAME BACK DISAPPOINTED FINALLY HE FOUND WORK IN A PLOW STORE AT A SALARY OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR CAPTAIN COFFIN MEANTIME HAD DIED LEAVING HIS FAMILY POOR JAMES COULD DO SO LITTLE FOR THEM ALL WITH HIS LIMITED SALARY
6025-56405-0015 THAT HE DETERMINED TO OPEN A SMALL STORE BUT THE EXPERIMENT PROVED A FAILURE HIS HEALTH BEGAN TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS ILL SUCCESS WHEN LUCRETIA WITH HER BRAVE HEART SAID MY COUSIN AND I WILL OPEN A SCHOOL THEE MUST NOT GET DISCOURAGED JAMES
6025-56405-0016 THE SCHOOL WAS OPENED WITH FOUR PUPILS EACH PAYING SEVEN DOLLARS A QUARTER THE YOUNG WIFE PUT SO MUCH GOOD CHEER AND EARNESTNESS INTO HER WORK THAT SOON THERE WERE FORTY PUPILS IN THE SCHOOL MISTER MOTT'S PROSPECTS NOW BRIGHTENED FOR HE WAS EARNING ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
6025-56405-0017 THE YOUNG COUPLE WERE HAPPY IN THEIR HARD WORK FOR THEY LOVED EACH OTHER AND LOVE LIGHTENS ALL CARE AND LABOR BUT SOON A SORROW WORSE THAN POVERTY CAME THEIR ONLY SON THOMAS A MOST AFFECTIONATE CHILD
6025-56405-0018 DIED SAYING WITH HIS LATEST BREATH I LOVE THEE MOTHER IT WAS A CRUSHING BLOW BUT IT PROVED A BLESSING IN THE END LEADING HER THOUGHTS HEAVENWARD A FEW MONTHS AFTERWARDS HER VOICE WAS HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PUBLIC IN PRAYER IN ONE OF THE FRIENDS MEETINGS
6025-56405-0019 THE WORDS WERE SIMPLE EARNEST ELOQUENT THE GOOD QUAKERS MARVELLED AND ENCOURAGED THE GIFT THEY DID NOT ASK WHETHER MAN OR WOMAN BROUGHT THE MESSAGE SO IT CAME FROM HEAVEN AND NOW AT TWENTY FIVE HAVING RESIGNED HER POSITION AS TEACHER
6025-56405-0020 SHE BEGAN CLOSE STUDY OF THE BIBLE AND THEOLOGICAL BOOKS SHE HAD FOUR CHILDREN TO CARE FOR DID ALL HER SEWING EVEN CUTTING AND MAKING HER OWN DRESSES BUT SHE LEARNED WHAT EVERY ONE CAN LEARN TO ECONOMIZE TIME HER HOUSE WAS KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN
6025-56405-0021 SHE SAYS I OMITTED MUCH UNNECESSARY STITCHING AND ORNAMENTAL WORK IN THE SEWING FOR MY FAMILY SO THAT I MIGHT HAVE MORE TIME FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF MY MIND
6025-56405-0022 FOR NOVELS AND LIGHT READING I NEVER HAD MUCH TASTE THE LADIES DEPARTMENT IN THE PERIODICALS OF THE DAY HAD NO ATTRACTION FOR ME SHE WOULD LAY A COPY OF WILLIAM PENN'S PONDEROUS VOLUMES OPEN AT THE FOOT OF HER BED
6025-56405-0023 AND DRAWING HER CHAIR CLOSE TO IT WITH HER BABY ON HER LAP WOULD STUDY THE BOOK DILIGENTLY A WOMAN OF LESS ENERGY AND LESS WILL POWER THAN YOUNG MISSUS MOTT WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF BEING A SCHOLAR SHE READ THE BEST BOOKS IN PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE
6025-56405-0024 JOHN STUART MILL AND DEAN STANLEY THOUGH WIDELY DIFFERENT WERE AMONG HER FAVORITE AUTHORS JAMES MOTT WAS NOW PROSPERING IN THE COTTON BUSINESS SO THAT THEY COULD SPARE TIME TO GO IN THEIR CARRIAGE AND SPEAK AT THE QUAKER MEETINGS IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
6025-56405-0025 LUCRETIA WOULD BE SO ABSORBED IN THOUGHT AS NOT TO NOTICE THE BEAUTIES OF THE LANDSCAPE WHICH HER HUSBAND ALWAYS GREATLY ENJOYED POINTING OUT A FINE VIEW TO HER SHE REPLIED YES IT IS BEAUTIFUL NOW THAT THOU POINTS IT OUT
6025-56405-0026 FROM A CHILD SHE WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED FOR THE SLAVE SHE HAD READ IN HER SCHOOL BOOKS CLARKSON'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SLAVE SHIPS AND THESE LEFT AN IMPRESSION NEVER TO BE EFFACED
6025-56405-0027 WHEN DECEMBER FOURTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE A CONVENTION MET IN PHILADELPHIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING THE AMERICAN ANTI SLAVERY SOCIETY LUCRETIA MOTT WAS ONE OF THE FOUR WOMEN WHO BRAVED THE SOCIAL OBLOQUY AS FRIENDS OF THE DESPISED ABOLITIONISTS

6025-56405-0029 SO UNHEARD OF A THING WAS AN ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN AND SO UNACCUSTOMED WERE THEY TO THE METHODS OF ORGANIZATION THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO CALL A COLORED MAN TO THE CHAIR TO ASSIST THEM THE YEARS OF MARTYRDOM WHICH FOLLOWED WE AT THIS DAY CAN SCARCELY REALIZE
6025-56405-0030 ANTI SLAVERY LECTURERS WERE TARRED AND FEATHERED MOBS IN NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA SWARMED THE STREETS BURNING HOUSES AND BREAKING CHURCH WINDOWS IN THE LATTER CITY THEY SURROUNDED THE HALL OF THE ABOLITIONISTS WHERE THE WOMEN WERE HOLDING A LARGE CONVENTION

6025-56405-0032 THE CALM WOMAN SENT HER LITTLE CHILDREN AWAY AND THEN IN THE PARLOR WITH A FEW FRIENDS PEACEFULLY AWAITED A PROBABLE DEATH IN THE TURBULENT THRONG WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO WHILE HE WAS NO FRIEND OF THE COLORED MAN COULD NOT SEE LUCRETIA MOTT HARMED
6025-56405-0033 WITH SKILFUL RUSE AS THEY NEARED THE HOUSE HE RUSHED UP ANOTHER STREET SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE ON TO MOTTS AND THE WILD CROWD BLINDLY FOLLOWED WREAKING THEIR VENGEANCE IN ANOTHER QUARTER A YEAR LATER IN DELAWARE WHERE MISSUS MOTT WAS SPEAKING
6025-56405-0034 ONE OF HER PARTY A DEFENCELESS OLD MAN WAS DRAGGED FROM THE HOUSE AND TARRED AND FEATHERED SHE FOLLOWED BEGGING THE MEN TO DESIST AND SAYING THAT SHE WAS THE REAL OFFENDER BUT NO VIOLENT HANDS WERE LAID UPON HER AT ANOTHER TIME
6025-56405-0035 WHEN THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ANTI SLAVERY SOCIETY IN NEW YORK WAS BROKEN UP BY THE MOB SOME OF THE SPEAKERS WERE ROUGHLY HANDLED PERCEIVING THAT SEVERAL LADIES WERE TIMID MISSUS MOTT SAID TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING HER WON'T THEE LOOK AFTER SOME OF THE OTHERS
6025-56405-0036 BUT WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU HE SAID WITH GREAT TACT AND A SWEET SMILE SHE ANSWERED THIS MAN LAYING HER HAND ON THE ARM OF ONE OF THE ROUGHEST OF THE MOB
6025-56405-0037 THE ASTONISHED MAN HAD LIKE OTHERS A TENDER HEART BENEATH THE ROUGHNESS AND WITH RESPECTFUL MANNER TOOK HER TO A PLACE OF SAFETY THE NEXT DAY GOING INTO A RESTAURANT SHE SAW THE LEADER OF THE MOB AND IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN BY HIM AND BEGAN TO CONVERSE
6025-56405-0038 HER KINDNESS AND HER SWEET VOICE LEFT A DEEP IMPRESSION AS HE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM HE ASKED AT THE DOOR WHO IS THAT LADY WHY THAT IS LUCRETIA MOTT FOR A SECOND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED BUT HE ADDED WELL SHE'S A GOOD SENSIBLE WOMAN
