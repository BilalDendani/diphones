8012-273145-0000 IT'S TIME ANNE WAS IN TO DO HER SEWING SAID MARILLA GLANCING AT THE CLOCK AND THEN OUT INTO THE YELLOW AUGUST AFTERNOON WHERE EVERYTHING DROWSED IN THE HEAT
8012-273145-0001 AND NOW SHE'S PERCHED OUT THERE ON THE WOODPILE TALKING TO MATTHEW NINETEEN TO THE DOZEN WHEN SHE KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL SHE OUGHT TO BE AT HER WORK AND OF COURSE HE'S LISTENING TO HER LIKE A PERFECT NINNY I NEVER SAW SUCH AN INFATUATED MAN
8012-273145-0002 THE MORE HE'S DELIGHTED EVIDENTLY ANNE SHIRLEY YOU COME RIGHT IN HERE THIS MINUTE DO YOU HEAR ME A SERIES OF STACCATO TAPS ON THE WEST WINDOW BROUGHT ANNE FLYING IN FROM THE YARD EYES SHINING CHEEKS FAINTLY FLUSHED WITH PINK
8012-273145-0003 UNBRAIDED HAIR STREAMING BEHIND HER IN A TORRENT OF BRIGHTNESS OH MARILLA SHE EXCLAIMED BREATHLESSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A SUNDAY SCHOOL PICNIC NEXT WEEK
8012-273145-0004 AND MISSUS SUPERINTENDENT BELL AND MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE ARE GOING TO MAKE ICE CREAM THINK OF IT MARILLA ICE CREAM AND OH MARILLA CAN I GO TO IT JUST LOOK AT THE CLOCK IF YOU PLEASE ANNE
8012-273145-0005 WHAT TIME DID I TELL YOU TO COME IN TWO O'CLOCK BUT ISN'T IT SPLENDID ABOUT THE PICNIC MARILLA PLEASE CAN I GO
8012-273145-0006 I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T OBEY ME ANNE WHY I MEANT TO MARILLA AS MUCH AS COULD BE BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW FASCINATING IDLEWILD IS AND THEN OF COURSE I HAD TO TELL MATTHEW ABOUT THE PICNIC
8012-273145-0007 MATTHEW IS SUCH A SYMPATHETIC LISTENER PLEASE CAN I GO YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN TO RESIST THE FASCINATION OF IDLE WHATEVER YOU CALL IT WHEN I TELL YOU TO COME IN AT A CERTAIN TIME
8012-273145-0008 AND YOU NEEDN'T STOP TO DISCOURSE WITH SYMPATHETIC LISTENERS ON YOUR WAY EITHER AS FOR THE PICNIC OF COURSE YOU CAN GO YOU'RE A SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHOLAR AND IT'S NOT LIKELY I'D REFUSE TO LET YOU GO WHEN ALL THE OTHER LITTLE GIRLS ARE GOING
8012-273145-0009 BUT FALTERED ANNE DIANA SAYS THAT EVERYBODY MUST TAKE A BASKET OF THINGS TO EAT I CAN'T COOK AS YOU KNOW MARILLA AND AND
8012-273145-0010 I DON'T MIND GOING TO A PICNIC WITHOUT PUFFED SLEEVES SO MUCH BUT I'D FEEL TERRIBLY HUMILIATED IF I HAD TO GO WITHOUT A BASKET IT'S BEEN PREYING ON MY MIND EVER SINCE DIANA TOLD ME WELL IT NEEDN'T PREY ANY LONGER I'LL BAKE YOU A BASKET
8012-273145-0011 GETTING THROUGH WITH HER OHS ANNE CAST HERSELF INTO MARILLA'S ARMS AND RAPTUROUSLY KISSED HER SALLOW CHEEK IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HER WHOLE LIFE THAT CHILDISH LIPS HAD VOLUNTARILY TOUCHED MARILLA'S FACE
8012-273145-0012 AGAIN THAT SUDDEN SENSATION OF STARTLING SWEETNESS THRILLED HER SHE WAS SECRETLY VASTLY PLEASED AT ANNE'S IMPULSIVE CARESS WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY SHE SAID BRUSQUELY THERE THERE NEVER MIND YOUR KISSING NONSENSE
8012-273145-0013 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DOING STRICTLY AS YOU'RE TOLD AS FOR COOKING I MEAN TO BEGIN GIVING YOU LESSONS IN THAT SOME OF THESE DAYS BUT YOU'RE SO FEATHERBRAINED ANNE
8012-273145-0014 AND LEARN TO BE STEADY BEFORE I BEGIN YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU IN COOKING AND NOT STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS TO LET YOUR THOUGHTS ROVE ALL OVER CREATION NOW GET OUT YOUR PATCHWORK AND HAVE YOUR SQUARE DONE BEFORE TEATIME
8012-273145-0015 I DO NOT LIKE PATCHWORK SAID ANNE DOLEFULLY
8012-273145-0016 IT'S JUST ONE LITTLE SEAM AFTER ANOTHER AND YOU NEVER SEEM TO BE GETTING ANYWHERE
8012-273145-0017 I HAVE TO FURNISH MOST OF THE IMAGINATION BUT I'M WELL ABLE TO DO THAT DIANA IS SIMPLY PERFECT IN EVERY OTHER WAY
8012-273145-0018 I ASSURE YOU IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO THINK IT OUT I STAYED AWAKE NEARLY A WHOLE NIGHT BEFORE I INVENTED IT THEN JUST AS I WAS DROPPING OFF TO SLEEP IT CAME LIKE AN INSPIRATION DIANA WAS ENRAPTURED WHEN SHE HEARD IT
8012-273145-0019 WE HAVE GOT OUR HOUSE FIXED UP ELEGANTLY YOU MUST COME AND SEE IT MARILLA WON'T YOU WE HAVE GREAT BIG STONES
8012-273145-0020 OF COURSE THEY'RE ALL BROKEN BUT IT'S THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE WHOLE THERE'S A PIECE OF A PLATE WITH A SPRAY OF RED AND YELLOW IVY ON IT THAT IS ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL WE KEEP IT IN THE PARLOR AND WE HAVE THE FAIRY GLASS THERE TOO
8012-273145-0021 THE FAIRY GLASS IS AS LOVELY AS A DREAM DIANA FOUND IT OUT IN THE WOODS BEHIND THEIR CHICKEN HOUSE IT'S ALL FULL OF RAINBOWS JUST LITTLE YOUNG RAINBOWS THAT HAVEN'T GROWN BIG YET AND DIANA'S MOTHER TOLD HER IT WAS BROKEN OFF A HANGING LAMP THEY ONCE HAD
8012-273145-0022 BUT IT'S NICE TO IMAGINE THE FAIRIES LOST IT ONE NIGHT WHEN THEY HAD A BALL SO WE CALL IT THE FAIRY GLASS MATTHEW IS GOING TO MAKE US A TABLE OH WE HAVE NAMED THAT LITTLE ROUND POOL OVER IN MISTER BARRY'S FIELD WILLOWMERE
8012-273145-0023 I GOT THAT NAME OUT OF THE BOOK DIANA LENT ME THAT WAS A THRILLING BOOK MARILLA THE HEROINE HAD FIVE LOVERS I'D BE SATISFIED WITH ONE WOULDN'T YOU SHE WAS VERY HANDSOME AND SHE
8012-273145-0024 BUT I'M REALLY VERY HEALTHY FOR ALL I'M SO THIN I BELIEVE I'M GETTING FATTER THOUGH DON'T YOU THINK I AM I LOOK AT MY ELBOWS EVERY MORNING WHEN I GET UP TO SEE IF ANY DIMPLES ARE COMING DIANA IS HAVING
8012-273145-0025 A NEW DRESS MADE WITH ELBOW SLEEVES SHE IS GOING TO WEAR IT TO THE PICNIC
8012-273145-0026 I SUPPOSE I'D LIVE THROUGH IT BUT I'M CERTAIN IT WOULD BE A LIFELONG SORROW
8012-273145-0027 THEY WOULDN'T MAKE UP FOR MISSING THIS ONE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE BOATS ON THE LAKE OF SHINING WATERS AND ICE CREAM AS I TOLD YOU I HAVE NEVER TASTED ICE CREAM DIANA TRIED TO EXPLAIN
8012-273145-0028 WHAT IT WAS LIKE BUT I GUESS ICE CREAM IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND IMAGINATION ANNE YOU HAVE TALKED EVEN ON FOR TEN MINUTES BY THE CLOCK SAID MARILLA
8012-273145-0029 ANNE HELD HER TONGUE AS DESIRED BUT FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK SHE TALKED PICNIC AND THOUGHT PICNIC AND DREAMED PICNIC ON SATURDAY IT RAINED AND SHE WORKED HERSELF UP INTO SUCH A FRANTIC STATE LEST IT SHOULD KEEP ON RAINING UNTIL AND OVER WEDNESDAY
8012-273145-0030 THAT MARILLA MADE HER SEW AN EXTRA PATCHWORK SQUARE BY WAY OF STEADYING HER NERVES ON SUNDAY ANNE CONFIDED TO MARILLA ON THE WAY HOME FROM CHURCH
8012-273145-0031 I COULDN'T HELP FEARING I'D ONLY IMAGINED IT BUT WHEN A MINISTER SAYS A THING IN THE PULPIT YOU JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE IT
8012-273145-0032 OH MARILLA LOOKING FORWARD TO THINGS IS HALF THE PLEASURE OF THEM EXCLAIMED ANNE YOU MAYN'T GET THE THINGS THEMSELVES BUT NOTHING CAN PREVENT YOU FROM HAVING THE FUN OF LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM MISSUS LYNDE SAYS
8012-273145-0033 BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE WORSE TO EXPECT NOTHING THAN TO BE DISAPPOINTED MARILLA WORE HER AMETHYST BROOCH TO CHURCH THAT DAY AS USUAL MARILLA ALWAYS WORE HER AMETHYST BROOCH TO CHURCH
8012-273145-0034 SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT RATHER SACRILEGIOUS TO LEAVE IT OFF AS BAD AS FORGETTING HER BIBLE OR HER COLLECTION DIME THAT AMETHYST BROOCH WAS MARILLA'S MOST TREASURED POSSESSION A SEAFARING UNCLE HAD GIVEN IT TO HER
8012-273145-0035 MOTHER WHO IN TURN HAD BEQUEATHED IT TO MARILLA IT WAS AN OLD FASHIONED OVAL CONTAINING A BRAID OF HER MOTHER'S HAIR SURROUNDED BY A BORDER OF VERY FINE AMETHYSTS
