2397-162253-0000 THE STEWARD SHOUTED FROM THE HOSPITAL PORCH THAT EAGLE WING THE PRISONER PATIENT HAD ESCAPED THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW DESPITE ITS HEIGHT ABOVE THE SLOPING GROUND A LITTLE LADDER BORROWED FROM THE QUARTERMASTER'S CORRAL WAS FOUND A MOMENT LATER
2397-162253-0001 AN INDIAN PONY SADDLED SIOUX FASHION WAS CAUGHT RUNNING RIDERLESS TOWARD THE TRADER'S BACK GATE HIS HORSEHAIR BRIDLE TORN HALF WAY FROM HIS SHAGGY HEAD
2397-162253-0002 NO SOONER HEARD THAT MOREAU WAS GONE THAN HE RUSHED HIS STABLE GUARD TO THE SADDLEROOM AND IN FIFTEEN MINUTES HAD NOT ONLY HIS OWN SQUAD BUT HALF A DOZEN CASUAL TROOPERS CIRCLING THE POST IN SEARCH OF THE TRAIL
2397-162253-0003 POST ORDNANCE QUARTERMASTER AND COMMISSARY SERGEANTS MANY OF THE POST GUARD AND MOST OF THE POST LAUNDRESSES HAD GATHERED SOME SILENT ANXIOUS AND BEWILDERED SOME EXCITEDLY BABBLING
2397-162253-0004 ESTHER DADE VERY PALE AND SOMEWHAT OUT OF BREATH WAS TRYING WITH QUIET SELF POSSESSION TO ANSWER THE MYRIAD QUESTIONS POURED AT HER WHILE DOCTOR WALLER WAS MINISTERING TO THE DAZED AND MOANING SENTRY
2397-162253-0005 THE CLOAK AND SKIRTS OF CIVILIZATION HAD BEEN FOUND BENEATH THE WINDOW OF THE DESERTED ROOM AND WERE EXHIBITED AS A MEANS OF BRINGING TO HIS SENSES
2397-162253-0006 AND TO AN IMPULSIVE REPLY FROM THE LIPS OF MISSUS HAY
2397-162253-0007 THEN RISING AND STEPPING ASIDE THE LONG SUFFERING WOMAN REVEALED THE PALLID SENSELESS FACE
2397-162253-0008 NANETTE LA FLEUR A LONG LOST SISTER'S ONLY CHILD
2397-162253-0009 HE HAD UNEARTHED AN ALMOST FORGOTTEN LEGEND OF OLD FORT LARAMIE
2397-162253-0010 THE DISCOVERY OF THE LADDER AND OF THE ESCAPE OF THE PRISONER FOR WHOM HE WAS ACCOUNTABLE HAD FILLED HIM WITH DISMAY YET FOR THE MOMENT FAILED TO STAGGER HIS INDOMITABLE SELF ESTEEM
2397-162253-0011 SHE WAS THE GENERAL'S PROTEGEE NOT HIS AND THE GENERAL MUST SHOULDER THE BLAME EVEN WHEN FLINT SAW NANETTE SELF CONVICTED THROUGH HER VERY GARB AND HER PRESENCE AT THE SCENE OF THE FINAL STRUGGLE EVEN WHEN ASSURED IT WAS SHE AND NOT THE LITTLE
2397-162253-0012 ALL THIS WOULD BE ENDANGERED BY HIS ATTEMPT TO REJOIN THE WARRIORS ON THE WARPATH THE MAJOR ORDERED THE INSTANT ARREST OF THE SENTRY STATIONED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM SHUT OUT BY THE MAJOR'S OWN ACT FROM ALL POSSIBILITY OF SEEING WHAT WAS GOING ON WITHIN
2397-162253-0013 DEMANDED OF DOCTOR WALLER THAT HE SAY IN SO MANY WORDS THAT THE GAG AND WRIST THONGS ON THE PROSTRATE SENTRY HAD NOT BEEN SELF APPLIED WALLER IMPASSIVELY POINTED TO THE HUGE LUMP AT THE BASE OF THE SUFFERER'S SKULL
2397-162253-0014 BUT THESE HAD REALIZED THEIR UNPOPULARITY AFTER THE BATTLE ON THE ELK AND HAD DEPARTED FOR OTHER CLIMES CRAPAUD WAS STILL UNDER GUARD
2397-162253-0015 AND FOLLOWED CLOSE BY A MOCCASINED MAN
2397-162253-0016 AND THE MOCCASINED FEET OF A MAN AND WOMAN HAD SCURRIED DOWN THE BLUFF FROM THE HOSPITAL WINDOW TO MEET THEM WEST OF FOSTER'S SHANTY THEN THERE HAD BEEN CONFUSION TROUBLE OF SOME KIND ONE PONY PURSUED A SHORT DISTANCE HAD BROKEN AWAY
2397-162253-0017 THE OTHERS HAD GONE POUNDING OUT SOUTHEASTWARD UP THE SLOPE AND OUT OVER THE UPLANDS THEN DOWN AGAIN IN WIDE SWEEP THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE LITTLE RIVULET
2397-162253-0018 AND ALONG THE LOW BENCH SOUTHWEST OF THE FORT CROSSING THE ROCK SPRINGS ROAD AND STRIKING FURTHER ON DIAGONALLY THE RAWLINS TRAIL WHERE CRABB AND HIS FELLOWS HAD FOUND IT AND FOLLOWED
2397-162253-0019 FOR AT LAST IT WAS FOUND THROUGH THE THICK AND LUSTROUS HAIR THAT SHE TOO HAD BEEN STRUCK A HARSH AND CRUEL BLOW
2397-162253-0020 THAT ONE REASON PROBABLY WHY SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO OPPOSE NO STOUTER RESISTANCE TO SO SLENDER A GIRL AS ESTHER DADE WAS THAT SHE WAS ALREADY HALF DAZED THROUGH THE STROKE OF SOME BLUNT HEAVY WEAPON WIELDED PROBABLY BY HIM SHE WAS RISKING ALL TO SAVE
2397-162253-0021 MEANTIME THE MAJOR HAD BEEN PURSUING HIS INVESTIGATIONS SCHMIDT THE SOLDIER SENTRY IN FRONT OF MOREAU'S DOOR A SIMPLE HEARTED TEUTON OF IRREPROACHABLE CHARACTER TEARFULLY PROTESTED AGAINST HIS INCARCERATION
2397-162253-0022 TO PRESUME TO REOPEN IT THE MAJOR SAID TO THE LADY HE WOULD RETURN FOR HER SOON AFTER TEN AND THE LADY SMILINGLY SCHMIDT DID NOT SAY HOW SMILINGLY HOW BEWITCHINGLY SMILINGLY
2397-162253-0023 AND ALL THAT TIME THE DOOR WAS OPEN THE PRISONER ON THE BED IN HIS BLANKETS THE LAMP BRIGHTLY BURNING IT WAS NEAR TATTOO WHEN SHE RETURNED
2397-162253-0024 WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT SHE CAME THE SAME CLOAK AROUND HER YET SHE LOOKED DIFFERENT SOMEHOW AND MUST HAVE TIPTOED
2397-162253-0025 SHE DIDN'T SEEM QUITE SO TALL EITHER AND THAT WAS ALL FOR HE NEVER KNEW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT TILL THE STEWARD CAME RUNNING TO TELL OF THE ESCAPE SO SCHMIDT COULD THROW BUT LITTLE LIGHT UPON THE SITUATION SAVE TO FLINT HIMSELF
2397-162253-0026 A LADY CAME FROM THE SOUTH OF THE BUILDING AS THOUGH SHE WERE GOING DOWN TO SUDSTOWN MISSUS FOSTER HAD GONE DOWN NOT LONG BEFORE AND HOGAN WITH A LANTERN AND TWO OFFICERS LADIES BUT THIS ONE CAME ALL ALONE AND SPOKE TO HIM PLEASANT LIKE
2397-162253-0027 AND SAID SHE WAS SO SORRY HE COULDN'T BE AT THE DANCE SHE'D BEEN SEEING THE SICK AND WOUNDED IN HOSPITAL SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO BRING SOME WINE AND JELLIES
2397-162253-0028 THEN SHE LAUGHED AND SAID GOOD NIGHT AND WENT ON TO THE HOSPITAL WHAT BECAME OF THE WINE SHE HAD POURED OUT THIS FROM THE GRIM AND HITHERTO SILENT DOCTOR SEATED BY THE BEDSIDE SHE MUST HAVE TOSSED IT OUT OR DRUNK IT HERSELF PERHAPS SIX DIDN'T KNOW
2397-162253-0029 CERTAINLY NO TRACE OF IT COULD BE FOUND IN THE SNOW THEN NOTHING HAPPENED FOR AS MUCH AS TWENTY MINUTES OR SO AND HE WAS OVER TOWARD THE SOUTH END OF HIS POST BUT FACING TOWARD THE HOSPITAL WHEN SHE CAME AGAIN DOWN THE STEPS
2397-162253-0030 AND STARS AND BOMBS AND THAT WAS ALL HE KNEW TILL THEY BEGAN TALKING TO HIM HERE IN HOSPITAL SOMETHING HAD HIT HIM FROM BEHIND BUT HE COULDN'T TELL WHAT FLINT'S NERVE WAS FAILING HIM FOR HERE WAS CONFIRMATION OF THE GENERAL'S THEORY
2397-162253-0031 AND TWAS THE LATTER THAT BADE THE MAJOR SUMMON THE GIRL AND DEMAND OF HER
2397-162253-0032 OR A GOOD IMITATION OF ONE AS ON TWO OCCASIONS THE MAID HAD PEEKED AND SEEN HER DOWN STAIRS AT THE BACK DOOR IN THE DEAD HOURS OF THE NIGHT OR THE VERY EARLY MORNING THAT WAS WHEN SHE FIRST CAME THEN SINCE THE RECAPTURE MISS MC GRATH FELT CONFIDENT
2397-162253-0033 THE BOYS DO BE ALL TALKIN ABOUT THE NIGHT IN FACT THAT STABBER'S BAND SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE PLATTE RAY'S TROOP FOLLOWING AT DAWN
2397-162253-0034 MISS MC GRATH HADN'T BEEN SPYING OF COURSE BECAUSE HER ROOM WAS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE BEYOND THE KITCHEN BUT HOW DID THE LITTLE HEEL TRACKS GET ON THE VERANDA ROOF THE ROAD DUST ON THE MATTING UNDER THE WINDOW THE VINE TWIGS IN THAT QUARE MADE SKIRT NEVER WORN BY DAY
2397-162253-0035 EVERYBODY AT FRAYNE WELL KNEW BY THIS TIME THAT SHE HAD SO RIDDEN AT FORT FRAYNE WAS KNOWN TO NO OFFICER OR LADY OF THE GARRISON THEN PRESENT BUT BELIEVED BY MISS MC GRATH BECAUSE OF CERTAIN INEXPRESSIBLES
2397-162253-0036 THE MORNING CAPTAIN BLAKE WAS HAVING HIS CHASE AFTER THE INDIANS
2397-162253-0037 ALL THIS AND MORE DID MISS MC GRATH REVEAL BEFORE BEING PERMITTED TO RETURN TO THE SANCTITY OF HER CHAMBER AND FLINT FELT THE GROUND SINKING BENEATH HIS FEET
2397-162253-0038 THIS INDIAN LEADER OF WHOM EXAMPLE PROMPT AND SHARP WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN MADE UNLESS THE GENERAL AND THE ENDS OF JUSTICE WERE DEFEATED BUT WHAT STUNG THE MAJOR MOST OF ALL WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN FAIRLY VICTIMIZED HOODWINKED
2397-162253-0039 THAT THE MAJOR SOUGHT HER ON THE MORROW
2397-162253-0040 AND THAT THOUGH HE WOULD NOT PLACE THE TRADER'S NIECE WITHIN A GARRISON CELL HE SHOULD HOLD HER PRISONER BENEATH THE TRADER'S ROOF TO AWAIT THE ACTION OF SUPERIOR AUTHORITY ON THE GRIEVOUS CHARGES LODGED AT HER DOOR SHE WAS ABLE TO BE UP SAID MISS MC GRATH
2397-162253-0041 NOT ONLY UP BUT DOWN DOWN IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM LOOKING BLITHER AND MORE LIKE HERSELF THAN SHE HAD BEEN SINCE SHE WAS BROUGHT HOME
2397-162253-0042 COLD STERN AND ACCUSING THE OTHER LOOKED SQUARELY AT HIM WITH FEARLESS GLITTERING EYES
2397-162253-0043 AND THAT YOU WILL NEVER LAY HANDS ON HIM AGAIN THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE IN ERROR MISS FLOWER WAS THE MAJOR'S CALM COLD BLOODED YET REJOICEFUL REPLY IT WAS FOR THIS INDEED THAT HE HAD COME
