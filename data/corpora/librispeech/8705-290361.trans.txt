8705-290361-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE OF OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES THE MIND BEING AS I HAVE DECLARED FURNISHED WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF THE SIMPLE IDEAS CONVEYED IN BY THE SENSES AS THEY ARE FOUND IN EXTERIOR THINGS
8705-290361-0001 OR BY REFLECTION ON ITS OWN OPERATIONS TAKES NOTICE ALSO THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THESE SIMPLE IDEAS GO CONSTANTLY TOGETHER WHICH BEING PRESUMED TO BELONG TO ONE THING AND WORDS BEING SUITED TO COMMON APPREHENSIONS
8705-290361-0002 AND MADE USE OF FOR QUICK DISPATCH ARE CALLED SO UNITED IN ONE SUBJECT BY ONE NAME WHICH BY INADVERTENCY WE ARE APT AFTERWARD TO TALK OF AND CONSIDER AS ONE SIMPLE IDEA WHICH INDEED IS A COMPLICATION OF MANY IDEAS TOGETHER
8705-290361-0003 BECAUSE AS I HAVE SAID NOT IMAGINING HOW THESE SIMPLE IDEAS CAN SUBSIST BY THEMSELVES WE ACCUSTOM OURSELVES TO SUPPOSE SOME SUBSTRATUM WHEREIN THEY DO SUBSIST AND FROM WHICH THEY DO RESULT WHICH THEREFORE
8705-290361-0004 WE CALL SUBSTANCE TWO OUR OBSCURE IDEA OF SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL SO THAT IF ANY ONE WILL EXAMINE HIMSELF CONCERNING HIS NOTION OF PURE SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL
8705-290361-0005 HE WOULD NOT BE IN A MUCH BETTER CASE THAN THE INDIAN BEFORE MENTIONED WHO SAYING THAT THE WORLD WAS SUPPORTED BY A GREAT ELEPHANT WAS ASKED WHAT THE ELEPHANT RESTED ON TO WHICH HIS ANSWER WAS A GREAT TORTOISE BUT BEING AGAIN PRESSED TO KNOW
8705-290361-0006 WHAT GAVE SUPPORT TO THE BROAD BACKED TORTOISE REPLIED SOMETHING HE KNEW NOT WHAT AND THUS HERE AS IN ALL OTHER CASES WHERE WE USE WORDS WITHOUT HAVING CLEAR AND DISTINCT IDEAS WE TALK LIKE CHILDREN WHO
8705-290361-0007 THAT IT IS SOMETHING WHICH IN TRUTH SIGNIFIES NO MORE WHEN SO USED EITHER BY CHILDREN OR MEN BUT THAT THEY KNOW NOT WHAT AND THAT THE THING THEY PRETEND TO KNOW AND TALK OF IS WHAT THEY HAVE NO DISTINCT IDEA OF AT ALL
8705-290361-0008 WHICH ACCORDING TO THE TRUE IMPORT OF THE WORD IS IN PLAIN ENGLISH STANDING UNDER OR UPHOLDING THREE OF THE SORTS OF SUBSTANCES AN OBSCURE AND RELATIVE IDEA OF SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL
8705-290361-0009 AND ARE THEREFORE SUPPOSED TO FLOW FROM THE PARTICULAR INTERNAL CONSTITUTION OR UNKNOWN ESSENCE OF THAT SUBSTANCE THUS WE COME TO HAVE THE IDEAS OF A MAN HORSE GOLD
8705-290361-0010 FURTHER THAN OF CERTAIN SIMPLE IDEAS CO EXISTENT TOGETHER I APPEAL TO EVERY ONE'S OWN EXPERIENCE IT IS THE ORDINARY QUALITIES OBSERVABLE IN IRON OR A DIAMOND PUT TOGETHER THAT MAKE THE TRUE
8705-290361-0011 COMPLEX IDEA OF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH A SMITH
8705-290361-0012 WHO WHATEVER SUBSTANTIAL FORMS HE MAY TALK OF HAS NO OTHER IDEA OF THOSE SUBSTANCES THAN WHAT IS FRAMED BY A COLLECTION OF THOSE SIMPLE IDEAS WHICH ARE TO BE FOUND IN THEM ONLY WE MUST TAKE NOTICE THAT OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES
8705-290361-0013 BESIDES ALL THOSE SIMPLE IDEAS THEY ARE MADE UP OF HAVE ALWAYS THE CONFUSED IDEA OF SOMETHING TO WHICH THEY BELONG AND IN WHICH THEY SUBSIST AND THEREFORE WHEN WE SPEAK OF ANY SORT OF SUBSTANCE WE SAY IT IS A THING HAVING SUCH OR SUCH QUALITIES
8705-290361-0014 AS BODY IS A THING THAT IS EXTENDED FIGURED AND CAPABLE OF MOTION SPIRIT A THING CAPABLE OF THINKING AND SO HARDNESS FRIABILITY AND POWER TO DRAW IRON WE SAY ARE QUALITIES TO BE FOUND IN A LOADSTONE
8705-290361-0015 THESE AND THE LIKE FASHIONS OF SPEAKING INTIMATE THAT THE SUBSTANCE IS SUPPOSED ALWAYS SOMETHING BESIDES THE EXTENSION FIGURE SOLIDITY MOTION THINKING OR OTHER OBSERVABLE IDEAS
8705-290361-0016 THOUGH WE KNOW NOT WHAT IT IS FOUR NO CLEAR OR DISTINCT IDEA OF SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL HENCE WHEN WE TALK OR THINK OF ANY PARTICULAR SORT OF CORPOREAL SUBSTANCES
8705-290361-0017 THOUGH THE IDEA WE HAVE OF EITHER OF THEM BE BUT THE COMPLICATION OR COLLECTION OF THOSE SEVERAL SIMPLE IDEAS OF SENSIBLE QUALITIES WHICH WE USED TO FIND UNITED IN THE THING CALLED HORSE OR STONE YET BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW THEY SHOULD SUBSIST ALONE
8705-290361-0018 THOSE MANY SENSIBLE QUALITIES WHICH AFFECT OUR SENSES DO SUBSIST BY SUPPOSING A SUBSTANCE WHEREIN THINKING KNOWING DOUBTING
8705-290361-0019 WE HAVE AS CLEAR A NOTION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF SPIRIT AS WE HAVE OF BODY THE ONE BEING SUPPOSED TO BE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IT IS THE SUBSTRATUM TO THOSE SIMPLE IDEAS WE HAVE FROM WITHOUT AND THE OTHER SUPPOSED WITH A LIKE IGNORANCE OF WHAT IT IS
8705-290361-0020 AND THEREFORE FROM OUR NOT HAVING ANY NOTION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF SPIRIT WE CAN NO MORE CONCLUDE ITS NON EXISTENCE THAN WE CAN FOR THE SAME REASON DENY THE EXISTENCE OF BODY
8705-290361-0021 OUR IDEAS OF PARTICULAR SORTS OF SUBSTANCES WHATEVER THEREFORE BE THE SECRET ABSTRACT NATURE OF SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL ALL THE IDEAS WE HAVE OF PARTICULAR DISTINCT SORTS OF SUBSTANCES ARE NOTHING BUT SEVERAL COMBINATIONS OF SIMPLE IDEAS
8705-290361-0022 CO EXISTING IN SUCH THOUGH UNKNOWN CAUSE OF THEIR UNION AS MAKES THE WHOLE SUBSIST OF ITSELF IT IS BY SUCH COMBINATIONS OF SIMPLE IDEAS AND NOTHING ELSE THAT WE REPRESENT PARTICULAR SORTS OF SUBSTANCES TO OURSELVES
8705-290361-0023 UPON HEARING WHICH WORDS EVERY ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE LANGUAGE FRAMES IN HIS MIND A COMBINATION OF THOSE SEVERAL SIMPLE IDEAS WHICH HE HAS USUALLY OBSERVED OR FANCIED TO EXIST TOGETHER UNDER THAT DENOMINATION
8705-290361-0024 IT BE MANIFEST AND EVERY ONE UPON INQUIRY INTO HIS OWN THOUGHTS WILL FIND THAT HE HAS NO OTHER IDEA OF ANY SUBSTANCE
8705-290361-0025 VITRIOL BREAD BUT WHAT HE HAS BARELY OF THOSE SENSIBLE QUALITIES WHICH HE SUPPOSES TO INHERE
8705-290361-0026 A SUPPORT TO THOSE QUALITIES OR SIMPLE IDEAS WHICH HE HAS OBSERVED TO EXIST UNITED TOGETHER THUS THE IDEA OF THE SUN WHAT IS IT BUT AN AGGREGATE OF THOSE SEVERAL SIMPLE IDEAS BRIGHT HOT ROUNDISH
8705-290361-0027 SEVEN THEIR ACTIVE AND PASSIVE POWERS A GREAT PART OF OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES FOR HE HAS THE PERFECTEST IDEA OF ANY OF THE PARTICULAR SORTS OF SUBSTANCES WHO HAS GATHERED AND PUT TOGETHER
8705-290361-0028 MOST OF THOSE SIMPLE IDEAS WHICH DO EXIST IN IT AMONG WHICH ARE TO BE RECKONED ITS ACTIVE POWERS AND PASSIVE CAPACITIES WHICH THOUGH NOT SIMPLE IDEAS YET IN THIS RESPECT FOR BREVITY'S SAKE MAY CONVENIENTLY ENOUGH BE RECKONED AMONGST THEM
8705-290361-0029 THUS THE POWER OF DRAWING IRON IS ONE OF THE IDEAS OF THE COMPLEX ONE OF THAT SUBSTANCE WE CALL A LOADSTONE AND A POWER TO BE SO DRAWN IS A PART OF THE COMPLEX ONE WE CALL IRON WHICH POWERS PASS FOR INHERENT QUALITIES IN THOSE SUBJECTS
8705-290361-0030 BECAUSE EVERY SUBSTANCE BEING AS APT BY THE POWERS WE OBSERVE IN IT TO CHANGE SOME SENSIBLE QUALITIES IN OTHER SUBJECTS AS IT IS TO PRODUCE IN US THOSE SIMPLE IDEAS WHICH WE RECEIVE IMMEDIATELY FROM IT DOES BY THOSE NEW SENSIBLE QUALITIES
8705-290361-0031 INTRODUCED INTO OTHER SUBJECTS DISCOVER TO US THOSE POWERS WHICH DO THEREBY MEDIATELY AFFECT OUR SENSES AS REGULARLY AS ITS SENSIBLE QUALITIES DO IT IMMEDIATELY
8705-290361-0032 NOTHING BUT POWERS IN IT TO PRODUCE THOSE IDEAS IN US
