1564-142299-0000 FREDERICK REVENGE MAY HAVE HER OWN ROUSED DISCIPLINE ALOUD PROCLAIMS THEIR CAUSE
1564-142299-0001 BYRON MARGARET BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER ALL OFFERS WERE AS UNEXPECTED BEFOREHAND AS DISTRESSING AT THE TIME OF THEIR OCCURRENCE AS THE TWO SHE HAD HAD
1564-142299-0002 AN INVOLUNTARY COMPARISON BETWEEN MISTER LENNOX AND MISTER THORNTON AROSE IN HER MIND SHE HAD BEEN SORRY THAT AN EXPRESSION OF ANY OTHER FEELING THAN FRIENDSHIP HAD BEEN LURED OUT BY CIRCUMSTANCES FROM HENRY LENNOX
1564-142299-0003 THAT REGRET WAS THE PREDOMINANT FEELING ON THE FIRST OCCASION OF HER RECEIVING A PROPOSAL
1564-142299-0004 SO IMPRESSED AS SHE DID NOW WHEN ECHOES OF MISTER THORNTON'S VOICE YET LINGERED ABOUT THE ROOM IN LENNOX'S CASE HE SEEMED FOR A MOMENT TO HAVE SLID OVER THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE
1564-142299-0005 AND THE INSTANT AFTERWARDS TO REGRET IT NEARLY AS MUCH AS SHE DID ALTHOUGH FOR DIFFERENT REASONS IN MISTER THORNTON'S CASE AS FAR AS MARGARET KNEW THERE WAS NO INTERVENING STAGE OF FRIENDSHIP
1564-142299-0006 THEIR INTERCOURSE HAD BEEN ONE CONTINUED SERIES OF OPPOSITION THEIR OPINIONS CLASHED AND INDEED SHE HAD NEVER PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD CARED FOR HER OPINIONS AS BELONGING TO HER THE INDIVIDUAL
1564-142299-0007 AS FAR AS THEY DEFIED HIS ROCK LIKE POWER OF CHARACTER HIS PASSION STRENGTH HE SEEMED TO THROW THEM OFF FROM HIM WITH CONTEMPT UNTIL SHE FELT THE WEARINESS OF THE EXERTION OF MAKING USELESS PROTESTS
1564-142299-0008 AND NOW HE HAD COME IN THIS STRANGE WILD PASSIONATE WAY TO MAKE KNOWN HIS LOVE FOR ALTHOUGH AT FIRST IT HAD STRUCK HER THAT HIS OFFER WAS FORCED AND GOADED OUT OF HIM BY SHARP COMPASSION
1564-142299-0009 FOR THE EXPOSURE SHE HAD MADE OF HERSELF WHICH HE LIKE OTHERS MIGHT MISUNDERSTAND YET
1564-142299-0010 AND CERTAINLY NOT FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE CLEAR CONVICTION DAWNED UPON HER SHINED BRIGHT UPON HER THAT HE DID LOVE HER THAT HE HAD LOVED HER THAT HE WOULD LOVE HER
1564-142299-0011 AND SHE SHRANK AND SHUDDERED AS UNDER THE FASCINATION OF SOME GREAT POWER REPUGNANT TO HER WHOLE PREVIOUS LIFE SHE CREPT AWAY AND HID FROM HIS IDEA BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
1564-142299-0012 TO PARODY A LINE OUT OF FAIRFAX'S TASSO HIS STRONG IDEA WANDERED THROUGH HER THOUGHT SHE DISLIKED HIM THE MORE FOR HAVING MASTERED HER INNER WILL
1564-142299-0013 HOW DARED HE SAY THAT HE WOULD LOVE HER STILL EVEN THOUGH SHE SHOOK HIM OFF WITH CONTEMPT SHE WISHED SHE HAD SPOKEN MORE STRONGER SHARP DECISIVE SPEECHES CAME THRONGING INTO HER MIND
1564-142299-0014 NOW THAT IT WAS TOO LATE TO UTTER THEM THE DEEP IMPRESSION MADE BY THE INTERVIEW WAS LIKE THAT OF A HORROR IN A DREAM THAT WILL NOT LEAVE THE ROOM ALTHOUGH WE WAKEN UP AND RUB OUR EYES AND FORCE A STIFF RIGID SMILE UPON OUR LIPS
1564-142299-0015 IT IS THERE THERE COWERING AND GIBBERING WITH FIXED GHASTLY EYES IN SOME CORNER OF THE CHAMBER LISTENING TO HEAR WHETHER WE DARE TO BREATHE OF ITS PRESENCE TO ANY ONE AND WE DARE NOT
1564-142299-0016 POOR COWARDS THAT WE ARE AND SO SHE SHUDDERED AWAY FROM THE THREAT OF HIS ENDURING LOVE WHAT DID HE MEAN HAD SHE NOT THE POWER TO DAUNT HIM SHE WOULD SEE
1564-142299-0017 IT WAS MORE DARING THAN BECAME A MAN TO THREATEN HER SO DID HE GROUND IT UPON THE MISERABLE YESTERDAY IF NEED WERE SHE WOULD DO THE SAME TO MORROW BY A CRIPPLED BEGGAR WILLINGLY AND GLADLY BUT BY HIM SHE WOULD DO IT
1564-142299-0018 JUST AS BRAVELY IN SPITE OF HIS DEDUCTIONS AND THE COLD SLIME OF WOMEN'S IMPERTINENCE SHE DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT AND SIMPLE AND TRUE TO SAVE WHERE SHE COULD SAVE EVEN TO TRY TO SAVE
1564-142299-0019 HITHERTO SHE HAD NOT STIRRED FROM WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER NO OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCES HAD ROUSED HER OUT OF THE TRANCE OF THOUGHT IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN PLUNGED BY HIS LAST WORDS
1564-142299-0020 AND BY THE LOOK OF HIS DEEP INTENT PASSIONATE EYES AS THEIR FLAMES HAD MADE HER OWN FALL BEFORE THEM SHE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND THREW IT OPEN TO DISPEL THE OPPRESSION WHICH HUNG AROUND HER
1564-142299-0021 THEN SHE WENT AND OPENED THE DOOR WITH A SORT OF IMPETUOUS WISH TO SHAKE OFF THE RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST HOUR IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS OR IN ACTIVE EXERTION
1564-142299-0022 BUT ALL WAS PROFOUNDLY HUSHED IN THE NOONDAY STILLNESS OF A HOUSE WHERE AN INVALID CATCHES THE UNREFRESHING SLEEP THAT IS DENIED TO THE NIGHT HOURS
1564-142299-0023 MARGARET WOULD NOT BE ALONE WHAT SHOULD SHE DO GO AND SEE BESSY HIGGINS OF COURSE THOUGHT SHE AS THE RECOLLECTION OF THE MESSAGE SENT THE NIGHT BEFORE FLASHED INTO HER MIND
1564-142299-0024 AND AWAY SHE WENT WHEN SHE GOT THERE SHE FOUND BESSY LYING ON THE SETTLE MOVED CLOSE TO THE FIRE THOUGH THE DAY WAS SULTRY AND OPPRESSIVE SHE WAS LAID DOWN QUITE FLAT
1564-142299-0025 AS IF RESTING LANGUIDLY AFTER SOME PAROXYSM OF PAIN MARGARET FELT SURE SHE OUGHT TO HAVE THE GREATER FREEDOM OF BREATHING WHICH A MORE SITTING POSTURE WOULD PROCURE AND WITHOUT A WORD SHE RAISED HER UP
1564-142299-0026 AND SO ARRANGED THE PILLOWS THAT BESSY WAS MORE AT EASE THOUGH VERY LANGUID I THOUGHT I SHOULD NA HA SEEN YO AGAIN SAID SHE AT LAST LOOKING WISTFULLY IN MARGARET'S FACE
1564-142299-0027 I'M AFRAID YOU'RE MUCH WORSE BUT I COULD NOT HAVE COME YESTERDAY MY MOTHER WAS SO ILL FOR MANY REASONS SAID MARGARET COLOURING
1564-142299-0028 BUT THE WRANGLIN AND THE LOUD VOICES HAD JUST TORN ME TO PIECES AND I THOUGHT WHEN FATHER LEFT OH IF I COULD JUST HEAR HER VOICE READING ME SOME WORDS O PEACE AND PROMISE I COULD DIE AWAY INTO THE SILENCE AND REST O GOD
1564-142299-0029 SHALL I READ YOU A CHAPTER NOW AY DO
1564-142299-0030 IT WILL SEEM FAR AWAY BUT WHEN YO COME TO WORDS I LIKE
1564-142299-0031 IT'LL SEEM CLOSE IN MY EAR AND GOING THROUGH ME AS IT WERE MARGARET BEGAN BESSY TOSSED TO AND FRO IF BY AN EFFORT SHE ATTENDED FOR ONE MOMENT
1564-142299-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE WERE CONVULSED INTO DOUBLE RESTLESSNESS THE NEXT AT LAST SHE BURST OUT DON'T GO ON READING IT'S NO USE I'M BLASPHEMING ALL THE TIME IN MY MIND WI THINKING ANGRILY ON WHAT CANNA BE HELPED
1564-142299-0033 YOUR FATHER WAS NOT THERE WAS HE SAID MARGARET COLOURING DEEP NOT HE
1564-142299-0034 IT'S THAT THAT'S FRETTING ME
1564-142299-0035 BUT WHY ASKED MARGARET I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YO SEE HE'S A COMMITTEE MAN ON THIS SPECIAL STRIKE TH UNION APPOINTED HIM BECAUSE THOUGH I SAY IT AS SHOULDN'T SAY IT
1564-142299-0036 AND HE AND T OTHER COMMITTEE MEN LAID THEIR PLANS
1564-142299-0037 WHAT THE MAJOR PART THOUGHT T'OTHERS WERE TO THINK WHETHER THEY WOULD OR NO AND ABOVE ALL THERE WAS TO BE NO GOING AGAIN THE LAW OF THE LAND FOLK WOULD GO WITH THEM IF THEY SAW THEM STRIVING AND STARVING WI DUMB PATIENCE
1564-142299-0038 EVEN WI KNOBSTICKS ALL WAS UP
1564-142299-0039 AND BESIDE ALL THAT COMMITTEE KNEW THEY WERE RIGHT IN THEIR DEMAND AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE RIGHT ALL MIXED UP WI WRONG TILL FOLK CAN'T SEPARATE IT
1564-142299-0040 WELL I'VE TOLD YO AT LENGTH ABOUT THIS'N BUT I'M TIRED OUT
1564-142299-0041 AND BY SUCH A FOOL AS BOUCHER WHO MUST NEEDS GO RIGHT AGAIN THE ORDERS OF COMMITTEE
1564-142299-0042 BUT STEADY THOUGHTFUL MEN GOOD HANDS AND GOOD CITIZENS WHO WERE FRIENDLY TO LAW AND JUDGMENT AND WOULD UPHOLD ORDER WHO ONLY WANTED THEIR RIGHT WAGE AND WOULDN'T WORK EVEN THOUGH THEY STARVED TILL THEY GOT EM
1564-142299-0043 THAT'S NOT TRUE SAID MARGARET IT WAS NOT BOUCHER THAT THREW THE STONE' SHE WENT FIRST RED THEN WHITE YO'D BE THERE THEN WERE YO ASKED BESSY LANGUIDLY
1564-142299-0044 FOR INDEED SHE HAD SPOKEN WITH MANY PAUSES AS IF SPEECH WAS UNUSUALLY DIFFICULT TO HER YES NEVER MIND GO ON ONLY IT WAS NOT BOUCHER THAT THREW THE STONE
1564-142299-0045 HE DID NA SPEAK WORDS HE WERE ALL IN SUCH A TREMBLE WI SPENT PASSION I COULD NA BEAR TO LOOK AT HIM I HEARD HIS BREATH COMING QUICK AND AT ONE TIME I THOUGHT HE WERE SOBBING
1564-142299-0046 HE SAT DOWN A BIT AND PUT HIS HAND AFORE HIS EYES
1564-142299-0047 FATHER FATHER SAID I THOU'LL NEVER GO PEACH ON THAT POOR CLEMMED MAN
1564-142299-0048 DUNNOT BE A FOOL SAYS HE WORDS COME READIER THAN DEEDS TO MOST MEN
1564-142299-0049 AND I SHOULD NA HA MINDED IF SOME ONE ELSE HAD DONE THE DIRTY WORK AND GOT HIM CLAPPED UP BUT NOW HE HAS STRUCKEN ME I COULD DO IT LESS NOR EVER FOR IT WOULD BE GETTING OTHER MEN TO TAKE UP MY QUARREL BUT IF EVER HE GETS WELL O'ER THIS CLEMMING
1564-142299-0050 AND IS IN GOOD CONDITION HE AND I'LL HAVE AN UP AND DOWN FIGHT PURRING AN A AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR HIM AND SO FATHER SHOOK ME OFF FOR INDEED I WAS LOW AND FAINT ENOUGH
1564-142299-0051 AND TURNED ME SICK TO LOOK AT AND I KNOW NOT IF I SLEPT OR WAKED OR WERE IN A DEAD SWOON TILL MARY COME IN AND I TELLED HER TO FETCH YO TO ME
1564-142299-0052 I'M EASIER IN MY MIND FOR HAVING SPIT IT OUT BUT I WANT SOME THOUGHTS OF THE WORLD THAT'S FAR AWAY TO TAKE THE WEARY TASTE OF IT OUT O MY MOUTH READ ME NOT A SERMON CHAPTER BUT A STORY CHAPTER
1564-142299-0053 THEY'VE PICTURES IN THEM WHICH I SEE WHEN MY EYES ARE SHUT
1564-142299-0054 MARGARET READ IN HER SOFT LOW VOICE THOUGH BESSY'S EYES WERE SHUT SHE WAS LISTENING FOR SOME TIME FOR THE MOISTURE OF TEARS GATHERED HEAVY ON HER EYELASHES
1564-142299-0055 AT LAST SHE SLEPT WITH MANY STARTS AND MUTTERED PLEADINGS MARGARET COVERED HER UP AND LEFT HER FOR SHE HAD AN UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE MIGHT BE WANTED AT HOME AND YET UNTIL NOW IT SEEMED CRUEL TO LEAVE THE DYING GIRL
1564-142299-0056 MISSUS HALE WAS IN THE DRAWING ROOM ON HER DAUGHTER'S RETURN IT WAS ONE OF HER BETTER DAYS AND SHE WAS FULL OF PRAISES OF THE WATER BED IT HAD BEEN MORE LIKE THE BEDS AT SIR JOHN BERESFORD'S THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD SLEPT ON SINCE
1564-142299-0057 ONE WOULD THINK IT WAS EASY ENOUGH THERE WAS THE SAME KIND OF FEATHERS TO BE HAD AND YET SOMEHOW TILL THIS LAST NIGHT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHEN SHE HAD HAD A GOOD SOUND RESTING SLEEP
1564-142299-0058 MISTER HALE SUGGESTED THAT SOMETHING OF THE MERITS OF THE FEATHERBEDS OF FORMER DAYS MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACTIVITY OF YOUTH WHICH GAVE A RELISH TO REST BUT THIS IDEA WAS NOT KINDLY RECEIVED BY HIS WIFE NO INDEED MISTER HALE
1564-142299-0059 IT WAS THOSE BEDS AT SIR JOHN'S NOW MARGARET YOU'RE YOUNG ENOUGH AND GO ABOUT IN THE DAY ARE THE BEDS COMFORTABLE I APPEAL TO YOU DO THEY GIVE YOU A FEELING OF PERFECT REPOSE WHEN YOU LIE DOWN UPON THEM
1564-142299-0060 OR RATHER DON'T YOU TOSS ABOUT AND TRY IN VAIN TO FIND AN EASY POSITION AND WAKEN IN THE MORNING AS TIRED AS WHEN YOU WENT TO BED MARGARET LAUGHED TO TELL THE TRUTH MAMMA I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT MY BED AT ALL WHAT KIND IT IS
1564-142299-0061 I'M SO SLEEPY AT NIGHT THAT IF I ONLY LIE DOWN ANYWHERE I NAP OFF DIRECTLY SO I DON'T THINK I'M A COMPETENT WITNESS BUT THEN YOU KNOW I NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING SIR JOHN BERESFORD'S BEDS I NEVER WAS AT OXENHAM
1564-142299-0062 I ONLY WENT TO OXENHAM ONCE AFTER I WAS MARRIED TO YOUR AUNT SHAW'S WEDDING AND POOR LITTLE FRED WAS THE BABY THEN
1564-142299-0063 AND I KNOW DIXON DID NOT LIKE CHANGING FROM LADY'S MAID TO NURSE AND I WAS AFRAID THAT IF I TOOK HER NEAR HER OLD HOME AND AMONGST HER OWN PEOPLE SHE MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE ME BUT POOR BABY WAS TAKEN ILL AT OXENHAM WITH HIS TEETHING
1564-142299-0064 AND WHAT WITH MY BEING A GREAT DEAL WITH ANNA JUST BEFORE HER MARRIAGE AND NOT BEING VERY STRONG MYSELF DIXON HAD MORE OF THE CHARGE OF HIM THAN SHE EVER HAD BEFORE AND IT MADE HER SO FOND OF HIM
1564-142299-0065 AND SHE WAS SO PROUD WHEN HE WOULD TURN AWAY FROM EVERY ONE AND CLING TO HER THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SHE EVER THOUGHT OF LEAVING ME AGAIN THOUGH IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT SHE'D BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO POOR FRED
1564-142299-0066 EVERYBODY LOVED HIM HE WAS BORN WITH THE GIFT OF WINNING HEARTS IT MAKES ME THINK VERY BADLY OF CAPTAIN REID WHEN I KNOW THAT HE DISLIKED MY OWN DEAR BOY I THINK IT A CERTAIN PROOF HE HAD A BAD HEART AH
1564-142299-0067 YOUR POOR FATHER MARGARET HE HAS LEFT THE ROOM HE CAN'T BEAR TO HEAR FRED SPOKEN OF I LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT HIM MAMMA TELL ME ALL YOU LIKE YOU NEVER CAN TELL ME TOO MUCH TELL ME WHAT HE WAS LIKE AS A BABY
1564-142299-0068 WHY MARGARET YOU MUST NOT BE HURT BUT HE WAS MUCH PRETTIER THAN YOU WERE I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU IN DIXON'S ARMS I SAID DEAR WHAT AN UGLY LITTLE THING AND SHE SAID
1564-142299-0069 IT'S NOT EVERY CHILD THAT'S LIKE MASTER FRED BLESS HIM DEAR HOW WELL I REMEMBER IT THEN I COULD HAVE HAD FRED IN MY ARMS EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY AND HIS COT WAS CLOSE BY MY BED AND NOW
1564-142299-0070 NOW MARGARET I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY BOY IS AND SOMETIMES I THINK I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN MARGARET SAT DOWN BY HER MOTHER'S SOFA ON A LITTLE STOOL AND SOFTLY TOOK HOLD OF HER HAND
1564-142299-0071 CARESSING IT AND KISSING IT AS IF TO COMFORT MISSUS HALE CRIED WITHOUT RESTRAINT AT LAST SHE SAT STRAIGHT STIFF UP ON THE SOFA
1564-142299-0072 MARGARET IF I CAN GET BETTER IF GOD LETS ME HAVE A CHANCE OF RECOVERY IT MUST BE THROUGH SEEING MY SON FREDERICK ONCE MORE IT WILL WAKEN UP ALL THE POOR SPRINGS OF HEALTH LEFT IN ME
1564-142299-0073 SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO TRY AND GATHER STRENGTH FOR SOMETHING MORE YET TO BE SAID HER VOICE WAS CHOKED AS SHE WENT ON WAS QUAVERING AS WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF SOME STRANGE YET CLOSELY PRESENT IDEA
1564-142299-0074 AND MARGARET IF I AM TO DIE IF I AM ONE OF THOSE APPOINTED TO DIE BEFORE MANY WEEKS ARE OVER I MUST SEE MY CHILD FIRST I CANNOT THINK HOW IT MUST BE MANAGED
1564-142299-0075 BUT I CHARGE YOU MARGARET AS YOU YOURSELF HOPE FOR COMFORT IN YOUR LAST ILLNESS BRING HIM TO ME THAT I MAY BLESS HIM ONLY FOR FIVE MINUTES MARGARET THERE COULD BE NO DANGER IN FIVE MINUTES OH MARGARET LET ME SEE HIM BEFORE I DIE
1564-142299-0076 MARGARET DID NOT THINK OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE UTTERLY UNREASONABLE IN THIS SPEECH WE DO NOT LOOK FOR REASON OR LOGIC IN THE PASSIONATE ENTREATIES OF THOSE WHO ARE SICK UNTO DEATH
1564-142299-0077 WHO WILL SOON PASS AWAY FROM AMONG US AND DO THEY ASK US FOR THE FUTURE HAPPINESS OF OUR LIVES WE LAY IT AT THEIR FEET AND WILL IT AWAY FROM US BUT THIS WISH OF MISSUS HALE'S WAS SO NATURAL SO JUST
1564-142299-0078 SO RIGHT TO BOTH PARTIES THAT MARGARET FELT AS IF ON FREDERICK'S ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ON HER MOTHER'S SHE OUGHT TO OVERLOOK ALL INTERMEDIATE CHANCES OF DANGER AND PLEDGE HERSELF TO DO EVERYTHING IN HER POWER FOR ITS REALISATION
1564-142299-0079 STEADY IN THEIR GAZE THOUGH THE POOR WHITE LIPS QUIVERED LIKE THOSE OF A CHILD MARGARET GENTLY ROSE UP AND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER FRAIL MOTHER SO THAT SHE MIGHT GATHER THE SECURE FULFILMENT OF HER WISH FROM THE CALM STEADINESS OF HER DAUGHTER'S FACE
1564-142299-0080 MAMMA I WILL WRITE TO NIGHT AND TELL FREDERICK WHAT YOU SAY I AM AS SURE THAT HE WILL COME DIRECTLY TO US AS I AM SURE OF MY LIFE
1564-142299-0081 YOU WILL WRITE TO NIGHT OH MARGARET THE POST GOES OUT AT FIVE YOU WILL WRITE BY IT WON'T YOU I HAVE SO FEW HOURS LEFT I FEEL DEAR AS IF I SHOULD NOT RECOVER
1564-142299-0082 THOUGH SOMETIMES YOUR FATHER OVER PERSUADES ME INTO HOPING YOU WILL WRITE DIRECTLY WON'T YOU DON'T LOSE A SINGLE POST FOR JUST BY THAT VERY POST I MAY MISS HIM BUT MAMMA PAPA IS OUT PAPA IS OUT
1564-142299-0083 AND WHAT THEN DO YOU MEAN THAT HE WOULD DENY ME THIS LAST WISH MARGARET WHY I SHOULD NOT BE ILL BE DYING IF HE HAD NOT TAKEN ME AWAY FROM HELSTONE TO THIS UNHEALTHY SMOKY SUNLESS PLACE
1564-142299-0084 YES IT IS SO INDEED HE KNOWS IT HIMSELF HE HAS SAID SO MANY A TIME HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR ME YOU DON'T MEAN HE WOULD REFUSE ME THIS LAST WISH PRAYER IF YOU WILL
1564-142299-0085 AND INDEED MARGARET THE LONGING TO SEE FREDERICK STANDS BETWEEN ME AND GOD I CANNOT PRAY TILL I HAVE THIS ONE THING INDEED I CANNOT DON'T LOSE TIME DEAR DEAR MARGARET
1564-142299-0086 WRITE BY THIS VERY NEXT POST THEN HE MAY BE HERE HERE IN TWENTY TWO DAYS FOR HE IS SURE TO COME NO CORDS OR CHAINS CAN KEEP HIM IN TWENTY TWO DAYS I SHALL SEE MY BOY
1564-142299-0087 SHE FELL BACK AND FOR A SHORT TIME SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE FACT THAT MARGARET SAT MOTIONLESS HER HAND SHADING HER EYES YOU ARE NOT WRITING SAID HER MOTHER AT LAST
1564-142299-0088 BRING ME SOME PENS AND PAPER I WILL TRY AND WRITE MYSELF SHE SAT UP TREMBLING ALL OVER WITH FEVERISH EAGERNESS MARGARET TOOK HER HAND DOWN AND LOOKED AT HER MOTHER SADLY ONLY WAIT TILL PAPA COMES IN
1564-142299-0089 YOU PROMISED MARGARET NOT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AGO YOU SAID HE SHOULD COME AND SO HE SHALL MAMMA DON'T CRY MY OWN DEAR MOTHER I'LL WRITE HERE NOW YOU SHALL SEE ME WRITE
1564-142299-0090 AND IT SHALL GO BY THIS VERY POST AND IF PAPA THINKS FIT HE CAN WRITE AGAIN WHEN HE COMES IN IT IS ONLY A DAY'S DELAY OH MAMMA DON'T CRY SO PITIFULLY IT CUTS ME TO THE HEART
1564-142299-0091 MISSUS HALE COULD NOT STOP HER TEARS THEY CAME HYSTERICALLY AND IN TRUTH SHE MADE NO EFFORT TO CONTROL THEM BUT RATHER CALLED UP ALL THE PICTURES OF THE HAPPY PAST AND THE PROBABLE FUTURE
1564-142299-0092 PAINTING THE SCENE WHEN SHE SHOULD LIE A CORPSE WITH THE SON SHE HAD LONGED TO SEE IN LIFE WEEPING OVER HER AND SHE UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS PRESENCE TILL SHE WAS MELTED BY SELF PITY INTO A STATE OF SOBBING AND EXHAUSTION
1564-142299-0093 THAT MADE MARGARET'S HEART ACHE BUT AT LAST SHE WAS CALM AND GREEDILY WATCHED HER DAUGHTER AS SHE BEGAN HER LETTER WROTE IT WITH SWIFT URGENT ENTREATY SEALED IT UP HURRIEDLY FOR FEAR HER MOTHER SHOULD ASK TO SEE IT
1564-142299-0094 AND THEN TO MAKE SECURITY MOST SURE AT MISSUS HALE'S OWN BIDDING TOOK IT HERSELF TO THE POST OFFICE SHE WAS COMING HOME WHEN HER FATHER OVERTOOK HER
1564-142299-0095 AND WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN MY PRETTY MAID ASKED HE TO THE POST OFFICE WITH A LETTER A LETTER TO FREDERICK
1564-142299-0096 SHE SAID IT WOULD MAKE HER WELL AGAIN AND THEN SHE SAID THAT SHE MUST SEE HIM BEFORE SHE DIED I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW URGENT SHE WAS DID I DO WRONG MISTER HALE DID NOT REPLY AT FIRST THEN HE SAID
1564-142299-0097 YOU SHOULD HAVE WAITED TILL I CAME IN MARGARET I TRIED TO PERSUADE HER AND THEN SHE WAS SILENT I DON'T KNOW SAID MISTER HALE AFTER A PAUSE
1564-142299-0098 SHE OUGHT TO SEE HIM IF SHE WISHES IT SO MUCH FOR I BELIEVE IT WOULD DO HER MUCH MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE DOCTOR'S MEDICINE AND PERHAPS SET HER UP ALTOGETHER BUT THE DANGER TO HIM I'M AFRAID IS VERY GREAT
1564-142299-0099 ALL THESE YEARS SINCE THE MUTINY PAPA YES IT IS NECESSARY OF COURSE FOR GOVERNMENT TO TAKE VERY STRINGENT MEASURES FOR THE REPRESSION OF OFFENCES AGAINST AUTHORITY
1564-142299-0100 MORE PARTICULARLY IN THE NAVY WHERE A COMMANDING OFFICER NEEDS TO BE SURROUNDED IN HIS MEN'S EYES WITH A VIVID CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THE POWER THERE IS AT HOME TO BACK HIM AND TAKE UP HIS CAUSE AND AVENGE ANY INJURIES OFFERED TO HIM IF NEED BE
1564-142299-0101 AH IT'S NO MATTER TO THEM HOW FAR THEIR AUTHORITIES HAVE TYRANNISED GALLED HASTY TEMPERS TO MADNESS OR IF THAT CAN BE ANY EXCUSE AFTERWARDS IT IS NEVER ALLOWED FOR IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
1564-142299-0102 THEY SPARE NO EXPENSE THEY SEND OUT SHIPS THEY SCOUR THE SEAS TO LAY HOLD OF THE OFFENDERS THE LAPSE OF YEARS DOES NOT WASH OUT THE MEMORY OF THE OFFENCE IT IS A FRESH AND VIVID CRIME ON THE ADMIRALTY BOOKS TILL IT IS BLOTTED OUT BY BLOOD
1564-142299-0103 I'M SURE FREDERICK HIMSELF WOULD RUN THE RISK SO HE WOULD SO HE SHOULD NAY MARGARET I'M GLAD IT IS DONE THOUGH I DURST NOT HAVE DONE IT MYSELF
1564-142299-0104 I'M THANKFUL IT IS AS IT IS I SHOULD HAVE HESITATED TILL PERHAPS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO LATE TO DO ANY GOOD DEAR MARGARET YOU HAVE DONE WHAT IS RIGHT ABOUT IT AND THE END IS BEYOND OUR CONTROL
1564-142299-0105 IT WAS ALL VERY WELL BUT HER FATHER'S ACCOUNT OF THE RELENTLESS MANNER IN WHICH MUTINIES WERE PUNISHED MADE MARGARET SHIVER AND CREEP
1564-142299-0106 IF SHE HAD DECOYED HER BROTHER HOME TO BLOT OUT THE MEMORY OF HIS ERROR BY HIS BLOOD SHE SAW HER FATHER'S ANXIETY LAY DEEPER THAN THE SOURCE OF HIS LATTER CHEERING WORDS
