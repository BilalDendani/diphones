2137-131751-0000 EDISON'S NEW STORAGE BATTERY GENERICALLY CONSIDERED A BATTERY IS A DEVICE WHICH GENERATES ELECTRIC CURRENT THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT SPECIES OF BATTERY ONE BEING KNOWN AS PRIMARY
2137-131751-0001 CONTAINS AT LEAST TWO ELEMENTS OF DIFFERENT NATURE IMMERSED IN A MORE OR LESS LIQUID ELECTROLYTE OF CHEMICAL CHARACTER ON CLOSING THE CIRCUIT OF A PRIMARY BATTERY AN ELECTRIC CURRENT IS GENERATED
2137-131751-0002 IT IS A REVERSIBLE BATTERY AS WILL BE QUITE OBVIOUS IF WE GLANCE BRIEFLY AT ITS PHILOSOPHY WHEN A STORAGE BATTERY IS CHARGED BY HAVING AN ELECTRIC CURRENT PASSED THROUGH IT THE ELECTRIC ENERGY PRODUCES A CHEMICAL EFFECT
2137-131751-0003 THE BATTERY IS READY FOR USE AND UPON ITS CIRCUIT BEING CLOSED THROUGH A TRANSLATING DEVICE SUCH AS A LAMP OR MOTOR A REVERSION DISCHARGE TAKES PLACE THE POSITIVE PLATE GIVING UP ITS OXYGEN AND THE NEGATIVE PLATE BEING OXIDIZED
2137-131751-0004 THE STORAGE BATTERY AS A COMMERCIAL ARTICLE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE MARKET IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE AT THAT TIME AND ALL THROUGH THE SUCCEEDING YEARS UNTIL ABOUT NINETEEN O FIVE THERE WAS ONLY ONE TYPE THAT WAS RECOGNIZED AS COMMERCIALLY PRACTICABLE
2137-131751-0005 NAMELY THAT KNOWN AS THE LEAD SULPHURIC ACID CELL CONSISTING OF LEAD PLATES IMMERSED IN AN ELECTROLYTE OF DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID IN THE YEAR LAST NAMED EDISON FIRST BROUGHT OUT HIS NEW FORM OF NICKEL IRON CELL WITH ALKALINE ELECTROLYTE
2137-131751-0006 AS WE HAVE RELATED IN THE PRECEDING NARRATIVE EARLY IN THE EIGHTIES AT MENLO PARK HE HAD GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT TO THE LEAD TYPE OF STORAGE BATTERY AND DURING THE COURSE OF THREE YEARS HAD MADE A PRODIGIOUS NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS IN THE DIRECTION OF IMPROVING IT
2137-131751-0007 PROBABLY PERFORMING MORE EXPERIMENTS IN THAT TIME THAN THE AGGREGATE OF THOSE OF ALL OTHER INVESTIGATORS EVEN IN THOSE EARLY DAYS HE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE LEAD SULPHURIC ACID COMBINATION WAS INTRINSICALLY WRONG AND DID NOT EMBRACE THE ELEMENTS
2137-131751-0008 OF A PERMANENT COMMERCIAL DEVICE HE DID NOT AT THAT TIME HOWEVER ENGAGE IN A SERIOUS SEARCH FOR ANOTHER FORM OF STORAGE BATTERY BEING TREMENDOUSLY OCCUPIED WITH HIS LIGHTING SYSTEM AND OTHER MATTERS IT MAY HERE BE NOTED
2137-131751-0009 FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE LAY READER THAT THE LEAD ACID TYPE OF STORAGE BATTERY CONSISTS OF TWO OR MORE LEAD PLATES IMMERSED IN DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND CONTAINED IN A RECEPTACLE OF GLASS HARD RUBBER OR OTHER SPECIAL MATERIAL NOT ACTED UPON BY ACID
2137-131751-0010 HAS MANY SERIOUS DISADVANTAGES INHERENT TO ITS VERY NATURE WE WILL NAME A FEW OF THEM BRIEFLY CONSTANT DROPPING OF FINE PARTICLES OF ACTIVE MATERIAL OFTEN CAUSES SHORT CIRCUITING OF THE PLATES AND ALWAYS NECESSITATES OCCASIONAL WASHING OUT OF CELLS
2137-131751-0011 THE TENDENCY OF LEAD PLATES TO BUCKLE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE LIMITATION TO THE USE OF GLASS HARD RUBBER OR SIMILAR CONTAINERS ON ACCOUNT OF THE ACTION OF THE ACID AND THE IMMENSE WEIGHT FOR ELECTRICAL CAPACITY
2137-131751-0012 THE TREMENDOUSLY COMPLEX NATURE OF THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE LEAD ACID STORAGE BATTERY ALSO RENDERS IT AN EASY PREY TO MANY TROUBLESOME DISEASES IN THE YEAR NINETEEN HUNDRED WHEN EDISON UNDERTOOK TO INVENT A STORAGE BATTERY
2137-131751-0013 THE SOUNDNESS OF HIS REASONING IS AMPLY JUSTIFIED BY THE PERFECTION OF RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE NEW TYPE OF STORAGE BATTERY BEARING HIS NAME AND NOW TO BE DESCRIBED
2137-131751-0014 THE ESSENTIAL TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THIS BATTERY ARE FULLY DESCRIBED IN AN ARTICLE WRITTEN BY ONE OF EDISON'S LABORATORY STAFF WALTER E HOLLAND WHO FOR MANY YEARS HAS BEEN CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH THE INVENTOR'S WORK ON THIS CELL
2137-131751-0015 THE A TYPE EDISON CELL IS THE OUTCOME OF NINE YEARS OF COSTLY EXPERIMENTATION AND PERSISTENT TOIL ON THE PART OF ITS INVENTOR AND HIS ASSOCIATES
2137-131751-0016 THE EDISON INVENTION INVOLVES THE USE OF AN ENTIRELY NEW VOLTAIC COMBINATION IN AN ALKALINE ELECTROLYTE IN PLACE OF THE LEAD LEAD PEROXIDE COMBINATION AND ACID ELECTROLYTE CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL STORAGE BATTERIES
2137-131751-0017 THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE ACTION OF THIS NEW BATTERY IS BASED IS THE OXIDATION AND REDUCTION OF METALS IN AN ELECTROLYTE WHICH DOES NOT COMBINE WITH AND WILL NOT DISSOLVE EITHER THE METALS OR THEIR OXIDES AND AN ELECTROLYTE FURTHERMORE
2137-131751-0018 WHICH ALTHOUGH DECOMPOSED BY THE ACTION OF THE BATTERY IS IMMEDIATELY RE FORMED IN EQUAL QUANTITY AND THEREFORE IN EFFECT IS A CONSTANT ELEMENT NOT CHANGING IN DENSITY OR IN CONDUCTIVITY A BATTERY EMBODYING THIS BASIC PRINCIPLE
2137-131751-0019 BY ACTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE NO MATTER HOW LONG CONTINUED THE ELECTROLYTE OF THE EDISON BATTERY IS A TWENTY ONE PER CENT SOLUTION OF POTASSIUM HYDRATE HAVING IN ADDITION A SMALL AMOUNT OF LITHIUM HYDRATE
2137-131751-0020 THE ACTIVE METALS OF THE ELECTRODES WHICH WILL OXIDIZE AND REDUCE IN THIS ELECTROLYTE WITHOUT DISSOLUTION OR CHEMICAL DETERIORATION ARE NICKEL AND IRON
2137-131751-0021 WAS THE PREPARATION OF THESE MATERIALS METALLIC POWDER OF IRON AND NICKEL OR EVEN OXIDES OF THESE METALS PREPARED IN THE ORDINARY WAY ARE NOT CHEMICALLY ACTIVE IN A SUFFICIENT DEGREE TO WORK IN A BATTERY
2137-131751-0022 SHOWING SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED AND THE VARIOUS DISCOVERIES MADE IN DEVELOPING THE PERFECTED CELL AFTER WHICH THE WRITER CONTINUES HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE A TYPE CELL AS FOLLOWS
2137-131751-0023 IT WILL BE SEEN AT ONCE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TWO KINDS OF PLATE IS RADICALLY DIFFERENT THE NEGATIVE OR IRON PLATE FIG FIVE HAS THE FAMILIAR FLAT POCKET CONSTRUCTION EACH NEGATIVE CONTAINS TWENTY FOUR POCKETS
2137-131751-0024 AND HAVING A MAXIMUM THICKNESS OF A LITTLE MORE THAN ONE EIGHTH INCH THE POSITIVE OR NICKEL PLATE
2137-131751-0025 IS SEEN TO CONSIST OF TWO ROWS OF ROUND RODS OR PENCILS THIRTY IN NUMBER HELD IN A VERTICAL POSITION BY A STEEL SUPPORT FRAME THE PENCILS HAVE FLAT FLANGES AT THE ENDS
2137-131751-0026 AND THE RESULTANT PLATE HAS GREAT RIGIDITY AND STRENGTH THE PERFORATED TUBES INTO WHICH THE NICKEL ACTIVE MATERIAL IS LOADED ARE MADE OF NICKEL PLATED STEEL OF HIGH QUALITY THEY ARE PUT TOGETHER WITH A DOUBLE LAPPED SPIRAL SEAM
2137-131751-0027 TO GIVE EXPANSION RESISTING QUALITIES AND AS AN ADDITIONAL PRECAUTION SMALL METAL RINGS ARE SLIPPED ON THE OUTSIDE EACH TUBE IS ONE QUARTER INCH IN DIAMETER BY FOUR AND ONE EIGHTH INCHES LONG ADD HAS EIGHT OF THE REINFORCING RINGS
2137-131751-0028 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE A POSITIVE PLATE HAS BEEN GIVEN THE THEORETICALLY BEST DESIGN TO PREVENT EXPANSION AND OVERCOME TROUBLE FROM THAT CAUSE ACTUAL TESTS LONG CONTINUED UNDER VERY SEVERE CONDITIONS
2137-131751-0029 HAVE SHOWN THAT THE CONSTRUCTION IS RIGHT AND FULFILS THE MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS
2137-131751-0030 AS THE CONDUCTING FACTOR IN THE POSITIVE ELEMENT
2137-131751-0031 WHICH HAS BEEN SAWED LENGTHWISE THE VERTICAL BOUNDING WALLS ARE EDGES OF THE PERFORATED METAL CONTAINING TUBE THE DARK HORIZONTAL LINES ARE LAYERS OF NICKEL FLAKE WHILE THE LIGHT COLORED THICKER LAYERS REPRESENT THE NICKEL HYDRATE
2137-131751-0032 IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE LAYERS OF FLAKE NICKEL EXTEND PRACTICALLY UNBROKEN ACROSS THE TUBE
2137-131751-0033 THESE METAL LAYERS CONDUCT CURRENT TO OR FROM THE ACTIVE NICKEL HYDRATE IN ALL PARTS OF THE TUBE VERY EFFICIENTLY THERE ARE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LAYERS OF EACH KIND OF MATERIAL IN A FOUR AND ONE EIGHTH INCH TUBE
2137-131751-0034 SO IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE CURRENT DOES NOT HAVE TO PENETRATE VERY FAR INTO THE NICKEL HYDRATE ONE HALF A LAYER'S THICKNESS BEING THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE THE PERFORATIONS OF THE CONTAINING TUBE THROUGH WHICH THE ELECTROLYTE REACHES THE ACTIVE MATERIAL
2137-131751-0035 IN CONCLUSION THE ARTICLE ENUMERATES THE CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EDISON STORAGE BATTERY WHICH FIT IT PREEMINENTLY FOR TRANSPORTATION SERVICE AS FOLLOWS ONE NO LOSS OF ACTIVE MATERIAL HENCE NO SEDIMENT SHORT CIRCUITS
2137-131751-0036 TWO NO JAR BREAKAGE THREE POSSIBILITY OF QUICK DISCONNECTION OR REPLACEMENT OF ANY CELL WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT OF SKILLED LABOR FOUR IMPOSSIBILITY OF BUCKLING
2137-131751-0037 AND HARMLESSNESS OF A DEAD SHORT CIRCUIT FIVE SIMPLICITY OF CARE REQUIRED SIX DURABILITY OF MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION SEVEN IMPOSSIBILITY OF SULPHATION
2137-131751-0038 EIGHT ENTIRE ABSENCE OF CORROSIVE FUMES NINE COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGES OF LIGHT WEIGHT TEN DURATION ON ACCOUNT OF ITS DEPENDABILITY
