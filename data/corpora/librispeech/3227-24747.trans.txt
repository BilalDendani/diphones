3227-24747-0000 THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ETERNAL AND INFINITE ESSENCE OF GOD WHICH EVERY IDEA INVOLVES IS ADEQUATE AND PERFECT
3227-24747-0001 THE PROOF OF THE LAST PROPOSITION IS UNIVERSAL AND WHETHER A THING BE CONSIDERED AS A PART OR A WHOLE THE IDEA THEREOF WHETHER OF THE WHOLE OR OF A PART
3227-24747-0002 WILL INVOLVE GOD'S ETERNAL AND INFINITE ESSENCE WHEREFORE THAT WHICH GIVES KNOWLEDGE OF THE ETERNAL AND INFINITE ESSENCE OF GOD IS COMMON TO ALL
3227-24747-0003 NOTE HENCE WE SEE THAT THE INFINITE ESSENCE AND THE ETERNITY OF GOD ARE KNOWN TO ALL NOW AS ALL THINGS ARE IN GOD AND ARE CONCEIVED THROUGH GOD
3227-24747-0004 WE CAN FROM THIS KNOWLEDGE INFER MANY THINGS WHICH WE MAY ADEQUATELY KNOW AND WE MAY FORM THAT THIRD KIND OF KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH WE SPOKE
3227-24747-0005 MEN HAVE NOT SO CLEAR A KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AS THEY HAVE OF GENERAL NOTIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO IMAGINE GOD AS THEY DO BODIES AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY HAVE ASSOCIATED THE NAME GOD
3227-24747-0006 WITH IMAGES OF THINGS THAT THEY ARE IN THE HABIT OF SEEING
3227-24747-0007 AND CONTINUALLY AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES MANY ERRORS IN TRUTH CAN BE TRACED TO THIS HEAD
3227-24747-0008 HE THEN AT ALL EVENTS ASSUREDLY ATTACHES A MEANING TO THE WORD CIRCLE
3227-24747-0009 AFTER WE HAVE PROVED THAT THESE FACULTIES OF OURS ARE GENERAL NOTIONS WHICH CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE PARTICULAR INSTANCES ON WHICH THEY ARE BASED
3227-24747-0010 WE MUST INQUIRE WHETHER VOLITIONS THEMSELVES ARE ANYTHING BESIDES THE IDEAS OF THINGS WE MUST INQUIRE I SAY WHETHER THERE IS IN THE MIND ANY AFFIRMATION OR NEGATION BEYOND THAT
3227-24747-0011 WHICH THE IDEA IN SO FAR AS IT IS AN IDEA INVOLVES
3227-24747-0012 LEST THE IDEA OF PICTURES SHOULD SUGGEST ITSELF
3227-24747-0013 OR IN THE MIDST OF THE BRAIN BUT THE CONCEPTIONS OF THOUGHT
3227-24747-0014 SAVE THAT WHICH AN IDEA INASMUCH AS IT IS AN IDEA INVOLVES
3227-24747-0015 THERE IS IN THE MIND NO ABSOLUTE FACULTY OF POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE VOLITION BUT ONLY PARTICULAR VOLITIONS NAMELY THIS OR THAT AFFIRMATION
3227-24747-0016 NOW LET US CONCEIVE A PARTICULAR VOLITION
3227-24747-0017 ARE EQUAL TO TWO RIGHT ANGLES THIS AFFIRMATION INVOLVES THE CONCEPTION OR IDEA OF A TRIANGLE THAT IS WITHOUT THE IDEA OF A TRIANGLE IT CANNOT BE CONCEIVED
3227-24747-0018 IT IS THE SAME THING TO SAY THAT THE CONCEPT A MUST INVOLVE THE CONCEPT B AS IT IS TO SAY THAT A CANNOT BE CONCEIVED WITHOUT B
3227-24747-0019 WITHOUT THE IDEA OF A TRIANGLE THEREFORE
3227-24747-0020 AGAIN THIS IDEA OF A TRIANGLE MUST INVOLVE THIS SAME AFFIRMATION NAMELY THAT ITS THREE INTERIOR ANGLES ARE EQUAL TO TWO RIGHT ANGLES WHEREFORE AND VICE VERSA
3227-24747-0021 THIS IDEA OF A TRIANGLE CAN NEITHER BE NOR BE CONCEIVED WITHOUT THIS AFFIRMATION THEREFORE THIS AFFIRMATION BELONGS TO THE ESSENCE OF THE IDEA OF A TRIANGLE AND IS NOTHING BESIDES
3227-24747-0022 INASMUCH AS WE HAVE SELECTED IT AT RANDOM MAY BE SAID OF ANY OTHER VOLITION
3227-24747-0023 IN ORDER THAT THE FOREGOING PROPOSITION MAY BE FULLY EXPLAINED I WILL DRAW ATTENTION TO A FEW ADDITIONAL POINTS AND I WILL FURTHERMORE ANSWER THE OBJECTIONS WHICH MAY BE ADVANCED AGAINST OUR DOCTRINE LASTLY
3227-24747-0024 IN ORDER TO REMOVE EVERY SCRUPLE I HAVE THOUGHT IT WORTH WHILE TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES WHICH FOLLOW THEREFROM
3227-24747-0025 THOSE WHO THINK THAT IDEAS CONSIST IN IMAGES WHICH ARE FORMED IN US BY CONTACT WITH EXTERNAL BODIES PERSUADE THEMSELVES THAT THE IDEAS OF THOSE THINGS WHEREOF WE CAN FORM NO MENTAL PICTURE
3227-24747-0026 THEY THUS REGARD IDEAS AS THOUGH THEY WERE INANIMATE PICTURES ON A PANEL AND FILLED WITH THIS MISCONCEPTION DO NOT SEE THAT AN IDEA INASMUCH AS IT IS AN IDEA
3227-24747-0027 INVOLVES AN AFFIRMATION OR NEGATION AGAIN THOSE WHO CONFUSE WORDS WITH IDEAS OR WITH THE AFFIRMATION WHICH AN IDEA INVOLVES THINK THAT THEY CAN WISH SOMETHING CONTRARY TO WHAT THEY FEEL AFFIRM OR DENY
3227-24747-0028 THIS MISCONCEPTION WILL EASILY BE LAID ASIDE BY ONE WHO REFLECTS ON THE NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE AND SEEING THAT IT IN NO WISE INVOLVES THE CONCEPTION OF EXTENSION WILL THEREFORE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND
3227-24747-0029 DOES NOT CONSIST IN THE IMAGE OF ANYTHING NOR IN WORDS THE ESSENCE OF WORDS AND IMAGES IS PUT TOGETHER BY BODILY MOTIONS WHICH IN NO WISE INVOLVE THE CONCEPTION OF THOUGHT THESE FEW WORDS ON THIS SUBJECT WILL SUFFICE
3227-24747-0030 I WILL THEREFORE PASS ON TO CONSIDER THE OBJECTIONS WHICH MAY BE RAISED AGAINST OUR DOCTRINE OF THESE THE FIRST IS ADVANCED BY THOSE WHO THINK THAT THE WILL HAS A WIDER SCOPE THAN THE UNDERSTANDING
3227-24747-0031 THAN THE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY ASSERT THAT
3227-24747-0032 THAT IS OF AFFIRMATION OR NEGATION IN ORDER TO ASSENT TO AN INFINITY OF THINGS WHICH WE DO NOT PERCEIVE BUT THAT THEY HAVE NEED OF AN INCREASE IN THEIR FACULTY OF UNDERSTANDING
3227-24747-0033 THE WILL IS THUS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE INTELLECT
3227-24747-0034 THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SUSPEND OUR JUDGMENT BEFORE ASSENTING TO THINGS WHICH WE PERCEIVE THIS IS CONFIRMED BY THE FACT
3227-24747-0035 THAT NO ONE IS SAID TO BE DECEIVED IN SO FAR AS HE PERCEIVES ANYTHING BUT ONLY IN SO FAR AS HE ASSENTS OR DISSENTS FOR INSTANCE HE WHO FEIGNS A WINGED HORSE
3227-24747-0036 DOES NOT THEREFORE ADMIT THAT A WINGED HORSE EXISTS THAT IS HE IS NOT DECEIVED UNLESS HE ADMITS IN ADDITION THAT A WINGED HORSE DOES EXIST NOTHING THEREFORE SEEMS TO BE TAUGHT MORE CLEARLY BY EXPERIENCE
3227-24747-0037 THAN THAT THE WILL OR FACULTY OF ASSENT IS FREE AND DIFFERENT FROM THE FACULTY OF UNDERSTANDING THIRDLY
3227-24747-0038 FOR AS OBJECTS ARE SOME MORE EXCELLENT THAN OTHERS SO ALSO ARE THE IDEAS OF THEM SOME MORE EXCELLENT THAN OTHERS THIS ALSO SEEMS TO POINT TO A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE WILL
3227-24747-0039 FOURTHLY IT MAY BE OBJECTED IF MAN DOES NOT ACT FROM FREE WILL WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE INCENTIVES TO ACTION ARE EQUALLY BALANCED
3227-24747-0040 AS IN THE CASE OF BURIDAN'S ASS WILL HE PERISH OF HUNGER AND THIRST IF I SAY THAT HE WOULD I SHALL SEEM TO HAVE IN MY THOUGHTS AN ASS OR THE STATUE OF A MAN
3227-24747-0041 RATHER THAN AN ACTUAL MAN IF I SAY THAT HE WOULD NOT HE WOULD THEN DETERMINE HIS OWN ACTION AND WOULD CONSEQUENTLY POSSESS THE FACULTY OF GOING AND DOING WHATEVER HE LIKED OTHER OBJECTIONS MIGHT ALSO BE RAISED
3227-24747-0042 I WILL ONLY SET MYSELF TO THE TASK OF REFUTING THOSE I HAVE MENTIONED
3227-24747-0043 THAT I ADMIT THAT THE WILL HAS A WIDER SCOPE THAN THE UNDERSTANDING
3227-24747-0044 AND THE FACULTY OF FORMING CONCEPTIONS NOR DO I SEE WHY THE FACULTY OF VOLITION SHOULD BE CALLED INFINITE ANY MORE THAN THE FACULTY OF FEELING FOR AS WE ARE ABLE BY THE SAME FACULTY OF VOLITION TO AFFIRM AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THINGS
3227-24747-0045 SO ALSO CAN WE BY THE SAME FACULTY OF FEELING FEEL OR PERCEIVE IN SUCCESSION AN INFINITE NUMBER OF BODIES IF IT BE SAID THAT THERE IS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH WE CANNOT PERCEIVE
3227-24747-0046 I ANSWER THAT WE CANNOT ATTAIN TO SUCH THINGS BY ANY THINKING NOR CONSEQUENTLY BY ANY FACULTY OF VOLITION BUT IT MAY STILL BE URGED
3227-24747-0047 IF GOD WISHED TO BRING IT ABOUT THAT WE SHOULD PERCEIVE THEM HE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ENDOW US WITH A GREATER FACULTY OF PERCEPTION BUT NOT A GREATER FACULTY OF VOLITION THAN WE HAVE ALREADY
3227-24747-0048 THIS IS THE SAME AS TO SAY THAT IF GOD WISHED TO BRING IT ABOUT THAT WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND AN INFINITE NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO GIVE US A GREATER UNDERSTANDING
3227-24747-0049 BUT NOT A MORE UNIVERSAL IDEA OF ENTITY THAN THAT WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY IN ORDER TO GRASP SUCH INFINITE ENTITIES WE HAVE SHOWN THAT WILL IS A UNIVERSAL ENTITY OR IDEA
3227-24747-0050 WHEREBY WE EXPLAIN ALL PARTICULAR VOLITIONS
3227-24747-0051 COMMON OR UNIVERSAL TO ALL VOLITIONS IS A FACULTY IT IS LITTLE TO BE WONDERED AT THAT THEY ASSERT THAT SUCH A FACULTY EXTENDS ITSELF INTO THE INFINITE BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE UNDERSTANDING
3227-24747-0052 FOR WHAT IS UNIVERSAL IS PREDICATED ALIKE OF ONE OF MANY AND OF AN INFINITE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS TO THE SECOND OBJECTION
3227-24747-0053 I REPLY BY DENYING THAT WE HAVE A FREE POWER OF SUSPENDING OUR JUDGMENT FOR WHEN WE SAY THAT ANYONE SUSPENDS HIS JUDGMENT WE MERELY MEAN THAT HE SEES THAT HE DOES NOT PERCEIVE THE MATTER IN QUESTION ADEQUATELY
3227-24747-0054 STRICTLY SPEAKING A PERCEPTION AND NOT FREE WILL IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THE POINT
3227-24747-0055 HE WILL NECESSARILY REGARD THE HORSE AS PRESENT HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DOUBT OF ITS EXISTENCE ALTHOUGH HE BE NOT CERTAIN THEREOF WE HAVE DAILY EXPERIENCE OF SUCH A STATE OF THINGS IN DREAMS
3227-24747-0056 THAT WHILE HE IS DREAMING HE HAS THE FREE POWER OF SUSPENDING HIS JUDGMENT CONCERNING THE THINGS IN HIS DREAM AND BRINGING IT ABOUT THAT HE SHOULD NOT DREAM THOSE THINGS WHICH HE DREAMS THAT HE SEES
3227-24747-0057 YET IT HAPPENS NOTWITHSTANDING
3227-24747-0058 NAMELY WHEN WE DREAM THAT WE ARE DREAMING FURTHER I GRANT THAT NO ONE CAN BE DECEIVED SO FAR AS ACTUAL PERCEPTION EXTENDS THAT IS I GRANT THAT THE MIND'S IMAGINATIONS REGARDED IN THEMSELVES DO NOT INVOLVE ERROR
3227-24747-0059 MAKE ANY AFFIRMATION FOR WHAT IS THE PERCEPTION OF A WINGED HORSE SAVE AFFIRMING THAT A HORSE HAS WINGS IF THE MIND COULD PERCEIVE NOTHING ELSE BUT THE WINGED HORSE IT WOULD REGARD THE SAME AS PRESENT TO ITSELF
3227-24747-0060 IT WOULD HAVE NO REASONS FOR DOUBTING ITS EXISTENCE NOR ANY FACULTY OF DISSENT UNLESS THE IMAGINATION OF A WINGED HORSE BE JOINED TO AN IDEA WHICH PRECLUDES THE EXISTENCE OF THE SAID HORSE
3227-24747-0061 OR UNLESS THE MIND PERCEIVES THAT THE IDEA WHICH IT POSSESS OF A WINGED HORSE IS INADEQUATE IN WHICH CASE IT WILL EITHER NECESSARILY DENY THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A HORSE
3227-24747-0062 OR WILL NECESSARILY BE IN DOUBT ON THE SUBJECT I THINK THAT I HAVE ANTICIPATED MY ANSWER TO THE THIRD OBJECTION NAMELY THAT THE WILL IS SOMETHING UNIVERSAL WHICH IS PREDICATED OF ALL IDEAS
3227-24747-0063 AND THAT IT ONLY SIGNIFIES THAT WHICH IS COMMON TO ALL IDEAS NAMELY AN AFFIRMATION WHOSE ADEQUATE ESSENCE MUST THEREFORE IN SO FAR AS IT IS THUS CONCEIVED IN THE ABSTRACT
3227-24747-0064 BE IN EVERY IDEA AND BE IN THIS RESPECT ALONE THE SAME IN ALL NOT IN SO FAR AS IT IS CONSIDERED AS CONSTITUTING THE IDEA'S ESSENCE FOR IN THIS RESPECT PARTICULAR
