7424-98608-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN WE ARE HERE PRESENTED WITH AN HISTORIC RECORD OF THE REVOLT OF FIVE KINGS FROM UNDER THE HAND OF CHEDORLAOMER AND A BATTLE CONSEQUENT THEREON
7424-98608-0001 THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAN OCCUPY HIMSELF WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF KINGS AND THEIR ARMIES WHEN SUCH MOVEMENTS ARE IN ANYWISE CONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE OF GOD IN THE PRESENT CASE
7424-98608-0002 ABRAHAM PERSONALLY HAD NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE REVOLT OR ITS CONSEQUENCES HIS TENT AND ALTAR WERE NOT LIKELY TO FURNISH AN OCCASION FOR THE DECLARATION OF WAR
7424-98608-0003 THE PROPER PORTION OF A HEAVENLY MAN COULD NEVER BY ANY POSSIBILITY TEMPT THE CUPIDITY NOR EXCITE THE AMBITION OF THE KINGS AND CONQUERORS OF THIS WORLD HOWEVER ALTHOUGH ABRAHAM WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THE BATTLE OF
7424-98608-0004 FOUR KINGS WITH FIVE YET LOT WAS HIS POSITION WAS SUCH AS TO INVOLVE HIM IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR SO LONG AS WE ARE ENABLED THROUGH GRACE TO PURSUE THE PATH OF SIMPLE FAITH
7424-98608-0005 WE SHALL BE THROWN COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THIS WORLD'S CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IF WE ABANDON OUR HIGH AND HOLY POSITION AS THOSE WHOSE CITIZENSHIP IS IN HEAVEN AND SEEK A NAME A PLACE AND A PORTION IN THE EARTH
7424-98608-0006 LOT HAD TAKEN UP HIS ABODE IN THE PLAINS OF SODOM AND WAS THEREFORE DEEPLY AND SENSIBLY AFFECTED BY THE WARS OF SODOM IT MUST EVER BE THUS
7424-98608-0007 HE CAN NEVER DO SO WITHOUT SERIOUS DAMAGE TO HIS OWN SOUL AS WELL AS TO THE TESTIMONY WITH WHICH HE IS ENTRUSTED WHAT TESTIMONY WAS LOT IN SODOM A VERY FEEBLE ONE INDEED IF ONE AT ALL
7424-98608-0008 THE VERY FACT OF HIS SETTLING HIMSELF THERE WAS THE DEATH BLOW TO HIS TESTIMONY TO HAVE SPOKEN A WORD AGAINST SODOM AND ITS WAYS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CONDEMN HIMSELF FOR WHY WAS HE THERE BUT IN TRUTH
7424-98608-0009 IT DOES NOT BY ANY MEANS APPEAR THAT TO TESTIFY FOR GOD FORMED ANY PART OF HIS OBJECT IN PITCHING HIS TENT TOWARD SODOM PERSONAL AND FAMILY INTERESTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE LEADING SPRINGS OF ACTION IN HIS HEART AND THOUGH AS PETER TELLS US
7424-98608-0010 HIS RIGHTEOUS SOUL WAS VEXED WITH THE FILTHY CONVERSATION OF THE WICKED FROM DAY TO DAY YET HAD HE BUT LITTLE POWER TO ACT AGAINST IT EVEN IF INCLINED SO TO DO IT IS IMPORTANT IN A PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW
7424-98608-0011 TO SEE THAT WE CANNOT BE GOVERNED BY TWO OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME FOR EXAMPLE I CANNOT HAVE BEFORE MY MIND AS OBJECTS MY WORLDLY INTERESTS AND THE INTERESTS OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST IF I GO TO A TOWN FOR THE PURPOSE OF SETTING UP IN BUSINESS
7424-98608-0012 THEN CLEARLY BUSINESS IS MY OBJECT AND NOT THE GOSPEL I MAY NO DOUBT PROPOSE TO MYSELF BOTH TO ATTEND TO BUSINESS AND TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AS WELL BUT ALL THE WHILE EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER MUST BE MY OBJECT
7424-98608-0013 IT IS NOT THAT A SERVANT OF CHRIST MAY NOT MOST BLESSEDLY AND EFFECTUALLY PREACH THE GOSPEL AND ATTEND TO BUSINESS ALSO HE ASSUREDLY MAY BUT IN SUCH A CASE THE GOSPEL WILL BE HIS OBJECT AND NOT BUSINESS
7424-98608-0014 PAUL PREACHED THE GOSPEL AND MADE TENTS BUT THE GOSPEL WAS HIS OBJECT AND NOT TENT MAKING IF I MAKE BUSINESS MY OBJECT THE GOSPEL PREACHING WILL SPEEDILY PROVE TO BE FORMAL AND UNPROFITABLE WORK
7424-98608-0015 THE HEART IS VERY TREACHEROUS AND IT IS OFTEN TRULY ASTONISHING TO SEE HOW IT DECEIVES US WHEN WE DESIRE TO GAIN SOME SPECIAL POINT IT WILL FURNISH IN ABUNDANCE THE MOST PLAUSIBLE REASONS
7424-98608-0016 WHILE THE EYES OF OUR UNDERSTANDING ARE SO BLINDED BY SELF INTEREST OR UNJUDGED WILFULNESS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF DETECTING THEIR PLAUSIBILITY HOW FREQUENTLY DO WE HEAR PERSONS DEFENDING A CONTINUANCE IN A POSITION
7424-98608-0017 WHICH THEY ADMIT TO BE WRONG ON THE PLEA THAT THEY THEREBY ENJOY A WIDER SPHERE OF USEFULNESS TO ALL SUCH REASONING SAMUEL FURNISHES A POINTED AND POWERFUL REPLY
7424-98608-0018 TO OBEY IS BETTER THAN SACRIFICE AND TO HEARKEN THAN THE FAT OF RAMS WHICH WAS ABRAHAM OR LOT ABLE TO DO THE MORE GOOD DOES NOT THE HISTORY OF THOSE TWO MEN PROVE BEYOND A QUESTION
7424-98608-0019 THAT THE MOST EFFECTUAL WAY TO SERVE THE WORLD IS TO BE FAITHFUL TO IT BY SEPARATING FROM AND TESTIFYING AGAINST IT BUT BE IT REMEMBERED THAT GENUINE SEPARATION FROM THE WORLD CAN ONLY BE THE RESULT OF COMMUNION WITH GOD
7424-98608-0020 I MAY SECLUDE MYSELF FROM THE WORLD AND CONSTITUTE MYSELF THE CENTRE OF MY BEING LIKE A MONK OR A CYNIC BUT SEPARATION TO GOD IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING THE ONE CHILLS AND CONTRACTS THE OTHER WARMS AND EXPANDS
7424-98608-0021 THAT DRIVES US IN UPON OURSELVES THIS DRAWS US OUT IN LOVE AND INTEREST FOR OTHERS THAT MAKES SELF AND ITS INTERESTS OUR CENTRE THIS MAKES GOD AND HIS GLORY OUR CENTRE THUS IN ABRAHAM'S CASE
7424-98608-0022 WE SEE THAT THE VERY FACT OF HIS SEPARATION ENABLED HIM TO RENDER EFFECTUAL SERVICE TO ONE WHO HAD INVOLVED HIMSELF IN TROUBLE BY HIS WORLDLY WAYS WHEN ABRAHAM HEARD THAT HIS BROTHER WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE HE ARMED HIS TRAINED SERVANTS
7424-98608-0023 BORN IN HIS OWN HOUSE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN AND PURSUED THEM UNTO DAN AND HE BROUGHT BACK ALL THE GOODS AND ALSO BROUGHT AGAIN HIS BROTHER LOT AND HIS GOODS AND THE WOMEN ALSO AND THE PEOPLE LOT WAS ABRAHAM'S BROTHER AFTER ALL
7424-98608-0024 AND BROTHERLY LOVE MUST ACT A BROTHER IS BORN FOR ADVERSITY AND IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT A SEASON OF ADVERSITY SOFTENS THE HEART AND RENDERS IT SUSCEPTIBLE OF KINDNESS EVEN FROM ONE WITH WHOM WE HAVE HAD TO PART COMPANY
7424-98608-0025 AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT WHILE IN VERSE TWELVE WE READ THEY TOOK LOT ABRAHAM'S BROTHER'S SON YET IN VERSE FOURTEEN WE READ WHEN ABRAM HEARD THAT HIS BROTHER WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE THE CLAIMS OF A BROTHER'S TROUBLE ARE ANSWERED BY THE AFFECTIONS OF A BROTHER'S HEART
7424-98608-0026 THIS IS DIVINE GENUINE FAITH WHILE IT ALWAYS RENDERS US INDEPENDENT NEVER RENDERS US INDIFFERENT IT WILL NEVER WRAP ITSELF UP IN ITS FLEECE WHILE A BROTHER SHIVERS IN THE COLD
7424-98608-0027 IT PURIFIES THE HEART IT WORKS BY LOVE AND IT OVERCOMES THE WORLD AND ALL THESE RESULTS OF FAITH ARE BEAUTIFULLY EXHIBITED IN ABRAHAM ON THIS OCCASION HIS HEART WAS PURIFIED FROM SODOM'S POLLUTIONS
7424-98608-0028 HE MANIFESTED GENUINE LOVE TO LOT HIS BROTHER AND FINALLY HE WAS COMPLETELY VICTORIOUS OVER THE KINGS SUCH ARE THE PRECIOUS FRUITS OF FAITH THAT HEAVENLY CHRIST HONORING PRINCIPLE
7424-98608-0029 HOWEVER THE MAN OF FAITH IS NOT EXEMPT FROM THE ASSAULTS OF THE ENEMY AND IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER A VICTORY ONE HAS TO ENCOUNTER A FRESH TEMPTATION THUS IT WAS WITH ABRAHAM
7424-98608-0030 THE KING OF SODOM WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE SLAUGHTER OF CHEDORLAOMER AND OF THE KINGS THAT WERE WITH HIM THERE WAS EVIDENTLY A VERY DEEP AND INSIDIOUS DESIGN OF THE ENEMY IN THIS MOVEMENT THE KING OF SODOM
7424-98608-0031 PRESENTS A VERY DIFFERENT THOUGHT AND EXHIBITS A VERY DIFFERENT PHASE OF THE ENEMY'S POWER FROM WHAT WE HAVE IN CHEDORLAOMER AND THE KINGS THAT WERE WITH HIM IN THE FORMER WE HAVE RATHER THE HISS OF THE SERPENT IN THE LATTER THE ROAR OF THE LION
7424-98608-0032 BUT WHETHER IT WERE THE SERPENT OR THE LION THE LORD'S GRACE WAS AMPLY SUFFICIENT AND MOST SEASONABLY WAS THIS GRACE MINISTERED TO THE LORD'S SERVANT AT THE EXACT MOMENT OF NEED
7424-98608-0033 AND MELCHIZEDEK KING OF SALEM BROUGHT FORTH BREAD AND WINE AND HE WAS THE PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH GOD AND HE BLESSED HIM AND SAID
7424-98608-0034 AND BLESSED BE THE MOST HIGH GOD WHICH HATH DELIVERED THINE ENEMIES INTO THY HAND WE HAVE HERE TO REMARK FIRST THE PECULIAR POINT AT WHICH MELCHIZEDEK ENTERS THE SCENE AND SECONDLY THE DOUBLE EFFECT OF HIS MINISTRY
7424-98608-0035 HE DID NOT COME FORTH WHEN ABRAHAM WAS IN PURSUIT OF CHEDORLAOMER BUT WHEN THE KING OF SODOM WAS IN PURSUIT OF ABRAHAM THIS MAKES A GREAT MORAL DIFFERENCE A DEEPER CHARACTER OF COMMUNION WAS NEEDED TO MEET THE DEEPER CHARACTER OF CONFLICT
7424-98608-0036 AND THEN AS TO THE MINISTRY THE BREAD AND WINE REFRESHED ABRAHAM'S SPIRIT AFTER HIS CONFLICT WITH CHEDORLAOMER WHILE THE BENEDICTION PREPARED HIS HEART FOR HIS CONFLICT WITH THE KING OF SODOM ABRAHAM WAS A CONQUEROR
7424-98608-0037 AND YET HE WAS ABOUT TO BE A COMBATANT AND THE ROYAL PRIEST REFRESHED THE CONQUEROR'S SPIRIT AND FORTIFIED THE COMBATANT'S HEART IT IS PECULIARLY SWEET TO OBSERVE THE MANNER IN WHICH MELCHIZEDEK INTRODUCES GOD TO THE THOUGHTS OF ABRAHAM
7424-98608-0038 HE CALLS HIM THE MOST HIGH GOD
7424-98608-0039 AND NOT ONLY SO BUT PRONOUNCES ABRAHAM BLESSED OF THAT SAME GOD THIS WAS EFFECTUALLY PREPARING HIM FOR THE KING OF SODOM A MAN WHO WAS BLESSED OF GOD DID NOT NEED TO TAKE AUGHT FROM THE ENEMY
7424-98608-0040 AND IF THE POSSESSOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH FILLED HIS VISION THE GOODS OF SODOM COULD HAVE BUT LITTLE ATTRACTION HENCE AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WHEN THE KING OF SODOM MADE HIS PROPOSAL GIVE ME THE PERSONS AND TAKE THE GOODS TO THYSELF
7424-98608-0041 ABRAHAM REPLIES I HAVE LIFT UP MY HAND UNTO THE LORD THE MOST HIGH GOD THE POSSESSOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THAT I WILL NOT TAKE FROM A THREAD EVEN TO A SHOELATCHET AND THAT I WILL NOT TAKE ANY THING THAT IS THINE LEST THOU SHOULDEST SAY
7424-98608-0042 ABRAHAM REFUSES TO BE ENRICHED BY THE KING OF SODOM HOW COULD HE THINK OF DELIVERING LOT FROM THE POWER OF THE WORLD IF HE HIMSELF WERE GOVERNED THEREBY THE ONLY TRUE WAY IN WHICH TO DELIVER ANOTHER
7424-98608-0043 IS TO BE THOROUGHLY DELIVERED MYSELF SO LONG AS I AM IN THE FIRE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE I CAN PLUCK ANOTHER OUT OF IT THE PATH OF SEPARATION IS THE PATH OF POWER AS IT IS ALSO THE PATH OF PEACE AND BLESSEDNESS
7424-98608-0044 THE WORLD IN ALL ITS VARIOUS FORMS IS THE GREAT INSTRUMENT OF WHICH SATAN MAKES USE IN ORDER TO WEAKEN THE HANDS AND ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE SERVANTS OF CHRIST BUT BLESSED BE GOD WHEN THE HEART IS TRUE TO HIM
7424-98608-0045 HE ALWAYS COMES IN TO CHEER TO STRENGTHEN AND TO FORTIFY AT THE RIGHT TIME THE EYES OF THE LORD RUN TO AND FRO THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH TO SHOW HIMSELF STRONG IN THE BEHALF OF THEM WHOSE HEART IS PERFECT TOWARD HIM
7424-98608-0046 AND OUR FINGERS TO FIGHT AND FINALLY HE WILL BRUISE SATAN UNDER OUR FEET SHORTLY ALL THIS IS UNSPEAKABLY COMFORTING TO A HEART SINCERELY DESIROUS OF MAKING WAY AGAINST THE WORLD THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL
