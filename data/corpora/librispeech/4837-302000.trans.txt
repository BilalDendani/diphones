4837-302000-0011 AND THIS WITH THE RICH VELVETS SHE AFFECTED AMPLE AND LONG MADE HER LOOK LIKE A FRENCH MARQUISE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY STEPPED DOWN FROM THE CANVAS THE EFFECT WAS BY NO MEANS ACCIDENTAL
4837-302000-0012 MISSUS MC LANE'S GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN FRENCH AND SHE RESEMBLED HER HER HOOPSKIRT WAS SMALL BUT THE OTHER WOMEN WERE INCLINED TO THE EXTREME OF THE FASHION
4837-302000-0013 THEY OR THEIR DRESSMAKERS SUBSCRIBED TO THEIR HANDSOME GOWNS SPREAD WIDELY AND THE ROOMS HARDLY COULD HAVE SEEMED TO SWAY AND UNDULATE MORE IF AN EARTHQUAKE HAD ROCKED IT

4837-302000-0015 THE HUSBANDS HAD RETIRED WITH MISTER MC LANE TO THE SMOKING ROOM
4837-302000-0016 UNLIKE AS A RECEPTION OF THAT DAY WAS IN BACKGROUND AND COSTUMES FROM THE REFINEMENTS OF MODERN ART AND TASTE IT POSSESSED ONE CONTRAST THAT WAS WHOLLY TO ITS ADVANTAGE
4837-302000-0017 ITS MEN WERE GENTLEMEN AND THE SONS AND GRANDSONS OF GENTLEMEN
4837-302000-0018 AMBITIOUS TO PUSH AHEAD IN POLITICS OR THE PROFESSIONS AND APPRECIATING THE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE NEW AND FAMOUS CITY OR LEFT WITH AN INSUFFICIENT INHERITANCE PARTICULARLY AFTER THE WAR
4837-302000-0019 AND ASHAMED TO WORK IN COMMUNITIES WHERE NO GENTLEMAN HAD EVER WORKED
4837-302000-0020 IF HE DID NOT OCCUPY HIMSELF LUCRATIVELY WAS UNFIT FOR THE SOCIETY OF ENTERPRISING CITIZENS FEW HAD COME IN TIME FOR THE GOLD DIGGINGS BUT ALL

4837-302000-0022 IF THEY TOOK UP LESS ROOM THAN THE WOMEN THEY CERTAINLY WERE MORE DECORATIVE DOCTOR TALBOT AND HIS WIFE HAD NOT ARRIVED TO ALL EAGER QUESTIONS MISSUS MC LANE MERELY REPLIED THAT THEY WOULD
4837-302000-0023 BE HERE SHE HAD THE DRAMATIC INSTINCT OF THE TRUE LEADER AND HAD COMMANDED THE DOCTOR NOT TO BRING HIS BRIDE BEFORE FOUR O'CLOCK THE RECEPTION BEGAN AT THREE THEY SHOULD HAVE AN ENTRANCE
4837-302000-0024 BUT MISSUS ABBOTT A LADY OF THREE CHINS AND AN EAGLE EYE WHO HAD CLUNG FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO BLACK SATIN AND BUGLES WAS TOO PERSISTENT TO BE DENIED
4837-302000-0025 SHE EXTRACTED THE INFORMATION THAT THE BOSTONIAN HAD SENT HER OWN FURNITURE BY A PREVIOUS STEAMER AND THAT HER DRAWING ROOM WAS GRACEFUL FRENCH AND EXQUISITE
4837-302000-0026 AT TEN MINUTES AFTER THE HOUR THE BUZZ AND CHATTER STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND EVERY FACE WAS TURNED EVERY NECK CRANED TOWARD THE DOOR THE COLORED BUTLER HAD ANNOUNCED WITH A GRAND FLOURISH
4837-302000-0027 DOCTOR AND MISSUS TALBOT THE DOCTOR LOOKED AS RUBICUND AS JOVIAL AS CYNICAL AS EVER BUT FEW CAST HIM MORE THAN A PASSING GLANCE THEN THEY GAVE AN AUDIBLE GASP
4837-302000-0028 INDUCED BY AN INGENUOUS COMPOUND OF AMAZEMENT DISAPPOINTMENT AND ADMIRATION THEY HAD BEEN PREPARED TO FORGIVE TO ENDURE TO MAKE EVERY ALLOWANCE
4837-302000-0029 THE POOR THING COULD NO MORE HELP BEING PLAIN AND DOWDY THAN BORN IN BOSTON AND AS THEIR LEADER HAD SATISFIED HERSELF THAT SHE WOULD DO THEY WOULD NEVER LET HER KNOW HOW DEEPLY THEY DEPLORED HER DISABILITIES
4837-302000-0030 BUT THEY FOUND NOTHING TO DEPLORE BUT THE AGONIZING NECESSITY FOR IMMEDIATE READJUSTMENT MISSUS TALBOT WAS UNQUESTIONABLY A PRODUCT OF THE BEST SOCIETY THE SOUTH COULD HAVE DONE NO BETTER

4837-302000-0032 CLASPED AT THE BASE BY A STRING OF PEARLS ON HER HEAD AS PROUDLY POISED AS MISSUS MC LANE'S WAS A BLUE VELVET HAT HIGHER IN THE CROWN THAN THE PREVAILING FASHION
4837-302000-0033 ROLLED UP ON ONE SIDE AND TRIMMED ONLY WITH A DROOPING GRAY FEATHER AND HER FIGURE HER FACE HER PROFILE THE YOUNG MEN CROWDED FORWARD MORE SWIFTLY THAN THE STILL ALMOST PARALYZED WOMEN

4837-302000-0036 AS SHE MOVED FORWARD AND STOOD IN FRONT OF MISSUS MC LANE OR ACKNOWLEDGED INTRODUCTIONS TO THOSE THAT STOOD NEAR THE WOMEN GAVE ANOTHER GASP THIS TIME OF CONSTERNATION
4837-302000-0037 SHE WORE NEITHER HOOP SKIRT NOR CRINOLINE COULD IT BE THAT THE MOST ELEGANT FASHION EVER INVENTED HAD BEEN DISCARDED BY PARIS OR WAS THIS LOVELY CREATURE OF SURPASSING ELEGANCE A LAW UNTO HERSELF
4837-302000-0038 HER SKIRT WAS FULL BUT STRAIGHT AND DID NOT DISGUISE THE LINES OF HER GRACEFUL FIGURE ABOVE HER SMALL WAIST IT FITTED AS CLOSELY AS A RIDING HABIT SHE WAS EVEN MORE BECOMINGLY
4837-302000-0039 DRESSED THAN ANY WOMAN IN THE ROOM MISSUS ABBOTT WHO WAS GIVEN TO PRIMITIVE SOUNDS SNORTED MARIA BALLINGER WHOSE FINELY DEVELOPED FIGURE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN THE TRUNK OF A TREE SNIFFED

4837-302000-0043 SHE WAS SWEET AND GRACIOUS BUT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT A HINT OF EMBARRASSMENT SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SHINE AND THEY LIKED HER THE BETTER FOR THAT THE YOUNG MEN SOON DISCOVERED THEY COULD MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON THIS LOVELY IMPORTATION
4837-302000-0044 FOR HER EYES STRAYED CONSTANTLY TO HER HUSBAND UNTIL HE DISAPPEARED IN SEARCH OF CRONIES WHISKEY AND A CIGAR THEN SHE LOOKED DEPRESSED FOR A MOMENT BUT GAVE A STILL CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE WOMEN ABOUT HER
4837-302000-0045 IN LOVE WITH HER HUSBAND BUT A WOMAN OF THE WORLD MANNERS AS FINE AS MISSUS MC LANE'S BUT TOO ALOOF AND SENSITIVE TO CARE FOR LEADERSHIP SHE HAD MADE THE GRAND TOUR IN EUROPE THEY DISCOVERED
4837-302000-0046 AND ENJOYED A SEASON IN WASHINGTON SHE SHOULD CONTINUE TO LIVE AT THE OCCIDENTAL HOTEL AS HER HUSBAND WOULD BE OUT SO MUCH AT NIGHT AND SHE WAS RATHER TIMID AND SHE WAS BRIGHT UNAFFECTED RESPONSIVE
