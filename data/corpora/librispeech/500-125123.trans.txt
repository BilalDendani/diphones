500-125123-0014 AND HE SAYS HE DOES KNOW HIM AND PODSNAP RECIPROCATES APPARENTLY PODSNAP HAS BEEN SO WROUGHT UPON IN A SHORT TIME AS TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS BEEN INTIMATE IN THE HOUSE MANY MANY MANY YEARS
500-125123-0015 IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER HE IS MAKING HIMSELF QUITE AT HOME WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE EXECUTING A STATUETTE OF THE COLOSSUS AT RHODES TWEMLOW HAS BEFORE NOTICED IN HIS FEEBLE WAY HOW SOON THE VENEERING GUESTS BECOME INFECTED WITH THE VENEERING FICTION
500-125123-0016 NOT HOWEVER THAT HE HAS THE LEAST NOTION OF ITS BEING HIS OWN CASE OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA PURSUES VENEERING THE VEILED PROPHET OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA
500-125123-0017 YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR MY DEAR FELLOWS ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED AS MY WIFE AND I MAKE IT A FAMILY AFFAIR THE ENTIRE DIRECTION OF WHICH WE TAKE UPON OURSELVES OF COURSE OUR FIRST STEP IS TO COMMUNICATE THE FACT TO OUR FAMILY FRIENDS
500-125123-0018 OH THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES ON PODSNAP THEN THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF US AND HE'S THE OTHER I DID HOPE VENEERING GOES ON TO HAVE HAD LADY TIPPINS TO MEET YOU
500-125123-0019 OH THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES WANDERING THEN THERE ARE THREE OF US AND SHE'S THE OTHER MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD RESUMES VENEERING WHOM YOU BOTH KNOW IS OUT OF TOWN BUT HE WRITES IN HIS WHIMSICAL MANNER
500-125123-0020 BOOTS AND BREWER OBSERVES VENEERING WHOM YOU ALSO KNOW I HAVE NOT ASKED TO DAY BUT I RESERVE THEM FOR THE OCCASION THEN THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES SHUT
500-125123-0021 BUT HERE COLLAPSES AND DOES NOT COMPLETELY RECOVER UNTIL DINNER IS OVER AND THE ANALYTICAL HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO WITHDRAW WE NOW COME SAYS VENEERING TO THE POINT THE REAL POINT OF OUR LITTLE FAMILY CONSULTATION SOPHRONIA
500-125123-0022 BECAUSE I COULDN'T TAKE SO MUCH UPON MYSELF WHEN I HAVE RESPECTED FAMILY FRIENDS TO REMEMBER SECONDLY
500-125123-0023 AND FEELS AVERSE TO MY GIVING AWAY ANYBODY UNTIL BABY IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE MARRIED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE DID PODSNAP INQUIRES OF MISSUS VENEERING MY DEAR MISTER PODSNAP IT'S VERY FOOLISH I KNOW BUT I HAVE AN INSTINCTIVE PRESENTIMENT THAT IF HAMILTON
500-125123-0024 GAVE AWAY ANYBODY ELSE FIRST HE WOULD NEVER GIVE AWAY BABY THUS MISSUS VENEERING WITH HER OPEN HANDS PRESSED TOGETHER AND EACH OF HER EIGHT AQUILINE FINGERS LOOKING SO VERY LIKE HER ONE AQUILINE NOSE THAT THE BRAN NEW JEWELS ON THEM SEEM NECESSARY FOR DISTINCTION'S SAKE
500-125123-0025 BUT MY DEAR PODSNAP QUOTH VENEERING THERE IS A TRIED FRIEND OF OUR FAMILY WHO I THINK AND HOPE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME PODSNAP IS THE FRIEND ON WHOM THIS AGREEABLE DUTY ALMOST NATURALLY DEVOLVES THAT FRIEND
500-125123-0026 IS NOW AMONG US THAT FRIEND IS TWEMLOW CERTAINLY FROM PODSNAP THAT FRIEND VENEERING REPEATS WITH GREATER FIRMNESS IS OUR DEAR GOOD TWEMLOW
500-125123-0027 AND I CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESS TO YOU MY DEAR PODSNAP THE PLEASURE I FEEL IN HAVING THIS OPINION OF MINE AND ANASTATIA'S SO READILY CONFIRMED BY YOU THAT OTHER EQUALLY FAMILIAR AND TRIED FRIEND WHO STANDS IN THE PROUD POSITION
500-125123-0028 OR I OUGHT RATHER TO SAY
500-125123-0029 OF BABY'S GODFATHER AND INDEED VENEERING IS MUCH RELIEVED IN MIND TO FIND THAT PODSNAP BETRAYS NO JEALOUSY OF TWEMLOW'S ELEVATION SO IT HAS COME TO PASS THAT THE SPRING VAN IS STREWING FLOWERS ON THE ROSY HOURS AND ON THE STAIRCASE
500-125123-0030 AND WHOSE LEFT HAND APPEARS TO BE IN A STATE OF ACUTE RHEUMATISM BUT IS IN FACT VOLUNTARILY DOUBLED UP TO ACT AS A MONEY BOX AND NOW VENEERING SHOOTS OUT OF THE STUDY WHEREIN HE IS ACCUSTOMED WHEN CONTEMPLATIVE
500-125123-0031 TO GIVE HIS MIND TO THE CARVING AND GILDING OF THE PILGRIMS GOING TO CANTERBURY IN ORDER TO SHOW TWEMLOW THE LITTLE FLOURISH HE HAS PREPARED FOR THE TRUMPETS OF FASHION DESCRIBING HOW THAT ON THE SEVENTEENTH INSTANT AT SAINT JAMES'S CHURCH THE REVEREND BLANK BLANK ASSISTED BY THE REVEREND DASH DASH
500-125123-0032 UNITED IN THE BONDS OF MATRIMONY ALFRED LAMMLE ESQUIRE OF SACKVILLE STREET PICCADILLY TO SOPHRONIA ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE LATE HORATIO AKERSHEM ESQUIRE OF YORKSHIRE ALSO HOW THE FAIR BRIDE WAS MARRIED FROM THE HOUSE OF HAMILTON VENEERING
500-125123-0033 ESQUIRE OF STUCCONIA AND WAS GIVEN AWAY BY MELVIN TWEMLOW ESQUIRE OF DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S SECOND COUSIN TO LORD SNIGSWORTH OF SNIGSWORTHY PARK WHILE PERUSING WHICH COMPOSITION TWEMLOW MAKES SOME OPAQUE APPROACH TO PERCEIVING
500-125123-0034 THAT IF THE REVEREND BLANK BLANK AND THE REVEREND DASH DASH FAIL AFTER THIS INTRODUCTION TO BECOME ENROLLED IN THE LIST OF VENEERING'S DEAREST AND OLDEST FRIENDS THEY WILL HAVE NONE BUT THEMSELVES TO THANK FOR IT AFTER WHICH APPEARS SOPHRONIA
500-125123-0035 AND AFTER HER APPEARS ALFRED WHOM TWEMLOW HAS SEEN ONCE IN HIS LIFETIME TO DO THE SAME AND TO MAKE A PASTY SORT OF GLITTER AS IF HE WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR CANDLE LIGHT ONLY AND HAD BEEN LET OUT INTO DAYLIGHT BY SOME GRAND MISTAKE AND AFTER THAT COMES MISSUS VENEERING
500-125123-0036 WORN OUT BY WORRY AND EXCITEMENT AS SHE TELLS HER DEAR MISTER TWEMLOW
500-125123-0037 AND TO COME LIKE ADORABLE RECRUITS ENLISTED BY A SERGEANT NOT PRESENT FOR ON ARRIVING AT THE VENEERING DEPOT THEY ARE IN A BARRACK OF STRANGERS SO TWEMLOW GOES HOME TO DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S TO TAKE A PLATE OF MUTTON BROTH WITH A CHOP IN IT
500-125123-0038 AND A LOOK AT THE MARRIAGE SERVICE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY CUT IN AT THE RIGHT PLACE TO MORROW AND HE IS LOW AND FEELS IT DULL OVER THE LIVERY STABLE YARD AND IS DISTINCTLY AWARE OF A DINT IN HIS HEART MADE BY THE MOST ADORABLE OF THE ADORABLE BRIDESMAIDS
500-125123-0039 FOR THE POOR LITTLE HARMLESS GENTLEMAN ONCE HAD HIS FANCY LIKE THE REST OF US AND SHE DIDN'T ANSWER AS SHE OFTEN DOES NOT AND HE THINKS THE ADORABLE BRIDESMAID IS LIKE THE FANCY AS SHE WAS THEN WHICH SHE IS NOT AT ALL
500-125123-0040 AND THAT IF THE FANCY HAD NOT MARRIED SOME ONE ELSE FOR MONEY BUT HAD MARRIED HIM FOR LOVE HE AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY WHICH THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AND THAT SHE HAS A TENDERNESS FOR HIM STILL WHEREAS HER TOUGHNESS IS A PROVERB
500-125123-0041 BROODING OVER THE FIRE WITH HIS DRIED LITTLE HEAD IN HIS DRIED LITTLE HANDS AND HIS DRIED LITTLE ELBOWS ON HIS DRIED LITTLE KNEES TWEMLOW IS MELANCHOLY NO ADORABLE TO BEAR ME COMPANY HERE THINKS HE NO ADORABLE AT THE CLUB
500-125123-0042 A WASTE A WASTE A WASTE MY TWEMLOW
500-125123-0043 BETIMES NEXT MORNING THAT HORRIBLE OLD LADY TIPPINS
500-125123-0044 WHO WHILE PERFORMING THE CEREMONY WAS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO OBSERVE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHO WHO WHO WHY WHY WHY BEGINS TO BE DYED AND VARNISHED FOR THE INTERESTING OCCASION
500-125123-0045 SHE HAS A REPUTATION FOR GIVING SMART ACCOUNTS OF THINGS AND SHE MUST BE AT THESE PEOPLE'S EARLY MY DEAR TO LOSE NOTHING OF THE FUN WHEREABOUT IN THE BONNET AND DRAPERY ANNOUNCED BY HER NAME ANY FRAGMENT OF THE REAL WOMAN MAY BE CONCEALED
500-125123-0046 IS PERHAPS KNOWN TO HER MAID BUT YOU COULD EASILY BUY ALL YOU SEE OF HER IN BOND STREET OR YOU MIGHT SCALP HER AND PEEL HER AND SCRAPE HER AND MAKE TWO LADY TIPPINSES OUT OF HER AND YET NOT PENETRATE TO THE GENUINE ARTICLE
500-125123-0047 SHE HAS A LARGE GOLD EYE GLASS HAS LADY TIPPINS TO SURVEY THE PROCEEDINGS WITH IF SHE HAD ONE IN EACH EYE IT MIGHT KEEP THAT OTHER DROOPING LID UP AND LOOK MORE UNIFORM BUT PERENNIAL YOUTH IS IN HER ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS AND HER LIST OF LOVERS IS FULL
500-125123-0048 MORTIMER YOU WRETCH SAYS LADY TIPPINS TURNING THE EYEGLASS ABOUT AND ABOUT WHERE IS YOUR CHARGE THE BRIDEGROOM
500-125123-0049 MISERABLE IS THAT THE WAY YOU DO YOUR DUTY BEYOND AN IMPRESSION THAT HE IS TO SIT UPON MY KNEE AND BE SECONDED AT SOME POINT OF THE SOLEMNITIES
500-125123-0050 RETURNS MORTIMER EUGENE IS ALSO IN ATTENDANCE WITH A PERVADING AIR UPON HIM OF HAVING PRESUPPOSED THE CEREMONY TO BE A FUNERAL AND OF BEING DISAPPOINTED
500-125123-0051 AND AN UNACKNOWLEDGED MEMBER OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY WHOM LADY TIPPINS SURVEYING THROUGH HER EYE GLASS CONSIDERS A FINE MAN AND QUITE A CATCH
500-125123-0052 THIRTY SHILLINGS A YARD VEIL FIFTEEN POUND POCKET HANDKERCHIEF A PRESENT BRIDESMAIDS
500-125123-0053 VENEERING'S FLOWERS SNUB NOSED ONE RATHER PRETTY BUT TOO CONSCIOUS OF HER STOCKINGS BONNETS THREE POUND TEN
500-125123-0054 VENEERING'S HOUSE REACHED DRAWING ROOMS MOST MAGNIFICENT HERE THE PODSNAPS AWAIT THE HAPPY PARTY MISTER PODSNAP WITH HIS HAIR BRUSHES MADE THE MOST OF THAT IMPERIAL ROCKING HORSE MISSUS PODSNAP MAJESTICALLY SKITTISH HERE TOO ARE BOOTS AND BREWER
500-125123-0055 AND THE TWO OTHER BUFFERS EACH BUFFER WITH A FLOWER IN HIS BUTTON HOLE HIS HAIR CURLED AND HIS GLOVES BUTTONED ON TIGHT APPARENTLY COME PREPARED
500-125123-0056 AN OILCAKE FED STYLE OF BUSINESS GENTLEMAN WITH MOONEY SPECTACLES AND AN OBJECT OF MUCH INTEREST
500-125123-0057 WHICH MAKES SEVEN TWEMLOW THOUGHT AND CONFIDENTIALLY RETIRING WITH HIM INTO THE CONSERVATORY IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT VENEERING IS HIS CO TRUSTEE AND THAT THEY ARE ARRANGING ABOUT THE FORTUNE BUFFERS ARE EVEN OVERHEARD TO WHISPER
500-125123-0058 WITH A SMACK AND A RELISH
500-125123-0059 POKEY UNKNOWNS AMAZED TO FIND HOW INTIMATELY THEY KNOW VENEERING PLUCK UP SPIRIT FOLD THEIR ARMS AND BEGIN TO CONTRADICT HIM BEFORE BREAKFAST WHAT TIME MISSUS VENEERING CARRYING BABY DRESSED AS A BRIDESMAID FLITS ABOUT AMONG THE COMPANY
500-125123-0060 EMITTING FLASHES OF MANY COLOURED LIGHTNING FROM DIAMONDS EMERALDS AND RUBIES THE ANALYTICAL IN COURSE OF TIME ACHIEVING WHAT HE FEELS TO BE DUE TO HIMSELF IN BRINGING TO A DIGNIFIED CONCLUSION SEVERAL QUARRELS HE HAS ON HAND WITH THE PASTRYCOOK'S MEN
500-125123-0061 ANNOUNCES BREAKFAST DINING ROOM NO LESS MAGNIFICENT THAN DRAWING ROOM TABLES SUPERB ALL THE CAMELS OUT AND ALL LADEN SPLENDID CAKE COVERED WITH CUPIDS SILVER AND TRUE LOVERS KNOTS
500-125123-0062 SPLENDID BRACELET PRODUCED BY VENEERING BEFORE GOING DOWN AND CLASPED UPON THE ARM OF BRIDE YET NOBODY SEEMS TO THINK MUCH MORE OF THE VENEERINGS THAN IF THEY WERE A TOLERABLE LANDLORD AND LANDLADY DOING THE THING IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS AT SO MUCH A HEAD
500-125123-0063 THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM TALK AND LAUGH APART AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEIR MANNER AND THE BUFFERS WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DISHES WITH SYSTEMATIC PERSEVERANCE
500-125123-0064 ANOTHER DISMAL CIRCUMSTANCE IS THAT VENEERING HAVING THE CAPTIVATING TIPPINS ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE BRIDE'S AUNT ON THE OTHER FINDS IT IMMENSELY DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE PEACE FOR MEDUSA
500-125123-0065 FOLLOWS EVERY LIVELY REMARK MADE BY THAT DEAR CREATURE WITH AN AUDIBLE SNORT WHICH MAY BE REFERABLE TO A CHRONIC COLD IN THE HEAD BUT MAY ALSO BE REFERABLE TO INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT
500-125123-0066 AT LENGTH COMES TO BE EXPECTED BY THE COMPANY WHO MAKE EMBARRASSING PAUSES WHEN IT IS FALLING DUE AND BY WAITING FOR IT RENDER IT MORE EMPHATIC WHEN IT COMES THE STONEY AUNT HAS LIKEWISE AN INJURIOUS WAY OF REJECTING ALL DISHES WHEREOF LADY TIPPINS PARTAKES
500-125123-0067 SAYING ALOUD WHEN THEY ARE PROFFERED TO HER NO NO NO NOT FOR ME TAKE IT AWAY AS WITH A SET PURPOSE OF IMPLYING A MISGIVING THAT IF NOURISHED UPON SIMILAR MEATS SHE MIGHT COME TO BE LIKE THAT CHARMER WHICH WOULD BE A FATAL CONSUMMATION
500-125123-0068 AWARE OF HER ENEMY LADY TIPPINS TRIES A YOUTHFUL SALLY OR TWO AND TRIES THE EYE GLASS BUT FROM THE IMPENETRABLE CAP AND SNORTING ARMOUR OF THE STONEY AUNT ALL WEAPONS REBOUND POWERLESS ANOTHER OBJECTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS
500-125123-0069 THAT THE POKEY UNKNOWNS SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN BEING UNIMPRESSIBLE THEY PERSIST IN NOT BEING FRIGHTENED BY THE GOLD AND SILVER CAMELS AND THEY ARE BANDED TOGETHER TO DEFY THE ELABORATELY CHASED ICE PAILS THEY EVEN SEEM TO UNITE IN SOME VAGUE UTTERANCE OF THE SENTIMENT
500-125123-0070 THOSE LOVELY BEINGS BECOME EACH ONE OF HER OWN ACCOUNT DEPRECIATINGLY CONTEMPLATIVE OF THE MILLINERY PRESENT WHILE THE BRIDEGROOM'S MAN EXHAUSTED IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR APPEARS TO BE IMPROVING THE OCCASION BY PENITENTIALLY CONTEMPLATING ALL THE WRONG HE HAS EVER DONE
500-125123-0071 THAT THE LATTER IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR APPEARS TO BE CONTEMPLATING ALL THE WRONG HE WOULD LIKE TO DO PARTICULARLY TO THE PRESENT COMPANY IN WHICH STATE OF AFFAIRS THE USUAL CEREMONIES RATHER DROOP AND FLAG AND THE SPLENDID CAKE WHEN CUT BY THE FAIR HAND OF THE BRIDE
500-125123-0072 HAS BUT AN INDIGESTIBLE APPEARANCE HOWEVER ALL THE THINGS INDISPENSABLE TO BE SAID ARE SAID
500-125123-0073 INCLUDING LADY TIPPINS'S YAWNING FALLING ASLEEP AND WAKING INSENSIBLE AND THERE IS HURRIED PREPARATION FOR THE NUPTIAL JOURNEY TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND THE OUTER AIR TEEMS WITH BRASS BANDS AND SPECTATORS
500-125123-0074 THE MALIGNANT STAR OF THE ANALYTICAL HAS PRE ORDAINED THAT PAIN AND RIDICULE SHALL BEFALL HIM FOR HE STANDING ON THE DOORSTEPS TO GRACE THE DEPARTURE IS SUDDENLY CAUGHT
500-125123-0075 WITH A HEAVY SHOE WHICH A BUFFER IN THE HALL CHAMPAGNE FLUSHED AND WILD OF AIM HAS BORROWED ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT FROM THE PASTRYCOOK'S PORTER TO CAST AFTER THE DEPARTING PAIR AS AN AUSPICIOUS OMEN SO THEY ALL GO UP AGAIN INTO THE GORGEOUS DRAWING ROOMS
500-125123-0076 ALL OF THEM FLUSHED WITH BREAKFAST AS HAVING TAKEN SCARLATINA SOCIABLY
500-125123-0077 AND TAKE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OUT OF THE SPLENDID FURNITURE AND SO LADY TIPPINS
500-125123-0078 AND EVEN THE UNKNOWNS ARE SLOWLY STRAINED OFF AND IT IS ALL OVER ALL OVER THAT IS TO SAY FOR THE TIME BEING BUT THERE IS ANOTHER TIME TO COME AND IT COMES IN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AND IT COMES TO MISTER AND MISSUS LAMMLE
500-125123-0079 ON THE SANDS AT SHANKLIN IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT MISTER AND MISSUS LAMMLE HAVE WALKED FOR SOME TIME ON THE SHANKLIN SANDS AND ONE MAY SEE BY THEIR FOOTPRINTS THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED ARM IN ARM AND THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED IN A STRAIGHT TRACK
500-125123-0080 AND THAT THEY HAVE WALKED IN A MOODY HUMOUR FOR THE LADY HAS PRODDED LITTLE SPIRTING HOLES IN THE DAMP SAND BEFORE HER WITH HER PARASOL AND THE GENTLEMAN HAS TRAILED HIS STICK AFTER HIM
500-125123-0081 DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THEN SOPHRONIA
500-125123-0082 AND TURNS UPON HIM DON'T PUT IT UPON ME SIR I ASK YOU DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME MISTER LAMMLE FALLS SILENT AGAIN AND THEY WALK AS BEFORE MISSUS LAMMLE OPENS HER NOSTRILS AND BITES HER UNDER LIP
500-125123-0083 MISTER LAMMLE TAKES HIS GINGEROUS WHISKERS IN HIS LEFT HAND AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER FROWNS FURTIVELY AT HIS BELOVED OUT OF A THICK GINGEROUS BUSH DO I MEAN TO SAY
500-125123-0084 PUTTING IT ON ME THE UNMANLY DISINGENUOUSNESS MISTER LAMMLE STOPS RELEASES HIS WHISKERS AND LOOKS AT HER THE WHAT MISSUS LAMMLE HAUGHTILY REPLIES WITHOUT STOPPING AND WITHOUT LOOKING BACK THE MEANNESS
500-125123-0085 HE IS AT HER SIDE AGAIN IN A PACE OR TWO AND HE RETORTS THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU SAID YOU SAID DISINGENUOUSNESS WHAT IF I DID THERE IS NO IF IN THE CASE YOU DID I DID THEN AND WHAT OF IT
500-125123-0086 WHAT OF IT SAYS MISTER LAMMLE HAVE YOU THE FACE TO UTTER THE WORD TO ME THE FACE TOO REPLIED MISSUS LAMMLE STARING AT HIM WITH COLD SCORN PRAY HOW DARE YOU SIR UTTER THE WORD TO ME I NEVER DID
500-125123-0087 AS THIS HAPPENS TO BE TRUE MISSUS LAMMLE IS THROWN ON THE FEMININE RESOURCE OF SAYING I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU UTTERED OR DID NOT UTTER
500-125123-0088 AND A LITTLE MORE SILENCE MISTER LAMMLE BREAKS THE LATTER YOU SHALL PROCEED IN YOUR OWN WAY
500-125123-0089 DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT YOU ARE A MAN OF PROPERTY NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES SO BE IT NEXT COMES WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY
500-125123-0090 NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES IF YOU WERE SO DULL A FORTUNE HUNTER THAT YOU DECEIVED YOURSELF OR IF YOU WERE SO GREEDY AND GRASPING THAT YOU WERE OVER WILLING TO BE DECEIVED BY APPEARANCES IS IT MY FAULT YOU ADVENTURER THE LADY DEMANDS WITH GREAT ASPERITY
500-125123-0091 VENEERING WITH GREAT CONTEMPT AND WHAT DOES VENEERING KNOW ABOUT ME WAS HE NOT YOUR TRUSTEE NO I HAVE NO TRUSTEE BUT THE ONE YOU SAW ON THE DAY WHEN YOU FRAUDULENTLY MARRIED ME
500-125123-0092 AND HIS TRUST IS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT ONE FOR IT IS ONLY AN ANNUITY OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN POUNDS I THINK THERE ARE SOME ODD SHILLINGS OR PENCE IF YOU ARE VERY PARTICULAR MISTER LAMMLE BESTOWS A BY NO MEANS LOVING LOOK UPON THE PARTNER OF HIS JOYS AND SORROWS
500-125123-0093 AND HE MUTTERS SOMETHING BUT CHECKS HIMSELF QUESTION FOR QUESTION IT IS MY TURN AGAIN MISSUS LAMMLE WHAT MADE YOU SUPPOSE ME A MAN OF PROPERTY YOU MADE ME SUPPOSE YOU SO
500-125123-0094 BUT YOU ASKED SOMEBODY TOO COME MISSUS LAMMLE ADMISSION FOR ADMISSION YOU ASKED SOMEBODY

500-125123-0101 YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS WITH IT WHEREUPON SHE CALLS HIM IN HER RAGE A DELIBERATE VILLAIN AND SO CASTS THE BROKEN THING FROM HER AS THAT IT STRIKES HIM IN FALLING THE FINGER MARKS ARE SOMETHING WHITER FOR THE INSTANT BUT HE WALKS ON AT HER SIDE
500-125123-0102 SHE BURSTS INTO TEARS DECLARING HERSELF THE WRETCHEDEST THE MOST DECEIVED THE WORST USED OF WOMEN THEN SHE SAYS THAT IF SHE HAD THE COURAGE TO KILL HERSELF SHE WOULD DO IT THEN SHE CALLS HIM VILE IMPOSTOR
