3869-700-0000 I AM GOING UPSTAIRS TO MY ROOM NOT IN TO YOU GOOD BY AND PASSED BY TRYING NOT EVEN TO LOOK AT HIS FATHER VERY POSSIBLY THE OLD MAN WAS TOO HATEFUL TO HIM AT THAT MOMENT BUT SUCH AN UNCEREMONIOUS DISPLAY OF HOSTILITY
3869-700-0001 WAS A SURPRISE EVEN TO FYODOR PAVLOVITCH AND THE OLD MAN EVIDENTLY WANTED TO TELL HIM SOMETHING AT ONCE AND HAD COME TO MEET HIM IN THE DRAWING ROOM ON PURPOSE RECEIVING THIS AMIABLE GREETING HE STOOD STILL IN SILENCE
3869-700-0002 AND WITH AN IRONICAL AIR WATCHED HIS SON GOING UPSTAIRS TILL HE PASSED OUT OF SIGHT WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM HE PROMPTLY ASKED SMERDYAKOV
3869-700-0003 ALL RELATING TO HIS EXPECTED VISITOR AND THESE QUESTIONS WE WILL OMIT HALF AN HOUR LATER THE HOUSE WAS LOCKED AND THE CRAZY OLD MAN WAS WANDERING ALONG THROUGH THE ROOMS IN EXCITED EXPECTATION OF HEARING EVERY MINUTE THE FIVE KNOCKS AGREED UPON
3869-700-0004 NOW AND THEN HE PEERED OUT INTO THE DARKNESS SEEING NOTHING IT WAS VERY LATE
3869-700-0005 HE SAT UP LATE THAT NIGHT TILL TWO O'CLOCK BUT WE WILL NOT GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS THOUGHTS AND THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO LOOK INTO THAT SOUL ITS TURN WILL COME AND EVEN IF ONE TRIED IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THEM
3869-700-0006 FOR THERE WERE NO THOUGHTS IN HIS BRAIN BUT SOMETHING VERY VAGUE AND ABOVE ALL INTENSE EXCITEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF THAT HE HAD LOST HIS BEARINGS HE WAS FRETTED TOO BY ALL SORTS OF STRANGE AND ALMOST SURPRISING DESIRES
3869-700-0007 FOR INSTANCE AFTER MIDNIGHT HE SUDDENLY HAD AN INTENSE IRRESISTIBLE INCLINATION TO GO DOWN OPEN THE DOOR GO TO THE LODGE AND BEAT SMERDYAKOV BUT IF HE HAD BEEN ASKED WHY HE COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ANY EXACT REASON
3869-700-0008 EXCEPT PERHAPS THAT HE LOATHED THE VALET AS ONE WHO HAD INSULTED HIM MORE GRAVELY THAN ANY ONE IN THE WORLD ON THE OTHER HAND HE WAS MORE THAN ONCE THAT NIGHT OVERCOME BY A SORT OF INEXPLICABLE HUMILIATING TERROR
3869-700-0009 WHICH HE FELT POSITIVELY PARALYZED HIS PHYSICAL POWERS HIS HEAD ACHED AND HE WAS GIDDY A FEELING OF HATRED WAS RANKLING IN HIS HEART AS THOUGH HE MEANT TO AVENGE HIMSELF ON SOME ONE HE EVEN HATED ALYOSHA
3869-700-0010 RECALLING THE CONVERSATION HE HAD JUST HAD WITH HIM AT MOMENTS HE HATED HIMSELF INTENSELY OF KATERINA IVANOVNA HE ALMOST FORGOT TO THINK AND WONDERED GREATLY AT THIS AFTERWARDS ESPECIALLY AS HE REMEMBERED PERFECTLY THAT
3869-700-0011 WHEN HE HAD PROTESTED SO VALIANTLY TO KATERINA IVANOVNA THAT HE WOULD GO AWAY NEXT DAY TO MOSCOW SOMETHING HAD WHISPERED IN HIS HEART THAT'S NONSENSE YOU ARE NOT GOING AND IT WON'T BE SO EASY TO TEAR YOURSELF AWAY AS YOU ARE BOASTING NOW
3869-700-0012 REMEMBERING THAT NIGHT LONG AFTERWARDS
3869-700-0013 HOW HE HAD SUDDENLY GOT UP FROM THE SOFA AND HAD STEALTHILY AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID OF BEING WATCHED OPENED THE DOOR GONE OUT ON THE STAIRCASE AND LISTENED TO FYODOR PAVLOVITCH STIRRING DOWN BELOW HAD LISTENED A LONG WHILE SOME FIVE MINUTES
3869-700-0014 WITH A SORT OF STRANGE CURIOSITY HOLDING HIS BREATH WHILE HIS HEART THROBBED AND WHY HE HAD DONE ALL THIS WHY HE WAS LISTENING HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT ACTION ALL HIS LIFE AFTERWARDS HE CALLED INFAMOUS
3869-700-0015 AND AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART HE THOUGHT OF IT AS THE BASEST ACTION OF HIS LIFE FOR FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HIMSELF HE FELT NO HATRED AT THAT MOMENT BUT WAS SIMPLY INTENSELY CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW HE WAS WALKING DOWN THERE BELOW AND WHAT HE MUST BE DOING NOW
3869-700-0016 HE WONDERED AND IMAGINED HOW HE MUST BE PEEPING OUT OF THE DARK WINDOWS AND STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM LISTENING LISTENING FOR SOME ONE TO KNOCK
3869-700-0017 ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK WHEN EVERYTHING WAS QUIET AND EVEN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HAD GONE TO BED
3869-700-0018 FIRMLY RESOLVED TO FALL ASLEEP AT ONCE AS HE FELT FEARFULLY EXHAUSTED AND HE DID FALL ASLEEP AT ONCE AND SLEPT SOUNDLY WITHOUT DREAMS BUT WAKED EARLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT
3869-700-0019 OPENING HIS EYES HE WAS SURPRISED TO FEEL HIMSELF EXTRAORDINARILY VIGOROUS HE JUMPED UP AT ONCE AND DRESSED QUICKLY THEN DRAGGED OUT HIS TRUNK AND BEGAN PACKING IMMEDIATELY
3869-700-0020 AND HIS DEPARTURE CERTAINLY WAS SUDDEN
3869-700-0021 AND SMERDYAKOV THAT HE WAS LEAVING NEXT DAY YET HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF DEPARTURE WHEN HE WENT TO BED OR AT LEAST HAD NOT DREAMED THAT HIS FIRST ACT IN THE MORNING WOULD BE TO PACK HIS TRUNK AT LAST HIS TRUNK AND BAG WERE READY
3869-700-0022 IT WAS ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK WHEN MARFA IGNATYEVNA CAME IN WITH HER USUAL INQUIRY WHERE WILL YOUR HONOR TAKE YOUR TEA IN YOUR OWN ROOM OR DOWNSTAIRS HE LOOKED ALMOST CHEERFUL BUT THERE WAS ABOUT HIM ABOUT HIS WORDS AND GESTURES
3869-700-0023 SOMETHING HURRIED AND SCATTERED GREETING HIS FATHER AFFABLY AND EVEN INQUIRING SPECIALLY AFTER HIS HEALTH THOUGH HE DID NOT WAIT TO HEAR HIS ANSWER TO THE END HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS STARTING OFF IN AN HOUR TO RETURN TO MOSCOW FOR GOOD AND BEGGED HIM TO SEND FOR THE HORSES
3869-700-0024 HIS FATHER HEARD THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WITH NO SIGN OF SURPRISE AND FORGOT IN AN UNMANNERLY WAY TO SHOW REGRET AT LOSING HIM INSTEAD OF DOING SO HE FLEW INTO A GREAT FLUTTER AT THE RECOLLECTION OF SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS OF HIS OWN
3869-700-0025 WHAT A FELLOW YOU ARE NOT TO TELL ME YESTERDAY NEVER MIND WE'LL MANAGE IT ALL THE SAME DO ME A GREAT SERVICE MY DEAR BOY GO TO TCHERMASHNYA ON THE WAY
3869-700-0026 IT'S ONLY TO TURN TO THE LEFT FROM THE STATION AT VOLOVYA ONLY ANOTHER TWELVE VERSTS AND YOU COME TO TCHERMASHNYA I'M SORRY I CAN'T IT'S EIGHTY VERSTS TO THE RAILWAY AND THE TRAIN STARTS FOR MOSCOW AT SEVEN O'CLOCK TO NIGHT
3869-700-0027 I CAN ONLY JUST CATCH IT YOU'LL CATCH IT TO MORROW OR THE DAY AFTER BUT TO DAY TURN OFF TO TCHERMASHNYA IT WON'T PUT YOU OUT MUCH TO HUMOR YOUR FATHER IF I HADN'T HAD SOMETHING TO KEEP ME HERE I WOULD HAVE RUN OVER MYSELF LONG AGO
3869-700-0028 FOR I'VE SOME BUSINESS THERE IN A HURRY BUT HERE I IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR ME TO GO NOW YOU SEE I'VE TWO PIECES OF COPSE LAND THERE THE MASLOVS AN OLD MERCHANT AND HIS SON WILL GIVE EIGHT THOUSAND FOR THE TIMBER
3869-700-0029 BUT LAST YEAR I JUST MISSED A PURCHASER WHO WOULD HAVE GIVEN TWELVE THERE'S NO GETTING ANY ONE ABOUT HERE TO BUY IT THE MASLOVS HAVE IT ALL THEIR OWN WAY ONE HAS TO TAKE WHAT THEY'LL GIVE FOR NO ONE HERE DARE BID AGAINST THEM
3869-700-0030 THE PRIEST AT ILYINSKOE WROTE TO ME LAST THURSDAY THAT A MERCHANT CALLED GORSTKIN A MAN I KNOW HAD TURNED UP WHAT MAKES HIM VALUABLE IS THAT HE IS NOT FROM THESE PARTS SO HE IS NOT AFRAID OF THE MASLOVS
3869-700-0031 HE SAYS HE WILL GIVE ME ELEVEN THOUSAND FOR THE COPSE DO YOU HEAR BUT HE'LL ONLY BE HERE THE PRIEST WRITES FOR A WEEK ALTOGETHER SO YOU MUST GO AT ONCE AND MAKE A BARGAIN WITH HIM WELL YOU WRITE TO THE PRIEST
3869-700-0032 HE'LL MAKE THE BARGAIN HE CAN'T DO IT HE HAS NO EYE FOR BUSINESS HE IS A PERFECT TREASURE I'D GIVE HIM TWENTY THOUSAND TO TAKE CARE OF FOR ME WITHOUT A RECEIPT BUT HE HAS NO EYE FOR BUSINESS HE IS A PERFECT CHILD
3869-700-0033 A CROW COULD DECEIVE HIM AND YET HE IS A LEARNED MAN WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THIS GORSTKIN LOOKS LIKE A PEASANT HE WEARS A BLUE KAFTAN BUT HE IS A REGULAR ROGUE THAT'S THE COMMON COMPLAINT HE IS A LIAR
3869-700-0034 HE TOLD ME THE YEAR BEFORE LAST THAT HIS WIFE WAS DEAD AND THAT HE HAD MARRIED ANOTHER AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THERE WAS NOT A WORD OF TRUTH IN IT
3869-700-0035 SHE IS ALIVE TO THIS DAY AND GIVES HIM A BEATING TWICE A WEEK SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT IS WHETHER HE IS LYING OR SPEAKING THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAYS HE WANTS TO BUY IT AND WOULD GIVE ELEVEN THOUSAND I SHALL BE NO USE IN SUCH A BUSINESS I HAVE NO EYE EITHER
3869-700-0036 STAY WAIT A BIT YOU WILL BE OF USE FOR I WILL TELL YOU THE SIGNS BY WHICH YOU CAN JUDGE ABOUT GORSTKIN I'VE DONE BUSINESS WITH HIM A LONG TIME YOU SEE YOU MUST WATCH HIS BEARD HE HAS A NASTY THIN RED BEARD
3869-700-0037 IF HIS BEARD SHAKES WHEN HE TALKS AND HE GETS CROSS IT'S ALL RIGHT HE IS SAYING WHAT HE MEANS HE WANTS TO DO BUSINESS BUT IF HE STROKES HIS BEARD WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND GRINS HE IS TRYING TO CHEAT YOU DON'T WATCH HIS EYES
3869-700-0038 BUT DON'T CALL HIM SO HE WILL BE OFFENDED IF YOU COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HIM AND SEE IT'S ALL RIGHT WRITE HERE AT ONCE YOU NEED ONLY WRITE HE'S NOT LYING
3869-700-0039 STAND OUT FOR ELEVEN THOUSAND ONE THOUSAND YOU CAN KNOCK OFF BUT NOT MORE JUST THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EIGHT THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THOUSAND

3869-700-0045 BUT TO DAY HE SEEMED TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF OF DMITRI FOR INSTANCE HE DID NOT SAY A WORD HE WAS QUITE UNMOVED BY THE PARTING AND SEEMED IN FACT AT A LOSS FOR SOMETHING TO SAY
3869-700-0046 HE MUST BE BORED WITH ME HE THOUGHT ONLY WHEN ACCOMPANYING HIS SON OUT ON TO THE STEPS THE OLD MAN BEGAN TO FUSS ABOUT HE WOULD HAVE KISSED HIM
3869-700-0047 OBVIOUSLY AVOIDING THE KISS HIS FATHER SAW IT AT ONCE AND INSTANTLY PULLED HIMSELF UP WELL GOOD LUCK TO YOU GOOD LUCK TO YOU HE REPEATED FROM THE STEPS YOU'LL COME AGAIN SOME TIME OR OTHER
3869-700-0048 MIND YOU DO COME I SHALL ALWAYS BE GLAD TO SEE YOU WELL CHRIST BE WITH YOU
3869-700-0049 DON'T BE TOO HARD ON ME THE FATHER CALLED FOR THE LAST TIME THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD CAME OUT TO TAKE LEAVE SMERDYAKOV MARFA AND GRIGORY
3869-700-0050 WHEN HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CARRIAGE SMERDYAKOV JUMPED UP TO ARRANGE THE RUG YOU SEE I AM GOING TO TCHERMASHNYA
3869-700-0051 AGAIN AS THE DAY BEFORE THE WORDS SEEMED TO DROP OF THEMSELVES AND HE LAUGHED TOO A PECULIAR NERVOUS LAUGH HE REMEMBERED IT LONG AFTER IT'S A TRUE SAYING THEN THAT IT'S ALWAYS WORTH WHILE SPEAKING TO A CLEVER MAN
3869-700-0052 THE CARRIAGE ROLLED AWAY NOTHING WAS CLEAR IN IVAN'S SOUL BUT HE LOOKED EAGERLY AROUND HIM AT THE FIELDS AT THE HILLS AT THE TREES AT A FLOCK OF GEESE FLYING HIGH OVERHEAD IN THE BRIGHT SKY
3869-700-0053 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE FELT VERY HAPPY HE TRIED TO TALK TO THE DRIVER AND HE FELT INTENSELY INTERESTED IN AN ANSWER THE PEASANT MADE HIM BUT A MINUTE LATER HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS NOT CATCHING ANYTHING
3869-700-0054 AND THAT HE HAD NOT REALLY EVEN TAKEN IN THE PEASANT'S ANSWER HE WAS SILENT AND IT WAS PLEASANT EVEN SO
3869-700-0055 THEY REACHED THE STATION QUICKLY CHANGED HORSES AND GALLOPED TO VOLOVYA WHY IS IT WORTH WHILE SPEAKING TO A CLEVER MAN WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THAT THE THOUGHT SEEMED SUDDENLY TO CLUTCH AT HIS BREATHING
3869-700-0056 AND WHY DID I TELL HIM I WAS GOING TO TCHERMASHNYA THEY REACHED VOLOVYA STATION
3869-700-0057 I WON'T GO TO TCHERMASHNYA AM I TOO LATE TO REACH THE RAILWAY BY SEVEN BROTHERS WE SHALL JUST DO IT SHALL WE GET THE CARRIAGE OUT AT ONCE WILL ANY ONE OF YOU BE GOING TO THE TOWN TO MORROW
3869-700-0058 I'VE DONE WITH THE OLD WORLD FOR EVER AND MAY I HAVE NO NEWS NO ECHO FROM IT TO A NEW LIFE NEW PLACES AND NO LOOKING BACK BUT INSTEAD OF DELIGHT HIS SOUL WAS FILLED WITH SUCH GLOOM
3869-700-0059 AND HIS HEART ACHED WITH SUCH ANGUISH AS HE HAD NEVER KNOWN IN HIS LIFE BEFORE HE WAS THINKING ALL THE NIGHT THE TRAIN FLEW ON AND ONLY AT DAYBREAK WHEN HE WAS APPROACHING MOSCOW HE SUDDENLY ROUSED HIMSELF FROM HIS MEDITATION
3869-700-0060 I AM A SCOUNDREL HE WHISPERED TO HIMSELF FYODOR PAVLOVITCH REMAINED WELL SATISFIED AT HAVING SEEN HIS SON OFF FOR TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS HE FELT ALMOST HAPPY AND SAT DRINKING BRANDY
3869-700-0061 FORTUNATELY MARFA IGNATYEVNA WAS IN THE YARD AND HEARD HIM IN TIME SHE DID NOT SEE THE FALL BUT HEARD HIS SCREAM THE STRANGE PECULIAR SCREAM LONG FAMILIAR TO HER THE SCREAM OF THE EPILEPTIC FALLING IN A FIT
3869-700-0062 THEY COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THE FIT HAD COME ON HIM AT THE MOMENT HE WAS DESCENDING THE STEPS SO THAT HE MUST HAVE FALLEN UNCONSCIOUS OR WHETHER IT WAS THE FALL AND THE SHOCK THAT HAD CAUSED THE FIT IN SMERDYAKOV WHO WAS KNOWN TO BE LIABLE TO THEM THEY FOUND HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CELLAR STEPS
3869-700-0063 WRITHING IN CONVULSIONS AND FOAMING AT THE MOUTH IT WAS THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT HE MUST HAVE BROKEN SOMETHING AN ARM OR A LEG AND HURT HIMSELF BUT GOD HAD PRESERVED HIM AS MARFA IGNATYEVNA EXPRESSED IT
3869-700-0064 NOTHING OF THE KIND HAD HAPPENED BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET HIM OUT OF THE CELLAR THEY ASKED THE NEIGHBORS TO HELP AND MANAGED IT SOMEHOW FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HIMSELF WAS PRESENT AT THE WHOLE CEREMONY HE HELPED
3869-700-0065 EVIDENTLY ALARMED AND UPSET THE SICK MAN DID NOT REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS THE CONVULSIONS CEASED FOR A TIME BUT THEN BEGAN AGAIN AND EVERY ONE CONCLUDED THAT THE SAME THING WOULD HAPPEN AS HAD HAPPENED A YEAR BEFORE WHEN HE ACCIDENTALLY FELL FROM THE GARRET
3869-700-0066 THEY REMEMBERED THAT ICE HAD BEEN PUT ON HIS HEAD THEN THERE WAS STILL ICE IN THE CELLAR AND MARFA IGNATYEVNA HAD SOME BROUGHT UP IN THE EVENING FYODOR PAVLOVITCH SENT FOR DOCTOR HERZENSTUBE WHO ARRIVED AT ONCE
3869-700-0067 THAT MEANWHILE HE HERZENSTUBE DID NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND IT BUT THAT BY TO MORROW MORNING IF THE PRESENT REMEDIES WERE UNAVAILING HE WOULD VENTURE TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE THE INVALID WAS TAKEN TO THE LODGE TO A ROOM NEXT TO GRIGORY'S
3869-700-0068 AND MARFA IGNATYEVNA'S THEN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HAD ONE MISFORTUNE AFTER ANOTHER TO PUT UP WITH THAT DAY MARFA IGNATYEVNA COOKED THE DINNER AND THE SOUP COMPARED WITH SMERDYAKOV'S WAS NO BETTER THAN DISH WATER
3869-700-0069 AND THE FOWL WAS SO DRIED UP THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MASTICATE IT TO HER MASTER'S BITTER THOUGH DESERVED REPROACHES MARFA IGNATYEVNA REPLIED THAT THE FOWL WAS A VERY OLD ONE TO BEGIN WITH AND THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN TRAINED AS A COOK
3869-700-0070 IN THE EVENING THERE WAS ANOTHER TROUBLE IN STORE FOR FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HE WAS INFORMED THAT GRIGORY WHO HAD NOT BEEN WELL FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS WAS COMPLETELY LAID UP BY HIS LUMBAGO
3869-700-0071 FYODOR PAVLOVITCH FINISHED HIS TEA AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND LOCKED HIMSELF UP ALONE IN THE HOUSE HE WAS IN TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT AND SUSPENSE THAT EVENING HE RECKONED ON GRUSHENKA'S COMING ALMOST AS A CERTAINTY
3869-700-0072 HE HAD RECEIVED FROM SMERDYAKOV THAT MORNING AN ASSURANCE THAT SHE HAD PROMISED TO COME WITHOUT FAIL THE INCORRIGIBLE OLD MAN'S HEART THROBBED WITH EXCITEMENT HE PACED UP AND DOWN HIS EMPTY ROOMS LISTENING
3869-700-0073 HE HAD TO BE ON THE ALERT DMITRI MIGHT BE ON THE WATCH FOR HER SOMEWHERE AND WHEN SHE KNOCKED ON THE WINDOW SMERDYAKOV HAD INFORMED HIM TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT HE HAD TOLD HER WHERE AND HOW TO KNOCK THE DOOR MUST BE OPENED AT ONCE
