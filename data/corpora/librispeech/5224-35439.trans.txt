5224-35439-0000 THE BISHOP'S VISION THE BISHOP IS OUT OF HAND ERNEST WROTE ME HE IS CLEAR UP IN THE AIR TONIGHT HE IS GOING TO BEGIN PUTTING TO RIGHTS THIS VERY MISERABLE WORLD OF OURS
5224-35439-0001 HE IS GOING TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE HE HAS TOLD ME SO AND I CANNOT DISSUADE HIM
5224-35439-0002 TO NIGHT HE IS CHAIRMAN OF THE I P H AND HE WILL EMBODY HIS MESSAGE IN HIS INTRODUCTORY REMARKS THERE IS NO CLEW TO THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR WHICH THESE INITIALS STAND
5224-35439-0003 MAY I BRING YOU TO HEAR HIM OF COURSE HE IS FOREDOOMED TO FUTILITY IT WILL BREAK YOUR HEART IT WILL BREAK HIS BUT FOR YOU IT WILL BE AN EXCELLENT OBJECT LESSON
5224-35439-0004 I WANT TO REDEEM IN YOUR EYES SOME SMALL MEASURE OF MY UNWORTHINESS AND SO IT IS THAT MY PRIDE DESIRES THAT YOU SHALL KNOW MY THINKING IS CORRECT AND RIGHT MY VIEWS ARE HARSH
5224-35439-0005 THE FUTILITY OF SO NOBLE A SOUL AS THE BISHOP WILL SHOW YOU THE COMPULSION FOR SUCH HARSHNESS SO COME TO NIGHT SAD THOUGH THIS NIGHT'S HAPPENING WILL BE I FEEL THAT IT WILL BUT DRAW YOU MORE CLOSELY TO ME
5224-35439-0006 THE I P H HELD ITS CONVENTION THAT NIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO
5224-35439-0007 THIS CONVENTION HAD BEEN CALLED TO CONSIDER PUBLIC IMMORALITY AND THE REMEDY FOR IT BISHOP MOREHOUSE PRESIDED HE WAS VERY NERVOUS AS HE SAT ON THE PLATFORM AND I COULD SEE THE HIGH TENSION HE WAS UNDER BY HIS SIDE WERE BISHOP DICKINSON
5224-35439-0008 AND THEN IN THE DARKNESS THE QUESTION CAME TO ME WHAT IS TO BE DONE WHAT IS TO BE DONE A LITTLE LATER THE QUESTION CAME TO ME IN ANOTHER WAY WHAT WOULD THE MASTER DO AND WITH THE QUESTION A GREAT LIGHT SEEMED TO FILL THE PLACE
5224-35439-0009 AS SAUL SAW HIS ON THE WAY TO DAMASCUS I STOPPED THE CARRIAGE GOT OUT AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES CONVERSATION PERSUADED TWO OF THE PUBLIC WOMEN TO GET INTO THE BROUGHAM WITH ME IF JESUS WAS RIGHT THEN THESE TWO UNFORTUNATES WERE MY SISTERS
5224-35439-0010 AND THE ONLY HOPE OF THEIR PURIFICATION WAS IN MY AFFECTION AND TENDERNESS I LIVE IN ONE OF THE LOVELIEST LOCALITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO THE HOUSE IN WHICH I LIVE COST A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ITS FURNISHINGS BOOKS AND WORKS OF ART COST AS MUCH MORE
5224-35439-0011 THE HOUSE IS A MANSION NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS I NEVER KNEW WHAT PALACES WERE GOOD FOR I HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE TO LIVE IN BUT NOW I KNOW I TOOK THE TWO WOMEN OF THE STREET TO MY PALACE
5224-35439-0012 AND THEY ARE GOING TO STAY WITH ME I HOPE TO FILL EVERY ROOM IN MY PALACE WITH SUCH SISTERS AS THEY THE AUDIENCE HAD BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE RESTLESS AND UNSETTLED AND THE FACES OF THOSE THAT SAT ON THE PLATFORM HAD BEEN BETRAYING GREATER AND GREATER DISMAY AND CONSTERNATION
5224-35439-0013 FLED FROM THE PLATFORM AND THE HALL BUT BISHOP MOREHOUSE OBLIVIOUS TO ALL HIS EYES FILLED WITH HIS VISION CONTINUED
5224-35439-0014 THEY ARE MADE TO CARRY THE WEAK THE SICK AND THE AGED THEY ARE MADE TO SHOW HONOR TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THE SENSE EVEN OF SHAME I DID NOT KNOW WHAT PALACES WERE MADE FOR BUT NOW I HAVE FOUND A USE FOR THEM THE PALACES OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE HOSPITALS
5224-35439-0015 AND NURSERIES FOR THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE AND ARE PERISHING HE MADE A LONG PAUSE PLAINLY OVERCOME BY THE THOUGHT THAT WAS IN HIM AND NERVOUS HOW BEST TO EXPRESS IT I AM NOT FIT DEAR BRETHREN
5224-35439-0016 TO TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT MORALITY I HAVE LIVED IN SHAME AND HYPOCRISIES TOO LONG TO BE ABLE TO HELP OTHERS BUT MY ACTION WITH THOSE WOMEN SISTERS OF MINE SHOWS ME THAT THE BETTER WAY IS EASY TO FIND TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN JESUS AND HIS GOSPEL
5224-35439-0017 THERE CAN BE NO OTHER RELATION BETWEEN MAN AND MAN THAN THE RELATION OF AFFECTION LOVE ALONE IS STRONGER THAN SIN STRONGER THAN DEATH I THEREFORE SAY TO THE RICH AMONG YOU THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY TO DO WHAT I HAVE DONE AND AM DOING
5224-35439-0018 LET EACH ONE OF YOU WHO IS PROSPEROUS TAKE INTO HIS HOUSE SOME THIEF AND TREAT HIM AS HIS BROTHER SOME UNFORTUNATE AND TREAT HER AS HIS SISTER AND SAN FRANCISCO WILL NEED NO POLICE FORCE AND NO MAGISTRATES THE PRISONS WILL BE TURNED INTO HOSPITALS
5224-35439-0019 AND THE CRIMINAL WILL DISAPPEAR WITH HIS CRIME WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE WE MUST DO AS CHRIST DID THAT IS THE MESSAGE OF THE CHURCH TODAY
5224-35439-0020 WE HAVE PUT MAMMON IN THE PLACE OF CHRIST I HAVE HERE A POEM THAT TELLS THE WHOLE STORY I SHOULD LIKE TO READ IT TO YOU
5224-35439-0021 IT IS AN ATTACK UPON ALL CHURCHES UPON THE POMP AND SPLENDOR OF ALL CHURCHES THAT HAVE WANDERED FROM THE MASTER'S PATH AND HEDGED THEMSELVES IN FROM HIS LAMBS HERE IT IS THE SILVER TRUMPETS RANG ACROSS THE DOME
5224-35439-0022 THE PEOPLE KNELT UPON THE GROUND WITH AWE AND BORNE UPON THE NECKS OF MEN I SAW LIKE SOME GREAT GOD THE HOLY LORD OF ROME PRIEST LIKE HE WORE A ROBE MORE WHITE THAN FOAM
5224-35439-0023 AND KING LIKE SWATHED HIMSELF IN ROYAL RED THREE CROWNS OF GOLD ROSE HIGH UPON HIS HEAD IN SPLENDOR AND IN LIGHT THE POPE PASSED HOME MY HEART STOLE BACK ACROSS WIDE WASTES OF YEARS TO ONE WHO WANDERED BY A LONELY SEA
5224-35439-0024 THAT BITTERLY YOU OPPRESS THE MASTER'S LAMBS
5224-35439-0025 THE VOICES OF PAIN AND SORROW THAT YOU WILL NOT HEAR BUT THAT SOME DAY WILL BE HEARD AND SO I SAY BUT AT THIS POINT H H JONES AND PHILIP WARD WHO HAD ALREADY RISEN FROM THEIR CHAIRS LED THE BISHOP OFF THE PLATFORM WHILE THE AUDIENCE SAT BREATHLESS AND SHOCKED
5224-35439-0026 ERNEST LAUGHED HARSHLY AND SAVAGELY WHEN HE HAD GAINED THE STREET HIS LAUGHTER JARRED UPON ME MY HEART SEEMED READY TO BURST WITH SUPPRESSED TEARS HE HAS DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE ERNEST CRIED THE MANHOOD AND THE DEEP HIDDEN TENDER NATURE OF THEIR BISHOP BURST OUT
5224-35439-0027 AND HIS CHRISTIAN AUDIENCE THAT LOVED HIM CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS CRAZY DID YOU SEE THEM LEADING HIM SO SOLICITOUSLY FROM THE PLATFORM THERE MUST HAVE BEEN LAUGHTER IN HELL AT THE SPECTACLE NEVERTHELESS IT WILL MAKE A GREAT IMPRESSION WHAT THE BISHOP DID AND SAID TO NIGHT I SAID
5224-35439-0028 THINK SO ERNEST QUERIED MOCKINGLY IT WILL MAKE A SENSATION I ASSERTED DIDN'T YOU SEE THE REPORTERS SCRIBBLING LIKE MAD WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING NOT A LINE OF WHICH WILL APPEAR IN TO MORROW'S PAPERS I CAN'T BELIEVE IT I CRIED
5224-35439-0029 JUST WAIT AND SEE WAS THE ANSWER NOT A LINE NOT A THOUGHT THAT HE UTTERED THE DAILY PRESS THE DAILY SUPPRESSAGE
5224-35439-0030 I SAW THEM NOT A WORD THAT HE UTTERED WILL SEE PRINT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THE EDITORS THEY DRAW THEIR SALARIES FOR THE POLICY THEY MAINTAIN THEIR POLICY IS TO PRINT NOTHING THAT IS A VITAL MENACE TO THE ESTABLISHED
5224-35439-0031 THE BISHOP'S UTTERANCE WAS A VIOLENT ASSAULT UPON THE ESTABLISHED MORALITY IT WAS HERESY THEY LED HIM FROM THE PLATFORM TO PREVENT HIM FROM UTTERING MORE HERESY THE NEWSPAPERS WILL PURGE HIS HERESY IN THE OBLIVION OF SILENCE THE PRESS OF THE UNITED STATES
5224-35439-0032 IT IS A PARASITIC GROWTH THAT BATTENS ON THE CAPITALIST CLASS ITS FUNCTION IS TO SERVE THE ESTABLISHED BY MOULDING PUBLIC OPINION AND RIGHT WELL IT SERVES IT LET ME PROPHESY
5224-35439-0033 TO MORROW'S PAPERS WILL MERELY MENTION THAT THE BISHOP IS IN POOR HEALTH THAT HE HAS BEEN WORKING TOO HARD AND THAT HE BROKE DOWN LAST NIGHT THE NEXT MENTION SOME DAYS HENCE WILL BE TO THE EFFECT THAT HE IS SUFFERING FROM NERVOUS PROSTRATION
5224-35439-0034 AFTER THAT ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN EITHER THE BISHOP WILL SEE THE ERROR OF HIS WAY AND RETURN FROM HIS VACATION A WELL MAN IN WHOSE EYES THERE ARE NO MORE VISIONS OR ELSE HE WILL PERSIST IN HIS MADNESS AND THEN YOU MAY EXPECT TO SEE IN THE PAPERS
5224-35439-0035 COUCHED PATHETICALLY AND TENDERLY THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS INSANITY AFTER THAT
5224-35439-0036 NOW THERE YOU GO TOO FAR I CRIED OUT IN THE EYES OF SOCIETY IT WILL TRULY BE INSANITY HE REPLIED WHAT HONEST MAN WHO IS NOT INSANE WOULD TAKE LOST WOMEN AND THIEVES INTO HIS HOUSE TO DWELL WITH HIM SISTERLY AND BROTHERLY
5224-35439-0037 TRUE CHRIST DIED BETWEEN TWO THIEVES BUT THAT IS ANOTHER STORY INSANITY THE MENTAL PROCESSES OF THE MAN WITH WHOM ONE DISAGREES ARE ALWAYS WRONG THEREFORE THE MIND OF THE MAN IS WRONG WHERE IS THE LINE BETWEEN WRONG MIND AND INSANE MIND
5224-35439-0038 IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY SANE MAN CAN RADICALLY DISAGREE WITH ONE'S MOST SANE CONCLUSIONS THERE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT IN THIS EVENING'S PAPER MARY MC KENNA LIVES SOUTH OF MARKET STREET SHE IS A POOR BUT HONEST WOMAN SHE IS ALSO PATRIOTIC
5224-35439-0039 BUT SHE HAS ERRONEOUS IDEAS CONCERNING THE AMERICAN FLAG AND THE PROTECTION IT IS SUPPOSED TO SYMBOLIZE AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
5224-35439-0040 IN SPITE OF TAKING IN WASHING SHE GOT BEHIND IN HER RENT YESTERDAY THEY EVICTED HER BUT FIRST SHE HOISTED AN AMERICAN FLAG AND FROM UNDER ITS FOLDS SHE ANNOUNCED THAT BY VIRTUE OF ITS PROTECTION THEY COULD NOT TURN HER OUT ON TO THE COLD STREET WHAT WAS DONE
5224-35439-0041 SHE WAS ARRESTED AND ARRAIGNED FOR INSANITY TO DAY SHE WAS EXAMINED BY THE REGULAR INSANITY EXPERTS SHE WAS FOUND INSANE SHE WAS CONSIGNED TO THE NAPA ASYLUM
5224-35439-0042 SUPPOSE I SHOULD DISAGREE WITH EVERYBODY ABOUT THE LITERARY STYLE OF A BOOK THEY WOULDN'T SEND ME TO AN ASYLUM FOR THAT VERY TRUE HE REPLIED BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY THEREIN LIES THE DIFFERENCE
5224-35439-0043 THE DIVERGENCE OF OPINION ON THE PARTS OF MARY MC KENNA AND THE BISHOP DO MENACE SOCIETY WHAT IF ALL THE POOR PEOPLE SHOULD REFUSE TO PAY RENT AND SHELTER THEMSELVES UNDER THE AMERICAN FLAG LANDLORDISM WOULD GO CRUMBLING
5224-35439-0044 THE BISHOP'S VIEWS ARE JUST AS PERILOUS TO SOCIETY ERGO TO THE ASYLUM WITH HIM
5224-35439-0045 WAIT AND SEE ERNEST SAID AND I WAITED NEXT MORNING I SENT OUT FOR ALL THE PAPERS SO FAR ERNEST WAS RIGHT NOT A WORD THAT BISHOP MOREHOUSE HAD UTTERED WAS IN PRINT MENTION WAS MADE IN ONE OR TWO OF THE PAPERS THAT HE HAD BEEN OVERCOME BY HIS FEELINGS
5224-35439-0046 YET THE PLATITUDES OF THE SPEAKERS THAT FOLLOWED HIM WERE REPORTED AT LENGTH SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY ON A VACATION TO RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF OVERWORK
