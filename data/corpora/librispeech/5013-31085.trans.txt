5013-31085-0000 THE SINGING MOUSE CAME OUT QUAINTLY AND SWEETLY AND WITH WONDROUS CLEARNESS IT BEGAN AN OLD OLD SONG I FIRST HEARD LONG AGO AND AS IT SANG
5013-31085-0001 BACK WITH RED ELECTRIC THRILL CAME THE FINE BLOOD OF YOUTH AND BEAT IN PULSE WITH THE SONG WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS YOUNG LAD AND ALL THE TREES ARE GREEN
5013-31085-0002 AND EVERY GOOSE A SWAN LAD AND EVERY LASS A QUEEN THEN HEY FOR BOOT AND SADDLE LAD AND ROUND THE WORLD AWAY YOUNG BLOOD MUST HAVE ITS COURSE LAD
5013-31085-0003 AND EVERY DOG HIS DAY AND YOUNG BLOOD BEGAN ITS COURSE ANEW BOOTED AND SPURRED INTO THE SADDLE AGAIN FACE TOWARD THE WEST AND OFF
5013-31085-0004 AND TUMBLES OF GREEN OCEANS UNSWUM CONTINENTS UNTRACKED OF THOUSANDFOLD GREEN THEN ON BEYOND THE GRAY THE GRAY BROWN
5013-31085-0005 NEARER THAN THAT A BROAD SLASH OF GREAT GOLDEN YELLOW A BAND OF THE STURDY PRAIRIE SUNFLOWERS AND NEARER THAN THAT SWIMMING ON THE SURFACE OF THE MYSTERIOUS WAVE
5013-31085-0006 WHICH CONSTANTLY PASSES BUT IS NEVER PAST ON THE PRAIRIES BRIGHT RED ROSES AND STRONG LARKSPUR AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS EVER SHIFTING SEA JEWELS
5013-31085-0007 IN GOD'S BEST BLUE ENAMEL YOU CAN NOT FIND THIS ENAMEL IN THE WINDOWS ONE MUST SEND FOR IT TO THE LAND OF THE UNSWUM SEA A LITTLE HIGHER AND STRONGER
5013-31085-0008 PIPED THE COMPELLING MELODY WHY
5013-31085-0009 GOD BLESS THEM NAY BROTHER GOD HAS BLESSED THEM BLESSED THEM WITH UNBOUNDED CALM WITH BOUNDLESS STRENGTH WITH UNSPEAKABLE PEACE YOU CAN
5013-31085-0010 TAKE YOUR TROUBLES TO THE MOUNTAINS IF YOU ARE PUEBLO AZTEC YOU CAN SELECT SOME BIG MOUNTAIN AND PRAY TO IT AS ITS TOP SHOWS THE RED SENTIENCE OF THE ON COMING DAY
5013-31085-0011 YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TROUBLES TO THE SEA BUT THE SEA HAS TROUBLES OF ITS OWN AND FRETS THERE IS COMMERCE ON THE SEA AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR IT ARE FRETFUL GREEDY GRASPING
5013-31085-0012 THE MOUNTAINS HAVE NO TROUBLES THEY HAVE NO COMMERCE THE DWELLERS OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE CALM AND UNFRETTED AND ON THE BROAD SHOULDERS OF THE MOUNTAINS
5013-31085-0013 ONCE MORE WAS CAST THE BURDEN OF THE YOUNG MAN'S TROUBLES AND ONCE MORE HE WALKED DEEP INTO THE PEACE OF THE BIG HILLS AND THE MOUNTAINS SMILED NOT NEITHER WEPT
5013-31085-0014 BUT GRAVELY AND KINDLY FOLDED OVER ABOUT BEHIND THE GRAY MANTLE OF THE CANYON WALLS AND LOCKED FAST DOORS OF ADAMANT AGAINST ALL FOLLOWING
5013-31085-0015 AND SWEPT A PITYING HAND OF SHADOW
5013-31085-0016 THAT WONDROUS UNSYLLABLED VOICE OF COMFORT WHICH ANY MOUNTAIN GOER KNOWS AY THE GOODNESS OF SUCH STRENGTH UP BY THE CLEAN SNOW OVER THE BIG ROCKS
5013-31085-0017 BY THE LACE WORK STREAM WHERE THE TROUT ARE WHY IT'S ALL COME AGAIN THAT WAS THE CLINK MADE BY A PASSING DEER THAT WAS THE TOUCH OF THE GREEN BALSAM SMELL IT NOW
5013-31085-0018 FOLDING DOWN THE TOP AND THERE IS THE CRASH OF THE THUNDER AND THIS IS THE RUSH OF THE RAIN
5013-31085-0019 OVER IT ALL O SINGING MOUSE
5013-31085-0020 NOW BY SOME IMPULSE OF THE DOG WHICH HASN'T HAD ANY DAY IT IS WINTER NOW I REMEMBER SINGING MOUSE AND I AM WALKING BY THE SHORE OF THE GREAT INLAND SEAS
5013-31085-0021 THERE IS SNOW ON THE GROUND THE TREES LOOK BLACK IN CONTRAST AS YOU GAZE UP FROM THE BEACH AGAINST THE HIGH BANK IT IS COLD IT IS DARK
5013-31085-0022 THERE ARE ICICLES IN THE SKY SOMETHING IS FLYING THROUGH THE TREES BUT SILENT AS IF IT CAME OUT OF A GRAVE I HAVE BEEN WALKING I KNOW
5013-31085-0023 I HAVE WALKED A MILLION MILES AND I'M TIRED MY LEGS ARE STIFF AND MY LEGGING HAS FROZEN FAST TO MY OVERSHOE I REMEMBER THAT AND SO
5013-31085-0024 I SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE YOU KNOW AND LOOK OUT OVER THE LAKE JUST OVER THERE YOU SEE THE ICE REACHES OUT FROM THE SHORE INTO THE LAKE A LONG WAY
5013-31085-0025 AND IT IS COVERED WITH SNOW AND LOOKS WHITE I CAN FOLLOW THAT WHITE GLIMMER IN A LONG LONG CURVE TO THE RIGHT TWENTY MILES OR MORE MAYBE YES
5013-31085-0026 IT IS COLD BUT AH WHAT IS THAT OUT THERE AND WHAT IS IT DOING IT IS SETTING ALL THE LONG WHITE CURVES OF ICE AFIRE
5013-31085-0027 OUT THERE ON THE WATER THOSE ARE NOT RIPPLES THAT IS SILVER THERE WILL BE ANGELS WALKING ON THAT PATHWAY BEFORE LONG THAT IS NOT THE MOON COMING UP OVER THE LAKE IT IS THE SWINGING OPEN
5013-31085-0028 OF THE DOOR OF THE WHITE CITY OF REST HOW OLD HOW SORE A MAN CLIMBED UP THE STEEP BANK THERE WERE WHITE FIELDS
5013-31085-0029 IN THE DISTANCE A DOG BARKED AWAY ACROSS THE FIELDS A BRIGHT AND CHEERY LIGHT SHONE OUT FROM A WINDOW AND AS THE MOON ROSE HIGHER IT SHOWED THE HOUSE WHICH HELD THE LIGHT
5013-31085-0030 IT WAS NOT A LARGE HOUSE BUT IT SEEMED TO BE A HOME HOME WHAT IS THAT I WONDERED
5013-31085-0031 THAT I PULLED AT THE FROZEN LEGGING AND MOVED WITH PAIN THE LIMBS GROWN TIRED AND SORE AND AS ONE LOOKED AT THAT TWINKLING COMFORTABLE LIGHT HOW PLAINLY THE REST OF THE OLD SONG
5013-31085-0032 CAME BACK WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS OLD LAD AND ALL THE TREES ARE BROWN AND ALL THE SPORTS ARE STALE LAD AND ALL THE WHEELS RUN DOWN
5013-31085-0033 CREEP HOME AND TAKE YOUR PLACE THERE THE SICK AND MAIMED AMONG GOD GRANT YOU FIND ONE FACE THERE YOU LOVED WHEN
5013-31085-0034 THE LIGHT IN THE LITTLE HOUSE WENT OUT I THINK IT WAS A HAPPY HOME MAY YOURS BE SO
