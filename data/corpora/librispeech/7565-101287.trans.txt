7565-101287-0007 BUT AT NIGHT WHEN EVERY ONE WAS ASLEEP HALFMAN CREPT SOFTLY TO HIS BROTHERS AND SAID TO THEM LISTEN ALL OF YOU THIS MAN IS NO UNCLE OF OURS BUT AN OGRE NONSENSE
7565-101287-0008 WELL THIS VERY NIGHT YOU WILL SEE SAID HALFMAN AND HE DID NOT GO TO BED BUT HID HIMSELF AND WATCHED NOW IN A LITTLE WHILE HE SAW THE WIFE OF THE OGRE STEAL INTO THE ROOM ON TIPTOE AND SPREAD A RED CLOTH OVER THE BROTHERS

7565-101287-0010 AND LAID THEIR WHITE CLOTH OVER HIS BROTHERS NEXT HE DREW THEIR SCARLET CAPS FROM THEIR HEADS AND EXCHANGED THEM FOR THE VEILS WHICH THE OGRE'S DAUGHTERS WERE WEARING THIS WAS HARDLY DONE

7565-101287-0012 FOR SHE HAD ONLY A TINY LANTERN SLUNG AT HER WAIST WHICH DID NOT GIVE MUCH LIGHT AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE SISTERS WERE LYING SHE STOOPED DOWN AND HELD A CORNER OF THE CLOTH UP TO THE LANTERN YES IT CERTAINLY WAS RED STILL
7565-101287-0013 TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS NO MISTAKE SHE PASSED HER HANDS LIGHTLY OVER THEIR HEADS AND FELT THE CAPS THAT COVERED THEM THEN SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THE BROTHERS LAY SLEEPING BEFORE HER AND BEGAN TO KILL THEM ONE BY ONE
7565-101287-0014 AND HALFMAN WHISPERED TO HIS BROTHERS GET UP AND RUN FOR YOUR LIVES AS THE OGRESS IS KILLING HER DAUGHTERS THE BROTHERS NEEDED NO SECOND BIDDING AND IN A MOMENT WERE OUT OF THE HOUSE
