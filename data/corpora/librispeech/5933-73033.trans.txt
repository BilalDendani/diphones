5933-73033-0000 FANNY TOLD HIM THAT SHE HAD HEARD FROM STRATTON TWO DAYS SINCE AND THAT FLORENCE WAS WELL I LIKED HER VERY MUCH SAID MISTER SAUL SO DID WE ALL SHE IS COMING HERE AGAIN IN THE AUTUMN SO IT WILL NOT BE VERY LONG BEFORE YOU SEE HER AGAIN
5933-73033-0001 HOW THAT MAY BE I CANNOT TELL BUT IF YOU SEE HER THAT WILL BE OF MORE CONSEQUENCE WE SHALL ALL SEE HER OF COURSE IT WAS HERE IN THIS LANE THAT I WAS WITH HER LAST AND WISHED HER GOOD BY
5933-73033-0002 SHE DID NOT TELL YOU OF MY HAVING PARTED WITH HER THEN NOT ESPECIALLY THAT I REMEMBER AH YOU WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED IF SHE HAD TOLD YOU BUT SHE WAS QUITE RIGHT NOT TO TELL YOU
5933-73033-0003 FANNY WAS NOW A LITTLE CONFUSED SO THAT SHE COULD NOT EXACTLY CALCULATE WHAT ALL THIS MEANT MISTER SAUL WALKED ON BY HER SIDE AND FOR SOME MOMENTS NOTHING WAS SAID
5933-73033-0004 AFTER A WHILE HE RECURRED AGAIN TO HIS PARTING FROM FLORENCE I ASKED HER ADVICE ON THAT OCCASION AND SHE GAVE IT ME CLEARLY WITH A CLEAR PURPOSE AND AN ASSURED VOICE
5933-73033-0005 I LIKE A PERSON WHO WILL DO THAT YOU ARE SURE THEN THAT YOU ARE GETTING THE TRUTH OUT OF YOUR FRIEND EVEN IF IT BE A SIMPLE NEGATIVE OR A REFUSAL TO GIVE ANY REPLY TO THE QUESTION ASKED FLORENCE BURTON IS ALWAYS CLEAR IN WHAT SHE SAYS
5933-73033-0006 I HAD ASKED HER IF SHE THOUGHT THAT I MIGHT VENTURE TO HOPE FOR A MORE FAVORABLE ANSWER IF I URGED MY SUIT TO YOU AGAIN SHE CANNOT HAVE SAID YES TO THAT MISTER SAUL SHE CANNOT HAVE DONE SO
5933-73033-0007 SHE DID NOT DO SO SHE SIMPLY BADE ME ASK YOURSELF AND SHE WAS RIGHT ON SUCH A MATTER THERE IS NO ONE TO WHOM I CAN WITH PROPRIETY ADDRESS MYSELF BUT TO YOURSELF THEREFORE I NOW ASK YOU THE QUESTION
5933-73033-0008 MAY I VENTURE TO HAVE ANY HOPE HIS VOICE WAS SO SOLEMN AND THERE WAS SO MUCH OF EAGER SERIOUSNESS IN HIS FACE THAT FANNY COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO ANSWER HIM WITH QUICKNESS
5933-73033-0009 THE ANSWER THAT WAS IN HER MIND WAS IN TRUTH THIS HOW CAN YOU ASK ME TO TRY TO LOVE A MAN WHO HAS BUT SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR IN THE WORLD WHILE I MYSELF HAVE NOTHING BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS DEMEANOR
5933-73033-0010 SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST GRAND IN ITS GRAVITY WHICH MADE IT QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD SPEAK TO HIM IN THAT TONE BUT HE HAVING ASKED HIS QUESTION WAITED FOR AN ANSWER AND SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT THE LONGER SHE DELAYED IT
5933-73033-0011 THE WEAKER BECAME THE GROUND ON WHICH SHE WAS STANDING IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SHE SAID AT LAST IF IT REALLY BE SO IF YOU WILL SAY AGAIN THAT IT IS SO AFTER HEARING ME OUT TO AN END I WILL DESIST
5933-73033-0012 IN THAT CASE I WILL DESIST AND LEAVE YOU AND LEAVE CLAVERING OH MISTER SAUL DO NOT DO THAT FOR PAPA'S SAKE AND BECAUSE OF THE PARISH I WOULD DO MUCH FOR YOUR FATHER AND AS TO THE PARISH I LOVE IT WELL
5933-73033-0013 I DO NOT THINK I CAN MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW WELL I LOVE IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I CAN NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE SAME FEELING FOR ANY PLACE THAT I HAVE FOR THIS THERE IS NOT A HOUSE A FIELD A GREEN LANE THAT IS NOT DEAR TO ME
5933-73033-0014 IT IS LIKE A FIRST LOVE WITH SOME PEOPLE A FIRST LOVE WILL COME SO STRONGLY THAT IT MAKES A RENEWAL OF THE PASSION IMPOSSIBLE HE DID NOT SAY THAT IT WOULD BE SO WITH HIMSELF BUT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT HE INTENDED THAT SHE SHOULD SO UNDERSTAND HIM
5933-73033-0015 I DO NOT SEE WHY YOU SHOULD LEAVE CLAVERING SHE SAID IF YOU KNEW THE NATURE OF MY REGARD FOR YOURSELF YOU WOULD SEE WHY IT SHOULD BE SO I DO NOT SAY THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE ANY SUCH NECESSITY
5933-73033-0016 IF I WERE STRONG THERE WOULD BE NO SUCH NEED BUT I AM WEAK WEAK IN THIS AND I COULD NOT HOLD MYSELF UNDER SUCH CONTROL AS IS WANTED FOR THE WORK I HAVE TO DO WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN OF HIS LOVE FOR THE PLACE FOR THE PARISH
5933-73033-0017 HE WAS CALM AND REASONABLE AND TRANQUIL AND TALKED OF HIS GOING AWAY FROM HER AS HE MIGHT HAVE TALKED HAD SOME CHANGE OF AIR BEEN DECLARED NECESSARY FOR HIS HEALTH SHE FELT THAT THIS WAS SO AND WAS ALMOST ANGRY WITH HIM
5933-73033-0018 OF COURSE YOU MUST KNOW WHAT WILL BE BEST FOR YOURSELF SHE SAID YES I KNOW NOW WHAT I MUST DO IF SUCH IS TO BE YOUR ANSWER I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND AS TO THAT I CANNOT REMAIN AT CLAVERING
5933-73033-0019 IF I AM TOLD THAT I MAY NEVER HOPE THAT YOU WILL BECOME MY WIFE BUT MISTER SAUL
5933-73033-0020 NO THEY CANNOT BE ALL IMPORTANT AS REGARDS MY PRESENT HAPPINESS AND REST IN THIS WORLD THEY WILL BE SO OF COURSE I KNOW THAT NOTHING YOU CAN SAY OR DO WILL HURT ME BEYOND THAT
5933-73033-0021 BUT YOU MIGHT HELP ME EVEN TO THAT FURTHER AND GREATER BLISS YOU MIGHT HELP ME TOO IN THAT AS I ALSO MIGHT HELP YOU BUT MISTER SAUL SHE BEGAN AGAIN
5933-73033-0022 AND THEN FEELING THAT SHE MUST GO ON SHE FORCED HERSELF TO UTTER WORDS WHICH AT THE TIME SHE FELT TO BE COMMONPLACE PEOPLE CANNOT MARRY WITHOUT AN INCOME
5933-73033-0023 BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF THAT MIGHT I HOPE SHE VENTURED FOR AN INSTANT TO GLANCE AT HIS FACE AND SAW THAT HIS EYES WERE GLISTENING WITH A WONDERFUL BRIGHTNESS HOW CAN I ANSWER YOU FURTHER
5933-73033-0024 NO MISS CLAVERING IT IS NOT REASON ENOUGH IF YOU WERE TO TELL ME THAT YOU COULD NEVER LOVE ME ME PERSONALLY THAT YOU COULD NEVER REGARD ME WITH AFFECTION THAT WOULD BE REASON WHY I SHOULD DESIST WHY I SHOULD ABANDON ALL MY HOPE HERE
5933-73033-0025 AND GO AWAY FROM CLAVERING FOR EVER NOTHING ELSE CAN BE REASON ENOUGH MY BEING POOR OUGHT NOT TO MAKE YOU THROW ME ASIDE IF YOU LOVED ME
5933-73033-0026 LET ME BE EVER SO POOR I DO NOT LIKE YOU THE LESS BECAUSE YOU ARE POOR BUT DO YOU LIKE ME AT ALL CAN YOU BRING YOURSELF TO LOVE ME WOULD YOU MAKE THE EFFORT IF I HAD SUCH AN INCOME AS YOU THOUGHT NECESSARY
5933-73033-0027 I CALL UPON YOU TO ANSWER ME THAT QUESTION TRULY AND IF YOU TELL ME THAT IT COULD BE SO I WILL NOT DESPAIR AND I WILL NOT GO AWAY AS HE SAID THIS THEY CAME TO A TURN IN THE ROAD
5933-73033-0028 WHICH BROUGHT THE PARSONAGE GATE WITHIN THEIR VIEW FANNY KNEW THAT SHE WOULD LEAVE HIM THERE AND GO IN ALONE BUT SHE KNEW ALSO THAT SHE MUST SAY SOMETHING FURTHER TO HIM BEFORE SHE COULD THUS ESCAPE
5933-73033-0029 SHE DID NOT WISH TO GIVE HIM AN ASSURANCE OF HER POSITIVE INDIFFERENCE TO HIM AND STILL LESS DID SHE WISH TO TELL HIM THAT HE MIGHT HOPE IT COULD NOT BE POSSIBLE THAT SUCH AN ENGAGEMENT SHOULD BE APPROVED BY HER FATHER
5933-73033-0030 NOR COULD SHE BRING HERSELF TO THINK THAT SHE COULD BE QUITE CONTENTED WITH A LOVER SUCH AS MISTER SAUL WHEN HE HAD FIRST PROPOSED TO HER SHE HAD ALMOST RIDICULED HIS PROPOSITION IN HER HEART
5933-73033-0031 AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING IN IT ALSO THAT TOUCHED HER AS BEING SUBLIME THE MAN WAS HONEST GOOD AND TRUE PERHAPS THE BEST AND TRUEST MAN THAT SHE HAD EVER KNOWN
5933-73033-0032 SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SAY TO HIM ANY WORD THAT SHOULD BANISH HIM FOREVER FROM THE PLACE HE LOVED SO WELL IF YOU KNOW YOUR OWN HEART WELL ENOUGH TO ANSWER ME YOU SHOULD DO SO HE WENT ON TO SAY IF YOU DO NOT SAY SO
5933-73033-0033 AND I WILL BE CONTENT TO WAIT YOUR OWN TIME IT WOULD BE BETTER MISTER SAUL THAT YOU SHOULD NOT THINK OF THIS ANY MORE NO MISS CLAVERING THAT WOULD NOT BE BETTER NOT FOR ME FOR IT WOULD PROVE ME TO BE UTTERLY HEARTLESS
5933-73033-0034 BUT IT IS MY ONE GREAT HOPE AS REGARDS THIS WORLD THAT I SHOULD HAVE YOU AT SOME FUTURE DAY AS MY OWN IT MAY BE THAT I AM TOO PRONE TO HOPE BUT SURELY IF THAT WERE ALTOGETHER BEYOND HOPE
5933-73033-0035 THEY HAD NOW COME TO THE GATEWAY AND HE PAUSED AS SHE PUT HER TREMBLING HAND UPON THE LATCH
5933-73033-0036 THEN LET IT BE SO BUT MISS CLAVERING I SHALL NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE TILL YOU HAVE SAID MORE THAN THAT AND I WILL SPEAK THE TRUTH TO YOU EVEN THOUGH IT MAY OFFEND YOU I HAVE MORE OF HOPE NOW THAN I HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE
5933-73033-0037 MORE HOPE THAT YOU MAY POSSIBLY LEARN TO LOVE ME IN A FEW DAYS I WILL ASK YOU AGAIN WHETHER I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK UPON THE SUBJECT TO YOUR FATHER NOW I WILL SAY FAREWELL AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU
5933-73033-0038 AND REMEMBER THIS THAT MY ONLY EARTHLY WISH AND AMBITION IS IN YOUR HANDS THEN HE WENT ON HIS WAY TOWARD HIS OWN LODGINGS AND SHE ENTERED THE PARSONAGE GARDEN BY HERSELF
5933-73033-0039 WHAT SHOULD SHE NOW DO AND HOW SHOULD SHE CARRY HERSELF
5933-73033-0040 IN WHAT WAY SHOULD SHE ANSWER THAT QUESTION SHE COULD NOT TELL HERSELF THAT SHE LOVED MISTER SAUL AND YET IF SHE SURELY DID NOT LOVE HIM IF SUCH LOVE WERE IMPOSSIBLE WHY HAD SHE NOT SAID AS MUCH TO HIM
5933-73033-0041 WE HOWEVER MAY DECLARE THAT THAT INCLINATION TO RIDICULE HIS PASSION TO THINK OF HIM AS A MAN WHO HAD NO RIGHT TO LOVE WAS GONE FOREVER SHE CONCEDED TO HIM CLEARLY THAT RIGHT
5933-73033-0042 AND KNEW THAT HE HAD EXERCISED IT WELL SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS GOOD AND TRUE AND HONEST AND RECOGNIZED IN HIM ALSO MANLY COURAGE AND SPIRITED RESOLUTION SHE WOULD NOT TELL HERSELF THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD LOVE HIM
5933-73033-0043 DOUBTING UNHAPPY AND ILL AT EASE TO HAVE SUCH A SECRET LONG KEPT FROM HER MOTHER WOULD MAKE HER LIFE UNENDURABLE TO HER BUT SHE FELT THAT IN SPEAKING TO HER MOTHER ONLY ONE ASPECT OF THE AFFAIR WOULD BE POSSIBLE
