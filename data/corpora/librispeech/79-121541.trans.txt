79-121541-0008 BUT AS I SHOULD HAVE BURNED AND BAKED MYSELF MY TERROR OVERMASTERED MY GOOD WILL WHICH MADE ME GREEDY OF EMBRACING THEM THEN I BEGAN SORROW AND NOT DISDAIN DID YOUR CONDITION FIX WITHIN ME SO THAT TARDILY IT WHOLLY IS STRIPPED OFF
79-121541-0009 AS SOON AS THIS MY LORD SAID UNTO ME WORDS ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH I THOUGHT WITHIN ME THAT PEOPLE SUCH AS YOU ARE WERE APPROACHING I OF YOUR CITY AM AND EVERMORE YOUR LABOURS AND YOUR HONOURABLE NAMES I WITH AFFECTION HAVE RETRACED AND HEARD
79-121541-0010 I LEAVE THE GALL AND GO FOR THE SWEET FRUITS PROMISED TO ME BY THE VERACIOUS LEADER BUT TO THE CENTRE FIRST I NEEDS MUST PLUNGE SO MAY THE SOUL FOR A LONG WHILE CONDUCT THOSE LIMBS OF THINE DID HE MAKE ANSWER THEN

79-121541-0015 THEN THEY BROKE UP THE WHEEL AND IN THEIR FLIGHT IT SEEMED AS IF THEIR AGILE LEGS WERE WINGS NOT AN AMEN COULD POSSIBLY BE SAID SO RAPIDLY AS THEY HAD DISAPPEARED WHEREFORE THE MASTER DEEMED BEST TO DEPART
79-121541-0016 I FOLLOWED HIM AND LITTLE HAD WE GONE BEFORE THE SOUND OF WATER WAS SO NEAR US THAT SPEAKING WE SHOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN HEARD EVEN AS THAT STREAM WHICH HOLDETH ITS OWN COURSE THE FIRST FROM MONTE VESO TOW'RDS THE EAST
79-121541-0017 WHICH IS ABOVE CALLED ACQUACHETA ERE IT DOWN DESCENDETH INTO ITS LOW BED AND AT FORLI IS VACANT OF THAT NAME REVERBERATES THERE ABOVE SAN BENEDETTO FROM ALPS BY FALLING AT A SINGLE LEAP WHERE FOR A THOUSAND THERE WERE ROOM ENOUGH
79-121541-0018 AFTER I THIS HAD ALL FROM ME UNLOOSED AS MY CONDUCTOR HAD COMMANDED ME I REACHED IT TO HIM GATHERED UP AND COILED WHEREAT HE TURNED HIMSELF TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE VERGE HE CAST IT DOWN INTO THAT DEEP ABYSS
79-121541-0019 IT MUST NEEDS BE SOME NOVELTY RESPOND I SAID WITHIN MYSELF TO THE NEW SIGNAL THE MASTER WITH HIS EYE IS FOLLOWING SO AH ME HOW VERY CAUTIOUS MEN SHOULD BE WITH THOSE WHO NOT ALONE BEHOLD THE ACT BUT WITH THEIR WISDOM LOOK INTO THE THOUGHTS
79-121541-0020 HE SAID TO ME SOON THERE WILL UPWARD COME WHAT I AWAIT AND WHAT THY THOUGHT IS DREAMING MUST SOON REVEAL ITSELF UNTO THY SIGHT
79-121541-0021 A MAN SHOULD CLOSE HIS LIPS AS FAR AS MAY BE BECAUSE WITHOUT HIS FAULT IT CAUSES SHAME BUT HERE I CANNOT AND READER BY THE NOTES OF THIS MY COMEDY TO THEE I SWEAR SO MAY THEY NOT BE VOID OF LASTING FAVOUR ATHWART THAT DENSE AND DARKSOME ATMOSPHERE
79-121541-0022 BUT ON THE BORDER DID NOT DRAG ITS TAIL THE FACE WAS AS THE FACE OF A JUST MAN ITS SEMBLANCE OUTWARDLY WAS SO BENIGN AND OF A SERPENT ALL THE TRUNK BESIDE TWO PAWS IT HAD HAIRY UNTO THE ARMPITS
79-121541-0023 THE BACK AND BREAST AND BOTH THE SIDES IT HAD DEPICTED O'ER WITH NOOSES AND WITH SHIELDS WITH COLOURS MORE GROUNDWORK OR BROIDERY NEVER IN CLOTH DID TARTARS MAKE NOR TURKS NOR WERE SUCH TISSUES BY ARACHNE LAID
79-121541-0024 AS SOMETIMES WHERRIES LIE UPON THE SHORE THAT PART ARE IN THE WATER PART ON LAND AND AS AMONG THE GUZZLING GERMANS THERE THE BEAVER PLANTS HIMSELF TO WAGE HIS WAR SO THAT VILE MONSTER LAY UPON THE BORDER WHICH IS OF STONE AND SHUTTETH IN THE SAND
79-121541-0025 HIS TAIL WAS WHOLLY QUIVERING IN THE VOID CONTORTING UPWARDS THE ENVENOMED FORK THAT IN THE GUISE OF SCORPION ARMED ITS POINT THE GUIDE SAID NOW PERFORCE MUST TURN ASIDE OUR WAY A LITTLE
79-121541-0026 WE THEREFORE ON THE RIGHT SIDE DESCENDED AND MADE TEN STEPS UPON THE OUTER VERGE COMPLETELY TO AVOID THE SAND AND FLAME AND AFTER WE ARE COME TO HIM I SEE A LITTLE FARTHER OFF UPON THE SAND A PEOPLE SITTING NEAR THE HOLLOW PLACE
79-121541-0027 THEN SAID TO ME THE MASTER SO THAT FULL EXPERIENCE OF THIS ROUND THOU BEAR AWAY NOW GO AND SEE WHAT THEIR CONDITION IS THERE LET THY CONVERSATION BE CONCISE TILL THOU RETURNEST I WILL SPEAK WITH HIM THAT HE CONCEDE TO US HIS STALWART SHOULDERS
79-121541-0028 THUS FARTHER STILL UPON THE OUTERMOST HEAD OF THAT SEVENTH CIRCLE ALL ALONE I WENT WHERE SAT THE MELANCHOLY FOLK OUT OF THEIR EYES WAS GUSHING FORTH THEIR WOE THIS WAY THAT WAY THEY HELPED THEM WITH THEIR HANDS NOW FROM THE FLAMES AND NOW FROM THE HOT SOIL
79-121541-0029 NOT OTHERWISE IN SUMMER DO THE DOGS NOW WITH THE FOOT NOW WITH THE MUZZLE WHEN BY FLEAS OR FLIES OR GADFLIES THEY ARE BITTEN WHEN I HAD TURNED MINE EYES UPON THE FACES OF SOME ON WHOM THE DOLOROUS FIRE IS FALLING NOT ONE OF THEM I KNEW
79-121541-0030 BUT I PERCEIVED THAT FROM THE NECK OF EACH THERE HUNG A POUCH WHICH CERTAIN COLOUR HAD AND CERTAIN BLAZON AND THEREUPON IT SEEMS THEIR EYES ARE FEEDING AND AS I GAZING ROUND ME COME AMONG THEM UPON A YELLOW POUCH I AZURE SAW THAT HAD THE FACE AND POSTURE OF A LION
79-121541-0031 PROCEEDING THEN THE CURRENT OF MY SIGHT ANOTHER OF THEM SAW I RED AS BLOOD DISPLAY A GOOSE MORE WHITE THAN BUTTER IS AND ONE WHO WITH AN AZURE SOW AND GRAVID EMBLAZONED HAD HIS LITTLE POUCH OF WHITE SAID UNTO ME WHAT DOST THOU IN THIS MOAT
79-121541-0032 NOW GET THEE GONE AND SINCE THOU'RT STILL ALIVE KNOW THAT A NEIGHBOUR OF MINE VITALIANO WILL HAVE HIS SEAT HERE ON MY LEFT HAND SIDE A PADUAN AM I WITH THESE FLORENTINES FULL MANY A TIME THEY THUNDER IN MINE EARS EXCLAIMING COME THE SOVEREIGN CAVALIER
79-121541-0033 HE WHO SHALL BRING THE SATCHEL WITH THREE GOATS THEN TWISTED HE HIS MOUTH AND FORTH HE THRUST HIS TONGUE LIKE TO AN OX THAT LICKS ITS NOSE AND FEARING LEST MY LONGER STAY MIGHT VEX HIM WHO HAD WARNED ME NOT TO TARRY LONG BACKWARD I TURNED ME FROM THOSE WEARY SOULS
79-121541-0034 I FOUND MY GUIDE WHO HAD ALREADY MOUNTED UPON THE BACK OF THAT WILD ANIMAL AND SAID TO ME NOW BE BOTH STRONG AND BOLD NOW WE DESCEND BY STAIRWAYS SUCH AS THESE MOUNT THOU IN FRONT FOR I WILL BE MIDWAY SO THAT THE TAIL MAY HAVE NO POWER TO HARM THEE
79-121541-0035 EVEN SUCH BECAME I AT THOSE PROFFERED WORDS BUT SHAME IN ME HIS MENACES PRODUCED WHICH MAKETH SERVANT STRONG BEFORE GOOD MASTER I SEATED ME UPON THOSE MONSTROUS SHOULDERS I WISHED TO SAY AND YET THE VOICE CAME NOT AS I BELIEVED
79-121541-0036 TAKE HEED THAT THOU EMBRACE ME BUT HE WHO OTHER TIMES HAD RESCUED ME IN OTHER PERIL SOON AS I HAD MOUNTED WITHIN HIS ARMS ENCIRCLED AND SUSTAINED ME
79-121541-0037 THE CIRCLES LARGE AND THE DESCENT BE LITTLE THINK OF THE NOVEL BURDEN WHICH THOU HAST EVEN AS THE LITTLE VESSEL SHOVES FROM SHORE BACKWARD STILL BACKWARD SO HE THENCE WITHDREW AND WHEN HE WHOLLY FELT HIMSELF AFLOAT THERE WHERE HIS BREAST HAD BEEN HE TURNED HIS TAIL
79-121541-0038 AND THAT EXTENDED LIKE AN EEL HE MOVED AND WITH HIS PAWS DREW TO HIMSELF THE AIR A GREATER FEAR I DO NOT THINK THERE WAS WHAT TIME ABANDONED PHAETON THE REINS WHEREBY THE HEAVENS AS STILL APPEARS WERE SCORCHED
79-121541-0039 NOR WHEN THE WRETCHED ICARUS HIS FLANKS FELT STRIPPED OF FEATHERS BY THE MELTING WAX
79-121541-0040 BUT I PERCEIVE IT ONLY BY WIND UPON MY FACE AND FROM BELOW I HEARD ALREADY ON THE RIGHT THE WHIRLPOOL MAKING A HORRIBLE CRASHING UNDER US WHENCE I THRUST OUT MY HEAD WITH EYES CAST DOWNWARD THEN WAS I STILL MORE FEARFUL OF THE ABYSS
79-121541-0041 BECAUSE I FIRES BEHELD AND HEARD LAMENTS WHEREAT I TREMBLING ALL THE CLOSER CLING I SAW THEN FOR BEFORE I HAD NOT SEEN IT THE TURNING AND DESCENDING BY GREAT HORRORS THAT WERE APPROACHING UPON DIVERS SIDES

79-121541-0043 AND AS ABOUT SUCH STRONGHOLDS FROM THEIR GATES UNTO THE OUTER BANK ARE LITTLE BRIDGES SO FROM THE PRECIPICE'S BASE DID CRAGS PROJECT WHICH INTERSECTED DIKES AND MOATS UNTO THE WELL THAT TRUNCATES AND COLLECTS THEM
79-121541-0044 WITHIN THIS PLACE DOWN SHAKEN FROM THE BACK OF GERYON WE FOUND US AND THE POET HELD TO THE LEFT AND I MOVED ON BEHIND UPON MY RIGHT HAND I BEHELD NEW ANGUISH NEW TORMENTS AND NEW WIELDERS OF THE LASH WHEREWITH THE FOREMOST BOLGIA WAS REPLETE
79-121541-0045 DOWN AT THE BOTTOM WERE THE SINNERS NAKED THIS SIDE THE MIDDLE CAME THEY FACING US BEYOND IT WITH US BUT WITH GREATER STEPS EVEN AS THE ROMANS FOR THE MIGHTY HOST THE YEAR OF JUBILEE UPON THE BRIDGE HAVE CHOSEN A MODE TO PASS THE PEOPLE OVER
79-121541-0046 FOR ALL UPON ONE SIDE TOWARDS THE CASTLE THEIR FACES HAVE AND GO UNTO SAINT PETER'S ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY GO TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN THIS SIDE AND THAT ALONG THE LIVID STONE BEHELD I HORNED DEMONS WITH GREAT SCOURGES

79-121541-0087 THEREFORE WITH BOTH HIS ARMS HE TOOK ME UP AND WHEN HE HAD ME ALL UPON HIS BREAST REMOUNTED BY THE WAY WHERE HE DESCENDED NOR DID HE TIRE TO HAVE ME CLASPED TO HIM BUT BORE ME TO THE SUMMIT OF THE ARCH WHICH FROM THE FOURTH DIKE TO THE FIFTH IS PASSAGE
79-121541-0088 THERE TENDERLY HE LAID HIS BURDEN DOWN TENDERLY ON THE CRAG UNEVEN AND STEEP THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD PASSAGE FOR THE GOATS THENCE WAS UNVEILED TO ME ANOTHER VALLEY
79-121541-0089 OF THE FIRST SONG WHICH IS OF THE SUBMERGED I WAS ALREADY THOROUGHLY DISPOSED TO PEER DOWN INTO THE UNCOVERED DEPTH WHICH BATHED ITSELF WITH TEARS OF AGONY AND PEOPLE SAW I THROUGH THE CIRCULAR VALLEY SILENT AND WEEPING
79-121541-0090 COMING AT THE PACE WHICH IN THIS WORLD THE LITANIES ASSUME AS LOWER DOWN MY SIGHT DESCENDED ON THEM WONDROUSLY EACH ONE SEEMED TO BE DISTORTED FROM CHIN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CHEST FOR TOW'RDS THE REINS THE COUNTENANCE WAS TURNED
79-121541-0091 AS TO LOOK FORWARD HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM PERCHANCE INDEED BY VIOLENCE OF PALSY SOME ONE HAS BEEN THUS WHOLLY TURNED AWRY BUT I NE'ER SAW IT NOR BELIEVE IT CAN BE AS GOD MAY LET THEE READER GATHER FRUIT FROM THIS THY READING
79-121541-0092 THINK NOW FOR THYSELF HOW I COULD EVER KEEP MY FACE UNMOISTENED WHEN OUR OWN IMAGE NEAR ME I BEHELD DISTORTED SO THE WEEPING OF THE EYES ALONG THE FISSURE BATHED THE HINDER PARTS TRULY I WEPT LEANING UPON A PEAK OF THE HARD CRAG
79-121541-0093 SO THAT MY ESCORT SAID TO ME ART THOU TOO OF THE OTHER FOOLS HERE PITY LIVES WHEN IT IS WHOLLY DEAD
79-121541-0094 WHO FEELS COMPASSION AT THE DOOM DIVINE LIFT UP LIFT UP THY HEAD AND SEE FOR WHOM OPENED THE EARTH BEFORE THE THEBANS EYES WHEREFORE THEY ALL CRIED WHITHER RUSHEST THOU AMPHIARAUS WHY DOST LEAVE THE WAR

79-121541-0096 WHEN FROM A MALE A FEMALE HE BECAME HIS MEMBERS BEING ALL OF THEM TRANSFORMED AND AFTERWARDS WAS FORCED TO STRIKE ONCE MORE THE TWO ENTANGLED SERPENTS WITH HIS ROD ERE HE COULD HAVE AGAIN HIS MANLY PLUMES
79-121541-0097 THAT ARUNS IS WHO BACKS THE OTHER'S BELLY WHO IN THE HILLS OF LUNI
