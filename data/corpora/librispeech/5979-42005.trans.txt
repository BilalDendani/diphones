5979-42005-0000 HE WAS IN THAT STATE OF NERVOUS PROSTRATION WHICH SO OFTEN FOLLOWS PROTRACTED BUT FRUITLESS EFFORTS HE HAD SCARCELY STRENGTH ENOUGH TO BATHE HIS BURNING FOREHEAD AND GLEAMING EYES WITH COOL REFRESHING WATER
5979-42005-0001 THIS FRIGHTFUL EXAMINATION HAD LASTED NO LESS THAN SEVEN CONSECUTIVE HOURS THE SMILING CLERK WHO HAD KEPT HIS PLACE AT HIS DESK BUSILY WRITING THE WHOLE WHILE NOW ROSE TO HIS FEET
5979-42005-0002 GLAD OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO STRETCH HIS LIMBS AND SNAP HIS FINGERS CRAMPED BY HOLDING THE PEN STILL HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST DEGREE BORED
5979-42005-0003 THAT WERE DAILY ENACTED IN HIS PRESENCE
5979-42005-0004 OWING TO THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SHROUDED THE FINISH OF THE FINAL ACT A FINISH THAT ONLY TOO OFTEN BELIED THE ORDINARY RULES AND DEDUCTIONS OF WRITERS FOR THE STAGE WHAT A KNAVE HE EXCLAIMED
5979-42005-0005 HE SOMETIMES EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO CONSULT HIM DOUBTLESS SOMEWHAT IN THE SAME STYLE THAT MOLIERE CONSULTED HIS SERVANT BUT ON THIS OCCASION HE DID NOT ACCEPT HIS OPINION NO
5979-42005-0006 AH HE'S A MAN OF WONDERFUL POWER OBSERVED LECOQ THE DETECTIVE WAS SINCERE IN HIS PRAISE ALTHOUGH THE PRISONER HAD DISAPPOINTED HIS PLANS AND HAD EVEN INSULTED HIM
5979-42005-0007 AND HE HOPED TO CONQUER IN THE END NEVERTHELESS IN HIS SECRET SOUL HE FELT FOR HIS ADVERSARY ADMIRING THAT SYMPATHY WHICH A FOEMAN WORTHY OF ONE'S STEEL ALWAYS INSPIRES
5979-42005-0008 WHAT COOLNESS WHAT COURAGE CONTINUED THE YOUNG DETECTIVE AH THERE'S NO DENYING IT HIS SYSTEM OF DEFENSE OF ABSOLUTE DENIAL IS A MASTERPIECE IT IS PERFECT
5979-42005-0009 AT TIMES I COULD SCARCELY RESTRAIN MY ADMIRATION WHAT IS A FAMOUS COMEDIAN BESIDE THAT FELLOW THE GREATEST ACTORS NEED THE ADJUNCT OF STAGE SCENERY TO SUPPORT THE ILLUSION WHEREAS THIS MAN ENTIRELY UNAIDED
5979-42005-0010 ALMOST CONVINCED ME EVEN AGAINST MY REASON DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR VERY APPROPRIATE CRITICISM PROVES INQUIRED THE MAGISTRATE I AM LISTENING SIR AH WELL
5979-42005-0011 IT IS ONLY IN THE LOWEST OR IN THE HIGHEST RANKS THAT YOU ENCOUNTER SUCH GRIM ENERGY AS HE HAS DISPLAYED SUCH SCORN OF LIFE AS WELL AS SUCH REMARKABLE PRESENCE OF MIND AND RESOLUTION
5979-42005-0012 WOULD HAVE CONFESSED IT LONG AGO BUT SIR THIS MAN IS SURELY NOT THE BUFFOON MAY REPLIED THE YOUNG DETECTIVE NO CERTAINLY NOT
5979-42005-0013 WE MUST THEREFORE DECIDE UPON SOME PLAN OF ACTION HE SMILED KINDLY AND ADDED IN A FRIENDLY VOICE IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO TELL YOU THAT MONSIEUR LECOQ QUITE UNNECESSARY
5979-42005-0014 SINCE TO YOU BELONGS THE HONOR OF HAVING DETECTED THIS FRAUD AS FOR MYSELF I CONFESS THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN WARNED IN ADVANCE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE DUPE OF THIS CLEVER ARTIST'S TALENT THE YOUNG DETECTIVE BOWED
5979-42005-0015 BUT A GLEAM OF PLEASED VANITY SPARKLED IN HIS EYES WHAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS FRIENDLY BENEVOLENT MAGISTRATE
5979-42005-0016 SO TACITURN AND HAUGHTY THIS MAN AT LEAST UNDERSTOOD APPRECIATED AND ENCOURAGED HIM AND IT WAS WITH A COMMON THEORY AND AN EQUAL ARDOR THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO A SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH
5979-42005-0017 AND THAT SUCCESS WAS STILL EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL WITH THIS CHILLING CONCLUSION PRESENCE OF MIND RETURNED TURNING TOWARD THE MAGISTRATE HE EXCLAIMED YOU WILL RECOLLECT SIR
5979-42005-0018 THAT THE WIDOW CHUPIN MENTIONED A SON OF HERS A CERTAIN POLYTE YES WHY NOT QUESTION HIM
5979-42005-0019 AND MIGHT PERHAPS GIVE US VALUABLE INFORMATION REGARDING GUSTAVE LACHENEUR AND THE MURDERER HIMSELF AS HE IS NOT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HE HAS PROBABLY HEARD OF HIS MOTHER'S ARREST BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IMPOSSIBLE
5979-42005-0020 THAT HE SHOULD SUSPECT OUR PRESENT PERPLEXITY AH YOU ARE A HUNDRED TIMES RIGHT EXCLAIMED THE MAGISTRATE I OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT MYSELF IN HIS POSITION HE CAN SCARCELY HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH AS YET
5979-42005-0021 AND I'LL HAVE HIM UP HERE TO MORROW MORNING I WILL ALSO QUESTION HIS WIFE
5979-42005-0022 PREPARE A SUMMONS IN THE NAME OF THE WIFE OF HIPPOLYTE CHUPIN AND ADDRESS AN ORDER TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPOT TO PRODUCE HER HUSBAND BUT NIGHT WAS COMING ON IT WAS ALREADY TOO DARK TO SEE TO WRITE
5979-42005-0023 AND ACCORDINGLY THE CLERK RANG THE BELL FOR LIGHTS JUST AS THE MESSENGER WHO BROUGHT THE LAMPS TURNED TO LEAVE THE ROOM A RAP WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPOT ENTERED
5979-42005-0024 DURING THE PAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THIS WORTHY FUNCTIONARY HAD BEEN GREATLY PERPLEXED CONCERNING THE MYSTERIOUS PRISONER
5979-42005-0025 AND HE NOW CAME TO THE MAGISTRATE FOR ADVICE REGARDING HIM I COME TO ASK SAID HE IF I AM STILL TO RETAIN THE PRISONER MAY IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT YES
5979-42005-0026 ALTHOUGH I FEAR FRESH ATTACKS OF FRENZY I DISLIKE TO CONFINE HIM IN THE STRAIT JACKET AGAIN LEAVE HIM FREE IN HIS CELL
5979-42005-0027 AND TELL THE KEEPERS TO WATCH HIM WELL BUT TO TREAT HIM KINDLY
5979-42005-0028 ACCUSED PARTIES ARE PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT THE INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE IS ALLOWED TO ADOPT SUCH MEASURES CONCERNING THEM AS HE MAY DEEM NECESSARY FOR THE INTEREST OF THE PROSECUTION
5979-42005-0029 AND THEN ADDED YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING THE PRISONER'S IDENTITY UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT THE GOVERNOR SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A KNOWING AIR IN THAT CASE SAID HE
5979-42005-0030 MY CONJECTURES WERE CORRECT IT SEEMS TO ME EVIDENT THAT THIS MAN IS A CRIMINAL OF THE WORST DESCRIPTION AN OLD OFFENDER CERTAINLY AND ONE WHO HAS THE STRONGEST INTEREST IN CONCEALING HIS IDENTITY
5979-42005-0031 YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH A MAN
5979-42005-0032 AND WHO HAS MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM CAYENNE PERHAPS YOU ARE MISTAKEN HUM I SHALL BE GREATLY SURPRISED IF SUCH SHOULD PROVE THE CASE I MUST ADMIT
5979-42005-0033 THE MOST EXPERIENCED AND THE MOST SKILFUL OF OUR INSPECTORS I AGREE WITH HIM IN THINKING THAT YOUNG DETECTIVES ARE OFTEN OVERZEALOUS AND RUN AFTER FANTOMS ORIGINATED IN THEIR OWN BRAINS LECOQ
5979-42005-0034 WAS ABOUT TO MAKE AN ANGRY RESPONSE
5979-42005-0035 THEN WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE THE MAGISTRATE REPLIED TO THE GOVERNOR UPON MY WORD MY DEAR FRIEND HE SAID THE MORE I STUDY THIS AFFAIR THE MORE CONVINCED I AM OF THE CORRECTNESS OF THE THEORY ADVANCED BY THE
5979-42005-0036 BUT AFTER ALL I AM NOT INFALLIBLE AND I SHALL DEPEND UPON YOUR COUNSEL AND ASSISTANCE OH I HAVE MEANS OF VERIFYING MY ASSERTION INTERRUPTED THE GOVERNOR
5979-42005-0037 EITHER BY THE POLICE OR BY ONE OF HIS FELLOW PRISONERS WITH THESE WORDS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE SCARCELY HAD HE DONE SO THAN LECOQ SPRANG TO HIS FEET THE YOUNG DETECTIVE WAS FURIOUS
5979-42005-0038 YOU SEE THAT GEVROL ALREADY SPEAKS ILL OF ME HE IS JEALOUS AH WELL WHAT DOES THAT MATTER TO YOU IF YOU SUCCEED YOU WILL HAVE YOUR REVENGE IF YOU ARE MISTAKEN THEN I AM MISTAKEN TOO
5979-42005-0039 HE ALSO PLACED IN HIS HANDS THE DIAMOND EARRING THE OWNER OF WHICH MUST BE DISCOVERED AND THE LETTER SIGNED LACHENEUR WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE POCKET OF THE SPURIOUS SOLDIER
