4034-14942-0000 THE FACT IS THE DISEASE CAME TO US WITH A BAD NAME FOR THE FRENCH THEMSELVES DEEMED IT INCURABLE IN THIS COUNTRY THE OLD FASHIONED PLAN OF TREATMENT WAS WONT TO BE THE USUAL ROUGH REMEDIES EMETICS PURGATIVES
4034-14942-0001 DISTEMPER HAS A CERTAIN COURSE TO RUN AND IN THIS DISEASE NATURE SEEMS TO ATTEMPT THE ELIMINATION OF THE POISON THROUGH THE SECRETIONS THROWN OUT
4034-14942-0002 OUR CHIEF DIFFICULTY IN THE TREATMENT OF DISTEMPER LIES IN THE COMPLICATIONS THEREOF WE MAY AND OFTEN DO HAVE THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION ATTACKED WE HAVE SOMETIMES CONGESTION OF THE LIVER
4034-14942-0003 OR WHETHER THE POISON FLOATS TO THE KENNEL ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND OR IS CARRIED THERE ON A SHOE OR THE POINT OF A WALKING STICK THE FOLLOWING FACTS OUGHT TO BE BORNE IN MIND ONE ANYTHING THAT DEBILITATES THE BODY OR WEAKENS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
4034-14942-0004 PAVES THE WAY FOR THE DISTEMPER POISON TWO THE HEALTHIER THE DOG THE MORE POWER DOES HE POSSESS TO RESIST CONTAGION THREE WHEN THE DISEASE IS EPIZOOTIC IT CAN OFTEN BE KEPT AT BAY BY PROPER ATTENTION TO DIET AND EXERCISE
4034-14942-0005 FREQUENT CHANGE OF KENNEL STRAW AND PERFECT CLEANLINESS FOUR THE PREDISPOSING CAUSES WHICH HAVE COME MORE IMMEDIATELY UNDER MY NOTICE ARE DEBILITY COLD DAMP STARVATION FILTHY KENNELS
4034-14942-0006 UNWHOLESOME FOOD IMPURE AIR AND GRIEF THE AGE AT WHICH DOGS TAKE DISTEMPER THEY MAY TAKE DISTEMPER AT ANY AGE THE MOST COMMON TIME OF LIFE IS FROM THE FIFTH TILL THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH MONTH
4034-14942-0007 SYMPTOMS THERE IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A PERIOD OF LATENCY OR OF INCUBATION IN WHICH THERE IS MORE OR LESS OF DULLNESS AND LOSS OF APPETITE AND THIS GLIDES GRADUALLY INTO A STATE OF FEVERISHNESS
4034-14942-0008 SOMETIMES THE BOWELS ARE AT FIRST CONSTIPATED BUT THEY ARE MORE USUALLY IRREGULAR SNEEZING WILL ALSO BE FREQUENT AND IN SOME CASES COUGH DRY AND HUSKY AT FIRST THE TEMPERATURE SHOULD BE TAKEN
4034-14942-0009 AND IF THERE IS A RISE OF TWO OR THREE DEGREES THE CASE SHOULD BE TREATED AS DISTEMPER AND NOT AS A COMMON COLD AT THE COMMENCEMENT THERE IS BUT LITTLE EXUDATION FROM THE EYES AND NOSE BUT AS THE DISEASE ADVANCES THIS SYMPTOM WILL BECOME MORE MARKED
4034-14942-0010 BEING CLEAR AT FIRST SO TOO WILL ANOTHER SYMPTOM WHICH IS PARTIALLY DIAGNOSTIC OF THE MALADY NAMELY INCREASED HEAT OF BODY COMBINED WITH A RAPID FALLING OFF IN FLESH SOMETIMES INDEED PROCEEDING QUICKLY ON TO POSITIVE EMACIATION
4034-14942-0011 AS THE DISEASE CREEPS DOWNWARDS AND INWARDS ALONG THE AIR PASSAGES THE CHEST GETS MORE AND MORE AFFECTED THE DISCHARGE OF MUCUS AND PUS FROM THE NOSTRILS MORE ABUNDANT AND THE COUGH LOSES ITS DRY CHARACTER BECOMING MOIST
4034-14942-0012 THE DISCHARGE FROM THE EYES IS SIMPLY MUCUS AND PUS BUT IF NOT CONSTANTLY DRIED AWAY WILL GUM THE INFLAMED LIDS TOGETHER THAT FROM THE NOSTRILS IS NOT ONLY PURULENT BUT OFTEN MIXED WITH DARK BLOOD THE APPETITE IS NOW CLEAN GONE
4034-14942-0013 AND THERE IS OFTEN VOMITING AND OCCASIONAL ATTACKS OF DIARRHOEA NOW IN MILD CASES WE MAY LOOK FOR SOME ABATEMENT OF THE SYMPTOMS ABOUT THE FOURTEENTH DAY THE FEVER GETS LESS
4034-14942-0014 IF THE LIVER BECOMES INVOLVED WE SHALL VERY SOON HAVE THE JAUNDICED EYE AND THE YELLOW SKIN DIARRHOEA IS ANOTHER VERY COMMON COMPLICATION WE HAVE FREQUENT PURGING AND MAYBE SICKNESS AND VOMITING
4034-14942-0015 OWING NO DOUBT TO DEGENERATION OF THE NERVE CENTRES CAUSED BY BLOOD POISONING THERE ARE MANY OTHER COMPLICATIONS AND SKIN COMPLAINTS ARE COMMON AFTER IT TREATMENT
4034-14942-0016 WE SHOULD NOT LOSE AN HOUR IF HE BE AN INDOOR DOG FIND HIM A GOOD BED IN A CLEAN WELL VENTILATED APARTMENT FREE FROM LUMBER AND FREE FROM DIRT IF IT BE SUMMER HAVE ALL THE WINDOWS OUT OR OPENED IF WINTER
4034-14942-0017 A LITTLE FIRE WILL BE NECESSARY BUT HAVE HALF THE WINDOW OPENED AT THE SAME TIME ONLY TAKE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST HIS LYING IN A DRAUGHT FRESH AIR IN CASES OF DISTEMPER AND INDEED IN FEVERS OF ALL KINDS CANNOT BE TOO HIGHLY EXTOLLED
4034-14942-0018 THE MORE REST THE DOG HAS THE BETTER HE MUST BE KEPT FREE FROM EXCITEMENT
4034-14942-0019 ON THE NEXT DAY BEGIN WITH A MIXTURE SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING SOLUTION OF ACETATE OF AMMONIA THIRTY DROPS TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SWEET SPIRITS OF NITRE FIFTEEN DROPS TO SIXTY SALICYLATE OF SODA TWO GRAINS TO TEN
4034-14942-0020 TEN DROPS TO SIXTY SWEET SPIRITS OF NITRE TEN DROPS TO SIXTY IN CAMPHOR WATER A FEW DROPS OF DILUTE HYDROCHLORIC ACID SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE DOG'S DRINK AND TWO TEASPOONFULS TO A QUART OF WATER
4034-14942-0021 OF THE CHLORATE OF POTASH THIS MAKES AN EXCELLENT FEVER DRINK ESPECIALLY IF THE DOG CAN BE GOT TO TAKE DECOCTION OF BARLEY BARLEY WATER INSTEAD OF PLAIN COLD WATER BEST MADE OF KEEN AND ROBINSON'S PATENT BARLEY
4034-14942-0022 IF THERE BE PERSISTENT SICKNESS AND VOMITING THE MEDICINE MUST BE STOPPED FOR A TIME SMALL BOLUSES OF ICE FREQUENTLY ADMINISTERED WILL DO MUCH GOOD AND DOSES OF DILUTE PRUSSIC ACID FROM ONE TO FOUR DROPS IN A LITTLE WATER
4034-14942-0023 WILL GENERALLY ARREST THE VOMITING IF CONSTIPATION BE PRESENT WE MUST USE NO ROUGH REMEDIES TO GET RID OF IT A LITTLE RAW MEAT CUT INTO SMALL PIECES MINCED IN FACT OR A SMALL PORTION OF RAW LIVER MAY BE GIVEN IF THERE BE LITTLE FEVER
4034-14942-0024 IF THERE BE FEVER WE ARE TO TRUST FOR A TIME TO INJECTIONS OF PLAIN SOAP AND WATER DIARRHOEA ALTHOUGH OFTEN A TROUBLESOME SYMPTOM IS IT MUST BE REMEMBERED A SALUTARY ONE UNLESS THEREFORE IT BECOMES EXCESSIVE
4034-14942-0025 DO NOT INTERFERE IF IT DOES GIVE THE SIMPLE CHALK MIXTURE THREE TIMES A DAY BUT NO LONGER THAN IS NEEDFUL THE DISCHARGE FROM THE MOUTH AND NOSE IS TO BE WIPED AWAY WITH A SOFT RAG OR BETTER STILL SOME TOW
4034-14942-0026 WHICH IS AFTERWARDS TO BE BURNED WETTED WITH A WEAK SOLUTION OF CARBOLIC THE FOREHEAD EYES AND NOSE MAY BE FOMENTED TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY
4034-14942-0027 IT IS NOT JUDICIOUS TO WET A LONG HAIRED DOG MUCH BUT A SHORT HAIRED ONE MAY HAVE THE CHEST AND THROAT WELL FOMENTED SEVERAL TIMES A DAY AND WELL RUBBED DRY AFTERWARDS
4034-14942-0028 THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXCELLENT TONIC SULPHATE OF QUININE ONE EIGHTH TO THREE GRAINS POWDERED RHUBARB TWO TO TEN GRAINS EXTRACT OF TARAXACUM THREE TO TWENTY GRAINS
4034-14942-0029 MODERATE EXERCISE FRESH AIR AND PROTECTION FROM COLD
4034-14942-0030 THE MOST PROMINENT SYMPTOM PERHAPS IS THE FREQUENT COUGH IT IS AT FIRST DRY RINGING AND EVIDENTLY PAINFUL IN A FEW DAYS HOWEVER OR SOONER IT SOFTENS AND THERE IS A DISCHARGE OF FROTHY MUCUS WITH IT
4034-14942-0031 AND IN THE LATTER STAGES OF PUS AND ROPY MUCUS TREATMENT KEEP THE PATIENT IN A COMFORTABLE WELL VENTILATED APARTMENT WITH FREE ACCESS IN AND OUT IF THE WEATHER BE DRY LET THE BOWELS BE FREELY ACTED UPON TO BEGIN WITH
4034-14942-0032 BUT NO WEAKENING DISCHARGE FROM THE BOWELS MUST BE KEPT UP AFTER THE BOWELS HAVE BEEN MOVED WE SHOULD COMMENCE THE EXHIBITION OF SMALL DOSES OF TARTAR EMETIC WITH SQUILLS AND OPIUM THRICE A DAY IF THE COUGH IS VERY TROUBLESOME
4034-14942-0033 GIVE THIS MIXTURE TINCTURE OF SQUILLS FIVE DROPS TO THIRTY PAREGORIC TEN DROPS TO SIXTY TARTAR EMETIC ONE SIXTEENTH OF A GRAIN TO ONE GRAIN SYRUP AND WATER A SUFFICIENCY THRICE DAILY
4034-14942-0034 WE MAY GIVE A FULL DOSE OF OPIUM EVERY NIGHT IN MILD CASES CARBONATE OF AMMONIA MAY BE TRIED IT OFTEN DOES GOOD THE DOSE BEING FROM TWO GRAINS TO TEN IN CAMPHOR WATER OR EVEN PLAIN WATER
4034-14942-0035 A FEW DROPS TO A TEASPOONFUL OF PAREGORIC GIVEN AT NIGHT WILL DO GOOD AND THE BOWELS SHOULD BE KEPT REGULAR AND A SIMPLE LAXATIVE PILL GIVEN NOW AND THEN
4034-14942-0036 TO TEN YEARS IT IS OFTEN SYMPTOMATIC OF OTHER AILMENTS CAUSES VERY NUMEROUS IN WEAKLY DOGS EXPOSURE ALONE WILL PRODUCE IT THE WEATHER TOO HAS NO DOUBT MUCH TO DO WITH THE PRODUCTION OF DIARRHOEA
4034-14942-0037 IN MOST KENNELS IT IS MORE COMMON IN THE MONTHS OF JULY AND AUGUST ALTHOUGH IT OFTEN COMES ON IN THE VERY DEAD OF WINTER PUPPIES IF OVERFED WILL OFTEN BE SEIZED WITH THIS TROUBLESOME COMPLAINT A HEALTHY PUPPY HARDLY EVER KNOWS WHEN IT HAS HAD ENOUGH
4034-14942-0038 AND IT WILL MOREOVER STUFF ITSELF WITH ALL SORTS OF GARBAGE ACIDITY OF THE STOMACH FOLLOWS WITH VOMITING OF THE INGESTA AND DIARRHOEA SUCCEEDS BROUGHT ON BY THE ACRID CONDITION OF THE CHYME WHICH FINDS ITS WAY INTO THE DUODENUM
4034-14942-0039 AMONG OTHER CAUSES WE FIND THE EATING OF INDIGESTIBLE FOOD DRINKING FOUL OR TAINTED WATER TOO MUCH GREEN FOOD RAW PAUNCHES FOUL KENNELS AND DAMP DRAUGHTY KENNELS SYMPTOMS
4034-14942-0040 THE PURGING IS OF COURSE THE PRINCIPAL SYMPTOM AND THE STOOLS ARE EITHER QUITE LIQUID OR SEMI FLUID BILIOUS LOOKING DIRTY BROWN OR CLAY COLOURED OR MIXED WITH SLIMY MUCUS IN SOME CASES THEY RESEMBLE DIRTY WATER
4034-14942-0041 SOMETIMES AS ALREADY SAID A LITTLE BLOOD WILL BE FOUND IN THE DEJECTION OWING TO CONGESTION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE FROM LIVER OBSTRUCTION IN CASE THERE BE BLOOD IN THE STOOLS
4034-14942-0042 A CAREFUL EXAMINATION IS ALWAYS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE REAL STATE OF THE PATIENT BLOOD IT MUST BE REMEMBERED MIGHT COME FROM PILES OR POLYPI OR IT MIGHT BE DYSENTERIC AND PROCEED FROM ULCERATION OF THE RECTUM AND COLON
4034-14942-0043 IN THE SIMPLEST FORM OF DIARRHOEA UNLESS THE DISEASE CONTINUES FOR A LONG TIME THERE WILL NOT BE MUCH WASTING AND THE APPETITE WILL GENERALLY REMAIN GOOD BUT CAPRICIOUS
4034-14942-0044 IN BILIOUS DIARRHOEA WITH LARGE BROWN FLUID STOOLS AND COMPLETE LOSS OF APPETITE THERE IS MUCH THIRST AND IN A FEW DAYS THE DOG GETS RATHER THIN ALTHOUGH NOTHING LIKE SO RAPIDLY AS IN THE EMACIATION OF DISTEMPER
4034-14942-0045 WHICH YOU CAN TELL BY THE ANIMAL'S COUNTENANCE FROM FIVE TO TWENTY OR THIRTY DROPS OF LAUDANUM OR OF THE SOLUTION OF THE MURIATE OF MORPHIA THIS IN ITSELF WILL OFTEN SUFFICE TO CUT SHORT AN ATTACK THE OIL IS PREFERABLE TO RHUBARB
4034-14942-0046 BUT THE LATTER MAY BE TRIED THE SIMPLE NOT THE COMPOUND POWDER DOSE FROM TEN GRAINS TO TWO DRACHMS IN BOLUS IT THE DIARRHOEA SHOULD CONTINUE NEXT DAY PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY REMEMBER THERE IS NO GREAT HURRY
4034-14942-0047 AND A SUDDEN CHECK TO DIARRHOEA IS AT TIMES DANGEROUS TO ADMINISTER DOG DOSES OF THE AROMATIC CHALK AND OPIUM POWDER OR GIVE THE FOLLOWING MEDICINE THREE TIMES A DAY COMPOUND POWDERED CATECHU ONE GRAIN TO TEN POWDERED CHALK WITH OPIUM
