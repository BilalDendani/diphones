7683-103530-0003 ALL RIGHT FATHER THE WOMAN TURNED AWAY HER STEP WAS SLOW BUT CONFIDENT THE LAST WORD HAD BEEN SAID TO JANE PENDERGAST HER FATHER HAD GONE WITH THE GOING OF HIS KEEN CLEAR MIND TWENTY YEARS BEFORE
7683-103530-0004 THIS FRETFUL CHILDISH EXACTING OLD MAN THAT POTTERED ABOUT THE HOUSE ALL DAY WAS BUT THE SHELL THAT HAD HELD THE KERNEL THE CASKET THAT HAD HELD THE JEWEL BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT HAD HELD JANE GUARDED IT TENDERLY
7683-103530-0005 LAYING AT ITS FEET HER LIFE AS A WILLING SACRIFICE THERE HAD BEEN FOUR CHILDREN EDGAR THE ELDEST JANE MARY AND FRED EDGAR HAD LEFT HOME EARLY AND WAS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MAN IN BOSTON

7683-103530-0007 BUT THE DEATH OF MISSUS PENDERGAST LEFT NO ONE AT HOME TO CARE FOR MARY AND FRED SO JANE HAD ABANDONED THE IDEA LATER AFTER MARY HAD MARRIED AND FRED HAD GONE AWAY
7683-103530-0008 THOUGH AT THIS TIME HE WAS WELL AND STRONG JANE HAD PASSED HER THIRTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY
7683-103530-0009 BLUE GRAY EYES AND A DETERMINED SMOOTH SHAVEN CHIN BELONGING TO THE RECENTLY ARRIVED PRINCIPAL OF THE VILLAGE SCHOOL IN SPITE OF HER STERN ADMONITION TO HERSELF TO REMEMBER HER YEARS AND NOT QUITE LOSE HER HEAD
7683-103530-0010 SHE WAS FAST DRIFTING INTO A ROSY DREAM OF ROMANCE THAT WAS ALL THE MORE ENTHRALLING BECAUSE SO BELATED WHEN THE SUMMONS OF A SMALL BOY BROUGHT HER SHARPLY BACK TO THE REALITIES IT'S YER FATHER MISS THEY WANT YE TER COME HE PANTED

7683-103530-0013 THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE THEY SAID EXCEPT TO CARE FOR HIM AS ONE WOULD FOR A CHILD HE WOULD LIVE YEARS PROBABLY HIS CONSTITUTION WAS WONDERFULLY GOOD
7683-103530-0014 HE WOULD NOT BE VIOLENT JUST FOOLISH AND CHILDISH WITH PERHAPS A GROWING IRRITABILITY AS THE YEARS PASSED AND HIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH FAILED MARY AND EDGAR HAD COME HOME AT ONCE
7683-103530-0015 AND FOLLOWED HER ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH UNFAILING PERSISTENCE
7683-103530-0016 REMONSTRATED JANE MARY SHUDDERED AND COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS JANE JANE HOW CAN YOU TAKE IT SO CALMLY SHE MOANED HOW CAN YOU BEAR IT THERE WAS A MOMENT'S PAUSE A CURIOUS EXPRESSION HAD COME TO JANE'S FACE
7683-103530-0017 SOME ONE HAS TO SHE SAID AT LAST QUIETLY JANE WENT DOWN TO THE VILLAGE THE NEXT AFTERNOON LEAVING HER SISTER IN CHARGE AT HOME WHEN SHE RETURNED AN HOUR LATER MARY MET HER AT THE GATE CRYING AND WRINGING HER HANDS
7683-103530-0018 JANE JANE I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER COME I CAN'T DO A THING WITH HIM HE INSISTS THAT HE ISN'T AT HOME AND THAT HE WANTS TO GO THERE I TOLD HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT HE WAS AT HOME ALREADY BUT IT DIDN'T DO A BIT OF GOOD I'VE HAD A PERFECTLY AWFUL TIME
7683-103530-0019 YES I KNOW WHERE IS HE IN THE KITCHEN I I TIED HIM HE JUST WOULD GO AND I COULDN'T HOLD HIM OH MARY AND JANE FAIRLY FLEW UP THE WALK TO THE KITCHEN DOOR A MINUTE LATER SHE APPEARED LEADING AN OLD MAN WHO WAS WHIMPERING PITIFULLY
7683-103530-0020 AND MARY WATCHED WITH WONDERING EYES WHILE THE TWO WALKED DOWN THE PATH THROUGH THE GATE AND ACROSS THE STREET TO THE NEXT CORNER THEN SLOWLY CROSSED AGAIN AND CAME BACK THROUGH THE FAMILIAR DOORWAY
7683-103530-0021 MARY WENT BACK TO BOSTON THE NEXT DAY SHE SAID IT WAS FORTUNATE INDEED THAT JANE'S NERVES WERE SO STRONG FOR HER PART SHE COULD NOT HAVE STOOD IT ANOTHER DAY
7683-103530-0022 TO COME IN FOR AN HOUR OR TWO ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK WHEN SHE HERSELF WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE THE OWNER OF THE BLUE GRAY EYES DID NOT BELIE THE DETERMINATION OF HIS CHIN BUT MADE A VALIANT EFFORT TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF ON THE BASIS OF THE OLD INTIMACY
7683-103530-0023 IN A YEAR HE HAD LEFT TOWN BUT IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO AWAY ALONE AS JANE PENDERGAST WELL KNEW ONE BY ONE THE YEARS PASSED
7683-103530-0024 JANE WAS FIFTY FIVE NOW A THIN FACED STOOP SHOULDERED TIRED WOMAN
7683-103530-0025 FOR SHE WAS NOT YET FIFTY SIX WHEN HER FATHER DIED ALL THE CHILDREN AND SOME OF THE GRANDCHILDREN CAME TO THE FUNERAL

7683-103530-0031 AS HE THOUGHT OF JANE IN HER FIVE YEAR OLD BONNET AND HER TEN YEAR OLD BLACK GOWN STANDING IN THE RECEIVING LINE AT AN EXCLUSIVE COMMONWEALTH AVENUE RECEPTION WELL BUT EDGAR PAUSED IMPOTENTLY
7683-103530-0032 WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HER IT WAS MARY WHO MADE THE SUGGESTION I OH BUT I EDGAR STOPPED AND GLANCED UNEASILY AT HIS WIFE WHY OF COURSE IF IT'S NECESSARY MURMURED MISSUS EDGAR WITH A RESIGNED AIR
