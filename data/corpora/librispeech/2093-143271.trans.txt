2093-143271-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY NINE HOW WE TOOK A LAST LOOK ROUND AND FOUND IT WAS TIME TO GO THAT NEXT EVENING SEEMED AS IT WOULD NEVER COME
2093-143271-0001 IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT WE DID FOR JUST AS IT WAS GROWING DUSK AFTER A GOOD LOOK ROUND WE WERE ABOUT TO CROSS THE RIVULET AND GO THROUGH THE CAVERN AND UP THE RIFT BACK INTO CAMP WHEN I CAUGHT THE DOCTOR'S ARM WITHOUT A WORD
2093-143271-0002 HE STARTED AND LOOKED IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS I DID WHICH WAS RIGHT DOWN THE GULLY AND SAW WHAT HAD TAKEN MY ATTENTION NAMELY THE STOOPING BODIES OF A COUPLE OF BLACKS HURRYING AWAY THROUGH THE BUSHES AT A PRETTY GOOD RATE
2093-143271-0003 AND THEY'LL COME BACK WITH A LOT OF THEIR WARRIORS TO ATTACK US TO NIGHT AND FIND US GONE AND WHILE THEY ARE GONE JOE WE WILL ATTACK THEIR PLACE AND CARRY OFF OUR PRIZE
2093-143271-0004 AND AS WE ENTERED I LOOKED ROUND AGAIN TO CATCH SIGHT OF ANOTHER BLACK FIGURE CROUCHING FAR UP THE OPPOSITE BANK AT THE FOOT OF A GREAT TREE I DID NOT SPEAK FOR IT WAS BETTER THAT THE BLACK SHOULD NOT THINK HE HAD BEEN SEEN
2093-143271-0005 SO FOLLOWED THE DOCTOR INTO THE CAVE CLIMBED THE RIFT WITH HIM
2093-143271-0006 SMELL UM BLACK FELLOW ONE EYE PEEPING ROUND UM TREES YES WE HAVE SEEN THEM TOO I SAID
2093-143271-0007 GLIDING SILENTLY THROUGH THE FOREST FOR QUITE THREE HOURS WHEN MISTER FRANCIS STOPPED AND IT WAS DECIDED TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES A LITTLE BEFORE PROCEEDING FARTHER THE DOCTOR HAD SETTLED
2093-143271-0008 IF YOU GO ALONE YOU WILL LOSE TIME AND YOUR EXPEDITION MAY HE STOPPED SHORT AND LAY DOWN UPON THE EARTH FOR A FEW MINUTES DURING WHICH THE DOCTOR REMAINED UNDECIDED
2093-143271-0009 AT LAST HE BENT DOWN AND WHISPERED A FEW WORDS TO HIS PATIENT WHO IMMEDIATELY ROSE ORDERS WERE THEN GIVEN TO THE BLACKS WHO WERE TO STAY UNDER THE COMMAND OF JACK PENNY AND FOLLOWED BY JIMMY
2093-143271-0010 AND STEPPING MORE CAUTIOUSLY WE WERE SOON CLOSE UP BEHIND A GREAT HUT THIS IS THE PLACE WHISPERED MISTER FRANCIS HE IS KEPT PRISONER HERE OR ELSE AT THE GREAT HUT ON THE OTHER SIDE HIST
2093-143271-0011 I'LL CREEP FORWARD AND LISTEN HE WENT DOWN IN A STOOPING POSITION AND DISAPPEARED LEAVING US LISTENING TO THE CONTINUOUS TALK OF EVIDENTLY A NUMEROUS PARTY OF THE SAVAGES
2093-143271-0012 AND SO LIKE DID IT ALL SEEM TO THE LAST TIME THAT NO TIME MIGHT HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE CROUCHED THERE BREATHING HEAVILY WITH EXCITEMENT
2093-143271-0013 I WHISPERED ONCE OR TWICE TO THE DOCTOR BUT HE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY LIPS I TURNED TO JIMMY BUT HE HAD CROUCHED DOWN AND WAS RESTING HIMSELF ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT
2093-143271-0014 AND SO QUITE AN HOUR PASSED AWAY BEFORE WE WERE AWARE BY A SLIGHT RUSTLE THAT MISTER FRANCIS WAS BACK LOOMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS LIKE SOME GIANT SO STRANGELY DID THE OBSCURITY
2093-143271-0015 DISTORT EVERYTHING NEAR AT HAND HERE HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AND BENDING DOWN WE ALL LISTENED TO HIS WORDS WHICH CAME FEEBLY CONSEQUENT UPON HIS EXERTIONS I HAVE BEEN TO THE FAR HUT
2093-143271-0016 AND THEN HE MUTTERED SOMETHING IN THE SAVAGES TONGUE AND THEN BROKE DOWN AND BEGAN TO SOB TAKE NO NOTICE THE DOCTOR WHISPERED TO ME AS I STOOD TREMBLING THERE FEELING AS I DID THAT I WAS ONLY A FEW YARDS
2093-143271-0017 FROM HIM WE HAD COME TO SAVE AND WHO WAS LYING BOUND THERE WAITING FOR THE HELP THAT SEEMED AS IF IT WOULD NEVER COME THE DOCTOR REALISED MY FEELINGS FOR HE CAME A LITTLE CLOSER AND PRESSED MY HAND

2093-143271-0019 THAN WHEN WE STARTED YES I SAID BUT BUT NONSENSE BOY WHY WE'VE FOUND YOUR FATHER WE KNOW WHERE HE IS AND IF WE CAN'T GET HIM AWAY BY STRATAGEM
2093-143271-0020 WE'LL GO TO ANOTHER TRIBE OF THE BLACKS MAKE FRIENDS WITH THEM AND GET THEM TO FIGHT ON OUR SIDE NONSENSE DOCTOR I SAID BITTERLY YOU ARE ONLY SAYING THIS TO COMFORT ME TO GET YOU TO ACT LIKE A MAN HE SAID SHARPLY
2093-143271-0021 AND TO SET MY BRAIN AT WORK SCHEMING IT SEEMED TO GROW DARKER JUST THEN THE STARS FADING OUT BEHIND A THICK VEIL OF CLOUDS AND CREEPING NEARER TO THE DOCTOR I SAT DOWN BESIDE WHERE HE KNELT
2093-143271-0022 LISTENING TO THE INCESSANT TALKING OF THE SAVAGES
2093-143271-0023 AND NOW RISING INTO QUITE AN ANGRY SHOUT NOW DESCENDING INTO A LOW BUZZ THE TALK TALK TALK WENT ON AS IF THEY WERE SAYING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
2093-143271-0024 AND ALL THIS WHILE THE TALKING WENT ON RISING AND FALLING TILL IT SEEMED ALMOST MADDENING TO HEAR WE MUST HAVE WAITED THERE QUITE A COUPLE OF HOURS AND STILL THERE WAS NO CHANGE
2093-143271-0025 AT LAST HE CREPT FROM ME TO SPEAK TO MISTER FRANCIS IT IS OF NO USE TO STAY LONGER I'M AFRAID MY LAD HE WHISPERED UNLESS WE WAIT AND SEE WHETHER THE HUT IS LEFT EMPTY WHEN THE EXPEDITION PARTY COMES BACK
2093-143271-0026 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN I SAID ASK FRANCIS TO SUGGEST A BETTER HIDING PLACE FOR US WHERE WE CAN GO TO NIGHT AND WAIT FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY I SIGHED
2093-143271-0027 FOR I WAS WEARY OF WAITING FOR OPPORTUNITIES FAST ASLEEP POOR FELLOW HE WHISPERED COMING BACK SO SILENTLY THAT HE STARTLED ME WHERE'S THE BLACK
2093-143271-0028 I TURNED SHARPLY TO WHERE JIMMY HAD BEEN CURLED UP BUT HE WAS GONE I CREPT A LITTLE WAY IN TWO OR THREE DIRECTIONS BUT HE WAS NOT WITH US AND I SAID SO HOW
2093-143271-0029 DARE HE GO THE DOCTOR SAID ANGRILY HE WILL RUIN OUR PLANS WHAT'S THAT GYP I SAID AS THE DOG CREPT UP TO US AND THRUST HIS HEAD AGAINST MY HAND JACK PENNY IS GETTING ANXIOUS
2093-143271-0030 IT IS A SIGNAL FOR US TO COME BACK HOW DO YOU KNOW WE AGREED UPON IT I SAID HE WAS TO SEND THE DOG IN SEARCH OF US IF WE DID NOT JOIN HIM IN TWO HOURS AND IF WE WERE IN TROUBLE
2093-143271-0031 I WAS EITHER TO TIE SOMETHING TO HIS COLLAR OR TAKE IT OFF DO NEITHER SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY LOOK THEY ARE LIGHTING A FIRE THE OTHERS MUST HAVE COME BACK
2093-143271-0032 I TURNED AND SAW A FAINT GLOW AWAY OVER THE RIGHT CORNER OF THE HUT AND THEN THERE WAS A SHOUT AND THE SHRILL CRIES OF SOME WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN A MOMENT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT IN THE HUT BEFORE US
2093-143271-0033 THE SAVAGES SWARMING OUT LIKE ANGRY BEES AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WHOLE SHAPE OF THE GREAT LONG HUT STOOD OUT AGAINST THE SKY THE VILLAGE IS ON FIRE WHISPERED THE DOCTOR BACK MY BOY FRANCIS QUICK

2093-143271-0035 I'M READY STOP FOR YOUR LIVES SAID A VOICE AT OUR ELBOW AND TURNING I SAW MISTER FRANCIS WITH HIS SWARTHY FACE LIT UP BY THE FIRE YOU COULD NOT GET NEAR THE HUT NOW WITHOUT BEING SEEN
