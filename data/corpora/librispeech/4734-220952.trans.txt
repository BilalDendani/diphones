4734-220952-0000 AND EVEN HIS OWN FAMILY BY REJECTING ALL THEIR GODS ALONE AND WITHOUT HELP HE RESISTED A POWERFUL TRIBE A TASK WHICH IS NEITHER SIMPLE NOR EASY IT IS AS IF IN THIS DAY SOMEONE WERE TO GO TO A CHRISTIAN PEOPLE
4734-220952-0001 WHO ARE ATTACHED TO THE BIBLE AND DENY CHRIST OR IN THE PAPAL COURT
4734-220952-0002 THESE PEOPLE BELIEVED NOT IN ONE GOD BUT IN MANY GODS TO WHOM THEY ASCRIBED MIRACLES THEREFORE THEY ALL AROSE AGAINST HIM AND NO ONE SUPPORTED HIM EXCEPT LOT HIS BROTHER'S SON AND ONE OR TWO OTHER PEOPLE OF NO IMPORTANCE
4734-220952-0003 AT LAST REDUCED TO THE UTMOST DISTRESS BY THE OPPOSITION OF HIS ENEMIES HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HIS NATIVE LAND IN REALITY THEY BANISHED HIM IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE CRUSHED AND DESTROYED
4734-220952-0004 A JACOB APPEARED AMONG HIS POSTERITY AND A JOSEPH WHO BECAME RULER IN EGYPT IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS EXILE A MOSES AND A BEING LIKE CHRIST WERE MANIFESTED FROM HIS POSTERITY AND HAGAR WAS FOUND FROM WHOM ISHMAEL WAS BORN ONE OF WHOSE DESCENDANTS WAS MUHAMMAD
4734-220952-0005 AND SO IT WILL CONTINUE FOR EVER AND EVER FINALLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS EXILE THE WHOLE OF EUROPE AND MOST OF ASIA CAME UNDER THE PROTECTING SHADOW OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL
4734-220952-0006 SEE WHAT A POWER IT IS THAT ENABLED A MAN WHO WAS A FUGITIVE FROM HIS COUNTRY TO FOUND SUCH A FAMILY TO ESTABLISH SUCH A FAITH AND TO PROMULGATE SUCH TEACHINGS
4734-220952-0007 WE MUST BE JUST WAS THIS MAN AN EDUCATOR OR NOT
4734-220952-0008 WE MUST CONSIDER WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT OF THE EXILE OF BAHA'U'LLAH
4734-220952-0009 SEE WHAT A PERFECT EDUCATOR ABRAHAM WAS
4734-220952-0010 MADE THEM CONTENTED BROUGHT THEM OUT FROM EGYPT AND LED THEM TO THE HOLY LAND THIS PEOPLE FROM THE DEPTHS OF DEGRADATION WERE LIFTED UP TO THE HEIGHT OF GLORY THEY WERE CAPTIVE THEY BECAME FREE
4734-220952-0011 THEY WERE THE MOST IGNORANT OF PEOPLES THEY BECAME THE MOST WISE AS THE RESULT OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT MOSES GAVE THEM THEY ATTAINED A POSITION WHICH ENTITLED THEM TO HONOR AMONG ALL NATIONS AND THEIR FAME SPREAD TO ALL LANDS TO SUCH A DEGREE INDEED
4734-220952-0012 THAT AMONG SURROUNDING NATIONS IF ONE WISHED TO PRAISE A MAN ONE SAID SURELY HE IS AN ISRAELITE
4734-220952-0013 THESE GAVE LIFE TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL
4734-220952-0014 LATER THE PEOPLE OF GREECE ROSE IN OPPOSITION TO HIM ACCUSED HIM OF IMPIETY ARRAIGNED HIM BEFORE THE AREOPAGUS AND CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATH BY POISON NOW HOW COULD A MAN WHO WAS A STAMMERER WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE HOUSE OF PHARAOH
4734-220952-0015 WHO WAS KNOWN AMONG MEN AS A MURDERER WHO THROUGH FEAR HAD FOR A LONG TIME REMAINED IN CONCEALMENT AND WHO HAD BECOME A SHEPHERD ESTABLISH SO GREAT A CAUSE WHEN THE WISEST PHILOSOPHERS ON EARTH HAVE NOT DISPLAYED ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THIS INFLUENCE
4734-220952-0016 THIS IS INDEED A PRODIGY A MAN WHO HAD A STAMMERING TONGUE WHO COULD NOT EVEN CONVERSE CORRECTLY SUCCEEDED IN SUSTAINING THIS GREAT CAUSE
4734-220952-0017 THESE FACTS ARE UNDENIABLE
4734-220952-0018 EACH ONE OF THEM HAVING SPECIALIZED IN ONE BRANCH OF LEARNING ONLY THUS GALEN AND HIPPOCRATES BECAME CELEBRATED IN MEDICINE ARISTOTLE IN LOGIC AND REASONING AND PLATO IN ETHICS AND THEOLOGY HOW IS IT THAT A SHEPHERD COULD ACQUIRE ALL OF THIS KNOWLEDGE
4734-220952-0019 IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN ASSISTED BY AN OMNIPOTENT POWER CONSIDER ALSO WHAT TRIALS AND DIFFICULTIES ARISE FOR PEOPLE TO PREVENT AN ACT OF CRUELTY MOSES STRUCK DOWN AN EGYPTIAN
4734-220952-0020 MORE NOTABLY BECAUSE THE MAN HE HAD KILLED WAS OF THE RULING NATION THEN HE FLED AND IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT HE WAS RAISED TO THE RANK OF A PROPHET IN SPITE OF HIS EVIL REPUTE HOW WONDERFULLY HE WAS GUIDED BY A SUPERNATURAL POWER
4734-220952-0021 IN ESTABLISHING HIS GREAT INSTITUTIONS AND LAWS
4734-220952-0022 CHRIST AFTERWARD CHRIST CAME SAYING I AM BORN OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THOUGH IT IS NOW EASY FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO BELIEVE THIS ASSERTION
4734-220952-0023 AROSE WITH SUCH GREAT POWER THAT HE ABOLISHED A RELIGION THAT HAD LASTED FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AT A TIME WHEN THE SLIGHTEST DEVIATION FROM IT EXPOSED THE OFFENDER TO DANGER OR TO DEATH
4734-220952-0024 MOREOVER IN THE DAYS OF CHRIST THE MORALS OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND THE CONDITION OF THE ISRAELITES HAD BECOME COMPLETELY CONFUSED AND CORRUPTED AND ISRAEL HAD FALLEN INTO A STATE OF THE UTMOST DEGRADATION MISERY AND BONDAGE
4734-220952-0025 AT ONE TIME THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE BY THE CHALDEANS AND PERSIANS
4734-220952-0026 THEN THEY BECAME THE SUBJECTS AND VASSALS OF THE GREEKS
4734-220952-0027 THIS YOUNG MAN CHRIST BY THE HELP OF A SUPERNATURAL POWER ABROGATED THE ANCIENT MOSAIC LAW REFORMED THE GENERAL MORALS AND ONCE AGAIN LAID THE FOUNDATION OF ETERNAL GLORY FOR THE ISRAELITES MOREOVER
4734-220952-0028 HE BROUGHT TO HUMANITY THE GLAD TIDINGS OF UNIVERSAL PEACE AND SPREAD ABROAD TEACHINGS WHICH WERE NOT FOR ISRAEL ALONE BUT WERE FOR THE GENERAL HAPPINESS OF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
4734-220952-0029 TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES THEY OVERCAME HIM AND BROUGHT HIM INTO DIREST DISTRESS AT LAST THEY CROWNED HIM WITH THE CROWN OF THORNS AND CRUCIFIED HIM BUT CHRIST WHILE APPARENTLY IN THE DEEPEST MISERY AND AFFLICTION PROCLAIMED
4734-220952-0030 THIS SUN WILL BE RESPLENDENT THIS LIGHT WILL SHINE MY GRACE WILL SURROUND THE WORLD AND ALL MY ENEMIES WILL BE BROUGHT LOW AND AS HE SAID SO IT WAS FOR ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND HIM
4734-220952-0031 NAY ALL THEIR STANDARDS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN
