8367-279366-0000 BUT COLONEL WINCHESTER AND THE COMMANDER OF THE OHIO REGIMENT WERE FULL OF PRIDE IN THEIR EXPLOIT AS THEY HAD A RIGHT TO BE
8367-279366-0001 THE CORPS MOVED FORWARD THE NEXT DAY AND SOON THE WHOLE ARMY WAS UNITED UNDER ROSECRANS IT WAS A POWERFUL FORCE ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND MEN THE STAUNCH FIGHTERS OF THE WEST VETERANS OF GREAT BATTLES AND VICTORIES AND TO THE YOUNG OFFICERS IT APPEARED INVINCIBLE
8367-279366-0002 THEIR FEELING THAT IT WAS MARCHING TO ANOTHER TRIUMPH WAS CONFIRMED BY THE NEWS THAT BRAGG WAS RETREATING YET THE TWO ARMIES WERE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER THAT THE NORTHERN VANGUARD SKIRMISHED WITH THE SOUTHERN REARGUARD AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS
8367-279366-0003 AT ONE POINT IN A GAP OF THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS THE SOUTHERNERS MADE A SHARP RESISTANCE
8367-279366-0004 EXULTATION AMONG THE TROOPS INCREASED WE'LL DRIVE BRAGG AWAY DOWN INTO THE SOUTH AGAINST GRANT SAID OHIO TO DICK
8367-279366-0005 THAT WILL FINISH EVERYTHING IN THE WEST WHILE DICK WAS EXULTANT TOO HE HAD CERTAIN RESERVATIONS HE HAD SEEN A LIKE CONFIDENCE CARRIED TO DISASTER IN THE EAST ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT SEEM POSSIBLE THAT THE RESULT HERE COULD BE SIMILAR
8367-279366-0006 I DON'T THINK THEY'LL KEEP ON RETREATING FOREVER OHIO HE SAID ALL OUR SUPPLIES ARE COMING FROM NASHVILLE AND WE ARE GETTING FARTHER AWAY FROM OUR BASE EVERY DAY BUT OHIO LAUGHED OUR CHIEF TASK IS TO CATCH BRAGG HE SAID
8367-279366-0007 A LITTLE TOWN OF WHICH DICK HAD SELDOM HEARD BEFORE ALTHOUGH HE GREATLY ADMIRED ITS SITUATION THE COUNTRY ABOUT IT WAS BOLD AND ROMANTIC IT STOOD IN A SHARP CURVE OF THE GREAT RIVER THE TENNESSEE NOT FAR AWAY WAS THE LOFTY UPLIFT OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN A HALF MILE HIGH
8367-279366-0008 AND THERE WERE LONG RIDGES BETWEEN WHICH CREEKS OR LITTLE RIVERS FLOWED DOWN TO THE TENNESSEE ONE OF THESE STREAMS WAS THE CHICKAMAUGA WHICH IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE CHEROKEE INDIANS WHO HAD ONCE OWNED THIS REGION MEANS THE RIVER OF DEATH WHY THEY CALLED IT SO NO ONE KNEW BUT THE NAME WAS SOON TO HAVE A TERRIBLE FITNESS
8367-279366-0009 CHATTANOOGA ITSELF MEANT IN THE CHEROKEE TONGUE THE HAWK'S NEST AND ANYBODY COULD SEE THE APTNESS OF THE TERM WHILE LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN WAS THE LOFTIEST SUMMIT SOME OF THE OTHER RIDGES ROSE ALMOST AS HIGH THROUGH THE GAPS OF WHICH THE NORTHERN ARMY MUST PASS IF IT CONTINUED THE PURSUIT OF BRAGG
8367-279366-0010 SEPTEMBER HAD NOW COME AND THE WINDS WERE GROWING CRISPER IN THE HIGH COUNTRY THE FEEL OF AUTUMN WAS IN THE AIR AND THE COOLNESS MADE THE MARCHING BRISKER THE DIVISION TO WHICH DICK BELONGED WAS ADVANCING SLOWLY HE OFTEN SAW THOMAS AND HIS ADMIRATION FOR THE GRAVE SILENT MAN GREW
8367-279366-0011 IT WAS SAID THAT THOMAS WAS SLOW BUT THAT HE NEVER MADE MISTAKES NOW THE RUMOR WAS SPREADING THAT HE HAD WARNED ROSECRANS TO BE CAUTIOUS THAT BRAGG HAD A POWERFUL ARMY AND WHEN HE REACHED FAVORABLE POSITIONS WOULD CERTAINLY TURN AND FIGHT NOT MANY WERE IMPRESSED BY THESE REPORTS
8367-279366-0012 HADN'T THEY DRIVEN BRAGG THROUGH THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS AND OUT OF CHATTANOOGA AND NOW THEY WOULD SOON BE ON HIS HEELS DEEP DOWN IN GEORGIA BUT DICK NOTICING COLONEL WINCHESTER'S SERIOUS FACE SURMISED THAT HE AT LEAST SHARED THE OPINION OF HIS CHIEF
8367-279366-0013 AND WHEN THE LAD LOOKED UP AT THE GREAT COILS AND RIDGES HE FELT THAT IN TRUTH THEY MIGHT GO TOO FAR IF THE NORTHERN MEN WERE VETERANS SO WERE THE SOUTHERN
8367-279366-0014 WHEN THE BEST SCOUTS RODE IN WITH REPORTS THAT THE SOUTHERN RETREAT WAS NOW VERY SLOW THERE WAS NEWS TOO THAT SLADE HAD A NEW BAND MUCH LARGER THAN BEFORE AND THEY FORMED A REAR GUARD OF SKIRMISHERS WHICH MADE EVERY MOMENT OF A NORTHERN SCOUT'S LIFE A MOMENT OF DANGER
8367-279366-0015 THE WINCHESTER REGIMENT ITSELF WAS OFTEN FIRED UPON FROM AMBUSH AND THERE WERE VACANT PLACES IN THE RANKS
8367-279366-0016 BUT MUCH OF HIS HIGH EXULTATION WAS ABATED HE REGARDED THE LOFTY RIDGES AND THE DEEP GAPS WITH APPREHENSION IT WAS A DIFFICULT COUNTRY AND THE SOUTHERN LEADERS MUST KNOW THAT THE NORTHERN ARMY WAS EXTENDED OVER A LONG LINE WITH THOMAS HOLDING THE LEFT
8367-279366-0017 HIS PREMONITIONS HAD AMPLE CAUSE BRAGG AS HE FELL BACK SLOWLY HAD GATHERED NEW FORCES ROSECRANS DID NOT YET KNOW IT BUT THE ARMY BEFORE HIM WAS THE MOST POWERFUL THAT THE SOUTH EVER ASSEMBLED IN THE WEST POLK AND CLEBURNE AND BRECKINRIDGE AND FORREST AND FIGHTING JOE WHEELER
8367-279366-0018 AND A WHOLE LONG ROLL OF FAMOUS SOUTHERN GENERALS WERE THERE NOR HAD THE VIGILANT EYES OF THE CONFEDERACY IN THE EAST FAILED TO NOTE THE SITUATION JUST AS THE ARMIES WERE COMING INTO TOUCH A DIVISION OF THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA WAS PASSING BY TRAIN OVER THE MOUNTAINS
8367-279366-0019 IT WAS LED BY A THICK BEARDED POWERFUL MAN NO LESS A GENERAL THAN THE RENOWNED LONGSTREET SENT TO HELP BRAGG THE VETERANS OF THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA WOULD SWELL BRAGG'S RANKS AND THE GREAT ARMY TURNING A SANGUINE FACE NORTHWARD WAS EAGER FOR ROSECRANS TO COME ON
8367-279366-0020 AND THE NIGHT HAD COME HEAVY WITH OMENS AND PRESAGES THE LEAST INTELLIGENT KNEW NOW THAT BRAGG HAD STOPPED BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT LONGSTREET WAS TO BE WITH HIM
8367-279366-0021 IN A WAY YES REPLIED WARNER BUT MY HILLS ARE NOT BRISTLING WITH STEEL AS THESE ARE NO YOU NEW ENGLANDERS ARE FORTUNATE THE WAR WILL NEVER BE CARRIED ON ON YOUR SOIL YOU SHED YOUR BLOOD BUT AFTER ALL THE STATES THAT ARE TRODDEN UNDER FOOT BY THE ARMIES SUFFER MOST
8367-279366-0022 THERE ARE LIGHTS WINKING ON THE MOUNTAINS AGAIN SAID PENNINGTON LET EM WINK SAID DICK THEIR SIGNALS CAN'T AMOUNT TO MUCH NOW
8367-279366-0023 FELLOWS I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE RESULT COME COME DICK SAID WARNER
8367-279366-0024 NOTHING GEORGE BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME AND THE GATE POST I WISH THAT OUR OLD PAP THOMAS COMMANDED ALL THE ARMY INSTEAD OF THE LEFT MERELY I'VE LEARNED A FEW THINGS TO DAY THE ENEMY IS SPREADING OUT TRYING TO ENFOLD US ON BOTH WINGS WHAT OF IT
8367-279366-0025 AS THEY THINK WE SURELY WILL BE BUT THEIR MAIN FORCE IS NOT FAR FROM US NOW SO A SCOUT TOLD ME IT'S MASSED HEAVILY ALONG THE RIGHT BANK OF THE CHICKAMAUGA AND IF THERE'S A BATTLE TO MORROW WE'RE LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE FIRST ATTACK COULD IT COME ANY BETTER THAN AT THE PLACE WHERE THOMAS STANDS
8367-279366-0026 THEY SAT LONG BY THE FIRE AND DICK COULD NOT REST SHILOH HIS CAPTURE AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE SECRET SOUTHERN ADVANCE OF WHICH HE COULD GIVE NO WARNING CAME BACK TO HIM WITH UNCOMMON VIVIDNESS HE KNEW THAT NO SUCH SURPRISE COULD OCCUR HERE
8367-279366-0027 BUT THEY SEEMED TO BE LOST IN THE WILDERNESS THE MOUNTAINS AND FORESTS OPPRESSED HIM WELL DICK SAID WARNER WE'RE POSTED STRONGLY WE'VE ROWS OF SENTINELS AS THICK AS HEDGES AND I'VE THE COLONEL'S PERMISSION TO GO TO SLEEP I'LL BE SLUMBERING IN TEN MINUTES AND I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO THE SAME
8367-279366-0028 HE LAY ON A BLANKET AND SOON SLEPT PENNINGTON FOLLOWED HIM TO SLUMBERLAND BUT DICK LINGERED HE SAW LIGHTS STILL FLASHING ON THE MOUNTAINS AND HE HEARD NOW AND THEN REPORTS FROM THE RIFLES OF THE SKIRMISHERS WHO YET SOUGHT EACH OTHER DESPITE THE DARKNESS
8367-279366-0029 WHICH SHOULD BRING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN FACE TO FACE IN MORTAL COMBAT DICK WAS AWAKE EARLY THE SEPTEMBER MORNING CAME CRISP AND CLEAR THE SUN SHOWING RED GLEAMS OVER THE MOUNTAINS
8367-279366-0030 AND THROUGH HIS GLASSES HE SAW FAR AWAY FAINT PUFFS OF SMOKE BUT IT WAS A FAMILIAR SOUND IN THIS MIGHTY WAR AND HE FOUND HIMSELF SINGULARLY CALM HE NEVER KNEW HOW HE WAS GOING TO FEEL ON THE EVE OF BATTLE
8367-279366-0031 SOMETIMES THE CONSTRICTION AT HIS HEART WAS PAINFUL AND SOMETIMES ITS BEAT WAS SMOOTH AND REGULAR ALL THE OFFICERS OF THE WINCHESTER REGIMENT WERE DISMOUNTED OWING TO THE ROUGH NATURE OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY WERE STATIONED THEY HELD THE MOST UNEVEN PART OF THE CENTER WHERE THICKETS AND RAVINES WERE MANY
8367-279366-0032 HOT FOOD AND COFFEE WERE SERVED TO THEM AND NEW WARMTH AND COURAGE FLOWED THROUGH THEIR BODIES THE DISTANT FIRE INCREASED AND STANDING ON A HILLOCK DICK LOOKED LONG THROUGH HIS GLASSES A FAINT HAZE WHICH HAD HUNG IN THE SOUTH WAS CLEARING AWAY THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE INTENSELY BRIGHT
8367-279366-0033 THE BROWN OF AUTUMN GLOWED LIKE GOLD AND THE RED SPLASHES HERE AND THERE BURNED SCARLET
8367-279366-0034 HE SAW PINK DOTS APPEARING ON A LONG LINE AND HE KNEW THAT THE SKIRMISHERS WERE ACTIVE AND WARY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THE ADVANCE HE SAID TO WARNER A STRONG BODY OF OUR CAVALRY DISCLOSED THEIR FORWARD MOVEMENT AND THERE ARE THE SKIRMISHERS SIGNALING THAT BRAGG IS NEAR WONDERFUL FELLOWS THOSE SHARPSHOOTERS
8367-279366-0035 WE STAND IN MASS AND FIGHT TOGETHER BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY TAKES HIS LIFE IN HIS OWN HANDS THE FIRING IS COMING NEARER I THINK WE'LL BE ATTACKED FIRST AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE WARNER SAID I'M SORRY OUR LINE IS EXTENDED SO MUCH
8367-279366-0036 WHAT IF THEY SHOULD CUT THROUGH AND GET BEHIND US THEY'LL NEVER DO IT WHILE GENERAL THOMAS IS HERE
8367-279366-0037 I'D RATHER HAVE HIM COMMANDING US JUST NOW THAN ANY OTHER GENERAL IN THE WORLD
8367-279366-0038 GENERAL THOMAS RODE SLOWLY ALONG HIS LINE INSPECTING THE POSITION OF EVERY REGIMENT AND MAKING SOME CHANGES
8367-279366-0039 IF GRANT WAS A BULLDOG THOMAS WAS ANOTHER THE MEN KNEW HIM THEY HAD SEEN HIM STAND LIKE A ROCK BEFORE AND THE THRILL OF CONFIDENCE AND COURAGE WHICH HELP SO MUCH TO WIN RAN THROUGH THEM ALL
8367-279366-0040 ALL THE MEN IN THE REGIMENT WERE LYING DOWN BUT THE OFFICERS WALKED BACK AND FORTH IN FRONT OF THE LINE IT WAS THE ESPECIAL PRIDE OF THE YOUNGER ONES TO APPEAR UNCONCERNED AND SOME WERE ABLE TO MAKE A BRAVE PRETENSE
8367-279366-0041 BUT ALL THE WHILE THE BATTLE WAS ROLLING NEARER IT WAS NO LONGER AN AFFAIR OF SCOUTING PARTIES THE SKIRMISHERS WERE DRIVEN IN ON EITHER SIDE AND THE MIGHTY SOUTHERN ADVANCE WAS COMING FORWARD IN FULL BATTLE ARRAY
8367-279366-0042 SHELLS BEGAN TO SHRIEK AND FALL AMONG THE NORTHERN MASSES AND THE FIRE OF CANNON AND RIFLES MINGLED IN A SINISTER CRASH BUT THE UNION REGIMENTS ALTHOUGH NOT YET REPLYING REMAINED STEADY ALTHOUGH THE SHOWER OF STEEL THAT WAS BEGINNING TO BEAT UPON THEM FOUND MANY A MARK
8367-279366-0043 VAST COLUMNS OF SMOKE PIERCED BY FIRE ROSE IN FRONT IT SEEMED TO DICK'S VIVID FANCY THAT THE EARTH WAS SHAKING WITH THE TREAD OF THE ADVANCING BRIGADES AND THE THUNDER OF THEIR ARTILLERY BUT HE WAS STILL ABLE TO PRESERVE HIS AIR OF INDIFFERENCE ALTHOUGH HIS HEART WAS NOW BEATING HARD AND FAST
8367-279366-0044 NOW AND THEN WHEN THE SMOKE EDDIED OR THE BANKS OF IT BROKE APART HE RAISED HIS GLASSES AND WITH THEIR POWERFUL VISION SAW THE LONG AND DEEP SOUTHERN COLUMNS ADVANCING THE FIELD BATTERIES IN THE INTERVALS POURING A STORM OF DEATH IT WAS A SINISTER AND TERRIBLE SIGHT
8367-279366-0045 THE SOUTH PRESENTED HERE AN ARMY OUTNUMBERING ITS FORCE AT SHILOH TWO TO ONE AND THEY WERE VETERANS NOW LED BY VETERAN COMMANDERS MOREOVER THEY HAD LONGSTREET AND HIS MATCHLESS FIGHTERS FROM LEE'S ARMY TO BEAR THEM UP
8367-279366-0046 JOHNNIES JOHNNIES JOHNNIES THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM AND THEN MANY THOUSANDS MORE THEY'RE GOING TO STRIKE FULL UPON US HERE LET EM COME WE'RE TAKING ROOT GROWING DEEP INTO THE GROUND AND OLD PAP THOMAS HAS GROWN DEEPEST OF US ALL
8367-279366-0047 IT'LL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE US I HOPE SO
8367-279366-0048 HE STOPPED SHORT IN AMAZED SURPRISE AND PENNINGTON IN WONDER ASKED WHAT IS IT YOU SEE DICK THERE'S A HEAVY CAVALRY FORCE ON THEIR FLANK AND I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A MAN ON A GREAT HORSE LEADING IT I KNOW HIM HE'S COLONEL GEORGE KENTON FATHER OF HARRY KENTON THAT COUSIN OF MINE
8367-279366-0049 AND HERE HE COMES CHARGING YOU BUT IT'S HAPPENED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN THIS WAR THAT RELATIVES HAVE COME FACE TO FACE IN BATTLE
8367-279366-0050 ARE THEY WITHIN RIFLE SHOT DICK NOT YET BUT THEY SOON WILL BE
8367-279366-0051 THE EYE ALONE WAS SUFFICIENT NOW TO WATCH THE CHARGING COLUMNS ALL THE ARTILLERY ON BOTH SIDES WAS COMING INTO ACTION AND THE RIPPING CRASH OF SO MANY CANNON BECAME SO GREAT THAT THE OFFICERS COULD NO LONGER HEAR ONE ANOTHER UNLESS THEY SHOUTED
8367-279366-0052 THE GORGES AND HILLS CAUGHT UP THE SOUND AND GAVE IT BACK IN INCREASED VOLUME DICK HEARD A NEW NOTE IN THE THUNDER IT WAS MADE BY THE SWIFT BEAT OF HOOFS THOUSANDS OF THEM AND THE HAIR ON HIS NECK PRICKLED AT THE ROOTS
8367-279366-0053 FORREST AND THE WILD CAVALRY OF THE SOUTH WERE CHARGING ON THEIR FLANKS HE FELT A SUDDEN HORROR LEST HE BE TRAMPLED UNDER THE HOOFS OF HORSES
8367-279366-0054 COLONEL WINCHESTER SHOUTING IMPERIOUSLY ORDERED HIM AND ALL THE OTHER YOUNG OFFICERS TO STEP BACK NOW AND LIE DOWN DICK OBEYED AND HE CROUCHED BY THE SIDE OF WARNER AND PENNINGTON
8367-279366-0055 THE GREAT BANK OF FIRE AND SMOKE WAS ROLLING NEARER AND YET NEARER AND THE CANNON WERE FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER WITH ALL THE SPEED AND POWER OF THE GUNNERS OFF ON THE FLANK THE OMINOUS TREAD OF SOUTHERN HORSEMEN WAS COMING FAST BULLETS BEGAN NOW TO RAIN AMONG THEM
8367-279366-0056 THE REGIMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BODILY HAD THE MEN NOT BEEN LYING DOWN BUT THEIR TIME TO WAIT AND HOLD THEIR FIRE WAS AT AN END THE COLONEL GAVE THE WORD AND A SHEET OF LIGHT LEAPED FROM THE MOUTHS OF THEIR RIFLES A VAST GAP APPEARED IN THE SOUTHERN LINE BEFORE THEM BUT IN A MINUTE OR TWO IT CLOSED UP
8367-279366-0057 AND THE SOUTHERN MASSES CAME ON AGAIN AS MENACING AS EVER AGAIN DICK'S REGIMENT POURED ITS SHATTERING FIRE UPON THE SOUTHERN COLUMNS AND THEIR FRONT LINES WERE BLOWN AWAY
