7679-276767-0000 HOW STRANGE THIS MASS OF ANCIENT TREASURES MEMENTOS OF PAST PAINS AND PLEASURES THESE VOLUMES CLASPED WITH COSTLY STONE WITH PRINT ALL FADED GILDING GONE
7679-276767-0001 THESE FANS OF LEAVES FROM INDIAN TREES THESE CRIMSON SHELLS FROM INDIAN SEAS THESE TINY PORTRAITS SET IN RINGS ONCE DOUBTLESS DEEMED SUCH PRECIOUS THINGS KEEPSAKES BESTOWED BY LOVE ON FAITH
7679-276767-0002 AND WORN TILL THE RECEIVER'S DEATH NOW STORED WITH CAMEOS CHINA SHELLS IN THIS OLD CLOSET'S DUSTY CELLS I SCARCELY THINK FOR TEN LONG YEARS A HAND HAS TOUCHED THESE RELICS OLD
7679-276767-0003 AND COATING EACH SLOW FORMED APPEARS THE GROWTH OF GREEN AND ANTIQUE MOULD ALL IN THIS HOUSE IS MOSSING OVER ALL IS UNUSED AND DIM AND DAMP NOR LIGHT NOR WARMTH THE ROOMS DISCOVER
7679-276767-0004 BEREFT FOR YEARS OF FIRE AND LAMP THE SUN SOMETIMES IN SUMMER ENTERS THE CASEMENTS WITH REVIVING RAY BUT THE LONG RAINS OF MANY WINTERS MOULDER THE VERY WALLS AWAY
7679-276767-0005 AND OUTSIDE ALL IS IVY CLINGING TO CHIMNEY LATTICE GABLE GREY SCARCELY ONE LITTLE RED ROSE SPRINGING THROUGH THE GREEN MOSS CAN FORCE ITS WAY
7679-276767-0006 UNSCARED THE DAW AND STARLING NESTLE WHERE THE TALL TURRET RISES HIGH AND WINDS ALONE COME NEAR TO RUSTLE THE THICK LEAVES WHERE THEIR CRADLES LIE
7679-276767-0007 I SOMETIMES THINK WHEN LATE AT EVEN I CLIMB THE STAIR RELUCTANTLY SOME SHAPE THAT SHOULD BE WELL IN HEAVEN OR ILL ELSEWHERE WILL PASS BY ME
7679-276767-0008 I FEAR TO SEE THE VERY FACES FAMILIAR THIRTY YEARS AGO EVEN IN THE OLD ACCUSTOMED PLACES WHICH LOOK SO COLD AND GLOOMY NOW
7679-276767-0009 I'VE COME TO CLOSE THE WINDOW HITHER AT TWILIGHT WHEN THE SUN WAS DOWN AND FEAR MY VERY SOUL WOULD WITHER LEST SOMETHING SHOULD BE DIMLY SHOWN TOO MUCH THE BURIED FORM RESEMBLING OF HER WHO ONCE WAS MISTRESS HERE
7679-276767-0010 LEST DOUBTFUL SHADE OR MOONBEAM TREMBLING MIGHT TAKE HER ASPECT ONCE SO DEAR HERS WAS THIS CHAMBER IN HER TIME IT SEEMED TO ME A PLEASANT ROOM
7679-276767-0011 FOR THEN NO CLOUD OF GRIEF OR CRIME HAD CURSED IT WITH A SETTLED GLOOM I HAD NOT SEEN DEATH'S IMAGE LAID IN SHROUD AND SHEET ON YONDER BED BEFORE SHE MARRIED SHE WAS BLEST BLEST IN HER YOUTH
7679-276767-0012 BLEST IN HER WORTH HER MIND WAS CALM ITS SUNNY REST SHONE IN HER EYES MORE CLEAR THAN MIRTH AND WHEN ATTIRED IN RICH ARRAY LIGHT LUSTROUS HAIR ABOUT HER BROW SHE YONDER SAT
7679-276767-0013 A KIND OF DAY LIT UP WHAT SEEMS SO GLOOMY NOW THESE GRIM OAK WALLS EVEN THEN WERE GRIM THAT OLD CARVED CHAIR WAS THEN ANTIQUE
7679-276767-0014 HER NECK AND ARMS OF HUE SO FAIR EYES OF UNCLOUDED SMILING LIGHT HER SOFT AND CURLED AND FLOATING HAIR GEMS AND ATTIRE AS RAINBOW BRIGHT
7679-276767-0015 WATCHING THE SUN SHE SEEMED TO BLESS WITH HAPPY GLANCE THE GLORIOUS SKY SHE LOVED SUCH SCENES AND AS SHE GAZED HER FACE EVINCED HER SPIRIT'S MOOD BEAUTY OR GRANDEUR EVER RAISED IN HER A DEEP FELT GRATITUDE
7679-276767-0016 BUT OF ALL LOVELY THINGS SHE LOVED A CLOUDLESS MOON ON SUMMER NIGHT FULL OFT HAVE I IMPATIENCE PROVED TO SEE HOW LONG HER STILL DELIGHT WOULD FIND A THEME IN REVERIE OUT ON THE LAWN
7679-276767-0017 OR WHERE THE TREES LET IN THE LUSTRE FITFULLY AS THEIR BOUGHS PARTED MOMENTLY TO THE SOFT LANGUID SUMMER BREEZE
7679-276767-0018 DECEIVED BY FALSE AND GUILEFUL TONGUE SHE GAVE HER HAND THEN SUFFERED WRONG OPPRESSED ILL USED SHE FADED YOUNG AND DIED OF GRIEF BY SLOW DECAY OPEN THAT CASKET
7679-276767-0019 LOOK HOW BRIGHT THOSE JEWELS FLASH UPON THE SIGHT THE BRILLIANTS HAVE NOT LOST A RAY OF LUSTRE SINCE HER WEDDING DAY BUT SEE UPON THAT PEARLY CHAIN HOW DIM LIES TIME'S DISCOLOURING STAIN
7679-276767-0020 I'VE SEEN THAT BY HER DAUGHTER WORN FOR ERE SHE DIED A CHILD WAS BORN A CHILD THAT NE'ER ITS MOTHER KNEW THAT LONE AND ALMOST FRIENDLESS GREW
7679-276767-0021 FOR EVER WHEN ITS STEP DREW NIGH AVERTED WAS THE FATHER'S EYE AND THEN A LIFE IMPURE AND WILD MADE HIM A STRANGER TO HIS CHILD ABSORBED IN VICE HE LITTLE CARED ON WHAT SHE DID OR HOW SHE FARED
7679-276767-0022 THE LOVE WITHHELD SHE NEVER SOUGHT SHE GREW UNCHERISHED LEARNT UNTAUGHT TO HER THE INWARD LIFE OF THOUGHT FULL SOON WAS OPEN LAID
7679-276767-0023 I KNOW NOT IF HER FRIENDLESSNESS DID SOMETIMES ON HER SPIRIT PRESS BUT PLAINT SHE NEVER MADE THE BOOK SHELVES WERE HER DARLING TREASURE SHE RARELY SEEMED THE TIME TO MEASURE WHILE SHE COULD READ ALONE
7679-276767-0024 AND SHE TOO LOVED THE TWILIGHT WOOD AND OFTEN IN HER MOTHER'S MOOD AWAY TO YONDER HILL WOULD HIE LIKE HER TO WATCH THE SETTING SUN OR SEE THE STARS BORN ONE BY ONE OUT OF THE DARKENING SKY
7679-276767-0025 NOR WOULD SHE LEAVE THAT HILL TILL NIGHT TREMBLED FROM POLE TO POLE WITH LIGHT EVEN THEN UPON HER HOMEWARD WAY LONG LONG HER WANDERING STEPS DELAYED
7679-276767-0026 TO QUIT THE SOMBRE FOREST SHADE THROUGH WHICH HER EERIE PATHWAY LAY YOU ASK IF SHE HAD BEAUTY'S GRACE I KNOW NOT BUT A NOBLER FACE MY EYES HAVE SELDOM SEEN
7679-276767-0027 A KEEN AND FINE INTELLIGENCE AND BETTER STILL THE TRUEST SENSE WERE IN HER SPEAKING MIEN BUT BLOOM OR LUSTRE WAS THERE NONE ONLY AT MOMENTS FITFUL SHONE AN ARDOUR IN HER EYE
7679-276767-0028 THAT KINDLED ON HER CHEEK A FLUSH WARM AS A RED SKY'S PASSING BLUSH AND QUICK WITH ENERGY HER SPEECH TOO WAS NOT COMMON SPEECH NO WISH TO SHINE OR AIM TO TEACH WAS IN HER WORDS DISPLAYED
7679-276767-0029 SHE STILL BEGAN WITH QUIET SENSE BUT OFT THE FORCE OF ELOQUENCE CAME TO HER LIPS IN AID LANGUAGE AND VOICE UNCONSCIOUS CHANGED AND THOUGHTS IN OTHER WORDS ARRANGED
7679-276767-0030 HER FERVID SOUL TRANSFUSED INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO HEARD AND TRANSIENT STRENGTH AND ARDOUR STIRRED IN MINDS TO STRENGTH UNUSED YET IN GAY CROWD OR FESTAL GLARE GRAVE AND RETIRING WAS HER AIR
7679-276767-0031 TWAS SELDOM SAVE WITH ME ALONE THAT FIRE OF FEELING FREELY SHONE SHE LOVED NOT AWE'S NOR WONDER'S GAZE NOR EVEN EXAGGERATED PRAISE
7679-276767-0032 NOR EVEN NOTICE IF TOO KEEN THE CURIOUS GAZER SEARCHED HER MIEN NATURE'S OWN GREEN EXPANSE REVEALED THE WORLD THE PLEASURES SHE COULD PRIZE ON FREE HILL SIDE IN SUNNY FIELD
7679-276767-0033 IN QUIET SPOTS BY WOODS CONCEALED GREW WILD AND FRESH HER CHOSEN JOYS YET NATURE'S FEELINGS DEEPLY LAY IN THAT ENDOWED AND YOUTHFUL FRAME SHRINED IN HER HEART AND HID FROM DAY
7679-276767-0034 THEY BURNED UNSEEN WITH SILENT FLAME IN YOUTH'S FIRST SEARCH FOR MENTAL LIGHT SHE LIVED BUT TO REFLECT AND LEARN BUT SOON HER MIND'S MATURER MIGHT FOR STRONGER TASK DID PANT AND YEARN
7679-276767-0035 SUSTAINED WITH COURAGE MUTE YET HIGH THE WOUNDS AT WHICH SHE BLED REVEALING ONLY BY ALTERED CHEEK AND EYE SHE BORE IN SILENCE
7679-276767-0036 THE STORM AT LAST BROUGHT DESOLATION AND DROVE HER EXILED FROM HER HOME AND SILENT STILL SHE STRAIGHT ASSEMBLED THE WRECKS OF STRENGTH HER SOUL RETAINED
7679-276767-0037 FOR THOUGH THE WASTED BODY TREMBLED THE UNCONQUERED MIND TO QUAIL DISDAINED SHE CROSSED THE SEA NOW LONE SHE WANDERS BY SEINE'S OR RHINE'S OR ARNO'S FLOW
7679-276767-0038 FAIN WOULD I KNOW IF DISTANCE RENDERS RELIEF OR COMFORT TO HER WOE FAIN WOULD I KNOW IF HENCEFORTH EVER THESE EYES SHALL READ IN HERS AGAIN THAT LIGHT OF LOVE WHICH FADED NEVER
7679-276767-0039 THOUGH DIMMED SO LONG WITH SECRET PAIN SHE WILL RETURN BUT COLD AND ALTERED LIKE ALL WHOSE HOPES TOO SOON DEPART LIKE ALL ON WHOM HAVE BEAT UNSHELTERED
7679-276767-0040 THE BITTER BLASTS THAT BLIGHT THE HEART NO MORE SHALL I BEHOLD HER LYING CALM ON A PILLOW SMOOTHED BY ME NO MORE THAT SPIRIT WORN WITH SIGHING WILL KNOW THE REST OF INFANCY
7679-276767-0041 IF STILL THE PATHS OF LORE SHE FOLLOW TWILL BE WITH TIRED AND GOADED WILL SHE'LL ONLY TOIL THE ACHING HOLLOW THE JOYLESS BLANK OF LIFE TO FILL
7679-276767-0042 AND OH FULL OFT QUITE SPENT AND WEARY HER HAND WILL PAUSE HER HEAD DECLINE THAT LABOUR SEEMS SO HARD AND DREARY ON WHICH NO RAY OF HOPE MAY SHINE THUS
7679-276767-0043 THE PALE BLIGHT OF TIME AND SORROW WILL SHADE WITH GREY HER SOFT DARK HAIR THEN COMES THE DAY THAT KNOWS NO MORROW AND DEATH SUCCEEDS TO LONG DESPAIR
7679-276767-0044 SO SPEAKS EXPERIENCE SAGE AND HOARY I SEE IT PLAINLY KNOW IT WELL LIKE ONE WHO HAVING READ A STORY EACH INCIDENT THEREIN CAN TELL TOUCH NOT THAT RING
7679-276767-0045 THE SIRE OF THAT FORSAKEN CHILD AND NOUGHT HIS RELICS CAN INSPIRE SAVE MEMORIES SIN DEFILED I WHO SAT BY HIS WIFE'S DEATH BED I WHO HIS DAUGHTER LOVED
7679-276767-0046 COULD ALMOST CURSE THE GUILTY DEAD FOR WOES THE GUILTLESS PROVED AND HEAVEN DID CURSE THEY FOUND HIM LAID WHEN CRIME FOR WRATH WAS RIFE COLD WITH THE SUICIDAL BLADE
7679-276767-0047 YOU KNOW THE SPOT WHERE THREE BLACK TREES LIFT UP THEIR BRANCHES FELL AND MOANING CEASELESS AS THE SEAS STILL SEEM IN EVERY PASSING BREEZE THE DEED OF BLOOD TO TELL
7679-276767-0048 THEY NAMED HIM MAD AND LAID HIS BONES WHERE HOLIER ASHES LIE YET DOUBT NOT THAT HIS SPIRIT GROANS IN HELL'S ETERNITY BUT LO
7679-276767-0049 NIGHT CLOSING O'ER THE EARTH INFECTS OUR THOUGHTS WITH GLOOM
