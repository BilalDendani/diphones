6106-58196-0000 EVER SINCE ARRIVING IN WASHINGTON I HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO WORK FOR THE LADIES OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND TO ACCOMPLISH THIS END I WAS READY TO MAKE ALMOST ANY SACRIFICE CONSISTENT WITH PROPRIETY WORK CAME IN SLOWLY
6106-58196-0001 AND I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED FOR I DID NOT KNOW HOW I WAS TO MEET THE BILLS STARING ME IN THE FACE
6106-58196-0002 WHILE IN THIS SITUATION I CALLED AT THE RINGOLDS WHERE I MET MISSUS CAPTAIN LEE MISSUS L WAS IN A STATE BORDERING ON EXCITEMENT AS THE GREAT EVENT OF THE SEASON THE DINNER PARTY GIVEN IN HONOR OF THE PRINCE OF WALES
6106-58196-0003 WAS SOON TO COME OFF AND SHE MUST HAVE A DRESS SUITABLE FOR THE OCCASION THE SILK HAD BEEN PURCHASED BUT A DRESS MAKER HAD NOT YET BEEN FOUND MISS RINGOLD RECOMMENDED ME AND I RECEIVED THE ORDER TO MAKE THE DRESS
6106-58196-0004 WHEN I CALLED ON MISSUS LEE THE NEXT DAY HER HUSBAND WAS IN THE ROOM AND HANDING ME A ROLL OF BANK BILLS AMOUNTING TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE REQUESTED ME TO PURCHASE THE TRIMMINGS AND TO SPARE NO EXPENSE IN MAKING A SELECTION
6106-58196-0005 WITH THE MONEY IN MY POCKET I WENT OUT IN THE STREET ENTERED THE STORE OF HARPER AND MITCHELL AND ASKED TO LOOK AT THEIR LACES MISTER HARPER WAITED ON ME HIMSELF AND WAS POLITE AND KIND
6106-58196-0006 WHEN I ASKED PERMISSION TO CARRY THE LACES TO MISSUS LEE IN ORDER TO LEARN WHETHER SHE COULD APPROVE MY SELECTION OR NOT HE GAVE A READY ASSENT WHEN I REMINDED HIM THAT I WAS A STRANGER
6106-58196-0007 HE REMARKED THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO TRUST ME THAT HE BELIEVED MY FACE WAS THE INDEX TO AN HONEST HEART IT WAS PLEASANT TO BE SPOKEN TO THUS AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE KIND WORDS OF MISTER HARPER I OFTEN RECALL THEM
6106-58196-0008 FOR THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAWN OF A BRIGHTER PERIOD IN MY DARK LIFE I PURCHASED THE TRIMMINGS AND MISTER HARPER ALLOWED ME A COMMISSION OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS ON THE PURCHASE THE DRESS WAS DONE IN TIME AND IT GAVE COMPLETE SATISFACTION
6106-58196-0009 MISSUS LEE ATTRACTED GREAT ATTENTION AT THE DINNER PARTY AND HER ELEGANT DRESS PROVED A GOOD CARD FOR ME I RECEIVED NUMEROUS ORDERS AND WAS RELIEVED FROM ALL PECUNIARY EMBARRASSMENTS
6106-58196-0010 ONE DAY WHEN I WAS VERY BUSY MISSUS MC C DROVE UP TO MY APARTMENTS CAME IN WHERE I WAS ENGAGED WITH MY NEEDLE AND IN HER EMPHATIC WAY SAID LIZZIE I AM INVITED TO DINE AT WILLARD'S ON NEXT SUNDAY

6106-58196-0016 IT APPEARS THAT MISSUS LINCOLN HAD UPSET A CUP OF COFFEE ON THE DRESS SHE DESIGNED WEARING ON THE EVENING OF THE RECEPTION AFTER THE INAUGURATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH RENDERED IT NECESSARY

6106-58196-0029 AND I COULD NOT REST TUESDAY MORNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK I CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS SHOWN INTO A WAITING ROOM AND INFORMED THAT MISSUS LINCOLN WAS AT BREAKFAST
6106-58196-0030 IN THE WAITING ROOM I FOUND NO LESS THAN THREE MANTUA MAKERS WAITING FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH THE WIFE OF THE NEW PRESIDENT IT SEEMS THAT MISSUS LINCOLN HAD TOLD SEVERAL OF HER LADY FRIENDS THAT SHE HAD URGENT NEED FOR A DRESS MAKER
6106-58196-0031 AND THAT EACH OF THESE FRIENDS HAD SENT HER MANTUA MAKER TO THE WHITE HOUSE HOPE FELL AT ONCE WITH SO MANY RIVALS FOR THE POSITION SOUGHT AFTER I REGARDED MY CHANCES FOR SUCCESS AS EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL
