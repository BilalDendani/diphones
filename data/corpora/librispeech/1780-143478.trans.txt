1780-143478-0000 BUT BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO COMMIT HIMSELF TO THIS PERILOUS MIXTURE OF GALLANTRY AND IMPIETY THE YOUNG LADY RESUMING HER WALK GAVE AN EXCLAMATION IN QUITE ANOTHER TONE WELL HERE'S MOTHER I GUESS SHE HASN'T GOT RANDOLPH TO GO TO BED
1780-143478-0001 THE FIGURE OF A LADY APPEARED AT A DISTANCE VERY INDISTINCT IN THE DARKNESS AND ADVANCING WITH A SLOW AND WAVERING MOVEMENT SUDDENLY IT SEEMED TO PAUSE ARE YOU SURE IT IS YOUR MOTHER CAN YOU DISTINGUISH HER IN THIS THICK DUSK
1780-143478-0002 AND WHEN SHE HAS GOT ON MY SHAWL TOO SHE IS ALWAYS WEARING MY THINGS THE LADY IN QUESTION CEASING TO ADVANCE HOVERED VAGUELY ABOUT THE SPOT AT WHICH SHE HAD CHECKED HER STEPS I AM AFRAID YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T SEE YOU SAID WINTERBOURNE OR PERHAPS
1780-143478-0003 HE ADDED THINKING WITH MISS MILLER THE JOKE PERMISSIBLE PERHAPS SHE FEELS GUILTY ABOUT YOUR SHAWL OH IT'S A FEARFUL OLD THING THE YOUNG GIRL REPLIED SERENELY I TOLD HER SHE COULD WEAR IT SHE WON'T COME HERE BECAUSE SHE SEES YOU AH THEN
1780-143478-0004 SAID WINTERBOURNE I HAD BETTER LEAVE YOU OH NO COME ON URGED MISS DAISY MILLER I'M AFRAID YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T APPROVE OF MY WALKING WITH YOU MISS MILLER GAVE HIM A SERIOUS GLANCE IT ISN'T FOR ME IT'S FOR YOU
1780-143478-0005 THAT IS IT'S FOR HER WELL I DON'T KNOW WHO IT'S FOR BUT MOTHER DOESN'T LIKE ANY OF MY GENTLEMEN FRIENDS SHE'S RIGHT DOWN TIMID SHE ALWAYS MAKES A FUSS IF I INTRODUCE A GENTLEMAN BUT I DO INTRODUCE THEM ALMOST ALWAYS
1780-143478-0006 IF I DIDN'T INTRODUCE MY GENTLEMEN FRIENDS TO MOTHER THE YOUNG GIRL ADDED IN HER LITTLE SOFT FLAT MONOTONE I SHOULDN'T THINK I WAS NATURAL TO INTRODUCE ME SAID WINTERBOURNE YOU MUST KNOW MY NAME AND HE PROCEEDED TO PRONOUNCE IT OH
1780-143478-0007 DEAR I CAN'T SAY ALL THAT SAID HIS COMPANION WITH A LAUGH BUT BY THIS TIME THEY HAD COME UP TO MISSUS MILLER WHO AS THEY DREW NEAR WALKED TO THE PARAPET OF THE GARDEN AND LEANED UPON IT LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE LAKE AND TURNING HER BACK TO THEM MOTHER
1780-143478-0008 COMMON SHE WAS AS MISSUS COSTELLO HAD PRONOUNCED HER YET IT WAS A WONDER TO WINTERBOURNE THAT WITH HER COMMONNESS SHE HAD A SINGULARLY DELICATE GRACE HER MOTHER WAS A SMALL SPARE LIGHT PERSON
1780-143478-0009 WITH A WANDERING EYE A VERY EXIGUOUS NOSE AND A LARGE FOREHEAD DECORATED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THIN MUCH FRIZZLED HAIR LIKE HER DAUGHTER MISSUS MILLER WAS DRESSED WITH EXTREME ELEGANCE
1780-143478-0010 SHE HAD ENORMOUS DIAMONDS IN HER EARS SO FAR AS WINTERBOURNE COULD OBSERVE SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING SHE CERTAINLY WAS NOT LOOKING AT HIM DAISY WAS NEAR HER PULLING HER SHAWL STRAIGHT
1780-143478-0011 WHAT ARE YOU DOING POKING ROUND HERE THIS YOUNG LADY INQUIRED BUT BY NO MEANS WITH THAT HARSHNESS OF ACCENT WHICH HER CHOICE OF WORDS MAY IMPLY I DON'T KNOW SAID HER MOTHER TURNING TOWARD THE LAKE AGAIN I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D WANT THAT SHAWL
1780-143478-0012 DAISY EXCLAIMED WELL I DO HER MOTHER ANSWERED WITH A LITTLE LAUGH DID YOU GET RANDOLPH TO GO TO BED ASKED THE YOUNG GIRL NO I COULDN'T INDUCE HIM SAID MISSUS MILLER VERY GENTLY HE WANTS TO TALK TO THE WAITER
1780-143478-0013 HE LIKES TO TALK TO THAT WAITER I WAS TELLING MISTER WINTERBOURNE THE YOUNG GIRL WENT ON AND TO THE YOUNG MAN'S EAR HER TONE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT SHE HAD BEEN UTTERING HIS NAME ALL HER LIFE OH YES SAID WINTERBOURNE I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING YOUR SON
1780-143478-0014 RANDOLPH'S MAMMA WAS SILENT SHE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE LAKE BUT AT LAST SHE SPOKE WELL I DON'T SEE HOW HE LIVES ANYHOW IT ISN'T SO BAD AS IT WAS AT DOVER SAID DAISY MILLER AND WHAT OCCURRED AT DOVER WINTERBOURNE ASKED
1780-143478-0015 HE WOULDN'T GO TO BED AT ALL I GUESS HE SAT UP ALL NIGHT IN THE PUBLIC PARLOR HE WASN'T IN BED AT TWELVE O'CLOCK I KNOW THAT IT WAS HALF PAST TWELVE DECLARED MISSUS MILLER WITH MILD EMPHASIS DOES HE SLEEP MUCH DURING THE DAY WINTERBOURNE DEMANDED
1780-143478-0016 I GUESS HE DOESN'T SLEEP MUCH DAISY REJOINED I WISH HE WOULD SAID HER MOTHER IT SEEMS AS IF HE COULDN'T I THINK HE'S REAL TIRESOME DAISY PURSUED THEN FOR SOME MOMENTS THERE WAS SILENCE WELL DAISY MILLER
1780-143478-0017 SAID THE ELDER LADY PRESENTLY I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D WANT TO TALK AGAINST YOUR OWN BROTHER WELL HE IS TIRESOME MOTHER SAID DAISY QUITE WITHOUT THE ASPERITY OF A RETORT HE'S ONLY NINE URGED MISSUS MILLER
1780-143478-0018 WELL HE WOULDN'T GO TO THAT CASTLE SAID THE YOUNG GIRL I'M GOING THERE WITH MISTER WINTERBOURNE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VERY PLACIDLY MADE DAISY'S MAMMA OFFERED NO RESPONSE WINTERBOURNE TOOK FOR GRANTED THAT SHE DEEPLY DISAPPROVED OF THE PROJECTED EXCURSION
1780-143478-0019 BUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT SHE WAS A SIMPLE EASILY MANAGED PERSON AND THAT A FEW DEFERENTIAL PROTESTATIONS WOULD TAKE THE EDGE FROM HER DISPLEASURE YES HE BEGAN YOUR DAUGHTER HAS KINDLY ALLOWED ME THE HONOR OF BEING HER GUIDE
1780-143478-0020 MISSUS MILLER'S WANDERING EYES ATTACHED THEMSELVES WITH A SORT OF APPEALING AIR TO DAISY WHO HOWEVER STROLLED A FEW STEPS FARTHER GENTLY HUMMING TO HERSELF I PRESUME YOU WILL GO IN THE CARS SAID HER MOTHER
1780-143478-0021 YES OR IN THE BOAT SAID WINTERBOURNE WELL OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW MISSUS MILLER REJOINED I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO THAT CASTLE IT IS A PITY YOU SHOULDN'T GO SAID WINTERBOURNE BEGINNING TO FEEL REASSURED AS TO HER OPPOSITION
1780-143478-0022 AND YET HE WAS QUITE PREPARED TO FIND THAT AS A MATTER OF COURSE SHE MEANT TO ACCOMPANY HER DAUGHTER WE'VE BEEN THINKING EVER SO MUCH ABOUT GOING SHE PURSUED BUT IT SEEMS AS IF WE COULDN'T OF COURSE DAISY SHE WANTS TO GO ROUND BUT THERE'S A LADY HERE
1780-143478-0023 I DON'T KNOW HER NAME SHE SAYS SHE SHOULDN'T THINK WE'D WANT TO GO TO SEE CASTLES HERE SHE SHOULD THINK WE'D WANT TO WAIT TILL WE GOT TO ITALY
1780-143478-0024 CONTINUED MISSUS MILLER WITH AN AIR OF INCREASING CONFIDENCE OF COURSE WE ONLY WANT TO SEE THE PRINCIPAL ONES WE VISITED SEVERAL IN ENGLAND SHE PRESENTLY ADDED AH YES IN ENGLAND THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL CASTLES SAID WINTERBOURNE
1780-143478-0025 WELL IF DAISY FEELS UP TO IT SAID MISSUS MILLER IN A TONE IMPREGNATED WITH A SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ENTERPRISE IT SEEMS AS IF THERE WAS NOTHING SHE WOULDN'T UNDERTAKE OH I THINK SHE'LL ENJOY IT WINTERBOURNE DECLARED
1780-143478-0026 AND HE DESIRED MORE AND MORE TO MAKE IT A CERTAINTY THAT HE WAS TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF A TETE A TETE WITH THE YOUNG LADY WHO WAS STILL STROLLING ALONG IN FRONT OF THEM SOFTLY VOCALIZING YOU ARE NOT DISPOSED MADAM HE INQUIRED TO UNDERTAKE IT YOURSELF
1780-143478-0027 DAISY'S MOTHER LOOKED AT HIM AN INSTANT ASKANCE AND THEN WALKED FORWARD IN SILENCE THEN I GUESS SHE HAD BETTER GO ALONE SHE SAID SIMPLY
1780-143478-0028 WINTERBOURNE OBSERVED TO HIMSELF THAT THIS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF MATERNITY FROM THAT OF THE VIGILANT MATRONS WHO MASSED THEMSELVES IN THE FOREFRONT OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE IN THE DARK OLD CITY AT THE OTHER END OF THE LAKE
1780-143478-0029 BUT HIS MEDITATIONS WERE INTERRUPTED BY HEARING HIS NAME VERY DISTINCTLY PRONOUNCED BY MISSUS MILLER'S UNPROTECTED DAUGHTER MISTER WINTERBOURNE MURMURED DAISY MADEMOISELLE SAID THE YOUNG MAN DON'T YOU WANT TO TAKE ME OUT IN A BOAT
1780-143478-0030 AT PRESENT HE ASKED OF COURSE SAID DAISY
1780-143478-0031 I BEG YOU MADAM TO LET HER GO SAID WINTERBOURNE ARDENTLY FOR HE HAD NEVER YET ENJOYED THE SENSATION OF GUIDING THROUGH THE SUMMER STARLIGHT A SKIFF FREIGHTED WITH A FRESH AND BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL I SHOULDN'T THINK SHE'D WANT TO SAID HER MOTHER
1780-143478-0032 I SHOULD THINK SHE'D RATHER GO INDOORS I'M SURE MISTER WINTERBOURNE WANTS TO TAKE ME DAISY DECLARED HE'S SO AWFULLY DEVOTED
1780-143478-0033 YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ME FOR HALF AN HOUR HER DAUGHTER WENT ON I HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME VERY PLEASANT CONVERSATION WITH YOUR MOTHER SAID WINTERBOURNE WELL I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME OUT IN A BOAT DAISY REPEATED
1780-143478-0034 THEY HAD ALL STOPPED AND SHE HAD TURNED ROUND AND WAS LOOKING AT WINTERBOURNE HER FACE WORE A CHARMING SMILE HER PRETTY EYES WERE GLEAMING SHE WAS SWINGING HER GREAT FAN ABOUT NO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE PRETTIER THAN THAT THOUGHT WINTERBOURNE
1780-143478-0035 THERE ARE HALF A DOZEN BOATS MOORED AT THAT LANDING PLACE HE SAID POINTING TO CERTAIN STEPS WHICH DESCENDED FROM THE GARDEN TO THE LAKE IF YOU WILL DO ME THE HONOR TO ACCEPT MY ARM WE WILL GO AND SELECT ONE OF THEM DAISY STOOD THERE SMILING
1780-143478-0036 SHE THREW BACK HER HEAD AND GAVE A LITTLE LIGHT LAUGH I LIKE A GENTLEMAN TO BE FORMAL SHE DECLARED I ASSURE YOU IT'S A FORMAL OFFER I WAS BOUND I WOULD MAKE YOU SAY SOMETHING DAISY WENT ON YOU SEE IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT SAID WINTERBOURNE
1780-143478-0037 BUT I AM AFRAID YOU ARE CHAFFING ME I THINK NOT SIR REMARKED MISSUS MILLER VERY GENTLY DO THEN LET ME GIVE YOU A ROW HE SAID TO THE YOUNG GIRL IT'S QUITE LOVELY THE WAY YOU SAY THAT CRIED DAISY IT WILL BE STILL MORE LOVELY TO DO IT
1780-143478-0038 YES IT WOULD BE LOVELY SAID DAISY BUT SHE MADE NO MOVEMENT TO ACCOMPANY HIM SHE ONLY STOOD THERE LAUGHING I SHOULD THINK YOU HAD BETTER FIND OUT WHAT TIME IT IS INTERPOSED HER MOTHER IT IS ELEVEN O'CLOCK MADAM
1780-143478-0039 SAID A VOICE WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT OUT OF THE NEIGHBORING DARKNESS AND WINTERBOURNE TURNING PERCEIVED THE FLORID PERSONAGE WHO WAS IN ATTENDANCE UPON THE TWO LADIES HE HAD APPARENTLY JUST APPROACHED OH EUGENIO SAID DAISY I AM GOING OUT IN A BOAT
1780-143478-0040 EUGENIO BOWED AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK MADEMOISELLE I AM GOING WITH MISTER WINTERBOURNE THIS VERY MINUTE DO TELL HER SHE CAN'T SAID MISSUS MILLER TO THE COURIER I THINK YOU HAD BETTER NOT GO OUT IN A BOAT MADEMOISELLE EUGENIO DECLARED
1780-143478-0041 WINTERBOURNE WISHED TO HEAVEN THIS PRETTY GIRL WERE NOT SO FAMILIAR WITH HER COURIER BUT HE SAID NOTHING I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T THINK IT'S PROPER DAISY EXCLAIMED EUGENIO DOESN'T THINK ANYTHING'S PROPER I AM AT YOUR SERVICE SAID WINTERBOURNE
1780-143478-0042 DOES MADEMOISELLE PROPOSE TO GO ALONE
1780-143478-0043 ANSWERED DAISY'S MAMMA THE COURIER LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AT WINTERBOURNE THE LATTER THOUGHT HE WAS SMILING AND THEN SOLEMNLY WITH A BOW AS MADEMOISELLE PLEASES HE SAID
1780-143478-0044 I MYSELF SHALL MAKE A FUSS IF YOU DON'T GO SAID WINTERBOURNE THAT'S ALL I WANT A LITTLE FUSS AND THE YOUNG GIRL BEGAN TO LAUGH AGAIN MISTER RANDOLPH HAS GONE TO BED THE COURIER ANNOUNCED FRIGIDLY OH
1780-143478-0045 DAISY NOW WE CAN GO SAID MISSUS MILLER DAISY TURNED AWAY FROM WINTERBOURNE LOOKING AT HIM SMILING AND FANNING HERSELF GOOD NIGHT SHE SAID I HOPE YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED OR DISGUSTED OR SOMETHING HE LOOKED AT HER
1780-143478-0046 TAKING THE HAND SHE OFFERED HIM I AM PUZZLED HE ANSWERED WELL I HOPE IT WON'T KEEP YOU AWAKE SHE SAID VERY SMARTLY AND UNDER THE ESCORT OF THE PRIVILEGED EUGENIO THE TWO LADIES PASSED TOWARD THE HOUSE WINTERBOURNE STOOD LOOKING AFTER THEM
1780-143478-0047 HE WAS INDEED PUZZLED HE LINGERED BESIDE THE LAKE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TURNING OVER THE MYSTERY OF THE YOUNG GIRL'S SUDDEN FAMILIARITIES AND CAPRICES BUT THE ONLY VERY DEFINITE CONCLUSION HE CAME TO WAS THAT HE SHOULD ENJOY DEUCEDLY GOING OFF WITH HER SOMEWHERE
1780-143478-0048 HE WAITED FOR HER IN THE LARGE HALL OF THE HOTEL WHERE THE COURIERS THE SERVANTS THE FOREIGN TOURISTS WERE LOUNGING ABOUT AND STARING IT WAS NOT THE PLACE HE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN BUT SHE HAD APPOINTED IT
1780-143478-0049 SHE CAME TRIPPING DOWNSTAIRS BUTTONING HER LONG GLOVES SQUEEZING HER FOLDED PARASOL AGAINST HER PRETTY FIGURE DRESSED IN THE PERFECTION OF A SOBERLY ELEGANT TRAVELING COSTUME
1780-143478-0050 WINTERBOURNE WAS A MAN OF IMAGINATION AND AS OUR ANCESTORS USED TO SAY SENSIBILITY AS HE LOOKED AT HER DRESS AND ON THE GREAT STAIRCASE HER LITTLE RAPID CONFIDING STEP HE FELT AS IF THERE WERE SOMETHING ROMANTIC GOING FORWARD
1780-143478-0051 HE COULD HAVE BELIEVED HE WAS GOING TO ELOPE WITH HER HE PASSED OUT WITH HER AMONG ALL THE IDLE PEOPLE THAT WERE ASSEMBLED THERE THEY WERE ALL LOOKING AT HER VERY HARD SHE HAD BEGUN TO CHATTER AS SOON AS SHE JOINED HIM
1780-143478-0052 BUT SHE EXPRESSED A LIVELY WISH TO GO IN THE LITTLE STEAMER SHE DECLARED THAT SHE HAD A PASSION FOR STEAMBOATS THERE WAS ALWAYS SUCH A LOVELY BREEZE UPON THE WATER AND YOU SAW SUCH LOTS OF PEOPLE
1780-143478-0053 TO THE YOUNG MAN HIMSELF THEIR LITTLE EXCURSION WAS SO MUCH OF AN ESCAPADE AN ADVENTURE THAT EVEN ALLOWING FOR HER HABITUAL SENSE OF FREEDOM
1780-143478-0054 BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR HE WAS DISAPPOINTED DAISY MILLER WAS EXTREMELY ANIMATED SHE WAS IN CHARMING SPIRITS BUT SHE WAS APPARENTLY NOT AT ALL EXCITED
1780-143478-0055 SHE WAS NOT FLUTTERED SHE AVOIDED NEITHER HIS EYES NOR THOSE OF ANYONE ELSE SHE BLUSHED NEITHER WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HIM NOR WHEN SHE FELT THAT PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT HER
1780-143478-0056 AND WINTERBOURNE TOOK MUCH SATISFACTION IN HIS PRETTY COMPANION'S DISTINGUISHED AIR HE HAD BEEN A LITTLE AFRAID THAT SHE WOULD TALK LOUD LAUGH OVERMUCH AND EVEN PERHAPS DESIRE TO MOVE ABOUT THE BOAT A GOOD DEAL BUT HE QUITE FORGOT HIS FEARS
1780-143478-0057 HE SAT SMILING WITH HIS EYES UPON HER FACE WHILE WITHOUT MOVING FROM HER PLACE SHE DELIVERED HERSELF OF A GREAT NUMBER OF ORIGINAL REFLECTIONS IT WAS THE MOST CHARMING GARRULITY HE HAD EVER HEARD HE HAD ASSENTED TO THE IDEA THAT SHE WAS COMMON
1780-143478-0058 BUT WAS SHE SO AFTER ALL OR WAS HE SIMPLY GETTING USED TO HER COMMONNESS HER CONVERSATION WAS CHIEFLY OF WHAT METAPHYSICIANS TERM THE OBJECTIVE CAST BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN IT TOOK A SUBJECTIVE TURN
1780-143478-0059 WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU SO GRAVE ABOUT SHE SUDDENLY DEMANDED FIXING HER AGREEABLE EYES UPON WINTERBOURNE'S AM I GRAVE HE ASKED I HAD AN IDEA I WAS GRINNING FROM EAR TO EAR
1780-143478-0060 YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE TAKING ME TO A FUNERAL IF THAT'S A GRIN YOUR EARS ARE VERY NEAR TOGETHER SHOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DANCE A HORNPIPE ON THE DECK PRAY DO AND I'LL CARRY ROUND YOUR HAT IT WILL PAY THE EXPENSES OF OUR JOURNEY
1780-143478-0061 I NEVER WAS BETTER PLEASED IN MY LIFE MURMURED WINTERBOURNE SHE LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE LAUGH I LIKE TO MAKE YOU SAY THOSE THINGS YOU'RE A QUEER MIXTURE
1780-143478-0062 IN THE CASTLE AFTER THEY HAD LANDED THE SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT DECIDEDLY PREVAILED DAISY TRIPPED ABOUT THE VAULTED CHAMBERS RUSTLED HER SKIRTS IN THE CORKSCREW STAIRCASES FLIRTED BACK WITH A PRETTY LITTLE CRY AND A SHUDDER FROM THE EDGE OF THE OUBLIETTES
1780-143478-0063 AND TURNED A SINGULARLY WELL SHAPED EAR TO EVERYTHING THAT WINTERBOURNE TOLD HER ABOUT THE PLACE BUT HE SAW THAT SHE CARED VERY LITTLE FOR FEUDAL ANTIQUITIES
1780-143478-0064 AND WINTERBOURNE ARRANGED WITH THIS FUNCTIONARY THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE HURRIED THAT THEY SHOULD LINGER AND PAUSE WHEREVER THEY CHOSE THE CUSTODIAN INTERPRETED THE BARGAIN GENEROUSLY WINTERBOURNE ON HIS SIDE HAD BEEN GENEROUS AND ENDED BY LEAVING THEM QUITE TO THEMSELVES
1780-143478-0065 MISS MILLER'S OBSERVATIONS WERE NOT REMARKABLE FOR LOGICAL CONSISTENCY FOR ANYTHING SHE WANTED TO SAY SHE WAS SURE TO FIND A PRETEXT
1780-143478-0066 HIS FAMILY HIS PREVIOUS HISTORY HIS TASTES HIS HABITS HIS INTENTIONS AND FOR SUPPLYING INFORMATION UPON CORRESPONDING POINTS IN HER OWN PERSONALITY OF HER OWN TASTES HABITS AND INTENTIONS MISS MILLER WAS PREPARED TO GIVE THE MOST DEFINITE
1780-143478-0067 AND INDEED THE MOST FAVORABLE ACCOUNT WELL I HOPE YOU KNOW ENOUGH SHE SAID TO HER COMPANION
1780-143478-0068 I NEVER SAW A MAN THAT KNEW SO MUCH THE HISTORY OF BONIVARD HAD EVIDENTLY AS THEY SAY GONE INTO ONE EAR AND OUT OF THE OTHER BUT DAISY WENT ON TO SAY THAT SHE WISHED WINTERBOURNE WOULD TRAVEL WITH THEM AND GO ROUND WITH THEM THEY MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING IN THAT CASE
1780-143478-0069 DON'T YOU WANT TO COME AND TEACH RANDOLPH SHE ASKED WINTERBOURNE SAID THAT NOTHING COULD POSSIBLY PLEASE HIM SO MUCH BUT THAT HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY OTHER OCCUPATIONS OTHER OCCUPATIONS
1780-143478-0070 YOU ARE NOT IN BUSINESS THE YOUNG MAN ADMITTED THAT HE WAS NOT IN BUSINESS BUT HE HAD ENGAGEMENTS WHICH EVEN WITHIN A DAY OR TWO WOULD FORCE HIM TO GO BACK TO GENEVA OH BOTHER SHE SAID I DON'T BELIEVE IT
1780-143478-0071 BUT A FEW MOMENTS LATER WHEN HE WAS POINTING OUT TO HER THE PRETTY DESIGN OF AN ANTIQUE FIREPLACE SHE BROKE OUT IRRELEVANTLY YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU ARE GOING BACK TO GENEVA
1780-143478-0072 JUST AT THE LAST THE LAST
1780-143478-0073 AND FOR THE NEXT TEN MINUTES SHE DID NOTHING BUT CALL HIM HORRID POOR WINTERBOURNE WAS FAIRLY BEWILDERED NO YOUNG LADY HAD AS YET DONE HIM THE HONOR TO BE SO AGITATED BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS MOVEMENTS
1780-143478-0074 SHE OPENED FIRE UPON THE MYSTERIOUS CHARMER IN GENEVA WHOM SHE APPEARED TO HAVE INSTANTLY TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE WAS HURRYING BACK TO SEE HOW DID MISS DAISY MILLER KNOW THAT THERE WAS A CHARMER IN GENEVA WINTERBOURNE WHO DENIED THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A PERSON
1780-143478-0075 WAS QUITE UNABLE TO DISCOVER AND HE WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN AMAZEMENT AT THE RAPIDITY OF HER INDUCTION AND AMUSEMENT AT THE FRANKNESS OF HER PERSIFLAGE SHE SEEMED TO HIM IN ALL THIS AN EXTRAORDINARY MIXTURE OF INNOCENCE AND CRUDITY
1780-143478-0076 DOES SHE NEVER ALLOW YOU MORE THAN THREE DAYS AT A TIME ASKED DAISY IRONICALLY DOESN'T SHE GIVE YOU A VACATION IN SUMMER THERE'S NO ONE SO HARD WORKED BUT THEY CAN GET LEAVE TO GO OFF SOMEWHERE AT THIS SEASON I SUPPOSE IF YOU STAY ANOTHER DAY SHE'LL COME AFTER YOU IN THE BOAT
1780-143478-0077 DO WAIT OVER TILL FRIDAY AND I WILL GO DOWN TO THE LANDING TO SEE HER ARRIVE WINTERBOURNE BEGAN TO THINK HE HAD BEEN WRONG TO FEEL DISAPPOINTED IN THE TEMPER IN WHICH THE YOUNG LADY HAD EMBARKED IF HE HAD MISSED THE PERSONAL ACCENT THE PERSONAL ACCENT WAS NOW MAKING ITS APPEARANCE
1780-143478-0078 IT SOUNDED VERY DISTINCTLY AT LAST IN HER TELLING HIM SHE WOULD STOP TEASING HIM IF HE WOULD PROMISE HER SOLEMNLY TO COME DOWN TO ROME IN THE WINTER THAT'S NOT A DIFFICULT PROMISE TO MAKE SAID WINTERBOURNE MY AUNT HAS TAKEN AN APARTMENT IN ROME FOR THE WINTER
1780-143478-0079 AND HAS ALREADY ASKED ME TO COME AND SEE HER I DON'T WANT YOU TO COME FOR YOUR AUNT SAID DAISY I WANT YOU TO COME FOR ME AND THIS WAS THE ONLY ALLUSION THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS EVER TO HEAR HER MAKE TO HIS INVIDIOUS KINSWOMAN
1780-143478-0080 HE DECLARED THAT AT ANY RATE HE WOULD CERTAINLY COME AFTER THIS DAISY STOPPED TEASING
1780-143478-0081 THE YOUNG GIRL WAS VERY QUIET
1780-143478-0082 THE AMERICANS OF THE COURIER ASKED THIS LADY AH HAPPILY SAID WINTERBOURNE THE COURIER STAYED AT HOME SHE WENT WITH YOU ALL ALONE ALL ALONE
