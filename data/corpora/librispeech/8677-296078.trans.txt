8677-296078-0000 LITTLE FLORENCE ALL THE BOYS AND VERY LIKELY SOME OF THE GIRLS WHO HAVE GOT AS FAR AS THIS SECOND CHAPTER WILL GLANCE DOWN THE PAGE AND EXCLAIM DOLLS THEN THEY WILL ADD WHATEVER IS THEIR FAVORITE EXPRESSION OF SCORN
8677-296078-0001 AND PERHAPS MAKE A MOTION TO LAY THE BOOK DOWN WAIT A MOMENT GIRLS AND BOYS TOO I ADVISE YOU TO READ ON AND SEE WHAT CAME IN THIS CASE OF PLAYING WITH DOLLS THERE WERE A GOOD MANY THOUSANDS OF BOYS IN ENGLAND AT THAT TIME
8677-296078-0002 IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN BADLY OFF WHEN THE TERRIBLE FIFTIES CAME IF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE HAD NOT PLAYED WITH HER DOLLS READ ON AND SEE FOR YOURSELVES FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE LOVED HER DOLLS DEARLY
8677-296078-0003 AND TOOK THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CARE OF THEM AND YET THEY WERE ALWAYS DELICATE AND GIVEN TO SUDDEN AND ALARMING ILLNESSES A DOLL NEVER KNEW WHEN SHE MIGHT BE TOLD THAT SHE WAS VERY ILL AND UNDRESSED AND PUT TO BED
8677-296078-0004 THOUGH SHE MIGHT BUT JUST HAVE GOT ON HER NEW FROCK THEN MAMMA FLORENCE WOULD WAIT UPON HER TENDERLY SMOOTHING HER PILLOW BATHING HER FOREHEAD OR RUBBING HER POOR BACK AND BRINGING HER ALL KINDS OF GOOD THINGS IN THE DOLL HOUSE DISHES
8677-296078-0005 THE DOLL MIGHT FEEL VERY MUCH BETTER THE NEXT DAY AND THINK IT WAS TIME TO GET UP AND PUT ON THE NEW FROCK AGAIN BUT SHE WAS VERY APT TO HAVE A RELAPSE AND GO BACK TO BED AND GRUEL AGAIN
8677-296078-0006 ONCE AT LEAST BEFORE SHE WAS ALLOWED TO RECOVER ENTIRELY THE TRUTH IS FLORENCE WAS BORN TO BE A NURSE AND A SICK DOLL WAS DEARER TO HER THAN A STRONG AND HEALTHY ONE SO I FEAR HER DOLLS WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALIDS MOST OF THE TIME
8677-296078-0007 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR PARTHENOPE'S LITTLE FAMILY WHO OFTEN REQUIRED THEIR AUNT FLORENCE'S CARE THESE DOLLS WERE VERY UNLUCKY OR ELSE THEIR MAMMA WAS VERY CARELESS YOU CAN CALL IT WHICHEVER YOU LIKE
8677-296078-0008 THEY WERE ALWAYS TUMBLING DOWN AND BREAKING THEIR HEADS OR LOSING ARMS AND LEGS OR BURNING THEMSELVES AT THE NURSERY FIRE OR SUFFERING FROM DOLL'S CONSUMPTION THAT DREADFUL COMPLAINT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS LOSS OF SAWDUST
8677-296078-0009 WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPENED AUNT FLORENCE WAS CALLED IN AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND SHE SET THE FRACTURES AND SALVED THE BURNS AND STOPPED THE FLOW OF SAWDUST AND PROVED HERSELF IN EVERY WAY A MOST SKILLFUL NURSERY SURGEON AND PHYSICIAN
8677-296078-0010 SO IT WAS THAT UNCONSCIOUSLY AND IN PLAY FLORENCE BEGAN HER TRAINING FOR HER LIFE WORK SHE WAS HAVING LESSONS OF COURSE ARITHMETIC AND ALL THE OTHER PROPER THINGS
8677-296078-0011 AND STUDIED REGULARLY AND HAD MUSIC AND DRAWING LESSONS BESIDES AND HER FATHER TAUGHT HER TO LOVE ENGLISH LITERATURE AND LATER OPENED TO HER THE GREAT DOORS MARKED LATIN AND GREEK
8677-296078-0012 HER MOTHER MEANTIME TAUGHT HER ALL KINDS OF HANDIWORK AND BEFORE SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD SHE COULD HEMSTITCH AND SEAM AND EMBROIDER THESE THINGS WERE ALL GOOD AND VERY GOOD WITHOUT THEM SHE COULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ALL SHE DID
8677-296078-0013 ALL THE OTHER LEARNING WAS GOING TO HELP THAT WONDERFUL LEARNING THAT BEGAN WITH NURSING THE SICK DOLLS SOON SHE WAS TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP IN HER PROFESSION
8677-296078-0014 THE LITTLE FINGERS GROWN SO SKILLFUL BY BANDAGING WAXEN AND CHINA ARMS AND LEGS WERE NOW TO SAVE A LIVING LOVING CREATURE FROM DEATH TO EVERY ENGLISH CHILD THIS STORY IS A NURSERY TALE
8677-296078-0015 NO DOUBT IT IS TO MANY AMERICAN CHILDREN ALSO YET IT IS ONE THAT NO ONE CAN EVER TIRE OF HEARING SO I SHALL TELL IT AGAIN
8677-296078-0016 AND OLD PEGGY WHO WAS TOO OLD TO WORK AND LIVED IN A PLEASANT GREEN PADDOCK WITH NOTHING TO DO BUT AMUSE HERSELF AND CROP GRASS ALL DAY LONG PERHAPS PEGGY FOUND THIS TIRESOME
8677-296078-0017 FOR WHENEVER SHE SAW FLORENCE AT THE GATE SHE WOULD TOSS HER HEAD AND WHINNY AND COME TROTTING UP TO THE GATE GOOD MORNING PEGGY FLORENCE WOULD SAY WOULD YOU LIKE AN APPLE
8677-296078-0018 AND MORE PLEASE HORSE LANGUAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE COMPARED TO ENGLISH AND HAS NO GRAMMAR WELL ONE DAY FLORENCE WAS RIDING HER PONY IN COMPANY WITH HER FRIEND THE VICAR THIS GOOD MAN LOVED ALL LIVING CREATURES
8677-296078-0019 BUT THERE WERE FEW DEARER TO HIM THAN FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THEY HAD THE SAME TASTES AND FEELINGS BOTH LOVED TO HELP AND COMFORT ALL WHO WERE IN TROUBLE SORROW NEED SICKNESS OR ANY OTHER ADVERSITY
8677-296078-0020 HE HAD STUDIED MEDICINE BEFORE HE BECAME A CLERGYMAN AND SO WAS ABLE TO TELL HER MANY THINGS ABOUT THE CARE OF THE SICK AND INJURED HERE WAS ANOTHER TEACHER I SUPPOSE EVERYONE WE KNOW COULD TEACH US SOMETHING GOOD IF WE WERE READY TO LEARN
8677-296078-0021 AS I SAID FLORENCE AND THE VICAR WERE RIDING ALONG ON THE GREEN DOWNS AND HERE I MUST STOP AGAIN A MOMENT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE DOWNS ARE FOR WHEN I WAS A CHILD I USED TO WONDER
8677-296078-0022 THEY ARE GREAT ROUNDED HILLS COVERED WITH CLOSE THICK TURF LIKE A VELVET CARPET THEY SPREAD IN LONG SMOOTH GREEN BILLOWS MILES AND MILES OF THEM
8677-296078-0023 THE SLOPES SO GENTLE THAT IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO DRIVE OR RIDE ON THEM ONLY YOU MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO GO NEAR THE EDGE WHERE THE GREEN BREAKS OFF SUDDENLY AND A WHITE CHALK CLIFF GOES DOWN DOWN HUNDREDS OF FEET
8677-296078-0024 TO THE BLUE SEA TOSSING AND TUMBLING BELOW THESE ARE THE WHITE CLIFFS OF ENGLAND THAT YOU HAVE SO OFTEN READ ABOUT AM I NEVER GOING ON WITH THE STORY YES HAVE PATIENCE THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME
8677-296078-0025 THERE WERE MANY SHEEP ON THE DOWNS AND THERE WAS ONE SPECIAL FLOCK THAT FLORENCE KNEW VERY WELL IT BELONGED TO OLD ROGER A SHEPHERD WHO HAD OFTEN WORKED FOR HER FATHER ROGER AND HIS GOOD DOG CAP WERE BOTH FRIENDS OF FLORENCE'S
8677-296078-0026 AND SHE WAS USED TO SEEING THEM ON THE DOWNS THE SHEEP IN A MORE OR LESS ORDERLY COMPACT FLOCK CAP GUARDING THEM AND DRIVING BACK ANY STRAGGLERS WHO WENT NIBBLING OFF TOWARD THE CLIFF EDGE BUT TO DAY THERE SEEMED NO ORDER ANYWHERE
8677-296078-0027 THE SHEEP WERE SCATTERED IN TWOS AND THREES STRAYING HITHER AND THITHER AND OLD ROGER ALONE WAS TRYING TO COLLECT THEM AND APPARENTLY HAVING A HARD TIME OF IT THE VICAR SAW HIS TROUBLE AND RODE UP TO HIM
8677-296078-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER ROGER HE ASKED KINDLY WHERE IS YOUR DOG THE BOYS HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT HIM SIR REPLIED THE OLD MAN THEY HAVE BROKEN HIS LEG POOR BEAST AND HE WILL NEVER BE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AGAIN
8677-296078-0029 I SHALL HAVE TO TAKE A BIT OF CORD AND PUT AN END TO HIS MISERY OH CRIED FLORENCE WHO HAD RIDDEN UP WITH THE VICAR POOR CAP ARE YOU SURE HIS LEG IS BROKEN ROGER YES MISS IT'S BROKE SURE ENOUGH
8677-296078-0030 BEST PUT HIM OUT OF HIS PAIN I SAYS NO NO CRIED FLORENCE NOT TILL WE HAVE TRIED TO HELP HIM WHERE IS HE
8677-296078-0031 POOR CAP'S DAYS IS OVER AH HE WERE A GOOD DOG DO EVERYTHING BUT SPEAK HE COULD AND WENT AS NEAR TO THAT AS A DUMB BEAST COULD I'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER LIKE HIM
8677-296078-0032 WHILE THE OLD MAN LAMENTED FLORENCE WAS LOOKING EAGERLY IN THE FACE OF THE CLERGYMAN HE MET HER LOOK WITH A SMILE AND NOD WE WILL GO AND SEE HE SAID AND OFF THEY RODE LEAVING ROGER SHAKING HIS HEAD AND CALLING TO THE SHEEP
8677-296078-0033 THEY SOON REACHED THE COTTAGE THE DOOR WAS FASTENED AND WHEN THEY TRIED TO OPEN IT A FURIOUS BARKING WAS HEARD WITHIN
8677-296078-0034 THEY ENTERED AND THERE LAY CAP ON THE BRICK FLOOR HELPLESS AND WEAK BUT STILL BARKING AS HARD AS HE COULD AT WHAT HE SUPPOSED TO BE INTRUDERS WHEN HE SAW FLORENCE AND THE LITTLE BOY HE STOPPED BARKING AND WAGGED HIS TAIL FEEBLY
8677-296078-0035 THEN HE CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE TABLE WHERE HE LAY DRAGGED HIMSELF TO FLORENCE'S FEET AND LOOKED UP PITIFULLY IN HER FACE SHE KNELT DOWN BY HIM AND SOOTHED AND PETTED AND TALKED TO HIM WHILE THE GOOD CLERGYMAN EXAMINED THE INJURED LEG
8677-296078-0036 IT WAS DREADFULLY SWOLLEN AND EVERY TOUCH WAS PAINFUL BUT CAP KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE HANDS THAT HURT WERE TRYING TO HELP HIM AND THOUGH HE MOANED AND WINCED HE LICKED THE HANDS AND MADE NO EFFORT TO DRAW THE LEG AWAY
8677-296078-0037 IS IT BROKEN ASKED FLORENCE ANXIOUSLY NO SAID THE VICAR NO BONES ARE BROKEN THERE'S NO REASON WHY CAP SHOULD NOT RECOVER ALL HE NEEDS IS CARE AND NURSING FLORENCE QUIETLY LAID DOWN HER RIDING WHIP AND TUCKED UP HER SLEEVES
8677-296078-0038 WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST SHE SAID WELL SAID THE VICAR I THINK A HOT COMPRESS IS THE THING FLORENCE LOOKED PUZZLED THE DOLLS HAD NEVER HAD HOT COMPRESSES WHAT IS IT SHE ASKED
8677-296078-0039 QUICKLY SHE TORE THE FROCK INTO STRIPS OF SUITABLE WIDTH AND LENGTH
8677-296078-0040 AS THE HEAT DREW OUT THE INFLAMMATION AND PAIN CAP LOOKED UP AT THE LITTLE HELPER ALL HIS SIMPLE DOG HEART SHINING IN HIS EYES THE LOOK SANK INTO THE CHILD'S HEART AND DEEPENED THE TENDERNESS ALREADY THERE ANOTHER STEP
8677-296078-0041 FLORENCE CAME AGAIN THE NEXT DAY TO BANDAGE THE LEG
