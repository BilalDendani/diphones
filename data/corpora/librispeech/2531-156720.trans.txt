2531-156720-0000 THERE WAS A THRASHING SOUND IN THE THICKET AND THE PHOENIX APPEARED LOOKING VERY RUMPLED AND YAWNING BEHIND ITS WING GREETINGS MY BOY IT CRIED A SPLENDID MORNING THEN THE PHOENIX CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PAPER BAG IN DAVID'S HAND AND SWALLOWED IN A SUGGESTIVE WAY
2531-156720-0001 DAVID THRUST THE BAG OF COOKIES BEHIND HIS BACK NOW PHOENIX HE SAID FIRMLY YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T GO AWAY TO SOUTH AMERICA YOU SAID LAST NIGHT THAT IT COULD BE ARRANGED SO LET'S ARRANGE IT RIGHT NOW UNTIL WE DO NOT ONE
2531-156720-0002 THE PHOENIX DREW ITSELF UP INDIGNANTLY MY VERY DEAR FELLOW IT SAID YOU WOUND ME YOU CUT ME TO THE QUICK I WILL NOT BE BRIBED I IT STOPPED AND SWALLOWED AGAIN OH WELL IT CONTINUED MORE MILDLY
2531-156720-0003 ONE DOES NOT FIGHT FATE DOES ONE I SUPPOSE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I MUST ACCEPT IT'S SETTLED THEN DAVID CRIED JOYFULLY SO THEY SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS TOGETHER
2531-156720-0004 WORDS FAIL ME I'M GLAD YOU LIKE THEM DAVID SAID POLITELY AND NOW MY BOY CONTINUED THE PHOENIX AS IT SETTLED BACK COMFORTABLY I HAVE BEEN THINKING YESTERDAY YOU SHOWED AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN MY PROBLEMS AND ASKED INTELLIGENT QUESTIONS
2531-156720-0005 YOU DID NOT SCOFF AS OTHERS MIGHT HAVE DONE YOU HAVE VERY RARE QUALITIES DAVID FLUSHED AND MUMBLED DENIALS DO NOT BE SO MODEST MY BOY I SPEAK THE TRUTH IT CAME TO ME THAT SUCH A MIND AS YOURS HAVING THESE QUALITIES SHOULD BE FURTHER CULTIVATED AND REFINED
2531-156720-0006 AND I SHOULD BE AVOIDING MY CLEAR CUT DUTY IF I DID NOT TAKE THIS TASK IN HAND MYSELF OF COURSE I SUPPOSE SOME ATTEMPT TO EDUCATE YOU HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE HAS IT NOT WELL I GO TO SCHOOL IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN NOT NOW THOUGH BECAUSE IT'S SUMMER VACATION
2531-156720-0007 AND WHAT DO THEY TEACH YOU THERE OH READING AND WRITING AND ARITHMETIC AND THINGS LIKE THAT AHA SAID THE PHOENIX TRIUMPHANTLY JUST AS I SUSPECTED A CLASSICAL EDUCATION
2531-156720-0008 UNDERSTAND ME I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST A CLASSICAL EDUCATION AS SUCH I REALIZE THAT MATHEMATICS GREEK AND LATIN ARE EXCELLENT FOR THE DISCIPLINE OF THE MIND BUT IN THE BROAD VIEW A CLASSICAL EDUCATION IS NOT A TRUE EDUCATION
2531-156720-0009 LIFE IS REAL LIFE IS EARNEST ONE MUST FACE IT WITH A PRACTICAL EDUCATION THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE MY DEAR FELLOW CLASSICAL EDUCATION COMPLETELY IGNORES THEM FOR EXAMPLE HOW DO YOU TELL A TRUE UNICORN FROM A FALSE ONE I
2531-156720-0010 OH SAID DAVID DO YOU MEAN ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME LESSONS THROUGH HIS MIND FLASHED A PICTURE OF THE PHOENIX WITH SPECTACLES ON ITS BEAK AND A RULER IN ITS WING WRITING OUT SENTENCES ON A BLACKBOARD
2531-156720-0011 THE THOUGHT GAVE HIM A SINKING FEELING AFTER ALL IT WAS SUMMER AND SUMMER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE VACATION TIME AND WHAT AN EDUCATION IT WILL BE THE PHOENIX WENT ON IGNORING HIS QUESTION ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT EQUAL
2531-156720-0012 THE FULL BENEFIT OF MY VAST KNOWLEDGE PLUS A NUMBER OF TRIPS TO OH TRAVELING SAID DAVID SUDDENLY FEELING MUCH BETTER THAT'S DIFFERENT OH PHOENIX THAT'LL BE WONDERFUL WHERE WILL WE GO EVERYWHERE MY BOY SAID THE PHOENIX WITH AN AIRY WAVE OF ITS WING

2531-156720-0017 DO NOT BE SO DENSE MY DEAR FELLOW I SHALL CARRY YOU ON MY BACK OF COURSE OH SAID DAVID WEAKLY ON YOUR ON YOUR BACK ARE YOU SURE THAT ISN'T THERE SOME OTHER I MEAN CAN YOU DO IT THE PHOENIX DREW ITSELF UP TO ITS FULL HEIGHT
2531-156720-0018 HE STEPPED BACK QUICKLY WITH A SHUDDER LET'S LET'S DO IT TOMORROW HE QUAVERED NONSENSE SAID THE PHOENIX FIRMLY NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT
2531-156720-0019 THE GREAT WINGS WERE OUTSTRETCHED DAVID GULPED CLUTCHED THE PHOENIX'S NECK TIGHTLY AND SHUT HIS EYES HE FELT A HOPPING SENSATION THEN A LONG SICKENING DOWNWARD SWOOP THAT SEEMED TO LEAVE HIS STOMACH FAR BEHIND
2531-156720-0020 A TREMENDOUS RUSH OF AIR SNATCHED AT HIS SHIRT HE OPENED HIS EYES AND CHOKED WITH FRIGHT THE GROUND BELOW WAS RUSHING UP TO MEET THEM SWAYING AND REVOLVING SOMETHING WAS TERRIBLY WRONG THE PHOENIX WAS BREATHING IN HOARSE GASPS
2531-156720-0021 ITS WINGS WERE POUNDING THE AIR FRANTICALLY NOW THEY HAD TURNED BACK THE SCARP LOOMED BEFORE THEM SOLID AND BLANK ABOVE THEM HIGH ABOVE THEM WAS THE LEDGE IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY WOULD NOT GET BACK TO IT UP UP UP
2531-156720-0022 WITH A TREMENDOUS SURGE OF ITS WINGS THE PHOENIX MANAGED TO GET ONE CLAW OVER THE EDGE AND TO SEIZE THE BRANCH OF A BUSH IN ITS BEAK DAVID'S LEGS SLIPPED FROM THE BIRD'S BACK HE DANGLED OVER THE ABYSS FROM THE OUTSTRETCHED NECK AND PRAYED
2531-156720-0023 COULD HAVE DONE EVEN THIS MUCH THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT YOU ARE A LOT PUFF HEAVIER THAN YOU LOOK I HOPE YOU ARE NOT BEING OVERFED AT HOME I I DON'T KNOW SAID DAVID WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS GOING TO BE SICK
2531-156720-0024 WELL MY COURSE IS CLEAR SAID THE PHOENIX FIRMLY I MUST PRACTICE SETTING UP EXERCISES ROADWORK AND WHAT NOT RIGOROUS DIET LOTS OF SLEEP REGULAR HOURS COURAGE MY DEAR FELLOW WE SHALL DO IT YET
2531-156720-0025 THEN THERE WOULD BE A FIFTEEN MINUTE REST AND REFRESHMENT PERIOD AND WHEN THAT WAS OVER THE PHOENIX WOULD LAUNCH ITSELF INTO THE AIR THIS WAS THE PART DAVID LIKED BEST IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SIGHT
2531-156720-0026 WHEELED IN CIRCLES SHOT STRAIGHT UP LIKE A ROCKET PLUNGED HOVERED LOOPED ROLLED SOARED FLUTTERED NOW AND THEN IT WOULD SWOOP BACK TO THE LEDGE BESIDE DAVID AND WIPE THE SWEAT FROM ITS BROW I TRUST YOU SEE SIGNS OF PROGRESS MY BOY
2531-156720-0027 DAVID WOULD WRAP THE WET TOWEL AROUND THE PHOENIX'S NECK YOU'RE DOING BETTER AND BETTER PHOENIX I ESPECIALLY LIKE THAT PART WHERE YOU TWIST OVER ON YOUR BACK AND LOOP AND PLUNGE ALL AT THE SAME TIME I DO PERFORM THAT RATHER WELL DON'T I
2531-156720-0028 IT IS NOT EASY BUT JUST THE THING FOR ACQUIRING OUCH MUSCLE TONE ARE THERE ANY MORE COOKIES AH THERE ARE DELICIOUS AS I WAS SAYING LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU MY BOY IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED TRY TRY AGAIN
2531-156720-0029 THE PHOENIX WOULD TAKE WING AGAIN AND DAVID WOULD SETTLE BACK AGAINST A ROCK AND WATCH SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT OF THE EDUCATION HE WAS TO GET SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HOW NICE IT WOULD BE IF HE COULD FLY AND SOMETIMES HE DID NOT THINK AT ALL BUT JUST SAT WITH HIS EYES HALF SHUT
2531-156720-0030 FEELING THE SUNLIGHT ON HIS FACE AND LISTENING TO THE RUSTLE OF THE WIND IN THE THICKET AT THE END OF THE WEEK THE PHOENIX AFTER A BRILLIANT DISPLAY OF ACROBATICS LANDED ON THE LEDGE CLASPED ITS WINGS BEHIND ITS BACK AND LOOKED SOLEMNLY AT DAVID
