5445-21282-0073 WHO HAS LIVED ON KINDLY TERMS WITH THE GENTRY AND SHARED THEIR STANDARDS AND FOR YEARS AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE HURD HAD ALLOWED HER TO GOVERN HIM HE HAD BEEN SO PATIENT SO HARD WORKING

5445-21282-0075 THE BURDEN OF QUICK COMING CHILDREN THE BAD SANITARY CONDITIONS OF THEIR WRETCHED COTTAGE AND POOR HEALTH HAD MADE THEIR LIVES ONE LONG AND SORDID STRUGGLE BUT FOR YEARS HE HAD BORNE HIS LOAD WITH EXTRAORDINARY PATIENCE HE AND HIS COULD JUST EXIST
5445-21282-0076 AND THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN YOUTH THE LONELY VICTIM OF HIS NEIGHBOURS SCORN HAD FOUND A WOMAN TO GIVE HIM ALL HERSELF AND CHILDREN TO LOVE HENCE YEARS OF SUBMISSION A HIDDEN FLOWERING TIME FOR BOTH OF THEM TILL THAT LAST AWFUL WINTER
5445-21282-0077 AND HALF THE ABLE BODIED MEN OF MELLOR HAD TRAMPED UP INTO THE SMOKE AS THE VILLAGE PUT IT IN SEARCH OF LONDON WORK THEN OUT OF ACTUAL SHEER STARVATION THAT VERY RARE EXCUSE OF THE POACHER HURD HAD GONE ONE NIGHT AND SNARED A HARE
5445-21282-0078 ON THE MELLOR LAND WOULD THE WIFE AND MOTHER EVER FORGET THE PURE ANIMAL SATISFACTION OF THAT MEAL OR THE FEARFUL JOY OF THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN HE GOT THREE SHILLINGS FROM A LOCAL PUBLICAN FOR A HARE AND TWO RABBITS
5445-21282-0079 BUT AFTER THE FIRST RELIEF MINTA HAD GONE IN FEAR AND TREMBLING FOR THE OLD WOODCRAFT REVIVED IN HURD AND THE OLD PASSION FOR THE FIELDS AND THEIR CHANCES
5445-21282-0080 WHICH HE HAD FELT AS A LAD BEFORE HIS WATCHER'S PLACE HAD BEEN MADE INTOLERABLE TO HIM BY GEORGE WESTALL'S BULLYING HE BECAME EXCITED UNMANAGEABLE
5445-21282-0081 VERY SOON HE WAS NO LONGER CONTENT WITH MELLOR WHERE SINCE THE DEATH OF YOUNG HAROLD THE HEIR THE KEEPERS HAD BEEN DISMISSED AND WHAT REMAINED OF A ONCE NUMEROUS HEAD OF GAME LAY OPEN TO THE WILES OF ALL THE BOLD SPIRITS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
5445-21282-0082 HE MUST NEEDS GO ON TO THOSE WOODS OF LORD MAXWELL'S WHICH GIRDLED THE MELLOR ESTATE ON THREE SIDES AND HERE HE CAME ONCE MORE ACROSS HIS ENEMY FOR GEORGE WESTALL WAS NOW IN THE FAR BETTER PAID SERVICE OF THE COURT AND A VERY CLEVER KEEPER
5445-21282-0083 WITH DESIGNS ON THE HEAD KEEPER'S POST WHENEVER IT MIGHT BE VACANT IN THE CASE OF A POACHER HE HAD THE SCENT OF ONE OF HIS OWN HARES IT WAS KNOWN TO HIM IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME THAT THAT LOW CASELTY FELLOW HURD
5445-21282-0084 WAS ATTACKING HIS GAME HURD NOTWITHSTANDING WAS CUNNING ITSELF AND WESTALL LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM IN VAIN MEANWHILE ALL THE OLD HATRED BETWEEN THE TWO MEN REVIVED
5445-21282-0085 HURD DRANK THIS WINTER MORE THAN HE HAD EVER DRUNK YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO KEEP ON GOOD TERMS WITH ONE OR TWO PUBLICANS WHO ACTED AS RECEIVERS OF THE POACHED GAME OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT WESTALL PURSUED HIM INTO THESE LOW DENS
5445-21282-0086 THE KEEPER BIG BURLY PROSPEROUS WOULD SPEAK TO HIM WITH INSOLENT PATRONAGE WATCHING HIM ALL THE TIME OR WITH THE OLD BRUTALITY WHICH HURD DARED NOT RESENT ONLY IN HIS EXCITABLE DWARF'S SENSE
5445-21282-0087 HATE GREW AND THROVE VERY SOON TO MONSTROUS PROPORTIONS WESTALL'S MENACING FIGURE DARKENED ALL HIS SKY FOR HIM HIS POACHING BESIDES A MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD BECAME MORE AND MORE A SILENT DUEL BETWEEN HIM AND HIS BOYHOOD'S TYRANT
5445-21282-0088 AND NOW AFTER SEVEN MONTHS OF REGULAR FIELD WORK AND RESPECTABLE LIVING IT WAS ALL TO BEGIN AGAIN WITH THE NEW WINTER THE SAME SHUDDERS AND TERRORS THE SAME SHAMES BEFORE THE GENTRY AND MISTER HARDEN THE SOFT TIMID WOMAN WITH HER CONSCIENCE
5445-21282-0089 SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS GLAD TO FAIL THERE WAS A CERTAIN EASE AND JAUNTINESS IN HIS AIR TO NIGHT

5445-21282-0092 HE CARRIED HIM IN TO THE FIRE AND SAT HIM ON HIS KNEES THE LITTLE EMACIATED CREATURE FLUSHED WITH THE PLEASURE OF HIS FATHER'S COMPANY PLAYED CONTENTEDLY IN THE INTERVALS OF COUGHING WITH THE SHINING CHESTNUTS OR ATE HIS SLICE OF THE FINE PEAR
5445-21282-0093 WHICH PROVED TO BE THE SUMMAT ELSE OF PROMISE THE CURTAINS WERE CLOSE DRAWN THE PARAFFIN LAMP FLARED ON THE TABLE AND AS THE SAVOURY SMELL OF THE HARE AND ONIONS ON THE FIRE FILLED THE KITCHEN
5445-21282-0094 THE WHOLE FAMILY GATHERED ROUND WATCHING FOR THE MOMENT OF EATING THE FIRE PLAYED ON THE THIN LEGS AND PINCHED FACES OF THE CHILDREN ON THE BABY'S CRADLE IN THE FURTHER CORNER ON THE MOTHER RED EYED STILL BUT ABLE TO SMILE AND TALK AGAIN
5445-21282-0095 ON THE STRANGE CELTIC FACE AND MATTED HAIR OF THE DWARF FAMILY AFFECTION AND THE SATISFACTION OF THE SIMPLER PHYSICAL NEEDS THESE THINGS MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE POOR FOR THIS HOUR TO NIGHT
5445-21282-0096 MEANWHILE IN THE LANE OUTSIDE MARCELLA AS SHE WALKED HOME PASSED A TALL BROAD SHOULDERED MAN IN A VELVETEEN SUIT AND GAITERS HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND TWO DOGS BEHIND HIM
5445-21282-0097 HIS POCKETS BULGING ON EITHER SIDE HE WALKED WITH A KIND OF MILITARY AIR AND TOUCHED HIS CAP TO HER AS HE PASSED MARCELLA BARELY NODDED TYRANT AND BULLY SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF WITH MISSUS HURD'S STORY IN HER MIND
5445-21282-0098 YET NO DOUBT HE IS A VALUABLE KEEPER LORD MAXWELL WOULD BE SORRY TO LOSE HIM IT IS THE SYSTEM MAKES SUCH MEN AND MUST HAVE THEM THE CLATTER OF A PONY CARRIAGE DISTURBED HER THOUGHTS
