7705-101579-0000 HIGH WATER IT WAS NEARING THE MIDDLE OF JUNE AND IT WAS GETTING TO BE A VERY HOT JUNE AT THAT
7705-101579-0001 THEN THE SKY THREATENED FOR A DAY AND AFTER THAT THEY PLODDED IN THE RAIN THANK THE LORD THAT'S DONE WITH SIGHED PARK WHEN HE SAW THE LAST OF THE HERD CLIMB ALL DRIPPING UP THE NORTH BANK OF THE MILK RIVER
7705-101579-0002 YUH NOTICE HOW THE RIVER'S COMING UP A DAY LATER AND WE'D HAVE HAD TO HOLD THE HERD ON THE OTHER SIDE NO TELLING HOW LONG IT IS HIGHER THAN USUAL I NOTICED THAT THURSTON AGREED ABSENTLY
7705-101579-0003 HE WONDERED IF SHE WOULD BE AT HOME HE COULD EASILY RIDE DOWN THERE AND FIND OUT IT WASN'T FAR NOT A QUARTER OF A MILE BUT HE ASSURED HIMSELF THAT HE WASN'T GOING AND THAT HE WAS NOT QUITE A FOOL HE HOPED
7705-101579-0004 EVEN IF SHE WERE AT HOME WHAT GOOD COULD THAT POSSIBLY DO HIM JUST GIVE HIM SEVERAL BAD NIGHTS WHEN HE WOULD LIE IN HIS CORNER OF THE TENT AND LISTEN TO THE BOYS SNORING WITH A DIFFERENT KEY FOR EVERY MAN
7705-101579-0005 SUCH NIGHTS WERE NOT PLEASANT NOR WERE THE THOUGHTS THAT CAUSED THEM
7705-101579-0006 THE HOUSE HALF HIDDEN AMONG THE COTTONWOODS THROUGH THE LAST HOURS OF THE AFTERNOON HE WATCHED IT HUNGRILY THE BIG CORRAL RAN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND HE NOTED IDLY THAT THREE PANELS OF THE FENCE EXTENDED OUT INTO THE RIVER
7705-101579-0007 AND THAT THE MUDDY WATER WAS CREEPING STEADILY UP UNTIL AT SUNDOWN THE POSTS OF THE FIRST PANEL BARELY SHOWED ABOVE THE WATER PARK CAME UP TO HIM AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE LITTLE VALLEY
7705-101579-0008 THERE AIN'T A JUNE FLOOD THAT DON'T PUT HIS CORRAL UNDER WATER AND SOME UH THESE DAYS IT'S GOING TO GET THE HOUSE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO DIG A WELL BACK ON HIGH GROUND HE'D RATHER TAKE CHANCES ON HAVING THE WHOLE BUSINESS WASHED OFF THE FACE UH THE EARTH
7705-101579-0009 THERE MUST BE DANGER OF IT THIS YEAR IF EVER THURSTON OBSERVED UNEASILY THE RIVER IS COMING UP PRETTY FAST IT SEEMS TO ME IT MUST HAVE RAISED THREE FEET SINCE WE CROSSED THIS AFTERNOON
7705-101579-0010 I'LL COURSE THERE'S DANGER WITH ALL THAT SNOW COMING OUT UH THE MOUNTAINS AND LIKE AS NOT JACK'S IN SHELLANNE ROOSTING ON SOMEBODY'S POOL TABLE AND TELLING IT SCARY
7705-101579-0011 WHERE YUH GOING BUD I'M GOING TO RIDE DOWN THERE THURSTON ANSWERED CONSTRAINEDLY THE WOMEN MAY BE ALL ALONE
7705-101579-0012 HE HAD A POOR OPINION OF JACK AND RESENTED EVEN THAT SLIGHT RELATION TO MONA THE ROAD WAS SOGGY WITH THE RAIN WHICH FELL STEADILY DOWN IN THE BOTTOM THE LOW PLACES IN THE ROAD WERE ALREADY UNDER WATER
7705-101579-0013 AND THE RIVER WIDENING ALMOST PERCEPTIBLY IN ITS HEADLONG RUSH DOWN THE NARROW VALLEY CREPT INCH BY INCH UP ITS LOW BANKS WHEN THEY GALLOPED INTO THE YARD WHICH SLOPED FROM THE HOUSE GENTLY DOWN TO THE RIVER FIFTY YARDS AWAY
7705-101579-0014 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR HER EYES GREETED HIM WITH A CERTAIN WISTFUL EXPRESSION THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN IN THEM BEFORE HE WAS GUILTY OF WISHING THAT PARK HAD STAYED IN CAMP
7705-101579-0015 SHE WELCOMED BUT SHE WAS CAREFUL AFTER THAT FIRST SWIFT GLANCE TO LOOK AT PARK JACK WASN'T AT CAMP WAS HE HE WENT TO TOWN THIS MORNING AND I LOOKED FOR HI BACK LONG BEFORE NOW
7705-101579-0016 BUT IT'S A MISTAKE EVER TO LOOK FOR JACK UNTIL HE'S ACTUALLY IN SIGHT PARK SMILED VAGUELY HE WAS AFRAID IT WOULD NOT BE POLITE TO AGREE WITH HER AS EMPHATICALLY AS HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DONE
7705-101579-0017 BUT THURSTON HAD NO SMILE READY POLITE OR OTHERWISE INSTEAD HE DREW DOWN HIS BROWS IN A WAY NOT COMPLIMENTARY TO JACK WHERE IS YOUR MOTHER HE ASKED ALMOST PEREMPTORILY
7705-101579-0018 MAMMA WENT TO GREAT FALLS LAST WEEK SHE TOLD HIM PRIMLY JUST GRAZING HIM WITH ONE OF HER IMPERSONAL GLANCES WHICH NEARLY DROVE HIM TO DESPERATION AUNT MARY HAS TYPHOID FEVER
7705-101579-0019 THERE SEEMS TO BE SO MUCH OF THAT THIS SPRING AND THEY SENT FOR MAMMA SHE'S SUCH A SPLENDID NURSE YOU KNOW THURSTON DID KNOW BUT HE PASSED OVER THE SUBJECT AND YOU'RE ALONE HE DEMANDED
7705-101579-0020 CERTAINLY NOT AREN'T YOU TWO HERE MONA COULD BE VERY PERT WHEN SHE TRIED JACK AND I ARE HOLDING DOWN THE RANCH JUST NOW THE BOYS ARE ALL ON ROUNDUP OF COURSE JACK WENT TO TOWN TODAY TO SEE SOME ONE
7705-101579-0021 IT WAS PARK STILL TRYING TO BE POLITE AND NOT COMMIT HIMSELF ON THE SUBJECT OF JACK THE SOME ONE WHOM JACK WENT OFTENEST TO SEE WAS THE BARTENDER IN THE PALACE SALOON BUT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO TELL HER THAT
7705-101579-0022 THE RIVER'S COMING UP PRETTY FAST MONA HE VENTURED DON'T YUH THINK YUH OUGHT TO PULL OUT AND GO VISITING NO I DON'T MONA'S TONE WAS VERY DECIDED
7705-101579-0023 I WOULDN'T DROP DOWN ON A NEIGHBOR WITHOUT WARNING JUST BECAUSE THE RIVER HAPPENS TO BE COMING UP IT HAS COME UP EVERY JUNE SINCE WE'VE BEEN LIVING HERE AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL OF THEM AT THE WORST IT NEVER CAME INSIDE THE GATE
7705-101579-0024 PROBABLY SHE DID NOT MEAN IT AT ANY RATE THE BLOOD FLEW CONSCIOUSLY TO HER CHEEKS AFTER SHE HAD SPOKEN AND SHE CAUGHT HER UNDER LIP SHARPLY BETWEEN HER TEETH AND THAT DID NOT HELP MATTERS OR MAKE HER TEMPER MORE YIELDING
7705-101579-0025 FLEERED PARK WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD FRIEND
7705-101579-0026 SHE WRINKLED HER NOSE AT HIM ALSO WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD FRIEND AND THURSTON STIRRED RESTLESSLY IN HIS CHAIR HE DID NOT LIKE EVEN PARK TO BE TOO FAMILIAR WITH MONA
7705-101579-0027 THOUGH HE KNEW THERE WAS A GIRL IN SHELLANNE WHOSE NAME PARK SOMETIMES SPOKE IN HIS SLEEP SHE LIFTED THE BIG GLASS LAMP DOWN FROM ITS PLACE ON THE CLOCK SHELF AND LIGHTED IT WITH FINGERS NOT QUITE STEADY YOU MEN
7705-101579-0028 THE ROAD FROM HERE TO THE HILL IS HALF UNDER WATER RIGHT NOW THE RIVER'S GOT OVER THE BANK ABOVE AND IS FLOODING DOWN THROUGH THE HORSE PASTURE BY THE TIME THE WATER GOT UP HERE THE RIVER'D BE AS WIDE AND DEEP ONE SIDE UH YUH AS THE OTHER
7705-101579-0029 THEN WHERE'D YUH BE AT IT WON'T GET UP HERE THOUGH MONA ASSERTED COOLLY IT NEVER HAS NO AND THE LAZY EIGHT NEVER HAD TO WORK THE YELLOWSTONE RANGE ON SPRING ROUNDUP BEFORE EITHER PARK TOLD HER MEANINGLY
7705-101579-0030 WHEREUPON MONA GOT UPON HER PEDESTAL AND SMILED HER UNPLEASANT SMILE AGAINST WHICH EVEN PARK HAD NO ARGUMENT READY THEY LINGERED TILL LONG AFTER ALL GOOD COWPUNCHERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THEIR BEDS
7705-101579-0031 AND SET BOUNDS WHICH IT COULD NOT PASS HOWEVER MUCH IT MIGHT RAGE AGAINST THEIR BASE WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK A WHEEZY NINE MONA GLANCED AT IT SIGNIFICANTLY AND SMOTHERED A YAWN MORE THAN HALF AFFECTED
7705-101579-0032 IT WAS A HINT WHICH NO MAN WITH AN ATOM OF SELF RESPECT COULD OVERLOOK WITH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING THE TWO ROSE I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO BE GOING PARK SAID WITH SOME CEREMONY
7705-101579-0033 I KEPT THINK ING MAYBE JACK WOULD SHOW UP IT AIN'T RIGHT TO LEAVE YUH HERE ALONE LIKE THIS I DON'T SEE WHY NOT I'M NOT THE LEAST BIT AFRAID MONA SAID HER TONE WAS IMPERSONAL AND HAD IN IT A NOTE OF DISMISSAL
7705-101579-0034 SO THERE BEING NOTHING ELSE THAT THEY COULD DO THEY SAID GOOD NIGHT AND TOOK THEMSELVES OFF THIS IS SURE FIERCE PARK GRUMBLED WHEN THEY STRUCK THE LOWER GROUND
7705-101579-0035 SAY THE WATER HAS COME UP A LOT DON'T YUH THINK BUD IF IT RAISES MUCH MORE MONA'LL SURE HAVE A CHANCE TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION IT'D JUST ABOUT SERVE HER RIGHT TOO
7705-101579-0036 THURSTON DID NOT THINK SO BUT HE WAS IN TOO DISPIRITED A MOOD TO ARGUE THE POINT IT HAD NOT BEEN GOOD FOR HIS PEACE OF MIND TO SIT AND WATCH THE COLOR COME AND GO IN MONA'S CHEEKS
7705-101579-0037 AND THE LAUGHTER SPRING UNHERALDED INTO HER DEAR BIG EYES AND THE LIGHT TANGLE ITSELF IN THE WAVES OF HER HAIR HE GUIDED HIS HORSE CAREFULLY THROUGH THE DEEP PLACES AND NOTED UNEASILY HOW MUCH DEEPER IT WAS
7705-101579-0038 THAN WHEN THEY HAD CROSSED BEFORE HE CURSED THE CONVENTIONS WHICH FORBADE HIS STAYING AND WATCHING OVER THE GIRL BACK THERE IN THE HOUSE WHICH ALREADY STOOD UPON AN ISLAND CUT OFF FROM THE SAFE
7705-101579-0039 HIGH LAND BY A STRIP OF BACKWATER THAT WAS WIDENING AND DEEPENING EVERY MINUTE AND WHEN IT ROSE HIGH ENOUGH TO FLOW INTO THE RIVER BELOW WOULD HAVE A CURRENT THAT WOULD MAKE A NASTY CROSSING
7705-101579-0040 ON THE FIRST RISE HE STOPPED AND LOOKED BACK AT THE LIGHT WHICH SHONE OUT FROM AMONG THE DRIPPING COTTONWOODS EVEN THEN HE WAS TEMPTED TO GO BACK AND BRAVE HER ANGER THAT HE MIGHT FEEL ASSURED OF HER SAFETY
7705-101579-0041 COME ON BUD MONA WON'T HAVE US AROUND SO THE SOONER WE GET UNDER COVER THE BETTER FOR US SHE'S GOT LOTS UH NERVE I GUESS SHE'LL MAKE OUT ALL RIGHT THERE WAS COMMON SENSE IN THE ARGUMENT AND THURSTON RECOGNIZED IT
7705-101579-0042 AND RODE ON TO CAMP BUT INSTEAD OF UNSADDLING AS HE WOULD NATURALLY HAVE DONE HE TIED SUNFISH TO THE BED WAGON AND THREW HIS SLICKER OVER HIS BACK TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE RAIN
