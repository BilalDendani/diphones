1392-135654-0000 AND ACCORDING AS THIS SUPERIORITY ENCREASES AND SURPASSES THE OPPOSITE CHANCES THE PROBABILITY RECEIVES A PROPORTIONABLE ENCREASE AND BEGETS STILL A HIGHER DEGREE OF BELIEF OR ASSENT TO THAT SIDE
1392-135654-0001 IT WOULD BE MORE PROBABLE THAT THE FORMER WOULD TURN UP THAN THE LATTER THOUGH IF IT HAD A THOUSAND SIDES MARKED IN THE SAME MANNER AND ONLY ONE SIDE DIFFERENT THE PROBABILITY WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER AND OUR BELIEF OR EXPECTATION
1392-135654-0002 OF THE EVENT MORE STEADY AND SECURE THIS PROCESS OF THE THOUGHT OR REASONING MAY SEEM TRIVIAL AND OBVIOUS BUT TO THOSE WHO CONSIDER IT MORE NARROWLY IT MAY PERHAPS AFFORD MATTER FOR CURIOUS SPECULATION
1392-135654-0003 TO RENDER ALL THE PARTICULAR EVENTS COMPREHENDED IN IT ENTIRELY EQUAL BUT FINDING A GREATER NUMBER OF SIDES CONCUR IN THE ONE EVENT THAN IN THE OTHER THE MIND IS CARRIED MORE FREQUENTLY TO THAT EVENT AND MEETS IT OFTENER
1392-135654-0004 IN REVOLVING THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES OR CHANCES ON WHICH THE ULTIMATE RESULT DEPENDS THIS CONCURRENCE OF SEVERAL VIEWS IN ONE PARTICULAR EVENT BEGETS IMMEDIATELY BY AN INEXPLICABLE CONTRIVANCE OF NATURE
1392-135654-0005 AND GIVES THAT EVENT THE ADVANTAGE OVER ITS ANTAGONIST WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY A SMALLER NUMBER OF VIEWS AND RECURS LESS FREQUENTLY TO THE MIND IF WE ALLOW THAT BELIEF IS NOTHING BUT A FIRMER
1392-135654-0006 AND STRONGER CONCEPTION OF AN OBJECT THAN WHAT ATTENDS THE MERE FICTIONS OF THE IMAGINATION THIS OPERATION MAY PERHAPS IN SOME MEASURE BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE CONCURRENCE OF THESE SEVERAL VIEWS OR GLIMPSES
1392-135654-0007 IMPRINTS THE IDEA MORE STRONGLY ON THE IMAGINATION GIVES IT SUPERIOR FORCE AND VIGOUR RENDERS ITS INFLUENCE ON THE PASSIONS AND AFFECTIONS MORE SENSIBLE AND IN A WORD BEGETS THAT RELIANCE OR SECURITY
1392-135654-0008 WHICH HAS HITHERTO ADMITTED OF NO EXCEPTION BUT THERE ARE OTHER CAUSES WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND MORE IRREGULAR AND UNCERTAIN NOR HAS RHUBARB ALWAYS PROVED A PURGE OR OPIUM
1392-135654-0009 BUT SUPPOSE THAT SOME SECRET CAUSES IN THE PARTICULAR STRUCTURE OF PARTS HAVE PREVENTED THE OPERATION OUR REASONINGS HOWEVER AND CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING THE EVENT
1392-135654-0010 ARE THE SAME AS IF THIS PRINCIPLE HAD NO PLACE BEING DETERMINED BY CUSTOM TO TRANSFER THE PAST TO THE FUTURE IN ALL OUR INFERENCES WHERE THE PAST HAS BEEN ENTIRELY REGULAR AND UNIFORM WE EXPECT THE EVENT WITH THE GREATEST ASSURANCE
1392-135654-0011 WHICH ARE TO APPEARANCE EXACTLY SIMILAR ALL THESE VARIOUS EFFECTS MUST OCCUR TO THE MIND IN TRANSFERRING THE PAST TO THE FUTURE AND ENTER INTO OUR CONSIDERATION WHEN WE DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF THE EVENT
1392-135654-0012 THOUGH WE GIVE THE PREFERENCE TO THAT WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND MOST USUAL AND BELIEVE THAT THIS EFFECT WILL EXIST WE MUST NOT OVERLOOK THE OTHER EFFECTS BUT MUST ASSIGN TO EACH OF THEM A PARTICULAR WEIGHT AND AUTHORITY IN PROPORTION
1392-135654-0013 AS WE HAVE FOUND IT TO BE MORE OR LESS FREQUENT IT IS MORE PROBABLE IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY OF EUROPE THAT THERE WILL BE FROST SOMETIME IN JANUARY THAN THAT THE WEATHER WILL CONTINUE OPEN THROUGHOUT THAT WHOLE MONTH
1392-135654-0014 THOUGH THIS PROBABILITY VARIES ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT CLIMATES AND APPROACHES TO A CERTAINTY IN THE MORE NORTHERN KINGDOMS HERE THEN IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT WHEN WE TRANSFER THE PAST TO THE FUTURE
1392-135654-0015 IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT WHICH WILL RESULT FROM ANY CAUSE WE TRANSFER ALL THE DIFFERENT EVENTS IN THE SAME PROPORTION AS THEY HAVE APPEARED IN THE PAST AND CONCEIVE ONE TO HAVE EXISTED A HUNDRED TIMES FOR INSTANCE
1392-135654-0016 ANOTHER TEN TIMES AND ANOTHER ONCE AS A GREAT NUMBER OF VIEWS DO HERE CONCUR IN ONE EVENT THEY FORTIFY AND CONFIRM IT TO THE IMAGINATION BEGET THAT SENTIMENT WHICH WE CALL BELIEF AND GIVE ITS OBJECT
1392-135654-0017 UPON ANY OF THE RECEIVED SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY AND HE WILL BE SENSIBLE OF THE DIFFICULTY FOR MY PART I SHALL THINK IT SUFFICIENT IF THE PRESENT HINTS EXCITE THE CURIOSITY OF PHILOSOPHERS
