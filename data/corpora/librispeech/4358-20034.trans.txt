4358-20034-0000 THE OLD CHURCH THERE ARE CERTAIN OLD FASHIONED PEOPLE WHO FIND FAULT WITH THE LUXURIOUSNESS OF OUR CHURCHES AND ASCRIBE TO THE WARMTH AND COMFORT
4358-20034-0001 WHICH CONTRAST SO STRONGLY WITH THE HARDSHIPS OF EARLY TIMES THE ACKNOWLEDGED SLEEPINESS OF MODERN CONGREGATIONS FOR MY PART I SEE NO NECESSARY CONNECTION BETWEEN DISCOMFORT AND DEVOTION
4358-20034-0002 MY SOUL AT LEAST SYMPATHIZES SO MUCH WITH ITS PHYSICAL ADJUNCT THAT WHEN THE LATTER IS UNCOMFORTABLE THE FORMER IS NEVER QUITE FREE AND ACTIVE LET ME CALL TO REMEMBRANCE THE CHURCH MY CHILDHOOD KNEW
4358-20034-0003 WITH ITS CAPACIOUS SQUARE PEWS IN WHICH HALF THE AUDIENCE TURNED THEIR BACKS UPON THE MINISTER THE SEATS MADE TO RISE AND FALL FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF STANDING
4358-20034-0004 SOME WITH BLACK SILK CAPS TO PROTECT THEIR BALD HEADS FROM THE FREEZING DRAUGHTS OF AIR FROM THE PORCHLESS DOORS THE OLD WOMEN'S SEATS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
4358-20034-0005 AND THE ENVIED POSITION OF CERTAIN LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAD AN EXTENSIVE PROSPECT THROUGH THE OPEN PEW TOP WITHIN DOORS AND A VIEW OF THE HAY SCALES AND THE TOWN PUMP THROUGH THE WINDOW BESIDES
4358-20034-0006 THOSE WINDOWS IN A DOUBLE ROW WITH THE GALLERY BETWEEN HOW REGULARLY I COUNTED THE SMALL PANES ALWAYS FORGETTING THE NUMBER TO MAKE THE SAME WEARY TASK NECESSARY EVERY SUNDAY THE SINGING SEATS
4358-20034-0007 PROJECTING FROM THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE GALLERY FURNISHED ME WITH ANOTHER HEBDOMADAL STUDY IN LARGE GILT LETTERS OF ANTIQUE AWKWARDNESS WHICH SO IMPRESSED THEMSELVES ON MY MIND THAT I SEE THEM NOW
4358-20034-0008 VERY EARNESTLY I USED TO GAZE AT THE SLENDER POINT BY WHICH IT HUNG SUSPENDED AND WISHED IF IT MUST COME DOWN THAT I MIGHT MAKE THE GILT ORNAMENT AT THE APEX RESEMBLING A VASE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN MY PRIZE
4358-20034-0009 THE TERRORS OF THAT DARK MYSTERIOUS CELL HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON MY CONDUCT HOWEVER AS I WAS NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANY SUCH LYNX EYED FUNCTIONARY
4358-20034-0010 BUT IN WINTER THE VAST AIRY SPACE HAD A PECULIAR AND SEARCHING CHILL NO BARN COULD BE COLDER EXCEPT THAT THE NUMEROUS FOOTSTOVES MADE SOME LITTLE CHANGE IN THE AIR DURING SERVICE
4358-20034-0011 AND THE IRREVERENT WAY IN WHICH HE MADE HIS DESCENT IN VIEW OF THE ASSEMBLY AFTER DEPOSITING HIS BURDEN WAS THUS REBUKED BY AN OLD LADY WHO WAS ALWAYS DROLL AND QUAINT WHY MATTHEW
4358-20034-0012 WHEN YOU COME DOWN THE PULPIT STAIRS OF A SUNDAY YOU THROW UP YOUR HEELS LIKE A HORSE COMING OUT OF A STABLE DOOR OLDER GREW THE CHURCH AND COLDER
4358-20034-0013 AND IF PEOPLE THEN STAID AT HOME ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS THEY HAD A BETTER EXCUSE FOR DOING SO THAN THEIR SUCCESSORS CAN MUSTER THE CHORISTER EVEN WAS
4358-20034-0014 EFFORTS WERE MADE TO PREVAIL UPON THE ELDERLY PART OF THE PARISH TO PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF STOVES WITH LONG FUNNELS THEY SCORNED THE ENERVATING LUXURY THEIR FATHERS HAD WORSHIPPED IN THE COLD
4358-20034-0015 AND THEIR SONS MIGHT BUT AH HOW DEGENERATE WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF THE NOBLE OLD PURITAN CHURCH GOERS
4358-20034-0016 THE SERVICES CURTAILED TO HALF THEIR PROPER LENGTH YET FINDING THE PATIENCE OF THE LISTENERS ALL TOO SHORT THE DEGENERATE DESCENDANTS CARRIED THE DAY HOWEVER
4358-20034-0017 THE MOST BIGOTED OF THEIR OPPOSERS BECOMING DISABLED BY RHEUMATISM THE OLD SEXTON RESIGNATION TO INEVITABLE EVILS BEING A LESSON HE HAD HAD MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN SUBMITTED WITH A GOOD GRACE
4358-20034-0018 THE STOVES WERE PROVIDED AND AN UNCOMMONLY FULL ATTENDANCE THE NEXT SABBATH SHOWED THE VERY GENERAL INTEREST THE MATTER HAD EXCITED HOW WOULD IT SEEM WOULD ANY ONE FAINT
4358-20034-0019 THERE WAS BY NO MEANS A SUPERABUNDANCE OF HEAT
4358-20034-0020 NO ONE COULD SEE ACROSS THE CHURCH AND THE MINISTER LOOMED UP AS IF IN A DENSE FOG ALL EYES WERE FOUNTAINS OF TEARS
4358-20034-0021 AT LAST THE OLD SEXTON WENT WITH A SLOW AND SUBDUED STEP UP TO THE PULPIT AND WIPING HIS EYES RESPECTFULLY INQUIRED IN A WHISPER WHETHER THERE WAS NOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH SMOKE
4358-20034-0022 THIS SUGGESTION BEING VERY SMILINGLY ASSENTED TO HE PROCEEDED TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRES AND FOR THAT DAY THE SERVICES WERE NOT INDEBTED TO ARTIFICIAL WARMTH TO PROMOTE THEIR EFFECT
4358-20034-0023 HOW SAD ARE IMPROVEMENTS IN PLACES TO WHICH OUR CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS CLING
4358-20034-0024 HOW WAS MY HEART GRIEVED WHEN THE OLD FASHIONED MEETING HOUSE WAS CONVERTED INTO THE MODERN TEMPLE TIME AND DECAY HAD RENDERED THE TALL SPIRE UNSAFE
4358-20034-0025 YET ITS FALL BY FORCE AND PREMEDITATED PURPOSE SEEMED A SACRILEGE I FELT AFFRONTED FOR THE HUGE WEATHERCOCK RECLINING SULKILY AGAINST A FENCE NO MORE TO POINT HIS BEAK TO THE EAST WITH OBSTINATE PREFERENCE
4358-20034-0026 I MOURNED OVER THE BROAD OLD FASHIONED DIAL ON WHICH YOUNG EYES COULD DISCERN THE TIME A MILE OFF THE OLD SEXTON LIVED TO SEE THIS CHANGE
4358-20034-0027 THE BELOVED MINISTER AND MANY MANY WHO SAT WITH TRUSTFUL AND DEVOTED HEARTS UNDER HIS TEACHINGS ARE GONE TO THEIR REWARD A BOARD FROM THE OLD PULPIT
