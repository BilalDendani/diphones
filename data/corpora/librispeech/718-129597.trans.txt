718-129597-0000 IN THIS WAY I BECAME ONE AMONG THE BEAST PEOPLE IN THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU WHEN I AWOKE IT WAS DARK ABOUT ME MY ARM ACHED IN ITS BANDAGES I SAT UP WONDERING AT FIRST WHERE I MIGHT BE I HEARD COARSE VOICES TALKING OUTSIDE
718-129597-0001 I HEARD SOMETHING BREATHING SAW SOMETHING CROUCHED TOGETHER CLOSE BESIDE ME I HELD MY BREATH TRYING TO SEE WHAT IT WAS IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY INTERMINABLY THEN SOMETHING SOFT AND WARM AND MOIST PASSED ACROSS MY HAND ALL MY MUSCLES CONTRACTED
718-129597-0002 I SNATCHED MY HAND AWAY A CRY OF ALARM BEGAN AND WAS STIFLED IN MY THROAT
718-129597-0003 I MASTER WHO ARE YOU THEY SAY THERE IS NO MASTER NOW BUT I KNOW I KNOW
718-129597-0004 I AM YOUR SLAVE MASTER ARE YOU THE ONE I MET ON THE BEACH I ASKED THE SAME MASTER THE THING WAS EVIDENTLY FAITHFUL ENOUGH FOR IT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN UPON ME AS I SLEPT
718-129597-0005 IT IS WELL I SAID EXTENDING MY HAND FOR ANOTHER LICKING KISS I BEGAN TO REALISE WHAT ITS PRESENCE MEANT AND THE TIDE OF MY COURAGE FLOWED WHERE ARE THE OTHERS I ASKED THEY ARE MAD THEY ARE FOOLS SAID THE DOG MAN
718-129597-0006 EVEN NOW THEY TALK TOGETHER BEYOND THERE THEY SAY THE MASTER IS DEAD THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP IS DEAD THAT OTHER WHO WALKED IN THE SEA IS AS WE ARE WE HAVE NO MASTER NO WHIPS NO HOUSE OF PAIN ANY MORE THERE IS AN END
718-129597-0007 WE LOVE THE LAW AND WILL KEEP IT BUT THERE IS NO PAIN NO MASTER NO WHIPS FOR EVER AGAIN SO THEY SAY BUT I KNOW MASTER I KNOW I FELT IN THE DARKNESS AND PATTED THE DOG MAN'S HEAD IT IS WELL I SAID AGAIN
718-129597-0008 PRESENTLY YOU WILL SLAY THEM ALL SAID THE DOG MAN PRESENTLY I ANSWERED I WILL SLAY THEM ALL AFTER CERTAIN DAYS AND CERTAIN THINGS HAVE COME TO PASS EVERY ONE OF THEM SAVE THOSE YOU SPARE EVERY ONE OF THEM SHALL BE SLAIN
718-129597-0009 WHAT THE MASTER WISHES TO KILL THE MASTER KILLS SAID THE DOG MAN WITH A CERTAIN SATISFACTION IN HIS VOICE AND THAT THEIR SINS MAY GROW I SAID LET THEM LIVE IN THEIR FOLLY UNTIL THEIR TIME IS RIPE LET THEM NOT KNOW THAT I AM THE MASTER
718-129597-0010 THE MASTER'S WILL IS SWEET SAID THE DOG MAN WITH THE READY TACT OF HIS CANINE BLOOD BUT ONE HAS SINNED SAID I HIM I WILL KILL WHENEVER I MAY MEET HIM WHEN I SAY TO YOU THAT IS HE SEE THAT YOU FALL UPON HIM
718-129597-0011 FOR A MOMENT THE OPENING OF THE HUT WAS BLACKENED BY THE EXIT OF THE DOG MAN THEN I FOLLOWED AND STOOD UP ALMOST IN THE EXACT SPOT WHERE I HAD BEEN WHEN I HAD HEARD MOREAU AND HIS STAGHOUND PURSUING ME
718-129597-0012 TAKING LITTLE HEED OF THE DIM THINGS THAT PEERED AT US OUT OF THE HUTS NONE ABOUT THE FIRE ATTEMPTED TO SALUTE ME MOST OF THEM DISREGARDED ME OSTENTATIOUSLY I LOOKED ROUND FOR THE HYENA SWINE BUT HE WAS NOT THERE
718-129597-0013 ALTOGETHER PERHAPS TWENTY OF THE BEAST FOLK SQUATTED STARING INTO THE FIRE OR TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER HE IS DEAD HE IS DEAD THE MASTER IS DEAD SAID THE VOICE OF THE APE MAN TO THE RIGHT OF ME
718-129597-0014 HE IS NOT DEAD SAID I IN A LOUD VOICE EVEN NOW HE WATCHES US THIS STARTLED THEM TWENTY PAIRS OF EYES REGARDED ME THE HOUSE OF PAIN IS GONE SAID I IT WILL COME AGAIN
718-129597-0015 THE MASTER YOU CANNOT SEE YET EVEN NOW HE LISTENS AMONG YOU TRUE TRUE SAID THE DOG MAN THEY WERE STAGGERED AT MY ASSURANCE AN ANIMAL MAY BE FEROCIOUS AND CUNNING ENOUGH BUT IT TAKES A REAL MAN TO TELL A LIE
718-129597-0016 THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGED ARM SPEAKS A STRANGE THING SAID ONE OF THE BEAST FOLK I TELL YOU IT IS SO I SAID THE MASTER AND THE HOUSE OF PAIN WILL COME AGAIN WOE BE TO HIM WHO BREAKS THE LAW THEY LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT ONE ANOTHER
718-129597-0017 THEY LOOKED I NOTICED AT THE DEEP CUTS I MADE IN THE TURF THEN THE SATYR RAISED A DOUBT I ANSWERED HIM THEN ONE OF THE DAPPLED THINGS OBJECTED AND AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION SPRANG UP ROUND THE FIRE EVERY MOMENT I BEGAN TO FEEL MORE CONVINCED OF MY PRESENT SECURITY
718-129597-0018 I TALKED NOW WITHOUT THE CATCHING IN MY BREATH DUE TO THE INTENSITY OF MY EXCITEMENT THAT HAD TROUBLED ME AT FIRST IN THE COURSE OF ABOUT AN HOUR I HAD REALLY CONVINCED SEVERAL OF THE BEAST FOLK OF THE TRUTH OF MY ASSERTIONS AND TALKED MOST OF THE OTHERS INTO A DUBIOUS STATE
718-129597-0019 I KEPT A SHARP EYE FOR MY ENEMY THE HYENA SWINE BUT HE NEVER APPEARED EVERY NOW AND THEN A SUSPICIOUS MOVEMENT WOULD STARTLE ME BUT MY CONFIDENCE GREW RAPIDLY THEN AS THE MOON CREPT DOWN FROM THE ZENITH ONE BY ONE THE LISTENERS BEGAN TO YAWN
718-129597-0020 AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER RETIRED TOWARDS THE DENS IN THE RAVINE AND I DREADING THE SILENCE AND DARKNESS WENT WITH THEM KNOWING I WAS SAFER WITH SEVERAL OF THEM THAN WITH ONE ALONE IN THIS MANNER BEGAN THE LONGER PART OF MY SOJOURN UPON THIS ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU
718-129597-0021 BUT FROM THAT NIGHT UNTIL THE END CAME THERE WAS BUT ONE THING HAPPENED TO TELL SAVE A SERIES OF INNUMERABLE SMALL UNPLEASANT DETAILS AND THE FRETTING OF AN INCESSANT UNEASINESS
718-129597-0022 SO THAT I PREFER TO MAKE NO CHRONICLE FOR THAT GAP OF TIME TO TELL ONLY ONE CARDINAL INCIDENT OF THE TEN MONTHS I SPENT AS AN INTIMATE OF THESE HALF HUMANISED BRUTES THERE IS MUCH THAT STICKS IN MY MEMORY THAT I COULD WRITE THINGS THAT I WOULD CHEERFULLY GIVE MY RIGHT HAND TO FORGET
718-129597-0023 BUT THEY DO NOT HELP THE TELLING OF THE STORY
718-129597-0024 I FOUND THEIR SIMPLE SCALE OF HONOUR WAS BASED MAINLY ON THE CAPACITY FOR INFLICTING TRENCHANT WOUNDS INDEED I MAY SAY WITHOUT VANITY I HOPE THAT I HELD SOMETHING LIKE PRE EMINENCE AMONG THEM ONE OR TWO WHOM IN A RARE ACCESS OF HIGH SPIRITS I HAD SCARRED RATHER BADLY
718-129597-0025 BORE ME A GRUDGE BUT IT VENTED ITSELF CHIEFLY BEHIND MY BACK AND AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM MY MISSILES IN GRIMACES THE HYENA SWINE AVOIDED ME AND I WAS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT FOR HIM MY INSEPARABLE DOG MAN HATED AND DREADED HIM INTENSELY
718-129597-0026 I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE BRUTE'S ATTACHMENT TO ME IT WAS SOON EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE FORMER MONSTER HAD TASTED BLOOD AND GONE THE WAY OF THE LEOPARD MAN
718-129597-0027 ONCE I TRIED TO INDUCE THE BEAST FOLK TO HUNT HIM BUT I LACKED THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THEM CO OPERATE FOR ONE END AGAIN AND AGAIN I TRIED TO APPROACH HIS DEN AND COME UPON HIM UNAWARE BUT ALWAYS HE WAS TOO ACUTE FOR ME AND SAW OR WINDED ME AND GOT AWAY HE TOO
718-129597-0028 MADE EVERY FOREST PATHWAY DANGEROUS TO ME AND MY ALLY WITH HIS LURKING AMBUSCADES
718-129597-0029 IN THE FIRST MONTH OR SO THE BEAST FOLK COMPARED WITH THEIR LATTER CONDITION WERE HUMAN ENOUGH AND FOR ONE OR TWO BESIDES MY CANINE FRIEND I EVEN CONCEIVED A FRIENDLY TOLERANCE THE LITTLE PINK SLOTH CREATURE DISPLAYED AN ODD AFFECTION FOR ME AND TOOK TO FOLLOWING ME ABOUT
718-129597-0030 THE MONKEY MAN BORED ME HOWEVER HE ASSUMED ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS FIVE DIGITS THAT HE WAS MY EQUAL AND WAS FOR EVER JABBERING AT ME JABBERING THE MOST ARRANT NONSENSE
718-129597-0031 HE HAD AN IDEA I BELIEVE THAT TO GABBLE ABOUT NAMES THAT MEANT NOTHING WAS THE PROPER USE OF SPEECH HE CALLED IT BIG THINKS TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM LITTLE THINKS THE SANE EVERY DAY INTERESTS OF LIFE IF EVER I MADE A REMARK HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE WOULD PRAISE IT VERY MUCH
718-129597-0032 ASK ME TO SAY IT AGAIN LEARN IT BY HEART AND GO OFF REPEATING IT WITH A WORD WRONG HERE OR THERE TO ALL THE MILDER OF THE BEAST PEOPLE HE THOUGHT NOTHING OF WHAT WAS PLAIN AND COMPREHENSIBLE I INVENTED SOME VERY CURIOUS BIG THINKS FOR HIS ESPECIAL USE
718-129597-0033 I THINK NOW THAT HE WAS THE SILLIEST CREATURE I EVER MET HE HAD DEVELOPED IN THE MOST WONDERFUL WAY THE DISTINCTIVE SILLINESS OF MAN WITHOUT LOSING ONE JOT OF THE NATURAL FOLLY OF A MONKEY
718-129597-0034 DURING THAT TIME THEY RESPECTED THE USAGE ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW AND BEHAVED WITH GENERAL DECORUM ONCE I FOUND ANOTHER RABBIT TORN TO PIECES BY THE HYENA SWINE I AM ASSURED BUT THAT WAS ALL
718-129597-0035 IT WAS ABOUT MAY WHEN I FIRST DISTINCTLY PERCEIVED A GROWING DIFFERENCE IN THEIR SPEECH AND CARRIAGE A GROWING COARSENESS OF ARTICULATION A GROWING DISINCLINATION TO TALK
718-129597-0036 THOUGH THEY EVIDENTLY FELT ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES EVERY NOW AND THEN I WOULD COME UPON ONE OR ANOTHER RUNNING ON TOES AND FINGER TIPS AND QUITE UNABLE TO RECOVER THE VERTICAL ATTITUDE THEY HELD THINGS MORE CLUMSILY DRINKING BY SUCTION FEEDING BY GNAWING GREW COMMONER EVERY DAY
718-129597-0037 I REALISED MORE KEENLY THAN EVER WHAT MOREAU HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE STUBBORN BEAST FLESH THEY WERE REVERTING AND REVERTING VERY RAPIDLY SOME OF THEM THE PIONEERS IN THIS I NOTICED WITH SOME SURPRISE WERE ALL FEMALES
718-129597-0038 THE TRADITION OF THE LAW WAS CLEARLY LOSING ITS FORCE I CANNOT PURSUE THIS DISAGREEABLE SUBJECT MY DOG MAN IMPERCEPTIBLY SLIPPED BACK TO THE DOG AGAIN DAY BY DAY HE BECAME DUMB QUADRUPEDAL HAIRY
718-129597-0039 I SCARCELY NOTICED THE TRANSITION FROM THE COMPANION ON MY RIGHT HAND TO THE LURCHING DOG AT MY SIDE AS THE CARELESSNESS AND DISORGANISATION INCREASED FROM DAY TO DAY THE LANE OF DWELLING PLACES AT NO TIME VERY SWEET BECAME SO LOATHSOME THAT I LEFT IT
718-129597-0040 HOW THE HAIR BEGAN TO SPREAD OVER THE EXPOSED LIMBS HOW THEIR FOREHEADS FELL AWAY AND THEIR FACES PROJECTED HOW THE QUASI HUMAN INTIMACY I HAD PERMITTED MYSELF WITH SOME OF THEM IN THE FIRST MONTH OF MY LONELINESS BECAME A SHUDDERING HORROR TO RECALL THE CHANGE WAS SLOW AND INEVITABLE
718-129597-0041 FOR THEM AND FOR ME IT CAME WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE SHOCK I STILL WENT AMONG THEM IN SAFETY BECAUSE NO JOLT IN THE DOWNWARD GLIDE HAD RELEASED THE INCREASING CHARGE OF EXPLOSIVE ANIMALISM THAT OUSTED THE HUMAN DAY BY DAY BUT I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SOON NOW THAT SHOCK MUST COME
718-129597-0042 WE WERE IN JUST THE STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM THAT WOULD REMAIN IN ONE OF THOSE HAPPY FAMILY CAGES WHICH ANIMAL TAMERS EXHIBIT IF THE TAMER WERE TO LEAVE IT FOR EVER OF COURSE THESE CREATURES DID NOT DECLINE INTO SUCH BEASTS AS THE READER HAS SEEN IN ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
718-129597-0043 AND THE DWINDLING SHREDS OF THE HUMANITY STILL STARTLED ME EVERY NOW AND THEN A MOMENTARY RECRUDESCENCE OF SPEECH PERHAPS AN UNEXPECTED DEXTERITY OF THE FORE FEET A PITIFUL ATTEMPT TO WALK ERECT I TOO MUST HAVE UNDERGONE STRANGE CHANGES
718-129597-0044 AT FIRST I SPENT THE DAYLIGHT HOURS ON THE SOUTHWARD BEACH WATCHING FOR A SHIP HOPING AND PRAYING FOR A SHIP I COUNTED ON THE IPECACUANHA RETURNING AS THE YEAR WORE ON BUT SHE NEVER CAME FIVE TIMES I SAW SAILS AND THRICE SMOKE BUT NOTHING EVER TOUCHED THE ISLAND
718-129597-0045 I ALWAYS HAD A BONFIRE READY BUT NO DOUBT THE VOLCANIC REPUTATION OF THE ISLAND WAS TAKEN TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER THAT I BEGAN TO THINK OF MAKING A RAFT BY THAT TIME MY ARM HAD HEALED AND BOTH MY HANDS WERE AT MY SERVICE AGAIN
718-129597-0046 NONE OF THE ABUNDANT CREEPERS SEEMED LIMBER OR STRONG ENOUGH AND WITH ALL MY LITTER OF SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION I COULD NOT DEVISE ANY WAY OF MAKING THEM SO
718-129597-0047 I SPENT MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT GRUBBING AMONG THE BLACK RUINS OF THE ENCLOSURE AND ON THE BEACH WHERE THE BOATS HAD BEEN BURNT LOOKING FOR NAILS AND OTHER STRAY PIECES OF METAL THAT MIGHT PROVE OF SERVICE
718-129597-0048 NOW AND THEN SOME BEAST CREATURE WOULD WATCH ME AND GO LEAPING OFF WHEN I CALLED TO IT THERE CAME A SEASON OF THUNDER STORMS AND HEAVY RAIN WHICH GREATLY RETARDED MY WORK BUT AT LAST THE RAFT WAS COMPLETED I WAS DELIGHTED WITH IT
718-129597-0049 BUT WITH A CERTAIN LACK OF PRACTICAL SENSE WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY BANE I HAD MADE IT A MILE OR MORE FROM THE SEA AND BEFORE I HAD DRAGGED IT DOWN TO THE BEACH THE THING HAD FALLEN TO PIECES PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL THAT I WAS SAVED FROM LAUNCHING IT
718-129597-0050 HE HAD LONG SINCE LOST SPEECH AND ACTIVE MOVEMENT AND THE LANK HAIR OF THE LITTLE BRUTE GREW THICKER EVERY DAY AND HIS STUMPY CLAWS MORE ASKEW
718-129597-0051 AT FIRST I DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT PRESENTLY IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT HE WISHED ME TO FOLLOW HIM AND THIS I DID AT LAST SLOWLY FOR THE DAY WAS HOT WHEN WE REACHED THE TREES HE CLAMBERED INTO THEM FOR HE COULD TRAVEL BETTER AMONG THEIR SWINGING CREEPERS THAN ON THE GROUND
718-129597-0052 AND SUDDENLY IN A TRAMPLED SPACE I CAME UPON A GHASTLY GROUP MY SAINT BERNARD CREATURE LAY ON THE GROUND DEAD AND NEAR HIS BODY CROUCHED THE HYENA SWINE GRIPPING THE QUIVERING FLESH WITH ITS MISSHAPEN CLAWS GNAWING AT IT AND SNARLING WITH DELIGHT
718-129597-0053 AS I APPROACHED THE MONSTER LIFTED ITS GLARING EYES TO MINE ITS LIPS WENT TREMBLING BACK FROM ITS RED STAINED TEETH AND IT GROWLED MENACINGLY IT WAS NOT AFRAID AND NOT ASHAMED THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE HUMAN TAINT HAD VANISHED
718-129597-0054 I ADVANCED A STEP FARTHER STOPPED AND PULLED OUT MY REVOLVER AT LAST I HAD HIM FACE TO FACE THE BRUTE MADE NO SIGN OF RETREAT BUT ITS EARS WENT BACK ITS HAIR BRISTLED AND ITS BODY CROUCHED TOGETHER I AIMED BETWEEN THE EYES AND FIRED
718-129597-0055 ITS SPRING CARRIED IT OVER ME I FELL UNDER THE HIND PART OF ITS BODY BUT LUCKILY I HAD HIT AS I MEANT AND IT HAD DIED EVEN AS IT LEAPT
718-129597-0056 THAT DANGER AT LEAST WAS OVER BUT THIS I KNEW WAS ONLY THE FIRST OF THE SERIES OF RELAPSES THAT MUST COME I BURNT BOTH OF THE BODIES ON A PYRE OF BRUSHWOOD BUT AFTER THAT I SAW THAT UNLESS I LEFT THE ISLAND MY DEATH WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME
718-129597-0057 THE BEAST PEOPLE BY THAT TIME HAD WITH ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS LEFT THE RAVINE AND MADE THEMSELVES LAIRS ACCORDING TO THEIR TASTE AMONG THE THICKETS OF THE ISLAND FEW PROWLED BY DAY MOST OF THEM SLEPT AND THE ISLAND MIGHT HAVE SEEMED DESERTED TO A NEW COMER
718-129597-0058 BUT AT NIGHT THE AIR WAS HIDEOUS WITH THEIR CALLS AND HOWLING I HAD HALF A MIND TO MAKE A MASSACRE OF THEM TO BUILD TRAPS OR FIGHT THEM WITH MY KNIFE HAD I POSSESSED SUFFICIENT CARTRIDGES I SHOULD NOT HAVE HESITATED TO BEGIN THE KILLING
718-129597-0059 THERE COULD NOW BE SCARCELY A SCORE LEFT OF THE DANGEROUS CARNIVORES THE BRAVER OF THESE WERE ALREADY DEAD AFTER THE DEATH OF THIS POOR DOG OF MINE MY LAST FRIEND I TOO ADOPTED TO SOME EXTENT THE PRACTICE OF SLUMBERING IN THE DAYTIME IN ORDER TO BE ON MY GUARD AT NIGHT
718-129597-0060 I TURNED ONCE MORE ALMOST PASSIONATELY NOW TO HAMMERING TOGETHER STAKES AND BRANCHES TO FORM A RAFT FOR MY ESCAPE I FOUND A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES I AM AN EXTREMELY UNHANDY MAN
718-129597-0061 AND THIS TIME I TOOK CARE OF THE STRENGTH THE ONLY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE WAS THAT I HAD NO VESSEL TO CONTAIN THE WATER I SHOULD NEED IF I FLOATED FORTH UPON THESE UNTRAVELLED SEAS I WOULD HAVE EVEN TRIED POTTERY BUT THE ISLAND CONTAINED NO CLAY
718-129597-0062 I USED TO GO MOPING ABOUT THE ISLAND TRYING WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO SOLVE THIS ONE LAST DIFFICULTY SOMETIMES I WOULD GIVE WAY TO WILD OUTBURSTS OF RAGE AND HACK AND SPLINTER SOME UNLUCKY TREE IN MY INTOLERABLE VEXATION BUT I COULD THINK OF NOTHING
718-129597-0063 AND THEN CAME A DAY A WONDERFUL DAY WHICH I SPENT IN ECSTASY I SAW A SAIL TO THE SOUTHWEST A SMALL SAIL LIKE THAT OF A LITTLE SCHOONER AND FORTHWITH
718-129597-0064 IN THE DAWN THE SAIL WAS NEARER AND I SAW IT WAS THE DIRTY LUG SAIL OF A SMALL BOAT BUT IT SAILED STRANGELY MY EYES WERE WEARY WITH WATCHING AND I PEERED AND COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM TWO MEN WERE IN THE BOAT SITTING LOW DOWN ONE BY THE BOWS THE OTHER AT THE RUDDER
718-129597-0065 SUDDENLY A GREAT WHITE BIRD FLEW UP OUT OF THE BOAT AND NEITHER OF THE MEN STIRRED NOR NOTICED IT IT CIRCLED ROUND AND THEN CAME SWEEPING OVERHEAD WITH ITS STRONG WINGS OUTSPREAD THEN I STOPPED SHOUTING AND SAT DOWN ON THE HEADLAND AND RESTED MY CHIN ON MY HANDS AND STARED
718-129597-0066 SLOWLY SLOWLY THE BOAT DROVE PAST TOWARDS THE WEST
718-129597-0067 IN THE AFTERNOON THE TIDE STRANDED THE BOAT AND LEFT IT A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO TO THE WESTWARD OF THE RUINS OF THE ENCLOSURE THE MEN IN IT WERE DEAD HAD BEEN DEAD SO LONG THAT THEY FELL TO PIECES WHEN I TILTED THE BOAT ON ITS SIDE AND DRAGGED THEM OUT
718-129597-0068 ONE HAD A SHOCK OF RED HAIR LIKE THE CAPTAIN OF THE IPECACUANHA AND A DIRTY WHITE CAP LAY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AS I STOOD BESIDE THE BOAT THREE OF THE BEASTS CAME SLINKING OUT OF THE BUSHES AND SNIFFING TOWARDS ME
718-129597-0069 ONE OF MY SPASMS OF DISGUST CAME UPON ME I THRUST THE LITTLE BOAT DOWN THE BEACH AND CLAMBERED ON BOARD HER
718-129597-0070 I TURNED MY BACK UPON THEM STRUCK THE LUG AND BEGAN PADDLING OUT TO SEA I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO LOOK BEHIND ME
