7011-66622-0000 TWICE THAT NIGHT ROD WAS AWAKENED BY MUKOKI OPENING THE CABIN DOOR THE SECOND TIME HE RAISED HIMSELF UPON HIS ELBOWS AND QUIETLY WATCHED THE OLD WARRIOR IT WAS A BRILLIANTLY CLEAR NIGHT AND A FLOOD OF MOONLIGHT WAS POURING INTO THE CAMP
7011-66622-0001 HE COULD HEAR MUKOKI CHUCKLING AND GRUNTING AS THOUGH COMMUNICATING WITH HIMSELF AND AT LAST HIS CURIOSITY GETTING THE BETTER OF HIM
7011-66622-0002 MUKOKI WAS PEERING UP INTO SPACE ROD FOLLOWED HIS GAZE THE MOON WAS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE CABIN THE SKY WAS CLEAR OF CLOUDS AND SO BRIGHT WAS THE LIGHT THAT OBJECTS ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE BESIDES IT WAS BITTER COLD
7011-66622-0003 SO COLD THAT HIS FACE BEGAN TO TINGLE AS HE STOOD THERE THESE THINGS HE NOTICED BUT HE COULD SEE NOTHING TO HOLD MUKOKI'S VISION IN THE SKY ABOVE UNLESS IT WAS THE GLORIOUS BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT WHAT IS IT MUKOKI HE ASKED THE OLD INDIAN LOOKED SILENTLY AT HIM FOR A MOMENT
7011-66622-0004 SOME MYSTERIOUS ALL ABSORBING JOY REVEALED IN EVERY LINEAMENT OF HIS FACE WOLF NIGHT HE WHISPERED HE LOOKED BACK TO WHERE WABI WAS SLEEPING WOLF NIGHT HE REPEATED AND SLIPPED LIKE A SHADOW TO THE SIDE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS YOUNG HUNTER
7011-66622-0005 ROD REGARDED HIS ACTIONS WITH GROWING WONDER HE SAW HIM BEND OVER WABI SHAKE HIM BY THE SHOULDERS AND HEARD HIM REPEAT AGAIN WOLF NIGHT WOLF NIGHT WABI AWOKE AND SAT UP IN HIS BLANKETS AND MUKOKI CAME BACK TO THE DOOR
7011-66622-0006 HE HAD DRESSED HIMSELF BEFORE THIS AND NOW WITH HIS RIFLE SLIPPED OUT INTO THE NIGHT THE YOUNG INDIAN HAD JOINED ROD AT THE OPEN DOOR AND TOGETHER THEY WATCHED MUKOKI'S GAUNT FIGURE AS IT SPED SWIFTLY ACROSS THE LAKE
7011-66622-0007 UP THE HILL AND OVER INTO THE WILDERNESS DESOLATION BEYOND WHEN ROD LOOKED AT WABI HE SAW THAT THE INDIAN BOY'S EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING WITH AN EXPRESSION IN THEM THAT WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN FRIGHT AND HORROR
7011-66622-0008 WITHOUT SPEAKING HE WENT TO THE TABLE AND LIGHTED THE CANDLES AND THEN DRESSED WHEN HE WAS DONE HIS FACE STILL BORE TRACES OF SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT HE RAN BACK TO THE DOOR AND WHISTLED LOUDLY FROM HIS SHELTER BESIDE THE CABIN THE CAPTIVE WOLF RESPONDED WITH A SNARLING WHINE
7011-66622-0009 AGAIN HE WHISTLED A DOZEN TIMES TWENTY BUT THERE CAME NO REPLY MORE SWIFTLY THAN MUKOKI THE INDIAN YOUTH SPED ACROSS THE LAKE AND TO THE SUMMIT OF THE HILL MUKOKI HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED IN THE WHITE BRILLIANT VASTNESS OF THE WILDERNESS THAT STRETCHED AWAY AT HIS FEET
7011-66622-0010 WHEN WABI RETURNED TO THE CABIN ROD HAD A FIRE ROARING IN THE STOVE HE SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE IT HOLDING OUT A PAIR OF HANDS BLUE WITH COLD UGH IT'S AN AWFUL NIGHT HE SHIVERED HE LAUGHED ACROSS AT ROD A LITTLE UNEASILY
7011-66622-0011 BUT WITH THE OLD LIGHT BACK IN HIS EYES SUDDENLY HE ASKED DID MINNETAKI EVER TELL YOU ANYTHING QUEER ABOUT MUKOKI ROD NOTHING MORE THAN YOU HAVE TOLD ME YOURSELF WELL
7011-66622-0012 ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE MUKOKI HAS NOT EXACTLY A FIT BUT A LITTLE MAD SPELL I HAVE NEVER DETERMINED TO MY OWN SATISFACTION WHETHER HE IS REALLY OUT OF HIS HEAD OR NOT SOMETIMES I THINK HE IS AND SOMETIMES I THINK HE IS NOT
7011-66622-0013 BUT THE INDIANS AT THE POST BELIEVE THAT AT CERTAIN TIMES HE GOES CRAZY OVER WOLVES WOLVES EXCLAIMED ROD YES WOLVES AND HE HAS GOOD REASON A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO JUST ABOUT WHEN YOU AND I WERE BORN MUKOKI HAD A WIFE AND CHILD
7011-66622-0014 HE WOULDN'T HUNT LIKE OTHER INDIANS BUT WOULD SPEND WHOLE DAYS AT HIS SHACK PLAYING WITH IT AND TEACHING IT TO DO THINGS AND WHEN HE DID GO HUNTING HE WOULD OFTEN TOTE IT ON HIS BACK EVEN WHEN IT WASN'T MUCH MORE THAN A SQUALLING PAPOOSE HE WAS THE HAPPIEST INDIAN AT THE POST AND ONE OF THE POOREST
7011-66622-0015 ONE DAY MUKOKI CAME TO THE POST WITH A LITTLE BUNDLE OF FUR AND MOST OF THE THINGS HE GOT IN EXCHANGE FOR IT MOTHER SAYS WERE FOR THE KID HE REACHED THE STORE AT NIGHT AND EXPECTED TO LEAVE FOR HOME THE NEXT NOON WHICH WOULD BRING HIM TO HIS CAMP BEFORE DARK
7011-66622-0016 BUT SOMETHING DELAYED HIM AND HE DIDN'T GET STARTED UNTIL THE MORNING AFTER MEANWHILE LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE DAY WHEN HE WAS TO HAVE BEEN HOME HIS WIFE BUNDLED UP THE KID AND THEY SET OUT TO MEET HIM WELL A WEIRD HOWL FROM THE CAPTIVE WOLF INTERRUPTED WABI FOR A MOMENT
7011-66622-0017 WELL THEY WENT ON AND ON AND OF COURSE DID NOT MEET HIM AND THEN THE PEOPLE AT THE POST SAY THE MOTHER MUST HAVE SLIPPED AND HURT HERSELF ANYWAY WHEN MUKOKI CAME OVER THE TRAIL THE NEXT DAY HE FOUND THEM HALF EATEN BY WOLVES
7011-66622-0018 FROM THAT DAY ON MUKOKI WAS A DIFFERENT INDIAN HE BECAME THE GREATEST WOLF HUNTER IN ALL THESE REGIONS SOON AFTER THE TRAGEDY HE CAME TO THE POST TO LIVE AND SINCE THEN HE HAS NOT LEFT MINNETAKI AND ME ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE WHEN THE NIGHT IS JUST RIGHT
7011-66622-0019 MUKOKI SEEMS TO GO A LITTLE MAD HE CALLS THIS A WOLF NIGHT NO ONE CAN STOP HIM FROM GOING OUT NO ONE CAN GET HIM TO TALK HE WILL ALLOW NO ONE TO ACCOMPANY HIM WHEN IN SUCH A MOOD HE WILL WALK MILES AND MILES TO NIGHT BUT HE WILL COME BACK
7011-66622-0020 AND WHEN HE RETURNS HE WILL BE AS SANE AS YOU AND I
7011-66622-0021 ROD HAD LISTENED IN RAPT ATTENTION TO HIM AS WABI PROCEEDED WITH HIS STORY OF THE TRAGEDY IN MUKOKI'S LIFE THE OLD INDIAN WAS TRANSFORMED INTO ANOTHER BEING NO LONGER WAS HE A MERE SAVAGE RECLAIMED A LITTLE FROM THE WILDERNESS
7011-66622-0022 THERE HAD SPRUNG UP IN ROD'S BREAST A GREAT HUMAN THROBBING SYMPATHY FOR HIM AND IN THE DIM CANDLE GLOW HIS EYES GLISTENED WITH A DAMPNESS WHICH HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL WHAT DOES MUKOKI MEAN BY WOLF NIGHT HE ASKED
7011-66622-0023 MUKY IS A WIZARD WHEN IT COMES TO HUNTING WOLVES WABI WENT ON HE HAS STUDIED THEM AND THOUGHT OF THEM EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT WOLVES THAN ALL THE REST OF THE HUNTERS IN THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER HE CAN CATCH THEM IN EVERY TRAP HE SETS
7011-66622-0024 WHICH NO OTHER TRAPPER IN THE WORLD CAN DO HE CAN TELL YOU A HUNDRED DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT A CERTAIN WOLF SIMPLY BY ITS TRACK AND BECAUSE OF HIS WONDERFUL KNOWLEDGE HE CAN TELL BY SOME INSTINCT THAT IS ALMOST SUPERNATURAL WHEN A WOLF NIGHT COMES
7011-66622-0025 SOMETHING IN THE AIR TO NIGHT SOMETHING IN THE SKY IN THE MOON IN THE VERY WAY THE WILDERNESS LOOKS TELLS HIM THAT STRAY WOLVES IN THE PLAINS AND HILLS ARE PACKING OR BANDING TOGETHER TO NIGHT AND THAT IN THE MORNING THE SUN WILL BE SHINING AND THEY WILL BE ON THE SUNNY SIDES OF THE MOUNTAINS
7011-66622-0026 SEE IF I AM NOT RIGHT TO MORROW NIGHT IF MUKOKI COMES BACK BY THEN WE SHALL HAVE SOME EXCITING SPORT WITH THE WOLVES AND THEN YOU WILL SEE HOW WOLF OUT THERE DOES HIS WORK THERE FOLLOWED SEVERAL MINUTES OF SILENCE
7011-66622-0027 THE STOVE GLOWED RED HOT AND THE BOYS SAT AND LOOKED AND LISTENED ROD TOOK OUT HIS WATCH IT LACKED ONLY TEN MINUTES OF MIDNIGHT YET NEITHER SEEMED POSSESSED WITH A DESIRE TO RETURN TO THEIR INTERRUPTED SLEEP WOLF IS A CURIOUS BEAST MUSED WABI SOFTLY
7011-66622-0028 YOU MIGHT THINK HE WAS A SNEAKING TRAITOROUS CUR OF A WOLF TO TURN AGAINST HIS OWN BREED AND LURE THEM TO DEATH BUT HE ISN'T WOLF AS WELL AS MUKOKI HAS GOOD CAUSE FOR WHAT HE DOES YOU MIGHT CALL IT ANIMAL VENGEANCE
7011-66622-0029 AND IF YOU THRUST BACK HIS HEAD YOU WILL FIND A TERRIBLE SEAR IN HIS THROAT AND FROM HIS LEFT SIDE JUST BACK OF THE FORE LEG A CHUNK OF FLESH HALF AS BIG AS MY HAND HAS BEEN TORN AWAY WE CAUGHT WOLF IN A LYNX TRAP MUKOKI AND I HE WASN'T MUCH MORE THAN A WHELP THEN
7011-66622-0030 ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLD MUKOKI SAID AND WHILE HE WAS IN THE TRAP HELPLESS AND UNABLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF THREE OR FOUR OF HIS LOVELY TRIBE JUMPED UPON HIM AND TRIED TO KILL HIM FOR BREAKFAST WE HOVE IN SIGHT JUST IN TIME TO DRIVE THE CANNIBALS OFF
7011-66622-0031 WE KEPT WOLF SEWED UP HIS SIDE AND THROAT TAMED HIM AND TO MORROW NIGHT YOU WILL SEE HOW MUKOKI HAS TAUGHT HIM TO GET EVEN WITH HIS PEOPLE IT WAS TWO HOURS LATER WHEN ROD AND WABIGOON EXTINGUISHED THE CANDLES AND RETURNED TO THEIR BLANKETS
7011-66622-0032 AND FOR ANOTHER HOUR AFTER THAT THE FORMER FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP HE WONDERED WHERE MUKOKI WAS WONDERED WHAT HE WAS DOING AND HOW IN HIS STRANGE MADNESS HE FOUND HIS WAY IN THE TRACKLESS WILDERNESS WHEN HE FINALLY FELL ASLEEP IT WAS TO DREAM OF THE INDIAN MOTHER AND HER CHILD
7011-66622-0033 AND THE WOMAN CHANGED INTO MINNETAKI AND THE RAVENOUS WOLVES INTO MEN
7011-66622-0034 POINTING OVER AND BEYOND HIM AND NODDING HIS HEAD ROD LOOKED AND CAUGHT HIS BREATH THERE WAS MUKOKI PEELING POTATOES HELLO MUKY HE SHOUTED THE OLD INDIAN LOOKED UP WITH A GRIN
7011-66622-0035 HIS FACE BORE NO SIGNS OF HIS MAD NIGHT ON THE TRAIL HE NODDED CHEERFULLY AND PROCEEDED WITH THE PREPARATION OF BREAKFAST AS THOUGH HE HAD JUST RISEN FROM HIS BLANKETS AFTER A LONG NIGHT'S REST BETTER GET UP HE ADVISED BIG DAY'S HUNT
7011-66622-0036 MUCH FINE SUNSHINE TO DAY FIND WOLVES ON MOUNTAIN PLENTY WOLVES THE BOYS TUMBLED FROM THEIR BLANKETS AND BEGAN DRESSING WHAT TIME DID YOU GET IN ASKED WABI NOW REPLIED MUKOKI
7011-66622-0037 JUST MAKE FIRE GOOD WABI GAVE ROD A SUGGESTIVE LOOK AS THE OLD INDIAN BENT OVER THE STOVE WHAT WERE YOU DOING LAST NIGHT HE QUESTIONED BIG MOON MIGHT GET SHOT GRUNTED MUKOKI SEE LYNX ON HILL
7011-66622-0038 SEE WOLF TRACKS ON RED DEER TRAIL NO SHOT THIS WAS AS MUCH OF THE HISTORY OF MUKOKI'S NIGHT ON THE TRAIL AS THE BOYS COULD SECURE BUT DURING THEIR BREAKFAST WABI SHOT ANOTHER GLANCE AT ROD AND AS MUKOKI LEFT THE TABLE FOR A MOMENT TO CLOSE THE DAMPER IN THE STOVE
7011-66622-0039 HE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO WHISPER SEE IF I'M NOT RIGHT
7011-66622-0040 I'M GOING WITH YOU MUKOKI MUKOKI WHO WAS SOMEWHAT FLATTERED BY THIS PREFERENCE OF THE WHITE YOUTH GRINNED AND CHUCKLED AND BEGAN TO TALK MORE VOLUBLY ABOUT THE PLANS WHICH WERE IN HIS HEAD
7011-66622-0041 ROD NOTICED THAT THE CAPTIVE WOLF RECEIVED NO BREAKFAST THAT MORNING AND HE EASILY GUESSED THE REASON THE TRAPS WERE NOW DIVIDED THREE DIFFERENT SIZES HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM THE POST FIFTY SMALL ONES FOR MINK MARTEN AND OTHER SMALL FUR ANIMALS
7011-66622-0042 FIFTEEN FOX TRAPS AND AS MANY LARGER ONES FOR LYNX AND WOLVES WABI EQUIPPED HIMSELF WITH TWENTY OF THE SMALL TRAPS AND FOUR EACH OF FOX AND LYNX TRAPS
7011-66622-0043 THE SUN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW ITSELF ABOVE THE WILDERNESS WHEN THE HUNTERS LEFT CAMP AS MUKOKI HAD PREDICTED IT WAS A GLORIOUS DAY ONE OF THOSE BITTERLY COLD CLOUDLESS DAYS WHEN AS THE INDIANS BELIEVE
7011-66622-0044 THE GREAT CREATOR ROBS THE REST OF THE WORLD OF THE SUN THAT IT MAY SHINE IN ALL ITS GLORY UPON THEIR OWN SAVAGE LAND FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL THAT SHELTERED THEIR HOME ROD LOOKED OUT OVER THE GLISTENING FORESTS AND LAKES IN RAPT AND SPEECHLESS ADMIRATION
7011-66622-0045 AT THE FOOT OF THIS HILL MUKOKI AND HIS COMPANION STRUCK THE CREEK THEY HAD NOT PROGRESSED MORE THAN FIFTY RODS WHEN THE OLD INDIAN STOPPED AND POINTED AT A FALLEN LOG WHICH SPANNED THE STREAM THE SNOW ON THIS LOG WAS BEATEN BY TINY FOOTPRINTS
7011-66622-0046 TAKING CARE NOT TO TOUCH THE LOG ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE TRACKS SPREAD OUT OVER A WINDFALL OF TREES
7011-66622-0047 CONTINUED MUKOKI T'REE MEBBY FOUR MEBBY FIVE BUILD TRAP HOUSE RIGHT HERE NEVER BEFORE HAD ROD SEEN A TRAP SET AS THE OLD INDIAN NOW SET HIS VERY NEAR THE END OF THE LOG OVER WHICH THE MINK MADE THEIR TRAIL HE QUICKLY BUILT A SHELTER OF STICKS
7011-66622-0048 WHICH WHEN COMPLETED WAS IN THE FORM OF A TINY WIGWAM AT THE BACK OF THIS WAS PLACED A CHUNK OF THE CARIBOU MEAT AND IN FRONT OF THIS BAIT SO THAT AN ANIMAL WOULD HAVE TO SPRING IT IN PASSING
7011-66622-0049 CAREFULLY COVERED WITH SNOW AND A FEW LEAVES WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES MUKOKI HAD BUILT TWO OF THESE SHELTERS AND HAD SET TWO TRAPS WHY DO YOU BUILD THOSE LITTLE HOUSES ASKED ROD AS THEY AGAIN TOOK UP THEIR TRAIL MUCH SNOW COME IN WINTER ELUCIDATED THE INDIAN
7011-66622-0050 BUILD HOUSE TO KEEP SNOW OFF TRAPS NO DO THAT BE DIGGING OUT TRAPS ALL WINTER WHEN MINK HEEM SMELL MEAT GO IN HOUSE HE GOT TO GO OVER TRAP MAKE HOUSE FOR ALL SMALL ANIMAL LIKE HEEM NO GOOD FOR LYNX HE SEE HOUSE
7011-66622-0051 SMART FELLOW LYNX WOLF AND FOX TOO IS A MINK WORTH MUCH FI DOLLAR
7011-66622-0052 SEVEN EIGHT DOLLAR FOR GOOD ONE DURING THE NEXT MILE SIX OTHER MINK TRAPS WERE SET
7011-66622-0053 NO LONGER DID HE SEEM ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN THE DISCOVERY OF SIGNS OF FUR ANIMALS
7011-66622-0054 HE SPOKE IN WHISPERS AND ROD FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE FREQUENTLY THE TWO WOULD STOP AND SCAN THE OPENINGS FOR SIGNS OF LIFE TWICE THEY SET FOX TRAPS WHERE THERE WERE EVIDENT SIGNS OF RUNWAYS IN A WILD RAVINE STREWN WITH TUMBLED TREES AND MASSES OF ROCK THEY STRUCK A LYNX TRACK
7011-66622-0055 AND SET A TRAP FOR HIM AT EACH END OF THE RAVINE BUT EVEN DURING THESE OPERATIONS MUKOKI'S INTEREST WAS DIVIDED THE HUNTERS NOW WALKED ABREAST ABOUT FIFTY YARDS APART ROD NEVER FORGING A FOOT AHEAD OF THE CAUTIOUS MUKOKI SUDDENLY THE YOUTH HEARD A LOW CALL
7011-66622-0056 WOLF WHISPERED MUKOKI AS ROD JOINED HIM
7011-66622-0057 T'REE WOLF CONTINUED THE INDIAN JUBILANTLY TRAVEL EARLY THIS MORNING SOMEWHERE IN WARM SUN ON MOUNTAIN THEY FOLLOWED NOW IN THE WOLF TRAIL A LITTLE WAY ON ROD FOUND PART OF THE CARCASS OF A RABBIT WITH FOX TRACKS ABOUT IT
7011-66622-0058 HERE MUKOKI SET ANOTHER TRAP A LITTLE FARTHER STILL THEY CAME ACROSS A FISHER TRAIL AND ANOTHER TRAP WAS LAID CARIBOU AND DEER TRACKS CROSSED AND RECROSSED THE CREEK BUT THE INDIAN PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO THEM
7011-66622-0059 A FOURTH WOLF JOINED THE PACK AND A FIFTH AND HALF AN HOUR LATER THE TRAIL OF THREE OTHER WOLVES CUT AT RIGHT ANGLES ACROSS THE ONE THEY WERE FOLLOWING AND DISAPPEARED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE THICKLY TIMBERED PLAINS MUKOKI'S FACE WAS CRINKLED WITH JOY
7011-66622-0060 MANY WOLF NEAR HE EXCLAIMED MANY WOLF OFF THERE N OFF THERE N OFF THERE GOOD PLACE FOR NIGHT HUNT SOON THE CREEK SWUNG OUT FROM THE RIDGE AND CUT A CIRCUITOUS CHANNEL THROUGH A SMALL SWAMP
7011-66622-0061 IN PLACES THE SNOW WAS LITERALLY PACKED WITH DEER TRACKS TRAILS RAN IN EVERY DIRECTION THE BARK HAD BEEN RUBBED FROM SCORES OF SAPLINGS AND EVERY STEP GAVE FRESH EVIDENCE OF THE NEAR PRESENCE OF GAME THE STEALTH WITH WHICH MUKOKI NOW ADVANCED WAS ALMOST PAINFUL
7011-66622-0062 EVERY TWIG WAS PRESSED BEHIND HIM NOISELESSLY AND ONCE WHEN ROD STRUCK HIS SNOW SHOE AGAINST THE BUTT OF A SMALL TREE THE OLD INDIAN HELD UP HIS HANDS IN MOCK HORROR TEN MINUTES FIFTEEN TWENTY OF THEM PASSED IN THIS CAUTIOUS BREATHLESS TRAILING OF THE SWAMP
7011-66622-0063 SUDDENLY MUKOKI STOPPED AND A HAND WAS HELD OUT BEHIND HIM WARNINGLY HE TURNED HIS FACE BACK AND ROD KNEW THAT HE SAW GAME INCH BY INCH HE CROUCHED UPON HIS SNOW SHOES AND BECKONED FOR ROD TO APPROACH SLOWLY QUIETLY
7011-66622-0064 WHEN THE BOY HAD COME NEAR ENOUGH HE PASSED BACK HIS RIFLE AND HIS LIPS FORMED THE ALMOST NOISELESS WORD SHOOT TREMBLINGLY ROD SEIZED THE GUN AND LOOKED INTO THE SWAMP AHEAD MUKOKI DOUBLING DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM
7011-66622-0065 WHAT HE SAW SENT HIM FOR A MOMENT INTO THE FIRST NERVOUS TREMOR OF BUCK FEVER NOT MORE THAN A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY STOOD A MAGNIFICENT BUCK BROWSING THE TIPS OF A CLUMP OF HAZEL
7011-66622-0066 WITH A POWERFUL EFFORT ROD STEADIED HIMSELF THE BUCK WAS STANDING BROADSIDE HIS HEAD AND NECK STRETCHED UP OFFERING A BEAUTIFUL SHOT AT THE VITAL SPOT BEHIND HIS FORE LEG AT THIS THE YOUNG HUNTER AIMED AND FIRED
7011-66622-0067 WITH ONE SPASMODIC BOUND THE ANIMAL DROPPED DEAD HARDLY HAD ROD SEEN THE EFFECT OF HIS SHOT BEFORE MUKOKI WAS TRAVELING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE FALLEN GAME UNSTRAPPING HIS PACK AS HE RAN
7011-66622-0068 WITHOUT EXPLANATION HE NOW PROCEEDED TO THRUST HIS KNIFE INTO THE QUIVERING ANIMAL'S THROAT AND FILL THIS FLASK WITH BLOOD WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS TASK HE HELD IT UP WITH AN AIR OF UNBOUNDED SATISFACTION BLOOD FOR WOLF HEEM LIKE BLOOD SMELL UM
7011-66622-0069 COME MAKE BIG SHOOT TO NIGHT NO BLOOD NO BAIT NO WOLF SHOOT
7011-66622-0070 AND IT WAS EVIDENT TO ROD THAT THE INDIAN CONSIDERED HIS MISSION FOR THAT DAY PRACTICALLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER TAKING THE HEART LIVER AND ONE OF THE HIND QUARTERS OF THE BUCK MUKOKI DREW A LONG ROPE OF BABEESH FROM HIS PACK TIED ONE END OF IT AROUND THE ANIMAL'S NECK FLUNG THE OTHER END OVER A NEAR LIMB
7011-66622-0071 AND WITH HIS COMPANION'S ASSISTANCE HOISTED THE CARCASS UNTIL IT WAS CLEAR OF THE GROUND IF SOMETHIN HAPPEN WE NO COME BACK TO NIGHT HEEM SAFE FROM WOLF HE EXPLAINED THE TWO NOW CONTINUED THROUGH THE SWAMP AT ITS FARTHER EDGE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY FROM THE CREEK TOWARD THE HILLS
7011-66622-0072 AND THIS SLOPING PLAIN WAS COVERED WITH HUGE BOULDERS AND A THIN GROWTH OF LARGE SPRUCE AND BIRCH JUST BEYOND THE CREEK WAS A GIGANTIC ROCK WHICH IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT MUKOKI'S ATTENTION
7011-66622-0073 AND EVEN THIS ONE COULD NOT BE CLIMBED WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF A SAPLING OR TWO THEY COULD SEE HOWEVER THAT THE TOP OF THE ROCK WAS FLAT AND MUKOKI CALLED ATTENTION TO THIS FACT WITH AN EXULTANT CHUCKLE FINE PLACE FOR WOLF HUNT HE EXCLAIMED MANY WOLF OFF THERE IN SWAMP AN IN HILL
7011-66622-0074 SHOOT FROM THERE HE POINTED TO A CLUMP OF SPRUCE A DOZEN RODS AWAY BY ROD'S WATCH IT WAS NOW NEARLY NOON AND THE TWO SAT DOWN TO EAT THE SANDWICHES THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM ONLY A FEW MINUTES WERE LOST IN TAKING UP THE HOME TRAIL
7011-66622-0075 BEYOND THE SWAMP MUKOKI CUT AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THEIR TRAP LINE UNTIL HE HAD ASCENDED TO THE TOP OF THE RIDGE THAT HAD BEEN ON THEIR RIGHT AND WHICH WOULD TAKE THEM VERY NEAR THEIR CAMP FROM THIS RIDGE ROD COULD LOOK ABOUT HIM UPON A WILD AND RUGGED SCENE
7011-66622-0076 BUT ON THE OTHER IT FELL IN ALMOST SHEER WALLS FORMING AT ITS BASE FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW A NARROW AND GLOOMY CHASM THROUGH WHICH A SMALL STREAM FOUND ITS WAY SEVERAL TIMES MUKOKI STOPPED AND LEANED PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO THE DIZZY EDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN
7011-66622-0077 PEERING DOWN WITH CRITICAL EYES AND ONCE WHEN HE PULLED HIMSELF BACK CAUTIOUSLY BY MEANS OF A SMALL SAPLING HE EXPLAINED HIS INTEREST BY SAYING PLENTY BEAR THERE IN SPRING BUT ROD WAS NOT THINKING OF BEARS
7011-66622-0078 ONCE MORE HIS HEAD WAS FILLED WITH THE THOUGHT OF GOLD PERHAPS THAT VERY CHASM HELD THE PRICELESS SECRET THAT HAD DIED WITH ITS OWNERS HALF A CENTURY AGO THE DARK AND GLOOMY SILENCE THAT HUNG BETWEEN THOSE TWO WALLS OF ROCK THE DEATH LIKE DESOLATION THE STEALTHY WINDINGS OF THE CREEK
7011-66622-0079 EVERYTHING IN THAT DIM AND MYSTERIOUS WORLD BETWEEN THE TWO MOUNTAINS UNSHATTERED BY SOUND AND IMPENETRABLE TO THE WINTER SUN SEEMED IN HIS MIND TO LINK ITSELF WITH THE TRAGEDY OF LONG AGO DID THAT CHASM HOLD THE SECRET OF THE DEAD MEN
7011-66622-0080 UNTIL AT LAST WITH A CURIOUS THRILLING CERTAINTY THAT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING HE CAUGHT MUKOKI BY THE ARM AND POINTING BACK SAID
