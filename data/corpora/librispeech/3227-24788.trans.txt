3227-24788-0000 IS THAT VERY LOVE OF GOD WHEREBY GOD LOVES HIMSELF NOT IN SO FAR AS HE IS INFINITE BUT IN SO FAR AS HE CAN BE EXPLAINED THROUGH THE ESSENCE OF THE HUMAN MIND
3227-24788-0001 THIS LOVE OF THE MIND IS PART OF THE INFINITE LOVE WHEREWITH GOD LOVES HIMSELF
3227-24788-0002 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IN SO FAR AS HE LOVES HIMSELF LOVES MAN AND CONSEQUENTLY
3227-24788-0003 THAT THE LOVE OF GOD TOWARDS MEN AND THE INTELLECTUAL LOVE OF THE MIND TOWARDS GOD ARE IDENTICAL NOTE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID WE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND
3227-24788-0004 AS TO ITS ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE FOLLOWS FROM THE DIVINE NATURE AND CONSTANTLY DEPENDS ON GOD
3227-24788-0005 IN ORDER TO SHOW BY THIS EXAMPLE HOW THE KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULAR THINGS WHICH I HAVE CALLED INTUITIVE OR OF THE THIRD KIND
3227-24788-0006 WHICH I HAVE STYLED KNOWLEDGE OF THE SECOND KIND
3227-24788-0007 AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO THE HUMAN MIND
3227-24788-0008 DOES NOT AFFECT OUR MIND SO MUCH AS WHEN THE SAME CONCLUSION IS DERIVED FROM THE ACTUAL ESSENCE OF SOME PARTICULAR THING WHICH WE SAY DEPENDS ON GOD
3227-24788-0009 I THERE IS NOTHING IN NATURE WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THIS INTELLECTUAL LOVE
3227-24788-0010 AND CONSEQUENTLY IN PROPORTION AS THE MIND LOVES GOD MORE
3227-24788-0011 ACCORDING TO THE INTELLECTUAL ORDER AND CONSEQUENTLY OF BRINGING IT ABOUT THAT ALL THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE BODY SHOULD BE REFERRED TO THE IDEA OF GOD
3227-24788-0012 MUST OCCUPY OR CONSTITUTE
3227-24788-0013 AND THEREFORE THAT THEY SHOULD SCARCELY FEAR DEATH BUT IN ORDER THAT THIS MAY BE UNDERSTOOD MORE CLEARLY WE MUST HERE CALL TO MIND THAT WE LIVE IN A STATE OF PERPETUAL VARIATION
3227-24788-0014 WE ARE CALLED HAPPY OR UNHAPPY FOR HE WHO FROM BEING AN INFANT OR A CHILD BECOMES A CORPSE IS CALLED UNHAPPY WHEREAS IT IS SET DOWN TO HAPPINESS IF WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LIVE THROUGH THE WHOLE PERIOD OF LIFE
3227-24788-0015 WITH A SOUND MIND IN A SOUND BODY AND IN REALITY HE WHO AS IN THE CASE OF AN INFANT OR A CHILD HAS A BODY CAPABLE OF VERY FEW ACTIVITIES
3227-24788-0016 IS SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF OR OF GOD OR OF THINGS
3227-24788-0017 HAS A MIND WHICH CONSIDERED IN ITSELF ALONE
3227-24788-0018 IN THIS LIFE THEREFORE WE PRIMARILY ENDEAVOUR TO BRING IT ABOUT
3227-24788-0019 MAY BE CHANGED INTO SOMETHING ELSE CAPABLE OF VERY MANY ACTIVITIES AND REFERABLE TO A MIND WHICH IS HIGHLY CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF OF GOD AND OF THINGS
3227-24788-0020 AND WE DESIRE SO TO CHANGE IT THAT WHAT IS REFERRED TO ITS IMAGINATION AND MEMORY MAY BECOME INSIGNIFICANT IN COMPARISON WITH ITS INTELLECT AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID IN THE NOTE TO THE LAST PROPOSITION
3227-24788-0021 SO IS IT MORE ACTIVE AND LESS PASSIVE AND VICE VERSA IN PROPORTION AS IT IS MORE ACTIVE SO IS IT MORE PERFECT
3227-24788-0022 IN PROPORTION AS EACH THING IS MORE PERFECT
3227-24788-0023 AND CONSEQUENTLY
3227-24788-0024 BE IT GREAT OR SMALL IS MORE PERFECT THAN THE LATTER
3227-24788-0025 NOTE SUCH ARE THE DOCTRINES WHICH I HAD PURPOSED TO SET FORTH CONCERNING THE MIND IN SO FAR AS IT IS REGARDED WITHOUT RELATION TO THE BODY
3227-24788-0026 IT IS PLAIN THAT OUR MIND IN SO FAR AS IT UNDERSTANDS IS AN ETERNAL MODE OF THINKING WHICH IS DETERMINED BY ANOTHER ETERNAL MODE OF THINKING AND THIS OTHER BY A THIRD AND SO ON TO INFINITY
