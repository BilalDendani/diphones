1559-139353-0000 BRAZA BURNING EMBERS
1559-139353-0001 IT HAS BEEN USED TO MAKE THE WORD BRAZIL AS DESCRIPTIVE OF CERTAIN WOODS WHICH YIELD A REDDISH DYE FROM THIS HAS COME THE NAME BRAZIL GIVEN TO THAT VAST DISTRICT OF SOUTH AMERICA WHICH IS CROSSED BY THE EQUATOR AND IN WHICH THESE PRODUCTS ARE SO FREQUENTLY MET WITH
1559-139353-0002 IN VERY EARLY DAYS THESE WOODS WERE THE OBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE TRADE
1559-139353-0003 BRAZIL WAS FROM THE FIRST OCCUPIED BY THE PORTUGUESE ABOUT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY ALVAREZ CABRAL THE PILOT TOOK POSSESSION OF IT AND ALTHOUGH FRANCE AND HOLLAND PARTIALLY ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES THERE IT HAS REMAINED PORTUGUESE
1559-139353-0004 IT IS TO DAY THE LARGEST STATE OF SOUTH AMERICA AND HAS AT ITS HEAD THE INTELLIGENT ARTIST KING DOM PEDRO
1559-139353-0005 THE PRIVILEGE OF MARCHING FIRST TO BATTLE INNOCENTLY ANSWERED THE INDIAN WAR WE KNOW WAS FOR A LONG TIME THE SUREST AND MOST RAPID VEHICLE OF CIVILIZATION THE BRAZILIANS DID WHAT THIS INDIAN DID THEY FOUGHT THEY DEFENDED THEIR CONQUESTS THEY ENLARGED THEM
1559-139353-0006 AND WE SEE THEM MARCHING IN THE FIRST RANK OF THE CIVILIZING ADVANCE IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FOUNDATION OF THE PORTUGO BRAZILIAN EMPIRE THAT BRAZIL PROCLAIMED ITS INDEPENDENCE BY THE VOICE OF DON JUAN WHOM THE FRENCH ARMIES HAD CHASED FROM PORTUGAL
1559-139353-0007 IT REMAINED ONLY TO DEFINE THE FRONTIER BETWEEN THE NEW EMPIRE AND THAT OF ITS NEIGHBOR PERU THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER
1559-139353-0008 PERU ATTEMPTED TO REACH EIGHT DEGREES FURTHER AS FAR AS THE LAKE OF EGA BUT IN THE MEANTIME BRAZIL HAD TO INTERFERE TO HINDER THE KIDNAPING OF THE INDIANS FROM THE AMAZON A PRACTICE WHICH WAS ENGAGED IN MUCH TO THE PROFIT OF THE HISPANO BRAZILIAN MISSIONS
1559-139353-0009 A LITTLE ABOVE TABATINGA AND THERE ESTABLISHING A POST THIS AFFORDED THE SOLUTION AND FROM THAT TIME THE FRONTIER OF THE TWO COUNTRIES PASSED THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THIS ISLAND ABOVE THE RIVER IS PERUVIAN
1559-139353-0010 AS HAS BEEN SAID BELOW IT IS BRAZILIAN AND TAKES THE NAME OF THE AMAZON IT WAS ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JUNE THAT THE JANGADA STOPPED BEFORE TABATINGA THE FIRST BRAZILIAN TOWN SITUATED ON THE LEFT BANK AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE RIVER OF WHICH IT BEARS THE NAME
1559-139353-0011 AND BELONGING TO THE PARISH OF SAINT PAUL ESTABLISHED ON THE RIGHT A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN STREAM JOAM GARRAL HAD DECIDED TO PASS THIRTY SIX HOURS HERE SO AS TO GIVE A LITTLE REST TO THE CREW THEY WOULD NOT START THEREFORE UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE TWENTY SEVENTH
1559-139353-0012 ON THIS OCCASION YAQUITA AND HER CHILDREN
1559-139353-0013 HAD ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION OF GOING ON ASHORE AND VISITING THE TOWN
1559-139353-0014 NEARLY ALL INDIANS COMPRISING NO DOUBT MANY OF THOSE WANDERING FAMILIES
1559-139353-0015 AND TRANSFERRED TO TABATINGA IT CAN THUS BE CALLED A GARRISON TOWN BUT THE GARRISON IS ONLY COMPOSED OF NINE SOLDIERS NEARLY ALL INDIANS AND A SERGEANT WHO IS THE ACTUAL COMMANDANT OF THE PLACE A BANK ABOUT THIRTY FEET HIGH IN WHICH ARE CUT THE STEPS OF A NOT VERY SOLID STAIRCASE
1559-139353-0016 WHICH CARRIES THE PIGMY FORT THE HOUSE OF THE COMMANDANT CONSISTS OF A COUPLE OF HUTS PLACED IN A SQUARE AND THE SOLDIERS OCCUPY AN OBLONG BUILDING A HUNDRED FEET AWAY AT THE FOOT OF A LARGE TREE
1559-139353-0017 ALTHOUGH IN THEM A FLAGSTAFF CARRYING THE BRAZILIAN COLORS DOES NOT RISE ABOVE A SENTRY BOX FOREVER DESTITUTE OF ITS SENTINEL NOR ARE FOUR SMALL MORTARS PRESENT TO CANNONADE
1559-139353-0018 AS FOR THE VILLAGE PROPERLY SO CALLED IT IS SITUATED BELOW AT THE BASE OF THE PLATEAU A ROAD WHICH IS BUT A RAVINE SHADED BY FICUSES AND MIRITIS LEADS TO IT IN A FEW MINUTES
1559-139353-0019 THERE ON A HALF CRACKED HILL OF CLAY STAND A DOZEN HOUSES COVERED WITH THE LEAVES OF THE BOIASSU PALM PLACED ROUND A CENTRAL SPACE
1559-139353-0020 WHICH IS OF SUFFICIENT EXTENT TO CONTAIN THE ARCHIPELAGO OF THE ARAMASA ISLANDS HEREABOUTS ARE GROUPED MANY FINE TREES AND AMONG THEM A LARGE NUMBER OF THE PALMS WHOSE SUPPLE FIBERS ARE USED IN THE FABRICATION OF HAMMOCKS AND FISHING NETS AND ARE THE CAUSE OF SOME TRADE
1559-139353-0021 TO CONCLUDE THE PLACE IS ONE OF THE MOST PICTURESQUE ON THE UPPER AMAZON
1559-139353-0022 AND WILL NO DOUBT RAPIDLY DEVELOP FOR THERE WILL STOP THE BRAZILIAN STEAMERS WHICH ASCEND THE RIVER AND THE PERUVIAN STEAMERS WHICH DESCEND IT THERE THEY WILL TRANSHIP PASSENGERS AND CARGOES IT DOES NOT REQUIRE MUCH FOR AN ENGLISH OR AMERICAN VILLAGE TO BECOME IN A FEW YEARS THE CENTER OF CONSIDERABLE COMMERCE
1559-139353-0023 THE INFLUENCE OF ORDINARY TIDES IS NOT PERCEPTIBLE AT TABATINGA WHICH IS MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM THE ATLANTIC BUT IT IS NOT SO WITH THE POROROCA THAT SPECIES OF EDDY WHICH FOR THREE DAYS IN THE HEIGHT OF THE SYZYGIES RAISES THE WATERS OF THE AMAZON AND TURNS THEM BACK AT THE RATE OF SEVENTEEN KILOMETERS PER HOUR
1559-139353-0024 THEY SAY THAT THE EFFECTS OF THIS BORE ARE FELT UP TO THE BRAZILIAN FRONTIER ON THE MORROW THE TWENTY SIXTH OF JUNE THE GARRAL FAMILY PREPARED TO GO OFF AND VISIT THE VILLAGE
1559-139353-0025 FOR THEM IT WAS SO TO SPEAK A TAKING POSSESSION IT IS CONCEIVABLE THEREFORE THAT YAQUITA AND MINHA

1559-139353-0034 THEY WILL STRUGGLE FOR MY FAVORS
1559-139353-0035 AND THE WHOLE TRIBE OF THE TICUNAS WOULD COME TO ME TO HAVE THEIR HAIR LOOKED AFTER THEY WON'T HESITATE TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF CURLING TONGS' THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL CALL ME IF I REVISIT THE WALLS OF TABATINGA I HAVE ALREADY HAD TWO TRIES HERE AND MY SCISSORS AND COMB HAVE DONE MARVELS
1559-139353-0036 THE INDIAN LADIES DON'T HAVE THEIR HAIR CURLED EVERY DAY LIKE THE BEAUTIES OF OUR BRAZILIAN CITIES
1559-139353-0037 THEY WILL TAKE EVERY CARE NOT TO ENDANGER THE EDIFICE WHICH I HAVE RAISED WITH WHAT TALENT I DARE NOT SAY
1559-139353-0038 AND IF IT IS NOT OBJECTIONABLE TO YOU MISTER GARRAL I WOULD RENDER MYSELF AGAIN WORTHY OF THE REPUTATION WHICH I HAVE ACQUIRED IN THESE PARTS

1559-139353-0041 AND SO SAYING FRAGOSO RAPIDLY MOVED AWAY A MOMENT AFTERWARD THE FAMILY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JOAM WENT ASHORE
1559-139353-0042 A STAIRCASE IN A MISERABLE STATE CUT IN THE CLIFF
1559-139353-0043 A POOR FELLOW WHO HOWEVER KNEW THE LAWS OF HOSPITALITY AND OFFERED THEM SOME BREAKFAST IN HIS COTTAGE
1559-139353-0044 WITH THEIR MOTHERS OF TICUNA BLOOD AFFORDING VERY POOR SPECIMENS OF THE MIXED RACE
1559-139353-0045 THE COMMANDANT DID NOT WAIT FOR A SECOND INVITATION AND AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK
1559-139353-0046 WENT FOR A WALK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEAVING BENITO TO SETTLE WITH THE COMMANDANT ABOUT THE TOLLS HE BEING CHIEF OF THE CUSTOM HOUSE AS WELL AS OF THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT THAT DONE BENITO AS WAS HIS WONT STROLLED OFF WITH HIS GUN INTO THE ADJOINING WOODS
1559-139353-0047 ON THIS OCCASION MANOEL HAD DECLINED TO ACCOMPANY HIM FRAGOSO HAD LEFT THE JANGADA BUT INSTEAD OF MOUNTING TO THE FORT HE HAD MADE FOR THE VILLAGE
1559-139353-0048 HE RECKONED MORE ON THE NATIVE CUSTOM OF TABATINGA THAN ON THAT OF THE GARRISON DOUBTLESS THE SOLDIERS WIVES WOULD NOT HAVE WISHED BETTER
1559-139353-0049 BUT THE HUSBANDS SCARCELY CARED TO PART WITH A FEW REIS FOR THE SAKE OF GRATIFYING THE WHIMS OF THEIR COQUETTISH PARTNERS AMONG THE NATIVES IT WAS QUITE THE REVERSE HUSBANDS AND WIVES THE JOLLY BARBER KNEW THEM WELL AND HE KNEW THEY WOULD GIVE HIM A BETTER RECEPTION
1559-139353-0050 BEHOLD THEN FRAGOSO ON THE ROAD COMING UP THE SHADY LANE BENEATH THE FICUSES AND ARRIVING IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE OF TABATINGA AS SOON AS HE SET FOOT IN THE PLACE THE FAMOUS BARBER WAS SIGNALED RECOGNIZED SURROUNDED
1559-139353-0051 NOT EVEN A CARRIAGE OF SHINING COPPER WITH RESPLENDENT LAMPS AND ORNAMENTED GLASS PANELS NOR A HUGE PARASOL NO ANYTHING WHATEVER TO IMPRESS THE PUBLIC AS THEY GENERALLY HAVE AT FAIRS NO BUT FRAGOSO HAD HIS CUP AND BALL
1559-139353-0052 WITH WHAT ADDRESS DID HE RECEIVE THE TURTLE'S HEAD WHICH DID FOR THE BALL ON THE POINTED END OF THE STICK WITH WHAT GRACE DID HE MAKE THE BALL DESCRIBE SOME LEARNED CURVE OF WHICH MATHEMATICIANS HAVE NOT YET CALCULATED THE VALUE EVEN THOSE WHO HAVE DETERMINED THE WONDROUS CURVE OF THE DOG WHO FOLLOWS HIS MASTER
1559-139353-0053 EVERY NATIVE WAS THERE MEN WOMEN THE OLD AND THE YOUNG IN THEIR NEARLY PRIMITIVE COSTUME LOOKING ON WITH ALL THEIR EYES LISTENING WITH ALL THEIR EARS THE SMILING ENTERTAINER HALF IN PORTUGUESE HALF IN TICUNIAN FAVORED THEM WITH HIS CUSTOMARY ORATION
1559-139353-0054 IN A TONE OF THE MOST ROLLICKING GOOD HUMOR WHAT HE SAID WAS WHAT IS SAID BY ALL THE CHARLATANS WHO PLACE THEIR SERVICES AT THE PUBLIC DISPOSAL WHETHER THEY BE SPANISH FIGAROS OR FRENCH PERRUQIERS
1559-139353-0055 THE SAME DESCRIPTION OF THREADBARE WITTICISMS THE SAME AMUSING DEXTERITY AND ON THE PART OF THE NATIVES THE SAME WIDE MOUTH ASTONISHMENT THE SAME CURIOSITY THE SAME CREDULITY AS THE SIMPLE FOLK OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD IT FOLLOWED THEN THAT TEN MINUTES LATER THE PUBLIC WERE COMPLETELY WON
1559-139353-0056 AND CROWDED ROUND FRAGOSO WHO WAS INSTALLED IN A LOJA OF THE PLACE A SORT OF SERVING BAR TO THE INN
1559-139353-0057 THE NATIVES COULD GET DRINKS OF THE CRUDEST AND PARTICULARLY ASSAI A LIQUOR HALF SOLD HALF LIQUID MADE OF THE FRUIT OF THE PALM TREE AND DRUNK FROM A COUI OR HALF CALABASH IN GENERAL USE IN THIS DISTRICT OF THE AMAZON
1559-139353-0058 AND THEN MEN AND WOMEN WITH EQUAL EAGERNESS TOOK THEIR PLACES ON THE BARBER'S STOOL THE SCISSORS OF FRAGOSO HAD LITTLE TO DO
1559-139353-0059 BUT THE USE TO WHICH HE COULD PUT HIS COMB AND THE TONGS WHICH WERE KEPT WARMING IN THE CORNER IN A BRASIER
1559-139353-0060 LOOK HERE LOOK HERE SAID HE HOW WILL THAT DO MY FRIENDS IF YOU DON'T SLEEP ON THE TOP OF IT
1559-139353-0061 NO HE WAS NOT STINGY WITH IT TRUE IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE GREASE WITH WHICH HE HAD MIXED SOME OF THE JUICES OF A FEW FLOWERS BUT HE PLASTERED IT ON LIKE CEMENT
1559-139353-0062 BUCKLES RINGS CLUBS TRESSES CRIMPINGS ROLLS CORKSCREWS CURLS EVERYTHING FOUND THERE A PLACE NOTHING FALSE NO TOWERS NO CHIGNONS NO SHAMS
1559-139353-0063 FRAGOSO HOWEVER WAS NOT ABOVE ADDING A FEW NATURAL FLOWERS TWO OR THREE LONG FISH BONES AND SOME FINE BONE OR COPPER ORNAMENTS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HIM BY THE DANDIES OF THE DISTRICT ASSUREDLY THE EXQUISITES OF THE DIRECTORY WOULD HAVE ENVIED THE ARRANGEMENT OF THESE HIGH ART COIFFURES THREE AND FOUR STORIES HIGH
1559-139353-0064 WHICH RAINED INTO THE POCKET OF FRAGOSO AND WHICH HE COLLECTED WITH EVIDENT SATISFACTION
1559-139353-0065 THE NEWS OF THE ARRIVAL OF FRAGOSO WAS NOT SLOW TO GET ABROAD NATIVES CAME TO HIM FROM ALL SIDES TICUNAS FROM THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER MAYORUNAS FROM THE RIGHT BANK
1559-139353-0066 AND THOSE WHO COME FROM THE VILLAGES OF THE JAVARY A LONG ARRAY OF ANXIOUS ONES FORMED ITSELF IN THE SQUARE
1559-139353-0067 SHOWED THEMSELVES OFF WITHOUT DARING TO SHAKE THEMSELVES LIKE THE BIG CHILDREN THAT THEY WERE IT THUS HAPPENED THAT WHEN NOON CAME THE MUCH OCCUPIED BARBER HAD NOT HAD TIME TO RETURN ON BOARD BUT HAD HAD TO CONTENT HIMSELF
1559-139353-0068 WHICH HE RAPIDLY DEVOURED BETWEEN TWO APPLICATIONS OF THE CURLING TONGS BUT IT WAS A GREAT HARVEST FOR THE INNKEEPER
