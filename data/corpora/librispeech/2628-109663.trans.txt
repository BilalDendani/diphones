2628-109663-0000 I WAS WALKING IN CENTRAL PARK WITH AVERY KNIGHT THE GREAT NEW YORK BURGLAR HIGHWAYMAN AND MURDERER BUT MY DEAR KNIGHT SAID I IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE
2628-109663-0001 YOU HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY PERFORMED SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL FEATS IN YOUR PROFESSION KNOWN TO MODERN CRIME YOU HAVE COMMITTED SOME MARVELLOUS DEEDS UNDER THE VERY NOSES OF THE POLICE
2628-109663-0002 YOU CAN RUN DOWN AND ACTUALLY BRING ME FACE TO FACE WITH THE DETECTIVE ASSIGNED TO APPREHEND YOU I MUST BEG LEAVE TO EXPRESS MY DOUBTS REMEMBER YOU ARE IN NEW YORK
2628-109663-0003 AVERY KNIGHT SMILED INDULGENTLY YOU PIQUE MY PROFESSIONAL PRIDE DOCTOR HE SAID IN A NETTLED TONE I WILL CONVINCE YOU
2628-109663-0004 ABOUT TWELVE YARDS IN ADVANCE OF US A PROSPEROUS LOOKING CITIZEN WAS ROUNDING A CLUMP OF BUSHES WHERE THE WALK CURVED KNIGHT SUDDENLY DREW A REVOLVER AND SHOT THE MAN IN THE BACK HIS VICTIM FELL AND LAY WITHOUT MOVING
2628-109663-0005 THE GREAT MURDERER WENT UP TO HIM LEISURELY AND TOOK FROM HIS CLOTHES HIS MONEY WATCH AND A VALUABLE RING AND CRAVAT PIN HE THEN REJOINED ME SMILING CALMLY AND WE CONTINUED OUR WALK
2628-109663-0006 TEN STEPS AND WE MET A POLICEMAN RUNNING TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED AVERY KNIGHT STOPPED HIM I HAVE JUST KILLED A MAN HE ANNOUNCED SERIOUSLY AND ROBBED HIM OF HIS POSSESSIONS
2628-109663-0007 WHAT YOU HAVE DONE I SAID ARGUMENTATIVELY AS KNIGHT AND I WALKED ON WAS EASY BUT WHEN YOU COME TO THE TASK OF HUNTING DOWN THE DETECTIVE THAT THEY SEND UPON YOUR TRAIL YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU HAVE UNDERTAKEN A DIFFICULT FEAT
2628-109663-0008 PERHAPS SO SAID KNIGHT LIGHTLY I WILL ADMIT THAT MY SUCCESS DEPENDS IN A DEGREE UPON THE SORT OF MAN THEY START AFTER ME IF IT SHOULD BE AN ORDINARY PLAIN CLOTHES MAN I MIGHT FAIL TO GAIN A SIGHT OF HIM
2628-109663-0009 IF THEY HONOR ME BY GIVING THE CASE TO SOME ONE OF THEIR CELEBRATED SLEUTHS I DO NOT FEAR TO MATCH MY CUNNING AND POWERS OF INDUCTION AGAINST HIS ON THE NEXT AFTERNOON KNIGHT ENTERED MY OFFICE WITH A SATISFIED LOOK ON HIS KEEN COUNTENANCE
2628-109663-0010 HOW GOES THE MYSTERIOUS MURDER I ASKED AS USUAL SAID KNIGHT SMILINGLY
2628-109663-0011 THEY HAVE THREE WITNESSES WHO SAW THE SHOOTING AND GAVE A DESCRIPTION OF ME THE CASE HAS BEEN PLACED IN THE HANDS OF SHAMROCK JOLNES THE FAMOUS DETECTIVE
2628-109663-0012 I WAITED AT MY ADDRESS UNTIL TWO THINKING HE MIGHT CALL THERE I LAUGHED TAUNTINGLY
2628-109663-0013 I HAD A BETTER OPINION OF YOUR SHREWDNESS KNIGHT DURING THE THREE HOURS AND A HALF THAT YOU WAITED HE HAS GOT OUT OF YOUR KEN HE IS AFTER YOU ON TRUE INDUCTION THEORIES NOW
2628-109663-0014 I WILL UNDERTAKE TO BREAK THAT RECORD TO MORROW I WILL TAKE YOU TO SHAMROCK JOLNES I WILL UNMASK HIM BEFORE YOU AND PROVE TO YOU THAT IT IS NOT AN IMPOSSIBILITY FOR AN OFFICER OF THE LAW AND A MANSLAYER TO STAND FACE TO FACE IN YOUR CITY
2628-109663-0015 DO IT SAID I AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SINCERE THANKS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ON THE NEXT DAY KNIGHT CALLED FOR ME IN A CAB I'VE BEEN ON ONE OR TWO FALSE SCENTS DOCTOR HE ADMITTED
2628-109663-0016 I KNOW SOMETHING OF DETECTIVES METHODS AND I FOLLOWED OUT A FEW OF THEM EXPECTING TO FIND JOLNES AT THE OTHER END
2628-109663-0017 THEN AGAIN I LOOKED FOR THE DETECTIVE AT THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
2628-109663-0018 BUT I COULD NOT FIND A TRACE OF HIM NOR WILL YOU I SAID EMPHATICALLY NOT BY ORDINARY METHODS SAID KNIGHT
2628-109663-0019 I MIGHT WALK UP AND DOWN BROADWAY FOR A MONTH WITHOUT SUCCESS BUT YOU HAVE AROUSED MY PRIDE DOCTOR AND IF I FAIL TO SHOW YOU SHAMROCK JOLNES THIS DAY I PROMISE YOU I WILL NEVER KILL OR ROB IN YOUR CITY AGAIN
2628-109663-0020 NONSENSE MAN I REPLIED WHEN OUR BURGLARS WALK INTO OUR HOUSES AND POLITELY DEMAND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF JEWELS AND THEN DINE AND BANG THE PIANO AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE LEAVING
2628-109663-0021 HOW DO YOU A MERE MURDERER EXPECT TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE DETECTIVE THAT IS LOOKING FOR YOU AVERY KNIGHT SAT LOST IN THOUGHT FOR A WHILE AT LENGTH HE LOOKED UP BRIGHTLY DOC SAID HE I HAVE IT
2628-109663-0022 BUT THE VEHICLE SET OUT AT A SMART PACE UP BROADWAY TURNING PRESENTLY INTO FIFTH AVENUE AND PROCEEDING NORTHWARD AGAIN
2628-109663-0023 IT WAS WITH A RAPIDLY BEATING HEART THAT I ACCOMPANIED THIS WONDERFUL AND GIFTED ASSASSIN WHOSE ANALYTICAL GENIUS AND SUPERB SELF CONFIDENCE HAD PROMPTED HIM TO MAKE ME THE TREMENDOUS PROMISE OF BRINGING ME INTO THE PRESENCE OF A MURDERER AND THE NEW YORK DETECTIVE IN PURSUIT OF HIM SIMULTANEOUSLY
2628-109663-0024 EVEN YET I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU ARE NOT BEING LED INTO SOME TRAP I ASKED
2628-109663-0025 AND A COUPLE OF DOZEN COPS MY DEAR DOCTOR SAID KNIGHT A LITTLE STIFFLY I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT I AM NO GAMBLER
2628-109663-0026 THE CAB STOPPED BEFORE ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST RESIDENCES ON THE AVENUE WALKING UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN WITH LONG RED WHISKERS WITH A DETECTIVE'S BADGE SHOWING ON THE LAPEL OF HIS COAT
2628-109663-0027 NOW AND THEN THE MAN WOULD REMOVE HIS WHISKERS TO WIPE HIS FACE AND THEN I WOULD RECOGNIZE AT ONCE THE WELL KNOWN FEATURES OF THE GREAT NEW YORK DETECTIVE JOLNES WAS KEEPING A SHARP WATCH UPON THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OF THE HOUSE
2628-109663-0028 WELL DOCTOR SAID KNIGHT UNABLE TO REPRESS A NOTE OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE HAVE YOU SEEN IT IS WONDERFUL WONDERFUL
2628-109663-0029 I COULD NOT HELP EXCLAIMING AS OUR CAB STARTED ON ITS RETURN TRIP BUT HOW DID YOU DO IT BY WHAT PROCESS OF INDUCTION MY DEAR DOCTOR INTERRUPTED THE GREAT MURDERER THE INDUCTIVE THEORY IS WHAT THE DETECTIVES USE MY PROCESS IS MORE MODERN
2628-109663-0030 I CALL IT THE SALTATORIAL THEORY WITHOUT BOTHERING WITH THE TEDIOUS MENTAL PHENOMENA NECESSARY TO THE SOLUTION OF A MYSTERY FROM SLIGHT CLUES I JUMP AT ONCE TO A CONCLUSION I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU THE METHOD I EMPLOYED IN THIS CASE
2628-109663-0031 IN THE FIRST PLACE I ARGUED THAT AS THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN NEW YORK CITY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND UNDER PECULIARLY ATROCIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT AS THE MOST SKILFUL SLEUTH AVAILABLE WAS LET LOOSE UPON THE CASE
2628-109663-0032 THE PERPETRATOR WOULD NEVER BE DISCOVERED DO YOU NOT THINK MY POSTULATION JUSTIFIED BY PRECEDENT
2628-109663-0033 NOW LET ME DESCRIBE MYSELF TO YOU I AM TALL WITH A BLACK BEARD AND I HATE PUBLICITY I HAVE NO MONEY TO SPEAK OF I DO NOT LIKE OATMEAL AND IT IS THE ONE AMBITION OF MY LIFE TO DIE RICH
2628-109663-0034 I AM OF A COLD AND HEARTLESS DISPOSITION I DO NOT CARE FOR MY FELLOWMEN AND I NEVER GIVE A CENT TO BEGGARS OR CHARITY NOW MY DEAR DOCTOR THAT IS THE TRUE DESCRIPTION OF MYSELF
2628-109663-0035 YOU LAUGHED AT ME BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT DETECTIVES AND MURDERERS NEVER MET IN NEW YORK I HAVE DEMONSTRATED TO YOU THAT THE THEORY IS POSSIBLE BUT HOW DID YOU DO IT I ASKED AGAIN
2628-109663-0036 THEREFORE HE MUST NECESSARILY SET TO WORK AND TRAIL A SHORT MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD WHO LIKES TO BE IN THE PAPERS WHO IS VERY WEALTHY IS FOND OF OATMEAL WANTS TO DIE POOR
2628-109663-0037 AND IS OF AN EXTREMELY GENEROUS AND PHILANTHROPIC DISPOSITION WHEN THUS FAR IS REACHED THE MIND HESITATES NO LONGER I CONVEYED YOU AT ONCE TO THE SPOT WHERE SHAMROCK JOLNES WAS PIPING OFF ANDREW CARNEGIE'S RESIDENCE
