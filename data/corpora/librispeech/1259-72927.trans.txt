1259-72927-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN CONCERNING POLITICS SAID I HOW DO YOU MANAGE WITH POLITICS SAID HAMMOND SMILING I AM GLAD THAT IT IS OF ME THAT YOU ASK THAT QUESTION
1259-72927-0001 I DO BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY ELSE WOULD MAKE YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR TRY TO DO SO TILL YOU WERE SICKENED OF ASKING QUESTIONS INDEED I BELIEVE I AM THE ONLY MAN IN ENGLAND WHO WOULD KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN AND SINCE I KNOW
1259-72927-0002 I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BRIEFLY BY SAYING THAT WE ARE VERY WELL OFF AS TO POLITICS BECAUSE WE HAVE NONE IF EVER YOU MAKE A BOOK OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION PUT THIS IN A CHAPTER BY ITSELF AFTER THE MODEL OF OLD HORREBOW'S SNAKES IN ICELAND
1259-72927-0003 I WILL SAID I CHAPTER FOURTEEN HOW MATTERS ARE MANAGED SAID I HOW ABOUT YOUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN NATIONS
1259-72927-0004 I WILL NOT AFFECT NOT TO KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID HE BUT I WILL TELL YOU AT ONCE THAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF RIVAL AND CONTENDING NATIONS WHICH PLAYED SO GREAT A PART IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD OF CIVILISATION HAS DISAPPEARED ALONG WITH THE INEQUALITY BETWIXT MAN AND MAN IN SOCIETY
1259-72927-0005 DOES NOT THAT MAKE THE WORLD DULLER SAID I WHY SAID THE OLD MAN THE OBLITERATION OF NATIONAL VARIETY SAID I NONSENSE HE SAID SOMEWHAT SNAPPISHLY CROSS THE WATER AND SEE
1259-72927-0006 HOW SHOULD IT ADD TO THE VARIETY OR DISPEL THE DULNESS TO COERCE CERTAIN FAMILIES OR TRIBES OFTEN HETEROGENEOUS AND JARRING WITH ONE ANOTHER INTO CERTAIN ARTIFICIAL AND MECHANICAL GROUPS AND CALL THEM NATIONS AND STIMULATE THEIR PATRIOTISM
1259-72927-0007 SAID I THAT'S RIGHT SAID HAMMOND CHEERILY YOU CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND THAT NOW WE ARE FREED FROM THIS FOLLY IT IS OBVIOUS TO US THAT BY MEANS OF THIS VERY DIVERSITY THE DIFFERENT STRAINS OF BLOOD IN THE WORLD CAN BE SERVICEABLE AND PLEASANT TO EACH OTHER
1259-72927-0008 WITHOUT IN THE LEAST WANTING TO ROB EACH OTHER WE ARE ALL BENT ON THE SAME ENTERPRISE MAKING THE MOST OF OUR LIVES AND I MUST TELL YOU WHATEVER QUARRELS OR MISUNDERSTANDINGS ARISE
1259-72927-0009 NO NOT AT ALL SAID HE SOMEWHAT SNAPPISHLY BUT I DO SAY THAT DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ABOUT REAL SOLID THINGS NEED NOT AND WITH US DO NOT CRYSTALLISE PEOPLE INTO PARTIES PERMANENTLY HOSTILE TO ONE ANOTHER
1259-72927-0010 ISN'T THAT WHAT POLITICS USED TO MEAN
1259-72927-0011 SAID HE I TAKE YOU NEIGHBOUR THEY ONLY PRETENDED TO THIS SERIOUS DIFFERENCE OF OPINION FOR IF IT HAD EXISTED THEY COULD NOT HAVE DEALT TOGETHER IN THE ORDINARY BUSINESS OF LIFE COULDN'T HAVE EATEN TOGETHER BOUGHT AND SOLD TOGETHER GAMBLED TOGETHER CHEATED OTHER PEOPLE TOGETHER
1259-72927-0012 BUT MUST HAVE FOUGHT WHENEVER THEY MET WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE SUITED THEM AT ALL THE GAME OF THE MASTERS OF POLITICS WAS TO CAJOLE OR FORCE THE PUBLIC TO PAY THE EXPENSE OF A LUXURIOUS LIFE AND EXCITING AMUSEMENT FOR A FEW CLIQUES OF AMBITIOUS PERSONS
1259-72927-0013 AND THE PRETENCE OF SERIOUS DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BELIED BY EVERY ACTION OF THEIR LIVES WAS QUITE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THAT WHAT HAS ALL THAT GOT TO DO WITH US SAID I WHY NOTHING I SHOULD HOPE BUT I FEAR
1259-72927-0014 CRIED THE OLD BOY IMPETUOUSLY WHAT HUMAN NATURE THE HUMAN NATURE OF PAUPERS OF SLAVES OF SLAVE HOLDERS OR THE HUMAN NATURE OF WEALTHY FREEMEN WHICH COME TELL ME THAT
1259-72927-0015 AMONGST US OUR DIFFERENCES CONCERN MATTERS OF BUSINESS AND PASSING EVENTS AS TO THEM AND COULD NOT DIVIDE MEN PERMANENTLY AS A RULE THE IMMEDIATE OUTCOME SHOWS WHICH OPINION ON A GIVEN SUBJECT IS THE RIGHT ONE IT IS A MATTER OF FACT NOT OF SPECULATION
1259-72927-0016 FOR INSTANCE IT IS CLEARLY NOT EASY TO KNOCK UP A POLITICAL PARTY ON THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HAYMAKING IN SUCH AND SUCH A COUNTRY SIDE SHALL BEGIN THIS WEEK OR NEXT WHEN ALL MEN AGREE THAT IT MUST AT LATEST BEGIN THE WEEK AFTER NEXT
1259-72927-0017 AND WHEN ANY MAN CAN GO DOWN INTO THE FIELDS HIMSELF AND SEE WHETHER THE SEEDS ARE RIPE ENOUGH FOR THE CUTTING SAID I AND YOU SETTLE THESE DIFFERENCES GREAT AND SMALL BY THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY I SUPPOSE CERTAINLY SAID HE
1259-72927-0018 YOU SEE IN MATTERS WHICH ARE MERELY PERSONAL WHICH DO NOT AFFECT THE WELFARE OF THE COMMUNITY HOW A MAN SHALL DRESS WHAT HE SHALL EAT AND DRINK WHAT HE SHALL WRITE AND READ AND SO FORTH THERE CAN BE NO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AND EVERYBODY DOES AS HE PLEASES
1259-72927-0019 AND THE DOING OR NOT DOING SOMETHING AFFECTS EVERYBODY THE MAJORITY MUST HAVE THEIR WAY UNLESS THE MINORITY WERE TO TAKE UP ARMS AND SHOW BY FORCE THAT THEY WERE THE EFFECTIVE OR REAL MAJORITY WHICH HOWEVER IN A SOCIETY OF MEN WHO ARE FREE AND EQUAL IS LITTLE LIKELY TO HAPPEN
1259-72927-0020 BECAUSE IN SUCH A COMMUNITY THE APPARENT MAJORITY IS THE REAL MAJORITY AND THE OTHERS AS I HAVE HINTED BEFORE
1259-72927-0021 ESPECIALLY AS THEY HAVE HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING FORWARD THEIR SIDE OF THE QUESTION HOW IS THAT MANAGED SAID I WELL SAID HE LET US TAKE ONE OF OUR UNITS OF MANAGEMENT A COMMUNE OR A WARD OR A PARISH
1259-72927-0022 FOR WE HAVE ALL THREE NAMES INDICATING LITTLE REAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM NOW THOUGH TIME WAS THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL IN SUCH A DISTRICT AS YOU WOULD CALL IT SOME NEIGHBOURS THINK THAT SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE OR UNDONE A NEW TOWN HALL BUILT
1259-72927-0023 A CLEARANCE OF INCONVENIENT HOUSES OR SAY A STONE BRIDGE SUBSTITUTED FOR SOME UGLY OLD IRON ONE THERE YOU HAVE UNDOING AND DOING IN ONE WELL AT THE NEXT ORDINARY MEETING OF THE NEIGHBOURS OR MOTE AS WE CALL IT
1259-72927-0024 ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT TONGUE OF THE TIMES BEFORE BUREAUCRACY A NEIGHBOUR PROPOSES THE CHANGE AND OF COURSE IF EVERYBODY AGREES THERE IS AN END OF DISCUSSION EXCEPT ABOUT DETAILS EQUALLY IF NO ONE BACKS THE PROPOSER
1259-72927-0025 THE MATTER DROPS FOR THE TIME BEING A THING NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN AMONGST REASONABLE MEN HOWEVER AS THE PROPOSER IS SURE TO HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH OTHERS BEFORE THE MOTE BUT SUPPOSING THE AFFAIR PROPOSED AND SECONDED IF A FEW OF THE NEIGHBOURS DISAGREE TO IT
1259-72927-0026 IF THEY THINK THAT THE BEASTLY IRON BRIDGE WILL SERVE A LITTLE LONGER AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED WITH BUILDING A NEW ONE JUST THEN THEY DON'T COUNT HEADS THAT TIME BUT PUT OFF THE FORMAL DISCUSSION TO THE NEXT MOTE AND MEANTIME ARGUMENTS PRO AND CON ARE FLYING ABOUT
1259-72927-0027 AND SOME GET PRINTED SO THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHEN THE MOTE COMES TOGETHER AGAIN THERE IS A REGULAR DISCUSSION AND AT LAST A VOTE BY SHOW OF HANDS IF THE DIVISION IS A CLOSE ONE THE QUESTION IS AGAIN PUT OFF FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION
1259-72927-0028 IF THE DIVISION IS A WIDE ONE THE MINORITY ARE ASKED IF THEY WILL YIELD TO THE MORE GENERAL OPINION WHICH THEY OFTEN NAY MOST COMMONLY DO IF THEY REFUSE THE QUESTION IS DEBATED A THIRD TIME WHEN IF THE MINORITY HAS NOT PERCEPTIBLY GROWN THEY
1259-72927-0029 VERY GOOD SAID I BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DIVISIONS ARE STILL NARROW SAID HE AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE AND ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF SUCH CASES THE QUESTION MUST THEN LAPSE AND THE MAJORITY IF SO NARROW
1259-72927-0030 HAS TO SUBMIT TO SITTING DOWN UNDER THE STATUS QUO BUT I MUST TELL YOU THAT IN POINT OF FACT THE MINORITY VERY SELDOM ENFORCES THIS RULE BUT GENERALLY YIELDS IN A FRIENDLY MANNER BUT DO YOU KNOW SAID I THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN ALL THIS VERY LIKE DEMOCRACY
1259-72927-0031 AND I THOUGHT THAT DEMOCRACY WAS CONSIDERED TO BE IN A MORIBUND CONDITION MANY MANY YEARS AGO THE OLD BOY'S EYES TWINKLED I GRANT YOU THAT OUR METHODS HAVE THAT DRAWBACK BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE
1259-72927-0032 WE CAN'T GET ANYONE AMONGST US TO COMPLAIN OF HIS NOT ALWAYS HAVING HIS OWN WAY IN THE TEETH OF THE COMMUNITY WHEN IT IS CLEAR THAT EVERYBODY CANNOT HAVE THAT INDULGENCE WHAT IS TO BE DONE WELL SAID I I DON'T KNOW SAID HE
1259-72927-0033 THE ONLY ALTERNATIVES TO OUR METHOD THAT I CAN CONCEIVE OF ARE THESE FIRST THAT WE SHOULD CHOOSE OUT OR BREED A CLASS OF SUPERIOR PERSONS CAPABLE OF JUDGING ON ALL MATTERS WITHOUT CONSULTING THE NEIGHBOURS
1259-72927-0034 THAT IN SHORT WE SHOULD GET FOR OURSELVES WHAT USED TO BE CALLED AN ARISTOCRACY OF INTELLECT OR SECONDLY THAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE GUARDING THE FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL WILL WE SHOULD REVERT TO A SYSTEM OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AGAIN AND HAVE SLAVES AND SLAVE HOLDERS ONCE MORE
1259-72927-0035 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE TWO EXPEDIENTS WELL SAID I THERE IS A THIRD POSSIBILITY TO WIT THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD BE QUITE INDEPENDENT OF EVERY OTHER AND THAT THUS THE TYRANNY OF SOCIETY SHOULD BE ABOLISHED
1259-72927-0036 AND THEN BURST OUT LAUGHING VERY HEARTILY AND I CONFESS THAT I JOINED HIM WHEN HE RECOVERED HIMSELF HE NODDED AT ME AND SAID YES YES I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU AND SO WE ALL DO YES I SAID
1259-72927-0037 BUT DEAR NEIGHBOUR THAT IS NOT A VERY EFFECTIVE SALVE FOR THE WOUND CAUSED BY THE TYRANNY OF A MAJORITY IN OUR SOCIETY BECAUSE ALL WORK THAT IS DONE IS EITHER BENEFICIAL OR HURTFUL TO EVERY MEMBER OF SOCIETY THE MAN IS BENEFITED BY THE BRIDGE BUILDING IF IT TURNS OUT A GOOD THING
1259-72927-0038 AND HURT BY IT IF IT TURNS OUT A BAD ONE WHETHER HE PUTS A HAND TO IT OR NOT AND MEANWHILE HE IS BENEFITING THE BRIDGE BUILDERS BY HIS WORK WHATEVER THAT MAY BE IN FACT I SEE NO HELP FOR HIM EXCEPT THE PLEASURE OF SAYING I TOLD YOU SO
1259-72927-0039 WHEN FOR EVERY WELL FED CONTENTED PERSON YOU SAW A THOUSAND MISERABLE STARVELINGS WHEREAS FOR US WE GROW FAT AND WELL LIKING ON THE TYRANNY A TYRANNY TO SAY THE TRUTH NOT TO BE MADE VISIBLE BY ANY MICROSCOPE I KNOW DON'T BE AFRAID MY FRIEND
1259-72927-0040 WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEEK FOR TROUBLES BY CALLING OUR PEACE AND PLENTY AND HAPPINESS BY ILL NAMES WHOSE VERY MEANING WE HAVE FORGOTTEN
