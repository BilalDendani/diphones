3816-290923-0000 THERE ARE MANY POINTS WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION IN THE MAKING OF A BALANCE STAFF THAT ARE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED I HAVE SEEN STAFFS THAT WERE MODELS AS REGARDS EXECUTION AND FINISH THAT WERE NEARLY WORTHLESS FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT
3816-290923-0001 ON THE OTHER HAND ONE OFTEN SEES STAFFS WHOSE PIVOTS ARE FAULTLESS IN SHAPE BUT THE EXECUTION AND FINISH SO BUNGLING AS TO OFFSET ALL THE GOOD QUALITIES AS REGARDS SHAPE
3816-290923-0002 TO HAVE GOOD TOOLS AND THE RIGHT IDEAS IS ONE THING AND TO USE THESE TOOLS PROPERLY AND MAKE A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF YOUR THEORY IS ANOTHER I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO TAKE UP EVERY POINT IN CONNECTION WITH THE BALANCE STAFF
3816-290923-0003 FROM THE STEEL TO THE JEWELS AND THEIR RELATION TO THE PIVOTS AND I BELIEVE THIS WILL THEN CONVEY TO THE READER ALL THE NECESSARY POINTS NOT ONLY AS REGARDS STAFFS BUT PIVOTS ALSO WHETHER APPLIED TO A BALANCE OR A PINION STAFF
3816-290923-0004 THAT TO DAY WITH OUR INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS AND THE CHEAPNESS OF ALL MATERIAL IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO MAKE A BALANCE STAFF TO THE READER WHO TAKES THIS VIEW OF THE SITUATION I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY KINDLY FOLLOW ME TO THE END OF THIS PARAGRAPH
3816-290923-0005 AND IF YOU ARE STILL OF THE SAME OPINION THEN YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME IN FOLLOWING ME FARTHER FOR A MATERIAL DEALER TO ADVANCE THIS THEORY I CAN FIND SOME EXCUSE HE IS AN INTERESTED PARTY AND THE SELLING OF MATERIAL IS HIS BREAD AND BUTTER
3816-290923-0006 OF ONLY ONE OF THE LEADING MANUFACTURERS OF WATCHES IN THIS COUNTRY TO SAY NOTHING OF THE LEGION OF SMALL AND LARGE CONCERNS WHO ARE MANUFACTURING OR HAVE MANUFACTURED IN THE PAST
3816-290923-0007 OR IT IS A NEW MOVEMENT THE MATERIAL FOR WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN PLACED ON THE MARKET THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS LEADS TO MAKESHIFTS AND THEY IN TURN LEAD TO BOTCH WORK
3816-290923-0008 THE WATCHMAKER WHO DOES NOT POSSESS THE EXPERIENCE OR NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS TO MAKE A NEW BALANCE STAFF AND MAKE IT IN A NEAT AND WORKMANLIKE MANNER IS NEVER CERTAIN OF HAVING EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED
3816-290923-0009 AND CANNOT HOPE TO LONG RETAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS CUSTOMERS IN FACT HE IS NOT A WATCHMAKER AT ALL BUT SIMPLY AN APPRENTICE OR STUDENT EVEN THOUGH HE BE WORKING FOR A SALARY OR BE HIS OWN MASTER
3816-290923-0010 THERE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MANY WORTHY MEMBERS OF THE TRADE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE MAKING OF A BALANCE STAFF WHO WILL TAKE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS STATEMENT BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS TRUE
3816-290923-0011 THEY MAY BE PAINSTAKING BUT THEY CANNOT BE CLASSED AS WATCHMAKERS THIS ARTICLE IS INTENDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THAT LARGE CLASS WHOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBTAINING INSTRUCTION ARE LIMITED
3816-290923-0012 AND WHO ARE READY AND WILLING TO LEARN AND FOR THAT STILL LARGER CLASS OF PRACTICAL WORKMEN WHO CAN MAKE A NEW STAFF IN A CREDITABLE MANNER BUT WHO ARE ALWAYS GLAD TO READ OTHERS PEOPLE'S IDEAS ON ANY SUBJECT CONNECTED WITH THE TRADE
3816-290923-0013 I WOULD NOT ADVISE ANY PARTICULAR MAKE OF LATHE AS THE MOST EXPENSIVE LATHE IN THE WORLD WILL NOT PRODUCE A TRUE STAFF IF THE WORKMAN CANNOT CENTER HIS WORK ACCURATELY AND DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HIS GRAVER
3816-290923-0014 WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND FINE WORK CAN BE DONE ON THE SIMPLEST AND CHEAPEST LATHE BY A WORKMAN POSSESSING THE REQUISITE SKILL I WILL TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT YOU USE AN AMERICAN MADE LATHE OF SOME KIND
3816-290923-0015 OR A FOREIGN MADE LATHE MANUFACTURED ON AMERICAN LINES IT IS ADVISABLE THOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO HAVE THREE GRAVERS
3816-290923-0016 B FOR THE CONICAL PIVOTS AND SQUARE SHOULDERS AND C FOR THE UNDER CUTTING THE OTHER TOOLS AND ATTACHMENTS NEEDED WILL BE DESCRIBED AS I COME TO THEM IN USE THE BALANCE STAFF SHOULD BE MADE OF THE BEST STEEL
3816-290923-0017 TEMPERED TO SUCH A DEGREE AS TO GIVE THE LONGEST SERVICE AND YET NOT SO HARD AS TO ENDANGER THE BREAKAGE OF THE PIVOTS SELECT A PIECE OF STUBB'S STEEL WIRE
3816-290923-0018 THE CHUCK HOLDS THE WORK TRUEST THAT COMES THE NEAREST TO FITTING IT IF YOU TRY TO USE A CHUCK THAT IS TOO LARGE OR TOO SMALL FOR THE WORK YOU WILL ONLY RUIN THE CHUCK FOR TRUTH
3816-290923-0019 LEAVING ON A SMALL PART OF THE ORIGINAL WIRE AS SHOWN AT A AFTER THE WIRE IS ROUGHED OUT TO THIS GENERAL FORM REMOVE FROM THE CHUCK AND GET READY TO HARDEN AND TEMPER IT THE HARDENING AND TEMPERING MAY BE EFFECTED IN VARIOUS WAYS
3816-290923-0020 AND I AM SCARCELY PREPARED TO SAY WHICH METHOD IS THE BEST AS THERE ARE SEVERAL WHICH GIVE ABOUT THE SAME GENERAL RESULTS ONE METHOD OF HARDENING IS TO SMEAR THE BLANK WITH COMMON YELLOW SOAP
3816-290923-0021 HEAT IT TO A CHERRY RED AND DROP ENDWISE INTO LINSEED OIL PETROLEUM IS PREFERRED BY SOME TO LINSEED OIL BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH I CAN SEE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE ACTION OF LINSEED PETROLEUM OR OLIVE OIL
3816-290923-0022 BE SURE AND HAVE ENOUGH OIL TO THOROUGHLY COOL THE BLANK AND A DEEP VESSEL SUCH AS A LARGE MOUTHED VIAL IS PREFERABLE TO A SAUCER THE BLANK WILL NOW BE FOUND TOO HARD TO WORK EASILY WITH THE GRAVER
3816-290923-0023 AND WE MUST THEREFORE DRAW THE TEMPER DOWN TO THAT OF FINE SPRING STEEL BEFORE DOING THIS THE BLANK SHOULD BE BRIGHTENED IN ORDER THAT WE MAY SEE TO JUST WHAT COLOR WE ARE DRAWING IT
3816-290923-0024 IF THE HARDENING IS CAREFULLY AND PROPERLY DONE WILL GENERALLY CHIP AND FALL OFF WHEN THE BLANK IS PLUNGED IN THE OIL PARTICULARLY IF THE OIL IS COOL AND IF IT DOES NOT FALL OFF OF ITS OWN ACCORD
3816-290923-0025 IT CAN EASILY BE REMOVED BY ROLLING THE BLANK UPON THE BENCH IF IT DOES NOT COME OUT CLEAN OR IF SOAP IS NOT USED IT MAY BE BRIGHTENED BY AGAIN INSERTING IN THE LATHE
3816-290923-0026 PLACE SOME FINE BRASS FILINGS IN A BOILING OUT CUP OR BLUING PAN AND LAY THE BLANK UPON THESE FILINGS HOLDING THE PAN OVER THE FLAME OF AN ALCOHOL LAMP UNTIL THE BLANK ASSUMES A DARK PURPLE COLOR
3816-290923-0027 ANOTHER METHOD OF TEMPERING IS TO PLACE THE STAFF ON A PIECE OF SHEET IRON OR COPPER SAY ONE INCH WIDE BY FOUR LONG HAVING PREVIOUSLY BENT IT INTO A SMALL ANGLE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE STAFF
3816-290923-0028 LAY ON IT A PIECE OF YELLOW WAX ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BEAN AND HEAT IT OVER YOUR LAMP UNTIL THE WAX TAKES FIRE AND BURNS BLOW OUT THE FLAME AND ALLOW THE STAFF TO COOL
3816-290923-0029 A JUNCTION WE MAY TERM IT WHERE MANY LINES BRANCH OFF FROM THE MAIN ROAD AT THIS PARTICULAR SPOT IS WHERE AUTHORITIES DIFFER
3816-290923-0030 I BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THE REMAINING WORK UPON A STAFF SHOULD BE EXECUTED WHILE IT IS HELD IN A CEMENT CHUCK ON THE OTHER HAND I HAVE SEEN GOOD WORKMEN WHO TURNED AND FINISHED ALL THE LOWER PART OF A STAFF WHILE IN A SPLIT CHUCK
3816-290923-0031 CUT IT OFF AND TURNED AND FINISHED THE UPPER PART IN A CEMENT CHUCK ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY IS THAT THEY HAD MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUTH OF THEIR CHUCKS THAN I HAVE IN MINE
3816-290923-0032 I HAVE EVEN READ OF WATCHMAKERS WHO MADE THE ENTIRE STAFF IN A SPLIT CHUCK BUT I MUST CONFESS I AM SOMEWHAT CURIOUS TO EXAMINE A STAFF MADE IN THAT WAY
3816-290923-0033 AND MUST HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF EXAMINING IT BEFORE I WILL ADMIT THAT A TRUE STAFF CAN BE SO MADE WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THE WORKMAN HAS A MODERATELY TRUE CHUCK AND THAT HE PREFERS TO TURN AND FINISH ALL THE LOWER PORTIONS IN THIS WAY
