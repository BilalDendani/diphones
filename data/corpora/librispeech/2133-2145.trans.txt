2133-2145-0000 THE EGO AND HIS OWN
2133-2145-0001 THE CAUSE OF MANKIND OF TRUTH OF FREEDOM OF HUMANITY OF JUSTICE FURTHER THE CAUSE OF MY PEOPLE
2133-2145-0002 MY PRINCE MY FATHERLAND FINALLY EVEN THE CAUSE OF MIND AND A THOUSAND OTHER CAUSES ONLY MY CAUSE IS NEVER TO BE MY CONCERN
2133-2145-0003 SHAME ON THE EGOIST WHO THINKS ONLY OF HIMSELF LET US LOOK AND SEE THEN HOW THEY MANAGE THEIR CONCERNS
2133-2145-0004 DEVOTE OURSELVES AND GROW ENTHUSIASTIC YOU HAVE MUCH PROFOUND INFORMATION TO GIVE ABOUT GOD AND HAVE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS SEARCHED THE DEPTHS OF THE GODHEAD
2133-2145-0005 AND LOOKED INTO ITS HEART SO THAT YOU CAN DOUBTLESS TELL US HOW GOD HIMSELF ATTENDS TO GOD'S CAUSE WHICH WE ARE CALLED TO SERVE
2133-2145-0006 AND YOU DO NOT CONCEAL THE LORD'S DOINGS EITHER NOW WHAT IS HIS CAUSE HAS HE AS IS DEMANDED OF US MADE AN ALIEN CAUSE THE CAUSE OF TRUTH
2133-2145-0007 OR LOVE HIS OWN YOU ARE SHOCKED BY THIS MISUNDERSTANDING AND YOU INSTRUCT US THAT GOD'S CAUSE IS INDEED THE CAUSE OF TRUTH AND LOVE BUT THAT THIS CAUSE CANNOT BE CALLED ALIEN TO HIM
2133-2145-0008 BECAUSE GOD IS HIMSELF TRUTH AND LOVE YOU ARE SHOCKED BY THE ASSUMPTION THAT GOD COULD BE LIKE US POOR WORMS IN FURTHERING AN ALIEN CAUSE AS HIS OWN
2133-2145-0009 SHOULD GOD TAKE UP THE CAUSE OF TRUTH IF HE WERE NOT HIMSELF TRUTH HE CARES ONLY FOR HIS CAUSE BUT BECAUSE HE IS ALL IN ALL THEREFORE ALL IS HIS
2133-2145-0010 CAUSE BUT WE WE ARE NOT ALL IN ALL AND OUR CAUSE IS ALTOGETHER LITTLE AND CONTEMPTIBLE
2133-2145-0011 HIGHER CAUSE NOW IT IS CLEAR GOD CARES ONLY FOR WHAT IS HIS BUSIES HIMSELF ONLY WITH HIMSELF THINKS ONLY OF HIMSELF
2133-2145-0012 AND HAS ONLY HIMSELF BEFORE HIS EYES WOE TO ALL THAT IS NOT WELL PLEASING TO HIM HE SERVES NO HIGHER PERSON AND SATISFIES ONLY HIMSELF HIS CAUSE IS A PURELY
2133-2145-0013 EGOISTIC CAUSE HOW IS IT WITH MANKIND WHOSE CAUSE WE ARE TO MAKE OUR OWN IS ITS CAUSE THAT OF ANOTHER AND DOES MANKIND SERVE A HIGHER CAUSE NO
2133-2145-0014 MANKIND LOOKS ONLY AT ITSELF MANKIND WILL PROMOTE THE INTERESTS OF MANKIND ONLY MANKIND IS ITS OWN CAUSE THAT IT MAY DEVELOP
2133-2145-0015 IT CAUSES NATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS TO WEAR THEMSELVES OUT IN ITS SERVICE AND WHEN THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT MANKIND NEEDS IT THROWS THEM ON THE DUNG HEAP OF HISTORY IN GRATITUDE
2133-2145-0016 IS NOT MANKIND'S CAUSE A PURELY EGOISTIC CAUSE
2133-2145-0017 NOT WITH US ONLY WITH ITS GOOD NOT WITH OURS LOOK AT THE REST FOR YOURSELVES DO TRUTH FREEDOM HUMANITY JUSTICE
2133-2145-0018 DESIRE ANYTHING ELSE THAN THAT YOU GROW ENTHUSIASTIC AND SERVE THEM THEY ALL HAVE AN ADMIRABLE TIME OF IT WHEN THEY RECEIVE ZEALOUS HOMAGE JUST OBSERVE THE NATION THAT IS DEFENDED BY DEVOTED PATRIOTS
2133-2145-0019 THE PATRIOTS FALL IN BLOODY BATTLE OR IN THE FIGHT WITH HUNGER AND WANT WHAT DOES THE NATION CARE FOR THAT
2133-2145-0020 THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE DIED FOR THE GREAT CAUSE OF THE NATION AND THE NATION SENDS SOME WORDS OF THANKS AFTER THEM AND HAS THE PROFIT OF IT I CALL THAT A PAYING KIND OF EGOISM
2133-2145-0021 BUT ONLY LOOK AT THAT SULTAN WHO CARES SO LOVINGLY FOR HIS PEOPLE IS HE NOT PURE UNSELFISHNESS ITSELF AND DOES HE NOT HOURLY SACRIFICE HIMSELF FOR HIS PEOPLE OH YES
2133-2145-0022 FOR HIS PEOPLE JUST TRY IT SHOW YOURSELF NOT AS HIS BUT AS YOUR OWN FOR BREAKING AWAY FROM HIS EGOISM YOU WILL TAKE A TRIP TO JAIL
2133-2145-0023 THE SULTAN HAS SET HIS CAUSE ON NOTHING BUT HIMSELF HE IS TO HIMSELF ALL IN ALL HE IS TO HIMSELF THE ONLY ONE AND TOLERATES NOBODY WHO WOULD DARE NOT TO BE ONE OF HIS PEOPLE
2133-2145-0024 I FOR MY PART TAKE A LESSON FROM THEM AND PROPOSE INSTEAD OF FURTHER UNSELFISHLY SERVING THOSE GREAT EGOISTS RATHER TO BE THE EGOIST MYSELF
2133-2145-0025 GOD AND MANKIND HAVE CONCERNED THEMSELVES FOR NOTHING FOR NOTHING BUT THEMSELVES LET ME THEN LIKEWISE CONCERN MYSELF FOR MYSELF
2133-2145-0026 WHO AM EQUALLY WITH GOD THE NOTHING OF ALL OTHERS WHO AM MY ALL
2133-2145-0027 IF MANKIND AS YOU AFFIRM HAVE SUBSTANCE ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES TO BE ALL IN ALL TO THEMSELVES THEN I FEEL THAT I SHALL STILL LESS LACK THAT
2133-2145-0028 AND THAT I SHALL HAVE NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE OF MY EMPTINESS I AM NOTHING IN THE SENSE OF EMPTINESS BUT I AM THE CREATIVE NOTHING
2133-2145-0029 THE NOTHING OUT OF WHICH I MYSELF AS CREATOR CREATE EVERYTHING AWAY THEN WITH EVERY CONCERN THAT IS NOT ALTOGETHER MY CONCERN
2133-2145-0030 YOU THINK AT LEAST THE GOOD CAUSE MUST BE MY CONCERN WHAT'S GOOD WHAT'S BAD WHY I MYSELF AM MY CONCERN AND I AM NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD
2133-2145-0031 THE DIVINE IS GOD'S CONCERN THE HUMAN MAN'S
2133-2145-0032 NOT THE TRUE GOOD JUST FREE ET CETERA BUT SOLELY WHAT IS MINE AND IT IS NOT A GENERAL ONE BUT IS
2133-2145-0033 NOTHING IS MORE TO ME
