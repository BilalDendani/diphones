1241-121106-0027 ALBERT'S ATTACK ON ANDREA HAD PLACED HIM ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
1241-121106-0028 I SHALL RESIGN THE CASE TO THE KING'S ATTORNEY YOU MISTAKE SIR SAID MORCERF WITH A GLOOMY SMILE I AM NOT REFERRING IN THE LEAST TO MATRIMONY

1241-121106-0033 I IMAGINE ANY ONE MAY WRITE TO YANINA BUT ONE PERSON ONLY WROTE ONE ONLY YES AND THAT WAS YOU I DOUBTLESS WROTE
1241-121106-0034 IT IS NOT ONLY A RIGHT BUT A DUTY YOU WROTE SIR KNOWING WHAT ANSWER YOU WOULD RECEIVE I INDEED I ASSURE YOU CRIED DANGLARS WITH A CONFIDENCE AND SECURITY PROCEEDING LESS FROM FEAR THAN FROM THE INTEREST HE REALLY FELT FOR THE YOUNG MAN
1241-121106-0035 I WAS SPEAKING OF YOUR FATHER'S PAST HISTORY I SAID THE ORIGIN OF HIS FORTUNE REMAINED OBSCURE THE PERSON TO WHOM I ADDRESSED MY SCRUPLES ASKED ME WHERE YOUR FATHER HAD ACQUIRED HIS PROPERTY I ANSWERED IN GREECE
1241-121106-0036 YOU APPEAR TO ACCUSE THE COUNT WHO IS ABSENT FROM PARIS AT THIS MOMENT AND CANNOT JUSTIFY HIMSELF I ACCUSE NO ONE SIR SAID DANGLARS I RELATE AND I WILL REPEAT BEFORE THE COUNT WHAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU DOES THE COUNT KNOW WHAT ANSWER YOU RECEIVED

1241-121106-0038 WHEN THE DAY AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THIS ANSWER YOUR FATHER CAME BY THE ADVICE OF MONTE CRISTO TO ASK MY DAUGHTER'S HAND FOR YOU I DECIDEDLY REFUSED HIM BUT WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION OR EXPOSURE IN SHORT WHY SHOULD I HAVE ANY MORE TO DO WITH THE AFFAIR
1241-121106-0039 IT NEITHER INCREASED NOR DECREASED MY INCOME ALBERT FELT THE BLOOD MOUNTING TO HIS BROW THERE WAS NO DOUBT UPON THE SUBJECT DANGLARS DEFENDED HIMSELF WITH THE BASENESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE ASSURANCE OF A MAN WHO SPEAKS THE TRUTH AT LEAST IN PART IF NOT WHOLLY
1241-121106-0040 NOT FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE BUT THROUGH FEAR BESIDES WHAT WAS MORCERF SEEKING IT WAS NOT WHETHER DANGLARS OR MONTE CRISTO WAS MORE OR LESS GUILTY IT WAS A MAN WHO WOULD ANSWER FOR THE OFFENCE WHETHER TRIFLING OR SERIOUS IT WAS A MAN WHO WOULD FIGHT
1241-121106-0041 AND IT WAS EVIDENT DANGLARS WOULD NOT FIGHT AND IN ADDITION TO THIS EVERYTHING FORGOTTEN OR UNPERCEIVED BEFORE PRESENTED ITSELF NOW TO HIS RECOLLECTION MONTE CRISTO KNEW EVERYTHING AS HE HAD BOUGHT THE DAUGHTER OF ALI PASHA
1241-121106-0042 AND KNOWING EVERYTHING HE HAD ADVISED DANGLARS TO WRITE TO YANINA THE ANSWER KNOWN HE HAD YIELDED TO ALBERT'S WISH TO BE INTRODUCED TO HAIDEE AND ALLOWED THE CONVERSATION TO TURN ON THE DEATH OF ALI AND HAD NOT OPPOSED HAIDEE'S RECITAL
1241-121106-0043 I MUST ASCERTAIN IF YOUR INSINUATIONS ARE JUST AND AM GOING NOW TO INQUIRE OF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
