110-1-0000 AS ONE OF A COMPANY OF SOME HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN AND WOMEN NOT LABOURING UNDER ANY SUSPICIONS OF LUNACY THAT THE COURT OF CHANCERY THOUGH THE SHINING SUBJECT OF MUCH POPULAR PREJUDICE
110-1-0001 AT WHICH POINT I THOUGHT THE JUDGE'S EYE HAD A CAST IN MY DIRECTION WAS ALMOST IMMACULATE THERE HAD BEEN HE ADMITTED A TRIVIAL BLEMISH OR SO IN ITS RATE OF PROGRESS
110-1-0002 BUT THIS WAS EXAGGERATED AND HAD BEEN ENTIRELY OWING TO THE PARSIMONY OF THE PUBLIC WHICH GUILTY PUBLIC IT APPEARED HAD BEEN UNTIL LATELY BENT IN THE MOST DETERMINED MANNER
110-1-0003 ON BY NO MEANS ENLARGING THE NUMBER OF CHANCERY JUDGES APPOINTED I BELIEVE BY RICHARD THE SECOND BUT ANY OTHER KING WILL DO AS WELL THIS SEEMED TO ME TOO PROFOUND A JOKE TO BE INSERTED IN THE BODY OF THIS BOOK
110-1-0004 OR I SHOULD HAVE RESTORED IT
110-1-0005 WITH ONE OR OTHER OF WHOM I THINK IT MUST HAVE ORIGINATED IN SUCH MOUTHS I MIGHT HAVE COUPLED IT WITH AN APT QUOTATION FROM ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS MY NATURE IS SUBDUED
110-1-0006 TO WHAT IT WORKS IN LIKE THE DYER'S HAND PITY ME THEN AND WISH I WERE RENEWED BUT AS IT IS WHOLESOME THAT THE PARSIMONIOUS PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW
110-1-0007 WHAT HAS BEEN DOING AND STILL IS DOING IN THIS CONNEXION I MENTION HERE THAT EVERYTHING SET FORTH IN THESE PAGES CONCERNING THE COURT OF CHANCERY IS SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE
110-1-0008 THAN WHEN IT WAS BEGUN
110-1-0009 NOT YET DECIDED WHICH WAS COMMENCED BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY AND IN WHICH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SEVENTY THOUSAND POUNDS HAS BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN COSTS IF I WANTED OTHER AUTHORITIES FOR JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE
110-1-0010 I COULD RAIN THEM ON THESE PAGES TO THE SHAME OF A PARSIMONIOUS PUBLIC THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER POINT ON WHICH I OFFER A WORD OF REMARK
110-1-0011 THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT IS CALLED SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION HAS BEEN DENIED SINCE THE DEATH OF MISTER KROOK AND MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER LEWES
110-1-0012 TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY ALL AUTHORITIES PUBLISHED SOME INGENIOUS LETTERS TO ME AT THE TIME WHEN THAT EVENT WAS CHRONICLED ARGUING THAT SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE
110-1-0013 I HAVE NO NEED TO OBSERVE THAT I DO NOT WILFULLY OR NEGLIGENTLY MISLEAD MY READERS AND THAT BEFORE I WROTE THAT DESCRIPTION I TOOK PAINS TO INVESTIGATE THE SUBJECT
110-1-0014 BY GIUSEPPE BIANCHINI A PREBENDARY OF VERONA OTHERWISE DISTINGUISHED IN LETTERS WHO PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF IT AT VERONA IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WHICH HE AFTERWARDS REPUBLISHED AT ROME
110-1-0015 THE APPEARANCES BEYOND ALL RATIONAL DOUBT OBSERVED IN THAT CASE ARE THE APPEARANCES OBSERVED IN MISTER KROOK'S CASE THE NEXT MOST FAMOUS
110-1-0016 SIX YEARS EARLIER AND THE HISTORIAN IN THAT CASE IS LE CAT
110-1-0017 THE SUBJECT WAS A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND WAS IGNORANTLY CONVICTED OF HAVING MURDERED HER BUT ON SOLEMN APPEAL TO A HIGHER COURT HE WAS ACQUITTED BECAUSE IT WAS SHOWN UPON THE EVIDENCE
110-1-0018 OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION IS GIVEN I DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO ADD TO THESE NOTABLE FACTS AND THAT GENERAL REFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES WHICH WILL BE FOUND AT PAGE
110-1-0019 FRENCH ENGLISH AND SCOTCH IN MORE MODERN DAYS CONTENTING MYSELF WITH OBSERVING THAT I SHALL NOT ABANDON THE FACTS UNTIL THERE SHALL HAVE BEEN A CONSIDERABLE SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION OF THE TESTIMONY ON WHICH HUMAN OCCURRENCES

110-1-0033 TO ASSORT WITH THE GROPING AND FLOUNDERING CONDITION WHICH THIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY MOST PESTILENT OF HOARY SINNERS HOLDS THIS DAY IN THE SIGHT OF HEAVEN AND EARTH ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON IF EVER
110-1-0034 THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OUGHT TO BE SITTING HERE AS HERE HE IS WITH A FOGGY GLORY ROUND HIS HEAD SOFTLY FENCED IN WITH CRIMSON CLOTH AND CURTAINS ADDRESSED
110-1-0035 BY A LARGE ADVOCATE WITH GREAT WHISKERS A LITTLE VOICE AND AN INTERMINABLE BRIEF AND OUTWARDLY DIRECTING HIS CONTEMPLATION TO THE LANTERN IN THE ROOF WHERE HE CAN SEE NOTHING BUT FOG
110-1-0036 ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON SOME SCORE OF MEMBERS OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY BAR OUGHT TO BE AS HERE THEY ARE MISTILY ENGAGED IN ONE OF THE TEN THOUSAND STAGES OF AN ENDLESS CAUSE

110-1-0039 OUGHT TO BE AS ARE THEY NOT RANGED IN A LINE IN A LONG MATTED WELL BUT YOU MIGHT LOOK IN VAIN FOR TRUTH AT THE BOTTOM OF IT

110-1-0042 AND BY THE DRAWL LANGUIDLY ECHOING TO THE ROOF FROM THE PADDED DAIS WHERE THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR LOOKS INTO THE LANTERN THAT HAS NO LIGHT IN IT AND WHERE THE ATTENDANT WIGS ARE ALL STUCK IN A FOG BANK
110-1-0043 THIS IS THE COURT OF CHANCERY WHICH HAS ITS DECAYING HOUSES AND ITS BLIGHTED LANDS IN EVERY SHIRE WHICH HAS ITS WORN OUT LUNATIC IN EVERY MADHOUSE AND ITS DEAD IN EVERY CHURCHYARD

110-1-0049 THE SHORT HAND WRITERS THE REPORTERS OF THE COURT AND THE REPORTERS OF THE NEWSPAPERS INVARIABLY DECAMP WITH THE REST OF THE REGULARS WHEN JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE COMES ON THEIR PLACES ARE A BLANK
110-1-0050 STANDING ON A SEAT AT THE SIDE OF THE HALL THE BETTER TO PEER INTO THE CURTAINED SANCTUARY IS A LITTLE MAD OLD WOMAN IN A SQUEEZED BONNET WHO IS ALWAYS IN COURT FROM ITS SITTING TO ITS RISING

110-1-0058 A FEW LAWYERS CLERKS AND OTHERS WHO KNOW THIS SUITOR BY SIGHT LINGER ON THE CHANCE OF HIS FURNISHING SOME FUN AND ENLIVENING THE DISMAL WEATHER A LITTLE JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE DRONES ON
110-1-0059 THIS SCARECROW OF A SUIT HAS IN COURSE OF TIME BECOME SO COMPLICATED THAT NO MAN ALIVE KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS THE PARTIES TO IT UNDERSTAND IT LEAST BUT IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT NO TWO CHANCERY LAWYERS

110-1-0064 JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE HAS PASSED INTO A JOKE
110-1-0065 IT HAS BEEN DEATH TO MANY BUT IT IS A JOKE IN THE PROFESSION EVERY MASTER IN CHANCERY HAS HAD A REFERENCE OUT OF IT EVERY CHANCELLOR WAS IN IT FOR SOMEBODY OR OTHER WHEN HE WAS COUNSEL AT THE BAR
110-1-0066 GOOD THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT IT BY BLUE NOSED BULBOUS SHOED OLD BENCHERS IN SELECT PORT WINE COMMITTEE AFTER DINNER IN HALL
110-1-0067 ARTICLED CLERKS HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF FLESHING THEIR LEGAL WIT UPON IT THE LAST LORD CHANCELLOR HANDLED IT NEATLY
