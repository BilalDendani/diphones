3681-116302-0000 AS THE FLOOD POURING INTO THE VALLEY SWEEPS EVERYTHING BEFORE IT THE PEOPLE RUSHING TO SEEK VENGEANCE FORCED EVERY ONE THEY MET TO JOIN THEM NO EGYPTIAN FROM WHOM DEATH HAD SNATCHED A LOVED ONE FAILED TO FOLLOW THE SWELLING TORRENT
3681-116302-0001 WHICH INCREASED TILL HUNDREDS BECAME THOUSANDS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN FREEDMEN AND SLAVES WINGED BY THE ARDENT LONGING TO BRING DEATH AND DESTRUCTION ON THE HATED HEBREWS DARTED TO THE REMOTE QUARTER WHERE THEY DWELT
3681-116302-0002 HOW THE WORKMAN HAD GRASPED A HATCHET THE HOUSEWIFE AN AXE THEY THEMSELVES SCARCELY KNEW THEY WERE DASHING FORWARD TO DEAL DEATH AND RUIN AND HAD HAD NO OCCASION TO SEARCH FOR WEAPONS THEY HAD BEEN CLOSE AT HAND
3681-116302-0003 THE FIRST TO FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THEIR VENGEANCE MUST BE NUN AN AGED HEBREW RICH IN HERDS LOVED AND ESTEEMED BY MANY AN EGYPTIAN WHOM HE HAD BENEFITTED BUT WHEN HATE AND REVENGE SPEAK GRATITUDE SHRINKS TIMIDLY INTO THE BACKGROUND
3681-116302-0004 USUALLY AT THIS HOUR HERDS OF CATTLE AND FLOCKS OF SHEEP WERE BEING WATERED OR DRIVEN TO PASTURE AND THE GREAT YARD BEFORE HIS HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH CATTLE SERVANTS OF BOTH SEXES CARTS AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS
3681-116302-0005 THE OWNER USUALLY OVERLOOKED THE DEPARTURE OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS AND THE MOB HAD MARKED HIM AND HIS FAMILY FOR THE FIRST VICTIMS OF THEIR FURY THE SWIFTEST OF THE AVENGERS HAD NOW REACHED HIS EXTENSIVE FARM BUILDINGS AMONG THEM HORNECHT
3681-116302-0006 CAPTAIN OF THE ARCHERS BROTHER IN LAW OF THE OLD ASTROLOGER HOUSE AND BARNS WERE BRIGHTLY ILLUMINED BY THE FIRST LIGHT OF THE YOUNG DAY A STALWART SMITH KICKED VIOLENTLY ON THE STOUT DOOR
3681-116302-0007 BUT THE UNBOLTED SIDES YIELDED SO EASILY THAT HE WAS FORCED TO CLING TO THE DOOR POST TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM FALLING OTHERS HORNECHT AMONG THEM PRESSED PAST HIM INTO THE YARD WHAT DID THIS MEAN
3681-116302-0008 THE STALLS CONTAINED A FEW DEAD CATTLE AND SHEEP KILLED BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN CRIPPLED IN SOME WAY WHILE A LAME LAMB
3681-116302-0009 THE CARTS AND WAGONS TOO HAD VANISHED THE LOWING BLEATING THRONG WHICH THE PRIESTS HAD IMAGINED TO BE THE SOULS OF THE DAMNED WAS THE HEBREW HOST DEPARTING BY NIGHT FROM THEIR OLD HOME WITH ALL THEIR FLOCKS UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF MOSES
3681-116302-0010 THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARCHERS DROPPED HIS SWORD AND A SPECTATOR MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE SIGHT WAS A PLEASANT SURPRISE TO HIM BUT HIS NEIGHBOR A CLERK FROM THE KING'S TREASURE HOUSE GAZED AROUND THE EMPTY SPACE WITH THE DISAPPOINTED AIR OF A MAN WHO HAS BEEN DEFRAUDED
3681-116302-0011 THE FLOOD OF SCHEMES AND PASSIONS WHICH HAD SURGED SO HIGH DURING THE NIGHT EBBED UNDER THE CLEAR LIGHT OF DAY EVEN THE SOLDIER'S QUICKLY AWAKENED WRATH HAD LONG SINCE SUBSIDED INTO COMPOSURE
3681-116302-0012 THE POPULACE MIGHT HAVE WREAKED THEIR UTMOST FURY ON THE OTHER HEBREWS BUT NOT UPON NUN WHOSE SON HOSEA HAD BEEN HIS COMRADE IN ARMS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED LEADERS IN THE ARMY AND AN INTIMATE FAMILY FRIEND
3681-116302-0013 HAD HE THOUGHT OF HIM AND FORESEEN THAT HIS FATHER'S DWELLING WOULD BE FIRST ATTACKED HE WOULD NEVER HAVE HEADED THE MOB IN THEIR PURSUIT OF VENGEANCE NAY HE BITTERLY REPENTED HAVING FORGOTTEN THE DELIBERATE JUDGMENT WHICH BEFITTED HIS YEARS
3681-116302-0014 WHILE MANY OF THE THRONG BEGAN TO PLUNDER AND DESTROY NUN'S DESERTED HOME MEN AND WOMEN CAME TO REPORT THAT NOT A SOUL WAS TO BE FOUND IN ANY OF THE NEIGHBORING DWELLINGS OTHERS TOLD OF CATS COWERING ON THE DESERTED HEARTHSTONES
3681-116302-0015 OF SLAUGHTERED CATTLE AND SHATTERED FURNITURE BUT AT LAST THE FURIOUS AVENGERS DRAGGED OUT A HEBREW WITH HIS FAMILY AND A HALF WITTED GREY HAIRED WOMAN FOUND HIDDEN AMONG SOME STRAW THE CRONE
3681-116302-0016 AMID IMBECILE LAUGHTER SAID HER PEOPLE HAD MADE THEMSELVES HOARSE CALLING HER BUT MELIELA WAS TOO WISE TO WALK ON AND ON AS THEY MEANT TO DO BESIDES HER FEET WERE TOO TENDER AND SHE HAD NOT EVEN A PAIR OF SHOES
3681-116302-0017 THE MAN A FRIGHTFULLY UGLY JEW WHOM FEW OF HIS OWN RACE WOULD HAVE PITIED PROTESTED SOMETIMES WITH A HUMILITY AKIN TO FAWNING SOMETIMES WITH THE INSOLENCE WHICH WAS A TRAIT OF HIS CHARACTER THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GOD OF LIES
3681-116302-0018 IN WHOSE NAME THE SEDUCER MOSES HAD LED AWAY HIS PEOPLE TO RUIN HE HIMSELF HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILD HAD ALWAYS BEEN ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE EGYPTIANS INDEED MANY KNEW HIM HE WAS A MONEY LENDER
3681-116302-0019 AND WHEN THE REST OF HIS NATION HAD SET FORTH ON THEIR PILGRIMAGE HE HAD CONCEALED HIMSELF HOPING TO PURSUE HIS DISHONEST CALLING AND SUSTAIN NO LOSS SOME OF HIS DEBTORS HOWEVER WERE AMONG THE INFURIATED POPULACE THOUGH EVEN WITHOUT THEIR PRESENCE
3681-116302-0020 NOBODY KNEW WHO HAD DONE THIS FIRST BLOODY DEED TOO MANY HAD DASHED FORWARD AT ONCE
3681-116302-0021 ALSO FELL VICTIMS TO THE PEOPLE'S THIRST FOR VENGEANCE THOUGH MANY HAD TIME TO ESCAPE AND WHILE STREAMS OF BLOOD WERE FLOWING AXES WERE WIELDED AND WALLS AND DOORS WERE BATTERED DOWN WITH BEAMS AND POSTS TO EFFACE THE ABODES OF THE DETESTED RACE FROM THE EARTH
3681-116302-0022 SO THE HEBREWS DWELLINGS ESCAPED THE FLAMES BUT AS THE SUN MOUNTED HIGHER DENSE CLOUDS OF WHITE DUST SHROUDED THE ABODES THEY HAD FORSAKEN AND WHERE ONLY YESTERDAY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAD POSSESSED HAPPY HOMES AND NUMEROUS HERDS
3681-116302-0023 HAD QUENCHED THEIR THIRST IN FRESH WATERS THE GLOWING SOIL WAS COVERED WITH RUBBISH AND STONE SHATTERED BEAMS AND BROKEN WOODWORK DOGS AND CATS LEFT BEHIND BY THEIR OWNERS WANDERED AMONG THE RUINS AND WERE JOINED BY WOMEN AND CHILDREN
3681-116302-0024 WHO LIVED IN THE BEGGARS HOVELS ON THE EDGE OF THE NECROPOLIS CLOSE BY AND NOW HOLDING THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR MOUTHS SEARCHED AMID THE STIFLING DUST AND RUBBISH FOR ANY HOUSEHOLD UTENSIL OR FOOD WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEFT BY THE FUGITIVES AND OVERLOOKED BY THE MOB
3681-116302-0025 YET A SATISFIED SMILE HOVERED AROUND HIS STERN MOUTH AS HE NOTICED HOW THOROUGHLY THE PEOPLE HAD PERFORMED THEIR WORK HIS OWN PURPOSE IT IS TRUE HAD NOT BEEN FULFILLED THE LEADER OF THE FUGITIVES HAD ESCAPED THEIR VENGEANCE BUT HATE THOUGH NEVER SATED
3681-116302-0026 CAN YET BE GRATIFIED EVEN THE SMALLEST PANGS OF AN ENEMY ARE A SATISFACTION AND THE PRIEST HAD JUST COME FROM THE GRIEVING PHARAOH HE HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN RELEASING HIM ENTIRELY FROM THE BONDS OF THE HEBREW MAGICIAN BUT HE HAD LOOSENED THEM
3681-116302-0027 BLESS ME TOO PHARAOH HAD UTTERED THEM AND THE ENTREATY HAD BEEN ADDRESSED NEITHER TO OLD RUI THE CHIEF PRIEST NOR TO HIMSELF THE ONLY PERSONS WHO COULD POSSESS THE PRIVILEGE OF BLESSING THE MONARCH
3681-116302-0028 NAY BUT TO THE MOST ATROCIOUS WRETCH THAT BREATHED TO THE FOREIGNER THE HEBREW MESU WHOM HE HATED MORE THAN ANY OTHER MAN ON EARTH BLESS ME TOO THE PIOUS ENTREATY WHICH WELLS SO TRUSTINGLY FROM THE HUMAN HEART IN THE HOUR OF ANGUISH
3681-116302-0029 HAD PIERCED HIS SOUL LIKE A DAGGER IT HAD SEEMED AS IF SUCH A PETITION UTTERED BY THE ROYAL LIPS TO SUCH A MAN HAD BROKEN THE CROZIER IN THE HAND OF THE WHOLE BODY OF EGYPTIAN PRIESTS STRIPPED THE PANTHER SKIN FROM THEIR SHOULDERS
3681-116302-0030 AND BRANDED WITH SHAME THE WHOLE PEOPLE WHOM HE LOVED HE KNEW FULL WELL THAT MOSES WAS ONE OF THE WISEST SAGES WHO HAD EVER GRADUATED FROM THE EGYPTIAN SCHOOLS
3681-116302-0031 KNEW THAT PHARAOH WAS COMPLETELY UNDER THE THRALL OF THIS MAN WHO HAD GROWN UP IN THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD AND BEEN A FRIEND OF HIS FATHER RAMESES THE GREAT HE HAD SEEN THE MONARCH PARDON DEEDS COMMITTED BY MOSES WHICH WOULD HAVE COST THE LIFE OF ANY OTHER MORTAL
3681-116302-0032 THOUGH HE WERE THE HIGHEST NOBLE IN THE LAND AND WHAT MUST THE HEBREW BE TO PHARAOH THE SUN GOD INCARNATE ON THE THRONE OF THE WORLD WHEN STANDING BY THE DEATH BED OF HIS OWN SON HE COULD YIELD TO THE IMPULSE TO UPLIFT HIS HANDS TO HIM AND CRY
3681-116302-0033 BLESS ME TOO HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF ALL THESE THINGS MATURELY CONSIDERED THEM YET HE WOULD NOT YIELD TO THE MIGHT OF THE STRANGERS THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS MAN AND ALL HIS RACE WAS IN HIS EYES THE HOLIEST MOST URGENT DUTY
3681-116302-0034 TO ACCOMPLISH WHICH HE WOULD NOT SHRINK EVEN FROM ASSAILING THE THRONE NAY IN HIS EYES PHARAOH MENEPHTAH'S SHAMEFUL ENTREATY BLESS ME TOO HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF ALL THE RIGHTS OF SOVEREIGNTY
3681-116302-0035 MOSES HAD MURDERED PHARAOH'S FIRST BORN SON BUT HE AND THE AGED CHIEF PRIEST OF AMON HELD THE WEAL OR WOE OF THE DEAD PRINCE'S SOUL IN THEIR HANDS A WEAPON SHARP AND STRONG FOR HE KNEW THE MONARCH'S WEAK AND VACILLATING HEART
3681-116302-0036 IF THE HIGH PRIEST OF AMON THE ONLY MAN WHOSE AUTHORITY SURPASSED HIS OWN DID NOT THWART HIM BY SOME OF THE UNACCOUNTABLE WHIMS OF AGE IT WOULD BE THE MEREST TRIFLE TO FORCE PHARAOH TO YIELD
3681-116302-0037 BUT ANY CONCESSION MADE TO DAY WOULD BE WITHDRAWN TO MORROW SHOULD THE HEBREW SUCCEED IN COMING BETWEEN THE IRRESOLUTE MONARCH AND HIS EGYPTIAN ADVISERS THIS VERY DAY THE UNWORTHY SON OF THE GREAT RAMESES HAD COVERED HIS FACE AND TREMBLED LIKE A TIMID FAWN
3681-116302-0038 AT THE BARE MENTION OF THE SORCERER'S NAME AND TO MORROW HE MIGHT CURSE HIM AND PRONOUNCE A DEATH SENTENCE UPON HIM PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE INDUCED TO DO THIS AND ON THE FOLLOWING ONE HE WOULD RECALL HIM AND AGAIN SUE FOR HIS BLESSING
