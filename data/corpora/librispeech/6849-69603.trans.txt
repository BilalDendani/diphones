6849-69603-0000 SIR WILFRID WALKING SOUTHWARD FROM THE MARBLE ARCH TO HIS LUNCHEON WITH LADY HENRY WAS GLADLY CONSCIOUS OF THE WARMTH OF HIS FUR COLLARED COAT THOUGH NONE THE LESS READY TO ENVY CARELESS YOUTH AS IT CROSSED HIS PATH NOW AND THEN GREAT COATLESS AND RUDDY
6849-69603-0001 COURTING THE KEEN AIR JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE HIS EXIT TOWARDS MOUNT STREET HE BECAME AWARE OF TWO PERSONS WALKING SOUTHWARD LIKE HIMSELF BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROADWAY HE SOON IDENTIFIED CAPTAIN WARKWORTH
6849-69603-0002 AND THE LADY THERE ALSO WITH THE HELP OF HIS GLASSES HE WAS SOON INFORMED HER TRIM BLACK HAT AND HER BLACK CLOTH COSTUME SEEMED TO HIM TO HAVE A BECOMING AND FASHIONABLE SIMPLICITY AND SHE MOVED IN MORNING DRESS WITH THE SAME EASE AND FREEDOM
6849-69603-0003 THAT HAD DISTINGUISHED HER IN LADY HENRY'S DRAWING ROOM THE NIGHT BEFORE HE ASKED HIMSELF WHETHER HE SHOULD INTERRUPT MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON WITH A VIEW TO ESCORTING HER TO BRUTON STREET HE UNDERSTOOD INDEED
6849-69603-0004 THAT HE AND LADY HENRY WERE TO BE ALONE AT LUNCHEON MADEMOISELLE JULIE HAD NO DOUBT HER OWN QUARTERS AND ATTENDANTS BUT SHE SEEMED TO BE ON HER WAY HOME AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME
6849-69603-0005 PERHAPS EXPLORATORY CONVERSATION WITH HER BEFORE HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH LADY HENRY SEEMED TO HIM NOT UNDESIRABLE BUT HE QUICKLY DECIDED TO WALK ON MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON AND CAPTAIN WARKWORTH PAUSED IN THEIR WALK
6849-69603-0006 ABOUT NO DOUBT TO SAY GOOD BYE BUT VERY CLEARLY LOATH TO SAY IT THEY WERE INDEED IN EARNEST CONVERSATION THE CAPTAIN SPOKE WITH EAGERNESS MADEMOISELLE JULIE WITH DOWNCAST EYES SMILED AND LISTENED
6849-69603-0007 IS THE FELLOW MAKING LOVE TO HER THOUGHT THE OLD MAN IN SOME ASTONISHMENT AS HE TURNED AWAY
6849-69603-0008 HE VAGUELY THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD BOTH SOUND AND WARN LADY HENRY WARN HER OF WHAT
6849-69603-0009 JUST CLOSED BUT HOW WAS HE TO HAND THAT SORT OF THING ON TO LADY HENRY
6849-69603-0010 NO DOUBT MADEMOISELLE JULIE WAS ON HER EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS YET
6849-69603-0011 OF MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON'S PARENTAGE AT ANY RATE ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT HE HAD HIS THOUGHTS BEGAN TO OCCUPY THEMSELVES WITH THE STORY TO WHICH HIS GUESS POINTED SOME THIRTY YEARS BEFORE HE HAD KNOWN BOTH IN LONDON AND IN ITALY
6849-69603-0012 A CERTAIN COLONEL DELANEY AND HIS WIFE ONCE LADY ROSE CHANTREY THE FAVORITE DAUGHTER OF LORD LACKINGTON THEY WERE NOT A HAPPY COUPLE SHE WAS A WOMAN OF GREAT INTELLIGENCE BUT ENDOWED WITH ONE OF THOSE NATURES SENSITIVE PLASTIC
6849-69603-0013 EAGER TO SEARCH OUT AND TO CHALLENGE LIFE WHICH BRING THEIR POSSESSORS SOME GREAT JOYS HARDLY TO BE BALANCED AGAINST A FINAL SUM OF PAIN HER HUSBAND ABSORBED IN HIS MILITARY LIFE
6849-69603-0014 THAT SEEMED TO CARRY WITH IT INNUMERABLE SHALTS AND SHALT NOTS DISAGREEABLE TO THE NATURAL MAN OR WOMAN SOON FOUND HER A TIRING AND TRYING COMPANION SHE ASKED HIM FOR WHAT HE COULD NOT GIVE
6849-69603-0015 THE PERSONS SHE MADE FRIENDS WITH WERE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND WITHOUT COMPLAINING HE SOON GREW TO THINK IT INTOLERABLE
6849-69603-0016 AND AMBITIONS THOUGH WHEN SHE PRETENDED TO CARE FOR THEM SHE ANNOYED HIM IF POSSIBLE STILL MORE AS FOR LADY ROSE SHE WENT THROUGH ALL THE FAMILIAR EMOTIONS OF THE FEMME INCOMPRISE AND WITH THE FAMILIAR RESULT
6849-69603-0017 THERE PRESENTLY APPEARED IN THE HOUSE A MAN OF GOOD FAMILY THIRTY FIVE OR SO TRAVELLER PAINTER AND DREAMER WITH FINE LONG DRAWN FEATURES BRONZED BY THE SUN OF THE EAST AND BRINGING WITH HIM THE REPUTATION OF HAVING PLOTTED
6849-69603-0018 AND FOUGHT FOR MOST OF THE LOST CAUSES OF OUR GENERATION INCLUDING SEVERAL WHICH HAD LED HIM INTO CONFLICT WITH BRITISH AUTHORITIES AND BRITISH OFFICIALS TO COLONEL DELANEY HE WAS AN AGITATOR IF NOT A REBEL
6849-69603-0019 AND THE CARELESS PUNGENCY OF HIS TALK SOON CLASSED HIM AS AN ATHEIST BESIDES IN THE CASE OF LADY ROSE THIS MAN'S FREE AND GENEROUS NATURE HIS INDEPENDENCE OF MONEY AND CONVENTION HIS PASSION FOR THE THINGS OF THE MIND HIS CONTEMPT FOR THE MODE
6849-69603-0020 WHETHER IN DRESS OR POLITICS HIS LIGHT EVASIONS OF THE RED TAPE OF LIFE AS OF SOMETHING THAT NO ONE COULD REASONABLY EXPECT OF A VAGABOND LIKE HIMSELF THESE THINGS PRESENTLY TRANSFORMED A WOMAN IN DESPAIR
6849-69603-0021 SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH AN INTENSITY BEFITTING HER TRUE TEMPERAMENT AND WITH A STUBBORNNESS THAT BORE WITNESS TO THE DREARY FAILURE OF HER MARRIAGE MARRIOTT DALRYMPLE RETURNED HER LOVE AND NOTHING IN HIS VIEW OF LIFE PREDISPOSED HIM
6849-69603-0022 TO PUT WHAT PROBABLY APPEARED TO HIM
6849-69603-0023 THERE WERE NO CHILDREN OF THE DELANEY MARRIAGE AND IN HIS BELIEF THE HUSBAND HAD ENJOYED TOO LONG A COMPANIONSHIP HE HAD NEVER TRULY DESERVED SO LADY ROSE FACED HER HUSBAND TOLD HIM THE TRUTH AND LEFT HIM
6849-69603-0024 SHE AND DALRYMPLE WENT TO LIVE IN BELGIUM IN A SMALL COUNTRY HOUSE SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES FROM BRUSSELS THEY SEVERED THEMSELVES FROM ENGLAND THEY ASKED NOTHING MORE OF ENGLISH LIFE LADY ROSE SUFFERED FROM THE BREACH WITH HER FATHER FOR LORD LACKINGTON NEVER SAW HER AGAIN
6849-69603-0025 WHOSE IMAGE COULD OFTEN ROUSE IN HER A SENSE OF LOSS THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN OCCASIONAL SPELLS OF SILENCE AND TEARS BUT SUBSTANTIALLY SHE NEVER REPENTED WHAT SHE HAD DONE ALTHOUGH COLONEL DELANEY MADE THE PENALTIES OF IT AS HEAVY AS HE COULD
6849-69603-0026 LIKE KARENNINE IN TOLSTOY'S GREAT NOVEL HE REFUSED TO SUE FOR A DIVORCE AND FOR SOMETHING OF THE SAME REASONS DIVORCE WAS IN ITSELF IMPIOUS AND SIN SHOULD NOT BE MADE EASY
6849-69603-0027 HE WAS AT ANY TIME READY TO TAKE BACK HIS WIFE SO FAR AS THE PROTECTION OF HIS NAME AND ROOF WERE CONCERNED SHOULD SHE PENITENTLY RETURN TO HIM SO THE CHILD THAT WAS PRESENTLY BORN TO LADY ROSE COULD NOT BE LEGITIMIZED
6849-69603-0028 SIR WILFRID STOPPED SHORT AT THE PARK END OF BRUTON STREET WITH A START OF MEMORY I SAW IT ONCE I REMEMBER NOW PERFECTLY AND HE WENT ON TO RECALL A BYGONE MOMENT IN THE BRUSSELS GALLERY
6849-69603-0029 WHEN AS HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE GREAT QUINTIN MATSYS HE WAS ACCOSTED WITH SUDDEN CARELESS FAMILIARITY BY A THIN SHABBILY DRESSED MAN IN WHOSE DARK DISTINCTION MADE STILL MORE FANTASTIC AND CONSPICUOUS
6849-69603-0030 BY THE FEVER AND THE EMACIATION OF CONSUMPTION HE RECOGNIZED AT ONCE MARRIOTT DALRYMPLE HE REMEMBERED CERTAIN FRAGMENTS OF THEIR TALK ABOUT THE PICTURES THE EASY MASTERY NOW BRUSQUE NOW POETIC
6849-69603-0031 WITH WHICH DALRYMPLE HAD SHOWN HIM THE TREASURES OF THE GALLERY IN THE MANNER OF ONE WHOSE LEARNING WAS MERELY THE FOOD OF FANCY THE STUFF ON WHICH IMAGINATION AND REVERIE GREW RICH THEN SUDDENLY HIS OWN QUESTION AND LADY ROSE
6849-69603-0032 AND DALRYMPLE'S QUIET VERY WELL SHE'D SEE YOU I THINK IF YOU WANT TO COME
6849-69603-0033 AND AS WHEN A GLEAM SEARCHES OUT SOME BLURRED CORNER OF A LANDSCAPE THERE RETURNED UPON HIM HIS VISIT TO THE PAIR IN THEIR COUNTRY HOME HE RECALLED THE SMALL EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HOUSE THE CHATEAU OF THE VILLAGE BUILT ON THE FRENCH MODEL WITH ITS HIGH MANSARDE ROOF
6849-69603-0034 THE SHABBY STATELINESS OF ITS ARCHITECTURE
6849-69603-0035 AROUND IT THE FLAT RICH FIELDS WITH THEIR THIN LINES OF POPLARS THE SLOW CANALIZED STREAMS THE UNLOVELY FARMS AND COTTAGES THE MIRE OF THE LANES AND SHROUDING ALL
6849-69603-0036 A HOT AUTUMN MIST SWEEPING SLOWLY THROUGH THE DAMP MEADOWS AND BLOTTING ALL CHEERFULNESS FROM THE SUN
6849-69603-0037 SO FULL OF RAGGED EDGES TO AN ENGLISH EYE THE ENGLISH COUPLE WITH THEIR BOOKS THEIR CHILD AND A PAIR OF FLEMISH SERVANTS
6849-69603-0038 WERE THOSE OF POVERTY LADY ROSE'S SMALL FORTUNE INDEED HAD BEEN ALREADY MOSTLY SPENT ON CAUSES OF MANY KINDS IN MANY COUNTRIES SHE AND DALRYMPLE WERE ALMOST VEGETARIANS AND WINE NEVER ENTERED THE HOUSE SAVE FOR THE SERVANTS
6849-69603-0039 WHO SEEMED TO REGARD THEIR EMPLOYERS WITH A REAL BUT HALF CONTEMPTUOUS AFFECTION HE REMEMBERED THE SCANTY ILL COOKED LUNCHEON THE DIFFICULTY IN PROVIDING A FEW EXTRA KNIVES AND FORKS THE WRANGLING WITH THE OLD BONNE HOUSEKEEPER
6849-69603-0040 WHICH WAS NECESSARY BEFORE SERVIETTES COULD BE PRODUCED AND AFTERWARDS THE LIBRARY WITH ITS DEAL SHELVES FROM FLOOR TO CEILING PUT UP BY DALRYMPLE HIMSELF ITS BARE POLISHED FLOOR DALRYMPLE'S TABLE AND CHAIR ON ONE SIDE OF THE OPEN HEARTH
6849-69603-0041 WHICH REPRESENTED HIS FAVORITE HOBBY ON HERS THE SOCIALIST AND ECONOMICAL BOOKS THEY BOTH STUDIED AND THE ENGLISH OR FRENCH POETS THEY BOTH LOVED THE WALLS HUNG WITH THE FADED DAMASK OF A PAST GENERATION WERE DECORATED WITH A STRANGE CROP OF PICTURES
6849-69603-0042 PINNED CARELESSLY INTO THE SILK
6849-69603-0043 PORTRAITS OF MODERN MEN AND WOMEN REPRESENTING ALL POSSIBLE REVOLT AGAINST AUTHORITY POLITICAL RELIGIOUS EVEN SCIENTIFIC THE EVERLASTING NO OF AN UNTIRING AND UBIQUITOUS DISSENT FINALLY IN THE CENTRE OF THE POLISHED FLOOR
6849-69603-0044 THE STRANGE CHILD WHOM LADY ROSE HAD GONE TO FETCH AFTER LUNCH WITH ITS HIGH CREST OF BLACK HAIR ITS LARGE JEALOUS EYES ITS ELFIN HANDS
6849-69603-0045 POOR LADY ROSE HE REMEMBERED HER AS HE AND SHE PARTED AT THE GATE OF THE NEGLECTED GARDEN THE ANGUISH IN HER EYES AS THEY TURNED TO LOOK AFTER THE BENT AND SHRUNKEN FIGURE OF DALRYMPLE CARRYING THE CHILD BACK TO THE HOUSE
6849-69603-0046 THAT'LL SET HIM RIGHT AND THEN BARELY A YEAR LATER THE LINE IN A LONDON NEWSPAPER WHICH HAD REACHED HIM AT MADRID CHRONICLING THE DEATH OF MARRIOTT DALRYMPLE AS OF A MAN ONCE ON THE THRESHOLD OF FAME
6849-69603-0047 BUT LONG SINCE EXILED FROM THE THOUGHTS OF PRACTICAL MEN LADY ROSE TOO WAS DEAD MANY YEARS SINCE SO MUCH HE KNEW BUT HOW AND WHERE
6849-69603-0048 THE CENTRE AND APPARENTLY THE CHIEF ATTRACTION OF LADY HENRY'S ONCE FAMOUS SALON AND BY JOVE SEVERAL OF HER KINSFOLK THERE RELATIONS OF THE MOTHER OR THE FATHER IF WHAT I SUPPOSE IS TRUE THOUGHT SIR WILFRID REMEMBERING ONE OR TWO OF THE GUESTS
6849-69603-0049 WERE THEY WAS SHE AWARE OF IT
6849-69603-0050 AND WAS SOON ON LADY HENRY'S DOORSTEP HER LADYSHIP IS IN THE DINING ROOM SAID THE BUTLER AND SIR WILFRID WAS USHERED THERE STRAIGHT GOOD MORNING WILFRID SAID THE OLD LADY RAISING HERSELF ON HER SILVER HEADED STICKS AS HE ENTERED

6849-69603-0053 LORD RUSSELL LORD PALMERSTON SUGGESTED SIR WILFRID ATTACKING HIS OWN LUNCH MEANWHILE WITH UNABASHED VIGOR

6849-69603-0057 LADY HENRY LAUGHED OH MY TEMPER WILL BE BETTER PRESENTLY WHEN THOSE MEN ARE GONE SHE NODDED TOWARDS THE BUTLER AND FOOTMAN IN THE DISTANCE AND I CAN HAVE MY SAY SIR WILFRID HURRIED HIS MEAL AS MUCH AS LADY HENRY
6849-69603-0058 SHE MEANWHILE TALKED POLITICS AND GOSSIP TO HIM WITH HER OLD CAUSTIC FORCE NIBBLING A DRY BISCUIT AT INTERVALS AND SIPPING A CUP OF COFFEE SHE WAS A WILFUL CHARACTERISTIC FIGURE AS SHE SAT THERE BENEATH HER OWN PORTRAIT AS A BRIDE
6849-69603-0059 WHICH HUNG ON THE WALL BEHIND HER THE PORTRAIT REPRESENTED A VERY YOUNG WOMAN WITH PLENTIFUL BROWN HAIR GATHERED INTO A KNOT ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD A HIGH WAIST A BLUE WAIST RIBBON AND INFLATED SLEEVES HANDSOME IMPERIOUS
6849-69603-0060 THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH WELL DOWN THE LOOK STRAIGHT AND DARING THE LADY HENRY OF THE PICTURE A BRIDE OF NINETEEN WAS ALREADY FORMIDABLE AND THE OLD WOMAN SITTING BENEATH IT WITH THE STRONG WHITE HAIR WHICH
6849-69603-0061 THE AMPLE CAP FOUND SOME DIFFICULTY EVEN NOW IN TAMING AND CONFINING THE DROOP OF THE MOUTH ACCENTUATED THE NOSE MORE MASTERFUL THE DOUBLE CHIN GROWN EVIDENT THE LIGHT OF THE EYES GONE OUT BREATHED PRIDE
6849-69603-0062 AND WILL FROM EVERY FEATURE OF HER STILL HANDSOME FACE PRIDE OF RACE AND PRIDE OF INTELLECT COMBINED WITH A HUNDRED OTHER SUBTLER AND SMALLER PRIDES THAT ONLY AN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF HER COULD DETECT
6849-69603-0063 THE BROW AND EYES SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PICTURE WERE HOWEVER STILL AGREEABLE IN THE LIVING WOMAN IF GENEROSITY LINGERED ANYWHERE IT WAS IN THEM THE DOOR WAS HARDLY CLOSED UPON THE SERVANTS
6849-69603-0064 THEN THE STRANGE FEELING I HAD THAT I HAD SEEN THE FACE OR SOME FACE JUST LIKE IT BEFORE AND LASTLY AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE I CAUGHT SIGHT FOR A MOMENT OF LORD LACKINGTON THAT FINISHED IT AH SAID LADY HENRY WITH A NOD

6849-69603-0067 WHOEVER COMES HANDY AND NEVER HAS AN INKLING AN IDEA
6849-69603-0068 AND LADY HENRY PUSHED AWAY HER COFFEE CUP WITH THE ILL SUPPRESSED VEHEMENCE WHICH ANY MENTION OF HER COMPANION SEEMED TO PRODUCE IN HER WELL NOW I SUPPOSE YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR THE STORY WAIT A MINUTE
6849-69603-0069 IT'LL SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR THAT I NOT ONLY KNEW THIS LADY'S MOTHER AND FATHER BUT THAT I'VE SEEN HER HERSELF BEFORE
6849-69603-0070 LADY HENRY LOOKED INCREDULOUS
6849-69603-0071 FOUR AND TWENTY YEARS AGO NEVER THAT I REMEMBER
6849-69603-0072 I MYSELF ONLY SAW LADY ROSE ONCE SO FAR AS I REMEMBER BEFORE SHE MISCONDUCTED HERSELF AND AFTERWARDS WELL ONE DOESN'T TROUBLE ONE'S SELF ABOUT THE WOMEN THAT HAVE GONE UNDER SOMETHING LIGHTENED BEHIND SIR WILFRID'S STRAW COLORED LASHES HE BENT OVER HIS COFFEE CUP
6849-69603-0073 FINGER THE WOMEN WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PULL UP LADY HENRY PAUSED
6849-69603-0074 SHE SAID AT LAST SIR WILFRID DID NOT RAISE HIS EYES LADY HENRY TOOK UP HER STRONGEST GLASSES FROM THE TABLE AND PUT THEM ON BUT IT WAS PITIFULLY EVIDENT THAT EVEN SO EQUIPPED SHE SAW BUT LITTLE
6849-69603-0075 NEVERTHELESS SOME UNSPOKEN COMMUNICATION PASSED BETWEEN THEM AND SIR WILFRID KNEW THAT HE HAD EFFECTUALLY HELD UP A PROTECTING HAND FOR LADY ROSE
6849-69603-0076 AND GAVE THE LITTLE REMINISCENCE IN FULL WHEN HE DESCRIBED THE CHILD LADY HENRY LISTENED EAGERLY
6849-69603-0077 SHE WAS JEALOUS YOU SAY OF HER MOTHER'S ATTENTIONS TO YOU SHE WATCHED YOU AND IN THE END SHE TOOK POSSESSION OF YOU MUCH THE SAME CREATURE APPARENTLY THEN AS NOW NO MORAL PLEASE TILL THE TALE IS DONE
6849-69603-0078 THAT TIME SHE PASSED IN GREAT POVERTY IN SOME CHAMBRES GARNIES AT BRUGES WITH HER LITTLE GIRL AND AN OLD MADAME LE BRETON THE MAID HOUSEKEEPER AND GENERAL FACTOTUM WHO HAD SERVED THEM IN THE COUNTRY THIS WOMAN
6849-69603-0079 THOUGH OF A PEEVISH GRUMBLING TEMPER WAS FAITHFUL AFFECTIONATE AND NOT WITHOUT EDUCATION SHE WAS CERTAINLY ATTACHED TO LITTLE JULIE WHOSE NURSE SHE HAD BEEN DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF HER INFANCY IT WAS NATURAL THAT LADY ROSE SHOULD LEAVE THE CHILD TO HER CARE
6849-69603-0080 INDEED SHE HAD NO CHOICE AN OLD URSULINE NUN AND A KIND PRIEST
6849-69603-0081 BIDDING HIM GOOD BYE AND ASKING HIM TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE CHILD SHE IS WONDERFULLY LIKE YOU SO RAN PART OF THE LETTER YOU WON'T EVER ACKNOWLEDGE HER I KNOW THAT IS YOUR STRANGE CODE

6849-69603-0083 TO THIS LETTER LORD LACKINGTON REPLIED PROMISING TO COME OVER AND SEE HIS DAUGHTER BUT AN ATTACK OF GOUT DELAYED HIM AND BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF HIS ROOM LADY ROSE WAS DEAD THEN HE NO LONGER TALKED OF COMING OVER
6849-69603-0084 AND HIS SOLICITORS ARRANGED MATTERS
6849-69603-0085 THROUGH THE HONEST LAWYER WHOM LADY ROSE HAD FOUND FOR THE BENEFIT OF JULIE DALRYMPLE THE CAPITAL VALUE TO BE HANDED OVER TO THAT YOUNG LADY HERSELF ON THE ATTAINMENT OF HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY ALWAYS PROVIDED THAT NEITHER SHE NOR ANYBODY ON HER BEHALF
6849-69603-0086 MADE ANY FURTHER CLAIM ON THE LACKINGTON FAMILY THAT HER RELATIONSHIP TO THEM WAS DROPPED AND HER MOTHER'S HISTORY BURIED IN OBLIVION ACCORDINGLY THE GIRL GREW TO MATURITY IN BRUGES BY THE LAWYER'S ADVICE AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH
6849-69603-0087 SHE TOOK THE NAME OF HER OLD GOUVERNANTE AND WAS KNOWN THENCEFORWARD AS JULIE LE BRETON THE URSULINE NUNS TO WHOSE SCHOOL SHE WAS SENT TOOK THE PRECAUTION AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH
6849-69603-0088 OF HAVING HER BAPTIZED STRAIGHTWAY INTO THE CATHOLIC FAITH AND SHE MADE HER PREMIERE COMMUNION IN THEIR CHURCH IN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS SHE BECAME A REMARKABLE GIRL THE SOURCE OF MANY ANXIETIES TO THE NUNS
6849-69603-0089 FOR SHE WAS NOT ONLY TOO CLEVER FOR THEIR TEACHING AND AN INBORN SCEPTIC BUT WHEREVER SHE APPEARED SHE PRODUCED PARTIES AND THE PASSIONS OF PARTIES AND THOUGH AS SHE GREW OLDER SHE SHOWED MUCH ADROITNESS IN MANAGING THOSE WHO WERE HOSTILE TO HER SHE WAS NEVER WITHOUT ENEMIES
6849-69603-0090 A SHARP AND FEVERISH COLOR HAD SPRUNG UP AS HER STORY APPROACHED THE MOMENT OF HER OWN PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON FOR ONE OR TWO OF THE NUNS WHEN I SAW THEM IN BRUGES BEFORE THE BARGAIN WAS FINALLY STRUCK WERE CANDID ENOUGH HOWEVER
6849-69603-0091 EYES ON HER YOU KNOW MY LITTLE PLACE IN SURREY ABOUT A MILE FROM ME IS A MANOR HOUSE BELONGING TO AN OLD CATHOLIC FAMILY TERRIBLY DEVOUT AND AS POOR AS CHURCH MICE THEY SENT THEIR DAUGHTERS TO SCHOOL IN BRUGES

6849-69603-0093 SIR WILFRID MADE A MURMUR OF SYMPATHY OH DON'T PITY ME I DON'T PITY OTHER PEOPLE
6849-69603-0094 STILL JUST THEN I WAS LOW THERE ARE TWO THINGS I CARE ABOUT ONE IS TALK WITH THE PEOPLE THAT AMUSE ME AND THE OTHER IS THE READING OF FRENCH BOOKS I DIDN'T SEE HOW I WAS GOING TO KEEP MY CIRCLE HERE TOGETHER AND MY OWN MIND IN DECENT REPAIR
6849-69603-0095 UNLESS I COULD FIND SOMEBODY TO BE EYES FOR ME AND TO READ TO ME AND AS I'M A BUNDLE OF NERVES AND I NEVER WAS AGREEABLE TO ILLITERATE PEOPLE NOR THEY TO ME I WAS RATHER PUT TO IT WELL ONE DAY THESE GIRLS AND THEIR MOTHER CAME OVER TO TEA
6849-69603-0096 AND AS YOU GUESS OF COURSE THEY BROUGHT MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON WITH THEM I HAD ASKED THEM TO COME BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED I WAS BORED AND CROSS AND LIKE A SICK DOG IN A HOLE AND THEN AS YOU HAVE SEEN HER I SUPPOSE YOU CAN GUESS WHAT HAPPENED
6849-69603-0097 YOU DISCOVERED AN EXCEPTIONAL PERSON LADY HENRY LAUGHED I WAS LIMED THERE AND THEN OLD BIRD AS I AM I WAS FIRST STRUCK WITH THE GIRL'S APPEARANCE
6849-69603-0098 WITH EVERY MOVEMENT JUST AS IT OUGHT TO BE INFINITELY MORE ATTRACTIVE TO ME THAN ANY PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD JUST BEEN FOR A MONTH IN PARIS WITH ANOTHER SCHOOL FELLOW SOMETHING SHE SAID ABOUT A NEW PLAY SUDDENLY MADE ME LOOK AT HER
6849-69603-0099 PRES DE MOI I SAID TO HER I CAN HEAR MY OWN VOICE NOW POOR FOOL
