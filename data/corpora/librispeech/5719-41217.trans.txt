5719-41217-0000 SOME CENTURIES AT LEAST INQUISITIVE OBSERVERS HERE AND THERE HAVE THOUGHT THEY FOUND REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN PRESENT VARIOUS SIGNS OF A MENSTRUAL PHYSIOLOGICAL CYCLE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO COLLECT A NUMBER OF OPINIONS IN FAVOR OF SUCH A MONTHLY PHYSIOLOGICAL PERIODICITY IN MEN
5719-41217-0001 PRECISE EVIDENCE HOWEVER IS FOR THE MOST PART LACKING MEN HAVE EXPENDED INFINITE INGENUITY IN ESTABLISHING THE REMOTE RHYTHMS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE PERIODICITY OF COMETS
5719-41217-0002 YET THE TASK OF SUMMARIZING THE WHOLE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THESE MYSTERIOUS REVOLUTIONS IS EVEN TO DAY NO HEAVY ONE AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF A MONTHLY CYCLE IN THE SEXUAL INSTINCTS OF MEN WITH A SINGLE EXCEPTION
5719-41217-0003 ALTHOUGH THAT EVIDENCE WILL NOT SUFFICE TO SETTLE THE QUESTION FINALLY THE GREAT ITALIAN PHYSICIAN SANCTORIUS WHO WAS IN SO MANY WAYS THE PRECURSOR OF OUR MODERN METHODS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH BY THE MEANS OF INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION
5719-41217-0004 WAS THE FIRST SO FAR AS I AM AWARE TO SUGGEST A MONTHLY CYCLE OF THE ORGANISM IN MEN HE HAD CAREFULLY STUDIED THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY WITH REFERENCE TO THE AMOUNT OF EXCRETIONS
5719-41217-0005 AND BELIEVED THAT A MONTHLY INCREASE IN WEIGHT TO THE AMOUNT OF ONE OR TWO POUNDS OCCURRED IN MEN FOLLOWED BY A CRITICAL DISCHARGE OF URINE
5719-41217-0006 HE INSISTED THAT THERE IS A MONTHLY CRITICAL PERIOD MORE MARKED IN NERVOUS PEOPLE THAN IN OTHERS AND THAT AT THIS TIME THE COMPLEXION BECOMES DULL THE BREATH STRONGER DIGESTION MORE LABORIOUS WHILE THERE IS SOMETIMES DISTURBANCE OF THE URINE TOGETHER WITH GENERAL MALAISE
5719-41217-0007 IN WHICH THE TEMPER TAKES PART IDEAS ARE FORMED WITH MORE DIFFICULTY AND THERE IS A TENDENCY TO MELANCHOLY WITH UNUSUAL IRASCIBILITY AND MENTAL INERTIA LASTING A FEW DAYS MORE RECENTLY STEPHENSON WHO ESTABLISHED THE CYCLICAL WAVE THEORY OF MENSTRUATION
5719-41217-0008 PUT FORTH THE VIEW A FEW YEARS AGO THAT THERE ARE MENSTRUAL PERIODS IN MEN GIVING THE FOLLOWING REASONS ONE MALES ARE RUDIMENTARY FEMALES TWO IN ALL MALES OF MAMMALS A RUDIMENTARY MASCULINE UTERUS
5719-41217-0009 BUT ALTHOUGH HE HAD WRITTEN A LETTER TO THE LANCET ASKING MEDICAL MEN TO SUPPLY HIM WITH EVIDENCE BEARING ON THIS QUESTION IT CAN SCARCELY BE SAID THAT HE HAS BROUGHT FORWARD MUCH EVIDENCE OF A CONVINCING KIND AND SUCH AS HE HAS BROUGHT FORWARD IS PURELY PATHOLOGICAL
5719-41217-0010 HE BELIEVES HOWEVER THAT WE MAY ACCEPT A MONTHLY CYCLE IN MEN WE MAY HE CONCLUDES REGARD THE HUMAN BEING BOTH MALE AND FEMALE AS THE SUBJECT OF A MONTHLY PULSATION WHICH BEGINS WITH THE BEGINNING OF LIFE AND CONTINUES TILL DEATH
5719-41217-0011 MENSTRUATION BEING REGARDED AS A FUNCTION ACCIDENTALLY INGRAFTED UPON THIS PRIMORDIAL RHYTHM
5719-41217-0012 IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO ARGUE THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS INCREASED IF WE CAN BELIEVE THAT IN WOMEN ALSO THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE PERSISTS EVEN WHEN ITS OUTWARD MANIFESTATIONS NO LONGER OCCUR
5719-41217-0013 IT WAS AN IGNORED OR UNKNOWN FACT OF RECENT YEARS HOWEVER MANY WRITERS ESPECIALLY ALIENISTS HAVE STATED THEIR CONVICTION THAT SEXUAL DESIRE IN MEN TENDS TO BE HEIGHTENED AT APPROXIMATELY MONTHLY INTERVALS THOUGH THEY HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO GIVE DEFINITE EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THEIR STATEMENTS
5719-41217-0014 THE NISUS GENERATIVUS IS GREATLY INCREASED AND HE SAYS THAT IF IN THAT CONDITION HE HAS FULL AND FREE SEMINAL EMISSIONS DURING SLEEP THE EXCITEMENT PASSES OFF IF NOT IT GOES ON
5719-41217-0015 AND A VERY LONG WALK SOMETIMES DOES THE SAME WHEN THE EXCITEMENT GETS TO A HEIGHT IT IS ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY ABOUT A WEEK OF STUPID DEPRESSION IN THE SAME ARTICLE CLOUSTON REMARKS I HAVE FOR A LONG TIME BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE MENTAL AND BODILY ALTERNATIONS
5719-41217-0016 AND PERIODICITIES IN INSANITY TO THE GREAT PHYSIOLOGICAL ALTERNATIONS AND PERIODICITIES AND I HAVE GENERALLY BEEN LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY ARE THE SAME IN ALL ESSENTIAL RESPECTS AND ONLY DIFFER IN DEGREE OF INTENSITY OR DURATION
5719-41217-0017 BY FAR THE MAJORITY OF THE CASES IN WOMEN FOLLOW THE LAW OF THE MENSTRUAL AND SEXUAL PERIODICITY THE MAJORITY OF THE CASES IN MEN FOLLOW THE LAW OF THE MORE IRREGULAR PERIODICITIES OF THE NISUS GENERATIVUS IN THAT SEX
5719-41217-0018 MANY OF THE CASES IN BOTH SEXES FOLLOW THE SEASONAL PERIODICITY WHICH PERHAPS IN MAN IS MERELY A REVERSION TO THE SEASONAL GENERATIVE ACTIVITIES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE LOWER ANIMALS
5719-41217-0019 FORTY SIX PER CENT OF FEMALES AND FORTY PER CENT OF MALES SHOWED PERIODICITY DIURNAL MONTHLY SEASONAL OR ANNUAL AND MORE MARKED IN WOMEN THAN IN MEN AND IN MANIA THAN IN MELANCHOLIA AND ADDS
5719-41217-0020 BUT NEVER BECAME INTENSE
5719-41217-0021 AND WITH SO POWERFUL A RHYTHM ALREADY STAMPED UPON ITS NERVOUS ORGANIZATION TO BE PECULIARLY APT TO DISPLAY A MENSTRUAL RHYTHM UNDER THE STRESS OF ABNORMAL CONDITIONS
5719-41217-0022 I AM ABLE TO PRESENT A CASE IN WHICH SUCH A PERIODICITY SEEMS TO BE INDICATED IT IS THAT OF A GENTLEMAN WHO SUFFERED SEVERELY FOR SOME YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH FROM VALVULAR DISEASE OF THE HEART WITH A TENDENCY TO PULMONARY CONGESTION AND ATTACKS OF CARDIAC ASTHMA
5719-41217-0023 THE PERIODS WERE NOT QUITE REGULAR BUT SHOW A CURIOUS TENDENCY TO RECUR AT ABOUT THIRTY DAYS INTERVAL A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE END OF EVERY MONTH IT WAS DURING ONE OF THESE ATTACKS THAT HE FINALLY DIED
5719-41217-0024 THERE WAS ALSO A TENDENCY TO MINOR ATTACKS ABOUT TEN DAYS AFTER THE MAJOR ATTACKS
