2269-165387-0000 IN THE NEXT APARTMENT INTO WHICH MISTER WISEMAN CONDUCTED US WE SAW THE CUB OF A BEAR WHO LAY UPON THE FLOOR TO WHICH HE WAS CHAINED WITHOUT HAVING THE GOOD MANNERS TO RISE WHEN WE ENTERED
2269-165387-0001 BUT WHEN THE BRAMIN APPLIED HIS WAND TO YOUNG BRUIN'S BUTTOCKS HE HEAVED UP HIS SHAGGY HIDE WITH A KIND OF LAZY RESENTMENT AND SALUTED US WITH A RELUCTANT GRIN AND A SAVAGE GROWL
2269-165387-0002 WHICH PLAINLY INTIMATED THAT HE DID NOT THINK HIMSELF MUCH BEHOLDEN TO US FOR OUR COMPANY THIS YOUNG BRUTE SAID OUR CONDUCTOR IS ANIMATED BY THE SOUL OF THE LATE
2269-165387-0003 OF CLOWNISH MEMORY HIS FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN OF RANK AND FORTUNE AND GREATLY BELOVED AND RESPECTED BY ALL HIS ACQUAINTANCE
2269-165387-0004 YOUNG RUSTICK'S CHARACTER WAS ENTIRELY THE REVERSE OF HIS FATHER'S HE WAS OF AN AWKWARD CLUMSY MAKE AND THE HEAVINESS OF HIS DISPOSITION AND THE COARSENESS OF HIS MANNERS PERFECTLY CORRESPONDED WITH THE SHAPE OF HIS BODY
2269-165387-0005 AND MUCH LONGER BEFORE HE COULD READ WITH TOLERABLE ACCURACY AND EVEN THEN HE PRONOUNCED EVERY THING WITH SUCH A CLOWNISH ACCENT AND SUCH A DRAWLING TONE
2269-165387-0006 AND SO UNMERCIFULLY BLOTTED AND BEDAWBED THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN THE ELEGANT EPISTLE OF TONY CLODHOPPER TO HIS GRANDMOTHER GOODY LINSEY WOOLSEY AS FOR HIS MAMMA POOR GENTLEWOMAN
2269-165387-0007 WHEN SHE FIRST OPENED IT SHE THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN SENT TO HER BY SOME IMPUDENT SHOE BLACK OR CHIMNEY SWEEPER BUT WHEN SHE HAD DIRECTED HER EYES TO THE BOTTOM AND READ THOUGH NOT I ASSURE YOU WITHOUT THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY
2269-165387-0008 RICKARD ROSTICK SHE WAS SO MUCH OPPRESSED WITH SHAME AND VEXATION THAT SHE TORE THE LETTER INTO A THOUSAND PIECES AND WAS READY TO BURST INTO TEARS
2269-165387-0009 HE WAS ALIKE REMARKABLE FOR THE POLITENESS OF HIS MANNERS AND HIS AGREEABLE ADDRESS FOR HE HAD SUCH A TREACHEROUS MEMORY
2269-165387-0010 THOUGH HE HAD BEEN FREQUENTLY REMINDED OF THE PROPRIETY AND INDEED THE NECESSITY OF OBSERVING THOSE LITTLE PUNCTILIOS OF GOOD BEHAVIOUR THAT HE SELDOM REMEMBERED WHEN ANY COMPANY ENTERED THE ROOM IN WHICH HE HAPPENED TO BE SITTING EITHER TO RISE FROM HIS CHAIR
2269-165387-0011 OR TAKE OFF HIS HAT AND WHEN HE WAS TOLD OF IT EITHER BY HIS PARENTS OR HIS MASTER HE WOULD
2269-165387-0012 GRINNING AND LEERING THE WHOLE TIME
2269-165387-0013 AND EVEN THEN HE WOULD GENERALLY FORGET TO FINISH THE RUDE CEREMONY BY MAKING ONE OF HIS DUCKING BOWS IT IS TRUE INDEED HE HAD BEEN UNDER THE HANDS OF A DANCING MASTER
2269-165387-0014 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE UTMOST CARE AND ASSIDUITY OF HIS TEACHER WHO WAS ESTEEMED A VERY EXCELLENT ONE HE WAS NEVER ABLE TO PERFORM A WHIT BETTER THAN HE DOES IN HIS PRESENT SHAPE IN SHORT
2269-165387-0015 YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE KEPT A HOG IN TRAINING FOR NEWMARKET RACES OR AN OX FOR HIS MAJESTY TO RIDE UPON AT A GRAND REVIEW AS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INITIATE MASTER DICKY RUSTICK IN THE ELEMENTS OF POLITENESS AND GOOD BREEDING
2269-165387-0016 WITH SUCH A DELICATE DISPOSITION AND SUCH AMIABLE TALENTS YOU WILL READILY PERCEIVE THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN A MOST AGREEABLE PLAY FELLOW
2269-165387-0017 HIS FAVORITE DIVERSION WAS THAT WHICH HAS BEEN DISTINGUISHED BY THE VULGAR BY THE WELL KNOWN NAME OF PULLY HAWLY IN WHICH HE SO MUCH EXCELLED THAT WHENEVER HE WAS INVITED BY THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO PLAY WITH THEM
2269-165387-0018 HE GENERALLY REWARDED THEIR CIVILITY BY TEARING THEIR COATS OR PULLING THEIR CLOTHES OFF THEIR BACKS BEFORE HE RETURNED HOME SO THAT AT LAST THEY BESTOWED UPON HIM BY GENERAL CONSENT THE HONOURABLE TITLE OF
2269-165387-0019 IT MUST HOWEVER BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS A YOUTH OF SUCH IMPARTIAL JUSTICE
2269-165387-0020 FOR WHAT WITH CLIMBING UP OLD TREES AND RAMBLING OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES TO SEEK FOR BIRDS NESTS HE COMMONLY APPEARED BY DINNER TIME HOW WELL SOEVER HE HAD BEEN DRESSED IN THE MORNING IN AS RAGGED A COAT
2269-165387-0021 AS HE WEARS AT PRESENT IT MUST ALSO BE REMARKED THAT IF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES SOON GREW WEARY AS INDEED THEY DID OF SUCH A ROUGH PLAY FELLOW HE IN HIS TURN
2269-165387-0022 WITH THESE HE COULD PULL AND HAWL AND ROMP AND TEAR AS LONG AS HE PLEASED AND THE MORE ACTIVE HE BECAME IN THIS RAGGAMUFFIN SPECIES OF DIVERSION THE MORE THEY RELISHED HIS COMPANY
2269-165387-0023 BUT UPON OCCASION HE COULD FIGHT AS WELL AS PLAY I MEAN WHEN HE EITHER WAS PROVOKED TO IT BY HIS EQUALS OR TEMPTED TO IT BY THE HOPES OF DEFRAUDING OF THEIR LITTLE PROPERTY
2269-165387-0024 HE WAS VERY FAR FROM CONFINING HIMSELF TO ANY RULES OF HONOUR OR TO THE ESTABLISHED LAWS OF WAR FOR INSTEAD OF BOXING FAIRLY HE WOULD KICK PULL HAIR BITE
2269-165387-0025 AND SCRATCH MOST UNMERCIFULLY AND NEVER FAIL TO TAKE EVERY ADVANTAGE OF HIS ANTAGONIST AFTER HE HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND FOR THESE REASONS
2269-165387-0026 DICK BEAR EVEN BY THE VULGAR BOYS IN THE STREETS AND MOST OF THEM AFTERWARDS TOOK CARE NEVER TO ENGAGE WITH HIM UNLESS WHEN THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER BOYS PRESENT TO SEE FAIR PLAY
2269-165387-0027 BUT WHOEVER DRAWS SUCH A CONCLUSION IN FAVOUR OF OUR HERO DICKY RUSTICK IS GREATLY MISTAKEN
2269-165387-0028 THOUGH HIS FATHER ALWAYS KEPT A HANDSOME TABLE IT AFFORDED SCARCELY ANY THING WHICH WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE PALATE OF MASTER RICHARD NOTHING WOULD GO DOWN WITH HIM BUT TARTS CUSTARDS AND THE MOST COSTLY CAKES AND PUDDINGS
2269-165387-0029 FOR AS TO GOOD ROAST AND BOILED MEAT AND PLAIN AND WHOLESOME PIES OR DUMPLINGS HE WOULD TURN UP HIS NOSE AT THEM AS IF THEY WERE FIT ONLY FOR VAGABONDS AND BEGGARS NAY EVEN TO THIS VERY HOUR
2269-165387-0030 AND IN HIS PRESENT CLUMSY SHAPE HE IS ALMOST AS DAINTY AS EVER FOR HE IS REMARKABLY FOND OF HONEY AND IF PERMITTED WOULD OFTEN EXPOSE HIS SHAGGY HEAD AND HIS EYES TO THE RESENTMENT OF THE BEES
2269-165387-0031 BY DISTURBING THEIR HIVES TO ROB THEM OF THEIR DELICIOUS STORE IT WAS HIS FONDNESS FOR NICETIES OF EVERY KIND WHICH SHORTENED HIS DAYS AND EASED HIS PARENTS OF THEIR APPREHENSIONS FOR A SON WHO
2269-165387-0032 HE SO WELL UNDERSTANDS WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING AND IS SO MUCH VEXED AT THE CHARACTER I HAVE GIVEN OF HIM WHICH HE KNOWS TO BE A VERY JUST ONE THAT IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO QUIT THE ROOM AND LEAVE HIM TO HIMSELF
2269-165387-0033 HE WILL PLEASURE YOU WITH ONE OF HIS BEST DANCES BEFORE YOU GO ACCORDINGLY AFTER THANKING THE BRAMIN FOR THE ACCOUNT HE HAD GIVEN US WE ALL PROMISED TO LEAVE MISTER BRUIN TO HIS OWN MEDITATION UPON WHICH
2269-165387-0034 AFTER TAKING TWO OR THREE SULKEY ROUNDS THE YOUNG SAVAGE REARED HIMSELF UPON HIS BUTTOCKS AND SHUFFLED A SARABAND WHICH LASTED A FEW MINUTES WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS DANCE
2269-165387-0035 HE SWAGGERED DOWN AGAIN UPON HIS FORE PAWS AND BY A SULLEN GROWL SEEMED TO CLAIM THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROMISE
