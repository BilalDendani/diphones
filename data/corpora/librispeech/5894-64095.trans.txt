5894-64095-0000 WHILE MISTER MUSGRAVE IS BORING THE ELDERLY SPINSTER ABOUT NEW SCARLET CLOAKS FOR THE GIRLS OF THE CHURCH CHOIR AND OTHER PARISH MATTERS GEORGE SHENSTONE IS STANDING ON THE TOPMOST STEP OF THE BOAT STAIR
5894-64095-0001 IN A MOOD OF MIND EVEN LESS ENVIABLE THAN HERS FOR HE HAS LOOKED DOWN INTO THE DOCK AND THERE SEES NO GWENDOLINE NEITHER BOAT NOR LADY NOR IS THERE SIGN OF EITHER UPON THE WATER FAR AS HE CAN COMMAND A VIEW OF IT
5894-64095-0002 NO SOUNDS SUCH AS HE WOULD WISH AND MIGHT EXPECT TO HEAR NO DIPPING OF OARS NOR WHAT WOULD BE STILL MORE AGREEABLE TO HIS EAR THE SOFT VOICES OF WOMEN INSTEAD ONLY THE NOTE OF A CUCKOO IN MONOTONOUS REPETITION
5894-64095-0003 THE BIRD BALANCING ITSELF ON A BRANCH NEAR BY AND FARTHER OFF THE HICCOL LAUGHING AS IF IN MOCKERY AND AT HIM MOCKING HIS IMPATIENCE AY SOMETHING MORE ALMOST HIS MISERY THAT IT IS SO HIS SOLILOQUY TELLS

5894-64095-0005 HIS NONCOMPREHENSION DOES NOT HINDER A DARK SHADOW FROM STEALING OVER HIS BROW AND THERE STAYING IT IS NOT UNOBSERVED THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE EVERGREEN JOSEPH NOTES THE PAINED EXPRESSION
5894-64095-0006 AND INTERPRETS IT IN HIS OWN SHREWD WAY NOT FAR FROM THE RIGHT ONE THE OLD SERVANT SOLILOQUISING IN LESS CONJECTURAL STRAIN SAYS OR RATHER THINKS MASTER GEORGE BE MAD SWEET ON MISS GWEN
5894-64095-0007 THE COUNTRY FOLK ARE ALL TALKIN O'T THINKIN SHE'S SAME ON HIM AS IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT I KNOWS BETTER AN HE AIN'T NO WAYS CONFIDENT ELSE THERE WOULDN'T BE THAT QUEERY LOOK ON'S FACE IT'S THE TOKEN O JEALOUSY FOR SURE

5894-64095-0014 IN SUCH CASES HELP CAN ONLY COME FRAE THE PLACE WHERE THEY SAY MATCHES BE MADE THAT'S HEAVEN HA HE'S LOOKIN A BIT BRIGHTER WHAT'S CHEERIN HIM THE BOAT COMING BACK
5894-64095-0015 THE CHANGE HE NOTES IN GEORGE SHENSTONE'S MANNER IS NOT CAUSED BY THE RETURNING PLEASURE CRAFT SIMPLY A REFLECTION WHICH CROSSING HIS MIND FOR THE MOMENT TRANQUILLISES HIM WHAT A STUPID I AM HE MUTTERS SELF ACCUSINGLY
5894-64095-0016 NOW I REMEMBER THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE HOUR WE WERE TO GO RIDING AND I SUPPOSE SHE UNDERSTOOD IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS SO THE LAST TIME WE WENT OUT TOGETHER BY JOVE YES IT'S ALL RIGHT I TAKE IT SHE'LL BE BACK IN GOOD TIME YET
5894-64095-0017 THUS REASSURED HE REMAINS LISTENING STILL MORE SATISFIED WHEN A DULL THUMPING SOUND IN REGULAR REPETITION TELLS HIM OF OARS WORKING IN THEIR ROWLOCKS WERE HE LEARNED IN BOATING TACTICS HE WOULD KNOW THERE ARE TWO PAIRS OF THEM
5894-64095-0018 AND THINK THIS STRANGE TOO SINCE THE GWENDOLINE CARRIES ONLY ONE BUT HE IS NOT SO SKILLED INSTEAD RATHER AVERSE TO AQUATICS HIS CHOSEN HOME THE HUNTING FIELD HIS FAVOURITE SEAT IN A SADDLE NOT ON A BOAT'S THWART
5894-64095-0019 IT IS ONLY WHEN THE PLASHING OF THE OARS IN THE TRANQUIL WATER OF THE BYE WAY IS BORNE CLEAR ALONG THE CLIFF THAT HE PERCEIVES THERE ARE TWO PAIRS AT WORK WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE OBSERVES TWO BOATS APPROACHING THE LITTLE DOCK WHERE BUT ONE BELONGS
5894-64095-0020 ALONE AT THAT LEADING BOAT DOES HE LOOK WITH EYES IN WHICH AS HE CONTINUES TO GAZE SURPRISE BECOMES WONDERMENT DASHED WITH SOMETHING LIKE DISPLEASURE THE BOAT HE HAS RECOGNISED AT THE FIRST GLANCE THE GWENDOLINE
5894-64095-0021 AS ALSO THE TWO LADIES IN THE STERN BUT THERE IS ALSO A MAN ON THE MID THWART PLYING THE OARS WHO THE DEUCE IS HE THUS TO HIMSELF GEORGE SHENSTONE PUTS IT NOT OLD JOE NOT THE LEAST LIKE HIM
5894-64095-0022 NOR IS IT THE FAMILY CHARON WHO SITS SOLITARY ON THE THWARTS OF THAT FOLLOWING INSTEAD JOSEPH IS NOW BY MISTER SHENSTONE'S SIDE PASSING HIM IN HASTE MAKING TO GO DOWN THE BOAT STAIRS WHAT'S THE MEANING OF ALL THIS JOE

5894-64095-0026 AND AS THE LADIES STEP OUT OF IT GEORGE SHENSTONE OVERHEARS A DIALOGUE WHICH INSTEAD OF QUIETING HIS PERTURBED SPIRIT BUT EXCITES HIM STILL MORE ALMOST TO MADNESS IT IS MISS WYNN WHO HAS COMMENCED IT SAYING
5894-64095-0027 THIS TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN PULLING HER BOAT AND HAS JUST ABANDONED THE OARS SOON AS SEEING ITS PAINTER IN THE HANDS OF THE SERVANT OH THANK YOU HE RETURNS I WOULD WITH PLEASURE BUT AS YOU SEE I'M NOT QUITE PRESENTABLE JUST NOW
5894-64095-0028 ANYTHING BUT FIT FOR A DRAWING ROOM SO I BEG YOU'LL EXCUSE ME TO DAY HIS SATURATED SHIRT FRONT WITH OTHER GARMENTS DRIPPING TELLS WHY THE APOLOGY BUT DOES NOT EXPLAIN EITHER THAT OR AUGHT ELSE TO HIM ON THE TOP OF THE STAIR
5894-64095-0029 WHO HEARKENING FURTHER HEARS OTHER SPEECHES WHICH WHILE PERPLEXING HIM DO NOUGHT TO ALLAY THE WILD TEMPEST NOW SURGING THROUGH HIS SOUL UNSEEN HIMSELF FOR HE HAS STEPPED BEHIND THE TREE LATELY SCREENING JOSEPH HE SEES GWEN WYNN

5894-64095-0031 ALL THIS GEORGE SHENSTONE OBSERVES DRAWING DEDUCTIONS WHICH SEND THE BLOOD IN CHILL CREEP THROUGH HIS VEINS THOUGH STILL PUZZLED BY THE WET GARMENTS THE PRESENCE OF THE GENTLEMAN WEARING THEM SEEMS TO SOLVE THAT OTHER ENIGMA
5894-64095-0032 UNEXPLAINED AS PAINFUL THE STRANGENESS HE HAS OF LATE OBSERVED IN THE WAYS OF MISS WYNN NOR IS HE FAR OUT IN HIS FANCY
5894-64095-0033 NOT UNTIL THE TWO LADIES HAVE REACHED THE STAIR HEAD DO THEY BECOME AWARE OF HIS BEING THERE AND NOT THEN TILL GWEN HAS MADE SOME OBSERVATIONS TO THE COMPANION WHICH AS THOSE ADDRESSED TO THE STRANGER UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF

5894-64095-0039 BAD OR GOOD I DON'T THINK YOU ARE JUSTIFIED IN ATTRIBUTING IT TO CHANCE WHEN A GENTLEMAN DELIBERATELY STATIONS HIMSELF BEHIND A SHADY BUSH LIKE THAT LAURUSTINUS FOR INSTANCE AND THERE STANDS LISTENING INTENTIONALLY
5894-64095-0040 SUDDENLY SHE INTERRUPTS HERSELF AND STANDS SILENT TOO THIS ON OBSERVING THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS AND THAT THEY HAVE STRUCK TERRIBLY HOME WITH BOWED HEAD THE BARONET'S SON IS STOOPING TOWARDS HER THE CLOUD ON HIS BROW TELLING OF SADNESS NOT ANGER
