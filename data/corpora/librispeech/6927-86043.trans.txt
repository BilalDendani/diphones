6927-86043-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A POOR OLD MAN WHOSE NAME WAS WALI DAD GUNJAY OR WALI DAD THE BALD HE HAD NO RELATIONS BUT LIVED ALL BY HIMSELF IN A LITTLE MUD HUT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY TOWN
6927-86043-0001 AND MADE HIS LIVING BY CUTTING GRASS IN THE JUNGLE AND SELLING IT AS FODDER FOR HORSES HE ONLY EARNED BY THIS FIVE HALFPENCE A DAY BUT HE WAS A SIMPLE OLD MAN AND NEEDED SO LITTLE OUT OF IT THAT HE SAVED UP ONE HALFPENNY DAILY
6927-86043-0002 SO HE SET TO WORK AND WITH MUCH TROUBLE HE PULLED THE BAG OUT ON TO THE FLOOR AND SAT GAZING IN ASTONISHMENT AT THE HEAP OF COINS WHICH TUMBLED OUT OF IT WHAT SHOULD HE DO WITH THEM ALL HE WONDERED
6927-86043-0003 WITH THE RESPECTFUL COMPLIMENTS OF ONE WHO ADMIRES VIRTUE FAR MORE THAN HE DESIRES WEALTH WITH THAT HE PULLED THE BRACELET FROM HIS WAISTBAND AND HANDED IT TO HIS FRIEND
6927-86043-0004 AND SENT IN THE BRACELET NEATLY PACKED IN A LITTLE PERFUMED BOX PROVIDED BY HIMSELF GIVING AT THE SAME TIME THE MESSAGE ENTRUSTED TO HIM BY WALI DAD THE PRINCESS COULD NOT THINK WHO COULD HAVE BESTOWED THIS PRESENT ON HER
6927-86043-0005 AND RECEIVED FROM THE PRINCESS A RETURN PRESENT IN THE SHAPE OF A CAMEL LOAD OR RICH SILKS BESIDES A PRESENT OF MONEY FOR HIMSELF WITH THESE HE SET OUT ON HIS JOURNEY SOME MONTHS LATER HE GOT HOME AGAIN FROM HIS JOURNEYINGS
6927-86043-0006 AND PROCEEDED TO TAKE WALI DAD THE PRINCESS'S PRESENT GREAT WAS THE PERPLEXITY OF THE GOOD MAN TO FIND A CAMEL LOAD OF SILKS TUMBLED AT HIS DOOR WHAT WAS HE TO DO WITH THESE COSTLY THINGS BUT PRESENTLY AFTER MUCH THOUGHT
6927-86043-0007 HE BEGGED THE MERCHANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE DID NOT KNOW OF SOME YOUNG PRINCE TO WHOM SUCH TREASURES MIGHT BE USEFUL OF COURSE CRIED THE MERCHANT GREATLY AMUSED
6927-86043-0008 I KNOW THEM ALL AND THERE LIVES NONE WORTHIER THAN THE GALLANT AND WEALTHY YOUNG PRINCE OF NEKABAD VERY WELL THEN TAKE THE SILKS TO HIM WITH THE BLESSING OF AN OLD MAN SAID WALI DAD MUCH RELIEVED TO BE RID OF THEM
6927-86043-0009 AND BEGGED THE YOUNG MAN TO ACCEPT THEM AS A HUMBLE TRIBUTE TO HIS WORTH AND GREATNESS THE PRINCE WAS MUCH TOUCHED BY THE GENEROSITY OF THE GIVER AND ORDERED AS A RETURN PRESENT TWELVE OF THE FINEST BREED OF HORSES
6927-86043-0010 FOR WHICH HIS COUNTRY WAS FAMOUS TO BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE MERCHANT TO WHOM ALSO BEFORE HE TOOK HIS LEAVE HE GAVE A MUNIFICENT REWARD FOR HIS SERVICES AS BEFORE THE MERCHANT AT LAST ARRIVED AT HOME
6927-86043-0011 AND NEXT DAY HE SET OUT FOR WALI DAD'S HOUSE WITH THE TWELVE HORSES WHEN THE OLD MAN SAW THEM COMING IN THE DISTANCE HE SAID TO HIMSELF HERE'S LUCK A TROOP OF HORSES COMING THEY ARE SURE TO WANT QUANTITIES OF GRASS
6927-86043-0012 AND I SHALL SELL ALL I HAVE WITHOUT HAVING TO DRAG IT TO MARKET THEREUPON HE RUSHED OFF AND CUT GRASS AS FAST HE COULD WHEN HE GOT BACK WITH AS MUCH GRASS AS HE COULD POSSIBLY CARRY
6927-86043-0013 THAT THE HORSES WERE ALL FOR HIMSELF AT FIRST HE COULD NOT THINK WHAT TO DO WITH THEM BUT AFTER A LITTLE A BRILLIANT IDEA STRUCK HIM HE GAVE TWO TO THE MERCHANT
6927-86043-0014 THIS TIME THE PRINCESS SENT FOR THE MERCHANT AND QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE GIVER NOW THE MERCHANT WAS USUALLY A MOST HONEST MAN BUT HE DID NOT QUITE LIKE TO DESCRIBE WALI DAD IN HIS TRUE LIGHT AS AN OLD MAN WHOSE INCOME WAS FIVE HALFPENCE A DAY
6927-86043-0015 AND WHO HAD HARDLY CLOTHES TO COVER HIM SO HE TOLD HER THAT HIS FRIEND HAD HEARD STORIES OF HER BEAUTY AND GOODNESS
6927-86043-0016 AND HE HAD TO HIRE A NUMBER OF ARMED MEN TO DEFEND IT ON THE ROAD AGAINST THE ROBBERS AND HE WAS GLAD INDEED TO FIND HIMSELF BACK AGAIN IN WALI DAD'S HUT WELL NOW
6927-86043-0017 I SHALL THANK YOU HEARTILY THE MERCHANT FELT HANDSOMELY REPAID FOR HIS TROUBLE AND WONDERED GREATLY HOW THE MATTER WOULD TURN OUT
6927-86043-0018 THIS TIME THE PRINCE TOO WAS EMBARRASSED AND QUESTIONED THE MERCHANT CLOSELY THE MERCHANT FELT THAT HIS CREDIT WAS AT STAKE AND WHILST INWARDLY DETERMINING THAT HE WOULD NOT CARRY THE JOKE ANY FURTHER
6927-86043-0019 IN SUCH GLOWING TERMS THAT THE OLD MAN WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN HIMSELF HAD HE HEARD THEM THE PRINCE LIKE THE KING OF KHAISTAN DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD SEND IN RETURN A GIFT THAT WOULD BE TRULY ROYAL
6927-86043-0020 ALSO TWENTY CAMELS OF THE BEST BREED WHICH HAD THE SPEED OF RACE HORSES AND COULD SWING ALONG AT A TROT ALL DAY WITHOUT GETTING TIRED
6927-86043-0021 COVERINGS OF SILK EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS TO TAKE CARE OF THESE ANIMALS THE MERCHANT HIRED A LITTLE ARMY OF MEN AND THE TROOP MADE A GREAT SHOW AS THEY TRAVELLED ALONG WHEN WALI DAD FROM A DISTANCE SAW THE CLOUD OF DUST WHICH THE CARAVAN MADE
6927-86043-0022 AND THE GLITTER OF ITS APPOINTMENTS HE SAID TO HIMSELF BY ALLAH HERE'S A GRAND CROWD COMING ELEPHANTS TOO
6927-86043-0023 AND WITH THAT HE HURRIED OFF TO THE JUNGLE AND CUT GRASS AS FAST AS HE COULD
6927-86043-0024 A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY TO TELL HIM THE NEWS AND TO CONGRATULATE HIM UPON HIS RICHES RICHES CRIED WALI DAD WHAT HAS AN OLD MAN LIKE ME WITH ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE TO DO WITH RICHES THAT BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PRINCESS NOW
6927-86043-0025 SHE'D BE THE ONE TO ENJOY ALL THESE FINE THINGS DO YOU TAKE FOR YOURSELF TWO HORSES TWO CAMELS AND TWO ELEPHANTS WITH ALL THEIR TRAPPINGS AND PRESENT THE REST TO HER
6927-86043-0026 THESE EMBASSIES A LITTLE AWKWARD OF COURSE HE WAS HIMSELF RICHLY REPAID SO FAR AS EXPENSES WENT BUT STILL HE DID NOT LIKE GOING SO OFTEN AND HE WAS GETTING NERVOUS AT LENGTH HOWEVER HE CONSENTED TO GO ONCE MORE
6927-86043-0027 BUT HE PROMISED HIMSELF NEVER TO EMBARK ON ANOTHER SUCH ENTERPRISE SO AFTER A FEW DAYS REST THE CARAVAN STARTED OFF ONCE MORE FOR KHAISTAN THE MOMENT THE KING OF KHAISTAN SAW THE GORGEOUS TRAIN OF MEN AND BEASTS ENTERING HIS PALACE COURTYARD
6927-86043-0028 AND BECAME DUMB WHEN HE HEARD THAT THESE ALSO WERE A PRESENT FROM THE PRINCELY WALI DAD AND WERE FOR THE PRINCESS HIS DAUGHTER HE WENT HASTILY OFF TO HER APARTMENTS AND SAID TO HER I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS MY DEAR THIS MAN WANTS TO MARRY YOU
6927-86043-0029 THAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THESE PRESENTS THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT WE GO AND PAY HIM A VISIT IN PERSON
6927-86043-0030 PERHAPS YOU MIGHT DO WORSE THAN MARRY HIM THE PRINCESS AGREED WITH ALL THAT HER FATHER SAID AND ORDERS WERE ISSUED FOR VAST NUMBERS OF ELEPHANTS AND CAMELS AND GORGEOUS TENTS AND FLAGS AND LITTERS FOR THE LADIES AND HORSES FOR THE MEN
6927-86043-0031 WILLINGLY WOULD HE HAVE RUN AWAY BUT HE WAS TREATED WITH SO MUCH HOSPITALITY AS WALI DAD'S REPRESENTATIVE THAT HE HARDLY GOT AN INSTANT'S REAL PEACE AND NEVER ANY OPPORTUNITY OF SLIPPING AWAY
6927-86043-0032 THAT ALL THAT HAPPENED WAS FATE AND THAT ESCAPE WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT HE HOPED DEVOUTLY SOME TURN OF FORTUNE WOULD REVEAL TO HIM A WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH HE HAD WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS DRAWN UPON HIMSELF
6927-86043-0033 AS HE WOULD HAVE SUFFERED IF THE KING'S EXECUTIONERS WERE ALREADY SETTING TO WORK UPON HIS NECK AT LAST THEY WERE ONLY ONE DAY'S MARCH FROM WALI DAD'S LITTLE MUD HOME HERE
6927-86043-0034 A GREAT ENCAMPMENT WAS MADE AND THE MERCHANT WAS SENT ON TO TELL WALI DAD THAT THE KING AND PRINCESS OF KHAISTAN HAD ARRIVED AND WERE SEEKING AN INTERVIEW WHEN THE MERCHANT ARRIVED HE FOUND THE POOR OLD MAN EATING HIS EVENING MEAL OF ONIONS AND DRY BREAD
6927-86043-0035 AND WHEN HE TOLD HIM OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED HE HAD NOT THE HEART TO PROCEED TO LOAD HIM WITH THE REPROACHES WHICH ROSE TO HIS TONGUE FOR WALI DAD WAS OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF AND SHAME FOR HIMSELF
6927-86043-0036 FOR HIS FRIEND AND FOR THE NAME AND HONOUR OF THE PRINCESS AND HE WEPT AND PLUCKED AT HIS BEARD AND GROANED MOST PITEOUSLY
6927-86043-0037 OF GREAT HEIGHT AND DETERMINED TO THROW HIMSELF DOWN AND PUT AN END TO HIS LIFE WHEN HE GOT TO THE PLACE HE DREW BACK A FEW PACES TOOK A LITTLE RUN
6927-86043-0038 HE COULD NOT DO IT FROM BELOW UNSEEN IN THE BLACKNESS OF THE DEEP NIGHT SHADOWS THE WATER ROARED AND BOILED ROUND THE JAGGED ROCKS HE COULD PICTURE THE PLACE AS HE KNEW IT ONLY TEN TIMES MORE PITILESS
6927-86043-0039 AND FORBIDDING IN THE VISIONLESS DARKNESS
6927-86043-0040 AND THE BUSHES AND GRASSES THAT GREW IN THE LEDGES OF THE CLIFFS SEEMED TO HIM LIKE LIVING CREATURES THAT DANCED AND BECKONED SHADOWY AND INDISTINCT AN OWL LAUGHED HOO HOO ALMOST IN HIS FACE
6927-86043-0041 PRESENTLY HE WAS AWARE OF A GENTLE RADIANCE THAT SHED ITSELF BEFORE HIM SURELY MORNING WAS NOT ALREADY COMING TO HASTEN AND REVEAL HIS DISGRACE HE TOOK HIS HANDS FROM BEFORE HIS FACE
6927-86043-0042 AND SAW BEFORE HIM TWO LOVELY BEINGS WHOM HIS INSTINCT TOLD HIM WERE NOT MORTAL BUT WERE PERIS FROM PARADISE WHY DO YOU WEEP OLD MAN SAID ONE IN A VOICE AS CLEAR AND MUSICAL AS THAT OF THE BULBUL
6927-86043-0043 THEN THE FIRST STEPPED FORWARD AND LAID A HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER AND WALI DAD BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SOMETHING STRANGE WHAT HE DID NOT KNOW WAS HAPPENING TO HIM HIS OLD COTTON RAGS OF CLOTHES WERE CHANGED TO BEAUTIFUL LINEN AND EMBROIDERED CLOTH
6927-86043-0044 ON HIS HARD BARE FEET WERE WARM SOFT SHOES AND ON HIS HEAD A GREAT JEWELLED TURBAN ROUND HIS NECK THERE LAY A HEAVY GOLDEN CHAIN AND THE LITTLE OLD BENT SICKLE WHICH HE CUT GRASS WITH AND WHICH HUNG IN HIS WAISTBAND
6927-86043-0045 AND UP AN AVENUE OF GIANT PLACE TREES THE PERIS LED HIM DUMB WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE END OF THE AVENUE ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE HIS HUT HAD STOOD A GORGEOUS PALACE APPEARED ABLAZE WITH MYRIADS OF LIGHTS
6927-86043-0046 ITS GREAT PORTICOES AND VERANDAHS WERE OCCUPIED BY HURRYING SERVANTS AND GUARDS PACED TO AND FRO AND SALUTED HIM RESPECTFULLY AS HE DREW NEAR ALONG MOSSY WALKS AND THROUGH SWEEPING GRASSY LAWNS WHERE FOUNTAINS WERE PLAYING
6927-86043-0047 AND FLOWERS SCENTED THE AIR WALI DAD STOOD STUNNED AND HELPLESS FEAR NOT SAID ONE OF THE PERIS GO TO YOUR HOUSE AND LEARN THAT GOD REWARDS THE SIMPLE HEARTED WITH THESE WORDS THEY BOTH DISAPPEARED AND LEFT HIM
6927-86043-0048 A GREAT STRETCH OF WILD JUNGLE COUNTRY HAD IN THE NIGHT BEEN CHANGED INTO PARKS AND GARDENS AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR SOME OF WALI DAD'S NEW SERVANTS WHO FOUND HIM AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE PALACE
6927-86043-0049 DOWN TO THE VERY HUMBLEST IN THE CAMP FOR THREE NIGHTS AND DAYS A GREAT FEAST WAS HELD IN HONOUR OF THE ROYAL GUESTS EVERY EVENING THE KING AND HIS NOBLES WERE SERVED ON GOLDEN PLATES AND FROM GOLDEN CUPS AND THE SMALLER PEOPLE ON SILVER PLATES AND FROM SILVER CUPS
6927-86043-0050 AND DANCES AND AMUSEMENTS OF ALL SORTS ON THE FOURTH DAY THE KING OF KHAISTAN TOOK HIS HOST ASIDE AND ASKED HIM WHETHER IT WAS TRUE AS HE HAD SUSPECTED THAT HE WISHED TO MARRY HIS DAUGHTER
