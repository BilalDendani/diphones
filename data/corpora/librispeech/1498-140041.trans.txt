1498-140041-0000 RIVERBORO SECRETS MISTER SIMPSON SPENT LITTLE TIME WITH HIS FAMILY OWING TO CERTAIN AWKWARD METHODS OF HORSE TRADING OR THE SWAPPING OF FARM IMPLEMENTS AND VEHICLES OF VARIOUS KINDS OPERATIONS IN WHICH HIS CUSTOMERS WERE NEVER LONG SUITED
1498-140041-0001 AFTER EVERY SUCCESSFUL TRADE HE GENERALLY PASSED A LONGER OR SHORTER TERM IN JAIL FOR WHEN A POOR MAN WITHOUT GOODS OR CHATTELS HAS THE INVETERATE HABIT OF SWAPPING IT FOLLOWS NATURALLY THAT HE MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO SWAP
1498-140041-0002 AND HAVING NOTHING OF HIS OWN IT FOLLOWS STILL MORE NATURALLY THAT HE MUST SWAP SOMETHING BELONGING TO HIS NEIGHBORS MISTER SIMPSON WAS ABSENT FROM THE HOME CIRCLE FOR THE MOMENT BECAUSE HE HAD EXCHANGED THE WIDOW RIDEOUT'S SLEIGH FOR JOSEPH GOODWIN'S PLOUGH
1498-140041-0003 GOODWIN HAD LATELY MOVED TO NORTH EDGEWOOD AND HAD NEVER BEFORE MET THE URBANE AND PERSUASIVE MISTER SIMPSON THE GOODWIN PLOUGH MISTER SIMPSON SPEEDILY BARTERED WITH A MAN OVER WAREHAM WAY
1498-140041-0004 SIMPSON FATTENED THE AGED ANIMAL KEEPING HIM FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AT EARLY MORNING OR AFTER NIGHTFALL IN ONE NEIGHBOR'S PASTURE AFTER ANOTHER
1498-140041-0005 SHE HAD NOT USED IT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND MIGHT NOT SIT IN IT FOR ANOTHER FIFTEEN BUT IT WAS PROPERTY AND SHE DID NOT INTEND TO PART WITH IT WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
1498-140041-0006 HER THOUGHT AT ONCE REVERTED TO ABNER SIMPSON
1498-140041-0007 AND SO TORTUOUS THE PATHS OF ITS PROGRESS PARTLY OWING TO THE COMPLETE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OWNER OF THE HORSE WHO HAD GONE TO THE WEST AND LEFT NO ADDRESS THAT IT TOOK THE SHERIFF MANY WEEKS TO PROVE MISTER SIMPSON'S GUILT TO THE TOWN'S AND TO THE WIDOW RIDEOUT'S SATISFACTION
1498-140041-0008 ABNER HIMSELF AVOWED HIS COMPLETE INNOCENCE AND TOLD THE NEIGHBORS HOW A RED HAIRED MAN WITH A HARE LIP AND A PEPPER AND SALT SUIT OF CLOTHES HAD CALLED HIM UP ONE MORNING ABOUT DAYLIGHT AND OFFERED TO SWAP HIM A GOOD SLEIGH FOR AN OLD CIDER PRESS HE HAD LAYIN OUT IN THE DOORYARD
1498-140041-0009 THE BARGAIN WAS STRUCK AND HE ABNER HAD PAID THE HARE LIPPED STRANGER FOUR DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS TO BOOT WHEREUPON THE MYSTERIOUS ONE SET DOWN THE SLEIGH TOOK THE PRESS ON HIS CART AND VANISHED UP THE ROAD NEVER TO BE SEEN OR HEARD FROM AFTERWARDS
1498-140041-0010 IF I COULD ONCE KETCH THAT CONSARNED OLD THIEF EXCLAIMED ABNER RIGHTEOUSLY I'D MAKE HIM DANCE WORKIN OFF A STOLEN SLEIGH ON ME AN TAKIN AWAY MY GOOD MONEY AN CIDER PRESS TO SAY NOTHIN O MY CHARACTER
1498-140041-0011 AND THAT THERE CHARACTER AND THAT THERE FOUR SEVENTY FIVE O YOURN NOBODY EVER SEE ANY OF EM BUT YOU AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE EM AGAIN MISSUS SIMPSON WHO WAS DECIDEDLY ABNER'S BETTER HALF TOOK IN WASHING AND WENT OUT TO DO DAYS CLEANING
1498-140041-0012 AND THE TOWN HELPED IN THE FEEDING AND CLOTHING OF THE CHILDREN GEORGE A LANKY BOY OF FOURTEEN DID CHORES ON NEIGHBORING FARMS AND THE OTHERS SAMUEL CLARA BELLE SUSAN ELIJAH AND ELISHA WENT TO SCHOOL WHEN SUFFICIENTLY CLOTHED AND NOT OTHERWISE MORE PLEASANTLY ENGAGED
1498-140041-0013 THERE WERE NO SECRETS IN THE VILLAGES THAT LAY ALONG THE BANKS OF PLEASANT RIVER THERE WERE MANY HARD WORKING PEOPLE AMONG THE INHABITANTS
1498-140041-0014 UNDER THE TREES AT NOON IN THE HAYFIELD HANGING OVER THE BRIDGE AT NIGHTFALL SEATED ABOUT THE STOVE IN THE VILLAGE STORE OF AN EVENING THESE MEETING PLACES FURNISHED AMPLE GROUND FOR THE DISCUSSION OF CURRENT EVENTS AS VIEWED BY THE MASCULINE EYE
1498-140041-0015 WHILE CHOIR REHEARSALS SEWING SOCIETIES READING CIRCLES CHURCH PICNICS AND THE LIKE GAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXPRESSION OF FEMININE OPINION
1498-140041-0016 ALL THIS WAS TAKEN VERY MUCH FOR GRANTED AS A RULE BUT NOW AND THEN SOME SUPERSENSITIVE PERSON MADE VIOLENT OBJECTIONS TO IT AS A THEORY OF LIFE
1498-140041-0017 SHE FELL ILL AND ALTHOUGH ATTENDED BY ALL THE PHYSICIANS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SINKING SLOWLY INTO A DECLINE WHEN HER COUSIN CYRUS ASKED HER TO COME AND KEEP HOUSE FOR HIM IN LEWISTON SHE WENT AND IN A YEAR GREW INTO A ROBUST HEARTY CHEERFUL WOMAN
1498-140041-0018 RETURNING TO RIVERBORO ON A BRIEF VISIT SHE WAS ASKED IF SHE MEANT TO END HER DAYS AWAY FROM HOME I DO MOST CERTAINLY IF I CAN GET ANY OTHER PLACE TO STAY SHE RESPONDED CANDIDLY
1498-140041-0019 I WAS BEIN WORN TO A SHADDER HERE TRYIN TO KEEP MY LITTLE SECRETS TO MYSELF AN NEVER SUCCEEDIN FIRST THEY HAD IT I WANTED TO MARRY THE MINISTER AND WHEN HE TOOK A WIFE IN STANDISH I WAS KNOWN TO BE DISAPPOINTED
1498-140041-0020 THEN FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS THEY SUSPICIONED I WAS TRYIN FOR A PLACE TO TEACH SCHOOL AND WHEN I GAVE UP HOPE AN TOOK TO DRESSMAKIN THEY PITIED ME AND SYMPATHIZED WITH ME FOR THAT
1498-140041-0021 FOR THAT SPITES EM WORSE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
1498-140041-0022 I GAVE GOOD NEWS OF HIM FOR THIRTY YEARS RUNNIN
1498-140041-0023 THEY KNEW WHEN I HAD MY TEETH OUT AND A NEW SET MADE THEY KNEW WHEN I PUT ON A FALSE FRONT PIECE THEY KNEW WHEN THE FRUIT PEDDLER ASKED ME TO BE HIS THIRD WIFE I NEVER TOLD EM AN YOU CAN BE SURE HE NEVER DID BUT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE TOLD IN THIS VILLAGE
1498-140041-0024 THEY HAVE NOTHIN TO DO BUT GUESS AN THEY'LL GUESS RIGHT EVERY TIME I WAS ALL TUCKERED OUT TRYIN TO MISLEAD EM AND DECEIVE EM AND SIDETRACK EM
1498-140041-0025 COUSIN CYRUS IS AN OLD MAN AN CONSID'ABLE TROUBLE BUT HE THINKS MY TEETH ARE HANDSOME AN SAYS I'VE GOT A SPLENDID SUIT OF HAIR THERE AIN'T A PERSON IN LEWISTON THAT KNOWS ABOUT THE MINISTER OR FATHER'S WILL
1498-140041-0026 AN IF THEY SHOULD FIND OUT THEY WOULDN'T CARE AN THEY COULDN'T REMEMBER
1498-140041-0027 BUT IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE THAT REBECCA AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER RIVERBORO CHILDREN HAD HEARD THE PARTICULARS OF THE WIDOW RIDEOUT'S MISSING SLEIGH AND ABNER SIMPSON'S SUPPOSED CONNECTION WITH IT THERE IS NOT AN EXCESS OF DELICACY OR CHIVALRY IN THE ORDINARY COUNTRY SCHOOL
1498-140041-0028 REBECCA RANDALL WAS OF PRECISELY THE SAME STOCK AND HAD HAD MUCH THE SAME ASSOCIATIONS AS HER SCHOOLMATES SO ONE CAN HARDLY SAY WHY SHE SO HATED MEAN GOSSIP AND SO INSTINCTIVELY HELD HERSELF ALOOF FROM IT
1498-140041-0029 WHO WAS ANYTHING BUT A GENERAL FAVORITE SHE WAS A FERRET EYED BLOND HAIRED SPINDLE LEGGED LITTLE CREATURE WHOSE MIND WAS A CROSS BETWEEN THAT OF A PARROT AND A SHEEP SHE WAS SUSPECTED OF COPYING ANSWERS FROM OTHER GIRLS SLATES ALTHOUGH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN CAUGHT IN THE ACT
1498-140041-0030 BECAUSE ON THOSE DAYS SHE FORSOOK THE CHEERFUL SOCIETY OF HER MATES AND SOUGHT A SAFE SOLITUDE IN THE WOODS RETURNING AFTER A TIME WITH A JOCUND SMILE ON HER SMUG FACE AFTER ONE OF THESE PRIVATE LUNCHEONS REBECCA HAD BEEN TEMPTED BEYOND HER STRENGTH
1498-140041-0031 IS YOUR HEADACHE BETTER MINNIE LET ME WIPE OFF THAT STRAWBERRY JAM OVER YOUR MOUTH
1498-140041-0032 REBECCA CONFESSED TO EMMA JANE THAT SAME AFTERNOON THAT SHE FELT ASHAMED OF HER PRANK I DO HATE HER WAYS SHE EXCLAIMED BUT I'M SORRY I LET HER KNOW WE SPECTED HER AND SO TO MAKE UP I GAVE HER THAT LITTLE PIECE OF BROKEN CORAL I KEEP IN MY BEAD PURSE
1498-140041-0033 YOU KNOW THE ONE IT DON'T HARDLY SEEM AS IF SHE DESERVED THAT AND HER SO GREEDY REMARKED EMMA JANE I KNOW IT BUT IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER SAID REBECCA LARGELY
1498-140041-0034 THE CORAL HAD PARTLY SERVED ITS PURPOSE AS A RECONCILING BOND
1498-140041-0035 WAS RETURNING HOME BY WAY OF THE SHORT CUT
1498-140041-0036 SEESAW WAS NOT WITH THEM SO SHE HASTENED HER STEPS IN ORDER TO SECURE COMPANY ON HER HOMEWARD WALK
1498-140041-0037 CLARA BELLE SUSAN AND THE TWINS WERE RUNNING ALONG THE PATH AND MINNIE WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN SHRIEKING WHAT MADE THE SLEIGH LOVE SIMPSON SO THE EAGER CHILDREN CRIED WHY SIMPSON LOVED THE SLEIGH YOU KNOW THE TEACHER QUICK REPLIED
1498-140041-0038 THE LAST GLIMPSE OF THE ROUTED SIMPSON TRIBE
1498-140041-0039 THE FALL OF ONE SMALL STONE CAST BY THE VALIANT ELIJAH KNOWN AS THE FIGHTING TWIN DID BREAK THE STILLNESS OF THE WOODS FOR A MOMENT BUT IT DID NOT COME WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF MINNIE WHO SHOUTED JAIL BIRDS
1498-140041-0040 AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS AND THEN TURNED WITH AN AGREEABLE FEELING OF EXCITEMENT TO MEET REBECCA STANDING PERFECTLY STILL IN THE PATH WITH A DAY OF RECKONING PLAINLY SET FORTH IN HER BLAZING EYES
1498-140041-0041 IS NOT AN OBJECT OF DELIGHT MINNIE SMELLIE IF
1498-140041-0042 DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO ASKED REBECCA IN A TONE OF CONCENTRATED RAGE I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T CARE SAID MINNIE JAUNTILY THOUGH HER LOOKS BELIED HER I'LL TAKE THAT PIECE OF CORAL AWAY FROM YOU

1498-140041-0046 IF YOU DO IT AGAIN AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU SAY JAIL BIRDS IF I THINK IT'S RIGHT AND MY DUTY I SHALL PUNISH YOU SOMEHOW
1498-140041-0047 THE NEXT MORNING AT RECESS REBECCA OBSERVED MINNIE TELLING THE TALE WITH VARIATIONS TO HULDAH MESERVE SHE THREATENED ME WHISPERED MINNIE BUT I NEVER BELIEVE A WORD SHE SAYS
1498-140041-0048 THE LATTER REMARK WAS SPOKEN WITH THE DIRECT INTENTION OF BEING OVERHEARD FOR MINNIE HAD SPASMS OF BRAVERY WHEN WELL SURROUNDED BY THE MACHINERY OF LAW AND ORDER
1498-140041-0049 THIS WAS THE NOTE OF ALL THE GIRLS THAT ARE SO MEAN THERE'S NONE LIKE MINNIE SMELLIE I'LL TAKE AWAY THE GIFT I GAVE AND POUND HER INTO JELLY P S NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME R RANDALL
1498-140041-0050 THE EFFECT OF THIS PIECE OF DOGGEREL WAS ENTIRELY CONVINCING
