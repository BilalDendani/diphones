6950-86713-0016 BUT REFLECTING THAT THE SIGHT OF THE DEPUTY PROCUREUR RUNNING THROUGH THE STREETS WOULD BE ENOUGH TO THROW THE WHOLE CITY INTO CONFUSION HE RESUMED HIS ORDINARY PACE AT HIS DOOR HE PERCEIVED A FIGURE IN THE SHADOW THAT SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HIM IT WAS MERCEDES
6950-86713-0017 WHO HEARING NO NEWS OF HER LOVER HAD COME UNOBSERVED TO INQUIRE AFTER HIM
6950-86713-0018 HER BEAUTY AND HIGH BEARING SURPRISED HIM AND WHEN SHE INQUIRED WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER LOVER IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE WAS THE JUDGE AND HE THE ACCUSED
6950-86713-0019 BUT AT LEAST TELL ME WHERE HE IS THAT I MAY KNOW WHETHER HE IS ALIVE OR DEAD SAID SHE
6950-86713-0020 AND DESIROUS OF PUTTING AN END TO THE INTERVIEW HE PUSHED BY HER AND CLOSED THE DOOR AS IF TO EXCLUDE THE PAIN HE FELT BUT REMORSE IS NOT THUS BANISHED LIKE VIRGIL'S WOUNDED HERO HE CARRIED THE ARROW IN HIS WOUND
6950-86713-0021 THEN THE FIRST PANGS OF AN UNENDING TORTURE SEIZED UPON HIS HEART THE MAN HE SACRIFICED TO HIS AMBITION THAT INNOCENT VICTIM IMMOLATED ON THE ALTAR OF HIS FATHER'S FAULTS APPEARED TO HIM PALE AND THREATENING
6950-86713-0022 LEADING HIS AFFIANCED BRIDE BY THE HAND AND BRINGING WITH HIM REMORSE NOT SUCH AS THE ANCIENTS FIGURED FURIOUS AND TERRIBLE BUT THAT SLOW AND CONSUMING AGONY WHOSE PANGS ARE INTENSIFIED FROM HOUR TO HOUR UP TO THE VERY MOMENT OF DEATH
6950-86713-0023 THEN HE HAD A MOMENT'S HESITATION HE HAD FREQUENTLY CALLED FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ON CRIMINALS AND OWING TO HIS IRRESISTIBLE ELOQUENCE THEY HAD BEEN CONDEMNED
6950-86713-0024 BECAUSE THEY WERE GUILTY AT LEAST HE BELIEVED SO BUT HERE WAS AN INNOCENT MAN WHOSE HAPPINESS HE HAD DESTROYED IN THIS CASE HE WAS NOT THE JUDGE BUT THE EXECUTIONER
6950-86713-0025 AS HE THUS REFLECTED HE FELT THE SENSATION WE HAVE DESCRIBED AND WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN UNKNOWN TO HIM ARISE IN HIS BOSOM AND FILL HIM WITH VAGUE APPREHENSIONS
6950-86713-0026 IT IS THUS THAT A WOUNDED MAN TREMBLES INSTINCTIVELY AT THE APPROACH OF THE FINGER TO HIS WOUND UNTIL IT BE HEALED
6950-86713-0027 OR IF THEY DO ONLY CLOSE TO REOPEN MORE AGONIZING THAN EVER IF AT THIS MOMENT THE SWEET VOICE OF RENEE HAD SOUNDED IN HIS EARS PLEADING FOR MERCY OR THE FAIR MERCEDES HAD ENTERED AND SAID
6950-86713-0028 IN THE NAME OF GOD I CONJURE YOU TO RESTORE ME MY AFFIANCED HUSBAND HIS COLD AND TREMBLING HANDS WOULD HAVE SIGNED HIS RELEASE
6950-86713-0029 WHO CAME TO TELL HIM THAT THE TRAVELLING CARRIAGE WAS IN READINESS
6950-86713-0030 HASTILY OPENED ONE OF THE DRAWERS OF HIS DESK EMPTIED ALL THE GOLD IT CONTAINED INTO HIS POCKET STOOD MOTIONLESS AN INSTANT HIS HAND PRESSED TO HIS HEAD MUTTERED A FEW INARTICULATE SOUNDS
6950-86713-0031 AND THEN PERCEIVING THAT HIS SERVANT HAD PLACED HIS CLOAK ON HIS SHOULDERS HE SPRANG INTO THE CARRIAGE
6950-86713-0032 THE HAPLESS DANTES WAS DOOMED
6950-86713-0033 HE STARTED WHEN HE SAW RENEE FOR HE FANCIED SHE WAS AGAIN ABOUT TO PLEAD FOR DANTES
6950-86713-0034 AND RENEE FAR FROM PLEADING FOR DANTES HATED THE MAN WHOSE CRIME SEPARATED HER FROM HER LOVER MEANWHILE WHAT OF MERCEDES SHE HAD MET FERNAND AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DE LA LOGE SHE HAD RETURNED TO THE CATALANS
6950-86713-0035 AND HAD DESPAIRINGLY CAST HERSELF ON HER COUCH FERNAND KNEELING BY HER SIDE TOOK HER HAND AND COVERED IT WITH KISSES THAT MERCEDES DID NOT EVEN FEEL SHE PASSED THE NIGHT THUS
6950-86713-0036 THE LAMP WENT OUT FOR WANT OF OIL BUT SHE PAID NO HEED TO THE DARKNESS AND DAWN CAME BUT SHE KNEW NOT THAT IT WAS DAY GRIEF HAD MADE HER BLIND TO ALL BUT ONE OBJECT THAT WAS EDMOND
6950-86713-0037 I HAVE NOT QUITTED YOU SINCE YESTERDAY RETURNED FERNAND SORROWFULLY
6950-86713-0038 HE HAD LEARNED THAT DANTES HAD BEEN TAKEN TO PRISON AND HE HAD GONE TO ALL HIS FRIENDS AND THE INFLUENTIAL PERSONS OF THE CITY BUT THE REPORT WAS ALREADY IN CIRCULATION THAT DANTES WAS ARRESTED AS A BONAPARTIST AGENT
6950-86713-0039 AND AS THE MOST SANGUINE LOOKED UPON ANY ATTEMPT OF NAPOLEON TO REMOUNT THE THRONE AS IMPOSSIBLE HE MET WITH NOTHING BUT REFUSAL AND HAD RETURNED HOME IN DESPAIR DECLARING THAT THE MATTER WAS SERIOUS AND THAT NOTHING MORE COULD BE DONE
6950-86713-0040 HE HAD SHUT HIMSELF UP WITH TWO BOTTLES OF BLACK CURRANT BRANDY IN THE HOPE OF DROWNING REFLECTION BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED AND BECAME TOO INTOXICATED TO FETCH ANY MORE DRINK AND YET NOT SO INTOXICATED AS TO FORGET WHAT HAD HAPPENED
6950-86713-0041 WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE HE SAT BETWEEN THE TWO EMPTY BOTTLES WHILE SPECTRES DANCED IN THE LIGHT OF THE UNSNUFFED CANDLE SPECTRES SUCH AS HOFFMANN STREWS OVER HIS PUNCH DRENCHED PAGES LIKE BLACK FANTASTIC DUST
6950-86713-0042 DANGLARS ALONE WAS CONTENT AND JOYOUS HE HAD GOT RID OF AN ENEMY AND MADE HIS OWN SITUATION ON THE PHARAON SECURE DANGLARS WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN BORN WITH A PEN BEHIND THE EAR
6950-86713-0043 EVERYTHING WITH HIM WAS MULTIPLICATION OR SUBTRACTION THE LIFE OF A MAN WAS TO HIM OF FAR LESS VALUE THAN A NUMERAL ESPECIALLY WHEN BY TAKING IT AWAY HE COULD INCREASE THE SUM TOTAL OF HIS OWN DESIRES
6950-86713-0044 HE WENT TO BED AT HIS USUAL HOUR AND SLEPT IN PEACE
6950-86713-0045 EMBRACED RENEE KISSED THE MARQUISE'S HAND AND SHAKEN THAT OF THE MARQUIS STARTED FOR PARIS ALONG THE AIX ROAD
