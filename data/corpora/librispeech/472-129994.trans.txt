472-129994-0000 SHE HAD FOUND IN HER EVERY THING THAT COULD TEND TO MAKE A FARTHER CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES UNDESIRABLE
472-129994-0001 TO COMPREHEND ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST HAVE PERPLEXED THE ENGAGEMENT AND RETARDED THE MARRIAGE OF EDWARD AND HERSELF HAD HE BEEN OTHERWISE FREE AND SHE HAD SEEN ALMOST ENOUGH TO BE THANKFUL FOR HER OWN SAKE
472-129994-0002 OR TO ALLOW HER TO DERIVE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM A PREFERENCE ONLY GIVEN HER BECAUSE HER REAL SITUATION WAS UNKNOWN BUT THAT IT WAS SO HAD NOT ONLY BEEN DECLARED BY LUCY'S EYES AT THE TIME BUT WAS DECLARED OVER AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING MORE OPENLY
472-129994-0003 FOR AT HER PARTICULAR DESIRE LADY MIDDLETON SET HER DOWN IN BERKELEY STREET ON THE CHANCE OF SEEING ELINOR ALONE TO TELL HER HOW HAPPY SHE WAS THE CHANCE PROVED A LUCKY ONE
472-129994-0004 NO PRIDE NO HAUTEUR AND YOUR SISTER JUST THE SAME ALL SWEETNESS AND AFFABILITY ELINOR WISHED TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT LUCY STILL PRESSED HER TO OWN THAT SHE HAD REASON FOR HER HAPPINESS AND ELINOR WAS OBLIGED TO GO ON
472-129994-0005 AND HER LIKING ME IS EVERY THING YOU SHAN'T TALK ME OUT OF MY SATISFACTION
472-129994-0006 AND THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTIES AT ALL TO WHAT I USED TO THINK
472-129994-0007 TO THIS ELINOR HAD NO ANSWER TO MAKE AND DID NOT ATTEMPT ANY ARE YOU ILL MISS DASHWOOD YOU SEEM LOW YOU DON'T SPEAK SURE YOU AN'T WELL I NEVER WAS IN BETTER HEALTH
472-129994-0008 I AM GLAD OF IT WITH ALL MY HEART BUT REALLY YOU DID NOT LOOK IT
472-129994-0009 FOR LADY MIDDLETON'S DELIGHTED WITH MISSUS DASHWOOD SO WE SHALL BE A GOOD DEAL IN HARLEY STREET I DARE SAY AND EDWARD SPENDS HALF HIS TIME WITH HIS SISTER BESIDES LADY MIDDLETON AND MISSUS FERRARS WILL VISIT NOW
472-129994-0010 THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE GLAD TO SEE ME THEY ARE SUCH CHARMING WOMEN
472-129994-0011 AND NEVER LOOKED AT ME IN A PLEASANT WAY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I HAD BEEN TREATED IN THAT FORBIDDING SORT OF WAY
472-129994-0012 ELINOR WAS PREVENTED FROM MAKING ANY REPLY TO THIS CIVIL TRIUMPH BY THE DOOR'S BEING THROWN OPEN THE SERVANT'S ANNOUNCING MISTER FERRARS AND EDWARD'S IMMEDIATELY WALKING IN
472-129994-0013 IT WAS A VERY AWKWARD MOMENT AND THE COUNTENANCE OF EACH SHEWED THAT IT WAS SO THEY ALL LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY FOOLISH AND EDWARD SEEMED TO HAVE AS GREAT AN INCLINATION TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN AS TO ADVANCE FARTHER INTO IT
472-129994-0014 THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITS UNPLEASANTEST FORM WHICH THEY WOULD EACH HAVE BEEN MOST ANXIOUS TO AVOID HAD FALLEN ON THEM THEY WERE NOT ONLY ALL THREE TOGETHER BUT WERE TOGETHER WITHOUT THE RELIEF OF ANY OTHER PERSON
472-129994-0015 BUT ELINOR HAD MORE TO DO
472-129994-0016 TO DO IT WELL THAT SHE FORCED HERSELF AFTER A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION TO WELCOME HIM WITH A LOOK AND MANNER THAT WERE ALMOST EASY AND ALMOST OPEN AND ANOTHER STRUGGLE ANOTHER EFFORT STILL IMPROVED THEM
472-129994-0017 SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PRESENCE OF LUCY NOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME INJUSTICE TOWARDS HERSELF TO DETER HER FROM SAYING THAT SHE WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIM
472-129994-0018 SHE WOULD NOT BE FRIGHTENED FROM PAYING HIM THOSE ATTENTIONS WHICH AS A FRIEND AND ALMOST A RELATION WERE HIS DUE BY THE OBSERVANT EYES OF LUCY THOUGH SHE SOON PERCEIVED THEM TO BE NARROWLY WATCHING HER
472-129994-0019 HER MANNERS GAVE SOME RE ASSURANCE TO EDWARD AND HE HAD COURAGE ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN BUT HIS EMBARRASSMENT STILL EXCEEDED THAT OF THE LADIES IN A PROPORTION WHICH THE CASE RENDERED REASONABLE THOUGH HIS SEX MIGHT MAKE IT RARE
472-129994-0020 FOR HIS HEART HAD NOT THE INDIFFERENCE OF LUCY'S NOR COULD HIS CONSCIENCE HAVE QUITE THE EASE OF ELINOR'S LUCY WITH A DEMURE AND SETTLED AIR SEEMED DETERMINED TO MAKE NO CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE OTHERS
472-129994-0021 AND WOULD NOT SAY A WORD AND ALMOST EVERY THING THAT WAS SAID PROCEEDED FROM ELINOR
472-129994-0022 FOR SHE LOITERED AWAY SEVERAL MINUTES ON THE LANDING PLACE WITH THE MOST HIGH MINDED FORTITUDE BEFORE SHE WENT TO HER SISTER WHEN THAT WAS ONCE DONE HOWEVER IT WAS TIME FOR THE RAPTURES OF EDWARD TO CEASE FOR MARIANNE'S JOY HURRIED HER INTO THE DRAWING ROOM IMMEDIATELY
472-129994-0023 HER PLEASURE IN SEEING HIM WAS LIKE EVERY OTHER OF HER FEELINGS STRONG IN ITSELF AND STRONGLY SPOKEN SHE MET HIM WITH A HAND THAT WOULD BE TAKEN AND A VOICE THAT EXPRESSED THE AFFECTION OF A SISTER
472-129994-0024 AGAIN THEY ALL SAT DOWN AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO ALL WERE SILENT WHILE MARIANNE WAS LOOKING WITH THE MOST SPEAKING TENDERNESS SOMETIMES AT EDWARD AND SOMETIMES AT ELINOR REGRETTING ONLY THAT THEIR DELIGHT IN EACH OTHER SHOULD BE CHECKED BY LUCY'S UNWELCOME PRESENCE
472-129994-0025 EDWARD WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK AND IT WAS TO NOTICE MARIANNE'S ALTERED LOOKS AND EXPRESS HIS FEAR OF HER NOT FINDING LONDON AGREE WITH HER OH DON'T THINK OF ME SHE REPLIED WITH SPIRITED EARNESTNESS
472-129994-0026 SAID EDWARD WILLING TO SAY ANY THING THAT MIGHT INTRODUCE ANOTHER SUBJECT NOT AT ALL
472-129994-0027 AND THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE WHAT YOU ALWAYS WERE SHE PAUSED NO ONE SPOKE
472-129994-0028 AND OF HER BEING PARTICULARLY DISGUSTED WITH HIS MOTHER TILL THEY WERE MORE IN PRIVATE BUT WHY WERE YOU NOT THERE EDWARD WHY DID YOU NOT COME I WAS ENGAGED ELSEWHERE
472-129994-0029 PERHAPS MISS MARIANNE CRIED LUCY EAGER TO TAKE SOME REVENGE ON HER
472-129994-0030 ELINOR WAS VERY ANGRY BUT MARIANNE SEEMED ENTIRELY INSENSIBLE OF THE STING FOR SHE CALMLY REPLIED NOT SO INDEED FOR SERIOUSLY SPEAKING I AM VERY SURE THAT CONSCIENCE ONLY KEPT EDWARD FROM HARLEY STREET
472-129994-0031 AND I REALLY BELIEVE HE HAS THE MOST DELICATE CONSCIENCE IN THE WORLD THE MOST SCRUPULOUS IN PERFORMING EVERY ENGAGEMENT HOWEVER MINUTE
472-129994-0032 HE IS THE MOST FEARFUL OF GIVING PAIN OF WOUNDING EXPECTATION AND THE MOST INCAPABLE OF BEING SELFISH OF ANY BODY I EVER SAW EDWARD IT IS SO AND I WILL SAY IT
472-129994-0033 FOR THOSE WHO WILL ACCEPT OF MY LOVE AND ESTEEM MUST SUBMIT TO MY OPEN COMMENDATION THE NATURE OF HER COMMENDATION IN THE PRESENT CASE HOWEVER HAPPENED TO BE PARTICULARLY ILL SUITED TO THE FEELINGS OF TWO THIRDS OF HER AUDITORS AND WAS SO VERY UNEXHILARATING TO EDWARD
472-129994-0034 GOING SO SOON SAID MARIANNE MY DEAR EDWARD THIS MUST NOT BE AND DRAWING HIM A LITTLE ASIDE SHE WHISPERED HER PERSUASION THAT LUCY COULD NOT STAY MUCH LONGER
472-129994-0035 BUT EVEN THIS ENCOURAGEMENT FAILED FOR HE WOULD GO AND LUCY WHO WOULD HAVE OUTSTAID HIM HAD HIS VISIT LASTED TWO HOURS SOON AFTERWARDS WENT AWAY WHAT CAN BRING HER HERE SO OFTEN SAID MARIANNE ON HER LEAVING THEM
472-129994-0036 IT IS BUT NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AS WELL AS OURSELVES MARIANNE LOOKED AT HER STEADILY AND SAID
