1121-176698-0026 NOW THE ONLY QUESTION AS WORRITS ME
1121-176698-0027 YES SAID BELLEW I WONDER
1121-176698-0028 MISS PRISCILLA HAD BEEN RIGHT
1121-176698-0029 ALSO SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP AWAY FROM DAPPLEMERE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE THEREFORE DESPITE SMALL PORGES EXHORTATIONS AND BESS'S CHAMPING IMPATIENCE
1121-176698-0030 PERMITTING HER ONLY THE SLOWEST OF PACES WHICH WAS A MOST UNUSUAL THING FOR ANTHEA TO DO FOR THE MOST PART TOO
1121-176698-0031 WHICH WAS ALSO VERY UNLIKE IN HER BUT BEFORE HER EYES WERE VISIONS OF HER DISMANTLED HOME IN HER EARS WAS THE ROAR OF VOICES CLAMOURING FOR HER CHERISHED POSSESSIONS A SICKENING ROAR BROKEN NOW AND THEN
1121-176698-0032 BY THE HOLLOW TAP OF THE AUCTIONEER'S CRUEL HAMMER AND EACH TIME THE CLAMOURING VOICES ROSE SHE SHIVERED AND EVERY BLOW OF THE CRUEL HAMMER SEEMED TO FALL UPON HER QUIVERING HEART
1121-176698-0033 THUS SHE WAS UNWONTEDLY DEAF AND UNRESPONSIVE TO SMALL PORGES WHO PRESENTLY FELL INTO A PROFOUND GLOOM IN CONSEQUENCE AND THUS SHE HELD IN THE EAGER MARE WHO THEREFORE SHIED AND FIDGETED
1121-176698-0034 AND TOSSED HER HEAD INDIGNANTLY BUT SLOWLY AS THEY WENT THEY CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE AT LAST WITH ITS QUAINT GABLES AND MANY LATTICED WINDOWS AND THE BLUE SMOKE CURLING UP FROM ITS TWISTED CHIMNEYS
1121-176698-0035 SMILING AND PLACID AS THOUGH IN ALL THIS GREAT WORLD THERE WERE NO SUCH THING TO BE FOUND AS AN AUCTIONEER'S HAMMER AND PRESENTLY THEY SWUNG INTO THE DRIVE AND DREW UP IN THE COURTYARD AND THERE WAS ADAM
1121-176698-0036 ANTHEA CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE HIGH DOG CART AIDING SMALL PORGES TO EARTH AND WITH HIS HAND CLASPED TIGHT IN HERS AND WITH LIPS SET FIRM SHE TURNED AND ENTERED THE HALL BUT UPON THE THRESHOLD SHE STOPPED
1121-176698-0037 AND STOOD THERE UTTERLY STILL GAZING AND GAZING UPON THE TRIM ORDERLINESS OF EVERYTHING THEN SEEING EVERY WELL REMEMBERED THING IN ITS APPOINTED PLACE ALL BECAME SUDDENLY BLURRED AND DIM
1121-176698-0038 SHE UTTERED A GREAT CHOKING SOB AND COVERED HER FACE BUT SMALL PORGES HAD SEEN AND STOOD AGHAST AND MISS PRISCILLA HAD SEEN AND NOW HURRIED FORWARD WITH A QUICK TAP TAP OF HER STICK
1121-176698-0039 AND LOOKED FOR ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE BUT WAS NOT AND IN THAT MOMENT INSTINCTIVELY SHE KNEW HOW THINGS CAME TO BE AS THEY WERE AND BECAUSE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE HER CHEEKS FLAMED WITH A SWIFT BURNING COLOUR
1121-176698-0040 AND WITH A SOFT CRY SHE HID HER FACE IN MISS PRISCILLA'S GENTLE BOSOM THEN WHILE HER FACE WAS YET HIDDEN THERE SHE WHISPERED TELL ME TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BUT MEANWHILE BELLEW
1121-176698-0041 STRIDING FAR AWAY ACROSS THE MEADOWS SEEMING TO WATCH THE GLORY OF THE SUN SET AND TO HEARKEN TO A BLACKBIRD PIPING FROM THE DIM SECLUSION OF THE COPSE A MELODIOUS GOOD BYE TO THE DYING DAY YET SAW AND HEARD IT NOT AT ALL
