5506-69896-0027 THE COMING OF FLYING OCCURRED PEOPLE TALK GLIBLY ENOUGH OF EPOCH MAKING EVENTS THIS WAS AN EPOCH MAKING EVENT IT WAS THE UNANTICIPATED AND ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT
5506-69896-0028 OF MISTER ALFRED BUTTERIDGE FROM THE CRYSTAL PALACE TO GLASGOW AND BACK IN A SMALL BUSINESSLIKE LOOKING MACHINE HEAVIER THAN AIR AN ENTIRELY MANAGEABLE AND CONTROLLABLE MACHINE THAT COULD FLY AS WELL AS A PIGEON
5506-69896-0029 IT WASN'T ONE FELT A FRESH STEP FORWARD IN THE MATTER SO MUCH AS A GIANT STRIDE A LEAP MISTER BUTTERIDGE REMAINED IN THE AIR ALTOGETHER FOR ABOUT NINE HOURS AND DURING THAT TIME
5506-69896-0030 HE FLEW WITH THE EASE AND ASSURANCE OF A BIRD HIS MACHINE WAS HOWEVER NEITHER BIRD LIKE NOR BUTTERFLY LIKE NOR HAD IT THE WIDE LATERAL EXPANSION OF THE ORDINARY AEROPLANE THE EFFECT UPON THE OBSERVER WAS RATHER SOMETHING
5506-69896-0031 IN THE NATURE OF A BEE OR WASP PARTS OF THE APPARATUS WERE SPINNING VERY RAPIDLY AND GAVE ONE A HAZY EFFECT OF TRANSPARENT WINGS BUT PARTS INCLUDING TWO
5506-69896-0032 PECULIARLY CURVED WING CASES IF ONE MAY BORROW A FIGURE FROM THE FLYING BEETLES REMAINED EXPANDED STIFFLY
5506-69896-0033 COULD BE SEEN SITTING ASTRIDE MUCH AS A MAN BESTRIDES A HORSE THE WASP LIKE RESEMBLANCE WAS INCREASED BY THE FACT THAT THE APPARATUS FLEW WITH A DEEP BOOMING HUM EXACTLY THE SOUND MADE BY A WASP AT A WINDOWPANE
5506-69896-0034 MISTER BUTTERIDGE TOOK THE WORLD BY SURPRISE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE GENTLEMEN FROM NOWHERE FATE STILL SUCCEEDS IN PRODUCING FOR THE STIMULATION OF MANKIND HE CAME IT WAS VARIOUSLY SAID FROM AUSTRALIA
5506-69896-0035 AND AMERICA AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE HE WAS ALSO DESCRIBED QUITE INCORRECTLY AS THE SON OF A MAN WHO HAD AMASSED A COMFORTABLE FORTUNE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GOLD NIBS AND THE BUTTERIDGE FOUNTAIN PENS
5506-69896-0036 AND AN IMPLACABLE MANNER HE HAD BEEN AN UNDISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF MOST OF THE EXISTING AERONAUTICAL ASSOCIATIONS THEN ONE DAY HE WROTE TO ALL THE LONDON PAPERS TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN ASCENT FROM THE CRYSTAL PALACE
5506-69896-0037 OF A MACHINE THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE SATISFACTORILY THAT THE OUTSTANDING DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF FLYING WERE FINALLY SOLVED FEW OF THE PAPERS PRINTED HIS LETTER STILL FEWER WERE THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IN HIS CLAIM
5506-69896-0038 NO ONE WAS EXCITED EVEN WHEN A FRACAS ON THE STEPS OF A LEADING HOTEL IN PICCADILLY IN WHICH HE TRIED TO HORSE WHIP A PROMINENT GERMAN MUSICIAN UPON SOME PERSONAL ACCOUNT DELAYED HIS PROMISED ASCENT THE QUARREL WAS
5506-69896-0039 INADEQUATELY REPORTED AND HIS NAME SPELT VARIOUSLY BETTERIDGE AND BETRIDGE UNTIL HIS FLIGHT INDEED HE DID NOT AND COULD NOT CONTRIVE TO EXIST IN THE PUBLIC MIND
5506-69896-0040 THERE WERE SCARCELY THIRTY PEOPLE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS CLAMOUR WHEN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK ONE SUMMER MORNING THE DOORS OF THE BIG SHED IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER HIS APPARATUS OPENED IT WAS NEAR THE
5506-69896-0041 BIG MODEL OF A MEGATHERIUM IN THE CRYSTAL PALACE GROUNDS AND HIS GIANT INSECT CAME DRONING OUT INTO A NEGLIGENT AND INCREDULOUS WORLD
5506-69896-0042 BUT BEFORE HE HAD MADE HIS SECOND CIRCUIT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE TOWERS FAME WAS LIFTING HER TRUMPET SHE DREW A DEEP BREATH AS THE STARTLED TRAMPS WHO SLEEP
5506-69896-0043 ON THE SEATS OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE WERE ROUSED BY HIS BUZZ AND AWOKE TO DISCOVER HIM CIRCLING THE NELSON COLUMN AND BY THE TIME HE HAD GOT TO BIRMINGHAM WHICH PLACE HE CROSSED ABOUT HALF PAST TEN
5506-69896-0044 HER DEAFENING BLAST WAS ECHOING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE DESPAIRED OF THING WAS DONE A MAN WAS FLYING SECURELY AND WELL SCOTLAND WAS AGAPE FOR HIS COMING
5506-69896-0045 RESUMED WORK BEFORE HALF PAST TWO THE PUBLIC MIND WAS JUST SUFFICIENTLY EDUCATED
5506-69896-0046 TO APPRECIATE MISTER BUTTERIDGE AT HIS PROPER VALUE HE CIRCLED THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AND DROPPED TO WITHIN SHOUTING DISTANCE OF THE CROWDS IN WEST END PARK AND ON THE SLOPE OF GILMOREHILL
5506-69896-0047 THE THING FLEW QUITE STEADILY AT A PACE OF ABOUT THREE MILES AN HOUR IN A WIDE CIRCLE MAKING A DEEP HUM
