3245-62827-0000 ACCORDING TO MISTER MINNIGERODE THE MEN OF YALE WALK ABOUT THEIR CAMPUS IN BIG BLUE SWEATERS WITH Y'S ON THEM SMOKING PIPES AND SINGING COLLEGE SONGS UNDER THE WINDOWS OF ONE ANOTHER THE SENIORS
3245-62827-0001 STARTING OFF AFTER A PUNT TO TEAR BACK THROUGH A BROKEN FIELD THIRTY AND FORTY YARDS AT A CLIP TACKLING AN OPPOSING BACK WITH A DEADLINESS WHICH WAS FINAL NEVER HURT ALWAYS SMILING
3245-62827-0002 A BLOND HEAD OF CURLY HAIR HE NEVER WORE A HEADGUARD FLASHING IN AND OUT ACROSS THE FIELD THE HANDS CLAPPING TOGETHER THE PLAINTIVE VOICE CALLING ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT GIVE ME THE BALL
3245-62827-0003 WHEN A GAME WAS GOING BADLY AND THEN CARRYING IT ALONE TO TOUCHDOWN AFTER TOUCHDOWN ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN ALL OF YALE'S RECENT BIG GAMES WE RECOGNIZED NONE OF THAT EXCEPT THE PLAINTIVE VOICE
3245-62827-0004 MORAL VICTORY WE WAITED TO FIND MISTER MINNIGERODE EXPLAINING THAT OF COURSE HE WAS REFERRING TO THE ANNUAL CONTEST WITH THE SPRINGFIELD TRAINING SCHOOL BUT HE DID NO SUCH THING
3245-62827-0005 AND WENT STRAIGHT AHEAD WITH THE PRETENSE THAT FOOTBALL AT YALE IS ROMANTIC TO BE SURE HE ATTEMPTS TO JUSTIFY THIS ATTITUDE BY LETTING US SEE A GOOD DEAL OF THE GRIDIRON DOINGS THROUGH THE EYES OF A BULL TERRIER
3245-62827-0006 WHO COULD NOT WELL BE EXPECTED TO BE CAPTIOUS CHAMP NAMED AFTER THE YALE CHESS TEAM CAME BY ACCIDENT TO THE FIELD JUST AS CURLY CORLISS WAS OFF ON ONE OF HIS LONG RUNS
3245-62827-0007 YES IT WAS A GAME AGAINST THE SCRUBS SOME ONE CAME TEARING ALONG AND LUNGED AT CURLY AS HE WENT BY APPARENTLY TRYING TO GRAB HIM ABOUT THE LEGS CHAMP CAST ALL CAUTION TO THE WINDS
3245-62827-0008 INTERFERE WITH CURLY WOULD HE WELL CHAMP GUESSED NOT LIKE AN ARROW FROM A BOW CHAMP HURLED HIMSELF THROUGH THE AIR AND FASTENED HIS JAWS FIRMLY IN THE SEAT OF THE OFFENDER'S PANTS
3245-62827-0009 IN A DESPERATE EFFORT TO PREVENT HIM FROM FURTHER MOLESTING CURLY CHAMP WAS IMMEDIATELY ADOPTED BY THE TEAM AS MASCOT IT SEEMS TO US HE DESERVED MORE
3245-62827-0010 HIS ROMANTICISM LIKE THAT OF CHAMP WAS UNDERSTANDABLE HADN'T CURLY CORLISS ONCE SAVED HIS LIFE
3245-62827-0011 JIMMY AS MISTER MINNIGERODE TELLS THE STORY STARTED TO RUN ACROSS THE STREET WITHOUT NOTICING THE STREET CAR LUMBERING AROUND THE CORNER
3245-62827-0012 BUT HE HEARD PEOPLE SHOUTING AND THEN SOMETHING STRUCK HIM AND HE WAS DRAGGED VIOLENTLY AWAY
3245-62827-0013 ONLY THE MAN WHO RESCUED THE NEWSBOY WAS NOT THE FOOTBALL CAPTAIN BUT A SUBSTITUTE ON THE SECOND TEAM WE HAVE FORGOTTEN HIS NAME UNLIKE CORLISS OF YALE
3245-62827-0014 THE HARVARD MAN DID NOT BOTHER TO PICK UP THE NEWSBOY INSTEAD HE SEIZED THE STREET CAR AND THREW IT FOR A LOSS THE FIRST HALF WAS OVER
3245-62827-0015 THINGS LOOKED BLUE FOR YALE NEITHER MASCOT WAS ON HAND YALE WAS TRYING TO WIN WITH NOTHING BUT STUDENTS WHERE WAS LITTLE JIMMY THE NEWSBOY
3245-62827-0016 IF YOU MUST KNOW HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL
3245-62827-0017 THE BOY COULD NOT SEEM TO BREAK HIMSELF OF THE HABIT UNFORTUNATELY HE HAD PICKED OUT THE AFTERNOON OF THE PRINCETON GAME
3245-62827-0018 I'M ALL RIGHT NOW JIMMY TOLD THE DOCTOR HONEST I AM CAN I GO I GOTTA TAKE CHAMP OUT TO THE GAME HE'S THE MASCOT AND THEY CAN'T WIN WITHOUT HIM PLEASE MISTER LET ME GO
3245-62827-0019 IS NOT SO MUCH A COACHING SYSTEM AS A GOOD LEASH TO KEEP THE MASCOTS FROM GETTING RUN OVER CHAMP AND JIMMY RUSHED INTO THE LOCKER ROOM JUST AS THE BIG BLUE TEAM WAS ABOUT TO TROT OUT FOR THE SECOND HALF AFTER THAT
3245-62827-0020 THERE WAS NOTHING TO IT YALE WON BY A SCORE OF TWELVE TO TEN CURLY CLAPPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER WRITES MISTER MINNIGERODE IN DESCRIBING THE RALLY AND KEPT CALLING OUT NEVER MIND THE SIGNAL
3245-62827-0021 GIVE ME THE BALL IN HIS PLAINTIVE VOICE THIS SOUNDS MORE LIKE YALE FOOTBALL THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE BOOK HOWEVER IT SUFFICED
3245-62827-0022 CURLY CORLISS CURLY CORLISS HE WILL LEAVE OLD HARVARD SCORELESS IT IS SAID THAT A LEGEND IS NOW GAINING GROUND IN NEW HAVEN THAT YALE WILL NOT DEFEAT HARVARD AGAIN UNTIL IT IS LED
3245-62827-0023 BY SOME OTHER CAPTAIN WHOSE NAME RHYMES WITH SCORELESS THE CURRENT CAPTAIN OF THE ELIS IS NAMED JORDAN
3245-62827-0024 STILL AS PROFESSOR BILLY PHELPS HAS TAUGHT HIS STUDENTS TO SAY FOOTBALL ISN'T EVERYTHING PERHAPS SOMETHING OF SPARTA HAS GONE FROM YALE FOR A FEW YEARS OR FOREVER
3245-62827-0025 BUT JUST LOOK AT THE YALE POETS AND NOVELISTS ALL OVER THE PLACE THERE IS A NEW
3245-62827-0026 BUT THEY GET OVER IT RIGHT AWAY IT'S JUST LIKE CHANGING INTO A NEW SUIT I EXPECT YEAH I GUESS SO WELL GOO NIGHT LITTLE FELLER
