7569-102232-0000 THE SOCIAL CONDITION OF KENTUCKY HAD CHANGED CONSIDERABLY FROM THE EARLY PIONEER DAYS LIFE HAD ASSUMED A MORE SETTLED AND ORDERLY COURSE THE OLD BARBAROUS EQUALITY OF THE EARLIER TIME WAS GONE
7569-102232-0001 A DIFFERENCE OF CLASSES BEGAN TO BE SEEN THOSE WHO HELD SLAVES ASSUMED A DISTINCT SOCIAL SUPERIORITY OVER THOSE WHO DID NOT THOMAS LINCOLN CONCLUDING THAT KENTUCKY WAS NO COUNTRY FOR A POOR MAN
7569-102232-0002 DETERMINED TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE IN INDIANA HE HAD HEARD OF RICH AND UNOCCUPIED LANDS IN PERRY COUNTY IN THAT STATE AND THITHER HE DETERMINED TO GO HE BUILT A RUDE RAFT LOADED IT WITH HIS KIT OF TOOLS
7569-102232-0003 AND FOUR HUNDRED GALLONS OF WHISKY AND TRUSTED HIS FORTUNES TO THE WINDING WATER COURSES HE MET WITH ONLY ONE ACCIDENT ON HIS WAY HIS RAFT CAPSIZED IN THE OHIO RIVER BUT HE FISHED UP HIS KIT OF TOOLS AND MOST OF THE ARDENT SPIRITS
7569-102232-0004 AND ARRIVED SAFELY AT THE PLACE OF A SETTLER NAMED POSEY WITH WHOM HE LEFT HIS ODD INVOICE OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS FOR THE WILDERNESS WHILE HE STARTED ON FOOT TO LOOK FOR A HOME IN THE DENSE FOREST
7569-102232-0005 HE SELECTED A SPOT WHICH PLEASED HIM IN HIS FIRST DAY'S JOURNEY HE THEN WALKED BACK TO KNOB CREEK AND BROUGHT HIS FAMILY ON TO THEIR NEW HOME NO HUMBLER CAVALCADE EVER INVADED THE INDIANA TIMBER BESIDES HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN
7569-102232-0006 HIS EARTHLY POSSESSIONS WERE OF THE SLIGHTEST FOR THE BACKS OF TWO BORROWED HORSES SUFFICED FOR THE LOAD INSUFFICIENT BEDDING AND CLOTHING A FEW PANS AND KETTLES WERE THEIR SOLE MOVABLE WEALTH
7569-102232-0007 THEY RELIED ON LINCOLN'S KIT OF TOOLS FOR THEIR FURNITURE AND ON HIS RIFLE FOR THEIR FOOD AT POSEY'S THEY HIRED A WAGON AND LITERALLY HEWED A PATH THROUGH THE WILDERNESS TO THEIR NEW HABITATION NEAR LITTLE PIGEON CREEK
7569-102232-0008 A MILE AND A HALF EAST OF GENTRYVILLE IN A RICH AND FERTILE FOREST COUNTRY THOMAS LINCOLN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN BUILT A TEMPORARY SHELTER OF THE SORT CALLED IN THE FRONTIER LANGUAGE
7569-102232-0009 A HALF FACED CAMP MERELY A SHED OF POLES WHICH DEFENDED THE INMATES ON THREE SIDES FROM FOUL WEATHER BUT LEFT THEM OPEN TO ITS INCLEMENCY IN FRONT FOR A WHOLE YEAR HIS FAMILY LIVED IN THIS WRETCHED FOLD
7569-102232-0010 WHILE HE WAS CLEARING A LITTLE PATCH OF GROUND FOR PLANTING CORN AND BUILDING A ROUGH CABIN FOR A PERMANENT RESIDENCE THEY MOVED INTO THE LATTER BEFORE IT WAS HALF COMPLETED FOR BY THIS TIME THE SPARROWS HAD FOLLOWED THE LINCOLNS FROM KENTUCKY
7569-102232-0011 AND THE HALF FACED CAMP WAS GIVEN UP TO THEM BUT THE RUDE CABIN SEEMED SO SPACIOUS AND COMFORTABLE AFTER THE SQUALOR OF THE CAMP THAT THOMAS LINCOLN DID NO FURTHER WORK ON IT FOR A LONG TIME
7569-102232-0012 HE LEFT IT FOR A YEAR OR TWO WITHOUT DOORS OR WINDOWS OR FLOOR THE BATTLE FOR EXISTENCE ALLOWED HIM NO TIME FOR SUCH SUPERFLUITIES HE RAISED ENOUGH CORN TO SUPPORT LIFE
7569-102232-0013 THE OUTSIDE CORNER SUPPORTED BY A CROTCHED STICK DRIVEN INTO THE GROUND THE TABLE A HUGE HEWED LOG STANDING ON FOUR LEGS A POT KETTLE AND SKILLET AND A FEW TIN AND PEWTER DISHES WERE ALL THE FURNITURE
7569-102232-0014 THE BOY ABRAHAM CLIMBED AT NIGHT TO HIS BED OF LEAVES IN THE LOFT BY A LADDER OF WOODEN PINS DRIVEN INTO THE LOGS THIS LIFE HAS BEEN VAUNTED BY POETS AND ROMANCERS AS A HAPPY AND HEALTHFUL ONE
7569-102232-0015 EVEN DENNIS HANKS SPEAKING OF HIS YOUTHFUL DAYS WHEN HIS ONLY HOME WAS THE HALF FACED CAMP SAYS I TELL YOU BILLY I ENJOYED MYSELF BETTER THEN THAN I EVER HAVE SINCE
7569-102232-0016 AND SINGULAR EPIDEMICS FROM TIME TO TIME RAVAGED THE SETTLEMENTS IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN THE LITTLE COMMUNITY OF PIGEON CREEK WAS ALMOST EXTERMINATED BY A FRIGHTFUL PESTILENCE CALLED THE MILK SICKNESS
7569-102232-0017 OR IN THE DIALECT OF THE COUNTRY THE MILK SICK IT IS A MYSTERIOUS DISEASE WHICH HAS BEEN THE THEME OF ENDLESS WRANGLING AMONG WESTERN PHYSICIANS
7569-102232-0018 AND THE DIFFICULTY OF ASCERTAINING ANYTHING ABOUT IT HAS BEEN GREATLY INCREASED BY THE LOCAL SENSITIVENESS WHICH FORBIDS ANY ONE TO ADMIT THAT ANY WELL DEFINED CASE HAS EVER BEEN SEEN IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD ALTHOUGH JUST OVER THE CREEK OR IN THE NEXT COUNTY
7569-102232-0019 AMONG THE PIONEERS OF PIGEON CREEK SO ILL FED ILL HOUSED AND UNCARED FOR THERE WAS LITTLE PROSPECT OF RECOVERY FROM SUCH A GRAVE DISORDER THE SPARROWS HUSBAND AND WIFE
7569-102232-0020 WITH SCANT CEREMONY IN A LITTLE CLEARING OF THE FOREST IT IS RELATED OF YOUNG ABRAHAM THAT HE SORROWED MOST OF ALL THAT HIS MOTHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN LAID AWAY WITH SUCH MAIMED RITES
7569-102232-0021 AND THAT HE CONTRIVED SEVERAL MONTHS LATER TO HAVE A WANDERING PREACHER NAMED DAVID ELKIN BROUGHT TO THE SETTLEMENT TO DELIVER A FUNERAL SERMON OVER HER GRAVE ALREADY WHITE WITH THE EARLY WINTER SNOWS FOOTNOTE
7569-102232-0022 DIED OCTOBER FIFTH A D EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN AGED THIRTY FIVE YEARS ERECTED BY A FRIEND OF HER MARTYRED SON EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE
7569-102232-0023 THIS WAS THE DREARIEST WINTER OF HIS LIFE FOR BEFORE THE NEXT DECEMBER CAME HIS FATHER HAD BROUGHT FROM KENTUCKY A NEW WIFE WHO WAS TO CHANGE THE LOT OF ALL THE DESOLATE LITTLE FAMILY VERY MUCH FOR THE BETTER SARAH BUSH
7569-102232-0024 HAD BEEN AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THOMAS LINCOLN BEFORE HIS FIRST MARRIAGE SHE HAD IT IS SAID REJECTED HIM TO MARRY ONE JOHNSTON THE JAILER AT ELIZABETHTOWN WHO HAD DIED LEAVING HER WITH THREE CHILDREN A BOY AND TWO GIRLS
7569-102232-0025 WHEN LINCOLN'S WIDOWHOOD HAD LASTED A YEAR HE WENT DOWN TO ELIZABETHTOWN TO BEGIN AGAIN THE WOOING BROKEN OFF SO MANY YEARS BEFORE HE WASTED NO TIME IN PRELIMINARIES BUT PROMPTLY MADE HIS WISHES KNOWN
7569-102232-0026 EVEN IN THOSE DISCOURAGING SURROUNDINGS AND THOMAS LINCOLN AND THE CHILDREN WERE THE BETTER FOR HER COMING ALL THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THE LACK OF DOORS AND FLOORS WAS AT ONCE CORRECTED
7569-102232-0027 HER HONEST PRIDE INSPIRED HER HUSBAND TO GREATER THRIFT AND INDUSTRY THE GOODS SHE BROUGHT WITH HER COMPELLED SOME EFFORT AT HARMONY IN THE OTHER FITTINGS OF THE HOUSE SHE DRESSED THE CHILDREN IN WARMER CLOTHING
7569-102232-0028 BUT NO QUALIFICATION WAS EVER REQUIRED OF A TEACHER
7569-102232-0029 IF A STRAGGLER SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND LATIN HAPPENED TO SOJOURN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HE WAS LOOKED UPON AS A WIZARD THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO EXCITE AMBITION FOR EDUCATION
7569-102232-0030 BUT IN THE CASE OF THIS UNGAINLY BOY THERE WAS NO NECESSITY OF ANY EXTERNAL INCENTIVE A THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE AS A MEANS OF RISING IN THE WORLD WAS INNATE IN HIM IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT LOVE OF SCIENCE FOR ITS OWN SAKE
7569-102232-0031 WHICH HAS BEEN SO OFTEN SEEN IN LOWLY SAVANTS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES TO THE PURE DESIRE OF KNOWING THE WORKS OF GOD ALL THE LITTLE LEARNING HE EVER ACQUIRED HE SEIZED AS A TOOL TO BETTER HIS CONDITION
7569-102232-0032 HE LEARNED HIS LETTERS THAT HE MIGHT READ BOOKS AND SEE HOW MEN IN THE GREAT WORLD OUTSIDE OF HIS WOODS HAD BORNE THEMSELVES IN THE FIGHT FOR WHICH HE LONGED HE LEARNED TO WRITE FIRST THAT HE MIGHT HAVE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT HIS PLAYMATES HAD NOT
7569-102232-0033 THEN THAT HE MIGHT HELP HIS ELDERS BY WRITING THEIR LETTERS AND ENJOY THE FEELING OF USEFULNESS WHICH THIS GAVE HIM AND FINALLY THAT HE MIGHT COPY WHAT STRUCK HIM IN HIS READING AND THUS MAKE IT HIS OWN FOR FUTURE USE
