1060-134451-0000 SOPHISTICATION IT WAS EARLY EVENING OF A DAY IN THE LATE FALL AND THE WINESBURG COUNTY FAIR HAD BROUGHT CROWDS OF COUNTRY PEOPLE INTO TOWN THE DAY HAD BEEN CLEAR AND THE NIGHT CAME ON WARM AND PLEASANT
1060-134451-0001 ON THE TRUNION PIKE WHERE THE ROAD AFTER IT LEFT TOWN STRETCHED AWAY BETWEEN BERRY FIELDS NOW COVERED WITH DRY BROWN LEAVES THE DUST FROM PASSING WAGONS AROSE IN CLOUDS CHILDREN CURLED INTO LITTLE BALLS
1060-134451-0002 SLEPT ON THE STRAW SCATTERED ON WAGON BEDS THEIR HAIR WAS FULL OF DUST AND THEIR FINGERS BLACK AND STICKY THE DUST ROLLED AWAY OVER THE FIELDS AND THE DEPARTING SUN SET IT ABLAZE WITH COLORS IN THE MAIN STREET OF WINESBURG
1060-134451-0003 NIGHT CAME ON HORSES WHINNIED
1060-134451-0004 CHILDREN BECAME LOST AND CRIED LUSTILY AN AMERICAN TOWN WORKED TERRIBLY AT THE TASK OF AMUSING ITSELF PUSHING HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWDS IN MAIN STREET YOUNG GEORGE WILLARD CONCEALED HIMSELF IN THE STAIRWAY LEADING TO DOCTOR REEFY'S OFFICE
1060-134451-0005 AND LOOKED AT THE PEOPLE WITH FEVERISH EYES HE WATCHED THE FACES DRIFTING PAST UNDER THE STORE LIGHTS THOUGHTS KEPT COMING INTO HIS HEAD AND HE DID NOT WANT TO THINK HE STAMPED IMPATIENTLY ON THE WOODEN STEPS
1060-134451-0006 AND LOOKED SHARPLY ABOUT WELL IS SHE GOING TO STAY WITH HIM ALL DAY HAVE I DONE ALL THIS WAITING FOR NOTHING HE MUTTERED GEORGE WILLARD THE OHIO VILLAGE BOY WAS FAST GROWING INTO MANHOOD
1060-134451-0007 AND NEW THOUGHTS HAD BEEN COMING INTO HIS MIND ALL THAT DAY
1060-134451-0008 HE HAD GONE ABOUT FEELING LONELY HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE WINESBURG
1060-134451-0009 AND HE FELT GROWN UP THE MOOD THAT HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM WAS A THING KNOWN TO MEN AND UNKNOWN TO BOYS HE FELT OLD AND A LITTLE TIRED
1060-134451-0010 MEMORIES AWOKE IN HIM TO HIS MIND HIS NEW SENSE OF MATURITY SET HIM APART MADE OF HIM A HALF TRAGIC FIGURE HE WANTED SOMEONE TO UNDERSTAND THE FEELING
1060-134451-0011 THERE IS A TIME IN THE LIFE OF EVERY BOY WHEN HE FOR THE FIRST TIME TAKES THE BACKWARD VIEW OF LIFE PERHAPS THAT IS THE MOMENT WHEN HE CROSSES THE LINE INTO MANHOOD THE BOY IS WALKING THROUGH THE STREET OF HIS TOWN
1060-134451-0012 HE IS THINKING OF THE FUTURE AND OF THE FIGURE HE WILL CUT IN THE WORLD AMBITIONS AND REGRETS AWAKE WITHIN HIM SUDDENLY SOMETHING HAPPENS HE STOPS UNDER A TREE
1060-134451-0013 AND WAITS AS FOR A VOICE CALLING HIS NAME GHOSTS OF OLD THINGS CREEP INTO HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THE VOICES OUTSIDE OF HIMSELF WHISPER A MESSAGE CONCERNING THE LIMITATIONS OF LIFE
1060-134451-0014 FROM BEING QUITE SURE OF HIMSELF AND HIS FUTURE HE BECOMES NOT AT ALL SURE IF HE BE AN IMAGINATIVE BOY A DOOR IS TORN OPEN AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE LOOKS OUT UPON THE WORLD
1060-134451-0015 SEEING AS THOUGH THEY MARCHED IN PROCESSION BEFORE HIM THE COUNTLESS FIGURES OF MEN WHO BEFORE HIS TIME HAVE COME OUT OF NOTHINGNESS INTO THE WORLD LIVED THEIR LIVES AND AGAIN DISAPPEARED INTO NOTHINGNESS
1060-134451-0016 THE SADNESS OF SOPHISTICATION HAS COME TO THE BOY WITH A LITTLE GASP HE SEES HIMSELF AS MERELY A LEAF BLOWN BY THE WIND THROUGH THE STREETS OF HIS VILLAGE HE KNOWS THAT IN SPITE OF ALL THE STOUT TALK OF HIS FELLOWS
1060-134451-0017 HE MUST LIVE AND DIE IN UNCERTAINTY A THING BLOWN BY THE WINDS A THING DESTINED LIKE CORN TO WILT IN THE SUN HE SHIVERS AND LOOKS EAGERLY ABOUT THE EIGHTEEN YEARS HE HAS LIVED SEEM BUT A MOMENT
1060-134451-0018 ALREADY HE HEARS DEATH CALLING WITH ALL HIS HEART HE WANTS TO COME CLOSE TO SOME OTHER HUMAN TOUCH SOMEONE WITH HIS HANDS BE TOUCHED BY THE HAND OF ANOTHER IF HE PREFERS THAT THE OTHER BE A WOMAN
1060-134451-0019 THAT IS BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT A WOMAN WILL BE GENTLE THAT SHE WILL UNDERSTAND HE WANTS MOST OF ALL UNDERSTANDING WHEN THE MOMENT OF SOPHISTICATION CAME TO GEORGE WILLARD
1060-134451-0020 HIS MIND TURNED TO HELEN WHITE THE WINESBURG BANKER'S DAUGHTER ALWAYS HE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF THE GIRL GROWING INTO WOMANHOOD AS HE GREW INTO MANHOOD ONCE ON A SUMMER NIGHT WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN
1060-134451-0021 HE HAD WALKED WITH HER ON A COUNTRY ROAD AND IN HER PRESENCE HAD GIVEN WAY TO AN IMPULSE TO BOAST TO MAKE HIMSELF APPEAR BIG AND SIGNIFICANT IN HER EYES NOW HE WANTED TO SEE HER FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE
1060-134451-0022 HE HAD TRIED TO MAKE HER THINK OF HIM AS A MAN WHEN HE KNEW NOTHING OF MANHOOD AND NOW HE WANTED TO BE WITH HER AND TO TRY TO MAKE HER FEEL THE CHANGE HE BELIEVED HAD TAKEN PLACE IN HIS NATURE AS FOR HELEN WHITE
1060-134451-0023 SHE ALSO HAD COME TO A PERIOD OF CHANGE WHAT GEORGE FELT SHE IN HER YOUNG WOMAN'S WAY FELT ALSO SHE WAS NO LONGER A GIRL AND HUNGERED TO REACH INTO THE GRACE AND BEAUTY OF WOMANHOOD
1060-134451-0024 SHE HAD COME HOME FROM CLEVELAND WHERE SHE WAS ATTENDING COLLEGE TO SPEND A DAY AT THE FAIR SHE ALSO HAD BEGUN TO HAVE MEMORIES DURING THE DAY SHE SAT IN THE GRAND STAND WITH A YOUNG MAN
1060-134451-0025 ONE OF THE INSTRUCTORS FROM THE COLLEGE WHO WAS A GUEST OF HER MOTHER'S THE YOUNG MAN WAS OF A PEDANTIC TURN OF MIND AND SHE FELT AT ONCE HE WOULD NOT DO FOR HER PURPOSE AT THE FAIR SHE WAS GLAD TO BE SEEN IN HIS COMPANY
1060-134451-0026 AS HE WAS WELL DRESSED AND A STRANGER SHE KNEW THAT THE FACT OF HIS PRESENCE WOULD CREATE AN IMPRESSION DURING THE DAY SHE WAS HAPPY BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME ON SHE BEGAN TO GROW RESTLESS
1060-134451-0027 SHE WANTED TO DRIVE THE INSTRUCTOR AWAY TO GET OUT OF HIS PRESENCE WHILE THEY SAT TOGETHER IN THE GRAND STAND AND WHILE THE EYES OF FORMER SCHOOLMATES WERE UPON THEM SHE PAID SO MUCH ATTENTION TO HER ESCORT
1060-134451-0028 THAT HE GREW INTERESTED A SCHOLAR NEEDS MONEY I SHOULD MARRY A WOMAN WITH MONEY HE MUSED HELEN WHITE WAS THINKING OF GEORGE WILLARD EVEN AS HE WANDERED GLOOMILY THROUGH THE CROWDS THINKING OF HER
1060-134451-0029 SHE REMEMBERED THE SUMMER EVENING WHEN THEY HAD WALKED TOGETHER AND WANTED TO WALK WITH HIM AGAIN SHE THOUGHT THAT THE MONTHS SHE HAD SPENT IN THE CITY
1060-134451-0030 HAD CHANGED HER PROFOUNDLY SHE WANTED HIM TO FEEL AND BE CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE IN HER NATURE THE SUMMER EVENING TOGETHER THAT HAD LEFT ITS MARK ON THE MEMORY OF BOTH THE YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN HAD
1060-134451-0031 WHEN LOOKED AT QUITE SENSIBLY BEEN RATHER STUPIDLY SPENT

1060-134451-0034 THE CONFUSED BOY PUT HIS HAND ON THE GIRL'S ARM HIS VOICE TREMBLED THE TWO STARTED TO WALK BACK ALONG THE ROAD TOWARD TOWN IN HIS DESPERATION GEORGE BOASTED
1060-134451-0035 HE DECLARED I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERHAPS IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS I WANT YOU TO TRY TO BE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WOMEN YOU SEE THE POINT IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS I TELL YOU I WANT YOU TO BE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
1060-134451-0036 YOU SEE WHAT I WANT THE BOY'S VOICE FAILED AND IN SILENCE THE TWO CAME BACK INTO TOWN AND WENT ALONG THE STREET TO HELEN WHITE'S HOUSE AT THE GATE HE TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING IMPRESSIVE
1060-134451-0037 SPEECHES HE HAD THOUGHT OUT CAME INTO HIS HEAD BUT THEY SEEMED UTTERLY POINTLESS I THOUGHT I USED TO THINK I HAD IT IN MY MIND YOU WOULD MARRY SETH RICHMOND
1060-134451-0038 NOW I KNOW YOU WON'T WAS ALL HE COULD FIND TO SAY
1060-134451-0039 AND TOWARD THE DOOR OF HER HOUSE ON THE WARM FALL EVENING AS HE STOOD IN THE STAIRWAY AND LOOKED AT THE CROWD DRIFTING THROUGH MAIN STREET GEORGE THOUGHT OF THE TALK BESIDE THE FIELD OF YOUNG CORN
1060-134451-0040 AND WAS ASHAMED OF THE FIGURE HE HAD MADE OF HIMSELF IN THE STREET THE PEOPLE SURGED UP AND DOWN LIKE CATTLE CONFINED IN A PEN BUGGIES AND WAGONS ALMOST FILLED THE NARROW THOROUGHFARE A BAND PLAYED
1060-134451-0041 AND SMALL BOYS RACED ALONG THE SIDEWALK DIVING BETWEEN THE LEGS OF MEN YOUNG MEN WITH SHINING RED FACES WALKED AWKWARDLY ABOUT WITH GIRLS ON THEIR ARMS IN A ROOM ABOVE ONE OF THE STORES WHERE A DANCE WAS TO BE HELD
1060-134451-0042 THE FIDDLERS TUNED THEIR INSTRUMENTS THE BROKEN SOUNDS FLOATED DOWN THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW AND OUT ACROSS THE MURMUR OF VOICES
1060-134451-0043 EVERYWHERE ON ALL SIDES THE SENSE OF CROWDING MOVING LIFE CLOSED IN ABOUT HIM HE WANTED TO RUN AWAY BY HIMSELF AND THINK IF SHE WANTS TO STAY WITH THAT FELLOW SHE MAY
1060-134451-0044 WHY SHOULD I CARE WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE TO ME HE GROWLED AND WENT ALONG MAIN STREET AND THROUGH HERN'S GROCERY INTO A SIDE STREET GEORGE FELT SO UTTERLY LONELY AND DEJECTED
1060-134451-0045 THAT HE WANTED TO WEEP BUT PRIDE MADE HIM WALK RAPIDLY ALONG SWINGING HIS ARMS HE CAME TO WESLEY MOYER'S LIVERY BARN AND STOPPED IN THE SHADOWS TO LISTEN TO A GROUP OF MEN WHO TALKED OF A RACE WESLEY'S STALLION TONY TIP
1060-134451-0046 HAD WON AT THE FAIR DURING THE AFTERNOON A CROWD HAD GATHERED IN FRONT OF THE BARN AND BEFORE THE CROWD WALKED WESLEY PRANCING UP AND DOWN BOASTING

1060-134451-0050 WITH A PIN HE MENDED THE TORN PLACE AND THEN AROSE AND WENT ON I'LL GO TO HELEN WHITE'S HOUSE THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO I'LL WALK RIGHT IN
1060-134451-0051 I'LL WALK RIGHT IN AND SIT DOWN THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO HE DECLARED CLIMBING OVER A FENCE AND BEGINNING TO RUN ON THE VERANDA OF BANKER WHITE'S HOUSE
1060-134451-0052 HELEN WAS RESTLESS AND DISTRAUGHT THE INSTRUCTOR SAT BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER HIS TALK WEARIED THE GIRL
1060-134451-0053 THE INSTRUCTOR BEGAN TO PUT ON THE AIRS OF THE CITY HE WANTED TO APPEAR COSMOPOLITAN I LIKE THE CHANCE YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TO STUDY THE BACKGROUND OUT OF WHICH MOST OF OUR GIRLS COME HE DECLARED
1060-134451-0054 IT WAS GOOD OF YOU MISSUS WHITE TO HAVE ME DOWN FOR THE DAY HE TURNED TO HELEN AND LAUGHED YOUR LIFE IS STILL BOUND UP WITH THE LIFE OF THIS TOWN HE ASKED
1060-134451-0055 THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE IN WHOM YOU ARE INTERESTED TO THE GIRL HIS VOICE SOUNDED POMPOUS AND HEAVY HELEN AROSE AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE
1060-134451-0056 AT THE DOOR LEADING TO A GARDEN AT THE BACK SHE STOPPED AND STOOD LISTENING HER MOTHER BEGAN TO TALK THERE IS NO ONE HERE FIT TO ASSOCIATE WITH A GIRL OF HELEN'S BREEDING SHE SAID
1060-134451-0057 HELEN RAN DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND INTO THE GARDEN IN THE DARKNESS SHE STOPPED AND STOOD TREMBLING IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THE WORLD WAS FULL OF MEANINGLESS PEOPLE SAYING WORDS
1060-134451-0058 AFIRE WITH EAGERNESS SHE RAN THROUGH A GARDEN GATE AND TURNING A CORNER BY THE BANKER'S BARN WENT INTO A LITTLE SIDE STREET GEORGE WHERE ARE YOU GEORGE SHE CRIED FILLED WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT
1060-134451-0059 SHE STOPPED RUNNING AND LEANED AGAINST A TREE TO LAUGH HYSTERICALLY ALONG THE DARK LITTLE STREET CAME GEORGE WILLARD STILL SAYING WORDS
1060-134451-0060 I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SIT DOWN HE DECLARED AS HE CAME UP TO HER HE STOPPED AND STARED STUPIDLY COME ON HE SAID AND TOOK HOLD OF HER HAND
1060-134451-0061 WITH HANGING HEADS THEY WALKED AWAY ALONG THE STREET UNDER THE TREES DRY LEAVES RUSTLED UNDER FOOT NOW THAT HE HAD FOUND HER GEORGE WONDERED WHAT HE HAD BETTER DO AND SAY
1060-134451-0062 AT THE UPPER END OF THE FAIR GROUND IN WINESBURG THERE IS A HALF DECAYED OLD GRAND STAND
1060-134451-0063 AND THE BOARDS ARE ALL WARPED OUT OF SHAPE THE FAIR GROUND STANDS ON TOP OF A LOW HILL RISING OUT OF THE VALLEY OF WINE CREEK AND FROM THE GRAND STAND ONE CAN SEE AT NIGHT OVER A CORNFIELD THE LIGHTS OF THE TOWN REFLECTED AGAINST THE SKY
1060-134451-0064 GEORGE AND HELEN CLIMBED THE HILL TO THE FAIR GROUND COMING BY THE PATH PAST WATERWORKS POND
1060-134451-0065 WAS BOTH BROKEN AND INTENSIFIED BY THE PRESENCE OF HELEN WHAT HE FELT WAS REFLECTED IN HER IN YOUTH THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO FORCES FIGHTING IN PEOPLE
1060-134451-0066 THE WARM UNTHINKING LITTLE ANIMAL STRUGGLES AGAINST THE THING THAT REFLECTS AND REMEMBERS AND THE OLDER THE MORE SOPHISTICATED THING
1060-134451-0067 SENSING HIS MOOD HELEN WALKED BESIDE HIM FILLED WITH RESPECT WHEN THEY GOT TO THE GRAND STAND THEY CLIMBED UP UNDER THE ROOF AND SAT DOWN ON ONE OF THE LONG BENCH LIKE SEATS
1060-134451-0068 THERE IS SOMETHING MEMORABLE IN THE EXPERIENCE TO BE HAD BY GOING INTO A FAIR GROUND THAT STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A MIDDLE WESTERN TOWN
1060-134451-0069 THE SENSATION IS ONE NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN ON ALL SIDES ARE GHOSTS NOT OF THE DEAD BUT OF LIVING PEOPLE HERE
1060-134451-0070 DURING THE DAY JUST PASSED HAVE COME THE PEOPLE POURING IN FROM THE TOWN AND THE COUNTRY AROUND FARMERS WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN
1060-134451-0071 HAVE GATHERED WITHIN THESE BOARD WALLS YOUNG GIRLS HAVE LAUGHED AND MEN WITH BEARDS HAVE TALKED OF THE AFFAIRS OF THEIR LIVES THE PLACE HAS BEEN FILLED TO OVERFLOWING WITH LIFE
1060-134451-0072 AND NOW IT IS NIGHT AND THE LIFE HAS ALL GONE AWAY THE SILENCE IS ALMOST TERRIFYING ONE CONCEALS ONESELF STANDING SILENTLY BESIDE THE TRUNK OF A TREE
1060-134451-0073 AND WHAT THERE IS OF A REFLECTIVE TENDENCY IN HIS NATURE IS INTENSIFIED ONE SHUDDERS AT THE THOUGHT OF THE MEANINGLESSNESS OF LIFE
1060-134451-0074 AND IF THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN ARE HIS PEOPLE ONE LOVES LIFE SO INTENSELY THAT TEARS COME INTO THE EYES IN THE DARKNESS UNDER THE ROOF OF THE GRAND STAND
1060-134451-0075 GEORGE WILLARD SAT BESIDE HELEN WHITE
1060-134451-0076 NOW THAT HE HAD COME OUT OF TOWN WHERE THE PRESENCE OF THE PEOPLE STIRRING ABOUT BUSY WITH A MULTITUDE OF AFFAIRS HAD BEEN SO IRRITATING THE IRRITATION WAS ALL GONE
1060-134451-0077 THE PRESENCE OF HELEN RENEWED AND REFRESHED HIM IT WAS AS THOUGH HER WOMAN'S HAND WAS ASSISTING HIM TO MAKE SOME MINUTE READJUSTMENT OF THE MACHINERY OF HIS LIFE
1060-134451-0078 HE HAD REVERENCE FOR HELEN
1060-134451-0079 BUT HE DID NOT WANT AT THE MOMENT TO BE CONFUSED BY HER WOMANHOOD IN THE DARKNESS HE TOOK HOLD OF HER HAND AND WHEN SHE CREPT CLOSE PUT A HAND ON HER SHOULDER A WIND BEGAN TO BLOW
1060-134451-0080 AND HE SHIVERED WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH
1060-134451-0081 IN THAT HIGH PLACE IN THE DARKNESS THE TWO ODDLY SENSITIVE HUMAN ATOMS HELD EACH OTHER TIGHTLY AND WAITED IN THE MIND OF EACH WAS THE SAME THOUGHT I HAVE COME TO THIS LONELY PLACE
1060-134451-0082 WAS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE THING FELT IN WINESBURG
1060-134451-0083 FARM HORSES JOGGED AWAY ALONG LONELY COUNTRY ROADS PULLING THEIR PORTION OF WEARY PEOPLE CLERKS BEGAN TO BRING SAMPLES OF GOODS IN OFF THE SIDEWALKS AND LOCK THE DOORS OF STORES IN THE OPERA HOUSE
1060-134451-0084 A CROWD HAD GATHERED TO SEE A SHOW AND FURTHER DOWN MAIN STREET THE FIDDLERS THEIR INSTRUMENTS TUNED SWEATED AND WORKED TO KEEP THE FEET OF YOUTH FLYING OVER A DANCE FLOOR
1060-134451-0085 HELEN WHITE AND GEORGE WILLARD REMAINED SILENT NOW AND THEN THE SPELL THAT HELD THEM WAS BROKEN AND THEY TURNED AND TRIED IN THE DIM LIGHT TO SEE INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
1060-134451-0086 THEY KISSED BUT THAT IMPULSE DID NOT LAST AT THE UPPER END OF THE FAIR GROUND A HALF DOZEN MEN WORKED OVER HORSES THAT HAD RACED DURING THE AFTERNOON THE MEN HAD BUILT A FIRE AND WERE HEATING KETTLES OF WATER
1060-134451-0087 ONLY THEIR LEGS COULD BE SEEN AS THEY PASSED BACK AND FORTH IN THE LIGHT WHEN THE WIND BLEW THE LITTLE FLAMES OF THE FIRE DANCED CRAZILY ABOUT
1060-134451-0088 GEORGE AND HELEN AROSE AND WALKED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS THEY WENT ALONG A PATH PAST A FIELD OF CORN THAT HAD NOT YET BEEN CUT THE WIND WHISPERED
1060-134451-0089 AMONG THE DRY CORN BLADES FOR A MOMENT DURING THE WALK BACK INTO TOWN THE SPELL THAT HELD THEM WAS BROKEN WHEN THEY HAD COME TO THE CREST OF WATERWORKS HILL
1060-134451-0090 THEY STOPPED BY A TREE AND GEORGE AGAIN PUT HIS HANDS ON THE GIRL'S SHOULDERS SHE EMBRACED HIM EAGERLY
1060-134451-0091 THEY STOPPED KISSING AND STOOD A LITTLE APART MUTUAL RESPECT GREW BIG IN THEM THEY WERE BOTH EMBARRASSED AND TO RELIEVE THEIR EMBARRASSMENT DROPPED INTO THE ANIMALISM OF YOUTH
1060-134451-0092 THEY LAUGHED AND BEGAN TO PULL AND HAUL AT EACH OTHER IN SOME WAY CHASTENED AND PURIFIED BY THE MOOD THEY HAD BEEN IN THEY BECAME NOT MAN AND WOMAN NOT BOY AND GIRL BUT EXCITED LITTLE ANIMALS
1060-134451-0093 IT WAS SO THEY WENT DOWN THE HILL IN THE DARKNESS THEY PLAYED LIKE TWO SPLENDID YOUNG THINGS IN A YOUNG WORLD ONCE RUNNING SWIFTLY FORWARD HELEN TRIPPED GEORGE AND HE FELL
1060-134451-0094 HE SQUIRMED AND SHOUTED SHAKING WITH LAUGHTER HE ROILED DOWN THE HILL HELEN RAN AFTER HIM FOR JUST A MOMENT SHE STOPPED IN THE DARKNESS
1060-134451-0095 THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT WOMAN'S THOUGHTS WENT THROUGH HER MIND BUT WHEN THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL WAS REACHED AND SHE CAME UP TO THE BOY SHE TOOK HIS ARM AND WALKED BESIDE HIM IN DIGNIFIED SILENCE
1060-134451-0096 MAN OR BOY
