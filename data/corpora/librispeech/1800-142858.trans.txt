1800-142858-0000 BAD FEEDING OR BAD GROOMING IT IS THEREFORE A POINT OF HUMANITY NOT TO SPEAK OF ITS OBVIOUS IMPOLICY FOR THE OWNER OF HORSES TO OVERLOOK ANY NEGLECT IN THEIR FEEDING OR GROOMING
1800-142858-0001 HIS INTEREST DICTATES THAT SO VALUABLE AN ANIMAL SHOULD BE WELL HOUSED WELL FED AND WELL GROOMED AND HE WILL DO WELL TO ACQUIRE SO MUCH OF STABLE LORE AS WILL ENABLE HIM TO JUDGE OF THESE POINTS HIMSELF
1800-142858-0002 IN A GENERAL WAY WHERE A HORSE'S COAT IS HABITUALLY ROUGH AND UNTIDY THERE IS A SAD WANT OF ELBOW GREASE IN THE STABLE WHEN A HORSE OF TOLERABLE BREEDING IS DULL AND SPIRITLESS HE IS GETTING ILL OR BADLY FED
1800-142858-0003 STABLES THE ARCHITECTURAL FORM OF THE STABLES WILL BE SUBJECT TO OTHER INFLUENCES THAN OURS WE CONFINE OURSELVES THEREFORE TO THEIR INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS THEY SHOULD BE ROOMY IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF STALLS
1800-142858-0004 WARM WITH GOOD VENTILATION AND PERFECTLY FREE FROM COLD DRAUGHTS THE STALLS ROOMY WITHOUT EXCESS WITH GOOD AND WELL TRAPPED DRAINAGE SO AS TO EXCLUDE BAD SMELLS
1800-142858-0005 A SOUND CEILING TO PREVENT THE ENTRANCE OF DUST FROM THE HAYLOFT WHICH IS USUALLY ABOVE THEM AND THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF LIGHT COMING HOWEVER EITHER FROM ABOVE OR BEHIND
1800-142858-0006 ALTHOUGH SOME GROOMS INSIST ON A MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURE
1800-142858-0007 VENTILATION IS USUALLY ATTAINED BY THE INSERTION OF ONE OR MORE TUBES OR BOXES OF WOOD OR IRON THROUGH THE CEILING AND THE ROOF WITH A SLOPING COVERING OVER THE OPENING TO KEEP OUT RAIN
1800-142858-0008 AND VALVES OR VENTILATORS BELOW TO REGULATE THE ATMOSPHERE WITH OPENINGS IN THE WALLS FOR THE ADMISSION OF FRESH AIR THIS IS STILL A DIFFICULTY HOWEVER FOR THE EFFLUVIUM OF THE STABLE IS DIFFICULT TO DISPEL AND DRAUGHTS MUST BE AVOIDED
1800-142858-0009 THIS IS SOMETIMES ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF HOLLOW WALLS WITH GRATINGS AT THE BOTTOM OUTSIDE FOR THE EXIT OF BAD AIR WHICH IS CARRIED DOWN THROUGH THE HOLLOW WALLS AND DISCHARGED AT THE BOTTOM WHILE FOR THE ADMISSION OF FRESH AIR THE REVERSE TAKES PLACE
1800-142858-0010 A HAY RACK PLACED WITHIN EASY REACH OF THE HORSE OF WOOD OR IRON OCCUPIES EITHER A CORNER OR THE WHOLE BREADTH OF THE STALL WHICH SHOULD BE ABOUT SIX FEET FOR ON ORDINARY SIZED HORSE A MANGER
1800-142858-0011 FORMERLY OF WOOD BUT OF LATE YEARS MORE GENERALLY OF IRON LINED WITH ENAMEL OCCUPIES A CORNER OF THE STALL THE PAVEMENT OF THE STALL SHOULD BE NEARLY LEVEL WITH A SLIGHT INCLINE TOWARDS THE GUTTER TO KEEP THE BED DRY
1800-142858-0012 PAVED WITH HARD DUTCH BRICK LAID ON EDGE OR ASPHALTE OR SMITHY CLINKERS OR RUBBLE STONES LAID IN STRONG CEMENT IN THE CENTRE ABOUT FIVE FEET FROM THE WALL
1800-142858-0013 A GRATING SHOULD BE FIRMLY FIXED IN THE PAVEMENT AND IN COMMUNICATION WITH A WELL TRAPPED DRAIN TO CARRY OFF THE WATER THE GUTTER OUTSIDE THE STALL SHOULD ALSO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DRAINS BY TRAPPED OPENINGS
1800-142858-0014 THE PASSAGE BETWEEN THE STALL AND THE HALL SHOULD BE FROM FIVE TO SIX FEET BROAD AT LEAST ON THE WALL OPPOSITE TO EACH STALL
1800-142858-0015 A HARNESS ROOM IS INDISPENSABLE TO EVERY STABLE IT SHOULD BE DRY AND AIRY AND FURNISHED WITH A FIREPLACE AND BOILER BOTH FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE HARNESS
1800-142858-0016 AND TO PREPARE MASHES FOR THE HORSES WHEN REQUIRED THE PARTITION WALL SHOULD BE BOARDED WHERE THE HARNESS GOES WITH PEGS TO HANG THE VARIOUS PIECES OF HARNESS ON WITH SADDLE TREES TO REST THE SADDLES ON
1800-142858-0017 THE FURNITURE OF A STABLE WITH COACHHOUSE CONSISTS OF COACH MOPS JACKS FOR RAISING THE WHEELS HORSE BRUSHES SPOKE BRUSHES WATER BRUSHES CREST AND BIT BRUSHES
1800-142858-0018 DANDY BRUSHES CURRYCOMBS BIRCH AND HEATH BROOMS TRIMMING COMBS SCISSORS AND PICKERS OIL CANS AND BRUSHES HARNESS BRUSHES OF THREE SORTS LEATHERS
1800-142858-0019 SPONGES FOR HORSE AND CARRIAGE STABLE FORKS DUNG BASKETS OR WHEELBARROW CORN SIEVES AND MEASURES HORSE CLOTHS AND STABLE PAILS HORN OR GLASS LANTERNS
1800-142858-0020 OVER THE STABLES THERE SHOULD BE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE COACHMAN OR GROOM TO SLEEP ACCIDENTS SOMETIMES OCCUR AND HE SHOULD BE AT HAND TO INTERFERE
1800-142858-0021 THE ESTABLISHMENT WE HAVE IN VIEW WILL CONSIST OF COACHMAN GROOM AND STABLE BOY WHO ARE CAPABLE OF KEEPING IN PERFECT ORDER FOUR HORSES AND PERHAPS THE PONY OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT THE COACHMAN IS CHIEF
1800-142858-0022 BESIDES SKILL IN DRIVING HE SHOULD POSSESS A GOOD GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF HORSES HE HAS USUALLY TO PURCHASE PROVENDER TO SEE THAT THE HORSES ARE REGULARLY FED AND PROPERLY GROOMED WATCH OVER THEIR CONDITION
1800-142858-0023 APPLY SIMPLE REMEDIES TO TRIFLING AILMENTS IN THE ANIMALS UNDER HIS CHARGE AND REPORT WHERE HE OBSERVES SYMPTOMS OF MORE SERIOUS ONES WHICH HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HE HAS EITHER TO CLEAN THE CARRIAGE HIMSELF
1800-142858-0024 THE GROOM'S FIRST DUTIES ARE TO KEEP HIS HORSES IN CONDITION BUT HE IS SOMETIMES EXPECTED TO PERFORM THE DUTIES OF A VALET TO RIDE OUT WITH HIS MASTER ON OCCASIONS TO WAIT AT TABLE AND OTHERWISE ASSIST IN THE HOUSE
1800-142858-0025 IN THESE CASES HE SHOULD HAVE THE MEANS OF DRESSING HIMSELF AND KEEPING HIS CLOTHES ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE STABLES IN THE MORNING ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK OR RATHER BEFORE
1800-142858-0026 THE STABLES SHOULD BE OPENED AND CLEANED OUT AND THE HORSES FED FIRST BY CLEANING THE RACK AND THROWING IN FRESH HAY PUTTING IT LIGHTLY IN THE RACK THAT THE HORSES MAY GET IT OUT EASILY
1800-142858-0027 A SHORT TIME AFTERWARDS THEIR USUAL MORNING FEED OF OATS SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE MANGER WHILE THIS IS GOING ON THE STABLE BOY HAS BEEN REMOVING THE STABLE DUNG AND SWEEPING AND WASHING OUT THE STABLES
1800-142858-0028 BOTH OF WHICH SHOULD BE DONE EVERY DAY AND EVERY CORNER CAREFULLY SWEPT IN ORDER TO KEEP THE STABLE SWEET AND CLEAN THE REAL DUTIES OF THE GROOM FOLLOW WHERE THE HORSES ARE NOT TAKEN OUT FOR EARLY EXERCISE
1800-142858-0029 AND CURRY HIM BEFORE ON HIS BREAST AND LAYING YOUR RIGHT ARM OVER HIS BACK JOIN YOUR RIGHT SIDE TO HIS LEFT AND CURRY HIM ALL UNDER THE BELLY NEAR THE FORE BOWELS
1800-142858-0030 AND SO ALL OVER FROM THE KNEES AND BACK UPWARDS AFTER THAT GO TO THE FAR SIDE AND DO THAT LIKEWISE THEN TAKE A DEAD HORSE'S TAIL OR FAILING THAT A COTTON DUSTING CLOTH
1800-142858-0031 BY A HAIR CLOTH WITH WHICH RUB HIM ALL OVER AGAIN VERY HARD BOTH TO TAKE AWAY LOOSE HAIRS AND LAY HIS COAT THEN WASH YOUR HANDS IN FAIR WATER AND RUB HIM
1800-142858-0032 AND RUB ALL HIS LEGS EXCEEDING WELL FROM THE KNEES AND HOCKS DOWNWARDS TO HIS HOOFS PICKING AND DRESSING THEM VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THE FETLOCKS
1800-142858-0033 SO AS TO REMOVE ALL GRAVEL AND DUST WHICH WILL SOMETIMES LIE IN THE BENDING OF THE JOINTS IN ADDITION TO THE PRACTICE OF THIS OLD WRITER MODERN GROOMS ADD WISPING WHICH USUALLY FOLLOWS BRUSHING
1800-142858-0034 THE BEST WISP IS MADE FROM A HAYBAND UNTWISTED AND AGAIN DOUBLED UP AFTER BEING MOISTENED WITH WATER THIS IS APPLIED TO EVERY PART OF THE BODY AS THE BRUSHING HAD BEEN
1800-142858-0035 BY CHANGING THE HANDS TAKING CARE IN ALL THESE OPERATIONS TO CARRY THE HAND IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COAT STAINS ON THE HAIR ARE REMOVED BY SPONGING OR WHEN THE COAT IS VERY DIRTY BY THE WATER BRUSH
1800-142858-0036 THE HORSECLOTH SHOULD NOW BE PUT ON BY TAKING THE CLOTH IN BOTH HANDS WITH THE OUTSIDE NEXT YOU AND WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND TO THE OFF SIDE THROW IT OVER HIS BACK
1800-142858-0037 PLACING IT NO FARTHER BACK THAN WILL LEAVE IT STRAIGHT AND LEVEL WHICH WILL BE ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE TAIL PUT THE ROLLER ROUND AND THE PAD PIECE UNDER IT ABOUT SIX OR EIGHT INCHES FROM THE FORE LEGS
1800-142858-0038 WATERING USUALLY FOLLOWS DRESSING BUT SOME HORSES REFUSE THEIR FOOD UNTIL THEY HAVE DRUNK THE GROOM SHOULD NOT THEREFORE LAY DOWN EXCLUSIVE RULES ON THIS SUBJECT
1800-142858-0039 EXERCISE ALL HORSES NOT IN WORK REQUIRE AT LEAST TWO HOURS EXERCISE DAILY AND IN EXERCISING THEM A GOOD GROOM WILL PUT THEM THROUGH THE PACES TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED
1800-142858-0040 IN THE CASE OF SADDLE HORSES HE WILL WALK TROT CANTER AND GALLOP THEM IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM UP TO THEIR WORK WITH DRAUGHT HORSES
1800-142858-0041 FEEDING MUST DEPEND ON THEIR WORK BUT THEY REQUIRE FEEDING THREE TIMES A DAY WITH MORE OR LESS CORN EACH TIME ACCORDING TO THEIR WORK IN THE FAST COACHING DAYS IT WAS A SAYING AMONG PROPRIETORS THAT
1800-142858-0042 HIS BELLY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS FOOD BUT THE HORSE'S APPETITE IS NOT TO BE TAKEN AS A CRITERION OF THE QUANTITY OF FOOD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
1800-142858-0043 MIXED UP TOGETHER UNDER THIS THE HORSES DID THEIR WORK WELL
1800-142858-0044 TWICE A DAY A THIRD FEED AND A RACK FULL OF HAY
1800-142858-0045 YOU CANNOT TAKE UP A PAPER WITHOUT HAVING THE QUESTION PUT DO YOU BRUISE YOUR OATS WELL THAT DEPENDS ON CIRCUMSTANCES A FRESH YOUNG HORSE CAN BRUISE ITS OWN OATS WHEN IT CAN GET THEM
1800-142858-0046 BUT AGED HORSES AFTER A TIME LOSE THE POWER OF MASTICATING AND BRUISING THEM AND BOLT THEM WHOLE THUS MUCH IMPEDING THE WORK OF DIGESTION FOR AN OLD HORSE THEN BRUISE THE OATS
1800-142858-0047 FOR A YOUNG ONE IT DOES NO HARM AND LITTLE GOOD OATS SHOULD BE BRIGHT AND DRY AND NOT TOO NEW WHERE THEY ARE NEW SPRINKLE THEM WITH SALT AND WATER OTHERWISE THEY OVERLOAD THE HORSE'S STOMACH
1800-142858-0048 CHOPPED STRAW MIXED WITH OATS IN THE PROPORTION OF A THIRD OF STRAW OR HAY IS A GOOD FOOD FOR HORSES IN FULL WORK AND CARROTS OF WHICH HORSES ARE REMARKABLY FOND HAVE A PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT IN A SHORT TIME
1800-142858-0049 THE WATER GIVEN TO A HORSE MERITS SOME ATTENTION IT SHOULD NOT BE TOO COLD HARD WATER IS NOT TO BE RECOMMENDED STAGNANT OR MUDDY WATER IS POSITIVELY INJURIOUS
1800-142858-0050 RIVER WATER IS THE BEST FOR ALL PURPOSES AND ANYTHING IS PREFERABLE TO SPRING WATER WHICH SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE SUN IN SUMMER FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AND STIRRED UP BEFORE USING IT
1800-142858-0051 WITH REASONABLE EXERCISE WILL NOT BE THROWN AWAY AFTER THIS OPERATION ON REACHING HOME VERY HOT THE GROOM SHOULD WALK HIM ABOUT FOR A FEW MINUTES THIS DONE HE SHOULD TAKE OFF THE MOISTURE WITH THE SCRAPER
1800-142858-0052 AND AFTERWARDS WISP HIM OVER WITH A HANDFUL OF STRAW AND A FLANNEL CLOTH IF THE CLOTH IS DIPPED IN SOME SPIRIT ALL THE BETTER HE SHOULD WASH PICK AND WIPE DRY THE LEGS AND FEET
1800-142858-0053 TAKE OFF THE BRIDLE AND CRUPPER AND FASTEN IT TO THE RACK THEN THE GIRTHS AND PUT A WISP OF STRAW UNDER THE SADDLE WHEN SUFFICIENTLY COOL THE HORSE SHOULD HAVE SOME HAY GIVEN HIM AND THEN A FEED OF OATS
1800-142858-0054 IF HE REFUSE THE LATTER OFFER HIM A LITTLE WET BRAN OR A HANDFUL OF OATMEAL IN TEPID WATER WHEN HE HAS BEEN FED HE SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY CLEANED AND HIS BODY CLOTHES PUT ON
1800-142858-0055 IF VERY MUCH HARASSED WITH FATIGUE A LITTLE GOOD ALE OR WINE WILL BE WELL BESTOWED ON A VALUABLE HORSE
1800-142858-0056 BRIDLES EVERY TIME A HORSE IS UNBRIDLED THE BIT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY WASHED AND DRIED AND THE LEATHER WIPED TO KEEP THEM SWEET AS WELL AS THE GIRTHS AND SADDLE
1800-142858-0057 THE LATTER BEING CAREFULLY DRIED AND BEATEN WITH A SWITCH BEFORE IT IS AGAIN PUT ON IN WASHING A HORSE'S FEET AFTER A DAY'S WORK THE MASTER SHOULD INSIST UPON THE LEGS AND FEET BEING WASHED THOROUGHLY WITH A SPONGE
1800-142858-0058 UNTIL THE WATER FLOWS OVER THEM
1800-142858-0059 HARNESS IF NOT CAREFULLY PRESERVED VERY SOON GETS A SHABBY TARNISHED APPEARANCE WHERE THE COACHMAN HAS A PROPER HARNESS ROOM AND SUFFICIENT ASSISTANCE THIS IS INEXCUSABLE
1800-142858-0060 AND EASILY PREVENTED THE HARNESS ROOM SHOULD HAVE A WOODEN LINING ALL ROUND AND BE PERFECTLY DRY AND WELL VENTILATED AROUND THE WALLS HOOKS AND PEGS SHOULD BE PLACED FOR THE SEVERAL PIECES OF HARNESS
1800-142858-0061 AND EVERY PART OF THE HARNESS SHOULD HAVE ITS PEG OR HOOK ONE FOR THE HALTERS ANOTHER FOR THE REINS AND OTHERS FOR SNAFFLES AND OTHER BITS AND METAL WORK
1800-142858-0062 AND EITHER A WOODEN HORSE OR SADDLE TREES FOR THE SADDLES AND PADS ALL THESE PARTS SHOULD BE DRY CLEAN AND SHINING THIS IS ONLY TO BE DONE BY CAREFUL CLEANING AND POLISHING
1800-142858-0063 AN EXCELLENT PASTE FOR POLISHING HARNESS AND THE LEATHER WORK OF CARRIAGES
1800-142858-0064 STIRRING IT TILL COMPLETELY DISSOLVED INTO THIS POUR ONE POUNDS OF LITHARGE OF THE SHOPS WHICH HAS BEEN POUNDED UP WITH WATER AND DRIED AND SIFTED THROUGH A SIEVE LEAVING THE TWO WHEN MIXED
1800-142858-0065 TO SIMMER ON THE FIRE STIRRING THEM CONTINUALLY TILL ALL IS MELTED WHEN IT IS A LITTLE COOL
1800-142858-0066 PLACE THIS AGAIN ON THE FIRE AND STIR TILL IT BOILS ANEW AND SUFFER IT TO COOL WHEN COOLED A LITTLE ADD DISTILLED TURPENTINE TILL IT HAS THE CONSISTENCE OF A THICKISH PASTE
1800-142858-0067 SCENTING IT WITH ANY ESSENCE AT HAND THINNING IT WHEN NECESSARY FROM TIME TO TIME
1800-142858-0068 WHEN THE LEATHER IS OLD AND GREASY IT SHOULD BE CLEANED BEFORE APPLYING THIS POLISH WITH A BRUSH WETTED IN A WEAK SOLUTION OF POTASS AND WATER WASHING AFTERWARDS WITH SOFT RIVER WATER AND DRYING THOROUGHLY
1800-142858-0069 IF THE LEATHER IS NOT BLACK ONE OR TWO COATS OF BLACK INK MAY BE GIVEN BEFORE APPLYING THE POLISH WHEN QUITE DRY THE VARNISH SHOULD BE LAID ON WITH A SOFT SHOE BRUSH
1800-142858-0070 WHEN THE LEATHER IS VERY OLD IT MAY BE SOFTENED WITH FISH OIL AND AFTER PUTTING ON THE INK A SPONGE CHARGED WITH DISTILLED TURPENTINE PASSED OVER TO SCOUR THE SURFACE OF THE LEATHER
1800-142858-0071 FOR FAWN OR YELLOW COLOURED LEATHER TAKE A QUART OF SKIMMED MILK POUR INTO IT ONE OZ OF SULPHURIC ACID AND WHEN COLD
1800-142858-0072 SHAKING THE BOTTLE GENTLY UNTIL IT CEASES TO EMIT WHITE VAPOURS SEPARATE THE COAGULATED FROM THE LIQUID PART BY STRAINING THROUGH A SIEVE AND STORE IT AWAY TILL REQUIRED
1800-142858-0073 IN APPLYING IT CLEAN THE LEATHER BY A WEAK SOLUTION OF OXALIC ACID WASHING IT OFF IMMEDIATELY
1800-142858-0074 WHEEL GREASE IS USUALLY PURCHASED AT THE SHOPS BUT A GOOD PASTE IS MADE AS FOLLOWS MELT EIGHTY PARTS OF GREASE AND STIR INTO IT MIXING IT THOROUGHLY AND SMOOTHLY
1800-142858-0075 THE FAMILY CARRIAGE OF THE DAY BEING A MODIFIED FORM OF THE CLARENCE ADAPTED FOR FAMILY USE THE CARRIAGE IS A VALUABLE PIECE OF FURNITURE REQUIRING ALL THE CARE OF THE MOST DELICATE UPHOLSTERY
1800-142858-0076 WITH THE ADDITIONAL DISADVANTAGE OF CONTINUAL EXPOSURE TO THE WEATHER
1800-142858-0077 AND A COACH HOUSE PERFECTLY DRY AND WELL VENTILATED FOR THE WOOD WORK SWELLS WITH MOISTURE IT SHRINKS ALSO WITH HEAT UNLESS THE TIMBER HAS UNDERGONE A LONG COURSE OF SEASONING IT SHOULD ALSO HAVE A DRY FLOOR
1800-142858-0078 A BOARDED ONE BEING RECOMMENDED IT MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE AMMONIACAL INFLUENCE OF THE STABLES FROM OPEN DRAINS AND CESSPOOLS AND OTHER GASEOUS INFLUENCES LIKELY TO AFFECT THE PAINT AND VARNISH
1800-142858-0079 WHEN THE CARRIAGE RETURNS HOME IT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY WASHED AND DRIED AND THAT IF POSSIBLE BEFORE THE MUD HAS TIME TO DRY ON IT
1800-142858-0080 THIS IS DONE BY FIRST WELL SLUSHING IT WITH CLEAN WATER SO AS TO WASH AWAY ALL PARTICLES OF SAND HAVING FIRST CLOSED THE SASHES TO AVOID WETTING THE LININGS
1800-142858-0081 THE BODY IS THEN GONE CAREFULLY OVER WITH A SOFT MOP USING PLENTY OF CLEAN WATER AND PENETRATING INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE CARVED WORK SO THAT NOT AN ATOM OF DIRT REMAINS
1800-142858-0082 THE BODY OF THE CARRIAGE IS THEN RAISED BY PLACING THE JACK UNDER THE AXLETREE AND RAISING IT SO THAT THE WHEEL TURNS FREELY THIS IS NOW THOROUGHLY WASHED WITH THE MOP UNTIL THE DIRT IS REMOVED
1800-142858-0083 USING A WATER BRUSH FOR CORNERS WHERE THE MOP DOES NOT PENETRATE EVERY PARTICLE OF MUD AND SAND REMOVED BY THE MOP AND AFTERWARDS WITH A WET SPONGE THE CARRIAGE IS WIPED DRY AND
1800-142858-0084 AS SOON AFTER AS POSSIBLE THE VARNISH IS CAREFULLY POLISHED WITH SOFT LEATHER USING A LITTLE SWEET OIL FOR THE LEATHER PARTS AND EVEN FOR THE PANELS SO AS TO CHECK ANY TENDENCY OF THE VARNISH TO CRACK
1800-142858-0085 STAINS ARE REMOVED BY RUBBING THEM WITH THE LEATHER AND SWEET OIL IF THAT FAILS
1800-142858-0086 IN PREPARING THE CARRIAGE FOR USE THE WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE RUBBED OVER WITH A CLEAN LEATHER AND CAREFULLY POLISHED THE IRON WORK AND JOINTS OILED THE PLATED AND BRASS WORK OCCASIONALLY CLEANED
1800-142858-0087 THE ONE WITH PLATE POWDER OR WITH WELL WASHED WHITING MIXED WITH SWEET OIL AND LEATHER KEPT FOR THE PURPOSE THE OTHER WITH ROTTENSTONE MIXED WITH A LITTLE OIL AND APPLIED WITHOUT TOO MUCH RUBBING UNTIL THE PASTE IS REMOVED
1800-142858-0088 BUT IF RUBBED EVERY DAY WITH THE LEATHER LITTLE MORE WILL BE REQUIRED TO KEEP IT UNTARNISHED THE LININGS REQUIRE CAREFUL BRUSHING EVERY DAY THE CUSHIONS BEING TAKEN OUT AND BEATEN
1800-142858-0089 AND THE GLASS SASHES SHOULD ALWAYS BE BRIGHT AND CLEAN THE WHEEL TIRES AND AXLETREE ARE CAREFULLY SEEN TO AND GREASED WHEN REQUIRED THE BOLTS AND NUTS TIGHTENED
1800-142858-0090 THESE DUTIES HOWEVER ARE ONLY INCIDENTAL TO THE COACHMAN'S OFFICE WHICH IS TO DRIVE AND MUCH OF THE ENJOYMENT OF THOSE IN THE CARRIAGE DEPENDS ON HIS PROFICIENCY IN HIS ART MUCH ALSO OF
1800-142858-0091 THE WEAR OF THE CARRIAGE AND HORSES HE SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CARRIAGE TO KNOW WHEN IT IS OUT OF ORDER TO KNOW ALSO THE PACE AT WHICH HE CAN GO OVER THE ROAD HE HAS UNDER HIM WITHOUT RISKING THE SPRINGS
1800-142858-0092 HAVING WITH OR WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE GROOM OR STABLE BOY PUT HIS HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE AND SATISFIED HIMSELF BY WALKING ROUND THEM THAT EVERYTHING IS PROPERLY ARRANGED
1800-142858-0093 THE COACHMAN PROCEEDS TO THE OFF SIDE OF THE CARRIAGE TAKES THE REINS FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSES WHERE THEY WERE THROWN BUCKLES THEM TOGETHER AND PLACING HIS FOOT ON THE STEP ASCENDS TO HIS BOX
1800-142858-0094 HAVING HIS HORSES NOW ENTIRELY UNDER CONTROL IN ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HE IS NOT EXPECTED TO DESCEND FOR WHERE NO FOOTMAN ACCOMPANIES THE CARRIAGE
1800-142858-0095 THE DOORS ARE USUALLY SO ARRANGED THAT EVEN A LADY MAY LET HERSELF OUT IF SHE WISHES IT FROM THE INSIDE THE COACHMAN'S DUTIES ARE TO AVOID EVERYTHING APPROACHING AN ACCIDENT
1800-142858-0096 THE PACE AT WHICH HE DRIVES WILL DEPEND UPON HIS ORDERS IN ALL PROBABILITY A MODERATE PACE OF SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES AN HOUR LESS SPEED IS INJURIOUS TO THE HORSES GETTING THEM INTO LAZY AND SLUGGISH HABITS
1800-142858-0097 FOR IT IS WONDERFUL HOW SOON THESE ARE ACQUIRED BY SOME HORSES THE WRITER WAS ONCE EMPLOYED TO PURCHASE A HORSE FOR A COUNTRY FRIEND AND HE PICKED A VERY HANDSOME GELDING OUT OF COLLINS'S STABLES WHICH SEEMED TO ANSWER TO HIS FRIEND'S WANTS
1800-142858-0098 IT WAS DULY COMMITTED TO THE COACHMAN WHO WAS TO DRIVE IT AFTER SOME VERY SUCCESSFUL TRIALS IN HARNESS AND OUT OF IT AND SEEMED LIKELY TO GIVE GREAT SATISFACTION AFTER A TIME THE FRIEND GOT TIRED OF HIS CARRIAGE AND GAVE IT UP
1800-142858-0099 AS THE EASIEST MODE OF GETTING RID OF THE HORSE IT WAS SENT UP TO THE WRITER'S STABLES A PRESENT ONLY TWELVE MONTHS HAD ELAPSED THE HORSE WAS AS HANDSOME AS EVER WITH PLENTY OF FLESH AND A SLEEK GLOSSY COAT
1800-142858-0100 AND HE WAS THANKFULLY ENOUGH RECEIVED BUT ON TRIAL IT WAS FOUND THAT A STUPID COACHMAN WHO WAS IMBUED WITH ONE OF THEIR OLD MAXIMS THAT IT'S THE PACE THAT KILLS HAD DRIVEN THE HORSE
1800-142858-0101 AT A JOG TROT OF FOUR MILES OR FOUR AND A HALF AND NOW NO PERSUASION OF THE WHIP COULD GET MORE OUT OF HIM AFTER MANY UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO BRING HIM BACK TO HIS PACE IN ONE OF WHICH A BREAK DOWN OCCURRED
1800-142858-0102 UNDER THE HANDS OF A PROFESSIONAL TRAINER HE WAS SENT TO THE HAMMER AND SOLD FOR A SUM THAT DID NOT PAY FOR THE ATTEMPT TO BREAK HIM IN THIS MAXIM THEREFORE THAT IT'S THE PACE THAT KILLS
1800-142858-0103 IS ALTOGETHER FALLACIOUS IN THE MODERATE SENSE IN WHICH WE ARE VIEWING IT IN THE OLD COACHING DAYS INDEED WHEN THE SHREWSBURY WONDER DROVE INTO THE INN YARD WHILE THE CLOCK WAS STRIKING WEEK AFTER WEEK AND MOUTH AFTER MONTH
1800-142858-0104 WITH UNERRING REGULARITY TWENTY SEVEN HOURS TO A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILES WHEN THE QUICKSILVER MAIL WAS TIMED TO ELEVEN MILES AN HOUR BETWEEN LONDON AND PLYMOUTH
1800-142858-0105 WHEN THE BRIGHTON AGE TOOL'D AND HORSED BY THE LATE MISTER STEVENSON USED TO DASH ROUND THE SQUARE AS THE FIFTH HOUR WAS STRIKING HAVING STOPPED AT THE HALF WAY HOUSE WHILE HIS SERVANT HANDED A SANDWICH AND A GLASS OF SHERRY TO HIS PASSENGERS
1800-142858-0106 THEN THE PACE WAS INDEED KILLING BUT THE TRUTH IS HORSES THAT ARE DRIVEN AT A JOG TROT PACE LOSE THAT ELAN WITH WHICH A GOOD DRIVER CAN INSPIRE THEM
1800-142858-0107 AND THEY ARE LEFT TO DO THEIR WORK BY MERE WEIGHT AND MUSCLE THEREFORE UNLESS HE HAS CONTRARY ORDERS A GOOD DRIVER WILL CHOOSE A SMART PACE BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS HORSES PERSPIRE
1800-142858-0108 IN CHOOSING HIS HORSES EVERY MASTER WILL SEE THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY PAIRED THAT THEIR PACES ARE ABOUT EQUAL WHEN THEIR HABITS DIFFER IT IS THE COACHMAN'S DUTY TO DISCOVER HOW HE CAN WITH LEAST ANNOYANCE TO THE HORSES
1800-142858-0109 GET THAT PACE OUT OF THEM SOME HORSES HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BE DRIVEN ON THE CHECK AND THE CURB IRRITATES THEM OTHERS WITH HARDER MOUTHS CANNOT BE CONTROLLED WITH THE SLIGHT LEVERAGE THIS AFFORDS HE MUST THEREFORE
1800-142858-0110 THE REINS SHOULD ALWAYS BE HELD SO THAT THE HORSES ARE IN HAND BUT HE IS A VERY BAD DRIVER WHO ALWAYS DRIVES WITH A TIGHT REIN THE PAIN TO THE HORSE IS INTOLERABLE
1800-142858-0111 AND CAUSES HIM TO REAR AND PLUNGE AND FINALLY BREAK SWAY IF HE CAN HE IS ALSO A BAD DRIVER WHEN THE REINS ARE ALWAYS SLACK THE HORSE THEN FEELS ABANDONED TO HIMSELF HE IS NEITHER DIRECTED NOR SUPPORTED
1800-142858-0112 THE TRUE COACHMAN'S HANDS ARE SO DELICATE AND GENTLE THAT THE MERE WEIGHT OF THE REINS IS FELT ON THE BIT AND THE DIRECTIONS ARE INDICATED BY A TURN OF THE WRIST RATHER THAN BY A PULL
1800-142858-0113 THE HORSES ARE GUIDED AND ENCOURAGED AND ONLY PULLED UP WHEN THEY EXCEED THEIR INTENDED PACE OR IN THE EVENT OF A STUMBLE
1800-142858-0114 IN DRIVING THE COACHMAN SHOULD NEVER GIVE WAY TO TEMPER HOW OFTEN DO WE SEE HORSES STUMBLE FROM BEING CONDUCTED OR AT LEAST ALLOWED TO GO OVER BAD GROUND BY SOME CARELESS DRIVER
1800-142858-0115 MIGHT WITH MUCH MORE JUSTICE BE APPLIED TO HIS OWN BRUTAL SHOULDERS
