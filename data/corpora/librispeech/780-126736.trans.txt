780-126736-0000 LIKE A WET MUDDY TRENCH THEN CROSSING A VERY BROAD THOROUGHFARE ENTERED A PUBLIC EDIFICE AND SOUGHT SPEECH WITH A YOUNG PRIVATE SECRETARY UNPAID OF A GREAT PERSONAGE THIS FAIR SMOOTH FACED YOUNG MAN
780-126736-0001 WHOSE SYMMETRICALLY ARRANGED HAIR GAVE HIM THE AIR OF A LARGE AND NEAT SCHOOLBOY MET THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S REQUEST WITH A DOUBTFUL LOOK AND SPOKE WITH BATED BREATH WOULD HE SEE YOU
780-126736-0002 HE MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR HIM BUT HE DOES IT FOR THE SAKE OF A LITTLE EXERCISE I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL THE EXERCISE HE CAN FIND TIME FOR WHILE THIS SESSION LASTS I DON'T COMPLAIN I RATHER ENJOY THESE LITTLE STROLLS HE LEANS ON MY ARM AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS LIPS BUT I SAY HE'S VERY TIRED
780-126736-0003 IT'S IN CONNECTION WITH THAT GREENWICH AFFAIR OH I SAY HE'S VERY BITTER AGAINST YOU PEOPLE BUT I WILL GO AND SEE IF YOU INSIST DO THAT'S A GOOD FELLOW SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
780-126736-0004 THE UNPAID SECRETARY ADMIRED THIS PLUCK COMPOSING FOR HIMSELF AN INNOCENT FACE HE OPENED A DOOR AND WENT IN WITH THE ASSURANCE OF A NICE AND PRIVILEGED CHILD AND PRESENTLY HE REAPPEARED
780-126736-0005 WITH A NOD TO THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WHO PASSING THROUGH THE SAME DOOR LEFT OPEN FOR HIM
780-126736-0006 VAST IN BULK AND STATURE WITH A LONG WHITE FACE WHICH BROADENED AT THE BASE BY A BIG DOUBLE CHIN APPEARED EGG SHAPED IN THE FRINGE OF THIN GREYISH WHISKER THE GREAT PERSONAGE SEEMED AN EXPANDING MAN
780-126736-0007 UNFORTUNATE FROM A TAILORING POINT OF VIEW THE CROSS FOLDS IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUTTONED BLACK COAT ADDED TO THE IMPRESSION AS IF THE FASTENINGS OF THE GARMENT WERE TRIED TO THE UTMOST FROM THE HEAD SET UPWARD ON A THICK NECK THE EYES WITH PUFFY LOWER LIDS
780-126736-0008 STARED WITH A HAUGHTY DROOP ON EACH SIDE OF A HOOKED AGGRESSIVE NOSE NOBLY SALIENT IN THE VAST PALE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE FACE A SHINY SILK HAT AND A PAIR OF WORN GLOVES LYING READY ON THE END OF A LONG TABLE LOOKED EXPANDED TOO
780-126736-0009 ENORMOUS HE STOOD ON THE HEARTHRUG IN BIG ROOMY BOOTS AND UTTERED NO WORD OF GREETING
780-126736-0010 DON'T GO INTO DETAILS I HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S FIGURE BEFORE THIS BIG AND RUSTIC PRESENCE HAD THE FRAIL SLENDERNESS OF A REED ADDRESSING AN OAK AND INDEED
780-126736-0011 THE UNBROKEN RECORD OF THAT MAN'S DESCENT SURPASSED IN THE NUMBER OF CENTURIES THE AGE OF THE OLDEST OAK IN THE COUNTRY NO AS FAR AS ONE CAN BE POSITIVE ABOUT ANYTHING I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IT IS NOT YES BUT YOUR IDEA OF ASSURANCES OVER THERE
780-126736-0012 LOOK A FOOL I HAVE BEEN TOLD POSITIVELY IN THIS VERY ROOM LESS THAN A MONTH AGO THAT NOTHING OF THE SORT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE
780-126736-0013 THAT SO FAR I HAVE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE YOU ASSURANCES OF ANY KIND THE HAUGHTY DROOP OF THE EYES WAS FOCUSSED NOW UPON THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER TRUE CONFESSED THE DEEP SMOOTH VOICE I SENT FOR HEAT
780-126736-0014 YOU ARE STILL RATHER A NOVICE IN YOUR NEW BERTH AND
780-126736-0015 OF COURSE OF COURSE I HOPE YOU WILL GET ON THANK YOU SIR ETHELRED I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING TO DAY AND EVEN WITHIN THE LAST HOUR OR SO THERE IS MUCH IN THIS AFFAIR OF A KIND THAT DOES NOT MEET THE EYE IN A USUAL ANARCHIST OUTRAGE EVEN IF ONE LOOKED INTO IT AS DEEP AS CAN BE
780-126736-0016 THE GREAT MAN PUT HIS ARMS AKIMBO THE BACKS OF HIS BIG HANDS RESTING ON HIS HIPS VERY WELL GO ON ONLY NO DETAILS PRAY SPARE ME THE DETAILS YOU SHALL NOT BE TROUBLED WITH THEM SIR ETHELRED
780-126736-0017 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER BEGAN WITH A CALM AND UNTROUBLED ASSURANCE WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING THE HANDS ON THE FACE OF THE CLOCK BEHIND THE GREAT MAN'S BACK A HEAVY GLISTENING AFFAIR OF MASSIVE SCROLLS IN THE SAME DARK MARBLE AS THE MANTELPIECE
780-126736-0018 AND WITH A GHOSTLY EVANESCENT TICK HAD MOVED THROUGH THE SPACE OF SEVEN MINUTES HE SPOKE WITH A STUDIOUS FIDELITY TO A PARENTHETICAL MANNER INTO WHICH EVERY LITTLE FACT THAT IS EVERY DETAIL FITTED WITH DELIGHTFUL EASE
780-126736-0019 NOT A MURMUR NOR EVEN A MOVEMENT HINTED AT INTERRUPTION THE GREAT PERSONAGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE STATUE OF ONE OF HIS OWN PRINCELY ANCESTORS STRIPPED OF A CRUSADER'S WAR HARNESS AND PUT INTO AN ILL FITTING FROCK COAT
780-126736-0020 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE AT LIBERTY TO TALK FOR AN HOUR BUT HE KEPT HIS HEAD AND AT THE END OF THE TIME MENTIONED ABOVE HE BROKE OFF WITH A SUDDEN CONCLUSION WHICH REPRODUCING THE OPENING STATEMENT PLEASANTLY SURPRISED SIR ETHELRED
780-126736-0021 BY ITS APPARENT SWIFTNESS AND FORCE THE KIND OF THING WHICH MEETS US UNDER THE SURFACE OF THIS AFFAIR OTHERWISE WITHOUT GRAVITY IS UNUSUAL IN THIS PRECISE FORM AT LEAST AND REQUIRES SPECIAL TREATMENT
780-126736-0022 THE TONE OF SIR ETHELRED WAS DEEPENED FULL OF CONVICTION I SHOULD THINK SO INVOLVING THE AMBASSADOR OF A FOREIGN POWER OH THE AMBASSADOR PROTESTED THE OTHER ERECT AND SLENDER ALLOWING HIMSELF A MERE HALF SMILE
780-126736-0023 IT WOULD BE STUPID OF ME TO ADVANCE ANYTHING OF THE KIND AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY BECAUSE IF I AM RIGHT IN MY SURMISES WHETHER AMBASSADOR OR HALL PORTER IT'S A MERE DETAIL
780-126736-0024 SIR ETHELRED OPENED A WIDE MOUTH LIKE A CAVERN INTO WHICH THE HOOKED NOSE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PEER THERE CAME FROM IT A SUBDUED ROLLING SOUND AS FROM A DISTANT ORGAN
780-126736-0025 WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY IMPORTING THEIR METHODS OF CRIM TARTARY HERE A TURK WOULD HAVE MORE DECENCY YOU FORGET SIR ETHELRED THAT STRICTLY SPEAKING WE KNOW NOTHING POSITIVELY AS YET NO BUT HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE IT SHORTLY
780-126736-0026 WE CAN'T PUT UP WITH THE INNOCENCE OF NASTY LITTLE CHILDREN SAID THE GREAT AND EXPANDED PERSONAGE EXPANDING A LITTLE MORE AS IT WERE
780-126736-0027 THEY'LL HAVE TO GET A HARD RAP ON THE KNUCKLES OVER THIS AFFAIR WE MUST BE IN A POSITION TO WHAT IS YOUR GENERAL IDEA STATED SHORTLY NO NEED TO GO INTO DETAILS NO SIR ETHELRED IN PRINCIPLE
780-126736-0028 I SHOULD LAY IT DOWN THAT THE EXISTENCE OF SECRET AGENTS SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED AS TENDING TO AUGMENT THE POSITIVE DANGERS OF THE EVIL AGAINST WHICH THEY ARE USED THAT THE SPY WILL FABRICATE HIS INFORMATION IS A MERE COMMONPLACE BUT IN THE SPHERE OF
780-126736-0029 POLITICAL AND REVOLUTIONARY ACTION RELYING PARTLY ON VIOLENCE THE PROFESSIONAL SPY HAS EVERY FACILITY TO FABRICATE THE VERY FACTS THEMSELVES AND WILL SPREAD THE DOUBLE EVIL OF EMULATION IN ONE DIRECTION AND OF PANIC
780-126736-0030 HASTY LEGISLATION UNREFLECTING HATE ON THE OTHER HOWEVER THIS IS AN IMPERFECT WORLD
780-126736-0031 WITH BIG ELBOWS STUCK OUT SAID HASTILY BE LUCID PLEASE YES SIR ETHELRED AN IMPERFECT WORLD THEREFORE DIRECTLY THE CHARACTER OF THIS AFFAIR SUGGESTED ITSELF TO ME I THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH WITH SPECIAL SECRECY
780-126736-0032 AND VENTURED TO COME OVER HERE THAT'S RIGHT APPROVED THE GREAT PERSONAGE GLANCING DOWN COMPLACENTLY OVER HIS DOUBLE CHIN I AM GLAD THERE'S SOMEBODY OVER AT YOUR SHOP
780-126736-0033 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
780-126736-0034 AN AMUSED SMILE I WAS REALLY THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER AT THIS STAGE FOR HEAT TO BE REPLACED BY WHAT HEAT
780-126736-0035 NOT AT ALL PRAY SIR ETHELRED DON'T PUT THAT UNJUST INTERPRETATION ON MY REMARKS THEN WHAT TOO CLEVER BY HALF NEITHER AT LEAST NOT AS A RULE ALL THE GROUNDS OF MY SURMISES I HAVE FROM HIM
780-126736-0036 THE ONLY THING I'VE DISCOVERED BY MYSELF IS THAT HE HAS BEEN MAKING USE OF THAT MAN PRIVATELY WHO COULD BLAME HIM HE'S AN OLD POLICE HAND HE TOLD ME VIRTUALLY THAT HE MUST HAVE TOOLS TO WORK WITH IT OCCURRED TO ME
780-126736-0037 THAT THIS TOOL SHOULD BE SURRENDERED TO THE SPECIAL CRIMES DIVISION AS A WHOLE INSTEAD OF REMAINING THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OF CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT I EXTEND MY CONCEPTION OF OUR DEPARTMENTAL DUTIES TO THE SUPPRESSION OF THE SECRET AGENT BUT
780-126736-0038 CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT IS AN OLD DEPARTMENTAL HAND HE WOULD ACCUSE ME OF PERVERTING ITS MORALITY AND ATTACKING ITS EFFICIENCY HE WOULD DEFINE IT BITTERLY AS PROTECTION EXTENDED TO THE CRIMINAL CLASS OF REVOLUTIONISTS IT WOULD MEAN JUST THAT TO HIM
780-126736-0039 YES BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN TO SAY FIRST THAT THERE'S BUT POOR COMFORT IN BEING ABLE TO DECLARE THAT ANY GIVEN ACT OF VIOLENCE DAMAGING PROPERTY OR DESTROYING LIFE IS NOT THE WORK OF ANARCHISM AT ALL
780-126736-0040 BUT OF SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER SOME SPECIES OF AUTHORISED SCOUNDRELISM THIS I FANCY IS MUCH MORE FREQUENT THAN WE SUPPOSE NEXT IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THESE PEOPLE IN THE PAY OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS DESTROYS IN A MEASURE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SUPERVISION
780-126736-0041 A SPY OF THAT SORT CAN AFFORD TO BE MORE RECKLESS THAN THE MOST RECKLESS OF CONSPIRATORS HIS OCCUPATION IS FREE FROM ALL RESTRAINT HE'S WITHOUT AS MUCH FAITH AS IS NECESSARY FOR COMPLETE NEGATION AND WITHOUT THAT MUCH LAW AS IS IMPLIED IN LAWLESSNESS
780-126736-0042 THIRDLY THE EXISTENCE OF THESE SPIES AMONGST THE REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS WHICH WE ARE REPROACHED FOR HARBOURING HERE DOES AWAY WITH ALL CERTITUDE
780-126736-0043 IT WAS BY NO MEANS GROUNDLESS AND YET THIS EPISODE HAPPENS I CALL IT AN EPISODE BECAUSE THIS AFFAIR I MAKE BOLD TO SAY IS EPISODIC IT IS NO PART OF ANY GENERAL SCHEME HOWEVER WILD
780-126736-0044 THE VERY PECULIARITIES WHICH SURPRISE AND PERPLEX CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ESTABLISH ITS CHARACTER IN MY EYES I AM KEEPING CLEAR OF DETAILS SIR ETHELRED
780-126736-0045 HAD BEEN LISTENING WITH PROFOUND ATTENTION
780-126736-0046 INTIMATED BY AN EARNEST DEFERENTIAL GESTURE THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO BE CONCISE
780-126736-0047 PECULIAR STUPIDITY AND FEEBLENESS IN THE CONDUCT OF THIS AFFAIR WHICH GIVES ME EXCELLENT HOPES OF GETTING BEHIND IT AND FINDING THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAN AN INDIVIDUAL FREAK OF FANATICISM FOR IT IS A PLANNED THING UNDOUBTEDLY
780-126736-0048 AND THEN ABANDONED HURRIEDLY TO HIS OWN DEVICES
780-126736-0049 UNLESS ONE WERE TO ACCEPT THE FANTASTIC THEORY THAT HE WAS A DEAF MUTE
780-126736-0050 NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCIDENT BUT AN EXTRAORDINARY LITTLE FACT REMAINS THE ADDRESS ON HIS CLOTHING DISCOVERED BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT TOO IT IS AN INCREDIBLE LITTLE FACT SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE EXPLANATION WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR IT IS BOUND TO TOUCH THE BOTTOM OF THIS AFFAIR
780-126736-0051 INSTEAD OF INSTRUCTING HEAT TO GO ON WITH THIS CASE MY INTENTION IS TO SEEK THIS EXPLANATION PERSONALLY BY MYSELF
780-126736-0052 THAT IS IN A CERTAIN SHOP IN BRETT STREET AND ON THE LIPS OF A CERTAIN SECRET AGENT ONCE UPON A TIME THE CONFIDENTIAL AND TRUSTED SPY
780-126736-0053 TO THE COURT OF SAINT JAMES THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER PAUSED THEN ADDED THOSE FELLOWS ARE A PERFECT PEST
780-126736-0054 THE PERSONAGE ON THE HEARTHRUG HAD GRADUALLY TILTED HIS HEAD FARTHER BACK WHICH GAVE HIM AN ASPECT OF EXTRAORDINARY HAUGHTINESS WHY NOT LEAVE IT TO HEAT BECAUSE HE IS AN OLD DEPARTMENTAL HAND
780-126736-0055 THEY HAVE THEIR OWN MORALITY MY LINE OF INQUIRY WOULD APPEAR TO HIM AN AWFUL PERVERSION OF DUTY FOR HIM THE PLAIN DUTY IS TO FASTEN THE GUILT UPON AS MANY PROMINENT ANARCHISTS AS HE CAN
780-126736-0056 ON SOME SLIGHT INDICATIONS HE HAD PICKED UP IN THE COURSE OF HIS INVESTIGATION ON THE SPOT WHEREAS I HE WOULD SAY AM BENT UPON VINDICATING THEIR INNOCENCE I AM TRYING TO BE AS LUCID AS I CAN IN PRESENTING THIS OBSCURE MATTER TO YOU WITHOUT DETAILS
780-126736-0057 MUTTERED THE PROUD HEAD OF SIR ETHELRED FROM ITS LOFTY ELEVATION I AM AFRAID SO WITH AN INDIGNATION AND DISGUST OF WHICH YOU OR I CAN HAVE NO IDEA HE'S AN EXCELLENT SERVANT WE MUST NOT PUT AN UNDUE STRAIN ON HIS LOYALTY
780-126736-0058 THAT'S ALWAYS A MISTAKE BESIDES I WANT A FREE HAND
780-126736-0059 I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST WISH TO SPARE THIS MAN VERLOC
780-126736-0060 BROUGHT HOME TO HIM SO QUICKLY FRIGHTENING HIM WILL NOT BE VERY DIFFICULT BUT OUR TRUE OBJECTIVE LIES BEHIND HIM SOMEWHERE
780-126736-0061 AS I MAY THINK PROPER CERTAINLY SAID THE PERSONAGE ON THE HEARTHRUG FIND OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN FIND IT OUT IN YOUR OWN WAY
780-126736-0062 SIR ETHELRED SHIFTED ONE HAND UNDER HIS COAT TAILS AND TILTING BACK HIS HEAD LOOKED AT HIM STEADILY WE'LL HAVE A LATE SITTING TO NIGHT HE SAID COME TO THE HOUSE WITH YOUR DISCOVERIES IF WE ARE NOT GONE HOME
780-126736-0063 I'LL WARN TOODLES TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU HE'LL TAKE YOU INTO MY ROOM THE NUMEROUS FAMILY AND THE WIDE CONNECTIONS OF THE YOUTHFUL LOOKING PRIVATE SECRETARY CHERISHED FOR HIM THE HOPE OF AN AUSTERE AND EXALTED DESTINY
780-126736-0064 MEANTIME THE SOCIAL SPHERE HE ADORNED IN HIS HOURS OF IDLENESS CHOSE TO PET HIM UNDER THE ABOVE NICKNAME AND SIR ETHELRED
780-126736-0065 MOSTLY AT BREAKFAST TIME HAD CONFERRED UPON IT THE DIGNITY OF UNSMILING ADOPTION THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WAS SURPRISED AND GRATIFIED EXTREMELY
780-126736-0066 I SHALL CERTAINLY BRING MY DISCOVERIES TO THE HOUSE ON THE CHANCE OF YOU HAVING THE TIME TO I WON'T HAVE THE TIME INTERRUPTED THE GREAT PERSONAGE BUT I WILL SEE YOU
780-126736-0067 AND YOU ARE GOING YOURSELF YES SIR ETHELRED I THINK IT THE BEST WAY THE PERSONAGE HAD TILTED HIS HEAD SO FAR BACK THAT IN ORDER TO KEEP THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER UNDER HIS OBSERVATION HE HAD TO NEARLY CLOSE HIS EYES
780-126736-0068 HOW DO YOU PROPOSE WILL YOU ASSUME A DISGUISE HARDLY A DISGUISE I'LL CHANGE MY CLOTHES OF COURSE OF
780-126736-0069 THE GILT HANDS HAD TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL THROUGH NO LESS THAN FIVE AND TWENTY MINUTES BEHIND HIS BACK THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WHO COULD NOT SEE THEM GREW A LITTLE NERVOUS IN THE INTERVAL BUT THE GREAT MAN PRESENTED TO HIM A CALM AND UNDISMAYED FACE
780-126736-0070 BUT WHAT FIRST PUT YOU IN MOTION IN THIS DIRECTION
780-126736-0071 THAT'S OF COURSE BUT THE IMMEDIATE MOTIVE WHAT SHALL I SAY SIR ETHELRED A NEW MAN'S ANTAGONISM TO OLD METHODS A DESIRE TO KNOW SOMETHING AT FIRST HAND SOME IMPATIENCE IT'S MY OLD WORK BUT THE HARNESS IS DIFFERENT
780-126736-0072 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SHOOK IT AND WITHDREW IN THE OUTER ROOM TOODLES WHO HAD BEEN WAITING PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF A TABLE ADVANCED TO MEET HIM SUBDUING HIS NATURAL BUOYANCY WELL SATISFACTORY
780-126736-0073 HE ASKED WITH AIRY IMPORTANCE PERFECTLY YOU'VE EARNED MY UNDYING GRATITUDE
780-126736-0074 THAT'S ALL RIGHT BUT SERIOUSLY YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW IRRITATED HE IS BY THE ATTACKS ON HIS BILL FOR THE NATIONALISATION OF FISHERIES THEY CALL IT THE BEGINNING OF SOCIAL REVOLUTION
780-126736-0075 REMARKED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ODIOUS EH AND YOU HAVE NO NOTION WHAT A MASS OF WORK HE HAS GOT TO GET THROUGH EVERY DAY HE DOES IT ALL HIMSELF SEEMS UNABLE TO TRUST ANYONE WITH THESE FISHERIES AND YET
780-126736-0076 HE'S GIVEN A WHOLE HALF HOUR TO THE CONSIDERATION OF MY VERY SMALL SPRAT INTERJECTED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SMALL IS IT I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT
780-126736-0077 THIS FIGHT TAKES IT OUT OF HIM FRIGHTFULLY THE MAN'S GETTING EXHAUSTED I FEEL IT BY THE WAY HE LEANS ON MY ARM AS WE WALK OVER
780-126736-0078 IS HE SAFE IN THE STREETS MULLINS HAS BEEN MARCHING HIS MEN UP HERE THIS AFTERNOON
780-126736-0079 IT WILL GET ON HIS NERVES PRESENTLY I SAY THESE FOREIGN SCOUNDRELS AREN'T LIKELY TO THROW SOMETHING AT HIM ARE THEY IT WOULD BE A NATIONAL CALAMITY THE COUNTRY CAN'T SPARE HIM NOT TO MENTION YOURSELF HE LEANS ON YOUR ARM SUGGESTED THE
780-126736-0080 IT WOULD BE AN EASY WAY FOR A YOUNG MAN TO GO DOWN INTO HISTORY NOT SO MANY BRITISH MINISTERS HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED AS TO MAKE IT A MINOR INCIDENT
780-126736-0081 I AM AFRAID THAT IF YOU WANT TO GO DOWN INTO HISTORY YOU'LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING FOR IT SERIOUSLY THERE'S NO DANGER WHATEVER FOR BOTH OF YOU BUT FROM OVERWORK THE SYMPATHETIC TOODLES WELCOMED THIS OPENING FOR A CHUCKLE
780-126736-0082 I AM USED TO LATE HOURS HE DECLARED WITH INGENUOUS LEVITY BUT FEELING AN INSTANT COMPUNCTION HE BEGAN TO ASSUME AN AIR OF STATESMAN LIKE MOODINESS AS ONE DRAWS ON A GLOVE HIS MASSIVE INTELLECT WILL STAND ANY AMOUNT OF WORK
780-126736-0083 IT'S HIS NERVES THAT I AM AFRAID OF THE REACTIONARY GANG WITH THAT ABUSIVE BRUTE CHEESEMAN AT THEIR HEAD INSULT HIM EVERY NIGHT IF HE WILL INSIST ON BEGINNING A REVOLUTION MURMURED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THE TIME HAS COME
780-126736-0084 AND HE IS THE ONLY MAN GREAT ENOUGH FOR THE WORK PROTESTED THE REVOLUTIONARY TOODLES FLARING UP UNDER THE CALM SPECULATIVE GAZE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SOMEWHERE IN A CORRIDOR A DISTANT BELL TINKLED URGENTLY
780-126736-0085 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WENT OUT BY ANOTHER DOOR IN A LESS ELASTIC MANNER AGAIN HE CROSSED THE WIDE THOROUGHFARE WALKED ALONG A NARROW STREET AND RE ENTERED HASTILY HIS OWN DEPARTMENTAL BUILDINGS
780-126736-0086 HE KEPT UP THIS ACCELERATED PACE TO THE DOOR OF HIS PRIVATE ROOM
780-126736-0087 HE STOOD STILL FOR A MOMENT THEN WALKED UP
780-126736-0088 SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR RANG A BELL AND WAITED CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT GONE YET
780-126736-0089 HE NODDED THAT WILL DO AND SITTING STILL WITH HIS HAT PUSHED OFF HIS FOREHEAD
780-126736-0090 BUT HE THOUGHT THIS WITHOUT ANIMOSITY OLD AND VALUED SERVANTS WILL TAKE LIBERTIES THE PIECE OF OVERCOAT WITH THE ADDRESS SEWN ON WAS CERTAINLY NOT A THING TO LEAVE ABOUT
780-126736-0091 HE WROTE AND DESPATCHED A NOTE TO HIS WIFE CHARGING HER TO MAKE HIS APOLOGIES TO MICHAELIS GREAT LADY WITH WHOM THEY WERE ENGAGED TO DINE THAT EVENING THE SHORT JACKET AND THE LOW ROUND HAT HE ASSUMED IN A SORT OF CURTAINED ALCOVE CONTAINING A WASHSTAND A ROW OF WOODEN PEGS AND A SHELF
780-126736-0092 HE STEPPED BACK INTO THE FULL LIGHT OF THE ROOM LOOKING LIKE THE VISION OF A COOL REFLECTIVE DON QUIXOTE WITH THE SUNKEN EYES OF A DARK ENTHUSIAST AND A VERY DELIBERATE MANNER HE LEFT THE SCENE OF HIS DAILY LABOURS QUICKLY LIKE AN UNOBTRUSIVE SHADOW
780-126736-0093 HIS DESCENT INTO THE STREET WAS LIKE THE DESCENT INTO A SLIMY AQUARIUM FROM WHICH THE WATER HAD BEEN RUN OFF
780-126736-0094 THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES WERE WET
780-126736-0095 GLISTENED WITH AN EFFECT OF PHOSPHORESCENCE AND WHEN HE EMERGED INTO THE STRAND OUT OF A NARROW STREET BY THE SIDE OF CHARING CROSS STATION THE GENIUS OF THE LOCALITY ASSIMILATED HIM HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT ONE MORE OF THE QUEER FOREIGN FISH
780-126736-0096 THAT CAN BE SEEN OF AN EVENING ABOUT THERE FLITTING ROUND THE DARK CORNERS HE CAME TO A STAND ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE PAVEMENT AND WAITED HIS EXERCISED EYES HAD MADE OUT IN THE CONFUSED MOVEMENTS OF LIGHTS AND SHADOWS THRONGING THE ROADWAY
780-126736-0097 THE CRAWLING APPROACH OF A HANSOM HE GAVE NO SIGN BUT WHEN THE LOW STEP GLIDING ALONG THE CURBSTONE CAME TO HIS FEET HE DODGED IN SKILFULLY IN FRONT OF THE BIG TURNING WHEEL AND SPOKE UP THROUGH THE LITTLE TRAP DOOR
780-126736-0098 IT WAS NOT A LONG DRIVE IT ENDED BY SIGNAL ABRUPTLY NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR BETWEEN TWO LAMP POSTS BEFORE A LARGE DRAPERY ESTABLISHMENT A LONG RANGE OF SHOPS ALREADY LAPPED UP IN SHEETS OF CORRUGATED IRON FOR THE NIGHT
780-126736-0099 TENDERING A COIN THROUGH THE TRAP DOOR THE FARE SLIPPED OUT AND AWAY LEAVING AN EFFECT OF UNCANNY ECCENTRIC GHASTLINESS UPON THE DRIVER'S MIND BUT THE SIZE OF THE COIN WAS SATISFACTORY TO HIS TOUCH AND HIS EDUCATION NOT BEING LITERARY
780-126736-0100 HE REMAINED UNTROUBLED BY THE FEAR OF FINDING IT PRESENTLY TURNED TO A DEAD LEAF IN HIS POCKET
780-126736-0101 HE CONTEMPLATED THEIR ACTIONS WITH A LIMITED INTEREST THE SHARP PULLING OF HIS HORSE RIGHT ROUND EXPRESSED HIS PHILOSOPHY MEANTIME THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WAS ALREADY GIVING HIS ORDER TO A WAITER IN A LITTLE ITALIAN RESTAURANT ROUND THE CORNER
780-126736-0102 ONE OF THOSE TRAPS FOR THE HUNGRY LONG AND NARROW BAITED WITH A PERSPECTIVE OF MIRRORS AND WHITE NAPERY WITHOUT AIR BUT WITH AN ATMOSPHERE OF THEIR OWN AN ATMOSPHERE OF FRAUDULENT COOKERY
780-126736-0103 MOCKING AN ABJECT MANKIND IN THE MOST PRESSING OF ITS MISERABLE NECESSITIES IN THIS IMMORAL ATMOSPHERE THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER REFLECTING UPON HIS ENTERPRISE SEEMED TO LOSE SOME MORE OF HIS IDENTITY HE HAD A SENSE OF LONELINESS
780-126736-0104 OF EVIL FREEDOM IT WAS RATHER PLEASANT WHEN AFTER PAYING FOR HIS SHORT MEAL HE STOOD UP AND WAITED FOR HIS CHANGE HE SAW HIMSELF IN THE SHEET OF GLASS AND WAS STRUCK
780-126736-0105 THEN BY SUDDEN INSPIRATION RAISED THE COLLAR OF HIS JACKET THIS ARRANGEMENT APPEARED TO HIM COMMENDABLE
780-126736-0106 HE WAS SATISFIED BY THE SUBTLE MODIFICATION
780-126736-0107 HE THOUGHT I'LL GET A LITTLE WET A LITTLE SPLASHED HE BECAME AWARE OF THE WAITER AT HIS ELBOW AND OF A SMALL PILE OF SILVER COINS ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE BEFORE HIM THE WAITER KEPT ONE EYE ON IT
780-126736-0108 WHO PASSED UP TO A DISTANT TABLE LOOKING PERFECTLY SIGHTLESS AND ALTOGETHER UNAPPROACHABLE SHE SEEMED TO BE A HABITUAL CUSTOMER ON GOING OUT
780-126736-0109 ALL THEIR NATIONAL AND PRIVATE CHARACTERISTICS AND THIS WAS STRANGE SINCE THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT IS SUCH A PECULIARLY BRITISH INSTITUTION BUT THESE PEOPLE
780-126736-0110 DISHES SET BEFORE THEM WITH EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF UNSTAMPED RESPECTABILITY NEITHER WAS THEIR PERSONALITY STAMPED IN ANY WAY PROFESSIONALLY SOCIALLY OR RACIALLY THEY SEEMED CREATED FOR THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT
780-126736-0111 UNLESS THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT HAD BEEN PERCHANCE CREATED FOR THEM BUT THAT LAST HYPOTHESIS WAS UNTHINKABLE SINCE ONE COULD NOT PLACE THEM ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THOSE SPECIAL ESTABLISHMENTS
780-126736-0112 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM A PRECISE IDEA WHAT OCCUPATIONS THEY FOLLOWED BY DAY AND WHERE THEY WENT TO BED AT NIGHT AND HE HIMSELF HAD BECOME UNPLACED
780-126736-0113 A PLEASURABLE FEELING OF INDEPENDENCE POSSESSED HIM WHEN HE HEARD THE GLASS DOORS SWING TO BEHIND HIS BACK WITH A SORT OF IMPERFECT BAFFLED THUD HE ADVANCED AT ONCE INTO AN IMMENSITY OF GREASY SLIME
780-126736-0114 AND DAMP PLASTER INTERSPERSED WITH LAMPS AND ENVELOPED OPPRESSED PENETRATED CHOKED AND SUFFOCATED BY THE BLACKNESS OF A WET LONDON NIGHT WHICH IS COMPOSED OF SOOT AND DROPS OF WATER
780-126736-0115 BRETT STREET WAS NOT VERY FAR AWAY IT BRANCHED OFF NARROW FROM THE SIDE OF AN OPEN TRIANGULAR SPACE
780-126736-0116 TEMPLES OF PETTY COMMERCE EMPTIED OF TRADERS FOR THE NIGHT ONLY A FRUITERER'S STALL AT THE CORNER MADE A VIOLENT BLAZE OF LIGHT AND COLOUR BEYOND ALL WAS BLACK AND THE FEW PEOPLE PASSING IN THAT DIRECTION VANISHED AT ONE STRIDE
780-126736-0117 BEYOND THE GLOWING HEAPS OF ORANGES AND LEMONS NO FOOTSTEPS ECHOED THEY WOULD NEVER BE HEARD OF AGAIN THE ADVENTUROUS HEAD OF THE SPECIAL CRIMES DEPARTMENT WATCHED THESE DISAPPEARANCES FROM A DISTANCE WITH AN INTERESTED EYE HE FELT LIGHT HEARTED
780-126736-0118 THIS JOYOUSNESS AND DISPERSION OF THOUGHT BEFORE A TASK OF SOME IMPORTANCE SEEMS TO PROVE THAT THIS WORLD OF OURS IS NOT SUCH A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR AFTER ALL FOR THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WAS NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY INCLINED TO LEVITY
780-126736-0119 THE POLICEMAN ON THE BEAT PROJECTED HIS SOMBRE AND MOVING FORM AGAINST THE LUMINOUS GLORY OF ORANGES AND LEMONS AND ENTERED BRETT STREET WITHOUT HASTE THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER AS THOUGH HE WERE A MEMBER OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES
780-126736-0120 LINGERED OUT OF SIGHT AWAITING HIS RETURN BUT THIS CONSTABLE SEEMED TO BE LOST FOR EVER TO THE FORCE HE NEVER RETURNED MUST HAVE GONE OUT AT THE OTHER END OF BRETT STREET THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER REACHING THIS CONCLUSION ENTERED THE STREET IN HIS TURN
780-126736-0121 AND CAME UPON A LARGE VAN ARRESTED IN FRONT OF THE DIMLY LIT WINDOW PANES OF A CARTER'S EATING HOUSE THE MAN WAS REFRESHING HIMSELF INSIDE AND THE HORSES THEIR BIG HEADS LOWERED TO THE GROUND FED OUT OF NOSE BAGS STEADILY FARTHER ON
780-126736-0122 ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET ANOTHER SUSPECT PATCH OF DIM LIGHT ISSUED FROM MISTER VERLOC'S SHOP FRONT HUNG WITH PAPERS HEAVING WITH VAGUE PILES OF CARDBOARD BOXES AND THE SHAPES OF BOOKS THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
780-126736-0123 STOOD OBSERVING IT ACROSS THE ROADWAY THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE BY THE SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDOW ENCUMBERED BY THE SHADOWS OF NONDESCRIPT THINGS THE DOOR STANDING AJAR
780-126736-0124 LET ESCAPE ON THE PAVEMENT A NARROW CLEAR STREAK OF GAS LIGHT WITHIN BEHIND THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THE VAN AND HORSES MERGED INTO ONE MASS SEEMED SOMETHING ALIVE
780-126736-0125 A SQUARE BACKED BLACK MONSTER BLOCKING HALF THE STREET WITH SUDDEN IRON SHOD STAMPINGS FIERCE JINGLES AND HEAVY BLOWING SIGHS THE HARSHLY FESTIVE ILL OMENED GLARE OF A LARGE AND PROSPEROUS PUBLIC HOUSE FACED THE OTHER END OF BRETT STREET ACROSS A WIDE ROAD
780-126736-0126 THIS BARRIER OF BLAZING LIGHTS OPPOSING THE SHADOWS GATHERED ABOUT THE HUMBLE ABODE OF MISTER VERLOC'S DOMESTIC HAPPINESS SEEMED TO DRIVE THE OBSCURITY OF THE STREET BACK UPON ITSELF MAKE IT MORE SULLEN BROODING
