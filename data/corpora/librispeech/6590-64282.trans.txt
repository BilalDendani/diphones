6590-64282-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN LYDGATE STEET LETTY'S WHOLE LIFE WAS NOW GATHERED ABOUT HER BOY AND SHE THOUGHT LITTLE COMPARATIVELY ABOUT TOM AND TOM THOUGHT SO LITTLE ABOUT HER THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE
6590-64282-0001 BUT IT WAS EVER WITH MORE OF A GRUDGE THAT HE GAVE IT THE INFLUENCE OVER HIM OF SEPIA WAS SCARCELY LESS NOW THAT SHE WAS GONE BUT IF SHE CARED FOR HIM AT ALL IT WAS MAINLY THAT
6590-64282-0002 FOR LIKE MACBETH HE HAD BEGUN ALREADY TO CONSIDER LIFE BUT A POOR AFFAIR ACROSS THE CLOUD OF THIS DEATH GLEAMED CERTAINLY THE FLASHING OF SEPIA'S EYES OR THE SOFTLY INFOLDING DAWN OF HER SMILE
6590-64282-0003 BUT ONLY THE NEXT HOUR NAY THE NEXT MOMENT TO LEAVE ALL DARKER THAN BEFORE PRECIOUS IS THE FAVOR OF ANY TRUE GOOD WOMAN BE SHE WHAT ELSE SHE MAY BUT WHAT IS THE FAVOR OF ONE WITHOUT HEART OR FAITH OR SELF GIVING
6590-64282-0004 YET IS THERE TESTIMONY ONLY TOO STRONG AND TERRIBLE TO THE DEMONIACAL POWER ENSLAVING AND ABSORBING AS THE ARMS OF THE KRAKEN OF AN EVIL WOMAN OVER AN IMAGINATIVE YOUTH POSSIBLY DID HE KNOW BEFOREHAND HER NATURE HE WOULD NOT LOVE HER
6590-64282-0005 CALLS HER THE WORST OF NAMES YET CAN NOT OR WILL NOT TEAR HIMSELF FREE
6590-64282-0006 AND HATES HER THRALLDOM HAPPILY TOM HAD NOT REACHED THIS DEPTH OF PERDITION SEPIA WAS PRUDENT FOR HERSELF AND KNEW NONE BETTER WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT SO FAR AS THE NEAR FUTURE WAS CONCERNED THEREFORE HELD HIM AT ARM'S LENGTH
6590-64282-0007 WHERE TOM BASKED IN A LIGHT THAT WAS OF HELL FOR WHAT IS A HELL OR A WOMAN LIKE SEPIA BUT AN INVERTED CREATION HIS NATURE IN CONSEQUENCE WAS IN ALL DIRECTIONS DISSOLVING HE DRANK MORE AND MORE STRONG DRINK
6590-64282-0008 FITTING FUEL TO SUCH HIS PASSION AND SEPIA LIKED TO SEE HIM APPROACH WITH HIS EYES BLAZING THERE ARE NOT MANY WOMEN LIKE HER SHE IS A RARE TYPE
6590-64282-0009 IF ONE OF THEM BE ACTUALLY ON THE PATH AND TO THE PHILOSOPHER A POSSIBILITY IS A FACT BUT THE TRUE VALUE OF THE STUDY OF ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT IS THAT IN THE DEEPEST SENSE SUCH DEVELOPMENT IS NOT ABNORMAL AT ALL
6590-64282-0010 BUT THE PERFECTED RESULT OF THE LAWS THAT AVENGE LAW BREACH IT IS IN AND THROUGH SUCH THAT WE GET GLIMPSES DOWN THE GULF OF A MORAL VOLCANO TO THE INFERNAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE HUMAN THE LAWLESS ROT OF THAT WHICH
6590-64282-0011 IN ITS ATTAINABLE IDEA IS NOTHING LESS THAN DIVINE IMAGINED FORESEEN CHERISHED AND LABORED FOR BY THE FATHER OF THE HUMAN
6590-64282-0012 SUCH INVERTED POSSIBILITY THE INFERNAL POSSIBILITY I MEAN LIES LATENT IN EVERY ONE OF US AND EXCEPT WE STIR OURSELVES UP TO THE RIGHT WILL GRADUALLY FROM A POSSIBILITY BECOME AN ENERGY THE WISE MAN DARES NOT YIELD TO A TEMPTATION
6590-64282-0013 WERE IT ONLY FOR THE TERROR THAT IF HE DO HE WILL YIELD THE MORE READILY AGAIN THE COMMONPLACE CRITIC WHO RECOGNIZES LIFE SOLELY UPON HIS OWN CONSCIOUS LEVEL MOCKS EQUALLY AT THE IDEAL AND ITS ANTIPODE
6590-64282-0014 INCAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING THE ART OF SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF AS TRUE TO THE HUMAN NATURE THAT WILL NOT BE HUMAN I HAVE SAID THAT LETTY DID HER BEST WITH WHAT MONEY TOM GAVE HER BUT WHEN SHE CAME TO FIND THAT HE HAD NOT PAID THE LODGING FOR TWO MONTHS
6590-64282-0015 THAT THE PAYMENT OF VARIOUS THINGS HE HAD TOLD HER TO ORDER AND HE WOULD SEE TO HAD BEEN NEGLECTED AND THAT THE TRADESPEOPLE WERE GETTING PERSISTENT IN THEIR APPLICATIONS THAT WHEN SHE TOLD HIM ANYTHING OF THE SORT HE TREATED IT AT ONE TIME AS A MATTER OF NO CONSEQUENCE
6590-64282-0016 AND A SEA OF TROUBLES SHE FELT AS IF SHE LAY ALREADY IN THE DEPTHS OF A DEBTOR'S JAIL THEREFORE SPARING AS SHE HAD BEEN FROM THE FIRST SHE WAS MORE SPARING THAN EVER NOT ONLY WOULD SHE BUY NOTHING FOR WHICH SHE COULD NOT PAY DOWN
6590-64282-0017 HAVING OFTEN IN CONSEQUENCE TO GO WITHOUT PROPER FOOD
6590-64282-0018 SHE GREW VERY THIN AND IN DEED IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN OF THE HEALTHIEST COULD NOT HAVE STOOD HER OWN TREATMENT MANY WEEKS HER BABY SOON BEGAN TO SHOW SUFFERING BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE HER ALTER HER WAY OR DRIVE HER TO APPEAL TO TOM
6590-64282-0019 SHE WAS IGNORANT OF THE SIMPLEST THINGS A MOTHER NEEDS TO KNOW AND NEVER IMAGINED HER ABSTINENCE COULD HURT HER BABY SO LONG AS SHE WENT ON NURSING HIM IT WAS ALL THE SAME SHE THOUGHT
6590-64282-0020 HE CRIED SO MUCH THAT TOM MADE IT A REASON WITH HIMSELF AND INDEED GAVE IT AS ONE TO LETTY FOR NOT COMING HOME AT NIGHT
6590-64282-0021 THE BABY WENT ON CRYING AND THE MOTHER'S HEART WAS TORN THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE SAID HE MUST BE ALREADY CUTTING HIS TEETH AND RECOMMENDED SOME DEVILISH SIRUP LETTY BOUGHT A BOTTLE WITH THE NEXT MONEY SHE GOT AND THOUGHT IT DID HIM GOOD BECAUSE LESSENING HIS APPETITE
6590-64282-0022 IT LESSENED HIS CRYING AND ALSO MADE HIM SLEEP MORE THAN HE OUGHT
6590-64282-0023 THEREAT IN LETTY SPRANG UP THE MOTHER ERECT AND FIERCE SHE DARTED TO TOM SNATCHED THE CHILD FROM HIS ARMS AND TURNED TO CARRY HIM TO THE INNER ROOM BUT AS THE MOTHER ROSE IN LETTY THE DEVIL ROSE IN TOM
6590-64282-0024 IF WHAT FOLLOWED WAS NOT THE DOING OF THE REAL TOM IT WAS THE DOING OF THE DEVIL TO WHOM THE REAL TOM HAD OPENED THE DOOR WITH ONE STRIDE HE OVERTOOK HIS WIFE AND MOTHER AND CHILD LAY TOGETHER ON THE FLOOR I MUST SAY FOR HIM THAT
6590-64282-0025 EVEN IN HIS DRUNKENNESS HE DID NOT STRIKE HIS WIFE AS HE WOULD HAVE STRUCK A MAN IT WAS AN OPEN HANDED BLOW HE GAVE HER WHAT IN FAMILIAR LANGUAGE IS CALLED A BOX ON THE EAR BUT FOR DAYS SHE CARRIED THE RECORD OF IT ON HER CHEEK IN FIVE RED FINGER MARKS
6590-64282-0026 WHEN HE SAW HER ON THE FLOOR TOM'S BEDAZED MIND CAME TO ITSELF
6590-64282-0027 BUT ALAS EVEN THEN HE THOUGHT MORE OF THE WRONG HE HAD DONE TO HIMSELF AS A GENTLEMAN THAN OF THE GRIEVOUS WOUND HE HAD GIVEN HIS WIFE'S HEART
6590-64282-0028 AND LAID HIM ON THE RUG THEN LIFTED THE BITTERLY WEEPING LETTY
6590-64282-0029 NOT HUMBLY TO ENTREAT HER PARDON BUT AS WAS HIS WONT TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF BY PROVING THAT ALL THE BLAME WAS HERS AND THAT SHE HAD WRONGED HIM GREATLY IN DRIVING HIM TO DO SUCH A THING
6590-64282-0030 THIS FOR APOLOGY POOR LETTY NEVER HAVING HAD FROM HIM FULLER ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF WRONG WAS FAIN TO ACCEPT SHE TURNED ON THE SOFA THREW HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK
6590-64282-0031 AND THE DOCTOR COULD DISCOVER NO INJURY FROM THE FALL THEY TOLD HIM HE HAD HAD AT THE SAME TIME HE SAID HE WAS NOT PROPERLY NOURISHED AND MUST HAVE BETTER FOOD THIS WAS A FRESH DIFFICULTY TO LETTY IT WAS A CALL FOR MORE OUTLAY AND NOW THEIR LANDLADY
6590-64282-0032 WHO HAD THROUGHOUT BEEN VERY KIND WAS IN TROUBLE ABOUT HER OWN RENT AND BEGAN TO PRESS FOR PART AT LEAST OF THEIRS
6590-64282-0033 SHE FORGOT THAT THERE WAS A THING CALLED JOY SO SAD SHE LOOKED THAT THE GOOD WOMAN FULL OF PITY ASSURED HER THAT COME WHAT MIGHT
6590-64282-0034 BUT AT THE WORST WOULD ONLY HAVE TO GO A STORY HIGHER TO INFERIOR ROOMS THE RENT SHOULD WAIT SHE SAID UNTIL BETTER DAYS BUT THIS KINDNESS RELIEVED LETTY ONLY A LITTLE FOR THE RENT PAST AND THE RENT TO COME HUNG UPON HER LIKE A CLOAK OF LEAD
6590-64282-0035 NOR WAS EVEN DEBT THE WORST THAT NOW OPPRESSED HER FOR POSSIBLY FROM THE FALL BUT MORE FROM THE PROLONGED WANT OF SUITABLE NOURISHMENT AND WISE TREATMENT AFTER THAT TERRIBLE NIGHT THE BABY GREW WORSE
6590-64282-0036 MANY WERE THE TEARS THE SLEEPLESS MOTHER SHED OVER THE SALLOW FACE AND WASTED LIMBS OF HER SLUMBERING TREASURE HER ONE ANTIDOTE TO COUNTLESS SORROWS AND MANY WERE THE FOOLISH MEANS SHE TRIED TO RESTORE HIS SINKING VITALITY
6590-64282-0037 MARY HAD WRITTEN TO HER AND SHE HAD WRITTEN TO MARY
6590-64282-0038 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO BRING BLAME UPON TOM BUT MARY WITH HER FINE HUMAN INSTINCT FELT THAT THINGS MUST BE GOING WORSE WITH HER THAN BEFORE AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HER RETURN WAS INDEFINITELY POSTPONED BY MISTER REDMAIN'S ILLNESS SHE VENTURED AT LAST
6590-64282-0039 WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT NOW BE TIME TO LET BYGONES BE BYGONES AND MAKE SOME INQUIRY CONCERNING HER TO THIS LETTER GODFREY RETURNED NO ANSWER
6590-64282-0040 HE TOOK IT THEREFORE AS A PIECE OF UTTER PRESUMPTION IN MARY TO WRITE TO HIM ABOUT LETTY AND THAT IN THE TONE AS HE INTERPRETED IT OF ONE READING HIM A LESSON OF DUTY BUT WHILE HE WAS THUS INDIGNANT WITH MARY
6590-64282-0041 HE WAS ALSO VEXED WITH LETTY THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HERSELF HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM IF SHE WAS IN ANY NEED FORGETTING THAT HE HAD NEVER HINTED AT ANY DOOR OF COMMUNICATION OPEN BETWEEN HIM AND HER HIS HEART QUIVERED AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT BE IN DISTRESS
6590-64282-0042 HE HAD KNOWN FOR CERTAIN HE SAID THE FOOL WOULD BRING HER TO MISERY FOR HIMSELF THE THOUGHT OF LETTY WAS AN EVER OPEN WOUND WITH AN EVER PRESENT PAIN
6590-64282-0043 NOW KEEN AND STINGING THE AGONY OF HER DESERTION HE SAID WOULD NEVER CEASE GNAWING AT HIS HEART UNTIL IT WAS LAID IN THE GRAVE
6590-64282-0044 BUT WHILE THUS HE BROODED A FIERCE AND EVIL JOY AWOKE IN HIM AT THE THOUGHT THAT NOW AT LAST THE EXPECTED HOUR HAD COME WHEN HE WOULD HEAP COALS OF FIRE ON HER HEAD HE WAS STILL FOOL ENOUGH TO THINK OF HER AS HAVING FORSAKEN HIM
6590-64282-0045 ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER GIVEN HER GROUND FOR BELIEVING AND SHE HAD NEVER HAD CONCEIT ENOUGH TO IMAGINE THAT HE CARED THE LEAST FOR HER PERSON
6590-64282-0046 SHE KNEW WHAT SHE HAD GAINED IN TOM HELMER HE PASSED A TROUBLED NIGHT DREAMED PAINFULLY AND STARTED AWAKE TO RENEWED PAIN
