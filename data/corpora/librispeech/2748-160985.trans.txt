2748-160985-0000 THE STAR WIFE IN THE DAYS WHEN THE BUFFALO RACED AND THUNDERED OVER THE EARTH AND THE STARS DANCED AND SANG IN THE SKY A BRAVE YOUNG HUNTER LIVED ON THE BANK OF BATTLE RIVER
2748-160985-0001 HE WAS FOND OF THE RED FLOWERS AND THE BLUE SKY AND WHEN THE REST OF THE INDIANS WENT OUT TO HUNT IN WAISTCLOTHS OF SKIN HE PUT ON HIS FRINGED LEGGINGS ALL HEAVY WITH BLUE BEADS AND PAINTED RED RINGS AND STRIPES ON HIS FACE
2748-160985-0002 TILL HE WAS AS GAY AS THE EARTH AND THE SKY HIMSELF HIGH FEATHER WAS HIS NAME AND HE ALWAYS WORE A RED SWAN'S FEATHER ON HIS HEAD ONE DAY
2748-160985-0003 WHEN HIGH FEATHER WAS OUT WITH HIS BOW AND ARROWS HE CAME ON A LITTLE BEATEN TRAIL THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND HE FOLLOWED IT BUT HE FOUND THAT IT WENT ROUND AND ROUND
2748-160985-0004 IT CAME FROM NOWHERE AND IT WENT TO NOWHERE WHAT SORT OF ANIMAL HAS MADE THIS HE SAID AND HE LAY DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RING TO THINK LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY WHILE HE LAY THINKING
2748-160985-0005 HE SAW A LITTLE SPECK UP ABOVE HIM IN THE SKY AND THOUGHT IT WAS AN EAGLE BUT THE SPECK GREW BIGGER AND SANK DOWN AND DOWN TILL HE SAW IT WAS A GREAT BASKET COMING DOWN OUT OF THE SKY HE JUMPED UP
2748-160985-0006 AND RAN BACK TO A LITTLE HOLLOW AND LAY DOWN TO HIDE IN A PATCH OF TALL RED FLOWERS THEN HE PEEPED OUT AND SAW THE BASKET COME DOWN TO THE EARTH AND REST ON THE GRASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RING TWELVE BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS
2748-160985-0007 WERE LEANING OVER THE EDGE OF THE BASKET THEY WERE NOT INDIAN MAIDENS FOR THEIR FACES WERE PINK AND WHITE AND THEIR LONG HAIR WAS BRIGHT RED BROWN LIKE A FOX'S FUR AND THEIR CLOTHES WERE SKY BLUE AND FLOATING LIGHT AS COBWEBS
2748-160985-0008 THE MAIDENS JUMPED OUT OF THE BASKET AND BEGAN TO DANCE ROUND AND ROUND THE RING TRAIL ONE BEHIND THE OTHER DRUMMING WITH THEIR FINGERS ON LITTLE DRUMS OF EAGLE SKIN AND SINGING SUCH BEAUTIFUL SONGS AS HIGH FEATHER HAD NEVER HEARD
2748-160985-0009 THEN HIGH FEATHER JUMPED UP AND RAN TOWARDS THE RING CRYING OUT LET ME DANCE AND SING WITH YOU THE MAIDENS WERE FRIGHTENED AND RAN TO THE BASKET AND JUMPED IN AND THE BASKET FLEW UP INTO THE SKY
2748-160985-0010 AND GREW SMALLER TILL AT LAST HE COULD NOT SEE IT AT ALL THE YOUNG MAN WENT HOME TO HIS WIGWAM
2748-160985-0011 BUT HE COULD NOT EAT AND HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING BUT THE TWELVE BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS HIS MOTHER BEGGED HIM TO TELL HER WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND AT LAST HE TOLD HER AND SAID HE WOULD NEVER BE HAPPY TILL HE BROUGHT ONE OF THE MAIDENS HOME TO BE HIS WIFE
2748-160985-0012 THOSE MUST BE THE STAR PEOPLE SAID HIS MOTHER WHO WAS A GREAT MAGICIAN THE PRAIRIE WAS FULL OF MAGIC IN THOSE DAYS BEFORE THE WHITE MAN CAME AND THE BUFFALO WENT YOU HAD BETTER TAKE AN INDIAN GIRL FOR YOUR WIFE

2748-160985-0014 IF YOU MUST YOU MUST SAID HIS MOTHER SO NEXT MORNING SHE SEWED A BIT OF GOPHER'S FUR ON TO HIS FEATHER AND HE ATE A GOOD BREAKFAST OF BUFFALO MEAT AND TRAMPED AWAY OVER THE PRAIRIE TO THE DANCING RING
2748-160985-0015 AS SOON AS HE CAME INTO THE RING HE TURNED INTO A GOPHER BUT THERE WERE NO GOPHERS HOLES THERE FOR HIM TO HIDE IN SO HE HAD TO LIE IN THE GRASS AND WAIT PRESENTLY HE SAW A SPECK UP IN THE SKY
2748-160985-0016 AND THE SPECK GREW LARGER AND LARGER TILL IT BECAME A BASKET AND THE BASKET CAME DOWN AND DOWN TILL IT RESTED ON THE EARTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RING THE ELDEST MAIDEN PUT HER HEAD OVER THE EDGE AND LOOKED ALL AROUND
2748-160985-0017 NORTH AND EAST AND SOUTH AND WEST THERE IS NO MAN HERE SHE SAID SO THEY ALL JUMPED OUT TO HAVE THEIR DANCE BUT BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE BEATEN RING THE YOUNGEST MAIDEN SPIED THE GOPHER AND CALLED OUT TO HER SISTERS TO LOOK AT IT
2748-160985-0018 AWAY AWAY CRIED THE ELDEST MAIDEN NO GOPHER WOULD DARE TO COME ON OUR DANCING GROUND IT IS A CONJUROR IN DISGUISE SO SHE TOOK HER YOUNGEST SISTER BY THE ARM AND PULLED HER AWAY TO THE BASKET AND THEY ALL JUMPED IN
2748-160985-0019 AND THE BASKET WENT SAILING UP INTO THE SKY BEFORE HIGH FEATHER COULD GET OUT OF HIS GOPHER SKIN OR SAY A WORD THE YOUNG MAN WENT HOME VERY MISERABLE BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE SAID
2748-160985-0020 IT IS A HARD THING YOU WANT TO DO BUT IF YOU MUST YOU MUST TO NIGHT I WILL MAKE SOME FRESH MAGIC AND YOU CAN TRY AGAIN TO MORROW NEXT MORNING HIGH FEATHER ASKED FOR HIS BREAKFAST BUT HIS MOTHER SAID
2748-160985-0021 YOU MUST NOT HAVE ANY BUFFALO MEAT OR IT WILL SPOIL THE MAGIC YOU MUST NOT EAT ANYTHING BUT THE WILD STRAWBERRIES YOU FIND ON THE PRAIRIE AS YOU GO THEN SHE SEWED A LITTLE BIT OF A MOUSE'S WHISKER ON TO HIS RED FEATHER
2748-160985-0022 AND HE TRAMPED AWAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIE PICKING WILD STRAWBERRIES AND EATING THEM AS HE WENT TILL HE CAME TO THE DANCING RING AS SOON AS HE WAS INSIDE THE RING HE TURNED INTO A LITTLE MOUSE AND MADE FRIENDS WITH THE FAMILY OF MICE
2748-160985-0023 THAT LIVED IN A HOLE UNDER THE GRASS AND THE MOTHER MOUSE PROMISED TO HELP HIM ALL SHE COULD THEY HAD NOT WAITED LONG

2748-160985-0025 SO THEY ALL GOT OUT OF THE BASKET AND BEGAN TO DANCE ROUND THE RING DRUMMING AND SINGING AS THEY WENT BUT WHEN THEY CAME NEAR THE MOUSE'S NEST THE ELDEST SISTER HELD UP HER HAND AND THEY STOPPED DANCING AND HELD THEIR BREATH
2748-160985-0026 THEN SHE TAPPED ON THE GROUND AND LISTENED IT DOES NOT SOUND SO HOLLOW AS IT DID SHE SAID THE MICE HAVE A VISITOR AND SHE TAPPED AGAIN AND CALLED OUT COME AND SHOW YOURSELVES YOU LITTLE TRAITORS OR WE WILL DIG YOU UP
2748-160985-0027 BUT THE MOTHER MOUSE HAD MADE ANOTHER DOOR TO HER NEST JUST OUTSIDE THE RING WORKING VERY FAST WITH ALL HER TOES AND WHILE THE MAIDENS WERE LOOKING FOR HER INSIDE THE RING SHE CAME OUT AT THE OTHER DOOR WITH ALL HER CHILDREN
2748-160985-0028 AND SCAMPERED AWAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIE THE MAIDENS TURNED ROUND AND RAN AFTER THEM ALL BUT THE YOUNGEST SISTER WHO DID NOT WANT ANY ONE TO BE KILLED AND HIGH FEATHER CAME OUT OF THE HOLE AND TURNED HIMSELF INTO WHAT HE WAS AND CAUGHT HER BY THE ARM
2748-160985-0029 COME HOME AND MARRY ME HE SAID AND DANCE WITH THE INDIAN MAIDENS AND I WILL HUNT FOR YOU

2748-160985-0031 SO THE OTHER MAIDENS WENT WEEPING AND WAILING UP INTO THE SKY AND HIGH FEATHER TOOK HIS STAR WIFE HOME TO HIS TENT ON THE BANK OF THE BATTLE RIVER HIGH FEATHER'S MOTHER WAS GLAD TO SEE THEM BOTH BUT SHE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
2748-160985-0032 YOU MUST TAKE HER WITH YOU EVERYWHERE YOU GO AND HE DID SO HE TOOK HER WITH HIM EVERY TIME HE WENT HUNTING AND HE MADE HER A BOW AND ARROWS BUT SHE WOULD NEVER USE THEM

2748-160985-0034 WHILE THE YOUNG MAN'S WIFE WAS EMBROIDERING FEATHER STARS ON A DANCING CLOTH AND HIS MOTHER WAS GOSSIPING IN A TENT
2748-160985-0035 A LITTLE YELLOW BIRD FLEW IN AND PERCHED ON HIGH FEATHER'S SHOULDER AND WHISPERED IN HIS EAR THERE IS A GREAT FLOCK OF WILD RED SWANS JUST OVER ON LOON LAKE IF YOU COME QUICKLY AND QUIETLY YOU CAN CATCH THEM BEFORE THEY FLY AWAY

2748-160985-0037 HE LOOKED AT HIS WIFE AND AS SHE WAS SEWING BUSILY AND LOOKING DOWN AT HER STAR EMBROIDERING HE THOUGHT HE COULD SLIP AWAY AND GET BACK BEFORE SHE KNEW HE HAD GONE BUT AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
2748-160985-0038 THE LITTLE YELLOW BIRD FLEW IN AND PERCHED ON HER SHOULDER AND SANG HER SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG ABOUT HER SISTERS IN THE SKY THAT SHE FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND SLIPPED OUT AND RAN LIKE THE WIND AND GOT TO THE DANCING RING
2748-160985-0039 JUST AS HER SISTERS CAME DOWN IN THEIR BASKET THEN THEY ALL GATHERED ROUND HER AND BEGGED HER TO GO HOME WITH THEM BUT SHE ONLY SAID HIGH FEATHER IS A BRAVE MAN AND HE IS VERY GOOD TO ME AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE HIM

2748-160985-0046 NOW WHEN HIGH FEATHER REACHED LOON LAKE HE FOUND IT COVERED WITH RED SWANS HE SHOT TWO WITH ONE ARROW AND THEN ALL THE REST FLEW AWAY HE PICKED UP THE TWO SWANS AND HURRIED BACK TO HIS TENT AND THERE LAY THE DANCING CLOTH
2748-160985-0047 WITH THE FEATHER STARS ON IT HALF FINISHED BUT NO WIFE COULD HE SEE HE CALLED HER BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER HE RUSHED OUT WITH THE TWO RED SWANS STILL SLUNG ROUND HIS NECK AND HANGING DOWN HIS BACK AND RAN TO THE DANCING RING BUT NOBODY WAS THERE
2748-160985-0048 I WILL WAIT TILL SHE COMES BACK HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF I HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE WORLD ENDS SO HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON THE GRASS AND LAY LOOKING UP AT THE STARS TILL HE WENT TO SLEEP EARLY IN THE MORNING

2748-160985-0052 THE YOUNG MAN SAID NOTHING BUT HE PUT ON THE WINGS OF ONE OF THE RED SWANS AND HE PUT THE OTHER RED SWAN'S WINGS ON HIS WIFE AND THEY LEAPT OVER THE EDGE OF THE STAR COUNTRY AND FLEW DOWN THROUGH THE AIR TO THE PRAIRIE AND CAME TO THE TENT
2748-160985-0053 WHERE HIGH FEATHER'S MOTHER WAS MOURNING FOR THEM AND THERE WAS A GREAT FEAST IN THE VILLAGE BECAUSE THEY HAD COME BACK SAFE AND SOUND THE STAR WIFE FINISHED EMBROIDERING HER DANCING CLOTH THAT DAY AND WHENEVER THE INDIANS DANCED SHE DANCED WITH THEM
2748-160985-0054 SHE NEVER WENT BACK TO THE STAR MAIDENS DANCING RING BUT SHE STILL LIVED ON BERRIES AND CORN BECAUSE SHE WOULD NEVER KILL ANYTHING EXCEPT ONE THING AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE YELLOW BIRD
