8172-281511-0001 IT MAY BE A SOUND A TONE OF MUSIC SUMMER'S EVE OR SPRING A FLOWER THE WIND THE OCEAN
8172-281511-0002 BUT FEEL THE SHOCK RENEWED NOR CAN EFFACE THE BLIGHT AND BLACKENING WHICH IT LEAVES BEHIND
8172-281511-0003 WHICH OUT OF THINGS FAMILIAR UNDESIGNED WHEN LEAST WE DEEM OF SUCH CALLS UP TO VIEW THE SPECTRES WHOM NO EXORCISM CAN BIND THE COLD THE CHANGED PERCHANCE THE DEAD
8172-281511-0004 ANEW THE MOURNED THE LOVED THE LOST TOO MANY
8172-281511-0005 MY SOUL WANDERS I DEMAND IT BACK TO MEDITATE AMONGST DECAY AND STAND A RUIN AMIDST RUINS
8172-281511-0006 AND MUST EVER BE THE MASTER MOULD OF NATURE'S HEAVENLY HAND WHEREIN WERE CAST THE HEROIC AND THE FREE
8172-281511-0007 THY VERY WEEDS ARE BEAUTIFUL
8172-281511-0008 A SEA OF GLORY STREAMS ALONG THE ALPINE HEIGHT OF BLUE FRIULI'S MOUNTAINS HEAVEN IS FREE FROM CLOUDS BUT OF ALL COLOURS SEEMS TO BE
8172-281511-0009 MELTED TO ONE VAST IRIS OF THE WEST WHERE THE DAY JOINS THE PAST ETERNITY WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND
8172-281511-0010 AS DAY AND NIGHT CONTENDING WERE
8172-281511-0011 A PALER SHADOW STREWS ITS MANTLE O'ER THE MOUNTAINS PARTING DAY DIES LIKE THE DOLPHIN WHOM EACH PANG IMBUES WITH A NEW COLOUR AS IT GASPS AWAY THE LAST STILL LOVELIEST TILL
8172-281511-0012 REARED IN AIR PILLARED IN THEIR SARCOPHAGUS REPOSE THE BONES OF LAURA'S LOVER HERE REPAIR MANY FAMILIAR WITH HIS WELL SUNG WOES THE PILGRIMS OF HIS GENIUS
8172-281511-0013 HE AROSE TO RAISE A LANGUAGE AND HIS LAND RECLAIM FROM THE DULL YOKE OF HER BARBARIC FOES
8172-281511-0014 AND TIS THEIR PRIDE AN HONEST PRIDE AND LET IT BE THEIR PRAISE TO OFFER TO THE PASSING STRANGER'S GAZE HIS MANSION AND HIS SEPULCHRE BOTH PLAIN AND VENERABLY SIMPLE
8172-281511-0015 SUCH AS RAISE A FEELING MORE ACCORDANT WITH HIS STRAIN
8172-281511-0016 WHICH SHOWS A DISTANT PROSPECT FAR AWAY OF BUSY CITIES NOW IN VAIN DISPLAYED
8172-281511-0017 TIS SOLITUDE SHOULD TEACH US HOW TO DIE IT HATH NO FLATTERERS
8172-281511-0018 MAKING THE SUN LIKE BLOOD
8172-281511-0019 AND THEN SURVEY HIS CELL AND SEE HOW DEARLY EARNED TORQUATO'S FAME
8172-281511-0020 THE MISERABLE DESPOT COULD NOT QUELL THE INSULTED MIND HE SOUGHT TO QUENCH AND BLEND WITH THE SURROUNDING MANIACS IN THE HELL WHERE HE HAD PLUNGED IT
8172-281511-0021 WITH A GLORY ROUND HIS FURROWED BROW WHICH EMANATED THEN AND DAZZLES NOW IN FACE OF ALL HIS FOES THE CRUSCAN QUIRE
8172-281511-0022 BUT HOW LONG THE TIDE OF GENERATIONS SHALL ROLL ON AND NOT THE WHOLE COMBINED AND COUNTLESS THRONG COMPOSE A MIND LIKE THINE THOUGH ALL IN ONE CONDENSED THEIR SCATTERED RAYS
8172-281511-0023 YET PARALLELED BY THOSE THY COUNTRYMEN BEFORE THEE BORN TO SHINE THE BARDS OF HELL AND CHIVALRY FIRST ROSE THE TUSCAN FATHER'S COMEDY DIVINE
8172-281511-0024 THE SOUTHERN SCOTT THE MINSTREL WHO CALLED FORTH A NEW CREATION WITH HIS MAGIC LINE AND LIKE THE ARIOSTO OF THE NORTH SANG LADYE LOVE AND WAR
8172-281511-0025 NOR WAS THE OMINOUS ELEMENT UNJUST FOR THE TRUE LAUREL WREATH WHICH GLORY WEAVES IS OF THE TREE NO BOLT OF THUNDER CLEAVES AND THE FALSE SEMBLANCE BUT DISGRACED HIS BROW
