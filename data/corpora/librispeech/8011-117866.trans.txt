8011-117866-0000 MOTTO FOR THE MOTHER TEACH YOUR CHILD THAT EVERY ONE LOVES HIM WHEN HE'S GOOD AND TRUE BUT THAT THOUGH SO DEAR TO OTHERS HE IS DOUBLY DEAR TO YOU MISS BLOW'S MOTTOES AND COMMENTARIES
8011-117866-0001 LONG LONG AGO THERE LIVED IN A KINGDOM FAR AWAY FIVE KNIGHTS WHO WERE SO GOOD AND SO WISE THAT EACH ONE WAS KNOWN BY A NAME THAT MEANT SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL THE FIRST KNIGHT WAS CALLED SIR BRIAN THE BRAVE
8011-117866-0002 HE HAD KILLED THE GREAT LION THAT CAME OUT OF THE FOREST TO FRIGHTEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAD SLAIN A DRAGON AND HAD SAVED A PRINCESS FROM A BURNING CASTLE FOR HE WAS AFRAID OF NOTHING UNDER THE SUN THE SECOND KNIGHT WAS GERALD THE GLAD
8011-117866-0003 WHO WAS SO HAPPY HIMSELF THAT HE MADE EVERYBODY AROUND HIM HAPPY TOO FOR HIS SWEET SMILE AND CHEERY WORDS WERE SO COMFORTING THAT NONE COULD BE SAD OR CROSS OR ANGRY WHEN HE WAS NEAR SIR KENNETH THE KIND WAS THE THIRD KNIGHT
8011-117866-0004 BRING HIM IF HE WILL COME WILLINGLY TO ME AND I SHALL BE HAPPY IN MY OLD AGE
8011-117866-0005 AND AT THE FIRST PEEP OF DAY THEY WERE READY FOR THEIR JOURNEY AND RODE DOWN THE KING'S HIGHWAY WITH WAVING PLUMES AND SHINING SHIELDS
8011-117866-0006 SOME SAID THEIRS WERE SMART BUT AS THE KNIGHTS CARED NOTHING FOR A CHILD WHO WAS NOT GOOD THEY DID NOT HURRY TO SEE THESE CHILDREN ON THE SECOND DAY HOWEVER AS THEY RODE ALONG THEY MET A COMPANY OF MEN IN VERY FINE CLOTHES WHO BOWED DOWN BEFORE THEM
8011-117866-0007 AND WHILE THE KNIGHTS DREW REIN IN ASTONISHMENT A LITTLE MAN STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS TO SPEAK TO THEM HE WAS A FAT LITTLE MAN
8011-117866-0008 OF THE BARON BORRIBALD WHOSE SON FLORIMOND WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL CHILD IN THE WORLD OH THERE IS NOTHING HE CANNOT DO CRIED THE FAT LITTLE MAN WHOSE NAME WAS PUFF
8011-117866-0009 THE BARON AND BARONESS TOO WERE WELL PLEASED WITH THEIR VISITORS AND MADE A FEAST IN THEIR HONOR BUT EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THE KNIGHTS WERE STARTLED BY A MOST AWFUL SOUND WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE HALL BELOW
8011-117866-0010 IT SOUNDED SOMETHING LIKE THE HOWLING OF A DOG BUT AS THEY LISTENED IT GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER UNTIL IT SOUNDED LIKE THE ROARING OF A LION THE KNIGHTS SEIZED THEIR SWORDS AND RUSHED DOWN TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL STOOD FLORIMOND
8011-117866-0011 AND RIGHT OUT OF HIS OPEN MOUTH CAME THAT TERRIBLE NOISE
8011-117866-0012 THE COOK HAD RUN UP WITH A PIE AND THE NURSE WITH A TOY BUT FLORIMOND ONLY OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SCREAMED THE LOUDER BECAUSE THE RAIN WAS COMING DOWN WHEN HE WANTED TO PLAY OUT OF DOORS THEN THE KNIGHTS SAW THAT THEY WERE NOT WANTED
8011-117866-0013 AND THEY HURRIED UPSTAIRS TO PREPARE FOR THEIR JOURNEY THE BARON AND BARONESS AND FAT LITTLE PUFF ALL BEGGED THEM TO STAY AND FLORIMOND CRIED AGAIN WHEN THEY LEFT HIM BUT THE KNIGHTS DID NOT CARE TO STAY WITH A CHILD WHO WAS NOT GOOD
8011-117866-0014 TO TALK AND THEY DECIDED TO PART COMPANY LET EACH TAKE HIS OWN WAY SAID TRISTRAM THE TRUE AND TO MORROW WE WILL MEET UNDER THIS SAME TREE AND TELL WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE TIME DRAWS NEAR WHEN WE MUST RETURN TO THE KING
8011-117866-0015 THEN THEY BADE EACH OTHER FAREWELL AND EACH RODE AWAY EXCEPT SIR TRISTRAM WHO LINGERED LONG UNDER THE OAK TREE FOR HE WAS THE LEADER AND HAD MANY THINGS TO THINK ABOUT JUST AS THE SUN WAS RED IN THE WEST HE SAW A LITTLE BOY COMING TOWARDS HIM
8011-117866-0016 AND LEAD ME TO A PLEASANT PLACE WHERE I MAY REST TO NIGHT ASKED THE KNIGHT AY THAT I CAN
8011-117866-0017 BUT SIR TRISTRAM TOLD HIM TO RUN AND PROMISED TO WAIT PATIENTLY UNTIL HIS RETURN
8011-117866-0018 AND THE MOTHER CALLED FROM THE KITCHEN IS THAT MY SUNBEAM COMING HOME TO ROOST WHICH MADE GAUVAIN AND THE KNIGHT BOTH LAUGH THEN THE MOTHER CAME OUT IN HASTE TO WELCOME THE STRANGER AND SHE TREATED HIM WITH HONOR
8011-117866-0019 AND I EXCLAIMED KENNETH THE KIND AND I SAID BRIAN THE BRAVE AND I SAID PERCIVAL THE PURE AND THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN ASTONISHMENT I DO NOT KNOW THE CHILD'S NAME CONTINUED GERALD THE GLAD
8011-117866-0020 AND JUST AS I SAW THEM A LITTLE BOY RAN UP AS BRAVE AS A KNIGHT AND TOOK THE DOG IN HIS ARMS AND COVERED IT WITH HIS COAT THE REST RAN AWAY WHEN I RODE UP BUT THE CHILD STAYED AND TOLD ME HIS NAME
8011-117866-0021 AS THE CHILD REACHED DOWN BUT HE SPOKE NO ANGRY WORDS AND WAITED PATIENTLY TILL THE WATER WAS CLEAR AGAIN
8011-117866-0022 COME AND I WILL CARRY YOU TO THE CHILD AND WHEN THE KNIGHTS FOLLOWED HIM
8011-117866-0023 AS HAPPY AS A LARK AND AS GENTLE AS A DOVE IT WAS NOONDAY AND THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY ON THE SHIELDS OF THE KNIGHTS AND THEIR PLUMES WERE WAVING IN THE BREEZE
8011-117866-0024 SIR TRISTRAM BLEW A LOUD BLAST ON A SILVER TRUMPET THEN ALL THE HENS BEGAN TO CACKLE AND THE DOG BEGAN TO BARK AND THE HORSE BEGAN TO NEIGH AND THE PIGS BEGAN TO GRUNT FOR THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS A GREAT DAY
8011-117866-0025 WHEN THE KNIGHTS SAW GAUVAIN
8011-117866-0026 HE IS THE CHILD AND TRISTRAM THE TRUE SAID TO THE MOTHER GREETING TO YOU THE KING OUR WISE RULER HAS SENT US HERE TO SEE YOUR GOOD CHILD FOR A GOOD CHILD IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN A KINGDOM AND THE KING OFFERS HIM HIS LOVE AND FAVOR
8011-117866-0027 IF YOU WILL LET HIM RIDE WITH US TO LIVE AT THE KING'S COURT AND LEARN TO BE A KNIGHT LITTLE GAUVAIN AND HIS MOTHER WERE GREATLY ASTONISHED THEY COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT SUCH A THING HAD HAPPENED
8011-117866-0028 SHE MUST LIVE WITHOUT HIM THE ROOSTER UP ON THE FENCE CROWED A VERY LOUD
8011-117866-0029 SHE ANSWERED THE KNIGHTS AND SAID I CANNOT SPARE MY GOOD CHILD FROM MY HOME THE KING'S LOVE IS PRECIOUS BUT I LOVE MY CHILD MORE THAN THE WHOLE WORLD AND HE IS DEARER TO ME THAN A THOUSAND KINGDOMS LITTLE GAUVAIN WAS SO GLAD WHEN HE HEARD HER ANSWER
8011-117866-0030 THAT HE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE KNIGHTS WITH A SMILING FACE AND WAVED HIS HAND TO THEM AS THEY RODE AWAY ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT THEY RODE AND IT WAS THE PEEP OF DAY WHEN THEY CAME TO THE KING'S HIGHWAY THEN THEY RODE SLOWLY FOR THEY WERE SAD BECAUSE OF THEIR NEWS
8011-117866-0031 BUT THE KING REJOICED WHEN HE HEARD IT FOR HE SAID SUCH A CHILD WITH SUCH A MOTHER WILL GROW INTO A KNIGHT AT HOME THE KING'S WORDS WERE TRUE FOR WHEN THE KING WAS AN OLD OLD MAN
8011-117866-0032 GAUVAIN HAD A BEAUTIFUL NAME OF HIS OWN THEN
