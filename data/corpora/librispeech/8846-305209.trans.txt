8846-305209-0000 HOW SAINT MONICA LIVED IN THE PAGAN HOUSEHOLD OF HER HUSBAND PATRICIUS ALTHOUGH THERE WERE MANY CHRISTIANS IN ROMAN AFRICA
8846-305209-0001 PAGAN MANNERS AND CUSTOMS STILL SURVIVED IN MANY OF HER CITIES THE PEOPLE CLUNG TO THEIR GAMES IN THE CIRCUS THE CRUEL AND BLOODY COMBATS OF THE ARENA WHICH THOUGH FORBIDDEN BY CONSTANTINE WERE STILL WINKED AT BY PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS
8846-305209-0002 THEY SCARCELY PRETENDED TO BELIEVE IN THEIR RELIGION BUT THEY HELD TO THE OLD PAGAN FESTIVALS
8846-305209-0003 THE PAGANISM OF THE FOURTH CENTURY WITH ITS MOTTO LET US EAT DRINK AND BE MERRY IMPOSED NO SELF DENIAL IT WAS THEREFORE BOUND TO BE POPULAR BUT UNRESTRAINED HUMAN NATURE IS A DANGEROUS THING
8846-305209-0004 IF MEN ARE CONTENT TO LIVE AS THE BEASTS THAT PERISH THEY FALL AS FAR BELOW THEIR LEVEL AS GOD MEANT THEM TO RISE ABOVE IT AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS FALLING TO PIECES THROUGH ITS OWN CORRUPTION IN AFRICA THE WORSHIP OF THE OLD PUNIC GODS
8846-305209-0005 TO WHOM LIVING CHILDREN USED TO BE OFFERED IN SACRIFICE HAD STILL ITS VOTARIES
8846-305209-0006 IT WAS HARD FOR THE CHRISTIAN BISHOPS TO KEEP THEIR FLOCKS UNTAINTED FOR THERE WERE ENEMIES ON EVERY SIDE
8846-305209-0007 PATRICIUS HE HELD A GOOD POSITION IN THE TOWN FOR HE BELONGED TO A FAMILY WHICH THOUGH POOR WAS NOBLE
8846-305209-0008 MONICA KNEW LITTLE OF HER FUTURE HUSBAND SAVE THAT HE WAS NEARLY TWICE HER AGE AND A PAGAN BUT IT WAS THE CUSTOM FOR PARENTS TO ARRANGE ALL SUCH MATTERS AND SHE HAD ONLY TO OBEY
8846-305209-0009 THAT THINGS MIGHT GO HARD WITH THEIR DAUGHTER IN THE MEANTIME THEY DID NOT SEEM TO FORESEE MONICA TOOK HER NEW TROUBLE WHERE SHE HAD BEEN USED TO TAKE THE OLD
8846-305209-0010 KNEELING IN HER FAVOURITE CORNER IN THE CHURCH SHE ASKED HELP AND COUNSEL OF THE FRIEND WHO NEVER FAILS SHE HAD HAD HER GIRLISH IDEALS OF LOVE AND MARRIAGE SHE HAD DREAMT OF A STRONG ARM ON WHICH SHE COULD LEAN
8846-305209-0011 OF A HEART AND SOUL THAT WOULD BE AT ONE WITH HER IN ALL THAT WAS MOST DEAR OF TWO LIVES SPENT TOGETHER IN GOD'S LOVE AND SERVICE AND NOW IT SEEMED THAT IT WAS SHE WHO WOULD HAVE TO BE STRONG FOR BOTH
8846-305209-0012 TO STRIVE AND TO SUFFER TO BRING HER HUSBAND'S SOUL OUT OF DARKNESS
8846-305209-0013 WOULD SHE SUCCEED AND IF NOT WHAT WOULD BE THAT MARRIED LIFE WHICH LAY BEFORE HER SHE DID NOT DARE TO THINK SHE MUST NOT FAIL AND YET THOU IN ME O LORD SHE PRAYED AGAIN
8846-305209-0014 AND AGAIN THROUGH HER TEARS
8846-305209-0015 SHE LAID THE IDEALS OF HER GIRLHOOD AT THE FEET OF HIM WHO LETS NO SACRIFICE HOWEVER SMALL GO UNREWARDED SHE WOULD BE TRUE TO THIS NEW TRUST SHE RESOLVED COST WHAT IT MIGHT
8846-305209-0016 THINGS CERTAINLY DID NOT PROMISE WELL FOR THE YOUNG BRIDE'S HAPPINESS PATRICIUS LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER A WOMAN OF STRONG PASSIONS LIKE HIMSELF AND DEVOTED TO HER SON SHE WAS BITTERLY JEALOUS OF THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD STOLEN HIS AFFECTIONS
8846-305209-0017 AND HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO DISLIKE HER THE SLAVES OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOLLOWED OF COURSE THEIR MISTRESS'S LEAD AND TRIED TO PLEASE HER BY INVENTING STORIES AGAINST MONICA
8846-305209-0018 PATRICIUS WHO LOVED HIS YOUNG WIFE WITH THE ONLY KIND OF LOVE OF WHICH HE WAS CAPABLE HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH HER AND HAD NO CLUE TO HER THOUGHTS OR ACTIONS HE HAD NEITHER REVERENCE NOR RESPECT FOR WOMEN
8846-305209-0019 INDEED MOST OF THE WOMEN OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE WERE DESERVING OF NEITHER AND HE HAD CHOSEN MONICA FOR HER BEAUTY MUCH AS HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN A HORSE OR A DOG HE THOUGHT HER WAYS AND IDEAS EXTRAORDINARY
8846-305209-0020 SHE TOOK AS KINDLY AN INTEREST IN THE SLAVES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN OF HER OWN FLESH AND BLOOD AND WOULD EVEN INTERCEDE TO SPARE THEM A BEATING SHE LIKED THE POOR AND WOULD GATHER THESE DIRTY AND UNPLEASANT PEOPLE ABOUT HER
8846-305209-0021 GOING SO FAR EVEN AS TO WASH AND DRESS THEIR SORES PATRICIUS DID NOT SHARE HER ATTRACTION AND OBJECTED STRONGLY TO SUCH PROCEEDINGS BUT MONICA PLEADED SO HUMBLY AND SWEETLY THAT HE GAVE WAY
8846-305209-0022 AND LET HER DO WHAT SEEMED TO CAUSE HER SO MUCH PLEASURE THERE WAS NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTES HE REMARKED SHE WOULD SPEND HOURS IN THE CHURCH PRAYING WITH HER GREAT EYES FIXED ON THE ALTAR TRUE SHE WAS NEVER THERE AT ANY TIME WHEN SHE WAS LIKELY TO BE MISSED BY HER HUSBAND
8846-305209-0023 THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT MONICA IT IS TRUE THAT WAS ALTOGETHER UNLIKE ANY OTHER INMATE OF THE HOUSE AS SHE WENT ABOUT HER DAILY DUTIES ALWAYS WATCHING FOR THE CHANCE OF DOING A KIND ACTION WHEN PATRICIUS WAS IN ONE OF HIS VIOLENT TEMPERS
8846-305209-0024 SHOUTING ABUSING AND EVEN STRIKING EVERYBODY WHO CAME IN HIS WAY SHE WOULD LOOK AT HIM WITH GENTLE EYES THAT SHOWED NEITHER FEAR NOR ANGER SHE NEVER ANSWERED SHARPLY EVEN THOUGH HIS RUDE WORDS WOUNDED HER CRUELLY
8846-305209-0025 HE HAD ONCE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE HER BUT HE HAD NOT DARED SOMETHING HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WITHHELD HIM LATER WHEN HIS ANGER HAD SUBSIDED AND HE WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HIS VIOLENCE
8846-305209-0026 SHE WOULD MEET HIM WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SMILE FORGIVING AND FORGETTING ALL ONLY IF HE SPOKE HIMSELF AND TOUCHED AT HER GENEROUS FORBEARANCE TRIED SHAMEFACEDLY TO MAKE AMENDS FOR HIS TREATMENT OF HER WOULD SHE GENTLY EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT
8846-305209-0027 MORE OFTEN SHE SAID NOTHING KNOWING THAT ACTIONS SPEAK MORE LOUDLY THAN WORDS AS HER GREATEST BIOGRAPHER SAYS OF HER SHE SPOKE LITTLE PREACHED NOT AT ALL
8846-305209-0028 LOVED MUCH AND PRAYED UNCEASINGLY WHEN THE YOUNG WIVES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE MARRIED LIKE HERSELF TO PAGAN HUSBANDS COMPLAINED OF THE INSULTS AND EVEN BLOWS WHICH THEY HAD TO BEAR
8846-305209-0029 ARE YOU SURE YOUR OWN TONGUE IS NOT TO BLAME SHE WOULD ASK THEM LAUGHINGLY AND THEN WITH READY SYMPATHY WOULD DO ALL SHE COULD TO HELP AND COMFORT AND ADVISE THEY WOULD ASK HER SECRET FOR EVERYONE KNEW THAT IN SPITE OF THE VIOLENCE OF PATRICIUS'S TEMPER
8846-305209-0030 HE TREATED HER WITH SOMETHING THAT ALMOST APPROACHED RESPECT THEN SHE WOULD BID THEM BE PATIENT AND LOVE AND PRAY AND MEET HARSHNESS WITH GENTLENESS AND ABUSE WITH SILENCE
8846-305209-0031 AND WHEN THEY SOMETIMES ANSWERED THAT IT WOULD SEEM WEAK TO KNOCK UNDER IN SUCH A FASHION MONICA WOULD ASK THEM IF THEY THOUGHT IT NEEDED MORE STRENGTH TO SPEAK OR TO BE SILENT WHEN PROVOKED AND WHICH WAS EASIER TO SMILE
8846-305209-0032 OR TO SULK WHEN INSULTED MANY HOMES WERE HAPPIER IN CONSEQUENCE FOR MONICA HAD A PARTICULAR GIFT FOR MAKING PEACE AND EVEN AS A CHILD HAD SETTLED THE QUARRELS OF HER YOUNG COMPANIONS TO EVERYBODY'S SATISFACTION
8846-305209-0033 TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD PATRICIUS'S YOUNG WIFE SEEMED CONTENTED AND HAPPY SHE MANAGED HER AFFAIRS WELL PEOPLE SAID AND NO ONE BUT GOD KNEW OF THE SUFFERING THAT WAS HER SECRET AND HIS BROUGHT UP IN THE PEACE AND PIETY OF A CHRISTIAN FAMILY
8846-305209-0034 SHE HAD HAD NO IDEA OF THE MISERIES OF PAGANISM NOW SHE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF UNCHECKED SELFISHNESS AND OF UNCONTROLLED PASSIONS TO SEE HOW LOW HUMAN NATURE
8846-305209-0035 UNRESTRAINED BY FAITH AND LOVE COULD FALL HER MOTHER IN LAW TREATED HER WITH SUSPICION AND DISLIKE FOR THE SLAVES NEVER WEARY OF INVENTING FRESH STORIES AGAINST HER MISREPRESENTED ALL HER ACTIONS TO THEIR MISTRESS
8846-305209-0036 MONICA DID NOT SEEM TO NOTICE UNKINDNESS REPAYING THE MANY INSULTS SHE RECEIVED WITH LITTLE SERVICES TACTFULLY RENDERED BUT SHE FELT IT DEEPLY THEY DO NOT KNOW SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF
8846-305209-0037 AND PRAY FOR THEM ALL THE MORE EARNESTLY OFFERING HER SUFFERINGS FOR THESE POOR SOULS WHO WERE SO FAR FROM THE PEACE OF CHRIST HOW WAS THE LIGHT TO COME TO THEM IF NOT THROUGH HER HOW COULD THEY LEARN TO LOVE CHRIST UNLESS THEY LEARNED TO LOVE HIS SERVANTS
8846-305209-0038 AND TO SEE HIM IN THEM THE REVELATION MUST COME THROUGH HER IF IT WAS TO COME AT ALL THOU IN ME O LORD SHE WOULD PRAY AND DRAW STRENGTH AND COURAGE AT HIS FEET FOR THE DAILY SUFFERING
8846-305209-0039 THE HEART OF PATRICIUS WAS LIKE A NEGLECTED GARDEN GERMS OF GENEROSITY OF NOBILITY LAY HIDDEN UNDER A RANK GROWTH OF WEEDS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER BEEN AT ANY TROUBLE TO CLEAR AWAY THE HABITS OF A LIFETIME HELD HIM CAPTIVE
8846-305209-0040 THE WHOLE TOWN BEGAN TO TALK OF HIS NEGLECT OF HIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIFE MONICA SUFFERED CRUELLY BUT IN SILENCE WHEN HE WAS AT HOME WHICH WAS BUT SELDOM SHE WAS SERENE AND GENTLE AS USUAL
8846-305209-0041 SHE NEVER REPROACHED HIM AND TREATED HIM WITH THE SAME TENDER DEFERENCE AS OF OLD PATRICIUS FELT THE CHARM OF HER PRESENCE ALL THAT WAS GOOD IN HIM RESPONDED BUT EVIL HABITS HAD GONE FAR TO STIFLE THE GOOD
8846-305209-0042 AND HIS LOWER NATURE CRIED OUT FOR BASE ENJOYMENTS HE WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN WHICH HELD HIM SO MONICA WEPT AND PRAYED IN SECRET AND GOD SENT A RAY OF SUNSHINE TO BRIGHTEN HER SAD LIFE
8846-305209-0043 THREE CHILDREN WERE BORN TO HER DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF HER MARRIAGE THE NAME OF AUGUSTINE HER ELDEST SON WILL BE FOR EVER ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF HIS MOTHER OF THE OTHER TWO NAVIGIUS AND PERPETUA HIS SISTER WE KNOW LITTLE
8846-305209-0044 NAVIGIUS DELICATE IN HEALTH WAS OF A GENTLE AND PIOUS NATURE BOTH HE AND PERPETUA MARRIED BUT THE LATTER AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DEATH ENTERED A MONASTERY
