949-138545-0000 THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION CONSIDERED FROM ONE SIDE COLONIZATION WHATEVER THE MOTIVES OF THE EMIGRANTS WAS AN ECONOMIC MATTER IT INVOLVED THE USE OF CAPITAL TO PAY FOR THEIR PASSAGE TO SUSTAIN THEM ON THE VOYAGE AND TO START THEM ON THE WAY OF PRODUCTION
949-138545-0001 UNDER THIS STERN ECONOMIC NECESSITY PURITANS SCOTCH IRISH GERMANS AND ALL WERE ALIKE LAID IMMIGRANTS WHO PAID THEIR OWN WAY
949-138545-0002 UNDOUBTEDLY A VERY CONSIDERABLE NUMBER COULD DO SO FOR WE CAN TRACE THE FAMILY FORTUNES OF MANY EARLY SETTLERS HENRY CABOT LODGE IS AUTHORITY FOR THE STATEMENT THAT THE SETTLERS OF NEW ENGLAND WERE DRAWN
949-138545-0003 THEY DID NOT BELONG TO THE CLASSES FROM WHICH EMIGRATION IS USUALLY SUPPLIED FOR THEY ALL HAD A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY THEY LEFT BEHIND THOUGH IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW HOW ACCURATE THIS STATEMENT IS OR HOW APPLICABLE TO THE OTHER COLONIES
949-138545-0004 NO STUDY HAS AS YET BEEN MADE TO GRATIFY THAT INTEREST FOR THE PRESENT IT IS AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM JUST HOW MANY OF THE COLONISTS WERE ABLE TO BEAR THE COST OF THEIR OWN TRANSFER TO THE NEW WORLD INDENTURED SERVANTS THAT
949-138545-0005 TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY A PLAN WAS WORKED OUT WHEREBY SHIPOWNERS AND OTHER PERSONS OF MEANS FURNISHED THE PASSAGE MONEY TO IMMIGRANTS IN RETURN FOR THEIR PROMISE OR BOND TO WORK FOR A TERM OF YEARS TO REPAY THE SUM ADVANCED
949-138545-0006 THIS SYSTEM WAS CALLED INDENTURED SERVITUDE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE NUMBER OF BOND SERVANTS EXCEEDED THE ORIGINAL TWENTY THOUSAND PURITANS THE YEOMEN THE VIRGINIA GENTLEMEN AND THE HUGUENOTS COMBINED
949-138545-0007 ALL THE WAY DOWN THE COAST FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO GEORGIA WERE TO BE FOUND IN THE FIELDS KITCHENS AND WORKSHOPS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SERVING OUT TERMS OF BONDAGE GENERALLY RANGING FROM FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS
949-138545-0008 IN THE PROPRIETARY COLONIES THE PROPORTION OF BOND SERVANTS WAS VERY HIGH THE BALTIMORES PENNS CARTERETS AND OTHER PROMOTERS ANXIOUSLY SOUGHT FOR WORKERS OF EVERY NATIONALITY TO TILL THEIR FIELDS FOR LAND WITHOUT LABOR WAS WORTH NO MORE THAN LAND IN THE MOON
949-138545-0009 HENCE THE GATES OF THE PROPRIETARY COLONIES WERE FLUNG WIDE OPEN EVERY INDUCEMENT WAS OFFERED TO IMMIGRANTS IN THE FORM OF CHEAP LAND AND SPECIAL EFFORTS WERE MADE TO INCREASE THE POPULATION BY IMPORTING SERVANTS
949-138545-0010 THE STORY OF THIS TRAFFIC IN WHITE SERVANTS IS ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING THINGS IN THE HISTORY OF LABOR BONDMEN DIFFERED FROM THE SERFS OF THE FEUDAL AGE IN THAT THEY WERE NOT BOUND TO THE SOIL BUT TO THE MASTER THEY LIKEWISE DIFFERED FROM THE NEGRO SLAVES
949-138545-0011 IN THAT THEIR SERVITUDE HAD A TIME LIMIT STILL THEY WERE SUBJECT TO MANY SPECIAL DISABILITIES IT WAS FOR INSTANCE A COMMON PRACTICE TO IMPOSE ON THEM PENALTIES FAR HEAVIER THAN WERE IMPOSED UPON FREEMEN FOR THE SAME OFFENSE
949-138545-0012 A FREE CITIZEN OF PENNSYLVANIA WHO INDULGED IN HORSE RACING AND GAMBLING WAS LET OFF WITH A FINE A WHITE SERVANT GUILTY OF THE SAME UNLAWFUL CONDUCT WAS WHIPPED AT THE POST AND FINED AS WELL
949-138545-0013 THE CONDITION OF WHITE BONDMEN IN VIRGINIA ACCORDING TO LODGE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT OF SLAVES LOOSE INDENTURES AND HARSH LAWS PUT THEM AT THE MERCY OF THEIR MASTERS
949-138545-0014 THAT SUCH WAS THEIR LOT IN ALL OTHER COLONIES THEIR FATE DEPENDED UPON THE TEMPER OF THEIR MASTERS CRUEL
949-138545-0015 A CHANCE TO REACH THE NEW AN OPPORTUNITY TO WRESTLE WITH FATE FOR FREEDOM AND A HOME OF THEIR OWN WHEN THEIR WEARY YEARS OF SERVITUDE WERE OVER IF THEY SURVIVED THEY MIGHT OBTAIN LAND OF THEIR OWN OR SETTLE AS FREE MECHANICS IN THE TOWNS
949-138545-0016 FOR MANY A BONDMAN THE GAMBLE PROVED TO BE A LOSING VENTURE BECAUSE HE FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO RISE OUT OF THE STATE OF POVERTY AND DEPENDENCE INTO WHICH HIS SERVITUDE CARRIED HIM FOR THOUSANDS ON THE CONTRARY BONDAGE PROVED TO BE A REAL AVENUE TO FREEDOM AND PROSPERITY
949-138545-0017 SOME OF THE BEST CITIZENS OF AMERICA HAVE THE BLOOD OF INDENTURED SERVANTS IN THEIR VEINS THE TRANSPORTED INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE
949-138545-0018 IN THEIR ANXIETY TO SECURE SETTLERS THE COMPANIES AND PROPRIETORS HAVING COLONIES IN AMERICA EITHER RESORTED TO OR CONNIVED AT THE PRACTICE OF KIDNAPPING MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM THE STREETS OF ENGLISH CITIES
949-138545-0019 IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY IT WAS OFFICIALLY ESTIMATED THAT TEN THOUSAND PERSONS WERE SPIRITED AWAY TO AMERICA MANY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE PRACTICE WERE YOUNG CHILDREN FOR THE TRAFFIC IN THEM WAS HIGHLY PROFITABLE
949-138545-0020 ORPHANS AND DEPENDENTS WERE SOMETIMES DISPOSED OF IN AMERICA BY RELATIVES UNWILLING TO SUPPORT THEM IN A SINGLE YEAR
949-138545-0021 IN THIS GRUESOME BUSINESS THERE LURKED MANY TRAGEDIES AND VERY FEW ROMANCES PARENTS WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND HUSBANDS FROM THEIR WIVES HUNDREDS OF SKILLED ARTISANS CARPENTERS SMITHS AND WEAVERS
949-138545-0022 UTTERLY DISAPPEARED AS IF SWALLOWED UP BY DEATH A FEW THUS DRAGGED OFF TO THE NEW WORLD
949-138545-0023 AKIN TO THE KIDNAPPED AT LEAST IN ECONOMIC POSITION WERE CONVICTS DEPORTED TO THE COLONIES FOR LIFE IN LIEU OF FINES AND IMPRISONMENT THE AMERICANS PROTESTED VIGOROUSLY BUT INEFFECTUALLY AGAINST THIS PRACTICE
949-138545-0024 INDEED THEY EXAGGERATED ITS EVILS FOR MANY OF THE CRIMINALS WERE ONLY MILD OFFENDERS AGAINST UNDULY HARSH AND CRUEL LAWS A PEASANT CAUGHT SHOOTING A RABBIT ON A LORD'S ESTATE
949-138545-0025 OR A LUCKLESS SERVANT GIRL WHO PURLOINED A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF WAS BRANDED AS A CRIMINAL ALONG WITH STURDY THIEVES AND INCORRIGIBLE RASCALS OTHER TRANSPORTED OFFENDERS WERE POLITICAL CRIMINALS THAT IS PERSONS WHO CRITICIZED OR OPPOSED THE GOVERNMENT
949-138545-0026 AND SCOTCH AND ENGLISH SUBJECTS IN GENERAL WHO JOINED IN POLITICAL UPRISINGS AGAINST THE KING THE AFRICAN SLAVES RIVALING IN NUMBERS IN THE COURSE OF TIME THE INDENTURED SERVANTS AND WHITES CARRIED TO AMERICA AGAINST THEIR WILL WERE THE AFRICAN NEGROES
949-138545-0027 BROUGHT TO AMERICA AND SOLD INTO SLAVERY WHEN THIS FORM OF BONDAGE WAS FIRST INTRODUCED INTO VIRGINIA IN SIXTEEN NINETEEN IT WAS LOOKED UPON AS A TEMPORARY NECESSITY TO BE DISCARDED WITH THE INCREASE OF THE WHITE POPULATION MOREOVER IT DOES NOT APPEAR
949-138545-0028 THAT THOSE PLANTERS WHO FIRST BOUGHT NEGROES AT THE AUCTION BLOCK INTENDED TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF PERMANENT BONDAGE ONLY BY A SLOW PROCESS DID CHATTEL SLAVERY TAKE FIRM ROOT AND BECOME RECOGNIZED AS THE LEADING SOURCE OF THE LABOR SUPPLY IN SIXTEEN FIFTY
949-138545-0029 THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF SLAVERY THERE WERE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AFRICANS IN VIRGINIA THE GREAT INCREASE IN LATER YEARS WAS DUE IN NO SMALL MEASURE TO THE INORDINATE ZEAL FOR PROFITS THAT SEIZED SLAVE TRADERS BOTH IN OLD AND IN NEW ENGLAND
949-138545-0030 FINDING IT RELATIVELY EASY TO SECURE NEGROES IN AFRICA THEY CROWDED THE SOUTHERN PORTS WITH THEIR VESSELS THE ENGLISH ROYAL AFRICAN COMPANY SENT TO AMERICA ANNUALLY BETWEEN SEVENTEEN THIRTEEN AND SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE FROM FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND SLAVES
949-138545-0031 THE SHIP OWNERS OF NEW ENGLAND WERE NOT FAR BEHIND THEIR ENGLISH BRETHREN IN PUSHING THIS EXTRAORDINARY TRAFFIC AS THE PROPORTION OF THE NEGROES TO THE FREE WHITE POPULATION STEADILY ROSE AND AS WHOLE SECTIONS WERE OVERRUN WITH SLAVES AND SLAVE TRADERS THE SOUTHERN COLONIES GREW ALARMED
949-138545-0032 THIS EFFORT WAS FUTILE FOR THE ROYAL GOVERNOR PROMPTLY VETOED IT FROM TIME TO TIME SIMILAR BILLS WERE PASSED ONLY TO MEET WITH ROYAL DISAPPROVAL SOUTH CAROLINA IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED IMPORTATION BUT THE MEASURE WAS KILLED BY THE BRITISH CROWN
949-138545-0033 AS LATE AS SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO VIRGINIA NOT DAUNTED BY A CENTURY OF REBUFFS SENT TO GEORGE THE THIRD A PETITION IN THIS VEIN THE IMPORTATION OF SLAVES INTO THE COLONIES FROM THE COAST OF AFRICA
949-138545-0034 DEEPLY IMPRESSED WITH THESE SENTIMENTS WE MOST HUMBLY BESEECH YOUR MAJESTY TO REMOVE ALL THOSE RESTRAINTS ON YOUR MAJESTY'S GOVERNORS OF THIS COLONY WHICH INHIBIT THEIR ASSENTING TO SUCH LAWS AS MIGHT CHECK SO VERY PERNICIOUS A COMMERCE
949-138545-0035 ALL SUCH PROTESTS WERE WITHOUT AVAIL THE NEGRO POPULATION GREW BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS UNTIL ON THE EVE OF THE REVOLUTION IT AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN HALF A MILLION IN FIVE STATES MARYLAND VIRGINIA THE TWO CAROLINAS AND GEORGIA
949-138545-0036 THE SLAVES NEARLY EQUALLED OR ACTUALLY EXCEEDED THE WHITES IN NUMBER IN SOUTH CAROLINA THEY FORMED ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE POPULATION EVEN IN THE MIDDLE COLONIES OF DELAWARE AND PENNSYLVANIA ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF THE INHABITANTS WERE FROM AFRICA TO THE NORTH THE PROPORTION OF SLAVES STEADILY DIMINISHED
949-138545-0037 INCLUDING A FEW FREEDMEN THE CLIMATE THE SOIL THE COMMERCE AND THE INDUSTRY OF THE NORTH WERE ALL UNFAVORABLE TO THE GROWTH OF A SERVILE POPULATION STILL SLAVERY THOUGH SECTIONAL WAS A PART OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF ECONOMY
949-138545-0038 NORTHERN SHIPS CARRIED SLAVES TO THE SOUTHERN COLONIES AND THE PRODUCE OF THE PLANTATIONS TO EUROPE IF THE NORTHERN STATES WILL CONSULT THEIR INTEREST THEY WILL NOT OPPOSE THE INCREASE IN SLAVES WHICH WILL INCREASE THE COMMODITIES
949-138545-0039 OF WHICH THEY WILL BECOME THE CARRIERS SAID JOHN RUTLEDGE OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE CONVENTION WHICH FRAMED THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
