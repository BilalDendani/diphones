4824-36029-0001 THE SERVANT WHO HAD STOOD WAITING FOR A DEFINITE COMMAND DURING THIS BRIEF CONFLICT OF WILLS GLANCED INTERROGATIVELY AT MISSUS ORGREAVE AND PERCEIVING NO CLEAR PROHIBITION IN HER FACE DEPARTED WITH A SMILE TO GET THE WINE
4824-36029-0002 SHE WAS A SERVANT OF SOUND PRESTIGE AND HAD THE INEXPRESSIBLE PRIVILEGE OF SMILING ON DUTY IN HER TIME SHE HAD FOUGHT LIVELY BATTLES OF REPARTEE WITH ALL THE CHILDREN FROM CHARLIE DOWNWARDS
4824-36029-0003 JANET HUMOURED MARTHA AND MARTHA HUMOURED MISSUS ORGREAVE THE WHOLE FAMILY SAVE ABSENT MARIAN WAS NOW GATHERED IN THE DINING ROOM ANOTHER APARTMENT ON WHOSE PHYSIOGNOMY WERE WRITTEN IN CIPHER
4824-36029-0004 THE ANNALS OF THE VIVACIOUS TRIBE HERE THE CURTAINS WERE DRAWN AND ALL THE INTEREST OF THE ROOM CENTRED ON THE LARGE WHITE GLEAMING TABLE ABOUT WHICH THE MEMBERS STOOD OR SAT UNDER THE DOWNWARD RADIANCE OF A CHANDELIER
4824-36029-0005 BEYOND THE CIRCLE ILLUMINATED BY THE SHADED CHANDELIER COULD BE DISCERNED DIM FORMS OF FURNITURE AND OF PICTURES WITH A GLINT OF HIGH LIGHT HERE AND THERE BURNING ON THE CORNER OF SOME GOLD FRAME
4824-36029-0006 TOM SAT NEAR HIS MOTHER JANET AND HILDA SAT TOGETHER FLANKED BY JIMMIE AND JOHNNIE WHO STOOD HAVING PUSHED CHAIRS AWAY CHARLIE AND EDWIN STOOD OPPOSITE THE TABLE SEEMED TO EDWIN TO BE HEAPED WITH FOOD

4824-36029-0008 A LARGE GLASS JUG OF LEMONADE SHONE NEAR BY PLATES GLASSES AND CUTLERY WERE STREWN ABOUT IRREGULARLY THE EFFECT UPON EDWIN WAS ONE OF IMMENSE AND CARELESS PRODIGALITY IT INTOXICATED HIM
4824-36029-0009 IT MADE HIM FEEL THAT A GRAND PROFUSENESS WAS THE FINEST THING IN LIFE IN HIS OWN HOME THE SUPPER CONSISTED OF CHEESE BREAD AND WATER SAVE ON SUNDAYS WHEN COLD SAUSAGES WERE GENERALLY ADDED TO MAKE A FEAST
4824-36029-0010 BUT THE IDEA OF THE PRICE OF LIVING AS THE ORGREAVES LIVED SERIOUSLY STARTLED THE PRUDENCE IN HIM IMAGINE THAT EXPENSE ALWAYS PERSISTING DAY AFTER DAY NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
4824-36029-0011 THERE WERE CERTAINLY AT LEAST FOUR IN THE FAMILY WHO BOUGHT CLOTHES AT SHILLITOE'S AND EVERYBODY LOOKED ELABORATELY COSTLY EXCEPT HILDA LESSWAYS WHO DID NOT FLATTER THE EYE
4824-36029-0012 BUT EQUALLY THEY ALL SEEMED QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF THEIR COSTLINESS NOW CHARLIE DARLING YOU MUST LOOK AFTER MISTER EDWIN SAID MISSUS ORGREAVE
4824-36029-0013 SIT DOWN CHARLIE INSISTED USING FORCE
4824-36029-0014 HERE I COME DOWN SPECIALLY TO SEE THEM CHARLIE MUSED ALOUD AS HE TWISTED THE CORKSCREW INTO THE CORK OF THE BOTTLE UNCEREMONIOUSLY HANDED TO HIM BY MARTHA AND NOT ONLY THEY DON'T OFFER TO PAY MY FARES BUT THEY GRUDGE ME A DROP OF CLARET
4824-36029-0015 PLUPP HE GRIMACED AS THE CORK CAME OUT AND MY LAST NIGHT TOO HILDA THIS IS BETTER THAN COFFEE AS SAINT PAUL REMARKED ON A FAMOUS OCCASION PASS YOUR GLASS CHARLIE HIS MOTHER PROTESTED I'LL THANK YOU TO LEAVE SAINT PAUL OUT
4824-36029-0016 CHARLIE YOUR MOTHER WILL BE BOXING YOUR EARS IF YOU DON'T MIND HIS FATHER WARNED HIM I'LL NOT HAVE IT SAID HIS MOTHER SHAKING HER HEAD IN A FASHION THAT SHE IMAGINED TO BE HARSH AND FORBIDDING
4824-36029-0017 TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE MEAL MISTER ORGREAVE SAID WELL EDWIN WHAT DOES YOUR FATHER SAY ABOUT BRADLAUGH HE DOESN'T SAY MUCH EDWIN REPLIED LET ME SEE DOES HE CALL HIMSELF A LIBERAL
4824-36029-0018 HE CALLS HIMSELF A LIBERAL SAID EDWIN SHIFTING ON HIS CHAIR YES HE CALLS HIMSELF A LIBERAL BUT I'M AFRAID HE'S A REGULAR OLD TORY EDWIN BLUSHED LAUGHING AS HALF THE FAMILY GAVE WAY TO MORE OR LESS VIOLENT MIRTH
4824-36029-0019 FATHER'S A REGULAR OLD TORY TOO CHARLIE GRINNED OH I'M SORRY SAID EDWIN YES FATHER'S A REGULAR OLD TORY AGREED MISTER ORGREAVE DON'T APOLOGISE DON'T APOLOGISE I'M USED TO THESE ATTACKS I'VE BEEN NEARLY KICKED OUT OF MY OWN HOUSE ONCE
4824-36029-0020 BUT SOME ONE HAS TO KEEP THE FLAG FLYING IT WAS PLAIN THAT MISTER ORGREAVE ENJOYED THE UNLOOSING OF THE HURRICANE WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT ABOUT MISSUS ORGREAVE USED TO SAY THAT HE EMPLOYED THAT PARTICULAR TONE FROM A NAUGHTY LOVE OF MISCHIEF
4824-36029-0021 IN A MOMENT ALL THE BOYS WERE UPON HIM EXCEPT JIMMIE WHO OUT OF SHEER INTELLECTUAL SNOBBERY AS THE REST AVERRED SUPPORTED HIS FATHER ATHEISTICAL BRADLAUGH HAD BEEN EXCITING THE BRITISH PUBLIC TO DISPUTATION FOR A LONG TIME
4824-36029-0022 IN THAT VERY WEEK THE NORTHAMPTON MEMBER HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO CUSTODY FOR OUTRAGING PARLIAMENT AND RELEASED AND IT WAS KNOWN THAT GLADSTONE MEANT IMMEDIATELY TO BRING IN A RESOLUTION FOR PERMITTING MEMBERS TO AFFIRM INSTEAD OF TAKING OATH BY APPEALING TO A GOD
4824-36029-0023 THAN THIS COMPLICATION OF THEOLOGY AND POLITICS NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DEVISED TO IMPASSION AN ELECTORATE WHICH HAD BUT TWO GENUINE INTERESTS THEOLOGY AND POLITICS THE RUMOUR OF THE FEVERISH AFFAIR
4824-36029-0024 HAD SPREAD TO THE MOST ISOLATED COMMUNITIES PEOPLE TALKED THEOLOGY AND PEOPLE TALKED POLITICS WHO HAD TILL THEN ONLY FELT SILENTLY ON THESE SUBJECTS IN LOQUACIOUS FAMILIES BRADLAUGH CAUSED DISSENSION AND DIVISION
4824-36029-0025 MORE REAL PERHAPS THAN APPARENT FOR NOT ALL BRADLAUGH'S SUPPORTERS HAD THE COURAGE TO AVOW THEMSELVES SUCH IT WAS NOT EASY AT ANY RATE IT WAS NOT EASY IN THE FIVE TOWNS FOR A TIMID MAN IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION
4824-36029-0026 THIS WAS WHAT ASTONISHED EDWIN THE CANDOUR WITH WHICH BRADLAUGH'S POSITION WAS UPHELD IN THE DINING ROOM OF THE ORGREAVES IT WAS AS IF HE WERE WITNESSING DEEDS OF WILFUL PERILOUS DARING
4824-36029-0027 BUT THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT CONFINED TO BRADLAUGH FOR BRADLAUGH WAS NOT A PERFECT TEST FOR SEPARATING LIBERALS AND TORIES NOBODY IN THE ROOM FOR EXAMPLE WAS QUITE CONVINCED THAT MISTER ORGREAVE WAS ANTI BRADLAUGH
4824-36029-0028 THE BOYS HAD TO INCLUDE OTHER TOPICS SUCH AS IRELAND AND THE PROPOSAL FOR HOME RULE AS FOR MISTER ORGREAVE HE COULD AND DID ALWAYS INFURIATE THEM BY REFUSING TO ANSWER SERIOUSLY
4824-36029-0029 THE FACT WAS THAT THIS WAS HIS DEVICE FOR MAINTAINING HIS PRESTIGE AMONG THE TURBULENT MOB DIGNIFIED AND BRILLIANTLY CLEVER AS OSMOND ORGREAVE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING IN THE TOWN HE WAS SOMEHOW OUTSHONE IN CLEVERNESS AT HOME
4824-36029-0030 AND HE NEVER PUT THE BAR OF HIS DIGNITY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS CHILDREN THUS HE COULD ONLY KEEP THE UPPER HAND BY ALLOWING HINTS TO ESCAPE FROM HIM OF THE SECRET AMUSEMENT ROUSED IN HIM BY THE COMICALITY
4824-36029-0031 OF THE SPECTACLE OF HIS FILIAL ENEMIES HE HAD ONE GREAT PHRASE WHICH HE WOULD DRAWL OUT AT THEM WITH THE ACCENTS OF A MAN WHO IS TRYING POLITELY TO HIDE HIS CONTEMPT YOU'LL LEARN BETTER AS YOU GET OLDER
4824-36029-0032 EDWIN WHO SAID LITTLE THOUGHT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHER AND SONS UTTERLY DELIGHTFUL HE HAD NOT CONCEIVED THAT PARENTS AND CHILDREN EVER WERE OR COULD BE ON SUCH TERMS NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY EDWIN MISTER ORGREAVE ASKED
4824-36029-0033 ARE YOU A CHARLIE PASS ME THAT BOTTLE CHARLIE WAS HELPING HIMSELF TO ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE THE FATHER THE TWO ELDER SONS AND EDWIN ALONE HAD DRUNK OF THE WINE EDWIN HAD NEVER TASTED WINE IN HIS LIFE
4824-36029-0034 AND THE EFFECT OF HALF A GLASS ON HIM WAS VERY AGREEABLE AND STRANGE OH DAD I JUST WANT A CHARLIE OBJECTED HOLDING THE BOTTLE IN THE AIR ABOVE HIS GLASS
4824-36029-0035 PASS ME THAT BOTTLE MISTER ORGREAVE REPEATED CHARLIE OBEYED PROCLAIMING HIMSELF A MARTYR MISTER ORGREAVE FILLED HIS OWN GLASS EMPTYING THE BOTTLE AND BEGAN TO SIP THIS WILL DO ME MORE GOOD THAN YOU YOUNG MAN HE SAID
4824-36029-0036 THEN TURNING AGAIN TO EDWIN ARE YOU A BRADLAUGH MAN AND EDWIN UPLIFTED SAID ALL I SAY IS YOU CAN'T HELP WHAT YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN'T MAKE YOURSELF BELIEVE ANYTHING AND I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULD EITHER THERE'S NO VIRTUE IN BELIEVING
4824-36029-0037 HOORAY CRIED THE SEDATE TOM
4824-36029-0038 THIS SAD EXPOSTULATION CAME FROM MISSUS ORGREAVE DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN HE PERSISTED VIVACIOUSLY REDDENING BUT HE COULD NOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FURTHER HOORAY REPEATED TOM MISSUS ORGREAVE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH GRIEVED GOOD NATURE
4824-36029-0039 YOU MUSTN'T TAKE MOTHER TOO SERIOUSLY SAID JANET SMILING SHE ONLY PUTS ON THAT EXPRESSION TO KEEP WORSE THINGS FROM BEING SAID SHE'S ONLY PRETENDING TO BE UPSET NOTHING COULD UPSET HER REALLY SHE'S PAST BEING UPSET
4824-36029-0040 CONTENT MERELY TO ADVISE THE COMBATANTS UPON THEIR DEMEANOUR SO YOU'RE AGAINST ME TOO EDWIN MISTER ORGREAVE SIGHED WITH MOCK MELANCHOLY
