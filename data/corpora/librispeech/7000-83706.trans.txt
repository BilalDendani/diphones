7000-83706-0000 A SUBSTITUTE THE STORY OF MY LAST CRICKET MATCH CHAPTER ONE
7000-83706-0001 CAPTAIN I HAVE SOME IDEA OF CRICKET NOT MUCH PERHAPS BUT I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME I WAS NOT IN THE VARSITY TEAM NOR NEAR IT BUT I PLAYED IN THE FRESHMAN'S MATCH
7000-83706-0002 AND PROVIDED MYSELF WITH SPECTACLES I WAS NEARLY IN THE SCHOOL TEAM ONCE THAT WAS WHEN I CARRIED MY BAT FOR FORTY FIVE I MUST OWN THAT MY PERFORMANCE WAS A SURPRISE TO EVERYONE
7000-83706-0003 AND TO MYSELF AMONG THE REST BUT AS I NEVER REPEATED IT OR ANYTHING LIKE IT THEY LEFT ME VERY WISELY OUT OF THE ELEVEN THUS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT FROM A CRICKETING POINT OF VIEW I DID NOT
7000-83706-0004 EVEN IN MY BEST DAYS COME UP TO FIRST RATE FORM AND MY BEST DAYS WERE RECKONING FROM LAST SUMMER QUITE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO DURING THOSE FIFTEEN YEARS I DO NOT REMEMBER ONCE HANDLING A BAT
7000-83706-0005 FAR LESS HITTING AT A CRICKET BALL WITH ONE AND YET IN THIS STATE OF UNPREPAREDNESS I HAD THE PRESUMPTION LAST SUMMER TO CAPTAIN A TEAM AND TO LEAD THEM ON WELL NOT TO VICTORY BUT TO DISGRACE
7000-83706-0006 IT'S A FACT THE MATCH WAS STORWELL VERSUS LATCHMERE STORWELL WAS MY TEAM AND AS I DO NOT THINK A MORE REMARKABLE MATCH WAS EVER KNOWN IN THE WHOLE ANNALS OF CRICKETING HISTORY
7000-83706-0007 I HERE VENTURE TO REPORT IT WHEN THEY FIRST ASKED ME TO PLAY I THOUGHT THEY WERE MAD STORWELL ON SEA IS A VILLAGE ON THE SOUTH COAST I BEG PARDON
7000-83706-0008 I BELIEVE IT IS CALLED BY THE INHABITANTS A TOWN IT IS A PRETTY PLACE AND NOT UNKNOWN IN THE LOCALITY IT HAS A SEASON AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING AND IT WAS DURING THE SEASON I WAS THERE
7000-83706-0009 AND ONE DAY A DEPUTATION OF THE INHABITANTS CALLED ON ME AT MY LODGINGS TO ASK IF I WOULD LEAD THE LOCAL CRICKET CLUB TO SAY VICTORY AS I HAVE SAID
7000-83706-0010 MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY WERE MAD EITHER THAT OR ELSE THAT THEY WERE PLAYING IT OFF ON THE UNPROTECTED STRANGER I HINTED SO MUCH TO THE DEPUTATION THE DEPUTATION SMILED
7000-83706-0011 THE CHIEF SPOKESMAN WAS THE LOCAL BARBER HIS NAME WAS SAPSWORTH HE EXPLAINED THAT MISTER WINGRAVE HAD SENT THEM THERE WINGRAVE WAS THE VICAR WE WERE UP
7000-83706-0012 I DECIDED TO CRUSH THE DEPUTATION BEFORE THE THING WENT FARTHER TO SHOW YOU THE SORT OF MAN YOU PROPOSE SHOULD CAPTAIN YOU
7000-83706-0013 BUT THE ADMISSION DID NOT CRUSH THEM QUITE THE OTHER WAY IT OPENED THE FLOODGATES OF THEIR ELOQUENCE THAT'S NOTHING MISTER SAPSWORTH CRIED THERE'S HEDGES HERE WE'VE HAD TO PUT HIM IN
7000-83706-0014 HE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE RULES OF THE GAME AND HE'S JUST TURNED SIXTY ONE I GLANCED AT MISTER HEDGES THUS FRANKLY REFERRED TO HE WAS A SMILING RED FACED BALD HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN WHO
7000-83706-0015 IF NOT CONSIDERABLE IN HEIGHT WAS GREAT IN GIRTH HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TURNED THE SCALE AT SIXTEEN STONE I FELT THAT TO CRICKETERS WHO INTENDED TO PLAY MISTER HEDGES ANY OBJECTIONS WHICH I MIGHT URGE WOULD APPEAR QUITE TRIVIAL
7000-83706-0016 WHEN IS THE MATCH TO BE I ASKED TO MORROW WAS THE STARTLING REPLY I WAS SPEECHLESS THAT I AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS TOTAL ABSTENTION
7000-83706-0017 SHOULD BE ASKED TO CAPTAIN A TEAM THE MEMBERS OF WHICH WERE ENTIRE STRANGERS TO ME AND OF WHOSE INDIVIDUAL STYLES OF PLAY I HAD NOT THE FAINTEST NOTION IN A MATCH AGAINST AN UNKNOWN FOE AT FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS NOTICE
7000-83706-0018 THE END OF IT WAS THAT I AGREED TO PLAY
