4179-20567-0000 JOAN DISOBEYS WHAT HE NEXT KNEW WAS A FIRE OF AGONY THAT WRAPPED HIS WHOLE BODY AND CONSCIOUSNESS FLASHED BACK ON HIM STRONG ARMS LIFTED HIM UP UP ABOVE HIM HE SENSED THE EYES OF HIS TORTURER
4179-20567-0001 DIM IN MOONLIGHT AND HE BEAT HIS CLUBBED LEFT FIST INTO THAT FACE AFTER THAT HE KNEW HE WAS BEING DRAGGED ONTO A SADDLE BUT A WAVE OF PAIN RUSHED UP HIS SIDE AND NUMBED HIS BRAIN THEREAFTER HIS SENSES RETURNED BY FITS AND STARTS
4179-20567-0002 VAGUELY ONCE HE FELT A STEEL CABLE THAT GIRDLED HIS WAIST AND BREAST AND HELD HIM ERECT THOUGH HIS HEAD FLOPPED BACK AND FORTH ONCE HIS EYES OPENED AND ABOVE HIM GLITTERED THE BRIGHT FIELD OF STARS TOWARDS WHICH HE DRIFTED THROUGH SPACE

4179-20567-0006 WHEN HE WOKE AGAIN IT WAS FROM A DREAM OF FLEEING THROUGH EMPTY AIR SWIFTER THAN THE WIND WITH A WOLF DOG LOOMING BEHIND HIM OUT OF SPACE BUT PRESENTLY HE FOUND THAT HE WAS LYING IN A BED
