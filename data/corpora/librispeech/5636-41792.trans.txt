5636-41792-0000 THAT WAS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH ALLAN CAREY'S LITTLE DAUGHTER JULIA AGED THIRTEEN SHE WAS AND ALWAYS HAD BEEN THE PINK OF PERFECTION AS A BABY SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN EXEMPLARY
5636-41792-0001 EATING HEARTILY AND SLEEPING SOUNDLY WHEN SHE FELT A PIN IN HER FLANNEL PETTICOAT SHE DEEMED IT DISCOURTEOUS TO CRY BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT HER NURSE HAD AT LEAST TRIED TO DRESS HER PROPERLY
5636-41792-0002 NOR GO WRONG IT WAS WELL MEANT OF COURSE BUT PROBABLY THE ANGELS WHO HAD THE MATTER IN CHARGE WERE NEW YOUNG INEXPERIENCED ANGELS WITH VAGUE IDEAS OF HUMAN NATURE AND INEXACT KNOWLEDGE OF GOD'S INTENTIONS
5636-41792-0003 BECAUSE A CHILD THAT HAS NO CAPABILITY OF DOING THE WRONG THING WILL HARDLY BE ABLE TO MANAGE A RIGHT ONE NOT ONE OF THE BIG SORT ANYWAY AT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLD JULIA WAS ALWAYS SPOKEN OF AS SUCH A GOOD LITTLE GIRL
5636-41792-0004 MISSUS ALLAN CAREY WAS AS FLIGHTY AND CAPRICIOUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE AND GAY AND NAUGHTY AS JULIA WAS STEADY LIMITED NARROW CONVENTIONAL AND DULL
5636-41792-0005 BUT THE FLIGHTY MOTHER PASSED OUT OF THE CAREY FAMILY LIFE AND JULIA FROM THE AGE OF FIVE ONWARD FELL INTO THE CHARGE OF A PIOUS UNIMAGINATIVE GOVERNESS INSTEAD OF BEING TURNED OUT TO PASTURE WITH A LOT OF FROLICSOME YOUNG HUMAN CREATURES
5636-41792-0006 SO AT THIRTEEN SHE HAD APPARENTLY SETTLED HARD SOLID AND FIRM INTO A MOULD SHE HAD SMOOTH FAIR HAIR PALE BLUE EYES THIN LIPS AND A SOMEWHAT TOO PLUMP SHAPE FOR HER YEARS
5636-41792-0007 SHE WAS ALWAYS TIDY AND WORE HER CLOTHES WELL LAYING ENORMOUS STRESS UPON THEIR MATERIAL AND STYLE THIS TRAIT IN HER CHARACTER HAVING BEEN ADDED UNDER THE FOSTERING INFLUENCE OF THE WEALTHY AND FASHIONABLE
5636-41792-0008 GLADYS FERGUSON AT THIRTEEN WHEN JULIA JOINED THE FLOCK OF CAREY CHICKENS SHE HAD THE AIR OF BELONGING TO QUITE ANOTHER ORDER OF BEINGS THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH A DISCIPLINE SELDOM SUFFERED BY ONLY CHILDREN
5636-41792-0009 THEY HAD HAD TO DIVIDE APPLES AND TOYS
5636-41792-0010 IF NANCY HAD A NEW DRESS AT CHRISTMAS KATHLEEN HAD A NEW HAT IN THE SPRING
5636-41792-0011 AND KATHLEEN'S EARS TOO GREW WELL ACCUSTOMED TO THE SAME PHRASE AFTER PETER WAS BORN JULIA NEVER DID A NAUGHTY THING IN HER LIFE NOR SPOKE A WRONG WORD SAID HER FATHER ONCE PROUDLY
5636-41792-0012 SHE SEEMED TO HAVE NO INSTINCT OF ADAPTING HERSELF TO THE FAMILY LIFE
5636-41792-0013 NO GENEROUS ENTHUSIASMS THAT CARRIED HER TOO FAR FOR SAFETY OR PROPRIETY SHE BROUGHT WITH HER TO BEULAH SHEAVES OF SCHOOL CERTIFICATES AND WHEN SHE SHOWED THEM TO GILBERT WITH THEIR
5636-41792-0014 DEPORTMENT AND NINETY EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS PER CENT SCHOLARSHIP EVERY MONTH FOR YEARS HE WENT OUT BEHIND THE BARN AND KICKED ITS FOUNDATIONS SAVAGELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES SHE WAS A SORT OF CONTINUAL SUNDAY CHILD
5636-41792-0015 WITH AN AIR OF CHURCH AND COLD DINNER AND SERMON READING AND HYMN SINGING AND EARLY BED NOBODY COULD FEAR AS FOR SOME IMPULSIVE RECKLESS LITTLE CREATURE THAT SHE WOULD COME TO A BAD END
5636-41792-0016 NANCY SAID NO ONE COULD IMAGINE HER AS COMING TO ANYTHING NOT EVEN AN END
5636-41792-0017 KATHLEEN REMARKED ONCE BUT REALLY AND TRULY
5636-41792-0018 AND ENDEAVOR TO PLEASE THE ANGELS NOT JULIA'S CAST IRON ANGELS BUT THE OTHER ANGELS WHO UNDERSTAND AND ARE PATIENT BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER OUR FRAMES AND KNOW THAT BEING DUST WE ARE LIKELY TO BE DUSTY ONCE IN A WHILE
5636-41792-0019 JULIA WASN'T MADE OF DUST SHE WAS MADE OF LET ME SEE
5636-41792-0020 THE WATERY KIND AND RICE FLOUR AND GELATINE WITH A VERY LITTLE PIECE OF OVERRIPE BANANA NOT ENOUGH TO FLAVOR JUST ENOUGH TO SICKEN STIR THIS UP WITH WEAK BARLEY WATER
5636-41792-0021 WITHOUT PUTTING IN A TRACE OF SALT SUGAR SPICE OR PEPPER SET IT IN A COOL OVEN
5636-41792-0022 AND YOU WILL GET JULIA NANCY WAS TRIUMPHANT OVER THIS RECIPE FOR MAKING JULIAS ONLY REGRETTING THAT SHE COULD NEVER SHOW IT TO HER MOTHER WHO IF CRITICAL WAS ALWAYS MOST APPRECIATIVE
5636-41792-0023 SHE DID SEND IT IN A LETTER TO THE ADMIRAL OFF IN CHINA AND HE BEING NONE TOO GOOD FOR HUMAN NATURE'S DAILY FOOD ENJOYED IT HUGELY AND NEVER SCOLDED HER AT ALL JULIA'S ONLY CONVERSATION AT THIS TIME
5636-41792-0024 HER BREAKFAST ON A TRAY IN BED HER DIAMOND RING HER PHOTOGRAPH IN THE SUNDAY TIMES HER TRAVELS ABROAD HER PROFICIENCY IN FRENCH AND GERMAN DON'T TROT GLADYS INTO THE KITCHEN FOR GOODNESS SAKE JULIA
5636-41792-0025 GRUMBLED NANCY ON A WARM DAY I DON'T WANT HER DIAMOND RING IN MY DISHWATER WAIT TILL SUNDAY WHEN WE GO TO THE HOTEL FOR DINNER IN OUR BEST CLOTHES IF YOU MUST TALK ABOUT HER
5636-41792-0026 ALL RIGHT SAID JULIA GENTLY ONLY I HOPE I SHALL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO WIPE DISHES AND KEEP MY MIND ON BETTER THINGS AT THE SAME TIME THAT'S WHAT MISS TEWKSBURY TOLD ME
5636-41792-0027 DON'T LET POVERTY DRAG YOU DOWN JULIA SHE SAID KEEP YOUR HIGH THOUGHTS AND DON'T LET THEM GET SOILED WITH THE GRIME OF DAILY LIVING IT IS ONLY JUST TO SAY
5636-41792-0028 THAT NANCY WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY DESTITUTE OF SELF CONTROL AND POLITENESS BECAUSE AT THIS MOMENT SHE HAD A REALLY VICIOUS DESIRE TO WASH JULIA'S SUPERCILIOUS FACE AND NEAT NOSE WITH THE DISHCLOTH FRESH FROM THE FRYING PAN
5636-41792-0029 BUT JULIA'S FACE WAS WITHIN HER REACH AND NANCY'S FINGERS TINGLED WITH DESIRE NO TRACE OF THIS SAVAGE IMPULSE APPEARED IN HER BEHAVIOR HOWEVER SHE RINSED THE DISHPAN TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN IN THE SINK AND GAVE THE WIPING TOWELS TO JULIA
5636-41792-0030 ARE SO DISGUSTING THEY DO SMELL NANCY THEY DO SAID NANCY STERNLY
5636-41792-0031 OUR PRINCIPAL CONCERN MUST BE TO KEEP MOTHER'S HIGH THOUGHTS FROM GRIME
5636-41792-0032 OH HOW JULIA DISLIKED NANCY AT THIS EPOCH IN THEIR COMMON HISTORY AND HOW CORDIALLY AND VIGOROUSLY THE DISLIKE WAS RETURNED MANY AN UNHAPPY MOMENT DID MOTHER CAREY HAVE OVER THE FEUD MOSTLY DEEP AND SILENT
5636-41792-0033 THAT WENT ON BETWEEN THESE TWO AND GILBERT'S ATTITUDE WAS NOT MUCH MORE HOPEFUL HE HAD FOUND A TIMETABLE OR SYLLABUS FOR THE DAY'S DOINGS OVER JULIA'S WASHSTAND IT HAD BEEN FRAMED UNDER MISS TEWKSBURY'S GUIDANCE
5636-41792-0034 WHO KNEW JULIA'S UNPUNCTUALITY AND LACK OF SYSTEM AND READ AS FOLLOWS SYLLABUS
5636-41792-0035 BATHE AND DRESS DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES
5636-41792-0036 NINE TO TEN STUDY TEN TO TWELVE PREPARATIONS FOR DINNER TWELVE TO ONE RECREATION TWO TO FOUR STUDY FOUR TO FIVE
5636-41792-0037 PREPARATION FOR SUPPER FIVE TO SIX WHOLESOME READING WALKING OR CONVERSATION SEVEN TO EIGHT DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES NINE BED
5636-41792-0038 INDEED IT WAS EXCELLENTLY CONCEIVED STILL IT APPEARED TO GILBERT AS EXCESSIVELY FUNNY AND WITH NANCY'S HELP HE WROTE ANOTHER SYLLABUS AND TACKED IT OVER JULIA'S BUREAU TIME CARD
5636-41792-0039 ON WAKING I CAN PRAY FOR GILLY AND NAN EAT BREAKFAST AT SEVEN OR TEN OR ELEVEN NOR THINK WHEN IT'S NOON THAT LUNCHEON'S TOO SOON FROM TWELVE UNTIL ONE I CAN MUNCH ON A BUN AT ONE OR AT TWO
5636-41792-0040 MY DINNER'LL BE DUE AT THREE SAY OR FOUR I'LL EAT A BIT MORE WHEN THE CLOCK'S STRIKING FIVE SOME MILD EXERCISE VERY BRIEF WOULD BE WISE LEST I LACK APPETITE FOR MY SUPPER AT NIGHT
5636-41792-0041 DON'T GO TO BED LATE EAT A LIGHT LUNCH AT EIGHT NOR FORGET TO SAY PRAYERS FOR MY COUSINS DOWNSTAIRS THEN WITH CONSCIENCE LIKE MINE I'LL BE SLEEPING AT NINE MISSUS CAREY HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR
5636-41792-0042 AND WHEN THE WEEPING JULIA BROUGHT THE TWO DOCUMENTS TO HER FOR CONSIDERATION SHE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ADJUSTING THE MATTER GRAVELY AND WITH DUE SYMPATHY FOR HER NIECE
5636-41792-0043 JULIA WAILED THEY WERE ALWAYS TRYING
5636-41792-0044 SAID MISSUS CAREY THEY FORGET THAT YOU ARE NOT USED TO IT BUT I WILL TRY TO MAKE THEM MORE CONSIDERATE
