5914-52087-0000 TO REDUCE BULGES IN A METAL POWDER FLASK FILL IT UP WITH INDIAN CORN OR DRY PEAS OF ANY OTHER SORT OF HARD GRAIN THEN POUR WATER INTO IT AND SCREW DOWN THE LID TIGHTLY
5914-52087-0001 THE GRAIN WILL SWELL AT FIRST SLOWLY AND THEN VERY RAPIDLY AND THE FLASK WILL RESUME ITS FORMER DIMENSIONS OR BURST IF IT IS NOT WATCHED PEAS DO NOT BEGIN TO SWELL FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS OR MORE POWDER HORN TO MAKE
5914-52087-0002 SAW OFF THE REQUIRED LENGTH FROM AN OX'S HORN FLATTEN IT SOMEWHAT BY HEAT SEE HORN FIT A WOODEN BOTTOM INTO IT CAULK IT WELL AND SEW RAW HIDE ROUND THE EDGE TO KEEP ALL TIGHT THE MOUTH MUST BE SECURED BY A PLUG
5914-52087-0003 WHICH MAY BE HOLLOWED TO MAKE A CHARGER PIECES OF CANE OF LARGE DIAMETER AND OLD GUNPOWDER CANISTERS SEWN UP IN HIDE MAKE USEFUL POWDER FLASKS PERCUSSION CAPS
5914-52087-0004 CAPS MAY BE CARRIED VERY CONVENIENTLY BY MEANS OF A RING WITH TWO DOZEN NIPPLE SHAPED BEADS MADE OF SOME METAL STRUNG UPON IT EACH BEAD BEING INTENDED TO BE COVERED BY A PERCUSSION CAP
5914-52087-0005 WITHOUT THIS CONTRIVANCE TO KEEP CAPS FREE FROM SAND CRUMBS AND DIRT YET ALWAYS AT HAND WHEN REQUIRED I CAN CONFIDENTLY RECOMMEND IT THOUGH AS IT IS OLD FASHIONED AND NOT WELL SUITED FOR SPORTSMEN IN ENGLAND IT IS RARELY TO BE MET WITH
5914-52087-0006 SPRING CAP HOLDERS ARE I AM SURE TOO DELICATE FOR ROUGH TRAVEL TO PROTECT CAPS FROM THE RAIN BEFORE STALKING OR WATCHING AT NIGHT IN RAINY WEATHER WAX OR GREASE THE EDGE OF THE CAP AS IT RESTS ON THE NIPPLE
5914-52087-0007 IT WILL THUS BECOME PROOF AGAINST WATER AND DAMP AIR SOME PERSONS CARRY A PIECE OF GREASE WITH THEM WHEN SHOOTING IN WET WEATHER AND WITH IT THEY SMEAR THE TOP OF THE NIPPLE AFTER EACH LOADING BEFORE PUTTING ON THE FRESH CAP
5914-52087-0008 IT IS SAID THAT THE GREASE DOES NOT PREVENT THE FULL ACTION OF THE CAP UPON THE POWDER A SPORTSMAN HAS RECOMMENDED TO ME A COUPLE OF WELL MARKED CAPS INTO THE HEADS OF WHICH SMALL WADS OF CORK HAVE BEEN FITTED
5914-52087-0009 HE USES THEM FOR LOADED GUNS THAT ARE TO BE LAID BY FOR SOME HOURS OR DAYS A BROAD LEAF WRAPPED LOOSELY ROUND THE LOCK OF A GUN WILL PROTECT IT DURING A HEAVY SHOWER
5914-52087-0010 ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ELASTICITY AND LIGHTNESS A LITTLE BINDING WITH WAXED THREAD MAY BE PUT ON AS SHOWN IN THE SKETCH TO PREVENT THE QUILL FROM SPLITTING WADDING
5914-52087-0011 SOME BIRDS NESTS ARE EXCELLENT FOR THE PURPOSE I AM TOLD THAT A DRY HIDE WILL NOT SERVE AS MATERIALS FOR WADS FLINTS
5914-52087-0012 THE BEST STONES TO CHOOSE FOR MAKING GUN FLINTS ARE THOSE THAT ARE NOT IRREGULAR IN SHAPE THEY SHOULD HAVE WHEN BROKEN A GREASY LUSTRE AND BE PARTICULARLY SMOOTH AND FINE GRAINED
5914-52087-0013 THE COLOUR IS OF NO IMPORTANCE BUT IT SHOULD BE UNIFORM IN THE SAME LUMP AND THE MORE TRANSPARENT THE STONES THE BETTER GUN FLINTS ARE MADE WITH A HAMMER AND A CHISEL OF STEEL THAT IS NOT HARDENED
5914-52087-0014 THE STONE IS CHIPPED BY THE HAMMER ALONE INTO PIECES OF THE REQUIRED THICKNESS WHICH ARE FASHIONED BY BEING LAID UPON THE FIXED CHISEL AND HAMMERED AGAINST IT
5914-52087-0015 TO MAKE ONE GUN FLINT GUNPOWDER TO CARRY GUNPOWDER WRAP IT UP IN FLANNEL OR LEATHER NOT IN PAPER COTTON OR LINEN BECAUSE THESE WILL CATCH FIRE OR SMOULDER LIKE TINDER WHILST THE FORMER WILL DO NEITHER
5914-52087-0016 THE ONE NOR THE OTHER GUNPOWDER CARRIED IN A GOAT SKIN BAG TRAVELS VERY SAFELY MISTER GREGORY CARRIED HIS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FLOUR
5914-52087-0017 DURING HIS NORTH AUSTRALIAN EXPEDITION HAD A TIN OF GUNPOWDER IN THE MIDDLE OF IT TO MAKE GUNPOWDER IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE GOOD GUNPOWDER
5914-52087-0018 EVERY PEASANT MANUFACTURES IT FOR HIMSELF
5914-52087-0019 TAKE ONE POUNDS OF CHARCOAL ONE POUNDS OF SULPHUR
5914-52087-0020 WITH ONE STONE ON ANOTHER JUST AS TRAVELLERS USUALLY MAKE MEAL OR GRIND COFFEE
5914-52087-0021 WHICH IS WELL SHAKEN ABOUT AND IN THIS WAY THE GRAINS RUN EACH OTHER SMOOTH THE FINE DUST THAT IS THEN FOUND MIXED WITH THE GRAINS MUST BE WINNOWED AWAY LASTLY THE GRAINS ARE DRIED RECAPITULATION
5914-52087-0022 POUND THE INGREDIENTS SEPARATELY
5914-52087-0023 MIX THEM THREE ADD A LITTLE WATER AND KNEAD THE MASS FOUR PRESS IT FIVE
5914-52087-0024 AND THEN PROCEED AS ALREADY DESCRIBED
5914-52087-0025 LIGHT WOODS THAT GIVE A POROUS CHARCOAL ARE THE BEST AS POPLAR ALDER LIME HORSE CHESTNUT WILLOW HAZEL NUT AND ELDER IT SHOULD BE MADE WITH THE GREATEST CARE AND USED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTERWARDS
5914-52087-0026 IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT IN GUNPOWDER SULPHUR THE LUMPS MUST BE MELTED OVER A GENTLE FIRE
5914-52087-0027 FLOWER OF SULPHUR IS QUITE PURE SALTPETRE DISSOLVE THE SALTPETRE THAT YOU WISH TO PURIFY IN AN EQUAL MEASURE OF BOILING WATER A CUPFUL OF ONE TO A CUPFUL OF THE OTHER
5914-52087-0028 IT IS ALSO FOUND COPIOUSLY ON THE GROUND IN MANY PLACES IN SALTPANS OR SIMPLY AS AN EFFLORESENCE RUBBISH SUCH AS OLD MUD HUTS AND MORTAR GENERALLY ABOUNDS WITH IT
5914-52087-0029 IT IS MADE BY THE ACTION OF THE AIR ON THE POTASH CONTAINED IN THE EARTHS THE TASTE WHICH IS THAT OF GUNPOWDER IS THE BEST TEST OF ITS PRESENCE TO EXTRACT IT POUR HOT WATER ON THE MASS THEN EVAPORATE AND PURIFY
5914-52087-0030 IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT WHEN ROCKETS ARE CHARGED WITH THE COMPOSITION A HOLLOW TUBE MUST BE LEFT DOWN THEIR MIDDLE BLUE FIRE
5914-52087-0031 TWO PARTS NITRE THREE PARTS SULPHUR THREE PARTS ZINC BENGAL FIRE
5914-52087-0032 TWO PARTS SULPHUR ONE PART ANTIMONY BULLETS SPORTSMEN FRESH FROM ENGLAND AND ACKNOWLEDGED AS GOOD SHOTS AT HOME BEGIN BY SHOOTING VILELY WITH BALLS AT LARGE GAME
5914-52087-0033 FOR THE LATTER PENETRATE MUCH MORE DEEPLY AND BREAK BONES INSTEAD OF FLATTENING AGAINST THEM A MIXTURE OF VERY LITTLE TIN OR PEWTER WHICH IS LEAD AND TIN WITH LEAD HARDENS IT
5914-52087-0034 WE READ OF SPORTSMEN MELTING UP THEIR SPOONS AND DISHES FOR THIS PURPOSE A LITTLE QUICKSILVER HAS THE SAME EFFECT SIR SAMUEL BAKER WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED SPORTSMEN
5914-52087-0035 LATTERLY USED A MIXTURE OF NINE TENTHS LEAD AND ONE TENTH QUICKSILVER FOR HIS BULLETS HE SAYS THIS IS SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER MIXTURES FOR THAT PURPOSE AS IT COMBINES HARDNESS WITH EXTRA WEIGHT
5914-52087-0036 THE LEAD MUST BE MELTED IN A POT BY ITSELF TO A RED HEAT AND THE PROPORTION OF QUICKSILVER MUST BE ADDED A LADLEFUL AT A TIME AND STIRRED QUICKLY WITH A PIECE OF IRON JUST IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY TO MAKE THREE OR FOUR BULLETS
5914-52087-0037 IF THE QUICKSILVER IS SUBJECTED TO RED HEAT IN THE LARGE LEADPOT IT WILL EVAPORATE PROPER ALLOY OR SPELTER HAD BEST BE ORDERED AT A GUN MAKER'S SHOP AND TAKEN FROM ENGLAND INSTEAD OF LEAD DIFFERENT ALLOYS OF SPELTER
5914-52087-0038 VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR DEGREE OF HARDNESS AND THEREFORE MORE THAN ONE SPECIMEN SHOULD BE TRIED SHAPE OF BULLETS ROUND IRON BULLETS ARE WORTHLESS EXCEPT AT VERY CLOSE QUARTERS ON ACCOUNT OF THE LIGHTNESS OF THE METAL
5914-52087-0039 FOR THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR CHECKS THEIR FORCE EXTREMELY WHETHER ELONGATED IRON BULLETS WOULD SUCCEED REMAINS TO BE TRIED SOME SAVAGES AS FOR INSTANCE THOSE OF TIMOR WHEN IN WANT OF BULLETS USE STONES TWO OR THREE INCHES LONG
5914-52087-0040 SOME GOOD SPORTSMEN INSIST ON THE ADVANTAGE FOR SHOOTING AT VERY CLOSE QUARTERS OF CLEAVING A CONICAL BULLET NEARLY DOWN TO ITS BASE INTO FOUR PARTS THESE PARTLY SEPARATE AND MAKE A FEARFUL WOUND
5914-52087-0041 WHEN IT STRIKES IT ACTS LIKE CHAIN SHOT BULLETS TO CARRY BULLETS SHOULD BE CARRIED SEWN UP IN THEIR PATCHES FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF LOADING AND THEY SHOULD NOT FIT TOO TIGHT
5914-52087-0042 A FEW MAY BE CARRIED BARE FOR THE SAKE OF RAPID LOADING RECOVERING BULLETS WHEN AMMUNITION IS SCARCE MAKE A PRACTICE OF RECOVERING THE BULLETS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SHOT INTO A BEAST IF THEY ARE OF SPELTER
5914-52087-0043 THEY WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN VERY LITTLE KNOCKED OUT OF SHAPE AND MAY OFTEN BE USED AGAIN WITHOUT RECASTING SHOT AND SLUGS TRAVELLERS FREQUENTLY OMIT TO TAKE ENOUGH SHOT WHICH IS A GREAT MISTAKE AS BIRDS ARE ALWAYS TO BE FOUND
5914-52087-0044 AND THE MORE PELLETS THE MORE EXECUTION IF BIRDS ARE TO BE KILLED FOR STUFFING DUST SHOT WILL ALSO BE WANTED OTHERWISE IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY BETTER TO TAKE ONLY ONE SIZE OF SHOT
5914-52087-0045 THE SHOT ARE SORTED BY SIEVES
