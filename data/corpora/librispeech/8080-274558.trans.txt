8080-274558-0000 JUNE WEATHER PERMITTING AND ON THE FOURTEENTH I WENT ON BOARD TO ARRANGE SOME MATTERS IN MY STATE ROOM I FOUND THAT WE WERE TO HAVE A GREAT MANY PASSENGERS INCLUDING A MORE THAN USUAL NUMBER OF LADIES
8080-274558-0001 ON THE LIST WERE SEVERAL OF MY ACQUAINTANCES AND AMONG OTHER NAMES I WAS REJOICED TO SEE THAT OF MISTER CORNELIUS WYATT A YOUNG ARTIST FOR WHOM I ENTERTAINED FEELINGS OF WARM FRIENDSHIP
8080-274558-0002 HE HAD BEEN WITH ME A FELLOW STUDENT AT C UNIVERSITY WHERE WE WERE VERY MUCH TOGETHER HE HAD THE ORDINARY TEMPERAMENT OF GENIUS AND WAS A COMPOUND OF MISANTHROPY SENSIBILITY AND ENTHUSIASM
8080-274558-0003 TO THESE QUALITIES HE UNITED THE WARMEST AND TRUEST HEART WHICH EVER BEAT IN A HUMAN BOSOM I OBSERVED THAT HIS NAME WAS CARDED UPON THREE STATE ROOMS AND UPON AGAIN REFERRING TO THE LIST OF PASSENGERS
8080-274558-0004 I FOUND THAT HE HAD ENGAGED PASSAGE FOR HIMSELF WIFE AND TWO SISTERS HIS OWN THE STATE ROOMS WERE SUFFICIENTLY ROOMY AND EACH HAD TWO BERTHS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER THESE BERTHS TO BE SURE
8080-274558-0005 WERE SO EXCEEDINGLY NARROW AS TO BE INSUFFICIENT FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON STILL I COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY THERE WERE THREE STATE ROOMS FOR THESE FOUR PERSONS I WAS JUST AT THAT EPOCH
8080-274558-0006 THAT I BUSIED MYSELF IN A VARIETY OF ILL BRED AND PREPOSTEROUS CONJECTURES ABOUT THIS MATTER OF THE SUPERNUMERARY STATE ROOM IT WAS NO BUSINESS OF MINE TO BE SURE
8080-274558-0007 IT HAD BEEN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN TO BRING ONE FOR THE WORDS AND SERVANT HAD BEEN FIRST WRITTEN AND THEN OVERSCORED OH EXTRA BAGGAGE TO BE SURE I NOW SAID TO MYSELF SOMETHING HE WISHES NOT TO BE PUT IN THE HOLD
8080-274558-0008 SOMETHING TO BE KEPT UNDER HIS OWN EYE AH I HAVE IT A PAINTING OR SO AND THIS IS WHAT HE HAS BEEN BARGAINING ABOUT WITH NICOLINO THE ITALIAN JEW THIS IDEA SATISFIED ME
8080-274558-0009 HE HAD OFTEN TALKED ABOUT HER IN MY PRESENCE HOWEVER AND IN HIS USUAL STYLE OF ENTHUSIASM HE DESCRIBED HER AS OF SURPASSING BEAUTY WIT AND ACCOMPLISHMENT I WAS THEREFORE
8080-274558-0010 QUITE ANXIOUS TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE ON THE DAY IN WHICH I VISITED THE SHIP THE FOURTEENTH WYATT AND PARTY WERE ALSO TO VISIT IT SO THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME AND I WAITED ON BOARD AN HOUR LONGER THAN I HAD DESIGNED
8080-274558-0011 THE MORROW HAVING ARRIVED I WAS GOING FROM MY HOTEL TO THE WHARF WHEN CAPTAIN HARDY MET ME AND SAID THAT OWING TO CIRCUMSTANCES A STUPID BUT CONVENIENT PHRASE
8080-274558-0012 HE RATHER THOUGHT THE INDEPENDENCE WOULD NOT SAIL FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THAT WHEN ALL WAS READY HE WOULD SEND UP AND LET ME KNOW THIS I THOUGHT STRANGE FOR THERE WAS A STIFF SOUTHERLY BREEZE BUT AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES
8080-274558-0013 WERE NOT FORTHCOMING ALTHOUGH I PUMPED FOR THEM WITH MUCH PERSEVERANCE I HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO RETURN HOME AND DIGEST MY IMPATIENCE AT LEISURE
8080-274558-0014 I DID NOT RECEIVE THE EXPECTED MESSAGE FROM THE CAPTAIN FOR NEARLY A WEEK IT CAME AT LENGTH HOWEVER AND I IMMEDIATELY WENT ON BOARD THE SHIP WAS CROWDED WITH PASSENGERS
8080-274558-0015 AND EVERY THING WAS IN THE BUSTLE ATTENDANT UPON MAKING SAIL WYATT'S PARTY ARRIVED IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER MYSELF THERE WERE THE TWO SISTERS THE BRIDE AND THE ARTIST THE LATTER IN ONE OF HIS CUSTOMARY FITS OF
8080-274558-0016 MOODY MISANTHROPY I WAS TOO WELL USED TO THESE HOWEVER TO PAY THEM ANY SPECIAL ATTENTION HE DID NOT EVEN INTRODUCE ME TO HIS WIFE THIS COURTESY DEVOLVING PER FORCE UPON HIS SISTER MARIAN
8080-274558-0017 A VERY SWEET AND INTELLIGENT GIRL WHO IN A FEW HURRIED WORDS MADE US ACQUAINTED MISSUS WYATT HAD BEEN CLOSELY VEILED AND WHEN SHE RAISED HER VEIL IN ACKNOWLEDGING MY BOW
8080-274558-0018 I CONFESS THAT I WAS VERY PROFOUNDLY ASTONISHED I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE SO HOWEVER HAD NOT LONG EXPERIENCE ADVISED ME NOT TO TRUST WITH TOO IMPLICIT A RELIANCE THE ENTHUSIASTIC DESCRIPTIONS OF MY FRIEND
8080-274558-0019 THE ARTIST WHEN INDULGING IN COMMENTS UPON THE LOVELINESS OF WOMAN WHEN BEAUTY WAS THE THEME I WELL KNEW WITH WHAT FACILITY HE SOARED INTO THE REGIONS OF THE PURELY IDEAL THE TRUTH IS
8080-274558-0020 I COULD NOT HELP REGARDING MISSUS WYATT AS A DECIDEDLY PLAIN LOOKING WOMAN IF NOT POSITIVELY UGLY SHE WAS NOT I THINK VERY FAR FROM IT SHE WAS DRESSED HOWEVER IN EXQUISITE TASTE
8080-274558-0021 AND THEN I HAD NO DOUBT THAT SHE HAD CAPTIVATED MY FRIEND'S HEART BY THE MORE ENDURING GRACES OF THE INTELLECT AND SOUL SHE SAID VERY FEW WORDS AND PASSED AT ONCE INTO HER STATE ROOM WITH MISTER W
8080-274558-0022 MY OLD INQUISITIVENESS NOW RETURNED THERE WAS NO SERVANT THAT WAS A SETTLED POINT I LOOKED THEREFORE FOR THE EXTRA BAGGAGE AFTER SOME DELAY A CART ARRIVED AT THE WHARF
8080-274558-0023 AND NO SOONER HAD I SEEN IT THAN I TOOK CREDIT TO MYSELF FOR THE ACCURACY OF MY GUESSING I HAD REACHED THE CONCLUSION IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE EXTRA BAGGAGE OF MY FRIEND THE ARTIST WOULD PROVE TO BE PICTURES
8080-274558-0024 OR AT LEAST A PICTURE FOR I KNEW HE HAD BEEN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS IN CONFERENCE WITH NICOLINO AND NOW HERE WAS A BOX WHICH FROM ITS SHAPE COULD POSSIBLY CONTAIN NOTHING IN THE WORLD
8080-274558-0025 I CONSIDERED AS SUFFICIENTLY SETTLED I CHUCKLED EXCESSIVELY WHEN I THOUGHT OF MY ACUMEN IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER KNOWN WYATT TO KEEP FROM ME ANY OF HIS ARTISTICAL SECRETS
8080-274558-0026 BUT HERE HE EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO STEAL A MARCH UPON ME AND SMUGGLE A FINE PICTURE TO NEW YORK UNDER MY VERY NOSE EXPECTING ME TO KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER I RESOLVED TO QUIZ HIM WELL
8080-274558-0027 OCCUPYING VERY NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE FLOOR NO DOUBT TO THE EXCEEDING DISCOMFORT OF THE ARTIST AND HIS WIFE THIS THE MORE ESPECIALLY AS THE TAR OR PAINT WITH WHICH IT WAS LETTERED IN SPRAWLING CAPITALS
8080-274558-0028 THIS SIDE UP TO BE HANDLED WITH CARE NOW I WAS AWARE THAT MISSUS ADELAIDE CURTIS OF ALBANY WAS THE ARTIST'S WIFE'S MOTHER
8080-274558-0029 IN CHAMBERS STREET NEW YORK FOR THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR DAYS WE HAD FINE WEATHER ALTHOUGH THE WIND WAS DEAD AHEAD HAVING CHOPPED ROUND TO THE NORTHWARD IMMEDIATELY UPON OUR LOSING SIGHT OF THE COAST
8080-274558-0030 THE PASSENGERS WERE CONSEQUENTLY IN HIGH SPIRITS AND DISPOSED TO BE SOCIAL I MUST EXCEPT HOWEVER WYATT AND HIS SISTERS WHO BEHAVED STIFFLY AND I COULD NOT HELP THINKING
8080-274558-0031 FOR THE SISTERS HOWEVER I COULD MAKE NO EXCUSE THEY SECLUDED THEMSELVES IN THEIR STATEROOMS DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE PASSAGE AND ABSOLUTELY REFUSED ALTHOUGH I REPEATEDLY URGED THEM
8080-274558-0032 TO HOLD COMMUNICATION WITH ANY PERSON ON BOARD MISSUS WYATT HERSELF WAS FAR MORE AGREEABLE THAT IS TO SAY SHE WAS CHATTY AND TO BE CHATTY IS NO SLIGHT RECOMMENDATION AT SEA
8080-274558-0033 AND TO MY PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT EVINCED NO EQUIVOCAL DISPOSITION TO COQUET WITH THE MEN SHE AMUSED US ALL VERY MUCH I SAY AMUSED AND SCARCELY KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN MYSELF
