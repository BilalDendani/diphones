5118-111612-0006 LINES THAT SEEM TO HIM TO HAVE GROWN SO STALE AND DISREPUTABLY STUPID AND WHICH THE INGENUITY OF THE PLAYERS CONTRIVES TO INSTILL WITH LIFE
5118-111612-0007 WITH A SENSE OF SHAME INDEED DOES HE REFLECT THAT BECAUSE ONE DAY LONG AGO HE WAS STRUCK WITH A PREPOSTEROUS IDEA HERE ARE HONEST FOLK

5118-111612-0027 IN AN UNSEEMLY WAY BUT WHEN YOU ARE TROUPING THE FIRST THING YOU DO AFTER REGISTERING AT THE HOTEL IS TO GO OUT AND SCOUT ROUND THE TOWN YEARNING FOR BILLBOARDS AND COMPLAINING BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM
5118-111612-0028 THEN YOU SET OUT TO SEE WHAT OPPOSITION YOU ARE PLAYING AGAINST
5118-111612-0029 THE MILLION DOLLAR DOLL IN PARIS IS ALSO IN TOWN OR HARRY BULGER'S GIRLY SHOW WILL BE THERE THE FOLLOWING EVENING OR MACK SENNETT'S BATHING BEAUTIES IN PERSON THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF THEY FALL FOR
