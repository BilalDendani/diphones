1629-139707-0000 THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE VERY WELL DISPOSED TO LIKE THEIR NEW QUEEN AND TO RECEIVE HER WITH GREAT FAVOUR WHEN SHE CAME AMONG THEM AS A STRANGER BUT SHE HELD THE PROTESTANT RELIGION IN GREAT DISLIKE AND BROUGHT OVER A CROWD OF UNPLEASANT PRIESTS WHO MADE HER DO SOME VERY RIDICULOUS THINGS
1629-139707-0001 AND FORCED THEMSELVES UPON THE PUBLIC NOTICE IN MANY DISAGREEABLE WAYS HENCE THE PEOPLE SOON CAME TO DISLIKE HER AND SHE SOON CAME TO DISLIKE THEM AND SHE DID SO MUCH ALL THROUGH THIS REIGN IN SETTING THE KING WHO WAS DOTINGLY FOND OF HER
1629-139707-0002 HE NEVER TOOK A STRAIGHT COURSE BUT ALWAYS TOOK A CROOKED ONE HE WAS BENT UPON WAR WITH SPAIN THOUGH NEITHER THE HOUSE OF COMMONS NOR THE PEOPLE WERE QUITE CLEAR AS TO THE JUSTICE OF THAT WAR NOW THAT THEY BEGAN TO THINK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE STORY OF THE SPANISH MATCH BUT THE KING RUSHED INTO IT HOTLY
1629-139707-0003 RAISED MONEY BY ILLEGAL MEANS TO MEET ITS EXPENSES AND ENCOUNTERED A MISERABLE FAILURE AT CADIZ IN THE VERY FIRST YEAR OF HIS REIGN AN EXPEDITION TO CADIZ HAD BEEN MADE IN THE HOPE OF PLUNDER BUT AS IT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IT WAS NECESSARY TO GET A GRANT OF MONEY FROM THE PARLIAMENT
1629-139707-0004 AND WHEN THEY MET IN NO VERY COMPLYING HUMOUR THE KING TOLD THEM TO MAKE HASTE TO LET HIM HAVE IT OR IT WOULD BE THE WORSE FOR THEMSELVES NOT PUT IN A MORE COMPLYING HUMOUR BY THIS THEY IMPEACHED THE KING'S FAVOURITE THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM AS THE CAUSE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY WAS
1629-139707-0005 OF MANY GREAT PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND WRONGS THE KING TO SAVE HIM DISSOLVED THE PARLIAMENT WITHOUT GETTING THE MONEY HE WANTED AND WHEN THE LORDS IMPLORED HIM TO CONSIDER AND GRANT A LITTLE DELAY HE REPLIED NO NOT ONE MINUTE
1629-139707-0006 HE THEN BEGAN TO RAISE MONEY FOR HIMSELF BY THE FOLLOWING MEANS AMONG OTHERS HE LEVIED CERTAIN DUTIES CALLED TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN GRANTED BY THE PARLIAMENT AND COULD LAWFULLY BE LEVIED BY NO OTHER POWER HE CALLED UPON THE SEAPORT TOWNS TO FURNISH
1629-139707-0007 AND TO PAY ALL THE COST FOR THREE MONTHS OF A FLEET OF ARMED SHIPS AND HE REQUIRED THE PEOPLE TO UNITE IN LENDING HIM LARGE SUMS OF MONEY THE REPAYMENT OF WHICH WAS VERY DOUBTFUL IF THE POOR PEOPLE REFUSED THEY WERE PRESSED AS SOLDIERS OR SAILORS IF THE GENTRY REFUSED THEY WERE SENT TO PRISON
1629-139707-0008 FIVE GENTLEMEN NAMED SIR THOMAS DARNEL JOHN CORBET WALTER EARL JOHN HEVENINGHAM
1629-139707-0009 AND WERE SENT TO PRISON WITHOUT ANY CAUSE BUT THE KING'S PLEASURE BEING STATED FOR THEIR IMPRISONMENT THEN THE QUESTION CAME TO BE SOLEMNLY TRIED WHETHER THIS WAS NOT A VIOLATION OF MAGNA CHARTA AND AN ENCROACHMENT BY THE KING ON THE HIGHEST RIGHTS OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE
1629-139707-0010 HIS LAWYERS CONTENDED NO BECAUSE TO ENCROACH UPON THE RIGHTS OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WOULD BE TO DO WRONG AND THE KING COULD DO NO WRONG THE ACCOMMODATING JUDGES DECIDED IN FAVOUR OF THIS WICKED NONSENSE AND HERE WAS A FATAL DIVISION BETWEEN THE KING AND THE PEOPLE
1629-139707-0011 FOR ALL THIS IT BECAME NECESSARY TO CALL ANOTHER PARLIAMENT THE PEOPLE SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER IN WHICH THEIR LIBERTIES WERE CHOSE FOR IT THOSE WHO WERE BEST KNOWN FOR THEIR DETERMINED OPPOSITION TO THE KING BUT STILL THE KING QUITE BLINDED BY HIS DETERMINATION TO CARRY EVERYTHING BEFORE HIM
1629-139707-0012 ADDRESSED THEM WHEN THEY MET IN A CONTEMPTUOUS MANNER AND JUST TOLD THEM IN SO MANY WORDS THAT HE HAD ONLY CALLED THEM TOGETHER BECAUSE HE WANTED MONEY THE PARLIAMENT STRONG ENOUGH AND RESOLUTE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULD LOWER HIS TONE CARED LITTLE FOR WHAT HE SAID AND LAID BEFORE HIM ONE OF THE GREAT DOCUMENTS OF HISTORY
1629-139707-0013 IT BEING CONTRARY TO THEIR RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES AND THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRY AT FIRST THE KING RETURNED AN ANSWER TO THIS PETITION IN WHICH HE TRIED TO SHIRK IT ALTOGETHER BUT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THEN SHOWING THEIR DETERMINATION TO GO ON WITH THE IMPEACHMENT OF BUCKINGHAM THE KING IN ALARM RETURNED AN ANSWER
1629-139707-0014 GIVING HIS CONSENT TO ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM HE NOT ONLY AFTERWARDS DEPARTED FROM HIS WORD AND HONOUR ON THESE POINTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT AT THIS VERY TIME HE DID THE MEAN AND DISSEMBLING ACT OF PUBLISHING HIS FIRST ANSWER AND NOT HIS SECOND
1629-139707-0015 MERELY THAT THE PEOPLE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT THE PARLIAMENT HAD NOT GOT THE BETTER OF HIM THAT PESTILENT BUCKINGHAM
1629-139707-0016 FOR SUCH MISERABLE CAUSES AND SUCH MISERABLE CREATURES ARE WARS SOMETIMES MADE BUT HE WAS DESTINED TO DO LITTLE MORE MISCHIEF IN THIS WORLD ONE MORNING AS HE WAS GOING OUT OF HIS HOUSE TO HIS CARRIAGE
1629-139707-0017 AND HE WAS VIOLENTLY STABBED WITH A KNIFE WHICH THE MURDERER LEFT STICKING IN HIS HEART
1629-139707-0018 HE HAD HAD ANGRY WORDS UP STAIRS JUST BEFORE WITH SOME FRENCH GENTLEMEN WHO WERE IMMEDIATELY SUSPECTED BY HIS SERVANTS AND HAD A CLOSE ESCAPE FROM BEING SET UPON AND KILLED IN THE MIDST OF THE NOISE THE REAL MURDERER WHO HAD GONE TO THE KITCHEN AND MIGHT EASILY HAVE GOT AWAY DREW HIS SWORD AND CRIED OUT I AM THE MAN
1629-139707-0019 HIS NAME WAS JOHN FELTON A PROTESTANT AND A RETIRED OFFICER IN THE ARMY
1629-139707-0020 AND THEN HE DREW OUT THE KNIFE FELL AGAINST A TABLE AND DIED THE COUNCIL MADE A MIGHTY BUSINESS OF EXAMINING JOHN FELTON ABOUT THIS MURDER THOUGH IT WAS A PLAIN CASE ENOUGH ONE WOULD THINK HE HAD COME SEVENTY MILES TO DO IT HE TOLD THEM AND HE DID IT FOR THE REASON HE HAD DECLARED
1629-139707-0021 BUT AS THE JUDGES NOW FOUND OUT THAT TORTURE WAS CONTRARY TO THE LAW OF ENGLAND IT IS A PITY THEY DID NOT MAKE THE DISCOVERY A LITTLE SOONER JOHN FELTON WAS SIMPLY EXECUTED FOR THE MURDER HE HAD DONE A MURDER IT UNDOUBTEDLY WAS AND NOT IN THE LEAST TO BE DEFENDED
1629-139707-0022 THOUGH HE HAD FREED ENGLAND FROM ONE OF THE MOST PROFLIGATE CONTEMPTIBLE AND BASE COURT FAVOURITES TO WHOM IT HAS EVER YIELDED A VERY DIFFERENT MAN NOW AROSE THIS WAS SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH A YORKSHIRE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD SAT IN PARLIAMENT FOR A LONG TIME AND WHO HAD FAVOURED ARBITRARY AND HAUGHTY PRINCIPLES
1629-139707-0023 BUT WHO HAD GONE OVER TO THE PEOPLE'S SIDE ON RECEIVING OFFENCE FROM BUCKINGHAM THE KING MUCH WANTING SUCH A MAN FOR BESIDES BEING NATURALLY FAVOURABLE TO THE KING'S CAUSE HE HAD GREAT ABILITIES MADE HIM FIRST A BARON
1629-139707-0024 A PARLIAMENT HOWEVER WAS STILL IN EXISTENCE AND WAS NOT TO BE WON ON THE TWENTIETH OF JANUARY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE SIR JOHN ELIOT A GREAT MAN WHO HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN THE PETITION OF RIGHT BROUGHT FORWARD OTHER STRONG RESOLUTIONS AGAINST THE KING'S CHIEF INSTRUMENTS AND CALLED UPON THE SPEAKER TO PUT THEM TO THE VOTE
1629-139707-0025 TO THIS THE SPEAKER ANSWERED HE WAS COMMANDED OTHERWISE BY THE KING AND GOT UP TO LEAVE THE CHAIR WHICH ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WOULD HAVE OBLIGED IT TO ADJOURN WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING MORE WHEN TWO MEMBERS NAMED MISTER HOLLIS AND MISTER VALENTINE HELD HIM DOWN
1629-139707-0026 A SCENE OF GREAT CONFUSION AROSE AMONG THE MEMBERS AND WHILE MANY SWORDS WERE DRAWN AND FLASHING ABOUT THE KING WHO WAS KEPT INFORMED OF ALL THAT WAS GOING ON TOLD THE CAPTAIN OF HIS GUARD TO GO DOWN TO THE HOUSE AND FORCE THE DOORS THE RESOLUTIONS WERE BY THAT TIME HOWEVER VOTED AND THE HOUSE ADJOURNED
1629-139707-0027 AS THEY CLAIMED IT TO BE THEIR PRIVILEGE NOT TO ANSWER OUT OF PARLIAMENT FOR ANYTHING THEY HAD SAID IN IT THEY WERE COMMITTED TO THE TOWER THE KING THEN WENT DOWN AND DISSOLVED THE PARLIAMENT IN A SPEECH WHEREIN HE MADE MENTION OF THESE GENTLEMEN AS VIPERS'
1629-139707-0028 THE KING ALWAYS REMARKABLY UNFORGIVING NEVER OVERLOOKED THEIR OFFENCE WHEN THEY DEMANDED TO BE BROUGHT UP BEFORE THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH HE EVEN RESORTED TO THE MEANNESS OF HAVING THEM MOVED ABOUT FROM PRISON TO PRISON SO THAT THE WRITS ISSUED FOR THAT PURPOSE SHOULD NOT LEGALLY FIND THEM
1629-139707-0029 AT LAST THEY CAME BEFORE THE COURT AND WERE SENTENCED TO HEAVY FINES AND TO BE IMPRISONED DURING THE KING'S PLEASURE WHEN SIR JOHN ELIOT'S HEALTH HAD QUITE GIVEN WAY AND HE SO LONGED FOR CHANGE OF AIR AND SCENE AS TO PETITION FOR HIS RELEASE THE KING SENT BACK THE ANSWER WORTHY OF HIS SOWSHIP HIMSELF
1629-139707-0030 THAT THE PETITION WAS NOT HUMBLE ENOUGH WHEN HE SENT ANOTHER PETITION BY HIS YOUNG SON IN WHICH HE PATHETICALLY OFFERED TO GO BACK TO PRISON WHEN HIS HEALTH WAS RESTORED IF HE MIGHT BE RELEASED FOR ITS RECOVERY THE KING STILL DISREGARDED IT WHEN HE DIED IN THE TOWER AND HIS CHILDREN PETITIONED TO BE ALLOWED TO TAKE HIS BODY DOWN TO CORNWALL
1629-139707-0031 THERE TO LAY IT AMONG THE ASHES OF HIS FOREFATHERS THE KING RETURNED FOR ANSWER LET SIR JOHN ELIOT'S BODY BE BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF THAT PARISH WHERE HE DIED ALL THIS WAS LIKE A VERY LITTLE KING INDEED I THINK
1629-139707-0032 AND NOW FOR TWELVE LONG YEARS STEADILY PURSUING HIS DESIGN OF SETTING HIMSELF UP AND PUTTING THE PEOPLE DOWN THE KING CALLED NO PARLIAMENT BUT RULED WITHOUT ONE IF TWELVE THOUSAND VOLUMES WERE WRITTEN IN HIS PRAISE AS A GOOD MANY HAVE BEEN IT WOULD STILL REMAIN A FACT IMPOSSIBLE TO BE DENIED
1629-139707-0033 THAT FOR TWELVE YEARS KING CHARLES THE FIRST REIGNED IN ENGLAND UNLAWFULLY AND DESPOTICALLY SEIZED UPON HIS SUBJECTS GOODS AND MONEY AT HIS PLEASURE AND PUNISHED ACCORDING TO HIS UNBRIDLED WILL ALL WHO VENTURED TO OPPOSE HIM IT IS A FASHION WITH SOME PEOPLE TO THINK THAT THIS KING'S CAREER WAS CUT SHORT
1629-139707-0034 BUT I MUST SAY MYSELF THAT I THINK HE RAN A PRETTY LONG ONE WILLIAM LAUD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WAS THE KING'S RIGHT HAND MAN IN THE RELIGIOUS PART OF THE PUTTING DOWN OF THE PEOPLE'S LIBERTIES LAUD WHO WAS A SINCERE MAN OF LARGE LEARNING BUT SMALL SENSE
1629-139707-0035 FOR THE TWO THINGS SOMETIMES GO TOGETHER IN VERY DIFFERENT QUANTITIES THOUGH A PROTESTANT HELD OPINIONS SO NEAR THOSE OF THE CATHOLICS
1629-139707-0036 HE LOOKED UPON VOWS ROBES LIGHTED CANDLES IMAGES AND SO FORTH AS AMAZINGLY IMPORTANT IN RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES AND HE BROUGHT IN AN IMMENSITY OF BOWING AND CANDLE SNUFFING HE ALSO REGARDED ARCHBISHOPS AND BISHOPS AS A SORT OF MIRACULOUS PERSONS
1629-139707-0037 AND WAS INVETERATE IN THE LAST DEGREE AGAINST ANY WHO THOUGHT OTHERWISE ACCORDINGLY HE OFFERED UP THANKS TO HEAVEN AND WAS IN A STATE OF MUCH PIOUS PLEASURE WHEN A SCOTCH CLERGYMAN NAMED LEIGHTON WAS PILLORIED WHIPPED BRANDED IN THE CHEEK AND HAD ONE OF HIS EARS CUT OFF AND ONE OF HIS NOSTRILS SLIT
1629-139707-0038 FOR CALLING BISHOPS TRUMPERY AND THE INVENTIONS OF MEN HE ORIGINATED ON A SUNDAY MORNING THE PROSECUTION OF WILLIAM PRYNNE A BARRISTER WHO WAS OF SIMILAR OPINIONS AND WHO WAS FINED A THOUSAND POUNDS WHO WAS PILLORIED WHO HAD HIS EARS CUT OFF ON TWO OCCASIONS ONE EAR AT A TIME AND WHO WAS IMPRISONED FOR LIFE
1629-139707-0039 WHO WAS ALSO FINED A THOUSAND POUNDS AND WHO AFTERWARDS HAD HIS EARS CUT OFF AND WAS IMPRISONED FOR LIFE THESE WERE GENTLE METHODS OF PERSUASION SOME WILL TELL YOU I THINK THEY WERE RATHER CALCULATED TO BE ALARMING TO THE PEOPLE
1629-139707-0040 NOTWITHSTANDING THE GREAT COMPLAINTS THAT HAD FOR YEARS AND YEARS BEEN MADE ON THE SUBJECT OF MONOPOLIES
