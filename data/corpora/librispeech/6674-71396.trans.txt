6674-71396-0000 HE WORE AN OLD RUSTY BLACK COAT AND A SOFT HAT WITH A HOLE IN IT HIS FACE WAS TANNED AND PARTLY COVERED WITH A BEARD THE MAN WAS ACTING IN A MANNER TO EXCITE ANYBODY'S CURIOSITY HE CARRIED A STICK IN HIS HAND AND WAS POKING AROUND IN THE WATER WITH IT
6674-71396-0001 STRAINING HIS EYES ADAM ADAMS SAW A STRIP OF WHITE FLOATING ON THE WATER ONCE OR TWICE IT DISAPPEARED FINALLY THE END OF THE STRIP CAUGHT ON AN OVERHANGING BUSH AND THEN THE STRANGE MAN WITHDREW HIS CANE FROM THE BROOK
6674-71396-0002 AS HE TURNED AROUND THE DETECTIVE DODGED OUT OF SIGHT APPARENTLY SATISFIED THAT HE WAS NOT OBSERVED THE STRANGE MAN LEANED DOWN AT THE BANK OF THE BROOK TOOK SOMETHING FROM HIS POCKET AND PLACED IT DOWN ON THE MOIST DIRT
6674-71396-0003 THEN HE TOOK ANOTHER OBJECT FROM HIS POCKET AND REPEATED THE OPERATION CAN THEY BE SHOES HE HAS IN HIS HANDS MUSED THE DETECTIVE AND IF THEY ARE WHAT IS HE DOING WITH THEM
6674-71396-0004 HEARING THE SLAMMING OF A DOOR AT THE MANSION ADAM ADAMS DREW STILL FURTHER BACK AMONG THE BUSHES A MINUTE LATER HE SAW THE MAN MAKE A LONG LEAP CLEAR THE BROOK AND HURRY AWAY AMONG THE TREES AND BRUSHWOOD ON THE OTHER SIDE
6674-71396-0005 HUMPH PERHAPS THIS IS WORTH INVESTIGATING MUSED THE DETECTIVE AND MADE HIS WAY TO THE SPOT THE STRANGE INDIVIDUAL HAD OCCUPIED ON THE BANK OF THE BROOK HE SAW THE MARKS OF THE MAN'S BROAD SHOES
6674-71396-0006 AND ALSO SOME PRINTS MADE BY SMALLER SHOES THE LATTER PRINTS WERE IRREGULAR AND AT ONCE ARRESTED THE DETECTIVE'S ATTENTION HE SMILED GRIMLY TO HIMSELF CLUE NUMBER ONE HE MUTTERED ADAM ADAMS LOOKED AROUND IN THE WATER
6674-71396-0007 SOON HE CAME UPON THE STRIP OF WHITE AND PULLING ON IT BROUGHT TO LIGHT A WHITE SILK SHIRTWAIST TORN TO RIBBONS IN FRONT AND AT ONE SLEEVE HE WRUNG THE WATER AND MUD FROM THE GARMENT AND EXAMINED IT
6674-71396-0008 INSIDE OF THE COLLAR BAND WERE THE INITIALS M A L MARGARET A LANGMORE HE MURMURED THOSE INITIALS ARE HERS IF THE SHIRTWAIST WAS HERS HOW DID THAT FELLOW GET POSSESSION OF IT AND DID HE PLACE IT HERE OR FIND IT HERE
6674-71396-0009 DRYING THE GARMENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE HE PLACED IT IN HIS POCKET AND CONTINUED HIS SEARCH AROUND THE VICINITY HE SPENT FULLY AN HOUR IN THE LOCALITY AND THEN WALKED BACK THE WAY HE HAD COME AND INTO THE MANSION
6674-71396-0010 THERE HE FOUND THOMAS OSTRELLO IN CONVERSATION WITH THE POLICEMAN IT IS A TERRIBLE BLOW TO ME THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELER WAS SAYING
6674-71396-0011 IF I HAD REMAINED HERE OVER NIGHT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE OCCURRED AT ALL WELL THAT'S THE WAY THINGS HAPPEN ANSWERED THE POLICEMAN ONCE I WAS AT ONE END OF MY BEAT WHEN A THIEF BROKE INTO A STORE AT THE OTHER END AND STOLE SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND TWO HAMS
6674-71396-0012 AND I SUPPOSE THEY BLAMED YOU FOR IT SURE THEY DID I WAS LAID OFF FOR A WEEK WITHOUT PAY IF ANYTHING HAPPENS IT IS ALWAYS THE POOR COPPER WHO IS TO BLAME WELL THE FAMILY ARE NOT BLAMING YOU FOR THIS THEY CAN'T
6674-71396-0013 ESPECIALLY AS THEY'VE GOT THE PERSON WHO DID THE DEED AT THIS THOMAS OSTRELLO SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YOU DON'T NO I'D HATE TO BELIEVE ANY GIRL COULD DO SUCH A FEARFUL THING AS THIS THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELER PAUSED
6674-71396-0014 I'M GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL RIGHT CERTAINLY MISTER OSTRELLO ANSWERED THE POLICEMAN AND THEN THE COMMERCIAL MAN STEPPED INTO THE LIBRARY CLOSING THE DOOR AFTER HIM ADAM ADAMS HAD PASSED INTO THE DINING ROOM JUST BACK OF THE LIBRARY
6674-71396-0015 BUT HAD HEARD WHAT WAS SAID NOW LOOKING THROUGH THE DOORWAY WHICH HAD A SLIDING DOOR AND A HEAVY CURTAIN THE LATTER PARTLY DRAWN HE SAW THE MAN GLANCE AROUND HURRIEDLY MOVING FROM ONE OBJECT TO ANOTHER IN THE LIBRARY
6674-71396-0016 AND EVEN INTO THE VARIOUS BOOKCASES
6674-71396-0017 AND TRIED THE KNOB OF THE COMBINATION HALF A DOZEN TIMES HE IS MORE THAN ORDINARILY INTERESTED REASONED THE DETECTIVE BUT THEN IT WAS HIS OWN MOTHER WHO WAS MURDERED
6674-71396-0018 THE COMMERCIAL MAN CONTINUED HIS SEARCH UNTIL HE HAD COVERED EVERY OBJECT IN THE ROOM SEVERAL TIMES HE EVEN LOOKED BEHIND THE PICTURES AND INTO THE DRAWER OF THE TABLE SOMETHING WHICH HAD ESCAPED THE CORONER'S EYE WHEN SEALING UP THE DESK
6674-71396-0019 ADAM ADAMS SAW HIM SHAKE HIS HEAD IN DESPAIR HE TOOK A TURN UP AND DOWN THE APARTMENT AND CLENCHED HIS HANDS NERVOUSLY GONE HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF WHAT COULD HAVE BECOME OF IT
6674-71396-0020 HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A NOTEBOOK HE CARRIED AND STUDIED SEVERAL ITEMS CAREFULLY A LONG SIGH ESCAPED FROM HIS LIPS AS HE RESTORED THE NOTEBOOK TO HIS POCKET
6674-71396-0021 AS THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELER MOVED TOWARD THE DINING ROOM THE DETECTIVE STEPPED INTO A SIDE APARTMENT USED IN THE WINTER AS A CONSERVATORY HE SAW THOMAS OSTRELLO MAKE AN EXAMINATION OF SEVERAL PLACES INCLUDING A SIDEBOARD
6674-71396-0022 THEN THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN PLACED IN CHARGE OF THE DOWNSTAIRS PORTION OF THE MANSION ENTERED WON'T YOU HAVE A BITE TO EAT MISTER OSTRELLO SHE ASKED PERHAPS SO LATER ON I DO NOT FEEL LIKE EATING NOW CAN I TAKE A LOOK AT MY MOTHER'S ROOM
6674-71396-0023 WHY YES I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS CERTAINLY I OFTEN VISITED HER THERE WHEN SHE WAS NOT FEELING WELL HE PASSED OUT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND WAS SOON MOUNTING THE HEAVILY CARPETED STAIRS ONCE IN THE ROOM HE CLOSED THE DOOR TIGHTLY
6674-71396-0024 COMING UP SOFTLY AFTER HIM ADAM ADAMS TRIED THE DOOR AND FOUND IT LOCKED MORE INTERESTED THAN EVER THE DETECTIVE JUST AVOIDING MISSUS MORSE WHO WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HALLWAY SLIPPED INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM AND FINDING AS HE HAD IMAGINED
6674-71396-0025 A DOOR BETWEEN THE TWO APPLIED HIS EYE TO THE KEYHOLE THIS MIGHT MEAN NOTHING AND IT MIGHT MEAN EVERYTHING HE SAW MISSUS LANGMORE'S SON MOVING AROUND THE DRESSING ROOM PRECISELY AS HE HAD MOVED AROUND THE LIBRARY
6674-71396-0026 HE HEARD THE BUREAU DRAWERS OPENED AND SHUT AND THEN HEARD THE SQUEAK OF A SMALL WRITING DESK THAT STOOD IN A CORNER AS THE LEAF WAS TURNED DOWN THEN CAME A RATTLE OF PAPERS AND A SUDDEN SUBDUED EXCLAMATION
6674-71396-0027 THE DESK WAS CLOSED AGAIN AND THE MAN CAME OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE HALL DOOR PARTLY OPEN WHATEVER HE WAS LOOKING FOR HE MUST HAVE FOUND IT REASONED THE DETECTIVE NOW WHAT WAS IT
6674-71396-0028 HE WAITED IN THE HALLWAY AND HEARD THOMAS OSTRELLO ENTER THE DINING ROOM A MINUTE LATER CAME THE RATTLE OF DISHES THEN MISSUS MORSE CONFRONTED HIM BACK AGAIN I SEE SHE SAID RATHER SHARPLY
6674-71396-0029 YES I WISH TO HAVE ANOTHER TALK WITH MISS LANGMORE HE RETURNED AND BRUSHING HER ASIDE KNOCKED ON THE GIRL'S DOOR AND WAS ADMITTED THE WOMAN PURSED UP HER LIPS HOW VERY IMPORTANT SOME OF THOSE CITY LAWYERS ARE SHE MUTTERED

6674-71396-0037 WAS HIS MENTAL CONCLUSION I THINK HER INNOCENT BUT THE BEST OF US GET TRIPPED UP AT TIMES IF SHE IS INNOCENT THAT EVIDENCE WAS MANUFACTURED TO PROVE HER GUILTY
6674-71396-0038 I MIGHT HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING WORTH KNOWING NOTHING ELSE SEEMS TO BE MISSING ANNOUNCED THE GIRL AT LENGTH VERY WELL THEN DON'T WASTE TIME BY SEARCHING FURTHER BY THE WAY DID YOU KNOW MISTER THOMAS OSTRELLO HAD ARRIVED
