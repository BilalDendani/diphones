1422-146111-0000 CHAPTER FIVE GEORGE AWOKE NEXT MORNING WITH A MISTY SENSE THAT SOMEHOW THE WORLD HAD CHANGED AS THE LAST REMNANTS OF SLEEP LEFT HIM HE WAS AWARE OF A VAGUE EXCITEMENT THEN HE SAT UP IN BED WITH A JERK
1422-146111-0001 HE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS IN LOVE THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT A CURIOUS HAPPINESS PERVADED HIS ENTIRE BEING HE FELT YOUNG AND ACTIVE EVERYTHING WAS EMPHATICALLY FOR THE BEST IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
1422-146111-0002 HE BEAMED AT HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR IT HAD COME AT LAST THE REAL THING GEORGE HAD NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE NOT REALLY IN LOVE
1422-146111-0003 AND WITH DOZENS WHOM HE HAD ONLY SEEN IN THE DISTANCE BUT RIPENING YEARS HAD MELLOWED HIS TASTE AND ROBBED HIM OF THAT FINE ROMANTIC CATHOLICITY DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS WOMEN HAD FOUND HIM MORE OR LESS COLD
1422-146111-0004 IT WAS THE NATURE OF HIS PROFESSION THAT HAD LARGELY BROUGHT ABOUT THIS COOLING OF THE EMOTIONS TO A MAN WHO LIKE GEORGE HAS WORKED YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT AT THE COMPOSITION OF MUSICAL COMEDIES WOMAN
1422-146111-0005 COMES TO LOSE MANY OF THOSE ATTRACTIVE QUALITIES WHICH ENSNARE THE ORDINARY MALE TO GEORGE OF LATE YEARS
1422-146111-0006 AS A SEX WAS HER DISPOSITION TO KICK FOR FIVE YEARS HE HAD BEEN WANDERING IN A WORLD OF WOMEN MANY OF THEM BEAUTIFUL ALL OF THEM SUPERFICIALLY ATTRACTIVE
1422-146111-0007 SOME HAD KICKED ABOUT THEIR MUSICAL NUMBERS SOME ABOUT THEIR LOVE SCENES SOME HAD GRUMBLED ABOUT THEIR EXIT LINES OTHERS ABOUT THE LINES OF THEIR SECOND ACT FROCKS THEY HAD KICKED IN A MYRIAD DIFFERING WAYS
1422-146111-0008 AS SOMETHING TO BE DODGED TACTFULLY IF POSSIBLE BUT IF NOT POSSIBLE BY OPEN FLIGHT FOR YEARS HE HAD DREADED TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH A WOMAN AND HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF GLIDING SWIFTLY AWAY
1422-146111-0009 WHEN HE SAW ONE BEARING DOWN ON HIM THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF SUCH A STATE OF THINGS IS NOT DIFFICULT TO REALIZE TAKE A MAN OF NATURALLY QUIXOTIC TEMPERAMENT A MAN OF CHIVALROUS INSTINCTS AND A FEELING FOR ROMANCE
1422-146111-0010 AND CUT HIM OFF FOR FIVE YEARS FROM THE EXERCISE OF THOSE QUALITIES AND YOU GET AN ACCUMULATED STORE OF FOOLISHNESS ONLY COMPARABLE TO AN ESCAPE OF GAS IN A SEALED ROOM OR A CELLARFUL OF DYNAMITE A FLICKER OF A MATCH
1422-146111-0011 UP IN THE AIR IN A MILLION PIECES HAD GONE THE PRUDENCE AND SELF RESTRAINT OF A LIFETIME AND HERE HE WAS AS DESPERATELY IN LOVE AS ANY TROUBADOUR OF THE MIDDLE AGES
1422-146111-0012 IT WAS NOT TILL HE HAD FINISHED SHAVING AND WAS TESTING THE TEMPERATURE OF HIS BATH WITH A SHRINKING TOE THAT THE REALIZATION CAME OVER HIM IN A WAVE THAT
1422-146111-0013 EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HIS OPTIMISM GEORGE COULD NOT DENY THAT THESE FACTS MIGHT REASONABLY BE CONSIDERED IN THE NATURE OF OBSTACLES HE WENT BACK INTO HIS BEDROOM
1422-146111-0014 THIS THING WANTED THINKING OVER HE WAS NOT DEPRESSED ONLY A LITTLE THOUGHTFUL HIS FAITH IN HIS LUCK SUSTAINED HIM HE WAS HE REALIZED
1422-146111-0015 IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS MADE A SUPREME DRIVE FROM THE TEE AND FINDS HIS BALL NEAR THE GREEN BUT IN A CUPPY LIE HE HAD GAINED MUCH IT NOW REMAINED FOR HIM TO PUSH HIS SUCCESS TO THE HAPPY CONCLUSION
1422-146111-0016 WOULD STAMP HIM A FEEBLE ADVENTURER A FELLOW COULD NOT EXPECT LUCK TO DO EVERYTHING FOR HIM HE MUST SUPPLEMENT ITS ASSISTANCE WITH HIS OWN EFFORTS WHAT HAD HE TO GO ON WELL NOTHING MUCH
1422-146111-0017 IF IT CAME TO THAT EXCEPT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE LIVED SOME TWO HOURS BY TRAIN OUT OF LONDON AND THAT HER JOURNEY STARTED FROM WATERLOO STATION WHAT WOULD SHERLOCK HOLMES HAVE DONE CONCENTRATED THOUGHT SUPPLIED NO ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
1422-146111-0018 AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT THE CHEERY OPTIMISM WITH WHICH HE HAD BEGUN THE DAY LEFT GEORGE AND GAVE PLACE TO A GREY GLOOM A DREADFUL PHRASE
1422-146111-0019 GEORGE COULD NOT SEE HOW IT COULD POSSIBLY TURN OUT ANY OTHER WAY HE DRESSED MOODILY AND LEFT THE ROOM TO GO DOWN TO BREAKFAST BREAKFAST WOULD AT LEAST ALLEVIATE THIS SINKING FEELING WHICH WAS UNMANNING HIM
1422-146111-0020 AND HE COULD THINK MORE BRISKLY AFTER A CUP OR TWO OF COFFEE HE OPENED THE DOOR ON A MAT OUTSIDE LAY A LETTER THE HANDWRITING WAS FEMININE IT WAS ALSO IN PENCIL AND STRANGE TO HIM HE OPENED THE ENVELOPE
1422-146111-0021 DEAR MISTER BEVAN IT BEGAN WITH A SUDDEN LEAP OF THE HEART HE LOOKED AT THE SIGNATURE THE LETTER WAS SIGNED THE GIRL IN THE CAB
1422-146111-0022 FOR I REMEMBERED THAT I WAS WEARING A NICE BROOCH AND STOPPED ON THE WAY TO THE STATION TO PAWN IT THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR WONDERFUL KINDNESS YOURS THE GIRL IN THE CAB GEORGE READ THE NOTE TWICE ON THE WAY DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
1422-146111-0023 AND THREE TIMES MORE DURING THE MEAL THEN HAVING COMMITTED ITS CONTENTS TO MEMORY DOWN TO THE LAST COMMA HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO GLOWING THOUGHTS WHAT A GIRL HE HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE BEFORE MET A WOMAN WHO COULD WRITE A LETTER WITHOUT A POSTSCRIPT
1422-146111-0024 THE RESOURCE OF HER TO THINK OF PAWNING THAT BROOCH THE SWEETNESS OF HER TO BOTHER TO SEND HIM A NOTE MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WAS HE CONVINCED THAT HE HAD MET HIS IDEAL AND MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WAS HE DETERMINED
1422-146111-0025 IT NARROWED THE THING DOWN ABSURDLY THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT THREE COUNTIES IN WHICH SHE COULD POSSIBLY LIVE AND A MAN MUST BE A POOR FELLOW WHO IS INCAPABLE OF SEARCHING THROUGH A FEW SMALL COUNTIES FOR THE GIRL HE LOVES ESPECIALLY A MAN WITH LUCK LIKE HIS
1422-146111-0026 LUCK IS A GODDESS NOT TO BE COERCED AND FORCIBLY WOOED BY THOSE WHO SEEK HER FAVOURS FROM SUCH MASTERFUL SPIRITS SHE TURNS AWAY BUT IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES THAT
1422-146111-0027 IF WE PUT OUR HAND IN HERS WITH THE HUMBLE TRUST OF A LITTLE CHILD SHE WILL HAVE PITY ON US AND NOT FAIL US IN OUR HOUR OF NEED ON GEORGE HOPEFULLY WATCHING FOR SOMETHING TO TURN UP SHE SMILED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
1422-146111-0028 IT WAS GEORGE'S PRACTICE WHEN HE LUNCHED ALONE TO RELIEVE THE TEDIUM OF THE MEAL WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF READING MATTER IN THE SHAPE OF ONE OR MORE OF THE EVENING PAPERS TODAY SITTING DOWN TO A SOLITARY REPAST AT THE PICCADILLY GRILL ROOM
