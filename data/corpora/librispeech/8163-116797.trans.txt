8163-116797-0000 THE PARADISE OF CHILDREN LONG LONG AGO WHEN THIS OLD WORLD WAS IN ITS TENDER INFANCY THERE WAS A CHILD NAMED EPIMETHEUS WHO NEVER HAD EITHER FATHER OR MOTHER AND
8163-116797-0001 THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE LONELY ANOTHER CHILD FATHERLESS AND MOTHERLESS LIKE HIMSELF WAS SENT FROM A FAR COUNTRY TO LIVE WITH HIM AND BE HIS PLAYFELLOW AND HELPMATE HER NAME WAS PANDORA
8163-116797-0002 THE FIRST THING THAT PANDORA SAW WHEN SHE ENTERED THE COTTAGE WHERE EPIMETHEUS DWELT WAS A GREAT BOX AND ALMOST THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH SHE PUT TO HIM AFTER CROSSING THE THRESHOLD WAS THIS EPIMETHEUS
8163-116797-0003 BUT WHO GAVE IT TO YOU ASKED PANDORA AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM
8163-116797-0004 AND THE WORLD NOWADAYS IS A VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF THING FROM WHAT IT WAS IN THEIR TIME THEN EVERYBODY WAS A CHILD THERE NEEDED NO FATHERS AND MOTHERS TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DANGER NOR TROUBLE OF ANY KIND AND NO CLOTHES TO BE MENDED
8163-116797-0005 AND THERE WAS ALWAYS PLENTY TO EAT AND DRINK WHENEVER A CHILD WANTED HIS DINNER HE FOUND IT GROWING ON A TREE AND IF HE LOOKED AT THE TREE IN THE MORNING HE COULD SEE THE EXPANDING BLOSSOM OF THAT NIGHT'S SUPPER
8163-116797-0006 OR AT EVENTIDE HE SAW THE TENDER BUD OF TO MORROW'S BREAKFAST IT WAS A VERY PLEASANT LIFE INDEED NO LABOUR TO BE DONE NO TASKS TO BE STUDIED
8163-116797-0007 WHAT WAS MOST WONDERFUL OF ALL THE CHILDREN NEVER QUARRELLED AMONG THEMSELVES NEITHER HAD THEY ANY CRYING FITS NOR SINCE TIME FIRST BEGAN HAD A SINGLE ONE OF THESE LITTLE MORTALS EVER GONE APART INTO A CORNER AND SULKED
8163-116797-0008 THE TRUTH IS THOSE UGLY LITTLE WINGED MONSTERS CALLED TROUBLES WHICH ARE NOW ALMOST AS NUMEROUS AS MOSQUITOES HAD NEVER YET BEEN SEEN ON THE EARTH
8163-116797-0009 BUT EVERY DAY IT GREW MORE AND MORE SUBSTANTIAL UNTIL BEFORE A GREAT WHILE THE COTTAGE OF EPIMETHEUS AND PANDORA WAS LESS SUNSHINY THAN THOSE OF THE OTHER CHILDREN
8163-116797-0010 WHENCE CAN THE BOX HAVE COME PANDORA CONTINUALLY KEPT SAYING TO HERSELF AND TO EPIMETHEUS AND WHAT IN THE WORLD CAN BE INSIDE OF IT
8163-116797-0011 I WISH DEAR PANDORA YOU WOULD TRY TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE COME LET US GO AND GATHER SOME RIPE FIGS AND EAT THEM UNDER THE TREES FOR OUR SUPPER
8163-116797-0012 ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT GRAPES AND FIGS CRIED PANDORA PETTISHLY
8163-116797-0013 LET US RUN OUT AND HAVE A MERRY TIME WITH OUR PLAYMATES
8163-116797-0014 AND BESIDES I NEVER DO HAVE ANY THIS UGLY BOX I AM SO TAKEN UP WITH THINKING ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME I INSIST UPON YOUR TELLING ME WHAT IS INSIDE OF IT
8163-116797-0015 AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID FIFTY TIMES OVER I DO NOT KNOW REPLIED EPIMETHEUS GETTING A LITTLE VEXED HOW THEN CAN I TELL YOU WHAT IS INSIDE YOU MIGHT OPEN IT SAID PANDORA LOOKING SIDEWAYS AT EPIMETHEUS AND THEN WE COULD SEE FOR OURSELVES
8163-116797-0016 PANDORA WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF EXCLAIMED EPIMETHEUS AND HIS FACE EXPRESSED SO MUCH HORROR AT THE IDEA OF LOOKING INTO A BOX WHICH HAD BEEN CONFIDED TO HIM ON THE CONDITION OF HIS NEVER OPENING IT THAT PANDORA THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO SUGGEST IT ANY MORE
8163-116797-0017 STILL HOWEVER SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING AND TALKING ABOUT THE BOX
8163-116797-0018 IT WAS LEFT AT THE DOOR REPLIED EPIMETHEUS JUST BEFORE YOU CAME BY A PERSON WHO LOOKED VERY SMILING AND INTELLIGENT AND WHO COULD HARDLY FORBEAR LAUGHING AS HE PUT IT DOWN
8163-116797-0019 OH THE MOST CURIOUS STAFF YOU EVER SAW CRIED EPIMETHEUS IT WAS LIKE TWO SERPENTS TWISTING AROUND A STICK AND WAS CARVED SO NATURALLY THAT I AT FIRST THOUGHT THE SERPENTS WERE ALIVE I KNOW HIM SAID PANDORA THOUGHTFULLY
8163-116797-0020 NOBODY ELSE HAS SUCH A STAFF IT WAS QUICKSILVER AND HE BROUGHT ME HITHER AS WELL AS THE BOX NO DOUBT HE INTENDED IT FOR ME AND MOST PROBABLY IT CONTAINS PRETTY DRESSES FOR ME TO WEAR OR TOYS FOR YOU AND ME TO PLAY WITH
8163-116797-0021 PERHAPS SO ANSWERED EPIMETHEUS TURNING AWAY BUT UNTIL QUICKSILVER COMES BACK AND TELLS US SO WE HAVE NEITHER OF US ANY RIGHT TO LIFT THE LID OF THE BOX
8163-116797-0022 HE WENT TO GATHER FIGS AND GRAPES BY HIMSELF OR TO SEEK WHATEVER AMUSEMENT HE COULD FIND IN OTHER SOCIETY THAN HIS LITTLE PLAYFELLOW'S HE WAS TIRED TO DEATH OF HEARING ABOUT THE BOX AND HEARTILY WISHED THAT QUICKSILVER OR WHATEVER WAS THE MESSENGER'S NAME
8163-116797-0023 HAD LEFT IT AT SOME OTHER CHILD'S DOOR WHERE PANDORA WOULD NEVER HAVE SET EYES ON IT
8163-116797-0024 THE BOX THE BOX AND NOTHING BUT THE BOX IT SEEMED AS IF THE BOX WERE BEWITCHED AND AS IF THE COTTAGE WERE NOT BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD IT WITHOUT PANDORA'S CONTINUALLY STUMBLING OVER IT AND MAKING EPIMETHEUS STUMBLE OVER IT LIKEWISE AND BRUISING ALL FOUR OF THEIR SHINS
8163-116797-0025 WELL IT WAS REALLY HARD THAT POOR EPIMETHEUS SHOULD HAVE A BOX IN HIS EARS FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT ESPECIALLY AS THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH WERE SO UNACCUSTOMED TO VEXATIONS
8163-116797-0026 THUS A SMALL VEXATION MADE AS MUCH DISTURBANCE THEN AS A FAR BIGGER ONE WOULD IN OUR OWN TIMES
8163-116797-0027 PANDORA STOOD GAZING AT THE BOX SHE HAD CALLED IT UGLY ABOVE A HUNDRED TIMES BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THAT SHE HAD SAID AGAINST IT IT WAS POSITIVELY A VERY HANDSOME ARTICLE OF FURNITURE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AN ORNAMENT TO ANY ROOM IN WHICH IT SHOULD BE PLACED
8163-116797-0028 IT WAS MADE OF A BEAUTIFUL KIND OF WOOD WITH DARK AND RICH VEINS SPREADING OVER ITS SURFACE WHICH WAS SO HIGHLY POLISHED THAT LITTLE PANDORA COULD SEE HER FACE IN IT
8163-116797-0029 AND THE PRETTIEST CHILDREN EVER SEEN RECLINING OR SPORTING AMID A PROFUSION OF FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE
8163-116797-0030 AND THESE VARIOUS OBJECTS WERE SO EXQUISITELY REPRESENTED AND WERE WROUGHT TOGETHER IN SUCH HARMONY THAT FLOWERS FOLIAGE AND HUMAN BEINGS SEEMED TO COMBINE INTO A WREATH OF MINGLED BEAUTY BUT HERE AND THERE PEEPING FORTH FROM BEHIND THE CARVED FOLIAGE
8163-116797-0031 PANDORA ONCE OR TWICE FANCIED THAT SHE SAW A FACE NOT SO LOVELY OR SOMETHING OR OTHER THAT WAS DISAGREEABLE AND WHICH STOLE THE BEAUTY OUT OF ALL THE REST NEVERTHELESS ON LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AND TOUCHING THE SPOT WITH HER FINGER
8163-116797-0032 ALL WORE A VERY LIVELY AND RATHER MISCHIEVOUS EXPRESSION WHICH LOOKED ALMOST AS IF IT NEEDS MUST BURST OUT OF THE CARVED LIPS AND UTTER ITSELF IN WORDS HAD THE MOUTH SPOKEN IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS
8163-116797-0033 DO NOT BE AFRAID PANDORA WHAT HARM CAN THERE BE IN OPENING THE BOX
8163-116797-0034 NEVER WAS A KNOT SO CUNNINGLY TWISTED NOR WITH SO MANY INS AND OUTS WHICH ROGUISHLY DEFIED THE SKILFULLEST FINGERS TO DISENTANGLE THEM AND YET BY THE VERY DIFFICULTY THAT THERE WAS IN IT PANDORA WAS THE MORE TEMPTED TO EXAMINE THE KNOT
8163-116797-0035 TWO OR THREE TIMES ALREADY SHE HAD STOOPED OVER THE BOX AND TAKEN THE KNOT BETWEEN HER THUMB AND FOREFINGER BUT WITHOUT POSITIVELY TRYING TO UNDO IT
8163-116797-0036 NAY PERHAPS I COULD TIE IT UP AGAIN AFTER UNDOING IT THERE WOULD BE NO HARM IN THAT SURELY EVEN EPIMETHEUS WOULD NOT BLAME ME FOR THAT I NEED NOT OPEN THE BOX AND SHOULD NOT OF COURSE WITHOUT THE FOOLISH BOY'S CONSENT EVEN IF THE KNOT WERE UNTIED
8163-116797-0037 GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH LEISURE THEY COULD NOT BE FOREVER PLAYING AT HIDE AND SEEK AMONG THE FLOWER SHRUBS OR AT BLIND MAN'S BUFF WITH GARLANDS OVER THEIR EYES OR AT WHATEVER OTHER GAMES HAD BEEN FOUND OUT WHILE MOTHER EARTH WAS IN HER BABYHOOD
8163-116797-0038 WHEN LIFE IS ALL SPORT TOIL IS THE REAL PLAY THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO A LITTLE SWEEPING AND DUSTING ABOUT THE COTTAGE I SUPPOSE AND THE GATHERING OF FRESH FLOWERS WHICH WERE ONLY TOO ABUNDANT EVERYWHERE
8163-116797-0039 AND ARRANGING THEM IN VASES AND POOR LITTLE PANDORA'S DAY'S WORK WAS OVER AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE DAY THERE WAS THE BOX AFTER ALL I AM NOT QUITE SURE THAT THE BOX WAS NOT A BLESSING TO HER IN ITS WAY
8163-116797-0040 IT SUPPLIED HER WITH SUCH A VARIETY OF IDEAS TO THINK OF AND TO TALK ABOUT WHENEVER SHE HAD ANYBODY TO LISTEN
