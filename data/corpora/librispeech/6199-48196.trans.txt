6199-48196-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE FIRST WEDDING IN SPITE HOWEVER OF NORMAN AND HIS ANGER ON A COLD SNOWY MORNING IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY GERTRUDE STOOD AT THE ALTAR IN HAMPTON CHURCH A HAPPY TRUSTING BRIDE
6199-48196-0001 AND LINDA STOOD SMILING BEHIND HER THE LOVELY LEADER OF THE NUPTIAL TRAIN NOR WERE LINDA'S SMILES FALSE OR FORCED MUCH LESS TREACHEROUS SHE HAD TAUGHT HERSELF TO LOOK ON ALARIC AS HER SISTER'S HUSBAND
6199-48196-0002 AND THOUGH IN DOING SO SHE HAD SUFFERED AND DID STILL SUFFER SHE NOW THOUGHT OF HER OWN LOST LOVER IN NO OTHER GUISE
6199-48196-0003 TO HER MISTRESS OH MA'AM WHY SUSAN WHAT AILS YOU OH MA'AM WELL SUSAN WHAT IS IT WHY ARE YOU CRYING OH MA'AM JOHN
6199-48196-0004 INDEED MA'AM HE IS THEN THE WORST OF MISBEHAVIOUR FOR HE'S GONE AND GOT HISSELF MARRIED AND POOR SUSAN GAVE VENT TO A FLOOD OF TEARS HER MISTRESS TRIED TO COMFORT HER AND NOT IN VAIN
6199-48196-0005 SHE TOLD HER THAT PROBABLY SHE MIGHT BE BETTER AS SHE WAS THAT JOHN SEEING WHAT HE HAD DONE MUST BE A FALSE CREATURE WHO WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE USED HER ILL AND SHE ENDED HER GOOD COUNSEL BY TRYING TO MAKE SUSAN UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE STILL AS GOOD FISH IN THE SEA
6199-48196-0006 IT'S THE LOOKS ON IT MA'AM IT'S THAT I MIND HOW MANY OF US ARE THERE WOMEN AND MEN TOO WHO THINK MOST OF THE LOOKS OF IT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHO WERE WE AS HONEST AS POOR SUSAN
6199-48196-0007 OUGHT TO THANK GOD AS SHE DID THAT WE CAN LOVE ANYONE ANYONE THAT IS OF THE OTHER SEX WE ARE NOT ALL OF US SUSCEPTIBLE OF BEING TORN TO TATTERS BY AN UNHAPPY PASSION NOT EVEN ALL THOSE OF US WHO MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE
6199-48196-0008 OF A TRUE AND HONEST LOVE AND IT IS WELL THAT IT IS SO IT IS ONE OF GOD'S MERCIES AND IF WE WERE AS WISE AS SUSAN WE SHOULD THANK GOD FOR IT LINDA WAS PERHAPS ONE OF THOSE
6199-48196-0009 SHE WAS GOOD AFFECTIONATE TENDER AND TRUE BUT SHE WAS MADE OF THAT STUFF WHICH CAN BEND TO THE NORTH WIND THE WORLD WAS NOT ALL OVER WITH HER BECAUSE A MAN HAD BEEN UNTRUE TO HER SHE HAD HAD HER GRIEF
6199-48196-0010 AND HONESTLY WISHED THEM HAPPINESS AND KATIE WAS THERE VERY PRETTY AND BONNY STILL CHILDISH WITH HER SHORT DRESS AND LONG TROUSERS BUT LOOKING AS THOUGH SHE TOO WOULD SOON FEEL THE STRENGTH OF HER OWN WINGS AND BE ABLE TO FLY AWAY
6199-48196-0011 FROM HER MOTHER'S NEST DEAR KATIE HER STORY HAS YET TO BE TOLD TO HER BELONGS NEITHER THE SOFT EASINESS OF HER SISTER LINDA NOR THE STERNER DIGNITY OF GERTRUDE BUT SHE HAS A CHARACTER OF HER OWN WHICH CONTAINS PERHAPS
6199-48196-0012 HIGHER QUALITIES THAN THOSE GIVEN TO EITHER OF HER SISTERS AND THERE WERE OTHER BRIDESMAIDS THERE HOW MANY IT BOOTS NOT NOW TO SAY WE MUST HAVE THE SPACES ROUND OUR ALTARS GREATLY WIDENED IF THIS PASSION FOR BEVIES
6199-48196-0013 OF ATTENDANT NYMPHS BE ALLOWED TO GO ON INCREASING AND IF CRINOLINES INCREASE ALSO IF EVERY BRIDE IS TO HAVE TWELVE MAIDENS AND EACH MAIDEN TO STAND ON NO LESS THAN A TWELVE YARD CIRCLE WHAT MODEST TEMPLE WILL EVER SUFFICE
6199-48196-0014 FOR A SACRIFICE TO HYMEN AND MISSUS WOODWARD WAS THERE OF COURSE AS PRETTY TO MY THINKING AS EITHER OF HER DAUGHTERS OR ANY OF THE BRIDESMAIDS SHE WAS VERY PRETTY AND SMILING AND QUIET BUT WHEN GERTRUDE SAID
6199-48196-0015 I WILL SHE WAS THINKING OF HARRY NORMAN AND GRIEVING THAT HE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN CUTTWATER WAS THERE RADIANT IN A NEW BLUE COAT MADE SPECIALLY FOR THE OCCASION AND ELASTIC WITH TRUE JOY HE HAD BEEN VERY GENEROUS
6199-48196-0016 ON GERTRUDE PAYABLE OF COURSE AFTER HIS DEATH THIS INDEED WAS THE BULK OF WHAT HE HAD TO GIVE AND MISSUS WOODWARD HAD SEEN WITH REGRET HIS EXUBERANT MUNIFICENCE TO ONE OF HER CHILDREN BUT GERTRUDE WAS HER CHILD AND OF COURSE
6199-48196-0017 SHE COULD NOT COMPLAIN AND CHARLEY WAS THERE ACTING AS BEST MAN IT WAS JUST THE PLACE AND JUST THE WORK FOR CHARLEY HE FORGOT ALL HIS DIFFICULTIES ALL HIS DUNS AND ALSO ALL HIS TOWN DELIGHTS
6199-48196-0018 WITHOUT A SIGH HE LEFT HIS LADY IN NORFOLK STREET TO MIX GIN SLING FOR OTHER ADMIRERS AND FELT NO REGRET THOUGH FOUR BROTHER NAVVIES WERE GOING TO MAKE A STUNNING NIGHT OF IT AT THE SALON DE SEVILLE
6199-48196-0019 AT THE BOTTOM OF HOLBORN HILL HOWEVER HE HAD HIS HOPES THAT HE MIGHT BE BACK IN TIME FOR SOME OF THAT FUN AND UNDY SCOTT WAS THERE
6199-48196-0020 AS A MATTER OF COURSE ASKED HIM TO HIS WEDDING AND MISSUS WOODWARD HAD OF COURSE EXPRESSED HER DELIGHT AT RECEIVING ALARIC'S FRIEND
6199-48196-0021 BEING NO WHIT ABASHED IN HIS ATTENDANCE ON THEM BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS BOSOM'S MISTRESS WHOM HE HAD LEFT LET US HOPE HAPPY IN HER FAR DOMESTIC RETIREMENT UNDY SCOTT WAS A GOOD MAN AT A WEDDING AND MADE HIMSELF SPECIALLY AGREEABLE ON THIS OCCASION
6199-48196-0022 BUT THE GREAT GLORY OF THE DAY WAS THE PRESENCE OF SIR GREGORY HARDLINES IT WAS A HIGH HONOUR CONSIDERING ALL THAT RESTED ON SIR GREGORY'S SHOULDERS FOR SO GREAT A MAN TO COME ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HAMPTON TO SEE A CLERK
6199-48196-0023 IN THE WEIGHTS AND MEASURES MARRIED CUM TOT SUSTINEAS ET TANTA NEGOTIA SOLUS FOR WE MAY CALL IT SOLUS SIR WARWICK AND MISTER JOBBLES BEING SOURCES OF MORE PLAGUE THAN PROFIT
6199-48196-0024 IN CARRYING OUT YOUR NOBLE SCHEMES WHILE SO MANY THINGS ARE ON YOUR SHOULDERS SIR GREGORY WHILE YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CIVIL SERVICE BY YOUR PEN ADORNING IT BY YOUR CONDUCT PERFECTING IT BY NEW RULES HOW COULD ANY MAN
6199-48196-0025 HAVE HAD THE FACE TO ASK YOU TO A WEDDING NEVERTHELESS SIR GREGORY WAS THERE AND DID NOT LOSE THE EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY WHICH A SPEECH AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AFFORDED HIM FOR EXPRESSING HIS OPINION ON THE CIVIL SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY
6199-48196-0026 AND SO GERTRUDE WOODWARD BECAME GERTRUDE TUDOR AND SHE AND ALARIC WERE WHIRLED AWAY BY A POST CHAISE AND POST BOY DONE OUT WITH WHITE BOWS TO THE HAMPTON COURT STATION FROM THENCE THEY WHISKED UP TO LONDON
6199-48196-0027 AND THEN DOWN TO DOVER AND THERE WE WILL LEAVE THEM THEY WERE WHISKED AWAY HAVING FIRST DULY GONE THROUGH THE AMOUNT OF BADGERING WHICH THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM HAVE TO SUFFER AT THE WEDDING BREAKFAST TABLE
6199-48196-0028 THEY DRANK THEIR OWN HEALTH IN CHAMPAGNE ALARIC MADE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE SAID HE WAS QUITE UNWORTHY OF HIS PRESENT HAPPINESS AND GERTRUDE PICKED UP ALL THE BIJOUX GOLD PENCIL CASES AND SILVER CREAM JUGS
6199-48196-0029 WHICH WERE THROWN AT HER FROM ALL SIDES ALL THE MEN MADE SPEECHES AND ALL THE WOMEN LAUGHED BUT THE SPEECH OF THE DAY WAS THAT CELEBRATED ONE MADE BY SIR GREGORY IN WHICH HE GAVE A SKETCH OF ALARIC TUDOR
6199-48196-0030 OF A CLERK IN THE CIVIL SERVICE HIS HEART SAID HE ENERGETICALLY IS AT THE WEIGHTS AND MEASURES BUT GERTRUDE LOOKED AT HIM AS THOUGH SHE DID NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
6199-48196-0031 AND SO ALARIC AND GERTRUDE WERE WHISKED AWAY AND THE WEDDING GUESTS WERE LEFT TO LOOK SHEEPISH AT EACH OTHER AND TAKE THEMSELVES OFF AS BEST THEY MIGHT SIR GREGORY OF COURSE HAD IMPORTANT PUBLIC BUSINESS WHICH PRECLUDED HIM FROM HAVING THE GRATIFICATION
6199-48196-0032 OF PROLONGING HIS STAY AT HAMPTON CHARLEY GOT AWAY IN PERFECT TIME TO ENJOY WHATEVER THERE MIGHT BE TO BE ENJOYED AT THE DANCING SALOON OF SEVILLE AND UNDY SCOTT RETURNED TO HIS CLUB THEN ALL WAS AGAIN QUIET AT SURBITON COTTAGE
6199-48196-0033 CAPTAIN CUTTWATER WHO HAD PERHAPS DRUNK THE BRIDE'S HEALTH ONCE TOO OFTEN WENT TO SLEEP KATIE HAVING TAKEN OFF HER FINE CLOTHES ROAMED ABOUT THE HOUSE DISCONSOLATE AND MISSUS WOODWARD AND LINDA BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THEIR NEEDLES
6199-48196-0034 PREVIOUS TO THIS NORMAN HAD BEEN ONCE AND BUT ONCE AT HAMPTON AND WHEN THERE HE HAD FAILED IN BEING COMFORTABLE HIMSELF OR IN MAKING THE WOODWARDS SO HE COULD NOT REVERT TO HIS OLD HABITS OR SIT OR MOVE OR WALK
6199-48196-0035 AS THOUGH NOTHING SPECIAL HAD HAPPENED SINCE HE HAD BEEN LAST THERE HE COULD NOT TALK ABOUT GERTRUDE AND HE COULD NOT HELP TALKING OF HER BY SOME CLOSER PACKING AMONG THE LADIES A ROOM HAD NOW BEEN PREPARED FOR HIM IN THE HOUSE
6199-48196-0036 EVEN THIS UPSET HIM AND BROUGHT TO HIS MIND ALL THOSE UNPLEASANT THOUGHTS WHICH HE SHOULD HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO AVOID
6199-48196-0037 AND THEN FOR SOME TIME HE WAS PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY THE MOVEMENTS OF THE WOODWARDS THEMSELVES MISSUS WOODWARD PAID A VISIT TO HER MARRIED DAUGHTER AND WHEN SHE RETURNED LINDA DID THE SAME AND SO FOR A WHILE NORMAN WAS AS IT WERE
6199-48196-0038 DIVIDED FROM HIS OLD FRIENDS WHEREAS TUDOR AS A MATTER OF COURSE WAS ONE OF THEMSELVES IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT MISSUS WOODWARD SHOULD FORGIVE ALARIC AND RECEIVE HIM TO HER BOSOM NOW THAT HE WAS HER SON IN LAW
6199-48196-0039 AFTER ALL SUCH TIES AS THESE AVAIL MORE THAN ANY PREDILECTIONS MORE THAN ANY EFFORT OF JUDGEMENT IN THE CHOICE OF THE OBJECTS OF OUR AFFECTIONS
