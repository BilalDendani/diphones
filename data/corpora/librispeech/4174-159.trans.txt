4174-159-0000 GROUPS OF MEN AND WOMEN NEVER INTERMIXING
4174-159-0001 WOMEN MAKING MOCHI AS FAST AS THE BUYERS ATE IT BROAD RICE FIELDS ROLLING LIKE A GREEN SEA ON THE RIGHT AN OCEAN OF LIQUID TURQUOISE ON THE LEFT THE GREY ROOFS OF KUBOTA LOOKING OUT FROM THEIR GREEN SURROUNDINGS

4174-159-0003 DISMISSING THE KURUMAS WHICH COULD GO NO FARTHER WE DIVED INTO THE CROWD WHICH WAS WEDGED ALONG A MEAN STREET NEARLY A MILE LONG A MISERABLE STREET OF POOR TEA HOUSES AND POOR SHOP FRONTS BUT IN FACT

4174-159-0009 ALL SORTS OF MASKS DOLLS SUGAR FIGURES TOYS AND SWEETMEATS WERE EXPOSED FOR SALE ON MATS ON THE GROUND AND FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE HANDS AND SLEEVES OF THE CHILDREN FOR NO JAPANESE PARENT WOULD EVER ATTEND A MATSURI WITHOUT MAKING AN OFFERING TO HIS CHILD
4174-159-0010 THE POLICE TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND STRANGERS IN MINATO YET FOR THIRTY TWO THOUSAND HOLIDAY MAKERS A FORCE OF TWENTY FIVE POLICEMEN WAS SUFFICIENT
4174-159-0011 WHEN I LEFT NOR A SOLITARY INSTANCE OF RUDE OR IMPROPER BEHAVIOUR
4174-159-0012 FOR EVEN WHERE THE CROWD WAS DENSEST THE PEOPLE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD FORMED A RING AND LEFT ME BREATHING SPACE
4174-159-0013 WE WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THE THRONG WAS GREATEST ROUND THE TWO GREAT MATSURI CARS WHOSE COLOSSAL ERECTIONS WE HAD SEEN FAR OFF THESE WERE STRUCTURES OF HEAVY BEAMS THIRTY FEET LONG WITH EIGHT HUGE SOLID WHEELS
4174-159-0014 AND TWO SPECIAL PEAKS OF UNEQUAL HEIGHT AT THE TOP THE WHOLE BEING NEARLY FIFTY FEET FROM THE GROUND ALL THESE PROJECTIONS WERE COVERED WITH BLACK COTTON CLOTH FROM WHICH BRANCHES OF PINES PROTRUDED

4174-159-0016 AND AN ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE COTTON FITFULLY AGITATED BY A PAIR OF BELLOWS BELOW REPRESENTED THE SEA
4174-159-0017 BUT ANYTHING MORE RUDE AND BARBAROUS COULD SCARCELY BE SEEN ON THE FRONTS OF EACH CAR UNDER A CANOPY WERE THIRTY PERFORMERS ON THIRTY DIABOLICAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH RENT THE AIR WITH A TRULY INFERNAL DISCORD
4174-159-0018 AND SUGGESTED DEVILS RATHER THAN THEIR CONQUERORS HIGH UP ON THE FLAT PROJECTIONS THERE WERE GROUPS OF MONSTROUS FIGURES ON ONE A GIANT IN BRASS ARMOUR MUCH LIKE THE NIO OF TEMPLE GATES WAS KILLING A REVOLTING LOOKING DEMON
4174-159-0019 ON ANOTHER A DAIMIYO'S DAUGHTER IN ROBES OF CLOTH OF GOLD WITH SATIN SLEEVES RICHLY FLOWERED WAS PLAYING ON THE SAMISEN ON ANOTHER A HUNTER THRICE THE SIZE OF LIFE WAS KILLING A WILD HORSE EQUALLY MAGNIFIED
4174-159-0020 AND THIS WAS ITS THIRD AND GREATEST DAY WE LEFT ON MILD TEMPERED HORSES QUITE UNLIKE THE FIERCE FELLOWS OF YAMAGATA KEN
4174-159-0021 CONNECTED WITH THE SEA BY A NARROW CHANNEL GUARDED BY TWO HIGH HILLS CALLED SHINZAN AND HONZAN TWO DUTCH ENGINEERS ARE NOW ENGAGED IN REPORTING ON ITS CAPACITIES AND IF ITS OUTLET COULD BE DEEPENED WITHOUT ENORMOUS COST
4174-159-0022 IT WOULD GIVE NORTH WESTERN JAPAN THE HARBOUR IT SO GREATLY NEEDS EXTENSIVE RICE FIELDS AND MANY VILLAGES LIE ALONG THE ROAD WHICH IS AN AVENUE OF DEEP SAND AND ANCIENT PINES MUCH CONTORTED AND GNARLED
4174-159-0023 DOWN THE PINE AVENUE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON HORSEBACK AND ON FOOT WERE TROOPING INTO MINATO FROM ALL THE FARMING VILLAGES GLAD IN THE GLORIOUS SUNSHINE WHICH SUCCEEDED FOUR DAYS OF RAIN THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF HORSES
4174-159-0024 CARRYING TWO GRAVE AND STATELY LOOKING CHILDREN IN EACH AND SOMETIMES A FATHER OR A FIFTH CHILD ON THE TOP OF THE PACK SADDLE
4174-159-0025 IN A LOFT ALIVE WITH FLEAS WHERE THE RICE WAS TOO DIRTY TO BE EATEN AND WHERE THE HOUSE MASTER'S WIFE WHO SAT FOR AN HOUR ON MY FLOOR WAS SORELY AFFLICTED WITH SKIN DISEASE THE CLAY HOUSES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THE VILLAGES ARE NOW BUILT OF WOOD
4174-159-0026 FOR THE ENTANGLEMENT OF UNWARY PASSENGERS THE VILLAGE SMITH WAS OPPOSITE BUT HE WAS NOT A MAN OF PONDEROUS STRENGTH NOR WERE THERE THOSE WONDROUS FLIGHTS AND SCINTILLATIONS OF SPARKS
4174-159-0027 WHICH WERE THE JOY OF OUR CHILDHOOD IN THE TATTENHALL FORGE A FIRE OF POWDERED CHARCOAL ON THE FLOOR ALWAYS BEING TRIMMED AND REPLENISHED BY A LEAN AND GRIMY SATELLITE
4174-159-0028 A MAN STILL LEANER AND GRIMIER CLOTHED IN GOGGLES AND A GIRDLE ALWAYS SITTING IN FRONT OF IT HEATING AND HAMMERING IRON BARS WITH HIS HANDS WITH A CLINK WHICH WENT ON LATE INTO THE NIGHT AND BLOWING HIS BELLOWS WITH HIS TOES
4174-159-0029 BARS AND PIECES OF RUSTY IRON PINNED ON THE SMOKY WALLS AND A GROUP OF IDLE MEN WATCHING HIS SKILFUL MANIPULATION WERE THE SIGHTS OF THE ABUKAWA SMITHY AND KEPT ME THRALLED IN THE BALCONY
4174-159-0030 WHICH TURNED INTO A TREMENDOUS TORRENT WHICH HAS LASTED FOR SIXTEEN HOURS LOW HILLS BROAD RICE VALLEYS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE PUDDLING THE RICE A SECOND TIME TO KILL THE WEEDS BAD ROADS PRETTY VILLAGES MUCH INDIGO FEW PASSENGERS
4174-159-0031 WERE THE FEATURES OF THE DAY'S JOURNEY
4174-159-0032 I NOTICED THAT IF YOU SEE ONE LARGE HIGH WELL BUILT HOUSE STANDING IN ENCLOSED GROUNDS
4174-159-0033 AND THESE ARE OF ALL SORTS FROM THE MANGY BIT OF FIR WHICH HAS SEEN LONG SERVICE TO THE VIGOROUS TRUSS OF PINE CONSTANTLY RENEWED IT IS CURIOUS THAT THIS SHOULD FORMERLY HAVE BEEN THE SIGN OF THE SALE OF WINE IN ENGLAND
4174-159-0034 THE WIND AND RAIN WERE SOMETHING FEARFUL ALL THAT AFTERNOON I COULD NOT RIDE SO I TRAMPED ON FOOT FOR SOME MILES UNDER AN AVENUE OF PINES THROUGH WATER A FOOT DEEP AND WITH MY PAPER WATERPROOF SOAKED THROUGH
4174-159-0035 REACHED TOYOKA HALF DROWNED AND VERY COLD TO SHIVER OVER A HIBACHI IN A CLEAN LOFT HUNG WITH MY DRIPPING CLOTHES WHICH HAD TO BE PUT ON WET THE NEXT DAY BY FIVE A M ALL TOYOKA ASSEMBLED
4174-159-0036 AND WHILE I TOOK MY BREAKFAST I WAS NOT ONLY THE CYNOSURE OF THE EYES OF ALL THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE BUT OF THOSE OF ABOUT FORTY MORE WHO WERE STANDING IN THE DOMA LOOKING UP THE LADDER WHEN ASKED TO DEPART BY THE HOUSE MASTER THEY SAID
