2774-131722-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN MAGNETIC ORE MILLING WORK DURING THE HUDSON FULTON CELEBRATION OF OCTOBER NINETEEN O NINE BURGOMASTER VAN LEEUWEN
2774-131722-0001 OF AMSTERDAM MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION SENT OFFICIALLY FROM HOLLAND TO ESCORT THE HALF MOON AND PARTICIPATE IN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ANNIVERSARY PAID A VISIT TO THE EDISON LABORATORY AT ORANGE TO SEE THE INVENTOR WHO MAY BE REGARDED AS PRE EMINENT AMONG THOSE OF DUTCH DESCENT IN THIS COUNTRY
2774-131722-0002 FOUND AS USUAL HARD AT WORK THIS TIME ON HIS CEMENT HOUSE OF WHICH HE SHOWED THE IRON MOLDS EDISON TOOK OCCASION TO REMARK THAT IF HE HAD ACHIEVED ANYTHING WORTH WHILE IT WAS DUE TO THE OBSTINACY AND PERTINACITY HE HAD INHERITED FROM HIS FOREFATHERS
2774-131722-0003 HE HAS BEEN NOT LESS ASSIDUOUS THAN THEY IN REDUCING THE ROCKS OF THE EARTH ITSELF TO FLOUR ALTHOUGH THIS PHASE OF MISTER EDISON'S DIVERSE ACTIVITIES IS NOT AS GENERALLY KNOWN TO THE WORLD AS MANY OTHERS OF A MORE POPULAR CHARACTER
2774-131722-0004 LOW GRADE IRON ORE AS CARRIED ON AT EDISON NEW JERSEY PROVED TO BE THE MOST COLOSSAL EXPERIMENT THAT HE HAS EVER MADE
2774-131722-0005 HE COULD TRUTHFULLY ANSWER BOTH YES AND NO YES IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH MISTER EDISON HAD NO CONTROL COMPELLED THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THE PLANT AT THE VERY MOMENT OF SUCCESS AND NO
2774-131722-0006 IN THAT THE MECHANICALLY SUCCESSFUL AND COMMERCIALLY PRACTICAL RESULTS OBTAINED AFTER THE EXERCISE OF STUPENDOUS EFFORTS AND THE EXPENDITURE OF A FORTUNE ARE SO CONCLUSIVE THAT THEY MUST INEVITABLY BE THE RELIANCE OF MANY FUTURE IRON MASTERS
2774-131722-0007 IN OTHER WORDS MISTER EDISON WAS AT LEAST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AHEAD OF THE TIMES IN THE WORK NOW TO BE CONSIDERED
2774-131722-0008 LARGE BEDS OF BLACK SAND ON THE BEACH IN LAYERS FROM ONE TO SIX INCHES THICK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TONS MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY EASY MATTER TO CONCENTRATE THIS AND I FOUND I COULD SELL THE STUFF AT A GOOD PRICE
2774-131722-0009 AND THAT BUSINESS WAS SLOWLY DRIFTING WESTWARD
2774-131722-0010 THIS ORE COULD BE EXCAVATED VERY CHEAPLY BY MEANS OF IMPROVED MINING FACILITIES AND TRANSPORTED AT LOW COST TO LAKE PORTS HENCE THE IRON AND STEEL MILLS EAST OF THE ALLEGHANIES COMPELLED TO RELY ON LIMITED LOCAL DEPOSITS OF BESSEMER ORE
2774-131722-0011 AND UPON FOREIGN ORES WHICH WERE CONSTANTLY RISING IN VALUE BEGAN TO SUSTAIN A SERIOUS COMPETITION WITH WESTERN MILLS EVEN IN EASTERN MARKETS
2774-131722-0012 LONG BEFORE THIS SITUATION AROSE IT HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED BY EASTERN IRON MASTERS THAT SOONER OR LATER THE DEPOSITS OF HIGH GRADE ORE WOULD BE EXHAUSTED AND IN CONSEQUENCE THERE WOULD ENSUE A COMPELLING NECESSITY TO FALL BACK ON THE LOW GRADE MAGNETIC ORES
2774-131722-0013 BY CONCENTRATION OF THE IRON PARTICLES ASSOCIATED WITH IT SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM MANY ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE IN BY GONE DAYS TO CONCENTRATE THE IRON IN SUCH ORES BY WATER PROCESSES BUT WITH ONLY A PARTIAL DEGREE OF SUCCESS
2774-131722-0014 THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING A UNIFORM CONCENTRATE WAS A MOST SERIOUS OBJECTION HAD THERE NOT INDEED BEEN OTHER DIFFICULTIES WHICH RENDERED THIS METHOD COMMERCIALLY IMPRACTICABLE IT IS QUITE NATURAL THEREFORE THAT THE IDEA OF MAGNETIC SEPARATION SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO MANY INVENTORS
2774-131722-0015 THUS WE FIND NUMEROUS INSTANCES THROUGHOUT THE LAST CENTURY OF EXPERIMENTS ALONG THIS LINE AND PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS DURING WHICH VARIOUS ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY OTHERS THAN EDISON TO PERFECT MAGNETIC SEPARATION AND BRING IT UP TO SOMETHING LIKE COMMERCIAL PRACTICE
2774-131722-0016 IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT IT WAS CHEAPER TO QUARRY AND CONCENTRATE LEAN ORE IN A BIG WAY THAN TO ATTEMPT TO MINE UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED BODIES OF HIGH GRADE ORE HE APPRECIATED FULLY THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE GIGANTIC QUESTIONS INVOLVED
2774-131722-0017 IN WHICH HE CONTEMPLATED THE AUTOMATIC HANDLING OF MANY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF MATERIAL DAILY IT MAY BE STATED AS BROADLY TRUE THAT EDISON ENGINEERED TO HANDLE IMMENSE MASSES OF STUFF AUTOMATICALLY WHILE HIS PREDECESSORS AIMED CHIEFLY AT CLOSE SEPARATION
2774-131722-0018 REDUCED TO ITS BAREST CRUDEST TERMS THE PROPOSITION OF MAGNETIC SEPARATION IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF A PIECE OF THE ORE MAGNETITE MAY BE REDUCED TO POWDER AND THE ORE PARTICLES SEPARATED THEREFROM BY THE HELP OF A SIMPLE HAND MAGNET TO ELUCIDATE THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF EDISON'S METHOD
2774-131722-0019 THE MAGNETIC PARTICLES ARE ATTRACTED OUT OF THE STRAIGHT LINE OF THE FALLING STREAM AND BEING HEAVY GRAVITATE INWARDLY AND FALL TO ONE SIDE OF A PARTITION PLACED BELOW THE NON MAGNETIC GANGUE DESCENDS IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTITION THUS A COMPLETE SEPARATION IS EFFECTED
2774-131722-0020 SIMPLE THOUGH THE PRINCIPLE APPEARS IT WAS IN ITS APPLICATION TO VAST MASSES OF MATERIAL AND IN THE SOLVING OF GREAT ENGINEERING PROBLEMS CONNECTED THEREWITH THAT EDISON'S ORIGINALITY MADE ITSELF MANIFEST IN THE CONCENTRATING WORKS THAT HE ESTABLISHED IN NEW JERSEY EARLY IN THE NINETIES
2774-131722-0021 NOT ONLY DID HE DEVELOP THOROUGHLY THE REFINING OF THE CRUSHED ORE SO THAT AFTER IT HAD PASSED THE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MAGNETS IN THE MILL THE CONCENTRATES CAME OUT FINALLY CONTAINING NINETY ONE TO NINETY THREE PER CENT
2774-131722-0022 BUT HE ALSO DEVISED COLLATERAL MACHINERY METHODS AND PROCESSES ALL FUNDAMENTAL IN THEIR NATURE THESE ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO SPECIFY IN DETAIL AS THEY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE VARIOUS RAMIFICATIONS OF THE PLANT BUT THE PRINCIPAL ONES ARE WORTHY OF MENTION SUCH AS
2774-131722-0023 THAT MISTER EDISON'S WORK WAS APPRECIATED AT THE TIME IS MADE EVIDENT BY THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM AN ARTICLE DESCRIBING THE EDISON PLANT PUBLISHED IN THE IRON AGE OF OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN IN WHICH AFTER MENTIONING HIS STRUGGLE WITH ADVERSE CONDITIONS IT SAYS
2774-131722-0024 THERE IS VERY LITTLE THAT IS SHOWY FROM THE POPULAR POINT OF VIEW IN THE GIGANTIC WORK WHICH MISTER EDISON HAS DONE DURING THESE YEARS BUT TO THOSE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF GRASPING THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED MISTER EDISON APPEARS IN THE NEW LIGHT OF A BRILLIANT CONSTRUCTING ENGINEER
2774-131722-0025 GRAPPLING WITH TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL PROBLEMS OF THE HIGHEST ORDER HIS GENIUS AS AN INVENTOR IS REVEALED IN MANY DETAILS OF THE GREAT CONCENTRATING PLANT BUT TO OUR MIND
2774-131722-0026 ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND STRIKING INVESTIGATIONS MADE BY EDISON IN THIS CONNECTION IS WORTHY OF NOTE AND MAY BE RELATED IN HIS OWN WORDS I FELT CERTAIN THAT THERE MUST BE LARGE BODIES OF MAGNETITE IN THE EAST
2774-131722-0027 HAVING DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE MOUNTAIN REGIONS OF NEW JERSEY I CONSTRUCTED A VERY SENSITIVE MAGNETIC NEEDLE
2774-131722-0028 BUT DID NOT FIND DEPOSITS OF ANY MAGNITUDE ONE DAY HOWEVER AS WE DROVE OVER A MOUNTAIN RANGE NOT KNOWN AS IRON BEARING LAND I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT THE NEEDLE WAS STRONGLY ATTRACTED AND REMAINED SO THUS INDICATING THAT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN WAS UNDERLAID WITH VAST BODIES OF MAGNETIC ORE
2774-131722-0029 I KNEW IT WAS A COMMERCIAL PROBLEM TO PRODUCE HIGH GRADE BESSEMER ORE FROM THESE DEPOSITS AND TOOK STEPS TO ACQUIRE A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE PROPERTY I ALSO PLANNED A GREAT MAGNETIC SURVEY OF THE EAST AND I BELIEVE IT REMAINS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE OF ITS KIND YET PERFORMED
2774-131722-0030 I HAD A NUMBER OF MEN SURVEY A STRIP REACHING FROM LOWER CANADA TO NORTH CAROLINA THE ONLY INSTRUMENT WE USED WAS THE SPECIAL MAGNETIC NEEDLE WE STARTED IN LOWER CANADA AND TRAVELLED ACROSS THE LINE OF MARCH TWENTY FIVE MILES THEN ADVANCED SOUTH ONE THOUSAND FEET
2774-131722-0031 THEN BACK ACROSS THE LINE OF MARCH AGAIN TWENTY FIVE MILES THEN SOUTH ANOTHER THOUSAND FEET ACROSS AGAIN AND SO ON THUS WE ADVANCED ALL THE WAY TO NORTH CAROLINA VARYING OUR CROSS COUNTRY MARCH FROM TWO TO TWENTY FIVE MILES ACCORDING TO GEOLOGICAL FORMATION
2774-131722-0032 WE ALSO KNEW THE WIDTH LENGTH AND APPROXIMATE DEPTH OF EVERY ONE OF THESE DEPOSITS WHICH WERE ENORMOUS THE AMOUNT OF ORE DISCLOSED BY THIS SURVEY WAS SIMPLY FABULOUS
2774-131722-0033 I ALSO SECURED SIXTEEN THOUSAND ACRES IN WHICH THE DEPOSIT WAS PROPORTIONATELY AS LARGE THESE FEW ACRES ALONE CONTAINED SUFFICIENT ORE TO SUPPLY THE WHOLE UNITED STATES IRON TRADE INCLUDING EXPORTS FOR SEVENTY YEARS
2774-131722-0034 GIVEN A MOUNTAIN OF ROCK CONTAINING ONLY ONE FIFTH TO ONE FOURTH MAGNETIC IRON THE BROAD PROBLEM CONFRONTING EDISON RESOLVED ITSELF INTO THREE DISTINCT PARTS FIRST TO TEAR DOWN THE MOUNTAIN BODILY AND GRIND IT TO POWDER SECOND TO EXTRACT FROM THIS POWDER THE PARTICLES OF IRON
2774-131722-0035 MINGLED IN ITS MASS AND THIRD TO ACCOMPLISH THESE RESULTS AT A COST SUFFICIENTLY LOW TO GIVE THE PRODUCT A COMMERCIAL VALUE
2774-131722-0036 WHILE THERE WAS NO TOUCH OF THE HUMAN HAND UPON THE MATERIAL FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE TREATMENT TO ITS FINISH
2774-131722-0037 HE COULD NOT DEPEND UPON THE MARKET TO SUPPLY SUITABLE MACHINERY FOR IMPORTANT OPERATIONS BUT WOULD BE OBLIGED TO DEVISE AND BUILD IT HIMSELF THUS OUTSIDE THE STEAM SHOVEL AND SUCH STAPLE ITEMS AS ENGINES BOILERS DYNAMOS AND MOTORS
2774-131722-0038 ALL OF THE DIVERSE AND COMPLEX MACHINERY OF THE ENTIRE CONCENTRATING PLANT AS SUBSEQUENTLY COMPLETED
2774-131722-0039 NO SUCH DEPARTURE WAS AS RADICAL AS THAT OF THE METHOD OF CRUSHING THE ORE EXISTING MACHINERY FOR THIS PURPOSE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ON THE BASIS OF MINING METHODS THEN IN VOGUE BY WHICH THE ROCK WAS THOROUGHLY SHATTERED BY MEANS OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES AND REDUCED TO PIECES OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS OR LESS
2774-131722-0040 FROM A CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTS AND WITH HIS USUAL TENDENCY TO UPSET TRADITIONAL OBSERVANCES EDISON CONCEIVED THE BOLD IDEA OF CONSTRUCTING GIGANTIC ROLLS WHICH BY THE FORCE OF MOMENTUM WOULD BE CAPABLE OF CRUSHING INDIVIDUAL ROCKS OF VASTLY GREATER SIZE THAN EVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED
2774-131722-0041 HE REASONED THAT THE ADVANTAGES THUS OBTAINED WOULD BE FOURFOLD A MINIMUM OF MACHINERY AND PARTS GREATER COMPACTNESS A SAVING OF POWER AND GREATER ECONOMY IN MINING AS THIS LAST NAMED OPERATION PRECEDES THE CRUSHING LET US FIRST CONSIDER IT AS IT WAS PROJECTED AND CARRIED ON BY HIM
2774-131722-0042 THE FAITH THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS HAD A NEW OPPORTUNITY IN WORK OF THIS NATURE IT HAD BEEN CUSTOMARY AS ABOVE STATED TO DEPEND UPON A HIGH EXPLOSIVE SUCH AS DYNAMITE
2774-131722-0043 THIS HOWEVER HE DEEMED TO BE A MOST UNECONOMICAL PROCESS
2774-131722-0044 THIS WAS THE PLAN THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUT INTO PRACTICE IN THE GREAT WORKS AT EDISON NEW JERSEY A SERIES OF THREE INCH HOLES TWENTY FEET DEEP WERE DRILLED EIGHT FEET APART ABOUT TWELVE FEET BACK OF THE ORE BANK AND INTO THESE WERE INSERTED DYNAMITE CARTRIDGES
2774-131722-0045 THE PROBLEM INCLUDED HANDLING AND CRUSHING THE RUN OF THE MINE WITHOUT SELECTION THE STEAM SHOVEL DID NOT DISCRIMINATE BUT PICKED UP HANDILY SINGLE PIECES WEIGHING FIVE OR SIX TONS AND LOADED THEM ON THE SKIPS WITH QUANTITIES OF SMALLER LUMPS
2774-131722-0046 WHEN THE SKIPS ARRIVED AT THE GIANT ROLLS THEIR CONTENTS WERE DUMPED AUTOMATICALLY INTO A SUPERIMPOSED HOPPER THE ROLLS WERE WELL NAMED FOR WITH EAR SPLITTING NOISE THEY BROKE UP IN A FEW SECONDS THE GREAT PIECES OF ROCK TOSSED IN FROM THE SKIPS
2774-131722-0047 IT IS NOT EASY TO APPRECIATE TO THE FULL THE DARING EXEMPLIFIED IN THESE GREAT CRUSHING ROLLS OR RATHER ROCK CRACKERS
2774-131722-0048 THAT THE MIND WAS OVERWHELMED WITH A SENSE OF THE MAGNIFICENT PROPORTIONS OF THIS OPERATION THE ENORMOUS FORCE EXERTED DURING THIS PROCESS MAY BE ILLUSTRATED FROM THE FACT THAT DURING ITS DEVELOPMENT IN RUNNING ONE OF THE EARLY FORMS OF ROLLS
2774-131722-0049 THE GIANT ROLLS WERE TWO SOLID CYLINDERS SIX FEET IN DIAMETER AND FIVE FEET LONG MADE OF CAST IRON TO THE FACES OF THESE ROLLS WERE BOLTED A SERIES OF HEAVY CHILLED IRON PLATES CONTAINING A NUMBER OF PROJECTING KNOBS TWO INCHES HIGH
2774-131722-0050 EACH ROLL HAD ALSO TWO ROWS OF FOUR INCH KNOBS INTENDED TO STRIKE A SERIES OF HAMMER LIKE BLOWS THE ROLLS WERE SET FACE TO FACE FOURTEEN INCHES APART IN A HEAVY FRAME AND THE TOTAL WEIGHT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TONS OF WHICH SEVENTY TONS WERE IN MOVING PARTS
2774-131722-0051 THE SPACE BETWEEN THESE TWO ROLLS ALLOWED PIECES OF ROCK MEASURING LESS THAN FOURTEEN INCHES TO DESCEND TO OTHER SMALLER ROLLS PLACED BELOW THE GIANT ROLLS WERE BELT DRIVEN IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THROUGH FRICTION CLUTCHES ALTHOUGH THE BELT WAS NOT DEPENDED UPON FOR THE ACTUAL CRUSHING
2774-131722-0052 IT WAS AS THOUGH A ROCK OF THIS SIZE HAD GOT IN THE WAY OF TWO EXPRESS TRAINS TRAVELLING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AT NEARLY SIXTY MILES AN HOUR IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE ROLLS THAT CRUMBLED UP THE ROCKS WITH PILE DRIVER EFFECT THIS SUDDEN STRAIN MIGHT HAVE TENDED TO STOP THE ENGINE DRIVING THE ROLLS
2774-131722-0053 THE BELT WAS RELEASED AT THE MOMENT OF RESISTANCE IN THE ROLLS BY REASON OF THE ROCKS FALLING BETWEEN THEM THE ACT OF BREAKING AND CRUSHING WOULD NATURALLY DECREASE THE TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM BUT AFTER THE ROCK WAS REDUCED AND THE PIECES HAD PASSED THROUGH
2774-131722-0054 THE BELT WOULD AGAIN COME INTO PLAY AND ONCE MORE SPEED UP THE ROLLS FOR A REPETITION OF THEIR REGULAR PRIZE FIGHTER DUTY ON LEAVING THE GIANT ROLLS THE ROCKS HAVING BEEN REDUCED TO PIECES NOT LARGER THAN FOURTEEN INCHES PASSED INTO THE SERIES OF INTERMEDIATE ROLLS OF SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION
2774-131722-0055 BY WHICH THEY WERE STILL FURTHER REDUCED AND AGAIN PASSED ON TO THREE OTHER SETS OF ROLLS OF SMALLER DIMENSIONS THESE LATTER ROLLS WERE ALSO FACE LINED WITH CHILLED IRON PLATES BUT UNLIKE THE LARGER ONES WERE POSITIVELY DRIVEN REDUCING THE ROCK TO PIECES OF ABOUT ONE HALF INCH SIZE OR SMALLER
2774-131722-0056 THE WHOLE CRUSHING OPERATION OF REDUCTION FROM MASSIVE BOULDERS TO SMALL PEBBLY PIECES HAVING BEEN DONE IN LESS TIME THAN THE TELLING HAS OCCUPIED THE PRODUCT WAS CONVEYED TO THE DRYER A TOWER NINE FEET SQUARE AND FIFTY FEET HIGH
2774-131722-0057 HEATED FROM BELOW BY GREAT OPEN FURNACE FIRES ALL DOWN THE INSIDE WALLS OF THIS TOWER WERE PLACED CAST IRON PLATES NINE FEET LONG AND SEVEN INCHES WIDE ARRANGED ALTERNATELY IN FISH LADDER FASHION
2774-131722-0058 THE ROCK BROKEN UP INTO PIECES ABOUT THE SIZE OF MARBLES HAVING BEEN DRIED AND CONVEYED TO THE STOCK HOUSE THE SURPLUSAGE WAS AUTOMATICALLY CARRIED OUT FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STOCK HOUSE BY CONVEYORS TO PASS THROUGH THE NEXT PROCESS
2774-131722-0059 BY WHICH IT WAS REDUCED TO A POWDER THE MACHINERY FOR ACCOMPLISHING THIS RESULT REPRESENTS ANOTHER INTERESTING AND RADICAL DEPARTURE OF EDISON FROM ACCEPTED USAGE HE HAD INVESTIGATED ALL THE CRUSHING MACHINES ON THE MARKET AND TRIED ALL HE COULD GET HE FOUND THEM ALL GREATLY LACKING IN ECONOMY OF OPERATION
2774-131722-0060 INDEED THE HIGHEST RESULTS OBTAINABLE FROM THE BEST WERE EIGHTEEN PER CENT OF ACTUAL WORK INVOLVING A LOSS OF EIGHTY TWO PER CENT BY FRICTION HIS NATURE REVOLTED AT SUCH AN IMMENSE LOSS OF POWER ESPECIALLY AS HE PROPOSED THE CRUSHING OF VAST QUANTITIES OF ORE THUS HE WAS OBLIGED TO BEGIN AGAIN AT THE FOUNDATION
2774-131722-0061 AND WHICH PRACTICALLY REVERSED THE ABOVE FIGURES AS IT DEVELOPED EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT OF WORK DONE WITH ONLY SIXTEEN PER CENT LOSS IN FRICTION A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THIS REMARKABLE MACHINE WILL PROBABLY INTEREST THE READER
2774-131722-0062 IN THE TWO END PIECES OF A HEAVY IRON FRAME WERE SET THREE ROLLS OR CYLINDERS ONE IN THE CENTRE ANOTHER BELOW AND THE OTHER ABOVE ALL THREE BEING IN A VERTICAL LINE
2774-131722-0063 HAVING CHILLED IRON SMOOTH FACE PLATES OF CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS THE LOWEST ROLL WAS SET IN A FIXED BEARING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME AND THEREFORE COULD ONLY TURN AROUND ON ITS AXIS THE MIDDLE AND TOP ROLLS WERE FREE TO MOVE UP OR DOWN FROM AND TOWARD THE LOWER ROLL
2774-131722-0064 IN WHICH WAS RUN A HALF INCH ENDLESS WIRE ROPE THIS ROPE WAS WOUND SEVEN TIMES OVER THE SHEAVES AS ABOVE
2774-131722-0065 AND IN THIS MANNER THE PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO THE ROLLS IT WILL BE SEEN THEREFORE THAT THE SYSTEM CONSISTED IN A SINGLE ROPE PASSED OVER SHEAVES AND SO ARRANGED THAT IT COULD BE VARIED IN LENGTH
2774-131722-0066 FRICTION WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY ELIMINATED BECAUSE THE UPPER AND LOWER ROLL BEARINGS TURNED WITH THE ROLLS AND REVOLVED IN THE WIRE ROPE WHICH CONSTITUTED THE BEARING PROPER THE SAME CAUTIOUS FORESIGHT EXERCISED BY EDISON IN PROVIDING A SAFETY DEVICE THE FUSE
2774-131722-0067 TO PREVENT FIRES IN HIS ELECTRIC LIGHT SYSTEM WAS AGAIN DISPLAYED IN THIS CONCENTRATING PLANT WHERE TO SAVE POSSIBLE INJURY TO ITS EXPENSIVE OPERATING PARTS HE DEVISED AN ANALOGOUS FACTOR PROVIDING ALL THE CRUSHING MACHINERY WITH CLOSELY CALCULATED SAFETY PINS
2774-131722-0068 WHICH BESIDES HAVING A VERY LARGE WORKING CAPACITY BY GRAVITY ELIMINATED ALL POWER EXCEPT THAT REQUIRED TO ELEVATE THE MATERIAL THE SCREENING PROCESS ALLOWED THE FINEST PART OF THE CRUSHED ROCK TO PASS ON BY CONVEYOR BELTS TO THE MAGNETIC SEPARATORS
2774-131722-0069 WHILE THE COARSER PARTICLES WERE IN LIKE MANNER AUTOMATICALLY RETURNED TO THE ROLLS FOR FURTHER REDUCTION IN A NARRATIVE NOT INTENDED TO BE STRICTLY TECHNICAL IT WOULD PROBABLY TIRE THE READER TO FOLLOW THIS MATERIAL IN DETAIL THROUGH THE NUMEROUS STEPS ATTENDING THE MAGNETIC SEPARATION
2774-131722-0070 THIS SAND WAS TRANSPORTED AUTOMATICALLY BY BELT CONVEYORS TO THE REAR OF THE WORKS TO BE STORED AND SOLD BEING SHARP CRYSTALLINE AND EVEN IN QUALITY IT WAS A VALUABLE BY PRODUCT FINDING A READY SALE FOR BUILDING PURPOSES RAILWAY SAND BOXES AND VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL USES
2774-131722-0071 THE CONCENTRATE IN FINE POWDERY FORM WAS DELIVERED IN SIMILAR MANNER TO A STOCK HOUSE AS TO THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS WE MAY NOW QUOTE AGAIN FROM THE ARTICLE IN THE IRON AGE
2774-131722-0072 EXPOSED TO SNOW AND RAIN IN MANY RESPECTS THE ATTAINMENT OF THESE SOMEWHAT CONFLICTING ENDS WAS THE MOST PERPLEXING OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH CONFRONTED MISTER EDISON THE AGGLOMERATION OF THE CONCENTRATES HAVING BEEN DECIDED UPON TWO OTHER CONSIDERATIONS NOT MENTIONED ABOVE WERE OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE
2774-131722-0073 FIRST TO FIND A SUITABLE CHEAP BINDING MATERIAL AND SECOND ITS NATURE MUST BE SUCH THAT VERY LITTLE WOULD BE NECESSARY PER TON OF CONCENTRATES THESE SEVERE REQUIREMENTS WERE STAGGERING BUT MISTER EDISON'S COURAGE DID NOT FALTER ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED A WELL NIGH HOPELESS TASK
2774-131722-0074 THIS WAS THE FINAL PROCESS REQUISITE FOR THE MAKING OF A COMPLETED COMMERCIAL PRODUCT ITS PRACTICE OF COURSE NECESSITATED THE ADDITION OF AN ENTIRELY NEW DEPARTMENT OF THE WORKS WHICH WAS CARRIED INTO EFFECT BY THE CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF THE NOVEL MIXING AND BRIQUETTING MACHINERY
2774-131722-0075 WHILE THEY WERE SO POROUS AS TO BE CAPABLE OF ABSORBING TWENTY SIX PER CENT OF THEIR OWN VOLUME IN ALCOHOL BUT REPELLING WATER ABSOLUTELY PERFECT OLD SOAKS
2774-131722-0076 THUS WITH NEVER FAILING PERSISTENCE AND PATIENCE COUPLED WITH INTENSE THOUGHT AND HARD WORK EDISON MET AND CONQUERED ONE BY ONE THE COMPLEX DIFFICULTIES THAT CONFRONTED HIM
2774-131722-0077 AND IT IS NOW TO BE NOTED THAT THE PRODUCT HE HAD STRIVEN SO SEDULOUSLY TO OBTAIN WAS A HIGHLY COMMERCIAL ONE FOR NOT ONLY DID THE BRIQUETTES OF CONCENTRATED ORE FULFIL THE PURPOSE OF THEIR CREATION BUT IN USE ACTUALLY TENDED TO INCREASE THE WORKING CAPACITY OF THE FURNACE
2774-131722-0078 TWO POINT FIVE SEVEN TWO
2774-131722-0079 ON THE NINTH AT FIVE P M THE BRIQUETTES HAVING BEEN NEARLY EXHAUSTED THE PERCENTAGE WAS DROPPED TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT AND ON THE TENTH THE OUTPUT DROPPED TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TONS
2774-131722-0080 THESE FIGURES PROVE THAT THE YIELD OF THE FURNACE IS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED THE CRANE TRIAL WAS TOO SHORT TO SETTLE THE QUESTION TO WHAT EXTENT THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT MAY BE CARRIED THIS INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF COURSE MEANS A REDUCTION IN THE COST OF LABOR AND OF GENERAL EXPENSES
2774-131722-0081 THE RICHNESS OF THE ORE AND ITS PURITY OF COURSE AFFECT THE LIMESTONE CONSUMPTION IN THE CASE OF THE CRANE TRIAL THERE WAS A REDUCTION FROM THIRTY PER CENT TO TWELVE PER CENT OF THE ORE CHARGE FINALLY THE FUEL CONSUMPTION IS REDUCED WHICH IN THE CASE OF THE EASTERN PLANTS WITH THEIR RELATIVELY COSTLY COKE
2774-131722-0082 IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IT IS REGARDED AS POSSIBLE THAT EASTERN FURNACES WILL BE ABLE TO USE A SMALLER PROPORTION OF THE COSTLIER COKE AND CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASE IN ANTHRACITE COAL WHICH IS A CHEAPER FUEL IN THAT SECTION SO FAR AS FOUNDRY IRON IS CONCERNED THE EXPERIENCE AT CATASAUQUA
2774-131722-0083 PENNSYLVANIA BRIEF AS IT HAS BEEN SHOWS THAT A STRONGER AND TOUGHER METAL IS MADE EDISON HIMSELF TELLS AN INTERESTING LITTLE STORY IN THIS CONNECTION WHEN HE ENJOYED THE ACTIVE HELP OF THAT NOBLE CHARACTER JOHN FRITZ THE DISTINGUISHED INVENTOR AND PIONEER OF THE MODERN STEEL INDUSTRY IN AMERICA HE SAYS
2774-131722-0084 WHEN I WAS STRUGGLING ALONG WITH THE IRON ORE CONCENTRATION I WENT TO SEE SEVERAL BLAST FURNACE MEN TO SELL THE ORE AT THE MARKET PRICE THEY SAW I WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SELL IT AND THEY WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY NECESSITY
2774-131722-0085 AND TOLD HIM WHAT I WAS DOING WELL HE SAID TO ME EDISON YOU ARE DOING A GOOD THING FOR THE EASTERN FURNACES THEY OUGHT TO HELP YOU
2774-131722-0086 FOR EDISON'S METHODS ALWAYS ICONOCLASTIC WHEN PROGRESS IS IN SIGHT WERE PARTICULARLY SO AT THE PERIOD IN QUESTION IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT EDISON'S SCRAP HEAP CONTAINS THE ELEMENTS OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION
2774-131722-0087 INTERESTING AS IT MIGHT BE TO FOLLOW AT LENGTH THE NUMEROUS PHASES OF INGENIOUS AND RESOURCEFUL DEVELOPMENT THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THOSE BUSY YEARS THE LIMIT OF PRESENT SPACE FORBIDS THEIR RELATION IT WOULD HOWEVER BE DENYING THE JUSTICE THAT IS EDISON'S DUE TO OMIT ALL MENTION OF TWO HITHERTO UNNAMED ITEMS
2774-131722-0088 IN PARTICULAR THAT HAVE ADDED TO THE WORLD'S STORE OF USEFUL DEVICES WE REFER FIRST TO THE GREAT TRAVELLING HOISTING CRANE HAVING A SPAN OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN FEET AND USED FOR HOISTING LOADS EQUAL TO TEN TONS THIS BEING THE LARGEST OF THE KIND MADE UP TO THAT TIME
2774-131722-0089 AND AFTERWARD USED AS A MODEL BY MANY OTHERS THE SECOND ITEM WAS THE INGENIOUS AND VARIED FORMS OF CONVEYOR BELT DEVISED AND USED BY EDISON AT THE CONCENTRATING WORKS AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED INTO A SEPARATE AND EXTENSIVE BUSINESS BY AN ENGINEER TO WHOM HE GAVE PERMISSION TO USE HIS PLANS AND PATTERNS
2774-131722-0090 EDISON'S NATIVE SHREWDNESS AND KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE WAS PUT TO PRACTICAL USE IN THE BUSY DAYS OF PLANT CONSTRUCTION IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP MECHANICS ON ACCOUNT OF INDIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATIONS AFFORDED BY THE TINY VILLAGE REMOTE FROM CIVILIZATION AMONG THE CENTRAL MOUNTAINS OF NEW JERSEY
2774-131722-0091 AS SETTLERS IN THE ARTIFICIAL YOSEMITE HE WAS CREATING WE OWE TO MISTER MALLORY A CHARACTERISTIC STORY OF THIS PERIOD AS TO AN INCIDENTAL UNBENDING FROM TOIL WHICH IN ITSELF ILLUSTRATES THE EVER PRESENT DETERMINATION TO CONQUER WHAT IS UNDERTAKEN
2774-131722-0092 ALONG IN THE LATTER PART OF THE NINETIES WHEN THE WORK ON THE PROBLEM OF CONCENTRATING IRON ORE WAS IN PROGRESS IT BECAME NECESSARY WHEN LEAVING THE PLANT AT EDISON TO WAIT OVER AT LAKE HOPATCONG
2774-131722-0093 I TOOK OFF THE CLOTH GOT OUT THE BALLS PICKED OUT A CUE FOR MISTER EDISON AND WHEN WE BANKED FOR THE FIRST SHOT I WON AND STARTED THE GAME AFTER MAKING TWO OR THREE SHOTS I MISSED AND A LONG CAROM SHOT WAS LEFT FOR MISTER EDISON THE CUE BALL AND OBJECT BALL BEING WITHIN ABOUT TWELVE INCHES OF EACH OTHER
2774-131722-0094 I CONTINUED AT HIS REQUEST TO PUT THE BALLS BACK IN THE SAME POSITION FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES
2774-131722-0095 HAVING TAKEN A SOMEWHAT SUPERFICIAL SURVEY OF THE GREAT ENTERPRISE UNDER CONSIDERATION
2774-131722-0096 IN THE MAKING OF A MARKETABLE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE TEST AT THE CRANE FURNACE LET US REVERT TO THAT DEMONSTRATION AND NOTE THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED
2774-131722-0097 IT WAS OF SUCH RICH CHARACTER THAT BEING CHEAPLY MINED BY GREATLY IMPROVED AND INEXPENSIVE METHODS
2774-131722-0098 THUS WAS SWEPT AWAY THE POSSIBILITY OF REAPING THE REWARD SO RICHLY EARNED BY YEARS OF INCESSANT THOUGHT LABOR AND CARE THIS GREAT AND NOTABLE PLANT REPRESENTING A VERY LARGE OUTLAY OF MONEY BROUGHT TO COMPLETION
2774-131722-0099 READY FOR BUSINESS AND EMBRACING SOME OF THE MOST BRILLIANT AND REMARKABLE OF EDISON'S INVENTIONS AND METHODS MUST BE ABANDONED BY FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH HE HAD NO CONTROL AND WITH IT MUST DIE THE HIGH HOPES THAT HIS PROGRESSIVE CONQUERING MARCH TO SUCCESS HAD LEGITIMATELY ENGENDERED
2774-131722-0100 THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF THESE ENTERPRISES IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND FORGOTTEN IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS OF MORE THAN USUAL IMPORT AND SERIOUSNESS AS EDISON WAS VIRTUALLY HIS OWN BACKER PUTTING INTO THE COMPANY ALMOST THE WHOLE OF ALL THE FORTUNE HIS INVENTIONS HAD BROUGHT HIM
2774-131722-0101 AND TO INSIST THAT IT SHALL HAVE BARELY THE LEGAL RATE OF INTEREST AND FAR LESS THAN THE RETURN OF OVER THE COUNTER RETAIL TRADE IT IS AN ABSOLUTE FACT THAT THE GREAT ELECTRICAL INVENTORS AND THE MEN WHO STOOD BEHIND THEM HAVE HAD LITTLE RETURN FOR THEIR FORESIGHT AND COURAGE IN THIS INSTANCE
2774-131722-0102 WHEN THE INVENTOR WAS LARGELY HIS OWN FINANCIER THE DIFFICULTIES AND PERILS WERE REDOUBLED LET MISTER MALLORY GIVE AN INSTANCE DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE PANIC OF EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE THERE CAME A PERIOD WHEN WE WERE VERY HARD UP FOR READY CASH
2774-131722-0103 DUE LARGELY TO THE PANICKY CONDITIONS AND A LARGE PAY ROLL HAD BEEN RAISED WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY A SHORT TIME BEFORE PAY DAY OUR TREASURER CALLED ME UP BY TELEPHONE AND SAID
2774-131722-0104 I HAVE JUST RECEIVED THE PAID CHECKS FROM THE BANK AND I AM FEARFUL THAT MY ASSISTANT WHO HAS FORGED MY NAME TO SOME OF THE CHECKS HAS ABSCONDED WITH ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO MISTER EDISON AND TOLD HIM OF THE FORGERY AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TAKEN AND IN WHAT AN EMBARRASSING POSITION WE WERE FOR THE NEXT PAY ROLL
2774-131722-0105 WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE SAID IT IS TOO BAD THE MONEY IS GONE BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO GO AND SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANK WHICH PAID THE FORGED CHECKS GET HIM TO ADMIT THE BANK'S LIABILITY AND THEN SAY TO HIM THAT MISTER EDISON DOES NOT THINK THE BANK SHOULD SUFFER BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO HAVE A DISHONEST CLERK
2774-131722-0106 IN HIS EMPLOY ALSO SAY TO HIM THAT I SHALL NOT ASK THEM TO MAKE THE AMOUNT GOOD THIS WAS DONE THE BANK ADMITTING ITS LIABILITY AND BEING MUCH PLEASED WITH THIS ACTION WHEN I REPORTED TO MISTER EDISON HE SAID THAT'S ALL RIGHT
2774-131722-0107 WE HAVE MADE A FRIEND OF THE BANK AND WE MAY NEED FRIENDS LATER ON AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT SOME TIME AFTERWARD WHEN WE GREATLY NEEDED HELP IN THE WAY OF LOANS
2774-131722-0108 THIS IRON ORE CONCENTRATING PROJECT HAD LAIN CLOSE TO EDISON'S HEART AND AMBITION INDEED IT HAD PERMEATED HIS WHOLE BEING TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALMOST ALL OTHER INVESTIGATIONS OR INVENTIONS FOR A WHILE FOR FIVE YEARS HE HAD LIVED AND WORKED STEADILY AT EDISON
2774-131722-0109 TO FOLLOW HIS NATURAL BENT IN BEING SURROUNDED DAY AND NIGHT BY HIS RESPONSIBLE CHOSEN ASSOCIATES WITH WHOM HE WORKED UNINTERRUPTED BY OUTSIDERS FROM EARLY MORNING AWAY INTO THE LATE HOURS OF THE EVENING THOSE WHO WERE LABORING WITH HIM INSPIRED BY HIS UNFLAGGING ENTHUSIASM
2774-131722-0110 THE CONCENTRATING WORKS HAD BEEN IN OPERATION AND WE HAD PRODUCED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THE BRIQUETTES AND HAD BEEN ABLE TO SELL ONLY A PORTION OF THEM THE IRON MARKET BEING IN SUCH CONDITION THAT BLAST FURNACES WERE NOT MAKING ANY NEW PURCHASES OF IRON ORE
2774-131722-0111 AND WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY TO RECEIVE AND CONSUME THE ORES WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CONTRACTED FOR SO WHAT SALES WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE WERE AT EXTREMELY LOW PRICES
2774-131722-0112 AND IT WAS WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE RELUCTANCE THAT MISTER EDISON WAS ABLE TO COME FINALLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
2774-131722-0113 WHEN THIS DECISION WAS REACHED MISTER EDISON AND I TOOK THE JERSEY CENTRAL TRAIN FROM EDISON BOUND FOR ORANGE AND I DID NOT LOOK FORWARD TO THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WITH ANY DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE AS THE CONCENTRATING PLANT WAS HEAVILY IN DEBT WITHOUT ANY EARLY PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE TO PAY OFF ITS INDEBTEDNESS
2774-131722-0114 AS WE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE CONCENTRATING PROBLEM WE MUST IF POSSIBLE APPLY IT TO SOME PRACTICAL USE AND AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST WORK OUT SOME OTHER PLANS BY WHICH WE COULD MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY OFF THE CONCENTRATING COMPANY'S INDEBTEDNESS
2774-131722-0115 MISTER EDISON STATING MOST POSITIVELY THAT NO COMPANY WITH WHICH HE HAD PERSONALLY BEEN ACTIVELY CONNECTED HAD EVER FAILED TO PAY ITS DEBTS AND HE DID NOT PROPOSE TO HAVE THE CONCENTRATING COMPANY ANY EXCEPTION
2774-131722-0116 AND WHICH MIGHT PROVE PROFITABLE WE FIGURED CAREFULLY OVER THE PROBABILITIES OF FINANCIAL RETURNS FROM THE PHONOGRAPH WORKS AND OTHER ENTERPRISES
2774-131722-0117 FOR MANUFACTURING PORTLAND CEMENT AND THAT MISTER EDISON WOULD DEVOTE HIS ATTENTION TO THE DEVELOPING OF A STORAGE BATTERY WHICH DID NOT USE LEAD AND SULPHURIC ACID SO THESE TWO LINES OF WORK WERE TAKEN UP BY MISTER EDISON WITH JUST AS MUCH ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY AS IS USUAL WITH HIM
2774-131722-0118 AND ONLY ONCE DID I HEAR HIM MAKE ANY REFERENCE TO THE FINANCIAL LOSS WHICH HE HIMSELF MADE AND HE THEN SAID AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I CAN ANY TIME GET A JOB AT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH AS A TELEGRAPHER AND THAT WILL AMPLY TAKE CARE OF ALL MY PERSONAL REQUIREMENTS
2774-131722-0119 HE STARTED IN WITH THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ENTHUSIASM AND AMBITION AND IN THE COURSE OF ABOUT THREE YEARS WE SUCCEEDED IN PAYING OFF ALL THE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE CONCENTRATING WORKS WHICH AMOUNTED TO SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
2774-131722-0120 AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH WE HAD ACQUIRED AT SO GREAT A COST IT WILL HAVE BEEN GATHERED THAT THE FUNDS FOR THIS GREAT EXPERIMENT WERE FURNISHED LARGELY BY EDISON IN FACT OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS WERE SPENT IN THE ATTEMPT
2774-131722-0121 EDISON'S PHILOSOPHIC VIEW OF AFFAIRS IS GIVEN IN THE FOLLOWING ANECDOTE FROM MISTER MALLORY
