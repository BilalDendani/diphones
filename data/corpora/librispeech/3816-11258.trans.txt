3816-11258-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE ON CLERICAL SNOBS AND SNOBBISHNESS DEAR MISTER SNOB AN AMIABLE YOUNG CORRESPONDENT WRITES WHO SIGNS HIMSELF SNOBLING
3816-11258-0001 THE PARSON IN QUESTION NOT SEEING OLD SMITH PRESENT WOULD HAVE SENT OFF THE BEADLE IN A CAB TO LET THE OLD GENTLEMAN KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WOULD HAVE DELAYED THE SERVICE UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF SMITH SENIOR
3816-11258-0002 HE VERY LIKELY THINKS IT HIS DUTY TO ASK ALL MARRIAGEABLE YOUNG LADIES WHO COME WITHOUT THEIR PAPA WHY THEIR PARENT IS ABSENT AND NO DOUBT ALWAYS SENDS OFF THE BEADLE FOR THAT MISSING GOVERNOR
3816-11258-0003 TO SEND OFF RATTAN IN A HACK CAB TO FETCH ME IN EITHER OF WHICH CASES YOU SEE DEAR SNOBLING THAT THOUGH THE PARSON WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AUTHORISED YET HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXCUSED FOR INTERFERING
3816-11258-0004 HE HAS NO MORE RIGHT TO STOP MY MARRIAGE THAN TO STOP MY DINNER TO BOTH OF WHICH AS A FREE BORN BRITON I AM ENTITLED BY LAW IF I CAN PAY FOR THEM BUT CONSIDER PASTORAL SOLICITUDE
3816-11258-0005 A DEEP SENSE OF THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE AND PARDON THIS INCONVENIENT BUT GENUINE ZEAL BUT IF THE CLERGYMAN DID IN THE DUKE'S CASE WHAT HE WOULD NOT DO IN SMITH'S
3816-11258-0006 IF HE HAS NO MORE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE COEURDELION FAMILY THAN I HAVE WITH THE ROYAL AND SERENE HOUSE OF SAXE COBURG GOTHA THEN I CONFESS MY DEAR SNOBLING YOUR QUESTION MIGHT ELICIT A DISAGREEABLE REPLY
3816-11258-0007 AND ONE WHICH I RESPECTFULLY DECLINE TO GIVE I WONDER WHAT SIR GEORGE TUFTO WOULD SAY IF A SENTRY LEFT HIS POST BECAUSE A NOBLE LORD NOT THE LEAST CONNECTED WITH THE SERVICE BEGGED THE SENTINEL NOT TO DO HIS DUTY
3816-11258-0008 ALAS THAT THE BEADLE WHO CANES LITTLE BOYS AND DRIVES THEM OUT CANNOT DRIVE WORLDLINESS OUT TOO WHAT IS WORLDLINESS BUT SNOBBISHNESS
3816-11258-0009 WHEN FOR INSTANCE I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS THAT THE RIGHT REVEREND THE LORD CHARLES JAMES ADMINISTERED THE RITE OF CONFIRMATION TO A PARTY OF THE JUVENILE NOBILITY AT THE CHAPEL ROYAL
3816-11258-0010 WHOSE INHERITANCE IS DIVIDED AMONGST US I HEREBY CALL UPON ALL DUKES EARLS BARONETS AND OTHER POTENTATES NOT TO LEND THEMSELVES TO THIS SHAMEFUL SCANDAL AND ERROR
3816-11258-0011 TO THE EXCLUSION OF ANY OTHER YOUNG CHRISTIAN THE WHICH DECLARATION IF THEIR LORDSHIPS ARE INDUCED TO MAKE A GREAT LAPIS OFFENSIONIS WILL BE REMOVED AND THE SNOB PAPERS WILL NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN VAIN
3816-11258-0012 WHO HAVING HAD OCCASION TO OBLIGE THAT EXCELLENT PRELATE THE BISHOP OF BULLOCKSMITHY ASKED HIS LORDSHIP IN RETURN TO CONFIRM HIS CHILDREN PRIVATELY IN HIS LORDSHIP'S OWN CHAPEL
3816-11258-0013 IT IS AS IF A MAN WOULDN'T GO TO HEAVEN UNLESS HE WENT IN A SPECIAL TRAIN OR AS IF HE THOUGHT AS SOME PEOPLE THINK ABOUT VACCINATION CONFIRMATION MORE EFFECTUAL WHEN ADMINISTERED AT FIRST HAND
3816-11258-0014 THIS IS ONLY A LITTLE MORE OPENLY AND UNDISGUISEDLY SNOBBISH THAN THE CASES BEFORE ALLUDED TO A WELL BRED SNOB IS JUST AS SECRETLY PROUD OF HIS RICHES AND HONOURS AS A PARVENU SNOB
3816-11258-0015 WHO MAKES THE MOST LUDICROUS EXHIBITION OF THEM AND A HIGH BORN MARCHIONESS OR DUCHESS JUST AS VAIN OF HERSELF AND HER DIAMONDS AS QUEEN QUASHYBOO
3816-11258-0016 IT IS NOT OUT OF DISRESPECT TO MY PEERAGE WHICH I LOVE AND HONOUR INDEED HAVE I NOT SAID BEFORE THAT I SHOULD BE READY TO JUMP OUT OF MY SKIN IF TWO DUKES WOULD WALK DOWN PALL MALL WITH ME
3816-11258-0017 IT IS NOT OUT OF DISRESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I WISH THESE TITLES HAD NEVER BEEN INVENTED BUT CONSIDER IF THERE WERE NO TREE THERE WOULD BE NO SHADOW AND HOW MUCH MORE HONEST SOCIETY WOULD BE
3816-11258-0018 AND HOW MUCH MORE SERVICEABLE THE CLERGY WOULD BE WHICH IS OUR PRESENT CONSIDERATION IF THESE TEMPTATIONS OF RANK AND CONTINUAL BAITS OF WORLDLINESS WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE AND PERPETUALLY THROWN OUT TO LEAD THEM ASTRAY
3816-11258-0019 I HAVE SEEN MANY EXAMPLES OF THEIR FALLING AWAY WHEN FOR INSTANCE TOM SNIFFLE FIRST WENT INTO THE COUNTRY AS CURATE FOR MISTER FUDDLESTON SIR HUDDLESTON FUDDLESTON'S BROTHER WHO RESIDED ON SOME OTHER LIVING
3816-11258-0020 THERE COULD NOT BE A MORE KIND HARDWORKING AND EXCELLENT CREATURE THAN TOM HE HAD HIS AUNT TO LIVE WITH HIM HIS CONDUCT TO HIS POOR WAS ADMIRABLE HE WROTE ANNUALLY REAMS OF THE BEST INTENTIONED AND VAPID SERMONS
3816-11258-0021 WHEN LORD BRANDYBALL'S FAMILY CAME DOWN INTO THE COUNTRY AND INVITED HIM TO DINE AT BRANDYBALL PARK SNIFFLE WAS SO AGITATED THAT HE ALMOST FORGOT HOW TO SAY GRACE AND UPSET A BOWL OF CURRANT JELLY SAUCE
3816-11258-0022 IN LADY FANNY TOFFY'S LAP WHAT WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS INTIMACY WITH THAT NOBLE FAMILY HE QUARRELLED WITH HIS AUNT FOR DINING OUT EVERY NIGHT THE WRETCH FORGOT HIS POOR ALTOGETHER
3816-11258-0023 AND KILLED HIS OLD NAG BY ALWAYS RIDING OVER TO BRANDYBALL WHERE HE REVELLED IN THE MADDEST PASSION FOR LADY FANNY HE ORDERED THE NEATEST NEW CLOTHES AND ECCLESIASTICAL WAISTCOATS FROM LONDON HE APPEARED WITH CORAZZA SHIRTS
3816-11258-0024 LACKERED BOOTS AND PERFUMERY HE BOUGHT A BLOOD HORSE FROM BOB TOFFY WAS SEEN AT ARCHERY MEETINGS PUBLIC BREAKFASTS ACTUALLY AT COVER AND I BLUSH TO SAY THAT I SAW HIM IN A STALL AT THE OPERA
3816-11258-0025 AND AFTERWARDS RIDING BY LADY FANNY'S SIDE IN ROTTEN ROW HE DOUBLE BARRELLED HIS NAME AS MANY POOR SNOBS DO AND INSTEAD OF T SNIFFLE AS FORMERLY CAME OUT IN A PORCELAIN CARD AS
3816-11258-0026 TO THE INEXPRESSIBLE GRIEF OF HIS SON LORD ALICOMPAYNE AND UTTERED THAT REMARKABLE SPEECH TO SNIFFLE WHICH DISPOSED OF THE CLAIMS OF THE LATTER IF I DIDN'T RESPECT THE CHURCH SIR HIS LORDSHIP SAID
3816-11258-0027 BY JOVE I'D KICK YOU DOWNSTAIRS HIS LORDSHIP THEN FELL BACK INTO THE FIT AFORESAID AND LADY FANNY AS WE ALL KNOW
3816-11258-0028 AS FOR POOR TOM HE WAS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN DEBT AS WELL AS IN LOVE HIS CREDITORS CAME DOWN UPON HIM MISTER HEMP OF PORTUGAL STREET PROCLAIMED HIS NAME LATELY AS A REVEREND OUTLAW
3816-11258-0029 AND HE HAS BEEN SEEN AT VARIOUS FOREIGN WATERING PLACES SOMETIMES DOING DUTY SOMETIMES COACHING A STRAY GENTLEMAN'S SON AT CARLSRUHE OR KISSINGEN SOMETIMES MUST WE SAY IT
3816-11258-0030 LURKING ABOUT THE ROULETTE TABLES WITH A TUFT TO HIS CHIN IF TEMPTATION HAD NOT COME UPON THIS UNHAPPY FELLOW IN THE SHAPE OF A LORD BRANDYBALL HE MIGHT STILL HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING HIS PROFESSION HUMBLY AND WORTHILY
3816-11258-0031 AND EKED OUT HIS INCOME AND LIVED AND DIED A COUNTRY PARSON COULD HE HAVE DONE BETTER YOU WHO WANT TO KNOW HOW GREAT AND GOOD AND NOBLE SUCH A CHARACTER MAY BE
