8778-246972-0000 THE SOIL OF THE WORLD HE WAS WITHERING AWAY OUT OF IT ERE LONG SYMPTOMS APPEARED WHICH NO ONE COULD WELL MISTAKE AND LINGARD HIMSELF KNEW THAT HE WAS DYING
8778-246972-0001 WINGFOLD HAD DREADED THAT HIS DISCOVERY OF THE FACT MIGHT REVEAL
8778-246972-0002 AND THAT WHEN HE FOUND IT DENIED HIM HE WOULD FALL INTO DESPAIR
8778-246972-0003 AND HIS BEARING LEFT NO GROUND FOR ANXIETY A GLEAM OF GLADNESS FROM BELOW THE HORIZON OF HIS SPIRIT SHOT UP LIKE THE AURORA OF A HEAVENLY MORNING OVER THE SKY OF HIS COUNTENANCE
8778-246972-0004 HE GLANCED AT HIS FRIEND SMILED AND SAID IT HAS KILLED ME TOO AND THAT IS A COMFORT THE CURATE ONLY LOOKED HIS REPLY THEY SAY RESUMED LEOPOLD AFTER A WHILE
8778-246972-0005 I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THEY WERE FOOLING ME I KNOW IT NOW BUT WHAT CAN I DO I AM SO WEAK I SHOULD ONLY DIE ON THE WAY HE TRIED TO RISE BUT FELL BACK IN THE CHAIR
8778-246972-0006 OH HE SIGHED ISN'T IT GOOD OF GOD TO LET ME DIE WHO KNOWS WHAT HE MAY DO FOR ME ON THE OTHER SIDE
8778-246972-0007 MITIGATING THE HARSHNESS OF HIS JUDGMENT OF HIMSELF WINGFOLD'S BUSINESS WAS TO START HIM WELL IN THE WORLD WHITHER HE WAS GOING
8778-246972-0008 THAT HER DARLING MUST DIE YET WAS THERE NO SMALL CONSOLATION MINGLED WITH THE SHOCK FEAR VANISHED AND LOVE RETURNED WITH GRIEF IN TWOFOLD STRENGTH SHE FLEW TO HIM AND SHE
8778-246972-0009 WHO HAD BEEN SO SELF CONTAINED SO COMPOSED SO UNSUBMISSIVE TO ANY SWAY OF FEELING BROKE INTO SUCH A STORM OF PASSIONATE AFFECTION THAT THE VEXILLA MORTIS ANSWERED FROM HIS BOSOM
8778-246972-0010 FLAUNTING THEMSELVES IN CRIMSON BEFORE HER EYES IN VAIN FOR LEOPOLD'S SAKE THE CURATE HAD SOUGHT TO QUIET HER SHE HAD RESENTED HIS INTERFERENCE
8778-246972-0011 BUT THIS RESULT OF HER IMPETUOSITY SPEEDILY BROUGHT HER TO HER SENSES AND SET HER TO SUBDUE HERSELF THE SAME EVENING LEOPOLD INSISTED ON DICTATING TO THE CURATE HIS CONFESSION
8778-246972-0012 WHICH DONE HE SIGNED IT MAKING HIM AND HELEN ATTEST THE SIGNATURE THIS DOCUMENT WINGFOLD TOOK CHARGE OF PROMISING TO MAKE THE RIGHT USE OF IT WHATEVER HE SHOULD ON REFLECTION CONCLUDE THAT TO BE
8778-246972-0013 SEEMED AT EASE HIS SUFFERINGS FROM COUGH AND WEAKNESS AND FEVER NOW AUGMENTED WITH GREATER RAPIDITY BUT IT WAS PLAIN FROM THE KIND OF LIGHT IN HIS EYE
8778-246972-0014 AND THE FAR LOOK WHICH WAS NOT YET RETROSPECTIVE THAT HOPE AND EXPECTATION WERE HIGH IN HIM HE HAD HIS TIMES OF GLOOM WHEN THE DRAGON OF THE PAST CREPT OUT OF ITS CAVE AND TORE HIM AFRESH
8778-246972-0015 BUT THE PROSPECT OF COMING DELIVERANCE STRENGTHENED HIM DO YOU REALLY THINK HE SAID ONCE TO THE CURATE THAT I SHALL EVER SEE EMMELINE AGAIN TRULY I HOPE SO
8778-246972-0016 AND COULD ARGUE UPON THE POINT BUT I THINK THE BEST WAY WHEN DOUBT COMES AS TO ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TRUE IS JUST TO HIDE YOURSELF IN GOD
8778-246972-0017 AS THE CHILD WOULD HIDE FROM THE DARK IN THE FOLDS OF HIS MOTHER'S MANTLE BUT AUNT WOULD SAY IF SHE KNEW THAT DYING AS SHE DID EMMELINE COULD NOT BE SAVED
8778-246972-0018 MAY HAVE TO BE A GOOD DEAL ASTONISHED
8778-246972-0019 RETURNED THE CURATE BUT NEVER MIND WHAT PEOPLE SAY
8778-246972-0020 HIS FATHER TO BE A FAITHFUL CREATOR NEEDS A MIGHT OF TRUTH AND LOVING KINDNESS OF WHICH OUR NARROW HEARTS CAN ILL CONCEIVE ASK MUCH OF GOD MY BOY
8778-246972-0021 AND BE VERY HUMBLE AND VERY HOPING
8778-246972-0022 LEOPOLD WOULD LOOK HIS THANKS AND HOLD HIS PEACE I WISH IT WAS OVER HE SAID ONCE SO DO I RETURNED THE CURATE BUT BE OF GOOD COURAGE I THINK NOTHING WILL BE GIVEN YOU TO BEAR
8778-246972-0023 YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BEAR
8778-246972-0024 I DON'T THINK I SHALL EVER COMPLAIN THAT WOULD BE TO TAKE MYSELF OUT OF HIS HANDS AND I HAVE NO HOPE ANYWHERE ELSE ARE YOU ANY SURER ABOUT HIM SIR THAN YOU USED TO BE
8778-246972-0025 I WOULD NOT BE OUT OF A DOUBT OR DIFFICULTY AN HOUR SOONER THAN HE WOULD TAKE ME
