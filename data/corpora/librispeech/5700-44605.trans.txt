5700-44605-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY ONE MAKING CONVERSATION EFFECTIVE
5700-44605-0001 IN CONVERSATION AVOID THE EXTREMES OF FORWARDNESS AND RESERVE
5700-44605-0002 EMERSON ESSAYS CIRCLES THE FATHER OF W E GLADSTONE CONSIDERED CONVERSATION TO BE BOTH AN ART AND AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AROUND THE DINNER TABLE IN HIS HOME SOME TOPIC OF LOCAL OR NATIONAL INTEREST
5700-44605-0003 OR SOME DEBATED QUESTION WAS CONSTANTLY BEING DISCUSSED IN THIS WAY A FRIENDLY RIVALRY FOR SUPREMACY IN CONVERSATION AROSE AMONG THE FAMILY AND AN INCIDENT OBSERVED IN THE STREET AN IDEA GLEANED FROM A BOOK
5700-44605-0004 A DEDUCTION FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WAS CAREFULLY STORED AS MATERIAL FOR THE FAMILY EXCHANGE THUS HIS EARLY YEARS OF PRACTISE IN ELEGANT CONVERSATION PREPARED THE YOUNGER GLADSTONE FOR HIS CAREER AS A LEADER AND SPEAKER
5700-44605-0005 THERE IS A SENSE IN WHICH THE ABILITY TO CONVERSE EFFECTIVELY IS EFFICIENT PUBLIC SPEAKING FOR OUR CONVERSATION IS OFTEN HEARD BY MANY AND OCCASIONALLY DECISIONS OF GREAT MOMENT HINGE UPON THE TONE AND QUALITY
5700-44605-0006 OF WHAT WE SAY IN PRIVATE INDEED CONVERSATION IN THE AGGREGATE PROBABLY WIELDS MORE POWER THAN PRESS AND PLATFORM COMBINED SOCRATES TAUGHT HIS GREAT TRUTHS
5700-44605-0007 NOT FROM PUBLIC ROSTRUMS BUT IN PERSONAL CONVERSE MEN MADE PILGRIMAGES TO GOETHE'S LIBRARY AND COLERIDGE'S HOME TO BE CHARMED AND INSTRUCTED BY THEIR SPEECH
5700-44605-0008 AND THE CULTURE OF MANY NATIONS WAS IMMEASURABLY INFLUENCED BY THE THOUGHTS THAT STREAMED OUT FROM THOSE RICH WELL SPRINGS MOST OF THE WORLD MOVING SPEECHES ARE MADE IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION CONFERENCES OF DIPLOMATS
5700-44605-0009 BUSINESS GETTING ARGUMENTS DECISIONS BY BOARDS OF DIRECTORS CONSIDERATIONS OF CORPORATE POLICY ALL OF WHICH INFLUENCE THE POLITICAL MERCANTILE AND ECONOMIC MAPS OF THE WORLD ARE USUALLY THE RESULTS OF CAREFUL THOUGH INFORMAL CONVERSATION
5700-44605-0010 AND THE MAN WHOSE OPINIONS WEIGH IN SUCH CRISES IS HE WHO HAS FIRST CAREFULLY PONDERED THE WORDS OF BOTH ANTAGONIST AND PROTAGONIST HOWEVER IMPORTANT IT MAY BE TO ATTAIN SELF CONTROL IN LIGHT SOCIAL CONVERSE
5700-44605-0011 OR ABOUT THE FAMILY TABLE IT IS UNDENIABLY VITAL TO HAVE ONESELF PERFECTLY IN HAND WHILE TAKING PART IN A MOMENTOUS CONFERENCE THEN THE HINTS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN ON POISE ALERTNESS PRECISION OF WORD
5700-44605-0012 CLEARNESS OF STATEMENT AND FORCE OF UTTERANCE WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC SPEECH ARE EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO CONVERSATION THE FORM OF NERVOUS EGOTISM FOR IT IS BOTH
5700-44605-0013 THAT SUDDENLY ENDS IN FLUSTERS JUST WHEN THE VITAL WORDS NEED TO BE UTTERED IS THE SIGN OF COMING DEFEAT FOR A CONVERSATION IS OFTEN A CONTEST IF YOU FEEL THIS TENDENCY EMBARRASSING YOU BE SURE TO LISTEN TO HOLMES'S ADVICE
5700-44605-0014 AND WHEN YOU STICK ON CONVERSATIONAL BURS DON'T STREW YOUR PATHWAY WITH THOSE DREADFUL URS
5700-44605-0015 HERE BRING YOUR WILL INTO ACTION FOR YOUR TROUBLE IS A WANDERING ATTENTION YOU MUST FORCE YOUR MIND TO PERSIST ALONG THE CHOSEN LINE OF CONVERSATION AND RESOLUTELY REFUSE TO BE DIVERTED BY ANY SUBJECT OR HAPPENING
5700-44605-0016 THAT MAY UNEXPECTEDLY POP UP TO DISTRACT YOU TO FAIL HERE IS TO LOSE EFFECTIVENESS UTTERLY CONCENTRATION IS THE KEYNOTE OF CONVERSATIONAL CHARM AND EFFICIENCY THE HAPHAZARD HABIT OF EXPRESSION THAT USES BIRD SHOT
5700-44605-0017 WHEN A BULLET IS NEEDED INSURES MISSING THE GAME FOR DIPLOMACY OF ALL SORTS RESTS UPON THE PRECISE APPLICATION OF PRECISE WORDS PARTICULARLY IF ONE MAY PARAPHRASE TALLYRAND
5700-44605-0018 A TURN ABOUT EXCHANGE OF IDEAS YET MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO REGARD IT AS A MONOLOGUE BRONSON ALCOTT USED TO SAY THAT MANY COULD ARGUE BUT FEW CONVERSE THE FIRST THING TO REMEMBER IN CONVERSATION THEN
5700-44605-0019 IS THAT LISTENING RESPECTFUL SYMPATHETIC ALERT LISTENING IS NOT ONLY DUE TO OUR FELLOW CONVERSER BUT DUE TO OURSELVES MANY A REPLY LOSES ITS POINT BECAUSE THE SPEAKER IS SO MUCH INTERESTED IN WHAT HE IS ABOUT TO SAY
5700-44605-0020 THAT IT IS REALLY NO REPLY AT ALL BUT MERELY AN IRRITATING AND HUMILIATING IRRELEVANCY SELF EXPRESSION IS EXHILARATING THIS EXPLAINS THE ETERNAL IMPULSE TO DECORATE TOTEM POLES AND PAINT PICTURES
5700-44605-0021 WRITE POETRY AND EXPOUND PHILOSOPHY ONE OF THE CHIEF DELIGHTS OF CONVERSATION IS THE OPPORTUNITY IT AFFORDS FOR SELF EXPRESSION A GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST WHO MONOPOLIZES ALL THE CONVERSATION WILL BE VOTED A BORE
5700-44605-0022 BECAUSE HE DENIES OTHERS THE ENJOYMENT OF SELF EXPRESSION WHILE A MEDIOCRE TALKER WHO LISTENS INTERESTEDLY MAY BE CONSIDERED A GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST BECAUSE HE PERMITS HIS COMPANIONS TO PLEASE THEMSELVES THROUGH SELF EXPRESSION
5700-44605-0023 THEY ARE PRAISED WHO PLEASE THEY PLEASE WHO LISTEN WELL THE FIRST STEP IN REMEDYING HABITS OF CONFUSION IN MANNER AWKWARD BEARING VAGUENESS IN THOUGHT AND LACK OF PRECISION IN UTTERANCE
5700-44605-0024 IS TO RECOGNIZE YOUR FAULTS IF YOU ARE SERENELY UNCONSCIOUS OF THEM NO ONE LEAST OF ALL YOURSELF CAN HELP YOU BUT ONCE DIAGNOSE YOUR OWN WEAKNESSES AND YOU CAN OVERCOME THEM BY DOING FOUR THINGS ONE
5700-44605-0025 WILL TO OVERCOME THEM AND KEEP ON WILLING TWO HOLD YOURSELF IN HAND BY ASSURING YOURSELF THAT YOU KNOW PRECISELY WHAT YOU OUGHT TO SAY IF YOU CANNOT DO THAT BE QUIET UNTIL YOU ARE CLEAR ON THIS VITAL POINT
5700-44605-0026 THREE HAVING THUS ASSURED YOURSELF CAST OUT THE FEAR OF THOSE WHO LISTEN TO YOU THEY ARE ONLY HUMAN AND WILL RESPECT YOUR WORDS IF YOU REALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY AND SAY IT BRIEFLY SIMPLY AND CLEARLY
5700-44605-0027 FOUR HAVE THE COURAGE TO STUDY THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE UNTIL YOU ARE MASTER OF AT LEAST ITS SIMPLER FORMS
5700-44605-0028 CONVERSATIONAL HINTS CHOOSE SOME SUBJECT THAT WILL PROVE OF GENERAL INTEREST TO THE WHOLE GROUP DO NOT EXPLAIN THE MECHANISM OF A GAS ENGINE AT AN AFTERNOON TEA OR THE CULTURE OF HOLLYHOCKS AT A STAG PARTY
5700-44605-0029 IT IS NOT CONSIDERED GOOD TASTE FOR A MAN TO BARE HIS ARM IN PUBLIC AND SHOW SCARS OR DEFORMITIES IT IS EQUALLY BAD FORM FOR HIM TO FLAUNT HIS OWN WOES OR THE DEFORMITY OF SOME ONE ELSE'S CHARACTER
5700-44605-0030 THE PUBLIC DEMANDS PLAYS AND STORIES THAT END HAPPILY ALL THE WORLD IS SEEKING HAPPINESS THEY CANNOT LONG BE INTERESTED IN YOUR ILLS AND TROUBLES GEORGE COHAN MADE HIMSELF A MILLIONAIRE BEFORE HE WAS THIRTY
5700-44605-0031 BY WRITING CHEERFUL PLAYS ONE OF HIS RULES IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO CONVERSATION ALWAYS LEAVE THEM LAUGHING WHEN YOU SAY GOOD BYE DYNAMITE THE I OUT OF YOUR CONVERSATION
5700-44605-0032 NOT ONE MAN IN NINE HUNDRED AND SEVEN CAN TALK ABOUT HIMSELF WITHOUT BEING A BORE THE MAN WHO CAN PERFORM THAT FEAT CAN ACHIEVE MARVELS WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF SO THE ETERNAL I IS NOT PERMISSIBLE EVEN IN HIS TALK
5700-44605-0033 IF YOU HABITUALLY BUILD YOUR CONVERSATION AROUND YOUR OWN INTERESTS IT MAY PROVE VERY TIRESOME TO YOUR LISTENER HE MAY BE THINKING OF BIRD DOGS OR DRY FLY FISHING
5700-44605-0034 THE CHARMING CONVERSATIONALIST IS PREPARED TO TALK IN TERMS OF HIS LISTENER'S INTEREST IF HIS LISTENER SPENDS HIS SPARE TIME INVESTIGATING GUERNSEY CATTLE OR AGITATING SOCIAL REFORMS
5700-44605-0035 THE DISCRIMINATING CONVERSATIONALIST SHAPES HIS REMARKS ACCORDINGLY RICHARD WASHBURN CHILD SAYS HE KNOWS A MAN OF MEDIOCRE ABILITY WHO CAN CHARM MEN MUCH ABLER THAN HIMSELF WHEN HE DISCUSSES ELECTRIC LIGHTING
5700-44605-0036 THIS SAME MAN PROBABLY WOULD BORE AND BE BORED IF HE WERE FORCED TO CONVERSE ABOUT MUSIC OR MADAGASCAR AVOID PLATITUDES AND HACKNEYED PHRASES
5700-44605-0037 ON STATE STREET OR ON PIKE'S PEAK IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO OBSERVE HOW SMALL THIS WORLD IS AFTER ALL THIS OBSERVATION WAS DOUBTLESS MADE PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF PIKE'S PEAK
5700-44605-0038 THIS OLD WORLD IS GETTING BETTER EVERY DAY FANNER'S WIVES DO NOT HAVE TO WORK AS HARD AS FORMERLY IT IS NOT SO MUCH THE HIGH COST OF LIVING AS THE COST OF HIGH LIVING
