205-159056-0000 ANY LIFE OF WOLFE CAN BE ARTIFICIALLY SIMPLIFIED BY TREATING HIS PURELY MILITARY WORK AS SOMETHING COMPLETE IN ITSELF
205-159056-0001 BUT SINCE SUCH TREATMENT GIVES A TOTALLY FALSE IDEA OF HIS ACHIEVEMENT THIS LITTLE SKETCH DRAWN STRAIGHT FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES TRIES TO SHOW HIM AS HE REALLY WAS A CO WORKER WITH THE BRITISH FLEET IN A WAR BASED ENTIRELY ON NAVAL STRATEGY
205-159056-0002 AND INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
205-159056-0003 MANY OF HIS ANCESTORS HAD STOOD READY TO FIGHT FOR KING AND COUNTRY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE HIS FATHER FOUGHT UNDER THE GREAT DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH IN THE WAR AGAINST FRANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HIS GRANDFATHER HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER HIS ONLY UNCLE
205-159056-0004 NOR HAS THE MARTIAL SPIRIT DESERTED THE DESCENDANTS OF THE WOLFES IN THE GENERATION NOW ALIVE THEY ARE SOLDIERS STILL THE PRESENT HEAD OF THE FAMILY WHO REPRESENTED IT AT THE CELEBRATION OF THE TERCENTENARY OF THE FOUNDING OF QUEBEC
205-159056-0005 FOUGHT IN EGYPT FOR QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE MEMBER OF IT WHO REPRESENTED WOLFE ON THAT OCCASION IN THE PAGEANT OF THE QUEBEC CAMPAIGN
205-159056-0006 ARE OF AN OLD AND HONOURABLE LINE MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO THEIR FOREFATHERS LIVED IN ENGLAND AND LATER ON IN WALES LATER STILL IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY BEFORE AMERICA WAS DISCOVERED THEY WERE LIVING IN IRELAND WOLFE'S FATHER HOWEVER
205-159056-0007 WAS BORN IN ENGLAND AND AS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF HIS ANCESTORS IN IRELAND HAD MARRIED OTHER THAN ENGLISH PROTESTANTS AND AS WOLFE'S MOTHER WAS ALSO ENGLISH WE MAY SAY THAT THE VICTOR OF QUEBEC WAS A PURE BRED ENGLISHMAN
205-159056-0008 AMONG HIS ANGLO IRISH KINSMEN WERE THE GOLDSMITHS AND THE SEYMOURS OLIVER GOLDSMITH HIMSELF
205-159056-0009 WOLFE'S MOTHER TO WHOM HE OWED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS GENIUS WAS A DESCENDANT OF TWO GOOD FAMILIES IN YORKSHIRE SHE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIS FATHER AND WAS VERY TALL AND HANDSOME WOLFE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO ONE LIKE HER
205-159056-0010 WHEN HE WAS A COLONEL AND HAD BEEN THROUGH THE WARS AND AT COURT HE STILL BELIEVED SHE WAS A MATCH FOR ALL THE BEAUTIES HE WAS NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO TAKE AFTER HER IN LOOKS EXCEPT IN HER ONE WEAK FEATURE A CUTAWAY CHIN HIS BODY INDEED
205-159056-0011 WOLFE'S PARENTS WENT TO LIVE AT WESTERHAM IN KENT SHORTLY AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED AND THERE ON JANUARY SECOND SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
205-159056-0012 TWO OTHER HOUSES IN THE LITTLE COUNTRY TOWN OF WESTERHAM ARE FULL OF MEMORIES OF WOLFE ONE OF THESE WAS HIS FATHER'S A HOUSE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS BORN
205-159056-0013 THE SOLDIER WHO WON CANADA FOR ENGLAND IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE SAT UNDER THE ARMS OF THE KING IN WHOSE SERVICE THE SAILOR CABOT HOISTED THE FLAG OF ENGLAND OVER CANADIAN SOIL IN FOURTEEN NINETY SEVEN
205-159056-0014 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE THE OTHER HOUSE IS SQUERRYES COURT BELONGING THEN AND NOW TO THE WARDE FAMILY THE WOLFES CLOSEST FRIENDS WOLFE AND GEORGE WARDE WERE CHUMS FROM THE FIRST DAY THEY MET
205-159056-0015 BOTH WISHED TO GO INTO THE ARMY AND BOTH OF COURSE PLAYED SOLDIERS LIKE OTHER VIRILE BOYS WARDE LIVED TO BE AN OLD MAN AND ACTUALLY DID BECOME A FAMOUS CAVALRY LEADER
205-159056-0016 WHERE HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AT SWINDEN'S HERE HE WORKED QUIETLY ENOUGH TILL JUST BEFORE HE ENTERED ON HIS TEENS THEN THE LONG PENT RAGE OF ENGLAND SUDDENLY BURST IN WAR WITH SPAIN THE PEOPLE WENT WILD WHEN THE BRITISH FLEET TOOK PORTO BELLO
205-159056-0017 A SPANISH PORT IN CENTRAL AMERICA THE NEWS WAS CRIED THROUGH THE STREETS ALL NIGHT THE NOISE OF BATTLE SEEMED TO BE SOUNDING ALL ROUND SWINDEN'S SCHOOL WHERE MOST OF THE BOYS BELONGED TO NAVAL AND MILITARY FAMILIES
205-159056-0018 SHIPS WERE FITTING OUT IN ENGLISH HARBOURS SOLDIERS WERE MARCHING INTO EVERY ENGLISH CAMP CROWDS WERE SINGING AND CHEERING FIRST ONE BOY'S FATHER AND THEN ANOTHER'S WAS UNDER ORDERS FOR THE FRONT AMONG THEM WAS WOLFE'S FATHER
205-159056-0019 TO THE FORCES ASSEMBLING IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT
205-159056-0020 WHEN A WHOLE NATION WAS AFOOT TO FIGHT AND WHO WOULD NOT FIGHT THE SPANIARDS WHEN THEY CUT OFF BRITISH SAILORS EARS THAT WAS AN OLD TALE BY THIS TIME BUT THE FLAMES OF ANGER THREW IT INTO LURID RELIEF ONCE MORE
205-159056-0021 WOLFE WAS DETERMINED TO GO AND FIGHT NOTHING COULD STOP HIM THERE WAS NO COMMISSION FOR HIM AS AN OFFICER NEVER MIND HE WOULD GO AS A VOLUNTEER AND WIN HIS COMMISSION IN THE FIELD SO ONE HOT DAY IN JULY SEVENTEEN FORTY
205-159056-0022 THE LANKY RED HAIRED BOY OF THIRTEEN AND A HALF TOOK HIS SEAT ON THE PORTSMOUTH COACH BESIDE HIS FATHER THE VETERAN SOLDIER OF FIFTY FIVE HIS MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF MUCH TOO FINE A SPIRIT TO GRUDGE ANYTHING FOR THE SERVICE OF HER COUNTRY
205-159056-0023 BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING EXCEPTIONALLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DISEASE FOR A SICKLY BOY IN A FAR OFF LAND OF PESTILENCE AND FEVER SHE HAD WRITTEN TO HIM THE VERY DAY HE LEFT
205-159056-0024 BUT HE FULL OF THE STIR AND EXCITEMENT OF A BIG CAMP HAD CARRIED THE LETTER IN HIS POCKET FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE ANSWERING IT THEN HE WROTE HER THE FIRST OF MANY LETTERS FROM DIFFERENT SEATS OF WAR THE LAST ONE OF ALL BEING WRITTEN JUST BEFORE HE WON THE VICTORY
205-159056-0025 THAT MADE HIM FAMOUS ROUND THE WORLD NEWPORT ISLE OF WIGHT AUGUST SIXTH SEVENTEEN FORTY I RECEIVED MY DEAREST MAMMA'S LETTER ON MONDAY LAST BUT COULD NOT ANSWER IT THEN
205-159056-0026 BY REASON I WAS AT CAMP TO SEE THE REGIMENTS OFF TO GO ON BOARD AND WAS TOO LATE FOR THE POST BUT AM VERY SORRY DEAR MAMMA THAT YOU DOUBT MY LOVE WHICH I'M SURE IS AS SINCERE AS EVER ANY SON'S WAS TO HIS MOTHER
205-159056-0027 PAPA AND I ARE JUST GOING ON BOARD BUT I BELIEVE SHALL NOT SAIL THIS FORTNIGHT IN WHICH TIME IF I CAN GET ASHORE AT PORTSMOUTH OR ANY OTHER TOWN I WILL CERTAINLY WRITE TO YOU AND WHEN WE ARE GONE BY EVERY SHIP WE MEET BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS MY DUTY
205-159056-0028 BESIDES IF IT IS NOT I WOULD DO IT OUT OF LOVE WITH PLEASURE I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT YOUR HEAD IS SO BAD WHICH I FEAR IS CAUSED BY YOUR BEING SO MELANCHOLY BUT PRAY DEAR MAMMA IF YOU LOVE ME DON'T GIVE YOURSELF UP TO FEARS FOR US
205-159056-0029 PRAY MY LOVE TO MY BROTHER PRAY MY SERVICE TO MISTER STRETON AND HIS FAMILY TO MISTER AND MISSUS WESTON AND TO GEORGE WARDE WHEN YOU SEE HIM AND PRAY BELIEVE ME TO BE MY DEAREST MAMMA YOUR MOST DUTIFUL LOVING AND AFFECTIONATE SON
205-159056-0030 J WOLFE TO MISSUS WOLFE AT HER HOUSE IN GREENWICH KENT WOLFE'S VERY GOOD STATE OF HEALTH WAS NOT LIKELY TO CONTINUE SO EITHER IN CAMP OR ON BOARD SHIP
205-159056-0031 A LONG PEACE HAD MADE THE COUNTRY INDIFFERENT TO THE WELFARE OF THE ARMY AND NAVY NOW MEN WERE SUDDENLY BEING MASSED TOGETHER IN CAMPS AND FLEETS AS IF ON PURPOSE TO BREED DISEASE SANITATION ON A LARGE SCALE NEVER HAVING BEEN PRACTISED IN PEACE
205-159056-0032 COULD NOT BE IMPROVISED IN THIS HURRIED THOUGH DISASTROUSLY SLOW PREPARATION FOR A WAR THE SHIP IN WHICH WOLFE WAS TO SAIL HAD BEEN LYING IDLE FOR YEARS AND HER PESTILENTIAL BILGE WATER SOON BEGAN TO MAKE THE SAILORS AND SOLDIERS SICKEN AND DIE
205-159056-0033 MOST FORTUNATELY WOLFE WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO TAKE ILL AND SO HE WAS SENT HOME IN TIME TO SAVE HIM FROM THE FEVERS OF SPANISH AMERICA WOLFE WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIS MOTHER AGAIN TO HAVE HIS PONY TO RIDE AND HIS DOGS TO PLAY WITH
205-159056-0034 BUT THOUGH HE TRIED HIS BEST TO STICK TO HIS LESSONS HIS HEART WAS WILD FOR THE WAR HE AND GEORGE WARDE USED TO GO EVERY DAY DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS BEHIND THE PIGEON HOUSE AT SQUERRYES COURT AND PRACTISE WITH THEIR SWORDS AND PISTOLS
205-159056-0035 INSIDE WAS A COMMISSION AS SECOND LIEUTENANT IN THE MARINES
205-159056-0036 WHEN THE SQUIRE HANDED HIM HIS FIRST COMMISSION AND THERE IT IS TO DAY AND ON IT ARE THE VERSES ENDING THIS SPOT SO SACRED WILL FOREVER CLAIM A PROUD ALLIANCE WITH ITS HERO'S NAME WOLFE WAS AT LAST AN OFFICER
205-159056-0037 BUT THE MARINES WERE NOT THE CORPS FOR HIM THEIR SERVICE COMPANIES WERE FIVE THOUSAND MILES AWAY WHILE WAR WITH FRANCE WAS BREAKING OUT MUCH NEARER HOME SO WHAT WAS HIS DELIGHT AT RECEIVING ANOTHER COMMISSION ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO
205-159056-0038 AS AN ENSIGN IN THE TWELFTH REGIMENT OF FOOT HE WAS NOW FIFTEEN AN OFFICER A SOLDIER BORN AND BRED EAGER TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY AND JUST APPOINTED TO A REGIMENT ORDERED TO THE FRONT
205-159056-0039 WITHIN A MONTH AN ARMY SUCH AS NO ONE HAD SEEN SINCE THE DAYS OF MARLBOROUGH HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED AT BLACKHEATH
205-159056-0040 AND THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND CAME DOWN TO REVIEW THEM
