6426-64290-0023 BUT HERE MARY ALL AT ONCE CAME TO HERSELF AND WAS AWARE THAT SHE WAS IN QUITE A FALSE POSITION SHE WITHDREW THEREFORE TO THE FARTHEST CORNER SAT DOWN CLOSED HER EARS WITH THE PALMS OF HER HANDS AND WAITED
6426-64290-0024 AS HE SPOKE SHE ROSE TO HER FEET HER COUNTENANCE ILLUMINED BOTH WITH RIGHTEOUS ANGER AND THE TENDER SHINE OF PRAYER HER LOOK WENT TO WHAT HE HAD OF A HEART AND THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE COLOR ROSE TO HIS FACE GONE A STEP TOO FAR DAMN IT HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF

6426-64290-0027 I WILL NOW RELATE WHAT PASSED WHILE MARY SAT DEAF IN THE CORNER MISTER REDMAIN ASKED HIS VISITOR WHAT HE WOULD HAVE AS IF ALTHOUGH IT WAS QUITE EARLY HE MUST AS A MATTER OF COURSE STAND IN NEED OF REFRESHMENT
6426-64290-0028 HE MADE CHOICE OF BRANDY AND SODA WATER AND THE BELL WAS RUNG
6426-64290-0029 A GOOD DEAL OF CONVERSATION FOLLOWED ABOUT A DISPUTED POINT IN A LATE GAME OF CARDS AT ONE OF THE CLUBS THE TALK THEN VEERED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION THAT OF PERSONAL ADVENTURE SO GUIDED BY MISTER REDMAIN HE TOLD EXTRAVAGANT STORIES ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS DOINGS IN PARTICULAR VARIOUS
6426-64290-0030 RUSES BY WHICH HE HAD CONTRIVED TO LAY HIS HANDS ON MONEY AND WHATEVER HE TOLD HIS GUEST CAPPED NARRATING TRICK UPON TRICK TO WHICH ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS HE HAD HAD RECOURSE
6426-64290-0031 AT LAST MISTER REDMAIN TOLD HOW HE HAD ONCE GOT MONEY OUT OF A LADY I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A WORD OF TRUTH IN IT BUT IT WAS CAPPED BY THE OTHER WITH A NARRATIVE THAT SEEMED SPECIALLY PLEASING TO THE LISTENER IN THE MIDST OF A BURST OF LAUGHTER HE ROSE AND RANG THE BELL
6426-64290-0032 COUNT GALOFTA THOUGHT IT WAS TO ORDER SOMETHING MORE IN THE WAY OF REFRESHMENT AND WAS NOT A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN HE HEARD HIS HOST DESIRE THE MAN TO REQUEST THE FAVOR OF MISS YOLLAND'S PRESENCE BUT THE COUNT HAD NOT STUDIED NON EXPRESSION IN VAIN
6426-64290-0033 AND HAD BROUGHT IT TO A DEGREE OF PERFECTION NOT EASILY DISTURBED CASTING A GLANCE AT HIM AS HE GAVE THE MESSAGE MISTER REDMAIN COULD READ NOTHING BUT THIS WAS IN ITSELF SUSPICIOUS TO HIM AND JUSTLY
6426-64290-0034 FOR THE MAN OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AT SUCH A CLOSE TO THE CONVERSATION THEY HAD BEEN HAVING SEPIA HAD BEEN TOLD THAT GALOFTA WAS IN THE STUDY AND THEREFORE RECEIVED THE SUMMONS THITHER A THING THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE WITH THE GREATER ALARM
6426-64290-0035 SHE MADE CONSEQUENTLY WHAT PREPARATION SHE COULD AGAINST SURPRISE THOROUGHLY CAPABLE OF MANAGING HER FEATURES HER ANXIETY WAS SUFFICIENT NEVERTHELESS TO DEPRIVE HER OF POWER OVER HER COMPLEXION AND SHE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH THE PALLOR PECULIAR TO THE DARK SKINNED
6426-64290-0036 HAVING GREETED THE COUNT WITH THE GREATEST COMPOSURE SHE TURNED TO MISTER REDMAIN WITH QUESTION IN HER EYES COUNT GALOFTA SAID MISTER REDMAIN IN REPLY
6426-64290-0037 HAS JUST BEEN TELLING ME A CURIOUS STORY OF HOW A CERTAIN RASCAL GOT POSSESSION OF A VALUABLE JEWEL FROM A LADY WITH WHOM HE PRETENDED TO BE IN LOVE AND I THOUGHT THE OPPORTUNITY A GOOD ONE FOR SHOWING YOU A STRANGE DISCOVERY I HAVE MADE WITH REGARD TO THE SAPPHIRE MISSUS REDMAIN MISSED FOR SO LONG
6426-64290-0038 VERY ODD TRICKS ARE PLAYED WITH GEMS SUCH GEMS THAT IS AS ARE OF VALUE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH A ROGUE'S WHILE SO SAYING HE TOOK THE RING FROM ONE DRAWER AND FROM ANOTHER A BOTTLE FROM WHICH HE POURED SOMETHING INTO A CRYSTAL CUP THEN HE TOOK A FILE
6426-64290-0039 AND LOOKING AT GALOFTA IN WHOSE WELL DRILLED FEATURES HE BELIEVED HE READ SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT MERE CURIOSITY SAID I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING VERY CURIOUS
6426-64290-0040 MISTER REDMAIN FILED AWAY HEEDLESS THEN WITH THE HELP OF A PAIR OF PINCERS FREED THE STONE AND HELD IT UP IN HIS HAND YOU SEE THIS HE SAID A SPLENDID SAPPHIRE ANSWERED COUNT GALOFTA TAKING IT IN HIS FINGERS
6426-64290-0041 BUT AS MISTER REDMAIN SAW NOT LOOKING AT IT CLOSELY I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD IT CALLED A SPLENDID STONE SAID SEPIA WHOSE COMPLEXION THOUGH NOT HER FEATURES PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL CHANGES WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON SHE WAS ANXIOUS
6426-64290-0042 NOR DID HER INQUISITOR FAIL TO SURPRISE THE UNEASY GLANCES SHE THREW FURTIVELY THOUGH INVOLUNTARILY IN THE FACE OF THE COUNT WHO NEVER ONCE LOOKED IN HERS TOLERABLY SURE OF HIMSELF HE WAS NOT SURE OF HER
6426-64290-0043 THAT RING WHEN I BOUGHT IT THE STONE OF IT SAID MISTER REDMAIN WAS A STAR SAPPHIRE AND WORTH SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS NOW THE WHOLE AFFAIR IS WORTH ABOUT TEN AS HE SPOKE HE THREW THE STONE INTO THE CUP LET IT LIE A FEW MOMENTS AND TOOK IT OUT AGAIN
6426-64290-0044 THERE HE SAID HOLDING OUT THE THIN PART ON THE TIP OF A FINGER THAT IS A SLICE OF SAPPHIRE AND THERE HOLDING OUT THE REST OF THE SEEMING STONE THAT IS GLASS WHAT A SHAME CRIED SEPIA
6426-64290-0045 OF COURSE SAID THE COUNT YOU WILL PROSECUTE THE JEWELER I WILL NOT PROSECUTE THE JEWELER ANSWERED MISTER REDMAIN BUT I HAVE TAKEN SOME TROUBLE TO FIND OUT WHO CHANGED THE STONES
6426-64290-0046 WHEN HE TURNED THE COUNT WAS GONE AS HE HAD EXPECTED AND SEPIA STOOD WITH EYES FULL OF ANGER AND FEAR HER FACE WAS SET AND COLORLESS AND STRANGE TO LOOK UPON VERY ODD AIN'T IT
6426-64290-0047 SAID MISTER REDMAIN AND OPENING THE DOOR OF HIS DRESSING ROOM CALLED OUT MISS MARSTON WHEN HE TURNED SEPIA TOO WAS GONE I WOULD NOT HAVE MY READER TAKE SEPIA FOR AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE ROBBERY EVEN MISTER REDMAIN DID NOT BELIEVE THAT
6426-64290-0048 HE HAD BEFORE DISCOVERED THAT ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THE RING DISAPPEARED THE COUNT HAD HAD LOSSES AND WAS SUPPOSED UNABLE TO MEET THEM BUT HAD SUDDENLY SHOWED HIMSELF AGAIN FLUSH OF MONEY AND FROM THAT TIME HAD HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY RUN OF LUCK
6426-64290-0049 HE WORE A NEW HAT AND WAS CLEAN SHAVED EXCEPT HIS UPPER LIP PRESENTLY A MAN CAME OUT OF THE MEWS IN A SCOTCH CAP AND A FULL BEARD WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM MISTER REDMAIN DID NOT CARE
6426-64290-0050 HE HAD NO DESIRE TO PUNISH HIM IT WAS ENOUGH HE HAD FOUND HIM OUT PROVED HIS SUSPICION CORRECT AND OBTAINED EVIDENCE AGAINST SEPIA HE DID NOT AT ONCE MAKE UP HIS MIND HOW HE WOULD ACT ON THIS LAST
