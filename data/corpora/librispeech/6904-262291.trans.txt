6904-262291-0000 CHECKMATED CONSTANCE CHANNING PROCEEDED TO HER DUTIES AS USUAL AT LADY AUGUSTA YORKE'S SHE DREW HER VEIL OVER HER FACE ONLY TO TRAVERSE THE VERY SHORT WAY THAT CONVEYED HER THITHER FOR THE SENSE OF SHAME WAS STRONG UPON HER
6904-262291-0001 NOT SHAME FOR ARTHUR BUT FOR HAMISH IT HAD HALF BROKEN CONSTANCE'S HEART THERE ARE TIMES IN OUR EVERY DAY LIVES WHEN ALL THINGS SEEM TO WEAR A DEPRESSING ASPECT TURN WHICH WAY WE WILL THEY WERE WEARING IT THAT DAY TO CONSTANCE
6904-262291-0002 APART FROM HOME TROUBLES SHE FELT PARTICULARLY DISCOURAGED IN THE EDUCATIONAL TASK SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN YOU HEARD THE PROMISE MADE TO HER BY CAROLINE YORKE TO BE UP AND READY FOR HER EVERY MORNING AT SEVEN CAROLINE KEPT IT FOR TWO MORNINGS AND THEN FAILED
6904-262291-0003 THIS MORNING AND THE PREVIOUS MORNING CONSTANCE HAD BEEN THERE AT SEVEN AND RETURNED HOME WITHOUT SEEING EITHER OF THE CHILDREN BOTH WERE READY FOR HER WHEN SHE ENTERED NOW HOW AM I TO DEAL WITH YOU SHE SAID TO CAROLINE IN A SAD BUT AFFECTIONATE TONE
6904-262291-0004 I DO NOT WISH TO FORCE YOU TO OBEY ME I WOULD PREFER THAT YOU SHOULD DO IT CHEERFULLY IT IS TIRESOME TO GET UP EARLY RESPONDED CAROLINE I CAN'T WAKE WHEN MARTHA COMES
6904-262291-0005 I DON'T SEE ANY GOOD IN GETTING UP EARLY CRIED CAROLINE
6904-262291-0006 BUT MISS CHANNING WHY NEED WE LEARN TO GET UP EARLY WE ARE LADIES IT'S ONLY THE POOR WHO NEED GET UP AT UNREASONABLE HOURS THOSE WHO HAVE THEIR LIVING TO EARN IS IT ONLY THE POOR WHO ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO GOD FOR WASTE OF TIME CAROLINE CAROLINE PAUSED
6904-262291-0007 SHE DID NOT LIKE TO GIVE UP HER ARGUMENT IT'S SO VERY LOW LIVED TO GET UP WITH THE SUN I DON'T THINK REAL LADIES EVER DO IT YOU THINK REAL LADIES WAIT UNTIL THE SUN HAS BEEN UP A FEW HOURS AND WARMED THE EARTH FOR THEM
6904-262291-0008 SAID CAROLINE BUT IT WAS NOT SPOKEN VERY READILY FOR SHE HAD A SUSPICION THAT MISS CHANNING WAS LAUGHING AT HER MAY I ASK WHERE YOU HAVE ACQUIRED YOUR NOTIONS OF REAL LADIES CAROLINE CAROLINE POUTED DON'T YOU CALL COLONEL JOLLIFFE'S DAUGHTERS LADIES MISS CHANNING
6904-262291-0009 YES IN POSITION THAT'S WHERE WE WENT YESTERDAY YOU KNOW MARY JOLLIFFE SAYS SHE NEVER GETS UP UNTIL HALF PAST EIGHT AND THAT IT IS NOT LADY LIKE TO GET UP EARLIER REAL LADIES DON'T MISS CHANNING
6904-262291-0010 OH YES REPLIED CAROLINE HER LISTLESS MOOD CHANGING TO ANIMATION ANECDOTES OR ANYTHING OF THAT DESULTORY KIND BEING FAR MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE YOUNG LADY THAN LESSONS
6904-262291-0011 BEFORE I BEGIN WILL YOU TELL ME WHETHER YOU CONDESCEND TO ADMIT THAT OUR GOOD QUEEN IS A REAL LADY OH MISS CHANNING NOW YOU ARE LAUGHING AT ME AS IF ANY ONE IN ALL ENGLAND COULD BE SO GREAT A LADY AS THE QUEEN VERY GOOD
6904-262291-0012 WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL A CHILD OF HER OWN AGE THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE NOBILITY WAS BROUGHT TO KENSINGTON PALACE TO SPEND THE DAY WITH HER IN TALKING TOGETHER THE PRINCESS VICTORIA MENTIONED SOMETHING SHE HAD SEEN WHEN OUT OF DOORS THAT MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
6904-262291-0013 AT SEVEN O'CLOCK EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG VISITOR HOW EARLY THAT IS TO BE ABROAD I NEVER GET OUT OF BED UNTIL EIGHT IS THERE ANY USE IN RISING SO EARLY THE DUCHESS OF KENT WHO WAS PRESENT TOOK UP THE ANSWER
6904-262291-0014 MY DAUGHTER MAY BE CALLED TO FILL THE THRONE OF ENGLAND WHEN SHE SHALL BE GROWN UP THEREFORE IT IS ESPECIALLY NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD LEARN THE FULL VALUE OF TIME YOU SEE CAROLINE THE PRINCESS WAS NOT ALLOWED TO WASTE HER MORNINGS IN BED ALTHOUGH SHE WAS DESTINED TO BE THE FIRST LADY IN THE LAND
6904-262291-0015 WE MAY BE THANKFUL TO HER ADMIRABLE MOTHER FOR MAKING HER IN THAT AS IN MANY OTHER THINGS A PATTERN TO US IS IT A TRUE ANECDOTE MISS CHANNING IT WAS RELATED TO MY MOTHER MANY YEARS AGO BY A LADY WHO WAS AT THAT TIME
6904-262291-0016 VERY MUCH AT KENSINGTON PALACE I THINK THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT OF ITS TRUTH ONE FACT WE ALL KNOW CAROLINE THE QUEEN RETAINS HER EARLY HABITS AND IMPLANTS THEM IN HER CHILDREN WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE WOULD BE HER MAJESTY'S SURPRISE WERE ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS
6904-262291-0017 SAY THE PRINCESS HELENA OR THE PRINCESS LOUISE TO DECLINE TO RISE EARLY FOR THEIR MORNING STUDIES WITH THEIR GOVERNESS MISS HILDYARD ON THE PLEA THAT IT WAS NOT LADY LIKE CAROLINE'S OBJECTION APPEARED TO BE MELTING AWAY UNDER HER
6904-262291-0018 BUT IT IS A DREADFUL PLAGUE SHE GRUMBLED TO BE OBLIGED TO GET UP FROM ONE'S NICE WARM BED FOR THE SAKE OF SOME HORRID OLD LESSONS YOU SPOKE OF THE POOR' THOSE WHO HAVE THEIR LIVING TO EARN' AS THE ONLY CLASS WHO NEED RISE EARLY RESUMED CONSTANCE
6904-262291-0019 PUT THAT NOTION AWAY FROM YOU AT ONCE AND FOR EVER CAROLINE THERE CANNOT BE A MORE FALSE ONE THE HIGHER WE GO IN THE SCALE OF LIFE THE MORE ONEROUS BECOME OUR DUTIES IN THIS WORLD AND THE GREATER IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GOD HE TO WHOM FIVE TALENTS WERE INTRUSTED
6904-262291-0020 DID NOT MAKE THEM OTHER FIVE BY WASTING HIS DAYS IN IDLENESS OH CAROLINE FANNY COME CLOSER AND LISTEN TO ME YOUR TIME AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOOD MUST BE USED NOT ABUSED OR WASTED
6904-262291-0021 SAID CAROLINE REPENTANTLY I WISH MAMMA HAD TRAINED ME TO IT WHEN I WAS A CHILD AS THE DUCHESS OF KENT TRAINED THE PRINCESS I MIGHT HAVE LEARNED TO LIKE IT BY THIS TIME LONG BEFORE THIS SAID CONSTANCE DO YOU REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD SAYING
6904-262291-0022 DO WHAT YOU OUGHT THAT YOU MAY DO WHAT YOU LIKE HABIT IS SECOND NATURE WERE I TOLD THAT I MIGHT LIE IN BED EVERY MORNING UNTIL NINE OR TEN O'CLOCK AS A GREAT FAVOUR I SHOULD CONSIDER IT A GREAT PUNISHMENT BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED TO GET UP MISS CHANNING
6904-262291-0023 AND IT IS NOTHING SHORT OF PUNISHMENT TO ME TO DO SO THE PUNISHMENT OF SELF DENIAL WE ALL HAVE TO BEAR CAROLINE BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WILL TAKE AWAY HALF ITS STING WHAT ASKED CAROLINE EAGERLY CONSTANCE BENT TOWARDS HER
6904-262291-0024 JESUS CHRIST SAID IF ANY WILL COME AFTER ME LET HIM DENY HIMSELF AND TAKE UP HIS CROSS DAILY AND FOLLOW ME WHEN ONCE WE LEARN HOW TO TAKE IT UP CHEERFULLY BRAVELY FOR HIS SAKE LOOKING TO HIM TO BE HELPED THE STING IS GONE
6904-262291-0025 NO CROSS NO CROWN YOU KNOW MY CHILDREN NO CROSS NO CROWN CONSTANCE HAD SUFFICIENT CROSS TO CARRY JUST THEN IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING LADY AUGUSTA CAME INTO THE ROOM BOISTEROUSLY HER MANNER INDICATIVE OF GREAT SURPRISE
6904-262291-0026 MISS CHANNING WHAT IS THIS TALE ABOUT YOUR BROTHER'S HAVING BEEN ARRESTED FOR STEALING THAT MISSING BANK NOTE SOME VISITORS HAVE JUST CALLED IN UPON ME AND THEY SAY THE TOWN IS RINGING WITH THE NEWS
6904-262291-0027 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OF CONSTANCE CHANNING'S BITTER PILLS THEY WERE TO BE HER PORTION FOR MANY A DAY HER HEART FLUTTERED HER CHEEK VARIED AND HER ANSWER TO LADY AUGUSTA YORKE WAS LOW AND TIMID IT IS TRUE THAT HE WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY ON SUSPICION
6904-262291-0028 WHAT A SHOCKING THING IS HE IN PRISON OH NO DID HE TAKE THE NOTE THE QUESTION PAINED CONSTANCE WORSE THAN ALL HE DID NOT TAKE IT SHE REPLIED IN A CLEAR SOFT TONE TO THOSE WHO KNOW ARTHUR WELL IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK SO
6904-262291-0029 BUT HE WAS BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES YESTERDAY I HEAR AND IS GOING UP AGAIN TO DAY YES THAT IS SO AND ROLAND COULD NOT OPEN HIS LIPS TO TELL ME OF THIS WHEN I CAME HOME LAST NIGHT GRUMBLED MY LADY WE WERE LATE AND HE WAS THE ONLY ONE UP
6904-262291-0030 GERALD AND TOD WERE IN BED I SHALL ASK HIM WHY HE DID NOT BUT MISS CHANNING THIS MUST BE A DREADFUL BLOW FOR YOU ALL IT WOULD BE FAR WORSE LADY AUGUSTA IF WE BELIEVED HIM GUILTY SHE REPLIED FROM HER ACHING HEART
6904-262291-0031 CONTINUED MY LADY DISPLAYING AS LITTLE DELICACY OF FEELING AS SHE COULD WELL DO IT WOULD BE QUITE A DANGEROUS THING YOU KNOW FOR MY ROLAND TO BE IN THE SAME OFFICE BE AT EASE LADY AUGUSTA RETURNED CONSTANCE WITH A TINGE OF IRONY SHE COULD NOT WHOLLY SUPPRESS
6904-262291-0032 YOUR SON WILL INCUR NO HARM FROM THE COMPANIONSHIP OF ARTHUR WHAT DOES HAMISH SAY HANDSOME HAMISH HE DOES NOT DESERVE THAT SUCH A BLOW SHOULD COME TO HIM
6904-262291-0033 SHE BENT HER FACE OVER THE EXERCISE SHE WAS CORRECTING IS HE LIKELY TO BE CLEARED OF THE CHARGE PERSEVERINGLY RESUMED LADY AUGUSTA
6904-262291-0034 NOT BY ACTUAL PROOF I FEAR ANSWERED CONSTANCE PRESSING HER HAND UPON HER BROW AS SHE REMEMBERED THAT HE COULD ONLY BE PROVED INNOCENT BY ANOTHER'S BEING PROVED GUILTY
6904-262291-0035 THAT POSITIVE PROOF OF HIS INNOCENCE WILL BE DIFFICULT WELL IT IS A DREADFUL THING CONCLUDED LADY AUGUSTA MEANWHILE AT THE VERY MOMENT HER LADYSHIP WAS SPEAKING THE MAGISTRATES WERE IN THE TOWN HALL IN FULL CONCLAVE THE CASE BEFORE THEM THE NEWS HAD SPREAD
