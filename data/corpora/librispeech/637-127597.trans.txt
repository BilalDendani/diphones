637-127597-0000 ONCE MORE THE APPROACH OF THE STRANGER WAS HERALDED AND THE INTELLIGENCE OPERATED UPON ME LIKE MAGIC AGAIN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONVERSE WITH HIM IN MY OWN LANGUAGE AND I RESOLVE AT ALL HAZARDS TO CONCERT WITH HIM SOME SCHEME HOWEVER DESPERATE
637-127597-0001 TO RESCUE ME FROM A CONDITION THAT HAD NOW BECOME INSUPPORTABLE AS HE DREW NEAR I REMEMBERED WITH MANY MISGIVINGS THE INAUSPICIOUS TERMINATION OF OUR FORMER INTERVIEW AND WHEN HE ENTERED THE HOUSE I WATCHED WITH INTENSE ANXIETY
637-127597-0002 THE RECEPTION HE MET WITH FROM ITS INMATES TO MY JOY HIS APPEARANCE WAS HAILED WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND ACCOSTING ME KINDLY HE SEATED HIMSELF BY MY SIDE AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE NATIVES AROUND HIM
637-127597-0003 HIS NATIVE VALLEY AND THAT HE INTENDED TO RETURN TO IT THE SAME DAY AT ONCE IT STRUCK ME THAT COULD I BUT REACH THAT VALLEY UNDER HIS PROTECTION I MIGHT EASILY FROM THENCE REACH NUKUHEVA BY WATER AND ANIMATED BY THE PROSPECT WHICH THIS PLAN HELD OUT
637-127597-0004 I DISCLOSED IT IN A FEW BRIEF WORDS TO THE STRANGER AND ASKED HIM HOW IT COULD BE BEST ACCOMPLISHED MY HEART SUNK WITHIN ME WHEN IN HIS BROKEN ENGLISH HE ANSWERED ME THAT IT COULD NEVER BE EFFECTED KANAKA NO LET YOU GO NOWHERE
637-127597-0005 HE SAID YOU TABOO WHY YOU NO LIKE TO STAY PLENTY MOEE MOEE SLEEP PLENTY KI KI EAT PLENTY WAHENEE YOUNG GIRLS OH VERY GOOD PLACE TYPEE
637-127597-0006 SUPPOSE YOU NO LIKE THIS BAY WHY YOU COME YOU NO HEAR ABOUT TYPEE ALL WHITE MEN AFRAID TYPEE SO NO WHITE MEN COME THESE WORDS DISTRESSED ME BEYOND BELIEF
637-127597-0007 YOU SEE AH BY BY YOU NO MIND YOU GET WELL HE KILL YOU EAT YOU HANG YOU HEAD UP THERE LIKE HAPPAR KANAKA NOW YOU LISTEN BUT NO TALK ANY MORE BY BY I GO YOU SEE WAY I GO
637-127597-0008 AH THEN SOME NIGHT KANAKA ALL MOEE MOEE SLEEP YOU RUN AWAY YOU COME PUEEARKA I SPEAK PUEEARKA KANAKA HE NO HARM YOU AH THEN I TAKE YOU MY CANOE NUKUHEVA
637-127597-0009 AND YOU RUN AWAY SHIP NO MORE WITH THESE WORDS ENFORCED BY A VEHEMENCE OF GESTURE I CANNOT DESCRIBE MARNOO STARTED FROM MY SIDE AND IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH SOME OF THE CHIEFS WHO HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE
637-127597-0010 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IDLE FOR ME TO HAVE ATTEMPTED RESUMING THE INTERVIEW SO PEREMPTORILY TERMINATED BY MARNOO
637-127597-0011 BUT THE PLAN HE HAD SUGGESTED STRUCK ME AS ONE WHICH MIGHT POSSIBLY BE ACCOMPLISHED AND I RESOLVED TO ACT UPON IT AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE ACCORDINGLY WHEN HE AROSE TO DEPART I ACCOMPANIED HIM WITH THE NATIVES OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE
637-127597-0012 WITH A VIEW OF CAREFULLY NOTING THE PATH HE WOULD TAKE IN LEAVING THE VALLEY
637-127597-0013 AND LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT ME EXCLAIMED NOW YOU SEE YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU AH THEN YOU DO GOOD YOU NO DO SO AH THEN YOU DIE
637-127597-0014 WAS SOON OUT OF SIGHT A MODE OF ESCAPE WAS NOW PRESENTED TO ME BUT HOW WAS I TO AVAIL MYSELF OF IT I WAS CONTINUALLY SURROUNDED BY THE SAVAGES I COULD NOT STIR FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER WITHOUT BEING ATTENDED BY SOME OF THEM
637-127597-0015 AND EVEN DURING THE HOURS DEVOTED TO SLUMBER THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WHICH I MADE SEEMED TO ATTRACT THE NOTICE OF THOSE WHO SHARED THE MATS WITH ME IN SPITE OF THESE OBSTACLES HOWEVER I DETERMINED FORTHWITH TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT
637-127597-0016 IT WAS ALSO BY NIGHT ALONE THAT I COULD HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH MY OBJECT AND THEN ONLY BY ADOPTING THE UTMOST PRECAUTION THE ENTRANCE TO MARHEYO'S HABITATION WAS THROUGH A LOW NARROW OPENING IN ITS WICKER WORK FRONT
637-127597-0017 THIS PASSAGE FOR NO CONCEIVABLE REASON THAT I COULD DEVISE WAS ALWAYS CLOSED AFTER THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED TO REST BY DRAWING A HEAVY SLIDE ACROSS IT COMPOSED OF A DOZEN OR MORE BITS OF WOOD INGENIOUSLY FASTENED TOGETHER BY SEIZINGS OF SINNATE
637-127597-0018 WHEN ANY OF THE INMATES CHOSE TO GO OUTSIDE THE NOISE OCCASIONED BY THE REMOVING OF THIS RUDE DOOR AWAKENED EVERY BODY ELSE AND ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION I HAD REMARKED THAT THE ISLANDERS WERE NEARLY AS IRRITABLE AS MORE CIVILIZED BEINGS UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
637-127597-0019 THE DIFFICULTY THUS PLACED IN MY WAY I DETERMINED TO OBVIATE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER I WOULD GET UP BOLDLY IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT AND DRAWING THE SLIDE ISSUE FROM THE HOUSE AND PRETEND THAT MY OBJECT WAS MERELY TO PROCURE A DRINK FROM THE CALABASH
637-127597-0020 I WOULD PURPOSELY OMIT CLOSING THE PASSAGE AFTER ME AND TRUSTING THAT THE INDOLENCE OF THE SAVAGES WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM REPAIRING MY NEGLECT WOULD RETURN TO MY MAT AND WAITING PATIENTLY UNTIL ALL WERE AGAIN ASLEEP I WOULD THEN STEAL FORTH
637-127597-0021 AND AT ONCE TAKE THE ROUTE TO PUEEARKA THE VERY NIGHT WHICH FOLLOWED MARNOO'S DEPARTURE I PROCEEDED TO PUT THIS PROJECT INTO EXECUTION ABOUT MIDNIGHT AS I IMAGINED I AROSE AND DREW THE SLIDE
637-127597-0022 THE NATIVES JUST AS I HAD EXPECTED STARTED UP WHILE SOME OF THEM ASKED
637-127597-0023 WHERE ARE YOU GOING TOMMO WAI WATER
637-127597-0024 GRASPING THE CALABASH ON HEARING MY REPLY THEY SANK BACK AGAIN AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO I RETURNED TO MY MAT ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE SAVAGES TURNING RESTLESSLY
637-127597-0025 APPEARED TO RESUME THEIR SLUMBERS AND REJOICING AT THE STILLNESS WHICH PREVAILED I WAS ABOUT TO RISE AGAIN FROM MY COUCH WHEN I HEARD A SLIGHT RUSTLING A DARK FORM WAS INTERCEPTED BETWEEN ME AND THE DOORWAY THE SLIDE WAS DRAWN ACROSS IT
637-127597-0026 AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHOEVER HE WAS RETURNED TO HIS MAT THIS WAS A SAD BLOW TO ME BUT AS IT MIGHT HAVE AROUSED THE SUSPICIONS OF THE ISLANDERS TO HAVE MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT THAT NIGHT I WAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO DEFER IT UNTIL THE NEXT
637-127597-0027 SEVERAL TIMES AFTER I REPEATED THE SAME MANOEUVRE BUT WITH AS LITTLE SUCCESS AS BEFORE AS MY PRETENCE FOR WITHDRAWING FROM THE HOUSE WAS TO ALLAY MY THIRST KORY KORY EITHER SUSPECTING SOME DESIGN ON MY PART
637-127597-0028 OR ELSE PROMPTED BY A DESIRE TO PLEASE ME REGULARLY EVERY EVENING PLACED A CALABASH OF WATER BY MY SIDE EVEN UNDER THESE INAUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES I AGAIN AND AGAIN RENEWED THE ATTEMPT
637-127597-0029 BUT WHEN I DID SO MY VALET ALWAYS ROSE WITH ME AS IF DETERMINED I SHOULD NOT REMOVE MYSELF FROM HIS OBSERVATION FOR THE PRESENT THEREFORE I WAS OBLIGED TO ABANDON THE ATTEMPT BUT I ENDEAVOURED TO CONSOLE MYSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT BY THIS MODE
637-127597-0030 I MIGHT YET EFFECT MY ESCAPE SHORTLY AFTER MARNOO'S VISIT I WAS REDUCED TO SUCH A STATE THAT IT WAS WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY I COULD WALK EVEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A SPEAR AND KORY KORY AS FORMERLY
637-127597-0031 GLOOMILY PONDERING OVER THE FATE WHICH IT APPEARED NOW IDLE FOR ME TO RESIST WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE LOVED FRIENDS WHO WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THE SAVAGE ISLAND IN WHICH I WAS HELD A CAPTIVE
637-127597-0032 WHEN I REFLECTED THAT MY DREADFUL FATE WOULD FOR EVER BE CONCEALED FROM THEM AND THAT WITH HOPE DEFERRED THEY MIGHT CONTINUE TO AWAIT MY RETURN LONG AFTER MY INANIMATE FORM HAD BLENDED WITH THE DUST OF THE VALLEY
637-127597-0033 I COULD NOT REPRESS A SHUDDER OF ANGUISH HOW VIVIDLY IS IMPRESSED UPON MY MIND EVERY MINUTE FEATURE OF THE SCENE WHICH MET MY VIEW DURING THOSE LONG DAYS OF SUFFERING AND SORROW
637-127597-0034 AT MY REQUEST MY MATS WERE ALWAYS SPREAD DIRECTLY FACING THE DOOR OPPOSITE WHICH AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WAS THE HUT OF BOUGHS THAT MARHEYO WAS BUILDING WHENEVER MY GENTLE FAYAWAY AND KORY KORY
637-127597-0035 LAYING THEMSELVES DOWN BESIDE ME WOULD LEAVE ME AWHILE TO UNINTERRUPTED REPOSE I TOOK A STRANGE INTEREST IN THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENTS OF THE ECCENTRIC OLD WARRIOR ALL ALONE DURING THE STILLNESS OF THE TROPICAL MID DAY
637-127597-0036 HE WOULD PURSUE HIS QUIET WORK SITTING IN THE SHADE AND WEAVING TOGETHER THE LEAFLETS OF HIS COCOANUT BRANCHES OR ROLLING UPON HIS KNEE THE TWISTED FIBRES OF BARK TO FORM THE CORDS WITH WHICH HE TIED TOGETHER THE THATCHING OF HIS TINY HOUSE
637-127597-0037 FREQUENTLY SUSPENDING HIS EMPLOYMENT AND NOTICING MY MELANCHOLY EYE FIXED UPON HIM HE WOULD RAISE HIS HAND WITH A GESTURE EXPRESSIVE OF DEEP COMMISERATION AND THEN MOVING TOWARDS ME SLOWLY WOULD ENTER ON TIP TOES
637-127597-0038 FEARFUL OF DISTURBING THE SLUMBERING NATIVES AND TAKING THE FAN FROM MY HAND WOULD SIT BEFORE ME SWAYING IT GENTLY TO AND FRO AND GAZING EARNESTLY INTO MY FACE
637-127597-0039 WERE THREE MAGNIFICENT BREAD FRUIT TREES AT THIS MOMENT I CAN RECAP TO MY MIND THEIR SLENDER SHAFTS AND THE GRACEFUL INEQUALITIES OF THEIR BARK ON WHICH MY EYE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DWELL DAY AFTER DAY
637-127597-0040 IN THE MIDST OF MY SOLITARY MUSINGS IT IS STRANGE HOW INANIMATE OBJECTS WILL TWINE THEMSELVES INTO OUR AFFECTIONS ESPECIALLY IN THE HOUR OF AFFLICTION EVEN NOW
637-127597-0041 AMIDST ALL THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF THE PROUD AND BUSY CITY IN WHICH I AM DWELLING THE IMAGE OF THOSE THREE TREES SEEMS TO COME AS VIVIDLY BEFORE MY EYES AS IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY PRESENT
