3728-105398-0031 THE MASK OF AN INANE FOP HAD BEEN A GOOD ONE AND THE PART CONSUMMATELY WELL PLAYED NO WONDER THAT CHAUVELIN'S SPIES HAD FAILED TO DETECT
3728-105398-0032 IN THE APPARENTLY BRAINLESS NINCOMPOOP THE MAN WHOSE RECKLESS DARING AND RESOURCEFUL INGENUITY HAD BAFFLED THE KEENEST FRENCH SPIES BOTH IN FRANCE AND IN ENGLAND EVEN LAST NIGHT WHEN CHAUVELIN WENT TO LORD GRENVILLE'S DINING ROOM TO SEEK THAT DARING SCARLET PIMPERNEL

3728-105398-0039 BUT WAS READY TO EFFACE HERSELF SHE KISSED MARGUERITE AGAIN AND AGAIN THEN WALKED SADLY BACK ACROSS THE LAWN MARGUERITE DID NOT MOVE SHE REMAINED THERE THINKING WONDERING WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
3728-105398-0040 JUST AS LITTLE SUZANNE WAS ABOUT TO MOUNT THE TERRACE STEPS A GROOM CAME RUNNING ROUND THE HOUSE TOWARDS HIS MISTRESS HE CARRIED A SEALED LETTER IN HIS HAND SUZANNE INSTINCTIVELY TURNED BACK HER HEART TOLD HER THAT HERE PERHAPS WAS FURTHER ILL NEWS FOR HER FRIEND

3728-105398-0044 MARGUERITE'S SENSES REELED HER VERY SOUL SEEMED TO BE LEAVING HER BODY SHE TOTTERED AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN BUT FOR SUZANNE'S ARM ROUND HER WAIST WITH SUPERHUMAN EFFORT SHE REGAINED CONTROL OVER HERSELF THERE WAS YET MUCH TO BE DONE

3728-105398-0046 SUZANNE MADE NO REPLY SHE KISSED MARGUERITE TENDERLY AND OBEYED WITHOUT A WORD THE CHILD WAS OVERAWED BY THE TERRIBLE NAMELESS MISERY IN HER FRIEND'S FACE A MINUTE LATER THE GROOM RETURNED FOLLOWED BY THE RUNNER WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER WHO GAVE YOU THIS PACKET ASKED MARGUERITE
3728-105398-0047 YES MY LADY A SPECIAL COACH HE HAD ORDERED I UNDERSTOOD FROM HIS MAN THAT HE WAS POSTING STRAIGHT TO DOVER THAT'S ENOUGH YOU MAY GO THEN SHE TURNED TO THE GROOM MY COACH AND THE FOUR SWIFTEST HORSES IN THE STABLES TO BE READY AT ONCE
3728-105398-0048 WHAT'S TO BE DONE WHAT'S TO BE DONE WHERE TO FIND HIM
3728-105398-0049 BUT THIS WAS NOT THE MOMENT FOR REMORSE AND DESPAIR SHE HAD DONE UNWITTINGLY AN AWFUL AND TERRIBLE THING THE VERY WORST CRIME IN HER EYES THAT WOMAN EVER COMMITTED SHE SAW IT IN ALL ITS HORROR
3728-105398-0050 HER VERY BLINDNESS IN NOT HAVING GUESSED HER HUSBAND'S SECRET SEEMED NOW TO HER ANOTHER DEADLY SIN SHE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN SHE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN HOW COULD SHE IMAGINE THAT A MAN WHO COULD LOVE WITH SO MUCH INTENSITY AS PERCY BLAKENEY HAD LOVED HER FROM THE FIRST
3728-105398-0051 HOW COULD SUCH A MAN BE THE BRAINLESS IDIOT HE CHOSE TO APPEAR SHE AT LEAST OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS WEARING A MASK AND HAVING FOUND THAT OUT SHE SHOULD HAVE TORN IT FROM HIS FACE WHENEVER THEY WERE ALONE TOGETHER HER LOVE FOR HIM HAD BEEN PALTRY AND WEAK
3728-105398-0052 EASILY CRUSHED BY HER OWN PRIDE AND SHE TOO HAD WORN A MASK IN ASSUMING A CONTEMPT FOR HIM WHILST AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTOOD HIM BUT THERE WAS NO TIME NOW TO GO OVER THE PAST
3728-105398-0053 BY HER OWN BLINDNESS SHE HAD SINNED NOW SHE MUST REPAY NOT BY EMPTY REMORSE BUT BY PROMPT AND USEFUL ACTION PERCY HAD STARTED FOR CALAIS UTTERLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT HIS MOST RELENTLESS ENEMY WAS ON HIS HEELS
3728-105398-0054 HE HAD SET SAIL EARLY THAT MORNING FROM LONDON BRIDGE PROVIDED HE HAD A FAVOURABLE WIND HE WOULD NO DOUBT BE IN FRANCE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS NO DOUBT HE HAD RECKONED ON THE WIND AND CHOSEN THIS ROUTE CHAUVELIN ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD POST TO DOVER
3728-105398-0055 AND UNDOUBTEDLY REACH CALAIS MUCH ABOUT THE SAME TIME ONCE IN CALAIS PERCY WOULD MEET ALL THOSE WHO WERE EAGERLY WAITING FOR THE NOBLE AND BRAVE SCARLET PIMPERNEL WHO HAD COME TO RESCUE THEM FROM HORRIBLE AND UNMERITED DEATH
3728-105398-0056 WITH CHAUVELIN'S EYES NOW FIXED UPON HIS EVERY MOVEMENT PERCY WOULD THUS NOT ONLY BE ENDANGERING HIS OWN LIFE BUT THAT OF SUZANNE'S FATHER THE OLD COMTE DE TOURNAY AND OF THOSE OTHER FUGITIVES WHO WERE WAITING FOR HIM AND TRUSTING IN HIM
3728-105398-0057 THERE WAS ALSO ARMAND WHO HAD GONE TO MEET DE TOURNAY SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL WAS WATCHING OVER HIS SAFETY ALL THESE LIVES AND THAT OF HER HUSBAND LAY IN MARGUERITE'S HANDS THESE SHE MUST SAVE
3728-105398-0058 IF HUMAN PLUCK AND INGENUITY WERE EQUAL TO THE TASK UNFORTUNATELY SHE COULD NOT DO ALL THIS QUITE ALONE ONCE IN CALAIS SHE WOULD NOT KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER HUSBAND WHILST CHAUVELIN IN STEALING THE PAPERS AT DOVER
3728-105398-0059 HAD OBTAINED THE WHOLE ITINERARY ABOVE EVERY THING SHE WISHED TO WARN PERCY SHE KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT HIM BY NOW TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULD NEVER ABANDON THOSE WHO TRUSTED IN HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT TURN HIS BACK FROM DANGER
3728-105398-0060 AND LEAVE THE COMTE DE TOURNAY TO FALL INTO THE BLOODTHIRSTY HANDS THAT KNEW OF NO MERCY BUT IF HE WERE WARNED HE MIGHT FORM NEW PLANS BE MORE WARY MORE PRUDENT UNCONSCIOUSLY HE MIGHT FALL INTO A CUNNING TRAP
3728-105398-0061 BUT ONCE WARNED HE MIGHT YET SUCCEED AND IF HE FAILED IF INDEED FATE AND CHAUVELIN WITH ALL THE RESOURCES AT HIS COMMAND PROVED TOO STRONG FOR THE DARING PLOTTER AFTER ALL THEN AT LEAST SHE WOULD BE THERE BY HIS SIDE
3728-105398-0062 TO COMFORT LOVE AND CHERISH TO CHEAT DEATH PERHAPS AT THE LAST BY MAKING IT SEEM SWEET IF THEY DIED BOTH TOGETHER LOCKED IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS WITH THE SUPREME HAPPINESS OF KNOWING THAT PASSION HAD RESPONDED TO PASSION AND THAT ALL MISUNDERSTANDINGS WERE AT AN END
3728-105398-0063 HER WHOLE BODY STIFFENED AS WITH A GREAT AND FIRM RESOLUTION THIS SHE MEANT TO DO IF GOD GAVE HER WITS AND STRENGTH HER EYES LOST THEIR FIXED LOOK THEY GLOWED WITH INWARD FIRE AT THE THOUGHT OF MEETING HIM AGAIN SO SOON IN THE VERY MIDST OF MOST DEADLY PERILS
3728-105398-0064 THEY SPARKLED WITH THE JOY OF SHARING THESE DANGERS WITH HIM OF HELPING HIM PERHAPS OF BEING WITH HIM AT THE LAST IF SHE FAILED THE CHILDLIKE SWEET FACE HAD BECOME HARD AND SET THE CURVED MOUTH WAS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER HER CLENCHED TEETH
3728-105398-0065 SHE MEANT TO DO OR DIE WITH HIM AND FOR HIS SAKE A FROWN WHICH SPOKE OF AN IRON WILL AND UNBENDING RESOLUTION APPEARED BETWEEN THE TWO STRAIGHT BROWS ALREADY HER PLANS WERE FORMED
3728-105398-0066 AND MARGUERITE REMEMBERED WITH A THRILL WITH WHAT BLIND ENTHUSIASM THE YOUNG MAN ALWAYS SPOKE OF HIS MYSTERIOUS LEADER HE WOULD HELP HER WHERE SHE NEEDED HELP HER COACH WAS READY A CHANGE OF RAIMENT AND A FAREWELL TO LITTLE SUZANNE AND SHE COULD BE ON HER WAY
