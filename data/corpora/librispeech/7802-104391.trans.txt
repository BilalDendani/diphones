7802-104391-0000 SHE RAN UP AND DOWN HUNTING FOR A FOOTHOLD AT LAST SHE REACHED THE END OF THE WALL AND DISAPPEARED AROUND THE CORNER ERIC AND THE WIND CREATURES FOLLOWED
7802-104391-0001 BRAVO CRIED THE WIND CREATURES ERIC WENT UP AFTER HER OFTEN SLIPPING BACK AND BRUISING AND SCRATCHING HIS HANDS AND KNEES
7802-104391-0002 AT LAST THEY GAINED THE TOP THE WIND CREATURES HAD FLOWN UP AND WERE WAITING FOR THEM THERE
7802-104391-0003 THE WALL ENCLOSED THE GARDEN OF A VERY RICH FAMILY
7802-104391-0004 WITH STRAIGHT WALKS TRELLISES FOUNTAINS BENCHES AND NEAT FLOWER BEDS LAID OUT IN SQUARES AND CIRCLES NOW PILED HIGH WITH BLOSSOMING SNOW JUST AS THE CHILDREN REACHED THE TOP OF THE WALL
7802-104391-0005 THE DOOR INTO THE GARDEN FROM THE STERN GRAY MANSION BEHIND IT OPENED AND THROUGH IT CAME THREE PEOPLE FIRST WAS A VERY TALL LADY ALL WRAPPED UP IN FURS TAILS AND HEADS OF THE POOR ANIMALS THAT HAD BEEN SLAIN TO MAKE THEM HANGING FROM HER SHOULDERS AND DOWN HER BACK
7802-104391-0006 EVEN THE CHILDREN COULD SEE THAT HER FACE WAS SOUR IN SPITE OF ALL ITS SMILING THEN CAME A YOUNG MAN IN A STIFF FUNNY HAT CARRYING A CANE BEATING UP THE SNOW FLOWERS WITH IT AS HE PASSED THE FLOWER BEDS
7802-104391-0007 AND BEHIND THEM WALKED HELMA WITH HER GAZE ON THE GROUND THAT IS WHY THEY DID NOT KNOW HER AT FIRST THAT AND HER VERY STRANGE CLOTHES SHE WAS DRESSED ALL IN VELVET AND FUR
