296-142727-0000 DEFINITION OF THE EMOTIONS AFTER SENSATIONS AND IMAGES WE HAVE TO NAME AMONG THE PHENOMENA OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE WHOLE SERIES OF AFFECTIVE STATES OUR PLEASURES AND OUR PAINS OUR JOYS AND OUR GRIEFS
296-142727-0001 OUR SENTIMENTS OUR EMOTIONS AND OUR PASSIONS IT IS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT THESE STATES ARE OF A MENTAL NATURE
296-142727-0002 AS WE DO OUR SENSATIONS BUT WE CONSTANTLY CONSIDER THEM AS INDWELLING OR SUBJECTIVE STATES THIS RULE HOWEVER
296-142727-0003 AS WE DO OUR INDIFFERENT SENSATIONS THE SENSATIONS OF WEIGHT
296-142727-0004 WHICH APPEAR TO US AS PERCEIVED BY US BUT AS BEING OTHER THAN OURSELVES ON THE CONTRARY WE CONSTANTLY AND WITHOUT HESITATION REFER OUR EMOTIONAL STATES TO OUR EGO IT IS I WHO SUFFER WE SAY
296-142727-0005 I WHO COMPLAIN I WHO HOPE IT IS TRUE THAT THIS ATTRIBUTION IS NOT ABSOLUTELY CHARACTERISTIC OF MENTAL PHENOMENA FOR IT HAPPENS THAT WE PUT A PART OF OUR EGO INTO MATERIAL OBJECTS SUCH AS OUR BODIES
296-142727-0006 AND EVEN INTO OBJECTS SEPARATE FROM OUR BODIES AND WHOSE SOLE RELATION TO US IS THAT OF A LEGAL PROPRIETORSHIP WE MUST GUARD AGAINST THE SOMEWHAT FREQUENT ERROR OF IDENTIFYING THE EGO WITH THE PSYCHICAL
296-142727-0007 AS REPRESENTING THE ESSENCE OF MIND ON THIS POINT I WILL RECALL THE FINE IRONICAL IMAGE USED BY TYNDALL THE ILLUSTRIOUS ENGLISH PHYSICIST TO SHOW THE ABYSS WHICH SEPARATES THOUGHT FROM THE MOLECULAR STATES OF THE BRAIN LET US SUPPOSE HE SAYS
296-142727-0008 THAT THE SENTIMENT LOVE FOR EXAMPLE CORRESPONDS TO A RIGHT HAND SPIRAL MOVEMENT OF THE MOLECULES OF THE BRAIN AND THE SENTIMENT HATRED TO A LEFT HAND SPIRAL MOVEMENT WE SHOULD THEN KNOW THAT WHEN WE LOVE A MOVEMENT IS PRODUCED IN ONE DIRECTION
296-142727-0009 AND WHEN WE HATE IN ANOTHER BUT THE WHY WOULD REMAIN WITHOUT AN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF KNOWING WHAT PLACE IN OUR METAPHYSICAL THEORY WE OUGHT TO SECURE FOR EMOTION SEEMS DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE
296-142727-0010 AND WE EVEN FIND SOME PLEASURE IN LEAVING IT IN SUSPENSE IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE UNDERSTOOD THAT A METAPHYSICIAN IS NOT COMPELLED TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING BESIDES THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH ATOP US HERE ARE PECULIARLY OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL ORDER
296-142727-0011 THEY PROCEED FROM THE FACT THAT STUDIES ON THE NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS ARE STILL VERY LITTLE ADVANCED THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THESE STATES ARE PRETTY WELL KNOWN AND THEIR PSYCHICAL AND SOCIAL EFFECTS HAVE BEEN ABUNDANTLY DESCRIBED
296-142727-0012 BUT VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN AS TO WHAT DISTINGUISHES AN EMOTION FROM A THOUGHT TWO PRINCIPAL OPINIONS MAY BE UPHELD IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE FEELINGS WHEN WE ENDEAVOUR TO PENETRATE THEIR ESSENTIAL AND FINAL NATURE
296-142727-0013 THE FIRST AND TRADITIONAL ONE CONSISTS IN SEEING IN EMOTION A PHENOMENON SUI GENERIS THIS IS VERY SIMPLE AND LEAVES NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID
296-142727-0014 WHO BY THE BY GAVE IT A PECULIAR FORM BY CAUSING THE PLAY OF IMAGES TO INTERVENE IN THE FORMATION OF THE FEELINGS HOWEVER THIS PARTICULAR POINT IS OF SLIGHT IMPORTANCE
296-142727-0015 IT EXISTS IN ALL DOCTRINES IN WHICH THE CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOUGHT AND FEELING IS EXPUNGED AND FEELING IS BROUGHT BACK TO THOUGHT
296-142727-0016 THE FACT OF PERCEIVING SOMETHING TO PERCEIVE IS IN FACT THE PROPERTY OF INTELLIGENCE TO REASON TO IMAGINE TO JUDGE TO UNDERSTAND IS ALWAYS IN A CERTAIN SENSE TO PERCEIVE
296-142727-0017 IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT EMOTION IS NOTHING ELSE THAN A PERCEPTION OF A CERTAIN KIND AN INTELLECTUAL ACT STRICTLY COMPARABLE TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF A LANDSCAPE ONLY IN THE PLACE OF A LANDSCAPE WITH PLACID FEATURES
296-142727-0018 YOU MUST PUT A STORM A CATACLYSM OF NATURE AND INSTEAD OF SUPPOSING THIS STORM OUTSIDE US LET IT BURST WITHIN US LET IT REACH US NOT BY THE OUTER SENSES OF SIGHT AND CONDITION BUT BY THE INNER SENSES
296-142727-0019 WHAT WE THEN PERCEIVE WILL BE AN EMOTION SUCH IS THE THEORY THAT TWO AUTHORS
296-142727-0020 HAPPENED TO DISCOVER ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME
296-142727-0021 AND W JAMES AS A PHILOSOPHER THEIR THEORY AT FIRST SIGHT APPEARS SINGULAR LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH RUNS COUNTER TO OUR MENTAL HABITS IT LAYS DOWN THAT THE SYMPTOMS WHICH WE ALL TILL NOW
296-142727-0022 THE TRANSLATION AND THE DISTANT EFFECTS OF THE EMOTIONS CONSTITUTE THEIR ESSENTIAL BASE THESE EFFECTS ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE PHYSIOGNOMY THE GESTURE THE CRY AND THE SPEECH
296-142727-0023 OR THE REFLEX ACTION ON THE CIRCULATION THE PALLOR OR BLUSHING
296-142727-0024 OR IT IS THE HEART WHICH HASTENS OR SLACKENS ITS BEATS OR MAKES THEM IRREGULAR OR ENFEEBLES OR AUGMENTS THEM OR THE RESPIRATION WHICH CHANGES ITS RHYTHM OR INCREASES OR IS SUSPENDED
296-142727-0025 OR ELSE IT IS THE SECRETION OF THE SALIVA OR OF THE SWEAT WHICH FLOWS IN ABUNDANCE OR DRIES UP OR THE MUSCULAR FORCE WHICH IS INCREASED OR DECAYS
296-142727-0026 OR THE ALMOST UNDEFINABLE ORGANIC TROUBLES REVEALED TO US BY THE SINGING IN THE EARS CONSTRICTION OF THE EPIGASTRIUM THE JERKS THE TREMBLING VERTIGO OR NAUSEA ALL THIS COLLECTION OF ORGANIC TROUBLES
296-142727-0027 UNDER THE FORM OF TACTILE MUSCULAR THERMAL AND OTHER SENSATIONS UNTIL NOW THIS CATEGORY OF PHENOMENA HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT NEGLECTED BECAUSE WE SAW IN IT EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH THE ROLE IN EMOTION ITSELF SEEMED SLIGHT
296-142727-0028 AND CONSIDERS THEM THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF THE EXTERNAL EXCITANT WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY THIS ELEGANT FORMULA
296-142727-0029 IT USED TO BE SAID I PERCEIVE A DANGER I AM FRIGHTENED I TREMBLE NOW WE MUST SAY I TREMBLE BEFORE A DANGER FIRST AND IT IS AFTER HAVING TREMBLED THAT I AM FRIGHTENED
296-142727-0030 THIS IS NOT A CHANGE IN ORDER ONLY IT IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE SERIOUS THE CHANGE IS DIRECTED TO THE NATURE OF EMOTION IT IS CONSIDERED TO EXIST IN THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS INDICATED ABOVE
296-142727-0031 THESE DERANGEMENTS ARE THE BASIS OF EMOTION ITS PHYSICAL BASIS AND TO BE MOVED IS TO PERCEIVE THEM TAKE AWAY FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THIS PHYSICAL REFLEX AND EMOTION CEASES IT IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN IDEA
296-142727-0032 THIS THEORY HAS AT LEAST THE MERIT OF ORIGINALITY IT ALSO PLEASES ONE BY ITS GREAT CLEARNESS
296-142727-0033 IS LIKEWISE AN INTELLECTUALIST SYSTEM THE DEFINITION OF EMOTION AS IT IS TAUGHT BY W JAMES SEEMS EXPRESSLY MADE FOR US WHO ARE SEEKING TO RESOLVE ALL INTELLECTUAL STATES INTO PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONS ACCOMPANIED BY CONSCIOUSNESS
296-142727-0034 BY THE SIDE OF EMOTION WE MAY PLACE AS DEMANDING THE SAME ANALYTICAL STUDY THE FEELING OF EFFORT WE OUGHT TO INQUIRE WITH EFFORT AS HAS BEEN DONE WITH EMOTION WHAT IS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON
296-142727-0035 AND IN THE SAME WAY THAT THERE EXISTS AN INTELLECTUALIST THEORY OF THE EMOTIONS VIZ THAT OF JAMES
296-142727-0036 SO THERE EXISTS AN INTELLECTUALIST THEORY OF EFFORT WHICH LIKEWISE TENDS TO BRING BACK ALL WILL TO INTELLIGENCE IT IS AGAIN THE SAME AUTHOR THAT TRUE GENIUS W JAMES WHO HAS ATTEMPTED THIS REDUCTION
296-142727-0037 I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE HAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE PARALLELISM OF THE TWO THEORIES BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS EVIDENT EFFORT THAT BASIS OF ACTIVITY THAT STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH SO MANY PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE DESCRIBED AS SOMETHING SUI GENERIS
296-142727-0038 TO BE CONSCIOUS OF AN EFFORT WOULD THEN BE NOTHING ELSE THAN TO RECEIVE ALL THESE CENTRIPETAL SENSATIONS AND WHAT PROVES THIS IS THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EFFORT WHEN MOST CLEARLY MANIFESTED IS ACCOMPANIED BY SOME MUSCULAR ENERGY
296-142727-0039 SOME STRONG CONTRACTION OR SOME RESPIRATORY TROUBLE AND YIELDS IF WE RENDER THE RESPIRATION AGAIN REGULAR AND PUT THE MUSCLES BACK INTO REPOSE TO MY GREAT REGRET
296-142727-0040 IS INFINITELY INTERESTING AND LEADS TO A FAIRLY CLEAR CONCEPTION BY WHICH EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED BY A MECHANISM REFLECTED IN A MIRROR WHICH IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS BUT WE REMAIN PERPLEXED
296-142727-0041 AND WE ASK OURSELVES WHETHER THIS CLEARNESS OF PERCEPTION IS NOT SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL WHETHER AFFECTIVITY EMOTIVITY TENDENCY WILL ARE REALLY ALL REDUCED TO PERCEPTIONS OR WHETHER THEY ARE NOT RATHER IRREDUCIBLE ELEMENTS
296-142727-0042 WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT FOR INSTANCE DESIRE REPRESENT A COMPLEMENT OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS
296-142727-0043 WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO THE PHYSICAL DOMAIN AND WHICH FORMS THE MORAL WORLD
