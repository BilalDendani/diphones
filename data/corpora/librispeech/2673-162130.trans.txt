2673-162130-0000 IS THERE ANY WAY OUT IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK I UNDERTOOK TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE STATE OF MIND WHICH THE ENACTMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT HAS CREATED
2673-162130-0001 AND WHICH IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW WHOSE WIDESPREAD PREVALENCE AMONG THE BEST ELEMENTS OF OUR POPULATION IS ACKNOWLEDGED ALIKE BY PROHIBITIONISTS AND ANTI PROHIBITIONISTS
2673-162130-0002 PEOPLE FEEL IN THEIR HEARTS I SAID THAT THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH NO OTHER CHOICE BUT THAT OF EITHER SUBMITTING TO THE FULL RIGOR OF PROHIBITION OF TRYING TO PROCURE A LAW WHICH NULLIFIES THE CONSTITUTION
2673-162130-0003 OR OF EXPRESSING THEIR RESENTMENT AGAINST AN OUTRAGE ON THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION BY CONTEMPTUOUS DISREGARD OF THE LAW IT IS A DEPLORABLE CHOICE OF EVILS
2673-162130-0004 MUST ASK WHETHER THERE IS ANY PRACTICAL POSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE FROM IT THE RIGHT MEANS AND THE ONLY ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM IT IS THROUGH THE UNDOING OF THE ERROR WHICH BROUGHT IT ABOUT
2673-162130-0005 THAT IS THROUGH THE REPEAL OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT TOWARDS THAT END MANY EARNEST AND PATRIOTIC CITIZENS ARE WORKING BUT OF COURSE THEY REALIZE THE STUPENDOUS DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN
2673-162130-0006 AS A RULE THESE MEN WHILE WORKING FOR THE DISTANT GOAL OF REPEAL OF THE AMENDMENT ARE SEEKING TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE VOLSTEAD ACT A LAW WHICH WILL PERMIT THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF BEER AND LIGHT WINES
2673-162130-0007 BUT IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO CONTEMPLATE A SITUATION IN WHICH TO AVOID SOMETHING STILL WORSE
2673-162130-0008 THAT AMENDMENT IMBEDS PROHIBITION IN THE ORGANIC LAW OF THE COUNTRY AND THUS NOT ONLY IMPOSES IT UPON THE INDIVIDUAL STATES REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR DESIRES MAY BE
2673-162130-0009 NOW AN AMENDMENT REPEALING THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME CONFERRING UPON CONGRESS THE POWER TO MAKE LAWS CONCERNING THE MANUFACTURE SALE AND TRANSPORTATION OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS
2673-162130-0010 AN INCOMPARABLY MORE FAVORABLE RECEPTION FROM THE START THAN WOULD A PROPOSAL OF SIMPLE REPEAL FOR THE PUBLIC COULD READILY BE BROUGHT TO SEE THE REASONABLENESS OF GIVING THE NATION A CHANCE THROUGH ITS REPRESENTATIVES AT WASHINGTON
2673-162130-0011 TO EXPRESS ITS WILL ON THE SUBJECT FROM TIME TO TIME AND THE UNREASONABLENESS OF BINDING GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TO HELPLESS SUBMISSION
2673-162130-0012 AND IT IS RARELY THAT THAT PLEA RESTS ON STRONGER GROUND THAN IT WOULD IN THIS INSTANCE THE ONE STRONG ARGUMENT WHICH MIGHT BE URGED AGAINST THE PROPOSAL NAMELY THAT SUCH A PROVISION WOULD MAKE PROHIBITION A CONSTANT ISSUE IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS
2673-162130-0013 THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT HAS BEEN A FRIGHTFUL BREEDER OF UNSETTLEMENT AND CONTENTION WHICH BIDS FAIR TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY I HAVE OFFERED THIS SUGGESTION FOR WHAT IT MAY BE WORTH AS A PRACTICAL PROPOSAL
2673-162130-0014 IT SEEMS CERTAINLY DESERVING OF DISCUSSION AND I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM PUTTING IT FORWARD AS A POSSIBLE MEANS OF RELIEF FROM AN INTOLERABLE SITUATION BUT I DO NOT WISH TO WIND UP ON THAT NOTE THE RIGHT SOLUTION
2673-162130-0015 A SOLUTION INCOMPARABLY BETTER THAN THIS WHICH I HAVE SUGGESTED ON ACCOUNT OF ITS APPARENTLY BETTER CHANCE OF ACCEPTANCE IS THE OUTRIGHT REPEAL OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT AND MOREOVER
2673-162130-0016 THE PRIMARY NEED OF THIS MOMENT IS NOT SO MUCH ANY PRACTICAL PROPOSAL LIKELY TO BE QUICKLY REALIZED AS THE AWAKENING OF THE PUBLIC MIND TO THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF THE CASE THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW OF GOVERNMENT
2673-162130-0017 AND OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE WHICH ARE SO FLAGRANTLY SINNED AGAINST BY THE PROHIBITION AMENDMENT TO THE EXPOSITION OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THIS LITTLE BOOK HAS BEEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY CONFINED
2673-162130-0018 WHAT IS NEEDED ABOVE ALL IS A CLEAR AND WHOLEHEARTED RECOGNITION OF FUNDAMENTALS AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE GOT SO FAR AWAY FROM THEIR FUNDAMENTALS THAT SUCH RECOGNITION WILL BE DENIED WHEN THE CASE IS CLEARLY PUT BEFORE THEM
2673-162130-0019 THERE IS ONE AND ONLY ONE THING THAT COULD JUSTIFY SUCH A VIOLATION OF LIBERTY AND OF THE CARDINAL PRINCIPLES OF RATIONAL GOVERNMENT AS IS EMBODIED IN THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT IN THE FACE OF DESPERATE NECESSITY
2673-162130-0020 THERE MAY BE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE MOST DESPERATE REMEDY BUT SO FAR FROM THIS BEING A CASE OF DESPERATE NECESSITY NOTHING IS MORE UNANIMOUSLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL EXCEPT THOSE WHO LABOR UNDER AN OBSESSION
2673-162130-0021 THAN THAT THE EVIL OF DRINK HAS BEEN STEADILY DIMINISHING NOT ONLY DURING THE PERIOD OF PROHIBITION AGITATION BUT FOR MANY DECADES BEFORE THAT DRUNKENNESS HAD BEEN RAPIDLY DECLINING
2673-162130-0022 AND BOTH TEMPERATE DRINKING AND TOTAL ABSTINENCE CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASING IT IS UNNECESSARY TO APPEAL TO STATISTICS THE FAMILIAR EXPERIENCE OF EVERY MAN WHOSE MEMORY RUNS BACK TWENTY OR FORTY OR SIXTY YEARS
2673-162130-0023 IS SUFFICIENT TO PUT THE CASE BEYOND QUESTION AND EVERY SPECIES OF LITERARY AND HISTORICAL RECORD CONFIRMS THE CONCLUSION THIS VIOLENT ASSAULT UPON LIBERTY THIS CRUDE DEFIANCE OF THE MOST SETTLED PRINCIPLES OF LAWMAKING AND OF GOVERNMENT
2673-162130-0024 THIS DIVISION OF THE COUNTRY AS IT HAS BEEN WELL EXPRESSED INTO THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED THIS SOWING OF DRAGONS TEETH IN THE SHAPE OF LAWLESSNESS AND CONTEMPT FOR LAW
2673-162130-0025 HAS NOT BEEN THE DICTATE OF IMPERIOUS NECESSITY BUT THE INDULGENCE OF THE CRUDE DESIRE OF A HIGHLY ORGANIZED BUT ONE IDEAD MINORITY TO IMPOSE ITS STANDARDS OF CONDUCT UPON ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
2673-162130-0026 I AM NOT THINKING OF TOBACCO OR ANYTHING OF THE KIND TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW OR FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW IT MAY BE RELIGION
2673-162130-0027 THE TIME TO CALL A HALT IS NOW AND THE WAY TO CALL A HALT IS TO WIN BACK THE GROUND THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN LOST TO DO THAT WILL BE A SPLENDID VICTORY FOR ALL THAT WE USED TO THINK OF AS AMERICAN
2673-162130-0028 FOR LIBERTY FOR INDIVIDUALITY FOR THE FREEDOM OF EACH MAN TO CONDUCT HIS OWN LIFE IN HIS OWN WAY SO LONG AS HE DOES NOT VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS
2673-162130-0029 NOT KEPT FROM MISCHIEF TO OURSELVES BY A PATERNAL LAW COPPER FASTENED IN THE CONSTITUTION NOT WATCHED LIKE CHILDREN BY A HOST OF GUARDIANS AND SPIES AND INFORMERS
