4019-8895-0000 WHEN MELBURY HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE SEEMED MUCH MOVED AND WALKED THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT THE PREMISES
4019-8895-0001 AS THE BETROTHED OF HIS DAUGHTER HE WAS QUITE ANGRY WITH CIRCUMSTANCES FOR SO HEEDLESSLY INFLICTING ON GILES A SECOND TROUBLE
4019-8895-0002 BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME AND NOW GILES HAS TO SUFFER FOR IT POOR GILES MURMURED GRACE
4019-8895-0003 HAD WE NOT DISMISSED HIM ALREADY WE COULD HARDLY HAVE FOUND IT IN OUR HEARTS TO DISMISS HIM NOW SO I SAY BE THANKFUL I'LL DO ALL I CAN FOR HIM AS A FRIEND BUT AS A PRETENDER TO THE POSITION OF MY SON IN LAW THAT CAN NEVER BE THOUGHT OF MORE
4019-8895-0004 AND YET AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE IMPRACTICABILITY TO WHICH POOR WINTERBORNE'S SUIT HAD BEEN REDUCED WAS TOUCHING GRACE'S HEART TO A WARMER SENTIMENT ON HIS BEHALF THAN SHE HAD FELT FOR YEARS CONCERNING HIM
4019-8895-0005 HE MEANWHILE WAS SITTING DOWN ALONE IN THE OLD FAMILIAR HOUSE WHICH HAD CEASED TO BE HIS TAKING A CALM IF SOMEWHAT DISMAL SURVEY OF AFFAIRS THE PENDULUM OF THE CLOCK BUMPED EVERY NOW AND THEN AGAINST ONE SIDE OF THE CASE IN WHICH IT SWUNG
4019-8895-0006 AS THE MUFFLED DRUM TO HIS WORLDLY MARCH
4019-8895-0007 OWING OBVIOUSLY TO A CONVICTION THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE LIVING THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PROFIT BY NEXT SEASON'S CROP HE LOOKED AT THE LEASES AGAIN AND THE LETTER ATTACHED
4019-8895-0008 THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD LOST HIS HOUSES BY AN ACCIDENT WHICH MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN CIRCUMVENTED IF HE HAD KNOWN THE TRUE CONDITIONS OF HIS HOLDING THE TIME FOR PERFORMANCE HAD NOW LAPSED IN STRICT LAW BUT MIGHT NOT THE INTENTION BE CONSIDERED BY THE LANDHOLDER WHEN SHE BECAME AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
4019-8895-0009 AND HIS MORAL RIGHT TO RETAIN THE HOLDINGS FOR THE TERM OF HIS LIFE BE CONCEDED HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM WHEN HE PERCEIVED THAT DESPITE ALL THE LEGAL RECIPROCITIES AND SAFEGUARDS PREPARED AND WRITTEN THE UPSHOT OF THE MATTER AMOUNTED TO THIS
4019-8895-0010 WHETHER HE WAS TO POSSESS HIS HOUSES FOR LIFE OR NO WHILE HE WAS SITTING AND THINKING A STEP CAME TO THE DOOR AND MELBURY APPEARED LOOKING VERY SORRY FOR HIS POSITION
4019-8895-0011 WINTERBORNE WELCOMED HIM BY A WORD AND A LOOK AND WENT ON WITH HIS EXAMINATION OF THE PARCHMENTS HIS VISITOR SAT DOWN
4019-8895-0012 THROW YOURSELF UPON HER GENEROSITY
4019-8895-0013 BUT YOU MUST SAID MELBURY IN SHORT
4019-8895-0014 AND SENT TO HINTOCK HOUSE WHENCE
4019-8895-0015 MELBURY FEELING THAT HE HAD DONE SO GOOD AN ACTION IN COMING AS ALMOST TO EXTENUATE HIS PREVIOUS ARBITRARY CONDUCT TO NOTHING WENT HOME AND GILES WAS LEFT ALONE TO THE SUSPENSE OF WAITING FOR A REPLY FROM THE DIVINITY WHO SHAPED THE ENDS OF THE HINTOCK POPULATION
4019-8895-0016 BY THIS TIME ALL THE VILLAGERS KNEW OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND BEING WELLNIGH LIKE ONE FAMILY A KEEN INTEREST WAS THE RESULT ALL ROUND EVERYBODY THOUGHT OF GILES NOBODY THOUGHT OF MARTY
4019-8895-0017 HAD ANY OF THEM LOOKED IN UPON HER DURING THOSE MOONLIGHT NIGHTS WHICH PRECEDED THE BURIAL OF HER FATHER
4019-8895-0018 ITS BEAMS STREAMED ACROSS THE STILL PROFILE OF SOUTH SUBLIMED BY THE AUGUST PRESENCE OF DEATH AND ONWARD A FEW FEET FARTHER UPON THE FACE OF HIS DAUGHTER
4019-8895-0019 THE REPOSE OF A GUILELESS SOUL THAT HAD NOTHING MORE LEFT ON EARTH TO LOSE EXCEPT A LIFE WHICH SHE DID NOT OVERVALUE SOUTH WAS BURIED AND A WEEK PASSED AND WINTERBORNE WATCHED FOR A REPLY FROM MISSUS CHARMOND MELBURY WAS VERY SANGUINE AS TO ITS TENOR
4019-8895-0020 BUT WINTERBORNE HAD NOT TOLD HIM OF THE ENCOUNTER WITH HER CARRIAGE WHEN IF EVER HE HAD HEARD AN AFFRONTED TONE ON A WOMAN'S LIPS HE HAD HEARD IT ON HERS THE POSTMAN'S TIME FOR PASSING WAS JUST AFTER MELBURY'S MEN HAD ASSEMBLED IN THE SPAR HOUSE AND WINTERBORNE WHO WHEN NOT BUSY ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT
4019-8895-0021 AND MEET THE POST MAN AT THE END OF ONE OF THE GREEN RIDES THROUGH THE HAZEL COPSE IN THE STRAIGHT STRETCH OF WHICH HIS LADEN FIGURE COULD BE SEEN A LONG WAY OFF
4019-8895-0022 MORE PERHAPS THAN WINTERBORNE HIMSELF
4019-8895-0023 FITZPIERS TOO
4019-8895-0024 BUT MIGHT HAVE LIVED FOR TWENTY YEARS ELEVEN TIMES HAD WINTERBORNE GONE TO THAT CORNER OF THE RIDE AND LOOKED UP ITS LONG STRAIGHT SLOPE THROUGH THE WET GRAYS OF WINTER DAWN BUT THOUGH THE POSTMAN'S BOWED FIGURE LOOMED IN VIEW PRETTY REGULARLY HE BROUGHT NOTHING FOR GILES
4019-8895-0025 ON THE TWELFTH DAY THE MAN OF MISSIVES WHILE YET IN THE EXTREME DISTANCE HELD UP HIS HAND AND WINTERBORNE SAW A LETTER IN IT HE TOOK IT INTO THE SPAR HOUSE BEFORE HE BROKE THE SEAL
4019-8895-0026 THE LETTER WAS NOT FROM MISSUS CHARMOND HERSELF BUT HER AGENT AT SHERTON WINTERBORNE GLANCED IT OVER AND LOOKED UP
4019-8895-0027 PARTICULARLY AS SHE CONTEMPLATES PULLING THE HOUSES DOWN HE SAID QUIETLY ONLY THINK OF THAT SAID SEVERAL WINTERBORNE HAD TURNED AWAY AND SAID VEHEMENTLY TO HIMSELF THEN LET HER PULL EM DOWN
4019-8895-0028 AND BE D D TO HER CREEDLE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A FACE OF SEVEN SORROWS SAYING AH TWAS THAT SPERRIT THAT LOST EM FOR YE MAISTER WINTERBORNE SUBDUED HIS FEELINGS AND FROM THAT HOUR WHATEVER THEY WERE KEPT THEM ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF
4019-8895-0029 THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT UP TO THIS LAST MOMENT HE HAD NOURISHED A FEEBLE HOPE OF REGAINING GRACE IN THE EVENT
4019-8895-0030 NOT BEING AWARE OF THE FACT THAT HER FATHER COULD HAVE SETTLED UPON HER A FORTUNE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE BOTH TO LIVE IN COMFORT HE DEEMED IT NOW AN ABSURDITY TO DREAM ANY LONGER OF SUCH A VANITY AS MAKING HER HIS WIFE AND SANK INTO SILENCE FORTHWITH YET
4019-8895-0031 WHATEVER THE VALUE OF TACITURNITY TO A MAN AMONG STRANGERS IT IS APT TO EXPRESS MORE THAN TALKATIVENESS WHEN HE DWELLS AMONG FRIENDS
4019-8895-0032 THE COUNTRYMAN WHO IS OBLIGED TO JUDGE THE TIME OF DAY FROM CHANGES IN EXTERNAL NATURE SEES A THOUSAND SUCCESSIVE TINTS AND TRAITS IN THE LANDSCAPE WHICH ARE NEVER DISCERNED BY HIM WHO HEARS THE REGULAR CHIME OF A CLOCK BECAUSE THEY ARE NEVER IN REQUEST
4019-8895-0033 IN LIKE MANNER DO WE USE OUR EYES ON OUR TACITURN COMRADE THE INFINITESIMAL MOVEMENT OF MUSCLE CURVE HAIR AND WRINKLE WHICH WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY A VOICE GOES UNREGARDED IS WATCHED AND TRANSLATED IN THE LACK OF IT
4019-8895-0034 TILL VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE SURROUNDING CIRCLE OF FAMILIARS IS CHARGED WITH THE RESERVED ONE'S MOODS AND MEANINGS THIS WAS THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS BETWEEN WINTERBORNE AND HIS NEIGHBORS AFTER HIS STROKE OF ILL LUCK
4019-8895-0035 HE HELD HIS TONGUE AND THEY OBSERVED HIM AND KNEW THAT HE WAS DISCOMPOSED MISTER MELBURY IN HIS COMPUNCTION THOUGHT MORE OF THE MATTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE EXCEPT HIS DAUGHTER
4019-8895-0036 BUT TO SPEAK ANY FURTHER ON THE SUBJECT HE COULD NOT FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO DO NOW
4019-8895-0037 HE COULD MAKE MATTERS UNPLEASANT IF HE CHOSE TO WORK UPON GRACE AND HENCE WHEN MELBURY SAW THE YOUNG MAN APPROACHING ALONG THE ROAD ONE DAY
4019-8895-0038 HIS MANNER WAS THAT OF A MAN WHO ABANDONED ALL CLAIMS I AM GLAD TO MEET YE MISTER MELBURY HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WHOSE QUALITY HE ENDEAVORED TO MAKE AS PRACTICAL AS POSSIBLE I AM AFRAID I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP THAT MARE I BOUGHT AND
4019-8895-0039 AS I DON'T CARE TO SELL HER I SHOULD LIKE
4019-8895-0040 HE DECLARED THAT HE DID NOT LIKE TO BE HARD ON A MAN WHEN HE WAS IN DIFFICULTY BUT HE REALLY DID NOT SEE HOW WINTERBORNE COULD MARRY HIS DAUGHTER NOW WITHOUT EVEN A HOUSE TO TAKE HER TO
4019-8895-0041 HE DID NOT SPEAK OUT POSITIVELY THERE AND THEN HE ACCORDINGLY DEPARTED SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY AND WENT HOME TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE WOULD SEEK TO BRING ABOUT A MEETING WITH HER IN THE EVENING WHILE HE SAT QUIETLY PONDERING HE FANCIED THAT HE HEARD A SCRAPING ON THE WALL OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE
4019-8895-0042 AS NO WIND WAS STIRRING HE KNEW THAT IT COULD NOT BE THE ROSE TREE HE TOOK UP THE CANDLE AND WENT OUT NOBODY WAS NEAR AS HE TURNED THE LIGHT FLICKERED ON THE WHITEWASHED ROUGH CASE OF THE FRONT AND HE SAW WORDS WRITTEN THEREON IN CHARCOAL
4019-8895-0043 O GILES YOU'VE LOST YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND THEREFORE GILES YOU'LL LOSE YOUR GRACE GILES WENT IN DOORS HE HAD HIS SUSPICIONS AS TO THE SCRAWLER OF THOSE LINES BUT HE COULD NOT BE SURE
4019-8895-0044 WHAT SUDDENLY FILLED HIS HEART FAR MORE THAN CURIOSITY ABOUT THEIR AUTHORSHIP WAS A TERRIBLE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE TURNING OUT TO BE TRUE TRY TO SEE GRACE AS HE MIGHT THEY DECIDED THE QUESTION FOR HIM
4019-8895-0045 IN WHICH HE BRIEFLY STATED THAT HE WAS PLACED IN SUCH A POSITION AS TO MAKE HIM SHARE TO THE FULL MELBURY'S VIEW OF HIS OWN AND HIS DAUGHTER'S PROMISE MADE SOME YEARS BEFORE TO WISH THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS CANCELLED
4019-8895-0046 HAVING FASTENED UP THIS THEIR PLENARY ABSOLUTION HE DETERMINED TO GET IT OUT OF HIS HANDS AND HAVE DONE WITH IT TO WHICH END HE WENT OFF TO MELBURY'S AT ONCE IT WAS NOW SO LATE THAT THE FAMILY HAD ALL RETIRED HE CREPT UP TO THE HOUSE
4019-8895-0047 MELBURY HIMSELF WAS THE FIRST TO RISE THE NEXT MORNING AND WHEN HE HAD READ THE LETTER HIS RELIEF WAS GREAT
4019-8895-0048 I SHALL NOT FORGET HIM NOW TO KEEP HER UP TO HER OWN TRUE LEVEL IT HAPPENED THAT GRACE WENT OUT FOR AN EARLY RAMBLE THAT MORNING PASSING THROUGH THE DOOR AND GATE WHILE HER FATHER WAS IN THE SPAR HOUSE TO GO IN HER CUSTOMARY DIRECTION SHE COULD NOT AVOID PASSING WINTERBORNE'S HOUSE
4019-8895-0049 THE MORNING SUN WAS SHINING FLAT UPON ITS WHITE SURFACE AND THE WORDS WHICH STILL REMAINED WERE IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE TO HER SHE READ THEM HER FACE FLUSHED TO CRIMSON
4019-8895-0050 SHE COULD SEE GILES AND CREEDLE TALKING TOGETHER AT THE BACK THE CHARRED SPAR GAD WITH WHICH THE LINES HAD BEEN WRITTEN LAY ON THE GROUND BENEATH THE WALL FEELING PRETTY SURE THAT WINTERBORNE WOULD OBSERVE HER ACTION SHE QUICKLY WENT UP TO THE WALL RUBBED OUT LOSE AND INSERTED KEEP IN ITS STEAD
4019-8895-0051 THEN SHE MADE THE BEST OF HER WAY HOME WITHOUT LOOKING BEHIND HER GILES COULD DRAW AN INFERENCE NOW IF HE CHOSE THERE COULD NOT BE THE LEAST DOUBT THAT GENTLE GRACE WAS WARMING TO MORE SYMPATHY WITH AND INTEREST IN GILES WINTERBORNE THAN EVER SHE HAD DONE WHILE HE WAS
4019-8895-0052 HER PROMISED LOVER THAT SINCE HIS MISFORTUNE THOSE SOCIAL SHORTCOMINGS OF HIS WHICH CONTRASTED SO AWKWARDLY WITH HER LATER EXPERIENCES OF LIFE HAD BECOME OBSCURED BY THE GENEROUS REVIVAL OF AN OLD ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT TO HIM THOUGH MENTALLY TRAINED AND TILLED INTO FOREIGNNESS OF VIEW
4019-8895-0053 AS COMPARED WITH HER YOUTHFUL TIME GRACE WAS NOT AN AMBITIOUS GIRL AND MIGHT IF LEFT TO HERSELF HAVE DECLINED WINTERBORNE WITHOUT MUCH DISCONTENT OR UNHAPPINESS HER FEELINGS JUST NOW WERE SO FAR FROM LATENT THAT THE WRITING ON THE WALL HAD THUS QUICKENED HER TO AN UNUSUAL RASHNESS
4019-8895-0054 HAVING RETURNED FROM HER WALK SHE SAT AT BREAKFAST SILENTLY WHEN HER STEP MOTHER HAD LEFT THE ROOM SHE SAID TO HER FATHER I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THAT I SHOULD LIKE MY ENGAGEMENT TO GILES TO CONTINUE FOR THE PRESENT AT ANY RATE TILL I CAN SEE FURTHER WHAT I OUGHT TO DO
4019-8895-0055 MELBURY LOOKED MUCH SURPRISED NONSENSE HE SAID SHARPLY
4019-8895-0056 LOOK HERE HE HANDED ACROSS TO HER THE LETTER RECEIVED FROM GILES SHE READ IT AND SAID NO MORE COULD HE HAVE SEEN HER WRITE ON THE WALL SHE DID NOT KNOW
4019-8895-0057 IT WAS A FEW HOURS AFTER THIS THAT WINTERBORNE WHO CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HAD NOT PERCEIVED GRACE WRITING
4019-8895-0058 HE SAW MARTY STANDING IN HER DOOR WAY
4019-8895-0059 ALMOST WITHOUT WOMANLY CONTOURS AS YET HE WENT UP TO HER AND SAID MARTY WHY DID YOU WRITE THAT ON MY WALL LAST NIGHT IT WAS YOU YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS THE TRUTH I DIDN'T MEAN TO LET IT STAY MISTER WINTERBORNE BUT
4019-8895-0060 WHEN I WAS GOING TO RUB IT OUT YOU CAME AND I WAS OBLIGED TO RUN OFF HAVING PROPHESIED ONE THING WHY DID YOU ALTER IT TO ANOTHER YOUR PREDICTIONS CAN'T BE WORTH MUCH I HAVE NOT ALTERED IT BUT YOU HAVE NO IT IS ALTERED GO AND SEE
4019-8895-0061 MARTY CAME BACK SURPRISED WELL I NEVER SHE SAID WHO CAN HAVE MADE SUCH NONSENSE OF IT WHO INDEED SAID HE I HAVE RUBBED IT ALL OUT AS THE POINT OF IT IS QUITE GONE
4019-8895-0062 YOU'D NO BUSINESS TO RUB IT OUT I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO
4019-8895-0063 SOME IDLE BOY DID IT NO DOUBT SHE MURMURED AS THIS SEEMED VERY PROBABLE AND THE ACTUAL PERPETRATOR WAS UNSUSPECTED WINTERBORNE SAID NO MORE AND DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM HIS MIND
4019-8895-0064 WINTERBORNE THOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY OUT OF HIS HOUSE AS YET RETIRED INTO THE BACKGROUND OF HUMAN LIFE AND ACTION THEREABOUT A FEAT NOT PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT OF PERFORMANCE ANYWHERE WHEN THE DOER HAS THE ASSISTANCE OF A LOST PRESTIGE GRACE THINKING THAT WINTERBORNE SAW HER WRITE MADE NO FURTHER SIGN
