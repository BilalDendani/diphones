2552-132097-0062 QUESTIONED CECY I DON'T BELIEVE COUSIN HELEN COULD DO ANYTHING WICKED SAID KATY I TOLD MA THAT SHE HAD ON BRACELETS AND MA SAID SHE FEARED YOUR COUSIN WAS A WORLDLY PERSON RETORTED CECY PRIMMING UP HER LIPS
2552-132097-0063 I MEAN TO ASK COUSIN HELEN TO MORROW SAID KATY NEXT MORNING THE CHILDREN GOT UP VERY EARLY THEY WERE SO GLAD THAT IT WAS VACATION IF IT HADN'T BEEN
2552-132097-0064 FOR SHE DIDN'T WAKE TILL LATE THEY GREW SO IMPATIENT OF THE DELAY AND WENT UP STAIRS SO OFTEN TO LISTEN AT THE DOOR AND SEE IF SHE WERE MOVING THAT AUNT IZZIE FINALLY HAD TO ORDER THEM OFF KATY REBELLED AGAINST THIS ORDER A GOOD DEAL
2552-132097-0065 BUT SHE CONSOLED HERSELF BY GOING INTO THE GARDEN AND PICKING THE PRETTIEST FLOWERS SHE COULD FIND TO GIVE TO COUSIN HELEN THE MOMENT SHE SHOULD SEE HER WHEN AUNT IZZIE LET HER GO UP COUSIN HELEN WAS LYING ON THE SOFA
2552-132097-0066 ALL DRESSED FOR THE DAY IN A FRESH BLUE MUSLIN WITH BLUE RIBBONS AND CUNNING BRONZE SLIPPERS WITH ROSETTES ON THE TOES THE SOFA HAD BEEN WHEELED ROUND WITH ITS BACK TO THE LIGHT THERE WAS A CUSHION
2552-132097-0067 WITH A PRETTY FLUTED COVER THAT KATY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND SEVERAL OTHER THINGS WERE SCATTERED ABOUT WHICH GAVE THE ROOM QUITE A DIFFERENT AIR ALL THE HOUSE WAS NEAT BUT SOMEHOW AUNT IZZIE'S ROOMS NEVER WERE PRETTY
2552-132097-0068 CHILDREN'S EYES ARE QUICK TO PERCEIVE SUCH THINGS AND KATY SAW AT ONCE THAT THE BLUE ROOM HAD NEVER LOOKED LIKE THIS COUSIN HELEN WAS WHITE AND TIRED BUT HER EYES AND SMILE WERE AS BRIGHT AS EVER

2552-132097-0074 CECY SAID SO WHEN I TOLD HER ABOUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL NIGHT GOWN COUSIN HELEN LAUGHED AGAIN WELL SHE SAID I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK KATY PRETTY THINGS ARE NO MORE WORLDLY THAN UGLY ONES EXCEPT
2552-132097-0075 WHEN THEY SPOIL US BY MAKING US VAIN OR CARELESS OF THE COMFORT OF OTHER PEOPLE AND SICKNESS IS SUCH A DISAGREEABLE THING IN ITSELF THAT UNLESS SICK PEOPLE TAKE GREAT PAINS
2552-132097-0076 THEY SOON GROW TO BE EYESORES TO THEMSELVES AND EVERYBODY ABOUT THEM I DON'T THINK IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AN INVALID TO BE TOO PARTICULAR AND WHEN ONE HAS THE BACK ACHE AND THE HEAD ACHE AND THE ALL OVER ACHE SHE ADDED SMILING
2552-132097-0077 BECAUSE OF A RUFFLE MORE OR LESS ON ONE'S NIGHT GOWN
2552-132097-0078 THEN SHE BEGAN TO ARRANGE THE FLOWERS TOUCHING EACH SEPARATE ONE GENTLY AND AS IF SHE LOVED IT WHAT A QUEER NOISE SHE EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY STOPPING IT WAS QUEER
2552-132097-0079 A SORT OF SNUFFING AND SNORTING SOUND AS IF A WALRUS OR A SEA HORSE WERE PROMENADING UP AND DOWN IN THE HALL KATY OPENED THE DOOR BEHOLD THERE WERE JOHN AND DORRY
