3934-102413-0000 IN CAMP ON THE DESERT AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY AT LAST WE ARE OFF I AM POWERFULLY GLAD I SHALL HAVE TO ENJOY THIS TRIP FOR US BOTH
3934-102413-0001 YOU SEE HOW GREEDY I AM FOR NEW EXPERIENCES I HAVE NEVER BEEN ON A PROLONGED HUNT BEFORE SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO A HEAP OF FUN I HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT WRITING BUT SHALL TRY TO WRITE EVERY TWO DAYS

3934-102413-0003 BUT A PROFESSOR COMING FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE EAST DELAYED US A DAY AND ALSO SOME OF THE PARTY CHANGED THEIR PLANS THAT REDUCED OUR NUMBER BUT NOT OUR ENTHUSIASM
3934-102413-0004 A FEW DAYS BEFORE WE LEFT THE RANCH I TELEPHONED MISSUS LOUDERER AND TRIED TO PERSUADE HER TO GO ALONG BUT SHE REPLIED FOR WHY SHOULD I GO VAT ISS IT TO FREEZE I CAN SLEEP OUT ON SOME ROCKS HERE
3934-102413-0005 AND WITH A STICK I CAN BEAT THE SAGE BUSH WHICH WILL GIVE ME THE SMELL YOU WILL SMELL OF THE OUTSIDE AND FOR THE GAME I CAN HAVE A BEEF KILL WHICH ISS BETTER TO EAT AS ELK I LOVE MISSUS LOUDERER DEARLY
3934-102413-0006 BUT SHE IS ABSOLUTELY DEVOID OF IMAGINATION AND HER MATTER OF FACTNESS IS MIGHTY TRYING SOMETIMES HOWEVER SHE SENT ME A BOTTLE OF GOOSE GREASE TO WARD OFF COLDS FROM THE KINDER
3934-102413-0007 I TRIED MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY BUT SHE WAS PLUMB AGGRAVATING AND NON COMMITTAL AND IT SEEMED WHEN WE GOT TO GREEN RIVER THAT I WOULD BE THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE PARTY
3934-102413-0008 BESIDES ALL THE OTHERS WERE STRANGERS TO ME EXCEPT YOUNG MISTER HAYNES WHO WAS ORGANIZING THE HUNT REALLY THE PROSPECT DIDN'T SEEM SO JOYOUS THE AFTERNOON BEFORE WE WERE TO START I WENT WITH MISTER STEWART AND MISTER HAYNES TO MEET THE TRAIN
3934-102413-0009 WE WERE EXPECTING THE PROFESSOR BUT THE ONLY PASSENGER WHO GOT OFF WAS A SLIGHT GRAY EYED GIRL SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER UNCERTAINLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WENT INTO THE DEPOT WHILE WE RETURNED TO THE HOTEL
3934-102413-0010 JUST AS I STARTED UP THE STEPS MY EYES WERE GLADDENED BY THE SIGHT OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY IN HER BUCKBOARD TROTTING MERRILY UP THE STREET SHE WAVED HER HAND TO US AND DROVE UP
3934-102413-0011 CLYDE TOOK HER TEAM TO THE LIVERY BARN AND SHE CAME UP TO MY ROOM WITH ME IT'S GOING WITH YOU I AM SHE BEGAN YE'LL NEED SOMEBODY TO KEEP YEZ STRAIGHT AND TO SEW UP THE HOLES YE'LL BE SHOOTING INTO EACH OTHER
3934-102413-0012 WE WENT DOWN TO SUPPER WE WERE ALL SEATED AT ONE TABLE AND THERE WAS YET AN EMPTY PLACE
3934-102413-0013 BUT SOON THE GIRL WE HAD SEEN GET OFF THE TRAIN CAME AND SEATED HERSELF IN IT CAN ANY OF YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET TO KENDALL WYOMING SHE ASKED I DIDN'T KNOW NOR DID CLYDE
3934-102413-0014 BUT MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY KNEW SO SHE ANSWERED KENDALL IS IN THE FOREST RESERVE UP NORTH IT IS TWO HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE AND HALF OF THE DISTANCE IS ACROSS DESERT BUT THEY HAVE AN AUTOMOBILE ROUTE AS FAR AS PINEDALE
3934-102413-0015 YOU COULD GET THAT FAR ON THE AUTO STAGE AFTER THAT I SUPPOSE YOU COULD GET SOME ONE TO TAKE YOU ON THANK YOU SAID THE GIRL MY NAME IS ELIZABETH HULL
3934-102413-0016 I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD AND I AM NOT EXPECTED AT KENDALL SO I AM OBLIGED TO ASK AND TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AT ONCE MENTIONED HER OWN NAME AND INTRODUCED THE REST OF US
3934-102413-0017 AFTER SUPPER MISS HULL AND MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAD A LONG TALK I WAS NOT MUCH SURPRISED WHEN MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY CAME IN TO TELL ME THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE THE GIRL ALONG BECAUSE SHE SAID KENDALL IS ON OUR WAY
3934-102413-0018 AND IT'S GLAD I AM TO HELP A LONE GIRL DID YOU NOTICE THE FRECKLES OF HER SURE HER FORBEARS HAILED FROM KILLARNEY SO EARLY NEXT MORNING WE WERE ASTIR
3934-102413-0019 WE HAD OUTFITTED IN GREEN RIVER SO THE WAGONS WERE ALREADY LOADED I HAD RATHER DREADED THE PROFESSOR I HAD PICTURED TO MYSELF A VERY DIGNIFIED BESPECTACLED PERSON AND I MENTALLY STOOD IN AWE OF HIS GREAT LEARNING
3934-102413-0020 IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN A BOYISH LAUGHING YOUNG MAN INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS PROFESSOR GLENHOLDT HE WAS SO JOLLY SO UNAFFECTED
3934-102413-0021 AND SO ALTOGETHER LIKABLE THAT MY FEAR VANISHED AND I ENJOYED THE PROSPECT OF HIS COMPANY MISTER HAYNES AND HIS FRIEND MISTER STRUBLE ON THEIR WAGON LED THE WAY THEN WE FOLLOWED
3934-102413-0022 AND AFTER US CAME MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND MISS HULL BROUGHT UP THE REAR WITH THE PROFESSOR RIDING HORSEBACK BESIDE FIRST ONE WAGON AND THEN ANOTHER SO WE SET OUT
3934-102413-0023 THERE WAS A GREAT JANGLING AND BANGING FOR OUR TIN CAMP STOVES KEPT THE NOISE GOING NEITHER THE CHILDREN NOR I CAN RIDE UNDER COVER ON A WAGON WE GET SO SICK
3934-102413-0024 SO THERE WE WERE PERCHED HIGH UP ON GREAT ROLLS OF BEDDING AND A TENT I RECKON WE LOOKED FUNNY TO THE ONLOOKERS LOOKING ON AS WE CLATTERED DOWN THE STREET BUT WE WERE OFF AND THAT MEANT A HEAP
3934-102413-0025 ALL THE MORNING OUR WAY LAY UP THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER PAST THE GREAT RED CLIFFS AND THROUGH TINY GREEN PARKS BUT JUST BEFORE NOON THE ROAD WOUND ITSELF UP ON TO THE MESA
3934-102413-0026 WHICH IS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF THE DESERT WE CROWDED INTO THE SHADOW OF THE WAGONS TO EAT OUR MIDDAY MEAL BUT WE COULD NOT STOP LONG BECAUSE IT WAS TWENTY EIGHT MILES TO WHERE WE COULD GET WATER FOR THE HORSES
3934-102413-0027 WHEN WE SHOULD CAMP THAT NIGHT SO WE WASTED NO TIME SHORTLY AFTER NOON WE COULD SEE WHITE CLOUDS OF ALKALI DUST AHEAD BY AND BY WE CAME UP WITH THE DUST RAISERS
3934-102413-0028 THE CHILDREN AND I HAD GOT INTO THE BUCKBOARD WITH MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND MISS HULL SO AS TO RIDE EASIER AND BE ABLE TO GOSSIP AND WE HAD DRIVEN AHEAD OF THE WAGONS SO AS TO AVOID THE STINGING DUST
3934-102413-0029 THAT HE WAS A WESTERNER WE KNEW BY HIS COWBOY HAT AND BOOTS THAT SHE WAS AN EASTERNER BY HER NOT KNOWING HOW TO DRESS FOR THE RIDE ACROSS THE DESERT
3934-102413-0030 SHE WORE A FOOLISH LITTLE CHIFFON HAT WHICH THE ALKALI DUST HAD RUINED AND ALL THE REST OF HER CLOTHES MATCHED
3934-102413-0031 BUT OVER THEM THE ENTERPRISING YOUNG MAN HAD RAISED ONE OF THOSE BIG OLD SUNSHADES THAT HAD LETTERING ON THEM IT KEPT WOBBLING ABOUT IN THE SOCKET HE HAD IMPROVISED ONE MINUTE WE COULD SEE TEA
3934-102413-0032 THEIR SUNSHADE KEPT REVOLVING ABOUT THAT WAY AND SOMETIMES THEIR HEADS REVOLVED A LITTLE BIT TOO
3934-102413-0033 WILL YE TELL ME SOMETHING OH YES THEY WOULD THEN SHE SAID WHICH OF YOU ARE TEA AND WHICH COFFEE THEIR ANSWER WAS TO DRIVE UP FASTER AND STIR UP A POWERFUL LOT OF DUST
3934-102413-0034 THEY KEPT PRETTY WELL AHEAD AFTER THAT BUT AT SUNDOWN WE CAME UP WITH THEM AT THE WELL WHERE WE WERE TO CAMP THIS WELL HAD BEEN SUNK BY THE COUNTY FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF TRAVELERS
3934-102413-0035 AND WE WERE MIGHTY THANKFUL TO FIND IT IT CAME OUT THAT OUR YOUNG COUPLE WERE BRIDE AND GROOM THEY HAD NEVER SEEN EACH OTHER UNTIL THE NIGHT BEFORE HAVING MET THROUGH A MATRIMONIAL PAPER
3934-102413-0036 THEY HAD MET IN GREEN RIVER AND WERE MARRIED THAT MORNING AND THE YOUNG HUSBAND WAS TAKING HER AWAY UP TO PINEDALE TO HIS RANCH THEY MUST HAVE BEEN IDEALLY HAPPY FOR THEY HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR MESS BOX AND HAD ONLY A LIGHT LUNCH
3934-102413-0037 THEY HAD ONLY THEIR LAP ROBE FOR BEDDING THEY WERE IN A PREDICAMENT BUT THE GIRL'S CHIEF CONCERN WAS LEST HONEY BUG SHOULD LET THE WOLVES GET HER THOUGH IT IS SCORCHING HOT ON THE DESERT BY DAY THE NIGHTS ARE KEENLY COOL
3934-102413-0038 AND I WAS WONDERING HOW THEY WOULD MANAGE WITH ONLY THEIR LAP ROBE WHEN MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY WHO CANNOT HOLD MALICE MADE A ROUND OF THE CAMP GETTING A BLANKET HERE AND A COAT THERE UNTIL SHE HAD ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE
3934-102413-0039 THEN SHE INVITED THEM TO TAKE THEIR MEALS WITH US UNTIL THEY COULD GET TO WHERE THEY COULD HELP THEMSELVES I THINK WE ALL ENJOYED CAMP THAT NIGHT FOR WE WERE ALL TIRED WE WERE IN A SHALLOW LITTLE CANYON
3934-102413-0040 NOT A TREE NOT EVEN A BUSH EXCEPT SAGE BRUSH LUCKILY THERE WAS PLENTY OF THAT SO WE HAD ROARING FIRES WE SAT AROUND THE FIRE TALKING AS THE BLUE SHADOWS FADED INTO GRAY DUSK AND THE BIG STARS CAME OUT
3934-102413-0041 THE NEWLY WEDS WERE AS THE BRIDE PUT IT SO FULL OF HAPPINESS THEY HAD NOTHING TO PUT IT IN CERTAINLY THEIR SPIRITS OVERFLOWED THEY WERE EAGER TO TALK OF THEMSELVES AND WE DIDN'T MIND LISTENING
3934-102413-0042 THEY ARE MISTER AND MISSUS TOM BURNEY SHE IS THE OLDEST OF A LARGE FAMILY OF CHILDREN AND HAS HAD TO WORK OUT EVER SINCE SHE WAS BIG ENOUGH TO GET A JOB
3934-102413-0043 THE PEOPLE SHE HAD WORKED FOR RATHER FROWNED UPON ANY MATRIMONIAL VENTURES AND AS NO PROVISION WAS MADE FOR HELP ENTERTAINING COMPANY SHE HAD NEVER HAD A BEAU
3934-102413-0044 SHE ANSWERED AND THEY CORRESPONDED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS WE WERE JUST IN TIME TO CATCH IT AS MISTER HAYNES WHO IS A CONFIRMED BACHELOR DISGUSTEDLY REMARKED PERSONALLY I AM GLAD
3934-102413-0045 I LIKE THEM MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT I SHOULD WHEN THEY WERE RAISING SO MUCH DUST SO UNNECESSARILY I MUST CLOSE THIS LETTER AS I SEE THE MEN ARE ABOUT READY TO START
3934-102413-0046 THE CHILDREN ARE STANDING THE TRIP WELL EXCEPT THAT ROBERT IS A LITTLE SUN BLISTERED DID I TELL YOU WE LEFT JUNIOR WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE OTHER THREE MY HEART IS HUNGRY FOR MY BIG BOY
