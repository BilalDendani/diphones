3537-5703-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN DRESS AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE PECUNIARY CULTURE
3537-5703-0001 TO SHOW IN SOME DETAIL HOW THE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES SO FAR SET FORTH APPLY TO EVERYDAY FACTS IN SOME ONE DIRECTION OF THE LIFE PROCESS
3537-5703-0002 ARE ALSO EXEMPLIFIED IN THE SAME CONTRIVANCES OTHER METHODS OF PUTTING ONE'S PECUNIARY STANDING IN EVIDENCE SERVE THEIR END EFFECTUALLY
3537-5703-0003 TO ALL OBSERVERS AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT ADMITTED EXPENDITURE FOR DISPLAY IS MORE OBVIOUSLY PRESENT AND IS PERHAPS MORE UNIVERSALLY PRACTICED IN THE MATTER OF DRESS
3537-5703-0004 AND PROBABLY AT NO OTHER POINT IS THE SENSE OF SHABBINESS SO KEENLY FELT AS IT IS IF WE FALL SHORT OF THE STANDARD SET BY SOCIAL USAGE IN THIS MATTER OF DRESS
3537-5703-0005 IN ORDER TO AFFORD WHAT IS CONSIDERED A DECENT AMOUNT OF WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION SO THAT IT IS BY NO MEANS AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE IN AN INCLEMENT CLIMATE FOR PEOPLE TO GO ILL CLAD IN ORDER TO APPEAR WELL DRESSED
3537-5703-0006 AND THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THE GOODS USED FOR CLOTTING IN ANY MODERN COMMUNITY IS MADE UP TO A MUCH LARGER EXTENT OF THE FASHIONABLENESS THE REPUTABILITY OF THE GOODS
3537-5703-0007 IN THE COMMON RUN OF CASES THE CONSCIOUS MOTIVE OF THE WEARER OR PURCHASER OF CONSPICUOUSLY WASTEFUL APPAREL IS THE NEED OF CONFORMING TO ESTABLISHED USAGE
3537-5703-0008 WITHOUT REFLECTION OR ANALYSIS WE FEEL THAT WHAT IS INEXPENSIVE IS UNWORTHY A CHEAP COAT MAKES A CHEAP MAN CHEAP AND NASTY IS RECOGNIZED TO HOLD TRUE IN DRESS
3537-5703-0009 WITH EVEN LESS MITIGATION THAN IN OTHER LINES OF CONSUMPTION
3537-5703-0010 AN INEXPENSIVE ARTICLE OF APPAREL IS HELD TO BE INFERIOR UNDER THE MAXIM CHEAP AND NASTY WE FIND THINGS BEAUTIFUL AS WELL AS SERVICEABLE SOMEWHAT IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE COSTLY
3537-5703-0011 WITH FEW AND INCONSEQUENTIAL EXCEPTIONS WE ALL FIND A COSTLY HAND WROUGHT ARTICLE OF APPAREL MUCH PREFERABLE IN POINT OF BEAUTY AND OF SERVICEABILITY TO A LESS EXPENSIVE IMITATION OF IT
3537-5703-0012 HOWEVER CLEVERLY THE SPURIOUS ARTICLE MAY IMITATE THE COSTLY ORIGINAL AND WHAT OFFENDS OUR SENSIBILITIES IN THE SPURIOUS ARTICLE IS NOT THAT IT FALLS SHORT IN FORM OR COLOR OR INDEED IN VISUAL EFFECT IN ANY WAY
3537-5703-0013 BECAUSE IT FALLS TO A LOWER PECUNIARY GRADE BUT THE FUNCTION OF DRESS AS AN EVIDENCE OF ABILITY TO PAY
3537-5703-0014 DOES NOT END WITH SIMPLY SHOWING THAT THE WEARER CONSUMES VALUABLE GOODS IN EXCESS OF WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR PHYSICAL COMFORT SIMPLE CONSPICUOUS WASTE OF GOODS IS EFFECTIVE AND GRATIFYING AS FAR AS IT GOES
3537-5703-0015 BUT DRESS HAS SUBTLER AND MORE FAR REACHING POSSIBILITIES THAN THIS CRUDE FIRST HAND EVIDENCE OF WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION ONLY IF IN ADDITION TO SHOWING THAT THE WEARER CAN AFFORD TO CONSUME FREELY AND UNECONOMICALLY
3537-5703-0016 THAT THE WEARER IS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY KIND OF PRODUCTIVE LABOR IN THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS BY WHICH OUR SYSTEM OF DRESS HAS BEEN ELABORATED INTO ITS PRESENT ADMIRABLY PERFECT ADAPTATION TO ITS PURPOSE
3537-5703-0017 WILL SHOW THAT IT IS CONTRIVED AT EVERY POINT TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT THE WEARER DOES NOT HABITUALLY PUT FORTH ANY USEFUL EFFORT IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT NO APPAREL CAN BE CONSIDERED ELEGANT OR EVEN DECENT
3537-5703-0018 OF LEISURE EXEMPTION FROM PERSONAL CONTACT WITH INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES OF ANY KIND MUCH OF THE CHARM THAT INVESTS THE PATENT LEATHER SHOE THE STAINLESS LINEN THE LUSTROUS CYLINDRICAL HAT AND THE WALKING STICK
3537-5703-0019 ELEGANT DRESS SERVES ITS PURPOSE OF ELEGANCE NOT ONLY IN THAT IT IS EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS THE INSIGNIA OF LEISURE IT NOT ONLY SHOWS THAT THE WEARER IS ABLE TO CONSUME A RELATIVELY LARGE VALUE
3537-5703-0020 BUT IT ARGUES AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE CONSUMES WITHOUT PRODUCING THE DRESS OF WOMEN GOES EVEN FARTHER THAN THAT OF MEN IN THE WAY OF DEMONSTRATING THE WEARER'S ABSTINENCE FROM PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT
3537-5703-0021 IT NEEDS NO ARGUMENT TO ENFORCE THE GENERALIZATION THAT THE MORE ELEGANT STYLES OF FEMININE BONNETS GO EVEN FARTHER TOWARDS MAKING WORK IMPOSSIBLE THAN DOES THE MAN'S HIGH HAT
3537-5703-0022 THE WOMAN'S SHOE ADDS THE SO CALLED FRENCH HEEL TO THE EVIDENCE OF ENFORCED LEISURE AFFORDED BY ITS POLISH BECAUSE THIS HIGH HEEL OBVIOUSLY MAKES ANY EVEN THE SIMPLEST AND MOST NECESSARY MANUAL WORK
3537-5703-0023 EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THE LIKE IS TRUE EVEN IN A HIGHER DEGREE OF THE SKIRT AND THE REST OF THE DRAPERY WHICH CHARACTERIZES WOMAN'S DRESS THE SUBSTANTIAL REASON FOR OUR TENACIOUS ATTACHMENT TO THE SKIRT IS JUST THIS
3537-5703-0024 BUT THE WOMAN'S APPAREL NOT ONLY GOES BEYOND THAT OF THE MODERN MAN IN THE DEGREE IN WHICH IT ARGUES EXEMPTION FROM LABOR IT ALSO ADDS A PECULIAR AND HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE WHICH DIFFERS IN KIND
3537-5703-0025 FROM ANYTHING HABITUALLY PRACTICED BY THE MEN THIS FEATURE IS THE CLASS OF CONTRIVANCES OF WHICH THE CORSET IS THE TYPICAL EXAMPLE THE CORSET IS IN ECONOMIC THEORY SUBSTANTIALLY A MUTILATION
3537-5703-0026 UNDERGONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOWERING THE SUBJECT'S VITALITY AND RENDERING HER PERMANENTLY AND OBVIOUSLY UNFIT FOR WORK IT IS TRUE THE CORSET IMPAIRS THE PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS OF THE WEARER
3537-5703-0027 IT MAY BROADLY BE SET DOWN THAT THE WOMANLINESS OF WOMAN'S APPAREL RESOLVES ITSELF IN POINT OF SUBSTANTIAL FACT INTO THE MORE EFFECTIVE HINDRANCE TO USEFUL EXERTION OFFERED BY THE GARMENTS PECULIAR TO WOMEN
3537-5703-0028 AS THE GREAT AND DOMINANT NORM OF DRESS THE BROAD PRINCIPLE OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE SUBSIDIARY TO THIS PRINCIPLE AND AS A COROLLARY UNDER IT WE GET AS A SECOND NORM THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSPICUOUS LEISURE
3537-5703-0029 IT MUST AT THE SAME TIME BE UP TO DATE NO EXPLANATION AT ALL SATISFACTORY HAS HITHERTO BEEN OFFERED OF THE PHENOMENON OF CHANGING FASHIONS THE IMPERATIVE REQUIREMENT OF DRESSING IN THE LATEST ACCREDITED MANNER
3537-5703-0030 WE MAY OF COURSE SAY WITH PERFECT CONSISTENCY AND TRUTHFULNESS THAT THIS PRINCIPLE OF NOVELTY IS ANOTHER COROLLARY UNDER THE LAW OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE OBVIOUSLY
3537-5703-0031 PRETTY MUCH ALL THAT THIS CONSIDERATION WARRANTS US IN SAYING IS THAT THE NORM OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE EXERCISES A CONTROLLING SURVEILLANCE IN ALL MATTERS OF DRESS
3537-5703-0032 IT LEAVES UNANSWERED THE QUESTION AS TO THE MOTIVE FOR MAKING AND ACCEPTING A CHANGE IN THE PREVAILING STYLES AND IT ALSO FAILS TO EXPLAIN WHY CONFORMITY TO A GIVEN STYLE AT A GIVEN TIME
3537-5703-0033 IS SO IMPERATIVELY NECESSARY AS WE KNOW IT TO BE FOR A CREATIVE PRINCIPLE CAPABLE OF SERVING AS MOTIVE TO INVENTION AND INNOVATION IN FASHIONS WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE PRIMITIVE NON ECONOMIC MOTIVE
3537-5703-0034 WITH WHICH APPAREL ORIGINATED THE MOTIVE OF ADORNMENT WITHOUT GOING INTO AN EXTENDED DISCUSSION OF HOW AND WHY THIS MOTIVE ASSERTS ITSELF UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE LAW OF EXPENSIVENESS IT MAY BE STATED BROADLY
3537-5703-0035 THAT EACH SUCCESSIVE INNOVATION IN THE FASHIONS IS AN EFFORT TO REACH SOME FORM OF DISPLAY WHICH SHALL BE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO OUR SENSE OF FORM AND COLOR OR OF EFFECTIVENESS THAN THAT WHICH IT DISPLACES
3537-5703-0036 THE CHANGING STYLES ARE THE EXPRESSION OF A RESTLESS SEARCH FOR SOMETHING WHICH SHALL COMMEND ITSELF TO OUR AESTHETIC SENSE
3537-5703-0037 BUT AS EACH INNOVATION IS SUBJECT TO THE SELECTIVE ACTION OF THE NORM OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE THE RANGE WITHIN WHICH INNOVATION CAN TAKE PLACE IS SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED THE INNOVATION MUST NOT ONLY BE MORE BEAUTIFUL
3537-5703-0038 OR PERHAPS OFTENER LESS OFFENSIVE THAN THAT WHICH IT DISPLACES BUT IT MUST ALSO COME UP TO THE ACCEPTED STANDARD OF EXPENSIVENESS IT WOULD SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT THAT THE RESULT OF SUCH AN UNREMITTING STRUGGLE
3537-5703-0039 TO ATTAIN THE BEAUTIFUL IN DRESS SHOULD BE A GRADUAL APPROACH TO ARTISTIC PERFECTION WE MIGHT NATURALLY EXPECT THAT THE FASHIONS SHOULD SHOW A WELL MARKED TREND
3537-5703-0040 IN THE DIRECTION OF SOME ONE OR MORE TYPES OF APPAREL EMINENTLY BECOMING TO THE HUMAN FORM AND WE MIGHT EVEN FEEL THAT WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL GROUND FOR THE HOPE THAT TODAY AFTER ALL THE INGENUITY AND EFFORT
3537-5703-0041 ON THE OTHER HAND THE ASSERTION FREELY GOES UNCONTRADICTED THAT STYLES IN VOGUE TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO ARE MORE BECOMING THAN THE MOST ELABORATE AND PAINSTAKING CONSTRUCTIONS OF TODAY
3537-5703-0042 HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD AS FOR INSTANCE AMONG THE JAPANESE CHINESE AND OTHER ORIENTAL NATIONS LIKEWISE AMONG THE GREEKS ROMANS AND OTHER EASTERN PEOPLES OF ANTIQUITY
3537-5703-0043 SO ALSO IN LATER TIMES AMONG THE PEASANTS OF NEARLY EVERY COUNTRY OF EUROPE THESE NATIONAL OR POPULAR COSTUMES ARE IN MOST CASES ADJUDGED BY COMPETENT CRITICS TO BE MORE BECOMING MORE ARTISTIC
3537-5703-0044 THAN THE FLUCTUATING STYLES OF MODERN CIVILIZED APPAREL AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE ALSO AT LEAST USUALLY LESS OBVIOUSLY WASTEFUL
3537-5703-0045 ARE MORE READILY DETECTED IN THEIR STRUCTURE THESE RELATIVELY STABLE COSTUMES ARE COMMONLY PRETTY STRICTLY AND NARROWLY LOCALIZED AND THEY VARY BY SLIGHT AND SYSTEMATIC GRADATIONS FROM PLACE TO PLACE
3537-5703-0046 IS RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS STABLE AND IMMOBILE THAT IS TO SAY STABLE COSTUMES WHICH WILL BEAR THE TEST OF TIME AND PERSPECTIVE ARE WORKED OUT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES
3537-5703-0047 THE COUNTRIES AND CLASSES WHICH HAVE IN THIS WAY WORKED OUT STABLE AND ARTISTIC COSTUMES HAVE BEEN SO PLACED THAT THE PECUNIARY EMULATION AMONG THEM HAS TAKEN THE DIRECTION OF A COMPETITION IN CONSPICUOUS LEISURE
3537-5703-0048 RATHER THAN IN CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS SO THAT IT WILL HOLD TRUE IN A GENERAL WAY THAT FASHIONS ARE LEAST STABLE AND LEAST BECOMING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE PRINCIPLE OF A CONSPICUOUS WASTE OF GOODS
3537-5703-0049 ASSERTS ITSELF MOST IMPERATIVELY AS AMONG OURSELVES ALL THIS POINTS TO AN ANTAGONISM BETWEEN EXPENSIVENESS AND ARTISTIC APPAREL IN POINT OF PRACTICAL FACT
3537-5703-0050 NOR THAT OF BEAUTY ALONE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE STANDARD OF REPUTABILITY REQUIRES THAT DRESS SHOULD SHOW WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE BUT ALL WASTEFULNESS IS OFFENSIVE TO NATIVE TASTE
3537-5703-0051 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LAW HAS ALREADY BEEN POINTED OUT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN PERHAPS EVEN IN A HIGHER DEGREE ABHOR FUTILITY WHETHER OF EFFORT OR OF EXPENDITURE
3537-5703-0052 MUCH AS NATURE WAS ONCE SAID TO ABHOR A VACUUM BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE REQUIRES AN OBVIOUSLY FUTILE EXPENDITURE AND THE RESULTING CONSPICUOUS EXPENSIVENESS OF DRESS
3537-5703-0053 IS THEREFORE INTRINSICALLY UGLY HENCE WE FIND THAT IN ALL INNOVATIONS IN DRESS EACH ADDED OR ALTERED DETAIL STRIVES TO AVOID CONDEMNATION BY SHOWING SOME OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE
3537-5703-0054 AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE REQUIREMENT OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE PREVENTS THE PURPOSEFULNESS OF THESE INNOVATIONS FROM BECOMING ANYTHING MORE THAN A SOMEWHAT TRANSPARENT PRETENSE
3537-5703-0055 EVEN IN ITS FREEST FLIGHTS FASHION RARELY IF EVER GETS AWAY FROM A SIMULATION OF SOME OSTENSIBLE USE THE OSTENSIBLE USEFULNESS OF THE FASHIONABLE DETAILS OF DRESS HOWEVER
3537-5703-0056 IS ALWAYS SO TRANSPARENT A MAKE BELIEVE AND THEIR SUBSTANTIAL FUTILITY PRESENTLY FORCES ITSELF SO BALDLY UPON OUR ATTENTION AS TO BECOME UNBEARABLE AND THEN WE TAKE REFUGE IN A NEW STYLE
3537-5703-0057 AND THE ONLY REMEDY WHICH THE LAW OF WASTE ALLOWS US IS TO SEEK RELIEF IN SOME NEW CONSTRUCTION EQUALLY FUTILE AND EQUALLY UNTENABLE
