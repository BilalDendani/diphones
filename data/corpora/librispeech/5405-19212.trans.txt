5405-19212-0000 FOR A LONG TIME MARIUS WAS NEITHER DEAD NOR ALIVE FOR MANY WEEKS HE LAY IN A FEVER ACCOMPANIED BY DELIRIUM AND BY TOLERABLY GRAVE CEREBRAL SYMPTOMS CAUSED MORE BY THE SHOCKS OF THE WOUNDS ON THE HEAD THAN BY THE WOUNDS THEMSELVES
5405-19212-0001 HE REPEATED COSETTE'S NAME FOR WHOLE NIGHTS IN THE MELANCHOLY LOQUACITY OF FEVER AND WITH THE SOMBRE OBSTINACY OF AGONY THE EXTENT OF SOME OF THE LESIONS PRESENTED A SERIOUS DANGER
5405-19212-0002 THE SUPPURATION OF LARGE WOUNDS BEING ALWAYS LIABLE TO BECOME RE ABSORBED AND CONSEQUENTLY TO KILL THE SICK MAN UNDER CERTAIN ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AT EVERY CHANGE OF WEATHER AT THE SLIGHTEST STORM THE PHYSICIAN WAS UNEASY
5405-19212-0003 AT THAT EPOCH NICOLETTE USED UP A SHEET AS BIG AS THE CEILING AS SHE PUT IT FOR LINT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THAT THE CHLORURETTED LOTIONS AND THE NITRATE OF SILVER OVERCAME THE GANGRENE AS LONG AS THERE WAS ANY DANGER
5405-19212-0004 EVERY DAY SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY A VERY WELL DRESSED GENTLEMAN WITH WHITE HAIR SUCH WAS THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY THE PORTER CAME TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE WOUNDED MAN AND LEFT A LARGE PACKAGE OF LINT FOR THE DRESSINGS
5405-19212-0005 FINALLY ON THE SEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER FOUR MONTHS TO A DAY AFTER THE SORROWFUL NIGHT WHEN HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO HIS GRANDFATHER IN A DYING CONDITION THE DOCTOR DECLARED THAT HE WOULD ANSWER FOR MARIUS CONVALESCENCE BEGAN
5405-19212-0006 BUT MARIUS WAS FORCED TO REMAIN FOR TWO MONTHS MORE STRETCHED OUT ON A LONG CHAIR ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESULTS CALLED UP BY THE FRACTURE OF HIS COLLAR BONE THERE ALWAYS IS A LAST WOUND LIKE THAT WHICH WILL NOT CLOSE AND WHICH PROLONGS THE DRESSINGS INDEFINITELY
5405-19212-0007 TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE SICK PERSON HOWEVER THIS LONG ILLNESS AND THIS LONG CONVALESCENCE SAVED HIM FROM ALL PURSUIT
5405-19212-0008 NOT EVEN OF A PUBLIC CHARACTER WHICH SIX MONTHS WILL NOT EXTINGUISH REVOLTS IN THE PRESENT STATE OF SOCIETY ARE SO MUCH THE FAULT OF EVERY ONE THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWED BY A CERTAIN NECESSITY OF SHUTTING THE EYES
5405-19212-0009 THE WOUNDED WERE COVERED AND PROTECTED BY THIS INDIGNATION AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN MADE PRISONERS IN THE VERY ACT OF COMBAT THE COUNCILS OF WAR DID NOT DARE TO TROUBLE ANY ONE SO MARIUS WAS LEFT IN PEACE
5405-19212-0010 AND THEN THROUGH EVERY FORM OF ECSTASY IT WAS FOUND DIFFICULT TO PREVENT HIS PASSING EVERY NIGHT BESIDE THE WOUNDED MAN
5405-19212-0011 HE REQUIRED HIS DAUGHTER TO TAKE THE FINEST LINEN IN THE HOUSE FOR COMPRESSES AND BANDAGES
5405-19212-0012 CONTRIVED TO SPARE THE FINE LINEN WHILE ALLOWING THE GRANDFATHER TO THINK THAT HE WAS OBEYED
5405-19212-0013 THAT FOR THE PREPARATION OF LINT BATISTE IS NOT NEARLY SO GOOD AS COARSE LINEN NOR NEW LINEN AS OLD LINEN HE WAS PRESENT AT ALL THE DRESSINGS OF THE WOUNDS
5405-19212-0014 NOTHING WAS MORE TOUCHING THAN TO SEE HIM WITH HIS GENTLE SENILE PALSY OFFER THE WOUNDED MAN A CUP OF HIS COOLING DRAUGHT HE OVERWHELMED THE DOCTOR WITH QUESTIONS HE DID NOT OBSERVE THAT HE ASKED THE SAME ONES OVER AND OVER AGAIN
5405-19212-0015 ON THE DAY WHEN THE DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO HIM THAT MARIUS WAS OUT OF DANGER
5405-19212-0016 MORE THAN DIANA HERSELF JEANNE AND HER FIRM BRETON BREASTS THEN HE KNELT UPON A CHAIR AND BASQUE WHO WAS WATCHING HIM THROUGH THE HALF OPEN DOOR MADE SURE THAT HE WAS PRAYING UP TO THAT TIME HE HAD NOT BELIEVED IN GOD
5405-19212-0017 AT EACH SUCCEEDING PHASE OF IMPROVEMENT WHICH BECAME MORE AND MORE PRONOUNCED THE GRANDFATHER RAVED HE EXECUTED A MULTITUDE OF MECHANICAL ACTIONS FULL OF JOY HE ASCENDED AND DESCENDED THE STAIRS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY
5405-19212-0018 A PRETTY FEMALE NEIGHBOR WAS AMAZED ONE MORNING AT RECEIVING A BIG BOUQUET
5405-19212-0019 THE HUSBAND MADE A JEALOUS SCENE
5405-19212-0020 EVERY MOMENT HE KEPT ASKING THE DOCTOR IS HE NO LONGER IN DANGER HE GAZED UPON MARIUS WITH THE EYES OF A GRANDMOTHER HE BROODED OVER HIM WHILE HE ATE HE NO LONGER KNEW HIMSELF HE NO LONGER RENDERED HIMSELF AN ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF
5405-19212-0021 MARIUS WAS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS ABDICATION IN HIS JOY HE WAS THE GRANDSON OF HIS GRANDSON IN THE STATE OF JOY IN WHICH HE THEN WAS HE WAS THE MOST VENERABLE OF CHILDREN
5405-19212-0022 IN HIS FEAR LEST HE MIGHT FATIGUE OR ANNOY THE CONVALESCENT HE STEPPED BEHIND HIM TO SMILE HE WAS CONTENT JOYOUS DELIGHTED CHARMING YOUNG HIS WHITE LOCKS ADDED A GENTLE MAJESTY TO THE GAY RADIANCE OF HIS VISAGE
5405-19212-0023 WHEN GRACE IS MINGLED WITH WRINKLES IT IS ADORABLE THERE IS AN INDESCRIBABLE AURORA IN BEAMING OLD AGE AS FOR MARIUS AS HE ALLOWED THEM TO DRESS HIS WOUNDS AND CARE FOR HIM HE HAD BUT ONE FIXED IDEA COSETTE
5405-19212-0024 AFTER THE FEVER AND DELIRIUM HAD LEFT HIM HE DID NOT AGAIN PRONOUNCE HER NAME AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF HER HE HELD HIS PEACE PRECISELY BECAUSE HIS SOUL WAS THERE
5405-19212-0025 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF COSETTE THE WHOLE AFFAIR OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE WAS LIKE A CLOUD IN HIS MEMORY SHADOWS THAT WERE ALMOST INDISTINCT FLOATED THROUGH HIS MIND EPONINE GAVROCHE MABEUF
5405-19212-0026 ALL HIS FRIENDS GLOOMILY INTERMINGLED WITH THE SMOKE OF THE BARRICADE THE STRANGE PASSAGE
5405-19212-0027 HE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING CONNECTED WITH HIS OWN LIFE HE DID NOT KNOW HOW NOR BY WHOM HE HAD BEEN SAVED AND NO ONE OF THOSE AROUND HIM KNEW THIS ALL THAT THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO TELL HIM WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT HOME AT NIGHT IN A HACKNEY COACH
5405-19212-0028 PAST PRESENT FUTURE WERE NOTHING MORE TO HIM THAN THE MIST OF A VAGUE IDEA BUT IN THAT FOG THERE WAS ONE IMMOVABLE POINT ONE CLEAR AND PRECISE OUTLINE SOMETHING MADE OF GRANITE A RESOLUTION A WILL
5405-19212-0029 TO FIND COSETTE ONCE MORE FOR HIM THE IDEA OF LIFE WAS NOT DISTINCT FROM THE IDEA OF COSETTE HE HAD DECREED IN HIS HEART THAT HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER AND HE WAS IMMOVABLY RESOLVED TO EXACT OF ANY PERSON WHATEVER
5405-19212-0030 WHO SHOULD DESIRE TO FORCE HIM TO LIVE FROM HIS GRANDFATHER FROM FATE FROM HELL THE RESTITUTION OF HIS VANISHED EDEN HE DID NOT CONCEAL FROM HIMSELF THE FACT THAT OBSTACLES EXISTED
5405-19212-0031 HE WAS NOT WON OVER AND WAS BUT LITTLE SOFTENED BY ALL THE SOLICITUDE AND TENDERNESS OF HIS GRANDFATHER
5405-19212-0032 THEN IN HIS REVERIES OF AN INVALID WHICH WERE STILL FEVERISH
5405-19212-0033 WHICH HAD FOR ITS OBJECT HIS CONQUEST HE REMAINED COLD THE GRANDFATHER ABSOLUTELY WASTED HIS POOR OLD SMILE
5405-19212-0034 AND LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE BUT THAT WHEN IT BECAME A QUESTION OF COSETTE HE WOULD FIND ANOTHER FACE AND THAT HIS GRANDFATHER'S TRUE ATTITUDE WOULD BE UNMASKED THEN THERE WOULD BE AN UNPLEASANT SCENE A RECRUDESCENCE OF FAMILY QUESTIONS
5405-19212-0035 A CONFRONTATION OF POSITIONS EVERY SORT OF SARCASM AND ALL MANNER OF OBJECTIONS AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME FAUCHELEVENT COUPELEVENT FORTUNE POVERTY A STONE ABOUT HIS NECK THE FUTURE VIOLENT RESISTANCE CONCLUSION
5405-19212-0036 A REFUSAL MARIUS STIFFENED HIMSELF IN ADVANCE AND THEN IN PROPORTION AS HE REGAINED LIFE THE OLD ULCERS OF HIS MEMORY OPENED ONCE MORE HE REFLECTED AGAIN ON THE PAST COLONEL PONTMERCY PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE
5405-19212-0037 MARIUS HE TOLD HIMSELF
5405-19212-0038 WHO HAD BEEN SO UNJUST AND SO HARD TO HIS FATHER
5405-19212-0039 THE OLD MAN WAS GENTLY PAINED BY THIS
5405-19212-0040 AND HAD REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS HAD NOT ONCE CALLED HIM FATHER IT IS TRUE THAT HE DID NOT SAY MONSIEUR TO HIM BUT HE CONTRIVED NOT TO SAY EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER BY MEANS OF A CERTAIN WAY OF TURNING HIS PHRASES OBVIOUSLY A CRISIS WAS APPROACHING
5405-19212-0041 AS ALMOST ALWAYS HAPPENS IN SUCH CASES MARIUS SKIRMISHED BEFORE GIVING BATTLE BY WAY OF PROVING HIMSELF THIS IS CALLED FEELING THE GROUND
5405-19212-0042 APROPOS OF A NEWSPAPER WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO HIS HANDS AND GAVE VENT TO A ROYALIST HARANGUE
5405-19212-0043 THE MEN OF NINETY THREE WERE GIANTS SAID MARIUS WITH SEVERITY THE OLD MAN HELD HIS PEACE AND UTTERED NOT A SOUND DURING THE REMAINDER OF THAT DAY MARIUS WHO HAD ALWAYS PRESENT TO HIS MIND THE INFLEXIBLE GRANDFATHER OF HIS EARLY YEARS
5405-19212-0044 AUGURED FROM IT A HOT CONFLICT AND AUGMENTED HIS PREPARATIONS FOR THE FRAY IN THE INMOST RECESSES OF HIS MIND
