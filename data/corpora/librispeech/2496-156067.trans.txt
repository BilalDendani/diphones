2496-156067-0000 TO MISS HOWE HARLOWE PLACE
2496-156067-0001 I WILL NOW RESUME MY NARRATIVE OF PROCEEDINGS HERE MY BROTHER BEING IN A GOOD WAY ALTHOUGH YOU MAY BE SURE THAT HIS RESENTMENTS ARE RATHER HEIGHTENED
2496-156067-0002 THAN ABATED BY THE GALLING DISGRACE HE HAS RECEIVED MY FRIENDS MY FATHER AND UNCLES HOWEVER IF NOT MY BROTHER AND SISTER BEGIN TO THINK THAT I HAVE BEEN TREATED UNKINDLY
2496-156067-0003 MY MOTHER BEEN SO GOOD AS TO TELL ME THIS SINCE I SENT AWAY MY LAST NEVERTHELESS I BELIEVE THEY ALL THINK THAT I RECEIVE LETTERS FROM MISTER LOVELACE
2496-156067-0004 BUT LORD M BEING INCLINED RATHER TO SUPPORT THAN TO BLAME HIS NEPHEW
2496-156067-0005 THAT THEY DO NOT PUT IT TO ME
2496-156067-0006 CONNIVING ON THE CONTRARY
2496-156067-0007 AT THE ONLY METHOD LEFT TO ALLAY THE VEHEMENCE OF A SPIRIT WHICH THEY HAVE SO MUCH PROVOKED FOR HE STILL INSISTS UPON SATISFACTION FROM MY UNCLES AND THIS POSSIBLY
2496-156067-0008 FOR HE WANTS NOT ART AS THE BEST WAY TO BE INTRODUCED AGAIN WITH SOME ADVANTAGE INTO OUR FAMILY
2496-156067-0009 HAS PUT IT TO MY MOTHER WHETHER IT WERE NOT BEST TO PREVAIL UPON MY BROTHER TO TAKE A TURN TO HIS YORKSHIRE ESTATE WHICH HE WAS INTENDING TO DO BEFORE
2496-156067-0010 BUT THIS IS VERY FAR FROM BEING HIS INTENTION FOR HE HAS ALREADY BEGAN TO HINT AGAIN THAT HE SHALL NEVER BE EASY OR SATISFIED TILL I AM MARRIED
2496-156067-0011 AND FINDING NEITHER MISTER SYMMES NOR MISTER MULLINS WILL BE ACCEPTED HAS PROPOSED MISTER WYERLEY ONCE MORE
2496-156067-0012 AND BUT YESTERDAY HE MENTIONED ONE WHO HAS APPLIED TO HIM BY LETTER MAKING HIGH OFFERS THIS IS MISTER SOLMES RICH SOLMES YOU KNOW THEY CALL HIM
2496-156067-0013 BUT THIS APPLICATION HAS NOT MET WITH THE ATTENTION OF ONE SINGLE SOUL
2496-156067-0014 HE HAS THOUGHTS I AM TOLD OF PROPOSING TO ME TO GO TO SCOTLAND THAT AS THE COMPLIMENT IS I MAY PUT HIS HOUSE THERE IN SUCH ORDER AS OUR OWN IS IN BUT THIS MY MOTHER INTENDS TO OPPOSE FOR HER OWN SAKE
2496-156067-0015 BECAUSE HAVING RELIEVED HER AS SHE IS PLEASED TO SAY OF THE HOUSEHOLD CARES FOR WHICH MY SISTER YOU KNOW HAS NO TURN THEY MUST AGAIN DEVOLVE UPON HER IF I GO AND IF SHE DID NOT OPPOSE IT
2496-156067-0016 I SHOULD FOR BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO MIND TO BE HIS HOUSEKEEPER AND I AM SURE WERE I TO GO WITH HIM I SHOULD BE TREATED RATHER AS A SERVANT THAN A SISTER PERHAPS NOT THE BETTER BECAUSE I AM HIS SISTER
2496-156067-0017 AND IF MISTER LOVELACE SHOULD FOLLOW ME THINGS MIGHT BE WORSE THAN THEY ARE NOW BUT I HAVE BESOUGHT MY MOTHER WHO IS APPREHENSIVE OF MISTER LOVELACE'S VISITS
2496-156067-0018 AND ARMED SERVANTS MY BROTHER ALSO BEING NEAR WELL ENOUGH TO GO ABROAD TO PROCURE ME PERMISSION TO BE YOUR GUEST FOR A FORTNIGHT OR SO WILL YOUR MOTHER THINK YOU MY DEAR GIVE ME LEAVE
2496-156067-0019 I DARE NOT ASK TO GO TO MY DAIRY HOUSE AS MY GOOD GRANDFATHER WOULD CALL IT FOR I AM NOW AFRAID OF BEING THOUGHT TO HAVE A WISH TO ENJOY THAT INDEPENDENCE TO WHICH HIS WILL HAS ENTITLED ME AND AS MATTER ARE SITUATED
2496-156067-0020 TO WHOM THEY HAVE NOW SO GREAT AN ANTIPATHY AND INDEED COULD I BE AS EASY AND HAPPY HERE AS I USED TO BE I WOULD DEFY THAT MAN AND ALL HIS SEX AND NEVER REPENT THAT I HAVE GIVEN THE POWER OF MY FORTUNE
2496-156067-0021 INTO MY FATHER'S HANDS JUST NOW MY MOTHER HAS REJOICED ME WITH THE NEWS THAT MY REQUESTED PERMISSION IS GRANTED EVERY ONE THINKS IT BEST THAT I SHOULD GO TO YOU EXCEPT MY BROTHER
2496-156067-0022 AND TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THIS CONCESSION IN FORM YOU KNOW MY DEAR THAT THERE IS A
2496-156067-0023 SO THAT THEY ARE ADVISED WITH UPON EVERY ARTICLE RELATING TO US OR THAT MAY AFFECT US IT IS THEREFORE THE LESS WONDER AT A TIME WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER LOVELACE IS DETERMINED TO PAY
2496-156067-0024 US AN AMICABLE VISIT AS HE CALLS IT BUT WHICH I AM SURE CANNOT END AMICABLY THAT THEY SHOULD BOTH BE CONSULTED UPON THE PERMISSION I HAD DESIRED TO ATTEND YOU
2496-156067-0025 AND THEIR MOTIVES FOR PERMITTING ME TO GO CLARY SAID MY MOTHER AS SOON AS I ENTERED THE GREAT PARLOUR YOUR REQUEST TO GO TO MISS HOWE'S FOR A FEW DAYS HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND GRANTED
