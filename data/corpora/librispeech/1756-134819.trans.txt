1756-134819-0000 THESE MAIL WAGONS WERE TWO WHEELED CABRIOLETS UPHOLSTERED INSIDE WITH FAWN COLORED LEATHER HUNG ON SPRINGS AND HAVING BUT TWO SEATS ONE FOR THE POSTBOY THE OTHER FOR THE TRAVELLER
1756-134819-0001 THE WHEELS WERE ARMED WITH THOSE LONG OFFENSIVE AXLES WHICH KEEP OTHER VEHICLES AT A DISTANCE AND WHICH MAY STILL BE SEEN ON THE ROAD IN GERMANY THE DESPATCH BOX AN IMMENSE OBLONG COFFER WAS PLACED BEHIND THE VEHICLE AND FORMED A PART OF IT
1756-134819-0002 THIS COFFER WAS PAINTED BLACK AND THE CABRIOLET YELLOW THESE VEHICLES WHICH HAVE NO COUNTERPARTS NOWADAYS HAD SOMETHING DISTORTED AND HUNCHBACKED ABOUT THEM AND WHEN ONE SAW THEM PASSING IN THE DISTANCE AND CLIMBING UP SOME ROAD TO THE HORIZON
1756-134819-0003 THEY RESEMBLED THE INSECTS WHICH ARE CALLED I THINK TERMITES AND WHICH THOUGH WITH BUT LITTLE CORSELET DRAG A GREAT TRAIN BEHIND THEM BUT THEY TRAVELLED AT A VERY RAPID RATE
1756-134819-0004 AFTER THE MAIL FROM PARIS HAD PASSED
1756-134819-0005 JUST AS IT WAS ENTERING THE TOWN WITH A LITTLE TILBURY HARNESSED TO A WHITE HORSE WHICH WAS GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND IN WHICH THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON A MAN ENVELOPED IN A MANTLE THE WHEEL OF THE TILBURY RECEIVED QUITE A VIOLENT SHOCK
1756-134819-0006 THE POSTMAN SHOUTED TO THE MAN TO STOP BUT THE TRAVELLER PAID NO HEED AND PURSUED HIS ROAD AT FULL GALLOP THAT MAN IS IN A DEVILISH HURRY SAID THE POSTMAN THE MAN THUS HASTENING ON WAS THE ONE WHOM WE HAVE JUST SEEN STRUGGLING IN CONVULSIONS WHICH ARE CERTAINLY DESERVING OF PITY
1756-134819-0007 WHITHER WAS HE GOING HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY WAS HE HASTENING HE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS DRIVING AT RANDOM STRAIGHT AHEAD WHITHER
1756-134819-0008 BUT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GOING ELSEWHERE AS WELL AT TIMES HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF IT AND HE SHUDDERED HE PLUNGED INTO THE NIGHT AS INTO A GULF SOMETHING URGED HIM FORWARD SOMETHING DREW HIM ON
1756-134819-0009 NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE WITHIN HIM EVERY ONE WILL UNDERSTAND IT WHAT MAN IS THERE WHO HAS NOT ENTERED AT LEAST ONCE IN HIS LIFE INTO THAT OBSCURE CAVERN OF THE UNKNOWN HOWEVER HE HAD RESOLVED ON NOTHING DECIDED NOTHING FORMED NO PLAN
1756-134819-0010 DONE NOTHING NONE OF THE ACTIONS OF HIS CONSCIENCE HAD BEEN DECISIVE HE WAS MORE THAN EVER AS HE HAD BEEN AT THE FIRST MOMENT
1756-134819-0011 HE REPEATED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY SAID TO HIMSELF WHEN HE HAD HIRED SCAUFFLAIRE'S CABRIOLET THAT WHATEVER THE RESULT WAS TO BE THERE WAS NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES AND JUDGE OF MATTERS FOR HIMSELF THAT THIS WAS EVEN PRUDENT
1756-134819-0012 THAT HE MUST KNOW WHAT TOOK PLACE THAT NO DECISION COULD BE ARRIVED AT WITHOUT HAVING OBSERVED AND SCRUTINIZED THAT ONE MADE MOUNTAINS OUT OF EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THAT AT ANY RATE WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT CHAMPMATHIEU SOME WRETCH
1756-134819-0013 HIS CONSCIENCE WOULD PROBABLY BE GREATLY RELIEVED TO ALLOW HIM TO GO TO THE GALLEYS IN HIS STEAD THAT JAVERT WOULD INDEED BE THERE
1756-134819-0014 OLD CONVICTS WHO HAD KNOWN HIM BUT THEY CERTAINLY WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE HIM BAH WHAT AN IDEA
1756-134819-0015 AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING SO HEADSTRONG AS SUPPOSITIONS AND CONJECTURES THAT ACCORDINGLY THERE WAS NO DANGER THAT IT WAS NO DOUBT A DARK MOMENT
1756-134819-0016 THAT HE WAS MASTER OF IT HE CLUNG TO THIS THOUGHT AT BOTTOM TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH
1756-134819-0017 NEVERTHELESS HE WAS GOING THITHER AS HE MEDITATED HE WHIPPED UP HIS HORSE WHICH WAS PROCEEDING AT THAT FINE REGULAR AND EVEN TROT WHICH ACCOMPLISHES TWO LEAGUES AND A HALF AN HOUR IN PROPORTION AS THE CABRIOLET ADVANCED
1756-134819-0018 HE FELT SOMETHING WITHIN HIM DRAW BACK
1756-134819-0019 BUT WITHOUT SEEING THEM THE MORNING HAS ITS SPECTRES AS WELL AS THE EVENING HE DID NOT SEE THEM BUT WITHOUT HIS BEING AWARE OF IT AND BY MEANS OF A SORT OF PENETRATION WHICH WAS ALMOST PHYSICAL
1756-134819-0020 THESE BLACK SILHOUETTES OF TREES AND OF HILLS ADDED SOME GLOOMY AND SINISTER QUALITY TO THE VIOLENT STATE OF HIS SOUL EACH TIME THAT HE PASSED ONE OF THOSE ISOLATED DWELLINGS WHICH SOMETIMES BORDER ON THE HIGHWAY HE SAID TO HIMSELF
1756-134819-0021 AND YET THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WITHIN WHO ARE SLEEPING THE TROT OF THE HORSE THE BELLS ON THE HARNESS THE WHEELS ON THE ROAD PRODUCED A GENTLE MONOTONOUS NOISE THESE THINGS ARE CHARMING WHEN ONE IS JOYOUS AND LUGUBRIOUS WHEN ONE IS SAD
1756-134819-0022 IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT WHEN HE ARRIVED AT HESDIN HE HALTED IN FRONT OF THE INN TO ALLOW THE HORSE A BREATHING SPELL AND TO HAVE HIM GIVEN SOME OATS THE HORSE BELONGED AS SCAUFFLAIRE HAD SAID TO THAT SMALL RACE OF THE BOULONNAIS WHICH HAS TOO MUCH HEAD
1756-134819-0023 TOO MUCH BELLY AND NOT ENOUGH NECK AND SHOULDERS BUT WHICH HAS A BROAD CHEST A LARGE CRUPPER THIN FINE LEGS AND SOLID HOOFS A HOMELY BUT A ROBUST AND HEALTHY RACE THE EXCELLENT BEAST HAD TRAVELLED FIVE LEAGUES IN TWO HOURS
1756-134819-0024 AND HAD NOT A DROP OF SWEAT ON HIS LOINS HE DID NOT GET OUT OF THE TILBURY THE STABLEMAN WHO BROUGHT THE OATS SUDDENLY BENT DOWN AND EXAMINED THE LEFT WHEEL ARE YOU GOING FAR IN THIS CONDITION SAID THE MAN
1756-134819-0025 HE REPLIED WITH AN AIR OF NOT HAVING ROUSED HIMSELF FROM HIS REVERY WHY HAVE YOU COME FROM A GREAT DISTANCE WENT ON THE MAN FIVE LEAGUES AH WHY DO YOU SAY AH THE MAN BENT DOWN ONCE MORE
1756-134819-0026 WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE WHEEL THEN HE ROSE ERECT AND SAID BECAUSE THOUGH THIS WHEEL HAS TRAVELLED FIVE LEAGUES IT CERTAINLY WILL NOT TRAVEL ANOTHER QUARTER OF A LEAGUE HE SPRANG OUT OF THE TILBURY WHAT IS THAT YOU SAY MY FRIEND
1756-134819-0027 JUST SEE HERE THE WHEEL REALLY HAD SUFFERED SERIOUS DAMAGE THE SHOCK ADMINISTERED BY THE MAIL WAGON HAD SPLIT TWO SPOKES AND STRAINED THE HUB SO THAT THE NUT NO LONGER HELD FIRM MY FRIEND HE SAID TO THE STABLEMAN
1756-134819-0028 CERTAINLY SIR DO ME THE SERVICE TO GO AND FETCH HIM HE IS ONLY A STEP FROM HERE HEY MASTER BOURGAILLARD MASTER BOURGAILLARD THE WHEELWRIGHT WAS STANDING ON HIS OWN THRESHOLD HE CAME EXAMINED THE WHEEL

1756-134819-0030 IN A VERY GREAT HURRY I MUST SET OUT AGAIN IN AN HOUR AT THE LATEST IMPOSSIBLE SIR I WILL PAY WHATEVER YOU ASK IMPOSSIBLE WELL IN TWO HOURS THEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DAY TWO NEW SPOKES AND A HUB MUST BE MADE
1756-134819-0031 MONSIEUR WILL NOT BE ABLE TO START BEFORE TO MORROW MORNING THE MATTER CANNOT WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHAT IF YOU WERE TO REPLACE THIS WHEEL INSTEAD OF REPAIRING IT HOW SO
1756-134819-0032 CERTAINLY SIR HAVE YOU NOT A WHEEL THAT YOU CAN SELL ME THEN I COULD START AGAIN AT ONCE A SPARE WHEEL YES I HAVE NO WHEEL ON HAND THAT WOULD FIT YOUR CABRIOLET TWO WHEELS MAKE A PAIR TWO WHEELS CANNOT BE PUT TOGETHER HAP HAZARD
1756-134819-0033 IN THAT CASE SELL ME A PAIR OF WHEELS NOT ALL WHEELS FIT ALL AXLES SIR TRY NEVERTHELESS IT IS USELESS SIR I HAVE NOTHING TO SELL BUT CART WHEELS WE ARE BUT A POOR COUNTRY HERE
1756-134819-0034 HAVE YOU A CABRIOLET THAT YOU CAN LET ME HAVE THE WHEELWRIGHT HAD SEEN AT THE FIRST GLANCE THAT THE TILBURY WAS A HIRED VEHICLE HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS YOU TREAT THE CABRIOLETS THAT PEOPLE LET YOU SO WELL IF I HAD ONE I WOULD NOT LET IT TO YOU
1756-134819-0035 WELL SELL IT TO ME THEN I HAVE NONE WHAT NOT EVEN A SPRING CART I AM NOT HARD TO PLEASE AS YOU SEE WE LIVE IN A POOR COUNTRY THERE IS IN TRUTH ADDED THE WHEELWRIGHT
1756-134819-0036 AN OLD CALASH UNDER THE SHED YONDER WHICH BELONGS TO A BOURGEOIS OF THE TOWN WHO GAVE IT TO ME TO TAKE CARE OF AND WHO ONLY USES IT ON THE THIRTY SIXTH OF THE MONTH NEVER THAT IS TO SAY I MIGHT LET THAT TO YOU FOR WHAT MATTERS IT TO ME
1756-134819-0037 BUT THE BOURGEOIS MUST NOT SEE IT PASS AND THEN IT IS A CALASH IT WOULD REQUIRE TWO HORSES I WILL TAKE TWO POST HORSES WHERE IS MONSIEUR GOING
1756-134819-0038 AND MONSIEUR WISHES TO REACH THERE TO DAY YES OF COURSE BY TAKING TWO POST HORSES WHY NOT DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER MONSIEUR ARRIVES AT FOUR O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING CERTAINLY NOT THERE IS ONE THING TO BE SAID ABOUT THAT YOU SEE
1756-134819-0039 BY TAKING POST HORSES MONSIEUR HAS HIS PASSPORT YES WELL BY TAKING POST HORSES MONSIEUR CANNOT REACH ARRAS BEFORE TO MORROW WE ARE ON A CROSS ROAD THE RELAYS ARE BADLY SERVED THE HORSES ARE IN THE FIELDS
1756-134819-0040 THE SEASON FOR PLOUGHING IS JUST BEGINNING HEAVY TEAMS ARE REQUIRED AND HORSES ARE SEIZED UPON EVERYWHERE FROM THE POST AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE MONSIEUR WILL HAVE TO WAIT THREE OR FOUR HOURS
1756-134819-0041 AND THEN THEY DRIVE AT A WALK THERE ARE MANY HILLS TO ASCEND COME THEN I WILL GO ON HORSEBACK UNHARNESS THE CABRIOLET SOME ONE CAN SURELY SELL ME A SADDLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT DOUBT BUT WILL THIS HORSE BEAR THE SADDLE
1756-134819-0042 THAT IS TRUE YOU REMIND ME OF THAT HE WILL NOT BEAR IT THEN BUT I CAN SURELY HIRE A HORSE IN THE VILLAGE
1756-134819-0043 YES THAT WOULD REQUIRE SUCH A HORSE AS DOES NOT EXIST IN THESE PARTS YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUY IT TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS YOU BUT YOU WILL NOT FIND ONE FOR SALE NOR TO LET FOR FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS OR FOR A THOUSAND WHAT AM I TO DO
1756-134819-0044 THE BEST THING IS TO LET ME REPAIR THE WHEEL LIKE AN HONEST MAN AND SET OUT ON YOUR JOURNEY TO MORROW TO MORROW WILL BE TOO LATE THE DEUCE IS THERE NOT A MAIL WAGON WHICH RUNS TO ARRAS WHEN WILL IT PASS TO NIGHT
1756-134819-0045 BOTH THE POSTS PASS AT NIGHT THE ONE GOING AS WELL AS THE ONE COMING WHAT IT WILL TAKE YOU A DAY TO MEND THIS WHEEL A DAY AND A GOOD LONG ONE IF YOU SET TWO MEN TO WORK IF I SET TEN MEN TO WORK WHAT IF THE SPOKES WERE TO BE TIED TOGETHER WITH ROPES
1756-134819-0046 THAT COULD BE DONE WITH THE SPOKES NOT WITH THE HUB AND THE FELLY IS IN A BAD STATE TOO IS THERE ANY ONE IN THIS VILLAGE WHO LETS OUT TEAMS NO IS THERE ANOTHER WHEELWRIGHT THE STABLEMAN AND THE WHEELWRIGHT REPLIED IN CONCERT WITH A TOSS OF THE HEAD NO
1756-134819-0047 HE FELT AN IMMENSE JOY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT PROVIDENCE WAS INTERVENING THAT IT WAS IT WHO HAD BROKEN THE WHEEL OF THE TILBURY AND WHO WAS STOPPING HIM ON THE ROAD HE HAD NOT YIELDED TO THIS SORT OF FIRST SUMMONS
1756-134819-0048 HE HAD JUST MADE EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT TO CONTINUE THE JOURNEY HE HAD LOYALLY AND SCRUPULOUSLY EXHAUSTED ALL MEANS HE HAD BEEN DETERRED NEITHER BY THE SEASON NOR FATIGUE NOR BY THE EXPENSE HE HAD NOTHING WITH WHICH TO REPROACH HIMSELF
1756-134819-0049 HE BREATHED AGAIN HE BREATHED FREELY AND TO THE FULL EXTENT OF HIS LUNGS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE JAVERT'S VISIT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE HAND OF IRON WHICH HAD HELD HIS HEART IN ITS GRASP FOR THE LAST TWENTY HOURS HAD JUST RELEASED HIM IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT GOD WAS FOR HIM NOW
1756-134819-0050 AND WAS MANIFESTING HIMSELF HE SAID HIMSELF THAT HE HAD DONE ALL HE COULD AND THAT NOW HE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT RETRACE HIS STEPS QUIETLY IF HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE WHEELWRIGHT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A CHAMBER OF THE INN
1756-134819-0051 NO ONE WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM THINGS WOULD HAVE RESTED THERE AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO RELATE ANY OF THE OCCURRENCES WHICH THE READER IS ABOUT TO PERUSE BUT THIS CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE STREET ANY COLLOQUY IN THE STREET INEVITABLY ATTRACTS A CROWD
1756-134819-0052 THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO ASK NOTHING BETTER THAN TO BECOME SPECTATORS WHILE HE WAS QUESTIONING THE WHEELWRIGHT
1756-134819-0053 AFTER LISTENING FOR A FEW MINUTES A YOUNG LAD TO WHOM NO ONE HAD PAID ANY HEED DETACHED HIMSELF FROM THE GROUP AND RAN OFF
1756-134819-0054 THIS CHILD RETURNED HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN OLD WOMAN MONSIEUR SAID THE WOMAN MY BOY TELLS ME THAT YOU WISH TO HIRE A CABRIOLET THESE SIMPLE WORDS UTTERED BY AN OLD WOMAN LED BY A CHILD MADE THE PERSPIRATION TRICKLE DOWN HIS LIMBS
1756-134819-0055 HE THOUGHT THAT HE BEHELD THE HAND WHICH HAD RELAXED ITS GRASP REAPPEAR IN THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM READY TO SEIZE HIM ONCE MORE HE ANSWERED YES MY GOOD WOMAN I AM IN SEARCH OF A CABRIOLET WHICH I CAN HIRE AND HE HASTENED TO ADD BUT THERE IS NONE IN THE PLACE
1756-134819-0056 CERTAINLY THERE IS SAID THE OLD WOMAN WHERE INTERPOLATED THE WHEELWRIGHT AT MY HOUSE REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN HE SHUDDERED THE FATAL HAND HAD GRASPED HIM AGAIN THE OLD WOMAN REALLY HAD IN HER SHED A SORT OF BASKET SPRING CART
1756-134819-0057 THE WHEELWRIGHT AND THE STABLE MAN IN DESPAIR AT THE PROSPECT OF THE TRAVELLER ESCAPING THEIR CLUTCHES INTERFERED IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL OLD TRAP
1756-134819-0058 THE WHEELS WERE RUSTED AND EATEN WITH MOISTURE IT WOULD NOT GO MUCH FURTHER THAN THE TILBURY A REGULAR RAMSHACKLE OLD STAGE WAGON THE GENTLEMAN WOULD MAKE A GREAT MISTAKE IF HE TRUSTED HIMSELF TO IT
1756-134819-0059 ALL THIS WAS TRUE BUT THIS TRAP THIS RAMSHACKLE OLD VEHICLE THIS THING WHATEVER IT WAS
1756-134819-0060 HE PAID WHAT WAS ASKED LEFT THE TILBURY WITH THE WHEELWRIGHT TO BE REPAIRED INTENDING TO RECLAIM IT ON HIS RETURN HAD THE WHITE HORSE PUT TO THE CART CLIMBED INTO IT AND RESUMED THE ROAD WHICH HE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING SINCE MORNING
1756-134819-0061 AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE CART MOVED OFF HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD FELT A MOMENT PREVIOUSLY A CERTAIN JOY IN THE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD NOT GO WHITHER HE WAS NOW PROCEEDING HE EXAMINED THIS JOY WITH A SORT OF WRATH AND FOUND IT ABSURD
1756-134819-0062 WHY SHOULD HE FEEL JOY AT TURNING BACK AFTER ALL HE WAS TAKING THIS TRIP OF HIS OWN FREE WILL NO ONE WAS FORCING HIM TO IT AND ASSUREDLY NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN EXCEPT WHAT HE SHOULD CHOOSE AS HE LEFT HESDIN HE HEARD A VOICE SHOUTING TO HIM STOP STOP
1756-134819-0063 IT WAS THE OLD WOMAN'S LITTLE BOY MONSIEUR SAID THE LATTER IT WAS I WHO GOT THE CART FOR YOU WELL YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN ME ANYTHING HE WHO GAVE TO ALL SO READILY THOUGHT THIS DEMAND EXORBITANT AND ALMOST ODIOUS
1756-134819-0064 AH IT'S YOU YOU SCAMP SAID HE YOU SHALL HAVE NOTHING HE WHIPPED UP HIS HORSE AND SET OFF AT FULL SPEED HE HAD LOST A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AT HESDIN HE WANTED TO MAKE IT GOOD THE LITTLE HORSE WAS COURAGEOUS AND PULLED FOR TWO
1756-134819-0065 BUT IT WAS THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY THERE HAD BEEN RAIN THE ROADS WERE BAD AND THEN IT WAS NO LONGER THE TILBURY THE CART WAS VERY HEAVY AND IN ADDITION THERE WERE MANY ASCENTS HE TOOK NEARLY FOUR HOURS TO GO FROM HESDIN TO SAINT POL
1756-134819-0066 FOUR HOURS FOR FIVE LEAGUES AT SAINT POL HE HAD THE HORSE UNHARNESSED AT THE FIRST INN HE CAME TO AND LED TO THE STABLE AS HE HAD PROMISED SCAUFFLAIRE
1756-134819-0067 DOES NOT MONSIEUR WISH TO BREAKFAST COME THAT IS TRUE I EVEN HAVE A GOOD APPETITE HE FOLLOWED THE WOMAN WHO HAD A ROSY CHEERFUL FACE SHE LED HIM TO THE PUBLIC ROOM WHERE THERE WERE TABLES COVERED WITH WAXED CLOTH
1756-134819-0068 MAKE HASTE SAID HE I MUST START AGAIN I AM IN A HURRY A BIG FLEMISH SERVANT MAID PLACED HIS KNIFE AND FORK IN ALL HASTE HE LOOKED AT THE GIRL WITH A SENSATION OF COMFORT
1756-134819-0069 HIS BREAKFAST WAS SERVED HE SEIZED THE BREAD TOOK A MOUTHFUL AND THEN SLOWLY REPLACED IT ON THE TABLE AND DID NOT TOUCH IT AGAIN A CARTER WAS EATING AT ANOTHER TABLE HE SAID TO THIS MAN WHY IS THEIR BREAD SO BITTER HERE
1756-134819-0070 THE CARTER WAS A GERMAN AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM HE RETURNED TO THE STABLE AND REMAINED NEAR THE HORSE
1756-134819-0071 WHAT DID HE DO DURING THIS JOURNEY OF WHAT WAS HE THINKING
1756-134819-0072 THIS IS A SORT OF CONTEMPLATION WHICH SOMETIMES SUFFICES TO THE SOUL AND ALMOST RELIEVES IT FROM THOUGHT
1756-134819-0073 TO TRAVEL IS TO BE BORN AND TO DIE AT EVERY INSTANT PERHAPS IN THE VAGUEST REGION OF HIS MIND HE DID MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE SHIFTING HORIZON AND OUR HUMAN EXISTENCE ALL THE THINGS OF LIFE ARE PERPETUALLY FLEEING BEFORE US THE DARK AND BRIGHT INTERVALS ARE INTERMINGLED
1756-134819-0074 AFTER A DAZZLING MOMENT AN ECLIPSE WE LOOK WE HASTEN WE STRETCH OUT OUR HANDS TO GRASP WHAT IS PASSING EACH EVENT IS A TURN IN THE ROAD AND ALL AT ONCE WE ARE OLD WE FEEL A SHOCK ALL IS BLACK WE DISTINGUISH AN OBSCURE DOOR
1756-134819-0075 THE GLOOMY HORSE OF LIFE WHICH HAS BEEN DRAWING US HALTS AND WE SEE A VEILED AND UNKNOWN PERSON UNHARNESSING AMID THE SHADOWS
1756-134819-0076 IT IS TRUE THAT THE DAYS WERE STILL SHORT
1756-134819-0077 RAISED HIS HEAD AND SAID TO HIM THAT HORSE IS VERY MUCH FATIGUED THE POOR BEAST WAS IN FACT GOING AT A WALK ARE YOU GOING TO ARRAS ADDED THE ROAD MENDER YES IF YOU GO ON AT THAT RATE YOU WILL NOT ARRIVE VERY EARLY
1756-134819-0078 HE STOPPED HIS HORSE AND ASKED THE LABORER
1756-134819-0079 NEARLY SEVEN GOOD LEAGUES HOW IS THAT THE POSTING GUIDE ONLY SAYS FIVE LEAGUES AND A QUARTER AH RETURNED THE ROAD MENDER SO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THE ROAD IS UNDER REPAIR YOU WILL FIND IT BARRED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FURTHER ON THERE IS NO WAY TO PROCEED FURTHER REALLY
1756-134819-0080 YOU WILL TAKE THE ROAD ON THE LEFT LEADING TO CARENCY YOU WILL CROSS THE RIVER WHEN YOU REACH CAMBLIN YOU WILL TURN TO THE RIGHT
1756-134819-0081 YOU DO NOT BELONG IN THESE PARTS NO AND BESIDES IT IS ALL CROSS ROADS STOP SIR RESUMED THE ROAD MENDER SHALL I GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE YOUR HORSE IS TIRED
1756-134819-0082 THERE IS A GOOD INN THERE SLEEP THERE YOU CAN REACH ARRAS TO MORROW I MUST BE THERE THIS EVENING THAT IS DIFFERENT BUT GO TO THE INN ALL THE SAME AND GET AN EXTRA HORSE THE STABLE BOY WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE CROSS ROADS HE FOLLOWED THE ROAD MENDER'S ADVICE
1756-134819-0083 RETRACED HIS STEPS AND HALF AN HOUR LATER HE PASSED THE SAME SPOT AGAIN BUT THIS TIME AT FULL SPEED WITH A GOOD HORSE TO AID A STABLE BOY WHO CALLED HIMSELF A POSTILION WAS SEATED ON THE SHAFT OF THE CARIOLE STILL HE FELT THAT HE HAD LOST TIME
1756-134819-0084 NIGHT HAD FULLY COME THEY TURNED INTO THE CROSS ROAD THE WAY BECAME FRIGHTFULLY BAD THE CART LURCHED FROM ONE RUT TO THE OTHER HE SAID TO THE POSTILION KEEP AT A TROT AND YOU SHALL HAVE A DOUBLE FEE IN ONE OF THE JOLTS THE WHIFFLE TREE BROKE
1756-134819-0085 THERE'S THE WHIFFLE TREE BROKEN SIR SAID THE POSTILION I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HARNESS MY HORSE NOW THIS ROAD IS VERY BAD AT NIGHT
1756-134819-0086 HE REPLIED HAVE YOU A BIT OF ROPE AND A KNIFE YES SIR HE CUT A BRANCH FROM A TREE AND MADE A WHIFFLE TREE OF IT THIS CAUSED ANOTHER LOSS OF TWENTY MINUTES BUT THEY SET OUT AGAIN AT A GALLOP THE PLAIN WAS GLOOMY
1756-134819-0087 LOW HANGING BLACK CRISP FOGS CREPT OVER THE HILLS AND WRENCHED THEMSELVES AWAY LIKE SMOKE THERE WERE WHITISH GLEAMS IN THE CLOUDS A STRONG BREEZE WHICH BLEW IN FROM THE SEA PRODUCED A SOUND IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE HORIZON AS OF SOME ONE MOVING FURNITURE
1756-134819-0088 EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE SEEN ASSUMED ATTITUDES OF TERROR HOW MANY THINGS SHIVER BENEATH THESE VAST BREATHS OF THE NIGHT HE WAS STIFF WITH COLD
1756-134819-0089 EIGHT YEARS PREVIOUSLY AND IT SEEMED BUT YESTERDAY THE HOUR STRUCK FROM A DISTANT TOWER HE ASKED THE BOY WHAT TIME IS IT SEVEN O'CLOCK SIR
1756-134819-0090 AT THAT MOMENT HE FOR THE FIRST TIME INDULGED IN THIS REFLECTION THINKING IT ODD THE WHILE THAT IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM SOONER THAT ALL THIS TROUBLE WHICH HE WAS TAKING WAS PERHAPS USELESS THAT HE DID NOT KNOW SO MUCH AS THE HOUR OF THE TRIAL
1756-134819-0091 THAT HE WAS FOOLISH TO GO THUS STRAIGHT AHEAD WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER HE WOULD BE OF ANY SERVICE OR NOT THEN HE SKETCHED OUT SOME CALCULATIONS IN HIS MIND THAT ORDINARILY THE SITTINGS OF THE COURT OF ASSIZES BEGAN AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THAT IT COULD NOT BE A LONG AFFAIR
1756-134819-0092 THAT THE THEFT OF THE APPLES WOULD BE VERY BRIEF THAT THERE WOULD THEN REMAIN ONLY A QUESTION OF IDENTITY FOUR OR FIVE DEPOSITIONS
1756-134819-0093 THAT HE SHOULD ARRIVE AFTER ALL WAS OVER
