2341-151701-0000 LAY OVER THE GREAT PRISON HERE AND THERE IN THE GRIM CORRIDORS A GUARD DOZED IN THE GLARE OF AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND IN THE OFFICE TOO A DESK LIGHT
2341-151701-0001 PORING OVER A REPORT ONCE HE GLANCED UP AT THE CLOCK IT WAS FIVE MINUTES OF ELEVEN AND THEN HE WENT ON WITH HIS READING AFTER A LITTLE THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN BY THE WHIR OF THE CLOCK
2341-151701-0002 AND THE FIRST SHARP STROKE OF THE HOUR AND AT JUST THAT MOMENT THE DOOR FROM THE STREET OPENED AND A MAN ENTERED HE WAS RATHER TALL AND SLENDER
2341-151701-0003 FOR A BARE FRACTION OF A SECOND THE TWO MEN STARED AT EACH OTHER THEN INSTINCTIVELY THE WARDEN'S RIGHT HAND MOVED TOWARD THE OPEN DRAWER OF HIS DESK WHERE A REVOLVER LAY
2341-151701-0004 AND HIS LEFT TOWARD SEVERAL ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED LEVERS THE INTRUDER NOTED BOTH GESTURES AND UNARMED HIMSELF STOOD SILENT THE WARDEN WAS FIRST TO SPEAK WELL WHAT IS IT

2341-151701-0011 HE STILL HELD THE REVOLVER AS HE ADVANCED UPON THE MASKED MAN THREATENINGLY NOT TOO CLOSE NOW
2341-151701-0012 WITH A SUDDEN HARDENING OF HIS VOICE BELIEVE ME

2341-151701-0024 HE TOOK ONE STEP FORWARD AND RAISED THE EMPTY REVOLVER TO STRIKE THE MASKED MAN MOVED SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE AND HIS CLENCHED FIST CAUGHT THE WARDEN ON THE POINT OF THE CHIN
2341-151701-0025 THE OFFICIAL WENT DOWN WITHOUT A SOUND AND LAY STILL INERT A MOMENT LATER THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE CORRIDOR OF THE PRISON OPENED
2341-151701-0026 THE MASKED MAN GLANCED AROUND AT THEM AND WITH A MOTION OF HIS HEAD INDICATED THE DOOR LEADING TO THE STREET THEY PASSED THROUGH CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND THEM FOR A LITTLE TIME THE INTRUDER STOOD STARING DOWN AT THE STILL BODY
2341-151701-0027 THERE HAS BEEN A JAIL DELIVERY AT THE PRISON HE SAID IN ANSWER TO THE HELLO OF THE DESK SERGEANT AT THE OTHER END OF THE WIRE BETTER SEND SOME OF YOUR MEN UP TO INVESTIGATE
2341-151701-0028 THE STRANGER REPLACED THE RECEIVER ON THE HOOK STRIPPED OFF HIS BLACK MASK DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR BESIDE THE MOTIONLESS WARDEN AND WENT OUT
