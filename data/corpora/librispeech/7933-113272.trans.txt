7933-113272-0013 SHE CAUGHT A VIEW OF HIS FACE AND THEN SHE KNEW THAT THE FIGURE WAS HER OWN GRANDFATHER AND THAT CRAZED BY THE GAMBLING SCENE HE HIMSELF HAD ROBBED HER ALL THAT NIGHT LITTLE NELL LAY AND CRIED SHE KNEW TO BE SURE
7933-113272-0014 THAT HER GRANDFATHER WAS NOT A THIEF AND THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING WHEN HE STOLE HER MONEY BUT SHE KNEW TOO THAT IF PEOPLE FOUND OUT HE WAS CRAZY THEY WOULD TAKE HIM AWAY FROM HER AND SHUT HIM UP WHERE SHE COULD NOT BE WITH HIM AND OF THIS SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK
7933-113272-0015 HE GAMBLED AWAY FOR OFTEN HE WAS OUT ALL NIGHT AND EVEN SEEMED TO SHUN HER SO SHE WAS SAD AND TOOK MANY LONG WALKS ALONE THROUGH THE FIELDS ONE EVENING IT HAPPENED THAT SHE PASSED A MEADOW WHERE BESIDE A HEDGE A FIRE WAS BURNING
7933-113272-0016 WITH THREE MEN SITTING AND LYING AROUND IT SHE WAS IN THE SHADOW AND THEY DID NOT SEE HER ONE SHE SAW WAS HER GRANDFATHER AND THE OTHERS WERE THE GAMBLERS WITH WHOM HE HAD PLAYED AT THE INN ON THE NIGHT OF THE STORM
7933-113272-0017 LITTLE NELL CREPT CLOSE THEY WERE TEMPTING THE POOR DAFT OLD MAN TO STEAL THE MONEY FROM MISSUS JARLEY'S STRONG BOX AND WHILE SHE LISTENED HE CONSENTED SHE RAN HOME IN TERRIBLE GRIEF SHE TRIED TO SLEEP BUT COULD NOT

7933-113272-0021 AND WHEN THEY AWOKE IN THE AFTERNOON SOME ROUGH CANAL MEN TOOK THEM ABOARD THEIR DIRTY CRAFT AS FAR AS THE NEXT TOWN THE MEN WERE WELL MEANING ENOUGH AND MEANT THE TRAVELERS NO HARM BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY BEGAN TO DRINK AND QUARRELED AND FOUGHT AMONG THEMSELVES
7933-113272-0022 AND LITTLE NELL SAT ALL NIGHT WET WITH THE RAIN AND SANG TO THEM TO QUIET THEM THE PLACE TO WHICH THEY FINALLY CAME WAS A TOWN OF WRETCHED WORKMEN WHO TOILED ALL DAY IN IRON FURNACES FOR LITTLE WAGES AND WERE ALMOST AS MISERABLE AND HUNGRY AS THE WANDERERS THEMSELVES
7933-113272-0023 NO ONE GAVE THEM ANYTHING AND THEY LIVED FOR THREE DAYS WITH ONLY TWO PENNY LOAVES TO EAT FOR ALL THEIR MONEY WAS NOW GONE AND SLEPT AT NIGHT IN THE ASHES OF SOME POOR LABORER'S HUT THE FOURTH DAY THEY DRAGGED THEMSELVES INTO THE COUNTRY AGAIN
7933-113272-0024 LITTLE NELL'S SHOES WERE WORN THROUGH TO THE BARE GROUND HER FEET WERE BLEEDING HER LIMBS ACHED AND SHE WAS DEADLY FAINT THEY BEGGED BUT NO ONE WOULD HELP THEM THE CHILD'S STRENGTH WAS ALMOST GONE WHEN THEY MET A TRAVELER WHO WAS READING IN A BOOK AS HE WALKED ALONG
7933-113272-0025 HE LOOKED UP AS THEY CAME NEAR IT WAS THE KIND OLD SCHOOLMASTER IN WHOSE SCHOOL THEY HAD SLEPT BEFORE THEY MET MISSUS JARLEY IN HER HOUSE ON WHEELS WHEN SHE SAW HIM LITTLE NELL SHRIEKED AND FELL UNCONSCIOUS AT HIS FEET
7933-113272-0026 THE SCHOOLMASTER CARRIED HER TO AN INN NEAR BY WHERE SHE WAS PUT TO BED AND DOCTORED UNDER HIS CARE FOR SHE WAS VERY WEAK SHE TOLD HIM ALL THE STORY OF THEIR WANDERINGS
7933-113272-0027 AND HE HEARD IT WITH ASTONISHMENT AND WONDER TO FIND SUCH A GREAT HEART AND HEROISM IN A CHILD HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED SCHOOLMASTER HE TOLD HER IN ANOTHER TOWN TO WHICH HE WAS THEN ON HIS WAY AND HE DECLARED THEY SHOULD GO WITH HIM AND HE WOULD CARE FOR THEM
