2230-124587-0000 GONE AT PRECISELY EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING OF THIS IDENTICAL MONDAY JULY SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR OLD JONATHAN PERRY SAT TRANQUILLY SMOKING HIS PIPE AT THE DOOR OF THE TOLL GATE TWO MILES NORTH OF MILLBROOK
2230-124587-0001 THE ATMOSPHERE WAS TOO WARM TO ADMIT OF THE WEARING OF ANY GREAT DISPLAY OF APPAREL
2230-124587-0002 HE WAS AN INVETERATE OLD GOSSIP AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE BUSINESS OF EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HE KNEW ALL ABOUT THE BARGAIN ENTERED INTO BETWEEN SAVAREEN AND SQUIRE HARRINGTON AND HOW IT WAS TO BE CONSUMMATED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
2230-124587-0003 SAVAREEN WHEN RIDING TOWNWARDS THAT MORNING HAD INFORMED HIM OF THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF HIS JOURNEY AND IT NOW SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO THE OLD MAN TO WONDER WHY THE YOUNG FARMER HAD NOT RETURNED HOME WHILE HE SAT THERE PONDERING
2230-124587-0004 THE FIRST STROKE OF THE TOWN BELL PROCLAIMING THE HOUR WAS BORNE UPON HIS EAR BEFORE THE RINGING HAD CEASED HE CAUGHT THE ADDITIONAL SOUND OF A HORSE'S HOOFS RAPIDLY ADVANCING UP THE ROAD AH SAID HE TO HIMSELF HERE HE COMES
2230-124587-0005 I RECKON HIS WIFE'LL BE APT TO GIVE HIM FITS FOR BEING SO LATE IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE HORSEMAN DREW UP BEFORE HIM BUT ONLY TO EXCHANGE A WORD OF GREETING AS THE GATE WAS THROWN WIDE OPEN AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO BAR HIS PROGRESS THE VENERABLE GATE KEEPER HAD CONJECTURED RIGHT
2230-124587-0006 IT WAS SAVAREEN ON HIS BLACK MARE WELL JONATHAN A NICE EVENING REMARKED THE YOUNG FARMER YES MISTER SAVAREEN A LOVELY NIGHT YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAY OF IT IN TOWN THEY'LL BE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU AT HOME DID YOU FIND THE MONEY ALL RIGHT AS YOU EXPECTED
2230-124587-0007 AND THEN FOR ABOUT THE TWENTIETH TIME WITHIN THE LAST FEW HOURS HE RECOUNTED THE PARTICULARS OF HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE BANK CLERK THE OLD MAN EXPRESSED HIS ENTIRE CONCURRENCE IN SAVAREEN'S ESTIMATE OF SHUTTLEWORTH'S CONDUCT
2230-124587-0008 I HAVE TO PAY THE GATE MONEY INTO THE BANK ON THE FIRST OF EVERY MONTH HE REMARKED AND THAT YOUNG FELLER ALWAYS ACTS AS IF HE FELT TOO UPPISH TO TOUCH IT I WONDER YOU DIDN'T DROP INTO UN O I WASN'T LIKELY TO DO THAT WAS THE REPLY BUT I GAVE HIM A BIT OF MY MIND
2230-124587-0009 AND SO IT WILL I'D SOONER KEEP MY BIT O MONEY WHEN I HAVE ANY IN THE CLOCK CASE AT HOME THERE'S NEVER ANY HOUSEBREAKING HEREABOUTS JONATHAN RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT IN SO FAR AS HE KNEW THERE HADN'T BEEN A BURGLARY FOR MANY A YEAR
2230-124587-0010 BUT ALL THE SAME HE CONTINUED I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO KEEP SUCH A SUM AS FOUR HUNDRED POUND ABOUT ME EVEN FOR A SINGLE NIGHT NO MORE I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO CARRY SUCH A POT O MONEY HOME IN THE NIGHT TIME EVEN IF NOBODY KNEW AS I HAD IT ON ME
2230-124587-0011 AND SO SAYING SAVAREEN CONTINUED HIS COURSE HOMEWARD AT A BRISK TROT THE OLD MAN WATCHED HIM AS HE SPED AWAY UP THE ROAD BUT COULD NOT KEEP HIM IN VIEW MORE THAN HALF A MINUTE OR SO AS BY THIS TIME THE LIGHT OF DAY HAD WHOLLY DEPARTED
2230-124587-0012 WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW I WONDER BUT THIS TIME HE WAS OUT IN HIS CONJECTURE WHEN THE HORSEMAN REACHED THE GATE HE PROVED TO BE NOT SAVAREEN BUT MINE HOST LAPIERRE MOUNTED ON HIS FAST TROTTING NAG COUNT FRONTENAC
2230-124587-0013 A NAME IRREVERENTLY ABBREVIATED BY THE SPORTSMEN OF THE DISTRICT INTO FRONTY THE RIDER DREW UP WITH A BOISTEROUS WOA AND REACHED OUT TOWARDS THE GATE KEEPER A FIVE CENT PIECE BY WAY OF TOLL SAYING AS HE DID SO
2230-124587-0014 VELL MISTER PERRY HOW COES EVERYTINGS WISS YOU O GOOD EVENING MISTER LAPIERRE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU TILL YOU SPOKE MY EYESIGHT'S GETTING DIMMER EVERY DAY I THINK BOUND FOR TOWN YES I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAS COT MISTER SAFAREEN
2230-124587-0015 MISSUS SAFAREEN COT SO UNEASY APOUT HIM TO NIGHT THAT SHE CAME UP TO MY PLACE AND PEGGED ME TO RIDE DOWN AND HUNT HIM UP I SUPPOSE YOU SAW HIM ON HIS WAY DOWN SAW HIM ON HIS WAY DOWN WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT DIDN'T YOU MEET HIM JUST NOW MEET WHO
2230-124587-0016 SAVAREEN WHERE WHEN
2230-124587-0017 HOW LONG PEFORE HOW LONG WHY DON'T I TELL YOU NOT TWO MINUTES
2230-124587-0018 THEN FOLLOWED FURTHER EXPLANATIONS ON THE PART OF OLD JONATHAN
2230-124587-0019 WELL OF COURSE THE KEY TO THE SITUATION WAS NOT HARD TO FIND SAVAREEN HAD LEFT THE TOLL GATE AND PROCEEDED NORTHWARD NOT MORE THAN TWO OR THREE MINUTES BEFORE LAPIERRE
2230-124587-0020 BUT THE SPACE OF TIME WHICH HAD ELAPSED WAS TOO BRIEF TO ADMIT OF THE LATTER'S HAVING RIDDEN MORE THAN A HUNDRED YARDS OR THEREABOUTS THE ONLY OUTLET FROM THE ROAD WITHIN FOUR TIMES THAT DISTANCE WAS THE GATEWAY LEADING INTO STOLLIVER'S HOUSE THE EXPLANATION CONSEQUENTLY WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH
2230-124587-0021 SAVAREEN HAD CALLED IN AT STOLLIVERS
2230-124587-0022 AND COME TO THINK OF IT IT WAS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT POSSIBLE REASON HE COULD HAVE FOR CALLING AT STOLLIVER'S HE HAD NEVER HAD ANY BUSINESS OR SOCIAL RELATIONS OF ANY KIND WITH STOLLIVER AND IN FACT THE TWO HAD MERELY A NODDING ACQUAINTANCE
2230-124587-0023 STILL ANOTHER STRANGE THING WAS THAT SAVAREEN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIS HORSE INSIDE THE GATE AS THERE WAS A TYING POST OUTSIDE AND HE COULD NOT HAVE INTENDED TO MAKE ANY PROLONGED STAY HOWEVER THERE WAS NO USE RAISING DIFFICULT PROBLEMS WHICH COULD DOUBT LESS BE SOLVED BY A MOMENT'S EXPLANATION
2230-124587-0024 IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT SAVAREEN WAS AT STOLLIVER'S BECAUSE HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE AVOIDED MEETING LAPIERRE IF HE HAD NOT CALLED THERE IT WAS LAPIERRE'S BUSINESS TO FIND HIM AND TAKE HIM HOME ACCORDINGLY THE LANDLORD OF THE ROYAL OAK TURNED HIS HORSE'S HEAD AND CANTERED BACK UP THE ROAD
2230-124587-0025 TILL HE REACHED THE FRONT OF STOLLIVER'S PLACE STOLLIVER AND HIS TWO BOYS WERE SITTING OUT ON THE FRONT FENCE HAVING EMERGED FROM THE HOUSE ONLY A MOMENT BEFORE
2230-124587-0026 OLD STOLLIVER WAS IN THE HABIT OF SMOKING A PIPE EVERY NIGHT AFTER HIS EVENING MEAL AND IN PLEASANT WEATHER HE GENERALLY CHOSE TO SMOKE IT OUT OF DOORS AS HE WAS DOING THIS EVENING ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS HAD FALLEN LAPIERRE AS HE DREW REIN
2230-124587-0027 LAPIERRE WAS ASTOUNDED
2230-124587-0028 WHO RECEIVED THE COMMUNICATION WITH HIS WONTED STOLIDITY AND PROCEEDED TO LIGHT HIS PIPE AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT THE AFFAIR WAS NONE OF HIS FUNERAL WELL HE REMARKED WITH EXASPERATING COOLNESS I GUESS YOU MUST A PASSED HIM ON THE ROAD
2230-124587-0029 OF COURSE IT WAS ALL NONSENSE ABOUT THE LANDLORD HAVING PASSED HIM ON THE ROAD WITHOUT SEEING OR HEARING ANYTHING OF HIM BUT WHAT OTHER EXPLANATION DID THE CIRCUMSTANCES ADMIT OF AT ANY RATE THERE WAS NOTHING FOR LAPIERRE TO DO BUT RIDE BACK TO SAVAREEN'S HOUSE AND SEE IF HE HAD ARRIVED THERE
2230-124587-0030 YES ONE OTHER THING MIGHT BE DONE HE MIGHT RETURN TO THE TOLL GATE AND ASCERTAIN WHETHER JONATHAN PERRY WAS CERTAIN AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE MAN FROM WHOM HE HAD PARTED A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SO COUNT FRONTENAC'S HEAD WAS ONCE MORE TURNED SOUTHWARD
2230-124587-0031 A SHORT TROT BROUGHT HIM AGAIN TO THE TOLL HOUSE THE GATEKEEPER WAS STILL SITTING SMOKING AT THE DOOR A MOMENT'S CONFERENCE WITH HIM WAS SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE LAPIERRE THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY
2230-124587-0032 WHY SAID JONATHAN I KNOW MISTER SAVAREEN AS WELL AS I KNOW MY RIGHT HAND AND THEN DIDN'T HE TELL ME ABOUT HIS ROW WITH SHUTTLEWORTH AND THAT HE HAD THE FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS IN HIS POCKET WHY DARK AS IT WAS I NOTICED THE SCAR ON HIS CHEEK WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT
2230-124587-0033 I SAY MISSUS LOOK HERE HE CALLED IN A LOUDER TONE WHEREUPON HIS WIFE PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE THRESHOLD NOW RESUMED THE OLD MAN JUST TELL MISTER LAPIERRE WHETHER YOU SAW MISTER SAVAREEN TALKING TO ME A FEW MINUTES SINCE AND WHETHER YOU SAW HIM RIDE OFF UP THE ROAD JUST BEFORE MISTER LAPIERRE CAME DOWN
2230-124587-0034 DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT MISSUS PERRY'S ANSWER WAS DECISIVE AND AT THE SAME TIME CONCLUSIVE AS TO THE FACTS SHE HAD NOT ONLY SEEN SAVAREEN SITTING ON HIS BLACK MARE AT THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TOWN BELL CEASED RINGING FOR EIGHT O'CLOCK
2230-124587-0035 BUT SHE HAD LISTENED TO THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HIM AND HER HUSBAND AND HAD HEARD PRETTY NEARLY EVERY WORD LAPIERRE CROSS EXAMINED HER AND FOUND THAT HER REPORT OF THE INTERVIEW EXACTLY CORRESPONDED WITH WHAT HE HAD ALREADY HEARD FROM OLD JONATHAN WHY SAID SHE
2230-124587-0036 THERE IS NO MORE DOUBT OF ITS BEING MISTER SAVAREEN THAN THERE IS OF THAT GATE POST BEING THERE ON THE ROAD SIDE VERY GOOD ADVICE IT IS SAYS HE AND I'LL ACT UPON IT WITHOUT MORE WORDS THEN HE SAID GOOD NIGHT AND OFF HE WENT UP THE ROAD
2230-124587-0037 LAPIERRE COULDN'T SEE IT HE KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT IT WAS NO MORE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PASS A MAN ON HORSEBACK ON THAT NARROW HIGHWAY ON A CLEAR NIGHT WITHOUT SEEING HIM MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS OUT FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF FINDING THAT VERY MAN
2230-124587-0038 HE STAYED NOT FOR BROOK THERE WAS A BROOK A SHORT DISTANCE UP THE ROAD AND HE STOPPED NOT FOR STONE BUT TORE ALONG AT A BREAK NECK PACE AS THOUGH HE WAS RIDING FOR A WAGER IN FIVE MINUTES HE REACHED SAVAREEN'S FRONT GATE
2230-124587-0039 MISSUS SAVAREEN WAS WAITING THERE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR HER HUSBAND NO OF COURSE HE HAD NOT GOT HOME SHE HAD NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD ANYTHING OF HIM AND WAS BY THIS TIME VERY UNEASY
2230-124587-0040 YOU MAY BE SURE THAT HER ANXIETY WAS NOT LESSENED WHEN SHE HEARD THE STRANGE TALE WHICH LAPIERRE HAD TO TELL HER EVEN THEN HOWEVER SHE DID NOT GIVE UP THE HOPE OF HER HUSBAND'S ARRIVAL SOMETIME DURING THE NIGHT LAPIERRE PROMISED TO LOOK IN AGAIN IN AN HOUR OR TWO
