92-204-0000 HALF A MINUTE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGH THE PUMP YARD TO THE ARCHWAY OPPOSITE UNION PASSAGE BUT HERE THEY WERE STOPPED EVERYBODY ACQUAINTED WITH BATH MAY REMEMBER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CROSSING CHEAP STREET AT THIS POINT
92-204-0001 IT IS INDEED A STREET OF SO IMPERTINENT A NATURE SO UNFORTUNATELY CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT LONDON AND OXFORD ROADS AND THE PRINCIPAL INN OF THE CITY THAT A DAY NEVER PASSES IN WHICH PARTIES OF LADIES HOWEVER IMPORTANT THEIR BUSINESS
92-204-0002 WHETHER IN QUEST OF PASTRY MILLINERY OR EVEN AS IN THE PRESENT CASE OF YOUNG MEN ARE NOT DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES HORSEMEN OR CARTS
92-204-0003 AND SHE WAS NOW FATED TO FEEL AND LAMENT IT ONCE MORE FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT OF COMING OPPOSITE TO UNION PASSAGE
92-204-0004 AND THREADING THE GUTTERS OF THAT INTERESTING ALLEY
92-204-0005 DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD PAVEMENT BY A MOST KNOWING LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF HIS COMPANION AND HIS HORSE OH THESE ODIOUS GIGS SAID ISABELLA LOOKING UP HOW I DETEST THEM
92-204-0006 BUT THIS DETESTATION THOUGH SO JUST WAS OF SHORT DURATION FOR SHE LOOKED AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED DELIGHTFUL MISTER MORLAND AND MY BROTHER GOOD HEAVEN TIS JAMES WAS UTTERED AT THE SAME MOMENT BY CATHERINE
92-204-0007 THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES
92-204-0008 CATHERINE BY WHOM THIS MEETING WAS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED RECEIVED HER BROTHER WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND HE BEING OF A VERY AMIABLE DISPOSITION AND SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HER GAVE EVERY PROOF ON HIS SIDE OF EQUAL SATISFACTION
92-204-0009 WHICH HE COULD HAVE LEISURE TO DO WHILE THE BRIGHT EYES OF MISS THORPE WERE INCESSANTLY CHALLENGING HIS NOTICE AND TO HER HIS DEVOIRS WERE SPEEDILY PAID WITH A MIXTURE OF JOY AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH MIGHT HAVE INFORMED CATHERINE
92-204-0010 AND LESS SIMPLY ENGROSSED BY HER OWN THAT HER BROTHER THOUGHT HER FRIEND QUITE AS PRETTY AS SHE COULD DO HERSELF JOHN THORPE WHO IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN GIVING ORDERS ABOUT THE HORSES SOON JOINED THEM AND FROM HIM SHE DIRECTLY RECEIVED THE AMENDS WHICH WERE HER DUE
92-204-0011 FOR WHILE HE SLIGHTLY AND CARELESSLY TOUCHED THE HAND OF ISABELLA ON HER HE BESTOWED A WHOLE SCRAPE AND HALF A SHORT BOW HE WAS A STOUT YOUNG MAN OF MIDDLING HEIGHT WHO WITH A PLAIN FACE AND UNGRACEFUL FORM
92-204-0012 AND TOO MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN UNLESS HE WERE EASY WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE CIVIL AND IMPUDENT WHERE HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE EASY HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IT FROM TETBURY MISS MORLAND I DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE
92-204-0013 HER BROTHER TOLD HER THAT IT WAS TWENTY THREE MILES THREE AND TWENTY CRIED THORPE FIVE AND TWENTY IF IT IS AN INCH MORLAND REMONSTRATED PLEADED THE AUTHORITY OF ROAD BOOKS INNKEEPERS AND MILESTONES
92-204-0014 BUT HIS FRIEND DISREGARDED THEM ALL HE HAD A SURER TEST OF DISTANCE I KNOW IT MUST BE FIVE AND TWENTY SAID HE BY THE TIME WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT IT IS NOW HALF AFTER ONE WE DROVE OUT OF THE INN YARD AT TETBURY AS THE TOWN CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN
92-204-0015 AND I DEFY ANY MAN IN ENGLAND TO MAKE MY HORSE GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR IN HARNESS THAT MAKES IT EXACTLY TWENTY FIVE YOU HAVE LOST AN HOUR SAID MORLAND IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE CAME FROM TETBURY TEN O'CLOCK
92-204-0016 IT WAS ELEVEN UPON MY SOUL I COUNTED EVERY STROKE THIS BROTHER OF YOURS WOULD PERSUADE ME OUT OF MY SENSES MISS MORLAND DO BUT LOOK AT MY HORSE
92-204-0017 THE SERVANT HAD JUST MOUNTED THE CARRIAGE AND WAS DRIVING OFF SUCH TRUE BLOOD
92-204-0018 LOOK AT THAT CREATURE AND SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE IF YOU CAN HE DOES LOOK VERY HOT TO BE SURE HOT HE HAD NOT TURNED A HAIR TILL WE CAME TO WALCOT CHURCH
92-204-0019 LOOK AT HIS LOINS ONLY SEE HOW HE MOVES THAT HORSE CANNOT GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR TIE HIS LEGS AND HE WILL GET ON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY GIG MISS MORLAND
92-204-0020 HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT
92-204-0021 BUT I CHANCED TO MEET HIM ON MAGDALEN BRIDGE AS HE WAS DRIVING INTO OXFORD LAST TERM AH THORPE SAID HE DO YOU HAPPEN TO WANT SUCH A LITTLE THING AS THIS IT IS A CAPITAL ONE OF THE KIND BUT I AM CURSED TIRED OF IT
92-204-0022 AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE DID MISS MORLAND I AM SURE I CANNOT GUESS AT ALL CURRICLE HUNG YOU SEE SEAT TRUNK SWORD CASE SPLASHING BOARD LAMPS SILVER MOULDING ALL YOU SEE COMPLETE THE IRON WORK AS GOOD AS NEW OR BETTER
92-204-0023 HE ASKED FIFTY GUINEAS I CLOSED WITH HIM DIRECTLY THREW DOWN THE MONEY AND THE CARRIAGE WAS MINE AND I AM SURE SAID CATHERINE
92-204-0024 AND ON FINDING WHITHER THEY WERE GOING IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE GENTLEMEN SHOULD ACCOMPANY THEM TO EDGAR'S BUILDINGS AND PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO MISSUS THORPE JAMES AND ISABELLA LED THE WAY AND SO WELL SATISFIED WAS THE LATTER WITH HER LOT
92-204-0025 SO CONTENTEDLY WAS SHE ENDEAVOURING TO ENSURE A PLEASANT WALK TO HIM WHO BROUGHT THE DOUBLE RECOMMENDATION OF BEING HER BROTHER'S FRIEND AND HER FRIEND'S BROTHER SO PURE AND UNCOQUETTISH WERE HER FEELINGS THAT
92-204-0026 THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS SO FAR FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY THREE TIMES JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE
92-204-0027 RENEWED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HIS GIG YOU WILL FIND HOWEVER MISS MORLAND IT WOULD BE RECKONED A CHEAP THING BY SOME PEOPLE FOR I MIGHT HAVE SOLD IT FOR TEN GUINEAS MORE THE NEXT DAY JACKSON OF ORIEL BID ME SIXTY AT ONCE MORLAND WAS WITH ME AT THE TIME
92-204-0028 YES SAID MORLAND WHO OVERHEARD THIS BUT YOU FORGET THAT YOUR HORSE WAS INCLUDED MY HORSE
92-204-0029 I WOULD NOT SELL MY HORSE FOR A HUNDRED ARE YOU FOND OF AN OPEN CARRIAGE MISS MORLAND YES VERY I HAVE HARDLY EVER AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING IN ONE BUT I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF IT I AM GLAD OF IT I WILL DRIVE YOU OUT IN MINE EVERY DAY
92-204-0030 THANK YOU SAID CATHERINE
92-204-0031 I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN HILL TOMORROW THANK YOU BUT WILL NOT YOUR HORSE WANT REST REST HE HAS ONLY COME THREE AND TWENTY MILES TODAY ALL NONSENSE NOTHING RUINS HORSES SO MUCH AS REST NOTHING KNOCKS THEM UP SO SOON
92-204-0032 NO NO I SHALL EXERCISE MINE AT THE AVERAGE OF FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY WHILE I AM HERE SHALL YOU INDEED SAID CATHERINE VERY SERIOUSLY
92-204-0033 FORTY AYE FIFTY FOR WHAT I CARE WELL I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN TOMORROW MIND I AM ENGAGED HOW DELIGHTFUL THAT WILL BE CRIED ISABELLA TURNING ROUND MY DEAREST CATHERINE I QUITE ENVY YOU
92-204-0034 A THIRD INDEED NO NO I DID NOT COME TO BATH TO DRIVE MY SISTERS ABOUT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD JOKE FAITH MORLAND MUST TAKE CARE OF YOU THIS BROUGHT ON A DIALOGUE OF CIVILITIES BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO
92-204-0035 BUT CATHERINE HEARD NEITHER THE PARTICULARS NOR THE RESULT HER COMPANION'S DISCOURSE NOW SUNK FROM ITS HITHERTO ANIMATED PITCH TO NOTHING MORE THAN A SHORT DECISIVE SENTENCE OF PRAISE OR CONDEMNATION ON THE FACE OF EVERY WOMAN THEY MET AND CATHERINE
92-204-0036 AFTER LISTENING AND AGREEING AS LONG AS SHE COULD WITH ALL THE CIVILITY AND DEFERENCE OF THE YOUTHFUL FEMALE MIND FEARFUL OF HAZARDING AN OPINION OF ITS OWN IN OPPOSITION TO THAT OF A SELF ASSURED MAN ESPECIALLY WHERE THE BEAUTY OF HER OWN SEX IS CONCERNED
92-204-0037 IT WAS HAVE YOU EVER READ UDOLPHO MISTER THORPE UDOLPHO OH LORD NOT I I NEVER READ NOVELS I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO CATHERINE HUMBLED AND ASHAMED
92-204-0038 THERE HAS NOT BEEN A TOLERABLY DECENT ONE COME OUT SINCE TOM JONES EXCEPT THE MONK I READ THAT T'OTHER DAY BUT AS FOR ALL THE OTHERS THEY ARE THE STUPIDEST THINGS IN CREATION I THINK YOU MUST LIKE UDOLPHO IF YOU WERE TO READ IT IT IS SO VERY INTERESTING
92-204-0039 NOT I FAITH NO IF I READ ANY IT SHALL BE MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S HER NOVELS ARE AMUSING ENOUGH THEY ARE WORTH READING SOME FUN AND NATURE IN THEM UDOLPHO WAS WRITTEN BY MISSUS RADCLIFFE SAID CATHERINE
92-204-0040 WITH SOME HESITATION FROM THE FEAR OF MORTIFYING HIM NO SURE WAS IT AYE I REMEMBER SO IT WAS I WAS THINKING OF THAT OTHER STUPID BOOK WRITTEN BY THAT WOMAN THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SHE WHO MARRIED THE FRENCH EMIGRANT
92-204-0041 I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN CAMILLA YES
92-204-0042 I TOOK UP THE FIRST VOLUME ONCE AND LOOKED IT OVER BUT I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO INDEED I GUESSED WHAT SORT OF STUFF IT MUST BE BEFORE I SAW IT
92-204-0043 I HAVE NEVER READ IT YOU HAD NO LOSS I ASSURE YOU IT IS THE HORRIDEST NONSENSE YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD IN IT BUT AN OLD MAN'S PLAYING AT SEE SAW AND LEARNING LATIN UPON MY SOUL THERE IS NOT
92-204-0044 THIS CRITIQUE THE JUSTNESS OF WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON POOR CATHERINE BROUGHT THEM TO THE DOOR OF MISSUS THORPE'S LODGINGS AND THE FEELINGS OF THE DISCERNING AND UNPREJUDICED READER OF CAMILLA GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS OF THE DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE SON
92-204-0045 AS THEY MET MISSUS THORPE WHO HAD DESCRIED THEM FROM ABOVE IN THE PASSAGE AH MOTHER HOW DO YOU DO SAID HE GIVING HER A HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND WHERE DID YOU GET THAT QUIZ OF A HAT IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE AN OLD WITCH
92-204-0046 AND THIS ADDRESS
92-204-0047 FOR SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE MOST DELIGHTED AND EXULTING AFFECTION ON HIS TWO YOUNGER SISTERS HE THEN BESTOWED AN EQUAL PORTION OF HIS FRATERNAL TENDERNESS FOR HE ASKED EACH OF THEM HOW THEY DID
92-204-0048 THESE MANNERS DID NOT PLEASE CATHERINE BUT HE WAS JAMES'S FRIEND AND ISABELLA'S BROTHER AND HER JUDGMENT WAS FURTHER BOUGHT OFF BY ISABELLA'S ASSURING HER WHEN THEY WITHDREW TO SEE THE NEW HAT THAT JOHN THOUGHT HER THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD
92-204-0049 AND BY JOHN'S ENGAGING HER BEFORE THEY PARTED TO DANCE WITH HIM THAT EVENING HAD SHE BEEN OLDER OR VAINER SUCH ATTACKS MIGHT HAVE DONE LITTLE
92-204-0050 IT REQUIRES UNCOMMON STEADINESS OF REASON TO RESIST THE ATTRACTION OF BEING CALLED THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD
92-204-0051 AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
92-204-0052 SET OFF TO WALK TOGETHER TO MISTER ALLEN'S AND JAMES AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON THEM SAID WELL CATHERINE HOW DO YOU LIKE MY FRIEND THORPE INSTEAD OF ANSWERING AS SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE HAD THERE BEEN NO FRIENDSHIP AND NO FLATTERY IN THE CASE I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL
92-204-0053 SHE DIRECTLY REPLIED I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH HE SEEMS VERY AGREEABLE HE IS AS GOOD NATURED A FELLOW AS EVER LIVED A LITTLE OF A RATTLE BUT THAT WILL RECOMMEND HIM TO YOUR SEX I BELIEVE AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THE REST OF THE FAMILY
92-204-0054 VERY VERY MUCH INDEED ISABELLA PARTICULARLY
92-204-0055 SHE IS JUST THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMAN I COULD WISH TO SEE YOU ATTACHED TO SHE HAS SO MUCH GOOD SENSE AND IS SO THOROUGHLY UNAFFECTED AND AMIABLE I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO KNOW HER AND SHE SEEMS VERY FOND OF YOU SHE SAID THE HIGHEST THINGS IN YOUR PRAISE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
92-204-0056 AND THE PRAISE OF SUCH A GIRL AS MISS THORPE EVEN YOU CATHERINE
92-204-0057 MAY BE PROUD OF INDEED I AM SHE REPLIED I LOVE HER EXCEEDINGLY AND AM DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT YOU LIKE HER TOO YOU HARDLY MENTIONED ANYTHING OF HER WHEN YOU WROTE TO ME AFTER YOUR VISIT THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SHOULD SOON SEE YOU MYSELF
92-204-0058 I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL TOGETHER WHILE YOU ARE IN BATH SHE IS A MOST AMIABLE GIRL SUCH A SUPERIOR UNDERSTANDING HOW FOND ALL THE FAMILY ARE OF HER SHE IS EVIDENTLY THE GENERAL FAVOURITE
92-204-0059 IS NOT SHE YES VERY MUCH INDEED I FANCY MISTER ALLEN THINKS HER THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN BATH I DARE SAY HE DOES AND I DO NOT KNOW ANY MAN WHO IS A BETTER JUDGE OF BEAUTY THAN MISTER ALLEN
92-204-0060 I NEED NOT ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE HAPPY HERE MY DEAR CATHERINE WITH SUCH A COMPANION AND FRIEND AS ISABELLA THORPE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BE OTHERWISE
92-204-0061 YES VERY KIND I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY BEFORE
92-204-0062 JAMES ACCEPTED THIS TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE AND QUALIFIED HIS CONSCIENCE FOR ACCEPTING IT TOO BY SAYING WITH PERFECT SINCERITY INDEED CATHERINE I LOVE YOU DEARLY
92-204-0063 THE SITUATION OF SOME THE GROWTH OF THE REST AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS NOW PASSED BETWEEN THEM AND CONTINUED WITH ONLY ONE SMALL DIGRESSION ON JAMES'S PART IN PRAISE OF MISS THORPE TILL THEY REACHED PULTENEY STREET
92-204-0064 WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED WITH GREAT KINDNESS BY MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN INVITED BY THE FORMER TO DINE WITH THEM AND SUMMONED BY THE LATTER TO GUESS THE PRICE AND WEIGH THE MERITS OF A NEW MUFF AND TIPPET A PRE ENGAGEMENT IN EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
92-204-0065 PREVENTED HIS ACCEPTING THE INVITATION OF ONE FRIEND AND OBLIGED HIM TO HURRY AWAY AS SOON AS HE HAD SATISFIED THE DEMANDS OF THE OTHER
92-204-0066 BEING CORRECTLY ADJUSTED CATHERINE WAS THEN LEFT TO THE LUXURY OF A RAISED RESTLESS AND FRIGHTENED IMAGINATION OVER THE PAGES OF UDOLPHO
