1704-142310-0001 THE SOBS OF THE MOURNERS DEEP AND LOW SHELLEY AT THE TIME ARRANGED THE PREVIOUS DAY THEY SET OUT ON THEIR WALK TO SEE NICHOLAS HIGGINS AND HIS DAUGHTER
1704-142310-0002 BY A STRANGE KIND OF SHYNESS IN THEIR NEW HABILIMENTS AND IN THE FACT THAT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY WEEKS THAT THEY HAD DELIBERATELY GONE OUT TOGETHER THEY DREW VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER IN UNSPOKEN SYMPATHY
1704-142310-0003 NICHOLAS WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE SIDE IN HIS ACCUSTOMED CORNER BUT HE HAD NOT HIS ACCUSTOMED PIPE HE WAS LEANING HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND HIS ARM RESTING ON HIS KNEE HE DID NOT GET UP WHEN HE SAW THEM
1704-142310-0004 THOUGH MARGARET COULD READ THE WELCOME IN HIS EYE SIT YE DOWN SIT YE DOWN FIRE'S WELLY OUT SAID HE GIVING IT A VIGOROUS POKE AS IF TO TURN ATTENTION AWAY FROM HIMSELF HE WAS RATHER DISORDERLY TO BE SURE
1704-142310-0005 WITH A BLACK UNSHAVEN BEARD OF SEVERAL DAYS GROWTH MAKING HIS PALE FACE LOOK YET PALER AND A JACKET WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THE BETTER FOR PATCHING WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF FINDING YOU JUST AFTER DINNER TIME

1704-142310-0011 AND BAD WORDS IS PLENTIFUL HE WAS IN A MOOD TO TAKE A SURLY PLEASURE IN GIVING ANSWERS THAT WERE LIKE RIDDLES BUT MARGARET SAW THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BE ASKED FOR THE EXPLANATION AND GOOD WORDS ARE ASKING FOR WORK

1704-142310-0015 I COULD MAPPEN HA LEARNT IF ANY ONE HAD TRIED TO TEACH ME WOULD IT NOT BE WORTH WHILE SAID MISTER HALE TO ASK YOUR OLD MASTER IF HE WOULD TAKE YOU BACK AGAIN IT MIGHT BE A POOR CHANCE BUT IT WOULD BE A CHANCE
1704-142310-0016 HE LOOKED UP AGAIN WITH A SHARP GLANCE AT THE QUESTIONER AND THEN TITTERED A LOW AND BITTER LAUGH
1704-142310-0017 IF IT'S NO OFFENCE I'LL ASK YO A QUESTION OR TWO IN MY TURN YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME SAID MISTER HALE I RECKON YO'N SOME WAY OF EARNING YOUR BREAD
1704-142310-0018 YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT I HAVE SOME INDEPENDENT PROPERTY BUT MY INTENTION IN SETTLING IN MILTON WAS TO BECOME A PRIVATE TUTOR TO TEACH FOLK

1704-142310-0023 IT WOULD BE SOME VERY HARD PRESSURE THAT WOULD MAKE ME EVEN THINK OF SUBMITTING TO SUCH DICTATION THERE'S NOT THE PRESSURE ON ALL THE BROAD EARTH THAT WOULD MAKE ME SAID NICHOLAS HIGGINS NOW YO'VE GOT IT
1704-142310-0024 HAMPER'S THAT'S WHERE I WORKED
1704-142310-0025 OR HELP ON THE RIGHT AND JUST CAUSE THOUGH IT GOES AGAIN THE STRONG HAND
1704-142310-0026 I'M A MEMBER O THE UNION AND I THINK IT'S THE ONLY THING TO DO THE WORKMAN ANY GOOD AND I'VE BEEN A TURN OUT AND KNOWN WHAT IT WERE TO CLEM SO IF I GET A SHILLING SIXPENCE SHALL GO TO THEM IF THEY AXE IT FROM ME
1704-142310-0027 CONSEQUENCE IS I DUNNOT SEE WHERE I'M TO GET A SHILLING IS THAT RULE ABOUT NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE UNION IN FORCE AT ALL THE MILLS ASKED MARGARET
1704-142310-0028 AND I RECKON THEY'LL FIND THAT THEY CANNOT STICK TO IT BUT IT'S IN FORCE NOW BY AND BY THEY'LL FIND OUT TYRANTS MAKES LIARS THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE MARGARET WAS HESITATING WHETHER SHE SHOULD SAY WHAT WAS IN HER MIND
1704-142310-0029 SHE WAS UNWILLING TO IRRITATE ONE WHO WAS ALREADY GLOOMY AND DESPONDENT ENOUGH AT LAST OUT IT CAME BUT IN HER SOFT TONES AND WITH HER RELUCTANT MANNER SHOWING THAT SHE WAS UNWILLING TO SAY ANYTHING UNPLEASANT
1704-142310-0030 IT DID NOT SEEM TO ANNOY HIGGINS ONLY TO PERPLEX HIM DO YOU REMEMBER POOR BOUCHER SAYING THAT THE UNION WAS A TYRANT I THINK HE SAID IT WAS THE WORST TYRANT OF ALL
1704-142310-0031 AND I REMEMBER AT THE TIME I AGREED WITH HIM IT WAS A LONG WHILE BEFORE HE SPOKE HE WAS RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS TWO HANDS AND LOOKING DOWN INTO THE FIRE SO SHE COULD NOT READ THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE
1704-142310-0032 I'LL SPEAK TRUTH
1704-142310-0033 IT'S THE ONLY WAY WORKING MEN CAN GET THEIR RIGHTS BY ALL JOINING TOGETHER MORE THE MEMBERS MORE CHANCE FOR EACH ONE SEPARATE MAN HAVING JUSTICE DONE HIM GOVERNMENT TAKES CARE O FOOLS AND MADMEN
1704-142310-0034 WE CAN'T CLAP FOLK INTO PRISON
1704-142310-0035 THAT HE'S OBLIGED TO COME IN AND BE WISE AND HELPFUL IN SPITE OF HIMSELF BOUCHER WERE A FOOL ALL ALONG
1704-142310-0036 HE DID YOU HARM ASKED MARGARET
1704-142310-0037 THEN WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER TO HAVE LEFT HIM ALONE AND NOT FORCED HIM TO JOIN THE UNION HE DID YOU NO GOOD AND YOU DROVE HIM MAD MARGARET SAID HER FATHER IN A LOW AND WARNING TONE
1704-142310-0038 FOR HE SAW THE CLOUD GATHERING ON HIGGINS'S FACE I LIKE HER SAID HIGGINS SUDDENLY HOO SPEAKS PLAIN OUT WHAT'S IN HER MIND
1704-142310-0039 IT'S A GREAT POWER IT'S OUR ONLY POWER

1704-142310-0047 NOW FORCING ITSELF ON THEIR ATTENTION MANY VOICES WERE HUSHED AND LOW MANY STEPS WERE HEARD NOT MOVING ONWARDS AT LEAST NOT WITH ANY RAPIDITY OR STEADINESS OF MOTION BUT AS IF CIRCLING ROUND ONE SPOT
1704-142310-0048 YES THERE WAS ONE DISTINCT SLOW TRAMP OF FEET WHICH MADE ITSELF A CLEAR PATH THROUGH THE AIR AND REACHED THEIR EARS THE MEASURED LABOURED WALK OF MEN CARRYING A HEAVY BURDEN
1704-142310-0049 THEY WERE ALL DRAWN TOWARDS THE HOUSE DOOR BY SOME IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE IMPELLED THITHER NOT BY A POOR CURIOSITY BUT AS IF BY SOME SOLEMN BLAST SIX MEN WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
1704-142310-0050 THREE OF THEM BEING POLICEMEN THEY CARRIED A DOOR TAKEN OFF ITS HINGES UPON THEIR SHOULDERS ON WHICH LAY SOME DEAD HUMAN CREATURE AND FROM EACH SIDE OF THE DOOR THERE WERE CONSTANT DROPPINGS
1704-142310-0051 ALL THE STREET TURNED OUT TO SEE AND SEEING TO ACCOMPANY THE PROCESSION EACH ONE QUESTIONING THE BEARERS WHO ANSWERED ALMOST RELUCTANTLY AT LAST SO OFTEN HAD THEY TOLD THE TALE

1704-142310-0056 AND EVERY SEPARATE LOCK WAS A CONDUIT FOR WATER THROUGH ALL THESE DISFIGUREMENTS MARGARET RECOGNISED JOHN BOUCHER IT SEEMED TO HER SO SACRILEGIOUS TO BE PEERING INTO THAT POOR
1704-142310-0057 DISTORTED AGONISED FACE THAT BY A FLASH OF INSTINCT SHE WENT FORWARDS AND SOFTLY COVERED THE DEAD MAN'S COUNTENANCE WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF
