2853-164187-0000 THE PATTERN WAS OF LITTLE BUNCHES OF PINK ROSES PEEPING OUT THROUGH TRELLIS WORK AND IT WAS THESE WHICH SHE HAD JUST BEGUN TO CUT OUT THOUGH TILLING WAS NOTED FOR THE INGENUITY WITH WHICH ITS MORE FASHIONABLE LADIES DEVISED NOVEL AND QUAINT EFFECTS IN THE DRESS IN AN ECONOMICAL MANNER
2853-164187-0001 THE HOT WEATHER HAD CONTINUED LATE INTO SEPTEMBER AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF BREAKING YET AND IT WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO HER AND ACUTELY PAINFUL TO OTHERS THAT JUST AT THE END OF THE SUMMER SHE SHOULD APPEAR IN A PERFECTLY NEW COSTUME
2853-164187-0002 BEFORE THE DAYS OF JUMPERS AND HEAVY SKIRTS AND LARGE WOOLLEN SCARVES CAME IN SHE WAS PREPARING THEREFORE TO TAKE THE LIGHT WHITE JACKET WHICH SHE WORE OVER HER BLOUSE AND COVER THE BROAD COLLAR AND CUFFS OF IT WITH THESE PRETTY ROSES
2853-164187-0003 THE BELT OF THE SKIRT WOULD BE SIMILARLY DECORATED AND SO WOULD THE EDGE OF IT IF THERE WERE ENOUGH CLEAN ONES
2853-164187-0004 BUT OF A RICH PURPLE HUE AND BY THAT TIME SHE WOULD HAVE HUNDREDS OF THESE LITTLE PINK ROSES READY TO BE TACKED ON PERHAPS A PIECE OF THE CHINTZ TRELLIS AND ALL COULD BE SEWN OVER THE BELT
2853-164187-0005 OF THE JACKET AND IF POSSIBLE ROUND THE EDGE OF THE SKIRT
2853-164187-0006 WHEN CAREFULLY SEWN ON THEY LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE A DESIGN IN THE STUFF SHE LET THE CIRCUMCISED ROSES FALL ON TO THE WINDOW SEAT AND FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN THEY GREW NUMEROUS SWEPT THEM INTO A CARDBOARD BOX
2853-164187-0007 THOUGH SHE WORKED WITH ZEALOUS DILIGENCE SHE HAD AN EYE TO THE MOVEMENTS IN THE STREET OUTSIDE FOR IT WAS SHOPPING HOUR AND THERE WERE MANY OBSERVATIONS TO BE MADE SHE HAD NOT ANYTHING LIKE MISS MAPP'S GENIUS FOR CONJECTURE BUT HER MEMORY WAS APPALLINGLY GOOD
2853-164187-0008 IT WAS ODD TO GO TO YOUR GROCER'S EVERY DAY LIKE THAT GROCERIES TWICE A WEEK WAS SUFFICIENT FOR MOST PEOPLE FROM HERE ON THE FLOOR ABOVE THE STREET SHE COULD EASILY LOOK INTO ELIZABETH'S BASKET AND SHE CERTAINLY WAS CARRYING NOTHING AWAY WITH HER FROM THE GROCER'S
2853-164187-0009 CERTAINLY CAME FROM THE CHEMIST'S AND WAS NO DOUBT CONNECTED WITH TOO MANY PLUMS
2853-164187-0010 OR RATHER NOT BRINGING IN THE SECOND POST BUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THERE WASN'T ANY SECOND POST THIS OPENING OF THE DOOR CAUSED A DRAUGHT AND THE BUNCHES OF ROSES WHICH LITTERED THE WINDOW SEAT ROSE BRIGHTLY IN THE AIR
2853-164187-0011 PRECISELY THEN AND AT NO OTHER TIME MISS MAPP LOOKED UP AND ONE SETTLED ON HER FACE THE OTHER FELL INTO HER BASKET HER TRAINED FACULTIES WERE ALL ON THE ALERT AND SHE THRUST THEM BOTH INSIDE HER GLOVE FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION
2853-164187-0012 WITHOUT STOPPING TO EXAMINE THEM JUST THEN SHE ONLY KNEW THAT THEY WERE LITTLE PINK ROSES
2853-164187-0013 AND THAT SHE STILL POPPED AS MUCH AS EVER
2853-164187-0014 POP IN CRUDE INVERTED COMMAS SO TO SPEAK FOR PURPOSES OF MOCKERY AND SO SHE SAID IT HERSELF MORE THAN EVER I'LL TELL MY MAID TO POP DOWN AND OPEN THE DOOR
2853-164187-0015 FOR SECRECY WAS AN ESSENTIAL TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE DECORATIONS BUT IN ORDER TO APPEAR NATURALLY EMPLOYED SHE PULLED OUT THE WOOLLEN SCARF SHE WAS KNITTING FOR THE AUTUMN AND WINTER
2853-164187-0016 FORGETTING FOR THE MOMENT THAT THE ROSE MADDER STRIPE AT THE END ON WHICH SHE WAS NOW ENGAGED WAS MADE OF THAT FATAL WORSTED WHICH MISS MAPP CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN FELONIOUSLY APPROPRIATED
2853-164187-0017 THAT WAS THE SORT OF THING MISS MAPP NEVER FORGOT EVEN AMONG HER SWEET FLOWERS HER EYE FELL ON IT THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED THE ROOM AND SHE TUCKED THE TWO CHINTZ ROSES MORE SECURELY INTO HER GLOVE
2853-164187-0018 I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST POP ACROSS FROM THE GROCER'S SHE SAID WHAT A PRETTY SCARF DEAR THAT'S A LOVELY SHADE OF ROSE MADDER WHERE CAN I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE IT BEFORE THIS WAS CLEARLY IRONICAL AND HAD BEST BE ANSWERED BY IRONY
2853-164187-0019 COULDN'T SAY I'M SURE SHE SAID MISS MAPP APPEARED TO RECOLLECT AND SMILED AS FAR BACK AS HER WISDOM TEETH
2853-164187-0020 I HAVE IT SHE SAID IT WAS THE WOOL I ORDERED AT HEYNES'S AND THEN HE SOLD IT YOU AND I COULDN'T GET ANY MORE
2853-164187-0021 UPSET YOU A BIT THERE WAS THE WOOL IN THE SHOP I BOUGHT IT YES DEAR I SEE YOU DID BUT THAT WASN'T WHAT I POPPED IN ABOUT THIS COAL STRIKE YOU KNOW
2853-164187-0022 THEY CAN TAKE AWAY EVERY ATOM OF COAL YOU'VE GOT IF SO AND FINE YOU
2853-164187-0023 RATHER FORCING THE INDIFFERENCE OF THIS RUDE INTERJECTION YES LOVE POOH BY ALL MEANS IF YOU LIKE POOHING SAID MISS MAPP BUT I SHOULD HAVE FELT VERY UNFRIENDLY IF ONE MORNING I FOUND YOU WERE FINED FOUND YOU WERE FINED
2853-164187-0024 BUT HOW MUCH DO THEY ALLOW YOU TO HAVE SHE ASKED OH QUITE A LITTLE ENOUGH TO GO ON WITH BUT I DARESAY THEY WON'T DISCOVER YOU I JUST TOOK THE TROUBLE TO COME AND WARN YOU
2853-164187-0025 THERE HAD SURELY BEEN DREADFUL EXPOSURES OF PRUDENT HOUSEKEEPERS IN THE PAPERS WHICH WERE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE READING
2853-164187-0026 TELLS ME THAT HE THINKS WE SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF FOOD OR ANYHOW SUFFICIENT FOR EVERYBODY FOR QUITE A LONG TIME PROVIDED THAT THERE'S NO HOARDING NOT BEEN HOARDING FOOD TOO
2853-164187-0027 YOU SHALL SEE FOR YOURSELF AND THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT THE CUPBOARD WAS FULL OF CHINTZ CURTAINS AND LITTLE BUNCHES OF PINK ROSES NEATLY CUT OUT OF THEM AND A PAIR OF NAIL SCISSORS
2853-164187-0028 THERE WAS A PERFECTLY PERCEPTIBLE PAUSE DURING WHICH MISS MAPP NOTICED THAT THERE WERE NO CURTAINS OVER THE WINDOW THERE CERTAINLY USED TO BE AND THEY MATCHED WITH THE CHINTZ COVER OF THE WINDOW SEAT
2853-164187-0029 WHICH WAS DECORATED WITH LITTLE BUNCHES OF PINK ROSES PEEPING THROUGH TRELLIS THIS WAS IN THE NATURE OF A BONUS SHE HAD NOT UP TILL THEN CONNECTED THE CHINTZ CURTAINS WITH THE LITTLE THINGS THAT HAD FLUTTERED DOWN UPON HER AND WERE NOW SAFE IN HER GLOVE
2853-164187-0030 THAT SHE HUMBLY HOPED THAT SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED SHE GOT UP MUST BE GOING SHE SAID
2853-164187-0031 GONE TO THE WASH SAID DIVA FIRMLY LIAR THOUGHT MISS MAPP AS SHE TRIPPED DOWNSTAIRS
2853-164187-0032 WHO WAS LOOKING GLOOMILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SOON AS MISS MAPP HAD GAINED HER GARDEN ROOM SHE EXAMINED THE MYSTERIOUS TREASURES IN HER LEFT HAND GLOVE
2853-164187-0033 AND HIGH TIME TOO FOR THEY WERE SADLY SHABBY AND WAS CUTTING THE ROSES OUT OF THEM BUT WHAT ON EARTH WAS SHE DOING THAT FOR FOR WHAT GARISH PURPOSE COULD SHE WANT TO USE BUNCHES OF ROSES CUT OUT OF CHINTZ CURTAINS
2853-164187-0034 MISS MAPP HAD PUT THE TWO SPECIMENS OF WHICH SHE HAD SO PROVIDENTIALLY BECOME POSSESSED IN HER LAP AND THEY LOOKED VERY PRETTY AGAINST THE NAVY BLUE OF HER SKIRT
2853-164187-0035 AND MOST OF HER INGENUITY WAS DEVOTED TO DRESS
2853-164187-0036 EUREKA SAID MISS MAPP ALOUD AND THOUGH THE TELEPHONE BELL WAS RINGING AND THE POSTULANT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE SERVANTS FRIENDS RINGING THEM UP AT AN HOUR WHEN THEIR MISTRESS WAS USUALLY IN THE HIGH STREET
2853-164187-0037 COULD BEAR TO THROW AWAY BROKEN BASKET CHAIRS PIECES OF BROWN PAPER CARDBOARD BOXES WITHOUT LIDS AND CARDBOARD LIDS WITHOUT BOXES OLD BAGS WITH HOLES IN THEM KEYS WITHOUT LOCKS AND LOCKS WITHOUT KEYS AND WORN CHINTZ COVERS
2853-164187-0038 THERE WAS ONE IT HAD ONCE ADORNED THE SOFA IN THE GARDEN ROOM COVERED WITH RED POPPIES VERY EASY TO CUT OUT AND MISS MAPP DRAGGED IT DUSTILY FROM ITS CORNER SETTING IN MOTION A PERFECT CASCADE OF CARDBOARD LIDS AND SOME DOOR HANDLES
2853-164187-0039 WITHERS HAD ANSWERED THE TELEPHONE AND CAME TO ANNOUNCE THAT TWEMLOW THE GROCER REGRETTED HE HAD ONLY TWO LARGE TINS OF CORNED BEEF BUT THEN SAY I WILL HAVE THE TONGUE AS WELL WITHERS SAID MISS MAPP JUST A TONGUE AND THEN I SHALL WANT YOU AND MARY TO DO SOME CUTTING OUT FOR ME
2853-164187-0040 AND BY FOUR O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON THERE WERE ENOUGH POPPIES CUT OUT TO FURNISH WHEN IN SEED A WHOLE STREET OF OPIUM DENS THE DRESS SELECTED FOR DECORATION WAS APART FROM A FEW MILDEW SPOTS
2853-164187-0041 NO ONE CAN WORK AS NEATLY AS YOU WITHERS SHE SAID GAILY AND I SHALL ASK YOU TO DO THE MOST DIFFICULT PART I WANT YOU TO SEW MY LOVELY POPPIES OVER THE COLLAR AND FACINGS OF THE JACKET JUST SPACING THEM A LITTLE AND MAKING A DAINTY IRREGULARITY
2853-164187-0042 WILL DO THE SAME WITH THE WAISTBAND WHILE I PUT A BORDER OF THEM ROUND THE SKIRT AND MY DEAR OLD DRESS WILL LOOK QUITE NEW AND LOVELY I SHALL BE AT HOME TO NOBODY WITHERS THIS AFTERNOON EVEN IF THE PRINCE OF WALES CAME AND SAT ON MY DOORSTEP AGAIN
2853-164187-0043 WE'LL ALL WORK TOGETHER IN THE GARDEN SHALL WE AND YOU AND MARY MUST SCOLD ME IF YOU THINK I'M NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH IT WILL BE DELICIOUS IN THE GARDEN THANKS TO THIS PLEASANT PLAN THERE WAS NOT MUCH OPPORTUNITY FOR WITHERS AND MARY TO BE IDLE
2853-164187-0044 JUST ABOUT THE TIME THAT THIS HARMONIOUS PARTY BEGAN THEIR WORK A FAR FROM HARMONIOUS COUPLE WERE BEING JUST AS INDUSTRIOUS IN THE GRAND SPACIOUS BUNKER IN FRONT OF THE TEE TO THE LAST HOLE ON THE GOLF LINKS
2853-164187-0045 AND SOLIDLY SHORED UP WITH TIMBER THE NAVY HAD
2853-164187-0046 ITS MATCH IN THE AFTERNOON WITH JUST THE LAST HOLE TO PLAY WAS ALL SQUARE SO CAPTAIN PUFFIN HAVING THE HONOUR HIT A LOW NERVOUS DRIVE THAT TAPPED LOUDLY AT THE TIMBERED WALL OF THE BUNKER
2853-164187-0047 BAD PLACE TO TOP A BALL GIVE ME THE HOLE THIS INSOLENT QUESTION NEEDED NO ANSWER AND MAJOR FLINT DROVE SKYING THE BALL TO A PRODIGIOUS HEIGHT BUT IT HAD TO COME TO EARTH SOMETIME
2853-164187-0048 AND IT FELL LIKE LUCIFER SON OF THE MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SAME BUNKER SO THE ARMY PLAYED THREE MORE AND SWEATING PROFUSELY GOT OUT
2853-164187-0049 THEN IT WAS THE NAVY'S TURN AND THE NAVY HAD TO LIE ON ITS KEEL ABOVE THE BOARDS OF THE BUNKER IN ORDER TO REACH ITS BALL AT ALL AND MISSED IT TWICE BETTER GIVE IT UP OLD CHAP SAID MAJOR FLINT UNPLAYABLE
2853-164187-0050 AT HIS THIRD ATTEMPT NOTHING HAPPENED AT THE FOURTH THE BALL FLEW AGAINST THE BOARDS REBOUNDED BRISKLY AGAIN INTO THE BUNKER TRICKLED DOWN THE STEEP SANDY SLOPE AND HIT THE MAJOR'S BOOT
2853-164187-0051 MAJOR FLINT HAD A SHORT FIT OF APHASIA HE OPENED AND SHUT HIS MOUTH AND FOAMED THEN HE TOOK A HALF CROWN FROM HIS POCKET GIVE THAT TO THE CAPTAIN HE SAID TO HIS CADDIE
2853-164187-0052 WALKED AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAM HE HAD NOT GONE A HUNDRED YARDS WHEN THE WHISTLE SOUNDED AND IT PUFFED AWAY HOMEWARDS WITH EVER INCREASING VELOCITY WEAK AND TREMBLING FROM PASSION
2853-164187-0053 AND THE TWO NO LONGER ON SPEAKING TERMS HOBBLED INTO THE CLUB HOUSE ONE AFTER THE OTHER EACH UNCONSCIOUS OF THE OTHER'S PRESENCE SUMMONING HIS LAST REMAINING STRENGTH MAJOR FLINT ROARED FOR WHISKY AND WAS TOLD THAT ACCORDING TO REGULATION
2853-164187-0054 HE COULD NOT BE SERVED UNTIL SIX THERE WAS LEMONADE AND STONE GINGER BEER YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE OFFERED A MAN EATING TIGER BREAD AND MILK EVEN THE THREAT THAT HE WOULD INSTANTLY RESIGN HIS MEMBERSHIP UNLESS PROVIDED WITH DRINK PRODUCED NO EFFECT ON A POLITE STEWARD
2853-164187-0055 AND HE SAT DOWN TO RECOVER AS BEST HE MIGHT WITH AN OLD VOLUME OF PUNCH THIS SEEMED TO DO HIM LITTLE GOOD HIS FORCED ABSTEMIOUSNESS WAS RENDERED THE MORE INTOLERABLE BY THE FACT THAT CAPTAIN PUFFIN
2853-164187-0056 AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SORRY IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET A DRINK HE TWIRLED HIS MOUSTACHE A GREAT MANY TIMES AND CLEARED HIS THROAT IT WANTED MORE THAN THAT TO CLEAR IT AND CAPITULATED UPON MY WORD PUFFIN
2853-164187-0057 NOT TAKING MY DEFEAT BETTER HE SAID A MAN'S NO BUSINESS TO LET A GAME RUFFLE HIM PUFFIN GAVE HIS ALTO CACKLING LAUGH
2853-164187-0058 HE LET THIS SINK IN THEN ADDED HAVE A DRINK OLD CHAP MAJOR FLINT FLEW TO HIS FEET WELL THANK YE THANK YE HE SAID NOW WHERE'S THAT SODA WATER YOU OFFERED ME JUST NOW HE SHOUTED TO THE STEWARD
2853-164187-0059 THE SPEED AND COMPLETENESS OF THE RECONCILIATION WAS IN NO WAY REMARKABLE FOR WHEN TWO MEN QUARREL WHENEVER THEY MEET IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY MAKE IT UP AGAIN WITH CORRESPONDING FREQUENCY ELSE THERE COULD BE NO FRESH QUARRELS AT ALL
2853-164187-0060 THIS ONE HAD BEEN A SHADE MORE ACUTE THAN MOST AND THE DROP INTO AMITY AGAIN WAS A SHADE MORE PRECIPITOUS MAJOR FLINT IN HIS EAGERNESS HAD PUT MOST OF HIS MOUSTACHE INTO THE LIFE GIVING TUMBLER AND DRIED IT ON HIS HANDKERCHIEF
2853-164187-0061 AFTER ALL IT WAS A MOST AMUSING INCIDENT HE SAID
2853-164187-0062 I'LL SERVE YOU WITH THE SAME SPOON SOME DAY AT LEAST I WOULD IF I THOUGHT IT SPORTSMANLIKE WELL WELL ENOUGH SAID ASTONISHING GOOD WHISKY THAT OF YOURS CAPTAIN PUFFIN HELPED HIMSELF TO RATHER MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT NOW REMAINED IN THE FLASK
2853-164187-0063 HELP YOURSELF MAJOR HE SAID WELL THANK YE I DON'T MIND IF I DO HE SAID REVERSING THE FLASK OVER THE TUMBLER THERE'S A GOOD TRAMP IN FRONT OF US NOW THAT THE LAST TRAM HAS GONE TRAM AND TRAMP UPON MY WORD I'VE HALF A MIND TO TELEPHONE FOR A TAXI
2853-164187-0064 THIS OF COURSE WAS A DIRECT HINT PUFFIN OUGHT CLEARLY TO PAY FOR A TAXI HAVING WON TWO HALF CROWNS TO DAY THIS CASUAL DRINK DID NOT CONSTITUTE THE USUAL DRINK STOOD BY THE WINNER AND PAID FOR WITH CASH OVER THE COUNTER A DRINK
2853-164187-0065 PUFFIN NATURALLY SAW IT IN ANOTHER LIGHT HE HAD PAID FOR THE WHISKY WHICH MAJOR FLINK HAD DRUNK OR OWED FOR IT IN HIS WINE MERCHANT'S BILL THAT WAS MONEY JUST AS MUCH AS A FLORIN PUSHED ACROSS THE COUNTER
2853-164187-0066 DONE WITH YOU SAID THE OTHER THEIR COMRADESHIP WAS NOW ON ITS MOST FELICITOUS LEVEL AGAIN AND THEY SAT ON THE BENCH OUTSIDE THE CLUB HOUSE TILL THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR UNUSUAL CONVEYANCE LUNCHING AT THE POPPIT'S TO MORROW
2853-164187-0067 BRIDGE AFTERWARDS I SUPPOSE SURE TO BE WISH THERE WAS A CHANCE OF MORE RED CURRANT FOOL THAT WAS A DECENT TIPPLE ALL BUT THE RED CURRANTS
2853-164187-0068 CAPTAIN PUFFIN WAS A GREAT CYNIC IN HIS OWN MISOGYNISTIC WAY CAMOUFLAGE FOR THE FAIR SEX HE SAID A WOMAN WILL LICK UP HALF A BOTTLE OF BRANDY IF IT'S CALLED PLUM PUDDING AND ASK FOR MORE WHEREAS IF YOU OFFERED HER A SMALL BRANDY AND SODA
2853-164187-0069 SHE WOULD THINK YOU WERE INSULTING HER BLESS THEM THE FUNNY LITTLE FAIRIES SAID THE MAJOR WELL WHAT I TELL YOU IS TRUE MAJOR SAID PUFFIN THERE'S OLD MAPP TEETOTALLER SHE CALLS HERSELF
2853-164187-0070 BIT ROSY I THOUGHT HER AS WE ESCORTED HER HOME SO SHE WAS SAID THE MAJOR SO SHE WAS SAID GOOD BYE TO US ON HER DOORSTEP AS IF SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS A PERFECT VENUS ANA ANA SOMETHING
2853-164187-0071 NOW NONE OF YOUR SAILOR TALK ASHORE CAPTAIN SAID THE MAJOR IN HIGH GOOD HUMOUR I'M NOT A MARRYING MAN ANY MORE THAN YOU ARE BETTER IF I HAD BEEN PERHAPS MORE YEARS AGO THAN I CARE TO THINK ABOUT DEAR ME MY WOUND'S GOING TO TROUBLE ME TO NIGHT
2853-164187-0072 PERHAPS A HUNDRED YEARS HENCE THE DATE I HAVE NAMED IN MY WILL FOR THEIR PUBLICATION SOMEONE MAY THINK THEM NOT SO UNINTERESTING BUT ALL THIS TOASTING AND BUTTERING AND GRILLING AND FRYING YOUR FRIENDS AND SERVING THEM UP HOT FOR ALL THE OLD CATS AT A TEA TABLE TO MEW OVER PAH
2853-164187-0073 PUFFIN WAS SILENT A MOMENT IN APPRECIATION OF THESE NOBLE SENTIMENTS BUT YOU PUT IN A LOT OF WORK OVER THEM HE SAID AT LENGTH OFTEN WHEN I'M GOING UP TO BED I SEE THE LIGHT STILL BURNING IN YOUR SITTING ROOM WINDOW
2853-164187-0074 AND IF IT COMES TO THAT REJOINED THE MAJOR I'M SURE I'VE OFTEN DOZED OFF WHEN I'M IN BED AND WOKEN AGAIN AND PULLED UP MY BLIND AND WHAT NOT AND THERE'S YOUR LIGHT STILL BURNING POWERFUL LONG ROADS THOSE OLD ROMANS MUST HAVE MADE CAPTAIN
2853-164187-0075 THE ICE WAS NOT BROKEN BUT IT WAS CRACKING IN ALL DIRECTIONS UNDER THIS UNEXAMPLED THAW THE TWO HAD CLEARLY INDICATED A MUTUAL SUSPICION OF EACH OTHER'S INDUSTRIOUS HABITS AFTER DINNER
2853-164187-0076 SAID MAJOR FLINT JUST SO BRAIN WORK'S AN EXHAUSTING PROCESS REQUIRES A LITTLE STIMULANT NOW AND AGAIN SAID PUFFIN
2853-164187-0077 AND THEN IF THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE EVENING PAPER PERHAPS I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT IT AND BLESS ME IF BY THAT TIME IT ISN'T ALREADY HALF PAST TEN OR ELEVEN AND IT SEEMS USELESS TO TACKLE ARCHOLOGY THEN AND I JUST
2853-164187-0078 JUST WHILE AWAY THE TIME TILL I'M SLEEPY BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A SORT OF LEGEND AMONG THE LADIES HERE THAT I'M A GREAT STUDENT OF LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY AND ROMAN ROADS AND ALL SORTS OF TRUCK AND I FIND IT BETTER TO LEAVE IT AT THAT TIRESOME TO GO INTO LONG EXPLANATIONS
2853-164187-0079 IN FACT ADDED PUFFIN IN A BURST OF CONFIDENCE THE STUDY I'VE DONE ON ROMAN ROADS THESE LAST SIX MONTHS WOULDN'T COVER A THREEPENNY PIECE MAJOR FLINT GAVE A LOUD CHOKING GUFFAW AND BEAT HIS FAT LEG WELL
2853-164187-0080 IF THAT'S NOT THE BEST JOKE I'VE HEARD FOR MANY A LONG DAY HE SAID THERE I'VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE YOU THESE LAST TWO YEARS SEEING YOUR LIGHT BURNING LATE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND THINKING TO MYSELF THERE'S MY FRIEND PUFFIN STILL AT IT
2853-164187-0081 FINE THING TO BE AN ENTHUSIASTIC ARCHOLOGIST LIKE THAT
2853-164187-0082 AND ALL THE TIME YOU'VE BEEN SITTING SNOOZING AND BOOZING IN YOUR CHAIR WITH YOUR GLASS HANDY TO WASH THE DUST DOWN PUFFIN ADDED HIS FALSETTO CACKLE TO THIS MERRIMENT
2853-164187-0083 THERE'S MY FRIEND THE MAJOR IN HIS STUDY OPPOSITE WITH ALL HIS DIARIES ROUND HIM MAKING A NOTE HERE AND COPYING AN EXTRACT THERE AND CONFERRING WITH THE VICEROY ONE DAY AND REPRIMANDING THE MAHARAJAH
2853-164187-0084 TOLD ME THAT I WORK TOO HARD AT NIGHT
2853-164187-0085 SIX AND EIGHT IN THE MORNING THAT'S A QUEER TIME OF DAY TO RECOMMEND AN OLD CAMPAIGNER TO BE AWAKE AT
2853-164187-0086 AND ME ON THE OTHER PULLING A LONG FACE OVER MY DIARIES AND NEITHER OF US WITH A ROMAN ROAD OR A DIARY TO OUR NAMES LET'S HAVE AN END TO SUCH UNSOCIABLE ARRANGEMENTS OLD FRIEND
2853-164187-0087 NEVER DRINK ALONE
2853-164187-0088 BUT NO MORE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT OF AN EVENING FOR BENJAMIN FLINT AS LONG AS YOU'RE AGREEABLE THE ADVENT OF THE TAXI WAS ANNOUNCED AND ARM IN ARM THEY LIMPED DOWN THE STEEP PATH TOGETHER TO THE ROAD
2853-164187-0089 A LITTLE WAY OFF TO THE LEFT WAS THE GREAT BUNKER WHICH PRIMARILY WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR PRESENT AMITY
