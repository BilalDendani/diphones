470-127690-0000 CHAPTER THREE SNOW STORMS AS HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED THE FIRST OF THE GREAT SNOW STORMS THAT REPLENISH THE YOSEMITE FOUNTAINS
470-127690-0001 AND BURROWING MARMOTS MOUNTAIN BEAVERS WOOD RATS AND OTHER SMALL MOUNTAIN PEOPLE GO INTO WINTER QUARTERS SOME OF THEM NOT AGAIN TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY UNTIL THE GENERAL AWAKENING AND RESURRECTION OF THE SPRING
470-127690-0002 IN JUNE OR JULY THE FERTILE CLOUDS DROOPING AND CONDENSING IN BROODING SILENCE SEEM TO BE THOUGHTFULLY EXAMINING THE FORESTS AND STREAMS WITH REFERENCE TO THE WORK THAT LIES BEFORE THEM
470-127690-0003 AT LENGTH ALL THEIR PLANS PERFECTED TUFTED FLAKES AND SINGLE STARRY CRYSTALS COME IN SIGHT SOLEMNLY SWIRLING AND GLINTING TO THEIR BLESSED APPOINTED PLACES
470-127690-0004 AND SOON THE BUSY THRONG FILLS THE SKY AND MAKES DARKNESS LIKE NIGHT THE FIRST HEAVY FALL IS USUALLY FROM ABOUT TWO TO FOUR FEET IN DEPTH THEN WITH INTERVALS OF DAYS OR WEEKS OF BRIGHT WEATHER
470-127690-0005 STORM SUCCEEDS STORM HEAPING SNOW ON SNOW UNTIL THIRTY TO FIFTY FEET HAS FALLEN BUT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS SETTLING AND COMPACTING AND WASTE FROM MELTING AND EVAPORATION
470-127690-0006 THE AVERAGE DEPTH ACTUALLY FOUND AT ANY TIME SELDOM EXCEEDS TEN FEET IN THE FOREST REGIONS OR FIFTEEN FEET ALONG THE SLOPES OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS AFTER SNOW STORMS COME AVALANCHES
470-127690-0007 VARYING GREATLY IN FORM SIZE BEHAVIOR AND IN THE SONGS THEY SING SOME ON THE SMOOTH SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE SHORT AND BROAD OTHERS LONG AND RIVER LIKE IN THE SIDE CANYONS OF YOSEMITES
470-127690-0008 AND IN THE MAIN CANYONS FLOWING IN REGULAR CHANNELS AND BOOMING LIKE WATERFALLS WHILE COUNTLESS SMALLER ONES FALL EVERYWHERE FROM LADEN TREES AND ROCKS AND LOFTY CANYON WALLS
470-127690-0009 THEN THE DENSE MASSES ON THE ENDS OF THE LEAFY BRANCHES BEGIN TO SHIFT AND FALL THOSE FROM THE UPPER BRANCHES STRIKING THE LOWER ONES IN SUCCESSION ENVELOPING EACH TREE IN A HOLLOW CONICAL AVALANCHE OF FAIRY FINENESS
470-127690-0010 WHILE THE RELIEVED BRANCHES SPRING UP AND WAVE WITH STARTLING EFFECT IN THE GENERAL STILLNESS AS IF EACH TREE WAS MOVING OF ITS OWN VOLITION HUNDREDS OF BROAD CLOUD SHAPED MASSES MAY ALSO BE SEEN
470-127690-0011 LEAPING OVER THE BROWS OF THE CLIFFS FROM GREAT HEIGHTS DESCENDING AT FIRST WITH REGULAR AVALANCHE SPEED UNTIL WORN INTO DUST BY FRICTION THEY FLOAT IN FRONT OF THE PRECIPICES LIKE IRISED CLOUDS
470-127690-0012 THOSE WHICH DESCEND FROM THE BROW OF EL CAPITAN ARE PARTICULARLY FINE BUT MOST OF THE GREAT YOSEMITE AVALANCHES FLOW IN REGULAR CHANNELS LIKE CASCADES AND WATERFALLS WHEN THE SNOW FIRST GIVES WAY ON THE UPPER SLOPES OF THEIR BASINS
470-127690-0013 A DULL RUSHING RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD WHICH RAPIDLY INCREASES AND SEEMS TO DRAW NEARER WITH APPALLING INTENSITY OF TONE PRESENTLY THE WHITE FLOOD COMES BOUNDING INTO SIGHT OVER BOSSES AND SHEER PLACES
470-127690-0014 LEAPING FROM BENCH TO BENCH SPREADING AND NARROWING AND THROWING OFF CLOUDS OF WHIRLING DUST LIKE THE SPRAY OF FOAMING CATARACTS COMPARED WITH WATERFALLS AND CASCADES
470-127690-0015 AVALANCHES ARE SHORT LIVED FEW OF THEM LASTING MORE THAN A MINUTE OR TWO AND THE SHARP CLASHING SOUNDS SO COMMON IN FALLING WATER ARE MOSTLY WANTING
470-127690-0016 AND IN THEIR DRESS GAIT GESTURES AND GENERAL BEHAVIOR THEY ARE MUCH ALIKE AVALANCHES
470-127690-0017 BESIDES THESE COMMON AFTER STORM AVALANCHES THAT ARE TO BE FOUND NOT ONLY IN THE YOSEMITE BUT IN ALL THE DEEP SHEER WALLED CANYON OF THE RANGE THERE ARE TWO OTHER IMPORTANT KINDS
470-127690-0018 WHICH MAY BE CALLED ANNUAL AND CENTURY AVALANCHES WHICH STILL FURTHER ENRICH THE SCENERY THE ONLY PLACE ABOUT THE VALLEY WHERE ONE MAY BE SURE TO SEE THE ANNUAL KIND IS ON THE NORTH SLOPE OF CLOUDS REST
470-127690-0019 WHERE THE SLOPES ARE INCLINED AT AN ANGLE TOO LOW TO SHED OFF THE DRY WINTER SNOW AND WHICH ACCUMULATES UNTIL THE SPRING THAWS SAP THEIR FOUNDATIONS AND MAKE THEM SLIPPERY
470-127690-0020 THEN AWAY IN GRAND STYLE GO THE PONDEROUS ICY MASSES WITHOUT ANY FINE SNOW DUST THOSE OF CLOUDS REST DESCEND LIKE THUNDERBOLTS FOR MORE THAN A MILE
470-127690-0021 THE GREAT CENTURY AVALANCHES AND THE KIND THAT MOW WIDE SWATHS THROUGH THE UPPER FORESTS OCCUR ON MOUNTAIN SIDES ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE THOUSAND FEET HIGH
470-127690-0022 WHERE UNDER ORDINARY WEATHER CONDITIONS THE SNOW ACCUMULATED FROM WINTER TO WINTER LIES AT REST FOR MANY YEARS ALLOWING TREES FIFTY TO A HUNDRED FEET HIGH TO GROW UNDISTURBED ON THE SLOPES BENEATH THEM
470-127690-0023 ON THEIR WAY DOWN THROUGH THE WOODS THEY SELDOM FAIL TO MAKE A PERFECTLY CLEAN SWEEP STRIPPING OFF THE SOIL AS WELL AS THE TREES CLEARING PATHS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS WIDE FROM THE TIMBER LINE
470-127690-0024 AND PILING THEIR UPROOTED TREES HEAD DOWNWARD IN ROWS ALONG THE SIDES OF THE GAPS LIKE LATERAL MORAINES SCARS AND BROKEN BRANCHES OF THE TREES STANDING ON THE SIDES OF THE GAPS RECORD THE DEPTH OF THE OVERWHELMING FLOOD
470-127690-0025 A RIDE ON AN AVALANCHE FEW YOSEMITE VISITORS EVER SEE SNOW AVALANCHES AND FEWER STILL KNOW THE EXHILARATION OF RIDING ON THEM
470-127690-0026 IN ALL MY MOUNTAINEERING I HAVE ENJOYED ONLY ONE AVALANCHE RIDE AND THE START WAS SO SUDDEN AND THE END CAME SO SOON I HAD BUT LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF THE DANGER THAT ATTENDS THIS SORT OF TRAVEL
470-127690-0027 THOUGH AT SUCH TIMES ONE THINKS FAST ONE FINE YOSEMITE MORNING AFTER A HEAVY SNOWFALL BEING EAGER TO SEE AS MANY AVALANCHES AS POSSIBLE AND WIDE VIEWS OF THE FOREST AND SUMMIT PEAKS IN THEIR NEW WHITE ROBES
470-127690-0028 BEFORE THE SUNSHINE HAD TIME TO CHANGE THEM I SET OUT EARLY TO CLIMB BY A SIDE CANYON TO THE TOP OF A COMMANDING RIDGE A LITTLE OVER THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LOOSENESS OF THE SNOW THAT BLOCKED THE CANYON
470-127690-0029 I KNEW THE CLIMB WOULD REQUIRE A LONG TIME SOME THREE OR FOUR HOURS AS I ESTIMATED BUT IT PROVED FAR MORE DIFFICULT THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED MOST OF THE WAY I SANK WAIST DEEP
470-127690-0030 ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT IN SOME PLACES AFTER SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY TO WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OR SO OF SUNDOWN I WAS STILL SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT THEN MY HOPES WERE REDUCED
470-127690-0031 AND I WAS SWISHED DOWN TO THE FOOT OF THE CANYON AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT THE WALLOWING ASCENT HAD TAKEN NEARLY ALL DAY THE DESCENT ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE WHEN THE AVALANCHE STARTED
470-127690-0032 I THREW MYSELF ON MY BACK AND SPREAD MY ARMS TO TRY TO KEEP FROM SINKING FORTUNATELY THOUGH THE GRADE OF THE CANYON IS VERY STEEP IT IS NOT INTERRUPTED BY PRECIPICES LARGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE OUTBOUNDING OR FREE PLUNGING
470-127690-0033 ON NO PART OF THE RUSH WAS I BURIED I WAS ONLY MODERATELY IMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OR AT TIMES A LITTLE BELOW IT AND COVERED WITH A VEIL OF BACK STREAMING DUST PARTICLES
470-127690-0034 AND AS THE WHOLE MASS BENEATH AND ABOUT ME JOINED IN THE FLIGHT THERE WAS NO FRICTION THOUGH I WAS TOSSED HERE AND THERE AND LURCHED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHEN THE AVALANCHE SWEDGED AND CAME TO REST
470-127690-0035 I FOUND MYSELF ON TOP OF THE CRUMPLED PILE WITHOUT BRUISE OR SCAR THIS WAS A FINE EXPERIENCE HAWTHORNE SAYS SOMEWHERE THAT STEAM HAS SPIRITUALIZED TRAVEL THOUGH UNSPIRITUAL SMELLS
470-127690-0036 SMOKE ET CETERA STILL ATTEND STEAM TRAVEL THIS FLIGHT IN WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A MILKY WAY OF SNOW STARS WAS THE MOST SPIRITUAL AND EXHILARATING OF ALL THE MODES OF MOTION I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
470-127690-0037 ELIJAH'S FLIGHT IN A CHARIOT OF FIRE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE GLORIOUSLY EXCITING THE STREAMS IN OTHER SEASONS IN THE SPRING
470-127690-0038 AFTER ALL THE AVALANCHES ARE DOWN AND THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST THEN ALL THE YOSEMITE STREAMS FROM THEIR FOUNTAINS TO THEIR FALLS SING THEIR GRANDEST SONGS COUNTLESS RILLS MAKE HASTE TO THE RIVERS
470-127690-0039 RUNNING AND SINGING SOON AFTER SUNRISE LOUDER AND LOUDER WITH INCREASING VOLUME UNTIL SUNDOWN THEN THEY GRADUALLY FAIL THROUGH THE FROSTY HOURS OF THE NIGHT
470-127690-0040 IN THIS WAY THE VOLUME OF THE UPPER BRANCHES OF THE RIVER IS NEARLY DOUBLED DURING THE DAY RISING AND FALLING AS REGULARLY AS THE TIDES OF THE SEA
470-127690-0041 BEGINNING TO RISE TOWARDS SUNDOWN JUST WHEN THE STREAMS ON THE FOUNTAINS ARE BEGINNING TO DIMINISH THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME OF THE DAILY RISE AND FALL BEING CAUSED BY THE DISTANCE THE UPPER FLOOD STREAMS HAVE TO TRAVEL BEFORE REACHING THE VALLEY
470-127690-0042 COMPELLING HUGE SLEEPING BOULDERS TO WAKE UP AND JOIN IN THEIR DANCE AND SONG TO SWELL THEIR EXULTING CHORUS IN EARLY SUMMER AFTER THE FLOOD SEASON THE YOSEMITE STREAMS ARE IN THEIR PRIME
470-127690-0043 RUNNING CRYSTAL CLEAR DEEP AND FULL BUT NOT OVERFLOWING THEIR BANKS ABOUT AS DEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT AS THE DAY THE DIFFERENCE IN VOLUME SO MARKED IN SPRING BEING NOW TOO SLIGHT TO BE NOTICED
470-127690-0044 NEARLY ALL THE WEATHER IS CLOUDLESS AND EVERYTHING IS AT ITS BRIGHTEST LAKE RIVER GARDEN AND FOREST WITH ALL THEIR LIFE MOST OF THE PLANTS ARE IN FULL FLOWER
470-127690-0045 AND ARE NOW SINGING THEIR BEST SONGS WITH THE STREAMS IN TRANQUIL MELLOW AUTUMN WHEN THE YEAR'S WORK IS ABOUT DONE AND THE FRUITS ARE RIPE BIRDS AND SEEDS OUT OF THEIR NESTS
470-127690-0046 AND ALL THE LANDSCAPE IS GLOWING LIKE A BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE THEN THE STREAMS ARE AT THEIR LOWEST EBB WITH SCARCE A MEMORY LEFT OF THEIR WILD SPRING FLOODS
470-127690-0047 THE SMALL TRIBUTARIES THAT DO NOT REACH BACK TO THE LASTING SNOW FOUNTAINS OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS SHRINK TO WHISPERING TINKLING CURRENTS AFTER THE SNOW IS GONE FROM THE BASINS EXCEPTING OCCASIONAL THUNDERSHOWERS
470-127690-0048 THEY ARE NOW FED ONLY BY SMALL SPRINGS WHOSE WATERS ARE MOSTLY EVAPORATED IN PASSING OVER MILES OF WARM PAVEMENTS AND IN FEELING THEIR WAY SLOWLY FROM POOL TO POOL THROUGH THE MIDST OF BOULDERS AND SAND
