6538-81858-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE FIERCE FINISH OF SHILOH
6538-81858-0001 DICK WHO HAD BEEN LYING UNDER COVER JUST BEHIND THE CREST OF ONE OF THE LOW RIDGES SUDDENLY HEARD THE LOUD BEATING OF HIS HEART HE DID NOT KNOW FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THAT THE SOUND CAME SO DISTINCTLY BECAUSE THE MIGHTY TUMULT WHICH HAD BEEN RAGING AROUND HIM ALL DAY HAD CEASED
6538-81858-0002 THOSE BLINDING FLASHES OF FLAME NO LONGER CAME FROM THE FOREST BEFORE HIM THE SHOT AND SHELL QUIT THEIR HORRIBLE SCREAMING AND THE AIR WAS FREE FROM THE UNPLEASANT HISS OF COUNTLESS BULLETS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF A LITTLE AND STOOD UP
6538-81858-0003 NOT YET REALIZING TO THE FULL THAT THE TUMULT OF THE BATTLE HAD CEASED THE BOY FELT STIFF AND SORE IN EVERY BONE AND MUSCLE AND ALTHOUGH THE CANNON AND RIFLES WERE SILENT THERE WAS STILL A HOLLOW ROARING IN HIS EARS HIS EYES WERE YET DIM FROM THE SMOKE AND HIS HEAD FELT HEAVY AND DULL
6538-81858-0004 AND SUDDENLY A GRAY SQUIRREL HOPPED OUT ON A BOUGH AND BEGAN TO CHATTER WILDLY DICK DESPITE HIMSELF LAUGHED BUT THE LAUGH WAS HYSTERICAL HE COULD APPRECIATE THE FEELINGS OF THE SQUIRREL WHICH PROBABLY HAD BEEN IMPRISONED IN A HOLLOW OF THE TREE ALL DAY LONG LISTENING TO THIS TREMENDOUS BATTLE
6538-81858-0005 THE TWILIGHT WAS FAST DEEPENING INTO NIGHT THE LAST ROSY GLOW OF THE SUN FADED AND THICK DARKNESS ENVELOPED THE VAST FOREST IN WHICH TWENTY THOUSAND MEN HAD FALLEN AND IN WHICH MOST OF THEM YET LAY THE WOUNDED WITH THE DEAD
6538-81858-0006 NO DICK MY BOY NONE FOR THE PRESENT REPLIED THE COLONEL A LITTLE SADLY HALF OF MY POOR REGIMENT IS KILLED OR WOUNDED AND THE REST ARE SO EXHAUSTED THAT THEY ARE BARELY ABLE TO MOVE BUT THEY FOUGHT MAGNIFICENTLY DICK THEY HAD TO OR BE CRUSHED
6538-81858-0007 AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO WOULD HAVE GONE HAD NOT NIGHT COME TO OUR HELP THEN WE HAVE BEEN BEATEN YES DICK WE HAVE BEEN BEATEN AND BEATEN BADLY IT WAS THE SURPRISE THAT DID IT HOW ON EARTH WE COULD HAVE LET THE SOUTHERN ARMY CREEP UPON US AND STRIKE UNAWARE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
6538-81858-0008 SOME PRISONERS WHOM WE HAVE TAKEN SAY THAT JOHNSTON HAS BEEN KILLED AND BEAUREGARD IS NO SUCH LEADER AS HE WILL THE ARMY OF GENERAL BUELL REACH US TONIGHT BUELL HIMSELF IS HERE HE HAS BEEN WITH GRANT FOR SOME TIME AND ALL HIS BRIGADES ARE MARCHING AT THE DOUBLE QUICK
6538-81858-0009 LEW WALLACE ARRIVED LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR AGO WITH SEVEN THOUSAND MEN FRESH AND EAGER FOR BATTLE DICK DICK MY BOY WE'LL HAVE FORTY THOUSAND NEW TROOPS ON THE FIELD AT THE NEXT DAWN AND BEFORE GOD WE'LL WIPE OUT THE DISGRACE OF TODAY LISTEN TO THE BIG GUNS FROM THE BOATS AS THEY SPEAK AT INTERVALS
6538-81858-0010 THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES WERE DILATED AND A RED SPOT GLOWED IN EITHER CHEEK LIKE ALL THE OTHER OFFICERS HE WAS STUNG BY THE SURPRISE AND DEFEAT AND HE COULD BARELY WAIT FOR THE MORNING AND REVENGE COLONEL WINCHESTER WALKED AWAY TO A COUNCIL THAT HAD BEEN CALLED
6538-81858-0011 AND DICK TURNED TO PENNINGTON AND WARNER WHO WERE NOT HURT SAVE FOR SLIGHT WOUNDS WARNER HAD RECOVERED HIS POISE AND WAS SOON AS CALM AND DRY AS EVER DICK HE SAID WE'RE SOME DISTANCE FROM WHERE WE STARTED THIS MORNING THERE'S NOTHING LIKE BEING SHOVED ALONG WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
6538-81858-0012 I HAD A NUMBER OF LOOKS AT IT REPLIED WARNER AND I SHOULD SAY FROM THE WAY IT ACTED THAT IT NUMBERED AT LEAST THREE MILLION MEN I KNOW THAT AT TIMES NOT LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND WERE AIMING THEIR RIFLES AT MY OWN POOR AND UNWORTHY PERSON WHAT A WASTE OF ENERGY FOR SO MANY MEN TO SHOOT AT ME ALL AT ONCE
6538-81858-0013 BUT IN A FEW SECONDS HE RECOVERED HIMSELF AND LOOKED RATHER ASHAMED BOYS HE SAID I APOLOGIZE YOU NEEDN'T SAID PENNINGTON
6538-81858-0014 SERGEANT DANIEL WHITLEY WAS LEANING AGAINST A STUMP AND WHILE HE WAS CALMLY LIGHTING A PIPE HE REGARDED THE THREE BOYS WITH A BENEVOLENT GAZE NONE OF YOU NEED BE ASHAMED OF BEIN SCARED HE SAID I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF FIGHTS MYSELF THOUGH ALL OF THEM WERE MERE SKIRMISHES WHEN PUT ALONGSIDE OF THIS
6538-81858-0015 WHAT IS IT DICK ASKED WARNER I'VE REALIZED ALL AT ONCE THAT I'M TREMENDOUSLY HUNGRY THE CONFEDERATES BROKE UP OUR BREAKFAST WE NEVER HAD TIME TO THINK OF DINNER AND NOW ITS NOTHING TO EAT ME TOO SAID PENNINGTON
6538-81858-0016 IF YOU WERE TO HIT ME IN THE STOMACH I'D GIVE BACK A HOLLOW SOUND LIKE A DRUM WHY DON'T SOMEBODY RING THE SUPPER BELL BUT FIRES WERE SOON LIGHTED ALONG THEIR WHOLE FRONT AND PROVISIONS WERE BROUGHT UP FROM THE REAR AND FROM THE STEAMERS THE SOLDIERS FEELING THEIR STRENGTH RETURNING ATE RAVENOUSLY
6538-81858-0017 THEY ALSO TALKED MUCH OF THE BATTLE MANY OF THEM WERE YET UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HYSTERICAL EXCITEMENT THEY TOLD EXTRAORDINARY STORIES OF THE THINGS THEY HAD SEEN AND DONE AND THEY BELIEVED ALL THEY TOLD WERE TRUE
6538-81858-0018 THEY ATE FIERCELY AT FIRST ALMOST LIKE WOLVES BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY RESOLVED INTO THEIR TRUE STATE AS AMIABLE YOUNG HUMAN BEINGS AND WERE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES ALL THE WHILE BUELL'S ARMY OF THE OHIO WAS PASSING OVER THE RIVER AND JOINING GRANT'S ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE
6538-81858-0019 REGIMENT AFTER REGIMENT AND BRIGADE AFTER BRIGADE CROSSED THE GUNS THAT NELSON HAD BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE BEHIND WERE ALSO BROUGHT UP AND WERE TAKEN OVER WITH THE OTHER BATTERIES
6538-81858-0020 WHILE THE SHATTERED REMNANTS OF THE ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE WERE RESTING THE FRESH ARMY OF THE OHIO WAS MARCHING BY IT IN THE LATE HOURS OF THE NIGHT IN ORDER TO FACE THE SOUTHERN FOE IN THE MORNING THE SOUTHERN ARMY ITSELF LAY DEEP IN THE WOODS FROM WHICH IT HAD DRIVEN ITS ENEMY
6538-81858-0021 ALWAYS THE ASSAILANT THROUGH THE DAY ITS LOSSES HAD BEEN IMMENSE MANY THOUSANDS HAD FALLEN AND NO NEW TROOPS WERE COMING TO TAKE THEIR PLACE CONTINUAL REINFORCEMENTS CAME TO THE NORTH THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT NOT A SOLDIER CAME TO THE SOUTH
6538-81858-0022 BEAUREGARD AT DAWN WOULD HAVE TO FACE TWICE HIS NUMBERS AT LEAST HALF OF WHOM WERE FRESH TROOPS ANOTHER CONFERENCE WAS HELD BY THE SOUTHERN GENERALS IN THE FOREST BUT NOW THE CENTRAL FIGURE THE GREAT JOHNSTON WAS GONE
6538-81858-0023 THE OTHERS HOWEVER SUMMONED THEIR COURAGE ANEW AND PASSED THE WHOLE NIGHT ARRANGING THEIR FORCES CHEERING THE MEN AND PREPARING FOR THE MORN THEIR SCOUTS AND SKIRMISHERS KEPT WATCH ON THE NORTHERN CAMP AND THE SOUTHERNERS BELIEVED THAT WHILE THEY HAD WHIPPED ONLY ONE ARMY THE DAY BEFORE THEY COULD WHIP TWO ON THE MORROW
6538-81858-0024 DICK FROM A HIGH POINT ON WHICH HE LAY SAW THE DARK SURFACE OF THE TENNESSEE AND THE LIGHTS ON THE PUFFING STEAMERS AS THEY CROSSED BEARING THE ARMY OF THE OHIO HIS MIND DID NOT WORK ACTIVELY NOW BUT HE FELT THAT THEY WERE SAVED
6538-81858-0025 AND IT WAS IN FACT A BARRIER MORE AND MORE AS WITHOUT ITS COMMAND THE SECOND UNION ARMY COULD NEVER HAVE COME TO THE RELIEF OF THE FIRST DICK AFTER A WHILE SAW COLONEL WINCHESTER AND OTHER OFFICERS NEAR HIM THEY WERE TALKING OF THEIR LOSSES
6538-81858-0026 THEY GAVE THE NAMES OF MANY GENERALS AND COLONELS WHO HAD BEEN KILLED PRESENTLY THEY MOVED AWAY AND HE FELL INTO AN UNEASY SLEEP OR RATHER DOZE FROM WHICH HE WAS AWAKENED AFTER A WHILE BY A HEAVY RUMBLING SOUND OF A DISTANT CANNONADE THE BOY SPRANG UP WONDERING WHY ANY ONE SHOULD WISH TO RENEW THE BATTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
6538-81858-0027 AND THEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS NO BATTLE THE SOUND WAS THUNDER ROLLING HEAVILY ON THE SOUTHERN HORIZON AND THE NIGHT HAD BECOME VERY DARK VIVID FLASHES OF LIGHTNING CUT THE SKY AND A STRONG WIND RUSHED AMONG THE TREES
6538-81858-0028 THEIR PULSES BECAME STRONGER AND THE BLOOD FLOWED IN A QUICKENED TORRENT THROUGH THEIR VEINS THEY LET IT POUR UPON THEM MERELY SEEKING TO KEEP THEIR AMMUNITION DRY TEN THOUSAND WOUNDED WERE YET LYING UNTOUCHED IN THE FOREST BUT THE RAIN WAS GRATEFUL TO THEM TOO
6538-81858-0029 WHEN THEY COULD THEY TURNED THEIR FEVERED FACES UP TO IT THAT IT MIGHT BEAT UPON THEM AND BRING GRATEFUL COOLNESS DEEP IN THE NIGHT A COUNCIL LIKE THAT OF THE SOUTHERN GENERALS WAS HELD IN THE NORTHERN CAMP ALSO GRANT HIS FACE AN EXPRESSIONLESS MASK PRESIDED AND SAID BUT LITTLE
6538-81858-0030 GRANT AFTER A DAY IN WHICH ANY ONE OF A DOZEN CHANCES WOULD HAVE WRECKED HIM MUST HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IN VERY DEED AND TRUTH HE WAS THE FAVORITE CHILD OF FORTUNE WHEN ONE IS SAVED AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM THE VERY VERGE HE BEGINS TO BELIEVE THAT FAILURE IS IMPOSSIBLE
6538-81858-0031 THE SOUTHERN ARMY MUST HAVE SUFFERED ALMOST EQUALLY SO AND WOULD FACE THEM AT DAWN WITH NUMBERS FAR LESS THAN THEIR OWN HE HAD NOT DISPLAYED THE GREATEST SKILL BUT HE HAD SHOWN THE GREATEST MORAL COURAGE AND NOW ON THE NIGHT BETWEEN BATTLES IT WAS THAT QUALITY THAT WAS NEEDED MOST
6538-81858-0032 DICK NOT HAVING SLEPT ANY THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HAVING PASSED THROUGH A DAY OF FIERCE BATTLE WAS OVERCOME AFTER MIDNIGHT AND SANK INTO A SLEEP THAT WAS MERE LETHARGY HE AWOKE ONCE BEFORE DAWN AND REMEMBERED BUT VAGUELY ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED YET HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THERE WAS MUCH MOVEMENT IN THE FOREST
6538-81858-0033 SENT HUGE SHELLS CURVING INTO THE FOREST TOWARD THE CAMP OF THE SOUTHERN ARMY HE ALSO SAW NEAR HIM WARNER AND PENNINGTON SOUND ASLEEP ON THE GROUND AND THEN HE SANK BACK INTO HIS OWN LETHARGIC SLUMBER
6538-81858-0034 IT WAS NOT YET DAWN AND A LIGHT RAIN WAS FALLING BUT SMOLDERING FIRES DISCLOSED THE GROUND FOR SOME DISTANCE AND ALSO THE RIVER ON WHICH THE GUNBOATS AND TRANSPORTS WERE NOW GATHERED IN A FLEET COLONEL WINCHESTER BECKONED TO HIM ALL RIGHT THIS MORNING DICK HE SAID
6538-81858-0035 YES SIR I'M READY FOR MY DUTY AND YOU TOO WARNER AND PENNINGTON WE ARE SIR THEY REPLIED TOGETHER THEN KEEP CLOSE BESIDE ME I DON'T KNOW WHEN I MAY WANT YOU FOR A MESSAGE DAYBREAK WILL BE HERE IN A HALF HOUR
6538-81858-0036 THE ENTIRE ARMY OF THE OHIO LED BY GENERAL BUELL IN PERSON WILL BE IN POSITION THEN OR VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARD AND A NEW AND WE HOPE A VERY DIFFERENT BATTLE WILL BEGIN FOOD AND COFFEE WERE SERVED TO THE MEN AND WHILE THE RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THEY FORMED IN LINE AND AWAITED THE DAWN
6538-81858-0037 THE DESIRE TO RETRIEVE THEIR FORTUNES WAS AS STRONG AMONG THE FARMER LADS AS IT WAS AMONG THE OFFICERS WHO TOOK CARE TO SPREAD AMONG THEM THE STATEMENT THAT BUELL'S ARMY ALONE WAS AS NUMEROUS AS THE SOUTHERN FORCE AND PROBABLY MORE NUMEROUS SINCE THEIR ENEMY MUST HAVE SUSTAINED TERRIBLE LOSSES
