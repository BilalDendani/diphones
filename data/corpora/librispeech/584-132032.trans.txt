584-132032-0000 WHILE THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE GOING ON IN THE RECEPTION ROOM AND THE PRINCESS ROOM A CARRIAGE CONTAINING PIERRE WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR
584-132032-0001 WAS DRIVING INTO THE COURT OF COUNT BEZUKHOV'S HOUSE AS THE WHEELS ROLLED SOFTLY OVER THE STRAW BENEATH THE WINDOWS
584-132032-0002 HAVING TURNED WITH WORDS OF COMFORT TO HER COMPANION REALIZED THAT HE WAS ASLEEP IN HIS CORNER AND WOKE HIM UP ROUSING HIMSELF
584-132032-0003 AND ONLY THEN BEGAN TO THINK OF THE INTERVIEW WITH HIS DYING FATHER WHICH AWAITED HIM HE NOTICED THAT THEY HAD NOT COME TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE BUT TO THE BACK DOOR
584-132032-0004 WHILE HE WAS GETTING DOWN FROM THE CARRIAGE STEPS TWO MEN WHO LOOKED LIKE TRADESPEOPLE RAN HURRIEDLY FROM THE ENTRANCE AND HID IN THE SHADOW OF THE WALL PAUSING FOR A MOMENT
584-132032-0005 OF THE SAME KIND HIDING IN THE SHADOW OF THE HOUSE ON BOTH SIDES
584-132032-0006 NOR THE COACHMAN WHO COULD NOT HELP SEEING THESE PEOPLE TOOK ANY NOTICE OF THEM IT SEEMS TO BE ALL RIGHT PIERRE CONCLUDED AND FOLLOWED ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA
584-132032-0007 SHE HURRIEDLY ASCENDED THE NARROW DIMLY LIT STONE STAIRCASE CALLING TO PIERRE WHO WAS LAGGING BEHIND TO FOLLOW THOUGH
584-132032-0008 HALFWAY UP THE STAIRS THEY WERE ALMOST KNOCKED OVER BY SOME MEN WHO CARRYING PAILS CAME RUNNING DOWNSTAIRS THEIR BOOTS CLATTERING THESE MEN PRESSED CLOSE TO THE WALL
584-132032-0009 TO LET PIERRE AND ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA PASS AND DID NOT EVINCE THE LEAST SURPRISE AT SEEING THEM THERE IS THIS THE WAY TO THE PRINCESSES APARTMENTS
584-132032-0010 ASKED ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OF ONE OF THEM YES REPLIED A FOOTMAN IN A BOLD LOUD VOICE AS IF ANYTHING WERE NOW PERMISSIBLE THE DOOR TO THE LEFT MA'AM
584-132032-0011 PERHAPS THE COUNT DID NOT ASK FOR ME SAID PIERRE WHEN HE REACHED THE LANDING I'D BETTER GO TO MY OWN ROOM ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA PAUSED AND WAITED FOR HIM TO COME UP
584-132032-0012 AH MY FRIEND SHE SAID TOUCHING HIS ARM AS SHE HAD DONE HER SON'S WHEN SPEAKING TO HIM THAT AFTERNOON BELIEVE ME I SUFFER NO LESS THAN YOU DO BUT BE A MAN
584-132032-0013 BUT REALLY HADN'T I BETTER GO AWAY HE ASKED
584-132032-0014 PIERRE HAD NEVER BEEN IN THIS PART OF THE HOUSE AND DID NOT EVEN KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THESE ROOMS
584-132032-0015 ADDRESSING A MAID WHO WAS HURRYING PAST WITH A DECANTER ON A TRAY AS MY DEAR AND MY SWEET ASKED ABOUT THE PRINCESS HEALTH AND THEN LED PIERRE ALONG A STONE PASSAGE
584-132032-0016 EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE WAS DONE IN HASTE AT THAT TIME AND PIERRE AND ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA IN PASSING INSTINCTIVELY GLANCED INTO THE ROOM WHERE PRINCE VASILI AND THE ELDEST PRINCESS
584-132032-0017 WERE SITTING CLOSE TOGETHER TALKING SEEING THEM PASS
584-132032-0018 WHILE THE PRINCESS JUMPED UP AND WITH A GESTURE OF DESPERATION
584-132032-0019 WITH ALL HER MIGHT THIS ACTION WAS SO UNLIKE HER USUAL COMPOSURE AND THE FEAR DEPICTED ON PRINCE VASILI'S FACE SO OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS DIGNITY
584-132032-0020 THAT PIERRE STOPPED AND GLANCED INQUIRINGLY OVER HIS SPECTACLES AT HIS GUIDE ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA EVINCED NO SURPRISE SHE ONLY SMILED FAINTLY AND SIGHED AS IF TO SAY
584-132032-0021 THAT THIS WAS NO MORE THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED BE A MAN MY FRIEND I WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR INTERESTS SAID SHE IN REPLY TO HIS LOOK
584-132032-0022 AND WENT STILL FASTER ALONG THE PASSAGE PIERRE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT AND STILL LESS WHAT WATCHING OVER HIS INTERESTS MEANT
584-132032-0023 BUT HE DECIDED THAT ALL THESE THINGS HAD TO BE FROM THE PASSAGE THEY WENT INTO A LARGE DIMLY LIT ROOM ADJOINING THE COUNT'S RECEPTION ROOM
584-132032-0024 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SUMPTUOUS BUT COLD APARTMENTS KNOWN TO PIERRE ONLY FROM THE FRONT APPROACH BUT EVEN IN THIS ROOM THERE NOW STOOD AN EMPTY BATH AND WATER HAD BEEN SPILLED ON THE CARPET
584-132032-0025 THEY WERE MET BY A DEACON WITH A CENSER AND BY A SERVANT WHO PASSED OUT ON TIPTOE WITHOUT HEEDING THEM THEY WENT INTO THE RECEPTION ROOM FAMILIAR TO PIERRE
584-132032-0026 WITH ITS LARGE BUST AND FULL LENGTH PORTRAIT OF CATHERINE THE GREAT THE SAME PEOPLE
584-132032-0027 AND AT THE BIG STOUT FIGURE OF PIERRE WHO HANGING HIS HEAD MEEKLY FOLLOWED HER
584-132032-0028 ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S FACE EXPRESSED A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE DECISIVE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED WITH THE AIR OF A PRACTICAL PETERSBURG LADY SHE NOW
584-132032-0029 KEEPING PIERRE CLOSE BESIDE HER ENTERED THE ROOM EVEN MORE BOLDLY THAN THAT AFTERNOON SHE FELT THAT AS SHE BROUGHT WITH HER THE PERSON
584-132032-0030 THE DYING MAN WISHED TO SEE HER OWN ADMISSION WAS ASSURED CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AT ALL THOSE IN THE ROOM AND NOTICING THE COUNT'S CONFESSOR THERE SHE GLIDED UP TO HIM WITH A SORT OF AMBLE
584-132032-0031 ALL WE RELATIVES HAVE BEEN IN SUCH ANXIETY THIS YOUNG MAN IS THE COUNT'S SON SHE ADDED MORE SOFTLY WHAT A TERRIBLE MOMENT
584-132032-0032 HAVING SAID THIS SHE WENT UP TO THE DOCTOR DEAR DOCTOR SAID SHE THIS YOUNG MAN IS THE COUNT'S SON IS THERE ANY HOPE
584-132032-0033 THE DOCTOR CAST A RAPID GLANCE UPWARDS AND SILENTLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
584-132032-0034 ALMOST CLOSING THE LATTER SIGHED AND MOVED AWAY FROM THE DOCTOR TO PIERRE TO HIM IN A PARTICULARLY RESPECTFUL AND TENDERLY SAD VOICE
584-132032-0035 MERCY AND POINTING OUT A SMALL SOFA FOR HIM TO SIT AND WAIT FOR HER SHE WENT SILENTLY TOWARD THE DOOR THAT EVERYONE WAS WATCHING
584-132032-0036 AS SOON AS ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA HAD DISAPPEARED HE NOTICED THAT THE EYES OF ALL IN THE ROOM TURNED TO HIM WITH SOMETHING MORE THAN CURIOSITY AND SYMPATHY HE NOTICED THAT THEY WHISPERED TO ONE ANOTHER
584-132032-0037 CASTING SIGNIFICANT LOOKS AT HIM WITH A KIND OF AWE AND EVEN SERVILITY
584-132032-0038 A STRANGE LADY THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TO THE PRIESTS ROSE AND OFFERED HIM HER SEAT AN AIDE DE CAMP PICKED UP AND RETURNED A GLOVE PIERRE HAD DROPPED
584-132032-0039 THE DOCTORS BECAME RESPECTFULLY SILENT AS HE PASSED BY AND MOVED TO MAKE WAY FOR HIM
584-132032-0040 AND ALSO TO PICK UP THE GLOVE HIMSELF AND TO PASS ROUND THE DOCTORS WHO WERE NOT EVEN IN HIS WAY BUT ALL AT ONCE HE FELT THAT THIS WOULD NOT DO AND THAT TONIGHT
584-132032-0041 HE WAS A PERSON OBLIGED TO PERFORM SOME SORT OF AWFUL RITE WHICH EVERYONE EXPECTED OF HIM AND THAT HE WAS THEREFORE BOUND TO ACCEPT THEIR SERVICES HE TOOK THE GLOVE IN SILENCE FROM THE AIDE DE CAMP
584-132032-0042 AND SAT DOWN IN THE LADY'S CHAIR PLACING HIS HUGE HANDS SYMMETRICALLY ON HIS KNEES IN THE NAIVE ATTITUDE OF AN EGYPTIAN STATUE AND DECIDED IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ALL WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
584-132032-0043 AND THAT IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE HIS HEAD AND DO FOOLISH THINGS HE MUST NOT ACT ON HIS OWN IDEAS TONIGHT BUT MUST YIELD HIMSELF UP ENTIRELY TO THE WILL OF THOSE WHO WERE GUIDING HIM
584-132032-0044 NOT TWO MINUTES HAD PASSED BEFORE PRINCE VASILI WITH HEAD ERECT MAJESTICALLY ENTERED THE ROOM
584-132032-0045 HE SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN THINNER SINCE THE MORNING HIS EYES SEEMED LARGER THAN USUAL WHEN HE GLANCED ROUND AND NOTICED PIERRE HE WENT UP TO HIM TOOK HIS HAND A THING HE NEVER USED TO DO
584-132032-0046 AND HE TURNED TO GO BUT PIERRE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO ASK HOW IS AND HESITATED NOT KNOWING WHETHER IT WOULD BE PROPER TO CALL THE DYING MAN
584-132032-0047 AND ONLY LATER GRASPED THAT A STROKE WAS AN ATTACK OF ILLNESS PRINCE VASILI SAID SOMETHING TO LORRAIN IN PASSING AND WENT THROUGH THE DOOR ON TIPTOE
584-132032-0048 THE ELDEST PRINCESS FOLLOWED HIM AND THE PRIESTS AND DEACONS AND SOME SERVANTS ALSO WENT IN AT THE DOOR THROUGH THAT DOOR
