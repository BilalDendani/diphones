557-129797-0000 WITH A SKILL OF WHICH HE MIGHT JUSTLY BE PROUD HAVING DESTROYED A FORCE SO SUPERIOR IN SHIPS AND GUNS AND MEN THAT DON MIGUEL DE ESPINOSA HAD JUSTIFIABLY DEEMED IT OVERWHELMING
557-129797-0001 HIS VICTORY WAS RENDERED BARREN BY THREE LUCKY SHOTS FROM AN UNSUSPECTED BATTERY BY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND BARREN MUST THEIR VICTORY REMAIN UNTIL THEY COULD REDUCE THE FORT THAT STILL REMAINED TO DEFEND THE PASSAGE
557-129797-0002 AT FIRST CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS FOR PUTTING HIS SHIPS IN ORDER AND MAKING THE ATTEMPT THERE AND THEN BUT THE OTHERS DISSUADED HIM FROM BETRAYING AN IMPETUOSITY USUALLY FOREIGN TO HIM AND BORN ENTIRELY OF CHAGRIN AND MORTIFICATION
557-129797-0003 EMOTIONS WHICH WILL RENDER UNREASONABLE THE MOST REASONABLE OF MEN WITH RETURNING CALM HE SURVEYED THE SITUATION
557-129797-0004 WAS ALMOST AS SORELY DAMAGED BY THE FIRE SHE HAD SUSTAINED FROM THE BUCCANEERS BEFORE SURRENDERING CLEARLY THEN HE WAS COMPELLED TO ADMIT IN THE END THAT NOTHING REMAINED
557-129797-0005 THERE TO REFIT THE SHIPS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO FORCE THE PASSAGE AND SO BACK TO MARACAYBO CAME THOSE DEFEATED VICTORS OF THAT SHORT TERRIBLE FIGHT AND IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN WANTING FURTHER TO EXASPERATE THEIR LEADER
557-129797-0006 HE HAD IT IN THE PESSIMISM OF WHICH CAHUSAC DID NOT ECONOMIZE EXPRESSIONS TRANSPORTED AT FIRST TO HEIGHTS OF DIZZY SATISFACTION BY THE SWIFT AND EASY VICTORY OF THEIR INFERIOR FORCE THAT MORNING
557-129797-0007 THE FRENCHMAN WAS NOW PLUNGED BACK AND MORE DEEPLY THAN EVER INTO THE ABYSS OF HOPELESSNESS AND HIS MOOD INFECTED AT LEAST THE MAIN BODY OF HIS OWN FOLLOWERS IT IS THE END HE TOLD CAPTAIN BLOOD THIS TIME WE ARE CHECKMATED

557-129797-0009 YOU CALL ME A COWARD I'LL TAKE THAT LIBERTY THE BRETON GLARED AT HIM BREATHING HARD BUT HE HAD NO MIND TO ASK SATISFACTION FOR THE INSULT HE KNEW TOO WELL THE KIND OF SATISFACTION
557-129797-0010 THAT CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS LIKELY TO AFFORD HIM HE REMEMBERED THE FATE OF LEVASSEUR SO HE CONFINED HIMSELF TO WORDS IT IS TOO MUCH YOU GO TOO FAR HE COMPLAINED BITTERLY LOOK YOU CAHUSAC
