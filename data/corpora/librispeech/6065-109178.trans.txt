6065-109178-0000 THE MAN ROACH YEARS WENT BY AND GRIM GREW INTO A SPLENDID FISH HER LONG FLAT FOREHEAD WAS NOW CONTINUED STRAIGHT
6065-109178-0001 A HOLLOW IN THE MIDDLE ENABLED IT AS IT WERE TO PROJECT IN CANOPIES THAT HUNG DOWN OVER HER EYES WHICH THUS ACQUIRED AN EXPRESSION EVEN MORE CRUEL AND SCOWLING
6065-109178-0002 THE CHEEKS STOOD PERPENDICULARLY ON EACH SIDE OF THE FOREHEAD AND ENCLOSED THE CRANIUM AS BETWEEN WALLS IT WAS AS THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A DENT ON BOTH SIDES OF HER HEAD THE BACK OF HER NECK SWELLED UP LIKE THAT OF A BULL
6065-109178-0003 FOR HERE THE MUSCLES LAY OVER THE CRANIUM IN LARGE THICK CURVES UNTIL DOWN BY THE NECK THEY GAVE PLACE EACH TO ITS BRANCHIAL CLEFT WHICH WAS AS LARGE AS A BARN DOOR AND WHAT A MOUTH
6065-109178-0004 IT OPENED UP FAR PAST THE EYES GENERALLY IT ONLY STOOD AJAR BUT TO LOOK INTO IT WHEN IT OPENED WIDE WAS LIKE LOOKING INTO A BARREL STUDDED WITH NAILS
6065-109178-0005 THE TEETH STOOD THICK AS PINS IN A PINCUSHION THEY WERE SMALL AND POINTED AND SLOPED BACKWARDS SO THAT THEY SERVED AS BARBS IN ALONG THE SIDES CAME THE LONG WIDELY SEPARATED INCISORS
6065-109178-0006 WHOSE PURPOSE WAS TO ENTER INTO AND HOLD FAST THE PREY THEY WERE MORE THAN HALF AN INCH IN LENGTH ROUNDED AND BLUNT AND RESEMBLED THE TEETH OF A RAKE
6065-109178-0007 THE UPPER JAW WAS PROVIDED WITH A FAR MORE TERRIBLE ARMATURE WHOLE ROWS OF HARROW LIKE TEETH STOOD OUT MAKING A DIABOLICAL GRATER OF THE PALATE THEY CONTINUED FAR DOWN THE THROAT
6065-109178-0008 AND EVEN CAME FORWARD OVER THE TONGUE WOE TO THE BODY THAT BECAME JAMMED HERE IT WAS ONLY RELEASED AS MINCE MEAT BUT THE THROAT THAT SWALLOWED THE VICTIM WAS BY FAR THE MOST HORRIBLE CONTRIVANCE
6065-109178-0009 IT RESEMBLED THE DRAWN UP MOUTH OF A SACK DOWN THROUGH IT LAY GREAT ROLLS OF SWALLOWING MUSCLES STUDDED WITH GRASPING PROTUBERANCES IN THE MIDST OF THEM THE OESOPHAGUS WAS DISCERNIBLE
6065-109178-0010 WITH A SUCTION THAT INEXORABLY DREW EVERYTHING DOWN WITH IT AND HER EXTERNAL EQUIPMENT CORRESPONDED TO HER INTERNAL THE WONDERFUL DARK COLOURS OF THE SHALLOWS DREW A BROAD STRIPE ALONG HER GREAT BACK
6065-109178-0011 ABOUT THE FOREHEAD AND ALONG THE BACK OF THE NECK THE WATER GRASSES HAD LAID A GROUND WASH OF THEIR OWN DEEP GREEN AND HER SIDES WERE VEILED BY THE FLICKERING STREAKS OF THE REED BEDS PATCHES OF GOLD
6065-109178-0012 LIKE THE SUNSHINE FALLING THROUGH THE GLASSY SURFACE OF THE WATER SHONE OUT BETWEEN THE TRANSVERSE STRIPES ON HER SIDES AND OVER THE BRANCHIAL ARCH AND THE BELLY LAY THE PURE WHITENESS OF THE WATER LILY YES
6065-109178-0013 SHE WAS ADORNED IN ALL HER SPLENDOUR HER SCALES GLEAMED WITH THE RAYS OF THE SUN AND MOON AND WHEN WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING SHE MADE A DART IT SEEMED LIKE THE TWINKLING OF STARS IN THE DARK NIGHT OF THE DEEP WATERS
6065-109178-0014 FROM THIS TIME ONWARDS HER VORACITY KNEW NO BOUNDS THE DESIRE FOR FOOD WHICH SHE HAD POSSESSED FROM HER EARLIEST DAYS AND WHICH HAD LAIN LIKE A GERM IN THE VERY HEART OF HER NATURE WAS GIVEN FREE PLAY
6065-109178-0015 BY MEANS OF THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS THAT NATURE HAD PLACED AT HER DISPOSAL NO ONE ELSE SHOULD NOW GET A BITE SHE WOULD BE ALONE IN CLEARING THE WATERS OF FOOD
6065-109178-0016 SHE NOW AS READILY SEIZED HER PREY LENGTHWISE AS CROSS WISE INDEED SHE EVEN PREFERRED WHEN HUNGRY TO MAKE STRAIGHT FOR THE HEAD
6065-109178-0017 SHE WASTED NO TIME IN TURNING IT BUT COULD SWALLOW IT AT ONCE BY NATURE SHE WAS VERY RESERVED AND HAD NO DESIRE FOR COMPANIONSHIP BUT HER MENTAL ABILITIES WERE BY NO MEANS SMALL
6065-109178-0018 AND SHE WAS WELL ABLE TO MAKE VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS AND PROFIT BY THEIR LESSONS NOR WAS SHE DEFICIENT IN MEMORY AS SHE DISTINCTLY SHOWED EVERY SPRING WHEN GOING TO SPAWN
6065-109178-0019 SHE ALWAYS FOUND HER WAY UP THE BROOK TO THE WIDE FEN SHE WAS VERY SENSITIVE TO EVERY MOVEMENT IN THE WATER AND IN A WAY HEARD WITH EASE THE BOATS THE BIG BIRDS
6065-109178-0020 THEY ALWAYS SPLASHED SO MUCH WITH THEIR OAR FEET OR WHISKED THEIR TAIL ROUND IN THE WATER SHE HAD OFTEN WONDERED AT THEM SHE HAD DISCOVERED THAT LIKE THE GREBE THEY CARRIED THEIR YOUNG ON THEIR BACK AND
6065-109178-0021 LIKE ALL THE OTHER FISH IN THE LAKE SHE SUPPOSED THEM TO BE A PART OF THE UNREST UP ON THE SURFACE LONG BEFORE THEY CAME NEAR HER SHE WAS DISTINCTLY AWARE OF THEIR APPROACH IF SHE WERE HIGH IN THE WATER
6065-109178-0022 AND THE BIRD SUDDENLY RUSHED DOWN TOWARDS HER SHE DARTED TO ONE SIDE AND HASTENED OUT OF THE WAY IT WAS DIFFERENT WHEN THE BOAT CAME SLOWLY GLIDING ALONG THEN SHE ONLY MOVED SO AS NOT TO BE RUN DOWN
6065-109178-0023 BUT IT WAS MANY A DAY BEFORE SHE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS THEY ESPECIALLY WHO WANTED TO HARM HER ONE EVENING THE OLD ANGLER WAS ROWING HOME LATE FROM HIS FISHING GROUND
6065-109178-0024 THE MOON HAD RISEN AND SHED HER SILVERY LIGHT AROUND HIS OARS THEY DIPPED DOWN RHYTHMICALLY AND CAME UP WITH THE SILVER DRIPPING FROM THEM SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THEM STRUCK SOMETHING
6065-109178-0025 AND THE SHOCK PASSED THROUGH THE OAR UP INTO HIS ARM HE WAS DRAGGING SOMETHING HEAVY AND COULD NOT BRING THE OAR FORWARD AND THEN HE PULLED THE HEAD OF A PIKE UP ABOVE THE WATER AT THE SAME MOMENT
6065-109178-0026 THE FISH DROPPED AND THE OAR WAS FREE BUT GRIM WAS WISER AFTER THAT AS THE YEARS PASSED SHE DEVELOPED INTO A POWERFUL RULER AND INCREASINGLY FELT HERSELF TO BE THE DIVINELY FAVOURED INMATE OF THE LAKE
6065-109178-0027 SHE WAS NOT ONE OF THE RABBLE SHE HUNTED LARGE AND SMALL AND LORDED IT OVER THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAKE AS FAR AS SHE POSSIBLY COULD BY MORE FREQUENT AND LONGER EXPEDITIONS
6065-109178-0028 SHE INCREASED HER KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAKE AND LEARNED THE ROUTES TO ALL THE REEFS CREEKS AND BANKS AND SHE ASCERTAINED THAT IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS HER WORLD WAS IMMENSE IT WAS ONLY THE SURFACE THAT SHE SHUNNED
6065-109178-0029 AND THE DEEPEST DEPTHS FOR THERE WERE GREAT CRAYFISH TO WHOM THE CREATOR HAD BEEN SO GOOD
6065-109178-0030 AT THE END OF A PAIR OF LONG JOINTED CLAWS AND THERE TOO LIVED OA THE DREADED FISH MONSTER GRIM'S TERRITORY LAY HALF WAY BETWEEN THESE
6065-109178-0031 IN THE PURE LIGHT OF EARLY DAWN WHEN THE NIGHT FLIES AND MOTHS DROWSY AND INTOXICATED WITH THEIR NOCTURNAL VISITS TO THE FLOWERS FELL BY HUNDREDS INTO THE WATER ON THEIR WAY HOME
6065-109178-0032 WHEN THE SWALLOWS RELIEVED THE BATS AND THE WHIRLIGIGS IN THE SHELTERED NOOKS BEGAN THEIR NOISELESS SCURRYING OVER THE WATER BENEATH WHICH THE WATER PLANTS WERE BEGINNING TO APPEAR IN GREEN YELLOW
6065-109178-0033 WHEN THE DAY DAWNED DOWN WHERE GRIM HAD HER HOME AND THE WIDE SURFACE ABOVE HER WAS FILLED WITH LIGHT AND RADIANCE THEN SHE HUNTED MOST KEENLY AND FELT MOST VORACIOUS AND THEN THERE WAS TERROR IN HER SPLASH AND SNAP
6065-109178-0034 ONE MORNING EARLY A BREEZE IS RUFFLING THE SURFACE OF THE LAKE AND WINDING WHITE FOAMED CURRENTS ARE EATING THEIR WAY OUT AMONG BLACK SHALLOWS THE TERNS ARE DIVING DOWN AFTER SMALL FISH
6065-109178-0035 AND ALONG THE RUSH BORDERED BANKS THE RISING SUN IS TREADING THE WATER GRIM IS ABROAD PUSHING HERSELF FORWARD LIKE A SHADOW ALONG THE BOTTOM HER CUNNING CROCODILE EYES ARE TURNED UP
6065-109178-0036 SO THAT THEY PROJECT FROM HER HEAD A NUMBER OF ROACH ARE THRONGING ABOUT A CLUMP OF RUSHES EXAMINING LEAVES AND STALKS JUST AS LONG TAILED TITS SEARCH TREE TOPS AND BARK
6065-109178-0037 THEY ARE INSIDE IT AND OUTSIDE IT SUCKING UP THE WATER SNAILS AND INSECTS GRIM STOPS WITH A JERK SHE SCARCELY MOVES HER VENTRAL FINS AND BREATHES VERY GENTLY AT EACH BREATH
6065-109178-0038 SHE CAUTIOUSLY OPENS HER MOUTH AND DRAWS BACK HER TONGUE THUS FILLING THE SPIKED BARREL WITH WATER THEN SHE CAREFULLY CLOSES IT AGAIN SHOOTS HER TONGUE FORWARD AND EMITS THE WATER THROUGH HER GILLS
6065-109178-0039 THE LITTLE FISH GAMBOL UNWITTINGLY CLOSE TO HER MOUTH HER UPTURNED EYES LOOK STILL HIGHER AND SEE THE GLEAM OF THEIR WHITE SCALED BELLIES NOW SHE IS READY TO SPRING
6065-109178-0040 THERE IS JUST A MOVEMENT OF THE EXTREME TIP OF THE TAIL ONLY THE SHIFTING SHADOW LINES THAT THE REEDS CAST OVER HER BODY INDICATE THAT SHE IS MOVING FORWARD SHE PEERS ABOUT CONTINUALLY PEEVISHLY
6065-109178-0041 ONLY ONE THING TROUBLES HER SHE CAN NEVER DECIDE WHICH FISH OUT OF THE SWARMING MULTITUDE SHE WILL TAKE TRUE SHE HAS MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF THE WAY TO DIRECT HER ATTACK AS THE ARDENT HUNTER HIS AIM
6065-109178-0042 BUT THE ROACH ARE NIMBLE AND SHE SELDOM GETS MORE THAN ONE AT A STROKE SLOWLY AND IMPERCEPTIBLY SHE RISES WHILE ALL THE FIN TIPS WAG AND WAVE IN LINGERING ENJOYMENT
6065-109178-0043 SUDDENLY A LITTLE SCARLET ROACH EYE DISCOVERS HER BLACK BACK WHICH UP TO THE PRESENT HAD LOOKED JUST LIKE PART OF THE BOTTOM AND THEY FLY AWAY FROM HER IN A PANIC OF TERROR IN ONE MOMENT THE RUSHY MARGIN IS EMPTY
6065-109178-0044 AN ACCIDENT THAT MAY HAPPEN EVEN TO THE BEST OF US AND GRIM HAS TO MOVE ON TO FRESH HUNTING GROUNDS AMONG THE FLOATING FORESTS OF GREEN FEATHER FOIL GO BIG BROAD SCALED BREAM
6065-109178-0045 THEY FOLLOW CLOSE IN ONE ANOTHER'S WAKE AND LIE ON THE SURFACE LETTING THE SUNLIGHT PLAY UPON THEIR GOLDEN SCALES THEIR FAT BELLIES WITH THE LOBSTER RED FINS AND THEIR LARGE COD LIKE MOUTHS GIVE AN IMPRESSION OF SIMPLENESS
6065-109178-0046 YET THEY ARE CUNNING ENOUGH AND VERY CAUTIOUS IN ALL THEIR BEHAVIOUR SEVERAL OF THEM ARE COVERED WITH CUTS AND WOUNDS ON THE BACK AND SIDES AND IT IS EVIDENT THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH A PIKE'S MOUTH
6065-109178-0047 THE BODY OF ONE OF THEM IS STILL BLOODY AND THREADS OF FLESH AND TORN SCALES MAKE IT LOOK QUITE WOOLLY AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE WATER THEY COME FROM DEEP DOWN AT THE BOTTOM
6065-109178-0048 AND SHINE WITH MUD AND SLIME AND WATER MOSS THEY WHISK ALONG WITH MUCH MOVEMENT AND MANY STROKES OF THE TAIL REEDS AND RUSHES SWING AND SWAY AS THEY STOP FOR A MOMENT TO RUB THEMSELVES AGAINST THEM
6065-109178-0049 AS THEY PASS THROUGH THE OPEN WATER BETWEEN THE MASSES OF VEGETATION WHERE THE SUN SUDDENLY SHINES UPON THEIR AMBER SCALES GRIM HASTILY CONCEALS HERSELF IN THE FOREST OF WEED
6065-109178-0050 THE PLIANT WATER PLANTS WITH THEIR LONG STALKS ACCOMMODATE THEMSELVES TO THE CURRENT HANGING WESTWARDS FOR AN HOUR ONLY TO TURN JUST AS UNRESISTINGLY THE OPPOSITE WAY THE NEXT
6065-109178-0051 STIFF COLLARS OF LEAVES LIKE LIFE BELTS HOLD UP THE NAKED STALKS AND FORM A CLOSE FLICKERING THICKET ABOUT THE LURKING LYNX WITHOUT THE SLIME ON HER BODY SHE WOULD NEVER GET THROUGH
6065-109178-0052 WITH A THICK GREENISH JUICY RIM TO THE CORNERS OF THEIR FAT MOUTHS HER PURPOSE STRENGTHENS HER POWERS ARE DOUBLED BUT SHE IS ABLE TO RESTRAIN HERSELF THE MOMENT HAS NOT YET COME
6065-109178-0053 NOT UNTIL THE LAST WATER COW IS STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER DOES SHE REVEAL HERSELF AND THE WATER FLASHES AND BUBBLES AS GRIM TWISTS AND TURNS IN HER EFFORTS TO COME UP WITH HER PREY
6065-109178-0054 THE FLANK ATTACK HOWEVER DOES NOT COME ALTOGETHER AS A SURPRISE TO THE COW IT HAS BEEN PREPARED FOR IT IN THIS NARROW PASSAGE AND THEREFORE KEPT CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM
6065-109178-0055 AS A STONE BORES ITS WAY INTO THE GROUND SO DOES IT PLUNGE INTO THE MUD STIRRING UP THE WATER AND DIGGING ITSELF IN SO THAT GRIM GETS ONLY MUD AND GRAINS OF SAND BETWEEN HER TEETH
6065-109178-0056 ANOTHER ACCIDENT WHICH ONLY SHARPENED HER APPETITE AND MADE HER UNGOVERNABLY FIERCE AND JUST THEN A LITTLE ROACH SWAM PAST GRIM STARTED
6065-109178-0057 HER EMBARRASSMENT AT HER FAILURE ALMOST DISAPPEARED AND SHE INVOLUNTARILY STIFFENED AS SHE STOOD SHE COULD SEE WITH HALF AN EYE THAT THE LITTLE ROACH WHICH WAS LIMPING ALONG WITHOUT ANY FROLICSOME JUMPS AND TWISTS
6065-109178-0058 WOULD BE AN EASY PREY WHAT LUCK ROACH WERE GENERALLY LIVELY LITTLE FISH AND NOT EASILY GOT HOLD OF
6065-109178-0059 SHE HAD TO USE ALL HER POWERS AND UNFOLD ALL HER ENERGY IN ORDER TO CATCH TWO OR THREE
6065-109178-0060 IT WAS ONLY IN MAY WHEN THEY LAY IN BUNDLES AMONG THE RUSHES AMOROUSLY FLICKING THEIR TAILS THAT SHE HAD HER FILL OF THEM TAKING AS MANY AS A SCORE IN THE DAY NOW ONLY PATIENCE A LITTLE MORE TIME TO WAIT
6065-109178-0061 FOR THIS TIME SHE WOULD MAKE SURE OF HER FISH JUST THEN THERE IS A MOVEMENT IN ONE OF THE CLUMPS OF WEED THE DUSKY HUED PERCH WITH THE HIGH BACK FORESTALLS HER RIGHT BEFORE HER NOSE
6065-109178-0062 HE DARTS LIKE AN ARROW AFTER THE FUGITIVE BUT HESITATES AT THE VERY MOMENT OF STRIKING STOPS AND SNIFFS OH SO HE DAREN'T HE WANTS TO HAVE THE WHOLE COMPANY WITH HIM
6065-109178-0063 AND HER STIFF TONGUE QUIVERS IN HER MOUTH AS WITH WIDELY OPENED JAWS SHE SPRINGS UPON HER PREY THE ROACH IS GOOD ENOUGH
6065-109178-0064 WITH SLAPS OF ITS LITTLE TAIL AND YET IT HAS AN INEXPLICABLE STRENGTH LIKE THAT OF A LITTLE PEARLY FISH THAT SHE DIMLY REMEMBERS SHE GROWS ANGRY
6065-109178-0065 IS AN INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE FISH LIKE THIS GOING TO RESIST HER WILL THE SILLY LITTLE THING IS READY TO GO ANY WAY BUT THE ONE SHE WANTS IT TO GO SHE CAN HARDLY GET FROM ONE THICKET OF WEEDS TO THE OTHER
6065-109178-0066 SHE BECOMES SO ANGRY THAT SHE FEELS THE BLOOD BURNING IN THE BACK OF HER NECK AND WITH A SUDDEN VIGOROUS EFFORT SHE GIVES THE ROACH A VIOLENT TUG THAT HELPS THE FISH BECOMES MANAGEABLE
6065-109178-0067 ITS STRENGTH VANISHES SHE IS TRIUMPHANT YES SHE KNEW OF COURSE HOW IT WOULD BE GRIM HAD BEEN FORTUNATE IN HER MISADVENTURE TRUE
6065-109178-0068 IT WAS A MAN ROACH THAT SHE HAD BITTEN INTO BUT SHE HAD FORTUNATELY BROKEN THE LINE AND NOW WENT OFF WITH A LONG TRACE DRAGGING AFTER HER SHE HAD SWALLOWED THE BAIT
6065-109178-0069 WAS THAT IN DOING SO SHE HAD GOT A LONG THORNY WATER PLANT FIXED TO HER UPPER LIP THEY WERE THE BARBS OF THE TRIPLE HOOK THAT SHE TOOK FOR THORNS AT THAT MOMENT
6065-109178-0070 SHE SEES ANOTHER LITTLE ROACH SHINING IT IS JUST AS LANGUID AS THE PREVIOUS ONE AND MAKES THE SAME TEMPTING IMPRESSION INSTANTLY SHE MAKES A DASH AT IT THE SAME COMEDY WAS GONE THROUGH
6065-109178-0071 THE SAME INCOMPREHENSIBLE STRENGTH IN A PUNY ROACH AND THE SAME WORK TO GET THE REFRACTORY FISH INTO HER POWER WELL SHE MANAGED IT AT LAST AT LAST SHE HAD HER MOUTHFUL
6065-109178-0072 THIS ONE SHE SWALLOWED TOO BUT ONCE MORE SHE HAD TO SPIT OUT SOMETHING SHARP AND PRICKLY THAT HUNG TO HER UPPER LIP ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
6065-109178-0073 IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE GRIM MANAGED TO WEAR AWAY THE TWO TRIPLE HOOKS FROM THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH AND IN THE MEANTIME SHE SWAM ABOUT WITH THE RUSTY THINGS LIKE AN EXTRA SET OF MONSTER EYE TEETH STICKING OUT OF HER MOUTH
6065-109178-0074 THE PIECES OF LINE THAT TRAILED BEHIND HER OFTEN CAUGHT IN THINGS AND CHAINED HER IN AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE MANNER TO REEDS AND RUSHES
6065-109178-0075 AND A LITTLE LATER THE OTHER AND A HARD GRISTLY LEATHER LIKE SKIN FORMED WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SHE GAINED SOME EXPERIENCE FROM THIS INCIDENT HENCEFORWARD SHE REGARDED SOLITARY
6065-109178-0076 SICKLY LOOKING ROACH WITH KEEN SUSPICION SHE WOULD STILL TAKE WITH CONFIDENT VORACITY LARGE ROACH AND SMALL BUT SHE VERY RELUCTANTLY TOOK A HALTING LANGUID FISH LIKE THOSE THAT HAD PRICKED HER SO HORRIBLY THAT MORNING
6065-109178-0077 THEIR DROOPING FINS AND HEAVY WRIGGLING FLIGHT HAD FIXED THEMSELVES CLEARLY IN HER MIND'S EYE HER PEACEFUL YOUTH IN WHICH SHE HAD ONLY HAD THE HERON AND THE CRAYFISH AND HER OWN KIND TO FIGHT WITH
6065-109178-0078 HAD LONG SINCE PASSED AND HENCEFORTH SHE WAS TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF THE ANGLER'S IMPLEMENTS BUT THE OLD SPORTSMAN WHOSE TACKLE WAS WEARING OUT HAD TO OVERHAUL AND RENEW HIS STOCK
6065-109178-0079 IT IRRITATED HIM BEYOND ENDURANCE AND FOR A LONG TIME HE FELT ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FROM THE RESISTANCE IT HAD OFFERED HE FELT QUITE CONVINCED THAT THE PIKE HE HAD LOST WAS AT LEAST WORTH A BRONZE MEDAL
