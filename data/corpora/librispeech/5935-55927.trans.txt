5935-55927-0000 CHAPTER SIX SHIPS THE CARGO SLAVE AND THE OCEAN GREYHOUND ARE ALREADY DIFFERENTIATED BY MARKED CHARACTERISTICS AND IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF VESSELS WILL BECOME MUCH ACCENTUATED
5935-55927-0001 THE OBJECT AIMED AT BY THE OWNERS OF CARGO BOATS WILL BE TO SECURE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ECONOMY OF WORKING COMBINED WITH A MODERATELY GOOD RATE OF SPEED SUCH AS MAY ENSURE SHIPPERS AGAINST HAVING TO STAND OUT OF THEIR CAPITAL LOCKED UP IN THE CARGO FOR TOO LONG A PERIOD
5935-55927-0002 AND THE POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF NATURAL SOURCES OF ENERGY WILL BE KEENLY SCRUTINISED WITH A VIEW TO TURNING ANY FEASIBLE PLAN TO ADVANTAGE THE SAILING SHIP AND THE ECONOMIC AND CONSTRUCTIVE LINES UPON WHICH IT IS BUILT AND WORKED
5935-55927-0003 WILL BE CAREFULLY OVERHAULED WITH A VIEW TO FINDING HOW ITS DEFICIENCIES MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED AND ITS GOOD POINTS TURNED TO ACCOUNT ONE RESULT OF THIS RENEWED ATTENTION WILL BE TO CONFIRM
5935-55927-0004 EVEN ON THE SAILER IF IT IS TO HOLD ITS OWN AGAINST STEAM FOR MAILS AND PASSENGERS ON THE OTHER HAND STEAM MUST MORE AND MORE DECIDEDLY ASSERT ITS SUPREMACY
5935-55927-0005 YET THE MAIL PACKET OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM PACKETS WHICH HAVE MADE THE RUNNING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE NINETEENTH SHE WILL CARRY LITTLE OR NO CARGO EXCEPTING SPECIE AND GOODS OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH VALUE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR WEIGHT AND BULK
5935-55927-0006 NEARLY ALL HER BELOW DECK CAPACITY INDEED WILL BE FILLED WITH MACHINERY AND FUEL SHE WILL BE IN OTHER RESPECTS MORE LIKE A FLOATING HOTEL THAN THE OLD IDEAL OF A SHIP HER CELLARS SO TO SPEAK BEING CRAMMED WITH COAL
5935-55927-0007 AND HER UPPER STORIES FITTED LUXURIOUSLY FOR SITTING AND BED ROOMS AND BRILLIANT WITH THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BUT IN SIZE SHE WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE ANY LARGER THAN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TYPE OF MAIL STEAMER INDEED THE PROBABILITY IS THAT
5935-55927-0008 ON THE AVERAGE THE TWENTIETH CENTURY MAIL PACKETS WILL BE SMALLER BEING BUILT FOR SPEED RATHER THAN FOR MAGNIFICENCE OR CARRYING CAPACITY THE TURBINE ENGINE WILL BE THE MAIN FACTOR IN WORKING THE APPROACHING REVOLUTION IN MAIL STEAMER CONSTRUCTION
5935-55927-0009 THE SPECIAL REASON FOR THIS WILL CONSIST IN THE FACT THAT ONLY BY ITS ADOPTION CAN THE CONDITIONS MENTIONED ABOVE BE FULFILLED WITH THE ORDINARY RECIPROCATING TYPE OF MARINE STEAM MACHINERY IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PLACE IN A STEAMER OF MODERATE TONNAGE
5935-55927-0010 ENGINES OF A SIZE SUITABLE TO ENABLE IT TO ATTAIN A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED BECAUSE THE STRAIN AND VIBRATION OF THE GIGANTIC STEEL ARMS PULLING AND PUSHING THE HUGE CRANKS TO TURN THE SHAFTING WOULD KNOCK THE HULL TO PIECES IN A VERY SHORT TIME
5935-55927-0011 FOR THIS VERY REASON IN FACT THE MARINE ARCHITECT AND ENGINEER HAVE HITHERTO URGED WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE OF ARGUMENT THAT HIGH SPEED AND LARGE TONNAGE MUST GO CONCOMITANTLY
5935-55927-0012 PRACTICALLY ONLY A BIG STEAMER WITH THE OLD TYPE OF MARINE ENGINE COULD BE A VERY FAST ONE AND FOR OCEAN TRAFFIC AT ANY RATE A SMALLER VESSEL MUST BE REGARDED AS OUT OF THE RUNNING
5935-55927-0013 VERY LARGE TONNAGE BEING THUS MADE A PRIME NECESSITY IT FOLLOWED THAT THE SPACE PROVIDED MUST BE UTILISED AND THIS NEED HAS TENDED TO PERPETUATE THE COMBINATION OF MAIL AND PASSENGER TRAFFIC WITH CARGO CARRYING
5935-55927-0014 THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE REVOLUTION WAS TAKEN MANY YEARS AGO WHEN THE SCREW PROPELLER WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE PADDLE WHEEL THE LATTER MEANS OF PROPULSION CAUSED SHOCK AND VIBRATION NOT ONLY OWING TO THE THRUSTS OF THE PISTON ROD FROM THE STEAM ENGINE ITSELF
5935-55927-0015 A PROPELLER WHICH WAS ENTIRELY SUNK IN THE WATER AND THEREFORE EXERCISED ITS FORCE NOT IN SHOCKS BUT IN GENTLE CONSTANT PRESSURE UPON THE FLUID AROUND IT SUCH AS THE WINDMILL IS FOR WIND AND THE TURBINE WATER WHEEL FOR WATER WAS THE SCREW PROPELLER
5935-55927-0016 ALTHOUGH ADAPTED NOT AS A GENERATOR BUT AS AN APPLICATION OF POWER HAVING MADE THE WORK AND STRESS CONTINUOUS THE NEXT THING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED WAS TO EFFECT A SIMILAR REFORM IN THE ENGINES SUPPLYING THE POWER
5935-55927-0017 THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE TURBINE STEAM ENGINE BY CAUSING THE STEAM TO PLAY IN STRONG JETS CONTINUOUSLY AND STEADILY UPON VANES WHICH FORM VIRTUALLY A NUMBER OF SMALL WINDMILLS
5935-55927-0018 THUS WHILE THE SCREW OUTSIDE OF THE HULL IS APPLYING THE FORCE CONTINUOUSLY THE STEAM IN THE INSIDE IS DRIVING THE SHAFTING WITH EQUAL EVENNESS AND REGULARITY THE STEAM TURBINE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BY ANY MEANS REACHED FINALITY IN ITS FORM
5935-55927-0019 SUCH QUESTIONS AS THE ANGLE OF IMPACT WHICH THE JET SHOULD MAKE WITH THE SURFACE OF THE VANE AND THE SIZE OF THE ORIFICE THROUGH WHICH THE STEAM SHOULD BE EJECTED BEING STILL DEBATABLE POINTS BUT ON ONE MATTER THERE IS HARDLY ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT
5935-55927-0020 AND THAT IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO SECURE THE BENEFIT OF THE EXPANSIVE POWER OF STEAM IS TO PERMIT IT TO ESCAPE FROM A PIPE HAVING A LONG SERIES OF ORIFICES AND TO IMPINGE UPON A CORRESPONDINGLY NUMEROUS SERIES OF VANES OR PERHAPS
5935-55927-0021 UPON A NUMBER OF VANES ARRANGED SO THAT EACH ONE IS LONG ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THE IMPACT OF MANY JETS HITHERTO THE STEAM SUPPLY PIPE EMITTING THE JET HAS BEEN PLACED OUTSIDE OF THE CIRCLE OF THE WHEEL
5935-55927-0022 BUT THE FUTURE FORM SEEMS LIKELY TO BE ONE IN WHICH THE AXIS OF THE WHEEL IS ITSELF THE PIPE WHICH CONTAINS THE STEAM BUT WHICH PERMITS IT TO ESCAPE OUTWARDS TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE WHEEL THE LATTER IS IN THIS FORM OF TURBINE
5935-55927-0023 MADE IN THE SHAPE OF A PADDLE WHEEL OF VERY SMALL CIRCUMFERENCE BUT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH THE PADDLES BEING SET AT SUCH AN INCLINATION AS TO OBTAIN THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ROTATIVE IMPULSE FROM THE OUTWARD RUSHING STEAM
5935-55927-0024 THE PIPE MUST BE TURNED TRUE AT INTERVALS TO ENABLE IT TO CARRY A NUMBER OF DIMINUTIVE WHEELS UPON WHICH THESE LONG VANES ARE MOUNTED AND A VERY STRONG CONNECTION MUST BE MADE BETWEEN THESE WHEELS AND THE SHAFT OF THE SCREW
5935-55927-0025 BUT TO THE EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY WITH WHICH THE SHAFT ROTATES THE TWIN SCREW WITH WHICH THE BEST AND SAFEST OF MODERN STEAM SHIPS ARE ALL FITTED WILL SOON DEVELOP INTO WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE TWIN STERN
5935-55927-0026 EACH SCREW REQUIRES A SEPARATE SET OF ENGINES AND THE MAIN OBJECT OF THE DUPLICATION IS TO LESSEN THE RISK OF THE VESSEL BEING LEFT HELPLESS IN CASE OF ACCIDENT TO ONE OR OTHER THE ADVISABILITY OF PLACING EACH ENGINE AND SHAFTING IN A SEPARATE WATER TIGHT COMPARTMENT
5935-55927-0027 IT WILL BE FOUND BEST TO BUILD OUT A STEEL FRAMEWORK FROM EACH SIDE OF THE STERN FOR HOLDING THE BEARINGS OF EACH SCREW IN CONNECTION WITH THE TWIN WATER TIGHT COMPARTMENTS HOLDING THE SHAFTING AND THUS WILL BE EVOLVED WHAT WILL PRACTICALLY REPRESENT A TWIN OR DOUBLE STERN
5935-55927-0028 IN THE CASE OF THE TURBINE STEAMER SEVERAL OF THE FORMS OF SCREW WHICH WERE FIRST PROPOSED WHEN THAT TYPE OF PROPELLER WAS INVENTED WILL AGAIN COME UP FOR EXAMINATION NOTABLY THE ARCHIMEDEAN SCREW WOUND ROUND A FAIRLY LONG PIECE OF SHAFTING
5935-55927-0029 THE LARGER THE CIRCULAR AREA OF THIS SCREW IS THE LESS WILL BE THE RISK OF SMASHING THE WATER OR OF LOSING HOLD OF IT ENTIRELY IN ROUGH WEATHER
5935-55927-0030 WITH TWIN SCREWS OF THE LARGE ARCHIMEDEAN TYPE THE PROPELLING APPARATUS OF A TURBINE STEAMER WILL IF THE SCREWS ARE LEFT OPEN
5935-55927-0031 IN THIS WAY THERE IS EVOLVED A KIND OF COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO PRINCIPLES OF MARINE PROPULSION BY A SCREW AND BY A JET OF WATER THROWN TO STERNWARD THE WATER JET IS ALREADY VERY SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED FOR THE PROPULSION OF STEAM LIFEBOATS IN WHICH
5935-55927-0032 OWING TO THE DANGER OF FOULING THE LIFE SAVING AND OTHER TACKLE AN OPEN SCREW IS OBJECTIONABLE THE FINAL EXTERMINATION OF THE SAILING SHIP IS POPULARLY EXPECTED AS ONE OF THE FIRST DEVELOPMENTS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IN MARITIME TRAFFIC
5935-55927-0033 STEAM WHICH FOR OVERSEA TRADE MADE ITS ENTRANCE CAUTIOUSLY IN THE SHAPE OF A MERE AUXILIARY TO SAIL POWER HAD TAKEN UP A MUCH MORE SELF ASSERTIVE POSITION LONG BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
5935-55927-0034 AND HAS DRIVEN ITS FORMER ALLY ALMOST OUT OF THE FIELD IN LARGE DEPARTMENTS OF THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY YET A CURIOUS AND INTERESTING COUNTER MOVEMENT IS NOW TAKING PLACE ON THE PACIFIC COAST OF AMERICA
5935-55927-0035 AS WELL AS AMONG THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS AND IN SEVERAL OTHER PLACES WHERE COAL IS EXCEPTIONALLY DEAR TRADING SCHOONERS AND BARQUES USED IN THESE LOCALITIES ARE OFTEN FITTED WITH PETROLEUM OIL ENGINES WHICH ENABLE THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR VOYAGES DURING CALM
5935-55927-0036 HAD THE EFFECT OF ENABLING SHIPPERS TO REALISE UPON THE GOODS CARRIED MORE SPEEDILY THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM OF SAIL POWER ALONE IT IS ALREADY FOUND THAT IN THE MATTER OF ECONOMY OF WORKING INCLUDING INTEREST ON COST OF VESSEL AND CARGO
5935-55927-0037 BUT THE RATE OF SPEED WHICH THE BEST TYPES OF MARINE ENGINES IMPART TO THIS KIND OF VESSEL IS STRICTLY LIMITED OWING TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THE ENORMOUS INCREASE OF FUEL CONSUMPTION AFTER PASSING THE TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILE GRADE
5935-55927-0038 FOR OCEAN GREYHOUNDS CARRYING MAILS AND PASSENGERS THE PRIME NECESSITY OF HIGH SPEED HAS TO A LARGE EXTENT OBLITERATED ANY SUCH SEPARATING LINE BETWEEN WASTE AND ECONOMY IT IS HOWEVER A MISTAKE TO IMAGINE THAT THE CARGO STEAMER OF THE FUTURE
5935-55927-0039 WILL BE IN ANY SENSE A REPLICA OF THE MAIL BOAT OF TO DAY THE OPPOSITION PRESENTED BY THE WATER TO THE PASSAGE OF A VESSEL INCREASES BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS AS SOON AS THE RATE NOW ADOPTED BY THE CARGO STEAMER IS PASSED
