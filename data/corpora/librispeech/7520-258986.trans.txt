7520-258986-0000 LARGE PRODUCTION AND MONOPOLY POWER CAPITAL IN THE SENSE OF VALUABLE AGENTS
7520-258986-0001 AND EVERY OWNER FROM THE SMALL SHOP KEEPER TO THE WEALTHIEST BONDHOLDER IS A CAPITALIST IN POPULAR DISCUSSION HOWEVER THE WORD FREQUENTLY IMPLIES GREAT WEALTH IN A SINGLE HAND
7520-258986-0002 THOUGH THIS WEALTH MAY BE INVESTED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL INDUSTRIES LARGE PRODUCTION IS THE CONCENTRATION OF CAPITAL INTO LARGE UNITS OF INDUSTRY THE CAPITAL MAY BE THE SAME AS BEFORE THE OWNERSHIP MAY OR MAY NOT BE WIDELY DIFFUSED
7520-258986-0003 BUT THE CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT ARE UNIFIED LARGE FACTORIES MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE MONOPOLY POWER AS FACTORIES GROW IN SIZE COMPETITION AMONG THEM OFTEN BECOMES MORE NOT LESS COMPLETE AND SEVERE ON THE CONTRARY
7520-258986-0004 MONOPOLY AS BEFORE DEFINED MAY EXIST WHERE THE INDUSTRY IS SMALL AS THE WATERWORKS IN A SMALL TOWN OR A SMALL FACTORY FOR MAKING PATENTED ARTICLES IN PERIODS OF DEPRESSION
7520-258986-0005 A BUSINESS WITH A CAPITAL OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MAY GO ON AND PROSPER WHILE ONE WITH MILLIONS MAY BE FORCED INTO BANKRUPTCY THESE THREE IDEAS GREAT INDIVIDUAL WEALTH LARGE INDUSTRY
7520-258986-0006 OVER TWO THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE ON THE GLOBE ARE STILL IN THE FIRST INDUSTRIAL STAGE ONE BILLION PEOPLE USE ONLY TOOLS AND HAVE NO BETTER SOURCE AND MEANS OF POWER THAN DOMESTIC ANIMALS THIS IS TRUE IN THE MOST OF ASIA AND AFRICA
7520-258986-0007 AND IN MANY PORTIONS OF NORTH AMERICA ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN THE STAGE OF SIMPLE MACHINES AND SMALL FACTORIES THESE ARE FOUND IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN EUROPE SMALL PORTIONS OF SOUTH AMERICA SOME PARTS EVEN OF THE UNITED STATES
7520-258986-0008 IN THIS STAGE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MANUFACTURING POWER IN THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPLY MUCH MORE THAN ITS OWN NEEDS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE HAVE REACHED THE THIRD AND HIGHEST INDUSTRIAL PLANE
7520-258986-0009 WHERE THE HIGHEST MECHANICAL DEVICES ARE EMPLOYED AND INDUSTRY BECOMES HIGHLY SPECIALIZED THESE DIFFERENCES ARE BROADLY STATED THERE ARE CONTRASTS WITHIN EVERY NATION THREE HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE IN THE ALLEGHANIES
7520-258986-0010 PEOPLE STILL CAN BE FOUND SPINNING AND WEAVING AND WEARING HOMESPUN AS IN COLONIAL DAYS
7520-258986-0011 ON FARMS AND IN HOMES WHERE THE GREATER PART OF THE THINGS USED WERE PRODUCED IN THE FAMILY WAS STILL THE TYPICAL ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES THE EARLY FACTORIES GROWING OUT OF THE HOUSEHOLD INDUSTRY WERE SMALL
7520-258986-0012 A FAMILY SPECIALIZED IN PRODUCING CLOTH AND EXCHANGED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS SO WITH SHOES CANDLES SOAP CANNED GOODS CURED MEATS ET CETERA SINCE THAT TIME TWO COUNTER FORCES HAVE BEEN AT WORK
7520-258986-0013 TO AFFECT THE RATIO OF MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS TO POPULATION THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS HAS BEEN INCREASED BY SPECIALIZATION OF FARMING WHICH HAS CALLED FOR MANY INDUSTRIES TO PRODUCE THE THINGS ONCE MADE ON FARMS AND BY INCREASING WEALTH AND INVENTION
7520-258986-0014 WHICH HAS MADE POSSIBLE MANY SMALL INDUSTRIES SUPPLYING THINGS BEFORE ALMOST UNKNOWN THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS HAS BEEN DIMINISHED AS THE STAPLE PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE TRANSPORTED HAVE COME TO BE MADE IN LARGER FACTORIES
7520-258986-0015 THE RESULTANT OF THESE MOVEMENTS DURING THE THIRTY YEARS ENDING IN NINETEEN HUNDRED IS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING THE RATIO OF FACTORIES WITH AN OUTPUT WORTH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO POPULATION HAS SOMEWHAT INCREASED
7520-258986-0016 IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND ESTABLISHMENTS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND AND IN NINETEEN HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND A RATIO TO POPULATION OF ONE
7520-258986-0017 TO ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR RESPECTIVELY THE LAST DATE WAS ONE OF GREAT INDUSTRIAL PROSPERITY AND DOUBTLESS MANY EPHEMERAL ENTERPRISES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO EXISTENCE
7520-258986-0018 THUS GIVING A SOMEWHAT ABNORMAL RESULT MOREOVER THERE HAS BEEN A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF THINGS MADE IN FACTORIES WHICH WERE FORMERLY MADE IN THE HOMES AND WHICH THEN DID NOT APPEAR AT ALL
7520-258986-0019 THE UNIT OF INDUSTRY IS GROWING FACTORIES IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NUMBERING NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX
7520-258986-0020 NINE HUNDRED AND FIVE IN NINETEEN HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND AND FIFTY FIVE THE LATER INCREASE BEING DUE TO THE FACT THAT MANY NEW FACTORIES IN THE SOUTH HAVE BEEN STARTED IN THE LAST DECADE THE POPULATION MEANTIME DOUBLED
7520-258986-0021 THIS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVENTY YEARS THERE BEING ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF MILLS IN NINETEEN HUNDRED AS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THOUGH POPULATION HAD MULTIPLIED SIX FOLD IRON AND STEEL MILLS NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
7520-258986-0022 ONE THOUSAND IN EIGHTEEN NINETY AND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE IN NINETEEN HUNDRED IN INDUSTRIES HAVING LOCAL MARKETS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR MATERIALS THE CHANGE HAS BEEN LESS RAPID THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND GRIST MILLS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
7520-258986-0023 EIGHTEEN THOUSAND IN EIGHTEEN NINETY AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IN NINETEEN HUNDRED A CHANGE OF RATIO FROM TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND POPULATION PER GRIST MILL THERE WERE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND SAWMILLS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
7520-258986-0024 TWENTY TWO THOUSAND IN EIGHTEEN NINETY AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND IN NINETEEN HUNDRED A CHANGE FROM ABOUT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PERSONS PER SAWMILL
7520-258986-0025 BUT WHILE THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS IN THESE STAPLE INDUSTRIES WAS DECREASING THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES PER ESTABLISHMENT IN MOST CASES WAS INCREASING THE AVERAGE IN ALL INDUSTRIES IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY WAS EIGHT IN EIGHTEEN NINETY TWELVE IN NINETEEN HUNDRED
7520-258986-0026 TEN AND FOUR TENTHS IN COTTON MILLS IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THE AVERAGE WAS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR IN EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR IN NINETEEN HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN
7520-258986-0027 THE GRIST MILLS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY HAD TWO AND FOUR TENTHS PERSONS PER ESTABLISHMENT IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE AND FOUR TENTHS THE SAWMILLS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
7520-258986-0028 AND IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT THE CENSUS FIGURES ON THIS SUBJECT ARE ONLY APPROXIMATELY CORRECT WE ARE TOLD THAT IN COTTON MILLS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE AVERAGE CAPITAL INVESTED WAS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY
7520-258986-0029 NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN NINETEEN HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IT IS EASY TO OBSERVE THE LARGE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL IN FLOURING MILLS SINCE THE NEW PROCESSES CAME INTO USE
7520-258986-0030 THE AVERAGE CAPITAL OF ALL INDUSTRIES DOES NOT GROW AS IN THE STAPLE ONES
7520-258986-0031 SHOWING THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS AND OF EMPLOYEES MANY DISCREPANCIES APPEAR IN THE DATA REGARDING THIS MOVEMENT GIVEN BY DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES AS THERE IS NO GENERALLY ACCEPTED RULE BY WHICH TO DETERMINE THE SELECTION
7520-258986-0032 OF THE COMPANIES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE LISTS AND AS THE CONDITIONS ARE CHANGING FROM DAY TO DAY
7520-258986-0033 REGARDING THE INDUSTRIAL TRUSTS
7520-258986-0034 AND GAS TRUSTS ORGANIZED IN THE UNITED STATES BETWEEN EIGHTEEN SIXTY AND EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE NOT INCLUDING COMBINATIONS IN SUCH BUSINESSES AS BANKING SHIPPING RAILROAD TRANSPORTATION ET CETERA
7520-258986-0035 THE FIGURES REFER TO THE REORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION OF INDUSTRIES INTO LARGER UNITS SOME OF WHICH HAVE MUCH
7520-258986-0036 THE SAME AUTHORITY IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LIST CLASSIFIES IN SIX GROUPS ALL SO CALLED TRUSTS OF THE UNITED STATES
7520-258986-0037 A GREAT TECHNICAL ADVANTAGE OF LARGE PRODUCTION IS THE BETTER AND FULLER USE OF MACHINERY A LARGE FACTORY WITH A LARGE OUTPUT CAN KEEP A SPECIAL MACHINE ADJUSTED FOR EACH PATTERN AND PROCESS
7520-258986-0038 WHEREAS IN A SMALL FACTORY MUCH TIME AND ENERGY ARE WASTED IN ADJUSTING ONE MACHINE FOR VARIOUS PROCESSES THE MACHINERY IN A LARGE FACTORY IS THUS MORE FULLY UTILIZED
7520-258986-0039 COMPARE THE MACHINERY USED IN A LARGE AX FACTORY WITH THAT USED IN TWENTY FIVE SMALL AX FACTORIES HAVING THE SAME TOTAL OUTPUT THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY WORKMEN IN TWENTY FIVE SMALL FACTORIES WOULD USE TWENTY FIVE SHEARS
7520-258986-0040 ONE HUNDRED TRIP HAMMERS FIFTY GRINDSTONE PITS FIFTY POLISHING FRAMES A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MACHINES THE SAME ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN IN ONE LARGE FACTORY WOULD REQUIRE THREE SHEARS
7520-258986-0041 A SAVING OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY TRIP HAMMERS A SAVING OF EIGHTY THIRTY SEVEN GRINDSTONE PITS A SAVING OF THIRTEEN THIRTY POLISHING FRAMES A SAVING OF TWENTY
7520-258986-0042 A TOTAL OF NINETY MACHINES A SAVING OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MACHINES THE DIFFERENCE IN COST DUE TO MACHINERY IS NOT SO GREAT AS THESE FIGURES INDICATE AS THE UNUSED MACHINES LAST LONGER
7520-258986-0043 BUT IN THE SMALL FACTORY THERE IS MORE DEPRECIATION FROM RUST AND DECAY AND A LARGER PROPORTIONATE INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL FOR WHICH INTEREST MUST BE EARNED
7520-258986-0044 THE TECHNICAL ECONOMIES OF THE DIVISION OF LABOR CAN BE REALIZED IN LARGE MEASURE ONLY WHEN A NUMBER OF MEN WORK TOGETHER PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE ADVANTAGES IN THE USE OF MACHINERY BUT PARTLY FROM OTHER CAUSES
7520-258986-0045 LABOR IN A LARGE GROUP IS PROPORTIONATELY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IN A SMALL GROUP ESPECIALLY IN PRODUCING FORM VALUE IN MAKING PLOWS NINE MEN WORKING SEPARATELY WILL AVERAGE SIXTY SIX PLOWS EACH PER YEAR
7520-258986-0046 WHILE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MEN WORKING TOGETHER WILL AVERAGE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN EACH PER YEAR THE OUTPUT PER MAN BEING INCREASED SIXTY SIX AND TWO THIRDS PER CENT IN A RIFLE FACTORY WITH A DAILY OUTPUT OF FIFTY EIGHT MEN ARE NEEDED FOR THE SAME PRODUCT
7520-258986-0047 IN THE LARGER INDUSTRY THE COSTS OF MANAGEMENT SUPERVISION AND MARKETING ARE RELATIVELY LESS DIVISION OF LABOR DECREASES THE DIFFICULTY OF SUPERVISION IN LARGER FACTORIES WHERE THE PROCESSES ARE DIVIDED SYSTEMATIZED AND MADE A MATTER OF ROUTINE
7520-258986-0048 THE NECESSARY INSPECTION OF THE RESULTS IS MORE RAPID AND EASY THE ADVERTISING OF CERTAIN KINDS OF GOODS INVOLVES A LARGE AND INEVITABLE OUTLAY
7520-258986-0049 WHEN EACH MAN IS WORKING ON THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SUBDIVISION OF THE PRODUCT
7520-258986-0050 WHEN THE FINEST MACHINERY CAN BE KEPT CONSTANTLY IN USE ECONOMY IN ITS USE HAS REACHED THE MAXIMUM AS LARGE FACTORIES TEND TO CREATE CITIES AROUND THEM LAND RISES IN VALUE AND HIGHER WAGES MUST BE PAID THE WORKMEN
7520-258986-0051 SMALL FACTORIES ARE CONSTANTLY SEEKING OUT LOWER RENTS TAXES WAGES SALARIES CHEAPER LOCAL SOURCES OF MATERIALS CHEAP THOUGH LIMITED SOURCES OF POWER AND THUS THEY COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN MANY MARKETS
7520-258986-0052 THE POINT IS REACHED IN THE GROWTH OF ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE OVERSIGHT CANNOT BE AS PERFECT AND COMPLETE
7520-258986-0053 DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IDEA OF MONOPOLY THE OLD LEGAL IDEA OF A TRUST IS THE CONFIDENCE IMPOSED IN A TRUSTEE THE METHOD THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE EARLY COMBINATIONS WAS THE TRUST METHOD THAT IS THEY MADE USE OF THIS LEGAL DEVICE
7520-258986-0054 THE STOCK OF THE SEPARATE COMPANIES WAS PUT INTO THE HANDS OF A BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO WHOM WAS THUS GIVEN THE RIGHT TO CONTROL AS IT HAS BEEN FOUND POSSIBLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME END WITHOUT THE USE OF THIS LEGAL METHOD
7520-258986-0055 NO LONGER AGREES WITH THE LEGAL MEANING THE WORD TRUST IS POPULARLY USED OF ANY LARGE INDUSTRY THOUGH USUALLY THERE IS CONNECTED WITH IT THE IDEA OF SOME EVIL POWER
7520-258986-0056 A LARGE AGGREGATION CAN CONTROL CREDIT BETTER AND ESCAPE LOSS FROM BAD DEBTS BY REGULATING AND EQUALIZING THE OUTPUT IN THE DIFFERENT LOCALITIES IT CAN RUN MORE NEARLY FULL TIME
7520-258986-0057 A STRONG COMBINATION HAS ADVANTAGES IN SHIPMENT IT CAN HAVE A CLEARING HOUSE FOR ORDERS AND SHIP FROM THE NEAREST SOURCE OF SUPPLY THE LEAST EFFICIENT FACTORIES CAN BE FIRST CLOSED WHEN DEMAND FALLS OFF
7520-258986-0058 FACTORIES CAN BE SPECIALIZED TO PRODUCE THAT FOR WHICH EACH IS BEST FITTED THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INDUSTRY AND ITS PRESENCE IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES STRENGTHENS ITS INFLUENCE WITH THE RAILROADS
7520-258986-0059 THAT IS THE GROUPING UNDER ONE CONTROL OF A WHOLE SERIES OF INDUSTRIES ONE COMPANY MAY CARRY THE IRON ORE THROUGH ALL THE PROCESSES FROM THE MINE TO THE FINISHED PRODUCT A RAILROAD LINE ACROSS THE CONTINENT
7520-258986-0060 THERE IS THE GAIN FROM THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF GOODS TO CONSUMERS AND THERE IS THE GAIN FROM THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT FROM THE RISE AND FALL IN THE VALUE OF STOCK THE PROMOTERS OF A COMBINATION OFTEN EXPECT TO MAKE FROM SALES TO THE INVESTING PUBLIC
7520-258986-0061 FAR MORE THAN FROM SALES TO THE CONSUMER OF THE PRODUCT A SEASON OF PROSPERITY AND CONFIDENCE WHEN TRUSTS AND THEIR ENORMOUS PROFITS ARE CONSTANTLY DISCUSSED HAS AN EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC MIND LIKE THAT OF THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW EL DORADO A CALIFORNIA OR A KLONDIKE
7520-258986-0062 THEN IS THE TIME FOR THE WILY PROMOTER TO OFFER SHARES WITHOUT LIMIT TO INVESTORS THESE CONSIDERATIONS SHOW THAT THE TRUST IS NOT SIMPLE IN ITS CAUSE NOR IN ITS NATURE IN A SENSE THE MOST ARTIFICIAL OF INDUSTRIAL ARRANGEMENTS
7520-258986-0063 IN ANOTHER SENSE IT IS A NATURAL EVOLUTION OF INDUSTRY MORE AND MORE IT IS BEING RECOGNIZED THAT THOUGH IT HAS IN IT SOMETHING OF EVIL IT HAS AS WELL SOMETHING OF GOOD
