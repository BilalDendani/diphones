4396-14564-0000 THE LAKES THE VAST MORASSES
4396-14564-0001 THE CHINA OF EUROPE THE END OF THE EARTH AND THE BEGINNING OF THE OCEAN A MEASURELESS RAFT OF MUD AND SAND
4396-14564-0002 IT WILL VANISH WHENEVER THE HOLLANDERS SHALL ABANDON IT TO COMPREHEND THIS TRUTH WE MUST IMAGINE HOLLAND AS IT WAS WHEN FIRST INHABITED BY THE FIRST GERMAN TRIBES THAT WANDERED AWAY IN SEARCH OF A COUNTRY IT WAS ALMOST UNINHABITABLE
4396-14564-0003 THERE WERE VAST TEMPESTUOUS LAKES LIKE SEAS TOUCHING ONE ANOTHER MORASS BESIDE MORASS ONE TRACT AFTER ANOTHER COVERED WITH BRUSHWOOD IMMENSE FORESTS OF PINES OAKS AND ALDERS TRAVERSED BY HERDS OF WILD HORSES AND SO THICK WERE THESE FORESTS
4396-14564-0004 THAT TRADITION SAYS ONE COULD TRAVEL LEAGUES PASSING FROM TREE TO TREE WITHOUT EVER PUTTING FOOT TO THE GROUND THE DEEP BAYS AND GULFS CARRIED INTO THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY THE FURY OF THE NORTHERN TEMPESTS SOME PROVINCES DISAPPEARED ONCE EVERY YEAR UNDER THE WATERS OF THE SEA
4396-14564-0005 AND WERE NOTHING BUT MUDDY TRACTS NEITHER LAND NOR WATER
4396-14564-0006 SWEPT BY FURIOUS WINDS BEATEN BY OBSTINATE RAINS VEILED IN A PERPETUAL FOG WHERE NOTHING WAS HEARD BUT THE ROAR OF THE SEA AND THE VOICES OF WILD BEASTS AND BIRDS OF THE OCEAN THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO PLANT THEIR TENTS THERE
4396-14564-0007 HAD TO RAISE WITH THEIR OWN HANDS DIKES OF EARTH TO KEEP OUT THE RIVERS AND THE SEA AND LIVED WITHIN THEM LIKE SHIPWRECKED MEN UPON DESOLATE ISLANDS VENTURING FORTH AT THE SUBSIDENCE OF THE WATERS IN QUEST OF FOOD IN THE SHAPE OF FISH AND GAME
4396-14564-0008 EXPOSED TO THE INTEMPERANCE OF A CRUEL SKY AND THE FURY OF THE MYSTERIOUS NORTHERN SEA AND THE IMAGINATION PICTURES THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WHO FROM THE HEIGHTS OF THE UTTERMOST CITADELS OF THE EMPIRE BEATEN BY THE WAVES CONTEMPLATED WITH WONDER AND PITY
4396-14564-0009 BUT IT MUST BE ADDED THE CONQUEST GOES ON FOREVER TO EXPLAIN THIS FACT TO SHOW HOW THE EXISTENCE OF HOLLAND IN SPITE OF THE GREAT DEFENSIVE WORKS CONSTRUCTED BY THE INHABITANTS DEMANDS AN INCESSANT AND MOST PERILOUS STRUGGLE
4396-14564-0010 FROM THAT TIME EVERY GULF EVERY ISLAND AND IT MAY BE SAID EVERY CITY IN HOLLAND HAS ITS CATASTROPHE TO RECORD IN THIRTEEN CENTURIES IT IS RECORDED THAT ONE GREAT INUNDATION BESIDE SMALLER ONES HAS OCCURRED EVERY SEVEN YEARS
4396-14564-0011 AND THE COUNTRY BEING ALL PLAIN THESE INUNDATIONS WERE VERITABLE FLOODS TOWARDS THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THE SEA DESTROYED A PART OF A FERTILE PENINSULA NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE EMS AND SWALLOWED UP MORE THAN THIRTY VILLAGES IN THE COURSE OF THE SAME CENTURY
4396-14564-0012 A SERIES OF INUNDATIONS OPENED AN IMMENSE CHASM IN NORTHERN HOLLAND
4396-14564-0013 CAUSING THE DEATH OF MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND PERSONS IN FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE A TEMPEST SWELLED THE MEUSE SO THAT IN ONE NIGHT THE WATERS OVERWHELMED SEVENTY TWO VILLAGES AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INHABITANTS
4396-14564-0014 IN FIFTEEN THIRTY TWO THE SEA BURST THE DIKES OF ZEALAND DESTROYING HUNDREDS OF VILLAGES AND COVERING FOREVER A LARGE TRACT OF COUNTRY IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY A STORM CAUSED ANOTHER INUNDATION IN ZEALAND AND IN THE PROVINCE OF UTRECHT
4396-14564-0015 AMSTERDAM WAS INVADED BY THE WATERS AND IN FRIESLAND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE DROWNED OTHER GREAT INUNDATIONS TOOK PLACE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY TWO TERRIBLE ONES AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH
4396-14564-0016 AND ANOTHER GREAT ONE OF THE RHINE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE WHICH INVADED GUELDRES AND THE PROVINCE OF UTRECHT AND COVERED A GREAT PART OF NORTH BRABANT BESIDE THESE GREAT CATASTROPHES THERE HAPPENED IN DIFFERENT CENTURIES INNUMERABLE SMALLER ONES
4396-14564-0017 LIKE THE RISING OF THE LAKE OF HAARLEM ITSELF THE RESULT OF AN INUNDATION OF THE SEA FLOURISHING CITIES OF THE GULF OF ZUYDER ZEE VANISHED UNDER THE WATERS THE ISLANDS OF ZEALAND COVERED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY THE SEA AND AGAIN EMERGING VILLAGES OF THE COAST FROM HELDER TO THE MOUTHS OF THE MEUSE
4396-14564-0018 THE ENEMY FROM WHICH THEY HAD TO WREST IT WAS TRIPLE THE SEA THE LAKES THE RIVERS THEY DRAINED THE LAKES DROVE BACK THE SEA AND IMPRISONED THE RIVERS TO DRAIN THE LAKES THE HOLLANDERS PRESSED THE AIR INTO THEIR SERVICE
4396-14564-0019 THUS VAST TRACTS OF LAND BURIED UNDER THE WATER SAW THE SUN AND WERE TRANSFORMED AS IF BY MAGIC INTO FERTILE FIELDS COVERED WITH VILLAGES AND INTERSECTED BY CANALS AND ROADS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IN LESS THAN FORTY YEARS
4396-14564-0020 TWENTY SIX LAKES WERE DRAINED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY IN NORTH HOLLAND ALONE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND HECTARES OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES WERE THUS REDEEMED FROM THE WATERS IN SOUTH HOLLAND BEFORE EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR
4396-14564-0021 TWENTY NINE THOUSAND HECTARES IN THE WHOLE OF HOLLAND FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HECTARES SUBSTITUTING STEAM MILLS FOR WINDMILLS
4396-14564-0022 AND THEY ARE NOW MEDITATING THE PRODIGIOUS WORK OF DRYING UP THE ZUYDER ZEE WHICH EMBRACES AN AREA OF MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE KILOMETRES THE RIVERS ANOTHER ETERNAL ENEMY COST NO LESS OF LABOR AND SACRIFICE
4396-14564-0023 SOME LIKE THE RHINE WHICH LOST ITSELF IN THE SANDS BEFORE REACHING THE SEA HAD TO BE CHANNELED AND DEFENDED AT THEIR MOUTHS AGAINST THE TIDES BY FORMIDABLE CATARACTS OTHERS LIKE THE MEUSE BORDERED BY DIKES AS POWERFUL AS THOSE THAT WERE RAISED AGAINST THE OCEAN
4396-14564-0024 AND IN THIS WAY ALL THE RIVERS THAT FORMERLY SPREAD THEIR DEVASTATING FLOODS ABOUT THE COUNTRY WERE DISCIPLINED INTO CHANNELS AND CONSTRAINED TO DO SERVICE BUT THE MOST TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE WAS THE BATTLE WITH THE OCEAN
4396-14564-0025 HOLLAND IS IN GREAT PART LOWER THAN THE LEVEL OF THE SEA CONSEQUENTLY EVERYWHERE THAT THE COAST IS NOT DEFENDED BY SAND BANKS IT HAS TO BE PROTECTED BY DIKES
4396-14564-0026 THE WESTERN COAST OF THE ISLAND OF WALCHEREN IS DEFENDED BY A DIKE IN WHICH IT IS COMPUTED THAT THE EXPENSE OF CONSTRUCTION ADDED TO THAT OF PRESERVATION
4396-14564-0027 AROUND THE CITY OF HELDER AT THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF NORTH HOLLAND EXTENDS A DIKE TEN KILOMETRES LONG CONSTRUCTED OF MASSES OF NORWEGIAN GRANITE WHICH DESCENDS MORE THAN SIXTY METRES INTO THE SEA
4396-14564-0028 THE WHOLE PROVINCE OF FRIESLAND FOR THE LENGTH OF EIGHTY EIGHT KILOMETRES IS DEFENDED BY THREE ROWS OF PILES SUSTAINED BY MASSES OF NORWEGIAN AND GERMAN GRANITE AMSTERDAM
4396-14564-0029 HOLLAND IS AN IMPENETRABLE FORTRESS OF WHOSE IMMENSE BASTIONS THE MILLS ARE THE TOWERS THE CATARACTS ARE THE GATES THE ISLANDS THE ADVANCED FORTS AND LIKE A TRUE FORTRESS IT SHOWS TO ITS ENEMY THE SEA ONLY THE TOPS OF ITS BELL TOWERS AND THE ROOFS OF ITS HOUSES
4396-14564-0030 AS IF IN DEFIANCE AND DERISION
4396-14564-0031 ON A WAR FOOTING WITH THE SEA AN ARMY OF ENGINEERS DIRECTED BY THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR SPREAD OVER THE COUNTRY AND ORDERED LIKE AN ARMY CONTINUALLY SPY THE ENEMY WATCH OVER THE INTERNAL WATERS FORESEE THE BURSTING OF THE DIKES ORDER AND DIRECT THE DEFENSIVE WORKS
4396-14564-0032 THE PERIL IS UNCEASING THE SENTINELS ARE AT THEIR POSTS UPON THE BULWARKS
4396-14564-0033 AND EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO GREAT BATTLE A QUIET SILENT STRUGGLE IS FOREVER GOING ON THE INNUMERABLE MILLS EVEN IN THE DRAINED DISTRICTS CONTINUE TO WORK UNRESTING
4396-14564-0034 TO ABSORB AND TURN INTO THE CANALS THE WATER THAT FALLS IN RAIN AND THAT WHICH FILTERS IN FROM THE SEA EVERY DAY THE CATARACTS OF THE BAYS AND RIVERS CLOSE THEIR GIGANTIC GATES
4396-14564-0035 THE WORK OF STRENGTHENING DIKES FORTIFYING SAND BANKS WITH PLANTATIONS THROWING OUT NEW DIKES WHERE THE BANKS ARE LOW STRAIGHT AS GREAT LANCES VIBRATING IN THE BOSOM OF THE SEA AND BREAKING THE FIRST IMPETUS OF THE WAVE IS FOREVER GOING ON
4396-14564-0036 AND THE SEA ETERNALLY KNOCKS AT THE RIVER GATES BEATS UPON THE RAMPARTS GROWLS ON EVERY SIDE HER CEASELESS MENACE
4396-14564-0037 PILING UP BANKS OF SAND BEFORE THE GATES TO KILL THE COMMERCE OF THE CITIES
4396-14564-0038 AND FAILING TO OVERTHROW THE RAMPARTS UPON WHICH SHE FOAMS AND FUMES IN ANGRY EFFORT SHE CASTS AT THEIR FEET SHIPS FULL OF THE DEAD THAT THEY MAY ANNOUNCE TO THE REBELLIOUS COUNTRY HER FURY AND HER STRENGTH
4396-14564-0039 IN THE MIDST OF THIS GREAT AND TERRIBLE STRUGGLE HOLLAND IS TRANSFORMED HOLLAND IS THE LAND OF TRANSFORMATIONS
4396-14564-0040 TRANSFORMING THE SEA MEN ALSO ARE TRANSFORMED THE SEA AT SOME POINTS DRIVES BACK THE LAND IT TAKES PORTIONS FROM THE CONTINENT LEAVES THEM AND TAKES THEM AGAIN JOINS ISLANDS TO THE MAINLAND WITH ROPES OF SAND AS IN THE CASE OF ZEALAND
4396-14564-0041 BREAKS OFF BITS FROM THE MAINLAND AND MAKES NEW ISLANDS AS IN WIERINGEN RETIRES FROM CERTAIN COASTS AND MAKES LAND CITIES OUT OF WHAT WERE CITIES OF THE SEA
4396-14564-0042 IS TO CAUSE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA TO RISE IN SOME PLACES AND TO SINK IN OTHERS
4396-14564-0043 WHICH IS TO SEPARATE IT FROM SOUTH HOLLAND LAKES AS LARGE AS PROVINCES DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER LIKE THE LAKE OF BEEMSTER BY THE EXTRACTION OF PEAT LAND IS CONVERTED INTO LAKES AND THESE LAKES ARE AGAIN TRANSFORMED INTO MEADOWS
4396-14564-0044 AND THUS THE COUNTRY CHANGES ITS ASPECT ACCORDING TO THE VIOLENCE OF NATURE OR THE NEEDS OF MEN AND WHILE ONE GOES OVER IT WITH THE LATEST MAP IN HAND ONE MAY BE SURE THAT THE MAP WILL BE USELESS IN A FEW YEARS BECAUSE EVEN NOW THERE ARE NEW GULFS IN PROCESS OF FORMATION
4396-14564-0045 TRACTS OF LAND JUST READY TO BE DETACHED FROM THE MAINLAND AND GREAT CANALS BEING CUT THAT WILL CARRY LIFE TO UNINHABITED DISTRICTS BUT HOLLAND HAS DONE MORE THAN DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE WATERS SHE HAS MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF THEM AND HAS USED THEM FOR HER OWN DEFENSE
4396-14564-0046 WATER WAS THE SOURCE OF HER POVERTY SHE HAS MADE IT THE SOURCE OF WEALTH OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY EXTENDS AN IMMENSE NETWORK OF CANALS WHICH SERVES BOTH FOR THE IRRIGATION OF THE LAND AND AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION
4396-14564-0047 THE CITIES BY MEANS OF CANALS COMMUNICATE WITH THE SEA CANALS RUN FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND FROM THEM TO VILLAGES WHICH ARE THEMSELVES BOUND TOGETHER BY THESE WATERY WAYS AND ARE CONNECTED EVEN TO THE HOUSES SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY
4396-14564-0048 SMALLER CANALS SURROUND THE FIELDS AND ORCHARDS PASTURES AND KITCHEN GARDENS SERVING AT ONCE AS BOUNDARY WALL HEDGE AND ROAD WAY EVERY HOUSE IS A LITTLE PORT SHIPS BOATS RAFTS MOVE ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS
4396-14564-0049 AS IN OTHER PLACES CARTS AND CARRIAGES THE CANALS ARE THE ARTERIES OF HOLLAND AND THE WATER HER LIFE BLOOD BUT EVEN SETTING ASIDE THE CANALS THE DRAINING OF THE LAKES AND THE DEFENSIVE WORKS ON EVERY SIDE ARE SEEN THE TRACES OF MARVELOUS UNDERTAKINGS
4396-14564-0050 THE SOIL WHICH IN OTHER COUNTRIES IS A GIFT OF NATURE IS IN HOLLAND A WORK OF MEN'S HANDS HOLLAND DRAWS THE GREATER PART OF HER WEALTH FROM COMMERCE BUT BEFORE COMMERCE COMES THE CULTIVATION OF THE SOIL AND THE SOIL HAD TO BE CREATED
4396-14564-0051 THERE WAS NO WOOD BECAUSE THE FORESTS HAD ALREADY BEEN DESTROYED BY TEMPESTS WHEN AGRICULTURE BEGAN THERE WAS NO STONE THERE WERE NO METALS
4396-14564-0052 HAD REFUSED ALL HER GIFTS TO HOLLAND THE HOLLANDERS HAD TO DO EVERYTHING IN SPITE OF NATURE THEY BEGAN BY FERTILIZING THE SAND IN SOME PLACES THEY FORMED A PRODUCTIVE SOIL WITH EARTH BROUGHT FROM A DISTANCE AS A GARDEN IS MADE
4396-14564-0053 THEY MIXED WITH THE SANDY EARTH THE REMAINS OF PEAT TAKEN FROM THE BOTTOMS
4396-14564-0054 THEY LABORED TO BREAK UP THE DOWNS WITH THE PLOW AND THUS IN A THOUSAND WAYS AND CONTINUALLY FIGHTING OFF THE MENACING WATERS THEY SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING HOLLAND TO A STATE OF CULTIVATION NOT INFERIOR TO THAT OF MORE FAVORED REGIONS THAT HOLLAND
4396-14564-0055 THAT SANDY MARSHY COUNTRY WHICH THE ANCIENTS CONSIDERED ALL BUT UNINHABITABLE
4396-14564-0056 POSSESSES ABOUT ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE AND IN PROPORTION TO THE EXTENT OF HER TERRITORY MAY BE ACCOUNTED ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS OF EUROPEAN STATES
4396-14564-0057 IT IS SUFFICIENT TO CONTEMPLATE THE MONUMENTS OF THEIR GREAT STRUGGLE WITH THE SEA IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS MUST BE FIRMNESS AND PATIENCE ACCOMPANIED BY A CALM AND CONSTANT COURAGE THAT GLORIOUS BATTLE
4396-14564-0058 AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF OWING EVERYTHING TO THEIR OWN STRENGTH MUST HAVE INFUSED AND FORTIFIED IN THEM
4396-14564-0059 THE NECESSITY OF A CONSTANT STRUGGLE OF A CONTINUOUS LABOR AND OF PERPETUAL SACRIFICES IN DEFENSE OF THEIR EXISTENCE FOREVER TAKING THEM BACK TO A SENSE OF REALITY
4396-14564-0060 ECONOMY ONE OF THEIR CHIEF VIRTUES THEY MUST BE EXCELLENT IN ALL USEFUL ARTS SPARING OF DIVERSION SIMPLE EVEN IN THEIR GREATNESS SUCCEEDING IN WHAT THEY UNDERTAKE BY DINT OF TENACITY AND A THOUGHTFUL AND ORDERLY ACTIVITY
4396-14564-0061 AND BY VIRTUE OF THESE QUALITIES OF PRUDENCE PHLEGMATIC ACTIVITY AND THE SPIRIT OF CONSERVATISM THEY ARE EVER ADVANCING THOUGH BY SLOW DEGREES THEY ACQUIRE GRADUALLY BUT NEVER LOSE WHAT THEY HAVE GAINED HOLDING STUBBORNLY TO THEIR ANCIENT CUSTOMS
4396-14564-0062 IT IS ENOUGH ALSO TO REMEMBER ITS FORM IN ORDER TO COMPREHEND THAT THIS COUNTRY OF THREE MILLIONS AND A HALF OF INHABITANTS ALTHOUGH BOUND IN SO COMPACT A POLITICAL UNION
4396-14564-0063 ALTHOUGH RECOGNIZABLE AMONG ALL THE OTHER NORTHERN PEOPLES BY CERTAIN TRAITS PECULIAR TO THE POPULATION OF ALL ITS PROVINCES MUST PRESENT A GREAT VARIETY AND SO IT IS IN FACT BETWEEN ZEALAND AND HOLLAND PROPER
4396-14564-0064 BETWEEN HOLLAND AND FRIESLAND BETWEEN FRIESLAND AND GUELDRES BETWEEN GRONINGEN AND BRABANT IN SPITE OF VICINITY AND SO MANY COMMON TICS THERE IS NO LESS DIFFERENCE THAN BETWEEN THE MORE DISTANT PROVINCES OF ITALY AND FRANCE DIFFERENCE OF LANGUAGE COSTUME AND CHARACTER
4396-14564-0065 DIFFERENCE OF RACE AND OF RELIGION THE COMMUNAL REGIME HAS IMPRESSED AN INDELIBLE MARK UPON THIS PEOPLE
4396-14564-0066 THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED INTO VARIOUS GROUPS OF INTERESTS ORGANIZED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM WHENCE ASSOCIATION AND MUTUAL HELP AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY THE SEA BUT LIBERTY FOR LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND FORCES
4396-14564-0067 MONARCHY HAS NOT EXTINGUISHED THE ANCIENT MUNICIPAL SPIRIT AND THIS IT IS THAT RENDERS IMPOSSIBLE A COMPLETE FUSION OF THE STATE IN ALL THE GREAT STATES THAT HAVE MADE THE ATTEMPT THE GREAT RIVERS AND GULFS
4396-14564-0068 ARE AT THE SAME TIME COMMERCIAL ROADS SERVING AS NATIONAL BONDS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PROVINCES AND BARRIERS WHICH DEFEND OLD TRADITIONS AND OLD CUSTOMS IN EACH THE DUTCH MASTERS FROM HOLLAND AND ITS PEOPLE
4396-14564-0069 THE ONLY TWO TO WHICH THE TITLE RIGOROUSLY BELONGS THE OTHERS BEING ONLY DAUGHTERS OR YOUNGER SISTERS
4396-14564-0070 THUS EVEN IN PAINTING HOLLAND OFFERS THAT WHICH IS MOST SOUGHT AFTER IN TRAVEL AND IN BOOKS OF TRAVEL THE NEW DUTCH PAINTING WAS BORN WITH THE LIBERTY AND INDEPENDENCE OF HOLLAND
4396-14564-0071 BLOEMART FOLLOWED CORREGGIO AND IL MORO COPIED TITIAN NOT TO INDICATE OTHERS AND THEY WERE ONE AND ALL PEDANTIC IMITATORS WHO ADDED TO THE EXAGGERATIONS OF THE ITALIAN STYLE A CERTAIN GERMAN COARSENESSS THE RESULT OF WHICH WAS A
4396-14564-0072 BASTARD STYLE OF PAINTING STILL INFERIOR TO THE FIRST CHILDISH STIFF IN DESIGN CRUDE IN COLOR
4396-14564-0073 BUT AT LEAST NOT A SERVILE IMITATION AND BECOMING AS IT WERE A FAINT PRELUDE OF THE TRUE DUTCH ART THAT WAS TO BE WITH THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE LIBERTY REFORM AND PAINTING ALSO WERE RENEWED
4396-14564-0074 THE FACULTIES WHICH HAD BEEN EXCITED AND STRENGTHENED IN THE GRAND UNDERTAKING OF CREATING A NATION NOW THAT THE WORK WAS COMPLETED OVERFLOWED AND RAN INTO NEW CHANNELS THE CONDITIONS OF THE COUNTRY WERE FAVORABLE TO THE REVIVAL OF ART
4396-14564-0075 TO PROSAIC REALITIES BY THE OCCUPATIONS OF A VULGAR BURGHER LIFE CULTIVATING ITS REASON AT THE EXPENSE OF ITS IMAGINATION LIVING CONSEQUENTLY MORE IN CLEAR IDEAS THAN IN BEAUTIFUL IMAGES TAKING REFUGE FROM ABSTRACTIONS
4396-14564-0076 NEVER DARTING ITS THOUGHTS BEYOND THAT NATURE WITH WHICH IT IS IN PERPETUAL BATTLE SEEING ONLY THAT WHICH IS ENJOYING ONLY THAT WHICH IT CAN POSSESS MAKING ITS HAPPINESS CONSIST IN THE TRANQUIL EASE AND HONEST SENSUALITY OF A LIFE WITHOUT VIOLENT PASSIONS
4396-14564-0077 PRECISION AND DELICACY THOUGH MATERIAL LIKE THEIR LIVES IN ONE WORD A REALISTIC ART IN WHICH THEY CAN SEE THEMSELVES AS THEY ARE AND AS THEY ARE CONTENT TO BE
4396-14564-0078 THE ARTISTS BEGAN BY TRACING THAT WHICH THEY SAW BEFORE THEIR EYES THE HOUSE THE LONG WINTERS THE PERSISTENT RAINS THE DAMPNESS THE VARIABLENESS OF THE CLIMATE
4396-14564-0079 HE LIKED TO LOOK OUT FROM HIS WELL STOPPED WINDOWS AT THE FALLING SNOW AND THE DRENCHING RAIN AND TO
4396-14564-0080 RAGE TEMPEST I AM WARM AND SAFE SNUG IN HIS SHELL HIS FAITHFUL HOUSEWIFE BESIDE HIM HIS CHILDREN ABOUT HIM
4396-14564-0081 THE DUTCH PAINTERS REPRESENTED THESE HOUSES AND THIS LIFE IN LITTLE PICTURES PROPORTIONATE TO THE SIZE OF THE WALLS ON WHICH THEY WERE TO HANG THE BEDCHAMBERS THAT MAKE ONE FEEL A DESIRE TO SLEEP THE KITCHENS THE TABLES SET OUT THE FRESH AND SMILING FACES OF THE HOUSE MOTHERS
4396-14564-0082 THE MEN AT THEIR EASE AROUND THE FIRE AND WITH THAT CONSCIENTIOUS REALISM WHICH NEVER FORSAKES THEM THEY DEPICT THE DOZING CAT THE YAWNING DOG THE CLUCKING HEN THE BROOM THE VEGETABLES THE SCATTERED POTS AND PANS THE CHICKEN READY FOR THE SPIT
4396-14564-0083 THE DANCE THE CONVERSAZIONE THE ORGIE THE FEAST THE GAME AND THUS DID TERBURG
4396-14564-0084 BECOME FAMOUS AFTER DEPICTING THE HOUSE THEY TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE COUNTRY THE STERN CLIMATE ALLOWED BUT A BRIEF TIME FOR THE ADMIRATION OF NATURE BUT FOR THIS VERY REASON DUTCH ARTISTS ADMIRED HER ALL THE MORE
4396-14564-0085 THEY SALUTED THE SPRING WITH A LIVELIER JOY AND PERMITTED THAT FUGITIVE SMILE OF HEAVEN TO STAMP ITSELF MORE DEEPLY ON THEIR FANCY THE COUNTRY WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS TWICE DEAR BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE SEA AND FROM THE FOREIGN OPPRESSOR
4396-14564-0086 THE DUTCH ARTIST PAINTED IT LOVINGLY HE REPRESENTED IT SIMPLY INGENUOUSLY WITH A SENSE OF INTIMACY WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS NOT TO BE FOUND IN ITALIAN OR BELGIAN LANDSCAPE THE FLAT MONOTONOUS COUNTRY HAD TO THE DUTCH PAINTER'S EYES
4396-14564-0087 A MARVELOUS VARIETY HE CAUGHT ALL THE MUTATIONS OF THE SKY AND KNEW THE VALUE OF THE WATER WITH ITS REFLECTIONS ITS GRACE AND FRESHNESS AND ITS POWER OF ILLUMINATING EVERYTHING HAVING NO MOUNTAINS HE TOOK THE DIKES FOR BACKGROUND
4396-14564-0088 ASSELYN BUT THE PALM REMAINS WITH THE LANDSCAPISTS OF HOLLAND WITH WYNANTS THE PAINTER OF MORNING
4396-14564-0089 WITH RUYSDAEL THE PAINTER OF MELANCHOLY WITH HOBBEMA THE ILLUSTRATOR OF WINDMILLS CABINS AND KITCHEN GARDENS
4396-14564-0090 AS SHE IS IN HOLLAND SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH LANDSCAPE ART WAS BORN ANOTHER KIND OF PAINTING ESPECIALLY PECULIAR TO HOLLAND ANIMAL PAINTING
4396-14564-0091 THAT MAGNIFICENT RACE OF CATTLE WHICH HAS NO RIVAL IN EUROPE FOR FECUNDITY AND BEAUTY THE HOLLANDERS WHO OWE SO MUCH TO THEM
4396-14564-0092 AND EXCITING IN THE SPECTATOR'S HEART A SENTIMENT OF ARCADIAN GENTLENESS AND PATRIARCHAL SERENITY THE DUTCH ARTISTS STUDIED THESE ANIMALS IN ALL THEIR VARIETIES IN ALL THEIR HABITS AND DIVINED AS ONE MAY SAY THEIR INNER LIFE AND SENTIMENTS
4396-14564-0093 ANIMATING THE TRANQUIL BEAUTY OF THE LANDSCAPE WITH THEIR FORMS RUBENS LUYDERS PAUL DE VOS AND OTHER BELGIAN PAINTERS
4396-14564-0094 BERGHEM KAREL DU JARDIN AND BY THE PRINCE OF ANIMAL PAINTERS PAUL POTTER WHOSE FAMOUS BULL IN THE GALLERY OF THE HAGUE DESERVES TO BE PLACED IN THE VATICAN BESIDE THE TRANSFIGURATION BY RAPHAEL IN YET ANOTHER FIELD ARE THE DUTCH PAINTERS GREAT THE SEA
4396-14564-0095 THAT TURBULENT NORTH SEA FULL OF SINISTER COLOR WITH A LIGHT OF INFINITE MELANCHOLY UPON IT BEATING FOREVER UPON A DESOLATE COAST MUST SUBJUGATE THE IMAGINATION OF THE ARTIST HE PASSES INDEED LONG HOURS ON THE SHORE CONTEMPLATING ITS TREMENDOUS BEAUTY
4396-14564-0096 VENTURES UPON ITS WAVES TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF TEMPESTS BUYS A VESSEL AND SAILS WITH HIS WIFE AND FAMILY OBSERVING AND MAKING NOTES FOLLOWS THE FLEET INTO BATTLE AND TAKES PART IN THE FIGHT AND IN THIS WAY ARE MADE MARINE PAINTERS LIKE WILLIAM VAN DER VELDE THE ELDER AND WILLIAM THE YOUNGER
4396-14564-0097 LIKE BACKHUYSEN DUBBELS AND STORK ANOTHER KIND OF PAINTING WAS TO ARISE IN HOLLAND AS THE EXPRESSION OF THE CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE AND OF REPUBLICAN MANNERS A PEOPLE WHICH WITHOUT GREATNESS HAD DONE SO MANY GREAT THINGS AS MICHELET SAYS
4396-14564-0098 MUST HAVE ITS HEROIC PAINTERS IF WE CALL THEM SO DESTINED TO ILLUSTRATE MEN AND EVENTS BUT THIS SCHOOL OF PAINTING PRECISELY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WERE WITHOUT GREATNESS OR TO EXPRESS IT BETTER WITHOUT THE FORM OF GREATNESS
4396-14564-0099 MODEST INCLINED TO CONSIDER ALL EQUAL BEFORE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE ALL HAD DONE THEIR DUTY ABHORRING ADULATION AND THE GLORIFICATION IN ONE ONLY OF THE VIRTUES AND THE TRIUMPH OF MANY THIS SCHOOL HAS TO ILLUSTRATE NOT A FEW MEN WHO HAVE EXCELLED
4396-14564-0100 AND A FEW EXTRAORDINARY FACTS BUT ALL CLASSES OF CITIZENSHIP GATHERED AMONG THE MOST ORDINARY AND PACIFIC OF BURGHER LIFE FROM THIS COME THE GREAT PICTURES WHICH REPRESENT FIVE TEN THIRTY PERSONS TOGETHER ARQUEBUSIERS MAYORS
4396-14564-0101 OFFICERS PROFESSORS MAGISTRATES ADMINISTRATORS SEATED OR STANDING AROUND A TABLE FEASTING AND CONVERSING OF LIFE SIZE MOST FAITHFUL LIKENESSES GRAVE OPEN FACES EXPRESSING THAT SECURE SERENITY OF CONSCIENCE BY WHICH MAY BE DIVINED RATHER THAN SEEN
4396-14564-0102 THE NOBLENESS OF A LIFE CONSECRATED TO ONE'S COUNTRY THE CHARACTER OF THAT STRONG LABORIOUS EPOCH THE MASCULINE VIRTUES OF THAT EXCELLENT GENERATION ALL THIS SET OFF BY THE FINE COSTUME OF THE TIME
4396-14564-0103 SO ADMIRABLY COMBINING GRACE AND DIGNITY THOSE GORGETS THOSE DOUBLETS THOSE BLACK MANTLES THOSE SILKEN SCARVES AND RIBBONS THOSE ARMS AND BANNERS IN THIS FIELD STAND PRE EMINENT VAN DER HELST HALS
4396-14564-0104 ONE LEADS ALL THE REST AS THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF DUTCH PAINTING THE LIGHT THE LIGHT IN HOLLAND BY REASON OF THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF ITS MANIFESTATION COULD NOT FAIL TO GIVE RISE TO A SPECIAL MANNER OF PAINTING A PALE LIGHT
4396-14564-0105 WAVING WITH MARVELOUS MOBILITY THROUGH AN ATMOSPHERE IMPREGNATED WITH VAPOR A NEBULOUS VEIL CONTINUALLY AND ABRUPTLY TORN A PERPETUAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW SUCH WAS THE SPECTACLE WHICH ATTRACTED THE EYE OF THE ARTIST
4396-14564-0106 HE BEGAN TO OBSERVE AND TO REPRODUCE ALL THIS AGITATION OF THE HEAVENS THIS STRUGGLE WHICH ANIMATES WITH VARIED AND FANTASTIC LIFE THE SOLITUDE OF NATURE IN HOLLAND AND IN REPRESENTING IT THE STRUGGLE PASSED INTO HIS SOUL AND INSTEAD OF REPRESENTING
4396-14564-0107 SUNSET REFLECTIONS AND THE YELLOW RAYS OF LAMP LIGHT WERE BLENDED WITH DELICATE MANIPULATION INTO MYSTERIOUS SHADOWS AND THEIR DIM DEPTHS WERE PEOPLED WITH HALF SEEN FORMS AND THUS HE CREATED ALL SORTS OF CONTRASTS ENIGMAS
4396-14564-0108 PLAY AND EFFECT OF STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED CHIAROSCURO IN THIS FIELD AMONG MANY STAND CONSPICUOUS GERARD DOW THE AUTHOR OF THE FAMOUS FOUR CANDLE PICTURE AND THE GREAT MAGICIAN AND SOVEREIGN ILLUMINATOR
4396-14564-0109 THERE IS THE FACT THAT IN A COUNTRY SO FLAT SO UNIFORM AND SO GRAY AS HOLLAND THERE IS THE SAME NEED OF COLOR AS IN SOUTHERN LANDS THERE IS NEED OF SHADE THE DUTCH ARTISTS DID BUT FOLLOW THE IMPERIOUS TASTE OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN
4396-14564-0110 WHO PAINTED THEIR HOUSES IN VIVID COLORS AS WELL AS THEIR SHIPS AND IN SOME PLACES THE TRUNKS OF THEIR TREES AND THE PALINGS AND FENCES OF THEIR FIELDS AND GARDENS WHOSE DRESS WAS OF THE GAYEST RICHEST HUES WHO LOVED TULIPS AND HYACINTHS EVEN TO MADNESS
4396-14564-0111 AND THUS THE DUTCH PAINTERS WERE POTENT COLORISTS AND REMBRANDT WAS THEIR CHIEF REALISM NATURAL TO THE CALMNESS AND SLOWNESS OF THE DUTCH CHARACTER WAS TO GIVE TO THEIR ART YET ANOTHER DISTINCTIVE FEATURE FINISH
4396-14564-0112 WHICH WAS CARRIED TO THE VERY EXTREME OF POSSIBILITY IT IS TRULY SAID
4396-14564-0113 EVERY VEIN IN THE WOOD OF A PIECE OF FURNITURE EVERY FIBRE IN A LEAF THE THREADS OF CLOTH THE STITCHES IN A PATCH EVERY HAIR UPON AN ANIMAL'S COAT EVERY WRINKLE IN A MAN'S FACE EVERYTHING FINISHED WITH MICROSCOPIC PRECISION AS IF DONE WITH A FAIRY PENCIL
4396-14564-0114 BUT A DEFECT CARRIED TO SUCH A PITCH OF PERFECTION THAT ONE ADMIRES AND DOES NOT FIND FAULT IN THIS RESPECT THE MOST FAMOUS PRODIGIES OF PATIENCE WERE DOW
4396-14564-0115 POTTER AND VAN DER HEIST BUT MORE OR LESS ALL THE DUTCH PAINTERS BUT REALISM WHICH GIVES TO DUTCH ART SO ORIGINAL A STAMP AND SUCH ADMIRABLE QUALITIES IS YET THE ROOT OF ITS MOST SERIOUS DEFECTS
4396-14564-0116 THE ARTISTS DESIROUS ONLY OF REPRESENTING MATERIAL TRUTHS GAVE TO THEIR FIGURES NO EXPRESSION SAVE THAT OF THEIR PHYSICAL SENTIMENTS GRIEF LOVE ENTHUSIASM AND THE THOUSAND DELICATE SHADES OF FEELING THAT HAVE NO NAME OR TAKE A DIFFERENT ONE
4396-14564-0117 IS WANTING IN THEIR PICTURES MORE IN THEIR FAITHFUL REPRODUCTION OF EVERYTHING EVEN THE UGLY AND ESPECIALLY THE UGLY THEY END BY EXAGGERATING EVEN THAT MAKING DEFECTS INTO DEFORMITIES AND PORTRAITS INTO CARICATURES
4396-14564-0118 AND CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED AT BUT EVEN SETTING ASIDE THESE EXCESSES IN THE PICTURE GALLERIES OF HOLLAND THERE IS TO BE FOUND NOTHING THAT ELEVATES THE MIND OR MOVES IT TO HIGH AND GENTLE THOUGHTS YOU ADMIRE YOU ENJOY YOU LAUGH
4396-14564-0119 YOU STAND PENSIVE FOR A MOMENT BEFORE SOME CANVAS BUT COMING OUT YOU FEEL THAT SOMETHING IS LACKING TO YOUR PLEASURE YOU EXPERIENCE A DESIRE TO LOOK UPON A HANDSOME COUNTENANCE TO READ INSPIRED VERSES AND SOMETIMES YOU CATCH YOURSELF MURMURING HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY
4396-14564-0120 O RAPHAEL FINALLY THERE ARE STILL TWO IMPORTANT EXCELLENCES TO BE RECORDED OF THIS SCHOOL OF PAINTING ITS VARIETY AND ITS IMPORTANCE AS THE EXPRESSION THE MIRROR SO TO SPEAK OF THE COUNTRY
4396-14564-0121 WHICH WAS THE WORSHIP OF MATERIAL TRUTH HAVE ARRIVED AT SEPARATE AND DISTINCT GOALS THEIR REALISM THEN INCITING THEM TO DISDAIN NOTHING AS FOOD FOR THE PENCIL HAS SO ACTED THAT DUTCH ART SUCCEEDS IN REPRESENTING HOLLAND MORE COMPLETELY
4396-14564-0122 THAN HAS EVER BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY ANY OTHER SCHOOL IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY
