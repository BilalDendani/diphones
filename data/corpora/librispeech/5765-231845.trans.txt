5765-231845-0000 FOR THERE WERE FOUR POINTS AT LEAST WHICH COULD BE PROVED PAST ALL DOUBT AS INCRIMINATING HER STRONGLY IN THE MATTER IN THE FIRST PLACE THE FEMALE SHADOW ON THE BLIND SEEN BY LUCIAN SHOWED THAT A WOMAN HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF ENTERING THE HOUSE BY THE SECRET WAY OF THE CELLAR
5765-231845-0001 AND DURING THE ABSENCE OF VRAIN SECONDLY THE FINDING OF THE PARTI COLOURED RIBBON IN THE SILENT HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN KNOTTED ROUND THE HANDLE OF THE STILETTO BY DIANA AND THE ABSENCE OF THE STILETTO ITSELF FROM ITS USUAL PLACE ON THE WALL OF THE BERWIN MANOR LIBRARY
5765-231845-0002 PROVED THAT THE WEAPON HAD BEEN REMOVED THEREFROM TO LONDON AND PRESUMABLY USED TO COMMIT THE DEED SEEING THAT OTHERWISE THERE WAS NO NECESSITY FOR ITS PRESENCE IN THE GENEVA SQUARE MANSION THIRDLY DIANA HAD DISCOVERED THAT LYDIA HAD SPENT THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER IN TOWN
5765-231845-0003 AND LASTLY SHE ALSO DECLARED THAT THE FRAGMENT OF GAUZE FOUND BY LUCIAN ON THE DIVIDING FENCE WAS THE PROPERTY OF MISSUS VRAIN THIS QUARTETTE OF CHARGES WAS RECAPITULATED BY DIANA IN SUPPORT OF HER ACCUSATION OF HER STEPMOTHER
5765-231845-0004 I ALWAYS SUSPECTED LYDIA AS INDIRECTLY GUILTY SHE DECLARED IN CONCLUDING HER SPEECH FOR THE PROSECUTION
5765-231845-0005 BUT DID SHE SAID DENZIL BY NO MEANS CONVINCED
5765-231845-0006 RETORTED DIANA INDIGNANTLY SHE WAS IN TOWN ON CHRISTMAS EVE SHE TOOK THE STILETTO FROM THE LIBRARY AND YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT INTERRUPTED LUCIAN DECIDEDLY THEN SEEING THE LOOK OF ANGER ON DIANA'S FACE HE HASTENED TO APOLOGISE
5765-231845-0007 EXCUSE ME MISS VRAIN HE SAID NERVOUSLY I AM NOT THE LESS YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE I COMBAT YOUR ARGUMENTS BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS NECESSARY TO LOOK ON BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION IS IT POSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT MISSUS VRAIN REMOVED THIS DAGGER NOBODY ACTUALLY SAW IT IN HER POSSESSION
5765-231845-0008 LET US SAY COUNT FERRUCI SUGGESTED DENZIL DIANA POINTED TO THE FRAGMENT OF THE VEIL LYING ON THE TABLE ON THE EVIDENCE OF THAT PIECE OF GAUZE SHE SAID IT WAS LYDIA WHO ENTERED THE HOUSE AGAIN YOU SAW HER SHADOW ON THE WINDOW BLIND
5765-231845-0009 I SAW TWO SHADOWS CORRECTED LUCIAN HASTILY THOSE OF A MAN AND A WOMAN IN PLAIN ENGLISH MISTER DENZIL THOSE OF MISSUS VRAIN AND COUNT FERRUCI WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF THAT BUT CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IS NOT ALWAYS CONCLUSIVE MISS VRAIN
5765-231845-0010 IF MISSUS VRAIN KILLED HER HUSBAND SHE MUST HAVE HAD A STRONG MOTIVE TO DO SO WELL SAID DIANA IMPATIENTLY THERE IS THE ASSURANCE MONEY I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MOTIVE IS QUITE STRONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THIS WOMAN IN RISKING HER NECK RESPONDED THE BARRISTER
5765-231845-0011 AS MISSUS VRAIN OF BERWIN MANOR SHE HAD AN AMPLE INCOME FOR YOUR FATHER SEEMS TO HAVE LEFT ALL THE RENTS TO HER AND SPENT BUT LITTLE ON HIMSELF
5765-231845-0012 YOU CAN SEE HER AT ONCE AND DIANA ROSE TO RING THE BELL ONE MOMENT INTERPOSED LUCIAN BEFORE SHE COULD TOUCH THE BUTTON TELL ME IF MISS TYLER KNOWS YOUR REASON FOR BRINGING HER UP I HAVE NOT TOLD HER DIRECTLY SAID DIANA WITH SOME BLUNTNESS
5765-231845-0013 BUT AS SHE IS NO FOOL I FANCY SHE SUSPECTS
5765-231845-0014 UNLESS ADDED LUCIAN SIGNIFICANTLY YOU DESIRE TO TAKE HER INTO OUR CONFIDENCE NO SAID DIANA PROMPTLY I DO NOT THINK IT IS WISE TO TAKE HER INTO OUR CONFIDENCE SHE IS RATHER WELL TO PUT IT PLAINLY MISTER DENZIL RATHER A GOSSIP
5765-231845-0015 AS SUCH DO YOU CONSIDER HER EVIDENCE RELIABLE WE CAN PICK THE GRAINS OF WHEAT OUT OF THE CHAFF NO DOUBT SHE EXAGGERATES AND GARBLES AFTER THE FASHION OF A SCANDAL LOVING WOMAN BUT HER EVIDENCE IS VALUABLE ESPECIALLY AS SHOWING THAT LYDIA WAS NOT AT BATH ON CHRISTMAS EVE
5765-231845-0016 WE WILL TELL HER NOTHING SO SHE CAN SUSPECT AS MUCH AS SHE LIKES IF WE DO SPEAK FREELY SHE WILL SPREAD THE GOSSIP AND IF WE DON'T SHE WILL INVENT WORSE FACTS SO IN EITHER CASE IT DOESN'T MATTER
5765-231845-0017 BUT FEARFUL OF GIVING OFFENCE TO HIS COMPANION HE SPEEDILY COMPOSED HIS FEATURES WITH MUCH EXPLANATION AND AN EXHIBITION OF MISS GREEB'S PLAN HE GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS DISCOVERIES BEGINNING WITH HIS VISIT TO THE CELLAR AND ENDING WITH THE IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WITH HIS LANDLADY
5765-231845-0018 DIANA LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND WHEN HE CONCLUDED GAVE IT AS HER OPINION THAT LYDIA HAD ENTERED THE FIRST YARD BY THE SIDE PASSAGE AND HAD CLIMBED OVER THE FENCE INTO THE SECOND AS IS CLEARLY PROVED BY THE VEIL SHE CONCLUDED DECISIVELY
5765-231845-0019 EXPECTED HER CRIED DIANA THUNDERSTRUCK IMPOSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THAT REPLIED LUCIAN DRILY
5765-231845-0020 BUT WHEN I MET YOUR FATHER THE SECOND TIME HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO PROVE BY LETTING ME EXAMINE THE HOUSE
5765-231845-0021 THAT I AM CERTAIN HE WAS WELL AWARE THE SHADOWS I SAW WERE THOSE OF PEOPLE HE KNEW WERE IN THE ROOM NOW IF THE WOMAN WAS MISSUS VRAIN SHE MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF VISITING YOUR FATHER BY THE BACK WAY AND FERRUCI ALSO
5765-231845-0022 NO MORE THAN I AM CERTAIN THE OTHER WAS MISSUS VRAIN BUT THE VEIL LUCIAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN DESPAIR THAT SEEMS TO PROVE IT WAS SHE HE SAID DUBIOUSLY BUT I CAN'T EXPLAIN YOUR FATHER'S CONDUCT IN RECEIVING HER IN SO SECRETIVE A WAY
5765-231845-0023 THE WHOLE THING IS BEYOND ME WELL WHAT IS TO BE DONE SAID DIANA AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH THEY LOOKED BLANKLY AT ONE ANOTHER I MUST THINK MY HEAD IS TOO CONFUSED JUST NOW WITH THIS CONFLICTING EVIDENCE TO PLAN ANY LINE OF ACTION
5765-231845-0024 AS A RELIEF LET US EXAMINE YOUR FRIEND AND HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY DIANA ASSENTED AND TOUCHED THE BELL SHORTLY MISS TYLER APPEARED USHERED IN BY A NERVOUS WAITER TO WHOM IT WOULD SEEM SHE HAD ADDRESSED A SHARP ADMONITION ON HIS WANT OF DEFERENCE
5765-231845-0025 IMMEDIATELY ON ENTERING SHE POUNCED DOWN ON MISS VRAIN LIKE A HAWK ON A DOVE PECKED HER ON BOTH CHEEKS ADDRESSED HER AS MY DEAREST DI AND FINALLY PERMITTED HERSELF WITH DOWNCAST EYES AND A MODEST DEMEANOUR TO BE INTRODUCED TO LUCIAN
5765-231845-0026 IT MIGHT BE INFERRED FROM THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTION THAT MISS TYLER WAS A YOUNG AND ARDENT DAMSEL IN HER TEENS WHEREAS SHE WAS CONSIDERABLY NEARER FORTY THAN THIRTY AND POSSESSED AN UNCOMELY ASPECT UNPLEASING TO MALE EYES HER OWN WERE OF A COLD GREY
5765-231845-0027 HER LIPS WERE THIN HER WAIST PINCHED IN AND AS THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF TIGHT LACING HER NOSE WAS RED HER SCANTY HAIR WAS DRAWN OFF HER HIGH FOREHEAD VERY TIGHTLY
5765-231845-0028 AND SHE SMILED OCCASIONALLY IN AN ACID MANNER WITH MANY TEETH SHE WORE A PLAINLY MADE GREEN DRESS WITH A TOBY FRILL AND A LARGE SILVER CROSS DANGLED ON HER FLAT BOSOM
5765-231845-0029 ALTOGETHER SHE WAS ABOUT AS VENOMOUS A SPECIMEN OF AN UNAPPROPRIATED BLESSING AS CAN WELL BE IMAGINED BELLA SAID MISS VRAIN TO THIS UNATTRACTIVE FEMALE FOR CERTAIN REASONS WHICH I MAY TELL YOU HEREAFTER
5765-231845-0030 MISTER DENZIL WISHES TO KNOW IF MISSUS VRAIN WAS AT BERWIN MANOR ON CHRISTMAS EVE OF COURSE SHE WAS NOT DEAREST DI SAID BELLA DROOPING HER ELDERLY HEAD ON ONE SCRAGGY SHOULDER WITH AN ACID SMILE DIDN'T I TELL YOU SO I WAS ASKED BY LYDIA
5765-231845-0031 TO SPEND CHRISTMAS AT BERWIN MANOR SHE INVITED ME FOR MY SINGING AND PLAYING YOU KNOW AND AS WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE OURSELVES AGREEABLE I CAME TO SEE HER ON THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS SHE RECEIVED A LETTER BY THE EARLY POST WHICH SEEMED TO UPSET HER A GREAT DEAL
5765-231845-0032 AND TOLD ME SHE WOULD HAVE TO RUN UP TO TOWN ON BUSINESS SHE DID AND STAYED ALL NIGHT AND CAME DOWN NEXT MORNING TO KEEP CHRISTMAS
5765-231845-0033 ASKED LUCIAN OH SHE DIDN'T TELL ME SAID BELLA TOSSING HER HEAD AT LEAST NOT DIRECTLY BUT I GATHERED FROM WHAT SHE SAID THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH POOR DEAR MISTER CLYNE HER FATHER YOU KNOW DEAREST DI WAS THE LETTER FROM HIM

5765-231845-0036 ADDED MISS TYLER WITH A VENOMOUS SMILE THAT LYDIA DID NOT GO UP TO MEET HIM WHY SHOULD SHE DEMANDED LUCIAN BLUNTLY OH I'M NOT BLIND CRIED BELLA SHRILLY LAUGHING NO INDEED
5765-231845-0037 THE COUNT A MOST AMIABLE MAN WAS VERY ATTENTIVE TO ME AT ONE TIME AND LYDIA A MARRIED WOMAN I REGRET TO SAY DID NOT LIKE HIM BEING SO
5765-231845-0038 THAT MISSUS VRAIN KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND THAN SHE CHOOSES TO ADMIT OH I'VE READ ALL THE PAPERS I KNOW ALL ABOUT THE DEATH MISS TYLER SAID LUCIAN ALARMED BELLA CRIED MISS VRAIN I
5765-231845-0039 OH I'M NOT BLIND DEAREST INTERRUPTED BELLA SPEAKING VERY FAST I KNOW YOU ASK ME THESE QUESTIONS TO FIND OUT IF LYDIA KILLED HER HUSBAND WELL SHE DID
