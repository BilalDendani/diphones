4344-22232-0000 DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK AN INCIDENT WHEN FARMER OAK SMILED THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH SPREAD TILL THEY WERE WITHIN AN UNIMPORTANT DISTANCE OF HIS EARS HIS EYES WERE REDUCED TO CHINKS
4344-22232-0001 AND DIVERGING WRINKLES APPEARED ROUND THEM EXTENDING UPON HIS COUNTENANCE LIKE THE RAYS IN A RUDIMENTARY SKETCH OF THE RISING SUN HIS CHRISTIAN NAME WAS GABRIEL
4344-22232-0002 AND ON WORKING DAYS HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF SOUND JUDGMENT EASY MOTIONS PROPER DRESS AND GENERAL GOOD CHARACTER ON SUNDAYS HE WAS A MAN OF MISTY VIEWS RATHER GIVEN TO POSTPONING AND HAMPERED BY HIS BEST CLOTHES AND UMBRELLA
4344-22232-0003 WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE COMMUNION PEOPLE OF THE PARISH AND THE DRUNKEN SECTION
4344-22232-0004 AND THOUGHT OF WHAT THERE WOULD BE FOR DINNER WHEN HE MEANT TO BE LISTENING TO THE SERMON OR TO STATE HIS CHARACTER AS IT STOOD IN THE SCALE OF PUBLIC OPINION WHEN HIS FRIENDS AND CRITICS WERE IN TANTRUMS HE WAS CONSIDERED RATHER A BAD MAN WHEN THEY WERE PLEASED HE WAS RATHER A GOOD MAN
4344-22232-0005 WHEN THEY WERE NEITHER HE WAS A MAN WHOSE MORAL COLOUR WAS A KIND OF PEPPER AND SALT MIXTURE
4344-22232-0006 WAS MOST PECULIARLY HIS OWN THE MENTAL PICTURE FORMED BY HIS NEIGHBOURS IN IMAGINING HIM BEING ALWAYS DRESSED IN THAT WAY HE WORE A LOW CROWNED FELT HAT SPREAD OUT AT THE BASE BY TIGHT JAMMING UPON THE HEAD FOR SECURITY IN HIGH WINDS
4344-22232-0007 AND A COAT LIKE DOCTOR JOHNSON'S HIS LOWER EXTREMITIES BEING ENCASED IN ORDINARY LEATHER LEGGINGS AND BOOTS EMPHATICALLY LARGE AFFORDING TO EACH FOOT A ROOMY APARTMENT SO CONSTRUCTED THAT ANY WEARER MIGHT STAND IN A RIVER ALL DAY LONG AND KNOW NOTHING OF DAMP
4344-22232-0008 THEIR MAKER BEING A CONSCIENTIOUS MAN WHO ENDEAVOURED TO COMPENSATE FOR ANY WEAKNESS IN HIS CUT BY UNSTINTED DIMENSION AND SOLIDITY MISTER OAK CARRIED ABOUT HIM BY WAY OF WATCH WHAT MAY BE CALLED A SMALL SILVER CLOCK
4344-22232-0009 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS A WATCH AS TO SHAPE AND INTENTION AND A SMALL CLOCK AS TO SIZE THIS INSTRUMENT BEING SEVERAL YEARS OLDER THAN OAK'S GRANDFATHER HAD THE PECULIARITY OF GOING EITHER TOO FAST OR NOT AT ALL
4344-22232-0010 THE SMALLER OF ITS HANDS TOO OCCASIONALLY SLIPPED ROUND ON THE PIVOT AND THUS THOUGH THE MINUTES WERE TOLD WITH PRECISION NOBODY COULD BE QUITE CERTAIN OF THE HOUR THEY BELONGED TO THE STOPPING PECULIARITY OF HIS WATCH OAK REMEDIED BY THUMPS AND SHAKES
4344-22232-0011 AND HE ESCAPED ANY EVIL CONSEQUENCES FROM THE OTHER TWO DEFECTS BY CONSTANT COMPARISONS WITH AND OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN AND STARS AND BY PRESSING HIS FACE CLOSE TO THE GLASS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WINDOWS
4344-22232-0012 TILL HE COULD DISCERN THE HOUR MARKED BY THE GREEN FACED TIMEKEEPERS WITHIN IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT OAK'S FOB BEING DIFFICULT OF ACCESS BY REASON OF ITS SOMEWHAT HIGH SITUATION IN THE WAISTBAND OF HIS TROUSERS WHICH ALSO LAY AT A REMOTE HEIGHT UNDER HIS WAISTCOAT
4344-22232-0013 THE WATCH WAS AS A NECESSITY PULLED OUT BY THROWING THE BODY TO ONE SIDE COMPRESSING THE MOUTH AND FACE TO A MERE MASS OF RUDDY FLESH ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXERTION REQUIRED AND DRAWING UP THE WATCH BY ITS CHAIN LIKE A BUCKET FROM A WELL
4344-22232-0014 BUT SOME THOUGHTFUL PERSONS WHO HAD SEEN HIM WALKING ACROSS ONE OF HIS FIELDS ON A CERTAIN DECEMBER MORNING SUNNY AND EXCEEDINGLY MILD MIGHT HAVE REGARDED GABRIEL OAK IN OTHER ASPECTS THAN THESE
4344-22232-0015 IN HIS FACE ONE MIGHT NOTICE THAT MANY OF THE HUES AND CURVES OF YOUTH HAD TARRIED ON TO MANHOOD THERE EVEN REMAINED IN HIS REMOTER CRANNIES SOME RELICS OF THE BOY HIS HEIGHT AND BREADTH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE IMPOSING
4344-22232-0016 HAD THEY BEEN EXHIBITED WITH DUE CONSIDERATION BUT THERE IS A WAY SOME MEN HAVE RURAL AND URBAN ALIKE FOR WHICH THE MIND IS MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN FLESH AND SINEW IT IS A WAY OF CURTAILING THEIR DIMENSIONS BY THEIR MANNER OF SHOWING THEM
4344-22232-0017 AND FROM A QUIET MODESTY THAT WOULD HAVE BECOME A VESTAL WHICH SEEMED CONTINUALLY TO IMPRESS UPON HIM THAT HE HAD NO GREAT CLAIM ON THE WORLD'S ROOM OAK WALKED UNASSUMINGLY AND WITH A FAINTLY PERCEPTIBLE BEND YET DISTINCT FROM A BOWING OF THE SHOULDERS
4344-22232-0018 THIS MAY BE SAID TO BE A DEFECT IN AN INDIVIDUAL IF HE DEPENDS FOR HIS VALUATION MORE UPON HIS APPEARANCE THAN UPON HIS CAPACITY TO WEAR WELL WHICH OAK DID NOT
4344-22232-0019 HE HAD JUST REACHED THE TIME OF LIFE AT WHICH YOUNG IS CEASING TO BE THE PREFIX OF MAN IN SPEAKING OF ONE HE WAS AT THE BRIGHTEST PERIOD OF MASCULINE GROWTH FOR HIS INTELLECT AND HIS EMOTIONS WERE CLEARLY SEPARATED
4344-22232-0020 HE HAD PASSED THE TIME DURING WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF YOUTH INDISCRIMINATELY MINGLES THEM IN THE CHARACTER OF IMPULSE AND HE HAD NOT YET ARRIVED AT THE STAGE WHEREIN THEY BECOME UNITED AGAIN IN THE CHARACTER OF PREJUDICE BY THE INFLUENCE OF A WIFE AND FAMILY
4344-22232-0021 THE FIELD HE WAS IN THIS MORNING SLOPED TO A RIDGE CALLED NORCOMBE HILL THROUGH A SPUR OF THIS HILL RAN THE HIGHWAY BETWEEN EMMINSTER AND CHALK NEWTON
4344-22232-0022 PAINTED YELLOW AND GAILY MARKED DRAWN BY TWO HORSES A WAGGONER WALKING ALONGSIDE BEARING A WHIP PERPENDICULARLY THE WAGGON WAS LADEN WITH HOUSEHOLD GOODS AND WINDOW PLANTS AND ON THE APEX OF THE WHOLE SAT A WOMAN YOUNG AND ATTRACTIVE
4344-22232-0023 GABRIEL HAD NOT BEHELD THE SIGHT FOR MORE THAN HALF A MINUTE
4344-22232-0024 SAID THE WAGGONER THEN I HEARD IT FALL SAID THE GIRL IN A SOFT THOUGH NOT PARTICULARLY LOW VOICE I HEARD A NOISE I COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR WHEN WE WERE COMING UP THE HILL
4344-22232-0025 DO SHE ANSWERED THE SENSIBLE HORSES STOOD PERFECTLY STILL AND THE WAGGONER'S STEPS SANK FAINTER AND FAINTER IN THE DISTANCE THE GIRL ON THE SUMMIT OF THE LOAD SAT MOTIONLESS
4344-22232-0026 SURROUNDED BY TABLES AND CHAIRS WITH THEIR LEGS UPWARDS BACKED BY AN OAK SETTLE AND ORNAMENTED IN FRONT BY POTS OF GERANIUMS MYRTLES AND CACTUSES TOGETHER WITH A CAGED CANARY
4344-22232-0027 IN A WILLOW BASKET FROM THE PARTLY OPENED LID OF WHICH SHE GAZED WITH HALF CLOSED EYES AND AFFECTIONATELY SURVEYED THE SMALL BIRDS AROUND
4344-22232-0028 THE HANDSOME GIRL WAITED FOR SOME TIME IDLY IN HER PLACE AND THE ONLY SOUND HEARD IN THE STILLNESS WAS THE HOPPING OF THE CANARY UP AND DOWN THE PERCHES OF ITS PRISON THEN SHE LOOKED ATTENTIVELY DOWNWARDS
4344-22232-0029 IT WAS AT AN OBLONG PACKAGE TIED IN PAPER AND LYING BETWEEN THEM SHE TURNED HER HEAD TO LEARN IF THE WAGGONER WERE COMING
4344-22232-0030 AT LENGTH SHE DREW THE ARTICLE INTO HER LAP AND UNTIED THE PAPER COVERING A SMALL SWING LOOKING GLASS WAS DISCLOSED IN WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO SURVEY HERSELF ATTENTIVELY SHE PARTED HER LIPS AND SMILED
4344-22232-0031 IT WAS A FINE MORNING AND THE SUN LIGHTED UP TO A SCARLET GLOW THE CRIMSON JACKET SHE WORE AND PAINTED A SOFT LUSTRE UPON HER BRIGHT FACE AND DARK HAIR THE MYRTLES GERANIUMS AND CACTUSES PACKED AROUND HER WERE FRESH AND GREEN
4344-22232-0032 AND AT SUCH A LEAFLESS SEASON THEY INVESTED THE WHOLE CONCERN OF HORSES WAGGON FURNITURE AND GIRL WITH A PECULIAR VERNAL CHARM WHAT POSSESSED HER TO INDULGE IN SUCH A PERFORMANCE IN THE SIGHT OF THE SPARROWS BLACKBIRDS AND UNPERCEIVED FARMER
4344-22232-0033 WHO WERE ALONE ITS SPECTATORS WHETHER THE SMILE BEGAN AS A FACTITIOUS ONE TO TEST HER CAPACITY IN THAT ART NOBODY KNOWS IT ENDED CERTAINLY IN A REAL SMILE SHE BLUSHED AT HERSELF AND SEEING HER REFLECTION BLUSH BLUSHED THE MORE
4344-22232-0034 THE CHANGE FROM THE CUSTOMARY SPOT AND NECESSARY OCCASION OF SUCH AN ACT FROM THE DRESSING HOUR IN A BEDROOM TO A TIME OF TRAVELLING OUT OF DOORS LENT TO THE IDLE DEED A NOVELTY IT DID NOT INTRINSICALLY POSSESS
4344-22232-0035 THE PICTURE WAS A DELICATE ONE WOMAN'S PRESCRIPTIVE INFIRMITY HAD STALKED INTO THE SUNLIGHT WHICH HAD CLOTHED IT IN THE FRESHNESS OF AN ORIGINALITY A CYNICAL INFERENCE WAS IRRESISTIBLE BY GABRIEL OAK AS HE REGARDED THE SCENE
4344-22232-0036 OR PRESS A DIMPLE INTO SHAPE OR DO ONE THING TO SIGNIFY THAT ANY SUCH INTENTION HAD BEEN HER MOTIVE IN TAKING UP THE GLASS SHE SIMPLY OBSERVED HERSELF AS A FAIR PRODUCT OF NATURE IN THE FEMININE KIND HER THOUGHTS SEEMING TO GLIDE INTO FAR OFF THOUGH LIKELY DRAMAS
4344-22232-0037 IN WHICH MEN WOULD PLAY A PART VISTAS OF PROBABLE TRIUMPHS THE SMILES BEING OF A PHASE SUGGESTING THAT HEARTS WERE IMAGINED AS LOST AND WON STILL THIS WAS BUT CONJECTURE
4344-22232-0038 AND THE WHOLE SERIES OF ACTIONS WAS SO IDLY PUT FORTH AS TO MAKE IT RASH TO ASSERT THAT INTENTION HAD ANY PART IN THEM AT ALL THE WAGGONER'S STEPS WERE HEARD RETURNING
4344-22232-0039 AND DESCENDING INTO THE ROAD FOLLOWED THE VEHICLE TO THE TURNPIKE GATE SOME WAY BEYOND THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL WHERE THE OBJECT OF HIS CONTEMPLATION NOW HALTED FOR THE PAYMENT OF TOLL ABOUT TWENTY STEPS STILL REMAINED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GATE WHEN HE HEARD A DISPUTE
4344-22232-0040 YOU GREAT MISER AND SHE WON'T PAY ANY MORE THESE WERE THE WAGGONER'S WORDS
4344-22232-0041 SAID THE TURNPIKE KEEPER CLOSING THE GATE OAK LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE DISPUTANTS AND FELL INTO A REVERIE
4344-22232-0042 BUT TWOPENCE HERE HE SAID STEPPING FORWARD AND HANDING TWOPENCE TO THE GATEKEEPER LET THE YOUNG WOMAN PASS HE LOOKED UP AT HER THEN SHE HEARD HIS WORDS AND LOOKED DOWN
4344-22232-0043 GABRIEL'S FEATURES ADHERED THROUGHOUT THEIR FORM SO EXACTLY TO THE MIDDLE LINE BETWEEN THE BEAUTY OF SAINT JOHN AND THE UGLINESS OF JUDAS ISCARIOT AS REPRESENTED IN A WINDOW OF THE CHURCH HE ATTENDED THAT NOT A SINGLE LINEAMENT COULD BE SELECTED AND CALLED WORTHY
4344-22232-0044 EITHER OF DISTINCTION OR NOTORIETY THE RED JACKETED AND DARK HAIRED MAIDEN SEEMED TO THINK SO TOO FOR SHE CARELESSLY GLANCED OVER HIM AND TOLD HER MAN TO DRIVE ON
4344-22232-0045 MORE PROBABLY SHE FELT NONE FOR IN GAINING HER A PASSAGE HE HAD LOST HER HER POINT AND WE KNOW HOW WOMEN TAKE A FAVOUR OF THAT KIND THE GATEKEEPER SURVEYED THE RETREATING VEHICLE THAT'S A HANDSOME MAID HE SAID TO OAK
4344-22232-0046 BUT SHE HAS HER FAULTS SAID GABRIEL TRUE FARMER
4344-22232-0047 WHAT IT IS ALWAYS BEATING PEOPLE DOWN AY TIS SO O NO WHAT THEN
4344-22232-0048 GABRIEL PERHAPS A LITTLE PIQUED BY THE COMELY TRAVELLER'S INDIFFERENCE GLANCED BACK TO WHERE HE HAD WITNESSED HER PERFORMANCE OVER THE HEDGE AND SAID
