2309-152159-0000 IN A SUBURBAN TOWN ON A COUNTRY ROAD IT SEEMED CHILDISHLY ABSURD THAT HE COULD NOT AT LEAST DIFFERENTIATE TO THAT EXTENT AND YET FROM THE MOMENT HE HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE AUTOMOBILE IN WHICH HE NOW FOUND HIMSELF HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT HE COULD NOT TELL
2309-152159-0001 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE DO WHAT THEY WOULD TO PREVENT IT
2309-152159-0002 TO THE LOCATION OF WHAT HE NOW CALLED APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH IT SEEMED THE CRIME CLUB BUT HE HAD NEVER RIDDEN BLINDFOLDED IN A CAR BEFORE HE COULD SEE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND IF THAT INCREASED OR ACCENTUATED HIS SENSE OF HEARING IT HELPED LITTLE
2309-152159-0003 THEY WERE RUNNING ON AN ASPHALT ROAD THAT WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH BUT CITY STREETS AND SUBURBAN STREETS AND HUNDREDS OF MILES OF COUNTRY ROAD AROUND NEW YORK WERE OF ASPHALT TRAFFIC HE WAS QUITE SURE FOR HE HAD STRAINED HIS EARS IN AN EFFORT TO DETECT IT
2309-152159-0004 THAT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO TRAFFIC BUT THEN IT MUST BE ONE OR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT THAT HOUR THE CITY STREETS CERTAINLY THOSE THAT WOULD BE CHOSEN BY THESE MEN WOULD BE QUITE AS DESERTED AS ANY COUNTRY ROAD AND AS FOR A SENSE OF DIRECTION
2309-152159-0005 HE HAD NONE WHATEVER EVEN IF THE CAR HAD NOT BEEN PERSISTENTLY SWERVING AND CHANGING ITS COURSE EVERY LITTLE WHILE IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FORM EVEN AN APPROXIMATE IDEA OF THE COMPASS DIRECTION IN WHICH THEY HAD STARTED
2309-152159-0006 HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ABLE IN A GENERAL WAY TO COUNTERACT THIS FURTHER EFFORT OF THEIRS TO CONFUSE HIM BUT WITHOUT THE INITIAL DIRECTION
2309-152159-0007 HE WAS ESSENTIALLY BEFOGGED WITH THESE CONCLUSIONS FINALLY THRUST HOME UPON HIM JIMMIE DALE PHILOSOPHICALLY SUBORDINATED THE MATTER IN HIS MIND AND LEANING BACK COMPOSED HIMSELF AS COMFORTABLY AS HE COULD UPON HIS SEAT THERE WAS A MAN BESIDE HIM
2309-152159-0008 AND HE COULD FEEL THE LEGS OF TWO MEN ON THE SEAT FACING HIM THESE WITH THE DRIVER WOULD MAKE FOUR HE WAS STILL WELL GUARDED THE CAR ITSELF WAS A CLOSED CAR NOT HOODED THE SENSE OF TOUCH TOLD HIM THEREFORE A LIMOUSINE OF SOME DESCRIPTION
2309-152159-0009 THESE FACTS IN A SENSE INCONSEQUENTIAL WERE ABSORBED SUBCONSCIOUSLY AND THEN JIMMIE DALE'S BRAIN REMORSELESSLY ACTIVE IN SPITE OF THE PAIN FROM HIS THROBBING HEAD WAS AT WORK AGAIN
2309-152159-0010 IN THE EARLY EVENING AS LARRY THE BAT HE HAD BURROWED SO IRONICALLY FOR REFUGE IN CHANG FOO'S DEN FROM HER IT SEEMED LIKE SOME MOCKING UNREALITY SOME VISIONARY DREAM THAT SO SHORT A WHILE BEFORE
2309-152159-0011 HE HAD READ THOSE WORDS OF HERS THAT HAD SENT THE BLOOD COURSING AND LEAPING THROUGH HIS VEINS
2309-152159-0012 IN AN HOUR AN HOUR AND HE WAS TO HAVE SEEN HER THE WOMAN WHOSE FACE HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE WOMAN WHOM HE LOVED AND THE HOUR INSTEAD
2309-152159-0013 THE HOURS SINCE THEN HAD BROUGHT A NIGHTMARE OF EVENTS SO INCREDIBLE AS TO SEEM BUT PHANTOMS OF THE IMAGINATION PHANTOMS HE SAT UP SUDDENLY WITH A JERK THE FACE OF THE DEAD CHAUFFEUR THE LIMP FORM LASHED IN THAT CHAIR
2309-152159-0014 EVERY DETAIL STANDING OUT IN GHASTLY RELIEF TOOK FORM BEFORE HIM GOD KNEW THERE WAS NO PHANTOM THERE THE MAN BESIDE HIM AT THE SUDDEN START LIFTED A HAND AND FELT HURRIEDLY OVER THE BANDAGE ACROSS JIMMIE DALE'S EYES
2309-152159-0015 HE HAD HAD NEITHER TIME NOR OPPORTUNITY TO THINK BEFORE
2309-152159-0016 ALL SHOCK WHEN HE HAD ENTERED THAT ROOM BUT NOW LIKE AN INSPIRATION HE SAW IT ALL FROM ANOTHER ANGLE THERE WAS A GLARING FALLACY IN THE GAME THESE MEN HAD PLAYED FOR HIS BENEFIT TO NIGHT A FALLACY WHICH THEY HAD COUNTED ON GLOSSING OVER
2309-152159-0017 BASED ON A SUPPOSITION WHICH MIGHT AFTER ALL BE WRONG AND BEING WRONG MEANT DEATH BUT IT WAS NOT SUPPOSITION EITHER HE WAS RIGHT NOW OR THESE MEN WERE CHILDISH IMMATURE FOOLS AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY MIGHT BE
2309-152159-0018 THEY WERE NOT THAT NOT A SINGLE DROP OF POISON HAD PASSED THE CHAUFFEUR'S LIPS THE MAN HAD NOT BEEN MURDERED IN THAT ROOM HE HAD NOT IN A SENSE BEEN MURDERED AT ALL THE MAN ABSOLUTELY UNQUESTIONABLY WITHOUT A LOOPHOLE FOR DOUBT
2309-152159-0019 HAD EITHER BEEN KILLED OUTRIGHT IN THE AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT
2309-152159-0020 PROBABLY WITHOUT REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS CERTAINLY WITHOUT SUPPLYING ANY OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS SO DETERMINEDLY SOUGHT YES HE SAW IT NOW THEIR BACKS WERE AGAINST THE WALL THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END THESE MEN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE CHAUFFEUR POSSESSED
2309-152159-0021 THAT THEY KNEW HE POSSESSED WAS EVIDENTLY LIFE AND DEATH TO THEM TO KILL THE MAN BEFORE THEY HAD WORMED OUT OF HIM WHAT THEY WANTED TO KNOW
2309-152159-0022 IT COULD BE ONLY SPECULATION HE HAD DECIDED THAT ONCE BEFORE THE MAN AT HIS SIDE FELT AGAIN OVER THE SCARF TO SEE THAT IT WAS IN PLACE
2309-152159-0023 IF THEY HAD DELIBERATELY MURDERED THE CHAUFFEUR BECAUSE OF A REFUSAL TO ANSWER
2309-152159-0024 FOOL THAT HE HAD BEEN NOT TO HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE AND YET WOULD IT HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
2309-152159-0025 IF THE CHAUFFEUR HAD SUFFERED DEATH RATHER THAN TALK EVEN ADMITTING THE FACT THAT THEY HAD MORE GROUNDS FOR SUSPECTING THE CHAUFFEUR'S COMPLICITY WOULD HIS JIMMIE DALE'S MERE DENIAL HIS CHOICE TOO OF DEATH
2309-152159-0026 WHERE IT HAD NOT SAVED THE OTHER'S A CERTAIN ADDED RESPECT FOR THESE MEN AGAINST WHOM UNTIL THE END NOW HIS VICTORY OR THEIRS HE REALISED HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE CAME OVER HIM AS HE RECOGNISED THE TOUCH OF A MASTER HAND
2309-152159-0027 THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO FIND THE TOCSIN THE PACKAGE THAT SHE HAD SAID WAS VITAL TO THEM WAS STILL BEYOND THEIR REACH THE CHAUFFEUR WAS DEAD AND HE JIMMIE DALE ALONE REMAINED A CLEW THAT THEY HAD STILL TO PROVE VALID OR INVALID IT WAS TRUE
2309-152159-0028 BUT THE ONLY CLEW IN THEIR POSSESSION AND GAINING NOTHING FROM HIM BY A SHOW OF FORCE TO THROW HIM OFF HIS GUARD THEY HAD LET HIM GO MEANING HIM TO BELIEVE THEY WERE CONVINCED HE KNEW NOTHING AND THAT THE EPISODE
2309-152159-0029 THE ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WAS AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED ENDED FINISHED AND DONE WITH TIME PASSED A VERY LONG TIME AS HE SAT THERE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN HOUR HE COULD ONLY HAZARD A GUESS NOT ONE OF THE MEN IN THE CAR HAD SPOKEN A WORD
2309-152159-0030 BUT TO JIMMIE DALE THE CAR ITSELF THE RIDE ITS DURATION THESE THREE STRANGE COMPANIONS WERE FOR THE TIME BEING EXTRANEOUS EVEN THAT SICK GIDDINESS IN HIS HEAD HAD AT LEAST TEMPORARILY GONE FROM HIM
2309-152159-0031 AND SO ALL UNSUSPECTINGLY HE WAS TO LEAD THEM TO THE TOCSIN AND FALL INTO THE TRAP HIMSELF HIS HANDS THRUST DEEP IN HIS POCKETS WERE TIGHTLY CLENCHED THEY WERE CLEVER ENOUGH
2309-152159-0032 AND HE WITH HER HE HAD PLAYED BLINDLY INTO THEIR HANDS AND THROUGH HIM SHE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THEIR POWER
2309-152159-0033 AND THEN FURY ANGER
2309-152159-0034 TO STRANGLE TO STAMP OUT THIS INHUMAN BAND OF CRIMINALS THAT WITH INTOLERABLE EFFRONTERY
2309-152159-0035 FOR THEIR MONSTROUS PURPOSES AND THEN JIMMIE DALE IN THE DARKNESS SMILED AGAIN GRIMLY AS THE LEADER'S REFERENCE TO THE GRAY SEAL RECURRED TO HIM WELL PERHAPS WHO KNEW THEY WOULD HAVE REASON MORE THAN THEY DREAMED OF TO WISH THE GRAY SEAL ENROLLED IN THEIR OWN RANKS
2309-152159-0036 IT WAS STRANGE CURIOUS HE HAD THOUGHT ALL THAT WAS ENDED ONLY A FEW SHORT HOURS BEFORE HE HAD HIDDEN AWAY ALL EVERYTHING THAT WAS INCIDENT TO THE LIFE OF THE GRAY SEAL THE CLOTHES OF LARRY THE BAT
2309-152159-0037 THAT LITTLE METAL CASE WITH THE GRAY COLOURED ADHESIVE SEALS A DOZEN OTHER THINGS BELIEVING THAT IT ONLY REMAINED FOR HIM TO RETURN AND DESTROY THEM AT HIS LEISURE AS A FINISHING TOUCH TO THE GRAY SEAL'S CAREER
2309-152159-0038 THAT SHE HAD EVER CALLED UPON HIM TO UNDERTAKE
2309-152159-0039 WHERE THEY NOW CERTAINLY BELIEVED HIM TO BE ENTIRELY OFF HIS GUARD HE WAS THOROUGHLY ON HIS GUARD AND WHERE THEY MIGHT SUSPECT HIM WATCH HIM THEY WOULD SUSPECT AND WATCH ONLY THE CHARACTER THE PERSON OF JIMMIE DALE
2309-152159-0040 AND COUNT NOT AT ALL UPON EITHER LARRY THE BAT OR THE GRAY SEAL A SORT OF SAVAGE ELATION FELL UPON JIMMIE DALE HIS BRAIN THAT HAD BEEN STAGNANT CONFUSED PHYSICALLY SICK WITH PAIN AND SUFFERING WAS WORKING NOW WITH ITS OLD TIME VIGOUR
2309-152159-0041 AND EASE MAPPING PLANNING SCHEMING THE WAY AHEAD TO STRIKE AND STRIKE QUICKLY TO STRIKE FIRST IT MUST BE HIS MOVE NEXT NOT THEIRS AND HE MUST ACT TO NIGHT AT ONCE THE MOMENT HE WAS GIVEN THIS PRETENCE TO LIBERTY
2309-152159-0042 THAT THEY HAD IN STORE FOR HIM BEFORE THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF CLOSING DOWN AROUND HIM WITH A NETWORK OF SPIES THAT HE COULD NOT ELUDE BY MORNING JIMMIE DALE WOULD BE LARRY THE BAT AND INHABITING THE SANCTUARY AGAIN AND A TIP TO JASON HIS OLD BUTLER
2309-152159-0043 TO THE EFFECT SAY THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY FOR A TRIP WOULD ACCOUNT FOR HIS DISAPPEARANCE SATISFACTORILY ENOUGH IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY AROUSE THEIR SUSPICIONS WHEN THEY EVENTUALLY DISCOVERED HE WAS GONE
2309-152159-0044 AND NOW WITH HIS MIND MADE UP TO HIS COURSE OF ACTION
2309-152159-0045 AN IRRITATION AT THE USELESS TWISTINGS AND TURNINGS OF THE CAR THAT HAD LATTERLY BECOME MORE FREQUENT TOOK HOLD UPON HIM HOW MUCH LONGER WAS THIS TO LAST THEY MUST HAVE BEEN FULLY AN HOUR AND A HALF ON THE ROAD ALREADY AND AH THE CAR WAS STOPPING NOW
2309-152159-0046 HE STRAIGHTENED UP IN HIS SEAT AS THE MACHINE CAME TO A HALT BUT THE MAN AT HIS SIDE LAID A RESTRAINING HAND UPON HIM THE CAR DOOR OPENED AND ONE OF THE MEN GOT OUT JIMMIE DALE CAUGHT AN INDISTINCT MURMUR OF VOICES FROM WITHOUT
2309-152159-0047 WHAT WAS THE ULTERIOR MOTIVE BEHIND THAT PRETENCE WHAT DID THIS PACKAGE THAT HAD ALREADY COST A MAN HIS LIFE TO NIGHT CONTAIN WHO WAS THE CHAUFFEUR
2309-152159-0048 COULD SHE SUPPLY THE LINKS THAT WOULD FORGE THE CHAIN INTO AN UNBROKEN WHOLE AND THEN FOR THE SECOND TIME THE CAR SLOWED DOWN AND THIS TIME THE MAN ON THE SEAT BESIDE JIMMIE DALE REACHED UP AND UNTIED THE SCARF
