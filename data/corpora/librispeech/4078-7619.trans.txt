4078-7619-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN OOLANGA MISTER SALTON HAD AN APPOINTMENT FOR SIX O'CLOCK AT LIVERPOOL WHEN HE HAD DRIVEN OFF SIR NATHANIEL TOOK ADAM BY THE ARM MAY I COME WITH YOU FOR A WHILE TO YOUR STUDY
4078-7619-0001 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU PRIVATELY WITHOUT YOUR UNCLE KNOWING ABOUT IT OR EVEN WHAT THE SUBJECT IS
4078-7619-0002 IS IT NECESSARY TO KEEP MY UNCLE IN THE DARK ABOUT IT HE MIGHT BE OFFENDED IT IS NOT NECESSARY BUT IT IS ADVISABLE IT IS FOR HIS SAKE THAT I ASKED MY FRIEND IS AN OLD MAN
4078-7619-0003 AND IT MIGHT CONCERN HIM UNDULY EVEN ALARM HIM I PROMISE YOU THERE SHALL BE NOTHING THAT COULD CAUSE HIM ANXIETY IN OUR SILENCE OR AT WHICH HE COULD TAKE UMBRAGE GO ON SIR SAID ADAM SIMPLY
4078-7619-0004 YOU SEE YOUR UNCLE IS NOW AN OLD MAN I KNOW IT FOR WE WERE BOYS TOGETHER HE HAS LED AN UNEVENTFUL AND SOMEWHAT SELF CONTAINED LIFE SO THAT ANY SUCH CONDITION OF THINGS AS HAS NOW ARISEN
4078-7619-0005 IS APT TO PERPLEX HIM FROM ITS VERY STRANGENESS IN FACT ANY NEW MATTER IS TRYING TO OLD PEOPLE IT HAS ITS OWN DISTURBANCES AND ITS OWN ANXIETIES AND NEITHER OF THESE THINGS ARE GOOD FOR LIVES THAT SHOULD BE RESTFUL
4078-7619-0006 YOUR UNCLE IS A STRONG MAN WITH A VERY HAPPY AND PLACID NATURE GIVEN HEALTH AND ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF LIFE THERE IS NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED
4078-7619-0007 YOU AND I THEREFORE WHO BOTH LOVE HIM THOUGH IN DIFFERENT WAYS SHOULD MAKE IT OUR BUSINESS TO PROTECT HIM FROM ALL DISTURBING INFLUENCES I AM SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT ANY LABOUR TO THIS END WOULD BE WELL SPENT
4078-7619-0008 ALL RIGHT MY BOY I SEE YOUR ANSWER IN YOUR EYES SO WE NEED SAY NO MORE OF THAT AND NOW HERE HIS VOICE CHANGED
4078-7619-0009 THERE ARE STRANGE THINGS IN FRONT OF US
4078-7619-0010 DOUBTLESS SOME OF THE DIFFICULT THINGS TO UNDERSTAND WHICH LIE BEHIND THE VEIL
4078-7619-0011 IN THE MEANTIME ALL WE CAN DO IS TO WORK PATIENTLY FEARLESSLY AND UNSELFISHLY TO AN END THAT WE THINK IS RIGHT
4078-7619-0012 YOU ALSO OBSERVED THAT MIMI WAS DISTURBED IN HER MIND AT THE WAY MISTER CASWALL LOOKED AT HER COUSIN CERTAINLY THOUGH DISTURBED IS A POOR WAY OF EXPRESSING HER OBJECTION CAN YOU REMEMBER WELL ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE CASWALL'S EYES
4078-7619-0013 AND HOW LILLA LOOKED AND WHAT MIMI SAID AND DID ALSO OOLANGA CASWALL'S WEST AFRICAN SERVANT I'LL DO WHAT I CAN SIR ALL THE TIME MISTER CASWALL WAS STARING HE KEPT HIS EYES FIXED AND MOTIONLESS
4078-7619-0014 BUT NOT AS IF HE WAS IN A TRANCE HIS FOREHEAD WAS WRINKLED UP AS IT IS WHEN ONE IS TRYING TO SEE THROUGH OR INTO SOMETHING AT THE BEST OF TIMES HIS FACE HAS NOT A GENTLE EXPRESSION
4078-7619-0015 BUT WHEN IT WAS SCREWED UP LIKE THAT IT WAS ALMOST DIABOLICAL IT FRIGHTENED POOR LILLA SO THAT SHE TREMBLED AND AFTER A BIT GOT SO PALE THAT I THOUGHT SHE HAD FAINTED HOWEVER SHE HELD UP AND TRIED TO STARE BACK
4078-7619-0016 BUT IN A FEEBLE KIND OF WAY THEN MIMI CAME CLOSE AND HELD HER HAND THAT BRACED HER UP AND STILL NEVER CEASING HER RETURN STARE SHE GOT COLOUR AGAIN AND SEEMED MORE LIKE HERSELF DID HE STARE TOO
4078-7619-0017 MORE THAN EVER THE WEAKER LILLA SEEMED THE STRONGER HE BECAME JUST AS IF HE WERE FEEDING ON HER STRENGTH ALL AT ONCE SHE TURNED ROUND THREW UP HER HANDS AND FELL DOWN IN A FAINT I COULD NOT SEE WHAT ELSE HAPPENED JUST THEN
4078-7619-0018 FOR MIMI HAD THROWN HERSELF ON HER KNEES BESIDE HER AND HID HER FROM ME THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE A BLACK SHADOW BETWEEN US AND THERE WAS THE NIGGER LOOKING MORE LIKE A MALIGNANT DEVIL THAN EVER I AM NOT USUALLY A PATIENT MAN
4078-7619-0019 AND THE SIGHT OF THAT UGLY DEVIL IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE'S BLOOD BOIL WHEN HE SAW MY FACE HE SEEMED TO REALISE DANGER IMMEDIATE DANGER AND SLUNK OUT OF THE ROOM AS NOISELESSLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT I LEARNED ONE THING HOWEVER
4078-7619-0020 HE IS AN ENEMY IF EVER A MAN HAD ONE THAT STILL LEAVES US THREE TO TWO PUT IN SIR NATHANIEL THEN CASWALL SLUNK OUT MUCH AS THE NIGGER HAD DONE WHEN HE HAD GONE LILLA RECOVERED AT ONCE
4078-7619-0021 HAVE YOU FOUND OUT ANYTHING YET REGARDING THE NEGRO I AM ANXIOUS TO BE POSTED REGARDING HIM I FEAR THERE WILL BE OR MAY BE GRAVE TROUBLE WITH HIM YES SIR I'VE HEARD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT HIM OF COURSE IT IS NOT OFFICIAL
4078-7619-0022 BUT HEARSAY MUST GUIDE US AT FIRST YOU KNOW MY MAN DAVENPORT PRIVATE SECRETARY CONFIDENTIAL MAN OF BUSINESS AND GENERAL FACTOTUM HE IS DEVOTED TO ME AND HAS MY FULL CONFIDENCE
4078-7619-0023 I ASKED HIM TO STAY ON BOARD THE WEST AFRICAN AND HAVE A GOOD LOOK ROUND AND FIND OUT WHAT HE COULD ABOUT MISTER CASWALL NATURALLY HE WAS STRUCK WITH THE ABORIGINAL SAVAGE HE FOUND ONE OF THE SHIP'S STEWARDS WHO HAD BEEN ON THE REGULAR VOYAGES TO SOUTH AFRICA
4078-7619-0024 HE KNEW OOLANGA AND HAD MADE A STUDY OF HIM HE IS A MAN WHO GETS ON WELL WITH NIGGERS AND THEY OPEN THEIR HEARTS TO HIM IT SEEMS THAT THIS OOLANGA IS QUITE A GREAT PERSON IN THE NIGGER WORLD OF THE AFRICAN WEST COAST
4078-7619-0025 HE CAN MAKE THEM AFRAID AND HE IS LAVISH WITH MONEY I DON'T KNOW WHOSE MONEY BUT THAT DOES NOT MATTER THEY ARE ALWAYS READY TO TRUMPET HIS GREATNESS EVIL GREATNESS IT IS BUT NEITHER DOES THAT MATTER BRIEFLY THIS IS HIS HISTORY
4078-7619-0026 HE WAS ORIGINALLY A WITCH FINDER ABOUT AS LOW AN OCCUPATION AS EXISTS AMONGST ABORIGINAL SAVAGES THEN HE GOT UP IN THE WORLD AND BECAME AN OBI MAN WHICH GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEALTH VIA BLACKMAIL
4078-7619-0027 FINALLY HE REACHED THE HIGHEST HONOUR IN HELLISH SERVICE HE BECAME A USER OF VOODOO WHICH SEEMS TO BE A SERVICE OF THE UTMOST BASENESS AND CRUELTY I WAS TOLD SOME OF HIS DEEDS OF CRUELTY WHICH ARE SIMPLY SICKENING
4078-7619-0028 OF HELPING TO DRIVE HIM BACK TO HELL YOU MIGHT THINK TO LOOK AT HIM THAT YOU COULD MEASURE IN SOME WAY THE EXTENT OF HIS VILENESS BUT IT WOULD BE A VAIN HOPE MONSTERS SUCH AS HE IS BELONG TO AN EARLIER AND MORE RUDIMENTARY STAGE OF BARBARISM
4078-7619-0029 HE IS IN HIS WAY A CLEVER FELLOW FOR A NIGGER BUT IS NONE THE LESS DANGEROUS OR THE LESS HATEFUL FOR THAT THE MEN IN THE SHIP TOLD ME THAT HE WAS A COLLECTOR SOME OF THEM HAD SEEN HIS COLLECTIONS SUCH COLLECTIONS
4078-7619-0030 ALL THAT WAS POTENT FOR EVIL IN BIRD OR BEAST OR EVEN IN FISH BEAKS THAT COULD BREAK AND REND AND TEAR ALL THE BIRDS REPRESENTED WERE OF A PREDATORY KIND EVEN THE FISHES ARE THOSE WHICH ARE BORN TO DESTROY
4078-7619-0031 TO WOUND TO TORTURE THE COLLECTION I ASSURE YOU WAS AN OBJECT LESSON IN HUMAN MALIGNITY THIS BEING HAS ENOUGH EVIL IN HIS FACE TO FRIGHTEN EVEN A STRONG MAN IT IS LITTLE WONDER THAT THE SIGHT OF IT PUT THAT POOR GIRL
4078-7619-0032 INTO A DEAD FAINT NOTHING MORE COULD BE DONE AT THE MOMENT SO THEY SEPARATED
4078-7619-0033 AND TOOK A SMART WALK ROUND THE BROW AS HE WAS PASSING DIANA'S GROVE HE LOOKED IN ON THE SHORT AVENUE OF TREES
4078-7619-0034 THEY ALL LAY IN A ROW STRAIGHT AND RIGID AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PLACED BY HANDS THEIR SKINS SEEMED DAMP AND STICKY AND THEY WERE COVERED ALL OVER WITH ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS THEY LOOKED LOATHSOME SO AFTER A GLANCE
4078-7619-0035 HE PASSED ON A LITTLE LATER WHEN HIS STEPS TOOK HIM NATURALLY ENOUGH
4078-7619-0036 HE WAS PASSED BY THE NEGRO MOVING QUICKLY UNDER THE TREES WHEREVER THERE WAS SHADOW LAID ACROSS ONE EXTENDED ARM
4078-7619-0037 HE HAD THE HORRID LOOKING SNAKES HE DID NOT SEEM TO SEE ADAM NO ONE WAS TO BE SEEN AT MERCY EXCEPT A FEW WORKMEN IN THE FARMYARD SO AFTER WAITING ON THE CHANCE OF SEEING MIMI ADAM BEGAN TO GO SLOWLY HOME
4078-7619-0038 ONCE MORE HE WAS PASSED ON THE WAY THIS TIME IT WAS BY LADY ARABELLA WALKING HURRIEDLY AND SO FURIOUSLY ANGRY THAT SHE DID NOT RECOGNISE HIM EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF ACKNOWLEDGING HIS BOW
4078-7619-0039 WHEN ADAM GOT BACK TO LESSER HILL HE WENT TO THE COACH HOUSE WHERE THE BOX WITH THE MONGOOSE WAS KEPT AND TOOK IT WITH HIM INTENDING TO FINISH AT THE MOUND OF STONE WHAT HE HAD BEGUN THE PREVIOUS MORNING
4078-7619-0040 WITH REGARD TO THE EXTERMINATION HE FOUND THAT THE SNAKES WERE EVEN MORE EASILY ATTACKED THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY NO LESS THAN SIX WERE KILLED IN THE FIRST HALF HOUR AS NO MORE APPEARED
4078-7619-0041 HE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE MORNING'S WORK WAS OVER AND WENT TOWARDS HOME THE MONGOOSE HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO HIM AND WAS WILLING TO LET HIMSELF BE HANDLED FREELY ADAM LIFTED HIM UP AND PUT HIM ON HIS SHOULDER
4078-7619-0042 AND WALKED ON PRESENTLY HE SAW A LADY ADVANCING TOWARDS HIM AND RECOGNISED LADY ARABELLA HITHERTO THE MONGOOSE HAD BEEN QUIET LIKE A PLAYFUL AFFECTIONATE KITTEN BUT WHEN THE TWO GOT CLOSE
4078-7619-0043 ADAM WAS HORRIFIED TO SEE THE MONGOOSE IN A STATE OF THE WILDEST FURY WITH EVERY HAIR STANDING ON END JUMP FROM HIS SHOULDER AND RUN TOWARDS LADY ARABELLA IT LOOKED SO FURIOUS AND SO INTENT ON ATTACK
4078-7619-0044 THAT HE CALLED A WARNING LOOK OUT LOOK OUT THE ANIMAL IS FURIOUS AND MEANS TO ATTACK LADY ARABELLA LOOKED MORE THAN EVER DISDAINFUL AND WAS PASSING ON THE MONGOOSE JUMPED AT HER IN A FURIOUS ATTACK
4078-7619-0045 ADAM RUSHED FORWARD WITH HIS STICK THE ONLY WEAPON HE HAD BUT JUST AS HE GOT WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE THE LADY DREW OUT A REVOLVER AND SHOT THE ANIMAL BREAKING HIS BACKBONE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS SHE POURED SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO HIM
4078-7619-0046 TILL THE MAGAZINE WAS EXHAUSTED THERE WAS NO COOLNESS OR HAUTEUR ABOUT HER NOW SHE SEEMED MORE FURIOUS EVEN THAN THE ANIMAL HER FACE TRANSFORMED WITH HATE AND AS DETERMINED TO KILL AS HE HAD APPEARED TO BE
4078-7619-0047 ADAM NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT TO DO LIFTED HIS HAT IN APOLOGY
