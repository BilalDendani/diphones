4243-187023-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT CHRIS AND AMOS LAY BELLY DOWN IN A LOW CLUMP OF PINE SCRUB AT THE TOP OF A PRECIPITOUS ROCKY PINNACLE BELOW THEM IN THE BLISTERING NOON LAY THE PALACE WALLS OF THE LORD OF THE SEVEN SEAS
4243-187023-0001 DESCENDANT OF THE SUN AND THE MOON OVERLORD OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THE PLAINS PRINCE OF ALL THE ISLES FATHER OF PLENTY AND BRILLIANCE BEFORE WHICH ALL CAST DOWN THEIR EYES THE EMPEROR OF CHINA
4243-187023-0002 THE TWO BOYS WERE UNINTERESTED IN TITLES SOMEWHERE WITHIN THAT CITY WITHIN A CITY INSIDE THE ENORMOUS SPREAD OF THE PALACE WALLS THAT WERE SURROUNDED IN THEIR TURN BY THE CITY OF PEKING LAY THE GOAL THEY HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK
4243-187023-0003 THE JEWEL TREE OF THE PRINCESS OF CHINA NOW LIKE A GENERAL PLANNING HIS CAMPAIGN CHRIS LAY LOOKING DOWN AT THE HIGH ANGULAR WALLS THINKING OF HOW HE WOULD GAIN ENTRY ON REGAINING THE MIRABELLE IN A BOAT MADE FROM THE MAGIC ROPE
4243-187023-0004 CHRIS HAD REAPPEARED AMONG HIS FRIENDS RECOVERED FROM HIS FEVER HE HAD GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT TO WHAT HE CONSIDERED WOULD BE THE LAST DANGEROUS SECTION OF THE JOURNEY AND AFTER LISTENING TO WHAT HIS MASTER SAID THROUGH THE SHELL
4243-187023-0005 A CAMEL MADE FROM THE MAGIC ROPE AS AMOS HAD NEVER SEEN A REAL CAMEL HE THOUGHT THE ROPE ANIMAL QUITE NATURAL AND AS REMARKABLE A CREATURE AS A REAL ONE CHRIS TOOK CARE TO MAKE IT OR DISENTANGLE IT
4243-187023-0006 OUT OF AMOS'S SIGHT AND SO MANY WERE THE STRANGE AND WONDERFUL THINGS TO BE SEEN THAT AMOS HAD NO TIME TO CONCERN HIMSELF OVER THE REALITY OF A CAMEL THE ARID COUNTRYSIDE WAS BLANCHED BY THE EXCESSIVE HEAT
4243-187023-0007 FLIES DRONED OVER THE DATES AND FIGS THAT THE BOYS PULLED FROM THEIR POCKETS TO EAT AMOS WRIGGLED WITH EXCITEMENT AS HE POINTED OUT DETAILS TO CHRIS CHRIS LOOK AT THAT PROCESSION GOING IN THE BIG GATE
4243-187023-0008 ALL THOSE PIGTAILED GENTLEMEN DRESSED IN EMBROIDERED COATS I LIKE THAT BLUE ONE WITH BUTTERFLIES ON IT NO I'D SOONER HAVE THE BLACK SATIN ONE WITH THE DRAGON IN RED AND YELLOW HE LOOKED AGAIN MORE CLOSELY OR THE ONE WITH THE PEACOCK IN GREEN AND PURPLE
4243-187023-0009 WHICH WOULD YOU SOONER HAVE CHRIS PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO AMOS'S EXCLAMATIONS LEANING ON HIS ELBOWS AND LOOKING AT THE SCENE BELOW HIS MIND WORKED BUSILY ON THESE LAST VITAL PROBLEMS BUT AMOS WAS NOT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER
4243-187023-0010 HATE TO BE A DIGNITARY IN ALL THIS HEAT AMOS SAID UNENVIOUSLY WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW HE ENQUIRED AND BOTH BOYS PARTED THE PRICKLY PINE NEEDLES TO LOOK OUT AND DOWN
4243-187023-0011 THE LEADER OF THE PROCESSION RAPPED THREE TIMES ON THE GREAT GATE WITH A GOLD STAFF SENTINELS AND GUARDS CAME FORWARD WALKING ON THE BROAD GATE TOP AND AFTER TALKING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE PROCESSION
4243-187023-0012 AND THE GREAT OUTER GATES OF THE PALACE STUDDED WITH PRONGED SPIKES OF CARVED METAL SWUNG SLOWLY OUTWARD SIXTEEN MEN CAME INTO SIGHT EIGHT ON EITHER SIDE PUSHING WIDE THE GATES
4243-187023-0013 GEE IMAGINE THE WEIGHT OF THOSE DOORS CHRIS MURMURED AND TAKING OUT HIS SPYGLASS LOOKED THROUGH IT GOLLY MOSES HE EXCLAIMED TAKE A LOOK AMOS THOSE GATES ARE MADE OF BRONZE NEARLY THREE FEET THICK
4243-187023-0014 AND NOW THEY HAVE THE GATES OPEN LOOK AT THE DEPTH OF THE WALLS THEY'RE AS DEEP THROUGH AS A ROOM THE WAITING PROCESSION THE RICHLY DRESSED COURTIERS AND CURTAINED PALANQUIN MOVED INSIDE AND THE GATES WERE SLOWLY PULLED CLOSE BY LINES OF MEN
4243-187023-0015 DRAGGING AT ROPES AND CHAINS TO SHUT THEM FROM WITHIN THE MAIN GATE DRIFTED OUT THE SOUND BECOMING FAINTER AND FAINTER OF OTHER TRUMPETS SOUNDING THE ORDER FOR THE OPENING OF OTHER GATES TEN TIMES THE BOYS COUNTED THE TRUMPETS BLEW
4243-187023-0016 THROBBED AGAINST THE SULTRY AIR LAWSY ME AMOS SIGHED WHEN NO MORE TRUMPETS WERE TO BE HEARD TEN WALLS AND TEN GATES AT THE VERY LEAST COURSE WE DON'T KNOW HE ROLLED HIS WORRIED EYES TOWARD CHRIS
4243-187023-0017 WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THOSE FOLKS GOT TO THE EMPEROR OR NOT LIKELY HE'S IN BEHIND A COUPLE MORE WALLS JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE HE SEARCHED HIS FRIEND'S FACE HOW ARE WE GOING PAST ALL THAT MANY GUARDS AND TRUMPETS CHRIS EVEN IF WE COULD TIE UP A GUARD OR TWO
4243-187023-0018 AMOS NEED NOT HAVE BEEN SO CONCERNED FOR CHRIS HAD A GOOD PLAN BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE HEAT OVERCAME CHRIS PUTTING HIS HEAD DOWN ON HIS ARMS HE SLEPT AMOS SLEPT TOO
4243-187023-0019 AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS LATER THAT THE RISING SOUND OF A CROWD TALKING AND LAUGHING WITH EXCITEMENT PENETRATED THEIR SLEEP AND BROUGHT THEM TO CONSCIOUSNESS FOR A MOMENT THEY BOTH LAY RUBBING THEIR EYES AND PEERING OUT
4243-187023-0020 THEN THEY REALIZED BY THE GROWING CROWD ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PALACE GATE AND ALONG THE NARROW STREET LEADING AWAY FROM IT THAT SOMEONE OF IMPORTANCE WAS ABOUT TO COME FROM THE PALACE AND PARADE THROUGH THE STREETS OF PEKING WONDER WHAT GOES ON
4243-187023-0021 CHRIS MUTTERED AS THE CROWDS BELOW SWELLED AND GREW BOYS CLIMBED UPON ONE ANOTHER'S SHOULDERS TEAKWOOD STOOLS WERE BROUGHT FOR THE RICHER PEOPLE TO STAND ON AND ALONG THE STREET THAT LED AWAY TO THE RIGHT AROUND THE PALACE WALLS
4243-187023-0022 CHRIS AND AMOS COULD SEE EMBROIDERED SILKS HUNG FROM ALL THE WINDOWS AND CHINESE PEOPLE IN THEIR BEST HOLIDAY CLOTHES LAUGHING EXCITEDLY ALL WERE LOOKING TOWARD THE GATES AND AT LAST FROM FAR WITHIN
4243-187023-0023 EVEN MORE DISTANTLY THAN BEFORE CAME THE FIRST SOUND OF TRUMPETS THESE HAD A SWEETER CLEARER SOUND THAN THOSE THE BOYS HAD HEARD AT NOON NEVER HEARD A SWEETER NOTE AMOS SAID MIGHT BE MADE OF SILVER WAY THEY SOUND
4243-187023-0024 THE BOYS COUNTED AND TWELVE TIMES THE LOW LOVELY NOTES SWUNG OUT ON THE AIR TWELVE GATES
4243-187023-0025 AND LOOK YOU WERE RIGHT THEY ARE SILVER TRUMPETS THE TRUMPETERS ATOP THE GREAT OUTER GATES WERE NOW DIFFERENTLY DRESSED AND THERE WERE NOT TWO BUT A DOZEN LINED ALONG THE DEEP PALACE WALLS THE TRUMPETS TEN FEET LONG WERE CURVED
4243-187023-0026 AND OF SILVER THAT IN THE SUNLIGHT DAZZLED THE EYE AS THEY WERE BLOWN THE FINAL GATES WERE PUSHED ASIDE A LONG PROCESSION EMERGED OF SUCH FANTASY AND VARIETY OF COLOR THAT THE TWO BOYS WERE SPELLBOUND
4243-187023-0027 ELEPHANTS AND CAMELS LLAMAS AND HORSES ALL RICHLY CAPARISONED IN EASTERN SILKS PASSED ALONG WITH THEIR RIDERS GUARDS WITH CURVED SWORDS AND MANY THONGED WHIPS FORMED A DOUBLE HEDGE BETWEEN THOSE IN THE PROCESSION
4243-187023-0028 AND THE BYSTANDERS STILL OTHERS LED LEOPARDS AND BLACK PANTHERS ON CHAINS AS AN ADDED PROTECTION TO THOSE THEY GUARDED PALANQUIN AFTER PALANQUIN PASSED BY
4243-187023-0029 A MURMUR AROSE FROM THE CROWD FOUR LINES OF YOUTHS PRECEDED A PALANQUIN MORE FINELY DECKED THAN THE REST AND THE MURMUR ROSE AFTER IT CAME FOUR LINES OF CHINESE GIRLS FANNING THE AIR WITH PEACOCK FANS ON LONG STAVES
4243-187023-0030 CHRIS BREATHED THAT COLOR YELLOW IS THE ROYAL COLOR OF CHINA HE DID NOT HAVE TO ELABORATE HIS THOUGHT FOR THE PALANQUIN THAT FINALLY CAME IN SIGHT SHOWED BY ITS RICHNESS THAT IT COULD BELONG ONLY TO ROYALTY AND BY ITS BEAUTY AND GRACE
4243-187023-0031 ONLY TO A WOMAN MADE OF SILVER AND ROCK CRYSTAL STUDDED WITH DIAMONDS AND PEARLS AND HUNG ABOUT WITH SHEER CURTAINS OF EMBROIDERED YELLOW SILK THE PALANQUIN BELONGED WITHOUT DOUBT TO A YOUNG GIRL OF THE ROYAL HOUSE
4243-187023-0032 AS IT APPEARED UNDER THE HIGH ARCH OF THE OUTER GATE A ROAR OF JOY AND GREETING AROSE FROM THE WAITING CROWD AND WITH ONE ACCORD EVERY MAN BOWED LOW COVERING HIS EYES WITH THE WIDE SLEEVE OF HIS LEFT ARM
4243-187023-0033 THE WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE CROWD AND THOSE LEANING FROM THE UPPER STORIES OF THE HOUSES THREW DOWN BEFORE THE PALANQUIN OBJECTS THAT FLASHED AND TWINKLED IN THE SUN
4243-187023-0034 CHRIS WHIPPED OUT HIS SPYGLASS AND LOOKED AT THE CURTAINS OF THE PALANQUIN THE THIN SILK WAS TRANSPARENT ENOUGH UNDER THE STRONG FOCUS OF THE GLASS AND BEHIND IT CHRIS COULD PERCEIVE LEANING DELICATELY AGAINST SILK CUSHIONS A CHINESE GIRL AS BEAUTIFUL AS A DREAM
4243-187023-0035 HER SLIGHTLY UPTILTED EYES WERE LARGE AND DARK HER SKIN PUT A MAGNOLIA FLOWER TO SHAME HER MOUTH WAS LIFTED IN A CHARMING SMILE AND HER LONG EXQUISITE FINGERS HELD A SPRAY OF JEWELED FLOWERS
4243-187023-0036 ALL ABOUT THE PALANQUIN RAINED A SHOWER OF JEWELED BUDS AND PETALS FOR NO DOUBT A REAL FLOWER WAS THOUGHT TOO INFERIOR FOR THE ONLY CHILD OF THE DESCENDANT OF THE SUN AND THE MOON PRINCE OF ALL THE ISLES AND LORD OF THE SEVEN SEAS
