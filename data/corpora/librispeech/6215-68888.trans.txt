6215-68888-0000 ALMOST THE FIRST DECIDED TASTE IN MY LIFE WAS THE LOVE OF HYMNS COMMITTING THEM TO MEMORY WAS AS NATURAL TO ME AS BREATHING I FOLLOWED MY MOTHER ABOUT WITH THE HYMN BOOK WATTS AND SELECT
6215-68888-0001 READING OR REPEATING THEM TO HER WHILE SHE WAS BUSY WITH HER BAKING OR IRONING AND SHE WAS ALWAYS A WILLING LISTENER SHE WAS FOND OF DEVOTIONAL READING BUT HAD LITTLE TIME FOR IT
6215-68888-0002 AND IT PLEASED HER TO KNOW THAT SO SMALL A CHILD AS I REALLY CARED FOR THE HYMNS SHE LOVED I LEARNED MOST OF THEM AT MEETING I WAS TOLD TO LISTEN TO THE MINISTER BUT AS I DID NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD HE WAS SAYING
6215-68888-0003 AND SOMETIMES I LEARNED TWO OR THREE HYMNS IN A FORENOON OR AN AFTERNOON FINDING IT SO EASY I THOUGHT I WOULD BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND LEARN THE WHOLE THERE WERE ABOUT A THOUSAND OF THEM INCLUDED IN THE PSALMS THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD BOOKS AND THE SELECT HYMNS
6215-68888-0004 BUT I HAD LEARNED TO READ BEFORE I HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE OF COUNTING UP NUMBERS AND SO WAS BLISSFULLY IGNORANT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF MY UNDERTAKING I DID NOT I THINK CHANGE MY RESOLUTION BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY BUT BECAUSE LITTLE AS I WAS
6215-68888-0005 I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE HYMNS AND HYMNS SOME OF THEM WERE SO PROSY THAT THE WORDS WOULD NOT STAY IN MY MEMORY AT ALL SO I CONCLUDED THAT I WOULD LEARN ONLY THOSE I LIKED I HAD VARIOUS REASONS FOR MY PREFERENCES
6215-68888-0006 WITH SOME I WAS CAUGHT BY A MELODIOUS ECHO OR A SONOROUS RING WITH OTHERS BY THE HINT OF A PICTURE OR A STORY OR BY SOME SACRED SUGGESTION THAT ATTRACTED ME I KNEW NOT WHY
6215-68888-0007 OF SOME I WAS FOND JUST BECAUSE I MISUNDERSTOOD THEM AND OF THESE I MADE A FREE VERSION IN MY MIND AS I MURMURED THEM OVER ONE OF MY FIRST FAVORITES WAS CERTAINLY RATHER A SINGULAR CHOICE FOR A CHILD OF THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6215-68888-0008 I HAD NO IDEA OF ITS MEANING BUT MADE UP A LITTLE STORY OUT OF IT WITH MYSELF AS THE HEROINE IT BEGAN WITH THE WORDS COME HUMBLE SINNER IN WHOSE BREAST A THOUSAND THOUGHTS REVOLVE THE SECOND STANZA READ THUS
6215-68888-0009 I'LL GO TO JESUS THOUGH MY SIN HATH LIKE A MOUNTAIN ROSE I DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS LAST LINE WAS BAD GRAMMAR BUT THOUGHT THAT THE SIN IN QUESTION WAS SOMETHING PRETTY THAT LOOKED LIKE A MOUNTAIN ROSE MOUNTAINS I HAD NEVER SEEN
6215-68888-0010 THEY WERE A GLORIOUS DREAM TO ME AND A ROSE THAT GREW ON A MOUNTAIN MUST SURELY BE PRETTIER THAN ANY OF OUR RED WILD ROSES ON THE HILL SWEET AS THEY WERE I WOULD PLUCK THAT ROSE AND CARRY IT UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE INTO THE TEMPLE
6215-68888-0011 WHERE THE KING SAT AND WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM AND THEN HE WOULD TOUCH ME WITH HIS SCEPTRE AND LET ME THROUGH INTO A GARDEN FULL OF FLOWERS THERE WAS NO GARDEN IN THE HYMN I SUPPOSE THE ROSE MADE ME INVENT ONE BUT IT DID READ
6215-68888-0012 WHATEVER MAY OPPOSE AND SO I FANCIED THERE WOULD BE LIONS IN THE WAY AS THERE WERE IN THE PILGRIM'S AT THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL BUT I SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF THEM THEY WOULD NO DOUBT BE CHAINED
6215-68888-0013 AND MY HEART BEAT A BRAVE ECHO TO THE WORDS AS I STARTED OFF IN FANCY ON A PILGRIM'S PROGRESS OF MY OWN A HAPPY LITTLE DREAMER TELLING NOBODY THE SECRET OF MY IMAGINARY JOURNEY TAKEN IN SERMON TIME
6215-68888-0014 USUALLY THE HYMNS FOR WHICH I CARED MOST SUGGESTED NATURE IN SOME WAY FLOWERS TREES SKIES AND STARS WHEN I REPEATED THERE EVERLASTING SPRING ABIDES AND NEVER WITHERING FLOWERS
6215-68888-0015 THE DEAR LITTLE SHORT LIVED CHILDREN OF OUR SHIVERING SPRING THEY ALSO WOULD SURELY BE FOUND IN THAT HEAVENLY LAND BLOOMING ON THROUGH THE CLOUDLESS ENDLESS YEAR
6215-68888-0016 THE HILL OF ZION YIELDS A THOUSAND SACRED SWEET BEFORE WE REACH THE HEAVENLY FIELDS OR WALK THE GOLDEN STREETS WE WERE ALLOWED TO TAKE A LITTLE NOSEGAY TO MEETING SOMETIMES A PINK OR TWO
6215-68888-0017 I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW A WORLD COULD BE BEAUTIFUL WHERE THERE WAS NO MORE SEA
6215-68888-0018 ONE STANZA THAT I USED TO CROON OVER GAVE ME THE FEELING OF BEING ROCKED IN A BOAT ON A STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL OCEAN FROM WHOSE FAR OFF SHORES THE SUNRISE BECKONED AT ANCHOR LAID REMOTE FROM HOME
6215-68888-0019 TOILING I CRY SWEET SPIRIT COME CELESTIAL BREEZE NO LONGER STAY BUT SPREAD MY SAILS AND SPEED MY WAY SOME OF THE CHOSEN HYMNS OF MY INFANCY THE WORLD RECOGNIZES AMONG ITS NOBLEST TREASURES OF SACRED SONG
6215-68888-0020 THAT ONE OF DODDRIDGE'S BEGINNING WITH YE GOLDEN LAMPS OF HEAVEN FAREWELL MADE ME FEEL AS IF I HAD JUST BEEN GAZING IN AT SOME WINDOW OF THE MANY MANSIONS ABOVE YE STARS ARE BUT THE SHINING DUST OF MY DIVINE ABODE
6215-68888-0021 HAD I NOT KNOWN THAT EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY BUT THE LIGHT DOES NOT STREAM DOWN EVEN INTO A BABY'S SOUL WITH EQUAL BRIGHTNESS ALL THE TIME EARTH DRAWS HER DARK CURTAINS TOO SOON OVER THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN
6215-68888-0022 AND UNDERSTOOD AS LITTLE AS THE THUNDER ITSELF WHICH MY MOTHER TOLD ME WAS GOD'S VOICE SO THAT I BENT MY EAR AND LISTENED EXPECTING TO HEAR IT SHAPED INTO WORDS IT STILL DID GIVE ME AN IDEA OF THE PRESENCE OF ONE INFINITE BEING
6215-68888-0023 THAT THRILLED ME WITH REVERENT AWE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST LESSONS TAUGHT IN THE PURITAN SCHOOL THE LESSON OF REVERENCE THE CERTAINTY THAT LIFE MEANT LOOKING UP TO SOMETHING TO SOME ONE GREATER THAN OURSELVES
6215-68888-0024 TO A LIFE FAR ABOVE US WHICH YET ENFOLDED OURS THE THOUGHT OF GOD WHEN HE WAS FIRST SPOKEN OF TO ME SEEMED AS NATURAL AS THE THOUGHT OF MY FATHER AND MOTHER THAT HE SHOULD BE INVISIBLE DID NOT SEEM STRANGE
6215-68888-0025 AND IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TEXTS HEAVEN SEEMED NEARER BECAUSE SOMEBODY I LOVED WAS UP THERE LOOKING AT ME A BABY IS NOT AFRAID OF ITS FATHER'S EYES THE FIRST REAL UNHAPPINESS I REMEMBER TO HAVE FELT
6215-68888-0026 WAS WHEN SOME ONE TOLD ME ONE DAY THAT I DID NOT LOVE GOD I INSISTED ALMOST TEARFULLY THAT I DID BUT I WAS TOLD THAT IF I DID TRULY LOVE HIM I SHOULD ALWAYS BE GOOD I KNEW I WAS NOT THAT
6215-68888-0027 AND THE FEELING OF SUDDEN ORPHANAGE CAME OVER ME LIKE A BEWILDERING CLOUD YET I WAS SURE THAT I LOVED MY FATHER AND MOTHER EVEN WHEN I WAS NAUGHTY WAS HE HARDER TO PLEASE THAN THEY THEN I HEARD OF A DREADFUL DARK SOMEWHERE
6215-68888-0028 THE HORROR OF WHICH WAS THAT IT WAS AWAY FROM HIM WHAT IF I SHOULD WAKE SOME MORNING AND FIND MYSELF THERE SOMETIMES I DID NOT DARE TO GO TO SLEEP FOR THAT DREAD AND THE THOUGHT WAS TOO AWFUL TO SPEAK OF TO ANYBODY
6215-68888-0029 BABY THAT I WAS I SHUT MY LIPS IN A SORT OF RECKLESS DESPAIR AND THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD NOT BE GOOD I MIGHT AS WELL BE NAUGHTY AND ENJOY IT BUT SOMEHOW I COULD NOT ENJOY IT I FELT SORRY AND ASHAMED AND DEGRADED
6215-68888-0030 WHENEVER I KNEW THAT I HAD BEEN CROSS OR SELFISH I HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT JESUS AS IF HE WERE A DEAD MAN ONE WHO DIED A GREAT WHILE AGO WHOSE DEATH MADE A GREAT DIFFERENCE TO US I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW
6215-68888-0031 IT SEEMED LIKE A LOVELY STORY THE LOVELIEST IN THE WORLD
6215-68888-0032 SOMETHING THAT HAD HAPPENED FAR AWAY IN THE PAST BUT ONE DAY A STRANGE MINISTER CAME INTO THE SABBATH SCHOOL IN OUR LITTLE CHAPEL AND SPOKE TO US CHILDREN ABOUT HIM OH SO DIFFERENTLY CHILDREN HE SAID JESUS IS NOT DEAD HE IS ALIVE
6215-68888-0033 HE LOVES YOU AND WANTS YOU TO LOVE HIM HE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND AND HE WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO BE GOOD MY HEART BEAT FAST I COULD HARDLY KEEP BACK THE TEARS THE NEW TESTAMENT THEN DID REALLY MEAN WHAT IT SAID
6215-68888-0034 JESUS SAID HE WOULD COME BACK AGAIN AND WOULD ALWAYS BE WITH THOSE WHO LOVED HIM HE IS ALIVE HE LOVES ME HE WILL TELL ME HOW TO BE GOOD I SAID IT OVER TO MYSELF BUT NOT TO ANYBODY ELSE I WAS SURE THAT I LOVED HIM
6215-68888-0035 IT WAS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL SECRET BETWEEN US TWO I FELT HIM SO ALIVE AND SO NEAR HE WANTED ME TO BE GOOD AND I COULD BE I WOULD BE FOR HIS SAKE THAT STRANGER NEVER KNEW HOW HIS LOVING WORD HAD TOUCHED A CHILD'S HEART
6215-68888-0036 THE DOORS OF THE FATHER'S HOUSE WERE OPENED WIDE AGAIN BY THE ONLY HAND THAT HOLDS THE KEY THE WORLD WAS ALL BRIGHT AND FRESH ONCE MORE IT WAS AS IF THE MAY SUN HAD SUDDENLY WAKENED THE FLOWERS IN AN OVERSHADOWED WAYSIDE NOOK
6215-68888-0037 I TRIED LONG AFTERWARD THINKING THAT IT WAS MY DUTY TO BUILD UP A WALL OF DIFFICULT DOCTRINES OVER MY SPRING BLOSSOMS AS IF THEY NEEDED PROTECTION BUT THE SWEET LIGHT WAS NEVER WHOLLY STIFLED OUT
6215-68888-0038 THOUGH I DID NOT ALWAYS KEEP MY FACE TURNED TOWARDS IT AND I KNOW NOW THAT JUST TO LET HIS LIFEGIVING SMILE SHINE INTO THE SOUL IS BETTER THAN ANY OF THE THEORIES WE CAN INVENT ABOUT HIM
6215-68888-0039 AND THAT ONLY SO CAN YOUNG OR OLD RECEIVE THE KINGDOM OF GOD AS A LITTLE CHILD I BELIEVE THAT ONE GREAT REASON FOR A CHILD'S LOVE OF HYMNS SUCH AS MINE WAS IS THAT THEY ARE EITHER ADDRESSED TO A PERSON
6215-68888-0040 I THINK MORE GRATEFULLY NOW OF THE VERSES I LEARNED FROM THE BIBLE AND THE HYMN BOOK THAN OF ALMOST ANYTHING THAT CAME TO ME IN THAT TIME OF BEGINNINGS THE WHOLE HYMN BOOK WAS NOT FOR ME THEN ANY MORE THAN THE WHOLE BIBLE
