2388-153733-0000 COME OUTSIDE AND LOOK AT THE SKY
2388-153733-0001 WE WERE DUMBFOUNDED TO SEE THE HEAVENS FILLED WITH PALE FLAMES WHICH RAN LICKING AND QUIVERING OVER THE STARS INSTANTLY THERE SPRANG INTO MY TERRIFIED MIND THE RECOLLECTION OF AN AWFUL DESCRIPTION OF
2388-153733-0002 DREADFULLY IN EARNEST PREACHER OF THE OLD FASHIONED TYPE MY HEART LITERALLY SANK AT SIGHT OF THE SPECTACLE
2388-153733-0003 WHEN MENACING SPOTS OF CRIMSON APPEARED BREAKING OUT NOW HERE NOW THERE IN THE SHUDDERING SKY TOWARD THE NORTH THE SPECTACLE WAS APPALLING A HUGE ARCH SPANNED AN UNNATURALLY DARK SEGMENT RESTING ON THE HORIZON AND ABOVE THIS ARCH
2388-153733-0004 SPRANG UP BEAMS AND STREAMERS IN A STATE OF INCESSANT AGITATION SOMETIMES SHOOTING UP TO THE ZENITH WITH A VELOCITY THAT TOOK ONE'S BREATH AND SOMETIMES SUDDENLY FALLING INTO LONG RANKS AND MARCHING MARCHING MARCHING
2388-153733-0005 OR WERE SHAKEN TO AND FRO AS IF BY A MIGHTY NOISELESS WIND
2388-153733-0006 IS SELDOM SEEN WITH SO MUCH SPLENDOR I REMEMBER ANOTHER SIMILAR ONE SEEN FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO ON THIS LAST OCCASION SOME OBSERVERS SAW A GREAT UPRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT WHICH MAJESTICALLY MOVED ACROSS THE HEAVENS
2388-153733-0007 STALKING LIKE AN APPARITION IN THE MIDST
2388-153733-0008 OF WHOSE GENERAL MOVEMENTS IT SEEMED TO BE INDEPENDENT MAINTAINING ALWAYS ITS UPRIGHT POSTURE AND FOLLOWING A MAGNETIC PARALLEL FROM EAST TO WEST THIS MYSTERIOUS BEAM WAS SEEN BY NO LESS THAN TWENTY SIX OBSERVERS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
2388-153733-0009 INDICATING THAT THE APPARITION WAS ABOUT
2388-153733-0010 WHEN FOR MONTHS TOGETHER THE SUN DOES NOT RISE THE STRANGE CORUSCATIONS IN THE SKY OFTEN AFFORD A KIND OF SPECTRAL DAYLIGHT IN UNISON WITH THE WEIRD SCENERY OF THE WORLD OF ICE THE PAGES IN THE NARRATIVES OF ARCTIC EXPLORATION
2388-153733-0011 THAT ARE DEVOTED TO DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WONDERFUL EFFECTS OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS ARE SECOND TO NONE THAT MAN HAS EVER PENNED IN THEIR FASCINATION THE LIGHTS AS I HAVE ALREADY INTIMATED DISPLAY ASTONISHING COLORS PARTICULARLY SHADES OF RED AND GREEN
2388-153733-0012 THE DISCOVERY THAT THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE IS AFFECTED BY THE AURORA QUIVERING AND DARTING ABOUT IN A STATE OF EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE PLAYING IN THE SKY ONLY ADDED TO THE MYSTERY OF THE PHENOMENON UNTIL ITS ELECTRO MAGNETIC NATURE HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED
2388-153733-0013 THIS BECAME EVIDENT AS SOON AS IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE FOCUS OF THE DISPLAYS WAS THE MAGNETIC POLE AND WHEN THE FAR SOUTH WAS VISITED THE AURORA AUSTRALIS WAS FOUND HAVING ITS CENTER AT THE SOUTH MAGNETIC POLE THEN
2388-153733-0014 IF NOT BEFORE IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE EARTH WAS A GREAT GLOBULAR MAGNET HAVING ITS POLES OF OPPOSITE MAGNETISM AND THAT THE AURORAL LIGHTS WHATEVER THEIR PRECISE CAUSE MIGHT BE WERE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY OF OUR PLANET
2388-153733-0015 AND THE OCEAN CABLES CEASED TO WORK
2388-153733-0016 THE ANCIENT ZURICH CHRONICLES EXTENDING FROM THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED IN WHICH BOTH SUN SPOTS VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE
2388-153733-0017 TWO INTENSELY BRILLIANT POINTS SUDDENLY BROKE OUT IN A GROUP OF SUN SPOTS WHICH WERE UNDER OBSERVATION BY MISTER R C CARRINGTON AT HIS OBSERVATORY AT REDHILL ENGLAND THE POINTS REMAINED VISIBLE FOR NOT MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES DURING WHICH INTERVAL
2388-153733-0018 THEY MOVED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES ACROSS THE SOLAR DISK MISTER R HODGSON HAPPENED TO SEE THE SAME PHENOMENON AT HIS OBSERVATORY AT HIGHGATE AND THUS ALL POSSIBILITY OF DECEPTION WAS REMOVED
2388-153733-0019 HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
2388-153733-0020 TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION WAS EVERYWHERE INTERRUPTED EXCEPT INDEED THAT IT WAS IN SOME CASES FOUND PRACTICABLE TO WORK THE LINES WITHOUT BATTERIES BY THE AGENCY OF THE EARTH CURRENTS ALONE
2388-153733-0021 SPARKS ISSUED FROM THE WIRES GORGEOUS AURORAS DRAPED THE SKIES IN SOLEMN CRIMSON OVER BOTH HEMISPHERES AND EVEN IN THE TROPICS THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE LOST ALL TRACE OF CONTINUITY IN ITS MOVEMENTS AND DARTED TO AND FRO AS IF STRICKEN WITH INEXPLICABLE PANIC
2388-153733-0022 THE COINCIDENCE WAS EVEN CLOSER AT THE VERY INSTANT OF THE SOLAR OUTBURST WITNESSED BY CARRINGTON AND HODGSON THE PHOTOGRAPHIC APPARATUS AT KEW REGISTERED A MARKED DISTURBANCE
2388-153733-0023 WHILE SHORTLY AFTER THE ENSUING MIDNIGHT THE ELECTRIC AGITATION CULMINATED
2388-153733-0024 AND LIGHTING UP THE ATMOSPHERE FROM POLE TO POLE WITH CORUSCATING SPLENDORS WHICH PERHAPS DIMLY RECALL THE TIMES WHEN OUR ANCIENT PLANET ITSELF SHONE AS A STAR
2388-153733-0025 OF THE ASSUMED CONNECTION BETWEEN SOLAR OUTBURSTS AND MAGNETIC STORMS ACCOMPANIED BY AURORAL DISPLAYS ON THE EARTH IT IS TRUE THAT THE LATE LORD KELVIN RAISED DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF A DIRECT MAGNETIC ACTION OF THE SUN UPON THE EARTH
2388-153733-0026 BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT AN INADMISSIBLE QUANTITY OF ENERGY WAS DEMANDED TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH ACTION BUT NO CALCULATION LIKE THAT
2388-153733-0027 IS FINAL SINCE ALL CALCULATIONS DEPEND UPON THE VALIDITY OF THE DATA AND NO AUTHORITY IS UNSHAKABLE IN SCIENCE BECAUSE NO MAN CAN POSSESS OMNISCIENCE IT WAS LORD KELVIN WHO BUT A FEW YEARS BEFORE THE THING WAS ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED
2388-153733-0028 DECLARED THAT AERIAL NAVIGATION WAS AN IMPRACTICABLE DREAM AND DEMONSTRATED ITS IMPRACTICABILITY BY CALCULATION HOWEVER THE CONNECTION MAY BE BROUGHT ABOUT
2388-153733-0029 AND COINCIDENT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE THE INFERENCE
2388-153733-0030 SHOULD IT BE SO DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE SUN'S ENORMOUS ELECTRIC ENERGIES FIND A WAY TO US ALSO NO DOUBT THE IMPULSE COMING FROM THE SUN
2388-153733-0031 FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE SUN SPOT PERIOD SHORTENS THE AURORAL PERIOD SHORTENS TO PRECISELY THE SAME EXTENT AS THE SHORT SUN SPOT PERIODS USUALLY BRING THE MOST INTENSE OUTBREAKS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY SO THE CORRESPONDING SHORT AURORAL PERIODS
2388-153733-0032 ARE ATTENDED BY THE MOST VIOLENT MAGNETIC STORMS A SECULAR PERIOD OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO YEARS AFFECTING SUN SPOTS IS SAID TO HAVE ITS AURORAL DUPLICATE A SHORTER PERIOD OF FIFTY FIVE AND A HALF YEARS
2388-153733-0033 THEY BEGIN TO DESCEND WITH THE LINES OF FORCE CURVING DOWN TO MEET AT THE POLES AND ENCOUNTERING A PART OF THE ATMOSPHERE COMPARABLE IN DENSITY
2388-153733-0034 THEY PRODUCE A GLOW OF CATHODE RAYS THIS GLOW IS CONCEIVED TO REPRESENT THE AURORA WHICH MAY CONSEQUENTLY BE LIKENED TO A GIGANTIC EXHIBITION OF VACUUM TUBE LIGHTS ANYBODY WHO RECALLS HIS STUDENT DAYS IN THE COLLEGE LABORATORY
2388-153733-0035 AND WHO HAS WITNESSED A DISPLAY OF NORTHERN LIGHTS
2388-153733-0036 BEFORE ARRHENIUS ELABORATED HIS HYPOTHESIS WITHOUT INTENDING TO TREAT HIS INTERESTING THEORY AS MORE THAN A POSSIBLY CORRECT EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF THE AURORA WE MAY CALL ATTENTION TO SOME APPARENTLY CONFIRMATORY FACTS
2388-153733-0037 AND FEWER IN JUNE AND DECEMBER
2388-153733-0038 THUS ONE THE PARTICLES ISSUING FROM THE SUN ARE SUPPOSED TO COME PRINCIPALLY FROM THE REGIONS WHOSE EXCITEMENT IS INDICATED BY THE PRESENCE OF SUN SPOTS
2388-153733-0039 THAT SUN SPOTS ARE COLUMNS OF IONIZED VAPORS
2388-153733-0040 THE EARTH IS DIRECTLY OVER THE SOLAR EQUATOR
2388-153733-0041 THIS AS WILL BE SEEN FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE IS IN STRICT ACCORD WITH THE OBSERVED VARIATIONS IN THE FREQUENCY OF AURORAE
2388-153733-0042 IN THE WINTER THAN IN THE SUMMER AND THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES REACHING IT WILL VARY LIKE THE INTENSITY OF LIGHT
2388-153733-0043 THE EARTH IS NEVER DIRECTLY OVER THE MOST ACTIVE REGIONS OF THE SUN SPOTS AND CONSEQUENTLY NEVER SUFFERS FROM THE MAXIMUM BOMBARDMENT OF CHARGED PARTICLES OF WHICH THE SUN IS CAPABLE INCESSANT AURORAL DISPLAYS
2388-153733-0044 FOR MONTHS ON END CRAZING THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE AND CONTINUALLY PUTTING THE TELEGRAPH AND CABLE LINES OUT OF COMMISSION TO SAY NOTHING OF THEIR EFFECT UPON WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY WOULD HARDLY ADD TO THE CHARMS OF TERRESTRIAL EXISTENCE
2388-153733-0045 FIRST THE NUMBER OF AURORAE ACCORDING TO HIS EXPLANATION
2388-153733-0046 SINCE THE LIGHT OF THE AURORA IS NEVER SUFFICIENTLY INTENSE TO BE VISIBLE IN THE PRESENCE OF DAYLIGHT BUT THE RECORDS OF THE MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES CAN BE AND HAVE BEEN APPEALED TO FOR INFORMATION AND THEY INDICATE THAT THE FACTS ACTUALLY ACCORD WITH THE THEORY
2388-153733-0047 BEFORE THAN AFTER MIDNIGHT
2388-153733-0048 IS MORE FREQUENT IN YEARS WHEN AURORAE ARE MOST ABUNDANT
2388-153733-0049 IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN AN ABSOLUTELY DUSTLESS ATMOSPHERE
2388-153733-0050 LIKE THOSE SUPPOSED TO COME FROM THE SUN PLAY A MASTER PART IN THE PHENOMENA OF CLOUD FORMATION YET ANOTHER SINGULAR FACT ALMOST MYSTICAL IN ITS SUGGESTIONS MAY BE MENTIONED
2388-153733-0051 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS
2388-153733-0052 WE SHALL HOWEVER FIND ONE MORE APPLICATION OF IT IN THE NEXT CHAPTER
