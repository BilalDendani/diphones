707-161166-0000 WHAT THE FROST GIANTS DID TO NANNIE'S RUN THE FROST GIANTS DO YOU BELIEVE IN GIANTS NO DO YOU SAY WELL LISTEN TO MY STORY WHICH IS A REALLY TRUE ONE AND THEN ANSWER MY QUESTION
707-161166-0001 MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE NORTH AND WERE THEREFORE CALLED NORTHMEN HAD A STRANGE IDEA OF THE FORM AND SITUATION OF THE EARTH THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A FLAT CIRCULAR PIECE OF LAND SURROUNDED BY A GREAT OCEAN
707-161166-0002 AND THAT THIS OCEAN WAS AGAIN SURROUNDED BY A WALL OF SNOW COVERED MOUNTAINS WHERE LIVED THE RACE OF FROST GIANTS I HAVE SEEN A PRETTY PICTURE OF THIS WORLD OF THEIRS WITH A LOVELY RAINBOW BRIDGE ARCHING UP OVER THE SEA TO THE EARTH
707-161166-0003 AND A GREAT COILED SERPENT HOLDING HIS TAIL IN HIS MOUTH LYING IN MID OCEAN LIKE A RING AROUND THE LAND PERHAPS YOU WILL SOME DAY READ ABOUT IT ALL
707-161166-0004 WE HAVE ONLY TO DO WITH THE FROST GIANTS FOR I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT ALTHOUGH NO ONE NOW THINKS OF BELIEVING ABOUT THE SERPENT OR THE FLAT EARTH OR THE RAINBOW BRIDGE YET THE FROST GIANTS STILL LIVE
707-161166-0005 AND THEIR HOME IS REALLY AMONG THE MOUNTAINS YOU MAY CALL THEM BY WHAT NAME YOU LIKE AND WE MAY ALL KNOW CERTAINLY THAT THEY ARE NOT WHAT THE OLD NORTHMEN BELIEVED THEM TO BE BUT ARE GOD'S WORKMEN A PART OF NATURE'S FAMILY
707-161166-0006 EMPLOYED TO WORK IN THE GREAT GARDEN OF THE WORLD BUT WHENEVER WE LOOK AT THEIR WORK WE CANNOT FAIL TO ADMIT THAT TO DO IT NEEDED A GIANT'S STRENGTH AND SO THEY DESERVE THEIR TITLE
707-161166-0007 AS BIG AS A SMALL HOUSE THAT STAND ALONE BY THEMSELVES IN SOME FIELD OR ON SOME SEASHORE WHERE NO OTHER ROCKS ARE NEAR WELL THE FROST GIANTS CARRIED THESE BOULDERS ABOUT
707-161166-0008 AND DROPPED THEM DOWN MILES AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES AS YOU MIGHT TAKE A POCKETFUL OF PEBBLES AND DROP THEM ALONG THE ROAD AS YOU WALK SOMETIMES THEY ROLL GREAT ROCKS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDES PLAYING A DESPERATE GAME OF BALL WITH EACH OTHER
707-161166-0009 SOMETIMES THEY ARE SENT TO MAKE A BRIDGE OVER NIAGARA FALLS OR TO BUILD A DAM ACROSS A MOUNTAIN TORRENT IN AN HOUR'S TIME NOW AND THEN THEY HAVE TO RAKE OFF A STEEP MOUNTAIN SIDE AS YOU MIGHT A GARDEN BED
707-161166-0010 AND SOMETIMES TO BURY A WHOLE VILLAGE SO QUICKLY THAT THE POOR INHABITANTS DO NOT KNOW WHAT STRANGE HAND BROUGHT SUCH SUDDEN DESTRUCTION UPON THEM THEIR DEEDS OFTEN SEEM TO BE CRUEL AND WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THEIR MEANING
707-161166-0011 BUT WE SHALL SOME TIME KNOW THAT THE LOVING FATHER WHO SENT THEM ORDERS NOTHING FOR OUR HURT BUT HAS ALWAYS A LOVING PURPOSE THOUGH IT MAY BE HIDDEN WHILE I THUS INTRODUCE TO YOU THE FROST GIANTS
707-161166-0012 LET ME ALSO PRESENT THEIR TINY BRETHREN AND SISTERS THE FROST FAIRIES WHO ALWAYS ACCOMPANY THEM ON THEIR EXPEDITIONS AND HOWEVER TERRIBLE IS THE DEED THAT HAS TO BE DONE THESE LITTLE PEOPLE ADORN IT WITH THE MOST LOVELY HANDIWORK
707-161166-0013 TINY FLOWERS AND CRYSTALS AND VEILS OF DELICATE LACE WORK FRINGES AND SPANGLES AND STAR WORK AND CARVING SO THAT NOTHING IS SO HARD AND UGLY AND BARE THAT THEY CANNOT BEAUTIFY IT
707-161166-0014 NOW THAT YOU ARE INTRODUCED YOU WILL PERHAPS LIKE TO JOIN A FROST PARTY THAT STARTED OUT TO WORK ONE DAY IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE FROM THEIR HOMES AMONG THE OLYMPIC MOUNTAINS NANNIE'S RUN
707-161166-0015 CAN YOU IMAGINE A BEAUTIFUL OVAL SHAPED BAY ALMOST ENCIRCLED BY A LONG ARM OF SAND STRETCHING OUT FROM THE MAINLAND IN ITS DEEP WATER THE LARGEST VESSELS MIGHT RIDE AT ANCHOR
707-161166-0016 BUT AT THE TIME OF MY STORY A LONELIER PLACE COULD SCARCELY BE FOUND NOW AND THEN INDIAN CANOES GLIDED OVER THE WATER AND AT LONG INTERVALS SOME VESSEL FROM THE GREAT ISLAND AWAY YONDER TO THE NORTH
707-161166-0017 VISITED THE LITTLE SETTLEMENT UPON THE SHORE OF THE BAY IT IS INDEED A VERY LITTLE SETTLEMENT A FEW HOUSES CLUSTERED TOGETHER UPON THE SANDY BEACH CLOSE TO THE BLUE WATER BEHIND THE HOUSES
707-161166-0018 RISES A CLIFF CROWNED WITH GREAT FIR TREES STANDING TALL AND DARK IN THICK RANKS MAKING A DENSE FOREST AND BEYOND THIS FOREST COLD SNOW COVERED MOUNTAINS LIFT THEIR PEAKS AGAINST THE SKY
707-161166-0019 A FITTING HOME FOR THE FROST GIANTS THREE STREAMS STRAYING FROM THE FAR AWAY MOUNTAINS AND FED BY THEIR MELTED SNOWS AND HIDDEN SPRINGS FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH THE FOREST LEAP AND TUMBLE OVER THE CLIFF
707-161166-0020 AND PASSING THROUGH THE LITTLE SETTLEMENT REACH THE SEA THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE CALL THESE LITTLE STREAMS RUNS AND ONE OF THEM IS NANNIE'S RUN AND NOW WHO IS NANNIE
707-161166-0021 WHY NANNIE IS NANNIE DWIGHT A LITTLE GIRL NOT YET FIVE YEARS OLD WHO LIVES IN THE SMALL SQUARE HOUSE STANDING UNDER THE CLIFF SHE SITS EVEN NOW ON THE DOOR STEP
707-161166-0022 OF THE FIRS HER FATHER AND MOTHER CAME HERE TO LIVE WHEN SHE WAS BUT A BABY AND BEFORE THERE WAS A SINGLE HOUSE BUILT IN THE PLACE AND IT IS OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO HER THAT ONE OF THE STREAMS HAS BEEN NAMED NANNIE'S RUN
707-161166-0023 WHILE NANNIE SITS ON THE DOORSTEP AND LOOKS OUT AT THE SEA WATCHING FOR THE VESSEL THAT WILL BRING HER FATHER HOME FROM VICTORIA WE WILL GO THROUGH THE FOREST AND UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDES TILL WE FIND THE HOME OF THE FROST GIANTS
707-161166-0024 AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO DAY THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ALL WINTER BUT NOT QUITE SO BUSILY AS NOW FOR SINCE YESTERDAY THEY HAVE CRACKED THAT BIG ROCK IN TWO AND DUG THE GREAT CAVE UNDER THE HILL AND NOW
707-161166-0025 THEY ARE GATHERED IN COUNCIL ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THAT OVERLOOKS A DASHING LITTLE STREAM AS WE FOLLOWED THIS STREAM FROM THE SEASHORE WE HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT IT IS NO OTHER THAN NANNIE'S RUN
707-161166-0026 WE ARE ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE GIANTS THINK OF DOING WE HAVE NOT LONG TO WAIT BEFORE WE SHALL SEE AND HEAR TOO FOR A GREAT CREAKING AND CRACKING BEGINS AND WHILE WE GAZE ASTONISHED
707-161166-0027 THE MOUNTAIN SIDE BEGINS TO SLIDE AND PRESENTLY WITH A RUSH AND A ROAR DASHES INTO THE STREAM AND CHOKES IT WITH A HUGE DAM OF EARTH AND ROCKS AND TREES
707-161166-0028 WHAT WILL THE STREAM DO NOW FOR A MOMENT THE WATER LEAPS INTO THE AIR ALL FOAM AND SPARKLE AS IF IT WOULD JUMP OVER THE BARRIER AND FIND ITS WAY TO THE SEA AT ANY RATE BUT THIS PROVES ENTIRELY UNSUCCESSFUL
707-161166-0029 AND AT LAST AFTER WHIRLING AND TUMBLING TRYING TO CREEP UNDER TRYING TO LEAP OVER IT SETTLES ITSELF QUIETLY IN ITS PRISON AS IF TO THINK ABOUT THE MATTER NOW IF YOU WILL STAY AND WATCH IT DAY AFTER DAY
707-161166-0030 YOU WILL SEE WHAT GOOD RESULT WILL COME FROM THIS WAITING FOR EVERY HOUR MORE AND MORE WATER IS RUNNING TO ITS AID AND AS ITS FORCES INCREASE WE BEGIN TO FEEL SURE THAT ALTHOUGH IT CAN NEITHER PASS OVER NOR UNDER
707-161166-0031 IT WILL SOME DAY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THROUGH THE FROST GIANTS DAM AND THE DAY COMES AT LAST WHEN SUMMONING ALL ITS WATERS TO THE ATTACK IT MAKES A BREACH IN THE GREAT EARTH WALL AND IN A STRONG GRAND COLUMN
707-161166-0032 AS HIGH AS THIS ROOM MARCHES AWAY TOWARDS THE SEA AS WE HAVE THE WINGS OF THOUGHT TO TRAVEL WITH LET US HURRY BACK TO THE SETTLEMENT AND SEE WHERE NANNIE IS NOW AND TELL THE PEOPLE IF WE ONLY CAN
707-161166-0033 WHAT A WALL OF WATER IS MARCHING DOWN UPON THEM FOR YOU SEE THE LITTLE CHANNEL THAT USED TO HOLD NANNIE'S RUN IS NOT A QUARTER LARGE ENOUGH FOR THIS TORRENT THAT HAS GATHERED SO LONG BEHIND THE DAM PEEP IN AT THE WINDOW AND SEE HOW NANNIE STANDS AT THE KITCHEN TABLE
707-161166-0034 CUTTING OUT LITTLE CAKES FROM A BIT OF DOUGH THAT HER MOTHER HAS GIVEN HER SHE IS ALL ABSORBED IN HER PLAY AND HER MOTHER HAS GONE TO LOOK INTO THE OVEN AT THE NICELY BROWNING LOAVES
707-161166-0035 SAFE ABOVE THE REACH OF THE WATER BUT ALAS HERE IT STANDS JUST IN THE PATH THAT THE TORRENT WILL TAKE AND WE HAVE NO POWER TO TELL OF THE DANGER THAT IS APPROACHING MISSUS DWIGHT TURNS FROM THE OVEN
707-161166-0036 AND PASSING THE WINDOW ON HER WAY TO THE TABLE SUDDENLY SEES THE GREAT WALL OF WATER ONLY A FEW RODS FROM HER HOUSE WITH ONE STEP SHE REACHES THE BEDROOM SEIZES THE BLANKETS FROM THE BED WRAPS NANNIE IN THEM AND WITH THE LITTLE GIRL ON ONE ARM GRASPS FRANKIE'S HAND
707-161166-0037 AND TELLING HARRY TO RUN BESIDE HER OPENS THE DOOR NEAREST THE CLIFF AND ALMOST FLIES UP ITS STEEP SIDE FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS SITTING BREATHLESS ON THE ROOTS OF AN OLD TREE WITH HER CHILDREN SAFE BESIDE HER
707-161166-0038 SHE SEES THE WHOLE SHORE COVERED WITH SURGING WATER AND THE HOUSES SWEPT INTO THE BAY TOSSING AND DRIFTING THERE LIKE BOATS IN A STORMY SEA AND THIS IS WHAT THE FROST GIANTS DID TO NANNIE'S RUN
707-161166-0039 THE INDIANS WHAT WILL NANNIE DO NOW HERE IN OUR NEW ENGLAND TOWNS IT WOULD SEEM HARD ENOUGH TO HAVE ONE'S HOUSE SWEPT AWAY BEFORE ONE'S EYES
707-161166-0040 OR YOUR UNCLE IN NEW YORK TO STAY UNTIL A NEW HOUSE COULD BE PREPARED FOR YOU BUT HERE IS NANNIE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM ANY SUCH HELP FOR THERE ARE NOT ONLY NO RAILROADS TO TRAVEL UPON
707-161166-0041 BUT NOT EVEN COMMON ROADS NOR HORSES NOR WAGONS NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE NEIGHBORS WHO WILL BRING HELP YOU REMEMBER READING IN YOUR HISTORY HOW WHEN OUR GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHERS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY TO LIVE
707-161166-0042 THEY FOUND IT OCCUPIED BY INDIANS THE INDIANS ARE ALL GONE FROM OUR PART OF THE COUNTRY NOW BUT OUT IN THE FAR NORTH WEST WHERE NANNIE LIVES THEY STILL HAVE THEIR WIGWAMS AND CANOES STILL DRESS IN BLANKETS
707-161166-0043 AND WEAR FEATHERS ON THEIR HEADS AND IN THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE COUNTRY LIVES A TRIBE CALLED THE FLATHEADS THEY TAKE THIS ODD NAME BECAUSE OF A FASHION THEY HAVE OF BINDING A BOARD UPON THE TOP OF A CHILD'S HEAD
707-161166-0044 WHILE HE IS YET VERY YOUNG IN ORDER THAT HE MAY GROW UP WITH A FLATTENED HEAD WHICH IS CONSIDERED A MARK OF BEAUTY AMONG THESE SAVAGES JUST AS SMALL FEET ARE SO CONSIDERED AMONG THE CHINESE YOU KNOW
707-161166-0045 THE FLATHEADS ARE NANNIE'S ONLY NEIGHBORS AND PERHAPS YOU WOULD CONSIDER THEM RATHER UNDESIRABLE FRIENDS BUT WHEN I TELL YOU HOW THEY CAME AT ONCE WITH BLANKETS AND FOOD AND ALL SORTS OF FRIENDLY OFFERS OF SHELTER AND HELP
707-161166-0046 YOU WILL THINK THAT SOME WHITE PEOPLE MIGHT WELL TAKE A LESSON FROM THEM THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF BRINGING VENISON AND SALMON TO THE SETTLEMENT FOR SALE AND WHEN NANNIE'S MOTHER TELLS THEM THAT SHE HAS NO LONGER ANY MONEY TO BUY THEY SAY OH NO IT IS A POTLATCH
707-161166-0047 HAPPILY THE WARM WEATHER IS APPROACHING AND A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAS LIVED OUT OF DOORS SO MUCH DOES NOT FIND IT UNSAFE TO SLEEP IN THE HAMMOCK WHICH HUNTER HAS SLUNG FOR HER AMONG THE TREES OR EVEN ON THE GROUND ROLLED IN AN INDIAN BLANKET
707-161166-0048 AND WHEN HER SHOES WEAR OUT SHE CAN SAFELY RUN BAREFOOTED IN THE WOODS OR ON THE SAND
