1342-133248-0000 A PINT OF ASHES TO A SMALL PAIL OF WHITEWASH IS SUFFICIENT BUT A LITTLE MORE OR LESS WILL DO NO HARM TO REMOVE STAINS FROM BROADCLOTH TAKE AN OUNCE OF PIPE CLAY
1342-133248-0001 WHICH HAS BEEN GROUND FINE MIX IT WITH TWELVE DROPS OF ALCOHOL AND THE SAME QUANTITY OF SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE
1342-133248-0002 LET IT REMAIN TILL DRY THEN RUB IT OFF WITH A WOOLEN CLOTH AND THE SPOTS WILL DISAPPEAR TO REMOVE RED STAINS OF FRUIT FROM LINEN MOISTEN THE CLOTH AND HOLD IT OVER A PIECE OF BURNING SULPHUR
1342-133248-0003 AND APPLY IT AS YOU WOULD ANY OTHER SCOURING DROPS IT WILL TAKE OUT ALL THE GREASE IRON STAINS MAY BE REMOVED BY THE SALT OF LEMONS MANY STAINS MAY BE REMOVED BY DIPPING THE LINEN IN SOME BUTTERMILK
1342-133248-0004 LET IT DRY AND THEN SCOUR IT OFF WITH SOME STRONG SOFT SOAP AND SAND OR USE LEES TO SCOUR IT WITH IT SHOULD BE PUT ON HOT WHICH MAY EASILY BE DONE BY HEATING THE LEES
1342-133248-0005 RUB ON THE SPOTS AND SPREAD THE CLOTH ON THE GRASS WHERE THE SUN WILL SHINE ON IT LET IT LIE TWO OR THREE DAYS THEN WASH IF THE SPOTS ARE WET OCCASIONALLY WHILE LYING ON THE GRASS IT WILL HASTEN THE BLEACHING

1342-133248-0011 THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS I HAVE EVER USED TO DISINFECT DECAYING VEGETABLE MATTER
1342-133248-0012 IF USED ONE PART WITH THREE PARTS OF CHARCOAL IT WILL BE FOUND STILL BETTER HOW TO THAW OUT A WATER PIPE WATER PIPES USUALLY FREEZE UP WHEN EXPOSED
1342-133248-0013 FOR INSIDE THE WALLS WHERE THEY CANNOT BE REACHED THEY ARE OR SHOULD BE PACKED TO PREVENT FREEZING TO THAW OUT A FROZEN PIPE BUNDLE A NEWSPAPER INTO A TORCH LIGHT IT AND PASS IT ALONG THE PIPE SLOWLY
1342-133248-0014 THE ICE WILL YIELD TO THIS MUCH QUICKER THAN TO HOT WATER OR WRAPPINGS OR HOT CLOTHS AS IS THE COMMON PRACTICE TO PREVENT MOLD A SMALL QUANTITY OF CARBOLIC ACID ADDED TO PASTE MUCILAGE AND INK WILL PREVENT MOLD
1342-133248-0015 AN OUNCE OF THE ACID TO A GALLON OF WHITEWASH WILL KEEP CELLARS AND DAIRIES FROM THE DISAGREEABLE ODOR WHICH OFTEN TAINTS MILK AND MEAT KEPT IN SUCH PLACES THAWING FROZEN GAS PIPE
1342-133248-0016 MISTER F H SHELTON SAYS I TOOK OFF FROM OVER THE PIPE SOME FOUR OR FIVE INCHES JUST A CRUST OF EARTH AND THEN PUT A COUPLE OF BUSHELS OF LIME IN THE SPACE POURED WATER OVER IT AND SLAKED IT
1342-133248-0017 AND THEN PUT CANVAS OVER THAT AND ROCKS ON THE CANVAS SO AS TO KEEP THE WIND FROM GETTING UNDERNEATH NEXT MORNING ON RETURNING THERE I FOUND THAT THE FROST HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT FROM THE GROUND FOR NEARLY THREE FEET
1342-133248-0018 IN THE DAYTIME YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO WASTE THE TIME BUT IF YOU HAVE A SPARE NIGHT IN WHICH TO WORK IT IS WORTH WHILE TO TRY IT HOW TO TEST A THERMOMETER
1342-133248-0019 WARM THE THERMOMETER GRADUALLY IN THE STEAM AND THEN PLUNGE IT INTO THE WATER IF IT INDICATES A FIXED TEMPERATURE OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE DEGREES THE INSTRUMENT IS A GOOD ONE INDELIBLE INK AN INDELIBLE INK
1342-133248-0020 THIS WILL FORM A WRITING FLUID WHICH CANNOT BE ERASED WITHOUT DESTRUCTION OF THE PAPER THE INK WILL WRITE GREENISH BLUE BUT AFTERWARD WILL TURN BLACK TO GET A BROKEN CORK OUT OF A BOTTLE IF IN DRAWING A CORK IT BREAKS
1342-133248-0021 AND PUT IT IN HOLDING THE BOTTLE SO AS TO BRING THE PIECE OF CORK NEAR TO THE LOWER PART OF THE NECK CATCH IT IN THE LOOP SO AS TO HOLD IT STATIONARY YOU CAN THEN EASILY EXTRACT IT WITH A CORKSCREW

1342-133248-0024 USING AN OLD SOFT FINE LINEN CLOTH LET IT STAND ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND THEN RUB IT DRY WITH A BUCKSKIN IT WILL MAKE THE SILVER LOOK LIKE NEW TO REMOVE THE ODOR FROM A VIAL
1342-133248-0025 THE ODOR OF ITS LAST CONTENTS MAY BE REMOVED FROM A VIAL BY FILLING IT WITH COLD WATER AND LETTING IT STAND IN ANY AIRY PLACE UNCORKED FOR THREE DAYS CHANGING THE WATER EVERY DAY TO LOOSEN A GLASS STOPPER

1342-133248-0030 OTHER METHODS SHOULD NOT BE EMPLOYED WITHOUT SOME SKILL TO FILL CRACKS IN PLASTER USE VINEGAR INSTEAD OF WATER TO MIX YOUR PLASTER OF PARIS

1342-133248-0036 THEN PLACE IN A COOL SPOT TO PRESERVE BOUQUETS PUT A LITTLE SALTPETRE IN THE WATER YOU USE FOR YOUR BOUQUETS AND THE FLOWERS WILL LIVE FOR A FORTNIGHT TO PRESERVE BROOMS
1342-133248-0037 DIP THEM FOR A MINUTE OR TWO IN A KETTLE OF BOILING SUDS ONCE A WEEK AND THEY WILL LAST MUCH LONGER MAKING THEM TOUGH AND PLIABLE A CARPET WEARS MUCH LONGER SWEPT WITH A BROOM CARED FOR IN THIS MANNER
1342-133248-0038 TO CLEAN BRASSWARE MIX ONE OUNCE OF OXALIC ACID SIX OUNCES OF ROTTEN STONE ALL IN POWDER ONE OUNCE OF SWEET OIL AND SUFFICIENT WATER TO MAKE A PASTE APPLY A SMALL PROPORTION
1342-133248-0039 AND RUB DRY WITH A FLANNEL OR LEATHER THE LIQUID DIP MOST GENERALLY USED CONSISTS OF NITRIC AND SULPHURIC ACIDS BUT THIS IS MORE CORROSIVE TO KEEP OUT MOSQUITOES
1342-133248-0040 IF A BOTTLE OF THE OIL OF PENNYROYAL IS LEFT UNCORKED IN A ROOM AT NIGHT NOT A MOSQUITO NOR ANY OTHER BLOOD SUCKER WILL BE FOUND THERE IN THE MORNING TO KILL COCKROACHES A TEACUPFUL OF WELL BRUISED PLASTER OF PARIS MIXED WITH
1342-133248-0041 ALTHOUGH THIS LAST NAMED INGREDIENT IS NOT ESSENTIAL STREW IT ON THE FLOOR OR INTO THE CHINKS WHERE THEY FREQUENT TO DESTROY ANTS DROP SOME QUICKLIME ON THE MOUTH OF THEIR NEST
1342-133248-0042 AND WASH IT WITH BOILING WATER OR DISSOLVE SOME CAMPHOR IN SPIRITS OF WINE THEN MIX WITH WATER AND POUR INTO THEIR HAUNTS OR TOBACCO WATER WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND EFFECTUAL
1342-133248-0043 THEY ARE AVERSE TO STRONG SCENTS CAMPHOR OR A SPONGE SATURATED WITH CREOSOTE WILL PREVENT THEIR INFESTING A CUPBOARD TO PREVENT THEIR CLIMBING UP TREES PLACE A RING OF TAR ABOUT THE TRUNK OR A CIRCLE OF RAG MOISTENED OCCASIONALLY WITH CREOSOTE
1342-133248-0044 THEN PUT YOUR FURS IN THIS STATE IN BOXES WELL CLOSED WHEN THE FURS ARE WANTED FOR USE BEAT THEM WELL AS BEFORE AND EXPOSE THEM FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO THE AIR WHICH WILL TAKE AWAY THE SMELL OF THE CAMPHOR
1342-133248-0045 IF THE FUR HAS LONG HAIR AS BEAR OR FOX ADD TO THE CAMPHOR AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF BLACK PEPPER IN POWDER TO GET RID OF MOTHS ONE
1342-133248-0046 PROCURE SHAVINGS OF CEDAR WOOD AND INCLOSE IN MUSLIN BAGS WHICH CAN BE DISTRIBUTED FREELY AMONG THE CLOTHES TWO PROCURE SHAVINGS OF CAMPHOR WOOD AND INCLOSE IN BAGS THREE SPRINKLE PIMENTO ALLSPICE BERRIES AMONG THE CLOTHES

1342-133248-0048 THE MATTRESS AND BINDING OF THE BED SHOULD BE EXAMINED AND THE SAME PROCESS ATTENDED TO AS THEY GENERALLY HARBOR MORE IN THESE PARTS THAN IN THE BEDSTEAD TEN CENTS WORTH OF NAPHTHA IS SUFFICIENT FOR ONE BED
1342-133248-0049 I HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME TROUBLED WITH BUGS AND NEVER COULD GET RID OF THEM BY ANY CLEAN AND EXPEDITIOUS METHOD UNTIL A FRIEND TOLD ME TO SUSPEND A SMALL BAG OF CAMPHOR TO THE BED JUST IN THE CENTER OVERHEAD
1342-133248-0050 I DID SO AND THE ENEMY WAS MOST EFFECTUALLY REPULSED AND HAS NOT MADE HIS APPEARANCE SINCE NOT EVEN FOR A RECONNOISSANCE THIS IS A SIMPLE METHOD OF GETTING RID OF THESE PESTS AND IS WORTH A TRIAL TO SEE IF IT BE EFFECTUAL IN OTHER CASES
1342-133248-0051 MIXTURE FOR DESTROYING FLIES INFUSION OF QUASSIA ONE PINT BROWN SUGAR FOUR OUNCES GROUND PEPPER TWO OUNCES TO BE WELL MIXED TOGETHER
1342-133248-0052 A GOOD WAY TO RID THE HOUSE OF FLIES IS TO SATURATE SMALL CLOTHS WITH OIL OF SASSAFRAS AND LAY THEM IN WINDOWS AND DOORS THE FLIES WILL SOON LEAVE AGING OAK
1342-133248-0053 PLACE THE PIECE TO BE FUMED WITH AN EVAPORATING DISH CONTAINING CONCENTRATED AMMONIA IN A BOX AND CLOSE IT AIRTIGHT LEAVE FOR TWELVE HOURS AND FINISH WITH A WAX POLISH
