8057-296395-0000 VERY LONG BEFORE THE CAT WAS KEPT IN THIS COUNTRY AS A DOMESTICATED ANIMAL IT WAS POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS IN A TAME STATE AND WAS MOREOVER HELD IN REVERENCE BY THAT REMARKABLE AND SUPERSTITIOUS PEOPLE BEING REGARDED SACRED
8057-296395-0001 TO THE GODDESS PASHT AT DEATH THE BODY WAS EMBALMED WITH DEVOUT CARE AND SPECIMENS OF CAT MUMMIES MAY BE SEEN IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM THE EGYPTIAN CAT
8057-296395-0002 AND WITH MORE OR LESS INDISTINCT MARKINGS OF THE TABBY CHARACTER IT IS OF ABOUT ORDINARY SIZE THE TAIL IS IN FORM SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT OF MOST OF OUR CATS AND THE EARS ARE LARGISH AND POINTED IN A SLIGHTLY LYNX LIKE FASHION
8057-296395-0003 IT IS SUPPOSED THAT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS SPREAD FROM EGYPT WITH THE TIDE OF CIVILIZATION WESTWARD
8057-296395-0004 I MAY HERE NOTICE THAT UNLIKE THE DOG THE CAT HAS NEVER BEEN TAMED BY THE SAVAGE RACES OF MANKIND BUT BY THE CIVILIZED OR EVEN THE SEMI CIVILIZED PEOPLES OF THE WORLD THE CAT
8057-296395-0005 IS AT THE PRESENT DAY MORE OR LESS VALUED AS A USEFUL MOUSER OR AS A CHERISHED HOUSEHOLD PET IT IS REMARKABLE THAT AT A TIME WHEN THE WILD CAT
8057-296395-0006 THE HOUSE CAT WAS UNKNOWN IT WAS EVIDENTLY AN ANIMAL OF FOREIGN IMPORTATION AND SO HIGHLY VALUED AS A MOUSER AS TO HAVE BEEN PROTECTED BY ROYAL STATUTE
8057-296395-0007 THE EARLIEST RECORD OF THE TAME CAT IN THIS COUNTRY IS AS REMOTE AS A D
8057-296395-0008 OR HOWEL THE GOOD ENFORCED THE VERY JUST BUT PRIMITIVE FINE OF A MILCH EWE ITS FLEECE AND LAMB OR AS MUCH WHEAT FROM THE DESTROYER OR ROBBER OF A CAT AT THE ROYAL GRANARY
8057-296395-0009 AS WOULD COVER IT TO THE TIP OF THE TAIL THE ANIMAL BEING SUSPENDED BY THAT MEMBER WITH THE HEAD ONLY TOUCHING THE GROUND AS THE DOMESTIC CAT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD WILL BREED OCCASIONALLY WITH THE WILD RACES OF THE LOCALITY
8057-296395-0010 AND AS CATS ARE CONVEYED FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY IT IS PROBABLE THAT OUR CATS ARE OF SOMEWHAT COMPOUND PEDIGREE IT IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE THAT OUR FINE ENGLISH TABBIES HAVE A TRACE
8057-296395-0011 OF THE BRITISH WILD CAT BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE OBSCURE THE DOMESTIC CAT IS NOT REGARDED IN ZOOLOGY AS THE TYPICAL FORM TO REPRESENT
8057-296395-0012 AS MIGHT NATURALLY BE SUPPOSED AND IT MIGHT HAVE JUSTLY BEEN SO BUT THE ANIMAL CHOSEN AS THE GENERIC EXAMPLE IS THE COMMON WILD CAT AND THEREFORE KNOWN IN SCIENCE AS FELIS CATUS
8057-296395-0013 WHICH EVERY READER WILL UNDERSTAND TO SIGNIFY CAT IT WILL BE BEYOND THE SCOPE AND AIM OF THIS CHAPTER TO DESCRIBE ALL THE KNOWN DISTINCT SPECIES OF WILD CAT IN DESCRIBING THE TRUE CATS SUCH AS THE PAMPAS CAT
8057-296395-0014 OR THE COLOCOLO OF AMERICA THE CHAUS OR THE SERVAL OF AFRICA
8057-296395-0015 OR THE LEOPARD CAT OF INDIA OUR SUBJECT WOULD LEAD US ON FROM THESE AND OTHER TIGER CATS AS THE OCELOT AND THE RIMAN DAHAN WITHOUT POWER TO DEFINE A CLEAR LINE OF DISTINCTION UP TO THE LEOPARDS
8057-296395-0016 AND FINALLY TO THE KING OF BEASTS HIMSELF
8057-296395-0017 THERE ARE UPWARDS OF HALF A HUNDRED DISTINCT SPECIES KNOWN
8057-296395-0018 WHICH WITH REGARD TO DOMESTIC ANIMALS ARE TERMED BREEDS AND THE CASUAL SPORTS
8057-296395-0019 THAT IS A NATIVE OF THIS COUNTRY AND OFTEN TERMED BY US THE BRITISH WILD CAT ALTHOUGH NOW ALMOST TOTALLY EXTINCT ON OUR ISLAND
8057-296395-0020 ITS LAST HAUNT HERE IS IN THE REMOTE PARTS OF SCOTLAND AND SO SCARCE HAS IT BECOME THAT ITS EXISTENCE EVEN THERE IS NOW SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BUT IT IS STILL NOW TO BE FOUND WITH BUT SLIGHT LOCAL VARIATIONS ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE
8057-296395-0021 AND NORTHERN ASIA AND IS THEREFORE ALSO KNOWN AS THE EUROPEAN WILD CAT IT IS NOT FOUND VERY FAR NORTH AND NEITHER IN NORWAY NOR SWEDEN THERE THE LYNX REIGNS SUPREME
8057-296395-0022 THE WILD CAT IS A FINE ANIMAL OF LARGER GROWTH THAN THE CAT OF OUR FAMILIAR ACQUAINTANCE AND STANDS TALL IT IS A STRONG MUSCULAR WELL BUILT CAT A PERFECT TABBY AND SO FIERCE AN ANIMAL
8057-296395-0023 AS TO HAVE BEEN JUSTLY TERMED THE BRITISH TIGER AN ADULT MALE MEASURES ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT INCHES IN LENGTH FROM THE NOSE TO THE ROOT OF THE TAIL AND THE TAIL IS ABOUT THIRTEEN INCHES WHICH IS PROPORTIONATELY SHORT
8057-296395-0024 AND IT DOES NOT TAPER AT THE END AS DOES THAT OF OUR DOMESTIC CATS BUT IS ABOUT THE SAME THICKNESS THROUGHOUT RESEMBLING SOMEWHAT THAT OF THE SERVAL WHEN THE ANIMAL IS EXCITED AND THE TAIL ENLARGES AFTER THE MANNER OF ALL CATS
8057-296395-0025 AND WE MAY ADD THE SMALLER BUT NOT LESS DESTRUCTIVE RODENTS AND A VARIETY OF FEATHERED GAME THE BARN DOOR CAT IS SOMETIMES TEMPTED TO ABSCOND AND TAKE TO A ROMANTIC AND SEMI WILD LIFE IN THE WOODS
