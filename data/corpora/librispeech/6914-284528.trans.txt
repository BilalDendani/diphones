6914-284528-0000 IN THE MIDST OF THE SHOES STOOD A PAIR OF RED ONES JUST LIKE THOSE THE PRINCESS HAD WORN HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE
6914-284528-0001 SAID THE OLD LADY THEY SHINE SO YES THEY SHINE SAID KAREN AND THEY FITTED AND WERE BOUGHT BUT THE OLD LADY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEIR BEING RED
6914-284528-0002 YET SUCH WAS THE CASE EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HER FEET AND WHEN SHE STEPPED THROUGH THE CHANCEL DOOR ON THE CHURCH PAVEMENT IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE OLD FIGURES ON THE TOMBS THOSE PORTRAITS OF OLD PREACHERS AND PREACHERS WIVES
6914-284528-0003 WITH STIFF RUFFS AND LONG BLACK DRESSES FIXED THEIR EYES ON HER RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF THEM AS THE CLERGYMAN LAID HIS HAND UPON HER HEAD AND SPOKE OF THE HOLY BAPTISM OF THE COVENANT WITH GOD AND HOW SHE SHOULD BE NOW A MATURED CHRISTIAN
6914-284528-0004 AND THE ORGAN PEALED SO SOLEMNLY THE SWEET CHILDREN'S VOICES SANG AND THE OLD MUSIC DIRECTORS SANG BUT KAREN ONLY THOUGHT OF HER RED SHOES IN THE AFTERNOON THE OLD LADY HEARD FROM EVERYONE THAT THE SHOES HAD BEEN RED
6914-284528-0005 AND SHE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY WRONG OF KAREN THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL BECOMING
6914-284528-0006 EVEN WHEN SHE SHOULD BE OLDER THE NEXT SUNDAY THERE WAS THE SACRAMENT AND KAREN LOOKED AT THE BLACK SHOES LOOKED AT THE RED ONES LOOKED AT THEM AGAIN AND PUT ON THE RED SHOES THE SUN SHONE GLORIOUSLY
6914-284528-0007 KAREN AND THE OLD LADY WALKED ALONG THE PATH THROUGH THE CORN
6914-284528-0008 AT THE CHURCH DOOR STOOD AN OLD SOLDIER WITH A CRUTCH AND WITH A WONDERFULLY LONG BEARD WHICH WAS MORE RED THAN WHITE AND HE BOWED TO THE GROUND AND ASKED THE OLD LADY WHETHER HE MIGHT DUST HER SHOES AND KAREN STRETCHED OUT HER LITTLE FOOT
6914-284528-0009 SEE WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES SAID THE SOLDIER SIT FIRM WHEN YOU DANCE AND HE PUT HIS HAND OUT TOWARDS THE SOLES AND THE OLD LADY GAVE THE OLD SOLDIER ALMS AND WENT INTO THE CHURCH WITH KAREN
6914-284528-0010 AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH LOOKED AT KAREN'S RED SHOES AND ALL THE PICTURES AND AS KAREN KNELT BEFORE THE ALTAR
6914-284528-0011 AND THE OLD LADY GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE KAREN RAISED HER FOOT TO GET IN AFTER HER WHEN THE OLD SOLDIER SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES AND KAREN COULD NOT HELP DANCING A STEP OR TWO AND WHEN SHE BEGAN HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE
6914-284528-0012 IT WAS JUST AS THOUGH THE SHOES HAD POWER OVER THEM SHE DANCED ROUND THE CHURCH CORNER SHE COULD NOT LEAVE OFF THE COACHMAN WAS OBLIGED TO RUN AFTER AND CATCH HOLD OF HER AND HE LIFTED HER IN THE CARRIAGE BUT HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE SO THAT SHE TROD ON THE OLD LADY DREADFULLY
6914-284528-0013 AT LENGTH SHE TOOK THE SHOES OFF AND THEN HER LEGS HAD PEACE THE SHOES WERE PLACED IN A CLOSET AT HOME BUT KAREN COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM NOW THE OLD LADY WAS SICK AND IT WAS SAID SHE COULD NOT RECOVER SHE MUST BE NURSED AND WAITED UPON
6914-284528-0014 AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHOSE DUTY IT WAS SO MUCH AS KAREN'S BUT THERE WAS A GREAT BALL IN THE CITY TO WHICH KAREN WAS INVITED SHE LOOKED AT THE OLD LADY WHO COULD NOT RECOVER SHE LOOKED AT THE RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE NO SIN IN IT
6914-284528-0015 SHE PUT ON THE RED SHOES SHE MIGHT DO THAT ALSO SHE THOUGHT BUT THEN SHE WENT TO THE BALL AND BEGAN TO DANCE WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE TO THE RIGHT THE SHOES WOULD DANCE TO THE LEFT
6914-284528-0016 DOWN THE STEPS INTO THE STREET AND OUT OF THE CITY GATE
6914-284528-0017 THEN IT WAS SUDDENLY LIGHT UP AMONG THE TREES AND SHE FANCIED IT MUST BE THE MOON FOR THERE WAS A FACE BUT IT WAS THE OLD SOLDIER WITH THE RED BEARD HE SAT THERE NODDED HIS HEAD AND SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES THEN SHE WAS TERRIFIED
6914-284528-0018 AND WANTED TO FLING OFF THE RED SHOES BUT THEY CLUNG FAST
6914-284528-0019 OVER FIELDS AND MEADOWS IN RAIN AND SUNSHINE BY NIGHT AND DAY BUT AT NIGHT IT WAS THE MOST FEARFUL SHE DANCED OVER THE CHURCHYARD BUT THE DEAD DID NOT DANCE THEY HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO DANCE SHE WISHED TO SEAT HERSELF ON A POOR MAN'S GRAVE
6914-284528-0020 WHERE THE BITTER TANSY GREW BUT FOR HER THERE WAS NEITHER PEACE NOR REST AND WHEN SHE DANCED TOWARDS THE OPEN CHURCH DOOR SHE SAW AN ANGEL STANDING THERE
6914-284528-0021 HE WORE LONG WHITE GARMENTS HE HAD WINGS WHICH REACHED FROM HIS SHOULDERS TO THE EARTH HIS COUNTENANCE WAS SEVERE AND GRAVE AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD A SWORD BROAD AND GLITTERING DANCE SHALT THOU

6914-284528-0023 BUT SHE DID NOT HEAR THE ANGEL'S REPLY FOR THE SHOES CARRIED HER THROUGH THE GATE INTO THE FIELDS ACROSS ROADS AND BRIDGES AND SHE MUST KEEP EVER DANCING
6914-284528-0024 WITHIN SOUNDED A PSALM A COFFIN DECKED WITH FLOWERS WAS BORNE FORTH THEN SHE KNEW THAT THE OLD LADY WAS DEAD AND FELT THAT SHE WAS ABANDONED BY ALL AND CONDEMNED BY THE ANGEL OF GOD SHE DANCED AND SHE WAS FORCED TO DANCE THROUGH THE GLOOMY NIGHT
6914-284528-0025 THE SHOES CARRIED HER OVER STACK AND STONE SHE WAS TORN TILL SHE BLED SHE DANCED OVER THE HEATH TILL SHE CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE HERE SHE KNEW DWELT THE EXECUTIONER AND SHE TAPPED WITH HER FINGERS AT THE WINDOW AND SAID

6914-284528-0027 SAID KAREN THEN I CAN'T REPENT OF MY SINS BUT STRIKE OFF MY FEET IN THE RED SHOES AND THEN SHE CONFESSED HER ENTIRE SIN AND THE EXECUTIONER STRUCK OFF HER FEET WITH THE RED SHOES BUT THE SHOES DANCED AWAY WITH THE LITTLE FEET ACROSS THE FIELD INTO THE DEEP WOOD

6914-284528-0030 THE WHOLE WEEK SHE WAS UNHAPPY AND WEPT MANY BITTER TEARS BUT WHEN SUNDAY RETURNED SHE SAID WELL NOW I HAVE SUFFERED AND STRUGGLED ENOUGH I REALLY BELIEVE I AM AS GOOD AS MANY A ONE WHO SITS IN THE CHURCH AND HOLDS HER HEAD SO HIGH
6914-284528-0031 AND AWAY SHE WENT BOLDLY
6914-284528-0032 BEFORE SHE SAW THE RED SHOES DANCING BEFORE HER AND SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AND TURNED BACK AND REPENTED OF HER SIN FROM HER HEART
6914-284528-0033 AND WOULD DO EVERYTHING SHE COULD SHE DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE WAGES ONLY SHE WISHED TO HAVE A HOME AND BE WITH GOOD PEOPLE AND THE CLERGYMAN'S WIFE WAS SORRY FOR HER AND TOOK HER INTO SERVICE AND SHE WAS INDUSTRIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL
6914-284528-0034 SHE SAT STILL AND LISTENED WHEN THE CLERGYMAN READ THE BIBLE IN THE EVENINGS ALL THE CHILDREN THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HER BUT WHEN THEY SPOKE OF DRESS AND GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WHEN THE FAMILY WAS GOING TO CHURCH
6914-284528-0035 THEY ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT GO WITH THEM BUT SHE GLANCED SORROWFULLY WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AT HER CRUTCHES THE FAMILY WENT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD BUT SHE WENT ALONE INTO HER LITTLE CHAMBER THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR A BED AND CHAIR TO STAND IN IT
6914-284528-0036 AND HERE SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER PRAYER BOOK AND WHILST SHE READ WITH A PIOUS MIND THE WIND BORE THE STRAINS OF THE ORGAN TOWARDS HER AND SHE RAISED HER TEARFUL COUNTENANCE AND SAID O GOD HELP ME
6914-284528-0037 BUT HE NO LONGER CARRIED THE SHARP SWORD BUT IN ITS STEAD A SPLENDID GREEN SPRAY FULL OF ROSES AND HE TOUCHED THE CEILING WITH THE SPRAY AND THE CEILING ROSE SO HIGH AND WHERE HE HAD TOUCHED IT THERE GLEAMED A GOLDEN STAR AND HE TOUCHED THE WALLS AND THEY WIDENED OUT
6914-284528-0038 AND SHE SAW THE ORGAN WHICH WAS PLAYING SHE SAW THE OLD PICTURES OF THE PREACHERS AND THE PREACHERS WIVES THE CONGREGATION SAT IN CUSHIONED SEATS AND SANG OUT OF THEIR PRAYER BOOKS FOR THE CHURCH ITSELF HAD COME TO THE POOR GIRL IN HER NARROW CHAMBER OR ELSE SHE HAD COME INTO THE CHURCH
