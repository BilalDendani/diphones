3032-19361-0000 LIFE AND WORK OF KEPLER KEPLER WAS BORN IN DECEMBER FIFTEEN SEVENTY ONE
3032-19361-0001 FATHER AN OFFICER IN THE DUKE'S ARMY MOTHER SOMETHING OF A VIRAGO BOTH VERY POOR KEPLER WAS UTILIZED AS A TAVERN POT BOY BUT ULTIMATELY SENT TO A CHARITY SCHOOL AND THENCE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TUEBINGEN
3032-19361-0002 THEIR TIMES OF REVOLUTION AND THEIR DISTANCES FROM THE SUN ULTIMATELY HIT UPON HIS FANCIFUL REGULAR SOLID HYPOTHESIS AND PUBLISHED HIS FIRST BOOK IN FIFTEEN NINETY SEVEN IN FIFTEEN NINETY NINE WAS INVITED BY TYCHO TO PRAGUE
3032-19361-0003 AND THERE APPOINTED IMPERIAL MATHEMATICIAN AT A HANDSOME BUT SELDOM PAID SALARY OBSERVED THE NEW STAR OF SIXTEEN O FOUR ENDEAVOURED TO FIND THE LAW OF REFRACTION OF LIGHT FROM VITELLIO'S MEASUREMENTS BUT FAILED
3032-19361-0004 AFTER INCREDIBLE LABOUR THROUGH INNUMERABLE WRONG GUESSES AND SIX YEARS OF ALMOST INCESSANT CALCULATION HE AT LENGTH EMERGED IN HIS TWO LAWS DISCOVERIES WHICH SWEPT AWAY ALL EPICYCLES DEFERENTS
3032-19361-0005 EQUANTS AND OTHER REMNANTS OF THE GREEK SYSTEM AND USHERED IN THE DAWN OF MODERN ASTRONOMY
3032-19361-0006 PLANETS MOVE IN ELLIPSES WITH THE SUN IN ONE FOCUS LAW TWO THE RADIUS VECTOR OR LINE JOINING SUN AND PLANET SWEEPS OUT EQUAL AREAS IN EQUAL TIMES
3032-19361-0007 PUBLISHED HIS SECOND BOOK CONTAINING THESE LAWS IN SIXTEEN O NINE DEATH OF RUDOLPH IN SIXTEEN TWELVE AND SUBSEQUENT INCREASED MISERY AND MISFORTUNE OF KEPLER
3032-19361-0008 ULTIMATELY DISCOVERED THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TIMES AND DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN GROPING ALL HIS MATURE LIFE AND ANNOUNCED IT IN SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN LAW THREE
3032-19361-0009 THE SQUARE OF THE TIME OF REVOLUTION OR YEAR OF EACH PLANET IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE CUBE OF ITS MEAN DISTANCE FROM THE SUN THE BOOK IN WHICH THIS LAW WAS PUBLISHED ON CELESTIAL HARMONIES
3032-19361-0010 WAS DEDICATED TO JAMES OF ENGLAND IN SIXTEEN TWENTY HAD TO INTERVENE TO PROTECT HIS MOTHER FROM BEING TORTURED FOR WITCHCRAFT ACCEPTED A PROFESSORSHIP AT LINZ PUBLISHED THE RUDOLPHINE TABLES IN SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
3032-19361-0011 AND HIS OWN THEORY MADE A LAST EFFORT TO OVERCOME HIS POVERTY BY GETTING THE ARREARS OF HIS SALARY PAID AT PRAGUE BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND CONTRACTING BRAIN FEVER ON THE JOURNEY DIED IN NOVEMBER
3032-19361-0012 AND MISFORTUNE AND PLACED HIMSELF IN THE VERY HIGHEST RANK OF SCIENTIFIC MEN HIS LAWS SO EXTRAORDINARILY DISCOVERED INTRODUCED ORDER AND SIMPLICITY
3032-19361-0013 INTO WHAT ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CHAOS OF DETAILED OBSERVATIONS AND THEY SERVED AS A SECURE BASIS FOR THE SPLENDID ERECTION MADE ON THEM BY NEWTON SEVEN PLANETS OF THE PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM
3032-19361-0014 BUT NOT ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN THEORETICAL AND MATHEMATICAL POWER THE OTHER POOR SICKLY DEVOID OF EXPERIMENTAL GIFTS AND UNFITTED BY NATURE FOR ACCURATE OBSERVATION
3032-19361-0015 BUT STRONG ALMOST BEYOND COMPETITION IN SPECULATIVE SUBTLETY AND INNATE MATHEMATICAL PERCEPTION THE ONE IS THE COMPLEMENT OF THE OTHER AND FROM THE FACT OF THEIR FOLLOWING EACH OTHER SO CLOSELY
3032-19361-0016 AND WAS REDUCED TO KEEPING A TAVERN YOUNG JOHN KEPLER WAS THEREUPON TAKEN FROM SCHOOL AND EMPLOYED AS POT BOY BETWEEN THE AGES OF NINE AND TWELVE HE WAS A SICKLY LAD
3032-19361-0017 SUBJECT TO VIOLENT ILLNESSES FROM THE CRADLE SO THAT HIS LIFE WAS FREQUENTLY DESPAIRED OF ULTIMATELY HE WAS SENT TO A MONASTIC SCHOOL AND THENCE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TUEBINGEN WHERE HE GRADUATED SECOND ON THE LIST
3032-19361-0018 MEANWHILE HOME AFFAIRS HAD GONE TO RACK AND RUIN HIS FATHER ABANDONED THE HOME AND LATER DIED ABROAD THE MOTHER QUARRELLED WITH ALL HER RELATIONS INCLUDING HER SON JOHN
3032-19361-0019 THOUGH STIPULATING THAT IT SHOULD NOT DEBAR HIM FROM SOME MORE BRILLIANT PROFESSION WHEN THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR ASTRONOMY IN THOSE DAYS SEEMS TO HAVE RANKED AS A MINOR SCIENCE LIKE MINERALOGY OR METEOROLOGY NOW
3032-19361-0020 AND AS HE HAD A MOST SINGULARLY RESTLESS AND INQUISITIVE MIND FULL OF APPRECIATION OF EVERYTHING RELATING TO NUMBER AND MAGNITUDE WAS A BORN SPECULATOR AND THINKER JUST AS MOZART WAS A BORN MUSICIAN
3032-19361-0021 OR BIDDER A BORN CALCULATOR HE WAS AGITATED BY QUESTIONS SUCH AS THESE WHY ARE THERE EXACTLY SIX PLANETS IS THERE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THEIR ORBITAL DISTANCES
3032-19361-0022 OR BETWEEN THEIR ORBITS AND THE TIMES OF DESCRIBING THEM THESE THINGS TORMENTED HIM AND HE THOUGHT ABOUT THEM DAY AND NIGHT IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES THIS QUESTIONING WHY THERE SHOULD BE SIX PLANETS
3032-19361-0023 IF YOU INSCRIBE IN A CIRCLE A LARGE NUMBER OF EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES THEY ENVELOP ANOTHER CIRCLE
3032-19361-0024 BROODING OVER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT THE IDEA OF TRYING SOLID FIGURES SUDDENLY STRIKES HIM WHAT HAVE PLANE FIGURES TO DO WITH THE CELESTIAL ORBITS HE CRIES OUT INSCRIBE THE REGULAR SOLIDS
3032-19361-0025 AND THEN BRILLIANT IDEA HE REMEMBERS THAT THERE ARE BUT FIVE EUCLID HAD SHOWN
3032-19361-0026 THE REASON OF THERE BEING ONLY SIX SEEMS TO BE ATTAINED THIS COINCIDENCE ASSURES HIM HE IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM AND HOPE HE REPRESENTS THE EARTH'S ORBIT BY A SPHERE
3032-19361-0027 AS THE NORM AND MEASURE OF ALL ROUND IT HE CIRCUMSCRIBES A DODECAHEDRON AND PUTS ANOTHER SPHERE ROUND THAT WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THE ORBIT OF MARS ROUND THAT AGAIN A TETRAHEDRON
3032-19361-0028 AN OCTAHEDRON WHICH FIGURES HE TAKES TO INCLOSE THE SPHERES OF VENUS AND OF MERCURY RESPECTIVELY
3032-19361-0029 CAN NEVER BE TOLD IN WORDS I REGRETTED NO MORE THE TIME WASTED I TIRED OF NO LABOUR I SHUNNED NO TOIL OF RECKONING DAYS AND NIGHTS SPENT IN CALCULATION
3032-19361-0030 UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH AND AS HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE BY FAR THE BEST PLANETARY OBSERVATIONS OF ANY MAN LIVING KEPLER WROTE TO HIM TO KNOW IF HE MIGHT COME AND EXAMINE THEM SO AS TO PERFECT HIS THEORY
3032-19361-0031 TYCHO IMMEDIATELY REPLIED COME NOT AS A STRANGER BUT AS A VERY WELCOME FRIEND COME AND SHARE IN MY OBSERVATIONS WITH SUCH INSTRUMENTS AS I HAVE WITH ME AND AS A DEARLY BELOVED ASSOCIATE
3032-19361-0032 AFTER THIS VISIT TYCHO WROTE AGAIN OFFERING HIM THE POST OF MATHEMATICAL ASSISTANT WHICH AFTER HESITATION WAS ACCEPTED PART OF THE HESITATION KEPLER EXPRESSES BY SAYING THAT
3032-19361-0033 SO THAT HE HAD TO APPLY FOR HELP TO TYCHO IT IS CLEAR INDEED THAT FOR SOME TIME NOW HE SUBSISTED ENTIRELY ON THE BOUNTY OF TYCHO AND HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF
3032-19361-0034 I MUST READ YOU A LETTER WRITTEN TO HIM BY KEPLER IT SEEMS THAT KEPLER ON ONE OF HIS ABSENCES FROM PRAGUE DRIVEN HALF MAD WITH POVERTY AND TROUBLE FELL FOUL OF TYCHO
3032-19361-0035 WHOM HE THOUGHT TO BE BEHAVING BADLY IN MONEY MATTERS TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY AND WROTE HIM A VIOLENT LETTER FULL OF REPROACHES AND INSULTS
3032-19361-0036 POINTING OUT THE GROUNDLESSNESS AND INGRATITUDE OF THE ACCUSATION KEPLER REPENTS INSTANTLY AND REPLIES MOST NOBLE TYCHO THESE ARE THE WORDS OF HIS LETTER
3032-19361-0037 HOW SHALL I ENUMERATE OR RIGHTLY ESTIMATE YOUR BENEFITS CONFERRED ON ME FOR TWO MONTHS YOU HAVE LIBERALLY AND GRATUITOUSLY MAINTAINED ME AND MY WHOLE FAMILY YOU HAVE PROVIDED FOR ALL MY WISHES
3032-19361-0038 YOU HAVE DONE ME EVERY POSSIBLE KINDNESS YOU HAVE COMMUNICATED TO ME EVERYTHING YOU HOLD MOST DEAR NO ONE BY WORD OR DEED HAS INTENTIONALLY INJURED ME IN ANYTHING IN SHORT NOT TO YOUR CHILDREN
3032-19361-0039 YOUR WIFE OR YOURSELF HAVE YOU SHOWN MORE INDULGENCE THAN TO ME THIS BEING SO AS I AM ANXIOUS TO PUT ON RECORD I CANNOT REFLECT WITHOUT CONSTERNATION
3032-19361-0040 THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO GIVEN UP BY GOD TO MY OWN INTEMPERANCE AS TO SHUT MY EYES ON ALL THESE BENEFITS THAT INSTEAD OF MODEST AND RESPECTFUL GRATITUDE I SHOULD INDULGE FOR THREE WEEKS IN CONTINUAL
3032-19361-0041 MOROSENESS TOWARDS ALL YOUR FAMILY IN HEADLONG PASSION AND THE UTMOST INSOLENCE TOWARDS YOURSELF WHO POSSESS SO MANY CLAIMS ON MY VENERATION FROM YOUR NOBLE FAMILY YOUR EXTRAORDINARY LEARNING
3032-19361-0042 AND DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION WHATEVER I HAVE SAID OR WRITTEN AGAINST THE PERSON THE FAME THE HONOUR AND THE LEARNING OF YOUR EXCELLENCY OR WHATEVER IN ANY OTHER WAY I HAVE INJURIOUSLY SPOKEN OR WRITTEN
3032-19361-0043 IN SIXTEEN O ONE KEPLER WAS APPOINTED IMPERIAL MATHEMATICIAN TO ASSIST TYCHO IN HIS CALCULATIONS THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH DID A GOOD PIECE OF WORK IN THUS MAINTAINING THESE TWO EMINENT MEN BUT IT IS QUITE CLEAR
3032-19361-0044 THAT IT WAS AS ASTROLOGERS THAT HE VALUED THEM AND ALL HE CARED FOR IN THE PLANETARY MOTIONS WAS LIMITED TO THEIR SUPPOSED EFFECT ON HIS OWN AND HIS KINGDOM'S DESTINY
3032-19361-0045 AND THE TABLES UPON WHICH TYCHO WAS NOW ENGAGED ARE WELL CALLED THE RUDOLPHINE TABLES THESE TABLES OF PLANETARY MOTION TYCHO HAD ALWAYS REGARDED AS THE MAIN WORK OF HIS LIFE BUT HE DIED BEFORE THEY WERE FINISHED
3032-19361-0046 AND ON HIS DEATH BED HE INTRUSTED THE COMPLETION OF THEM TO KEPLER WHO LOYALLY UNDERTOOK THEIR CHARGE THE IMPERIAL FUNDS WERE BY THIS TIME HOWEVER SO TAXED BY WARS AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES
3032-19361-0047 AND DRAFTS ON ESTATES FOR IT BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THEM TO BE HONOURED THEY WERE WORTHLESS AND HE HAD NO POWER TO ENFORCE HIS CLAIMS SO EVERYTHING BUT BROODING HAD TO BE ABANDONED AS TOO EXPENSIVE
3032-19361-0048 AND HE PROCEEDED TO STUDY OPTICS HE GAVE A VERY ACCURATE EXPLANATION OF THE ACTION OF THE HUMAN EYE AND MADE MANY HYPOTHESES SOME OF THEM SHREWD AND CLOSE TO THE MARK CONCERNING THE LAW OF REFRACTION OF LIGHT IN DENSE MEDIA
3032-19361-0049 BUT THOUGH SEVERAL MINOR POINTS OF INTEREST TURNED UP NOTHING OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE CAME OUT OF THIS LONG RESEARCH THE TRUE LAW OF REFRACTION WAS DISCOVERED SOME YEARS AFTER BY A DUTCH PROFESSOR
3032-19361-0050 WILLEBROD SNELL WE MUST NOW DEVOTE A LITTLE TIME TO THE MAIN WORK OF KEPLER'S LIFE ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN AT PRAGUE HE HAD BEEN MAKING A SEVERE STUDY OF THE MOTION OF THE PLANET MARS
3032-19361-0051 THE PLANETS DID NOT REVOLVE IN SIMPLE CIRCLES THEY DID NOT TRY OTHER CURVES AS WE SHOULD AT ONCE DO NOW BUT THEY TRIED COMBINATIONS OF CIRCLES
3032-19361-0052 HENCE WAS INTRODUCED THE IDEA OF AN EQUANT
3032-19361-0053 AN ARBITRARY POINT NOT THE EARTH ABOUT WHICH THE SPEED MIGHT BE UNIFORM COPERNICUS BY MAKING THE SUN THE CENTRE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SIMPLIFY A GOOD DEAL OF THIS
3032-19361-0054 AND TO ABOLISH THE EQUANT BUT NOW THAT KEPLER HAD THE ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS OF TYCHO TO REFER TO HE FOUND IMMENSE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING THE TRUE POSITIONS OF THE PLANETS
3032-19361-0055 FOR A CONSIDERABLE COLLECTION OF DATA TO HAVE ACCUMULATED WITH RESPECT TO IT HE TRIED ALL MANNER OF CIRCULAR ORBITS FOR THE EARTH AND FOR MARS PLACING THEM IN ALL SORTS OF ASPECTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SUN
3032-19361-0056 BOTH BEING SUPPOSED EXCENTRIC WITH RESPECT TO THE SUN BUT HE COULD NOT GET ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENT TO WORK WITH UNIFORM MOTION ABOUT THE SUN SO HE REINTRODUCED THE EQUANT
3032-19361-0057 AND THUS HAD ANOTHER VARIABLE AT HIS DISPOSAL IN FACT TWO FOR HE HAD AN EQUANT FOR THE EARTH AND ANOTHER FOR MARS GETTING A PATTERN OF THE KIND SUGGESTED IN FIG TWENTY NINE
3032-19361-0058 THE EQUANTS MIGHT DIVIDE THE LINE IN ANY ARBITRARY RATIO ALL SORTS OF COMBINATIONS HAD TO BE TRIED THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE EARTH AND MARS TO BE WORKED OUT FOR EACH
3032-19361-0059 WITH UNEXAMPLED DILIGENCE AT LENGTH HE HIT UPON A POINT THAT SEEMED NEARLY RIGHT HE THOUGHT HE HAD FOUND THE TRUTH BUT NO BEFORE LONG THE POSITION OF THE PLANET AS CALCULATED
3032-19361-0060 AND AS RECORDED BY TYCHO
3032-19361-0061 OR ABOUT ONE EIGHTH OF A DEGREE
3032-19361-0062 HE WOULD YET FIND OUT THE LAW OF THE UNIVERSE HE PROCEEDED TO SEE IF BY MAKING THE PLANET LIBRATE OR THE PLANE OF ITS ORBIT TILT UP AND DOWN ANYTHING COULD BE DONE
3032-19361-0063 HE WAS REWARDED BY FINDING THAT AT ANY RATE THE PLANE OF THE ORBIT DID NOT TILT UP AND DOWN IT WAS FIXED
3032-19361-0064 HE DIVIDED THE ORBIT INTO TRIANGLES AND TRIED IF MAKING THE TRIANGLES EQUAL WOULD DO A GREAT PIECE OF LUCK THEY DID BEAUTIFULLY THE RATE OF DESCRIPTION OF AREAS NOT ARCS
3032-19361-0065 FRESH LITTLE ERRORS APPEARED AND GREW IN IMPORTANCE THUS HE ANNOUNCES IT HIMSELF WHILE THUS TRIUMPHING OVER MARS AND PREPARING FOR HIM AS FOR ONE ALREADY VANQUISHED
3032-19361-0066 A DESPISED CAPTIVE HAS BURST ALL THE CHAINS OF THE EQUATIONS AND BROKEN FORTH FROM THE PRISONS OF THE TABLES STILL A PART OF THE TRUTH HAD BEEN GAINED
3032-19361-0067 AND EVERY PHILOSOPHER SINCE ARISTOTLE HAD BEEN WRONG THAT CIRCULAR MOTION WAS NOT THE PERFECT AND NATURAL MOTION BUT THAT PLANETS MIGHT MOVE IN SOME OTHER CLOSED CURVE
3032-19361-0068 SUPPOSE HE TRIED AN OVAL WELL THERE ARE A GREAT VARIETY OF OVALS AND SEVERAL WERE TRIED WITH THE RESULT THAT THEY COULD BE MADE TO ANSWER BETTER THAN A CIRCLE BUT STILL WERE NOT RIGHT
3032-19361-0069 NOW HOWEVER THE GEOMETRICAL AND MATHEMATICAL DIFFICULTIES OF CALCULATION WHICH BEFORE HAD BEEN TEDIOUS AND OPPRESSIVE THREATENED TO BECOME OVERWHELMING
3032-19361-0070 THAT WHEN HE MADE THE CIRCUIT OVAL HIS LAW OF EQUABLE DESCRIPTION OF AREAS BROKE DOWN THAT SEEMED TO REQUIRE THE CIRCULAR ORBIT AND YET NO CIRCULAR ORBIT WAS QUITE ACCURATE
3032-19361-0071 AND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OPTICAL INEQUALITY OF MARS
3032-19361-0072 THIS COINCIDENCE IN HIS OWN WORDS WOKE HIM OUT OF SLEEP AND FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER IMPELLED HIM INSTANTLY TO TRY MAKING THE PLANET OSCILLATE IN THE DIAMETER OF ITS EPICYCLE
3032-19361-0073 STRANGE THAT HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE IT WAS A FAMOUS CURVE FOR THE GREEK GEOMETERS HAD STUDIED IT AS ONE OF THE SECTIONS OF A CONE BUT IT WAS NOT SO WELL KNOWN IN KEPLER'S TIME
3032-19361-0074 IF THE SUN WAS IN ONE FOCUS SO MOVING THE PLANET IN A SELECTED ELLIPSE WITH THE SUN IN ONE FOCUS AT A SPEED GIVEN BY THE EQUABLE AREA DESCRIPTION
3032-19361-0075 OF THE STEPS BY WHICH KEPLER ROSE TO HIS GREAT GENERALIZATIONS THE TWO LAWS WHICH HAVE IMMORTALIZED HIS NAME ALL THE COMPLICATIONS OF EPICYCLE EQUANT DEFERENT EXCENTRIC
3032-19361-0076 HE HAD BEEN THERE ELEVEN YEARS BUT THEY HAD BEEN HARD YEARS OF POVERTY AND HE COULD LEAVE WITHOUT REGRET
3032-19361-0077 BUT IT WAS THE ONLY THING FOR WHICH PEOPLE WOULD PAY HIM AND ON IT AFTER A FASHION HE LIVED WE DO NOT FIND THAT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE EVER PROSPEROUS
3032-19361-0078 AND THOUGH EIGHT THOUSAND CROWNS WERE DUE TO HIM FROM BOHEMIA HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO GET THEM PAID ABOUT THIS TIME OCCURRED A SINGULAR INTERRUPTION TO HIS WORK HIS OLD MOTHER
3032-19361-0079 OF WHOSE FIERCE TEMPER SOMETHING HAS ALREADY BEEN INDICATED HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A LAW SUIT FOR SOME YEARS NEAR THEIR OLD HOME
3032-19361-0080 A CHANGE OF JUDGE HAVING IN PROCESS OF TIME OCCURRED THE DEFENDANT SAW HIS WAY TO TURN THE TABLES ON THE OLD LADY BY ACCUSING HER OF SORCERY SHE WAS SENT TO PRISON AND CONDEMNED TO THE TORTURE
3032-19361-0081 WITH THE USUAL INTELLIGENT IDEA OF EXTRACTING A VOLUNTARY CONFESSION KEPLER HAD TO HURRY FROM LINZ TO INTERPOSE HE SUCCEEDED IN SAVING HER FROM THE TORTURE
3032-19361-0082 HER SPIRIT HOWEVER WAS UNBROKEN FOR NO SOONER WAS SHE RELEASED THAN SHE COMMENCED A FRESH ACTION AGAINST HER ACCUSER BUT FRESH TROUBLE WAS AVERTED BY THE DEATH OF THE POOR OLD DAME
3032-19361-0083 AT THE AGE OF NEARLY EIGHTY THIS NARRATION RENDERS THE UNFLAGGING ENERGY SHOWN BY HER SON IN HIS MATHEMATICAL WRESTLINGS LESS SURPRISING INTERSPERSED WITH THESE DOMESTIC TROUBLES
3032-19361-0084 IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NO CONNECTION THAT IT WAS PURELY IMAGINARY LIKE HIS OLD IDEA OF THE LAW OF THE SUCCESSIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS AND LIKE SO MANY OTHERS OF THE GUESSES AND FANCIES
3032-19361-0085 OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN OR ONCE MORE THE SPEED OF EACH PLANET IN ITS ORBIT IS AS THE INVERSE SQUARE ROOT OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN THE PRODUCT OF THE DISTANCE INTO THE SQUARE OF THE SPEED
3032-19361-0086 WHICH I NAMED BEFORE I WAS SURE OF MY DISCOVERY WHAT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO I URGED AS A THING TO BE SOUGHT
3032-19361-0087 BEYOND MY MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS IT IS NOT EIGHTEEN MONTHS SINCE I GOT THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF LIGHT THREE MONTHS SINCE THE DAWN VERY FEW DAYS SINCE THE UNVEILED SUN
3032-19361-0088 MOST ADMIRABLE TO GAZE UPON BURST UPON ME NOTHING HOLDS ME I WILL INDULGE MY SACRED FURY I WILL TRIUMPH OVER MANKIND BY THE HONEST CONFESSION
3032-19361-0089 AS GOD HAS WAITED SIX THOUSAND YEARS FOR AN OBSERVER SOON AFTER THIS GREAT WORK HIS THIRD BOOK APPEARED IT WAS AN EPITOME OF THE COPERNICAN THEORY
3032-19361-0090 A CLEAR AND FAIRLY POPULAR EXPOSITION OF IT WHICH HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING AT ONCE SUPPRESSED AND PLACED ON THE LIST OF BOOKS PROHIBITED BY THE CHURCH SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE WORK OF COPERNICUS HIMSELF
3032-19361-0091 TO UNDERTAKE ANOTHER BOOK STILL HE WORKED ON AT THE RUDOLPHINE TABLES OF TYCHO AND ULTIMATELY WITH SOME SMALL HELP FROM VIENNA COMPLETED THEM BUT HE COULD NOT GET THE MEANS TO PRINT THEM
3032-19361-0092 THEY WERE THE FIRST REALLY ACCURATE TABLES WHICH NAVIGATORS EVER POSSESSED THEY WERE THE PRECURSORS OF OUR PRESENT NAUTICAL ALMANACK AFTER THIS THE GRAND DUKE OF TUSCANY
3032-19361-0093 ATTENDED THE IMPERIAL MEETING AND PLEADED HIS OWN CAUSE BUT IT WAS ALL FRUITLESS AND EXHAUSTED BY THE JOURNEY WEAKENED BY OVER STUDY AND DISHEARTENED BY THE FAILURE HE CAUGHT A FEVER
3032-19361-0094 AND DIED IN HIS FIFTY NINTH YEAR HIS BODY WAS BURIED AT RATISBON AND A CENTURY AGO A PROPOSAL WAS MADE TO ERECT A MARBLE MONUMENT TO HIS MEMORY BUT NOTHING WAS DONE
3032-19361-0095 IT MATTERS LITTLE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER GERMANY HAVING ALMOST REFUSED HIM BREAD DURING HIS LIFE SHOULD
3032-19361-0096 THE TOOLS BY WHICH HE DID HIS WORK WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM FREDERICK AND SOPHIA OF DENMARK AND RUDOLPH OF BOHEMIA ARE THEREFORE TO BE REMEMBERED AS CO WORKERS WITH HIM KEPLER
3032-19361-0097 WITH HIS ILL HEALTH AND INFERIOR PHYSICAL ENERGY WAS UNABLE TO COMMAND THE LIKE ADVANTAGES MUCH NEVERTHELESS HE DID MORE ONE CANNOT BUT FEEL HE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD HE BEEN PROPERLY HELPED
3032-19361-0098 OF ALL THE STEPS UNSUCCESSFUL AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL BY WHICH HE TRAVELLED HE MAPS OUT HIS ROUTE LIKE A TRAVELLER IN FACT HE COMPARES HIMSELF TO COLUMBUS OR MAGELLAN
3032-19361-0099 VOYAGING INTO UNKNOWN LANDS AND RECORDING HIS WANDERING ROUTE THIS BEING REMEMBERED IT WILL BE FOUND THAT HIS METHODS DO NOT DIFFER SO UTTERLY FROM THOSE USED BY OTHER PHILOSOPHERS IN LIKE CASE
3032-19361-0100 HIS IMAGINATION WAS PERHAPS MORE LUXURIANT AND WAS ALLOWED FREER PLAY THAN MOST MEN'S BUT IT WAS NEVERTHELESS ALWAYS CONTROLLED BY RIGID EXAMINATION
3032-19361-0101 AND COMPARISON OF HYPOTHESES WITH FACT BREWSTER SAYS OF HIM ARDENT RESTLESS BURNING TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BY DISCOVERY HE ATTEMPTED EVERYTHING
3032-19361-0102 AND ONCE HAVING OBTAINED A GLIMPSE OF A CLUE NO LABOUR WAS TOO HARD IN FOLLOWING OR VERIFYING IT A FEW OF HIS ATTEMPTS SUCCEEDED A MULTITUDE FAILED
3032-19361-0103 THOSE WHICH FAILED SEEM TO US NOW FANCIFUL THOSE WHICH SUCCEEDED APPEAR TO US SUBLIME BUT HIS METHODS WERE THE SAME WHEN IN SEARCH OF WHAT REALLY EXISTED HE SOMETIMES FOUND IT
3032-19361-0104 IT IS NECESSARY FOR US NOW TO CONSIDER SOME SCIENCE STILL IN ITS INFANCY ASTRONOMY IS SO CLEAR AND SO THOROUGHLY EXPLORED NOW THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT ONESELF INTO A CONTEMPORARY ATTITUDE
3032-19361-0105 TO SUPERNATURAL AGENCY WE HAVE HAD OUR COPERNICAN ERA NOT PERHAPS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL BUT STILL ACHIEVED
3032-19361-0106 AND RUDE WEATHER PREDICTIONS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC ARE ROUGHLY POSSIBLE BAROMETERS AND THERMOMETERS AND ANEMOMETERS AND ALL THEIR TRIBE REPRESENT THE ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE ISLAND OF HUEN
3032-19361-0107 AND OUR NUMEROUS METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORIES WITH THEIR CONTINUAL RECORD OF EVENTS
3032-19361-0108 OBSERVATION IS HEAPED ON OBSERVATION TABLES ARE COMPILED VOLUMES ARE FILLED WITH DATA THE HOURS OF SUNSHINE ARE RECORDED THE FALL OF RAIN
3032-19361-0109 IN EVOLVING THE BEGINNINGS OF LAW AND ORDER FROM THE MIDST OF ALL THIS CHAOS PERHAPS AS A MAN HE MAY NOT COME BUT HIS ERA WILL COME THROUGH THIS STAGE THE SCIENCE MUST PASS
3032-19361-0110 ERE IT IS READY FOR THE COMMANDING INTELLECT OF A NEWTON BUT WHAT A WORK IT WILL BE FOR THE MAN WHOEVER HE BE THAT UNDERTAKES IT A FEARFUL MONOTONOUS GRIND OF CALCULATION
3032-19361-0111 HYPOTHESIS HYPOTHESIS CALCULATION A DESPERATE AND GROPING ENDEAVOUR TO RECONCILE THEORIES WITH FACTS A LIFE OF SUCH LABOUR CROWNED BY THREE BRILLIANT DISCOVERIES
