1649-68762-0000 CHAPTER THREE DON QUIXOTE WHEN KENNETH GOT HOME HE TOLD MISTER WATSON OF HIS DISCOVERY AND ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO WRITE TO THE SIGN PAINTER AND FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE DONE THE LAWYER LAUGHED HEARTILY AT HIS YOUNG FRIEND'S WHIM BUT AGREED TO HELP HIM
1649-68762-0001 NO MISTER WATSON I'M SET ON THIS IT'S A CRIME TO ALLOW THESE SIGNS TO FLAUNT THEMSELVES IN OUR PRETTIEST SCENES MY INSTINCT REVOLTS AT THE DESECRATION BESIDES
1649-68762-0002 TRUE ENOUGH IF YOU'RE SERIOUS KEN I'LL FRANKLY SAY THE THING CAN'T BE DONE YOU MAY PERHAPS BUY THE PRIVILEGE OF MAINTAINING THE ROCKS OF THE GLEN FREE FROM ADVERTISING BUT THE ADVERTISERS WILL PAINT MORE SIGNS ON ALL THE APPROACHES AND YOU WON'T HAVE GAINED MUCH
1649-68762-0003 I'LL DRIVE EVERY ADVERTISING SIGN OUT OF THIS COUNTRY IMPOSSIBLE THE GREAT CORPORATIONS WHO CONTROL THESE INDUSTRIES MAKE THEIR FORTUNES BY THIS STYLE OF ADVERTISING THE RURAL DISTRICTS ARE THEIR STRONGHOLDS AND THEY MUST ADVERTISE OR THEY CAN'T SELL THEIR PRODUCTS
1649-68762-0004 LET THEM ADVERTISE IN DECENT WAYS THEN WHAT RIGHT HAS ANY SOAP MAKER TO FLAUNT HIS WARES IN MY FACE WHETHER I'M INTERESTED IN THEM OR NOT THE RIGHT OF CUSTOM
1649-68762-0005 PEOPLE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THESE THINGS SO LONG THAT THE MANUFACTURERS CONSIDER THEMSELVES JUSTIFIED IN COVERING EVERY BARN ROCK AND FENCE WITH THEIR SIGNS I SEE NO WAY TO STOP THEM NOR I AT PRESENT BUT THERE MUST BE A WAY
1649-68762-0006 DRIVE OUT ONE AND ANOTHER WILL TAKE HIS PLACE THEY PAY LIBERALLY FOR LOCATIONS PSHAW TEN DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ROCK AS BIG AS A BARN BUT THEY RENT THOUSANDS OF SUCH POSITIONS AND IN THE AGGREGATE OUR FARMERS GET LARGE SUMS FROM THEM
1649-68762-0007 AND RUIN THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR HOMES AND FARMS MISTER WATSON SMILED THEY'RE NOT ARTISTS KEN THEY CAN'T REALIZE ON APPEARANCES BUT THEY CAN USE THE MONEY THE SIGNS BRING THEM THEY NEED TO BE EDUCATED THAT'S ALL
1649-68762-0008 THESE FARMERS SEEM VERY HONEST DECENT FELLOWS THEY ARE KEN I WISH YOU KNEW THEM BETTER SO DO I MISTER WATSON THIS CAMPAIGN OUGHT TO BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER FOR I MEAN TO GET THEM TO HELP ME YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY THEM I'M AFRAID
1649-68762-0009 NOT ALL OF THEM THERE MUST BE SOME REFINEMENT AMONG THEM BUT THE LAWYER WAS NOT CONVINCED HOWEVER IT WAS NOT HIS DESIRE TO STIFLE THIS NEW BORN ENTHUSIASM OF KENNETH'S EVEN THOUGH HE BELIEVED IT MISDIRECTED
1649-68762-0010 HE WANTED THE YOUNG MAN TO ROUSE HIMSELF AND TAKE AN INTEREST IN LIFE AND IF HIS ANTAGONISM TO ADVERTISING SIGNS WOULD EFFECT THIS
1649-68762-0011 IT WOULD COST THE BOY SOMETHING BUT HE WOULD GAIN HIS MONEY'S WORTH IN EXPERIENCE AFTER A FEW DAYS THE SIGN PAINTER ANSWERED THE LETTER HE WOULD RELINQUISH THE THREE SIGNS IN THE GLEN FOR A PAYMENT OF FIFTY DOLLARS EACH
1649-68762-0012 WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT NO OTHER COMPETING SIGNS WERE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE KENNETH PROMPTLY MAILED A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNT DEMANDED AND EARLY NEXT MORNING STARTED FOR THE GLEN WITH WHAT HE CALLED HIS ELIMINATORS THESE ELIMINATORS CONSISTED OF TWO MEN WITH CANS OF TURPENTINE
1649-68762-0013 AND GASOLINE AND AN EQUIPMENT OF SCRUBBING BRUSHES PARSONS THE FARMER CAME OVER TO WATCH THIS NOVEL PROCEEDING HAPPY IN THE POSSESSION OF THREE CRISP FIVE DOLLAR NOTES GIVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT MADE WITH HIM
1649-68762-0014 ALL DAY THE TWO MEN SCRUBBED THE ROCKS FAITHFULLY ASSISTED AT ODD TIMES BY THEIR IMPATIENT EMPLOYER BUT THE THICK SPLASHES OF PAINT CLUNG DESPERATELY TO THE RUGGED SURFACE OF THE ROCK AND THE TASK WAS A HARD ONE
1649-68762-0015 BUT HIS ENERGY WAS NOT EXHAUSTED NO ONE EVER KNEW WHAT IT COST IN LABOR AND MATERIAL TO ERASE THOSE THREE SIGNS BUT AFTER TEN DAYS THEY HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY AND THE BOY HEAVED A SIGH OF SATISFACTION AND TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO EXTENDING THE CAMPAIGN
1649-68762-0016 ON THE FARM NEAREST TO ELMHURST AT THE NORTH WHICH BELONGED TO A MAN NAMED WEBB WAS A BARN FACING THE ROAD THAT DISPLAYED ON ITS SIDE A TOBACCO SIGN KENNETH INTERVIEWED MISTER WEBB AND FOUND THAT HE RECEIVED NO MONEY FOR THE SIGN BUT THE MAN CONTENDED
1649-68762-0017 AND ACKNOWLEDGED FRANKLY THAT IT WAS A PITY TO DECORATE THEIR PREMISES WITH SIGNS OF PATENT MEDICINES AND QUESTIONABLE SOAPS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM SNEERED AT THE CHAMPION AND MANY REFUSED POINT BLANK TO CONSIDER ANY PROPOSITION TO DISCARD THE ADVERTISEMENTS
1649-68762-0018 INDEED SOME WERE PROUD OF THEM AND BELIEVED IT A MARK OF DISTINCTION TO HAVE THEIR FENCES AND SHEDS ANNOUNCE AN EYE REMEDY OR SEVERAL VARIETIES OF PICKLES MISTER WATSON AT FIRST AN AMUSED OBSERVER OF THE CAMPAIGN SOON BECAME INDIGNANT AT THE WAY THAT KENNETH WAS RIDICULED AND REVILED
1649-68762-0019 NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE NOVEL IDEAS OF THE YOUNG ARTIST AS BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED TO BE AMUSED BY HEARING THE BOYISH MASTER OF ELMHURST LECTURE AT EM SO THEY FILLED THE LITTLE ROOM TO OVERFLOWING AND TO ADD TO THE DIGNITY OF THE PROCEEDINGS
1649-68762-0020 THE HON ERASTUS HOPKINS STATE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE DISTRICT LENT HIS PRESENCE TO THE ASSEMBLAGE NOT THAT THE HONORABLE ERASTUS CARED A FIG ABOUT THIS FOOLISH TALK OF EXTERMINATING ADVERTISING SIGNS HE WAS HIMSELF A LARGE STOCKHOLDER IN A BREAKFAST FOOD FACTORY
1649-68762-0021 WHICH PAINTED SIGNS WHEREVER IT COULD SECURE SPACE THESE SIGNS WERE NOT WORKS OF ART BUT THEY WERE DISTINCTLY HELPFUL TO BUSINESS AND ONLY A FOOL IN THE OPINION OF THE HONORABLE ERASTUS WOULD PROTEST AGAINST THE INEVITABLE WHAT BROUGHT THE LEGISLATOR TO THE MEETING
1649-68762-0022 WAS THE FACT THAT HE WAS COMING FORWARD FOR RE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER AND BELIEVED THAT THIS AFFORDED A GOOD CHANCE TO MEET SOME OF HIS CONSTITUENTS AND MAKE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION SO HE CAME EARLY AND SHOOK HANDS WITH EVERYONE THAT ARRIVED AND AFTERWARD TOOK AS PROMINENT A SEAT AS POSSIBLE INDEED
1649-68762-0023 THE GATHERING HAD AT FIRST THE APPEARANCE OF BEING A POLITICAL ONE SO ENTIRELY DID THE REPRESENTATIVE DOMINATE IT BUT MISTER WATSON TOOK THE PLATFORM AND SHYLY INTRODUCED THE SPEAKER OF THE EVENING THE FARMERS ALL KNEW MISTER WATSON AND LIKED HIM
1649-68762-0024 SO WHEN KENNETH ROSE THEY PREPARED TO LISTEN IN RESPECTFUL SILENCE USUALLY A YOUNG MAN MAKING HIS MAIDEN SPEECH IS SOMEWHAT DIFFIDENT BUT YOUNG FORBES WAS SO THOROUGHLY IN EARNEST AND SO INDIGNANT AT THE OPPOSITION THAT HIS PLANS HAD ENCOUNTERED
1649-68762-0025 THAT HE FORGOT THAT IT WAS HIS FIRST PUBLIC SPEECH AND THOUGHT ONLY OF IMPRESSING HIS HEARERS WITH HIS VIEWS EXULTING IN THE FACT THAT ON THIS OCCASION THEY COULD NOT TALK BACK AS THEY USUALLY DID IN PRIVATE
1649-68762-0026 SO HE EXHORTED THEM EARNESTLY TO KEEP THEIR HOMES BEAUTIFUL AND FREE FROM THE DEGRADATION OF ADVERTISING AND NEVER TO PERMIT GLARING COMMERCIALISM TO MAR THE SCENERY AROUND THEM HE TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BY HIMSELF IN A SHORT TIME
1649-68762-0027 HOW HE HAD REDEEMED THE GLEN FROM ITS DISGRACEFUL CONDITION AND RESTORED IT TO ITS FORMER BEAUTY HE ASKED THEM TO OBSERVE WEBB'S PRETTY HOMESTEAD NO LONGER MARRED BY THE UNSIGHTLY SIGN UPON THE BARN AND THEN
1649-68762-0028 HE APPEALED TO THEM TO HELP HIM IN DRIVING ALL THE ADVERTISING SIGNS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY WHEN HE ENDED THEY APPLAUDED HIS SPEECH MILDLY BUT IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE REASON THAT HE HAD SPOKEN SO FORCIBLY AND WELL THEN
1649-68762-0029 THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS QUICK TO CATCH THE LACK OF SYMPATHY IN THE AUDIENCE STOOD UP AND BEGGED LEAVE TO REPLY TO YOUNG FORBES HE SAID THE OBJECTION TO ADVERTISING SIGNS WAS ONLY A RICH MAN'S ARISTOCRATIC HOBBY
1649-68762-0030 AND THAT IT COULD NOT BE INDULGED IN A DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITY OF HONEST PEOPLE HIS OWN FIRM HE SAID BOUGHT THOUSANDS OF BUSHELS OF OATS FROM THE FARMERS AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE CELEBRATED EAGLE EYE BREAKFAST FOOD THREE PACKAGES FOR A QUARTER
1649-68762-0031 THEY SOLD THIS BREAKFAST FOOD TO THOUSANDS OF FARMERS TO GIVE THEM HEALTH AND STRENGTH TO HARVEST ANOTHER CROP OF OATS THUS HE BENEFITED THE COMMUNITY GOING AND COMING WHAT SHOULD HE NOT ADVERTISE THIS MUTUAL BENEFIT COMMODITY WHEREVER HE PLEASED AND ESPECIALLY AMONG THE FARMERS
1649-68762-0032 WHAT ARISTOCRATIC NOTION COULD PREVENT HIM IT WAS A MIGHTY GOOD THING FOR THE FARMERS TO BE REMINDED BY MEANS OF THE SIGNS ON THEIR BARNS AND FENCES OF THE THINGS THEY NEEDED IN DAILY LIFE IF THE YOUNG MAN AT ELMHURST WOULD LIKE TO BE OF PUBLIC SERVICE
1649-68762-0033 HE MIGHT FIND SOME BETTER WAY TO DO SO THAN BY ADVANCING SUCH CRAZY IDEAS BUT THIS CONTINUED THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS A SUBJECT OF SMALL IMPORTANCE WHAT HE WISHED ESPECIALLY TO CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD SERVED THE DISTRICT FAITHFULLY AS REPRESENTATIVE
1649-68762-0034 AND DESERVED THEIR SUFFRAGES FOR RENOMINATION AND THEN HE BEGAN TO DISCUSS POLITICAL QUESTIONS IN GENERAL AND HIS OWN MERITS IN PARTICULAR SO THAT KENNETH AND MISTER WATSON DISGUSTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HAD CAPTURED THE MEETING
1649-68762-0035 LEFT THE SCHOOL HOUSE AND INDIGNANTLY RETURNED TO ELMHURST THIS MAN HOPKINS SAID MISTER WATSON ANGRILY IS NOT A GENTLEMAN HE'S AN IMPERTINENT MEDDLER HE RUINED ANY GOOD EFFECT MY SPEECH MIGHT HAVE CREATED SAID KENNETH GLOOMILY
1649-68762-0036 GIVE IT UP MY BOY ADVISED THE ELDER MAN LAYING A KINDLY HAND ON THE YOUTH'S SHOULDER IT REALLY ISN'T WORTH THE STRUGGLE BUT I CAN'T GIVE IT UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF BEATEN PROTESTED KENNETH ALMOST READY TO WEEP WITH DISAPPOINTMENT
1649-68762-0037 WELL WELL LET'S THINK IT OVER KEN AND SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE PERHAPS THAT RASCALLY HOPKINS WAS RIGHT WHEN HE ADVISED YOU TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY I CAN'T DO BETTER THAN TO MAKE IT CLEAN TO DO AWAY WITH THESE DISREPUTABLE SIGNS SAID THE BOY STUBBORNLY
1649-68762-0038 KENNETH FLUSHED RED HE WAS BY NATURE SHY AND RETIRING TO A DEGREE ONLY HIS PENT UP ENTHUSIASM HAD CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE ORDEAL AND NOW THAT IT WAS OVER HE WAS CHAGRINED TO THINK THAT THE SPEECH HAD BEEN SO INEFFECTIVE
