4148-134149-0000 BECAUSE HE CAN'T GO AT TWICE SAID THE OTHER PROFESSOR THE PROFESSOR GENTLY CLAPPED HIS HANDS ISN'T HE WONDERFUL HE SAID TO SYLVIE
4148-134149-0001 THIS REMARK WOKE UP BRUNO SUDDENLY AND COMPLETELY I DON'T WANT TO BE DIVIDED HE SAID DECISIVELY IT DOES VERY WELL ON A DIAGRAM SAID THE OTHER PROFESSOR I COULD SHOW IT YOU IN A MINUTE ONLY THE CHALK'S A LITTLE BLUNT
4148-134149-0002 TAKE CARE SYLVIE ANXIOUSLY EXCLAIMED AS HE BEGAN RATHER CLUMSILY TO POINT IT YOU'LL CUT YOUR FINGER OFF IF YOU HOLD THE KNIFE SO IF OO CUTS IT OFF WILL OO GIVE IT TO ME PLEASE BRUNO THOUGHTFULLY ADDED
4148-134149-0003 IT'S LIKE THIS SAID THE OTHER PROFESSOR HASTILY DRAWING A LONG LINE UPON THE BLACK BOARD AND MARKING THE LETTERS A B AT THE TWO ENDS AND C IN THE MIDDLE LET ME EXPLAIN IT TO YOU IF A B WERE TO BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS AT C
4148-134149-0004 IT WOULD BE DROWNDED BRUNO PRONOUNCED CONFIDENTLY THE OTHER PROFESSOR GASPED WHAT WOULD BE DROWNDED WHY THE BUMBLE BEE OF COURSE SAID BRUNO AND THE TWO BITS WOULD SINK DOWN IN THE SEA
4148-134149-0005 HERE THE PROFESSOR INTERFERED AS THE OTHER PROFESSOR WAS EVIDENTLY TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO GO ON WITH HIS DIAGRAM WHEN I SAID IT WOULD HURT HIM I WAS MERELY REFERRING TO THE ACTION OF THE NERVES THE OTHER PROFESSOR BRIGHTENED UP IN A MOMENT
4148-134149-0006 THE ACTION OF THE NERVES HE BEGAN EAGERLY IS CURIOUSLY SLOW IN SOME PEOPLE I HAD A FRIEND ONCE THAT IF YOU BURNT HIM WITH A RED HOT POKER IT WOULD TAKE YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE HE FELT IT AND IF YOU ONLY PINCHED HIM QUERIED SYLVIE
4148-134149-0007 THEN IT WOULD TAKE EVER SO MUCH LONGER OF COURSE IN FACT I DOUBT IF THE MAN HIMSELF WOULD EVER FEEL IT AT ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN MIGHT I WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE THE GRANDCHILD OF A PINCHED GRANDFATHER WOULD YOU MISTER SIR BRUNO WHISPERED IT MIGHT COME JUST WHEN YOU WANTED TO BE HAPPY
4148-134149-0008 THAT WOULD BE AWKWARD I ADMITTED TAKING IT QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT HE HAD SO SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME BUT DON'T YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE HAPPY BRUNO NOT ALWAYS BRUNO SAID THOUGHTFULLY SOMETIMES WHEN I'S TOO HAPPY I WANTS TO BE A LITTLE MISERABLE
4148-134149-0009 AND SYLVIE SETS ME SOME LESSONS THEN IT'S ALL RIGHT I'M SORRY YOU DON'T LIKE LESSONS I SAID YOU SHOULD COPY SYLVIE SHE'S ALWAYS AS BUSY AS THE DAY IS LONG
4148-134149-0010 NO NO SYLVIE CORRECTED HIM YOU'RE AS BUSY AS THE DAY IS SHORT WELL WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BRUNO ASKED MISTER SIR ISN'T THE DAY AS SHORT AS IT'S LONG I MEAN ISN'T IT THE SAME LENGTH
4148-134149-0011 NEVER HAVING CONSIDERED THE QUESTION IN THIS LIGHT I SUGGESTED THAT THEY HAD BETTER ASK THE PROFESSOR AND THEY RAN OFF IN A MOMENT TO APPEAL TO THEIR OLD FRIEND THE PROFESSOR LEFT OFF POLISHING HIS SPECTACLES TO CONSIDER MY DEARS HE SAID AFTER A MINUTE
4148-134149-0012 IF I WAS AS WISE AS THAT I SHOULD HAVE A HEAD ACHE ALL DAY LONG I KNOW I SHOULD YOU APPEAR TO BE TALKING TO SOMEBODY THAT ISN'T HERE THE PROFESSOR SAID TURNING ROUND TO THE CHILDREN WHO IS IT BRUNO LOOKED PUZZLED
4148-134149-0013 THE PROFESSOR LOOKED ANXIOUSLY IN MY DIRECTION AND SEEMED TO LOOK THROUGH AND THROUGH ME WITHOUT SEEING ME THEN WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO HE SAID THERE ISN'T ANYBODY HERE YOU KNOW EXCEPT THE OTHER PROFESSOR AND HE ISN'T HERE HE ADDED WILDLY TURNING ROUND AND ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM
4148-134149-0014 AND HE BEGAN TROTTING ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM LIFTING UP THE CHAIRS AND SHAKING THEM BRUNO TOOK A VERY SMALL BOOK OUT OF THE BOOKCASE OPENED IT AND SHOOK IT IN IMITATION OF THE PROFESSOR HE ISN'T HERE HE SAID
4148-134149-0015 I SHOULD HAVE SHOOKED HIM OUT IF HE'D BEEN IN THERE HAS HE EVER BEEN LOST BEFORE SYLVIE ENQUIRED TURNING UP A CORNER OF THE HEARTH RUG AND PEEPING UNDER IT ONCE BEFORE SAID THE PROFESSOR HE ONCE LOST HIMSELF IN A WOOD AND COULDN'T HE FIND HIS SELF AGAIN SAID BRUNO
4148-134149-0016 WHY DIDN'T HE SHOUT HE'D BE SURE TO HEAR HIS SELF CAUSE HE COULDN'T BE FAR OFF OO KNOW LETS TRY SHOUTING SAID THE PROFESSOR WHAT SHALL WE SHOUT SAID SYLVIE ON SECOND THOUGHTS DON'T SHOUT THE PROFESSOR REPLIED
4148-134149-0017 THE VICE WARDEN MIGHT HEAR YOU HE'S GETTING AWFULLY STRICT
4148-134149-0018 BRUNO SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND BEGAN CRYING HE IS SO CRUEL HE SOBBED
4148-134149-0019 AND SUCH HORRID MEALS WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR DINNER TO DAY SAID THE PROFESSOR A LITTLE PIECE OF A DEAD CROW WAS BRUNO'S MOURNFUL REPLY HE MEANS ROOK PIE SYLVIE EXPLAINED
4148-134149-0020 AND I GOT NUFFIN BUT A CRUST AND I ASKED FOR A ORANGE AND DIDN'T GET IT AND THE POOR LITTLE FELLOW BURIED HIS FACE IN SYLVIE'S LAP WHO KEPT GENTLY STROKING HIS HAIR AS SHE WENT ON IT'S ALL TRUE PROFESSOR DEAR
4148-134149-0021 THEY DO TREAT MY DARLING BRUNO VERY BADLY AND THEY'RE NOT KIND TO ME EITHER SHE ADDED IN A LOWER TONE AS IF THAT WERE A THING OF MUCH LESS IMPORTANCE THE PROFESSOR GOT OUT A LARGE RED SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS EYES I WISH I COULD HELP YOU DEAR CHILDREN HE SAID
4148-134149-0022 BUT WHAT CAN I DO WE KNOW THE WAY TO FAIRYLAND WHERE FATHER'S GONE QUITE WELL SAID SYLVIE IF ONLY THE GARDENER WOULD LET US OUT WON'T HE OPEN THE DOOR FOR YOU SAID THE PROFESSOR NOT FOR US SAID SYLVIE
4148-134149-0023 BUT I'M SURE HE WOULD FOR YOU DO COME AND ASK HIM PROFESSOR DEAR I'LL COME THIS MINUTE SAID THE PROFESSOR BRUNO SAT UP AND DRIED HIS EYES ISN'T HE KIND MISTER SIR HE IS INDEED SAID I
4148-134149-0024 BUT THE PROFESSOR TOOK NO NOTICE OF MY REMARK HE HAD PUT ON A BEAUTIFUL CAP WITH A LONG TASSEL AND WAS SELECTING ONE OF THE OTHER PROFESSOR'S WALKING STICKS FROM A STAND IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM A THICK STICK IN ONE'S HAND MAKES PEOPLE RESPECTFUL HE WAS SAYING TO HIMSELF
4148-134149-0025 AND SECONDLY IF HE'S SEEN THE OTHER PROFESSOR WE SHALL FIND HIM THAT WAY AND IF HE HASN'T WE SHA'N'T
4148-134149-0026 SEE SAID THE PROFESSOR POINTING OUT A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BULL'S EYE HIS IMPERIAL FATNESS HAD ONLY ONE SHOT AT IT AND HE WENT IN JUST HERE BRUNO CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE HOLE COULDN'T GO IN THERE HE WHISPERED TO ME
4148-134149-0027 HE ARE TOO FAT WE HAD NO SORT OF DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE GARDENER THOUGH HE WAS HIDDEN FROM US BY SOME TREES THAT HARSH VOICE OF HIS SERVED TO DIRECT US AND AS WE DREW NEARER
4148-134149-0028 IT MIGHT STICK TO SOMETHING YOU KNOW AND THAT SOMEFIN WOULD HAVE TO GO BY THE POST WHAT EVER IT WAS BRUNO EAGERLY EXCLAIMED SUPPOSE IT WAS A COW WOULDN'T IT BE DREADFUL FOR THE OTHER THINGS AND ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED TO HIM SAID THE PROFESSOR
4148-134149-0029 THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE SONG SO INTERESTING HE MUST HAVE HAD A VERY CURIOUS LIFE SAID SYLVIE YOU MAY SAY THAT THE PROFESSOR HEARTILY REJOINED OF COURSE SHE MAY CRIED BRUNO BY THIS TIME WE HAD COME UP TO THE GARDENER
4148-134149-0030 WHO WAS STANDING ON ONE LEG AS USUAL AND BUSILY EMPLOYED IN WATERING A BED OF FLOWERS WITH AN EMPTY WATERING CAN IT HASN'T GOT NO WATER IN IT BRUNO EXPLAINED TO HIM PULLING HIS SLEEVE TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION IT'S LIGHTER TO HOLD SAID THE GARDENER
4148-134149-0031 A LOT OF WATER IN IT MAKES ONE'S ARMS ACHE AND HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK SINGING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF THE NIGHTS ARE VERY DAMP IN DIGGING THINGS OUT OF THE GROUND WHICH YOU PROBABLY DO NOW AND THEN THE PROFESSOR BEGAN IN A LOUD VOICE
4148-134149-0032 IN MAKING THINGS INTO HEAPS WHICH NO DOUBT YOU OFTEN DO
4148-134149-0033 HAVE YOU EVER HAPPENED TO NOTICE ANOTHER PROFESSOR SOMETHING LIKE ME BUT DIFFERENT NEVER SHOUTED THE GARDENER SO LOUDLY AND VIOLENTLY THAT WE ALL DREW BACK IN ALARM THERE AIN'T SUCH A THING
4148-134149-0034 WE WILL TRY A LESS EXCITING TOPIC THE PROFESSOR MILDLY REMARKED TO THE CHILDREN YOU WERE ASKING WE ASKED HIM TO LET US THROUGH THE GARDEN DOOR SAID SYLVIE BUT HE WOULDN'T BUT PERHAPS HE WOULD FOR YOU
4148-134149-0035 THE PROFESSOR PUT THE REQUEST VERY HUMBLY AND COURTEOUSLY I WOULDN'T MIND LETTING YOU OUT SAID THE GARDENER BUT I MUSTN'T OPEN THE DOOR FOR CHILDREN D'YOU THINK I'D DISOBEY THE RULES NOT FOR ONE AND SIXPENCE
4148-134149-0036 THE PROFESSOR CAUTIOUSLY PRODUCED A COUPLE OF SHILLINGS THAT'LL DO IT THE GARDENER SHOUTED AS HE HURLED THE WATERING CAN ACROSS THE FLOWER BED AND PRODUCED A HANDFUL OF KEYS ONE LARGE ONE AND A NUMBER OF SMALL ONES
4148-134149-0037 BUT LOOK HERE PROFESSOR DEAR WHISPERED SYLVIE HE NEEDN'T OPEN THE DOOR FOR US AT ALL WE CAN GO OUT WITH YOU TRUE DEAR CHILD THE PROFESSOR THANKFULLY REPLIED AS HE REPLACED THE COINS IN HIS POCKET THAT SAVES TWO SHILLINGS
4148-134149-0038 AND HE TOOK THE CHILDREN'S HANDS THAT THEY MIGHT ALL GO OUT TOGETHER WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED THIS HOWEVER DID NOT SEEM A VERY LIKELY EVENT THOUGH THE GARDENER PATIENTLY TRIED ALL THE SMALL KEYS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LAST THE PROFESSOR VENTURED ON A GENTLE SUGGESTION
4148-134149-0039 WHY NOT TRY THE LARGE ONE I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT A DOOR UNLOCKS MUCH MORE NICELY WITH ITS OWN KEY THE VERY FIRST TRIAL OF THE LARGE KEY PROVED A SUCCESS THE GARDENER OPENED THE DOOR AND HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR THE MONEY
4148-134149-0040 THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD YOU ARE ACTING BY RULE HE EXPLAINED IN OPENING THE DOOR FOR ME AND NOW IT'S OPEN WE ARE GOING OUT BY RULE THE RULE OF THREE THE GARDENER LOOKED PUZZLED AND LET US GO OUT
4148-134149-0041 BUT AS HE LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND US WE HEARD HIM SINGING THOUGHTFULLY TO HIMSELF HE THOUGHT HE SAW A GARDEN DOOR THAT OPENED WITH A KEY HE LOOKED AGAIN AND FOUND IT WAS A DOUBLE RULE OF THREE
4148-134149-0042 AND ALL ITS MYSTERY HE SAID IS CLEAR AS DAY TO ME I SHALL NOW RETURN SAID THE PROFESSOR WHEN WE HAD WALKED A FEW YARDS YOU SEE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO READ HERE FOR ALL MY BOOKS ARE IN THE HOUSE
4148-134149-0043 BUT THE CHILDREN STILL KEPT FAST HOLD OF HIS HANDS DO COME WITH US SYLVIE ENTREATED WITH TEARS IN HER EYES WELL WELL SAID THE GOOD NATURED OLD MAN PERHAPS I'LL COME AFTER YOU SOME DAY SOON BUT I MUST GO BACK NOW
