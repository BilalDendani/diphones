8005-113328-0000 HE HAD GROWN RICH IN THE HARDWARE BUSINESS AND WAS A SCHOOL DIRECTOR OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED IN NOTHING BUT FACTS
8005-113328-0001 ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE CARRIED IN HIS POCKET A RULE AND SCALES AND THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
8005-113328-0002 FOR HER IMAGINATION WAS QUITE STARVED UNDER THEIR TEACHINGS
8005-113328-0003 I WISH HE USED TO SAY
8005-113328-0004 AND I WISH I COULD PUT A THOUSAND POUNDS OF GUNPOWDER UNDER THEM AND BLOW THEM ALL UP TOGETHER
8005-113328-0005 AND THE ONLY LOVE SHE KNEW WAS FOR HER SELFISH WORTHLESS BROTHER WHO REPAID HER WITH VERY LITTLE AFFECTION OF THEIR MOTHER THEY SAW VERY LITTLE SHE WAS A THIN WHITE PINK EYED BUNDLE OF SHAWLS FEEBLE AND AILING
8005-113328-0006 AND HAD TOO LITTLE MIND TO OPPOSE HER HUSBAND IN ANYTHING STRANGELY ENOUGH
8005-113328-0007 AND DOWN BENEATH THE FACTS OF HIS SYSTEM HE HAD IT STILL THOUGH IT HAD BEEN COVERED UP SO LONG THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT LEAST OF ALL PERHAPS HIS OWN CHILDREN MISTER GRADGRIND'S INTIMATE FRIEND ONE WHOM HE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO ADMIRE
8005-113328-0008 WAS JOSIAH BOUNDERBY A BIG LOUD STARING MAN WITH A PUFFED HEAD WHOSE SKIN WAS STRETCHED SO TIGHT IT SEEMED TO HOLD HIS EYES OPEN HE OWNED THE COKETOWN MILLS AND A BANK BESIDES AND WAS VERY RICH AND POMPOUS
8005-113328-0009 BOUNDERBY WAS A PRECIOUS HYPOCRITE OF AN ODD SORT
8005-113328-0010 DESERTED BY HIS WICKED MOTHER AND BROUGHT UP A VAGABOND BY A DRUNKEN GRANDMOTHER
8005-113328-0011 AS A MATTER OF FACT HIS GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN A RESPECTABLE HONEST SOUL AND HIS MOTHER HAD PINCHED AND SAVED TO BRING HIM UP DECENTLY HAD GIVEN HIM SOME SCHOOLING AND FINALLY APPRENTICED HIM IN A GOOD TRADE
8005-113328-0012 BUT BOUNDERBY WAS SO UNGRATEFUL AND SO ANXIOUS TO HAVE PEOPLE THINK HE HIMSELF DESERVED ALL THE CREDIT
8005-113328-0013 AND MADE HER LIVE IN A LITTLE SHOP IN THE COUNTRY FORTY MILES FROM COKETOWN BUT IN HER GOOD AND SIMPLE HEART THE OLD WOMAN WAS SO PROUD OF HER SON THAT SHE USED TO SPEND ALL HER LITTLE SAVINGS TO COME INTO TOWN
8005-113328-0014 SOMETIMES WALKING A GOOD PART OF THE WAY CLEANLY AND PLAINLY DRESSED AND WITH HER SPARE SHAWL AND UMBRELLA JUST TO WATCH HIM GO INTO HIS FINE HOUSE OR TO LOOK IN ADMIRATION AT THE MILLS OR THE FINE BANK HE OWNED
8005-113328-0015 ON SUCH OCCASIONS SHE CALLED HERSELF MISSUS PEGLER AND THOUGHT NO ONE ELSE WOULD BE THE WISER THE HOUSE IN WHICH BOUNDERBY LIVED HAD NO ORNAMENTS IT WAS COLD AND LONELY AND RICH
8005-113328-0016 HE MADE HIS MILL HANDS MORE THAN EARN THEIR WAGES AND WHEN ANY OF THEM COMPLAINED HE SNEERED THAT THEY WANTED TO BE FED ON TURTLE SOUP AND VENISON WITH A GOLDEN SPOON BOUNDERBY HAD FOR HOUSEKEEPER A MISSUS SPARSIT
8005-113328-0017 SHE WAS A BUSYBODY AND WHEN SHE SAT OF AN EVENING CUTTING OUT EMBROIDERY WITH SHARP SCISSORS
8005-113328-0018 PICKING OUT THE EYES OF A VERY TOUGH LITTLE BIRD IN HER OWN MIND SHE HAD SET HER CAP AT BOUNDERBY SO FIRMLY HAD MISTER GRADGRIND PUT HIS TRUST IN THE GOSPEL OF FACTS WHICH HE HAD TAUGHT LOUISA
8005-113328-0019 AND TOM THAT HE WAS GREATLY SHOCKED ONE DAY TO CATCH THEM INSTEAD OF STUDYING ANY ONE OF THE DRY SCIENCES ENDING IN OLOGY WHICH HE MADE THEM LEARN
8005-113328-0020 ALONG THE ROAD AT THE PERFORMANCE OF A TRAVELING CIRCUS THE CIRCUS WHICH WAS RUN BY A MAN NAMED SLEARY
8005-113328-0021 THE PEGASUS'S ARMS THE SHOW WAS GIVEN EVERY DAY AND AT THE MOMENT OF MISTER GRADGRIND'S APPEARANCE ONE SIGNOR JUPE THE CLOWN WAS SHOWING THE TRICKS OF HIS TRAINED DOG MERRYLEGS
8005-113328-0022 AND ENTERTAINING THE AUDIENCE WITH HIS CHOICEST JOKES MISTER GRADGRIND DUMB WITH AMAZEMENT SEIZED BOTH LOUISA AND TOM AND LED THEM HOME REPEATING AT INTERVALS WITH INDIGNATION
8005-113328-0023 HE REMINDED MISTER GRADGRIND THAT THERE WAS AN EVIL INFLUENCE IN THE SCHOOL THE CHILDREN ATTENDED WHICH NO DOUBT HAD LED THEM TO SUCH IDLE PURSUITS THIS EVIL INFLUENCE BEING THE LITTLE DAUGHTER OF JUPE THE CIRCUS CLOWN
8005-113328-0024 THE NAME OF THE CLOWN'S LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS CECELIA BUT EVERY ONE CALLED HER SISSY SHE WAS A DARK EYED DARK HAIRED APPEALING CHILD FROWNED UPON BY MISTER M'CHOAKUMCHILD THE SCHOOLMASTER
8005-113328-0025 BECAUSE SOMEHOW MANY FIGURES WOULD NOT STAY IN HER HEAD AT ONE TIME WHEN THE CIRCUS FIRST CAME HER FATHER WHO LOVED HER VERY MUCH
8005-113328-0026 MISTER GRADGRIND HAD CONSENTED NOW HOWEVER AT BOUNDERBY'S ADVICE HE WISHED HE HAD NOT DONE SO AND STARTED OFF WITH THE OTHER TO THE PEGASUS'S ARMS TO FIND SIGNOR JUPE AND DENY TO LITTLE SISSY THE RIGHT OF ANY MORE SCHOOLING
8005-113328-0027 POOR JUPE HAD BEEN IN GREAT TROUBLE THAT DAY
8005-113328-0028 HIS JOINTS WERE GETTING STIFF HE MISSED IN HIS TUMBLING AND HE COULD NO LONGER MAKE THE PEOPLE LAUGH AS HE HAD ONCE DONE
8005-113328-0029 HE HAD THEREFORE MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE THE COMPANY AND DISAPPEAR
8005-113328-0030 LOVING HER AS HE DID HE DECIDED TO LEAVE HER THERE
8005-113328-0031 HE HAD COME TO THIS MELANCHOLY CONCLUSION THIS VERY DAY AND HAD SENT SISSY OUT ON AN ERRAND SO THAT HE MIGHT SLIP AWAY ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DOG MERRYLEGS WHILE SHE WAS ABSENT
8005-113328-0032 SISSY WAS RETURNING WHEN SHE MET MISTER GRADGRIND AND BOUNDERBY AND CAME WITH THEM TO FIND HER FATHER BUT AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE SHE MET ONLY SYMPATHIZING LOOKS
8005-113328-0033 THEY TOLD HER AS GENTLY AS THEY COULD BUT POOR SISSY WAS AT FIRST BROKEN HEARTED IN HER GRIEF AND WAS COMFORTED ONLY BY THE ASSURANCE THAT HER FATHER WOULD CERTAINLY COME BACK TO HER BEFORE LONG
8005-113328-0034 HE SAW HERE AN EXCELLENT CHANCE TO PUT HIS SYSTEM TO THE TEST TO TAKE THIS UNTAUGHT GIRL AND BRING HER UP FROM THE START ENTIRELY ON FACTS WOULD BE A GOOD EXPERIMENT WITH THIS IN VIEW THEN HE PROPOSED TO TAKE SISSY TO HIS HOUSE
8005-113328-0035 AND TO CARE FOR AND TEACH HER PROVIDED
8005-113328-0036 SISSY KNEW HOW ANXIOUS HER FATHER HAD BEEN TO HAVE HER LEARN
8005-113328-0037 AND SET TO WORK UPON FACTS BUT ALAS MISTER GRADGRIND'S EDUCATION SEEMED TO MAKE SISSY LOW SPIRITED BUT NO WISER EVERY DAY SHE WATCHED AND LONGED FOR SOME MESSAGE FROM HER FATHER BUT NONE CAME
8005-113328-0038 SHE WAS LOVING AND LOVABLE AND LOUISA LIKED HER AND COMFORTED HER AS WELL AS SHE COULD
8005-113328-0039 SEVERAL YEARS WENT BY SISSY'S FATHER HAD NEVER RETURNED SHE HAD GROWN INTO A QUIET LOVELY GIRL THE ONLY RAY OF LIGHT IN THAT GLOOMY HOME MISTER GRADGRIND HAD REALIZED ONE OF HIS AMBITIONS
8005-113328-0040 HAD BEEN ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT AND NOW SPENT MUCH TIME IN LONDON
8005-113328-0041 TOM HAD GROWN TO BE A YOUNG MAN A SELFISH AND IDLE ONE AND BOUNDERBY HAD MADE HIM A CLERK IN HIS BANK LOUISA NOT BLIND TO HER BROTHER'S
8005-113328-0042 IN THIS TIME AN ESPECIAL OBJECT OF BOUNDERBY'S NOTICE INDEED THE MILL OWNER HAD DETERMINED TO MARRY HER LOUISA HAD ALWAYS BEEN REPELLED BY HIS COARSENESS AND ROUGH WAYS AND WHEN HE PROPOSED FOR HER
8005-113328-0043 HAND SHE SHRANK FROM THE THOUGHT IF HER FATHER HAD EVER ENCOURAGED HER CONFIDENCE
8005-113328-0044 BUT TO MISTER GRADGRIND MARRIAGE WAS ONLY A COLD FACT WITH NO ROMANCE IN IT AND HIS MANNER CHILLED HER TOM IN HIS UTTER SELFISHNESS THOUGHT ONLY OF WHAT A GOOD THING IT WOULD BE FOR HIM IF HIS SISTER MARRIED HIS EMPLOYER
8005-113328-0045 AND URGED IT ON HER WITH NO REGARD WHATEVER FOR HER OWN LIKING AT LENGTH
8005-113328-0046 THAT COULD NOT BE PUT DOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE
8005-113328-0047 AND BELIEVING THAT AT LEAST IT WOULD HELP TOM SHE CONSENTED SHE MARRIED BOUNDERBY THE RICHEST MAN IN COKETOWN AND WENT TO LIVE IN HIS FINE HOUSE WHILE MISSUS SPARSIT THE HOUSEKEEPER
