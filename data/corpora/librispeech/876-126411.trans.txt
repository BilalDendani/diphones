876-126411-0000 THE STORY WAS RUNNING IN HIS HEAD AT BREAKFAST AND AS HE TOOK HIS THIRD CUP OF TEA HE SAID DREAMILY I WISH THERE WERE RED INDIANS IN ENGLAND NOT BIG ONES YOU KNOW BUT LITTLE ONES JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT SIZE FOR US TO FIGHT
876-126411-0001 THEY FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAD DONE IT AGAIN FOR THE PSAMMEAD WHICH WAS VERY CROSS AND SLEEPY SAID OH DON'T BOTHER ME YOU'VE HAD YOUR WISH I DIDN'T KNOW IT SAID CYRIL
876-126411-0002 DON'T YOU REMEMBER YESTERDAY SAID THE SAND FAIRY STILL MORE DISAGREEABLY YOU ASKED ME TO LET YOU HAVE YOUR WISHES WHEREVER YOU HAPPENED TO BE AND YOU WISHED THIS MORNING AND YOU'VE GOT IT OH HAVE WE SAID ROBERT WHAT IS IT
876-126411-0003 SO YOU'VE FORGOTTEN SAID THE PSAMMEAD BEGINNING TO BURROW NEVER MIND YOU'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH AND I WISH YOU JOY OF IT A NICE THING YOU'VE LET YOURSELVES IN FOR WE ALWAYS DO SOMEHOW SAID JANE SADLY
876-126411-0004 AND NOW THE ODD THING WAS THAT NO ONE COULD REMEMBER ANYONE'S HAVING WISHED FOR ANYTHING THAT MORNING THE WISH ABOUT THE RED INDIANS HAD NOT STUCK IN ANYONE'S HEAD IT WAS A MOST ANXIOUS MORNING EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT HAD BEEN WISHED FOR
876-126411-0005 AND NO ONE COULD AND EVERYONE KEPT EXPECTING SOMETHING AWFUL TO HAPPEN EVERY MINUTE IT WAS MOST AGITATING THEY KNEW FROM WHAT THE PSAMMEAD HAD SAID THAT THEY MUST HAVE WISHED FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN USUALLY UNDESIRABLE
876-126411-0006 AND SAT DOWN FLAT ON THE CARPET OH PUSSY HOW AWFUL IT WAS INDIANS HE WISHED FOR CYRIL AT BREAKFAST DON'T YOU REMEMBER HE SAID I WISH THERE WERE RED INDIANS IN ENGLAND AND NOW THERE ARE
876-126411-0007 AND THEY'RE GOING ABOUT SCALPING PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY LIKE AS NOT PERHAPS THEY'RE ONLY IN NORTHUMBERLAND AND DURHAM SAID JANE SOOTHINGLY IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT IT COULD REALLY HURT PEOPLE MUCH TO BE SCALPED SO FAR AWAY AS THAT
876-126411-0008 DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT SAID ANTHEA THE SAMMYADD SAID WE'D LET OURSELVES IN FOR A NICE THING THAT MEANS THEY'LL COME HERE AND SUPPOSE THEY SCALPED THE LAMB PERHAPS THE SCALPING WOULD COME RIGHT AGAIN AT SUNSET SAID JANE
876-126411-0009 BUT SHE DID NOT SPEAK SO HOPEFULLY AS USUAL NOT IT SAID ANTHEA THE THINGS THAT GROW OUT OF THE WISHES DON'T GO LOOK AT THE FIFTEEN SHILLINGS PUSSY
876-126411-0010 I'M GOING TO BREAK SOMETHING AND YOU MUST LET ME HAVE EVERY PENNY OF MONEY YOU'VE GOT THE INDIANS WILL COME HERE DON'T YOU SEE THAT SPITEFUL PSAMMEAD AS GOOD AS SAID SO YOU SEE WHAT MY PLAN IS COME ON JANE DID NOT SEE AT ALL
876-126411-0011 BUT SHE FOLLOWED HER SISTER MEEKLY INTO THEIR MOTHER'S BEDROOM ANTHEA LIFTED DOWN THE HEAVY WATER JUG
876-126411-0012 SHE CARRIED IT INTO THE DRESSING ROOM AND CAREFULLY EMPTIED THE WATER OUT OF IT INTO THE BATH THEN SHE TOOK THE JUG BACK INTO THE BEDROOM AND DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR YOU KNOW HOW A JUG ALWAYS BREAKS IF YOU HAPPEN TO DROP IT BY ACCIDENT
876-126411-0013 IF YOU HAPPEN TO DROP IT ON PURPOSE IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT ANTHEA DROPPED THAT JUG THREE TIMES AND IT WAS AS UNBROKEN AS EVER SO AT LAST SHE HAD TO TAKE HER FATHER'S BOOT TREE AND BREAK THE JUG WITH THAT IN COLD BLOOD
876-126411-0014 IT WAS HEARTLESS WORK NEXT SHE BROKE OPEN THE MISSIONARY BOX WITH THE POKER JANE TOLD HER THAT IT WAS WRONG OF COURSE BUT ANTHEA SHUT HER LIPS VERY TIGHT AND THEN SAID DON'T BE SILLY IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
876-126411-0015 THERE WAS NOT VERY MUCH IN THE MISSIONARY BOX
876-126411-0016 THIS MADE OVER ELEVEN SHILLINGS AS YOU WILL EASILY SEE ANTHEA TIED UP THE MONEY IN A CORNER OF HER POCKET HANDKERCHIEF COME ON JANE SHE SAID AND RAN DOWN TO THE FARM SHE KNEW THAT THE FARMER WAS GOING INTO ROCHESTER THAT AFTERNOON
876-126411-0017 IN FACT IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED THAT HE WAS TO TAKE THE FOUR CHILDREN WITH HIM THEY HAD PLANNED THIS IN THE HAPPY HOUR WHEN THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GET THAT HUNDRED POUNDS IN TWO SHILLING PIECES OUT OF THE PSAMMEAD
876-126411-0018 THEY HAD ARRANGED TO PAY THE FARMER TWO SHILLINGS EACH FOR THE RIDE NOW ANTHEA HASTILY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THEY COULD NOT GO BUT WOULD HE TAKE MARTHA AND THE BABY INSTEAD HE AGREED
876-126411-0019 BUT HE WAS NOT PLEASED TO GET ONLY HALF A CROWN INSTEAD OF EIGHT SHILLINGS THEN THE GIRLS RAN HOME AGAIN ANTHEA WAS AGITATED BUT NOT FLURRIED WHEN SHE CAME TO THINK IT OVER AFTERWARDS SHE COULD NOT HELP SEEING THAT SHE HAD ACTED
876-126411-0020 WITH THE MOST FAR SEEING PROMPTITUDE
876-126411-0021 SHE FETCHED A LITTLE BOX FROM HER CORNER DRAWER AND WENT TO FIND MARTHA WHO WAS LAYING THE CLOTH AND NOT IN THE BEST OF TEMPERS
876-126411-0022 JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS UP TO SOME MISCHIEF SAID MARTHA DUMPING DOWN A SALT CELLAR WITH A BANG DON'T BE CROSS MARTHA DEAR SAID ANTHEA I'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR A NEW ONE
876-126411-0023 AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GET IT TO DAY IN CASE MOTHER COMES HOME TO MORROW YOU KNOW SHE SAID SHE MIGHT PERHAPS BUT YOU'RE ALL GOING INTO TOWN YOURSELVES SAID MARTHA
876-126411-0024 WE CAN'T AFFORD TO IF WE GET THE NEW JUG SAID ANTHEA BUT WE'LL PAY FOR YOU TO GO IF YOU'LL TAKE THE LAMB AND I SAY MARTHA LOOK HERE I'LL GIVE YOU MY LIBERTY BOX IF YOU'LL GO
876-126411-0025 LOOK IT'S MOST AWFULLY PRETTY ALL INLAID WITH REAL SILVER AND IVORY AND EBONY LIKE KING SOLOMON'S TEMPLE I SEE SAID MARTHA NO I DON'T WANT YOUR BOX MISS WHAT YOU WANT IS TO GET THE PRECIOUS LAMB OFF YOUR HANDS FOR THE AFTERNOON
876-126411-0026 DON'T YOU GO FOR TO THINK I DON'T SEE THROUGH YOU THIS WAS SO TRUE THAT ANTHEA LONGED TO DENY IT AT ONCE MARTHA HAD NO BUSINESS TO KNOW SO MUCH BUT SHE HELD HER TONGUE MARTHA SET DOWN THE BREAD WITH A BANG THAT MADE IT JUMP OFF ITS TRENCHER
876-126411-0027 I DO WANT THE JUG GOT SAID ANTHEA SOFTLY YOU WILL GO WON'T YOU WELL JUST FOR THIS ONCE I DON'T MIND BUT MIND YOU DON'T GET INTO NONE OF YOUR OUTRAGEOUS MISCHIEF WHILE I'M GONE THAT'S ALL
876-126411-0028 HE'S GOING EARLIER THAN HE THOUGHT SAID ANTHEA EAGERLY YOU'D BETTER HURRY AND GET DRESSED DO PUT ON THAT LOVELY PURPLE FROCK MARTHA AND THE HAT WITH THE PINK CORNFLOWERS AND THE YELLOW LACE COLLAR
876-126411-0029 JANE'LL FINISH LAYING THE CLOTH AND I'LL WASH THE LAMB AND GET HIM READY AS SHE WASHED THE UNWILLING LAMB AND HURRIED HIM INTO HIS BEST CLOTHES ANTHEA PEEPED OUT OF THE WINDOW FROM TIME TO TIME SO FAR ALL WAS WELL SHE COULD SEE NO RED INDIANS
876-126411-0030 HAD BEEN GOT OFF ANTHEA DREW A DEEP BREATH HE'S SAFE SHE SAID AND TO JANE'S HORROR
876-126411-0031 JANE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL HOW A PERSON COULD BE SO BRAVE AND LIKE A GENERAL AND THEN SUDDENLY GIVE WAY AND GO FLAT LIKE AN AIR BALLOON WHEN YOU PRICK IT
876-126411-0032 IT IS BETTER NOT TO GO FLAT OF COURSE BUT YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT ANTHEA DID NOT GIVE WAY TILL HER AIM WAS ACCOMPLISHED SHE HAD GOT THE DEAR LAMB OUT OF DANGER SHE FELT CERTAIN THE RED INDIANS WOULD BE ROUND THE WHITE HOUSE OR NOWHERE
876-126411-0033 THE FARMER'S CART WOULD NOT COME BACK TILL AFTER SUNSET SO SHE COULD AFFORD TO CRY A LITTLE IT WAS PARTLY WITH JOY THAT SHE CRIED BECAUSE SHE HAD DONE WHAT SHE MEANT TO DO SHE CRIED FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES
876-126411-0034 WHILE JANE HUGGED HER MISERABLY AND SAID AT FIVE SECOND INTERVALS DON'T CRY PANTHER DEAR THEN SHE JUMPED UP RUBBED HER EYES HARD WITH THE CORNER OF HER PINAFORE
876-126411-0035 SO THAT THEY KEPT RED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY AND STARTED TO TELL THE BOYS BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT COOK RANG THE DINNER BELL AND NOTHING COULD BE SAID TILL THEY HAD ALL BEEN HELPED TO MINCED BEEF THEN COOK LEFT THE ROOM AND ANTHEA TOLD HER TALE
876-126411-0036 THERE SEEMED SOMEHOW TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT THE FOOD THAT MADE THE IDEA OF RED INDIANS SEEM FLAT AND UNBELIEVABLE THE BOYS ACTUALLY LAUGHED AND CALLED ANTHEA A LITTLE SILLY WHY SAID CYRIL
876-126411-0037 IT WASN'T SAID JANE BRIEFLY WHY IF IT WAS INDIANS CYRIL WENT ON SALT PLEASE AND MUSTARD I MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS MUSH GO DOWN IF IT WAS INDIANS THEY'D HAVE BEEN INFESTING THE PLACE LONG BEFORE THIS YOU KNOW THEY WOULD
876-126411-0038 I BELIEVE IT'S THE FINE DAY THEN WHY DID THE SAMMYADD SAY WE'D LET OURSELVES IN FOR A NICE THING ASKED ANTHEA SHE WAS FEELING VERY CROSS SHE KNEW SHE HAD ACTED WITH NOBILITY AND DISCRETION
876-126411-0039 AND AFTER THAT IT WAS VERY HARD TO BE CALLED A LITTLE SILLY ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE HAD THE WEIGHT OF A BURGLARED MISSIONARY BOX AND ABOUT SEVEN AND FOURPENCE MOSTLY IN COPPERS LYING LIKE LEAD UPON HER CONSCIENCE
876-126411-0040 THERE WAS A SILENCE DURING WHICH COOK TOOK AWAY THE MINCY PLATES AND BROUGHT IN THE TREACLE PUDDING AS SOON AS SHE HAD RETIRED CYRIL BEGAN AGAIN OF COURSE I DON'T MEAN TO SAY HE ADMITTED THAT IT WASN'T A GOOD THING TO GET MARTHA AND THE LAMB OUT OF THE LIGHT FOR THE AFTERNOON
876-126411-0041 BUT AS FOR RED INDIANS WHY YOU KNOW JOLLY WELL THE WISHES ALWAYS COME THAT VERY MINUTE IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE RED INDIANS THEY'D BE HERE NOW I EXPECT THEY ARE SAID ANTHEA THEY'RE LURKING AMID THE UNDERGROWTH FOR ANYTHING YOU KNOW
876-126411-0042 I DO THINK YOU'RE MOST BEASTLY UNKIND INDIANS ALMOST ALWAYS DO LURK REALLY THOUGH DON'T THEY PUT IN JANE ANXIOUS FOR PEACE NO THEY DON'T SAID CYRIL TARTLY AND I'M NOT UNKIND I'M ONLY TRUTHFUL
876-126411-0043 AND I SAY IT WAS UTTER ROT BREAKING THE WATER JUG AND AS FOR THE MISSIONARY BOX I BELIEVE IT'S A TREASON CRIME AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU COULD BE HANGED FOR IT IF ANY OF US WAS TO SPLIT SHUT UP CAN'T YOU SAID ROBERT BUT CYRIL COULDN'T
876-126411-0044 YOU SEE HE FELT IN HIS HEART THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE INDIANS THEY WOULD BE ENTIRELY HIS OWN FAULT SO HE DID NOT WISH TO BELIEVE IN THEM AND TRYING NOT TO BELIEVE THINGS WHEN IN YOUR HEART YOU ARE ALMOST SURE THEY ARE TRUE IS AS BAD FOR THE TEMPER AS ANYTHING I KNOW
876-126411-0045 AND THE FACE WAS PAINTED IN COLOURED PATCHES IT HAD LONG BLACK HAIR AND IN THE HAIR WERE FEATHERS EVERY CHILD'S MOUTH IN THE ROOM OPENED AND STAYED OPEN THE TREACLE PUDDING WAS GROWING WHITE AND COLD ON THEIR PLATES
876-126411-0046 NO ONE COULD MOVE SUDDENLY THE FEATHERED HEAD WAS CAUTIOUSLY WITHDRAWN AND THE SPELL WAS BROKEN I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT ANTHEA'S FIRST WORDS WERE VERY LIKE A GIRL THERE NOW SHE SAID I TOLD YOU SO
876-126411-0047 TREACLE PUDDING HAD NOW DEFINITELY CEASED TO CHARM HASTILY WRAPPING THEIR PORTIONS IN A SPECTATOR OF THE WEEK BEFORE THE WEEK BEFORE LAST THEY HID THEM BEHIND THE CRINKLED PAPER STOVE ORNAMENT AND FLED UPSTAIRS TO RECONNOITRE
876-126411-0048 AND TO HOLD A HURRIED COUNCIL PAX SAID CYRIL HANDSOMELY WHEN THEY REACHED THEIR MOTHER'S BEDROOM PANTHER I'M SORRY IF I WAS A BRUTE ALL RIGHT SAID ANTHEA BUT YOU SEE NOW
876-126411-0049 NO FURTHER TRACE OF INDIANS HOWEVER COULD BE DISCERNED FROM THE WINDOWS WELL SAID ROBERT WHAT ARE WE TO DO THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF SAID ANTHEA WHO WAS NOW GENERALLY ADMITTED TO BE THE HEROINE OF THE DAY IS
876-126411-0050 IF WE DRESSED UP AS LIKE INDIANS AS WE CAN AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS OR EVEN WENT OUT THEY MIGHT THINK WE WERE THE POWERFUL LEADERS OF A LARGE NEIGHBOURING TRIBE AND AND NOT DO ANYTHING TO US YOU KNOW FOR FEAR OF AWFUL VENGEANCE BUT ELIZA
876-126411-0051 AND THE COOK SAID JANE YOU FORGET THEY CAN'T NOTICE ANYTHING SAID ROBERT THEY WOULDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING OUT OF THE WAY EVEN IF THEY WERE SCALPED OR ROASTED AT A SLOW FIRE BUT WOULD THEY COME RIGHT AT SUNSET OF COURSE
876-126411-0052 YOU CAN'T BE REALLY SCALPED OR BURNED TO DEATH WITHOUT NOTICING IT AND YOU'D BE SURE TO NOTICE IT NEXT DAY EVEN IF IT ESCAPED YOUR ATTENTION AT THE TIME SAID CYRIL I THINK ANTHEA'S RIGHT BUT WE SHALL WANT A MOST AWFUL LOT OF FEATHERS I'LL GO DOWN TO THE HEN HOUSE SAID ROBERT
876-126411-0053 THERE'S ONE OF THE TURKEYS IN THERE IT'S NOT VERY WELL I COULD CUT ITS FEATHERS WITHOUT IT MINDING MUCH IT'S VERY BAD DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO IT GET ME THE CUTTING OUT SCISSORS
876-126411-0054 EARNEST RECONNOITRING CONVINCED THEM ALL THAT NO INDIANS WERE IN THE POULTRY YARD ROBERT WENT IN FIVE MINUTES HE CAME BACK PALE BUT WITH MANY FEATHERS LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS JOLLY SERIOUS
876-126411-0055 I CUT OFF THE FEATHERS AND WHEN I TURNED TO COME OUT THERE WAS AN INDIAN SQUINTING AT ME FROM UNDER THE OLD HEN COOP I JUST BRANDISHED THE FEATHERS AND YELLED AND GOT AWAY BEFORE HE COULD GET THE COOP OFF THE TOP OF HIMSELF PANTHER
876-126411-0056 GET THE COLOURED BLANKETS OFF OUR BEDS AND LOOK SLIPPY CAN'T YOU IT IS WONDERFUL HOW LIKE AN INDIAN YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELVES WITH BLANKETS AND FEATHERS AND COLOURED SCARVES
876-126411-0057 BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF BLACK CALICO THAT HAD BEEN GOT TO COVER SCHOOL BOOKS WITH THEY CUT STRIPS OF THIS INTO A SORT OF FINE FRINGE AND FASTENED IT ROUND THEIR HEADS WITH THE AMBER COLOURED RIBBONS OFF THE GIRLS SUNDAY DRESSES
876-126411-0058 THEN THEY STUCK TURKEYS FEATHERS IN THE RIBBONS THE CALICO LOOKED VERY LIKE LONG BLACK HAIR ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STRIPS BEGAN TO CURL UP A BIT BUT OUR FACES SAID ANTHEA THEY'RE NOT AT ALL THE RIGHT COLOUR
876-126411-0059 WE'RE ALL RATHER PALE AND I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT CYRIL IS THE COLOUR OF PUTTY I'M NOT SAID CYRIL THE REAL INDIANS OUTSIDE SEEM TO BE BROWNISH SAID ROBERT HASTILY I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE REALLY RED
876-126411-0060 IT'S SORT OF SUPERIOR TO HAVE A RED SKIN IF YOU ARE ONE THE RED OCHRE COOK USED FOR THE KITCHEN BRICKS SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE REDDEST THING IN THE HOUSE THE CHILDREN MIXED SOME IN A SAUCER WITH MILK AS THEY HAD SEEN COOK DO FOR THE KITCHEN FLOOR
876-126411-0061 THEN THEY CAREFULLY PAINTED EACH OTHER'S FACES AND HANDS WITH IT TILL THEY WERE QUITE AS RED AS ANY RED INDIAN NEED BE IF NOT REDDER THEY KNEW AT ONCE THAT THEY MUST LOOK VERY TERRIBLE WHEN THEY MET ELIZA IN THE PASSAGE AND SHE SCREAMED ALOUD
876-126411-0062 THIS UNSOLICITED TESTIMONIAL PLEASED THEM VERY MUCH HASTILY TELLING HER NOT TO BE A GOOSE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY A GAME THE FOUR BLANKETED FEATHERED REALLY AND TRULY REDSKINS WENT BOLDLY OUT TO MEET THE FOE I SAY BOLDLY
876-126411-0063 AT ANY RATE THEY WENT ALONG THE HEDGE DIVIDING THE WILDERNESS FROM THE GARDEN WAS A ROW OF DARK HEADS ALL HIGHLY FEATHERED IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE WHISPERED ANTHEA
876-126411-0064 MUCH BETTER THAN TO WAIT FOR THEIR BLOOD FREEZING ATTACK WE MUST PRETEND LIKE MAD LIKE THAT GAME OF CARDS WHERE YOU PRETEND YOU'VE GOT ACES WHEN YOU HAVEN'T FLUFFING THEY CALL IT I THINK NOW THEN WHOOP
876-126411-0065 WITH FOUR WILD WAR WHOOPS OR AS NEAR THEM AS ENGLISH CHILDREN COULD BE EXPECTED TO GO WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS PRACTICE THEY RUSHED THROUGH THE GATE AND STRUCK FOUR WARLIKE ATTITUDES IN FACE OF THE LINE OF RED INDIANS
876-126411-0066 THESE WERE ALL ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT AND THAT HEIGHT WAS CYRIL'S I HOPE TO GOODNESS THEY CAN TALK ENGLISH SAID CYRIL THROUGH HIS ATTITUDE ANTHEA KNEW THEY COULD THOUGH SHE NEVER KNEW HOW SHE CAME TO KNOW IT
876-126411-0067 SHE HAD A WHITE TOWEL TIED TO A WALKING STICK THIS WAS A FLAG OF TRUCE AND SHE WAVED IT IN THE HOPE THAT THE INDIANS WOULD KNOW WHAT IT WAS APPARENTLY THEY DID FOR ONE WHO WAS BROWNER THAN THE OTHERS STEPPED FORWARD
876-126411-0068 YE SEEK A POW WOW HE SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH I AM GOLDEN EAGLE OF THE MIGHTY TRIBE OF ROCK DWELLERS AND I SAID ANTHEA WITH A SUDDEN INSPIRATION AM THE BLACK PANTHER
876-126411-0069 THE MAZAWATTEE TRIBE MY BROTHERS I DON'T MEAN YES I DO THE TRIBE I MEAN THE MAZAWATTEES ARE IN AMBUSH BELOW THE BROW OF YONDER HILL AND WHAT MIGHTY WARRIORS BE THESE ASKED GOLDEN EAGLE TURNING TO THE OTHERS
876-126411-0070 CYRIL SAID HE WAS THE GREAT CHIEF SQUIRREL OF THE MONING CONGO TRIBE AND SEEING THAT JANE WAS SUCKING HER THUMB AND COULD EVIDENTLY THINK OF NO NAME FOR HERSELF HE ADDED THIS GREAT WARRIOR IS WILD CAT
876-126411-0071 PUSSY FEROX WE CALL IT IN THIS LAND LEADER OF THE VAST PHITEEZI TRIBE AND THOU VALOROUS REDSKIN GOLDEN EAGLE INQUIRED SUDDENLY OF ROBERT WHO TAKEN UNAWARES COULD ONLY REPLY THAT HE WAS BOBS LEADER OF THE CAPE MOUNTED POLICE
876-126411-0072 AND NOW SAID BLACK PANTHER OUR TRIBES IF WE JUST WHISTLE THEM UP WILL FAR OUTNUMBER YOUR PUNY FORCES SO RESISTANCE IS USELESS RETURN THEREFORE TO YOUR OWN LAND O BROTHER
876-126411-0073 AND SMOKE PIPES OF PEACE IN YOUR WAMPUMS WITH YOUR SQUAWS AND YOUR MEDICINE MEN AND DRESS YOURSELVES IN THE GAYEST WIGWAMS AND EAT HAPPILY OF THE JUICY FRESH CAUGHT MOCCASINS YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG MURMURED CYRIL ANGRILY
876-126411-0074 BUT GOLDEN EAGLE ONLY LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT HER THY CUSTOMS ARE OTHER THAN OURS O BLACK PANTHER HE SAID BRING UP THY TRIBE THAT WE MAY HOLD POW WOW IN STATE BEFORE THEM AS BECOMES GREAT CHIEFS
876-126411-0075 WE'LL BRING THEM UP RIGHT ENOUGH SAID ANTHEA WITH THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS AND TOMAHAWKS AND SCALPING KNIVES AND EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF IF YOU DON'T LOOK SHARP AND GO SHE SPOKE BRAVELY ENOUGH
876-126411-0076 BUT THE HEARTS OF ALL THE CHILDREN WERE BEATING FURIOUSLY AND THEIR BREATH CAME IN SHORTER AND SHORTER GASPS FOR THE LITTLE REAL RED INDIANS WERE CLOSING UP ROUND THEM COMING NEARER AND NEARER WITH ANGRY MURMURS
876-126411-0077 SO THAT THEY WERE THE CENTRE OF A CROWD OF DARK CRUEL FACES IT'S NO GO WHISPERED ROBERT I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE WE MUST MAKE A BOLT FOR THE PSAMMEAD IT MIGHT HELP US IF IT DOESN'T WELL
876-126411-0078 I WONDER IF SCALPING HURTS AS MUCH AS THEY SAY I'LL WAVE THE FLAG AGAIN SAID ANTHEA IF THEY STAND BACK WE'LL RUN FOR IT SHE WAVED THE TOWEL AND THE CHIEF COMMANDED HIS FOLLOWERS TO STAND BACK
876-126411-0079 THE FOUR CHILDREN STARTED TO RUN THEIR FIRST RUSH KNOCKED DOWN SOME HALF DOZEN INDIANS OVER WHOSE BLANKETED BODIES THE CHILDREN LEAPED AND MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE SAND PIT THIS WAS NO TIME FOR THE SAFE EASY WAY BY WHICH CARTS GO DOWN
876-126411-0080 RIGHT OVER THE EDGE OF THE SAND PIT THEY WENT AMONG THE YELLOW AND PALE PURPLE FLOWERS AND DRIED GRASSES PAST THE LITTLE SAND MARTINS LITTLE FRONT DOORS SKIPPING CLINGING BOUNDING STUMBLING SPRAWLING AND FINALLY ROLLING
876-126411-0081 YELLOW EAGLE AND HIS FOLLOWERS CAME UP WITH THEM JUST AT THE VERY SPOT WHERE THEY HAD SEEN THE PSAMMEAD THAT MORNING BREATHLESS AND BEATEN THE WRETCHED CHILDREN NOW AWAITED THEIR FATE
876-126411-0082 SHARP KNIVES AND AXES GLEAMED ROUND THEM BUT WORSE THAN THESE WAS THE CRUEL LIGHT IN THE EYES OF GOLDEN EAGLE AND HIS FOLLOWERS YE HAVE LIED TO US O BLACK PANTHER OF THE MAZAWATTEES AND THOU TOO SQUIRREL OF THE MONING CONGOS
876-126411-0083 THESE ALSO PUSSY FEROX OF THE PHITEEZI AND BOBS OF THE CAPE MOUNTED POLICE THESE ALSO HAVE LIED TO US IF NOT WITH THEIR TONGUE YET BY THEIR SILENCE
876-126411-0084 YE HAVE LIED UNDER THE COVER OF THE TRUCE FLAG OF THE PALE FACE YE HAVE NO FOLLOWERS YOUR TRIBES ARE FAR AWAY FOLLOWING THE HUNTING TRAIL WHAT SHALL BE THEIR DOOM HE CONCLUDED
876-126411-0085 TURNING WITH A BITTER SMILE TO THE OTHER RED INDIANS BUILD WE THE FIRE SHOUTED HIS FOLLOWERS AND AT ONCE A DOZEN READY VOLUNTEERS STARTED TO LOOK FOR FUEL
876-126411-0086 THE FOUR CHILDREN EACH HELD BETWEEN TWO STRONG LITTLE INDIANS CAST DESPAIRING GLANCES ROUND THEM OH IF THEY COULD ONLY SEE THE PSAMMEAD DO YOU MEAN TO SCALP US FIRST AND THEN ROAST US ASKED ANTHEA DESPERATELY
876-126411-0087 THE INDIANS HAD FORMED A RING ROUND THE CHILDREN AND NOW SAT ON THE GROUND GAZING AT THEIR CAPTIVES THERE WAS A THREATENING SILENCE THEN SLOWLY BY TWOS AND THREES THE INDIANS WHO HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR FIREWOOD CAME BACK AND THEY CAME BACK EMPTY HANDED
876-126411-0088 NO ONE EVER CAN AS A MATTER OF FACT IN THAT PART OF KENT THE CHILDREN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF BUT IT ENDED IN A MOAN OF TERROR FOR BRIGHT KNIVES WERE BEING BRANDISHED ALL ABOUT THEM NEXT MOMENT EACH CHILD WAS SEIZED BY AN INDIAN
876-126411-0089 EACH CLOSED ITS EYES AND TRIED NOT TO SCREAM THEY WAITED FOR THE SHARP AGONY OF THE KNIFE IT DID NOT COME NEXT MOMENT THEY WERE RELEASED AND FELL IN A TREMBLING HEAP THEIR HEADS DID NOT HURT AT ALL
876-126411-0090 THEY ONLY FELT STRANGELY COOL WILD WAR WHOOPS RANG IN THEIR EARS WHEN THEY VENTURED TO OPEN THEIR EYES THEY SAW FOUR OF THEIR FOES DANCING ROUND THEM WITH WILD LEAPS AND SCREAMS AND EACH OF THE FOUR
876-126411-0091 BRANDISHED IN HIS HAND A SCALP OF LONG FLOWING BLACK HAIR THEY PUT THEIR HANDS TO THEIR HEADS THEIR OWN SCALPS WERE SAFE THE POOR UNTUTORED SAVAGES HAD INDEED SCALPED THE CHILDREN
