464-126832-0000 FELICITY WAS CUMBERED WITH MANY CARES THE NEXT MORNING FOR ONE THING THE WHOLE HOUSE MUST BE PUT IN APPLE PIE ORDER AND FOR ANOTHER AN ELABORATE SUPPER MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN OF THE TRAVELLERS THAT NIGHT FELICITY DEVOTED HER WHOLE ATTENTION TO THIS
464-126832-0001 AND LEFT THE SECONDARY PREPARATION OF THE REGULAR MEALS TO CECILY AND THE STORY GIRL IT WAS AGREED THAT THE LATTER WAS TO MAKE A CORNMEAL PUDDING FOR DINNER IN SPITE OF HER DISASTER WITH THE BREAD
464-126832-0002 THE STORY GIRL HAD BEEN TAKING COOKING LESSONS FROM FELICITY ALL THE WEEK AND GETTING ON TOLERABLY WELL ALTHOUGH MINDFUL OF HER FORMER MISTAKE SHE NEVER VENTURED ON ANYTHING WITHOUT FELICITY'S APPROVAL BUT FELICITY HAD NO TIME TO OVERSEE HER THIS MORNING
464-126832-0003 YOU MUST ATTEND TO THE PUDDING YOURSELF SHE SAID THE RECIPE'S SO PLAIN AND SIMPLE EVEN YOU CAN'T GO ASTRAY AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU CAN ASK ME BUT DON'T BOTHER ME IF YOU CAN HELP IT
464-126832-0004 AS THE STORY GIRL PROUDLY INFORMED US WHEN WE CAME TO THE DINNER TABLE ALL ON HER OWN HOOK SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF IT AND CERTAINLY AS FAR AS APPEARANCE WENT IT JUSTIFIED HER TRIUMPH THE SLICES WERE SMOOTH AND GOLDEN
464-126832-0005 WERE VERY FAIR TO VIEW NEVERTHELESS ALTHOUGH NONE OF US NOT EVEN UNCLE ROGER OR FELICITY SAID A WORD AT THE TIME FOR FEAR OF HURTING THE STORY GIRL'S FEELINGS THE PUDDING DID NOT TASTE EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD IT WAS TOUGH DECIDEDLY TOUGH
464-126832-0006 AND LACKED THE RICHNESS OF FLAVOUR WHICH WAS CUSTOMARY IN AUNT JANET'S CORNMEAL PUDDINGS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF SAUCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DRY EATING INDEED EATEN IT WAS HOWEVER TO THE LAST CRUMB
464-126832-0007 IF IT WERE NOT JUST WHAT A CORNMEAL PUDDING MIGHT BE THE REST OF THE BILL OF FARE HAD BEEN EXTRA GOOD AND OUR APPETITES MATCHED IT I WISH I WAS TWINS SO'S I COULD EAT MORE SAID DAN WHEN HE SIMPLY HAD TO STOP
464-126832-0008 WHAT GOOD WOULD BEING TWINS DO YOU ASKED PETER PEOPLE WHO SQUINT CAN'T EAT ANY MORE THAN PEOPLE WHO DON'T SQUINT CAN THEY WE COULD NOT SEE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN PETER'S TWO QUESTIONS WHAT HAS SQUINTING GOT TO DO WITH TWINS ASKED DAN
464-126832-0009 WHY TWINS ARE JUST PEOPLE THAT SQUINT AREN'T THEY SAID PETER WE THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO BE FUNNY UNTIL WE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST THEN WE LAUGHED UNTIL PETER GOT SULKY I DON'T CARE HE SAID HOW'S A FELLOW TO KNOW
464-126832-0010 TOMMY AND ADAM COWAN OVER AT MARKDALE ARE TWINS AND THEY'RE BOTH CROSS EYED SO I S'POSED THAT WAS WHAT BEING TWINS MEANT IT'S ALL VERY FINE FOR YOU FELLOWS TO LAUGH I NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL HALF AS MUCH AS YOU DID AND YOU WAS BROUGHT UP IN TORONTO TOO
464-126832-0011 IF YOU'D WORKED OUT EVER SINCE YOU WAS SEVEN AND JUST GOT TO SCHOOL IN THE WINTER THERE'D BE LOTS OF THINGS YOU WOULDN'T KNOW EITHER
464-126832-0012 YOU KNOW LOTS OF THINGS THEY DON'T BUT PETER WAS NOT TO BE CONCILIATED AND TOOK HIMSELF OFF IN HIGH DUDGEON TO BE LAUGHED AT BEFORE FELICITY TO BE LAUGHED AT BY FELICITY WAS SOMETHING HE COULD NOT ENDURE LET CECILY AND THE STORY GIRL CACKLE ALL THEY WANTED TO
464-126832-0013 AND LET THOSE STUCK UP TORONTO BOYS GRIN LIKE CHESSY CATS BUT WHEN FELICITY LAUGHED AT HIM THE IRON ENTERED INTO PETER'S SOUL IF THE STORY GIRL LAUGHED AT PETER THE MILLS OF THE GODS GROUND OUT HIS REVENGE FOR HIM IN MID AFTERNOON
464-126832-0014 FELICITY HAVING USED UP ALL THE AVAILABLE COOKING MATERIALS IN THE HOUSE HAD TO STOP PERFORCE AND SHE NOW DETERMINED TO STUFF TWO NEW PINCUSHIONS SHE HAD BEEN MAKING FOR HER ROOM
464-126832-0015 WE HEARD HER RUMMAGING IN THE PANTRY AS WE SAT ON THE COOL SPRUCE SHADOWED CELLAR DOOR OUTSIDE WHERE UNCLE ROGER WAS SHOWING US HOW TO MAKE ELDERBERRY POP GUNS PRESENTLY SHE CAME OUT FROWNING CECILY
464-126832-0016 DO YOU KNOW WHERE MOTHER PUT THE SAWDUST SHE EMPTIED OUT OF THAT OLD BEADED PINCUSHION OF GRANDMOTHER KING'S AFTER SHE HAD SIFTED THE NEEDLES OUT OF IT I THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE TIN BOX SO IT IS SAID CECILY IT ISN'T THERE ISN'T A SPECK OF SAWDUST IN THAT BOX
464-126832-0017 THE STORY GIRL'S FACE WORE A QUITE INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION COMPOUND OF HORROR AND SHAME SHE NEED NOT HAVE CONFESSED IF SHE HAD BUT HELD HER TONGUE THE MYSTERY OF THE SAWDUST'S DISAPPEARANCE MIGHT HAVE FOREVER REMAINED A MYSTERY SHE WOULD HAVE HELD HER TONGUE
464-126832-0018 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A HORRIBLE FEAR WHICH FLASHED INTO HER MIND THAT POSSIBLY SAWDUST PUDDINGS WERE NOT HEALTHY FOR PEOPLE TO EAT
464-126832-0019 DIRECTION IT WAS HER DUTY TO UNDO IT IF POSSIBLE AT ANY COST OF RIDICULE TO HERSELF OH FELICITY SHE SAID HER VOICE EXPRESSING A VERY ANGUISH OF HUMILIATION I
464-126832-0020 FELICITY AND CECILY STARED BLANKLY AT THE STORY GIRL WE BOYS BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT WERE CHECKED MIDWAY BY UNCLE ROGER HE WAS ROCKING HIMSELF BACK AND FORTH WITH HIS HAND PRESSED AGAINST HIS STOMACH OH HE GROANED
464-126832-0021 I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT THESE SHARP PAINS I'VE BEEN FEELING EVER SINCE DINNER MEANT I KNOW NOW I MUST HAVE SWALLOWED A NEEDLE SEVERAL NEEDLES PERHAPS I'M DONE FOR
464-126832-0022 THE POOR STORY GIRL WENT VERY WHITE OH UNCLE ROGER COULD IT BE POSSIBLE YOU COULDN'T HAVE SWALLOWED A NEEDLE WITHOUT KNOWING IT IT WOULD HAVE STUCK IN YOUR TONGUE OR TEETH I DIDN'T CHEW THE PUDDING GROANED UNCLE ROGER IT WAS TOO TOUGH I JUST SWALLOWED THE CHUNKS WHOLE
464-126832-0023 HE GROANED AND TWISTED AND DOUBLED HIMSELF UP BUT HE OVERDID IT HE WAS NOT AS GOOD AN ACTOR AS THE STORY GIRL FELICITY LOOKED SCORNFULLY AT HIM UNCLE ROGER YOU ARE NOT ONE BIT SICK SHE SAID DELIBERATELY YOU ARE JUST PUTTING ON
464-126832-0024 FELICITY IF I DIE FROM THE EFFECTS OF EATING SAWDUST PUDDING FLAVOURED WITH NEEDLES YOU'LL BE SORRY YOU EVER SAID SUCH A THING TO YOUR POOR OLD UNCLE SAID UNCLE ROGER REPROACHFULLY EVEN IF THERE WERE NO NEEDLES IN IT

464-126832-0028 I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WERE ANY NEEDLES IN THAT SAWDUST MOTHER SIFTED IT VERY CAREFULLY I KNOW A STORY ABOUT A MAN WHOSE SON SWALLOWED A MOUSE SAID THE STORY GIRL WHO WOULD PROBABLY HAVE KNOWN A STORY AND TRIED TO TELL IT
464-126832-0029 IF SHE WERE BEING LED TO THE STAKE AND HE RAN AND WAKENED UP A VERY TIRED DOCTOR JUST AS HE HAD GOT TO SLEEP OH DOCTOR MY SON HAS SWALLOWED A MOUSE HE CRIED WHAT SHALL I DO
464-126832-0030 TELL HIM TO SWALLOW A CAT ROARED THE POOR DOCTOR AND SLAMMED HIS DOOR NOW IF UNCLE ROGER HAS SWALLOWED ANY NEEDLES MAYBE IT WOULD MAKE IT ALL RIGHT IF HE SWALLOWED A PINCUSHION
464-126832-0031 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE IT LOOKED JUST LIKE CORNMEAL SAID THE STORY GIRL GOING FROM WHITE TO RED IN HER SHAME WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE UP TRYING TO COOK AND STICK TO THINGS I CAN DO
464-126832-0032 AND IF EVER ONE OF YOU MENTIONS SAWDUST PUDDING TO ME I'LL NEVER TELL YOU ANOTHER STORY AS LONG AS I LIVE THE THREAT WAS EFFECTUAL NEVER DID WE MENTION THAT UNHOLY PUDDING
464-126832-0033 HE TORMENTED HER FOR THE REST OF THE SUMMER NEVER A BREAKFAST DID HE SIT DOWN TO WITHOUT GRAVELY INQUIRING IF THEY WERE SURE THERE WAS NO SAWDUST IN THE PORRIDGE
