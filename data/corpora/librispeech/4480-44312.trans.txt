4480-44312-0000 SECOND SCENE VANGE ABBEY
4480-44312-0001 HIS HEAD DROOPED HIS EYES HALF CLOSED HE LOOKED LIKE A WEARY MAN QUIETLY FALLING ASLEEP ON LEAVING THE STEAMBOAT I VENTURED TO ASK OUR CHARMING FELLOW PASSENGER IF I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE IN RESERVING PLACES IN THE LONDON TRAIN
4480-44312-0002 FOR HER MOTHER AND HERSELF SHE THANKED ME AND SAID THEY WERE GOING TO VISIT SOME FRIENDS AT FOLKESTONE IN MAKING THIS REPLY SHE LOOKED AT ROMAYNE I AM AFRAID HE IS VERY ILL SHE SAID IN GENTLY LOWERED TONES
4480-44312-0003 HE NEVER RETURNED IT HE WAS NOT EVEN AWARE OF IT AS I LED HIM TO THE TRAIN HE LEANED MORE AND MORE HEAVILY ON MY ARM SEATED IN THE CARRIAGE HE SANK AT ONCE INTO PROFOUND SLEEP
4480-44312-0004 HE SAID IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR ALONE FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T LEAVE ME I HAD RECEIVED LETTERS AT BOULOGNE WHICH INFORMED ME THAT MY WIFE AND FAMILY HAD ACCEPTED AN INVITATION TO STAY WITH SOME FRIENDS AT THE SEA SIDE
4480-44312-0005 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS ENTIRELY AT HIS SERVICE HAVING QUIETED HIS ANXIETY ON THIS POINT I REMINDED HIM OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN US ON BOARD THE STEAMBOAT HE TRIED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT MY CURIOSITY WAS TOO STRONGLY AROUSED TO PERMIT THIS
4480-44312-0006 THE STAIN OF ANOTHER MAN'S BLOOD IS ON ME I INTERRUPTED HIM IN MY TURN I REFUSE TO HEAR YOU SPEAK OF YOURSELF IN THAT WAY I SAID
4480-44312-0007 THE PROPER PERSON TO BE WITH YOU IS A DOCTOR I REALLY FELT IRRITATED WITH HIM AND I SAW NO REASON FOR CONCEALING IT ANOTHER MAN IN HIS PLACE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OFFENDED WITH ME
4480-44312-0008 THERE WAS A NATIVE SWEETNESS IN ROMAYNE'S DISPOSITION WHICH ASSERTED ITSELF EVEN IN HIS WORST MOMENTS OF NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE TOOK MY HAND DON'T BE HARD ON ME HE PLEADED I WILL TRY TO THINK OF IT AS YOU DO
4480-44312-0009 IS IT AGREED IT WAS AGREED OF COURSE THERE WAS A DOOR OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR BEDROOMS AT HIS SUGGESTION IT WAS LEFT OPEN
4480-44312-0010 THREE TIMES IN THE NIGHT I WOKE AND SEEING THE LIGHT BURNING IN HIS ROOM LOOKED IN AT HIM HE ALWAYS CARRIED SOME OF HIS BOOKS WITH HIM WHEN HE TRAVELED
4480-44312-0011 I SUPPOSE I FORESTALLED MY NIGHT'S SLEEP ON THE RAILWAY HE SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER I AM CONTENT
4480-44312-0012 I AM USED TO WAKEFUL NIGHTS GO BACK TO BED AND DON'T BE UNEASY ABOUT ME THE NEXT MORNING THE DEFERRED EXPLANATION WAS PUT OFF AGAIN
4480-44312-0013 HE ASKED NOT IF YOU PARTICULARLY WISH IT WILL YOU DO ME ANOTHER FAVOR YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T LIKE LONDON THE NOISE IN THE STREETS IS DISTRACTING BESIDES I MAY TELL YOU I HAVE A SORT OF DISTRUST OF NOISE SINCE HE STOPPED WITH AN APPEARANCE OF CONFUSION
4480-44312-0014 DULL AS THE PLACE IS YOU CAN AMUSE YOURSELF THERE IS GOOD SHOOTING AS YOU KNOW
4480-44312-0015 THE RUINS OF THE OLD MONASTERY ARE VISIBLE FROM ALL POINTS OF THE COMPASS THERE ARE TRADITIONS OF THRIVING VILLAGES CLUSTERING ABOUT THE ABBEY IN THE DAYS OF THE MONKS AND OF HOSTLERIES DEVOTED TO THE RECEPTION OF PILGRIMS FROM EVERY PART OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
4480-44312-0016 NOT A VESTIGE OF THESE BUILDINGS IS LEFT
4480-44312-0017 TO HIS FAITHFUL FRIEND AND COURTIER SIR MILES ROMAYNE IN THE NEXT GENERATION THE SON AND HEIR OF SIR MILES BUILT THE DWELLING HOUSE HELPING HIMSELF LIBERALLY FROM THE SOLID STONE WALLS OF THE MONASTERY WITH SOME UNIMPORTANT ALTERATIONS AND REPAIRS
4480-44312-0018 THE HOUSE STANDS DEFYING TIME AND WEATHER TO THE PRESENT DAY
4480-44312-0019 BETWEEN NINE AND TEN O'CLOCK WE REACHED THE ABBEY YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE I HAD LAST BEEN ROMAYNE'S GUEST NOTHING OUT OF THE HOUSE OR IN THE HOUSE SEEMED TO HAVE UNDERGONE ANY CHANGE IN THE INTERVAL
4480-44312-0020 I BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE FAMILIAR INFLUENCES OF HIS COUNTRY HOME WERE BEGINNING ALREADY TO BREATHE
4480-44312-0021 OVER THE DISTURBED MIND OF ROMAYNE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS FAITHFUL OLD SERVANTS HE SEEMED TO BE CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE MORBID REMORSE THAT OPPRESSED HIM HE SPOKE TO THEM COMPOSEDLY AND KINDLY
4480-44312-0022 WHEN HE SUDDENLY TURNED PALE AND LIFTED HIS HEAD LIKE A MAN WHOSE ATTENTION IS UNEXPECTEDLY ROUSED
4480-44312-0023 HE RECONSIDERED THAT BRIEF ANSWER AND CONTRADICTED HIMSELF YES THE LIBRARY FIRE HAS BURNED LOW I SUPPOSE IN MY POSITION AT THE TABLE I HAD SEEN THE FIRE THE GRATE WAS HEAPED WITH BLAZING COALS AND WOOD I SAID NOTHING
4480-44312-0024 HIS ATTITUDE AND EXPRESSION WERE PLAINLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE ACT OF LISTENING LISTENING TO WHAT AFTER AN INTERVAL HE ABRUPTLY ADDRESSED ME
4480-44312-0025 AND LEFT THE ROOM I HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO DO
4480-44312-0026 THE HOUSE EXTENDING ROUND THREE SIDES OF A SQUARE WAS ONLY TWO STORIES HIGH THE FLAT ROOF ACCESSIBLE THROUGH A SPECIES OF HATCHWAY AND STILL SURROUNDED BY ITS STURDY STONE PARAPET WAS CALLED THE BELVIDERE IN REFERENCE AS USUAL TO THE FINE VIEW WHICH IT COMMANDED
4480-44312-0027 FEARING I KNEW NOT WHAT I MOUNTED THE LADDER WHICH LED TO THE ROOF ROMAYNE RECEIVED ME WITH A HARSH OUTBURST OF LAUGHTER THAT SADDEST FALSE LAUGHTER WHICH IS TRUE TROUBLE IN DISGUISE HERE'S SOMETHING TO AMUSE YOU HE CRIED
4480-44312-0028 HE WON'T LEAVE ME UP HERE BY MYSELF LETTING THIS STRANGE ASSERTION REMAIN UNANSWERED THE BUTLER WITHDREW
4480-44312-0029 BE CAREFUL OF THE MASTER I TELL YOU SIR HE HAS A BEE IN HIS BONNET THIS NIGHT ALTHOUGH NOT OF THE NORTH COUNTRY MYSELF I KNEW THE MEANING OF THE PHRASE
4480-44312-0030 THE MOON WAS BY THIS TIME LOW IN THE HEAVENS BUT HER MILD MYSTERIOUS LIGHT STILL STREAMED OVER THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND THE HIGH HEATHY GROUND ROUND IT I LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT ROMAYNE HE WAS DEADLY PALE
4480-44312-0031 HIS HAND SHOOK AS IT RESTED ON MY ARM AND THAT WAS ALL NEITHER IN LOOK NOR MANNER DID HE BETRAY THE FAINTEST SIGN OF MENTAL DERANGEMENT HE HAD PERHAPS NEEDLESSLY ALARMED THE FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT BY SOMETHING THAT HE HAD SAID OR DONE
4480-44312-0032 I DETERMINED TO CLEAR UP THAT DOUBT IMMEDIATELY YOU LEFT THE TABLE VERY SUDDENLY I SAID DID YOU FEEL ILL NOT ILL HE REPLIED I WAS FRIGHTENED LOOK AT ME I'M FRIGHTENED STILL WHAT DO YOU MEAN
4480-44312-0033 INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HE REPEATED THE STRANGE QUESTION WHICH HE HAD PUT TO ME DOWNSTAIRS DO YOU CALL IT A QUIET NIGHT CONSIDERING THE TIME OF YEAR AND THE EXPOSED SITUATION OF THE HOUSE THE NIGHT WAS ALMOST PRETERNATURALLY QUIET
4480-44312-0034 THROUGHOUT THE VAST OPEN COUNTRY ALL ROUND US NOT EVEN A BREATH OF AIR COULD BE HEARD THE NIGHT BIRDS WERE AWAY OR WERE SILENT AT THE TIME BUT ONE SOUND WAS AUDIBLE WHEN WE STOOD STILL AND LISTENED THE COOL QUIET BUBBLE OF A LITTLE STREAM
4480-44312-0035 LOST TO VIEW IN THE VALLEY GROUND TO THE SOUTH I HAVE TOLD YOU ALREADY I SAID SO STILL A NIGHT I NEVER REMEMBER ON THIS YORKSHIRE MOOR HE LAID ONE HAND HEAVILY ON MY SHOULDER
4480-44312-0036 I WON'T ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK OF THEM I REFUSE TO REPEAT THE WORDS HE POINTED OVER THE NORTHWARD PARAPET
4480-44312-0037 I HEAR THE BOY AS PLAINLY AS YOU HEAR ME THE VOICE SCREAMS AT ME THROUGH THE CLEAR MOONLIGHT AS IT SCREAMED AT ME THROUGH THE SEA FOG AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S ALL ROUND THE HOUSE THAT WAY NOW WHERE THE LIGHT JUST TOUCHES ON THE TOPS OF THE HEATHER
4480-44312-0038 TELL THE SERVANTS TO HAVE THE HORSES READY THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WE LEAVE VANGE ABBEY TO MORROW THESE WERE WILD WORDS IF HE HAD SPOKEN THEM WILDLY I MIGHT HAVE SHARED THE BUTLER'S CONCLUSION THAT HIS MIND WAS DERANGED
4480-44312-0039 HE SEEMED LIKE A PRISONER SUBMITTING TO A SENTENCE THAT HE HAD DESERVED REMEMBERING THE CASES OF MEN SUFFERING FROM NERVOUS DISEASE WHO HAD BEEN HAUNTED BY APPARITIONS I ASKED IF HE SAW ANY IMAGINARY FIGURE UNDER THE FORM OF A BOY I SEE NOTHING HE SAID
4480-44312-0040 ON ITS EASTWARD SIDE THE HOUSE WALL WAS BUILT AGAINST ONE OF THE TOWERS OF THE OLD ABBEY ON THE WESTWARD SIDE THE GROUND SLOPED STEEPLY DOWN TO A DEEP POOL OR TARN
4480-44312-0041 THE SOLITUDE WAS AS VOID OF ANY LIVING CREATURE AS IF WE HAD BEEN SURROUNDED BY THE AWFUL DEAD WORLD OF THE MOON WAS IT THE BOY'S VOICE THAT YOU HEARD ON THE VOYAGE ACROSS THE CHANNEL I ASKED YES I HEARD IT FOR THE FIRST TIME
4480-44312-0042 I WAS AFRAID THAT THE NOISE OF THE TRAFFIC IN THE STREETS MIGHT BRING IT BACK TO ME AS YOU KNOW I PASSED A QUIET NIGHT I HAD THE HOPE THAT MY IMAGINATION HAD DECEIVED ME THAT I WAS THE VICTIM OF A DELUSION AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS NO DELUSION
4480-44312-0043 IN THE PERFECT TRANQUILLITY OF THIS PLACE THE VOICE HAS COME BACK TO ME WHILE WE WERE AT TABLE I HEARD IT AGAIN BEHIND ME IN THE LIBRARY I HEARD IT STILL WHEN THE DOOR WAS SHUT I RAN UP HERE TO TRY IF IT WOULD FOLLOW ME INTO THE OPEN AIR IT HAS FOLLOWED ME
4480-44312-0044 WHAT I FELT AND FEARED IN THIS MISERABLE STATE OF THINGS MATTERS LITTLE THE ONE CHANCE I COULD SEE FOR ROMAYNE WAS TO OBTAIN THE BEST MEDICAL ADVICE
4480-44312-0045 DO YOU HEAR IT CONTINUOUSLY NO AT INTERVALS SOMETIMES LONGER SOMETIMES SHORTER
4480-44312-0046 YES DO MY QUESTIONS ANNOY YOU I MAKE NO COMPLAINT HE SAID SADLY YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF I PATIENTLY SUFFER THE PUNISHMENT THAT I HAVE DESERVED I CONTRADICTED HIM AT ONCE
4480-44312-0047 IT IS NOTHING OF THE SORT IT'S A NERVOUS MALADY WHICH MEDICAL SCIENCE CAN CONTROL AND CURE
4480-44312-0048 THIS EXPRESSION OF OPINION PRODUCED NO EFFECT ON HIM
4480-44312-0049 I HAVE CLOSED THE CAREER OF A YOUNG MAN WHO BUT FOR ME MIGHT HAVE LIVED LONG AND HAPPILY AND HONORABLY
4480-44312-0050 I AM OF THE RACE OF CAIN HE HAD THE MARK SET ON HIS BROW I HAVE MY ORDEAL DELUDE YOURSELF IF YOU LIKE WITH FALSE HOPES I CAN ENDURE AND HOPE FOR NOTHING
4480-44312-0051 DO COME SIR AND LOOK AT THE MASTER
4480-44312-0052 HE SLEPT UNTIL NOON THERE WAS NO RETURN OF THE TORMENT OF THE VOICE AS HE CALLED IT POOR FELLOW
4480-44312-0053 WE HAD RETURNED FROM A RIDE ROMAYNE HAD GONE INTO THE LIBRARY TO READ
4480-44312-0054 AS WELL AS MANY INTERESTING RELICS OF ANTIQUITY AND THE ROOMS WERE SHOWN IN ROMAYNE'S ABSENCE TO THE VERY FEW TRAVELERS
4480-44312-0055 MISTER ROMAYNE IS NOT VERY WELL I SAID AND I CANNOT VENTURE TO ASK YOU INTO THE HOUSE
4480-44312-0056 AND TO LOOK AT THE RUINS OF THE ABBEY HE THANKED ME AND ACCEPTED THE INVITATION I FIND NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING HIM GENERALLY HE WAS ELDERLY FAT AND CHEERFUL BUTTONED UP IN A LONG BLACK FROCKCOAT AND PRESENTING THAT CLOSELY SHAVEN FACE AND THAT
4480-44312-0057 WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED AND STOOD LOOKING AT IT WITH AN INTEREST WHICH WAS SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME THAT I OWN I WATCHED HIM HE ASCENDED THE SLOPE OF THE MOORLAND AND ENTERED THE GATE WHICH LED TO THE GROUNDS ALL THAT THE GARDENERS HAD DONE TO MAKE THE PLACE ATTRACTIVE
4480-44312-0058 FAILED TO CLAIM HIS ATTENTION HE WALKED PAST LAWNS SHRUBS AND FLOWER BEDS AND ONLY STOPPED AT AN OLD STONE FOUNTAIN WHICH TRADITION DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE ORNAMENTS OF THE GARDEN IN THE TIME OF THE MONKS HAVING CAREFULLY EXAMINED THIS RELIC OF ANTIQUITY
4480-44312-0059 HE TOOK A SHEET OF PAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND CONSULTED IT ATTENTIVELY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PLAN OF THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS OR IT MIGHT NOT I CAN ONLY REPORT THAT HE TOOK THE PATH WHICH LED HIM BY THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE RUINED ABBEY CHURCH
4480-44312-0060 AS HE ENTERED THE ROOFLESS INCLOSURE HE REVERENTLY REMOVED HIS HAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO FOLLOW HIM ANY FURTHER WITHOUT EXPOSING MYSELF TO THE RISK OF DISCOVERY I SAT DOWN ON ONE OF THE FALLEN STONES WAITING TO SEE HIM AGAIN
4480-44312-0061 IN THE POSSESSION OF THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE HE IS A YOUNG MAN I THINK YES IS HE MARRIED NO EXCUSE MY CURIOSITY THE OWNER OF VANGE ABBEY IS AN INTERESTING PERSON TO ALL GOOD ANTIQUARIES LIKE MYSELF
4480-44312-0062 MANY THANKS AGAIN GOOD DAY HIS PONY CHAISE TOOK HIM AWAY HIS LAST LOOK RESTED NOT ON ME
4480-44312-0063 THE BOULOGNE POSTMARK WAS ON ONE OF THE ENVELOPES AT ROMAYNE'S ENTREATY THIS WAS THE LETTER THAT I OPENED FIRST THE SURGEON'S SIGNATURE WAS AT THE END ONE MOTIVE FOR ANXIETY ON MY PART WAS SET AT REST IN THE FIRST LINES
4480-44312-0064 NO JURY HEARING THE EVIDENCE WOULD FIND HIM GUILTY OF THE ONLY CHARGE THAT COULD BE FORMALLY BROUGHT AGAINST HIM THE CHARGE OF HOMICIDE BY PREMEDITATION HOMICIDE BY MISADVENTURE OCCURRING IN A DUEL WAS NOT A PUNISHABLE OFFENSE BY THE FRENCH LAW
4480-44312-0065 MY CORRESPONDENT CITED MANY CASES IN PROOF OF IT STRENGTHENED BY THE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED OPINION OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS BERRYER HIMSELF IN A WORD WE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR
4480-44312-0066 IT WAS SUSPECTED IN THE TOWN THAT THE GENERAL WAS MORE OR LESS DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH CERTAIN DISREPUTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DISCOVERED BY THE AUTHORITIES
4480-44312-0067 HE AND HIS WIFE AND FAMILY HAD LEFT BOULOGNE
4480-44312-0068 NO INVESTIGATION HAD THUS FAR SUCCEEDED IN DISCOVERING THE PLACE OF THEIR RETREAT READING THIS LETTER ALOUD TO ROMAYNE I WAS INTERRUPTED BY HIM AT THE LAST SENTENCE
4480-44312-0069 I WILL SEE TO IT MYSELF WHAT INTEREST CAN YOU HAVE IN THE INQUIRIES I EXCLAIMED THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE INTEREST HE ANSWERED IT HAS BEEN MY ONE HOPE TO MAKE SOME LITTLE ATONEMENT TO THE POOR PEOPLE WHOM I HAVE SO CRUELLY WRONGED
4480-44312-0070 MERELY ANNOUNCING THAT AN UNKNOWN FRIEND DESIRES TO BE OF SERVICE TO THE GENERAL'S FAMILY THIS APPEARED TO ME TO BE A MOST IMPRUDENT THING TO DO I SAID SO PLAINLY AND QUITE IN VAIN
4480-44312-0071 ROMAYNE WAS DISPOSED TO BE EQUALLY UNREASONABLE BUT IN THIS CASE EVENTS DECLARED THEMSELVES IN MY FAVOR LADY BERRICK'S LAST RESERVES OF STRENGTH HAD GIVEN WAY
4480-44312-0072 ROMAYNE WAS SUMMONED TO HIS AUNT'S BEDSIDE ON THE THIRD DAY OF OUR RESIDENCE AT THE HOTEL AND WAS PRESENT AT HER DEATH
4480-44312-0073 AS I HAVE SINCE BEEN INFORMED TO VERY SERIOUS EVENTS IN ROMAYNE'S LATER LIFE
4480-44312-0074 LORD LORING WELL KNOWN IN SOCIETY AS THE HEAD OF AN OLD ENGLISH CATHOLIC FAMILY AND THE POSSESSOR OF A MAGNIFICENT GALLERY OF PICTURES WAS DISTRESSED BY THE CHANGE FOR THE WORSE WHICH HE PERCEIVED IN ROMAYNE WHEN HE CALLED AT THE HOTEL
4480-44312-0075 I WAS PRESENT WHEN THEY MET AND ROSE TO LEAVE THE ROOM FEELING THAT THE TWO FRIENDS MIGHT PERHAPS BE EMBARRASSED BY THE PRESENCE OF A THIRD PERSON ROMAYNE CALLED ME BACK LORD LORING OUGHT TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME HE SAID I HAVE NO HEART TO SPEAK OF IT MYSELF
4480-44312-0076 WITH THOSE WORDS HE LEFT US TOGETHER IT IS ALMOST NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT LORD LORING DID AGREE WITH ME HE WAS HIMSELF DISPOSED TO THINK THAT THE MORAL REMEDY IN ROMAYNE'S CASE MIGHT PROVE TO BE THE BEST REMEDY
4480-44312-0077 WHY SHOULDN'T HE MARRY A WOMAN'S INFLUENCE BY MERELY GIVING A NEW TURN TO HIS THOUGHTS MIGHT CHARM AWAY THAT HORRIBLE VOICE WHICH HAUNTS HIM PERHAPS YOU THINK THIS A MERELY SENTIMENTAL VIEW OF THE CASE LOOK AT IT PRACTICALLY IF YOU LIKE AND YOU COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION
4480-44312-0078 WITH THAT FINE ESTATE AND WITH THE FORTUNE WHICH HE HAS NOW INHERITED FROM HIS AUNT IT IS HIS DUTY TO MARRY DON'T YOU AGREE WITH ME I AGREE MOST CORDIALLY BUT I SEE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR LORDSHIP'S WAY
4480-44312-0079 ROMAYNE DISLIKES SOCIETY AND AS TO MARRYING HIS COLDNESS TOWARD WOMEN SEEMS SO FAR AS I CAN JUDGE TO BE ONE OF THE INCURABLE DEFECTS OF HIS CHARACTER LORD LORING SMILED MY DEAR SIR
4480-44312-0080 NOTHING OF THAT SORT IS INCURABLE IF WE CAN ONLY FIND THE RIGHT WOMAN THE TONE IN WHICH HE SPOKE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD GOT THE RIGHT WOMAN AND I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF SAYING SO HE AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT I HAD GUESSED RIGHT
4480-44312-0081 AT THE RIGHT MOMENT I SHALL SEND WORD UPSTAIRS SHE MAY WELL HAPPEN TO LOOK IN AT THE GALLERY BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT JUST AT THE TIME WHEN ROMAYNE IS LOOKING AT MY NEW PICTURES THE REST DEPENDS OF COURSE ON THE EFFECT SHE PRODUCES
4480-44312-0082 NO ONE HOWEVER COULD DOUBT LORD LORING'S ADMIRABLE DEVOTION TO HIS FRIEND AND WITH THAT I WAS FAIN TO BE CONTENT
4480-44312-0083 WHEN LORD LORING TOOK HIS DEPARTURE I ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL PERCEIVING THAT HE WISHED TO SAY A WORD MORE TO ME IN PRIVATE HE HAD IT SEEMED DECIDED ON WAITING FOR THE RESULT OF THE MEDICAL CONSULTATION BEFORE HE TRIED THE EFFECT OF THE YOUNG LADY'S ATTRACTIONS
4480-44312-0084 AND HE WISHED TO CAUTION ME AGAINST SPEAKING PREMATURELY OF VISITING THE PICTURE GALLERY TO OUR FRIEND NOT FEELING PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THESE DETAILS OF THE WORTHY NOBLEMAN'S LITTLE PLOT I LOOKED AT HIS CARRIAGE AND PRIVATELY ADMIRED THE TWO SPLENDID HORSES THAT DREW IT
4480-44312-0085 I RECOGNIZED THE ELDERLY FAT AND CHEERFUL PRIEST WHO HAD SHOWN SUCH A KNOWLEDGE OF LOCALITIES AND SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST IN VANGE ABBEY
4480-44312-0086 AND MIGHT HAVE RECKONED THE CIRCUMSTANCE AMONG THE WISELY IMPROVED OPPORTUNITIES OF MY LIFE TO RETURN TO THE SERIOUS INTERESTS OF THE PRESENT NARRATIVE I MAY NOW ANNOUNCE THAT MY EVIDENCE AS AN EYE WITNESS OF EVENTS HAS COME TO AN END
4480-44312-0087 AND THAT IT MAY BE DEPENDED ON THROUGHOUT AS AN EXACT STATEMENT OF THE TRUTH
