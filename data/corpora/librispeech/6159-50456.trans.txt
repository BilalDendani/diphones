6159-50456-0000 WAVERLEY TURNED AND WAS WARMLY EMBRACED BY FERGUS MAC IVOR A THOUSAND WELCOMES TO HOLYROOD ONCE MORE POSSESSED BY HER LEGITIMATE SOVEREIGN DID I NOT SAY WE SHOULD PROSPER AND THAT YOU WOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE PHILISTINES IF YOU PARTED FROM US
6159-50456-0001 DEAR FERGUS SAID WAVERLEY EAGERLY RETURNING HIS GREETING IT IS LONG SINCE I HAVE HEARD A FRIEND'S VOICE WHERE IS FLORA SAFE AND A TRIUMPHANT SPECTATOR OF OUR SUCCESS IN THIS PLACE SAID WAVERLEY AY
6159-50456-0002 IN THIS CITY AT LEAST ANSWERED HIS FRIEND
6159-50456-0003 WHO HAS BEEN FREQUENT IN HIS INQUIRIES AFTER YOU THUS SAYING HE DRAGGED WAVERLEY BY THE ARM OUT OF THE GUARD CHAMBER AND ERE HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS CONDUCTED EDWARD FOUND HIMSELF IN A PRESENCE ROOM FITTED UP WITH SOME ATTEMPT AT ROYAL STATE
6159-50456-0004 A YOUNG MAN WEARING HIS OWN FAIR HAIR DISTINGUISHED BY THE DIGNITY OF HIS MIEN AND THE NOBLE EXPRESSION OF HIS WELL FORMED AND REGULAR FEATURES ADVANCED OUT OF A CIRCLE OF MILITARY GENTLEMEN AND HIGHLAND CHIEFS BY WHOM HE WAS SURROUNDED
6159-50456-0005 IN HIS EASY AND GRACEFUL MANNERS WAVERLEY AFTERWARDS THOUGHT HE COULD HAVE DISCOVERED HIS HIGH BIRTH AND RANK ALTHOUGH THE STAR ON HIS BREAST AND THE EMBROIDERED GARTER AT HIS KNEE HAD NOT APPEARED AS ITS INDICATIONS LET ME PRESENT TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SAID FERGUS BOWING PROFOUNDLY
6159-50456-0006 SAID THE YOUNG CHEVALIER INTERRUPTING HIM I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MY DEAR MAC IVOR
6159-50456-0007 THUS SAYING HE EXTENDED HIS HAND TO EDWARD WITH THE UTMOST COURTESY WHO COULD NOT HAD HE DESIRED IT HAVE AVOIDED RENDERING HIM THE HOMAGE WHICH SEEMED DUE TO HIS RANK AND WAS CERTAINLY THE RIGHT OF HIS BIRTH I AM SORRY TO UNDERSTAND MISTER WAVERLEY THAT
6159-50456-0008 OWING TO CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN AS YET BUT ILL EXPLAINED YOU HAVE SUFFERED SOME RESTRAINT AMONG MY FOLLOWERS IN PERTHSHIRE AND ON YOUR MARCH HERE BUT WE ARE IN SUCH A SITUATION THAT WE HARDLY KNOW OUR FRIENDS
6159-50456-0009 AND I AM EVEN AT THIS MOMENT UNCERTAIN WHETHER I CAN HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CONSIDERING MISTER WAVERLEY AS AMONG MINE HE THEN PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT BUT BEFORE EDWARD COULD ADJUST A SUITABLE REPLY OR EVEN ARRANGE HIS IDEAS AS TO ITS PURPORT THE PRINCE TOOK OUT A PAPER AND THEN PROCEEDED
6159-50456-0010 SET FORTH BY THE FRIENDS OF THE ELECTOR OF HANOVER IN WHICH THEY RANK MISTER WAVERLEY AMONG THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY WHO ARE MENACED WITH THE PAINS OF HIGH TREASON FOR LOYALTY TO THEIR LEGITIMATE SOVEREIGN BUT I DESIRE TO GAIN NO ADHERENTS SAVE FROM AFFECTION AND CONVICTION
6159-50456-0011 OR TO JOIN THE FORCES OF THE ELECTOR HE SHALL HAVE MY PASSPORT AND FREE PERMISSION TO DO SO AND I CAN ONLY REGRET THAT MY PRESENT POWER WILL NOT EXTEND TO PROTECT HIM AGAINST THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A MEASURE BUT CONTINUED CHARLES EDWARD AFTER ANOTHER SHORT PAUSE
6159-50456-0012 IF MISTER WAVERLEY SHOULD LIKE HIS ANCESTOR SIR NIGEL DETERMINE TO EMBRACE A CAUSE WHICH HAS LITTLE TO RECOMMEND IT BUT ITS JUSTICE AND FOLLOW A PRINCE WHO THROWS HIMSELF UPON THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE TO RECOVER THE THRONE OF HIS ANCESTORS OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT
6159-50456-0013 I CAN ONLY SAY THAT AMONG THESE NOBLES AND GENTLEMEN HE WILL FIND WORTHY ASSOCIATES IN A GALLANT ENTERPRISE AND WILL FOLLOW A MASTER WHO MAY BE UNFORTUNATE BUT I TRUST WILL NEVER BE UNGRATEFUL THE POLITIC CHIEFTAIN
6159-50456-0014 UNACCUSTOMED TO THE ADDRESS AND MANNERS OF A POLISHED COURT IN WHICH CHARLES WAS EMINENTLY SKILFUL
6159-50456-0015 AND EASILY OUTWEIGHED ALL PRUDENTIAL MOTIVES TO BE THUS PERSONALLY SOLICITED FOR ASSISTANCE BY A PRINCE WHOSE FORM AND MANNERS
6159-50456-0016 ANSWERED HIS IDEAS OF A HERO OF ROMANCE
6159-50456-0017 RECOVERED BY THE SWORD WHICH HE WAS ALREADY BENDING TOWARDS OTHER CONQUESTS GAVE EDWARD IN HIS OWN EYES THE DIGNITY AND IMPORTANCE WHICH HE HAD CEASED TO CONSIDER AS HIS ATTRIBUTES REJECTED SLANDERED AND THREATENED UPON THE ONE SIDE
6159-50456-0018 HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED TO THE CAUSE WHICH THE PREJUDICES OF EDUCATION AND THE POLITICAL PRINCIPLES OF HIS FAMILY HAD ALREADY RECOMMENDED AS THE MOST JUST THESE THOUGHTS RUSHED THROUGH HIS MIND LIKE A TORRENT
6159-50456-0019 SWEEPING BEFORE THEM EVERY CONSIDERATION OF AN OPPOSITE TENDENCY THE TIME BESIDES ADMITTED OF NO DELIBERATION AND WAVERLEY KNEELING TO CHARLES EDWARD
6159-50456-0020 THE PRINCE FOR ALTHOUGH UNFORTUNATE IN THE FAULTS AND FOLLIES OF HIS FOREFATHERS
6159-50456-0021 HE REALLY LOVED WAVERLEY BECAUSE THEIR FEELINGS AND PROJECTS NEVER THWARTED EACH OTHER HE HOPED TO SEE HIM UNITED WITH FLORA
6159-50456-0022 BUT AS WE BEFORE HINTED HE ALSO EXULTED AS A POLITICIAN IN BEHOLDING SECURED TO HIS PARTY A PARTIZAN OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE AND HE WAS FAR FROM BEING INSENSIBLE TO THE PERSONAL IMPORTANCE WHICH HE HIMSELF GAINED WITH THE PRINCE FROM HAVING SO MATERIALLY
6159-50456-0023 CHARLES EDWARD ON HIS PART SEEMED EAGER TO SHOW HIS ATTENDANTS THE VALUE WHICH HE ATTACHED TO HIS NEW ADHERENT BY ENTERING IMMEDIATELY AS IN CONFIDENCE UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS SITUATION YOU HAVE BEEN SECLUDED SO MUCH FROM INTELLIGENCE MISTER WAVERLEY
6159-50456-0024 FROM CAUSES OF WHICH I AM BUT INDISTINCTLY INFORMED THAT I PRESUME YOU ARE EVEN YET UNACQUAINTED WITH THE IMPORTANT PARTICULARS OF MY PRESENT SITUATION
6159-50456-0025 DISTRICT OF MOIDART WITH ONLY SEVEN ATTENDANTS AND OF THE NUMEROUS CHIEFS AND CLANS WHOSE LOYAL ENTHUSIASM AT ONCE PLACED A SOLITARY ADVENTURER AT THE HEAD OF A GALLANT ARMY YOU MUST ALSO I THINK HAVE LEARNED THAT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE HANOVERIAN ELECTOR
6159-50456-0026 SIR JOHN COPE MARCHED INTO THE HIGHLANDS AT THE HEAD OF A NUMEROUS AND WELL APPOINTED MILITARY FORCE WITH THE INTENTION OF GIVING US BATTLE BUT THAT HIS COURAGE FAILED HIM WHEN WE WERE WITHIN THREE HOURS MARCH OF EACH OTHER
6159-50456-0027 SO THAT HE FAIRLY GAVE US THE SLIP AND MARCHED NORTHWARD TO ABERDEEN LEAVING THE LOW COUNTRY OPEN AND UNDEFENDED NOT TO LOSE SO FAVOURABLE AN OPPORTUNITY I MARCHED ON TO THIS METROPOLIS DRIVING BEFORE ME TWO REGIMENTS OF HORSE
6159-50456-0028 GARDINER'S AND HAMILTON'S WHO HAD THREATENED TO CUT TO PIECES EVERY HIGHLANDER THAT SHOULD VENTURE TO PASS STIRLING AND WHILE DISCUSSIONS WERE CARRYING FORWARD AMONG THE MAGISTRACY AND CITIZENS OF EDINBURGH WHETHER THEY SHOULD DEFEND THEMSELVES OR SURRENDER MY GOOD FRIEND LOCHIEL
6159-50456-0029 LAYING HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF THAT GALLANT AND ACCOMPLISHED CHIEFTAIN SAVED THEM THE TROUBLE OF FARTHER DELIBERATION BY ENTERING THE GATES WITH FIVE HUNDRED CAMERONS THUS FAR THEREFORE WE HAVE DONE WELL BUT IN THE MEANWHILE
6159-50456-0030 THIS DOUGHTY GENERAL'S NERVES BEING BRACED BY THE KEEN AIR OF ABERDEEN HE HAS TAKEN SHIPPING FOR DUNBAR AND I HAVE JUST RECEIVED CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT HE LANDED THERE YESTERDAY
6159-50456-0031 ONE THAT BEING INFERIOR PROBABLY IN NUMBERS AND CERTAINLY IN DISCIPLINE AND MILITARY APPOINTMENTS NOT TO MENTION OUR TOTAL WANT OF ARTILLERY AND THE WEAKNESS OF OUR CAVALRY IT WILL BE SAFEST TO FALL BACK TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS AND THERE PROTRACT THE WAR UNTIL FRESH SUCCOURS ARRIVE FROM FRANCE
6159-50456-0032 THE OPPOSITE OPINION MAINTAINS THAT A RETROGRADE MOVEMENT IN OUR CIRCUMSTANCES IS CERTAIN TO THROW UTTER DISCREDIT ON OUR ARMS AND UNDERTAKING AND FAR FROM GAINING US NEW PARTIZANS WILL BE THE MEANS OF DISHEARTENING THOSE WHO HAVE JOINED OUR STANDARD
6159-50456-0033 THE OFFICERS WHO USE THESE LAST ARGUMENTS AMONG WHOM IS YOUR FRIEND FERGUS MAC IVOR MAINTAIN THAT IF THE HIGHLANDERS ARE STRANGERS TO THE USUAL MILITARY DISCIPLINE OF EUROPE THE SOLDIERS WHOM THEY ARE TO ENCOUNTER ARE NO LESS STRANGERS TO THEIR PECULIAR AND FORMIDABLE MODE OF ATTACK
6159-50456-0034 THAT THE ATTACHMENT AND COURAGE OF THE CHIEFS AND GENTLEMEN ARE NOT TO BE DOUBTED AND THAT AS THEY WILL BE IN THE MIDST OF THE ENEMY THEIR CLANSMEN WILL AS SURELY FOLLOW THEM IN FINE THAT HAVING DRAWN THE SWORD WE SHOULD THROW AWAY THE SCABBARD AND TRUST OUR CAUSE TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF BATTLES
6159-50456-0035 THAT HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO OFFER AN OPINION AS DERIVED FROM MILITARY SKILL BUT THAT THE COUNSEL WOULD BE FAR THE MOST ACCEPTABLE TO HIM WHICH SHOULD FIRST AFFORD HIM AN OPPORTUNITY
6159-50456-0036 ALLOW ME INSTEAD OF THE CAPTAIN'S COMMISSION WHICH YOU HAVE LOST
6159-50456-0037 WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF ACTING AS ONE OF MY AIDES DE CAMP UNTIL YOU CAN BE ATTACHED TO A REGIMENT OF WHICH I HOPE SEVERAL WILL BE SPEEDILY EMBODIED YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL FORGIVE ME ANSWERED WAVERLEY
6159-50456-0038 IN THE MEANWHILE I HOPE FOR YOUR PERMISSION TO SERVE AS A VOLUNTEER UNDER MY FRIEND FERGUS MAC IVOR AT LEAST SAID THE PRINCE WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL ALLOW ME THE PLEASURE OF ARMING YOU AFTER THE HIGHLAND FASHION WITH THESE WORDS HE UNBUCKLED THE BROADSWORD WHICH HE WORE
6159-50456-0039 THE BELT OF WHICH WAS PLAITED WITH SILVER AND THE STEEL BASKET HILT RICHLY AND CURIOUSLY INLAID THE BLADE SAID THE PRINCE IS A GENUINE ANDREA FERRARA IT HAS BEEN A SORT OF HEIR LOOM IN OUR FAMILY BUT I AM CONVINCED I PUT IT INTO BETTER HANDS THAN MY OWN
6159-50456-0040 AND WILL ADD TO IT PISTOLS OF THE SAME WORKMANSHIP COLONEL MAC IVOR YOU MUST HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO YOUR FRIEND I WILL DETAIN YOU NO LONGER FROM YOUR PRIVATE CONVERSATION
