6211-66280-0000 AND THE OLD MAN WHO HAD REBUKED THIODOLF AND WHO WAS JORUND OF THE WOLFINGS CAME UP TO HIM AND REACHED OUT TO HIM THE HAUBERK AND HE DID IT ON SCARCE HEEDING FOR ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL WAS TURNED TOWARD THE BATTLE OF THE ROMANS AND WHAT THEY WERE A DOING
6211-66280-0001 AND HE SAW THAT THEY WERE FALLING BACK IN GOOD ORDER AS MEN OUT NUMBERED BUT UNDISMAYED SO HE GATHERED ALL HIS MEN TOGETHER AND ORDERED THEM AFRESH FOR THEY WERE SOMEWHAT DISARRAYED WITH THE FRAY AND THE CHASE
6211-66280-0002 AND NOW HE NO LONGER ORDERED THEM IN THE WEDGE ARRAY BUT IN A LINE HERE THREE DEEP HERE FIVE DEEP OR MORE FOR THE FOES WERE HARD AT HAND AND OUTNUMBERED AND SO FAR OVERCOME THAT HE AND ALL MEN DEEMED IT A LITTLE MATTER TO GIVE THESE THEIR LAST OVERTHROW
6211-66280-0003 AND THEN ONWARD TO WOLF STEAD TO STORM ON WHAT WAS LEFT THERE AND PURGE THE HOUSE OF THE FOEMEN HOWBEIT THIODOLF BETHOUGHT HIM THAT SUCCOUR MIGHT COME TO THE ROMANS FROM THEIR MAIN BATTLE
6211-66280-0004 BUT THE THOUGHT WAS DIM WITHIN HIM FOR ONCE MORE SINCE HE HAD GOTTEN THE HAUBERK ON HIM THE EARTH WAS WAVERING AND DREAM LIKE HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
6211-66280-0005 AND HOPED FOR NOTHING SAVE THE VICTORY BUT NOW INDEED THE WOOD SUN SEEMED TO HIM TO BE BESIDE HIM AND NOT AGAINST HIS WILL AS ONE BESETTING AND HINDERING HIM BUT AS THOUGH HIS OWN LONGING HAD DRAWN HER THITHER AND WOULD NOT LET HER DEPART
6211-66280-0006 FOR THE REST HE SEEMED TO BE IN A DREAM INDEED AND AS MEN DO IN DREAMS TO BE FOR EVER STRIVING TO BE DOING SOMETHING OF MORE MOMENT THAN ANYTHING WHICH HE DID BUT WHICH HE MUST EVER LEAVE UNDONE
6211-66280-0007 AND AS THE DREAM GATHERED AND THICKENED ABOUT HIM THE FOE BEFORE HIM CHANGED TO HIS EYES AND SEEMED NO LONGER THE STERN BROWN SKINNED SMOOTH FACED MEN UNDER THEIR CRESTED IRON HELMS WITH THEIR IRON COVERED SHIELDS BEFORE THEM
6211-66280-0008 THUS TARRIED THE KINDREDS AWHILE
6211-66280-0009 BUT AS FOR THE ROMANS THEY HAD NOW STAYED AND WERE FACING THEIR FOES AGAIN AND THAT ON A VANTAGE GROUND SINCE THE FIELD SLOPED UP TOWARD THE WOLFING DWELLING AND THEY GATHERED HEART WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE GOTHS TARRIED AND FORBORE THEM
6211-66280-0010 BUT THE SUN WAS SINKING AND THE EVENING WAS HARD AT HAND SO AT LAST THIODOLF LED FORWARD WITH THRONG PLOUGH HELD ALOFT IN HIS RIGHT HAND BUT HIS LEFT HAND HE HELD OUT BY HIS SIDE AS THOUGH HE WERE LEADING SOMEONE ALONG AND AS HE WENT HE MUTTERED
6211-66280-0011 THAT WE MAY BE ALONE AND TAKE PLEASURE EACH IN EACH AMIDST OF THE FLOWERS AND THE SUN NOW AS THE TWO HOSTS DREW NEAR TO ONE ANOTHER AGAIN CAME THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS AFAR OFF
6211-66280-0012 AND MEN KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE SUCCOUR COMING TO THE ROMANS FROM THEIR MAIN BATTLE AND THE ROMANS THEREON SHOUTED FOR JOY AND THE HOST OF THE KINDREDS MIGHT NO LONGER FORBEAR BUT RUSHED ON FIERCELY AGAINST THEM
6211-66280-0013 YET HAD HE THRONG PLOUGH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND HE MUTTERED IN HIS BEARD AS HE WENT SMITE BEFORE SMITE BEHIND AND SMITE ON THE RIGHT HAND BUT NEVER ON THE LEFT
6211-66280-0014 YET WERE MANY OF THE KINDRED ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED
6211-66280-0015 AND AT LAST AS THE MEN OF THE KINDREDS WERE GROWING A WEARIED WITH FIGHTING THEY HEARD THOSE HORNS AS IT WERE IN THEIR VERY EARS AND THE THUNDER OF THE TRAMP OF FOOTMEN
6211-66280-0016 THEN THOSE THEY HAD BEEN FIGHTING WITH OPENED BEFORE THEM FALLING ASIDE TO THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT AND THE FRESH MEN PASSING BETWEEN THEM FELL ON THE GOTHS LIKE THE WATERS OF A RIVER WHEN A SLUICE GATE IS OPENED
6211-66280-0017 THEY CAME ON IN VERY GOOD ORDER NEVER BREAKING THEIR RANKS BUT SWIFT WITHAL SMITING AND PUSHING BEFORE THEM AND SO BRAKE THROUGH THE ARRAY OF THE GOTH FOLK AND DRAVE THEM THIS WAY AND THAT WAY DOWN THE SLOPES
6211-66280-0018 YET STILL FOUGHT THE WARRIORS OF THE KINDRED MOST VALIANTLY MAKING STAND AND FACING THE FOE AGAIN AND AGAIN IN KNOTS OF A SCORE OR TWO SCORE OR MAYBE TEN SCORE AND THOUGH MANY A MAN WAS SLAIN YET SCARCE ANY ONE BEFORE HE HAD SLAIN OR HURT A ROMAN
6211-66280-0019 AND SOME THERE WERE AND THEY THE OLDEST WHO FOUGHT AS IF THEY AND THE FEW ABOUT THEM WERE ALL THE HOST THAT WAS LEFT TO THE FOLK AND HEEDED NOT THAT OTHERS WERE DRIVEN BACK OR THAT THE ROMANS GATHERED ABOUT THEM CUTTING THEM OFF FROM ALL SUCCOUR AND AID
6211-66280-0020 BUT WENT ON SMITING TILL THEY WERE FELLED WITH MANY STROKES HOWBEIT THE ARRAY OF THE GOTHS WAS BROKEN AND MANY WERE SLAIN AND PERFORCE THEY MUST GIVE BACK AND IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WOULD BE DRIVEN INTO THE RIVER AND ALL BE LOST
6211-66280-0021 BUT FOR THIODOLF THIS BEFELL HIM THAT AT FIRST WHEN THOSE FRESH MEN FELL ON HE SEEMED AS IT WERE TO WAKE UNTO HIMSELF AGAIN AND HE CRIED ALOUD THE CRY OF THE WOLF AND THRUST INTO THE THICKEST OF THE FRAY AND SLEW MANY AND WAS HURT OF NONE
6211-66280-0022 AND FOR A MOMENT OF TIME THERE WAS AN EMPTY SPACE ROUND ABOUT HIM SUCH FEAR HE CAST EVEN INTO THE VALIANT HEARTS OF THE FOEMEN BUT THOSE WHO HAD TIME TO SEE HIM AS THEY STOOD BY HIM NOTED THAT HE WAS AS PALE AS A DEAD MAN AND HIS EYES SET AND STARING
6211-66280-0023 AND SO OF A SUDDEN WHILE HE STOOD THUS THREATENING THE RING OF DOUBTFUL FOEMEN THE WEAKNESS TOOK HIM AGAIN THRONG PLOUGH TUMBLED FROM HIS HAND AND HE FELL TO EARTH AS ONE DEAD
6211-66280-0024 TILL HE COULD DO NO MORE AND SOME THAT THERE WAS A CURSE ABROAD THAT HAD FALLEN UPON HIM AND UPON ALL THE KINDREDS OF THE MARK SOME THOUGHT HIM DEAD AND SOME SWOONING BUT DEAD OR ALIVE THE WARRIORS WOULD NOT LEAVE THEIR WAR DUKE AMONG THE FOEMEN
6211-66280-0025 AND THE ROMANS MIGHT NOT BREAK THEM INTO KNOTS OF DESPERATE MEN ANY MORE
6211-66280-0026 WITH A MIND TO MAKE A STAND FOR LIFE OR DEATH ON SOME VANTAGE GROUND AND SO OFTEN TURNING UPON THE ROMANS THEY CAME IN ARRAY EVER GROWING MORE SOLID TO THE RISING GROUND LOOKING ONE WAY OVER THE FORD AND THE OTHER TO THE SLOPES WHERE THE BATTLE HAD JUST BEEN
6211-66280-0027 THERE THEY FACED THE FOE AS MEN WHO MAY BE SLAIN BUT WILL BE DRIVEN NO FURTHER AND WHAT BOWMEN THEY HAD GOT SPREAD OUT FROM THEIR FLANKS AND SHOT ON THE ROMANS WHO HAD WITH THEM NO LIGHT ARMED OR SLINGERS OR BOWMEN FOR THEY HAD LEFT THEM AT WOLF STEAD
6211-66280-0028 FOR THESE HAD LOST THEIR LEADER EITHER SLAIN AS SOME THOUGHT OR AS OTHERS THOUGHT BANNED FROM LEADERSHIP BY THE GODS AND THEIR HOST WAS HEAVY HEARTED AND THOUGH IT IS LIKE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE STOOD THERE TILL EACH HAD FALLEN OVER OTHER YET WAS THEIR HOPE GROWN DIM
6211-66280-0029 AND THE WHOLE FOLK BROUGHT TO A PERILOUS AND FEARFUL PASS FOR IF THESE WERE SLAIN OR SCATTERED THERE WERE NO MORE BUT THEY AND NOUGHT BETWEEN FIRE AND THE SWORD AND THE PEOPLE OF THE MARK BUT ONCE AGAIN THE FAINT HEART FOLLY OF THE ROMAN CAPTAIN SAVED HIS FOES
6211-66280-0030 SO NOW HE RAN HIS HEAD INTO THE OTHER HEDGE
6211-66280-0031 AND THAT THEY WERE OVER BIG FOR HIM TO MEDDLE WITH TRUE IT IS ALSO THAT NOW DARK NIGHT WAS COMING ON AND THE LAND WAS UNKNOWN TO THE ROMANS WHO MOREOVER TRUSTED NOT WHOLLY TO THE DASTARDS OF THE GOTHS WHO WERE THEIR GUIDES AND SCOUTS
6211-66280-0032 FURTHERMORE THE WOOD WAS AT HAND AND THEY KNEW NOT WHAT IT HELD AND WITH ALL THIS AND ABOVE IT ALL IT IS TO BE SAID THAT OVER THEM ALSO HAD FALLEN A DREAD OF SOME DOOM ANEAR FOR THOSE HABITATIONS AMIDST OF THE WILD WOODS WERE TERRIBLE TO THEM AS THEY WERE DEAR TO THE GOTHS
6211-66280-0033 SCARCE A HILL EVEN NOUGHT BUT A GENTLE SWELLING OF THE EARTH THEY FOREBORE THEM AND RAISING UP THE WHOOP OF VICTORY DREW SLOWLY ABACK PICKING UP THEIR OWN DEAD AND WOUNDED AND SLAYING THE WOUNDED MARKMEN
