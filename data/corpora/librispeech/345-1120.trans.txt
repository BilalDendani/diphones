345-1120-0000 AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE
345-1120-0001 THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY HIS ANXIETY FOR JANE WAS EVIDENT
345-1120-0002 BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN WHO LIVED ONLY TO EAT DRINK AND PLAY AT CARDS WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE
345-1120-0003 AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM HER MANNERS WERE PRONOUNCED TO BE VERY BAD INDEED A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND IMPERTINENCE SHE HAD NO CONVERSATION NO STYLE NO BEAUTY MISSUS HURST THOUGHT THE SAME AND ADDED
345-1120-0004 SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY COUNTENANCE
345-1120-0005 VERY NONSENSICAL TO COME AT ALL WHY MUST SHE BE SCAMPERING ABOUT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE HER SISTER HAD A COLD HER HAIR SO UNTIDY SO BLOWSY YES AND HER PETTICOAT I HOPE YOU SAW HER PETTICOAT SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM
345-1120-0006 I THOUGHT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET LOOKED REMARKABLY WELL WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM THIS MORNING HER DIRTY PETTICOAT QUITE ESCAPED MY NOTICE YOU OBSERVED IT MISTER DARCY I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE YOUR SISTER MAKE SUCH AN EXHIBITION
345-1120-0007 CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES OR WHATEVER IT IS ABOVE HER ANKLES IN DIRT AND ALONE QUITE ALONE WHAT COULD SHE MEAN BY IT IT SEEMS TO ME TO SHOW AN ABOMINABLE SORT OF CONCEITED INDEPENDENCE
345-1120-0008 A MOST COUNTRY TOWN INDIFFERENCE TO DECORUM IT SHOWS AN AFFECTION FOR HER SISTER THAT IS VERY PLEASING SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER
345-1120-0009 SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT I THINK I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT THEIR UNCLE IS AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON YES
345-1120-0010 AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY IF THEY HAD UNCLES ENOUGH TO FILL ALL CHEAPSIDE CRIED BINGLEY IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE
345-1120-0011 BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
345-1120-0012 WITH A RENEWAL OF TENDERNESS HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO HER ROOM ON LEAVING THE DINING PARLOUR AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING
345-1120-0013 WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
345-1120-0014 AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
345-1120-0015 MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE I DESERVE NEITHER SUCH PRAISE NOR SUCH CENSURE CRIED ELIZABETH
345-1120-0016 I AM NOT A GREAT READER AND I HAVE PLEASURE IN MANY THINGS IN NURSING YOUR SISTER I AM SURE YOU HAVE PLEASURE SAID BINGLEY AND I HOPE IT WILL BE SOON INCREASED BY SEEING HER QUITE WELL ELIZABETH THANKED HIM FROM HER HEART
345-1120-0017 AND THEN WALKED TOWARDS THE TABLE WHERE A FEW BOOKS WERE LYING HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
345-1120-0018 ELIZABETH ASSURED HIM THAT SHE COULD SUIT HERSELF PERFECTLY WITH THOSE IN THE ROOM I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY
345-1120-0019 IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE ADDED SO MUCH TO IT YOURSELF YOU ARE ALWAYS BUYING BOOKS I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE NEGLECT OF A FAMILY LIBRARY IN SUCH DAYS AS THESE
345-1120-0020 NEGLECT I AM SURE YOU NEGLECT NOTHING THAT CAN ADD TO THE BEAUTIES OF THAT NOBLE PLACE CHARLES WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE I WISH IT MAY BE HALF AS DELIGHTFUL AS PEMBERLEY I WISH IT MAY
345-1120-0021 SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY HOW YOUNG LADIES CAN HAVE PATIENCE TO BE SO VERY ACCOMPLISHED AS THEY ALL ARE
345-1120-0022 I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN
345-1120-0023 YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT OH CERTAINLY CRIED HIS FAITHFUL ASSISTANT NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING
345-1120-0024 ALL THIS SHE MUST POSSESS ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
345-1120-0025 I RATHER WONDER NOW AT YOUR KNOWING ANY ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
345-1120-0026 ELIZABETH BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON HER IS ONE OF THOSE YOUNG LADIES WHO SEEK TO RECOMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE OTHER SEX BY UNDERVALUING THEIR OWN AND WITH MANY MEN I DARE SAY IT SUCCEEDS
345-1120-0027 BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS A PALTRY DEVICE A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
345-1120-0028 WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL
345-1120-0029 AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
