4807-26853-0027 AS FOLLOWS THE SARDINE CARS CONSIST OF FIFTY PEOPLE TRYING TO SQUEEZE INTO A SPACE THAT WAS BUILT ONLY FOR A PAJAMA HAT AND TWO NEWSPAPERS THE SEATS IN THE SARDINE CARS RUN SIDEWAYS
4807-26853-0028 OF A ROUGH HOUSE THAT HAS EVER BEEN INVENTED THE ARE CALLED SARDINE CARS BECAUSE THE CONDUCTOR HAS TO LET THE PASSENGERS OUT WITH A CAN OPENER BRAVE AND STRONG MEN CLIMB INTO A STREET CAR AND THEY ARE FULL OF HEALTH AND LIFE AND VIGOR
4807-26853-0029 BUT A FEW BLOCKS UP THE ROAD THEY FALL OUT BACKWARDS AND INQUIRE FEEBLY FOR A SANITARIUM TO RIDE ON THE STREET CARS IN A BIG CITY OF AN EVENING BRINGS OUT ALL THAT IS IN A MAN INCLUDING A LOT OF LOUD WORDS HE DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD
4807-26853-0030 THE LAST CENSUS SHOWS US THAT THE STREET CARS IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK HAVE MORE WAYS OF PRODUCING NERVOUS PROSTRATION AND PALPITATION OF THE BRAIN TO THE SQUARE INCH THAN THE COMBINED POPULATION OF AMSTERDAM ROTTERDAM TINKERSDAM
4807-26853-0031 AND GOTTERDAMMERUNG TO GET IN SOME OF THE STREET CARS ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK IS A PROBLEM AND TO GET OUT AGAIN IS AN ASSASSINATION ONE EVENING I RODE FROM FORTY SECOND STREET TO FIFTY NINTH WITHOUT ONCE TOUCHING THE FLOOR WITH MY FEET
4807-26853-0032 PART OF THE TIME I USED THE OUTPOSTS OF A STOUT GENTLEMAN TO COME BETWEEN ME AND THE GROUND AND DURING THE REST OF THE OCCASION I HUNG ON TO A STRAP AND SWUNG OUT WILD AND FREE LIKE THE JAPANESE FLAG ON A WINDY DAY SOME OF OUR STREET CARS LEAD A DOUBLE LIFE
4807-26853-0033 BECAUSE THEY ARE USED ALL WINTER TO ACT THE PART OF A REFRIGERATOR
4807-26853-0034 IN THE STREET CARS IN GERMANY WE FIND GERMANS IN THE CARS BUT IN AMERICA WE FIND GERMS THAT IS BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY IS YOUNG AND IMPULSIVE
4807-26853-0035 BECAUSE THE LAW SAYS WE MUST NOT BE DISRESPECTFUL TO THE DUMB BRUTES OF THE FIELD MANY OF OUR STREET CARS ARE MADE OUT OF THE SAME IDEA AS A CAN OF CONDENSED MILK THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE STREET CARS HAVE A SOUR TASTE LIKE A LEMON SQUEEZER WHEN YOU GET OUT
4807-26853-0036 YOU CANNOT GET IN AND WHEN YOU GET IN YOU CANNOT GET OUT
4807-26853-0037 UNLESS ONE OF THEM HAPPENS TO HAVE A WOODEN LEG UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES FOUR INTO TWO WON'T GO BUT THE SARDINE CARS DEFY THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION A SARDINE CAR CONDUCTOR CAN PUT TWENTY SIX INTO NINE AND STILL HAVE FOUR TO CARRY THE IDEA OF EXPANSION
4807-26853-0038 WHICH IS NOW USED BY OUR CONGRESS WAS SUGGESTED BY ONE OF THESE SARDINE CARS THE LADIES OF AMERICA HAVE STARTED A REBELLION AGAINST THE SARDINE CARS BUT EVERY TIME THEY START IT THE CONDUCTOR PULLS THE BELL AND LEAVES THE REBELLIOUS STANDING ON THE CORNER WE ARE A VERY NERVOUS AND CARELESS PEOPLE IN AMERICA
4807-26853-0039 TO PROVE HOW CARELESS WE ARE I WILL CITE THE FACT THAT MANHATTAN ISLAND IS CALLED AFTER A COCKTAIL THIS NERVOUSNESS IS OUR UNDOING BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS IN SUCH A HURRY TO GET SOMEWHERE THAT WE WOULD RATHER TAKE THE FIRST CAR AND GET SQUEEZED INTO BREATHLESSNESS
4807-26853-0040 THAN WAIT FOR THE NEXT WHICH WOULD LIKELY SQUEEZE US INTO INSENSIBILITY BREATHLESSNESS CAN BE CURED BUT INSENSIBILITY IS DANGEROUS WITHOUT AN ALARM CLOCK FOR A MAN WITH A SMALL DINING ROOM THE SARDINE CAR HAS ITS ADVANTAGES

4807-26853-0043 WHEN I REMONSTRATED WITH HIM HE REPLIED THAT THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY AND IF HE WISHED TO SIT DOWN I HAD NO BUSINESS TO STOP HIM THEN HIS FRIEND PULLED US APART AND I RESUMED THE USE OF MY LAP
4807-26853-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWENTY BLOCKS I HAD ONE OF THE WORST DAYLIGHT NIGHTMARES I EVER RODE BEHIND THE PARTY WHICH HAD BEEN STUDYING THE EXHIBITS IN THE DISTILLERY GOT THE IDEA IN HIS HEAD THAT MY FOOT WAS THE LOUD PEDAL ON A PIANO AND HE STARTED TO PLAY THE OVERTURE FROM WILLIAM TELL UNTIL I YELLED
4807-26853-0045 THEN I JUMPED OFF AND SWORE OFF AND SWORE AT AND WALKED HOME IF THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE IDEA OF STANDING UP BETWEEN THE SEATS IN A SARDINE CAR IS ALIVE HE SHOULD HAVE A MONUMENT
