2288-139949-0000 ARRANGING LONG LOCKED DRAWERS AND SHELVES OF CABINETS SHUT UP FOR YEARS WHAT A STRANGE TASK WE'VE SET OURSELVES HOW STILL THE LONELY ROOM APPEARS HOW STRANGE THIS MASS OF ANCIENT TREASURES
2288-139949-0001 MEMENTOS OF PAST PAINS AND PLEASURES THESE VOLUMES CLASPED WITH COSTLY STONE WITH PRINT ALL FADED GILDING GONE THESE FANS OF LEAVES FROM INDIAN TREES
2288-139949-0002 THESE CRIMSON SHELLS FROM INDIAN SEAS THESE TINY PORTRAITS SET IN RINGS ONCE DOUBTLESS DEEMED SUCH PRECIOUS THINGS KEEPSAKES BESTOWED BY LOVE ON FAITH
2288-139949-0003 AND WORN TILL THE RECEIVER'S DEATH NOW STORED WITH CAMEOS CHINA SHELLS IN THIS OLD CLOSET'S DUSTY CELLS I SCARCELY THINK FOR TEN LONG YEARS A HAND HAS TOUCHED THESE RELICS OLD
2288-139949-0004 AND COATING EACH SLOW FORMED APPEARS THE GROWTH OF GREEN AND ANTIQUE MOULD ALL IN THIS HOUSE IS MOSSING OVER ALL IS UNUSED AND DIM AND DAMP NOR LIGHT NOR WARMTH
2288-139949-0005 THE ROOMS DISCOVER BEREFT FOR YEARS OF FIRE AND LAMP THE SUN SOMETIMES IN SUMMER ENTERS THE CASEMENTS WITH REVIVING RAY BUT THE LONG RAINS OF MANY WINTERS
2288-139949-0006 THE DAW AND STARLING NESTLE WHERE THE TALL TURRET RISES HIGH AND WINDS ALONE COME NEAR TO RUSTLE THE THICK LEAVES WHERE THEIR CRADLES LIE I SOMETIMES THINK WHEN LATE AT EVEN
2288-139949-0007 I CLIMB THE STAIR RELUCTANTLY SOME SHAPE THAT SHOULD BE WELL IN HEAVEN OR ILL ELSEWHERE WILL PASS BY ME I FEAR TO SEE THE VERY FACES FAMILIAR THIRTY YEARS AGO EVEN IN THE OLD ACCUSTOMED PLACES
2288-139949-0008 WHICH LOOK SO COLD AND GLOOMY NOW I'VE COME TO CLOSE THE WINDOW HITHER AT TWILIGHT WHEN THE SUN WAS DOWN AND FEAR MY VERY SOUL WOULD WITHER LEST SOMETHING SHOULD BE DIMLY SHOWN
2288-139949-0009 TOO MUCH THE BURIED FORM RESEMBLING OF HER WHO ONCE WAS MISTRESS HERE LEST DOUBTFUL SHADE OR MOONBEAM TREMBLING MIGHT TAKE HER ASPECT ONCE SO DEAR HERS WAS THIS CHAMBER
2288-139949-0010 IN HER TIME IT SEEMED TO ME A PLEASANT ROOM FOR THEN NO CLOUD OF GRIEF OR CRIME HAD CURSED IT WITH A SETTLED GLOOM
2288-139949-0011 IN SHROUD AND SHEET ON YONDER BED BEFORE SHE MARRIED SHE WAS BLEST BLEST IN HER YOUTH BLEST IN HER WORTH HER MIND WAS CALM ITS SUNNY REST SHONE IN HER EYES MORE CLEAR THAN MIRTH
2288-139949-0012 AND WHEN ATTIRED IN RICH ARRAY LIGHT LUSTROUS HAIR ABOUT HER BROW SHE YONDER SAT A KIND OF DAY LIT UP WHAT SEEMS SO GLOOMY NOW THESE GRIM OAK WALLS
2288-139949-0013 EVEN THEN WERE GRIM THAT OLD CARVED CHAIR WAS THEN ANTIQUE BUT WHAT AROUND LOOKED DUSK AND DIM SERVED AS A FOIL TO HER FRESH CHEEK HER NECK AND ARMS OF HUE SO FAIR
2288-139949-0014 EYES OF UNCLOUDED SMILING LIGHT HER SOFT AND CURLED AND FLOATING HAIR GEMS AND ATTIRE AS RAINBOW BRIGHT RECLINED IN YONDER DEEP RECESS
2288-139949-0015 WATCHING THE SUN SHE SEEMED TO BLESS WITH HAPPY GLANCE THE GLORIOUS SKY SHE LOVED SUCH SCENES AND AS SHE GAZED HER FACE EVINCED HER SPIRIT'S MOOD BEAUTY OR GRANDEUR EVER RAISED IN HER A DEEP FELT GRATITUDE
2288-139949-0016 BUT OF ALL LOVELY THINGS SHE LOVED A CLOUDLESS MOON ON SUMMER NIGHT FULL OFT HAVE I IMPATIENCE PROVED TO SEE HOW LONG HER STILL DELIGHT WOULD FIND A THEME IN REVERIE OUT ON THE LAWN
2288-139949-0017 OR WHERE THE TREES LET IN THE LUSTRE FITFULLY AS THEIR BOUGHS PARTED MOMENTLY TO THE SOFT LANGUID SUMMER BREEZE ALAS THAT SHE SHOULD E'ER HAVE
2288-139949-0018 DECEIVED BY FALSE AND GUILEFUL TONGUE SHE GAVE HER HAND THEN SUFFERED WRONG OPPRESSED ILL USED SHE FADED YOUNG AND DIED OF GRIEF BY SLOW DECAY OPEN THAT CASKET
2288-139949-0019 SHE GREW UNCHERISHED LEARNT UNTAUGHT TO HER THE INWARD LIFE OF THOUGHT FULL SOON WAS OPEN LAID I KNOW NOT IF HER FRIENDLESSNESS DID SOMETIMES ON HER SPIRIT PRESS BUT PLAINT SHE NEVER MADE
2288-139949-0020 THE BOOK SHELVES WERE HER DARLING TREASURE SHE RARELY SEEMED THE TIME TO MEASURE WHILE SHE COULD READ ALONE AND SHE TOO LOVED THE TWILIGHT WOOD AND OFTEN IN HER MOTHER'S MOOD AWAY TO YONDER HILL WOULD HIE
2288-139949-0021 LIKE HER TO WATCH THE SETTING SUN OR SEE THE STARS BORN ONE BY ONE OUT OF THE DARKENING SKY NOR WOULD SHE LEAVE THAT HILL TILL NIGHT TREMBLED FROM POLE TO POLE WITH LIGHT EVEN THEN UPON HER HOMEWARD WAY
2288-139949-0022 LONG LONG HER WANDERING STEPS DELAYED TO QUIT THE SOMBRE FOREST SHADE THROUGH WHICH HER EERIE PATHWAY LAY YOU ASK IF SHE HAD BEAUTY'S GRACE I KNOW NOT
2288-139949-0023 A KEEN AND FINE INTELLIGENCE AND BETTER STILL THE TRUEST SENSE WERE IN HER SPEAKING MIEN BUT BLOOM OR LUSTRE WAS THERE NONE ONLY AT MOMENTS FITFUL SHONE
2288-139949-0024 WAS IN HER WORDS DISPLAYED SHE STILL BEGAN WITH QUIET SENSE BUT OFT THE FORCE OF ELOQUENCE CAME TO HER LIPS IN AID LANGUAGE AND VOICE UNCONSCIOUS CHANGED AND THOUGHTS IN OTHER WORDS ARRANGED
2288-139949-0025 HER FERVID SOUL TRANSFUSED INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO HEARD AND TRANSIENT STRENGTH AND ARDOUR STIRRED IN MINDS TO STRENGTH UNUSED YET IN GAY CROWD OR FESTAL GLARE GRAVE AND RETIRING WAS HER AIR
2288-139949-0026 TWAS SELDOM SAVE WITH ME ALONE THAT FIRE OF FEELING FREELY SHONE
2288-139949-0027 NOR WONDER'S GAZE NOR EVEN EXAGGERATED PRAISE NOR EVEN NOTICE IF TOO KEEN THE CURIOUS GAZER SEARCHED HER MIEN NATURE'S OWN GREEN EXPANSE REVEALED THE WORLD THE PLEASURES SHE COULD PRIZE
2288-139949-0028 ON FREE HILL SIDE IN SUNNY FIELD IN QUIET SPOTS BY WOODS CONCEALED
2288-139949-0029 YET NATURE'S FEELINGS DEEPLY LAY IN THAT ENDOWED AND YOUTHFUL FRAME SHRINED IN HER HEART AND HID FROM DAY THEY BURNED UNSEEN WITH SILENT FLAME IN YOUTH'S FIRST SEARCH FOR MENTAL LIGHT
2288-139949-0030 BE CALM IN FRENZY SMILE AT PAIN PALE WITH THE SECRET WAR OF FEELING SUSTAINED WITH COURAGE MUTE YET HIGH THE WOUNDS AT WHICH SHE BLED REVEALING ONLY BY ALTERED CHEEK AND EYE
2288-139949-0031 SHE BORE IN SILENCE BUT WHEN PASSION SURGED IN HER SOUL WITH CEASELESS FOAM THE STORM AT LAST BROUGHT DESOLATION AND DROVE HER EXILED FROM HER HOME AND SILENT STILL SHE STRAIGHT ASSEMBLED
2288-139949-0032 THE WRECKS OF STRENGTH HER SOUL RETAINED FOR THOUGH THE WASTED BODY TREMBLED THE UNCONQUERED MIND TO QUAIL DISDAINED SHE CROSSED THE SEA NOW LONE SHE WANDERS
2288-139949-0033 THOUGH DIMMED SO LONG WITH SECRET PAIN SHE WILL RETURN BUT COLD AND ALTERED LIKE ALL WHOSE HOPES TOO SOON DEPART LIKE ALL ON WHOM HAVE BEAT UNSHELTERED
2288-139949-0034 THE BITTER BLASTS THAT BLIGHT THE HEART NO MORE SHALL I BEHOLD HER LYING CALM ON A PILLOW SMOOTHED BY ME NO MORE THAT SPIRIT WORN WITH SIGHING
2288-139949-0035 WILL KNOW THE REST OF INFANCY IF STILL THE PATHS OF LORE SHE FOLLOW TWILL BE WITH TIRED AND GOADED WILL SHE'LL ONLY TOIL THE ACHING HOLLOW THE JOYLESS BLANK OF LIFE TO FILL
2288-139949-0036 AND OH FULL OFT QUITE SPENT AND WEARY HER HAND WILL PAUSE HER HEAD DECLINE THAT LABOUR SEEMS SO HARD AND DREARY ON WHICH NO RAY OF HOPE MAY SHINE
2288-139949-0037 THUS THE PALE BLIGHT OF TIME AND SORROW WILL SHADE WITH GREY HER SOFT DARK HAIR THEN COMES THE DAY THAT KNOWS NO MORROW AND DEATH SUCCEEDS TO LONG DESPAIR
2288-139949-0038 SO SPEAKS EXPERIENCE SAGE AND HOARY I SEE IT PLAINLY KNOW IT WELL LIKE ONE WHO HAVING READ A STORY EACH INCIDENT THEREIN CAN TELL
2288-139949-0039 TOUCH NOT THAT RING TWAS HIS THE SIRE OF THAT FORSAKEN CHILD AND NOUGHT HIS RELICS CAN INSPIRE SAVE MEMORIES SIN DEFILED I WHO SAT BY HIS WIFE'S DEATH BED I
2288-139949-0040 WHO HIS DAUGHTER LOVED COULD ALMOST CURSE THE GUILTY DEAD FOR WOES THE GUILTLESS PROVED AND HEAVEN DID CURSE THEY FOUND HIM LAID WHEN CRIME FOR WRATH WAS RIFE COLD
2288-139949-0041 AND LOPPED HIS DESPERATE DAYS YOU KNOW THE SPOT WHERE THREE BLACK TREES LIFT UP THEIR BRANCHES FELL AND MOANING CEASELESS AS THE SEAS STILL SEEM IN EVERY PASSING BREEZE THE DEED OF BLOOD TO TELL
2288-139949-0042 THEY NAMED HIM MAD AND LAID HIS BONES WHERE HOLIER ASHES LIE YET DOUBT NOT THAT HIS SPIRIT GROANS IN HELL'S ETERNITY BUT LO
2288-139949-0043 INFECTS OUR THOUGHTS WITH GLOOM
