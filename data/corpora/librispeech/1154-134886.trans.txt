1154-134886-0000 LET ME NOW DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO A SCARCELY LESS INTERESTING AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT SUBJECT
1154-134886-0001 AGRICULTURE IS BOTH A SCIENCE AND AN ART
1154-134886-0002 THE ORIGIN OF THEIR ELEMENTS AND THE SOURCES OF THEIR NOURISHMENT FORMS ITS SCIENTIFIC BASIS
1154-134886-0003 THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THE MECHANICAL OPERATIONS OF FARMING DEPEND
1154-134886-0004 AND FOR REMOVING EVERY OBNOXIOUS INFLUENCE NO EXPERIENCE DRAWN FROM THE EXERCISE OF THE ART CAN BE OPPOSED TO TRUE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THE LATTER SHOULD INCLUDE ALL THE RESULTS OF PRACTICAL OPERATIONS
1154-134886-0005 AND ARE IN SOME INSTANCES SOLELY DERIVED THEREFROM THEORY MUST CORRESPOND WITH EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE REDUCTION OF A SERIES OF PHENOMENA TO THEIR LAST CAUSES
1154-134886-0006 A FIELD IN WHICH WE CULTIVATE THE SAME PLANT FOR SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE YEARS BECOMES BARREN FOR THAT PLANT IN A PERIOD VARYING WITH THE NATURE OF THE SOIL
1154-134886-0007 A THIRD GIVES A PLENTIFUL CROP OF TURNIPS BUT WILL NOT BEAR CLOVER WHAT IS THE REASON THAT A FIELD LOSES ITS FERTILITY FOR ONE PLANT THE SAME WHICH AT FIRST FLOURISHED THERE
1154-134886-0008 WHAT IS THE REASON ONE KIND OF PLANT SUCCEEDS IN A FIELD WHERE ANOTHER FAILS THESE QUESTIONS BELONG TO SCIENCE
1154-134886-0009 WHAT TO RENDER ONE FIELD FERTILE FOR TWO FOR THREE FOR ALL PLANTS THESE LAST QUESTIONS ARE PUT BY ART BUT THEY CANNOT BE ANSWERED BY ART IF A FARMER WITHOUT THE GUIDANCE OF JUST SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES
1154-134886-0010 IT OTHERWISE WILL NOT BEAR HIS PROSPECT OF SUCCESS IS VERY SMALL THOUSANDS OF FARMERS TRY SUCH EXPERIMENTS IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS THE RESULT OF WHICH IS A MASS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE FORMING A METHOD OF CULTIVATION
1154-134886-0011 WHICH ACCOMPLISHES THE DESIRED END FOR CERTAIN PLACES BUT THE SAME METHOD FREQUENTLY DOES NOT SUCCEED IT INDEED CEASES TO BE APPLICABLE TO A SECOND OR THIRD PLACE IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
1154-134886-0012 HOW LARGE A CAPITAL AND HOW MUCH POWER ARE WASTED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS VERY DIFFERENT AND FAR MORE SECURE IS THE PATH INDICATED BY SCIENCE IT EXPOSES US TO NO DANGER OF FAILING
1154-134886-0013 BUT ON THE CONTRARY IT FURNISHES US WITH EVERY GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS IF THE CAUSE OF FAILURE OF BARRENNESS IN THE SOIL FOR ONE OR TWO PLANTS HAS BEEN DISCOVERED
1154-134886-0014 THE MOST EXACT OBSERVATIONS PROVE THAT THE METHOD OF CULTIVATION MUST VARY WITH THE GEOGNOSTICAL CONDITION OF THE SUBSOIL
1154-134886-0015 AND THE PRESENCE OF WHICH RENDERS THEM FERTILE THIS FULLY EXPLAINS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NECESSARY METHODS OF CULTURE FOR DIFFERENT PLACES
1154-134886-0016 WHEAT CLOVER TURNIPS FOR EXAMPLE EACH REQUIRE CERTAIN ELEMENTS FROM THE SOIL THEY WILL NOT FLOURISH WHERE THE APPROPRIATE ELEMENTS ARE ABSENT
1154-134886-0017 SCIENCE TEACHES US WHAT ELEMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO EVERY SPECIES OF PLANTS BY AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR ASHES
1154-134886-0018 THE CAUSE OF ITS BARRENNESS AND ITS REMOVAL MAY NOW BE READILY ACCOMPLISHED THE EMPIRIC ATTRIBUTES ALL HIS SUCCESS TO THE MECHANICAL OPERATIONS OF AGRICULTURE
1154-134886-0019 HE EXPERIENCES AND RECOGNISES THEIR VALUE WITHOUT INQUIRING WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF THEIR UTILITY THEIR MODE OF ACTION AND YET THIS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE FOR REGULATING THE APPLICATION OF POWER
1154-134886-0020 AND THE EXPENDITURE OF CAPITAL FOR INSURING ITS ECONOMICAL EXPENDITURE AND THE PREVENTION OF WASTE CAN IT BE IMAGINED THAT THE MERE PASSING OF THE PLOUGHSHARE OR THE HARROW THROUGH THE SOIL THE MERE
1154-134886-0021 CONTACT OF THE IRON CAN IMPART FERTILITY MIRACULOUSLY NOBODY PERHAPS SERIOUSLY ENTERTAINS SUCH AN OPINION NEVERTHELESS THE MODUS OPERANDI OF THESE MECHANICAL OPERATIONS
1154-134886-0022 IS BY NO MEANS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THE FACT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT CAREFUL PLOUGHING EXERTS THE MOST FAVOURABLE INFLUENCE THE SURFACE IS THUS MECHANICALLY DIVIDED CHANGED INCREASED AND RENOVATED
1154-134886-0023 BUT THE PLOUGHING IS ONLY AUXILIARY TO THE END SOUGHT IN THE EFFECTS OF TIME IN WHAT IN AGRICULTURE ARE TECHNICALLY CALLED FALLOWS THE REPOSE OF THE FIELDS WE RECOGNISE BY SCIENCE CERTAIN CHEMICAL ACTIONS
1154-134886-0024 WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY EXERCISED BY THE ELEMENTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE UPON THE WHOLE SURFACE OF OUR GLOBE BY THE ACTION OF ITS OXYGEN AND ITS CARBONIC ACID AIDED BY WATER
1154-134886-0025 THESE CHEMICAL ACTIONS POETICALLY DENOMINATES THE TOOTH OF TIME
1154-134886-0026 BY THEIR INFLUENCE THE NECESSARY ELEMENTS OF THE SOIL BECOME FITTED FOR ASSIMILATION BY PLANTS
1154-134886-0027 THEY ACCELERATE THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE SOIL IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A NEW GENERATION OF PLANTS WITH THE NECESSARY ELEMENTS IN A CONDITION FAVOURABLE TO THEIR ASSIMILATION IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE RAPIDITY OF THE DECOMPOSITION OF A SOLID BODY
1154-134886-0028 MUST INCREASE WITH THE EXTENSION OF ITS SURFACE THE MORE POINTS OF CONTACT WE OFFER IN A GIVEN TIME TO THE EXTERNAL CHEMICAL AGENT THE MORE RAPID WILL BE ITS ACTION THE CHEMIST IN ORDER TO PREPARE A MINERAL FOR ANALYSIS
1154-134886-0029 TO DECOMPOSE IT OR TO INCREASE THE SOLUBILITY OF ITS ELEMENTS PROCEEDS IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FARMER DEALS WITH HIS FIELDS HE SPARES NO LABOUR IN ORDER TO REDUCE IT TO THE FINEST POWDER HE SEPARATES THE IMPALPABLE FROM THE COARSER PARTS BY WASHING
1154-134886-0030 AND REPEATS HIS MECHANICAL BRUISING AND TRITURATION BEING ASSURED HIS WHOLE PROCESS WILL FAIL IF HE IS INATTENTIVE TO THIS ESSENTIAL AND PRELIMINARY PART OF IT
1154-134886-0031 AND UPON THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF AIR AND MOISTURE IS STRIKINGLY ILLUSTRATED UPON A LARGE SCALE
1154-134886-0032 THESE ARE DESCRIBED IN A VERY INTERESTING MANNER BY DARWIN THE ROCK CONTAINING THE GOLD ORE IS POUNDED BY MILLS INTO THE FINEST POWDER THIS IS SUBJECTED TO WASHING WHICH SEPARATES THE LIGHTER PARTICLES FROM THE METALLIC THE GOLD SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
1154-134886-0033 WHILE A STREAM OF WATER CARRIES AWAY THE LIGHTER EARTHY PARTS INTO PONDS WHERE IT SUBSIDES TO THE BOTTOM AS MUD WHEN THIS DEPOSIT HAS GRADUALLY FILLED UP THE POND THIS MUD IS TAKEN OUT AND PILED IN HEAPS AND LEFT EXPOSED TO THE ACTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND MOISTURE
1154-134886-0034 THE WASHING COMPLETELY REMOVES ALL THE SOLUBLE PART OF THE DISINTEGRATED ROCK THE INSOLUBLE PART MOREOVER CANNOT UNDERGO ANY FURTHER CHANGE WHILE IT IS COVERED WITH WATER AND SO EXCLUDED FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POND
1154-134886-0035 BUT BEING EXPOSED AT ONCE TO THE AIR AND MOISTURE A POWERFUL CHEMICAL ACTION TAKES PLACE IN THE WHOLE MASS WHICH BECOMES INDICATED BY AN EFFLORESCENCE OF SALTS COVERING THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE HEAPS IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY
1154-134886-0036 AND A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF GOLD IS OBTAINED THIS HAVING BEEN SEPARATED BY THE CHEMICAL PROCESS OF DECOMPOSITION IN THE MASS THE EXPOSURE AND WASHING OF THE SAME MUD IS REPEATED SIX OR SEVEN TIMES
1154-134886-0037 AND WE ACCELERATE AND INCREASE IT BY THE MECHANICAL OPERATIONS OF OUR AGRICULTURE BY THESE WE SEVER AND EXTEND THE SURFACE
