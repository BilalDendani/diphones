153-126652-0001 AND BY AN INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE OF LOYALTY TOWARDS HER COUSIN CLYM TO BESTIR HERSELF ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH AN ALACRITY UNUSUAL IN HER DURING THESE MOST SORROWFUL DAYS OF HER LIFE
153-126652-0002 AT THE TIME THAT EUSTACIA WAS LISTENING TO THE RICK MAKERS CONVERSATION ON CLYM'S RETURN THOMASIN WAS CLIMBING INTO A LOFT OVER HER AUNT'S FUELHOUSE WHERE THE STORE APPLES WERE KEPT
153-126652-0003 TO SEARCH OUT THE BEST AND LARGEST OF THEM FOR THE COMING HOLIDAY TIME THE LOFT WAS LIGHTED BY A SEMICIRCULAR HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE PIGEONS CREPT TO THEIR LODGINGS IN THE SAME HIGH QUARTERS OF THE PREMISES
153-126652-0004 AND FROM THIS HOLE THE SUN SHONE IN A BRIGHT YELLOW PATCH UPON THE FIGURE OF THE MAIDEN AS SHE KNELT AND PLUNGED HER NAKED ARMS INTO THE SOFT BROWN FERN WHICH FROM ITS ABUNDANCE
153-126652-0005 WAS USED ON EGDON IN PACKING AWAY STORES OF ALL KINDS THE PIGEONS WERE FLYING ABOUT HER HEAD WITH THE GREATEST UNCONCERN AND THE FACE OF HER AUNT WAS JUST VISIBLE ABOVE THE FLOOR OF THE LOFT
153-126652-0006 LIT BY A FEW STRAY MOTES OF LIGHT AS SHE STOOD HALFWAY UP THE LADDER LOOKING AT A SPOT INTO WHICH SHE WAS NOT CLIMBER ENOUGH TO VENTURE NOW A FEW RUSSETS TAMSIN
153-126652-0007 HE USED TO LIKE THEM ALMOST AS WELL AS RIBSTONES THOMASIN TURNED AND ROLLED ASIDE THE FERN FROM ANOTHER NOOK WHERE MORE MELLOW FRUIT GREETED HER WITH ITS RIPE SMELL BEFORE PICKING THEM OUT
153-126652-0008 SHE STOPPED A MOMENT DEAR CLYM I WONDER HOW YOUR FACE LOOKS NOW SHE SAID GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE PIGEON HOLE
153-126652-0009 WHICH ADMITTED THE SUNLIGHT SO DIRECTLY UPON HER BROWN HAIR AND TRANSPARENT TISSUES THAT IT ALMOST SEEMED TO SHINE THROUGH HER IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN DEAR TO YOU IN ANOTHER WAY SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FROM THE LADDER
153-126652-0010 THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HAPPY MEETING IS THERE ANY USE IN SAYING WHAT CAN DO NO GOOD AUNT YES SAID HER AUNT WITH SOME WARMTH TO THOROUGHLY FILL THE AIR WITH THE PAST MISFORTUNE
153-126652-0011 SO THAT OTHER GIRLS MAY TAKE WARNING AND KEEP CLEAR OF IT THOMASIN LOWERED HER FACE TO THE APPLES AGAIN I AM A WARNING TO OTHERS JUST AS THIEVES AND DRUNKARDS AND GAMBLERS ARE
153-126652-0012 SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WHAT A CLASS TO BELONG TO DO I REALLY BELONG TO THEM TIS ABSURD YET WHY AUNT DOES EVERYBODY KEEP ON MAKING ME THINK THAT I DO BY THE WAY THEY BEHAVE TOWARDS ME
153-126652-0013 WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUDGE ME BY MY ACTS NOW LOOK AT ME AS I KNEEL HERE PICKING UP THESE APPLES DO I LOOK LIKE A LOST WOMAN I WISH ALL GOOD WOMEN WERE AS GOOD AS I SHE
153-126652-0014 STRANGERS DON'T SEE YOU AS I DO SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT THEY JUDGE FROM FALSE REPORT WELL IT IS A SILLY JOB AND I AM PARTLY TO BLAME HOW QUICKLY A RASH THING CAN BE DONE
153-126652-0015 REPLIED THE GIRL HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING AND TEARS SO CROWDED THEMSELVES INTO HER EYES THAT SHE COULD HARDLY DISTINGUISH APPLES FROM FERN AS SHE CONTINUED INDUSTRIOUSLY SEARCHING TO HIDE HER WEAKNESS

153-126652-0017 THOMASIN CAME DOWN WHEN THE APPLES WERE COLLECTED AND TOGETHER THEY WENT THROUGH THE WHITE PALINGS TO THE HEATH BEYOND THE OPEN HILLS WERE AIRY AND CLEAR AND THE REMOTE ATMOSPHERE APPEARED
153-126652-0018 AS IT OFTEN APPEARS ON A FINE WINTER DAY IN DISTINCT PLANES OF ILLUMINATION INDEPENDENTLY TONED THE RAYS WHICH LIT THE NEARER TRACTS OF LANDSCAPE
153-126652-0019 A STRATUM OF ENSAFFRONED LIGHT WAS IMPOSED ON A STRATUM OF DEEP BLUE AND BEHIND THESE LAY STILL REMOTER SCENES WRAPPED IN FRIGID GREY
153-126652-0020 THEY REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE HOLLIES GREW WHICH WAS IN A CONICAL PIT SO THAT THE TOPS OF THE TREES WERE NOT MUCH ABOVE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF THE GROUND THOMASIN STEPPED UP INTO A FORK OF ONE OF THE BUSHES
153-126652-0021 AS SHE HAD DONE UNDER HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ON MANY SIMILAR OCCASIONS AND WITH A SMALL CHOPPER THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT SHE BEGAN TO LOP OFF THE HEAVILY BERRIED BOUGHS DON'T SCRATCH YOUR FACE
153-126652-0022 SAID HER AUNT WHO STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE PIT
153-126652-0023 WILL YOU WALK WITH ME TO MEET HIM THIS EVENING I SHOULD LIKE TO ELSE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN HIM SAID THOMASIN TOSSING OUT A BOUGH NOT THAT THAT WOULD MATTER MUCH

153-126652-0026 ANY MORE THAN I AM AN IMPROPER WOMAN HE HAS AN UNFORTUNATE MANNER AND DOESN'T TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE HIM IF THEY DON'T WISH TO DO IT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOMASIN
153-126652-0027 SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT QUIETLY FIXING HER EYE UPON HER NIECE
153-126652-0028 HOW DO YOU MEAN I HAVE LONG HAD A SUSPICION THAT YOUR LOVE FOR HIM HAS CHANGED ITS COLOUR

153-126652-0034 IT IS THE ONLY WAY OUT OF A FALSE POSITION AND A VERY GALLING ONE WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM THAT HE WAS STANDING IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER LOVER OF YOURS AUNT

153-126652-0042 AND THAT I DID NOT EXPECT HIM HOME SO SOON AND YOU MUST NOT LET ME STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR CHRISTMAS PARTY PUTTING IT OFF WOULD ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE OF COURSE I SHALL NOT I DO NOT WISH TO SHOW MYSELF BEATEN BEFORE ALL EGDON
153-126652-0043 THOMASIN CAME OUT OF THE TREE SHOOK FROM HER HAIR AND DRESS THE LOOSE BERRIES WHICH HAD FALLEN THEREON AND WENT DOWN THE HILL WITH HER AUNT EACH WOMAN BEARING HALF THE GATHERED BOUGHS
