4967-28868-0000 AND HE WAS LEAVING HER WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO THE SCENE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE WHEN AN IDEA STRUCK HIM THAT THIS WOULD BE CRUEL MARY HE SAID I WAS VERY SORRY FOR ALL THAT IT WAS NOT MY DOING
4967-28868-0001 IF YOU MEAN BY CONTROLLING MYSELF HOLDING MY TONGUE HE IS THE MAN I LOVE WHOM I HAVE PROMISED TO MARRY BUT MARY DO LADIES GENERALLY EMBRACE THEIR LOVERS IN PUBLIC NO NOR SHOULD I
4967-28868-0002 I NEVER DID SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE BEFORE BUT AS HE WAS THERE I HAD TO SHOW THAT I WAS NOT ASHAMED OF HIM
4967-28868-0003 IF YOU ALL HAD NOT BEEN THERE THEN AGAIN SHE BURST INTO TEARS HE DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
4967-28868-0004 BUT YET AS HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN HE SHUDDERED WITH VEXATION I WAS THINKING OF THE GOVERNOR HE SAID HE SHALL BE TOLD EVERYTHING THAT YOU MET TREGEAR CERTAINLY AND THAT I KISSED HIM
4967-28868-0005 I WILL DO NOTHING THAT I AM ASHAMED TO TELL EVERYBODY HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY I CANNOT HELP IT HE SHOULD NOT TREAT ME AS HE IS DOING MISTER TREGEAR IS A GENTLEMAN WHY DID HE LET HIM COME WHY DID YOU BRING HIM
4967-28868-0006 BUT IT IS OF NO USE THE THING IS SETTLED PAPA CAN BREAK MY HEART
4967-28868-0007 ON THAT NIGHT MARY TOLD THE WHOLE OF HER STORY TO LADY CANTRIP THERE WAS NOTHING THAT SHE TRIED TO CONCEAL I GOT UP SHE SAID AND THREW MY ARMS ROUND HIM IS HE NOT ALL THE WORLD TO ME
4967-28868-0008 NOW I WANT YOU TO TELL PAPA ALL ABOUT IT LADY CANTRIP BEGAN TO THINK THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EVIL DAY FOR HER WHEN SHE HAD AGREED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIS VERY DETERMINED YOUNG LADY BUT SHE CONSENTED AT ONCE TO WRITE TO THE DUKE
4967-28868-0009 I WOULD RATHER YOU WROTE THE LETTER SAID LADY MARY BUT PRAY TELL HIM THAT ALL ALONG I HAVE MEANT HIM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT TILL LADY CANTRIP SEATED HERSELF AT HER WRITING TABLE
4967-28868-0010 BUT THE DUKE'S CHARACTER ADDED MUCH TO THE SEVERITY OF THE TASK AND THEN THAT EMBRACE SHE KNEW THAT THE DUKE WOULD BE STRUCK WITH HORROR AS HE READ OF SUCH A TALE AND SHE FOUND HERSELF ALMOST STRUCK WITH HORROR AS SHE ATTEMPTED TO WRITE IT
4967-28868-0011 WHEN SHE CAME TO THE POINT SHE FOUND SHE COULD NOT WRITE IT I FEAR THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF WARMTH SHOWN ON BOTH SIDES SHE SAID FEELING THAT SHE WAS CALUMNIATING THE MAN AS TO WHOSE WARMTH SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING
4967-28868-0012 IT IS QUITE CLEAR SHE ADDED THAT THIS IS NOT A PASSING FANCY ON HER PART
4967-28868-0013 THAT SILVERBRIDGE HAD TAKEN MARY HE DID UNDERSTAND AND THAT THEY HAD TOGETHER GONE TO LORD GREX'S HOUSE HE UNDERSTOOD ALSO THAT THE MEETING HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE PRESENCE OF SILVERBRIDGE AND OF LADY MABEL NO DOUBT IT WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT
4967-28868-0014 LADY CANTRIP WROTE HOW COULD IT BE AN ACCIDENT YOU HAD MARY UP IN TOWN ON FRIDAY
4967-28868-0015 IT WAS SIMPLY AN ACCIDENT SUCH AN ACCIDENT AS MUST OCCUR OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNLESS MARY IS TO BE LOCKED UP WHO TALKS OF LOCKING ANYBODY UP WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO SPEAK IN THAT WAY
4967-28868-0016 I ONLY MEANT THAT OF COURSE THEY WILL STUMBLE ACROSS EACH OTHER IN LONDON I THINK I WILL GO ABROAD SAID THE DUKE HE WAS SILENT FOR AWHILE AND THEN REPEATED HIS WORDS I THINK I WILL GO ABROAD NOT FOR LONG I HOPE SIR
4967-28868-0017 I KNEW HE HAD A FEW HORSES THERE IT IS NOT THE MONEY BUT THE ABSENCE OF PRINCIPLE THAT A YOUNG MAN SHOULD HAVE NO FEELING THAT HE OUGHT TO LIVE WITHIN CERTAIN PRESCRIBED MEANS
4967-28868-0018 NOT EXACTLY SIR IT IS DIFFERENT WITH YOU BUT A MAN LET HIM BE WHO HE MAY SHOULD LIVE WITHIN CERTAIN MEANS AS FOR YOUR SISTER I THINK SHE WILL BREAK MY HEART
4967-28868-0019 SILVERBRIDGE FOUND IT TO BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY ANYTHING IN ANSWER TO THIS ARE YOU GOING TO CHURCH ASKED THE DUKE I WAS NOT THINKING OF DOING SO PARTICULARLY DO YOU NOT EVER GO
4967-28868-0020 FOR IT WAS I FEAR IN THAT WAY THAT HE HAD LOOKED AT IT DID NOT SEE ANY REASON FOR PERFORMING A DUTY WHICH HIS FATHER HIMSELF OMITTED AND THERE WERE VARIOUS MATTERS ALSO WHICH HARASSED HIM ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AFTER DINNER
4967-28868-0021 HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BACK THE PRIME MINISTER FOR THE LEGER TO A VERY SERIOUS AMOUNT
4967-28868-0022 AND NOW STOOD TO LOSE SOME TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS ON THE DOINGS OF THE LAST NIGHT AND HE HAD MADE THESE BETS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MAJOR TIFTO
4967-28868-0023 HE HAD SO COMMITTED HIMSELF THAT THE OFFER MUST NOW BE MADE HE DID NOT SPECIALLY REGRET THAT THOUGH HE WISHED THAT HE HAD BEEN MORE RETICENT WHAT A FOOL A MAN IS TO BLURT OUT EVERYTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF A WIFE WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR HIM
4967-28868-0024 AND WHERE COULD HE POSSIBLY FIND A BETTER WIFE THAN MABEL GREX IN BEAUTY SHE WAS NO DOUBT INFERIOR TO MISS BONCASSEN THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT MISS BONCASSEN WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGET HER BUT MISS BONCASSEN WAS AN AMERICAN AND ON MANY ACCOUNTS OUT OF THE QUESTION
4967-28868-0025 BUT STILL IT SEEMED HARD TO HIM THAT THIS INTENTION OF MARRIAGE SHOULD STAND IN HIS WAY OF HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH MISS BONCASSEN FOR A FEW WEEKS NO DOUBT THERE WERE OBJECTIONS TO MARRIAGE IT CLIPPED A FELLOW'S WINGS BUT THEN IF HE WERE MARRIED
4967-28868-0026 HE MIGHT BE SURE THAT TIFTO WOULD BE LAID ASIDE
4967-28868-0027 IT MEANT COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE IN MONEY MATTERS THEN HIS MIND RAN AWAY TO A REVIEW OF HIS FATHER'S AFFAIRS IT WAS A GENUINE TROUBLE TO HIM THAT HIS FATHER SHOULD BE SO UNHAPPY OF ALL THE GRIEFS WHICH WEIGHED UPON THE DUKE'S MIND
4967-28868-0028 THE MONEY WHICH GERALD OWED AT CAMBRIDGE WOULD BE NOTHING IF THAT OTHER SORROW COULD BE CONQUERED
4967-28868-0029 IF TREGEAR COULD BE GOT OUT OF THE WAY HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE RECONCILED TO OTHER THINGS HE FELT VERY TENDER HEARTED ABOUT HIS FATHER
4967-28868-0030 BUT OF WHOM YOU WOULD SAY AFTER DUE OBSERVATION THAT HE HAD NOT AS YET PUT OFF ALL HIS CHILDISH WAYS HE NOW SAT WITH HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT WITH HIS CANE IN HIS HANDS
4967-28868-0031 WITH ALL MY HEART SAID TREGEAR SIT DOWN HERE SAID SILVERBRIDGE
4967-28868-0032 THAT WAS KIND AND I WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO YOU ALL THIS ABOUT MY SISTER MUST BE GIVEN UP MUST BE GIVEN UP IT CAN NEVER LEAD TO ANY GOOD I MEAN THAT THERE NEVER CAN BE A MARRIAGE THEN HE PAUSED
4967-28868-0033 BUT TREGEAR WAS DETERMINED TO HEAR HIM OUT IT IS MAKING MY FATHER SO MISERABLE THAT YOU WOULD PITY HIM IF YOU COULD SEE HIM I DARE SAY I SHOULD WHEN I SEE PEOPLE UNHAPPY I ALWAYS PITY THEM WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK OF IS THIS
4967-28868-0034 YOU ARE QUITE AT LIBERTY TO TELL HIM THAT I SAY SO I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK YOUR FATHER FOR A PENNY AND I WILL NEVER DO SO THE POWER IS ALL IN HIS HANDS AS FAR AS I KNOW MY OWN PURPOSES I SHALL NOT MAKE ANY IMMEDIATE ATTEMPT EVEN TO SEE HER
4967-28868-0035 WE DID MEET AS YOU SAW THE OTHER DAY BY THE MEREST CHANCE AFTER THAT DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR SISTER WISHES ME TO GIVE HER UP AS FOR SUPPOSING THAT GIRLS ARE TO HAVE WHAT THEY WISH THAT IS NONSENSE
4967-28868-0036 FOR YOUNG MEN I SUPPOSE EQUALLY SO LIFE OUGHT TO BE A LIFE OF SELF DENIAL NO DOUBT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MY DUTY TO RETIRE FROM THIS AFFAIR IF BY DOING SO I SHOULD SACRIFICE ONLY MYSELF
4967-28868-0037 I THINK I PERHAPS MIGHT EXPRESS SUCH AN OPINION WELL THEN I HAVE TO EXAMINE MYSELF AND FIND OUT WHETHER I AM GUILTY OF THE MEANNESS WHICH I MIGHT PERHAPS BE TOO READY TO IMPUTE TO ANOTHER I HAVE DONE SO
