4059-3069-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THE BARON ARRIVES IN ENGLAND THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES COMES TO CONGRATULATE HIM GREAT REJOICINGS ON THE BARON'S RETURN AND A TREMENDOUS CONCERT THE BARON'S DISCOURSE WITH FRAGRANTIA AND HER OPINION OF THE TOUR TO THE HEBRIDES
4059-3069-0001 HAVING ARRIVED IN ENGLAND ONCE MORE THE GREATEST REJOICINGS WERE MADE FOR MY RETURN THE WHOLE CITY SEEMED ONE GENERAL BLAZE OF ILLUMINATION AND THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES HEARING OF MY ASTONISHING FEATS
4059-3069-0002 CAME ON PURPOSE TO ENGLAND TO CONGRATULATE ME ON SUCH UNPARALLELED ACHIEVEMENTS BUT ABOVE ALL OTHER REJOICINGS ON MY RETURN THE MUSICAL ORATORIO AND SONG OF TRIUMPH WERE MAGNIFICENT IN THE EXTREME
4059-3069-0003 GOG AND MAGOG WERE ORDERED TO TAKE THE MAIDEN TOWER OF WINDSOR AND MAKE A TAMBOURINE OR GREAT DRUM OF IT FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY EXTENDED AN ELEPHANT'S HIDE TANNED AND PREPARED FOR THE DESIGN
4059-3069-0004 ACROSS THE SUMMIT OF THE TOWER FROM PARAPET TO PARAPET SO THAT IN PROPORTION THIS EXTENDED ELEPHANT'S HIDE WAS TO THE WHOLE OF THE CASTLE WHAT THE PARCHMENT IS TO A DRUM
4059-3069-0005 IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE WHOLE BECAME ONE GREAT INSTRUMENT OF WAR TO CORRESPOND WITH THIS COLOSSUS TOOK GUILDHALL AND WESTMINSTER ABBEY AND TURNING THE FOUNDATIONS TOWARDS THE HEAVENS
4059-3069-0006 SO THAT THE ROOFS OF THE EDIFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND HE STRUNG THEM ACROSS WITH BRASS AND STEEL WIRE FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND THUS WHEN STRUNG THEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF MOST NOBLE DULCIMERS HE THEN TOOK THE GREAT DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S
4059-3069-0007 RAISING IT OFF THE EARTH WITH AS MUCH FACILITY AS YOU WOULD A DECANTER OF CLARET AND WHEN ONCE RISEN UP IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A QUART BOTTLE COLOSSUS INSTANTLY WITH HIS TEETH CRACKED OFF THE SUPERIOR PART OF THE CUPOLA
4059-3069-0008 AND THEN APPLYING HIS LIPS TO THE INSTRUMENT BEGAN TO SOUND IT LIKE A TRUMPET TWAS MARTIAL BEYOND DESCRIPTION
4059-3069-0009 DURING THE CONCERT I WALKED IN THE PARK WITH LADY FRAGRANTIA
4059-3069-0010 I LIKE SAID SHE THE DEW OF THE MORNING TIS DELICATE AND ETHEREAL AND BY THUS BESPANGLING ME I THINK IT WILL MORE APPROXIMATE ME TO THE NATURE OF THE ROSE FOR HER LOOKS WERE LIKE AURORA AND TO CONFIRM THE VERMILION I SHALL GO TO SPA
4059-3069-0011 AND DRINK THE PODHON SPRING ADDED I GAZING AT HER FROM TOP TO TOE YES REPLIED THE LOVELY FRAGRANTIA WITH ALL MY HEART TIS THE DRINK OF SWEETNESS AND DELICACY NEVER WERE THERE ANY CREATURES LIKE THE WATER DRINKERS AT SPA
4059-3069-0012 THEY SEEM LIKE SO MANY THIRSTY BLOSSOMS ON A PEACH TREE THAT SUCK UP THE SHOWER IN THE SCORCHING HEAT THERE IS A CERTAIN SOMETHING IN THE WATERS THAT GIVES VIGOUR TO THE WHOLE FRAME AND EXPANDS EVERY HEART WITH RAPTURE AND BENEVOLENCE
4059-3069-0013 AND THEN HOW THEY SLEEP PRAY MY DEAR BARON WERE YOU EVER AT THE FALLS OF NIAGARA YES MY LADY REPLIED I SURPRISED AT SUCH A STRANGE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS
4059-3069-0014 AT THAT MOMENT SHE DROPPED HER NOSEGAY AH
4059-3069-0015 THERE IS NO GREAT VARIETY IN THESE POLYANTHUSES I DO ASSURE YOU MY DEAR BARON THAT THERE IS TASTE IN THE SELECTION OF FLOWERS AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE AND WERE I A GIRL OF SIXTEEN I SHOULD WEAR SOME ROSEBUDS IN MY BOSOM
4059-3069-0016 QUITE RIPE AND READY TO DROP OFF THE STALK FOR WANT OF BEING PULLED HEIGH HO BUT PRAY MY LADY SAID I HOW DO YOU LIKE THE CONCERT ALAS SAID SHE LANGUISHINGLY WHILE SHE LAID HER HAND UPON MY SHOULDER
4059-3069-0017 WHAT ARE THESE BODILESS SOUNDS AND VIBRATION TO ME AND YET WHAT AN EXQUISITE SWEETNESS IN THE SONGS OF THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR ISLAND
4059-3069-0018 HOW PATHETIC AND DIVINE THE LITTLE AIRS OF SCOTLAND AND THE HEBRIDES
4059-3069-0019 BUT I HAVE AN IDEA OF A GREAT BROWN FULL BOTTOMED WIG AND A HOGSHEAD OF PORTER OH TWAS BASE TO BE TREATED EVERYWHERE WITH POLITENESS AND HOSPITALITY AND IN RETURN INVIDIOUSLY TO SMELLFUNGUS THEM ALL OVER
4059-3069-0020 TO GO TO THE COUNTRY OF KATE OF ABERDEEN OF AULD ROBIN GRAY MIDST RURAL INNOCENCE AND SWEETNESS TAKE UP THEIR PLAIDS AND DANCE OH DOCTOR DOCTOR
4059-3069-0021 PEACE TO THE HEROES REPLIED SHE IN A DELICATE AND THEATRICAL TONE
4059-3069-0022 THE SONS OF THE WAVE AND THE CHIEFS OF THE DARK BROWN SHIELD THE TEAR OF THE SYMPATHISING STRANGER IS SCATTERED BY THE WIND OVER THE HOARY STONES AS SHE MEDITATES SORROWFULLY ON THE TIMES OF OLD
