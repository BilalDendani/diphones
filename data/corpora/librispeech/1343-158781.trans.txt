1343-158781-0000 ON THEIR JOURNEY BACK TO PORTRAY THE LADIES WERE ALMOST TOO TIRED FOR TALKING AND SIR GRIFFIN WAS SULKY SIR GRIFFIN HAD AS YET HEARD NOTHING ABOUT GREYSTOCK'S ADVENTURE AND DID NOT CARE TO BE TOLD
1343-158781-0001 HER MARRIAGE WITH SIR FLORIAN HAD BEEN TRIUMPHANT BUT THAT WAS ONLY A STEP TO SOMETHING GOOD THAT WAS TO COME AFTER SHE THEN HAD AT HER OWN DISPOSAL HER LITTLE WITS AND HER PRETTINESS
1343-158781-0002 AND A WORLD BEFORE HER IN WHICH AS IT THEN SEEMED TO HER THERE WAS A DEAL OF PLEASURE IF SHE COULD ONLY REACH IT UP TO THIS PERIOD OF HER CAREER SHE HAD HARDLY REACHED ANY PLEASURE BUT THIS DAY HAD BEEN VERY PLEASANT
1343-158781-0003 AND THEN TO SEE LUCINDA FALL INTO IT AND SHE COULD REMEMBER EVERY JUMP AND HER FEELING OF ECSTASY AS SHE LANDED ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND SHE HAD BY HEART EVERY KIND WORD THAT LORD GEORGE HAD SAID TO HER
1343-158781-0004 AND SHE LOVED THE SWEET PLEASANT CORSAIR LIKE INTIMACY THAT HAD SPRUNG UP BETWEEN THEM SHE WONDERED WHETHER FRANK WAS AT ALL JEALOUS IT WOULDN'T BE AMISS THAT HE SHOULD BE A LITTLE JEALOUS
1343-158781-0005 AND THEN SOMEBODY HAD BROUGHT HOME IN HIS POCKET THE FOX'S BRUSH WHICH THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS HAD TOLD THE HUNTSMAN TO GIVE HER IT WAS ALL DELIGHTFUL AND SO MUCH MORE DELIGHTFUL BECAUSE MISSUS CARBUNCLE
1343-158781-0006 HAD NOT GONE QUITE SO WELL AS SHE LIKED TO GO AND BECAUSE LUCINDA HAD FALLEN INTO THE WATER THEY DID NOT DINE TILL PAST EIGHT AND THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ALL LEFT THE ROOM TOGETHER
1343-158781-0007 COFFEE AND LIQUEURS WERE TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND THEY WERE ALL TO BE INTIMATE COMFORTABLE AND AT THEIR EASE ALL EXCEPT SIR GRIFFIN TEWETT WHO WAS STILL VERY SULKY DID HE SAY ANYTHING
1343-158781-0008 MISSUS CARBUNCLE HAD ASKED YES WELL HE PROPOSED BUT OF COURSE I COULD NOT ANSWER HIM WHEN I WAS WET THROUGH
1343-158781-0009 THERE HAD BEEN BUT A MOMENT AND IN THAT MOMENT THIS WAS ALL THAT LUCINDA WOULD SAY NOW I DON'T MEAN TO STIR AGAIN SAID LIZZIE THROWING HERSELF INTO A CORNER OF A SOFA
1343-158781-0010 TILL SOMEBODY CARRIES ME TO BED I NEVER WAS SO TIRED IN ALL MY LIFE SHE WAS TIRED BUT THERE IS A FATIGUE WHICH IS DELIGHTFUL AS LONG AS ALL THE SURROUNDINGS ARE PLEASANT AND COMFORTABLE
1343-158781-0011 I DIDN'T CALL IT A VERY HARD DAY SAID MISSUS CARBUNCLE YOU ONLY KILLED ONE FOX SAID MISTER EMILIUS PRETENDING A DELIGHTFULLY CLERICAL IGNORANCE
1343-158781-0012 AND ON MONDAY YOU KILLED FOUR WHY SHOULD YOU BE TIRED I SUPPOSE IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY MILES SAID FRANK WHO WAS ALSO IGNORANT ABOUT TEN PERHAPS SAID LORD GEORGE
1343-158781-0013 IT WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES AND THERE WAS A GOOD BIT OF SLOW HUNTING AFTER WE HAD COME BACK OVER THE RIVER I'M SURE IT WAS THIRTY SAID LIZZIE FORGETTING HER FATIGUE IN HER ENERGY
1343-158781-0014 TEN IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN TWENTY SAID LORD GEORGE AND FIVE GENERALLY BETTER THAN TEN IT WAS JUST WHATEVER IS BEST SAID LIZZIE
1343-158781-0015 BUT YOU SEE HE TOOK IT OUT IN CALLING YOUR COUSIN MISTER GREYSTOCKINGS I FELT THAT BLOW SAID FRANK I SHALL ALWAYS CALL YOU COUSIN GREYSTOCKINGS SAID LIZZIE IT WAS HARD
1343-158781-0016 CONTINUED LORD GEORGE AND I UNDERSTOOD IT ALL SO WELL WHEN HE GOT INTO A MESS IN HIS WRATH ABOUT BOOKING THE HORSE TO KILMARNOCK IF THE HORSE HAD BEEN ON THE ROADSIDE HE OR HIS MEN COULD HAVE PROTECTED HIM
1343-158781-0017 IF IT HAD HAPPENED TO ME I SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANGRY SAID MISSUS CARBUNCLE BUT FRANK WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A HORSE AT ALL SAID LIZZIE UNLESS HE HAD TAKEN MISTER NAPPIE'S
1343-158781-0018 IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR YOUR NOBLE MASTER TO TALK OF BEING CIVIL AND HOPING THAT THE HORSE HAD CARRIED HIM WELL AND ALL THAT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A MAN CAN'T BE CIVIL AND THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM
1343-158781-0019 WITHOUT NAMING THE PRICE HE'D SEND YOU GREY STOCKINGS INSTEAD SAID LIZZIE BUT THOUGH LIZZIE WAS IN HEAVEN IT BEHOVED HER TO BE CAREFUL
1343-158781-0020 THE CORSAIR WAS A VERY FINE SPECIMEN OF THE CORSAIR BREED ABOUT THE BEST CORSAIR SHE HAD EVER SEEN AND HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO HER FOR THE DAY BUT THESE CORSAIRS ARE KNOWN TO BE DANGEROUS
1343-158781-0021 AND IT WOULD NOT BE WISE THAT SHE SHOULD SACRIFICE ANY FUTURE PROSPECT OF IMPORTANCE ON BEHALF OF A FEELING WHICH NO DOUBT WAS FOUNDED ON POETRY BUT WHICH MIGHT TOO PROBABLY HAVE NO POSSIBLE BENEFICIAL RESULT
1343-158781-0022 AS FAR AS SHE KNEW THE CORSAIR HAD NOT EVEN AN ISLAND OF HIS OWN IN THE AEGEAN SEA AND IF HE HAD MIGHT NOT THE ISLAND TOO PROBABLY HAVE A MEDORA OR TWO OF ITS OWN
1343-158781-0023 IN A RIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE CORSAIR WAS ALL THAT A CORSAIR SHOULD BE BUT KNOWING AS SHE DID BUT VERY LITTLE OF THE CORSAIR SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO THROW OVER HER COUSIN FOR HIS SAKE
1343-158781-0024 AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE MANAGED TO SAY ONE WORD TO HER COUSIN YOU WERE NOT ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE I GOT LORD GEORGE TO RIDE WITH ME INSTEAD OF YOU ANGRY WITH YOU
1343-158781-0025 I KNEW I SHOULD ONLY BE A HINDRANCE TO YOU IT WAS A MATTER OF COURSE HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT AND I KNOW NOTHING I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU LIKED IT SO MUCH I DID LIKE IT AND SO DID YOU
1343-158781-0026 I WAS SO GLAD YOU GOT THAT POOR MAN'S HORSE YOU WERE NOT ANGRY THEN THEY HAD NOW PASSED ACROSS THE HALL AND WERE ON THE BOTTOM STAIR CERTAINLY NOT AND YOU ARE NOT ANGRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE
1343-158781-0027 SHE DID NOT LOOK INTO HIS FACE AS SHE ASKED THIS QUESTION BUT STOOD WITH HER EYES FIXED ON THE STAIR CARPET INDEED NO GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT LIZZIE
1343-158781-0028 THEN SHE WENT AND HE RETURNED TO A ROOM BELOW WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR PURPOSES OF TOBACCO AND SODA WATER AND BRANDY WHY GRIFF YOU'RE RATHER OUT OF SORTS TO NIGHT SAID LORD GEORGE TO HIS FRIEND
1343-158781-0029 BEFORE FRANK HAD JOINED THEM SO WOULD YOU BE OUT OF SORTS IF YOU'D LOST YOUR RUN AND HAD TO PICK A YOUNG WOMAN OUT OF THE WATER I DON'T LIKE YOUNG WOMEN WHEN THEY'RE DAMP AND SMELL OF MUD YOU MEAN TO MARRY HER I SUPPOSE
1343-158781-0030 AS FOR MARRYING THE WIDOW I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE FACTS FIRST AS TO MISSUS C SHE WOULDN'T OBJECT IN THE LEAST I GENERALLY HAVE MY HORSES SO BITTED THAT THEY CAN'T VERY WELL OBJECT
1343-158781-0031 AND AS TO THE OTHER QUESTION I MEAN TO STAY HERE FOR THE NEXT FORTNIGHT AND I ADVISE YOU TO MAKE IT SQUARE WITH MISS ROANOKE HERE'S MY LADY'S COUSIN FOR A MAN WHO DOESN'T RIDE OFTEN HE WENT VERY WELL TO DAY
1343-158781-0032 I WONDER IF HE'D TAKE A TWENTY POUND NOTE IF I SENT IT TO HIM SAID FRANK WHEN THEY BROKE UP FOR THE NIGHT I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF RIDING SUCH A FELLOW'S HORSE FOR NOTHING
1343-158781-0033 HE'LL BRING AN ACTION AGAINST THE RAILWAY AND THEN YOU CAN OFFER TO PAY IF YOU LIKE MISTER NAPPIE DID BRING AN ACTION AGAINST THE RAILWAY CLAIMING EXORBITANT DAMAGES
