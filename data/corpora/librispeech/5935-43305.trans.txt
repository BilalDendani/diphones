5935-43305-0000 VICTORIA STATION STILL NAMED AFTER THE GREAT NINETEENTH CENTURY QUEEN WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS BUSY THAN USUAL AS HE CAME INTO IT HALF AN HOUR LATER THE VAST PLATFORM
5935-43305-0001 SUNK NOW NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE GROUND LEVEL SHOWED THE DOUBLE CROWD OF PASSENGERS ENTERING AND LEAVING TOWN THOSE ON THE EXTREME LEFT TOWARDS WHOM PERCY BEGAN TO DESCEND IN THE OPEN GLAZED LIFT
5935-43305-0002 WERE BY FAR THE MOST NUMEROUS AND THE STREAM AT THE LIFT ENTRANCE MADE IT NECESSARY FOR HIM TO MOVE SLOWLY HE ARRIVED AT LAST WALKING IN THE SOFT LIGHT ON THE NOISELESS RIBBED RUBBER
5935-43305-0003 HE STEPPED IN AND SAT DOWN HE FELT QUIET NOW THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY STARTED HE HAD MADE HIS CONFESSION JUST IN ORDER TO MAKE CERTAIN OF HIS OWN SOUL THOUGH SCARCELY EXPECTING ANY DEFINITE DANGER
5935-43305-0004 AND SAT NOW HIS GREY SUIT AND STRAW HAT IN NO WAY DISTINGUISHING HIM AS A PRIEST FOR A GENERAL LEAVE WAS GIVEN BY THE AUTHORITIES TO DRESS SO FOR ANY ADEQUATE REASON SINCE THE CASE WAS NOT IMMINENT
5935-43305-0005 FATHER DOLAN HAD WIRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT FETCH THEM IF HE WISHED FROM SAINT JOSEPH'S NEAR THE JUNCTION HE HAD ONLY THE VIOLET THREAD IN HIS POCKET SUCH AS WAS CUSTOMARY FOR SICK CALLS HE WAS SLIDING ALONG PEACEABLY ENOUGH
5935-43305-0006 THAT THEY WERE ALREADY IN THE TUNNEL THE STOPPAGE MIGHT ARISE FROM MANY CAUSES AND HE WAS NOT GREATLY EXCITED NOR DID IT SEEM THAT OTHERS IN THE CARRIAGE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY HE COULD HEAR AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE THE TALKING RECOMMENCE BEYOND THE PARTITION
5935-43305-0007 THEN THERE CAME ECHOED BY THE WALLS THE SOUND OF SHOUTING FROM FAR AWAY MINGLED WITH HOOTS AND CHORDS IT GREW LOUDER THE TALKING IN THE CARRIAGE STOPPED HE HEARD A WINDOW THROWN UP
5935-43305-0008 AND THE NEXT INSTANT A CAR TORE PAST GOING BACK TO THE STATION ALTHOUGH ON THE DOWN LINE THIS MUST BE LOOKED INTO THOUGHT PERCY SOMETHING CERTAINLY WAS HAPPENING SO HE GOT UP AND WENT ACROSS THE EMPTY COMPARTMENT TO THE FURTHER WINDOW
5935-43305-0009 AGAIN CAME THE CRYING OF VOICES AGAIN THE SIGNALS AND ONCE MORE A CAR WHIRLED PAST FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY ANOTHER THERE WAS A JERK A SMOOTH MOVEMENT PERCY STAGGERED AND FELL INTO A SEAT
5935-43305-0010 WHO PAID ABSOLUTELY NO ATTENTION TO HIS INQUIRIES SO HE STOOD THERE AWARE THAT THEY KNEW NO MORE THAN HIMSELF WAITING FOR AN EXPLANATION FROM SOME ONE IT WAS DISGRACEFUL HE TOLD HIMSELF
5935-43305-0011 AH THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED THE INSTANT HE OPENED THE DOOR A GREAT ROAR MET HIS EARS AND AS HE SPRANG ON TO THE PLATFORM AND LOOKED UP AT THE END OF THE STATION HE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND
5935-43305-0012 FROM RIGHT TO LEFT OF THE HUGE INTERIOR ACROSS THE PLATFORMS SWELLING EVERY INSTANT SURGED AN ENORMOUS SWAYING ROARING CROWD THE FLIGHT OF STEPS TWENTY YARDS BROAD
5935-43305-0013 THE NOISE WAS INDESCRIBABLE THE SHOUTING OF MEN THE SCREAMING OF WOMEN THE CLANG AND HOOT OF THE HUGE MACHINES AND THREE OR FOUR TIMES THE BRAZEN CRY OF A TRUMPET AS AN EMERGENCY DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN OVERHEAD
5935-43305-0014 AND A SMALL SWIRL OF CROWD POURED THROUGH IT TOWARDS THE STREETS BEYOND BUT AFTER ONE LOOK PERCY LOOKED NO MORE AT THE PEOPLE FOR THERE HIGH UP BENEATH THE CLOCK ON THE GOVERNMENT SIGNAL BOARD
5935-43305-0015 FLARED OUT MONSTROUS LETTERS OF FIRE TELLING IN ESPERANTO AND ENGLISH THE MESSAGE FOR WHICH ENGLAND HAD GROWN SICK HE READ IT A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE HE MOVED STARING
5935-43305-0016 AS AT A SUPERNATURAL SIGHT WHICH MIGHT DENOTE THE TRIUMPH OF EITHER HEAVEN OR HELL EASTERN CONVENTION DISPERSED PEACE NOT WAR UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD ESTABLISHED
