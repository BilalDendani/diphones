5154-6174-0000 MEANTIME THE WISE WOMAN WAS BUSY AS SHE ALWAYS WAS AND HER BUSINESS NOW WAS WITH THE CHILD OF THE SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS AWAY IN THE NORTH HER NAME WAS AGNES HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE POOR AND COULD NOT GIVE HER MANY THINGS
5154-6174-0001 ROSAMOND WOULD HAVE UTTERLY DESPISED THE RUDE SIMPLE PLAYTHINGS SHE HAD YET IN ONE RESPECT THEY WERE OF MORE VALUE FAR THAN HERS THE KING BOUGHT ROSAMOND'S WITH HIS MONEY
5154-6174-0002 AND WHILE AGNES HAD BUT FEW THINGS NOT SEEING MANY THINGS ABOUT HER AND NOT EVEN KNOWING THAT THERE WERE MANY THINGS ANYWHERE SHE DID NOT WISH FOR MANY THINGS AND WAS THEREFORE NEITHER COVETOUS NOR AVARICIOUS
5154-6174-0003 SHE PLAYED WITH THE TOYS HER FATHER MADE HER AND THOUGHT THEM THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE WORLD WINDMILLS AND LITTLE CROOKS AND WATER WHEELS AND SOMETIMES LAMBS MADE ALL OF WOOL AND DOLLS MADE OUT OF THE LEG BONES OF SHEEP WHICH HER MOTHER DRESSED FOR HER
5154-6174-0004 AND OF SUCH PLAYTHINGS SHE WAS NEVER TIRED SOMETIMES HOWEVER SHE PREFERRED PLAYING WITH STONES WHICH WERE PLENTIFUL AND FLOWERS WHICH WERE FEW OR THE BROOKS THAT RAN DOWN THE HILL OF WHICH
5154-6174-0005 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE MANY SHE COULD ONLY PLAY WITH ONE AT A TIME AND THAT INDEED TROUBLED HER A LITTLE OR LIVE LAMBS THAT WERE NOT ALL WOOL OR THE SHEEP DOGS WHICH WERE VERY FRIENDLY WITH HER AND THE BEST OF PLAYFELLOWS AS SHE THOUGHT FOR SHE HAD NO HUMAN ONES TO COMPARE THEM WITH
5154-6174-0006 NEITHER WAS SHE GREEDY AFTER NICE THINGS BUT CONTENT AS WELL SHE MIGHT BE WITH THE HOMELY FOOD PROVIDED FOR HER NOR WAS SHE BY NATURE PARTICULARLY SELF WILLED OR DISOBEDIENT SHE GENERALLY DID WHAT HER FATHER AND MOTHER WISHED AND BELIEVED WHAT THEY TOLD HER
5154-6174-0007 BUT BY DEGREES THEY HAD SPOILED HER AND THIS WAS THE WAY THEY WERE SO PROUD OF HER THAT THEY ALWAYS REPEATED EVERY THING SHE SAID AND TOLD EVERY THING SHE DID EVEN WHEN SHE WAS PRESENT
5154-6174-0008 AND SO FULL OF ADMIRATION OF THEIR CHILD WERE THEY THAT THEY WONDERED AND LAUGHED AT AND PRAISED THINGS IN HER WHICH IN ANOTHER CHILD WOULD NEVER HAVE STRUCK THEM AS THE LEAST REMARKABLE AND SOME THINGS EVEN
5154-6174-0009 WHICH WOULD IN ANOTHER HAVE DISGUSTED THEM ALTOGETHER IMPERTINENT AND RUDE THINGS DONE BY THEIR CHILD THEY THOUGHT SO CLEVER LAUGHING AT THEM AS SOMETHING QUITE MARVELLOUS
5154-6174-0010 HER COMMONPLACE SPEECHES WERE SAID OVER AGAIN AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THE FINEST POETRY AND THE PRETTY WAYS WHICH EVERY MODERATELY GOOD CHILD HAS WERE EXTOLLED AS IF THE RESULT OF HER EXCELLENT TASTE AND THE CHOICE OF HER JUDGMENT AND WILL
5154-6174-0011 THEY WOULD EVEN SAY SOMETIMES THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HEAR HER OWN PRAISES FOR FEAR IT SHOULD MAKE HER VAIN AND THEN WHISPER THEM BEHIND THEIR HANDS BUT SO LOUD THAT SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO HEAR EVERY WORD THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
5154-6174-0012 THAT SHE SOON CAME TO BELIEVE SO SOON THAT SHE COULD NOT RECALL THE TIME WHEN SHE DID NOT BELIEVE AS THE MOST ABSOLUTE FACT IN THE UNIVERSE THAT SHE WAS SOMEBODY THAT IS SHE BECAME MOST IMMODERATELY CONCEITED
5154-6174-0013 NOW AS THE LEAST ATOM OF CONCEIT IS A THING TO BE ASHAMED OF YOU MAY FANCY WHAT SHE WAS LIKE WITH SUCH A QUANTITY OF IT INSIDE HER AT FIRST IT DID NOT SHOW ITSELF OUTSIDE IN ANY VERY ACTIVE FORM
5154-6174-0014 BUT THE WISE WOMAN HAD BEEN TO THE COTTAGE AND HAD SEEN HER SITTING ALONE WITH SUCH A SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION UPON HER FACE AS WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE STARTLING TO HER IF SHE HAD EVER BEEN STARTLED AT ANY THING FOR THROUGH THAT SMILE
5154-6174-0015 SHE COULD SEE LYING AT THE ROOT OF IT THE WORM THAT MADE IT FOR SOME SMILES ARE LIKE THE RUDDINESS OF CERTAIN APPLES WHICH IS OWING TO A CENTIPEDE OR
5154-6174-0016 ONLY HER WORM HAD A FACE AND
5154-6174-0017 VERY IMAGE OF HER OWN AND SHE LOOKED SO SIMPERING AND MAWKISH AND SELF CONSCIOUS AND SILLY THAT SHE MADE THE WISE WOMAN FEEL RATHER SICK NOT THAT THE CHILD WAS A FOOL
5154-6174-0018 HAD SHE BEEN THE WISE WOMAN WOULD HAVE ONLY PITIED AND LOVED HER INSTEAD OF FEELING SICK WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HER SHE HAD VERY FAIR ABILITIES AND WERE SHE ONCE BUT MADE HUMBLE WOULD BE CAPABLE NOT ONLY OF DOING A GOOD DEAL IN TIME
5154-6174-0019 BUT OF BEGINNING AT ONCE TO GROW TO NO END BUT IF SHE WERE NOT MADE HUMBLE HER GROWING WOULD BE TO A MASS OF DISTORTED SHAPES ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE BODY SHE NOW SHOWED MIGHT GROW UP STRAIGHT AND WELL SHAPED AND COMELY TO BEHOLD
5154-6174-0020 THE NEW BODY THAT WAS GROWING INSIDE OF IT AND WOULD COME OUT OF IT WHEN SHE DIED WOULD BE UGLY AND CROOKED THIS WAY AND THAT LIKE AN AGED HAWTHORN THAT HAS LIVED HUNDREDS OF YEARS EXPOSED UPON ALL SIDES TO SALT SEA WINDS
5154-6174-0021 AS TIME WENT ON THIS DISEASE OF SELF CONCEIT WENT ON TOO GRADUALLY DEVOURING THE GOOD THAT WAS IN HER FOR THERE IS NO FAULT THAT DOES NOT BRING ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND COUSINS TO LIVE WITH IT
5154-6174-0022 BY DEGREES FROM THINKING HERSELF SO CLEVER SHE CAME TO FANCY THAT WHATEVER SEEMED TO HER MUST OF COURSE BE THE CORRECT JUDGMENT AND WHATEVER SHE WISHED THE RIGHT THING AND GREW SO OBSTINATE
5154-6174-0023 THAT AT LENGTH HER PARENTS FEARED TO THWART HER IN ANY THING KNOWING WELL THAT SHE WOULD NEVER GIVE IN BUT THERE ARE VICTORIES FAR WORSE THAN DEFEATS AND TO OVERCOME AN ANGEL TOO GENTLE TO PUT OUT ALL HIS STRENGTH
5154-6174-0024 AND RIDE AWAY IN TRIUMPH ON THE BACK OF A DEVIL IS ONE OF THE POOREST SO LONG AS SHE WAS LEFT TO TAKE HER OWN WAY AND DO AS SHE WOULD SHE GAVE HER PARENTS LITTLE TROUBLE SHE WOULD PLAY ABOUT BY HERSELF IN THE LITTLE GARDEN WITH ITS FEW HARDY FLOWERS
5154-6174-0025 OR AMONGST THE HEATHER WHERE THE BEES WERE BUSY OR SHE WOULD WANDER AWAY AMONGST THE HILLS AND BE NOBODY KNEW WHERE SOMETIMES FROM MORNING TO NIGHT NOR DID HER PARENTS VENTURE TO FIND FAULT WITH HER SHE NEVER WENT INTO RAGES LIKE THE PRINCESS
5154-6174-0026 BUT SHE WAS NO BETTER FOR ALL THAT AND WAS QUITE AS UGLY IN THE EYES OF THE WISE WOMAN WHO COULD NOT ONLY SEE BUT READ HER FACE
5154-6174-0027 AND ONE DISTORTED TO SILLINESS BY SELF COMPLACENCY TRUE THERE IS MORE HOPE OF HELPING THE ANGRY CHILD OUT OF HER FORM OF SELFISHNESS THAN THE CONCEITED CHILD OUT OF HERS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE CONCEITED CHILD
5154-6174-0028 WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE OR DANGEROUS AS THE WRATHFUL ONE THE CONCEITED ONE HOWEVER WAS SOMETIMES VERY ANGRY AND THEN HER ANGER WAS MORE SPITEFUL THAN THE OTHER'S AND AGAIN THE WRATHFUL ONE WAS OFTEN VERY CONCEITED TOO
5154-6174-0029 SO THAT ON THE WHOLE OF TWO VERY UNPLEASANT CREATURES I WOULD SAY THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WORSE HAD NOT THE SHEPHERD'S BEEN QUITE AS BAD BUT AS I HAVE SAID
5154-6174-0030 THE WISE WOMAN HAD HER EYE UPON HER SHE SAW THAT SOMETHING SPECIAL MUST BE DONE ELSE SHE WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE WHO KNEEL TO THEIR OWN SHADOWS TILL FEET GROW ON THEIR KNEES THEN GO DOWN ON THEIR HANDS TILL THEIR HANDS GROW INTO FEET
5154-6174-0031 THEN LAY THEIR FACES ON THE GROUND TILL THEY GROW INTO SNOUTS WHEN AT LAST THEY ARE A HIDEOUS SORT OF LIZARDS EACH OF WHICH BELIEVES HIMSELF THE BEST WISEST AND LOVELIEST BEING IN THE WORLD YEA THE VERY CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE
5154-6174-0032 AND SO THEY RUN ABOUT FOREVER LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN SHADOWS THAT THEY MAY WORSHIP THEM AND MISERABLE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FIND THEM BEING THEMSELVES TOO NEAR THE GROUND TO HAVE ANY SHADOWS AND WHAT BECOMES OF THEM AT LAST THERE IS BUT ONE WHO KNOWS
5154-6174-0033 THE WISE WOMAN THEREFORE ONE DAY WALKED UP TO THE DOOR OF THE SHEPHERD'S COTTAGE DRESSED LIKE A POOR WOMAN AND ASKED FOR A DRINK OF WATER THE SHEPHERD'S WIFE LOOKED AT HER LIKED HER AND BROUGHT HER A CUP OF MILK
5154-6174-0034 THE WISE WOMAN TOOK IT FOR SHE MADE IT A RULE TO ACCEPT EVERY KINDNESS THAT WAS OFFERED HER AGNES WAS NOT BY NATURE A GREEDY GIRL AS I HAVE SAID BUT SELF CONCEIT WILL GO FAR TO GENERATE EVERY OTHER VICE UNDER THE SUN
5154-6174-0035 VANITY WHICH IS A FORM OF SELF CONCEIT HAS REPEATEDLY SHOWN ITSELF AS THE DEEPEST FEELING IN THE HEART OF A HORRIBLE MURDERESS THAT MORNING AT BREAKFAST HER MOTHER HAD STINTED HER IN MILK JUST A LITTLE
5154-6174-0036 THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME MILK PORRIDGE FOR THEIR DINNER AGNES DID NOT MIND IT AT THE TIME BUT WHEN SHE SAW THE MILK NOW GIVEN TO A BEGGAR AS SHE CALLED THE WISE WOMAN
5154-6174-0037 AND ACCEPT A DRAUGHT OF MILK WITHOUT BEING A BEGGAR IN ANY SUCH SENSE AS AGNES'S CONTEMPTUOUS USE OF THE WORD IMPLIED A CLOUD CAME UPON HER FOREHEAD
5154-6174-0038 AND A DOUBLE VERTICAL WRINKLE SETTLED OVER HER NOSE THE WISE WOMAN SAW IT FOR ALL HER BUSINESS WAS WITH AGNES THOUGH SHE LITTLE KNEW IT AND RISING WENT AND OFFERED THE CUP TO THE CHILD WHERE SHE SAT WITH HER KNITTING IN A CORNER
5154-6174-0039 AGNES LOOKED AT IT DID NOT WANT IT WAS INCLINED TO REFUSE IT FROM A BEGGAR BUT THINKING IT WOULD SHOW HER CONSEQUENCE TO ASSERT HER RIGHTS TOOK IT AND DRANK IT UP
5154-6174-0040 FOR WHOEVER IS POSSESSED BY A DEVIL JUDGES WITH THE MIND OF THAT DEVIL AND HENCE AGNES WAS GUILTY OF SUCH A MEANNESS AS MANY WHO ARE THEMSELVES CAPABLE OF SOMETHING JUST AS BAD WILL CONSIDER INCREDIBLE THE WISE WOMAN WAITED
5154-6174-0041 TILL SHE HAD FINISHED IT THEN LOOKING INTO THE EMPTY CUP SAID YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME BACK AS MUCH AS YOU HAD NO CLAIM UPON AGNES TURNED AWAY AND MADE NO ANSWER FAR LESS FROM SHAME THAN INDIGNATION
5154-6174-0042 THE WISE WOMAN LOOKED AT THE MOTHER YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED IT TO HER IF YOU DID NOT MEAN HER TO HAVE IT SAID THE MOTHER SIDING WITH THE DEVIL IN HER CHILD AGAINST THE WISE WOMAN AND HER CHILD TOO SOME FOOLISH PEOPLE THINK THEY TAKE ANOTHER'S PART
5154-6174-0043 WHEN THEY TAKE THE PART HE TAKES THE WISE WOMAN SAID NOTHING BUT FIXED HER EYES UPON HER AND SOON THE MOTHER HID HER FACE IN HER APRON WEEPING THEN SHE TURNED AGAIN TO AGNES WHO HAD NEVER LOOKED ROUND BUT SAT WITH HER BACK TO BOTH
5154-6174-0044 AND SUDDENLY LAPPED HER IN THE FOLDS OF HER CLOAK WHEN THE MOTHER AGAIN LIFTED HER EYES SHE HAD VANISHED
5154-6174-0045 UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID TO THE POOR WOMAN THE MOTHER WENT TO THE DOOR AND CALLED AFTER HER AS SHE TOILED SLOWLY UP THE HILL BUT SHE NEVER TURNED HER HEAD AND THE MOTHER WENT BACK INTO HER COTTAGE
5154-6174-0046 THE WISE WOMAN WALKED CLOSE PAST THE SHEPHERD AND HIS DOGS AND THROUGH THE MIDST OF HIS FLOCK OF SHEEP THE SHEPHERD WONDERED WHERE SHE COULD BE GOING RIGHT UP THE HILL
5154-6174-0047 AND HE FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE WENT UP AND UP IT WAS NEAR SUNSET AND AS THE SUN WENT DOWN A GRAY CLOUD SETTLED ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WHICH HIS LAST RAYS TURNED INTO A ROSY GOLD
5154-6174-0048 STRAIGHT INTO THIS CLOUD THE SHEPHERD SAW THE WOMAN HOLD HER PACE AND IN IT SHE VANISHED HE LITTLE IMAGINED THAT HIS CHILD WAS UNDER HER CLOAK HE WENT HOME AS USUAL IN THE EVENING BUT AGNES HAD NOT COME IN
5154-6174-0049 THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH AN ABSENCE NOW AND THEN AND WERE NOT AT FIRST FRIGHTENED BUT WHEN IT GREW DARK AND SHE DID NOT APPEAR THE HUSBAND SET OUT WITH HIS DOGS IN ONE DIRECTION AND THE WIFE IN ANOTHER TO SEEK THEIR CHILD
5154-6174-0050 MORNING CAME AND THEY HAD NOT FOUND HER THEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE AROSE TO SEARCH FOR THE MISSING AGNES BUT DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT PASSED AND NOTHING WAS DISCOVERED OF OR CONCERNING HER
5154-6174-0051 UNTIL AT LENGTH ALL GAVE UP THE SEARCH IN DESPAIR EXCEPT THE MOTHER ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NEARLY CONVINCED NOW THAT THE POOR WOMAN HAD CARRIED HER OFF ONE DAY
5154-6174-0052 SHE HAD WANDERED SOME DISTANCE FROM HER COTTAGE THINKING SHE MIGHT COME UPON THE REMAINS OF HER DAUGHTER AT THE FOOT OF SOME CLIFF WHEN SHE CAME SUDDENLY INSTEAD UPON A DISCONSOLATE LOOKING CREATURE SITTING ON A STONE BY THE SIDE OF A STREAM
5154-6174-0053 HER HAIR HUNG IN TANGLES FROM HER HEAD HER CLOTHES WERE TATTERED AND THROUGH THE RENTS HER SKIN SHOWED IN MANY PLACES HER CHEEKS WERE WHITE AND WORN THIN WITH HUNGER THE HOLLOWS WERE DARK UNDER HER EYES AND THEY STOOD OUT SCARED AND WILD
5154-6174-0054 AT FIRST SIGHT THE MOTHER HAD TAKEN HER FOR HER OWN CHILD
5154-6174-0055 FULL OF COMPASSION NEVERTHELESS SHE SAID TO HERSELF IF SHE IS NOT MY AGNES SHE IS AS MUCH IN NEED OF HELP AS IF SHE WERE IF I CANNOT BE GOOD TO MY OWN
5154-6174-0056 I WILL BE AS GOOD AS I CAN TO SOME OTHER WOMAN'S AND THOUGH I SHOULD SCORN TO BE CONSOLED FOR THE LOSS OF ONE BY THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER I YET MAY FIND SOME GLADNESS IN RESCUING ONE CHILD FROM THE DEATH WHICH HAS TAKEN THE OTHER
5154-6174-0057 PERHAPS HER WORDS WERE NOT JUST LIKE THESE BUT HER THOUGHTS WERE SHE TOOK UP THE CHILD AND CARRIED HER HOME
