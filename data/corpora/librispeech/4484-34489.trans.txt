4484-34489-0000 AS HE NEARED PETERSBURG ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH NOT ONLY ADHERED ENTIRELY TO HIS DECISION BUT WAS EVEN COMPOSING IN HIS HEAD THE LETTER HE WOULD WRITE TO HIS WIFE GOING INTO THE PORTER'S ROOM
4484-34489-0001 ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH GLANCED AT THE LETTERS AND PAPERS BROUGHT FROM HIS OFFICE AND DIRECTED THAT THEY SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO HIM IN HIS STUDY THE HORSES CAN BE TAKEN OUT AND I WILL SEE NO ONE HE SAID IN ANSWER TO THE PORTER WITH A CERTAIN PLEASURE
4484-34489-0002 INDICATIVE OF HIS AGREEABLE FRAME OF MIND EMPHASIZING THE WORDS SEE NO ONE IN HIS STUDY ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH WALKED UP AND DOWN TWICE AND STOPPED AT AN IMMENSE WRITING TABLE
4484-34489-0003 ON WHICH SIX CANDLES HAD ALREADY BEEN LIGHTED BY THE VALET WHO HAD PRECEDED HIM HE CRACKED HIS KNUCKLES AND SAT DOWN SORTING OUT HIS WRITING APPURTENANCES PUTTING HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE HE BENT HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE
4484-34489-0004 THOUGHT A MINUTE AND BEGAN TO WRITE WITHOUT PAUSING FOR A SECOND HE WROTE WITHOUT USING ANY FORM OF ADDRESS TO HER AND WROTE IN FRENCH MAKING USE OF THE PLURAL VOUS WHICH HAS NOT THE SAME NOTE OF COLDNESS AS THE CORRESPONDING RUSSIAN FORM

4484-34489-0009 I WOULD BEG YOU TO RETURN TO PETERSBURG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE NOT LATER THAN TUESDAY ALL NECESSARY PREPARATIONS SHALL BE MADE FOR YOUR ARRIVAL HERE I BEG YOU TO NOTE THAT I ATTACH PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE TO COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REQUEST
4484-34489-0010 A KARENIN P S I ENCLOSE THE MONEY WHICH MAY BE NEEDED FOR YOUR EXPENSES HE READ THE LETTER THROUGH AND FELT PLEASED WITH IT AND ESPECIALLY THAT HE HAD REMEMBERED TO ENCLOSE MONEY
4484-34489-0011 THERE WAS NOT A HARSH WORD NOT A REPROACH IN IT NOR WAS THERE UNDUE INDULGENCE MOST OF ALL IT WAS A GOLDEN BRIDGE FOR RETURN FOLDING THE LETTER AND SMOOTHING IT WITH A MASSIVE IVORY KNIFE
4484-34489-0012 HE RANG THE BELL WITH THE GRATIFICATION IT ALWAYS AFFORDED HIM TO USE THE WELL ARRANGED APPOINTMENTS OF HIS WRITING TABLE GIVE THIS TO THE COURIER TO BE DELIVERED TO ANNA ARKADYEVNA TOMORROW AT THE SUMMER VILLA HE SAID GETTING UP CERTAINLY YOUR EXCELLENCY
4484-34489-0013 TEA TO BE SERVED IN THE STUDY ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH ORDERED TEA TO BE BROUGHT TO THE STUDY AND PLAYING WITH THE MASSIVE PAPER KNIFE HE MOVED TO HIS EASY CHAIR NEAR WHICH THERE HAD BEEN PLACED READY FOR HIM A LAMP
4484-34489-0014 AND THE FRENCH WORK ON EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS THAT HE HAD BEGUN OVER THE EASY CHAIR THERE HUNG IN A GOLD FRAME AN OVAL PORTRAIT OF ANNA A FINE PAINTING BY A CELEBRATED ARTIST ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH GLANCED AT IT
4484-34489-0015 THE UNFATHOMABLE EYES GAZED IRONICALLY AND INSOLENTLY AT HIM INSUFFERABLY INSOLENT AND CHALLENGING WAS THE EFFECT IN ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S EYES OF THE BLACK LACE ABOUT THE HEAD ADMIRABLY TOUCHED IN BY THE PAINTER
4484-34489-0016 THE BLACK HAIR AND HANDSOME WHITE HAND WITH ONE FINGER LIFTED COVERED WITH RINGS AFTER LOOKING AT THE PORTRAIT FOR A MINUTE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHUDDERED SO THAT HIS LIPS QUIVERED
4484-34489-0017 HE MADE HASTE TO SIT DOWN IN HIS EASY CHAIR AND OPENED THE BOOK HE TRIED TO READ BUT HE COULD NOT REVIVE THE VERY VIVID INTEREST HE HAD FELT BEFORE IN EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS HE LOOKED AT THE BOOK AND THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ELSE
4484-34489-0018 HE THOUGHT NOT OF HIS WIFE BUT OF A COMPLICATION THAT HAD ARISEN IN HIS OFFICIAL LIFE WHICH AT THE TIME CONSTITUTED THE CHIEF INTEREST OF IT HE FELT THAT HE HAD PENETRATED MORE DEEPLY THAN EVER BEFORE INTO THIS INTRICATE AFFAIR
4484-34489-0019 AND THAT HE HAD ORIGINATED A LEADING IDEA HE COULD SAY IT WITHOUT SELF FLATTERY CALCULATED TO CLEAR UP THE WHOLE BUSINESS TO STRENGTHEN HIM IN HIS OFFICIAL CAREER TO DISCOMFIT HIS ENEMIES
4484-34489-0020 AND THEREBY TO BE OF THE GREATEST BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY THE SERVANT HAD SET THE TEA AND LEFT THE ROOM ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH GOT UP AND WENT TO THE WRITING TABLE
4484-34489-0021 MOVING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE A PORTFOLIO OF PAPERS WITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION HE TOOK A PENCIL FROM A RACK AND PLUNGED INTO THE PERUSAL OF A COMPLEX REPORT RELATING TO THE PRESENT COMPLICATION
4484-34489-0022 THE COMPLICATION WAS OF THIS NATURE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S CHARACTERISTIC QUALITY AS A POLITICIAN THAT SPECIAL INDIVIDUAL QUALIFICATION THAT EVERY RISING FUNCTIONARY POSSESSES
4484-34489-0023 THE QUALIFICATION THAT WITH HIS UNFLAGGING AMBITION HIS RESERVE HIS HONESTY AND WITH HIS SELF CONFIDENCE HAD MADE HIS CAREER WAS HIS CONTEMPT FOR RED TAPE HIS CUTTING DOWN OF CORRESPONDENCE
4484-34489-0024 HIS DIRECT CONTACT WHEREVER POSSIBLE WITH THE LIVING FACT AND HIS ECONOMY IT HAPPENED THAT THE FAMOUS COMMISSION OF THE SECOND OF JUNE HAD SET ON FOOT AN INQUIRY INTO THE IRRIGATION OF LANDS IN THE ZARAISKY PROVINCE
4484-34489-0025 WHICH FELL UNDER ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S DEPARTMENT AND WAS A GLARING EXAMPLE OF FRUITLESS EXPENDITURE AND PAPER REFORMS ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH WAS AWARE OF THE TRUTH OF THIS THE IRRIGATION OF THESE LANDS IN THE ZARAISKY PROVINCE
4484-34489-0026 HAD BEEN INITIATED BY THE PREDECESSOR OF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S PREDECESSOR AND VAST SUMS OF MONEY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN SPENT AND WERE STILL BEING SPENT ON THIS BUSINESS AND UTTERLY UNPRODUCTIVELY
4484-34489-0027 AND THE WHOLE BUSINESS COULD OBVIOUSLY LEAD TO NOTHING WHATEVER ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HAD PERCEIVED THIS AT ONCE ON ENTERING OFFICE AND WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LAY HANDS ON THE BOARD OF IRRIGATION BUT AT FIRST WHEN HE DID NOT YET FEEL SECURE IN HIS POSITION
4484-34489-0028 HE KNEW IT WOULD AFFECT TOO MANY INTERESTS AND WOULD BE INJUDICIOUS LATER ON HE HAD BEEN ENGROSSED IN OTHER QUESTIONS AND HAD SIMPLY FORGOTTEN THE BOARD OF IRRIGATION IT WENT OF ITSELF LIKE ALL SUCH BOARDS
4484-34489-0029 BY THE MERE FORCE OF INERTIA MANY PEOPLE GAINED THEIR LIVELIHOOD BY THE BOARD OF IRRIGATION ESPECIALLY ONE HIGHLY CONSCIENTIOUS AND MUSICAL FAMILY ALL THE DAUGHTERS PLAYED ON STRINGED INSTRUMENTS AND ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH KNEW THE FAMILY
4484-34489-0030 AND HAD STOOD GODFATHER TO ONE OF THE ELDER DAUGHTERS THE RAISING OF THIS QUESTION BY A HOSTILE DEPARTMENT WAS IN ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S OPINION A DISHONORABLE PROCEEDING SEEING THAT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT THERE WERE THINGS SIMILAR AND WORSE
4484-34489-0031 WHICH NO ONE INQUIRED INTO FOR WELL KNOWN REASONS OF OFFICIAL ETIQUETTE HOWEVER NOW THAT THE GLOVE HAD BEEN THROWN DOWN TO HIM HE HAD BOLDLY PICKED IT UP AND DEMANDED THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE
4484-34489-0032 AND VERIFY THE WORKING OF THE BOARD OF IRRIGATION OF THE LANDS IN THE ZARAISKY PROVINCE BUT IN COMPENSATION HE GAVE NO QUARTER TO THE ENEMY EITHER HE DEMANDED THE APPOINTMENT OF ANOTHER SPECIAL COMMISSION
4484-34489-0033 TO INQUIRE INTO THE QUESTION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE THE QUESTION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP INCIDENTALLY IN THE COMMISSION OF THE SECOND OF JUNE AND HAD BEEN PRESSED FORWARD ACTIVELY BY ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH
4484-34489-0034 AS ONE ADMITTING OF NO DELAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEPLORABLE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES IN THE COMMISSION THIS QUESTION HAD BEEN A GROUND OF CONTENTION BETWEEN SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENT HOSTILE TO ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH
4484-34489-0035 PROVED THAT THE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES WAS EXCEEDINGLY FLOURISHING THAT THE PROPOSED RECONSTRUCTION MIGHT BE THE RUIN OF THEIR PROSPERITY AND THAT IF THERE WERE ANYTHING WRONG IT AROSE MAINLY FROM THE FAILURE ON THE PART OF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S DEPARTMENT
4484-34489-0036 TO CARRY OUT THE MEASURES PRESCRIBED BY LAW NOW ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH INTENDED TO DEMAND FIRST THAT A NEW COMMISSION SHOULD BE FORMED WHICH SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO INVESTIGATE THE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES ON THE SPOT
4484-34489-0037 SECONDLY IF IT SHOULD APPEAR THAT THE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES ACTUALLY WAS SUCH AS IT APPEARED TO BE FROM THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT ANOTHER NEW SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION SHOULD BE APPOINTED
4484-34489-0038 TO INVESTIGATE THE DEPLORABLE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES FROM THE ONE POLITICAL TWO ADMINISTRATIVE
4484-34489-0039 FOUR ETHNOGRAPHICAL FIVE MATERIAL AND SIX RELIGIOUS POINTS OF VIEW THIRDLY THAT EVIDENCE SHOULD BE REQUIRED FROM THE RIVAL DEPARTMENT
4484-34489-0040 OF THE MEASURES THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS BY THAT DEPARTMENT FOR AVERTING THE DISASTROUS CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE NATIVE TRIBES WERE NOW PLACED AND FOURTHLY AND FINALLY THAT THAT DEPARTMENT EXPLAIN
4484-34489-0041 WHY IT HAD AS APPEARED FROM THE EVIDENCE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE
4484-34489-0042 FROM DECEMBER FIFTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE AND JUNE SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR
4484-34489-0043 A FLASH OF EAGERNESS SUFFUSED THE FACE OF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH AS HE RAPIDLY WROTE OUT A SYNOPSIS OF THESE IDEAS FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT HAVING FILLED A SHEET OF PAPER HE GOT UP
4484-34489-0044 RANG AND SENT A NOTE TO THE CHIEF SECRETARY OF HIS DEPARTMENT TO LOOK UP CERTAIN NECESSARY FACTS FOR HIM GETTING UP AND WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM HE GLANCED AGAIN AT THE PORTRAIT FROWNED AND SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY
4484-34489-0045 AFTER READING A LITTLE MORE OF THE BOOK ON EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS AND RENEWING HIS INTEREST IN IT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH WENT TO BED AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
