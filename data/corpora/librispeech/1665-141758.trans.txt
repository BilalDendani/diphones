1665-141758-0000 ALL KEPT AWAKE A LONG TIME THAT NIGHT IS HE REALLY TO BE MY HUSBAND THIS STRANGER WHO IS SO KIND YES KIND THAT IS THE CHIEF THING
1665-141758-0001 THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY AND FEAR WHICH SHE HAD SELDOM EXPERIENCED CAME UPON HER SHE FEARED TO LOOK ROUND
1665-141758-0002 BLACK EYEBROWS AND RED LIPS SHE RANG FOR HER MAID AND ASKED HER TO SLEEP IN HER ROOM
1665-141758-0003 WALKED UP AND DOWN THE CONSERVATORY FOR A LONG TIME THAT EVENING VAINLY EXPECTING SOMEONE NOW SMILING AT SOMEONE
1665-141758-0004 REBUKING HER FOR HER FALL THE LITTLE PRINCESS GRUMBLED TO HER MAID THAT HER BED WAS BADLY MADE SHE COULD NOT LIE EITHER ON HER FACE OR ON HER SIDE
1665-141758-0005 AND HER BURDEN OPPRESSED HER NOW MORE THAN EVER BECAUSE ANATOLE'S PRESENCE HAD VIVIDLY RECALLED TO HER THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS NOT LIKE THAT AND WHEN EVERYTHING WAS LIGHT AND GAY
1665-141758-0006 I TOLD YOU IT WAS ALL LUMPS AND HOLES THE LITTLE PRINCESS REPEATED I SHOULD BE GLAD ENOUGH TO FALL ASLEEP SO IT'S NOT MY FAULT AND HER VOICE QUIVERED LIKE THAT OF A CHILD ABOUT TO CRY
1665-141758-0007 THE OLD PRINCE DID NOT SLEEP EITHER
1665-141758-0008 HE KEPT TELLING HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER THE WHOLE MATTER AND DECIDE WHAT WAS RIGHT AND HOW HE SHOULD ACT BUT INSTEAD OF THAT HE ONLY EXCITED HIMSELF MORE AND MORE
1665-141758-0009 THE FIRST MAN THAT TURNS UP SHE FORGETS HER FATHER AND EVERYTHING ELSE
1665-141758-0010 NO SHE HAS NO PRIDE BUT I'LL LET HER SEE THE OLD PRINCE KNEW THAT IF HE TOLD HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS MAKING A MISTAKE
1665-141758-0011 PRINCESS MARY'S SELF ESTEEM WOULD BE WOUNDED AND HIS POINT NOT TO BE PARTED FROM HER WOULD BE GAINED SO PACIFYING HIMSELF WITH THIS THOUGHT HE CALLED TIKHON AND BEGAN TO UNDRESS
1665-141758-0012 WHAT DEVIL BROUGHT THEM HERE THOUGHT HE
1665-141758-0013 I NEVER INVITED THEM THEY CAME TO DISTURB MY LIFE AND THERE IS NOT MUCH OF IT LEFT
1665-141758-0014 GONE TO BED ASKED THE PRINCE
1665-141758-0015 THEY HAVE GONE TO BED AND PUT OUT THEIR LIGHTS YOUR EXCELLENCY NO GOOD NO GOOD SAID THE PRINCE RAPIDLY AND THRUSTING HIS FEET INTO HIS SLIPPERS AND HIS ARMS INTO THE SLEEVES OF HIS DRESSING GOWN HE WENT TO THE COUCH ON WHICH HE SLEPT
1665-141758-0016 UP TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE PAUVRE MERE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY HAD MUCH TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER IN PRIVATE AND SO THEY HAD BEEN SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY SINCE MORNING TO MEET ONE ANOTHER ALONE
1665-141758-0017 WHEN PRINCESS MARY WENT TO HER FATHER'S ROOM AT THE USUAL HOUR
1665-141758-0018 IT SEEMED TO HER THAT NOT ONLY DID EVERYBODY KNOW THAT HER FATE WOULD BE DECIDED THAT DAY BUT THAT THEY ALSO KNEW WHAT SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT SHE READ THIS IN TIKHON'S FACE
1665-141758-0019 AND IN THAT OF PRINCE VASILI'S VALET WHO MADE HER A LOW BOW WHEN SHE MET HIM IN THE CORRIDOR CARRYING HOT WATER THE OLD PRINCE WAS VERY AFFECTIONATE AND CAREFUL IN HIS TREATMENT OF HIS DAUGHTER THAT MORNING
1665-141758-0020 THE SAME WORDS SEVERAL TIMES OVER HE CAME TO THE POINT AT ONCE TREATING HER CEREMONIOUSLY I HAVE HAD A PROPOSITION MADE ME CONCERNING YOU HE SAID WITH AN UNNATURAL SMILE
1665-141758-0021 I EXPECT YOU HAVE GUESSED THAT PRINCE VASILI HAS NOT COME AND BROUGHT HIS PUPIL WITH HIM
1665-141758-0022 LAST NIGHT A PROPOSITION WAS MADE ME ON YOUR ACCOUNT AND AS YOU KNOW MY PRINCIPLES
1665-141758-0023 HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU MON PERE SAID THE PRINCESS GROWING PALE AND THEN BLUSHING HOW UNDERSTAND ME CRIED HER FATHER ANGRILY
1665-141758-0024 PRINCE VASILI FINDS YOU TO HIS TASTE AS A DAUGHTER IN LAW AND MAKES A PROPOSAL TO YOU ON HIS PUPIL'S BEHALF THAT'S HOW IT'S TO BE UNDERSTOOD HOW UNDERSTAND IT AND I ASK YOU
1665-141758-0025 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU THINK FATHER WHISPERED THE PRINCESS I I WHAT OF ME LEAVE ME OUT OF THE QUESTION I'M NOT GOING TO GET MARRIED WHAT
1665-141758-0026 THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW THE PRINCESS SAW THAT HER FATHER REGARDED THE MATTER WITH DISAPPROVAL BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HER THAT HER FATE WOULD BE DECIDED NOW OR NEVER
1665-141758-0027 SHE LOWERED HER EYES SO AS NOT TO SEE THE GAZE UNDER WHICH SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT THINK BUT WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO SUBMIT FROM HABIT AND SHE SAID I WISH ONLY TO DO YOUR WILL
1665-141758-0028 BUT IF I HAD TO EXPRESS MY OWN DESIRE SHE HAD NO TIME TO FINISH THE OLD PRINCE INTERRUPTED HER THAT'S ADMIRABLE HE SHOUTED
1665-141758-0029 THE PRINCE STOPPED HE SAW THE EFFECT THESE WORDS HAD PRODUCED ON HIS DAUGHTER SHE LOWERED HER HEAD AND WAS READY TO BURST INTO TEARS NOW THEN NOW THEN I'M ONLY JOKING HE SAID
1665-141758-0030 REMEMBER THIS PRINCESS I HOLD TO THE PRINCIPLE THAT A MAIDEN HAS A FULL RIGHT TO CHOOSE I GIVE YOU FREEDOM ONLY REMEMBER THAT YOUR LIFE'S HAPPINESS DEPENDS ON YOUR DECISION NEVER MIND ME BUT I DO NOT KNOW FATHER
1665-141758-0031 THERE'S NO NEED TO TALK
1665-141758-0032 BUT YOU ARE FREE TO CHOOSE GO TO YOUR ROOM THINK IT OVER AND COME BACK IN AN HOUR AND TELL ME IN HIS PRESENCE YES OR NO I KNOW YOU WILL PRAY OVER IT WELL PRAY IF YOU LIKE BUT YOU HAD BETTER THINK IT OVER
1665-141758-0033 GO YES OR NO YES OR NO YES OR NO HE STILL SHOUTED WHEN THE PRINCESS AS IF LOST IN A FOG HAD ALREADY STAGGERED OUT OF THE STUDY HER FATE WAS DECIDED AND HAPPILY DECIDED
1665-141758-0034 IT WAS UNTRUE TO BE SURE BUT STILL IT WAS TERRIBLE AND SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF IT SHE WAS GOING STRAIGHT ON THROUGH THE CONSERVATORY NEITHER SEEING NOR HEARING ANYTHING
1665-141758-0035 SHE RAISED HER EYES AND TWO STEPS AWAY SAW ANATOLE EMBRACING THE FRENCHWOMAN AND WHISPERING SOMETHING TO HER WITH A HORRIFIED EXPRESSION ON HIS HANDSOME FACE ANATOLE LOOKED AT PRINCESS MARY
1665-141758-0036 ANATOLE'S FACE SEEMED TO SAY
1665-141758-0037 IN SILENCE SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT
1665-141758-0038 AS IF INVITING HER TO JOIN IN A LAUGH AT THIS STRANGE INCIDENT AND THEN SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS WENT TO THE DOOR THAT LED TO HIS OWN APARTMENTS AN HOUR LATER TIKHON CAME TO CALL PRINCESS MARY TO THE OLD PRINCE
1665-141758-0039 HE ADDED THAT PRINCE VASILI WAS ALSO THERE
1665-141758-0040 AND GENTLY STROKING HER HAIR
1665-141758-0041 SAID PRINCESS MARY AND I WILL TRY TO DO ALL I CAN FOR YOUR HAPPINESS BUT YOU DESPISE ME
1665-141758-0042 OH ONLY MY POOR MOTHER I QUITE UNDERSTAND ANSWERED PRINCESS MARY WITH A SAD SMILE CALM YOURSELF MY DEAR I WILL GO TO MY FATHER SHE SAID AND WENT OUT
1665-141758-0043 PRINCE VASILI WITH ONE LEG THROWN HIGH OVER THE OTHER AND A SNUFFBOX IN HIS HAND WAS SITTING THERE WITH A SMILE OF DEEP EMOTION ON HIS FACE AS IF STIRRED TO HIS HEART'S CORE AND HIMSELF REGRETTING AND LAUGHING AT HIS OWN SENSIBILITY
1665-141758-0044 WHEN PRINCESS MARY ENTERED HE HURRIEDLY TOOK A PINCH OF SNUFF AH MY DEAR MY DEAR HE BEGAN RISING AND TAKING HER BY BOTH HANDS THEN SIGHING HE ADDED MY SON'S FATE IS IN YOUR HANDS

1665-141758-0048 I DON'T WISH TO MARRY SHE ANSWERED POSITIVELY GLANCING AT PRINCE VASILI AND AT HER FATHER WITH HER BEAUTIFUL EYES
1665-141758-0049 CRIED PRINCE BOLKONSKI FROWNING AND TAKING HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND HE DID NOT KISS HER BUT ONLY BENDING HIS FOREHEAD TO HERS JUST TOUCHED IT AND PRESSED HER HAND SO THAT SHE WINCED AND UTTERED A CRY PRINCE VASILI ROSE
