4854-24731-0000 GOD OR SUBSTANCE CONSISTING OF INFINITE ATTRIBUTES OF WHICH EACH EXPRESSES ETERNAL AND INFINITE ESSENTIALITY NECESSARILY EXISTS PROOF IF THIS BE DENIED CONCEIVE IF POSSIBLE
4854-24731-0001 THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST THEN HIS ESSENCE DOES NOT INVOLVE EXISTENCE
4854-24731-0002 IS ABSURD THEREFORE GOD NECESSARILY EXISTS ANOTHER PROOF OF EVERYTHING WHATSOEVER A CAUSE OR REASON MUST BE ASSIGNED EITHER FOR ITS EXISTENCE OR FOR ITS NON EXISTENCE
4854-24731-0003 A REASON OR CAUSE MUST BE GRANTED FOR ITS EXISTENCE IF ON THE CONTRARY IT DOES NOT EXIST A CAUSE MUST ALSO BE GRANTED WHICH PREVENTS IT FROM EXISTING OR ANNULS ITS EXISTENCE
4854-24731-0004 THIS REASON OR CAUSE MUST EITHER BE CONTAINED IN THE NATURE OF THE THING IN QUESTION OR BE EXTERNAL TO IT FOR INSTANCE THE REASON FOR THE NON EXISTENCE OF A SQUARE CIRCLE IS INDICATED IN ITS NATURE NAMELY
4854-24731-0005 BECAUSE IT WOULD INVOLVE A CONTRADICTION ON THE OTHER HAND THE EXISTENCE OF SUBSTANCE FOLLOWS ALSO SOLELY FROM ITS NATURE
4854-24731-0006 FROM THE LATTER IT MUST FOLLOW EITHER THAT A TRIANGLE NECESSARILY EXISTS OR THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT SHOULD EXIST SO MUCH IS SELF EVIDENT
4854-24731-0007 IT FOLLOWS THEREFROM THAT A THING NECESSARILY EXISTS IF NO CAUSE OR REASON BE GRANTED WHICH PREVENTS ITS EXISTENCE IF THEN NO CAUSE OR REASON CAN BE GIVEN WHICH PREVENTS THE EXISTENCE OF GOD
4854-24731-0008 DRAWN FROM ANOTHER SUBSTANCE OF ANOTHER NATURE FOR IF IT WERE OF THE SAME NATURE GOD BY THAT VERY FACT WOULD BE ADMITTED TO EXIST BUT SUBSTANCE OF ANOTHER NATURE COULD HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH GOD
4854-24731-0009 AND THEREFORE WOULD BE UNABLE EITHER TO CAUSE OR TO DESTROY HIS EXISTENCE AS THEN
4854-24731-0010 SUCH CAUSE MUST PERFORCE IF GOD DOES NOT EXIST BE DRAWN FROM GOD'S OWN NATURE WHICH WOULD INVOLVE A CONTRADICTION TO MAKE SUCH AN AFFIRMATION ABOUT A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE AND SUPREMELY PERFECT IS ABSURD
4854-24731-0011 ANOTHER PROOF THE POTENTIALITY OF NON EXISTENCE IS A NEGATION OF POWER AND CONTRARIWISE THE POTENTIALITY OF EXISTENCE IS A POWER AS IS OBVIOUS IF THEN
4854-24731-0012 THAT WHICH NECESSARILY EXISTS IS NOTHING BUT FINITE BEINGS SUCH FINITE BEINGS ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY ABSURD THEREFORE EITHER NOTHING EXISTS
4854-24731-0013 OR ELSE A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE NECESSARILY EXISTS ALSO NOW WE EXIST EITHER IN OURSELVES OR IN SOMETHING ELSE WHICH NECESSARILY EXISTS
4854-24731-0014 THEREFORE A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE IN OTHER WORDS GOD
4854-24731-0015 NOTE IN THIS LAST PROOF I HAVE PURPOSELY SHOWN GOD'S EXISTENCE A POSTERIORI SO THAT THE PROOF MIGHT BE MORE EASILY FOLLOWED NOT BECAUSE FROM THE SAME PREMISES GOD'S EXISTENCE DOES NOT FOLLOW A PRIORI
4854-24731-0016 FOR AS THE POTENTIALITY OF EXISTENCE IS A POWER IT FOLLOWS THAT IN PROPORTION AS REALITY INCREASES IN THE NATURE OF A THING SO ALSO WILL IT INCREASE ITS STRENGTH FOR EXISTENCE
4854-24731-0017 QUICKLY COME INTO EXISTENCE QUICKLY ALSO DISAPPEAR WHEREAS THEY REGARD AS MORE DIFFICULT OF ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT IS NOT SO EASILY BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE THOSE THINGS WHICH THEY CONCEIVE AS MORE COMPLICATED
4854-24731-0018 HOWEVER TO DO AWAY WITH THIS MISCONCEPTION I NEED NOT HERE SHOW THE MEASURE OF TRUTH IN THE PROVERB WHAT COMES QUICKLY GOES QUICKLY NOR DISCUSS WHETHER FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF UNIVERSAL NATURE
4854-24731-0019 ALL THINGS ARE EQUALLY EASY OR OTHERWISE I NEED ONLY REMARK THAT I AM NOT HERE SPEAKING OF THINGS WHICH COME TO PASS THROUGH CAUSES EXTERNAL TO THEMSELVES
4854-24731-0020 CANNOT BE PRODUCED BY ANY EXTERNAL CAUSE THINGS WHICH ARE PRODUCED BY EXTERNAL CAUSES WHETHER THEY CONSIST OF MANY PARTS OR FEW OWE WHATSOEVER PERFECTION OR REALITY THEY POSSESS SOLELY TO THE EFFICACY OF THEIR EXTERNAL CAUSE
4854-24731-0021 WHEREFORE THE EXISTENCE OF SUBSTANCE MUST ARISE SOLELY FROM ITS OWN NATURE WHICH IS NOTHING ELSE BUT ITS ESSENCE
4854-24731-0022 WE CANNOT BE MORE CERTAIN OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANYTHING THAN OF THE EXISTENCE OF A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE OR PERFECT THAT IS OF GOD
4854-24731-0023 AND INVOLVES ABSOLUTE PERFECTION ALL CAUSE FOR DOUBT CONCERNING HIS EXISTENCE IS DONE AWAY AND THE UTMOST CERTAINTY ON THE QUESTION IS GIVEN THIS I THINK WILL BE EVIDENT TO EVERY MODERATELY ATTENTIVE READER
4854-24731-0024 PROOF THE PARTS INTO WHICH SUBSTANCE AS THUS CONCEIVED WOULD BE DIVIDED EITHER WILL RETAIN THE NATURE OF SUBSTANCE OR THEY WILL NOT
4854-24731-0025 WILL PERFORCE CONSIST OF A DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTE SO THAT IN THAT CASE
4854-24731-0026 WOULD HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THEIR WHOLE
4854-24731-0027 COULD BOTH EXIST AND BE CONCEIVED WITHOUT ITS PARTS WHICH EVERYONE WILL ADMIT TO BE ABSURD IF WE ADOPT THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE NAMELY THAT THE PARTS WILL NOT RETAIN THE NATURE OF SUBSTANCE THEN
4854-24731-0028 IF THE WHOLE SUBSTANCE WERE DIVIDED INTO EQUAL PARTS
4854-24731-0029 SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY INFINITE IS INDIVISIBLE PROOF IF IT COULD BE DIVIDED THE PARTS INTO WHICH IT WAS DIVIDED WOULD EITHER RETAIN THE NATURE OF ABSOLUTELY INFINITE SUBSTANCE OR THEY WOULD NOT
4854-24731-0030 IF THE FORMER WE SHOULD HAVE SEVERAL SUBSTANCES OF THE SAME NATURE
4854-24731-0031 SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY INFINITE COULD CEASE TO EXIST
4854-24731-0032 IS ALSO ABSURD COROLLARY IT FOLLOWS THAT NO SUBSTANCE AND CONSEQUENTLY NO EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IN SO FAR AS IT IS SUBSTANCE IS DIVISIBLE NOTE
4854-24731-0033 THE INDIVISIBILITY OF SUBSTANCE MAY BE MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD AS FOLLOWS THE NATURE OF SUBSTANCE CAN ONLY BE CONCEIVED AS INFINITE AND BY A PART OF SUBSTANCE NOTHING ELSE CAN BE UNDERSTOOD THAN FINITE SUBSTANCE
4854-24731-0034 PROOF AS GOD IS A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE OF WHOM NO ATTRIBUTE THAT EXPRESSES THE ESSENCE OF SUBSTANCE CAN BE DENIED
4854-24731-0035 IF ANY SUBSTANCE BESIDES GOD WERE GRANTED IT WOULD HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED BY SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD AND THUS TWO SUBSTANCES WITH THE SAME ATTRIBUTE WOULD EXIST
4854-24731-0036 IS ABSURD THEREFORE BESIDES GOD NO SUBSTANCE CAN BE GRANTED OR CONSEQUENTLY BE CONCEIVED IF IT COULD BE CONCEIVED IT WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE CONCEIVED AS EXISTENT
4854-24731-0037 BUT THIS BY THE FIRST PART OF THIS PROOF IS ABSURD THEREFORE BESIDES GOD NO SUBSTANCE CAN BE GRANTED OR CONCEIVED
4854-24731-0038 ONLY ONE SUBSTANCE CAN BE GRANTED IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT SUBSTANCE IS ABSOLUTELY INFINITE AS WE HAVE ALREADY INDICATED
4854-24731-0039 TWO THAT EXTENSION AND THOUGHT ARE EITHER ATTRIBUTES OF GOD
4854-24731-0040 PROOF BESIDES GOD
4854-24731-0041 NOTHING WHICH IS IN ITSELF AND IS CONCEIVED THROUGH ITSELF
4854-24731-0042 CAN NEITHER BE NOR BE CONCEIVED WITHOUT SUBSTANCE WHEREFORE THEY CAN ONLY BE IN THE DIVINE NATURE AND CAN ONLY THROUGH IT BE CONCEIVED
4854-24731-0043 WITHOUT GOD NOTHING CAN BE OR BE CONCEIVED
4854-24731-0044 NOTE SOME ASSERT THAT GOD LIKE A MAN CONSISTS OF BODY AND MIND AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF PASSIONS
4854-24731-0045 HOW FAR SUCH PERSONS HAVE STRAYED FROM THE TRUTH IS SUFFICIENTLY EVIDENT FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BUT THESE I PASS OVER FOR ALL WHO HAVE IN ANYWISE REFLECTED ON THE DIVINE NATURE DENY THAT GOD HAS A BODY
4854-24731-0046 OF THIS THEY FIND EXCELLENT PROOF IN THE FACT THAT WE UNDERSTAND BY BODY A DEFINITE QUANTITY SO LONG SO BROAD SO DEEP BOUNDED BY A CERTAIN SHAPE
4854-24731-0047 AND IT IS THE HEIGHT OF ABSURDITY TO PREDICATE SUCH A THING OF GOD A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE BUT MEANWHILE BY OTHER REASONS WITH WHICH THEY TRY TO PROVE THEIR POINT
4854-24731-0048 THEY SHOW THAT THEY THINK CORPOREAL OR EXTENDED SUBSTANCE WHOLLY APART FROM THE DIVINE NATURE AND SAY IT WAS CREATED BY GOD WHEREFROM THE DIVINE NATURE CAN HAVE BEEN CREATED THEY ARE WHOLLY IGNORANT
4854-24731-0049 THUS THEY CLEARLY SHOW THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF THEIR OWN WORDS I MYSELF HAVE PROVED SUFFICIENTLY CLEARLY AT ANY RATE IN MY OWN JUDGMENT
4854-24731-0050 THAT NO SUBSTANCE CAN BE PRODUCED OR CREATED BY ANYTHING OTHER THAN ITSELF FURTHER
4854-24731-0051 THAT BESIDES GOD NO SUBSTANCE CAN BE GRANTED OR CONCEIVED HENCE WE DREW THE CONCLUSION THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IS ONE OF THE INFINITE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD HOWEVER IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN MORE FULLY
4854-24731-0052 I WILL REFUTE THE ARGUMENTS OF MY ADVERSARIES WHICH ALL START FROM THE FOLLOWING POINTS EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IN SO FAR AS IT IS SUBSTANCE CONSISTS AS THEY THINK IN PARTS WHEREFORE
4854-24731-0053 THEY DENY THAT IT CAN BE INFINITE OR CONSEQUENTLY THAT IT CAN APPERTAIN TO GOD THIS THEY ILLUSTRATE WITH MANY EXAMPLES OF WHICH I WILL TAKE ONE OR TWO IF EXTENDED SUBSTANCE THEY SAY IS INFINITE
4854-24731-0054 LET IT BE CONCEIVED TO BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS EACH PART WILL THEN BE EITHER FINITE OR INFINITE IF THE FORMER THEN INFINITE SUBSTANCE IS COMPOSED OF TWO FINITE PARTS WHICH IS ABSURD IF THE LATTER
4854-24731-0055 THEN ONE INFINITE WILL BE TWICE AS LARGE AS ANOTHER INFINITE WHICH IS ALSO ABSURD FURTHER IF AN INFINITE LINE BE MEASURED OUT IN FOOT LENGTHS IT WILL CONSIST OF AN INFINITE NUMBER OF SUCH PARTS
4854-24731-0056 IT WOULD EQUALLY CONSIST OF AN INFINITE NUMBER OF PARTS IF EACH PART MEASURED ONLY AN INCH THEREFORE ONE INFINITY WOULD BE TWELVE TIMES AS GREAT AS THE OTHER LASTLY
4854-24731-0057 IF FROM A SINGLE POINT THERE BE CONCEIVED TO BE DRAWN TWO DIVERGING LINES WHICH AT FIRST ARE AT A DEFINITE DISTANCE APART BUT ARE PRODUCED TO INFINITY IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO LINES WILL BE CONTINUALLY INCREASED
4854-24731-0058 UNTIL AT LENGTH IT CHANGES FROM DEFINITE TO INDEFINABLE AS THESE ABSURDITIES FOLLOW IT IS SAID FROM CONSIDERING QUANTITY AS INFINITE
4854-24731-0059 THE CONCLUSION IS DRAWN THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE MUST NECESSARILY BE FINITE AND CONSEQUENTLY CANNOT APPERTAIN TO THE NATURE OF GOD THE SECOND ARGUMENT IS ALSO DRAWN FROM GOD'S SUPREME PERFECTION
4854-24731-0060 CANNOT BE PASSIVE BUT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE INSOFAR AS IT IS DIVISIBLE IS PASSIVE IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE DOES NOT APPERTAIN TO THE ESSENCE OF GOD
4854-24731-0061 SUCH ARE THE ARGUMENTS I FIND ON THE SUBJECT IN WRITERS WHO BY THEM TRY TO PROVE THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IS UNWORTHY OF THE DIVINE NATURE
4854-24731-0062 HOWEVER I THINK AN ATTENTIVE READER WILL SEE THAT I HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED THEIR PROPOSITIONS FOR ALL THEIR ARGUMENTS ARE FOUNDED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IS COMPOSED OF PARTS AND SUCH A HYPOTHESIS I HAVE SHOWN
4854-24731-0063 MOREOVER ANYONE WHO REFLECTS WILL SEE THAT ALL THESE ABSURDITIES IF ABSURDITIES THEY BE WHICH I AM NOT NOW DISCUSSING FROM WHICH IT IS SOUGHT TO EXTRACT THE CONCLUSION THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IS FINITE DO NOT
4854-24731-0064 AT ALL FOLLOW FROM THE NOTION OF AN INFINITE QUANTITY BUT MERELY FROM THE NOTION THAT AN INFINITE QUANTITY IS MEASURABLE AND COMPOSED OF FINITE PARTS THEREFORE THE ONLY FAIR CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN IS THAT INFINITE QUANTITY
4854-24731-0065 IS NOT MEASURABLE AND CANNOT BE COMPOSED OF FINITE PARTS
4854-24731-0066 IF FROM THIS ABSURDITY OF THEIRS THEY PERSIST IN DRAWING THE CONCLUSION THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE MUST BE FINITE THEY WILL IN GOOD SOOTH BE ACTING LIKE A MAN WHO ASSERTS THAT CIRCLES HAVE THE PROPERTIES OF SQUARES
4854-24731-0067 AND FINDING HIMSELF THEREBY LANDED IN ABSURDITIES PROCEEDS TO DENY THAT CIRCLES HAVE ANY CENTER FROM WHICH ALL LINES DRAWN TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE ARE EQUAL
4854-24731-0068 FOR TAKING EXTENDED SUBSTANCE WHICH CAN ONLY BE CONCEIVED AS INFINITE ONE AND INDIVISIBLE
4854-24731-0069 THAT IT IS FINITE THAT IT IS COMPOSED OF FINITE PARTS AND THAT IT CAN BE MULTIPLIED AND DIVIDED SO ALSO OTHERS AFTER ASSERTING THAT A LINE IS COMPOSED OF POINTS CAN PRODUCE MANY ARGUMENTS TO PROVE THAT A LINE CANNOT BE INFINITELY DIVIDED
4854-24731-0070 ASSUREDLY IT IS NOT LESS ABSURD TO ASSERT THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IS MADE UP OF BODIES OR PARTS THAN IT WOULD BE TO ASSERT THAT A SOLID IS MADE UP OF SURFACES A SURFACE OF LINES AND A LINE OF POINTS
4854-24731-0071 THIS MUST BE ADMITTED BY ALL WHO KNOW CLEAR REASON TO BE INFALLIBLE AND MOST OF ALL BY THOSE WHO DENY THE POSSIBILITY OF A VACUUM FOR IF EXTENDED SUBSTANCE COULD BE SO DIVIDED THAT ITS PARTS WERE REALLY SEPARATE
4854-24731-0072 THE OTHERS REMAINING JOINED TOGETHER AS BEFORE AND WHY SHOULD ALL BE SO FITTED INTO ONE ANOTHER AS TO LEAVE NO VACUUM SURELY IN THE CASE OF THINGS WHICH ARE REALLY DISTINCT ONE FROM THE OTHER
4854-24731-0073 IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS THAT THE PARTS CANNOT REALLY BE DISTINGUISHED AND THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IN SO FAR AS IT IS SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DIVIDED IF ANYONE ASKS ME THE FURTHER QUESTION WHY ARE WE NATURALLY SO PRONE
4854-24731-0074 TO DIVIDE QUANTITY I ANSWER THAT QUANTITY IS CONCEIVED BY US IN TWO WAYS IN THE ABSTRACT AND SUPERFICIALLY AS WE IMAGINE IT OR AS SUBSTANCE AS WE CONCEIVE IT SOLELY BY THE INTELLECT IF THEN
4854-24731-0075 WE REGARD QUANTITY AS IT IS REPRESENTED IN OUR IMAGINATION WHICH WE OFTEN AND MORE EASILY DO WE SHALL FIND THAT IT IS FINITE DIVISIBLE AND COMPOUNDED OF PARTS BUT IF WE REGARD IT AS IT IS REPRESENTED IN OUR INTELLECT
4854-24731-0076 THIS WILL BE PLAIN ENOUGH TO ALL WHO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE INTELLECT AND THE IMAGINATION ESPECIALLY IF IT BE REMEMBERED THAT MATTER IS EVERYWHERE THE SAME THAT ITS PARTS ARE NOT DISTINGUISHABLE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS WE CONCEIVE MATTER AS DIVERSELY MODIFIED
4854-24731-0077 WHENCE ITS PARTS ARE DISTINGUISHED NOT REALLY BUT MODALLY FOR INSTANCE WATER IN SO FAR AS IT IS WATER WE CONCEIVE TO BE DIVIDED AND ITS PARTS TO BE SEPARATED ONE FROM THE OTHER
4854-24731-0078 BUT NOT IN SO FAR AS IT IS EXTENDED SUBSTANCE FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW IT IS NEITHER SEPARATED NOR DIVISIBLE FURTHER WATER IN SO FAR AS IT IS WATER IS PRODUCED AND CORRUPTED
4854-24731-0079 I THINK I HAVE NOW ANSWERED THE SECOND ARGUMENT IT IS IN FACT FOUNDED ON THE SAME ASSUMPTION AS THE FIRST NAMELY THAT MATTER IN SO FAR AS IT IS SUBSTANCE IS DIVISIBLE AND COMPOSED OF PARTS EVEN IF IT WERE SO
4854-24731-0080 NO SUBSTANCE CAN BE GRANTED WHEREFROM IT COULD RECEIVE ITS MODIFICATIONS ALL THINGS I REPEAT ARE IN GOD AND ALL THINGS WHICH COME TO PASS COME TO PASS SOLELY THROUGH THE LAWS OF THE INFINITE NATURE OF GOD
4854-24731-0081 AND FOLLOW AS I WILL SHORTLY SHOW FROM THE NECESSITY OF HIS ESSENCE WHEREFORE
4854-24731-0082 THAT GOD IS PASSIVE IN RESPECT TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIMSELF OR THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IS UNWORTHY OF THE DIVINE NATURE EVEN IF IT BE SUPPOSED DIVISIBLE SO LONG AS IT IS GRANTED TO BE INFINITE AND ETERNAL
