7276-90847-0007 OVER DALE TO THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN
7276-90847-0008 MARIANNA FOLLOWED HER TO THE HAMLET AND FOUND IN A WRETCHED HUT LYING ON A WRETCHED BED A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PEASANT GIRL DYING OF A FEVER SO MARIANNA TOUCHED THE GIRL WITH THE WATER OF HEALING AND IN AN INSTANT SHE BECAME WELL AND STRONG DEAR LADY SAID THE PEASANT GIRL
7276-90847-0009 BEHELD A LITTLE YELLOW BIRD CROUCHING ON THE HEARTHSTONE EVERY NOW AND THEN HE HID HIS HEAD UNDER HIS WINGS AND CRIED UNHAPPILY
7276-90847-0010 BENDING DOWN AND TAKING HIM UP IN HER HANDS WHY CRIEST THOU SO MOURNFULLY WHO HATH DONE THEE HARM BUT THE BIRD UTTERED ONLY A FORLORN LITTLE CRY AND HID HIS HEAD AGAIN UNDER HIS WINGS
7276-90847-0011 I FOUND HIM ON THE ROCKS AT THE MOUNTAINTOP YESTERDAY SAID THE MOTHER SOMEONE HAS WOUNDED HIM
7276-90847-0012 THEN THE PEASANT GIRL THREW OPEN THE CASEMENT AND THE YELLOW BIRD FLEW OUT INTO THE STREAMING SUN HE IS GONE FOREVER SAID THE PEASANT GIRL NAY
7276-90847-0013 AND PERCHED IN THE SHELTERING BOWER OF MARIANNA'S ARMS THEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE PEASANT GIRL AND THE YELLOW BIRD WHO FLEW SINGING BEFORE HER
7276-90847-0014 WHEN THEY REACHED THE FOOT OF THE PATH THE PEASANT GIRL CRIED FAREWELL DEAR MARIANNA MAY IT SOME DAY BE MINE TO REPAY THEE INTO THE WORLD AGAIN WENT MARIANNA AND WITH HER WENT THE YELLOW BIRD PRESENTLY SHE CAME TO THE FAIREST LAND WHICH SHE HAD EVER SEEN
7276-90847-0015 BECAUSE HER FATHER HAD BEEN THE LAST RIGHTFUL KING NOW
7276-90847-0016 WHO HAD STOLEN THE KINGDOM FROM MARIANNA'S FATHER HAD DIED LEAVING HIS BROTHER GARABIN IN CHARGE OF THE KINGDOM AND OF THE INTERESTS OF HIS LITTLE SON PRINCE DESIRE
7276-90847-0017 FOR SOME TIME HE HAD ENJOYED UNDISTURBED THE POSSESSION OF HIS STOLEN THRONE BUT AS DESIRE GREW TALLER AND STRONGER EVERY YEAR GARABIN BEGAN TO FEAR THE DAY WHEN HE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO RESIGN IN FAVOR OF HIS NEPHEW WHEN THE PRINCE REACHED HIS TWENTIETH YEAR
7276-90847-0018 GARABIN WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE KILLED HIM OPENLY HAD HE DARED BUT FEARING THE PEOPLE HE RESOLVED TO USE SECRET METHODS AND BRIBED A CRUEL MAGICIAN TO AFFLICT POOR DESIRE WITH A DEADLY AND MYSTERIOUS MALADY OF THIS MALADY
7276-90847-0019 DESIRE WAS SLOWLY DYING FOR NO MEDICINE COULD CURE HIM OR EVEN GIVE HIM ANY RELIEF FROM HIS CONSTANT PAIN
7276-90847-0020 IN THE HOPE OF FINDING HIS NEPHEW DEAD WOULD GO TO THE SICK ROOM AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT HIS WICKED HEART REJOICED WHEN HE FOUND THE PRINCE WEAKER AND MORE FEVERISH GARABIN HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A VISIT TO THE PRINCE WHO WAS RAPIDLY FAILING
7276-90847-0021 WHEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE CASTLE GUARD CAME TO HIM
7276-90847-0022 THE LITTLE YELLOW BIRD SAT ON MARIANNA'S SHOULDER AND NEVER DID MAIDEN APPEAR LOVELIER OR MORE GENTLE SCARCELY HAD GARABIN SET EYES ON MARIANNA
7276-90847-0023 HAD HE NOT BEEN VERY OLD AND CRAFTY HE WOULD HAVE STARTED FROM HIS GOLDEN THRONE FOR HE KNEW THAT THE LITTLE GOLDEN HEART SET WITH DIAMONDS
7276-90847-0024 WHAT WAS HE TO DO WITH MARIANNA WHOSE RIGHT TO THE THRONE WAS SUPERIOR EVEN TO HIS NEPHEW'S PERPLEXED AND WITH FEAR IN HIS HEART THE KING SOUGHT THE CRUEL MAGICIAN WHO HAD CAST THE SPELL ON DESIRE
7276-90847-0025 GREAT CAULDRON ALL THE WHILE AND SAID DO NOT FEAR I WILL DESTROY BOTH CLAIMANTS TO THE THRONE AT ONCE GARABIN RUBBED HIS HANDS TOGETHER WITH GLEE TO NIGHT
7276-90847-0026 AND THE PRINCE WILL DIE
7276-90847-0027 THINKING THAT NOBODY HAD NOTICED HIM THE YELLOW BIRD HOWEVER HAD SEEN EVERYTHING
7276-90847-0028 THE NEXT MORNING MARIANNA WAS ONCE MORE LED BEFORE THE KING WELCOME THRICE WELCOME LOVELY MAIDEN SAID GARABIN WITH THE MOST
7276-90847-0029 DREADFUL HYPOCRISY I HAVE LONG HOPED THAT YOU WOULD TURN YOUR FOOTSTEPS HITHER FOR MY POOR DEAR NEPHEW PRINCE DESIRE ONLY SON OF THE LATE KING
7276-90847-0030 DESIRE LAY IN A GREAT OLD FASHIONED BED HIS FACE FLUSHED WITH FEVER SO WEAK WAS THE POOR PRINCE THAT HE COULD SCARCELY LIFT HIS HEAD TO LOOK AT HIS VISITORS
7276-90847-0031 A GREAT PITY SWEPT OVER MARIANNA'S HEART THE INSTANT SHE SAW HIM AS FOR DESIRE HE FELL MADLY IN LOVE WITH MARIANNA AT FIRST SIGHT NOW JUST AS MARIANNA BENT OVER THE PRINCE TO TOUCH HIS FOREHEAD WITH THE WATER OF HEALING
7276-90847-0032 NOTHING SEEMED CHANGED THE WATER WITHIN SEEMED AS PURE AND DIAMOND LIKE AS EVER SHE TOUCHED THE PRINCE WITH THE LIQUID ALAS IN A MOMENT SO TERRIBLE WAS THE MAGICIAN'S POISON THAT THE PRINCE TURNED WHITE AS THE DRIVEN SNOW
7276-90847-0033 AT HIGH NOON A TRIAL WAS HELD AND SINCE THE DOCTORS DECLARED THAT THE PRINCE WAS DYING MARIANNA WAS CONDEMNED TO BE THROWN FROM THE PRECIPICE WHEN SOMEBODY ASKED ABOUT THE YELLOW BIRD
7276-90847-0034 GARABIN LAUGHED AND GAVE ORDERS THAT THE COOK SHOULD WRING ITS NECK AND TOSS IT TO THE CAT
7276-90847-0035 AND GIVEN TO THE COOK HERE YOU WRING ITS NECK SAID THE COOK TO ONE OF HER HELPERS WHILE I GO CALL THE CAT BY GREAT GOOD FORTUNE THE COOK'S HELPER
7276-90847-0036 LET IT FLY OUT OF THE WINDOW THE YELLOW BIRD FLEW TO THE WINDOW OF THE MAGICIAN'S ROOM THE MAGICIAN WAS IN THE CHAMBER STIRRING THE GIANT CAULDRON THE BIRD FLEW TO THE WINDOW OF PRINCE DESIRE'S ROOM AND SAW THAT HE WAS STILL INSENSIBLE
7276-90847-0037 AND LAST OF ALL A LITTLE GROUP IN WHICH WERE GARABIN THE MAGICIAN
7276-90847-0038 IT ROUSED THE PRINCE FROM HIS SWOON AND WITH HIS LAST MEASURE OF STRENGTH POOR DESIRE DRAGGED HIMSELF TO THE WINDOW THE PROCESSION WAS THEN PASSING DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE WINDOW AND DESIRE'S EYES
7276-90847-0039 MET THE EYES OF MARIANNA STOP STOP CRIED THE POOR PRINCE WILDLY I FORBID AN INSTANT LATER HE SANK FAINTING TO THE FLOOR THE PROCESSION WENT ON MEANWHILE THE YELLOW BIRD HAD RETURNED TO THE MAGICIAN'S CHAMBER IT WAS EMPTY
7276-90847-0040 CLUTCHING IT IN HIS CLAWS THE BIRD FLEW ONCE MORE TO THE PRINCE'S ROOM DESIRE STILL LAY IN A HEAP BY THE WINDOW
7276-90847-0041 THE PRINCE SPRANG UP STRONG AS A LION
7276-90847-0042 HE ARRIVED AT THE CLIFF JUST AS THE POOR MAIDEN WAS ABOUT TO BE PUSHED OFF INTO SPACE AND STANDING BY HER SIDE DARED ANYONE TO LAY HANDS UPON HER GARABIN SEEING HIS PRECIOUS PLOT MISCARRY GREW MAD WITH RAGE SEIZE THEM CRIED HE
7276-90847-0043 AND TOSS THEM BOTH OVER THE PRECIPICE SO THE SOLDIERS RUSHED AT MARIANNA AND THE PRINCE INTENDING TO CARRY OUT THEIR WICKED MASTER'S ORDERS BUT EVEN AS THEY DID SO THERE CAME A FLASH OF FLAME AND THE LITTLE DWARF MARIANNA'S FOSTER FATHER TOOK HIS PLACE BESIDE THE LOVERS
7276-90847-0044 THE FIRST ONE BLOWING THE KING AND THE MAGICIAN HEAD OVER HEELS OVER THE PRECIPICE THE SECOND CARRYING AWAY THE SOLDIERS AND THE THIRD THE RASCALLY FAVORITES
7276-90847-0045 AND IT IS THANKS TO HIM THAT I HAVE RETURNED IN TIME WITH THE STORM AT MY HEELS YOU MARIANNA ARE THE RIGHTFUL QUEEN OF THIS COUNTRY DEAR QUEEN SAID THE HONEST AND GALLANT DESIRE LET ME BE THE FIRST OF YOUR SUBJECTS TO SALUTE YOU AND HE KNELT BEFORE HER AND HUMBLY KISSED HER HAND NAY PRINCE SAID THE YOUNG QUEEN
