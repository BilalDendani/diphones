7988-113322-0000 PARIS THE FRENCH CAPITAL THE INDIFFERENCE AND HARSH OPPRESSION OF THE COURT AND THE NOBLES TOWARD THE POOR
7988-113322-0001 DAY BY DAY AND DAY BY DAY THE LATTER HAD GROWN MORE SULLEN AND RESENTFUL ALL THE WHILE THE DOWNTRODDEN PEOPLE OF PARIS WERE PLOTTING SECRETLY TO RISE IN REBELLION KILL THE KING AND QUEEN AND ALL THE NOBLES
7988-113322-0002 SEIZE THEIR RICHES AND GOVERN FRANCE THEMSELVES
7988-113322-0003 THE VERY ROOM WHERE MISTER LORRY AND LUCIE HAD FOUND HER FATHER MAKING SHOES THEY KEPT A RECORD OF ALL ACTS OF CRUELTY TOWARD THE POOR COMMITTED BY THE NOBILITY DETERMINING THAT WHEN THEY THEMSELVES SHOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH
7988-113322-0004 THOSE THUS GUILTY SHOULD BE KILLED THEIR FINE HOUSES BURNED AND ALL THEIR DESCENDANTS PUT TO DEATH SO THAT NOT EVEN THEIR NAMES SHOULD REMAIN IN FRANCE THIS WAS A WICKED AND AWFUL DETERMINATION
7988-113322-0005 BUT THESE POOR WRETCHED PEOPLE HAD BEEN MADE TO SUFFER ALL THEIR LIVES AND THEIR PARENTS BEFORE THEM AND CENTURIES OF OPPRESSION HAD KILLED ALL THEIR PITY AND MADE THEM AS FIERCE AS WILD BEASTS THAT ONLY WAIT
7988-113322-0006 FOR THEIR CAGES TO BE OPENED TO DESTROY ALL IN THEIR PATH THEY WERE AFRAID OF COURSE TO KEEP ANY WRITTEN LIST OF PERSONS WHOM THEY HAD THUS CONDEMNED SO MADAME DEFARGE THE WIFE OF THE WINE SELLER
7988-113322-0007 USED TO KNIT THE NAMES IN FINE STITCHES INTO A LONG PIECE OF KNITTING THAT SHE SEEMED ALWAYS AT WORK ON MADAME DEFARGE WAS A STOUT WOMAN WITH BIG COARSE HANDS AND EYES THAT NEVER SEEMED TO LOOK AT ANY ONE YET SAW EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
7988-113322-0008 SHE WAS AS STRONG AS A MAN AND EVERY ONE WAS SOMEWHAT AFRAID OF HER SHE WAS EVEN CRUELER AND MORE RESOLUTE THAN HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD SIT KNITTING ALL DAY LONG IN THE DIRTY WINE SHOP WATCHING AND LISTENING AND KNITTING IN THE
7988-113322-0009 NAMES OF PEOPLE WHOM SHE HOPED SOON TO SEE KILLED ONE OF THE HATED NAMES THAT SHE KNITTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAS EVREMONDE THE LABORER WHO IN THE MADNESS OF HIS GRIEF FOR HIS DEAD CHILD
7988-113322-0010 DARNAY'S HARD HEARTED UNCLE
7988-113322-0011 AND BECAUSE OF THIS DEFARGE AND HIS WIFE AND THE OTHER PLOTTERS HAD CONDEMNED ALL OF THE NAME OF EVREMONDE TO DEATH MEANWHILE THE KING
7988-113322-0012 THE BITTER TAXES STILL WENT ON THE WINE SHOP OF DEFARGE LOOKED AS PEACEFUL AS EVER BUT THE MEN WHO DRANK THERE NOW WERE DREAMING OF MURDER AND REVENGE AND THE HALF STARVED WOMEN
7988-113322-0013 WERE SULLENLY WAITING WATCHING MADAME DEFARGE AS SHE SILENTLY KNITTED KNITTED INTO HER WORK NAMES OF THOSE WHOM THE PEOPLE HAD CONDEMNED TO DEATH WITHOUT MERCY ONE DAY
7988-113322-0014 THIS FRIGHTFUL HUMAN STORM WHICH FOR SO MANY YEARS HAD BEEN GATHERING IN FRANCE BURST OVER PARIS THE POOR PEOPLE ROSE BY THOUSANDS SEIZED WHATEVER WEAPONS THEY COULD GET GUNS AXES OR EVEN STONES OF THE STREET AND
7988-113322-0015 LED BY DEFARGE AND HIS TIGERISH WIFE SET OUT TO AVENGE THEIR WRONGS THEIR RAGE TURNED FIRST OF ALL AGAINST THE BASTILLE THE OLD STONE PRISON IN WHICH SO MANY OF THEIR KIND HAD DIED
7988-113322-0016 AND RELEASED THE PRISONERS AND WHEREVER THEY SAW ONE OF THE KING'S UNIFORMS THEY HANGED THE WEARER TO THE NEAREST LAMP POST
7988-113322-0017 IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A TIME WHEN PARIS'S STREETS WERE TO RUN WITH BLOOD WHEN ALL THE WORST PASSIONS OF THE PEOPLE WERE LOOSED AND WHEN THEY WENT MAD WITH THE JOY OF REVENGE THE STORM SPREAD OVER FRANCE
7988-113322-0018 TO THE VILLAGE WHERE STOOD THE GREAT CHATEAU OF THE EVREMONDE FAMILY AND THE PEASANTS SET FIRE TO IT AND BURNED IT TO THE GROUND AND GABELLE THE SERVANT WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN CHARGE BY DARNAY THE NEW
7988-113322-0019 MARQUIS DE SAINT EVREMONDE WHOM THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BUT YET HATED THEY SEIZED AND PUT IN PRISON
7988-113322-0020 THREW ALL WHO BORE NOBLE NAMES OR TITLES INTO DUNGEONS AND AS THEY HAD PLANNED SET UP A GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN DARNAY SAFE IN LONDON WITH LUCIE KNEW LITTLE AND THOUGHT LESS OF ALL THIS
7988-113322-0021 TILL HE RECEIVED A PITIFUL LETTER FROM GABELLE WHO EXPECTED EACH MORNING TO BE DRAGGED OUT TO BE KILLED TELLING OF THE PLIGHT INTO WHICH HIS FAITHFULNESS HAD BROUGHT HIM AND BESEECHING HIS MASTER'S AID THIS LETTER
7988-113322-0022 MADE DARNAY MOST UNEASY HE BLAMED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WAS HIS FAULT THAT GABELLE HAD BEEN LEFT SO LONG IN SUCH A DANGEROUS POST HE DID NOT FORGET THAT HIS OWN FAMILY THE EVREMONDES HAD BEEN GREATLY HATED
7988-113322-0023 BUT HE THOUGHT THE FACT THAT HE HIMSELF HAD REFUSED TO BE ONE OF THEM AND HAD GIVEN HIS SYMPATHY RATHER TO THE PEOPLE THEY OPPRESSED WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBTAIN GABELLE'S RELEASE
7988-113322-0024 TO GO HIMSELF TO PARIS HE KNEW THE VERY THOUGHT OF HIS GOING NOW THAT FRANCE WAS MAD WITH VIOLENCE WOULD FRIGHTEN LUCIE SO HE DETERMINED NOT TO TELL HER HE PACKED SOME CLOTHING HURRIEDLY
7988-113322-0025 AND LEFT SECRETLY SENDING A LETTER BACK TELLING HER WHERE AND WHY HE WAS GOING AND BY THE TIME SHE READ THIS HE WAS WELL ON HIS WAY FROM ENGLAND DARNAY HAD EXPECTED TO FIND NO TROUBLE IN HIS ERRAND AND LITTLE PERSONAL RISK IN HIS JOURNEY
7988-113322-0026 BUT AS SOON AS HE LANDED ON THE SHORES OF FRANCE HE DISCOVERED HIS MISTAKE HE HAD ONLY TO GIVE HIS REAL NAME THE MARQUIS DE SAINT EVREMONDE WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO IF HE WOULD HELP GABELLE
7988-113322-0027 AND THE TITLE WAS THE SIGNAL FOR RUDE THREATS AND ILL TREATMENT ONCE IN HE COULD NOT GO BACK AND HE FELT AS IF A MONSTROUS NET WERE CLOSING AROUND HIM AS INDEED IT WAS FROM WHICH THERE WAS NO ESCAPE
7988-113322-0028 HE WAS SENT ON TO PARIS UNDER A GUARD OF SOLDIERS AND THERE HE WAS AT ONCE PUT INTO PRISON TO BE TRIED AND IN ALL PROBABILITY CONDEMNED TO DEATH AS ONE OF THE HATED NOBLE CLASS WHOM THE PEOPLE WERE NOW KILLING AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7988-113322-0029 THE GREAT ROOM OF THE PRISON TO WHICH HE WAS TAKEN DARNAY FOUND FULL OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MOST OF THEM RICH AND TITLED THE MEN CHATTING THE WOMEN READING OR DOING EMBROIDERY ALL COURTEOUS AND POLITE AS IF THEY SAT IN THEIR OWN SPLENDID HOMES
7988-113322-0030 INSTEAD OF IN A PRISON FROM WHICH MOST OF THEM
7988-113322-0031 THEN HE WAS TAKEN TO AN EMPTY CELL AND LEFT ALONE IT HAPPENED THAT THE BANK OF WHICH MISTER LORRY WAS AGENT HAD AN OFFICE ALSO IN PARIS AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD COME THERE ON BUSINESS THE DAY BEFORE DARNAY ARRIVED
7988-113322-0032 MISTER LORRY WAS AN ENGLISHMAN BORN AND FOR HIM THERE WAS NO DANGER HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE ARREST OF DARNAY UNTIL A DAY OR TWO LATER WHEN
7988-113322-0033 DOCTOR MANETTE AND LUCIE ENTERED JUST ARRIVED FROM LONDON DEEPLY AGITATED AND IN GREAT FEAR FOR DARNAY'S SAFETY AS SOON AS LUCIE HAD READ HER HUSBAND'S LETTER SHE HAD FOLLOWED AT ONCE WITH HER FATHER AND MISS PROSS DOCTOR MANETTE
7988-113322-0034 KNOWING DARNAY'S REAL NAME AND TITLE FOR BEFORE HE MARRIED LUCIE HE HAD TOLD HER FATHER EVERYTHING CONCERNING HIMSELF FEARED DANGER FOR HIM BUT HE HAD REASONED THAT HIS OWN LONG IMPRISONMENT IN THE BASTILLE
7988-113322-0035 THE BUILDING THE PEOPLE HAD FIRST DESTROYED WOULD MAKE HIM A FAVORITE AND RENDER HIM ABLE TO AID DARNAY IF DANGER CAME ON THE WAY THEY HAD HEARD THE SAD NEWS OF HIS ARREST AND HAD COME AT ONCE TO MISTER LORRY TO CONSIDER WHAT MIGHT BEST BE DONE
7988-113322-0036 WHILE THEY TALKED THROUGH THE WINDOW THEY SAW A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE COME RUSHING INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BUILDING TO SHARPEN WEAPONS AT A HUGE
7988-113322-0037 FEARFUL THAT HE WOULD BE TOO LATE TO SAVE DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE RUSHED TO THE YARD HIS WHITE HAIR STREAMING IN THE WIND AND TOLD THE LEADERS OF THE MOB WHO HE WAS HOW HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS IN THE BASTILLE
7988-113322-0038 AND THAT NOW ONE OF HIS KINDRED BY SOME UNKNOWN ERROR HAD BEEN SEIZED THEY CHEERED HIM LIFTED HIM ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND RUSHED AWAY TO DEMAND FOR HIM THE RELEASE OF DARNAY
7988-113322-0039 WAITED ALL NIGHT FOR TIDINGS BUT NONE CAME THAT NIGHT THE RESCUE HAD NOT PROVED EASY NEXT DAY DEFARGE THE WINE SHOP KEEPER BROUGHT A SHORT NOTE TO LUCIE FROM DARNAY AT THE PRISON
7988-113322-0040 HE HAD INDEED BY THE STORY OF HIS OWN SUFFERINGS SAVED DARNAY'S LIFE FOR THE TIME BEING BUT THE PRISONER HE HAD BEEN TOLD COULD NOT BE RELEASED WITHOUT TRIAL FOR THIS TRIAL THEY WAITED DAY AFTER DAY
7988-113322-0041 THE TIME PASSED SLOWLY AND TERRIBLY PRISONERS WERE NO LONGER MURDERED WITHOUT TRIAL BUT FEW ESCAPED THE DEATH PENALTY THE KING AND QUEEN WERE BEHEADED
7988-113322-0042 THOUSANDS WERE PUT TO DEATH MERELY ON SUSPICION AND THOUSANDS MORE WERE THROWN INTO PRISON TO AWAIT THEIR TURN THIS WAS THAT DREADFUL PERIOD WHICH HAS ALWAYS SINCE BEEN CALLED THE REIGN OF TERROR WHEN NO ONE FELT SURE OF HIS SAFETY
7988-113322-0043 THERE WAS A CERTAIN WINDOW IN THE PRISON THROUGH WHICH DARNAY SOMETIMES FOUND A CHANCE TO LOOK AND FROM WHICH HE COULD SEE ONE DINGY STREET CORNER ON THIS CORNER EVERY AFTERNOON LUCIE TOOK HER STATION FOR HOURS
7988-113322-0044 RAIN OR SHINE SHE NEVER MISSED A DAY AND THUS AT LONG INTERVALS HER HUSBAND GOT A VIEW OF HER
7988-113322-0045 ALL THE WHILE DOCTOR MANETTE
7988-113322-0046 AND AT LENGTH HIS TURN CAME TO BE TRIED AND HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE DRUNKEN IGNORANT MEN WHO CALLED THEMSELVES JUDGE AND JURY
7988-113322-0047 HE TOLD HOW HE HAD YEARS BEFORE RENOUNCED HIS FAMILY AND TITLE LEFT FRANCE AND SUPPORTED HIMSELF RATHER THAN BE A BURDEN ON THE PEASANTRY HE TOLD HOW HE HAD MARRIED A WOMAN OF FRENCH BIRTH THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE GOOD DOCTOR MANETTE
7988-113322-0048 WHOM ALL PARIS KNEW AND HAD COME TO PARIS NOW OF HIS OWN ACCORD TO HELP A POOR SERVANT WHO WAS IN DANGER THROUGH HIS FAULT THE STORY CAUGHT THE FANCY OF THE CHANGEABLE CROWD IN THE ROOM THEY CHEERED AND APPLAUDED IT
7988-113322-0049 AND PUT HIM IN A GREAT CHAIR AND CARRIED HIM HOME IN TRIUMPH TO LUCIE THERE WAS ONLY ONE THERE PERHAPS WHO DID NOT REJOICE AT THE RESULT AND THAT WAS THE COLD CRUEL WIFE OF THE WINE SELLER MADAME DEFARGE
