2588-11081-0022 SHE FELT EQUAL TO A WALK AND AFTER THEY HAD MADE SURE THAT MISSUS ASHE HAD ALL SHE NEEDED SHE AND AMY AND MABEL SET OFF BY THEMSELVES
2588-11081-0023 AND EVEN THE MORE MODERN STREETS HAD A NOVEL LOOK TO HER UNACCUSTOMED EYES AT FIRST THEY ONLY VENTURED A TIMID TURN OR TWO MARKING EACH CORNER AND GOING BACK NOW AND THEN TO REASSURE THEMSELVES BY A LOOK AT THE STATION BUT AFTER A WHILE
2588-11081-0024 GROWING BOLDER KATY VENTURED TO ASK A QUESTION OR TWO IN FRENCH AND WAS SURPRISED AND CHARMED TO FIND HERSELF UNDERSTOOD AFTER THAT SHE GREW ADVENTUROUS AND NO LONGER FEARFUL OF BEING LOST
2588-11081-0025 LED AMY STRAIGHT DOWN A LONG STREET LINED WITH SHOPS ALMOST ALL OF WHICH WERE FOR THE SALE OF ARTICLES IN IVORY
2588-11081-0026 THERE WERE CASES FULL WINDOWS FULL COUNTERS FULL OF THE MOST EXQUISITE COMBS AND BRUSHES SOME WITH ELABORATE MONOGRAMS IN SILVER AND COLORS OTHERS PLAIN THERE WERE BOXES AND CASKETS OF EVERY SIZE AND SHAPE

2588-11081-0030 AND SHE RESOLUTELY TURNED HER BACK ON THE IVORY ANGEL AND WALKED AWAY
2588-11081-0031 THE NEXT TURN BROUGHT THEM TO A GAY LOOKING LITTLE MARKET PLACE WHERE OLD WOMEN IN WHITE CAPS WERE SITTING ON THE GROUND BESIDE BASKETS AND PANNIERS FULL OF APPLES PEARS AND VARIOUS QUEER AND CURLY VEGETABLES NONE OF WHICH KATY RECOGNIZED AS FAMILIAR

2588-11081-0033 THE FACES OF THE WOMEN WERE BROWN AND WRINKLED THERE WERE NO PRETTY ONES AMONG THEM BUT THEIR BLACK EYES WERE FULL OF LIFE AND QUICKNESS AND THEIR FINGERS ONE AND ALL CLICKED WITH KNITTING NEEDLES AS THEIR TONGUES FLEW EQUALLY FAST IN THE CHATTER AND THE CHAFFER
2588-11081-0034 WHICH WENT ON WITHOUT STOP OR STAY THOUGH CUSTOMERS DID NOT SEEM TO BE MANY AND SALES WERE FEW RETURNING TO THE STATION THEY FOUND THAT MISSUS ASHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP DURING THEIR ABSENCE
2588-11081-0035 FOLLOWING A STAR IN THEIR CHOICE OF A HOTEL FOR HAVING NO BETTER ADVICE THEY HAD DECIDED UPON ONE OF THOSE THUS DISTINGUISHED IN BAEDEKER'S GUIDE BOOK THE STAR DID NOT BETRAY THEIR CONFIDENCE FOR THE

2588-11081-0037 MIGHT TO ALL APPEARANCES HAVE BEEN FURNISHED ABOUT THE TIME WHEN COLUMBUS CROSSED THE OCEAN BLUE BUT EVERYTHING WAS CLEAN AND HAD AN AIR OF OLD TIME RESPECTABILITY THE DINING ROOM WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY OF MORE MODERN BUILD
2588-11081-0038 WHOSE TINKLE AND PLASH BLENDED AGREEABLY WITH THE RATTLE OF THE KNIVES AND FORKS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED AND RAILED PLATFORM WHERE BEHIND A DESK SAT THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE BUSY WITH HER ACCOUNT BOOKS
2588-11081-0039 BUT KEEPING AN EYE THE WHILE ON ALL THAT WENT FORWARD MISSUS ASHE WALKED PAST THIS PERSONAGE WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE OF HER AS AMERICANS ARE WONT TO DO UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BUT PRESENTLY THE OBSERVANT KATY NOTICED THAT EVERY ONE ELSE
2588-11081-0040 AS THEY WENT IN OR OUT OF THE ROOM ADDRESSED A BOW OR A CIVIL REMARK TO THIS LADY
