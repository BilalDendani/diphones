3551-7894-0008 IT WAS INTO THE POWER OF WRETCHES SUCH AS THIS MAN THAT SHE HAD WILFULLY DELIVERED THE MAN SHE LOVED THIS BRUTISH CREATURE'S FAMILIARITY PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH TO HER OWN DEGRADATION BUT IT GAVE HER THE COURAGE TO CARRY THROUGH HER PURPOSE TO THE END YOU HAD MORE THAN ONE LOVER THEN

3551-7894-0012 NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS GOING ON NOT KNOWING WHAT TO THINK OR WHAT TO BELIEVE THEY HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF DEROULEDE'S PLANS FOR THE ESCAPE OF MARIE ANTOINETTE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE LETTER CASE HAD CONTAINED
3551-7894-0013 NOTHING SHE REPLIED NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING OF MY PRIVATE AFFAIRS OR OF MY PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE SAID JULIETTE COLDLY AS YOU SAY IT WAS A SPLENDID COMBINATION

3551-7894-0017 I HAVE SAID NO AND I MEAN NO
3551-7894-0018 JULIETTE WAS TOO PROUD TO INSIST ANY FURTHER SHE HAD HOPED BY ONE WORD TO SOFTEN MADAME DEROULEDE'S AND ANNE MIE'S HEART TOWARDS HER SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY BELIEVED THAT MISERABLE LIE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TELLING TO MERLIN
3551-7894-0019 BUT THAT ONE WORD WAS NOT TO BE SPOKEN SHE WOULD HAVE TO GO FORTH TO HER CERTAIN TRIAL TO HER PROBABLE DEATH
3551-7894-0020 SHE TURNED QUIETLY AND WALKED TOWARDS THE DOOR WHERE THE TWO MEN ALREADY STOOD AT ATTENTION
3551-7894-0021 THE CRIPPLED GIRL WAS FACE TO FACE WITH A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM WHICH IN ITSELF WAS FAR BEYOND HER COMPREHENSION BUT VAGUELY SHE FELT THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM SOMETHING IN JULIETTE'S FACE HAD ALREADY CAUSED HER TO BITTERLY REPENT HER ACTION TOWARDS HER
3551-7894-0022 AND NOW AS THIS BEAUTIFUL REFINED WOMAN WAS ABOUT TO PASS FROM UNDER THE SHELTER OF THIS ROOF TO THE CRUEL PUBLICITY AND TERRIBLE TORTURE OF THAT AWFUL REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL ANNE MIE'S WHOLE HEART WENT OUT TO HER IN BOUNDLESS SYMPATHY BEFORE MERLIN OR THE MEN COULD PREVENT HER
3551-7894-0023 AND WHISPERED IT WAS AN OATH I SWORE IT TO MY FATHER AND MY DEAD BROTHER TELL HIM
3551-7894-0024 BUT I'LL ATONE WITH MY LIFE TELL HIM WHISPERED JULIETTE NOW THEN SHOUTED MERLIN OUT OF THE WAY HUNCHBACK UNLESS YOU WANT TO COME ALONG TOO FORGIVE ME
3551-7894-0025 PETRONELLE TAKE CARE OF HER AND WITH A FIRM STEP SHE FOLLOWED THE SOLDIERS OUT OF THE ROOM PRESENTLY THE FRONT DOOR WAS HEARD TO OPEN THEN TO SHUT WITH A LOUD BANG
3551-7894-0026 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN IN THE LUXEMBOURG PRISON JULIETTE WAS ALONE AT LAST THAT IS TO SAY COMPARATIVELY ALONE FOR THERE WERE TOO MANY ARISTOCRATS TOO MANY CRIMINELS AND TRAITORS IN THE PRISONS OF PARIS NOW TO ALLOW OF ANY SECLUSION OF THOSE WHO WERE ABOUT TO BE TRIED
3551-7894-0027 CONDEMNED AND GUILLOTINED THE YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN MARCHED THROUGH THE CROWDED STREETS OF PARIS FOLLOWED BY A JEERING MOB WHO READILY RECOGNISED IN THE GENTLE HIGH BRED GIRL THE OBVIOUS PREY WHICH THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY WAS WONT FROM TIME TO TIME TO THROW TO THE HUNGRY HYDRA HEADED DOG OF THE REVOLUTION
3551-7894-0028 HAD HAD FEW OF THESE VERY WELCOME SIGHTS AN ARISTOCRAT A REAL ELEGANT REFINED WOMAN WITH WHITE HANDS AND PROUD PALE FACE
3551-7894-0029 MADAME GUILLOTINE WAS ABOVE ALL CATHOLIC IN HER TASTES HER GAUNT ARMS PAINTED BLOOD RED WERE OPEN ALIKE TO THE MURDERER AND THE THIEF THE ARISTOCRATS OF ANCIENT LINEAGE AND THE PROLETARIAT FROM THE GUTTER
3551-7894-0030 WHOM THEY HAD ROUSED FROM ONE SLAVERY IN ORDER TO THROW IT HEADLONG UNDER A TYRANNICAL YOKE MORE BRUTISH MORE ABSOLUTE THAN BEFORE THERE WERE TWELVE PRISONS IN PARIS THEN AND FORTY THOUSAND IN FRANCE AND THEY WERE ALL FULL
3551-7894-0031 AN ENTIRE ARMY WENT ROUND THE COUNTRY RECRUITING PRISONERS THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR SEPARATE CELLS NO ROOM FOR PRIVACY NO CAUSE OR DESIRE FOR THE MOST ELEMENTARY SENSE OF DELICACY WOMEN MEN CHILDREN ALL WERE HERDED TOGETHER
3551-7894-0032 FOR ONE DAY PERHAPS TWO AND A NIGHT OR SO
3551-7894-0033 THE SOLDIERS LAUGHED AND IMPROVED THE OCCASION WITH ANOTHER INSULTING JEST EVEN MERLIN FORGOT HIS VEXATION DELIGHTED AT THE INCIDENT BUT JULIETTE HAD SEEN NOTHING OF IT ALL SHE WAS WALKING AS IN A DREAM
3551-7894-0034 SHE DID NOT FEEL THE ROUGH HANDS OF THE SOLDIERS JOSTLING HER THROUGH THE CROWD
3551-7894-0035 WHERE SHE DWELT ALONE NOW WITH THE MAN SHE LOVED INSTEAD OF THE SQUALID HOUSES OF PARIS WITH THEIR ETERNAL DEVICE OF FRATERNITY AND EQUALITY THERE WERE BEAUTIFUL TREES AND SHRUBS OF LAUREL AND OF ROSES AROUND HER MAKING THE AIR FRAGRANT WITH THEIR SOFT INTOXICATING PERFUMES
3551-7894-0036 SWEET VOICES FROM THE LAND OF DREAMS FILLED THE ATMOSPHERE WITH THEIR TENDER MURMUR WHILST OVERHEAD A CLOUDLESS SKY ILLUMINED THIS EARTHLY PARADISE SHE WAS HAPPY SUPREMELY COMPLETELY HAPPY SHE HAD SAVED HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER OWN INIQUITOUS CRIME
3551-7894-0037 AND SHE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE HER LIFE FOR HIM SO THAT HIS SAFETY MIGHT BE MORE COMPLETELY ASSURED HER LOVE FOR HIM HE WOULD NEVER KNOW NOW HE KNEW ONLY HER CRIME BUT PRESENTLY WHEN SHE WOULD BE CONVICTED AND CONDEMNED CONFRONTED WITH A FEW SCRAPS OF BURNED PAPER AND A TORN LETTER CASE
3551-7894-0038 THEN HE WOULD KNOW THAT SHE HAD STOOD HER TRIAL SELF ACCUSED AND MEANT TO DIE FOR HIM
3551-7894-0039 IT WAS ETHEREAL AND PERHAPS NOT ALTOGETHER HUMAN BUT IT WAS HERS SHE HAD BEEN HIS DIVINITY HIS MADONNA HE HAD LOVED IN HER THAT WHICH WAS HER TRUER HER BETTER SELF WHAT WAS BASE IN HER WAS NOT TRULY HER
3551-7894-0040 THAT AWFUL OATH SWORN SO SOLEMNLY HAD BEEN HER RELENTLESS TYRANT AND HER RELIGION A RELIGION OF SUPERSTITION AND OF FALSE IDEALS HAD BLINDED HER AND DRAGGED HER INTO CRIME
3551-7894-0041 THAT THROUGH IT ALL SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN LOVE AND LEARNED ITS TENDER SECRETS WAS MORE THAN SHE DESERVED THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE FELT HIS BURNING KISSES ON HER HAND WAS HEAVENLY COMPENSATION FOR ALL SHE WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER AND SO SHE ALLOWED THEM TO DRAG HER THROUGH THE SANSCULOTTE MOB OF PARIS
3551-7894-0042 WHO WOULD HAVE TORN HER TO PIECES THEN AND THERE SO AS NOT TO DELAY THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER DIE THEY TOOK HER TO THE LUXEMBOURG ONCE THE PALACE OF THE MEDICI THE HOME OF PROUD MONSIEUR IN THE DAYS OF THE GREAT MONARCH NOW A LOATHSOME OVERFILLED PRISON IT WAS THEN SIX O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3551-7894-0043 DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY SHE WAS HANDED OVER TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE PRISON A SHORT THICK SET MAN IN BLACK TROUSERS AND BLACK SHAG WOOLLEN SHIRT
3551-7894-0044 HE EYED HER UP AND DOWN AS SHE PASSED UNDER THE NARROW DOORWAY
3551-7894-0045 YOU WILL BE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PRISONER TO THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY ANY VISITORS ALLOWED CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT THE SPECIAL PERMISSION OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR JULIETTE HEARD THIS BRIEF EXCHANGE OF WORDS OVER HER FUTURE FATE NO VISITOR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO SEE HER
3551-7894-0046 WELL PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE BEST SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO MEET DEROULEDE AGAIN AFRAID TO READ IN HIS EYES THAT STORY OF HIS DEAD LOVE WHICH ALONE MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED HER PRESENT HAPPINESS AND SHE WISHED TO SEE NO ONE SHE HAD A MEMORY TO DWELL ON A SHORT HEAVENLY MEMORY
3551-7894-0047 IT CONSISTED OF A FEW WORDS A KISS THE LAST ONE ON HER HAND AND THAT PASSIONATE MURMUR WHICH HAD ESCAPED FROM HIS LIPS WHEN HE KNELT AT HER FEET
