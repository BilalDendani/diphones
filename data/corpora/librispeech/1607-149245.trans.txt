1607-149245-0000 FROM THE BUSINESS OF PERSECUTING THE DALRYMPLE FAMILY TO THE IMPORTANT AND PRESSING QUESTION OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT THEY SAID THAT THE OLD SYSTEM HAD BEEN ABOLISHED THAT NO OTHER SYSTEM HAD BEEN SUBSTITUTED
1607-149245-0001 THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION OF THE KINGDOM AND THAT THE FIRST DUTY OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO PUT AN END TO AN ANARCHY WHICH WAS DAILY PRODUCING DISASTERS AND CRIMES
1607-149245-0002 THE LEADERS OF THE CLUB WERE NOT TO BE SO DRAWN AWAY FROM THEIR OBJECT IT WAS MOVED AND RESOLVED THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS SHOULD BE POSTPONED TILL SECULAR AFFAIRS HAD BEEN SETTLED
1607-149245-0003 THE UNJUST AND ABSURD ACT OF INCAPACITATION WAS CARRIED BY SEVENTY FOUR VOICES TO TWENTY FOUR ANOTHER VOTE STILL MORE OBVIOUSLY AIMED AT THE HOUSE OF STAIR SPEEDILY FOLLOWED
1607-149245-0004 THE PARLIAMENT LAID CLAIM TO A VETO ON THE NOMINATION OF THE JUDGES AND ASSUMED THE POWER OF STOPPING THE SIGNET IN OTHER WORDS OF SUSPENDING THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE TILL THIS CLAIM SHOULD BE ALLOWED
1607-149245-0005 IT WAS PLAIN FROM WHAT PASSED IN DEBATE THAT THOUGH THE CHIEFS OF THE CLUB HAD BEGUN WITH THE COURT OF SESSION THEY DID NOT MEAN TO END THERE THE ARGUMENTS USED BY SIR PATRICK HUME AND OTHERS
1607-149245-0006 LED DIRECTLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE KING OUGHT NOT TO HAVE THE APPOINTMENT OF ANY GREAT PUBLIC FUNCTIONARY SIR PATRICK INDEED AVOWED BOTH IN SPEECH AND IN WRITING HIS OPINION THAT THE WHOLE PATRONAGE OF THE REALM
1607-149245-0007 OUGHT TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE CROWN TO THE ESTATES WHEN THE PLACE OF TREASURER
1607-149245-0008 SO MUCH PROVOKED BY THEIR PERVERSENESS THAT AFTER LONG TEMPORISING HE REFUSED TO TOUCH EVEN ACTS WHICH WERE IN THEMSELVES UNOBJECTIONABLE AND TO WHICH HIS INSTRUCTIONS EMPOWERED HIM TO CONSENT
1607-149245-0009 THIS STATE OF THINGS WOULD HAVE ENDED IN SOME GREAT CONVULSION IF THE KING OF SCOTLAND HAD NOT BEEN ALSO KING OF A MUCH GREATER AND MORE OPULENT KINGDOM CHARLES THE FIRST HAD NEVER FOUND ANY PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER
1607-149245-0010 MORE UNMANAGEABLE THAN WILLIAM DURING THIS SESSION FOUND THE PARLIAMENT AT EDINBURGH BUT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF THE PARLIAMENT AT EDINBURGH TO PUT ON WILLIAM SUCH A PRESSURE AS THE PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER HAD PUT ON CHARLES
1607-149245-0011 A REFUSAL OF SUPPLIES AT WESTMINSTER WAS A SERIOUS THING AND LEFT THE SOVEREIGN NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO YIELD OR TO RAISE MONEY BY UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS BUT A REFUSAL OF SUPPLIES AT EDINBURGH
1607-149245-0012 REDUCED HIM TO NO SUCH DILEMMA THE LARGEST SUM THAT HE COULD HOPE TO RECEIVE FROM SCOTLAND IN A YEAR WAS LESS THAN WHAT HE RECEIVED FROM ENGLAND EVERY FORTNIGHT
1607-149245-0013 MORE DILIGENTLY CULTIVATED AND MORE THICKLY PEOPLED THAN THE GREATER PART OF THE HIGHLANDS THE MEN WHO FOLLOWED HIS BANNER WERE SUPPOSED TO BE NOT LESS NUMEROUS THAN ALL THE MACDONALDS AND MACLEANS UNITED
1607-149245-0014 AND WERE IN STRENGTH AND COURAGE INFERIOR TO NO TRIBE IN THE MOUNTAINS BUT THE CLAN HAD BEEN MADE INSIGNIFICANT BY THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHIEF THE MARQUESS WAS THE FALSEST THE MOST FICKLE
1607-149245-0015 THE MOST PUSILLANIMOUS OF MANKIND ALREADY IN THE SHORT SPACE OF SIX MONTHS HE HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES A JACOBITE AND SEVERAL TIMES A WILLIAMITE BOTH JACOBITES AND WILLIAMITES REGARDED HIM WITH CONTEMPT AND DISTRUST
1607-149245-0016 WHICH RESPECT FOR HIS IMMENSE POWER PREVENTED THEM FROM FULLY EXPRESSING AFTER REPEATEDLY VOWING FIDELITY TO BOTH PARTIES AND REPEATEDLY BETRAYING BOTH HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD BEST PROVIDE FOR HIS SAFETY
1607-149245-0017 BY ABDICATING THE FUNCTIONS BOTH OF A PEER AND OF A CHIEFTAIN BY ABSENTING HIMSELF BOTH FROM THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE AT EDINBURGH AND FROM HIS CASTLE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND BY QUITTING THE COUNTRY TO WHICH HE WAS BOUND BY EVERY TIE OF DUTY AND HONOUR
1607-149245-0018 FOR THEY HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BY HIM ONLY FOUR YEARS BEFORE AS THE MINISTERS OF HIS VENGEANCE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ARGYLE THEY HAD GARRISONED INVERARY THEY HAD RAVAGED LORN THEY HAD DEMOLISHED HOUSES CUT DOWN FRUIT TREES
1607-149245-0019 BURNED FISHING BOATS BROKEN MILLSTONES HANGED CAMPBELLS AND WERE THEREFORE NOT LIKELY TO BE PLEASED BY THE PROSPECT OF MAC CALLUM MORES RESTORATION ONE WORD FROM THE MARQUESS
1607-149245-0020 WOULD HAVE SENT TWO THOUSAND CLAYMORES TO THE JACOBITE SIDE BUT THAT WORD HE WOULD NOT SPEAK AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE CONDUCT OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAS AS IRRESOLUTE AND INCONSISTENT AS HIS OWN
1607-149245-0021 WHILE THEY WERE WAITING FOR SOME INDICATION OF HIS WISHES THEY WERE CALLED TO ARMS AT ONCE BY TWO LEADERS EITHER OF WHOM MIGHT WITH SOME SHOW OF REASON CLAIM TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ABSENT CHIEF
1607-149245-0022 LORD MURRAY THE MARQUESS'S ELDEST SON WHO WAS MARRIED TO A DAUGHTER OF THE DUKE OF HAMILTON DECLARED FOR KING WILLIAM STEWART OF BALLENACH THE MARQUESS'S CONFIDENTIAL AGENT
1607-149245-0023 DECLARED FOR KING JAMES THE PEOPLE KNEW NOT WHICH SUMMONS TO OBEY HE WHOSE AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD IN PROFOUND REVERENCE HAD PLIGHTED FAITH TO BOTH SIDES
1607-149245-0024 AND HAD THEN RUN AWAY FOR FEAR OF BEING UNDER THE NECESSITY OF JOINING EITHER NOR WAS IT VERY EASY TO SAY
1607-149245-0025 BELONGED TO HIS STEWARD OR TO HIS HEIR APPARENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY POST IN ATHOL WAS BLAIR CASTLE THE HOUSE WHICH NOW BEARS THAT NAME IS NOT DISTINGUISHED BY ANY STRIKING PECULIARITY
1607-149245-0026 FROM OTHER COUNTRY SEATS OF THE ARISTOCRACY THE OLD BUILDING WAS A LOFTY TOWER OF RUDE ARCHITECTURE
1607-149245-0027 THE WALLS WOULD HAVE OFFERED VERY LITTLE RESISTANCE TO A BATTERING TRAIN BUT WERE QUITE STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP THE HERDSMEN OF THE GRAMPIANS IN AWE ABOUT FIVE MILES SOUTH OF THIS STRONGHOLD
1607-149245-0028 OF KILLIECRANKIE AT PRESENT A HIGHWAY AS SMOOTH AS ANY ROAD IN MIDDLESEX
1607-149245-0029 WHITE VILLAS PEEP FROM THE BIRCH FOREST AND ON A FINE SUMMER DAY THERE IS SCARCELY A TURN OF THE PASS AT WHICH MAY NOT BE SEEN SOME ANGLER CASTING HIS FLY ON THE FOAM OF THE RIVER SOME ARTIST SKETCHING A PINNACLE OF ROCK
1607-149245-0030 OR SOME PARTY OF PLEASURE BANQUETING ON THE TURF IN THE FRETWORK OF SHADE AND SUNSHINE BUT IN THE DAYS OF WILLIAM THE THIRD KILLIECRANKIE WAS MENTIONED WITH HORROR BY THE PEACEFUL AND INDUSTRIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE PERTHSHIRE LOWLANDS
1607-149245-0031 IT WAS DEEMED THE MOST PERILOUS OF ALL THOSE DARK RAVINES THROUGH WHICH THE MARAUDERS OF THE HILLS WERE WONT TO SALLY FORTH THE SOUND SO MUSICAL TO MODERN EARS
1607-149245-0032 OF THE RIVER BRAWLING ROUND THE MOSSY ROCKS AND AMONG THE SMOOTH PEBBLES THE DARK MASSES OF CRAG AND VERDURE WORTHY OF THE PENCIL OF WILSON THE FANTASTIC PEAKS BATHED AT SUNRISE AND SUNSET
1607-149245-0033 SUGGESTED TO OUR ANCESTORS THOUGHTS OF MURDEROUS AMBUSCADES AND OF BODIES STRIPPED GASHED AND ABANDONED TO THE BIRDS OF PREY
1607-149245-0034 THAT THE WEAPONS BY WHICH THE HIGHLANDERS COULD BE MOST EFFECTUALLY SUBDUED WERE THE PICKAXE AND THE SPADE THE COUNTRY WHICH LAY JUST ABOVE THIS PASS WAS NOW THE THEATRE OF A WAR SUCH AS THE HIGHLANDS HAD NOT OFTEN WITNESSED
1607-149245-0035 MEN WEARING THE SAME TARTAN AND ATTACHED TO THE SAME LORD WERE ARRAYED AGAINST EACH OTHER THE NAME OF THE ABSENT CHIEF WAS USED WITH SOME SHOW OF REASON ON BOTH SIDES BALLENACH AT THE HEAD OF A BODY OF VASSALS
1607-149245-0036 WHO CONSIDERED HIM AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MARQUESS OCCUPIED BLAIR CASTLE MURRAY WITH TWELVE HUNDRED FOLLOWERS APPEARED BEFORE THE WALLS AND DEMANDED TO BE ADMITTED
1607-149245-0037 THAT THE CRISIS REQUIRED PROMPT AND STRENUOUS EXERTION ON THE FATE OF BLAIR CASTLE PROBABLY DEPENDED THE FATE OF ALL ATHOL ON THE FATE OF ATHOL MIGHT DEPEND THE FATE OF SCOTLAND MACKAY HASTENED NORTHWARD
1607-149245-0038 AND ORDERED HIS TROOPS TO ASSEMBLE IN THE LOW COUNTRY OF PERTHSHIRE SOME OF THEM WERE QUARTERED AT SUCH A DISTANCE THAT THEY DID NOT ARRIVE IN TIME
1607-149245-0039 WHICH HAD SERVED IN HOLLAND AND WHICH BORE THE NAMES OF THEIR COLONELS MACKAY HIMSELF BALFOUR AND RAMSAY THERE WAS ALSO A GALLANT REGIMENT OF INFANTRY FROM ENGLAND THEN CALLED HASTINGS'S BUT NOW KNOWN AS THE THIRTEENTH OF THE LINE
1607-149245-0040 ONE OF THEM WAS COMMANDED BY LORD KENMORE THE OTHER WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED ON THE BORDER AND WHICH IS STILL STYLED THE KING'S OWN BORDERERS BY LORD LEVEN TWO TROOPS OF HORSE LORD ANNANDALE'S AND LORD BELHAVEN'S
1607-149245-0041 PROBABLY MADE UP THE ARMY TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE THREE THOUSAND MEN
1607-149245-0042 BUT THE CALL WAS SO UNEXPECTED AND THE TIME ALLOWED WAS SO SHORT THAT THE MUSTER WAS NOT A VERY FULL ONE THE WHOLE NUMBER OF BROADSWORDS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN UNDER THREE THOUSAND
1607-149245-0043 WITH THIS FORCE SUCH AS IT WAS DUNDEE SET FORTH ON HIS MARCH HE WAS JOINED BY SUCCOURS WHICH HAD JUST ARRIVED FROM ULSTER THEY CONSISTED OF LITTLE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED IRISH FOOT
1607-149245-0044 INCOMPETENT AS HE WAS HE BORE A COMMISSION WHICH GAVE HIM MILITARY RANK IN SCOTLAND NEXT TO DUNDEE
