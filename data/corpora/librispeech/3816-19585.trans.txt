3816-19585-0000 BEFORE THE OLD QUESTION THAT HAD EXCITED MY CONJECTURES RECURRED TO MY MIND
3816-19585-0001 IT WAS A KIND OF FATAL IMPULSE THAT SEEMED DESTINED TO HURRY ME TO MY DESTRUCTION I DID NOT WONDER AT THE DISTURBANCE THAT WAS GIVEN TO MISTER FALKLAND BY ANY ALLUSION HOWEVER DISTANT TO THIS FATAL AFFAIR
3816-19585-0002 THAT WAS AS COMPLETELY ACCOUNTED FOR FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF HIS EXCESSIVE SENSIBILITY IN MATTERS OF HONOUR AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON THE SUPPOSITION OF THE MOST ATROCIOUS GUILT KNOWING AS HE DID
3816-19585-0003 THAT SUCH A CHARGE HAD ONCE BEEN CONNECTED WITH HIS NAME HE WOULD OF COURSE BE PERPETUALLY UNEASY
3816-19585-0004 HE WOULD DOUBT AND FEAR LEST EVERY MAN WITH WHOM HE CONVERSED HARBOURED THE FOULEST SUSPICION AGAINST HIM IN MY CASE HE FOUND THAT I WAS IN POSSESSION OF SOME INFORMATION MORE THAN HE WAS AWARE OF
3816-19585-0005 WITHOUT ITS BEING POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DECIDE TO WHAT IT AMOUNTED WHETHER I HAD HEARD A JUST OR UNJUST A CANDID OR CALUMNIATORY TALE
3816-19585-0006 HE HAD ALSO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT I GAVE ENTERTAINMENT TO THOUGHTS DEROGATORY TO HIS HONOUR AND THAT I DID NOT FORM THAT FAVOURABLE JUDGMENT WHICH THE EXQUISITE REFINEMENT OF HIS RULING PASSION MADE INDISPENSABLE TO HIS PEACE
3816-19585-0007 YET AS I HAVE SAID THE UNCERTAINTY AND RESTLESSNESS OF MY CONTEMPLATIONS WOULD BY NO MEANS DEPART FROM ME THE FLUCTUATING STATE OF MY MIND PRODUCED A CONTENTION OF OPPOSITE PRINCIPLES
3816-19585-0008 THAT BY TURNS USURPED DOMINION OVER MY CONDUCT SOMETIMES I WAS INFLUENCED BY THE MOST COMPLETE VENERATION FOR MY MASTER I PLACED AN UNRESERVED CONFIDENCE IN HIS INTEGRITY AND HIS VIRTUE
3816-19585-0009 AND IMPLICITLY SURRENDERED MY UNDERSTANDING FOR HIM TO SET IT TO WHAT POINT HE PLEASED AT OTHER TIMES THE CONFIDENCE WHICH HAD BEFORE FLOWED WITH THE MOST PLENTEOUS TIDE BEGAN TO EBB
3816-19585-0010 MISTER FALKLAND WHO WAS MOST PAINFULLY ALIVE TO EVERY THING THAT RELATED TO HIS HONOUR SAW THESE VARIATIONS AND BETRAYED HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEM NOW IN ONE MANNER AND NOW IN ANOTHER
3816-19585-0011 FREQUENTLY BEFORE I WAS MYSELF AWARE SOMETIMES ALMOST BEFORE THEY EXISTED THE SITUATION OF BOTH WAS DISTRESSING WE WERE EACH OF US A PLAGUE TO THE OTHER
3816-19585-0012 THERE WAS INDEED ONE EMINENT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS SHARE IN THE TRANSACTION AND MINE I HAD SOME CONSOLATION IN THE MIDST OF MY RESTLESSNESS CURIOSITY IS A PRINCIPLE THAT CARRIES ITS PLEASURES
3816-19585-0013 AS WELL AS ITS PAINS ALONG WITH IT THE MIND IS URGED BY A PERPETUAL STIMULUS IT SEEMS AS IF IT WERE CONTINUALLY APPROACHING TO THE END OF ITS RACE AND AS THE INSATIABLE DESIRE OF SATISFACTION IS ITS PRINCIPLE OF CONDUCT
3816-19585-0014 SO IT PROMISES ITSELF IN THAT SATISFACTION AN UNKNOWN GRATIFICATION WHICH SEEMS AS IF IT WERE CAPABLE OF FULLY COMPENSATING ANY INJURIES THAT MAY BE SUFFERED IN THE CAREER BUT TO MISTER FALKLAND
3816-19585-0015 THERE WAS NO CONSOLATION WHAT HE ENDURED IN THE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN US APPEARED TO BE GRATUITOUS EVIL HE HAD ONLY TO WISH THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON AS MYSELF IN THE WORLD
3816-19585-0016 AND TO CURSE THE HOUR WHEN HIS HUMANITY LED HIM TO RESCUE ME FROM MY OBSCURITY AND PLACE ME IN HIS SERVICE A CONSEQUENCE PRODUCED UPON ME BY THE EXTRAORDINARY NATURE OF MY SITUATION IT IS NECESSARY TO MENTION
3816-19585-0017 THE CONSTANT STATE OF VIGILANCE AND SUSPICION IN WHICH MY MIND WAS RETAINED WORKED A VERY RAPID CHANGE IN MY CHARACTER IT SEEMED TO HAVE ALL THE EFFECT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM YEARS OF OBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCE
3816-19585-0018 THE STRICTNESS WITH WHICH I ENDEAVOURED TO REMARK WHAT PASSED IN THE MIND OF ONE MAN AND THE VARIETY OF CONJECTURES INTO WHICH I WAS LED APPEARED AS IT WERE
3816-19585-0019 TO RENDER ME A COMPETENT ADEPT IN THE DIFFERENT MODES IN WHICH THE HUMAN INTELLECT DISPLAYS ITS SECRET WORKINGS I NO LONGER SAID TO MYSELF AS I HAD DONE IN THE BEGINNING I WILL ASK MISTER FALKLAND WHETHER HE WERE THE MURDERER
3816-19585-0020 SOONER OR LATER I SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT IF IT REALLY EXISTED BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE TO THINK ALMOST FOR A MOMENT OF THAT SIDE OF THE ALTERNATIVE AS TRUE
3816-19585-0021 AND WITH ALL MY UNGOVERNABLE SUSPICION ARISING FROM THE MYSTERIOUSNESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALL THE DELIGHT WHICH A YOUNG AND UNFLEDGED MIND RECEIVES FROM IDEAS THAT GIVE SCOPE TO ALL THAT IMAGINATION CAN PICTURE OF TERRIBLE OR SUBLIME
3816-19585-0022 I COULD NOT YET BRING MYSELF TO CONSIDER MISTER FALKLAND'S GUILT AS A SUPPOSITION ATTENDED WITH THE REMOTEST PROBABILITY I HOPE THE READER WILL FORGIVE ME FOR DWELLING THUS LONG ON PRELIMINARY CIRCUMSTANCES
3816-19585-0023 I SHALL COME SOON ENOUGH TO THE STORY OF MY OWN MISERY I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT ONE OF THE MOTIVES WHICH INDUCED ME TO THE PENNING OF THIS NARRATIVE WAS TO CONSOLE MYSELF IN MY INSUPPORTABLE DISTRESS
3816-19585-0024 MY ATTENTION IS CALLED OFF FOR A SHORT INTERVAL FROM THE HOPELESS MISFORTUNE IN WHICH I AM AT PRESENT INVOLVED THE MAN MUST INDEED POSSESS AN UNCOMMON PORTION OF HARDNESS OF HEART WHO CAN ENVY ME SO SLIGHT A RELIEF
3816-19585-0025 EITHER THE FACULTY OR THE COURT OF CHANCERY APPROPRIATE TO THE TERM BECAME STRONGER AND MORE DURABLE THAN EVER IT WAS NO LONGER PRACTICABLE WHOLLY TO CONCEAL THEM FROM THE FAMILY AND EVEN FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
3816-19585-0026 HE WOULD SOMETIMES WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS NOTICE ABSENT HIMSELF FROM HIS HOUSE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS UNACCOMPANIED BY SERVANT OR ATTENDANT
3816-19585-0027 THIS WAS THE MORE EXTRAORDINARY AS IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT HE PAID NO VISITS NOR KEPT UP ANY SORT OF INTERCOURSE WITH THE GENTLEMEN OF THE VICINITY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT A MAN OF MISTER FALKLAND'S DISTINCTION AND FORTUNE
3816-19585-0028 SHOULD LONG CONTINUE IN SUCH A PRACTICE WITHOUT ITS BEING DISCOVERED WHAT WAS BECOME OF HIM THOUGH A CONSIDERABLE PART OF OUR COUNTY WAS AMONG THE WILDEST AND MOST DESOLATE DISTRICTS THAT ARE TO BE FOUND IN SOUTH BRITAIN
3816-19585-0029 MISTER FALKLAND WAS SOMETIMES SEEN CLIMBING AMONG THE ROCKS RECLINING MOTIONLESS FOR HOURS TOGETHER UPON THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE OR LULLED INTO A KIND OF NAMELESS LETHARGY OF DESPAIR BY THE DASHING OF THE TORRENTS
3816-19585-0030 HE WOULD REMAIN FOR WHOLE NIGHTS TOGETHER UNDER THE NAKED COPE OF HEAVEN INATTENTIVE TO THE CONSIDERATION EITHER OF PLACE OR TIME INSENSIBLE TO THE VARIATIONS OF THE WEATHER
3816-19585-0031 OR RATHER SEEMING TO BE DELIGHTED WITH THAT UPROAR OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH PARTIALLY CALLED OFF HIS ATTENTION FROM THE DISCORD AND DEJECTION THAT OCCUPIED HIS OWN MIND
3816-19585-0032 AT FIRST WHEN WE RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE AT ANY TIME OF THE PLACE TO WHICH MISTER FALKLAND HAD WITHDRAWN HIMSELF SOME PERSON OF HIS HOUSEHOLD MISTER COLLINS OR MYSELF BUT MOST GENERALLY MYSELF
3816-19585-0033 AS I WAS ALWAYS AT HOME AND ALWAYS IN THE RECEIVED SENSE OF THE WORD AT LEISURE WENT TO HIM TO PERSUADE HIM TO RETURN BUT AFTER A FEW EXPERIMENTS WE THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO DESIST
3816-19585-0034 AND LEAVE HIM TO PROLONG HIS ABSENCE OR TO TERMINATE IT AS MIGHT HAPPEN TO SUIT HIS OWN INCLINATION MISTER COLLINS WHOSE GREY HAIRS AND LONG SERVICES
3816-19585-0035 SEEMED TO GIVE HIM A SORT OF RIGHT TO BE IMPORTUNATE SOMETIMES SUCCEEDED THOUGH EVEN IN THAT CASE THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD SIT MORE UNEASILY UPON MISTER FALKLAND THAN THIS INSINUATION AS IF HE WANTED A GUARDIAN TO TAKE CARE OF HIM
3816-19585-0036 OR AS IF HE WERE IN OR IN DANGER OF FALLING INTO A STATE IN WHICH HE WOULD BE INCAPABLE OF DELIBERATELY CONTROLLING HIS OWN WORDS AND ACTIONS AT ONE TIME HE WOULD SUDDENLY YIELD TO HIS HUMBLE VENERABLE FRIEND
3816-19585-0037 MURMURING GRIEVOUSLY AT THE CONSTRAINT THAT WAS PUT UPON HIM BUT WITHOUT SPIRIT ENOUGH EVEN TO COMPLAIN OF IT WITH ENERGY AT ANOTHER TIME EVEN THOUGH COMPLYING HE WOULD SUDDENLY BURST OUT IN A PAROXYSM OF RESENTMENT
3816-19585-0038 UPON THESE OCCASIONS THERE WAS SOMETHING INCONCEIVABLY SAVAGELY TERRIBLE IN HIS ANGER THAT GAVE TO THE PERSON AGAINST WHOM IT WAS DIRECTED THE MOST HUMILIATING AND INSUPPORTABLE SENSATIONS
3816-19585-0039 ME HE ALWAYS TREATED AT THESE TIMES WITH FIERCENESS AND DROVE ME FROM HIM WITH A VEHEMENCE LOFTY EMPHATICAL AND SUSTAINED BEYOND ANY THING OF WHICH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HUMAN NATURE TO BE CAPABLE
3816-19585-0040 THESE SALLIES SEEMED ALWAYS TO CONSTITUTE A SORT OF CRISIS IN HIS INDISPOSITION AND WHENEVER HE WAS INDUCED TO SUCH A PREMATURE RETURN HE WOULD FALL IMMEDIATELY AFTER INTO A STATE OF THE MOST MELANCHOLY INACTIVITY
3816-19585-0041 IN WHICH HE USUALLY CONTINUED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS IT WAS BY AN OBSTINATE FATALITY THAT WHENEVER I SAW MISTER FALKLAND IN THESE DEPLORABLE SITUATIONS
3816-19585-0042 AND PARTICULARLY WHEN I LIGHTED UPON HIM AFTER HAVING SOUGHT HIM AMONG THE ROCKS AND PRECIPICES PALE EMACIATED SOLITARY AND HAGGARD THE SUGGESTION WOULD CONTINUALLY RECUR TO ME
