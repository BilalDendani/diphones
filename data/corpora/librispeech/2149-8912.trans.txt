2149-8912-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO AT NINE O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING MELBURY DRESSED HIMSELF UP IN SHINING BROADCLOTH CREASED WITH FOLDING AND SMELLING OF CAMPHOR AND STARTED FOR HINTOCK HOUSE
2149-8912-0001 HE WAS THE MORE IMPELLED TO GO AT ONCE BY THE ABSENCE OF HIS SON IN LAW IN LONDON FOR A FEW DAYS TO ATTEND REALLY OR OSTENSIBLY SOME PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS HE SAID NOTHING OF HIS DESTINATION EITHER TO HIS WIFE OR TO GRACE
2149-8912-0002 FEARING THAT THEY MIGHT ENTREAT HIM TO ABANDON SO RISKY A PROJECT AND WENT OUT UNOBSERVED HE HAD CHOSEN HIS TIME WITH A VIEW AS HE SUPPOSED OF CONVENIENTLY CATCHING MISSUS CHARMOND WHEN SHE HAD JUST FINISHED HER BREAKFAST BEFORE ANY OTHER BUSINESS PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABOUT
2149-8912-0003 IF ANY CAME PLODDING THOUGHTFULLY ONWARD HE CROSSED A GLADE LYING BETWEEN LITTLE HINTOCK WOODS AND THE PLANTATION WHICH ABUTTED ON THE PARK AND THE SPOT BEING OPEN HE WAS DISCERNED THERE BY WINTERBORNE FROM THE COPSE ON THE NEXT HILL WHERE HE AND HIS MEN WERE WORKING
2149-8912-0004 KNOWING HIS MISSION THE YOUNGER MAN HASTENED DOWN FROM THE COPSE AND MANAGED TO INTERCEPT THE TIMBER MERCHANT I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF THIS SIR HE SAID AND I AM OF OPINION THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO PUT OFF YOUR VISIT FOR THE PRESENT
2149-8912-0005 BUT MELBURY WOULD NOT EVEN STOP TO HEAR HIM HIS MIND WAS MADE UP THE APPEAL WAS TO BE MADE AND WINTERBORNE STOOD AND WATCHED HIM SADLY TILL HE ENTERED THE SECOND PLANTATION AND DISAPPEARED
2149-8912-0006 MELBURY RANG AT THE TRADESMEN'S DOOR OF THE MANOR HOUSE AND WAS AT ONCE INFORMED THAT THE LADY WAS NOT YET VISIBLE AS INDEED HE MIGHT HAVE GUESSED HAD HE BEEN ANYBODY BUT THE MAN HE WAS MELBURY SAID HE WOULD WAIT WHEREUPON THE YOUNG MAN INFORMED HIM IN A NEIGHBORLY WAY THAT
2149-8912-0007 BETWEEN THEMSELVES SHE WAS IN BED AND ASLEEP NEVER MIND SAID MELBURY RETREATING INTO THE COURT I'LL STAND ABOUT HERE CHARGED SO FULLY WITH HIS MISSION HE SHRANK FROM CONTACT WITH ANYBODY
2149-8912-0008 BUT HE WALKED ABOUT THE PAVED COURT TILL HE WAS TIRED AND STILL NOBODY CAME TO HIM AT LAST HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND SAT DOWN IN A SMALL WAITING ROOM FROM WHICH HE GOT GLIMPSES OF THE KITCHEN CORRIDOR AND OF THE WHITE CAPPED MAIDS FLITTING JAUNTILY HITHER AND THITHER
2149-8912-0009 THEY HAD HEARD OF HIS ARRIVAL BUT HAD NOT SEEN HIM ENTER AND IMAGINING HIM STILL IN THE COURT DISCUSSED FREELY THE POSSIBLE REASON OF HIS CALLING THEY MARVELLED AT HIS TEMERITY FOR THOUGH MOST OF THE TONGUES WHICH HAD BEEN LET LOOSE ATTRIBUTED THE CHIEF BLAME WORTHINESS TO FITZPIERS
2149-8912-0010 THESE OF HER HOUSEHOLD PREFERRED TO REGARD THEIR MISTRESS AS THE DEEPER SINNER MELBURY SAT WITH HIS HANDS RESTING ON THE FAMILIAR KNOBBED THORN WALKING STICK WHOSE GROWING HE HAD SEEN BEFORE HE ENJOYED ITS USE
2149-8912-0011 THROUGH THIS VISION THE INCIDENTS OF THE MOMENT BUT GLEAMED CONFUSEDLY HERE AND THERE AS AN OUTER LANDSCAPE THROUGH THE HIGH COLORED SCENES OF A STAINED WINDOW HE WAITED THUS AN HOUR AN HOUR AND A HALF TWO HOURS
2149-8912-0012 HE BEGAN TO LOOK PALE AND ILL WHEREUPON THE BUTLER WHO CAME IN ASKED HIM TO HAVE A GLASS OF WINE MELBURY ROUSED HIMSELF AND SAID NO NO IS SHE ALMOST READY SHE IS JUST FINISHING BREAKFAST SAID THE BUTLER
2149-8912-0013 SHE WILL SOON SEE YOU NOW I AM JUST GOING UP TO TELL HER YOU ARE HERE WHAT HAVEN'T YOU TOLD HER BEFORE SAID MELBURY OH NO SAID THE OTHER YOU SEE YOU CAME SO VERY EARLY AT LAST THE BELL RANG MISSUS CHARMOND COULD SEE HIM
2149-8912-0014 SHE WAS NOT IN HER PRIVATE SITTING ROOM WHEN HE REACHED IT BUT IN A MINUTE HE HEARD HER COMING FROM THE FRONT STAIRCASE AND SHE ENTERED WHERE HE STOOD AT THIS TIME OF THE MORNING MISSUS CHARMOND LOOKED HER FULL AGE AND MORE SHE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR THE TYPICAL
2149-8912-0015 THERE BEING NO FIRE IN THE ROOM SHE CAME IN WITH A SHAWL THROWN LOOSELY ROUND HER SHOULDERS AND OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT THE LEAST SUSPICION THAT MELBURY HAD CALLED UPON ANY OTHER ERRAND THAN TIMBER
2149-8912-0016 FELICE WAS INDEED THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE PARISH WHO HAD NOT HEARD THE RUMOR OF HER OWN WEAKNESSES SHE WAS AT THIS MOMENT LIVING IN A FOOL'S PARADISE IN RESPECT OF THAT RUMOR THOUGH NOT IN RESPECT OF THE WEAKNESSES THEMSELVES WHICH IF THE TRUTH BE TOLD
2149-8912-0017 CAUSED HER GRAVE MISGIVINGS DO SIT DOWN MISTER MELBURY YOU HAVE FELLED ALL THE TREES THAT WERE TO BE PURCHASED BY YOU THIS SEASON EXCEPT THE OAKS I BELIEVE YES SAID MELBURY HOW VERY NICE
2149-8912-0018 IT MUST BE SO CHARMING TO WORK IN THE WOODS JUST NOW SHE WAS TOO CARELESS TO AFFECT AN INTEREST IN AN EXTRANEOUS PERSON'S AFFAIRS SO CONSUMMATELY AS TO DECEIVE IN THE MANNER OF THE PERFECT SOCIAL MACHINE HENCE HER WORDS VERY NICE SO CHARMING
2149-8912-0019 WERE UTTERED WITH A PERFUNCTORINESS THAT MADE THEM SOUND ABSURDLY UNREAL YES YES SAID MELBURY IN A REVERIE HE DID NOT TAKE A CHAIR AND SHE ALSO REMAINED STANDING RESTING UPON HIS STICK HE BEGAN MISSUS CHARMOND
2149-8912-0020 I HAVE CALLED UPON A MORE SERIOUS MATTER AT LEAST TO ME THAN TREE THROWING AND WHATEVER MISTAKES I MAKE IN MY MANNER OF SPEAKING UPON IT TO YOU MADAM DO ME THE JUSTICE TO SET EM DOWN TO MY WANT OF PRACTICE AND NOT TO MY WANT OF CARE
2149-8912-0021 MISSUS CHARMOND LOOKED ILL AT EASE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEGUN TO GUESS HIS MEANING BUT APART FROM THAT SHE HAD SUCH DREAD OF CONTACT WITH ANYTHING PAINFUL HARSH OR EVEN EARNEST THAT HIS PRELIMINARIES ALONE WERE ENOUGH TO DISTRESS HER YES WHAT IS IT
2149-8912-0022 SHE SAID I AM AN OLD MAN SAID MELBURY WHOM SOMEWHAT LATE IN LIFE GOD THOUGHT FIT TO BLESS WITH ONE CHILD AND SHE A DAUGHTER HER MOTHER WAS A VERY DEAR WIFE TO ME BUT SHE WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US WHEN THE CHILD WAS YOUNG
2149-8912-0023 AND THE CHILD BECAME PRECIOUS AS THE APPLE OF MY EYE TO ME FOR SHE WAS ALL I HAD LEFT TO LOVE FOR HER SAKE ENTIRELY I MARRIED AS SECOND WIFE A HOMESPUN WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN KIND AS A MOTHER TO HER IN DUE TIME THE QUESTION OF HER EDUCATION CAME ON AND I SAID
2149-8912-0024 I WILL EDUCATE THE MAID WELL IF I LIVE UPON BREAD TO DO IT OF HER POSSIBLE MARRIAGE I COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK FOR IT SEEMED LIKE A DEATH THAT SHE SHOULD CLEAVE TO ANOTHER MAN AND GROW TO THINK HIS HOUSE HER HOME RATHER THAN MINE
2149-8912-0025 BUT I SAW IT WAS THE LAW OF NATURE THAT THIS SHOULD BE AND THAT IT WAS FOR THE MAID'S HAPPINESS THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE A HOME WHEN I WAS GONE AND I MADE UP MY MIND WITHOUT A MURMUR TO HELP IT ON FOR HER SAKE
2149-8912-0026 AND TO MAKE AMENDS I DETERMINED TO GIVE HER MY MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION TO MY FRIEND'S SON SEEING THAT THEY LIKED EACH OTHER WELL THINGS CAME ABOUT WHICH MADE ME DOUBT IF IT WOULD BE FOR MY DAUGHTER'S HAPPINESS TO DO THIS INASMUCH AS THE YOUNG MAN WAS POOR
2149-8912-0027 AND SHE WAS DELICATELY REARED ANOTHER MAN CAME AND PAID COURT TO HER ONE HER EQUAL IN BREEDING AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN EVERY WAY IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE ONLY COULD GIVE HER THE HOME WHICH HER TRAINING HAD MADE A NECESSITY ALMOST
2149-8912-0028 I URGED HER ON AND SHE MARRIED HIM BUT MA'AM A FATAL MISTAKE WAS AT THE ROOT OF MY RECKONING I FOUND THAT THIS WELL BORN GENTLEMAN I HAD CALCULATED ON SO SURELY WAS NOT STANCH OF HEART AND THAT THEREIN LAY A DANGER OF GREAT SORROW FOR MY DAUGHTER
2149-8912-0029 MADAM HE SAW YOU AND YOU KNOW THE REST I HAVE COME TO MAKE NO DEMANDS TO UTTER NO THREATS I HAVE COME SIMPLY AS A FATHER IN GREAT GRIEF ABOUT THIS ONLY CHILD AND I BESEECH YOU TO DEAL KINDLY WITH MY DAUGHTER
2149-8912-0030 AND TO DO NOTHING WHICH CAN TURN HER HUSBAND'S HEART AWAY FROM HER FOREVER FORBID HIM YOUR PRESENCE MA'AM AND SPEAK TO HIM ON HIS DUTY AS ONE WITH YOUR POWER OVER HIM WELL CAN DO AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE RENT BETWEEN THEM MAY BE PATCHED UP
2149-8912-0031 FOR IT IS NOT AS IF YOU WOULD LOSE BY SO DOING YOUR COURSE IS FAR HIGHER THAN THE COURSES OF A SIMPLE PROFESSIONAL MAN AND THE GRATITUDE YOU WOULD WIN FROM ME AND MINE BY YOUR KINDNESS IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
2149-8912-0032 MISSUS CHARMOND HAD FIRST RUSHED INTO A MOOD OF INDIGNATION ON COMPREHENDING MELBURY'S STORY HOT AND COLD BY TURNS SHE HAD MURMURED LEAVE ME LEAVE ME BUT AS HE SEEMED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF THIS HIS WORDS BEGAN TO INFLUENCE HER
2149-8912-0033 AND WHEN HE CEASED SPEAKING SHE SAID WITH HURRIED HOT BREATH WHAT HAS LED YOU TO THINK THIS OF ME WHO SAYS I HAVE WON YOUR DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND AWAY FROM HER SOME MONSTROUS CALUMNIES ARE AFLOAT OF WHICH I HAVE KNOWN NOTHING UNTIL NOW MELBURY STARTED AND LOOKED AT HER SIMPLY
2149-8912-0034 BUT SURELY MA'AM YOU KNOW THE TRUTH BETTER THAN I HER FEATURES BECAME A LITTLE PINCHED AND THE TOUCHES OF POWDER ON HER HANDSOME FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWED THEMSELVES AS AN EXTRINSIC FILM WILL YOU LEAVE ME TO MYSELF SHE SAID
2149-8912-0035 WITH A FAINTNESS WHICH SUGGESTED A GUILTY CONSCIENCE THIS IS SO UTTERLY UNEXPECTED YOU OBTAIN ADMISSION TO MY PRESENCE BY MISREPRESENTATION AS GOD'S IN HEAVEN MA'AM THAT'S NOT TRUE I MADE NO PRETENCE AND I THOUGHT IN REASON YOU WOULD KNOW WHY I HAD COME
2149-8912-0036 THIS GOSSIP I HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF IT TELL ME OF IT I SAY TELL YOU MA'AM NOT I WHAT THE GOSSIP IS NO MATTER WHAT REALLY IS YOU KNOW
2149-8912-0037 BUT PARDON ME I SPEAK ROUGHLY AND I CAME TO SPEAK GENTLY TO COAX YOU BEG YOU TO BE MY DAUGHTER'S FRIEND SHE LOVED YOU ONCE MA'AM YOU BEGAN BY LIKING HER THEN YOU DROPPED HER WITHOUT A REASON AND IT HURT HER WARM HEART MORE THAN I CAN TELL YE
2149-8912-0038 BUT YOU WERE WITHIN YOUR RIGHT AS THE SUPERIOR NO DOUBT BUT IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER HER POSITION NOW SURELY SURELY YOU WOULD DO HER NO HARM CERTAINLY I WOULD DO HER NO HARM I MELBURY'S EYE MET HERS
2149-8912-0039 IT WAS CURIOUS BUT THE ALLUSION TO GRACE'S FORMER LOVE FOR HER SEEMED TO TOUCH HER MORE THAN ALL MELBURY'S OTHER ARGUMENTS OH MELBURY SHE BURST OUT YOU HAVE MADE ME SO UNHAPPY HOW COULD YOU COME TO ME LIKE THIS IT IS TOO DREADFUL NOW GO AWAY GO GO
2149-8912-0040 MINGLED WITH BETTER SENTIMENTS MISSUS CHARMOND'S MOBILE SPIRIT WAS SUBJECT TO THESE FIERCE PERIODS OF STRESS AND STORM SHE HAD NEVER SO CLEARLY PERCEIVED TILL NOW THAT HER SOUL
2149-8912-0041 WAS BEING SLOWLY INVADED BY A DELIRIUM WHICH HAD BROUGHT ABOUT ALL THIS THAT SHE WAS LOSING JUDGMENT AND DIGNITY UNDER IT BECOMING AN ANIMATED IMPULSE ONLY A PASSION INCARNATE A FASCINATION HAD LED HER ON IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN SEIZED BY A HAND OF VELVET
2149-8912-0042 AND THIS WAS WHERE SHE FOUND HERSELF OVERSHADOWED WITH SUDDEN NIGHT AS IF A TORNADO HAD PASSED BY WHILE SHE SAT OR RATHER CROUCHED UNHINGED BY THE INTERVIEW LUNCH TIME CAME AND THEN THE EARLY AFTERNOON ALMOST WITHOUT HER CONSCIOUSNESS
2149-8912-0043 THEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN WHO SAYS IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GIVE HIS NAME WAS SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED I CANNOT SEE HIM WHOEVER HE MAY BE I AM NOT AT HOME TO ANYBODY
