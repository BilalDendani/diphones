3959-706-0000 AN ONION GRUSHENKA LIVED IN THE BUSIEST PART OF THE TOWN NEAR THE CATHEDRAL SQUARE IN A SMALL WOODEN LODGE IN THE COURTYARD BELONGING TO THE HOUSE OF THE WIDOW MOROZOV THE HOUSE WAS A LARGE STONE BUILDING OF TWO STORIES OLD AND VERY UGLY
3959-706-0001 THE WIDOW LED A SECLUDED LIFE WITH HER TWO UNMARRIED NIECES WHO WERE ALSO ELDERLY WOMEN SHE HAD NO NEED TO LET HER LODGE BUT EVERY ONE KNEW THAT SHE HAD TAKEN IN GRUSHENKA AS A LODGER FOUR YEARS BEFORE SOLELY TO PLEASE HER KINSMAN THE MERCHANT SAMSONOV
3959-706-0002 IT WAS SAID THAT THE JEALOUS OLD MAN'S OBJECT IN PLACING HIS FAVORITE WITH THE WIDOW MOROZOV WAS THAT THE OLD WOMAN SHOULD KEEP A SHARP EYE ON HER NEW LODGER'S CONDUCT BUT THIS SHARP EYE SOON PROVED TO BE UNNECESSARY
3959-706-0003 AND IN THE END THE WIDOW MOROZOV SELDOM MET GRUSHENKA AND DID NOT WORRY HER BY LOOKING AFTER HER IN ANY WAY
3959-706-0004 IT IS TRUE THAT FOUR YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE THE OLD MAN HAD BROUGHT THE SLIM DELICATE SHY TIMID DREAMY AND SAD GIRL OF EIGHTEEN FROM THE CHIEF TOWN OF THE PROVINCE AND MUCH HAD HAPPENED SINCE THEN
3959-706-0005 LITTLE WAS KNOWN OF THE GIRL'S HISTORY IN THE TOWN AND THAT LITTLE WAS VAGUE NOTHING MORE HAD BEEN LEARNT DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS EVEN AFTER MANY PERSONS HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN INTO WHOM AGRAFENA ALEXANDROVNA HAD MEANWHILE DEVELOPED
3959-706-0006 THERE WERE RUMORS THAT SHE HAD BEEN AT SEVENTEEN BETRAYED BY SOME ONE SOME SORT OF OFFICER AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS ABANDONED BY HIM
3959-706-0007 IT WAS SAID HOWEVER THAT THOUGH GRUSHENKA HAD BEEN RAISED FROM DESTITUTION BY THE OLD MAN SAMSONOV SHE CAME OF A RESPECTABLE FAMILY BELONGING TO THE CLERICAL CLASS THAT SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A DEACON OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT
3959-706-0008 AND NOW AFTER FOUR YEARS THE SENSITIVE INJURED AND PATHETIC LITTLE ORPHAN HAD BECOME A PLUMP ROSY BEAUTY OF THE RUSSIAN TYPE A WOMAN OF BOLD AND DETERMINED CHARACTER PROUD AND INSOLENT
3959-706-0009 SHE HAD A GOOD HEAD FOR BUSINESS WAS ACQUISITIVE SAVING AND CAREFUL AND BY FAIR MEANS OR FOUL HAD SUCCEEDED IT WAS SAID IN AMASSING A LITTLE FORTUNE THERE WAS ONLY ONE POINT ON WHICH ALL WERE AGREED
3959-706-0010 GRUSHENKA WAS NOT EASILY TO BE APPROACHED AND EXCEPT HER AGED PROTECTOR THERE HAD NOT BEEN ONE MAN WHO COULD BOAST OF HER FAVORS DURING THOSE FOUR YEARS IT WAS A POSITIVE FACT FOR THERE HAD BEEN A GOOD MANY ESPECIALLY DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS
3959-706-0011 WHO HAD ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN THOSE FAVORS BUT ALL THEIR EFFORTS HAD BEEN IN VAIN AND SOME OF THESE SUITORS HAD BEEN FORCED TO BEAT AN UNDIGNIFIED AND EVEN COMIC RETREAT
3959-706-0012 IT WAS KNOWN TOO THAT THE YOUNG PERSON HAD ESPECIALLY OF LATE BEEN GIVEN TO WHAT IS CALLED SPECULATION
3959-706-0013 AND AFTERWARDS HAD MADE OUT OF THEM TEN TIMES THEIR VALUE THE OLD WIDOWER SAMSONOV A MAN OF LARGE FORTUNE WAS STINGY AND MERCILESS HE TYRANNIZED OVER HIS GROWN UP SONS BUT FOR THE LAST YEAR DURING WHICH HE HAD BEEN ILL
3959-706-0014 AND LOST THE USE OF HIS SWOLLEN LEGS HE HAD FALLEN GREATLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIS PROTEGEE WHOM HE HAD AT FIRST KEPT STRICTLY AND IN HUMBLE SURROUNDINGS ON LENTEN FARE AS THE WITS SAID AT THE TIME
3959-706-0015 BUT GRUSHENKA HAD SUCCEEDED IN EMANCIPATING HERSELF WHILE SHE ESTABLISHED IN HIM A BOUNDLESS BELIEF IN HER FIDELITY THE OLD MAN NOW LONG SINCE DEAD HAD HAD A LARGE BUSINESS IN HIS DAY AND WAS ALSO A NOTEWORTHY CHARACTER MISERLY AND HARD AS FLINT
3959-706-0016 THOUGH GRUSHENKA'S HOLD UPON HIM WAS SO STRONG THAT HE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT HER IT HAD BEEN SO ESPECIALLY FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HE DID NOT SETTLE ANY CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE ON HER AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MOVED TO DO SO IF SHE HAD THREATENED TO LEAVE HIM BUT HE HAD PRESENTED HER WITH A SMALL SUM
3959-706-0017 YOU ARE A WENCH WITH BRAINS HE SAID TO HER WHEN HE GAVE HER EIGHT THOUSAND ROUBLES AND YOU MUST LOOK AFTER YOURSELF BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT EXCEPT YOUR YEARLY ALLOWANCE AS BEFORE YOU'LL GET NOTHING MORE FROM ME TO THE DAY OF MY DEATH
3959-706-0018 AND I'LL LEAVE YOU NOTHING IN MY WILL EITHER AND HE KEPT HIS WORD HE DIED AND LEFT EVERYTHING TO HIS SONS WHOM WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN HE HAD TREATED ALL HIS LIFE AS SERVANTS GRUSHENKA WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN HIS WILL
3959-706-0019 ENDED TO HIS OWN SURPRISE BY FALLING MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER OLD SAMSONOV GRAVELY ILL AS HE WAS WAS IMMENSELY AMUSED IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE ACQUAINTANCE GRUSHENKA WAS ABSOLUTELY AND SPONTANEOUSLY OPEN WITH THE OLD MAN
3959-706-0020 OF LATE WHEN DMITRI TOO HAD COME ON THE SCENE WITH HIS LOVE THE OLD MAN LEFT OFF LAUGHING ON THE CONTRARY HE ONCE GAVE GRUSHENKA A STERN AND EARNEST PIECE OF ADVICE IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO FATHER OR SON
3959-706-0021 YOU'D BETTER CHOOSE THE OLD MAN IF ONLY YOU MAKE SURE THE OLD SCOUNDREL WILL MARRY YOU AND SETTLE SOME FORTUNE ON YOU BEFOREHAND
3959-706-0022 THESE WERE THE VERY WORDS OF THE OLD PROFLIGATE WHO FELT ALREADY THAT HIS DEATH WAS NOT FAR OFF AND WHO ACTUALLY DIED FIVE MONTHS LATER I WILL NOTE TOO IN PASSING
3959-706-0023 THAT ALTHOUGH MANY IN OUR TOWN KNEW OF THE GROTESQUE AND MONSTROUS RIVALRY OF THE KARAMAZOVS FATHER AND SON THE OBJECT OF WHICH WAS GRUSHENKA SCARCELY ANY ONE UNDERSTOOD WHAT REALLY UNDERLAY HER ATTITUDE TO BOTH OF THEM EVEN GRUSHENKA'S TWO SERVANTS
3959-706-0024 WHO CAME FROM GRUSHENKA'S OLD HOME AND HER GRANDDAUGHTER A SMART YOUNG GIRL OF TWENTY WHO PERFORMED THE DUTIES OF A MAID GRUSHENKA LIVED VERY ECONOMICALLY AND HER SURROUNDINGS WERE ANYTHING BUT LUXURIOUS
3959-706-0025 GRUSHENKA WAS LYING DOWN IN HER DRAWING ROOM ON THE BIG HARD CLUMSY SOFA WITH A MAHOGANY BACK THE SOFA WAS COVERED WITH SHABBY AND RAGGED LEATHER UNDER HER HEAD SHE HAD TWO WHITE DOWN PILLOWS TAKEN FROM HER BED
3959-706-0026 FROM THE HALL THEY COULD HEAR GRUSHENKA LEAP UP FROM THE SOFA AND CRY OUT IN A FRIGHTENED VOICE WHO'S THERE BUT THE MAID MET THE VISITORS AND AT ONCE CALLED BACK TO HER MISTRESS IT'S NOT HE IT'S NOTHING ONLY OTHER VISITORS WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER
3959-706-0027 MUTTERED RAKITIN LEADING ALYOSHA INTO THE DRAWING ROOM GRUSHENKA WAS STANDING BY THE SOFA AS THOUGH STILL ALARMED A THICK COIL OF HER DARK BROWN HAIR ESCAPED FROM ITS LACE COVERING AND FELL ON HER RIGHT SHOULDER

3959-706-0051 THE GREAT GRIEF IN HIS HEART SWALLOWED UP EVERY SENSATION THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AROUSED
3959-706-0052 IF ONLY HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT CLEARLY AT THAT MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT HE HAD NOW THE STRONGEST ARMOR TO PROTECT HIM FROM EVERY LUST AND TEMPTATION YET IN SPITE OF THE VAGUE IRRESPONSIVENESS OF HIS SPIRITUAL CONDITION AND THE SORROW THAT OVERWHELMED HIM
3959-706-0053 HE COULD NOT HELP WONDERING AT A NEW AND STRANGE SENSATION IN HIS HEART THIS WOMAN THIS DREADFUL WOMAN HAD NO TERROR FOR HIM NOW NONE OF THAT TERROR THAT HAD STIRRED IN HIS SOUL AT ANY PASSING THOUGHT OF WOMAN ON THE CONTRARY
