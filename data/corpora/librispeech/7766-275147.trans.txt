7766-275147-0000 MISS WESTERFIELD SHE LOCKED THE DOOR OF HER BEDCHAMBER AND THREW OFF HER WALKING DRESS LIGHT AS IT WAS SHE FELT AS IF IT WOULD STIFLE HER EVEN THE RIBBON ROUND HER NECK WAS MORE THAN SHE COULD ENDURE AND BREATHE FREELY
7766-275147-0001 HER OVERBURDENED HEART FOUND NO RELIEF IN TEARS
7766-275147-0002 ONE OF THE WINDOWS WAS OPEN ALREADY SHE THREW UP THE OTHER TO GET MORE AIR IN THE COOLER ATMOSPHERE HER MEMORY RECOVERED ITSELF SHE RECOLLECTED THE NEWSPAPER THAT HERBERT HAD TAKEN FROM HER INSTANTLY SHE RANG FOR THE MAID
7766-275147-0003 FOR HAVING BEEN TOO READY TO FORGIVE THE WRETCH WHO HAD TAKEN HER HUSBAND FROM HER
7766-275147-0004 OH GOD HOW CAN I GIVE THAT WOMAN BACK THE HAPPINESS OF WHICH I HAVE ROBBED HER THE COMPOSING INFLUENCE OF PRAYER ON A TROUBLED MIND WAS SOMETHING THAT SHE HAD HEARD OF IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHE EXPERIENCED NOW
7766-275147-0005 AN OVERPOWERING IMPATIENCE TO MAKE THE SPEEDIEST AND COMPLETEST ATONEMENT POSSESSED HER MUST SHE WAIT TILL HERBERT LINLEY NO LONGER CONCEALED THAT HE WAS WEARY OF HER AND CAST HER OFF NO
7766-275147-0006 IT SHOULD BE HER OWN ACT THAT PARTED THEM AND THAT DID IT AT ONCE SHE THREW OPEN THE DOOR AND HURRIED HALF WAY DOWN THE STAIRS BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED THE ONE TERRIBLE OBSTACLE IN HER WAY THE DIVORCE SLOWLY AND SADLY SHE SUBMITTED AND WENT BACK TO HER ROOM
7766-275147-0007 THERE WAS NO DISGUISING IT THE TWO WHO HAD ONCE BEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE WERE PARTED IRREVOCABLY BY THE WIFE'S OWN ACT LET HIM REPENT EVER SO SINCERELY LET HIM BE EVER SO READY TO RETURN
7766-275147-0008 WOULD THE WOMAN WHOSE FAITH HERBERT LINLEY HAD BETRAYED TAKE HIM BACK THE DIVORCE THE MERCILESS DIVORCE ANSWERED NO SHE PAUSED THINKING OF THE MARRIAGE THAT WAS NOW A MARRIAGE NO MORE
7766-275147-0009 THE TOILET TABLE WAS CLOSE TO HER SHE LOOKED ABSENTLY AT HER HAGGARD FACE IN THE GLASS WHAT A LOST WRETCH SHE SAW THE GENEROUS IMPULSES WHICH OTHER WOMEN WERE FREE TO FEEL WERE FORBIDDEN LUXURIES TO HER
7766-275147-0010 SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HER WICKEDNESS SHE WAS EAGER TO SACRIFICE HERSELF FOR THE GOOD OF THE ONCE DEAR FRIEND WHOM SHE HAD WRONGED USELESS LONGINGS TOO LATE TOO LATE SHE REGRETTED IT BITTERLY
7766-275147-0011 WHY COMPARING MISSUS LINLEY'S PROSPECTS WITH HERS WAS THERE ANYTHING TO JUSTIFY REGRET FOR THE DIVORCED WIFE SHE HAD HER SWEET LITTLE CHILD TO MAKE HER HAPPY SHE HAD A FORTUNE OF HER OWN TO LIFT HER ABOVE SORDID CARES
7766-275147-0012 SHE WAS STILL HANDSOME STILL A WOMAN TO BE ADMIRED WHILE SHE HELD HER PLACE IN THE WORLD AS HIGH AS EVER WHAT WAS THE PROSPECT BEFORE SYDNEY WESTERFIELD
7766-275147-0013 ABSOLUTELY DEPENDENT ON A MAN WHO WAS AT THAT MOMENT PERHAPS LAMENTING THE WIFE WHOM HE HAD DESERTED AND LOST HOW LONG WOULD IT BE BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELF AN OUTCAST WITHOUT A FRIEND TO HELP HER
7766-275147-0014 WITH A REPUTATION HOPELESSLY LOST FACE TO FACE WITH THE TEMPTATION TO DROWN HERSELF OR POISON HERSELF AS OTHER WOMEN HAD DROWNED THEMSELVES OR POISONED THEMSELVES WHEN THE BRIGHTEST FUTURE BEFORE THEM WAS REST IN DEATH
7766-275147-0015 IF SHE HAD BEEN A FEW YEARS OLDER HERBERT LINLEY MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE SEEN HER A LIVING CREATURE BUT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO FOLLOW ANY TRAIN OF REPELLENT THOUGHT PERSISTENTLY TO ITS END
7766-275147-0016 THE MAN SHE HAD GUILTILY AND YET HOW NATURALLY LOVED WAS LORD AND MASTER IN HER HEART DOUBT HIM AS SHE MIGHT EVEN IN HIS ABSENCE HE PLEADED WITH HER TO HAVE SOME FAITH IN HIM STILL SHE REVIEWED HIS LANGUAGE AND HIS CONDUCT TOWARD HER
7766-275147-0017 WHEN SHE HAD RETURNED THAT MORNING FROM HER WALK HE HAD BEEN KIND AND CONSIDERATE HE HAD LISTENED TO HER LITTLE STORY OF THE RELICS OF HER FATHER FOUND IN THE GARRET AS IF HER INTERESTS WERE HIS INTERESTS THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING TO DISAPPOINT HER NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
7766-275147-0018 AS IF HE HAD FORGOTTEN HER IN THE INTEREST OF WATCHING THE STRANGERS PASSING BY PERHAPS HE WAS NOT THINKING OF THE STRANGERS PERHAPS HIS MIND WAS DWELLING FONDLY AND REGRETFULLY ON HIS WIFE
7766-275147-0019 THAN HERSELF AND HER FUTURE LOOKING ABSENTLY ROUND THE ROOM SHE NOTICED THE PACKET OF HER FATHER'S LETTERS PLACED ON THE TABLE BY HER BEDSIDE THE FIRST THREE LETTERS THAT SHE EXAMINED
7766-275147-0020 WHO WERE NOT IN THE SECRET WAS THE ONE FEELING IN COMMON WHICH HER FATHER'S CORRESPONDENTS PRESENTED IN MERCY TO HIS MEMORY SHE THREW THE LETTERS INTO THE EMPTY FIREPLACE AND DESTROYED THEM BY BURNING
7766-275147-0021 WHEN I TELL YOU THAT SANDYSEAL PLACE HAS BECOME A PRIORY OF ENGLISH NUNS OF THE ORDER OF SAINT BENEDICT I THINK I SEE YOU LOOK UP FROM MY LETTER WITH YOUR BIG BLACK EYES STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE YOU
7766-275147-0022 AND SAY AND SWEAR THAT THIS MUST BE ONE OF MY MYSTIFICATIONS UNFORTUNATELY FOR I AM FOND OF THE OLD HOUSE IN WHICH I WAS BORN IT IS ONLY TOO TRUE THE INSTRUCTIONS IN MY FATHER'S WILL UNDER WHICH SANDYSEAL HAS BEEN SOLD ARE PEREMPTORY
7766-275147-0023 THEY ARE THE RESULT OF A PROMISE MADE MANY YEARS SINCE TO HIS WIFE YOU AND I WERE BOTH VERY YOUNG WHEN MY POOR MOTHER DIED BUT I THINK YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT SHE LIKE THE REST OF HER FAMILY WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC HAVING REMINDED YOU OF THIS
7766-275147-0024 I MAY NEXT TELL YOU THAT SANDYSEAL PLACE WAS MY MOTHER'S PROPERTY IT FORMED PART OF HER MARRIAGE PORTION AND IT WAS SETTLED ON MY FATHER IF SHE DIED BEFORE HIM AND IF SHE LEFT NO FEMALE CHILD TO SURVIVE HER I AM HER ONLY CHILD
7766-275147-0025 ANSWERS THIS QUESTION AND TELLS A VERY SAD STORY IN DEFERENCE TO MY MOTHER'S WISHES IT WAS KEPT STRICTLY A SECRET FROM ME WHILE MY FATHER LIVED THERE WAS A YOUNGER SISTER OF MY MOTHER'S WHO WAS THE BEAUTY OF THE FAMILY
7766-275147-0026 LOVED AND ADMIRED BY EVERYBODY WHO WAS ACQUAINTED WITH HER IT IS NEEDLESS TO MAKE THIS LONG LETTER LONGER BY DWELLING ON THE GIRL'S MISERABLE STORY YOU HAVE HEARD IT OF OTHER GIRLS OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHE LOVED AND TRUSTED SHE WAS DECEIVED AND DESERTED
7766-275147-0027 ALONE AND FRIENDLESS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY HER FAIR FAME BLEMISHED HER HOPE IN THE FUTURE UTTERLY DESTROYED SHE ATTEMPTED TO DROWN HERSELF THIS TOOK PLACE IN FRANCE THE BEST OF GOOD WOMEN A SISTER OF CHARITY HAPPENED TO BE NEAR ENOUGH TO THE RIVER TO RESCUE HER
7766-275147-0028 THE POOR DESERTED CREATURE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED SHE COULD NEVER FORGET THAT SHE HAD DISGRACED THEM THE GOOD SISTER OF CHARITY WON HER CONFIDENCE A RETREAT WHICH WOULD HIDE HER FROM THE WORLD AND DEVOTE HER TO RELIGION FOR THE REST OF HER DAYS
7766-275147-0029 HE AT ONCE PROPOSED TO BEQUEATH THE HOUSE AS A FREE GIFT TO THE BENEDICTINES MY MOTHER THANKED HIM AND REFUSED SHE WAS THINKING OF ME IF OUR SON FAILS TO INHERIT THE HOUSE FROM HIS FATHER SHE SAID IT IS ONLY RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE IN MONEY
7766-275147-0030 LET IT BE SOLD SO HERE I AM
7766-275147-0031 MY IDEA IS TO INVEST IT IN THE FUNDS AND TO LET IT THRIVE AT INTEREST UNTIL I GROW OLDER AND RETIRE PERHAPS FROM SERVICE IN THE NAVY
7766-275147-0032 WHICH I MYSELF CAN ESTABLISH AND DIRECT IF I DIE FIRST OH THERE IS A CHANCE OF IT WE MAY HAVE A NAVAL WAR PERHAPS OR I MAY TURN OUT ONE OF THOSE INCORRIGIBLE MADMEN WHO RISK THEIR LIVES IN ARCTIC EXPLORATION IN CASE OF THE WORST THEREFORE
7766-275147-0033 I SHALL LEAVE THE INTERESTS OF MY CONTEMPLATED HOME IN YOUR HONEST AND CAPABLE HANDS FOR THE PRESENT GOOD BY AND A PROSPEROUS VOYAGE OUTWARD BOUND SO THE LETTER ENDED
7766-275147-0034 SYDNEY DWELT WITH RELUCTANT ATTENTION ON THE LATTER HALF OF IT THE STORY OF THE UNHAPPY FAVORITE OF THE FAMILY HAD ITS OWN MELANCHOLY AND SINISTER INTEREST FOR HER
7766-275147-0035 WHAT RELIGIOUS CONSOLATIONS WOULD ENCOURAGE HER PENITENCE WHAT PRAYERS WHAT HOPES WOULD RECONCILE HER ON HER DEATH BED TO THE COMMON DOOM SHE SIGHED AS SHE FOLDED UP CAPTAIN BENNYDECK'S LETTER AND PUT IT IN HER BOSOM TO BE READ AGAIN
7766-275147-0036 IF MY LOT HAD FALLEN AMONG GOOD PEOPLE SHE THOUGHT PERHAPS I MIGHT HAVE BELONGED TO THE CHURCH WHICH TOOK CARE OF THAT POOR GIRL HER MIND WAS STILL PURSUING ITS OWN SAD COURSE OF INQUIRY SHE WAS WONDERING IN WHAT PART OF ENGLAND SANDYSEAL MIGHT BE
7766-275147-0037 SHE WAS ASKING HERSELF IF THE NUNS AT THE OLD MOATED HOUSE EVER OPENED THEIR DOORS TO WOMEN WHOSE ONE CLAIM ON THEIR COMMON CHRISTIANITY WAS THE CLAIM TO BE PITIED WHEN SHE HEARD LINLEY'S FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING THE DOOR
