5093-29101-0000 CONDESCENDS TO MINGLE AMONG THE PEOPLE AND ACCEPT THE HOSPITALITIES OF SUCH A PLACE AS HAWKEYE THE HONOR IS NOT CONSIDERED A LIGHT ONE
5093-29101-0001 ALL PARTIES ARE FLATTERED BY IT AND POLITICS ARE FORGOTTEN IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE SO DISTINGUISHED AMONG HIS FELLOWS SENATOR DILWORTHY WHO WAS FROM A NEIGHBORING STATE HAD BEEN A UNIONIST IN THE DARKEST DAYS OF HIS COUNTRY
5093-29101-0002 AND HAD THRIVEN BY IT BUT WAS THAT ANY REASON WHY COLONEL SELLERS WHO HAD BEEN A CONFEDERATE AND HAD NOT THRIVEN BY IT SHOULD GIVE HIM THE COLD SHOULDER
5093-29101-0003 BUT YOU WILL MINGLE WITH OUR PEOPLE AND YOU WILL SEE HERE DEVELOPMENTS THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU THE COLONEL WAS SO PROFUSE IN HIS HOSPITALITY THAT HE MUST HAVE MADE THE IMPRESSION UPON HIMSELF THAT HE HAD ENTERTAINED THE SENATOR AT HIS OWN MANSION DURING HIS STAY
5093-29101-0004 AT ANY RATE HE AFTERWARDS ALWAYS SPOKE OF HIM AS HIS GUEST AND NOT SELDOM REFERRED TO THE SENATOR'S RELISH OF CERTAIN VIANDS ON HIS TABLE HE DID IN FACT PRESS HIM TO DINE UPON THE MORNING OF THE DAY THE SENATOR WAS GOING AWAY
5093-29101-0005 AND MADE MANY INQUIRIES AS TO THE PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURE OF EDUCATION AND OF RELIGION AND ESPECIALLY AS TO THE CONDITION OF THE EMANCIPATED RACE PROVIDENCE HE SAID
5093-29101-0006 HAS PLACED THEM IN OUR HANDS AND ALTHOUGH YOU AND I GENERAL MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN A DIFFERENT DESTINY FOR THEM UNDER THE CONSTITUTION
5093-29101-0007 DISINCLINED TO WORK FOR WHITE FOLKS WITHOUT SECURITY PLANNING HOW TO LIVE BY ONLY WORKING FOR THEMSELVES IDLE SIR THERE'S MY GARDEN JUST A RUIN OF WEEDS NOTHING PRACTICAL IN EM
5093-29101-0008 NOW A WHITE MAN CAN CONCEIVE GREAT OPERATIONS AND CARRY THEM OUT A NIGGRO CAN'T STILL REPLIED THE SENATOR GRANTING THAT HE MIGHT INJURE HIMSELF IN A WORLDLY POINT OF VIEW HIS ELEVATION THROUGH EDUCATION
5093-29101-0009 OF COURSE ONE OF THE ENTERTAINMENTS OFFERED THE SENATOR WAS A PUBLIC RECEPTION HELD IN THE COURT HOUSE AT WHICH HE MADE A SPEECH TO HIS FELLOW CITIZENS
5093-29101-0010 HE MARSHALLED THE PROCESSION OF MASONS OF ODD FELLOWS AND OF FIREMEN THE GOOD TEMPLARS THE SONS OF TEMPERANCE THE CADETS OF TEMPERANCE THE DAUGHTERS OF REBECCA THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN AND CITIZENS GENERALLY WHICH FOLLOWED THE SENATOR TO THE COURT HOUSE
5093-29101-0011 THE OCCASION WAS ONE TO CALL OUT HIS FINEST POWERS OF PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND ONE HE LONG DWELT ON WITH PLEASURE THIS NOT BEING AN EDITION OF THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE SENATOR DILWORTHY'S SPEECH IN FULL
5093-29101-0012 AND CONFER IN FAMILIAR CONVERSE WITH MY FRIENDS IN YOUR GREAT STATE THE GOOD OPINION OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS OF ALL SECTIONS IS THE SWEETEST SOLACE IN ALL MY ANXIETIES
5093-29101-0013 AS I WAS SAYING WHEN I CAN LAY DOWN THE CARES OF OFFICE AND RETIRE TO THE SWEETS OF PRIVATE LIFE IN SOME SUCH SWEET PEACEFUL INTELLIGENT WIDE AWAKE AND PATRIOTIC PLACE AS HAWKEYE APPLAUSE
5093-29101-0014 I HAVE TRAVELED MUCH I HAVE SEEN ALL PARTS OF OUR GLORIOUS UNION BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A LOVELIER VILLAGE THAN YOURS OR ONE THAT HAS MORE SIGNS OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL AND RELIGIOUS PROSPERITY
5093-29101-0015 MORE APPLAUSE THE SENATOR THEN LAUNCHED INTO A SKETCH OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY AND DWELT FOR AN HOUR OR MORE UPON ITS PROSPERITY AND THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED IT
5093-29101-0016 HE THEN TOUCHED REVERENTLY UPON THE INSTITUTIONS OF RELIGION AND UPON THE NECESSITY OF PRIVATE PURITY IF WE WERE TO HAVE ANY PUBLIC MORALITY I TRUST HE SAID THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN WITHIN THE SOUND OF MY VOICE
5093-29101-0017 AND AFTER SOME REMARKS TO THEM THE SENATOR CLOSED WITH AN APOSTROPHE TO THE GENIUS OF AMERICAN LIBERTY WALKING WITH THE SUNDAY SCHOOL IN ONE HAND AND TEMPERANCE IN THE OTHER UP THE GLORIFIED STEPS OF THE NATIONAL CAPITOL
5093-29101-0018 COLONEL SELLERS DID NOT OF COURSE LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS UPON SO INFLUENTIAL A PERSON AS THE SENATOR THE DESIRABILITY OF IMPROVING THE NAVIGATION OF COLUMBUS RIVER
5093-29101-0019 WHEN HOWEVER THEY REACHED STONE'S LANDING THE SENATOR LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND INQUIRED IS THIS NAPOLEON THIS IS THE NUCLEUS THE NUCLEUS SAID THE COLONEL UNROLLING HIS MAP HERE IS THE DEEPO THE CHURCH THE CITY HALL AND SO ON
5093-29101-0020 AH I SEE HOW FAR FROM HERE IS COLUMBUS RIVER DOES THAT STREAM EMPTY THAT WHY THAT'S GOOSE RUN THAR AIN'T NO COLUMBUS THOUT'N IT'S OVER TO HAWKEYE INTERRUPTED ONE OF THE CITIZENS WHO HAD COME OUT TO STARE AT THE STRANGERS
5093-29101-0021 A RAILROAD COME HERE LAST SUMMER BUT IT HAINT BEEN HERE NO MO YES SIR THE COLONEL HASTENED TO EXPLAIN IN THE OLD RECORDS COLUMBUS RIVER IS CALLED GOOSE RUN YOU SEE HOW IT SWEEPS ROUND THE TOWN FORTY NINE MILES TO THE MISSOURI
5093-29101-0022 SLOOP NAVIGATION ALL THE WAY PRETTY MUCH DRAINS THIS WHOLE COUNTRY WHEN IT'S IMPROVED STEAMBOATS WILL RUN RIGHT UP HERE IT'S GOT TO BE ENLARGED DEEPENED YOU SEE BY THE MAP COLUMBUS RIVER THIS COUNTRY MUST HAVE WATER COMMUNICATION
5093-29101-0023 I SHOULD SAY A MILLION IS THAT YOUR FIGURE MISTER BRIERLY ACCORDING TO OUR SURVEYS SAID HARRY A MILLION WOULD DO IT A MILLION SPENT ON THE RIVER WOULD MAKE NAPOLEON WORTH TWO MILLIONS AT LEAST
5093-29101-0024 I SEE NODDED THE SENATOR BUT YOU'D BETTER BEGIN BY ASKING ONLY FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE USUAL WAY YOU CAN BEGIN TO SELL TOWN LOTS ON THAT APPROPRIATION YOU KNOW
5093-29101-0025 THE SENATOR HIMSELF TO DO HIM JUSTICE WAS NOT VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE COUNTRY OR THE STREAM BUT HE FAVORED THE APPROPRIATION AND HE GAVE THE COLONEL AND MISTER BRIERLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULD ENDEAVOR TO GET IT THROUGH
5093-29101-0026 WHATEVER I DO WILL BE FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST IT WILL REQUIRE A PORTION OF THE APPROPRIATION FOR NECESSARY EXPENSES AND I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS WHO WILL HAVE TO BE SEEN BUT YOU CAN RECKON UPON MY HUMBLE SERVICES
5093-29101-0027 AND LAID THE APPROPRIATION SCHEME AWAY AMONG HIS OTHER PLANS FOR BENEFITING THE PUBLIC IT WAS ON THIS VISIT ALSO THAT THE SENATOR MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MISTER WASHINGTON HAWKINS AND WAS GREATLY TAKEN WITH HIS INNOCENCE
5093-29101-0028 BE MADE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENERAL GOOD AND HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY OF THAT KIND THE RESULT OF SEVERAL CONFERENCES WITH WASHINGTON WAS THAT THE SENATOR PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD GO TO WASHINGTON WITH HIM
5093-29101-0029 AND BECOME HIS PRIVATE SECRETARY AND THE SECRETARY OF HIS COMMITTEE A PROPOSAL WHICH WAS EAGERLY ACCEPTED THE SENATOR SPENT SUNDAY IN HAWKEYE AND ATTENDED CHURCH
5093-29101-0030 HE CHEERED THE HEART OF THE WORTHY AND ZEALOUS MINISTER BY AN EXPRESSION OF HIS SYMPATHY IN HIS LABORS AND BY MANY INQUIRIES IN REGARD TO THE RELIGIOUS STATE OF THE REGION IT WAS NOT A VERY PROMISING STATE AND THE GOOD MAN FELT HOW MUCH LIGHTER HIS TASK WOULD BE
5093-29101-0031 IF HE HAD THE AID OF SUCH A MAN AS SENATOR DILWORTHY I AM GLAD TO SEE MY DEAR SIR SAID THE SENATOR THAT YOU GIVE THEM THE DOCTRINES IT IS OWING TO A NEGLECT OF THE DOCTRINES THAT THERE IS SUCH A FEARFUL FALLING AWAY IN THE COUNTRY
5093-29101-0032 I WISH THAT WE MIGHT HAVE YOU IN WASHINGTON AS CHAPLAIN NOW IN THE SENATE THE GOOD MAN COULD NOT BUT BE A LITTLE FLATTERED AND IF SOMETIMES THEREAFTER IN HIS DISCOURAGING WORK HE ALLOWED THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS BE CALLED TO WASHINGTON
5093-29101-0033 AS CHAPLAIN OF THE SENATE TO CHEER HIM WHO CAN WONDER THE SENATOR'S COMMENDATION AT LEAST DID ONE SERVICE FOR HIM IT ELEVATED HIM IN THE OPINION OF HAWKEYE
5093-29101-0034 THAT HE ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTIONS OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO HER THE NEXT DAY AN INTENTION WHICH HARRY RECEIVED GLUMLY AND WHEN THE SENATOR WAS OUT OF HEARING HE CALLED HIM AN OLD FOOL FIE SAID LAURA I DO BELIEVE YOU ARE JEALOUS HARRY
5093-29101-0035 HE IS A VERY PLEASANT MAN HE SAID YOU WERE A YOUNG MAN OF GREAT PROMISE THE SENATOR DID CALL NEXT DAY AND THE RESULT OF HIS VISIT WAS THAT HE WAS CONFIRMED IN HIS IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM VERY ATTRACTIVE TO LADIES
5093-29101-0036 HE SAW LAURA AGAIN AND AGAIN DURING HIS STAY AND FELT MORE AND MORE THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE OF HER FEMININE BEAUTY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT WHO CAME NEAR HER HARRY WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH RAGE WHILE THE SENATOR REMAINED IN TOWN
5093-29101-0037 HE DECLARED THAT WOMEN WERE ALWAYS READY TO DROP ANY MAN FOR HIGHER GAME AND HE ATTRIBUTED HIS OWN ILL LUCK TO THE SENATOR'S APPEARANCE THE FELLOW WAS IN FACT CRAZY ABOUT HER BEAUTY AND READY TO BEAT HIS BRAINS OUT IN CHAGRIN
