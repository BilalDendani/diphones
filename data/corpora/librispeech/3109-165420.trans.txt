3109-165420-0003 GIVING HIM A SEALED PAPER WHICH HE WAS NOT TO OPEN UNTIL HE WAS IN A CERTAIN LATITUDE AND THEN EXPRESSLY TO FOLLOW THE GIVEN DIRECTIONS WHEN HE ARRIVED IN THE APPOINTED PLACE HE COLLECTED THE WHOLE CREW
3109-165420-0004 AND HIS CREW REQUESTING THEM TO GO TO BRAZIL AND DISPOSE OF THE CARGO TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE AND MAKE AN EQUAL DIVISION OF THE MONEY DAVIS THEN COMMANDED THE CREW TO SIGNIFY WHETHER THEY WERE INCLINED TO FOLLOW THAT MODE OF LIFE WHEN

3109-165420-0013 AFTER DAVIS HAD PILLAGED HER OF WHAT THINGS HE PLEASED IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE VESSEL AND STORES AND GOODS A LARGE BOWL OF PUNCH WAS MADE UNDER ITS EXHILARATING INFLUENCE IT WAS PROPOSED TO CHOOSE A COMMANDER AND TO FORM THEIR FUTURE MODE OF POLICY

3109-165420-0019 DAVIS PROPOSED TO HIS CREW TO ATTACK HER ASSURING THEM THAT SHE WOULD PROVE A RICH PRIZE THIS APPEARED TO THE CREW SUCH A HAZARDOUS ENTERPRISE THAT THEY WERE RATHER ADVERSE TO THE MEASURE
3109-165420-0020 BUT HE ACQUAINTED THEM THAT HE HAD CONCEIVED A STRATAGEM THAT HE WAS CONFIDENT WOULD SUCCEED THEY MIGHT THEREFORE SAFELY LEAVE THE MATTER TO HIS MANAGEMENT HE THEN COMMENCED CHASE AND ORDERED HIS PRIZE TO DO THE SAME BEING A BETTER SAILER
3109-165420-0021 HE SOON CAME UP WITH THE ENEMY AND SHOWED HIS BLACK COLORS WITH NO SMALL SURPRISE AT HIS INSOLENCE IN COMING SO NEAR THEM THEY COMMANDED HIM TO STRIKE HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS DISPOSED TO GIVE THEM EMPLOYMENT UNTIL HIS COMPANION CAME UP WHO WAS ABLE TO CONTEND WITH THEM
3109-165420-0022 MEANWHILE ASSURING THEM THAT IF THEY DID NOT STRIKE TO HIM IT WOULD MOST CERTAINLY FARE THE WORSE FOR THEM THEN GIVING THEM A BROADSIDE HE RECEIVED THE SAME IN RETURN WHEN THE OTHER PIRATE SHIP DREW NEAR THEY
