8887-281471-0000 JEALOUSY AT THE CLOSE OF THE GAME THERE WAS ANOTHER BOY ON THE FIELD WHO WAS QUITE AS GLUM AND DOWNCAST AS HOOKER HIMSELF THIS WAS PHIL SPRINGER
8887-281471-0001 WHO REMAINED SEATED ON THE BENCH WHILE HIS TEAM MATES AND A PORTION OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC CROWD SWARMED CHEERING AROUND GRANT AND LIFTED HIM TO THEIR SHOULDERS
8887-281471-0002 PRESENTLY HE REALIZED THAT THIS BEHAVIOR ON HIS PART MUST ATTRACT ATTENTION THE MOMENT THE EXCITEMENT RELAXED AND HE GOT UP WITH THE INTENTION OF HURRYING AT ONCE TO THE GYMNASIUM
8887-281471-0003 BARELY HAD HE STARTED HOWEVER WHEN SOMETHING BROUGHT HIM TO A HALT AND BENEATH HIS BREATH HE MUTTERED THAT WON'T DO THEY'D NOTICE THAT TOO AND SUS SAY I WAS JEALOUS
8887-281471-0004 HE WAS JEALOUS BITTERLY SO BUT HE FORCED HIMSELF TO JOIN THE CHEERING CROWD AND TO MAKE A HALF HEARTED PRETENSE OF REJOICING ALL THE WHILE HE WAS THINKING THAT GRANT OWED EVERYTHING TO HIM
8887-281471-0005 AND THAT PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN FOOLISH IN TRAINING A FELLOW TO FILL HIS SHOES IN SUCH AN EMERGENCY FOR PHIL HAD LONG ENTERTAINED THE AMBITION OF BECOMING THE FIRST PITCHER ON THE ACADEMY NINE AND THIS YEAR HE HAD BEEN FULLY CONFIDENT UNTIL THE PRESENT HOUR
8887-281471-0006 THAT THE GOAL HE SOUGHT WAS HIS BEYOND DISPUTE THE VICTORS DID NOT FORGET TO CHEER COURTEOUSLY FOR THE VANQUISHED AND BARVILLE RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT WITH A CHEER FOR OAKDALE SO MANY PERSONS WISHED TO SHAKE HANDS WITH RODNEY GRANT
8887-281471-0007 THAT HE LAUGHINGLY PROTESTED SAYING THEY WOULD PUT HIS WING OUT OF COMMISSION SUDDENLY PERCEIVING PHIL THE TEXAN PUSHED ASIDE THOSE BETWEEN THEM SPRANG FORWARD AND PLACED A HAND ON SPRINGER'S SHOULDER CRYING HERE'S MY MENTOR
8887-281471-0008 ONLY FOR HIM I'D NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO IT I OWE WHAT LITTLE I KNOW ABOUT PITCHING TO SPRINGER LET'S GIVE HIM A CHEER FELLOWS THEY DID SO BUT THAT CHEER LACKED THE SPONTANEOUS ENTHUSIASM AND GENUINE ADMIRATION WHICH HAD BEEN THROWN INTO THE CHEERING FOR GRANT
8887-281471-0009 SOMETHING WHICH SPRINGER DID NOT FAIL TO NOTE OH THANKS SAID PHIL WEAKLY RETURNING THE WARM GRASP OF ROD'S STRONG HAND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT BLOW UP
8887-281471-0010 UNDER COVER OF THE CHATTER JOKING AND LAUGHTER WHILE THEY WERE CHANGING THEIR CLOTHES IN THE DRESSING ROOM OF THE GYMNASIUM GRANT OBSERVING THE DEJECTION SPRINGER COULD NOT HIDE TO SAVE HIMSELF AGAIN UTTERED SOME FRIENDLY WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT
8887-281471-0011 DON'T YOU FEEL SO BAD ABOUT IT OLD PARTNER HE SAID THE BEST PROFESSIONAL PITCHERS IN THE BUSINESS GET THEIR BUMPS SOMETIMES AND I MIGHT HAVE GOT MINE ALL RIGHT IF I'D STARTED THE GAME ON THE SLAB AS YOU DID YOU'LL MAKE UP FOR THAT NEXT TIME
8887-281471-0012 YOU'RE VERY KIND GRANT WAS SPRINGER'S ONLY RESPONSE PHIL GOT AWAY FROM THE OTHERS AS SOON AS HE COULD AND HURRIED HOME TO BROOD OVER IT IT HAD BEEN A HARD BLOW AND HE HAD STOOD UP POORLY BENEATH IT
8887-281471-0013 THINKING THE MATTER OVER IN SOLITUDE HE WAS FORCED INTO A REALIZATION OF THE FACT THAT HE LACKED IN A GREAT MEASURE THE CONFIDENCE AND STEADINESS CHARACTERISTIC OF RODNEY GRANT AND HE COULD NOT PUT ASIDE THE CONVICTION THAT IT WAS GRANT
8887-281471-0014 THE FELLOW HE HAD COACHED WHO WAS DESTINED TO BECOME THE STAR PITCHER OF THE NINE IN SPITE OF HIMSELF THIS THOUGHT AIDED BY OTHER UNPLEASANT CONTEMPLATIONS AWOKE IN HIS HEART A SENSATION OF ENVIOUS RESENTMENT TOWARD RODNEY
8887-281471-0015 HE WAS SORRY NOW THAT HE HAD EVER SPENT HIS TIME TEACHING THE TEXAN TO PITCH AND IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE SAME AMOUNT OF COACHING AND ENCOURAGEMENT BESTOWED UPON HOOKER WOULD NOT HAVE RESULTED IN THE TRAINING OF A MAN TO OUTDO HIM UPON THE SLAB
8887-281471-0016 AND PUSH HIM INTO THE BACKGROUND THAT EVENING HE WAS MISSING FROM THE GROUP OF BOYS WHO GATHERED IN THE VILLAGE TO TALK OVER THE GAME AND AT SCHOOL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY HE KEPT AWAY FROM GRANT AS MUCH AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DO SO
8887-281471-0017 WHEN PRACTICE TIME CAME AFTER SCHOOL WAS OVER HE PUT ON HIS SUIT AND APPEARED UPON THE FIELD BUT SOON COMPLAINED THAT HE WAS NOT FEELING WELL AND DEPARTED THE FOLLOWING MORNING SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST
8887-281471-0018 INSTANTLY SPRINGER SOUGHT HIS HAT SLIPPED HASTILY THROUGH THE HOUSE AND GOT OUT UNPERCEIVED BY THE BACK DOOR WHEN HE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL A FEW MINUTES BEFORE TIME FOR THE MORNING SESSION TO BEGIN GRANT WAS WAITING FOR HIM
8887-281471-0019 WHAT BECAME OF YOU AFTER BREAKFAST PARTNER QUESTIONED ROD I PIKED OVER TO YOUR RANCH LOOKING FOR YOU BUT YOU HAD DISAPPEARED YOUR MOTHER SAID YOU WERE AROUND A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE AND SHE THOUGHT YOU MUST BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT
8887-281471-0020 ALL THE SAME I COULDN'T FIND HIDE OR HAIR OF YOU I I TOOK A WALK FALTERED PHIL FLUSHING I'VE GOT A BUB BAD COLD IN EVIDENCE OF WHICH HE COUGHED IN A SHAMEFULLY UNNATURAL MANNER
8887-281471-0021 SAID RODNEY SYMPATHETICALLY YOU CAUGHT IT SITTING ON THE BENCH DURING THE LAST FOUR INNINGS OF THAT GAME I RECKON I REMEMBER NOW THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN PUT ON YOUR SWEATER YES I GUESS THAT'S WHEN I GOT IT AGREED PHIL
8887-281471-0022 WELL YOU'VE GOT TO SHAKE IT IN TIME FOR THE GAME WITH CLEARPORT THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL EVEN THINGS UP ALL THAT DAY SPRINGER SOUGHT TO AVOID TALKING BASEBALL WITH ANY OF THE FELLOWS
8887-281471-0023 FOR INVARIABLY THEY SPOKE OF GRANT'S SURPRISINGLY SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE AND WHEN THEY DID SO SOMETHING LIKE A SICKENING POISON SEEMED TO BUBBLE WITHIN THE JEALOUS YOUTH WHO TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NOT LONG CONTINUE TO JOIN IN THIS PRAISE
8887-281471-0024 BUT MUST SOON BETRAY HIMSELF BY BURSTING FORTH INTO A TIRADE AGAINST THE TEXAN IN A MEASURE HE DID RELIEVE HIS FEELINGS BY EXPRESSING HIS OPINION OF HERBERT RACKLIFF WHO WAS BRAZENLY SEEKING TO IGNORE THE OPEN DISDAIN OF HIS SCHOOLMATES
8887-281471-0025 HE DID NOT COME OUT FOR PRACTICE THAT NIGHT AND GRANT EXPLAINED TO THE OTHERS THAT PHIL WAS KNOCKED OUT BY A COLD WHEREUPON COOPER CHUCKLINGLY REMARKED THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS BARVILLE THAT HAD KNOCKED SPRINGER OUT SHORTLY BEFORE DARK PHIL
8887-281471-0026 CHANCING TO TAKE A CROSS CUT FROM MIDDLE STREET TO HIGH STREET OBSERVED ROY HOOKER PELTING AWAY WITH A BASEBALL AT THE WHITE SHINGLE ON THE BARN DRAWING NEAR PHIL ASKED ROY WHAT HE WAS DOING AND THE LATTER STARTLED AND PERSPIRING LOOKED ROUND
8887-281471-0027 OH IS IT YOU SAID ROY I THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WAS RACKLIFF I'M PRACTICING A LITTLE BY MY LONESOME THAT'S A HARD WAY TO PRACTICE SAID SPRINGER YOU CAN'T GET MUCH GOOD OUT OF THAT
8887-281471-0028 I'M GETTING SO I CAN HIT THAT SHINGLE ONCE IN A WHILE AND USE A CURVE TOO I COULDN'T SEEM TO HIT IT WITH A STRAIGHT BALL WHEN I BEGAN YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF PITCHING NOT QUITE AFTER WATCHING YOUR PERFORMANCE SATURDAY
8887-281471-0029 SEEING YOU SOAK A BATTER IN THE RIBS AND THEN HAND OUT FREE PASSES ENOUGH TO FORCE A RUN I CAME TO REALIZE WHAT CONTROL MEANS I'M TRYING TO GET IT PHIL FELT HIS FACE BURN CONTROL IS NECESSARY HE ADMITTED
8887-281471-0030 BUT IT ISN'T EVERYTHING WHEN I PUT THE BALL OVER THEY PUP POUNDED IT BUT THEY WOULDN'T IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR CHOKING AS HE REALIZED WHAT HE HAD SO NEARLY SAID HOOKER BIT HIS TONGUE
8887-281471-0031 THEN HE HASTENED TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION THAT SNAPPED SPRINGER'S SELF RESTRAINT THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO POUND GRANT MUCH AND HE APPEARED ABLE TO PUT THE BALL JUST ABOUT WHERE HE WANTED TO GRANT SNARLED PHIL FURIOUSLY
