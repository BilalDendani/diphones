770-43321-0000 MABEL SEATED IN THE GALLERY THAT EVENING BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S CHAIR
770-43321-0001 HOPING EACH TIME THAT TWENTY ONE O'CLOCK WAS NEARER THAN SHE FEARED SHE KNEW WELL ENOUGH BY NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT OF EUROPE WOULD NOT BE HALF A MINUTE EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER HIS TIME HIS SUPREME PUNCTUALITY WAS FAMOUS ALL OVER THE CONTINENT
770-43321-0002 HE HAD SAID TWENTY ONE SO IT WAS TO BE TWENTY ONE A SHARP BELL NOTE IMPINGED FROM BENEATH AND IN A MOMENT THE DRAWLING VOICE OF THE SPEAKER STOPPED ONCE MORE SHE LIFTED HER WRIST SAW THAT IT WANTED FIVE MINUTES OF THE HOUR
770-43321-0003 THEN SHE LEANED FORWARD FROM HER CORNER AND STARED DOWN INTO THE HOUSE A GREAT CHANGE HAD PASSED OVER IT AT THE METALLIC NOISE ALL DOWN THE LONG BROWN SEATS MEMBERS WERE SHIFTING AND ARRANGING THEMSELVES MORE DECOROUSLY UNCROSSING THEIR LEGS
770-43321-0004 SLIPPING THEIR HATS BENEATH THE LEATHER FRINGES AS SHE LOOKED TOO SHE SAW THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE COMING DOWN THE THREE STEPS FROM HIS CHAIR FOR ANOTHER WOULD NEED IT IN A FEW MOMENTS THE HOUSE WAS FULL FROM END TO END A LATE COMER RAN IN FROM THE TWILIGHT OF THE SOUTH DOOR
770-43321-0005 THE GALLERIES AT THE LOWER END WERE OCCUPIED TOO DOWN THERE WHERE SHE HAD FAILED TO OBTAIN A SEAT YET FROM ALL THE CROWDED INTERIOR THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT A SIBILANT WHISPERING
770-43321-0006 FROM THE PASSAGES BEHIND SHE COULD HEAR AGAIN THE QUICK BELL NOTE REPEAT ITSELF AS THE LOBBIES WERE CLEARED AND FROM PARLIAMENT SQUARE OUTSIDE ONCE MORE CAME THE HEAVY MURMUR OF THE CROWD THAT HAD BEEN INAUDIBLE FOR THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES WHEN THAT CEASED SHE WOULD KNOW THAT HE WAS COME
770-43321-0007 HOW STRANGE AND WONDERFUL IT WAS TO BE HERE ON THIS NIGHT OF ALL WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS TO SPEAK A MONTH AGO HE HAD ASSENTED TO A SIMILAR BILL IN GERMANY AND HAD DELIVERED A SPEECH ON THE SAME SUBJECT AT TURIN TO MORROW HE WAS TO BE IN SPAIN
770-43321-0008 NO ONE KNEW WHERE HE HAD BEEN DURING THE PAST WEEK A RUMOUR HAD SPREAD THAT HIS VOLOR HAD BEEN SEEN PASSING OVER LAKE COMO AND HAD BEEN INSTANTLY CONTRADICTED NO ONE KNEW EITHER WHAT HE WOULD SAY TO NIGHT IT MIGHT BE THREE WORDS OR TWENTY THOUSAND
770-43321-0009 THERE WERE A FEW CLAUSES IN THE BILL NOTABLY THOSE BEARING ON THE POINT AS TO WHEN THE NEW WORSHIP WAS TO BE MADE COMPULSORY ON ALL SUBJECTS OVER THE AGE OF SEVEN IT MIGHT BE HE WOULD OBJECT AND VETO THESE IN THAT CASE ALL MUST BE DONE AGAIN AND THE BILL RE PASSED
770-43321-0010 MABEL HERSELF WAS INCLINED TO THESE CLAUSES THEY PROVIDED THAT ALTHOUGH WORSHIP WAS TO BE OFFERED IN EVERY PARISH CHURCH OF ENGLAND ON THE ENSUING FIRST DAY OF OCTOBER THIS WAS NOT TO BE COMPULSORY ON ALL SUBJECTS TILL THE NEW YEAR
770-43321-0011 LIFE SUSTENANCE AND PATERNITY CELEBRATED ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH QUARTER SUNDAY WORSHIP WAS TO BE PURELY VOLUNTARY SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY MAN COULD REFUSE THIS HOMAGE THESE FOUR THINGS WERE FACTS
770-43321-0012 THEY WERE THE MANIFESTATIONS OF WHAT SHE CALLED THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD AND IF OTHERS CALLED THAT POWER GOD YET SURELY THESE OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS HIS FUNCTIONS WHERE THEN WAS THE DIFFICULTY IT WAS NOT AS IF CHRISTIAN WORSHIP WERE NOT PERMITTED UNDER THE USUAL REGULATIONS
770-43321-0013 CATHOLICS COULD STILL GO TO MASS AND YET APPALLING THINGS WERE THREATENED IN GERMANY NOT LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND PERSONS HAD ALREADY LEFT FOR ROME AND IT WAS RUMOURED THAT FORTY THOUSAND WOULD REFUSE THIS SIMPLE ACT OF HOMAGE A FEW DAYS HENCE IT BEWILDERED AND ANGERED HER TO THINK OF IT
770-43321-0014 FOR HERSELF THE NEW WORSHIP WAS A CROWNING SIGN OF THE TRIUMPH OF HUMANITY HER HEART HAD YEARNED FOR SOME SUCH THING AS THIS SOME PUBLIC CORPORATE PROFESSION OF WHAT ALL NOW BELIEVED SHE HAD SO RESENTED THE DULNESS OF FOLK WHO WERE CONTENT WITH ACTION
770-43321-0015 AND NEVER CONSIDERED ITS SPRINGS SURELY THIS INSTINCT WITHIN HER WAS A TRUE ONE SHE DESIRED TO STAND WITH HER FELLOWS IN SOME SOLEMN PLACE CONSECRATED NOT BY PRIESTS BUT BY THE WILL OF MAN TO HAVE AS HER INSPIRERS SWEET SINGING AND THE PEAL OF ORGANS
770-43321-0016 TO UTTER HER SORROW WITH THOUSANDS BESIDE HER AT HER OWN FEEBLENESS OF IMMOLATION BEFORE THE SPIRIT OF ALL TO SING ALOUD HER PRAISE OF THE GLORY OF LIFE AND TO OFFER BY SACRIFICE AND INCENSE AN EMBLEMATIC HOMAGE TO THAT FROM WHICH SHE DREW HER BEING
770-43321-0017 AND TO WHOM ONE DAY SHE MUST RENDER IT AGAIN AH THESE CHRISTIANS HAD UNDERSTOOD HUMAN NATURE SHE HAD TOLD HERSELF A HUNDRED TIMES IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD DEGRADED IT DARKENED LIGHT POISONED THOUGHT MISINTERPRETED INSTINCT
770-43321-0018 BUT THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD THAT MAN MUST WORSHIP MUST WORSHIP OR SINK FOR HERSELF SHE INTENDED TO GO AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK TO THE LITTLE OLD CHURCH HALF A MILE AWAY FROM HER HOME TO KNEEL THERE BEFORE THE SUNLIT SANCTUARY TO MEDITATE ON SWEET MYSTERIES
770-43321-0019 THE OPEN GANGWAYS THE GREAT MACE ON THE TABLE AND HEARD ABOVE THE MURMUR OF THE CROWD OUTSIDE AND THE DYING WHISPERS WITHIN HER OWN HEART BEAT SHE COULD NOT SEE HIM SHE KNEW HE WOULD COME IN FROM BENEATH THROUGH THE DOOR THAT NONE BUT HE MIGHT USE
770-43321-0020 STRAIGHT INTO THE SEAT BENEATH THE CANOPY BUT SHE WOULD HEAR HIS VOICE THAT MUST BE JOY ENOUGH FOR HER AH THERE WAS SILENCE NOW OUTSIDE THE SOFT ROAR HAD DIED HE HAD COME THEN
770-43321-0021 AND THROUGH SWIMMING EYES SHE SAW THE LONG RIDGES OF HEADS RISE BENEATH HER AND THROUGH DRUMMING EARS HEARD THE MURMUR OF MANY FEET ALL FACES LOOKED THIS WAY AND SHE WATCHED THEM AS A MIRROR TO SEE THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF HIS PRESENCE
770-43321-0022 THERE WAS A GENTLE SOBBING SOMEWHERE IN THE AIR WAS IT HER OWN OR ANOTHER'S THE CLICK OF A DOOR A GREAT MELLOW BOOMING OVER HEAD SHOCK AFTER SHOCK AS THE HUGE TENOR BELLS TOLLED THEIR THREE STROKES AND IN AN INSTANT
770-43321-0023 OVER THE WHITE FACES PASSED A RIPPLE AS IF SOME BREEZE OF PASSION SHOOK THE SOULS WITHIN THERE WAS A SWAYING HERE AND THERE
