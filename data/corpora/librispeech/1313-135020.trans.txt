1313-135020-0044 WE DON'T KNOW YOUR MAJESTY WAS THE REPLY BUT THIS IS ABSURD SAID ANN WITH A FROWN IF WE CAN'T GET TO RUGGEDO
1313-135020-0045 THEY ALL STOOD LOOKING FROM ONE ROAD TO ANOTHER IN PERPLEXITY THE PATHS RADIATED FROM THE LITTLE CLEARING LIKE THE RAYS OF THE MIDDAY SUN AND EACH PATH SEEMED LIKE ALL THE OTHERS FILES AND THE ROSE PRINCESS WHO HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME GOOD FRIENDS
1313-135020-0046 ADVANCED A LITTLE WAY ALONG ONE OF THE ROADS AND FOUND THAT IT WAS BORDERED BY PRETTY WILD FLOWERS WHY DON'T YOU ASK THE FLOWERS TO TELL YOU THE WAY HE SAID TO HIS COMPANION THE FLOWERS RETURNED THE PRINCESS SURPRISED AT THE QUESTION
1313-135020-0047 OF COURSE SAID FILES THE FIELD FLOWERS MUST BE SECOND COUSINS TO A ROSE PRINCESS AND I BELIEVE IF YOU ASK THEM THEY WILL TELL YOU SHE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AT THE FLOWERS THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF WHITE DAISIES GOLDEN BUTTERCUPS BLUEBELLS AND DAFFODILS GROWING BY THE ROADSIDE
1313-135020-0048 AND EACH FLOWER HEAD WAS FIRMLY SET UPON ITS SLENDER BUT STOUT STEM THERE WERE EVEN A FEW WILD ROSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE SIGHT OF THESE THAT GAVE THE PRINCESS COURAGE TO ASK THE IMPORTANT QUESTION SHE DROPPED TO HER KNEES FACING THE FLOWERS
