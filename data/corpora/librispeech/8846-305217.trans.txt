8846-305217-0000 WHO IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF THEIR CONVERSION SHOOK THEMSELVES WHOLLY FREE FROM THE TRAMMELS OF THE PAST AND NEVER LOOKED BACK AGAIN
8846-305217-0001 THOU HAST BROKEN MY BONDS IN SUNDER CRIES SAINT AUGUSTINE TO THEE WILL I OFFER THE SACRIFICE OF PRAISE HONOURS WEALTH PLEASURE
8846-305217-0002 AND DIDST COME IN THYSELF INSTEAD OF THEM AND I SANG TO THEE MY LORD GOD MY TRUE HONOUR MY RICHES AND MY SALVATION THE VACATION WAS CLOSE AT HAND AUGUSTINE RESOLVED TO GIVE UP HIS PROFESSORSHIP
8846-305217-0003 AND TO GO AWAY QUIETLY TO PREPARE HIMSELF FOR BAPTISM VERECUNDUS ONE OF THE LITTLE GROUP OF FAITHFUL FRIENDS WHO SURROUNDED HIM HAD A COUNTRY HOUSE IN CASSIACUM WHICH HE OFFERED FOR HIS USE WHILE HE REMAINED IN ITALY
8846-305217-0004 IT WAS A HAPPY PARTY THAT GATHERED WITHIN ITS WALLS THERE WERE AUGUSTINE AND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER NAVIGIUS THE FAITHFUL ALYPIUS WHO WAS TO RECEIVE BAPTISM WITH HIS FRIEND LICENTIUS AND TRIGETIUS AUGUSTINE'S TWO PUPILS
8846-305217-0005 AND SEVERAL OTHERS LASTLY THERE WAS MONICA WHO WAS A MOTHER TO THEM ALL AND WHOSE SUNNY PRESENCE DID MUCH TO ENLIVEN THE HOUSEHOLD IT WAS AUTUMN AN ITALIAN MID SEPTEMBER THE COUNTRY WAS A GLORY OF GREEN AND GOLD AND CRIMSON
8846-305217-0006 THE APENNINES LYING LIKE PURPLE SHADOWS IN THE DISTANCE HERE IN THE SECLUSION THAT WAS SO DEAR TO HIS HEART AUGUSTINE READ THE PSALMS FOR THE FIRST TIME HIS SOUL WAS ON FIRE WITH THEIR BEAUTY EVERY WORD CARRIED HIM TO GOD
8846-305217-0007 MONICA READ WITH HIM AND HE TELLS US THAT HE WOULD OFTEN TURN TO HER FOR AN EXPLANATION FOR HE CONTINUES SHE WAS WALKING STEADILY IN THE PATH IN WHICH I WAS AS YET FEELING MY WAY THERE WERE OTHER STUDIES BESIDES TO BE CARRIED ON
8846-305217-0008 AND SAINT AUGUSTINE TELLS US OF SOME OF THE INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE HELD ON THE LAWN OR IN THE HALL OF THE BATHS WHICH THEY USED WHEN THE WEATHER WAS NOT FINE ENOUGH TO GO OUT ONE MORNING
8846-305217-0009 WHEN HE AND HIS PUPILS WERE TALKING OF THE WONDERFUL HARMONY AND ORDER THAT EXIST IN NATURE THE DOOR OPENED AND MONICA LOOKED IN HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON SHE ASKED FOR SHE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DISCUSSING AUGUSTINE INVITED HER TO JOIN THEM BUT MONICA SMILED
8846-305217-0010 I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A WOMAN AMONGST THE PHILOSOPHERS SHE SAID THAT IS A MISTAKE REPLIED AUGUSTINE THERE WERE WOMEN PHILOSOPHERS AMONGST THE ANCIENTS AND YOU KNOW MY DEAR MOTHER THAT I LIKE YOUR PHILOSOPHY VERY MUCH
8846-305217-0011 PHILOSOPHY MEANS NOTHING ELSE BUT LOVE OF WISDOM NOW YOU LOVE WISDOM MORE EVEN THAN YOU LOVE ME AND I KNOW HOW MUCH THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SO FAR ADVANCED IN WISDOM THAT YOU FEAR NO ILL FORTUNE NOT EVEN DEATH ITSELF
8846-305217-0012 EVERYBODY SAYS THAT THIS IS THE VERY HEIGHT OF PHILOSOPHY I WILL THEREFORE SIT AT YOUR FEET AS YOUR DISCIPLE MONICA STILL SMILING TOLD HER SON THAT HE HAD NEVER TOLD SO MANY LIES IN HIS LIFE IN SPITE OF HER PROTESTS HOWEVER THEY WOULD NOT LET HER GO
8846-305217-0013 THE DISCUSSIONS SAYS SAINT AUGUSTINE OWED A GOOD DEAL OF THEIR BEAUTY TO HER PRESENCE THE FIFTEENTH OF NOVEMBER WAS AUGUSTINE'S BIRTHDAY
8846-305217-0014 THEIR SOULS MIGHT BE FED ALSO
8846-305217-0015 THAT WE ARE MADE UP OF SOUL AND BODY TO THIS EVERYBODY AGREED BUT NAVIGIUS WHO WAS INCLINED TO ARGUE AND WHO SAID HE DID NOT KNOW DO YOU MEAN ASKED AUGUSTINE THAT THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL THAT YOU DO KNOW
8846-305217-0016 OR THAT OF THE FEW THINGS YOU DO NOT KNOW THIS IS ONE NAVIGIUS WAS A LITTLE PUT OUT AT THIS QUESTION BUT THEY PACIFIED HIM AND AT LAST PERSUADED HIM TO SAY
8846-305217-0017 MUST NOT THE SOUL HAVE ITS FOOD TOO ASKED AUGUSTINE AND WHAT IS THAT FOOD IS IT NOT KNOWLEDGE MONICA AGREED TO THIS BUT TRIGETIUS OBJECTED WHY YOU YOURSELF SAID MONICA ARE A LIVING PROOF OF IT
8846-305217-0018 DID YOU NOT TELL US AT DINNER THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WERE EATING BECAUSE YOU WERE LOST IN THOUGHT YET YOUR TEETH WERE WORKING ALL THE TIME WHERE WAS YOUR SOUL AT THAT MOMENT IF NOT FEEDING TOO THEN AUGUSTINE REMINDING THEM THAT IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY
8846-305217-0019 SAID THAT AS HE HAD ALREADY GIVEN THEM A LITTLE FEAST FOR THE BODY HE WOULD NOW GIVE THEM ONE FOR THE SOUL WERE THEY HUNGRY HE ASKED THERE WAS AN EAGER CHORUS OF ASSENT CAN A MAN BE HAPPY HE SAID IF HE HAS NOT WHAT HE WANTS
8846-305217-0020 AND IS HE HAPPY IF HE HAS IT MONICA WAS THE FIRST TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION IF HE WANTS WHAT IS GOOD AND HAS IT SHE REPLIED HE IS HAPPY BUT IF HE WANTS WHAT IS BAD HE IS NOT HAPPY EVEN IF HE HAS IT
8846-305217-0021 WELL SAID MOTHER CRIED AUGUSTINE YOU HAVE REACHED THE HEIGHTS OF PHILOSOPHY AT A SINGLE BOUND SOMEONE THEN SAID THAT IF A MAN WERE NEEDY HE COULD NOT BE HAPPY FINALLY THEY ALL AGREED THAT ONLY HE WHO POSSESSED GOD
8846-305217-0022 COULD BE WHOLLY HAPPY BUT THE DISCUSSION HAD GONE ON FOR A LONG TIME AND AUGUSTINE SUGGESTED THAT THE SOUL MIGHT HAVE TOO MUCH NOURISHMENT AS WELL AS THE BODY AND THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO PUT OFF THE REST UNTIL TO MORROW THE DISCUSSION WAS CONTINUED NEXT DAY
8846-305217-0023 SINCE ONLY HE WHO POSSESSES GOD CAN BE HAPPY WHO IS HE WHO POSSESSES GOD ASKED AUGUSTINE AND THEY WERE ALL INVITED TO GIVE THEIR OPINION HE THAT LEADS A GOOD LIFE ANSWERED ONE HE WHO DOES GOD'S WILL SAID ANOTHER
8846-305217-0024 HE WHO IS PURE OF HEART SAID A THIRD NAVIGIUS WOULD NOT SAY ANYTHING BUT AGREED WITH THE LAST SPEAKER MONICA APPROVED OF THEM ALL SAINT AUGUSTINE CONTINUED IT IS GOD'S WILL THAT ALL SHOULD SEEK HIM
8846-305217-0025 OF COURSE THEY ALL REPLIED CAN HE WHO SEEKS GOD BE LEADING A BAD LIFE CERTAINLY NOT THEY SAID CAN A MAN WHO IS NOT PURE IN HEART SEEK GOD NO THEY AGREED THEN
8846-305217-0026 SAID AUGUSTINE WHAT HAVE WE HERE A MAN WHO LEADS A GOOD LIFE DOES GOD'S WILL AND IS PURE OF HEART IS SEEKING GOD BUT HE DOES NOT YET POSSESS HIM THEREFORE WE CANNOT UPHOLD THAT THEY WHO LEAD GOOD LIVES
8846-305217-0027 DO GOD'S WILL AND ARE PURE OF HEART POSSESS GOD THEY ALL LAUGHED AT THE TRAP IN WHICH HE HAD CAUGHT THEM BUT MONICA SAYING THAT SHE WAS SLOW TO GRASP THESE THINGS ASKED TO HAVE THE ARGUMENT REPEATED
8846-305217-0028 THEN SHE THOUGHT A MOMENT NO ONE CAN POSSESS GOD WITHOUT SEEKING HIM SHE SAID TRUE SAID AUGUSTINE BUT WHILE HE IS SEEKING HE DOES NOT YET POSSESS
8846-305217-0029 BUT THOSE WHO LIVE WELL HAVE HIM FOR THEIR FRIEND AND THOSE WHO LIVE BADLY MAKE THEMSELVES HIS ENEMIES LET US CHANGE THE STATEMENT HE WHO POSSESSES GOD IS HAPPY TO
8846-305217-0030 HE WHO HAS GOD FOR HIS FRIEND IS HAPPY ALL AGREED TO THIS BUT NAVIGIUS NO HE SAID FOR THIS REASON IF HE IS HAPPY WHO HAS GOD FOR HIS FRIEND AND GOD IS THE FRIEND OF THOSE WHO SEEK HIM
8846-305217-0031 AND THOSE WHO SEEK HIM DO NOT POSSESS HIM FOR TO THIS ALL HAVE AGREED THEN IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING GOD HAVE NOT WHAT THEY WANT AND WE ALL AGREED YESTERDAY THAT A MAN CANNOT BE HAPPY
8846-305217-0032 THAT HE WHO HAS FOUND GOD HAS HIM FOR HIS FRIEND AND IS HAPPY BUT HE WHO IS STILL SEEKING GOD HAS HIM FOR HIS FRIEND BUT IS NOT YET HAPPY HE HOWEVER WHO HAS SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM GOD BY SIN
8846-305217-0033 HAS NEITHER GOD FOR HIS FRIEND NOR IS HE HAPPY THIS SATISFIED EVERYBODY THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION WAS THEN CONSIDERED IN WHAT DID UNHAPPINESS CONSIST ASKED AUGUSTINE
8846-305217-0034 MONICA MAINTAINED THAT NEEDINESS AND UNHAPPINESS MUST GO TOGETHER
8846-305217-0035 NEEDY AND UNHAPPY AUGUSTINE THEN SUPPOSED A MAN WHO HAD EVERYTHING HE WANTED IN THIS WORLD COULD IT BE SAID THAT HE WAS NEEDY YET WAS IT CERTAIN THAT HE WAS HAPPY
8846-305217-0036 THAT FEAR REPLIED AUGUSTINE WOULD MAKE HIM UNHAPPY BUT WOULD NOT MAKE HIM NEEDY THEREFORE WE COULD HAVE A MAN WHO IS UNHAPPY WITHOUT BEING NEEDY TO THIS EVERYONE AGREED BUT MONICA
8846-305217-0037 WHO STILL ARGUED THAT UNHAPPINESS COULD NOT BE SEPARATED FROM NEEDINESS THIS SUPPOSED MAN OF YOURS SHE SAID RICH AND FORTUNATE STILL FEARS TO LOSE HIS GOOD FORTUNE THAT SHOWS THAT HE WANTS WISDOM
8846-305217-0038 CAN WE CALL A MAN WHO WANTS MONEY NEEDY AND NOT CALL HIM SO WHEN HE WANTS WISDOM AT THIS REMARK THERE WAS A GENERAL OUTCRY OF ADMIRATION IT WAS THE VERY ARGUMENT SAID AUGUSTINE THAT HE HAD MEANT TO USE HIMSELF
8846-305217-0039 NOTHING SAID LICENTIUS COULD HAVE BEEN MORE TRULY AND DIVINELY SAID WHAT INDEED IS MORE WRETCHED THAN TO LACK WISDOM AND THE WISE MAN CAN NEVER BE NEEDY WHATEVER ELSE HE LACKS
8846-305217-0040 AUGUSTINE THEN WENT ON TO DEFINE WISDOM THE WISDOM THAT MAKES US HAPPY HE SAID IS THE WISDOM OF GOD AND THE WISDOM OF GOD IS THE SON OF GOD PERFECT LIFE IS THE ONLY HAPPY LIFE
8846-305217-0041 HE CONTINUED AND TO THIS BY MEANS OF FIRM FAITH CHEERFUL HOPE AND BURNING LOVE WE SHALL SURELY BE BROUGHT IF WE BUT HASTEN TOWARDS IT SO THE DISCUSSION ENDED AND ALL WERE CONTENT
8846-305217-0042 OH CRIED TRIGETIUS HOW I WISH YOU WOULD PROVIDE US WITH A FEAST LIKE THIS EVERY DAY MODERATION IN ALL THINGS ANSWERED AUGUSTINE IF THIS HAS BEEN A PLEASURE TO YOU IT IS GOD ALONE THAT YOU MUST THANK
8846-305217-0043 SO THE HAPPY INNOCENT DAYS FLEW PAST IN THE PURSUIT OF THAT WISDOM WHICH IS ETERNAL
8846-305217-0044 O BEAUTY EVER ANCIENT EVER NEW CRIED AUGUSTINE BEHOLD THOU WAST WITHIN ME AND I WAS ABROAD AND THERE I SOUGHT THEE I HAVE TASTED THEE AND I AM HUNGRY AFTER THEE
8846-305217-0045 THOU HAST TOUCHED ME AND I AM ALL ON FIRE AT THE BEGINNING OF LENT AUGUSTINE AND ALYPIUS RETURNED TO MILAN TO ATTEND THE COURSE OF INSTRUCTIONS WHICH SAINT AMBROSE WAS TO GIVE TO THOSE WHO WERE PREPARING FOR BAPTISM
