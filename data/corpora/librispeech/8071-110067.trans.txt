8071-110067-0000 SECTION I OF BALLS I WAS GOING TO SAY LET US BEGIN WITH PRIVATE BALLS BUT I RECOLLECT THAT THIS DENOMINATION IS NO LONGER FASHIONABLE WE DO NOT SAY A BALL AT MADAM SUCH A ONE'S
8071-110067-0001 BUT AN EVENING PARTY SOIREE NEVERTHELESS WHEN WE WISH TO GIVE A DANCE WE GIVE THE INVITATIONS A WEEK BEFOREHAND
8071-110067-0002 IF IT IS TO BE A SIMPLE EVENING PARTY
8071-110067-0003 THE SOIREE IS TO BE IN REALITY A BALL THE INVITATIONS ARE WRITTEN OR WHAT IS BETTER PRINTED AND EXPRESSED IN THE THIRD PERSON A ROOM APPROPRIATED FOR DRESSES AND FURNISHED WITH CLOAK PINS TO HANG UP THE SHAWLS AND OTHER GARMENTS OF THE LADIES

8071-110067-0005 PROCURES SEATS FOR THEM AND THEN MINGLES AGAIN AMONG THE GENTLEMEN WHO ARE STANDING AND WHO FORM GROUPS OR WALK ABOUT THE ROOM THE TOILET OF ALL THE ASSEMBLY SHOULD BE MADE WITH GREAT CARE
8071-110067-0006 WOULD PASS FOR A PERSON OF BAD TON
8071-110067-0007 TO DANCE WITH YOU IF SHE ANSWERS THAT SHE IS ENGAGED INVITE HER FOR THE NEXT DANCE
8071-110067-0008 TO ANY LADIES NEXT TO HER FOR THESE NOT BEING ABLE TO REFUSE YOU WOULD FEEL HURT AT BEING INVITED AFTER ANOTHER NEVER WAIT UNTIL THE SIGNAL IS GIVEN TO TAKE A PARTNER FOR NOTHING IS MORE IMPOLITE THAN TO INVITE A LADY HASTILY
8071-110067-0009 AND WHEN THE DANCERS ARE ALREADY IN THEIR PLACES IT CAN BE ALLOWED ONLY WHEN THE SET IS INCOMPLETE A LADY CANNOT REFUSE THE INVITATION OF A GENTLEMAN TO DANCE UNLESS SHE HAS ALREADY ACCEPTED THAT OF ANOTHER
8071-110067-0010 FOR SHE WOULD BE GUILTY OF AN INCIVILITY WHICH MIGHT OCCASION TROUBLE SHE WOULD BESIDES SEEM TO SHOW CONTEMPT FOR HIM WHOM SHE REFUSED AND WOULD EXPOSE HERSELF TO RECEIVE AN ILL COMPLIMENT FROM HIM
8071-110067-0011 THE FORMER SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY ONE OR TWO OTHER MARRIED LADIES AND THE LATTER BY THEIR MOTHER OR BY A LADY TO REPRESENT HER WE SHOULD AVOID TALKING TOO MUCH IT WOULD OCCASION REMARKS AND HAVE A BAD APPEARANCE

8071-110067-0013 AND SHOULD SEE THAT THEY ARE INVITED TO DANCE HE MUST DO THIS WHOLLY UNPERCEIVED IN ORDER NOT TO WOUND THE SELF ESTEEM OF THE UNFORTUNATE LADIES GENTLEMEN WHOM THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE REQUESTS TO DANCE WITH THESE LADIES
8071-110067-0014 AND EVEN APPEAR PLEASED AT DANCING WITH A PERSON THUS RECOMMENDED TO THEIR NOTICE LADIES WHO DANCE MUCH OUGHT TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BOAST BEFORE THOSE WHO DANCE BUT LITTLE OR NOT AT ALL

8071-110067-0019 BEWARE ALSO OF TAKING YOUR PLACE IN A SET OF DANCERS MORE SKILFUL THAN YOURSELF WHEN AN UNPRACTISED DANCER MAKES A MISTAKE WE MAY APPRISE HIM OF HIS ERROR BUT IT WOULD BE VERY IMPOLITE
8071-110067-0020 IN A PRIVATE BALL OR PARTY IT IS PROPER TO SHOW STILL MORE RESERVE AND NOT TO MANIFEST MORE PREFERENCE FOR ONE LADY THAN ANOTHER WE SHOULD DANCE WITH ALL INDISCRIMINATELY BUT WE MAY MOREOVER
8071-110067-0021 INVITE THE SAME LADY MORE THAN ONCE IN PUBLIC BALLS A GENTLEMAN OFFERS HIS PARTNER REFRESHMENTS WHICH SHE VERY SELDOM ACCEPTS UNLESS SHE IS MUCH ACQUAINTED WITH HIM BUT IN PRIVATE PARTIES
8071-110067-0022 THE PERSONS WHO RECEIVE THE COMPANY SEND ROUND CAKE AND OTHER REFRESHMENTS OF WHICH EACH ONE HELPS HIMSELF AS HE PLEASES NEAR THE END OF THE EVENING
8071-110067-0023 THE WALTZ IS A DANCE OF QUITE TOO LOOSE A CHARACTER AND UNMARRIED LADIES SHOULD REFRAIN FROM IT IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
8071-110067-0024 MAY BE ALLOWED TO WALTZ IN PRIVATE BALLS IF IT IS VERY SELDOM AND WITH PERSONS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE IT IS INDISPENSABLE FOR THEM TO ACQUIT THEMSELVES WITH DIGNITY AND DECENCY
8071-110067-0025 I HAVE SPOKEN OF PUBLIC BALLS IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO PRIVATE ONES AND I MIGHT ALSO HAVE MENTIONED BALLS BY SUBSCRIPTION
8071-110067-0026 WE HAVE NOTHING TO ADVISE OUR READERS BUT TO SHUN THEM AS TO MASKED BALLS IT IS AN AMUSEMENT ALTOGETHER TO BE CONDEMNED EXCEPT THOSE OF THE OPERA
8071-110067-0027 WE SHOULD MAKE THEM DURING THE WEEK A VISIT OF THANKS AT WHICH WE MAY CONVERSE OF THE PLEASURE OF THE BALL AND OF THE GOOD SELECTION OF THE COMPANY SECTION TWO OF CONCERTS
8071-110067-0028 THE PROPRIETIES IN DEPORTMENT WHICH CONCERTS REQUIRE ARE LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN EVERY OTHER ASSEMBLY OR IN PUBLIC EXHIBITIONS FOR CONCERTS PARTAKE OF THE ONE AND THE OTHER
8071-110067-0029 THE LADIES OCCUPY THE FRONT SEATS AND THE GENTLEMEN ARE GENERALLY IN GROUPS BEHIND OR AT THE SIDE OF THEM ONE SHOULD OBSERVE THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE AND REFRAIN FROM BEATING TIME HUMMING THE AIRS APPLAUDING

8071-110067-0031 WHERE PERSONS ASSEMBLE TOGETHER AND AT THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS THERE ARE SOME GENERAL ATTENTIONS WHICH WE SHOULD MANIFEST TO THOSE PERSONS WHOM WE MEET THERE IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE TO JOSTLE CONTINUALLY AND IN AN IMPORTUNATE MANNER
8071-110067-0032 THOSE NEAR WHOM WE ARE PLACED TO STEP UPON THE DRESS OF A LADY OR RUN AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE MOVING AT A MODERATE PACE IF YOU GO WITH A PARTY TO A THEATRICAL ENTERTAINMENT

8071-110067-0034 AND AVOID LEANING OVER TOO MUCH
8071-110067-0035 GENTLEMEN SHOULD ADDRESS THEMSELVES TO THE ATTENDANTS AT THE BOXES MAKE THEM A COMPENSATION AND PLACE UNDER THEIR CARE THEIR HATS THE CLOAKS AND OTHER ARTICLES OF DRESS OF THE LADIES BUT WE MUST NOT HANG THEM OVER THE BOXES
