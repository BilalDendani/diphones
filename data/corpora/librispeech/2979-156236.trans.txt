2979-156236-0000 EVERYTHING IS GOING TO THE DOGS AT MY STATION I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BUY LAND AT A HIGH PRICE AND THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GREAT MISMANAGEMENT FROM THE ACCOUNTS I HEAR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS LIKE THE LAST AND I WILL BE A RUINED MAN
2979-156236-0001 IT IS VERY HARD THAT ONE CANNOT TAKE A SHORT HOLIDAY WITHOUT SUFFERING SO GRIEVOUSLY FOR IT WHAT WERE YOUR ACCOUNTS PHILLIPS I THINK YOU SAID THEY WERE RATHER UNSATISFACTORY
2979-156236-0002 WILL LOOK TO WIRIWILTA A LITTLE WHEN YOU RETURN AND SEND ME YOUR OPINION I HAD BETTER ENTRUST YOU WITH FULL POWERS TO ACT FOR ME FOR I SHOULD PREFER YOU AS MY ATTORNEY TO GRANT I HOPE HE WILL NOT BE OFFENDED AT THE TRANSFER SAID BRANDON OH I THINK NOT
2979-156236-0003 HE TOOK IT VERY RELUCTANTLY FOR HE SAID HIS OWN AFFAIRS WERE ENOUGH FOR HIM AND PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE THAN ENOUGH SAID BRANDON WITH A SMILE IN THAT CASE I WILL BE VERY GLAD TO DO ALL IN MY POWER FOR YOU
2979-156236-0004 I HAVE NO WISH TO RETURN TO AUSTRALIA SAID MISTER PHILLIPS IF I CAN POSSIBLY AFFORD TO LIVE HERE WITH A FAMILY LIKE MINE ENGLAND OFFERS SO MANY ADVANTAGES IN FACT
2979-156236-0005 AND THAT IS LONDON VERY TRUE IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO LIVE ON SAID BRANDON SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS I MUST GO NOW TO WORK AS HARD AS EVER TO GET THINGS SET TO RIGHTS AGAIN AND PERHAPS IN ANOTHER DOZEN OF YEARS
2979-156236-0006 WHEN I AM FEEBLE OLD AND GREY I MAY RETURN AND SPEND THE POOR REMNANT OF MY DAYS IN THIS DELIGHTFUL CENTRE OF CIVILIZATION BUT WITH ME FORTUNATELY THERE ARE ONLY THE TWO ALTERNATIVES EITHER LONDON OR THE BUSH OF AUSTRALIA
2979-156236-0007 THERE IS NO MIDDLE COURSE OF LIFE DESIRABLE IF I CANNOT ATTAIN THE ONE I MUST MAKE THE BEST OF THE OTHER HARRIETT PHILLIPS LISTENED TO ALL THIS
2979-156236-0008 SHE HAD NO FANCY FOR A TWELVE YEARS BANISHMENT FROM ENGLAND NOR FOR A ROUGH LIFE IN THE BUSH MISTER BRANDON HAD BEEN REPRESENTED TO HER AS A THRIVING SETTLER WHO HAD MADE MONEY SHE SAW THE VERY COMFORTABLE STYLE IN WHICH HER BROTHER LIVED
2979-156236-0009 AND SHE HAD NO OBJECTION TO SUCH AN ESTABLISHMENT FOR HERSELF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO PARTICULARLY FOND OF MISTER BRANDON AS TO ACCEPT FOR HIS SAKE A LIFE SO VERY DIFFERENT AND SO VERY MUCH INFERIOR SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN DECEIVED
2979-156236-0010 AND SHE DID NOT LIKE BEING DECEIVED OR MISTAKEN AND SHE STILL LESS LIKED TO MAKE MISTAKES AND INSTEAD OF BLAMING HERSELF SHE WAS ANGRY WITH EVERYONE ELSE HER BROTHER HER SISTER IN LAW
2979-156236-0011 BRANDON HIMSELF FOR LEADING HER TO BELIEVE THAT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THEY WERE OF COURSE HE WOULD ASK HER HE COULD NOT HELP DOING SO BUT AS TO ACCEPTING HIM THAT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT QUESTION
2979-156236-0012 SHE HAD PUT ON HER OLD BONNET WITH A GRUDGE AT ELSIE AND WHEN MISSUS PHILLIPS APPEARED IN THE DRAWING ROOM READY FOR THE PARTY TO THE EXHIBITION IN ALL THE SPLENDOUR OF HER NEW ONE WHICH REALLY LOOKED LOVELY AND SHE LOVELY IN IT
2979-156236-0013 AND HARRIETT CAUGHT THE REFLECTION OF BOTH FIGURES IN THE LARGE MIRROR SHE FELT STILL MORE DISSATISFIED WITH EVERYBODY THAN SHE HAD DONE BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN WERE READY AND THEY WERE JUST ABOUT TO START WHEN A LIGHT QUICK STEP CAME TO THE DOOR AND A LITTLE TAP WAS HEARD
2979-156236-0014 HARRIETT OPENED IT AND WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ELSIE HOLDING IN HER HAND THE SECOND BONNET COMPLETED EQUALLY BEAUTIFUL EQUALLY TASTEFUL AND APPARENTLY QUITE AS EXPENSIVE OH
2979-156236-0015 LOOK AT ALICE'S CLEVER HANDIWORK AND ALICE WAS INTRODUCED A LITTLE UNWILLINGLY INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO BE COMPLIMENTED ON HER TASTE AND HER DESPATCH AND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH THE TWO GENTLEMEN MISS PHILLIPS WAS TOO MUCH ENGROSSED WITH HER BONNET
2979-156236-0016 AND WITH THE IMPROVEMENT IT WOULD MAKE IN HER APPEARANCE TO OBSERVE THE EARNEST ANXIOUS LOOKS OF HER TWO FANCIED ADMIRERS AS THEY GREETED HER SISTER'S LADY'SMAID OR THAT THEY LOOKED WITH INTEREST AND CONCERN ON HER TIRED FACE
2979-156236-0017 WHICH THOUGH NOW A LITTLE FLUSHED WITH EXCITEMENT BORE TO THOSE WHO KNEW THE CIRCUMSTANCES TRACES OF HAVING BEEN UP VERY LATE AND VERY EARLY OVER HER WORK I KNEW SHE COULD DO IT HARRIETT WHISPERED TO MISTER BRANDON WHEN ALICE LEFT THE ROOM
2979-156236-0018 SHE IS SO EXCESSIVELY QUICK I NEVER WOULD HAVE SAID SO MUCH ABOUT IT YESTERDAY IF I HAD NOT KNOWN SHE COULD EASILY DO IT AND DOES NOT MINE LOOK AS WELL AS MISSUS PHILLIPS'S I SAID IT WOULD AND SO SHE ACCEPTED MISTER HOGARTH'S ARM
2979-156236-0019 AND WENT TO SEE THE PICTURES WITH A BETTER JUDGE THAN BRANDON IN ALL THE TRIUMPH OF HER NEW BONNET THE LIGHTEST THE MOST BECOMING SHE HAD EVER HAD IN HER LIFE BUT HER INFLUENCE WITH WALTER BRANDON WAS LOST FOR EVER
2979-156236-0020 WITH HER GOOD COMMON SENSE OR ELSIE WITH HER SWEET VOICE AND WINNING WAYS HANGING ON HIS ARM INSTEAD OF MISSUS PHILLIPS WHO WAS VERY UNINTERESTING TO HIM THOUGH HER GREAT BEAUTY AND EXCELLENT STYLE OF DRESS MADE HER AN OBJECT OF INTEREST TO OTHER PEOPLE
2979-156236-0021 AND WHO ALWAYS ENJOYED BEING WELL STARED AT IN PUBLIC PLACES BUT JANE WAS ENGAGED WITH HER PUPILS AT THIS TIME AND ELSIE WAS ALWAYS KEPT VERY BUSY SO THAT NEITHER OF THEM COULD ACCOMPANY THE PARTY AND FRANCIS HOGARTH FELT DISAPPOINTED
2979-156236-0022 FOR HE HAD ANTICIPATED THE SOCIETY OF ONE OR BOTH OF THEM HOW CURIOUSLY THE EGOTIST
2979-156236-0023 HOW HARRIETT PHILLIPS WOULD HAVE STARTED IF SHE COULD HAVE READ THE HEARTS OF HOGARTH AND BRANDON AND SEEN WHAT A VERY INFINITESIMAL SHARE SHE HAD IN EITHER FRANCIS WAS ONLY IMPELLED TO PAY ATTENTION TO MISS PHILLIPS BY HIS NATURAL SENSE OF POLITENESS
2979-156236-0024 AND BY THE WISH TO MAKE THE SITUATION OF HIS COUSINS IN THE FAMILY PLEASANT AS FAR AS IT LAY IN HIS POWER TO DO SO WHILE BRANDON WHO HAD AT LAST STRUCK THE KEY NOTE OF HARRIETT'S CHARACTER WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND NEW PROOFS OF HER SELFISHNESS
2979-156236-0025 AND EGOTISM PEEPING OUT IN THE MOST TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCES HE OBSERVED HOW DIFFERENT HER MANNER WAS TOWARDS HIM NOW THAT A MAN OF PROPERTY IN THE OLD COUNTRY HAD APPEARED IN THE CIRCLE OF HER ACQUAINTANCES
2979-156236-0026 AND HE COULD NOT FAIL TO SEE THAT AN ADDITIONAL COLDNESS HAD COME OVER HER WHEN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LESS FLOURISHING AND THIS MADE HIM RATHER DISPOSED
2979-156236-0027 IN DERBYSHIRE
2979-156236-0028 GEORGIANA GAVE WAY TO HER SO MUCH SHE HAD APPEARED MORE AMIABLE THAN SHE DID NOW THE ARMED NEUTRALITY WHICH SHE MAINTAINED WITH HER SISTER IN LAW HAD AMUSED BRANDON AT FIRST BUT NOW IT APPEARED TO HIM TO BE UNLADYLIKE AND UNGRACEFUL TO ACCEPT
2979-156236-0029 OF HOSPITALITY IN HER BROTHER'S HOUSE WITHOUT ANY GRATITUDE OR ANY FORBEARANCE HE BEGAN TO QUESTION THE REALITY OF HER VERY GREAT SUPERIORITY OVER MISSUS PHILLIPS WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES OF EDUCATION AND SOCIETY
2979-156236-0030 SHE OUGHT TO HAVE SHOWN MORE GENTLENESS AND AFFECTION BOTH TO HER BROTHER'S WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN HE ANALYSED AS HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE HER EXPRESSIONS AND WEIGHED HER OPINIONS AND FOUND THEY GENERALLY HAD MORE SOUND THAN SENSE
2979-156236-0031 AND HER HABITUAL ASSUMPTION THAT SHE KNEW EVERYTHING MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAME TIRESOME WHEN HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN HER SUPERIORITY HE BEGAN TOO TO CONTRAST THE CHARM OF A FACE
2979-156236-0032 WITH THAT OF ONE SO UNIMPRESSIBLE AS HARRIETT PHILLIPS'S WHOSE SELF POSSESSION WAS NEARLY AS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF JANE MELVILLE AS IT WAS FROM THE TIMIDITY AND DIFFIDENCE OF ELSIE
2979-156236-0033 JANE'S CALMNESS WAS THE RESULT OF A STRONG WILL MASTERING THE STRONG EMOTIONS WHICH SHE REALLY FELT AND NOT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY POWERFUL FEELING OR EMOTION WHATEVER BRANDON HAD LEARNED TO LIKE JANE BETTER AS HE KNEW MORE OF HER
2979-156236-0034 AND RATHER ENJOYED BEING PREACHED TO BY ONE WHO COULD PRACTISE AS WELL AS PREACH HE FELT THAT IF SHE WAS SUPERIOR TO HIM SHE DID NOT LOOK DOWN ON HIM AND SHE CERTAINLY HAD THE POWER OF MAKING HIM SPEAK WELL AND OF BRINGING OUT THE VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF REAL USEFUL PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE
2979-156236-0035 THAT HE HAD ACQUIRED IN HIS AUSTRALIAN LIFE
2979-156236-0036 FOR ALL THINGS AND PEOPLE COLONIAL BUT ABOVE ALL MISS PHILLIPS'S WANT OF CONSIDERATION FOR ALICE MELVILLE HAD WEANED MISTER BRANDON'S HEART FROM HER
