6709-74041-0000 THE COOK HOUSE STOOD AT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE BIG HOUSE AND EVERY EVENING AFTER SUPPER IT WAS FULL OF LIGHT AND NOISE AND LAUGHTER
6709-74041-0001 AND MAINTAINED THERE WAS NOTHING STOVE COOKED THAT COULD HOPE TO RIVAL THE RICH AND NUTTY FLAVOR OF ASH CAKE OR GREENS
6709-74041-0002 THE NOISE AND LAUGHTER CAME FROM A CIRCLE OF DUSKY AND ADMIRING FRIENDS
6709-74041-0003 AND THOUGH HUNCHBACKED AND HOMELY HAD NEVERTHELESS HAD HER PICK AS SHE WAS FOND OF BOASTING OF THE LIKELIEST LOOKING MEN ON THE PLACE AND THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN TWICE WEDDED AND TWICE WIDOWED
6709-74041-0004 ASPIRANTS WERE NOT WANTING FOR THE POSITION NOW VACANT FOR A THIRD TIME
6709-74041-0005 THE BURLY YOUNG OX CART DRIVER ON HIS KNEES PLEADING VERY EARNESTLY WITH THE ELDERLY AND HUMPBACKED LITTLE COOK WHILE DINNER SIMMERED ON AND ON UNNOTICED AND FORGOTTEN
6709-74041-0006 THESE THINGS WERE APT TO HAPPEN AT ANY TIME OR PLACE
6709-74041-0007 AND NO ONE COULD WITH ANY SHOW OF REASON EXPECT HER NOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO HIM SHE RULED EVERYBODY HER WHITE FOLKS INCLUDED
6709-74041-0008 UNLESS SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE COMMANDING SPIRITS AND BORN LEADERS WHO SOMETIMES APPEAR EVEN IN THE HUMBLEST WALKS OF LIFE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HER UNCOMMONLY STRONG WILL COMPELLED THE AFFECTIONS OF HER MALE ADMIRERS
6709-74041-0009 BUT IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SHE CONDESCENDED TO FLATTER AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT SHE FED THEM WELL ONE NIGHT BETWEEN SUPPER AND BEDTIME THE CHILDREN HEARD THE SOUND OF A BANJO PROCEEDING FROM THE COOK HOUSE
6709-74041-0010 THE SOUND OF PATTING AND THE THUD OF FEET KEEPING TIME TO THE MUSIC DREW THEM IRRESISTIBLY AUNT NANCY WAS THERE IN THE CIRCLE ABOUT THE EMBERS AS WAS ALSO HER OLD TIME FOE AUNT PHRONY
6709-74041-0011 AND THE BANJO WAS IN THE HANDS OF TIM A PLOW BOY CELEBRATED AS BEING THE BEST PICKER FOR MILES AROUND
6709-74041-0012 WHOSE HOPES SHE COULD NOT HAVE ENTIRELY QUENCHED
6709-74041-0013 AUNT NANCY LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE FEELING AROUND IN THE DUSK OF HALF FORGOTTEN THINGS FOR A DIMLY REMEMBERED STORY
6709-74041-0014 WHICH MIGHT PLEASE THE COMPANY IF THEY WERE NOT TOO HARD TO SUIT
