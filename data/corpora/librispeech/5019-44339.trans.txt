5019-44339-0000 FATHER BENWELL'S CORRESPONDENCE TO THE SECRETARY S J ROME WHEN I WROTE LAST I HARDLY THOUGHT I SHOULD TROUBLE YOU AGAIN SO SOON THE NECESSITY HAS HOWEVER ARISEN
5019-44339-0001 I MUST ASK FOR INSTRUCTIONS FROM OUR MOST REVEREND GENERAL ON THE SUBJECT OF ARTHUR PENROSE I BELIEVE THAT I INFORMED YOU THAT I DECIDED TO DEFER MY NEXT VISIT TO TEN ACRES LODGE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS
5019-44339-0002 IN ORDER THAT WINTERFIELD IF HE INTENDED TO DO SO MIGHT HAVE TIME TO COMMUNICATE WITH MISSUS ROMAYNE AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE COUNTRY NATURALLY ENOUGH PERHAPS CONSIDERING THE DELICACY OF THE SUBJECT
5019-44339-0003 HE HAS NOT TAKEN ME INTO HIS CONFIDENCE I CAN ONLY GUESS THAT HE HAS MAINTAINED THE SAME RESERVE WITH MISSUS ROMAYNE MY VISIT TO THE LODGE WAS DULY PAID THIS AFTERNOON
5019-44339-0004 I ASKED FIRST OF COURSE FOR THE LADY OF THE HOUSE AND HEARING SHE WAS IN THE GROUNDS JOINED HER THERE SHE LOOKED ILL AND ANXIOUS AND SHE RECEIVED ME WITH RIGID POLITENESS FORTUNATELY
5019-44339-0005 MISSUS EYRECOURT NOW CONVALESCENT WAS STAYING AT TEN ACRES AND WAS THEN TAKING THE AIR IN HER CHAIR ON WHEELS THE GOOD LADY'S NIMBLE AND DISCURSIVE TONGUE OFFERED ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF REFERRING
5019-44339-0006 IN THE MOST INNOCENT MANNER POSSIBLE TO WINTERFIELD'S FAVORABLE OPINION OF ROMAYNE'S PICTURES I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT I LOOKED AT ROMAYNE'S WIFE WHEN I MENTIONED THE NAME SHE TURNED PALE
5019-44339-0007 PROBABLY FEARING THAT I HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HER LETTER WARNING WINTERFIELD NOT TO TRUST ME IF SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN INFORMED THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE BLAMED BUT TO BE PITIED IN THE MATTER OF THE MARRIAGE AT BRUSSELS
5019-44339-0008 SUCH AT LEAST IS MY EXPERIENCE DRAWN FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF OTHER DAYS
5019-44339-0009 I VENTURED INTO THE HOUSE TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO ROMAYNE HE WAS IN THE STUDY AND HIS EXCELLENT FRIEND AND SECRETARY WAS WITH HIM AFTER THE FIRST GREETINGS PENROSE LEFT US
5019-44339-0010 HIS MANNER TOLD ME PLAINLY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG I ASKED NO QUESTIONS WAITING ON THE CHANCE THAT ROMAYNE MIGHT ENLIGHTEN ME
5019-44339-0011 I SAID I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE PENROSE WITH ME HE ANSWERED AND THEN HE FROWNED AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE TWO LADIES IN THE GROUNDS
5019-44339-0012 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT MISSUS EYRECOURT MIGHT BE OCCUPYING THE CUSTOMARY FALSE POSITION OF A MOTHER IN LAW I WAS MISTAKEN HE WAS NOT THINKING OF HIS WIFE'S MOTHER HE WAS THINKING OF HIS WIFE
5019-44339-0013 I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW THAT PENROSE HAD AN IDEA OF CONVERTING ME HE SAID SUDDENLY I WAS PERFECTLY CANDID WITH HIM I SAID I KNEW IT AND APPROVED OF IT
5019-44339-0014 MAY I HOPE THAT ARTHUR HAS SUCCEEDED IN CONVINCING YOU I VENTURED TO ADD HE MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED FATHER BENWELL IF HE HAD CHOSEN TO GO ON THIS REPLY AS YOU MAY EASILY IMAGINE TOOK ME BY SURPRISE
5019-44339-0015 ARE YOU REALLY SO OBDURATE THAT ARTHUR DESPAIRS OF YOUR CONVERSION I ASKED NOTHING OF THE SORT I HAVE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT OF IT AND I CAN TELL YOU I WAS MORE THAN READY TO MEET HIM HALF WAY
5019-44339-0016 THEN WHERE IS THE OBSTACLE I EXCLAIMED HE POINTED THROUGH THE WINDOW TO HIS WIFE THERE IS THE OBSTACLE HE SAID IN A TONE OF IRONICAL RESIGNATION KNOWING ARTHUR'S CHARACTER AS I KNEW IT
5019-44339-0017 I AT LAST UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAD HAPPENED FOR A MOMENT I FELT REALLY ANGRY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE WISE COURSE WAS TO SAY NOTHING UNTIL I COULD BE SURE OF SPEAKING WITH EXEMPLARY MODERATION
5019-44339-0018 IT DOESN'T DO FOR A MAN IN MY POSITION TO SHOW ANGER ROMAYNE WENT ON WE TALKED OF MY WIFE FATHER BENWELL THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU ONLY KNEW THEN THAT HER RECEPTION OF MISTER WINTERFIELD
5019-44339-0019 HAD DETERMINED HIM NEVER TO ENTER MY HOUSE AGAIN BY WAY OF ADDING TO YOUR INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT OF PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT I MAY NOW TELL YOU THAT MISSUS ROMAYNE HAS FORBIDDEN PENROSE TO PROCEED WITH THE ATTEMPT TO CONVERT ME
5019-44339-0020 BY COMMON CONSENT THE SUBJECT IS NEVER MENTIONED BETWEEN US THE BITTER IRONY OF HIS TONE THUS FAR SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED HE SPOKE EAGERLY AND ANXIOUSLY
5019-44339-0021 HE SAID BY THIS TIME MY LITTLE FIT OF ILL TEMPER WAS AT AN END I ANSWERED AND IT WAS REALLY IN A CERTAIN SENSE TRUE I KNOW ARTHUR TOO WELL TO BE ANGRY WITH HIM
5019-44339-0022 ROMAYNE SEEMED TO BE RELIEVED I ONLY TROUBLED YOU WITH THIS LAST DOMESTIC INCIDENT HE RESUMED TO BESPEAK YOUR INDULGENCE FOR PENROSE
5019-44339-0023 I AM GETTING LEARNED IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE CHURCH FATHER BENWELL YOU ARE THE SUPERIOR OF MY DEAR LITTLE FRIEND AND YOU EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER HIM OH HE IS THE KINDEST AND BEST OF MEN IT IS NOT HIS FAULT
5019-44339-0024 HE SUBMITS TO MISSUS ROMAYNE AGAINST HIS OWN BETTER CONVICTION IN THE HONEST BELIEF THAT HE CONSULTS THE INTERESTS OF OUR MARRIED LIFE
5019-44339-0025 THAT THIS SECOND INDISCREET INTERFERENCE OF HIS WIFE BETWEEN HIS FRIEND AND HIMSELF WILL PRODUCE THE VERY RESULT WHICH SHE DREADS MARK MY WORDS WRITTEN AFTER THE CLOSEST OBSERVATION OF HIM
5019-44339-0026 THIS NEW IRRITATION OF ROMAYNE'S SENSITIVE SELF RESPECT WILL HASTEN HIS CONVERSION
5019-44339-0027 IS TO FILL THE PLACE FROM WHICH PENROSE HAS WITHDRAWN I ABSTAINED FROM BREATHING A WORD OF THIS TO ROMAYNE IT IS HE IF I CAN MANAGE IT WHO MUST INVITE ME TO COMPLETE THE WORK OF CONVERSION
5019-44339-0028 AND BESIDES NOTHING CAN BE DONE UNTIL THE VISIT OF PENROSE HAS COME TO AN END ROMAYNE'S SECRET SENSE OF IRRITATION MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO DEVELOP ITSELF WITH TIME TO HELP IT
5019-44339-0029 I CHANGED THE CONVERSATION TO THE SUBJECT OF HIS LITERARY LABORS THE PRESENT STATE OF HIS MIND IS NOT FAVORABLE TO WORK OF THAT EXACTING KIND EVEN WITH THE HELP OF PENROSE TO ENCOURAGE HIM HE DOES NOT GET ON TO HIS SATISFACTION
5019-44339-0030 AND YET AS I COULD PLAINLY PERCEIVE THE AMBITION TO MAKE A NAME IN THE WORLD EXERCISES A STRONGER INFLUENCE OVER HIM THAN EVER ALL IN OUR FAVOR MY REVEREND FRIEND ALL IN OUR FAVOR
5019-44339-0031 I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF ASKING TO SEE PENROSE ALONE FOR A MOMENT AND THIS REQUEST GRANTED ROMAYNE AND I PARTED CORDIALLY I CAN MAKE MOST PEOPLE LIKE ME WHEN I CHOOSE TO TRY
5019-44339-0032 IS NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE DID I TELL YOU BY THE BY THAT THE PROPERTY HAS A LITTLE DECLINED OF LATE IN VALUE IT IS NOW NOT WORTH MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND A YEAR WE WILL IMPROVE IT WHEN IT RETURNS TO THE CHURCH
5019-44339-0033 MY INTERVIEW WITH PENROSE WAS OVER IN TWO MINUTES DISPENSING WITH FORMALITY I TOOK HIS ARM AND LED HIM INTO THE FRONT GARDEN I HAVE HEARD ALL ABOUT IT
5019-44339-0034 BUT I KNOW YOUR DISPOSITION AND I MAKE ALLOWANCES YOU HAVE QUALITIES DEAR ARTHUR WHICH PERHAPS
5019-44339-0035 I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO REPORT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE BUT YOU MAY TRUST ME TO PUT IT FAVORABLY SHAKE HANDS MY SON AND WHILE WE ARE STILL TOGETHER LET US BE AS GOOD FRIENDS AS EVER
5019-44339-0036 YOU MAY THINK THAT I SPOKE IN THIS WAY WITH A VIEW TO MY INDULGENT LANGUAGE BEING REPEATED TO ROMAYNE AND SO IMPROVING THE POSITION WHICH I HAVE ALREADY GAINED IN HIS ESTIMATION DO YOU KNOW I REALLY BELIEVE I MEANT IT AT THE TIME
5019-44339-0037 THE POOR FELLOW GRATEFULLY KISSED MY HAND WHEN I OFFERED IT TO HIM HE WAS NOT ABLE TO SPEAK I WONDER WHETHER I AM WEAK ABOUT ARTHUR SAY A KIND WORD FOR HIM WHEN HIS CONDUCT COMES UNDER NOTICE
5019-44339-0038 BUT PRAY DON'T MENTION THIS LITTLE FRAILTY OF MINE AND DON'T SUPPOSE I HAVE ANY SYMPATHY WITH HIS WEAK MINDED SUBMISSION TO MISSUS ROMAYNE'S PREJUDICES IF I EVER FELT THE SMALLEST CONSIDERATION FOR HER AND I CANNOT CALL TO MIND
5019-44339-0039 IN CLOSING THIS LETTER I MAY QUIET THE MINDS OF OUR REVEREND BRETHREN IF I ASSURE THEM THAT MY FORMER OBJECTION TO ASSOCIATING MYSELF DIRECTLY WITH THE CONVERSION OF ROMAYNE NO LONGER EXISTS
5019-44339-0040 YES EVEN AT MY AGE AND WITH MY HABITS I AM NOW RESIGNED TO HEARING AND CONFUTING
5019-44339-0041 I SHALL WRITE A CAREFULLY GUARDED LETTER TO ROMAYNE ON THE DEPARTURE OF PENROSE AND I SHALL SEND HIM A BOOK TO READ
5019-44339-0042 ARTHUR HAS BEEN BEFOREHAND WITH ME THERE
5019-44339-0043 I LOOK TO THAT ESSENTIALLY READABLE BOOK TO EXCITE ROMAYNE'S IMAGINATION BY VIVID DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHURCH AND THE VAST INFLUENCE AND POWER OF THE HIGHER PRIESTHOOD
5019-44339-0044 DOES THIS SUDDEN ENTHUSIASM OF MINE SURPRISE YOU AND ARE YOU ALTOGETHER AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IT MEANS MY FRIEND THAT I SEE OUR POSITION TOWARD ROMAYNE IN A NEW LIGHT
5019-44339-0045 FORGIVE ME IF I SAY NO MORE FOR THE PRESENT I PREFER TO BE SILENT
