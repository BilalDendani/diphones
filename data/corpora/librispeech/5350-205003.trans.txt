5350-205003-0000 THE EXASPERATING LITTLE BRATS OF TWINS BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN AND JACKY THREW THE BALL OUT TOWARDS THE SEA AND THEY BOTH RAN AFTER IT LITTLE MONKEYS COMMON AS DITCHWATER
5350-205003-0001 SOMEONE OUGHT TO TAKE THEM AND GIVE THEM A GOOD HIDING FOR THEMSELVES TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACES THE BOTH OF THEM AND CISSY AND EDY SHOUTED AFTER THEM TO COME BACK BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THE TIDE MIGHT COME IN ON THEM AND BE DROWNED JACKY TOMMY
5350-205003-0002 NOT THEY WHAT A GREAT NOTION THEY HAD SO CISSY SAID IT WAS THE VERY LAST TIME SHE'D EVER BRING THEM OUT SHE JUMPED UP AND CALLED THEM AND SHE RAN DOWN THE SLOPE PAST HIM TOSSING HER HAIR BEHIND HER
5350-205003-0003 BUT WITH ALL THE THINGAMERRY SHE WAS ALWAYS RUBBING INTO IT SHE COULDN'T GET IT TO GROW LONG BECAUSE IT WASN'T NATURAL SO SHE COULD JUST GO AND THROW HER HAT AT IT SHE RAN WITH LONG GANDERY STRIDES
5350-205003-0004 IT WAS A WONDER SHE DIDN'T RIP UP HER SKIRT AT THE SIDE THAT WAS TOO TIGHT ON HER BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF THE TOMBOY ABOUT CISSY CAFFREY AND SHE WAS A FORWARD PIECE WHENEVER SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW AND JUST BECAUSE SHE WAS A GOOD RUNNER
5350-205003-0005 SHE RAN LIKE THAT SO THAT HE COULD SEE ALL THE END OF HER PETTICOAT RUNNING AND HER SKINNY SHANKS UP AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IT WOULD HAVE SERVED HER JUST RIGHT IF SHE HAD TRIPPED UP OVER SOMETHING ACCIDENTALLY ON PURPOSE
5350-205003-0006 WITH HER HIGH CROOKED FRENCH HEELS ON HER TO MAKE HER LOOK TALL AND GOT A FINE TUMBLE TABLEAU THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY CHARMING EXPOSE FOR A GENTLEMAN LIKE THAT TO WITNESS QUEEN OF ANGELS QUEEN OF PATRIARCHS
5350-205003-0007 QUEEN OF PROPHETS OF ALL SAINTS THEY PRAYED QUEEN OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY AND THEN FATHER CONROY HANDED THE THURIBLE TO CANON O'HANLON AND HE PUT IN THE INCENSE AND CENSED THE BLESSED SACRAMENT
5350-205003-0008 AND CISSY CAFFREY CAUGHT THE TWO TWINS AND SHE WAS ITCHING TO GIVE THEM A RINGING GOOD CLIP ON THE EAR BUT SHE DIDN'T BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE WATCHING BUT SHE NEVER MADE A BIGGER MISTAKE IN ALL HER LIFE
5350-205003-0009 BECAUSE GERTY COULD SEE WITHOUT LOOKING THAT HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF OF HER AND THEN CANON O'HANLON HANDED THE THURIBLE BACK TO FATHER CONROY AND KNELT DOWN LOOKING UP AT THE BLESSED SACRAMENT AND THE CHOIR BEGAN TO SING THE TANTUM ERGO
5350-205003-0010 TO THE TANTUMER GOSA CRAMEN TUM THREE AND ELEVEN SHE PAID FOR THOSE STOCKINGS IN SPARROW'S OF GEORGE'S STREET ON THE TUESDAY NO THE MONDAY BEFORE EASTER AND THERE WASN'T A BRACK ON THEM AND THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT TRANSPARENT
5350-205003-0011 AND NOT AT HER INSIGNIFICANT ONES THAT HAD NEITHER SHAPE NOR FORM THE CHEEK OF HER BECAUSE HE HAD EYES IN HIS HEAD TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE FOR HIMSELF CISSY CAME UP ALONG THE STRAND WITH THE TWO TWINS AND THEIR BALL
5350-205003-0012 WITH HER HAT ANYHOW ON HER TO ONE SIDE AFTER HER RUN AND SHE DID LOOK A STREEL TUGGING THE TWO KIDS ALONG WITH THE FLIMSY BLOUSE SHE BOUGHT ONLY A FORTNIGHT BEFORE LIKE A RAG ON HER BACK AND A BIT OF HER PETTICOAT HANGING LIKE A CARICATURE
5350-205003-0013 GERTY JUST TOOK OFF HER HAT FOR A MOMENT TO SETTLE HER HAIR AND A PRETTIER A DAINTIER HEAD OF NUTBROWN TRESSES WAS NEVER SEEN ON A GIRL'S SHOULDERS A RADIANT LITTLE VISION IN SOOTH ALMOST MADDENING IN ITS SWEETNESS
5350-205003-0014 YOU WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL MANY A LONG MILE BEFORE YOU FOUND A HEAD OF HAIR THE LIKE OF THAT SHE COULD ALMOST SEE THE SWIFT ANSWERING FLASH OF ADMIRATION IN HIS EYES THAT SET HER TINGLING IN EVERY NERVE SHE PUT ON HER HAT SO THAT SHE COULD SEE FROM UNDERNEATH THE BRIM
5350-205003-0015 AND SWUNG HER BUCKLED SHOE FASTER FOR HER BREATH CAUGHT AS SHE CAUGHT THE EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES
5350-205003-0016 HER WOMAN'S INSTINCT TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD RAISED THE DEVIL IN HIM AND AT THE THOUGHT A BURNING SCARLET SWEPT FROM THROAT TO BROW TILL THE LOVELY COLOUR OF HER FACE BECAME A GLORIOUS ROSE EDY BOARDMAN WAS NOTICING IT TOO
5350-205003-0017 BECAUSE SHE WAS SQUINTING AT GERTY HALF SMILING WITH HER SPECS LIKE AN OLD MAID PRETENDING TO NURSE THE BABY IRRITABLE LITTLE GNAT SHE WAS AND ALWAYS WOULD BE AND THAT WAS WHY NO ONE COULD GET ON WITH HER POKING HER NOSE INTO WHAT WAS NO CONCERN OF HERS
5350-205003-0018 WHAT REPLIED GERTY WITH A SMILE REINFORCED BY THE WHITEST OF TEETH I WAS ONLY WONDERING WAS IT LATE BECAUSE SHE WISHED TO GOODNESS THEY'D TAKE THE SNOTTYNOSED TWINS AND THEIR BABBY HOME
5350-205003-0019 TO THE MISCHIEF OUT OF THAT SO THAT WAS WHY SHE JUST GAVE A GENTLE HINT ABOUT ITS BEING LATE AND WHEN CISSY CAME UP EDY ASKED HER THE TIME AND MISS CISSY AS GLIB AS YOU LIKE SAID IT WAS HALF PAST KISSING TIME TIME TO KISS AGAIN
5350-205003-0020 BUT EDY WANTED TO KNOW BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD TO BE IN EARLY WAIT SAID CISSY I'LL RUN ASK MY UNCLE PETER OVER THERE WHAT'S THE TIME BY HIS CONUNDRUM SO OVER SHE WENT AND WHEN HE SAW HER COMING
5350-205003-0021 SHE COULD SEE HIM TAKE HIS HAND OUT OF HIS POCKET GETTING NERVOUS AND BEGINNING TO PLAY WITH HIS WATCHCHAIN LOOKING UP AT THE CHURCH PASSIONATE NATURE THOUGH HE WAS GERTY COULD SEE THAT HE HAD ENORMOUS CONTROL OVER HIMSELF
5350-205003-0022 ONE MOMENT HE HAD BEEN THERE FASCINATED BY A LOVELINESS THAT MADE HIM GAZE
5350-205003-0023 SELFCONTROL EXPRESSED IN EVERY LINE OF HIS DISTINGUISHEDLOOKING FIGURE CISSY SAID TO EXCUSE HER WOULD HE MIND PLEASE TELLING HER WHAT WAS THE RIGHT TIME AND GERTY COULD SEE HIM TAKING OUT HIS WATCH LISTENING TO IT AND LOOKING UP AND CLEARING HIS THROAT
5350-205003-0024 AND HE SAID HE WAS VERY SORRY HIS WATCH WAS STOPPED BUT HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE AFTER EIGHT BECAUSE THE SUN WAS SET HIS VOICE HAD A CULTURED RING IN IT AND THOUGH HE SPOKE IN MEASURED ACCENTS THERE WAS A SUSPICION OF A QUIVER IN THE MELLOW TONES
5350-205003-0025 CISSY SAID THANKS AND CAME BACK WITH HER TONGUE OUT AND SAID UNCLE SAID HIS WATERWORKS WERE OUT OF ORDER THEN THEY SANG THE SECOND VERSE OF THE TANTUM ERGO AND CANON O'HANLON GOT UP AGAIN AND CENSED THE BLESSED SACRAMENT AND KNELT DOWN
5350-205003-0026 AND HE TOLD FATHER CONROY THAT ONE OF THE CANDLES WAS JUST GOING TO SET FIRE TO THE FLOWERS AND FATHER CONROY GOT UP AND SETTLED IT ALL RIGHT AND SHE COULD SEE THE GENTLEMAN WINDING HIS WATCH AND LISTENING TO THE WORKS AND SHE SWUNG HER LEG MORE IN AND OUT IN TIME
5350-205003-0027 IT WAS GETTING DARKER BUT HE COULD SEE AND HE WAS LOOKING ALL THE TIME THAT HE WAS WINDING THE WATCH OR WHATEVER HE WAS DOING TO IT AND THEN HE PUT IT BACK AND PUT HIS HANDS BACK INTO HIS POCKETS
5350-205003-0028 AND SHE KNEW BY THE FEEL OF HER SCALP AND THAT IRRITATION AGAINST HER STAYS THAT THAT THING MUST BE COMING ON BECAUSE THE LAST TIME TOO WAS WHEN SHE CLIPPED HER HAIR ON ACCOUNT OF THE MOON
5350-205003-0029 LITERALLY WORSHIPPING AT HER SHRINE IF EVER THERE WAS UNDISGUISED ADMIRATION IN A MAN'S PASSIONATE GAZE IT WAS THERE PLAIN TO BE SEEN ON THAT MAN'S FACE
5350-205003-0030 EDY BEGAN TO GET READY TO GO AND IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HER AND GERTY NOTICED THAT THAT LITTLE HINT SHE GAVE HAD HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT BECAUSE IT WAS A LONG WAY ALONG THE STRAND TO WHERE THERE WAS THE PLACE TO PUSH UP THE PUSHCAR
5350-205003-0031 AND CANON O'HANLON STOOD UP WITH HIS COPE POKING UP AT HIS NECK AND FATHER CONROY HANDED HIM THE CARD TO READ OFF AND HE READ OUT
5350-205003-0032 EIS AND EDY AND CISSY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TIME ALL THE TIME AND ASKING HER BUT GERTY COULD PAY THEM BACK IN THEIR OWN COIN AND SHE JUST ANSWERED WITH SCATHING POLITENESS WHEN EDY ASKED HER WAS SHE HEARTBROKEN ABOUT HER BEST BOY THROWING HER OVER
5350-205003-0033 GERTY WINCED SHARPLY A BRIEF COLD BLAZE SHONE FROM HER EYES THAT SPOKE VOLUMES OF SCORN IMMEASURABLE IT HURT O YES
5350-205003-0034 IT CUT DEEP BECAUSE EDY HAD HER OWN QUIET WAY OF SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT SHE KNEW WOULD WOUND LIKE THE CONFOUNDED LITTLE CAT SHE WAS GERTY'S LIPS PARTED SWIFTLY TO FRAME THE WORD
5350-205003-0035 BUT SHE FOUGHT BACK THE SOB THAT ROSE TO HER THROAT SO SLIM SO FLAWLESS
5350-205003-0036 SHE HAD LOVED HIM BETTER THAN HE KNEW LIGHTHEARTED DECEIVER AND FICKLE LIKE ALL HIS SEX HE WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT HE HAD MEANT TO HER AND FOR AN INSTANT THERE WAS IN THE BLUE EYES A QUICK STINGING OF TEARS
5350-205003-0037 THEIR EYES WERE PROBING HER MERCILESSLY BUT WITH A BRAVE EFFORT SHE SPARKLED BACK IN SYMPATHY AS SHE GLANCED AT HER NEW CONQUEST FOR THEM TO SEE O RESPONDED GERTY QUICK AS LIGHTNING LAUGHING
5350-205003-0038 AND THE PROUD HEAD FLASHED UP I CAN THROW MY CAP AT WHO I LIKE BECAUSE IT'S LEAP YEAR
5350-205003-0039 BUT THEY CUT THE SILENCE ICILY THERE WAS THAT IN HER YOUNG VOICE THAT TOLD THAT SHE WAS NOT A ONE TO BE LIGHTLY TRIFLED WITH
5350-205003-0040 SHE COULD JUST CHUCK HIM ASIDE AS IF HE WAS SO MUCH FILTH AND NEVER AGAIN WOULD SHE CAST AS MUCH AS A SECOND THOUGHT ON HIM AND TEAR HIS SILLY POSTCARD INTO A DOZEN PIECES
5350-205003-0041 AND IF EVER AFTER HE DARED TO PRESUME SHE COULD GIVE HIM ONE LOOK OF MEASURED SCORN THAT WOULD MAKE HIM SHRIVEL UP ON THE SPOT MISS PUNY LITTLE EDY'S COUNTENANCE FELL TO NO SLIGHT EXTENT
5350-205003-0042 AND GERTY COULD SEE BY HER LOOKING AS BLACK AS THUNDER THAT SHE WAS SIMPLY IN A TOWERING RAGE THOUGH SHE HID IT THE LITTLE KINNATT BECAUSE THAT SHAFT HAD STRUCK HOME FOR HER PETTY JEALOUSY AND THEY BOTH KNEW THAT SHE WAS SOMETHING ALOOF APART
5350-205003-0043 IN ANOTHER SPHERE THAT SHE WAS NOT OF THEM AND NEVER WOULD BE AND THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE TOO THAT KNEW IT AND SAW IT SO THEY COULD PUT THAT IN THEIR PIPE AND SMOKE IT EDY STRAIGHTENED UP BABY BOARDMAN TO GET READY TO GO
5350-205003-0044 AND CISSY TUCKED IN THE BALL AND THE SPADES AND BUCKETS AND IT WAS HIGH TIME TOO BECAUSE THE SANDMAN WAS ON HIS WAY FOR MASTER BOARDMAN JUNIOR AND CISSY TOLD HIM TOO THAT BILLY WINKS WAS COMING AND THAT BABY WAS TO GO DEEDAW
5350-205003-0045 AND BABY LOOKED JUST TOO DUCKY LAUGHING UP OUT OF HIS GLEEFUL EYES AND CISSY POKED HIM LIKE THAT OUT OF FUN IN HIS WEE FAT TUMMY
5350-205003-0046 SENT UP HIS COMPLIMENTS TO ALL AND SUNDRY ON TO HIS BRANDNEW DRIBBLING BIB
5350-205003-0047 HE HAS HIS BIB DESTROYED THE SLIGHT CONTRETEMPS CLAIMED HER ATTENTION BUT IN TWO TWOS SHE SET THAT LITTLE MATTER TO RIGHTS GERTY STIFLED A SMOTHERED EXCLAMATION AND GAVE A NERVOUS COUGH AND EDY ASKED WHAT
5350-205003-0048 AND SHE WAS JUST GOING TO TELL HER TO CATCH IT WHILE IT WAS FLYING BUT SHE WAS EVER LADYLIKE IN HER DEPORTMENT SO SHE SIMPLY PASSED IT OFF WITH CONSUMMATE TACT BY SAYING THAT THAT WAS THE BENEDICTION
5350-205003-0049 BECAUSE JUST THEN THE BELL RANG OUT FROM THE STEEPLE OVER THE QUIET SEASHORE BECAUSE CANON O'HANLON WAS UP ON THE ALTAR WITH THE VEIL THAT FATHER CONROY PUT ROUND HIS SHOULDERS GIVING THE BENEDICTION WITH THE BLESSED SACRAMENT IN HIS HANDS
5350-205003-0050 HOW MOVING THE SCENE THERE IN THE GATHERING TWILIGHT THE LAST GLIMPSE OF ERIN THE TOUCHING CHIME OF THOSE EVENING BELLS AND AT THE SAME TIME A BAT FLEW FORTH FROM THE IVIED BELFRY
5350-205003-0051 THROUGH THE DUSK HITHER THITHER WITH A TINY LOST CRY AND SHE COULD SEE FAR AWAY THE LIGHTS OF THE LIGHTHOUSES SO PICTURESQUE SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO DO WITH A BOX OF PAINTS BECAUSE IT WAS EASIER THAN TO MAKE A MAN
5350-205003-0052 AND SOON THE LAMPLIGHTER WOULD BE GOING HIS ROUNDS PAST THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH GROUNDS AND ALONG BY SHADY TRITONVILLE AVENUE WHERE THE COUPLES WALKED AND LIGHTING THE LAMP NEAR HER WINDOW
5350-205003-0053 WHERE REGGY WYLIE USED TO TURN HIS FREEWHEEL LIKE SHE READ IN THAT BOOK THE LAMPLIGHTER BY MISS CUMMINS AUTHOR OF MABEL VAUGHAN AND OTHER TALES FOR GERTY HAD HER DREAMS THAT NO ONE KNEW OF SHE LOVED TO READ POETRY
5350-205003-0054 AND WHEN SHE GOT A KEEPSAKE FROM BERTHA SUPPLE OF THAT LOVELY CONFESSION ALBUM WITH THE CORALPINK COVER TO WRITE HER THOUGHTS IN SHE LAID IT IN THE DRAWER OF HER TOILETTABLE WHICH THOUGH IT DID NOT ERR ON THE SIDE OF LUXURY
5350-205003-0055 WAS SCRUPULOUSLY NEAT AND CLEAN IT WAS THERE SHE KEPT HER GIRLISH TREASURE TROVE THE TORTOISESHELL COMBS HER CHILD OF MARY BADGE
5350-205003-0056 THE EYEBROWLEINE HER ALABASTER POUNCETBOX AND THE RIBBONS TO CHANGE WHEN HER THINGS CAME HOME FROM THE WASH AND THERE WERE SOME BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS WRITTEN IN IT IN VIOLET INK THAT SHE BOUGHT IN HELY'S OF DAME STREET
