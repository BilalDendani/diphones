4806-26895-0000 AT FIRST GLANCE THE SCENE IRRITATED ME NEVER AT ANY TIME HAVE I BEEN ABLE TO BEAR THE FLUNKEYISHNESS WHICH ONE MEETS IN THE PRESS OF THE WORLD AT LARGE BUT MORE ESPECIALLY IN THAT OF RUSSIA WHERE ALMOST EVERY EVENING JOURNALISTS WRITE ON TWO SUBJECTS IN PARTICULAR
4806-26895-0001 AND ON THE HEAPS OF GOLD WHICH ARE DAILY TO BE SEEN LYING ON THEIR TABLES THOSE JOURNALISTS ARE NOT PAID FOR DOING SO THEY WRITE THUS MERELY OUT OF A SPIRIT OF DISINTERESTED COMPLAISANCE FOR THERE IS NOTHING SPLENDID ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENTS IN QUESTION
4806-26895-0002 OF COURSE DURING THE SEASON SOME MADMAN OR ANOTHER MAY MAKE HIS APPEARANCE GENERALLY AN ENGLISHMAN OR AN ASIATIC OR A TURK AND AS HAD HAPPENED DURING THE SUMMER OF WHICH I WRITE WIN OR LOSE A GREAT DEAL
4806-26895-0003 IT PLAYS ONLY FOR PETTY GULDEN AND SELDOM DOES MUCH WEALTH FIGURE ON THE BOARD WHEN ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ENTERED THE GAMING ROOMS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
4806-26895-0004 FOR ONE THING THE CROWD OPPRESSED ME HAD I BEEN PLAYING FOR MYSELF I THINK I SHOULD HAVE LEFT AT ONCE AND NEVER HAVE EMBARKED UPON GAMBLING AT ALL FOR I COULD FEEL MY HEART BEGINNING TO BEAT AND MY HEART WAS ANYTHING BUT COLD BLOODED ALSO I KNEW I HAD LONG AGO MADE UP MY MIND THAT NEVER SHOULD I DEPART FROM ROULETTENBERG
4806-26895-0005 THUS IT MUST AND WOULD BE HOWEVER RIDICULOUS IT MAY SEEM TO YOU THAT I WAS EXPECTING TO WIN AT ROULETTE I LOOK UPON THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED OPINION CONCERNING THE FOLLY AND THE GROSSNESS OF HOPING TO WIN AT GAMBLING AS A THING EVEN MORE ABSURD
4806-26895-0006 FOR WHY IS GAMBLING A WHIT WORSE THAN ANY OTHER METHOD OF ACQUIRING MONEY HOW FOR INSTANCE IS IT WORSE THAN TRADE TRUE OUT OF A HUNDRED PERSONS ONLY ONE CAN WIN YET WHAT BUSINESS IS THAT OF YOURS OR OF MINE
4806-26895-0007 AND DECIDED TO ATTEMPT NOTHING SERIOUS
4806-26895-0008 I SHOULD DO IT IN AN ABSENT MINDED HAPHAZARD SORT OF WAY OF THAT I FELT CERTAIN ALSO IT BEHOVED ME TO LEARN THE GAME ITSELF
4806-26895-0009 IN THE FIRST PLACE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO ME SO FOUL SO MORALLY MEAN AND FOUL YET I AM NOT SPEAKING OF THE HUNGRY RESTLESS FOLK WHO BY SCORES NAY EVEN BY HUNDREDS COULD BE SEEN CROWDED AROUND THE GAMING TABLES
4806-26895-0010 I HAVE ALWAYS APPLAUDED THE OPINION OF A CERTAIN DEAD AND GONE BUT COCKSURE MORALIST WHO REPLIED TO THE EXCUSE THAT ONE MAY ALWAYS GAMBLE MODERATELY BY SAYING THAT TO DO SO MAKES THINGS WORSE SINCE IN THAT CASE THE PROFITS TOO WILL ALWAYS BE MODERATE
4806-26895-0011 INSIGNIFICANT PROFITS AND SUMPTUOUS PROFITS DO NOT STAND ON THE SAME FOOTING NO IT IS ALL A MATTER OF PROPORTION
4806-26895-0012 CAN BE FOUND DEPRIVING THEIR FELLOWS OF SOMETHING JUST AS THEY DO AT ROULETTE AS TO THE QUESTION WHETHER STAKES AND WINNINGS ARE IN THEMSELVES IMMORAL IS ANOTHER QUESTION ALTOGETHER AND I WISH TO EXPRESS NO OPINION UPON
4806-26895-0013 IN SPITE OF ITS ATTENDANT SQUALOR TO CONTAIN IF YOU WILL SOMETHING INTIMATE SOMETHING SYMPATHETIC TO MY EYES FOR IT IS ALWAYS PLEASANT TO SEE MEN DISPENSING WITH CEREMONY
4806-26895-0014 YET WHY SHOULD I SO DECEIVE MYSELF I COULD SEE THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS A VAIN AND UNREASONING PURSUIT AND WHAT AT THE FIRST GLANCE SEEMED TO ME THE UGLIEST FEATURE IN THIS MOB OF ROULETTE PLAYERS
4806-26895-0015 THE SERIOUSNESS AND EVEN THE HUMILITY WITH WHICH THEY STOOD AROUND THE GAMING TABLES MOREOVER I HAD ALWAYS DRAWN SHARP DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN A GAME WHICH IS
4806-26895-0016 HEREIN AS SAID I DRAW SHARP DISTINCTIONS YET HOW ESSENTIALLY BASE ARE THE DISTINCTIONS FOR INSTANCE A GENTLEMAN MAY STAKE SAY FIVE OR TEN
4806-26895-0017 WHEN HE MAY STAKE SAY A THOUSAND FRANCS
4806-26895-0018 OR TO STAKE AGAIN OR TO DOUBLE HIS STAKE BUT EVEN THIS HE MUST DO SOLELY OUT OF CURIOSITY AND FOR THE PLEASURE OF WATCHING THE PLAY OF CHANCES AND OF CALCULATIONS AND NOT BECAUSE OF ANY VULGAR DESIRE TO WIN
4806-26895-0019 BEST OF ALL HE OUGHT TO IMAGINE HIS FELLOW GAMBLERS AND THE REST OF THE MOB WHICH STANDS TREMBLING OVER A COIN TO BE EQUALLY RICH AND GENTLEMANLY WITH HIMSELF
4806-26895-0020 ELEGANT DAUGHTERS MISSES OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN AS TO GIVE THEM A FEW GOLD COINS AND TEACH THEM HOW TO PLAY
4806-26895-0021 BUT THE GENERAL DID NOT EVEN NOTICE HIM SLOWLY HE TOOK OUT HIS MONEY BAGS AND SLOWLY EXTRACTED THREE HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD WHICH HE STAKED ON THE BLACK AND WON YET HE DID NOT TAKE UP HIS WINNINGS HE LEFT THEM THERE ON THE TABLE AGAIN THE BLACK TURNED UP AND AGAIN HE DID NOT GATHER IN WHAT HE HAD WON
4806-26895-0022 AND WHEN IN THE THIRD ROUND THE RED TURNED UP HE LOST
4806-26895-0023 YET EVEN THEN HE ROSE WITH A SMILE AND THUS PRESERVED HIS REPUTATION YET I KNEW THAT HIS MONEY BAGS MUST BE CHAFING HIS HEART AS WELL AS THAT
4806-26895-0024 HE WOULD STILL HAVE RESTRAINED HIMSELF FROM VENTING HIS DISAPPOINTMENT ON THE OTHER HAND I SAW A FRENCHMAN FIRST WIN AND THEN LOSE THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS CHEERFULLY AND WITHOUT A MURMUR YES EVEN IF A GENTLEMAN SHOULD LOSE HIS WHOLE SUBSTANCE HE MUST NEVER GIVE WAY TO ANNOYANCE
4806-26895-0025 AS NEVER TO BE WORTH A THOUGHT OF COURSE THE SUPREMELY ARISTOCRATIC THING IS TO BE ENTIRELY OBLIVIOUS OF THE MIRE OF RABBLE WITH ITS SETTING
4806-26895-0026 AND EVEN TO GAPE AT THE MOB FOR PREFERENCE THROUGH A LORGNETTE
4806-26895-0027 WHICH HAD BEEN ORGANISED SPECIALLY FOR A GENTLEMAN'S DIVERSION THOUGH ONE MAY BE SQUEEZED BY THE CROWD ONE MUST LOOK AS THOUGH ONE WERE FULLY ASSURED OF BEING THE OBSERVER OF HAVING NEITHER PART NOR LOT WITH THE OBSERVED AT THE SAME TIME
4806-26895-0028 TO STARE FIXEDLY ABOUT ONE IS UNBECOMING FOR THAT AGAIN IS UNGENTLEMANLY SEEING THAT
4806-26895-0029 HOWEVER TO ME PERSONALLY THE SCENE DID SEEM TO BE WORTH UNDISGUISED CONTEMPLATION MORE ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT I HAD COME THERE NOT ONLY TO LOOK AT BUT ALSO TO NUMBER MYSELF SINCERELY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH THE MOB AS FOR MY SECRET MORAL VIEWS
4806-26895-0030 I HAD NO ROOM FOR THEM AMONGST MY ACTUAL PRACTICAL OPINIONS LET THAT STAND AS WRITTEN I AM WRITING ONLY TO RELIEVE MY CONSCIENCE
4806-26895-0031 AND THOUGHTS BY A MORAL STANDARD ANOTHER STANDARD ALTOGETHER HAS DIRECTED MY LIFE AS A MATTER OF FACT THE MOB WAS PLAYING IN EXCEEDINGLY FOUL FASHION
4806-26895-0032 AS FOR THE CROWD ITSELF WELL IT CONSISTED MOSTLY OF FRENCHMEN YET I WAS NOT THEN TAKING NOTES MERELY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU A DESCRIPTION OF ROULETTE
4806-26895-0033 AT FIRST THE PROCEEDINGS WERE PURE GREEK TO ME I COULD ONLY DIVINE AND DISTINGUISH THAT STAKES WERE HAZARDED
4806-26895-0034 THE THOUGHT THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO PLAY FOR MYSELF QUITE UNNERVED ME IT WAS AN UNPLEASANT SENSATION AND I TRIED HARD TO BANISH IT I HAD A FEELING THAT
4806-26895-0035 I SHOULD WRECK MY OWN FORTUNES ALSO I WONDER IF ANY ONE HAS EVER APPROACHED A GAMING TABLE WITHOUT FALLING AN IMMEDIATE PREY TO SUPERSTITION I BEGAN BY PULLING OUT FIFTY GULDEN AND STAKING THEM ON EVEN THE WHEEL SPUN AND STOPPED AT THIRTEEN I HAD LOST
4806-26895-0036 WITH A FEELING LIKE A SICK QUALM AS THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE MY WAY OUT OF THE CROWD AND GO HOME I STAKED ANOTHER FIFTY GULDEN
4806-26895-0037 AND AGAIN THE RED TURNED UP AGAIN I STAKED THE WHOLE SUM AND AGAIN THE RED TURNED UP CLUTCHING MY FOUR HUNDRED GULDEN I PLACED TWO HUNDRED OF THEM ON TWELVE FIGURES TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME OF IT
4806-26895-0038 THUS FROM ONE HUNDRED GULDEN MY STORE HAD GROWN TO EIGHT HUNDRED
4806-26895-0039 ALWAYS THE THOUGHT KEPT RECURRING TO ME THAT IF I HAD BEEN PLAYING FOR MYSELF ALONE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD SUCH LUCK ONCE MORE I STAKED THE WHOLE EIGHT HUNDRED GULDEN ON THE EVEN THE WHEEL STOPPED AT FOUR I WAS PAID OUT ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED GULDEN AND SNATCHING UP MY PILE OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED DEPARTED IN SEARCH OF POLINA ALEXANDROVNA
4806-26895-0040 THIS TIME THE FRENCHMAN WAS ABSENT FROM THE MEAL AND THE GENERAL SEEMED TO BE IN A MORE EXPANSIVE VEIN AMONG OTHER THINGS HE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO REMIND ME THAT HE WOULD BE SORRY TO SEE ME PLAYING AT THE GAMING TABLES IN HIS OPINION SUCH CONDUCT WOULD GREATLY COMPROMISE HIM ESPECIALLY IF I WERE TO LOSE MUCH
4806-26895-0041 SORT OF WAY OF COURSE I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ORDER YOUR ACTIONS BUT YOU YOURSELF WILL AGREE THAT AS USUAL HE DID NOT FINISH HIS SENTENCE
4806-26895-0042 WHY NOT SHE ASKED EXCITEDLY BECAUSE I WISH TO PLAY FOR MYSELF I REPLIED WITH A FEIGNED GLANCE OF ASTONISHMENT THAT IS MY SOLE REASON
4806-26895-0043 I SAID VERY SERIOUSLY YES AND THEN ADDED POSSIBLY MY CERTAINTY ABOUT WINNING MAY SEEM TO YOU RIDICULOUS YET PRAY LEAVE ME IN PEACE
4806-26895-0044 AND OFFERED ME EIGHT HUNDRED GULDEN ON CONDITION THAT HENCEFORTH I GAMBLED ONLY ON THOSE TERMS
4806-26895-0045 STATING AS MY REASON THAT I FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO PLAY ON BEHALF OF ANY ONE ELSE
4806-26895-0046 BUT IN ALL PROBABILITY I SHOULD LOSE
