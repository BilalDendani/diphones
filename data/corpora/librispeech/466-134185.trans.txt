466-134185-0000 MANY A MAN CURSES THE RAIN THAT FALLS UPON HIS HEAD AND KNOWS NOT THAT IT BRINGS ABUNDANCE TO DRIVE AWAY HUNGER AS IS SEEN IN THE PERSON OF A YOUNG MAN OF WHOM I WILL TELL YOU IT IS SAID THAT THERE WAS ONCE A VERY RICH MERCHANT NAMED ANTONIELLO
466-134185-0001 WHO HAD A SON CALLED CIENZO IT HAPPENED THAT CIENZO WAS ONE DAY THROWING STONES ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE SON OF THE KING OF NAPLES AND BY CHANCE BROKE HIS COMPANION'S HEAD WHEN HE TOLD HIS FATHER
466-134185-0002 ANTONIELLO FLEW INTO A RAGE WITH FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND ABUSED HIS SON BUT CIENZO ANSWERED SIR I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD SAY THAT BETTER IS THE LAW COURT THAN THE DOCTOR IN ONE'S HOUSE WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD BROKEN MY HEAD
466-134185-0003 IT WAS HE WHO BEGAN AND PROVOKED ME WE ARE BUT BOYS AND THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUARREL AFTER ALL TIS A FIRST FAULT AND THE KING IS A MAN OF REASON BUT LET THE WORST COME TO THE WORST WHAT GREAT HARM CAN HE DO ME THE WIDE WORLD IS ONE'S HOME
466-134185-0004 AND LET HIM WHO IS AFRAID TURN CONSTABLE BUT ANTONIELLO WOULD NOT LISTEN TO REASON HE MADE SURE THE KING WOULD KILL CIENZO FOR HIS FAULT AND SAID DON'T STAND HERE AT RISK OF YOUR LIFE BUT MARCH OFF THIS VERY INSTANT
466-134185-0005 SO THAT NOBODY MAY HEAR A WORD NEW OR OLD OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE A BIRD IN THE BUSH IS BETTER THAN A BIRD IN THE CAGE HERE IS MONEY TAKE ONE OF THE TWO ENCHANTED HORSES I HAVE IN THE STABLE AND THE DOG WHICH IS ALSO ENCHANTED AND TARRY NO LONGER HERE
466-134185-0006 IT IS BETTER TO SCAMPER OFF AND USE YOUR OWN HEELS THAN TO BE TOUCHED BY ANOTHER'S BETTER TO THROW YOUR LEGS OVER YOUR BACK THAN TO CARRY YOUR HEAD BETWEEN TWO LEGS IF YOU DON'T TAKE YOUR KNAPSACK AND BE OFF NONE OF THE SAINTS CAN HELP YOU
466-134185-0007 THEN BEGGING HIS FATHER'S BLESSING CIENZO MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND TUCKING THE ENCHANTED DOG UNDER HIS ARM HE WENT HIS WAY OUT OF THE CITY MAKING A WINTER OF TEARS WITH A SUMMER OF SIGHS
466-134185-0008 HE WENT HIS WAY UNTIL THE EVENING WHEN HE CAME TO A WOOD THAT KEPT THE MULE OF THE SUN OUTSIDE ITS LIMITS WHILE IT WAS AMUSING ITSELF WITH SILENCE AND THE SHADES AN OLD HOUSE STOOD THERE AT THE FOOT OF A TOWER
466-134185-0009 BUT THE MASTER BEING IN FEAR OF ROBBERS WOULD NOT OPEN TO HIM SO THE POOR YOUTH WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN IN THE RUINED OLD HOUSE HE TURNED HIS HORSE OUT TO GRAZE IN A MEADOW AND THREW HIMSELF ON SOME STRAW HE FOUND WITH THE DOG BY HIS SIDE
466-134185-0010 BUT SCARCELY HAD HE CLOSED HIS EYES WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY THE BARKING OF THE DOG AND HEARD FOOTSTEPS STIRRING IN THE HOUSE CIENZO WHO WAS BOLD AND VENTURESOME SEIZED HIS SWORD AND BEGAN TO LAY ABOUT HIM IN THE DARK
466-134185-0011 BUT PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS ONLY STRIKING THE WIND AND HIT NO ONE HE TURNED ROUND AGAIN TO SLEEP AFTER A FEW MINUTES HE FELT HIMSELF PULLED GENTLY BY THE FOOT HE TURNED TO LAY HOLD AGAIN OF HIS CUTLASS
466-134185-0012 AND JUMPING UP EXCLAIMED HOLLO THERE YOU ARE GETTING TOO TROUBLESOME BUT LEAVE OFF THIS SPORT AND LET'S HAVE A BOUT OF IT IF YOU HAVE ANY PLUCK FOR YOU HAVE FOUND THE LAST TO YOUR SHOE AT THESE WORDS HE HEARD A SHOUT OF LAUGHTER AND THEN A HOLLOW VOICE SAYING
466-134185-0013 COME DOWN HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU WHO I AM THEN CIENZO WITHOUT LOSING COURAGE ANSWERED WAIT AWHILE I'LL COME SO HE GROPED ABOUT UNTIL AT LAST HE FOUND A LADDER WHICH LED TO A CELLAR
466-134185-0014 AND GOING DOWN HE SAW A LIGHTED LAMP AND THREE GHOST LOOKING FIGURES WHO WERE MAKING A PITEOUS CLAMOUR CRYING ALAS MY BEAUTEOUS TREASURE I MUST LOSE THEE WHEN CIENZO SAW THIS
466-134185-0015 HE BEGAN HIMSELF TO CRY AND LAMENT FOR COMPANY'S SAKE AND AFTER HE HAD WEPT FOR SOME TIME THE MOON HAVING NOW WITH THE AXE OF HER RAYS BROKEN THE BAR OF THE SKY THE THREE FIGURES WHO WERE MAKING THE OUTCRY SAID TO CIENZO
466-134185-0016 TAKE THIS TREASURE WHICH IS DESTINED FOR THEE ALONE BUT MIND AND TAKE CARE OF IT THEN THEY VANISHED AND CIENZO
466-134185-0017 WISHED TO CLIMB UP AGAIN BUT COULD NOT FIND THE LADDER WHEREAT HE SET UP SUCH A CRY
466-134185-0018 WHEN THEY DISCOVERED A GREAT TREASURE HE WISHED TO GIVE PART OF IT TO CIENZO BUT THE LATTER REFUSED AND TAKING HIS DOG AND MOUNTING ONCE MORE ON HIS HORSE SET OUT AGAIN ON HIS TRAVELS
466-134185-0019 AFTER A WHILE HE ARRIVED AT A WILD AND DREARY FOREST SO DARK THAT IT MADE YOU SHUDDER THERE UPON THE BANK OF A RIVER HE FOUND A FAIRY SURROUNDED BY A BAND OF ROBBERS CIENZO SEEING THE WICKED INTENTION OF THE ROBBERS
466-134185-0020 SEIZED HIS SWORD AND SOON MADE A SLAUGHTER OF THEM THE FAIRY SHOWERED THANKS UPON HIM FOR THIS BRAVE DEED DONE FOR HER SAKE AND INVITED HIM TO HER PALACE THAT SHE MIGHT REWARD HIM BUT CIENZO REPLIED IT IS NOTHING AT ALL THANK YOU KINDLY
466-134185-0021 ANOTHER TIME I WILL ACCEPT THE FAVOUR BUT NOW I AM IN HASTE ON BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE SO SAYING HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
466-134185-0022 HE CAME AT LAST TO THE PALACE OF A KING WHICH WAS ALL HUNG WITH MOURNING SO THAT IT MADE ONE'S HEART BLACK TO LOOK AT IT WHEN CIENZO INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF THE MOURNING THE FOLKS ANSWERED A DRAGON WITH SEVEN HEADS HAS MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THIS COUNTRY
466-134185-0023 THE MOST TERRIBLE MONSTER THAT EVER WAS SEEN WITH THE CREST OF A COCK THE HEAD OF A CAT EYES OF FIRE THE MOUTH OF A BULLDOG THE WINGS OF A BAT THE CLAWS OF A BEAR AND THE TAIL OF A SERPENT NOW THIS DRAGON SWALLOWS A MAIDEN EVERY DAY
466-134185-0024 AND NOW THE LOT HAS FALLEN ON MENECHELLA THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING SO THERE IS GREAT WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE ROYAL PALACE SINCE THE FAIREST CREATURE IN ALL THE LAND IS DOOMED TO BE DEVOURED BY THIS HORRID BEAST
466-134185-0025 AND BEWAILING THE SAD FATE OF THE POOR GIRL THEN THE DRAGON CAME OUT OF THE CAVE BUT CIENZO LAID HOLD OF HIS SWORD AND STRUCK OFF A HEAD IN A TRICE BUT THE DRAGON WENT AND RUBBED HIS NECK ON A CERTAIN PLANT WHICH GREW NOT FAR OFF
466-134185-0026 AND SUDDENLY THE HEAD JOINED ITSELF ON AGAIN LIKE A LIZARD JOINING ITSELF TO ITS TAIL CIENZO SEEING THIS EXCLAIMED HE WHO DARES NOT WINS NOT AND SETTING HIS TEETH HE STRUCK SUCH A FURIOUS BLOW
466-134185-0027 THAT HE CUT OFF ALL SEVEN HEADS WHICH FLEW FROM THE NECKS LIKE PEAS FROM THE PAN WHEREUPON HE TOOK OUT THE TONGUES AND PUTTING THEM IN HIS POCKET HE FLUNG THE HEADS A MILE APART FROM THE BODY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NEVER COME TOGETHER AGAIN
466-134185-0028 THAT WHOSOEVER HAD KILLED THE DRAGON SHOULD COME AND MARRY THE PRINCESS NOW A RASCAL OF A COUNTRY FELLOW HEARING THIS PROCLAMATION TOOK THE HEADS OF THE DRAGON AND SAID MENECHELLA HAS BEEN SAVED BY ME THESE HANDS HAVE FREED THE LAND FROM DESTRUCTION
466-134185-0029 BEHOLD THE DRAGON'S HEADS WHICH ARE THE PROOFS OF MY VALOUR THEREFORE RECOLLECT EVERY PROMISE IS A DEBT AS SOON AS THE KING HEARD THIS HE LIFTED THE CROWN FROM HIS OWN HEAD AND SET IT UPON THE COUNTRYMAN'S POLL WHO LOOKED LIKE A THIEF ON THE GALLOWS
466-134185-0030 THE NEWS OF THIS PROCLAMATION FLEW THROUGH THE WHOLE COUNTRY TILL AT LAST IT CAME TO THE EARS OF CIENZO WHO SAID TO HIMSELF VERILY I AM A GREAT BLOCKHEAD I HAD HOLD OF FORTUNE BY THE FORELOCK AND I LET HER ESCAPE OUT OF MY HAND
466-134185-0031 HERE'S A MAN OFFERS TO GIVE ME THE HALF OF A TREASURE HE FINDS AND I CARE NO MORE FOR IT THAN A GERMAN FOR COLD WATER THE FAIRY WISHES TO ENTERTAIN ME IN HER PALACE AND I CARE AS LITTLE FOR IT AS AN ASS FOR MUSIC AND NOW THAT I AM CALLED TO THE CROWN
466-134185-0032 HERE I STAND AND LET A RASCALLY THIEF CHEAT ME OUT OF MY TRUMP CARD SO SAYING HE TOOK AN INKSTAND SEIZED A PEN AND SPREADING OUT A SHEET OF PAPER BEGAN TO WRITE TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JEWEL OF WOMEN MENECHELLA
466-134185-0033 HAVING BY THE FAVOUR OF SOL IN LEO SAVED THY LIFE I HEAR THAT ANOTHER PLUMES HIMSELF WITH MY LABOURS THAT ANOTHER CLAIMS THE REWARD OF THE SERVICE WHICH I RENDERED THOU THEREFORE WHO WAST PRESENT AT THE DRAGON'S DEATH
466-134185-0034 CANST ASSURE THE KING OF THE TRUTH AND PREVENT HIS ALLOWING ANOTHER TO GAIN THIS REWARD WHILE I HAVE HAD ALL THE TOIL FOR IT WILL BE THE RIGHT EFFECT OF THY FAIR ROYAL GRACE AND THE MERITED RECOMPENSE OF THIS STRONG HERO'S FIST IN CONCLUSION
466-134185-0035 I KISS THY DELICATE LITTLE HANDS FROM THE INN OF THE FLOWER POT SUNDAY HAVING WRITTEN THIS LETTER AND SEALED IT WITH A WAFER HE PLACED IT IN THE MOUTH OF THE ENCHANTED DOG SAYING
466-134185-0036 AND TAKE THIS TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER GIVE IT TO NO ONE ELSE BUT PLACE IT IN THE HAND OF THAT SILVER FACED MAIDEN HERSELF AWAY RAN THE DOG TO THE PALACE AS IF HE WERE FLYING AND GOING UP THE STAIRS HE FOUND THE KING
466-134185-0037 WHO WAS STILL PAYING COMPLIMENTS TO THE COUNTRY CLOWN WHEN THE MAN SAW THE DOG WITH THE LETTER IN HIS MOUTH HE ORDERED IT TO BE TAKEN FROM HIM BUT THE DOG WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO ANY ONE AND BOUNDING UP TO MENECHELLA HE PLACED IT IN HER HAND
466-134185-0038 THEN MENECHELLA ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND MAKING A CURTSEY TO THE KING SHE GAVE HIM THE LETTER TO READ AND WHEN THE KING HAD READ IT HE ORDERED THAT THE DOG SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO SEE WHERE HE WENT AND THAT HIS MASTER SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM
466-134185-0039 SO TWO OF THE COURTIERS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE DOG UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE TAVERN WHERE THEY FOUND CIENZO AND DELIVERING THE MESSAGE FROM THE KING THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO THE PALACE INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
466-134185-0040 THEN THE KING DEMANDED HOW IT WAS THAT HE BOASTED OF HAVING KILLED THE DRAGON SINCE THE HEADS WERE BROUGHT BY THE MAN WHO WAS SITTING CROWNED AT HIS SIDE AND CIENZO ANSWERED THAT FELLOW DESERVES A PASTEBOARD MITRE RATHER THAN A CROWN
466-134185-0041 SINCE HE HAS HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO TELL YOU A BOUNCING LIE BUT TO PROVE TO YOU THAT I HAVE DONE THE DEED AND NOT THIS RASCAL ORDER THE HEADS TO BE PRODUCED NONE OF THEM CAN SPEAK TO THE PROOF WITHOUT A TONGUE AND THESE I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME AS WITNESSES TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE TRUTH
466-134185-0042 SO SAYING HE PULLED THE TONGUES OUT OF HIS POCKET WHILE THE COUNTRYMAN WAS STRUCK ALL OF A HEAP NOT KNOWING WHAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT AND THE MORE SO WHEN MENECHELLA ADDED THIS IS THE MAN AH YOU DOG OF A COUNTRYMAN A PRETTY TRICK YOU HAVE PLAYED ME
466-134185-0043 WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS HE TOOK THE CROWN FROM THE HEAD OF THAT FALSE LOON
