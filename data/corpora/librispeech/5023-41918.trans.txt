5023-41918-0000 THE LITTLE GRAY MAN A NUN A COUNTRYMAN AND A BLACKSMITH WERE ONCE WANDERING THROUGH THE WORLD TOGETHER ONE DAY THEY LOST THEIR WAY IN A THICK DARK FOREST AND WERE THANKFUL WHEN THEY SAW IN THE DISTANCE
5023-41918-0001 THE WALLS OF A HOUSE WHERE THEY HOPED THEY MIGHT OBTAIN REFUGE FOR THE NIGHT WHEN THEY GOT CLOSE TO THE HOUSE THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS AN OLD DESERTED CASTLE FAST FALLING INTO RUINS BUT WITH SOME OF THE ROOMS IN IT STILL HABITABLE
5023-41918-0002 AS THEY WERE HOMELESS THEY DETERMINED TO TAKE UP THEIR ABODE IN THE CASTLE AND THEY ARRANGED THAT ONE OF THEM SHOULD ALWAYS STAY AT HOME AND KEEP HOUSE
5023-41918-0003 THE LOT OF REMAINING AT HOME FELL FIRST TO THE NUN AND WHEN THE COUNTRYMAN AND THE BLACKSMITH HAD GONE OUT INTO THE WOOD SHE SET TO WORK TIDIED UP THE HOUSE AND PREPARED ALL THE FOOD FOR THE DAY
5023-41918-0004 AS HER COMPANIONS DID NOT COME HOME FOR THEIR MID DAY MEAL SHE ATE UP HER OWN PORTION AND PUT THE REST IN THE OVEN TO KEEP WARM JUST AS SHE WAS SITTING DOWN TO SEW THE DOOR OPENED
5023-41918-0005 AND A LITTLE GRAY MAN CAME IN AND STANDING BEFORE HER SAID OH HOW COLD I AM THE NUN WAS VERY SORRY FOR HIM AND SAID AT ONCE SIT DOWN BY THE FIRE AND WARM YOURSELF THE LITTLE MAN DID AS HE WAS TOLD
5023-41918-0006 AND SOON CALLED OUT OH HOW HUNGRY I AM THE NUN ANSWERED THERE IS FOOD IN THE OVEN HELP YOURSELF THE LITTLE MAN DID NOT NEED TO BE TOLD TWICE
5023-41918-0007 FOR HE SET TO WORK AND ATE UP EVERYTHING WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DESPATCH WHEN THE NUN SAW THIS SHE WAS VERY ANGRY AND SCOLDED THE DWARF BECAUSE HE HAD LEFT NOTHING FOR HER COMPANIONS
5023-41918-0008 THE LITTLE MAN RESENTED HER WORDS AND FLEW INTO SUCH A PASSION THAT HE SEIZED THE NUN BEAT HER AND THREW HER FIRST AGAINST ONE WALL AND THEN AGAINST THE OTHER
5023-41918-0009 IN THE EVENING THE COUNTRYMAN AND THE BLACKSMITH RETURNED HOME AND WHEN THEY FOUND ON DEMANDING THEIR DINNER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR THEM THEY REPROACHED THE NUN BITTERLY
5023-41918-0010 AND PROMISED THAT IF HE REMAINED AT HOME NO ONE SHOULD GO HUNGRY TO BED SO THE OTHER TWO WENT OUT INTO THE FOREST AND THE COUNTRYMAN HAVING PREPARED THE FOOD FOR THE DAY
5023-41918-0011 JUST AS HE HAD FINISHED CLEARING AWAY THE DOOR OPENED AND THE LITTLE GRAY MAN WALKED IN AND THIS TIME HE HAD TWO HEADS HE SHOOK AND TREMBLED AS BEFORE AND EXCLAIMED OH HOW COLD I AM THE COUNTRYMAN
5023-41918-0012 SOON AFTER THE DWARF LOOKED GREEDILY ROUND AND SAID OH
5023-41918-0013 THERE IS FOOD IN THE OVEN SO YOU CAN EAT REPLIED THE COUNTRYMAN THEN THE LITTLE MAN FELL TO WITH BOTH HIS HEADS AND SOON FINISHED THE LAST MORSEL WHEN THE COUNTRYMAN SCOLDED HIM FOR THIS PROCEEDING HE TREATED HIM EXACTLY AS HE HAD DONE THE NUN
5023-41918-0014 AND LEFT THE POOR FELLOW MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE NOW WHEN THE BLACKSMITH CAME HOME WITH THE NUN IN THE EVENING AND FOUND NOTHING FOR SUPPER
5023-41918-0015 AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD GO SUPPERLESS TO BED WHEN DAY DAWNED THE COUNTRYMAN AND THE NUN SET OUT INTO THE WOOD AND THE BLACKSMITH PREPARED ALL THE FOOD FOR THE DAY AS THE OTHERS HAD DONE AGAIN THE GRAY DWARF ENTERED THE HOUSE WITHOUT KNOCKING AND THIS TIME HE HAD
5023-41918-0016 THREE HEADS WHEN HE COMPLAINED OF COLD THE BLACKSMITH TOLD HIM TO SIT NEAR THE FIRE AND WHEN HE SAID HE WAS HUNGRY THE BLACKSMITH PUT SOME FOOD ON A PLATE AND GAVE IT TO HIM THE DWARF MADE SHORT WORK OF WHAT WAS PROVIDED FOR HIM
5023-41918-0017 AND THEN LOOKING GREEDILY ROUND WITH HIS SIX EYES HE DEMANDED MORE WHEN THE BLACKSMITH REFUSED TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER MORSEL HE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE
5023-41918-0018 BUT THE BLACKSMITH WAS A MATCH FOR HIM FOR HE SEIZED A HUGE HAMMER AND STRUCK OFF TWO OF THE DWARF'S HEADS WITH IT THE LITTLE MAN YELLED WITH PAIN AND RAGE AND HASTILY FLED FROM THE HOUSE THE BLACKSMITH RAN AFTER HIM AND PURSUED HIM FOR A LONG WAY
5023-41918-0019 BUT AT LAST THEY CAME TO AN IRON DOOR AND THROUGH IT THE LITTLE CREATURE VANISHED THE DOOR SHUT BEHIND HIM AND THE BLACKSMITH HAD TO GIVE UP THE PURSUIT AND RETURN HOME HE FOUND THAT THE NUN AND THE COUNTRYMAN HAD COME BACK IN THE MEANTIME
5023-41918-0020 AND THEY WERE MUCH DELIGHTED WHEN HE PLACED SOME FOOD BEFORE THEM AND SHOWED THEM THE TWO HEADS HE HAD STRUCK OFF WITH HIS HAMMER THE THREE COMPANIONS DETERMINED THERE AND THEN TO FREE THEMSELVES FROM THE POWER OF THE GRAY DWARF AND THE VERY NEXT DAY THEY SET TO WORK TO FIND HIM
5023-41918-0021 THEY ENTERED A LARGE HALL IN WHICH SAT A YOUNG AND LOVELY GIRL WORKING AT A TABLE THE MOMENT SHE SAW THE NUN THE BLACKSMITH AND THE COUNTRYMAN
5023-41918-0022 SHE TOLD THEM THAT SHE WAS A KING'S DAUGHTER WHO HAD BEEN SHUT UP IN THE CASTLE BY A MIGHTY MAGICIAN THE DAY BEFORE JUST ABOUT NOON SHE HAD SUDDENLY FELT THE MAGIC POWER OVER HER DISAPPEAR AND EVER SINCE THAT MOMENT
5023-41918-0023 SHE HAD EAGERLY AWAITED THE ARRIVAL OF HER DELIVERERS SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT THERE WAS YET ANOTHER PRINCESS SHUT UP IN THE CASTLE WHO HAD ALSO FALLEN UNDER THE MIGHT OF THE MAGICIAN
5023-41918-0024 THEY WANDERED THROUGH MANY HALLS AND ROOMS TILL AT LAST THEY FOUND THE SECOND PRINCESS WHO WAS QUITE AS GRATEFUL AS THE FIRST
5023-41918-0025 THEN THE PRINCESSES TOLD THEIR RESCUERS THAT A GREAT TREASURE LAY HIDDEN IN THE CELLARS OF THE CASTLE
5023-41918-0026 NOTHING DAUNTED THEY ALL WENT DOWN BELOW AT ONCE AND FOUND THE FIERCE ANIMAL MOUNTING GUARD OVER THE TREASURE AS THE PRINCESSES HAD SAID BUT ONE BLOW FROM THE BLACKSMITH'S HAMMER SOON MADE AN END OF THE MONSTER
5023-41918-0027 AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A VAULTED CHAMBER FULL OF GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES BESIDE THE TREASURE STOOD A YOUNG AND HANDSOME MAN WHO ADVANCED TO MEET THEM AND THANKED THE NUN THE BLACKSMITH AND THE COUNTRYMAN FOR HAVING FREED HIM FROM THE MAGIC SPELL HE WAS UNDER
5023-41918-0028 AND THAT HE HAD BEEN CHANGED INTO THE THREE HEADED DWARF WHEN HE HAD LOST TWO OF HIS HEADS THE MAGIC POWER OVER THE TWO PRINCESSES HAD BEEN REMOVED AND WHEN THE BLACKSMITH HAD KILLED THE HORRIBLE DOG THEN HE TOO HAD BEEN SET FREE TO SHOW HIS GRATITUDE
