639-124526-0010 MAY I JOIN YOU IN THE HONOR OF HAVING SOMETHING THE MATTER YES THANKS NO I THINK IT'S THE TOWN BECAUSE THEY ENJOY SKATING MORE THAN BIOLOGY BUT I'M NOT ONLY MORE INTERESTED IN BIOLOGY THAN THE JOLLY SEVENTEEN

639-124526-0012 IT'S MERELY I'M A CONFIRMED DOUBTER OF MYSELF PROBABLY I'M CONCEITED ABOUT MY LACK OF CONCEIT ANYWAY GOPHER PRAIRIE ISN'T PARTICULARLY BAD IT'S LIKE ALL VILLAGES IN ALL COUNTRIES MOST PLACES THAT HAVE LOST THE SMELL OF EARTH
639-124526-0013 BUT NOT YET ACQUIRED THE SMELL OF PATCHOULI OR OF FACTORY SMOKE ARE JUST AS SUSPICIOUS AND RIGHTEOUS I WONDER IF THE SMALL TOWN ISN'T WITH SOME LOVELY EXCEPTIONS A SOCIAL APPENDIX SOME DAY THESE DULL MARKET TOWNS MAY BE AS OBSOLETE AS MONASTERIES
639-124526-0014 SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY YOU WHY DO YOU STAY HERE I HAVE THE VILLAGE VIRUS IT SOUNDS DANGEROUS IT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CANCER THAT WILL CERTAINLY GET ME AT FIFTY UNLESS I STOP THIS SMOKING
639-124526-0015 THE VILLAGE VIRUS IS THE GERM WHICH IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY LIKE THE HOOK WORM IT INFECTS AMBITIOUS PEOPLE WHO STAY TOO LONG IN THE PROVINCES YOU'LL FIND IT EPIDEMIC AMONG LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND MINISTERS AND COLLEGE BRED MERCHANTS
639-124526-0016 HE DROPPED INTO THE SHRIEKING DESK CHAIR HE LOOKED SQUARELY AT HER SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS A MAN AND LONELY THEY WERE EMBARRASSED THEY ELABORATELY GLANCED AWAY AND WERE RELIEVED AS HE WENT ON
639-124526-0017 THE DIAGNOSIS OF MY VILLAGE VIRUS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH I WAS BORN IN AN OHIO TOWN ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS GOPHER PRAIRIE AND MUCH LESS FRIENDLY IT'D HAD MORE GENERATIONS IN WHICH TO FORM AN OLIGARCHY OF RESPECTABILITY
639-124526-0018 HERE A STRANGER IS TAKEN IN IF HE IS CORRECT IF HE LIKES HUNTING AND MOTORING AND GOD AND OUR SENATOR THERE WE DIDN'T TAKE IN EVEN OUR OWN TILL WE HAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY GOT USED TO THEM
639-124526-0019 I WENT TO A DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE AND LEARNED THAT SINCE DICTATING THE BIBLE AND HIRING A PERFECT RACE OF MINISTERS TO EXPLAIN IT GOD HAS NEVER DONE MUCH BUT CREEP AROUND AND TRY TO CATCH US DISOBEYING IT FROM COLLEGE I WENT TO NEW YORK TO THE COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL
639-124526-0020 AND FOR FOUR YEARS I LIVED OH I WON'T RHAPSODIZE ABOUT NEW YORK IT WAS DIRTY AND NOISY AND BREATHLESS AND GHASTLY EXPENSIVE BUT COMPARED WITH THE MOLDY ACADEMY IN WHICH I HAD BEEN SMOTHERED I WENT TO SYMPHONIES TWICE A WEEK
639-124526-0021 FROM THE TOP GALLERY I WALKED IN GRAMERCY PARK AND I READ OH EVERYTHING THROUGH A COUSIN I LEARNED THAT JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH WAS SICK AND NEEDED A PARTNER I CAME HERE JULIUS GOT WELL
639-124526-0022 I THOUGHT I WAS KEEPING UP BUT I GUESS THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ALREADY I WAS READING FOUR COPIES OF CHEAP FICTION MAGAZINES TO ONE POEM I'D PUT OFF THE MINNEAPOLIS TRIPS TILL I SIMPLY HAD TO GO THERE ON A LOT OF LEGAL MATTERS
639-124526-0023 A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS TALKING TO A PATENT LAWYER FROM CHICAGO AND I REALIZED THAT I'D ALWAYS FELT SO SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE LIKE JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH BUT I SAW THAT I WAS AS PROVINCIAL AND BEHIND THE TIMES AS JULIUS WORSE
639-124526-0024 THEN I FOUND THAT THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ABSOLUTE I DIDN'T WANT TO FACE NEW STREETS AND YOUNGER MEN REAL COMPETITION IT WAS TOO EASY TO GO ON MAKING OUT CONVEYANCES AND ARGUING DITCHING CASES SO
639-124526-0025 THAT'S ALL OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF A LIVING DEAD MAN EXCEPT THE DIVERTING LAST CHAPTER THE LIES ABOUT MY HAVING BEEN A TOWER OF STRENGTH AND LEGAL WISDOM WHICH SOME DAY A PREACHER WILL SPIN OVER MY LEAN DRY BODY
639-124526-0026 HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS TABLE DESK FINGERING THE STARRY ENAMELED VASE SHE COULD NOT COMMENT SHE PICTURED HERSELF RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOM TO PAT HIS HAIR SHE SAW THAT HIS LIPS WERE FIRM UNDER HIS SOFT FADED MUSTACHE
639-124526-0027 SHE SAT STILL AND MAUNDERED I KNOW THE VILLAGE VIRUS PERHAPS IT WILL GET ME SOME DAY I'M GOING OH NO MATTER AT LEAST I AM MAKING YOU TALK
639-124526-0028 USUALLY YOU HAVE TO BE POLITE TO MY GARRULOUSNESS BUT NOW I'M SITTING AT YOUR FEET IT WOULD BE RATHER NICE TO HAVE YOU LITERALLY SITTING AT MY FEET BY A FIRE WOULD YOU HAVE A FIREPLACE FOR ME NATURALLY PLEASE DON'T SNUB ME NOW
639-124526-0029 LET THE OLD MAN RAVE HOW OLD ARE YOU CAROL TWENTY SIX GUY TWENTY SIX I WAS JUST LEAVING NEW YORK AT TWENTY SIX I HEARD PATTI SING AT TWENTY SIX AND NOW I'M FORTY SEVEN
639-124526-0030 I FEEL LIKE A CHILD YET I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR FATHER SO IT'S DECENTLY PATERNAL TO IMAGINE YOU CURLED AT MY FEET OF COURSE I HOPE IT ISN'T BUT WE'LL REFLECT THE MORALS OF GOPHER PRAIRIE BY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCING THAT IT IS THESE STANDARDS THAT YOU AND I LIVE UP TO
639-124526-0031 THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S THE MATTER WITH GOPHER PRAIRIE AT LEAST WITH THE RULING CLASS THERE IS A RULING CLASS DESPITE ALL OUR PROFESSIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE PENALTY WE TRIBAL RULERS PAY IS THAT OUR SUBJECTS WATCH US EVERY MINUTE
639-124526-0032 WE CAN'T GET WHOLESOMELY DRUNK AND RELAX WE HAVE TO BE SO CORRECT ABOUT SEX MORALS AND INCONSPICUOUS CLOTHES AND DOING OUR COMMERCIAL TRICKERY ONLY IN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS THAT NONE OF US CAN LIVE UP TO IT AND WE BECOME HORRIBLY HYPOCRITICAL UNAVOIDABLY
639-124526-0033 THE WIDOW ROBBING DEACON OF FICTION CAN'T HELP BEING HYPOCRITICAL THE WIDOWS THEMSELVES DEMAND IT THEY ADMIRE HIS UNCTUOUSNESS AND LOOK AT ME SUPPOSE I DID DARE TO MAKE LOVE TO SOME EXQUISITE MARRIED WOMAN I WOULDN'T ADMIT IT TO MYSELF
639-124526-0034 WHEN I GET HOLD OF ONE IN CHICAGO YET I SHOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO HOLD YOUR HAND I'M BROKEN IT'S THE HISTORICAL ANGLO SAXON WAY OF MAKING LIFE MISERABLE
639-124526-0035 GUY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING WITH THE TOWN REALLY NO WE CAN'T HE DISPOSED OF IT LIKE A JUDGE RULING OUT AN IMPROPER OBJECTION RETURNED TO MATTERS LESS UNCOMFORTABLY ENERGETIC CURIOUS
639-124526-0036 MOST TROUBLES ARE UNNECESSARY WE HAVE NATURE BEATEN WE CAN MAKE HER GROW WHEAT WE CAN KEEP WARM WHEN SHE SENDS BLIZZARDS SO WE RAISE THE DEVIL JUST FOR PLEASURE WARS POLITICS RACE HATREDS LABOR DISPUTES
639-124526-0037 HERE IN GOPHER PRAIRIE WE'VE CLEARED THE FIELDS AND BECOME SOFT SO WE MAKE OURSELVES UNHAPPY ARTIFICIALLY AT GREAT EXPENSE AND EXERTION METHODISTS DISLIKING EPISCOPALIANS THE MAN WITH THE HUDSON LAUGHING AT THE MAN WITH THE FLIVVER
639-124526-0038 THE WORST IS THE COMMERCIAL HATRED THE GROCER FEELING THAT ANY MAN WHO DOESN'T DEAL WITH HIM IS ROBBING HIM WHAT HURTS ME IS THAT IT APPLIES TO LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND DECIDEDLY TO THEIR WIVES AS MUCH AS TO GROCERS THE DOCTORS YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
639-124526-0039 HOW YOUR HUSBAND AND WESTLAKE AND GOULD DISLIKE ONE ANOTHER
639-124526-0040 HE GRINNED OH MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE WHEN WILL HAS POSITIVELY KNOWN OF A CASE WHERE DOCTOR
639-124526-0041 WHERE ONE OF THE OTHERS HAS CONTINUED TO CALL ON PATIENTS LONGER THAN NECESSARY HE HAS LAUGHED ABOUT IT BUT HE STILL GRINNED NO REALLY AND WHEN YOU SAY THE WIVES OF THE DOCTORS SHARE THESE JEALOUSIES

639-124526-0046 SHE WONDERED IF SHE OUGHT TO BE OFFENDED BY HIS CARESS THEN SHE WONDERED IF HE LIKED HER HAT THE NEW ORIENTAL TURBAN OF ROSE AND SILVER BROCADE HE DROPPED HER HAND HIS ELBOW BRUSHED HER SHOULDER HE FLITTED OVER TO THE DESK CHAIR HIS THIN BACK STOOPED
639-124526-0047 ACROSS IT HE PEERED AT HER WITH SUCH LONELINESS THAT SHE WAS STARTLED BUT HIS EYES FADED INTO IMPERSONALITY AS HE TALKED OF THE JEALOUSIES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE HE STOPPED HIMSELF WITH A SHARP GOOD LORD CAROL YOU'RE NOT A JURY

639-124526-0052 IT HURTS ME IN YOU IT'S LIKE BLOOD ON THE WING OF A HUMMING BIRD I'M NOT A HUMMING BIRD I'M A HAWK A TINY LEASHED HAWK PECKED TO DEATH BY THESE LARGE WHITE FLABBY WORMY HENS BUT I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR CONFIRMING ME IN THE FAITH
