245-122647-0000 YET A MONTH ELAPSED BEFORE I QUITTED GATESHEAD I WISHED TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FUNERAL BUT GEORGIANA ENTREATED ME TO STAY TILL SHE COULD GET OFF TO LONDON WHITHER
245-122647-0001 SHE WAS NOW AT LAST INVITED BY HER UNCLE MISTER GIBSON
245-122647-0002 GEORGIANA SAID SHE DREADED BEING LEFT ALONE WITH ELIZA FROM HER SHE GOT NEITHER SYMPATHY IN HER DEJECTION SUPPORT IN HER FEARS NOR AID IN HER PREPARATIONS
245-122647-0003 IT IS TRUE THAT WHILE I WORKED SHE WOULD IDLE AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF YOU AND I WERE DESTINED
245-122647-0004 I SHOULD ASSIGN YOU YOUR SHARE OF LABOUR AND COMPEL YOU TO ACCOMPLISH IT OR ELSE IT SHOULD BE LEFT UNDONE
245-122647-0005 I SHOULD INSIST ALSO ON YOUR KEEPING SOME OF THOSE DRAWLING HALF INSINCERE COMPLAINTS HUSHED IN YOUR OWN BREAST
245-122647-0006 THAT I CONSENT THUS TO RENDER IT SO PATIENT AND COMPLIANT ON MY PART AT LAST I SAW GEORGIANA OFF
245-122647-0007 SHE STAYED IN HER OWN ROOM HER DOOR BOLTED WITHIN FILLING TRUNKS EMPTYING DRAWERS BURNING PAPERS AND HOLDING NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANY ONE
245-122647-0008 SHE WISHED ME TO LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE TO SEE CALLERS AND ANSWER NOTES OF CONDOLENCE
245-122647-0009 AND SHE ADDED I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR VALUABLE SERVICES AND DISCREET CONDUCT THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIVING WITH SUCH AN ONE AS YOU AND WITH GEORGIANA
245-122647-0010 YOU PERFORM YOUR OWN PART IN LIFE AND BURDEN NO ONE TO MORROW SHE CONTINUED I SET OUT FOR THE CONTINENT I SHALL TAKE UP MY ABODE IN A RELIGIOUS HOUSE NEAR LISLE
245-122647-0011 A NUNNERY YOU WOULD CALL IT THERE I SHALL BE QUIET AND UNMOLESTED
245-122647-0012 DECENTLY AND IN ORDER I SHALL EMBRACE THE TENETS OF ROME AND PROBABLY TAKE THE VEIL I NEITHER EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT THIS RESOLUTION
245-122647-0013 NOR ATTEMPTED TO DISSUADE HER FROM IT THE VOCATION WILL FIT YOU TO A HAIR I THOUGHT MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO YOU WHEN WE PARTED SHE SAID GOOD BYE COUSIN JANE EYRE I WISH YOU WELL
245-122647-0014 YOU HAVE SOME SENSE I THEN RETURNED YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT SENSE COUSIN ELIZA BUT WHAT YOU HAVE I SUPPOSE IN ANOTHER YEAR WILL BE WALLED UP ALIVE IN A FRENCH CONVENT
245-122647-0015 HOWEVER IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS AND SO IT SUITS YOU I DON'T MUCH CARE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT SAID SHE AND WITH THESE WORDS WE EACH WENT OUR SEPARATE WAY
245-122647-0016 AS I SHALL NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFER EITHER TO HER OR HER SISTER AGAIN I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE THAT GEORGIANA MADE AN ADVANTAGEOUS MATCH WITH A WEALTHY WORN OUT MAN OF FASHION
245-122647-0017 AND THAT ELIZA ACTUALLY TOOK THE VEIL AND IS AT THIS DAY SUPERIOR OF THE CONVENT WHERE SHE PASSED THE PERIOD OF HER NOVITIATE AND WHICH SHE ENDOWED WITH HER FORTUNE
245-122647-0018 HOW PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY ARE RETURNING HOME FROM AN ABSENCE LONG OR SHORT I DID NOT KNOW I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE SENSATION
245-122647-0019 TO LONG FOR A PLENTEOUS MEAL AND A GOOD FIRE AND TO BE UNABLE TO GET EITHER NEITHER OF THESE RETURNINGS WAS VERY PLEASANT OR DESIRABLE
245-122647-0020 NO MAGNET DREW ME TO A GIVEN POINT INCREASING IN ITS STRENGTH OF ATTRACTION THE NEARER I CAME THE RETURN TO THORNFIELD WAS YET TO BE TRIED
245-122647-0021 MY JOURNEY SEEMED TEDIOUS VERY TEDIOUS FIFTY MILES ONE DAY A NIGHT SPENT AT AN INN FIFTY MILES THE NEXT DAY
245-122647-0022 DURING THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS I THOUGHT OF MISSUS REED IN HER LAST MOMENTS I SAW HER DISFIGURED AND DISCOLOURED FACE AND HEARD HER
245-122647-0023 STRANGELY ALTERED VOICE I MUSED ON THE FUNERAL DAY THE COFFIN THE HEARSE THE BLACK TRAIN OF TENANTS AND SERVANTS FEW WAS THE NUMBER OF RELATIVES
245-122647-0024 THE GAPING VAULT THE SILENT CHURCH THE SOLEMN SERVICE
245-122647-0025 OF A BALL ROOM THE OTHER THE INMATE OF A CONVENT CELL AND I DWELT ON AND ANALYSED THEIR SEPARATE PECULIARITIES OF PERSON AND CHARACTER
245-122647-0026 THE EVENING ARRIVAL AT THE GREAT TOWN OF SCATTERED THESE THOUGHTS NIGHT GAVE THEM QUITE ANOTHER TURN
245-122647-0027 I LEFT REMINISCENCE FOR ANTICIPATION I WAS GOING BACK TO THORNFIELD BUT HOW LONG WAS I TO STAY THERE NOT LONG OF THAT I WAS SURE
245-122647-0028 I HAD HEARD FROM MISSUS FAIRFAX IN THE INTERIM OF MY ABSENCE THE PARTY AT THE HALL WAS DISPERSED MISTER ROCHESTER HAD LEFT FOR LONDON THREE WEEKS AGO
245-122647-0029 MISSUS FAIRFAX SURMISED
245-122647-0030 AS HE HAD TALKED OF PURCHASING A NEW CARRIAGE SHE SAID THE IDEA OF HIS MARRYING MISS INGRAM STILL SEEMED STRANGE TO HER BUT FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAID
245-122647-0031 AND MISTER ROCHESTER LOOKED ON WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED SMILING SARDONICALLY AS IT SEEMED AT BOTH HER AND ME I HAD NOT NOTIFIED TO MISSUS FAIRFAX THE EXACT
245-122647-0032 FOR I DID NOT WISH EITHER CAR OR CARRIAGE TO MEET ME AT MILLCOTE I PROPOSED TO WALK THE DISTANCE QUIETLY BY MYSELF AND VERY QUIETLY AFTER LEAVING MY BOX IN THE OSTLER'S CARE
245-122647-0033 DID I SLIP AWAY FROM THE GEORGE INN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK OF A JUNE EVENING AND TAKE THE OLD ROAD TO THORNFIELD A ROAD WHICH LAY CHIEFLY THROUGH FIELDS AND WAS NOW LITTLE FREQUENTED
245-122647-0034 IT WAS NOT A BRIGHT OR SPLENDID SUMMER EVENING THOUGH FAIR AND SOFT THE HAYMAKERS WERE AT WORK ALL ALONG THE ROAD AND THE SKY THOUGH FAR FROM CLOUDLESS
245-122647-0035 WAS SUCH AS PROMISED WELL FOR THE FUTURE ITS BLUE WHERE BLUE WAS VISIBLE WAS MILD AND SETTLED AND ITS CLOUD STRATA HIGH AND THIN
245-122647-0036 THE WEST TOO WAS WARM NO WATERY GLEAM CHILLED IT IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WAS A FIRE LIT AN ALTAR BURNING BEHIND ITS SCREEN OF MARBLED VAPOUR
245-122647-0037 SHONE A GOLDEN REDNESS I FELT GLAD AS THE ROAD SHORTENED BEFORE ME SO GLAD THAT I STOPPED ONCE TO ASK MYSELF
245-122647-0038 MISSUS FAIRFAX WILL SMILE YOU A CALM WELCOME TO BE SURE SAID I AND LITTLE ADELE WILL CLAP HER HANDS AND JUMP TO SEE YOU
245-122647-0039 AND YOU ARE PARTED FROM HIM FOR EVER AND THEN I STRANGLED A NEW BORN AGONY A DEFORMED THING WHICH I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO OWN AND REAR AND RAN ON
245-122647-0040 THEY ARE MAKING HAY TOO IN THORNFIELD MEADOWS OR RATHER THE LABOURERS ARE JUST QUITTING THEIR WORK AND RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR RAKES ON THEIR SHOULDERS
245-122647-0041 NOW AT THE HOUR I ARRIVE I HAVE BUT A FIELD OR TWO TO TRAVERSE AND THEN I SHALL CROSS THE ROAD AND REACH THE GATES
245-122647-0042 HOW FULL THE HEDGES ARE OF ROSES BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO GATHER ANY I WANT TO BE AT THE HOUSE I PASSED A TALL BRIAR SHOOTING LEAFY AND FLOWERY BRANCHES ACROSS THE PATH
245-122647-0043 I SEE THE NARROW STILE WITH STONE STEPS AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER SITTING THERE A BOOK AND A PENCIL IN HIS HAND HE IS WRITING
245-122647-0044 WELL HE IS NOT A GHOST YET EVERY NERVE I HAVE IS UNSTRUNG FOR A MOMENT I AM BEYOND MY OWN MASTERY WHAT DOES IT MEAN
245-122647-0045 I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD TREMBLE IN THIS WAY WHEN I SAW HIM OR LOSE MY VOICE OR THE POWER OF MOTION IN HIS PRESENCE I WILL GO BACK AS SOON AS I CAN STIR
245-122647-0046 I NEED NOT MAKE AN ABSOLUTE FOOL OF MYSELF I KNOW ANOTHER WAY TO THE HOUSE IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY IF I KNEW TWENTY WAYS FOR HE HAS SEEN ME
245-122647-0047 HILLO HE CRIES AND HE PUTS UP HIS BOOK AND HIS PENCIL THERE YOU ARE COME ON IF YOU PLEASE I SUPPOSE I DO COME ON
245-122647-0048 WHICH I FEEL REBEL INSOLENTLY AGAINST MY WILL AND STRUGGLE TO EXPRESS WHAT I HAD RESOLVED TO CONCEAL BUT I HAVE A VEIL IT IS DOWN
245-122647-0049 NOT TO SEND FOR A CARRIAGE AND COME CLATTERING OVER STREET AND ROAD LIKE A COMMON MORTAL BUT TO STEAL INTO THE VICINAGE OF YOUR HOME ALONG WITH TWILIGHT
245-122647-0050 WHAT THE DEUCE HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOURSELF THIS LAST MONTH I HAVE BEEN WITH MY AUNT SIR WHO IS DEAD
245-122647-0051 DEAD AND TELLS ME SO WHEN SHE MEETS ME ALONE HERE IN THE GLOAMING IF I DARED I'D TOUCH YOU TO SEE IF YOU ARE SUBSTANCE OR SHADOW YOU ELF
245-122647-0052 BUT I'D AS SOON OFFER TO TAKE HOLD OF A BLUE IGNIS FATUUS LIGHT IN A MARSH TRUANT TRUANT HE ADDED WHEN HE HAD PAUSED AN INSTANT
245-122647-0053 ABSENT FROM ME A WHOLE MONTH AND FORGETTING ME QUITE I'LL BE SWORN I KNEW THERE WOULD BE PLEASURE IN MEETING MY MASTER AGAIN
245-122647-0054 THAT HE WAS SO SOON TO CEASE TO BE MY MASTER
245-122647-0055 BUT OF THE CRUMBS HE SCATTERED TO STRAY AND STRANGER BIRDS LIKE ME WAS TO FEAST GENIALLY HIS LAST WORDS WERE BALM THEY SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT IT IMPORTED SOMETHING TO HIM
245-122647-0056 HE DID NOT LEAVE THE STILE AND I HARDLY LIKED TO ASK TO GO BY I INQUIRED SOON IF HE HAD NOT BEEN TO LONDON
245-122647-0057 MISSUS FAIRFAX TOLD ME IN A LETTER AND DID SHE INFORM YOU WHAT I WENT TO
245-122647-0058 OH YES SIR EVERYBODY KNEW YOUR ERRAND YOU MUST SEE THE CARRIAGE JANE AND TELL ME IF YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL SUIT MISSUS ROCHESTER EXACTLY
245-122647-0059 AND WHETHER SHE WON'T LOOK LIKE QUEEN BOADICEA LEANING BACK AGAINST THOSE PURPLE CUSHIONS I WISH JANE I WERE A TRIFLE BETTER ADAPTED TO MATCH WITH HER EXTERNALLY
245-122647-0060 IT WOULD BE PAST THE POWER OF MAGIC SIR AND IN THOUGHT I ADDED A LOVING EYE IS ALL THE CHARM NEEDED TO SUCH YOU ARE HANDSOME ENOUGH
245-122647-0061 YOUR STERNNESS HAS A POWER BEYOND BEAUTY MISTER ROCHESTER HAD SOMETIMES READ MY UNSPOKEN THOUGHTS WITH AN ACUMEN TO ME INCOMPREHENSIBLE
245-122647-0062 IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF MY ABRUPT VOCAL RESPONSE BUT HE SMILED AT ME WITH A CERTAIN SMILE HE HAD OF HIS OWN
245-122647-0063 AND WHICH HE USED BUT ON RARE OCCASIONS HE SEEMED TO THINK IT TOO GOOD FOR COMMON PURPOSES IT WAS THE REAL SUNSHINE OF FEELING HE SHED IT OVER ME NOW PASS
245-122647-0064 JANET SAID HE MAKING ROOM FOR ME TO CROSS THE STILE GO UP HOME AND STAY YOUR WEARY LITTLE WANDERING FEET AT A FRIEND'S THRESHOLD
245-122647-0065 ALL I HAD NOW TO DO WAS TO OBEY HIM IN SILENCE NO NEED FOR ME TO COLLOQUISE FURTHER I GOT OVER THE STILE WITHOUT A WORD
245-122647-0066 AND MEANT TO LEAVE HIM CALMLY AN IMPULSE HELD ME FAST A FORCE TURNED ME ROUND I SAID OR SOMETHING IN ME SAID FOR ME
245-122647-0067 AND IN SPITE OF ME THANK YOU MISTER ROCHESTER FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS I AM STRANGELY GLAD TO GET BACK AGAIN TO YOU AND WHEREVER YOU ARE IS MY HOME
245-122647-0068 MY ONLY HOME I WALKED ON SO FAST THAT EVEN HE COULD HARDLY HAVE OVERTAKEN ME HAD HE TRIED LITTLE ADELE WAS HALF WILD WITH DELIGHT WHEN SHE SAW ME
245-122647-0069 MISSUS FAIRFAX RECEIVED ME WITH HER USUAL PLAIN FRIENDLINESS LEAH SMILED AND EVEN SOPHIE BID ME BON SOIR WITH GLEE
245-122647-0070 I THAT EVENING SHUT MY EYES RESOLUTELY AGAINST THE FUTURE
245-122647-0071 AGAINST THE VOICE THAT KEPT WARNING ME OF NEAR SEPARATION AND COMING GRIEF
245-122647-0072 KNEELING ON THE CARPET HAD NESTLED CLOSE UP TO ME AND A SENSE OF MUTUAL AFFECTION SEEMED TO SURROUND US WITH A RING OF GOLDEN PEACE I UTTERED A SILENT PRAYER
245-122647-0073 THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE PARTED FAR OR SOON BUT WHEN AS WE THUS SAT MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERED UNANNOUNCED AND LOOKING AT US
245-122647-0074 SEEMED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF A GROUP SO AMICABLE WHEN HE SAID HE SUPPOSED THE OLD LADY WAS ALL RIGHT NOW THAT SHE HAD GOT HER ADOPTED DAUGHTER BACK AGAIN
245-122647-0075 AND ADDED THAT HE SAW ADELE WAS PRETE A
245-122647-0076 ONCE SHE SAID SHE HAD ACTUALLY PUT THE QUESTION TO MISTER ROCHESTER AS TO WHEN HE WAS GOING TO BRING HIS BRIDE HOME BUT HE HAD ANSWERED HER
245-122647-0077 NO VISITS TO INGRAM PARK TO BE SURE IT WAS TWENTY MILES OFF ON THE BORDERS OF ANOTHER COUNTY BUT WHAT WAS THAT DISTANCE TO AN ARDENT LOVER
245-122647-0078 TO SO PRACTISED AND INDEFATIGABLE A HORSEMAN AS MISTER ROCHESTER IT WOULD BE BUT A MORNING'S RIDE I BEGAN TO CHERISH HOPES I HAD NO RIGHT TO CONCEIVE
245-122647-0079 THAT THE MATCH WAS BROKEN OFF THAT RUMOUR HAD BEEN MISTAKEN THAT ONE OR BOTH PARTIES HAD CHANGED THEIR MINDS I USED TO LOOK AT MY MASTER'S FACE TO SEE IF IT WERE SAD OR FIERCE
