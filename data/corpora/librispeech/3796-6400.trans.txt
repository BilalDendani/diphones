3796-6400-0000 WHEN HE BROKE THE SHORT SILENCE IT WAS TO REMARK THAT CONCESSIONS FLEW ABOUT THICK IN THE AIR OF COSTAGUANA ANY SIMPLE SOUL THAT JUST YEARNED TO BE TAKEN IN COULD BRING DOWN A CONCESSION AT THE FIRST SHOT
3796-6400-0001 OUR CONSULS GET THEIR MOUTHS STOPPED WITH THEM HE CONTINUED WITH A TWINKLE OF GENIAL SCORN IN HIS EYES BUT IN A MOMENT HE BECAME GRAVE A CONSCIENTIOUS UPRIGHT MAN THAT CARES NOTHING FOR BOODLE
3796-6400-0002 AND KEEPS CLEAR OF THEIR INTRIGUES CONSPIRACIES AND FACTIONS SOON GETS HIS PASSPORTS SEE THAT MISTER GOULD PERSONA NON GRATA THAT'S THE REASON OUR GOVERNMENT IS NEVER PROPERLY INFORMED
3796-6400-0003 ON THE OTHER HAND EUROPE MUST BE KEPT OUT OF THIS CONTINENT AND FOR PROPER INTERFERENCE ON OUR PART THE TIME IS NOT YET RIPE I DARE SAY BUT WE HERE WE ARE NOT THIS COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT NEITHER ARE WE SIMPLE SOULS YOUR AFFAIR IS ALL RIGHT
3796-6400-0004 THE MAIN QUESTION FOR US IS WHETHER THE SECOND PARTNER AND THAT'S YOU IS THE RIGHT SORT TO HOLD HIS OWN AGAINST THE THIRD AND UNWELCOME PARTNER WHICH IS ONE OR ANOTHER OF THE HIGH AND MIGHTY ROBBER GANGS THAT RUN THE COSTAGUANA GOVERNMENT
3796-6400-0005 HE BENT FORWARD TO LOOK STEADILY INTO THE UNFLINCHING EYES OF CHARLES GOULD WHO REMEMBERING THE LARGE BOX FULL OF HIS FATHER'S LETTERS PUT THE ACCUMULATED SCORN AND BITTERNESS OF MANY YEARS INTO THE TONE OF HIS ANSWER
3796-6400-0006 AS FAR AS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THESE MEN AND THEIR METHODS AND THEIR POLITICS IS CONCERNED I CAN ANSWER FOR MYSELF I HAVE BEEN FED ON THAT SORT OF KNOWLEDGE SINCE I WAS A BOY I AM NOT LIKELY TO FALL INTO MISTAKES FROM EXCESS OF OPTIMISM
3796-6400-0007 NOT LIKELY EH THAT'S ALL RIGHT TACT AND A STIFF UPPER LIP IS WHAT YOU'LL WANT AND YOU COULD BLUFF A LITTLE ON THE STRENGTH OF YOUR BACKING
3796-6400-0008 BUT WE WON'T BE DRAWN INTO ANY LARGE TROUBLE THIS IS THE EXPERIMENT WHICH I AM WILLING TO MAKE
3796-6400-0009 BUT IF YOU CAN'T KEEP UP YOUR END WE WILL STAND OUR LOSS OF COURSE AND THEN WE'LL LET THE THING GO THIS MINE CAN WAIT IT HAS BEEN SHUT UP BEFORE AS YOU KNOW YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
3796-6400-0010 THUS THE GREAT PERSONAGE HAD SPOKEN THEN IN HIS OWN PRIVATE OFFICE IN A GREAT CITY
3796-6400-0011 AND RATHER MORE THAN A YEAR LATER DURING HIS UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE IN SULACO HE HAD EMPHASIZED HIS UNCOMPROMISING ATTITUDE WITH A FREEDOM OF SINCERITY PERMITTED TO HIS WEALTH AND INFLUENCE
3796-6400-0012 HAD IMPRESSED HIM WITH THE CONVICTION THAT CHARLES GOULD WAS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF KEEPING UP HIS END
3796-6400-0013 MAY YET BECOME A POWER IN THE LAND THIS THOUGHT FLATTERED HIM FOR HITHERTO THE ONLY ACCOUNT OF THIS YOUNG MAN HE COULD GIVE TO HIS INTIMATES WAS
3796-6400-0014 AND SENT HIM ON TO ME WITH A LETTER HE'S ONE OF THE COSTAGUANA GOULDS PURE BRED ENGLISHMEN BUT ALL BORN IN THE COUNTRY HIS UNCLE WENT INTO POLITICS WAS THE LAST PROVINCIAL PRESIDENT OF SULACO AND GOT SHOT AFTER A BATTLE
3796-6400-0015 AFTER A LOT OF REVOLUTIONS AND THAT'S YOUR COSTAGUANA IN A NUTSHELL OF COURSE HE WAS TOO GREAT A MAN TO BE QUESTIONED AS TO HIS MOTIVES EVEN BY HIS INTIMATES THE OUTSIDE WORLD WAS AT LIBERTY TO WONDER RESPECTFULLY AT THE HIDDEN MEANING OF HIS ACTIONS
3796-6400-0016 HE WAS SO GREAT A MAN THAT HIS LAVISH PATRONAGE OF THE PURER FORMS OF CHRISTIANITY
3796-6400-0017 WAS LOOKED UPON BY HIS FELLOW CITIZENS AS THE MANIFESTATION OF A PIOUS AND HUMBLE SPIRIT BUT IN HIS OWN CIRCLES OF THE FINANCIAL WORLD THE TAKING UP OF SUCH A THING AS THE SAN TOME MINE WAS REGARDED WITH RESPECT INDEED BUT RATHER AS A SUBJECT
3796-6400-0018 FOR DISCREET JOCULARITY IT WAS A GREAT MAN'S CAPRICE IN THE GREAT HOLROYD BUILDING
3796-6400-0019 COBWEBBED ALOFT BY THE RADIATION OF TELEGRAPH WIRES THE HEADS OF PRINCIPAL DEPARTMENTS EXCHANGED HUMOROUS GLANCES
3796-6400-0020 THE COSTAGUANA MAIL IT WAS NEVER LARGE ONE FAIRLY HEAVY ENVELOPE WAS TAKEN UNOPENED STRAIGHT INTO THE GREAT MAN'S ROOM AND NO INSTRUCTIONS DEALING WITH IT HAD EVER BEEN ISSUED THENCE THE OFFICE WHISPERED THAT HE ANSWERED PERSONALLY AND NOT BY DICTATION EITHER
3796-6400-0021 BUT ACTUALLY WRITING IN HIS OWN HAND WITH PEN AND INK AND IT WAS TO BE SUPPOSED TAKING A COPY IN HIS OWN PRIVATE PRESS COPY BOOK INACCESSIBLE TO PROFANE EYES
3796-6400-0022 SOME SCORNFUL YOUNG MEN INSIGNIFICANT PIECES OF MINOR MACHINERY IN THAT ELEVEN STOREY HIGH WORKSHOP OF GREAT AFFAIRS EXPRESSED FRANKLY THEIR PRIVATE OPINION THAT THE GREAT CHIEF HAD DONE AT LAST SOMETHING SILLY AND WAS ASHAMED OF HIS FOLLY
3796-6400-0023 USED TO MUTTER DARKLY AND KNOWINGLY THAT THIS WAS A PORTENTOUS SIGN THAT THE HOLROYD CONNECTION MEANT BY AND BY TO GET HOLD OF THE WHOLE REPUBLIC OF COSTAGUANA LOCK STOCK AND BARREL BUT IN FACT THE HOBBY THEORY WAS THE RIGHT ONE
3796-6400-0024 IT INTERESTED THE GREAT MAN TO ATTEND PERSONALLY TO THE SAN TOME MINE IT INTERESTED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE ALLOWED THIS HOBBY TO GIVE A DIRECTION TO THE FIRST COMPLETE HOLIDAY HE HAD TAKEN FOR QUITE A STARTLING NUMBER OF YEARS HE WAS NOT RUNNING A GREAT ENTERPRISE THERE
3796-6400-0025 NO MERE RAILWAY BOARD OR INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION HE WAS RUNNING A MAN A SUCCESS WOULD HAVE PLEASED HIM VERY MUCH ON REFRESHINGLY NOVEL GROUNDS BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SAME FEELING IT WAS INCUMBENT UPON HIM TO CAST IT OFF UTTERLY AT THE FIRST SIGN OF FAILURE
3796-6400-0026 THE PAPERS HAD UNFORTUNATELY TRUMPETED ALL OVER THE LAND HIS JOURNEY TO COSTAGUANA IF HE WAS PLEASED AT THE WAY CHARLES GOULD WAS GOING ON HE INFUSED AN ADDED GRIMNESS INTO HIS ASSURANCES OF SUPPORT
3796-6400-0027 HAT IN HAND BEHIND MISSUS GOULD'S WHITE MULES
3796-6400-0028 YOU MAY BEGIN SENDING OUT THE MACHINERY AS SOON AS YOU LIKE AND THE GREAT MAN HAD LIKED THIS IMPERTURBABLE ASSURANCE THE SECRET OF IT WAS THAT TO CHARLES GOULD'S MIND THESE UNCOMPROMISING TERMS WERE AGREEABLE LIKE THIS THE MINE PRESERVED ITS IDENTITY
3796-6400-0029 WITH WHICH HE HAD ENDOWED IT AS A BOY AND IT REMAINED DEPENDENT ON HIMSELF ALONE IT WAS A SERIOUS AFFAIR AND HE TOO TOOK IT GRIMLY OF COURSE HE SAID TO HIS WIFE ALLUDING TO THIS LAST CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTED GUEST WHILE THEY WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN THE CORREDOR
3796-6400-0030 OF COURSE A MAN OF THAT SORT CAN TAKE UP A THING OR DROP IT WHEN HE LIKES
3796-6400-0031 AND SOME DAY WILL GET HOLD OF COSTAGUANA ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD THEY HAD STOPPED NEAR THE CAGE THE PARROT CATCHING THE SOUND OF A WORD BELONGING TO HIS VOCABULARY WAS MOVED TO INTERFERE PARROTS ARE VERY HUMAN
3796-6400-0032 VIVA COSTAGUANA HE SHRIEKED WITH INTENSE SELF ASSERTION AND INSTANTLY RUFFLING UP HIS FEATHERS
3796-6400-0033 THIS SEEMS TO ME MOST AWFUL MATERIALISM
3796-6400-0034 MY DEAR IT'S NOTHING TO ME INTERRUPTED HER HUSBAND IN A REASONABLE TONE I MAKE USE OF WHAT I SEE WHAT'S IT TO ME WHETHER HIS TALK IS THE VOICE OF DESTINY OR SIMPLY A BIT OF CLAP TRAP ELOQUENCE
3796-6400-0035 THERE'S A GOOD DEAL OF ELOQUENCE OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER PRODUCED IN BOTH AMERICAS THE AIR OF THE NEW WORLD SEEMS FAVOURABLE TO THE ART OF DECLAMATION HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW DEAR AVELLANOS CAN HOLD FORTH FOR HOURS HERE
3796-6400-0036 OH BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT PROTESTED MISSUS GOULD ALMOST SHOCKED THE ALLUSION WAS NOT TO THE POINT DON JOSE WAS A DEAR GOOD MAN WHO TALKED VERY WELL AND WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE GREATNESS OF THE SAN TOME MINE
3796-6400-0037 HE HAS SUFFERED AND YET HE HOPES THE WORKING COMPETENCE OF MEN WHICH SHE NEVER QUESTIONED WAS VERY SURPRISING TO MISSUS GOULD BECAUSE UPON SO MANY OBVIOUS ISSUES THEY SHOWED THEMSELVES STRANGELY MUDDLE HEADED
3796-6400-0038 CHARLES GOULD WITH A CAREWORN CALMNESS WHICH SECURED FOR HIM AT ONCE HIS WIFE'S ANXIOUS SYMPATHY ASSURED HER THAT HE WAS NOT COMPARING HE WAS AN AMERICAN HIMSELF AFTER ALL AND PERHAPS HE COULD UNDERSTAND BOTH KINDS OF ELOQUENCE
3796-6400-0039 IF IT WERE WORTH WHILE TO TRY HE ADDED GRIMLY BUT HE HAD BREATHED THE AIR OF ENGLAND LONGER THAN ANY OF HIS PEOPLE HAD DONE FOR THREE GENERATIONS AND REALLY HE BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED HIS POOR FATHER COULD BE ELOQUENT TOO
3796-6400-0040 AND HE ASKED HIS WIFE WHETHER SHE REMEMBERED A PASSAGE IN ONE OF HIS FATHER'S LAST LETTERS WHERE MISTER GOULD HAD EXPRESSED THE CONVICTION THAT GOD LOOKED WRATHFULLY AT THESE COUNTRIES OR ELSE HE
3796-6400-0041 WOULD LET SOME RAY OF HOPE FALL THROUGH A RIFT IN THE APPALLING DARKNESS OF INTRIGUE BLOODSHED AND CRIME THAT HUNG OVER THE QUEEN OF CONTINENTS MISSUS GOULD HAD NOT FORGOTTEN YOU READ IT TO ME CHARLEY SHE MURMURED IT WAS A STRIKING PRONOUNCEMENT
3796-6400-0042 HOW DEEPLY YOUR FATHER MUST HAVE FELT ITS TERRIBLE SADNESS HE DID NOT LIKE TO BE ROBBED IT EXASPERATED HIM SAID CHARLES GOULD BUT THE IMAGE WILL SERVE WELL ENOUGH WHAT IS WANTED HERE IS LAW GOOD FAITH ORDER SECURITY
3796-6400-0043 ANY ONE CAN DECLAIM ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT I PIN MY FAITH TO MATERIAL INTERESTS ONLY LET THE MATERIAL INTERESTS ONCE GET A FIRM FOOTING AND THEY ARE BOUND TO IMPOSE THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH ALONE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST
3796-6400-0044 THAT'S HOW YOUR MONEY MAKING IS JUSTIFIED HERE IN THE FACE OF LAWLESSNESS AND DISORDER IT IS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE THE SECURITY WHICH IT DEMANDS MUST BE SHARED WITH AN OPPRESSED PEOPLE A BETTER JUSTICE WILL COME AFTERWARDS THAT'S YOUR RAY OF HOPE
3796-6400-0045 HIS ARM PRESSED HER SLIGHT FORM CLOSER TO HIS SIDE FOR A MOMENT AND WHO KNOWS WHETHER IN THAT SENSE EVEN THE SAN TOME MINE MAY NOT BECOME THAT LITTLE RIFT IN THE DARKNESS WHICH POOR FATHER DESPAIRED OF EVER SEEING SHE GLANCED UP AT HIM WITH ADMIRATION HE WAS COMPETENT
3796-6400-0046 HE HAD GIVEN A VAST SHAPE TO THE VAGUENESS OF HER UNSELFISH AMBITIONS CHARLEY SHE SAID YOU ARE SPLENDIDLY DISOBEDIENT HE LEFT HER SUDDENLY IN THE CORREDOR TO GO AND GET HIS HAT A SOFT GREY SOMBRERO AN ARTICLE OF NATIONAL COSTUME
3796-6400-0047 WHICH COMBINED UNEXPECTEDLY WELL WITH HIS ENGLISH GET UP HE CAME BACK A RIDING WHIP UNDER HIS ARM BUTTONING UP A DOGSKIN GLOVE HIS FACE REFLECTED THE RESOLUTE NATURE OF HIS THOUGHTS
3796-6400-0048 HIS WIFE HAD WAITED FOR HIM AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS AND BEFORE HE GAVE HER THE PARTING KISS HE FINISHED THE CONVERSATION WHAT SHOULD BE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO US HE SAID IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO GOING BACK WHERE COULD WE BEGIN LIFE AFRESH
3796-6400-0049 WE ARE IN NOW FOR ALL THAT THERE IS IN US HE BENT OVER HER UPTURNED FACE VERY TENDERLY AND A LITTLE REMORSEFULLY CHARLES GOULD WAS COMPETENT BECAUSE HE HAD NO ILLUSIONS THE GOULD CONCESSION HAD TO FIGHT FOR LIFE WITH SUCH WEAPONS
3796-6400-0050 HE WAS PREPARED TO STOOP FOR HIS WEAPONS FOR A MOMENT HE FELT AS IF THE SILVER MINE WHICH HAD KILLED HIS FATHER HAD DECOYED HIM FURTHER THAN HE MEANT TO GO AND WITH THE ROUNDABOUT LOGIC OF EMOTIONS HE FELT THAT THE WORTHINESS OF HIS LIFE WAS BOUND UP WITH SUCCESS
