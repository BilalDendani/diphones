764-132280-0000 BUT YET SINCE PRINCES WILL HAVE SUCH THINGS IT IS BETTER THEY SHOULD BE GRACED WITH ELEGANCY THAN DAUBED WITH COST DANCING TO SONG IS A THING OF GREAT STATE AND PLEASURE I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THE SONG BE IN QUIRE
764-132280-0001 PLACED ALOFT AND ACCOMPANIED WITH SOME BROKEN MUSIC AND THE DITTY FITTED TO THE DEVICE ACTING IN SONG ESPECIALLY IN DIALOGUES HATH AN EXTREME GOOD GRACE I SAY ACTING NOT DANCING
764-132280-0002 SEVERAL QUIRES PLACED ONE OVER AGAINST ANOTHER AND TAKING THE VOICE BY CATCHES ANTHEM WISE GIVE GREAT PLEASURE TURNING DANCES INTO FIGURE IS A CHILDISH CURIOSITY AND GENERALLY LET IT BE NOTED
764-132280-0003 THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH I HERE SET DOWN ARE SUCH AS DO NATURALLY TAKE THE SENSE AND NOT RESPECT PETTY WONDERMENTS IT IS TRUE THE ALTERATIONS OF SCENES SO IT BE QUIETLY AND WITHOUT NOISE ARE THINGS OF GREAT BEAUTY AND PLEASURE
764-132280-0004 FOR THEY FEED AND RELIEVE THE EYE BEFORE IT BE FULL OF THE SAME OBJECT LET THE SCENES ABOUND WITH LIGHT SPECIALLY COLORED AND VARIED AND LET THE MASQUERS OR ANY OTHER
764-132280-0005 HAVE SOME MOTIONS UPON THE SCENE ITSELF BEFORE THEIR COMING DOWN FOR IT DRAWS THE EYE STRANGELY AND MAKES IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE TO DESIRE TO SEE THAT IT CANNOT PERFECTLY DISCERN
764-132280-0006 LET THE SUITS OF THE MASQUERS BE GRACEFUL AND SUCH AS BECOME THE PERSON WHEN THE VIZORS ARE OFF NOT AFTER EXAMPLES OF KNOWN ATTIRES TURKE SOLDIERS MARINERS AND THE LIKE
764-132280-0007 IS ON THE OTHER SIDE AS UNFIT BUT CHIEFLY LET THE MUSIC OF THEM BE RECREATIVE AND WITH SOME STRANGE CHANGES SOME SWEET ODORS SUDDENLY COMING FORTH WITHOUT ANY DROPS FALLING ARE
764-132280-0008 IN SUCH A COMPANY AS THERE IS STEAM AND HEAT THINGS OF GREAT PLEASURE AND REFRESHMENT DOUBLE MASQUES ONE OF MEN ANOTHER OF LADIES ADDETH STATE AND VARIETY BUT ALL IS NOTHING EXCEPT THE ROOM BE KEPT CLEAR AND NEAT
764-132280-0009 FOR JUSTS AND TOURNEYS AND BARRIERS THE GLORIES OF THEM ARE CHIEFLY IN THE CHARIOTS WHEREIN THE CHALLENGERS MAKE THEIR ENTRY ESPECIALLY IF THEY BE DRAWN WITH STRANGE BEASTS AS LIONS BEARS CAMELS AND THE LIKE
764-132280-0010 OR IN THE DEVICES OF THEIR ENTRANCE OR IN THE BRAVERY OF THEIR LIVERIES OR IN THE GOODLY FURNITURE OF THEIR HORSES AND ARMOR BUT ENOUGH OF THESE TOYS
764-132280-0011 OF NATURE IN MEN NATURE IS OFTEN HIDDEN SOMETIMES OVERCOME SELDOM EXTINGUISHED FORCE MAKETH NATURE MORE VIOLENT IN THE RETURN DOCTRINE AND DISCOURSE
764-132280-0012 MAKETH NATURE LESS IMPORTUNE BUT CUSTOM ONLY DOTH ALTER AND SUBDUE NATURE HE THAT SEEKETH VICTORY OVER HIS NATURE LET HIM NOT SET HIMSELF TOO GREAT NOR TOO SMALL TASKS
764-132280-0013 FOR THE FIRST WILL MAKE HIM DEJECTED BY OFTEN FAILINGS AND THE SECOND WILL MAKE HIM A SMALL PROCEEDER THOUGH BY OFTEN PREVAILINGS AND AT THE FIRST LET HIM PRACTISE WITH HELPS AS SWIMMERS DO WITH BLADDERS OR RUSHES
764-132280-0014 BUT AFTER A TIME LET HIM PRACTISE WITH DISADVANTAGES AS DANCERS DO WITH THICK SHOES FOR IT BREEDS GREAT PERFECTION IF THE PRACTICE BE HARDER THAN THE USE WHERE NATURE IS MIGHTY AND THEREFORE THE VICTORY HARD
764-132280-0015 THE DEGREES HAD NEED BE FIRST TO STAY AND ARREST NATURE IN TIME LIKE TO HIM THAT WOULD SAY OVER THE FOUR AND TWENTY LETTERS WHEN HE WAS ANGRY THEN TO GO LESS IN QUANTITY AS IF ONE SHOULD IN FORBEARING WINE
764-132280-0016 NEITHER IS THE ANCIENT RULE AMISS TO BEND NATURE AS A WAND TO A CONTRARY EXTREME WHEREBY TO SET IT RIGHT UNDERSTANDING IT WHERE THE CONTRARY EXTREME IS NO VICE
764-132280-0017 LET NOT A MAN FORCE A HABIT UPON HIMSELF WITH A PERPETUAL CONTINUANCE BUT WITH SOME INTERMISSION FOR BOTH THE PAUSE REINFORCETH THE NEW ONSET AND IF A MAN THAT IS NOT PERFECT BE EVER IN PRACTICE
764-132280-0018 HE SHALL AS WELL PRACTISE HIS ERRORS AS HIS ABILITIES AND INDUCE ONE HABIT OF BOTH AND THERE IS NO MEANS TO HELP THIS BUT BY SEASONABLE INTERMISSIONS BUT LET NOT A MAN TRUST HIS VICTORY OVER HIS NATURE TOO FAR
764-132280-0019 FOR NATURE WILL LAY BURIED A GREAT TIME AND YET REVIVE UPON THE OCCASION OR TEMPTATION LIKE AS IT WAS WITH A ESOP'S DAMSEL TURNED FROM A CAT TO A WOMAN WHO SAT VERY DEMURELY AT THE BOARD'S END TILL A MOUSE RAN BEFORE HER
764-132280-0020 THEREFORE LET A MAN EITHER AVOID THE OCCASION ALTOGETHER OR PUT HIMSELF OFTEN TO IT THAT HE MAY BE LITTLE MOVED WITH IT A MAN'S NATURE IS BEST PERCEIVED IN PRIVATENESS FOR THERE IS NO AFFECTATION
764-132280-0021 IN PASSION FOR THAT PUTTETH A MAN OUT OF HIS PRECEPTS AND IN A NEW CASE OR EXPERIMENT FOR THERE CUSTOM LEAVETH HIM THEY ARE HAPPY MEN WHOSE NATURES SORT WITH THEIR VOCATIONS OTHERWISE THEY MAY SAY
764-132280-0022 FOR HIS THOUGHTS WILL FLY TO IT OF THEMSELVES SO AS THE SPACES OF OTHER BUSINESS OR STUDIES WILL SUFFICE A MAN'S NATURE RUNS EITHER TO HERBS OR WEEDS THEREFORE
764-132280-0023 LET HIM SEASONABLY WATER THE ONE AND DESTROY THE OTHER
764-132280-0024 OF CUSTOM AND EDUCATION MEN'S THOUGHTS ARE MUCH ACCORDING TO THEIR INCLINATION THEIR DISCOURSE AND SPEECHES ACCORDING TO THEIR LEARNING AND INFUSED OPINIONS BUT THEIR DEEDS
764-132280-0025 ARE AFTER AS THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED AND THEREFORE AS MACHIAVEL WELL NOTETH THOUGH IN AN EVIL FAVORED INSTANCE THERE IS NO TRUSTING TO THE FORCE OF NATURE NOR TO THE BRAVERY OF WORDS EXCEPT IT BE CORROBORATE BY CUSTOM
764-132280-0026 ONLY SUPERSTITION IS NOW SO WELL ADVANCED THAT MEN OF THE FIRST BLOOD ARE AS FIRM AS BUTCHERS BY OCCUPATION AND VOTARY RESOLUTION IS MADE EQUIPOLLENT TO CUSTOM EVEN IN MATTER OF BLOOD
764-132280-0027 IN OTHER THINGS THE PREDOMINANCY OF CUSTOM IS EVERYWHERE VISIBLE INSOMUCH AS A MAN WOULD WONDER TO HEAR MEN PROFESS PROTEST ENGAGE GIVE GREAT WORDS AND THEN DO JUST AS THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE
764-132280-0028 AS IF THEY WERE DEAD IMAGES AND ENGINES MOVED ONLY BY THE WHEELS OF CUSTOM WE SEE ALSO THE REIGN OR TYRANNY OF CUSTOM WHAT IT IS THE INDIANS I MEAN THE SECT OF THEIR WISE MEN
764-132280-0029 WERE WONT TO BE SCOURGED UPON THE ALTAR OF DIANA WITHOUT SO MUCH AS QUECHING I REMEMBER IN THE BEGINNING OF QUEEN ELIZABETH'S TIME OF ENGLAND AN IRISH REBEL CONDEMNED PUT UP A PETITION TO THE DEPUTY
764-132280-0030 THAT HE MIGHT BE HANGED IN A WITHE AND NOT IN AN HALTER BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO USED WITH FORMER REBELS THERE BE MONKS IN RUSSIA FOR PENANCE THAT WILL SIT A WHOLE NIGHT IN A VESSEL OF WATER
764-132280-0031 TILL THEY BE ENGAGED WITH HARD ICE MANY EXAMPLES MAY BE PUT OF THE FORCE OF CUSTOM BOTH UPON MIND AND BODY THEREFORE SINCE CUSTOM IS THE PRINCIPAL MAGISTRATE OF MAN'S LIFE
764-132280-0032 THE TONGUE IS MORE PLIANT TO ALL EXPRESSIONS AND SOUNDS THE JOINTS ARE MORE SUPPLE TO ALL FEATS OF ACTIVITY AND MOTIONS IN YOUTH THAN AFTERWARDS FOR IT IS TRUE THAT LATE LEARNERS CANNOT SO WELL TAKE THE PLY
764-132280-0033 EXCEPT IT BE IN SOME MINDS THAT HAVE NOT SUFFERED THEMSELVES TO FIX BUT HAVE KEPT THEMSELVES OPEN AND PREPARED TO RECEIVE CONTINUAL AMENDMENT WHICH IS EXCEEDING RARE BUT IF THE FORCE OF CUSTOM SIMPLE AND SEPARATE BE GREAT
764-132280-0034 THE FORCE OF CUSTOM COPULATE AND CONJOINED AND COLLEGIATE IS FAR GREATER FOR THERE EXAMPLE TEACHETH COMPANY COMFORTETH EMULATION QUICKENETH GLORY RAISETH SO AS IN SUCH PLACES
764-132280-0035 THE FORCE OF CUSTOM IS IN HIS EXALTATION CERTAINLY THE GREAT MULTIPLICATION OF VIRTUES UPON HUMAN NATURE RESTETH UPON SOCIETIES WELL ORDAINED AND DISCIPLINED
764-132280-0036 FOR COMMONWEALTHS AND GOOD GOVERNMENTS DO NOURISH VIRTUE GROWN BUT DO NOT MUCH MEND THE DEEDS BUT THE MISERY IS THAT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS ARE NOW APPLIED TO THE ENDS LEAST TO BE DESIRED
764-132280-0037 OF FORTUNE IT CANNOT BE DENIED BUT OUTWARD ACCIDENTS CONDUCE MUCH TO FORTUNE FAVOR OPPORTUNITY DEATH OF OTHERS OCCASION FITTING VIRTUE BUT CHIEFLY THE MOULD OF A MAN'S FORTUNE IS IN HIS OWN HANDS
764-132280-0038 COMEDERIT NON FIT DRACO OVERT AND APPARENT VIRTUES BRING FORTH PRAISE BUT THERE BE SECRET AND HIDDEN VIRTUES THAT BRING FORTH FORTUNE CERTAIN DELIVERIES OF A MAN'S SELF WHICH HAVE NO NAME
764-132280-0039 THE SPANISH NAME DESEMBOLTURA PARTLY EXPRESSETH THEM WHEN THERE BE NOT STONDS NOR RESTIVENESS IN A MAN'S NATURE BUT THAT THE WHEELS OF HIS MIND KEEP WAY WITH THE WHEELS OF HIS FORTUNE
764-132280-0040 FOR SO LIVY AFTER HE HAD DESCRIBED CATO MAJOR IN THESE WORDS
764-132280-0041 FALLETH UPON THAT THAT HE HAD VERSATILE INGENIUM THEREFORE IF A MAN LOOK SHARPLY AND ATTENTIVELY HE SHALL SEE FORTUNE FOR THOUGH SHE BE BLIND YET SHE IS NOT INVISIBLE
764-132280-0042 THE WAY OF FORTUNE IS LIKE THE MILKEN WAY IN THE SKY WHICH IS A MEETING OR KNOT OF A NUMBER OF SMALL STARS NOT SEEN ASUNDER BUT GIVING LIGHT TOGETHER
764-132280-0043 SO ARE THERE A NUMBER OF LITTLE AND SCARCE DISCERNED VIRTUES OR RATHER FACULTIES AND CUSTOMS THAT MAKE MEN FORTUNATE THE ITALIANS NOTE SOME OF THEM SUCH AS A MAN WOULD LITTLE THINK WHEN THEY SPEAK OF ONE THAT CANNOT DO AMISS
764-132280-0044 THEREFORE EXTREME LOVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY OR MASTERS WERE NEVER FORTUNATE NEITHER CAN THEY BE FOR WHEN A MAN PLACETH HIS THOUGHTS WITHOUT HIMSELF HE GOETH NOT HIS OWN WAY AN HASTY FORTUNE MAKETH AN ENTERPRISER AND REMOVER
764-132280-0045 THE FRENCH HATH IT BETTER ENTREPRENANT OR REMUANT BUT THE EXERCISED FORTUNE MAKETH THE ABLE MAN FORTUNE IS TO BE HONORED AND RESPECTED
764-132280-0046 AND IT BE BUT FOR HER DAUGHTERS CONFIDENCE AND REPUTATION FOR THOSE TWO FELICITY BREEDETH THE FIRST WITHIN A MAN'S SELF THE LATTER IN OTHERS TOWARDS HIM ALL WISE MEN TO DECLINE THE ENVY OF THEIR OWN VIRTUES
764-132280-0047 USE TO ASCRIBE THEM TO PROVIDENCE AND FORTUNE FOR SO THEY MAY THE BETTER ASSUME THEM AND BESIDES IT IS GREATNESS IN A MAN TO BE THE CARE OF THE HIGHER POWERS SO CAESAR SAID TO THE PILOT IN THE TEMPEST
764-132280-0048 PORTAS ET FORTUNAM EJUS SO SYLLA CHOSE THE NAME OF FELIX AND NOT OF MAGNUS AND IT HATH BEEN NOTED THAT THOSE WHO ASCRIBE OPENLY TOO MUCH TO THEIR OWN WISDOM AND POLICY
764-132280-0049 NEVER PROSPERED IN ANYTHING HE UNDERTOOK AFTERWARDS CERTAINLY THERE BE WHOSE FORTUNES ARE LIKE HOMER'S VERSES THAT HAVE A SLIDE AND EASINESS MORE THAN THE VERSES OF OTHER POETS
764-132280-0050 AS PLUTARCH SAITH OF TIMOLEON'S FORTUNE IN RESPECT OF THAT OF
