1289-288043-0000 WE SHALL PRESENT THESE TOGETHER WITH OUR REPLY AS THEY APPEARED ON THE SUNDAY PROGRAMS OF THE INDEPENDENT RELIGIOUS SOCIETY CRITICISM IS WELCOME IF THE CRITICISM IS JUST IT PREVENTS US FROM MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE
1289-288043-0001 THE HISTORICITY OF JESUS IS IN PRINT A FEW FURTHER REFLECTIONS ON SOME MINOR POINTS IN DOCTOR CRAPSEY'S ARGUMENT MAY ADD TO THE VALUE OF THE PUBLISHED COPY
1289-288043-0002 MANGASARIAN CRAPSEY DEBATE ANSWER THE ONLY WAY THIS QUESTION CAN BE SETTLED IS BY APPEALING TO HISTORY MITHRAISM IS A VARIANT RELIGION WHICH AT ONE TIME SPREAD OVER THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND CAME NEAR OUTCLASSING CHRISTIANITY
1289-288043-0003 LIKE BRAHMANISM JUDAISM SHINTO AND THE BABYLONIAN AND EGYPTIAN CULTS WHICH HAD NO SINGLE FOUNDERS CHRISTIANITY IS A DEPOSIT TO WHICH HELLENIC JUDAIC AND LATIN TENDENCIES HAVE EACH CONTRIBUTED ITS QUOTA
1289-288043-0004 BUT THE POPULAR IMAGINATION CRAVES A MAKER FOR THE UNIVERSE A FOUNDER FOR ROME A FIRST MAN FOR THE HUMAN RACE AND A GREAT CHIEF AS THE STARTER OF THE TRIBE IN THE SAME WAY IT FANCIES A DIVINE OR SEMI DIVINE BEING AS THE AUTHOR OF ITS CREDO
1289-288043-0005 WE WOULD BE IN THE SAME POSITION THAT THE ASTRONOMERS WERE WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THE GREAT PLANET URANUS FROM THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THESE BODIES THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT THESE PERTURBATIONS COULD BE OCCASIONED BY NOTHING LESS THAN A GREAT PLANET LYING OUTSIDE OF THE THEN VIEW OF MANKIND
1289-288043-0006 WE HAVE OF JESUS A VERY DISTINCTLY OUTLINED HISTORY THERE IS NOTHING VAGUE ABOUT HIM
1289-288043-0007 WE CAN FOLLOW JESUS HISTORY FROM THE TIME THAT HE ENTERED UPON HIS PUBLIC CAREER UNTIL THE TIME THAT CAREER CLOSED JUST AS EASILY AS WE CAN FOLLOW CAESAR ET CETERA
1289-288043-0008 ANSWER HOW LONG WAS THE TIME FROM THE OPENING OF JESUS PUBLIC CAREER UNTIL THE TIME THAT IT CLOSED ONE YEAR ACCORDING TO THE THREE GOSPELS IT SOUNDS QUITE A PERIOD TO SPEAK OF FOLLOWING HIS PUBLIC CAREER FROM BEGINNING TO END
1289-288043-0009 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE YEAR HIS WHOLE LIFE IS HID IN IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS WE KNOW NOTHING OF HIS CHILDHOOD NOTHING OF HIS OLD AGE IF HE LIVED TO BE OLD AND OF HIS YOUTH WE KNOW JUST ENOUGH TO FILL UP A YEAR
1289-288043-0010 THE CHRIST I ADMIT TO BE PURELY MYTHOLOGICAL THE WORD CHRIST YOU KNOW MEANS THE ANOINTED ONE THEY THE HEBREWS EXPECTED THE COMING OF THAT CHRIST BUT THAT IS PURELY A MYTHICAL TITLE
1289-288043-0011 ANSWER DID THE HEBREWS THEN EXPECT THE COMING OF A TITLE WERE THEY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE ANCIENT THRONE OF DAVID RESTORED BY A TITLE BY MESSIAH OR CHRIST THE JEWS DID NOT MEAN A NAME BUT A MAN A REAL FLESH AND BONE SAVIOR
1289-288043-0012 ANOINTED OR APPOINTED BY HEAVEN BUT IF THE CHRIST WHICH THE HEBREWS EXPECTED WAS PURELY MYTHICAL WHAT MAKES THE SAME CHRIST IN THE SUPPOSED TACITUS PASSAGE HISTORICAL
1289-288043-0013 THE NEW TESTAMENT JESUS IS JESUS CHRIST AND THE APOSTLE JOHN SPEAKS OF THOSE WHO CONFESS NOT THAT JESUS CHRIST IS COME IN THE FLESH MARK HIS WORDS NOT CHRIST BUT JESUS CHRIST THE APOSTLE DOES NOT SEPARATE THE TWO NAMES
1289-288043-0014 THERE WERE THOSE THEN IN THE EARLY CHURCH WHO DENIED THE HISTORICITY NOT OF A TITLE FOR WHAT MEANING WOULD THERE BE IN DENYING THAT A TITLE IS COME IN THE FLESH BUT OF A PERSON KNOWN AS JESUS CHRIST AND WHAT COULD THE DOCTOR MEAN WHEN HE SPEAKS OF A TITLE BEING MYTHOLOGICAL
1289-288043-0015 THERE ARE NO MYTHOLOGICAL TITLES TITLES ARE WORDS AND WE DO NOT SPEAK OF THE HISTORICITY OR THE NON HISTORICITY OF WORDS WE CANNOT SAY OF WORDS AS WE DO OF MEN THAT SOME ARE HISTORICAL AND OTHERS ARE MYTHICAL WILLIAM TELL IS A MYTH
1289-288043-0016 NOT THE NAME BUT THE MAN THE NAME STANDS FOR WILLIAM IS THE NAME OF MANY REAL PEOPLE AND SO IS TELL THERE WERE MANY ANOINTED KINGS WHO ARE HISTORICAL AND THE QUESTION IS IS JESUS CHRIST OR JESUS THE ANOINTED ALSO HISTORICAL
1289-288043-0017 TO ANSWER THAT JESUS IS HISTORICAL BUT THE ANOINTED IS NOT IS TO EVADE THE QUESTION WHEN MOSHEIM DECLARES THAT THE PREVALENT OPINION AMONG EARLY CHRISTIANS WAS THAT CHRIST EXISTED IN APPEARANCE ONLY
1289-288043-0018 THERE IS NO MEANING IN SAYING THAT A MAN'S TITLE EXISTED IN APPEARANCE ONLY WE DO NOT SPEAK OF A TITLE BEING BORN OR CRUCIFIED
1289-288043-0019 THEY HAD IN MIND NOT A TITLE BUT A PERSON IN CONCLUSION IF THE CHRIST BY WHOM THE HEBREWS MEANT NOT A MERE NAME BUT A MAN WAS PURELY MYTHOLOGICAL
1289-288043-0020 THE MINISTER OF THE SOUTH CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH WHO HEARD THE DEBATE HAS PUBLICLY CALLED YOUR LECTURER AN UNSCRUPULOUS SOPHIST WHO PRACTICES IMPOSITION UPON A POPULAR AUDIENCE
1289-288043-0021 AND WHO PUT FORTH SENTENCE AFTER SENTENCE WHICH EVERY SCHOLAR PRESENT KNEW TO BE A PERVERSION OF THE FACTS SO OUTRAGEOUS AS TO BE LAUGHABLE AS ONE OF THE LEADING MORNING PAPERS SAID THE ABOVE IS NOT A REPLY TO ARGUMENTS MADE BY MISTER MANGASARIAN
1289-288043-0022 OUR CRITIC IS NOT CAREFUL TO MAKE HIS STATEMENTS AGREE WITH THE FACT ONE INSTANCE HOWEVER HE IS ABLE TO REMEMBER WHICH WHEN IT FELL UPON MY EARS HE WRITES IT STRUCK ME WITH SUCH AMAZEMENT THAT IT COMPLETELY DROVE FROM MY MIND A SERIES OF MOST ASTONISHING STATEMENTS OF VARIOUS SORTS
1289-288043-0023 WHICH HAD JUST PRECEDED IT WE REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING ON THE EXCUSE GIVEN TO EXPLAIN SO SIGNIFICANT A FAILURE OF MEMORY THE INSTANCE REFERRED TO WAS ABOUT THE DENIAL OF SOME IN APOSTOLIC TIMES THAT JESUS CHRIST IS COME IN THE FLESH
1289-288043-0024 BUT AS MISTER MANGASARIAN HAD HARDLY SPOKEN MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES WHEN HE TOUCHED UPON THIS POINT IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN PRECEDED BY A SERIES OF MOST ASTONISHING STATEMENTS OF VARIOUS SORTS
1289-288043-0025 AND WHAT WAS THE STATEMENT WHICH WHILE IT CRIPPLED HIS MEMORY IT DID NOT MODERATE HIS ZEAL WE WILL LET HIM PRESENT IT HIMSELF I REFER TO THE USE HE MADE OF ONE OR TWO PASSAGES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT MENTIONING SOME WHO DENY THAT JESUS CHRIST IS COME IN THE FLESH
1289-288043-0026 SO THAT HE WENT ON TO SAY THERE WERE THOSE EVEN AMONG THE EARLY CHRISTIANS THEMSELVES WHO DENIED THAT JESUS HAD COME IN THE FLESH OF COURSE THEY WERE CAST OUT AS HERETICS HERE CAME AN IMPRESSIVE PAUSE AND THEN WITHOUT FURTHER EXPLANATION OR QUALIFICATION HE PROCEEDED TO SOMETHING ELSE
1289-288043-0027 DOES IT JUSTIFY HASTY LANGUAGE SAINT JOHN WRITES OF THOSE WHO CONFESSED NOT THAT JESUS CHRIST IS COME IN THE FLESH THE NATURAL MEANING OF THE WORDS IS THAT EVEN IN APOSTOLIC TIMES SOME DENIED THE FLESH AND BONE JESUS
1289-288043-0028 AND REGARDED HIM AS AN IDEA OR AN APPARITION SOMETHING LIKE THE HOLY GHOST
1289-288043-0029 TO US MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING PRESENTED ON THIS SUBJECT IS THIS EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A VERY EARLY DISPUTE AMONG THE FIRST DISCIPLES OF JESUS ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HE WAS REAL OR MERELY AN APPARITION
1289-288043-0030 THE APOSTLE JOHN IN HIS EPISTLE CLEARLY STATES THAT EVEN AMONG THE FAITHFUL THERE WERE THOSE WHO CONFESS NOT THAT JESUS CHRIST IS COME IN THE FLESH THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AS EARLY AS JOHN'S TIME IF HE IS THE WRITER OF THE EPISTLE JESUS HISTORICITY WAS QUESTIONED
1289-288043-0031 THE GOSPEL OF JOHN ALSO HINTS AT THE EXISTENCE IN THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH OF CHRISTIANS WHO DID NOT ACCEPT THE REALITY OF JESUS WHEN DOUBTING THOMAS IS TOLD OF THE RESURRECTION HE ANSWERS THAT HE MUST FEEL THE PRINTS OF THE NAILS WITH HIS FINGERS BEFORE HE WILL BELIEVE
1289-288043-0032 AND JESUS NOT ONLY GRANTS THE WISHES OF THIS SKEPTICAL APOSTLE BUT HE ALSO EATS IN THE PRESENCE OF THEM ALL WHICH STORY IS TOLD EVIDENTLY TO SILENCE THE CRITICS WHO MAINTAINED THAT JESUS WAS ONLY A SPIRIT THE WISDOM OF GOD AN EMANATION A LIGHT AND NOT REAL FLESH AND BONES
1289-288043-0033 THE SAME CLERGYMAN TO WHOM A COPY OF THE MANGASARIAN CRAPSEY DEBATE WAS SENT HAS WRITTEN A FIVE PAGE CRITICISM OF IT THE STRENGTH OF A GIVEN CRITICISM IS DETERMINED BY ASKING
1289-288043-0034 DOES IT IN ANY WAY IMPAIR THE SOUNDNESS OF THE ARGUMENT AGAINST WHICH IT IS DIRECTED CRITICS HAVE DISCOVERED MISTAKES IN DARWIN AND HAECKEL BUT ARE THESE MISTAKES OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO PROVE FATAL TO THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION
1289-288043-0035 TO BE EFFECTIVE CRITICISM MUST BE AIMED AT THE HEART OF AN ARGUMENT A MAN'S LIFE IS NOT IN HIS HAT WHICH COULD BE KNOCKED OFF OR IN HIS CLOTHES WHICH COULD BE TORN IN PLACES BY HIS ASSAILANT WITHOUT IN THE LEAST WEAKENING HIS OPPONENT'S POSITION
1289-288043-0036 DOES NOT AT ALL DISPROVE THE FACT THAT ACCORDING TO THE CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES THEMSELVES AMONG THE APOSTOLIC FOLLOWERS THERE WERE THOSE TO WHOM JESUS CHRIST WAS ONLY A PHANTOM MILMAN THE CHRISTIAN HISTORIAN
1289-288043-0037 STATES THAT THE BELIEF ABOUT JESUS CHRIST ADOPTED BY ALMOST ALL THE GNOSTIC SECTS WAS THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS BUT AN APPARENT HUMAN BEING AN IMPASSIVE PHANTOM
1289-288043-0038 WAS EVER SUCH A VIEW ENTERTAINED OF CAESAR SOCRATES OR OF ANY OTHER HISTORICAL CHARACTER ON PAGE TWENTY EIGHT OF THE DEBATE WE SAY THE APOSTLE JOHN COMPLAINS OF THOSE WHO CONFESS NOT THAT JESUS CHRIST IS COME IN THE FLESH
1289-288043-0039 TO THIS THE CLERGYMAN REPLIES THE APOSTLE JOHN NEVER MADE ANY SUCH COMPLAINT CRITICAL SCHOLARSHIP IS PRETTY WELL AGREED THAT HE DID NOT WRITE THE EPISTLES ASCRIBED TO HIM WE HAVE A LECTURE ON HOW THE BIBLE WAS INVENTED
1289-288043-0040 JOHN DID NOT WRITE THE EPISTLES THEN WHICH THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS AND AT A COST OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND AT THE GREATER SACRIFICE OF TRUTH AND PROGRESS HAS BEEN PROCLAIMING TO THE WORLD AS THE WORK OF THE INSPIRED JOHN
1289-288043-0041 THE STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO GET AROUND THIS TERRIBLE TEXT IN THE HOLY BIBLE
1289-288043-0042 OUR DESIRE IN ENGAGING IN THIS ARGUMENT IS TO TURN THE THOUGHT AND LOVE OF THE WORLD FROM A MYTHICAL BEING TO HUMANITY WHICH IS BOTH REAL AND PRESENT ON PAGE TWENTY TWO OF THE DEBATE WE SAY
1289-288043-0043 SAINT PAUL TELLS US THAT HE LIVED IN JERUSALEM AT A TIME WHEN JESUS MUST HAVE BEEN HOLDING THE ATTENTION OF THE CITY YET HE NEVER MET HIM TO THIS THE CLERGYMAN REPLIES PAUL TELLS US NOTHING OF THE KIND IN A SPEECH WHICH IS PUT INTO THE MOUTH OF PAUL
1289-288043-0044 PUT INTO THE MOUTH OF PAUL IS THIS ANOTHER INSTANCE OF FORGERY JOHN DID NOT WRITE THE EPISTLES AND PAUL'S SPEECH IN THE BOOK OF ACTS WAS PUT INTO HIS MOUTH
1289-288043-0045 WE ARE BLAMED FOR NOT KNOWING BETTER THAN TO PROVE ANYTHING BY QUOTING PAUL AND JOHN AS IF EVERYTHING THEY SAID WAS TRUSTWORTHY IN OTHER WORDS ONLY THOSE PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE ARE AUTHENTIC WHICH THE CLERGY QUOTE THOSE WHICH THE RATIONALISTS QUOTE ARE SPURIOUS
1289-288043-0046 IN THE MEANTIME THE AUTHENTIC AS WELL AS THE SPURIOUS PASSAGES TOGETHER COMPOSE THE CHURCHES WORD OF GOD
1289-288043-0047 WAS IT RIGHT FOR YOU TO ASSUME THAT I WAS CORRECTLY REPORTED BY THE NEWS AFTER STATING WHAT HE HAD SAID IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE REPORTER THE RABBI CONTINUES BUT SAID I TO THE REPORTER ALL THESE POSSIBLE ALLUSIONS DO NOT PROVE THAT JESUS EXISTED
1289-288043-0048 YOU SEE IN REALITY I AGREED WITH YOU I PERSONALLY BELIEVE JESUS LIVED BUT I HAVE NO PROOF FOR THIS BEYOND MY FEELING THAT THE MOVEMENT WITH WHICH THE NAME IS ASSOCIATED COULD EVEN FOR PAUL NOT HAVE TAKEN ITS NOMENCLATURE WITHOUT A PERSONAL SUBSTRATUM
1289-288043-0049 BUT AND THIS I TOLD THE REPORTER ALSO THIS DOES NOT PROVE THAT THE JESUS OF THE GOSPELS IS HISTORICAL RABBI HIRSCH WRITES IN THIS SAME LETTER THAT HE DID NOT SAY JESUS WAS MENTIONED IN THE RABBINICAL BOOKS THE NEWS REPORTS THE RABBI AS SAYING
1289-288043-0050 AS THE REPORT IN THE NEWS WAS ALLOWED TO STAND FOR FOUR DAYS WITHOUT CORRECTION AND AS RABBI HIRSCH DID NOT EVEN PRIVATELY BY LETTER OR BY PHONE DISCLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ARTICLE TO MISTER MANGASARIAN
1289-288043-0051 THE LATTER CLAIMS HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN ASSUMING THAT THE PUBLISHED REPORT WAS RELIABLE BUT IT IS WITH PLEASURE THAT THE INDEPENDENT RELIGIOUS SOCIETY GIVES RABBI HIRSCH THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN HIS POSITION
1289-288043-0052 WE HOPE HE WILL ALSO LET US KNOW WHETHER HE SAID TO THE REPORTER I DO NOT BELIEVE IN MISTER MANGASARIAN'S ARGUMENT THAT CHRISTIANITY HAS INSPIRED MASSACRES WARS AND INQUISITIONS IT IS A STOCK ARGUMENT AND NOT TO THE POINT THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY
1289-288043-0053 AND AS THE RABBI DOES NOT QUESTION THE STATEMENT WE INFER THAT IT IS A CORRECT REPORT OF WHAT HE SAID
1289-288043-0054 AND THOU SHALT CONSUME ALL THE PEOPLE WHICH THE LORD THY GOD SHALL DELIVER THEE THINE EYE SHALL HAVE NO PITY UPON THEM
