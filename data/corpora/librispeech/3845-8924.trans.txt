3845-8924-0000 GRACE HEARD THEM AND GUESSED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT THIS VISITATION UPON HERSELF ONE DAY WHILE SHE STILL LAY THERE WITH HER HEAD THROBBING WONDERING IF SHE WERE REALLY GOING TO JOIN HIM WHO HAD GONE BEFORE GRAMMER OLIVER CAME TO HER BEDSIDE
3845-8924-0001 IT WAS LEFT BY MARTY I THINK WHEN SHE CAME THIS MORNING GRACE TURNED HER HOT EYES UPON WHAT GRAMMER HELD UP
3845-8924-0002 IF SHE WISHED TO PRESERVE HERSELF FROM FALLING A VICTIM TO THE MALADY WHICH HAD PULLED DOWN WINTERBORNE SHE EXAMINED IT AS WELL AS SHE COULD
3845-8924-0003 HUE AND BORE A LABEL WITH AN INSCRIPTION IN ITALIAN HE HAD PROBABLY GOT IT IN HIS WANDERINGS ABROAD SHE KNEW BUT LITTLE ITALIAN BUT COULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE CORDIAL WAS A FEBRIFUGE OF SOME SORT
3845-8924-0004 HER FATHER HER MOTHER AND ALL THE HOUSEHOLD WERE ANXIOUS FOR HER RECOVERY AND SHE RESOLVED TO OBEY HER HUSBAND'S DIRECTIONS WHATEVER THE RISK IF ANY SHE WAS PREPARED TO RUN IT A GLASS OF WATER WAS BROUGHT AND THE DROPS DROPPED IN
3845-8924-0005 THE EFFECT THOUGH NOT MIRACULOUS WAS REMARKABLE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR SHE FELT CALMER COOLER BETTER ABLE TO REFLECT LESS INCLINED TO FRET AND CHAFE AND WEAR HERSELF AWAY SHE TOOK A FEW DROPS MORE
3845-8924-0006 FROM THAT TIME THE FEVER RETREATED AND WENT OUT LIKE A DAMPED CONFLAGRATION HOW CLEVER HE IS SHE SAID REGRETFULLY
3845-8924-0007 SO AS TO TURN HIS GREAT TALENTS TO GOOD ACCOUNT PERHAPS HE HAS SAVED MY USELESS LIFE BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW IT AND DOESN'T CARE WHETHER HE HAS SAVED IT OR NOT AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WILL NEVER BE TOLD BY ME
3845-8924-0008 PROBABLY HE ONLY GAVE IT TO ME IN THE ARROGANCE OF HIS SKILL TO SHOW THE GREATNESS OF HIS RESOURCES BESIDE MINE AS ELIJAH DREW DOWN FIRE FROM HEAVEN
3845-8924-0009 FROM THIS FOILED ATTACK UPON HER LIFE GRACE WENT TO MARTY SOUTH'S COTTAGE THE CURRENT OF HER BEING HAD AGAIN SET TOWARDS THE LOST GILES WINTERBORNE MARTY SHE SAID WE BOTH LOVED HIM WE WILL GO TO HIS GRAVE TOGETHER
3845-8924-0010 EVEN IF SHE HAD NOT TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIS HOUSE SOMETIMES SHE SUCCEEDED IN HER ATTEMPT SOMETIMES SHE DID NOT THEY STOOD BY THE GRAVE TOGETHER AND THOUGH THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN
3845-8924-0011 HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DESCEND EVERY YEAR WITH HIS PORTABLE MILL AND PRESS
3845-8924-0012 PERHAPS GRACE'S FIRST GRIEF THE DISCOVERY THAT IF HE HAD LIVED HE COULD NEVER HAVE CLAIMED HER HAD SOME POWER IN SOFTENING THIS THE SECOND ON MARTY'S PART THERE WAS THE SAME CONSIDERATION NEVER WOULD SHE HAVE BEEN HIS
3845-8924-0013 AS NO ANTICIPATION OF GRATIFIED AFFECTION HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE WHILE HE WAS WITH THEM
3845-8924-0014 GRACE WAS ABASED WHEN BY DEGREES SHE FOUND THAT SHE HAD NEVER UNDERSTOOD GILES AS MARTY HAD DONE MARTY SOUTH ALONE OF ALL THE WOMEN IN HINTOCK
3845-8924-0015 AND THE WORLD HAD APPROXIMATED TO WINTERBORNE'S LEVEL OF INTELLIGENT INTERCOURSE WITH NATURE IN THAT RESPECT SHE HAD FORMED THE COMPLEMENT TO HIM IN THE OTHER SEX HAD LIVED AS HIS COUNTERPART HAD SUBJOINED HER THOUGHT TO HIS AS A COROLLARY
3845-8924-0016 THE CASUAL GLIMPSES WHICH THE ORDINARY POPULATION BESTOWED UPON THAT WONDROUS WORLD OF SAP AND LEAVES CALLED THE HINTOCK WOODS HAD BEEN WITH THESE TWO GILES AND MARTY A CLEAR GAZE THEY HAD BEEN POSSESSED OF ITS FINER MYSTERIES
3845-8924-0017 AS OF COMMONPLACE KNOWLEDGE HAD BEEN ABLE TO READ ITS HIEROGLYPHS AS ORDINARY WRITING TO THEM THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF NIGHT WINTER WIND STORM AMID THOSE DENSE BOUGHS WHICH HAD TO GRACE A TOUCH OF THE UNCANNY AND EVEN THE SUPERNATURAL
3845-8924-0018 WERE SIMPLE OCCURRENCES WHOSE ORIGIN CONTINUANCE AND LAWS THEY FOREKNEW THEY HAD PLANTED TOGETHER AND TOGETHER THEY HAD FELLED TOGETHER THEY HAD WITH THE RUN OF THE YEARS MENTALLY COLLECTED THOSE REMOTER SIGNS AND SYMBOLS
3845-8924-0019 WHICH SEEN IN FEW WERE OF RUNIC OBSCURITY BUT ALL TOGETHER MADE AN ALPHABET
3845-8924-0020 THEY COULD PRONOUNCE UPON THE SPECIES OF THE TREE WHENCE THEY STRETCHED FROM THE QUALITY OF THE WIND'S MURMUR THROUGH A BOUGH THEY COULD IN LIKE MANNER NAME ITS SORT AFAR OFF THEY KNEW BY A GLANCE AT A TRUNK IF ITS HEART WERE SOUND
3845-8924-0021 OR TAINTED WITH INCIPIENT DECAY AND BY THE STATE OF ITS UPPER TWIGS THE STRATUM THAT HAD BEEN REACHED BY ITS ROOTS THE ARTIFICES OF THE SEASONS WERE SEEN BY THEM FROM THE CONJUROR'S OWN POINT OF VIEW AND NOT FROM THAT OF THE SPECTATOR'S
3845-8924-0022 NOR I TO HIM YET YOU AND HE COULD SPEAK IN A TONGUE THAT NOBODY ELSE KNEW NOT EVEN MY FATHER THOUGH HE CAME NEAREST KNOWING
3845-8924-0023 SHE COULD INDULGE IN MOURNFUL FANCIES LIKE THIS TO MARTY
3845-8924-0024 WHICH MARTY'S HAD NOT REMAINED
3845-8924-0025 IT WOULD HAVE DRIVEN HER WELL NIGH TO INSANITY BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS THAT BARE POSSIBILITY THAT HIS EXPOSURE HAD ONLY PRECIPITATED WHAT WAS INEVITABLE SHE LONGED TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAD NOT DONE EVEN THIS
3845-8924-0026 HER HUSBAND WAS THAT MAN YET TO ASK HIM IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DETAIL THE TRUE CONDITIONS IN WHICH SHE AND WINTERBORNE HAD LIVED DURING THESE THREE OR FOUR CRITICAL DAYS THAT FOLLOWED HER FLIGHT
3845-8924-0027 SHE NEVER DOUBTED THAT FITZPIERS WOULD BELIEVE HER IF SHE MADE A CLEAN CONFESSION OF THE ACTUAL SITUATION BUT TO VOLUNTEER THE CORRECTION WOULD SEEM LIKE SIGNALLING FOR A TRUCE AND THAT
3845-8924-0028 WAS WHAT SHE DID NOT FEEL THE NEED OF IT WILL PROBABLY NOT APPEAR A SURPRISING STATEMENT
3845-8924-0029 THAT THE MAN WHOM GRACE'S FIDELITY COULD NOT KEEP FAITHFUL WAS STUNG INTO PASSIONATE THROBS OF INTEREST CONCERNING HER BY HER AVOWAL OF THE CONTRARY
3845-8924-0030 HE PASSED A MONTH OR TWO OF GREAT MISERY AT EXBURY THE PLACE TO WHICH HE HAD RETIRED QUITE AS MUCH MISERY INDEED AS GRACE
3845-8924-0031 HIS WIDE EXPERIENCE OF THE SEX HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT IN MANY CASES WOMEN WHO VENTURED ON HAZARDOUS MATTERS DID SO BECAUSE THEY LACKED AN IMAGINATION SENSUOUS ENOUGH TO FEEL THEIR FULL FORCE
3845-8924-0032 IN THIS LIGHT GRACE'S BOLD AVOWAL MIGHT MERELY HAVE DENOTED THE DESPERATION OF ONE WHO WAS A CHILD TO THE REALITIES OF OBLIQUITY FITZPIERS'S MENTAL SUFFERINGS
3845-8924-0033 AND HERE HE HOVERED FOR HOURS AROUND THE SCENE OF THE PUREST EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES THAT HE HAD EVER KNOWN IN HIS LIFE HE WALKED ABOUT THE WOODS THAT SURROUNDED MELBURY'S HOUSE
3845-8924-0034 IT WAS A FINE EVENING AND ON HIS WAY HOMEWARD HE PASSED NEAR MARTY SOUTH'S COTTAGE AS USUAL SHE HAD LIGHTED HER CANDLE WITHOUT CLOSING HER SHUTTERS HE SAW HER WITHIN AS HE HAD SEEN HER MANY TIMES BEFORE
3845-8924-0035 SHE WAS POLISHING TOOLS AND THOUGH HE HAD NOT WISHED TO SHOW HIMSELF HE COULD NOT RESIST SPEAKING IN TO HER THROUGH THE HALF OPEN DOOR WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT FOR MARTY
3845-8924-0036 HE COULD SEE INDEED THAT THEY WERE NOT HERS FOR ONE WAS A SPADE LARGE AND HEAVY AND ANOTHER WAS A BILL HOOK WHICH SHE COULD ONLY HAVE USED WITH BOTH HANDS THE SPADE
3845-8924-0037 FITZPIERS SOMEHOW DIVINED THAT THEY WERE GILES WINTERBORNE'S AND HE PUT THE QUESTION TO HER SHE REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE I AM GOING TO KEEP EM SHE SAID BUT I CAN'T GET HIS APPLE MILL AND PRESS
3845-8924-0038 IT IS GOING TO BE SOLD THEY SAY THEN I WILL BUY IT FOR YOU SAID FITZPIERS THAT WILL BE MAKING YOU A RETURN FOR A KINDNESS YOU DID ME HIS GLANCE FELL UPON THE GIRL'S RARE COLORED HAIR WHICH HAD GROWN AGAIN OH MARTY
3845-8924-0039 THOSE LOCKS OF YOURS AND THAT LETTER BUT IT WAS A KINDNESS TO SEND IT NEVERTHELESS
3845-8924-0040 SHE WOULD TRAVEL WITH IT IN THE AUTUMN SEASON AS HE HAD DONE SHE SAID SHE WOULD BE QUITE STRONG ENOUGH WITH OLD CREEDLE AS AN ASSISTANT AH THERE WAS ONE NEARER TO HIM THAN YOU SAID FITZPIERS REFERRING TO WINTERBORNE ONE WHO LIVED WHERE HE LIVED
3845-8924-0041 AND WAS WITH HIM WHEN HE DIED THEN MARTY SUSPECTING THAT HE DID NOT KNOW THE TRUE CIRCUMSTANCES FROM THE FACT THAT MISSUS FITZPIERS AND HIMSELF WERE LIVING APART
3845-8924-0042 OF HIS OWN LIFE WHEN THE SURGEON HEARD IT HE ALMOST ENVIED GILES HIS CHIVALROUS CHARACTER HE EXPRESSED A WISH TO MARTY THAT HIS VISIT TO HER SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET AND WENT HOME THOUGHTFUL
