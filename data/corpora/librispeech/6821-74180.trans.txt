6821-74180-0000 AND THIS INCONVENIENCE IS SO MUCH PERCEIVED BY THE EYE THAT A DOOR VALVE WITH A POINTED HEAD IS ALWAYS A DISAGREEABLE OBJECT IT BECOMES THEREFORE A MATTER OF TRUE NECESSITY
6821-74180-0001 WE SUPPOSED THE JAMB OF THE DOOR TO BE OF THE UTMOST HEIGHT REQUIRED FOR ENTRANCE THE EXTRA HEIGHT OF THE ARCH IS UNNECESSARY AS AN OPENING THE ARCH BEING REQUIRED FOR ITS STRENGTH ONLY NOT FOR ITS ELEVATION
6821-74180-0002 INTO WHICH THE VALVES MAY BE FITTED AND THE TRIANGULAR OR SEMICIRCULAR ARCHED SPACE ABOVE THE LINTEL MAY THEN BE PERMANENTLY CLOSED
6821-74180-0003 OUR OBJECT SHOULD BE TO CONNECT THE WINDOW BARS AMONG THEMSELVES SO FRAMING THEM TOGETHER THAT THEY MAY GIVE THE UTMOST POSSIBLE DEGREE OF SUPPORT
6821-74180-0004 BUT WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS ALREADY OUR WINDOW BARS ARE NOTHING BUT SMALL SHAFTS CAPITAL THEM THROW SMALL ARCHES ACROSS BETWEEN THE SMALLER BARS LARGE ARCHES OVER THEM BETWEEN THE LARGER BARS
6821-74180-0005 ONE COMPREHENSIVE ARCH OVER THE WHOLE OR ELSE A HORIZONTAL LINTEL IF THE WINDOW HAVE A FLAT HEAD AND WE HAVE A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF MUTUAL SUPPORT INDEPENDENT OF THE APERTURE HEAD
6821-74180-0006 THEREFORE A SMALL CIRCLE LIKE THE AXLE OF A WHEEL IS PUT INTO THE CENTRE OF THE WINDOW LARGE ENOUGH TO GIVE FOOTING TO THE NECESSARY NUMBER OF RADIATING BARS AND THE BARS ARE ARRANGED AS SPOKES BEING ALL OF COURSE
6821-74180-0007 PROPERLY CAPITALED AND ARCH HEADED
6821-74180-0008 WHICH IT IS THE OBJECT TO FILL WITH GLASS DIMINISHING THE POWER OF THE LIGHT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE BUT THERE ARE MANY CASES AS IN TRIFORIUM AND CLOISTER LIGHTS IN WHICH GLAZING IS NOT REQUIRED IN WHICH
6821-74180-0009 THEREFORE THE BARS IF THERE BE ANY MUST HAVE SOME MORE IMPORTANT FUNCTION THAN THAT OF MERELY HOLDING GLASS AND IN WHICH THEIR ACTUAL USE IS TO GIVE STEADINESS AND TONE AS IT WERE TO THE ARCHES AND WALLS ABOVE AND BESIDE THEM
6821-74180-0010 THE TRIFORIUM AND OF SECLUSION TO THOSE WHO WALK IN THE CLOISTER
6821-74180-0011 WILL BE FOUND RESOLVABLE
6821-74180-0012 WITH THE ARCHES IN PAIRS OR IN TRIPLE
6821-74180-0013 AND WITH SMALL ROSETTES PIERCED ABOVE THEM FOR LIGHT ALL THIS IS JUST AS RIGHT IN ITS PLACE AS THE GLASS TRACERY IS IN ITS OWN FUNCTION AND OFTEN MUCH MORE GRAND BUT THE SAME INDULGENCE IS NOT TO BE SHOWN
6821-74180-0014 TO THE AFFECTATIONS WHICH SUCCEEDED THE DEVELOPED FORMS OF THESE THERE ARE THREE PRINCIPAL CONDITIONS THE FLAMBOYANT OF FRANCE THE STUMP TRACERY OF GERMANY AND THE PERPENDICULAR
6821-74180-0015 REQUIRE THE SHAFTS OF THESE TRACERIES TO BECOME THE MAIN VERTICAL SUPPORTS OF THE FLOORS AND WALLS THEIR THICKNESS IS THEREFORE ENORMOUS AND YET
6821-74180-0016 INTO BALCONIES WHICH IS OBTAINED BY DOORS IN THEIR LATTICE GLAZING TO PREVENT THE INCONVENIENCE AND UGLINESS OF DRIVING THE HINGES AND FASTENINGS OF THEM INTO THE SHAFTS AND HAVING THE PLAY OF THE DOORS IN THE INTERVALS
