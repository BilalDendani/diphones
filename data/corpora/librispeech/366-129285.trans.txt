366-129285-0000 CHAPTER TWO TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH EDUCATION AND BOARD FOR THE NEXT EIGHT OR TEN MONTHS OLIVER WAS THE VICTIM OF A SYSTEMATIC COURSE OF TREACHERY AND DECEPTION
366-129285-0001 HE WAS BROUGHT UP BY HAND THE HUNGRY AND DESTITUTE SITUATION OF THE INFANT ORPHAN WAS DULY REPORTED BY THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES TO THE PARISH AUTHORITIES THE PARISH AUTHORITIES INQUIRED WITH DIGNITY OF THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES
366-129285-0002 WHETHER THERE WAS NO FEMALE THEN DOMICILED IN THE HOUSE WHO WAS IN A SITUATION TO IMPART TO OLIVER TWIST THE CONSOLATION AND NOURISHMENT OF WHICH HE STOOD IN NEED THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES REPLIED WITH HUMILITY THAT THERE WAS NOT
366-129285-0003 UPON THIS THE PARISH AUTHORITIES MAGNANIMOUSLY AND HUMANELY RESOLVED THAT OLIVER SHOULD BE FARMED OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT HE SHOULD BE DISPATCHED TO A BRANCH WORKHOUSE SOME THREE MILES OFF
366-129285-0004 WHERE TWENTY OR THIRTY OTHER JUVENILE OFFENDERS AGAINST THE POOR LAWS ROLLED ABOUT THE FLOOR ALL DAY WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF TOO MUCH FOOD OR TOO MUCH CLOTHING UNDER THE PARENTAL SUPERINTENDENCE OF AN ELDERLY FEMALE
366-129285-0005 QUITE ENOUGH TO OVERLOAD ITS STOMACH AND MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLE THE ELDERLY FEMALE WAS A WOMAN OF WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND SHE HAD A VERY ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HERSELF
366-129285-0006 SO SHE APPROPRIATED THE GREATER PART OF THE WEEKLY STIPEND TO HER OWN USE AND CONSIGNED THE RISING PAROCHIAL GENERATION TO EVEN A SHORTER ALLOWANCE THAN WAS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED FOR THEM THEREBY FINDING IN THE LOWEST DEPTH A DEEPER STILL
366-129285-0007 AND PROVING HERSELF A VERY GREAT EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHER EVERYBODY KNOWS THE STORY OF ANOTHER EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHER WHO HAD A GREAT THEORY ABOUT A HORSE BEING ABLE TO LIVE WITHOUT EATING AND WHO DEMONSTRATED IT SO WELL
366-129285-0008 THAT HE HAD GOT HIS OWN HORSE DOWN TO A STRAW A DAY AND WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE RENDERED HIM A VERY SPIRITED AND RAMPACIOUS ANIMAL ON NOTHING AT ALL IF HE HAD NOT DIED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS BEFORE HE WAS TO HAVE HAD HIS FIRST COMFORTABLE BAIT OF AIR
366-129285-0009 UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY OF THE FEMALE TO WHOSE PROTECTING CARE OLIVER TWIST WAS DELIVERED OVER A SIMILAR RESULT USUALLY ATTENDED THE OPERATION OF HER SYSTEM
366-129285-0010 FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE CHILD HAD CONTRIVED TO EXIST UPON THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE PORTION OF THE WEAKEST POSSIBLE FOOD IT DID PERVERSELY HAPPEN IN EIGHT AND A HALF CASES OUT OF TEN EITHER THAT IT SICKENED FROM WANT AND COLD OR FELL INTO THE FIRE FROM NEGLECT
366-129285-0011 OR GOT HALF SMOTHERED BY ACCIDENT IN ANY ONE OF WHICH CASES THE MISERABLE LITTLE BEING WAS USUALLY SUMMONED INTO ANOTHER WORLD AND THERE GATHERED TO THE FATHERS IT HAD NEVER KNOWN IN THIS OCCASIONALLY
366-129285-0012 WHEN THERE WAS SOME MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING INQUEST UPON A PARISH CHILD WHO HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED IN TURNING UP A BEDSTEAD OR INADVERTENTLY SCALDED TO DEATH WHEN THERE HAPPENED TO BE A WASHING THOUGH THE LATTER ACCIDENT WAS VERY SCARCE ANYTHING APPROACHING TO A WASHING BEING OF RARE OCCURRENCE IN THE FARM
366-129285-0013 THE FORMER OF WHOM HAD ALWAYS OPENED THE BODY AND FOUND NOTHING INSIDE WHICH WAS VERY PROBABLE INDEED AND THE LATTER OF WHOM INVARIABLY SWORE WHATEVER THE PARISH WANTED WHICH WAS VERY SELF DEVOTIONAL BESIDES THE BOARD MADE PERIODICAL PILGRIMAGES TO THE FARM
366-129285-0014 AND ALWAYS SENT THE BEADLE THE DAY BEFORE TO SAY THEY WERE GOING THE CHILDREN WERE NEAT AND CLEAN TO BEHOLD WHEN THEY WENT AND WHAT MORE WOULD THE PEOPLE HAVE IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT THIS SYSTEM OF FARMING WOULD PRODUCE ANY VERY EXTRAORDINARY OR LUXURIANT CROP
366-129285-0015 OLIVER TWIST'S NINTH BIRTHDAY FOUND HIM A PALE THIN CHILD SOMEWHAT DIMINUTIVE IN STATURE AND DECIDEDLY SMALL IN CIRCUMFERENCE BUT NATURE OR INHERITANCE HAD IMPLANTED A GOOD STURDY SPIRIT IN OLIVER'S BREAST IT HAD HAD PLENTY OF ROOM TO EXPAND
366-129285-0016 THANKS TO THE SPARE DIET OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND PERHAPS TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MAY BE ATTRIBUTED HIS HAVING ANY NINTH BIRTH DAY AT ALL BE THIS AS IT MAY HOWEVER IT WAS HIS NINTH BIRTHDAY AND HE WAS KEEPING IT IN THE COAL CELLAR WITH A SELECT PARTY OF TWO OTHER YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO
