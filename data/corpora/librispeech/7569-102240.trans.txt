7569-102240-0000 AND AS HIS VIGILS WERE APT TO BE PROLONGED HE FURNISHED A BEDROOM ADJOINING THE OFFICE WHERE LINCOLN OFTEN PASSED THE NIGHT WITH HIM MISTER HAY GIVES THIS ACCOUNT OF THE PRACTICE OF THE LAW IN THOSE DAYS
7569-102240-0001 IN FORMING OUR IDEAS OF LINCOLN'S GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT AS A LAWYER WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS LITIGATION WAS VERY SIMPLE AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF MODERN TIMES POPULATION WAS SPARSE AND SOCIETY SCARCELY ORGANIZED
7569-102240-0002 LAND WAS PLENTIFUL AND EMPLOYMENT ABUNDANT THERE WAS AN UTTER ABSENCE OF THE ABSTRUSE QUESTIONS AND COMPLICATIONS WHICH NOW BESET THE LAW
7569-102240-0003 THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT CLOSE AND SEARCHING STUDY INTO PRINCIPLES AND PRECEDENTS WHICH KEEPS THE MODERN LAW STUDENT BURIED IN HIS OFFICE ON THE CONTRARY THE VERY CHARACTER OF THIS SIMPLE LITIGATION DREW THE LAWYER INTO THE STREET AND NEIGHBORHOOD
7569-102240-0004 A MAN WOULD FOR HIS CONVENIENCE LAY DOWN AN IRASCIBLE NEIGHBOR'S FENCE AND INDOLENTLY FORGET TO PUT IT UP AGAIN AND AN ACTION OF TRESPASS WOULD GROW OUT OF IT THE SUIT WOULD LEAD TO A FREE FIGHT AND SOMETIMES FURNISH THE BLOODY INCIDENTS FOR A MURDER TRIAL
7569-102240-0005 EAGERLY DISCUSSING A CURRENT POLITICAL TOPIC NOT AS A QUESTION OF NEWS FOR NEWS WAS NOT THEN RECEIVED QUICKLY OR FREQUENTLY AS IT IS NOW BUT RATHER FOR THE SAKE OF DEBATE AND THE MEN FROM THE COUNTRY THE PIONEERS AND FARMERS
7569-102240-0006 MISTER HAY SAYS SPEAKING OF THE YOUTHS WHO MADE THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE THEIR PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS
7569-102240-0007 IT WAS ALWAYS A GREAT TREAT WHEN LINCOLN GOT AMONGST US WE WERE SURE TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE STORIES FOR WHICH HE ALREADY HAD A REPUTATION AND THERE WAS THIS PECULIARITY ABOUT THEM THAT THEY WERE NOT ONLY ENTERTAINING IN THEMSELVES
7569-102240-0008 AFTER MISTER HAY ENTERED HIS OFFICE
7569-102240-0009 THE COURSE OF THEIR LABORS WAS OFTEN BROKEN BY THE OLDER MAN'S WISE AND WITTY DIGRESSIONS ONCE AN INTERRUPTION OCCURRED WHICH AFFORDS AN ODD ILLUSTRATION OF THE CHARACTER OF DISCUSSION THEN PREVALENT
7569-102240-0010 NO MATTER TO WHICH PARTY THE SPEAKER BELONGED
7569-102240-0011 JUST UNDER OUR OFFICE AND THROUGH A TRAP DOOR MADE THERE WHEN THE BUILDING WAS USED FOR A STORE HOUSE WE COULD HEAR EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID IN THE HALL BELOW ONE NIGHT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION IN WHICH E D BAKER TOOK PART HE WAS A FIERY FELLOW
7569-102240-0012 AND WHEN HIS IMPULSIVENESS WAS LET LOOSE AMONG THE ROUGH ELEMENT THAT COMPOSED HIS AUDIENCE THERE WAS A FAIR PROSPECT OF TROUBLE AT ANY MOMENT LINCOLN WAS LYING ON THE BED APPARENTLY PAYING NO ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING ON LAMBORN WAS TALKING
7569-102240-0013 AND WE SUDDENLY HEARD BAKER INTERRUPTING HIM WITH A SHARP REMARK
7569-102240-0014 AND WAS PREVENTING THE WHIGS FROM VOTING LINCOLN STARTED OFF AT A GAIT WHICH SHOWED HIS INTEREST IN THE MATTER IN HAND HE WENT UP TO RADFORD AND PERSUADED HIM TO LEAVE THE POLLS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY ONE OF HIS CANDID REMARKS IS REMEMBERED AND RECORDED
7569-102240-0015 RADFORD YOU'LL SPOIL AND BLOW IF YOU LIVE MUCH LONGER
7569-102240-0016 EARLY IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY IT SEEMED POSSIBLE THAT THE WHIGS MIGHT ELECT GENERAL HARRISON TO THE PRESIDENCY AND THIS HOPE LENT ADDED ENERGY TO THE PARTY EVEN IN THE STATES WHERE THE MAJORITY WAS SO STRONGLY AGAINST THEM AS IN ILLINOIS
7569-102240-0017 AND THREW HIMSELF WITH ARDOR INTO THE CANVASS TRAVERSING A GREAT PART OF THE STATE AND SPEAKING WITH REMARKABLE EFFECT ONLY ONE OF THE SPEECHES HE MADE DURING THE YEAR HAS BEEN PRESERVED ENTIRE
7569-102240-0018 A RATTLING STUMP SPEECH OF THE KIND THEN UNIVERSALLY POPULAR IN THE WEST AND WHICH IS STILL CONSIDERED A VERY HIGH GRADE OF ELOQUENCE IN THE SOUTH BUT IT IS OF NO KINDRED WITH HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESSES
7569-102240-0019 MISTER LAMBORN INSISTS THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VAN BUREN PARTY AND THE WHIGS IS THAT ALTHOUGH THE FORMER SOMETIMES ERR IN PRACTICE THEY ARE ALWAYS CORRECT IN PRINCIPLE WHEREAS THE LATTER ARE WRONG IN PRINCIPLE AND THE BETTER TO IMPRESS THIS PROPOSITION
7569-102240-0020 THE FIRST BRANCH OF THE FIGURE THAT IS THE DEMOCRATS ARE VULNERABLE IN THE HEEL I ADMIT IS NOT MERELY FIGURATIVELY BUT LITERALLY TRUE WHO THAT LOOKS BUT FOR A MOMENT AT THEIR SWARTWOUTS THEIR PRICES THEIR HARRINGTONS
7569-102240-0021 AND THEIR HUNDREDS OF OTHERS SCAMPERING AWAY WITH THE PUBLIC MONEY TO TEXAS TO EUROPE AND TO EVERY SPOT OF THE EARTH WHERE A VILLAIN MAY HOPE TO FIND REFUGE FROM JUSTICE CAN AT ALL DOUBT THAT THEY ARE MOST DISTRESSINGLY AFFECTED IN THEIR HEELS
7569-102240-0022 WITH A SPECIES OF RUNNING ITCH IT SEEMS THAT THIS MALADY OF THEIR HEELS OPERATES ON THE SOUND HEADED AND HONEST HEARTED CREATURES VERY MUCH AS THE CORK LEG IN THE COMIC SONG DID ON ITS OWNER WHICH WHEN HE ONCE GOT STARTED ON IT
7569-102240-0023 THE MORE HE TRIED TO STOP IT THE MORE IT WOULD RUN AWAY AT THE HAZARD OF WEARING THIS POINT THREADBARE I WILL RELATE AN ANECDOTE WHICH SEEMS TO BE TOO STRIKINGLY IN POINT TO BE OMITTED A WITTY IRISH SOLDIER
7569-102240-0024 WHO WAS ALWAYS BOASTING OF HIS BRAVERY WHEN NO DANGER WAS NEAR BUT WHO INVARIABLY RETREATED WITHOUT ORDERS AT THE FIRST CHARGE OF THE ENGAGEMENT BEING ASKED BY HIS CAPTAIN WHY HE DID SO REPLIED CAPTAIN
7569-102240-0025 ADDRESS THAT ARGUMENT TO COWARDS AND SLAVES WITH THE FREE AND THE BRAVE IT WILL AFFECT NOTHING IT MAY BE TRUE IF IT MUST LET IT MANY FREE COUNTRIES HAVE LOST THEIR LIBERTY AND OURS MAY LOSE HERS BUT IF SHE SHALL
7569-102240-0026 BE IT MY PROUDEST PLUME NOT THAT I WAS THE LAST TO DESERT BUT THAT I NEVER DESERTED HER I KNOW THAT THE GREAT VOLCANO AT WASHINGTON AROUSED AND DIRECTED BY THE EVIL SPIRIT THAT REIGNS THERE
7569-102240-0027 NO GREEN SPOT OR LIVING THING WHILE ON ITS BOSOM ARE RIDING LIKE DEMONS ON THE WAVE OF HELL THE IMPS OF THE EVIL SPIRIT AND FIENDISHLY TAUNTING ALL THOSE WHO DARE TO RESIST ITS DESTROYING COURSE
7569-102240-0028 WITH THE HOPELESSNESS OF THEIR EFFORTS AND KNOWING THIS I CANNOT DENY THAT ALL MAY BE SWEPT AWAY BROKEN BY IT I TOO MAY BE BOW TO IT I NEVER WILL
7569-102240-0029 IF EVER I FEEL THE SOUL WITHIN ME ELEVATE AND EXPAND TO THOSE DIMENSIONS NOT WHOLLY UNWORTHY OF ITS ALMIGHTY ARCHITECT IT IS WHEN I CONTEMPLATE THE CAUSE OF MY COUNTRY DESERTED BY ALL THE WORLD BESIDE
7569-102240-0030 AND I STANDING UP BOLDLY ALONE HURLING DEFIANCE AT HER VICTORIOUS OPPRESSORS HERE WITHOUT CONTEMPLATING CONSEQUENCES BEFORE HEAVEN AND IN FACE OF THE WORLD
7569-102240-0031 LET NONE FALTER WHO THINKS HE IS RIGHT AND WE MAY SUCCEED BUT IF AFTER ALL WE SHOULD FAIL BE IT SO WE STILL SHALL HAVE THE PROUD CONSOLATION OF SAYING TO OUR CONSCIENCES
7569-102240-0032 THESE PERFERVID AND MUSICAL METAPHORS OF DEVOTION AND DEFIANCE HAVE OFTEN BEEN QUOTED AS MISTER LINCOLN'S HEROIC CHALLENGE TO THE SLAVE POWER AND BISHOP SIMPSON GAVE THEM THAT LOFTY SIGNIFICANCE IN HIS FUNERAL ORATION
7569-102240-0033 BUT THEY WERE SIMPLY THE UTTERANCES OF A YOUNG AND ARDENT WHIG EARNESTLY ADVOCATING THE ELECTION OF OLD TIPPECANOE AND NOT UNWILLING WHILE DOING THIS TO SHOW THE PEOPLE OF THE CAPITAL A SPECIMEN OF HIS ELOQUENCE
7569-102240-0034 THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN WAS CARRIED ON IN A TONE SOMEWHAT SHRILL THE WHIGS WERE RECOVERING FROM THE NUMBNESS INTO WHICH THEY HAD FALLEN DURING THE TIME OF JACKSON'S IMPERIOUS PREDOMINANCE
7569-102240-0035 AND IN THE NEW PROSPECT OF SUCCESS THEY FELT ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF PROSPEROUS REBELS THE TAUNTS OF THE PARTY IN POWER WHEN HARRISON'S NOMINATION WAS FIRST MENTIONED THEIR SNEERS AT HARD CIDER AND LOG CABINS
7569-102240-0036 HAD BEEN DEXTEROUSLY ADOPTED AS THE SLOGAN OF THE OPPOSITION AND GAVE RISE TO THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY CAMPAIGN LOG CABINS WERE BUILT IN EVERY WESTERN COUNTY
7569-102240-0037 TUNS OF HARD CIDER WERE FILLED AND EMPTIED AT ALL THE WHIG MASS MEETINGS AND AS THE CANVASS GAINED MOMENTUM AND VEHEMENCE A CURIOUS KIND OF MUSIC ADDED ITS INSPIRATION TO THE CAUSE AND AFTER THE MAINE ELECTION WAS OVER
7569-102240-0038 SHE WENT HELL BENT FOR GOVERNOR KENT AND TIPPECANOE AND TYLER TOO IT WAS ONE OF THE BUSIEST AND MOST ENJOYABLE SEASONS OF LINCOLN'S LIFE HE HAD GROWN BY THIS TIME THOROUGHLY AT HOME IN POLITICAL CONTROVERSY
7569-102240-0039 AND HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF FREQUENTLY MEETING MISTER DOUGLAS IN ROUGH AND TUMBLE DEBATE
7569-102240-0040 I HAVE BEEN TO THE SECRETARY'S OFFICE WITHIN THE LAST HOUR AND FIND THINGS PRECISELY AS YOU LEFT THEM NO NEW ARRIVALS OF RETURNS ON EITHER SIDE DOUGLAS HAS NOT BEEN HERE SINCE YOU LEFT A REPORT IS IN CIRCULATION HERE NOW THAT HE HAS ABANDONED
7569-102240-0041 THERE IS NO NEWS HERE NOAH I STILL THINK WILL BE ELECTED VERY EASILY I AM AFRAID OF OUR RACE FOR REPRESENTATIVE DOCTOR KNAPP HAS BECOME A CANDIDATE AND I FEAR THE FEW VOTES HE WILL GET WILL BE TAKEN FROM US ALSO
7569-102240-0042 AGAIN HE WROTE ON NEW YEAR'S DAY EIGHTEEN FORTY A LETTER CURIOUSLY DESTITUTE OF ANY FESTAL SUGGESTIONS
7569-102240-0043 WHEREAS BY ANOTHER YEAR THEY MAY BE BROUGHT IN AGAIN THE WHIGS OF OUR DISTRICT SAY THAT EVERYTHING IS IN FAVOR OF HOLDING THE ELECTION NEXT SUMMER EXCEPT THE FACT OF YOUR ABSENCE AND SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE REQUESTED ME TO ASK YOUR OPINION ON THE MATTER
7569-102240-0044 WRITE ME IMMEDIATELY WHAT YOU THINK OF IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS SHEET I SEND YOU A COPY OF MY LAND RESOLUTIONS WHICH PASSED BOTH BRANCHES OF OUR LEGISLATURE LAST WINTER WILL YOU SHOW THEM TO MISTER CALHOUN
7569-102240-0045 INFORMING HIM OF THE FACT OF THEIR PASSAGE THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE MISTER CALHOUN SUGGESTED A SIMILAR PROPOSITION LAST WINTER AND PERHAPS IF HE FINDS HIMSELF BACKED BY ONE OF THE STATES HE MAY BE INDUCED TO TAKE IT UP AGAIN
7569-102240-0046 AFTER THE SESSION OPENED JANUARY TWENTIETH HE WROTE TO MISTER STUART ACCURATELY OUTLINING THE WORK OF THE WINTER
7569-102240-0047 STATE AFFAIRS HAVE EVIDENTLY LOST THEIR INTEREST HOWEVER AND HIS SOUL IS IN ARMS FOR THE WIDER FRAY
7569-102240-0048 BE SURE TO SEND ME AS MANY COPIES OF THE LIFE OF HARRISON AS YOU CAN SPARE BE VERY SURE TO SEND ME THE SENATE JOURNAL OF NEW YORK FOR SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN
7569-102240-0049 HE HAD SEEN IN A NEWSPAPER A CHARGE OF DISLOYALTY MADE AGAINST MISTER VAN BUREN DURING THE WAR WITH GREAT BRITAIN BUT AS USUAL WANTED TO BE SURE OF HIS FACTS AND IN GENERAL HE ADDS
7569-102240-0050 SEND ME EVERYTHING YOU THINK WILL BE A GOOD WAR CLUB THE NOMINATION OF HARRISON TAKES FIRST RATE YOU KNOW I AM NEVER SANGUINE BUT I BELIEVE WE WILL CARRY THE STATE THE CHANCE FOR DOING SO APPEARS TO ME TWENTY FIVE PER CENT
7569-102240-0051 BETTER THAN IT DID FOR YOU TO BEAT DOUGLAS A GREAT MANY OF THE GROCERY SORT OF VAN BUREN MEN ARE OUT FOR HARRISON OUR IRISH BLACKSMITH GREGORY IS FOR HARRISON
7569-102240-0052 YOU HAVE HEARD THAT THE WHIGS AND LOCOS HAD A POLITICAL DISCUSSION SHORTLY AFTER THE MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE WELL I MADE A BIG SPEECH WHICH IS IN PROGRESS OF PRINTING IN PAMPHLET FORM TO ENLIGHTEN YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD I SHALL SEND YOU A COPY WHEN IT IS FINISHED
7569-102240-0053 THE BIG SPEECH WAS THE ONE FROM WHICH WE HAVE JUST QUOTED THE SANGUINE MOOD CONTINUED IN HIS NEXT LETTER MARCH FIRST
7569-102240-0054 I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PROSPECTS OF OUR PARTY SO BRIGHT IN THESE PARTS AS THEY ARE NOW WE SHALL CARRY THIS COUNTY BY A LARGER MAJORITY THAN WE DID IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX WHEN YOU RAN AGAINST MAY
7569-102240-0055 I DO NOT THINK MY PROSPECTS INDIVIDUALLY ARE VERY FLATTERING FOR I THINK IT PROBABLE I SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO BE A CANDIDATE BUT THE PARTY TICKET WILL SUCCEED TRIUMPHANTLY SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE OLD SOLDIER POUR IN WITHOUT ABATEMENT
7569-102240-0056 THIS MORNING I TOOK FROM THE POST OFFICE A LETTER FROM DUBOIS INCLOSING THE NAMES OF SIXTY SUBSCRIBERS AND ON CARRYING IT TO FRANCIS
7569-102240-0057 FRANCIS CAUGHT HIM BY THE HAIR AND JAMMED HIM BACK AGAINST A MARKET CART WHERE THE MATTER ENDED BY FRANCIS BEING PULLED AWAY FROM HIM THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS SO LUDICROUS THAT FRANCIS AND EVERYBODY ELSE DOUGLAS EXCEPTED HAVE BEEN LAUGHING ABOUT IT EVER SINCE
7569-102240-0058 DOUGLAS SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A GREAT PROPENSITY TO SUCH RENCONTRES OF WHICH THE ISSUE WAS ORDINARILY HIS COMPLETE DISCOMFITURE AS HE HAD THE UNTOWARD HABIT OF ATTACKING MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER MEN THAN HIMSELF
7569-102240-0059 HE WEIGHED AT THAT TIME LITTLE IF ANYTHING OVER A HUNDRED POUNDS YET HIS HEART WAS SO VALIANT THAT HE MADE NOTHING OF ASSAULTING MEN OF PONDEROUS FLESH LIKE FRANCIS OR OF GREAT HEIGHT AND STRENGTH LIKE STUART
7569-102240-0060 HE SOUGHT A QUARREL WITH THE LATTER DURING THEIR CANVASS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IN A GROCERY WITH THE USUAL RESULT
7569-102240-0061 JEST MOPPED THE FLOOR WITH HIM IN THE SAME LETTER MISTER LINCOLN GIVES A LONG LIST OF NAMES TO WHICH HE WANTS DOCUMENTS TO BE SENT IT SHOWS A REMARKABLE PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MINUTEST NEEDS OF THE CANVASS THIS ONE IS A DOUBTFUL WHIG
7569-102240-0062 THAT ONE IS AN INQUIRING DEMOCRAT
7569-102240-0063 HE TELLS STUART THAT JOE SMITH IS AN ADMIRER OF HIS AND THAT A FEW DOCUMENTS HAD BETTER BE MAILED TO THE MORMONS AND HE MUST BE SURE THE NEXT TIME HE WRITES TO SEND EVAN BUTLER HIS COMPLIMENTS IT WOULD BE STRANGE INDEED
7569-102240-0064 THE RURAL DELEGATES TOOK ALL THE NOMINATIONS AWAY FROM SPRINGFIELD EXCEPT TWO BAKER FOR THE SENATE AND LINCOLN FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NINIAN HE SAYS MEANING NINIAN W EDWARDS
7569-102240-0065 WAS VERY MUCH HURT AT NOT BEING NOMINATED BUT HE HAS BECOME TOLERABLY WELL RECONCILED I WAS MUCH VERY MUCH WOUNDED MYSELF AT HIS BEING LEFT OUT THE FACT IS THE COUNTRY DELEGATES MADE THE NOMINATIONS AS THEY PLEASED
7569-102240-0066 HARRISON WAS ELECTED IN NOVEMBER AND THE GREAT PREOCCUPATION OF MOST OF THE WHIGS WAS OF COURSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OFFICES WHICH THEY FELT BELONGED TO THEM AS THE SPOILS OF BATTLE
7569-102240-0067 BUT WE ARE LEFT IN NO DOUBT AS TO THE WAY IN WHICH LINCOLN REGARDED THE UNSEEMLY SCRAMBLE IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE WAS ASKED TO EXPRESS HIS PREFERENCE AMONG APPLICANTS AND HE WROTE UNDER DATE OF DECEMBER SEVENTEENTH
7569-102240-0068 THIS AFFAIR OF APPOINTMENTS TO OFFICE IS VERY ANNOYING MORE SO TO YOU THAN TO ME DOUBTLESS I AM AS YOU KNOW OPPOSED TO REMOVALS TO MAKE PLACES FOR OUR FRIENDS BEARING THIS IN MIND
7569-102240-0069 I EXPRESS MY PREFERENCE IN A FEW CASES AS FOLLOWS FOR MARSHAL FIRST JOHN DAWSON SECOND B F EDWARDS FOR POSTMASTER HERE DOCTOR HENRY AT CARLINVILLE JOSEPH C HOWELL
7569-102240-0070 THE MENTION OF THIS LAST POST OFFICE ROUSES HIS RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION AND HE CALLS FOR JUSTICE UPON A WRONG DOER
7569-102240-0071 THERE IS NO QUESTION OF THE PROPRIETY OF REMOVING THE POSTMASTER AT CARLINVILLE I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SO MANY DIFFERENT PERSONS AS TO PRECLUDE ALL DOUBT OF ITS TRUTH THAT HE BOLDLY REFUSED TO DELIVER FROM HIS OFFICE DURING THE CANVASS
7569-102240-0072 ONCE MORE
7569-102240-0073 HE ADDRESSES A LETTER TO MISTER STUART WHICH CLOSES THE CORRESPONDENCE AND WHICH AFFORDS A GLIMPSE OF THAT STRANGE CONDITION OF MELANCHOLIA INTO WHOSE DARK SHADOW HE WAS THEN ENTERING
7569-102240-0074 AND WHICH LASTED WITH ONLY OCCASIONAL INTERVALS OF HEALTHY CHEERFULNESS TO THE TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE WE GIVE THIS REMARKABLE LETTER ENTIRE FROM THE MANUSCRIPT SUBMITTED TO US BY THE LATE JOHN T STUART DEAR STUART
7569-102240-0075 THOUGH FROM THE DEPLORABLE STATE OF MY MIND AT THIS TIME I FEAR I SHALL GIVE YOU BUT LITTLE SATISFACTION ABOUT THE MATTER OF THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION
7569-102240-0076 AND NONE THAT I CAN LEARN AMONG OUR ENEMIES THOUGH OF COURSE THERE WILL BE IF THE GENERAL TICKET BE ADOPTED THE CHICAGO AMERICAN PEORIA REGISTER AND SANGAMO JOURNAL HAVE ALREADY HOISTED YOUR FLAG UPON THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY
7569-102240-0077 AND THE OTHER WHIG PAPERS OF THE DISTRICT ARE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY ON LAST EVENING THERE WAS A MEETING OF OUR FRIENDS AT BUTLER'S AND I SUBMITTED THE QUESTION TO THEM AND FOUND THEM UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOR OF HAVING YOU ANNOUNCED AS A CANDIDATE
7569-102240-0078 WE WOULD DELAY ANNOUNCING YOU AS BY YOUR AUTHORITY FOR A WEEK OR TWO WE THOUGHT THAT TO APPEAR TOO KEEN ABOUT IT MIGHT SPUR OUR OPPONENTS ON ABOUT THEIR GENERAL TICKET PROJECT UPON THE WHOLE I THINK I MAY SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT YOUR REELECTION IS SURE
7569-102240-0079 IF WHAT I FEEL WERE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED TO THE WHOLE HUMAN FAMILY THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE CHEERFUL FACE ON EARTH WHETHER I SHALL EVER BE BETTER I CANNOT TELL I AWFULLY FOREBODE I SHALL NOT
7569-102240-0080 TO REMAIN AS I AM IS IMPOSSIBLE I MUST DIE OR BE BETTER IT APPEARS TO ME THE MATTER YOU SPEAK OF ON MY ACCOUNT YOU MAY ATTEND TO AS YOU SAY UNLESS YOU SHALL HEAR OF MY CONDITION FORBIDDING IT
7569-102240-0081 I SAY THIS BECAUSE I FEAR I SHALL BE UNABLE TO ATTEND TO ANY BUSINESS HERE AND A CHANGE OF SCENE MIGHT HELP ME IF I COULD BE MYSELF I WOULD RATHER REMAIN AT HOME WITH JUDGE LOGAN I CAN WRITE NO MORE
7569-102240-0082 YOUR FRIEND AS EVER
