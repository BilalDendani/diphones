8778-246984-0000 THE MOST SHADOWY CONCEPTION IT HAD BEEN A SEASON OF GREAT TROUBLE BUT THE GAIN HAD BEEN INFINITELY GREATER FOR NOW WERE THE BONDS OF THE FINITE BROKEN HE HAD BURST THE SHELL OF THE MORTAL
8778-246984-0001 AND WAS OF THOSE OVER WHOM THE SECOND DEATH HATH NO POWER THE AGONY OF THE SECOND BIRTH WAS PAST AND HE WAS A CHILD AGAIN ONLY A CHILD HE KNEW BUT A CHILD OF THE KINGDOM AND THE WORLD
8778-246984-0002 LAY OPEN TO HIM IN THE BOUNDLESS FREE GIVING OF THE ORIGINAL THOUGHT ALL THINGS ARE YOURS AND YE ARE CHRIST'S AND CHRIST IS GOD'S HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS EVEN AS HE WHO SAID THEM UNDERSTOOD THEM
8778-246984-0003 AND AS THE WISE OF THIS WORLD NEVER WILL UNDERSTAND THEM UNTIL FIRST THEY BECOME FOOLS THAT THEY MAY BE WISE AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT SORROW THREATENED HIM
8778-246984-0004 FROM THE NO LESS MYSTERIOUS REGION OF HIS RELATIONS TO HUMANITY BUT IF THAT REGION AND ITS MOST INEXPLICABLE CARES WERE BEYOND THE RULE OF THE LIFE THAT DWELT IN HIM THEN
8778-246984-0005 WHEN IT THREATENED TO OVERWHELM HIM WAS UNABLE TO UPHOLD HIM UNDER IT THIS THING ALSO BELONGED TO THE GOD OF HIS BEING A POOR GOD MUST HE BE FOR MEN OR WOMEN
8778-246984-0006 AT THE THOUGHT OF NEVER GAINING HER LOVE HE HAD NEVER YET INDEED CONSCIOUSLY REGARDED THE WINNING OF HER AS A POSSIBILITY BUT AT THOSE TIMES
8778-246984-0007 WHEN HE SAW HER SO CAPABLE OF THE NOBLEST SUBMITTING HER MIND TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE POOREST MEANEST SHABBIEST THEORIES OF LIFE AND TAKING FOR HER GUIDE
8778-246984-0008 WHEN HE SAW HER ADOPTING A SYSTEM OF THINGS WHOSE INFLUENCE WOULD SHRIVEL UP INSTEAD OF DEVELOPING HER FACULTIES CRUSH HER IMAGINATION WITH SUCH A MOUNTAIN WEIGHT AS WAS NEVER PILED ABOVE TITAN
8778-246984-0009 AND GOD LOVES HER BETTER THAN EVER I COULD LOVE HER IF SHE SHOULD SET OUT WITH HER BLIND GUIDE IT WILL BE BUT A FIRST DAY'S JOURNEY SHE WILL GO THROUGH MARSHY PLACES AND DRY SANDS
8778-246984-0010 THE BLUE MOUNTAINS THAT SHELTER THE HIGH VALES OF SWEETNESS AND PEACE AND WITH THIS HE NOT ONLY TRIED TO COMFORT HIMSELF BUT SUCCEEDED I DO NOT SAY TO CONTENTMENT
8778-246984-0011 BUT TO QUIET CONTENTMENT WHICH WHATEVER ITS IMMEDIATE SHAPE TO BE CONTENTMENT AT ALL MUST BE THE WILL OF GOD LAY BEYOND ALAS THAT MEN CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS SUCH A THING AS
8778-246984-0012 AND PERFECT WILL OF GOD TO THOSE THAT DO BELIEVE IT
8778-246984-0013 THE BISHOP HAD HEARD NOTHING OF THE MATTER AND IF ANYTHING HAD REACHED THE RECTOR HE HAD NOT SPOKEN NOT ONE OF THE CONGREGATION NOT EVEN MISSUS RAMSHORN HAD HINTED TO HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO RESIGN
8778-246984-0014 IT HAD BEEN LEFT ALTOGETHER WITH HIMSELF AND NOW HE WOULD TELL THEM THE DECISION TO WHICH THE THOUGHT HE HAD TAKEN HAD CONDUCTED HIM
8778-246984-0015 ENOUGH TO SHOW US HOW HE SHOWED THE CONGREGATION THE STATE OF HIS MIND IN REFERENCE TO THE GRAND QUESTION AND THE POSITION HE TOOK IN RELATION TO HIS HEARERS
8778-246984-0016 IT IS TIME MY HEARERS HE SAID BECAUSE IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO BRING TO A CLOSE THAT UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARD TO THE CONTINUANCE OF OUR RELATION TO EACH OTHER
8778-246984-0017 COMPELLED BY MENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE TO OCCASION I THEN FORCED MYSELF FOR VERY DREAD OF THE HONESTY OF AN ALL KNOWING GOD TO BREAK THROUGH EVERY CONVENTION OF THE CHURCH AND THE PULPIT
8778-246984-0018 AND SPEAK TO YOU OF MY MOST PRIVATE AFFAIRS I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS SURE OF NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS CONCERNING WHICH IT IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT A CLERGYMAN MUST BE SATISFIED
8778-246984-0019 OR PROFFERED INSTRUCTION YOU MY HEARERS HAVE GRANTED ME THE LEISURE OF WHICH I STOOD IN NEED MEANTIME I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO SHOW YOU THE BEST I SAW WHILE YET I DARED NOT SAY

8778-246984-0021 I SAY THAT I WILL NOT FORSAKE MY CURACY STILL LESS MY RIGHT AND DUTY TO TEACH WHATEVER I SEEM TO KNOW I MUST NOT THEREIN CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAVE ATTAINED THAT CONVICTION
8778-246984-0022 AND ASSURANCE THE DISCOVERY OF THE ABSENCE OF WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THE WHOLE UNCERTAIN PROCEEDING
8778-246984-0023 I HAVE BEHELD SUCH GRANDEUR TO ME APPARENTLY ALTOGETHER BEYOND THE REACH OF HUMAN INVENTION SUCH A RADIATION OF DIVINE LOVELINESS AND TRUTH SUCH HOPE FOR MAN
8778-246984-0024 SUCH A DEEPENING OF MORAL STRENGTH SUCH AN ENHANCEMENT OF IDEAL SUCH AN INCREASE OF FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY TOWARDS ALL MEN THAT I NOW DECLARE WITH THE CONSENT OF MY WHOLE MAN
8778-246984-0025 I CAST IN MY LOT WITH THE SERVANTS OF THE CRUCIFIED I AM CONTENT EVEN TO SHARE THEIR DELUSION IF DELUSION IT BE
8778-246984-0026 I WILL STAND OR FALL WITH THE STORY OF MY LORD
8778-246984-0027 CAN SET A MAN FREE FROM IN BURROWING SLAVERY AND IF ANY MAN YET SAY THAT BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE I HAVE NO RIGHT TO THE SACRED POST LET HIM I ANSWER
8778-246984-0028 WHO HAS BEEN ASSAILED BY SUCH DOUBTS AS MINE AND FROM THE CITADEL OF HIS FAITH SEES NO MORE ONE LINGERING SHADOW OF A FOE LET HIM CAST AT ME THE FIRST STONE VAIN CHALLENGE
8778-246984-0029 FOR SUCH A ONE WILL NEVER CAST A STONE AT MAN OR WOMAN BUT LET NOT HIM WHOSE BELIEF IS BUT THE ABSENCE OF DOUBT WHO HAS NEVER LOVED ENOUGH THAT WHICH HE THINKS HE BELIEVES TO HAVE FELT A SINGLE FEAR LEST IT SHOULD NOT BE TRUE
8778-246984-0030 LET NOT THAT MAN I SAY
8778-246984-0031 OR CLOVEN ROCK FROM THE MOUNT OF THE LAW FOR EITHER
8778-246984-0032 I HAVE FOR THE LAST TIME SPOKEN OF MYSELF IN THIS PLACE YE HAVE BORNE WITH ME IN MY TRIALS AND I THANK YOU THOSE WHO HAVE NOT ONLY BORNE BUT SUFFERED AND DO NOW REJOICE WITH ME
8778-246984-0033 I THANK TENFOLD I HAVE DONE SAVE FOR ONE WORD TO THE CHRISTIANS OF THIS CONGREGATION
8778-246984-0034 THEY ARE AS THEY WERE IT IS THE CHRISTIANS WHO ARE TO BLAME I DO NOT MEAN THOSE WHO ARE CALLED CHRISTIANS BUT THOSE WHO CALL AND COUNT THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS I TELL YOU AND I SPEAK TO EACH ONE OF WHOM IT IS TRUE
8778-246984-0035 THAT YOU HOLD AND PRESENT SUCH A WITHERED STARVED MISERABLE DEATH'S HEAD IDEA OF CHRISTIANITY THAT YOU ARE YOURSELVES SUCH POVERTY STRICKEN BELIEVERS IF BELIEVERS YOU ARE AT ALL
8778-246984-0036 AND RIDES NOT FORTH ON THE WHITE HORSE CONQUERING AND TO CONQUER YOU DULL ITS LUSTRE IN THE EYES OF MEN YOU DEFORM ITS FAIR PROPORTIONS
8778-246984-0037 YET CALL YOURSELVES BY ITS NAME YOU ARE NOT THE SALT OF THE EARTH BUT A SALT THAT HAS LOST ITS SAVOUR FOR YE SEEK ALL THINGS ELSE FIRST AND TO THAT SEEKING THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS
8778-246984-0038 SHALL NEVER BE ADDED UNTIL YOU REPENT AND BELIEVE AFRESH BELIEVE IN A NOBLER CHRIST NAMELY THE CHRIST REVEALED BY HIMSELF AND NOT THE MUFFLED FORM OF SOMETHING VAGUELY HUMAN
8778-246984-0039 WHICH THE FALSE INTERPRETATIONS OF MEN HAVE SUBSTITUTED FOR HIM YOU WILL BE AS I REPEAT YOU ARE THE MAIN REASON WHY FAITH IS SO SCANTY IN THE EARTH AND THE ENEMY COMES IN LIKE A FLOOD
8778-246984-0040 FOR THE SAKE OF THE PROGRESS OF THE TRUTH AND THAT INTO NOBLER MINDS THAN YOURS IT WERE BETTER YOU JOINED THE RANKS OF THE ENEMY AND DECLARED WHAT I FEAR WITH MANY OF YOU IS THE FACT THAT YOU BELIEVE NOT AT ALL
8778-246984-0041 BUT WHETHER IN SOME SENSE YOU BELIEVE OR NOT THE FACT REMAINS THAT WHILE YOU ARE NOT OF THOSE CHRISTIANS WHO OBEY THE WORD OF THE MASTER DOING THE THINGS HE SAYS TO THEM YOU ARE OF THOSE CHRISTIANS
8778-246984-0042 IF YOU WILL BE CALLED BY THE NAME
