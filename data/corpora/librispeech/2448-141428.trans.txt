2448-141428-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT A DISCONTENTED SHADE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID SHAKESPEARE WEARILY ONE AFTERNOON AT THE CLUB
2448-141428-0001 DIDN'T SOMEBODY ONCE SAY HE'D RATHER RIDE FIFTY YEARS ON A TROLLEY IN EUROPE THAN ON A BICYCLE IN CATHAY
2448-141428-0002 SAID JOHNSON I SAID SOMETHING LIKE IT OBSERVED TENNYSON DOCTOR JOHNSON LOOKED AROUND TO SEE WHO IT WAS THAT SPOKE YOU HE CRIED AND WHO PRAY MAY YOU BE
2448-141428-0003 MY NAME IS TENNYSON REPLIED THE POET
2448-141428-0004 SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON DID YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF I DID SAID THE LATE LAUREATE PROUDLY IN WHAT PURSUIT ASKED DOCTOR JOHNSON POETRY SAID TENNYSON
2448-141428-0005 I WROTE LOCKSLEY HALL AND COME INTO THE GARDEN MAUDE HUMPH SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON I NEVER READ EM
2448-141428-0006 THEY WERE WRITTEN AFTER YOU MOVED OVER HERE AND THEY WERE GOOD STUFF
2448-141428-0007 I DID A FEW THINGS MYSELF WHICH I FANCY YOU NEVER HEARD OF OH AS FOR THAT RETORTED DOCTOR JOHNSON WITH A SMILE I'VE HEARD OF YOU
2448-141428-0008 YOU ARE THE MAN WHO WROTE THE LIFE OF FREDERICK THE GREAT IN NINE HUNDRED AND TWO VOLUMES SEVEN SNAPPED CARLYLE WELL SEVEN THEN RETURNED JOHNSON
2448-141428-0009 I NEVER SAW THE WORK BUT I HEARD FREDERICK SPEAKING OF IT THE OTHER DAY BONAPARTE ASKED HIM IF HE HAD READ IT AND FREDERICK SAID NO HE HADN'T TIME BONAPARTE CRIED HAVEN'T TIME WHY MY DEAR KING YOU'VE GOT ALL ETERNITY
2448-141428-0010 I KNOW IT REPLIED FREDERICK BUT THAT ISN'T ENOUGH READ A PAGE OR TWO MY DEAR NAPOLEON AND YOU'LL SEE WHY FREDERICK WILL HAVE HIS JOKE SAID SHAKESPEARE
2448-141428-0011 WITH A WINK AT TENNYSON AND A SMILE FOR THE TWO PHILOSOPHERS INTENDED NO DOUBT TO PUT THEM IN A MORE AGREEABLE FRAME OF MIND WHY HE EVEN ASKED ME THE OTHER DAY WHY I NEVER WROTE A TRAGEDY ABOUT HIM
2448-141428-0012 I SPOKE OF THAT AND HE SAID OH I WAS ONLY JOKING I APOLOGIZED I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SAID I AND WHY SHOULD YOU SAID HE YOU'RE ENGLISH
2448-141428-0013 A VERY RUDE REMARK SAID JOHNSON AS IF WE ENGLISH WERE INCAPABLE OF SEEING A JOKE EXACTLY PUT IN CARLYLE IT STRIKES ME AS THE ABSURDEST NOTION THAT THE ENGLISHMAN CAN'T SEE A JOKE
2448-141428-0014 TO THE MIND THAT IS ACCUSTOMED TO SNAP JUDGMENTS I HAVE NO DOUBT THE ENGLISHMAN APPEARS TO BE DULL OF APPREHENSION BUT THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE WHOLE MATTER IS APPARENT TO THE MIND THAT TAKES THE TROUBLE TO INVESTIGATE
2448-141428-0015 THE BRITON WEIGHS EVERYTHING CAREFULLY BEFORE HE COMMITS HIMSELF AND EVEN THOUGH A CERTAIN POINT MAY STRIKE HIM AS FUNNY HE ISN'T GOING TO LAUGH UNTIL HE HAS FULLY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT IS FUNNY
2448-141428-0016 AND HE BEGAN TO LAUGH IMMODERATELY OVER SOMETHING
2448-141428-0017 THAT ISN'T SO FUNNY SAID I AS I READ THE PARAGRAPH ON WHICH HIS EYE WAS RESTING NO SAID FROUDE I WASN'T LAUGHING AT THAT
2448-141428-0018 THE WHOLE POINT THE ENGLISHMAN ALWAYS LAUGHS OVER LAST WEEK'S PUNCH NOT THIS WEEK'S AND THAT IS WHY YOU WILL FIND A FILE OF THAT INTERESTING JOURNAL IN THE HOME OF ALL WELL TO DO BRITONS IT IS THE BACK NUMBER THAT AMUSES HIM
2448-141428-0019 WHICH MERELY PROVES THAT HE IS A DELIBERATIVE PERSON WHO WEIGHS EVEN HIS HUMOR CAREFULLY BEFORE GIVING WAY TO HIS EMOTIONS WHAT IS THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF A COPY OF PUNCH
2448-141428-0020 DRAWLED ARTEMAS WARD WHO HAD STROLLED IN DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE CONVERSATION SHAKESPEARE SNICKERED QUIETLY BUT CARLYLE AND JOHNSON LOOKED UPON THE INTRUDER SEVERELY WE WILL TAKE THAT QUESTION INTO CONSIDERATION
2448-141428-0021 SAID CARLYLE PERHAPS TO MORROW WE SHALL HAVE A DEFINITE ANSWER READY FOR YOU NEVER MIND RETURNED THE HUMORIST YOU'VE PROVED YOUR POINT TENNYSON TELLS ME YOU FIND LIFE HERE DULL SHAKESPEARE SOMEWHAT
2448-141428-0022 SAID SHAKESPEARE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF YOU FELLOWS BUT I WAS NOT CUT OUT FOR AN ETERNITY OF EASE I MUST HAVE OCCUPATION AND THE STAGE ISN'T POPULAR HERE THE TROUBLE ABOUT PUTTING ON A PLAY HERE
2448-141428-0023 IS THAT OUR MANAGERS ARE AFRAID OF LIBEL SUITS THE CHANCES ARE THAT IF I SHOULD WRITE A PLAY WITH CASSIUS AS THE HERO CASSIUS WOULD GO TO THE FIRST NIGHT'S PERFORMANCE WITH A DAGGER CONCEALED IN HIS TOGA
2448-141428-0024 WITH WHICH TO PUNCTUATE HIS OBJECTIONS TO THE LINES PUT IN HIS MOUTH THERE IS NOTHING I'D LIKE BETTER THAN TO MANAGE A THEATRE IN THIS PLACE BUT THINK OF THE RIOTS WE'D HAVE SUPPOSE FOR AN INSTANT THAT I WROTE A PLAY ABOUT BONAPARTE
2448-141428-0025 IF HE DIDN'T HAPPEN TO LIKE THE PLAY HE'D GREET ME WITH A SALVO OF ARTILLERY INSTEAD OF APPLAUSE
2448-141428-0026 SAID TENNYSON NO DOUBT RETURNED SHAKESPEARE SADLY BUT IN THAT EVENT WELLINGTON WOULD BE IN THE OTHER STAGE BOX AND I'D GET THE GREETING FROM HIM
2448-141428-0027 ASKED JOHNSON WHY COME OUT AT ALL ECHOED SHAKESPEARE WHAT FUN IS THERE IN WRITING A PLAY IF YOU CAN'T COME OUT AND SHOW YOURSELF AT THE FIRST NIGHT THAT'S THE AUTHOR'S REWARD IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FIRST NIGHT BUSINESS THOUGH
2448-141428-0028 ALL WOULD BE PLAIN SAILING
2448-141428-0029 HOW THE DEUCE COULD YOU PUT IN CARLYLE A MOST EXTRAORDINARY PROPOSITION SNEERED JOHNSON YES SAID WARD BUT WAIT A WEEK YOU'LL SEE THE POINT THEN
2448-141428-0030 THERE ISN'T ANY DOUBT IN MY MIND SAID SHAKESPEARE REVERTING TO HIS ORIGINAL PROPOSITION
2448-141428-0031 THE ONE WE HAVE QUITTED OR THIS THERE WE HAD HARD WORK IN WHICH OUR MORTAL LIMITATIONS HAMPERED US GRIEVOUSLY HERE WE HAVE THE FREEDOM OF THE IMMORTAL WITH NO HARD WORK IN OTHER WORDS
2448-141428-0032 NOW THAT WE FEEL LIKE FIGHTING COCKS THERE ISN'T ANY FIGHTING TO BE DONE THE GREAT LIFE IN MY ESTIMATION WOULD BE TO RETURN TO EARTH AND BATTLE WITH MORTAL PROBLEMS BUT EQUIPPED MENTALLY
2448-141428-0033 AND PHYSICALLY WITH IMMORTAL WEAPONS SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY ARE WELL OFF SAID BEAU BRUMMEL THIS STRIKES ME AS BEING AN IDEAL LIFE THERE ARE NO TAILORS BILLS TO PAY WE ARE OURSELVES NOTHING BUT MEMORIES
2448-141428-0034 AND A MEMORY CAN CLOTHE HIMSELF IN THE SHADOW OF HIS FORMER GRANDEUR
2448-141428-0035 AND AS MY MEMORY IS GOOD I FLATTER MYSELF I'M THE BEST DRESSED MAN HERE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GHOSTS OF DEPARTED UNPAID BILLS HAUNTING MY BEDSIDE AT NIGHT DOESN'T BOTHER ME IN THE LEAST
2448-141428-0036 BECAUSE THE BAILIFFS THAT IN THE OLD LIFE LENT TERROR TO AN OVERDUE ACCOUNT
2448-141428-0037 ARE KEPT IN THE LESS AGREEABLE SECTIONS OF HADES
2448-141428-0038 BUT NOW I REJOICE AT IT IF THEY HAD BEEN OF A DIFFERENT ORDER THEY MIGHT HAVE PROVEN UNPLEASANT HERE YOU ARE RIGHT MY DEAR BRUMMEL INTERPOSED MUNCHAUSEN
2448-141428-0039 THIS LIFE IS FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT IN THE OTHER SPHERE ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN WHO HAPPEN TO HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF READING MY MEMOIRS MUST HAVE BEEN STRUCK WITH THE TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTIES THAT ENCUMBERED MY PROGRESS
2448-141428-0040 IF I WISHED FOR A RARE LIQUEUR FOR MY LUNCHEON A LIQUEUR SERVED ONLY AT THE TABLE OF AN ORIENTAL POTENTATE
2448-141428-0041 ONE THOUSAND QUEENS
2448-141428-0042 HAD TO BE PERFORMED BY MYSELF ALONE AND UNAIDED TO SECURE THE DESIRED THIMBLEFUL I HAVE DESTROYED EMPIRES FOR A BON BON AT GREAT EXPENSE OF NERVOUS ENERGY THAT'S VERY LIKELY TRUE SAID CARLYLE
2448-141428-0043 I SHOULD THINK YOUR FEATS OF STRENGTH WOULD HAVE WRECKED YOUR IMAGINATION IN TIME NOT SO SAID MUNCHAUSEN ON THE CONTRARY CONTINUOUS EXERCISE SERVED ONLY TO MAKE IT STRONGER BUT
2448-141428-0044 AS I WAS GOING TO SAY IN THIS LIFE WE HAVE NONE OF THESE FEARFUL OBSTACLES IT IS A LIFE OF LEISURE AND IF I WANT A BIRD AND A COLD BOTTLE AT ANY TIME INSTEAD OF PLACING MY LIFE IN PERIL AND JEOPARDIZING THE PEACE OF ALL MANKIND TO GET IT
2448-141428-0045 DINE THEREON LIKE A WELL ORDERED CITIZEN AND SMOKE THE SPIRIT OF THE BEST CIGAR MY IMAGINATION CAN CONJURE UP YOU MISS MY POINT SAID SHAKESPEARE
2448-141428-0046 I DON'T SAY THIS LIFE IS WORSE OR BETTER THAN THE OTHER WE USED TO LIVE WHAT I DO SAY IS THAT A COMBINATION OF BOTH WOULD SUIT ME IN SHORT I'D LIKE TO LIVE HERE AND GO TO THE OTHER WORLD EVERY DAY TO BUSINESS
2448-141428-0047 HIRE AN OFFICE THERE AND PUT OUT A SIGN SOMETHING LIKE THIS WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE DRAMATIST PLAYS WRITTEN WHILE YOU WAIT I GUESS I'D FIND PLENTY TO DO GUESS AGAIN SAID TENNYSON
2448-141428-0048 MY DEAR BOY YOU FORGET ONE THING YOU ARE OUT OF DATE PEOPLE DON'T GO TO THE THEATRES TO HEAR YOU THEY GO TO SEE THE PEOPLE WHO DO YOU THAT IS TRUE SAID WARD
2448-141428-0049 AND THEY DO DO YOU MY BELOVED WILLIAM IT'S A WONDER TO ME YOU ARE NOT DIZZY TURNING OVER IN YOUR GRAVE THE WAY THEY DO YOU CAN IT BE THAT I CAN EVER BE OUT OF DATE ASKED SHAKESPEARE
2448-141428-0050 I KNOW OF COURSE THAT I HAVE TO BE ADAPTED AT TIMES BUT TO BE WHOLLY OUT OF DATE STRIKES ME AS A HARD FATE YOU'RE NOT OUT OF DATE INTERPOSED CARLYLE THE DATE IS OUT OF YOU
2448-141428-0051 THERE IS A GREAT DEMAND FOR SHAKESPEARE IN THESE DAYS BUT THERE ISN'T ANY STUFF THEN I SHOULD SUCCEED SAID SHAKESPEARE NO I DON'T THINK SO RETURNED CARLYLE YOU COULDN'T STAND THE PACE
2448-141428-0052 THE WORLD REVOLVES FASTER TO DAY THAN IT DID IN YOUR TIME MEN WRITE THREE OR FOUR PLAYS AT ONCE THIS IS WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A TYPE WRITER AGE
2448-141428-0053 THAT IS TRUE OBSERVED TENNYSON
2448-141428-0054 AND TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK WITH YOU I CANNOT EVEN CONJURE UP IN MY FANCY A PICTURE OF YOU KNOCKING OUT A TRAGEDY WITH THE RIGHT HAND ON ONE MACHINE
2448-141428-0055 HE MIGHT DO AS A GREAT MANY MODERN WRITERS DO SAID WARD
2448-141428-0056 CUT THE WHOLE THING OUT WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS AS THE POET MIGHT HAVE SAID IF HE'D BEEN CLEVER ENOUGH OH BRING ME THE SCISSORS AND BRING ME THE GLUE AND A COUPLE OF DOZEN OLD PLAYS
2448-141428-0057 I'LL CUT OUT AND PASTE A DRAMA FOR YOU THAT'LL RUN FOR QUITE SIXTY TWO DAYS OH BRING ME A DRESS MADE OF SATIN AND LACE AND A BOOK SAY JOE MILLER'S OF WIT
2448-141428-0058 AND I'LL MAKE THE OLD DRAMATISTS BLUE IN THE FACE WITH THE PLAY THAT I'LL TURN OUT FOR IT SO BRING ME THE SCISSORS AND BRING ME THE PASTE AND A DOZEN FINE OLD COMEDIES
2448-141428-0059 A FINE LINE OF DRESSES AND POPULAR TASTE I'LL MAKE A STRONG EFFORT TO PLEASE YOU DRAW A VERY BLUE PICTURE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID SHAKESPEARE SADLY WELL IT'S TRUE
2448-141428-0060 SAID CARLYLE THE WORLD ISN'T AT ALL WHAT IT USED TO BE IN ANY ONE RESPECT AND YOU FELLOWS WHO MADE GREAT REPUTATIONS CENTURIES AGO
2448-141428-0061 THE OLD GENTLEMAN COULDN'T MAKE ENOUGH OUT OF THEM IN THESE DAYS TO PAY TAXES ON HIS TUB LET ALONE EARNING HIS BREAD THAT IS EXACTLY SO SAID TENNYSON I'D BE WILLING TO WAGER TOO THAT IN THE LINE OF PERSONAL PROWESS
2448-141428-0062 EVEN D'ARTAGNAN AND ATHOS AND PORTHOS AND ARAMIS COULDN'T STAND LONDON FOR ONE DAY OR NEW YORK EITHER SAID MISTER BARNUM WHO HAD BEEN AN INTERESTED LISTENER A NEW YORK POLICEMAN COULD HAVE MANAGED THAT QUARTET WITH ONE HAND
2448-141428-0063 THEN SAID SHAKESPEARE IN THE OPINION OF YOU GENTLEMEN WE OLD TIME LIONS WOULD APPEAR TO MODERN EYES TO BE MORE OR LESS STUFFED THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT SAID CARLYLE
2448-141428-0064 BUT YOU'D DRAW SAID BARNUM HIS FACE LIGHTING UP WITH PLEASURE YOU'D DRIVE A FIVE LEGGED CALF TO SUICIDE FROM ENVY IF I COULD TAKE YOU AND CAESAR AND NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AND NERO
2448-141428-0065 OVER FOR ONE CIRCUS SEASON WE'D DRIVE THE MINT OUT OF BUSINESS THERE'S YOUR CHANCE WILLIAM SAID WARD YOU WRITE A PLAY FOR BONAPARTE AND CAESAR AND LET NERO TAKE HIS FIDDLE AND BE THE ORCHESTRA
2448-141428-0066 UNDER BARNUM'S MANAGEMENT YOU'D GET ENOUGH ACTIVITY IN ONE SEASON TO LAST YOU THROUGH ALL ETERNITY YOU CAN COUNT ON ME SAID BARNUM RISING LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR PLAN LAID OUT
2448-141428-0067 ADAM HAS PROMISED TO GIVE ME POINTS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF WILD ANIMALS WITHOUT CAGES SO I CAN'T WAIT BY BY HUMPH SAID SHAKESPEARE AS THE EMINENT SHOWMAN PASSED OUT THAT'S A GAY PROPOSITION
2448-141428-0068 WHEN MONKEYS MOVE IN POLITE SOCIETY
2448-141428-0069 THEY DO NOW SAID THACKERAY QUIETLY WHICH MERELY PROVED THAT SHAKESPEARE DID NOT MEAN WHAT HE SAID FOR IN SPITE OF THACKERAY'S INSINUATION AS TO THE MONKEYS AND POLITE SOCIETY
2448-141428-0070 HE HAS NOT YET ACCEPTED THE BARNUM PROPOSITION THOUGH THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF ITS VALUE
