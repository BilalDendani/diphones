6687-119386-0000 BUT IT DID NOT TAKE HIM LONG TO COME TO ONE CONCLUSION ON THE MATTER THAT HE HAD BEEN CAPTURED AT NIGHT THRUST INTO THE FRAIL BOAT AND SENT ADRIFT ON THE OCEAN WHO HAD BEEN THE AUTHORS OF THE JOB THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT IN HIS MIND ABOUT THAT
6687-119386-0001 THE GREYVILLES OR THE GREGGS AS HE BELIEVED THEY WERE WERE ANXIOUS TO HAVE HIM LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAD PROBABLY THROUGH THEIR AGENTS CAUSED HIS REMOVAL IN THIS VERY PROMISCUOUS MANNER
6687-119386-0002 BY AN EFFORT HE SAT UP IN THE LITTLE BOAT AND GAZED AROUND HIM HE WAS NOW SOME DISTANCE FROM THE BEACH BEYOND THE WHITE CAPPED BREAKERS
6687-119386-0003 AND AS THE TIDE WAS RECEDING THE FRAIL CRAFT WAS OF COURSE DRIFTING FARTHER AND FARTHER FROM LAND EACH MOMENT A REFLECTION THAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED ANY ONE A START WHILE TO FRITZ BOUND AND HELPLESS IT WAS THE NEXT THING TO BEING ALARMING
6687-119386-0004 WAS HIS EXCLAMATION AS HE GAZED DOLEFULLY AROUND HIM OFF I DON'D VAS IN A DUYFEL OFF A FIX DEN I DON'D VANT A CENT THEY'VE COME VON CUTE GAME OFER ME UND I'LL BET A HALF DOLLAR I GO DOWN DER SAME THROAT VOT JONAH DID DER W'ALE'S
6687-119386-0005 VONDER VICH VON OFF DEM VELLERS PUT UP DER SHOB ON ME I'D LIKE TO PUNCH HIS NOSE
6687-119386-0006 I VONDER VOT DER PLAZES A VELLER CAN DO ANYHOW THERE WAS A SORRY PROSPECT FOR HIS BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING MUCH TOWARD HELPING HIMSELF FROM THE UNENVIABLE SITUATION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN PLACED HE WAS UNABLE TO USE HIS HANDS OR FEET
6687-119386-0007 AND WAS THEREFORE HELPLESS AND AT THE MERCY OF THE WILD WATERS OVER WHICH HE WAS DRIFTING
6687-119386-0008 FOR THE BOAT WAS WITHOUT OARS AND THE DISTANCE TO THE LAND WAS SO GREAT AS TO MAKE IT A DARING ATTEMPT TO BREAST THE OUTGOING TIDE IN A STRUGGLE TO REACH THE SHORE BY SWIMMING
6687-119386-0009 AND HE WAS NOT THE ONE TO DESPAIR WITHOUT FIRST PROVING TO HIS SATISFACTION THAT IT WAS THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR HIM TO DO THEREFORE HE SET TO WORK INDUSTRIOUSLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO LOOSEN THE BONDS FROM HIS HANDS
6687-119386-0010 LUCKILY THEY WERE NOT BOUND BEHIND HIS BACK WHICH WAS ONE ADVANTAGE AS HE COULD USE HIS TEETH UPON THEM BUT BEING LEATHER STRAPS HE MADE SLOW HEADWAY NIBBLING AT THE STRAP AROUND HIS HAND BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE IT YIELDED
6687-119386-0011 SO THAT AFTER AWHILE A VIOLENT WRENCH BROKE IT ASUNDER AND HIS HANDS WERE FREE PY SHIMMINY DOT ISH GOOT ANYHOW HE MUTTERED MAKING HASTE TO UNLOOSEN HIS FEET NOW DER NEXT T'INGS IS SOMEDINGS ELSE
6687-119386-0012 HOW ISH I GOING TO GOT PACK MIT DER SHORE IT WAS AN ALL IMPORTANT QUESTION THE BOAT WAS PERHAPS A MILE FARTHER FROM SHORE THAN WHEN HE FIRST HAD ESTIMATED THE DISTANCE I DON'D KNOW VEDDER I CAN SWUM DOT FURDER OR NOT HE MUTTERED DOUBTFULLY
6687-119386-0013 BUT SUBBOSIN DER WHALE OR DER DUYFEL FISH
6687-119386-0014 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THESE REFLECTIONS WHEN HE HEARD A SHOUT FARTHER OUT AT SEA AND FOR THE FIRST TIME BEHELD DIMLY A DUSKY OBJECT FLOATING IN THE WATER NOT FAR AHEAD OF HIM HELLO
6687-119386-0015 I AM A POOR DEVIL MORE OR LESS DROWNED AND CAN'T HANG ON TO THIS BARREL MUCH LONGER BE YOU MAN OR DEVIL FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE HURRY ALONG WITH YOUR BOAT
6687-119386-0016 I VIL PE DERE IN DER SWEEDNESS PY UND PY KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP UND I'LL GOT YOU SOON THE YOUNG DETECTIVE REPLIED HEARTILY DERE'S NODDING LIKE HANG ON AT DER CRITICAL MINUTE
6687-119386-0017 KNEELING AND LEANING OVER THE FRONT PART OF THE BOAT HE USED HIS HANDS AS PROPELLERS AND IN THIS WAY WAS ABLE TO IMPROVE THE SLOW PROGRESS OF HIS LIGHT CRAFT TO SOME EXTENT AND IN A FEW MOMENTS WAS ALONGSIDE THE BARREL
6687-119386-0018 ON TOP OF WHICH A DRENCHED HUMAN WAS BALANCING HIMSELF AT A GLANCE FRITZ PERCEIVED WHO IT WAS HARTLY HE EXCLAIMED IN SURPRISE YES WHAT'S LEFT OF ME THE SENTENCED SMUGGLER REPLIED CLAMBERING INTO THE BOAT
6687-119386-0019 THANK HEAVEN YOU CAME ALONG JUST AS YOU DID FOR MY GRIPE WOULDN'T HOLD OUT MUCH LONGER VEL I SHOULD DINK NOT I'D GIFFEN YOU UP ASH DEAD
6687-119386-0020 HARTLY REPLIED GRIMLY THEY CHUCKED ME UNDER NIGHT AFORE LAST MILES OUT AT SEA SUPPOSING MY HANDS AND FEET WERE BOUND AND A HEAVY STONE TIED TO MY HEAD
6687-119386-0021 BUT WHILE THEY WERE ROWING ME OUT I CONTRIVED TO LOOSEN UP MATTERS SO THAT I WAS REALLY FREE THE MINUTE I STRUCK WATER BUT I WENT UNDER ALL THE SAME TO DECEIVE THEM WHEN THEY HEADED FOR SHORE I AROSE TO THE SURFACE AND AFTER SWIMMING ABOUT UNTIL NEARLY EXHAUSTED
6687-119386-0022 I CAUGHT ONTO THIS EMPTY CASK WHICH HAS IN ONE SENSE BEEN MY SALVATION
6687-119386-0023 AND THE OUTGOING TIDE HAS CARRIED ME OUT AGAIN NOT SO FAR AS IT WOULD HOWEVER IF I HAD NOT STRUGGLED SHOREWARD CONSTANTLY
6687-119386-0024 FRITZ EXPLAINED AS FAR AS HE HAD KNOWN AND HARTLY SCOWLED THERE'LL BE A RECKONING FOR SOME ONE HE SAID IF I EVER SUCCEED IN GETTING ASHORE BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH PROSPECT OF THAT UNLESS WE CAN GET SOME OARS OR SOMETHING TO PULL ASHORE WITH
6687-119386-0025 THE TIDE WILL BEGIN TO EBB IN BEFORE A GREAT WHILE TOO I HAFF VON IDEA FRITZ SAID UFF VE CAN GOT DER PARREL APART WE MIGHT DO SOMEDINGS VID DER STAVES
6687-119386-0026 GOOD IDEA WE CAN EASILY GET THE STAVES
6687-119386-0027 NOW THEN FOR SHORE HE CRIED WHEN WE GET THERE I WILL LEAVE YOU ON BUSINESS FOR A FEW HOURS AFTER WHICH I WILL JOIN YOU AND WE WILL WORK TOGETHER AGAINST THE GREGG GANG WE WILL PADDLE TO LAND ON THE LOWER SIDE OF THE BLUFF
6687-119386-0028 AS IT WOULDN'T BE PARTICULARLY HEALTHY FOR ME TO LAND IN FRONT OF THE VILLAGE YOU CAN AND IN FACT HAD BETTER KEEP SHADY IN THE VICINITY OF THE OLD ROOKERY ON THE BLUFF AND I WILL JOIN YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
6687-119386-0029 ACCORDINGLY THEY PADDLED AS RAPIDLY TOWARD THE BEACH AS THEIR STRENGTH WOULD PERMIT BY THE TIME IT WAS DAYBREAK THEY HAD LANDED BELOW THE BLUFF HERE THEY DREW THE LIGHT BOAT UP ON THE BEACH AND HARTLY SAID I'LL LEAVE YOU NOW BUT WILL RETURN IN THE COURSE OF A FEW HOURS
6687-119386-0030 FRITZ REPLIED AND THEN THE YOUNG SMUGGLER CLAMBERED UP THE SIDE OF THE BLUFF AND WAS SOON GONE FROM VIEW I VONDER VOT DOT VELLER ISH OOP TO NOW
6687-119386-0031 DER IS SOMET'ING HE VAS GOIN TO DO
6687-119386-0032 I HAVE HAFF A NOTION DOT HE AIN'D VOS SO NICE A VELLER VOT I FIRSD T'OUGHT UND I VOULDN'T PE MUCH SURPRISED IF HE VOULD GIVE ME AVAY OFF HE GOT A CHANCE
6687-119386-0033 IN DER MEANTIME DER IS SOMET'ING I VANT TO INVESTIGATE THIS WAS SOMETHING HE HAD NOTICED AS HE AND HARTLY HAD PADDLED IN TO THE SHORE FROM THE OCEAN
6687-119386-0034 IN ABOUT THE CENTER OF THE BLUFF AT THE WATER'S EDGE AS IT FACED THE OPEN ATLANTIC WAS A DARK HOLE OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT MIGHT LEAD TO A CAVERN IN THE HILL IF HARTLY KNEW OF ITS EXISTENCE HE HAD KEPT IT A SECRET
6687-119386-0035 BUT OUR GERMAN DETECTIVE HAD NOTICED IT AND RESOLVED TO SEE WHERE THE APERTURE LED TO UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN IT A SECOND THOUGHT
6687-119386-0036 BUT THE FACT THAT THE SMUGGLERS HELD OUT IN THIS VICINITY OF WHICH HE NOW HAD NO DOUBT GAVE THAT HOLE IN THE BLUFF MORE THAN ORDINARY SIGNIFICANCE JUMPING INTO THE BOAT HE PADDLED OFF ONCE MORE INTO THE WATER AND HEADED TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE BLUFF
6687-119386-0037 NOT KNOWING WHAT DANGER HE MIGHT UNEXPECTEDLY RUN INTO HE HAD DRAWN HIS REVOLVER WHICH STRANGELY ENOUGH HIS CAPTORS HAD NOT TAKEN FROM HIM AND PLACED IT ON THE STERN SEAT BESIDE HIM WORKING SILENTLY BUT STEADILY ALONG THE FACE OF THE BLUFF
6687-119386-0038 WHICH WAS QUITE PERPENDICULAR HE SOON CAME BEFORE THE APERTURE AND HEADED HIS BOAT INTO IT
6687-119386-0039 SAT IN HIS PRIVATE STUDY THIS SAME MORNING ENGAGED IN SMOKING A CIGAR AS HE ROCKED IN AN EASY CHAIR AND GAZED OUT THROUGH AN OPEN GLASS DOOR UPON THE PRETTY LAWN THAT HIS THOUGHTS WERE OF AN UNPLEASANT NATURE WAS EVIDENT BY A FROWN WHICH DISFIGURED HIS FLORID COUNTENANCE
6687-119386-0040 AND THIS FROWN DID NOT LESSEN BUT RATHER INCREASED AS THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY NO LESS A WILD LOOKING PERSONAGE THAN SILLY SUE WHOM FRITZ HAD ENCOUNTERED UPON THE BEACH
