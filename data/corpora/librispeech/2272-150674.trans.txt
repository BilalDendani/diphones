2272-150674-0000 WORSHIP AND PERSECUTION OF IMAGES REVOLT OF ITALY AND ROME TEMPORAL DOMINION OF THE POPES CONQUEST OF ITALY BY THE FRANKS ESTABLISHMENT OF IMAGES CHARACTER AND CORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE
2272-150674-0001 RESTORATION AND DECAY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE WEST INDEPENDENCE OF ITALY CONSTITUTION OF THE GERMANIC BODY IN THE CONNECTION OF THE CHURCH AND STATE I HAVE CONSIDERED THE FORMER AS SUBSERVIENT ONLY AND RELATIVE TO THE LATTER
2272-150674-0002 IN THE PEACE AND LUXURY OF THE TRIUMPHANT CHURCH THE MORE PRUDENT BISHOPS CONDESCENDED TO INDULGE A VISIBLE SUPERSTITION FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE MULTITUDE AND AFTER THE RUIN OF PAGANISM THEY WERE NO LONGER RESTRAINED BY THE APPREHENSION OF AN ODIOUS PARALLEL
2272-150674-0003 THE FIRST INTRODUCTION OF A SYMBOLIC WORSHIP WAS IN THE VENERATION OF THE CROSS AND OF RELICS THE SAINTS AND MARTYRS WHOSE INTERCESSION WAS IMPLORED
2272-150674-0004 BUT THE GRACIOUS AND OFTEN SUPERNATURAL FAVORS WHICH IN THE POPULAR BELIEF WERE SHOWERED ROUND THEIR TOMB CONVEYED AN UNQUESTIONABLE SANCTION OF THE DEVOUT PILGRIMS WHO VISITED AND TOUCHED AND KISSED THESE LIFELESS REMAINS
2272-150674-0005 MORE INTERESTING THAN THE SKULL OR THE SANDALS OF A DEPARTED WORTHY IS THE FAITHFUL COPY OF HIS PERSON AND FEATURES DELINEATED BY THE ARTS OF PAINTING OR SCULPTURE IN EVERY AGE SUCH COPIES SO CONGENIAL TO HUMAN FEELINGS
2272-150674-0006 HAVE BEEN CHERISHED BY THE ZEAL OF PRIVATE FRIENDSHIP OR PUBLIC ESTEEM THE IMAGES OF THE ROMAN EMPERORS WERE ADORED WITH CIVIL AND ALMOST RELIGIOUS HONORS A REVERENCE LESS OSTENTATIOUS BUT MORE SINCERE WAS APPLIED TO THE STATUES OF SAGES AND PATRIOTS
2272-150674-0007 AND THESE PROFANE VIRTUES THESE SPLENDID SINS DISAPPEARED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY MEN WHO HAD DIED FOR THEIR CELESTIAL AND EVERLASTING COUNTRY AT FIRST THE EXPERIMENT WAS MADE WITH CAUTION AND SCRUPLE
2272-150674-0008 AND THE VENERABLE PICTURES WERE DISCREETLY ALLOWED TO INSTRUCT THE IGNORANT TO AWAKEN THE COLD AND TO GRATIFY THE PREJUDICES OF THE HEATHEN PROSELYTES BY A SLOW THOUGH INEVITABLE PROGRESSION THE HONORS OF THE ORIGINAL WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE COPY
2272-150674-0009 THE DEVOUT CHRISTIAN PRAYED BEFORE THE IMAGE OF A SAINT AND THE PAGAN RITES OF GENUFLECTION LUMINARIES AND INCENSE AGAIN STOLE INTO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THE SCRUPLES OF REASON OR PIETY WERE SILENCED BY THE STRONG EVIDENCE OF VISIONS AND MIRACLES AND THE PICTURES WHICH SPEAK
2272-150674-0010 AND MOVE AND BLEED MUST BE ENDOWED WITH A DIVINE ENERGY AND MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE PROPER OBJECTS OF RELIGIOUS ADORATION THE MOST AUDACIOUS PENCIL MIGHT TREMBLE IN THE RASH ATTEMPT OF DEFINING BY FORMS AND COLORS THE INFINITE SPIRIT THE ETERNAL FATHER
2272-150674-0011 AND ABOVE ALL THE SON OF GOD UNDER THE HUMAN SHAPE WHICH ON EARTH THEY HAVE CONDESCENDED TO ASSUME THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY HAD BEEN CLOTHED WITH A REAL AND MORTAL BODY BUT THAT BODY HAD ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN AND HAD NOT SOME SIMILITUDE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE EYES OF HIS DISCIPLES
2272-150674-0012 FROM WHENCE AFTER AN OBLIVION OF FIVE HUNDRED YEARS IT WAS RELEASED BY SOME PRUDENT BISHOP AND SEASONABLY PRESENTED TO THE DEVOTION OF THE TIMES ITS FIRST AND MOST GLORIOUS EXPLOIT
2272-150674-0013 AND IT WAS SOON REVERED AS A PLEDGE OF THE DIVINE PROMISE THAT EDESSA SHOULD NEVER BE TAKEN BY A FOREIGN ENEMY IT IS TRUE INDEED THAT THE TEXT OF PROCOPIUS ASCRIBES THE DOUBLE DELIVERANCE OF EDESSA TO THE WEALTH AND VALOR OF HER CITIZENS WHO PURCHASED THE ABSENCE AND REPELLED THE ASSAULTS OF THE PERSIAN MONARCH
2272-150674-0014 HE WAS IGNORANT THE PROFANE HISTORIAN OF THE TESTIMONY WHICH HE IS COMPELLED TO DELIVER IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL PAGE OF EVAGRIUS THAT THE PALLADIUM WAS EXPOSED ON THE RAMPART AND THAT THE WATER WHICH HAD BEEN SPRINKLED ON THE HOLY FACE INSTEAD OF QUENCHING
2272-150674-0015 ADDED NEW FUEL TO THE FLAMES OF THE BESIEGED AFTER THIS IMPORTANT SERVICE THE IMAGE OF EDESSA WAS PRESERVED WITH RESPECT AND GRATITUDE AND IF THE ARMENIANS REJECTED THE LEGEND THE MORE CREDULOUS GREEKS ADORED THE SIMILITUDE WHICH WAS NOT THE WORK OF ANY MORTAL PENCIL
2272-150674-0016 BUT THE IMMEDIATE CREATION OF THE DIVINE ORIGINAL THE STYLE AND SENTIMENTS OF A BYZANTINE HYMN WILL DECLARE HOW FAR THEIR WORSHIP WAS REMOVED FROM THE GROSSEST IDOLATRY HOW CAN WE WITH MORTAL EYES CONTEMPLATE THIS IMAGE WHOSE CELESTIAL SPLENDOR THE HOST OF HEAVEN PRESUMES NOT TO BEHOLD
2272-150674-0017 HE WHO DWELLS IN HEAVEN CONDESCENDS THIS DAY TO VISIT US BY HIS VENERABLE IMAGE HE WHO IS SEATED ON THE CHERUBIM VISITS US THIS DAY BY A PICTURE WHICH THE FATHER HAS DELINEATED WITH HIS IMMACULATE HAND WHICH HE HAS FORMED IN AN INEFFABLE MANNER
2272-150674-0018 AND DEPRECIATE THEIR AUTHORITY BUT THE TRIUMPHANT MUSSULMANS WHO REIGNED AT DAMASCUS AND THREATENED CONSTANTINOPLE CAST INTO THE SCALE OF REPROACH THE ACCUMULATED WEIGHT OF TRUTH AND VICTORY THE CITIES OF SYRIA PALESTINE AND EGYPT
2272-150674-0019 HAD BEEN FORTIFIED WITH THE IMAGES OF CHRIST HIS MOTHER AND HIS SAINTS AND EACH CITY PRESUMED ON THE HOPE OR PROMISE OF MIRACULOUS DEFENCE IN A RAPID CONQUEST OF TEN YEARS THE ARABS SUBDUED THOSE CITIES AND THESE IMAGES AND IN THEIR OPINION
2272-150674-0020 BUT THE CHOSEN CITY THE SPOUSE OF CHRIST WAS INVOLVED IN THE COMMON RUIN AND HIS DIVINE RESEMBLANCE BECAME THE SLAVE AND TROPHY OF THE INFIDELS
