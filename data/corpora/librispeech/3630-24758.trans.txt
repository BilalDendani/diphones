3630-24758-0000 AND THE BODY IS AFFECTED IN THE SAME MANNER WHEREFORE IN SO FAR AS THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE THING IS STRONG A MAN IS DETERMINED TO REGARD IT WITH PAIN
3630-24758-0001 THIS DETERMINATION WHILE THE IMAGE OF THE THING IN QUESTION LASTS IS INDEED CHECKED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF OTHER THINGS EXCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF THE AFORESAID THING BUT IS NOT DESTROYED HENCE A MAN ONLY FEELS PLEASURE IN SO FAR AS THE SAID DETERMINATION IS CHECKED
3630-24758-0002 FOR THIS REASON THE JOY ARISING FROM THE INJURY DONE TO WHAT WE HATE IS REPEATED EVERY TIME WE REMEMBER THAT OBJECT OF HATRED FOR AS WE HAVE SAID WHEN THE IMAGE OF THE THING IN QUESTION IS AROUSED INASMUCH AS IT INVOLVES THE THING'S EXISTENCE
3630-24758-0003 IT DETERMINES THE MAN TO REGARD THE THING WITH THE SAME PAIN AS HE WAS WONT TO DO WHEN IT ACTUALLY DID EXIST HOWEVER SINCE HE HAS JOINED TO THE IMAGE OF THE THING OTHER IMAGES WHICH EXCLUDE ITS EXISTENCE THIS DETERMINATION TO PAIN IS FORTHWITH CHECKED
3630-24758-0004 AND THE MAN REJOICES AFRESH AS OFTEN AS THE REPETITION TAKES PLACE THIS IS THE CAUSE OF MEN'S PLEASURE IN RECALLING PAST EVILS AND DELIGHT IN NARRATING DANGERS FROM WHICH THEY HAVE ESCAPED FOR WHEN MEN CONCEIVE A DANGER THEY CONCEIVE IT AS STILL FUTURE AND ARE DETERMINED TO FEAR IT
3630-24758-0005 THIS RENDERS THEM SECURE AFRESH THEREFORE THEY REJOICE AFRESH
3630-24758-0006 MUST OTHER CONDITIONS BEING SIMILAR BE GREATER THAN IF IT WERE FELT TOWARDS A THING ACTING BY NECESSITY
3630-24758-0007 MOREOVER WE ARE APT TO ESTIMATE SUCH OBJECTS ABOVE OR BELOW THEIR TRUE VALUE
3630-24758-0008 HOWEVER I DO NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO POINT OUT HERE THE VACILLATIONS SPRINGING FROM HOPE AND FEAR IT FOLLOWS FROM THE DEFINITION OF THESE EMOTIONS THAT THERE CAN BE NO HOPE WITHOUT FEAR AND NO FEAR WITHOUT HOPE AS I WILL DULY EXPLAIN IN THE PROPER PLACE
3630-24758-0009 FURTHER IN SO FAR AS WE HOPE FOR OR FEAR ANYTHING WE REGARD IT WITH LOVE OR HATRED
