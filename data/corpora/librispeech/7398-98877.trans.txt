7398-98877-0000 IN THE AMERICAN PROVINGS APIS IS INDICATED IN THIS DISEASE BY THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
7398-98877-0001 TWELVE EIGHTEEN MEASLE SHAPED ERUPTION IF WE ADD TO THESE SYMPTOMS THE PECULIARITY INHERENT IN APIS TO CAUSE CATARRHAL IRRITATIONS OF THE EYES SUCH AS OCCUR DURING MEASLES
7398-98877-0002 AND GENERALLY GET WELL WITHOUT ANY PREJUDICE TO THE GENERAL HEALTH NEVERTHELESS CASES OCCUR WHERE INTENSE OPHTHALMIA A VIOLENT AND RACKING COUGH AND THE PHENOMENA WHICH APPERTAIN TO IT AN INTENSE IRRITATION OF THE INTERNAL MUCOUS MEMBRANE
7398-98877-0003 DANGEROUS PROSTRATION OF STRENGTH
7398-98877-0004 RENDER THE INTERFERENCE OF ART DESIRABLE
7398-98877-0005 BUT LIKEWISE FROM THE EFFECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN WITNESSED UNDER THE OPERATION OF OTHER MEDICINES IN ORDINARY CASES AND WITHOUT TREATMENT IT TAKES THREE FIVE SEVEN AND ELEVEN DAYS BEFORE THE EYES GET WELL AGAIN
7398-98877-0006 BUT UNDER THE USE OF APIS THE EYES IMPROVE SO DECIDEDLY IN FROM ONE TO THREE DAYS THAT THE EYES DO NOT REQUIRE ANY FURTHER TREATMENT AND THAT EVEN TROUBLESOME SEQUELAE SUCH AS PHOTOPHOBIA STYES WHICH COME AND GO
7398-98877-0007 TROUBLESOME LACHRYMATION CONTINUAL REDNESS
7398-98877-0008 FISTULAE LACHRYMALIS ET CETERA NEED NOT BE APPREHENDED
7398-98877-0009 WE HEAR NOTHING OF THE TROUBLESOME AND OFTEN SO WEARING AND RACKING COUGH WHICH SO OFTEN PREVAILS IN MEASLES AND THE CONTINUANCE OF WHICH IS ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASED IRRITATION AND SWELLING OF THE RESPIRATORY MUCOUS MEMBRANE
7398-98877-0010 WHICH RECURS IN PAROXYSMS ASSUMES A SUSPICIOUS SOUND SHOWS A TENDENCY TO CROUP AND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS AND FINALLY DEGENERATES IN WHOOPING COUGH
7398-98877-0011 SO THAT EPIDEMIC MEASLES AND WHOOPING COUGH OFTEN GO HAND IN HAND AFTER APIS THE COUGH SPEEDILY BEGINS TO BECOME LOOSER AND MILDER
7398-98877-0012 AND TO GRADUALLY DISAPPEAR WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE BEHIND IF THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE CONFIRMED BY FURTHER EXPERIENCE WE WOULD HAVE ATTAINED ADDITIONAL MEANS OF PREVENTING THE SUPERVENTION OF WHOOPING COUGH IN MEASLES
7398-98877-0013 A TRIUMPH OF ART AND SCIENCE WHICH SHOULD ELICIT OUR WARMEST GRATITUDE ANY ONE WHO KNOWS HOW MALIGNANT MEASLES UNASSISTED BY ART ARE ACCOMPANIED BY DEEP SEATED IRRITATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS
7398-98877-0014 TO SOPOR HOW THEY THREATEN LIFE BY LONG LASTING AND TROUBLESOME PUTRID AND TYPHOID FEVERS AND HOW IF THEY DO NOT TERMINATE FATALLY THEY RESULT IN SLOW CONVALESCENCE AND SOMETIMES IN CHRONIC MALADIES FOR LIFE WILL ADMIT
7398-98877-0015 ON BEHOLDING THE QUIET SLEEP WHICH PATIENTS ENJOY THE PLEASANT AND GENERAL PERSPIRATION THE RETURN OF APPETITE THE INCREASE OF STRENGTH AND THE COMPLETE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALL PUTRID AND TYPHOID SYMPTOMS
7398-98877-0016 IF AFTER USING THE ACONITE THE ERUPTION BREAKS OUT AND THE FEVER ABATES NO FURTHER MEDICATION IS NECESSARY IF FEVER AND ERUPTION SHOULD REQUIRE FURTHER AID
7398-98877-0017 WELL SHAKEN A DESSERT SPOONFUL MORNING AND EVENING OR IF THE DISEASE IS VERY ACUTE EVERY THREE HOURS WHICH TREATMENT IS TO BE CONTINUED UNTIL AN IMPROVEMENT SETS IN AFTER WHICH THE NATURAL REACTION OF THE ORGANISM WILL TERMINATE THE CURE
7398-98877-0018 SEQUELAE SELDOM TAKE PLACE AFTER THIS KIND OF TREATMENT
7398-98877-0019 IN URTICARIA AND PEMPHIGUS APIS WILL LIKEWISE AFFORD SPEEDY AND CERTAIN HELP MANY SYMPTOMS IN THE AMERICAN PROVINGS CONFIRM THIS STATEMENT MORE PARTICULARLY ELEVEN NINETY EIGHT TO TWELVE TEN AND TWELVE THIRTY TWO TO THIRTY FIVE
7398-98877-0020 VERY SOON THICK NETTLE RASH OVER THE WHOLE BODY ITCHING A GOOD DEAL PASSING OFF AFTER SLEEPING SOUNDLY VIOLENT INFLAMMATION AND PRESSURE OVER THE WHOLE BODY FRICTION BROUGHT OUT SMALL WHITE SPOTS RESEMBLING MUSQUITO BITES
7398-98877-0021 SUDDENLY AN INDESCRIBABLE STINGING SENSATION OVER THE WHOLE BODY WITH WHITE AND RED SPOTS IN THE PALMS OF THE HANDS ON THE ARMS AND FEET HER WHOLE BODY WAS COVERED WITH ITCHING AND BURNING SWOLLEN STREAKS AFTER WHICH THE OTHER TROUBLES DISAPPEARED SWELLING OF THE FACE AND BODY
7398-98877-0022 THE PARTS ARE COVERED WITH A SORT OF BLOTCHES SOMEWHAT PALER THAN THE ORDINARY COLOR OF THE SKIN ERUPTION OVER THE WHOLE BODY RESEMBLING NETTLE RASH WITH ITCHING AND BURNING NETTLE RASH IN MANY CASES SPOTS ON THE NAPE OF THE NECK AND FOREHEAD RESEMBLING NETTLE RASH UNDER THE SKIN
7398-98877-0023 CONSEQUENCES OF REPELLED URTICARIA WHITISH VIOLENTLY ITCHING SWELLINGS OF THE SKIN ON THE HEAD AND NAPE OF THE NECK LIKE NETTLE RASH AFTER THE RASH DISAPPEARED THE WHOLE OF THE RIGHT SIDE WAS PARALYZED WITH VIOLENT DELIRIUM EVEN UNTO RAGE
7398-98877-0024 BUT SO FAR IT HAS BEEN SOUGHT FOR IN VAIN THE SAME PHYSICIAN SPEAKING OF PEMPHIGUS WRITES IN THE SAME PLACE THAT ITS ETIOLOGY PROGNOSIS AND TREATMENT ARE STILL VERY DUBIOUS
7398-98877-0025 CHARACTERIZED BY SOME SPECIFIC CHRONIC MIASM OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MOST PENETRATING AND DISTURBING EMOTIONS SUCH AS FRIGHT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES THE MORE FREQUENTLY WE OBSERVE THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF SUCH PUSTULES
7398-98877-0026 DURING THE PERIOD OF ORGANIC VIGOR SEEMS TO BE A SORT OF TRIFLING DERANGEMENT SOMEWHAT LIKE URTICARIA BUT WHICH AS THE VITAL ENERGIES BECOME PROSTRATED BY AGE BECOMES MORE AND MORE SEARCHING AND TORMENTING
7398-98877-0027 EXHAUSTING THE VITAL JUICES AND LEADING IRRESISTIBLY TO A FATAL TERMINATION A RESULT WHICH IS PARTICULARLY APT TO TAKE PLACE DURING OLD AGE ALTHOUGH I HAVE LIKEWISE OBSERVED IT BUT RARELY AMONG NEW BORN INFANTS
7398-98877-0028 THESE DEVELOPMENTS LEAD US TO SUSPECT THAT URTICARIA AND PEMPHIGUS ARE IDENTICAL IN ESSENCE
7398-98877-0029 IN EITHER CASE IF THE VITAL FORCES ARE PROSTRATED AND THE SENSITIVENESS OF THE ORGANIC REACTION IS CONSIDERABLE
7398-98877-0030 IF THE IMPROVEMENT CEASE OR THE ERUPTION SHOULD REAPPEAR WE HAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE IMPROVEMENT WILL NOT SPEEDILY RESUME ITS COURSE OR WHETHER THE ERUPTION DOES NOT SHOW ITSELF MORE FEEBLY THAN BEFORE
7398-98877-0031 OR IF THE CURE IS NOT EVIDENCED BY SOME OTHER FAVORABLE CHANGE IN THE FORMER CASE THE MEDICINE SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO ACT STILL FURTHER
7398-98877-0032 IN ALL BENIGN CASES MORE PARTICULARLY IF NO OTHER MEANS OF TREATMENT HAD BEEN RESORTED TO BEFORE THIS MANAGEMENT WILL SUFFICE IF THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE IF THE ERUPTION SHOULD APPEAR AGAIN WE MAY REST ASSURED THAT A PSORIC MIASM LURKS IN THE ORGANISM
7398-98877-0033 AND THAT AN ANTI PSORIC TREATMENT HAS TO BE RESORTED TO THE BEST ANTI PSORIC UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS SULPHUR THIRTY ONE PELLET PROVIDED THIS DRUG HAS NOT YET BEEN ABUSED OR CAUSTICUM THIRTY ONE PELLET IF SUCH AN ABUSE HAS TAKEN PLACE
7398-98877-0034 SYPHILIS MAY LIKEWISE COMPLICATE THE DISEASE IN WHICH CASE MERCURIUS THIRTY ONE PELLET MAY BE GIVEN OR IF MERCURY HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY TAKEN IN EXCESSIVE DOSES MERCURIUS SIX THOUSAND ONE GLOBULE
