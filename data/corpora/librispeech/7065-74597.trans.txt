7065-74597-0000 ORANGES AND YELLOWS IF THEY BE PURE AND INTENSE ARE MOST PROBABLY OF THE SECOND ORDER THOSE OF THE FIRST AND THIRD ORDER ALSO MAY BE PRETTY GOOD ONLY THE YELLOW OF THE FIRST ORDER IS FAINT AND THE ORANGE AND RED OF THE THIRD ORDER
7065-74597-0001 HAVE A GREAT MIXTURE OF VIOLET AND BLUE THERE MAY BE GOOD GREENS OF THE FOURTH ORDER BUT THE PUREST ARE OF THE THIRD
7065-74597-0002 AND PARTLY BECAUSE WHEN THEY WITHER SOME OF THEM TURN TO A GREENISH YELLOW AND OTHERS TO A MORE PERFECT YELLOW OR ORANGE OR PERHAPS TO RED
7065-74597-0003 WHICH CHANGES SEEM TO BE EFFECTED BY THE EXHALING OF THE MOISTURE WHICH MAY LEAVE THE TINGING CORPUSCLES MORE DENSE AND SOMETHING AUGMENTED BY THE ACCRETION OF THE OILY AND EARTHY PART OF THAT MOISTURE NOW THE GREEN WITHOUT DOUBT
7065-74597-0004 YET ARE OFTEN TOO FULL AND LIVELY TO BE OF THE FOURTH ORDER BLUES AND PURPLES MAY BE EITHER OF THE SECOND OR THIRD ORDER BUT THE BEST ARE OF THE THIRD THUS THE COLOUR OF VIOLETS SEEMS TO BE OF THAT ORDER
7065-74597-0005 BECAUSE THEIR SYRUP BY ACID LIQUORS TURNS RED AND BY URINOUS AND ALCALIZATE TURNS GREEN FOR SINCE IT IS OF THE NATURE OF ACIDS TO DISSOLVE OR ATTENUATE AND OF
7065-74597-0006 WAS OF THE SECOND ORDER AN ACID LIQUOR BY ATTENUATING ITS TINGING CORPUSCLES WOULD CHANGE IT TO A RED OF THE FIRST ORDER
7065-74597-0007 BY INCRASSATING THEM WOULD CHANGE IT TO A GREEN OF THE SECOND ORDER
7065-74597-0008 BUT IF THE SAID PURPLE BE SUPPOSED OF THE THIRD ORDER ITS CHANGE TO RED OF THE SECOND AND GREEN OF THE THIRD MAY WITHOUT ANY INCONVENIENCE BE ALLOW'D IF THERE BE FOUND ANY BODY
7065-74597-0009 OF A DEEPER AND LESS REDDISH PURPLE THAN THAT OF THE VIOLETS
7065-74597-0010 BUT YET THERE BEING NO BODY COMMONLY KNOWN WHOSE COLOUR IS CONSTANTLY MORE DEEP THAN THEIRS I HAVE MADE USE OF THEIR NAME TO DENOTE THE DEEPEST AND LEAST REDDISH PURPLES SUCH AS MANIFESTLY TRANSCEND THEIR COLOUR IN PURITY
7065-74597-0011 THE BLUE OF THE FIRST ORDER THOUGH VERY FAINT AND LITTLE MAY POSSIBLY BE THE COLOUR OF SOME SUBSTANCES AND PARTICULARLY THE AZURE COLOUR OF THE SKIES SEEMS TO BE OF THIS ORDER
7065-74597-0012 FOR ALL VAPOURS WHEN THEY BEGIN TO CONDENSE AND COALESCE INTO SMALL PARCELS BECOME FIRST OF THAT BIGNESS
7065-74597-0013 AND SO THIS BEING THE FIRST COLOUR WHICH VAPOURS BEGIN TO REFLECT IT OUGHT TO BE THE COLOUR OF THE FINEST AND MOST TRANSPARENT SKIES IN WHICH VAPOURS ARE NOT ARRIVED
7065-74597-0014 AS WE FIND IT IS BY EXPERIENCE WHITENESS IF MOST INTENSE AND LUMINOUS IS THAT OF THE FIRST ORDER IF LESS STRONG AND LUMINOUS A MIXTURE OF THE COLOURS OF SEVERAL ORDERS
7065-74597-0015 OF THIS LAST KIND IS THE WHITENESS OF FROTH PAPER LINNEN AND MOST WHITE SUBSTANCES OF THE FORMER I RECKON THAT OF WHITE METALS TO BE FOR WHILST THE DENSEST OF METALS GOLD
7065-74597-0016 IF FOLIATED IS TRANSPARENT AND ALL METALS BECOME TRANSPARENT IF DISSOLVED IN MENSTRUUMS OR VITRIFIED
7065-74597-0017 FROM THEIR DENSITY ALONE THEY BEING LESS DENSE THAN GOLD
7065-74597-0018 DID NOT SOME OTHER CAUSE CONCUR WITH THEIR DENSITY TO MAKE THEM OPAKE AND THIS CAUSE
7065-74597-0019 AS FITS THEM TO REFLECT THE WHITE OF THE FIRST ORDER
7065-74597-0020 WHICH APPEAR UPON HOT STEEL IN TEMPERING IT AND SOMETIMES UPON THE SURFACE OF MELTED METALS IN THE SKIN OR SCORIA WHICH ARISES UPON THEM IN THEIR COOLING AND AS THE WHITE OF THE FIRST ORDER IS THE STRONGEST
7065-74597-0021 WHICH CAN BE MADE BY PLATES OF TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCES SO IT OUGHT TO BE STRONGER IN THE DENSER SUBSTANCES OF METALS THAN IN THE RARER OF AIR WATER AND GLASS NOR DO I SEE BUT THAT METALLICK SUBSTANCES
7065-74597-0022 OF SUCH A THICKNESS AS MAY FIT THEM TO REFLECT THE WHITE OF THE FIRST ORDER MAY BY REASON OF THEIR GREAT DENSITY ACCORDING TO THE TENOR OF THE FIRST OF THESE PROPOSITIONS REFLECT ALL THE LIGHT INCIDENT UPON THEM AND SO BE AS OPAKE
7065-74597-0023 AND SPLENDENT AS IT'S POSSIBLE FOR ANY BODY TO BE GOLD OR COPPER MIX'D WITH LESS THAN HALF THEIR WEIGHT OF SILVER OR TIN OR REGULUS OF ANTIMONY
7065-74597-0024 WHICH SHEWS BOTH THAT THE PARTICLES OF WHITE METALS
7065-74597-0025 AND SO ARE SMALLER THAN THOSE OF GOLD AND COPPER AND ALSO THAT THEY ARE SO OPAKE AS NOT TO SUFFER THE PARTICLES OF GOLD OR COPPER TO SHINE THROUGH THEM NOW IT IS SCARCE TO BE DOUBTED
7065-74597-0026 AND THEREFORE THE PARTICLES OF WHITE METALS CANNOT BE MUCH BIGGER THAN IS REQUISITE TO MAKE THEM REFLECT THE WHITE OF THE FIRST ORDER THE VOLATILITY OF MERCURY ARGUES THAT THEY ARE NOT MUCH BIGGER
7065-74597-0027 NOR MAY THEY BE MUCH LESS LEST THEY LOSE THEIR OPACITY AND BECOME EITHER TRANSPARENT AS THEY DO WHEN ATTENUATED BY VITRIFICATION OR BY SOLUTION IN MENSTRUUMS OR BLACK AS THEY DO WHEN GROUND SMALLER
7065-74597-0028 BY RUBBING SILVER OR TIN OR LEAD UPON OTHER SUBSTANCES TO DRAW BLACK LINES THE FIRST AND ONLY COLOUR WHICH WHITE METALS TAKE BY GRINDING THEIR PARTICLES SMALLER IS BLACK AND THEREFORE THEIR WHITE
7065-74597-0029 THAT IS THE WHITE OF THE FIRST ORDER BUT IF YOU WOULD HENCE GATHER THE BIGNESS OF METALLICK PARTICLES YOU MUST ALLOW FOR THEIR DENSITY FOR WERE MERCURY TRANSPARENT ITS DENSITY IS SUCH THAT THE SINE OF INCIDENCE UPON IT
7065-74597-0030 BY MY COMPUTATION WOULD BE TO THE SINE OF ITS REFRACTION AS SEVENTY ONE TO TWENTY OR SEVEN TO TWO AND THEREFORE THE THICKNESS OF ITS PARTICLES
7065-74597-0031 OUGHT TO BE LESS THAN THE THICKNESS OF THE SKIN OF THOSE BUBBLES IN THE PROPORTION OF TWO TO SEVEN WHENCE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE PARTICLES OF MERCURY MAY BE AS LITTLE AS THE PARTICLES OF SOME TRANSPARENT AND VOLATILE FLUIDS
7065-74597-0032 AND YET REFLECT THE WHITE OF THE FIRST ORDER LASTLY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BLACK THE CORPUSCLES MUST BE LESS THAN ANY OF THOSE WHICH EXHIBIT COLOURS FOR AT ALL GREATER SIZES THERE IS TOO MUCH LIGHT REFLECTED TO CONSTITUTE THIS COLOUR
7065-74597-0033 BUT IF THEY BE SUPPOSED A LITTLE LESS THAN IS REQUISITE TO REFLECT THE WHITE AND VERY FAINT BLUE OF THE FIRST ORDER THEY WILL ACCORDING TO THE FOURTH EIGHTH SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH OBSERVATIONS
7065-74597-0034 REFLECT SO VERY LITTLE LIGHT AS TO APPEAR INTENSELY BLACK AND YET MAY PERHAPS VARIOUSLY REFRACT IT TO AND FRO WITHIN THEMSELVES SO LONG UNTIL IT HAPPEN TO BE STIFLED AND LOST BY WHICH MEANS THEY WILL APPEAR BLACK IN ALL POSITIONS OF THE EYE
7065-74597-0035 WITHOUT ANY TRANSPARENCY AND FROM HENCE MAY BE UNDERSTOOD WHY FIRE AND THE MORE SUBTILE DISSOLVER PUTREFACTION BY DIVIDING THE PARTICLES OF SUBSTANCES TURN THEM TO BLACK
7065-74597-0036 WHY SMALL QUANTITIES OF BLACK SUBSTANCES IMPART THEIR COLOUR VERY FREELY AND INTENSELY TO OTHER SUBSTANCES TO WHICH THEY ARE APPLIED THE MINUTE PARTICLES OF THESE BY REASON OF THEIR VERY GREAT NUMBER EASILY OVERSPREADING THE GROSS PARTICLES OF OTHERS
7065-74597-0037 WHY GLASS GROUND VERY ELABORATELY WITH SAND ON A COPPER PLATE TILL IT BE WELL POLISH'D MAKES THE SAND TOGETHER WITH WHAT IS WORN OFF FROM THE GLASS AND COPPER BECOME VERY BLACK WHY BLACK SUBSTANCES DO SOONEST OF ALL OTHERS
7065-74597-0038 BECOME HOT IN THE SUN'S LIGHT AND BURN WHICH EFFECT MAY PROCEED PARTLY FROM THE MULTITUDE OF REFRACTIONS IN A LITTLE ROOM AND PARTLY FROM THE EASY COMMOTION OF SO VERY SMALL CORPUSCLES
7065-74597-0039 AND WHY BLACKS ARE USUALLY A LITTLE INCLINED TO A BLUISH COLOUR FOR THAT THEY ARE SO
7065-74597-0040 BY LIGHT REFLECTED FROM BLACK SUBSTANCES FOR THE PAPER WILL USUALLY APPEAR OF A BLUISH WHITE AND THE REASON IS THAT BLACK BORDERS IN THE OBSCURE BLUE OF THE ORDER DESCRIBED IN THE EIGHTEENTH OBSERVATION AND THEREFORE REFLECTS MORE RAYS OF THAT COLOUR
7065-74597-0041 THAN OF ANY OTHER IN THESE DESCRIPTIONS I HAVE BEEN THE MORE PARTICULAR BECAUSE IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT MICROSCOPES MAY AT LENGTH BE IMPROVED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE PARTICLES OF BODIES ON WHICH THEIR COLOURS DEPEND
7065-74597-0042 IF THEY ARE NOT ALREADY IN SOME MEASURE ARRIVED TO THAT DEGREE OF PERFECTION FOR IF THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE OR CAN BE SO FAR IMPROVED AS WITH SUFFICIENT DISTINCTNESS TO REPRESENT OBJECTS FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED TIMES BIGGER
7065-74597-0043 THAN AT A FOOT DISTANCE THEY APPEAR TO OUR NAKED EYES I SHOULD HOPE THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DISCOVER SOME OF THE GREATEST OF THOSE CORPUSCLES AND BY ONE THAT WOULD MAGNIFY THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND TIMES PERHAPS THEY MIGHT ALL BE DISCOVER'D
