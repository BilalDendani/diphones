3187-168500-0000 WITHOUT IT THE CRUELTIES OF GOD WOULD STRAIN FAITH TO THE BREAKING POINT BUT OUTSIDE THE FOLD IT IS GRADUALLY FALLING INTO DECAY
3187-168500-0001 SUCH MEN OF SCIENCE AS GEORGE W CRILE AND JACQUES LOEB HAVE DEALT IT STAGGERING BLOWS AND AMONG LAYMEN OF INQUIRING MIND IT SEEMS TO BE GIVING WAY TO AN APOLOGETIC SORT OF DETERMINISM
3187-168500-0002 A DETERMINISM ONE MAY SAY TEMPERED BY DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION THE LATE MARK TWAIN IN HIS SECRET HEART WAS SUCH A DETERMINIST IN HIS WHAT IS MAN
3187-168500-0003 YOU WILL FIND HIM AT HIS FAREWELLS TO LIBERTARIANISM THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR ACTS HE ARGUES ARE DETERMINED BUT THERE REMAINS A RESIDUUM OF FREE CHOICES
3187-168500-0004 HERE WE STAND FREE OF COMPULSION AND FACE A PAIR OR MORE OF ALTERNATIVES AND ARE FREE TO GO THIS WAY OR THAT A PILLOW FOR FREE WILL TO FALL UPON
3187-168500-0005 BUT ONE LOADED WITH DISCONCERTING BRICKBATS WHERE THE OCCUPANTS OF THIS LAST TRENCH OF LIBERTARIANISM ERR IS IN THEIR ASSUMPTION THAT THE PULLS OF THEIR ANTAGONISTIC IMPULSES ARE EXACTLY EQUAL
3187-168500-0006 THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS ABSOLUTELY FREE TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE HE WILL YIELD TO SUCH FREEDOM IN PRACTISE IS NEVER ENCOUNTERED WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL CONFRONTS ALTERNATIVES
3187-168500-0007 IT IS NOT ALONE HIS VOLITION THAT CHOOSES BETWEEN THEM BUT ALSO HIS ENVIRONMENT HIS INHERITED PREJUDICES HIS RACE HIS COLOR HIS CONDITION OF SERVITUDE
3187-168500-0008 I MAY KISS A GIRL OR I MAY NOT KISS HER BUT SURELY IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO SAY THAT I AM IN ANY TRUE SENSE A FREE AGENT IN THE MATTER
3187-168500-0009 THE WORLD HAS EVEN PUT MY HELPLESSNESS INTO A PROVERB IT SAYS THAT MY DECISION AND ACT DEPEND UPON THE TIME THE PLACE AND EVEN TO SOME EXTENT UPON THE GIRL
3187-168500-0010 EXAMPLES MIGHT BE MULTIPLIED AD INFINITUM I CAN SCARCELY REMEMBER PERFORMING A WHOLLY VOLUNTARY ACT MY WHOLE LIFE AS I LOOK BACK UPON IT
3187-168500-0011 SEEMS TO BE A LONG SERIES OF INEXPLICABLE ACCIDENTS NOT ONLY QUITE UNAVOIDABLE BUT EVEN QUITE UNINTELLIGIBLE
3187-168500-0012 ITS HISTORY IS THE HISTORY OF THE REACTIONS OF MY PERSONALITY TO MY ENVIRONMENT OF MY BEHAVIOR BEFORE EXTERNAL STIMULI I HAVE BEEN NO MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT PERSONALITY
3187-168500-0013 THAN I HAVE BEEN FOR THAT ENVIRONMENT TO SAY THAT I CAN CHANGE THE FORMER BY A VOLUNTARY EFFORT IS AS RIDICULOUS AS TO SAY THAT I CAN MODIFY THE CURVATURE OF THE LENSES OF MY EYES I KNOW
3187-168500-0014 BECAUSE I HAVE OFTEN TRIED TO CHANGE IT AND ALWAYS FAILED NEVERTHELESS IT HAS CHANGED I AM NOT THE SAME MAN I WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY
3187-168500-0015 BUT THE GRATIFYING IMPROVEMENTS SO PLAINLY VISIBLE ARE SURELY NOT TO BE CREDITED TO ME ALL OF THEM CAME FROM WITHOUT OR FROM UNPLUMBABLE AND UNCONTROLLABLE DEPTHS WITHIN
3187-168500-0016 THE MORE THE MATTER IS EXAMINED THE MORE THE RESIDUUM OF FREE WILL SHRINKS AND SHRINKS UNTIL IN THE END IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IT
3187-168500-0017 A GREAT MANY MEN OF COURSE LOOKING AT THEMSELVES SEE IT AS SOMETHING VERY LARGE THEY SLAP THEIR CHESTS AND CALL THEMSELVES FREE AGENTS AND DEMAND THAT GOD REWARD THEM FOR THEIR VIRTUE
3187-168500-0018 BUT THESE FELLOWS ARE SIMPLY IDIOTIC EGOISTS DEVOID OF A CRITICAL SENSE THEY MISTAKE THE ACTS OF GOD FOR THEIR OWN ACTS OF SUCH SORT ARE THE COXCOMBS WHO BOAST ABOUT WOOING AND WINNING THEIR WIVES
3187-168500-0019 THEY ARE BROTHERS TO THE FOX WHO BOASTED THAT HE HAD MADE THE HOUNDS RUN THE THROWING OVERBOARD OF FREE WILL IS COMMONLY DENOUNCED ON THE GROUND THAT IT SUBVERTS MORALITY AND MAKES OF RELIGION A MOCKING
3187-168500-0020 SUCH PIOUS OBJECTIONS OF COURSE ARE FOREIGN TO LOGIC BUT NEVERTHELESS IT MAY BE WELL TO GIVE A GLANCE TO THIS ONE IT IS BASED UPON THE FALLACIOUS HYPOTHESIS THAT THE DETERMINIST ESCAPES
3187-168500-0021 OR HOPES TO ESCAPE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTS NOTHING COULD BE MORE UNTRUE CONSEQUENCES FOLLOW ACTS JUST AS RELENTLESSLY IF THE LATTER BE INVOLUNTARY AS IF THEY BE VOLUNTARY
3187-168500-0022 IF I ROB A BANK OF MY FREE CHOICE OR IN RESPONSE TO SOME UNFATHOMABLE INNER NECESSITY IT IS ALL ONE I WILL GO TO THE SAME JAIL
3187-168500-0023 CONSCRIPTS IN WAR ARE KILLED JUST AS OFTEN AS VOLUNTEERS MEN WHO ARE TRACKED DOWN AND SHANGHAIED BY THEIR WIVES HAVE JUST AS HARD A TIME OF IT
3187-168500-0024 AS MEN WHO WALK FATUOUSLY INTO THE TRAP BY FORMALLY PROPOSING EVEN ON THE GHOSTLY SIDE DETERMINISM DOES NOT DO MUCH DAMAGE TO THEOLOGY
3187-168500-0025 IT IS NO HARDER TO BELIEVE THAT A MAN WILL BE DAMNED FOR HIS INVOLUNTARY ACTS THAN IT IS TO BELIEVE THAT HE WILL BE DAMNED FOR HIS VOLUNTARY ACTS FOR EVEN THE SUPPOSITION THAT HE IS WHOLLY FREE
3187-168500-0026 DOES NOT DISPOSE OF THE MASSIVE FACT THAT GOD MADE HIM AS HE IS
3187-168500-0027 TO DENY THIS IS TO FLOUT OMNIPOTENCE A CRIME AT WHICH AS I HAVE OFTEN SAID I BALK BUT HERE
3187-168500-0028 I BEGIN TO FEAR THAT I WADE TOO FAR INTO THE HOT WATERS OF THE SACRED SCIENCES AND THAT I HAD BETTER RETIRE BEFORE I LOSE MY HIDE THIS PRUDENT RETIREMENT IS PURELY DETERMINISTIC
3187-168500-0029 I DO NOT ASCRIBE IT TO MY OWN SAGACITY I ASCRIBE IT WHOLLY TO THAT SINGULAR KINDNESS WHICH FATE ALWAYS SHOWS ME IF I WERE FREE I'D PROBABLY KEEP ON AND THEN REGRET IT AFTERWARD
3187-168500-0030 ALL GREAT RELIGIONS IN ORDER TO ESCAPE ABSURDITY HAVE TO ADMIT A DILUTION OF AGNOSTICISM IT IS ONLY THE SAVAGE WHETHER OF THE AFRICAN BUSH OR THE AMERICAN GOSPEL TENT
3187-168500-0031 WHO PRETENDS TO KNOW THE WILL AND INTENT OF GOD EXACTLY AND COMPLETELY FOR WHO HATH KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD ASKED PAUL OF THE ROMANS HOW UNSEARCHABLE ARE HIS JUDGMENTS AND HIS WAYS PAST FINDING OUT
3187-168500-0032 IT IS THE GLORY OF GOD SAID SOLOMON TO CONCEAL A THING CLOUDS AND DARKNESS SAID DAVID ARE AROUND HIM NO MAN SAID THE PREACHER CAN FIND OUT THE WORK OF GOD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGIONS
3187-168500-0033 THE PHILOSOPHY OF DOUBT IS FAR MORE COMFORTING THAN THAT OF HOPE THE DOUBTER ESCAPES THE WORST PENALTY OF THE MAN OF HOPE HE IS NEVER DISAPPOINTED AND HENCE NEVER INDIGNANT
3187-168500-0034 THE INEXPLICABLE AND IRREMEDIABLE MAY INTEREST HIM BUT THEY DO NOT ENRAGE HIM OR I MAY ADD FOOL HIM
3187-168500-0035 THIS IMMUNITY IS WORTH ALL THE DUBIOUS ASSURANCES EVER FOISTED UPON MAN IT IS PRAGMATICALLY IMPREGNABLE MOREOVER IT MAKES FOR TOLERANCE AND SYMPATHY
3187-168500-0036 THE DOUBTER DOES NOT HATE HIS OPPONENTS HE SYMPATHIZES WITH THEM IN THE END HE MAY EVEN COME TO SYMPATHIZE WITH GOD
3187-168500-0037 THE OLD IDEA OF FATHERHOOD HERE SUBMERGES IN A NEW IDEA OF BROTHERHOOD GOD TOO IS BESET BY LIMITATIONS DIFFICULTIES BROKEN HOPES
3187-168500-0038 IS IT DISCONCERTING TO THINK OF HIM THUS WELL IS IT ANY THE LESS DISCONCERTING TO THINK OF HIM AS ABLE TO EASE AND ANSWER AND YET FAILING BUT HE THAT DOUBTETH
3187-168500-0039 AT ONCE THE PENALTY OF DOUBT AND ITS PROOF EXCUSE AND GENESIS
3187-168500-0040 A SALIENT OBJECTION TO THE PREVAILING RELIGIOUS CEREMONIAL LIES IN THE ATTITUDES OF ABASEMENT THAT IT ENFORCES UPON THE FAITHFUL A MAN WOULD BE THOUGHT A SLIMY AND KNAVISH FELLOW
3187-168500-0041 IF HE APPROACHED ANY HUMAN JUDGE OR POTENTATE IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR APPROACHING THE LORD GOD IT IS AN ETIQUETTE THAT INVOLVES LOSS OF SELF RESPECT AND HENCE
3187-168500-0042 IT CANNOT BE PLEASING TO ITS OBJECT FOR ONE CANNOT THINK OF THE LORD GOD AS SACRIFICING DECENT FEELINGS TO MERE VANITY THIS NOTION OF ABASEMENT
3187-168500-0043 LIKE MOST OF THE OTHER IDEAS THAT ARE GENERAL IN THE WORLD IS OBVIOUSLY THE INVENTION OF SMALL AND IGNOBLE MEN IT IS THE POLLUTION OF THEOLOGY BY THE SKLAVMORAL
3187-168500-0044 RITUAL IS TO RELIGION WHAT THE MUSIC OF AN OPERA IS TO THE LIBRETTO OSTENSIBLY A MEANS OF INTERPRETATION BUT ACTUALLY A MEANS OF CONCEALMENT
3187-168500-0045 THE PRESBYTERIANS MADE THE MISTAKE OF KEEPING THE DOCTRINE OF INFANT DAMNATION IN PLAIN WORDS AS ENLIGHTENMENT GREW IN THE WORLD INTELLIGENCE AND PRUDERY REVOLTED AGAINST IT
3187-168500-0046 AND SO IT HAD TO BE ABANDONED HAD IT BEEN SET TO MUSIC IT WOULD HAVE SURVIVED UNCOMPREHENDED UNSUSPECTED AND UNCHALLENGED
3187-168500-0047 POI CRISTIANI I HAVE SPOKEN OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT GOD TOO MAY SUFFER FROM A FINITE INTELLIGENCE AND SO KNOW THE BITTER STING OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND DEFEAT
3187-168500-0048 HERE I YIELDED SOMETHING TO POLITENESS THE THING IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT OBVIOUS LIKE MAN GOD IS DECEIVED BY APPEARANCES AND PROBABILITIES
3187-168500-0049 HE MAKES CALCULATIONS THAT DO NOT WORK OUT HE FALLS INTO SPECIOUS ASSUMPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE HE ASSUMED THAT ADAM AND EVE WOULD OBEY THE LAW IN THE GARDEN AGAIN
3187-168500-0050 HE ASSUMED THAT THE APPALLING LESSON OF THE FLOOD WOULD MAKE MEN BETTER YET AGAIN HE ASSUMED THAT MEN WOULD ALWAYS PUT RELIGION IN FIRST PLACE AMONG THEIR CONCERNS
3187-168500-0051 THAT IT WOULD BE ETERNALLY POSSIBLE TO REACH AND INFLUENCE THEM THROUGH IT THIS LAST ASSUMPTION WAS THE MOST ERRONEOUS OF THEM ALL THE TRUTH IS THAT THE GENERALITY OF MEN
3187-168500-0052 WHEN WE ENCOUNTER ONE WHO STILL DOES SO HE SEEMS ECCENTRIC ALMOST FEEBLE MINDED OR MORE COMMONLY A ROGUE WHO HAS BEEN DELUDED BY HIS OWN HYPOCRISY
3187-168500-0053 EVEN MEN WHO ARE PROFESSIONALLY RELIGIOUS AND WHO THUS HAVE FAR MORE INCENTIVE TO STICK TO RELIGION THAN THE REST OF US NEARLY ALWAYS THROW IT OVERBOARD AT THE FIRST SERIOUS TEMPTATION
3187-168500-0054 DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS FOR EXAMPLE CHRISTIANITY HAS BEEN IN COMBAT WITH PATRIOTISM ALL OVER CHRISTENDOM WHICH HAS PREVAILED HOW MANY GENTLEMEN OF GOD
3187-168500-0055 HAVE ACTUALLY CHOSEN CHRIST
3187-168500-0056 ON AGAIN THE OSTENSIBLE OBJECT OF THE REFORMATION WHICH LATELY REACHED ITS FOURTH CENTENARY WAS TO PURGE THE CHURCH OF IMBECILITIES THAT OBJECT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
3187-168500-0057 THE CHURCH SHOOK THEM OFF BUT IMBECILITIES MAKE AN IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO MAN HE INEVITABLY TRIES TO PRESERVE THEM BY CLOAKING THEM WITH RELIGIOUS SANCTIONS THE RESULT IS PROTESTANTISM
3187-168500-0058 THEOLOGY THE NOTION THAT THEOLOGY IS A DULL SUBJECT IS ONE OF THE STRANGEST DELUSIONS OF A STUPID AND UNCRITICAL AGE
3187-168500-0059 THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME OF THE MOST ENGROSSING BOOKS EVER WRITTEN IN THE WORLD ARE FULL OF IT FOR EXAMPLE THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SAINT LUKE FOR EXAMPLE NIETZSCHE'S DER ANTICHRIST
3187-168500-0060 FOR EXAMPLE MARK TWAIN'S WHAT IS MAN SAINT AUGUSTINE'S CONFESSIONS HAECKEL'S THE RIDDLE OF THE UNIVERSE AND HUXLEY'S ESSAYS HOW INDEED COULD A THING BE DULL
3187-168500-0061 THAT HAS SENT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN THE VERY BEST AND THE VERY WORST OF THE RACE TO THE GALLOWS AND THE STAKE AND MADE AND BROKEN DYNASTIES
3187-168500-0062 AND INSPIRED THE GREATEST OF HUMAN HOPES AND ENTERPRISES AND EMBROILED WHOLE CONTINENTS IN WAR NO THEOLOGY IS NOT A SOPORIFIC THE REASON IT SO OFTEN SEEMS SO
3187-168500-0063 IS THAT ITS PUBLIC EXPOSITION HAS CHIEFLY FALLEN IN THESE LATER DAYS INTO THE HANDS OF A SECT OF INTELLECTUAL CASTRATI WHO BEGIN BY MISTAKING IT FOR A SUB DEPARTMENT OF ETIQUETTE
3187-168500-0064 AND THEN PROCEED TO ANOINT IT WITH BUTTER ROSE WATER AND TALCUM POWDER WHENEVER A FIRST RATE INTELLECT TACKLES IT AS IN THE CASE OF HUXLEY OR IN THAT OF LEO
3187-168500-0065 IT AT ONCE TAKES ON ALL THE SINISTER FASCINATION IT HAD IN LUTHER'S DAY
3187-168500-0066 DO I LET THE POOR SUFFER AND CONSIGN THEM AS OLD FRIEDRICH USED TO SAY TO STATISTICS AND THE DEVIL WELL
