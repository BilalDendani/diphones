2754-161902-0000 EXTRAVAGANT STORIES AGAINST FATHER LA COMBE THE MORE THEY SAID TO ME TO HIS DISADVANTAGE THE MORE ESTEEM I FELT FOR HIM I ANSWERED THEM
2754-161902-0001 PERHAPS I MAY NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN BUT I SHALL EVER BE GLAD
2754-161902-0002 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE I KNOW IT TO BE NONE OF MY VOCATION THEY ASKED ME WHO COULD KNOW THAT BETTER THAN THE BISHOP THEY FURTHER TOLD ME
2754-161902-0003 I WAS UNDER A DECEPTION AND MY STATE WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING
2754-161902-0004 OF REQUIRING AND OF EXACTING WHAT HE REQUIRES AND IN WHATEVER MANNER HE DEMANDS IT A SOUL IN THIS STATE SEEKS NOTHING FOR ITSELF BUT ALL FOR GOD
2754-161902-0005 IT LEAVES ITSELF TO BE CONDUCTED BY GOD'S PROVIDENCES AND CREATURES OUTWARDLY ITS LIFE SEEMS QUITE COMMON INWARDLY
2754-161902-0006 IT IS WHOLLY RESIGNED TO THE DIVINE WILL THE MORE EVERYTHING APPEARS ADVERSE AND EVEN DESPERATE
2754-161902-0007 IN SPITE OF THE ANNOYANCE AND PAIN OF THE SENSES AND OF THE CREATURES WHICH FOR SOME TIME AFTER THE NEW LIFE RAISE SOME CLOUDS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
2754-161902-0008 AS I HAVE ALREADY SIGNIFIED BUT WHEN THE SOUL IS ENTIRELY PASSED INTO ITS ORIGINAL BEING ALL THESE THINGS NO MORE CAUSE ANY SEPARATION OR PARTITION IT FINDS
2754-161902-0009 NO MORE OF THAT IMPURITY WHICH CAME FROM SELF SEEKING FROM A HUMAN MANNER OF ACTING FROM AN UNGUARDED WORD FROM ANY WARM EMOTION OR EAGERNESS WHICH CAUSED
2754-161902-0010 COULD NEITHER PREVENT NOR REMEDY HAVING SO OFTEN EXPERIENCED ITS OWN EFFORTS TO BE USELESS AND EVEN HURTFUL AS THEY DID NOTHING ELSE
2754-161902-0011 THE WHOLE WORK OF PURIFICATION COMES FROM GOD ONLY AFTERWARD THIS CONDUCT BECOMES NATURAL THEN THE SOUL CAN SAY WITH THE ROYAL PROPHET
2754-161902-0012 THOUGH AN HOST SHOULD ENCAMP AGAINST ME MY HEART SHALL NOT FEAR THOUGH WAR SHOULD RISE UP AGAINST ME IN HIM
2754-161902-0013 SEES MEET TO ORDER BE IT WHAT IT MAY
2754-161902-0014 GREAT OR SMALL SWEET OR BITTER HONOR WEALTH LIFE
2754-161902-0015 IT IS TRUE OUR NATURE IS SO CRAFTY THAT IT WORMS ITSELF THROUGH EVERYTHING A SELFISH SIGHT
2754-161902-0016 IT DESTROYS
2754-161902-0017 WHETHER CONDUCTED BY LIGHTS GIFTS OR ECSTASIES OR BY THE ENTIRE DESTRUCTION OF SELF IN THE WAY OF NAKED FAITH BOTH THESE STATES ARE FOUND IN THE APOSTLE PAUL
2754-161902-0018 HE TELLS US AND LEST I SHOULD BE EXALTED ABOVE MEASURE THROUGH THE ABUNDANCE OF REVELATIONS THERE WAS GIVEN TO ME A THORN IN THE FLESH THE MESSENGER
2754-161902-0019 OF SATAN TO BUFFET ME HE PRAYED THRICE
2754-161902-0020 MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR THEE FOR MY STRENGTH IS MADE PERFECT IN WEAKNESS HE PROVED ALSO ANOTHER STATE
2754-161902-0021 THROUGH HIS OWN LIFE THEN THERE IS NO LONGER A STING IN DEATH OR THORN IN THE FLESH CAPABLE OF PAINING OR HURTING ANY MORE AT FIRST INDEED
2754-161902-0022 WITHOUT ALLOWING IT THE LEAST INDULGENCE TILL IT LEAVES EVERYTHING TO GO ON WITH GOD IN PURITY AS IT COMES FROM HIM TILL THE SOUL
2754-161902-0023 IT ALWAYS SULLIES BY ITS OWN MIXTURE THE OPERATION OF GOD LIKE THOSE RIVULETS WHICH CONTRACT THE CORRUPTION OF THE PLACES THEY PASS THROUGH BUT FLOWING IN A PURE PLACE
2754-161902-0024 REMAIN IN THE PURITY OF THEIR SOURCE UNLESS GOD THROUGH EXPERIENCE MAKES KNOWN HIS GUIDANCE TO THE SOUL IT CAN NEVER COMPREHEND IT OH
2754-161902-0025 IF SOULS HAD COURAGE ENOUGH TO RESIGN THEMSELVES TO THE WORK OF PURIFICATION WITHOUT HAVING ANY WEAK AND FOOLISH PITY ON THEMSELVES WHAT A NOBLE RAPID
2754-161902-0026 AND HAPPY PROGRESS WOULD THEY MAKE
2754-161902-0027 NOT TO AFFORD ANY NOURISHMENT TO SELF LOVE WHICH IS SO DEEP ROOTED THAT ITS EMPIRE IS NOT EASILY DEMOLISHED OFTEN THE IDEA WHICH A MAN FALSELY CONCEIVES
2754-161902-0028 OF THE GREATNESS OF HIS ADVANCEMENT IN DIVINE EXPERIENCE MAKES HIM WANT TO BE SEEN AND KNOWN OF MEN AND TO WISH TO SEE THE VERY SAME PERFECTION IN OTHERS
2754-161902-0029 AND TOO HIGH OF HIS OWN STATE THEN IT BECOMES A PAIN TO HIM TO CONVERSE WITH PEOPLE TOO HUMAN
2754-161902-0030 TRULY MORTIFIED AND RESIGNED WOULD RATHER CONVERSE WITH THE WORST BY THE ORDER OF PROVIDENCE THAN WITH THE BEST OF ITS OWN CHOICE WANTING
2754-161902-0031 NOR WANTS TO KNOW ANYTHING BUT WHAT GOD CALLS IT TO
2754-161902-0032 AFTER A MANNER VAST IMMENSE AND INDEPENDENT OF EXTERIOR EVENTS MORE SATISFIED IN ITS HUMILIATION
2754-161902-0033 BY THE ORDER OF PROVIDENCE THAN ON THE THRONE OF ITS OWN CHOICE IT IS HERE THAT THE APOSTOLIC LIFE BEGINS
2754-161902-0034 BUT DO ALL REACH THAT STATE VERY FEW INDEED AS FAR AS I CAN COMPREHEND
2754-161902-0035 GIFTS AND GRACES A HOLY LIFE IN WHICH THE CREATURE APPEARS ALL ADMIRABLE AS THIS LIFE IS MORE APPARENT
