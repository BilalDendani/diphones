4238-12538-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY MAKING A PERMANENT HOME IN THE WILDS
4238-12538-0001 VENTURE IN THE GOLD FIELD WERE MORE PEACEFUL AND PROSPEROUS SOON AFTER THE INDIAN WAR WE HAD MOVED TO A NEW CLAIM WE BEGAN NOW TO REALIZE TO THE FULL OUR DREAM OF EARLIER DAYS
4238-12538-0002 TO SETTLE ON A FARM AND BUILD A HOME THREE NEIGHBORS WERE ALL WE HAD AND THE NEAREST LIVED NEARLY TWO MILES AWAY TWO OF THEM KEPT BACHELOR'S HALL
4238-12538-0003 THE THICK HIGH TIMBER MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO SEE ANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS HOUSES WE COULD REACH ONLY ONE BY A ROAD TO THE OTHERS WE MIGHT GO BY A TRAIL
4238-12538-0004 UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS WE COULD NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SCHOOL THIS HOWEVER DID NOT KEEP US FROM HAVING A SCHOOL OF OUR OWN ONE DAY ONE OF OUR FARTHER OFF NEIGHBORS
4238-12538-0005 WHO LIVED MORE THAN FOUR MILES AWAY CAME TO VISIT US NATURALLY THE CHILDREN FLOCKED AROUND HIM TO HEAR HIS STORIES IN BROAD SCOTCH AND TO PLY HIM WITH QUESTIONS IN HIS TURN
4238-12538-0006 HE BEGAN TO ASK THEM QUESTIONS ONE OF THESE WAS WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO GO TO SCHOOL OH WE HAVE SCHOOL NOW RESPONDED THE CHILDREN WE HAVE SCHOOL EVERY DAY
4238-12538-0007 AND PRAY WHO IS YOUR TEACHER AND WHERE IS YOUR SCHOOLHOUSE FATHER TEACHES US AT HOME EVERY MORNING BEFORE BREAKFAST HE HEARS THE LESSONS THEN AND
4238-12538-0008 YOUR FATHER TOLD ME A WHILE AGO THAT YOU HAD YOUR BREAKFAST AT SIX O'CLOCK WHAT TIME DO YOU GET UP WHY FATHER SETS THE CLOCK FOR HALF PAST FOUR
4238-12538-0009 AND THAT GIVES US AN HOUR WHILE MOTHER GETS BREAKFAST YOU KNOW BOYS AND GIRLS OF TODAY MAY PITY THOSE POOR PIONEER CHILDREN WHO HAD TO GET UP SO EARLY
4238-12538-0010 THEY MAY AS WELL DISMISS SUCH FEELINGS FROM THEIR HEARTS THE CHILDREN WERE CHEERFUL AND HEALTHY THEY DID SOME WORK DURING THE DAY IN ADDITION TO STUDYING THEIR LESSONS AND BESIDES
4238-12538-0011 THEY WENT TO BED EARLIER THAN SOME BOYS AND GIRLS DO THESE DAYS IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THE WRECK OF THE STEAMER NORTHERNER BROUGHT GREAT SORROW TO US
4238-12538-0012 FOR MY BROTHER OLIVER WAS AMONG THOSE LOST THE SHIP STRUCK ON AN UNCHARTED ROCK DURING THE STAY AT STEILACOOM IN THE TIME OF THE INDIAN TROUBLES
4238-12538-0013 WE HAD BEGUN A TRADING VENTURE IN A SMALL WAY THE VENTURE HAVING PROVED SUCCESSFUL WE INVESTED ALL OUR SAVINGS IN A NEW STOCK OF MERCHANDISE AND THIS STOCK
4238-12538-0014 NOT ALL PAID FOR WENT DOWN WITH THE SHIP AGAIN WE MUST START IN LIFE AND WE MOVED TO A NEW LOCATION A HOMESTEAD IN THE PUYALLUP VALLEY
4238-12538-0015 HERE WE LIVED AND FARMED FOR FORTY ONE YEARS SEEING THE TOWN OF PUYALLUP GROW UP ON AND AROUND THE HOMESTEAD
4238-12538-0016 IN THE PUYALLUP VALLEY THERE WERE MORE NEIGHBORS TWO FAMILIES TO THE SQUARE MILE YET NO NEIGHBORS WERE IN SIGHT BECAUSE THE TIMBER AND UNDERBRUSH WERE SO THICK WE COULD SCARCELY SEE
4238-12538-0017 TWO RODS FROM THE EDGE OF OUR CLEARING BUT THE NEIGHBORS WERE NEAR ENOUGH FOR US TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC SCHOOL AND BUILD A SCHOOLHOUSE SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS TOOK THEIR AXES TO CUT THE LOGS
4238-12538-0018 SOME THEIR OXEN TO DRAG THEM OTHERS THEIR SAWS AND CLEAVING TOOLS TO MAKE CLAPBOARDS FOR THE ROOF OTHERS AGAIN MORE HANDY WITH TOOLS MADE THE BENCHES OUT OF SPLIT LOGS OR
4238-12538-0019 AS WE CALLED THEM PUNCHEONS WITH WILLING HANDS TO HELP THE SCHOOLHOUSE SOON RECEIVED THE FINISHING TOUCHES THE SIDE WALLS WERE SCARCELY HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE DOORWAY
4238-12538-0020 SO ONE WAS CUT IN THE END THE DOOR HUNG ON WOODEN HINGES WHICH SQUEAKED A GOOD DEAL WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED OR SHUT BUT THE CHILDREN DID NOT MIND THAT
4238-12538-0021 THE ROOF ANSWERED WELL ENOUGH FOR THE CEILING OVERHEAD AND A CUT IN ONE OF THE LOGS ON EACH SIDE MADE TWO LONG NARROW WINDOWS FOR LIGHT THE CHILDREN SAT WITH THEIR FACES TO THE WALLS
4238-12538-0022 WITH LONG SHELVES IN FRONT OF THEM WHILE THE SMALLER TOTS SAT ON LOW BENCHES NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WHEN THE WEATHER WOULD PERMIT THE TEACHER LEFT THE DOOR OPEN TO ADMIT MORE LIGHT
4238-12538-0023 THERE WAS NO NEED TO LET IN MORE FRESH AIR AS THE ROOF WAS QUITE OPEN AND THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE LOGS LET IN PLENTY OF IT SOMETIMES WE HAD A WOMAN FOR TEACHER
4238-12538-0024 AND THEN THE SALARY WAS SMALLER AS SHE BOARDED AROUND THAT MEANT SOME DISCOMFORT FOR HER DURING PART OF THE TIME WHERE THE SURROUNDINGS WERE NOT PLEASANT ONE DAY LITTLE CARRIE
4238-12538-0025 MY DAUGHTER STARTED TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT SOON CAME RUNNING BACK OUT OF BREATH MAMMA MAMMA I SAW A GREAT BIG CAT SHARPENING HIS CLAWS ON A GREAT BIG TREE
4238-12538-0026 SHE SAID AS SOON AS SHE COULD CATCH HER BREATH SURE ENOUGH UPON EXAMINATION THERE WERE THE MARKS OF A COUGAR AS HIGH UP ON THE TREE AS I COULD REACH IT MUST HAVE BEEN A BIG ONE TO REACH SO FAR UP THE TREE
4238-12538-0027 BUT THE INCIDENT SOON DROPPED OUT OF MIND AND THE CHILDREN WENT TO SCHOOL ON THE TRAIL AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED AFTERWARDS I MET A COUGAR ON A LONELY TRAIL IN THE WOODS
4238-12538-0028 NEAR WHERE AUBURN NOW STANDS I HAD BEEN ATTEMPTING TO DRIVE SOME WILD CATTLE HOME BUT THEY WERE SO UNRULY THAT THEY SCATTERED THROUGH THE TIMBER AND I WAS OBLIGED TO GO ON WITHOUT THEM LATE IN THE DAY
4238-12538-0029 THAT IT WAS HARD TO SEE THE ROAD EVEN WHEN THE SUN WAS SHINING ON A CLOUDY DAY IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE NIGHT THOUGH I COULD SEE WELL ENOUGH TO KEEP ON THE CROOKED TRAIL
4238-12538-0030 JUST BEFORE I GOT TO STUCK RIVER CROSSING I CAME TO A TURN IN THE TRAIL WHERE IT CROSSED THE TOP OF A BIG FIR THAT HAD BEEN TURNED UP BY THE ROOTS AND HAD FALLEN NEARLY PARALLEL WITH THE TRAIL
4238-12538-0031 THE BIG ROOTS HELD THE BUTT OF THE TREE UP FROM THE GROUND I THINK THE TREE WAS FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER A HUNDRED FEET FROM THE BUTT AND THE WHOLE BODY FROM ROOT TO TOP WAS
4238-12538-0032 EIGHTY FOUR STEPS LONG OR ABOUT
4238-12538-0033 I DIDN'T STOP TO STEP IT THEN BUT YOU MAY BE SURE I TOOK SOME PRETTY LONG STRIDES ABOUT THAT TIME FOR JUST AS I STEPPED OVER THE FALLEN TREE NEAR THE TOP I SAW SOMETHING MOVE ON THE BIG BODY NEAR THE ROOTS
4238-12538-0034 THE THING WAS COMING RIGHT TOWARDS ME IN AN INSTANT I REALIZED THAT IT WAS A GREAT COUGAR HE WAS PRETTY BUT HE DID NOT LOOK ESPECIALLY PLEASING TO ME I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
4238-12538-0035 I HAD NO GUN WITH ME AND I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THERE WAS NO USE TO RUN WAS I SCARED DID YOU SAY DID YOU EVER HAVE CREEPERS RUN UP YOUR BACK AND RIGHT TO THE ROOTS OF YOUR HAIR AND NEARLY TO THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD
4238-12538-0036 IF I HAD BEEN HURT I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE TO
4238-12538-0037 THE FUN OF IT WAS THAT THE COUGAR HADN'T SEEN ME YET BUT AS SOON AS HE DID HE SCAMPERED OFF AS IF THE OLD HARRY HIMSELF WERE AFTER HIM WHILE I SPED OFF DOWN THE TRAIL AS IF OLD BEELZEBUB WERE AFTER ME
4238-12538-0038 BUT NO WILD ANIMALS EVER HARMED US AND WE DID NOT DIE FOR WANT OF FOOD CLOTHING OR SHELTER ALTHOUGH WE DID HAVE SOME EXPERIENCES THAT WERE TRYING
4238-12538-0039 BEFORE THE CLEARINGS WERE LARGE WE SOMETIMES WERE PINCHED FOR BOTH FOOD AND CLOTHING I WILL NOT SAY WE SUFFERED MUCH FOR EITHER
4238-12538-0040 THOUGH I KNOW THAT SOME FAMILIES AT TIMES LIVED ON POTATOES STRAIGHT USUALLY FISH COULD BE HAD IN ABUNDANCE
4238-12538-0041 BUT WE MANAGED TO GET LEATHER TO MAKE EACH MEMBER OF THE FAMILY ONE PAIR WE KILLED A PIG TO GET BRISTLES FOR THE WAX ENDS CUT THE PEGS FROM ALDER LOG AND SEASONED THEM IN THE OVEN
4238-12538-0042 AND MADE THE LASTS OUT OF THE SAME TIMBER THOSE SHOES WERE CLUMSY TO BE SURE BUT THEY KEPT OUR FEET DRY AND WARM
4238-12538-0043 AND WE FELT THANKFUL FOR THEM AND SORRY FOR SOME NEIGHBORS CHILDREN WHO HAD TO GO BAREFOOTED EVEN IN QUITE COLD WEATHER CARRIE ONCE HAD A PAIR OF NICE WHITE SHOES
4238-12538-0044 FOR BEST I REMEMBER THAT ONE OF HER BROTHERS MADE FOR HER WITH BUCKSKIN UPPERS AND LIGHT TAN COLORED SOLES
4238-12538-0045 YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT WE HAD NO RECREATION AND THAT WE WERE A SORROWFUL SET THERE WAS NEVER A HAPPIER LOT OF PEOPLE THAN THESE SAME HARD WORKING PIONEERS AND THEIR FAMILIES
4238-12538-0046 WE HAD JOY IN OUR HOME LIFE AND AMUSEMENTS AS WELL AS LABOR MUSIC WAS OUR GREATEST PLEASURE WE NEVER TIRED OF IT UNCLE JOHN
4238-12538-0047 AS EVERY ONE CALLED HIM THE OLD TEACHER WAS CONSTANTLY TEACHING THE CHILDREN MUSIC SO IT SOON CAME ABOUT THEY COULD READ THEIR MUSIC AS READILY AS THEY COULD THEIR SCHOOL BOOKS
4238-12538-0048 NO CHRISTMAS EVER WENT BY WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE AT WHICH THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD JOINED THE FOURTH OF JULY WAS NEVER PASSED WITHOUT A CELEBRATION
4238-12538-0049 AND SUPPLIED THE MUSICIANS
4238-12538-0050 NOBODY HAD HORSE TEAMS AT THE START WE HAD TO GO WITH OX TEAMS WE COULD NOT MAKE THE TRIP OUT AND BACK IN ONE DAY AND WE DID NOT HAVE MONEY TO PAY HOTEL BILLS
4238-12538-0051 WE MANAGED IN THIS WAY WE WOULD DRIVE OUT PART OF THE WAY AND CAMP THE NEXT MORNING WE WOULD DRIVE INTO TOWN VERY EARLY DO OUR TRADING
4238-12538-0052 AND IF POSSIBLE DRIVE BACK HOME THE SAME DAY IF NOT ABLE TO DO THIS WE CAMPED ON THE ROAD AGAIN BUT IF THE NIGHT WAS NOT TOO DARK WE WOULD REACH HOME THAT NIGHT
4238-12538-0053 AND OH WHAT AN APPETITE WE WOULD HAVE AND HOW BRIGHT THE FIRE WOULD BE
4238-12538-0054 THE TREES AND STUMPS ARE ALL GONE NOW AND BRICK BUILDINGS AND OTHER GOOD HOUSES OCCUPY MUCH OF THE LAND AS MANY PEOPLE NOW LIVE IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT
4238-12538-0055 AS LIVED BOTH EAST AND WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS WHEN THE TERRITORY WAS CREATED IN MARCH OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE INSTEAD OF GOING IN OX TEAMS OR EVEN SLEDS
4238-12538-0056 THE PEOPLE HAVE CARRIAGES OR AUTOMOBILES THEY CAN TRAVEL ON ANY OF THE EIGHTEEN PASSENGER TRAINS THAT PASS DAILY THROUGH PUYALLUP OR ON STREET CARS TO TACOMA AND ALSO
4238-12538-0057 ON SOME OF THE TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR FREIGHT TRAINS SOME OF WHICH ARE A THIRD OF A MILE LONG SUCH ARE SOME OF THE CHANGES WROUGHT IN FIFTY YEARS SINCE PIONEER LIFE BEGAN
