7433-89651-0000 FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES AS GREAT AS THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE MUST NATURALLY BE AND KNOWING THAT IT REMAINS FOR MAN HIMSELF TO REACH HIS HIGHEST STATE OF PERFECTION
7433-89651-0001 WITHOUT ANY SUPERNATURAL INFLUENCE WHATSOEVER THEY THEREFORE ABOLISHED ALL FORMS OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AND ESTABLISHED A CODE OF ETHICS WHICH WAS TERMED NATURAL LAW
7433-89651-0002 RELIGION TEACHES ONE TO BELIEVE IN AN UNNATURAL GOD WHO APPARENTLY MUST BE EVER READY TO ANSWER ANYBODY'S PRAYERFUL CRY AND ACT AS A GENERAL SERVANT TO HUMANITY
7433-89651-0003 BY DISTRIBUTING GOOD THINGS TO THOSE WHO BEG FOR THEM A SORT OF MEDDLESOME GOD WHO ENTERS INTO ALL THE PETTY QUARRELS
7433-89651-0004 THE DEITY WHO CREATED THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE AND ONE WHO DOES NOT DEVIATE FROM HIS ETERNAL AND IMMUTABLE LAWS AN ALL WISE EVERLASTING AND UNCHANGEABLE BEING
7433-89651-0005 HIS POWER UNLIMITED HIS LAWS SUPREME HIS GOODNESS INCALCULABLE NATURAL LAW EXPLAINS THAT HE CREATED THE PRINCIPLE FROM WHICH HUMANITY EVOLVED
7433-89651-0006 BUT THAT IT REMAINS FOR ALL LIVING THINGS TO MAKE BETTER OR WORSE THEIR OWN CONDITIONS
7433-89651-0007 BUT TO CLAIM TO KNOW THE REASONS OF THE CREATOR'S ACTIONS WOULD BE TO ASSUME HIS WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE
7433-89651-0008 NATURAL LAW SETS
7433-89651-0009 GOVERNED BY THE ALMIGHTY THERE IS A REASON FOR ITS EXISTENCE AND A WORK FOR IT TO PERFORM LIKE OTHER BODIES IN SPACE IT CONTAINS PARTICLES OF LIVING MATTER WHICH ARE CONSTANTLY PASSING THROUGH
7433-89651-0010 A COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT WITH METHODICAL CHANGES FROM LIFE TO DEATH AND FROM DEATH TO LIFE BUT WHILE ALL LIVING THINGS LIVE AND DIE
7433-89651-0011 HUMAN BEINGS ARE A SPECIES OF THESE PARTICLES ALL LIVING THINGS ARE COMPOSED OF THREE PARTS MATTER ENERGY AND SOUL THE MATTER IS THE MACHINERY ENERGY THE MOTION
7433-89651-0012 AND SOUL THE ENGINEER THE MIND IS THAT PART OF THE MACHINERY HAVING POWER TO CONTROL ITS MOVEMENTS THE SOUL IS THE SPARK OF LIFE
7433-89651-0013 THE SOUL ALWAYS PURE IS CONTINUALLY STRIVING TO IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF THE MIND THE MIND ALONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE BODY AND THE EVILS ARISING THEREFROM
7433-89651-0014 THE SOUL MERELY ACTING AS ITS INSTRUCTOR FOR GOOD IT IS THE MIND WHICH INHERITS EVIL INSTINCTS AND BUT FOR THE GOOD INFLUENCE OF THE SOUL LIVING CREATURES WOULD NOT EXIST IN HARMONY
7433-89651-0015 AS THE MIND HARDENS AGAINST RIGHTEOUSNESS THE SWAY OF THE SOUL IS LESSENED BUT AS THE MIND SOFTENS TOWARDS GOODNESS THE SOUL INCREASES ITS POWER
7433-89651-0016 THERE IS A CONTINUAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE SOUL FOR GOOD AND THE MIND FOR EVIL
7433-89651-0017 AND ALL LIVING THINGS WILL BE CLEANSED OF IMPURITIES THE BODY INCLUDING THE MIND
7433-89651-0018 THE MATERIAL DISINTEGRATES AND PASSES INTO THE COMPOSITION OF OTHER FORMS THE SOUL NEVER DIES IT REMAINS IN ONE BODY UNTIL ITS COLLAPSE AND THEN TRANSMIGRATES INTO ANOTHER
7433-89651-0019 MAY BE THAT OF A LOWER ANIMAL TOMORROW THEREFORE HE SHOULD USE THE GREATEST KINDNESS AND CONSIDERATION TOWARD ALL LIVING THINGS
7433-89651-0020 THERE IS ONLY A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF MATTER UPON EARTH TO BE MOULDED TOGETHER IN LIVING FORMS
7433-89651-0021 SO THAT WITH THE INCREASE OF MANKIND THERE MUST NATURALLY BE A DECREASE IN THE RANKS OF OTHER ANIMALS HENCE IT REMAINS THE DUTY OF MAN TO EXTEND IN NUMBER
7433-89651-0022 IN EXISTENCE IS UTILIZED BY HUMAN BEINGS
7433-89651-0023 HUMANITY HOWEVER WILL NEVER RISE ABOVE THE SAVAGE STATE UNTIL THE BARBAROUS CUSTOM OF KILLING AND EATING OTHER ANIMALS IS ABOLISHED SELFISHNESS IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL
7433-89651-0024 ERADICATE SELFISHNESS FROM HUMANITY
7433-89651-0025 MAN'S HEAVEN IS HERE ON EARTH IF HE IS ONLY CAPABLE OF MAKING IT SO BUT MEN CANNOT ENJOY HEAVENLY BLESSINGS WITH HELLISH MINDS AND NO SELFISH BEING
7433-89651-0026 CAN PROPERLY ENJOY THE SWEETS OF LIFE THE REAL ESSENCE AND PLEASURE OF LIFE CAN ONLY BE EXTRACTED WHEN MANKIND LABORS
7433-89651-0027 TO OBTAIN THE LARGEST PORTION OF THE EARTH'S BLESSINGS THE PRODUCTION OF THE WORLD MUST BE DIVIDED EQUALLY AMONG ALL HONEST TOILERS
7433-89651-0028 AND MAN'S GREATEST HAPPINESS MUST ARISE FROM SERVING OTHERS INSTEAD OF HIMSELF
7433-89651-0029 THEREFORE ALL HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD WORK TOGETHER AS ONE ENJOYING EQUALLY THE FRUITS OF THEIR COMBINED EFFORTS THE WEAK
7433-89651-0030 THERE MUST BE BUT ONE MASTER THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE BOUND TOGETHER AS ONE
7433-89651-0031 THEN WILL IT RULE THE EARTH AND GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF EXTRANEOUS MATTERS THUS THE WISDOM OF INHABITANTS OF OLDER AND MORE ADVANCED WORLDS WILL BE ATTAINED AND INTERCOURSE WITH THEM PRACTICED
7433-89651-0032 THEREBY UNRAVELING MANY APPARENT MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE IT IS AN ERROR TO SUPPOSE THAT THE DEITY IS YOUR MAKER HE CREATED THE SOURCE FROM WHICH ALL LIVING THINGS SPRUNG
7433-89651-0033 BUT COLLECTIVELY MAN MAKES HIMSELF AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN CONDITIONS IF THE ALMIGHTY WAS YOUR MAKER
7433-89651-0034 SO DO NOT TRY TO SHIFT THE BLAME
7433-89651-0035 THE DEITY CONTROLS THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE MAN CONTROLS HIMSELF DO NOT PRAY YOU CANNOT ALTER THE CREATOR'S PLANS
7433-89651-0036 WHEN CLAIMING THAT HE WANTS TO BE WORSHIPPED
7433-89651-0037 YOU PROFFER INSULTS
7433-89651-0038 WHEN YOU PRETEND TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM
7433-89651-0039 IT IS WITHIN THE POWER OF MANKIND TO PERFECT ITSELF BUT THIS CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE UNSELFISH EFFORTS OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE
7433-89651-0040 AND THEREBY STAMP A GOOD OR BAD IMPRESSION UPON THE LIVES OF HIS DESCENDANTS THE CREATURE WHO PASSES HIS LIFE WITHOUT ADDING TO THE KNOWLEDGE AND GOODNESS OF THE WORLD HAS LIVED FOR NAUGHT
7433-89651-0041 FOR WHICH HIS DESCENDANTS MUST SUFFER
7433-89651-0042 EACH GENERATION SHOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT UPON THE PRECEDING ONE HAVING BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH A PIECE OF LIVING MACHINERY IT IS THE DUTY OF EVERYONE TO GIVE IT THE VERY BEST CARE AND ATTENTION POSSIBLE
7433-89651-0043 THAT ITS VALUE MIGHT BE INCREASED TO NATURE HENCE MORAL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFECTION ARE THE HIGHEST AIMS OF LIFE TO ACHIEVE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE
7433-89651-0044 NO OFF SPRING WHEN ONE OR BOTH OF THEM ARE INSANE
7433-89651-0045 PRACTICE MODERATION IN ALL THINGS THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONGER AND ACQUIRE STRENGTH TO ENJOY NATURAL BLESSINGS AND BESTOW CHARACTER UPON THOSE TO FOLLOW PLEASURE CAN ONLY BE EXTRACTED FROM TEMPERATENESS
