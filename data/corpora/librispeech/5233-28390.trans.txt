5233-28390-0000 EVEN THEN THE MOTHER IS NOT ALLOWED TO SAVE HER CHILD UNLESS SHE CAN FIND A MAN WHO WILL PATRONISE IT AS A FATHER IN WHICH CASE THE MAN IS CONSIDERED AS HAVING APPROPRIATED THE WOMAN TO HIMSELF AND SHE IS ACCORDINGLY EXTRUDED FROM THIS HOPEFUL SOCIETY
5233-28390-0001 THESE FEW ANECDOTES SUFFICIENTLY CHARACTERISE THE WOMEN OF THIS ISLAND
5233-28390-0002 BUT THE ROMAN LADIES IN PERFORMING THE RITES SACRED TO THE GOOD GODDESS WERE EVEN MORE AFRAID OF THE MEN THAN OUR MASONS ARE OF WOMEN FOR WE ARE TOLD BY SOME AUTHORS THAT SO CAUTIOUS WERE THEY OF CONCEALMENT
5233-28390-0003 THAT EVEN THE STATUTES AND PICTURES OF MEN AND OTHER MALE ANIMALS WERE HOOD WINKED WITH A THICK VEIL THE HOUSE OF THE CONSUL THOUGH COMMONLY SO LARGE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY SECURED AGAINST ALL INTRUSION IN SOME REMOTE APARTMENT OF IT WAS OBLIGED TO BE EVACUATED BY ALL MALE ANIMALS
5233-28390-0004 AND EVEN THE CONSUL HIMSELF WAS NOT SUFFERED TO REMAIN IN IT BEFORE THEY BEGAN THEIR CEREMONIES EVERY CORNER AND LURKING PLACE IN THE HOUSE WAS CAREFULLY SEARCHED AND NO CAUTION OMITTED TO PREVENT ALL POSSIBILITY OF BEING DISCOVERED BY IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY
5233-28390-0005 OR DISTURBED BY PRESUMPTIVE INTRUSION BUT THESE CAUTIONS WERE NOT ALL THE GUARD THAT WAS PLACED AROUND THEM THE LAWS OF THE ROMANS MADE IT DEATH FOR ANY MAN TO BE PRESENT AT THE SOLEMNITY
5233-28390-0006 IT WAS ONLY ONCE ATTEMPTED TO BE VIOLATED THOUGH IT EXISTED FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE TILL THE INTRODUCTION OF CHRISTIANITY AND THIS ATTEMPT WAS MADE NOT SO MUCH PERHAPS WITH A VIEW TO BE PRESENT AT THE CEREMONY
5233-28390-0007 POMPEIA THE WIFE OF CAESAR HAVING BEEN SUSPECTED OF A CRIMINAL CORRESPONDENCE WITH CLAUDIUS AND SO CLOSELY WATCHED THAT SHE COULD FIND NO OPPORTUNITY OF GRATIFYING HER PASSION
5233-28390-0008 CLAUDIUS WAS DIRECTED TO COME IN THE HABIT OF A SINGING GIRL A CHARACTER HE COULD EASILY PERSONATE BEING YOUNG AND OF A FAIR COMPLEXION AS SOON AS THE SLAVE SAW HIM ENTER SHE RAN TO INFORM HER MISTRESS
5233-28390-0009 THE MISTRESS EAGER TO MEET HER LOVER IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE COMPANY AND THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS
5233-28390-0010 UPON WHICH HE LEFT HER AND BEGAN TO TAKE A WALK THROUGH THE ROOMS ALWAYS AVOIDING THE LIGHT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHILE HE WAS THUS WALKING BY HIMSELF A MAID SERVANT ACCOSTED HIM AND DESIRED HIM TO SING
5233-28390-0011 HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER BUT SHE FOLLOWED AND URGING HIM SO CLOSELY THAT HE WAS AT LAST OBLIGED TO SPEAK HIS VOICE BETRAYED HIS SEX THE MAID SERVANT SHRIEKED AND RUNNING INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE RITES WERE PERFORMING TOLD THAT A MAN WAS IN THE HOUSE
5233-28390-0012 ORDERED THE DOORS TO BE SECURED AND WITH LIGHTS IN THEIR HANDS RAN ABOUT THE HOUSE SEARCHING FOR THE SACRILEGIOUS INTRUDER THEY FOUND HIM IN THE APARTMENT OF THE SLAVE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM
5233-28390-0013 AND THOUGH IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IMMEDIATELY DISPERSED TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT TO THEIR HUSBANDS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED CLAUDIUS WAS SOON AFTER ACCUSED OF HAVING PROFANED THE HOLY RITES BUT THE POPULACE DECLARING IN HIS FAVOR
5233-28390-0014 THE JUDGES FEARING AN INSURRECTION WERE OBLIGED TO ACQUIT HIM
5233-28390-0015 THERE IS AMONGST US A FEMALE CHARACTER NOT UNCOMMON WHICH WE DENOMINATE THE OUTRAGEOUSLY VIRTUOUS
