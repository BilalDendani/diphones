3318-164984-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN LITTLE MOK AMONG ALL THE CHILDREN OF AB AND REMARKABLE IT WAS FOR THE AGE THE BEST LOVED WAS LITTLE MOK THE ELDEST SON WHEN THE CHILD STRONG AND JOYOUS WAS SCARCELY TWO YEARS OLD
3318-164984-0001 HE FELL FROM A LEDGE OFF THE CLIFF WHERE HE HAD CLIMBED TO PLAY AND BOTH HIS LEGS WERE BROKEN
3318-164984-0002 THE MOTHER LOVE OF LIGHTFOOT WARDED OFF THE LAST PITILESS BLOW OF NATURE ALTHOUGH THE CHILD A HOPELESS CRIPPLE NEVER AFTER WALKED
3318-164984-0003 THE NAME LITTLE MOK WAS NATURALLY GIVEN HIM AND BEFORE LONG THE CHILD HAD WON THE HEART AS WELL AS THE NAME OF THE LIMPING OLD MAKER OF AXES SPEARHEADS AND ARROWS THE CLOSER TIES OF FAMILY LIFE AS WE KNOW THEM NOW EXISTED BUT IN THEIR OUTLINES TO THE CAVE MAN
3318-164984-0004 THE MAN AND WOMAN WERE FAITHFUL TO EACH OTHER WITH THE FIDELITY OF THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND THEIR CHILDREN WERE CARED FOR WITH ROUGH TENDERNESS IN THEIR INFANCY THE TIME OF ABSOLUTE DEPENDENCE WAS MADE VERY SHORT THOUGH AND CHILDREN VERY EARLY WERE REQUIRED TO FIND SOME OF THEIR OWN FOOD
3318-164984-0005 AND TAUGHT BY NECESSITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BUT LITTLE MOK UNABLE TO TAKE UP FOR HIMSELF THE BURDEN OF AN INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE WAS NOT SLAIN NOR LEFT TO DIE OF NEGLECT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANOTHER CHILD THUS CRIPPLED IN THE TIME IN WHICH HE LIVED
3318-164984-0006 HE ONCE SPARED GREW INTO THE WILD HEARTS OF THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM AND BECAME THE GUARDED AND CHERISHED ONE OF THE RUDE HOME OF AB AND LIGHTFOOT AND TO HIM WAS THUS GIVEN THE CONTINUOUS LOVE AND CARE WHICH THE STRONG LIMBED BOYS AND GIRLS OF THE FAMILY LOST AND NEVER MISSED
3318-164984-0007 IT WAS A STRANGE THING FOR THE TIME THE CHILD HAD QUALITIES OTHER THAN THE NEGATIVE ONES OF HELPLESSNESS AND WEAKNESS WITH WHICH TO BIND TO HIM THE HEARTS OF THOSE AROUND HIM BUT THE PRIMARY FACT OF HIS ENTIRE DEPENDENCE UPON THEM
3318-164984-0008 WAS WHAT MADE HIM THE CENTER OF THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF UNTAUGHT UNTAMED CAVE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE FIRE VALLEY HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST CHILD EVER SO CHERISHED FROM SUCH IMPULSE
3318-164984-0009 FROM HIS MOTHER THE CHILD INHERITED A JOYOUS DISPOSITION WHICH NOTHING COULD SUBDUE OFTEN ON THE RETURN HOME FROM SOME LITTLE EXPEDITION ON WHICH IT HAD BEEN PRACTICABLE TO TAKE HIM
3318-164984-0010 HIS SILENT SOMEWHAT BROODING GRANDFATHER THE LITTLE BROWN BOY MADE THE WOODS RING WITH SHRILL BIRD CALLS OR THE MIMICRY OF ANIMALS AND EVER HIS LAUGHTER FILLED THE SPACES IN BETWEEN THESE SOUNDS
3318-164984-0011 OTHER CHILDREN FLOCKED AROUND THE MERRY YOUNGSTER SEEKING TO EMULATE HIS PLAY OF VOICE AND THE OLDSTERS SMILED AS THEY SAW AND HEARD THE JOYOUS CONFUSION ABOUT THE TINY REVELER THE EXCURSIONS TO THE RIVER WERE LITTLE MOK'S CHIEF DELIGHT FROM HIS EARLY CHILDHOOD
3318-164984-0012 AND WHEN THE FISHING PARTY LEFT THE FIRE CAMP IT WAS INCOMPLETE IF LITTLE MOK WAS NOT CARRIED LIGHTLY AT THE VAN THE LIFE AND JOY OF THE OCCASION NO ONE EVER FORGOT THE DAY WHEN LITTLE MOK THEN ABOUT SIX YEARS OLD CAUGHT HIS FIRST FISH
3318-164984-0013 HIS JOY AND PRIDE INFECTED ALL AS HE EXHIBITED HIS PRIZE AND BOASTED OF WHAT HE WOULD CATCH IN THE RIVER NEXT AND WHEN ON THE RETURN OLD MOK SALUTED HIM AS THE GREAT FISHERMAN THE ELF'S ELATION BECAME TOO GREAT FOR ANY EXPRESSION
3318-164984-0014 HIS LITTLE CHEST HEAVED HIS EYES FLASHED AND THEN HE WRIGGLED FROM LIGHTFOOT'S ARMS INTO THE LAP OF OLD MOK SNUGGLED DOWN INTO THE OLD MAN'S FURS AND HID HIS FACE THERE AND THE TWO UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER
3318-164984-0015 IT WAS SOON AFTER THIS GREAT EVENT OF THE FIRST FISH CATCHING THAT RED SPOT AB'S MOTHER DIED SHE HAD NEVER QUITE ADAPTED HERSELF TO THE NEW LIFE IN THE FIRE VALLEY AND AFTER A TIME SHE BEGAN TO GROW OLD VERY FAST
3318-164984-0016 AT LAST A FEVER ATTACKED HER AND THE END OF HER PATIENT BUSY LIFE CAME AFTER HER DEATH ONE EAR WAS MUCH IN OLD MOK'S CAVE THE TWO HAD SO LONG BEEN FRIENDS THERE WITH THEM THE CRIPPLED BOY WAS OFTEN TO BE FOUND HE WAS NOT ALWAYS GAY AND JOYOUS
3318-164984-0017 SOMETIMES HE LAY FOR DAYS ON HIS BED OF LEAVES AT HOME IN WEAKNESS AND PAIN SILENT AND UNLIKE HIMSELF THEN WHEN LIGHTFOOT'S CARE HAD GIVEN HIM BACK A LITTLE STRENGTH HE WOULD BEG TO BE TAKEN TO OLD MOK'S CAVE
3318-164984-0018 AND FINALLY HE CLAIMED AND WAS ALLOWED A NEST OF HIS OWN IN THE WARMEST AND DARKEST NOOK OF OLD MOK'S DEN WHERE HE SLEPT EVERY NIGHT AND SOMETIMES A GOOD PART OF THE DAY WHEN ONE OF HIS TIMES OF PAIN AND WEAKNESS WAS UPON HIM
3318-164984-0019 WHILE AB MOK AND ONE EAR BENT OVER THEIR WORK AT ARROWHEAD OR SPEAR POINT AND TALKED OF WHAT MIGHT BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE WEAPONS UPON WHICH SO MUCH DEPENDED HERE WHEN NO ONE ELSE REMAINED IN THE WEARY DARKNESS OF NIGHT AND THE HALF LIGHT OF STORMY DAYS
3318-164984-0020 OLD MOK BEGUILED THE TIME WITH STORIES AND SOMETIMES IN A HOARSE VOICE EVEN ATTEMPTED TO CHANT TO HIS LITTLE HEARER SNATCHES OF THE WILD SINGING TALES OF THE SHELL PEOPLE FOR THE SHELL PEOPLE HAD A SORT OF STORY SONG
3318-164984-0021 ONCE WHEN LIGHTFOOT SAT BY OLD MOK'S FIRE SHE TOLD THEM OF THE TIME WHEN SHE AND AB FOUND THEMSELVES OUTSIDE THEIR CAVE UNARMED WITH A BEAR TO BE EATEN THROUGH BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO THEIR DOOR
3318-164984-0022 AND LITTLE MOK SURPRISED HIS MOTHER AND OLD MOK BY AN OUTBURST OF LAUGHTER AT THE TALE HE HAD A GLIMMERING OF HUMOR AND SAW THE DROLL SIDE OF THE ADVENTURE A VIEW WHICH HAD NOT OCCURRED TO LIGHTFOOT NOR TO AB THE LITTLE LAD OF THE WORLD YET NOT IN IT
3318-164984-0023 SAW VAGUELY THE SURPRISES LIGHTS AND SHADES AND CONTRASTS OF EXISTENCE AND SOMETIMES THEY MADE HIM LAUGH THE LAUGH OF THE CAVE MAN WAS NOT A COMMON EVENT AND WHEN IT CAME WAS LIKELY TO BE SOBER AND SARDONIC
3318-164984-0024 AT LEAST IT WAS SO WHEN NOT SIMPLY AN EVIDENCE OF RUDE HEALTH AND HIGH ANIMAL SPIRITS HUMOR IS ONE OF THE LATEST AS IT IS ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS GRAINS SHAKEN OUT OF TIME'S HOUR GLASS
3318-164984-0025 BUT LITTLE MOK SOMEHOW CAUGHT A TINY BIT OF THE RAINBOW GIFT LONG BEFORE ITS TIME IN THE WORLD AND SOON WITH HIM IT WAS TO DISAPPEAR FOR CENTURIES TO COME ONE DAY WHEN LITTLE MOK WAS BROUGHT BACK FROM AN EXPEDITION TO THE RIVER
3318-164984-0026 HE TOLD OLD MOK HOW HE HAD SAT LONG ON THE BANK TOO TIRED TO FISH AND HAD JUST RESTED AND FEASTED HIS EYES ON THE WOOD THE STREAM THE SMALL DARTING CREATURES IN IT THE BIRDS AND THE ANIMALS WHICH CAME TO DRINK
3318-164984-0027 DESCRIBING A HERD OF REINDEER WHICH HAD PASSED NEAR HIM LITTLE MOK TOOK UP A PIECE OF OLD MOK'S RED CHALKSTONE AND ON THE WALL OF THE CAVE DREW A PICTURE OF THE ANIMAL THE VETERAN STARED IN SURPRISE THE PICTURE WAS WONDERFULLY LIFE LIKE IN GRASP AND DETAIL
3318-164984-0028 THE CHILD OWNED THAT GREAT GIFT THE MEMORY OF SIGHT AND HIS HAND WAS CUNNING ENCOURAGED BY HIS SUCCESS THE BOY DREW ON DELIGHTING OLD MOK WITH HIS SINGULAR FIDELITY AND SKILL THEN CAME HOURS AND DAYS OF SKETCHING AND ETCHING IN THE OLD MAN'S CAVE
3318-164984-0029 THE MASTER WAS DELIGHTED HE BROUGHT OUT FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES HIS CHOICEST PIECES OF MAMMOTH TUSK OR TEETH OF THE RIVER HORSE FOR LITTLE MOK'S ETCHINGS AND CARVINGS AND AS TIME PASSED THE YOUNG ARTIST EXCELLED THE OLD ONE AND BECAME THE PRIDE AND BOAST OF HIS FRIEND AND TEACHER
3318-164984-0030 SOMETIMES THE LITTLE LAD WOULD WORK FAR INTO THE NIGHT FOR HE COULD NOT PAUSE WHEN HE HAD BEGUN A THING UNTIL IT WAS COMPLETE BUT THEN HE WOULD SLEEP IN HIS WARM NEST UNTIL NOON THE NEXT DAY CRAWLING OUT TO COOK A BIT OF MEAT FOR HIMSELF AT THE NEAREST FIRE OR
3318-164984-0031 SHARING OLD MOK'S MEAL AS WAS MORE CONVENIENT WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE FIRE VALLEY WAS GROWING DEVELOPING AND FLOURISHING LITTLE MOK'S FRAIL BODY HAD EVER GROWN BUT SLOWLY AND ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF HIS TWELFTH YEAR
3318-164984-0032 HIS CHERISHED EXCURSIONS TO THE RIVER EVEN HIS LITTLE JOURNEYS ON OLD ONE EAR'S STRONG ARM TO THE CLIFF TOP FROM WHENCE HE COULD SEE THE WHOLE WORLD AT ONCE HAD ALL TO BE ABANDONED
3318-164984-0033 WHEN THE WINTER SNOWS BEGAN TO WHIRL IN THE AIR LITTLE MOK WAS LYING QUIETLY ON HIS BED HIS GREAT EYES LOOKING WISTFULLY UP AT LIGHTFOOT WHO IN VAIN TAXED HER LIMITED SKILL AND RESOURCES TO TEMPT HIM TO EAT AND BECOME MORE STURDY
3318-164984-0034 SHE HOVERED OVER HIM LIKE A DISTRESSED MOTHER BIRD OVER ITS YOUNGLING FALLEN FROM THE NEST BUT WITH ALL HER EFFORTS SHE COULD NOT BRING BACK EVEN HIS USUAL SLIGHT MEASURE OF HEALTH AND STRENGTH TO THE POOR LITTLE MOK
3318-164984-0035 AB CAME SOMETIMES AND LOOKED SADLY AT THE TWO AND THEN WALKED MOODILY AWAY A GREAT WEIGHT ON HIS BREAST OLD MOK WAS ALWAYS AT WORK AND YET ALWAYS READY TO GIVE LITTLE MOK WATER OR TURN HIS WEARY LITTLE FRAME ON ITS RUDE BED
3318-164984-0036 OR SPREAD THE FURS OVER THE WASTED BODY AND ALWAYS LIGHTFOOT WAITED AND HOPED AND FEARED AND AT LAST LITTLE MOK DIED AND WAS BURIED UNDER THE STONES AND THE SNOW FELL OVER THE LONELY CAIRN UNDER THE FIR TREES OUTSIDE THE FIRE VALLEY WHERE HIS GRAVE WAS MADE
3318-164984-0037 LIGHTFOOT WAS SILENT AND SAD AND COULD NOT SMILE NOR LAUGH ANY MORE SHE LONGED FOR LITTLE MOK AND DID NOT EAT OR SLEEP ONE NIGHT AB TRYING TO COMFORT HER SAID YOU WILL SEE HIM AGAIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED LIGHTFOOT
3318-164984-0038 AND AB ONLY ANSWERED YOU WILL SEE HIM HE WILL COME AT NIGHT GO TO SLEEP AND YOU WILL SEE HIM BUT LIGHTFOOT COULD NOT SLEEP YET AND FOR MANY A NIGHT HER EYES CLOSED ONLY WHEN EXTREME FATIGUE COMPELLED SLEEP TOWARD THE MORNING
3318-164984-0039 AND AT LAST AFTER MANY DAYS AND NIGHTS LIGHTFOOT WHEN ASLEEP SAW LITTLE MOK JUST AS IN LIFE SHE SAW HIM WITH ALL HIS FAMILIAR LOOKS AND MOTIONS BUT HE DID NOT STAY LONG
3318-164984-0040 AND AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE SAW HIM AND IT COMFORTED HER SOMEWHAT BECAUSE HE SMILED THERE HAD COME TO HER SUCH A HEARTACHE ABOUT HIM LYING OUT THERE UNDER THE SNOW AND STONES WITH NO ONE TO CARE FOR HIM THAT THE SMILE WARMED HER HEAVY HEART AND SHE TOLD AB THAT SHE HAD SEEN LITTLE MOK
3318-164984-0041 ONLY WHISPERING IT TO HIM FOR IT WAS NOT WELL SHE KNEW TO TALK ABOUT SUCH THINGS AND SHE WHISPERED TO AB TOO HER ANGUISH THAT LITTLE MOK ONLY CAME AT NIGHT AND NEVER WHEN IT WAS DAY BUT SHE DID NOT COMPLAIN SHE ONLY SAID I WANT TO SEE HIM IN THE DAYTIME
3318-164984-0042 AND AB COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY BUT THAT MADE HIM THINK MORE AND MORE HE FELT DRAWN CLOSER TO LIGHTFOOT HIS WIFE NO LONGER A YOUNG GIRL BUT THE MOTHER OF LITTLE MOK WHO WAS DEAD AND OF ALL HIS CHILDREN
3318-164984-0043 IN HIS MIND AROSE VAGUELY OBSCURE YET PERSISTENT THE IDEA THAT BRUTE STRENGTH AND VIGOR KEEN SENSES AND RECKLESS BRAVERY WERE NOT AFTER ALL THE SOLE QUALITIES THAT MAKE AND INFLUENCE MEN OLD MOK CRIPPLED AND DISABLED FOR THE HUNT AND DEFENSE
3318-164984-0044 WAS NEVERTHELESS A POWER NOT TO BE DESPISED AND LITTLE MOK THE HELPLESS CHILD HAD BEEN STILL STRONG ENOUGH TO WIN AND KEEP THE LOVE OF ALL THE STALWART AND ROUGH CAVE PEOPLE AB WAS SORRY FOR LIGHTFOOT
