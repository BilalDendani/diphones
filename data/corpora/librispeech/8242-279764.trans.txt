8242-279764-0000 THERE WAS ONCE A VERY RICH MERCHANT WHO HAD SIX CHILDREN THREE BOYS AND THREE GIRLS AS HE WAS HIMSELF A MAN OF GREAT SENSE HE SPARED NO EXPENSE FOR THEIR EDUCATION THE THREE DAUGHTERS WERE ALL HANDSOME
8242-279764-0001 INDEED SHE WAS SO VERY BEAUTIFUL THAT IN HER CHILDHOOD EVERY ONE CALLED HER THE LITTLE BEAUTY AND BEING EQUALLY LOVELY WHEN SHE WAS GROWN UP NOBODY CALLED HER BY ANY OTHER NAME WHICH MADE HER SISTERS VERY JEALOUS OF HER
8242-279764-0002 THIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER WAS NOT ONLY MORE HANDSOME THAN HER SISTERS BUT ALSO WAS BETTER TEMPERED THE TWO ELDEST WERE VAIN OF THEIR WEALTH AND POSITION THEY GAVE THEMSELVES A THOUSAND AIRS AND REFUSED TO VISIT OTHER MERCHANTS DAUGHTERS
8242-279764-0003 NOR WOULD THEY CONDESCEND TO BE SEEN EXCEPT WITH PERSONS OF QUALITY THEY WENT EVERY DAY TO BALLS PLAYS AND PUBLIC WALKS AND ALWAYS MADE GAME OF THEIR YOUNGEST SISTER FOR SPENDING HER TIME IN READING OR OTHER USEFUL EMPLOYMENTS
8242-279764-0004 AS IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT THESE YOUNG LADIES WOULD HAVE LARGE FORTUNES MANY GREAT MERCHANTS WISHED TO GET THEM FOR WIVES
8242-279764-0005 BUT THE TWO ELDEST ALWAYS ANSWERED THAT FOR THEIR PARTS THEY HAD NO THOUGHTS OF MARRYING ANY ONE BELOW A DUKE OR AN EARL AT LEAST BEAUTY HAD QUITE AS MANY OFFERS AS HER SISTERS BUT SHE ALWAYS ANSWERED WITH THE GREATEST CIVILITY
8242-279764-0006 MY CHILDREN WE MUST NOW GO AND DWELL IN THE COTTAGE AND TRY TO GET A LIVING BY LABOUR FOR WE HAVE NO OTHER MEANS OF SUPPORT
8242-279764-0007 THE TWO ELDEST REPLIED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO WORK AND WOULD NOT LEAVE TOWN FOR THEY HAD LOVERS ENOUGH WHO WOULD BE GLAD TO MARRY THEM THOUGH THEY HAD NO LONGER ANY FORTUNE BUT IN THIS THEY WERE MISTAKEN
8242-279764-0008 FOR WHEN THE LOVERS HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY SAID THE GIRLS WERE SO PROUD AND ILL TEMPERED THAT ALL WE WANTED WAS THEIR FORTUNE WE ARE NOT SORRY AT ALL TO SEE THEIR PRIDE BROUGHT DOWN
8242-279764-0009 BUT BEAUTY STILL REFUSED AND SAID SHE COULD NOT THINK OF LEAVING HER POOR FATHER IN THIS TROUBLE AT FIRST BEAUTY COULD NOT HELP SOMETIMES CRYING IN SECRET FOR THE HARDSHIPS SHE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO SUFFER BUT IN A VERY SHORT TIME SHE SAID TO HERSELF
8242-279764-0010 ALL THE CRYING IN THE WORLD WILL DO ME NO GOOD SO I WILL TRY TO BE HAPPY WITHOUT A FORTUNE WHEN THEY HAD REMOVED TO THEIR COTTAGE THE MERCHANT AND HIS THREE SONS EMPLOYED THEMSELVES IN PLOUGHING AND SOWING THE FIELDS AND WORKING IN THE GARDEN
8242-279764-0011 AND THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP INDEED THE WORK GREATLY BENEFITED HER HEALTH WHEN SHE HAD DONE SHE USED TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH READING PLAYING HER MUSIC OR SINGING WHILE SHE SPUN BUT HER TWO SISTERS WERE AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO TO PASS THE TIME AWAY
8242-279764-0012 THEY HAD THEIR BREAKFAST IN BED AND DID NOT RISE TILL TEN O'CLOCK THEN THEY COMMONLY WALKED OUT BUT ALWAYS FOUND THEMSELVES VERY SOON TIRED WHEN THEY WOULD OFTEN SIT DOWN UNDER A SHADY TREE AND GRIEVE FOR THE LOSS OF THEIR CARRIAGE AND FINE CLOTHES
8242-279764-0013 AND SAY TO EACH OTHER WHAT A MEAN SPIRITED POOR STUPID CREATURE OUR YOUNG SISTER IS TO BE SO CONTENT WITH THIS LOW WAY OF LIFE BUT THEIR FATHER THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY AND LOVED AND ADMIRED HIS YOUNGEST CHILD MORE THAN EVER
8242-279764-0014 AFTER THEY HAD LIVED IN THIS MANNER ABOUT A YEAR THE MERCHANT RECEIVED A LETTER WHICH INFORMED HIM THAT ONE OF HIS RICHEST SHIPS WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS LOST HAD JUST COME INTO PORT THIS NEWS MADE THE TWO ELDEST SISTERS ALMOST MAD WITH JOY
8242-279764-0015 BUT BEAUTY ASKED FOR NOTHING FOR SHE THOUGHT IN HERSELF THAT ALL THE SHIP WAS WORTH WOULD HARDLY BUY EVERYTHING HER SISTERS WISHED FOR BEAUTY SAID THE MERCHANT HOW COMES IT THAT YOU ASK FOR NOTHING WHAT CAN I BRING YOU MY CHILD
8242-279764-0016 SINCE YOU ARE SO KIND AS TO THINK OF ME DEAR FATHER SHE ANSWERED I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD BRING ME A ROSE FOR WE HAVE NONE IN OUR GARDEN NOW BEAUTY DID NOT INDEED WISH FOR A ROSE
8242-279764-0017 OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE SAID SHE WANTED HER FATHER TO PRAISE HER FOR DESIRING NOTHING THE MERCHANT TOOK HIS LEAVE OF THEM AND SET OUT ON HIS JOURNEY BUT WHEN HE GOT TO THE SHIP SOME PERSONS WENT TO LAW WITH HIM ABOUT THE CARGO
8242-279764-0018 AND AFTER A DEAL OF TROUBLE HE CAME BACK TO HIS COTTAGE AS POOR AS HE HAD LEFT IT WHEN HE WAS WITHIN THIRTY MILES OF HIS HOME AND THINKING OF THE JOY OF AGAIN MEETING HIS CHILDREN HE LOST HIS WAY IN THE MIDST OF A DENSE FOREST
8242-279764-0019 IT RAINED AND SNOWED VERY HARD AND BESIDES THE WIND WAS SO HIGH AS TO THROW HIM TWICE FROM HIS HORSE NIGHT CAME ON AND HE FEARED HE SHOULD DIE OF COLD AND HUNGER OR BE TORN TO PIECES BY THE WOLVES THAT HE HEARD HOWLING ROUND HIM
8242-279764-0020 ALL AT ONCE HE CAST HIS EYES TOWARDS A LONG AVENUE AND SAW AT THE END A LIGHT BUT IT SEEMED A GREAT WAY OFF HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY TOWARDS IT AND FOUND THAT IT CAME FROM A SPLENDID PALACE
8242-279764-0021 THE WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE ALL BLAZING WITH LIGHT IT HAD GREAT BRONZE GATES STANDING WIDE OPEN AND FINE COURT YARDS THROUGH WHICH THE MERCHANT PASSED BUT NOT A LIVING SOUL WAS TO BE SEEN
8242-279764-0022 THERE WERE STABLES TOO WHICH HIS POOR STARVED HORSE LESS SCRUPULOUS THAN HIMSELF ENTERED AT ONCE AND TOOK A GOOD MEAL OF OATS AND HAY HIS MASTER THEN TIED HIM UP AND WALKED TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE HALL
8242-279764-0023 BUT STILL WITHOUT SEEING A SINGLE CREATURE HE WENT ON TO A LARGE DINING PARLOUR WHERE HE FOUND A GOOD FIRE AND A TABLE COVERED WITH SOME VERY NICE DISHES BUT ONLY ONE PLATE WITH A KNIFE AND FORK
8242-279764-0024 AS THE SNOW AND RAIN HAD WETTED HIM TO THE SKIN HE WENT UP TO THE FIRE TO DRY HIMSELF I HOPE SAID HE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE OR HIS SERVANTS WILL EXCUSE ME
8242-279764-0025 HELPED HIMSELF TO A CHICKEN AND TO A FEW GLASSES OF WINE YET ALL THE TIME TREMBLING WITH FEAR HE SAT TILL THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND THEN TAKING COURAGE BEGAN TO THINK HE MIGHT AS WELL LOOK ABOUT HIM
8242-279764-0026 SO HE OPENED A DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AND WENT THROUGH IT INTO A VERY GRAND ROOM IN WHICH THERE WAS A FINE BED AND AS HE WAS FEELING VERY WEARY HE SHUT THE DOOR TOOK OFF HIS CLOTHES AND GOT INTO IT
8242-279764-0027 IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BEFORE HE AWOKE WHEN HE WAS AMAZED TO SEE A HANDSOME NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES LAID READY FOR HIM INSTEAD OF HIS OWN WHICH WERE ALL TORN AND SPOILED TO BE SURE SAID HE TO HIMSELF
8242-279764-0028 THIS PLACE BELONGS TO SOME GOOD FAIRY WHO HAS TAKEN PITY ON MY ILL LUCK HE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND INSTEAD OF THE SNOW COVERED WOOD WHERE HE HAD LOST HIMSELF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT HE SAW THE MOST CHARMING ARBOURS COVERED WITH ALL KINDS OF FLOWERS
8242-279764-0029 RETURNING TO THE HALL WHERE HE HAD SUPPED HE FOUND A BREAKFAST TABLE READY PREPARED INDEED MY GOOD FAIRY SAID THE MERCHANT ALOUD I AM VASTLY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR KIND CARE OF ME HE THEN MADE A HEARTY BREAKFAST
8242-279764-0030 TOOK HIS HAT AND WAS GOING TO THE STABLE TO PAY HIS HORSE A VISIT BUT AS HE PASSED UNDER ONE OF THE ARBOURS WHICH WAS LOADED WITH ROSES HE THOUGHT OF WHAT BEAUTY HAD ASKED HIM TO BRING BACK TO HER AND SO HE TOOK A BUNCH OF ROSES TO CARRY HOME
8242-279764-0031 AT THE SAME MOMENT HE HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND SAW COMING TOWARDS HIM A BEAST SO FRIGHTFUL TO LOOK AT THAT HE WAS READY TO FAINT WITH FEAR
8242-279764-0032 THE MERCHANT FELL ON HIS KNEES AND CLASPING HIS HANDS SAID SIR I HUMBLY BEG YOUR PARDON I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD OFFEND YOU TO GATHER A ROSE FOR ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS WHO HAD ENTREATED ME TO BRING HER ONE HOME
8242-279764-0033 DO NOT KILL ME MY LORD
8242-279764-0034 BUT A BEAST REPLIED THE MONSTER
8242-279764-0035 YOU TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE DAUGHTERS NOW I SUFFER YOU TO ESCAPE IF ONE OF THEM WILL COME AND DIE IN YOUR STEAD IF NOT PROMISE THAT YOU WILL YOURSELF RETURN IN THREE MONTHS TO BE DEALT WITH AS I MAY CHOOSE
8242-279764-0036 THE TENDER HEARTED MERCHANT HAD NO THOUGHTS OF LETTING ANY ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS DIE FOR HIS SAKE BUT HE KNEW THAT IF HE SEEMED TO ACCEPT THE BEAST'S TERMS HE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM ONCE AGAIN
8242-279764-0037 HE FILLED THE CHEST WITH THEM TO THE VERY BRIM LOCKED IT AND MOUNTING HIS HORSE LEFT THE PALACE AS SORROWFUL AS HE HAD BEEN GLAD WHEN HE FIRST BEHELD IT THE HORSE TOOK A PATH ACROSS THE FOREST OF HIS OWN ACCORD
8242-279764-0038 I AM OLD AND CANNOT EXPECT TO LIVE MUCH LONGER SO I SHALL BUT GIVE UP A FEW YEARS OF MY LIFE AND SHALL ONLY GRIEVE FOR THE SAKE OF MY CHILDREN NEVER FATHER CRIED BEAUTY
8242-279764-0039 IF YOU GO BACK TO THE PALACE YOU CANNOT HINDER MY GOING AFTER YOU THOUGH YOUNG I AM NOT OVER FOND OF LIFE AND I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE EATEN UP BY THE MONSTER THAN DIE OF GRIEF FOR YOUR LOSS
8242-279764-0040 THE MERCHANT IN VAIN TRIED TO REASON WITH BEAUTY WHO STILL OBSTINATELY KEPT TO HER PURPOSE WHICH IN TRUTH MADE HER TWO SISTERS GLAD FOR THEY WERE JEALOUS OF HER BECAUSE EVERYBODY LOVED HER
8242-279764-0041 THE MERCHANT WAS SO GRIEVED AT THE THOUGHTS OF LOSING HIS CHILD THAT HE NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF THE CHEST FILLED WITH GOLD BUT AT NIGHT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE HE FOUND IT STANDING BY HIS BEDSIDE
8242-279764-0042 HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT HIS RICHES TO HIS ELDEST DAUGHTERS
8242-279764-0043 BUT HE TOLD BEAUTY HIS SECRET AND SHE THEN SAID THAT WHILE HE WAS AWAY
8242-279764-0044 WHO HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER TWO SISTERS SHE ENTREATED HER FATHER TO MARRY THEM WITHOUT DELAY FOR SHE WAS SO SWEET NATURED SHE ONLY WISHED THEM TO BE HAPPY THREE MONTHS WENT BY
8242-279764-0045 ONLY TOO FAST AND THEN THE MERCHANT AND BEAUTY GOT READY TO SET OUT FOR THE PALACE OF THE BEAST UPON THIS THE TWO SISTERS RUBBED THEIR EYES WITH AN ONION TO MAKE BELIEVE THEY WERE CRYING BOTH THE MERCHANT AND HIS SONS CRIED IN EARNEST
8242-279764-0046 ONLY BEAUTY SHED NO TEARS THEY REACHED THE PALACE IN A VERY FEW HOURS AND THE HORSE WITHOUT BIDDING WENT INTO THE SAME STABLE AS BEFORE THE MERCHANT AND BEAUTY WALKED TOWARDS THE LARGE HALL
8242-279764-0047 WHERE THEY FOUND A TABLE COVERED WITH EVERY DAINTY AND TWO PLATES LAID READY THE MERCHANT HAD VERY LITTLE APPETITE BUT BEAUTY THAT SHE MIGHT THE BETTER HIDE HER GRIEF PLACED HERSELF AT THE TABLE AND HELPED HER FATHER
8242-279764-0048 SHE THEN BEGAN TO EAT HERSELF AND THOUGHT ALL THE TIME THAT TO BE SURE THE BEAST HAD A MIND TO FATTEN HER BEFORE HE ATE HER UP SINCE HE HAD PROVIDED SUCH GOOD CHEER FOR HER WHEN THEY HAD DONE THEIR SUPPER THEY HEARD A GREAT NOISE
8242-279764-0049 AND THE GOOD OLD MAN BEGAN TO BID HIS POOR CHILD FAREWELL FOR HE KNEW IT WAS THE BEAST COMING TO THEM WHEN BEAUTY FIRST SAW THAT FRIGHTFUL FORM SHE WAS VERY MUCH TERRIFIED BUT TRIED TO HIDE HER FEAR
8242-279764-0050 THE CREATURE WALKED UP TO HER AND EYED HER ALL OVER THEN ASKED HER IN A DREADFUL VOICE IF SHE HAD COME QUITE OF HER OWN ACCORD YES SAID BEAUTY THEN YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL AND I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
8242-279764-0051 SHE ANSWERED AS THE MONSTER SHUFFLED OUT OF THE ROOM AH MY DEAR CHILD SAID THE MERCHANT KISSING HIS DAUGHTER I AM HALF DEAD ALREADY AT THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING YOU WITH THIS DREADFUL BEAST YOU SHALL GO BACK
8242-279764-0052 AND LET ME STAY IN YOUR PLACE NO SAID BEAUTY BOLDLY I WILL NEVER AGREE TO THAT YOU MUST GO HOME TO MORROW MORNING THEY THEN WISHED EACH OTHER GOOD NIGHT
8242-279764-0053 AND WENT TO BED BOTH OF THEM THINKING THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CLOSE THEIR EYES BUT AS SOON AS EVER THEY HAD LAIN DOWN THEY FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
8242-279764-0054 BEAUTY DREAMED THAT A LADY CAME UP TO HER WHO SAID
8242-279764-0055 DO NOT BE AFRAID OF ANYTHING
8242-279764-0056 AS SOON AS BEAUTY AWOKE SHE TOLD HER FATHER THIS DREAM BUT THOUGH IT GAVE HIM SOME COMFORT HE WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE HE COULD BE PERSUADED TO LEAVE THE PALACE AT LAST BEAUTY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIM SAFELY AWAY
8242-279764-0057 WHEN HER FATHER WAS OUT OF SIGHT POOR BEAUTY BEGAN TO WEEP SORELY STILL HAVING NATURALLY A COURAGEOUS SPIRIT SHE SOON RESOLVED NOT TO MAKE HER SAD CASE STILL WORSE BY SORROW WHICH SHE KNEW WAS VAIN
8242-279764-0058 BUT TO WAIT AND BE PATIENT SHE WALKED ABOUT TO TAKE A VIEW OF ALL THE PALACE AND THE ELEGANCE OF EVERY PART OF IT MUCH CHARMED HER BUT WHAT WAS HER SURPRISE WHEN SHE CAME TO A DOOR ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN BEAUTY'S ROOM
8242-279764-0059 SHE OPENED IT IN HASTE AND HER EYES WERE DAZZLED BY THE SPLENDOUR AND TASTE OF THE APARTMENT WHAT MADE HER WONDER MORE THAN ALL THE REST WAS A LARGE LIBRARY FILLED WITH BOOKS A HARPSICHORD
8242-279764-0060 BEAUTEOUS LADY DRY YOUR TEARS HERE'S NO CAUSE FOR SIGHS OR FEARS
8242-279764-0061 FOR YOU COMMAND AND I OBEY ALAS SAID SHE SIGHING I WISH I COULD ONLY COMMAND A SIGHT OF MY POOR FATHER AND TO KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING AT THIS MOMENT
8242-279764-0062 JUST THEN BY CHANCE SHE CAST HER EYES ON A LOOKING GLASS THAT STOOD NEAR HER AND IN IT SHE SAW A PICTURE OF HER OLD HOME AND HER FATHER RIDING MOURNFULLY UP TO THE DOOR HER SISTERS CAME OUT TO MEET HIM
8242-279764-0063 AND ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED TO LOOK SORRY
8242-279764-0064 IN A SHORT TIME ALL THIS PICTURE DISAPPEARED BUT IT CAUSED BEAUTY TO THINK THAT THE BEAST BESIDES BEING VERY POWERFUL WAS ALSO VERY KIND ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY SHE FOUND A TABLE LAID READY FOR HER
8242-279764-0065 AND A SWEET CONCERT OF MUSIC PLAYED ALL THE TIME SHE WAS DINING WITHOUT HER SEEING ANYBODY BUT AT SUPPER WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO SEAT HERSELF AT TABLE SHE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE BEAST AND COULD NOT HELP TREMBLING WITH FEAR
8242-279764-0066 BEAUTY SAID HE WILL YOU GIVE ME LEAVE TO SEE YOU SUP THAT IS AS YOU PLEASE ANSWERED SHE VERY MUCH AFRAID NOT IN THE LEAST SAID THE BEAST YOU ALONE COMMAND IN THIS PLACE
8242-279764-0067 IF YOU SHOULD NOT LIKE MY COMPANY YOU NEED ONLY SAY SO
8242-279764-0068 BUT TELL ME BEAUTY DO YOU NOT THINK ME VERY UGLY WHY YES SAID SHE FOR I CANNOT TELL A FALSEHOOD BUT THEN I THINK YOU ARE VERY GOOD AM I SADLY REPLIED THE BEAST
8242-279764-0069 AT WHICH KINDLY SPEECH THE BEAST LOOKED PLEASED AND REPLIED NOT WITHOUT AN AWKWARD SORT OF POLITENESS PRAY DO NOT LET ME DETAIN YOU FROM SUPPER
8242-279764-0070 AND BE SURE THAT YOU ARE WELL SERVED ALL YOU SEE IS YOUR OWN AND I SHOULD BE DEEPLY GRIEVED IF YOU WANTED FOR ANY THING YOU ARE VERY KIND SO KIND THAT I ALMOST FORGOT YOU ARE SO UGLY
8242-279764-0071 IT IS BETTER OF THE TWO TO HAVE THE HEART OF A MAN AND THE FORM OF A MONSTER I WOULD THANK YOU BEAUTY FOR THIS SPEECH BUT I AM TOO SENSELESS TO SAY ANYTHING THAT WOULD PLEASE YOU RETURNED THE BEAST IN A MELANCHOLY VOICE
8242-279764-0072 HE TERRIFIED HER MORE THAN EVER BY SAYING ABRUPTLY IN HIS GRUFF VOICE BEAUTY WILL YOU MARRY ME NOW BEAUTY FRIGHTENED AS SHE WAS WOULD SPEAK ONLY THE EXACT TRUTH BESIDES HER FATHER HAD TOLD HER THAT THE BEAST LIKED ONLY TO HAVE THE TRUTH SPOKEN TO HIM
8242-279764-0073 OH SAID SHE WHAT A SAD THING IT IS THAT HE SHOULD BE SO VERY FRIGHTFUL SINCE HE IS SO GOOD TEMPERED BEAUTY LIVED THREE MONTHS IN THIS PALACE VERY WELL PLEASED
8242-279764-0074 INSTEAD OF DREADING THE TIME OF HIS COMING SHE SOON BEGAN CONTINUALLY LOOKING AT HER WATCH TO SEE IF IT WERE NINE O'CLOCK
8242-279764-0075 ONE THING ONLY VEXED HER WHICH WAS THAT EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT AWAY HE ALWAYS MADE IT A RULE TO ASK HER IF SHE WOULD BE HIS WIFE
8242-279764-0076 AT LAST ONE NIGHT SHE SAID TO HIM YOU WOUND ME GREATLY BEAST BY FORCING ME TO REFUSE YOU SO OFTEN
8242-279764-0077 BUT I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I DO NOT THINK IT WILL EVER HAPPEN I SHALL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND SO TRY TO LET THAT CONTENT YOU I MUST SIGHED THE BEAST FOR I KNOW WELL ENOUGH HOW FRIGHTFUL I AM
8242-279764-0078 THAT IF YOU DO NOT GIVE ME LEAVE TO VISIT HIM I SHALL BREAK MY HEART I WOULD RATHER BREAK MINE BEAUTY ANSWERED THE BEAST I WILL SEND YOU TO YOUR FATHER'S COTTAGE YOU SHALL STAY THERE AND YOUR POOR BEAST SHALL DIE OF SORROW
8242-279764-0079 NO SAID BEAUTY CRYING I LOVE YOU TOO WELL TO BE THE CAUSE OF YOUR DEATH I PROMISE TO RETURN IN A WEEK YOU HAVE SHOWN ME THAT MY SISTERS ARE MARRIED AND MY BROTHERS ARE GONE FOR SOLDIERS SO THAT MY FATHER IS LEFT ALL ALONE
8242-279764-0080 GOOD BYE BEAUTY THE BEAST SIGHED AS HE SAID THESE WORDS AND BEAUTY WENT TO BED VERY SORRY TO SEE HIM SO MUCH GRIEVED WHEN SHE AWOKE IN THE MORNING SHE FOUND HERSELF IN HER FATHER'S COTTAGE
8242-279764-0081 SHE RANG A BELL THAT WAS AT HER BEDSIDE AND A SERVANT ENTERED BUT AS SOON AS SHE SAW BEAUTY THE WOMAN GAVE A LOUD SHRIEK UPON WHICH THE MERCHANT RAN UPSTAIRS AND WHEN HE BEHELD HIS DAUGHTER HE RAN TO HER AND KISSED HER A HUNDRED TIMES
8242-279764-0082 AT LAST BEAUTY BEGAN TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT NO CLOTHES WITH HER TO PUT ON
8242-279764-0083 TRIMMED ALL OVER WITH GOLD AND ADORNED WITH PEARLS AND DIAMONDS BEAUTY IN HER OWN MIND THANKED THE BEAST FOR HIS KINDNESS AND PUT ON THE PLAINEST GOWN SHE COULD FIND AMONG THEM ALL
8242-279764-0084 SHE THEN DESIRED THE SERVANT TO LAY THE REST ASIDE FOR SHE INTENDED TO GIVE THEM TO HER SISTERS BUT AS SOON AS SHE HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS THE CHEST WAS GONE OUT OF SIGHT IN A MOMENT
8242-279764-0085 HER FATHER THEN SUGGESTED PERHAPS THE BEAST CHOSE FOR HER TO KEEP THEM ALL FOR HERSELF AND AS SOON AS HE HAD SAID THIS
8242-279764-0086 WHILE BEAUTY WAS DRESSING HERSELF A SERVANT BROUGHT WORD TO HER THAT HER SISTERS WERE COME WITH THEIR HUSBANDS TO PAY HER A VISIT THEY BOTH LIVED UNHAPPILY WITH THE GENTLEMEN THEY HAD MARRIED THE HUSBAND OF THE ELDEST WAS VERY HANDSOME
8242-279764-0087 BUT WAS SO PROUD OF THIS THAT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND DID NOT CARE A PIN FOR THE BEAUTY OF HIS WIFE THE SECOND HAD MARRIED A MAN OF GREAT LEARNING BUT HE MADE NO USE OF IT EXCEPT TO TORMENT AND AFFRONT ALL HIS FRIENDS
8242-279764-0088 AND HIS WIFE MORE THAN ANY OF THEM THE TWO SISTERS WERE READY TO BURST WITH SPITE WHEN THEY SAW BEAUTY DRESSED LIKE A PRINCESS AND LOOKING SO VERY CHARMING ALL THE KINDNESS THAT SHE SHOWED THEM WAS OF NO USE
8242-279764-0089 FOR THEY WERE VEXED MORE THAN EVER WHEN SHE TOLD THEM HOW HAPPY SHE LIVED AT THE PALACE OF THE BEAST
8242-279764-0090 THOUGHT OF ANSWERED THE OTHER BUT TO DO THIS WE MUST PRETEND TO BE VERY KIND THEY THEN WENT TO JOIN HER IN THE COTTAGE WHERE THEY SHOWED HER SO MUCH FALSE LOVE THAT BEAUTY COULD NOT HELP CRYING FOR JOY
8242-279764-0091 WHEN THE WEEK WAS ENDED THE TWO SISTERS BEGAN TO PRETEND SUCH GRIEF AT THE THOUGHT OF HER LEAVING THEM THAT SHE AGREED TO STAY A WEEK MORE
8242-279764-0092 AMONG ALL THE GRAND AND CLEVER PEOPLE SHE SAW SHE FOUND NOBODY WHO WAS HALF SO SENSIBLE SO AFFECTIONATE SO THOUGHTFUL OR SO KIND THE TENTH NIGHT OF HER BEING AT THE COTTAGE SHE DREAMED SHE WAS IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALACE
8242-279764-0093 THAT THE BEAST LAY DYING ON A GRASS PLOT AND WITH HIS LAST BREATH PUT HER IN MIND OF HER PROMISE AND LAID HIS DEATH TO HER FORSAKING HIM BEAUTY AWOKE IN A GREAT FRIGHT AND BURST INTO TEARS
8242-279764-0094 I AM SURE I SHOULD BE MORE HAPPY WITH HIM THAN MY SISTERS ARE WITH THEIR HUSBANDS HE SHALL NOT BE WRETCHED ANY LONGER ON MY ACCOUNT FOR I SHOULD DO NOTHING BUT BLAME MYSELF ALL THE REST OF MY LIFE SHE THEN ROSE PUT HER RING ON THE TABLE
8242-279764-0095 GOT INTO BED AGAIN AND SOON FELL ASLEEP IN THE MORNING SHE WITH JOY FOUND HERSELF IN THE PALACE OF THE BEAST SHE DRESSED HERSELF VERY CAREFULLY THAT SHE MIGHT PLEASE HIM THE BETTER AND THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN A DAY PASS AWAY SO SLOWLY
8242-279764-0096 RUSHED TO THE GRASS PLOT AND THERE SAW HIM LYING APPARENTLY DEAD BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN FORGETTING ALL HIS UGLINESS
8242-279764-0097 SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIS BODY AND FINDING HIS HEART STILL BEAT SHE FETCHED SOME WATER AND SPRINKLED IT OVER HIM WEEPING AND SOBBING THE WHILE THE BEAST OPENED HIS EYES YOU FORGOT YOUR PROMISE BEAUTY AND SO I DETERMINED TO DIE
8242-279764-0098 FOR I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU I HAVE STARVED MYSELF TO DEATH BUT I SHALL DIE CONTENT SINCE I HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE ONCE MORE NO DEAR BEAST CRIED BEAUTY PASSIONATELY YOU SHALL NOT DIE YOU SHALL LIVE TO BE MY HUSBAND
8242-279764-0099 I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY FRIENDSHIP I FELT FOR YOU BUT NOW I KNOW IT WAS LOVE THE MOMENT BEAUTY HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS THE PALACE WAS SUDDENLY LIGHTED UP AND ALL KINDS OF REJOICINGS WERE HEARD AROUND THEM NONE WHICH SHE NOTICED
8242-279764-0100 BUT HUNG OVER HER DEAR BEAST WITH THE UTMOST TENDERNESS AT LAST UNABLE TO RESTRAIN HERSELF SHE DROPPED HER HEAD OVER HER HANDS COVERED HER EYES AND CRIED FOR JOY
8242-279764-0101 AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP AGAIN THE BEAST WAS GONE IN HIS STEAD SHE SAW AT HER FEET A HANDSOME GRACEFUL YOUNG PRINCE WHO THANKED HER WITH THE TENDEREST EXPRESSIONS FOR HAVING FREED HIM FROM ENCHANTMENT
8242-279764-0102 YOU ALONE DEAREST BEAUTY JUDGED ME NEITHER BY MY LOOKS NOR BY MY TALENTS BUT BY MY HEART ALONE TAKE IT THEN AND ALL THAT I HAVE BESIDES FOR ALL IS YOURS
8242-279764-0103 BEAUTY FULL OF SURPRISE BUT VERY HAPPY SUFFERED THE PRINCE TO LEAD HER TO HIS PALACE WHERE SHE FOUND HER FATHER AND SISTERS WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE BY THE FAIRY LADY WHOM SHE HAD SEEN IN A DREAM THE FIRST NIGHT SHE CAME
8242-279764-0104 BEAUTY SAID THE FAIRY YOU HAVE CHOSEN WELL AND YOU HAVE YOUR REWARD FOR A TRUE HEART IS BETTER THAN EITHER GOOD LOOKS OR CLEVER BRAINS AS FOR YOU LADIES AND SHE TURNED TO THE TWO ELDER SISTERS
8242-279764-0105 I KNOW ALL YOUR ILL DEEDS BUT I HAVE NO WORSE PUNISHMENT FOR YOU THAN TO SEE YOUR SISTER HAPPY
