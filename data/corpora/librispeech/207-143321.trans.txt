207-143321-0000 WHAT IS IT WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED TOM SPRINGING FROM HIS COT AND HASTENING TO THE SIDE OF HIS CHUM IN THE TENT
207-143321-0001 I DON'T KNOW BUT JACINTO IS YELLING SOMETHING ABOUT VAMPIRES VAMPIRES
207-143321-0002 AND IN THE GLEAM OF IT HE AND NED SAW FLUTTERING ABOUT THE TENT SOME DARK SHADOW LIKE FORM AT THE SIGHT OF WHICH TOM'S CHUM CRIED
207-143321-0003 THAT'S THE SHADOW LOOK OUT AND HE HELD UP HIS HANDS INSTINCTIVELY TO SHIELD HIS FACE SHADOW YELLED TOM UNCONSCIOUSLY ADDING TO THE DIN THAT SEEMED TO PERVADE EVERY PART OF THE CAMP THAT ISN'T A SHADOW IT'S SUBSTANCE IT'S A MONSTER BAT
207-143321-0004 HE CAUGHT UP HIS CAMERA TRIPOD WHICH WAS NEAR HIS COT AND MADE A SWING WITH IT AT THE CREATURE THAT HAD FLOWN INTO THE TENT THROUGH AN OPENING IT HAD MADE FOR ITSELF LOOK OUT YELLED NED IF IT'S A VAMPIRE IT'LL IT WON'T DO ANYTHING TO ME SHOUTED TOM AS HE STRUCK THE CREATURE
207-143321-0005 KNOCKING IT INTO THE CORNER OF THE TENT WITH A THUD THAT TOLD IT MUST BE COMPLETELY STUNNED IF NOT KILLED
207-143321-0006 FROM WITHOUT THE TENT CAME THE INDIAN CRIES OF OSHTOO OSHTOO MINGLED WITH THEM WERE CALLS OF JACINTO PARTLY IN SPANISH PARTLY IN THE INDIAN TONGUE AND PARTLY IN ENGLISH IT IS A RAID BY VAMPIRE BATS WAS ALL TOM AND NED COULD DISTINGUISH
207-143321-0007 WE SHALL HAVE TO LIGHT FIRES TO KEEP THEM AWAY IF WE CAN SUCCEED EVERY ONE GRAB UP A CLUB AND STRIKE HARD COME ON CRIED TOM GETTING ON SOME CLOTHES BY THE LIGHT OF HIS GLEAMING ELECTRIC LIGHT WHICH HE HAD SET ON HIS COT YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE ARE YOU ASKED NED
207-143321-0008 I CERTAINLY AM IF THERE'S A FIGHT
207-143321-0009 HERE YOU HAVE A LIGHT LIKE MINE FLASH IT ON AND HANG IT SOMEWHERE ON YOURSELF THEN GET A CLUB AND COME ON THE LIGHTS WILL BLIND THE BATS AND WE CAN SEE TO HIT EM TOM'S PLAN SEEMED TO BE A GOOD ONE HIS LAMP AND NED'S HAD SMALL HOOKS ON THEM
207-143321-0010 SO THEY COULD BE CARRIED IN THE UPPER COAT POCKET SHOWING A GLEAM OF LIGHT AND LEAVING THE HANDS FREE FOR USE OUT OF THE TENTS RUSHED THE YOUNG MEN TO FIND PROFESSOR BUMPER AND MISTER DAMON BEFORE THEM THE TWO MEN HAD CLUBS AND WERE STRIKING ABOUT IN THE HALF DARKNESS
207-143321-0011 FOR NOW THE INDIANS HAD SET SEVERAL FIRES AGLOW AND IN THE GLEAMS CONSTANTLY GROWING BRIGHTER AS MORE FUEL WAS PILED ON
207-143321-0012 SAW A WEIRD SIGHT CIRCLING AND WHEELING ABOUT IN THE CAMP CLEARING WERE MANY OF THE BLACK SHADOWY FORMS THAT HAD CAUSED NED SUCH ALARM GREAT BATS THEY WERE AND A DANGEROUS SPECIES IF JACINTO WAS TO BE BELIEVED
207-143321-0013 THE UNCANNY CREATURES FLEW IN AND OUT AMONG THE TREES AND TENTS NOW SWOOPING LOW NEAR THE INDIANS OR THE TRAVELERS AT SUCH TIMES CLUBS WOULD BE USED OFTEN WITH THE EFFECT OF KILLING OR STUNNING THE FLYING PESTS
207-143321-0014 FOR A TIME IT SEEMED AS IF THE BATS WOULD FAIRLY OVERWHELM THE CAMP SO MANY OF THEM WERE THERE BUT THE INCREASING LIGHTS AND THE ATTACKS MADE BY THE INDIANS AND THE WHITE TRAVELERS TURNED THE TIDE OF BATTLE AND WITH SILENT FLAPPINGS OF THEIR SOFT VELVETY WINGS
207-143321-0015 THE BATS FLEW BACK TO THE JUNGLE WHENCE THEY HAD EMERGED WE ARE SAFE FOR THE PRESENT EXCLAIMED JACINTO WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
207-143321-0016 THEY MAY THERE IS NO TELLING BLESS MY SPEEDOMETER CRIED MISTER DAMON IF THOSE BEASTS OR BIRDS WHATEVER THEY ARE COME BACK I'LL GO AND HIDE IN THE RIVER AND TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE ALLIGATORS
207-143321-0017 CAN KILL A HORSE OR AN OX IN A SHORT TIME BY SUCKING ITS BLOOD SO WHEN THE VILLAGERS FIND THEY ARE VISITED BY A COLONY OF THESE VAMPIRES THEY GET OUT TAKING THEIR LIVE STOCK WITH THEM AND STAY IN CAVES OR IN DENSELY WOODED PLACES UNTIL THE BATS FLY ON
207-143321-0018 I DO NOT THINK THIS LOT WILL COME BACK WE HAVE KILLED TOO MANY OF THEM
207-143321-0019 COME BACK AGAIN CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SKIN I HOPE NOT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BATS AND MOSQUITOES HE ADDED AS HE SLAPPED AT HIS FACE AND NECK INDEED THE PARTY OF WHITES WERE SET UPON BY THE NIGHT INSECTS TO SUCH AN EXTENT
207-143321-0020 TOM AND NED KICKED OUTSIDE THE BAT THE FORMER HAD KILLED IN THEIR TENT AND THEN BOTH WENT BACK TO THEIR COTS BUT IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE THEY FELL ASLEEP AND THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TIME TO REST
207-143321-0021 AS HE AND TOM AROSE IN THE GRAY DAWN OF THE MORNING WHEN JACINTO ANNOUNCED THE BREAKFAST WHICH THE INDIAN COOK HAD PREPARED THAT WAS SOME NIGHT IF THIS IS A SAMPLE OF THE WILDS OF HONDURAS GIVE ME THE TAMENESS OF SHOPTON
207-143321-0022 OH WE'VE GONE THROUGH WITH WORSE THAN THIS LAUGHED TOM IT'S ALL IN THE DAY'S WORK WE'VE ONLY GOT STARTED
207-143321-0023 THOUGH WE HAD HARD ENOUGH WORK IN THAT TUNNEL DIGGING AFTER BREAKFAST WHILE THE INDIANS WERE MAKING READY THE CANOES PROFESSOR BUMPER WHO IN A PREVIOUS VISIT TO CENTRAL AMERICA HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT MADE A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF SOME OF THE DEAD BATS
207-143321-0024 THEY WERE EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE SOME ALMOST AS BIG AS HAWKS AND WERE OF THE SUB FAMILY DESMODIDAE THE SCIENTIST SAID THIS IS A TRUE BLOOD SUCKING BAT WENT ON THE PROFESSOR THIS AND HE POINTED TO THE NOSE LEAVES IS THE SUCKING APPARATUS
207-143321-0025 THE BAT MAKES AN OPENING IN THE SKIN WITH ITS SHARP TEETH AND PROCEEDS TO EXTRACT THE BLOOD I CAN WELL BELIEVE TWO OR THREE OF THEM ATTACKING A STEER OR MULE AT ONCE COULD SOON WEAKEN IT SO THE ANIMAL WOULD DIE AND A MAN TOO ASKED NED
207-143321-0026 BUT A HELPLESS QUADRUPED HAS NOT THOUGH IF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE BATS ATTACKED A MAN AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD HAVE SMALL CHANCE TO ESCAPE ALIVE THEIR BITES TOO MAY BE POISONOUS FOR ALL I KNOW
207-143321-0027 THE INDIANS SEEMED GLAD TO LEAVE THE PLACE OF THE BATS AS THEY CALLED THE CAMP SITE JACINTO EXPLAINED THAT THE INDIANS BELIEVED A VAMPIRE COULD KILL THEM WHILE THEY SLEPT AND THEY WERE VERY MUCH AFRAID OF THE BLOOD SUCKING BATS
207-143321-0028 MOST OF WHICH LIVED ON FRUIT OR ON INSECTS THEY CAUGHT THE BLOOD SUCKING BATS WERE COMPARATIVELY FEW AND THE MIGRATORY SORT FEWER STILL WELL WE'RE ON OUR WAY ONCE MORE REMARKED TOM AS AGAIN THEY WERE IN THE CANOES BEING PADDLED UP THE RIVER
207-143321-0029 FROM THEN ON WE TRAVEL BY LAND UNTIL WELL UNTIL YOU GET TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE GOING I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS HE ADDED NODDING TOWARD THE PROFESSOR I AM LEAVING THAT PART TO YOU OH I HAVE A MAP SHOWING WHERE I WANT TO BEGIN SOME EXCAVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER
207-143321-0030 AFTER THAT WELL WE SHALL TRUST TO LUCK FOR WHAT WE SHALL FIND THERE ARE SAID TO BE MANY CURIOUS THINGS WENT ON JACINTO SPEAKING AS THOUGH HE HAD NO INTEREST
207-143321-0031 HAVE YOU THOUGHT WHAT MAY BE IN THEM GREAT HEATHEN TEMPLES IDOLS PERHAPS FOR A MOMENT NONE OF THE PROFESSOR'S COMPANIONS SPOKE
207-143321-0032 FINALLY THE SCIENTIST SAID OH YES WE MAY FIND AN IDOL I UNDERSTAND THE ANCIENT PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE LONG BEFORE THE SPANIARDS CAME WORSHIPED IDOLS BUT WE SHALL TAKE WHATEVER ANTIQUITIES WE FIND HUH GRUNTED JACINTO
207-143321-0033 AND THEN HE CALLED TO THE PADDLERS TO INCREASE THEIR STROKES THE JOURNEY UP THE RIVER WAS NOT VERY EVENTFUL MANY ALLIGATORS WERE SEEN AND TOM AND NED SHOT SEVERAL WITH THE ELECTRIC RIFLE TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD DAY'S TRAVEL THERE WAS A CRY FROM ONE OF THE REAR BOATS
207-143321-0034 I SEE OBSERVED TOM CALMLY HAND ME THE RIFLE NED TOM TOOK QUICK AIM AND PULLED THE TRIGGER THE EXPLOSIVE ELECTRIC BULLET WENT TRUE TO ITS MARK AND THE GREAT ANIMAL TURNED OVER IN A DEATH STRUGGLE
207-143321-0035 THE WATERS SEETHED AND BUBBLED AS THE ALLIGATORS FOUGHT UNDER IT FOR POSSESSION OF THE PADDLER TOM FIRED BULLET AFTER BULLET FROM HIS WONDERFUL RIFLE INTO THE SPOT BUT THOUGH HE KILLED SOME OF THE ALLIGATORS THIS DID NOT SAVE THE MAN'S LIFE HIS BODY WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN
207-143321-0036 THOUGH SEARCH WAS MADE FOR IT THE ACCIDENT CAST A LITTLE DAMPER OVER THE PARTY
207-143321-0037 PROFESSOR BUMPER ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD SEE TO IT THAT THE MAN'S FAMILY DID NOT WANT AND THIS SEEMED TO GIVE GENERAL SATISFACTION ESPECIALLY TO A BROTHER WHO WAS WITH THE PARTY ASIDE FROM BEING CAUGHT IN A DRENCHING STORM AND ONE OR TWO MINOR ACCIDENTS
207-143321-0038 NOTHING ELSE OF MOMENT MARKED THE REMAINDER OF THE RIVER JOURNEY AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD DAY THE CANOES PULLED TO SHORE AND A NIGHT CAMP WAS MADE BUT WHERE ARE THE MULES WE ARE TO USE IN TRAVELING TO MORROW ASKED THE PROFESSOR OF JACINTO IN THE NEXT VILLAGE
207-143321-0039 WE SHALL MARCH THERE IN THE MORNING NO USE TO GO THERE AT NIGHT WHEN ALL IS DARK I SUPPOSE THAT IS SO THE INDIANS MADE CAMP AS USUAL THE GOODS BEING BROUGHT FROM THE CANOES AND PILED UP NEAR THE TENTS THEN NIGHT SETTLED DOWN
207-143321-0040 WE MUST HAVE OVERSLEPT NED WE WERE TO START BEFORE OLD SOL GOT IN HIS HEAVY WORK BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET I DIDN'T HEAR ANY ONE CALL US REMARKED NED NOR I WONDER IF WE'RE THE ONLY LAZY BIRDS
207-143321-0041 THEN TOM NOTICED SOMETHING QUEER THE CANOES WERE NOT ON THE RIVER BANK THERE WAS NOT AN INDIAN IN SIGHT AND NO EVIDENCE OF JACINTO WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAVE THE OTHERS GONE ON AHEAD
207-143321-0042 I RATHER THINK THEY'VE GONE BACK WAS THE PROFESSOR'S DRY COMMENT GONE BACK YES THE INDIANS SEEM TO HAVE DESERTED US AT THE ENDING OF THIS STAGE OF OUR JOURNEY BLESS MY TIME TABLE CRIED MISTER DAMON YOU DON'T SAY SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN
207-143321-0043 I'M AFRAID HE WAS RATHER A FALSE FRIEND WAS THE PROFESSOR'S ANSWER
