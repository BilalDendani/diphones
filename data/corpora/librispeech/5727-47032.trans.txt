5727-47032-0000 SILKWORMS I WAS PUZZLED BY THE PHRASE SILKWORM MOTH EYEBROW IN AN OLD JAPANESE OR RATHER CHINESE PROVERB
5727-47032-0001 THAT YOU NEVER SAW A SILKWORM MOTH THE SILKWORM MOTH HAS VERY BEAUTIFUL EYEBROWS EYEBROWS I QUERIED IN ASTONISHMENT WELL CALL THEM WHAT YOU LIKE RETURNED NIIMI THE POETS CALL THEM EYEBROWS
5727-47032-0002 HE LEFT THE GUEST ROOM AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH A WHITE PAPER FAN ON WHICH A SILKWORM MOTH WAS SLEEPILY REPOSING WE ALWAYS RESERVE A FEW FOR BREEDING HE SAID THIS ONE IS JUST OUT OF THE COCOON
5727-47032-0003 IT CANNOT FLY OF COURSE NONE OF THEM CAN FLY NOW LOOK AT THE EYEBROWS I LOOKED AND SAW THAT THE ANTENNAE VERY SHORT AND FEATHERY WERE SO ARCHED BACK OVER THE TWO JEWEL SPECKS OF EYES IN THE VELVETY HEAD
5727-47032-0004 AS TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF A REALLY HANDSOME PAIR OF EYE BROWS THEN NIIMI TOOK ME TO SEE HIS WORMS IN NIIMI'S NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF MULBERRYTREES MANY FAMILIES KEEP SILKWORMS
5727-47032-0005 AND TO HEAR THE SOFT PAPERY NOISE WHICH THEY MAKE WHILE GNAWING THEIR MULBERRY LEAVES AS THEY APPROACH MATURITY THE CREATURES NEED ALMOST CONSTANT ATTENTION AT BRIEF INTERVALS SOME EXPERT VISITS EACH TRAY TO INSPECT PROGRESS
5727-47032-0006 A FEW ONLY OF THE BEST ARE SUFFERED TO EMERGE FROM THEIR SILKY SLEEP THE SELECTED BREEDERS THEY HAVE BEAUTIFUL WINGS BUT CANNOT USE THEM THEY HAVE MOUTHS BUT DO NOT EAT THEY ONLY PAIR
5727-47032-0007 LAY EGGS AND DIE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THEIR RACE HAS BEEN SO WELL CARED FOR THAT IT CAN NO LONGER TAKE ANY CARE OF ITSELF IT WAS THE EVOLUTIONAL LESSON OF THIS LATTER FACT THAT CHIEFLY OCCUPIED ME
5727-47032-0008 WHILE NIIMI AND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WHO FEEDS THE WORMS WERE KINDLY EXPLAINING THE METHODS OF THE INDUSTRY THEY TOLD ME CURIOUS THINGS ABOUT DIFFERENT BREEDS AND ALSO ABOUT A WILD VARIETY OF SILKWORM THAT CANNOT BE DOMESTICATED
5727-47032-0009 IT SPINS SPLENDID SILK BEFORE TURNING INTO A VIGOROUS MOTH WHICH CAN USE ITS WINGS TO SOME PURPOSE BUT I FEAR THAT I DID NOT ACT LIKE A PERSON WHO FELT INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT FOR EVEN WHILE I TRIED TO LISTEN I BEGAN TO MUSE
5727-47032-0010 TWO FIRST OF ALL I FOUND MYSELF THINKING ABOUT A DELIGHTFUL REVERY BY M ANATOLE FRANCE IN WHICH HE SAYS THAT IF HE HAD BEEN THE DEMIURGE
5727-47032-0011 HE WOULD HAVE PUT YOUTH AT THE END OF LIFE INSTEAD OF AT THE BEGINNING AND WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE SO ORDERED MATTERS THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING SHOULD HAVE THREE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT SOMEWHAT CORRESPONDING TO THOSE OF THE LEPIDOPTERA
5727-47032-0012 THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS FANTASY WAS IN SUBSTANCE SCARCELY MORE THAN THE DELICATE MODIFICATION OF A MOST ANCIENT DOCTRINE COMMON TO NEARLY ALL THE HIGHER FORMS OF RELIGION
5727-47032-0013 WESTERN FAITHS ESPECIALLY TEACH THAT OUR LIFE ON EARTH IS A LARVAL STATE OF GREEDY HELPLESSNESS AND THAT DEATH IS A PUPA SLEEP OUT OF WHICH WE SHOULD SOAR INTO EVERLASTING LIGHT THEY TELL US THAT DURING ITS SENTIENT EXISTENCE
5727-47032-0014 THE OUTER BODY SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ONLY AS A KIND OF CATERPILLAR AND THEREAFTER AS A CHRYSALIS AND THEY AVER THAT WE LOSE OR GAIN ACCORDING TO OUR BEHAVIOR AS LARVAE THE POWER TO DEVELOP WINGS UNDER THE MORTAL WRAPPING
5727-47032-0015 ALSO THEY TELL US NOT TO TROUBLE OURSELVES ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE SEE NO PSYCHE IMAGO DETACH ITSELF FROM THE BROKEN COCOON THIS LACK OF VISUAL EVIDENCE SIGNIFIES NOTHING BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY THE PURBLIND VISION OF GRUBS
5727-47032-0016 OUR EYES ARE BUT HALF EVOLVED DO NOT WHOLE SCALES OF COLORS INVISIBLY EXIST ABOVE AND BELOW THE LIMITS OF OUR RETINAL SENSIBILITY EVEN SO THE BUTTERFLY MAN EXISTS ALTHOUGH AS A MATTER OF COURSE WE CANNOT SEE HIM
5727-47032-0017 BUT WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THIS HUMAN IMAGO IN A STATE OF PERFECT BLISS FROM THE EVOLUTIONAL POINT OF VIEW THE QUESTION HAS INTEREST AND ITS OBVIOUS ANSWER WAS SUGGESTED TO ME BY THE HISTORY OF THOSE SILKWORMS WHICH HAVE BEEN DOMESTICATED FOR ONLY A FEW THOUSAND YEARS
5727-47032-0018 CONSIDER THE RESULT OF OUR CELESTIAL DOMESTICATION FOR LET US SAY SEVERAL MILLIONS OF YEARS I MEAN THE FINAL CONSEQUENCE TO THE WISHERS OF BEING ABLE TO GRATIFY EVERY WISH AT WILL THOSE SILKWORMS HAVE ALL THAT THEY WISH FOR
5727-47032-0019 EVEN CONSIDERABLY MORE THEIR WANTS THOUGH VERY SIMPLE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY IDENTICAL WITH THE NECESSITIES OF MANKIND FOOD SHELTER WARMTH SAFETY AND COMFORT OUR ENDLESS SOCIAL STRUGGLE IS MAINLY FOR THESE THINGS
5727-47032-0020 I AM NOT CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT A VAST MAJORITY OF THE WORMS ARE PREDESTINED TO TORMENT AND THE SECOND DEATH FOR MY THEME IS OF HEAVEN NOT OF LOST SOULS I AM SPEAKING OF THE ELECT THOSE WORMS PREORDAINED TO SALVATION AND REBIRTH
5727-47032-0021 PROBABLY THEY CAN FEEL ONLY VERY WEAK SENSATIONS THEY ARE CERTAINLY INCAPABLE OF PRAYER BUT IF THEY WERE ABLE TO PRAY THEY COULD NOT ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN THEY ALREADY RECEIVE FROM THE YOUTH WHO FEEDS AND TENDS THEM
5727-47032-0022 HE IS THEIR PROVIDENCE A GOD OF WHOSE EXISTENCE THEY CAN BE AWARE IN ONLY THE VAGUEST POSSIBLE WAY BUT JUST SUCH A GOD AS THEY REQUIRE
5727-47032-0023 TO BE EQUALLY WELL CARED FOR IN PROPORTION TO OUR MORE COMPLEX WANTS DO NOT OUR COMMON FORMS OF PRAYER PROVE OUR DESIRE FOR LIKE ATTENTION IS NOT THE ASSERTION OF OUR NEED OF DIVINE LOVE
5727-47032-0024 AN INVOLUNTARY CONFESSION THAT WE WISH TO BE TREATED LIKE SILKWORMS TO LIVE WITHOUT PAIN BY THE HELP OF GODS YET IF THE GODS WERE TO TREAT US AS WE WANT WE SHOULD PRESENTLY AFFORD FRESH EVIDENCE
5727-47032-0025 IN THE WAY OF WHAT IS CALLED THE EVIDENCE FROM DEGENERATION THAT THE GREAT EVOLUTIONAL LAW IS FAR ABOVE THE GODS AN EARLY STAGE OF THAT DEGENERATION WOULD BE REPRESENTED BY TOTAL INCAPACITY TO HELP OURSELVES
5727-47032-0026 THEN WE SHOULD BEGIN TO LOSE THE USE OF OUR HIGHER SENSE ORGANS LATER ON THE BRAIN WOULD SHRINK TO A VANISHING PIN POINT OF MATTER STILL LATER WE SHOULD DWINDLE INTO MERE AMORPHOUS SACS MERE BLIND STOMACHS
5727-47032-0027 THE LONGING FOR PERPETUAL BLISS IN PERPETUAL PEACE MIGHT WELL SEEM A MALEVOLENT INSPIRATION FROM THE LORDS OF DEATH AND DARKNESS ALL LIFE THAT FEELS AND THINKS HAS BEEN AND CAN CONTINUE TO BE ONLY AS THE PRODUCT OF STRUGGLE AND PAIN
5727-47032-0028 AND COSMIC LAW IS UNCOMPROMISING WHATEVER ORGAN CEASES TO KNOW PAIN WHATEVER FACULTY CEASES TO BE USED UNDER THE STIMULUS OF PAIN MUST ALSO CEASE TO EXIST
5727-47032-0029 FIRST INTO PROTOPLASMIC SHAPELESSNESS THEREAFTER INTO DUST BUDDHISM WHICH IN ITS OWN GRAND WAY IS A DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION RATIONALLY PROCLAIMS ITS HEAVEN BUT A HIGHER STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THROUGH PAIN
5727-47032-0030 THERE IS LITTLE FAULT TO BE FOUND WITH THIS TEACHING FROM A SCIENTIFIC STANDPOINT SINCE WE KNOW THAT HIGHER EVOLUTION MUST INVOLVE AN INCREASE OF SENSITIVITY TO PAIN IN THE HEAVENS OF DESIRE SAYS THE SHOBO NEN JO KYO
5727-47032-0031 THE PAIN OF DEATH IS SO GREAT THAT ALL THE AGONIES OF ALL THE HELLS UNITED COULD EQUAL BUT ONE SIXTEENTH PART OF SUCH PAIN
5727-47032-0032 FOREGOING COMPARISON IS UNNECESSARILY STRONG BUT THE BUDDHIST TEACHING ABOUT HEAVEN IS IN SUBSTANCE EMINENTLY LOGICAL THE SUPPRESSION OF PAIN MENTAL OR PHYSICAL IN ANY CONCEIVABLE STATE OF SENTIENT EXISTENCE
5727-47032-0033 WOULD NECESSARILY INVOLVE THE SUPPRESSION ALSO OF PLEASURE AND CERTAINLY ALL PROGRESS
5727-47032-0034 HE USED TO BE A GREAT READER OF BUDDHIST BOOKS WELL HE SAID I WAS REMINDED OF A QUEER BUDDHIST STORY BY THE PROVERB THAT YOU ASKED ME TO EXPLAIN THE SILKWORM MOTH EYEBROW OF A WOMAN IS THE AXE THAT CUTS DOWN THE WISDOM OF MAN
5727-47032-0035 ACCORDING TO OUR DOCTRINE
5727-47032-0036 THIS IS THE STORY WHEN SHAKA
5727-47032-0037 ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES CALLED NANDA WAS BEWITCHED BY THE BEAUTY OF A WOMAN AND SHAKA DESIRED TO SAVE HIM FROM THE RESULTS OF THIS ILLUSION
5727-47032-0038 AND SHOWED HIM A VERY UGLY FEMALE APE AND ASKED HIM
5727-47032-0039 THE WOMAN THAT YOU LOVE OR THIS FEMALE APE OH MASTER EXCLAIMED NANDA HOW CAN A LOVELY WOMAN BE COMPARED WITH AN UGLY APE PERHAPS YOU WILL PRESENTLY FIND REASON TO MAKE THE COMPARISON YOURSELF ANSWERED THE BUDDHA
5727-47032-0040 AND INSTANTLY BY SUPERNATURAL POWER HE ASCENDED WITH NANDA TO THE SAN JUSAN TEN WHICH IS THE SECOND OF THE SIX HEAVENS OF DESIRE THERE WITHIN A PALACE OF JEWELS
5727-47032-0041 NANDA SAW A MULTITUDE OF HEAVENLY MAIDENS CELEBRATING SOME FESTIVAL WITH MUSIC AND DANCE AND THE BEAUTY OF THE LEAST AMONG THEM INCOMPARABLY EXCEEDED THAT OF THE FAIREST WOMAN OF EARTH O MASTER CRIED NANDA WHAT WONDERFUL FESTIVAL IS THIS
5727-47032-0042 ASK SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE RESPONDED SHAKA SO NANDA QUESTIONED ONE OF THE CELESTIAL MAIDENS AND SHE SAID TO HIM THIS FESTIVAL IS TO CELEBRATE THE GOOD TIDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO US THERE IS NOW IN THE HUMAN WORLD AMONG THE DISCIPLES OF SHAKA
5727-47032-0043 A MOST EXCELLENT YOUTH CALLED NANDA WHO IS SOON TO BE REBORN INTO THIS HEAVEN AND TO BECOME OUR BRIDEGROOM BECAUSE OF HIS HOLY LIFE WE WAIT FOR HIM WITH REJOICING THIS REPLY FILLED THE HEART OF NANDA WITH DELIGHT
5727-47032-0044 THEN THE BUDDHA ASKED HIM IS THERE ANY ONE AMONG THESE MAIDENS NANDA EQUAL IN BEAUTY TO THE WOMAN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE BEEN IN LOVE NAY MASTER ANSWERED NANDA EVEN AS THAT WOMAN SURPASSED IN BEAUTY THE FEMALE APE THAT WE SAW ON THE MOUNTAIN
5727-47032-0045 THEN NANDA FOUND HIMSELF STANDING BEFORE A HUGE VESSEL WHICH WAS FILLED WITH MOLTEN METAL AND HE FEARED AND WONDERED BECAUSE THIS VESSEL HAD AS YET NO OCCUPANT AN IDLE DEVIL SAT BESIDE IT YAWNING
5727-47032-0046 ON ACCOUNT OF HIS FORMER GOOD ACTIONS BUT AFTER HAVING THERE INDULGED HIMSELF HE IS TO BE REBORN IN THIS HELL AND HIS PLACE WILL BE IN THAT POT I AM WAITING FOR HIM
5727-47032-0047 BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMPARE IT WITH ANY PUBLISHED TEXT
5727-47032-0048 THERE IS A PALI VERSION OF THE LEGEND WHICH DIFFERS CONSIDERABLY FROM THE ABOVE
