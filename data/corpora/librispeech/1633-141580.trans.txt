1633-141580-0000 RAGGEDY ANN AND THE WASHING WHY DINAH HOW COULD YOU MAMMA LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAW MARCELLA RUN UP TO DINAH AND TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HER HAND AND THEN PUT HER HEAD IN HER ARM AND COMMENCE CRYING
1633-141580-0001 WHAT IS THE TROUBLE DEAR MAMMA ASKED AS SHE CAME OUT THE DOOR AND KNELT BESIDE THE LITTLE FIGURE SHAKING WITH SOBS MARCELLA HELD OUT RAGGEDY ANN BUT SUCH A COMICAL LOOKING RAGGEDY ANN
1633-141580-0002 MAMMA HAD TO SMILE IN SPITE OF HER SYMPATHY FOR RAGGEDY ANN LOOKED RIDICULOUS DINAH'S BIG EYES ROLLED OUT IN A TROUBLED MANNER FOR MARCELLA HAD SNATCHED RAGGEDY ANN FROM DINAH'S HAND AS SHE CRIED WHY DINAH HOW COULD YOU
1633-141580-0003 DINAH COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND AND AS SHE DEARLY LOVED MARCELLA SHE WAS TROUBLED RAGGEDY ANN WAS NOT IN THE LEAST DOWNHEARTED AND WHILE SHE FELT SHE MUST LOOK VERY FUNNY
1633-141580-0004 SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE BUT WITH A MORE EXPANSIVE SMILE THAN EVER BEFORE RAGGEDY ANN KNEW JUST HOW IT ALL HAPPENED AND HER REMAINING SHOE BUTTON EYE TWINKLED
1633-141580-0005 SHE REMEMBERED THAT MORNING WHEN MARCELLA CAME TO THE NURSERY TO TAKE THE NIGHTIES FROM THE DOLLS AND DRESS THEM SHE HAD BEEN CROSS
1633-141580-0006 PERHAPS SHE HAD CLIMBED OUT OF BED BACKWARDS FOR MARCELLA COMPLAINED TO EACH DOLL AS SHE DRESSED THEM AND WHEN IT CAME RAGGEDY'S TIME TO BE DRESSED
1633-141580-0007 NOW IT HAPPENED RAGGEDY LIT IN THE CLOTHES HAMPER AND THERE SHE LAY ALL DOUBLED UP IN A KNOT A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS DINAH CAME THROUGH THE HALL WITH AN ARMFUL OF CLOTHES AND PILED THEM IN THE HAMPER ON TOP OF RAGGEDY ANN
1633-141580-0008 THEN DINAH CARRIED THE HAMPER OUT IN BACK OF THE HOUSE WHERE SHE DID THE WASHING DINAH DUMPED ALL THE CLOTHES INTO THE BOILER AND POURED WATER ON THEM THE BOILER WAS THEN PLACED UPON THE STOVE
1633-141580-0009 WHEN THE WATER BEGAN TO GET WARM RAGGEDY ANN WIGGLED AROUND AND CLIMBED UP AMONGST THE CLOTHES TO THE TOP OF THE BOILER TO PEEK OUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH STEAM AND SHE COULD SEE NOTHING FOR THAT MATTER
1633-141580-0010 DINAH COULD NOT SEE RAGGEDY ANN EITHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE STEAM SO DINAH USING AN OLD BROOM HANDLE STIRRED THE CLOTHES IN THE BOILER AND THE CLOTHES AND RAGGEDY ANN WERE STIRRED AND WHIRLED AROUND UNTIL ALL WERE THOROUGHLY BOILED
1633-141580-0011 WHEN DINAH TOOK THE CLOTHES A PIECE AT A TIME FROM THE BOILER AND SCRUBBED THEM SHE FINALLY CAME UPON RAGGEDY ANN NOW DINAH DID NOT KNOW BUT THAT MARCELLA HAD PLACED RAGGEDY IN THE CLOTHES HAMPER TO BE WASHED
1633-141580-0012 IT WAS HARD WORK GETTING RAGGEDY THROUGH THE WRINGER BUT DINAH WAS VERY STRONG AND OF COURSE IT HAPPENED
1633-141580-0013 IT WAS JUST THEN THAT MARCELLA RETURNED AND SAW RAGGEDY WHY DINAH HOW COULD YOU MARCELLA HAD SOBBED AS SHE SNATCHED THE FLATTENED RAGGEDY ANN FROM THE BEWILDERED DINAH'S HAND
1633-141580-0014 MAMMA PATTED MARCELLA'S HAND AND SOON COAXED HER TO QUIT SOBBING WHEN DINAH EXPLAINED THAT THE FIRST SHE KNEW OF RAGGEDY BEING IN THE WASH WAS WHEN SHE TOOK HER FROM THE BOILER MARCELLA BEGAN CRYING AGAIN
1633-141580-0015 IT WAS ALL MY FAULT MAMMA SHE CRIED I REMEMBER NOW THAT I THREW DEAR OLD RAGGEDY ANN FROM ME AS I RAN OUT THE DOOR AND SHE MUST HAVE FALLEN IN THE CLOTHES HAMPER OH DEAR OH DEAR AND SHE HUGGED RAGGEDY ANN TIGHT
1633-141580-0016 FOR RAGGEDY ANN'S SMILE WAS ALMOST TWICE AS BROAD AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE JUST LET ME HANG MISS RAGGEDY ON THE LINE IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE FOR HALF AN HOUR SAID DINAH AND YOU WON'T KNOW HER WHEN SHE COMES OFF SO RAGGEDY ANN WAS PINNED TO THE CLOTHES LINE
1633-141580-0017 THEN SHE TOOK RAGGEDY ANN INTO THE HOUSE AND SHOWED MARCELLA AND MAMMA HOW CLEAN AND SWEET SHE WAS
1633-141580-0018 MARCELLA TOOK RAGGEDY ANN RIGHT UP TO THE NURSERY AND TOLD ALL THE DOLLS JUST WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HOW SORRY SHE WAS THAT SHE HAD BEEN SO CROSS AND PEEVISH WHEN SHE DRESSED THEM AND WHILE THE DOLLS SAID NEVER A WORD
1633-141580-0019 THEY LOOKED AT THEIR LITTLE MISTRESS WITH LOVE IN THEIR EYES AS SHE SAT IN THE LITTLE RED ROCKING CHAIR AND HELD RAGGEDY ANN TIGHTLY IN HER ARMS
1633-141580-0020 BUT UPON HER FACE WAS THE SAME OLD SMILE OF HAPPINESS GOOD HUMOR
