8346-244446-0000 WE HAVE TURNED OURSELVES INTO THE BESIEGED AND WHILE I'M EXPECTING EVERYTHING TO TURN OUT FOR THE BEST SAID LANGDON I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE MADE ANYTHING AT ALL BY THE EXCHANGE WE'RE IN THE FORT BUT THE MECHANICS AND MILL HANDS
8346-244446-0001 ARE ON THE SLOPE IN A GOOD POSITION TO PEPPER US OR TO WAIT FOR REINFORCEMENTS SAID HARRY
8346-244446-0002 SAID SAINT CLAIR THEY MAY SEND UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND BRING FOUR OR FIVE TIMES OUR NUMBERS PATTERSON'S ARMY MUST BE SOMEWHERE NEAR BUT WE'LL HOPE THAT THEY WON'T SAID LANGDON
8346-244446-0003 THE NORTHERN TROOPS CEASED THEIR FIRE PRESENTLY BUT THE OFFICERS EXAMINING THE WOODS WITH THEIR GLASSES SAID THEY WERE STILL THERE THEN CAME THE GRIM TASK OF BURYING THE DEAD WHICH WAS DONE INSIDE THE EARTHWORKS
8346-244446-0004 NEARLY TWO SCORE OF THE INVINCIBLES HAD FALLEN TO RISE NO MORE AND ABOUT A HUNDRED WERE WOUNDED IT WAS NO SMALL LOSS EVEN FOR A VETERAN FORCE AND COLONEL TALBOT AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAINT HILAIRE LOOKED GRAVE
8346-244446-0005 MANY OF THE RECRUITS HAD TURNED WHITE AND THEY HAD STRANGE SINKING SENSATIONS THERE WAS LITTLE LAUGHTER OR DISPLAY OF TRIUMPH INSIDE THE EARTHWORKS NOR WAS THERE ANY INCREASE OF CHEER WHEN THE RECRUITS SAW THE SENIOR OFFICERS
8346-244446-0006 DRAW ASIDE AND ENGAGE IN ANXIOUS TALK I'M THINKING THAT IDEA OF YOURS HARRY ABOUT YANKEE REINFORCEMENTS MUST HAVE OCCURRED TO COLONEL TALBOT ALSO SAID LANGDON IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO FEAR
8346-244446-0007 THE YANKEES THAT WE DROVE OUT ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO COME BACK AND DRIVE US OUT SO THEY MUST BE LOOKING FOR A HEAVY FORCE FROM PATTERSON'S ARMY THE CONFERENCE OF THE OFFICERS WAS QUICKLY OVER AND THEN THE MEN WERE PUT TO WORK BUILDING HIGHER THE WALLS OF EARTH
8346-244446-0008 AND DEEPENING THE DITCHES MANY PICKS AND SPADES HAD BEEN CAPTURED IN THE FORT AND OTHERS USED BAYONETS ALL
8346-244446-0009 OR THREE HOURS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION IT WAS NOW NOON AND FOOD WAS SERVED AN ABUNDANCE OF WATER IN BARRELS HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE FORT AND THE MEN DRANK IT EAGERLY AS THE SUN WAS WARM AND THE WORK WITH SPADE AND SHOVEL MADE THEM VERY THIRSTY
8346-244446-0010 THE THREE BOYS DESPITE THEIR RANK HAD BEEN TAKING TURNS WITH THE MEN AND THEY LEANED WEARILY AGAINST THE EARTHWORK THE CLATTER OF TOOLS HAD CEASED THE MEN ATE AND DRANK IN SILENCE NO SOUND CAME FROM THE NORTHERN TROOPS IN THE WOOD
8346-244446-0011 A HEAVY OMINOUS SILENCE BROODED OVER THE LITTLE VALLEY WHICH HAD SEEN SO MUCH BATTLE AND PASSION HARRY FELT RELAXED AND FOR THE MOMENT NERVELESS HIS EYES WANDERED TO THE NEW EARTH BENEATH WHICH THE DEAD LAY
8346-244446-0012 AND HE SHIVERED THE WOUNDED WERE LYING PATIENTLY ON THEIR BLANKETS AND THOSE OF THEIR COMRADES AND THEY DID NOT COMPLAIN THE SURGEONS HAD DONE THEIR BEST FOR THEM AND THE MORE SKILLFUL AMONG THE SOLDIERS HAD HELPED
8346-244446-0013 THE SILENCE WAS VERY HEAVY UPON HARRY'S NERVES OVERHEAD GREAT BIRDS HOVERED ON BLACK WINGS AND WHEN HE SAW THEM HE SHUDDERED SAINT CLAIR SAW THEM TOO NO PLEASANT SIGHT HE SAID
8346-244446-0014 I'M THINKING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BESIEGED IN THIS FORT AND WE'RE NOT OVERBURDENED WITH SUPPLIES I WONDER WHAT THE COLONEL WILL DO HE'LL TRY TO HOLD IT SAID LANGDON HE WAS SENT HERE FOR THAT PURPOSE AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE COLONEL IS HE WILL CERTAINLY STAY SAID HARRY
8346-244446-0015 THROWING THE EARTHWORKS HIGHER AND EVER HIGHER IT WAS CLEAR TO THE THREE LADS THAT COLONEL TALBOT EXPECTED A HEAVY ATTACK PERHAPS WE HAVE UNDERRATED OUR MILL HANDS AND MECHANICS SAID SAINT CLAIR IN HIS PRECISE DANDYISH WAY
8346-244446-0016 THEY MAY NOT RIDE AS WELL OR SHOOT AS WELL AS WE DO BUT THEY SEEM TO BE IN NO HURRY ABOUT GOING BACK TO THEIR FACTORIES HARRY GLANCED AT HIM SAINT CLAIR WAS ALWAYS EXTREMELY PARTICULAR
8346-244446-0017 ABOUT HIS DRESS IT WAS A MATTER TO WHICH HE GAVE TIME AND THOUGHT FREELY NOW DESPITE ALL HIS DIGGING HE WAS AGAIN TRIM IMMACULATE AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF PERSPIRATION
8346-244446-0018 HE WOULD HAVE DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY NERVOUSNESS OR EXCITEMENT I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WE'VE UNDERRATED THEM SAID HARRY JUST AS THE PEOPLE UP NORTH HAVE UNDERRATED US
8346-244446-0019 COLONEL TALBOT TOLD ME LONG AGO THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A TERRIBLY BIG WAR AND NOW I KNOW HE WAS RIGHT A LONG TIME PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEMONSTRATION ON THE PART OF THE ENEMY THE SUN REACHED THE ZENITH AND BLAZED
8346-244446-0020 REDLY UPON THE MEN IN THE FORT HARRY LOOKED LONGINGLY AT THE DARK GREEN WOODS HE REMEMBERED COOL BROOKS SWELLING INTO DEEP POOLS HERE AND THERE IN JUST SUCH WOODS AS THESE IN WHICH HE USED TO BATHE WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY
8346-244446-0021 AN INTENSE WISH TO SWIM AGAIN IN THE COOL WATERS SEIZED HIM HE BELIEVED IT WAS SO INTENSE BECAUSE THOSE BEAUTIFUL WOODS THERE ON THE SLOPE WHERE THE RUNNING WATER MUST BE WERE FILLED WITH THE NORTHERN RIFLEMEN
8346-244446-0022 THREE SCOUTS SENT OUT BY COLONEL TALBOT RETURNED WITH REPORTS THAT JUSTIFIED HIS SUSPICIONS A HEAVY FORCE EVIDENTLY FROM PATTERSON'S ARMY OPERATING IN THE HILLS AND MOUNTAINS WAS MARCHING DOWN THE VALLEY TO JOIN THOSE
8346-244446-0023 WHO HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM THE FORT THE JUNCTION WOULD BE FORMED WITHIN AN HOUR HARRY WAS PRESENT WHEN THE REPORT WAS MADE AND HE UNDERSTOOD ITS SIGNIFICANCE HE REJOICED THAT THE WALLS OF EARTH HAD BEEN THROWN SO MUCH HIGHER
8346-244446-0024 AND THAT THE TRENCHES HAD BEEN DUG SO MUCH DEEPER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE COOL SHADE WAS BEGINNING TO FALL ON THE EASTERN FOREST THEY NOTICED A MOVEMENT IN THE WOODS THEY SAW THE SWAYING OF BUSHES AND THE OFFICERS WHO HAD GLASSES
8346-244446-0025 CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF THE MEN MOVING IN THE UNDERGROWTH THEN CAME A MIGHTY CRASH AND THE SHELLS FROM A BATTERY OF GREAT GUNS SANG IN THE AIR AND BURST ABOUT THEM IT WAS WELL FOR THE INVINCIBLES THAT THEY HAD DUG THEIR TRENCHES DEEP
8346-244446-0026 HARRY WAS WITH COLONEL TALBOT NOW ACTING AS AN AIDE AND HE HEARD THE LEADER'S QUIET COMMENT THE REINFORCEMENTS HAVE BROUGHT MORE BIG GUNS THEY WILL DELIVER A HEAVY CANNONADE AND THEN UNDER COVER OF THE SMOKE THEY WILL CHARGE
8346-244446-0027 LIEUTENANT KENTON TELL OUR GUNNERS THAT IT IS MY POSITIVE ORDERS THAT THEY ARE NOT TO FIRE A SINGLE SHOT UNTIL I GIVE THE WORD THE YANKEES CAN SEE US BUT WE CANNOT SEE THEM AND WE'LL SAVE OUR AMMUNITION FOR THEIR CHARGE
8346-244446-0028 THE INVINCIBLES HUGGED THEIR SHELTER GLADLY ENOUGH WHILE THE FIRE FROM THE GREAT GUNS CONTINUED A SECOND BATTERY OPENED FROM A POINT FURTHER DOWN THE SLOPE AND THE FORT WAS SWEPT BY A CROSS FIRE OF BALL AND SHELL YET
8346-244446-0029 THE LOSS OF LIFE WAS SMALL THE TRENCHES WERE SO DEEP AND SO WELL CONSTRUCTED THAT ONLY CHANCE PIECES OF SHELL STRUCK HUMAN TARGETS HARRY REMAINED WITH COLONEL TALBOT READY TO CARRY ANY ORDER THAT HE MIGHT GIVE
8346-244446-0030 THE COLONEL PEERED OVER THE EARTHWORK AT INTERVALS AND SEARCHED THE WOODS CLOSELY WITH A POWERFUL PAIR OF GLASSES HIS FACE WAS VERY GRAVE BUT HARRY PRESENTLY SAW HIM SMILE A LITTLE HE WONDERED BUT HE HAD LEARNED ENOUGH OF DISCIPLINE
8346-244446-0031 NOW NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF HIS COMMANDING OFFICER AT LENGTH HE HEARD THE COLONEL MUTTER IT IS CARRINGTON IT SURELY MUST BE CARRINGTON A THIRD BATTERY NOW OPENED AT A POINT ALMOST MIDWAY BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO
8346-244446-0032 AND THE SMILE OF THE COLONEL CAME AGAIN BUT NOW IT LINGERED LONGER IT IS BOUND TO BE CARRINGTON HE SAID IT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE ANY OTHER
8346-244446-0033 THAT WAY OF OPENING WITH A BATTERY ON ONE FLANK THEN ON THE OTHER AND THEN WITH A THIRD MIDWAY BETWEEN WAS ALWAYS HIS
8346-244446-0034 HEAVENS WHAT AN ARTILLERY OFFICER I DOUBT WHETHER THERE IS SUCH ANOTHER IN EITHER ARMY OR IN THE WORLD AND HE IS BETTER TOO THAN EVER HE CAUGHT HARRY LOOKING AT HIM IN WONDER AND HE SMILED ONCE MORE
8346-244446-0035 A FRIEND OF MINE COMMANDS THE NORTHERN ARTILLERY HE SAID I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM OF COURSE BUT HE IS MAKING ALL THE SIGNS AND USING ALL THE PASSWORDS WE ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AGE AND WE WERE CHUMS AT WEST POINT
8346-244446-0036 WE WERE TOGETHER IN THE INDIAN WARS AND TOGETHER IN ALL THE BATTLES FROM VERA CRUZ TO THE CITY OF MEXICO IT'S JOHN CARRINGTON AND HE'S FROM NEW YORK HE'S PERFECTLY WONDERFUL WITH THE GUNS LORD LAD LOOK HOW HE LIVES UP TO HIS REPUTATION
8346-244446-0037 NOT A SHOT MISSES HE MUST HAVE BEEN TRAINING THOSE GUNNERS FOR MONTHS THUNDER BUT THAT WAS MAGNIFICENT A HUGE SHELL STRUCK SQUARELY IN THE CENTER OF THE EARTHWORK BURST WITH A TERRIBLE CRASH
8346-244446-0038 AND SENT STEEL SPLINTERS AND FRAGMENTS FLYING IN EVERY DIRECTION A RAIN OF DIRT FOLLOWED THE RAIN OF STEEL AND WHEN THE COLONEL WIPED THE LAST MOTE FROM HIS EYE HE SAID TRIUMPHANTLY AND JOYOUSLY IT'S CARRINGTON NOT A SHADOW OF DOUBT CAN BE LEFT
8346-244446-0039 OH I TELL YOU HARRY HE'S A MARVEL HAS THE WONDERFUL MATHEMATICAL AND ENGINEERING EYE THE EYES OF COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT BEAMED WITH ADMIRATION OF HIS OLD COMRADE MINGLED WITH A STRONG AFFECTION
8346-244446-0040 NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT RELAX HIS VIGILANCE AND CAUTION FOR AN INSTANT HE MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE FORT AND SAW THAT EVERYTHING WAS READY THE SOUTHERN RIFLEMEN LINED EVERY EARTHWORK AND THE GUNS HAD BEEN WHEELED INTO THE BEST POSITIONS WITH THE GUNNERS READY
8346-244446-0041 THEN HE RETURNED TO HIS OLD PLACE THE CHARGE WILL COME SOON LIEUTENANT KENTON HE SAID TO HARRY THEIR CANNONADE SERVES A DOUBLE PURPOSE IT KEEPS US BUSY DODGING BALL AND SHELL
8346-244446-0042 AND IT CREATES A BANK OF SMOKE THROUGH WHICH THEIR INFANTRY CAN ADVANCE ALMOST TO THE FORT AND YET REMAIN HIDDEN SEE HOW THE SMOKE COVERS THE WHOLE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
8346-244446-0043 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN HIM TO DO BETTER HARRY WISHED THAT CARRINGTON WOULD NOT DO QUITE SO WELL HE WAS TIRED OF CROUCHING IN A DITCH HE WAS GROWING SOMEWHAT USED TO THE HIDEOUS HOWLING OF THE SHELLS BUT IT WAS STILL UNSAFE
8346-244446-0044 ANYWHERE EXCEPT IN THE TRENCHES IT SEEMED TO HIM TOO THAT THE CANNON FIRE WAS INCREASING IN VOLUME
8346-244446-0045 HEAVIER AND HEAVIER GREW THE BANK OF SMOKE OVER AND AGAINST THE FOREST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE BUT HARRY HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE NORTHERN REGIMENTS WERE MASSING THEMSELVES FOR THE ATTACK THE YOUTH REMAINED WITH COLONEL TALBOT
8346-244446-0046 BEING HELD BY THE LATTER TO CARRY ORDERS WHEN NEEDED TO OTHER POINTS IN THE FORT SAINT CLAIR AND LANGDON WERE KEPT NEAR FOR A SIMILAR USE AND THEY WERE CROUCHING IN THE SAME TRENCH IF EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR THE BEST IT'S TIME IT WAS HAPPENING SAID LANGDON IN AN IMPATIENT WHISPER
8346-244446-0047 THESE SHELLS AND CANNON BALLS FLYING OVER ME MAKE MY HEAD ACHE AND SCARE ME TO DEATH BESIDES IF THE YANKEES DON'T HURRY UP AND CHARGE THEY'LL FIND ME DEAD KILLED BY THE COLLAPSE OF WORN OUT NERVES I INTEND TO BE READY WHEN THEY COME SAID SAINT CLAIR
8346-244446-0048 I'VE MADE EVERY PREPARATION THAT I CAN CALL TO MIND WHICH MEANS THAT YOUR COAT MUST BE SETTING JUST RIGHT AND THAT YOUR COLLAR ISN'T RUFFLED REJOINED LANGDON YES ARTHUR YOU ARE READY NOW YOU ARE CERTAINLY THE NEATEST AND BEST DRESSED MAN IN THE REGIMENT
8346-244446-0049 IF THE YANKEES TAKE US THEY CAN'T SAY THAT THEY CAPTURED A SLOVENLY PRISONER THEN SAID SAINT CLAIR SMILING LET THEM COME ON THEIR CANNON FIRE IS SINKING EXCLAIMED COLONEL TALBOT IN A MINUTE IT WILL CEASE AND THEN WILL COME THE CHARGE
8346-244446-0050 TIS CARRINGTON'S WAY AND A GOOD WAY HARK LISTEN TO IT THE SIGNAL READY MEN READY HERE THEY COME THE GREAT CANNONADE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE STILLNESS WAS MORE AWFUL THAN THE THUNDER OF THE GUNS HAD BEEN
8346-244446-0051 THE RECRUITS COULD HEAR THE GREAT PULSES IN THEIR TEMPLES THROBBING THEN THE SILENCE WAS PIERCED BY THE SHRILL NOTES OF A BRAZEN BUGLE STEADILY RISING HIGHER AND ALWAYS CALLING INSISTENTLY TO THE MEN TO COME
8346-244446-0052 THEN THEY HEARD THE HEAVY THUD OF MANY MEN ADVANCING WITH SWIFTNESS AND REGULARITY THE SOUTHERN TROOPS WERE AT THE EARTHWORKS IN DOUBLE ROWS AND THE GUNNERS WERE AT THE GUNS ALL EAGER ALL WATCHING INTENTLY FOR WHAT MIGHT COME OUT OF THE SMOKE
8346-244446-0053 AND VAPORS AND WHIRLED THE WHOLE ASIDE THEN HARRY SAW HE SAW A LONG LINE OF MEN THEIR FRONT BRISTLING WITH THE BLUE STEEL OF BAYONETS AND BEHIND THEM OTHER LINES AND YET OTHER LINES
8346-244446-0054 IT SEEMED TO HARRY THAT THE POINTS OF THE BAYONETS WERE ALMOST IN HIS FACE AND THEN AT THE SHOUTED COMMAND THE WHOLE EARTHWORK BURST INTO A BLAZE THE CANNON AND HUNDREDS OF RIFLES SENT THEIR DEADLY VOLLEYS
8346-244446-0055 THE FORT HAD TURNED INTO A VOLCANO POURING FORTH A RAIN OF FIRE AND DEADLY MISSILES THE FRONT LINE OF THE NORTHERN FORCE WAS SHOT AWAY BUT THE NEXT LINE TOOK ITS PLACE AND RUSHED AT THE FORT
8346-244446-0056 WITH THOSE BEHIND PRESSING CLOSE AFTER THEM THE DEFENDERS LOADED AND FIRED AS FAST AS THEY COULD AND THE HIGH WALLS OF EARTH HELPED THEM THE LOOSE DIRT GAVE AWAY AS THE NORTHERN MEN ATTEMPTED TO CLIMB THEM AND DIRT AND MEN
8346-244446-0057 FELL TOGETHER BACK TO THE BOTTOM THE NORTHERN GUNNERS IN THE REAR OF THE ATTACK COULD NOT FIRE FOR FEAR OF HITTING THEIR OWN TROOPS BUT THE SOUTHERN CANNON AT THE EMBRASURES HAD A CLEAR TARGET SHOT AND SHELL CRASHED INTO THE NORTHERN RANKS
8346-244446-0058 AND THE DEADLY HAIL OF BULLETS BEAT UPON THEM WITHOUT CEASING BUT STILL THEY CAME THE MECHANICS AND MILL HANDS ARE AS GOOD AS ANYBODY IT APPEARS SHOUTED SAINT CLAIR IN HARRY'S EAR AND HARRY NODDED
8346-244446-0059 BUT THE DEFENSES OF THE FORT WERE TOO STRONG THE CHARGE DRIVEN HOME WITH RECKLESS COURAGE BEAT IN VAIN UPON THOSE HIGH EARTHEN WALLS BEHIND WHICH THE DEFENDERS STANDING UPON NARROW PLATFORMS
8346-244446-0060 THE ASSAILANTS BROKE AT LAST AND ONCE MORE THE SHRILL NOTES OF THE BRAZEN BUGLE PIERCED THE AIR BUT INSTEAD OF SAYING COME IT SAID FALL BACK FALL BACK AND THE GREAT CLOUDS OF SMOKE THAT HAD PROTECTED THE NORTHERN ADVANCE
8346-244446-0061 NOW COVERED THE NORTHERN RETREAT THE FIRING HAD BEEN SO RAPID AND SO HEAVY THAT THE WHOLE FIELD IN FRONT OF THE FORT WAS COVERED WITH SMOKE THROUGH WHICH THEY CAUGHT ONLY THE GLEAM OF BAYONETS AND GLIMPSES OF BATTLE FLAGS
8346-244446-0062 BUT THEY KNEW THAT THE NORTHERN TROOPS WERE RETIRING CARRYING WITH THEM THEIR WOUNDED BUT LEAVING THE DEAD BEHIND HARRY EXCITED AND EAGER WAS ABOUT TO LEAP UPON THE CREST OF THE EARTHWORK BUT COLONEL TALBOT SHARPLY ORDERED HIM DOWN
8346-244446-0063 YOU'D BE KILLED INSIDE OF A MINUTE HE CRIED CARRINGTON IS OUT THERE WITH THE GUNS AS SOON AS THEIR TROOPS ARE FAR ENOUGH BACK HE'LL OPEN ON US WITH THE CANNON AND HE'LL RAKE THIS FORT LIKE A HURRICANE BEATING UPON A FOREST
8346-244446-0064 ONLY THE EARTHWORKS WILL PROTECT US FROM CERTAIN DESTRUCTION HE SENT THE ORDER FIERCE AND SHARP ALONG THE LINE FOR EVERY ONE TO KEEP UNDER COVER AND THERE WAS AMPLE PROOF SOON THAT HE KNEW HIS MAN
8346-244446-0065 THE NORTHERN INFANTRY HAD RETIRED AND THE SMOKE IN FRONT WAS BEGINNING TO LIFT WHEN THE FIGURE OF A TALL MAN IN BLUE APPEARED ON A HILLOCK AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST HARRY WHO HAD SNATCHED UP A RIFLE LEVELLED IT INSTANTLY AND TOOK AIM
8346-244446-0066 BUT BEFORE HIS FINGER COULD PULL THE TRIGGER COLONEL TALBOT KNOCKED IT DOWN AGAIN MY GOD HE EXCLAIMED I WAS BARELY IN TIME TO SAVE HIM IT WAS CARRINGTON HIMSELF
8346-244446-0067 OUR ENEMY OUR OFFICIAL ENEMY YES BUT MY FRIEND MY LIFE LONG FRIEND
8346-244446-0068 WE SLEPT UNDER THE SAME BLANKET ON THE ICY PLATEAUX OF MEXICO NO HARRY I COULD NOT LET YOU OR ANY OTHER SLAY HIM THE FIGURE DISAPPEARED FROM THE HILLOCK AND THE NEXT MOMENT THE GREAT GUNS OPENED AGAIN FROM THE FOREST
8346-244446-0069 THE ORDERS OF COLONEL TALBOT HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN A MOMENT TOO SOON HUGE SHELLS AND BALLS RAKED THE FORT ONCE MORE AND THE DEFENDERS CROUCHED LOWER THAN EVER IN THE TRENCHES HARRY SURMISED THAT THE NEW CANNONADE
8346-244446-0070 WAS INTENDED MAINLY TO PREVENT A POSSIBLE RETURN ATTACK BY THE SOUTHERN TROOPS BUT THEY WERE TOO CAUTIOUS TO VENTURE FROM THEIR EARTHWORKS THE INVINCIBLES HAD GROWN MANY YEARS OLDER IN A FEW HOURS
8346-244446-0071 WHEN IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT NO SALLY WOULD BE MADE FROM THE FORT THE FIRE OF THE CANNON IN FRONT CEASED AND THE SMOKE LIFTED DISCLOSING A FIELD BLACK WITH THE SLAIN HARRY LOOKED SHUDDERED AND REFUSED TO LOOK AGAIN
8346-244446-0072 THEY ARE THERE YET AND THEY WILL REMAIN HE ANNOUNCED AT LAST WE HAVE BEATEN BACK THE ASSAULT THEY MAY HOLD US HERE UNTIL A GREAT ARMY COMES AND WITH HEAVY LOSS TO THEM BUT WE ARE YET BESIEGED CARRINGTON WILL NOT LET US REST
8346-244446-0073 HE WILL SEND A SHELL TO SOME PART OF THIS FORT EVERY THREE OR FOUR MINUTES YOU WILL SEE THEY HEARD A ROAR AND HISS A MINUTE LATER AND A SHELL BURST INSIDE THE WALLS THROUGH ALL THE AFTERNOON CARRINGTON PLAYED UPON THE SHAKEN NERVES OF THE INVINCIBLES
8346-244446-0074 IT SEEMED THAT HE COULD MAKE HIS SHELLS HIT WHEREVER HE WISHED IF A RECRUIT LEFT A TRENCH IT WAS ONLY TO MAKE A RUSH FOR ANOTHER IF THEIR NERVES SETTLED DOWN FOR A MOMENT THAT SOLEMN BOOM FROM THE FOREST AND THE SHRIEK OF THE SHELL
8346-244446-0075 MADE THEM JUMP AGAIN WONDERFUL WONDERFUL MURMURED COLONEL TALBOT BUT TERRIBLY TRYING TO NEW MEN CARRINGTON CERTAINLY GROWS BETTER WITH THE YEARS HARRY TRIED TO COMPOSE HIMSELF AND REST AS HE LAY IN THE TRENCH WITH SAINT CLAIR AND LANGDON
8346-244446-0076 THEY HAD HAD THEIR BATTLE FACE TO FACE AND ALL THREE OF THEM WERE TERRIBLY SHAKEN BUT THEY RECOVERED THEMSELVES AT LAST DESPITE THE SHELLS WHICH BURST AT SHORT BUT IRREGULAR INTERVALS INSIDE THE FORT THUS THE LAST HOURS OF THE AFTERNOON WANED
8346-244446-0077 AND AS THE TWILIGHT CAME THEY WENT MORE FREELY ABOUT THE FORT COLONEL TALBOT CALLED A CONFERENCE OF THE SENIOR OFFICERS IN A CORNER OF THE ENCLOSURE WELL UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE EARTHEN WALLS
