6574-70756-0000 THE BEING FINISHED SPEAKING AND FIXED HIS LOOKS UPON ME IN THE EXPECTATION OF A REPLY BUT I WAS BEWILDERED PERPLEXED AND UNABLE TO ARRANGE MY IDEAS SUFFICIENTLY TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL EXTENT OF HIS PROPOSITION HE CONTINUED
6574-70756-0001 YOU MUST CREATE A FEMALE FOR ME WITH WHOM I CAN LIVE IN THE INTERCHANGE OF THOSE SYMPATHIES NECESSARY FOR MY BEING THIS YOU ALONE CAN DO AND I DEMAND IT OF YOU AS A RIGHT WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE TO CONCEDE
6574-70756-0002 THE LATTER PART OF HIS TALE HAD KINDLED ANEW IN ME THE ANGER THAT HAD DIED AWAY WHILE HE NARRATED HIS PEACEFUL LIFE AMONG THE COTTAGERS AND AS HE SAID THIS I COULD NO LONGER SUPPRESS THE RAGE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME I DO REFUSE IT I REPLIED
6574-70756-0003 AND NO TORTURE SHALL EVER EXTORT A CONSENT FROM ME YOU MAY RENDER ME THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN BUT YOU SHALL NEVER MAKE ME BASE IN MY OWN EYES SHALL I CREATE ANOTHER LIKE YOURSELF WHOSE JOINT WICKEDNESS MIGHT DESOLATE THE WORLD BEGONE
6574-70756-0004 I HAVE ANSWERED YOU YOU MAY TORTURE ME BUT I WILL NEVER CONSENT YOU ARE IN THE WRONG REPLIED THE FIEND AND INSTEAD OF THREATENING I AM CONTENT TO REASON WITH YOU I AM MALICIOUS BECAUSE I AM MISERABLE
6574-70756-0005 AM I NOT SHUNNED AND HATED BY ALL MANKIND YOU MY CREATOR WOULD TEAR ME TO PIECES AND TRIUMPH REMEMBER THAT AND TELL ME WHY I SHOULD PITY MAN MORE THAN HE PITIES ME
6574-70756-0006 YOU WOULD NOT CALL IT MURDER IF YOU COULD PRECIPITATE ME INTO ONE OF THOSE ICE RIFTS AND DESTROY MY FRAME THE WORK OF YOUR OWN HANDS SHALL I RESPECT MAN WHEN HE CONDEMNS ME LET HIM LIVE WITH ME IN THE INTERCHANGE OF KINDNESS AND INSTEAD OF INJURY
6574-70756-0007 I WOULD BESTOW EVERY BENEFIT UPON HIM WITH TEARS OF GRATITUDE AT HIS ACCEPTANCE BUT THAT CANNOT BE THE HUMAN SENSES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS TO OUR UNION YET MINE SHALL NOT BE THE SUBMISSION OF ABJECT SLAVERY
6574-70756-0008 I WILL WORK AT YOUR DESTRUCTION NOR FINISH UNTIL I DESOLATE YOUR HEART SO THAT YOU SHALL CURSE THE HOUR OF YOUR BIRTH A FIENDISH RAGE ANIMATED HIM AS HE SAID THIS
6574-70756-0009 HIS FACE WAS WRINKLED INTO CONTORTIONS TOO HORRIBLE FOR HUMAN EYES TO BEHOLD BUT PRESENTLY HE CALMED HIMSELF AND PROCEEDED I INTENDED TO REASON THIS PASSION IS DETRIMENTAL TO ME FOR YOU DO NOT REFLECT THAT YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF ITS EXCESS
6574-70756-0010 IF ANY BEING FELT EMOTIONS OF BENEVOLENCE TOWARDS ME I SHOULD RETURN THEM A HUNDRED AND A HUNDREDFOLD FOR THAT ONE CREATURE'S SAKE I WOULD MAKE PEACE WITH THE WHOLE KIND BUT I NOW INDULGE IN DREAMS OF BLISS THAT CANNOT BE REALIZED
6574-70756-0011 WHAT I ASK OF YOU IS REASONABLE AND MODERATE I DEMAND A CREATURE OF ANOTHER SEX BUT AS HIDEOUS AS MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION IS SMALL BUT IT IS ALL THAT I CAN RECEIVE AND IT SHALL CONTENT ME
6574-70756-0012 IT IS TRUE WE SHALL BE MONSTERS CUT OFF FROM ALL THE WORLD BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT WE SHALL BE MORE ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER OUR LIVES WILL NOT BE HAPPY BUT THEY WILL BE HARMLESS AND FREE FROM THE MISERY I NOW FEEL OH MY CREATOR
6574-70756-0013 MAKE ME HAPPY LET ME FEEL GRATITUDE TOWARDS YOU FOR ONE BENEFIT LET ME SEE THAT I EXCITE THE SYMPATHY OF SOME EXISTING THING DO NOT DENY ME MY REQUEST I WAS MOVED
6574-70756-0014 I SHUDDERED WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF MY CONSENT BUT I FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME JUSTICE IN HIS ARGUMENT HIS TALE AND THE FEELINGS HE NOW EXPRESSED PROVED HIM TO BE A CREATURE OF FINE SENSATIONS
6574-70756-0015 AND DID I NOT AS HIS MAKER OWE HIM ALL THE PORTION OF HAPPINESS THAT IT WAS IN MY POWER TO BESTOW HE SAW MY CHANGE OF FEELING AND CONTINUED IF YOU CONSENT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING SHALL EVER SEE US AGAIN
6574-70756-0016 I WILL GO TO THE VAST WILDS OF SOUTH AMERICA MY FOOD IS NOT THAT OF MAN I DO NOT DESTROY THE LAMB AND THE KID TO GLUT MY APPETITE ACORNS AND BERRIES AFFORD ME SUFFICIENT NOURISHMENT MY COMPANION WILL BE OF THE SAME NATURE AS MYSELF
6574-70756-0017 AND WILL BE CONTENT WITH THE SAME FARE WE SHALL MAKE OUR BED OF DRIED LEAVES THE SUN WILL SHINE ON US AS ON MAN AND WILL RIPEN OUR FOOD THE PICTURE I PRESENT TO YOU IS PEACEFUL AND HUMAN
6574-70756-0018 PITILESS AS YOU HAVE BEEN TOWARDS ME I NOW SEE COMPASSION IN YOUR EYES LET ME SEIZE THE FAVOURABLE MOMENT AND PERSUADE YOU TO PROMISE WHAT I SO ARDENTLY DESIRE YOU PROPOSE REPLIED I
6574-70756-0019 TO FLY FROM THE HABITATIONS OF MAN TO DWELL IN THOSE WILDS WHERE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD WILL BE YOUR ONLY COMPANIONS HOW CAN YOU WHO LONG FOR THE LOVE AND SYMPATHY OF MAN PERSEVERE IN THIS EXILE
6574-70756-0020 YOU WILL RETURN AND AGAIN SEEK THEIR KINDNESS AND YOU WILL MEET WITH THEIR DETESTATION YOUR EVIL PASSIONS WILL BE RENEWED AND YOU WILL THEN HAVE A COMPANION TO AID YOU IN THE TASK OF DESTRUCTION THIS MAY NOT BE CEASE TO ARGUE THE POINT FOR I CANNOT CONSENT
6574-70756-0021 HOW INCONSTANT ARE YOUR FEELINGS BUT A MOMENT AGO YOU WERE MOVED BY MY REPRESENTATIONS AND WHY DO YOU AGAIN HARDEN YOURSELF TO MY COMPLAINTS I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE EARTH WHICH I INHABIT AND BY YOU THAT MADE ME
6574-70756-0022 THAT WITH THE COMPANION YOU BESTOW I WILL QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND DWELL AS IT MAY CHANCE IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF PLACES MY EVIL PASSIONS WILL HAVE FLED FOR I SHALL MEET WITH SYMPATHY MY LIFE WILL FLOW QUIETLY AWAY
6574-70756-0023 AND IN MY DYING MOMENTS I SHALL NOT CURSE MY MAKER HIS WORDS HAD A STRANGE EFFECT UPON ME I COMPASSIONATED HIM
6574-70756-0024 WHEN I SAW THE FILTHY MASS THAT MOVED AND TALKED MY HEART SICKENED AND MY FEELINGS WERE ALTERED TO THOSE OF HORROR AND HATRED I TRIED TO STIFLE THESE SENSATIONS I THOUGHT THAT AS I COULD NOT SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM
6574-70756-0025 I HAD NO RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THE SMALL PORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICH WAS YET IN MY POWER TO BESTOW YOU SWEAR I SAID TO BE HARMLESS BUT HAVE YOU NOT ALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUST YOU
6574-70756-0026 MUST BE MY PORTION THE LOVE OF ANOTHER WILL DESTROY THE CAUSE OF MY CRIMES AND I SHALL BECOME A THING OF WHOSE EXISTENCE EVERYONE WILL BE IGNORANT
6574-70756-0027 AND MY VIRTUES WILL NECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL
6574-70756-0028 AND BECOME LINKED TO THE CHAIN OF EXISTENCE AND EVENTS FROM WHICH I AM NOW EXCLUDED I PAUSED SOME TIME TO REFLECT ON ALL HE HAD RELATED AND THE VARIOUS ARGUMENTS WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED I THOUGHT OF THE PROMISE OF VIRTUES WHICH HE HAD DISPLAYED ON THE OPENING OF HIS EXISTENCE
6574-70756-0029 HIS POWER AND THREATS WERE NOT OMITTED IN MY CALCULATIONS A CREATURE WHO COULD EXIST IN THE ICE CAVES OF THE GLACIERS AND HIDE HIMSELF FROM PURSUIT AMONG THE RIDGES OF INACCESSIBLE PRECIPICES WAS A BEING POSSESSING FACULTIES IT WOULD BE VAIN TO COPE WITH
6574-70756-0030 AFTER A LONG PAUSE OF REFLECTION I CONCLUDED THAT THE JUSTICE DUE BOTH TO HIM AND MY FELLOW CREATURES DEMANDED OF ME THAT I SHOULD COMPLY WITH HIS REQUEST TURNING TO HIM THEREFORE I SAID I CONSENT TO YOUR DEMAND
6574-70756-0031 ON YOUR SOLEMN OATH TO QUIT EUROPE FOREVER AND EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AS SOON AS I SHALL DELIVER INTO YOUR HANDS A FEMALE WHO WILL ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR EXILE I SWEAR HE CRIED BY THE SUN
6574-70756-0032 AND BY THE BLUE SKY OF HEAVEN AND BY THE FIRE OF LOVE THAT BURNS MY HEART THAT IF YOU GRANT MY PRAYER WHILE THEY EXIST YOU SHALL NEVER BEHOLD ME AGAIN DEPART TO YOUR HOME AND COMMENCE YOUR LABOURS
6574-70756-0033 AND FEAR NOT BUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY I SHALL APPEAR SAYING THIS HE SUDDENLY QUITTED ME FEARFUL PERHAPS OF ANY CHANGE IN MY SENTIMENTS I SAW HIM DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN THE FLIGHT OF AN EAGLE AND QUICKLY LOST AMONG THE UNDULATIONS OF THE SEA OF ICE
6574-70756-0034 HIS TALE HAD OCCUPIED THE WHOLE DAY AND THE SUN WAS UPON THE VERGE OF THE HORIZON WHEN HE DEPARTED I KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO HASTEN MY DESCENT TOWARDS THE VALLEY AS I SHOULD SOON BE ENCOMPASSED IN DARKNESS BUT MY HEART WAS HEAVY AND MY STEPS SLOW
6574-70756-0035 THE LABOUR OF WINDING AMONG THE LITTLE PATHS OF THE MOUNTAIN AND FIXING MY FEET FIRMLY AS I ADVANCED PERPLEXED ME OCCUPIED AS I WAS BY THE EMOTIONS WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY HAD PRODUCED NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED WHEN I CAME TO THE HALFWAY RESTING PLACE AND SEATED MYSELF BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN
6574-70756-0036 THE STARS SHONE AT INTERVALS AS THE CLOUDS PASSED FROM OVER THEM THE DARK PINES ROSE BEFORE ME AND EVERY HERE AND THERE A BROKEN TREE LAY ON THE GROUND IT WAS A SCENE OF WONDERFUL SOLEMNITY AND STIRRED STRANGE THOUGHTS WITHIN ME I WEPT BITTERLY
6574-70756-0037 AND CLASPING MY HANDS IN AGONY I EXCLAIMED OH STARS AND CLOUDS AND WINDS YE ARE ALL ABOUT TO MOCK ME IF YE REALLY PITY ME CRUSH SENSATION AND MEMORY LET ME BECOME AS NOUGHT BUT IF NOT DEPART
6574-70756-0038 DEPART AND LEAVE ME IN DARKNESS THESE WERE WILD AND MISERABLE THOUGHTS BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW I LISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITS WAY TO CONSUME ME
6574-70756-0039 I TOOK NO REST BUT RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TO GENEVA EVEN IN MY OWN HEART I COULD GIVE NO EXPRESSION TO MY SENSATIONS THEY WEIGHED ON ME WITH A MOUNTAIN'S WEIGHT AND THEIR EXCESS DESTROYED MY AGONY BENEATH THEM
6574-70756-0040 THUS I RETURNED HOME AND ENTERING THE HOUSE PRESENTED MYSELF TO THE FAMILY MY HAGGARD AND WILD APPEARANCE AWOKE INTENSE ALARM BUT I ANSWERED NO QUESTION SCARCELY DID I SPEAK I FELT AS IF I WERE PLACED UNDER A BAN AS IF I HAD NO RIGHT TO CLAIM THEIR SYMPATHIES
6574-70756-0041 AS IF NEVER MORE MIGHT I ENJOY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THEM YET EVEN THUS I LOVED THEM TO ADORATION AND TO SAVE THEM I RESOLVED TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO MY MOST ABHORRED TASK THE PROSPECT OF SUCH AN OCCUPATION MADE EVERY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF EXISTENCE PASS BEFORE ME LIKE A DREAM
