7433-89656-0000 THE UTMOST REASON PREVAILS FOR ALL OF HER ACTS BUT THE SIMPLEST OF NATURE'S LAWS APPEARS COMPLEX AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO THE APEMAN
7433-89656-0001 FOR SELF GRATIFICATION INSTEAD OF AN INSTRUMENT TO GRASP NATURAL LAWS FOR WHICH PURPOSE IT IS INTENDED AND THEREFORE
7433-89656-0002 BY MISUSING IT FOR THE BASE PURPOSE OF ACCUMULATING INDIVIDUAL WEALTH OUR GREAT MEN UTILIZED THEIR BRAINS TO RECEIVE UNDERSTAND AND OPERATE THE WISE LAWS ESTABLISHED BY NATURE
7433-89656-0003 OF ALL MANKIND AND THEREIN LIES THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PIECE OF HUMAN MACHINERY YOUR SOUL NOW OCCUPIES AND THAT WHICH IT ONCE DIRECTED
7433-89656-0004 BEHOLD SAID SHE DRAMATICALLY POINTING AT THE DIRECTOR OF THE BAND THAT YOU WERE AND THEN CASTING HER EYES UPON ME THAT YOU ARE DOES YOUR MIND LACK THE STRENGTH TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE MAGNIFICENT LESSON
7433-89656-0005 AND WHICH NO DOUBT STANDS UNPARALLELED IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR SPECIES OH IF EACH LITTLE APEMAN COULD ONLY BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT
7433-89656-0006 THE PRESENT BODY IS BUT ONE LITTLE INSTALLMENT OF THE INNUMERABLE LIVES HIS SOUL HAS TO PRESIDE OVER AND THAT THE RICH AND POWERFUL TODAY MAY BE THE WEAK AND LOWLY TOMORROW
7433-89656-0007 HE WOULD BEGIN AT ONCE TO TREAT ALL LIVING THINGS WITH EQUAL KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY IF HE COULD ONLY REALIZE THAT THE DOG HE KICKS THE HORSE HE MISTREATS
7433-89656-0008 OR THE POOR MENTAL OR PHYSICAL WEAKLING HE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF MIGHT POSSIBLY BE IMPELLED BY THE SAME SOUL THAT MOVED THE FORM OF HIS DECEASED FATHER MOTHER OR OFFSPRING
7433-89656-0009 HIS SELFISHNESS AND CRUELTY WOULD VANISH FOREVER IF HE COULD ONLY COMPREHEND THAT THE SOUL SUFFERS AS WELL AS THE FLESH IT STIMULATES AND THAT IT MUST NATURALLY CONTINUE TO DO SO
7433-89656-0010 MORE OR LESS UNTIL EVERY PARTICLE OF LIVING MATTER
7433-89656-0011 HIMSELF AND URGE OTHERS TO DO LIKEWISE
7433-89656-0012 A MOMENT OF SELFISH PLEASURE NOW MEANS AN AGE OF SUFFERING AND TORMENT IN THE FUTURE SUCH ARE THE IMMUTABLE LAWS OF NATURE
7433-89656-0013 AND THESE LAWS MUST BE OBEYED BEFORE MANKIND CAN CLIMB THE LADDER OF GREATNESS IT SOMETIMES APPEARS AS IF NATURAL LAW WORKS VERY SLOWLY BEFORE REACHING A GIVEN POINT
7433-89656-0014 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A REASON FOR EVERY ONE OF ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE APPARENTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE STILL IT WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN ETERNAL LAW
7433-89656-0015 MIGHT HAVE REMAINED HERE FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS HAD YOU NOT COME BACK TO RELEASE IT FROM ITS PECULIAR BONDAGE BUT YOU DID RETURN AND NATURE THEREBY DEMONSTRATED THAT IT NEVER FORGETS ANYTHING
7433-89656-0016 FROM THE WORKINGS OF THE GREAT LIVING THINGS OF WHICH THE SUNS MOONS AND PLANETS ARE BUT MERE ORGANS
7433-89656-0017 FIRST BY A NATURAL COURSE OF INSTRUCTION YOU PROVED TO THE SAGEMEN
7433-89656-0018 AND HAVE HAD A POSITIVE MANIFESTATION OF THE IDENTICAL PRINCIPLE THUS ESTABLISHED IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT RESURRECT AND MAKE KNOWN TO ALL MANKIND THE UNALTERABLE TRUTH NATURAL LAW
7433-89656-0019 AFTER HAVING ALLOWED THE SAGEMEN TO REACH SUCH A STATE OF PHYSICAL MENTAL AND MORAL SUPERIORITY SHOULD DESTROY THEM JUST WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THE THRESHOLD OF SUCCESS NATURE DID NOT DESTROY THE SAGEMEN
7433-89656-0020 IF ONE OF YOUR LITTLE APEMEN EXPERIMENTS WITH STEAM OR DYNAMITE AND IS BLOWN TO ATOMS THAT IS HIS OWN FAULT NOT NATURE'S
7433-89656-0021 THEY HAD MASTERED THEMSELVES AND HAD LEARNED TO THINK BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY AND ALSO TO PROPERLY DISTRIBUTE AND ENJOY THE PRODUCTS OF THEIR COMBINED EFFORTS THEY HAD ACQUIRED
7433-89656-0022 A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PARTICLES OF WHICH THE EARTH IS COMPOSED AND HAD SECURED CONTROL OF THE ATMOSPHERE THAT SURROUNDS IT THEY HAD HARNESSED THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SUN AFTER REACHING THE EARTH
7433-89656-0023 AND HAD GAINED POSSESSION OF MANY OTHER VALUABLE UTILITIES BY FOLLOWING THE COURSE OF NATURAL LAW BUT WHEN THEY UNDERTOOK TO REGULATE THE EARTH'S PATH IN SPACE THEY SIMPLY OVER STEPPED
7433-89656-0024 THE CONFINES OF THEIR ABILITIES AND FAILED THAT WAS ONE OF NATURE'S LAWS THEY WERE NOT THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH HOWEVER AS IT REQUIRES MANY DRAWBACKS TO ACHIEVE EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS IN ALL THINGS
7433-89656-0025 BUT GRADUALLY WORK ITS WAY UP AGAIN
7433-89656-0026 IN THE GREAT STRETCH CALLED TIME THE LENGTH OF ONE LITTLE HUMAN EXISTENCE IS BUT A MERE FRACTION OF A MOMENT THEREFORE ONE SHOULD DEVOTE HIS BEST EFFORTS DURING THAT BRIEF PERIOD
7433-89656-0027 TO MAKING BETTER THE CONDITIONS OF THE PLACE IN WHICH HE HAS TO SPEND MANY LIVES FOR ACCORDING TO WHAT HE HAS DONE IN ONE LIFE SO MUST HE CONTEND
7433-89656-0028 HE ASSISTS IN UPHOLDING A CORRUPT SOCIAL SYSTEM WHICH TAKES FROM THE WEAK AND GIVES TO THE STRONG HE MUST EXPECT THESE SAME CONDITIONS TO EXIST WHEN HE RETURNS AS A WEAKLING
7433-89656-0029 FOR AS LONG AS HOGS ARE BRED AND SLAUGHTERED SO MUST HE TAKE HIS CHANCES OF BEING ONE OF THEM
7433-89656-0030 HOW MUCH BETTER TO HELP MANKIND SEEK A HIGHER PLANE OF INTELLIGENCE IN WHICH EQUALITY WOULD BE A REALITY THUS FIRMLY CEMENTING THE TIE OF SYMPATHY AND LOVE BETWEEN ALL LIVING THINGS
7433-89656-0031 IN THIS CASE HE WOULD HAVE NO FEAR CONCERNING HIS CHANCES UPON THE NEXT VISIT NO MATTER IN WHAT FORM HE MIGHT APPEAR AND HOW MUCH BETTER TO CARRY ON THE WORK OF DECREASING THE BIRTH OF THE LOWER ANIMALS
7433-89656-0032 UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT ON EARTH BUT THE VERY BEST TYPE OF HUMAN BEINGS FOR ALL SOULS TO INHABIT NATURAL LAW IS VERY EASILY UNDERSTOOD IF THE MIND IS PROPERLY DIRECTED TOWARD IT
7433-89656-0033 THIS PRINCIPLE PLAINLY SHOWS AN EVOLUTIONARY TENDENCY
7433-89656-0034 THIS INTELLIGENCE IS ABSORBED BY THE MIND THE MIND ITSELF IS EXPANDED IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY IT TAKES IN
7433-89656-0035 OR EVIL PURPOSES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL IS MERELY THAT BETWEEN UNSELFISHNESS AND SELFISHNESS
7433-89656-0036 FOR SELFISH ENDS AND HERE IS WHERE THE SOUL OR CONSCIENCE HAS ITS WORK TO PERFORM IN TRYING TO DIRECT IT INTO GOOD CHANNELS INTELLIGENCE MEANS THE ABILITY TO THINK OR UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHTS CONCEIVED BY OTHERS
7433-89656-0037 AS AN UNSELFISH MEDIUM WITH WHICH TO AID OTHERS THE POORLY DEVELOPED BRAIN STIFLES THE PLEADINGS OF THE CONSCIENCE AND UTILIZES IT AS A SELFISH WEAPON TO SECURE THE POWER TO TAKE FROM OTHERS
7433-89656-0038 THE BATTLE OF EXISTENCE IS CONSTANTLY CARRIED ON BETWEEN SELFISHNESS WHICH IS BRED FROM THE VERY LOWEST FORM OF INTELLIGENCE AND UNSELFISHNESS
7433-89656-0039 A WELL BALANCED MIND WANTS ALL MEN TO ENJOY EQUAL RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN COMMON WITH ONE ANOTHER AFFORDING EACH A CHANCE TO RISE AS HIGH AS HIS CAPABILITIES WILL PERMIT
