7679-276769-0024 WHEN EVERY SENSE AND FEELING PROVED EXPECTANCY OF BRIGHTEST DAY WHEN THE HAND TREMBLED TO RECEIVE A THRILLING CLASP WHICH SEEMED SO NEAR
7679-276769-0025 WHEN WORDS HALF LOVE ALL TENDERNESS WERE HOURLY HEARD AS HOURLY SPOKEN WHEN THE LONG SUNNY DAYS OF BLISS ONLY BY MOONLIGHT NIGHTS WERE BROKEN TILL DROP BY DROP THE CUP OF JOY FILLED FULL WITH PURPLE LIGHT WAS GLOWING
7679-276769-0026 SPARKLING STILL AND REDLY FLASHING DRAINED DROP BY DROP THE GENEROUS JUICE I SAW IT SINK AND STROVE TO TASTE IT MY EAGER LIPS APPROACHED THE BRIM THE MOVEMENT ONLY SEEMED TO WASTE IT
