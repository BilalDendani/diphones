157-126796-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THERE ARE WHOSE CHANGING LINEAMENTS EXPRESS EACH GUILELESS PASSION OF THE BREAST WHERE LOVE AND HOPE
157-126796-0001 AND TENDER HEARTED PITY ARE SEEN REFLECTED AS FROM A MIRROR'S FACE BUT COLD EXPERIENCE CAN VEIL THESE HUES WITH LOOKS INVENTED SHREWDLY TO ENCOMPASS
157-126796-0002 THE CUNNING PURPOSES OF BASE DECEIT DUO THE OFFICER TO WHOSE KEEPING DUNWOODIE
157-126796-0003 HAD COMMITTED THE PEDDLER TRANSFERRED HIS CHARGE TO THE CUSTODY OF THE REGULAR SERGEANT OF THE GUARD THE GIFT OF CAPTAIN WHARTON HAD NOT BEEN LOST ON THE YOUTHFUL LIEUTENANT
157-126796-0004 THAT HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF OBJECTS BEFORE HIS EYES GAVE HIM WARNING OF THE NECESSITY OF RECRUITING NATURE BY SLEEP AFTER ADMONISHING THE NONCOMMISSIONED GUARDIAN OF HARVEY TO OMIT NO WATCHFULNESS IN SECURING THE PRISONER
157-126796-0005 THE YOUTH WRAPPED HIMSELF IN HIS CLOAK AND STRETCHED ON A BENCH BEFORE A FIRE SOON FOUND THE REPOSE HE NEEDED A RUDE SHED EXTENDED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE REAR OF THE BUILDING
157-126796-0006 AND FROM OFF ONE OF ITS ENDS HAD BEEN PARTITIONED A SMALL APARTMENT
157-126796-0007 FOR MANY OF THE LESSER IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY THE LAWLESS TIMES HAD HOWEVER OCCASIONED ITS BEING STRIPPED OF EVERYTHING OF VALUE AND THE SEARCHING EYES OF BETTY FLANAGAN SELECTED THIS SPOT ON HER ARRIVAL
157-126796-0008 AND A SANCTUARY FOR HER PERSON THE SPARE ARMS AND BAGGAGE OF THE CORPS HAD ALSO BEEN DEPOSITED HERE AND THE UNITED TREASURES WERE PLACED UNDER THE EYE OF THE SENTINEL WHO PARADED THE SHED AS A GUARDIAN OF THE REAR OF THE HEADQUARTERS
157-126796-0009 A SECOND SOLDIER WHO WAS STATIONED NEAR THE HOUSE TO PROTECT THE HORSES OF THE OFFICERS COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE OUTSIDE OF THE APARTMENT AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT WINDOW OR OUTLET OF ANY KIND EXCEPTING ITS DOOR
157-126796-0010 THE CONSIDERATE SERGEANT THOUGHT THIS THE MOST BEFITTING PLACE IN WHICH TO DEPOSIT HIS PRISONER UNTIL THE MOMENT OF HIS EXECUTION SEVERAL INDUCEMENTS URGED SERGEANT HOLLISTER TO THIS DETERMINATION AMONG WHICH WAS THE ABSENCE
157-126796-0011 OF THE WASHERWOMAN WHO LAY BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE DREAMING THAT THE CORPS WAS ATTACKING A PARTY OF THE ENEMY
157-126796-0012 THAT PROCEEDED FROM HER OWN NOSE FOR THE BUGLES OF THE VIRGINIANS SOUNDING THE CHARGE ANOTHER WAS THE PECULIAR OPINIONS THAT THE VETERAN ENTERTAINED OF LIFE AND DEATH AND BY WHICH HE WAS DISTINGUISHED IN THE CORPS
157-126796-0013 AS A MAN OF MOST EXEMPLARY PIETY AND HOLINESS OF LIFE THE SERGEANT WAS MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND FOR HALF THAT PERIOD HE HAD BORNE ARMS
157-126796-0014 HAD PRODUCED AN EFFECT ON HIM DIFFERING GREATLY FROM THAT WHICH WAS THE USUAL MORAL CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH SCENES
157-126796-0015 CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD REWARDED HIS FIDELITY BY MAKING HIM ITS ORDERLY FOLLOWED BY BIRCH THE SERGEANT PROCEEDED IN SILENCE TO THE DOOR OF THE INTENDED PRISON AND THROWING IT OPEN WITH ONE HAND HE HELD A LANTERN WITH THE OTHER TO LIGHT THE PEDDLER TO HIS PRISON
157-126796-0016 SEATING HIMSELF ON A CASK THAT CONTAINED SOME OF BETTY'S FAVORITE BEVERAGE THE SERGEANT MOTIONED TO BIRCH TO OCCUPY ANOTHER IN THE SAME MANNER THE LANTERN WAS PLACED ON THE FLOOR WHEN THE DRAGOON AFTER LOOKING HIS PRISONER STEADILY IN THE FACE OBSERVED
157-126796-0017 YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WOULD MEET DEATH LIKE A MAN AND I HAVE BROUGHT YOU TO A SPOT WHERE YOU CAN TRANQUILLY ARRANGE YOUR THOUGHTS AND BE QUIET AND UNDISTURBED TIS A FEARFUL PLACE TO PREPARE FOR THE LAST CHANGE IN SAID HARVEY GAZING AROUND HIS LITTLE PRISON WITH A VACANT EYE
157-126796-0018 IN THE GREAT ACCOUNT WHERE A MAN PARADES HIS THOUGHTS FOR THE LAST REVIEW SO THAT HE FINDS THEM FIT TO PASS THE MUSTER OF ANOTHER WORLD I HAVE A SMALL BOOK HERE WHICH I MAKE IT A POINT TO READ A LITTLE IN WHENEVER WE ARE ABOUT TO ENGAGE
157-126796-0019 AND I FIND IT A GREAT STRENGTHENER IN TIME OF NEED WHILE SPEAKING HE TOOK A BIBLE FROM HIS POCKET AND OFFERED IT TO THE PEDDLER BIRCH RECEIVED THE VOLUME WITH HABITUAL REVERENCE BUT THERE WAS AN ABSTRACTED AIR ABOUT HIM AND A WANDERING OF THE EYE
157-126796-0020 THAT INDUCED HIS COMPANION TO THINK THAT ALARM WAS GETTING THE MASTERY OF THE PEDDLER'S FEELINGS ACCORDINGLY
157-126796-0021 IF ANYTHING LIES HEAVY ON YOUR MIND NOW IS THE BEST TIME TO GET RID OF IT
157-126796-0022 I PROMISE YOU ON THE WORD OF AN HONEST DRAGOON TO LEND YOU A HELPING HAND TO SEE THEM RIGHTED
157-126796-0023 ONE WOULD NOT WISH TO DIE WITH ANY VERY HEAVY SIN ON HIS CONSCIENCE AFTER ALL
157-126796-0024 THOROUGHLY EXAMINED THE PLACE IN WHICH HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT AND SAW NO MEANS OF ESCAPE
157-126796-0025 THE PEDDLER GAVE THE DRAGOON MORE OF HIS ATTENTION FIXING ON HIS SUNBURNED FEATURES SUCH SEARCHING LOOKS THAT SERGEANT HOLLISTER LOWERED HIS EYES BEFORE THE WILD EXPRESSION WHICH HE MET IN THE GAZE OF HIS PRISONER
157-126796-0026 WHY YES ALL THAT IS WELL ENOUGH RETURNED THE OTHER BUT JUSTICE SHOULD BE DONE WHILE THERE IS OPPORTUNITY THERE HAVE BEEN STIRRING TIMES IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE WAR BEGAN AND MANY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHTFUL GOODS
157-126796-0027 THESE HANDS SAID THE PEDDLER STRETCHING FORTH HIS MEAGER BONY FINGERS
157-126796-0028 AND NO DOUBT YOU NOW FEEL IT A GREAT CONSOLATION THERE ARE THREE GREAT SINS THAT IF A MAN CAN KEEP HIS CONSCIENCE CLEAR OF WHY BY THE MERCY OF GOD HE MAY HOPE TO PASS MUSTER WITH THE SAINTS IN HEAVEN
157-126796-0029 THEY ARE STEALING MURDERING AND DESERTION
157-126796-0030 OF SUCH A DEED YOU KNOW FALLS ON THE NATION AND A MAN RECEIVES HIS PUNISHMENT HERE WITH THE REST OF THE PEOPLE
157-126796-0031 I NEVER WAS A SOLDIER THEREFORE NEVER COULD DESERT SAID THE PEDDLER RESTING HIS FACE ON HIS HAND IN A MELANCHOLY ATTITUDE WHY DESERTION CONSISTS OF MORE THAN QUITTING YOUR COLORS THOUGH THAT IS CERTAINLY THE WORST KIND
157-126796-0032 A MAN MAY DESERT HIS COUNTRY IN THE HOUR OF NEED
157-126796-0033 BUT GOOD FEELINGS SOON GOT THE BETTER OF HIS ANTIPATHIES AND HE CONTINUED MORE MILDLY BUT STILL THAT IS A SIN WHICH I THINK MAY BE FORGIVEN IF SINCERELY REPENTED OF AND IT MATTERS BUT LITTLE
157-126796-0034 I RECOMMEND YOU TO SAY YOUR PRAYERS AND THEN TO GET SOME REST IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY DO BOTH THERE IS NO HOPE OF YOUR BEING PARDONED FOR COLONEL SINGLETON
157-126796-0035 NO NO NOTHING CAN SAVE YOU YOU SAY THE TRUTH CRIED BIRCH IT IS NOW TOO LATE I HAVE DESTROYED MY ONLY SAFEGUARD BUT HE WILL DO MY MEMORY JUSTICE AT LEAST WHAT SAFEGUARD ASKED THE SERGEANT WITH AWAKENED CURIOSITY
157-126796-0036 TIS NOTHING REPLIED THE PEDDLER
157-126796-0037 NOTHING AND NO ONE CAN AVAIL BUT LITTLE NOW SAID THE SERGEANT RISING TO GO LAY YOURSELF ON THE BLANKET OF MISSUS FLANAGAN AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP I WILL CALL YOU BETIMES IN THE MORNING
157-126796-0038 A MAN HUNG UP LIKE A DOG THEN YOU MIGHT SAVE ME FROM THIS IGNOMINIOUS DEATH SAID BIRCH SPRINGING TO HIS FEET AND CATCHING THE DRAGOON BY THE ARM AND OH WHAT WILL I NOT GIVE YOU IN REWARD
157-126796-0039 IN WHAT MANNER ASKED THE SERGEANT LOOKING AT HIM IN SURPRISE SEE SAID THE PEDDLER PRODUCING SEVERAL GUINEAS FROM HIS PERSON
157-126796-0040 WERE YOU THE MAN WHOSE PICTURE IS ON THE GOLD I WOULD NOT LISTEN TO SUCH A CRIME
157-126796-0041 GO GO POOR WRETCH AND MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH GOD FOR IT IS HE ONLY THAT CAN BE OF SERVICE TO YOU NOW THE SERGEANT TOOK UP THE LANTERN AND WITH SOME INDIGNATION IN HIS MANNER HE LEFT THE PEDDLER TO SORROWFUL MEDITATIONS ON HIS APPROACHING FATE
157-126796-0042 HOLLISTER CONCLUDED HIS INJUNCTIONS TO THE MAN IN THE SHED BY SAYING YOUR LIFE WILL DEPEND ON HIS NOT ESCAPING LET NONE ENTER OR QUIT THE ROOM TILL MORNING BUT SAID THE TROOPER MY ORDERS ARE TO LET THE WASHERWOMAN PASS IN AND OUT AS SHE PLEASES
157-126796-0043 WELL LET HER THEN BUT BE CAREFUL THAT THIS WILY PEDDLER DOES NOT GET OUT IN THE FOLDS OF HER PETTICOATS
157-126796-0044 UNTIL THE DRAGOON AT HIS DOOR HEARD HIS LOUD BREATHINGS
157-126796-0045 THE MAN CONTINUED WALKING HIS POST MUSING ON AN INDIFFERENCE TO LIFE WHICH COULD ALLOW NATURE ITS CUSTOMARY REST EVEN ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE GRAVE HARVEY BIRCH HAD HOWEVER BEEN A NAME TOO LONG HELD IN DETESTATION BY EVERY MAN IN THE CORPS
157-126796-0046 TO SUFFER ANY FEELINGS OF COMMISERATION TO MINGLE WITH THESE REFLECTIONS OF THE SENTINEL
157-126796-0047 THERE PROBABLY WAS NOT ANOTHER MAN OF HIS RANK IN THE WHOLE PARTY WHO WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED EQUAL BENEVOLENCE TO THE PRISONER OR WHO WOULD NOT HAVE IMITATED THE VETERAN IN REJECTING THE BRIBE ALTHOUGH PROBABLY FROM A LESS WORTHY MOTIVE
157-126796-0048 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF DISAPPOINTED VENGEANCE IN THE FEELINGS OF THE MAN WHO WATCHED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM ON FINDING HIS PRISONER ENJOYING A SLEEP OF WHICH HE HIMSELF WAS DEPRIVED AND AT HIS EXHIBITING SUCH OBVIOUS INDIFFERENCE TO THE UTMOST PENALTY THAT MILITARY RIGOR
157-126796-0049 COULD INFLICT ON ALL HIS TREASON TO THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY AND AMERICA MORE THAN ONCE HE FELT PROMPTED TO DISTURB THE REPOSE OF THE PEDDLER
157-126796-0050 HIS MEDITATIONS WERE HOWEVER SOON INTERRUPTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE WASHERWOMAN
157-126796-0051 MUTTERING EXECRATIONS AGAINST THE SERVANTS OF THE OFFICERS WHO BY THEIR WAGGERY HAD DISTURBED HER SLUMBERS BEFORE THE FIRE THE SENTINEL UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH OF HER MALEDICTIONS TO COMPREHEND THE CASE
157-126796-0052 AND HE SUFFERED HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITHOUT EXPLAINING THAT IT CONTAINED ANOTHER INMATE THE NOISE OF HER HUGE FRAME FALLING ON THE BED WAS SUCCEEDED
157-126796-0053 AS IF NO INTERRUPTION HAD OCCURRED THE RELIEF ARRIVED AT THIS MOMENT THE SENTINEL WHO FELT NETTLED AT THE CONTEMPT OF THE PEDDLER AFTER COMMUNICATING HIS ORDERS WHILE HE WAS RETIRING EXCLAIMED TO HIS SUCCESSOR
157-126796-0054 YOU MAY KEEP YOURSELF WARM BY DANCING JOHN THE PEDDLER SPY HAS TUNED HIS FIDDLE YOU HEAR AND IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE BETTY WILL STRIKE UP IN HER TURN THE JOKE WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENERAL LAUGH FROM THE PARTY WHO MARCHED ON IN PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTY
157-126796-0055 STAGGERING BACK AGAIN TOWARD HER FORMER QUARTERS STOP SAID THE SENTINEL CATCHING HER BY HER CLOTHES
157-126796-0056 CAN'T YOU HEAR THE RASCAL SNORING IN MY ROOM YOU DIRTY BLACKGUARD SPUTTERED BETTY HER WHOLE FRAME SHAKING WITH RAGE AND IS IT SO YE WOULD SARVE A
157-126796-0057 THAT A MAN MUST BE PUT TO SLEEP IN THE ROOM WID HER YE RAPSCALLION POOH DO YOU MIND A FELLOW WHO'S TO BE HANGED IN THE MORNING YOU SEE HE SLEEPS ALREADY TO MORROW HE'LL TAKE A LONGER NAP HANDS OFF YE VILLAIN CRIED THE WASHERWOMAN
157-126796-0058 RELINQUISHING A SMALL BOTTLE THAT THE TROOPER HAD SUCCEEDED IN WRESTING FROM HER BUT I'LL GO TO CAPTAIN JACK AND KNOW IF IT'S ORDERS TO PUT A HANG GALLOWS SPY IN MY ROOM AYE EVEN IN MY WIDOWED BED YOU TIEF
157-126796-0059 SAID THE FELLOW WITH A LAUGH TAKING THE BOTTLE FROM HIS MOUTH TO BREATHE OR YOU WILL WAKE THE GENTLEMAN WOULD YOU DISTURB A MAN IN HIS LAST SLEEP I'LL AWAKE CAPTAIN JACK YOU REPROBATE VILLAIN AND BRING HIM HERE TO SEE ME RIGHTED
157-126796-0060 HE WILL PUNISH YE ALL FOR IMPOSING ON A DACENT WIDOWED BODY YOU MARAUDER WITH THESE WORDS WHICH ONLY EXTORTED A LAUGH FROM THE SENTINEL BETTY STAGGERED ROUND THE END OF THE BUILDING AND MADE THE BEST OF HER WAY TOWARDS THE QUARTERS
157-126796-0061 OF HER FAVORITE CAPTAIN JOHN LAWTON IN SEARCH OF REDRESS
157-126796-0062 WHO TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE DIFFERENT SENTINELS
