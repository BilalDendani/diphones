3227-24784-0000 THAT THERE IS NO EMOTION DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO THIS LOVE WHEREBY THIS LOVE CAN BE DESTROYED THEREFORE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT THIS LOVE TOWARDS GOD IS THE MOST CONSTANT OF ALL THE EMOTIONS
3227-24784-0001 AND THAT IN SO FAR AS IT IS REFERRED TO THE BODY IT CANNOT BE DESTROYED UNLESS THE BODY BE DESTROYED ALSO AS TO ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS REFERRED TO THE MIND ONLY
3227-24784-0002 WITH THE EMOTION OF ANOTHER AND SEE THAT ONE MAN IS MORE TROUBLED THAN ANOTHER BY THE SAME EMOTION OR WHEN WE ARE COMPARING THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS OF THE SAME MAN ONE WITH ANOTHER
3227-24784-0003 POSSESSES OVER THE EMOTIONS IF IT DOES NOT ABSOLUTELY DESTROY THEM
3227-24784-0004 AT ANY RATE IT CAUSES THEM TO OCCUPY A VERY SMALL PART OF THE MIND
3227-24784-0005 FURTHER IT BEGETS A LOVE TOWARDS A THING IMMUTABLE AND ETERNAL
3227-24784-0006 NEITHER CAN IT BE DEFILED WITH THOSE FAULTS WHICH ARE INHERENT IN ORDINARY LOVE BUT IT MAY GROW FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH AND MAY ENGROSS THE GREATER PART OF THE MIND AND DEEPLY PENETRATE IT
3227-24784-0007 AND NOW I HAVE FINISHED WITH ALL THAT CONCERNS THIS PRESENT LIFE
