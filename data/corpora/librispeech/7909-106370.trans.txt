7909-106370-0000 AND STRAIGHTWAY THEY CEASED FROM SUCH WORDS AND GAVE UNWEARYING LABOUR TO THE OAR AND QUICKLY THEY PASSED BY THE SWIFTLY FLOWING RIVER RHEBAS AND THE PEAK OF COLONE
7909-106370-0001 AND BENEATH THE BREEZE THE ROPES AND ALL THE TACKLING QUIVERED AS THEY SPED ONWARD
7909-106370-0002 AND BENEATH IT SMOOTH ROCKS EVER WASHED BY THE SEA STAND ROOTED FIRM AND ROUND THEM THE WAVE ROLLS AND THUNDERS LOUD BUT ABOVE WIDE SPREADING PLANE TREES GROW ON THE TOPMOST POINT
7909-106370-0003 FROM HERE AN ICY BREATH UNCEASINGLY ISSUING FROM THE CHILL RECESS EVER FORMS A GLISTENING RIME WHICH MELTS AGAIN BENEATH THE MIDDAY SUN AND NEVER DOES SILENCE HOLD THAT GRIM HEADLAND
7909-106370-0004 BUT THERE IS A CONTINUAL MURMUR FROM THE SOUNDING SEA AND THE LEAVES THAT QUIVER IN THE WINDS FROM THE CAVE
7909-106370-0005 AND A HOLLOW RAVINE BRINGS IT DOWN FROM ABOVE
7909-106370-0006 AND HE MADE HIS OWN THE TRIBES OF THE BITHYNIANS AND THEIR LAND AS FAR AS THE MOUTH OF RHEBAS AND THE PEAK OF COLONE
7909-106370-0007 PAPHLAGONIANS OF PELOPS YIELDED JUST AS THEY WERE
7909-106370-0008 NEVERTHELESS BY YOUR HANDS HAVE THEY PAID THE PENALTY
7909-106370-0009 SUCH AS HE WAS WHEN HE WENT TO WAR AND ROUND HIS HEAD A FAIR HELM WITH FOUR PEAKS GLEAMED WITH ITS BLOOD RED CREST AND AGAIN HE ENTERED THE VAST GLOOM
7909-106370-0010 THENCE IT SPREADS INLAND OVER A HILLY COUNTRY STRAIGHT FORWARD WHEREFROM ITS STREAMS GO WINDING ON AND THEY ROLL ON THIS WAY AND THAT EVER MORE
