1313-136054-0000 I'M SO GLAD YOU'VE COME BACK SHE EXCLAIMED THE KANGAROO WAS A LITTLE BREATHLESS AND EXCITED
1313-136054-0001 SO WE MUST MOVE AND THAT WILL BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN STAYING WHERE WE ARE THEN LET US STAY SAID DOT THAT WON'T DO REPLIED THE KANGAROO THIS IS THE CONCLUSION I HAVE JUMPED TO IF WE STAY HERE THE BLACKS MIGHT COME THIS WAY AND THEIR DINGO DOGS HUNT US TO DEATH
1313-136054-0002 TO GET TO A SAFE PLACE WE MUST PASS THEIR CAMP THAT IS A LITTLE RISKY BUT WE MUST GO THAT WAY WE CAN DO THIS EASILY IF THE DOGS DON'T GET SCENT OF US AS ALL THE BLACKS ARE PRANCING ABOUT AND MAKING A NOISE HAVING A KIND OF GAME IN FACT
1313-136054-0003 AND THEY ARE SO AMUSED THAT WE OUGHT TO GET PAST QUITE SAFELY I'VE DONE IT MANY TIMES BEFORE AT NIGHT DOT LOOKED ROUND TO SAY GOOD BYE TO THE KOALA BUT THE LITTLE ANIMAL HAD HEARD THE KANGAROO SPEAK OF BLACKS AND THAT WORD SUGGESTED TO ITS EMPTY LITTLE HEAD
1313-136054-0004 THAT IT MUST KEEP ITS SKIN WHOLE SO WITHOUT WAITING TO BE POLITE TO DOT IT HAD SNEAKED UP ITS GUM TREE AND WAS WELL OUT OF SIGHT WITHOUT WASTING TIME DOT SETTLED IN THE KANGAROO'S POUCH AND THEY STARTED UPON THEIR PERILOUS WAY
1313-136054-0005 FOR SOME DISTANCE THE KANGAROO HOPPED ALONG BOLDLY WITH AN OCCASIONAL WARNING TO DOT TO SHUT HER EYES AS THEY PLUNGED THROUGH THE BUSHES BUT AFTER CROSSING A WATERCOURSE AND CLIMBING A STIFF HILL SHE WHISPERED THAT THEY MUST BOTH KEEP QUITE SILENT
1313-136054-0006 NO ANSWERED THE KANGAROO BECAUSE PAST THAT PLACE WE CAN REACH SOME VERY WILD COUNTRY
1313-136054-0007 AS CAUTIOUSLY AS WHEN THEY HAD VISITED THE WATER HOLE THE FIRST NIGHT
1313-136054-0008 AND THEY NEARED THE SCENE OF THE DANCE SOON SHE COULD HEAR THE STAMPING OF FEET THE BEATING OF WEAPONS TOGETHER AND THE WILD CHANTING AND SOMETIMES THERE WERE THE WHIMPERING OF DOGS AND THE CRY OF CHILDREN AT THE CAMP A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE CORROBOREE GROUND
1313-136054-0009 AND SHE KNEW THAT IN THAT PLACE THE TRIBE OF BLACK MEN WERE HAVING A FESTIVE DANCE IF THEY HAD GONE ON THEIR WAY IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SLIPPED PAST THE BLACKS WITHOUT DANGER BUT ALTHOUGH THE KANGAROO IS AS TIMID AN ANIMAL AS ANY IN THE BUSH IT IS ALSO VERY CURIOUS
1313-136054-0010 SHE WHISPERED TO DOT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE FOR A LITTLE HUMAN TO SEE SOME OTHER HUMANS AFTER BEING SO LONG AMONGST BUSH CREATURES AND SAID ALSO THAT THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DANGER IN HOPPING TO A ROCK THAT WOULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE OPEN GROUND WHERE THE CORROBOREE WAS BEING HELD
1313-136054-0011 OF COURSE DOT THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN SO THE KANGAROO TOOK HER TO THE ROCK WHERE THEY PEEPED THROUGH THE TREES AND SAW BEFORE THEM THE WEIRD SCENE AND DANCE DOT NEARLY SCREAMED WITH FRIGHT AT THE SIGHT SHE HAD THOUGHT SHE WOULD SEE A FEW BLACK FOLK
1313-136054-0012 NOT A CROWD OF SUCH TERRIBLE PEOPLE AS SHE BEHELD THEY DID NOT LOOK LIKE HUMAN BEINGS AT ALL BUT LIKE DREADFUL DEMONS THEY WERE SO WICKED AND UGLY IN APPEARANCE THE MEN WHO WERE DANCING WERE WITHOUT CLOTHES
1313-136054-0013 BUT THEIR BLACK BODIES WERE PAINTED WITH RED AND WHITE STRIPES AND BITS OF DOWN AND FEATHERS WERE STUCK ON THEIR SKIN SOME HAD ONLY WHITE STRIPES OVER THE PLACES WHERE THEIR BONES WERE WHICH MADE THEM LOOK LIKE SKELETONS FLITTING BEFORE THE FIRE OR IN AND OUT OF THE SURROUNDING DARKNESS
1313-136054-0014 THE DANCING MEN WERE DIVIDED FROM THE REST OF THE TRIBE BY A ROW OF FIRES WHICH BURNING BRIGHTLY LIT THE HORRID SCENE WITH A LURID RED LIGHT THE FIRELIGHT SEEMED TO MAKE THE FEROCIOUS FACES OF THE TRIBE STILL MORE HIDEOUS
1313-136054-0015 THE TRIBE PEOPLE WERE SQUATTING IN ROWS ON THE GROUND BEATING BOOMERANGS AND SPEARS TOGETHER OR STRIKING BAGS OF SKIN WITH STICKS TO MAKE AN ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE WAILING SONG THEY SANG SOMETIMES THE WOMEN WOULD CEASE BEATING THE SKIN BAGS TO CLAP THEIR HANDS AND STRIKE THEIR SIDES
1313-136054-0016 YELLING THE WORDS OF THE CORROBOREE SONG AS THE PAINTED FIGURES LIKE FIENDS AND SKELETONS DANCED BEFORE THE ROW OF FIRES IT WAS A TERRIFYING SIGHT TO DOT OH KANGAROO SHE WHISPERED THEY ARE DREADFUL HORRID CREATURES
1313-136054-0017 THEY'RE JUST HUMANS REPLIED THE KANGAROO INDULGENTLY BUT WHITE HUMANS ARE NOT LIKE THAT SAID DOT ALL HUMANS ARE THE SAME UNDERNEATH THEY ALL KILL KANGAROOS SAID THE KANGAROO LOOK THERE THEY ARE PLAYING AT KILLING US IN THEIR DANCE
1313-136054-0018 ONE OF THE BLACKFELLOWS HAD COME FROM A LITTLE BOWER OF TREES AND WORE A FEW SKINS SO ARRANGED AS TO MAKE HIM LOOK AS MUCH LIKE A KANGAROO AS POSSIBLE WHILST HE WORKED A STICK WHICH HE PRETENDED WAS A KANGAROO'S TAIL AND HOPPED ABOUT
1313-136054-0019 THE OTHER PAINTED SAVAGES WERE CREEPING IN AND OUT OF THE BUSHES WITH THEIR SPEARS AND BOOMERANGS AS IF THEY WERE HUNTING AND THE DRESSED UP KANGAROO MADE BELIEVE NOT TO SEE THEM BUT STOOPED DOWN NIBBLING GRASS WHAT AN IDEA OF A KANGAROO SNIFFED DOT'S FRIEND
1313-136054-0020 AND HAVE BOUNDED AWAY FAR OUT OF SIGHT BY NOW BUT IT'S ALL SHAM SAID DOT THE BLACK MAN COULDN'T BE A REAL KANGAROO THEN IT JUST SHOWS HOW STUPID HUMANS ARE TO TRY AND BE ONE SAID HER FRIEND HUMANS THINK THEMSELVES SO CLEVER SHE CONTINUED
1313-136054-0021 BUT JUST SEE WHAT BAD KANGAROOS THEY MAKE SUCH A SIMPLE THING TO DO TOO BUT THEIR LEGS BEND THE WRONG WAY FOR JUMPING AND THAT STICK ISN'T ANY GOOD FOR A TAIL
1313-136054-0022 JUST SEE TOO HOW THOSE SKINS FIT WHY IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE A KANGAROO'S SIDES SPLIT WITH LAUGHTER TO SEE SUCH FOOLERY
1313-136054-0023 THE FELLOW TRIED TO ACT THE PART OF A WHITE MAN ALTHOUGH HE HAD NO MORE CLOTHES ON THAN THE OLD HAT AND RAGS BUT AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF DANCING HE STRUTTED ABOUT PULLED UP THE RAG COLLAR MADE A GREAT FUSS WITH HIS RAG CUFFS
1313-136054-0024 AND KEPT TAKING OFF HIS OLD STRAW HAT TO THE OTHER BLACKFELLOWS AND TO THE REST OF THE TRIBE WHO KEPT UP THE NOISE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRES NOW THIS IS BETTER SAID THE KANGAROO WITH A SMILE IT'S VERY SILLY
1313-136054-0025 BLACK HUMANS CAN ACT BEING WHITE HUMANS BUT THEY ARE OF NO GOOD AS KANGAROOS DOT THOUGHT THAT IF MEN BEHAVED LIKE THAT IN TOWNS IT MUST BE VERY STRANGE SHE HAD NOT SEEN ANY LIKE THE ACTING BLACKFELLOW AT HER COTTAGE HOME
1313-136054-0026 AND WILLY WAGTAILS HAD A VERY POOR OPINION OF WHITE PEOPLE
1313-136054-0027 BUT ALL THE SAME SHE SOMETIMES WISHED SHE COULD BE A NOBLE KANGAROO AND NOT A DESPISED HUMAN BEING I WISH I WERE NOT A LITTLE WHITE GIRL SHE WHISPERED TO THE KANGAROO THE GENTLE ANIMAL PATTED HER KINDLY WITH HER DELICATE BLACK HANDS
1313-136054-0028 YOU ARE AS NICE NOW AS MY BABY KANGAROO SHE SAID SADLY BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO GROW INTO A REAL WHITE HUMAN FOR SOME REASON THERE HAVE TO BE ALL SORTS OF CREATURES ON THE EARTH THERE ARE HAWKS SNAKES DINGOES AND HUMANS AND NO ONE CAN TELL FOR WHAT GOOD THEY EXIST
1313-136054-0029 THEY MUST HAVE DROPPED ON TO THIS WORLD BY MISTAKE FOR ANOTHER WHERE THERE COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN THEMSELVES AFTER ALL SAID THE KIND ANIMAL IT WOULDN'T DO FOR EVERY ONE TO BE A KANGAROO FOR I DOUBT IF THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH GRASS BUT YOU MAY BECOME AN IMPROVED HUMAN HOW COULD I BE THAT
1313-136054-0030 ASKED DOT EAGERLY NEVER WEAR KANGAROO LEATHER BOOTS NEVER USE KANGAROO SKIN RUGS AND HERE IT HESITATED A LITTLE
1313-136054-0031 NEVER DO WHAT ENQUIRED DOT ANXIOUS TO KNOW ALL THAT SHE SHOULD DO SO AS TO BE IMPROVED NEVER NEVER EAT KANGAROO TAIL SOUP
1313-136054-0032 I WILL BE AN IMPROVED HUMAN
1313-136054-0033 THAT THEY HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE PERILOUSNESS OF THEIR POSITION PERHAPS THIS WAS BECAUSE THE KANGAROO CANNOT THINK BUT IT QUICKLY JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WERE IN DANGER WHILST THEY HAD BEEN PEEPING AT THE CORROBOREE AND TALKING
1313-136054-0034 THE DINGO DOGS THAT HAD BEEN PROWLING AROUND THE CAMP HAD CAUGHT SCENT OF THE KANGAROO AND FOLLOWING THE TRAIL HAD SET UP AN ANGRY SNAPPING AND HOWLING
