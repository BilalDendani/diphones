2004-147173-0000 THIRTY ONE HOW MARY PASSED THE NIGHT TO THINK THAT ALL THIS LONG INTERMINABLE NIGHT WHICH I HAVE PASSED IN THINKING ON TWO WORDS GUILTY'
2004-147173-0001 LIKE ONE HAPPY MOMENT O'ER MANY A HEAD HATH FLOWN UNHEEDED BY
2004-147173-0002 OR FAR HAPPIER STILL WITH DEEP BREATH BURIED IN FORGETFULNESS O ALL THE DISMALLEST IMAGES OF DEATH DID SWIM BEFORE MY EYES WILSON AND NOW WHERE WAS MARY
2004-147173-0003 HOW JOB'S HEART WOULD HAVE BEEN RELIEVED OF ONE OF ITS CARES IF HE COULD HAVE SEEN HER FOR HE WAS IN A MISERABLE STATE OF ANXIETY ABOUT HER AND MANY AND MANY A TIME THROUGH THAT LONG NIGHT HE SCOLDED HER AND HIMSELF HER FOR HER OBSTINACY
2004-147173-0004 AND HIMSELF FOR HIS WEAKNESS IN YIELDING TO HER OBSTINACY WHEN SHE INSISTED ON BEING THE ONE TO FOLLOW AND FIND OUT WILL SHE DID NOT PASS THAT NIGHT IN BED ANY MORE THAN JOB BUT SHE WAS UNDER A RESPECTABLE ROOF AND AMONG KIND THOUGH ROUGH PEOPLE
2004-147173-0005 SHE HAD OFFERED NO RESISTANCE TO THE OLD BOATMAN WHEN HE HAD CLUTCHED HER ARM IN ORDER TO INSURE HER FOLLOWING HIM AS HE THREADED THE CROWDED DOCK WAYS AND DIVED UP STRANGE BYE STREETS SHE CAME ON MEEKLY AFTER HIM
2004-147173-0006 SCARCELY THINKING IN HER STUPOR WHERE SHE WAS GOING AND GLAD IN A DEAD HEAVY WAY THAT SOME ONE WAS DECIDING THINGS FOR HER HE LED HER TO AN OLD FASHIONED HOUSE ALMOST AS SMALL AS HOUSE COULD BE WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT LONG AGO
2004-147173-0007 BEFORE ALL THE OTHER PART OF THE STREET AND HAD A COUNTRY TOWN LOOK ABOUT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT BUSTLING BACK STREET HE PULLED HER INTO THE HOUSE PLACE AND RELIEVED TO A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HIS FEAR OF LOSING HER ON THE WAY HE EXCLAIMED THERE
2004-147173-0008 GIVING A GREAT SLAP OF ONE HAND ON HER BACK THE ROOM WAS LIGHT AND BRIGHT AND ROUSED MARY PERHAPS THE SLAP ON HER BACK MIGHT HELP A LITTLE TOO AND SHE FELT THE AWKWARDNESS OF ACCOUNTING FOR HER PRESENCE TO A LITTLE BUSTLING OLD WOMAN
2004-147173-0009 WHO HAD BEEN MOVING ABOUT THE FIRE PLACE ON HER ENTRANCE THE BOATMAN TOOK IT VERY QUIETLY NEVER DEIGNING TO GIVE ANY EXPLANATION BUT SITTING DOWN IN HIS OWN PARTICULAR CHAIR AND CHEWING TOBACCO WHILE HE LOOKED AT MARY WITH THE MOST SATISFIED AIR IMAGINABLE HALF TRIUMPHANTLY
2004-147173-0010 THE GIRL'S CHEEK FLUSHED AND THEN BLANCHED TO A DEAD WHITENESS A FILM CAME OVER HER EYES AND CATCHING AT THE DRESSER FOR SUPPORT IN THAT HOT WHIRLING ROOM SHE FELL IN A HEAP ON THE FLOOR
2004-147173-0011 BOTH MAN AND WIFE CAME QUICKLY TO HER ASSISTANCE THEY RAISED HER UP STILL INSENSIBLE AND HE SUPPORTED HER ON ONE KNEE WHILE HIS WIFE PATTERED AWAY FOR SOME COLD FRESH WATER SHE THREW IT STRAIGHT OVER MARY
2004-147173-0012 BUT THOUGH IT CAUSED A GREAT SOB THE EYES STILL REMAINED CLOSED AND THE FACE AS PALE AS ASHES WHO IS SHE BEN ASKED THE WOMAN AS SHE RUBBED HER UNRESISTING POWERLESS HANDS
2004-147173-0013 HOW SHOULD I KNOW ANSWERED HER HUSBAND GRUFFLY WELL A WELL IN A SOOTHING TONE SUCH AS YOU USE TO IRRITATED CHILDREN AND AS IF HALF TO HERSELF I ONLY THOUGHT YOU MIGHT YOU KNOW

2004-147173-0015 HERE YOU HOLD HER UP A BIT SAID HER HUSBAND SHE DID AS HE DESIRED STILL CROONING TO HERSELF NOT CARING FOR HIS SHORT SHARP INTERRUPTIONS AS SHE WENT ON AND INDEED TO HER OLD LOVING HEART HIS CROSSEST WORDS
2004-147173-0016 FELL LIKE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS FOR HE HAD BEEN THE HUSBAND OF HER YOUTH AND EVEN HE ROUGH AND CRABBED AS HE WAS WAS SECRETLY SOOTHED BY THE SOUND OF HER VOICE ALTHOUGH NOT FOR WORLDS IF HE COULD HAVE HELPED IT
2004-147173-0017 WOULD HE HAVE SHOWN ANY OF THE LOVE THAT WAS HIDDEN BENEATH HIS ROUGH OUTSIDE WHAT'S THE OLD FELLOW AFTER SAID SHE BENDING OVER MARY SO AS TO ACCOMMODATE THE DROOPING HEAD

2004-147173-0019 AS HE PRODUCED A SQUARE BOTTLE OF SMUGGLED SPIRITS LABELLED GOLDEN WASSER FROM A CORNER CUPBOARD IN THEIR LITTLE ROOM THAT'LL DO SAID SHE AS THE DOSE HE POURED INTO MARY'S OPEN MOUTH MADE HER START AND COUGH
2004-147173-0020 I'M SURE SIR I DON'T KNOW RIGHTLY HOW TO THANK YOU FALTERED MARY SOFTLY FORTH BE HANGED TO YOU AND YOUR THANKS AND HE SHOOK HIMSELF TOOK HIS PIPE AND WENT OUT WITHOUT DEIGNING ANOTHER WORD LEAVING HIS WIFE SORELY PUZZLED AS TO THE CHARACTER AND HISTORY
2004-147173-0021 OF THE STRANGER WITHIN HER DOORS MARY WATCHED THE BOATMAN LEAVE THE HOUSE AND THEN TURNING HER SORROWFUL EYES TO THE FACE OF HER HOSTESS SHE ATTEMPTED FEEBLY TO RISE WITH THE INTENTION OF GOING AWAY WHERE SHE KNEW NOT
2004-147173-0022 NAY NAY WHO E'ER THOU BE'ST THOU'RT NOT FIT TO GO OUT INTO THE STREET PERHAPS SINKING HER VOICE A LITTLE THOU'RT A BAD ONE I ALMOST MISDOUBT THEE THOU'RT SO PRETTY

2004-147173-0026 THERE WAS A MAN IN IT AS MIGHT SAVE A LIFE AT THE TRIAL TO MORROW THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT LET HIM COME BUT HE SAYS HE'LL COME BACK IN THE PILOT BOAT SHE FELL TO SOBBING AT THE THOUGHT OF HER WANING HOPES AND THE OLD WOMAN TRIED TO COMFORT HER BEGINNING WITH HER ACCUSTOMED
2004-147173-0027 AND ONLY DRANK A CUP OF TEA WITH THIRSTY EAGERNESS FOR THE SPIRITS HAD THROWN HER INTO A BURNING HEAT AND RENDERED EACH IMPRESSION RECEIVED THROUGH HER SENSES OF THE MOST PAINFUL DISTINCTNESS AND INTENSITY WHILE HER HEAD ACHED IN A TERRIBLE MANNER
2004-147173-0028 SHE DISLIKED SPEAKING HER POWER OVER HER WORDS SEEMED SO UTTERLY GONE SHE USED QUITE DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS TO THOSE SHE INTENDED SO SHE KEPT SILENT WHILE MISSUS STURGIS FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF HER HOSTESS TALKED AWAY AND PUT HER TEA THINGS BY
2004-147173-0029 AND MOVED ABOUT INCESSANTLY IN A MANNER THAT INCREASED THE DIZZINESS IN MARY'S HEAD SHE FELT AS IF SHE OUGHT TO TAKE LEAVE FOR THE NIGHT AND GO BUT WHERE PRESENTLY THE OLD MAN CAME BACK CROSSER AND GRUFFER THAN WHEN HE WENT AWAY
2004-147173-0030 HE KICKED ASIDE THE DRY SHOES HIS WIFE HAD PREPARED FOR HIM AND SNARLED AT ALL SHE SAID MARY ATTRIBUTED THIS TO HIS FINDING HER STILL THERE AND GATHERED UP HER STRENGTH FOR AN EFFORT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE BUT SHE WAS MISTAKEN BY AND BYE

2004-147173-0032 AND AS SHE WAS A SAILOR'S WIFE SHE INSTANTLY RECOGNISED THE UNFAVOURABLE POINT AT WHICH THE INDICATOR SEEMED STATIONARY AND GIVING A HEAVY SIGH TURNED INTO THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO BEAT ABOUT IN HER OWN MIND FOR SOME OTHER MODE OF COMFORT
