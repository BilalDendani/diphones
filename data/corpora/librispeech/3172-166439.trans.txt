3172-166439-0000 A HALF MILE ON HIGH AND ALL OF TWO THOUSAND FEET ACROSS RAN THE CIRCULAR LIP OF ITS VAST RIM ABOVE IT WAS A CIRCLE OF WHITE AND GLARING SKY IN WHOSE CENTER FLAMED THE SUN AND INSTANTLY
3172-166439-0001 BEFORE MY VISION COULD GRASP A TITHE OF THAT PANORAMA I KNEW THAT THIS PLACE WAS THE VERY HEART OF THE CITY ITS VITAL GANGLION ITS SOUL AROUND THE CRATER LIP WERE POISED THOUSANDS OF CONCAVE DISKS VERNAL GREEN
3172-166439-0002 ENORMOUS THEY WERE LIKE A BORDER OF GIGANTIC UPTHRUST SHIELDS AND WITHIN EACH EMBLAZONED LIKE A SHIELD'S DEVICE WAS A BLINDING FLOWER OF FLAME THE REFLECTED DILATED FACE OF THE SUN BELOW THIS DIADEM
3172-166439-0003 HUNG PENDENT CLUSTERS OF OTHER DISKS SWARMED LIKE THE GLOBULAR HIVING OF THE CONSTELLATION HERCULES CAPTURED STARS AND EACH OF THESE PRISONED THE IMAGE OF OUR SUN A HUNDRED FEET BELOW US WAS THE CRATER FLOOR UP FROM IT
3172-166439-0004 THRUST A MOUNTAINOUS FOREST OF THE PALLIDLY RADIANT CONES BRISTLING PRODIGIOUS TIER UPON TIER THICKET UPON THICKET PHALANX UPON PHALANX THEY CLIMBED UP AND UP PYRAMIDICALLY THEY FLUNG THEIR SPIKED HOSTS
3172-166439-0005 THEY DREW TOGETHER TWO THOUSAND FEET ABOVE US CLUSTERING CLOSE ABOUT THE FOOT OF A SINGLE HUGE SPIRE WHICH THRUST ITSELF SKYWARD ABOVE THEM THE CREST OF THIS SPIRE WAS TRUNCATED FROM ITS SHORN TIP RADIATED SCORES OF LONG AND SLENDER SPOKES
3172-166439-0006 HOLDING IN PLACE A THOUSAND FEET WIDE WHEEL OF WAN GREEN DISKS WHOSE CONCAVE SURFACES UNLIKE THOSE SMOOTH ONES GIRDING THE CRATER WERE CURIOUSLY FACETED THIS AMAZING STRUCTURE RESTED UPON A MYRIAD FOOTED BASE OF CRYSTAL
3172-166439-0007 BUT IT WAS IN SIZE TO THAT AS AS LEVIATHAN TO A MINNOW FROM IT STREAMED THE SAME BAFFLING SUGGESTION OF INVINCIBLE FORCE TRANSMUTED INTO MATTER ENERGY COALESCED INTO THE TANGIBLE POWER MADE CONCENTRATE IN THE VESTMENTS OF SUBSTANCE
3172-166439-0008 HALF WAY BETWEEN CRATER LIP AND FLOOR BEGAN THE HORDES OF THE METAL PEOPLE IN COLOSSAL ANIMATE CHEVEAU DE FRISE OF HUNDRED FOOT GIRDERS THEY THRUST THEMSELVES OUT FROM THE CURVING WALLS WALLS I KNEW
3172-166439-0009 AS ALIVE AS THEY FROM THESE BROBDIGNAGIAN BEAMS THEY SWUNG IN ROPES AND CLUSTERS SPHERES AND CUBES STUDDED AS THICKLY WITH THE PYRAMIDS AS EVER TITAN'S MACE WITH SPIKES GROUP AFTER BIZARRE GROUP THEY DROPPED PENDULOUS
3172-166439-0010 COPPICES OF SLENDER COLUMNS OF THISTLED GLOBES SPRANG UP TO MEET THE FESTOONED JOISTS BETWEEN THE GIRDERS THEY DRAPED THEMSELVES IN LONG STELLATED GARLANDS GROUPED THEMSELVES IN INNUMERABLE KALEIDOSCOPIC PATTERNS
3172-166439-0011 THEY CLICKED INTO PLACE AROUND THE GOLDEN TURRET IN WHICH WE CROUCHED IN FANTASTIC ARRASES THEY SWAYED IN FRONT OF US NOW HIDING BY NOW REVEALING THROUGH THEIR QUICKSILVER INTERWEAVINGS THE MOUNTS OF THE CONES
3172-166439-0012 AND STEADILY THOSE FLOWING IN BELOW ADDED TO THEIR MULTITUDES GLIDING UP CABLE AND PILLAR BUILDING OUT STILL FURTHER THE LIVING GIRDERS STRINGING THEMSELVES UPON LIVING FESTOON AND LIVING GARLAND WEAVING IN AMONG THEM
3172-166439-0013 CHANGING THEIR SHAPES REWRITING THEIR SYMBOLS THEY SWUNG AND THREADED SWIFTLY IN SHIFTING ARABESQUE IN GOTHIC TRACERIES IN LACE LIKE FANTASIES UTTERLY BIZARRE
3172-166439-0014 CRYSTALLINE GEOMETRIC ALWAYS ABRUPTLY THEIR MOVEMENT CEASED SO ABRUPTLY THAT THE STOPPAGE OF ALL THE ORDERED TURMOIL HAD THE QUALITY OF APPALLING SILENCE
3172-166439-0015 AN UNIMAGINABLE TAPESTRY BEDIGHT WITH INCREDIBLE BROIDERY THE METAL PEOPLE DRAPED THE VAST CUP PILLARED IT AS THOUGH IT WERE A TEMPLE GARNISHED IT WITH THEIR BODIES AS THOUGH IT WERE A SHRINE ACROSS THE FLOOR TOWARD THE CONES
3172-166439-0016 IN SHAPE ONLY A GLOBE LIKE ALL ITS KIND YET IT WAS INVESTED WITH POWER IT RADIATED POWER AS A STAR DOES LIGHT WAS CLOTHED IN UNSEEN GARMENTS OF SUPERNAL FORCE IN ITS WAKE DRIFTED TWO GREAT PYRAMIDS
3172-166439-0017 AFTER THEM TEN SPHERES BUT LITTLE SMALLER THAN THE SHAPE WHICH LED
3172-166439-0018 ON THEY SWEPT UNTIL THEY REACHED THE BASE OF THE CONES THEY PAUSED AT THE EDGE OF THE CRYSTAL TABLING THEY TURNED THERE WAS A FLASHING AS OF A METEOR BURSTING THE GLOBE HAD OPENED INTO THAT SPLENDOR OF JEWEL FIRES
3172-166439-0019 BEFORE WHICH HAD FLOATED NORHALA AND RUTH I SAW AGAIN THE LUMINOUS OVALS OF SAPPHIRE STUDDING ITS GOLDEN ZONE THE MYSTIC ROSE OF PULSING PETAL FLAME THE STILL CORE OF INCANDESCENT RUBY THAT WAS THE HEART OF THAT ROSE
3172-166439-0020 STRANGELY I FELT MY OWN HEART VEER TOWARD THIS THING BOWING BEFORE ITS BEAUTY AND ITS STRENGTH ALMOST WORSHIPING A SHOCK OF REVULSION WENT THROUGH ME I SHOT A QUICK HALF FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT DRAKE
3172-166439-0021 HE WAS CROUCHING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE LIP OF THE LEDGE HANDS CLASPED AND KNUCKLES WHITE WITH THE INTENSITY OF HIS GRIP EYES RAPT STARING UPON THE VERGE OF WORSHIP EVEN AS I HAD BEEN DRAKE
3172-166439-0022 I THRUST MY ELBOW INTO HIS SIDE BRUTALLY NONE OF THAT REMEMBER YOU'RE HUMAN GUARD YOURSELF MAN GUARD YOURSELF WHAT HE MUTTERED THEN ABRUPTLY HOW DID YOU KNOW I FELT IT MYSELF I ANSWERED
3172-166439-0023 FOR GOD'S SAKE DICK HOLD FAST TO YOURSELF REMEMBER RUTH HE SHOOK HIS HEAD VIOLENTLY AS THOUGH TO BE RID OF SOME CLINGING CLOYING THING I'LL NOT FORGET AGAIN HE SAID
3172-166439-0024 HE HUDDLED DOWN ONCE MORE CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF PEERING OVER NO ONE OF THE METAL PEOPLE HAD MOVED THE SILENCE THE STILLNESS WAS UNBROKEN NOW THE FLANKING PYRAMIDS SHOT FORTH INTO TWIN STARS
3172-166439-0025 BLAZING WITH VIOLET LUMINESCENCES AND ONE BY ONE AFTER THEM THE TEN LESSER SPHERES EXPANDED INTO FLAMING ORBS BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE BUT FAR LESS GLORIOUS THAN THAT DISK OF WHOM THEY WERE THE COUNSELORS MINISTERS WHAT
3172-166439-0026 THERE CAME A LITTLE WAILING FAR AWAY IT WAS AND FAR NEARER IT DREW WAS THAT A TREMOR THAT PASSED THROUGH THE CROWDED CRATER A QUICK PULSE OF EAGERNESS HUNGRY
3172-166439-0027 WHISPERED DRAKE THEY'RE HUNGRY CLOSER WAS THE WAILING AGAIN THAT FAINT TREMOR QUIVERED OVER THE PLACE AND NOW I CAUGHT IT A QUICK AND AVID PULSING HUNGRY
3172-166439-0028 WHISPERED DRAKE AGAIN LIKE A LOT OF LIONS WITH THE KEEPER COMING ALONG WITH MEAT THE WAILING WAS BELOW US I FELT NOT A QUIVER THIS TIME BUT AN UNMISTAKABLE SHOCK PASS THROUGH THE HORDE IT THROBBED AND PASSED
3172-166439-0029 INTO THE FIELD OF OUR VISION UP TO THE FLAMING DISK RUSHED AN IMMENSE CUBE THRICE THE HEIGHT OF A TALL MAN AS I THINK I HAVE NOTED BEFORE WHEN IT UNFOLDED ITS RADIANCE WAS THAT SHAPE OF MINGLED BEAUTY AND POWER
3172-166439-0030 I CALL THE METAL EMPEROR YET THIS THING ECLIPSED IT BLACK UNCOMPROMISING IN SOME INDEFINABLE WAY BRUTAL ITS SQUARE BULK BLOTTED OUT THE DISK'S EFFULGENCE SHROUDED IT
3172-166439-0031 AND A SHADOW SEEMED TO FALL UPON THE CRATER THE VIOLET FIRES OF THE FLANKING STARS PULSED OUT WATCHFULLY THREATENINGLY FOR ONLY AN INSTANT THE DARKENING BLOCK LOOMED AGAINST THE DISK BLACKENED IT
3172-166439-0032 THERE CAME ANOTHER METEOR BURST OF LIGHT WHERE THE CUBE HAD BEEN WAS NOW A TREMENDOUS FIERY CROSS A CROSS INVERTED ITS UPPER ARM AROSE TO TWICE THE LENGTH EITHER OF ITS HORIZONTALS OR THE SQUARE THAT WAS ITS FOOT
3172-166439-0033 IN ITS OPENING IT MUST HAVE TURNED FOR ITS FACE WAS TOWARD US AND AWAY FROM THE CONES ITS BODY HID THE DISK AND ALMOST ALL THE SURFACES OF THE TWO WATCHFUL STARS
3172-166439-0034 EIGHTY FEET AT LEAST IN HEIGHT THIS CRUCIFORM SHAPE STOOD IT FLAMED AND FLICKERED WITH ANGRY SMOKY CRIMSONS AND SCARLETS WITH SULLEN ORANGE GLOWINGS AND GLITTERINGS OF SULPHUROUS YELLOWS
3172-166439-0035 NO TRACE OF THE PULSING MYSTIC ROSE NO SHADOW OF JUBILANT SAPPHIRE NO PURPLE ROYAL NO TENDER MERCIFUL GREENS NOR GRACIOUS OPALESCENCES NOTHING EVEN OF THE BLASTING VIOLET OF THE STARS
3172-166439-0036 ALL ANGRY SMOKY REDS AND OCHRES THE CROSS BLAZED FORTH
3172-166439-0037 SOMETHING REAL SOMETHING CRUEL SOMETHING NEARER TO EARTH CLOSER TO MAN THE KEEPER OF THE CONES AND THE METAL EMPEROR MUTTERED DRAKE I BEGIN TO GET IT YES I BEGIN TO GET VENTNOR
3172-166439-0038 ONCE MORE THE PULSE THE AVID THROBBING SHOOK THE CRATER
3172-166439-0039 THE SILENCE THE KEEPER TURNED I SAW ITS PALELY LUSTROUS BLUE METALLIC BACK I DREW OUT MY LITTLE FIELD GLASSES FOCUSSED THEM THE CROSS SLIPPED SIDEWISE PAST THE DISK ITS COURTIERS ITS STELLATED GUARDIANS
3172-166439-0040 AS IT WENT BY THEY SWUNG ABOUT WITH IT EVER FACING IT AND NOW AT LAST WAS CLEAR A THING THAT HAD PUZZLED GREATLY THE MECHANISM OF THAT OPENING PROCESS BY WHICH SPHERE BECAME OVAL DISK
3172-166439-0041 PYRAMID A FOUR POINTED STAR AND AS I HAD GLIMPSED IN THE PLAY OF THE LITTLE THINGS ABOUT NORHALA COULD SEE NOW SO PLAINLY IN THE KEEPER THE BLOCKS TOOK THIS INVERTED CRUCIFORM SHAPE THE METAL PEOPLE
3172-166439-0042 WERE HOLLOW HOLLOW METAL BOXES IN THEIR ENCLOSING SIDES DWELT ALL THEIR VITALITY THEIR POWERS THEMSELVES AND THOSE SIDES WERE EVERYTHING THAT THEY WERE
3172-166439-0043 FOLDED THE OVAL DISK BECAME THE SPHERE THE FOUR POINTS OF THE STAR THE SQUARE FROM WHICH THOSE POINTS RADIATED SHUTTING BECAME THE PYRAMID THE SIX FACES OF THE CUBES WERE WHEN OPENED THE INVERTED CROSS
3172-166439-0044 NOR WERE THESE FLEXIBLE MOBILE WALLS MASSIVE THEY WERE INDEED CONSIDERING THE APPARENT MASS OF THE METAL FOLK MOST ASTONISHINGLY FRAGILE THOSE OF THE KEEPER DESPITE ITS EIGHTY FEET OF HEIGHT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN A YARD IN THICKNESS
3172-166439-0045 AT THE EDGES I THOUGHT I COULD SEE GROOVINGS NOTED THE SAME APPEARANCES AT THE OUTLINES OF THE STARS SEEN SIDEWISE THE BODY OF THE METAL EMPEROR SHOWED AS A CONVEXITY ITS SURFACE SMOOTH WITH A SUGGESTION OF TRANSPARENCY
3172-166439-0046 WAS THIS MOUNTAIN OF CONES THEN ACTUALLY A SHRINE AN IDOL OF THE METAL PEOPLE THEIR GOD THE OBLONG THAT WAS THE UPPER HALF OF THE CRUCIFORM SHAPE EXTENDED NOW AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE HORIZONTAL ARMS
3172-166439-0047 IT HOVERED A RECTANGLE FORTY FEET LONG AS MANY FEET OVER THE FLOOR AT THE BASE OF THE CRYSTAL PEDESTAL IT BENT AGAIN THIS TIME FROM THE HINGE THAT HELD THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TO THE BASE AND NOW IT WAS A HUGE TRUNCATED CROSS
3172-166439-0048 A T SHAPED FIGURE HOVERING ONLY TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE PAVE DOWN FROM THE KEEPER
3172-166439-0049 SERPENTINE WHIPLIKE SILVERY WHITE THEY WERE DYED WITH THE SCARLET AND ORANGE FLAMING OF THE SURFACE NOW HIDDEN FROM MY EYES REFLECTED THOSE SULLEN AND ANGRY GLEAMINGS VERMICEOUS COILING
3172-166439-0050 THEY SEEMED TO DROP FROM EVERY INCH OF THE OVERHANGING PLANES SOMETHING THERE WAS BENEATH THEM SOMETHING LIKE AN IMMENSE AND LUMINOUS TABLET THE TENTACLES WERE MOVING OVER IT PRESSING HERE THRUSTING THERE
3172-166439-0051 TURNING PUSHING MANIPULATING A SHUDDERING PASSED THROUGH THE CROWDING CONES I SAW THE TREMOR SHAKE THEIR BRISTLING HOSTS OSCILLATE THE GREAT SPIRE SET THE FACETED DISKS QUIVERING THE TREMBLING GREW
3172-166439-0052 A VIBRATION IN EVERY SEPARATE CONE THAT BECAME EVEN MORE RAPID THERE WAS A FAINT CURIOUSLY OPPRESSIVE HUMMING LIKE THE DISTANT ECHO OF A TEMPEST IN CHAOS FASTER EVER FASTER GREW THE VIBRATION
3172-166439-0053 NOW THE SHARP OUTLINES OF THE CONES WERE DISSOLVING AND NOW THEY WERE GONE THE MOUNT OF THE CONES HAD BECOME A MIGHTY PYRAMID OF PALE GREEN RADIANCE ONE TREMENDOUS PALLID FLAME OF WHICH THE SPIRE WAS THE TONGUE
3172-166439-0054 OUT FROM THE DISKED WHEEL AT ITS SHORN TIP GUSHED A FLOOD OF LIGHT LIGHT THAT GATHERED ITSELF FROM THE LEAPING RADIANCE BELOW IT THE TENTACLES OF THE KEEPER MOVED MORE SWIFTLY OVER THE ENIGMATIC TABLET
3172-166439-0055 WRITHING CLOUDILY CONFUSEDLY RAPID THE FACETED DISKS WAVERED TURNED UPWARD THE WHEEL BEGAN TO WHIRL FASTER FASTER UP FROM THAT FLAMING CIRCLE OUT INTO THE SKY
3172-166439-0056 LEAPED A THICK PALE GREEN COLUMN OF INTENSEST LIGHT WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED AS COMPACT AS WATER CONCENTRATE IT STRUCK STRAIGHT OUT TOWARD THE FACE OF THE SUN IT THRUST UP WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT
3172-166439-0057 THE SPEED OF LIGHT A THOUGHT CAME TO ME INCREDIBLE I BELIEVED IT EVEN AS I REACTED TO IT MY PULSE IS UNIFORMLY SEVENTY TO THE MINUTE I SOUGHT MY WRIST FOUND THE ARTERY
3172-166439-0058 MADE ALLOWANCE FOR ITS POSSIBLE ACCELERATION BEGAN TO COUNT WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED DRAKE TAKE MY GLASSES I MUTTERED TRYING TO KEEP UP WHILE SPEAKING MY TALLY MATCHES IN MY POCKET SMOKE THE LENSES I WANT TO LOOK AT SUN
3172-166439-0059 WITH A LOOK OF STUPEFIED AMAZEMENT WHICH AT ANOTHER TIME I WOULD HAVE FOUND LAUGHABLE HE OBEYED HOLD THEM TO MY EYES I ORDERED THREE MINUTES HAD GONE BY THERE IT WAS
3172-166439-0060 THAT FOR WHICH I SOUGHT CLEAR THROUGH THE DARKENED LENSES I COULD SEE THE SUN SPOT HIGH UP ON THE NORTHERN MOST LIMB OF THE SUN
3172-166439-0061 AN UNTHINKABLY HUGE DYNAMO POURING ITS FLOODS OF ELECTRO MAGNETISM UPON ALL THE CIRCLING PLANETS THAT SOLAR CRATER WHICH WE NOW KNOW WAS WHEN AT ITS MAXIMUM ALL OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MILES ACROSS
3172-166439-0062 THE GREAT SUN SPOT OF THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN NINETEEN THE MOST ENORMOUS EVER RECORDED BY ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE FIVE MINUTES HAD GONE BY COMMON SENSE WHISPERED TO ME THERE WAS NO USE KEEPING MY EYES FIXED TO THE GLASSES
3172-166439-0063 EVEN IF THAT THOUGHT WERE TRUE EVEN IF THAT PILLAR OF RADIANCE WERE A MESSENGER AN EARTH HURLED BOLT FLYING TO THE SUN THROUGH ATMOSPHERE AND OUTER SPACE WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT EVEN IF IT WERE THIS STUPENDOUS CREATION OF THESE THINGS STILL
3172-166439-0064 BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE MINUTES MUST ELAPSE BEFORE IT COULD REACH THE ORB AND AS MANY MINUTES MUST GO BY BEFORE THE IMAGE OF WHATEVER ITS IMPACT MIGHT PRODUCE UPON THE SUN COULD PASS BACK OVER THE BRIDGE OF LIGHT SPANNING THE NINETY MILLIONS OF MILES BETWEEN IT AND US AND AFTER ALL
3172-166439-0065 DID NOT THAT HYPOTHESIS BELONG TO THE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE EVEN WERE IT SO WHAT WAS IT THAT THE METAL MONSTER EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THIS RADIANT SHAFT COLOSSAL AS IT WAS TO US
3172-166439-0066 WHAT POSSIBLE EFFECT COULD THAT SPEAR HAVE UPON THE SOLAR FORCES AND YET AND YET A GNAT'S BITE CAN DRIVE AN ELEPHANT MAD AND NATURE'S BALANCE IS DELICATE
3172-166439-0067 AND WHAT GREAT HAPPENINGS MAY FOLLOW THE SLIGHTEST DISTURBANCE OF HER INFINITELY SENSITIVE HER COMPLEX EQUILIBRIUM IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE EIGHT MINUTES HAD PASSED TAKE THE GLASSES I BADE DRAKE
3172-166439-0068 LOOK UP AT THE SUN SPOT THE BIG ONE I SEE IT HE HAD OBEYED ME WHAT OF IT NINE MINUTES THE SHAFT IF I WERE RIGHT HAD BY NOW TOUCHED THE SUN WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW
3172-166439-0069 I DON'T GET YOU AT ALL SAID DRAKE AND LOWERED THE GLASSES TEN MINUTES
3172-166439-0070 GASPED DRAKE I PEERED DOWN THEN ALMOST FORGOT TO COUNT
3172-166439-0071 WAS SHRUNKEN THE PILLAR OF RADIANCE HAD NOT LESSENED BUT THE MECHANISM THAT WAS ITS SOURCE HAD RETREATED WHOLE YARDS WITHIN THE FIELD OF ITS CRYSTAL BASE AND THE METAL EMPEROR DULLED AND FAINT WERE HIS FIRES DIMMED HIS SPLENDORS
3172-166439-0072 AND FAINTER STILL WERE THE VIOLET LUMINESCENCES OF THE WATCHING STARS THE SHIMMERING LIVERY OF HIS COURT THE KEEPER OF THE CONES WERE NOT ITS OUTSTRETCHED PLANES HOVERING LOWER AND LOWER OVER THE GLEAMING TABLET ITS TENTACLES MOVING AIMLESSLY FEEBLY
3172-166439-0073 I HAD A SENSE OF FORCE BEING WITHDRAWN FROM ALL ABOUT ME IT WAS AS THOUGH ALL THE CITY WERE BEING DRAINED OF LIFE AS THOUGH VITALITY WERE BEING SUCKED FROM IT TO FEED THIS PYRAMID OF RADIANCE
3172-166439-0074 DRAINED FROM IT TO FORGE THE THRUSTING SPEAR PIERCING SUNWARD THE METAL PEOPLE SEEMED TO HANG LIMPLY INERT THE LIVING GIRDERS SEEMED TO SAG THE LIVING COLUMNS TO BEND TO DROOP AND TO SWAY
3172-166439-0075 TWELVE MINUTES WITH A NERVE RACKING CRASH ONE OF THE LADEN BEAMS FELL DRAGGING DOWN WITH IT OTHERS BENDING SHATTERING IN ITS FALL A THICKET OF THE HORNED COLUMNS BEHIND US
3172-166439-0076 DYING SOMETHING OF THAT HELLISH LONELINESS THAT DEMONIAC DESIRE FOR IMMOLATION THAT HAD ASSAILED US IN THE HAUNTED HOLLOW OF THE RUINS BEGAN TO CREEP OVER ME THE CROWDED CRATER WAS FAINTING THE LIFE WAS GOING OUT OF THE CITY
3172-166439-0077 ITS MAGNETIC LIFE DRAINING INTO THE SHAFT OF GREEN FIRE DULLER GREW THE METAL EMPEROR'S GLORIES FOURTEEN MINUTES GOODWIN CRIED DRAKE THE LIFE'S GOING OUT OF THESE THINGS
3172-166439-0078 GOING OUT WITH THAT RAY THEY'RE SHOOTING FIFTEEN MINUTES I WATCHED THE TENTACLES OF THE KEEPER GROPE OVER THE TABLET ABRUPTLY THE FLAMING PYRAMID DARKENED WENT OUT
3172-166439-0079 THE RADIANT PILLAR HURTLED UPWARD LIKE A THUNDER BOLT VANISHED IN SPACE BEFORE US STOOD THE MOUNT OF CONES SHRUNKEN TO A SIXTH OF ITS FORMER SIZE SIXTEEN MINUTES ALL ABOUT THE CRATER LIP
3172-166439-0080 THE RINGED SHIELDS TILTED THRUST THEMSELVES ON HIGH AS THOUGH BEHIND EACH WAS AN EAGER LIFTING ARM BELOW THEM THE HIVED CLUSTERS OF DISKS CHANGED FROM GLOBULES INTO WIDE CORONETS
3172-166439-0081 SEVENTEEN MINUTES I DROPPED MY WRIST SEIZED THE GLASSES FROM DRAKE RAISED THEM TO THE SUN FOR A MOMENT I SAW NOTHING THEN A TINY SPOT OF WHITE
3172-166439-0082 INCANDESCENCE SHONE FORTH AT THE LOWER EDGE OF THE GREAT SPOT IT GREW INTO A POINT OF RADIANCE DAZZLING EVEN THROUGH THE SHADOWED LENSES I RUBBED MY EYES LOOKED AGAIN IT WAS STILL THERE LARGER
3172-166439-0083 BLAZING WITH AN EVER INCREASING AND INTOLERABLE INTENSITY I HANDED THE GLASSES TO DRAKE SILENTLY I SEE IT HE MUTTERED I SEE IT AND THAT DID IT THAT GOODWIN
3172-166439-0084 GOODWIN THE SPOT IT'S WIDENING IT'S WIDENING I SNATCHED THE GLASSES FROM HIM I CAUGHT AGAIN THE DAZZLING FLASHING
3172-166439-0085 CHANGE TO THIS DAY I DO NOT KNOW
3172-166439-0086 PERHAPS IT WAS NOT IT MAY BE THAT UNDER THAT FINGER OF FORCE THAT SPEAR OF LIGHT THAT WOUND IN THE SIDE OF OUR SUN HAD OPENED FURTHER THAT THE SUN HAD WINCED I DO NOT TO THIS DAY KNOW BUT WHETHER IT HAD OR NOT
3172-166439-0087 STILL SHONE THE INTOLERABLY BRILLIANT LIGHT AND MIRACLE ENOUGH THAT WAS FOR ME TWENTY MINUTES SUBCONSCIOUSLY I HAD GONE ON COUNTING TWENTY MINUTES ABOUT THE CRATERED GIRDLE OF THE UPTHRUST SHIELDS
3172-166439-0088 A GLIMMERING MISTINESS WAS GATHERING A TRANSLUCENT MIST BERYL PALE AND BERYL CLEAR IN A HEART BEAT IT HAD THICKENED INTO A VAST AND VAPOROUS RING THROUGH WHOSE SWARMS OF CORPUSCLES THE SUN'S REFLECTED IMAGE
3172-166439-0089 UPON EACH DISK SHONE CLEAR AS THOUGH SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF TRANSPARENT ATOMS OF AQUAMARINE AGAIN THE FILAMENTS OF THE KEEPER MOVED FEEBLY
3172-166439-0090 BRILLIANT EVER MORE BRILLIANT WAXED THE FAST THICKENING MISTS ABRUPTLY AND AGAIN AS ONE THE DISKS BEGAN TO REVOLVE FROM EVERY CONCAVE SURFACE
3172-166439-0091 FROM THE SURFACES OF THE HUGE CIRCLETS BELOW THEM FLASHED OUT A STREAM OF GREEN FIRE GREEN AS THE FIRE OF GREEN LIFE ITSELF CORPUSCULAR SPUN OF UNCOUNTED RUSHING DAZZLING IONS
3172-166439-0092 THE GREAT RAYS STRUCK ACROSS IMPINGED UPON THE THOUSAND FOOT WHEEL THAT CROWNED THE CONES SET IT WHIRLING OVER IT I SAW FORM A LIMPID CLOUD OF THE BRILLIANT VAPORS WHENCE CAME THESE SPARKLING NEBULOSITIES
3172-166439-0093 THESE MISTS OF LIGHT IT WAS AS THOUGH THE CLUSTERED SPINNING DISKS REACHED INTO THE SHADOWLESS AIR SUCKED FROM IT SOME UNSEEN RHYTHMIC ENERGY AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO THIS VISIBLE CORUSCATING FLOOD FOR NOW IT WAS A FLOOD
3172-166439-0094 DOWN FROM THE IMMENSE WHEEL CAME POURING CATARACTS OF GREEN FIRES THEY CASCADED OVER THE CONES DELUGED THEM ENGULFED THEM BENEATH THAT RADIANT INUNDATION THE CONES GREW PERCEPTIBLY THEIR VOLUME INCREASED
3172-166439-0095 AS THOUGH THEY GORGED THEMSELVES UPON THE LIGHT NO IT WAS AS THOUGH THE CORPUSCLES FLEW TO THEM COALESCED AND BUILT THEMSELVES INTO THE STRUCTURE OUT AND FURTHER OUT UPON THE BASE OF CRYSTAL THEY CREPT AND HIGHER AND HIGHER SOARED THEIR TIPS
3172-166439-0096 THRUSTING EVER THRUSTING UPWARD TOWARD THE WHIRLING WHEEL THAT FED THEM
3172-166439-0097 UNCOILING EAGERLY AVIDLY THROUGH THE TWENTY FEET OF SPACE BETWEEN THEIR SOURCE AND THE ENIGMATIC MECHANISM THEY MANIPULATED THE CRATER'S DISKS TILTED DOWNWARD INTO THE VAST HOLLOW SHOT THEIR JETS OF GREEN RADIANCE
3172-166439-0098 DRENCHING THE METAL HORDES SPLASHING FROM THE POLISHED WALLS WHEREVER THE METAL HORDES HAD LEFT THOSE LIVING WALLS EXPOSED ALL ABOUT US WAS A TREMBLING AN ACCELERATING PULSE OF LIFE COLOSSAL
3172-166439-0099 RHYTHMIC EVER QUICKER EVER MORE POWERFULLY THAT PULSE THROBBED A PRODIGIOUS VIBRATION MONSTROUSLY ALIVE FEEDING WHISPERED DRAKE FEEDING FEEDING ON THE SUN
3172-166439-0100 FASTER DANCED THE RADIANT BEAMS THE CRATER WAS A CAULDRON OF GREEN FIRES THROUGH WHICH THE CONICAL RAYS ANGLED AND INTERWOVE CROSSED AND MINGLED AND WHERE THEY MINGLED WHERE THEY CROSSED FLAMED OUT SUDDENLY IMMENSE RAYLESS ORBS
3172-166439-0101 PALPITANT FOR AN INSTANT THEN DISSOLVING IN SPIRALLING FEATHERY SPRAY OF PALLID EMERALD INCANDESCENCES STRONGER AND STRONGER BEAT THE PULSE OF RETURNING LIFE A JETTING STREAM STRUCK SQUARELY UPON THE METAL EMPEROR
3172-166439-0102 OUT BLAZED HIS SPLENDORS JUBILANT HIS GOLDEN ZODIAC NO LONGER TARNISHED AND DULL RAN WITH SUN FLAMES THE WONDROUS ROSE WAS A RACING LAMBENT MIRACLE UP SNAPPED THE KEEPER TOWERED BEHIND HIM
3172-166439-0103 ALL FLICKERING SCARLETS AND LEAPING YELLOWS NO LONGER WRATHFUL OR SULLEN THE PLACE DRIPPED RADIANCE WAS FILLING LIKE A CHRISOM WITH RADIANCE US TOO THE SPARKLING MISTS BATHED
3172-166439-0104 I WAS CONSCIOUS OF A CURIOUSLY WILD EXHILARATION A QUICKENING OF THE PULSE AN ABNORMALLY RAPID BREATHING I STOOPED TO TOUCH DRAKE SPARKS LEAPED FROM MY OUTSTRETCHED FINGERS GREAT GREEN SPARKS
3172-166439-0105 THAT CRACKLED AS THEY IMPACTED UPON HIM HE GAVE THEM NO HEED BUT STARED WITH FASCINATED EYES UPON THE CRATER NOW FROM EVERY SIDE BROKE A TEMPEST OF GEM FIRES FROM EVERY GIRDER AND COLUMN
3172-166439-0106 FROM EVERY ARRAS PENDENT AND LOOPING BURST DIAMOND GLITTERINGS RUBY LUMINESCENCES LANCED FLAMES OF MOLTEN EMERALD AND SAPPHIRES FLASHINGS OF AMETHYST AND OPAL METEORIC IRIDESCENCES
3172-166439-0107 DAZZLING SPECTRUMS THE HOLLOW WAS A CAVE OF SOME ALADDIN OF THE TITANS ABLAZE WITH ENCHANTED HOARDS
3172-166439-0108 GEMS IN WHICH IMPRISONED HOSTS OF THE JINNS OF LIGHT BEAT SPARKLING AGAINST THEIR CRYSTAL WALLS TO ESCAPE I THRUST THE FANTASIES FROM ME FANTASTIC ENOUGH WAS THIS REALITY GLOBE AND PYRAMID
3172-166439-0109 AND CUBE OF THE METAL PEOPLE OPENING WIDE BATHING IN DRINKING FROM THE RADIANT MAELSTROM THAT FASTER AND EVER FASTER SWIRLED ABOUT THEM FEEDING IT WAS DRAKE'S AWED VOICE
3172-166439-0110 THE CIRCLING SHIELDS WERE RAISING THEMSELVES LIFTING THEMSELVES HIGHER ABOVE THE CRATER LIP INTO THE CROWDED CYLINDER CAME NOW ONLY THE RAYS FROM THE HIGH CIRCLETS THE STREAMS FROM THE HUGE WHEEL ABOVE THE STILL GROWING CONES
3172-166439-0111 UP AND UP THE SHIELDS ROSE BUT BY WHAT MECHANISM RAISED I COULD NOT SEE THEIR MOTION CEASED IN ALL THEIR THOUSANDS THEY TURNED OVER THE CITY'S TOP AND OUT INTO THE OVAL VALLEY THEY POURED THEIR TORRENTS OF LIGHT
3172-166439-0112 FLOODING IT DELUGING IT EVEN AS THEY HAD THIS PIT THAT WAS THE CITY'S HEART FEEDING I KNEW THOSE OTHER METAL HORDES WITHOUT AND AS THOUGH IN ANSWER SWEEPING DOWN UPON US THROUGH THE CIRCLES OF OPEN SKY
3172-166439-0113 A CLAMOR POURED IF WE'D BUT KNOWN DRAKE'S VOICE CAME TO ME THIN AND UNREAL THROUGH THE TUMULT IT'S WHAT VENTNOR MEANT IF WE HAD GOT DOWN THERE WHEN THEY WERE SO WEAK
3172-166439-0114 IF WE COULD HAVE HANDLED THE KEEPER WE COULD HAVE SMASHED THAT PLATE THAT WORKS THE CONES WE COULD HAVE KILLED THEM THERE ARE OTHER CONES I CRIED BACK TO HIM NO HE SHOOK HIS HEAD THIS IS THE MASTER MACHINE IT'S WHAT VENTNOR MEANT
3172-166439-0115 WHEN HE SAID TO STRIKE THROUGH THE SUN AND WE'VE LOST THE CHANCE LOUDER GREW THE HURRICANE WITHOUT AND NOW WITHIN BEGAN ITS MATE THROUGH THE MISTS FLASHED LINKED TEMPESTS OF LIGHTNINGS BOLT UPON JAVELIN BOLT AND EVER MORE THICKLY
3172-166439-0116 LIGHTNINGS GREEN AS THE MISTS THEMSELVES LIGHTNING BOLTS OF DESTROYING VIOLETS SEARING SCARLETS TEARING CHAINS OF WITHERING YELLOWS GLOBES OF EXPLODING MULTICOLORED ELECTRIC INCANDESCENCES
3172-166439-0117 THE CRATER WAS THREADED WITH THE LIGHTNINGS OF THE METAL PEOPLE WAS BROIDERED WITH THEM WAS A PIT WOVEN WITH VAST AND CHANGING PATTERNS OF ELECTRIC FLAME WHAT WAS IT THAT DRAKE HAD SAID
3172-166439-0118 DESTROYED THEM THINGS THAT COULD THRUST THEIR WILL AND POWER UP THROUGH NINETY MILLION MILES OF SPACE AND SUCK FROM THE SUN THE HONEY OF POWER
