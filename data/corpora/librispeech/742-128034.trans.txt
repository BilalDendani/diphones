742-128034-0000 BETWEEN JAMES AND PENN THERE HAD LONG BEEN A FAMILIAR ACQUAINTANCE THE QUAKER NOW BECAME A COURTIER AND ALMOST A FAVOURITE HE WAS EVERY DAY SUMMONED FROM THE GALLERY INTO THE CLOSET
742-128034-0001 AND SOMETIMES HAD LONG AUDIENCES WHILE PEERS WERE KEPT WAITING IN THE ANTECHAMBERS IT WAS NOISED ABROAD THAT HE HAD MORE REAL POWER TO HELP AND HURT THAN MANY NOBLES WHO FILLED HIGH OFFICES
742-128034-0002 HE WAS LOUDLY ACCUSED OF BEING A PAPIST NAY A JESUIT SOME AFFIRMED THAT HE HAD BEEN EDUCATED AT SAINT OMERS AND OTHERS THAT HE HAD BEEN ORDAINED AT ROME
742-128034-0003 THESE CALUMNIES INDEED COULD FIND CREDIT ONLY WITH THE UNDISCERNING MULTITUDE BUT WITH THESE CALUMNIES WERE MINGLED ACCUSATIONS MUCH BETTER FOUNDED
742-128034-0004 TO SPEAK THE WHOLE TRUTH CONCERNING PENN IS A TASK WHICH REQUIRES SOME COURAGE FOR HE IS RATHER A MYTHICAL THAN A HISTORICAL PERSON RIVAL NATIONS AND HOSTILE SECTS HAVE AGREED IN CANONISING HIM
742-128034-0005 ENGLAND IS PROUD OF HIS NAME A GREAT COMMONWEALTH BEYOND THE ATLANTIC REGARDS HIM WITH A REVERENCE SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH THE ATHENIANS FELT FOR THESEUS AND THE ROMANS FOR QUIRINUS
742-128034-0006 THE RESPECTABLE SOCIETY OF WHICH HE WAS A MEMBER HONOURS HIM AS AN APOSTLE BY PIOUS MEN OF OTHER PERSUASIONS HE IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS A BRIGHT PATTERN OF CHRISTIAN VIRTUE
742-128034-0007 MEANWHILE ADMIRERS OF A VERY DIFFERENT SORT HAVE SOUNDED HIS PRAISES THE FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PARDONED WHAT THEY REGARDED AS HIS SUPERSTITIOUS FANCIES
742-128034-0008 IN CONSIDERATION OF HIS CONTEMPT FOR PRIESTS AND OF HIS COSMOPOLITAN BENEVOLENCE IMPARTIALLY EXTENDED TO ALL RACES AND TO ALL CREEDS HIS NAME HAS THUS BECOME
742-128034-0009 THROUGHOUT ALL CIVILISED COUNTRIES A SYNONYME FOR PROBITY AND PHILANTHROPY NOR IS THIS HIGH REPUTATION ALTOGETHER UNMERITED PENN WAS WITHOUT DOUBT A MAN OF EMINENT VIRTUES
742-128034-0010 HE HAD A STRONG SENSE OF RELIGIOUS DUTY AND A FERVENT DESIRE TO PROMOTE THE HAPPINESS OF MANKIND ON ONE OR TWO POINTS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE HE HAD NOTIONS MORE CORRECT THAN WERE IN HIS DAY
742-128034-0011 COMMON EVEN AMONG MEN OF ENLARGED MINDS AND AS THE PROPRIETOR AND LEGISLATOR OF A PROVINCE WHICH BEING ALMOST UNINHABITED WHEN IT CAME INTO HIS POSSESSION AFFORDED A CLEAR FIELD FOR MORAL EXPERIMENTS
742-128034-0012 HE HAD THE RARE GOOD FORTUNE OF BEING ABLE TO CARRY HIS THEORIES INTO PRACTICE WITHOUT ANY COMPROMISE AND YET WITHOUT ANY SHOCK TO EXISTING INSTITUTIONS HE WILL ALWAYS BE MENTIONED WITH HONOUR AS A FOUNDER OF A COLONY
742-128034-0013 WHO DID NOT IN HIS DEALINGS WITH A SAVAGE PEOPLE ABUSE THE STRENGTH DERIVED FROM CIVILISATION AND AS A LAWGIVER WHO IN AN AGE OF PERSECUTION MADE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY THE CORNERSTONE OF A POLITY
742-128034-0014 BUT HIS WRITINGS AND HIS LIFE FURNISH ABUNDANT PROOFS THAT HE WAS NOT A MAN OF STRONG SENSE HE HAD NO SKILL IN READING THE CHARACTERS OF OTHERS
742-128034-0015 HIS CONFIDENCE IN PERSONS LESS VIRTUOUS THAN HIMSELF LED HIM INTO GREAT ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR ONE GREAT PRINCIPLE SOMETIMES IMPELLED HIM TO VIOLATE OTHER GREAT PRINCIPLES
742-128034-0016 WHICH HE OUGHT TO HAVE HELD SACRED NOR WAS HIS RECTITUDE ALTOGETHER PROOF AGAINST THE TEMPTATIONS TO WHICH IT WAS EXPOSED IN THAT SPLENDID AND POLITE BUT DEEPLY CORRUPTED SOCIETY
742-128034-0017 THE WHOLE COURT WAS IN A FERMENT WITH INTRIGUES OF GALLANTRY AND INTRIGUES OF AMBITION THE TRAFFIC IN HONOURS PLACES AND PARDONS WAS INCESSANT
742-128034-0018 AND WHO WAS KNOWN TO HAVE FREE ACCESS TO MAJESTY SHOULD BE FREQUENTLY IMPORTUNED TO USE HIS INFLUENCE FOR PURPOSES WHICH A RIGID MORALITY MUST CONDEMN THE INTEGRITY OF PENN HAD STOOD FIRM AGAINST OBLOQUY AND PERSECUTION
742-128034-0019 BUT NOW ATTACKED BY ROYAL SMILES BY FEMALE BLANDISHMENTS BY THE INSINUATING ELOQUENCE AND DELICATE FLATTERY OF VETERAN DIPLOMATISTS AND COURTIERS HIS RESOLUTION BEGAN TO GIVE WAY
742-128034-0020 TITLES AND PHRASES AGAINST WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BORNE HIS TESTIMONY DROPPED OCCASIONALLY FROM HIS LIPS AND HIS PEN IT WOULD BE WELL IF HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF NOTHING WORSE THAN SUCH COMPLIANCES
742-128034-0021 WITH THE FASHIONS OF THE WORLD UNHAPPILY IT CANNOT BE CONCEALED THAT HE BORE A CHIEF PART IN SOME TRANSACTIONS CONDEMNED NOT MERELY BY THE RIGID CODE OF THE SOCIETY TO WHICH HE BELONGED BUT BY THE GENERAL SENSE OF ALL HONEST MEN
742-128034-0022 HE AFTERWARDS SOLEMNLY PROTESTED THAT HIS HANDS WERE PURE FROM ILLICIT GAIN AND THAT HE HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY GRATUITY FROM THOSE WHOM HE HAD
742-128034-0023 IN SOME UNJUSTIFIABLE TRANSACTIONS OF WHICH OTHERS ENJOYED THE PROFITS THE FIRST USE WHICH HE MADE OF HIS CREDIT WAS HIGHLY COMMENDABLE
742-128034-0024 HE STRONGLY REPRESENTED THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS BRETHREN TO THE NEW KING WHO SAW WITH PLEASURE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GRANT INDULGENCE TO THESE QUIET SECTARIES AND TO THE ROMAN CATHOLICS WITHOUT SHOWING SIMILAR FAVOUR TO OTHER CLASSES
742-128034-0025 WHICH WERE THEN UNDER PERSECUTION A LIST WAS FRAMED OF PRISONERS AGAINST WHOM PROCEEDINGS HAD BEEN INSTITUTED FOR NOT TAKING THE OATHS OR FOR NOT GOING TO CHURCH
742-128034-0026 AND OF WHOSE LOYALTY CERTIFICATES HAD BEEN PRODUCED TO THE GOVERNMENT THESE PERSONS WERE DISCHARGED AND ORDERS WERE GIVEN THAT NO SIMILAR PROCEEDING SHOULD BE INSTITUTED TILL THE ROYAL PLEASURE SHOULD BE FURTHER SIGNIFIED
742-128034-0027 IN THIS WAY ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED QUAKERS AND A STILL GREATER NUMBER OF ROMAN CATHOLICS
742-128034-0028 WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT THERE WAS MUCH DOUBT WHETHER THEIR CHAMBER AS IT WAS THEN FITTED UP WOULD AFFORD SUFFICIENT ACCOMMODATION FOR THEM THEY EMPLOYED THE DAYS WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED THE OPENING OF THE SESSION
742-128034-0029 IN TALKING OVER PUBLIC AFFAIRS WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE AGENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT A GREAT MEETING OF THE LOYAL PARTY WAS HELD AT THE FOUNTAIN TAVERN IN THE STRAND AND ROGER LESTRANGE WHO HAD RECENTLY BEEN KNIGHTED BY THE KING
742-128034-0030 AND RETURNED TO PARLIAMENT BY THE CITY OF WINCHESTER
742-128034-0031 THE TORY COUNTRY GENTLEMEN WERE WITH SCARCELY ONE EXCEPTION DESIROUS TO MAINTAIN THE TEST ACT AND THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT AND SOME AMONG THEM TALKED OF VOTING THE REVENUE ONLY FOR A TERM OF YEARS
742-128034-0032 BUT THEY WERE PERFECTLY READY TO ENACT SEVERE LAWS AGAINST THE WHIGS AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE SEEN ALL THE SUPPORTERS OF THE EXCLUSION BILL MADE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING OFFICE
742-128034-0033 A REVENUE FOR LIFE THE ADMISSION OF ROMAN CATHOLICS TO OFFICE AND THE REPEAL OF THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT ON THESE THREE OBJECTS HIS HEART WAS SET
742-128034-0034 AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS DISPOSED TO ACCEPT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THEM A PENAL LAW AGAINST EXCLUSIONISTS SUCH A LAW INDEED WOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY UNPLEASING TO HIM
742-128034-0035 FOR ONE CLASS OF EXCLUSIONISTS STOOD HIGH IN HIS FAVOUR THAT CLASS OF WHICH SUNDERLAND WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT CLASS WHICH HAD JOINED THE WHIGS IN THE DAYS OF THE PLOT MERELY BECAUSE THE WHIGS WERE PREDOMINANT
742-128034-0036 AND WHICH HAD CHANGED WITH THE CHANGE OF FORTUNE JAMES JUSTLY REGARDED THESE RENEGADES AS THE MOST SERVICEABLE TOOLS THAT HE COULD EMPLOY IT WAS NOT FROM THE STOUTHEARTED CAVALIERS
742-128034-0037 WHO HAD BEEN TRUE TO HIM IN HIS ADVERSITY THAT HE COULD EXPECT ABJECT AND UNSCRUPULOUS OBEDIENCE IN HIS PROSPERITY THE MEN WHO IMPELLED NOT BY ZEAL FOR LIBERTY OR FOR RELIGION
742-128034-0038 IN WHICH HE SHOWED A GENEROUS COMPASSION TO THOSE WHO HAD OPPOSED HIM HONESTLY AND ON PUBLIC GROUNDS BUT HE FREQUENTLY SPARED AND PROMOTED THOSE WHOM SOME VILE MOTIVE HAD INDUCED TO INJURE HIM
742-128034-0039 FOR THAT MEANNESS WHICH MARKED THEM OUT AS FIT IMPLEMENTS OF TYRANNY WAS SO PRECIOUS IN HIS ESTIMATION THAT HE REGARDED IT WITH SOME INDULGENCE EVEN WHEN IT WAS EXHIBITED AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
742-128034-0040 THE KING'S WISHES WERE COMMUNICATED THROUGH SEVERAL CHANNELS TO THE TORY MEMBERS OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE MAJORITY WAS EASILY PERSUADED TO FOREGO ALL THOUGHTS OF A PENAL LAW AGAINST THE EXCLUSIONISTS
742-128034-0041 THAT GREAT PARTY WHICH IN THE LAST THREE PARLIAMENTS HAD BEEN PREDOMINANT HAD NOW DWINDLED TO A PITIABLE MINORITY AND WAS INDEED LITTLE MORE THAN A FIFTEENTH PART OF THE HOUSE
742-128034-0042 OF THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN KNIGHTS AND BURGESSES
742-128034-0043 IT IS EVIDENT THAT A BODY OF MEN SO RAW AND INEXPERIENCED MUST HAVE BEEN IN SOME IMPORTANT QUALITIES
742-128034-0044 TO TWO PEERS OF THE KINGDOM OF SCOTLAND ONE OF THEM CHARLES MIDDLETON EARL OF MIDDLETON
742-128034-0045 HAD SHORTLY BEFORE THE DEATH OF THE LATE KING BEEN SWORN OF THE ENGLISH PRIVY COUNCIL AND APPOINTED ONE OF THE SECRETARIES OF STATE
742-128034-0046 WHO HAD LONG HELD THE POST OF ENVOY AT VERSAILLES THE FIRST BUSINESS OF THE COMMONS WAS TO ELECT A SPEAKER WHO SHOULD BE THE MAN WAS A QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN MUCH DEBATED IN THE CABINET
742-128034-0047 GUILDFORD HAD RECOMMENDED SIR THOMAS MERES WHO LIKE HIMSELF RANKED AMONG THE TRIMMERS JEFFREYS WHO MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF CROSSING THE LORD KEEPER
742-128034-0048 HAD PRESSED THE CLAIMS OF SIR JOHN TREVOR TREVOR HAD BEEN BRED HALF A PETTIFOGGER AND HALF A GAMBLER HAD BROUGHT TO POLITICAL LIFE SENTIMENTS AND PRINCIPLES WORTHY OF BOTH HIS CALLINGS HAD BECOME A PARASITE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE
742-128034-0049 AND COULD ON OCCASION IMITATE NOT UNSUCCESSFULLY THE VITUPERATIVE STYLE OF HIS PATRON THE MINION OF JEFFREYS WAS AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED PREFERRED BY JAMES
742-128034-0050 HE WAS THE RIGHT HEIR MALE
742-128034-0051 WHO HAD BEEN BROTHER IN LAW OF KING HENRY THE EIGHTH AND PROTECTOR OF THE REALM OF ENGLAND IN THE LIMITATION OF THE DUKEDOM OF SOMERSET THE ELDER SON OF THE PROTECTOR HAD BEEN POSTPONED TO THE YOUNGER SON
742-128034-0052 FROM THE YOUNGER SON THE DUKES OF SOMERSET WERE DESCENDED FROM THE ELDER SON WAS DESCENDED THE FAMILY WHICH DWELT AT BERRY POMEROY SEYMOUR'S FORTUNE WAS LARGE
742-128034-0053 NOR WAS THE IMPORTANCE DERIVED FROM DESCENT AND WEALTH THE ONLY IMPORTANCE WHICH BELONGED TO HIM HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST SKILFUL DEBATERS AND MEN OF BUSINESS IN THE KINGDOM HE HAD SATE MANY YEARS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
742-128034-0054 HAD STUDIED ALL ITS RULES AND USAGES AND THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD ITS PECULIAR TEMPER HE HAD BEEN ELECTED SPEAKER IN THE LATE REIGN UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MADE THAT DISTINCTION PECULIARLY HONOURABLE
742-128034-0055 DURING SEVERAL GENERATIONS NONE BUT LAWYERS HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE CHAIR AND HE WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WHOSE ABILITIES AND ACQUIREMENTS HAD ENABLED HIM TO BREAK THAT LONG PRESCRIPTION
742-128034-0056 HE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY HELD HIGH POLITICAL OFFICE
742-128034-0057 BUT HIS HAUGHTY AND UNACCOMMODATING TEMPER HAD GIVEN SO MUCH DISGUST THAT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO RETIRE HE WAS A TORY AND A CHURCHMAN HE HAD STRENUOUSLY OPPOSED THE EXCLUSION BILL
742-128034-0058 HE HAD BEEN PERSECUTED BY THE WHIGS
742-128034-0059 AND HE COULD THEREFORE SAFELY VENTURE TO HOLD LANGUAGE FOR WHICH ANY PERSON SUSPECTED OF REPUBLICANISM WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE TOWER HE HAD LONG BEEN AT THE HEAD OF A STRONG PARLIAMENTARY CONNECTION
742-128034-0060 TO OPULENCE AND ILLUSTRIOUS DESCENT MUST BE HIGHLY CONSIDERED BUT IN A HOUSE OF COMMONS FROM WHICH MANY OF THE MOST EMINENT ORATORS AND PARLIAMENTARY TACTICIANS OF THE AGE WERE EXCLUDED
742-128034-0061 WHO HAD NEVER HEARD A DEBATE THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH A MAN WAS PECULIARLY FORMIDABLE
742-128034-0062 HE WAS LICENTIOUS PROFANE CORRUPT TOO PROUD TO BEHAVE WITH COMMON POLITENESS YET NOT TOO PROUD TO POCKET ILLICIT GAIN BUT HE WAS SO USEFUL AN ALLY
742-128034-0063 THAT HE WAS FREQUENTLY COURTED
742-128034-0064 HIS INTEREST HAD BEEN WEAKENED IN SOME PLACES BY THE REMODELLING OF THE WESTERN BOROUGHS HIS PRIDE HAD BEEN WOUNDED BY THE ELEVATION OF TREVOR TO THE CHAIR
