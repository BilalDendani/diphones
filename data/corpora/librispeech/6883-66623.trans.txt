6883-66623-0000 WOLF TAKES VENGEANCE UPON HIS PEOPLE FROM THAT HOUR WAS BORN IN RODERICK DREW'S BREAST A STRANGE IMPERISHABLE DESIRE WILLINGLY AT THIS MOMENT WOULD HE HAVE GIVEN UP THE WINTER TRAPPING TO HAVE PURSUED THAT GOLDEN IGNIS FATUUS OF ALL AGES
6883-66623-0001 THE LURE OF GOLD TO HIM THE STORY OF THE OLD CABIN THE SKELETONS AND THE TREASURE OF THE BUCKSKIN BAG WAS COMPLETE THOSE SKELETONS HAD ONCE BEEN MEN THEY HAD FOUND A MINE
6883-66623-0002 AND THAT TREASURE GROUND WAS SOMEWHERE NEAR
6883-66623-0003 IN A FLASH HE HAD SOLVED THAT MYSTERY THE MEN HAD JUST BEGUN TO GATHER THEIR TREASURE WHEN THEY HAD FOUGHT WHAT WAS MORE LOGICAL THAN THAT ONE DAY TWO THREE
6883-66623-0004 MUKOKI HAD GRINNED AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH AN AIR OF STUPENDOUS DOUBT WHEN ROD HAD TOLD HIM THAT THE GOLD LAY BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS SO NOW THE YOUTH KEPT HIS THOUGHTS TO HIMSELF IT WAS A SILENT TRAIL HOME
6883-66623-0005 ROD'S MIND WAS TOO ACTIVE IN ITS NEW CHANNEL AND HE WAS TOO DEEPLY ABSORBED IN IMPRESSING UPON HIS MEMORY CERTAIN LANDMARKS WHICH THEY PASSED TO ASK QUESTIONS AND MUKOKI WITH THE NATURAL TACITURNITY OF HIS RACE
6883-66623-0006 SELDOM FOUND OCCASION TO BREAK INTO CONVERSATION UNLESS SPOKEN TO FIRST ALTHOUGH HIS EYES WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE ALERT ROD COULD SEE NO WAY IN WHICH A DESCENT COULD BE MADE INTO THE CHASM FROM THE RIDGE THEY WERE ON
6883-66623-0007 SUNLESS GULCH AT HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT WABI WOULD JOIN IN THE ADVENTURE
6883-66623-0008 HE WAS REASONABLY SURE THAT FROM SOMEWHERE ON THE OPPOSITE RIDGE A DESCENT COULD BE MADE INTO IT WABI WAS IN CAMP WHEN THEY ARRIVED
6883-66623-0009 THE BIRDS WERE ALREADY CLEANED FOR THEIR EARLY SUPPER AND A THICK SLICE OF VENISON STEAK WAS ADDED TO THE MENU DURING THE PREPARATION OF THE MEAL
6883-66623-0010 BUT WABI BETRAYED ONLY PASSING FLASHES OF INTEREST AT TIMES HE SEEMED STRANGELY PREOCCUPIED AND WOULD STAND IN AN IDLE CONTEMPLATIVE MOOD
6883-66623-0011 OR THE STOVE FINALLY AFTER AROUSING HIMSELF FROM ONE OF THESE MOMENTARY SPELLS HE PULLED A BRASS SHELL FROM HIS POCKET AND HELD IT OUT TO THE OLD INDIAN SEE HERE HE SAID
6883-66623-0012 MUKOKI CLUTCHED AT THE SHELL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ANOTHER NEWLY FOUND NUGGET OF GOLD THE SHELL WAS EMPTY THE LETTERING ON THE RIM WAS STILL VERY DISTINCT
6883-66623-0013 WHY THAT'S A SHELL FROM ROD'S GUN
6883-66623-0014 AND IT'S AN AUTO LOADING SHELL THERE ARE ONLY THREE GUNS LIKE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY I'VE GOT ONE MUKOKI HAS ANOTHER AND YOU LOST THE THIRD IN YOUR FIGHT WITH THE WOONGAS
6883-66623-0015 THE VENISON HAD BEGUN TO BURN AND MUKOKI QUICKLY TRANSFERRED IT TO THE TABLE WITHOUT A WORD THE THREE SAT DOWN TO THEIR MEAL THAT MEANS THE WOONGAS ARE ON OUR TRAIL DECLARED ROD PRESENTLY
6883-66623-0016 IT CERTAINLY IS PROOF THAT THEY ARE OR HAVE BEEN QUITE RECENTLY ON THIS SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THEY KNOW WE ARE HERE THE TRAIL I STRUCK WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM CAMP IT WAS AT LEAST TWO DAYS OLD THREE INDIANS ON SNOW SHOES WERE TRAVELING NORTH
6883-66623-0017 I FOLLOWED BACK ON THEIR TRAIL AND FOUND AFTER A TIME THAT THE INDIANS HAD COME FROM THE NORTH WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE SIMPLY ON A HUNTING EXPEDITION CUT A CIRCLE SOUTHWARD AND THEN RETURNED TO THEIR CAMP I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WILL COME FARTHER SOUTH BUT WE MUST KEEP OUR EYES OPEN
6883-66623-0018 WABI'S DESCRIPTION OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE STRANGE TRAIL TURNED GAVE GREAT SATISFACTION TO MUKOKI WHO NODDED AFFIRMATIVELY WHEN THE YOUNG HUNTER EXPRESSED IT AS HIS BELIEF THAT THE WOONGAS WOULD NOT COME SO FAR AS THEIR CAMP
6883-66623-0019 BUT THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR PRESENCE CHILLED THE BUOYANT SPIRITS OF THE HUNTERS THERE WAS HOWEVER A NEW SPICE OF ADVENTURE LURKING IN THIS POSSIBLE PERIL THAT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER DISPLEASING
6883-66623-0020 AND BY THE TIME THE MEAL WAS AT AN END SOMETHING LIKE A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN HAD BEEN FORMED THE HUNTERS WOULD NOT WAIT TO BE ATTACKED AND THEN ACT IN SELF DEFENSE POSSIBLY AT A DISADVANTAGE THEY WOULD BE CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THE WOONGAS
6883-66623-0021 AND IF A FRESH TRAIL OR A CAMP WAS FOUND THEY WOULD BEGIN THE MAN HUNT THEMSELVES THE SUN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SINK BEHIND THE DISTANT HILLS IN THE SOUTHWEST WHEN THE HUNTERS AGAIN LEFT CAMP WOLF HAD RECEIVED NOTHING TO EAT SINCE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
6883-66623-0022 AND WITH INCREASING HUNGER THE FIERY IMPATIENCE LURKING IN HIS EYES AND THE RESTLESSNESS OF HIS MOVEMENTS BECAME MORE NOTICEABLE MUKOKI CALLED ATTENTION TO THESE SYMPTOMS WITH A GLOATING SATISFACTION THE GLOOM OF EARLY EVENING WAS ENVELOPING
6883-66623-0023 THE WILDERNESS BY THE TIME THE THREE WOLF HUNTERS REACHED THE SWAMP IN WHICH ROD HAD SLAIN THE BUCK WHILE HE CARRIED THE GUNS AND PACKS MUKOKI AND WABIGOON DRAGGED THE BUCK BETWEEN THEM TO THE HUGE FLAT TOP ROCK
6883-66623-0024 SEVERAL SAPLINGS WERE CUT AND BY MEANS OF A LONG ROPE OF BABEESH THE DEER WAS DRAGGED UP THE SIDE OF THE ROCK UNTIL IT RESTED SECURELY UPON THE FLAT SPACE FROM THE DEAD BUCK'S NECK THE BABEESH ROPE WAS NOW STRETCHED ACROSS THE INTERVENING SPACE BETWEEN THE ROCK
6883-66623-0025 AND THE CLUMP OF CEDARS IN WHICH THE HUNTERS WERE TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES IN TWO OF THESE CEDARS AT A DISTANCE OF A DOZEN FEET FROM THE GROUND WERE QUICKLY MADE THREE PLATFORMS OF SAPLINGS UPON WHICH THE AMBUSHED WATCHERS COULD COMFORTABLY SEAT THEMSELVES
6883-66623-0026 BY THE TIME COMPLETE DARKNESS HAD FALLEN THE TRAP WAS FINISHED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A DETAIL WHICH ROD FOLLOWED WITH GREAT INTEREST FROM INSIDE HIS CLOTHES WHERE IT HAD BEEN KEPT WARM BY HIS BODY MUKOKI PRODUCED THE FLASK OF BLOOD
6883-66623-0027 THE REMAINDER HE DISTRIBUTED DROP BY DROP IN TRAILS RUNNING TOWARD THE SWAMP AND PLAINS THERE STILL REMAINED THREE HOURS BEFORE THE MOON WOULD BE UP AND THE HUNTERS NOW JOINED WOLF WHO HAD BEEN FASTENED HALF WAY UP THE RIDGE
6883-66623-0028 IN THE SHELTER OF A BIG ROCK A SMALL FIRE WAS BUILT AND DURING THEIR LONG WAIT THE HUNTERS PASSED THE TIME AWAY BY BROILING AND EATING CHUNKS OF VENISON
6883-66623-0029 IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK BEFORE THE MOON ROSE ABOVE THE EDGE OF THE WILDERNESS THIS GREAT ORB OF THE NORTHERN NIGHT SEEMED TO HOLD A NEVER ENDING FASCINATION FOR ROD
6883-66623-0030 IT CREPT ABOVE THE FORESTS A GLOWING THROBBING BALL OF RED QUIVERING AND PALPITATING
6883-66623-0031 IT WAS THEN THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WAS LIGHTED UP UNDER IT IT WAS THEN THAT MUKOKI SPEAKING SOFTLY BECKONED THE OTHERS TO FOLLOW HIM AND WITH WOLF AT HIS SIDE WENT DOWN THE RIDGE
6883-66623-0032 MAKING A CIRCUIT AROUND THE BACK OF THE ROCK MUKOKI PAUSED NEAR A SMALL SAPLING TWENTY YARDS FROM THE DEAD BUCK AND SECURED WOLF BY HIS BABEESH THONG
6883-66623-0033 HARDLY HAD HE DONE SO WHEN THE ANIMAL BEGAN TO EXHIBIT SIGNS OF EXCITEMENT HE TROTTED ABOUT NERVOUSLY SNIFFING THE AIR GATHERING THE WIND FROM EVERY DIRECTION AND HIS JAWS DROPPED WITH A SNARLING WHINE
6883-66623-0034 THEN HE STRUCK ONE OF THE CLOTS OF BLOOD IN THE SNOW COME WHISPERED WABI PULLING AT ROD'S SLEEVE COME QUIETLY THEY SLIPPED BACK AMONG THE SHADOWS OF THE SPRUCE AND WATCHED WOLF IN UNBROKEN SILENCE
6883-66623-0035 THE ANIMAL NOW STOOD RIGIDLY OVER THE BLOOD CLOT HIS HEAD WAS LEVEL WITH HIS QUIVERING BACK HIS EARS HALF ASLANT HIS NOSTRILS POINTING TO A STRANGE THRILLING SCENT THAT CAME TO HIM FROM SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IN THE MOONLIGHT
6883-66623-0036 ONCE MORE THE INSTINCT OF HIS BREED WAS FLOODING THE SOUL OF THE CAPTIVE WOLF THERE WAS THE ODOR OF BLOOD IN HIS WIDENING NOSTRILS IT WAS NOT THE BLOOD OF THE CAMP OF THE SLAUGHTERED GAME DRAGGED IN BY HUMAN HANDS BEFORE HIS EYES
6883-66623-0037 IT WAS THE BLOOD OF THE CHASE A FLASHING MEMORY OF HIS CAPTORS TURNED THE ANIMAL'S HEAD FOR AN INSTANT IN BACKWARD INSPECTION THEY WERE GONE HE COULD NEITHER HEAR NOR SEE THEM
6883-66623-0038 THE STRANGE SCENT THE GAME SCENT THAT WAS COMING TO HIM MORE CLEARLY EVERY INSTANT HE CRUNCHED ABOUT CAUTIOUSLY IN THE SNOW HE FOUND OTHER SPOTS OF BLOOD AND TO THE WATCHERS THERE CAME A LOW
6883-66623-0039 LONG WHINE THAT SEEMED ABOUT TO END IN THE WOLF SONG THE BLOOD TRAILS WERE LEADING HIM AWAY TOWARD THE GAME SCENT AND HE TUGGED VICIOUSLY AT THE BABEESH THAT HELD HIM CAPTIVE GNAWING AT IT VAINLY LIKE AN ANGRY DOG
6883-66623-0040 FORGETTING WHAT EXPERIENCE HAD TAUGHT HIM MANY TIMES BEFORE EACH MOMENT ADDED TO HIS EXCITEMENT HE RAN ABOUT THE SAPLING GULPED MOUTHFULS OF THE BLOODY SNOW
6883-66623-0041 AND EACH TIME HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS OPEN DRIPPING JAWS HELD TOWARD THE DEAD BUCK ON THE ROCK THE GAME WAS VERY NEAR BRUTE SENSE TOLD HIM THAT
6883-66623-0042 KILL KILL HE MADE ANOTHER EFFORT TORE UP THE SNOW IN HIS FRANTIC ENDEAVORS TO FREE HIMSELF TO BREAK LOOSE TO FOLLOW IN THE WILD GLAD CRY OF FREED SAVAGERY IN THE CALLING OF HIS PEOPLE HE FAILED AGAIN
6883-66623-0043 PANTING WHINING IN PITEOUS HELPLESSNESS THEN HE SETTLED UPON HIS HAUNCHES AT THE END OF HIS BABEESH THONG
6883-66623-0044 THERE CAME THEN A LOW WHINING WAIL LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE DEATH SONG OF A HUSKY DOG A WAIL THAT GREW IN LENGTH AND IN STRENGTH AND IN VOLUME UNTIL IT ROSE WEIRDLY AMONG THE MOUNTAINS
6883-66623-0045 AND SWEPT FAR OUT OVER THE PLAINS THE HUNT CALL OF THE WOLF ON THE TRAIL WHICH CALLS TO HIM THE FAMISHED GRAY GAUNT OUTLAWS OF THE WILDERNESS AS THE BUGLER'S NOTES CALL HIS FELLOWS ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
6883-66623-0046 THREE TIMES THAT BLOOD THRILLING CRY WENT UP FROM THE CAPTIVE WOLF'S THROAT AND BEFORE THOSE CRIES HAD DIED AWAY THE THREE HUNTERS WERE PERCHED UPON THEIR PLATFORMS AMONG THE SPRUCE THERE FOLLOWED NOW
6883-66623-0047 THE OMINOUS WAITING SILENCE OF AN AWAKENED WILDERNESS ROD COULD HEAR HIS HEART THROBBING WITHIN HIM HE FORGOT THE INTENSE COLD HIS NERVES TINGLED HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE ENDLESS PLAINS WHITE AND MYSTERIOUSLY BEAUTIFUL AS THEY LAY
6883-66623-0048 BATHED IN THE GLOW OF THE MOON AND WABI KNEW MORE THAN HE WHAT WAS HAPPENING ALL OVER THAT WILD DESOLATION THE CALL OF THE WOLF HAD CARRIED ITS MEANING DOWN THERE WHERE A LAKE LAY SILENT IN ITS WINTER SLEEP
6883-66623-0049 AND HERE AND THERE IN THAT WORLD OF WILD THINGS THE GAUNT HUNGRY PEOPLE OF WOLF'S BLOOD STOPPED IN THEIR TRAILS AND TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARD THE SIGNAL THAT WAS COMING IN WAILING ECHOES TO THEIR EARS
6883-66623-0050 AND THEN THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN FROM AFAR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MILE AWAY THERE CAME AN ANSWERING CRY AND AT THAT CRY THE WOLF AT THE END OF HIS BABEESH THONG SETTLED UPON HIS HAUNCHES AGAIN
6883-66623-0051 AND SENT BACK THE CALL THAT COMES ONLY WHEN THERE IS BLOOD UPON THE TRAIL OR WHEN NEAR THE KILLING TIME THERE WAS NOT THE RUSTLE OF A BOUGH NOT A WORD SPOKEN BY THE SILENT WATCHERS IN THE SPRUCE
6883-66623-0052 MUKOKI HAD SLIPPED BACK AND HALF LAY ACROSS HIS SUPPORT IN SHOOTING ATTITUDE WABI HAD BRACED A FOOT AND HIS RIFLE WAS HALF TO HIS SHOULDER LEVELED OVER A KNEE
6883-66623-0053 AIMING THROUGH A CROTCH THAT GAVE A REST TO HIS ARM IN A FEW MOMENTS THERE CAME AGAIN THE HOWL OF THE DISTANT WOLF ON THE PLAINS AND THIS TIME IT WAS JOINED BY ANOTHER AWAY TO THE WESTWARD AND AFTER THAT
6883-66623-0054 FOR THE FIRST TIME ROD AND WABI HEARD THE GLOATING CHUCKLE OF MUKOKI IN HIS SPRUCE A DOZEN FEET AWAY AT THE INCREASING RESPONSES OF HIS BRETHREN WOLF BECAME MORE FRANTIC IN HIS EFFORTS
6883-66623-0055 THE SCENT OF FRESH BLOOD AND OF WOUNDED GAME WAS BECOMING MADDENING TO THE CAPTIVE BUT HIS FRENZY NO LONGER BETRAYED ITSELF IN FUTILE EFFORTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE BABEESH THONG WOLF KNEW THAT HIS CRIES WERE ASSEMBLING THE HUNT PACK
6883-66623-0056 AND THERE WERE NOW ONLY MOMENTARY RESTS BETWEEN THE DEEP THROATED EXHORTATIONS WHICH HE SENT IN ALL DIRECTIONS INTO THE NIGHT SUDDENLY ALMOST FROM THE SWAMP ITSELF THERE CAME A QUICK EXCITED YELPING REPLY
6883-66623-0057 AND WABI GRIPPED ROD BY THE ARM HE HAS STRUCK THE PLACE WHERE YOU KILLED THE BUCK HE WHISPERED
6883-66623-0058 AND A MOMENT LATER THE WATCHERS SAW A GAUNT SHADOW FORM RUNNING SWIFTLY OVER THE SNOW TOWARD WOLF FOR AN INSTANT AS THE TWO BEASTS OF PREY MET THERE FELL A SILENCE THEN BOTH ANIMALS JOINED IN THE WAILING HUNT PACK CRY
6883-66623-0059 TO THE STILL MORE THRILLING SIGNAL THAT TOLD THE GATHERING PACK OF GAME AT BAY SWIFTLY THE WOLVES CLOSED IN FROM OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN ONE CAME AND JOINED THE WOLF AT THE ROCK WITHOUT THE HUNTERS SEEING HIS APPROACH
6883-66623-0060 FROM OUT OF THE SWAMP THERE CAME A PACK OF THREE AND NOW ABOUT THE ROCK THERE GREW A MADDENED YELPING HORDE CLAMBERING AND SCRAMBLING AND FIGHTING IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CLIMB UP TO THE GAME THAT WAS SO NEAR AND YET BEYOND THEIR REACH
6883-66623-0061 AND SIXTY FEET AWAY WOLF CROUCHED WATCHING THE GATHERING OF HIS CLAN HELPLESS PANTING FROM HIS CHOKING EFFORTS TO FREE HIMSELF AND QUIETING GRADUALLY QUIETING UNTIL
6883-66623-0062 IN SULLEN SILENCE HE LOOKED UPON THE SCENE AS THOUGH HE KNEW THE MOMENT WAS VERY NEAR WHEN THAT THRILLING SPECTACLE WOULD BE CHANGED INTO A SCENE OF DIREST TRAGEDY
6883-66623-0063 AND IT WAS MUKOKI WHO HAD FIRST SAID THAT THIS WAS THE VENGEANCE OF WOLF UPON HIS PEOPLE FROM MUKOKI THERE NOW CAME A FAINT HISSING WARNING AND WABI THREW HIS RIFLE TO HIS SHOULDER
6883-66623-0064 AND COULD FEEL THE ANIMAL SLOWLY SLIPPING FROM THE FLAT LEDGE A MOMENT MORE AND THE BUCK TUMBLED DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE WAITING PACK AS FLIES GATHER UPON A LUMP OF SUGAR THE FAMISHED ANIMALS NOW CROWDED AND CRUSHED AND FOUGHT OVER THE DEER'S BODY
6883-66623-0065 AND AS THEY CAME THUS TOGETHER THERE SOUNDED THE QUICK SHARP SIGNAL TO FIRE FROM MUKOKI FOR FIVE SECONDS THE EDGE OF THE SPRUCE WAS A BLAZE OF DEATH DEALING FLASHES
6883-66623-0066 AND THE DEAFENING REPORTS OF THE TWO RIFLES AND THE BIG COLT DROWNED THE CRIES AND STRUGGLES OF THE ANIMALS WHEN THOSE FIVE SECONDS WERE OVER FIFTEEN SHOTS HAD BEEN FIRED AND FIVE SECONDS LATER
6883-66623-0067 THE VAST BEAUTIFUL SILENCE OF THE WILDERNESS NIGHT HAD FALLEN AGAIN ABOUT THE ROCK WAS THE SILENCE OF DEATH BROKEN ONLY FAINTLY BY THE LAST GASPING THROES OF THE ANIMALS THAT LAY DYING IN THE SNOW
6883-66623-0068 IN THE TREES THERE SOUNDED THE METALLIC CLINK OF LOADING SHELLS WABI SPOKE FIRST I BELIEVE WE DID A GOOD JOB MUKOKI MUKOKI'S REPLY WAS TO SLIP DOWN HIS TREE
6883-66623-0069 THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AND HASTENED ACROSS TO THE ROCK FIVE BODIES LAY MOTIONLESS IN THE SNOW A SIXTH WAS DRAGGING HIMSELF AROUND THE SIDE OF THE ROCK AND MUKOKI ATTACKED IT WITH HIS BELT AX STILL A SEVENTH HAD RUN FOR A DOZEN RODS
6883-66623-0070 DRAGGING THE WOLF WITH THEM MUKOKI WAS STANDING AS RIGID AS A STATUE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS FACE TURNED INTO THE NORTH HE POINTED ONE ARM FAR OUT OVER THE PLAINS AND SAID WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD SEE
6883-66623-0071 FAR OUT IN THAT SILENT DESOLATION THE HUNTERS SAW A LURID FLASH OF FLAME IT CLIMBED UP AND UP UNTIL IT FILLED THE NIGHT ABOVE IT WITH A DULL GLOW A SINGLE UNBROKEN STREAM OF FIRE
6883-66623-0072 THAT ROSE FAR ABOVE THE SWAMPS AND FORESTS OF THE PLAINS THAT'S A BURNING JACKPINE SAID WABIGOON BURNING JACKPINE AGREED THE OLD WARRIOR THEN HE ADDED
