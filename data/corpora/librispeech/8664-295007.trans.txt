8664-295007-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE IMPRISONED IN DOCTOR'S HOUSE THE FIRST BUSINESS NEXT DAY WAS TO ARRANGE FOR A HUNT IT WAS SETTLED THAT ALTAMONT BELL AND HATTERAS SHOULD FORM THE PARTY
8664-295007-0001 WHILE CLAWBONNY SHOULD GO AND EXPLORE AS FAR AS ISLE JOHNSON AND MAKE SOME HYDROGRAPHIC NOTES AND JOHNSON SHOULD REMAIN BEHIND TO KEEP HOUSE THE THREE HUNTERS SOON COMPLETED THEIR PREPARATIONS
8664-295007-0002 THEY ARMED THEMSELVES EACH WITH A DOUBLE BARRELLED REVOLVER AND A RIFLE AND TOOK PLENTY OF POWDER AND SHOT EACH MAN ALSO CARRIED IN HIS BELT HIS INDISPENSABLE SNOW KNIFE AND HATCHET
8664-295007-0003 AND A SMALL SUPPLY OF PEMMICAN IN CASE NIGHT SHOULD SURPRISE THEM BEFORE THEIR RETURN
8664-295007-0004 WHO FRISKED AND GAMBOLLED WITH DELIGHT THEY WENT UP THE HILL TO THE EAST ACROSS THE CONE AND DOWN INTO THE PLAIN BELOW THE DOCTOR NEXT TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AFTER AGREEING WITH JOHNSON ON A SIGNAL OF ALARM IN CASE OF DANGER
8664-295007-0005 HE BEGAN BY UNFASTENING THE GREENLAND DOGS AND LETTING THEM OUT FOR A RUN AFTER THEIR LONG WEARISOME CONFINEMENT THEN HE ATTENDED TO DIVERS HOUSEKEEPING MATTERS HE HAD TO REPLENISH THE STOCK OF COMBUSTIBLES AND PROVISIONS
8664-295007-0006 TO ARRANGE THE STORE HOUSES TO MEND SEVERAL BROKEN UTENSILS TO REPAIR THE RENTS IN COVERLETS AND GET NEW SHOES READY FOR SUMMER EXCURSIONS THERE WAS NO LACK OF WORK
8664-295007-0007 HE THOUGHT WITH REGRET OVER THE CAPTAIN'S OBSTINACY AND YET HE FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING GRAND AND EVEN HEROIC IN HIS DETERMINATION THAT NEITHER AN AMERICAN NOR AN AMERICAN SHIP SHOULD FIRST TOUCH THE POLE
8664-295007-0008 THE HUNTERS HAD BEEN GONE ABOUT AN HOUR WHEN JOHNSON SUDDENLY HEARD THE REPORT OF A GUN CAPITAL HE EXCLAIMED THEY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING AND PRETTY QUICKLY TOO FOR ME TO HEAR THEIR GUNS SO DISTINCTLY THE ATMOSPHERE MUST BE VERY CLEAR
8664-295007-0009 FOLLOWED BY THE FIVE HUGE BEARS THEIR SIX BALLS HAD EVIDENTLY TAKEN NO EFFECT AND THE TERRIBLE MONSTERS WERE CLOSE ON THEIR HEELS HATTERAS WHO BROUGHT UP THE REAR
8664-295007-0010 COULD ONLY MANAGE TO KEEP OFF HIS PURSUERS BY FLINGING DOWN ONE ARTICLE AFTER ANOTHER FIRST HIS CAP THEN HIS HATCHET AND FINALLY HIS GUN
8664-295007-0011 HE KNEW THAT THE INQUISITIVE BEARS WOULD STOP AND EXAMINE EVERY OBJECT SNIFFING ALL ROUND IT AND THIS GAVE HIM A LITTLE TIME OTHERWISE HE COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED FOR THESE ANIMALS OUTSTRIP THE FLEETEST HORSE
8664-295007-0012 AND ONE MONSTER WAS SO NEAR THAT HATTERAS HAD TO BRANDISH HIS KNIFE VIGOROUSLY TO WARD OFF A TREMENDOUS BLOW OF HIS PAW AT LAST THOUGH PANTING AND OUT OF BREATH THE THREE MEN REACHED JOHNSON SAFELY
8664-295007-0013 AND SLID DOWN THE ROCK WITH HIM INTO THE SNOW HOUSE THE BEARS STOPPED SHORT ON THE UPPER PLATEAU AND HATTERAS AND HIS COMPANIONS LOST NO TIME IN BARRING AND BARRICADING THEM OUT HERE WE ARE AT LAST EXCLAIMED HATTERAS
8664-295007-0014 WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES BETTER NOW IT IS FIVE AGAINST FIVE FOUR SAID JOHNSON IN A FRIGHTENED VOICE HOW THE DOCTOR REPLIED JOHNSON POINTING TO THE EMPTY SITTING ROOM WELL
8664-295007-0015 HE IS IN ISLE JOHNSON A BAD JOB FOR HIM SAID BELL BUT WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM TO HIS FATE IN THIS FASHION SAID ALTAMONT NO
8664-295007-0016 THEY ARE THERE HE EXCLAIMED ALL ASKED BELL THE WHOLE PACK ALTAMONT RUSHED TO THE WINDOWS AND BEGAN TO FILL UP THE DEEP EMBRASURE WITH BLOCKS OF ICE WHICH HE BROKE OFF THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE
8664-295007-0017 HIS COMPANIONS FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE SILENTLY
8664-295007-0018 TO TELL THE SIMPLE TRUTH HOWEVER IT WAS NOT THEIR OWN DANGER THAT OCCUPIED THEIR THOUGHTS BUT THEIR ABSENT FRIEND THE DOCTOR'S IT WAS FOR HIM THEY TREMBLED NOT FOR THEMSELVES POOR CLAWBONNY
8664-295007-0019 SO GOOD AND DEVOTED AS HE HAD BEEN TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE LITTLE COLONY THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD BEEN SEPARATED FROM HIM EXTREME PERIL AND MOST LIKELY A FRIGHTFUL DEATH AWAITED HIM
8664-295007-0020 FOR HE MIGHT RETURN UNSUSPECTINGLY TO FORT PROVIDENCE
8664-295007-0021 UNLESS I AM MUCH MISTAKEN HE MUST BE ON GUARD YOUR REPEATED SHOTS CANNOT BUT HAVE WARNED HIM HE MUST SURELY BE AWARE THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAS HAPPENED BUT SUPPOSE HE WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO HEAR THEM REPLIED ALTAMONT
8664-295007-0022 OR HAS NOT UNDERSTOOD THE CAUSE OF THEM IT IS TEN CHANCES TO ONE BUT HE'LL COME QUICKLY BACK NEVER IMAGINING THE DANGER THE BEARS ARE SCREENED FROM SIGHT BY THE CRAG COMPLETELY
8664-295007-0023 WE MUST GET RID OF THEM BEFORE HE COMES SAID HATTERAS
8664-295007-0024 THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO BARRICADE THE ENTRANCE PASSAGE BUT THE BEARS COULD EASILY FIND A WAY IN IF THEY CHOSE SO IT WAS THOUGHT ADVISABLE TO KEEP A CLOSE WATCH ON THEIR MOVEMENTS OUTSIDE BY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY IN EACH ROOM
8664-295007-0025 SO AS TO BE ABLE TO RESIST ALL ATTEMPTS AT INVASION THEY COULD HEAR THEM DISTINCTLY PROWLING ABOUT GROWLING AND SCRAPING THE WALLS WITH THEIR ENORMOUS PAWS HOWEVER SOME ACTION MUST BE TAKEN SPEEDILY
8664-295007-0026 FOR TIME WAS PASSING ALTAMONT RESOLVED TO TRY A PORT HOLE THROUGH WHICH HE MIGHT FIRE ON HIS ASSAILANTS HE HAD SOON SCOOPED OUT A HOLE IN THE WALL BUT HIS GUN WAS HARDLY PUSHED THROUGH WHEN IT WAS SEIZED WITH IRRESISTIBLE FORCE
8664-295007-0027 AND WRESTED FROM HIS GRASP BEFORE HE COULD EVEN FIRE CONFOUND IT HE EXCLAIMED WE'RE NO MATCH FOR THEM AND HE HASTENED TO STOP UP THE BREACH AS FAST AS POSSIBLE THIS STATE OF THINGS HAD LASTED UPWARDS OF AN HOUR
8664-295007-0028 AND THERE SEEMED NO PROSPECT OF A TERMINATION THE QUESTION OF A SORTIE BEGAN NOW TO BE SERIOUSLY DISCUSSED THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF SUCCESS AS THE BEARS COULD NOT BE ATTACKED SEPARATELY
8664-295007-0029 BUT HATTERAS AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD GROWN SO IMPATIENT AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED WERE ALSO SO MUCH ASHAMED OF BEING KEPT IN PRISON BY BEASTS THAT THEY WOULD EVEN HAVE DARED THE RISK IF THE CAPTAIN HAD NOT SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF A NEW MODE OF DEFENCE
8664-295007-0030 HE TOOK JOHNSON'S FURNACE POKER AND THRUST IT INTO THE STOVE WHILE HE MADE AN OPENING IN THE SNOW WALL OR RATHER A PARTIAL OPENING FOR HE LEFT A THIN SHEET OF ICE ON THE OUTER SIDE AS SOON AS THE POKER WAS RED HOT
8664-295007-0031 HE SAID TO HIS COMRADES WHO STOOD EAGERLY WATCHING HIM WONDERING WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO THIS RED HOT BAR WILL KEEP OFF THE BEARS WHEN THEY TRY TO GET HOLD OF IT AND WE SHALL BE ABLE EASILY TO FIRE ACROSS IT WITHOUT LETTING THEM SNATCH AWAY OUR GUNS
8664-295007-0032 A GOOD IDEA SAID BELL POSTING HIMSELF BESIDE ALTAMONT HATTERAS WITHDREW THE POKER AND INSTANTLY PLUNGED IT IN THE WALL THE MELTING SNOW MADE A LOUD HISSING NOISE AND TWO BEARS RAN AND MADE A SNATCH AT THE GLOWING BAR
8664-295007-0033 BUT THEY FELL BACK WITH A TERRIBLE HOWL AND AT THE SAME MOMENT FOUR SHOTS RESOUNDED ONE AFTER THE OTHER HIT EXCLAIMED ALTAMONT HIT ECHOED BELL LET US REPEAT THE DOSE SAID HATTERAS CAREFULLY STOPPING UP THE OPENING MEANTIME
8664-295007-0034 THE POKER WAS AGAIN THRUST INTO THE FIRE AND IN A FEW MINUTES WAS READY FOR HATTERAS TO RECOMMENCE OPERATIONS ALTAMONT AND BELL RELOADED THEIR GUNS AND TOOK THEIR PLACES BUT THIS TIME THE POKER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH
8664-295007-0035 WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED JOHNSON WHAT'S THE MATTER WHY THOSE PLAGUEY ANIMALS ARE PILING UP BLOCK AFTER BLOCK INTENDING TO BURY US ALIVE IMPOSSIBLE LOOK FOR YOURSELF
8664-295007-0036 THE POKER CAN'T GET THROUGH I DECLARE IT IS GETTING ABSURD NOW IT WAS WORSE THAN ABSURD IT WAS ALARMING THINGS GREW WORSE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BEARS MEANT TO STIFLE THEIR PREY
8664-295007-0037 FOR THE SAGACIOUS ANIMALS WERE HEAPING UP HUGE MASSES WHICH WOULD MAKE ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TOO BAD SAID OLD JOHNSON WITH A MORTIFIED LOOK ONE MIGHT PUT UP WITH MEN BUT
8664-295007-0038 TO GO OUT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND THE THICK WALLS EXCLUDED ALL SOUND ALTAMONT WALKED IMPATIENTLY UP AND DOWN FULL OF EXASPERATION AND EXCITEMENT AT FINDING HIMSELF WORSTED FOR ONCE HATTERAS COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE DOCTOR
8664-295007-0039 WHAT COULD HE DO ASKED ALTAMONT OH HE'D MANAGE TO GET US OUT SOMEHOW HOW PRAY SAID THE AMERICAN CROSSLY IF I KNEW THAT I SHOULD NOT NEED HIM HOWEVER I KNOW WHAT HIS ADVICE JUST NOW WOULD BE
8664-295007-0040 WHAT TO TAKE SOME FOOD THAT CAN'T HURT US
8664-295007-0041 OH LET'S EAT BY ALL MEANS IF THAT WILL PLEASE YOU THOUGH WE'RE IN A RIDICULOUS NOT TO SAY HUMILIATING PLIGHT I'LL BET YOU WE'LL FIND A WAY OUT AFTER DINNER
8664-295007-0042 TRIED TO BE BRAVE AND UNCONCERNED ABOUT THE DANGER BUT HE COULD SCARCELY MANAGE IT HIS JOKES STUCK IN HIS THROAT MOREOVER THE WHOLE PARTY BEGAN TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GETTING DENSE
8664-295007-0043 FOR EVERY OPENING WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED THE STOVES WOULD HARDLY DRAW AND IT WAS EVIDENT WOULD SOON GO OUT ALTOGETHER FOR WANT OF OXYGEN HATTERAS WAS THE FIRST TO SEE THEIR FRESH DANGER AND HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO HIDE IT FROM HIS COMPANIONS
8664-295007-0044 IF THAT IS THE CASE SAID ALTAMONT WE MUST GET OUT AT ALL RISKS YES REPLIED HATTERAS BUT LET US WAIT TILL NIGHT WE WILL MAKE A HOLE IN THE ROOF AND LET IN A PROVISION OF AIR AND THEN ONE OF US CAN FIRE OUT OF IT ON THE BEARS
8664-295007-0045 IT IS THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO I SUPPOSE SAID ALTAMONT SO IT WAS AGREED BUT WAITING WAS HARD WORK AND ALTAMONT COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM GIVING VENT TO HIS IMPATIENCE BY THUNDERING MALEDICTIONS ON THE BEARS
8664-295007-0046 AND ABUSING THE ILL FATE WHICH HAD PLACED THEM IN SUCH AN AWKWARD AND HUMBLING PREDICAMENT
