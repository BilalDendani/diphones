705-157945-0000 WHEN IN REPLY TO AN INVITATION TO DINNER HE HAD HAD TO LISTEN TO AN ANGRY REPRIMAND FOR NOT HAVING PROVIDED HIS FULL QUOTA OF MEN NATASHA ON THE OTHER HAND
705-157945-0001 SO READY TO BE FOND OF HIM FOR BEING HIS FATHER AND OF HER FOR BEING HIS SISTER
705-157945-0002 THEY DROVE UP TO THE GLOOMY OLD HOUSE ON THE VOZDVIZHENKA AND ENTERED THE VESTIBULE WELL THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON US SAID THE COUNT
705-157945-0003 HALF IN JEST HALF IN EARNEST BUT NATASHA NOTICED THAT HER FATHER WAS FLURRIED ON ENTERING THE ANTEROOM AND INQUIRED TIMIDLY AND SOFTLY
705-157945-0004 WHETHER THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS WERE AT HOME WHEN THEY HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED A PERTURBATION WAS NOTICEABLE AMONG THE SERVANTS THE FOOTMAN WHO HAD GONE TO ANNOUNCE THEM
705-157945-0005 AND THEY WHISPERED TO ONE ANOTHER THEN A MAIDSERVANT RAN INTO THE HALL AND HURRIEDLY SAID SOMETHING MENTIONING THE PRINCESS AT LAST
705-157945-0006 AN OLD CROSS LOOKING FOOTMAN CAME AND ANNOUNCED TO THE ROSTOVS THAT THE PRINCE WAS NOT RECEIVING BUT THAT THE PRINCESS BEGGED THEM TO WALK UP
705-157945-0007 THE FIRST PERSON WHO CAME TO MEET THE VISITORS WAS MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE SHE GREETED THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER WITH SPECIAL POLITENESS
705-157945-0008 AND AT EASE FROM THE FIRST GLANCE PRINCESS MARY DID NOT LIKE NATASHA SHE THOUGHT HER TOO FASHIONABLY DRESSED FRIVOLOUSLY GAY AND VAIN
705-157945-0009 SHE WAS PREJUDICED AGAINST HER BY INVOLUNTARY ENVY OF HER BEAUTY YOUTH AND HAPPINESS AS WELL AS BY JEALOUSY OF HER BROTHER'S LOVE FOR HER
705-157945-0010 APART FROM THIS INSUPERABLE ANTIPATHY TO HER PRINCESS MARY WAS AGITATED JUST THEN
705-157945-0011 BUT THEY WERE NOT TO BE ADMITTED TO HIM
705-157945-0012 LEST THE PRINCE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT INDULGE IN SOME FREAK AS HE SEEMED MUCH UPSET BY THE ROSTOVS VISIT
705-157945-0013 BOWING AND LOOKING ROUND UNEASILY AS IF AFRAID THE OLD PRINCE MIGHT APPEAR I AM SO GLAD YOU SHOULD GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER VERY SORRY THE PRINCE IS STILL AILING
705-157945-0014 IN THE DOGS SQUARE AND THEN
705-157945-0015 THE COUNT HAD DEVISED THIS DIPLOMATIC RUSE AS HE AFTERWARDS TOLD HIS DAUGHTER TO GIVE THE FUTURE SISTERS IN LAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER FREELY
705-157945-0016 BUT ANOTHER MOTIVE WAS TO AVOID THE DANGER OF ENCOUNTERING THE OLD PRINCE OF WHOM HE WAS AFRAID HE DID NOT MENTION THIS TO HIS DAUGHTER BUT NATASHA NOTICED HER FATHER'S NERVOUSNESS AND ANXIETY
705-157945-0017 AND FELT MORTIFIED BY IT SHE BLUSHED FOR HIM GREW STILL ANGRIER AT HAVING BLUSHED AND LOOKED AT THE PRINCESS WITH A BOLD AND DEFIANT EXPRESSION WHICH SAID
705-157945-0018 THAT SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF ANYBODY THE PRINCESS TOLD THE COUNT THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED AND ONLY BEGGED HIM TO STAY LONGER AT ANNA SEMENOVNA'S AND HE DEPARTED
705-157945-0019 WHO WISHED TO HAVE A TETE A TETE WITH NATASHA MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND PERSISTENTLY TALKED ABOUT MOSCOW AMUSEMENTS AND THEATERS
705-157945-0020 NATASHA FELT OFFENDED BY THE HESITATION SHE HAD NOTICED IN THE ANTEROOM BY HER FATHER'S NERVOUSNESS
705-157945-0021 WAS MAKING A FAVOR OF RECEIVING HER AND SO EVERYTHING DISPLEASED HER SHE DID NOT LIKE PRINCESS MARY
705-157945-0022 NATASHA SUDDENLY SHRANK INTO HERSELF AND INVOLUNTARILY ASSUMED AN OFFHAND AIR WHICH ALIENATED PRINCESS MARY STILL MORE
705-157945-0023 AFTER FIVE MINUTES OF IRKSOME CONSTRAINED CONVERSATION
705-157945-0024 PRINCESS MARY LOOKED FRIGHTENED THE DOOR OPENED AND THE OLD PRINCE IN A DRESSING GOWN AND A WHITE NIGHTCAP CAME IN AH MADAM HE BEGAN MADAM COUNTESS
705-157945-0025 COUNTESS ROSTOVA IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN I BEG YOU TO EXCUSE ME TO EXCUSE ME I DID NOT KNOW MADAM
705-157945-0026 SO UNNATURALLY AND SO UNPLEASANTLY THAT PRINCESS MARY STOOD WITH DOWNCAST EYES
705-157945-0027 EITHER AT HER FATHER OR AT NATASHA NOR DID THE LATTER HAVING RISEN AND CURTSIED KNOW WHAT TO DO MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE ALONE SMILED AGREEABLY
705-157945-0028 I BEG YOU TO EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME GOD IS MY WITNESS I DID NOT KNOW MUTTERED THE OLD MAN AND AFTER LOOKING NATASHA OVER FROM HEAD TO FOOT HE WENT OUT
705-157945-0029 MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER HERSELF AFTER THIS APPARITION AND BEGAN SPEAKING ABOUT THE PRINCE'S INDISPOSITION
705-157945-0030 AND THE LONGER THEY DID SO WITHOUT SAYING WHAT THEY WANTED TO SAY
705-157945-0031 I COULDN'T BEGIN TALKING ABOUT HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT FRENCHWOMAN
705-157945-0032 AND BECAUSE WITHOUT KNOWING WHY SHE FELT IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SPEAK OF THE MARRIAGE WHEN THE COUNT WAS ALREADY LEAVING THE ROOM PRINCESS MARY WENT UP HURRIEDLY TO NATASHA
705-157945-0033 TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND SAID WITH A DEEP SIGH WAIT I MUST
705-157945-0034 NATASHA NOTICED THIS AND GUESSED ITS REASON I THINK PRINCESS IT IS NOT CONVENIENT TO SPEAK OF THAT NOW SHE SAID WITH EXTERNAL DIGNITY AND COLDNESS THOUGH SHE FELT THE TEARS CHOKING HER
705-157945-0035 THEY WAITED A LONG TIME FOR NATASHA TO COME TO DINNER THAT DAY SHE SAT IN HER ROOM CRYING LIKE A CHILD BLOWING HER NOSE AND SOBBING SONYA STOOD BESIDE HER KISSING HER HAIR
705-157945-0036 NATASHA WHAT IS IT ABOUT SHE ASKED WHAT DO THEY MATTER TO YOU IT WILL ALL PASS NATASHA
705-157945-0037 AS IF I DON'T TALK ABOUT IT NATASHA
705-157945-0038 KISS ME SAID SONYA NATASHA RAISED HER HEAD AND KISSING HER FRIEND ON THE LIPS PRESSED HER WET FACE AGAINST HER I CAN'T TELL YOU I DON'T KNOW
705-157945-0039 NO ONE'S TO BLAME SAID NATASHA IT'S MY FAULT BUT IT ALL HURTS TERRIBLY OH WHY DOESN'T HE COME
