7046-80695-0000 WAS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE LAKE WHERE TWO WILD DUCKS MADE THEIR HOME AND PASSED THEIR DAYS SWIMMING AND PLAYING IN ITS CLEAR WATERS
7046-80695-0001 AND HAD COME THERE BEFORE THEM AND LUCKILY INSTEAD OF TAKING A DISLIKE TO THE TURTLE
7046-80695-0002 THEY BECAME GREAT FRIENDS AND SPENT MOST OF THE DAY IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY ALL WENT ON SMOOTHLY AND HAPPILY TILL ONE SUMMER
7046-80695-0003 WHEN THE RAINS FAILED AND THE SUN SHONE SO FIERCELY THAT EVERY MORNING THERE WAS A LITTLE LESS WATER IN THE LAKE AND A LITTLE MORE MUD ON THE BANK THE WATER LILIES AROUND THE EDGE BEGAN TO DROOP
7046-80695-0004 AND THE DUCKS FAVOURITE SWIMMING PLACE WHERE THEY COULD DIVE THE DEEPEST TO GROW SHALLOWER AND SHALLOWER AT LENGTH THERE CAME A MORNING WHEN THE DUCKS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER UNEASILY
7046-80695-0005 AND BEFORE NIGHTFALL THEY HAD WHISPERED THAT IF AT THE END OF TWO DAYS RAIN HAD NOT COME THEY MUST FLY AWAY AND SEEK A NEW HOME FOR IF THEY STAYED IN THEIR OLD ONE WHICH THEY LOVED SO MUCH
7046-80695-0006 THEY WOULD CERTAINLY DIE OF THIRST EARNESTLY THEY WATCHED THE SKY FOR MANY HOURS BEFORE THEY TUCKED THEIR HEADS UNDER THEIR WINGS AND FELL ASLEEP FROM SHEER WEARINESS
7046-80695-0007 BUT NOT THE TINIEST CLOUD WAS TO BE SEEN COVERING THE STARS THAT SHONE SO BIG AND BRILLIANT AND HUNG SO LOW IN THE HEAVENS THAT YOU FELT AS IF YOU COULD TOUCH THEM SO WHEN THE MORNING BROKE
7046-80695-0008 THEY FOUND HIM COMFORTABLY CURLED UP ON A PILE OF DEAD RUSHES MORE THAN HALF ASLEEP FOR HE WAS OLD AND COULD NOT VENTURE OUT IN THE HEAT AS HE ONCE USED
7046-80695-0009 AH HERE YOU ARE HE CRIED I BEGAN TO WONDER IF I WAS EVER GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN FOR SOMEHOW THOUGH THE LAKE HAS GROWN SMALLER I SEEM TO HAVE GROWN WEAKER
7046-80695-0010 AND IT IS LONELY SPENDING ALL DAY AND NIGHT BY ONESELF OH MY FRIEND ANSWERED THE ELDER OF THE TWO DUCKS IF YOU HAVE SUFFERED WE HAVE SUFFERED ALSO BESIDES I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
7046-80695-0011 THAT I FEAR WILL CAUSE YOU GREATER PAIN STILL
7046-80695-0012 AND SEEK ANOTHER WHERE THE SUN'S RAYS DO NOT COME MY HEART BLEEDS TO SAY THIS FOR THERE IS NOTHING NOTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD WHICH WOULD HAVE INDUCED US TO SEPARATE FROM YOU
7046-80695-0013 THE TURTLE WAS SO ASTONISHED AS WELL AS SO DISTRESSED AT THE DUCK'S SPEECH THAT FOR A MOMENT HE COULD FIND NO WORDS TO REPLY
7046-80695-0014 HE SAID IN A SHAKY VOICE HOW CAN YOU THINK THAT I AM ABLE TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU WHEN FOR SO LONG YOU HAVE BEEN MY ONLY FRIENDS IF YOU LEAVE ME DEATH WILL SPEEDILY PUT AN END TO MY GRIEF
7046-80695-0015 OUR SORROW IS AS GREAT AS YOURS ANSWERED THE OTHER DUCK BUT WHAT CAN WE DO AND REMEMBER THAT IF WE ARE NOT HERE TO DRINK THE WATER
7046-80695-0016 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE BE SURE THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE PARTED US FROM ONE WHOM WE LOVE SO DEARLY MY FRIENDS REPLIED THE TURTLE
7046-80695-0017 IT STARES IN MINE ALSO BUT IN THE NAME OF ALL THE YEARS WE HAVE PASSED TOGETHER DO NOT I BESEECH YOU LEAVE ME TO PERISH HERE ALONE WHEREVER YOU MAY GO TAKE ME WITH YOU THERE WAS A PAUSE
7046-80695-0018 THE DUCKS FELT WRETCHED AT THE THOUGHT OF ABANDONING THEIR OLD COMRADE YET AT THE SAME TIME HOW COULD THEY GRANT HIS PRAYER IT SEEMED QUITE IMPOSSIBLE AND AT LENGTH ONE OF THEM SPOKE
7046-80695-0019 YET HOW CAN WE DO WHAT YOU ASK CONSIDER THAT LIKE YOURS OUR BODIES ARE HEAVY AND OUR FEET SMALL THEREFORE HOW COULD WE WALK WITH YOU OVER MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS TILL WE REACHED A LAND WHERE THE SUN'S RAYS NO LONGER BURN
7046-80695-0020 WHY BEFORE THE DAY WAS OUT WE SHOULD ALL THREE BE DEAD OF FATIGUE AND HUNGER NO OUR ONLY HOPE LIES IN OUR WINGS AND ALAS YOU CANNOT FLY NO
7046-80695-0021 I CANNOT FLY OF COURSE ANSWERED THE TURTLE WITH A SIGH BUT YOU ARE SO CLEVER AND HAVE SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD SURELY YOU CAN THINK OF SOME PLAN AND HE FIXED HIS EYES EAGERLY ON THEM
7046-80695-0022 THOUGH HE COULD NOT HEAR WHAT THEY SAID THE TURTLE COULD WATCH AND THE HALF HOUR THAT THEIR TALK LASTED FELT TO HIM LIKE A HUNDRED YEARS AT LENGTH HE BEHELD THEM RETURNING SIDE BY SIDE
7046-80695-0023 AND SO GREAT WAS HIS ANXIETY TO KNOW HIS FATE HE ALMOST DIED FROM EXCITEMENT BEFORE THEY REACHED HIM WE HOPE WE HAVE FOUND A PLAN THAT MAY DO FOR YOU SAID THE BIG DUCK GRAVELY BUT WE MUST WARN YOU THAT IT IS NOT WITHOUT GREAT DANGER
7046-80695-0024 ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL TO FOLLOW OUR DIRECTIONS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD NOT FOLLOW YOUR DIRECTIONS WHEN MY LIFE AND HAPPINESS ARE AT STAKE ASKED THE TURTLE JOYFULLY TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE
7046-80695-0025 WELL THEN ANSWERED THE DUCK WHILST WE ARE CARRYING YOU THROUGH THE AIR
7046-80695-0026 HOWEVER HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF YOU MUST NOT FEEL AFRAID NOR MOVE YOUR FEET NOR OPEN YOUR MOUTH NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE OR HEAR IT IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDFUL FOR YOU TO BE PERFECTLY STILL
7046-80695-0027 OR I CANNOT ANSWER FOR THE CONSEQUENCES I WILL BE ABSOLUTELY OBEDIENT ANSWERED THE TURTLE NOT ONLY ON THIS OCCASION BUT DURING ALL MY LIFE AND ONCE MORE I PROMISE FAITHFULLY NOT TO MOVE HEAD OR FOOT
7046-80695-0028 TO FEAR NOTHING AND NEVER TO SPEAK A WORD DURING THE WHOLE JOURNEY THIS BEING SETTLED THE DUCKS SWAM ABOUT TILL THEY FOUND FLOATING IN THE LAKE A GOOD STOUT STICK
7046-80695-0029 THIS THEY TIED TO THEIR NECKS WITH SOME OF THE TOUGH WATER LILY ROOTS AND RETURNED AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD TO THE TURTLE NOW SAID THE ELDER DUCK PUSHING THE STICK GENTLY TOWARDS HIS FRIEND TAKE THIS STICK FIRMLY IN YOUR MOUTH
7046-80695-0030 AND DO NOT LET IT GO TILL WE HAVE SET YOU DOWN ON EARTH AGAIN THE TURTLE DID AS HE WAS TOLD
7046-80695-0031 SPREAD THEIR WINGS AND MOUNTED SWIFTLY INTO THE AIR THE TURTLE HANGING BETWEEN THEM FOR A WHILE ALL WENT WELL THEY SWEPT ACROSS VALLEYS OVER GREAT MOUNTAINS ABOVE RUINED CITIES
7046-80695-0032 BUT NO LAKE WAS TO BE SEEN ANYWHERE STILL THE TURTLE HAD FAITH IN HIS FRIENDS AND BRAVELY HUNG ON TO THE STICK AT LENGTH THEY SAW IN THE DISTANCE A SMALL VILLAGE AND VERY SOON THEY WERE PASSING OVER THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES
7046-80695-0033 THE PEOPLE WERE SO ASTONISHED AT THE STRANGE SIGHT THAT THEY ALL MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN RAN OUT TO SEE IT AND CRIED TO EACH OTHER LOOK LOOK BEHOLD A MIRACLE TWO DUCKS SUPPORTING A TURTLE
7046-80695-0034 WAS EVER SUCH A THING KNOWN BEFORE INDEED SO GREAT WAS THE SURPRISE THAT MEN LEFT THEIR PLOUGHING AND WOMEN THEIR WEAVING IN ORDER TO ADD THEIR VOICES TO THEIR FRIENDS THE DUCKS FLEW STEADILY ON HEEDING NOTHING OF THE COMMOTION BELOW
7046-80695-0035 BUT NOT SO THE TURTLE AT FIRST HE KEPT SILENCE AS HE HAD BEEN BIDDEN TO DO BUT AT LENGTH THE CLAMOUR BELOW PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT EVERYONE WAS ENVYING HIM THE POWER OF TRAVELLING THROUGH THE AIR
7046-80695-0036 AND OPENED HIS MOUTH TO REPLY BUT BEFORE HE COULD UTTER A WORD HE WAS RUSHING SO SWIFTLY THROUGH THE AIR THAT HE QUICKLY BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND IN THIS STATE WAS DASHED TO PIECES AGAINST THE SIDE OF A HOUSE
7046-80695-0037 THEN THE DUCKS LET FALL AFTER HIM THE STICK THAT HAD HELD UP THEIR FRIEND AND WHICH WAS OF NO FURTHER USE SADLY THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SHOOK THEIR HEADS
7046-80695-0038 CERTAINLY THIS DEATH WAS BETTER THAN THE ONE WHICH AWAITED HIM
