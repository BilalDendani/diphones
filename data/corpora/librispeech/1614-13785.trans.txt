1614-13785-0000 DUSK WAS FALLING WHEN WE MADE OUR WAY IN THE DIRECTION OF MAPLE COTTAGE NAYLAND SMITH APPEARED TO BE KEENLY INTERESTED IN THE CHARACTER OF THE DISTRICT
1614-13785-0001 LATER IT GAVE PLACE TO A RICKETY FENCE MY FRIEND PEERED THROUGH A GAP IN THE LATTER THERE IS QUITE AN EXTENSIVE ESTATE HERE HE SAID NOT YET CUT UP BY THE BUILDER IT IS WELL WOODED ON ONE SIDE AND THERE APPEARS TO BE A POOL LOWER DOWN
1614-13785-0002 THE ROAD WAS A QUIET ONE AND WE PLAINLY HEARD THE TREAD QUITE UNMISTAKABLE OF AN APPROACHING POLICEMAN
1614-13785-0003 DOES THIS PIECE OF GROUND EXTEND DOWN TO THE VILLAGE CONSTABLE HE INQUIRED QUITE WILLING FOR A CHAT THE MAN STOPPED AND STOOD WITH HIS THUMBS THRUST IN HIS BELT YES SIR THEY TELL ME THREE NEW ROADS WILL BE MADE THROUGH IT BETWEEN HERE AND THE HILL
1614-13785-0004 IT MUST BE A HAPPY HUNTING GROUND FOR TRAMPS I'VE SEEN SOME SUSPICIOUS LOOKING COVES ABOUT AT TIMES BUT AFTER DUSK AN ARMY MIGHT BE INSIDE THERE AND NOBODY WOULD EVER BE THE WISER BURGLARIES FREQUENT IN THE HOUSES BACKING ON TO IT OH NO
1614-13785-0005 A FAVORITE GAME IN THESE PARTS IS SNATCHING LOAVES AND BOTTLES OF MILK FROM THE DOORS FIRST THING AS THEY'RE DELIVERED THERE'S BEEN AN EXTRA LOT OF IT LATELY MY MATE WHO RELIEVES ME HAS GOT SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS TO KEEP HIS EYE OPEN IN THE MORNINGS THE MAN GRINNED
1614-13785-0006 IT WOULDN'T BE A VERY BIG CASE EVEN IF HE CAUGHT ANYBODY NO SAID SMITH ABSENTLY PERHAPS NOT
1614-13785-0007 GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT SIR REPLIED THE CONSTABLE RICHER BY HALF A CROWN AND THANK YOU SMITH STARED AFTER HIM FOR A MOMENT TUGGING REFLECTIVELY AT THE LOBE OF HIS EAR I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE A BIG CASE AFTER ALL HE MURMURED
1614-13785-0008 COME ON PETRIE NOT ANOTHER WORD DID HE SPEAK UNTIL WE STOOD AT THE GATE OF MAPLE COTTAGE THERE A PLAIN CLOTHES MAN WAS STANDING EVIDENTLY AWAITING SMITH HE TOUCHED HIS HAT HAVE YOU FOUND A SUITABLE HIDING PLACE ASKED MY COMPANION RAPIDLY

1614-13785-0010 YOU HAD BETTER RUN UP AND SEE THE PATIENT ACCORDINGLY I FOLLOWED WEYMOUTH UPSTAIRS AND WAS ADMITTED BY HIS WIFE TO A NEAT LITTLE BEDROOM WHERE THE GRIEF STRICKEN WOMAN LAY A WANLY PATHETIC SIGHT DID YOU ADMINISTER THE DRAUGHT AS DIRECTED I ASKED
1614-13785-0011 MISSUS JAMES WEYMOUTH NODDED SHE WAS A KINDLY LOOKING WOMAN WITH THE SAME DREAD HAUNTING HER HAZEL EYES AS THAT WHICH LURKED IN HER HUSBAND'S BLUE ONES THE PATIENT WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY SOME WHISPERED INSTRUCTIONS I GAVE TO THE FAITHFUL NURSE
1614-13785-0012 AND DESCENDED TO THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS A WARM NIGHT AND WEYMOUTH SAT BY THE OPEN WINDOW SMOKING THE DIM LIGHT FROM THE LAMP ON THE TABLE LENT HIM AN ALMOST STARTLING LIKENESS TO HIS BROTHER AND FOR A MOMENT I STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS SCARCE ABLE TO TRUST MY REASON
1614-13785-0013 THEN HE TURNED HIS FACE FULLY TOWARDS ME AND THE ILLUSION WAS LOST DO YOU THINK SHE IS LIKELY TO WAKE DOCTOR HE ASKED I THINK NOT I REPLIED NAYLAND SMITH STOOD UPON THE RUG BEFORE THE HEARTH
1614-13785-0014 SWINGING FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER IN HIS NERVOUSLY RESTLESS WAY THE ROOM WAS FOGGY WITH THE FUMES OF TOBACCO FOR HE TOO WAS SMOKING AT INTERVALS OF SOME FIVE TO TEN MINUTES HIS BLACKENED BRIAR WHICH I NEVER KNEW HIM TO CLEAN OR SCRAPE WOULD GO OUT
1614-13785-0015 THE TOBACCO HABIT IS INFECTIOUS AND SEATING MYSELF IN AN ARM CHAIR I LIGHTED A CIGARETTE
1614-13785-0016 I SETTLED DOWN TO WORK UPON MY RECORD OF THE FU MANCHU CASE SILENCE FELL UPON MAPLE COTTAGE SAVE FOR THE SHUDDERING SIGH WHICH WHISPERED THROUGH THE OVER HANGING CEDARS AND SMITH'S ETERNAL MATCH STRIKING
1614-13785-0017 YET I COULD MAKE LITTLE PROGRESS
1614-13785-0018 THIS WAS THE SENTENCE IMAGINE A PERSON TALL LEAN AND FELINE HIGH SHOULDERED WITH A BROW LIKE SHAKESPEARE AND A FACE LIKE SATAN A CLOSE SHAVEN SKULL AND LONG MAGNETIC EYES OF THE TRUE CAT GREEN
1614-13785-0019 INVEST HIM WITH ALL THE CRUEL CUNNING OF AN ENTIRE EASTERN RACE ACCUMULATED IN ONE GIANT INTELLECT DOCTOR FU MANCHU FU MANCHU AS SMITH HAD DESCRIBED HIM TO ME ON THAT NIGHT WHICH NOW SEEMED SO REMOTELY DISTANT
1614-13785-0020 THE NIGHT UPON WHICH I HAD LEARNED OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE WONDERFUL AND EVIL BEING BORN OF THAT SECRET QUICKENING
1614-13785-0021 AS SMITH FOR THE NINTH OR TENTH TIME KNOCKED OUT HIS PIPE ON A BAR OF THE GRATE THE CUCKOO CLOCK IN THE KITCHEN PROCLAIMED THE HOUR TWO SAID JAMES WEYMOUTH I ABANDONED MY TASK
1614-13785-0022 REPLACING NOTES AND WRITING BLOCK IN THE BAG THAT I HAD WITH ME WEYMOUTH ADJUSTED THE LAMP WHICH HAD BEGUN TO SMOKE I TIPTOED TO THE STAIRS AND STEPPING SOFTLY ASCENDED TO THE SICK ROOM ALL WAS QUIET AND MISSUS WEYMOUTH WHISPERED TO ME THAT THE PATIENT STILL SLEPT SOUNDLY
1614-13785-0023 I RETURNED TO FIND NAYLAND SMITH PACING ABOUT THE ROOM IN THAT STATE OF SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT HABITUAL WITH HIM IN THE APPROACH OF ANY CRISIS AT A QUARTER PAST TWO THE BREEZE DROPPED ENTIRELY
1614-13785-0024 AND SUCH A STILLNESS REIGNED ALL ABOUT US AS I COULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED POSSIBLE SO NEAR TO THE EVER THROBBING HEART OF THE GREAT METROPOLIS PLAINLY I COULD HEAR WEYMOUTH'S HEAVY BREATHING HE SAT AT THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE BLACK SHADOWS UNDER THE CEDARS
1614-13785-0025 HE WAS LISTENING I DOUBT NOT WE WERE ALL LISTENING SOME FAINT SOUND BROKE THE IMPRESSIVE STILLNESS
1614-13785-0026 BRIEF AND UPON IT ENSUED A SILENCE MORE MARKED THAN EVER SOME MINUTES BEFORE SMITH HAD EXTINGUISHED THE LAMP IN THE DARKNESS I HEARD HIS TEETH SNAP SHARPLY TOGETHER THE CALL OF AN OWL SOUNDED VERY CLEARLY THREE TIMES
1614-13785-0027 KNOWING HIM TO BE IN THAT HIGH STRUNG AND SOMEWHAT IRRITABLE MOOD WHICH CLAIMED HIM AT TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY WHEN HE DOUBTED THE WISDOM OF HIS ACTIONS
1614-13785-0028 HE GAVE NO SIGN VERY FAINTLY I HEARD A CLOCK STRIKE THE HALF HOUR A SOFT BREEZE STOLE AGAIN THROUGH THE BRANCHES ABOVE THE WIND I THOUGHT MUST BE IN A NEW QUARTER
1614-13785-0029 IN SO LONELY A SPOT
1614-13785-0030 YET SUCH WAS THE FACT AND HARD UPON THE RINGING FOLLOWED ANOTHER SOUND
1614-13785-0031 BUT AT WHOSE COMING NO ONE OF US I THINK RETAINED COMPLETE MASTERY OF HIMSELF BREAKING UP THE SILENCE IN A MANNER THAT SET MY HEART WILDLY LEAPING IT CAME AN IMPERATIVE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR MY GOD GROANED WEYMOUTH
1614-13785-0032 BUT HE DID NOT MOVE FROM HIS POSITION AT THE WINDOW STAND BY PETRIE SAID SMITH HE STRODE TO THE DOOR AND THREW IT WIDELY OPEN
1614-13785-0033 I THINK I CRIED OUT AS I FELL BACK RETREATED WITH CLENCHED HANDS FROM BEFORE THAT WHICH STOOD ON THE THRESHOLD IT WAS A WILD UNKEMPT FIGURE WITH STRAGGLING BEARD HIDEOUSLY STARING EYES WITH ITS HANDS IT CLUTCHED AT ITS HAIR AT ITS CHIN
1614-13785-0034 PLUCKED AT ITS MOUTH NO MOONLIGHT TOUCHED THE FEATURES OF THIS UNEARTHLY VISITANT BUT SCANTY AS WAS THE ILLUMINATION WE COULD SEE THE GLEAMING TEETH AND THE WILDLY GLARING EYES IT BEGAN TO LAUGH PEAL AFTER PEAL
1614-13785-0035 HIDEOUS AND SHRILL NOTHING SO TERRIFYING HAD EVER SMOTE UPON MY EARS I WAS PALSIED BY THE HORROR OF THE SOUND THEN NAYLAND SMITH PRESSED THE BUTTON OF AN ELECTRIC TORCH WHICH HE CARRIED
1614-13785-0036 HE DIRECTED THE DISK OF WHITE LIGHT FULLY UPON THE FACE IN THE DOORWAY OH GOD CRIED WEYMOUTH IT'S JOHN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN OH GOD OH GOD PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I REALLY BELIEVED
1614-13785-0037 NAY I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT A THING OF ANOTHER WORLD STOOD BEFORE ME I AM ASHAMED TO CONFESS THE EXTENT OF THE HORROR THAT CAME UPON ME JAMES WEYMOUTH RAISED HIS HANDS AS IF TO THRUST AWAY FROM HIM THAT AWFUL THING IN THE DOOR HE WAS BABBLING PRAYERS I THINK
1614-13785-0038 HE LEAPED FORWARD AND IN THE INSTANT THAT HE GRAPPLED WITH THE ONE WHO HAD KNOCKED I KNEW THE VISITANT FOR A MAN OF FLESH AND BLOOD A MAN WHO SHRIEKED AND FOUGHT LIKE A SAVAGE ANIMAL FOAMED AT THE MOUTH AND GNASHED HIS TEETH IN HORRID FRENZY KNEW HIM FOR A MADMAN
1614-13785-0039 KNEW HIM FOR THE VICTIM OF FU MANCHU NOT DEAD BUT LIVING FOR INSPECTOR WEYMOUTH A MANIAC IN A FLASH I REALIZED ALL THIS
1614-13785-0040 AND THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING OUTSIDE CAME RUNNING INTO THE PORCH A THIRD WAS WITH THEM AND THE FIVE OF US FOR WEYMOUTH'S BROTHER HAD NOT YET GRASPED THE FACT THAT A MAN AND NOT A SPIRIT SHRIEKED AND HOWLED IN OUR MIDST CLUNG TO THE INFURIATED MADMAN YET BARELY HELD OUR OWN WITH HIM
1614-13785-0041 THE SYRINGE PETRIE GASPED SMITH QUICK YOU MUST MANAGE TO MAKE AN INJECTION I EXTRICATED MYSELF AND RACED INTO THE COTTAGE FOR MY BAG
1614-13785-0042 EVEN IN THAT THRILLING MOMENT I COULD FIND TIME TO ADMIRE THE WONDERFUL FORESIGHT OF MY FRIEND
1614-13785-0043 LAY PASSIVE UPON THE COUCH IN HIS OWN SITTING ROOM A GREAT WONDER POSSESSED MY MIND FOR THE GENIUS OF THE UNCANNY BEING WHO WITH THE SCRATCH OF A NEEDLE HAD MADE A BRAVE AND KINDLY MAN INTO THIS UNCLEAN BRUTISH THING
1614-13785-0044 NAYLAND SMITH GAUNT AND WILD EYED AND TREMBLING YET WITH HIS TREMENDOUS EXERTIONS TURNED TO THE MAN WHOM I KNEW TO BE THE MESSENGER FROM SCOTLAND YARD WELL HE RAPPED HE IS ARRESTED SIR THE DETECTIVE REPORTED
1614-13785-0045 HAS SHE SLEPT THROUGH IT SAID SMITH TO ME
