2882-147159-0019 IT'S VERY HARD TO KEEP UP ONE'S HEART I WISH I WERE A BOY I'D GO TO SEA WITH YOU IT WOULD BE GETTING AWAY FROM BAD NEWS AT ANY RATE AND NOW THERE'S HARDLY A CREATURE THAT CROSSES THE DOOR STEP BUT HAS SOMETHING SAD AND UNHAPPY TO TELL ONE
2882-147159-0020 FATHER IS GOING AS A DELEGATE FROM HIS UNION TO ASK HELP FROM THE GLASGOW FOLK HE'S STARTING THIS EVENING MARY SIGHED FOR THE FEELING AGAIN CAME OVER HER THAT IT WAS VERY FLAT TO BE LEFT ALONE
2882-147159-0021 YOU SAY NO ONE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD BUT HAS SOMETHING SAD TO SAY YOU DON'T MEAN THAT MARGARET JENNINGS HAS ANY TROUBLE ASKED THE YOUNG SAILOR ANXIOUSLY NO REPLIED MARY SMILING A LITTLE
2882-147159-0022 SHE'S THE ONLY ONE I KNOW I BELIEVE WHO SEEMS FREE FROM CARE HER BLINDNESS ALMOST APPEARS A BLESSING SOMETIMES SHE WAS SO DOWNHEARTED WHEN SHE DREADED IT AND NOW SHE SEEMS SO CALM AND HAPPY WHEN IT'S DOWNRIGHT COME
2882-147159-0023 NO MARGARET'S HAPPY I DO THINK I COULD ALMOST WISH IT HAD BEEN OTHERWISE SAID WILL THOUGHTFULLY I COULD HAVE BEEN SO GLAD TO COMFORT HER AND CHERISH HER IF SHE HAD BEEN IN TROUBLE
2882-147159-0024 OH I DON'T KNOW SHE SEEMS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I AM AND HER VOICE WHEN I HEAR IT AND THINK OF THE WISHES THAT ARE IN MY HEART IT SEEMS AS MUCH OUT OF PLACE TO ASK HER TO BE MY WIFE
2882-147159-0025 AS IT WOULD BE TO ASK AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN MARY COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING OUTRIGHT IN SPITE OF HER DEPRESSION AT THE IDEA OF MARGARET AS AN ANGEL IT WAS SO DIFFICULT EVEN TO HER DRESS MAKING IMAGINATION
2882-147159-0026 TO FANCY WHERE AND HOW THE WINGS WOULD BE FASTENED TO THE BROWN STUFF GOWN OR THE BLUE AND YELLOW PRINT WILL LAUGHED TOO A LITTLE OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH MARY'S PRETTY MERRY LAUGH THEN HE SAID
2882-147159-0027 AY YOU MAY LAUGH MARY IT ONLY SHOWS YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE IN AN INSTANT MARY WAS CARNATION COLOUR AND THE TEARS SPRANG TO HER SOFT GRAY EYES
2882-147159-0028 IT WAS UNKIND OF HIM HE DID NOT NOTICE HER CHANGE OF LOOK AND OF COMPLEXION HE ONLY NOTICED THAT SHE WAS SILENT SO HE CONTINUED I THOUGHT I THINK THAT WHEN I COME BACK FROM THIS VOYAGE I WILL SPEAK
2882-147159-0029 IT'S MY FOURTH VOYAGE IN THE SAME SHIP AND WITH THE SAME CAPTAIN AND HE'S PROMISED HE'LL MAKE ME SECOND MATE AFTER THIS TRIP THEN I SHALL HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER MARGARET AND HER GRANDFATHER AND AUNT ALICE SHALL LIVE WITH HER
2882-147159-0030 I'M SPEAKING AS IF SHE CARED FOR ME AND WOULD MARRY ME D'YE THINK SHE DOES CARE AT ALL FOR ME MARY ASKED HE ANXIOUSLY MARY HAD A VERY DECIDED OPINION OF HER OWN ON THE SUBJECT BUT SHE DID NOT FEEL AS IF SHE HAD ANY RIGHT TO GIVE IT
2882-147159-0031 SO SHE SAID YOU MUST ASK MARGARET NOT ME WILL SHE'S NEVER NAMED YOUR NAME TO ME HIS COUNTENANCE FELL BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT WAS A GOOD SIGN FROM A GIRL LIKE HER I'VE NO RIGHT TO SAY WHAT I THINK
2882-147159-0032 BUT IF I WAS YOU I WOULD NOT LEAVE HER NOW WITHOUT SPEAKING NO I CANNOT SPEAK I HAVE TRIED I'VE BEEN IN TO WISH THEM GOOD BYE AND MY VOICE STUCK IN MY THROAT I COULD SAY NOUGHT OF WHAT I'D PLANNED TO SAY
2882-147159-0033 AND I NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING SO BOLD AS TO OFFER HER MARRIAGE TILL I'D BEEN MY NEXT TRIP AND BEEN MADE MATE I COULD NOT EVEN OFFER HER THIS BOX SAID HE UNDOING HIS PAPER PARCEL AND DISPLAYING A GAUDILY ORNAMENTED ACCORDION
2882-147159-0034 I LONGED TO BUY HER SOMETHING AND I THOUGHT IF IT WERE SOMETHING IN THE MUSIC LINE SHE WOULD MAY BE FANCY IT MORE SO WILL YOU GIVE IT TO HER MARY WHEN I'M GONE AND IF YOU CAN SLIP IN SOMETHING TENDER SOMETHING

2882-147159-0036 I WONDER IF SHE WILL EVER THINK ON ME WHEN THE WIND IS WHISTLING AND THE GALE RISING YOU'LL OFTEN SPEAK OF ME TO HER MARY AND IF I SHOULD MEET WITH ANY MISCHANCE TELL HER HOW DEAR HOW VERY DEAR SHE WAS TO ME

2882-147159-0039 AND FOR AS TIRED AS EVER SHE MIGHT BE SHE WOULD BE UP AND DRESSED IN A TWINKLING NEVER THINKING OF THE HARD DAY'S WASH AFORE HER NEXT MORNING THEM WERE HAPPY TIMES HOW PLEASED I USED TO BE WHEN SHE WOULD TAKE ME INTO THE FIELDS WITH HER TO GATHER HERBS
2882-147159-0040 I'VE TASTED TEA IN CHINA SINCE THEN BUT IT WASN'T HALF SO GOOD AS THE HERB TEA SHE USED TO MAKE FOR ME O SUNDAY NIGHTS AND SHE KNEW SUCH A DEAL ABOUT PLANTS AND BIRDS AND THEIR WAYS SHE USED TO TELL ME LONG STORIES ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD

2882-147159-0046 SUDDENLY MARY STARTED THAT'S FATHER'S STEP AND HIS SHIRT'S NOT READY SHE HURRIED TO HER IRONS AND TRIED TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME JOHN BARTON CAME IN SUCH A HAGGARD AND WILDLY ANXIOUS LOOKING MAN
2882-147159-0047 WILL THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER SEEN HE LOOKED AT WILL BUT SPOKE NO WORD OF GREETING OR WELCOME
2882-147159-0048 YOU'LL THINK ON ME ON TUESDAY MARY THAT'S THE DAY WE SHALL HOIST OUR BLUE PETER JACK HARRIS SAYS MARY WAS HEARTILY SORRY WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED IT SEEMED LIKE SHUTTING OUT A FRIENDLY SUNBEAM AND HER FATHER
2882-147159-0049 WHAT COULD BE THE MATTER WITH HIM HE WAS SO RESTLESS NOT SPEAKING SHE WISHED HE WOULD BUT STARTING UP AND THEN SITTING DOWN AND MEDDLING WITH HER IRONS HE SEEMED SO FIERCE TOO TO JUDGE FROM HIS FACE
2882-147159-0050 SHE WONDERED IF HE DISLIKED WILL BEING THERE OR IF HE WERE VEXED TO FIND THAT SHE HAD NOT GOT FURTHER ON WITH HER WORK AT LAST SHE COULD BEAR HIS NERVOUS WAY NO LONGER IT MADE HER EQUALLY NERVOUS AND FIDGETTY SHE WOULD SPEAK

2882-147159-0053 SHE FINISHED HER BIT OF IRONING AND BEGAN PREPARING THE FOOD SHE WAS SURE HER FATHER NEEDED FOR BY THIS TIME HER EXPERIENCE IN THE DEGREES OF HUNGER HAD TAUGHT HER THAT HIS PRESENT IRRITABILITY WAS INCREASED IF NOT CAUSED BY WANT OF FOOD
2882-147159-0054 AND OUT OF THIS HE HAD GIVEN MARY A FEW SHILLINGS IN THE MORNING SO SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO BUY A SUFFICIENT MEAL AND NOW HER CARE WAS TO COOK IT
2882-147159-0055 IF THOU'RT DOING THAT FOR ME MARY THOU MAY'ST SPARE THY LABOUR I TELLED THEE I WERE NOT FOR EATING JUST A LITTLE BIT FATHER BEFORE STARTING COAXED MARY PERSEVERINGLY
2882-147159-0056 MARY KNEW FROM PAST EXPERIENCE THEY WERE ANY THING BUT SHORT HER FATHER'S COUNTENANCE FELL BACK INTO THE DEEP GLOOM FROM WHICH IT WAS BUT JUST EMERGING AT THE SOUND OF MARY'S SWEET VOICE AND PRETTY PLEADING HE BECAME AGAIN RESTLESS AND FIDGETTY
2882-147159-0057 IN HIS OWN HOUSE JOB HOWEVER DID NOT STAND UPON CEREMONY HE HAD COME TO PAY A VISIT AND WAS NOT TO BE DAUNTED FROM HIS PURPOSE HE WAS INTERESTED IN JOHN BARTON'S MISSION TO GLASGOW AND WANTED TO HEAR ALL ABOUT IT

2882-147159-0078 HER FATHER AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT SLACKENED HIS PACE AND FELL INTO THAT HEAVY LISTLESS STEP WHICH TOLD AS WELL AS WORDS COULD DO OF HOPELESSNESS AND WEAKNESS IT WAS GETTING DARK BUT HE LOITERED ON
2882-147159-0079 RETURNING NO GREETING TO ANY ONE A CHILD'S CRY CAUGHT HIS EAR HIS THOUGHTS WERE RUNNING ON LITTLE TOM ON THE DEAD AND BURIED CHILD OF HAPPIER YEARS HE FOLLOWED THE SOUND OF THE WAIL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS
2882-147159-0080 AND FOUND A POOR LITTLE MORTAL WHO HAD LOST HIS WAY AND WHOSE GRIEF HAD CHOKED UP HIS THOUGHTS TO THE SINGLE WANT MAMMY MAMMY WITH TENDER ADDRESS JOHN BARTON SOOTHED THE LITTLE LADDIE AND WITH BEAUTIFUL PATIENCE
2882-147159-0081 HE GATHERED FRAGMENTS OF MEANING FROM THE HALF SPOKEN WORDS WHICH CAME MINGLED WITH SOBS FROM THE TERRIFIED LITTLE HEART SO AIDED BY INQUIRIES HERE AND THERE FROM A PASSER BY HE LED AND CARRIED THE LITTLE FELLOW HOME WHERE HIS MOTHER HAD BEEN
2882-147159-0082 TOO BUSY TO MISS HIM BUT NOW RECEIVED HIM WITH THANKFULNESS AND WITH AN ELOQUENT IRISH BLESSING WHEN JOHN HEARD THE WORDS OF BLESSING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY AND TURNED AWAY TO RETRACE HIS STEPS LET US LEAVE HIM
2882-147159-0083 MARY TOOK HER SEWING AFTER HE HAD GONE AND SAT ON AND SAT ON
2882-147159-0084 SHE HAD CONQUERED HER FEELING OF IMPATIENCE TOWARDS HIM SO FAR AS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER HIM HER FATHER'S REJECTED SUPPER AND SHE EVEN TRIED TO EAT HERSELF BUT HER HEART FAILED HER A LEADEN WEIGHT SEEMED TO HANG OVER HER
2882-147159-0085 A SORT OF PRESENTIMENT OF EVIL OR PERHAPS ONLY AN EXCESS OF LOW SPIRITED FEELING IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE TWO DEPARTURES WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE THAT AFTERNOON
