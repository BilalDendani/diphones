3361-1133-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE ELIZABETH WAS SITTING WITH HER MOTHER AND SISTERS REFLECTING ON WHAT SHE HAD HEARD AND DOUBTING WHETHER SHE WAS AUTHORISED TO MENTION IT WHEN SIR WILLIAM LUCAS HIMSELF APPEARED SENT BY HIS DAUGHTER
3361-1133-0001 TO ANNOUNCE HER ENGAGEMENT TO THE FAMILY WITH MANY COMPLIMENTS TO THEM AND MUCH SELF GRATULATION ON THE PROSPECT OF A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HOUSES HE UNFOLDED THE MATTER TO AN AUDIENCE NOT MERELY WONDERING BUT INCREDULOUS
3361-1133-0002 FOR MISSUS BENNET WITH MORE PERSEVERANCE THAN POLITENESS PROTESTED HE MUST BE ENTIRELY MISTAKEN AND LYDIA ALWAYS UNGUARDED AND OFTEN UNCIVIL BOISTEROUSLY EXCLAIMED
3361-1133-0003 GOOD LORD SIR WILLIAM HOW CAN YOU TELL SUCH A STORY DO NOT YOU KNOW THAT MISTER COLLINS WANTS TO MARRY LIZZY NOTHING LESS THAN THE COMPLAISANCE OF A COURTIER COULD HAVE BORNE WITHOUT ANGER SUCH TREATMENT
3361-1133-0004 BUT SIR WILLIAM'S GOOD BREEDING CARRIED HIM THROUGH IT ALL AND THOUGH HE BEGGED LEAVE TO BE POSITIVE AS TO THE TRUTH OF HIS INFORMATION HE LISTENED TO ALL THEIR IMPERTINENCE WITH THE MOST FORBEARING COURTESY ELIZABETH
3361-1133-0005 FEELING IT INCUMBENT ON HER TO RELIEVE HIM FROM SO UNPLEASANT A SITUATION NOW PUT HERSELF FORWARD TO CONFIRM HIS ACCOUNT BY MENTIONING HER PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF IT FROM CHARLOTTE HERSELF
3361-1133-0006 AND ENDEAVOURED TO PUT A STOP TO THE EXCLAMATIONS OF HER MOTHER AND SISTERS BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HER CONGRATULATIONS TO SIR WILLIAM IN WHICH SHE WAS READILY JOINED BY JANE
3361-1133-0007 AND BY MAKING A VARIETY OF REMARKS ON THE HAPPINESS THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE MATCH THE EXCELLENT CHARACTER OF MISTER COLLINS AND THE CONVENIENT DISTANCE OF HUNSFORD FROM LONDON
3361-1133-0008 MISSUS BENNET WAS IN FACT TOO MUCH OVERPOWERED TO SAY A GREAT DEAL WHILE SIR WILLIAM REMAINED BUT NO SOONER HAD HE LEFT THEM THAN HER FEELINGS FOUND A RAPID VENT IN THE FIRST PLACE
3361-1133-0009 SHE PERSISTED IN DISBELIEVING THE WHOLE OF THE MATTER SECONDLY SHE WAS VERY SURE THAT MISTER COLLINS HAD BEEN TAKEN IN THIRDLY SHE TRUSTED THAT THEY WOULD NEVER BE HAPPY TOGETHER AND FOURTHLY
3361-1133-0010 THAT THE MATCH MIGHT BE BROKEN OFF TWO INFERENCES HOWEVER WERE PLAINLY DEDUCED FROM THE WHOLE ONE THAT ELIZABETH WAS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE MISCHIEF
3361-1133-0011 AND THE OTHER THAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN BARBAROUSLY MISUSED BY THEM ALL AND ON THESE TWO POINTS SHE PRINCIPALLY DWELT DURING THE REST OF THE DAY NOTHING COULD CONSOLE AND NOTHING COULD APPEASE HER
3361-1133-0012 NOR DID THAT DAY WEAR OUT HER RESENTMENT A WEEK ELAPSED BEFORE SHE COULD SEE ELIZABETH WITHOUT SCOLDING HER A MONTH PASSED AWAY BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK TO SIR WILLIAM OR LADY LUCAS WITHOUT BEING RUDE
3361-1133-0013 AND MANY MONTHS WERE GONE BEFORE SHE COULD AT ALL FORGIVE THEIR DAUGHTER MISTER BENNET'S EMOTIONS WERE MUCH MORE TRANQUIL ON THE OCCASION AND SUCH AS HE DID EXPERIENCE HE PRONOUNCED TO BE OF A MOST AGREEABLE SORT
3361-1133-0014 FOR IT GRATIFIED HIM HE SAID TO DISCOVER THAT CHARLOTTE LUCAS WHOM HE HAD BEEN USED TO THINK TOLERABLY SENSIBLE WAS AS FOOLISH AS HIS WIFE AND MORE FOOLISH THAN HIS DAUGHTER
3361-1133-0015 JANE CONFESSED HERSELF A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE MATCH BUT SHE SAID LESS OF HER ASTONISHMENT THAN OF HER EARNEST DESIRE FOR THEIR HAPPINESS NOR COULD ELIZABETH PERSUADE HER TO CONSIDER IT AS IMPROBABLE
3361-1133-0016 KITTY AND LYDIA WERE FAR FROM ENVYING MISS LUCAS FOR MISTER COLLINS WAS ONLY A CLERGYMAN AND IT AFFECTED THEM IN NO OTHER WAY THAN AS A PIECE OF NEWS TO SPREAD AT MERYTON
3361-1133-0017 LADY LUCAS COULD NOT BE INSENSIBLE OF TRIUMPH ON BEING ABLE TO RETORT ON MISSUS BENNET THE COMFORT OF HAVING A DAUGHTER WELL MARRIED AND SHE CALLED AT LONGBOURN RATHER OFTENER THAN USUAL TO SAY HOW HAPPY SHE WAS
3361-1133-0018 THOUGH MISSUS BENNET'S SOUR LOOKS AND ILL NATURED REMARKS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO DRIVE HAPPINESS AWAY BETWEEN ELIZABETH AND CHARLOTTE THERE WAS A RESTRAINT WHICH KEPT THEM MUTUALLY SILENT ON THE SUBJECT
3361-1133-0019 HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN CHARLOTTE MADE HER TURN WITH FONDER REGARD TO HER SISTER OF WHOSE RECTITUDE AND DELICACY SHE WAS SURE HER OPINION COULD NEVER BE SHAKEN AND FOR WHOSE HAPPINESS SHE GREW DAILY MORE ANXIOUS
3361-1133-0020 AS BINGLEY HAD NOW BEEN GONE A WEEK AND NOTHING MORE WAS HEARD OF HIS RETURN JANE HAD SENT CAROLINE AN EARLY ANSWER TO HER LETTER AND WAS COUNTING THE DAYS TILL SHE MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO HEAR AGAIN
3361-1133-0021 THE PROMISED LETTER OF THANKS FROM MISTER COLLINS ARRIVED ON TUESDAY ADDRESSED TO THEIR FATHER AND WRITTEN WITH ALL THE SOLEMNITY OF GRATITUDE WHICH A TWELVEMONTH'S ABODE IN THE FAMILY MIGHT HAVE PROMPTED
3361-1133-0022 AFTER DISCHARGING HIS CONSCIENCE ON THAT HEAD HE PROCEEDED TO INFORM THEM WITH MANY RAPTUROUS EXPRESSIONS OF HIS HAPPINESS IN HAVING OBTAINED THE AFFECTION OF THEIR AMIABLE NEIGHBOUR MISS LUCAS
3361-1133-0023 THAT HE HAD BEEN SO READY TO CLOSE WITH THEIR KIND WISH OF SEEING HIM AGAIN AT LONGBOURN WHITHER HE HOPED TO BE ABLE TO RETURN ON MONDAY FORTNIGHT FOR LADY CATHERINE HE ADDED SO HEARTILY APPROVED HIS MARRIAGE
3361-1133-0024 THAT SHE WISHED IT TO TAKE PLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WHICH HE TRUSTED WOULD BE AN UNANSWERABLE ARGUMENT WITH HIS AMIABLE CHARLOTTE TO NAME AN EARLY DAY FOR MAKING HIM THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
3361-1133-0025 MISTER COLLINS'S RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE WAS NO LONGER A MATTER OF PLEASURE TO MISSUS BENNET ON THE CONTRARY SHE WAS AS MUCH DISPOSED TO COMPLAIN OF IT AS HER HUSBAND
3361-1133-0026 IT WAS VERY STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD COME TO LONGBOURN INSTEAD OF TO LUCAS LODGE IT WAS ALSO VERY INCONVENIENT AND EXCEEDINGLY TROUBLESOME SHE HATED HAVING VISITORS IN THE HOUSE WHILE HER HEALTH WAS SO INDIFFERENT
3361-1133-0027 AND LOVERS WERE OF ALL PEOPLE THE MOST DISAGREEABLE SUCH WERE THE GENTLE MURMURS OF MISSUS BENNET
3361-1133-0028 NEITHER JANE NOR ELIZABETH WERE COMFORTABLE ON THIS SUBJECT DAY AFTER DAY PASSED AWAY WITHOUT BRINGING ANY OTHER TIDINGS OF HIM THAN THE REPORT WHICH SHORTLY PREVAILED IN MERYTON OF HIS COMING NO MORE TO NETHERFIELD THE WHOLE WINTER
3361-1133-0029 BUT THAT HIS SISTERS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN KEEPING HIM AWAY UNWILLING AS SHE WAS TO ADMIT AN IDEA SO DESTRUCTIVE OF JANE'S HAPPINESS AND SO DISHONORABLE TO THE STABILITY OF HER LOVER SHE COULD NOT PREVENT ITS FREQUENTLY OCCURRING
3361-1133-0030 AS FOR JANE HER ANXIETY UNDER THIS SUSPENSE WAS OF COURSE MORE PAINFUL THAN ELIZABETH'S BUT WHATEVER SHE FELT SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING AND BETWEEN HERSELF AND ELIZABETH THEREFORE
3361-1133-0031 THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER ALLUDED TO BUT AS NO SUCH DELICACY RESTRAINED HER MOTHER AN HOUR SELDOM PASSED IN WHICH SHE DID NOT TALK OF BINGLEY EXPRESS HER IMPATIENCE FOR HIS ARRIVAL
3361-1133-0032 OR EVEN REQUIRE JANE TO CONFESS THAT IF HE DID NOT COME BACK SHE WOULD THINK HERSELF VERY ILL USED IT NEEDED ALL JANE'S STEADY MILDNESS TO BEAR THESE ATTACKS WITH TOLERABLE TRANQUILLITY
3361-1133-0033 MISTER COLLINS RETURNED MOST PUNCTUALLY ON MONDAY FORTNIGHT BUT HIS RECEPTION AT LONGBOURN WAS NOT QUITE SO GRACIOUS AS IT HAD BEEN ON HIS FIRST INTRODUCTION HE WAS TOO HAPPY HOWEVER TO NEED MUCH ATTENTION
3361-1133-0034 AND LUCKILY FOR THE OTHERS THE BUSINESS OF LOVE MAKING RELIEVED THEM FROM A GREAT DEAL OF HIS COMPANY THE CHIEF OF EVERY DAY WAS SPENT BY HIM AT LUCAS LODGE
3361-1133-0035 AND HE SOMETIMES RETURNED TO LONGBOURN ONLY IN TIME TO MAKE AN APOLOGY FOR HIS ABSENCE BEFORE THE FAMILY WENT TO BED MISSUS BENNET WAS REALLY IN A MOST PITIABLE STATE
3361-1133-0036 THE VERY MENTION OF ANYTHING CONCERNING THE MATCH THREW HER INTO AN AGONY OF ILL HUMOUR AND WHEREVER SHE WENT SHE WAS SURE OF HEARING IT TALKED OF THE SIGHT OF MISS LUCAS WAS ODIOUS TO HER
3361-1133-0037 AS HER SUCCESSOR IN THAT HOUSE SHE REGARDED HER WITH JEALOUS ABHORRENCE WHENEVER CHARLOTTE CAME TO SEE THEM SHE CONCLUDED HER TO BE ANTICIPATING THE HOUR OF POSSESSION AND WHENEVER SHE SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISTER COLLINS
3361-1133-0038 AND RESOLVING TO TURN HERSELF AND HER DAUGHTERS OUT OF THE HOUSE AS SOON AS MISTER BENNET WERE DEAD SHE COMPLAINED BITTERLY OF ALL THIS TO HER HUSBAND INDEED MISTER BENNET SAID SHE
3361-1133-0039 IT IS VERY HARD TO THINK THAT CHARLOTTE LUCAS SHOULD EVER BE MISTRESS OF THIS HOUSE THAT I SHOULD BE FORCED TO MAKE WAY FOR HER AND LIVE TO SEE HER TAKE HER PLACE IN IT MY DEAR
3361-1133-0040 DO NOT GIVE WAY TO SUCH GLOOMY THOUGHTS LET US HOPE FOR BETTER THINGS LET US FLATTER OURSELVES THAT I MAY BE THE SURVIVOR THIS WAS NOT VERY CONSOLING TO MISSUS BENNET
3361-1133-0041 INSTEAD OF MAKING ANY ANSWER SHE WENT ON AS BEFORE I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE ALL THIS ESTATE IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE ENTAIL I SHOULD NOT MIND IT WHAT SHOULD NOT YOU MIND
3361-1133-0042 I SHOULD NOT MIND ANYTHING AT ALL LET US BE THANKFUL THAT YOU ARE PRESERVED FROM A STATE OF SUCH INSENSIBILITY
