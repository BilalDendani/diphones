1311-134176-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN STAR SURGEON IT WAS AMAZING TO DAL TIMGAR JUST HOW GOOD IT SEEMED TO BE BACK ON HOSPITAL EARTH AGAIN
1311-134176-0001 THE SEASONS HAD CHANGED AND THE PORT OF PHILADELPHIA LAY UNDER THE STEAMING SUMMER SUN AS DAL STEPPED OFF THE SHUTTLE SHIP TO JOIN THE HURRYING CROWDS IN THE GREAT SPACE PORT IT SEEMED ALMOST AS THOUGH HE WERE COMING HOME
1311-134176-0002 HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT OF THE NIGHT NOT SO LONG BEFORE WHEN HE HAD WAITED HERE FOR THE SHUTTLE TO HOSPITAL SEATTLE TO ATTEND THE MEETING OF THE MEDICAL TRAINING COUNCIL HE HAD WORN NO UNIFORM THEN
1311-134176-0003 NOT EVEN THE COLLAR AND CUFF OF THE PROBATIONARY PHYSICIAN AND HE REMEMBERED HIS DESPAIR THAT NIGHT WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT THAT HIS CAREER AS A PHYSICIAN FROM HOSPITAL EARTH WAS AT AN END
1311-134176-0004 NOW HE WAS RETURNING BY SHUTTLE FROM HOSPITAL SEATTLE TO THE PORT OF PHILADELPHIA AGAIN COMPLETING THE CYCLE THAT HAD BEEN STARTED MANY MONTHS BEFORE BUT THINGS WERE DIFFERENT NOW
1311-134176-0005 THE SCARLET CAPE OF THE RED SERVICE OF SURGERY HUNG FROM HIS SLENDER SHOULDERS NOW AND THE LIGHT OF THE STATION ROOM CAUGHT THE POLISHED SILVER EMBLEM ON HIS COLLAR IT WAS A TINY BIT OF METAL
1311-134176-0006 BUT ITS SIGNIFICANCE WAS ENORMOUS IT ANNOUNCED TO THE WORLD DAL TIMGAR'S FINAL AND PERMANENT ACCEPTANCE AS A PHYSICIAN BUT MORE IT SYMBOLIZED THE FAR REACHING DISTANCES HE HAD ALREADY TRAVELED
1311-134176-0007 AND WOULD TRAVEL AGAIN IN THE SERVICE OF HOSPITAL EARTH IT WAS THE SILVER STAR OF THE STAR SURGEON THE WEEK JUST PAST HAD BEEN BOTH EXCITING AND CONFUSING
1311-134176-0008 THE HOSPITAL SHIP HAD ARRIVED FIVE HOURS AFTER BLACK DOCTOR HUGO TANNER HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS ANAESTHESIA MOVING IN ON THE LANCET IN FRANTIC HASTE
1311-134176-0009 AND STARTING THE SHIPMENT OF SPECIAL SURGICAL SUPPLIES ANAESTHETICS AND MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT ACROSS IN LIFEBOATS ALMOST BEFORE CONTACT HAD BEEN STABILIZED A LARGE PASSENGER BOAT HURTLED AWAY FROM THE HOSPITAL SHIP'S SIDE
1311-134176-0010 CARRYING A PAIR OF FOUR STAR SURGEONS HALF A DOZEN THREE STAR SURGEONS TWO RADIOLOGISTS TWO INTERNISTS A DOZEN NURSES AND ANOTHER FOUR STAR BLACK DOCTOR ACROSS TO THE LANCET AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE PATROL SHIP'S ENTRANCE LOCK
1311-134176-0011 THEY DISCOVERED THAT THEIR HASTE HAD BEEN IN VAIN IT WAS LIKE GRAND ROUNDS IN THE GENERAL WARDS OF HOSPITAL PHILADELPHIA WITH THE FOUR STAR SURGEONS IN THE LEAD AS THEY TRAMPED ABOARD THE PATROL SHIP
1311-134176-0012 THEY FOUND BLACK DOCTOR TANNER SITTING QUIETLY AT HIS BEDSIDE READING A JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND TAKING NOTES HE GLARED UP AT THEM WHEN THEY BURST IN THE DOOR WITHOUT EVEN KNOCKING BUT ARE YOU FEELING WELL SIR
1311-134176-0013 YOU MEAN YOU PERMITTED A PROBATIONARY PHYSICIAN TO PERFORM THIS KIND OF SURGERY THE FOUR STAR SURGEON CRIED INCREDULOUSLY I DID NOT THE BLACK DOCTOR SNAPPED HE HAD TO DRAG ME KICKING AND SCREAMING INTO THE OPERATING ROOM
1311-134176-0014 BUT FORTUNATELY FOR ME THIS PARTICULAR PROBATIONARY PHYSICIAN HAD THE COURAGE OF HIS CONVICTIONS AS WELL AS WIT ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT I WOULD NOT SURVIVE IF HE WAITED FOR YOU TO GATHER YOUR ARMY TOGETHER
1311-134176-0015 BUT I THINK YOU WILL FIND THE SURGERY WAS HANDLED WITH EXCELLENT SKILL AGAIN I MUST REFER YOU TO DOCTOR TIMGAR FOR THE DETAILS I WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE TECHNIQUE OF THE SURGERY I ASSURE YOU BUT SIR THE CHIEF SURGEON BROKE IN
1311-134176-0016 HOW COULD THERE HAVE BEEN SURGERY OF ANY SORT HERE THE DISPATCH THAT CAME TO US LISTED THE LANCET AS A PLAGUE SHIP PLAGUE SHIP THE BLACK DOCTOR EXPLODED
1311-134176-0017 THE DOCTORS EXAMINED HIM WITHIN AN INCH OF HIS LIFE THEY EXHAUSTED EVERY MEANS OF PHYSICAL LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION SHORT OF RE OPENING HIS CHEST AND LOOKING IN
1311-134176-0018 AND AT LAST THE CHIEF SURGEON WAS FORCED RELUCTANTLY TO ADMIT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HIM TO DO BUT PROVIDE POST OPERATIVE FOLLOW UP CARE FOR THE IRASCIBLE OLD MAN AND BY THE TIME THE EXAMINATION WAS OVER AND THE BLACK DOCTOR WAS MOVED ABOARD THE HOSPITAL SHIP
1311-134176-0019 IMMEDIATELY TO THE MEDICAL TRAINING COUNCIL AT HOSPITAL SEATTLE UPON ARRIVAL IN ORDER TO GIVE THEIR FORMAL GENERAL PRACTICE PATROL REPORTS AND TO RECEIVE THEIR APPOINTMENTS RESPECTIVELY AS STAR PHYSICIAN STAR DIAGNOSTICIAN
1311-134176-0020 AND STAR SURGEON THE ORDERS WERE SIGNED WITH THE PERSONAL MARK OF HUGO TANNER PHYSICIAN OF THE BLACK SERVICE OF PATHOLOGY NOW THE CEREMONY AND CELEBRATION IN HOSPITAL SEATTLE WERE OVER
1311-134176-0021 HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE BLACK DOCTOR ARNQUIST AT THE INVESTMENT CEREMONIES BUT THERE HAD BEEN NEITHER SIGN NOR WORD FROM HIM DAL TRIED TO REACH HIM AFTER THE CEREMONIES WERE OVER ALL HE COULD LEARN WAS THAT THE BLACK DOCTOR WAS UNAVAILABLE
1311-134176-0022 AND THEN A MESSAGE HAD COME THROUGH TO DAL UNDER THE OFFICIAL HOSPITAL EARTH HEADQUARTERS PRIORITY REQUESTING HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF AT ONCE AT THE GRAND COUNCIL BUILDING AT HOSPITAL PHILADELPHIA FOR AN INTERVIEW OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
1311-134176-0023 HE FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS ON THE DISPATCH NOW AND REACHED THE GRAND COUNCIL BUILDING WELL AHEAD OF THE APPOINTED TIME HE FOLLOWED CORRIDORS AND RODE ELEVATORS UNTIL HE REACHED THE TWENTY SECOND STORY OFFICE SUITE WHERE HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO REPORT
1311-134176-0024 THE WHOLE BUILDING SEEMED ALIVE WITH BUSTLE AS THOUGH SOMETHING OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE WAS GOING ON HIGH RANKING PHYSICIANS OF ALL THE SERVICES WERE HURRYING ABOUT GATHERING IN LITTLE GROUPS AT THE ELEVATORS AND TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES IN HUSHED VOICES
1311-134176-0025 EVEN MORE STRANGE DAL SAW DELEGATION AFTER DELEGATION OF ALIEN CREATURES MOVING THROUGH THE BUILDING SOME IN THE SPECIAL ATMOSPHERE MAINTAINING DEVICES NECESSARY FOR THEIR SURVIVAL ON EARTH
1311-134176-0026 SOME CHARACTERISTICALLY ALONE AND UNACCOMPANIED OTHERS IN THE COMPANY OF GREAT RETINUES OF UNDERLINGS DAL PAUSED IN THE MAIN CONCOURSE OF THE BUILDING AS HE SAW TWO SUCH DELEGATIONS ARRIVE BY SPECIAL CAR FROM THE PORT OF PHILADELPHIA
1311-134176-0027 ODD HE SAID QUIETLY REACHING IN TO STROKE FUZZY'S HEAD
1311-134176-0028 WHAT DO YOU THINK LAST TIME I SAW A GATHERING LIKE THIS WAS BACK AT HOME DURING ONE OF THE CENTENNIAL CONCLAVES OF THE GALACTIC CONFEDERATION ON THE TWENTY SECOND FLOOR A SECRETARY USHERED HIM INTO AN INNER OFFICE
1311-134176-0029 I'LL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU DIRECTLY HE WAITED UNTIL THE OTHERS HAD DEPARTED THEN HE CROSSED THE ROOM AND PRACTICALLY HUGGED DAL IN DELIGHT IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU BOY HE SAID AND ABOVE ALL
1311-134176-0030 IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT SILVER STAR AT LAST YOU AND YOUR LITTLE PINK FRIEND HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB A FAR BETTER JOB THAN I THOUGHT YOU WOULD DO I MUST ADMIT DAL PERCHED FUZZY ON HIS SHOULDER BUT
1311-134176-0031 WHAT IS THIS ABOUT AN INTERVIEW WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME AND WHAT ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE DOING HERE DOCTOR ARNQUIST LAUGHED DON'T WORRY HE SAID YOU WON'T HAVE TO STAY FOR THE COUNCIL MEETING
1311-134176-0032 AS A FOUR STAR BLACK DOCTOR TO HAVE TO SIT AND LISTEN AND SMILE THROUGH IT ALL BUT IN THE END IT WILL BE WORTH IT AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW THAT YOUR NAME WILL BE MENTIONED MANY TIMES DURING THESE SESSIONS
1311-134176-0033 MY NAME YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE A GUINEA PIG DID YOU THE BLACK DOCTOR SAID I I'M AFRAID I DIDN'T AN UNWITTING TOOL SO TO SPEAK THE BLACK DOCTOR CHUCKLED
1311-134176-0034 YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT THE GALACTIC CONFEDERATION HAS BEEN DELAYING AND STALLING ANY ACTION ON HOSPITAL EARTH'S APPLICATION FOR FULL STATUS AS ONE OF THE CONFEDERATION POWERS AND FOR A SEAT ON THE COUNCIL
1311-134176-0035 WE HAD FULFILLED TWO CRITERIA FOR ADMISSION WITHOUT DIFFICULTY WE HAD RESOLVED OUR PROBLEMS AT HOME SO THAT WE WERE FREE FROM WAR ON OUR OWN PLANET AND WE HAD A TALENT THAT IS MUCH NEEDED
1311-134176-0036 AND BADLY IN DEMAND IN THE GALAXY A JOB TO DO THAT WOULD FIT INTO THE CONFEDERATION'S ORGANIZATION BUT THE CONFEDERATION HAS ALWAYS HAD A THIRD CRITERION FOR ITS MEMBERSHIP
1311-134176-0037 A CRITERION THAT HOSPITAL EARTH COULD NOT SO EASILY PROVE OR DEMONSTRATE THE BLACK DOCTOR SMILED AFTER ALL THERE COULD BE NO PLACE IN A TRUE CONFEDERATION OF WORLDS FOR ANY ONE RACE OF PEOPLE THAT
1311-134176-0038 CONSIDERED ITSELF SUPERIOR TO ALL THE REST NO RACE CAN BE ADMITTED TO THE CONFEDERATION UNTIL ITS MEMBERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF TOLERANCE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE MEMBERS OF OTHER RACES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING
1311-134176-0039 AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE NATURE OF EARTHMEN TO BE INTOLERANT TO ASSUME THAT ONE WHO LOOKS STRANGE AND BEHAVES DIFFERENTLY MUST SOMEHOW BE INFERIOR
1311-134176-0040 THE BLACK DOCTOR CROSSED THE ROOM AND OPENED A FOLDER ON THE DESK YOU CAN READ THE DETAILS SOME OTHER TIME IF YOU LIKE YOU WERE SELECTED BY THE GALACTIC CONFEDERATION FROM A THOUSAND POSSIBLE APPLICANTS
1311-134176-0041 TO SERVE AS A TEST CASE TO SEE IF A PLACE COULD BE MADE FOR YOU ON HOSPITAL EARTH NO ONE HERE WAS TOLD OF YOUR POSITION NOT EVEN YOU ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF US SUSPECTED THE TRUTH
1311-134176-0042 THE CONFEDERATION WANTED TO SEE IF A WELL QUALIFIED LIKEABLE AND INTELLIGENT CREATURE FROM ANOTHER WORLD WOULD BE ACCEPTED AND ELEVATED TO EQUAL RANK AS A PHYSICIAN WITH EARTHMEN
1311-134176-0043 DAL STARED AT HIM AND I WAS THE ONE YOU WERE THE ONE IT WAS A STRUGGLE ALL RIGHT BUT HOSPITAL EARTH HAS FINALLY SATISFIED THE CONFEDERATION
1311-134176-0044 AT THE END OF THIS CONCLAVE WE WILL BE ADMITTED TO FULL MEMBERSHIP AND GIVEN A PERMANENT SEAT AND VOTE IN THE GALACTIC COUNCIL OUR PROBATIONARY PERIOD WILL BE OVER BUT
1311-134176-0045 ENOUGH OF THAT WHAT ABOUT YOU WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO NOW THAT YOU HAVE THAT STAR ON YOUR COLLAR THEY TALKED THEN ABOUT THE FUTURE
1311-134176-0046 WHILE JACK WAS ACCEPTING A TEMPORARY TEACHING POST IN THE GREAT DIAGNOSTIC CLINIC AT HOSPITAL PHILADELPHIA THERE WERE A DOZEN THINGS THAT DAL HAD CONSIDERED BUT FOR THE MOMENT
1311-134176-0047 HE WANTED ONLY TO TRAVEL FROM MEDICAL CENTER TO MEDICAL CENTER ON HOSPITAL EARTH OBSERVING AND STUDYING IN ORDER TO DECIDE HOW HE WOULD BEST LIKE TO USE HIS ABILITIES AND HIS POSITION AS A PHYSICIAN FROM HOSPITAL EARTH
1311-134176-0048 IT WILL BE IN SURGERY OF COURSE HE SAID JUST WHERE IN SURGERY OR WHAT KIND I DON'T KNOW JUST YET BUT THERE WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO DECIDE THAT THEN GO ALONG DOCTOR ARNQUIST SAID
1311-134176-0049 WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS AND BLESSING YOU HAVE TAUGHT US A GREAT DEAL AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE LEARNED SOME THINGS AT THE SAME TIME DAL HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THEN HE NODDED
1311-134176-0050 I'VE LEARNED SOME THINGS HE SAID BUT THERE'S STILL ONE THING THAT I WANT TO DO BEFORE I GO HE LIFTED HIS LITTLE PINK FRIEND GENTLY DOWN FROM HIS SHOULDER AND RESTED HIM IN THE CROOK OF HIS ARM
1311-134176-0051 FUZZY LOOKED UP AT HIM BLINKING HIS SHOE BUTTON EYES HAPPILY YOU ASKED ME ONCE TO LEAVE FUZZY WITH YOU AND I REFUSED I COULDN'T SEE THEN HOW I COULD POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT HIM EVEN THE THOUGHT WAS FRIGHTENING
1311-134176-0052 BUT NOW I THINK I'VE CHANGED MY MIND HE REACHED OUT AND PLACED FUZZY GENTLY IN THE BLACK DOCTOR'S HAND I WANT YOU TO KEEP HIM HE SAID I DON'T THINK I'LL NEED HIM ANY MORE I'LL MISS HIM
1311-134176-0053 BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I DON'T HAVE HIM NOW BE GOOD TO HIM AND LET ME VISIT HIM ONCE IN A WHILE THE BLACK DOCTOR LOOKED AT DAL AND THEN LIFTED FUZZY UP TO HIS OWN SHOULDER
1311-134176-0054 FOR A MOMENT THE LITTLE CREATURE SHIVERED AS IF AFRAID THEN HE BLINKED TWICE AT DAL TRUSTINGLY AND SNUGGLED IN COMFORTABLY AGAINST THE BLACK DOCTOR'S NECK WITHOUT A WORD DAL TURNED AND WALKED OUT OF THE OFFICE
1311-134176-0055 HE SMILED AS HE STEPPED FROM THE ELEVATOR INTO THE MAIN LOBBY AND CROSSED THROUGH THE CROWD TO THE STREET DOORS
