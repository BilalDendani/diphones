7839-110063-0000 I INCLUDE UNDER THIS NAME EVERYTHING RELATING TO FRIENDLY ATTENTIONS SUCH AS SERVICES LOANS PRESENTS ADVICE AND ALSO THINGS IN RELATION TO DISCRETION SUCH AS RESPECT IN CONVERSATION LETTERS
7839-110063-0001 THEY EXPRESS SUCH FEELING REGRET THAT THEY STILL INSPIRE US WITH GRATITUDE IN SHORT THEIR CONDUCT APPEARS SO PERFECTLY NATURAL THAT IT REALLY SEEMS THAT THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH IS OFFERED THEM OF OBLIGING US
7839-110063-0002 IS OBLIGING THEMSELVES THEY REFUSE ALL OUR THANKS WITHOUT AFFECTATION OR EFFORT THIS AMIABLE CHARACTER A NECESSARY ATTENDANT OF PERFECT GOOD BREEDING IS NOT ALWAYS FOUND WITH ALL ITS CHARMS
7839-110063-0003 IN THE WORLD THERE ARE BESIDES SOME OBLIGING PERSONS WHO FORCE US TO EXTORT THEIR SERVICES WHO FEEL OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE WHO LIKE TO BE SUPPLICATED AND THANKED TO EXCESS
7839-110063-0004 DO NOT IMITATE THEM THEY MAKE US UNGRATEFUL IN SPITE OF OURSELVES THEY MAKE GRATITUDE A PAIN AND A BURDEN WHEN ONE ASKS OF YOU ANY FAVOR REPLY KINDLY I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
7839-110063-0005 AND SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO RENDER YOU ANY ASSISTANCE IN MY POWER OR ELSE WITH A SAD MANNER
7839-110063-0006 SO GREAT IS THEIR TRIFLING IN THIS RESPECT THAT THEY CAN BE JUSTLY COMPARED TO THOSE FALSE HEROES WHO ARE ALWAYS TALKING OF FIGHTING AND WHO WOULD BE PUT TO FLIGHT AT THE SIGHT OF A DRAWN SWORD THESE INDICATIONS OF ZEAL ARE SUSPICIOUS
7839-110063-0007 WHEN THEY ARE EMPLOYED EVERY MOMENT AND WITHOUT ANY REASON A KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD TEACHES US TO DISCERN THEM AND TO GIVE THEM THAT DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE WHICH THEY MERIT SOMETIMES WE CAN CONGRATULATE PERSONS WISH THEM WELL
7839-110063-0008 WHICH WOULD INFALLIBLY BE SHOWN IF WE SHOULD MANIFEST TO THEM THE COLDNESS WHICH THEY INSPIRE IT BELONGS TO THOSE PERSONS WHO KNOW THE WORLD NOT TO CONFOUND THIS POLITENESS
7839-110063-0009 OF WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOVE IN ORDER THAT A SERVICE MAY BE COMPLETED IT IS NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE QUICKLY NOTHING BEING MORE DISOBLIGING THAN TARDINESS
7839-110063-0010 AND THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH YOU PLACE A PERSON IN EITHER OF ADDRESSING TO YOU NEW SOLICITATIONS OR OF SUFFERING BY YOUR DELAY YOUR TARDY ASSISTANCE MAY PERHAPS BE PREJUDICIAL
7839-110063-0011 AND PROMISE TO MAKE REPARATION FOR YOUR NEGLECT ON HIS PART THE PERSON WHO IS UNDER THE OBLIGATION TO YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL OF USING A SINGLE TERM OF REPROACH AND OF ACCOSTING YOU WITH AN AIR OF DISSATISFACTION
7839-110063-0012 WHEN ANY ONE WHO IS VISITING YOU HAS NEED OF A SHAWL A HANDKERCHIEF A HAT OFFER IT WITH A COMPLAISANT ZEAL RESIST THE REFUSAL WHICH IS MADE AND WHICH PROPRIETY DOES NOT REQUIRE
7839-110063-0013 THESE THINGS ARE RETURNED THE NEXT DAY BY A DOMESTIC WHO IS CHARGED TO THANK THE PERSON FOR THEM IF THE ARTICLES ARE LINEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED BEFORE THEY ARE WASHED WHEN A LADY HAS BORROWED ORNAMENTS OF ANOTHER
7839-110063-0014 ALL THIS ADVICE IS MINUTE BUT WHAT KIND WILL YOU HAVE IT CONCERNS FEMALE SELF ESTEEM ONE SPECIES OF BORROWING WHICH IS OF DAILY OCCURRENCE AND HAPPENS VERY OFTEN TO THE LOSS OF THE OWNERS IS THE BORROWING OF BOOKS
7839-110063-0015 PERSONS ARE SO WANTING IN DELICACY ON THIS SUBJECT THAT THOSE WHO HAVE A PASSION FOR BOOKS AND WHO ARE VERY OBLIGING IN OTHER RESPECTS ARE FORCED TO REFUSE MAKING THESE TROUBLESOME LOANS THE CASE HOWEVER IS A VERY PERPLEXING ONE
7839-110063-0016 WE CANNOT SAY I AM NOT WILLING TO LEND YOU THIS WORK BUT IF THE BORROWER IS A SUSPICIOUS PERSON WE CAN SAY WE HAVE OCCASION TO USE IT THAT WE REGRET IT VERY MUCH BUT THAT WE WILL LEND IT TO HIM IN A FEW DAYS
7839-110063-0017 HOWEVER WE DO NOT LEND IT AT ALL WELL BRED PERSONS DO NOT MAKE A BARE REQUEST FOR A BOOK THEY WAIT UNTIL IT IS OFFERED AND THEN THEY ACCEPT THE OFFER HESITATINGLY THEY FIND OUT THE LENGTH OF TIME THEY CAN KEEP IT
7839-110063-0018 AND RETURN IT PUNCTUALLY AT THE APPOINTED DAY IN ORDER TO PREVENT EVERY ACCIDENT THEY COVER IT WITH CLOTH OR PAPER SINCE THE FAVOR SHOULD RENDER THEM MORE CAREFUL THAN THE VALUE OF THE BOOK THEY ALSO TAKE CARE NOT TO TURN DOWN THE LEAVES
7839-110063-0019 WE MUST REPAIR THE LOSS IMMEDIATELY I SHALL NOT SPEAK OF MORE IMPORTANT LOANS WHICH ARE OUT OF THE RANGE OF POLITENESS SECTION TWO OF PRESENTS
7839-110063-0020 AND THEY OCCUR UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES ON OUR ARRIVAL AT A PLACE FROM WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ABSENT FOR A LONG TIME WHEN OUR INTIMATE FRIENDS LEAVE THE TOWN IN WHICH WE RESIDE ON OUR RETURN FROM A JOURNEY PARTICULARLY TO THE CAPITAL
7839-110063-0021 IN REMARKABLE AND REMOTE COUNTRIES ON BIRTH DAYS OR DAYS OF BAPTISM OR NEW YEAR'S DAY BUT THIS DAY IS NOT THE ONLY OCCASION OF EXCHANGING PRESENTS IN A FAMILY IT IS ALSO AN OCCASION FOR RECOLLECTING SERVICES AND CIVILITIES
7839-110063-0022 OF MAKING OUR RESPECTS TO LADIES TO SUPERIORS WHOM WE WISH TO HONOR IT MOREOVER OFFERS US A DELICATE MEANS OF SUCCORING THE UNFORTUNATE SECONDLY AT HARVEST TIME IF ONE OWNS LAND
7839-110063-0023 IN THE HUNTING SEASON IF ONE IS A HUNTER IT IS IN GOOD TON TO SEND TO OUR INTIMATE FRIENDS FINE FRUITS RARE FLOWERS OR SOME CHOICE ARTICLES OF GAME THE MOST DELICATE PRESENTS ARE THE PRODUCTIONS OF OUR OWN INDUSTRY
7839-110063-0024 ARE NOT USED ON OCCASIONS OF CEREMONY NEXT TO FITNESS OF TIME FOR PRESENTS COMES FITNESS IN THE SELECTION OF THEM GENERALLY
7839-110063-0025 BUT THIS RULE HAS NUMEROUS EXCEPTIONS
7839-110063-0026 TO WHICH CERTAIN INCIDENTS WOULD GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF CHARITY STILL WE SHOULD BE IN AN ERROR TO SUPPOSE THAT A PRESENT IS SUITABLE WHICH IS BRILLIANT ALONE IT MUST BY ALL MEANS BE ADAPTED TO THE TASTE AGE AND PROFESSIONS OF PERSONS AND THEIR CONNEXIONS WITH US
7839-110063-0027 HAVE EVINCED A LIVELY SATISFACTION SAY THAT THE GIFT RECEIVES ALL ITS VALUE FROM THEIR OPINION OF IT HOWEVER SLIGHT CHARM A PRESENT MAY HAVE
7839-110063-0028 ADVICE IS A VERY GOOD THING IT IS TRUE IT IS HOWEVER A THING WHICH IN SOCIETY IS THE MOST DISPLEASING A GIVER OF ADVICE WHO IS INCESSANTLY REPEATING IF I WAS IN YOUR PLACE
7839-110063-0029 I SHOULD DO SO AND SO REPELS EVERY ONE BY HIS PRIDE AND INDISCRETION SUCH AN IMPERTINENT PERSON SHOULD KNOW THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO GIVE ADVICE WITHOUT HE IS ASKED
7839-110063-0030 AND THAT THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ASK IT IS VERY LIMITED WE ARE NOT HOWEVER SPEAKING HERE OF GRATIFICATIONS OF VANITY BUT OF THAT ADVICE THE KINDNESS AND AFFECTION OF WHICH GIVES IT A CLAIM TO OUR ATTENTION
7839-110063-0031 IT IS NECESSARY TO USE MUCH RESERVE AND CARE BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WOULD SEEM TO HAVE A TONE OF SUPERIORITY WHICH WOULD ARRAY THE SELF ESTEEM OF YOUR FRIEND AGAINST YOUR WISEST COUNSELS OF THE FORMS OF MODESTY
7839-110063-0032 NO ONE IN THIS PLACE IS SUPERFLUOUS WE MAY SAY IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I AM MISTAKEN I SHOULD BE FAR FROM HAVING THE COURAGE TO ENQUIRE OF YOU
7839-110063-0033 DO NOT SAY YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME BUT I HAVE NOT EXPRESSED MYSELF PROPERLY
7839-110063-0034 THE DUTIES OF DISCRETION ARE SO SENSIBLY FELT BY PERSONS OF GOOD BREEDING THAT THEY DO NOT VIOLATE THEM EXCEPT THROUGH FORGETFULNESS IT WILL BE ENOUGH THEN TO MAKE AN ENUMERATION OF THEM
7839-110063-0035 WITHOUT INTENDING TO POINT OUT THEIR NECESSITY DISCRETION REQUIRES IN THE FIRST PLACE RESPECT WITH REGARD TO CONVERSATION IF WHEN WE ENTER THE HOUSE OF ANY ONE WE HEAR PERSONS TALKING IN AN EARNEST MANNER
7839-110063-0036 WE STEP MORE HEAVILY IN ORDER TO GIVE NOTICE TO THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATION IF IN AN ASSEMBLY TWO PERSONS RETIRE BY THEMSELVES TO SPEAK OF BUSINESS WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO APPROACH THEM
7839-110063-0037 NOR SPEAK TO THEM UNTIL THEY HAVE SEPARATED PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED A LITTLE IN THE WORLD KNOW HOW ESSENTIAL IT IS NOT TO MINGLE WITH CURIOSITY IN THE BUSINESS OF PERSONS WHOM WE VISIT
7839-110063-0038 NOR ARE THEY IGNORANT WHAT CONDUCT IS TO BE OBSERVED IN CASE WE SURPRISE PERSONS BY AN UNEXPECTED CALL BUT YOUNG PERSONS MAY NOT KNOW AND I BEG THEM TO GIVE THEIR ATTENTION TO IT WHEN WE SEE A PERSON OCCUPIED WE RETIRE
7839-110063-0039 OR AT LEAST MAKE SIGNS OF IT IF THEY SHOULD DETAIN US WE STEP ASIDE AND APPEAR TO BE EXAMINING A PICTURE OR LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT WE TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT ENGAGES THEM
7839-110063-0040 BUT THE DESIRE TO FIND FOR OURSELVES SOME SUCH OCCUPATION OUGHT NOT TO LEAD US TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES OF BOOKS PLACED UPON THE CHIMNEY PIECE OR ELSEWHERE TO RUN OVER A PAMPHLET OR TO HANDLE VISITING CARDS OR LETTERS
7839-110063-0041 EVEN THOUGH IT BE ONLY TO READ THE SUPERSCRIPTION IF THE PERSON VISITED SHOULD BE OPENING A CLOSET OR DRAWERS IT WOULD BE RUDE CURIOSITY TO APPROACH IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT WAS CONTAINED THERE IF AMONG A NUMBER OF VALUABLE THINGS
7839-110063-0042 THEY TAKE ONE TO SHOW YOU BE SATISFIED WITH LOOKING AT THAT ALONE WITHOUT APPEARING TO THINK OF THE OTHERS IF BEFORE THE PERSON VISITED COMES IN WE SHOULD SEE ANOTHER VISITOR WHO TO PASS THE TIME
7839-110063-0043 SHOULD TAKE A JOURNAL OR A BOOK FROM HIS POCKET IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY IMPOLITE TO READ OVER HIS SHOULDER AND EQUALLY UNCIVIL TO READ WHAT A PERSON IS WRITING IT IS NOT ALLOWABLE TO TAKE DOWN THE BOOKS FROM A LIBRARY
7839-110063-0044 BUT WE MAY AND WE EVEN OUGHT TO READ THE TITLES IN ORDER TO PRAISE THE GOOD TASTE WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE CHOICE OF THE WORKS
7839-110063-0045 DO NOT BE IN HASTE TO ASK FOR IT OR TO TAKE IT BY REACHING OUT YOUR HAND WAIT MODESTLY UNTIL IT COMES TO YOU DO NOT EXAMINE IT TOO LONG WHEN YOU HAVE IT
7839-110063-0046 AND IF BY CHANCE ANY ILL BRED PERSON REQUESTS IT BEFORE YOU HAVE SEEN IT DO NOT DETAIN IT IT IS BETTER TO SUFFER THIS SMALL PRIVATION THAN TO PASS FOR A BADLY EDUCATED VIRTUOSO
7839-110063-0047 HOWEVER INSIGNIFICANT THE BOASTED OBJECT MAY BE NEVER CRITICISE IT IF YOUR OPINION IS ASKED
7839-110063-0048 IF THE THING IS REALLY CURIOUS ABSTAIN FROM EXAGGERATED COMPLIMENTS TO VIOLATE THE SECRESY OF LETTERS UNDER ANY PRETEXT WHATEVER IS SO BASE AND ODIOUS THAT I DARE NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT IT
7839-110063-0049 I THINK I OUGHT TO SAY THAT IT IS ALSO VERY REPREHENSIBLE TO ENDEAVOR TO READ ANY PART OF A LETTER FOLDED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE PARTLY OPEN AT THE ENDS AND WHEN A CERTAIN PASSAGE IN A LETTER CONCERNING YOURSELF IS HANDED YOU TO READ
7839-110063-0050 YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR FINGER BELOW IT IN ORDER NOT TO READ ANYTHING MORE AND IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO ADD ANYTHING IN A LETTER HAVE THE DISCRETION NOT TO CAST YOUR EYES OVER THE REST AND BE EXPEDITIOUS
7839-110063-0051 IF A PERSON BRINGS YOU A LETTER YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN A HURRY TO OPEN IT BUT SEE WHETHER THE LETTER CONCERNS THE BEARER AT ALL
