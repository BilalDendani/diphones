1901-146686-0000 SOME OF THEM ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE WHICH WILL BE PAID THE REST IS GONE
1901-146686-0001 SHE HAS LEFT LESSONS THE RISK OF RUNNING THE NORTHERN COURSE WHEN IT IS MENACED BY ICEBERGS IS REVEALED THE CRUELTY OF SENDING A SHIP TO SEA WITHOUT ENOUGH LIFE BOATS AND LIFE RAFTS TO HOLD HER COMPANY IS EXHIBITED AND UNDERLINED IN BLACK
1901-146686-0002 SHE HAS LEFT SORROWS HUNDREDS OF HUMAN HEARTS AND HOMES ARE IN MOURNING FOR THE LOSS OF DEAR COMPANIONS AND FRIENDS
1901-146686-0003 IT IS AN EVIDENCE OF THE DIVINE IN HUMANITY WHY SHOULD WE CARE THERE IS NO REASON IN THE WORLD UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING IN US THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM LIME AND CARBON AND PHOSPHORUS SOMETHING THAT MAKES US MORTALS ABLE TO SUFFER TOGETHER
1901-146686-0004 FOR WE HAVE ALL OF US AN HUMAN HEART BUT THERE IS MORE THAN THIS HARVEST OF DEBTS AND LESSONS AND SORROWS IN THE TRAGEDY OF THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC THERE IS A GREAT IDEAL
1901-146686-0005 IT IS CLEARLY OUTLINED AND SET BEFORE THE MIND AND HEART OF THE MODERN WORLD TO APPROVE AND FOLLOW OR TO DESPISE AND REJECT IT IS WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST WHATEVER HAPPENED ON THAT DREADFUL APRIL NIGHT AMONG THE ARCTIC ICE
1901-146686-0006 CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE ORDER GIVEN BY THE BRAVE AND STEADFAST CAPTAIN CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE LAW OBEYED BY THE MEN ON THE DOOMED SHIP BUT WHY THERE IS NO STATUTE OR ENACTMENT OF ANY NATION TO ENFORCE SUCH AN ORDER
1901-146686-0007 THERE IS NO TRACE OF SUCH A RULE TO BE FOUND IN THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS THERE IS NO AUTHORITY FOR IT AMONG THE HEATHEN RACES TO DAY ON A CHINESE SHIP IF WE MAY BELIEVE THE REPORT OF AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE
1901-146686-0008 THE RULE WOULD HAVE BEEN MEN FIRST CHILDREN NEXT AND WOMEN LAST THERE IS CERTAINLY NO ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS BARBARIC RULE ON PHYSICAL OR MATERIAL GROUNDS ON THE AVERAGE A MAN IS STRONGER THAN A WOMAN HE IS WORTH MORE THAN A WOMAN
1901-146686-0009 HE HAS A LONGER PROSPECT OF LIFE THAN A WOMAN THERE IS NO REASON IN ALL THE RANGE OF PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE NO REASON IN ALL THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SUPERMAN WHY HE SHOULD GIVE HIS PLACE IN THE LIFE BOAT TO A WOMAN
1901-146686-0010 IT COMES FROM GOD THROUGH THE FAITH OF JESUS OF NAZARETH IT IS THE IDEAL OF SELF SACRIFICE IT IS THE RULE THAT THE STRONG OUGHT TO BEAR THE INFIRMITIES OF THOSE THAT ARE WEAK
1901-146686-0011 GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN THAN THIS THAT A MAN LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIENDS IT NEEDS A TRAGIC CATASTROPHE LIKE THE WRECK OF THE TITANIC TO BRING OUT THE ABSOLUTE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THIS IDEAL
1901-146686-0012 AND ALL THE COUNSELS OF MATERIALISM AND SELFISH EXPEDIENCY I DO NOT SAY THAT THE GERM OF THIS IDEAL MAY NOT BE FOUND IN OTHER RELIGIONS I DO NOT SAY THAT THEY ARE AGAINST IT I DO NOT ASK ANY MAN TO ACCEPT MY THEOLOGY
1901-146686-0013 THE IDEAL WHICH ANIMATES THE RULE OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST IS IN ESSENTIAL HARMONY WITH THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IF WHAT HE SAID ABOUT OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN IS TRUE THIS IDEAL IS SUPREMELY REASONABLE
