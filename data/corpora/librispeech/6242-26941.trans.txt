6242-26941-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN A FLORENTINE JOKE EARLY THE NEXT MORNING TITO WAS RETURNING FROM BRATTI'S SHOP IN THE NARROW THOROUGHFARE OF THE FERRAVECCHI THE GENOESE STRANGER HAD CARRIED AWAY THE ONYX RING AND TITO WAS CARRYING AWAY FIFTY FLORINS
6242-26941-0001 IT DID JUST CROSS HIS MIND THAT IF AFTER ALL FORTUNE BY ONE OF HER ABLE DEVICES SAVED HIM FROM THE NECESSITY OF QUITTING FLORENCE
6242-26941-0002 SINCE HE HAD BEEN UNDERSTOOD TO WEAR IT FOR THE SAKE OF PECULIAR MEMORIES AND PREDILECTIONS STILL IT WAS A SLIGHT MATTER NOT WORTH DWELLING ON WITH ANY EMPHASIS AND IN THOSE MOMENTS HE HAD LOST HIS CONFIDENCE IN FORTUNE
6242-26941-0003 HAD GIVEN PLACE TO A DULL REGRETFUL LASSITUDE HE CARED SO MUCH FOR THE PLEASURES THAT COULD ONLY COME TO HIM THROUGH THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS FELLOW MEN THAT HE WISHED NOW HE HAD NEVER RISKED IGNOMINY BY SHRINKING FROM WHAT HIS FELLOW MEN CALLED OBLIGATIONS
6242-26941-0004 BUT OUR DEEDS ARE LIKE CHILDREN THAT ARE BORN TO US THEY LIVE AND ACT APART FROM OUR OWN WILL NAY CHILDREN MAY BE STRANGLED BUT DEEDS NEVER THEY HAVE AN INDESTRUCTIBLE LIFE BOTH IN AND OUT OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS
6242-26941-0005 AND THAT DREADFUL VITALITY OF DEEDS WAS PRESSING HARD ON TITO FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WAS GOING BACK TO HIS LODGINGS IN THE PIAZZA DI SAN GIOVANNI BUT HE AVOIDED PASSING THROUGH THE MERCATO VECCHIO WHICH WAS HIS NEAREST WAY LEST HE SHOULD SEE TESSA
6242-26941-0006 HE WAS NOT IN THE HUMOUR TO SEEK ANYTHING HE COULD ONLY AWAIT THE FIRST SIGN OF HIS ALTERING LOT THE PIAZZA WITH ITS SIGHTS OF BEAUTY WAS LIT UP BY THAT WARM MORNING SUNLIGHT UNDER WHICH THE AUTUMN DEW STILL LINGERS
6242-26941-0007 AND WHICH INVITES TO AN IDLESSE UNDULLED BY FATIGUE IT WAS A FESTIVAL MORNING TOO WHEN THE SOFT WARMTH SEEMS TO STEAL OVER ONE WITH A SPECIAL INVITATION TO LOUNGE AND GAZE HERE TOO THE SIGNS OF THE FAIR WERE PRESENT
6242-26941-0008 IN THE SPACES ROUND THE OCTAGONAL BAPTISTERY STALLS WERE BEING SPREAD WITH FRUIT AND FLOWERS AND HERE AND THERE LADEN MULES WERE STANDING QUIETLY ABSORBED IN THEIR NOSE BAGS WHILE THEIR DRIVERS WERE PERHAPS GONE THROUGH THE HOSPITABLE SACRED DOORS
6242-26941-0009 TO KNEEL BEFORE THE BLESSED VIRGIN ON THIS MORNING OF HER NATIVITY ON THE BROAD MARBLE STEPS OF THE DUOMO THERE WERE SCATTERED GROUPS OF BEGGARS AND GOSSIPING TALKERS HERE AN OLD CRONE WITH WHITE HAIR AND HARD SUNBURNT FACE
6242-26941-0010 ENCOURAGING A ROUND CAPPED BABY TO TRY ITS TINY BARE FEET ON THE WARMED MARBLE WHILE A DOG SITTING NEAR SNUFFED AT THE PERFORMANCE SUSPICIOUSLY THERE A COUPLE OF SHAGGY HEADED BOYS LEANING TO WATCH A SMALL PALE CRIPPLE
6242-26941-0011 WHO WAS CUTTING A FACE ON A CHERRY STONE AND ABOVE THEM ON THE WIDE PLATFORM MEN WERE MAKING CHANGING KNOTS IN LAUGHING DESULTORY CHAT OR ELSE WERE STANDING IN CLOSE COUPLES GESTICULATING EAGERLY
6242-26941-0012 BUT THE LARGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT COMPANY OF LOUNGERS WAS THAT TOWARDS WHICH TITO HAD TO DIRECT HIS STEPS IT WAS THE BUSIEST TIME OF THE DAY WITH NELLO AND IN THIS WARM SEASON AND AT AN HOUR WHEN CLIENTS WERE NUMEROUS
6242-26941-0013 MOST MEN PREFERRED BEING SHAVED UNDER THE PRETTY RED AND WHITE AWNING IN FRONT OF THE SHOP RATHER THAN WITHIN NARROW WALLS IT IS NOT A SUBLIME ATTITUDE FOR A MAN TO SIT WITH LATHERED CHIN THROWN BACKWARD AND HAVE HIS NOSE MADE A HANDLE OF
6242-26941-0014 BUT TO BE SHAVED WAS A FASHION OF FLORENTINE RESPECTABILITY
6242-26941-0015 WHEN YESTERDAY'S CROP OF GOSSIP WAS FRESHEST AND THE BARBER'S TONGUE WAS ALWAYS IN ITS GLORY WHEN HIS RAZOR WAS BUSY THE DEFT ACTIVITY OF THOSE TWO INSTRUMENTS SEEMED TO BE SET GOING BY A COMMON SPRING
6242-26941-0016 TITO FORESAW THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO ESCAPE BEING DRAWN INTO THE CIRCLE HE MUST SMILE AND RETORT AND LOOK PERFECTLY AT HIS EASE WELL IT WAS BUT THE ORDEAL OF SWALLOWING BREAD AND CHEESE PILLS AFTER ALL
6242-26941-0017 THE MAN WHO LET THE MERE ANTICIPATION OF DISCOVERY CHOKE HIM WAS SIMPLY A MAN OF WEAK NERVES BUT JUST AT THAT TIME TITO FELT A HAND LAID ON HIS SHOULDER AND NO AMOUNT OF PREVIOUS RESOLUTION COULD PREVENT THE VERY UNPLEASANT SENSATION
6242-26941-0018 WITH WHICH THAT SUDDEN TOUCH JARRED HIM HIS FACE AS HE TURNED IT ROUND BETRAYED THE INWARD SHOCK BUT THE OWNER OF THE HAND THAT SEEMED TO HAVE SUCH EVIL MAGIC IN IT BROKE INTO A LIGHT LAUGH HE WAS A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TITO'S OWN AGE
6242-26941-0019 WITH KEEN FEATURES SMALL CLOSE CLIPPED HEAD AND CLOSE SHAVEN LIP AND CHIN GIVING THE IDEA OF A MIND AS LITTLE ENCUMBERED AS POSSIBLE WITH MATERIAL THAT WAS NOT NERVOUS THE KEEN EYES WERE BRIGHT WITH HOPE AND FRIENDLINESS
6242-26941-0020 AS SO MANY OTHER YOUNG EYES HAVE BEEN THAT HAVE AFTERWARDS CLOSED ON THE WORLD IN BITTERNESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT FOR AT THAT TIME THERE WERE NONE BUT PLEASANT PREDICTIONS ABOUT NICCOLO MACCHIAVELLI AS A YOUNG MAN OF PROMISE WHO WAS EXPECTED TO MEND THE BROKEN FORTUNES OF HIS ANCIENT FAMILY
6242-26941-0021 WHY MELEMA
6242-26941-0022 AH MESSER NICCOLO SAID TITO RECOVERING HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY
6242-26941-0023 THAT SHUDDERED AT THE APPROACH OF YOUR WIT BUT THE FACT IS I HAVE HAD A BAD NIGHT THAT IS UNLUCKY BECAUSE YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO SHINE WITHOUT ANY OBSTRUCTING FOG TO DAY IN THE RUCELLAI GARDENS I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED YOU ARE TO BE THERE
6242-26941-0024 MESSER BERNARDO DID ME THE HONOUR TO INVITE ME SAID TITO BUT I SHALL BE ENGAGED ELSEWHERE AH I REMEMBER YOU ARE IN LOVE SAID MACCHIAVELLI WITH A SHRUG
6242-26941-0025 ELSE YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE SUCH INCONVENIENT ENGAGEMENTS WHY WE ARE TO EAT A PEACOCK AND ORTOLANS UNDER THE LOGGIA AMONG BERNARDO RUCELLAI'S RARE TREES THERE ARE TO BE THE CHOICEST SPIRITS IN FLORENCE AND THE CHOICEST WINES
6242-26941-0026 ONLY AS PIERO DE MEDICI IS TO BE THERE THE CHOICE SPIRITS MAY HAPPEN TO BE SWAMPED IN THE CAPPING OF IMPROMPTU VERSES I HATE THAT GAME IT IS A DEVICE FOR THE TRIUMPH OF SMALL WITS WHO ARE ALWAYS INSPIRED THE MOST BY THE SMALLEST OCCASIONS
6242-26941-0027 WHAT IS THAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT PIERO DE MEDICI AND SMALL WITS MESSER NICCOLO SAID NELLO WHOSE LIGHT FIGURE WAS AT THAT MOMENT PREDOMINATING OVER THE HERCULEAN FRAME OF NICCOLO CAPARRA THAT FAMOUS WORKER IN IRON WHOM WE SAW LAST WITH BARED MUSCULAR ARMS AND LEATHERN APRON
6242-26941-0028 IN THE MERCATO VECCHIO WAS THIS MORNING DRESSED IN HOLIDAY SUIT AND AS HE SAT SUBMISSIVELY WHILE NELLO SKIPPED ROUND HIM LATHERED HIM SEIZED HIM BY THE NOSE AND SCRAPED HIM WITH MAGICAL QUICKNESS
6242-26941-0029 AND WAS PREPARING TO GO INTO SOCIETY A PRIVATE SECRETARY WILL NEVER RISE IN THE WORLD IF HE COUPLES GREAT AND SMALL IN THAT WAY CONTINUED NELLO WHEN GREAT MEN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MARRY THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS AS THEY LIKE SMALL MEN MUST NOT EXPECT TO MARRY THEIR WORDS AS THEY LIKE
6242-26941-0030 THAT PAGOLANTONIO SODERINI HAS GIVEN SER PIERO DA BIBBIENA A BOX ON THE EAR FOR SETTING ON PIERO DE MEDICI
6242-26941-0031 I DON'T KNOW WHICH I ENVY HIM MOST SAID MACCHIAVELLI THE OFFENCE OR THE PUNISHMENT THE OFFENCE WILL MAKE HIM THE MOST POPULAR MAN IN ALL FLORENCE AND THE PUNISHMENT WILL TAKE HIM AMONG THE ONLY PEOPLE IN ITALY WHO HAVE KNOWN HOW TO MANAGE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
6242-26941-0032 YES IF SODERINI STAYS LONG ENOUGH AT VENICE SAID CENNINI HE MAY CHANCE TO LEARN THE VENETIAN FASHION AND BRING IT HOME WITH HIM THE SODERINI HAVE BEEN FAST FRIENDS OF THE MEDICI
6242-26941-0033 BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS LIKELY TO OPEN PAGOLANTONIO'S EYES TO THE GOOD OF OUR OLD FLORENTINE TRICK OF CHOOSING A NEW HARNESS WHEN THE OLD ONE GALLS US IF WE HAVE NOT QUITE LOST THE TRICK IN THESE LAST FIFTY YEARS NOT WE
6242-26941-0034 SAID NICCOLO CAPARRA WHO WAS REJOICING IN THE FREE USE OF HIS LIPS AGAIN
6242-26941-0035 THAT'S WHAT I SAY TO OUR PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET NOISY OVER THEIR CUPS AT SAN GALLO
6242-26941-0036 WHEN THERE'S WATER ENOUGH ARNO WILL BE FULL AND THAT WILL NOT BE TILL THE TORRENT IS READY
6242-26941-0037 SAID NELLO YOU COULD NEVER HAVE MADE IT WITH THAT DARK RUST ON YOUR CHIN ECCO MESSER DOMENICO I AM READY FOR YOU NOW BY THE WAY MY BEL ERUDITO CONTINUED NELLO AS HE SAW TITO MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR
6242-26941-0038 HE WILL COME AGAIN PRESENTLY THE OLD MAN LOOKED MOURNFUL AND SEEMED IN HASTE I HOPE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG IN THE VIA DE BARDI DOUBTLESS MESSER TITO KNOWS THAT BARDO'S SON IS DEAD SAID CRONACA WHO HAD JUST COME UP TITO'S HEART GAVE A LEAP
6242-26941-0039 HAD THE DEATH HAPPENED BEFORE ROMOLA SAW HIM NO I HAD NOT HEARD IT HE SAID WITH NO MORE DISCOMPOSURE THAN THE OCCASION SEEMED TO WARRANT TURNING AND LEANING AGAINST THE DOORPOST
6242-26941-0040 I KNEW THAT HIS SISTER HAD GONE TO SEE HIM DID HE DIE BEFORE SHE ARRIVED NO SAID CRONACA I WAS IN SAN MARCO AT THE TIME AND SAW HER COME OUT FROM THE CHAPTER HOUSE WITH FRA GIROLAMO
6242-26941-0041 WHO TOLD US THAT THE DYING MAN'S BREATH HAD BEEN PRESERVED AS BY A MIRACLE THAT HE MIGHT MAKE A DISCLOSURE TO HIS SISTER TITO FELT THAT HIS FATE WAS DECIDED
6242-26941-0042 AGAIN HIS MIND RUSHED OVER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM FLORENCE AND HE CONCEIVED A PLAN OF GETTING BACK HIS MONEY FROM CENNINI BEFORE THE DISCLOSURE HAD BECOME PUBLIC IF HE ONCE HAD HIS MONEY
6242-26941-0043 HE WOULD WAIT NOW AND GO AWAY WITH CENNINI AND GET THE MONEY FROM HIM AT ONCE WITH THAT PROJECT IN HIS MIND HE STOOD MOTIONLESS HIS HANDS IN HIS BELT HIS EYES FIXED ABSENTLY ON THE GROUND
6242-26941-0044 NELLO GLANCING AT HIM FELT SURE THAT HE WAS ABSORBED IN ANXIETY ABOUT ROMOLA AND THOUGHT HIM SUCH A PRETTY IMAGE OF SELF FORGETFUL SADNESS THAT HE JUST PERCEPTIBLY POINTED HIS RAZOR AT HIM AND GAVE A CHALLENGING LOOK AT PIERO DI COSIMO
6242-26941-0045 WHOM HE HAD NEVER FORGIVEN FOR HIS REFUSAL TO SEE ANY PROGNOSTICS OF CHARACTER IN HIS FAVOURITE'S HANDSOME FACE PIERO WHO WAS LEANING AGAINST THE OTHER DOORPOST CLOSE TO TITO SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
6242-26941-0046 THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF SUCH CHALLENGES FROM NELLO HAD CHANGED THE PAINTER'S FIRST DECLARATION OF NEUTRALITY INTO A POSITIVE INCLINATION TO BELIEVE ILL OF THE MUCH PRAISED GREEK SO YOU HAVE GOT YOUR FRA GIROLAMO BACK AGAIN CRONACA
6242-26941-0047 I SUPPOSE WE SHALL HAVE HIM PREACHING AGAIN THIS NEXT ADVENT SAID NELLO AND NOT BEFORE THERE IS NEED SAID CRONACA GRAVELY
6242-26941-0048 HE HAS NO LACK OF POETS ABOUT HIM SAID CRONACA WITH QUIET CONTEMPT BUT THEY ARE GREAT POETS AND NOT LITTLE ONES SO THEY ARE CONTENTED TO BE TAUGHT BY HIM AND NO MORE THINK THE TRUTH STALE WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN HIM TO UTTER
6242-26941-0049 THAN THEY THINK THE LIGHT OF THE MOON IS STALE BUT PERHAPS CERTAIN HIGH PRELATES AND PRINCES
6242-26941-0050 MIGHT BE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THOUGH GIOVANNI PICO AND POLIZIANO AND MARSILIO FICINO AND MOST OTHER MEN OF MARK IN FLORENCE REVERENCE FRA GIROLAMO
6242-26941-0051 POLIZIANO
6242-26941-0052 YES DOUBTLESS HE BELIEVES IN YOUR NEW JONAH WITNESS THE FINE ORATIONS HE WROTE FOR THE ENVOYS OF SIENNA TO TELL ALEXANDER THE SIXTH THAT THE WORLD AND THE CHURCH WERE NEVER SO WELL OFF AS SINCE HE BECAME POPE
6242-26941-0053 SAID MACCHIAVELLI SMILING A VARIOUS SCHOLAR MUST HAVE VARIOUS OPINIONS
6242-26941-0054 THE SECRET OF ORATORY LIES NOT IN SAYING NEW THINGS BUT IN SAYING THINGS WITH A CERTAIN POWER THAT MOVES THE HEARERS
6242-26941-0055 YOUR SPEAKER DESERVES TO BE CALLED
6242-26941-0056 AND ACCORDING TO THAT TEST FRA GIROLAMO IS A GREAT ORATOR THAT IS TRUE NICCOLO SAID CENNINI SPEAKING FROM THE SHAVING CHAIR BUT PART OF THE SECRET LIES IN THE PROPHETIC VISIONS
6242-26941-0057 OUR PEOPLE NO OFFENCE TO YOU CRONACA WILL RUN AFTER ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF A PROPHET ESPECIALLY IF HE PROPHESIES TERRORS AND TRIBULATIONS RATHER SAY CENNINI ANSWERED CRONACA
6242-26941-0058 WHICH STAMP HIM AS A MESSENGER OF GOD I ADMIT IT I ADMIT IT SAID CENNINI OPENING HIS PALMS AS HE ROSE FROM THE CHAIR HIS LIFE IS SPOTLESS NO MAN HAS IMPEACHED IT HE IS SATISFIED WITH THE PLEASANT LUST OF ARROGANCE
6242-26941-0059 I CAN SEE IT IN THAT PROUD LIP AND SATISFIED EYE OF HIS HE HEARS THE AIR FILLED WITH HIS OWN NAME FRA GIROLAMO SAVONAROLA OF FERRARA THE PROPHET THE SAINT THE MIGHTY PREACHER
6242-26941-0060 SAID THE CONCILIATORY NELLO LET ME STOP YOUR MOUTH WITH A LITTLE LATHER I MUST NOT HAVE MY FRIEND CRONACA MADE ANGRY I HAVE A REGARD FOR HIS CHIN AND HIS CHIN IS IN NO RESPECT ALTERED SINCE HE BECAME A PIAGNONE
6242-26941-0061 I GOT INTO SUCH A TRICK OF SLIPPING IN TO LISTEN TO HIM THAT I MIGHT HAVE TURNED PIAGNONE TOO IF I HAD NOT BEEN HINDERED BY THE LIBERAL NATURE OF MY ART AND ALSO BY THE LENGTH OF THE SERMONS WHICH ARE SOMETIMES A GOOD WHILE BEFORE THEY GET TO THE MOVING POINT BUT AS MESSER NICCOLO HERE SAYS
6242-26941-0062 FOR WHAT SAYS LUIGI PULCI DOMBRUNO'S SHARP CUTTING SCIMITAR HAD THE FAME OF BEING ENCHANTED BUT SAYS LUIGI I AM RATHER OF OPINION THAT IT CUT SHARP BECAUSE IT WAS OF STRONGLY TEMPERED STEEL YES YES PATERNOSTERS MAY SHAVE CLEAN
6242-26941-0063 BUT THEY MUST BE SAID OVER A GOOD RAZOR SEE NELLO SAID MACCHIAVELLI WHAT DOCTOR IS THIS ADVANCING ON HIS BUCEPHALUS I THOUGHT YOUR PIAZZA WAS FREE FROM THOSE FURRED AND SCARLET ROBED LACKEYS OF DEATH
6242-26941-0064 AND HAD HIS BONNET AND MANTLE PICKLED A LITTLE IN THE GUTTER THOUGH HE HIMSELF
6242-26941-0065 AS HE LOOKED UP TOWARDS THE ADVANCING FIGURE A ROUND HEADED ROUND BODIED PERSONAGE SEATED ON A RAW YOUNG HORSE WHICH HELD ITS NOSE OUT WITH AN AIR OF THREATENING OBSTINACY AND BY A CONSTANT EFFORT TO BACK AND GO OFF IN AN OBLIQUE LINE
6242-26941-0066 SHOWED FREE VIEWS ABOUT AUTHORITY VERY MUCH IN ADVANCE OF THE AGE AND I HAVE A FEW MORE ADVENTURES IN PICKLE FOR HIM CONTINUED NELLO IN AN UNDERTONE WHICH I HOPE WILL DRIVE HIS INQUIRING NOSTRILS TO ANOTHER QUARTER OF THE CITY
6242-26941-0067 HE'S A DOCTOR FROM PADUA THEY SAY HE HAS BEEN AT PRATO FOR THREE MONTHS AND NOW HE'S COME TO FLORENCE TO SEE WHAT HE CAN NET BUT HIS GREAT TRICK IS MAKING ROUNDS AMONG THE CONTADINI AND DO YOU NOTE THOSE GREAT SADDLE BAGS HE CARRIES
6242-26941-0068 THEY ARE TO HOLD THE FAT CAPONS AND EGGS AND MEAL HE LEVIES ON SILLY CLOWNS WITH WHOM COIN IS SCARCE HE VENDS HIS OWN SECRET MEDICINES SO HE KEEPS AWAY FROM THE DOORS OF THE DRUGGISTS
6242-26941-0069 AND MAKING IT A RESORT FOR ASTHMAS AND SQUALLING BAMBINI IT STIRS MY GALL TO SEE THE TOAD FACED QUACK FINGERING THE GREASY QUATTRINI
6242-26941-0070 BUT I'LL PUT A FEW THORNS IN HIS SADDLE ELSE I'M NO FLORENTINE LAUDAMUS HE IS COMING TO BE SHAVED THAT'S WHAT I'VE WAITED FOR
6242-26941-0071 WHICH I DEVISED TWO DAYS AGO HERE SANDRO NELLO WHISPERED IN THE EAR OF SANDRO WHO ROLLED HIS SOLEMN EYES NODDED AND FOLLOWING UP THESE SIGNS OF UNDERSTANDING WITH A SLOW SMILE TOOK TO HIS HEELS WITH SURPRISING RAPIDITY
6242-26941-0072 HOW IS IT WITH YOU MAESTRO TACCO SAID NELLO AS THE DOCTOR WITH DIFFICULTY BROUGHT HIS HORSE'S HEAD ROUND TOWARDS THE BARBER'S SHOP
6242-26941-0073 IS AN ACCURSED BEAST THE VERMOCANE SEIZE HIM
6242-26941-0074 DESCENDING FROM HIS SADDLE AND FASTENING THE OLD BRIDLE MENDED WITH STRING TO AN IRON STAPLE IN THE WALL
6242-26941-0075 I HAD HIM CHEAP RATHER TOO HARD RIDING FOR A MAN WHO CARRIES YOUR WEIGHT OF LEARNING EH MAESTRO SAID NELLO YOU SEEM HOT TRULY I AM LIKELY TO BE HOT SAID THE DOCTOR TAKING OFF HIS BONNET
6242-26941-0076 AND GIVING TO FULL VIEW A BALD LOW HEAD AND FLAT BROAD FACE WITH HIGH EARS WIDE LIPLESS MOUTH ROUND EYES AND DEEP ARCHED LINES ABOVE THE PROJECTING EYEBROWS WHICH ALTOGETHER MADE NELLO'S EPITHET TOAD FACED
6242-26941-0077 DUBIOUSLY COMPLIMENTARY TO THE BLAMELESS BATRACHIAN
6242-26941-0078 LIKE YOUR FLORENCE DOCTORS MOREOVER I HAVE HAD NOT A LITTLE PULLING TO GET THROUGH THE CARTS AND MULES INTO THE MERCATO TO FIND OUT THE HUSBAND OF A CERTAIN MONNA GHITA WHO HAD HAD A FATAL SEIZURE BEFORE I WAS CALLED IN
6242-26941-0079 AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT I HAD TO DEMAND MY FEES MONNA GHITA
6242-26941-0080 PEACE BE WITH HER ANGRY SOUL THE MERCATO WILL WANT A WHIP THE MORE IF HER TONGUE IS LAID TO REST TITO WHO HAD ROUSED HIMSELF FROM HIS ABSTRACTION AND WAS LISTENING TO THE DIALOGUE FELT A NEW RUSH OF THE VAGUE HALF FORMED IDEAS ABOUT TESSA
6242-26941-0081 WHICH HAD PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND THE EVENING BEFORE IF MONNA GHITA WERE REALLY TAKEN OUT OF THE WAY IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR HIM TO SEE TESSA AGAIN WHENEVER HE WANTED TO SEE HER
6242-26941-0082 YOU ARE THE SLAVE OF RUDE MORTALS WHO BUT FOR YOU WOULD DIE LIKE BRUTES WITHOUT HELP OF PILL OR POWDER IT IS PITIFUL TO SEE YOUR LEARNED LYMPH OOZING FROM YOUR PORES AS IF IT WERE MERE VULGAR MOISTURE YOU THINK MY SHAVING WILL COOL AND DISENCUMBER YOU
6242-26941-0083 ONE MOMENT AND I HAVE DONE WITH MESSER FRANCESCO HERE IT SEEMS TO ME A THOUSAND YEARS TILL I WAIT UPON A MAN WHO CARRIES ALL THE SCIENCE OF ARABIA IN HIS HEAD AND SADDLE BAGS ECCO NELLO HELD UP THE SHAVING CLOTH WITH AN AIR OF INVITATION
6242-26941-0084 AND MAESTRO TACCO ADVANCED AND SEATED HIMSELF UNDER A PREOCCUPATION WITH HIS HEAT AND HIS SELF IMPORTANCE WHICH MADE HIM QUITE DEAF TO THE IRONY CONVEYED IN NELLO'S OFFICIOUSLY POLITE SPEECH
6242-26941-0085 IT IS BUT FITTING THAT A GREAT MEDICUS LIKE YOU SAID NELLO ADJUSTING THE CLOTH SHOULD BE SHAVED BY THE SAME RAZOR
6242-26941-0086 THE CHIRURGIC ART INTERRUPTED THE DOCTOR WITH AN AIR OF CONTEMPTUOUS DISGUST IS IT YOUR FLORENTINE FASHION TO PUT THE MASTERS OF THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE ON A LEVEL WITH MEN WHO DO CARPENTRY ON BROKEN LIMBS AND SEW UP WOUNDS LIKE TAILORS
6242-26941-0087 AND CARVE AWAY EXCRESCENCES AS A BUTCHER TRIMS MEAT VIA A MANUAL ART SUCH AS ANY ARTIFICER MIGHT LEARN AND WHICH HAS BEEN PRACTISED BY SIMPLE BARBERS LIKE YOURSELF ON A LEVEL WITH THE NOBLE SCIENCE OF HIPPOCRATES GALEN AND AVICENNA
6242-26941-0088 WHICH PENETRATES INTO THE OCCULT INFLUENCES OF THE STARS AND PLANTS AND GEMS A SCIENCE LOCKED UP FROM THE VULGAR NO IN TRUTH MAESTRO SAID NELLO USING HIS LATHER VERY DELIBERATELY
6242-26941-0089 AS IF HE WANTED TO PROLONG THE OPERATION TO THE UTMOST I NEVER THOUGHT OF PLACING THEM ON A LEVEL I KNOW YOUR SCIENCE COMES NEXT TO THE MIRACLES OF HOLY CHURCH FOR MYSTERY BUT THERE YOU SEE IS THE PITY OF IT HERE NELLO FELL INTO A TONE OF REGRETFUL SYMPATHY
6242-26941-0090 YOUR HIGH SCIENCE IS SEALED FROM THE PROFANE AND THE VULGAR AND SO YOU BECOME AN OBJECT OF ENVY AND SLANDER I GRIEVE TO SAY IT BUT THERE ARE LOW FELLOWS IN THIS CITY MERE SGHERRI

6242-26941-0094 WHAT DO YOU MEAN LASSO
6242-26941-0095 THE FACT IS THERE IS A COMPANY OF EVIL YOUTHS WHO GO PROWLING ABOUT THE HOUSES OF OUR CITIZENS CARRYING SHARP TOOLS IN THEIR POCKETS NO SORT OF DOOR OR WINDOW OR SHUTTER BUT THEY WILL PIERCE IT
6242-26941-0096 THEY ARE POSSESSED WITH A DIABOLICAL PATIENCE TO WATCH THE DOINGS OF PEOPLE WHO FANCY THEMSELVES PRIVATE IT MUST BE THEY WHO HAVE DONE IT IT MUST BE THEY WHO HAVE SPREAD THE STORIES ABOUT YOU AND YOUR MEDICINES
6242-26941-0097 NO WELL I ADVISE YOU TO LOOK FOR IT IS NOW COMMONLY TALKED OF THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SEEN IN YOUR DWELLING AT THE CANTO DI PAGLIA MAKING YOUR SECRET SPECIFICS BY NIGHT POUNDING DRIED TOADS IN A MORTAR

6242-26941-0099 WHICH INDEED THESE WITNESSES PROFESS TO REPEAT IT IS A PACK OF LIES EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR STRUGGLING TO GET UTTERANCE AND THEN DESISTING IN ALARM AT THE APPROACHING RAZOR IT IS NOT TO ME OR ANY OF THIS RESPECTABLE COMPANY THAT YOU NEED TO SAY THAT DOCTOR
6242-26941-0100 WHAT ARE A HANDFUL OF REASONABLE MEN AGAINST A CROWD WITH STONES IN THEIR HANDS THERE ARE THOSE AMONG US WHO THINK CECCO D'ASCOLI WAS AN INNOCENT SAGE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW HE WAS BURNT ALIVE FOR BEING WISER THAN HIS FELLOWS
6242-26941-0101 AH DOCTOR IT IS NOT BY LIVING AT PADUA THAT YOU CAN LEARN TO KNOW FLORENTINES MY BELIEF IS THEY WOULD STONE THE HOLY FATHER HIMSELF IF THEY COULD FIND A GOOD EXCUSE FOR IT AND THEY ARE PERSUADED THAT YOU ARE A NECROMANCER
6242-26941-0102 WHO IS TRYING TO RAISE THE PESTILENCE BY SELLING SECRET MEDICINES AND I AM TOLD YOUR SPECIFICS HAVE IN TRUTH AN EVIL SMELL IT IS FALSE BURST OUT THE DOCTOR AS NELLO MOVED AWAY HIS RAZOR IT IS FALSE

6242-26941-0104 WHILE SANDRO WHO HAD NOW RETURNED AT A SIGN FROM HIS MASTER PLACED HIMSELF NEAR THE BRIDLE BEHOLD MESSERI SAID THE DOCTOR BRINGING A SMALL BOX OF MEDICINES AND OPENING IT BEFORE THEM
6242-26941-0105 LET ANY SIGNOR APPLY THIS BOX TO HIS NOSTRILS AND HE WILL FIND AN HONEST ODOUR OF MEDICAMENTS NOT INDEED OF POUNDED GEMS OR RARE VEGETABLES FROM THE EAST OR STONES FOUND IN THE BODIES OF BIRDS
6242-26941-0106 ACCORDING TO THEIR DEGREE AND THERE ARE EVEN REMEDIES KNOWN TO OUR SCIENCE WHICH ARE ENTIRELY FREE OF COST AS THE NEW TUSSIS MAY BE COUNTERACTED IN THE POOR WHO CAN PAY FOR NO SPECIFICS
6242-26941-0107 AND HERE IS A PASTE WHICH IS EVEN OF SAVOURY ODOUR AND IS INFALLIBLE AGAINST MELANCHOLIA BEING CONCOCTED UNDER THE CONJUNCTION OF JUPITER AND VENUS AND I HAVE SEEN IT ALLAY SPASMS STAY MAESTRO SAID NELLO
6242-26941-0108 WHILE THE DOCTOR HAD HIS LATHERED FACE TURNED TOWARDS THE GROUP NEAR THE DOOR EAGERLY HOLDING OUT HIS BOX AND LIFTING OUT ONE SPECIFIC AFTER ANOTHER HERE COMES A CRYING CONTADINA WITH HER BABY DOUBTLESS SHE IS IN SEARCH OF YOU
6242-26941-0109 HERE BUONA DONNA HERE IS THE FAMOUS DOCTOR WHY WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE SWEET BIMBO THIS QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED TO A STURDY LOOKING BROAD SHOULDERED CONTADINA WITH HER HEAD DRAPERY FOLDED ABOUT HER FACE SO THAT LITTLE WAS TO BE SEEN
6242-26941-0110 BUT A BRONZED NOSE AND A PAIR OF DARK EYES AND EYEBROWS SHE CARRIED HER CHILD PACKED UP IN THE STIFF MUMMY SHAPED CASE IN WHICH ITALIAN BABIES HAVE BEEN FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL INTRODUCED INTO SOCIETY TURNING ITS FACE A LITTLE TOWARDS HER BOSOM
6242-26941-0111 AND MAKING THOSE SORROWFUL GRIMACES WHICH WOMEN ARE IN THE HABIT OF USING AS A SORT OF PULLEYS TO DRAW DOWN RELUCTANT TEARS
6242-26941-0112 SAID THE WOMAN IN A WAILING VOICE
6242-26941-0113 I KNOW I CAN'T PAY YOU FOR IT BUT I TOOK IT INTO THE NUNZIATA LAST NIGHT AND IT'S TURNED A WORSE COLOUR THAN BEFORE IT'S THE CONVULSIONS BUT WHEN I WAS HOLDING IT BEFORE THE SANTISSIMA NUNZIATA

6242-26941-0115 THE MAGNIFICENT EIGHT WILL PUT YOU IN PRISON A LITTLE WHILE JUST TO INSURE YOUR SAFETY AND AFTER THAT THEIR SBIRRI WILL CONDUCT YOU OUT OF FLORENCE BY NIGHT
6242-26941-0116 WHO PREACHED AGAINST THE JEWS WHAT OUR PEOPLE ARE GIVEN TO STONE THROWING BUT WE HAVE MAGISTRATES THE DOCTOR UNABLE TO REFUSE SEATED HIMSELF IN THE SHAVING CHAIR TREMBLING HALF WITH FEAR AND HALF WITH RAGE

6242-26941-0118 LODGED THEM CAREFULLY ABOVE HIS FLAT NOSE AND HIGH EARS AND LIFTING UP HIS BROWS TURNED TOWARDS THE APPLICANT O SANTIDDIO LOOK AT HIM SAID THE WOMAN WITH A MORE PITEOUS WAIL THAN EVER AS SHE HELD OUT THE SMALL MUMMY
6242-26941-0119 WHICH HAD ITS HEAD COMPLETELY CONCEALED BY DINGY DRAPERY WOUND ROUND THE HEAD OF THE PORTABLE CRADLE
6242-26941-0120 THE DOCTOR ANXIOUSLY HOLDING HIS KNEES TOGETHER TO SUPPORT HIS BOX BENT HIS SPECTACLES TOWARDS THE BABY AND SAID CAUTIOUSLY IT MAY BE A NEW DISEASE UNWIND THESE RAGS MONNA THE CONTADINA WITH SUDDEN ENERGY SNATCHED OFF THE ENCIRCLING LINEN
6242-26941-0121 WHEN OUT STRUGGLED SCRATCHING GRINNING AND SCREAMING WHAT THE DOCTOR IN HIS FRIGHT FULLY BELIEVED TO BE A DEMON BUT WHAT TITO RECOGNISED AS VAIANO'S MONKEY MADE MORE FORMIDABLE BY AN ARTIFICIAL BLACKNESS SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE COME FROM A HASTY RUBBING UP THE CHIMNEY
