434-132650-0000 THE VISIT TO LORD POCOCURANTE A NOBLE VENETIAN
434-132650-0001 THE GARDENS LAID OUT WITH TASTE WERE ADORNED WITH FINE MARBLE STATUES THE PALACE WAS BEAUTIFULLY BUILT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN OF SIXTY AND VERY RICH HE RECEIVED THE TWO TRAVELLERS WITH POLITE INDIFFERENCE
434-132650-0002 WHICH PUT CANDIDE A LITTLE OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT WAS NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO MARTIN FIRST TWO PRETTY GIRLS VERY NEATLY DRESSED SERVED THEM WITH CHOCOLATE WHICH WAS FROTHED EXCEEDINGLY WELL
434-132650-0003 CANDIDE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM COMMENDING THEIR BEAUTY GRACE AND ADDRESS THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH CREATURES SAID THE SENATOR I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES
434-132650-0004 OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM BUT AFTER ALL THESE TWO GIRLS BEGIN TO WEARY ME
434-132650-0005 I HAVE A GREAT MANY PICTURES BUT I PRIZE THEM VERY LITTLE WHILE THEY WERE WAITING FOR DINNER POCOCURANTE ORDERED A CONCERT
434-132650-0006 THIS NOISE SAID THE SENATOR MAY AMUSE ONE FOR HALF AN HOUR BUT IF IT WERE TO LAST LONGER IT WOULD GROW TIRESOME TO EVERYBODY THOUGH THEY DURST NOT OWN IT MUSIC TO DAY IS ONLY THE ART OF EXECUTING DIFFICULT THINGS
434-132650-0007 LET WHO WILL GO TO SEE BAD TRAGEDIES SET TO MUSIC WHERE THE SCENES ARE CONTRIVED FOR NO OTHER END THAN TO INTRODUCE TWO OR THREE SONGS RIDICULOUSLY OUT OF PLACE TO SHOW OFF AN ACTRESS'S VOICE LET WHO WILL OR WHO CAN
434-132650-0008 DIE AWAY WITH PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OF AN EUNUCH QUAVERING THE ROLE OF CAESAR OR OF CATO AND STRUTTING AWKWARDLY UPON THE STAGE FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS
434-132650-0009 BUT WITH DISCRETION MARTIN WAS ENTIRELY OF THE SENATOR'S OPINION THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
434-132650-0010 THERE SAID HE IS A BOOK THAT WAS ONCE THE DELIGHT OF THE GREAT PANGLOSS THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN GERMANY IT IS NOT MINE ANSWERED POCOCURANTE COOLLY THEY USED AT ONE TIME TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT I TOOK A PLEASURE IN READING HIM
434-132650-0011 BUT THAT CONTINUAL REPETITION OF BATTLES SO EXTREMELY LIKE ONE ANOTHER THOSE GODS THAT ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING DECISIVE THAT HELEN WHO IS THE CAUSE OF THE WAR
434-132650-0012 I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED LEARNED MEN WHETHER THEY WERE NOT AS WEARY AS I OF THAT WORK THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY
434-132650-0013 I GRANT SAID THE SENATOR
434-132650-0014 HIS INSIPID LAVINIA I THINK THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE FLAT AND DISAGREEABLE I PREFER TASSO A GOOD DEAL OR EVEN THE SOPORIFIC TALES OF ARIOSTO
434-132650-0015 THERE ARE MAXIMS IN THIS WRITER ANSWERED POCOCURANTE FROM WHICH A MAN OF THE WORLD MAY REAP GREAT BENEFIT AND BEING WRITTEN IN ENERGETIC VERSE THEY ARE MORE EASILY IMPRESSED UPON THE MEMORY
434-132650-0016 BUT I CARE LITTLE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRUNDUSIUM AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR
434-132650-0017 I HAVE READ WITH MUCH DISTASTE HIS INDELICATE VERSES AGAINST OLD WOMEN AND WITCHES NOR DO I SEE ANY MERIT IN TELLING HIS FRIEND MAECENAS THAT IF HE WILL BUT RANK HIM IN THE CHOIR OF LYRIC POETS HIS LOFTY HEAD SHALL TOUCH THE STARS
434-132650-0018 FOOLS ADMIRE EVERYTHING IN AN AUTHOR OF REPUTATION FOR MY PART I READ ONLY TO PLEASE MYSELF I LIKE ONLY THAT WHICH SERVES MY PURPOSE
434-132650-0019 WAS MUCH SURPRISED AT WHAT HE HEARD MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
434-132650-0020 HERE IS THE GREAT MAN WHOM I FANCY YOU ARE NEVER TIRED OF READING I NEVER READ HIM REPLIED THE VENETIAN WHAT IS IT TO ME WHETHER HE PLEADS FOR RABIRIUS OR CLUENTIUS I TRY CAUSES ENOUGH MYSELF
434-132650-0021 I CONCLUDED THAT I KNEW AS MUCH AS HE AND THAT I HAD NO NEED OF A GUIDE TO LEARN IGNORANCE HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
434-132650-0022 THERE MIGHT BE SAID POCOCURANTE IF ONLY ONE OF THOSE RAKERS OF RUBBISH HAD SHOWN HOW TO MAKE PINS
434-132650-0023 AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY YOU MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER OPENS THEM MARTIN SAW SOME SHELVES FILLED WITH ENGLISH BOOKS
434-132650-0024 I HAVE A NOTION SAID HE THAT A REPUBLICAN MUST BE GREATLY PLEASED WITH MOST OF THESE BOOKS WHICH ARE WRITTEN WITH A SPIRIT OF FREEDOM YES ANSWERED POCOCURANTE IT IS NOBLE TO WRITE AS ONE THINKS THIS IS THE PRIVILEGE OF HUMANITY
434-132650-0025 IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES
434-132650-0026 ASKED WHETHER HE DID NOT LOOK UPON THIS AUTHOR AS A GREAT MAN WHO SAID POCOCURANTE THAT BARBARIAN WHO WRITES A LONG COMMENTARY IN TEN BOOKS OF HARSH VERSE ON THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS
434-132650-0027 AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM FOR A WRITER WHO HAS SPOILED TASSO'S HELL AND THE DEVIL
434-132650-0028 REPRESENTS THE DEVILS CANNONADING IN HEAVEN NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
434-132650-0029 ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER THIS OBSCURE WHIMSICAL AND DISAGREEABLE POEM WAS DESPISED UPON ITS FIRST PUBLICATION
434-132650-0030 AND I ONLY TREAT IT NOW AS IT WAS TREATED IN ITS OWN COUNTRY BY CONTEMPORARIES FOR THE MATTER OF THAT I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
434-132650-0031 I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
434-132650-0032 I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
434-132650-0033 YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
434-132650-0034 PLATO OBSERVED A LONG WHILE AGO THAT THOSE STOMACHS ARE NOT THE BEST THAT REJECT ALL SORTS OF FOOD
434-132650-0035 THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL WELL SAID CANDIDE I FIND THAT I SHALL BE THE ONLY HAPPY MAN WHEN I AM BLESSED WITH THE SIGHT OF MY DEAR CUNEGONDE IT IS ALWAYS WELL TO HOPE SAID MARTIN
