5206-19376-0000 THE ATTRACTING FORCE BETWEEN TWO SUCH BODIES IS NO LONGER EXACTLY TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF REVOLUTION AND THEREFORE KEPLER'S SECOND LAW IS NO LONGER PRECISELY OBEYED THE RATE OF DESCRIPTION OF AREAS IS SUBJECT TO SLIGHT ACCELERATION
5206-19376-0001 THE EFFECT OF THIS TANGENTIAL FORCE ACTING ON THE TIDE COMPELLING BODY IS GRADUALLY TO INCREASE ITS DISTANCE FROM THE OTHER BODY APPLYING THESE STATEMENTS TO THE EARTH AND MOON
5206-19376-0002 SO THAT IT TURNS ALWAYS THE SAME FACE TOWARDS US MOREOVER THAT ITS DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH IS STEADILY INCREASING
5206-19376-0003 LONG AGO THE MOON MUST THEREFORE HAVE BEEN MUCH NEARER THE EARTH
5206-19376-0004 TRADE WINDS AND STORMS WERE ALSO MORE VIOLENT IF EVER THE MOON WERE CLOSE TO THE EARTH IT WOULD HAVE TO REVOLVE ROUND IT IN ABOUT THREE HOURS IF THE EARTH ROTATED ON ITS AXIS IN THREE HOURS
5206-19376-0005 IT WOULD BE UNSTABLE AND BEGIN TO SEPARATE A PORTION OF ITSELF AS A KIND OF BUD WHICH MIGHT THEN GET DETACHED AND GRADUALLY PUSHED AWAY BY THE VIOLENT TIDAL ACTION HENCE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS THE HISTORY OF THE MOON IF SO
5206-19376-0006 IT IS PROBABLY AN EXCEPTIONAL HISTORY THE PLANETS WERE NOT FORMED FROM THE SUN IN THIS WAY
5206-19376-0007 HENCE WITH THEM THE PROCESS IS INVERTED AND THEY MUST BE APPROACHING HIM AND MAY SOME DAY CRASH ALONG HIS SURFACE THE INNER MOON IS NOW ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MILES AWAY
5206-19376-0008 AND WEIGHS THEREFORE IF COMPOSED OF ROCK
5206-19376-0009 WE CONSIDERED THE LOCAL PECULIARITIES OF THE TIDES THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE FORMED IN OPEN OCEAN UNDER THE ACTION OF THE MOON AND THE SUN
5206-19376-0010 AND ALSO THE MEANS BY WHICH THEIR HEIGHTS AND TIMES COULD BE CALCULATED AND PREDICTED YEARS BEFOREHAND TOWARDS THE END I STATED THAT THE SUBJECT WAS VERY FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED
5206-19376-0011 AND FIRST WE MUST REMIND OURSELVES OF THE FACT THAT ALMOST ALL THE ROCKS WHICH FORM THE ACCESSIBLE CRUST OF THE EARTH WERE DEPOSITED BY THE AGENCY OF WATER NEARLY ALL ARE ARRANGED IN REGULAR STRATA
5206-19376-0012 THE STRATA WHICH WERE ONCE HORIZONTAL ARE NOW SO NO LONGER THEY HAVE BEEN TILTED AND UPHEAVED BENT AND DISTORTED IN MANY PLACES SOME OF THEM AGAIN HAVE BEEN METAMORPHOSED BY FIRE SO THAT THEIR ORGANIC REMAINS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED
5206-19376-0013 THE DATE OF THEIR FORMATION NO MAN YET CAN TELL BUT THAT IT WAS VASTLY DISTANT IS CERTAIN FOR THE GEOLOGICAL ERA IS NOT OVER AQUEOUS ACTION STILL GOES ON STILL DOES FROST CHIP THE ROCKS INTO FRAGMENTS
5206-19376-0014 THE WAVES AND THE TIDES ARE STILL AT WORK ALONG EVERY COAST LINE EATING AWAY INTO THE CLIFFS UNDERMINING GRADUALLY AND SUBMERGING ACRE AFTER ACRE AND MAKING WITH THE REFUSE A SHINGLY OR A SANDY OR A MUDDY BEACH
5206-19376-0015 AND DRIVE AND DRAG UNTIL EVEN THE HARDEST ROCK LIKE BASALT BECOMES HONEYCOMBED INTO STRANGE GALLERIES AND PASSAGES FINGAL'S CAVE FOR INSTANCE AND THE SOFTER PARTS ARE CRUMBLED AWAY BUT THE AREA NOW EXPOSED TO THE TEETH OF THE WAVES IS NOT GREAT
5206-19376-0016 BUT THEY CANNOT REACH CLIFFS ONE HUNDRED FEET HIGH THEY CAN UNDERMINE SUCH CLIFFS INDEED AND THEN GRIND THE FRAGMENTS TO POWDER BUT THEIR DIRECT ACTION IS LIMITED NOT SO LIMITED HOWEVER AS THEY WOULD BE WITHOUT THE TIDES CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THE DENUDATION IMPORT OF THE TIDES
5206-19376-0017 BUT FEW PLACES ARE SO FAVOURABLY SITUATED AS LIVERPOOL IN THIS RESPECT AND THE DIRECT SCOURING ACTION OF THE TIDES IN GENERAL IS NOT VERY GREAT THEIR GEOLOGICAL IMPORT MAINLY CONSISTS IN THIS THAT THEY RAISE AND LOWER THE SURFACE WAVES AT REGULAR INTERVALS
5206-19376-0018 THE WAVES ARE A GREAT PLANING MACHINE ATTACKING THE LAND AND THE TIDES RAISE AND LOWER THIS PLANING MACHINE SO THAT ITS DENUDING TOOTH IS APPLIED NOW TWENTY FEET VERTICALLY ABOVE MEAN LEVEL NOW TWENTY FEET BELOW
5206-19376-0019 MAKING ALL ALLOWANCE FOR THE POWER OF WINDS AND WAVES CURRENTS TIDES AND WATERCOURSES ASSISTED BY GLACIAL ICE AND FROST IT MUST BE APPARENT HOW SLOWLY THE WORK OF FORMING THE ROCKS IS BEING CARRIED ON
5206-19376-0020 IT GOES ON STEADILY BUT SO SLOWLY THAT IT IS ESTIMATED TO TAKE SIX THOUSAND YEARS TO WEAR AWAY ONE FOOT OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT BY ALL THE DENUDING CAUSES COMBINED TO ERODE A STRATUM FIVE THOUSAND FEET THICK
5206-19376-0021 WILL REQUIRE AT THIS RATE THIRTY MILLION YEARS THE AGE OF THE EARTH IS NOT AT ALL ACCURATELY KNOWN BUT THERE ARE MANY GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING IT NOT TO BE MUCH OLDER THAN SOME THIRTY MILLION YEARS THAT IS TO SAY
5206-19376-0022 NOT GREATLY MORE THAN THIS PERIOD OF TIME HAS ELAPSED SINCE IT WAS IN A MOLTEN CONDITION IT MAY BE AS OLD AS A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS BUT ITS AGE IS BELIEVED BY THOSE MOST COMPETENT TO JUDGE TO BE MORE LIKELY WITHIN THIS LIMIT THAN BEYOND IT BUT IF WE ASK
5206-19376-0023 AND DENUDED AND RE FORMED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE GET AN ANSWER NOT IN FEET BUT IN MILES
5206-19376-0024 CONSTITUTE A STRATUM TEN MILES THICK AND EVERYWHERE THE ROCKS AT THE BASE OF OUR STRATIFIED SYSTEM ARE OF THE MOST STUPENDOUS VOLUME AND THICKNESS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PUZZLE HOW KNOWN AGENTS COULD HAVE FORMED THESE MIGHTY MASSES
5206-19376-0025 AND THE ONLY SOLUTION OFFERED BY GEOLOGISTS WAS UNLIMITED TIME GIVEN UNLIMITED TIME THEY COULD OF COURSE BE FORMED NO MATTER HOW SLOWLY THE PROCESS WENT ON
5206-19376-0026 IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO LOOK FOR A FAR MORE POWERFUL ENGINE THAN ANY NOW EXISTING THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME DENUDING AGENT IN THOSE REMOTE AGES AGES FAR MORE DISTANT FROM US THAN THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD
5206-19376-0027 FAR OLDER THAN ANY FORMS OF LIFE FOSSIL OR OTHERWISE AGES AMONG THE OLDEST KNOWN TO GEOLOGY A DENUDING AGENT MUST HAVE THEN EXISTED FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY WE NOW KNOW
5206-19376-0028 SUCH AN AGENT IT HAS BEEN THE PRIVILEGE OF ASTRONOMY AND PHYSICS WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS TO DISCOVER TO THIS DISCOVERY I NOW PROCEED TO LEAD UP OUR FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD OF TIME IS THE PERIOD OF THE EARTH'S ROTATION THE LENGTH OF THE DAY THE EARTH IS OUR
5206-19376-0029 ONE STANDARD CLOCK ALL TIME IS EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF IT AND IF IT BEGAN TO GO WRONG OR IF IT DID NOT GO WITH PERFECT UNIFORMITY IT WOULD SEEM A MOST DIFFICULT THING TO DISCOVER ITS ERROR AND A MOST PUZZLING PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE TO UTILIZE WHEN FOUND
5206-19376-0030 ANCIENT ECLIPSES AND THE LIKE AND WE FIND THAT THE RECORD OF THEIR OCCURRENCE AS MADE BY THE OLD MAGI OF CHALDAEA IS IN VERY CLOSE ACCORDANCE WITH THE RESULT OF CALCULATION ONE OF THESE FAMOUS OLD ECLIPSES WAS OBSERVED IN BABYLON ABOUT THIRTY SIX CENTURIES AGO
5206-19376-0031 THIS RESIDUAL DISCREPANCY WHEN EVERY KNOWN CAUSE HAS BEEN ALLOWED FOR AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE HOUR THE ECLIPSE OCCURRED LATER THAN CALCULATION WARRANTS NOW THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED FROM EITHER OF TWO CAUSES
5206-19376-0032 EITHER AN ACCELERATION OF THE MOON IN HER ORBIT OR A RETARDATION OF THE EARTH IN HER DIURNAL ROTATION A SHORTENING OF THE MONTH OR A LENGTHENING OF THE DAY OR BOTH THE TOTAL DISCREPANCY BEING SAY TWO HOURS
5206-19376-0033 SUPPOSE THE EARTH LOSES A SMALL PIECE OF TIME WHICH I WILL CALL AN INSTANT PER DAY A LOCALITY ON THE EARTH WILL COME UP TO A GIVEN POSITION ONE INSTANT LATE ON THE FIRST DAY AFTER AN EVENT
5206-19376-0034 ON THE NEXT DAY IT WOULD COME UP TWO INSTANTS LATE BY REASON OF THE PREVIOUS LOSS BUT IT ALSO LOSES ANOTHER INSTANT DURING THE COURSE OF THE SECOND DAY AND SO THE TOTAL LATENESS BY THE END OF THAT DAY AMOUNTS TO THREE INSTANTS THE DAY AFTER
5206-19376-0035 N PLUS ONE INSTANTS OR PRACTICALLY WHEN N IS BIG
5206-19376-0036 AND THE TOTAL LOSS HAS AMOUNTED TO AN HOUR HENCE THE LENGTH OF AN INSTANT THE LOSS PER DIEM
5206-19376-0037 WHENCE ONE INSTANT EQUALS THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLIONTH PART OF A SECOND
5206-19376-0038 IN A YEAR THE AGGREGATE LOSS MOUNTS UP
5206-19376-0039 IN A CENTURY TO ABOUT THREE SECONDS AND IN THIRTY SIX CENTURIES TO AN HOUR BUT EVEN AT THE END OF THE THIRTY SIX CENTURIES THE DAY IS BARELY ANY LONGER
5206-19376-0040 AND EVEN A MILLION YEARS AGO UNLESS THE RATE OF LOSS WAS DIFFERENT AS IT PROBABLY WAS THE DAY WOULD ONLY BE THIRTY FIVE MINUTES SHORTER
5206-19376-0041 THESE NUMBERS ARE TO BE TAKEN AS ILLUSTRATIVE NOT AS PRECISELY REPRESENTING TERRESTRIAL FACT WHAT CAN HAVE CAUSED THE SLOWING DOWN
5206-19376-0042 SWELLING OF THE EARTH BY REASON OF ACCUMULATION OF METEORIC DUST MIGHT DO SOMETHING BUT PROBABLY VERY LITTLE CONTRACTION OF THE EARTH AS IT GOES ON COOLING WOULD ACT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND PROBABLY MORE THAN COUNTERBALANCE THE DUST EFFECT
5206-19376-0043 THE PROBLEM IS THUS NOT A SIMPLE ONE FOR THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTURBING CAUSES AND FOR NONE OF THEM ARE THE DATA ENOUGH TO BASE A QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATE UPON BUT ONE CERTAIN AGENT IN LENGTHENING THE DAY AND ALMOST CERTAINLY THE MAIN AGENT IS TO BE FOUND IN THE TIDES
5206-19376-0044 REMEMBER THAT THE TIDAL HUMPS WERE PRODUCED AS THE PROLATENESS OF A SPHERE WHIRLED ROUND AND ROUND A FIXED CENTRE LIKE A FOOTBALL WHIRLED BY A STRING THESE HUMPS ARE PULLED AT BY THE MOON
5206-19376-0045 GIVING BACK AT ONE QUARTER SWING WHAT IT HAS RECEIVED AT THE PREVIOUS QUARTER BUT IN SO FAR AS IT ENCOUNTERS FRICTION WHICH IT DOES IN ALL CHANNELS WHERE THERE IS AN ACTUAL EBB AND FLOW OF THE WATER IT HAS TO RECEIVE MORE THAN IT GIVES BACK
5206-19376-0046 AND THE BALANCE OF ENERGY HAS TO BE MADE UP TO IT OR THE TIDES WOULD CEASE THE ENERGY OF THE TIDES IS IN FACT CONTINUALLY BEING DISSIPATED BY FRICTION AND ALL THE ENERGY SO DISSIPATED IS TAKEN FROM THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH
5206-19376-0047 IF TIDAL ENERGY WERE UTILIZED BY ENGINEERS THE MACHINES DRIVEN WOULD BE REALLY DRIVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF THE EARTH'S ROTATION IT WOULD BE A MODE OF HARNESSING THE EARTH AND USING THE MOON AS FIXED POINT OR FULCRUM
5206-19376-0048 THE MOON PULLING AT THE TIDAL PROTUBERANCE AND HOLDING IT STILL AS THE EARTH ROTATES IS THE MECHANISM WHEREBY THE ENERGY IS EXTRACTED THE HANDLE WHEREBY THE FRICTION BRAKE IS APPLIED
5206-19376-0049 IN OTHER WORDS TO MAKE THE DAY AND THE MONTH EQUAL THE SAME CAUSE MUST HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION BUT WITH EIGHTY FOLD GREATER INTENSITY ON THE MOON IT HAS CEASED NOW BECAUSE THE ROTATION HAS STOPPED
5206-19376-0050 BUT IF EVER THE MOON ROTATED ON ITS AXIS WITH RESPECT TO THE EARTH AND IF IT WERE EITHER FLUID ITSELF OR POSSESSED ANY LIQUID OCEAN THEN THE TIDES CAUSED BY THE PULL OF THE EARTH MUST HAVE BEEN PRODIGIOUS AND WOULD TEND TO STOP ITS ROTATION
5206-19376-0051 WE HAVE THUS ARRIVED AT THIS FACT
5206-19376-0052 THAN IT IS NOW A MILLION YEARS AGO IT WAS PERHAPS AN HOUR SHORTER TWENTY MILLION YEARS AGO IT MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH SHORTER FIFTY MILLION YEARS AGO IT MAY HAVE BEEN ONLY A FEW HOURS LONG
5206-19376-0053 THE EARTH MAY HAVE SPUN ROUND THEN QUITE QUICKLY BUT THERE IS A LIMIT IF IT SPUN TOO FAST IT WOULD FLY TO PIECES ATTACH SHOT BY MEANS OF WAX TO THE WHIRLING EARTH MODEL
5206-19376-0054 AND AT A CERTAIN SPEED THE COHESION OF THE WAX CANNOT HOLD THEM SO THEY FLY OFF THE EARTH IS HELD TOGETHER NOT BY COHESION BUT BY GRAVITATION IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO RECKON
5206-19376-0055 HOW FAST THE EARTH MUST SPIN FOR GRAVITY AT ITS SURFACE TO BE ANNULLED AND FOR PORTIONS TO FLY OFF
5206-19376-0056 THIS IS A CRITICAL SPEED IF EVER THE DAY WAS THREE HOURS LONG SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED THE DAY CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN SHORTER THAN THAT FOR IF IT WERE THE EARTH WOULD HAVE A TENDENCY TO FLY IN PIECES
5206-19376-0057 OR AT LEAST TO SEPARATE INTO TWO PIECES REMEMBER THIS AS A NATURAL RESULT OF A THREE HOUR DAY WHICH CORRESPONDS TO AN UNSTABLE STATE OF THINGS REMEMBER ALSO THAT IN SOME PAST EPOCH A THREE HOUR DAY IS A PROBABILITY
5206-19376-0058 IF WE THINK OF THE STATE OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE IF IT HAD AN ATMOSPHERE AT THAT REMOTE DATE WE SHALL RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF THE MOST FEARFUL TORNADOES
5206-19376-0059 INSTEAD OF WAITING SIX HOURS BETWEEN LOW AND HIGH TIDE WE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT ONLY THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR EVERY HOUR AND A HALF THE WATER WOULD EXECUTE A COMPLETE SWING FROM HIGH TIDE TO HIGH AGAIN
5206-19376-0060 IT CANNOT DO THAT WITHOUT ITSELF GETTING PULLED FORWARD THE PULL OF THE EARTH ON THE MOON WILL THEREFORE NOT BE QUITE CENTRAL BUT WILL BE A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF ITS CENTRE HENCE BY KEPLER'S SECOND LAW
5206-19376-0061 THE RATE OF DESCRIPTION OF AREAS BY ITS RADIUS VECTOR CANNOT BE CONSTANT BUT MUST INCREASE
5206-19376-0062 THOUGH IT SERVES WELL ENOUGH FOR THE CASE OF A BALL WHIRLED AT THE END OF AN ELASTIC STRING AFTER HAVING GOT UP THE WHIRL THE HAND HOLDING THE STRING MAY REMAIN ALMOST FIXED AT THE CENTRE OF THE CIRCLE AND THE MOTION WILL CONTINUE STEADILY
5206-19376-0063 BUT IF THE HAND BE MOVED SO AS ALWAYS TO PULL THE STRING A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF THE CENTRE
5206-19376-0064 THE ELASTIC WILL BE MORE AND MORE STRETCHED UNTIL THE WHIRLING BALL IS DESCRIBING A MUCH LARGER CIRCLE BUT IN THIS CASE IT WILL LIKEWISE BE GOING FASTER DISTANCE AND SPEED INCREASE TOGETHER
5206-19376-0065 WHICH PRACTICALLY STATES THAT THE FURTHER A PLANET IS FROM THE CENTRE THE SLOWER IT GOES ITS VELOCITY VARIES INVERSELY WITH THE SQUARE ROOT OF ITS DISTANCE
5206-19376-0066 IF INSTEAD OF A BALL HELD BY ELASTIC IT WERE A SATELLITE HELD BY GRAVITY AN INCREASE IN DISTANCE MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A DIMINUTION IN SPEED
5206-19376-0067 THE TIME OF REVOLUTION VARIES AS THE SQUARE OF THE CUBE ROOT OF THE DISTANCE KEPLER'S THIRD LAW HENCE THE TIDAL REACTION ON THE MOON
5206-19376-0068 THE PULLING THE MOON A LITTLE FORWARD HAS ALSO THE SECONDARY OR INDIRECT EFFECT OF MAKING IT MOVE SLOWER AND GO FURTHER OFF IT MAY SEEM STRANGE THAT AN ACCELERATING PULL DIRECTED IN FRONT OF THE CENTRE
5206-19376-0069 AND THEREFORE ALWAYS PULLING THE MOON THE WAY IT IS GOING SHOULD RETARD IT AND THAT A RETARDING FORCE LIKE FRICTION IF SUCH A FORCE ACTED SHOULD HASTEN IT AND MAKE IT COMPLETE ITS ORBIT SOONER BUT SO IT PRECISELY IS
5206-19376-0070 GRADUALLY BUT VERY SLOWLY THE MOON IS RECEDING FROM US AND THE MONTH IS BECOMING LONGER THE TIDES OF THE EARTH ARE PUSHING IT AWAY THIS IS NOT A PERIODIC DISTURBANCE LIKE THE TEMPORARY ACCELERATION OF ITS MOTION DISCOVERED BY LAPLACE
5206-19376-0071 WORKING BACKWARDS ALSO WE SEE THAT IN PAST AGES THE MOON MUST HAVE BEEN NEARER TO US THAN IT IS NOW AND THE MONTH SHORTER
5206-19376-0072 NOW JUST NOTE WHAT THE EFFECT OF THE INCREASED NEARNESS OF THE MOON WAS UPON OUR TIDES REMEMBER THAT THE TIDE GENERATING FORCE VARIES INVERSELY AS THE CUBE OF DISTANCE
5206-19376-0073 THE EARTH'S TIDES WOULD HAVE BEEN TWICE AS HIGH AS THEY ARE NOW THE PUSHING AWAY ACTION WAS THEN A GOOD DEAL MORE VIOLENT AND SO THE PROCESS WENT ON QUICKER THE MOON MUST AT SOME TIME HAVE BEEN JUST HALF ITS PRESENT DISTANCE
5206-19376-0074 WE HAVE THE MOON AT ONE THIRD OF ITS PRESENT DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH AND THE TIDES SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH NOW JUST CONTEMPLATE THE EFFECT OF A SIX HUNDRED FOOT TIDE WE ARE HERE ONLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA
5206-19376-0075 HENCE THE TIDE WOULD SWEEP RIGHT OVER US AND RUSH FAR AWAY INLAND AT HIGH TIDE WE SHOULD HAVE SOME TWO HUNDRED FEET OF BLUE WATER OVER OUR HEADS THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO STOP SUCH A TIDE AS THAT IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
5206-19376-0076 TILL IT REACHED THE HIGH LANDS OF DERBYSHIRE MANCHESTER WOULD BE A SEAPORT THEN WITH A VENGEANCE THE DAY WAS SHORTER THEN AND SO THE INTERVAL BETWEEN TIDE AND TIDE WAS MORE LIKE TEN THAN TWELVE HOURS ACCORDINGLY
5206-19376-0077 IN ABOUT FIVE HOURS ALL THAT MASS OF WATER
5206-19376-0078 AND GREAT TRACTS OF SAND BETWEEN HERE AND IRELAND WOULD BE LEFT DRY ANOTHER FIVE HOURS AND THE WATER WOULD COME TEARING AND DRIVING OVER THE COUNTRY APPLYING ITS FURIOUS WAVES AND CURRENTS TO THE WORK OF DENUDATION WHICH WOULD PROCEED APACE
5206-19376-0079 THAT ARE OF THE MOST PORTENTOUS THICKNESS
5206-19376-0080 SIR ROBERT BALL BELIEVES AND SEVERAL GEOLOGISTS AGREE WITH HIM THAT THE MIGHTY TIDES WE ARE CONTEMPLATING MAY HAVE BEEN COAEVAL WITH THIS ANCIENT LAURENTIAN FORMATION AND OTHERS OF LIKE NATURE WITH IT
5206-19376-0081 BUT LET US LEAVE GEOLOGY NOW AND TRACE THE INVERTED PROGRESS OF EVENTS AS WE RECEDE IN IMAGINATION BACK THROUGH THE GEOLOGICAL ERA BEYOND
5206-19376-0082 WHEN THE MOON WAS STILL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE EARTH AND WAS REVOLVING ROUND IT QUICKER AND QUICKER BEFORE LIFE OR WATER EXISTED ON IT AND WHEN THE ROCKS WERE STILL MOLTEN SUPPOSE THE MOON ONCE TOUCHED THE EARTH'S SURFACE
5206-19376-0083 THE MONTH WAS ONLY THREE HOURS LONG AT THIS INITIAL EPOCH REMEMBER HOWEVER THE INITIAL LENGTH OF THE DAY WE FOUND THAT IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE FOR THE EARTH TO ROTATE ON ITS AXIS IN THREE HOURS AND THAT WHEN IT DID SO
5206-19376-0084 SOMETHING WAS LIABLE TO SEPARATE FROM IT HERE WE FIND THE MOON IN CONTACT WITH IT AND GOING ROUND IT IN THIS SAME THREE HOUR PERIOD SURELY THE TWO ARE CONNECTED
5206-19376-0085 THERE WAS NO MOON ONLY THE EARTH AS A MOLTEN GLOBE RAPIDLY SPINNING ON ITS AXIS SPINNING IN ABOUT THREE HOURS GRADUALLY BY REASON OF SOME DISTURBING CAUSES A PROTUBERANCE A SORT OF BUD FORMS AT ONE SIDE
5206-19376-0086 ONE ABOUT EIGHTY TIMES AS BIG AS THE OTHER THE BIGGER ONE WE NOW CALL EARTH THE SMALLER WE NOW CALL MOON ROUND AND ROUND THE TWO BODIES WENT PULLING EACH OTHER INTO TREMENDOUSLY ELONGATED OR PROLATE SHAPES
5206-19376-0087 AND SO THEY MIGHT HAVE GONE ON FOR A LONG TIME BUT THEY ARE UNSTABLE AND CANNOT GO ON THUS THEY MUST EITHER SEPARATE OR COLLAPSE SOME DISTURBING CAUSE ACTS AGAIN AND THE SMALLER MASS BEGINS TO REVOLVE LESS RAPIDLY
5206-19376-0088 TIDES AT ONCE BEGIN GIGANTIC TIDES OF MOLTEN LAVA HUNDREDS OF MILES HIGH TIDES NOT IN FREE OCEAN FOR THERE WAS NONE THEN BUT IN THE PASTY MASS OF THE ENTIRE EARTH IMMEDIATELY THE SERIES OF CHANGES I HAVE DESCRIBED BEGINS
5206-19376-0089 THE SPEED OF ROTATION GETS SLACKENED THE MOON'S MASS GETS PUSHED FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY AND ITS TIME OF REVOLUTION GROWS RAPIDLY LONGER THE CHANGES WENT ON RAPIDLY AT FIRST BECAUSE THE TIDES WERE SO GIGANTIC BUT GRADUALLY
5206-19376-0090 AND BY SLOW DEGREES THE BODIES GET MORE DISTANT AND THE RATE OF CHANGE MORE MODERATE UNTIL AFTER THE LAPSE OF AGES WE FIND THE DAY TWENTY FOUR HOURS LONG THE MOON TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND MILES DISTANT
5206-19376-0091 AND ONLY A FEW FEET HIGH THIS IS THE ERA WE CALL TO DAY THE PROCESS DOES NOT STOP HERE STILL THE STATELY MARCH OF EVENTS GOES ON AND THE EYE OF SCIENCE STRIVES TO PENETRATE INTO THE EVENTS OF THE FUTURE WITH THE SAME CLEARNESS
5206-19376-0092 NEITHER OF THESE BODIES ROTATING WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER THE TWO AS IF JOINED BY A BAR AND TOTAL CESSATION OF TIDE GENERATING ACTION BETWEEN THEM THE DATE OF THIS PERIOD IS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS OF YEARS HENCE
5206-19376-0093 BUT UNLESS SOME UNFORESEEN CATASTROPHE INTERVENES IT MUST ASSUREDLY COME YET NEITHER WILL EVEN THIS BE THE FINAL STAGE FOR THE SYSTEM IS DISTURBED BY THE TIDE GENERATING FORCE OF THE SUN IT IS A SMALL EFFECT
5206-19376-0094 WE ARE PRESENTED WITH A PICTURE OF THE MONTH GETTING GRADUALLY SHORTER THAN THE DAY THE MOON GRADUALLY APPROACHING INSTEAD OF RECEDING AND SO INCALCULABLE MYRIADS OF AGES HENCE PRECIPITATING ITSELF UPON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WHENCE IT AROSE
5206-19376-0095 SUCH A CATASTROPHE IS ALREADY IMMINENT IN A NEIGHBOURING PLANET MARS
5206-19376-0096 THE PLANET ROTATES IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AS WE DO BUT ITS TIDES ARE FOLLOWING ITS MOON MORE QUICKLY THAN IT ROTATES AFTER THEM THEY ARE THEREFORE TENDING TO INCREASE ITS RATE OF SPIN AND TO RETARD THE REVOLUTION OF THE MOON
5206-19376-0097 TO THAT WHICH SEPARATED OUR MOON THE DAY SHORTER THAN THE MONTH FORCES A MOON FURTHER AWAY THE MONTH SHORTER THAN THE DAY TENDS TO DRAW A SATELLITE NEARER THIS MOON OF MARS IS NOT A LARGE BODY
5206-19376-0098 IT IS ONLY TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES IN DIAMETER BUT IT WEIGHS SOME FORTY BILLION TONS AND WILL ULTIMATELY CRASH ALONG THE SURFACE WITH A VELOCITY OF EIGHT THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR SUCH A BLOW MUST PRODUCE THE MOST ASTOUNDING EFFECTS WHEN IT OCCURS
5206-19376-0099 AGENTS LIKE THOSE WE HAVE TRACED IN THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH AND MOON MUST BE AT WORK THE MOTION OF ALL MUST BE COMPLICATED BY THE PHENOMENA OF TIDES IT IS PROFESSOR GEORGE DARWIN
5206-19376-0100 WHO HAS WORKED OUT THE ASTRONOMICAL INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SIR WILLIAM THOMSON IT IS SIR ROBERT BALL
5206-19376-0101 EARTH ONE THOUSAND MARS THREE HUNDRED FOUR JUPITER TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX SATURN ONE THOUSAND AND THIRTY THREE URANUS TWENTY ONE NEPTUNE NINE
5206-19376-0102 THE POWER OF ALL OF THEM IS VERY FEEBLE AND BY ACTING ON DIFFERENT SIDES THEY USUALLY PARTLY NEUTRALIZE EACH OTHER'S ACTION BUT OCCASIONALLY THEY GET ALL ON ONE SIDE
5206-19376-0103 AND IN THAT CASE SOME PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT MAY BE PRODUCED THE PROBABLE EFFECT SEEMS LIKELY TO BE A GENTLE HEAVING TIDE IN THE SOLAR SURFACE WITH BREAKING UP OF ANY INCIPIENT CRUST
5206-19376-0104 AND SUCH AN EFFECT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS EVIDENCED PERIODICALLY BY THE GREAT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SOLAR SPOTS WHICH THEN BREAK OUT THE SOLAR TIDES ARE HOWEVER MUCH TOO SMALL TO APPRECIABLY PUSH ANY PLANET AWAY
5206-19376-0105 HENCE WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THAT THE PLANETS ORIGINATED BY BUDDING FROM THE SUN IN CONTRADICTION OF THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS NOR IS IT NECESSARY TO ASSUME THAT THE SATELLITES AS A CLASS ORIGINATED IN THE WAY OURS DID THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE DONE SO
5206-19376-0106 THEY WERE MORE PROBABLY SECONDARY RINGS OUR MOON DIFFERS FROM OTHER SATELLITES IN BEING EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE COMPARED WITH THE SIZE OF ITS PRIMARY IT IS AS BIG AS SOME OF THE MOONS OF JUPITER AND SATURN
5206-19376-0107 THE EARTH IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE SMALL PLANETS THAT HAS AN APPRECIABLE MOON AND HENCE THERE IS NOTHING FORCED OR UNNATURAL IN SUPPOSING THAT IT MAY HAVE HAD AN EXCEPTIONAL HISTORY EVIDENTLY HOWEVER TIDAL PHENOMENA MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
5206-19376-0108 IN ANY TREATMENT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM THROUGH ENORMOUS LENGTH OF TIME AND IT WILL PROBABLY PLAY A LARGE PART IN DETERMINING ITS FUTURE WHEN LAPLACE AND LAGRANGE INVESTIGATED THE QUESTION OF THE STABILITY OR INSTABILITY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
5206-19376-0109 THEY DID SO ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE BODIES COMPOSING IT WERE RIGID THEY REACHED A GRAND CONCLUSION THAT ALL THE MUTUAL PERTURBATIONS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM WERE PERIODIC THAT WHATEVER CHANGES WERE GOING ON
5206-19376-0110 AND THEN BEGIN TO DIMINISH THEN INCREASE AGAIN THEN DIMINISH AND SO ON
5206-19376-0111 BUT THIS CONCLUSION IS NOT FINAL THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE BODIES ARE RIGID IS NOT STRICTLY TRUE
5206-19376-0112 ABLE IN THE LONG RUN TO UPSET ALL THEIR CALCULATIONS
5206-19376-0113 WHEREAS THE ORDINARY PERTURBATIONS GO THROUGH THEIR SWINGS IN SOME HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS OR SO AT THE MOST GRANTED IT IS SMALL BUT IT IS TERRIBLY PERSISTENT AND IT ALWAYS ACTS IN ONE DIRECTION NEVER DOES IT CEASE
5206-19376-0114 NEVER DOES IT BEGIN TO ACT OPPOSITELY AND UNDO WHAT IT HAS DONE IT IS LIKE THE PERPETUAL DROPPING OF WATER THERE MAY BE ONLY ONE DROP IN A TWELVEMONTH BUT LEAVE IT LONG ENOUGH AND THE HARDEST STONE MUST BE WORN AWAY AT LAST
5206-19376-0115 WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF MILLIONS OF YEARS SOMEWHAT FAMILIARLY
5206-19376-0116 IT IS LONGER THAN OUR LIFETIME IT IS TRUE TO THE EPHEMERAL INSECTS WHOSE LIFETIME IS AN HOUR A YEAR MIGHT SEEM AN AWFUL PERIOD THE MID DAY SUN MIGHT SEEM AN ALMOST STATIONARY BODY THE CHANGES OF THE SEASONS WOULD BE UNKNOWN
5206-19376-0117 EVERYTHING BUT THE MOST FLEETING AND RAPID CHANGES WOULD APPEAR PERMANENT AND AT REST CONVERSELY IF OUR LIFE PERIOD EMBRACED MYRIADS OF AEONS THINGS WHICH NOW SEEM PERMANENT WOULD THEN APPEAR
5206-19376-0118 SOMETIMES COVERED WITH OCEAN THE STARS WE NOW CALL FIXED WOULD BE MOVING VISIBLY BEFORE OUR EYES THE EARTH WOULD BE HUMMING ON ITS AXIS LIKE A TOP AND THE WHOLE OF HUMAN HISTORY MIGHT SEEM AS FLEETING AS A CLOUD OF BREATH ON A MIRROR
5206-19376-0119 SHALL THE STATELY EVOLUTION OF THE PLANETARY ORBS THEMSELVES BE HURRIED IT MAY BE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TRACE THE HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM FOR SOME THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OR SO BUT FOR HOW MUCH LONGER TIME MUST IT NOT HAVE A HISTORY
5206-19376-0120 ENTIRELY BEYOND OUR KEN THOSE WHO STUDY THE STARS HAVE IMPRESSED UPON THEM THE EXISTENCE OF THE MOST IMMEASURABLE DISTANCES WHICH YET ARE SWALLOWED UP AS NOTHING IN THE INFINITUDE OF SPACE
