5684-46243-0000 AND BETWEEN THE DISTINCT SPECIES OF THE SAME GENUS NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING CHAPTER WILL BE DEVOTED TO THIS SUBJECT BUT I WILL FIRST MAKE A FEW REMARKS ON ONE OR TWO OTHER POINTS SEVERAL MALES MAY OFTEN BE SEEN PURSUING AND CROWDING ROUND THE SAME FEMALE
5684-46243-0001 THEIR COURTSHIP APPEARS TO BE A PROLONGED AFFAIR FOR I HAVE FREQUENTLY WATCHED ONE OR MORE MALES PIROUETTING ROUND A FEMALE UNTIL I WAS TIRED WITHOUT SEEING THE END OF THE COURTSHIP
5684-46243-0002 MISTER A G BUTLER ALSO INFORMS ME THAT HE HAS SEVERAL TIMES WATCHED A MALE COURTING A FEMALE FOR A FULL QUARTER OF AN HOUR BUT SHE PERTINACIOUSLY REFUSED HIM AND AT LAST SETTLED ON THE GROUND AND CLOSED HER WINGS
5684-46243-0003 AND WHICH CAN BE HEARD AT THE DISTANCE OF SEVERAL YARDS I NOTICED THIS SOUND AT RIO DE JANEIRO ONLY WHEN TWO OF THESE BUTTERFLIES WERE CHASING EACH OTHER IN AN IRREGULAR COURSE
5684-46243-0004 THAT SETINA PRODUCES A SOUND LIKE THE TICKING OF A WATCH APPARENTLY BY THE AID OF TWO LARGE TYMPANIFORM VESICLES SITUATED IN THE PECTORAL REGION AND THESE ARE MUCH MORE DEVELOPED IN THE MALE THAN IN THE FEMALE
5684-46243-0005 HENCE THE SOUND PRODUCING ORGANS IN THE LEPIDOPTERA APPEAR TO STAND IN SOME RELATION WITH THE SEXUAL FUNCTIONS I HAVE NOT ALLUDED TO THE WELL KNOWN NOISE MADE BY THE DEATH'S HEAD SPHINX
5684-46243-0006 AND IT MAY BE ASKED ARE THEIR COLOURS AND DIVERSIFIED PATTERNS THE RESULT OF THE DIRECT ACTION OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS TO WHICH THESE INSECTS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
5684-46243-0007 OR HAVE SUCCESSIVE VARIATIONS BEEN ACCUMULATED AND DETERMINED AS A PROTECTION OR FOR SOME UNKNOWN PURPOSE OR THAT ONE SEX MAY BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE OTHER
5684-46243-0008 AND ALIKE IN THE TWO SEXES OF OTHER SPECIES OF THE SAME GENUS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS A BODY OF FACTS MUST BE GIVEN
5684-46243-0009 AND THEY LIKEWISE RESEMBLE BOTH SEXES OF THE SPECIES IN SEVERAL ALLIED GENERA FOUND IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD HENCE WE MAY INFER THAT THESE NINE SPECIES AND PROBABLY ALL THE OTHERS OF THE GENUS ARE DESCENDED FROM AN ANCESTRAL FORM WHICH WAS COLOURED IN NEARLY THE SAME MANNER
5684-46243-0010 IN THE TENTH SPECIES THE FEMALE STILL RETAINS THE SAME GENERAL COLOURING BUT THE MALE RESEMBLES HER SO THAT HE IS COLOURED IN A MUCH LESS GAUDY AND CONTRASTED MANNER THAN THE MALES OF THE PREVIOUS SPECIES IN THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH SPECIES THE FEMALES DEPART FROM THE USUAL TYPE
5684-46243-0011 HENCE IN THESE TWO LATTER SPECIES THE BRIGHT COLOURS OF THE MALES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE FEMALES WHILST IN THE TENTH SPECIES THE MALE HAS EITHER RETAINED OR RECOVERED THE PLAIN COLOURS OF THE FEMALE AS WELL AS OF THE PARENT FORM OF THE GENUS
5684-46243-0012 THE SEXES IN THESE THREE CASES HAVE THUS BEEN RENDERED NEARLY ALIKE THOUGH IN AN OPPOSITE MANNER IN THE ALLIED GENUS EUBAGIS BOTH SEXES OF SOME OF THE SPECIES ARE PLAIN COLOURED AND NEARLY ALIKE
5684-46243-0013 AND DIFFER MUCH FROM THEIR FEMALES THE FEMALES THROUGHOUT THE GENUS RETAIN THE SAME GENERAL STYLE OF COLOURING SO THAT THEY RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER MUCH MORE CLOSELY THAN THEY RESEMBLE THEIR OWN MALES
5684-46243-0014 IN THE GENUS PAPILIO ALL THE SPECIES OF THE AENEAS GROUP ARE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR CONSPICUOUS AND STRONGLY CONTRASTED COLOURS AND THEY ILLUSTRATE THE FREQUENT TENDENCY TO GRADATION IN THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEXES
5684-46243-0015 IN OTHERS THE MALES ARE EITHER A LITTLE BRIGHTER OR VERY MUCH MORE SUPERB THAN THE FEMALES
5684-46243-0016 FOR ALTHOUGH THE SEXES OF MOST OF THE SPECIES RESEMBLE EACH OTHER
5684-46243-0017 THE MALE IS RATHER MORE BRIGHT COLOURED THAN THE FEMALE
5684-46243-0018 THE MALE IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE FEMALE THAT HE MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR AN ENTIRELY DISTINCT SPECIES ANOTHER STRIKING CASE WAS POINTED OUT TO ME IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM BY MISTER A BUTLER NAMELY ONE OF THE TROPICAL AMERICAN THECLAE
5684-46243-0019 IN WHICH BOTH SEXES ARE NEARLY ALIKE AND WONDERFULLY SPLENDID IN ANOTHER SPECIES THE MALE IS COLOURED IN A SIMILARLY GORGEOUS MANNER WHILST THE WHOLE UPPER SURFACE OF THE FEMALE IS OF A DULL UNIFORM BROWN OUR COMMON LITTLE ENGLISH BLUE BUTTERFLIES OF THE GENUS LYCAENA
5684-46243-0020 THOUGH NOT IN SO STRIKING A MANNER AS THE ABOVE EXOTIC GENERA
5684-46243-0021 BORDERED WITH SMALL OCELLATED ORANGE SPOTS AND ARE THUS ALIKE
5684-46243-0022 AND ARE VERY LIKE THOUGH IN THE FEMALE THE EDGES OF THE WINGS ARE RATHER DUSKIER WITH THE BLACK SPOTS PLAINER AND IN A BRIGHT BLUE INDIAN SPECIES BOTH SEXES ARE STILL MORE ALIKE
5684-46243-0023 THAT WHEN THE SEXES OF BUTTERFLIES DIFFER THE MALE AS A GENERAL RULE IS THE MORE BEAUTIFUL AND DEPARTS MORE FROM THE USUAL TYPE OF COLOURING OF THE GROUP TO WHICH THE SPECIES BELONGS HENCE IN MOST GROUPS THE FEMALES OF THE SEVERAL SPECIES RESEMBLE EACH OTHER MUCH MORE CLOSELY THAN DO THE MALES
5684-46243-0024 IN SOME CASES HOWEVER TO WHICH I SHALL HEREAFTER ALLUDE THE FEMALES ARE COLOURED MORE SPLENDIDLY THAN THE MALES IN THE SECOND PLACE THESE DETAILS HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO BRING CLEARLY BEFORE THE MIND
5684-46243-0025 TO SO GREAT A DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS LONG BEFORE THE TWO WERE PLACED BY ENTOMOLOGISTS IN THE SAME GENUS IN THE THIRD PLACE WE HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN THE SEXES NEARLY RESEMBLE EACH OTHER THIS APPEARS DUE EITHER TO THE MALE HAVING TRANSFERRED HIS COLOURS TO THE FEMALE
5684-46243-0026 OR TO THE MALE HAVING RETAINED OR PERHAPS RECOVERED
5684-46243-0027 IT ALSO DESERVES NOTICE THAT IN THOSE GROUPS IN WHICH THE SEXES DIFFER THE FEMALES USUALLY SOMEWHAT RESEMBLE THE MALES SO THAT WHEN THE MALES ARE BEAUTIFUL TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE
5684-46243-0028 ARE THE PURPOSELESS RESULT OF THE NATURE OF THE TISSUES AND OF THE ACTION OF THE SURROUNDING CONDITIONS
5684-46243-0029 THIS HAS BEEN AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE EITHER FOR DIRECT OR INDIRECT PROTECTION OR AS AN ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE SEXES WITH MANY SPECIES OF BUTTERFLIES THE UPPER SURFACES OF THE WINGS ARE OBSCURE AND THIS IN ALL PROBABILITY LEADS TO THEIR ESCAPING OBSERVATION AND DANGER
5684-46243-0030 BUT BUTTERFLIES WOULD BE PARTICULARLY LIABLE TO BE ATTACKED BY THEIR ENEMIES WHEN AT REST AND MOST KINDS WHILST RESTING RAISE THEIR WINGS VERTICALLY OVER THEIR BACKS SO THAT THE LOWER SURFACE ALONE IS EXPOSED TO VIEW
5684-46243-0031 AND YET ARE PROTECTIVE THUS IN THECLA RUBI THE WINGS WHEN CLOSED ARE OF AN EMERALD GREEN AND RESEMBLE THE YOUNG LEAVES OF THE BRAMBLE ON WHICH IN SPRING THIS BUTTERFLY MAY OFTEN BE SEEN SEATED
5684-46243-0032 IN THESE SPECIES BOTH SEXES ARE ALIKE BUT IN THE COMMON BRIMSTONE BUTTERFLY GONEPTERYX RHAMNI THE MALE IS OF AN INTENSE YELLOW WHILST THE FEMALE IS MUCH PALER
5684-46243-0033 AS A WARNING THAT THEY ARE UNPALATABLE FOR IN CERTAIN OTHER CASES BEAUTY HAS BEEN GAINED THROUGH THE IMITATION OF OTHER BEAUTIFUL SPECIES WHICH INHABIT THE SAME DISTRICT AND ENJOY AN IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY BEING IN SOME WAY OFFENSIVE TO THEIR ENEMIES
5684-46243-0034 BUT THEN WE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE IMITATED SPECIES AS MISTER WALSH HAS REMARKED TO ME THE FEMALES OF OUR ORANGE TIP BUTTERFLY ABOVE REFERRED TO
5684-46243-0035 FOR BOTH SEXES OF FOUR OR FIVE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED SPECIES ARE COLOURED IN NEARLY THE SAME MANNER AS IN SEVERAL PREVIOUS CASES WE MAY HERE INFER
5684-46243-0036 WHICH HAVE DEPARTED FROM THE USUAL TYPE OF THE GENUS
5684-46243-0037 THE ORANGE TIPS TO THE WINGS HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY DEVELOPED IN THE FEMALE BUT THEY ARE PALER THAN IN THE MALE
5684-46243-0038 AS THE HIND WINGS ARE THEN FULLY EXPOSED TO VIEW
5684-46243-0039 BUT THE FOLLOWING FACT SHEWS HOW CAUTIOUS WE OUGHT TO BE IN DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ON THIS HEAD THE COMMON YELLOW UNDER WINGS TRIPHAENA OFTEN FLY ABOUT DURING THE DAY OR EARLY EVENING
5684-46243-0040 IT WOULD NATURALLY BE THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE A SOURCE OF DANGER BUT MISTER J JENNER WEIR BELIEVES THAT IT ACTUALLY SERVES THEM AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE FOR BIRDS STRIKE AT THESE BRIGHTLY COLOURED AND FRAGILE SURFACES INSTEAD OF AT THE BODY
5684-46243-0041 FOR INSTANCE MISTER WEIR TURNED INTO HIS AVIARY A VIGOROUS SPECIMEN OF TRIPHAENA PRONUBA WHICH WAS INSTANTLY PURSUED BY A ROBIN BUT THE BIRD'S ATTENTION BEING CAUGHT BY THE COLOURED WINGS
5684-46243-0042 ARE SPECIALLY ARRANGED FOR DISPLAY SO THAT THEY MAY BE READILY SEEN DURING THE NIGHT COLOURS ARE NOT VISIBLE AND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE NOCTURNAL MOTHS TAKEN AS A BODY ARE MUCH LESS GAILY DECORATED THAN BUTTERFLIES ALL OF WHICH ARE DIURNAL IN THEIR HABITS
5684-46243-0043 FLY ABOUT DURING THE DAY OR EARLY EVENING
5684-46243-0044 YET IN MANY SPECIES IT IS AS HIGHLY DECORATED AS THE UPPER SURFACE
5684-46243-0045 IS COLOURED MORE BRIGHTLY AND DIVERSELY THAN THE LOWER HENCE THE LOWER SURFACE GENERALLY AFFORDS TO ENTOMOLOGISTS THE MORE USEFUL CHARACTER FOR DETECTING THE AFFINITIES OF THE VARIOUS SPECIES FRITZ MUELLER INFORMS ME THAT THREE SPECIES OF CASTNIA
5684-46243-0046 OF TWO OF THEM THE HIND WINGS ARE OBSCURE AND ARE ALWAYS COVERED BY THE FRONT WINGS WHEN THESE BUTTERFLIES ARE AT REST BUT THE THIRD SPECIES HAS BLACK HIND WINGS BEAUTIFULLY SPOTTED WITH RED AND WHITE AND THESE ARE FULLY EXPANDED AND DISPLAYED WHENEVER THE BUTTERFLY RESTS
5684-46243-0047 OTHER SUCH CASES COULD BE ADDED IF WE NOW TURN TO THE ENORMOUS GROUP OF MOTHS WHICH AS I HEAR FROM MISTER STAINTON
5684-46243-0048 THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE FORE WING IS PALE GREYISH OCHREOUS WHILE THE LOWER SURFACE IS MAGNIFICENTLY ORNAMENTED BY AN OCELLUS OF COBALT BLUE PLACED IN THE MIDST OF A BLACK MARK SURROUNDED BY ORANGE YELLOW AND THIS BY BLUISH WHITE BUT THE HABITS OF THESE THREE MOTHS ARE UNKNOWN
5684-46243-0049 NOW AND THEN SUDDENLY AND SLIGHTLY LIFT UP THEIR WINGS HENCE THE LOWER SURFACE OF THE WINGS BEING BRIGHTER THAN THE UPPER SURFACE IN CERTAIN MOTHS IS NOT SO ANOMALOUS AS IT AT FIRST APPEARS THE SATURNIIDAE INCLUDE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL MOTHS
5684-46243-0050 THEIR WINGS BEING DECORATED AS IN OUR BRITISH EMPEROR MOTH
5684-46243-0051 RESEMBLES THE VERY COMMON SPILOSOMA MENTHRASTI BOTH SEXES OF WHICH ARE WHITE AND MISTER STAINTON OBSERVED THAT THIS LATTER MOTH WAS REJECTED WITH UTTER DISGUST BY A WHOLE BROOD OF YOUNG TURKEYS WHICH WERE FOND OF EATING OTHER MOTHS
5684-46243-0052 FROM THE SEVERAL FOREGOING FACTS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMIT THAT THE BRILLIANT COLOURS OF BUTTERFLIES AND OF SOME FEW MOTHS HAVE COMMONLY BEEN ACQUIRED FOR THE SAKE OF PROTECTION
5684-46243-0053 HENCE I AM LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE FEMALES PREFER OR ARE MOST EXCITED BY THE MORE BRILLIANT MALES FOR ON ANY OTHER SUPPOSITION THE MALES WOULD AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE BE ORNAMENTED TO NO PURPOSE WE KNOW THAT ANTS AND CERTAIN LAMELLICORN BEETLES ARE CAPABLE OF FEELING AN ATTACHMENT FOR EACH OTHER
5684-46243-0054 AND THAT ANTS RECOGNISE THEIR FELLOWS AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SEVERAL MONTHS HENCE THERE IS NO ABSTRACT IMPROBABILITY IN THE LEPIDOPTERA WHICH PROBABLY STAND NEARLY OR QUITE AS HIGH IN THE SCALE AS THESE INSECTS
5684-46243-0055 THEY CERTAINLY DISCOVER FLOWERS BY COLOUR THE HUMMING BIRD SPHINX MAY OFTEN BE SEEN TO SWOOP DOWN FROM A DISTANCE ON A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN THE MIDST OF GREEN FOLIAGE AND I HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY TWO PERSONS ABROAD THAT THESE MOTHS REPEATEDLY VISIT FLOWERS PAINTED ON THE WALLS OF A ROOM
5684-46243-0056 AND VAINLY ENDEAVOUR TO INSERT THEIR PROBOSCIS INTO THEM
5684-46243-0057 HE OBSERVED THAT THEY VERY OFTEN VISITED THE BRILLIANT RED FLOWERS OF FIVE OR SIX GENERA OF PLANTS BUT NEVER THE WHITE OR YELLOW FLOWERING SPECIES OF THE SAME AND OTHER GENERA GROWING IN THE SAME GARDEN AND I HAVE RECEIVED OTHER ACCOUNTS TO THE SAME EFFECT
5684-46243-0058 AS I HEAR FROM MISTER DOUBLEDAY THE COMMON WHITE BUTTERFLY OFTEN FLIES DOWN TO A BIT OF PAPER ON THE GROUND
5684-46243-0059 THE MALES SOMETIMES FIGHT TOGETHER IN RIVALRY AND MANY MAY BE SEEN PURSUING OR CROWDING ROUND THE SAME FEMALE UNLESS THEN THE FEMALES PREFER ONE MALE TO ANOTHER THE PAIRING MUST BE LEFT TO MERE CHANCE AND THIS DOES NOT APPEAR PROBABLE
5684-46243-0060 AND WILL HAVE BEEN TRANSMITTED TO BOTH SEXES OR TO ONE SEX ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF INHERITANCE WHICH HAS PREVAILED THE PROCESS OF SEXUAL SELECTION WILL HAVE BEEN MUCH FACILITATED IF THE CONCLUSION CAN BE TRUSTED ARRIVED AT FROM VARIOUS KINDS OF EVIDENCE IN THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE NINTH CHAPTER
5684-46243-0061 NAMELY THAT THE MALES OF MANY LEPIDOPTERA AT LEAST IN THE IMAGO STATE GREATLY EXCEED THE FEMALES IN NUMBER SOME FACTS HOWEVER ARE OPPOSED TO THE BELIEF THAT FEMALE BUTTERFLIES PREFER THE MORE BEAUTIFUL MALES
5684-46243-0062 THUS AS I HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY SEVERAL COLLECTORS FRESH FEMALES MAY FREQUENTLY BE SEEN PAIRED WITH BATTERED FADED OR DINGY MALES BUT THIS IS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH COULD HARDLY FAIL OFTEN TO FOLLOW FROM THE MALES EMERGING FROM THEIR COCOONS EARLIER THAN THE FEMALES
5684-46243-0063 THE SEXES PAIR IMMEDIATELY AFTER ASSUMING THE IMAGO STATE FOR THEY CANNOT FEED OWING TO THE RUDIMENTARY CONDITION OF THEIR MOUTHS THE FEMALES AS SEVERAL ENTOMOLOGISTS HAVE REMARKED TO ME LIE IN AN ALMOST TORPID STATE AND APPEAR NOT TO EVINCE THE LEAST CHOICE IN REGARD TO THEIR PARTNERS
5684-46243-0064 AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SOME CONTINENTAL AND ENGLISH BREEDERS DOCTOR WALLACE WHO HAS HAD GREAT EXPERIENCE IN BREEDING BOMBYX CYNTHIA IS CONVINCED THAT THE FEMALES EVINCE NO CHOICE OR PREFERENCE HE HAS KEPT ABOVE THREE HUNDRED OF THESE MOTHS TOGETHER
5684-46243-0065 AND HAS OFTEN FOUND THE MOST VIGOROUS FEMALES MATED WITH STUNTED MALES THE REVERSE APPEARS TO OCCUR SELDOM FOR AS HE BELIEVES THE MORE VIGOROUS MALES PASS OVER THE WEAKLY FEMALES AND ARE ATTRACTED BY THOSE ENDOWED WITH MOST VITALITY
