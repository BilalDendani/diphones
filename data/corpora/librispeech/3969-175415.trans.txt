3969-175415-0000 EXPEDICAO SCIENTIFICA ROOSEVELT RONDON
3969-175415-0001 IT WAS TO MAKE AN EXPEDITION PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH MAMMALOGY AND ORNITHOLOGY FOR THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY OF NEW YORK THIS WAS UNDERTAKEN UNDER THE AUSPICES OF MESSRS OSBORN AND CHAPMAN
3969-175415-0002 IN THE BODY OF THIS WORK I DESCRIBE HOW THE SCOPE OF THE EXPEDITION WAS ENLARGED AND HOW IT WAS GIVEN A GEOGRAPHIC AS WELL AS A ZOOLOGICAL CHARACTER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE KIND PROPOSAL OF THE BRAZILIAN SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS GENERAL LAURO MULLER
3969-175415-0003 IN ITS ALTERED AND ENLARGED FORM THE EXPEDITION WAS RENDERED POSSIBLE ONLY BY THE GENEROUS ASSISTANCE OF THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT THROUGHOUT THE BODY OF THE WORK WILL BE FOUND REFERENCE AFTER REFERENCE TO MY COLLEAGUES AND COMPANIONS OF THE EXPEDITION
3969-175415-0004 WHOSE SERVICES TO SCIENCE I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO SET FORTH AND FOR WHOM I SHALL ALWAYS FEEL THE MOST CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP AND REGARD THEODORE ROOSEVELT SAGAMORE HILL SEPTEMBER FIRST NINETEEN FOURTEEN
3969-175415-0005 FATHER ZAHM A PRIEST WHOM I KNEW CAME IN TO CALL ON ME FATHER ZAHM AND I HAD BEEN CRONIES FOR SOME TIME BECAUSE WE WERE BOTH OF US FOND OF DANTE AND OF HISTORY AND OF SCIENCE I HAD ALWAYS COMMENDED TO THEOLOGIANS HIS BOOK
3969-175415-0006 EVOLUTION AND DOGMA HE WAS AN OHIO BOY AND HIS EARLY SCHOOLING HAD BEEN OBTAINED IN OLD TIME AMERICAN FASHION IN A LITTLE LOG SCHOOL WHERE BY THE WAY ONE OF THE OTHER BOYS WAS JANUARIUS
3969-175415-0007 AFTERWARD THE FAMOUS WAR CORRESPONDENT AND FRIEND OF SKOBELOFF FATHER ZAHM TOLD ME THAT MAC GAHAN EVEN AT THAT TIME ADDED AN UTTER FEARLESSNESS TO CHIVALRIC TENDERNESS FOR THE WEAK
3969-175415-0008 AND WAS THE DEFENDER OF ANY SMALL BOY WHO WAS OPPRESSED BY A LARGER ONE LATER FATHER ZAHM WAS AT NOTRE DAME UNIVERSITY IN INDIANA WITH MAURICE EGAN WHOM WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT I APPOINTED MINISTER TO DENMARK
3969-175415-0009 ON THE OCCASION IN QUESTION FATHER ZAHM HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A TRIP ACROSS THE ANDES AND DOWN THE AMAZON AND CAME IN TO PROPOSE THAT AFTER I LEFT THE PRESIDENCY HE AND I SHOULD GO UP THE PARAGUAY INTO THE INTERIOR OF SOUTH AMERICA
3969-175415-0010 AT THE TIME I WISHED TO GO TO AFRICA AND SO THE SUBJECT WAS DROPPED BUT FROM TIME TO TIME AFTERWARD WE TALKED IT OVER FIVE YEARS LATER IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN THIRTEEN I ACCEPTED INVITATIONS CONVEYED THROUGH THE GOVERNMENTS OF ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL
3969-175415-0011 TO ADDRESS CERTAIN LEARNED BODIES IN THESE COUNTRIES THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT INSTEAD OF MAKING THE CONVENTIONAL TOURIST TRIP PURELY BY SEA ROUND SOUTH AMERICA AFTER I HAD FINISHED MY LECTURES I WOULD COME NORTH THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE CONTINENT
3969-175415-0012 INTO THE VALLEY OF THE AMAZON AND I DECIDED TO WRITE FATHER ZAHM AND TELL HIM MY INTENTIONS BEFORE DOING SO HOWEVER I DESIRED TO SEE THE AUTHORITIES OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
3969-175415-0013 TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEY CARED TO HAVE ME TAKE A COUPLE OF NATURALISTS WITH ME INTO BRAZIL AND MAKE A COLLECTING TRIP FOR THE MUSEUM ACCORDINGLY I WROTE TO FRANK CHAPMAN
3969-175415-0014 THE CURATOR OF ORNITHOLOGY OF THE MUSEUM AND ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION TO LUNCH AT THE MUSEUM ONE DAY EARLY IN JUNE AT THE LUNCH IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS NATURALISTS TO MY ASTONISHMENT I ALSO FOUND FATHER ZAHM
3969-175415-0015 AND AS SOON AS I SAW HIM I TOLD HIM I WAS NOW INTENDING TO MAKE THE SOUTH AMERICAN TRIP IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT HIMSELF
3969-175415-0016 BECAUSE MUCH OF THE GROUND OVER WHICH WE WERE TO PASS HAD NOT BEEN COVERED BY COLLECTORS HE SAW HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN THE PRESIDENT OF THE MUSEUM WHO WROTE ME THAT THE MUSEUM WOULD BE PLEASED TO SEND UNDER ME A COUPLE OF NATURALISTS
3969-175415-0017 WHOM WITH MY APPROVAL CHAPMAN WOULD CHOOSE THE MEN WHOM CHAPMAN RECOMMENDED WERE MESSRS GEORGE K CHERRIE AND LEO E MILLER I GLADLY ACCEPTED BOTH THE FORMER WAS TO ATTEND CHIEFLY TO THE ORNITHOLOGY

3969-175415-0021 ONE NIGHT A FEW WEEKS LATER THEY WERE OBLIGED TO LEAVE A CAMPING PLACE WHERE THEY HAD INTENDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT BECAUSE THE BABY WAS FRETFUL AND ITS CRIES ATTRACTED A JAGUAR WHICH PROWLED NEARER AND NEARER IN THE TWILIGHT UNTIL THEY THOUGHT IT SAFEST

3969-175415-0030 IN ITS COMPOSITION OURS WAS A TYPICAL AMERICAN EXPEDITION KERMIT AND I WERE OF THE OLD REVOLUTIONARY STOCK

3969-175415-0034 FIALA A BAPTIST SIGG A LUTHERAN
3969-175415-0035 FOR ARMS THE NATURALISTS TOOK SIXTEEN BORE SHOTGUNS ONE OF CHERRIE'S HAVING A RIFLE BARREL UNDERNEATH
3969-175415-0036 INCLUDING MY SPRINGFIELD RIFLE KERMIT'S TWO WINCHESTERS
3969-175415-0037 THE FOX TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN AND ANOTHER SIXTEEN GAUGE GUN AND A COUPLE OF REVOLVERS A COLT AND A SMITH AND WESSON

3969-175415-0040 ONE PAIR OF HOB NAILED SHOES WITH LEGGINGS AND ONE PAIR OF LACED LEATHER BOOTS COMING NEARLY TO THE KNEE
3969-175415-0041 MADE UP BY FIALA THE TRIP I PROPOSED TO TAKE CAN BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY IF THERE IS A SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE OF SOUTH AMERICAN TOPOGRAPHY THE GREAT MOUNTAIN CHAIN OF THE ANDES EXTENDS DOWN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE WESTERN COAST
3969-175415-0042 SOUTHERNMOST SOUTH AMERICA INCLUDING OVER HALF OF THE TERRITORY OF THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC CONSISTS CHIEFLY OF A COOL OPEN PLAINS COUNTRY NORTHWARD OF THIS COUNTRY AND EASTWARD OF THE ANDES
3969-175415-0043 LIES THE GREAT BULK OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENT WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE TROPICAL AND THE SUBTROPICAL REGIONS MOST OF THIS TERRITORY IS BRAZILIAN ASIDE FROM CERTAIN RELATIVELY SMALL STRETCHES DRAINED BY COAST RIVERS
3969-175415-0044 THIS IMMENSE REGION OF TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL AMERICA EAST OF THE ANDES IS DRAINED BY THE THREE GREAT RIVER SYSTEMS OF THE PLATE THE AMAZON AND THE ORINOCO
3969-175415-0045 AT THEIR HEADWATERS THE AMAZON AND THE ORINOCO SYSTEMS ARE ACTUALLY CONNECTED BY A SLUGGISH NATURAL CANAL THE HEADWATERS OF THE NORTHERN AFFLUENTS OF THE PARAGUAY AND THE SOUTHERN AFFLUENTS OF THE AMAZON
3969-175415-0046 ARE SUNDERED BY A STRETCH OF HIGH LAND WHICH TOWARD THE EAST BROADENS OUT INTO THE CENTRAL PLATEAU OF BRAZIL GEOLOGICALLY THIS IS A VERY ANCIENT REGION HAVING APPEARED ABOVE THE WATERS BEFORE THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF REPTILES
3969-175415-0047 OR INDEED OF ANY TRUE LAND VERTEBRATES ON THE GLOBE THIS PLATEAU IS A REGION PARTLY OF HEALTHY RATHER DRY AND SANDY OPEN PRAIRIE PARTLY OF FOREST THE GREAT AND LOW LYING BASIN OF THE PARAGUAY
3969-175415-0048 WHICH BORDERS IT ON THE SOUTH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND THE STILL GREATER BASIN OF THE AMAZON WHICH BORDERS IT ON THE NORTH IS THE VERY LARGEST OF ALL THE RIVER BASINS OF THE EARTH IN THESE BASINS BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE BASIN OF THE AMAZON
3969-175415-0049 LIE THE MOST EXTENSIVE STRETCHES OF TROPICAL FOREST TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE THE FORESTS OF TROPICAL WEST AFRICA AND OF PORTIONS OF THE FARTHER INDIAN REGION ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN BE COMPARED WITH THEM
3969-175415-0050 MUCH DIFFICULTY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED IN EXPLORING THESE FORESTS BECAUSE UNDER THE TORRENTIAL RAINS AND STEAMING HEAT THE RANK GROWTH OF VEGETATION BECOMES ALMOST IMPENETRABLE AND THE STREAMS DIFFICULT OF NAVIGATION
3969-175415-0051 WHILE WHITE MEN SUFFER MUCH FROM THE TERRIBLE INSECT SCOURGES AND THE DEADLY DISEASES WHICH MODERN SCIENCE HAS DISCOVERED TO BE DUE VERY LARGELY TO INSECT BITES THE FAUNA AND FLORA HOWEVER ARE OF GREAT INTEREST
3969-175415-0052 OUR PURPOSE WAS TO ASCEND THE PARAGUAY AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE HEAD OF NAVIGATION THENCE CROSS TO THE SOURCES OF ONE OF THE AFFLUENTS OF THE AMAZON AND IF POSSIBLE DESCEND IT IN CANOES BUILT ON THE SPOT
3969-175415-0053 THE PARAGUAY IS REGULARLY NAVIGATED AS HIGH AS BOATS CAN GO
3969-175415-0054 IN THE STATE OF PARAGUAY MY EXACT PLAN OF OPERATIONS WAS NECESSARILY A LITTLE INDEFINITE
3969-175415-0055 WHO HAD BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE GREAT PERSONAL INTEREST IN MY TRIP INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD ARRANGED THAT ON THE HEADWATERS OF THE PARAGUAY AT THE TOWN OF CACERES I WOULD BE MET BY A BRAZILIAN ARMY COLONEL HIMSELF CHIEFLY INDIAN BY BLOOD
3969-175415-0056 COLONEL RONDON COLONEL RONDON HAS BEEN FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY THE FOREMOST EXPLORER OF THE BRAZILIAN HINTERLAND
3969-175415-0057 IF I CARED TO UNDERTAKE THE LEADERSHIP OF A SERIOUS EXPEDITION INTO THE UNEXPLORED PORTION OF WESTERN MATTO GROSSO
3969-175415-0058 AND TO ATTEMPT THE DESCENT OF A RIVER WHICH FLOWED NOBODY KNEW WHITHER BUT WHICH THE BEST INFORMED MEN BELIEVED WOULD PROVE TO BE A VERY BIG RIVER UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO GEOGRAPHERS I EAGERLY AND GLADLY ACCEPTED FOR I FELT
3969-175415-0059 THAT WITH SUCH HELP THE TRIP COULD BE MADE OF MUCH SCIENTIFIC VALUE
3969-175415-0060 ACCORDINGLY IT WAS ARRANGED THAT COLONEL RONDON AND SOME ASSISTANTS AND SCIENTISTS SHOULD MEET ME AT OR BELOW CORUMBA AND THAT WE SHOULD ATTEMPT THE DESCENT OF THE RIVER
