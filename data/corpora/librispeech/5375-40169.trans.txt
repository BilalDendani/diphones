5375-40169-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE VIRGINIA CHANGES HER MIND WHAT THE VANQUISHED SOPHOMORES THOUGHT OF THE TRICK THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED ON THEM WAS A MATTER FOR SPECULATION ONCE BACK IN OVERTON THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION HAD DAWNED UPON THEM
5375-40169-0001 THEIR COMMON SENSE TOLD THEM THAT REAL GHOSTS IF THERE WERE ANY NEVER CONGREGATED IN COMPANIES THE SIZE OF THE ONE THAT HAD RISEN TO HAUNT THEM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT OBVIOUSLY SOME ONE HAD OVERHEARD THEIR PLAN TO PICNIC AT HUNTER'S ROCK
5375-40169-0002 AND TREATED THEM TO AN UNWELCOME SURPRISE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ANY ONE OF THEM UNTIL THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOUSES THAT THEY HAD LEFT J ELFREDA LOCKED IN THE HAUNTED ABODE OF THE TWO BROTHERS
5375-40169-0003 DIRECTLY AFTER CHAPEL THE NEXT MORNING EIGHT YOUNG WOMEN WERE TO BE SEEN IN AN ANXIOUS GROUP JUST OUTSIDE THE CHAPEL SEVERAL FRESHMEN AND TWO OR THREE JUNIORS GLANCED APPRAISINGLY AT THEM THEN PASSED ON
5375-40169-0004 DID YOU NOTICE THE WAY THAT MISS WELLS LOOKED AT ME THIS MORNING MUTTERED MARY HAMPTON TO HER SATELLITES NEVER MIND A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT SNAPPED ALBERTA WICKS THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS J ELFREDA
5375-40169-0005 NONSENSE BERT SCOFFED ONE OF THE SOPHOMORES YOU ARE NERVOUS WE MAY NOT BE FOUND OUT FOUND OUT J ELFREDA WILL BE RAGING SHE'LL GO STRAIGHT TO THE DEAN THE MINUTE SHE IS FREE
5375-40169-0006 WHAT MADE YOU LOCK HER IN THERE THEN IF YOU WERE AFRAID SHE'D TELL ASKED ONE OF THE OTHERS RATHER SARCASTICALLY YES THAT'S WHAT I SAY EXCLAIMED A SECOND THIS AFFAIR HAS BEEN VERY SILLY FROM START TO FINISH
5375-40169-0007 I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF FOR HAVING BEEN DRAWN INTO IT AND IN FUTURE YOU MAY COUNT ME OUT OF ANY MORE SUCH STUNTS YOU GIRLS DON'T UNDERSTAND DECLARED ALBERTA WICKS ANGRILY WE ONLY MEANT TO EVEN AN OLD SCORE WITH THE BRIGGS PERSON
5375-40169-0008 WE WERE GOING TO CALL FOR HER ON THE WAY HOME AND TELL HER THAT WE HAD EVENED OUR SCORE
5375-40169-0009 SHE KNEW THAT WE'D MAKE LIFE MISERABLE FOR HER NEXT YEAR IF SHE DID SHE WOULDN'T TELL A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT BUT TO LEAVE HER THERE ALL NIGHT THAT REALLY WAS DREADFUL
5375-40169-0010 IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THERE GOES MISS BRIGGS NOW EXCLAIMED A GIRL WHO HAD BEEN IDLY WATCHING THE STUDENTS AS THEY PASSED OUT OF THE CHAPEL
5375-40169-0011 THE SOPHOMORE POINTED YES IT IS J ELFREDA ALMOST WAILED ALBERTA WICKS I'M GOING STRAIGHT BACK TO STUART HALL AND PACK MY TRUNK COME ON MARY
5375-40169-0012 BETTER WAIT A LITTLE DRYLY ADVISED THE SOPHOMORE WHO HAD ANNOUNCED HER DISAPPROVAL OF THE NIGHT'S ESCAPADE YOU MAY BE SORRY IF YOU DON'T
5375-40169-0013 NOW THAT J ELFREDA IS AMONG US
5375-40169-0014 SHE HURRIED AWAY FOLLOWED BY MARY HAMPTON THAT WAS MY FIRST AND IF I GET SAFELY OUT OF THIS WILL BE MY LAST OFFENSE SAID ANOTHER SOPHOMORE FIRMLY ALL THOSE WHO AGREE WITH ME SAY AYE FIVE AYES WERE SPOKEN SIMULTANEOUSLY
5375-40169-0015 IN THE MEANTIME GRACE WAS TRYING VAINLY TO MAKE UP HER MIND WHAT TO DO SHOULD SHE GO DIRECTLY TO THE TWO MISCHIEVOUS SOPHOMORES REVEALING THE IDENTITY OF THE GHOSTS OR SHOULD SHE LEAVE THEM IN A QUANDARY AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THEIR UNWOMANLY TRICK
5375-40169-0016 ONE THING HAD BEEN DECIDED UPON DEFINITELY BY GRACE AND HER FRIENDS THEY WOULD TELL NO TALES GRACE COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT A LITTLE ANXIETY WOULD BE THE JUST DUE OF THE PLOTTERS
5375-40169-0017 AND THAT PERSON WAS ELFREDA GRACE HAD FORGOTTEN TO TELL HER THAT THE NIGHT'S HAPPENINGS WERE TO BE KEPT A SECRET
5375-40169-0018 SHE PURSUED THEM WITH THE AIR OF AN AVENGER BEFORE THEY REALIZED HER PRESENCE SHE HAD BEGUN A FURIOUS ARRAIGNMENT OF THEIR TREACHERY YOU OUGHT TO BE SENT HOME FOR IT SHE CONCLUDED SAVAGELY AND IF GRACE HARLOWE WASN'T
5375-40169-0019 GRACE HARLOWE EXCLAIMED ALBERTA TURNING PALE DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT IT WAS SHE WHO PLANNED THAT GHOST PARTY I SHALL TELL YOU NOTHING RETORTED ELFREDA I'M SORRY I SAID EVEN THAT MUCH I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH THAT IF YOU EVER TRY TO PLAY A TRICK ON ME AGAIN
5375-40169-0020 JUST REMEMBER THAT AND MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS STRICTLY FROM NOW ON TURNING ON HER HEEL THE STOUT GIRL MARCHED OFF
5375-40169-0021 HAD WE BETTER GO AND SEE MISS HARLOWE ASKED MARY HAMPTON RATHER UNSTEADILY THE QUESTION IS DO WE CARE TO COME BACK HERE NEXT YEAR RETURNED ALBERTA GRIMLY I'D LIKE TO COME BACK SAID MARY IN A LOW VOICE
5375-40169-0022 I DON'T KNOW WAS THE PERVERSE ANSWER I DON'T WISH TO HUMBLE MYSELF TO ANY ONE I'M GOING TO TAKE A CHANCE ON HER KEEPING QUIET ABOUT LAST NIGHT I HAVE AN IDEA SHE IS NOT A TELLTALE IF WORSE COMES TO WORST THERE ARE OTHER COLLEGES YOU KNOW MARY
5375-40169-0023 I THOUGHT PERHAPS IF WE WERE TO GO TO MISS HARLOWE WE MIGHT STRAIGHTEN OUT MATTERS AND BE FRIENDS SAID MARY RATHER HESITATINGLY THOSE GIRLS HAVE NICE TIMES TOGETHER AND THEY ARE THE CLEVEREST CROWD IN THE FRESHMAN CLASS
5375-40169-0024 I'M TIRED OF BEING AT SWORD'S POINTS WITH PEOPLE THEN GO OVER TO THEM BY ALL MEANS SNEERED ALBERTA DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT YOUR OLD FRIENDS THEY DON'T COUNT
5375-40169-0025 IT WAS SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE MARY SUCCEEDED IN CONCILIATING HER SULKY FRIEND BY THAT TIME THE TINY SPROUTS OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP THAT HAD VAINLY TRIED TO POKE THEIR HEADS UP
5375-40169-0026 INTO THE LIGHT HAD BEEN HOPELESSLY BLIGHTED BY THE CHILLING RECEPTION THEY MET WITH AND MARY HAD AGAIN BEEN WON OVER TO ALBERTA'S SIDE
5375-40169-0027 AND ELFREDA TO HER UTTER ASTONISHMENT WAS MADE THE GUEST OF HONOR DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE DINNER ALBERTA WICKS MARY HAMPTON AND TWO OTHER SOPHOMORES DROPPED IN FOR ICE CREAM BY THEIR FURTIVE GLANCES AND EARNEST CONVERSATION
5375-40169-0028 IT WAS APPARENT THAT THEY STRONGLY SUSPECTED THE IDENTITY OF THE AVENGING SPECTERS ELFREDA'S PRESENCE TOO CONFIRMED THEIR SUSPICIONS IN A SPIRIT OF PURE MISCHIEF MABEL ASHE PULLED A LEAF FROM HER NOTE BOOK BORROWING A PENCIL
5375-40169-0029 SHE MADE AN INTERESTING LITTLE SKETCH OF TWO FRIGHTENED YOUNG WOMEN FLEEING BEFORE A BAND OF SHEETED SPECTERS UNDERNEATH SHE WROTE IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO LAY GHOSTS
5375-40169-0030 IT WAS PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND AND RESULTED IN FOUR YOUNG WOMEN LEAVING MARTELL'S WITHOUT FINISHING THEIR ICE CREAM YOU SPOILED THEIR TASTE FOR ICE CREAM MABEL LAUGHED FRANCES MARLTON GLANCING AT THE NOW VACANT TABLE I IMAGINE THEY ARE SHAKING IN THEIR SHOES
5375-40169-0031 THEY DID NOT THINK THAT THE JUNIORS HAD TAKEN A HAND IN THINGS REMARKED CONSTANCE FULLER HARDLY LAUGHED HELEN BURTON DID YOU SEE THEIR FACES WHEN THEY READ THAT NOTE
5375-40169-0032 HER CHARMING FACE HAD GROWN GRAVE I THINK THAT MISS WICKS AND MISS HAMPTON BOTH OUGHT TO BE SENT HOME
5375-40169-0033 I DON'T LIKE TO SAY UNKIND THINGS ABOUT AN OVERTON GIRL
5375-40169-0034 LAST NIGHT'S TRICK HOWEVER WAS COMPLETELY OVERSTEPPING THE BOUNDS IF MISS BRIGGS HAD BEEN A TIMID NERVOUS GIRL MATTERS MIGHT HAVE RESULTED QUITE DIFFERENTLY THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR DUTY TO REPORT THE MISCHIEF MAKERS
5375-40169-0035 THAT IS MY OPINION OF THE MATTER TOO AGREED GRACE
5375-40169-0036 DURING VACATION CERTAIN GIRLS WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK THINGS OVER
5375-40169-0037 I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO THINK THAT ALMOST MY LAST ACT BEFORE GOING HOME TO MY MOTHER
5375-40169-0038 IMPATIENT TO LEARN JUST WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE NIGHT BEFORE
5375-40169-0039 FINDING THEM OUT SHE MANAGED TO LEARN THE NEWS FROM THE VERY GIRL WHO HAD DECLARED HERSELF SORRY FOR HER PART IN THE ESCAPADE THIS PARTICULAR SOPHOMORE NOW THAT THE REACTION HAD SET IN WAS LOUD IN HER DENUNCIATION OF THE TRICK AND CONGRATULATED VIRGINIA
5375-40169-0040 ON NOT BEING ONE OF THOSE INTIMATELY CONCERNED IN IT BUT VIRGINIA NOW CONSCIENCE STRICKEN HAD LITTLE TO SAY SHE STILL LINGERED IN THE HALL AS THE QUARTETTE ENTERED BUT THEY PASSED HER ON THEIR WAY UPSTAIRS WITHOUT SPEAKING
5375-40169-0041 AND SHE FINALLY WENT TO HER ROOM WISHING REGRETFULLY THAT SHE HAD BEEN LESS READY TO QUARREL WITH THE GIRLS WHO BADE FAIR TO LEAD THEIR CLASS BOTH IN SCHOLARSHIP AND POPULARITY
5375-40169-0042 AFTER MAKING SURE THAT ANNE WAS OUT KNOCKED ONE AFTERNOON AT GRACE'S DOOR HOW DO YOU DO MISS GAINES SAID GRACE CIVILLY BUT WITHOUT WARMTH WON'T YOU COME IN VIRGINIA ENTERED BUT REFUSED THE CHAIR GRACE OFFERED HER
5375-40169-0043 NO THANK YOU I'LL STAND SHE REPLIED THEN IN A HALTING FASHION SHE SAID MISS HARLOWE I
5375-40169-0044 AWFULLY SORRY FOR FOR BEING SO HATEFUL ALL THIS YEAR SHE STOPPED BITING HER LIP WHICH QUIVERED SUSPICIOUSLY GRACE STARED AT HER CALLER IN AMAZEMENT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT INSOLENT VIRGINIA GAINES WAS MEEKLY APOLOGIZING TO HER
5375-40169-0045 THEN THOUGHTFUL OF THE OTHER GIRL'S FEELINGS SHE SMILED AND STRETCHED OUT HER HAND DON'T SAY ANYTHING FURTHER ABOUT IT MISS GAINES I HOPE WE SHALL BE FRIENDS
5375-40169-0046 AND COLLEGE IS THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR US TO FIND OURSELVES
5375-40169-0047 I WILL PROMISED VIRGINIA THEN IMPULSIVELY SHE CAUGHT ONE OF GRACE'S HANDS IN HERS YOU'RE THE DEAREST GIRL SHE SAID AND I'LL TRY TO BE WORTHY OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP PLEASE TELL THE GIRLS I'M SORRY I'LL TELL THEM MYSELF TO NIGHT
5375-40169-0048 WITH THAT SHE FAIRLY RAN FROM THE ROOM AND GOING TO HER OWN SHED TEARS OF REAL CONTRITION LATER IT TOOK ALL GRACE'S REASONING POWERS TO PUT ELFREDA IN A STATE OF MIND THAT VERGED EVEN SLIGHTLY ON CHARITABLE BUT AFTER MUCH COAXING
5375-40169-0049 SHE PROMISED TO BEHAVE WITH BECOMING GRACIOUSNESS TOWARD VIRGINIA OVER THE TEA AND CAKES THE CLOUDS GRADUALLY DISPERSED AND WHEN VIRGINIA WENT TO HER ROOM THAT NIGHT AFTER DECLARING THAT SHE HAD HAD A PERFECTLY LOVELY TIME GRACE TOOK FROM HER WRITING CASE
5375-40169-0050 THE NOTE THAT MIRIAM HAD FOUND AND TORE IT INTO SMALL PIECES
