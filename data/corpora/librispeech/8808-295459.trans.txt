8808-295459-0001 MEANWHILE HE WAS INTERESTING HIMSELF IN BEHALF OF YOUNG WILLIAM H HERNDON WHO AFTER SPEED'S REMOVAL TO KENTUCKY
8808-295459-0002 YOUNG MAN SEEMED TO BE MADE OF THE RIGHT KIND OF METAL WAS INDUSTRIOUS AND AGREEABLE AND MISTER LINCOLN LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN HE COULD HAVE BILLY WITH HIM IN A BUSINESS OF HIS OWN MISSUS LINCOLN WITH THAT MARVELOUS INSTINCT WHICH WOMEN OFTEN POSSESS
8808-295459-0003 OPPOSED HER HUSBAND'S TAKING BILL HERNDON INTO PARTNERSHIP
8808-295459-0004 HE WAS NEITHER BRILLIANT NOR STEADY HE CONTRACTED THE HABIT OF DRINKING THE BANE OF LINCOLN'S BUSINESS CAREER AS MISTER LINCOLN HAD NOT YET PAID OFF THE NATIONAL DEBT LARGELY DUE TO HIS FIRST BUSINESS PARTNER'S DRUNKENNESS
8808-295459-0005 IT SEEMS RATHER STRANGE THAT HE DID NOT LISTEN TO HIS WIFE'S ADMONITIONS BUT YOUNG HERNDON SEEMS ALWAYS TO HAVE EXERCISED A STRANGE FASCINATION OVER HIS OLDER FRIEND AND PARTNER WHILE YET IN PARTNERSHIP WITH JUDGE LOGAN
8808-295459-0006 MISTER LINCOLN WENT INTO THE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR MAKING SPEECHES IN ILLINOIS AND INDIANA FOR HENRY CLAY TO WHOM HE WAS THOROUGHLY DEVOTED BEFORE THIS CAMPAIGN LINCOLN HAD WRITTEN TO MISTER SPEED

8808-295459-0008 SO THAT IN GETTING BAKER THE NOMINATION I SHALL BE FIXED LIKE A FELLOW WHO IS MADE A GROOMSMAN TO A FELLOW THAT HAS CUT HIM OUT AND IS MARRYING HIS OWN DEAR GAL MISTER LINCOLN ABOUT THIS TIME WAS OFFERED THE NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS
8808-295459-0009 AND DECLINED THE HONOR MISSUS LINCOLN WHO HAD SUPREME CONFIDENCE IN HER HUSBAND'S ABILITY TRIED TO MAKE HIM MORE SELF SEEKING IN HIS POLITICAL EFFORTS HE VISITED HIS OLD HOME IN INDIANA MAKING SEVERAL SPEECHES IN THAT PART OF THE STATE
8808-295459-0010 ONE OF HIS SPEECHES WAS DELIVERED FROM THE DOOR OF A HARNESS SHOP NEAR GENTRYVILLE AND ONE HE MADE IN THE OLD CARTER SCHOOLHOUSE AFTER THIS ADDRESS HE DROVE HOME WITH MISTER JOSIAH CRAWFORD OLD BLUE NOSE
8808-295459-0011 FOR WHOM HE HAD PULLED FODDER TO PAY AN EXORBITANT PRICE FOR WEEMS'S LIFE OF WASHINGTON AND IN WHOSE HOUSE HIS SISTER AND HE HAD LIVED AS HIRED GIRL AND HIRED MAN HE DELIGHTED THE OLD FRIENDS BY ASKING ABOUT EVERYBODY AND BEING INTERESTED IN THE OLD SWIMMING HOLE
8808-295459-0012 JONES'S GROCERY WHERE HE HAD OFTEN ARGUED AND HELD FORTH THE SAW PIT THE OLD MILL THE BLACKSMITH SHOP WHOSE OWNER MISTER BALDWIN HAD TOLD HIM SOME OF HIS BEST STORIES AND WHERE HE ONCE STARTED IN TO LEARN THE BLACKSMITH'S TRADE
8808-295459-0013 HE WENT AROUND AND CALLED ON ALL HIS FORMER ACQUAINTANCES WHO WERE STILL LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HIS MEMORIES WERE SO VIVID AND HIS EMOTIONS SO KEEN THAT HE WROTE A LONG POEM ABOUT THIS
8808-295459-0014 MY CHILDHOOD'S HOME I SEE AGAIN AND SADDEN WITH THE VIEW AND STILL AS MEMORY CROWDS THE BRAIN THERE'S PLEASURE IN IT TOO AH MEMORY THOU MIDWAY WORLD TWIXT EARTH AND PARADISE
8808-295459-0015 WHERE THINGS DECAYED AND LOVED ONES LOST IN DREAMY SHADOWS RISE AND FREED FROM ALL THAT'S EARTHY VILE SEEMS HALLOWED PURE AND BRIGHT LIKE SCENES IN SOME ENCHANTED ISLE ALL BATHED IN LIQUID LIGHT
8808-295459-0016 TRYING TO SAVE BILLY FROM A BAD HABIT AS MISTER LINCOLN SPENT SO MUCH OF HIS TIME AWAY FROM SPRINGFIELD HE FELT THAT HE NEEDED A YOUNGER ASSISTANT TO KEEP OFFICE AND LOOK AFTER HIS CASES IN THE DIFFERENT COURTS
8808-295459-0017 BUT HE DID SO THOUGH THE YOUNG MAN HAD NEITHER THE ABILITY NOR EXPERIENCE TO EARN ANYTHING LIKE HALF THE INCOME OF THE OFFICE IF HERNDON HAD KEPT SOBER AND DONE HIS BEST HE MIGHT HAVE MADE SOME RETURN FOR ALL THAT MISTER LINCOLN WHO TREATED HIM LIKE A FOSTER FATHER
8808-295459-0018 WAS TRYING TO DO FOR HIM BUT BILLY DID NOTHING OF THE SORT HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIS SENIOR PARTNER'S ABSENCES BY GOING ON SPREES WITH SEVERAL DISSIPATED YOUNG MEN ABOUT TOWN WHAT LAWYER LINCOLN DID WITH A FAT FEE
8808-295459-0019 A SPRINGFIELD GENTLEMAN RELATES THE FOLLOWING STORY WHICH SHOWS LAWYER LINCOLN'S BUSINESS METHODS HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO CHARGE MUCH FOR HIS LEGAL SERVICES AND HIS GREAT LONGING TO SAVE HIS YOUNG PARTNER FROM THE CLUTCHES OF DRINK MY FATHER SAID THE NEIGHBOR
8808-295459-0020 WAS IN BUSINESS FACING THE SQUARE NOT FAR FROM THE COURT HOUSE HE HAD AN ACCOUNT WITH A MAN WHO SEEMED TO BE DOING A GOOD STRAIGHT BUSINESS FOR YEARS BUT THE FELLOW DISAPPEARED ONE NIGHT OWING FATHER ABOUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TIME WENT ON AND FATHER GOT NO TRACE OF THE VANISHED DEBTOR
8808-295459-0021 HE CONSIDERED THE ACCOUNT AS GOOD AS LOST BUT ONE DAY IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER BUSINESS HE TOLD MISTER LINCOLN HE WOULD GIVE HIM HALF OF WHAT HE COULD RECOVER OF THAT BAD DEBT THE TALL ATTORNEY'S DEEP GRAY EYES TWINKLED AS HE SAID
8808-295459-0022 ONE HALF OF NOUGHT IS NOTHING I'M NEITHER A SHARK NOR A SHYSTER MISTER MAN IF I SHOULD COLLECT IT I WOULD ACCEPT ONLY MY REGULAR PERCENTAGE BUT I MEAN IT FATHER SAID EARNESTLY I SHOULD CONSIDER IT AS GOOD AS FINDING MONEY IN THE STREET
8808-295459-0023 YES MY FATHER REPLIED THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT AND I'M GLAD IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT THE MEMBERS OF THE BAR HERE GRUMBLE BECAUSE YOU CHARGE TOO LITTLE FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND I'M WILLING TO DO MY SHARE TOWARD EDUCATING YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WELL
8808-295459-0024 SEEIN AS IT'S YOU SAID MISTER LINCOLN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE CONSIDERING THAT YOU'RE SUCH AN INTIMATE FRIEND I'D DO IT FOR TWICE AS MUCH AS I'D CHARGE A TOTAL STRANGER IS THAT SATISFACTORY I SHOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH GIVING YOU LESS THAN HALF THE GROSS AMOUNT COLLECTED IN THIS CASE
8808-295459-0025 MY FATHER INSISTED I DON'T SEE WHY YOU ARE SO LOATH TO TAKE WHAT IS YOUR DUE MISTER LINCOLN YOU HAVE A FAMILY TO SUPPORT AND WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THE FUTURE OF SEVERAL BOYS THEY NEED MONEY AND ARE AS WORTHY OF IT AS ANY OTHER MAN'S WIFE AND SONS
8808-295459-0026 MISTER LINCOLN PUT OUT HIS BIG BONY HAND AS IF TO WARD OFF A BLOW EXCLAIMING IN A PAINED TONE THAT ISN'T IT MISTER MAN THAT ISN'T IT I YIELD TO NO MAN IN LOVE TO MY WIFE AND BABIES AND I PROVIDE ENOUGH FOR THEM
8808-295459-0027 MOST OF THOSE WHO BRING THEIR CASES TO ME NEED THE MONEY MORE THAN I DO OTHER LAWYERS ROB THEM THEY ACT LIKE A PACK OF WOLVES THEY HAVE NO MERCY SO WHEN A NEEDY FELLOW COMES TO ME IN HIS TROUBLE SOMETIMES IT'S A POOR WIDOW I CAN'T TAKE MUCH FROM THEM
8808-295459-0028 I'M NOT MUCH OF A SHYLOCK I ALWAYS TRY TO GET THEM TO SETTLE IT WITHOUT GOING INTO COURT I TELL THEM IF THEY WILL MAKE IT UP AMONG THEMSELVES I WON'T CHARGE THEM ANYTHING WELL MISTER LINCOLN SAID FATHER WITH A LAUGH
8808-295459-0029 IF THEY WERE ALL LIKE YOU THERE WOULD BE NO NEED OF LAWYERS WELL EXCLAIMED LAWYER LINCOLN WITH A QUIZZICAL INFLECTION WHICH MEANT MUCH LOOK OUT FOR THE MILLENNIUM MISTER MAN STILL
8808-295459-0030 AS A GREAT FAVOR I'LL CHARGE YOU A FAT FEE IF I EVER FIND THAT FELLOW AND CAN GET ANYTHING OUT OF HIM BUT THAT'S LIKE PROMISING TO GIVE YOU HALF OF THE FIRST DOLLAR I FIND FLOATING UP THE SANGAMON ON A GRINDSTONE ISN'T IT I'LL TAKE A BIG SLICE THOUGH OUT OF THE GRINDSTONE ITSELF IF YOU SAY SO
8808-295459-0031 AND THE TALL ATTORNEY WENT OUT WITH THE PECULIAR LAUGH THAT AFTERWARD BECAME WORLD FAMOUS NOT LONG AFTERWARD WHILE IN BLOOMINGTON OUT ON THE CIRCUIT MISTER LINCOLN RAN ACROSS THE MAN WHO HAD DISAPPEARED FROM SPRINGFIELD BETWEEN TWO DAYS
8808-295459-0032 FOLLOWING THE MAN TO HIS OFFICE AND MANAGING TO TALK WITH HIM ALONE THE LAWYER BY MEANS OF THREATS MADE THE MAN GO RIGHT TO THE BANK AND DRAW OUT THE WHOLE THOUSAND THEN IT MEANT PAYMENT IN FULL OR THE PENITENTIARY THE MAN UNDERSTOOD IT AND WENT WHITE AS A SHEET
8808-295459-0033 MISTER LINCOLN HAD NO PITY ON THE FLOURISHING CRIMINAL MONEY COULD NOT PURCHASE THE FAVOR OF LINCOLN WELL I HARDLY KNOW WHICH HALF OF THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS FATHER WAS GLADDER TO GET BUT I HONESTLY BELIEVE HE WAS MORE PLEASED ON MISTER LINCOLN'S ACCOUNT THAN ON HIS OWN
8808-295459-0034 LET ME GIVE YOU YOUR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND HE SAID TO THE ATTORNEY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS ALL I'LL TAKE OUT OF THAT MISTER LINCOLN REPLIED EMPHATICALLY IT WAS NO TROUBLE AND AND I HAVEN'T EARNED EVEN THAT MUCH
8808-295459-0035 BUT MISTER LINCOLN MY FATHER DEMURRED YOU PROMISED TO TAKE HALF YES BUT YOU GOT MY WORD UNDER FALSE PRETENSES AS IT WERE
8808-295459-0036 AS HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT DAY FATHER WOULDN'T GIVE HIM ANY OF THE MONEY DUE FOR FEAR THE TOO SCRUPULOUS ATTORNEY WOULD GIVE HIM A RECEIPT IN FULL FOR COLLECTING FINALLY
8808-295459-0037 MISTER LINCOLN WENT AWAY AFTER YIELDING ENOUGH TO SAY HE MIGHT ACCEPT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SOMETIME IN A PINCH OF SOME SORT THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG DELAYED BUT IT WAS NOT BECAUSE OF ILLNESS OR ANY SPECIAL NECESSITY IN HIS OWN FAMILY HIS YOUNG PARTNER BILLY HERNDON
8808-295459-0038 HAD BEEN CAROUSING WITH SEVERAL OF HIS CRONIES IN A SALOON AROUND ON FOURTH STREET AND THE GANG HAD BROKEN MIRRORS DECANTERS AND OTHER THINGS IN THEIR DRUNKEN SPREE THE PROPRIETOR TIRED OF SUCH WORK HAD HAD THEM ALL ARRESTED
8808-295459-0039 MISTER LINCOLN ALWAYS ALARMED WHEN BILLY FAILED TO APPEAR AT THE USUAL HOUR IN THE MORNING WENT IN SEARCH OF HIM AND FOUND HIM AND HIS PARTNERS IN DISTRESS LOCKED UP IN THE CALABOOSE THE OTHERS WERE HELPLESS UNABLE TO PAY OR TO PROMISE TO PAY FOR ANY OF THE DAMAGES
8808-295459-0040 SO IT DEVOLVED ON MISTER LINCOLN TO RAISE THE WHOLE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS THE ANGRY SALOON KEEPER DEMANDED HE CAME INTO OUR OFFICE OUT OF BREATH AND SAID SHEEPISHLY I RECKON I CAN USE THAT TWO FIFTY NOW CHECK OR CURRENCY ASKED FATHER
8808-295459-0041 CURRENCY IF YOU'VE GOT IT HANDY GIVE MISTER LINCOLN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FATHER CALLED TO A CLERK IN THE OFFICE THERE WAS A MOMENT'S PAUSE DURING WHICH MY FATHER REFRAINED FROM ASKING ANY QUESTIONS
8808-295459-0042 AND MISTER LINCOLN WAS IN NO MOOD TO GIVE INFORMATION AS SOON AS THE MONEY WAS BROUGHT THE TALL ATTORNEY SEIZED THE BILLS AND STALKED OUT WITHOUT COUNTING IT OR SAYING ANYTHING BUT THANKEE MISTER MAN AND HURRIED DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE SQUARE TOWARD THE COURT HOUSE
8808-295459-0043 CLUTCHING THE PRECIOUS BANKNOTES IN HIS BONY TALONS FATHER SAW HIM CROSS THE STREET SO FAST THAT THE TAILS OF HIS LONG COAT STOOD OUT STRAIGHT BEHIND THEN GO UP THE COURT HOUSE STEPS TWO AT A TIME AND DISAPPEAR WE LEARNED AFTERWARD WHAT HE DID WITH THE MONEY
8808-295459-0044 OF COURSE BILL HERNDON WAS PENITENT AND PROMISED TO MEND HIS WAYS AND OF COURSE MISTER LINCOLN BELIEVED HIM HE TOOK THE MONEY VERY MUCH AGAINST HIS WILL EVEN AGAINST HIS PRINCIPLES THINKING IT MIGHT SAVE HIS JUNIOR PARTNER FROM THE DRUNKARD'S GRAVE
