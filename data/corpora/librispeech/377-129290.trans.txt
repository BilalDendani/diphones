377-129290-0003 RIGHTLY CONCEIVING IT HIGHLY EXPEDIENT TO ATTRACT THE NOTICE AND ROUSE THE INDIGNATION OF THE GENTLEMAN AFORESAID THE GENTLEMAN'S NOTICE WAS VERY SOON ATTRACTED FOR HE HAD NOT WALKED THREE PACES WHEN HE TURNED ANGRILY ROUND
377-129290-0004 AND INQUIRED WHAT THAT YOUNG CUR WAS HOWLING FOR AND WHY MISTER BUMBLE DID NOT FAVOUR HIM WITH SOMETHING WHICH WOULD RENDER THE SERIES OF VOCULAR EXCLAMATIONS SO DESIGNATED AN INVOLUNTARY PROCESS

377-129290-0012 HERE THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS HAD NOT AT ALL IMPROVED SOWERBERRY HAD NOT YET RETURNED AND OLIVER CONTINUED TO KICK
377-129290-0013 AT THE CELLAR DOOR THE ACCOUNTS OF HIS FEROCITY AS RELATED BY MISSUS SOWERBERRY AND CHARLOTTE WERE OF SO STARTLING A NATURE
377-129290-0014 EXCLAIMED MISSUS SOWERBERRY MEAT MA'AM MEAT

377-129290-0018 WHEN THE LADY BROUGHT HER EYES DOWN TO EARTH AGAIN
377-129290-0019 ALL THROUGH THE APPRENTICESHIP
377-129290-0020 EXCITABLE NATURES MISSUS SOWERBERRY
377-129290-0021 AT THIS POINT OF MISTER BUMBLE'S DISCOURSE OLIVER JUST HEARING ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SOME ALLUSION WAS BEING MADE TO HIS MOTHER RECOMMENCED KICKING WITH A VIOLENCE THAT RENDERED EVERY OTHER SOUND INAUDIBLE SOWERBERRY RETURNED AT THIS JUNCTURE
377-129290-0022 OLIVER'S OFFENCE HAVING BEEN EXPLAINED TO HIM WITH SUCH EXAGGERATIONS AS THE LADIES THOUGHT BEST CALCULATED TO ROUSE HIS IRE HE UNLOCKED THE CELLAR DOOR IN A TWINKLING AND DRAGGED HIS REBELLIOUS APPRENTICE OUT BY THE COLLAR
377-129290-0023 OLIVER'S CLOTHES HAD BEEN TORN IN THE BEATING HE HAD RECEIVED HIS FACE WAS BRUISED AND SCRATCHED AND HIS HAIR SCATTERED OVER HIS FOREHEAD THE ANGRY FLUSH HAD NOT DISAPPEARED HOWEVER
377-129290-0024 AND WHEN HE WAS PULLED OUT OF HIS PRISON HE SCOWLED BOLDLY ON NOAH AND LOOKED QUITE UNDISMAYED
377-129290-0025 GIVING OLIVER A SHAKE AND A BOX ON THE EAR HE CALLED MY MOTHER NAMES
377-129290-0026 SHE DESERVED WHAT HE SAID AND WORSE SHE DIDN'T SAID OLIVER SHE DID SAID MISSUS SOWERBERRY IT'S A LIE SAID OLIVER MISSUS SOWERBERRY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
377-129290-0027 THIS FLOOD OF TEARS LEFT MISTER SOWERBERRY NO ALTERNATIVE IF HE HAD HESITATED FOR ONE INSTANT TO PUNISH OLIVER MOST SEVERELY IT MUST BE QUITE CLEAR TO EVERY EXPERIENCED READER THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
377-129290-0028 ACCORDING TO ALL PRECEDENTS IN DISPUTES OF MATRIMONY ESTABLISHED A BRUTE AN UNNATURAL HUSBAND AN INSULTING CREATURE A BASE IMITATION OF A MAN AND VARIOUS OTHER AGREEABLE CHARACTERS TOO NUMEROUS FOR RECITAL
377-129290-0029 WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS CHAPTER TO DO HIM JUSTICE HE WAS AS FAR AS HIS POWER WENT IT WAS NOT VERY EXTENSIVE KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS THE BOY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT WAS HIS INTEREST TO BE SO
377-129290-0030 PERHAPS BECAUSE HIS WIFE DISLIKED HIM THE FLOOD OF TEARS HOWEVER LEFT HIM NO RESOURCE SO HE AT ONCE GAVE HIM A DRUBBING WHICH SATISFIED EVEN MISSUS SOWERBERRY HERSELF
377-129290-0031 AND RENDERED MISTER BUMBLE'S SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION OF THE PAROCHIAL CANE RATHER UNNECESSARY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY HE WAS SHUT UP IN THE BACK KITCHEN IN COMPANY WITH A PUMP AND A SLICE OF BREAD
377-129290-0032 AND AT NIGHT MISSUS SOWERBERRY AFTER MAKING VARIOUS REMARKS OUTSIDE THE DOOR BY NO MEANS COMPLIMENTARY TO THE MEMORY OF HIS MOTHER
377-129290-0033 ORDERED HIM UPSTAIRS TO HIS DISMAL BED IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SILENCE AND STILLNESS OF THE GLOOMY WORKSHOP OF THE UNDERTAKER THAT OLIVER GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS WHICH THE DAY'S TREATMENT
377-129290-0034 HE HAD LISTENED TO THEIR TAUNTS WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT HE HAD BORNE THE LASH WITHOUT A CRY FOR HE FELT THAT PRIDE SWELLING IN HIS HEART WHICH WOULD HAVE KEPT DOWN A SHRIEK TO THE LAST
377-129290-0035 THOUGH THEY HAD ROASTED HIM ALIVE BUT NOW WHEN THERE WERE NONE TO SEE OR HEAR HIM HE FELL UPON HIS KNEES ON THE FLOOR AND HIDING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS WEPT SUCH TEARS
377-129290-0036 AS GOD SEND FOR THE CREDIT OF OUR NATURE FEW SO YOUNG MAY EVER HAVE CAUSE TO POUR OUT BEFORE HIM FOR A LONG TIME OLIVER REMAINED MOTIONLESS IN THIS ATTITUDE THE CANDLE WAS BURNING LOW IN THE SOCKET
377-129290-0037 WHEN HE ROSE TO HIS FEET HAVING GAZED CAUTIOUSLY ROUND HIM AND LISTENED INTENTLY HE GENTLY UNDID THE FASTENINGS OF THE DOOR AND LOOKED ABROAD IT WAS A COLD DARK NIGHT
377-129290-0038 THE STARS SEEMED TO THE BOY'S EYES FARTHER FROM THE EARTH THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN THEM BEFORE THERE WAS NO WIND AND THE SOMBRE SHADOWS THROWN BY THE TREES UPON THE GROUND
377-129290-0039 FROM BEING SO STILL HE SOFTLY RECLOSED THE DOOR HAVING AVAILED HIMSELF OF THE EXPIRING LIGHT OF THE CANDLE TO TIE UP IN A HANDKERCHIEF THE FEW ARTICLES OF WEARING APPAREL HE HAD
377-129290-0040 SAT HIMSELF DOWN UPON A BENCH TO WAIT FOR MORNING WITH THE FIRST RAY OF LIGHT THAT STRUGGLED THROUGH THE CREVICES IN THE SHUTTERS OLIVER AROSE AND AGAIN UNBARRED THE DOOR ONE TIMID LOOK AROUND
377-129290-0041 ONE MOMENT'S PAUSE OF HESITATION HE HAD CLOSED IT BEHIND HIM AND WAS IN THE OPEN STREET HE LOOKED TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT UNCERTAIN WHITHER TO FLY HE REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN THE WAGGONS AS THEY WENT OUT
377-129290-0042 TOILING UP THE HILL HE TOOK THE SAME ROUTE AND ARRIVING AT A FOOTPATH ACROSS THE FIELDS WHICH HE KNEW AFTER SOME DISTANCE LED OUT AGAIN INTO THE ROAD STRUCK INTO IT AND WALKED QUICKLY ON
377-129290-0043 ALONG THIS SAME FOOTPATH OLIVER WELL REMEMBERED HE HAD TROTTED BESIDE MISTER BUMBLE WHEN HE FIRST CARRIED HIM TO THE WORKHOUSE FROM THE FARM HIS WAY LAY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE COTTAGE HIS HEART BEAT QUICKLY WHEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF THIS
377-129290-0044 HE HAD COME A LONG WAY THOUGH AND SHOULD LOSE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME BY DOING SO BESIDES IT WAS SO EARLY THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FEAR OF HIS BEING SEEN SO HE WALKED ON HE REACHED THE HOUSE
377-129290-0045 THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF ITS INMATES STIRRING AT THAT EARLY HOUR OLIVER STOPPED AND PEEPED INTO THE GARDEN A CHILD WAS WEEDING ONE OF THE LITTLE BEDS AS HE STOPPED HE RAISED HIS PALE FACE
377-129290-0046 AND DISCLOSED THE FEATURES OF ONE OF HIS FORMER COMPANIONS OLIVER FELT GLAD TO SEE HIM BEFORE HE WENT FOR THOUGH YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF HE HAD BEEN HIS LITTLE FRIEND AND PLAYMATE THEY HAD BEEN BEATEN AND STARVED AND SHUT UP TOGETHER MANY AND MANY A TIME
