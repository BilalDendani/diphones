6014-32856-0000 AND ITS SWAYING AND JERKING WERE PLEASANT AND LIFE LIKE I FANCY I WAS IN ONE OF THOSE MOODS WHICH UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES I SOMETIMES EXPERIENCE STILL A SEMI NARCOTIC EXCITEMENT SILENT BUT DELIGHTFUL
6014-32856-0001 AN UNDULATING LANDSCAPE WITH A HOMELY FARMSTEAD HERE AND THERE AND PLENTY OF OLD ENGLISH TIMBER SCATTERED GRANDLY OVER IT EXTENDED MISTILY TO MY RIGHT ON THE LEFT THE ROAD IS OVERTOPPED BY MASSES OF NOBLE FOREST
6014-32856-0002 THE OLD PARK OF BRANDON LIES THERE MORE THAN FOUR MILES FROM END TO END THESE MASSES OF SOLEMN AND DISCOLOURED VERDURE THE FAINT BUT SPLENDID LIGHTS AND LONG FILMY SHADOWS THE SLOPES AND HOLLOWS
6014-32856-0003 MY EYES WANDERED OVER THEM ALL WITH THAT STRANGE SENSE OF UNREALITY AND THAT MINGLING OF SWEET AND BITTER FANCY WITH WHICH WE REVISIT A SCENE FAMILIAR IN VERY REMOTE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD AND WHICH HAS HAUNTED A LONG INTERVAL OF MATURITY AND ABSENCE
6014-32856-0004 LIKE A ROMANTIC REVERIE AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE CHAISE WINDOWS EVERY MOMENT PRESENTED SOME GROUP OR OUTLINE OR HOMELY OBJECT FOR YEARS FORGOTTEN AND NOW WITH A STRANGE SURPRISE HOW VIVIDLY REMEMBERED AND HOW AFFECTIONATELY GREETED
6014-32856-0005 STILL STOOD IN MEMORY AT THE DOOR IN HIS BLACK SHORTS AND GAITERS WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND A PUCKERED SMILE ON HIS HARD RUDDY COUNTENANCE AS I APPROACHED HE SMILED LITTLE ON OTHERS I BELIEVE
6014-32856-0006 BUT ALWAYS KINDLY UPON ME THIS GENERAL LIKING FOR CHILDREN AND INSTINCT OF SMILING ON THEM IS ONE SOURCE OF THE DELIGHTFUL ILLUSIONS WHICH MAKE THE REMEMBRANCE OF EARLY DAYS SO LIKE A DREAM OF PARADISE AND GIVE US AT STARTING SUCH FALSE NOTIONS OF OUR VALUE
6014-32856-0007 THERE WAS A LITTLE FAIR HAIRED CHILD PLAYING ON THE GROUND BEFORE THE STEPS AS I WHIRLED BY THE OLD RECTOR HAD LONG PASSED AWAY THE SHORTS GAITERS AND SMILE A PHANTOM AND NATURE WHO HAD GATHERED IN THE PAST WAS PROVIDING FOR THE FUTURE
6014-32856-0008 UP CHURCH STREET I CONTRIVED A PEEP AT THE OLD GRAY TOWER WHERE THE CHIMES HUNG AND AS WE TURNED THE CORNER A GLANCE AT THE BRANDON ARMS HOW VERY SMALL AND LOW THAT PALATIAL HOSTELRY OF MY EARLIER RECOLLECTIONS HAD GROWN THERE WERE NEW FACES AT THE DOOR
6014-32856-0009 AND AS I WRITE I OPEN MY EYES AND START AND CRY CAN IT BE TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY AYE BY JOVE FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS SINCE THEN HOW MY DAYS HAVE FLOWN AND I THINK WHEN ANOTHER SUCH YESTERDAY SHALL HAVE ARRIVED WHERE SHALL I BE
6014-32856-0010 IT IS THE FIRST TEN THAT EMERGE FROM NOTHING AND COMMENCING IN A POINT IT IS DURING THEM THAT CONSCIOUSNESS MEMORY ALL THE FACULTIES GROW AND THE EXPERIENCE OF SENSE IS SO NOVEL CROWDED AND ASTOUNDING
6014-32856-0011 BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON MY JOURNEY WAS FROM LONDON WHEN I HAD REACHED MY LODGINGS AFTER MY LITTLE EXCURSION UP THE RHINE UPON MY TABLE THERE LAY AMONG THE REST ONE LETTER
6014-32856-0012 I COULD NOT IN THE LEAST TELL WHY IT WAS A BROAD FACED LETTER OF BLUISH COMPLEXION AND HAD MADE INQUISITION AFTER ME IN THE COUNTRY HAD ASKED FOR ME AT QUEEN'S FOLKSTONE AND VISED BY MY COUSIN HAD PRESENTED ITSELF AT THE FRIARS IN SHROPSHIRE
6014-32856-0013 THE SCARS AND FURROWS OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND ADVENTURE IT HAD NOT A GOOD COUNTENANCE SOMEHOW THE ORIGINAL LINES WERE NOT PREPOSSESSING THE HANDWRITING I KNEW AS ONE SOMETIMES KNOWS A FACE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO REMEMBER WHO THE PLAGUE IT BELONGS TO
6014-32856-0014 BUT STILL WITH AN UNPLEASANT ASSOCIATION ABOUT IT I EXAMINED IT CAREFULLY AND LAID IT DOWN UNOPENED I WENT THROUGH HALF A DOZEN OTHERS AND RECURRED TO IT AND PUZZLED OVER ITS EXTERIOR AGAIN AND AGAIN POSTPONED WHAT I FANCIED WOULD PROVE A DISAGREEABLE DISCOVERY AND THIS HAPPENED EVERY NOW AND AGAIN
6014-32856-0015 I EXCLAIMED A GOOD DEAL RELIEVED MARK WYLDER YES MASTER MARK COULD NOT HURT ME THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT HIM TO EXCITE THE LEAST UNEASINESS ON THE CONTRARY I BELIEVE HE LIKED ME AS WELL AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF LIKING ANYBODY AND IT WAS NOW SEVEN YEARS SINCE WE HAD MET
6014-32856-0016 WHERE FOR MANY DAYS I GROPED AND STUMBLED LOOKING FOR LIGHT AND WAS IN A MANNER LOST HEARING STRANGE SOUNDS WITNESSING IMPERFECTLY STRANGE SIGHTS AND AT LAST ARRIVING AT A DREADFUL CHAMBER A SAD SORT OF SUPERSTITION STEALS OVER ME
6014-32856-0017 I HAD THEN BEEN HIS WORKING JUNIOR IN THE CAUSE OF WYLDER VERSUS TRUSTEES OF BRANDON MINOR DORCAS BRANDON HIS OWN COUSIN THERE WAS A COMPLICATED COUSINSHIP AMONG THESE BRANDONS WYLDERS AND LAKES
6014-32856-0018 INEXTRICABLE INTERMARRIAGES WHICH FIVE YEARS AGO BEFORE I RENOUNCED THE BAR I HAD AT MY FINGERS ENDS BUT WHICH HAD NOW RELAPSED INTO HAZE
6014-32856-0019 A SPICE OF THE INSANE AND THE DIABOLICAL THEY WERE AN ILL CONDITIONED RACE THAT IS TO SAY
6014-32856-0020 EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE EMERGED A MISCREANT WITH A PRETTY EVIDENT VEIN OF MADNESS THERE WAS SIR JONATHAN BRANDON FOR INSTANCE WHO RAN HIS OWN NEPHEW THROUGH THE LUNGS IN A DUEL FOUGHT IN A PAROXYSM OF CENCIAN JEALOUSY
6014-32856-0021 AND AFTERWARDS SHOT HIS COACHMAN DEAD UPON THE BOX THROUGH HIS COACH WINDOW AND FINALLY DIED IN VIENNA WHITHER HE HAD ABSCONDED OF A PIKE THRUST RECEIVED FROM A SENTRY IN A BRAWL THE WYLDERS HAD NOT MUCH TO BOAST OF EVEN IN CONTRAST WITH THAT WICKED LINE
6014-32856-0022 THEY HAD PRODUCED THEIR MADMEN AND VILLAINS TOO AND THERE HAD BEEN FREQUENT INTERMARRIAGES NOT VERY OFTEN HAPPY
6014-32856-0023 AND EVEN WORSE DOINGS THE WYLDERS OF BRANDON APPEAR VERY EARLY IN HISTORY AND THE WYLDER ARMS WITH THEIR LEGEND RESURGAM STANDS IN BOLD RELIEF OVER THE GREAT DOOR OF BRANDON HALL SO THERE WERE WYLDERS OF BRANDON AND BRANDONS OF BRANDON
6014-32856-0024 IN ONE GENERATION A WYLDER ILL USING HIS WIFE AND HATING HIS CHILDREN WOULD CUT THEM ALL OFF AND SEND THE ESTATE BOUNDING BACK AGAIN TO THE BRANDONS
6014-32856-0025 UNTIL THE OLD BRANDON TYPE REAPPEARED
6014-32856-0026 THE ESTATES WERE BACK AGAIN WITH THE WYLDERS A STATEMENT OF TITLE IS USUALLY A DRY AFFAIR BUT THAT OF THE DYNASTY OF BRANDON HALL WAS A TRUCULENT ROMANCE THEIR VERY WILLS WERE SPICED WITH THE DEVILMENT OF THE TESTATORS AND ABOUNDED IN INSINUATIONS AND EVEN LANGUAGE WHICH WERE SCANDALOUS
6014-32856-0027 AND COMMITTED WASTE BESIDE IN TIMBER HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IN LIFE AS I AM TOLD BUT THAT DON'T SIGNIFY MUCH ONLY THE HOUSE WILL COST ME A PRETTY PENNY TO GET IT INTO ORDER AND FURNISH THE RENTAL IS FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR AND SOME HUNDREDS AND THE RENTS CAN BE GOT UP A BIT SO LARKIN TELLS ME
6014-32856-0028 I'M GROWN BROWN AND GREAT WHISKERS I MET POOR DOMINICK WHAT AN ASS THAT CHAP IS BUT HE DID NOT KNOW ME TILL I INTRODUCED MYSELF SO I MUST BE A GOOD DEAL CHANGED OUR SHIP WAS AT MALTA WHEN I GOT THE LETTER I WAS SICK OF THE SERVICE AND NO WONDER A LIEUTENANT
6014-32856-0029 AND THERE LIKELY TO STICK ALL MY DAYS SIX MONTHS LAST YEAR ON THE AFRICAN COAST WATCHING SLAVERS THINK OF THAT
6014-32856-0030 ADVICE AND THAT SORT OF THING I DO NOT THINK HE IS A YEAR OLDER THAN I BUT TAKES AIRS BECAUSE HE'S A TRUSTEE BUT I ONLY LAUGH AT TRIFLES THAT WOULD HAVE RILED ME ONCE
6014-32856-0031 AND DREW IT UNCOMMON MILD AND HE HAS BEEN USEFUL TO ME AND I THINK MATTERS ARE PRETTY WELL ARRANGED TO DISAPPOINT THE KIND INTENTION OF GOOD UNCLE WYLDER THE BRUTE HE HATED MY FATHER BUT THAT WAS NO REASON TO PERSECUTE ME AND I BUT AN INFANT ALMOST WHEN HE DIED
6014-32856-0032 WELL YOU KNOW HE LEFT BRANDON WITH SOME CHARGES TO MY COUSIN DORCAS SHE IS A SUPERBLY FINE GIRL OUR SHIP WAS AT NAPLES WHEN SHE WAS THERE TWO YEARS AGO AND I SAW A GOOD DEAL OF HER OF COURSE IT WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF THEN
6014-32856-0033 YOU SEE THE OLD BRUTE MEANT TO LEAVE HER A LIFE ESTATE BUT IT DOES NOT AMOUNT TO THAT THOUGH IT WON'T BENEFIT ME FOR HE SETTLED THAT WHEN I DIE IT SHALL GO TO HIS RIGHT HEIRS THAT WILL BE TO MY SON IF I EVER HAVE ONE SO MISS DORCAS MUST PACK AND TURN OUT WHENEVER I DIE
6014-32856-0034 THAT IS IF I SLIP MY CABLE FIRST LARKIN TOLD ME THIS AND I TOOK AN OPINION AND FOUND IT IS SO
6014-32856-0035 AS WELL AS ME WOULD BE WE SHOULD MARRY SHE IS A WIDE AWAKE YOUNG LADY AND NOTHING THE WORSE FOR THAT I'M A BIT THAT WAY MYSELF AND SO VERY LITTLE COURTSHIP HAS SUFFICED SHE IS A SPLENDID BEAUTY AND WHEN YOU SEE HER YOU'LL SAY ANY FELLOW MIGHT BE PROUD OF SUCH A BRIDE
6014-32856-0036 AND SO I AM AND NOW DEAR CHARLIE YOU HAVE IT ALL IT WILL TAKE PLACE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE TWENTY FOURTH OF NEXT MONTH AND YOU MUST COME DOWN BY THE FIRST IF YOU CAN DON'T DISAPPOINT I WANT YOU FOR BEST MAN MAYBE
6014-32856-0037 AND BESIDES I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME THINGS THEY WANT ME TO DO IN THE SETTLEMENTS AND YOU WERE ALWAYS A LONG HEADED FELLOW SO PRAY DON'T REFUSE DEAR CHARLIE EVER MOST SINCERELY YOUR OLD FRIEND
6014-32856-0038 UNTIL AFTER THE MARRIAGE AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A ROOM AT THE HALL AND CAPITAL SHOOTING WHEN WE RETURN
6014-32856-0039 I CAN'T SAY THAT WYLDER WAS AN OLD FRIEND BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES I HAD WE HAD BEEN FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS AT SCHOOL TOGETHER AND WHEN HIS SHIP CAME TO ENGLAND MET FREQUENTLY
6014-32856-0040 AND TWICE WHEN HE WAS ON LEAVE WE HAD BEEN FOR MONTHS TOGETHER UNDER THE SAME ROOF AND HAD FOR SOME YEARS KEPT UP A REGULAR CORRESPONDENCE WHICH FIRST GREW DESULTORY AND FINALLY AS MANHOOD SUPERVENED DIED OUT THE PLAIN TRUTH IS I DID NOT VERY MUCH LIKE HIM
6014-32856-0041 THEN THERE WAS THAT BEAUTIFUL APATHETIC DORCAS BRANDON WHERE IS THE LAGGARD SO DULL AS TO EXPERIENCE NO PLEASING FLUTTER AT HIS HEART IN ANTICIPATION OF MEETING A PERFECT BEAUTY IN A COUNTRY HOUSE
6014-32856-0042 I WAS ROMANTIC LIKE EVERY OTHER YOUNGISH FELLOW WHO IS NOT A PREMATURE CURMUDGEON
6014-32856-0043 THE YOUNG LADY STILL WAS FANCY FREE NOT A BIT IN LOVE
