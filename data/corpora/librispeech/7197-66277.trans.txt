7197-66277-0014 THEN GO THY WAYS BUT THE LAD LINGERED AND HE REDDENED AND LOOKED ON THE GROUND AND THEN HE SAID MY FATHER
7197-66277-0015 AND I CAME NEAR TO THEM AND NOTED WHAT THEY WERE DOING
7197-66277-0016 NOW THEN DO WHAT THOU WILT THEREWITH HE TURNED ABOUT AND WENT HIS WAY AT ONCE RUNNING LIKE A COLT WHICH HAS NEVER FELT HALTER OR BIT
7197-66277-0017 BUT OTTER RODE BACK HASTILY AND ROUSED CERTAIN MEN IN WHOM HE TRUSTED AND BID THEM ROUSE THE CAPTAINS AND ALL THE HOST AND BID MEN GET TO HORSE SPEEDILY
7197-66277-0018 AND WITH AS LITTLE NOISE AS MIGHT BE SO DID THEY AND THERE WAS LITTLE DELAY FOR MEN WERE SLEEPING WITH ONE EYE OPEN AS FOLK SAY AND MANY WERE ALREADY ASTIR
7197-66277-0019 SO IN A LITTLE WHILE THEY WERE ALL IN THE SADDLE AND THE MIST YET STRETCHED LOW OVER THE MEADOW FOR THE MORNING WAS COOL AND WITHOUT WIND
7197-66277-0020 THEN OTTER BADE THE WORD BE CARRIED DOWN THE RANKS THAT THEY SHOULD RIDE AS QUIETLY AS MAY BE AND FARE THROUGH THE MIST TO DO THE ROMANS SOME HURT
7197-66277-0021 AND ALL MEN TO HEED WELL THE SIGNAL OF TURNING AND DRAWING ABACK AND THEREWITH THEY RODE OFF DOWN THE MEADOW LED BY MEN WHO COULD HAVE LED THEM THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT
7197-66277-0022 BUT FOR THE ROMANS THEY WERE INDEED GETTING READY TO CROSS THE FORD WHEN THE MIST SHOULD HAVE RISEN AND ON THE BANK IT WAS THINNING ALREADY AND MELTING AWAY
7197-66277-0023 AND THE SUNRISE WHICH WAS JUST AT HAND AND THE BANK MOREOVER WAS STONIER AND HIGHER THAN THE MEADOW'S FACE WHICH FELL AWAY FROM IT AS A SHALLOW DISH FROM ITS RIM THEREON YET LAY THE MIST
7197-66277-0024 LIKE A WHITE WALL SO THE ROMANS AND THEIR FRIENDS THE DASTARDS OF THE GOTHS HAD WELL NIGH GOT ALL READY AND HAD DRIVEN STAKES INTO THE WATER FROM BANK TO BANK TO MARK OUT THE SAFE FORD
7197-66277-0025 AND MOST OF THEIR GOTHS WERE BY NOW IN THE WATER OR UP ON THE WOLFING MEADOW
7197-66277-0026 AND THE REST OF THE HOST WAS DRAWN UP IN GOOD ORDER BAND BY BAND
7197-66277-0027 OF A SUDDEN ONE OF THE DASTARDS OF THE GOTHS WHO WAS CLOSE TO THE CAPTAIN CRIED OUT THAT HE HEARD HORSE COMING BUT BECAUSE HE SPAKE IN THE GOTHIC TONGUE FEW HEEDED BUT EVEN THEREWITH
7197-66277-0028 AN OLD LEADER OF A HUNDRED CRIED OUT THE SAME TIDINGS IN THE ROMAN TONGUE AND ALL MEN FELL TO HANDLING THEIR WEAPONS BUT BEFORE THEY COULD FACE DULY TOWARD THE MEADOW
7197-66277-0029 AND THEREWITHAL BURST FORTH THE SOUND OF THE MARKMEN'S WAR HORN LIKE THE ROARING OF A HUNDRED BULLS MINGLED WITH THE THUNDER OF HORSES AT THE GALLOP
7197-66277-0030 AND THEN DARK OVER THE WALL OF MIST SHOWED THE CRESTS OF THE RIDERS OF THE MARK THOUGH SCARCE WERE THEIR HORSES SEEN TILL THEIR WHOLE WAR RANK CAME DARK AND GLITTERING
7197-66277-0031 INTO THE SPACE OF THE RISING GROUND WHERE THE MIST WAS BUT A HAZE NOW AND NOW AT LAST SMITTEN ATHWART BY THE LOW SUN JUST ARISEN THEREWITH CAME ANOTHER STORM OF SHAFTS
7197-66277-0032 WHEREIN JAVELINS AND SPEARS CAST BY THE HAND WERE MINGLED WITH THE ARROWS BUT THE ROMAN RANKS HAD FACED THE MEADOW AND THE STORM WHICH IT YIELDED SWIFTLY AND STEADILY
7197-66277-0033 BECAUSE OF THEIR HASTE SO THAT FEW WERE SLAIN BY THEM AND THE ROMAN CAPTAIN STILL LOTH TO FIGHT WITH THE GOTHS IN EARNEST FOR NO REWARD
7197-66277-0034 AND STILL MORE AND MORE BELIEVING THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY BAND OF THEM THAT HE HAD TO LOOK TO BADE THOSE WHO WERE NIGHEST THE FORD NOT TO TARRY FOR THE ONSET OF A FEW WILD RIDERS
7197-66277-0035 BUT TO GO THEIR WAYS INTO THE WATER ELSE BY A SUDDEN ONRUSH MIGHT THE ROMANS HAVE ENTANGLED OTTER'S BAND IN THEIR RANKS AND SO DESTROYED ALL AS IT WAS
7197-66277-0036 THE HORSEMEN FELL NOT ON THE ROMAN RANKS FULL IN FACE BUT PASSING LIKE A STORM ATHWART THE RANKS TO THE RIGHT FELL ON THERE WHERE THEY WERE IN THINNEST ARRAY FOR THEY WERE GATHERED TO THE FORD AS AFORESAID
7197-66277-0037 AND SLEW SOME AND DRAVE SOME INTO THE DEEPS AND TROUBLED THE WHOLE ROMAN HOST SO NOW THE ROMAN CAPTAIN WAS FORCED TO TAKE NEW ORDER AND GATHER ALL HIS MEN TOGETHER AND ARRAY HIS MEN FOR A HARD FIGHT
7197-66277-0038 AND THE SUN WAS BRIGHT AND HOT HIS MEN SERRIED THEIR RANKS AND THE FRONT RANK CAST THEIR SPEARS
7197-66277-0039 AND SLEW BOTH MEN AND HORSES OF THE GOTHS AS THOSE RODE ALONG THEIR FRONT CASTING THEIR JAVELINS AND SHOOTING HERE AND THERE FROM BEHIND THEIR HORSES IF OCCASION SERVED OR MAKING A SHIFT TO SEND AN ARROW EVEN AS THEY SAT A HORSEBACK
7197-66277-0040 AND ALL THE MASS OF THEM FLOWED FORWARD TOGETHER LOOKING AS IF IT MIGHT NEVER BE BROKEN BUT OTTER WOULD NOT ABIDE THE SHOCK SINCE HE HAD LOST MEN AND HORSES
7197-66277-0041 AND HAD NO MIND TO BE CAUGHT IN THE SWEEP OF THEIR NET SO HE MADE THE SIGN AND HIS COMPANY DREW OFF TO RIGHT AND LEFT YET KEEPING WITHIN BOWSHOT SO THAT THE BOWMEN STILL LOOSED AT THE ROMANS
7197-66277-0042 BUT THEY FOR THEIR PART MIGHT NOT FOLLOW AFOOT MEN ON UNTIRED HORSES AND THEIR OWN HORSE WAS ON THE WEST SIDE WITH THE BAGGAGE
7197-66277-0043 AS THE ROMAN CAPTAIN KNEW SO THEY STOOD AWHILE MAKING GRIM COUNTENANCE AND THEN SLOWLY DREW BACK
7197-66277-0044 WHO SHOT AT THE GOTHS AS THEY RODE FORWARD BUT ABODE NOT THEIR SHOCK BUT OTTER AND HIS FOLK FOLLOWED AFTER THE ROMANS AGAIN AND AGAIN DID THEM SOME HURT
7197-66277-0045 AND AT LAST DREW SO NIGH THAT ONCE MORE THE ROMANS STORMED FORTH AND ONCE MORE SMOTE A STROKE IN THE AIR NOR EVEN SO WOULD THE MARKMEN CEASE TO MEDDLE WITH THEM
7197-66277-0046 THOUGH NEVER WOULD OTTER SUFFER HIS MEN TO BE MINGLED WITH THEM AT THE LAST THE ROMANS SEEING THAT OTTER WOULD NOT WALK INTO THE OPEN TRAP AND GROWING WEARY OF THIS BICKERING BEGAN TO TAKE THE WATER LITTLE BY LITTLE
7197-66277-0047 WHILE A STRONG COMPANY KEPT FACE TO THE MARKMEN AND NOW OTTER SAW THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE HINDERED ANY LONGER AND HE HAD LOST MANY MEN AND EVEN NOW FEARED LEST HE SHOULD BE CAUGHT IN THE TRAP
7197-66277-0048 AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS HIGH NOON BY NOW
7197-66277-0049 SO THAT THEY MIGHT GET THEM INTO THE WOOD SO HE DREW OUT OF BOWSHOT AND BADE HIS MEN BREATHE THEIR HORSES AND REST THEMSELVES AND EAT SOMETHING AND THEY DID SO GLADLY
7197-66277-0050 SINCE THEY SAW THAT THEY MIGHT NOT FALL UPON THE ROMANS TO LIVE AND DIE FOR IT UNTIL THIODOLF WAS COME OR UNTIL THEY KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT COMING
7197-66277-0051 BUT THE ROMANS CROSSED THE FORD IN GOOD EARNEST AND WERE SOON ALL GATHERED TOGETHER ON THE WESTERN BANK MAKING THEM READY FOR THE MARCH TO WOLFSTEAD AND IT MUST BE TOLD THAT THE ROMAN CAPTAIN
7197-66277-0052 WAS THE MORE DELIBERATE ABOUT THIS
7197-66277-0053 THERE THE MORNING BEFORE HE THOUGHT THAT THE ROOF WAS HELD BY WARRIORS OF THE KINDREDS AND NOT BY A FEW OLD MEN AND WOMEN AND LADS THEREFORE HE HAD NO FEAR OF THEIR ESCAPING HIM
