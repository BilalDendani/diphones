4196-23901-0000 AT LAST THE PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETE
4196-23901-0001 ON THE EIGHTH OF MARCH GENERAL TAYLOR HAD AN ARMY OF NOT MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND MEN ONE BATTERY THE SIEGE GUNS AND ALL THE CONVALESCENT TROOPS WERE SENT ON BY WATER
4196-23901-0002 TO LOOK AFTER PUBLIC PROPERTY AND TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO WERE TOO SICK TO BE REMOVED THE REMAINDER OF THE ARMY PROBABLY NOT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MEN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE BRIGADES
4196-23901-0003 WITH THE CAVALRY INDEPENDENT COLONEL TWIGGS WITH SEVEN COMPANIES OF DRAGOONS AND A BATTERY OF LIGHT ARTILLERY MOVED ON THE EIGHTH HE WAS FOLLOWED
4196-23901-0004 IN VIEW OF THE IMMENSE BODIES OF MEN MOVED ON THE SAME DAY OVER NARROW ROADS THROUGH DENSE FORESTS AND ACROSS LARGE STREAMS IN OUR LATE WAR
4196-23901-0005 IT SEEMS STRANGE NOW THAT A BODY OF LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND MEN
4196-23901-0006 GENERAL TAYLOR WAS OPPOSED TO ANYTHING LIKE PLUNDERING BY THE TROOPS AND IN THIS INSTANCE I DOUBT NOT HE LOOKED UPON THE ENEMY AS THE AGGRIEVED PARTY
4196-23901-0007 AND WAS NOT WILLING TO INJURE THEM FURTHER THAN HIS INSTRUCTIONS FROM WASHINGTON DEMANDED HIS ORDERS TO THE TROOPS ENJOINED SCRUPULOUS REGARD FOR THE RIGHTS OF ALL PEACEABLE PERSONS AND THE PAYMENT
4196-23901-0008 WHEN IT DID NOT INTERFERE WITH THEIR MILITARY DUTIES AS ALREADY RELATED HAVING LOST MY FIVE OR SIX DOLLARS WORTH OF HORSES BUT A SHORT TIME BEFORE
4196-23901-0009 I DETERMINED NOT TO GET ANOTHER BUT TO MAKE THE JOURNEY ON FOOT MY COMPANY COMMANDER CAPTAIN MC CALL HAD TWO GOOD AMERICAN HORSES OF CONSIDERABLY MORE VALUE IN THAT COUNTRY WHERE NATIVE HORSES WERE CHEAP
4196-23901-0010 THAN THEY WERE IN THE STATES HE USED ONE HIMSELF AND WANTED THE OTHER FOR HIS SERVANT HE WAS QUITE ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER I DID NOT INTEND TO GET ME ANOTHER HORSE BEFORE THE MARCH BEGAN
4196-23901-0011 I TOLD HIM NO I BELONGED TO A FOOT REGIMENT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE OBJECT OF HIS SOLICITUDE AT THE TIME BUT WHEN WE WERE ABOUT TO START HE SAID THERE GRANT IS A HORSE FOR YOU
4196-23901-0012 I FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA OF HIS SERVANT RIDING ON A LONG MARCH WHILE HIS LIEUTENANT WENT A FOOT HE HAD FOUND A MUSTANG A THREE YEAR OLD COLT
4196-23901-0013 ONLY RECENTLY CAPTURED WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY ONE OF THE COLORED SERVANTS WITH THE REGIMENT FOR THE SUM OF THREE DOLLARS IT WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY HORSE AT CORPUS CHRISTI
4196-23901-0014 THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PURCHASED JUST THEN FOR ANY REASONABLE PRICE FIVE DOLLARS SIXTY SIX AND TWO THIRDS PER CENT ADVANCE INDUCED THE OWNER TO PART WITH THE MUSTANG
4196-23901-0015 I WAS SORRY TO TAKE HIM BECAUSE I REALLY FELT THAT BELONGING TO A FOOT REGIMENT IT WAS MY DUTY TO MARCH WITH THE MEN BUT I SAW THE CAPTAIN'S EARNESTNESS IN THE MATTER AND ACCEPTED THE HORSE FOR THE TRIP
4196-23901-0016 THE DAY WE STARTED WAS THE FIRST TIME THE HORSE HAD EVER BEEN UNDER SADDLE I HAD HOWEVER BUT LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN BREAKING HIM THOUGH FOR THE FIRST DAY THERE WERE FREQUENT DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN US
4196-23901-0017 AS TO WHICH WAY WE SHOULD GO AND SOMETIMES WHETHER WE SHOULD GO AT ALL AT NO TIME DURING THE DAY COULD I CHOOSE EXACTLY THE PART OF THE COLUMN I WOULD MARCH WITH
4196-23901-0018 BUT AFTER THAT I HAD AS TRACTABLE A HORSE AS ANY WITH THE ARMY AND THERE WAS NONE THAT STOOD THE TRIP BETTER HE NEVER ATE A MOUTHFUL OF FOOD ON THE JOURNEY EXCEPT THE GRASS HE COULD PICK
4196-23901-0019 WITHIN THE LENGTH OF HIS PICKET ROPE A FEW DAYS OUT FROM CORPUS CHRISTI THE IMMENSE HERD OF WILD HORSES THAT RANGED AT THAT TIME
4196-23901-0020 AND BUT A FEW MILES OFF IT WAS THE VERY BAND FROM WHICH THE HORSE I WAS RIDING HAD BEEN CAPTURED BUT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE COLUMN WAS HALTED FOR A REST AND A NUMBER OF OFFICERS MYSELF AMONG THEM
4196-23901-0021 RODE OUT TWO OR THREE MILES TO THE RIGHT TO SEE THE EXTENT OF THE HERD THE COUNTRY WAS A ROLLING PRAIRIE AND FROM THE HIGHER GROUND THE VISION WAS OBSTRUCTED ONLY BY THE EARTH'S CURVATURE
4196-23901-0022 AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH TO OUR RIGHT THE HERD EXTENDED TO THE LEFT IT EXTENDED EQUALLY THERE WAS NO ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS IN IT I HAVE NO IDEA
4196-23901-0023 THAT THEY COULD ALL HAVE BEEN CORRALLED IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND OR DELAWARE AT ONE TIME IF THEY HAD BEEN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO THICK THAT THE PASTURAGE WOULD HAVE GIVEN OUT THE FIRST DAY PEOPLE
4196-23901-0024 WHO SAW THE SOUTHERN HERD OF BUFFALO FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO CAN APPRECIATE THE SIZE OF THE TEXAS BAND OF WILD HORSES IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX AT THE POINT WHERE THE ARMY STRUCK THE LITTLE COLORADO RIVER
4196-23901-0025 THE STREAM WAS QUITE WIDE AND OF SUFFICIENT DEPTH FOR NAVIGATION THE WATER WAS BRACKISH AND THE BANKS WERE FRINGED WITH TIMBER HERE THE WHOLE ARMY CONCENTRATED BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO CROSS
4196-23901-0026 THE ARMY WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A PONTOON TRAIN AND AT THAT TIME THE TROOPS WERE NOT INSTRUCTED IN BRIDGE BUILDING TO ADD TO THE EMBARRASSMENT OF THE SITUATION THE ARMY WAS HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME THREATENED
4196-23901-0027 WITH OPPOSITION BUGLERS CONCEALED FROM OUR VIEW BY THE BRUSH ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE SOUNDED THE ASSEMBLY AND OTHER MILITARY CALLS
4196-23901-0028 IF THE TROOPS WERE IN PROPORTION TO THE NOISE THEY WERE SUFFICIENT TO DEVOUR GENERAL TAYLOR AND HIS ARMY
4196-23901-0029 IN WATCHING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE INVADER
4196-23901-0030 AND ALL OPPOSITION WAS SOON DISPERSED I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT A SINGLE SHOT WAS FIRED THE TROOPS WADED THE STREAM WHICH WAS UP TO THEIR NECKS IN THE DEEPEST PART
4196-23901-0031 TEAMS WERE CROSSED BY ATTACHING A LONG ROPE TO THE END OF THE WAGON TONGUE PASSING IT BETWEEN THE TWO SWING MULES AND BY THE SIDE OF THE LEADER
4196-23901-0032 HITCHING HIS BRIDLE AS WELL AS THE BRIDLE OF THE MULES IN REAR TO IT AND CARRYING THE END TO MEN ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE
4196-23901-0033 THE BANK DOWN TO THE WATER WAS STEEP ON BOTH SIDES A ROPE LONG ENOUGH TO CROSS THE RIVER THEREFORE WAS ATTACHED TO THE BACK AXLE OF THE WAGON AND MEN BEHIND WOULD HOLD THE ROPE
4196-23901-0034 TO PREVENT THE WAGON BEATING THE MULES INTO THE WATER THIS LATTER ROPE ALSO SERVED THE PURPOSE OF BRINGING THE END OF THE FORWARD ONE BACK TO BE USED OVER AGAIN
4196-23901-0035 TO SWIM THE LITTLE MEXICAN MULES WHICH THE ARMY WAS THEN USING BUT THEY AND THE WAGONS WERE PULLED THROUGH SO FAST BY THE MEN AT THE END OF THE ROPE AHEAD THAT NO TIME WAS LEFT THEM TO SHOW THEIR OBSTINACY
4196-23901-0036 IN THIS MANNER THE ARTILLERY AND TRANSPORTATION OF THE ARMY OF OCCUPATION CROSSED THE COLORADO RIVER ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH OF MARCH
4196-23901-0037 OPPOSITE THE CITY OF MATAMORAS AND ALMOST UNDER THE GUNS OF A SMALL FORT AT THE LOWER END OF THE TOWN THERE WAS NOT AT THAT TIME A SINGLE HABITATION FROM CORPUS CHRISTI
4196-23901-0038 THE LIMITS OF CAMP THEY CAPTURED TWO COMPANIES OF DRAGOONS COMMANDED BY CAPTAINS THORNTON AND HARDEE THE LATTER FIGURED AS A GENERAL IN THE LATE WAR ON THE CONFEDERATE SIDE
4196-23901-0039 OF THE FOURTH INFANTRY WAS KILLED WHILE OUT WITH A SMALL DETACHMENT AND MAJOR CROSS THE ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER GENERAL HAD ALSO BEEN KILLED NOT FAR FROM CAMP THERE WAS NO BASE OF SUPPLIES NEARER
4196-23901-0040 THAN POINT ISABEL ON THE COAST NORTH OF THE MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE AND
4196-23901-0041 THE ENEMY IF THE MEXICANS COULD BE CALLED SUCH AT THIS TIME WHEN NO WAR HAD BEEN DECLARED HOVERED ABOUT IN SUCH NUMBERS THAT IT WAS NOT SAFE TO SEND A WAGON TRAIN AFTER SUPPLIES WITH ANY ESCORT THAT COULD BE SPARED
4196-23901-0042 LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND MEN HE HAD HOWEVER A FEW MORE TROOPS AT POINT ISABEL OR BRAZOS SANTIAGO THE SUPPLIES BROUGHT FROM CORPUS CHRISTI IN WAGONS WERE RUNNING SHORT
4196-23901-0043 WORK WAS THEREFORE PUSHED WITH GREAT VIGOR ON THE DEFENCES TO ENABLE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF TROOPS TO HOLD THE FORT ALL THE MEN WHO COULD BE EMPLOYED WERE KEPT AT WORK FROM EARLY DAWN UNTIL DARKNESS CLOSED THE LABORS OF THE DAY
4196-23901-0044 WITH ALL THIS THE FORT WAS NOT COMPLETED UNTIL THE SUPPLIES GREW SO SHORT THAT FURTHER DELAY IN OBTAINING MORE COULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF
4196-23901-0045 BY THE LATTER PART OF APRIL THE WORK WAS IN A PARTIALLY DEFENSIBLE CONDITION AND THE SEVENTH INFANTRY MAJOR JACOB BROWN COMMANDING WAS MARCHED IN TO GARRISON IT WITH SOME FEW PIECES OF ARTILLERY
4196-23901-0046 ALL THE SUPPLIES ON HAND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ENOUGH TO CARRY THE REST OF THE ARMY TO POINT ISABEL WERE LEFT WITH THE GARRISON AND THE MARCH WAS COMMENCED WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE COMMAND EVERY WAGON BEING TAKEN WITH THE ARMY
