5325-50109-0000 THE INFLUENCE OF BEAUTY IN DETERMINING THE MARRIAGES OF MANKIND IN CIVILISED LIFE MAN IS LARGELY BUT BY NO MEANS EXCLUSIVELY INFLUENCED IN THE CHOICE OF HIS WIFE BY EXTERNAL APPEARANCE BUT WE ARE CHIEFLY CONCERNED WITH PRIMEVAL TIMES
5325-50109-0001 AND OUR ONLY MEANS OF FORMING A JUDGMENT ON THIS SUBJECT IS TO STUDY THE HABITS OF EXISTING SEMI CIVILISED AND SAVAGE NATIONS IF IT CAN BE SHEWN THAT THE MEN OF DIFFERENT RACES PREFER WOMEN HAVING VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS OR CONVERSELY WITH THE WOMEN
5325-50109-0002 WE HAVE THEN TO ENQUIRE WHETHER SUCH CHOICE CONTINUED DURING MANY GENERATIONS WOULD PRODUCE ANY SENSIBLE EFFECT ON THE RACE
5325-50109-0003 NECKLACES ARMLETS EAR RINGS ET CETERA THEY PAINT THEMSELVES IN THE MOST DIVERSIFIED MANNER IF PAINTED NATIONS AS HUMBOLDT OBSERVES HAD BEEN EXAMINED WITH THE SAME ATTENTION AS CLOTHED NATIONS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED THAT THE MOST FERTILE IMAGINATION
5325-50109-0004 HAVE CREATED THE FASHIONS OF PAINTING AS WELL AS THOSE OF GARMENTS IN ONE PART OF AFRICA THE EYELIDS ARE COLOURED BLACK IN ANOTHER THE NAILS ARE COLOURED YELLOW OR PURPLE IN MANY PLACES THE HAIR IS DYED OF VARIOUS TINTS
5325-50109-0005 IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THE TEETH ARE STAINED BLACK RED BLUE ET CETERA AND IN THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO IT IS THOUGHT SHAMEFUL TO HAVE WHITE TEETH LIKE THOSE OF A DOG NOT ONE GREAT COUNTRY CAN BE NAMED FROM THE POLAR REGIONS IN THE NORTH TO NEW ZEALAND IN THE SOUTH
5325-50109-0006 IN WHICH THE ABORIGINES DO NOT TATTOO THEMSELVES THIS PRACTICE WAS FOLLOWED BY THE JEWS OF OLD AND BY THE ANCIENT BRITONS IN AFRICA SOME OF THE NATIVES TATTOO THEMSELVES BUT IT IS A MUCH MORE COMMON PRACTICE TO RAISE PROTUBERANCES BY RUBBING SALT INTO INCISIONS
5325-50109-0007 MADE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY AND THESE ARE CONSIDERED BY THE INHABITANTS OF KORDOFAN AND DARFUR
5325-50109-0008 TRIED IN VAIN TO ALTER THIS FASHION IN VARIOUS PARTS OF AFRICA AND IN THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO THE NATIVES FILE THE INCISORS INTO POINTS LIKE THOSE OF A SAW OR PIERCE THEM WITH HOLES INTO WHICH THEY INSERT STUDS
5325-50109-0009 AS THE FACE WITH US IS CHIEFLY ADMIRED FOR ITS BEAUTY SO WITH SAVAGES IT IS THE CHIEF SEAT OF MUTILATION IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE WORLD THE SEPTUM AND MORE RARELY THE WINGS OF THE NOSE ARE PIERCED
5325-50109-0010 RINGS STICKS FEATHERS AND OTHER ORNAMENTS BEING INSERTED INTO THE HOLES THE EARS ARE EVERYWHERE PIERCED AND SIMILARLY ORNAMENTED AND WITH THE BOTOCUDOS AND LENGUAS OF SOUTH AMERICA THE HOLE IS GRADUALLY SO MUCH ENLARGED THAT THE LOWER EDGE TOUCHES THE SHOULDER
5325-50109-0011 IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND IN AFRICA EITHER THE UPPER OR LOWER LIP IS PIERCED AND WITH THE BOTOCUDOS THE HOLE IN THE LOWER LIP IS SO LARGE THAT A DISC OF WOOD FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER IS PLACED IN IT
5325-50109-0012 AND OF THE RIDICULE WHICH HE EXCITED WHEN HE SOLD HIS TEMBETA THE LARGE COLOURED PIECE OF WOOD WHICH IS PASSED THROUGH THE HOLE IN CENTRAL AFRICA THE WOMEN PERFORATE THE LOWER LIP AND WEAR A CRYSTAL WHICH FROM THE MOVEMENT OF THE TONGUE HAS A WRIGGLING MOTION
5325-50109-0013 FOR MANY OF THE OPERATIONS REQUIRE SEVERAL YEARS FOR THEIR COMPLETION
5325-50109-0014 AS THE WOMEN ARE MADE BY SAVAGES TO PERFORM THE GREATEST SHARE OF THE WORK AND AS THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT THE BEST KINDS OF FOOD SO IT ACCORDS WITH THE CHARACTERISTIC SELFISHNESS OF MAN THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO OBTAIN OR USE THE FINEST ORNAMENTS
5325-50109-0015 LASTLY IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT AS PROVED BY THE FOREGOING QUOTATIONS THAT THE SAME FASHIONS IN MODIFYING THE SHAPE OF THE HEAD IN ORNAMENTING THE HAIR IN PAINTING TATTOOING IN PERFORATING THE NOSE LIPS OR EARS
5325-50109-0016 IN REMOVING OR FILING THE TEETH ET CETERA NOW PREVAIL AND HAVE LONG PREVAILED IN THE MOST DISTANT QUARTERS OF THE WORLD IT IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT THESE PRACTICES FOLLOWED BY SO MANY DISTINCT NATIONS SHOULD BE DUE TO TRADITION FROM ANY COMMON SOURCE
5325-50109-0017 THEY INDICATE THE CLOSE SIMILARITY OF THE MIND OF MAN TO WHATEVER RACE HE MAY BELONG JUST AS DO THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL HABITS OF DANCING MASQUERADING AND MAKING RUDE PICTURES
5325-50109-0018 HAVING MADE THESE PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE ADMIRATION FELT BY SAVAGES FOR VARIOUS ORNAMENTS AND FOR DEFORMITIES MOST UNSIGHTLY IN OUR EYES LET US SEE HOW FAR THE MEN ARE ATTRACTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR WOMEN
5325-50109-0019 THAT THE CHINESE OF THE INTERIOR THINK EUROPEANS HIDEOUS WITH THEIR WHITE SKINS AND PROMINENT NOSES THE NOSE IS FAR FROM BEING TOO PROMINENT ACCORDING TO OUR IDEAS IN THE NATIVES OF CEYLON YET
5325-50109-0020 THE CHINESE IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY ACCUSTOMED TO THE FLAT FEATURES OF THE MONGOL RACES WERE SURPRISED AT THE PROMINENT NOSES OF THE CINGALESE AND THSANG DESCRIBED THEM AS HAVING THE BEAK OF A BIRD WITH THE BODY OF A MAN FINLAYSON
5325-50109-0021 AFTER MINUTELY DESCRIBING THE PEOPLE OF COCHIN CHINA SAYS THAT THEIR ROUNDED HEADS AND FACES ARE THEIR CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS AND HE ADDS THE ROUNDNESS OF THE WHOLE COUNTENANCE IS MORE STRIKING IN THE WOMEN WHO ARE RECKONED BEAUTIFUL IN PROPORTION AS THEY DISPLAY THIS FORM OF FACE
5325-50109-0022 AND ACCORDING TO BURTON THE SOMAL MEN ARE SAID TO CHOOSE THEIR WIVES BY RANGING THEM IN A LINE
5325-50109-0023 KNITTED THEIR BROWS AND SEEMED TO SHUDDER AT THE WHITENESS OF HIS SKIN ON THE EASTERN COAST THE NEGRO BOYS WHEN THEY SAW BURTON CRIED OUT LOOK AT THE WHITE MAN DOES HE NOT LOOK LIKE A WHITE APE
5325-50109-0024 THE NEGROES ADMIRE A VERY BLACK SKIN MORE THAN ONE OF A LIGHTER TINT BUT THEIR HORROR OF WHITENESS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO THIS SAME TRAVELLER PARTLY TO THE BELIEF HELD BY MOST NEGROES THAT DEMONS AND SPIRITS ARE WHITE AND PARTLY TO THEIR THINKING IT A SIGN OF ILL HEALTH
5325-50109-0025 THE BANYAI OF THE MORE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CONTINENT ARE NEGROES BUT A GREAT MANY OF THEM ARE OF A LIGHT COFFEE AND MILK COLOUR AND INDEED THIS COLOUR IS CONSIDERED HANDSOME THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY SO THAT HERE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD OF TASTE
5325-50109-0026 WITH THE KAFFIRS WHO DIFFER MUCH FROM NEGROES THE SKIN EXCEPT AMONG THE TRIBES NEAR DELAGOA BAY IS NOT USUALLY BLACK THE PREVAILING COLOUR BEING A MIXTURE OF BLACK AND RED THE MOST COMMON SHADE BEING CHOCOLATE DARK COMPLEXIONS AS BEING MOST COMMON
5325-50109-0027 ARE NATURALLY HELD IN THE HIGHEST ESTEEM TO BE TOLD THAT HE IS LIGHT COLOURED OR LIKE A WHITE MAN
5325-50109-0028 THE NATIVES SOMETIMES INCREASE THE APPARENT LENGTH OF THEIR HAIR
5325-50109-0029 ALTHOUGH THE HAIR ON THE HEAD IS THUS CHERISHED THAT ON THE FACE IS CONSIDERED BY THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS AS VERY VULGAR
5325-50109-0030 I HAVE MET WITH VERY FEW STATEMENTS OPPOSED TO THIS CONCLUSION
5325-50109-0031 NOT ONLY WITH THE NEGROES OF THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA
5325-50109-0032 IS CONVINCED THAT THEIR IDEAS OF BEAUTY ARE ON THE WHOLE THE SAME AS OURS AND DOCTOR ROHLFS WRITES TO ME TO THE SAME EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO BORNU AND THE COUNTRIES INHABITED BY THE PULLO TRIBES
5325-50109-0033 AND THAT THEIR APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTY OF EUROPEAN WOMEN CORRESPONDED WITH OURS THEY ADMIRE LONG HAIR AND USE ARTIFICIAL MEANS TO MAKE IT APPEAR ABUNDANT THEY ADMIRE ALSO A BEARD THOUGH THEMSELVES VERY SCANTILY PROVIDED
5325-50109-0034 A GIRL HAS BEEN HEARD TO SAY I DO NOT WANT TO MARRY HIM HE HAS GOT NO NOSE AND THIS SHEWS THAT A VERY FLAT NOSE IS NOT ADMIRED WE SHOULD HOWEVER BEAR IN MIND THAT THE DEPRESSED BROAD NOSES AND PROJECTING JAWS OF THE NEGROES OF THE WEST COAST
5325-50109-0035 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS
5325-50109-0036 THEY LOOK ON BLUE EYES WITH AVERSION
5325-50109-0037 THE SKULL HAS BEEN GREATLY MODIFIED DURING ANCIENT AND MODERN TIMES BY MANY NATIONS
5325-50109-0038 HUMBOLDT THINKS THAT THE AMERICAN INDIANS PREFER COLOURING THEIR BODIES WITH RED PAINT IN ORDER TO EXAGGERATE THEIR NATURAL TINT AND UNTIL RECENTLY EUROPEAN WOMEN ADDED TO THEIR NATURALLY BRIGHT COLOURS BY ROUGE AND WHITE COSMETICS
5325-50109-0039 BUT IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER BARBAROUS NATIONS HAVE GENERALLY HAD ANY SUCH INTENTION IN PAINTING THEMSELVES IN THE FASHIONS OF OUR OWN DRESS WE SEE EXACTLY THE SAME PRINCIPLE AND THE SAME DESIRE TO CARRY EVERY POINT TO AN EXTREME WE EXHIBIT ALSO THE SAME SPIRIT OF EMULATION
5325-50109-0040 BUT THE FASHIONS OF SAVAGES ARE FAR MORE PERMANENT THAN OURS AND WHENEVER THEIR BODIES ARE ARTIFICIALLY MODIFIED THIS IS NECESSARILY THE CASE THE ARAB WOMEN OF THE UPPER NILE OCCUPY ABOUT THREE DAYS IN DRESSING THEIR HAIR THEY NEVER IMITATE OTHER TRIBES
5325-50109-0041 THEY DO NOT ADMIRE A MEDIUM STANDARD
5325-50109-0042 THEY ADMIRE SOLELY WHAT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO
