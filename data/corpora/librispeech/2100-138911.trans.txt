2100-138911-0000 ALICE INSISTED ON BEING LEFT UP IN THE CHURCHYARD URGING THAT SHE WANTED TO THINK ABOUT IT ALL
2100-138911-0001 IF SHE WERE TO WALK DOWN WITH HER LOVER TO THE HOTEL TO THIS HE MADE NO OBJECTION AND ON REACHING THE INN MET MISTER PALLISER IN THE HALL MISTER PALLISER WAS ALREADY INSPECTING THE ARRANGEMENT OF CERTAIN LARGE TRUNKS WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN STAIRS
2100-138911-0002 AND WAS PREPARING FOR THEIR DEPARTURE HE WAS GOING ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH A NERVOUS SOLICITUDE TO DO SOMETHING AND WAS FLATTERING HIMSELF THAT HE WAS OF USE AS HE COULD NOT BE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER AND AS
2100-138911-0003 BY THE NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION SOME EMPLOYMENT WAS NECESSARY TO HIM HE WAS LOOKING TO THE CORDING OF THE BOXES GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HE SAID TO GREY HARDLY LOOKING AT HIM AS THOUGH TIME WERE TOO PRECIOUS WITH HIM TO ALLOW OF HIS TURNING HIS EYES UPON HIS FRIEND
2100-138911-0004 PERHAPS YOU'LL COME WITH ME TO THIS PROPOSITION MISTER GREY ASSENTED SOMETIMES YOU KNOW CONTINUED MISTER PALLISER THE SPRINGS OF THE CARRIAGES ARE SO VERY ROUGH THEN IN A VERY FEW WORDS
2100-138911-0005 MISTER GREY TOLD HIM WHAT HAD BEEN HIS OWN MORNING'S WORK HE HATED SECRETS AND SECRECY AND AS THE PALLISERS KNEW WELL WHAT HAD BROUGHT HIM UPON THEIR TRACK IT WAS HE THOUGHT WELL THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT HE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL
2100-138911-0006 MISTER PALLISER CONGRATULATED HIM VERY CORDIALLY AND THEN RUNNING UP STAIRS FOR HIS GLOVES OR HIS STICK OR MORE PROBABLY THAT HE MIGHT GIVE HIS WIFE ONE OTHER CAUTION AS TO HER CARE OF HERSELF
2100-138911-0007 HE TOLD HER ALSO THAT ALICE HAD YIELDED AT LAST OF COURSE SHE HAS SAID LADY GLENCORA I REALLY DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD SAID HE THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS OF THAT SORT SAID HIS WIFE
2100-138911-0008 THEN THE CAUTION WAS REPEATED THE MOTHER OF THE FUTURE DUKE WAS KISSED AND MISTER PALLISER WENT OFF ON HIS MISSION ABOUT THE CARRIAGE ITS CUSHIONS AND ITS SPRINGS IN THE COURSE OF THEIR WALK MISTER PALLISER SUGGESTED THAT
2100-138911-0009 AS THINGS WERE SETTLED SO PLEASANTLY MISTER GREY MIGHT AS WELL RETURN WITH THEM TO ENGLAND AND TO THIS SUGGESTION MISTER GREY ASSENTED ALICE REMAINED ALONE FOR NEARLY AN HOUR
2100-138911-0010 NO ONE DISTURBED HER IN THE CHURCHYARD NO STEPS WERE HEARD ALONG THE TOMBSTONES NO VOICE SOUNDED THROUGH THE CLOISTERS SHE WAS LEFT IN PERFECT SOLITUDE TO THINK OF THE PAST AND FORM HER PLANS OF THE FUTURE WAS SHE HAPPY
2100-138911-0011 NOW THAT THE MANNER OF HER LIFE TO COME WAS THUS SETTLED FOR HER THAT ALL FURTHER QUESTION AS TO THE DISPOSAL OF HERSELF WAS TAKEN OUT OF HER HANDS AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WITH A MAN SHE LOVED WAS SO FIRMLY ARRANGED THAT NO FURTHER FOLLY OF HER OWN COULD DISARRANGE IT
2100-138911-0012 SHE WAS HAPPY THOUGH SHE WAS SLOW TO CONFESS HER HAPPINESS TO HERSELF SHE WAS HAPPY AND SHE WAS RESOLUTE IN THIS THAT SHE WOULD NOW DO ALL SHE COULD TO MAKE HIM HAPPY ALSO AND THERE MUST NOW SHE ACKNOWLEDGED
2100-138911-0013 BE AN END TO HER PRIDE TO THAT PRIDE WHICH HAD HITHERTO TAUGHT HER TO THINK THAT SHE COULD MORE WISELY FOLLOW HER OWN GUIDANCE THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER WHO MIGHT CLAIM TO GUIDE HER SHE KNEW NOW THAT SHE MUST FOLLOW HIS GUIDANCE
2100-138911-0014 SHE HAD FOUND HER MASTER AS WE SOMETIMES SAY AND LAUGHED TO HERSELF WITH A LITTLE INWARD LAUGHTER AS SHE CONFESSED THAT IT WAS SO SHE WAS FROM HENCEFORTH ALTOGETHER IN HIS HANDS
2100-138911-0015 IF HE CHOSE TO TELL HER THAT THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AT MICHAELMAS OR AT CHRISTMAS OR ON LADY DAY THEY WOULD OF COURSE BE MARRIED ACCORDINGLY SHE HAD TAKEN HER FLING AT HAVING HER OWN WILL
2100-138911-0016 AND SHE AND ALL HER FRIENDS HAD SEEN WHAT HAD COME OF IT SHE HAD ASSUMED THE COMMAND OF THE SHIP AND HAD THROWN IT UPON THE ROCKS AND SHE FELT THAT SHE NEVER OUGHT TO TAKE THE CAPTAIN'S PLACE AGAIN
2100-138911-0017 IT WAS WELL FOR HER THAT HE WHO WAS TO BE CAPTAIN WAS ONE WHOM SHE RESPECTED AS THOROUGHLY AS SHE LOVED HIM SHE WOULD WRITE TO HER FATHER AT ONCE TO HER FATHER AND LADY MACLEOD AND WOULD CONFESS EVERYTHING
2100-138911-0018 SHE FELT THAT SHE OWED IT TO THEM THAT THEY SHOULD BE TOLD BY HERSELF THAT THEY HAD BEEN RIGHT AND THAT SHE HAD BEEN WRONG HITHERTO SHE HAD NOT MENTIONED TO EITHER OF THEM THE FACT THAT MISTER GREY WAS WITH THEM IN SWITZERLAND AND THEN
2100-138911-0019 WHAT MUST SHE DO AS TO LADY MIDLOTHIAN AS TO LADY MIDLOTHIAN SHE WOULD DO NOTHING LADY MIDLOTHIAN OF COURSE WOULD TRIUMPH WOULD JUMP UPON HER AS LADY GLENCORA HAD ONCE EXPRESSED IT
2100-138911-0020 WITH VERY TRIUMPHANT HEELS WOULD TRY TO PATRONIZE HER OR WHICH WOULD BE ALMOST WORSE WOULD MAKE A PARADE OF HER FORGIVENESS BUT SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH LADY MIDLOTHIAN UNLESS INDEED
2100-138911-0021 MISTER GREY SHOULD ORDER IT THEN SHE LAUGHED AT HERSELF AGAIN WITH THAT INWARD LAUGHTER AND RISING FROM HER SEAT PROCEEDED TO WALK DOWN THE HILL TO THE HOTEL VANQUISHED AT LAST SAID LADY GLENCORA AS ALICE ENTERED THE ROOM
2100-138911-0022 YES VANQUISHED IF YOU LIKE TO CALL IT SO SAID ALICE IT IS NOT WHAT I CALL IT BUT WHAT YOU FEEL IT SAID THE OTHER DO YOU THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH TO BE SURE THAT YOU REGARD YOURSELF NOW
2100-138911-0023 AS AN UNFORTUNATE PRISONER AS A CAPTIVE TAKEN IN WAR TO BE LED AWAY IN TRIUMPH WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF A RANSOM I KNOW THAT IT IS QUITE A MISERY TO YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE MADE A HAPPY WOMAN OF AT LAST
2100-138911-0024 OF COURSE I KNEW THAT WAS THE WAY YOU WOULD TREAT ME IN WHAT WAY WOULD YOU HAVE ME TREAT YOU IF I WERE TO HUG YOU WITH JOY AND TELL YOU HOW GOOD HE IS AND HOW FORTUNATE YOU ARE IF I WERE TO PRAISE HIM
2100-138911-0025 AND BID YOU TRIUMPH IN YOUR SUCCESS AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED ON SUCH AN OCCASION YOU WOULD PUT ON A LONG FACE AT ONCE AND TELL ME THAT THOUGH THE THING IS TO BE
2100-138911-0026 DON'T I KNOW YOU ALICE I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT NOT NOW I BELIEVE IN MY HEART YOU WOULD THAT OR SOMETHING LIKE IT BUT I DO WISH YOU JOY ALL THE SAME AND YOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE
2100-138911-0027 NO I SHALL NOT GO BACK AGAIN I WOULD JOIN WITH LADY MIDLOTHIAN IN PUTTING YOU INTO A MADHOUSE IF YOU DID BUT I AM SO GLAD I AM INDEED I WAS AFRAID TO THE LAST TERRIBLY AFRAID
2100-138911-0028 YOU ARE SO HARD AND SO PROUD I DON'T MEAN HARD TO ME DEAR
2100-138911-0029 BUT YOU ARE HARD TO YOURSELF AND UPON MY WORD YOU HAVE BEEN HARD TO HIM WHAT A DEAL YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE UP TO HIM I FEEL THAT I OUGHT TO STAND BEFORE HIM ALWAYS AS A PENITENT IN A WHITE SHEET
2100-138911-0030 HE WILL LIKE IT BETTER I DARE SAY IF YOU WILL SIT UPON HIS KNEE SOME PENITENTS DO YOU KNOW AND HOW HAPPY YOU WILL BE HE'LL NEVER EXPLAIN THE SUGAR DUTIES TO YOU AND THERE'LL BE NO MISTER BOTT AT NETHERCOATS
2100-138911-0031 THEY SAT TOGETHER THE WHOLE MORNING WHILE MISTER PALLISER WAS SEEING TO THE SPRINGS AND CUSHIONS
2100-138911-0032 AS SHE DID SO HER FRIEND ENJOYED IT WITH HER AND AT LAST THEY HAD SOMETHING OF THE COMFORT AND EXCITEMENT WHICH SUCH AN OCCASION SHOULD GIVE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ALICE YOU SHALL COME AND BE MARRIED AT MATCHING IN AUGUST OR PERHAPS SEPTEMBER
2100-138911-0033 THAT'S THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH I CAN BE PRESENT AND IF WE CAN BESPEAK SOME SUN WE'LL HAVE THE BREAKFAST OUT IN THE RUINS ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY ALL STARTED TOGETHER A FIRST CLASS COMPARTMENT HAVING BEEN TAKEN FOR THE PALLISER FAMILY
2100-138911-0034 AND A SECOND CLASS COMPARTMENT CLOSE TO THEM FOR THE PALLISER SERVANTS MISTER PALLISER AS HE SLOWLY HANDED HIS WIFE IN WAS A TRIUMPHANT MAN AS WAS ALSO MISTER GREY AS HE HANDED IN HIS LADY LOVE
2100-138911-0035 THOUGH IN A MANNER MUCH LESS MANIFEST WE MAY SAY THAT BOTH THE GENTLEMEN HAD BEEN VERY FORTUNATE WHILE AT LUCERNE MISTER PALLISER HAD COME ABROAD WITH A FEELING THAT ALL THE WORLD HAD BEEN CUT FROM UNDER HIS FEET
2100-138911-0036 A GREAT CHANGE WAS NEEDED FOR HIS WIFE AND HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED AT ONCE THAT EVERYTHING MUST BE MADE TO YIELD TO THAT NECESSITY HE CERTAINLY HAD HIS REWARD NOW IN HIS TRIUMPHANT RETURN
2100-138911-0037 TERRIBLE TROUBLES HAD AFFLICTED HIM AS HE WENT WHICH SEEMED NOW TO HAVE DISSIPATED THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER WHEN HE THOUGHT OF BURGO FITZGERALD HE REMEMBERED HIM ONLY AS A POOR UNFORTUNATE FELLOW
2100-138911-0038 FOR WHOM HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO DO SOMETHING IF THE DOING OF ANYTHING WERE ONLY IN HIS POWER AND HE HAD IN HIS POCKET A LETTER WHICH HE HAD THAT MORNING RECEIVED FROM THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY MARKED PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL
2100-138911-0039 WHICH WAS IN ITS NATURE VERY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL AND IN WHICH HE WAS TOLD THAT LORD BROCK AND MISTER FINESPUN WERE TOTALLY AT VARIANCE ABOUT FRENCH WINES MISTER FINESPUN WANTED TO DO SOMETHING NOW IN THE RECESS
2100-138911-0040 TO SEND SOME POLITICAL AGENT OVER TO FRANCE TO WHICH LORD BROCK WOULD NOT AGREE AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS DISAGREEMENT HERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER CHANCE IF ONLY MISTER PALLISER COULD GIVE UP HIS WINTER IN ITALY
2100-138911-0041 MISTER PALLISER AS HE TOOK HIS PLACE OPPOSITE HIS WIFE WAS VERY TRIUMPHANT AND MISTER GREY WAS TRIUMPHANT AS HE PLACED HIMSELF GENTLY IN HIS SEAT OPPOSITE TO ALICE
2100-138911-0042 HE SEEMED TO ASSUME NO RIGHT AS HE TOOK THAT POSITION APPARENTLY BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONE WHICH CAME NATURALLY TO HIS LOT
2100-138911-0043 SIMPLY BY SEEING HIS ARRANGEMENTS FOR HER COMFORT HE MADE NO LOUD ASSERTION AS TO HIS PROPERTY AND HIS RIGHTS AS SOME MEN DO HE WAS QUIET AND SUBDUED IN HIS JOY BUT NOT THE LESS WAS HE TRIUMPHANT
2100-138911-0044 FROM THE DAY ON WHICH ALICE HAD ACCEPTED HIS FIRST OFFER NAY FROM AN EARLIER DAY THAN THAT FROM THE DAY ON WHICH HE HAD FIRST RESOLVED TO MAKE IT DOWN TO THE PRESENT HOUR HE HAD NEVER BEEN STIRRED FROM HIS PURPOSE
2100-138911-0045 BY EVERY WORD THAT HE HAD SAID AND BY EVERY ACT THAT HE HAD DONE HE HAD SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE UNMOVED BY THAT EPISODE IN THEIR JOINT LIVES WHICH ALICE'S OTHER FRIENDS HAD REGARDED AS SO FATAL
2100-138911-0046 WHEN SHE FIRST REJECTED HIM HE WOULD NOT TAKE HIS REJECTION WHEN SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE INTENDED TO MARRY HER COUSIN HE SILENTLY DECLINED TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH MARRIAGE WOULD EVER TAKE PLACE HE HAD NEVER GIVEN HER UP FOR A DAY
2100-138911-0047 AND NOW THE EVENT PROVED THAT HE HAD BEEN RIGHT
2100-138911-0048 HE WAS CLOSE TO HER AS SHE STOOD THERE SO CLOSE THAT PUTTING OUT HER HAND FOR HIS SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE IT AND PRESS IT CLOSELY YOU ARE THINKING OF SOMETHING ALICE HE SAID WHAT IS IT IT WAS HERE
2100-138911-0049 SHE SAID HERE ON THIS VERY BALCONY THAT I FIRST REBELLED AGAINST YOU
2100-138911-0050 I COULD GO FROM VIENNA TO LONDON WITHOUT FEELING IT SHE SAID WITH INDIGNATION
2100-138911-0051 MISTER PALLISER HAD BEEN AFRAID TO BE IMPERIOUS AND THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY ON HIS ARRIVAL AT ONE OF THE STATIONS IN BASLE HE HAD POSTED ACROSS THE TOWN IN THE HEAT AND THE DUST
2100-138911-0052 I'VE A PARTICULAR FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU LADY GLENCORA SAID TO HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE TOGETHER
2100-138911-0053 MISTER PALLISER DECLARED THAT HE WOULD GRANT HER ANY PARTICULAR FAVOUR ONLY PREMISING THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THEREBY COMMITTED HIMSELF TO ANY ENGAGEMENT UNDER WHICH HIS WIFE SHOULD HAVE AUTHORITY TO TAKE ANY EXERTION UPON HERSELF
2100-138911-0054 I WISH I WERE A MILKMAID SAID LADY GLENCORA BUT YOU ARE NOT A MILKMAID MY DEAR YOU HAVEN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP LIKE A MILKMAID BUT WHAT WAS THE FAVOUR IF SHE WOULD ONLY ASK FOR JEWELS
2100-138911-0055 THOUGH THEY WERE THE GRAND DUCHESS'S DIAMOND EARDROPS HE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO GET THEM FOR HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE QUAFFED MOLTEN PEARLS LIKE CLEOPATRA HE WOULD HAVE PROCURED THE BEVERAGE
2100-138911-0056 HAVING FIRST FORTIFIED HIMSELF WITH A MEDICAL OPINION AS TO THE FITNESS OF THE DRINK FOR A LADY IN HER CONDITION THERE WAS NO EXPENDITURE THAT HE WOULD NOT WILLINGLY INCUR FOR HER NOTHING COSTLY THAT HE WOULD GRUDGE
2100-138911-0057 BUT WHEN SHE ASKED FOR A FAVOUR HE WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF AN IMPRUDENCE
2100-138911-0058 AND HER REQUEST WAS AT LAST OF THIS NATURE I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME UP TO THE GAMBLING ROOMS
2100-138911-0059 SAID MISTER PALLISER IN DISMAY YES PLANTAGENET THE GAMBLING ROOMS IF YOU HAD BEEN WITH ME BEFORE I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE A FOOL OF MYSELF BY PUTTING MY PIECE OF MONEY ON THE TABLE I WANT TO SEE THE PLACE BUT THEN I SAW NOTHING
2100-138911-0060 BECAUSE I WAS SO FRIGHTENED WHEN I FOUND THAT I WAS WINNING MISTER PALLISER WAS AWARE THAT ALL THE WORLD OF BADEN OR RATHER THE WORLD OF THE STRANGERS AT BADEN ASSEMBLES ITSELF IN THOSE SALONS
2100-138911-0061 IT MAY BE ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW MEN LOOKED WHEN THEY LOST THEIR OWN MONEY OR WON THAT OF OTHERS HE KNEW HOW A MINISTER LOOKED WHEN HE LOST OR GAINED A TAX
2100-138911-0062 HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH MILLIONS AND TENS OF MILLIONS IN A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE HE KNEW THE EXCITEMENT OF A NEAR DIVISION UPON THE ESTIMATES BUT HE HAD NEVER YET SEEN A POOR MAN STAKE HIS LAST NAPOLEON
2100-138911-0063 AND RAKE BACK FROM OFF THE TABLE A SMALL HATFUL OF GOLD A LITTLE EXERCISE AFTER AN EARLY DINNER WAS HE HAD BEEN TOLD GOOD FOR HIS WIFE AND HE AGREED THEREFORE THAT ON THEIR SECOND EVENING AT BADEN
2100-138911-0064 THEY WOULD ALL WALK UP AND SEE THE PLAY PERHAPS I SHALL GET BACK MY NAPOLEON SAID GLENCORA TO ALICE AND PERHAPS I SHALL BE FORGIVEN WHEN SOMEBODY SEES HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO MANAGE YOU SAID ALICE LOOKING AT MISTER PALLISER
2100-138911-0065 SHE ISN'T IN EARNEST SAID MISTER PALLISER ALMOST FEARING THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT I DON'T KNOW THAT SAID LADY GLENCORA THEY STARTED TOGETHER MISTER PALLISER WITH HIS WIFE
2100-138911-0066 AND MISTER GREY WITH ALICE ON HIS ARM AND FOUND ALL THE TABLES AT WORK THEY AT FIRST WALKED THROUGH THE DIFFERENT ROOMS WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER THEIR COMMENTS ON THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SAW
2100-138911-0067 AND LISTENING TO THE QUICK LOW MONOTONOUS WORDS OF THE CROUPIERS AS THEY ARRANGED AND PRESIDED OVER THE GAMES EACH TABLE WAS CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY ITS OWN CROWD MADE UP OF PLAYERS EMBRYO PLAYERS AND SIMPLE LOOKERS ON
2100-138911-0068 BUT THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR LADY GLENCORA SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THESE MEN AND WOMEN WERE DOING TO SEE WHETHER THE CROUPIERS WORE HORNS ON THEIR HEADS AND WERE DEVILS INDEED
2100-138911-0069 AND OF THOSE WHO WERE TRIUMPHANT TO KNOW HOW THE THING WAS DONE AND TO LEARN SOMETHING OF THAT LESSON IN LIFE LET US STAND HERE A MOMENT SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND ARRESTING HIM AT ONE CORNER OF THE TABLE WHICH HAD THE GREATEST CROWD
2100-138911-0070 WE SHALL BE ABLE TO SEE IN A FEW MINUTES SO HE STOOD WITH HER THERE GIVING WAY TO ALICE WHO WENT IN FRONT WITH HIS WIFE AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO AN APERTURE WAS MADE SO THAT THEY COULD ALL SEE THE MARKED CLOTH AND THE MONEY LYING ABOUT
2100-138911-0071 AND THE RAKES ON THE TABLE AND THE CROUPIER SKILFULLY DEALING HIS CARDS AND MORE INTERESTING THAN ALL THE REST THE FACES OF THOSE WHO WERE PLAYING GREY LOOKED ON OVER ALICE'S SHOULDER VERY ATTENTIVELY
2100-138911-0072 BUT BOTH OF THEM KEPT THEIR EYES UPON THE MINISTERS OF THE WORK ALICE AND GLENCORA DID THE SAME AT FIRST BUT AS THEY GAINED COURAGE THEY GLANCED ROUND UPON THE GAMBLERS IT WAS A LONG TABLE HAVING OF COURSE
2100-138911-0073 FOUR CORNERS AND AT THE CORNER APPROPRIATED BY THEM THEY WERE PARTLY OPPOSITE TO THE MAN WHO DEALT THE CARDS THE CORNER ANSWERING TO THEIRS AT THE OTHER END WAS THE PART OF THE TABLE MOST REMOVED FROM THEIR SIGHT
2100-138911-0074 AND THAT ON WHICH THEIR EYES FELL LAST AS LADY GLENCORA STOOD SHE COULD HARDLY SEE INDEED AT FIRST SHE COULD NOT SEE
2100-138911-0075 MISTER PALLISER WHO WAS BEHIND HER COULD NOT SEE THEM AT ALL BUT TO ALICE AND TO MISTER GREY HAD HE CARED ABOUT IT EVERY FACE AT THE TABLE WAS VISIBLE EXCEPT THE FACES OF THOSE WHO WERE IMMEDIATELY CLOSE TO THEM
2100-138911-0076 BEFORE LONG ALICE'S ATTENTION WAS RIVETED ON THE ACTION AND COUNTENANCE OF ONE YOUNG MAN WHO SAT AT THAT OTHER CORNER HE WAS LEANING AT FIRST LISTLESSLY OVER THE TABLE DRESSED IN A VELVETEEN JACKET
2100-138911-0077 AND WITH HIS ROUND TOPPED HAT BROUGHT FAR OVER HIS EYES SO THAT SHE COULD NOT FULLY SEE HIS FACE BUT SHE HAD HARDLY BEGUN TO OBSERVE HIM BEFORE HE THREW BACK HIS HAT AND TAKING SOME PIECES OF GOLD FROM UNDER HIS LEFT HAND
2100-138911-0078 WHICH LAY UPON THE TABLE PUSHED THREE OR FOUR OF THEM ON TO ONE OF THE DIVISIONS MARKED ON THE CLOTH HE SEEMED TO SHOW NO CARE AS OTHERS DID AS TO THE SPECIAL SPOT WHICH THEY SHOULD OCCUPY MANY WERE VERY PARTICULAR IN THIS RESPECT
2100-138911-0079 PLACING THEIR VENTURES ON THE LINES SO AS TO SHARE THE FORTUNES OF TWO COMPARTMENTS OR SOMETIMES OF FOUR OR THEY DIVIDED THEIR COINS TAKING THREE OR FOUR NUMBERS SELECTING THE NUMBERS WITH ALMOST GROTESQUE ATTENTION TO SOME IMAGINED RULE OF THEIR OWN
2100-138911-0080 BUT THIS MAN LET HIS GOLD GO ALL TOGETHER AND LEFT IT WHERE HIS HALF STRETCHED RAKE DEPOSITED IT BY CHANCE ALICE COULD NOT BUT LOOK AT HIS FACE HIS EYES SHE COULD SEE WERE BLOODSHOT AND HIS HAIR
2100-138911-0081 WHEN HE PUSHED BACK HIS HAT WAS ROUGH AND DISHEVELLED BUT STILL THERE WAS THAT IN HIS FACE WHICH NO WOMAN COULD SEE AND NOT REGARD IT WAS A FACE WHICH AT ONCE PREPOSSESSED HER IN HIS FAVOUR AS IT HAD ALWAYS PREPOSSESSED ALL OTHERS
2100-138911-0082 ON THIS OCCASION HE HAD WON HIS MONEY AND ALICE SAW HIM DRAG IT IN AS LAZILY AS HE HAD PUSHED IT OUT DO YOU SEE THAT LITTLE FRENCHMAN SAID LADY GLENCORA HE HAS JUST MADE HALF A NAPOLEON AND HAS WALKED OFF WITH IT ISN'T IT INTERESTING
2100-138911-0083 I COULD STAY HERE ALL THE NIGHT THEN SHE TURNED ROUND TO WHISPER SOMETHING TO HER HUSBAND AND ALICE'S EYES AGAIN FELL ON THE FACE OF THE MAN AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE AFTER HE HAD WON HIS MONEY HE HAD ALLOWED THE GAME TO GO ON FOR A TURN
2100-138911-0084 WITHOUT ANY ACTION ON HIS PART THE GOLD AGAIN WENT UNDER HIS HAND AND HE LOUNGED FORWARD WITH HIS HAT OVER HIS EYES ONE OF THE CROUPIERS HAD SAID A WORD AS THOUGH CALLING HIS ATTENTION TO THE GAME BUT HE HAD MERELY SHAKEN HIS HEAD
2100-138911-0085 BUT WHEN THE FATE OF THE NEXT TURN HAD BEEN DECIDED HE AGAIN ROUSED HIMSELF AND ON THIS OCCASION AS FAR AS ALICE COULD SEE PUSHED HIS WHOLE STOCK FORWARD WITH THE RAKE THERE WAS A LITTLE MASS OF GOLD AND FROM HIS MANNER OF PLACING IT
2100-138911-0086 ALL MIGHT SEE THAT HE LEFT ITS POSITION TO CHANCE ONE PIECE HAD GOT BEYOND ITS BOUNDARY AND THE CROUPIER PUSHED IT BACK WITH SOME HALF EXPRESSED INQUIRY AS TO HIS CORRECTNESS ALL RIGHT
2100-138911-0087 THEN LADY GLENCORA STARTED AND CLUTCHED ALICE'S ARM WITH HER HAND MISTER PALLISER WAS EXPLAINING TO MISTER GREY BEHIND THEM SOMETHING ABOUT GERMAN FINANCE AS CONNECTED WITH GAMBLING TABLES AND DID NOT HEAR THE VOICE OR SEE HIS WIFE'S MOTION
2100-138911-0088 I NEED HARDLY TELL THE READER THAT THE GAMBLER WAS BURGO FITZGERALD BUT LADY GLENCORA SAID NOT A WORD NOT AS YET SHE LOOKED FORWARD VERY GENTLY BUT STILL WITH EAGER EYES
2100-138911-0089 TILL SHE COULD JUST SEE THE FACE SHE KNEW SO WELL HIS HAT WAS NOW PUSHED BACK AND HIS COUNTENANCE HAD LOST ITS LISTLESSNESS HE WATCHED NARROWLY THE FACE OF THE MAN AS HE TOLD OUT THE AMOUNT OF THE CARDS AS THEY WERE DEALT
2100-138911-0090 HE DID NOT TRY TO HIDE HIS ANXIETY AND WHEN AFTER THE TELLING OF SOME SIX OR SEVEN CARDS HE HEARD A CERTAIN NUMBER NAMED AND A CERTAIN COLOUR CALLED HE MADE SOME EXCLAMATION WHICH EVEN GLENCORA COULD NOT HEAR
2100-138911-0091 AND THEN ANOTHER CROUPIER PUT DOWN CLOSE TO BURGO'S MONEY CERTAIN ROLLS OF GOLD DONE UP IN PAPER AND ALSO CERTAIN LOOSE NAPOLEONS WHY DOESN'T HE TAKE IT SAID LADY GLENCORA HE IS TAKING IT SAID ALICE
2100-138911-0092 NOT AT ALL KNOWING THE CAUSE OF HER COUSIN'S ANXIETY BURGO HAD PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN PREPARED TO RAKE THE MONEY TO HIM BUT AS HE DID SO HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND PUSHED IT ALL BACK AGAIN NOW ON THIS OCCASION
2100-138911-0093 BEING VERY CAREFUL TO PLACE IT ON ITS FORMER SPOT BOTH ALICE AND GLENCORA COULD SEE THAT A MAN AT HIS ELBOW WAS DISSUADING HIM HAD EVEN ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE ARM WHICH HELD THE RAKE
2100-138911-0094 BUT BURGO SHOOK HIM OFF SPEAKING TO HIM SOME WORD ROUGHLY AND THEN AGAIN HE STEADIED THE ROLLS UPON THEIR APPOINTED PLACE THE CROUPIER WHO HAD PAUSED FOR A MOMENT NOW WENT ON QUICKLY WITH HIS CARDS
2100-138911-0095 AND IN TWO MINUTES THE FATE OF BURGO'S WEALTH WAS DECIDED IT WAS ALL DRAWN BACK BY THE CROUPIER'S UNIMPASSIONED RAKE AND THE ROLLS OF GOLD WERE RESTORED TO THE TRAY FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN
2100-138911-0096 BURGO LOOKED UP AND SMILED AT THEM ALL ROUND THE TABLE BY THIS TIME MOST OF THOSE WHO STOOD AROUND WERE LOOKING AT HIM HE WAS A MAN WHO GATHERED EYES UPON HIM WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE
2100-138911-0097 AND ON THE LAST OCCASION THE AMOUNT STAKED HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLE HE KNEW THAT MEN AND WOMEN WERE LOOKING AT HIM AND THEREFORE HE SMILED FAINTLY AS HE TURNED HIS EYES ROUND THE TABLE THEN HE GOT UP AND PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS
2100-138911-0098 WHISTLED AS HE WALKED AWAY HIS COMPANION FOLLOWED HIM AND LAID A HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER BUT BURGO SHOOK HIM OFF AND WOULD NOT TURN ROUND HE SHOOK HIM OFF AND WALKED ON WHISTLING THE LENGTH OF THE WHOLE SALON
2100-138911-0099 ALICE SAID LADY GLENCORA IT IS BURGO FITZGERALD MISTER PALLISER HAD GONE SO DEEP INTO THAT QUESTION OF GERMAN FINANCE THAT HE HAD NOT AT ALL NOTICED THE GAMBLER ALICE WHAT CAN WE DO FOR HIM
2100-138911-0100 IT IS BURGO SAID LADY GLENCORA MANY EYES WERE NOW WATCHING HIM USED AS HE WAS TO THE WORLD AND TO MISFORTUNE HE WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN HIS ATTEMPT TO BEAR HIS LOSS WITH A SHOW OF INDIFFERENCE
2100-138911-0101 THE MOTION OF HIS HEAD THE POSITION OF HIS HANDS THE TONE OF HIS WHISTLING ALL TOLD THE TALE EVEN THE UNIMPASSIONED CROUPIERS FURTIVELY CAST AN EYE AFTER HIM
2100-138911-0102 AND A VERY BIG GUARD IN A COCKED HAT AND UNIFORM AND SWORD WHO HITHERTO HAD HARDLY BEEN AWAKE SEEMED EVIDENTLY TO BE INTERESTED BY HIS MOVEMENTS IF THERE IS TO BE A TRAGEDY AT THESE PLACES AND TRAGEDIES WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR
2100-138911-0103 IT IS ALWAYS AS WELL THAT THE TRAGIC SCENE SHOULD BE AS FAR REMOVED AS POSSIBLE FROM THE SALONS IN ORDER THAT THE PUBLIC EYE SHOULD NOT SUFFER LADY GLENCORA AND ALICE HAD LEFT THEIR PLACES AND HAD SHRUNK BACK ALMOST BEHIND A PILLAR
2100-138911-0104 IS IT HE IN TRUTH ALICE ASKED IN VERY TRUTH SAID GLENCORA WHAT CAN I DO CAN I DO ANYTHING LOOK AT HIM ALICE
2100-138911-0105 BURGO CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS THE REGARDED OF ALL EYES TURNED ROUND UPON HIS HEEL AND AGAIN WALKED THE LENGTH OF THE SALON HE KNEW WELL THAT HE HAD NOT A FRANC LEFT IN HIS POSSESSION
2100-138911-0106 HIS COMPANION WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE HAD SLUNK AWAY FROM HIM NOT CARING TO SHARE THE NOTORIETY WHICH NOW ATTENDED HIM WHAT SHALL I DO ALICE SAID LADY GLENCORA WITH HER EYES STILL FIXED ON HIM WHO HAD BEEN HER LOVER
2100-138911-0107 TELL MISTER PALLISER WHISPERED ALICE
2100-138911-0108 AND TOOK HIM AWAY FROM MISTER GREY RAPIDLY SHE TOLD HER STORY WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT MISTER PALLISER COULD HARDLY GET IN A WORD DO SOMETHING FOR HIM DO DO UNLESS I KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS DONE I SHALL DIE YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID
2100-138911-0109 I'M NOT AFRAID SAID MISTER PALLISER LADY GLENCORA AS SHE WENT ON QUICKLY GOT HOLD OF HER HUSBAND'S HAND AND CARESSED IT YOU ARE SO GOOD SAID SHE

2100-138911-0115 THEY BOTH WALKED TO THE END OF THE ROW OF BUILDINGS AND THEN BURGO LEAVING THE BROAD WAY TURNED INTO A LITTLE PATH WHICH LED UP THROUGH THE TREES TO THE HILLS THAT HILLSIDE AMONG THE TREES IS A POPULAR RESORT AT BADEN DURING THE DAY
2100-138911-0116 BUT NOW AT NINE IN THE EVENING IT WAS DESERTED PALLISER DID NOT PRESS ON THE OTHER MAN BUT FOLLOWED HIM AND DID NOT ACCOST BURGO TILL HE HAD THROWN HIMSELF ON THE GRASS BENEATH A TREE
