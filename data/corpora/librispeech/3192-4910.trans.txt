3192-4910-0012 VICKERS PROMISED AND KEPT HIS PROMISE SO FAR AS TO CHAT CHEERILY WITH BLUNT AND FRERE AT DINNER ONLY WRITING A BRIEF NOTE TO HIS WIFE TO TELL HER THAT WHATEVER SHE HEARD SHE WAS NOT TO STIR FROM HER CABIN UNTIL HE CAME TO HER
3192-4910-0013 HE KNEW THAT WITH ALL HIS WIFE'S FOLLY SHE WOULD OBEY UNHESITATINGLY WHEN HE COUCHED AN ORDER IN SUCH TERMS ACCORDING TO THE USUAL CUSTOM ON BOARD CONVICT SHIPS THE GUARDS RELIEVED EACH OTHER EVERY TWO HOURS AND AT SIX P M THE POOP GUARD WAS REMOVED TO THE QUARTER DECK
3192-4910-0014 AND THE ARMS WHICH IN THE DAYTIME WERE DISPOSED ON THE TOP OF THE ARM CHEST WERE PLACED IN AN ARM RACK CONSTRUCTED ON THE QUARTER DECK FOR THAT PURPOSE TRUSTING NOTHING TO FRERE WHO INDEED BY PINE'S ADVICE WAS AS WE HAVE SEEN
3192-4910-0015 KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF THE WHOLE MATTER VICKERS ORDERED ALL THE MEN SAVE THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ON GUARD DURING THE DAY TO BE UNDER ARMS IN THE BARRACK FORBADE COMMUNICATION WITH THE UPPER DECK AND PLACED AS SENTRY AT THE BARRACK DOOR HIS OWN SERVANT
3192-4910-0016 AN OLD SOLDIER ON WHOSE FIDELITY HE COULD THOROUGHLY RELY HE THEN DOUBLED THE GUARDS TOOK THE KEYS OF THE PRISON HIMSELF FROM THE NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO KEEP THEM AND SAW THAT THE HOWITZER ON THE LOWER DECK WAS LOADED WITH GRAPE
3192-4910-0017 WOULD HAVE SEEN AN UNUSUAL SIGHT THAT GALLANT COMMANDER WAS SITTING ON THE BED PLACE WITH A GLASS OF RUM AND WATER IN HIS HAND AND THE HANDSOME WAITING MAID OF MISSUS VICKERS WAS SEATED ON A STOOL BY HIS SIDE AT A FIRST GLANCE IT WAS PERCEPTIBLE THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS VERY DRUNK
3192-4910-0018 HIS GREY HAIR WAS MATTED ALL WAYS ABOUT HIS REDDENED FACE AND HE WAS WINKING AND BLINKING LIKE AN OWL IN THE SUNSHINE HE HAD DRUNK A LARGER QUANTITY OF WINE THAN USUAL AT DINNER IN SHEER DELIGHT AT THE APPROACHING ASSIGNATION

3192-4910-0026 HICCUPED WITH MUCH SOLEMNITY THRICE AND AS THOUGH STRUCK WITH A SUDDEN SENSE OF DUTY UNFULFILLED SWALLOWED THE CONTENTS AT A GULP THE EFFECT WAS ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS HE DROPPED THE TUMBLER LURCHED TOWARDS THE WOMAN AT THE DOOR
3192-4910-0027 AND THEN MAKING A HALF TURN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MOTION OF THE VESSEL FELL INTO HIS BUNK AND SNORED LIKE A GRAMPUS SARAH PURFOY WATCHED HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN HAVING BLOWN OUT THE LIGHT
3192-4910-0028 STEPPED OUT OF THE CABIN AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER THE DUSKY GLOOM WHICH HAD HELD THE DECK ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT ENVELOPED ALL FORWARD OF THE MAIN MAST A LANTERN SWUNG IN THE FORECASTLE AND SWAYED WITH THE MOTION OF THE SHIP
3192-4910-0029 AND IN THE CUDDY AT HER RIGHT HAND THE USUAL ROW OF OIL LAMPS BURNED SHE LOOKED MECHANICALLY FOR VICKERS WHO WAS ORDINARILY THERE AT THAT HOUR BUT THE CUDDY WAS EMPTY SO MUCH THE BETTER SHE THOUGHT
3192-4910-0030 AS SHE DREW HER DARK CLOAK AROUND HER AND TAPPED AT FRERE'S DOOR
3192-4910-0031 WITH A STRONG EFFORT SHE DISPELLED THE DIZZINESS THAT HAD ALMOST OVERPOWERED HER AND HELD HERSELF ERECT IT WOULD NEVER DO TO BREAK DOWN NOW THE DOOR OPENED AND MAURICE FRERE DREW HER INTO THE CABIN SO YOU HAVE COME SAID HE

3192-4910-0036 THE MUTINY HAD BEGUN THE SOUND AWOKE THE SOLDIER TO A SENSE OF HIS DUTY HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND DISENGAGING THE ARMS THAT CLUNG ABOUT HIS NECK MADE FOR THE DOOR THE MOMENT FOR WHICH THE CONVICT'S ACCOMPLICE HAD WAITED APPROACHED
