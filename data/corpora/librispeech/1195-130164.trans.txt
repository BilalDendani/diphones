1195-130164-0004 WHICH WERE RATHER BELIED BY EXPLOSIONS OF LAUGHTER WHEN THE TWO GOT TOGETHER SEVERAL DAYS OF UNUSUALLY MILD WEATHER FITLY USHERED IN A SPLENDID CHRISTMAS DAY

1195-130164-0012 SLAPPING THE POCKET WHEREIN REPOSED THE LONG DESIRED UNDINE AND SINTRAM I'M SURE I AM ECHOED AMY PORING OVER THE ENGRAVED COPY OF THE MADONNA AND CHILD WHICH HER MOTHER HAD GIVEN HER IN A PRETTY FRAME
1195-130164-0013 OF COURSE I AM CRIED MEG SMOOTHING THE SILVERY FOLDS OF HER FIRST SILK DRESS FOR MISTER LAURENCE HAD INSISTED ON GIVING IT HOW CAN I BE OTHERWISE SAID MISSUS MARCH GRATEFULLY
1195-130164-0014 AS HER EYES WENT FROM HER HUSBAND'S LETTER TO BETH'S SMILING FACE AND HER HAND CARRESSED THE BROOCH MADE OF GRAY AND GOLDEN CHESTNUT AND DARK BROWN HAIR WHICH THE GIRLS HAD JUST FASTENED ON HER BREAST
1195-130164-0015 NOW AND THEN IN THIS WORKADAY WORLD THINGS DO HAPPEN IN THE DELIGHTFUL STORYBOOK FASHION
1195-130164-0016 HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE TURNED A SOMERSAULT AND UTTERED AN INDIAN WAR WHOOP FOR HIS FACE WAS SO FULL OF SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT AND HIS VOICE SO TREACHEROUSLY JOYFUL THAT EVERYONE JUMPED UP
1195-130164-0017 HERE'S ANOTHER CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR THE MARCH FAMILY BEFORE THE WORDS WERE WELL OUT OF HIS MOUTH HE WAS WHISKED AWAY SOMEHOW AND IN HIS PLACE APPEARED A TALL MAN MUFFLED UP TO THE EYES LEANING ON THE ARM OF ANOTHER TALL MAN
1195-130164-0018 MISTER MARCH BECAME INVISIBLE IN THE EMBRACE OF FOUR PAIRS OF LOVING ARMS JO DISGRACED HERSELF BY NEARLY FAINTING AWAY AND HAD TO BE DOCTORED BY LAURIE IN THE CHINA CLOSET MISTER BROOKE KISSED MEG ENTIRELY BY MISTAKE
1195-130164-0019 AS HE SOMEWHAT INCOHERENTLY EXPLAINED AND AMY THE DIGNIFIED TUMBLED OVER A STOOL AND NEVER STOPPING TO GET UP HUGGED AND CRIED OVER HER FATHER'S BOOTS IN THE MOST TOUCHING MANNER MISSUS MARCH WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER HERSELF
1195-130164-0020 AND HELD UP HER HAND WITH A WARNING HUSH REMEMBER BETH BUT IT WAS TOO LATE THE STUDY DOOR FLEW OPEN THE LITTLE RED WRAPPER APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD JOY PUT STRENGTH INTO THE FEEBLE LIMBS
1195-130164-0021 AND BETH RAN STRAIGHT INTO HER FATHER'S ARMS NEVER MIND WHAT HAPPENED JUST AFTER THAT FOR THE FULL HEARTS OVERFLOWED WASHING AWAY THE BITTERNESS OF THE PAST AND LEAVING ONLY THE SWEETNESS OF THE PRESENT
1195-130164-0022 IT WAS NOT AT ALL ROMANTIC BUT A HEARTY LAUGH SET EVERYBODY STRAIGHT AGAIN FOR HANNAH WAS DISCOVERED BEHIND THE DOOR SOBBING OVER THE FAT TURKEY WHICH SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO PUT DOWN WHEN SHE RUSHED UP FROM THE KITCHEN AS THE LAUGH SUBSIDED
1195-130164-0023 MISSUS MARCH BEGAN TO THANK MISTER BROOKE FOR HIS FAITHFUL CARE OF HER HUSBAND AT WHICH MISTER BROOKE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT MISTER MARCH NEEDED REST AND SEIZING LAURIE HE PRECIPITATELY RETIRED THEN THE TWO INVALIDS WERE ORDERED TO REPOSE WHICH THEY DID
1195-130164-0024 BY BOTH SITTING IN ONE BIG CHAIR AND TALKING HARD MISTER MARCH TOLD HOW HE HAD LONGED TO SURPRISE THEM AND HOW WHEN THE FINE WEATHER CAME HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED BY HIS DOCTOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT
1195-130164-0025 HOW DEVOTED BROOKE HAD BEEN AND HOW HE WAS ALTOGETHER A MOST ESTIMABLE AND UPRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHY MISTER MARCH PAUSED A MINUTE JUST THERE AND AFTER A GLANCE AT MEG WHO WAS VIOLENTLY POKING THE FIRE
1195-130164-0026 LOOKED AT HIS WIFE WITH AN INQUIRING LIFT OF THE EYEBROWS I LEAVE YOU TO IMAGINE ALSO WHY MISSUS MARCH GENTLY NODDED HER HEAD AND ASKED RATHER ABRUPTLY
1195-130164-0027 THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A CHRISTMAS DINNER AS THEY HAD THAT DAY THE FAT TURKEY WAS A SIGHT TO BEHOLD WHEN HANNAH SENT HIM UP STUFFED BROWNED AND DECORATED SO WAS THE PLUM PUDDING
1195-130164-0028 IN WHICH AMY REVELED LIKE A FLY IN A HONEYPOT EVERYTHING TURNED OUT WELL WHICH WAS A MERCY HANNAH SAID
1195-130164-0029 LET ALONE BILIN OF IT IN A CLOTH MISTER LAURENCE AND HIS GRANDSON DINED WITH THEM ALSO MISTER BROOKE AT WHOM JO GLOWERED DARKLY TO LAURIE'S INFINITE AMUSEMENT TWO EASY CHAIRS STOOD SIDE BY SIDE AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE
1195-130164-0030 IN WHICH SAT BETH AND HER FATHER FEASTING MODESTLY ON CHICKEN AND A LITTLE FRUIT THEY DRANK HEALTHS TOLD STORIES SANG SONGS REMINISCED AS THE OLD FOLKS SAY AND HAD A THOROUGHLY GOOD TIME A SLEIGH RIDE HAD BEEN PLANNED
1195-130164-0031 BUT THE GIRLS WOULD NOT LEAVE THEIR FATHER SO THE GUESTS DEPARTED EARLY AND AS TWILIGHT GATHERED THE HAPPY FAMILY SAT TOGETHER ROUND THE FIRE JUST A YEAR AGO WE WERE GROANING OVER THE DISMAL CHRISTMAS WE EXPECTED TO HAVE
1195-130164-0032 AND CONGRATULATING HERSELF ON HAVING TREATED MISTER BROOKE WITH DIGNITY I THINK IT'S BEEN A PRETTY HARD ONE OBSERVED AMY WATCHING THE LIGHT SHINE ON HER RING WITH THOUGHTFUL EYES I'M GLAD IT'S OVER
1195-130164-0033 BECAUSE WE'VE GOT YOU BACK WHISPERED BETH WHO SAT ON HER FATHER'S KNEE RATHER A ROUGH ROAD FOR YOU TO TRAVEL MY LITTLE PILGRIMS ESPECIALLY THE LATTER PART OF IT
1195-130164-0034 BUT YOU HAVE GOT ON BRAVELY AND I THINK THE BURDENS ARE IN A FAIR WAY TO TUMBLE OFF VERY SOON SAID MISTER MARCH LOOKING WITH FATHERLY SATISFACTION AT THE FOUR YOUNG FACES GATHERED ROUND HIM
1195-130164-0035 OH TELL US WHAT THEY ARE CRIED MEG WHO SAT BESIDE HIM HERE IS ONE AND TAKING UP THE HAND WHICH LAY ON THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR HE POINTED TO THE ROUGHENED FOREFINGER A BURN ON THE BACK
1195-130164-0036 A BURNT OFFERING HAS BEEN MADE TO VANITY THIS HARDENED PALM HAS EARNED SOMETHING BETTER THAN BLISTERS AND I'M SURE THE SEWING DONE BY THESE PRICKED FINGERS WILL LAST A LONG TIME SO MUCH GOOD WILL WENT INTO THE STITCHES MEG MY DEAR
1195-130164-0037 I VALUE THE WOMANLY SKILL WHICH KEEPS HOME HAPPY MORE THAN WHITE HANDS OR FASHIONABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS I'M PROUD TO SHAKE THIS GOOD INDUSTRIOUS LITTLE HAND AND HOPE I SHALL NOT SOON BE ASKED TO GIVE IT AWAY
1195-130164-0038 IF MEG HAD WANTED A REWARD FOR HOURS OF PATIENT LABOR SHE RECEIVED IT IN THE HEARTY PRESSURE OF HER FATHER'S HAND AND THE APPROVING SMILE HE GAVE HER WHAT ABOUT JO
1195-130164-0039 PLEASE SAY SOMETHING NICE FOR SHE HAS TRIED SO HARD AND BEEN SO VERY VERY GOOD TO ME SAID BETH IN HER FATHER'S EAR HE LAUGHED AND LOOKED ACROSS AT THE TALL GIRL WHO SAT OPPOSITE
1195-130164-0040 HER FACE IS RATHER THIN AND PALE JUST NOW WITH WATCHING AND ANXIETY BUT I LIKE TO LOOK AT IT FOR IT HAS GROWN GENTLER AND HER VOICE IS LOWER SHE DOESN'T BOUNCE BUT MOVES QUIETLY
1195-130164-0041 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE SHEARING SOBERED OUR BLACK SHEEP BUT I DO KNOW THAT IN ALL WASHINGTON I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO BE BOUGHT WITH THE FIVE AND TWENTY DOLLARS
1195-130164-0042 NOW BETH SAID AMY LONGING FOR HER TURN BUT READY TO WAIT THERE'S SO LITTLE OF HER I'M AFRAID TO SAY MUCH FOR FEAR SHE WILL SLIP AWAY ALTOGETHER THOUGH SHE IS NOT SO SHY AS SHE USED TO BE
1195-130164-0043 RAN ERRANDS FOR HER MOTHER ALL THE AFTERNOON GAVE MEG HER PLACE TONIGHT AND HAS WAITED ON EVERY ONE WITH PATIENCE AND GOOD HUMOR I ALSO OBSERVE THAT SHE DOES NOT FRET MUCH NOR LOOK IN THE GLASS
1195-130164-0044 AND HAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED A VERY PRETTY RING WHICH SHE WEARS SO I CONCLUDE THAT SHE HAS LEARNED TO THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE MORE AND OF HERSELF LESS AND HAS DECIDED TO TRY AND MOLD HER CHARACTER AS CAREFULLY AS SHE MOLDS HER LITTLE CLAY FIGURES
1195-130164-0045 I AM GLAD OF THIS FOR THOUGH I SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF A GRACEFUL STATUE MADE BY HER I SHALL BE INFINITELY PROUDER OF A LOVABLE DAUGHTER WITH A TALENT FOR MAKING LIFE BEAUTIFUL TO HERSELF AND OTHERS
1195-130164-0046 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF BETH ASKED JO WHEN AMY HAD THANKED HER FATHER AND TOLD ABOUT HER RING I READ IN PILGRIM'S PROGRESS TODAY
1195-130164-0047 BEFORE THEY WENT ON TO THEIR JOURNEY'S END ANSWERED BETH ADDING AS SHE SLIPPED OUT OF HER FATHER'S ARMS
1195-130164-0048 IT'S SINGING TIME NOW AND I WANT TO BE IN MY OLD PLACE I'LL TRY TO SING THE SONG OF THE SHEPHERD BOY WHICH THE PILGRIMS HEARD I MADE THE MUSIC FOR FATHER BECAUSE HE LIKES THE VERSES
1195-130164-0049 SO SITTING AT THE DEAR LITTLE PIANO BETH SOFTLY TOUCHED THE KEYS AND IN THE SWEET VOICE THEY HAD NEVER THOUGHT TO HEAR AGAIN SANG TO HER OWN ACCOMPANIMENT THE QUAINT HYMN
