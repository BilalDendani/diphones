3072-155948-0000 THE REASON WHY I WAS ALONE IN THE MOUNTAINS ON THIS OCCASION WAS BECAUSE FOR THE ONLY TIME IN ALL MY EXPERIENCE I HAD A DIFFICULTY WITH MY GUIDE HE WAS A CRIPPLED OLD MOUNTAIN MAN WITH A PROFOUND CONTEMPT FOR TENDERFEET
3072-155948-0001 A CONTEMPT THAT IN MY CASE WAS ACCENTUATED BY THE FACT THAT I WORE SPECTACLES WHICH AT THAT DAY AND IN THAT REGION WERE USUALLY HELD TO INDICATE A DEFECTIVE MORAL CHARACTER IN THE WEARER
3072-155948-0002 OR AS HE EXPRESSED IT TRUNDLED A TENDERFOOT AND THOUGH A GOOD HUNTER WHO SHOWED ME MUCH GAME OUR EXPERIENCE TOGETHER WAS NOT HAPPY HE WAS VERY RHEUMATIC AND LIKED TO LIE ABED LATE SO THAT I USUALLY HAD TO GET BREAKFAST AND IN FACT DO MOST OF THE WORK AROUND CAMP
3072-155948-0003 FINALLY ONE DAY HE DECLINED TO GO OUT WITH ME SAYING THAT HE HAD A PAIN WHEN THAT AFTERNOON I GOT BACK TO CAMP I SPEEDILY FOUND WHAT THE PAIN WAS WE WERE TRAVELING VERY LIGHT INDEED
3072-155948-0004 I HAVING PRACTICALLY NOTHING BUT MY BUFFALO SLEEPING BAG MY WASH KIT AND A PAIR OF SOCKS I HAD ALSO TAKEN A FLASK OF WHISKY FOR EMERGENCIES ALTHOUGH AS I FOUND THAT THE EMERGENCIES NEVER AROSE AND THAT TEA WAS BETTER THAN WHISKY WHEN A MAN WAS COLD OR DONE OUT
3072-155948-0005 WHEN I GOT BACK TO CAMP THE OLD FELLOW WAS SITTING ON A TREE TRUNK VERY ERECT WITH HIS RIFLE ACROSS HIS KNEES AND IN RESPONSE TO MY NOD OF GREETING HE MERELY LEERED AT ME I LEANED MY RIFLE AGAINST A TREE WALKED OVER TO WHERE MY BED WAS LYING
3072-155948-0006 AND HAPPENING TO RUMMAGE IN IT FOR SOMETHING I FOUND THE WHISKY FLASK WAS EMPTY I TURNED ON HIM AT ONCE AND ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING DRUNK IT TO WHICH HE MERELY RESPONDED BY ASKING WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO ABOUT IT THERE DID NOT SEEM MUCH TO DO SO I SAID THAT WE WOULD PART COMPANY
3072-155948-0007 WE WERE ONLY FOUR OR FIVE DAYS FROM A SETTLEMENT AND I WOULD GO IN ALONE TAKING ONE OF THE HORSES HE RESPONDED BY COCKING HIS RIFLE AND SAYING THAT I COULD GO ALONE AND BE DAMNED TO ME BUT I COULD NOT TAKE ANY HORSE I ANSWERED ALL RIGHT THAT IF I COULD NOT I COULD NOT
3072-155948-0008 AND BEGAN TO MOVE AROUND TO GET SOME FLOUR AND SALT PORK
3072-155948-0009 MY RIFLE WAS LEANING AGAINST A TREE NEAR THE COOKING THINGS TO HIS RIGHT MANAGING TO GET NEAR IT I WHIPPED IT UP AND THREW THE BEAD ON HIM CALLING HANDS UP HE OF COURSE PUT UP HIS HANDS AND THEN SAID OH COME I WAS ONLY JOKING TO WHICH I ANSWERED WELL I AM NOT
3072-155948-0010 NOW STRAIGHTEN YOUR LEGS AND LET YOUR RIFLE GO TO THE GROUND HE REMONSTRATED SAYING THE RIFLE WOULD GO OFF AND I TOLD HIM TO LET IT GO OFF HOWEVER HE STRAIGHTENED HIS LEGS IN SUCH FASHION THAT IT CAME TO THE GROUND WITHOUT A JAR I THEN MADE HIM MOVE BACK AND PICKED UP THE RIFLE
3072-155948-0011 BY THIS TIME HE WAS QUITE SOBER AND REALLY DID NOT SEEM ANGRY LOOKING AT ME QUIZZICALLY HE TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD GIVE HIM BACK HIS RIFLE HE WOULD CALL IT QUITS AND WE COULD GO ON TOGETHER
3072-155948-0012 HE SAID HE HAD NO INTENTION OF COMING AFTER ME AND AS HE WAS VERY MUCH CRIPPLED WITH RHEUMATISM I DID NOT BELIEVE HE WOULD DO SO ACCORDINGLY I TOOK THE LITTLE MARE WITH NOTHING BUT SOME FLOUR BACON AND TEA AND MY BED ROLL AND STARTED OFF
3072-155948-0013 AT THE BLASTED PINE I LOOKED ROUND AND AS I COULD SEE HIM IN CAMP I LEFT HIS RIFLE THERE I THEN TRAVELED TILL DARK AND THAT NIGHT FOR THE ONLY TIME IN MY EXPERIENCE I USED IN CAMPING A TRICK OF THE OLD TIME TRAPPERS IN THE INDIAN DAYS
3072-155948-0014 SO AFTER GETTING SUPPER WHILE MY PONY FED ROUND I LEFT THE FIRE BURNING REPACKED THE MARE AND PUSHED AHEAD UNTIL IT LITERALLY BECAME SO DARK THAT I COULD NOT SEE THEN I PICKETED THE MARE SLEPT WHERE I WAS WITHOUT A FIRE UNTIL THE FIRST STREAK OF DAWN
3072-155948-0015 AND THEN PUSHED ON FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE HALTING TO TAKE BREAKFAST AND TO LET THE LITTLE MARE HAVE A GOOD FEED NO PLAINSMAN NEEDS TO BE TOLD THAT A MAN SHOULD NOT LIE NEAR A FIRE IF THERE IS DANGER OF AN ENEMY CREEPING UP ON HIM
3072-155948-0016 AND THAT ABOVE ALL A MAN SHOULD NOT PUT HIMSELF IN A POSITION WHERE HE CAN BE AMBUSHED AT DAWN ON THIS SECOND DAY I LOST THE TRAIL AND TOWARD NIGHTFALL GAVE UP THE EFFORT TO FIND IT CAMPED WHERE I WAS AND WENT OUT TO SHOOT A GROUSE FOR SUPPER
3072-155948-0017 IT WAS WHILE HUNTING IN VAIN FOR A GROUSE THAT I CAME ON THE BEAR AND KILLED IT AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WHEN I REACHED THE SETTLEMENT AND WENT INTO THE STORE THE STOREKEEPER IDENTIFIED ME BY REMARKING YOU'RE THE TENDERFOOT THAT OLD HANK WAS TRUNDLING AIN'T YOU
3072-155948-0018 I ADMITTED THAT I WAS A GOOD MANY YEARS LATER AFTER I HAD BEEN ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT I WENT ON A COUGAR HUNT IN NORTHWESTERN COLORADO WITH JOHNNY GOFF A FAMOUS HUNTER AND MOUNTAIN MAN IT WAS MIDWINTER
3072-155948-0019 BUT MERELY AS JOHNNY GOFF'S TOURIST OF COURSE DURING THE YEARS WHEN I WAS MOST BUSY AT SERIOUS WORK I COULD DO NO HUNTING AND EVEN MY RIDING WAS OF A DECOROUS KIND
3072-155948-0020 BUT A MAN WHOSE BUSINESS IS SEDENTARY SHOULD GET SOME KIND OF EXERCISE IF HE WISHES TO KEEP HIMSELF IN AS GOOD PHYSICAL TRIM AS HIS BRETHREN WHO DO MANUAL LABOR WHEN I WORKED ON A RANCH I NEEDED NO FORM OF EXERCISE EXCEPT MY WORK BUT WHEN I WORKED IN AN OFFICE THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
3072-155948-0021 THE ONLY ONLOOKERS BEING THE MEMBERS OF OUR FAITHFUL FAMILIES MY TWO PONIES WERE THE ONLY OCCUPANTS OF MY STABLE EXCEPT A CART HORSE MY WIFE AND I RODE AND DROVE THEM AND THEY WERE USED FOR HOUSEHOLD ERRANDS AND FOR THE CHILDREN AND FOR TWO AFTERNOONS A WEEK THEY SERVED ME AS POLO PONIES
3072-155948-0022 POLO IS A GOOD GAME INFINITELY BETTER FOR VIGOROUS MEN THAN TENNIS OR GOLF OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND THERE IS ALL THE FUN OF FOOTBALL WITH THE HORSE THROWN IN
3072-155948-0023 BUT AT OYSTER BAY OUR GREAT AND PERMANENT AMUSEMENTS WERE ROWING AND SAILING I DO NOT CARE FOR THE LATTER AND AM FOND OF THE FORMER I SUPPOSE IT SOUNDS ARCHAIC BUT I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THE PEOPLE WITH MOTOR BOATS MISS A GREAT DEAL
3072-155948-0024 IF THEY WOULD ONLY KEEP TO ROWBOATS OR CANOES AND USE OAR OR PADDLE THEMSELVES THEY WOULD GET INFINITELY MORE BENEFIT THAN BY HAVING THEIR WORK DONE FOR THEM BY GASOLINE BUT I RARELY TOOK EXERCISE MERELY AS EXERCISE PRIMARILY I TOOK IT BECAUSE I LIKED IT
3072-155948-0025 PLAY SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH WORK AND A LIFE DEVOTED MERELY TO PLAY IS OF ALL FORMS OF EXISTENCE THE MOST DISMAL BUT THE JOY OF LIFE IS A VERY GOOD THING AND WHILE WORK IS THE ESSENTIAL IN IT PLAY ALSO HAS ITS PLACE
3072-155948-0026 WHEN OBLIGED TO LIVE IN CITIES I FOR A LONG TIME FOUND THAT BOXING AND WRESTLING ENABLED ME TO GET A GOOD DEAL OF EXERCISE IN CONDENSED AND ATTRACTIVE FORM I WAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO ABANDON BOTH AS I GREW OLDER
3072-155948-0027 I DROPPED THE WRESTLING EARLIEST WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR THE CHAMPION MIDDLEWEIGHT WRESTLER OF AMERICA HAPPENED TO BE IN ALBANY AND I GOT HIM TO COME ROUND THREE OR FOUR AFTERNOONS A WEEK
3072-155948-0028 WHO REFUSED TO AUDIT A BILL I PUT IN FOR A WRESTLING MAT EXPLAINING THAT I COULD HAVE A BILLIARD TABLE BILLIARDS BEING RECOGNIZED AS A PROPER GUBERNATORIAL AMUSEMENT BUT THAT A WRESTLING MAT SYMBOLIZED SOMETHING UNUSUAL AND UNHEARD OF AND COULD NOT BE PERMITTED
3072-155948-0029 HE WAS NEARLY AS PLEASED AS I WAS WHEN I TOLD HIM I THOUGHT WE WOULD VOTE THE WAR A FAILURE AND ABANDON WRESTLING AFTER THAT I TOOK UP BOXING AGAIN WHILE PRESIDENT I USED TO BOX WITH SOME OF THE AIDES AS WELL AS PLAY SINGLE STICK WITH GENERAL WOOD
3072-155948-0030 AFTER A FEW YEARS I HAD TO ABANDON BOXING AS WELL AS WRESTLING FOR IN ONE BOUT A YOUNG CAPTAIN OF ARTILLERY CROSS COUNTERED ME ON THE EYE AND THE BLOW SMASHED THE LITTLE BLOOD VESSELS FORTUNATELY IT WAS MY LEFT EYE BUT THE SIGHT HAS BEEN DIM EVER SINCE
3072-155948-0031 AND IF IT HAD BEEN THE RIGHT EYE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNABLE TO SHOOT ACCORDINGLY I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD BECOME AN ELDERLY MAN AND WOULD HAVE TO STOP BOXING
3072-155948-0032 WHEN I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS WORKING VERY HARD WITH LITTLE CHANCE OF GETTING OUT OF DOORS ALL THE EXERCISE I GOT WAS BOXING AND WRESTLING A YOUNG FELLOW TURNED UP WHO WAS A SECOND RATE PRIZE FIGHTER THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLD BOXING TEACHERS
3072-155948-0033 FOR SEVERAL WEEKS I HAD HIM COME ROUND TO MY ROOMS IN THE MORNING TO PUT ON THE GLOVES WITH ME FOR HALF AN HOUR THEN HE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND SOME DAYS LATER I RECEIVED A LETTER OF WOE FROM HIM FROM THE JAIL I FOUND THAT HE WAS BY PROFESSION A BURGLAR
3072-155948-0034 AND MERELY FOLLOWED BOXING AS THE AMUSEMENT OF HIS LIGHTER MOMENTS OR WHEN BUSINESS WAS SLACK
3072-155948-0035 AND TO MOST OF THOSE I KNEW I GREW GENUINELY ATTACHED I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE OUTCRY AGAINST PRIZE FIGHTERS THE ONLY OBJECTION I HAVE TO THE PRIZE RING IS THE CROOKEDNESS THAT HAS ATTENDED ITS COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
3072-155948-0036 MOST CERTAINLY PRIZE FIGHTING IS NOT HALF AS BRUTALIZING OR DEMORALIZING AS MANY FORMS OF BIG BUSINESS AND OF THE LEGAL WORK CARRIED ON IN CONNECTION WITH BIG BUSINESS POWERFUL VIGOROUS MEN OF STRONG ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT MUST HAVE SOME WAY IN WHICH THEIR ANIMAL SPIRITS CAN FIND VENT
3072-155948-0037 WHEN I WAS POLICE COMMISSIONER I FOUND AND JACOB RIIS WILL BACK ME UP IN THIS THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BOXING CLUB IN A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD ALWAYS TENDED TO DO AWAY WITH KNIFING AND GUN FIGHTING AMONG THE YOUNG FELLOWS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN IN MURDEROUS GANGS
3072-155948-0038 BUT THEY HAD TO HAVE SOME OUTLET FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME WAY I HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED BOXING AS A FIRST CLASS SPORT TO ENCOURAGE IN THE YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION I DO NOT LIKE TO SEE YOUNG CHRISTIANS WITH SHOULDERS THAT SLOPE LIKE A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE
3072-155948-0039 OF COURSE BOXING SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED IN THE ARMY AND NAVY I WAS FIRST DRAWN TO TWO NAVAL CHAPLAINS FATHERS CHIDWICK AND RAINEY BY FINDING THAT EACH OF THEM HAD BOUGHT HALF A DOZEN SETS OF BOXING GLOVES AND ENCOURAGED THEIR CREWS IN BOXING
3072-155948-0040 WHEN I WAS POLICE COMMISSIONER I HEARTILY APPROVED THE EFFORT TO GET BOXING CLUBS STARTED IN NEW YORK ON A CLEAN BASIS LATER I WAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PRIZE RING HAD BECOME HOPELESSLY DEBASED AND DEMORALIZED
3072-155948-0041 AND AS GOVERNOR I AIDED IN THE PASSAGE OF AND SIGNED THE BILL PUTTING A STOP TO PROFESSIONAL BOXING FOR MONEY THIS WAS BECAUSE SOME OF THE PRIZE FIGHTERS THEMSELVES WERE CROOKED
3072-155948-0042 WHILE THE CROWD OF HANGERS ON WHO ATTENDED AND MADE UP AND PROFITED BY THE MATCHES HAD PLACED THE WHOLE BUSINESS ON A BASIS OF COMMERCIALISM AND BRUTALITY THAT WAS INTOLERABLE I SHALL ALWAYS MAINTAIN THAT BOXING CONTESTS THEMSELVES MAKE GOOD HEALTHY SPORT
3072-155948-0043 IT IS IDLE TO COMPARE THEM WITH BULL FIGHTING THE TORTURE AND DEATH OF THE WRETCHED HORSES IN BULL FIGHTING IS ENOUGH OF ITSELF TO BLAST THE SPORT NO MATTER HOW GREAT THE SKILL AND PROWESS SHOWN BY THE BULL FIGHTERS
3072-155948-0044 THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED IN A GLOVE FIGHT OR BARE FIST FIGHT TO STOP IT WHEN ONE COMPETITOR IS HOPELESSLY OUTCLASSED OR TOO BADLY HAMMERED BUT THE MEN WHO TAKE PART IN THESE FIGHTS ARE HARD AS NAILS
3072-155948-0045 AND IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO FEEL SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THEIR RECEIVING PUNISHMENT WHICH AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY DO NOT MIND OF COURSE THE MEN WHO LOOK ON OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP WITH THE GLOVES OR WITHOUT THEM THEMSELVES
3072-155948-0046 I HAVE SCANT USE FOR THE TYPE OF SPORTSMANSHIP WHICH CONSISTS MERELY IN LOOKING ON AT THE FEATS OF SOME ONE ELSE SOME AS GOOD CITIZENS AS I KNOW ARE OR WERE PRIZE FIGHTERS TAKE MIKE DONOVAN OF NEW YORK
3072-155948-0047 MIKE IS A DEVOTED TEMPERANCE MAN AND CAN BE RELIED UPON FOR EVERY MOVEMENT IN THE INTEREST OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP
3072-155948-0048 ONE EVENING HE AND I BOTH IN DRESS SUITS ATTENDED A TEMPERANCE MEETING OF CATHOLIC SOCIETIES IT CULMINATED IN A LIVELY SET TO BETWEEN MYSELF AND A TAMMANY SENATOR WHO WAS A VERY GOOD FELLOW BUT WHOSE IDEAS OF TEMPERANCE DIFFERED RADICALLY FROM MINE
3072-155948-0049 AFTERWARD I GREW TO KNOW HIM WELL BOTH WHILE I WAS GOVERNOR AND WHILE I WAS PRESIDENT AND MANY A TIME HE CAME ON AND BOXED WITH ME BATTLING NELSON WAS ANOTHER STANCH FRIEND AND HE AND I THINK ALIKE ON MOST QUESTIONS OF POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL LIFE
3072-155948-0050 I HAVE FOR A LONG TIME HAD THE FRIENDSHIP OF JOHN L SULLIVAN THAN WHOM IN HIS PRIME NO BETTER MAN EVER STEPPED INTO THE RING HE IS NOW A MASSACHUSETTS FARMER JOHN USED OCCASIONALLY TO VISIT ME AT THE WHITE HOUSE
3072-155948-0051 HIS ADVENT ALWAYS CAUSING A DISTINCT FLUTTER AMONG THE WAITING SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN WHEN I WENT TO AFRICA HE PRESENTED ME WITH A GOLD MOUNTED RABBIT'S FOOT FOR LUCK I CARRIED IT THROUGH MY AFRICAN TRIP AND I CERTAINLY HAD GOOD LUCK
3072-155948-0052 SAT DOWN OPPOSITE ME AND PUT A VERY EXPENSIVE CIGAR ON THE DESK SAYING HAVE A CIGAR I THANKED HIM AND SAID I DID NOT SMOKE TO WHICH HE RESPONDED PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET HE THEN ADDED TAKE ANOTHER PUT BOTH IN YOUR POCKET THIS I ACCORDINGLY DID
3072-155948-0053 HE WAS MY SISTER'S FAVORITE SON AND I ALWAYS TOOK A SPECIAL INTEREST IN HIM MYSELF I DID MY BEST TO BRING HIM UP THE WAY HE OUGHT TO GO BUT THERE WAS JUST NOTHING TO BE DONE WITH HIM HIS TASTES WERE NATURALLY LOW HE TOOK TO MUSIC
