1280-143268-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY SIX HOW THE DOCTOR FOUND A PATIENT READY TO HIS HAND WE WAITED FOR SOME MINUTES CROUCHED THERE AMONG THE BUSHES LISTENING TO THE COMING OF THOSE WHO FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE TREES
1280-143268-0001 WHILE MOMENT BY MOMENT THE MORNING LIGHT GREW CLEARER THE SMALL BIRDS TWITTERED AND THE PARROTS SCREAMED
1280-143268-0002 THE WOUNDED MAN UTTERED A LOW GROAN THAT THRILLED ME AND THEN SENT A COLD SHUDDER THROUGH MY VEINS FOR I WAS ALMOST TOUCHING HIM AND SET ASIDE THE FEELING OF HORROR AT HAVING BEEN AS IT WERE PARTNER IN INFLICTING HIS INJURY
1280-143268-0003 THERE WAS THE SENSATION THAT HE MIGHT RECOVER SUFFICIENTLY TO REVENGE HIMSELF UPON US BY A BLOW WITH HIS SPEAR THE SOUNDS CAME NEARER AND IT WAS NOW SO LIGHT THAT AS WE WATCHED WE COULD SEE THE BUSHES MOVING
1280-143268-0004 AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MORE OF THIS HORRIBLE BLOODSHED MUST ENSUE WE WERE CROUCHING CLOSE BUT THE WOUNDED MAN WAS MOANING AND HIS COMPANIONS MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT HEAR HIM AND THEN DISCOVERY MUST FOLLOW
1280-143268-0005 WHILE IF ON THE OTHER HAND WE DID NOT RESIST ALL HOPE OF RESCUING MY POOR FATHER WOULD BE GONE WE MUST FIGHT I SAID TO MYSELF SETTING MY TEETH HARD AND BRINGING MY GUN TO BEAR ON THE SPOT WHERE I COULD SEE SOMETHING MOVING
1280-143268-0006 AT THE SAME TIME I TRIED TO FIND WHERE JACK PENNY WAS HIDING BUT HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AT THE RISK OF BEING SEEN I ROSE UP A LITTLE SO AS TO TRY AND GET A GLIMPSE OF THE COMING ENEMY
1280-143268-0007 BUT THOUGH THE MOVEMENT AMONG THE BUSHES WAS PLAIN ENOUGH I ONLY CAUGHT ONE GLIMPSE OF A BLACK BODY AND HAD I BEEN DISPOSED TO SHOOT IT WAS TOO QUICK FOR ME AND WAS GONE IN AN INSTANT
1280-143268-0008 THEY WERE COMING NEARER AND IN AN AGONY OF EXCITEMENT I WAS THINKING OF ATTEMPTING TO BACK AWAY AND TRY TO REACH THE CAVE WHEN I FELT THAT I COULD NOT GET JACK PENNY AND THE BLACK TO ACT WITH ME UNLESS I SHOWED MYSELF
1280-143268-0009 AND THIS MEANT REVEALING OUR POSITION AND THERE ALL THE TIME WERE THE ENEMY STEADILY MAKING THEIR WAY RIGHT TOWARDS US WHAT SHALL I DO I SAID TO MYSELF AS I REALISED IN A SMALL WAY WHAT MUST BE THE FEELINGS OF A GENERAL WHO FINDS THAT THE BATTLE IS GOING AGAINST HIM
1280-143268-0010 I MUST CALL TO JACK PENNY COOEY RANG OUT JUST THEN FROM A LITTLE WAY TO MY RIGHT AND JIMMY LOOKED UP FROM HIS HIDING PLACE IS CARSTAIRS THERE CRIED THE FAMILIAR VOICE OF THE DOCTOR
1280-143268-0011 AND AS WITH BEATING HEART I SPRANG UP HE CAME STAGGERING WEARILY TOWARDS ME THROUGH THE CLINGING BUSHES MY DEAR BOY HE CRIED WITH HIS VOICE TREMBLING WHAT I HAVE SUFFERED ON YOUR ACCOUNT I THOUGHT YOU WERE A PRISONER
1280-143268-0012 NO I EXCLAIMED DELIGHTED AT THIS TURN IN OUR AFFAIRS JIMMY HELPED ME TO ESCAPE I SAY YOU DON'T THINK I RAN AWAY AND DESERTED YOU MY DEAR BOY HE CRIED I WAS AFRAID THAT YOU WOULD THINK THIS OF ME
1280-143268-0013 BUT THERE THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE SAFE AND THOUGH WE HAVE NOT RESCUED YOUR FATHER WE KNOW ENOUGH TO MAKE SUCCESS CERTAIN I'M AFRAID NOT I SAID HASTILY THE SAVAGES HAVE DISCOVERED OUR HIDING PLACE NO
1280-143268-0014 YES AND ONE OF THEM WAS APPROACHING IT JUST NOW WHEN JACK PENNY SHOT HIM DOWN THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE WHERE WHAT CLOSE HERE I HAD TAKEN HIS HAND TO LEAD HIM TO THE CLUMP OF BUSHES WHERE THE POOR WRETCH LAY
1280-143268-0015 AND ON PARTING THE BOUGHS AND TWIGS WE BOTH STARTED BACK IN HORROR MY BOY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE CRIED THE DOCTOR AS I STOOD SPEECHLESS THERE BY HIS SIDE WE HAVE NOT SO MANY FRIENDS THAT WE COULD AFFORD TO KILL THEM
1280-143268-0016 BUT ALREADY HE WAS BUSY FEELING THE FOLLY OF WASTING WORDS AND DOWN UPON HIS KNEES TO PLACE THE HEAD OF OUR FRIEND THE PRISONER OF THE SAVAGES IN A MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION BEFORE BEGINNING TO EXAMINE HIM FOR HIS WOUND
1280-143268-0017 BULLET RIGHT THROUGH THE SHOULDER SAID THE DOCTOR IN A SHORT ABRUPT MANNER AND AS HE SPOKE HE RAPIDLY TORE UP HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND PLUGGED AND BOUND THE WOUND SUPPLEMENTING THE HANDKERCHIEF WITH A LONG SCARF WHICH HE WORE ROUND THE WAIST
1280-143268-0018 JIMMY HELP ME CARRY HIM TO THE CAVE JIMMY CARRY UM ALL LONG RIGHT WAY PUT UM ON JIMMY'S BACK CRIED MY BLACK COMPANION AND THIS SEEMING TO BE NO BAD WAY OF CARRYING THE WOUNDED MAN IN SUCH A TIME OF EMERGENCY
1280-143268-0019 JIMMY STOOPED DOWN EXASPERATING ME THE WHILE BY GRINNING AS IF IT WAS GOOD FUN TILL THE SUFFERER FROM OUR MISTAKE WAS PLACED UPON HIS BACK WHEN HE EXCLAIMED LOT MUCH HEAVY HEAVY TWICE TWO SHEEP HEAVY
1280-143268-0020 CLEAR DE BUSH WE HASTILY DREW THE BOUGHS ASIDE AND JIMMY STEADILY DESCENDED THE STEEP SLOPE ENTERED THE RIVULET CROSSED AND THEN STOPPED FOR A MOMENT BENEATH THE OVERHANGING BOUGHS BEFORE CLIMBING TO THE CABIN
1280-143268-0021 HERE LET ME HELP YOU SAID THE DOCTOR HOLDING OUT HIS HAND YES SAID JIMMY DRAWING HIS WADDY AND BOOMERANG FROM HIS BELT HOLD UM TIGHT UM ALL IN BLACK FELLOW WAY
1280-143268-0022 THEN SEIZING THE BOUGHS HE BALANCED THE WOUNDED MAN CAREFULLY AND DREW HIMSELF STEADILY UP STEP BY STEP EXHIBITING WONDERFUL STRENGTH OF MUSCLE TILL HE HAD CLIMBED TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE
1280-143268-0023 WHERE HE BENT DOWN AND CRAWLED IN ON HANDS AND KNEES WAITING TILL HIS BURDEN WAS REMOVED FROM HIS BACK AND THEN GETTING UP ONCE MORE TO LOOK ROUND SMILING JIMMY CARRY LOT O MEN LIKE THAT WAY
1280-143268-0024 AND HERE THE DOCTOR SET HIMSELF TO WORK TO MORE SECURELY BANDAGE HIS PATIENT'S SHOULDER JACK PENNY LOOKING ON RESTING UPON HIS GUN AND WEARING A COUNTENANCE FULL OF MISERY THERE SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD FINISHED

1280-143268-0028 I WON'T FIRE IT OFF AGAIN I WAS VERY NEARLY MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE I SAID OUT OF COMPASSION FOR JACK PENNY HE SEEMED SO MUCH DISTRESSED
1280-143268-0029 THEN I'M GLAD YOU DID NOT FIRE HE SAID THERE KEEP YOUR PIECE PENNY WE MAY WANT ITS HELP
1280-143268-0030 BUT I DON'T THINK ANY EVIL WILL RESULT FROM IT HIST HE IS COMING TO OUR CONVERSATION HAD BEEN CARRIED ON IN A WHISPER AND WE NOW STOPPED SHORT AND WATCHED THE DOCTOR'S PATIENT IN THE DIM TWILIGHT OF THE CAVERN
1280-143268-0031 AS HE UNCLOSED HIS EYES AND STARED FIRST UP AT THE CEILING AND THEN ABOUT HIM TILL HIS EYES RESTED UPON US WHEN HE SMILED AM I MUCH HURT HE SAID IN A LOW CALM VOICE OH NO SAID THE DOCTOR
1280-143268-0032 A BULLET WOUND NOT A DANGEROUS ONE AT ALL TO MY ASTONISHMENT HE WENT ON TALKING QUITE CALMLY AND WITHOUT ANY OF THE DAZED LOOK AND THE STRANGE HABIT OF FORGETTING HIS OWN TONGUE TO CONTINUE IN THAT OF THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM HE HAD BEEN A PRISONER FOR SO LONG
1280-143268-0033 I THOUGHT I SHOULD FIND YOU HERE HE SAID AND I CAME ON THINKING THAT PERHAPS I COULD HELP YOU HELP US YES OF COURSE YOU CAN YOU SHALL HELP US TO GET MISTER CARSTAIRS AWAY

1280-143268-0035 I EXCHANGED GLANCES WITH THE DOCTOR WHO SIGNED TO ME TO BE SILENT IT WAS A VERY HARD ONE VERY HARD THE WOUNDED MAN CONTINUED AND THEN HE STOPPED SHORT
1280-143268-0036 LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM AT THE FOREST SEEN THROUGH THE OPENING OF THE CAVE BY DEGREES HIS EYELIDS DROPPED WERE RAISED AGAIN AND THEN FELL AND HE SEEMED TO GLIDE INTO A HEAVY SLEEP
1280-143268-0037 THE DOCTOR MOTIONED US TO KEEP AWAY AND WE ALL WENT TO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK OVER THE NIGHT'S ADVENTURE THE CONVERSATION CHANGING AT TIMES TO A DISCUSSION OF OUR FRIEND'S MENTAL AFFECTION
1280-143268-0038 THE SHOCK OF THE WOUND HAS AFFECTED HIS HEAD BENEFICIALLY IT SEEMS THE DOCTOR SAID AT LAST WHETHER IT WILL LAST I CANNOT SAY
1280-143268-0039 AT LEAST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOCTOR WAS SAYING THOSE OR SIMILAR WORDS FROM OUT OF A MIST AND THEN ALL WAS SILENT
