6701-71401-0000 BRIEFLY PUT DOCTOR THE CASE IS THIS SAID ADAM ADAMS
6701-71401-0001 IF HE SHOULD BREATHE OF IT A POWDER STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL A PERSON
6701-71401-0002 WHEN IT WOULD MAKE THAT PERSON SICK AND GIVE HIM CRAMPS PERHAPS AND KILL HIM YES THE OLD DOCTOR RUBBED HIS HANDS IN THOUGHT THAT IS A SUBJECT FOR SPECULATION
6701-71401-0003 CERTAIN CYANIDE COMPOUNDS MIGHT BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DO SO UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS ANY REAL DRY POWDER WOULD CHOKE A PERSON IF HE GOT A BIG DOSE OF IT I HEARD OF A BOY WHO CAME NEAR DYING AS THE RESULT OF BREATHING IN A QUANTITY OF EXTRA DRY LICORICE POWDER
6701-71401-0004 SOMETHING TRULY DANGEROUS BUT I KNOW OF NOTHING BUT HOLD THE DOCTOR CLAPPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER YES YES THAT WOULD DO IT THAT AND THAT ONLY WHAT I HAD A SAMPLE OF IT GIVEN TO ME SOME SIX MONTHS AGO
6701-71401-0005 A RARE GROWTH FOUND ONLY IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY BY MANY CHINAMEN
6701-71401-0006 AND WHENEVER THEY COME NEAR ONE THEY UTTER A PRAYER FOR DELIVERANCE FROM ITS EVILS IF YOU SLEEP NEAR THE YAMLANG BUSH IT WILL MAKE YOU VERY SICK AND THAT POWDER
6701-71401-0007 BUT ON CONTACT WITH THE AIR QUICKLY CHANGED TO BROWNISH WHITE AND LOST ITSELF IT WAS SO FINE EVAPORATED YOU CAN CALL IT THAT IF YOU WISH IT WAS INTENSE I HELD IT AT ARMS LENGTH YET IT MADE ME SICK AND I HAD CRAMPS FOR OVER AN HOUR AFTERWARDS
6701-71401-0008 IT WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU IF YOU HAD PLACED IT TO YOUR MOUTH OR NOSE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT OF IT MAY I ASK WHERE YOU GOT THE STUFF IT WAS IMPORTED INTO THIS COUNTRY BY A DRUG FIRM MERELY AS A CURIOSITY THEY PUT IT UP IN TINY VIALS
6701-71401-0009 AND I GAVE THEM NO CREDIT FOR DOING IT WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE FIRM I WOULD NOT TELL EVERYBODY BUT I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU TO KEEP A SECRET THE FIRM WAS ALEXANDER AND COMPANY OF ROCHESTER
6701-71401-0010 WHO STAND VERY HIGH IN THE TRADE I BUY MANY THINGS FROM THEM FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEIR TRAVELING MAN A MISTER OSTRELLO GAVE ME THE POWDER WHEN HE CALLED HE TOLD ME HOW THE FIRM HAD EXPERIMENTED ON A DOG AND AN OX
6701-71401-0011 BOTH DIED IN LESS THAN TWO MINUTES AND EACH WITH CRAMPS BUT AFTER DEATH NEITHER ANIMAL SHOWED THE LEAST TRACE OF THE POISON WASN'T THIS OSTRELLO AFRAID TO HANDLE THE STUFF
6701-71401-0012 HE SAID HE WAS A BIT USED TO IT I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T WANT TO GET USED TO IT
6701-71401-0013 NO I PREFER TO SMOKE THANKS JUST THE SAME I AM INTERESTED IN THIS YAMLANG AS YOU CALL IT WHERE CAN I GET THE STUFF NO MORE OF IT CAN BE HAD I RATHER THINK THEY GOT AFRAID OF IT WAIT I'LL GET THE VIAL IT WAS IN
6701-71401-0014 PERHAPS THERE IS A WHIFF LEFT IN IT THANKS BUT DO YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE QUERIED THE DETECTIVE AND GAVE A LAUGH WHEN THE EMPTY VIAL WAS PRODUCED HE OPENED IT AND TOOK A SHORT SNIFF THEN HE DREW HIS BREATH IN SHARPLY
6701-71401-0015 A FAINT ODOR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE SAME ODOR HE HAD DETECTED IN THE CARPET ON THE UPPER HALLWAY OF THE LANGMORE MANSION
6701-71401-0016 YES BUT NOT VERY WELL I DON'T THINK IT WILL AFFECT ME MUCH I TRUST NOT MY DEAR ADAMS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE YOU NOW WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT ANOTHER CASE THAT'S ALL I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT JUST YET
