5620-40470-0000 FOR ALL OTHER RAPIDS OF THE ROUTE THE GALLOP RAPIDS THE SPLIT ROCK RAPIDS THE CASCADES AND THE REST THERE ARE PILOTS IN PLENTY BUT NOT FOR THOSE OF LACHINE AND TO USE THE SAME SIMILE AGAIN
5620-40470-0001 I SAW THAT THE SHOOTING OF THESE LACHINE RAPIDS IS LIKE THE TAMING OF A PARTICULARLY FIERCE LION IT IS A BUSINESS BY ITSELF THAT FEW MEN CARE TO UNDERTAKE SO IT CAME THAT I SOUGHT OUT ONE OF THESE FEW
5620-40470-0002 THIS UNSOUGHT NOTORIETY HAS MADE HIM SHY HE DOES NOT LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HIS WORK OR TELL YOU HOW IT FEELS TO DO THIS THING
5620-40470-0003 YET CERTAIN FACTS HE VOUCHSAFED WHEN I WENT TO HIS HOME THAT HELP ONE TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PILOT'S LIFE HE EMPHASIZED THIS FOR INSTANCE AS ESSENTIAL IN A MAN WHO WOULD FACE THAT FURY OF WATERS HE MUST NOT BE AFRAID
5620-40470-0004 BETRAY HIM THE RAPIDS WILL HAVE NO MERCY
5620-40470-0005 IF LEFT ALONE EVERY DANGER THEY CAN OVERCOME BUT THE ONE THAT LIES IN THEMSELVES THEY CANNOT BRAVE THEIR OWN FEAR
5620-40470-0006 AND ALWAYS HE POSTPONED BEGINNING AND WITH ONE EXCUSE OR ANOTHER TOOK HIS BOATS THROUGH THE LACHINE CANAL A SAFE BUT TAME SHORT CUT NOT LIKELY TO DRAW TOURISTS
5620-40470-0007 NOW NEVAIR HE CAN LEARN HEEM RIGHT WHY HOW SHOULD HE HAVE STARTED HIM I ASKED
5620-40470-0008 AND THEN IN HIS JERKY CANADIAN SPEECH HE EXPLAINED HOW THIS WAS
5620-40470-0009 AND IT WAS HIP BAS HIP BAS
5620-40470-0010 BUT HIS FATHER WOULD LOOK AT HIM AND SAY DO YOU KNOW THE RIVER MY SON ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW THE RIVER AND FRED WOULD ANSWER FATHER I THINK I DO
5620-40470-0011 SO IT WENT ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND OUILLETTE WAS ALMOST DESPAIRING OF A CHANCE TO SHOW HIMSELF WORTHY OF HIS FATHER'S TEACHING WHEN SUDDENLY THE CHANCE CAME IN A WAY NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN
5620-40470-0012 BESIDES THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY THEY WERE CARRYING A HEAVY LOAD AND THE WIND WAS SOUTHEAST BLOWING HARD THE VERY WIND TO MAKE TROUBLE AT THE BAD PLACES
5620-40470-0013 MY SON DO YOU KNOW THE RIVER AND FRED ANSWERED AS USUAL WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OF WHAT WAS COMING NEXT FATHER I THINK I DO
5620-40470-0014 THEN TAKE HER THROUGH SAID THE OLD MAN STEPPING BACK THERE IS THE WHEEL MY FADDER
5620-40470-0015 AT THE WHEEL HE STOOD AND WITH A TOUCH OF HIS FATHER'S HAND NOW AND THEN TO HELP HIM HE BROUGHT THE BOAT DOWN SAFELY
5620-40470-0016 HIS IDEA WAS THAT COULD HE ONCE MAKE HIS SON FACE THE WORST OF THIS BUSINESS AND COME OUT UNHARMED THEN NEVER WOULD THE BOY KNOW FEAR AGAIN FOR ALL THE REST WOULD BE EASIER THAN WHAT HE HAD ALREADY DONE
5620-40470-0017 HAVE YOU LOST ANY LIVES I ASKED REACHING OUT FOR THRILLING STORIES NEVAIR SAID HE EVER COME NEAR IT
5620-40470-0018 AND ONCE THE STARBOARD RUDDER CHAIN BROKE THIS LAST WAS ALL BUT A DISASTER FOR THEY WERE DOWN SO FAR THAT THE RIVER MUST SURELY HAVE CONQUERED THE ENGINES HAD THEY TRIED TO HEAD UP STREAM
5620-40470-0019 AND PUTTING THE WHEEL HARD APORT FOR THE PORT CHAIN HELD HE RAN HER ON THE ROCKS
5620-40470-0020 MADE IT QUITE CLEAR WHAT THEY WERE GOOD FOR PUT OFF SWIFTLY IN THEIR LITTLE BARKS STRAIGHT INTO THAT REELING FLOOD STRAIGHT OUT TO THE HELPLESS BOAT THEN BACK TO SHORE EACH BEARING TWO OR THREE OF THE FEAR STRUCK COMPANY
5620-40470-0021 THINK OF THAT HOUR AFTER HOUR WITH PADDLES ALONE THESE DAUNTLESS SONS OF IROQUOIS BRAVES FOUGHT THE RAPIDS TRIUMPHED OVER THE RAPIDS AND BROUGHT TO LAND THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE RAGE OF WATERS
5620-40470-0022 AT THIS VERY PLACE WHERE NOW THEY WERE ABOUT TO OVERTAKE HIM
