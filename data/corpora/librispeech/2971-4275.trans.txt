2971-4275-0000 THE FLYING SHIP OF PROFESSOR LUCIFER SANG THROUGH THE SKIES LIKE A SILVER ARROW THE BLEAK WHITE STEEL OF IT GLEAMING IN THE BLEAK BLUE EMPTINESS OF THE EVENING
2971-4275-0001 TO THE TWO MEN IN IT IT SEEMED TO BE FAR ABOVE THE STARS THE PROFESSOR HAD HIMSELF INVENTED THE FLYING MACHINE AND HAD ALSO INVENTED NEARLY EVERYTHING IN IT EVERY SORT OF TOOL OR APPARATUS HAD IN CONSEQUENCE
2971-4275-0002 TO THE FULL THAT FANTASTIC AND DISTORTED LOOK WHICH BELONGS TO THE MIRACLES OF SCIENCE FOR THE WORLD OF SCIENCE AND EVOLUTION IS FAR MORE NAMELESS AND ELUSIVE AND LIKE A DREAM
2971-4275-0003 SINCE IN THE LATTER IMAGES AND IDEAS REMAIN THEMSELVES ETERNALLY WHILE IT IS THE WHOLE IDEA OF EVOLUTION THAT IDENTITIES MELT INTO EACH OTHER AS THEY DO IN A NIGHTMARE
2971-4275-0004 ALL THE TOOLS OF PROFESSOR LUCIFER WERE THE ANCIENT HUMAN TOOLS GONE MAD GROWN INTO UNRECOGNIZABLE SHAPES FORGETFUL OF THEIR ORIGIN FORGETFUL OF THEIR NAMES THAT THING WHICH LOOKED LIKE AN ENORMOUS KEY
2971-4275-0005 WITH THREE WHEELS WAS REALLY A PATENT AND VERY DEADLY REVOLVER THAT OBJECT WHICH SEEMED TO BE CREATED BY THE ENTANGLEMENT OF TWO CORKSCREWS WAS REALLY THE KEY THE THING WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A TRICYCLE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
2971-4275-0006 ALL THESE THINGS AS I SAY THE PROFESSOR HAD INVENTED HE HAD INVENTED EVERYTHING IN THE FLYING SHIP WITH THE EXCEPTION PERHAPS OF HIMSELF THIS HE HAD BEEN BORN TOO LATE ACTUALLY TO INAUGURATE BUT HE BELIEVED AT LEAST
2971-4275-0007 THE PROFESSOR HAD NOT INVENTED AND HIM HE HAD NOT EVEN VERY GREATLY IMPROVED THOUGH HE HAD FISHED HIM UP WITH A LASSO OUT OF HIS OWN BACK GARDEN IN WESTERN BULGARIA WITH THE PURE OBJECT OF IMPROVING HIM
2971-4275-0008 HE WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY HOLY MAN ALMOST ENTIRELY COVERED WITH WHITE HAIR
2971-4275-0009 A MONK OF IMMENSE LEARNING AND ACUTE INTELLECT HE HAD MADE HIMSELF HAPPY IN A LITTLE STONE HUT
2971-4275-0010 CHIEFLY BY WRITING THE MOST CRUSHING REFUTATIONS OF EXPOSURES OF CERTAIN HERESIES THE LAST PROFESSORS OF WHICH HAD BEEN BURNT GENERALLY BY EACH OTHER PRECISELY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY
2971-4275-0011 IN THE SOCIETY OF WILD ANIMALS AND NOW THAT HIS LUCK HAD LIFTED HIM ABOVE ALL THE MOUNTAINS IN THE SOCIETY OF A WILD PHYSICIST HE MADE HIMSELF HAPPY STILL I HAVE NO INTENTION MY GOOD MICHAEL SAID PROFESSOR LUCIFER
2971-4275-0012 RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH MEN OF ALL KINDS YOU WILL FORGIVE ME SAID THE MONK MEEKLY FROM UNDER LOADS OF WHITE BEARD BUT I FEAR I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WAS IT IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT RUB MY SHOULDER AGAINST MEN OF ALL KINDS
2971-4275-0013 YOU KNOW BETTER PHRASE IT HOW YOU LIKE TWIST IT HOW YOU LIKE YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW BETTER YOU KNOW WHAT ARE A MAN'S REAL FEELINGS ABOUT THE HEAVENS WHEN HE FINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN THE HEAVENS SURROUNDED BY THE HEAVENS
2971-4275-0014 THE HEAVENS ARE EVIL THE SKY IS EVIL THE STARS ARE EVIL THIS MERE SPACE THIS MERE QUANTITY TERRIFIES A MAN MORE THAN TIGERS OR THE TERRIBLE PLAGUE YOU KNOW THAT SINCE OUR SCIENCE HAS SPOKEN
2971-4275-0015 THE BOTTOM HAS FALLEN OUT OF THE UNIVERSE NOW HEAVEN IS THE HOPELESS THING MORE HOPELESS THAN ANY HELL NOW
2971-4275-0016 OF MORBID APES IT MUST BE IN THE EARTH UNDERNEATH YOU UNDER THE ROOTS OF THE GRASS IN THE PLACE WHERE HELL WAS OF OLD THE FIERY CRYPTS THE LURID CELLARS OF THE UNDERWORLD TO WHICH YOU ONCE CONDEMNED THE WICKED
2971-4275-0017 RADIANTLY I REALLY LIKE TO DRAW OUT YOUR SIMPLE IDEAS WELL THE FACT IS SAID THE OTHER THAT MUCH AS I ADMIRE YOUR RHETORIC AND THE RHETORIC OF YOUR SCHOOL FROM A PURELY VERBAL POINT OF VIEW SUCH LITTLE STUDY OF YOU
2971-4275-0018 AND YOUR SCHOOL IN HUMAN HISTORY AS I HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO MAKE HAS LED ME TO ER RATHER SINGULAR CONCLUSION
2971-4275-0019 ESPECIALLY IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE COME COME SAID THE PROFESSOR ENCOURAGINGLY I'LL HELP YOU OUT HOW DID MY VIEW STRIKE YOU WELL THE TRUTH IS I KNOW I DON'T EXPRESS IT PROPERLY BUT SOMEHOW IT SEEMED TO ME
2971-4275-0020 THAT YOU ALWAYS CONVEY IDEAS OF THAT KIND WITH MOST ELOQUENCE WHEN ER WHEN OH GET ON CRIED LUCIFER BOISTEROUSLY WELL IN POINT OF FACT WHEN YOUR FLYING SHIP IS JUST GOING TO RUN INTO SOMETHING
2971-4275-0021 I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND MY MENTIONING IT BUT IT'S RUNNING INTO SOMETHING NOW LUCIFER EXPLODED WITH AN OATH AND LEAPT ERECT LEANING HARD UPON THE HANDLE
2971-4275-0022 THEY HAD BEEN SHOOTING DOWNWARDS INTO GREAT CRACKS AND CAVERNS OF CLOUD NOW THROUGH A SORT OF PURPLE HAZE COULD BE SEEN COMPARATIVELY NEAR TO THEM WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE UPPER PART OF A HUGE DARK ORB OR SPHERE
2971-4275-0023 ISLANDED IN A SEA OF CLOUD THE PROFESSOR'S EYES WERE BLAZING LIKE A MANIAC'S
2971-4275-0024 WE WILL HAVE NO GODS HERE MAN SHALL BE AS INNOCENT AS THE DAISIES AS INNOCENT AND AS CRUEL HERE THE INTELLECT THERE SEEMS SAID MICHAEL TIMIDLY TO BE SOMETHING STICKING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
2971-4275-0025 SO THERE IS SAID THE PROFESSOR LEANING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP HIS SPECTACLES SHINING WITH INTELLECTUAL EXCITEMENT WHAT CAN IT BE IT MIGHT OF COURSE BE MERELY A THEN A SHRIEK INDESCRIBABLE
2971-4275-0026 BROKE OUT OF HIM OF A SUDDEN AND HE FLUNG UP HIS ARMS LIKE A LOST SPIRIT THE MONK TOOK THE HELM IN A TIRED WAY HE DID NOT SEEM MUCH ASTONISHED FOR HE CAME FROM AN IGNORANT PART OF THE WORLD
2971-4275-0027 IN WHICH IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR LOST SPIRITS TO SHRIEK WHEN THEY SEE THE CURIOUS SHAPE WHICH THE PROFESSOR
2971-4275-0028 FOR A MOMENT THEIR EYES AND NOSTRILS WERE STOPPED WITH DARKNESS AND OPAQUE CLOUD THEN THE DARKNESS WARMED INTO A KIND OF BROWN FOG AND FAR FAR BELOW THEM THE BROWN FOG FELL UNTIL IT WARMED INTO FIRE
2971-4275-0029 THROUGH THE DENSE LONDON ATMOSPHERE THEY COULD SEE BELOW THEM THE FLAMING LONDON LIGHTS LIGHTS WHICH LAY BENEATH THEM IN SQUARES AND OBLONGS OF FIRE THE FOG AND FIRE WERE MIXED IN A PASSIONATE VAPOUR
2971-4275-0030 YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THE FOG WAS DROWNING THE FLAMES OR YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THE FLAMES HAD SET THE FOG ON FIRE BESIDE THE SHIP AND BENEATH IT FOR IT SWUNG JUST UNDER THE BALL
2971-4275-0031 BEWILDERINGLY ON EVERY SIDE A MONSTROSITY IN THAT STARLESS HEAVEN
2971-4275-0032 THEY WERE SO NEAR TO THE BALL THAT LUCIFER LEANED HIS HAND AGAINST IT HOLDING THE VESSEL AWAY
2971-4275-0033 ABOVE IT THE CROSS ALREADY DRAPED IN THE DARK MISTS OF THE BORDERLAND WAS SHADOWY AND MORE AWFUL IN SHAPE AND SIZE PROFESSOR LUCIFER SLAPPED HIS HAND TWICE UPON THE SURFACE OF THE GREAT ORB
2971-4275-0034 HIS ARMS IN STARK WEARINESS AND HE POINTED UP TO THE CROSS HIS FACE DARK WITH A GRIN I WAS TELLING YOU JUST NOW MICHAEL THAT I CAN PROVE THE BEST PART OF THE RATIONALIST CASE
2971-4275-0035 THE CROSS IS ARBITRARY ABOVE ALL THE GLOBE IS AT UNITY WITH ITSELF THE CROSS IS PRIMARILY AND ABOVE ALL THINGS AT ENMITY WITH ITSELF THE CROSS IS THE CONFLICT OF TWO HOSTILE LINES
2971-4275-0036 WHAT YOU SAY IS PERFECTLY TRUE SAID MICHAEL WITH SERENITY BUT WE LIKE CONTRADICTIONS IN TERMS MAN IS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS HE IS A BEAST WHOSE SUPERIORITY TO OTHER BEASTS CONSISTS IN HAVING FALLEN
2971-4275-0037 AN ETERNAL COLLISION SO AM I THAT IS A STRUGGLE IN STONE EVERY FORM OF LIFE IS A STRUGGLE IN FLESH THE SHAPE OF THE CROSS IS IRRATIONAL JUST AS THE SHAPE OF THE HUMAN ANIMAL IS IRRATIONAL
2971-4275-0038 REPRESENTED BY THAT CROSS HAS A NECESSARY PLACE AT A CERTAIN EVOLUTIONARY STAGE BUT SURELY THE CROSS IS THE LOWER DEVELOPMENT AND THE SPHERE THE HIGHER AFTER ALL IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO SEE
2971-4275-0039 WHAT IS REALLY WRONG WITH WREN'S ARCHITECTURAL ARRANGEMENT AND WHAT IS THAT PRAY INQUIRED MICHAEL MEEKLY THE CROSS IS ON TOP OF THE BALL SAID PROFESSOR LUCIFER SIMPLY THAT IS SURELY WRONG
2971-4275-0040 THE BALL SHOULD BE ON TOP OF THE CROSS THE CROSS IS A MERE BARBARIC PROP THE BALL IS PERFECTION THE CROSS AT ITS BEST
2971-4275-0041 THE BALL IS THE ROUNDED THE RIPE AND FINAL FRUIT AND THE FRUIT SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF THE TREE NOT AT THE BOTTOM OF IT OH SAID THE MONK A WRINKLE COMING INTO HIS FOREHEAD SO
2971-4275-0042 BECAUSE I THINK IN THAT CASE YOU WOULD SEE A MOST SINGULAR EFFECT AN EFFECT THAT HAS GENERALLY BEEN ACHIEVED BY ALL THOSE ABLE AND POWERFUL SYSTEMS WHICH RATIONALISM
2971-4275-0043 HAS PRODUCED TO LEAD OR TEACH MANKIND YOU WOULD SEE I THINK
2971-4275-0044 AND LOGICAL OUTCOME OF YOUR LOGICAL SCHEME WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ASKED LUCIFER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN I MEAN IT WOULD FALL DOWN SAID THE MONK LOOKING WISTFULLY INTO THE VOID
2971-4275-0045 LUCIFER MADE AN ANGRY MOVEMENT AND OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK BUT MICHAEL WITH ALL HIS AIR OF DELIBERATION WAS PROCEEDING BEFORE HE COULD BRING OUT A WORD I ONCE KNEW A MAN LIKE YOU LUCIFER
2971-4275-0046 HE SAID WITH A MADDENING MONOTONY AND SLOWNESS OF ARTICULATION HE TOOK THIS THERE IS NO MAN LIKE ME CRIED LUCIFER WITH A VIOLENCE THAT SHOOK THE SHIP AS I WAS OBSERVING CONTINUED MICHAEL THIS MAN ALSO TOOK THE VIEW
2971-4275-0047 THAT THE SYMBOL OF CHRISTIANITY WAS A SYMBOL OF SAVAGERY AND ALL UNREASON HIS HISTORY IS RATHER AMUSING IT IS ALSO A PERFECT ALLEGORY OF WHAT HAPPENS TO RATIONALISTS LIKE YOURSELF
2971-4275-0048 HE BEGAN OF COURSE BY REFUSING TO ALLOW A CRUCIFIX IN HIS HOUSE OR ROUND HIS WIFE'S NECK OR EVEN IN A PICTURE HE SAID AS YOU SAY THAT IT WAS AN ARBITRARY AND FANTASTIC SHAPE
2971-4275-0049 LOVED BECAUSE IT WAS PARADOXICAL THEN HE BEGAN TO GROW FIERCER AND MORE ECCENTRIC HE WOULD BATTER THE CROSSES
2971-4275-0050 HE WAS STANDING SMOKING FOR A MOMENT
2971-4275-0051 OF AN INTERMINABLE LINE OF PALINGS WHEN HIS EYES WERE OPENED NOT A LIGHT SHIFTED NOT A LEAF STIRRED
2971-4275-0052 HE BROKE IT DOWN AND TORE IT UP FOR HE HATED THE CROSS AND EVERY PALING IS A WALL OF CROSSES WHEN HE RETURNED TO HIS HOUSE HE WAS A LITERAL MADMAN HE SAT UPON A CHAIR
2971-4275-0053 HE BROKE HIS FURNITURE BECAUSE IT WAS MADE OF CROSSES HE BURNT HIS HOUSE BECAUSE IT WAS MADE OF CROSSES HE WAS FOUND IN THE RIVER LUCIFER WAS LOOKING AT HIM
2971-4275-0054 WITH A BITTEN LIP IS THAT STORY REALLY TRUE HE ASKED OH NO SAID MICHAEL AIRILY IT IS A PARABLE IT IS A PARABLE OF YOU AND ALL YOUR RATIONALISTS YOU BEGIN
2971-4275-0055 WHEN WE MEET YOU AGAIN YOU ARE SAYING THAT NO ONE HAS ANY WILL TO JOIN IT WITH WE LEAVE YOU
2971-4275-0056 WE FIND YOU SAYING THAT THERE IS NO SUCH PLACE AS IRELAND YOU START BY HATING THE IRRATIONAL AND YOU COME TO HATE EVERYTHING
2971-4275-0057 AND SO LUCIFER LEAPT UPON HIM WITH A CRY LIKE A WILD BEAST'S AH HE SCREAMED TO EVERY MAN HIS MADNESS YOU ARE MAD ON THE CROSS LET IT SAVE YOU AND WITH A HERCULEAN ENERGY
2971-4275-0058 AT THE SAME INSTANT LUCIFER DROVE DOWN A LEVER AND THE SHIP SHOT UP WITH HIM IN IT ALONE HA HA HE YELLED WHAT SORT OF A SUPPORT DO YOU FIND IT OLD FELLOW
2971-4275-0059 FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES OF SUPPORT REPLIED MICHAEL GRIMLY IT IS AT ANY RATE A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN THE BALL MAY I ASK IF YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE ME HERE YES YES I MOUNT I MOUNT
2971-4275-0060 MY PATH IS UPWARD HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU TOLD ME PROFESSOR THAT THERE IS REALLY NO UP OR DOWN IN SPACE SAID THE MONK I SHALL MOUNT UP AS MUCH AS YOU WILL INDEED SAID LUCIFER
2971-4275-0061 THE DECADENT COMEDY LIFE IS MUCH TOO IMPORTANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY THOSE WHO LOOK AT THE MATTER A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY OR DELICATELY SEE THAT PARADOX IS A THING WHICH ESPECIALLY BELONGS TO ALL RELIGIONS PARADOX
2971-4275-0062 OF THIS KIND IS TO BE FOUND IN SUCH A SAYING AS THE MEEK SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH BUT THOSE WHO SEE AND FEEL THE FUNDAMENTAL FACT OF THE MATTER KNOW THAT PARADOX IS A THING WHICH BELONGS NOT TO RELIGION ONLY
2971-4275-0063 FATHER MICHAEL IN SPITE OF HIS YEARS AND IN SPITE OF HIS ASCETICISM OR BECAUSE OF IT FOR ALL I KNOW WAS A VERY HEALTHY AND HAPPY OLD GENTLEMAN
2971-4275-0064 THE DEATHLESS AND HOPELESS CONTRADICTION WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE MERE IDEA OF COURAGE HE WAS A HAPPY AND HEALTHY OLD GENTLEMAN AND THEREFORE HE WAS QUITE CARELESS ABOUT IT AND HE FELT AS EVERY MAN FEELS
2971-4275-0065 THAT THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN MADE TO MEAN THAT WHOEVER LOST HIS PHYSICAL LIFE SHOULD SAVE HIS SPIRITUAL LIFE NOW HE KNEW THE TRUTH THAT IS KNOWN TO ALL FIGHTERS AND HUNTERS AND CLIMBERS OF CLIFFS
2971-4275-0066 SHOULD THINK ABOUT PHILOSOPHICAL INCONSISTENCIES BUT SUCH EXTREME STATES ARE DANGEROUS THINGS TO DOGMATIZE ABOUT FREQUENTLY THEY PRODUCE A CERTAIN USELESS AND JOYLESS ACTIVITY OF THE MERE INTELLECT
2971-4275-0067 BUT EVEN FROM DESIRE AND IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOGMATIZE ABOUT SUCH STATES IT IS STILL MORE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THEM TO THIS SPASM OF SANITY AND CLARITY IN MICHAEL'S MIND SUCCEEDED A SPASM
2971-4275-0068 AT THE HIGHEST CRISIS OF SOME INCURABLE ANGUISH THERE WILL SUDDENLY FALL UPON THE MAN THE STILLNESS OF AN INSANE CONTENTMENT IT IS NOT HOPE FOR HOPE IS BROKEN AND ROMANTIC AND CONCERNED
2971-4275-0069 AND AS IT WERE AT ONCE DOUBTFUL AND DEFIANT BUT THIS IS SIMPLY A SATISFACTION IT IS NOT KNOWLEDGE FOR THE INTELLECT SEEMS TO HAVE NO PARTICULAR PART IN IT NOR IS IT AS THE MODERN IDIOTS
2971-4275-0070 WOULD CERTAINLY SAY IT IS A MERE NUMBNESS OR NEGATIVE PARALYSIS OF THE POWERS OF GRIEF IT IS NOT NEGATIVE IN THE LEAST IT IS AS POSITIVE AS GOOD NEWS IN SOME SENSE INDEED IT IS GOOD NEWS
2971-4275-0071 IT SEEMS ALMOST AS IF THERE WERE SOME EQUALITY AMONG THINGS SOME BALANCE IN ALL POSSIBLE CONTINGENCIES WHICH WE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO KNOW LEST WE SHOULD LEARN INDIFFERENCE TO GOOD AND EVIL BUT WHICH IS SOMETIMES SHOWN TO US FOR AN INSTANT
2971-4275-0072 AS A LAST AID IN OUR LAST AGONY MICHAEL CERTAINLY COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ANY SORT OF RATIONAL ACCOUNT OF THIS VAST UNMEANING SATISFACTION WHICH SOAKED THROUGH HIM AND FILLED HIM TO THE BRIM
2971-4275-0073 HE FELT WITH A SORT OF HALF WITTED LUCIDITY THAT THE CROSS WAS THERE AND THE BALL WAS THERE AND THE DOME WAS THERE THAT HE WAS GOING TO CLIMB DOWN FROM THEM AND THAT HE DID NOT MIND IN THE LEAST WHETHER HE WAS KILLED OR NOT
2971-4275-0074 THIS MYSTERIOUS MOOD LASTED LONG ENOUGH TO START HIM ON HIS DREADFUL DESCENT AND TO FORCE HIM TO CONTINUE IT BUT SIX TIMES BEFORE HE REACHED
2971-4275-0075 TERROR HAD RETURNED ON HIM LIKE A FLYING STORM OF DARKNESS AND THUNDER BY THE TIME HE HAD REACHED THAT PLACE OF SAFETY HE ALMOST FELT AS IN SOME IMPOSSIBLE FIT OF DRUNKENNESS THAT HE HAD TWO HEADS
2971-4275-0076 ONE WAS CALM CARELESS AND EFFICIENT THE OTHER SAW THE DANGER LIKE A DEADLY MAP WAS WISE CAREFUL AND USELESS HE HAD FANCIED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO LET HIMSELF VERTICALLY DOWN THE FACE OF THE WHOLE BUILDING
2971-4275-0077 WHEN HE DROPPED INTO THE UPPER GALLERY HE STILL FELT AS FAR FROM THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE AS IF HE HAD ONLY DROPPED FROM THE SUN TO THE MOON HE PAUSED A LITTLE PANTING IN THE GALLERY UNDER THE BALL
2971-4275-0078 AND IDLY KICKED HIS HEELS MOVING A FEW YARDS ALONG IT AND AS HE DID SO A THUNDERBOLT STRUCK HIS SOUL A MAN A HEAVY ORDINARY MAN WITH A COMPOSED INDIFFERENT FACE
2971-4275-0079 HE MERELY LET HIS MIND FLOAT IN AN ENDLESS FELICITY ABOUT THE MAN HE THOUGHT HOW NICE IT WOULD BE IF HE HAD TO LIVE UP IN THAT GALLERY WITH THAT ONE MAN FOR EVER HE THOUGHT
2971-4275-0080 NOW HE WAS LIVING IN THE SAME WORLD WITH A MAN AN INEXHAUSTIBLE ECSTASY IN THE GALLERY BELOW THE BALL FATHER MICHAEL HAD FOUND THAT MAN WHO IS THE NOBLEST AND MOST DIVINE AND MOST LOVABLE OF ALL MEN BETTER THAN ALL THE SAINTS
2971-4275-0081 GREATER THAN ALL THE HEROES MAN FRIDAY IN THE CONFUSED COLOUR AND MUSIC OF HIS NEW PARADISE
2971-4275-0082 BEAUTIFUL SOLID MAN SEEMED TO BE MAKING TO HIM REMARKS ABOUT SOMETHING OR OTHER BEING AFTER HOURS AND AGAINST ORDERS HE ALSO SEEMED TO BE ASKING HOW MICHAEL GOT UP THERE THIS BEAUTIFUL MAN
2971-4275-0083 EVIDENTLY FELT AS MICHAEL DID THAT THE EARTH WAS A STAR AND WAS SET IN HEAVEN AT LENGTH MICHAEL SATED HIMSELF WITH THE MERE SENSUAL MUSIC OF THE VOICE OF THE MAN IN BUTTONS HE BEGAN TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID
2971-4275-0084 MICHAEL REALIZED THAT THE IMAGE OF GOD IN NICKEL BUTTONS WAS ASKING HIM HOW HE HAD COME THERE
2971-4275-0085 ON HIS GIVING THIS ANSWER THE DEMEANOUR OF THE IMAGE OF GOD UNDERWENT A REMARKABLE CHANGE FROM ADDRESSING MICHAEL GRUFFLY AS IF HE WERE A MALEFACTOR HE BEGAN SUDDENLY TO SPEAK TO HIM
2971-4275-0086 AMIABILITY AS IF HE WERE A CHILD HE SEEMED PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO COAX HIM AWAY FROM THE BALUSTRADE HE LED HIM BY THE ARM TOWARDS A DOOR LEADING INTO THE BUILDING ITSELF SOOTHING HIM ALL THE TIME
2971-4275-0087 HE GAVE WHAT EVEN MICHAEL SLIGHT AS WAS HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD FELT TO BE AN IMPROBABLE ACCOUNT OF THE SUMPTUOUS PLEASURES AND VARIED ADVANTAGES AWAITING HIM DOWNSTAIRS MICHAEL FOLLOWED HIM HOWEVER IF ONLY OUT OF POLITENESS
2971-4275-0088 DOWN AN APPARENTLY INTERMINABLE SPIRAL OF STAIRCASE AT ONE POINT A DOOR OPENED MICHAEL STEPPED THROUGH IT AND THE UNACCOUNTABLE MAN IN BUTTONS LEAPT AFTER HIM AND PINIONED HIM WHERE HE STOOD
2971-4275-0089 BUT HE ONLY WISHED TO STAND TO STAND AND STARE HE HAD STEPPED AS IT WERE INTO ANOTHER INFINITY OUT UNDER THE DOME OF ANOTHER HEAVEN BUT THIS WAS A DOME OF HEAVEN MADE BY MAN
2971-4275-0090 THE GOLD AND GREEN AND CRIMSON OF ITS SUNSET WERE NOT IN THE SHAPELESS CLOUDS BUT IN SHAPES OF CHERUBIM AND SERAPHIM AWFUL HUMAN SHAPES
2971-4275-0091 ITS STARS WERE NOT ABOVE BUT FAR BELOW LIKE FALLEN STARS STILL IN UNBROKEN CONSTELLATIONS THE DOME ITSELF WAS FULL OF DARKNESS AND FAR BELOW LOWER EVEN THAN THE LIGHTS
2971-4275-0092 COULD BE SEEN CREEPING OR MOTIONLESS GREAT BLACK MASSES OF MEN THE TONGUE OF A TERRIBLE ORGAN
2971-4275-0093 AS IF HE WERE A GOD AND ALL THE VOICES WERE HURLED AT HIM NO THE PRETTY THINGS AREN'T HERE SAID THE DEMI GOD IN BUTTONS CARESSINGLY THE PRETTY THINGS ARE DOWNSTAIRS YOU COME ALONG WITH ME
2971-4275-0094 SO MICHAEL MADE NO ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN HIS FEELINGS TO HIM BUT FOLLOWED HIM MEEKLY ENOUGH DOWN THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENTINE STAIRCASE HE HAD NO NOTION WHERE OR AT WHAT LEVEL HE WAS
2971-4275-0095 HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE FAMILIAR LEVEL IN A STREET FULL OF FACES WITH THE HOUSES AND EVEN THE LAMP POSTS ABOVE HIS HEAD HE FELT SUDDENLY HAPPY AND SUDDENLY INDESCRIBABLY SMALL HE FANCIED
2971-4275-0096 HIS EYES SOUGHT THE PAVEMENT SERIOUSLY AS CHILDREN'S DO AS IF IT WERE A THING WITH WHICH SOMETHING SATISFACTORY COULD BE DONE HE FELT THE FULL WARMTH OF THAT PLEASURE FROM WHICH THE PROUD SHUT THEMSELVES OUT
2971-4275-0097 THE PLEASURE WHICH NOT ONLY GOES WITH HUMILIATION BUT WHICH ALMOST IS HUMILIATION MEN WHO HAVE ESCAPED DEATH BY A HAIR HAVE IT AND MEN WHOSE LOVE IS RETURNED BY A WOMAN UNEXPECTEDLY
2971-4275-0098 AND MEN WHOSE SINS ARE FORGIVEN THEM EVERYTHING HIS EYE FELL ON IT FEASTED ON NOT AESTHETICALLY BUT WITH A PLAIN JOLLY APPETITE AS OF A BOY EATING BUNS
2971-4275-0099 BY THE LIT STAGE OF SOME PROMISING PANTOMIME HE HAPPENED TO SEE IN ONE SHOP WHICH PROJECTED WITH A BULGING BRAVERY ON TO THE PAVEMENT SOME SQUARE TINS OF POTTED MEAT AND IT SEEMED LIKE A HINT
2971-4275-0100 HE WAS PERHAPS THE HAPPIEST OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF MEN FOR IN THAT UNENDURABLE INSTANT WHEN HE HUNG HALF SLIPPING TO THE BALL OF SAINT PAUL'S THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
2971-4275-0101 HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND RE CREATED SUDDENLY THROUGH ALL THE DIN OF THE DARK STREETS CAME A CRASH OF GLASS
2971-4275-0102 OF THE COCKNEY MOB A RUSH WAS MADE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION A DINGY OFFICE NEXT TO THE SHOP OF THE POTTED MEAT THE PANE OF GLASS WAS LYING IN SPLINTERS ABOUT THE PAVEMENT AND THE POLICE ALREADY HAD THEIR HANDS
2971-4275-0103 ON A VERY TALL YOUNG MAN WITH DARK LANK HAIR AND DARK DAZED EYES WITH A GREY PLAID OVER HIS SHOULDER WHO HAD JUST SMASHED THE SHOP WINDOW WITH A SINGLE BLOW OF HIS STICK I'D DO IT AGAIN
2971-4275-0104 SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH A FURIOUS WHITE FACE ANYBODY WOULD HAVE DONE IT DID YOU SEE WHAT IT SAID I SWEAR I'D DO IT AGAIN THEN HIS EYES ENCOUNTERED THE MONKISH HABIT OF MICHAEL AND HE PULLED OFF HIS GREY TAM O' SHANTER
2971-4275-0105 WITH THE GESTURE OF A CATHOLIC FATHER DID YOU SEE WHAT THEY SAID HE CRIED TREMBLING DID YOU SEE WHAT THEY DARED TO SAY I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AT FIRST I READ IT HALF THROUGH BEFORE I BROKE THE WINDOW
2971-4275-0106 WHERE THEY STOOD WITH THE LOVE OF GOD THEY SHOULD NOT MOVE TILL THEY SAW THEIR OWN SWEET AND STARTLING EXISTENCE THEY SHOULD NOT GO FROM THAT PLACE TILL THEY WENT HOME EMBRACING LIKE BROTHERS AND SHOUTING LIKE MEN DELIVERED
2971-4275-0107 FROM THE CROSS FROM WHICH HE HAD FALLEN FELL THE SHADOW OF ITS FANTASTIC MERCY AND THE FIRST THREE WORDS HE SPOKE IN A VOICE LIKE A SILVER TRUMPET HELD MEN AS STILL AS STONES PERHAPS
2971-4275-0108 IF HE HAD SPOKEN THERE FOR AN HOUR IN HIS ILLUMINATION HE MIGHT HAVE FOUNDED A RELIGION ON LUDGATE HILL BUT THE HEAVY HAND OF HIS GUIDE FELL SUDDENLY ON HIS SHOULDER THIS POOR FELLOW IS DOTTY HE SAID GOOD HUMOUREDLY TO THE CROWD
2971-4275-0109 I FOUND HIM WANDERING IN THE CATHEDRAL SAYS HE CAME IN A FLYING SHIP IS THERE A CONSTABLE TO SPARE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM THERE WAS A CONSTABLE TO SPARE TWO OTHER CONSTABLES ATTENDED
2971-4275-0110 TO THE TALL YOUNG MAN IN GREY A FOURTH CONCERNED HIMSELF WITH THE OWNER OF THE SHOP WHO SHOWED SOME TENDENCY TO BE TURBULENT THEY TOOK THE TALL YOUNG MAN AWAY TO A MAGISTRATE WHITHER WE SHALL FOLLOW HIM
2971-4275-0111 IN AN ENSUING CHAPTER AND THEY TOOK THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD AWAY
