8215-117570-0000 AS A SESSION OF A CONVENTION OR EVEN MONTHS AS A SESSION OF CONGRESS IT TERMINATES BY AN ADJOURNMENT WITHOUT DAY THE INTERMEDIATE ADJOURNMENTS FROM DAY TO DAY OR THE RECESSES TAKEN DURING THE DAY DO NOT DESTROY THE CONTINUITY OF THE MEETING
8215-117570-0001 THEY IN REALITY CONSTITUTE ONE SESSION IN THE CASE OF A PERMANENT SOCIETY HAVING REGULAR MEETINGS EVERY WEEK MONTH OR YEAR FOR EXAMPLE EACH MEETING CONSTITUTES A SEPARATE SESSION OF THE SOCIETY WHICH SESSION HOWEVER CAN BE PROLONGED BY ADJOURNING TO ANOTHER DAY
8215-117570-0002 IF A PRINCIPAL MOTION
8215-117570-0003 IS INDEFINITELY POSTPONED OR REJECTED AT ONE SESSION WHILE IT CANNOT BE INTRODUCED AGAIN AT THE SAME SESSION SEE RENEWAL OF A MOTION
8215-117570-0004 WITHOUT IT IS PROHIBITED BY A RULE OF THE ASSEMBLY NO ONE SESSION OF THE ASSEMBLY CAN INTERFERE WITH THE RIGHTS OF THE ASSEMBLY AT ANY FUTURE SESSION
8215-117570-0005 ANY ONE SESSION CAN ADOPT A RULE OR RESOLUTION OF A PERMANENT NATURE AND IT CONTINUES IN FORCE UNTIL AT SOME FUTURE SESSION IT IS RESCINDED BUT THESE STANDING RULES AS THEY ARE TERMED DO NOT INTERFERE WITH FUTURE SESSIONS
8215-117570-0006 BECAUSE AT ANY MOMENT A MAJORITY CAN SUSPEND OR RESCIND THEM OR ADOPT NEW ONES
8215-117570-0007 WITHOUT IT IS EXPRESSLY SO PROVIDED IN THEIR CONSTITUTION BYLAWS OR RULES OF ORDER ALL OF WHICH ARE SO GUARDED BY REQUIRING NOTICE OF AMENDMENTS AND AT LEAST A TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR THEIR ADOPTION THAT THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUDDEN CHANGES
8215-117570-0008 BUT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS EXPRESSING THE DELIBERATE VIEWS OF THE WHOLE SOCIETY RATHER THAN THE OPINIONS OR WISHES OF ANY PARTICULAR MEETING THUS IF THE PRESIDING OFFICER WERE ILL IT WOULD NOT BE COMPETENT FOR ONE SESSION OF THE ASSEMBLY TO ELECT A CHAIRMAN TO HOLD OFFICE LONGER THAN THAT SESSION
8215-117570-0009 AS IT CANNOT CONTROL OR DICTATE TO THE NEXT SESSION OF THE ASSEMBLY BY GOING THROUGH THE PRESCRIBED ROUTINE OF AN ELECTION TO FILL THE VACANCY GIVING WHATEVER NOTICE IS REQUIRED IT COULD THEN LEGALLY ELECT A CHAIRMAN TO HOLD OFFICE WHILE THE VACANCY LASTED
8215-117570-0010 AND THUS ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THE NEXT SESSION FROM CONSIDERING THE QUESTION ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS NOT PERMITTED TO MOVE A RECONSIDERATION
8215-117570-0011 OF A VOTE TAKEN AT A PREVIOUS SESSION THOUGH THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER CAN BE CALLED UP PROVIDED IT WAS MADE AT THE LAST MEETING OF THE PREVIOUS SESSION COMMITTEES CAN BE APPOINTED TO REPORT AT A FUTURE SESSION NOTE ON SESSION
8215-117570-0012 IN CONGRESS AND IN FACT ALL LEGISLATIVE BODIES THE LIMITS OF THE SESSIONS ARE CLEARLY DEFINED BUT IN ORDINARY SOCIETIES HAVING A PERMANENT EXISTENCE WITH REGULAR MEETINGS MORE OR LESS FREQUENT THERE APPEARS TO BE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION UPON THE SUBJECT
8215-117570-0013 ANY SOCIETY IS COMPETENT TO DECIDE WHAT SHALL CONSTITUTE ONE OF ITS SESSIONS BUT WHERE THERE IS NO RULE ON THE SUBJECT THE COMMON PARLIAMENTARY LAW WOULD MAKE EACH OF ITS REGULAR OR SPECIAL MEETINGS A SEPARATE SESSION AS THEY ARE REGARDED IN THIS MANUAL
8215-117570-0014 THE DISADVANTAGES OF A RULE MAKING A SESSION INCLUDE ALL THE MEETINGS OF AN ORDINARY SOCIETY HELD DURING A LONG TIME AS ONE YEAR ARE VERY GREAT EXAMINE INDEFINITELY POSTPONE
8215-117570-0015 AND RENEWAL OF A MOTION
8215-117570-0016 AND REPEATEDLY RENEW OBNOXIOUS OR UNPROFITABLE MOTIONS THE SOCIETY CAN ADOPT A RULE PROHIBITING THE SECOND INTRODUCTION OF ANY PRINCIPAL QUESTION
8215-117570-0017 WITHIN SAY THREE OR SIX MONTHS AFTER ITS REJECTION OR INDEFINITE POSTPONEMENT OR AFTER THE SOCIETY HAS REFUSED TO CONSIDER IT BUT GENERALLY IT IS BETTER TO SUPPRESS THE MOTION BY REFUSING TO CONSIDER IT
8215-117570-0018 A QUORUM OF AN ASSEMBLY IS SUCH A NUMBER AS IS COMPETENT TO TRANSACT ITS BUSINESS WITHOUT THERE IS A SPECIAL RULE ON THE SUBJECT THE QUORUM OF EVERY ASSEMBLY IS A MAJORITY OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY BUT WHENEVER A SOCIETY HAS ANY PERMANENT EXISTENCE
8215-117570-0019 IT IS USUAL TO ADOPT A MUCH SMALLER NUMBER THE QUORUM BEING OFTEN LESS THAN ONE TWENTIETH OF ITS MEMBERS THIS BECOMES A NECESSITY IN MOST LARGE SOCIETIES WHERE ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE MEMBERS ARE EVER PRESENT AT A MEETING
8215-117570-0020 IT IS USUALLY NOT EXPEDIENT TO TRANSACT IMPORTANT BUSINESS WITHOUT THERE IS A FAIR ATTENDANCE AT THE MEETING OR ELSE PREVIOUS NOTICE OF SUCH ACTION HAS BEEN GIVEN
8215-117570-0021 THE CHAIRMAN SHOULD NOT TAKE THE CHAIR TILL A QUORUM IS PRESENT EXCEPT WHERE THERE IS NO HOPE OF THERE BEING A QUORUM
8215-117570-0022 SO WHENEVER DURING THE MEETING THERE IS FOUND NOT TO BE A QUORUM PRESENT THE ONLY THING TO BE DONE IS TO ADJOURN THOUGH IF NO QUESTION IS RAISED ABOUT IT THE DEBATE CAN BE CONTINUED BUT NO VOTE TAKEN EXCEPT TO ADJOURN IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
8215-117570-0023 THE QUORUM IS THE SAME AS IN THE ASSEMBLY IN ANY OTHER COMMITTEE THE MAJORITY IS A QUORUM WITHOUT THE ASSEMBLY ORDER OTHERWISE AND IT MUST WAIT FOR A QUORUM BEFORE PROCEEDING TO BUSINESS IF THE NUMBER AFTERWARDS SHOULD BE REDUCED BELOW A QUORUM BUSINESS IS NOT INTERRUPTED
8215-117570-0024 UNLESS A MEMBER CALLS ATTENTION TO THE FACT BUT NO QUESTION CAN BE DECIDED EXCEPT WHEN A QUORUM IS PRESENT BOARDS OF TRUSTEES MANAGERS DIRECTORS ET CETERA ARE ON THE SAME FOOTING AS COMMITTEES IN REGARD TO A QUORUM
8215-117570-0025 THEIR POWER IS DELEGATED TO THEM AS A BODY AND WHAT NUMBER SHALL BE PRESENT IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY ACT AS A BOARD IS TO BE DECIDED BY THE SOCIETY THAT APPOINTS THE BOARD
8215-117570-0026 WHEN NO RULE HAS BEEN ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING IS THE ORDER ONE READING THE MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING AND THEIR APPROVAL TWO REPORTS OF STANDING COMMITTEES THREE REPORTS OF SELECT COMMITTEES FOUR UNFINISHED BUSINESS
8215-117570-0027 FIVE NEW BUSINESS BOARDS OF MANAGERS TRUSTEES ET CETERA COME UNDER THE HEAD OF STANDING COMMITTEES QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN POSTPONED FROM A PREVIOUS MEETING COME UNDER THE HEAD OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS
8215-117570-0028 IT SHALL TAKE PRECEDENCE OF ALL BUSINESS EXCEPT READING THE MINUTES IF IT IS DESIRED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS OUT OF ITS ORDER IT IS NECESSARY TO SUSPEND THE RULES
8215-117570-0029 WHICH CAN ONLY BE DONE BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE BUT AS EACH SUBJECT COMES UP A MAJORITY CAN AT ONCE LAY IT ON THE TABLE
8215-117570-0030 AND THUS REACH ANY QUESTION WHICH THEY DESIRE TO FIRST DISPOSE OF THE ORDER OF BUSINESS IN CONSIDERING ANY REPORT OR PROPOSITION CONTAINING SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS NO
8215-117570-0031 ONE VOTE BEING TAKEN FINALLY ON THE ADOPTION OF THE WHOLE PAPER BY NOT ADOPTING SEPARATELY THE DIFFERENT PARAGRAPHS IT IS IN ORDER AFTER THEY HAVE ALL BEEN AMENDED TO GO BACK AND AMEND ANY OF THEM STILL FURTHER IN COMMITTEE A SIMILAR PAPER WOULD BE TREATED THE SAME WAY
8215-117570-0032 AN ILLUSTRATION IS GIVEN OF THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THIS SECTION
8215-117570-0033 THEN THE CHAIRMAN SHOULD READ IT BY PARAGRAPHS PAUSING AT THE END OF EACH AND ASKING ARE THERE ANY AMENDMENTS PROPOSED TO THIS PARAGRAPH IF NONE ARE OFFERED HE SAYS NO AMENDMENTS BEING OFFERED TO THIS PARAGRAPH THE NEXT WILL BE READ
8215-117570-0034 HE THEN READS THE NEXT AND PROCEEDS THUS TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH WHEN HE STATES THAT THE WHOLE REPORT OR RESOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN READ AND ARE OPEN TO AMENDMENT HE FINALLY PUTS THE QUESTION ON AGREEING TO OR ADOPTING THE WHOLE PAPER AS AMENDED
8215-117570-0035 IF THERE IS A PREAMBLE IT SHOULD BE READ AFTER THE LAST PARAGRAPH IF THE PAPER HAS BEEN REPORTED BACK BY A COMMITTEE WITH AMENDMENTS THE CLERK READS ONLY THE AMENDMENTS
8215-117570-0036 AND PUTS IT TO THE QUESTION AND SO ON TILL ALL THE AMENDMENTS ARE ADOPTED OR REJECTED ADMITTING AMENDMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS BUT NO OTHERS
8215-117570-0037 AND WHEN THESE ARE VOTED ON HE PUTS THE QUESTION ON AGREEING TO OR ADOPTING THE PAPER AS AMENDED WHERE THE RESOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN JUST READ BY THE MEMBER PRESENTING THEM THE READING BY THE CLERK IS USUALLY DISPENSED WITH WITHOUT THE FORMALITY OF A VOTE
8215-117570-0038 BY SUSPENDING THE RULES
8215-117570-0039 AMENDMENTS OF RULES OF ORDER THESE RULES CAN BE AMENDED AT ANY REGULAR MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT PROVIDED THE AMENDMENT WAS SUBMITTED IN WRITING AT THE PREVIOUS REGULAR MEETING
8215-117570-0040 AND NO AMENDMENT TO CONSTITUTIONS OR BY LAWS SHALL BE PERMITTED WITHOUT AT LEAST EQUAL NOTICE AND A TWO THIRDS VOTE
8215-117570-0041 CONSTITUTIONS BY LAWS AND RULES OF ORDER SHOULD ALWAYS PROHIBIT THEIR BEING AMENDED BY LESS THAN A TWO THIRDS VOTE AND WITHOUT PREVIOUS NOTICE OF THE AMENDMENT BEING GIVEN
8215-117570-0042 IF THE BY LAWS SHOULD CONTAIN RULES THAT IT MAY BE DESIRABLE TO OCCASIONALLY SUSPEND THEN THEY SHOULD STATE HOW THEY CAN BE SUSPENDED JUST AS IS DONE IN THESE RULES OF ORDER SEC EIGHTEEN
