6967-50150-0000 AMABEL SLEPT AND AWAKENED TO THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS HER WEDDING DAY SHE WAS NOT TO APPEAR AT THE FIRST BREAKFAST BUT SHE CAME TO MEET CHARLES IN THE DRESSING ROOM AND AS THEY SAT TOGETHER ON THE SOFA
6967-50150-0001 ARM HIS GIFT A BRACELET OF HIS MOTHER'S HAIR HIS FINGERS TREMBLED AND HIS EYES WERE HAZY BUT HE WOULD NOT LET HER HELP HIM HER THANKS WERE OBLIGED TO BE ALL KISSES NO WORDS WOULD COME BUT CHARLIE CHARLIE HOW COULD I EVER HAVE PROMISED TO LEAVE YOU
6967-50150-0002 NONSENSE WHO EVER DREAMT THAT MY SISTERS WERE TO BE THREE MONKEYS TIED TO A DOG IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SMILE THOUGH IT WAS BUT FOR A MOMENT CHARLES'S MIRTH WAS MELANCHOLY
6967-50150-0003 AND DEAR CHARLIE YOU WILL NOT MISS ME SO VERY MUCH DO PRAY LET CHARLOTTE WAIT UPON YOU AFTER THE FIRST PERHAPS I MAY NOT HATE HER OH AMY I LITTLE KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING WHEN I TRIED TO GET HIM BACK AGAIN FOR YOU I
6967-50150-0004 STAND UP AND LET ME TAKE A SURVEY VERY PRETTY I DECLARE YOU DO MY EDUCATION CREDIT THERE IF IT WILL BE FOR YOUR PEACE I'LL DO MY BEST TO WEAR ON WITHOUT YOU
6967-50150-0005 THE ONLY ONE I COULD FORGIVE FOR PRESUMING TO STEAL YOU AMY HERE HE IS COME IN HE ADDED AS GUY KNOCKED AT HIS DOOR TO OFFER TO HELP HIM DOWN STAIRS GUY HARDLY SPOKE AND AMY COULD NOT LOOK IN HIS FACE
6967-50150-0006 IT WAS LATE AND HE TOOK DOWN CHARLES AT ONCE AFTER THIS SHE HAD VERY LITTLE QUIET EVERY ONE WAS BUZZING ABOUT HER AND PUTTING THE LAST TOUCHES TO HER DRESS AT LAST JUST AS SHE WAS QUITE FINISHED CHARLOTTE EXCLAIMED
6967-50150-0007 OH THERE IS GUY'S STEP MAY I CALL HIM IN TO HAVE ONE LOOK MISSUS EDMONSTONE DID NOT SAY NO AND CHARLOTTE OPENING THE DRESSING ROOM DOOR CALLED TO HIM HE STOOD OPPOSITE TO AMY FOR SOME MOMENTS THEN SAID WITH A SMILE
6967-50150-0008 I WAS WRONG ABOUT THE GROGRAM I WOULD NOT FOR ANYTHING SEE YOU LOOK OTHERWISE THAN YOU DO IT SEEMED TO MISSUS EDMONSTONE AND LAURA THAT THESE WORDS MADE THEM LOSE SIGHT OF THE DETAILS OF LACE AND SILK THAT HAD BEEN OCCUPYING THEM
6967-50150-0009 SO THAT THEY ONLY SAW THE RADIANCE PURITY AND INNOCENCE OF AMY'S BRIDAL APPEARANCE NO MORE WAS SAID FOR MISTER EDMONSTONE RAN UP TO CALL GUY WHO WAS TO DRIVE CHARLES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE AMABEL OF COURSE WENT WITH HER PARENTS POOR CHILD
6967-50150-0010 HER TEARS FLOWED FREELY ON THE WAY AND MISTER EDMONSTONE
6967-50150-0011 WAS VERY MUCH OVERCOME WHILE HIS WIFE HARDLY REFRAINING FROM TEARS COULD ONLY HOLD HER DAUGHTER'S HAND VERY CLOSE THE REGULAR MORNING SERVICE WAS A GREAT COMFORT BY RESTORING THEIR TRANQUILLITY
6967-50150-0012 AND BY THE TIME IT WAS ENDED AMABEL'S COUNTENANCE HAD SETTLED INTO ITS OWN CALM EXPRESSION OF TRUST AND SERENITY SHE SCARCELY EVEN TREMBLED WHEN HER FATHER LED HER FORWARD HER HAND DID NOT SHAKE AND HER VOICE THOUGH VERY LOW
6967-50150-0013 WAS FIRM AND AUDIBLE WHILE GUY'S DEEP SWEET TONES HAD A SORT OF THRILL AND QUIVER OF INTENSE FEELING NO ONE COULD HELP OBSERVING THAT LAURA WAS THE MOST AGITATED PERSON PRESENT
6967-50150-0014 SHE TREMBLED SO MUCH THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAN ON CHARLOTTE AND HER TEARS GAVE THE INFECTION TO THE OTHER BRIDESMAIDS ALL BUT MARY ROSS WHO COULD NEVER CRY WHEN OTHER PEOPLE DID AND LITTLE MARIANNE WHO DID NOTHING BUT LOOK AND WONDER
6967-50150-0015 MARY WAS FEELING A GREAT DEAL BOTH OF COMPASSION FOR THE BEREAVED FAMILY AND OF AFFECTIONATE ADMIRING JOY FOR THE YOUNG PAIR WHO KNELT BEFORE THE ALTAR IT WAS A SHOWERY DAY WITH GLEAMS OF VIVID SUNSHINE
6967-50150-0016 AND ONE OF THESE SUDDENLY BROKE FORTH CASTING A STREAM OF COLOUR FROM A MARTYR'S FIGURE IN THE SOUTH WINDOW SO AS TO SHED A GOLDEN GLORY ON THE WAVE OF BROWN HAIR OVER GUY'S FOREHEAD THEN PASSING ON AND TINTING THE BRIDE'S WHITE VEIL
6967-50150-0017 EITHER THAT GOLDEN LIGHT OR THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACE ON WHICH IT BEAMED MADE MARY THINK OF THE LINES WHERE IS THE BROW TO WEAR IN MORTAL'S SIGHT THE CROWN OF PURE ANGELIC LIGHT CHARLES STOOD WITH HIS HEAD LEANING AGAINST A PILLAR AS IF HE COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK UP
6967-50150-0018 MISTER EDMONSTONE WAS RESTLESS AND ALMOST SOBBING MISSUS EDMONSTONE ALONE COLLECTED THOUGH MUCH FLUSHED AND SOMEWHAT TREMBLING WHILE THE ONLY PERSON APPARENTLY FREE FROM EXCITEMENT WAS THE LITTLE BRIDE
6967-50150-0019 HER HAND CLASPED IN HIS HER HEAD BENT DOWN HER MODEST STEADFAST FACE LOOKING AS IF SHE WAS ONLY CONSCIOUS OF THE VOW SHE EXCHANGED THE BLESSING SHE RECEIVED AND WAS AS IT WERE LIFTED OUT OF HERSELF
6967-50150-0020 IT WAS OVER NOW THE FEAST IN ITS FULLEST SENSE WAS HELD AND THE RICHEST OF BLESSINGS HAD BEEN CALLED DOWN ON THEM
6967-50150-0021 IN THE FRESH BRIGHT GRACIOUSNESS OF THEIR EXTREME YOUTH AND THE SIX BRIDESMAIDS FOLLOWING LAURA AND LADY EVELEEN TWO STRIKINGLY HANDSOME AND ELEGANT GIRLS CHARLOTTE WITH THE PRETTY LITTLE FAIR MARIANNE MARY ROSS AND GRACE HARPER
6967-50150-0022 THE VILLAGE PEOPLE WHO STOOD ROUND MIGHT WELL SAY THAT SUCH A SIGHT AS THAT WAS WORTH COMING TWENTY MILES TO SEE
6967-50150-0023 HIM HER ESPECIAL CHARGE AND TO SUCCEED TO ALL AMY'S RIGHTS MISSUS EDMONSTONE ASKED WHETHER LAURA WOULD NOT PREFER GOING WITH HIM BUT SHE HASTILY ANSWERED NO THANK YOU LET CHARLOTTE FOR WITH HER TROUBLED FEELINGS
6967-50150-0024 SHE COULD BETTER ANSWER TALKING GIRLS THAN PARRY THE REMARKS OF HER SHREWD OBSERVANT BROTHER SOME ONE SAID IT WOULD RAIN BUT CHARLOTTE STILL PLEADED EARNESTLY
6967-50150-0025 CHARLOTTE DROVE OFF WITH ELABORATE CARE THEN CAME A DEEP SIGH AND SHE EXCLAIMED WELL HE IS OUR BROTHER AND ALL IS SAFE YES SAID CHARLES NO MORE FEARS FOR THEM HAD YOU ANY I AM VERY GLAD IF YOU HAD WHY
6967-50150-0026 QUITE GRAND AND TERRIBLE AS IF HE MUST ACT OGRE I AM NOT SURE
6967-50150-0027 THAT HE MIGHT APPEAR SUDDENLY AND FORBID THE BANNS ENTIRELY FOR AMY'S SAKE AND AS THE GREATEST KINDNESS TO HER OH HOWEVER HE CAN'T SEPARATE THEM NOW LET HIM DO HIS WORST AND WHILE AMY IS GUY'S WIFE I DON'T THINK WE SHALL EASILY BE MADE TO QUARREL
6967-50150-0028 I AM GLAD THE KNOT IS TIED FOR I HAD A FATALITY NOTION THAT THE FEUD WAS SO STRONG THAT IT WAS NEARLY A CASE OF THE MOUNTAINS BENDING AND THE STREAMS ASCENDING
6967-50150-0029 NO SAID CHARLOTTE IT OUGHT TO BE LIKE THAT STORY OF ROSAURA AND HER KINDRED DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE FATE WOULD NOT BE APPEASED BY THE MARRIAGE TILL COUNT JULIUS HAD SAVED THE LIFE OF ONE OF THE HOSTILE RACE THAT WOULD BE IT PERHAPS THEY WILL MEET ABROAD AND GUY WILL DO IT
6967-50150-0030 THAT WON'T DO PHILIP WILL NEVER ENDANGER HIS PRECIOUS LIFE NOR EVER FORGIVE GUY THE OBLIGATION WELL I SUPPOSE THERE NEVER WAS A PRETTIER WEDDING HOW SILLY OF ME TO SAY SO I SHALL BE SICK OF HEARING IT BEFORE
6967-50150-0031 I DO WISH ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE GONE
6967-50150-0032 I SHOULD LIKE TO SHUT MYSELF UP AND CRY AND THINK WHAT I COULD EVER DO TO WAIT ON YOU INDEED CHARLIE I KNOW I NEVER CAN BE LIKE AMY BUT IF YOU BE ANYTHING BUT SENTIMENTAL I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF SAID CHARLES WITH A SMILE AND TONE AS IF HE WAS KEEPING SORROW AT BAY
6967-50150-0033 WERE LEFT TO OURSELVES THIS EVENING WE SHOULD BE SO DESPERATELY SAVAGE THAT WE SHOULD QUARREL FURIOUSLY AND THERE WOULD BE NO AMY TO SET US TO RIGHTS

6967-50150-0035 BUT HOW LOVELY DEAR AMY DID LOOK HERE'S THE RAIN EXCLAIMED CHARLES AS SOME LARGE DROPS BEGAN TO FALL IN GOOD TIME TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING EITHER SAVAGE OR SENTIMENTAL THOUGH AT THE EXPENSE OF CHARLOTTE'S PINK AND WHITE
6967-50150-0036 FOR THEY HAD NO UMBRELLA AND SHE WOULD NOT ACCEPT A SHARE OF CHARLES'S CARRIAGE CLOAK SHE LAUGHED AND DROVE ON FAST THROUGH THE SHORT CUT AND ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE DOOR JUST AS THE PELTING HAIL WAS OVER HAVING BATTERED HER THIN SLEEVES
6967-50150-0037 AND MADE HER WHITE BONNET LOOK VERY DEPLORABLE THE FIRST THING THEY SAW WAS GUY WITH BUSTLE CLOSE TO HIM FOR BUSTLE HAD FOUND OUT THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON THAT CONCERNED HIS MASTER AND FOLLOWED HIM ABOUT MORE ASSIDUOUSLY THAN EVER AS IF
6967-50150-0038 THAT HE WAS TO BE LEFT BEHIND TO CHARLOTTE'S CARE CHARLOTTE HOW WET YOU ARE NEVER MIND CHARLIE IS NOT SHE SPRUNG OUT HOLDING HIS HAND AND FELT AS IF SHE COULD NEVER FORGET THAT MOMENT WHEN HER NEW BROTHER FIRST KISSED HER BROW WHERE'S AMY
