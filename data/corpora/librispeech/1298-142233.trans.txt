1298-142233-0000 MISTER LADLEY HAD ONCE BEEN WELL KNOWN IN NEW YORK AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO FREQUENT THE THEATERS AND JENNIE BRICE WAS EVEN BETTER KNOWN A GOOD MANY LAWYERS I BELIEVE SAID THAT THE POLICE HAD NOT A LEG TO STAND ON
1298-142233-0001 AND I KNOW THE CASE WAS WATCHED WITH MUCH INTEREST BY THE LEGAL PROFESSION PEOPLE WROTE LETTERS TO THE NEWSPAPERS PROTESTING AGAINST MISTER LADLEY BEING HELD AND I BELIEVE THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN TAKING HIM BEFORE THE GRAND JURY
1298-142233-0002 HARDLY HOPED TO MAKE A CASE BUT HE DID TO HIS OWN SURPRISE I FANCY AND THE TRIAL WAS SET FOR MAY BUT IN THE MEANTIME MANY CURIOUS THINGS HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WEEK FOLLOWING MISTER LADLEY'S ARREST
1298-142233-0003 MY HOUSE WAS FILLED UP WITH EIGHT OR TEN MEMBERS
1298-142233-0004 VERY CHEERFUL AND JOLLY AND WELL BEHAVED THREE MEN I THINK AND THE REST GIRLS ONE OF THE MEN WAS NAMED BELLOWS JOHN BELLOWS AND IT TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD KNOWN JENNIE BRICE VERY WELL
1298-142233-0005 FROM THE MOMENT HE LEARNED THAT MISTER HOLCOMBE HARDLY LEFT HIM HE WALKED TO THE THEATER WITH HIM AND WAITED TO WALK HOME AGAIN HE TOOK HIM OUT TO RESTAURANTS AND FOR LONG STREET CAR RIDES IN THE MORNINGS AND ON THE LAST NIGHT OF THEIR STAY
1298-142233-0006 SATURDAY THEY GOT GLORIOUSLY DRUNK TOGETHER MISTER HOLCOMBE NO DOUBT IN HIS CHARACTER OF LADLEY AND CAME REELING IN AT THREE IN THE MORNING SINGING MISTER HOLCOMBE WAS VERY SICK THE NEXT DAY BUT BY MONDAY HE WAS ALL RIGHT
1298-142233-0007 AND HE CALLED ME INTO THE ROOM WE'VE GOT HIM MISSUS PITMAN HE SAID LOOKING MOTTLED BUT CHEERFUL AS SURE AS GOD MADE LITTLE FISHES WE'VE GOT HIM THAT WAS ALL HE WOULD SAY HOWEVER
1298-142233-0008 IT SEEMED HE WAS GOING TO NEW YORK AND MIGHT BE GONE FOR A MONTH I'VE NO FAMILY HE SAID AND ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP ME IF I FIND MY RELAXATION IN HUNTING DOWN CRIMINALS IT'S A HARMLESS AND CHEAP AMUSEMENT
1298-142233-0009 AND IT'S MY OWN BUSINESS HE WENT AWAY THAT NIGHT AND I MUST ADMIT I MISSED HIM I RENTED THE PARLOR BEDROOM THE NEXT DAY TO A SCHOOL TEACHER AND I FOUND THE PERISCOPE AFFAIR VERY HANDY
1298-142233-0010 I COULD SEE JUST HOW MUCH GAS SHE USED AND ALTHOUGH THE NOTICE ON EACH DOOR FORBIDS COOKING AND WASHING IN ROOMS I FOUND SHE WAS DOING BOTH MAKING COFFEE AND BOILING AN EGG IN THE MORNING AND RUBBING OUT STOCKINGS AND HANDKERCHIEFS IN HER WASH BOWL
1298-142233-0011 I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE MEN AS BOARDERS THAN WOMEN THE WOMEN ARE ALWAYS LIGHTING ALCOHOL LAMPS ON THE BUREAU AND WANTING THE BED TURNED INTO A COZY CORNER SO THEY CAN SEE THEIR GENTLEMEN FRIENDS IN THEIR ROOMS
1298-142233-0012 WELL WITH MISTER HOLCOMBE GONE AND MISTER REYNOLDS BUSY ALL DAY AND HALF THE NIGHT GETTING OUT THE SUMMER SILKS AND PREPARING FOR REMNANT DAY AND WITH MISTER LADLEY IN JAIL AND LIDA OUT OF THE CITY FOR I SAW IN THE PAPERS
1298-142233-0013 THAT SHE WAS NOT WELL AND HER MOTHER HAD TAKEN HER TO BERMUDA I HAD A GOOD BIT OF TIME ON MY HANDS AND SO I GOT IN THE HABIT OF THINKING THINGS OVER AND TRYING TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS AS I HAD SEEN MISTER HOLCOMBE DO
1298-142233-0014 AND STUDY THEM OVER AND ESPECIALLY I WORRIED OVER HOW WE COULD HAVE FOUND A SLIP OF PAPER IN MISTER LADLEY'S ROOM WITH A LIST ALMOST EXACT OF THE THINGS WE HAD DISCOVERED THERE I USED TO READ IT OVER ROPE
1298-142233-0015 KNIFE SHOE TOWEL HORN AND GET MORE AND MORE BEWILDERED HORN MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TOWN OR IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THERE WAS SUCH A TOWN ACCORDING TO MISTER GRAVES
1298-142233-0016 BUT APPARENTLY HE HAD MADE NOTHING OF IT WAS IT A TOWN THAT WAS MEANT THE DICTIONARY GAVE ONLY A FEW WORDS BEGINNING WITH HORN HORNET HORNBLENDE HORNPIPE AND HORNY
1298-142233-0017 NONE OF WHICH WAS OF ANY ASSISTANCE AND THEN ONE MORNING I HAPPENED TO SEE IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN OF ONE OF THE NEWSPAPERS THAT A WOMAN NAMED ELIZA SHAEFFER OF HORNER
1298-142233-0018 PERHAPS IT HAD BEEN HORNER AND POSSIBLY THIS VERY ELIZA SHAEFFER I SUPPOSE MY LACK OF EXPERIENCE WAS IN MY FAVOR FOR AFTER ALL ELIZA SHAEFFER IS A COMMON ENOUGH NAME
1298-142233-0019 AND THE HORN MIGHT HAVE STOOD FOR HORNSWOGGLE FOR ALL I KNEW THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO THOUGHT OF WHAT HE WOULD DO IF HE WERE A HORSE CAME BACK TO ME AND FOR AN HOUR OR SO I TRIED TO THINK I WAS JENNIE BRICE
1298-142233-0020 TRYING TO GET AWAY AND HIDE FROM MY RASCAL OF A HUSBAND BUT I MADE NO HEADWAY I WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO HORNER OR TO ANY SMALL TOWN IF I HAD WANTED TO HIDE I THINK I SHOULD HAVE GONE AROUND THE CORNER
1298-142233-0021 AND TAKEN A ROOM IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD OR HAVE LOST MYSELF IN SOME LARGE CITY IT WAS THAT SAME DAY THAT SINCE I DID NOT GO TO HORNER HORNER CAME TO ME
1298-142233-0022 THE BELL RANG ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK AND I ANSWERED IT MYSELF FOR WITH TIMES HARD AND ONLY TWO OR THREE ROOMERS ALL WINTER I HAD NOT HAD A SERVANT EXCEPT TERRY TO DO ODD JOBS FOR SOME MONTHS
1298-142233-0023 THERE STOOD A FRESH FACED YOUNG GIRL WITH A COVERED BASKET IN HER HAND ARE YOU MISSUS PITMAN SHE ASKED I DON'T NEED ANYTHING TO DAY I SAID TRYING TO SHUT THE DOOR AND AT THAT MINUTE
1298-142233-0024 SOMETHING IN THE BASKET CHEEPED YOUNG WOMEN SELLING POULTRY ARE NOT COMMON IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHAT HAVE YOU THERE I ASKED MORE AGREEABLY CHICKS DAY OLD CHICKS BUT I'M NOT TRYING TO SELL YOU ANY I
1298-142233-0025 MAY I COME IN IT WAS DAWNING ON ME THEN THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS ELIZA SHAEFFER I LED HER BACK TO THE DINING ROOM WITH PETER SNIFFING AT THE BASKET MY NAME IS SHAEFFER SHE SAID
1298-142233-0026 I'VE SEEN YOUR NAME IN THE PAPERS AND I BELIEVE I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT JENNIE BRICE ELIZA SHAEFFER'S STORY WAS CURIOUS SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS POSTMISTRESS AT HORNER
1298-142233-0027 AND WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED TO FIND NO STORE OF ANY SIZE IN THE TOWN THE WOMAN WHO HAD REGISTERED AS MISSUS JANE BELLOWS SAID SHE WAS TIRED AND WOULD LIKE TO REST FOR A DAY OR TWO ON A FARM
1298-142233-0028 SHE WAS TOLD TO SEE ELIZA SHAEFFER AT THE POST OFFICE AND AS A RESULT DROVE OUT WITH HER TO THE FARM AFTER THE LAST MAIL CAME IN THAT EVENING ASKED TO DESCRIBE HER SHE WAS OVER MEDIUM HEIGHT LIGHT HAIRED
1298-142233-0029 QUICK IN HER MOVEMENTS AND WORE A BLACK AND WHITE STRIPED DRESS WITH A RED COLLAR AND A HAT TO MATCH SHE CARRIED A SMALL BROWN VALISE THAT MISS SHAEFFER PRESUMED CONTAINED HER SAMPLES
1298-142233-0030 MISSUS SHAEFFER HAD MADE HER WELCOME ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT USUALLY TAKE BOARDERS UNTIL JUNE SHE HAD NOT EATEN MUCH SUPPER AND THAT NIGHT SHE HAD ASKED FOR PEN AND INK AND HAD WRITTEN A LETTER
1298-142233-0031 THE LETTER WAS NOT MAILED UNTIL WEDNESDAY ALL OF TUESDAY MISSUS BELLOWS HAD SPENT IN HER ROOM AND MISSUS SHAEFFER HAD DRIVEN TO THE VILLAGE IN THE AFTERNOON WITH WORD THAT SHE HAD BEEN CRYING ALL DAY
1298-142233-0032 AND BOUGHT SOME HEADACHE MEDICINE FOR HER ON WEDNESDAY MORNING HOWEVER SHE HAD APPEARED AT BREAKFAST
1298-142233-0033 IT WAS ADDRESSED TO MISTER ELLIS HOWELL IN CARE OF A PITTSBURGH NEWSPAPER THAT NIGHT WHEN MISS ELIZA WENT HOME ABOUT HALF PAST EIGHT THE WOMAN WAS GONE
1298-142233-0034 SHE HAD PAID FOR HER ROOM AND HAD BEEN DRIVEN AS FAR AS THORNVILLE WHERE ALL TRACE OF HER HAD BEEN LOST ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JENNIE BRICE BEING PUBLISHED SHORTLY AFTER THAT SHE AND HER MOTHER HAD DRIVEN TO THORNVILLE
1298-142233-0035 BUT THE STATION AGENT THERE WAS SURLY AS WELL AS STUPID THEY HAD LEARNED NOTHING ABOUT THE WOMAN SINCE THAT TIME THREE MEN HAD MADE INQUIRIES ABOUT THE WOMAN IN QUESTION ONE HAD A POINTED VANDYKE BEARD
1298-142233-0036 THE SECOND FROM THE DESCRIPTION I FANCIED MUST HAVE BEEN MISTER GRAVES THE THIRD WITHOUT DOUBT WAS MISTER HOWELL ELIZA SHAEFFER SAID THAT THIS LAST MAN HAD SEEMED HALF FRANTIC
1298-142233-0037 I BROUGHT HER A PHOTOGRAPH OF JENNIE BRICE AS TOPSY AND ANOTHER ONE AS JULIET SHE SAID THERE WAS A RESEMBLANCE BUT THAT IT ENDED THERE BUT OF COURSE AS MISTER GRAVES HAD SAID
1298-142233-0038 BY THE TIME AN ACTRESS GETS HER PHOTOGRAPH RETOUCHED TO SUIT HER IT DOESN'T PARTICULARLY RESEMBLE HER AND UNLESS I HAD KNOWN JENNIE BRICE MYSELF I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE RECOGNIZED THE PICTURES WELL IN SPITE OF ALL THAT
1298-142233-0039 THERE SEEMED NO DOUBT THAT JENNIE BRICE HAD BEEN LIVING THREE DAYS AFTER HER DISAPPEARANCE AND THAT WOULD CLEAR MISTER LADLEY BUT WHAT HAD MISTER HOWELL TO DO WITH IT ALL WHY HAD HE NOT TOLD THE POLICE OF THE LETTER FROM HORNER
1298-142233-0040 OR ABOUT THE WOMAN ON THE BRIDGE WHY HAD MISTER BRONSON WHO WAS LIKELY THE MAN WITH THE POINTED BEARD SAID NOTHING ABOUT HAVING TRACED JENNIE BRICE TO HORNER I DID AS I THOUGHT MISTER HOLCOMBE WOULD HAVE WISHED ME TO DO
1298-142233-0041 ALL THAT ELIZA SHAEFFER SAID THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BLACK AND WHITE DRESS THE WOMAN'S HEIGHT AND THE REST AND THEN I TOOK HER TO THE COURT HOUSE CHICKS AND ALL AND SHE TOLD HER STORY THERE TO ONE OF THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS
1298-142233-0042 THE YOUNG MAN WAS INTERESTED BUT NOT CONVINCED HE HAD HER STORY TAKEN DOWN AND SHE SIGNED IT HE WAS SMILING AS HE BOWED US OUT I TURNED IN THE DOORWAY THIS WILL FREE MISTER LADLEY I SUPPOSE
1298-142233-0043 TO THE LAST STILTED ARCH AND COLONIAL VOLUTE IN EVERY NEWSPAPER IN THE UNITED STATES THAT EVENING THE NEWSPAPERS ANNOUNCED THAT DURING A CONFERENCE AT THE JAIL BETWEEN MISTER LADLEY AND JAMES BRONSON
1298-142233-0044 MISTER LADLEY HAD ATTACKED MISTER BRONSON WITH A CHAIR
