4216-10192-0000 THE POSTMARK AND THE HANDWRITING ON THE ADDRESS ADMIRABLY IMITATED FROM THE ORIGINAL WARNED MISSUS LECOUNT OF THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER BEFORE SHE OPENED IT AFTER WAITING A MOMENT TO COMPOSE HERSELF
4216-10192-0001 SHE READ THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER BROTHER'S RELAPSE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE HANDWRITING THERE WAS NO EXPRESSION IN ANY PART OF THE LETTER WHICH COULD SUGGEST TO HER MIND THE FAINTEST SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY
4216-10192-0002 SHE BECAME PALE AND OLD AND HAGGARD IN A MOMENT THOUGHTS FAR REMOVED FROM HER PRESENT AIMS AND INTERESTS REMEMBRANCES THAT CARRIED HER BACK TO OTHER LANDS THAN ENGLAND TO OTHER TIMES THAN THE TIME OF HER LIFE IN SERVICE
4216-10192-0003 PROLONGED THEIR INNER SHADOWS TO THE SURFACE AND SHOWED THE TRACES OF THEIR MYSTERIOUS PASSAGE DARKLY ON HER FACE THE MINUTES FOLLOWED EACH OTHER AND STILL THE SERVANT BELOW STAIRS WAITED VAINLY FOR THE PARLOR BELL
4216-10192-0004 THE MINUTES FOLLOWED EACH OTHER AND STILL SHE SAT TEARLESS AND QUIET DEAD TO THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE LIVING IN THE PAST THE ENTRANCE OF THE SERVANT UNCALLED ROUSED HER WITH A HEAVY SIGH
4216-10192-0005 THE COLD AND SECRET WOMAN FOLDED THE LETTER UP AGAIN AND ADDRESSED HERSELF TO THE INTERESTS AND THE DUTIES OF THE PASSING TIME SHE DECIDED THE QUESTION OF GOING OR NOT GOING TO ZURICH AFTER A VERY BRIEF CONSIDERATION OF IT
4216-10192-0006 BEFORE SHE HAD DRAWN HER CHAIR TO THE BREAKFAST TABLE SHE HAD RESOLVED TO GO ADMIRABLY AS CAPTAIN WRAGGE'S STRATAGEM HAD WORKED IT MIGHT HAVE FAILED UNASSISTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF THE MORNING TO ACHIEVE THIS RESULT
4216-10192-0007 THE VERY ACCIDENT AGAINST WHICH IT HAD BEEN THE CAPTAIN'S CHIEF ANXIETY TO GUARD THE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE IN SPITE OF HIM
4216-10192-0008 THE ONE EVENT WHICH FALSIFIED EVERY PREVIOUS CALCULATION BY DIRECTLY FORWARDING THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE CONSPIRACY IF MISSUS LECOUNT HAD NOT OBTAINED THE INFORMATION OF WHICH SHE WAS IN SEARCH BEFORE THE RECEIPT OF THE LETTER FROM ZURICH
4216-10192-0009 THE LETTER MIGHT HAVE ADDRESSED HER IN VAIN SHE WOULD HAVE HESITATED BEFORE DECIDING TO LEAVE ENGLAND AND THAT HESITATION MIGHT HAVE PROVED FATAL TO THE CAPTAIN'S SCHEME AS IT WAS WITH THE PLAIN PROOFS IN HER POSSESSION
4216-10192-0010 WITH THE GOWN DISCOVERED IN MAGDALEN'S WARDROBE
4216-10192-0011 AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED FROM MISSUS WRAGGE OF THE VERY HOUSE IN WHICH THE DISGUISE HAD BEEN PUT ON
4216-10192-0012 HAD NOW AT HER COMMAND THE MEANS OF WARNING NOEL VANSTONE AS SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WARN HIM YET OR IN OTHER WORDS THE MEANS OF GUARDING AGAINST ANY DANGEROUS TENDENCIES TOWARD RECONCILIATION WITH THE BYGRAVES
4216-10192-0013 WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE ENTERED HIS MIND DURING HER ABSENCE AT ZURICH THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WHICH NOW PERPLEXED HER WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF DECIDING WHETHER SHE SHOULD COMMUNICATE WITH HER MASTER PERSONALLY OR BY WRITING
4216-10192-0014 SHE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE DOCTOR'S LETTER THE WORD INSTANTLY IN THE SENTENCE WHICH SUMMONED HER TO HER DYING BROTHER WAS TWICE UNDERLINED ADMIRAL BARTRAM'S HOUSE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE RAILWAY
4216-10192-0015 THERE WAS NO CHOICE ON A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH BUT TO SAVE THE PRECIOUS HOURS BY WRITING TO HIM AFTER SENDING TO SECURE A PLACE AT ONCE IN THE EARLY COACH SHE SAT DOWN TO WRITE TO HER MASTER
4216-10192-0016 OF THE ALPACA DRESS WAS KNOWN TO NO LIVING CREATURE BUT HERSELF AND UNTIL HER RETURN TO ENGLAND SHE DETERMINED TO KEEP IT TO HERSELF THE NECESSARY IMPRESSION
4216-10192-0017 MIGHT BE PRODUCED ON NOEL VANSTONE'S MIND WITHOUT VENTURING INTO DETAILS SHE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THE FORM OF LETTER WHICH MIGHT BE TRUSTED TO PRODUCE AN EFFECT ON HIM AND SHE NOW WROTE IT IN THESE WORDS
4216-10192-0018 SAD NEWS HAS REACHED ME FROM SWITZERLAND MY BELOVED BROTHER IS DYING AND HIS MEDICAL ATTENDANT SUMMONS ME INSTANTLY TO ZURICH
4216-10192-0019 TO THE CONTINENT LEAVES ME BUT ONE ALTERNATIVE I MUST PROFIT BY THE PERMISSION TO LEAVE ENGLAND IF NECESSARY
4216-10192-0020 INSTEAD OF TURNING ASIDE AS I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE YOU FIRST AT SAINT CRUX PAINFULLY AS I AM AFFECTED BY THE FAMILY CALAMITY WHICH HAS FALLEN ON ME I CANNOT LET THIS OPPORTUNITY PASS WITHOUT ADVERTING TO ANOTHER SUBJECT
4216-10192-0021 WAS NOT THE ONLY OBJECT WHICH MISTER BYGRAVE HAD IN FORCING HIMSELF ON YOUR ACQUAINTANCE THE INFAMOUS CONSPIRACY WITH WHICH YOU WERE THREATENED IN LONDON HAS BEEN IN FULL PROGRESS AGAINST YOU UNDER MISTER BYGRAVE'S DIRECTION
4216-10192-0022 HAS PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF INFORMATION PRECIOUS TO YOUR FUTURE SECURITY I HAVE DISCOVERED TO AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT THE PERSON CALLING HERSELF MISS BYGRAVE IS NO OTHER THAN THE WOMAN WHO VISITED US IN DISGUISE AT VAUXHALL WALK
4216-10192-0023 I SUSPECTED THIS FROM THE FIRST BUT I HAD NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT MY SUSPICIONS I HAD NO MEANS OF COMBATING THE FALSE IMPRESSION PRODUCED ON YOU MY HANDS I THANK HEAVEN ARE TIED NO LONGER
4216-10192-0024 I POSSESS ABSOLUTE PROOF OF THE ASSERTION THAT I HAVE JUST MADE PROOF THAT YOUR OWN EYES CAN SEE PROOF THAT WOULD SATISFY YOU IF YOU WERE JUDGE IN A COURT OF JUSTICE PERHAPS EVEN YET MISTER NOEL YOU WILL REFUSE TO BELIEVE ME
4216-10192-0025 AND YOU WILL CERTAINLY NOT SACRIFICE YOUR OWN CONVENIENCE AND PLEASURE BY STAYING THROUGH THAT INTERVAL WITH YOUR FRIENDS AT SAINT CRUX IF BEFORE MY RETURN SOME UNEXPECTED CIRCUMSTANCE THROWS YOU ONCE MORE INTO THE COMPANY OF THE BYGRAVES
4216-10192-0026 AND IF YOUR NATURAL KINDNESS OF HEART INCLINES YOU TO RECEIVE THE EXCUSES WHICH THEY WILL IN THAT CASE CERTAINLY ADDRESS TO YOU PLACE ONE TRIFLING RESTRAINT ON YOURSELF FOR YOUR OWN SAKE IF NOT FOR MINE SUSPEND YOUR FLIRTATION WITH THE YOUNG LADY
4216-10192-0027 I WILL ENGAGE TO LEAVE YOUR SERVICE AT A DAY'S NOTICE AND I WILL ATONE FOR THE SIN OF BEARING FALSE WITNESS AGAINST MY NEIGHBOR BY RESIGNING
4216-10192-0028 ON YOUR FATHER'S ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ON YOUR OWN I MAKE THIS ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT RESERVES OF ANY KIND AND I PROMISE TO ABIDE BY
4216-10192-0029 ON THE FAITH OF A GOOD CATHOLIC AND THE WORD OF AN HONEST WOMAN YOUR FAITHFUL SERVANT VIRGINIE LECOUNT THE CLOSING SENTENCES OF THIS LETTER AS THE HOUSEKEEPER WELL KNEW
4216-10192-0030 AND HAVE FAILED TO LEAVE A PERMANENT IMPRESSION ON HIS MIND BUT WHEN SHE STAKED NOT ONLY HER POSITION IN HIS SERVICE BUT HER PECUNIARY CLAIMS ON HIM AS WELL SHE AT ONCE ABSORBED THE RULING PASSION OF HIS LIFE
4216-10192-0031 RECOVERED HIS ASTONISHMENT AT THE HOUSEKEEPER'S APPEARANCE ON HIS OWN PREMISES HE HURRIED INTO THE HOUSE
4216-10192-0032 THAN MAGDALEN'S INCORRIGIBLE IMPATIENCE SHE HAD PASSED A SLEEPLESS NIGHT SHE HAD RISEN FEVERISH AND WRETCHED AND SHE HAD GONE OUT RECKLESS OF ALL CONSEQUENCES TO COOL HER BURNING HEAD IN THE FRESH AIR IN THE SECOND PLACE
4216-10192-0033 MISSUS WRAGGE HAD ON HER OWN CONFESSION SEEN MISSUS LECOUNT HAD TALKED WITH
4216-10192-0034 COMMANDED AN UNINTERRUPTED PROSPECT OF NOEL VANSTONE'S HOUSE AND THERE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF ON THE WATCH
4216-10192-0035 ON THE WATCH FOR EVENTS AT NORTH SHINGLES
4216-10192-0036 THE COACH APPEARED AT LAST AND DREW UP AT SEA VIEW IN A MINUTE MORE CAPTAIN WRAGGE'S OWN OBSERVATION INFORMED HIM THAT ONE AMONG THE PASSENGERS WHO LEFT ALDBOROUGH THAT MORNING WAS MISSUS LECOUNT
4216-10192-0037 THAT SHE WOULD CERTAINLY INFORM HER MASTER OF MISSUS WRAGGE'S GHOST STORY AND OF EVERY OTHER DISCLOSURE IN RELATION TO NAMES AND PLACES WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED MISSUS WRAGGE'S LIPS WAS BEYOND ALL DOUBT
4216-10192-0038 BUT OF THE TWO WAYS AT HER DISPOSAL OF DOING THE MISCHIEF EITHER PERSONALLY OR BY LETTER IT WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE CAPTAIN TO KNOW WHICH SHE HAD CHOSEN IF SHE HAD GONE TO THE ADMIRAL'S NO CHOICE WOULD BE LEFT HIM
4216-10192-0039 BUT TO FOLLOW THE COACH TO CATCH THE TRAIN BY WHICH SHE TRAVELED AND TO OUTSTRIP HER AFTERWARD ON THE DRIVE FROM THE STATION IN ESSEX TO SAINT CRUX IF ON THE CONTRARY
4216-10192-0040 IT WOULD ONLY BE NECESSARY TO DEVISE MEASURES FOR INTERCEPTING THE LETTER THE CAPTAIN DECIDED ON GOING TO THE POST OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE ASSUMING THAT THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD WRITTEN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT THE LETTER AT THE MERCY OF THE SERVANT
4216-10192-0041 SHE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT SAFELY IN THE LETTER BOX BEFORE LEAVING ALDBOROUGH
