1417-1539-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MAN AT THE ASTOR THE DUTIES OF MASTER PUGSY MALONEY AT THE OFFICES OF COSY MOMENTS WERE NOT HEAVY AND HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO OCCUPY HIS LARGE STORE OF LEISURE BY READING NARRATIVES DEALING WITH LIFE IN THE PRAIRIES
1417-1539-0001 IT WAS WHILE HE WAS ENGROSSED IN ONE OF THESE ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING THE VISIT OF MISTER PARKER THAT THE SEEDY LOOKING MAN MADE HIS APPEARANCE HE WALKED IN FROM THE STREET AND STOOD BEFORE MASTER MALONEY HEY KID HE SAID
1417-1539-0002 HE RESENTED BEING ADDRESSED AS KID BY PERFECT STRANGERS EDITOR IN TOMMY INQUIRED THE MAN PUGSY BY THIS TIME HAD TAKEN A THOROUGH DISLIKE TO HIM TO BE CALLED KID WAS BAD THE SUBTLE INSULT OF TOMMY WAS STILL WORSE NOPE

1417-1539-0004 THE MAN EYED HIM WITH DISPLEASURE FRESH KID HE OBSERVED DISAPPROVINGLY FADE AWAY URGED MASTER MALONEY
1417-1539-0005 SINCE TIME BEGAN SMALL BOYS IN EVERY COUNTRY HAVE HAD BUT ONE ANSWER FOR THIS ACTION PUGSY MADE IT HE EMITTED A PIERCING SQUEAL IN WHICH PAIN FEAR AND RESENTMENT STROVE FOR SUPREMACY THE NOISE PENETRATED INTO THE EDITORIAL SANCTUM
1417-1539-0006 LOSING ONLY A SMALL PART OF ITS STRENGTH ON THE WAY PSMITH
1417-1539-0007 A BOOK OF POETRY LOOKED UP WITH PATIENT SADNESS
1417-1539-0008 CONCENTRATED THOUGHT WILL BE OUT OF THE QUESTION A SECOND SQUEAL RENT THE AIR BILLY WINDSOR JUMPED UP SOMEBODY MUST BE HURTING THE KID HE EXCLAIMED HE HURRIED TO THE DOOR AND FLUNG IT OPEN PSMITH FOLLOWED AT A MORE LEISURELY PACE
1417-1539-0009 THE SEEDY MAN CAUGHT IN THE ACT RELEASED MASTER MALONEY WHO STOOD RUBBING HIS EAR WITH RESENTMENT WRITTEN ON EVERY FEATURE ON SUCH OCCASIONS AS THIS BILLY WAS A MAN OF FEW WORDS HE MADE A DIVE FOR THE SEEDY MAN
1417-1539-0010 BUT THE LATTER WHO DURING THE PRECEDING MOMENT HAD BEEN EYEING THE TWO EDITORS AS IF HE WERE COMMITTING THEIR APPEARANCE TO MEMORY
1417-1539-0011 COMRADE MALONEY SAID PSMITH YOU ARE A MARTYR WHAT WOULD HORATIUS HAVE DONE IF SOMEBODY HAD NIPPED HIM BY THE EAR WHEN HE WAS HOLDING THE BRIDGE
1417-1539-0012 NOPE JUST TRIED TO BUTT T'ROO ANOTHER OF THESE STRONG SILENT MEN THE WORLD IS FULL OF US THESE ARE THE PERILS OF THE JOURNALISTIC LIFE YOU WILL BE SAFER AND HAPPIER WHEN YOU ARE ROUNDING UP COWS ON YOUR MUSTANG

1417-1539-0017 AND I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO THE SAME IT WAS BY PSMITH'S SUGGESTION THAT THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF COSY MOMENTS DINED THAT NIGHT IN THE ROOF GARDEN AT THE TOP OF THE ASTOR HOTEL THE TIRED BRAIN HE SAID NEEDS TO RECUPERATE
1417-1539-0018 TO FEED ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS IN SOME LOW DOWN HOSTELRY ON THE LEVEL OF THE STREET WITH GERMAN WAITERS BREATHING HEAVILY DOWN THE BACK OF ONE'S NECK AND TWO FIDDLES AND A PIANO WHACKING OUT BEAUTIFUL EYES ABOUT THREE FEET FROM ONE'S TYMPANUM WOULD BE FALSE ECONOMY
