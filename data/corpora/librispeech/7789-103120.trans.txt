7789-103120-0000 I LEARNED THE LITTLE TALE FROM AN OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN THE VALLEY OF THE CONNECTICUT WHICH THE INDIANS CALLED THE LONG RIVER OF PINES WITH THIS VERY SHORT PREFACE AUNT ELINOR BEGAN TO READ IN HER BEST MANNER THE STORY OF ONAWANDAH
7789-103120-0001 LONG AGO WHEN HOSTILE INDIANS HAUNTED THE GREAT FORESTS AND EVERY SETTLEMENT HAD ITS FORT FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INHABITANTS IN ONE OF THE TOWNS ON THE CONNECTICUT RIVER LIVED PARSON BAIN AND HIS LITTLE SON AND DAUGHTER
7789-103120-0002 THE WIFE AND MOTHER WAS DEAD BUT AN OLD SERVANT TOOK CARE OF THEM AND DID HER BEST TO MAKE REUBEN AND EUNICE GOOD CHILDREN HER DIREST THREAT WHEN THEY WERE NAUGHTY WAS THE INDIANS WILL COME AND FETCH YOU IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE
7789-103120-0003 SO THEY GREW UP IN GREAT FEAR OF THE RED MEN EVEN THE FRIENDLY INDIANS WHO SOMETIMES CAME FOR FOOD OR POWDER WERE REGARDED WITH SUSPICION BY THE PEOPLE NO MAN WENT TO WORK WITHOUT HIS GUN NEAR BY
7789-103120-0004 ON SUNDAYS WHEN THEY TRUDGED TO THE RUDE MEETING HOUSE ALL CARRIED THE TRUSTY RIFLE ON THE SHOULDER AND WHILE THE PASTOR PREACHED A SENTINEL MOUNTED GUARD AT THE DOOR TO GIVE WARNING IF CANOES CAME DOWN THE RIVER OR A DARK FACE PEERED FROM THE WOOD
7789-103120-0005 ONE AUTUMN NIGHT WHEN THE FIRST HEAVY RAINS WERE FALLING AND A COLD WIND WHISTLED THROUGH THE VALLEY A KNOCK CAME AT THE MINISTER'S DOOR AND OPENING IT HE FOUND AN INDIAN BOY RAGGED HUNGRY AND FOOT SORE WHO BEGGED FOR FOOD AND SHELTER
7789-103120-0006 IN HIS BROKEN WAY HE TOLD HOW HE HAD FALLEN ILL AND BEEN LEFT TO DIE BY ENEMIES WHO HAD TAKEN HIM FROM HIS OWN PEOPLE MONTHS BEFORE
7789-103120-0007 HOW HE HAD WANDERED FOR DAYS TILL ALMOST SINKING AND THAT HE HAD COME NOW TO ASK FOR HELP LED BY THE HOSPITABLE LIGHT IN THE PARSONAGE WINDOW SEND HIM AWAY MASTER OR HARM WILL COME OF IT HE IS A SPY
7789-103120-0008 AND WE SHALL ALL BE SCALPED BY THE MURDERING INJUNS WHO ARE WAITING IN THE WOOD SAID OLD BECKY HARSHLY WHILE LITTLE EUNICE HID IN THE OLD SERVANT'S AMPLE SKIRTS AND TWELVE YEAR OLD REUBEN LAID HIS HAND ON HIS CROSS BOW READY TO DEFEND HIS SISTER IF NEED BE
7789-103120-0009 BUT THE GOOD MAN DREW THE POOR LAD IN SAYING WITH HIS FRIENDLY SMILE SHALL NOT A CHRISTIAN BE AS HOSPITABLE AS A GODLESS SAVAGE COME IN CHILD AND BE FED YOU SORELY NEED REST AND SHELTER
7789-103120-0010 LEAVING HIS FACE TO EXPRESS THE GRATITUDE HE HAD NO WORDS TO TELL THE BOY SAT BY THE COMFORTABLE FIRE AND ATE LIKE A FAMISHED WOLF WHILE BECKY MUTTERED HER FOREBODINGS AND THE CHILDREN EYED THE DARK YOUTH AT A SAFE DISTANCE
7789-103120-0011 SOMETHING IN HIS PINCHED FACE WOUNDED FOOT AND EYES FULL OF DUMB PAIN AND PATIENCE TOUCHED THE LITTLE GIRL'S TENDER HEART AND YIELDING TO A PITIFUL IMPULSE SHE BROUGHT HER OWN BASIN OF NEW MILK AND SETTING IT BESIDE THE STRANGER
7789-103120-0012 RAN TO HIDE BEHIND HER FATHER SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE DREADED INDIANS THAT WAS WELL DONE LITTLE DAUGHTER THOU SHALT LOVE THINE ENEMIES AND SHARE THY BREAD WITH THE NEEDY SEE HE IS SMILING
7789-103120-0013 THAT PLEASED HIM AND HE WISHES US TO BE HIS FRIENDS BUT EUNICE VENTURED NO MORE THAT NIGHT AND QUAKED IN HER LITTLE BED AT THE THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE BOY SLEEPING ON A BLANKET BEFORE THE FIRE BELOW REUBEN HID HIS FEARS BETTER AND RESOLVED TO WATCH WHILE OTHERS SLEPT
7789-103120-0014 BUT WAS OFF AS SOON AS HIS CURLY HEAD TOUCHED THE PILLOW AND DREAMED OF TOMAHAWKS AND WAR WHOOPS TILL MORNING NEXT DAY NEIGHBORS CAME TO SEE THE WAIF AND ONE AND ALL ADVISED SENDING HIM AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SINCE HE WAS DOUBTLESS A SPY AS BECKY SAID
7789-103120-0015 AND WOULD BRING TROUBLE OF SOME SORT WHEN HE IS WELL HE MAY GO WHITHERSOEVER HE WILL BUT WHILE HE IS TOO LAME TO WALK WEAK WITH HUNGER AND WORN OUT WITH WEARINESS I WILL HARBOR HIM HE CANNOT FEIGN SUFFERING AND STARVATION LIKE THIS
7789-103120-0016 I SHALL DO MY DUTY AND LEAVE THE CONSEQUENCES TO THE LORD ANSWERED THE PARSON WITH SUCH PIOUS FIRMNESS THAT THE NEIGHBORS SAID NO MORE BUT THEY KEPT A CLOSE WATCH UPON ONAWANDAH WHEN HE WENT AMONG THEM SILENT AND SUBMISSIVE
7789-103120-0017 BUT WITH THE PROUD AIR OF A CAPTIVE PRINCE AND SOMETIMES A FIERCE FLASH IN HIS BLACK EYES WHEN THE OTHER LADS TAUNTED HIM WITH HIS RED SKIN HE WAS VERY LAME FOR WEEKS AND COULD ONLY SIT IN THE SUN WEAVING PRETTY BASKETS FOR EUNICE AND SHAPING BOWS AND ARROWS FOR REUBEN
7789-103120-0018 THE CHILDREN WERE SOON HIS FRIENDS FOR WITH THEM HE WAS ALWAYS GENTLE TRYING IN HIS SOFT LANGUAGE AND EXPRESSIVE GESTURES TO SHOW HIS GOOD WILL AND GRATITUDE FOR THEY DEFENDED HIM AGAINST THEIR RUDER PLAYMATES AND FOLLOWING THEIR FATHER'S EXAMPLE TRUSTED AND CHERISHED THE HOMELESS YOUTH
7789-103120-0019 WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO WALK HE TAUGHT THE BOY TO SHOOT AND TRAP THE WILD CREATURES OF THE WOOD TO FIND FISH WHERE OTHERS FAILED AND TO GUIDE HIMSELF IN THE WILDERNESS BY STAR AND SUN WIND AND WATER
7789-103120-0020 TO EUNICE HE BROUGHT LITTLE OFFERINGS OF BARK AND FEATHERS TAUGHT HER TO MAKE MOCCASINS OF SKIN BELTS OF SHELLS OR POUCHES GAY WITH PORCUPINE QUILLS AND COLORED GRASS HE WOULD NOT WORK FOR OLD BECKY WHO PLAINLY SHOWED HER DISTRUST SAYING
7789-103120-0021 A BRAVE DOES NOT GRIND CORN AND BRING WOOD THAT IS SQUAW'S WORK ONAWANDAH WILL HUNT AND FISH AND FIGHT FOR YOU BUT NO MORE AND EVEN THE REQUEST OF THE PARSON COULD NOT WIN OBEDIENCE IN THIS THOUGH THE BOY WOULD HAVE DIED FOR THE GOOD MAN
7789-103120-0022 WE CAN NOT TAME AN EAGLE AS WE CAN A BARNYARD FOWL LET HIM REMEMBER ONLY KINDNESS OF US AND SO WE TURN A FOE INTO A FRIEND SAID PARSON BAIN STROKING THE SLEEK DARK HEAD THAT ALWAYS BOWED BEFORE HIM
7789-103120-0023 WITH A DOCILE REVERENCE SHOWN TO NO OTHER LIVING CREATURE WINTER CAME AND THE SETTLERS FARED HARDLY THROUGH THE LONG MONTHS WHEN THE DRIFTS ROSE TO THE EAVES OF THEIR LOW CABINS AND THE STORES CAREFULLY HARVESTED FAILED TO SUPPLY EVEN THEIR SIMPLE WANTS
7789-103120-0024 BUT THE MINISTER'S FAMILY NEVER LACKED WILD MEAT FOR ONAWANDAH PROVED HIMSELF A BETTER HUNTER THAN ANY MAN IN THE TOWN AND THE BOY OF SIXTEEN LED THE WAY ON HIS SNOW SHOES WHEN THEY WENT TO TRACK A BEAR TO ITS DEN CHASE THE DEER FOR MILES
7789-103120-0025 OR SHOOT THE WOLVES THAT HOWLED ABOUT THEIR HOMES IN THE WINTER NIGHTS BUT HE NEVER JOINED IN THEIR GAMES AND SAT APART WHEN THE YOUNG FOLK MADE MERRY AS IF HE SCORNED SUCH CHILDISH PASTIMES AND LONGED TO BE A MAN IN ALL THINGS WHY HE STAYED WHEN HE WAS WELL AGAIN NO ONE COULD TELL
7789-103120-0026 UNLESS HE WAITED FOR SPRING TO MAKE HIS WAY TO HIS OWN PEOPLE BUT REUBEN AND EUNICE REJOICED TO KEEP HIM FOR WHILE HE TAUGHT THEM MANY THINGS HE WAS THEIR PUPIL ALSO LEARNING ENGLISH RAPIDLY AND PROVING HIMSELF A VERY AFFECTIONATE AND DEVOTED FRIEND AND SERVANT IN HIS OWN QUIET WAY
7789-103120-0027 BE OF GOOD CHEER LITTLE DAUGHTER I SHALL BE GONE BUT THREE DAYS AND OUR BRAVE ONAWANDAH WILL GUARD YOU WELL SAID THE PARSON ONE APRIL MORNING AS HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE TO VISIT A DISTANT SETTLEMENT WHERE THE BITTER WINTER HAD BROUGHT SICKNESS AND DEATH TO MORE THAN ONE HOUSEHOLD
7789-103120-0028 THE BOY SHOWED HIS WHITE TEETH IN A BRIGHT SMILE AS HE STOOD BESIDE THE CHILDREN
7789-103120-0029 I HOPE YOU MAYN'T FIND YOU'VE WARMED A VIPER IN YOUR BOSOM MASTER TWO DAYS LATER IT SEEMED AS IF BECKY WAS A TRUE PROPHET AND THAT THE CONFIDING MINISTER HAD BEEN TERRIBLY DECEIVED FOR ONAWANDAH WENT AWAY TO HUNT
7789-103120-0030 AND THAT NIGHT THE AWFUL WAR WHOOP WOKE THE SLEEPING VILLAGERS TO FIND THEIR HOUSES BURNING WHILE THE HIDDEN INDIANS SHOT AT THEM BY THE LIGHT OF THE FIRES KINDLED BY DUSKY SCOUTS IN TERROR AND CONFUSION THE WHITES FLEW TO THE FORT
7789-103120-0031 AND WHILE THE MEN FOUGHT BRAVELY THE WOMEN HELD BLANKETS TO CATCH ARROWS AND BULLETS OR BOUND UP THE HURTS OF THEIR DEFENDERS IT WAS ALL OVER BY DAYLIGHT AND THE RED MEN SPED AWAY UP THE RIVER WITH SEVERAL PRISONERS AND SUCH BOOTY AS THEY COULD PLUNDER FROM THE DESERTED HOUSES
7789-103120-0032 NOT TILL ALL FEAR OF A RETURN OF THEIR ENEMIES WAS OVER DID THE POOR PEOPLE VENTURE TO LEAVE THE FORT AND SEEK THEIR RUINED HOMES THEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT BECKY AND THE PARSON'S CHILDREN WERE GONE AND GREAT WAS THE BEWAILING
7789-103120-0033 FOR THE GOOD MAN WAS MUCH BELOVED BY ALL HIS FLOCK SUDDENLY THE SMOTHERED VOICE OF BECKY WAS HEARD BY A PARTY OF VISITORS CALLING DOLEFULLY I AM HERE BETWIXT THE BEDS PULL ME OUT NEIGHBORS FOR I AM HALF DEAD WITH FRIGHT AND SMOTHERING
7789-103120-0034 THE OLD WOMAN WAS QUICKLY EXTRICATED FROM HER HIDING PLACE AND WITH MUCH ENERGY DECLARED THAT SHE HAD SEEN ONAWANDAH DISGUISED WITH WAR PAINT AMONG THE INDIANS AND THAT HE HAD TORN AWAY THE CHILDREN FROM HER ARMS BEFORE SHE COULD FLY FROM THE HOUSE
7789-103120-0035 HE CHOSE HIS TIME WELL WHEN THEY WERE DEFENCELESS DEAR LAMBS SPITE OF ALL MY WARNINGS MASTER TRUSTED HIM AND THIS IS THE THANKS WE GET OH MY POOR MASTER HOW CAN I TELL HIM THIS HEAVY NEWS
7789-103120-0036 THERE WAS NO NEED TO TELL IT FOR AS BECKY SAT MOANING AND BEATING HER BREAST ON THE FIRELESS HEARTH AND THE SYMPATHIZING NEIGHBORS STOOD ABOUT HER THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S HOOFS WAS HEARD AND THE PARSON CAME DOWN THE HILLY ROAD LIKE ONE RIDING FOR HIS LIFE
7789-103120-0037 HE HAD SEEN THE SMOKE AFAR OFF GUESSED THE SAD TRUTH AND HURRIED ON TO FIND HIS HOME IN RUINS AND TO LEARN BY HIS FIRST GLANCE AT THE FACES AROUND HIM THAT HIS CHILDREN WERE GONE WHEN HE HAD HEARD ALL THERE WAS TO TELL
7789-103120-0038 HE SAT DOWN UPON HIS DOOR STONE WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS PRAYING FOR STRENGTH TO BEAR A GRIEF TOO DEEP FOR WORDS THE WOUNDED AND WEARY MEN TRIED TO COMFORT HIM WITH HOPE
7789-103120-0039 SUDDENLY A STIR WENT THROUGH THE MOURNFUL GROUP AS ONAWANDAH CAME FROM THE WOOD WITH A YOUNG DEER UPON HIS SHOULDERS AND AMAZEMENT IN HIS FACE AS HE SAW THE DESOLATION BEFORE HIM DROPPING HIS BURDEN HE STOOD AN INSTANT LOOKING WITH EYES THAT KINDLED FIERCELY
7789-103120-0040 THEN HE CAME BOUNDING TOWARD THEM UNDAUNTED BY THE HATRED SUSPICION AND SURPRISE PLAINLY WRITTEN ON THE COUNTENANCES BEFORE HIM HE MISSED HIS PLAYMATES AND ASKED BUT ONE QUESTION THE BOY THE LITTLE SQUAW WHERE GONE
7789-103120-0041 HIS ANSWER WAS A ROUGH ONE FOR THE MEN SEIZED HIM AND POURED FORTH THE TALE HEAPING REPROACHES UPON HIM FOR SUCH TREACHERY AND INGRATITUDE HE BORE IT ALL IN PROUD SILENCE TILL THEY POINTED TO THE POOR FATHER
7789-103120-0042 WHOSE DUMB SORROW WAS MORE ELOQUENT THAN ALL THEIR WRATH ONAWANDAH LOOKED AT HIM AND THE FIRE DIED OUT OF HIS EYES AS IF QUENCHED BY THE TEARS HE WOULD NOT SHED SHAKING OFF THE HANDS THAT HELD HIM HE WENT TO HIS GOOD FRIEND SAYING WITH PASSIONATE EARNESTNESS ONAWANDAH IS NOT TRAITOR
7789-103120-0043 ONAWANDAH REMEMBERS ONAWANDAH GRATEFUL YOU BELIEVE THE POOR PARSON LOOKED UP AT HIM AND COULD NOT DOUBT HIS TRUTH FOR GENUINE LOVE AND SORROW ENNOBLED THE DARK FACE AND HE HAD NEVER KNOWN THE BOY TO LIE
7789-103120-0044 I BELIEVE AND TRUST YOU STILL BUT OTHERS WILL NOT GO YOU ARE NO LONGER SAFE HERE AND I HAVE NO HOME TO OFFER YOU SAID THE PARSON SADLY FEELING THAT HE CARED FOR NONE UNLESS HIS CHILDREN WERE RESTORED TO HIM ONAWANDAH HAS NO FEAR
7789-103120-0045 HE GOES BUT HE COMES AGAIN TO BRING THE BOY THE LITTLE SQUAW FEW WORDS BUT THEY WERE SO SOLEMNLY SPOKEN THAT THE MOST UNBELIEVING WERE IMPRESSED FOR THE YOUTH LAID ONE HAND ON THE GRAY HEAD BOWED BEFORE HIM AND LIFTED THE OTHER TOWARD HEAVEN
7789-103120-0046 AS IF CALLING THE GREAT SPIRIT TO HEAR HIS VOW A RELENTING MURMUR WENT THROUGH THE CROWD BUT THE BOY PAID NO HEED AS HE TURNED AWAY AND WITH NO ARMS BUT HIS HUNTING KNIFE AND BOW NO FOOD BUT SUCH AS HE COULD FIND
7789-103120-0047 NO GUIDE BUT THE SUN BY DAY THE STARS BY NIGHT PLUNGED INTO THE PATHLESS FOREST AND WAS GONE THEN THE PEOPLE DREW A LONG BREATH AND MUTTERED TO ONE ANOTHER HE WILL NEVER DO IT YET HE IS A BRAVE LAD FOR HIS YEARS
