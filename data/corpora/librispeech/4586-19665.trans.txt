4586-19665-0001 THAN WE HAVE EVER KNOWN MISTER WALCOT'S CARE WILL BE NEW LIFE TO US WHOSE CARE MISTER WALCOT'S WE BROUGHT HIM WITH US LAST NIGHT
4586-19665-0002 NOW THAT SHE WILL BE IN GOOD HANDS I SHALL FEEL THAT I HAVE DONE MY DUTY AND PRAY DOES ROWLAND KNOW OF YOUR HAVING BROUGHT THIS STRANGER HERE OF COURSE MISTER WALCOT IS OUR GUEST TILL HIS OWN HOUSE CAN BE PREPARED FOR HIM
4586-19665-0003 OR YOU HAVE MISINFORMED HIM OF THE TRUE STATE OF AFFAIRS HERE I SUSPECT THE LATTER TO BE THE CASE
4586-19665-0004 NOT ONE OF MISSUS ROWLAND'S PREPARED ANSWERS WOULD SUIT IN THIS PLACE BEFORE SHE COULD THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY
4586-19665-0005 BUT IT IS YOUR OWN DOING MISTER HOPE MUST HAVE JUSTICE AND YOU HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF THAT JUSTICE MUST BE DONE AT YOUR EXPENSE I GIVE YOU FAIR NOTICE THAT I SHALL DISCHARGE MY DUTY FULLY IN THE PAINFUL CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH YOU HAVE CONTRIVED
4586-19665-0006 ALL DEERBROOK WILL THANK ME IGNORANT AND STUPID AS DEERBROOK IS ABOUT MANY THINGS
4586-19665-0007 YOU KNOW THAT HOPE IS AN ABLE AND MOST HUMANE MAN IN HIS PROFESSION AND THAT HE DOES NOT STEAL DEAD BODIES YOU KNOW THE FALSEHOOD OF THE WHOLE SET OF VULGAR STORIES
4586-19665-0008 THAT YOU HAVE PUT INTO CIRCULATION AGAINST HIM YOU KNOW ALSO THAT MY MOTHER HAS ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND THAT IT WILL GO NEAR TO BREAK HER HEART TO HAVE HIM DISMISSED FOR ANY ONE ELSE THIS IS THE MEANING OF WHAT I SAY
4586-19665-0009 AS FOR WHAT I MEAN TO DO IT IS THIS I SHALL SPEAK TO MISTER WALCOT AT ONCE BEFORE HIS INTENTION TO SETTLE HERE IS KNOWN YOU ARE TOO LATE MY DEAR SIR EVERY ONE IN DEERBROOK KNOWS IT AS WELL AS IF DOCTOR LEVITT WAS TO GIVE NOTICE OF IT FROM THE PULPIT TO DAY
4586-19665-0010 SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU PRISCILLA I SHALL EXPLAIN THE WHOLE OF HOPE'S CASE TO MISTER WALCOT AVOIDING IF POSSIBLE ALL EXPOSURE OF YOU OH PRAY DO NOT DISTURB YOURSELF ABOUT THAT MISTER WALCOT KNOWS ME VERY WELL I AM NOT AFRAID
4586-19665-0011 BUT NOT SHRINKING FROM THE FULL STATEMENT OF THE FACTS IF THAT SHOULD PROVE NECESSARY TO HOPE'S JUSTIFICATION IF THIS GENTLEMAN BE HONOURABLE HE WILL DECLINE ATTENDING MY MOTHER AND GO AWAY MORE WILLINGLY THAN HE CAME
4586-19665-0012 IS THE KINDEST WHICH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES CAN BE ENTERTAINED TOWARDS YOU SISTER I DO IT IN THE HOPE THAT BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
4586-19665-0013 LEAVING YOU OPPORTUNITY TO RETRIEVE YOURSELF TO REPAIR THE MISCHIEF YOU HAVE DONE AND TO ALLEVIATE THE MISERY WHICH I SEE IS COMING UPON YOU YOU ARE VERY GOOD BUT I KNOW WHAT I AM ABOUT AND I SHALL PROCEED IN MY OWN WAY
4586-19665-0014 AND KNOWN BY YOU TO BE SO
4586-19665-0015 IS A BAD SYMPTOM PRISCILLA A SYMPTOM OF A MALADY WHICH NEITHER HOPE NOR MISTER WALCOT NOR ANY ONE BUT YOURSELF CAN CURE I WOULD HAVE YOU LOOK TO IT
4586-19665-0016 I SAID SO BECAUSE IT IS TRUE
4586-19665-0017 WHICH IS JUST THE SAME THING I MEAN THAT IT SHALL BE TRUE I HAVE SET MY HEART UPON YOUR MARRYING AND UPON YOUR MARRYING MARY BRUCE I KNOW SHE WOULD LIKE IT AND STOP THERE NOT ANOTHER WORD ABOUT MISS BRUCE

4586-19665-0022 YOU HAVE POWER OF MIND TO DO THIS THE VERY FORCE WITH WHICH YOU PERSIST IN PERSECUTING THEM SHOWS THAT YOU HAVE POWER FOR BETTER THINGS
4586-19665-0023 DO BUT TRY THANK YOU I AM GLAD YOU ARE AWARE OF MY POWER IF THEY FORGIVE ME FOR ANYTHING IT SHALL BE FOR MY POWER THAT IS NOT FOR YOU TO DETERMINE HAPPILY TO WHAT EXTENT THEY FORGIVE IS BETWEEN GOD AND THEMSELVES

4586-19665-0026 IS BUT THE REACTION OF YOUR INTERNAL SUFFERING FROM WITNESSING THE RESULTS OF YOUR INFLUENCE IN THE OUTRAGES OF LAST NIGHT CONFIDE THIS TO ME NOW AND GIVE YOURSELF SUCH EASE AS YOU YET CAN THANK YOU
4586-19665-0027 AND IT PROVED TO MISTER WALCOT AS I OBSERVED TO HIM AT THE TIME HOW MUCH HE WAS WANTED HERE NOW IF YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO ME I MUST GO I SHALL DENY YOUR ENGAGEMENT EVERYWHERE
4586-19665-0028 AND RETURNED HIM A STARE WHICH LASTED TILL SHE REACHED THE DOOR THERE IS SOMETHING ALMOST SUBLIME IN AUDACITY LIKE THIS THOUGHT HE BUT IT CANNOT LAST IT COMES FROM INTERNAL TORTURE A THING AS NECESSARILY TEMPORARY AS FAITH
