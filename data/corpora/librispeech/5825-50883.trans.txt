5825-50883-0000 THOUGH THE HERD HAVE FLED FROM THEE THY HOME IS STILL HERE HERE IS THE SMILE THAT NO CLOUD CAN O'ERCAST AND A HEART AND A HAND ALL THY OWN TO THE LAST MOORE
5825-50883-0001 AND KINDLY FACES WERE BENDING OVER HIM HE WAS CONSCIOUS FROM THE FIRST OF AN OPPRESSIVE WEIGHT OF TROUBLE BUT COULD NOT REALIZE WHAT HAD OCCURRED AS ONE AWAKENING FROM A TROUBLED DREAM HE STROVE TO GATHER UP HIS SCATTERED FACULTIES
5825-50883-0002 AND RECALL WHAT HAD HAPPENED LIKE A BLAST OF DOOM THE AWFUL TRUTH BURST UPON HIM AND HE LEAPED TO HIS FEET HE WAS AT THE HOME OF LANDLORD NURSE AND THE PALE SAD HORROR STRICKEN FACES ABOUT HIM
5825-50883-0003 WERE THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS THEY CAUGHT CHARLES BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOOR MY MOTHER CRIED THE YOUNG MAN NO YOU CAN DO HER NO GOOD BY AN ACT OF RASHNESS
5825-50883-0004 JOHN NURSE ANSWERED TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I WILL SIT HERE AND LISTEN TO IT ALL SAID CHARLES WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT HE COULD NOT BREAK AWAY FROM HIS FRIENDS YOUR MOTHER AND CORA WATERS HAVE BOTH BEEN CRIED OUT UPON AS WITCHES
5825-50883-0005 WARRANTS WERE ISSUED AND THEY WERE ARRESTED NOW COLLECT YOUR FACULTIES AND ACT ON YOUR COOLEST JUDGMENT THINK WHAT YOU WILL DO
5825-50883-0006 CHARLES STEVENS BOWED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND REFLECTED LONG AND EARNESTLY ON THE COURSE TO PURSUE HE RECALLED THE WORDS OF ORACUS THE BRAVE YOUNG CHIEF WHO COULD MUSTER A HUNDRED WARRIORS
5825-50883-0007 HE WAS CUNNING AND MIGHT DEVISE SOME PLAN OF ESCAPE AND CHARLES WAS NOT LONG IN RESOLVING WHAT TO DO HE WOULD NOT ACT HURRIEDLY HE WOULD BE DESPERATE BUT THAT DESPERATION WOULD HAVE COOLNESS AND PREMEDITATION ABOUT IT
5825-50883-0008 HE PROMISED HIS FRIENDS TO BE CALM
5825-50883-0009 AND THEN BEGUN SEEKING AN INTERVIEW WITH HIS MOTHER AND CORA IT WAS THREE DAYS BEFORE THE INTERVIEW WAS GRANTED HE FOUND THEM OCCUPYING LOATHSOME CELLS EACH CHAINED TO THE WALL THE INTERVIEW WAS LONG
5825-50883-0010 AND JUST WHAT SUCH AN INTERVIEW COULD BE FULL OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR CHARLES TRIED TO HOPE HE TRIED TO SEE A RAY OF SUNLIGHT
5825-50883-0011 BUT THE EFFORT ONLY REVEALED THE SWAYING FORMS OF THOSE HUNG ON WITCHES HILL EVEN IF HE SUMMONED ORACUS AND ALL HIS BRAVES WOULD THEY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK DOWN THAT DOOR OF IRON OR CUT THE CHAINS ASUNDER
5825-50883-0012 CHARLES IN HIS DESPERATION RESOLVED TO RESCUE THE BELOVED ONES OR DIE IN THE EFFORT HE WENT AWAY WEEPING HE DID NOT RETURN HOME THAT HOME WAS DESOLATE LONELY
5825-50883-0013 FOR CHARLES WAS DETERMINED TO MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH OR RESCUE HIS MOTHER AND CORA BUT HE DID NOT DEPEND ON THOSE DISTANT RELATIVES AND FRIENDS SO MUCH AS THE DUSKY FRIENDS IN THE FOREST
5825-50883-0014 OR WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN HIS EFFORTS EVEN IF HE SHOULD BE KILLED IN AN ABORTIVE ATTEMPT HOWEVER HE HOPED THAT HIS RELATIVES WOULD RESUME THE WARFARE FOR THE PRISONERS
5825-50883-0015 COULD I BUT FIND THE WATERS BROTHERS I WOULD HAVE TWO FRIENDS AND ALLIES TO AID ME OH HEAVEN GIVE ME LIGHT GIVE ME LIGHT
5825-50883-0016 CHARLES STEVENS LIKE ALL TRUE CHRISTIANS IN THIS DARK HOUR WENT TO GOD FOR AID KNEELING HE PRAYED AS HE HAD NEVER PRAYED BEFORE HE SEEMED TO TAKE HOLD OF THE THRONE OF GRACE
5825-50883-0017 AND WITH A FAITH STRENGTHENED AND RENEWED DREW INSPIRATION FOR HIS DESPERATE RESOLVE FROM THE ONLY LIVING FOUNTAIN ARMED WITH HIS RIFLE AND PISTOLS HE LEFT THE VILLAGE AND WENT INTO THE FOREST
5825-50883-0018 THE MOSS AND FERNS AND COOL SHADES SEEM TO BREATHE OF ETERNITY CHARLES STEVENS HAD ALWAYS LOVED THE DARK OLD WOODS AND NEVER HAD THEY SEEMED SO FRIENDLY AS ON THIS OCCASION WHEN THEY SCREENED HIM FROM THE FROWNS OF MAN
5825-50883-0019 SOLITUDE OFFERED HIM ITS CHARMS THE ZEPHYRS SOUGHT TO SOOTHE HIS SORROWS BY THEIR GENTLE WHISPERS AND THE BIRDS SANG FOR THE PEACE OF HIS TROUBLED SPIRIT WHILE THE BABBLING BROOKS STROVE TO MAKE HIM GAY
5825-50883-0020 BUT WHO CAN BE GAY WHEN LOVED ONES ARE MENACED WITH A TERRIBLE DANGER CHARLES STEVENS SAW LITTLE OF THE BEAUTY OF NATURE HIS EYES WERE SEARCHING THE FORESTS FOR DUSKY FORMS WHICH HE HOPED TO MEET
5825-50883-0021 THOSE DUSKY SONS OF THE FOREST WERE NOT OFTEN DESIRABLE SIGHTS BUT CHARLES WAS AS ANXIOUS TO SEE THE FEATHERS AND PAINTED FACES OF THESE HEATHENS AS IF THEY WERE BROTHERS HE SPENT THE DAY IN WANDERING THROUGH THE WOODS
5825-50883-0022 BY THE MEREST CHANCE HE RAISED HIS DESPAIRING EYES AND GAZING ACROSS THE STREAM TO THE WOODS BEYOND SAW A LIGHT CHARLES STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET AND GAZED LIKE ONE TO WHOM LIFE HAS SUDDENLY BEEN RESTORED
5825-50883-0023 HE PLUNGED INTO THE CREEK WADED ACROSS AND STARTED THROUGH THE WOODS TOWARD THE LIGHT IT WAS MUCH FURTHER AWAY THAN HE HAD AT FIRST SUPPOSED AND HE WAS SEVERAL MINUTES IN REACHING THE CAMP FIRE
5825-50883-0024 TEN DUSKY SONS OF THE FOREST WERE SEATED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE WHILE TWO MEN IN THE GARB OF CIVILIZATION WERE ROVING ABOUT CHARLES FELT SOME MISGIVINGS AT FIRST ON DISCOVERING MEN OF HIS OWN COLOR IN THE CAMP
5825-50883-0025 HE CRAWLED FROM TREE TO TREE FROM LOG TO BUSH UNTIL HE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE FEATURES OF THE MEN WHEN HE FIRST GOT WITHIN SIGHT THEY STOOD WITH THEIR BACKS TOWARD HIM AND HE COULD NOT SEE THEIR FACES
5825-50883-0026 BUT AT LAST ONE TURNED ABOUT SO THAT THE GLARE OF THE FIRE LIGHT FELL FULL ON HIS FACE AND WITH A CRY OF JOY CHARLES STEVENS BOUNDED TO HIS FEET CRYING MISTER WATERS MISTER WATERS AND DASHED TOWARD THE CAMP
5825-50883-0027 A PAIR OF STRONG ARMS ENCIRCLED HIS WAIST AND THE YOUNG MAN HEARD A VOICE SAY WHITE MAN GO TOO SOON HE HAD BEEN SEIZED BY A SENTRY
5825-50883-0028 BUT MISTER WATERS AND ORACUS HASTENED TO HIM AND HE WAS RELEASED THE OTHER WHITE MAN WAS THE BROTHER OF MISTER WATERS AND CHARLES BEWILDERED OVERJOYED YET FAINT AND WEAK WAS HALF LED AND HALF CARRIED TO THE CAMP

5825-50883-0037 CHARLES ATE SOME BROILED VENISON AND WENT TO SLEEP SO EXHAUSTED WAS HE THAT HE DID NOT AWAKE UNTIL THE NOISE OF BREAKING CAMP AROUSED HIM
5825-50883-0038 ANOTHER WHITE MAN WAS IN CAMP HIS HANDS WERE FASTENED BEHIND HIS BACK AND HE WAS TIED TO A TREE HIS SALLOW COMPLEXION AND ANGULAR FEATURES WERE FAMILIAR TO CHARLES STEVENS THE PRISONER WAS JOEL MARTIN
5825-50883-0039 TWO OF THE INDIANS CAPTURED HIM LAST NIGHT EXPLAINED GEORGE WATERS HE WAS PROWLING ABOUT IN THE WOODS AND THEY SEIZED HIM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH HIM CHARLES ASKED

5825-50883-0061 UNTIL ALL WERE FREED THIS REQUIRED SEVERAL MOMENTS OF TIME AND THE CONFUSION AND UPROAR WHICH THEY WERE COMPELLED TO MAKE WAS ROUSING THE TOWN MISTER PARRIS HALF DRESSED RAN BAREFOOT THROUGH THE TOWN WAVING HIS LONG ARMS IN THE AIR
5825-50883-0062 AND SHOUTING THAT THE FIENDS OF THE AIR HAD CONSPIRED TO LIBERATE THE PRISONERS HIS WORDS AND HIS WILD FANATICAL MANNER TENDED RATHER TO INCREASE THE FEAR OF THE PEOPLE OF SALEM THAN DIMINISH IT THEN THERE WENT OUT THE REPORT THROUGH THE VILLAGE THAT THE INDIANS HAD ATTACKED THE TOWN
5825-50883-0063 AND THE PEOPLE ROUSED FROM THEIR MIDNIGHT SLUMBERS MAGNIFIED THE NUMBERS OF THE ASSAILANTS TEN TO ONE CORA MOTHER WHISPERED CHARLES THIS WAY HE TOOK A HAND OF EACH AND STARTED TO RUN FROM THE JAIL DOWN THE STREET
