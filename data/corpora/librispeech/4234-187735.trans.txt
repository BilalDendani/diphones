4234-187735-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE QUESTING HANDS WITHIN MY VIEW FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM WHERE I SAT IN DEEPEST SHADOW
4234-187735-0001 THROUGH THE PARTLY OPENED WINDOW IT WAS SCREWED LIKE OUR OWN WERE ROWS OF GLASS HOUSES GLEAMING IN THE MOONLIGHT AND BEYOND THEM ORDERLY RANKS OF FLOWER BEDS EXTENDING INTO A BLUE HAZE OF DISTANCE
4234-187735-0002 BY REASON OF THE MOON'S POSITION NO LIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM BUT MY EYES FROM LONG WATCHING WERE GROWN FAMILIAR WITH THE DARKNESS AND I COULD SEE BURKE QUITE CLEARLY AS HE LAY IN THE BED BETWEEN MY POST AND THE WINDOW
4234-187735-0003 I SEEMED TO BE BACK AGAIN IN THOSE DAYS OF THE TROUBLED PAST WHEN FIRST NAYLAND SMITH AND I HAD COME TO GRIPS WITH THE SERVANTS OF DOCTOR FU MANCHU A MORE PEACEFUL SCENE THAN THIS FLOWER PLANTED CORNER OF ESSEX IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE
4234-187735-0004 BUT EITHER BECAUSE OF MY KNOWLEDGE THAT ITS PEACE WAS CHIMERICAL OR BECAUSE OF THAT OUTFLUNG CONSCIOUSNESS OF DANGER WHICH ACTUALLY OR IN MY IMAGINATION PRECEDED THE COMING OF THE CHINAMAN'S AGENTS
4234-187735-0005 WHAT INFORMATION HAD BURKE TO SELL HE HAD REFUSED FOR SOME REASON TO DISCUSS THE MATTER THAT EVENING AND NOW ENACTING THE PART ALLOTTED HIM BY NAYLAND SMITH HE FEIGNED SLEEP CONSISTENTLY
4234-187735-0006 ALL THE CHANCES WERE IN OUR FAVOR TO NIGHT FOR WHILST I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT DOCTOR FU MANCHU WAS SET UPON THE REMOVAL OF THE EX OFFICER OF NEW YORK POLICE NEITHER COULD I DOUBT THAT OUR PRESENCE IN THE FARM WAS UNKNOWN TO THE AGENTS OF THE CHINAMAN
4234-187735-0007 ACCORDING TO BURKE CONSTANT ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO ACHIEVE FU MANCHU'S PURPOSE AND HAD ONLY BEEN FRUSTRATED BY HIS BURKE'S WAKEFULNESS THERE WAS EVERY PROBABILITY THAT ANOTHER ATTEMPT WOULD BE MADE TO NIGHT
4234-187735-0008 ANY ONE WHO HAS BEEN FORCED BY CIRCUMSTANCE TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A VIGIL AS THIS WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THE MARKED CHANGES CORRESPONDING WITH PHASES OF THE EARTH'S MOVEMENT WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AT MIDNIGHT AT TWO O'CLOCK AND AGAIN AT FOUR O'CLOCK
4234-187735-0009 DURING THOSE FOURS HOURS FALLS A PERIOD WHEREIN ALL LIFE IS AT ITS LOWEST EBB AND EVERY PHYSICIAN IS AWARE THAT THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF A PATIENT'S PASSING BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND FOUR A M THAN AT ANY OTHER PERIOD DURING THE CYCLE OF THE HOURS
4234-187735-0010 TO NIGHT I BECAME SPECIALLY AWARE OF THIS LOWERING OF VITALITY AND NOW WITH THE NIGHT AT THAT DARKEST PHASE WHICH PRECEDES THE DAWN AN INDESCRIBABLE DREAD SUCH AS I HAD KNOWN BEFORE IN MY DEALINGS WITH THE CHINAMAN ASSAILED ME
4234-187735-0011 WATCHED INTENTLY THE BRIGHT OBLONG OF THE WINDOW WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST HERALDING SOUND A BLACK SILHOUETTE CREPT UP AGAINST THE PANE THE SILHOUETTE OF A SMALL MALFORMED HEAD A DOG LIKE HEAD
4234-187735-0012 DEEP SET IN SQUARE SHOULDERS MALIGNANT EYES PEERED INTENTLY IN HIGHER IT AROSE THAT WICKED HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW THEN CROUCHED DOWN ON THE SILL AND BECAME LESS SHARPLY DEFINED AS THE CREATURE STOOPED TO THE OPENING BELOW
4234-187735-0013 THERE WAS A FAINT SOUND OF SNIFFING JUDGING FROM THE STARK HORROR WHICH I EXPERIENCED MYSELF I DOUBTED NOW IF BURKE COULD SUSTAIN THE ROLE ALLOTTED HIM IN BENEATH THE SLIGHTLY RAISED WINDOW CAME A HAND
4234-187735-0014 PERCEPTIBLE TO ME DESPITE THE DARKNESS OF THE ROOM IT SEEMED TO PROJECT FROM THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OUTSIDE THE PANE TO BE THRUST FORWARD AND FORWARD AND FORWARD THAT SMALL HAND WITH THE OUTSTRETCHED FINGERS
4234-187735-0015 THE UNKNOWN POSSESSES UNIQUE TERRORS AND SINCE I WAS UNABLE TO CONCEIVE WHAT MANNER OF THING THIS COULD BE WHICH EXTENDING ITS INCREDIBLY LONG ARMS NOW SOUGHT THE THROAT OF THE MAN UPON THE BED
4234-187735-0016 QUICK SIR QUICK SCREAMED BURKE STARTING UP FROM THE PILLOW THE QUESTING HANDS HAD REACHED HIS THROAT CHOKING DOWN AN URGENT DREAD THAT I HAD OF TOUCHING THE THING WHICH REACHED THROUGH THE WINDOW TO KILL THE SLEEPER
4234-187735-0017 THEY SEEMED TO BE OF STEEL WIRE AND WITH A SUDDEN FRIGHTFUL SENSE OF IMPOTENCE
4234-187735-0018 DESPITE THE CONFUSION OF MY MIND I BECAME AWARE OF SOUNDS OUTSIDE AND BELOW ME TWICE THE THING AT THE WINDOW COUGHED THERE WAS AN INCESSANT LASH LIKE CRACKING
4234-187735-0019 OF A PISTOL SNARLING LIKE THAT OF A WILD BEAST CAME FROM THE CREATURE WITH THE HAIRY ARMS TOGETHER WITH RENEWED COUGHING BUT THE STEEL GRIP RELAXED NOT ONE IOTA I REALIZED TWO THINGS THE FIRST THAT IN MY TERROR AT THE SUDDENNESS OF THE ATTACK
4234-187735-0020 I HAD OMITTED TO ACT AS PRE ARRANGED THE SECOND THAT I HAD DISCREDITED THE STRENGTH OF THE VISITANT WHILST SMITH HAD FORESEEN IT DESISTING IN MY VAIN ENDEAVOR TO PIT MY STRENGTH AGAINST THAT OF THE NAMELESS THING
4234-187735-0021 TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF WEYMOUTH AND MYSELF AS I LEAPED BACK TO THE WINDOW AND UPLIFTED THIS PRIMITIVE WEAPON A SECOND SHOT SOUNDED FROM BELOW AND MORE FIERCE SNARLING COUGHING AND GUTTURAL MUTTERINGS ASSAILED MY EARS FROM BEYOND THE PANE
4234-187735-0022 LIFTING THE HEAVY BLADE I BROUGHT IT DOWN WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON THE NEARER OF THOSE HAIRY ARMS WHERE IT CROSSED THE WINDOW LEDGE SEVERING MUSCLE TENDON AND BONE AS EASILY AS A KNIFE MIGHT CUT CHEESE A SHRIEK
4234-187735-0023 A SHRIEK NEITHER HUMAN NOR ANIMAL BUT GRUESOMELY COMPOUNDED OF BOTH FOLLOWED AND MERGED INTO A CHOKING COUGH LIKE A FLASH THE OTHER SHAGGY ARM WAS WITHDRAWN AND SOME VAGUELY SEEN BODY WENT ROLLING DOWN THE SLOPING RED TILES
4234-187735-0024 WITH A SECOND PIERCING SHRIEK LOUDER THAN THAT RECENTLY UTTERED BY BURKE WAILING THROUGH THE NIGHT FROM SOMEWHERE BELOW I TURNED DESPERATELY TO THE MAN ON THE BED WHO NOW WAS BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY SILENT
4234-187735-0025 A CANDLE WITH MATCHES STOOD UPON A TABLE HARD BY AND MY FINGERS FAR FROM STEADY I SET ABOUT OBTAINING A LIGHT THIS ACCOMPLISHED I STOOD THE CANDLE UPON THE LITTLE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND RETURNED TO BURKE'S SIDE MERCIFUL GOD I CRIED
4234-187735-0026 OF ALL THE PICTURES WHICH REMAIN IN MY MEMORY SOME OF THEM DARK ENOUGH I CAN FIND NONE MORE HORRIBLE THAN THAT WHICH NOW CONFRONTED ME IN THE DIM CANDLE LIGHT BURKE LAY CROSSWISE ON THE BED HIS HEAD THROWN BACK AND SAGGING ONE RIGID HAND HE HELD IN THE AIR
4234-187735-0027 DEFIED ALL MY EFFORTS
4234-187735-0028 I TOOK A KNIFE FROM MY POCKET AND TENDON BY TENDON CUT AWAY THAT UNCANNY GRIP FROM BURKE'S THROAT BUT MY LABOR WAS IN VAIN BURKE WAS DEAD
4234-187735-0029 I THINK I FAILED TO REALIZE THIS FOR SOME TIME MY CLOTHES WERE STICKING CLAMMILY TO MY BODY I WAS BATHED IN PERSPIRATION AND SHAKING FURIOUSLY I CLUTCHED AT THE EDGE OF THE WINDOW AVOIDING THE BLOODY PATCH UPON THE LEDGE
4234-187735-0030 WHAT HAD BEEN THE MEANING OF THAT SCREAM WHICH I HAD HEARD
4234-187735-0031 THERE WAS A GREAT STIRRING ALL ABOUT ME SMITH I CRIED FROM THE WINDOW SMITH FOR MERCY'S SAKE WHERE ARE YOU FOOTSTEPS CAME RACING UP THE STAIRS
4234-187735-0032 BEHIND ME THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND NAYLAND SMITH STUMBLED INTO THE ROOM GOD HE SAID AND STARTED BACK IN THE DOORWAY HAVE YOU GOT IT SMITH I DEMANDED HOARSELY IN SANITY'S NAME WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT
4234-187735-0033 COME DOWNSTAIRS REPLIED SMITH QUIETLY AND SEE FOR YOURSELF HE TURNED HIS HEAD ASIDE FROM THE BED VERY UNSTEADILY I FOLLOWED HIM DOWN THE STAIRS AND THROUGH THE RAMBLING OLD HOUSE OUT INTO THE STONE PAVED COURTYARD
4234-187735-0034 PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER RETURN TO THE HOUSE HE SAID LOOKING HIM SQUARELY IN THE EYES
4234-187735-0035 BRACE UP SAID SMITH LAYING HIS HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER REMEMBER HE CHOSE TO PLAY WITH FIRE ONE WILD LOOK THE MAN CAST FROM SMITH TO ME THEN WENT OFF STAGGERING TOWARD THE FARM SMITH I BEGAN
4234-187735-0036 HE TURNED TO ME WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE
