639-143022-0000 A LONELY RIDE AS I STEPPED INTO THE SLUMGULLION STAGE I SAW THAT IT WAS A DARK NIGHT A LONELY ROAD
639-143022-0001 LET ME ASSURE THE READER THAT I HAVE NO ULTERIOR DESIGN IN MAKING THIS ASSERTION
639-143022-0002 THE STORYTELLER WHO WILLFULLY TEMPTS FATE BY SUCH OBVIOUS BEGINNINGS WHO IS TO THE EXPECTANT READER IN DANGER OF BEING ROBBED OR HALF MURDERED OR FRIGHTENED BY AN ESCAPED LUNATIC OR INTRODUCED TO HIS LADYLOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME
639-143022-0003 DESERVES TO BE DETECTED I AM RELIEVED TO SAY THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS OCCURRED TO ME THE ROAD FROM WINGDAM TO SLUMGULLION KNEW NO OTHER BANDITTI THAN THE REGULARLY LICENSED HOTELKEEPERS
639-143022-0004 LUNATICS HAD NOT YET REACHED SUCH DEPTH OF IMBECILITY AS TO RIDE OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL IN CALIFORNIA STAGES AND MY LAURA AMIABLE AND LONG SUFFERING AS SHE ALWAYS IS COULD NOT I FEAR
639-143022-0005 HAVE BORNE UP AGAINST THESE DEPRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION ON ME I STOOD WITH MY SHAWL AND CARPETBAG IN HAND GAZING DOUBTINGLY ON THE VEHICLE
639-143022-0006 EVEN IN THE DARKNESS THE RED DUST OF WINGDAM WAS VISIBLE ON ITS ROOF AND SIDES AND THE RED SLIME OF SLUMGULLION CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO ITS WHEELS I OPENED THE DOOR THE STAGE CREAKED EASILY
639-143022-0007 AND IN THE GLOOMY ABYSS THE SWAYING STRAPS BECKONED ME LIKE GHOSTLY HANDS TO COME IN NOW AND HAVE MY SUFFERINGS OUT AT ONCE I MUST NOT OMIT TO MENTION THE OCCURRENCE OF A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH STRUCK ME AS APPALLING AND MYSTERIOUS
639-143022-0008 A LOUNGER ON THE STEPS OF THE HOTEL WHO I HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE WAS NOT IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE STAGE COMPANY GRAVELY DESCENDED AND WALKING TOWARD THE CONVEYANCE TRIED THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR OPENED IT EXPECTORATED IN THE CARRIAGE
639-143022-0009 EXPECTORATED CAREFULLY ON THE AXLE AND RETURNED SLOWLY AND PENSIVELY TO THE HOTEL A THIRD SPECTATOR WEARILY DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM ONE OF THE IONIC COLUMNS OF THE PORTICO AND WALKED TO THE BOX
639-143022-0010 REMAINED FOR A MOMENT IN SERIOUS AND EXPECTORATIVE CONTEMPLATION OF THE BOOT AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS COLUMN THERE WAS SOMETHING SO WEIRD IN THIS BAPTISM THAT I GREW QUITE NERVOUS PERHAPS I WAS OUT OF SPIRITS
639-143022-0011 A NUMBER OF INFINITESIMAL ANNOYANCES WINDING UP WITH THE RESOLUTE PERSISTENCY OF THE CLERK AT THE STAGE OFFICE TO ENTER MY NAME MISSPELT ON THE WAYBILL HAD NOT PREDISPOSED ME TO CHEERFULNESS
639-143022-0012 THE INMATES OF THE EUREKA HOUSE FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE THERE WAS THE PREVAILING OPINION SO COMMON TO MANY HONEST PEOPLE THAT A SERIOUS STYLE OF DEPORTMENT AND CONDUCT TOWARD A STRANGER INDICATES HIGH GENTILITY AND ELEVATED STATION
639-143022-0013 OBEYING THIS PRINCIPLE ALL HILARITY CEASED ON MY ENTRANCE TO SUPPER AND GENERAL REMARK MERGED INTO THE SAFER AND UNCOMPROMISING CHRONICLE OF SEVERAL BAD CASES OF DIPHTHERIA THEN EPIDEMIC AT WINGDAM
639-143022-0014 WHEN I LEFT THE DINING ROOM WITH AN ODD FEELING THAT I HAD BEEN SUPPING EXCLUSIVELY ON MUSTARD AND TEA LEAVES I STOPPED A MOMENT AT THE PARLOR DOOR A PIANO HARMONIOUSLY RELATED TO THE DINNER BELL
639-143022-0015 TINKLED RESPONSIVE TO A DIFFIDENT AND UNCERTAIN TOUCH ON THE WHITE WALL THE SHADOW OF AN OLD AND SHARP PROFILE WAS BENDING OVER SEVERAL SYMMETRICAL AND SHADOWY CURLS I SEZ TO MARIAR MARIAR SEZ I
639-143022-0016 PRAISE TO THE FACE IS OPEN DISGRACE I HEARD NO MORE DREADING SOME SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SINCERE EXPRESSION ON THE SUBJECT OF FEMALE LOVELINESS I WALKED AWAY
639-143022-0017 CHECKING THE COMPLIMENT THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE RISEN UNBIDDEN TO MY LIPS AND HAVE BROUGHT SHAME AND SORROW TO THE HOUSEHOLD IT WAS WITH THE MEMORY OF THESE EXPERIENCES RESTING HEAVILY UPON ME THAT I STOOD HESITATINGLY BEFORE THE STAGE DOOR
639-143022-0018 HE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF ME I LOOKED LONGINGLY AT THE BOX SEAT BUT HE DID NOT RESPOND TO THE APPEAL I FLUNG MY CARPETBAG INTO THE CHASM DIVED RECKLESSLY AFTER IT AND BEFORE I WAS FAIRLY SEATED
639-143022-0019 AND THE NIGHT AND ITS SHADOWS MOVED SOLEMNLY UPON US TO SAY IT WAS DARK EXPRESSED BUT FAINTLY THE PITCHY OBSCURITY THAT ENCOMPASSED THE VEHICLE THE ROADSIDE TREES WERE SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE AS DEEPER MASSES OF SHADOW
639-143022-0020 I KNEW THEM ONLY BY THE PECULIAR SODDEN ODOR THAT FROM TIME TO TIME SLUGGISHLY FLOWED IN AT THE OPEN WINDOW AS WE ROLLED BY WE PROCEEDED SLOWLY SO LEISURELY THAT LEANING FROM THE CARRIAGE I MORE THAN ONCE DETECTED THE FRAGRANT SIGH OF SOME ASTONISHED COW
639-143022-0021 WHOSE RUMINATING REPOSE UPON THE HIGHWAY WE HAD RUTHLESSLY DISTURBED BUT IN THE DARKNESS OUR PROGRESS MORE THE GUIDANCE OF SOME MYSTERIOUS INSTINCT THAN ANY APPARENT VOLITION OF OUR OWN GAVE AN INDEFINABLE CHARM OF SECURITY TO OUR JOURNEY
639-143022-0022 THAT A MOMENT'S HESITATION OR INDECISION ON THE PART OF THE DRIVER WOULD HAVE DESTROYED I HAD INDULGED A HOPE THAT IN THE EMPTY VEHICLE I MIGHT OBTAIN THAT REST SO OFTEN DENIED ME IN ITS CROWDED CONDITION IT WAS A WEAK DELUSION
639-143022-0023 WHEN I STRETCHED OUT MY LIMBS IT WAS ONLY TO FIND THAT THE ORDINARY CONVENIENCES FOR MAKING SEVERAL PEOPLE DISTINCTLY UNCOMFORTABLE WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT MY INDIVIDUAL FRAME AT LAST RESTING MY ARMS ON THE STRAPS
639-143022-0024 BY DINT OF MUCH GYMNASTIC EFFORT I BECAME SUFFICIENTLY COMPOSED TO BE AWARE OF A MORE REFINED SPECIES OF TORTURE THE SPRINGS OF THE STAGE RISING AND FALLING REGULARLY PRODUCED A RHYTHMICAL BEAT WHICH BEGAN TO ABSORB MY ATTENTION PAINFULLY
639-143022-0025 INEQUALITIES OF THE ROAD ONLY QUICKENED ITS UTTERANCE OR DRAWLED IT TO AN EXASPERATING LENGTH IT WAS OF NO USE TO CONSIDER THE STATEMENT SERIOUSLY IT WAS OF NO USE TO EXCEPT TO IT INDIGNANTLY
639-143022-0026 IT WAS OF NO USE TO RECALL THE MANY INSTANCES WHERE PRAISE TO THE FACE HAD REDOUNDED TO THE EVERLASTING HONOR OF PRAISER AND BEPRAISED OF NO USE TO DWELL SENTIMENTALLY ON MODEST GENIUS AND COURAGE LIFTED UP AND STRENGTHENED BY OPEN COMMENDATION
639-143022-0027 OF NO USE TO EXCEPT TO THE MYSTERIOUS FEMALE TO PICTURE HER AS REARING A THIN BLOODED GENERATION ON SELFISH AND MECHANICALLY REPEATED AXIOMS ALL THIS FAILED TO COUNTERACT THE MONOTONOUS REPETITION OF THIS SENTENCE
639-143022-0028 THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GIVE IN AND I WAS ABOUT TO ACCEPT IT WEAKLY AS WE TOO OFTEN TREAT OTHER ILLUSIONS OF DARKNESS AND NECESSITY FOR THE TIME BEING
639-143022-0029 WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF SOME OTHER ANNOYANCE THAT HAD BEEN FORCING ITSELF UPON ME FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HOW QUIET THE DRIVER WAS WAS THERE ANY DRIVER HAD I ANY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS NOT LYING GAGGED AND BOUND ON THE ROADSIDE
639-143022-0030 AND THE HIGHWAYMAN WITH BLACKENED FACE WHO DID THE THING SO QUIETLY DRIVING ME WHITHER THE THING IS PERFECTLY FEASIBLE AND WHAT IS THIS FANCY NOW BEING JOLTED OUT OF ME A STORY IT'S OF NO USE TO KEEP IT BACK
639-143022-0031 PARTICULARLY IN THIS ABYSMAL VEHICLE AND HERE IT COMES I AM A MARQUIS A FRENCH MARQUIS FRENCH BECAUSE THE PEERAGE IS NOT SO WELL KNOWN
639-143022-0032 A MARQUIS BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC READER DELIGHTS IN THE NOBILITY MY NAME IS SOMETHING LIGNY
639-143022-0033 IT IS A DARK NIGHT AND I FALL ASLEEP AND TELL MY HONEST COACHMAN ANDRE NOT TO DISTURB ME AND DREAM OF AN ANGEL THE CARRIAGE AT LAST STOPS AT THE CHATEAU
639-143022-0034 IT IS SO DARK THAT WHEN I ALIGHT I DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE FACE OF THE FOOTMAN WHO HOLDS THE CARRIAGE DOOR BUT WHAT OF THAT PESTE I AM HEAVY WITH SLEEP THE SAME OBSCURITY ALSO HIDES THE OLD FAMILIAR INDECENCIES OF THE STATUES ON THE TERRACE
639-143022-0035 BUT THERE IS A DOOR AND IT OPENS AND SHUTS BEHIND ME SMARTLY THEN I FIND MYSELF IN A TRAP IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BRIGAND WHO HAS QUIETLY GAGGED POOR ANDRE AND CONDUCTED THE CARRIAGE THITHER THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME TO DO AS A GALLANT FRENCH MARQUIS BUT TO SAY
639-143022-0036 PARBLEU DRAW MY RAPIER AND DIE VALOROUSLY I AM FOUND A WEEK OR TWO AFTER OUTSIDE A DESERTED CABARET NEAR THE BARRIER WITH A HOLE THROUGH MY RUFFLED LINEN AND MY POCKETS STRIPPED NO ON SECOND THOUGHTS I AM RESCUED
639-143022-0037 RESCUED BY THE ANGEL I HAVE BEEN DREAMING OF WHO IS THE ASSUMED DAUGHTER OF THE BRIGAND BUT THE REAL DAUGHTER OF AN INTIMATE FRIEND LOOKING FROM THE WINDOW AGAIN IN THE VAIN HOPE OF DISTINGUISHING THE DRIVER
639-143022-0038 I FOUND MY EYES WERE GROWING ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS
639-143022-0039 IT HAD AN INDESCRIBABLY UNREAL AND THEATRICAL EFFECT IT WAS THE FULL MOON OF NORMA THAT REMARKABLE CELESTIAL PHENOMENON WHICH RISES SO PALPABLY TO A HUSHED AUDIENCE AND A SUBLIME ANDANTE CHORUS UNTIL THE CASTA DIVA IS SUNG
639-143022-0040 THE INCONSTANT MOON THAT THEN AND THEREAFTER REMAINS FIXED IN THE HEAVENS AS THOUGH IT WERE A PART OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM INAUGURATED BY JOSHUA AGAIN THE WHITE ROBED DRUIDS FILED PAST ME
639-143022-0041 AGAIN I SAW THAT IMPROBABLE MISTLETOE CUT FROM THAT IMPOSSIBLE OAK AND AGAIN COLD CHILLS RAN DOWN MY BACK WITH THE FIRST STRAIN OF THE RECITATIVE
639-143022-0042 MY FEARS FOR THE DRIVER WERE DISSIPATED WITH THE RISING MOON A FAMILIAR SOUND HAD ASSURED ME OF HIS PRESENCE IN THE FULL POSSESSION OF AT LEAST ONE OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
639-143022-0043 FREQUENT AND FULL EXPECTORATION CONVINCED ME THAT HIS LIPS WERE AS YET NOT SEALED BY THE GAG OF HIGHWAYMEN AND SOOTHED MY ANXIOUS EAR
639-143022-0044 WITH THIS LOAD LIFTED FROM MY MIND AND ASSISTED BY THE MILD PRESENCE OF DIANA WHO LEFT AS WHEN SHE VISITED ENDYMION MUCH OF HER SPLENDOR OUTSIDE MY CAVERN I LOOKED AROUND THE EMPTY VEHICLE ON THE FORWARD SEAT LAY A WOMAN'S HAIRPIN
639-143022-0045 I PICKED IT UP WITH AN INTEREST THAT HOWEVER SOON ABATED THERE WAS NO SCENT OF THE ROSES TO CLING TO IT STILL NOT EVEN OF HAIR OIL NO BEND OR TWIST IN ITS RIGID ANGLES BETRAYED ANY TRAIT OF ITS WEARER'S CHARACTER
639-143022-0046 I TRIED TO THINK THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MARIAR'S I TRIED TO IMAGINE THAT CONFINING THE SYMMETRICAL CURLS OF THAT GIRL IT MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE SOFT COMPLIMENTS WHISPERED IN HER EARS WHICH PROVOKED THE WRATH OF THE AGED FEMALE BUT IN VAIN
639-143022-0047 IT WAS RETICENT AND UNSWERVING IN ITS UPRIGHT FIDELITY AND AT LAST SLIPPED LISTLESSLY THROUGH MY FINGERS I HAD DOZED REPEATEDLY WAKED ON THE THRESHOLD OF OBLIVION BY CONTACT WITH SOME OF THE ANGLES OF THE COACH
639-143022-0048 AND FEELING THAT I WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ASSUMING IN IMITATION OF A HUMBLE INSECT OF MY CHILDISH RECOLLECTION THAT SPHERICAL SHAPE WHICH COULD BEST RESIST THOSE IMPRESSIONS WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT THE MOON RIDING HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
639-143022-0049 HAD BEGUN TO SEPARATE THE FORMLESS MASSES OF THE SHADOWY LANDSCAPE TREES ISOLATED IN CLUMPS AND ASSEMBLAGES CHANGED PLACES BEFORE MY WINDOW THE SHARP OUTLINES OF THE DISTANT HILLS CAME BACK AS IN DAYLIGHT
639-143022-0050 FAUSTUS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED HIS AGONIZING PRAYER WHEN A SUDDEN SPASM OF ACTIVITY ATTACKED MY DRIVER A SUCCESSION OF WHIP SNAPPINGS LIKE A PACK OF CHINESE CRACKERS BROKE FROM THE BOX BEFORE ME THE STAGE LEAPED FORWARD
639-143022-0051 AND WHEN I COULD PICK MYSELF FROM UNDER THE SEAT A LONG WHITE BUILDING HAD IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY ROLLED BEFORE MY WINDOW IT MUST BE SLUMGULLION AS I DESCENDED FROM THE STAGE I ADDRESSED THE DRIVER I THOUGHT YOU CHANGED HORSES ON THE ROAD
639-143022-0052 SO WE DID TWO HOURS AGO THAT'S ODD I DIDN'T NOTICE IT
