5723-49750-0028 AND PAINED HIMSELF GRIEVOUSLY TO BRING HIS JOURNEY TO AN END THIS HE MIGHT NOT DO HE REELED AND FELL NOR COULD HE RISE AGAIN FOR THE HEART HAD BURST WITHIN HIS BREAST WHEN THE MAIDEN SAW HER LOVER'S PITEOUS PLIGHT
5723-49750-0029 SHE DEEMED THAT HE HAD SWOONED BY REASON OF HIS PAIN SHE KNEELED HASTILY AT HIS SIDE AND PUT THE ENCHANTED BREWAGE TO HIS LIPS BUT HE COULD NEITHER DRINK NOR SPEAK FOR HE WAS DEAD AS I HAVE TOLD YOU SHE BEWAILED HIS EVIL LOT
5723-49750-0030 WITH MANY SHRILL CRIES AND FLUNG THE USELESS FLACKET FAR AWAY
5723-49750-0031 MAKING A GARDEN OF THAT DESOLATE PLACE FOR MANY SAVING HERBS HAVE BEEN FOUND THERE SINCE THAT DAY BY THE SIMPLE FOLK OF THAT COUNTRY WHICH FROM THE MAGIC PHILTRE DERIVED ALL THEIR VIRTUE BUT WHEN THE MAIDEN KNEW THAT HER LOVER WAS DEAD
5723-49750-0032 SHE MADE SUCH WONDROUS SORROW AS NO MAN HAD EVER SEEN SHE KISSED HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND FALLING UPON HIS BODY TOOK HIM IN HER ARMS AND PRESSED HIM CLOSELY TO HER BREAST THERE WAS NO HEART SO HARD AS NOT TO BE TOUCHED BY HER SORROW
5723-49750-0033 FOR IN THIS FASHION DIED A DAME WHO WAS FAIR AND SWEET AND GRACIOUS BEYOND THE WONT OF THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN NOW THE KING AND HIS COMPANY SINCE THESE TWO LOVERS CAME NOT AGAIN PRESENTLY CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN TO LEARN THEIR END
5723-49750-0034 BUT WHEN THE KING CAME UPON THEM LIFELESS AND FAST IN THAT EMBRACE INCONTINENT HE FELL TO THE GROUND BEREFT OF SENSE AFTER HIS SPEECH HAD RETURNED TO HIM HE WAS PASSING HEAVY AND LAMENTED THEIR DOLEFUL CASE
5723-49750-0035 AND THUS DID ALL HIS PEOPLE WITH HIM THREE DAYS THEY KEPT THE BODIES OF THESE TWO FAIR CHILDREN FROM EARTH WITH UNCOVERED FACE ON THE THIRD DAY THEY SEALED THEM FAST IN A GOODLY COFFIN OF MARBLE
5723-49750-0036 AND BY THE COUNSEL OF ALL MEN LAID THEM SOFTLY TO REST ON THAT MOUNTAIN WHERE THEY DIED THEN THEY DEPARTED FROM THEM AND LEFT THEM TOGETHER ALONE
