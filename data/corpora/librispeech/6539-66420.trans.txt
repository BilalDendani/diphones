6539-66420-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO IN THE CHURCH AT GLENALLA
6539-66420-0001 AND FEVERSHAM TOOK HIS STAND BESIDE HER IT WAS VERY QUIET AND PEACEFUL WITHIN THAT TINY CHURCH THE AFTERNOON SUN SHONE THROUGH THE UPPER WINDOWS AND MADE A GOLDEN HAZE ABOUT THE ROOF THE NATURAL MURMURS OF THE SUMMER FLOATED PLEASANTLY THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR
6539-66420-0002 I AM GLAD THAT YOU REMEMBERED OUR DRIVE AND WHAT WE SAID SHE CONTINUED IT IS RATHER IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU SHOULD REMEMBER
6539-66420-0003 YOU WILL BE ONE OF THE ABSENT FRIENDS WHOM I SHALL NOT LOSE BECAUSE YOU ARE ABSENT SHE SPOKE SLOWLY LOOKING STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER WITHOUT FALTERING IT WAS A DIFFICULT SPEECH FOR HER TO DELIVER
6539-66420-0004 AND THE WORDS WERE READY TO HER LIPS AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF HARRY FEVERSHAM RECOVERED TO HER AFTER SO MANY YEARS SO MUCH SUSPENSE SO MUCH SUFFERING IT HAD SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE NEVER WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK THEM
6539-66420-0005 HOWEVER NECESSARY IT WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE SPOKEN BUT AS THEY STOOD OVER AGAINST ONE ANOTHER SHE HAD FORCED HERSELF TO REMEMBER THAT NECESSITY UNTIL SHE ACTUALLY RECOGNISED AND FELT IT THEN SHE HAD GONE BACK INTO THE CHURCH AND TAKEN A SEAT AND GATHERED UP HER STRENGTH
6539-66420-0006 IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR BOTH OF THEM SHE THOUGHT IF SHE SHOULD GIVE NO SIGN OF WHAT SO QUICK A SEPARATION COST HER HE WOULD KNOW SURELY ENOUGH AND SHE WISHED HIM TO KNOW SHE WISHED HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONE MOMENT OF HIS SIX YEARS
6539-66420-0007 BUT THAT COULD BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT THE SIGNS OF EMOTION SO SHE SPOKE HER SPEECH LOOKING STEADILY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE I KNOW THAT YOU WILL MIND VERY MUCH JUST AS I DO BUT THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT SHE RESUMED
6539-66420-0008 AT ALL EVENTS YOU ARE AT HOME AGAIN WITH THE RIGHT TO BE AT HOME
6539-66420-0009 BUT THERE ARE OTHER MUCH GREATER REASONS FROM WHICH WE CAN BOTH TAKE COMFORT COLONEL TRENCH TOLD ME ENOUGH OF YOUR CAPTIVITY TO CONVINCE ME THAT WE BOTH SEE WITH THE SAME EYES WE BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT THIS SECOND PARTING HARD AS IT IS IS STILL A VERY SLIGHT SMALL THING
6539-66420-0010 COMPARED WITH THE OTHER OUR FIRST PARTING OVER AT THE HOUSE SIX YEARS AGO I FELT VERY LONELY AFTER THAT AS I SHALL NOT FEEL LONELY NOW THERE WAS A GREAT BARRIER BETWEEN US THEN SEPARATING US FOREVER WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE MET AGAIN HERE OR AFTERWARDS
6539-66420-0011 I AM QUITE SURE OF THAT BUT YOU HAVE BROKEN THE BARRIER DOWN BY ALL YOUR PAIN AND BRAVERY DURING THESE LAST YEARS I AM NO LESS SURE OF THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT ABOUT IT AND I BELIEVE YOU ARE TOO
6539-66420-0012 SO THAT ALTHOUGH WE SHALL NOT SEE ONE ANOTHER HERE AND AS LONG AS WE LIVE THE AFTERWARDS IS QUITE SURE FOR US BOTH AND WE CAN WAIT FOR THAT YOU CAN YOU HAVE WAITED WITH SO MUCH STRENGTH ALL THESE YEARS SINCE WE PARTED AND I CAN TOO FOR I GET STRENGTH FROM YOUR VICTORY
6539-66420-0013 SHE STOPPED AND FOR A WHILE THERE WAS SILENCE IN THAT CHURCH TO FEVERSHAM HER WORDS WERE GRACIOUS AS RAIN UPON DRY LAND TO HEAR HER SPEAK THEM UPLIFTED HIM SO THAT THOSE SIX YEARS OF TRIAL OF SLINKING INTO CORNERS OUT OF THE SIGHT OF HIS FELLOWS OF LONELY ENDURANCE
6539-66420-0014 OF MANY HEART SINKINGS AND MUCH BODILY PAIN DWINDLED AWAY INTO INSIGNIFICANCE THEY HAD INDEED BORNE THEIR FRUIT TO HIM
6539-66420-0015 IN THE NILE VILLAGES IN THE DIM WIDE SPACES OF THE DESERT
6539-66420-0016 STILL HEARING HER VOICE THOUGH THE VOICE HAD CEASED LONG AGO THERE WERE CERTAIN BITTER WORDS WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN AND HE HAD TOLD SUTCH SO CLOSELY HAD THEY CLUNG AND STUNG THAT HE BELIEVED IN HIS DYING MOMENTS HE WOULD HEAR THEM AGAIN
6539-66420-0017 AND SO GO TO HIS GRAVE WITH HER REPROACHES RINGING IN HIS EARS HE REMEMBERED THAT PREDICTION OF HIS NOW AND KNEW THAT IT WAS FALSE THE WORDS HE WOULD HEAR WOULD BE THOSE WHICH SHE HAD JUST UTTERED FOR ETHNE'S PROPOSAL THAT THEY SHOULD SEPARATE HE WAS NOT UNPREPARED
6539-66420-0018 HE HAD HEARD ALREADY THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED AND HE DID NOT ARGUE AGAINST HER WISH BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE HAD MORE TO SAY TO HIM AND SHE HAD BUT SHE WAS SLOW TO SPEAK IT THIS WAS THE LAST TIME SHE WAS TO SEE HARRY FEVERSHAM SHE MEANT RESOLUTELY TO SEND HIM AWAY
6539-66420-0019 WHEN ONCE HE HAD PASSED THROUGH THAT CHURCH DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE SUNLIGHT AND THE SUMMER MURMURS CAME AND HIS SHADOW GONE FROM THE THRESHOLD SHE WOULD NEVER TALK WITH HIM OR SET HER EYES ON HIM UNTIL HER LIFE WAS ENDED
6539-66420-0020 SO SHE DEFERRED THE MOMENT OF HIS GOING BY SILENCES AND SLOW SPEECH IT MIGHT BE SO VERY LONG BEFORE THAT END CAME SHE HAD SHE THOUGHT THE RIGHT TO PROTRACT THIS ONE INTERVIEW SHE RATHER HOPED THAT HE WOULD SPEAK OF HIS TRAVELS HIS DANGERS
6539-66420-0021 SHE WAS PREPARED TO DISCUSS AT LENGTH WITH HIM EVEN THE POLITICS OF THE SOUDAN BUT HE WAITED FOR HER I AM GOING TO BE MARRIED SHE SAID AT LENGTH AND IMMEDIATELY I AM TO MARRY A FRIEND OF YOURS COLONEL DURRANCE THERE WAS HARDLY A PAUSE BEFORE FEVERSHAM ANSWERED HE HAS CARED FOR YOU A LONG WHILE
6539-66420-0022 I WAS NOT AWARE OF IT UNTIL I WENT AWAY BUT THINKING OVER EVERYTHING I THOUGHT IT LIKELY AND IN A VERY LITTLE TIME I BECAME SURE HE IS BLIND BLIND EXCLAIMED FEVERSHAM HE OF ALL MEN BLIND
6539-66420-0023 HIS BLINDNESS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING
6539-66420-0024 IT WAS NOT RIGHT I HAD FORGOTTEN THE WORDS OH A LONG TIME SINCE UNTIL COLONEL TRENCH REMINDED ME I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN THEM WHEN I DID I WAS NOT THINKING THEY WOULD LIVE SO IN YOUR THOUGHTS I AM SORRY THAT I SPOKE THEM OH THEY WERE JUST ENOUGH
6539-66420-0025 I NEVER BLAMED YOU FOR THEM SAID FEVERSHAM WITH A LAUGH
6539-66420-0026 IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM TO TALK OF HIS TRAVELS OR ADVENTURES THE OCCASION SEEMED TOO SERIOUS TOO VITAL THEY WERE TOGETHER TO DECIDE THE MOST SOLEMN ISSUE IN THEIR LIVES ONCE THE DECISION WAS MADE AS NOW IT HAD BEEN MADE HE FELT THAT THEY COULD HARDLY TALK ON OTHER TOPICS
6539-66420-0027 STILL KEPT HIM AT HER SIDE THOUGH SHE SAT SO CALMLY AND STILL THOUGH HER FACE WAS QUIET IN ITS LOOK OF GRAVITY HER HEART ACHED WITH LONGING JUST FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE PLEADED TO HERSELF THE SUNLIGHT WAS WITHDRAWING FROM THE WALLS OF THE CHURCH
6539-66420-0028 SHE MEASURED OUT A SPACE UPON THE WALLS WHERE IT STILL GLOWED BRIGHT WHEN ALL THAT SPACE WAS COLD GREY STONE SHE WOULD SEND HARRY FEVERSHAM AWAY I AM GLAD THAT YOU ESCAPED FROM OMDURMAN WITHOUT THE HELP OF LIEUTENANT SUTCH OR COLONEL DURRANCE
6539-66420-0029 I WANTED SO MUCH THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE DONE BY YOU ALONE WITHOUT ANYBODY'S HELP OR INTERFERENCE SHE SAID AND AFTER SHE HAD SPOKEN THERE FOLLOWED A SILENCE ONCE OR TWICE SHE LOOKED TOWARDS THE WALL AND EACH TIME SHE SAW THE SPACE OF GOLDEN LIGHT NARROWED
6539-66420-0030 AND KNEW THAT HER MINUTES WERE RUNNING OUT YOU SUFFERED HORRIBLY AT DONGOLA SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE COLONEL TRENCH TOLD ME WHAT DOES IT MATTER NOW FEVERSHAM ANSWERED THAT TIME SEEMS RATHER FAR AWAY TO ME HAD YOU ANYTHING OF MINE WITH YOU I HAD YOUR WHITE FEATHER
6539-66420-0031 BUT ANYTHING ELSE ANY LITTLE THING WHICH I HAD GIVEN YOU IN THE OTHER DAYS NOTHING I HAD YOUR PHOTOGRAPH SHE SAID I KEPT IT FEVERSHAM SUDDENLY LEANED DOWN TOWARDS HER YOU DID ETHNE NODDED HER HEAD
6539-66420-0032 YES THE MOMENT I WENT UPSTAIRS THAT NIGHT I PACKED UP YOUR PRESENTS AND ADDRESSED THEM TO YOUR ROOMS YES I GOT THEM IN LONDON BUT I PUT YOUR PHOTOGRAPH ASIDE FIRST OF ALL TO KEEP
6539-66420-0033 BUT I HAD ALREADY PUT YOUR PHOTOGRAPH ASIDE I HAVE IT NOW I SHALL KEEP IT AND THE FEATHERS TOGETHER SHE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT
6539-66420-0034 I HAD NO RIGHT TO ANYTHING SAID FEVERSHAM THERE WAS STILL A NARROW SLIP OF GOLD UPON THE GREY SPACE OF STONE WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW SHE ASKED I SHALL GO HOME FIRST AND SEE MY FATHER IT WILL DEPEND UPON THE WAY WE MEET YOU WILL LET COLONEL DURRANCE KNOW
6539-66420-0035 I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IT YES I WILL WRITE TO DURRANCE THE SLIP OF GOLD WAS GONE THE CLEAR LIGHT OF A SUMMER EVENING FILLED THE CHURCH A LIGHT WITHOUT RADIANCE OR ANY COLOUR
