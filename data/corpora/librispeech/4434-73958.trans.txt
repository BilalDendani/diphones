4434-73958-0000 THE TIME OF ROSES GARDEN ROSES REINE BLANCHE THE OLD WHITE ROSE OLD GARDEN ROSES AS STANDARDS CLIMBING AND RAMBLING ROSES SCOTCH BRIARS
4434-73958-0001 HYBRID PERPETUALS A DIFFICULTY TEA ROSES PRUNING SWEET PEAS AUTUMN SOWN ELDER TREES VIRGINIAN COWSLIP DIVIDING SPRING BLOOMING PLANTS
4434-73958-0002 TWO BEST MULLEINS WHITE FRENCH WILLOW BRACKEN WHAT IS ONE TO SAY ABOUT JUNE THE TIME OF PERFECT YOUNG SUMMER THE FULFILMENT OF THE PROMISE OF THE EARLIER MONTHS
4434-73958-0003 AND WITH AS YET NO SIGN TO REMIND ONE THAT ITS FRESH YOUNG BEAUTY WILL EVER FADE FOR MY OWN PART I WANDER UP INTO THE WOOD AND SAY JUNE IS HERE JUNE IS HERE THANK GOD FOR LOVELY JUNE
4434-73958-0004 THE SOFT COOING OF THE WOOD DOVE THE GLAD SONG OF MANY BIRDS THE FLITTING OF BUTTERFLIES THE HUM OF ALL THE LITTLE WINGED PEOPLE AMONG THE BRANCHES THE SWEET EARTH SCENTS
4434-73958-0005 ALL SEEM TO SAY THE SAME WITH AN ENDLESS REITERATION NEVER WEARYING BECAUSE SO GLADSOME IT IS THE OFFERING OF THE HYMN OF PRAISE THE LIZARDS RUN IN AND OUT OF THE HEATHY TUFTS IN THE HOT SUNSHINE
4434-73958-0006 AND AS THE LONG DAY DARKENS THE NIGHT JAR TROLLS OUT HIS STRANGE SONG SO WELCOME BECAUSE IT IS THE PRELUDE TO THE PERFECT SUMMER NIGHT HERE AND THERE A GLOWWORM SHOWS ITS LITTLE LAMP
4434-73958-0007 JUNE IS HERE JUNE IS HERE THANK GOD FOR LOVELY JUNE AND JUNE IS THE TIME OF ROSES I HAVE GREAT DELIGHT IN THE BEST OF THE OLD GARDEN ROSES
4434-73958-0008 THE PROVENCE CABBAGE ROSE SWEETEST OF ALL SWEETS AND THE MOSS ROSE ITS CRESTED VARIETY THE EARLY DAMASK AND ITS RED AND WHITE STRIPED KIND THE OLD NEARLY SINGLE REINE BLANCHE
4434-73958-0009 THE WHITE IS A CREAMY WHITE THE OUTSIDES OF THE OUTER PETALS ARE STAINED WITH RED FIRST SHOWING CLEARLY IN THE BUD THE SCENT IS DELICATE AND DELIGHTFUL WITH A FAINT SUSPICION OF MAGNOLIA
4434-73958-0010 A FEW YEARS AGO THIS PRETTY OLD ROSE FOUND ITS WAY TO ONE OF THE MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY WHERE IT GAINED MUCH PRAISE IT WAS THERE THAT I RECOGNISED MY OLD FRIEND AND LEARNED ITS NAME
4434-73958-0011 I AM FOND OF THE OLD ROSA ALBA BOTH SINGLE AND DOUBLE AND ITS DAUGHTER MAIDEN'S BLUSH HOW SELDOM ONE SEES THESE ROSES EXCEPT IN COTTAGE GARDENS BUT WHAT GOOD TASTE IT SHOWS ON THE COTTAGER'S PART
4434-73958-0012 FOR WHAT ROSE IS SO PERFECTLY AT HOME UPON THE MODEST LITTLE WAYSIDE PORCH I HAVE ALSO LEARNT FROM COTTAGE GARDENS HOW PRETTY ARE SOME OF THE OLD ROSES GROWN AS STANDARDS THE PICTURE OF MY NEIGHBOUR MISSUS EDGELER
4434-73958-0013 PICKING ME A BUNCH FROM HER BUSH SHOWS HOW FREELY THEY FLOWER AND WHAT FINE STANDARDS THEY MAKE I HAVE TAKEN THE HINT AND HAVE NOW SOME BIG ROUND HEADED STANDARDS THE HEADS A YARD THROUGH
4434-73958-0014 THAT ARE WORTH LOOKING AT THOUGH ONE OF THEM IS RATHER BADLY SHAPED THIS YEAR FOR MY HANDSOME JACK DONKEY ATE ONE SIDE OF IT WHEN HE WAS WAITING OUTSIDE THE STUDIO DOOR WHILE HIS CART LOAD OF LOGS FOR THE INGLE FIRE WAS BEING UNLOADED
4434-73958-0015 WHAT A FINE THING AMONG THE CLUSTER ROSES IS THE OLD DUNDEE RAMBLER I TRAINED ONE TO GO UP A RATHER UPRIGHT GREEN HOLLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH
4434-73958-0016 AND NOW IT HAS RUSHED UP AND TUMBLES OUT AT THE TOP AND SIDES IN MASSES OF ITS PRETTY BLOOM IT IS JUST AS GOOD GROWN AS A FOUNTAIN GIVING IT A FREE SPACE WHERE IT CAN SPREAD AT WILL WITH NO TRAINING OR SUPPORT WHATEVER
4434-73958-0017 THESE TWO WAYS I THINK ARE MUCH THE BEST FOR GROWING THE FREE RAMBLING ROSES IN THE CASE OF THE FOUNTAIN THE BRANCHES ARCH OVER AND DISPLAY THE FLOWERS TO PERFECTION
4434-73958-0018 IF YOU TIE YOUR ROSE UP TO A TALL POST OR TRAIN IT OVER AN ARCH OR PERGOLA THE BIRDS FLYING OVERHEAD HAVE THE BEST OF THE SHOW THE GARLAND ROSE ANOTHER OLD SORT IS JUST AS SUITABLE FOR THIS KIND OF GROWTH AS DUNDEE RAMBLER
4434-73958-0019 THE MOST REMARKABLE FOR RAMPANT GROWTH IS R POLYANTHA ONE OF THE BUSHES IN THIS GARDEN COVERS A SPACE THIRTY FOUR FEET ACROSS MORE THAN A HUNDRED FEET ROUND IT FORMS A GREAT FOUNTAIN LIKE MASS
4434-73958-0020 AS THEY MATURE THEY ARCH OVER AND NEXT YEAR THEIR MANY SHORT LATERAL SHOOTS WILL BE SMOTHERED WITH BLOOM TWO OTHER ROSES OF FREE GROWTH ARE ALSO GREAT FAVOURITES MADAME ALFRED CARRIERE WITH LONG STALKED LOOSE WHITE FLOWERS
4434-73958-0021 AND EMILIE PLANTIER I HAVE THEM ON AN EAST FENCE WHERE THEY YIELD A LARGE QUANTITY OF BLOOM FOR CUTTING INDEED THEY HAVE BEEN SO USEFUL IN THIS WAY THAT I HAVE PLANTED SEVERAL MORE
4434-73958-0022 BUT THIS TIME FOR TRAINING DOWN TO AN OAK TRELLIS LIKE THE ONE THAT SUPPORTS THE ROW OF BOUQUET D'OR IN ORDER TO BRING THE FLOWERS WITHIN EASIER REACH NOW WE LOOK FOR THE BLOOM OF THE BURNET ROSE ROSA SPINOSISSIMA
4434-73958-0023 AND NEAR TENBY IN SOUTH WALES FAVOURING WILD PLACES WITHIN SMELL OF THE SEA THE RATHER DUSKY FOLIAGE SETS OFF THE LEMON WHITE OF THE WILD AND THE CLEAR WHITE PINK ROSE AND PALE YELLOW OF THE DOUBLE GARDEN KINDS
4434-73958-0024 THE HIPS ARE LARGE AND HANDSOME BLACK AND GLOSSY AND THE WHOLE PLANT IN LATE AUTUMN ASSUMES A FINE BRONZY COLOURING BETWEEN ASHY BLACK AND DUSKY RED OTHER SMALL OLD GARDEN ROSES ARE COMING INTO BLOOM
4434-73958-0025 ONE OF THE MOST DESIRABLE AND VERY FREQUENT IN THIS DISTRICT IS ROSA LUCIDA
4434-73958-0026 THE LEAVES TURN A BRILLIANT YELLOW IN AUTUMN AND AFTER THEY HAVE FALLEN THE BUSHES ARE STILL BRIGHT WITH THE COLOURED STEMS AND THE LARGE CLUSTERS OF BRIGHT RED HIPS IT IS THE SAINT MARK'S ROSE OF VENICE
4434-73958-0027 WHERE IT IS USUALLY IN FLOWER ON SAINT MARK'S DAY APRIL TWENTY FIFTH THE DOUBLE VARIETY IS THE OLD ROSE D'AMOUR
4434-73958-0028 EVEN WHEN THEIR BEDS ARE AS WELL ENRICHED AS I CAN CONTRIVE OR AFFORD TO MAKE THEM
4434-73958-0029 AND THE HAULAGE IS SO COSTLY THAT WHEN IT ARRIVES I FEEL LIKE DISTRIBUTING IT WITH A SPOON RATHER THAN WITH THE SPADE MOREOVER EVEN IF A BED IS FILLED WITH THE PRECIOUS LOAM
4434-73958-0030 UNLESS CONSTANTLY WATERED THE PLANTS SEEM TO FEEL AND RESENT THE TWO HUNDRED FEET OF DRY SAND AND ROCK THAT IS UNDER THEM BEFORE ANY MOISTER STRATUM IS REACHED BUT THE TEA ROSES ARE MORE ACCOMMODATING AND DO FAIRLY WELL
4434-73958-0031 THOUGH OF COURSE NOT SO WELL AS IN A STIFFER SOIL IF I WERE PLANTING AGAIN I SHOULD GROW A STILL LARGER PROPORTION OF THE KINDS I HAVE NOW FOUND TO DO BEST
4434-73958-0032 GOOD ALIKE EARLY AND LATE AND BEAUTIFUL AT ALL TIMES IN THIS GARDEN IT YIELDS QUITE THREE TIMES AS MUCH BLOOM AS ANY OTHER NOTHING ELSE CAN APPROACH IT EITHER FOR BEAUTY OR BOUNTY
4434-73958-0033 NOT PROPERLY A TEA BUT CLASSED AMONG HYBRID NOISETTES IS ALSO FREE AND BEAUTIFUL AND LONG ENDURING
4434-73958-0034 SO LIKE A DEEPER COLOURED LAMBARD IS ANOTHER FAVOURITE BOUQUET D'OR IS HERE THE STRONGEST OF THE DIJON TEAS I GROW IT IN SEVERAL POSITIONS BUT MOST CONVENIENTLY ON A STRONG BIT OF OAK POST AND RAIL TRELLIS
4434-73958-0035 KEEPING THE LONG GROWTHS TIED DOWN AND EVERY TWO YEARS CUTTING THE OLDEST WOOD RIGHT OUT IT IS WELL TO REMEMBER THAT THE TYING OR PEGGING DOWN OF ROSES ALWAYS MAKES THEM BLOOM BETTER
4434-73958-0036 IN THESE THE LAST YEAR'S GROWTH IS CUT BACK IN MARCH TO WITHIN TWO TO FIVE EYES FROM WHERE IT LEAVES THE MAIN BRANCH ACCORDING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE KIND THIS MUST NOT BE DONE WITH THE TEAS
4434-73958-0037 WITH THESE THE OLDEST WOOD IS CUT RIGHT OUT FROM THE BASE AND THE BLOOMING SHOOTS LEFT FULL LENGTH BUT IT IS WELL TOWARDS THE END OF JULY OR BEGINNING OF AUGUST
4434-73958-0038 FOR AS SOON AS SPRING COMES THEY SHOOT UP WITH GREAT VIGOUR AND WE KNOW THAT THE SPRAY USED TO SUPPORT THEM MUST BE TWO FEET HIGHER THAN FOR THOSE THAT ARE SPRING SOWN THE FLOWER STALKS ARE A FOOT LONG AND MANY HAVE FOUR FLOWERS ON A STALK
4434-73958-0039 THEY ARE SOWN IN SHALLOW TRENCHES IN SPRING THEY ARE EARTHED UP VERY SLIGHTLY BUT STILL WITH A LITTLE TRENCH AT THE BASE OF THE PLANTS A FEW DOSES OF LIQUID MANURE ARE A GREAT HELP WHEN THEY ARE GETTING TOWARDS BLOOMING STRENGTH
4434-73958-0040 OF MY PART OF THE COUNTRY NO BUSH OR TREE NOT EVEN THE APPLE SEEMS TO GROUP SO WELL OR SO CLOSELY WITH FARM BUILDINGS WHEN I BUILT A LONG THATCHED SHED FOR THE MANY NEEDS OF THE GARDEN IN THE REGION OF PITS AND FRAMES
4434-73958-0041 COMPOST RUBBISH AND BURN HEAP I PLANTED ELDERS CLOSE TO THE END OF THE BUILDING AND ON ONE SIDE OF THE YARD THEY LOOK JUST RIGHT AND ARE MOREOVER EVERY YEAR LOADED WITH THEIR USEFUL FRUIT THIS IS RIPE QUITE EARLY IN SEPTEMBER
4434-73958-0042 AND IS MADE INTO ELDER WINE TO BE DRUNK HOT IN WINTER A COMFORT BY NO MEANS TO BE DESPISED MY TREES NOW GIVE ENOUGH FOR MY OWN WANTS AND THERE ARE GENERALLY A FEW ACCEPTABLE BUSHELS TO SPARE FOR MY COTTAGE NEIGHBOURS
4434-73958-0043 AND THEN RIPEN IN A FEW DAYS WHILE LYING ON THE GROUND I SHAKE THE SEEDS CAREFULLY OUT AND LEAVE THEM LYING ROUND THE PARENT PLANT A WEEK LATER WHEN THEY WILL BE RIPE THEY ARE LIGHTLY SCRATCHED INTO THE GROUND SOME YOUNG PLANTS OF LAST YEAR'S GROWTH I MARK WITH A BIT OF STICK
4434-73958-0044 PRIMULA ROSEA SHOULD ALSO BE DIVIDED NOW
4434-73958-0045 SUCH AS THE FOOT OF A NORTH OR EAST WALL OR BE PUT AT ONCE IN ITS PLACE IN SOME COOL RATHER MOIST SPOT IN THE ROCK GARDEN TWO YEAR OLD PLANTS COME UP WITH THICK CLUMPS OF MATTED ROOT THAT IS NOW USELESS
4434-73958-0046 I CUT OFF THE WHOLE MASS OF OLD ROOT ABOUT AN INCH BELOW THE CROWN WHEN IT CAN EASILY BE DIVIDED INTO NICE LITTLE BITS FOR REPLANTING MANY OTHER SPRING FLOWERING PLANTS MAY WITH ADVANTAGE BE DIVIDED NOW SUCH AS AUBRIETIA
4434-73958-0047 THE GREAT BRANCHING MULLEIN VERBASCUM OLYMPICUM IS JUST GOING OUT OF BLOOM AFTER MAKING A BRILLIANT DISPLAY FOR A FORTNIGHT IT IS FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER OF THE MOST USEFUL TALL YELLOW FLOWERED KINDS
4434-73958-0048 V PHLOMOIDES BOTH ARE SEEN AT THEIR BEST EITHER QUITE EARLY IN THE MORNING OR IN THE EVENING OR IN HALF SHADE AS LIKE ALL THEIR KIND THEY DO NOT EXPAND THEIR BLOOM IN BRIGHT SUNSHINE
4434-73958-0049 BUT MEANWHILE THE FOLIAGE IS SO HANDSOME THAT EVEN IF THERE WERE NO FLOWER IT WOULD BE A WORTHY GARDEN PLANT IT DOES WELL IN ANY WASTE SPACES OF POOR SOIL WHERE BY HAVING PLANTS OF ALL AGES
4434-73958-0050 TALL STEMS ONLY CLOTHED WITH UNSIGHTLY GREY RAGS THE CATERPILLARS ARE EASILY CAUGHT WHEN QUITE SMALL OR WHEN RATHER LARGE BUT MIDWAY IN THEIR GROWTH WHEN THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH LONG THEY ARE WARY
4434-73958-0051 AND AT THE APPROACH OF THE AVENGING GARDENER THEY WILL GIVE A SUDDEN WRIGGLING JUMP AND ROLL DOWN INTO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE LARGE FOLIAGE WHERE THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND BUT BY GOING ROUND THE PLANTS TWICE A DAY FOR ABOUT A WEEK THEY CAN ALL BE DISCOVERED
4434-73958-0052 THE WHITE VARIETY OF THE FRENCH WILLOW EPILOBIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM IS A PRETTY PLANT IN THE EDGES OF THE COPSE GOOD BOTH IN SUN AND SHADE AND FLOURISHING IN ANY POOR SOIL
4434-73958-0053 IN BETTER GROUND IT GROWS TOO RANK RUNNING QUICKLY AT THE ROOT AND INVADING ALL ITS NEIGHBOURS SO THAT IT SHOULD BE PLANTED WITH GREAT CAUTION BUT WHEN GROWN ON POOR GROUND IT FLOWERS AT FROM TWO FEET TO FOUR FEET HIGH
4434-73958-0054 AND ITS WHOLE ASPECT IS IMPROVED BY THE PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT OF FLOWER BECOMING MUCH LARGER TOWARDS THE END OF JUNE THE BRACKEN THAT COVERS THE GREATER PART OF THE GROUND OF THE COPSE IS IN FULL BEAUTY
4434-73958-0055 NO OTHER MANNER OF UNDERGROWTH GIVES TO WOODLAND IN SO GREAT A DEGREE THE TRUE FOREST LIKE CHARACTER THIS MOST ANCIENT PLANT SPEAKS OF THE OLD UNTOUCHED LAND OF WHICH LARGE STRETCHES STILL REMAIN IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
4434-73958-0056 LAND TOO POOR TO HAVE BEEN WORTH CULTIVATING AND THAT HAS THEREFORE FOR CENTURIES ENDURED HUMAN CONTEMPT IN THE EARLY PART OF THE PRESENT CENTURY WILLIAM COBBETT IN HIS DELIGHTFUL BOOK RURAL RIDES
4434-73958-0057 AND OF THE GENERAL FEELING OF THE TIME ABOUT LONELY ROADS IN WASTE PLACES AS THE FIELDS FOR THE LAWLESS LABOURS OF SMUGGLER AND HIGHWAYMAN NOW SUCH TRACTS OF NATURAL WILD BEAUTY
4434-73958-0058 CLOTHED WITH STRETCHES OF HEATH AND FERN AND WHORTLEBERRY WITH BEDS OF SPHAGNUM MOSS AND LITTLE NATURAL WILD GARDENS OF CURIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL SUB AQUATIC PLANTS IN THE MARSHY HOLLOWS AND UNDRAINED WASTES
4434-73958-0059 ARE TREASURED AS SUCH PLACES DESERVE TO BE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY STILL REMAIN WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF A VAST CITY THE HEIGHT TO WHICH THE BRACKEN GROWS IS A SURE GUIDE TO THE DEPTH OF SOIL
4434-73958-0060 ON THE POOREST THINNEST GROUND IT ONLY REACHES A FOOT OR TWO BUT IN HOLLOW PLACES WHERE LEAF MOULD ACCUMULATES AND SURFACE SOIL HAS WASHED IN AND MADE A BETTER DEPTH IT GROWS FROM SIX FEET TO EIGHT FEET HIGH
4434-73958-0061 AND WHEN STRAGGLING UP THROUGH BUSHES TO GET TO THE LIGHT A FROND WILL SOMETIMES MEASURE AS MUCH AS TWELVE FEET THE OLD COUNTRY PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALWAYS LIVED ON THE SAME POOR LAND SAY WHERE THE FARN GROWS TALL ANYTHING WILL GROW
4434-73958-0062 BUT THAT ONLY MEANS THAT THERE THE GROUND IS SOMEWHAT BETTER AND CAPABLE OF CULTIVATION AS ITS PRESENCE IS A SURE INDICATION OF A SANDY SOIL THE TIMBER MERCHANTS ARE SHY OF BUYING OAK TREES FELLED FROM AMONG IT
