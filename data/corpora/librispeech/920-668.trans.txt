920-668-0000 CHAPTER ONE THEY ARRIVE AT THE MONASTERY IT WAS A WARM BRIGHT DAY AT THE END OF AUGUST THE INTERVIEW WITH THE ELDER HAD BEEN FIXED FOR HALF PAST ELEVEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER LATE MASS OUR VISITORS DID NOT TAKE PART IN THE SERVICE
920-668-0001 BUT ARRIVED JUST AS IT WAS OVER FIRST AN ELEGANT OPEN CARRIAGE DRAWN BY TWO VALUABLE HORSES DROVE UP WITH MIUESOV AND A DISTANT RELATIVE OF HIS A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY CALLED PYOTR FOMITCH KALGANOV
920-668-0002 THIS YOUNG MAN WAS PREPARING TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY MIUESOV WITH WHOM HE WAS STAYING FOR THE TIME WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM TO GO ABROAD TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH OR JENA THE YOUNG MAN WAS STILL UNDECIDED HE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND ABSENT MINDED
920-668-0003 HE WAS NICE LOOKING STRONGLY BUILT AND RATHER TALL THERE WAS A STRANGE FIXITY IN HIS GAZE AT TIMES LIKE ALL VERY ABSENT MINDED PEOPLE HE WOULD SOMETIMES STARE AT A PERSON WITHOUT SEEING HIM HE WAS SILENT AND RATHER AWKWARD
920-668-0004 BUT SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ALONE WITH ANY ONE HE BECAME TALKATIVE AND EFFUSIVE AND WOULD LAUGH AT ANYTHING OR NOTHING BUT HIS ANIMATION VANISHED AS QUICKLY AS IT APPEARED HE WAS ALWAYS WELL AND EVEN ELABORATELY DRESSED HE HAD ALREADY SOME INDEPENDENT FORTUNE
920-668-0005 AND EXPECTATIONS OF MUCH MORE HE WAS A FRIEND OF ALYOSHA'S IN AN ANCIENT JOLTING BUT ROOMY HIRED CARRIAGE WITH A PAIR OF OLD PINKISH GRAY HORSES A LONG WAY BEHIND MIUESOV'S CARRIAGE
920-668-0006 DMITRI WAS LATE THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INFORMED OF THE TIME THE EVENING BEFORE THE VISITORS LEFT THEIR CARRIAGE AT THE HOTEL OUTSIDE THE PRECINCTS AND WENT TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY ON FOOT EXCEPT FYODOR PAVLOVITCH NONE OF THE PARTY HAD EVER SEEN THE MONASTERY
920-668-0007 AND MIUESOV HAD PROBABLY NOT EVEN BEEN TO CHURCH FOR THIRTY YEARS HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITH CURIOSITY TOGETHER WITH ASSUMED EASE BUT EXCEPT THE CHURCH AND THE DOMESTIC BUILDINGS THOUGH THESE TOO WERE ORDINARY ENOUGH HE FOUND NOTHING OF INTEREST IN THE INTERIOR OF THE MONASTERY
920-668-0008 THE LAST OF THE WORSHIPPERS WERE COMING OUT OF THE CHURCH BAREHEADED AND CROSSING THEMSELVES AMONG THE HUMBLER PEOPLE WERE A FEW OF HIGHER RANK TWO OR THREE LADIES AND A VERY OLD GENERAL THEY WERE ALL STAYING AT THE HOTEL
920-668-0009 OUR VISITORS WERE AT ONCE SURROUNDED BY BEGGARS BUT NONE OF THEM GAVE THEM ANYTHING EXCEPT YOUNG KALGANOV WHO TOOK A TEN COPECK PIECE OUT OF HIS PURSE AND NERVOUS AND EMBARRASSED GOD KNOWS WHY HURRIEDLY GAVE IT TO AN OLD WOMAN SAYING DIVIDE IT EQUALLY
920-668-0010 NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS MADE ANY REMARK UPON IT SO THAT HE HAD NO REASON TO BE EMBARRASSED BUT PERCEIVING THIS HE WAS EVEN MORE OVERCOME IT WAS STRANGE THAT THEIR ARRIVAL DID NOT SEEM EXPECTED AND THAT THEY WERE NOT RECEIVED WITH SPECIAL HONOR
920-668-0011 THOUGH ONE OF THEM HAD RECENTLY MADE A DONATION OF A THOUSAND ROUBLES WHILE ANOTHER WAS A VERY WEALTHY AND HIGHLY CULTURED LANDOWNER UPON WHOM ALL IN THE MONASTERY WERE IN A SENSE DEPENDENT AS A DECISION OF THE LAWSUIT MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT PUT THEIR FISHING RIGHTS IN HIS HANDS
920-668-0012 YET NO OFFICIAL PERSONAGE MET THEM MIUESOV LOOKED ABSENT MINDEDLY AT THE TOMBSTONES ROUND THE CHURCH AND WAS ON THE POINT OF SAYING THAT THE DEAD BURIED HERE MUST HAVE PAID A PRETTY PENNY FOR THE RIGHT OF LYING IN THIS HOLY PLACE BUT REFRAINED
920-668-0013 HIS LIBERAL IRONY WAS RAPIDLY CHANGING ALMOST INTO ANGER WHO THE DEVIL IS THERE TO ASK IN THIS IMBECILE PLACE WE MUST FIND OUT FOR TIME IS PASSING HE OBSERVED SUDDENLY AS THOUGH SPEAKING TO HIMSELF
920-668-0014 ALL AT ONCE THERE CAME UP A BALD HEADED ELDERLY MAN WITH INGRATIATING LITTLE EYES WEARING A FULL SUMMER OVERCOAT LIFTING HIS HAT HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF WITH A HONEYED LISP AS MAXIMOV A LANDOWNER OF TULA
