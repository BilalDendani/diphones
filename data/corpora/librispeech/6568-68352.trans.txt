6568-68352-0000 IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT ALL FRANCE COULD BE PLACED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THERE WOULD BE ROOM ENOUGH LEFT FOR BELGIUM HOLLAND DENMARK AND SWITZERLAND ONE IN EACH CORNER EVEN THEN DELAWARE AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COULD BE PUT IN FOR GOOD MEASURE
6568-68352-0001 ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE DEPEND WHOLLY UPON AGRICULTURE FOR THEIR LIVING INSTEAD OF LIVING ON FARMS AS WE DO THEY LIVE IN SMALL VILLAGES THEIR FARMS ARE VERY SMALL GENERALLY RUNNING FROM TWO TO FIFTEEN ACRES
6568-68352-0002 AS A RULE THE SOIL IS THIN AND UNPRODUCTIVE BUT WITH THEIR PATIENT TOIL CAREFUL METHODS OF FARMING AND A VERY LIBERAL USE OF FERTILIZER THEY RAISE ABUNDANT CROPS
6568-68352-0003 THE BALANCE IS IN FORESTS AND STREAMS HIGHWAYS CANALS AND RAILWAYS WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT THERE WERE ABOUT FOUR MILLION FRENCH FAMILIES WHO OWNED THEIR HOMES AND A THRIFTIER AND MORE INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE COULD HARDLY BE FOUND IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE
6568-68352-0004 BESIDES THE PROVINCES OF ALSACE AND LORRAINE HE THOUGHT HE HAD THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE THROTTLED FOR A GENERATION BUT TO HIS VERY GREAT AMAZEMENT EVERY DOLLAR OF THIS HUGE SUM WAS PAID IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS
6568-68352-0005 THIS FACT IS BUT AN INDICATION THAT THE FRENCH ARE A RACE OF SAVERS A SILENT REVOLUTION IN THE HABITS OF THE PEASANT PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR AGES AGO AN UPRISING TOOK THE LAND AWAY FROM WEALTHY OWNERS AND GAVE IT TO THE PEASANTS
6568-68352-0006 A FEW YEARS LATER NAPOLEON HAD ENACTED OR RATHER ESTABLISHED A CODE BY WHICH A MAN'S PROPERTY WAS EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HIS CHILDREN THUS IF A MAN DIED LEAVING FOUR CHILDREN AND AN EIGHT ACRE FARM IT WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR STRIPS OF TWO ACRES EACH
6568-68352-0007 THEN IN THE COURSE OF TIME ONE OF THESE CHILDREN DIED LEAVING FOUR CHILDREN HIS TWO ACRE FARM WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR STRIPS OF A HALF ACRE EACH THUS A GREAT PORTION OF THE LAND IS CUT UP INTO LITTLE STRIPS AND GARDENS
6568-68352-0008 OFTEN MILES FROM EACH OTHER THIS OFTEN BROUGHT COMPLICATIONS AND MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE MODERN FARM IMPLEMENTS AND DO AWAY WITH MUCH OF THE DRUDGERY OF PEASANT LIFE THIS IS ONE ADVANTAGE THAT GREW OUT OF THE WAR IN MANY PLACES
6568-68352-0009 IN THE DEVASTATED AREAS ALL LANDMARKS WERE OFTEN OBLITERATED AND IN MANY CASES THE GOVERNMENT BROUGHT IN TRACTORS AND PLOWED GREAT FIELDS WHICH BEFORE THE WAR WERE HUNDREDS OF LITTLE FARMS AND GARDENS
6568-68352-0010 NO ORDINARY FARMER EVER BECAME ABLE TO HAVE MODERN FARM IMPLEMENTS HIMSELF AND THEY NEVER DREAMED THAT SEVERAL OF THEM COULD GO TOGETHER AND PURCHASE A BINDER A THRESHER OR TRACTOR THEIR ONE STANDBY WAS THE HOE
6568-68352-0011 AND NOT ONLY THE MAN BUT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN OFTEN HAD TO WORK FROM DAYLIGHT UNTIL DARK TO KEEP THE WOLF FROM THE DOOR SINCE THE WAR A NEW DAY HAS DAWNED FOR THE FRENCH PEASANTRY IT WAS VERY HARD FOR SOME OF THEM TO GIVE UP THEIR OLD NOTIONS AND CUSTOMS
6568-68352-0012 BUT IT MEANT A NEW ORDER FOR ALL WHO WERE IN THE PATHWAY OF THE WAR
6568-68352-0013 THEY HAD NO AMUSEMENTS NO DAILY PAPERS AND IN SOME PLACES NO SONGS THE FAMOUS MAN WITH THE HOE IS A PICTURE OF THE FRENCH FARMER IN MANY OF THE REBUILT VILLAGES NOW THEY HAVE AMUSEMENTS AND MOVIES AND IN MANY CASES PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN STARTED
6568-68352-0014 IT IS SAID THAT IN MANY OF THE FARMHOUSES OF THE FRENCH PEASANTRY MAY BE SEEN HANGING LITTLE COLORED PRINTS REPRESENTING THE MAIN PROFESSIONS AT THE TOP OF A STAIRWAY STANDS A KING WITH THE MOTTO I RULE YOU ALL ON A STEP BELOW IS A PRIEST WHO SAYS
6568-68352-0015 I PRAY FOR YOU ALL STILL FARTHER DOWN STANDS THE SOLDIER WHO SAYS I DEFEND YOU ALL
6568-68352-0016 I FEED YOU ALL THE FRENCH PEASANT SEEMED TO TAKE THIS FOR GRANTED AND NEVER IMAGINED THAT WHILE DOING IT HE MIGHT HAVE ADVANTAGES AND PLEASURES THAT WOULD HELP TO MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING OF COURSE THERE ARE GREAT INDUSTRIES AND INDUSTRIAL CENTERS IN FRANCE THE CITY OF LILLE
6568-68352-0017 WAS BEFORE THE WAR THE PITTSBURG OF FRANCE THIS CITY WAS NOT ONLY THE CENTER OF THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY BUT HAD SCORES AND HUNDREDS OF FACTORIES AND MACHINE SHOPS OF ALL KINDS WHILE THE CITY ITSELF WAS NOT TOTALLY DESTROYED THE FACTORIES WERE ALMOST COMPLETELY RUINED
6568-68352-0018 IN SOME CASES RAILROAD TRACKS WERE LAID INTO THE BUILDINGS AND WHOLE TRAINLOADS OF COSTLY MACHINERY WERE SHIPPED OUT OF THE COUNTRY I SAW THE INSIDE OF MANY OF THESE BUILDINGS WHERE HIGH EXPLOSIVES WERE USED AND ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS THE SHELL OF THE BUILDING THE INSIDE BEING ONE MASS
6568-68352-0019 OF TWISTED IRON GIRDERS AND BROKEN CONCRETE OF COURSE THE IDEA OF THE ENEMY WAS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR FRENCH FACTORIES TO EVER AGAIN COMPETE WITH THEIR OWN SO THEY ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY ALL THEY LEFT THEY ESPECIALLY LOOKED AFTER ALL PATTERNS AND PLANS AND THOUGHT THEY WERE MAKING A CLEAN SWEEP
6568-68352-0020 IN ONE CASE A GREAT FACTORY THAT COVERED SIXTY ACRES OF GROUND WAS DESTROYED BUT THE OWNERS HAD A BRANCH FACTORY IN SOUTHERN FRANCE AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN MANUFACTURING DUPLICATE MACHINERY SO THAT WHEN THE WAR CLOSED
6568-68352-0021 ALL THAT WAS NEEDED WAS THE TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES TO GET THE MACHINERY TO LILLE
6568-68352-0022 THERE WERE COAL MINES IN THE DISTRICT AT ALL THE WRITER WENT OVER THESE RUINS AFTER THE WAR CLOSED AND IT IS SIMPLY BEYOND THE IMAGINATION TO PICTURE THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS AT THAT TIME THE COURSE OF SMALL RIVERS AND STREAMS WERE CHANGED SO THAT THE WATER COULD BE RUN INTO THESE MINES
6568-68352-0023 ONE QUITE REMARKABLE DISTINCTION IS NOTICEABLE TO A STRANGER GOING THROUGH FRANCE
6568-68352-0024 THE LAND MAY BE FARMED ON ALL SIDES UP TO THE FACTORY BUILDINGS THE MEN OFTEN WORK IN THESE FACTORIES WHILE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND OLD MEN DO THE WORK ON THE FARMS PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN FRANCE ARE NOTED FOR THE BEAUTIFUL VINEYARDS BORDEAUX AND OTHER BRANDS OF WINE ARE FAMOUS THE WORLD AROUND
6568-68352-0025 SOME OF OUR BOYS ARE LAUGHING YET ABOUT THE FRENCH METHODS OF MAKING WINE THE GRAPES ARE GATHERED AND PILED INTO A GREAT VAT WHEN THIS RECEPTACLE IS FILLED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN TAKE OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOST ALL OF THEIR CLOTHES AND CLIMB IN
6568-68352-0026 HERE THEY WALK AND JUMP AND TRAMP UNTIL THE WHOLE THING IS A MASS OF PULP
6568-68352-0027 AFTER ALL THE WINE HAS BEEN EXTRACTED BY THESE VARIOUS METHODS THEY USE THE PULP IN THE MANUFACTURE OF A POWERFUL INTOXICANT BUT THIS IS NOT GENERALLY USED AS A BEVERAGE
6568-68352-0028 OF COURSE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT IN MANY PLACES THEY HAVE MODERN MACHINERY AND MAKE WINE ALONG SCIENTIFIC LINES BUT IN MANY CASES THEY USE THESE OLD METHODS TO THIS DAY
6568-68352-0029 EVEN IN THE DARKEST DAYS THEIR FAITH NEVER WAVERED AND THEY FIRMLY BELIEVED THEY WOULD BE VICTORIOUS AS A MONUMENT OF THIS FAITH THERE IS IN PARIS TODAY THE MOST WONDERFUL PAINTING PERHAPS THAT WAS EVER PUT UPON CANVAS IT IS CALLED THE PANTHEON DE GUERRE
6568-68352-0030 AND IS A MARVELOUS CYCLORAMIC PAINTING OF THE WAR IT WAS OPENED UP TO THE PUBLIC SOON AFTER THE ARMISTICE WAS SIGNED AND THE WRITER SAW IT WHILE ATTENDING THE PEACE CONFERENCE MANY REMEMBER THE WONDERFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG WHICH USED TO BE IN CHICAGO
6568-68352-0031 THIS PARIS CYCLORAMA IS ALONG THE SAME LINE BUT TEN TIMES MORE WONDERFUL IT IS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE AND FORTY FIVE HIGH THE ACTUAL PREPARATION OF THIS BEGAN IN OCTOBER NINETEEN FOURTEEN
6568-68352-0032 AND WHILE THE ARMY OF THE INVADERS WAS WITHIN THIRTY MILES OF PARIS AND THE BIG GUNS WERE SHAKING THE CITY MORE THAN TWENTY ARTISTS WERE WORKING ON THE MARVELOUS PRODUCTION THE CENTRAL FIGURE IS A WOMAN MOUNTED UPON A HIGH PEDESTAL WHICH STANDS IN FRONT OF A HUGE TEMPLE
6568-68352-0033 AND SHE IS HOLDING ALOFT THE LAUREL WREATH OF VICTORY UPON THE FIRST STEP OF A GIANT STAIRWAY WHICH LEADS TO THE TEMPLE IS A GROUP OF FRENCH HEROES
6568-68352-0034 FOCH PETAIN AND MANY OTHERS WHILE IN FRONT OF THEM ARE GUNS AND FLAGS BEARING MARKS OF CONFLICT THE ONLY ALLUSION TO GERMANY IN THE WHOLE PAINTING IS IN THE BATTLE SCARRED FLAGS AND GUNS WHICH WERE USED IN THE FIRST BATTLE OF THE MARNE
6568-68352-0035 UPON THIS GIGANTIC STAIRWAY ARE LIFE SIZE FIGURES OF MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE NEARLY EVERYONE OF WHICH IS A LIFE SKETCH OF SOME FRENCH HERO OF THE WAR AMONG THEM ARE MANY WOMEN WHOSE HEROIC WORK AND INFLUENCE WILL LIVE FOREVER
6568-68352-0036 AT THE BASE AND ON THE STEPS IS A WOMAN DRESSED IN MOURNING KNEELING IN THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER WHILE NEARBY IS A WREATH INSCRIBED TO THE UNKNOWN DEAD BACK OF THE TOMB IN THE DISTANCE
6568-68352-0037 YOU CAN SEE THE RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN AND IN SOME INDESCRIBABLE WAY THEY ARE LIGHTING UP THE FACES OF THOSE ON THE TEMPLE STAIRWAY LIKE A BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW OF PROMISE WHILE THE TOMB ITSELF IS LEFT IN THE SHADOWS OF THE DECLINING DAY
6568-68352-0038 IN THE GROUP REPRESENTING BELGIUM IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT EDITH CAVIL SHOULD HAVE A PROMINENT PLACE TO BE SURE KING ALBERT AND HIS QUEEN AND OTHERS ARE THERE AS IN BELGIUM THE FIRST CASUALTIES OCCURRED
6568-68352-0039 IT IS FITTING THAT HERE ALONE IS SEEN A WOUNDED MAN AND THE RED CROSS WORKERS ARE CARING FOR HIM AS HE LIES UPON A STRETCHER HERE TOO ARE SEEN THE BROKEN PIECES OF A CATHEDRAL TOWER WITH A CHALICE AND ALTAR AND CARDINAL MERCIER IN HIS PRIESTLY ROBES
6568-68352-0040 WHILE LYING ON THE STEPS BETWEEN HIM AND THE KING IS THE TORN SCRAP OF PAPER BUT IT WOULD TAKE PAGES OF THIS BOOK TO GIVE AN ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION OF THE ENTIRE PANORAMA OF COURSE ALL THE ALLIES ARE REPRESENTED
6568-68352-0041 IN A GROUP REPRESENTING THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT WILSON IS ONE OF THE CHIEF FIGURES I AM TOLD THAT THE PICTURE OF GENERAL PERSHING IS A LIFE SIZED PAINTING WHICH HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO SIT FOR TO BE USED IN THIS PRODUCTION
6568-68352-0042 HERE IS ALSO SEEN AN AMERICAN INDIAN A COWBOY A MERCHANT AND AN ARTISAN AN AMERICAN FLAG IS BORNE ALOFT WHILE FOUR WEST POINT CADETS SUGGEST TRAINING AND LEADERSHIP WOMEN RELIEF WORKERS OF ALL KINDS ARE SEEN
6568-68352-0043 THEN EXTENDING ENTIRELY AROUND THE ROOM ABOVE AND BACK OF ALL THESE GROUPS IS A PROFILE MAP OF FRANCE FROM THE CHANNEL TO THE SWISS BORDER HERE CAN BE SEEN THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS AND CITIES INVOLVED DURING THE WAR HERE TOO CAN BE SEEN ALL THE MODERN IMPLEMENTS OF WAR
6568-68352-0044 AND EVERYTHING IS ACTUAL OR LIFE SIZE AS I STOOD GAZING UPON THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCTION OF ARTISTIC GENIUS
6568-68352-0045 PRIDE BEAUTY INDIGNATION MOURNING GENIUS ART SCIENCE INVENTION GENERALSHIP STATESMANSHIP HONOR LOVE TENDERNESS DEVOTION HEROISM AND GLORY
6568-68352-0046 ARE ALL INTERMINGLED IN A MOST MARVELOUS WAY THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEHOLD
6568-68352-0047 THEN TO THINK OF THE FAITH AND COURAGE IT MUST HAVE TAKEN TO WORK ON AND ON WHILE THE SHELLS FROM THE BIG GUNS WERE BURSTING AT REGULAR INTERVALS DURING THE DAY AND THE BOMBS DROPPING FROM THE AEROPLANES ABOVE AT NIGHT
