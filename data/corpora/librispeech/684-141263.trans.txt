684-141263-0000 AND CONSEQUENTLY NONE BUT THE MOST ELEMENTARY STUDIES WERE AT THAT TIME SUITED TO HIS YEARS OF COURSE IT WAS NOT THE DUTY OF GENERAL MENESIUS TO ATTEND PERSONALLY TO THE INSTRUCTION OF HIS LITTLE PUPIL IN THESE THINGS
684-141263-0001 GENERAL MENESIUS RESIDED IN THE PALACE WITH HIS CHARGE
684-141263-0002 THAT IS WITH ALL WHO BELONGED TO OR WERE CONNECTED WITH HIS MOTHER'S BRANCH OF THE FAMILY WITH THOSE WHO WERE CONNECTED WITH THE CHILDREN OF ALEXIS FIRST WIFE HE WAS AN OBJECT OF CONTINUAL JEALOUSY AND SUSPICION
684-141263-0003 THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE TWO BRANCHES OF THE FAMILY BECAME MORE DECIDED THAN EVER AND WHEN SOPHIA OBTAINED HER RELEASE FROM THE CONVENT AND MANAGED TO GET THE CONTROL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
684-141263-0004 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEODORE'S IMBECILITY AS RELATED IN THE FIRST CHAPTER ONE OF THE FIRST SOURCES OF UNEASINESS FOR HER IN RESPECT TO THE CONTINUANCE OF HER POWER WAS THE PROBABILITY THAT PETER WOULD GROW UP TO BE A TALENTED
684-141263-0005 AND ENERGETIC YOUNG MAN AND WOULD SOONER OR LATER TAKE THE GOVERNMENT INTO HIS OWN HANDS SHE REVOLVED IN HER MIND MANY PLANS FOR PREVENTING THIS THE ONE WHICH SEEMED TO HER MOST FEASIBLE AT FIRST
684-141263-0006 WAS TO ATTEMPT TO SPOIL THE BOY BY INDULGENCE AND LUXURY SHE ACCORDINGLY IT IS SAID ATTEMPTED TO INDUCE MENESIUS TO ALTER THE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH HE HAD MADE FOR PETER SO AS TO RELEASE HIM FROM RESTRAINT
684-141263-0007 AND ALLOW HIM TO DO AS HE PLEASED HER PLAN WAS ALSO TO SUPPLY HIM WITH MEANS OF PLEASURE AND INDULGENCE VERY FREELY THINKING THAT A BOY OF HIS AGE WOULD NOT HAVE THE GOOD SENSE OR THE RESOLUTION TO RESIST THESE TEMPTATIONS
684-141263-0008 THUS SHE THOUGHT THAT HIS PROGRESS IN STUDY WOULD BE EFFECTUALLY IMPEDED AND THAT PERHAPS HE WOULD UNDERMINE HIS HEALTH AND DESTROY HIS CONSTITUTION BY EATING AND DRINKING
684-141263-0009 OR BY OTHER HURTFUL INDULGENCES BUT SOPHIA FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT INDUCE GENERAL MENESIUS TO CO OPERATE WITH HER IN ANY SUCH PLANS HE HAD SET HIS HEART ON MAKING HIS PUPIL
684-141263-0010 AND TO HAVE ANOTHER ARRANGEMENT MADE FOR THE BOY BY WHICH SHE THOUGHT HER ENDS WOULD BE ATTAINED SO MENESIUS BADE HIS YOUNG CHARGE FAREWELL NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT GIVING HIM IN PARTING
684-141263-0011 MOST URGENT COUNSELS TO PERSEVERE AS HE HAD BEGUN IN THE FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTY TO RESIST EVERY TEMPTATION TO IDLENESS OR EXCESS AND TO DEVOTE HIMSELF WHILE YOUNG WITH PATIENCE
684-141263-0012 PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY TO THE WORK OF STORING HIS MIND WITH USEFUL KNOWLEDGE AND OF ACQUIRING EVERY POSSIBLE ART AND ACCOMPLISHMENT WHICH COULD BE OF ADVANTAGE TO HIM WHEN HE BECAME A MAN
684-141263-0013 AFTER GENERAL MENESIUS HAD BEEN DISMISSED SOPHIA ADOPTED AN ENTIRELY NEW SYSTEM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PETER BEFORE THIS TIME THEODORE HAD DIED AND PETER IN CONJUNCTION WITH JOHN
684-141263-0014 HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED EMPEROR SOPHIA GOVERNING AS REGENT IN THEIR NAMES THE PRINCESS NOW MADE AN ARRANGEMENT FOR ESTABLISHING PETER IN A HOUSEHOLD OF HIS OWN AT A PALACE SITUATED IN A SMALL VILLAGE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM MOSCOW
684-141263-0015 HAVE FALLEN INTO THE SNARE SO ADROITLY LAID FOR THEM AND BEEN RUINED BUT PETER ESCAPED IT WHETHER IT WAS FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE COUNSELS AND INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS FORMER GOVERNOR OR FROM HIS OWN NATIVE GOOD SENSE
684-141263-0016 HE EVEN CONTRIVED TO TURN THE HOURS OF PLAY AND THE COMPANIONS WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM AS MERE INSTRUMENTS OF PLEASURE INTO MEANS OF IMPROVEMENT
684-141263-0017 AND LEARNED WITH THEM ALL THE EVOLUTIONS AND PRACTICED ALL THE DISCIPLINE NECESSARY IN A CAMP
684-141263-0018 HE CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE TAUGHT TO DRUM NOT MERELY AS MOST BOYS DO JUST TO MAKE A NOISE FOR HIS AMUSEMENT BUT REGULARLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY SO AS TO ENABLE HIM TO UNDERSTAND AND EXECUTE ALL THE BEATS AND SIGNALS USED IN CAMP
684-141263-0019 AND THE WHEELBARROW WITH WHICH HE WORKED IN MAKING THE FORTIFICATION WAS ONE WHICH HE HAD CONSTRUCTED WITH HIS OWN HANDS HE DID NOT ASSUME ANY SUPERIORITY OVER HIS COMPANIONS IN THESE EXERCISES BUT TOOK HIS PLACE AMONG THEM AS AN EQUAL
684-141263-0020 OBEYING THE COMMANDS WHICH WERE GIVEN TO HIM WHEN IT CAME TO HIS TURN TO SERVE AND TAKING HIS FULL SHARE OF ALL THE HARDEST OF THE WORK WHICH WAS TO BE DONE NOR WAS THIS ALL MERE BOYS PLAY
684-141263-0021 PURSUED FOR A LITTLE TIME AS LONG AS THE NOVELTY LASTED AND THEN THROWN ASIDE FOR SOMETHING MORE AMUSING PETER KNEW THAT WHEN HE BECAME A MAN HE WOULD BE EMPEROR OF ALL RUSSIA
684-141263-0022 HE KNEW THAT AMONG THE POPULATIONS OF THAT IMMENSE COUNTRY THERE WERE A GREAT MANY WILD AND TURBULENT TRIBES HALF SAVAGE IN HABITS AND CHARACTER THAT WOULD NEVER BE CONTROLLED BUT BY MILITARY FORCE AND THAT THE COUNTRY TOO
684-141263-0023 WAS SURROUNDED BY OTHER NATIONS THAT WOULD SOMETIMES UNLESS HE WAS WELL PREPARED FOR THEM ASSUME A HOSTILE ATTITUDE AGAINST HIS GOVERNMENT AND PERHAPS MAKE GREAT AGGRESSIONS UPON HIS TERRITORIES
684-141263-0024 OR TO WHEEL EARTH AND CONSTRUCT FORTIFICATIONS WITH HIS OWN HANDS STILL LESS TO MAKE THE WHEELBARROWS BY WHICH THE WORK WAS TO BE DONE BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT HE COULD SUPERINTEND THESE THINGS FAR MORE INTELLIGENTLY AND SUCCESSFULLY
684-141263-0025 IF HE KNEW IN DETAIL PRECISELY HOW EVERY THING OUGHT TO BE DONE AND THAT WAS THE REASON WHY HE TOOK SO MUCH PAINS TO LEARN HIMSELF HOW TO DO THEM AS HE GREW OLDER HE CONTRIVED TO INTRODUCE HIGHER AND HIGHER BRANCHES OF MILITARY ART INTO THE SCHOOL
684-141263-0026 AND TO IMPROVE AND PERFECT THE ORGANIZATION OF IT IN EVERY WAY AFTER A WHILE HE ADOPTED IMPROVED UNIFORMS AND EQUIPMENTS FOR THE PUPILS
684-141263-0027 AS FAST AS HE HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS ADVANCED IN YEARS AND IN POWER OF APPRECIATING STUDIES MORE AND MORE ELEVATED THE RESULT WAS THAT WHEN AT LENGTH HE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
684-141263-0028 AND THE TIME ARRIVED FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE PLACE THE INSTITUTION HAD BECOME COMPLETELY ESTABLISHED
684-141263-0029 AND IT CONTINUED IN SUCCESSFUL OPERATION AS SUCH FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
684-141263-0030 THAT SO MANY OF THE LEADING NOBLES ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO HIS CAUSE
684-141263-0031 AND TAKE THE POWER INTO HIS OWN HANDS
