7107-245689-0000 QUESTION SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE THINGS WHICH BELONG TO THE POWERS OF THE SOUL IN GENERAL IN EIGHT ARTICLES WE PROCEED TO CONSIDER THOSE THINGS WHICH BELONG TO THE POWERS OF THE SOUL
7107-245689-0001 FIRST IN GENERAL SECONDLY IN PARTICULAR UNDER THE FIRST HEAD THERE ARE EIGHT POINTS OF INQUIRY ONE WHETHER THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL IS ITS POWER TWO
7107-245689-0002 WHETHER THERE IS ONE POWER OF THE SOUL OR SEVERAL THREE HOW THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER FOUR OF THE ORDERS OF THE POWERS ONE TO ANOTHER
7107-245689-0003 FIVE WHETHER THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE IN IT AS IN THEIR SUBJECT SIX WHETHER THE POWERS FLOW FROM THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL SEVEN
7107-245689-0004 FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS
7107-245689-0005 THAT MIND KNOWLEDGE AND LOVE ARE IN THE SOUL SUBSTANTIALLY OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING ESSENTIALLY
7107-245689-0006 FURTHER THE SOUL IS NOBLER THAN PRIMARY MATTER BUT PRIMARY MATTER IS ITS OWN POTENTIALITY MUCH MORE THEREFORE IS THE SOUL ITS OWN POWER
7107-245689-0007 FURTHER THE SUBSTANTIAL FORM IS SIMPLER THAN THE ACCIDENTAL FORM A SIGN OF WHICH IS THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL FORM IS NOT INTENSIFIED OR RELAXED BUT IS INDIVISIBLE BUT THE ACCIDENTAL FORM IS ITS OWN POWER
7107-245689-0008 FURTHER WE SENSE BY THE SENSITIVE POWER AND WE UNDERSTAND BY THE INTELLECTUAL POWER BUT THAT BY WHICH WE FIRST SENSE AND UNDERSTAND IS THE SOUL ACCORDING TO THE PHILOSOPHER
7107-245689-0009 FURTHER WHATEVER DOES NOT BELONG TO THE ESSENCE IS AN ACCIDENT THEREFORE IF THE POWER OF THE SOUL IS SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES THE ESSENCE THEREOF IT IS AN ACCIDENT WHICH IS CONTRARY TO AUGUSTINE WHO SAYS THAT THE FOREGOING
7107-245689-0010 ARE NOT IN THE SOUL AS IN A SUBJECT AS COLOR OR SHAPE OR ANY OTHER QUALITY OR QUANTITY ARE IN A BODY FOR WHATEVER IS SO DOES NOT EXCEED THE SUBJECT IN WHICH IT IS
7107-245689-0011 FURTHER A SIMPLE FORM CANNOT BE A SUBJECT BUT THE SOUL IS A SIMPLE FORM SINCE IT IS NOT COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM AS WE HAVE SAID ABOVE QUESTION SEVENTY FIVE
7107-245689-0012 THEREFORE THE POWER OF THE SOUL CANNOT BE IN IT AS IN A SUBJECT
7107-245689-0013 FIRST BECAUSE SINCE POWER AND ACT DIVIDE BEING AND EVERY KIND OF BEING WE MUST REFER A POWER AND ITS ACT TO THE SAME GENUS THEREFORE IF THE ACT BE NOT IN THE GENUS OF SUBSTANCE
7107-245689-0014 THE POWER DIRECTED TO THAT ACT CANNOT BE IN THE GENUS OF SUBSTANCE NOW THE OPERATION OF THE SOUL IS NOT IN THE GENUS OF SUBSTANCE FOR THIS BELONGS TO GOD ALONE WHOSE OPERATION IS HIS OWN SUBSTANCE WHEREFORE
7107-245689-0015 IS THE DIVINE ESSENCE ITSELF THIS CANNOT BE TRUE EITHER OF THE SOUL
7107-245689-0016 WHATEVER HAS A SOUL WOULD ALWAYS HAVE ACTUAL VITAL ACTIONS AS THAT WHICH HAS A SOUL IS ALWAYS AN ACTUALLY LIVING THING FOR AS A FORM THE SOUL IS NOT AN ACT ORDAINED TO A FURTHER ACT
7107-245689-0017 WHICH POTENTIALITY HOWEVER DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE SOUL THEREFORE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL IS NOT ITS POWER FOR NOTHING IS IN POTENTIALITY BY REASON OF AN ACT AS ACT
7107-245689-0018 AUGUSTINE IS SPEAKING OF THE MIND AS IT KNOWS AND LOVES ITSELF THUS KNOWLEDGE AND LOVE AS REFERRED TO THE SOUL AS KNOWN AND LOVED ARE SUBSTANTIALLY OR ESSENTIALLY IN THE SOUL
7107-245689-0019 FOR THE VERY SUBSTANCE OR ESSENCE OF THE SOUL IS KNOWN AND LOVED IN THE SAME WAY ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAYS IN THE OTHER PASSAGE THAT THOSE THINGS ARE ONE LIFE ONE MIND ONE ESSENCE OR AS SOME SAY
7107-245689-0020 THIS PASSAGE IS TRUE IN THE SENSE IN WHICH THE POTENTIAL WHOLE IS PREDICATED OF ITS PARTS BEING MIDWAY BETWEEN THE UNIVERSAL WHOLE AND THE INTEGRAL WHOLE FOR THE UNIVERSAL WHOLE IS IN EACH PART ACCORDING TO ITS ENTIRE ESSENCE AND POWER
7107-245689-0021 THEREFORE IN NO WAY CAN IT BE PREDICATED OF EACH PART YET IN A WAY IT IS PREDICATED THOUGH IMPROPERLY OF ALL THE PARTS TOGETHER AS IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT THE WALL ROOF
7107-245689-0022 AND FOUNDATIONS ARE A HOUSE BUT THE POTENTIAL WHOLE IS IN EACH PART ACCORDING TO ITS WHOLE ESSENCE NOT HOWEVER ACCORDING TO ITS WHOLE POWER
7107-245689-0023 THEREFORE IN A WAY IT CAN BE PREDICATED OF EACH PART BUT NOT SO PROPERLY AS THE UNIVERSAL WHOLE IN THIS SENSE AUGUSTINE SAYS THAT THE MEMORY UNDERSTANDING AND THE WILL ARE THE ONE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
7107-245689-0024 AS DOES EXISTENCE FOR TO ACT BELONGS TO WHAT EXISTS NOW THE COMPOSITE HAS SUBSTANTIAL EXISTENCE THROUGH THE SUBSTANTIAL FORM AND IT OPERATES BY THE POWER WHICH RESULTS FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL FORM
7107-245689-0025 HENCE AN ACTIVE ACCIDENTAL FORM IS TO THE SUBSTANTIAL FORM OF THE AGENT FOR INSTANCE HEAT COMPARED TO THE FORM OF FIRE AS THE POWER OF THE SOUL IS TO THE SOUL
7107-245689-0026 THAT THE ACCIDENTAL FORM IS A PRINCIPLE OF ACTION IS DUE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL FORM
7107-245689-0027 BUT NOT THE PROXIMATE PRINCIPLE IN THIS SENSE THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS THAT THE SOUL IS THAT WHEREBY WE UNDERSTAND AND SENSE
7107-245689-0028 IF WE TAKE ACCIDENT AS MEANING WHAT IS DIVIDED AGAINST SUBSTANCE THEN THERE CAN BE NO MEDIUM BETWEEN SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT BECAUSE THEY ARE DIVIDED BY AFFIRMATION AND NEGATION THAT IS
7107-245689-0029 ACCORDING TO EXISTENCE IN A SUBJECT AND NON EXISTENCE IN A SUBJECT IN THIS SENSE AS THE POWER OF THE SOUL IS NOT ITS ESSENCE IT MUST BE AN ACCIDENT
7107-245689-0030 WHEREAS WHATEVER IS BEYOND THE ESSENCE OF A THING CANNOT BE CALLED ACCIDENT IN THIS SENSE BUT ONLY WHAT IS NOT CAUSED BY THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE OF THE SPECIES FOR THE PROPER DOES NOT BELONG TO THE ESSENCE OF A THING
7107-245689-0031 BUT IS CAUSED BY THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF THE SPECIES WHEREFORE IT IS A MEDIUM BETWEEN THE ESSENCE AND ACCIDENT THUS UNDERSTOOD
7107-245689-0032 WHEN AUGUSTINE SAYS THAT KNOWLEDGE AND LOVE ARE NOT IN THE SOUL AS ACCIDENTS IN A SUBJECT THIS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE SENSE GIVEN ABOVE INASMUCH AS THEY ARE COMPARED TO THE SOUL NOT AS LOVING AND KNOWING
7107-245689-0033 BUT AS LOVED AND KNOWN HIS ARGUMENT PROCEEDS IN THIS SENSE FOR IF LOVE WERE IN THE SOUL LOVED AS IN A SUBJECT IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT AN ACCIDENT TRANSCENDS ITS SUBJECT SINCE EVEN OTHER THINGS ARE LOVED THROUGH THE SOUL
7107-245689-0034 ALTHOUGH THE SOUL IS NOT COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM YET IT HAS AN ADMIXTURE OF POTENTIALITY AS WE HAVE SAID ABOVE QUESTION SEVENTY FIVE
7107-245689-0035 AND FOR THIS REASON IT CAN BE THE SUBJECT OF AN ACCIDENT THE STATEMENT QUOTED IS VERIFIED IN GOD WHO IS THE PURE ACT
7107-245689-0036 RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE AS DIFFERENCES ARE NOT TAKEN FROM THE POWERS OF SENSE AND REASON BUT FROM THE SENSITIVE AND RATIONAL SOUL ITSELF BUT BECAUSE SUBSTANTIAL FORMS WHICH IN THEMSELVES ARE UNKNOWN TO US
7107-245689-0037 ARE KNOWN BY THEIR ACCIDENTS
7107-245689-0038 FURTHER TO OPERATE BELONGS TO WHAT IS IN ACT BUT BY THE ONE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL MAN HAS ACTUAL EXISTENCE IN THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF PERFECTION AS WE HAVE SEEN ABOVE QUESTION SEVENTY SIX
7107-245689-0039 THEREFORE BY THE ONE POWER OF THE SOUL HE PERFORMS OPERATIONS OF VARIOUS DEGREES ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER PLACES SEVERAL POWERS IN THE SOUL
7107-245689-0040 I ANSWER THAT OF NECESSITY WE MUST PLACE SEVERAL POWERS IN THE SOUL TO MAKE THIS EVIDENT WE OBSERVE THAT AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
7107-245689-0041 THE LOWEST ORDER OF THINGS CANNOT ACQUIRE PERFECT GOODNESS BUT THEY ACQUIRE A CERTAIN IMPERFECT GOODNESS BY FEW MOVEMENTS AND THOSE WHICH BELONG TO A HIGHER ORDER ACQUIRE PERFECT GOODNESS BY MANY MOVEMENTS
7107-245689-0042 AND THOSE YET HIGHER ACQUIRE PERFECT GOODNESS BY FEW MOVEMENTS AND THE HIGHEST PERFECTION IS FOUND IN THOSE THINGS WHICH ACQUIRE PERFECT GOODNESS WITHOUT ANY MOVEMENT WHATEVER
7107-245689-0043 THUS HE IS LEAST OF ALL DISPOSED OF HEALTH WHO CAN ONLY ACQUIRE IMPERFECT HEALTH BY MEANS OF A FEW REMEDIES BETTER DISPOSED IS HE WHO CAN ACQUIRE PERFECT HEALTH
7107-245689-0044 BY MEANS OF MANY REMEDIES AND BETTER STILL HE WHO CAN BY FEW REMEDIES BEST OF ALL IS HE WHO HAS PERFECT HEALTH WITHOUT ANY REMEDIES
7107-245689-0045 BUT MAN CAN ACQUIRE UNIVERSAL AND PERFECT GOODNESS BECAUSE HE CAN ACQUIRE BEATITUDE YET HE IS IN THE LAST DEGREE ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE OF THOSE TO WHOM BEATITUDE IS POSSIBLE
7107-245689-0046 THEREFORE THE HUMAN SOUL REQUIRES MANY AND VARIOUS OPERATIONS AND POWERS BUT TO ANGELS A SMALLER VARIETY OF POWERS IS SUFFICIENT IN GOD THERE IS NO POWER OR ACTION BEYOND HIS OWN ESSENCE
7107-245689-0047 THERE IS YET ANOTHER REASON WHY THE HUMAN SOUL ABOUNDS IN A VARIETY OF POWERS BECAUSE IT IS ON THE CONFINES OF SPIRITUAL AND CORPOREAL CREATURES AND THEREFORE THE POWERS OF BOTH MEET TOGETHER IN THE SOUL
7107-245689-0048 THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL APPROACHES TO THE DIVINE LIKENESS MORE THAN INFERIOR CREATURES IN BEING ABLE TO ACQUIRE PERFECT GOODNESS ALTHOUGH BY MANY AND VARIOUS MEANS AND IN THIS IT FALLS SHORT
7107-245689-0049 OF MORE PERFECT CREATURES
7107-245689-0050 BUT A MULTIFORM POWER IS SUPERIOR TO IT IF IT IS OVER MANY THINGS
7107-245689-0051 ONE THING HAS ONE SUBSTANTIAL EXISTENCE
7107-245689-0052 FOR NOTHING IS DETERMINED TO ITS SPECIES BY WHAT IS SUBSEQUENT AND EXTRINSIC TO IT BUT THE ACT IS SUBSEQUENT TO THE POWER AND THE OBJECT IS EXTRINSIC TO IT
7107-245689-0053 THEREFORE THE SOUL'S POWERS ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY DISTINCT BY ACTS AND OBJECTS
7107-245689-0054 FURTHER CONTRARIES ARE WHAT DIFFER MOST FROM EACH OTHER THEREFORE IF THE POWERS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR OBJECTS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SAME POWER COULD NOT HAVE CONTRARY OBJECTS
7107-245689-0055 THIS IS CLEARLY FALSE IN ALMOST ALL THE POWERS FOR THE POWER OF VISION EXTENDS TO WHITE AND BLACK AND THE POWER TO TASTE TO SWEET AND BITTER
7107-245689-0056 FURTHER IF THE CAUSE BE REMOVED THE EFFECT IS REMOVED HENCE IF THE DIFFERENCE OF POWERS CAME FROM THE DIFFERENCE OF OBJECTS THE SAME OBJECT WOULD NOT COME UNDER DIFFERENT POWERS
7107-245689-0057 THIS IS CLEARLY FALSE FOR THE SAME THING IS KNOWN BY THE COGNITIVE POWER AND DESIRED BY THE APPETITIVE
7107-245689-0058 BELONG ALSO TO SOME ONE POWER AS SOUND AND COLOR BELONG TO SIGHT AND HEARING WHICH ARE DIFFERENT POWERS YET THEY COME UNDER THE ONE POWER OF COMMON SENSE
7107-245689-0059 THEREFORE THE POWERS ARE NOT DISTINGUISHED ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENCE OF THEIR OBJECTS ON THE CONTRARY THINGS THAT ARE SUBSEQUENT ARE DISTINGUISHED BY WHAT PRECEDES BUT THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
7107-245689-0060 I ANSWER THAT A POWER AS SUCH IS DIRECTED TO AN ACT WHEREFORE WE SEEK TO KNOW THE NATURE OF A POWER FROM THE ACT TO WHICH IT IS DIRECTED
7107-245689-0061 AND CONSEQUENTLY THE NATURE OF A POWER IS DIVERSIFIED AS THE NATURE OF THE ACT IS DIVERSIFIED NOW THE NATURE OF AN ACT IS DIVERSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS NATURES OF THE OBJECTS
7107-245689-0062 WHICH IS THE END OF GROWTH NOW FROM THESE TWO THINGS AN ACT RECEIVES ITS SPECIES NAMELY FROM ITS PRINCIPLE OR FROM ITS END OR TERM FOR THE ACT OF HEATING DIFFERS FROM THE ACT OF COOLING
7107-245689-0063 THEREFORE THE POWERS ARE OF NECESSITY DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR ACTS AND OBJECTS NEVERTHELESS WE MUST OBSERVE THAT THINGS WHICH ARE ACCIDENTAL DO NOT CHANGE THE SPECIES
7107-245689-0064 FOR SINCE TO BE COLORED IS ACCIDENTAL TO AN ANIMAL ITS SPECIES IS NOT CHANGED BY A DIFFERENCE OF COLOR BUT BY A DIFFERENCE IN THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE NATURE OF AN ANIMAL
7107-245689-0065 WHICH IS SOMETIMES RATIONAL AND SOMETIMES OTHERWISE HENCE RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL ARE DIFFERENCES DIVIDING ANIMAL CONSTITUTING ITS VARIOUS SPECIES IN LIKE MANNER THEREFORE
7107-245689-0066 NOT ANY VARIETY OF OBJECTS DIVERSIFIES THE POWERS OF THE SOUL BUT A DIFFERENCE IN THAT TO WHICH THE POWER OF ITS VERY NATURE IS DIRECTED
7107-245689-0067 THUS THE SENSES OF THEIR VERY NATURE ARE DIRECTED TO THE PASSIVE QUALITY WHICH OF ITSELF IS DIVIDED INTO COLOR SOUND AND THE LIKE AND THEREFORE THERE IS ONE SENSITIVE POWER WITH REGARD TO COLOR
7107-245689-0068 NAMELY THE SIGHT AND ANOTHER WITH REGARD TO SOUND NAMELY HEARING BUT IT IS ACCIDENTAL TO A PASSIVE QUALITY FOR INSTANCE TO SOMETHING COLORED TO BE A MUSICIAN OR A GRAMMARIAN
7107-245689-0069 ACT THOUGH SUBSEQUENT IN EXISTENCE TO POWER IS NEVERTHELESS PRIOR TO IT IN INTENTION AND LOGICALLY AS THE END IS WITH REGARD TO THE AGENT AND THE OBJECT
7107-245689-0070 BUT THE POWER OF THE SOUL DOES NOT REGARD THE NATURE OF THE CONTRARY AS SUCH BUT RATHER THE COMMON ASPECT OF BOTH CONTRARIES AS SIGHT DOES NOT REGARD WHITE AS SUCH BUT AS COLOR
7107-245689-0071 THIS IS BECAUSE OF TWO CONTRARIES ONE IN A MANNER INCLUDES THE IDEA OF THE OTHER SINCE THEY ARE TO ONE ANOTHER AS PERFECT AND IMPERFECT
7107-245689-0072 NOTHING PREVENTS THINGS WHICH COINCIDE IN SUBJECT FROM BEING CONSIDERED UNDER DIFFERENT ASPECTS THEREFORE THEY CAN BELONG TO VARIOUS POWERS OF THE SOUL
7107-245689-0073 THE HIGHER POWER OF ITSELF REGARDS A MORE UNIVERSAL FORMALITY OF THE OBJECT THAN THE LOWER POWER BECAUSE THE HIGHER A POWER IS TO A GREATER NUMBER OF THINGS DOES IT EXTEND
7107-245689-0074 THEREFORE MANY THINGS ARE COMBINED IN THE ONE FORMALITY OF THE OBJECT WHICH THE HIGHER POWER CONSIDERS OF ITSELF WHILE THEY DIFFER IN THE FORMALITIES REGARDED BY THE LOWER POWERS OF THEMSELVES
7107-245689-0075 THUS IT IS THAT VARIOUS OBJECTS BELONG TO VARIOUS LOWER POWERS WHICH OBJECTS HOWEVER
7107-245689-0076 THERE IS NO BEFORE AND AFTER BUT ALL ARE NATURALLY SIMULTANEOUS BUT THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE CONTRADISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER THEREFORE THERE IS NO ORDER AMONG THEM
7107-245689-0077 FURTHER THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE REFERRED TO THEIR OBJECTS AND TO THE SOUL ITSELF ON THE PART OF THE SOUL THERE IS NOT ORDER AMONG THEM BECAUSE THE SOUL IS ONE
7107-245689-0078 FURTHER WHERE THERE IS ORDER AMONG POWERS WE FIND THAT THE OPERATION OF ONE DEPENDS ON THE OPERATION OF ANOTHER BUT THE ACTION OF ONE POWER OF THE SOUL DOES NOT DEPEND ON THAT OF ANOTHER
7107-245689-0079 AND THE POWERS ARE MANY AND SINCE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT PROCEED FROM ONE MUST PROCEED IN A CERTAIN ORDER THERE MUST BE SOME ORDER AMONG THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ACCORDINGLY WE MAY OBSERVE A TRIPLE ORDER AMONG THEM
7107-245689-0080 WHILE THE THIRD IS TAKEN FROM THE ORDER OF THE OBJECTS NOW THE DEPENDENCE OF ONE POWER ON ANOTHER CAN BE TAKEN IN TWO WAYS ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF NATURE
7107-245689-0081 FORASMUCH AS PERFECT THINGS ARE BY THEIR NATURE PRIOR TO IMPERFECT THINGS AND ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF GENERATION AND TIME FORASMUCH AS FROM BEING IMPERFECT A THING COMES TO BE PERFECT
7107-245689-0082 THUS ACCORDING TO THE FIRST KIND OF ORDER AMONG THE POWERS THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS ARE PRIOR TO THE SENSITIVE POWERS WHEREFORE THEY DIRECT THEM AND COMMAND THEM
7107-245689-0083 FOR THE POWERS OF THE NUTRITIVE SOUL ARE PRIOR BY WAY OF GENERATION TO THE POWERS OF THE SENSITIVE SOUL FOR WHICH THEREFORE THEY PREPARE THE BODY THE SAME IS TO BE SAID OF THE SENSITIVE POWERS WITH REGARD TO THE INTELLECTUAL
7107-245689-0084 BUT IN THE THIRD KIND OF ORDER CERTAIN SENSITIVE POWERS ARE ORDERED AMONG THEMSELVES NAMELY SIGHT HEARING AND SMELLING FOR THE VISIBLE NATURALLY COMES FIRST
7107-245689-0085 THE SPECIES OF A GIVEN GENUS ARE TO ONE ANOTHER AS BEFORE AND AFTER LIKE NUMBERS AND FIGURES IF CONSIDERED IN THEIR NATURE ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE SAID TO BE SIMULTANEOUS
7107-245689-0086 THIS ORDER AMONG THE POWERS OF THE SOUL IS BOTH ON THE PART OF THE SOUL WHICH
7107-245689-0087 THIS ARGUMENT IS VERIFIED AS REGARDS THOSE POWERS AMONG WHICH
7107-245689-0088 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ALL THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE IN THE SOUL AS THEIR SUBJECT FOR AS THE POWERS OF THE BODY ARE TO THE BODY SO ARE THE POWERS OF THE SOUL TO THE SOUL
7107-245689-0089 BUT THE BODY IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CORPOREAL POWERS THEREFORE THE SOUL IS THE SUBJECT OF THE POWERS OF THE SOUL
7107-245689-0090 FURTHER THE OPERATIONS OF THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE BODY BY REASON OF THE SOUL
7107-245689-0091 NOT THROUGH THE BODY IN FACT WITHOUT THE BODY AS FEAR AND SUCH LIKE AND SOME THINGS THROUGH THE BODY BUT IF THE SENSITIVE POWERS WERE NOT IN THE SOUL ALONE AS THEIR SUBJECT
7107-245689-0092 THE SOUL COULD NOT SENSE ANYTHING WITHOUT THE BODY THEREFORE THE SOUL IS THE SUBJECT OF THE SENSITIVE POWERS
7107-245689-0093 OF ALL THE OTHER POWERS ON THE CONTRARY
7107-245689-0094 I ANSWER THAT THE SUBJECT OF OPERATIVE POWER IS THAT WHICH IS ABLE TO OPERATE FOR EVERY ACCIDENT DENOMINATES ITS PROPER SUBJECT NOW THE SAME IS THAT WHICH IS ABLE TO OPERATE
7107-245689-0095 AND THAT WHICH DOES OPERATE WHEREFORE THE SUBJECT OF POWER IS OF NECESSITY THE SUBJECT OF OPERATION AS AGAIN THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS IN THE BEGINNING OF
7107-245689-0096 AS SIGHT BY THE EYE AND HEARING BY THE EAR AND SO IT IS WITH ALL THE OTHER OPERATIONS OF THE NUTRITIVE AND SENSITIVE PARTS
7107-245689-0097 THEREFORE THE POWERS WHICH ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF THESE OPERATIONS HAVE THEIR SUBJECT IN THE COMPOSITE AND NOT IN THE SOUL ALONE
7107-245689-0098 ALL THE POWERS ARE SAID TO BELONG TO THE SOUL NOT AS THEIR SUBJECT BUT AS THEIR PRINCIPLE BECAUSE IT IS BY THE SOUL THAT THE COMPOSITE HAS THE POWER TO PERFORM SUCH OPERATIONS
7107-245689-0099 PLATO'S OPINION WAS THAT SENSATION IS AN OPERATION PROPER TO THE SOUL JUST AS UNDERSTANDING IS NOW IN MANY THINGS RELATING TO PHILOSOPHY AUGUSTINE MAKES USE OF THE OPINIONS OF PLATO
7107-245689-0100 NOT ASSERTING THEM AS TRUE BUT RELATING THEM HOWEVER AS FAR AS THE PRESENT QUESTION IS CONCERNED WHEN IT IS SAID THAT THE SOUL SENSES SOME THINGS WITH THE BODY AND SOME WITHOUT THE BODY
7107-245689-0101 THIS CAN BE TAKEN IN TWO WAYS FIRSTLY THE WORDS WITH THE BODY OR WITHOUT THE BODY MAY DETERMINE THE ACT OF SENSE IN ITS MODE OF PROCEEDING FROM THE SENTIENT
7107-245689-0102 THUS THE SOUL SENSES NOTHING WITHOUT THE BODY BECAUSE THE ACTION OF SENSATION CANNOT PROCEED FROM THE SOUL EXCEPT BY A CORPOREAL ORGAN SECONDLY
7107-245689-0103 SINCE THEREFORE THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE MANY AND VARIOUS THEY CANNOT PROCEED FROM ITS ESSENCE
7107-245689-0104 THEREFORE THE SOUL DOES NOT PRODUCE ITS POWERS WITHIN ITSELF ON THE CONTRARY THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE ITS NATURAL PROPERTIES
7107-245689-0105 THEREFORE THE POWERS OF THE SOUL PROCEED FROM ITS ESSENCE AS THEIR CAUSE I ANSWER THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL AND THE ACCIDENTAL FORM PARTLY AGREE AND PARTLY DIFFER
7107-245689-0106 THEY AGREE IN THIS THAT EACH IS AN ACT AND THAT BY EACH OF THEM
7107-245689-0107 ACTUAL THEY DIFFER HOWEVER IN TWO RESPECTS
7107-245689-0108 AND ITS SUBJECT IS SOMETHING PURELY POTENTIAL BUT THE ACCIDENTAL FORM DOES NOT MAKE A THING TO EXIST ABSOLUTELY BUT TO BE SUCH OR SO GREAT OR IN SOME PARTICULAR CONDITION
7107-245689-0109 WHEREFORE THE ACTUALITY OF THE ACCIDENTAL FORM IS CAUSED BY THE ACTUALITY OF THE SUBJECT SO THE SUBJECT FORASMUCH AS IT IS IN POTENTIALITY IS RECEPTIVE OF THE ACCIDENTAL FORM
7107-245689-0110 THE ACCIDENT BEING CAUSED BY AN EXTRINSIC AGENT SECONDLY SUBSTANTIAL AND ACCIDENTAL FORMS DIFFER BECAUSE
7107-245689-0111 SINCE THAT WHICH IS THE LESS PRINCIPAL EXISTS FOR THE SAKE OF THAT WHICH IS THE MORE PRINCIPAL MATTER THEREFORE EXISTS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SUBSTANTIAL FORM
7107-245689-0112 NOW IT IS CLEAR
7107-245689-0113 OR ELSE THIS SUBJECT IS THE COMPOSITE NOW THE COMPOSITE IS ACTUAL BY THE SOUL WHENCE IT IS CLEAR THAT ALL THE POWERS OF THE SOUL WHETHER THEIR SUBJECT BE THE SOUL ALONE OR THE COMPOSITE
7107-245689-0114 FLOW FROM THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL AS FROM THEIR PRINCIPLE BECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID THAT THE ACCIDENT IS CAUSED BY THE SUBJECT ACCORDING AS IT IS ACTUAL AND IS RECEIVED INTO IT ACCORDING AS IT IS IN POTENTIALITY
7107-245689-0115 IN A CERTAIN ORDER OR AGAIN IF THERE BE DIVERSITY OF RECIPIENTS THUS FROM THE ONE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL MANY AND VARIOUS POWERS PROCEED BOTH BECAUSE ORDER EXISTS AMONG THESE POWERS
7107-245689-0116 AND ALSO BY REASON OF THE DIVERSITY OF THE CORPOREAL ORGANS
7107-245689-0117 FROM THIS WE MAY GATHER THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL IS THE CAUSE OF ALL ITS POWERS
7107-245689-0118 AND AS THEIR ACTIVE PRINCIPLE AND OF SOME AS RECEPTIVE THEREOF
7107-245689-0119 ONE OF THEM DOES NOT ARISE FROM ANOTHER BUT ALL THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE CREATED AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE SOUL THEREFORE ONE OF THEM DOES NOT ARISE FROM ANOTHER
7107-245689-0120 THEREFORE ONE POWER DOES NOT ARISE FROM ANOTHER
7107-245689-0121 FURTHER ONE OPPOSITE DOES NOT ARISE FROM THE OTHER OPPOSITE BUT EVERYTHING ARISES FROM THAT WHICH IS LIKE IT IN SPECIES NOW THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE OPPOSITELY DIVIDED AS VARIOUS SPECIES
7107-245689-0122 THEREFORE ONE OF THEM DOES NOT PROCEED FROM ANOTHER ON THE CONTRARY POWERS ARE KNOWN BY THEIR ACTIONS BUT THE ACTION OF ONE POWER IS CAUSED BY THE ACTION OF ANOTHER POWER
7107-245689-0123 THAT AMONG THE POWERS OF THE SOUL THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS OF ORDER THEREFORE ONE POWER OF THE SOUL PROCEEDS FROM THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL BY THE MEDIUM OF ANOTHER
7107-245689-0124 IT FOLLOWS THAT THOSE POWERS OF THE SOUL WHICH PRECEDE THE OTHERS
7107-245689-0125 ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE OTHERS AFTER THE MANNER OF THE END AND ACTIVE PRINCIPLE FOR WE SEE THAT THE SENSES ARE FOR THE SAKE OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND NOT THE OTHER WAY ABOUT THE SENSES MOREOVER
7107-245689-0126 ARE A CERTAIN IMPERFECT PARTICIPATION OF THE INTELLIGENCE WHEREFORE ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL ORIGIN THEY PROCEED FROM THE INTELLIGENCE AS THE IMPERFECT FROM THE PERFECT BUT CONSIDERED AS RECEPTIVE PRINCIPLES
7107-245689-0127 AND AS SOMETHING MATERIAL WITH REGARD TO THE INTELLIGENCE ON THIS ACCOUNT THE MORE IMPERFECT POWERS PRECEDE THE OTHERS IN THE ORDER OF GENERATION FOR THE ANIMAL IS GENERATED BEFORE THE MAN
7107-245689-0128 AS THE POWER OF THE SOUL FLOWS FROM THE ESSENCE NOT BY A TRANSMUTATION BUT BY A CERTAIN NATURAL RESULTANCE AND IS SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE SOUL SO IS IT THE CASE WITH ONE POWER AS REGARDS ANOTHER
7107-245689-0129 AN ACCIDENT CANNOT OF ITSELF BE THE SUBJECT OF AN ACCIDENT BUT ONE ACCIDENT IS RECEIVED PRIOR TO ANOTHER INTO SUBSTANCE AS QUANTITY PRIOR TO QUALITY IN THIS SENSE
7107-245689-0130 ONE ACCIDENT IS SAID TO BE THE SUBJECT OF ANOTHER AS SURFACE IS OF COLOR INASMUCH AS SUBSTANCE RECEIVES AN ACCIDENT THROUGH THE MEANS OF ANOTHER THE SAME THING MAY BE SAID OF THE POWERS OF THE SOUL
7107-245689-0131 THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE OPPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER AS PERFECT AND IMPERFECT AS ALSO ARE THE SPECIES OF NUMBERS AND FIGURES BUT THIS OPPOSITION DOES NOT PREVENT THE ORIGIN OF ONE FROM ANOTHER
7107-245689-0132 FURTHER THE POWERS EVEN OF THE SENSITIVE SOUL ARE NOT WEAKENED WHEN THE BODY BECOMES WEAK
7107-245689-0133 THEREFORE THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE NOT CORRUPTED WHEN THE BODY IS CORRUPTED BUT REMAIN IN THE SEPARATED SOUL
7107-245689-0134 ONE BUT MEMORY REMAINS IN THE SEPARATED SOUL FOR IT WAS SAID TO THE RICH GLUTTON WHOSE SOUL WAS IN HELL REMEMBER THAT THOU DIDST RECEIVE GOOD THINGS DURING THY LIFETIME
7107-245689-0135 FURTHER JOY AND SORROW ARE IN THE CONCUPISCIBLE PART WHICH IS A POWER OF THE SENSITIVE SOUL
7107-245689-0136 BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SEPARATE SOULS GRIEVE OR REJOICE AT THE PAINS OR REWARDS WHICH THEY RECEIVE THEREFORE THE CONCUPISCIBLE POWER REMAINS IN THE SEPARATE SOUL
7107-245689-0137 BUT THE IMAGINATION IS A POWER OF THE SENSITIVE PART THEREFORE THE POWER OF THE SENSITIVE PART REMAINS IN THE SEPARATE SOUL AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL THE OTHER POWERS ON THE CONTRARY IT IS SAID
7107-245689-0138 THAT OF TWO SUBSTANCES ONLY DOES MAN CONSIST THE SOUL WITH ITS REASON AND THE BODY WITH ITS SENSES THEREFORE THE BODY BEING DEAD
7107-245689-0139 THE SENSITIVE POWERS DO NOT REMAIN I ANSWER THAT AS WE HAVE SAID ALREADY
7107-245689-0140 ALL THE POWERS OF THE SOUL BELONG TO THE SOUL ALONE AS THEIR PRINCIPLE BUT SOME POWERS BELONG TO THE SOUL ALONE AS THEIR SUBJECT AS THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE WILL
7107-245689-0141 THESE POWERS MUST REMAIN IN THE SOUL AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BODY BUT OTHER POWERS ARE SUBJECTED IN THE COMPOSITE
7107-245689-0142 BUT THEY REMAIN VIRTUALLY IN THE SOUL AS IN THEIR PRINCIPLE OR ROOT SO IT IS FALSE THAT AS SOME SAY THESE POWERS REMAIN IN THE SOUL EVEN AFTER THE CORRUPTION OF THE BODY
7107-245689-0143 IT IS MUCH MORE FALSE THAT AS THEY SAY ALSO THE ACTS OF THESE POWERS REMAIN IN THE SEPARATE SOUL BECAUSE THESE POWERS HAVE NO ACT APART
7107-245689-0144 THAT BOOK HAS NO AUTHORITY AND SO WHAT IS THERE WRITTEN CAN BE DESPISED WITH THE SAME FACILITY AS IT WAS SAID ALTHOUGH WE MAY SAY THAT THE SOUL TAKES WITH ITSELF THESE POWERS
7107-245689-0145 THESE POWERS ARE SAID NOT TO BE WEAKENED WHEN THE BODY BECOMES WEAK BECAUSE THE SOUL REMAINS UNCHANGEABLE AND IS THE VIRTUAL PRINCIPLE OF THESE POWERS
7107-245689-0146 THE RECOLLECTION SPOKEN OF THERE IS TO BE TAKEN IN THE SAME WAY AS AUGUSTINE
7107-245689-0147 PLACES MEMORY IN THE MIND NOT AS A PART OF THE SENSITIVE SOUL
