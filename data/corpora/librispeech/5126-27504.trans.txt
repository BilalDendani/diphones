5126-27504-0003 AND TO HAND THEM OVER TO THE TREASURER OF THE TURON HOSPITAL WHICH WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE SIR FERDINAND AND THE POLICE HAD BEEN DECOYED AWAY PREVIOUSLY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED MILES BY FALSE INTELLIGENCE AS TO MORAN AND HIS GANG
5126-27504-0004 OUR TOWN AND TREASURE WERE THUS LEFT UNDEFENDED FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS WHILE A DARING CRIMINAL AND HIS ASSOCIATES MINGLED UNSUSPECTED WITH ALL CLASSES WE HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED THE PRESENT SYSTEM
5126-27504-0005 ARE CONFINED TO A SHORT SHRIFT AND A HIGH GALLOWS FOR ALL WHO DARE TO OBSTRUCT THE QUEEN'S HIGHWAY
5126-27504-0006 TAKING HIS PIPE OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND LAYING IT DOWN THAT'S THE WAY THEY USED TO TALK TO US IN THE OLD DAYS DASHED IF I DON'T THINK IT'S THE BEST WAY AFTER ALL YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE THE REST'S FLUMMERY
5126-27504-0007 WHY SAYS FATHER GETTING UP AND GLARING WITH HIS EYES BECAUSE I WAS A BLIND IGNORANT DOG WHEN I WAS YOUNG AS HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT NOTHING AND KNOWED NOTHING NOT SO MUCH AS HIM THERE POINTING TO CRIB
5126-27504-0008 AND FALLS BACKARDS AND BREAKS HIS NECK IF HE AIN'T WATCHED WHOSE BUSINESS WAS IT TO HAVE LEARNED ME BETTER THAT I CAN'T RIGHTLY SAY BUT IT SEEMED IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE TO GAOL ME AND IRON ME AND FLOG ME WAS THAT JUSTICE
5126-27504-0009 IT'S BEEN THEM AND ME FOR IT SINCE I GOT MY LIBERTY
5126-27504-0010 WE NONE OF US FELT IN THE HUMOUR TO SAY MUCH AFTER THAT FATHER HAD GOT INTO ONE OF HIS TANTRUMS AND WHEN HE DID HE WAS FIT TO BE TIED ONLY I'D NOT HAVE TOOK THE CONTRACT FOR SOMETHING
5126-27504-0011 ONLY EVERY NOW AND THEN HE'D LET OUT JUST AS HE DID NOW AS IF NOTHING COULD EVER SET HIM STRAIGHT AGAIN OR KEEP HIM FROM FIGHTING AGAINST THEM AS HE CALLED THE SWELLS AND THE GOVERNMENT AND EVERYBODY ALMOST THAT WAS STRAIGHTGOING AND HONEST
5126-27504-0012 SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE FOUND THAT THINGS HAD BEEN MADE HOTTER FOR US THAN EVER SINCE WE FIRST TURNED OUT GO WHERE WE WOULD WE FOUND THE POLICE ALWAYS QUICK ON OUR TRAIL
5126-27504-0013 IT LOOKED AS IF OUR LUCK WAS DEAD OUT AND WE BEGAN TO THINK OUR CHANCE OF GETTING ACROSS THE BORDER TO QUEENSLAND AND CLEAR OUT OF THE COLONY THAT WAY LOOKED WORSE EVERY DAY DAD KEPT FORAGING ABOUT TO GET INFORMATION
5126-27504-0014 SIR FERDINAND WAS ALWAYS ON THE MOVE BUT WE KNEW HE COULDN'T DO IT ALL HIMSELF UNLESS HE GOT THE OFFICE FROM SOME ONE WHO KNEW THE ROPES BETTER THAN HE DID LAST OF ALL WE DROPPED ON TO IT THERE WAS ONE OF THE GOLDFIELDS COMMISSIONERS
5126-27504-0015 HE'D LOST SOME GOLD BY US IN THE ESCORT ROBBERY AND NOT FORGOTTEN IT SO IT SEEMS HE'D BEEN TRYING HIS BEST TO FIT US EVER SINCE JUST AT FIRST HE WASN'T ABLE FOR MUCH BUT LATER ON HE MANAGED TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT US AND OUR BEAT
5126-27504-0016 BESIDES THAT WE FELT SAVAGE ABOUT HIS TRYING TO RUN US IN OF COURSE IT WAS HIS DUTY AND THAT OF ALL MAGISTRATES AND COMMISSIONERS IN A GENERAL WAY BUT HE WASN'T AN OFFICER OF POLICE AND
5126-27504-0017 SO WHEN ALL CAME TO ALL WE MADE UP OUR MINDS TO LEARN HIM A LESSON TO STICK TO HIS OWN WORK BESIDES A THOUSAND OUNCES OF GOLD WAS NO FOOLISH TOUCH AND WE COULD KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE
5126-27504-0018 WHILE WE SNEAKED UP WE COULDN'T GET NEAR THOUGH WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT FOR HE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF SPORTING DOGS
5126-27504-0019 OF COURSE HE WAS ON HIS GUARD THEN AND BEFORE LONG THE BULLETS BEGAN TO FLY PRETTY THICK AMONG US AND WE HAD TO TAKE COVER TO RETURN FIRE AND KEEP AS DARK AS WE COULD
5126-27504-0020 WE BLAZED AWAY TOO AND AS THERE WAS NO STABLE AT THE BACK WE SURROUNDED THE HOUSE AND TRIED HARD TO FIND AN OPENING
5126-27504-0021 WE ALL HAD A CLOSE SHAVE MORE THAN ONCE FOR BEING TOO FAST
5126-27504-0022 AT LAST WE DREW LOTS WHICH SHOULD TRY AND GET UP CLOSE TO THE PLACE
5126-27504-0023 THE LOT FELL UPON PATSEY DALY GOOD BYE ALL HE SAID I'M DASHED IF I DON'T THINK KNIGHTLEY WILL BAG ME I DON'T HALF LIKE CHARGING HIM AND THAT'S GOD'S TRUTH
5126-27504-0024 ANYHOW I'LL TRY FOR THAT BARREL THERE AND IF I GET BEHIND IT I CAN FIRE FROM SHORT RANGE AND MAKE HIM COME OUT HE MADE A RUSH HALF ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND MANAGED TO GET BEHIND THIS BARREL WHERE HE WAS SAFE FROM BEING HIT AS LONG AS HE KEPT WELL BEHIND IT
5126-27504-0025 THEN HE PEPPERED AWAY RIGHT AND LEFT ON THE LEFT OF THE VERANDAH THERE WAS A DOOR STOOD PARTLY OPEN AND AFTER A BIT A MAN IN A LIGHT OVERCOAT AND A WHITE HAT LIKE MISTER KNIGHTLEY ALWAYS WORE SHOWED HIMSELF FOR A SECOND
5126-27504-0026 DALY RAPS AWAY AT THIS AND THE MAN STAGGERS AND FALLS PATSEY SHOWS HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT FROM BEHIND THE CASK THINKING TO MAKE A RUSH FORWARD THAT MINUTE MISTER KNIGHTLEY WHO WAS WATCHING HIM FROM A WINDOW THE OTHER WAS ONLY AN IMAGE
5126-27504-0027 LETS DRIVE AT HIM COOL AND STEADY AND POOR PATSEY DROPS LIKE A COCK AND NEVER RAISED HIS HEAD AGAIN HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE BODY HE LINGERED A BIT BUT IN LESS THAN AN HOUR HE WAS A DEAD MAN
5126-27504-0028 ONLY I COULD SEE THAT HIS FACE HAD THAT SET LOOK HE ONLY GOT NOW AND THEN AND HIS EYES BEGAN TO SHOW OUT A FIERCE LIGHT AT LAST WE BEGAN TO SEE THAT THE RETURN FIRE WAS SLACKING OFF WHILE OURS WAS AS BRISK AS EVER
5126-27504-0029 WHICH HAD BEEN FETCHED IN FOR A SLEEPER OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WE PICKED IT UP AND TAKING A RUN BACK BROUGHT IT WITH ALL ITS WEIGHT AGAINST THE FRONT DOOR IN IT WENT LIKE A SHEET OF BARK
5126-27504-0030 IT SEEMED VERY QUEER AND STRANGE EVERYTHING WAS SO SILENT AND QUIET WE HALF EXPECTED ANOTHER VOLLEY BUT NOTHING CAME WE COULD ONLY STAND AND WAIT THE OTHERS HAD GONE ROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE
5126-27504-0031 THERE'S NO SAYING WHAT MISTER KNIGHTLEY MIGHT DO IF HIS WIFE HAD BEEN HERE THANK GOD SHE'S AWAY AT BATHURST SAID STARLIGHT I HATE SEEING WOMEN PUT OUT BESIDES EVERYBODY BOWS DOWN TO MISSUS KNIGHTLEY SHE'S AS GOOD AS SHE'S HANDSOME I BELIEVE AND
5126-27504-0032 THAT'S SAYING A GREAT DEAL JUST THEN MORAN AND WALL MANAGED TO FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND THEY CAME TEARING INTO THE HALL LIKE A PAIR OF COLTS THEY LOOKED RATHER QUEER WHEN THEY SAW US THREE AND NO ONE ELSE
5126-27504-0033 COULDN'T THINK OF GOING BEFORE THE CAPTAIN SAYS MORAN WITH A GRIN I'LL FOLLOW WHERE YOU LEAD ALL RIGHT SAYS STARLIGHT HERE GOES AND HE STARTED TO WALK UPSTAIRS
5126-27504-0034 WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE STOPPED AND LOOKED UP AS IF SOMETHING HAD SURPRISED HIM ABOVE A BIT THEN HE STEPPED BACK AND WAITED I NOTICED HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND LEANED AGAINST THE WALL IT WAS AN OLD FASHIONED HOUSE FOR THAT PART OF THE WORLD
5126-27504-0035 BUILT A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO BY A RICH SETTLER WHO WAS ONCE THE OWNER OF ALL THAT SIDE OF THE COUNTRY THE STAIRCASE WAS ALL STONE ORNAMENTED EVERY WAY IT COULD BE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE COULD WALK ABREAST EASY ENOUGH
5126-27504-0036 ALL OF A SUDDEN APPEARED FOUR PEOPLE INCLINED BY THEIR WAYS TO COME DOWN TO WHERE WE WERE WHILE WE WERE ALL WONDERING FOR A REASON YOU'LL SEE AFTERWARDS
5126-27504-0037 AT ANY RATE HELPING THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AND THEY ALL WALKED QUITE SOLEMN AND STEADY LIKE DOWN THE STAIRS TOGETHER IT WAS A STRANGE SIGHT
5126-27504-0038 THERE WE WERE STANDING AND LEANING ABOUT THE DARK HALL STARING AND WONDERING AND THESE PEOPLE WALKING DOWN TO MEET US LIKE GHOSTS WITHOUT SPEAKING OR ANYTHING ELSE MISTER KNIGHTLEY WAS A TALL HANDSOME MAN
5126-27504-0039 WITH A GRAND BLACK BEARD THAT CAME DOWN TO HIS CHEST HE WALKED LIKE A LORD AND HAD THAT KIND OF MANNER WITH HIM THAT COMES TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN USED TO BE WAITED ON AND HAVE EVERYTHING FOUND FOR THEM IN THIS WORLD AS FOR HIS WIFE
5126-27504-0040 SHE WAS GIVEN IN TO BE THE HANDSOMEST WOMAN IN THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE TALL AND GRACEFUL WITH A BEAUTIFUL SMILE AND SOFT FAIR HAIR EVERYBODY LIKED AND RESPECTED HER GENTLE AND SIMPLE
5126-27504-0041 AND I CAN'T SAY MORE THAN THAT SO AS I SAID BEFORE IT WAS QUITE A PICTURE TO SEE THEM WALK SLOWLY AND PROUDLY DOWN AND SWEEP INTO THE HALL AS IF THEY'D BEEN MARCHING INTO A BALLROOM
5126-27504-0042 AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE ONE OF OUR BAND LAY DEAD BESIDE THE INNER WALL KILLED BY HIS HAND WHAT WAS TO BE HIS DOOM AND WHO COULD SAY HOW SUCH A PLAY MIGHT END I LOOKED AT OUR MEN
5126-27504-0043 AS THEY STEPPED ON TO THE FLOOR OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ROUND MISSUS KNIGHTLEY SMILED SHE LOOKED TO ME LIKE AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN THAT HAD COME BY CHANCE INTO THE OTHER PLACE AND HADN'T FOUND OUT HER MISTAKE I SAW STARLIGHT START AS HE LOOKED AT HER
5126-27504-0044 HE WAS STILL LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AND THERE WAS A SOFT SORROWFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES LIKE I REMEMBER NOTICING ONCE BEFORE WHILE HE WAS TALKING TO AILEEN ABOUT HIS EARLY DAYS A THING HE NEVER DID BUT ONCE
5126-27504-0045 IT WAS PALE BUT CLEAR AND BRIGHT LOOKING AND THERE WAS A THIN STREAK OF BLOOD ACROSS HER FOREHEAD THAT SHOWED AS SHE CAME UNDERNEATH THE LAMP LIGHT FROM THE LANDING ABOVE I LOOKED OVER AT MORAN
5126-27504-0046 MISTER KNIGHTLEY WAS A MAN THAT ALWAYS HAD THE FIRST WORD IN EVERYTHING AND GENERALLY THE BEST OF AN ARGUMENT PUTTING DOWN ANYBODY WHO DIFFERED FROM HIM IN A QUIET SUPERIOR SORT OF WAY HE BEGAN NOW
5126-27504-0047 CAPTAIN STARLIGHT I SURRENDER MY SWORD OR SHOULD DO SO IF I HAD ONE
5126-27504-0048 I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE HONOUR SAYS STARLIGHT WALKING FORWARD AND BOWING LOW PERMIT ME TO OFFER YOU A CHAIR MADAM YOU LOOK FAINT AS HE DID SO SHE SANK DOWN IN IT AND REALLY LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD FAINT AWAY
5126-27504-0049 THEN MISTER KNIGHTLEY BEGAN AGAIN HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE STOOD HE DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF MORAN AND WALL THEY WERE A DEAL TOO QUIET FOR HIM AND HE COULD READ MEN'S FACES LIKE A BOOK
