5979-42000-0000 AND PERSUADED THAT NO PROOFS CAN BE PRODUCED AGAINST HIM IT IS A YET MORE ARDUOUS TASK TO MAKE A WOMAN SIMILARLY SITUATED SPEAK THE TRUTH AS THEY SAY AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE
5979-42000-0001 ONE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO MAKE THE DEVIL CONFESS
5979-42000-0002 WHO WAS AS SKILFUL IN MANAGING HIS QUESTIONS AS A TRIED GENERAL IN MANEUVERING HIS TROOPS
5979-42000-0003 WAS CONNIVING WITH THE MURDERER THE MOTIVE OF HER CONNIVANCE WAS YET UNKNOWN
5979-42000-0004 THAT THE OLD HAG KNEW EVERYTHING IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN REMARKED THE MAGISTRATE THAT SHE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO HER HOUSE WITH THE WOMEN THE VICTIMS THE MURDERER WITH ALL OF THEM IN FACT
5979-42000-0005 I READ IT IN HER EYES
5979-42000-0006 THE MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE WHO EVIDENTLY POSSESSES THE KEY TO THE ENIGMA THAT MAN MUST BE FOUND
5979-42000-0007 REMARKED LECOQ YES BUT SHE WON'T THE YOUNG DETECTIVE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDENTLY SUCH WAS HIS OWN OPINION HE DID NOT DELUDE HIMSELF WITH FALSE HOPES
5979-42000-0008 AND HE HAD NOTICED BETWEEN THE WIDOW CHUPIN'S EYEBROWS THOSE FURROWS WHICH ACCORDING TO PHYSIOGNOMISTS INDICATE A SENSELESS BRUTISH OBSTINACY WOMEN NEVER CONFESS RESUMED THE MAGISTRATE
5979-42000-0009 AND EVEN WHEN THEY SEEMINGLY RESIGN THEMSELVES TO SUCH A COURSE THEY ARE NOT SINCERE THEY FANCY THEY HAVE DISCOVERED SOME MEANS OF MISLEADING THEIR EXAMINER ON THE CONTRARY
5979-42000-0010 EVIDENCE WILL CRUSH THE MOST OBSTINATE MAN HE GIVES UP THE STRUGGLE AND CONFESSES NOW A WOMAN SCOFFS AT EVIDENCE SHOW HER THE SUN TELL HER IT'S DAYTIME AT ONCE SHE WILL CLOSE HER EYES AND SAY TO YOU
5979-42000-0011 NO IT'S NIGHT MALE PRISONERS PLAN AND COMBINE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF DEFENSE ACCORDING TO THEIR SOCIAL POSITIONS
5979-42000-0012 THE WOMEN ON THE CONTRARY HAVE BUT ONE SYSTEM NO MATTER WHAT MAY BE THEIR CONDITION IN LIFE THEY DENY EVERYTHING PERSIST IN THEIR DENIALS EVEN WHEN THE PROOF AGAINST THEM IS OVERWHELMING AND THEN THEY CRY
5979-42000-0013 WHEN I WORRY THE CHUPIN WITH DISAGREEABLE QUESTIONS AT HER NEXT EXAMINATION YOU MAY BE SURE SHE WILL TURN HER EYES INTO A FOUNTAIN OF TEARS
5979-42000-0014 HE HAD MANY WEAPONS IN HIS ARSENAL BUT NONE STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK A WOMAN'S DOGGED RESISTANCE IF I ONLY UNDERSTOOD THE MOTIVE THAT GUIDES THIS OLD HAG HE CONTINUED BUT NOT A CLUE
5979-42000-0015 WHO CAN TELL ME WHAT POWERFUL INTEREST INDUCES HER TO REMAIN SILENT
5979-42000-0016 YES THIS SUPPOSITION VERY NATURALLY PRESENTS ITSELF TO THE MIND
5979-42000-0017 IF THE WIDOW CHUPIN IS AN ACCOMPLICE THE MURDERER IS NOT THE PERSON WE HAVE SUPPOSED HIM TO BE HE IS SIMPLY THE MAN HE SEEMS TO BE
5979-42000-0018 WHAT IS YOUR OPINION HE ASKED THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HAD FORMED HIS OPINION A LONG WHILE AGO BUT HOW COULD HE A HUMBLE POLICE AGENT VENTURE TO EXPRESS ANY DECIDED VIEWS WHEN THE MAGISTRATE HESITATED
5979-42000-0019 HE UNDERSTOOD WELL ENOUGH THAT HIS POSITION NECESSITATED EXTREME RESERVE HENCE IT WAS IN THE MOST MODEST TONE THAT HE REPLIED MIGHT NOT THE PRETENDED DRUNKARD HAVE DAZZLED MOTHER CHUPIN'S EYES WITH THE PROSPECT OF A BRILLIANT REWARD
5979-42000-0020 MIGHT HE NOT HAVE PROMISED HER A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY
5979-42000-0021 THE SMILING CLERK HAD JUST RETURNED BEHIND HIM STOOD A PRIVATE OF THE GARDE DE PARIS WHO REMAINED RESPECTFULLY ON THE THRESHOLD HIS HEELS IN A STRAIGHT LINE HIS RIGHT HAND RAISED TO THE PEAK OF HIS SHAKO
5979-42000-0022 AND HIS ELBOW ON A LEVEL WITH HIS EYES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPOT SAID THE SOLDIER SENDS ME TO INQUIRE IF HE IS TO KEEP THE WIDOW CHUPIN IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT SHE COMPLAINS BITTERLY ABOUT IT
5979-42000-0023 CERTAINLY HE MURMURED AS IF REPLYING TO AN OBJECTION MADE BY HIS OWN CONSCIENCE CERTAINLY IT IS AN UNDOUBTED AGGRAVATION OF SUFFERING
5979-42000-0024 BUT IF I ALLOW THIS WOMAN TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE OTHER PRISONERS SHE WILL CERTAINLY FIND SOME OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PARTIES OUTSIDE
5979-42000-0025 THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AND TRUTH MUST BE CONSIDERED FIRST THE THOUGHT EMBODIED IN THESE LAST WORDS DECIDED HIM DESPITE HER COMPLAINTS THE PRISONER MUST BE KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS HE SAID
5979-42000-0026 THE SOLDIER ALLOWED HIS RIGHT HAND TO FALL TO HIS SIDE
5979-42000-0027 BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THE EXAMINATION OF THE PRISONER MAY
5979-42000-0028 THIS PRISONER HAS BEEN IN SUCH A STATE OF EXCITEMENT THAT WE HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO KEEP HIM IN A STRAIT WAISTCOAT HE DID NOT CLOSE HIS EYES ALL LAST NIGHT
5979-42000-0029 I HAVE RARELY SEEN A MORE DETERMINED CRIMINAL I THINK HIM CAPABLE OF ANY DESPERATE ACT
5979-42000-0030 IF I WERE IN YOUR PLACE SIR I WOULD ONLY LET HIM IN HERE WITH AN ESCORT OF SOLDIERS WHAT
5979-42000-0031 CAN IT BE THAT YOU'RE FRIGHTENED FRIGHTENED NO CERTAINLY NOT BUT NONSENSE INTERRUPTED LECOQ IN A TONE THAT BETRAYED SUPERLATIVE CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN MUSCLES AM I NOT HERE
5979-42000-0032 HE WOULD HAVE BLUSHED TO HAVE TAKEN THE SLIGHTEST MEASURE OF SELF PROTECTION ACCORDINGLY HE WENT AND SAT DOWN BY THE FIREPLACE
5979-42000-0033 AND THEN ORDERED HIS DOOR KEEPER TO ADMIT THE PRISONER ALONE HE EMPHASIZED THIS WORD ALONE A MOMENT LATER THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN WITH A VIOLENT JERK AND THE PRISONER ENTERED
5979-42000-0034 OR RATHER PRECIPITATED HIMSELF INTO THE ROOM
5979-42000-0035 TURNED PALE BEHIND HIS TABLE AND LECOQ ADVANCED A STEP FORWARD READY TO SPRING UPON THE PRISONER AND PINION HIM SHOULD IT BE REQUISITE BUT WHEN THE LATTER REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND LOOKED AROUND HIM
5979-42000-0036 WHERE IS THE MAGISTRATE HE INQUIRED IN A HOARSE VOICE
5979-42000-0037 NO THE OTHER ONE WHAT OTHER ONE THE ONE WHO CAME TO QUESTION ME LAST EVENING HE HAS MET WITH AN ACCIDENT YESTERDAY AFTER LEAVING YOU HE FELL DOWN AND BROKE HIS LEG OH
5979-42000-0038 AND I AM TO TAKE HIS PLACE THE PRISONER WAS APPARENTLY DEAF TO THE EXPLANATION EXCITEMENT HAD SEEMINGLY GIVEN WAY TO STUPOR HIS FEATURES HITHERTO CONTRACTED WITH ANGER NOW RELAXED
5979-42000-0039 HE GREW PALE AND TOTTERED AS IF ABOUT TO FALL COMPOSE YOURSELF SAID THE MAGISTRATE IN A BENEVOLENT TONE IF YOU ARE TOO WEAK TO REMAIN STANDING TAKE A SEAT
5979-42000-0040 THE MAN HAD RECOVERED HIS SELF POSSESSION A MOMENTARY GLEAM FLASHED FROM HIS EYES MANY THANKS FOR YOUR KINDNESS HE REPLIED BUT THIS IS NOTHING I FELT A SLIGHT SENSATION OF DIZZINESS BUT IT IS OVER NOW
5979-42000-0041 IS IT LONG SINCE YOU HAVE EATEN ANYTHING I HAVE EATEN NOTHING SINCE THAT MAN
5979-42000-0042 BROUGHT ME SOME BREAD AND WINE AT THE STATION HOUSE WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO TAKE SOMETHING
5979-42000-0043 AND YET IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND I SHOULD LIKE A GLASS OF WATER WILL YOU NOT HAVE SOME WINE WITH IT I SHOULD PREFER PURE WATER HIS REQUEST WAS AT ONCE COMPLIED WITH
5979-42000-0044 HE DRAINED A FIRST GLASSFUL AT A SINGLE DRAFT THE GLASS WAS THEN REPLENISHED AND HE DRANK AGAIN THIS TIME HOWEVER MORE SLOWLY ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS DRINKING IN LIFE ITSELF
