3033-138641-0000 WITH HER RAMBLE IN SEARCH OF MATILDA SAT SILENT IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
3033-138641-0001 TO EVERY CONCEIVABLE SURMISE ON THE CAUSE OF MISS JOHNSON'S DISAPPEARANCE THAT THE HUMAN MIND COULD FRAME TO WHICH ANNE RETURNED MONOSYLLABIC ANSWERS THE RESULT NOT OF INDIFFERENCE
3033-138641-0002 BUT OF INTENSE PREOCCUPATION PRESENTLY LOVEDAY THE FATHER CAME TO THE DOOR HER MOTHER VANISHED WITH HIM AND THEY REMAINED CLOSETED TOGETHER A LONG TIME
3033-138641-0003 AND SEATED HERSELF BENEATH THE BRANCHING TREE WHOSE BOUGHS HAD SHELTERED HER DURING SO MANY HOURS OF HER RESIDENCE HERE HER ATTENTION
3033-138641-0004 OF THE IRREGULAR BUILDING BEFORE HER THAN UPON THAT OCCUPIED BY HER MOTHER FOR SHE COULD NOT HELP EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO SEE SOME ONE RUN OUT WITH A WILD FACE
3033-138641-0005 GAZING AT HER OVER THE HEDGE WAS FESTUS DERRIMAN MOUNTED ON SUCH AN INCREDIBLY TALL ANIMAL THAT
3033-138641-0006 BUT AS HIS EYES WERE FIXED STEADILY UPON HER THIS WAS A FUTILE MANOEUVRE I SAW YOU LOOK ROUND HE EXCLAIMED CROSSLY
3033-138641-0007 AS SHE DID NOT TURN HE WENT ON
3033-138641-0008 YOU KNOW MY TEMPER WHAT I SAY I MEAN HE SEATED HIMSELF FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE PLUCKED SOME LEAVES FROM THE HEDGE AND BEGAN HUMMING A SONG
3033-138641-0009 TO SHOW HOW ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT HE WAS TO THE FLIGHT OF TIME WHAT HAVE YOU COME FOR THAT YOU ARE SO ANXIOUS TO SEE ME
3033-138641-0010 WHEN AT LAST HE HAD WEARIED HER PATIENCE RISING AND FACING HIM WITH THE ADDED INDEPENDENCE WHICH CAME FROM A SENSE OF THE HEDGE BETWEEN THEM THERE I
3033-138641-0011 KNEW YOU WOULD TURN ROUND HE SAID HIS HOT ANGRY FACE INVADED BY A SMILE IN WHICH HIS TEETH SHOWED LIKE WHITE HEMMED IN BY RED AT CHESS WHAT DO YOU WANT MISTER DERRIMAN
3033-138641-0012 SAID SHE WHAT DO YOU WANT MISTER DERRIMAN NOW LISTEN TO THAT IS THAT MY ENCOURAGEMENT
3033-138641-0013 O NOW HE SAW TRUMPET MAJOR LOVEDAY COURTING SOMEBODY LIKE YOU IN THAT GARDEN WALK AND WHEN HE CAME YOU RAN INDOORS
3033-138641-0014 UPON MY LIFE HE SAID SO HOW CAN YOU DO IT MISS GARLAND WHEN I WHO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY UP ALL THE LOVEDAYS WOULD GLADLY COME TO TERMS WITH YE WHAT
3033-138641-0015 MISGUIDED ROSEBUD THAT'S IT RUN OFF HE CONTINUED IN A RAISED VOICE
3033-138641-0016 BUT IT WON'T LAST LONG I SHALL MARRY YOU MADAM IF I CHOOSE AS YOU'LL SEE
3033-138641-0017 FROM THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS TONE DID NOT SEEM LIKE A PURE INVENTION IT SUDDENLY FLASHED UPON HER MIND THAT SHE HERSELF HAD HEARD VOICES IN THE GARDEN
3033-138641-0018 AND THAT THE PERSONS SEEN BY FARMER DERRIMAN OF WHOSE VISIT AND RECLAMATION OF HIS BOX THE MILLER HAD TOLD HER MIGHT HAVE BEEN MATILDA AND JOHN LOVEDAY
3033-138641-0019 SHE FURTHER RECALLED THE STRANGE AGITATION OF MISS JOHNSON ON THE PRECEDING EVENING AND THAT IT OCCURRED JUST AT THE ENTRY OF THE DRAGOON
3033-138641-0020 SUSPICION AMOUNTED TO CONVICTION THAT HE KNEW MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE SUPPOSED OF THAT LADY'S DISAPPEARANCE
3033-138641-0021 HE TURNED ASIDE TO THE GARDEN AND WALKED DOWN THAT PLEASANT ENCLOSURE TO LEARN IF HE WERE LIKELY TO FIND IN THE OTHER HALF OF IT THE WOMAN HE LOVED SO WELL YES THERE SHE WAS
3033-138641-0022 UNDER THE APPLE TREE BUT SHE WAS NOT FACING IN HIS DIRECTION HE WALKED WITH A NOISIER TREAD
3033-138641-0023 HE DID EVERYTHING IN SHORT BUT THE ONE THING THAT FESTUS DID IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES CALL OUT TO HER HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED ON THAT FOR THE WORLD ANY OF HIS SIGNS
3033-138641-0024 WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT HER
3033-138641-0025 NOW SHE WOULD NOT TURN AT LAST IN HIS FOND ANXIETY HE DID WHAT HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE WITHOUT AN INVITATION AND
3033-138641-0026 GOOD AFTERNOON TRUMPET MAJOR IN A GLACIAL MANNER UNUSUAL WITH HER WALKED AWAY TO ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN LOVEDAY
3033-138641-0027 HAD NOT THE STRENGTH OF MIND TO PERSEVERE FURTHER HE HAD A VAGUE APPREHENSION THAT SOME IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S UNHAPPY BUSINESS HAD REACHED HER AND UNABLE TO REMEDY THE EVIL
3033-138641-0028 THROUGH STICKING SO CLOSELY TO BUSINESS THAT DAY WELL JOHN BOB HAS TOLD YOU ALL OF COURSE A QUEER
3033-138641-0029 OR IT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED I HAVEN'T BEEN SO UPSET FOR YEARS NOR HAVE I
3033-138641-0030 TALKING TO HER FESTUS DERRIMAN RODE BY HALF AN HOUR AGO AND TALKED TO HER OVER THE HEDGE JOHN GUESSED THE REST AND
3033-138641-0031 OF THE EXCITEMENT THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO SET OUT BUT HE DID NOT PAUSE IN HIS WALK TILL HE HAD REACHED THE HEAD OF THE RIVER WHICH FED THE MILL STREAM HERE FOR SOME INDEFINITE REASON
3033-138641-0032 HE ALLOWED HIS EYES TO BE ATTRACTED BY THE BUBBLING SPRING WHOSE WATERS NEVER FAILED OR LESSENED AND HE STOPPED AS IF TO LOOK LONGER AT THE SCENE IT WAS REALLY BECAUSE
3033-138641-0033 BY DEGREES AS HE REFLECTED FIRST ON JOHN'S VIEW AND THEN ON HIS OWN
3033-138641-0034 AT LENGTH HE WAS SO BALANCED BETWEEN THE IMPULSE TO GO ON AND THE IMPULSE TO GO BACK THAT A PUFF OF WIND EITHER WAY WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL NIGH SUFFICIENT TO DECIDE FOR HIM
3033-138641-0035 WHEN HE ALLOWED JOHN'S STORY TO REPEAT ITSELF IN HIS EARS THE REASONABLENESS AND GOOD SENSE OF HIS ADVICE SEEMED BEYOND QUESTION WHEN ON THE OTHER HAND
3033-138641-0036 HE THOUGHT OF HIS POOR MATILDA'S EYES AND HER TO HIM PLEASANT WAYS THEIR CHARMING ARRANGEMENTS TO MARRY AND HER PROBABLE WILLINGNESS STILL
3033-138641-0037 HE COULD HARDLY BRING HIMSELF TO DO OTHERWISE THAN FOLLOW ON THE ROAD AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED THIS STRIFE OF THOUGHT WAS SO WELL MAINTAINED THAT SITTING AND STANDING
3033-138641-0038 HE REMAINED ON THE BORDERS OF THE SPRING TILL THE SHADOWS HAD STRETCHED OUT EASTWARDS AND THE CHANCE OF OVERTAKING MATILDA HAD GROWN CONSIDERABLY LESS STILL
3033-138641-0039 HE DID NOT POSITIVELY GO TOWARDS HOME AT LAST HE TOOK A GUINEA FROM HIS POCKET AND RESOLVED TO PUT THE QUESTION TO THE HAZARD HEADS I GO TAILS I DON'T
3033-138641-0040 THE PIECE OF GOLD SPUN IN THE AIR AND CAME DOWN HEADS NO I WON'T GO AFTER ALL HE SAID

3033-138641-0045 SUCH GOOD THINGS GET BLUE VINNIED FOR WANT OF A CEREMONY TO USE EM UPON AND AT LAST THEY HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS
3033-138641-0046 BITTERLY CRIED BOB IN A TONE OF FAR HIGHER THOUGHT HOW YOU DISAPPOINT ME AND HE WENT SLOWLY TOWARDS THE HOUSE HIS FATHER APPEARED IN THE OPENING OF THE MILL DOOR
