3588-186215-0000 CHAPTER TWO MOTHER AND DAUGHTER IN THE COSY CHAMBER OF AN APARTMENT LOCATED IN A FASHIONABLE QUARTER OF NEW YORK LOUISE MERRICK RECLINED UPON A COUCH DRESSED IN A DAINTY MORNING GOWN
3588-186215-0001 AND PROPPED AND SUPPORTED BY A DOZEN EMBROIDERED CUSHIONS
3588-186215-0002 STOOD A BOX OF BONBONS THE CONTENTS OF WHICH SHE OCCASIONALLY NIBBLED AS SHE TURNED THE PAGES OF HER NOVEL THE GIRL HAD A PLEASANT AND ATTRACTIVE FACE ALTHOUGH ITS LISTLESS EXPRESSION WAS SINGULAR IN ONE SO YOUNG
3588-186215-0003 THE ROOM WAS TASTEFULLY THOUGH SOMEWHAT ELABORATELY FURNISHED YET EVERYTHING IN IT SEEMED AS FRESH AND NEW AS IF IT HAD JUST COME FROM THE SHOP WHICH WAS NOT FAR FROM THE TRUTH THE APARTMENT ITSELF WAS NEW
3588-186215-0004 WITH HIGHLY POLISHED FLOORS AND WOODWORK AND DECORATIONS UNDIMMED BY TIME EVEN THE GIRL'S ROBE WHICH SHE WORE SO GRACEFULLY WAS NEW AND THE BOOKS UPON THE CENTER TABLE WERE OF THE LATEST EDITIONS
3588-186215-0005 THE PORTIERE WAS THRUST ASIDE AND AN ELDERLY LADY ENTERED THE ROOM SEATING HERSELF QUIETLY AT THE WINDOW AND AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE FORM UPON THE COUCH BEGINNING TO EMBROIDER PATIENTLY UPON SOME WORK
3588-186215-0006 SHE TOOK FROM A SILKEN BAG SHE MOVED SO NOISELESSLY THAT THE GIRL DID NOT HEAR HER AND FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ABSOLUTE SILENCE PERVADED THE ROOM THEN HOWEVER LOUISE IN TURNING A LEAF
3588-186215-0007 GLANCED UP AND SAW THE HEAD BENT OVER THE EMBROIDERY SHE LAID DOWN HER BOOK AND DREW AN OPEN LETTER FROM BETWEEN THE CUSHIONS BESIDE HER WHICH SHE LANGUIDLY TOSSED INTO THE OTHER'S LAP
3588-186215-0008 WHO IS THIS WOMAN MAMMA SHE ASKED MISSUS MERRICK GLANCED AT THE LETTER AND THEN READ IT CAREFULLY THROUGH BEFORE REPLYING JANE MERRICK IS YOUR FATHER'S SISTER
3588-186215-0009 THAT I CANNOT WELL EXPLAIN I HAD SUPPOSED YOU KNEW OF YOUR POOR FATHER'S SISTER JANE ALTHOUGH YOU WERE SO YOUNG WHEN HE DIED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE HE NEVER MENTIONED HER NAME IN YOUR PRESENCE THEY WERE NOT ON FRIENDLY TERMS YOU KNOW
3588-186215-0010 JANE WAS RICH HAVING INHERITED A FORTUNE AND A HANDSOME COUNTRY PLACE FROM A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY BUT WHO DIED ON THE EVE OF HIS WEDDING DAY HOW ROMANTIC EXCLAIMED LOUISE
3588-186215-0011 IT DOES SEEM ROMANTIC RELATED IN THIS WAY REPLIED HER MOTHER
3588-186215-0012 SHE BECAME A CRABBED DISAGREEABLE WOMAN OLD BEFORE HER TIME AND FRIENDLESS BECAUSE SHE SUSPECTED EVERYONE OF TRYING TO ROB HER OF HER MONEY YOUR POOR FATHER APPLIED TO HER IN VAIN FOR ASSISTANCE AND I BELIEVE HER REFUSAL POSITIVELY SHORTENED HIS LIFE
3588-186215-0013 WHEN HE DIED AFTER STRUGGLING BRAVELY TO SUCCEED IN HIS BUSINESS HE LEFT NOTHING BUT HIS LIFE INSURANCE THANK HEAVEN HE LEFT THAT SIGHED LOUISE YES WE WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGGARED INDEED
3588-186215-0014 WITHOUT IT AGREED MISSUS MERRICK YET I OFTEN WONDER LOUISE HOW WE MANAGED TO LIVE UPON THE INTEREST OF THAT MONEY FOR SO MANY YEARS WE DIDN'T LIVE WE EXISTED CORRECTED THE GIRL YAWNING
3588-186215-0015 MISSUS MERRICK FROWNED AND LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR I SOMETIMES DOUBT IF THE IDEA WAS SO BRILLIANT AFTER ALL SHE RETURNED WITH A CERTAIN GRIMNESS OF EXPRESSION WE'RE PLUNGING LOUISE
3588-186215-0016 AND IT MAY BE INTO A BOTTOMLESS PIT DON'T WORRY DEAR SAID THE GIRL BITING INTO A BONBON WE ARE ONLY ON THE VERGE OF OUR GREAT ADVENTURE AND THERE'S NO REASON TO BE DISCOURAGED YET I ASSURE YOU
3588-186215-0017 BRILLIANT OF COURSE THE IDEA WAS BRILLIANT MAMMA THE INCOME OF THAT INSURANCE MONEY WAS INSIGNIFICANT BUT THE CAPITAL IS A VERY RESPECTABLE SUM I AM JUST SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE
3588-186215-0018 ALTHOUGH I FEEL THAT I OUGHT TO BE THIRTY AT THE LEAST AND IN THREE YEARS I SHALL BE TWENTY AND A MARRIED WOMAN YOU DECIDED TO DIVIDE OUR CAPITAL INTO THREE EQUAL PARTS AND SPEND A THIRD OF IT EACH YEAR
3588-186215-0019 THIS PLAN ENABLING US TO LIVE IN GOOD STYLE AND TO ACQUIRE A CERTAIN SOCIAL STANDING THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO SELECT A WEALTHY HUSBAND IT'S A VERY BRILLIANT IDEA MY DEAR THREE YEARS IS A LONG TIME
3588-186215-0020 I'LL FIND MY CROESUS LONG BEFORE THAT NEVER FEAR YOU OUGHT TO RETURNED THE MOTHER THOUGHTFULLY BUT IF YOU FAIL WE SHALL BE ENTIRELY RUINED A STRONG INCENTIVE TO SUCCEED
3588-186215-0021 SAID LOUISE SMILING AN ORDINARY GIRL MIGHT NOT WIN OUT BUT I'VE HAD MY TASTE OF POVERTY AND I DON'T LIKE IT
3588-186215-0022 FOR AS LONG AS WE LIVE IN THIS LUXURIOUS FASHION WE SHALL PAY OUR BILLS PROMPTLY AND BE PROPER AND RESPECTABLE IN EVERY WAY THE ONLY CHANCE WE RUN LIES IN THE DANGER THAT ELIGIBLE YOUNG MEN MAY PROVE SHY AND REFUSE TO TAKE OUR BAIT
3588-186215-0023 BUT ARE WE NOT DIPLOMATS MOTHER DEAR
3588-186215-0024 BUT WILL BE CONTENT WITH A MAN WHO CAN SUPPORT US IN GOOD STYLE OR EVEN IN COMFORT AND IN RETURN FOR HIS MONEY I'LL BE A VERY GOOD WIFE TO HIM THAT SEEMS SENSIBLE AND WISE I'M SURE AND NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT OF ACCOMPLISHMENT
3588-186215-0025 MISSUS MERRICK STARED SILENTLY OUT OF THE WINDOW AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS SEEMED LOST IN THOUGHT I THINK LOUISE SHE SAID AT LAST YOU WILL DO WELL TO CULTIVATE YOUR RICH AUNT
3588-186215-0026 YOU MEAN THAT I SHOULD ACCEPT HER QUEER INVITATION TO VISIT HER YES SHE HAS SENT ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS ISN'T IT FUNNY
3588-186215-0027 JANE WAS ALWAYS A WHIMSICAL WOMAN PERHAPS SHE THINKS WE ARE QUITE DESTITUTE AND FEARS YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PRESENT A RESPECTABLE APPEARANCE AT ELMHURST WITHOUT THIS ASSISTANCE BUT IT IS AN EVIDENCE OF HER GOOD INTENTIONS
3588-186215-0028 FINDING DEATH NEAR AT HAND SHE IS OBLIGED TO SELECT AN HEIR AND SO INVITES YOU TO VISIT HER THAT SHE MAY STUDY YOUR CHARACTER AND DETERMINE WHETHER YOU ARE WORTHY TO INHERIT HER FORTUNE THE GIRL LAUGHED LIGHTLY
3588-186215-0029 IT WILL BE EASY TO CAJOLE THE OLD LADY SHE SAID IN TWO DAYS I CAN SO WIN HER HEART THAT SHE WILL REGRET SHE HAS NEGLECTED ME SO LONG EXACTLY
3588-186215-0030 IF I GET HER MONEY WE WILL CHANGE OUR PLANS AND ABANDON THE ADVENTURE WE WERE FORCED TO UNDERTAKE BUT IF FOR ANY REASON

3588-186215-0032 MISSUS MERRICK DID NOT REPLY SHE STITCHED AWAY IN A METHODICAL MANNER AS IF ABSTRACTED AND LOUISE CROSSED HER DELICATE HANDS BEHIND HER HEAD AND GAZED AT HER MOTHER REFLECTIVELY PRESENTLY SHE SAID
3588-186215-0033 IS THIS RICH AUNT OF MINE THE ONLY RELATIVE HE HAD NO INDEED THERE WERE TWO OTHER SISTERS AND A BROTHER A VERY UNINTERESTING LOT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF YOUR POOR FATHER THE ELDEST WAS JOHN MERRICK
3588-186215-0034 A COMMON TINSMITH IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY WHO WENT INTO THE FAR WEST MANY YEARS AGO AND PROBABLY DIED THERE FOR HE WAS NEVER HEARD FROM THEN CAME JANE WHO IN HER YOUNG DAYS HAD SOME SLIGHT CLAIM TO BEAUTY
3588-186215-0035 ANYWAY SHE WON THE HEART OF THOMAS BRADLEY THE WEALTHY YOUNG MAN I REFERRED TO AND SHE MUST HAVE BEEN CLEVER TO HAVE INDUCED HIM TO LEAVE HER HIS MONEY YOUR FATHER WAS A YEAR OR SO YOUNGER THAN JANE AND AFTER HIM CAME JULIA
