4280-185518-0000 IN MY SKETCH OF JOSEPH BALSAMO ALIAS THE COUNT ALESSANDRO DE CAGLIOSTRO I REFERRED TO THE AFFAIR OF THE DIAMOND NECKLACE KNOWN IN FRENCH HISTORY
4280-185518-0001 AS THE COLLIER DE LA REINE OR QUEEN'S NECKLACE FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH THE NAME AND REPUTATION OF MARIE ANTOINETTE
4280-185518-0002 BECAME ENTANGLED IN IT I SHALL NOW GIVE A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THIS CELEBRATED IMPOSITION PERHAPS THE BOLDEST AND SHREWDEST EVER KNOWN
4280-185518-0003 ON THE QUAI DE LA FERRAILLE NOT FAR FROM THE PONT NEUF STOOD THE ESTABLISHMENT PART SHOP PART MANUFACTORY OF MESSRS BOEHMER AND BASSANGE
4280-185518-0004 THE MOST CELEBRATED JEWELERS OF THEIR DAY AFTER TRIUMPHS WHICH HAD GIVEN THEM WORLD WIDE FAME
4280-185518-0005 AND MADE THEM FABULOUSLY RICH THEY DETERMINED
4280-185518-0006 AND CROWN THE PROFESSIONAL GLORY OF THEIR LIVES THEIR CORRESPONDENTS IN EVERY CHIEF JEWEL MARKET OF THE WORLD WERE SUMMONED TO AID THEIR ENTERPRISE AND IN THE COURSE OF SOME TWO OR THREE YEARS
4280-185518-0007 THEY SUCCEEDED IN COLLECTING THE FINEST AND MOST REMARKABLE DIAMONDS THAT COULD BE PROCURED IN THE WHOLE WORLD OF COMMERCE THE NEXT IDEA WAS TO COMBINE ALL THESE SUPERB FRAGMENTS IN ONE GRAND ORNAMENT
4280-185518-0008 TO GRACE THE FORM OF BEAUTY A NECKLACE WAS THE ARTICLE FIXED UPON
4280-185518-0009 WERE EXPENDED ON THE DESIGN EACH AND EVERY DIAMOND WAS SPECIALLY SET
4280-185518-0010 AND ALL WERE ARRANGED TOGETHER IN THE STYLE BEST CALCULATED TO HARMONIZE THEIR UNITED EFFECT FORM SHAPE
4280-185518-0011 AND THE RESULT
4280-185518-0012 AND THE ANXIOUS LABOR OF MANY MONTHS WAS THE MOST EXQUISITE TRIUMPH THAT THE GENIUS OF THE LAPIDARY AND THE GOLDSMITH COULD CONCEIVE
4280-185518-0013 THE WHOLE NECKLACE CONSISTED OF THREE TRIPLE ROWS OF DIAMONDS OR NINE ROWS IN ALL CONTAINING EIGHT HUNDRED FAULTLESS GEMS
4280-185518-0014 THE TRIPLE ROWS FELL AWAY FROM EACH IN THE MOST GRACEFUL AND FLEXIBLE CURVES OVER EACH SIDE OF THE BREAST AND EACH SHOULDER OF THE WEARER THE CURVES STARTING FROM THE THROAT
4280-185518-0015 WHENCE A MAGNIFICENT PENDANT DEPENDING FROM A SINGLE KNOT OF DIAMONDS EACH AS LARGE AS A HAZEL NUT HUNG DOWN HALF WAY UPON THE BOSOM IN THE DESIGN OF A CROSS AND CROWN
4280-185518-0016 SURROUNDED BY THE LILIES OF THE ROYAL HOUSE THE LILIES THEMSELVES DANGLING ON STEMS WHICH WERE STRUNG WITH SMALLER JEWELS RICH CLUSTERS AND FESTOONS SPREAD FROM THE LOOP
4280-185518-0017 OVER EACH SHOULDER AND THE CENTRAL LOOP ON THE BACK OF THE NECK WAS JOINED IN A PATTERN OF EMBLEMATIC MAGNIFICENCE CORRESPONDING WITH THAT IN FRONT IT WAS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO THAT THIS GRAND WORK WAS FINALLY COMPLETED
4280-185518-0018 AND THE HAPPY OWNERS GLOATED WITH DELIGHT OVER A MONUMENT OF SKILL AS MATCHLESS IN ITS WAY AS THE PYRAMIDS THEMSELVES BUT ALAS
4280-185518-0019 THE NECKLACE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED OF THE COMMON BOULDERS PILED IN THOSE SAME PYRAMIDS AS OF THE FINEST JEWELS OF THE MINE FOR ALL THE GOOD IT SEEMED DESTINED TO BRING THE POOR JEWELERS BEYOND THE RAPTURE OF BEHOLDING IT
4280-185518-0020 THE NECKLACE WAS WORTH ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS EQUIVALENT
4280-185518-0021 RATHER TOO LARGE A SUM TO KEEP LOCKED UP IN A CASKET THE READER WILL CONFESS
4280-185518-0022 HAD NOT ENTIRELY PAID FOR IT YET THEY HAD TEN CREDITORS ON THE DIAMONDS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND AN IMMENSE CAPITAL STILL LOCKED UP IN THEIR OTHER JEWELRY OF COURSE THEN AFTER THEIR FIRST DELIGHT HAD SUBSIDED
4280-185518-0023 THEY WERE MOST ANXIOUS TO SELL AN ARTICLE THAT HAD TO BE CONSTANTLY AND PAINFULLY WATCHED AND THAT MIGHT SO EASILY DISAPPEAR
4280-185518-0024 HOW MANY A NIMBLE FINGERED AND STOUT HEARTED ROGUE WOULD NOT IN THOSE DAYS HAVE IMPERILED A DOZEN LIVES TO CLUTCH THAT BLAZING HANDFUL OF DROSS CONVERTIBLE INTO AN ELYSIUM OF POMP AND PLEASURE
4280-185518-0025 IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN A SAFE NOONDAY PLAYTHING IN MORAL GOTHAM LET ALONE THE DISSOLUTE PARIS OF EIGHTY YEARS AGO THE FIRST THOUGHT OF COURSE
4280-185518-0026 WAS THAT THE ONLY PROPER RESTING PLACE FOR THEIR MATCHLESS BAUBLE WAS THE SNOWY NECK OF THE QUEEN MARIE ANTOINETTE THEN THE ADMIRED AND BELOVED OF ALL
4280-185518-0027 HER PEERLESS BEAUTY ALONE COULD LIVE IN THE GLOW OF SUCH SUPERNAL SPLENDOR AND THE FRENCH THRONE WAS THE ONLY ONE IN CHRISTENDOM THAT COULD SUSTAIN SUCH GLITTERING WEIGHT MOREOVER
4280-185518-0028 THE QUEEN HAD ALREADY ONCE BEEN A GOOD CUSTOMER TO THE COURT JEWELERS FOR IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SHE BOUGHT FOUR DIAMONDS OF THEM FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
4280-185518-0029 WOULD NOT HAVE HESITATED TO FLING IT ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE DU BARRY
4280-185518-0030 EASILY LISTENED TO THE DELICATE INSINUATIONS OF HIS COURT JEWELERS AND ONE FINE MORNING LAID THE NECKLACE IN ITS CASKET ON THE TABLE OF HIS QUEEN HER MAJESTY
4280-185518-0031 FOR A MOMENT YIELDED TO THE PROMPTINGS OF FEMININE WEAKNESS AND DANCED AND LAUGHED WITH THE GLEE OF AN OVERJOYED CHILD IN THE NEW SUNSHINE OF THOSE BURNING SPARKLING DAZZLING GEMS
4280-185518-0032 ONCE AND ONCE ONLY SHE PLACED IT ON HER NECK AND BREAST AND PROBABLY THE WORLD HAS NEVER BEFORE OR SINCE SEEN SUCH A COUNTENANCE IN SUCH A SETTING
4280-185518-0033 IT WAS ALMOST THE HEAD OF AN ANGEL SHINING IN THE GLORY OF THE SPHERES BUT A BETTER THOUGHT PREVAILED AND QUICKLY REMOVING IT SHE WITH A WAVE OF HER BEAUTIFUL HAND DECLINED THE GIFT
4280-185518-0034 AND BESOUGHT THE KING TO APPLY THE SUM TO ANY OTHER PURPOSE THAT WOULD BE USEFUL OR HONORABLE TO FRANCE WHOSE FINANCES WERE SADLY STRAITENED
4280-185518-0035 WE WANT SHIPS OF WAR MORE THAN WE DO NECKLACES SAID SHE THE KING WAS REALLY DELIGHTED AT THIS ACT OF THE QUEEN'S AND THE INCIDENT SOON BECOMING WIDELY KNOWN
4280-185518-0036 FOR AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER IT OCCURRED IN FACT
4280-185518-0037 CALLED THE SUFFREN AFTER THE GREAT ADMIRAL OF THAT NAME BOEHMER WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE BUSINESS MANAGER OF THE JEWELER FIRM FOUND HIS NECKLACE AS TROUBLESOME
4280-185518-0038 AS THE COBBLER DID THE ELEPHANT HE WON IN A RAFFLE AND TRIED SO PERSEVERINGLY TO INDUCE THE QUEEN TO BUY IT THAT HE BECAME A REAL TORMENT SHE SEEMS TO HAVE THOUGHT HIM A LITTLE CRACKED ON THE SUBJECT
4280-185518-0039 AND ONE DAY WHEN HE OBTAINED A PRIVATE AUDIENCE HE BESOUGHT HER EITHER TO BUY THE NECKLACE OR TO LET HIM GO AND DROWN HIMSELF IN THE SEINE OUT OF ALL PATIENCE
4280-185518-0040 THE QUEEN INTIMATED THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER TO SECURE A CUSTOMER TO BEGIN WITH THAT SHE WOULD NOT BUY THAT IF HE CHOSE TO THROW HIMSELF INTO THE SEINE IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY ON HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY
4280-185518-0041 AND THAT AS FOR THE NECKLACE HE HAD BETTER PICK IT TO PIECES AND SELL IT THE POOR GERMAN
4280-185518-0042 TIME PASSED ON MADAME CAMPAN ONE OF THE QUEEN'S CONFIDENTIAL LADIES HAPPENED TO MEET BOEHMER ONE DAY AND THE NECKLACE WAS ALLUDED TO WHAT IS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS ABOUT THE NECKLACE
4280-185518-0043 ASKED THE LADY HIGHLY SATISFACTORY REPLIED BOEHMER WHOSE SERENITY OF COUNTENANCE MADAME CAMPAN HAD ALREADY REMARKED I HAVE SOLD IT TO THE SULTAN AT CONSTANTINOPLE FOR HIS FAVORITE SULTANA
4280-185518-0044 THIS THE LADY THOUGHT RATHER CURIOUS BUT SHE WAS GLAD THE THING WAS DISPOSED OF AND SAID NO MORE TIME PASSED ON AGAIN IN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE BOEHMER TOOK THE TROUBLE
4280-185518-0045 TO CALL ON MADAME CAMPAN AT HER COUNTRY HOUSE SOMEWHAT TO HER SURPRISE HAS THE QUEEN GIVEN YOU NO MESSAGE FOR ME HE INQUIRED NO SAID THE LADY WHAT MESSAGE SHOULD SHE GIVE
4280-185518-0046 AN ANSWER TO MY NOTE SAID THE JEWELER MADAME REMEMBERED A NOTE WHICH THE QUEEN HAD RECEIVED FROM BOEHMER A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE ALONG WITH SOME ORNAMENTS SENT BY HIS HANDS TO HER AS A PRESENT FROM THE KING
4280-185518-0047 IT CONGRATULATED HER ON HAVING THE FINEST DIAMONDS IN EUROPE
4280-185518-0048 THE QUEEN COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT AND DESTROYED IT
4280-185518-0049 THE QUEEN BURNED THE NOTE SHE DOES NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEANT BY WRITING THAT NOTE THIS STATEMENT VERY QUICKLY ELICITED FROM THE NOW STARTLED GERMAN A STORY WHICH ASTOUNDED THE LADY HE SAID THE QUEEN OWED HIM
4280-185518-0050 THE FIRST INSTALMENT OF THE MONEY FOR THE DIAMOND NECKLACE THAT SHE HAD BOUGHT IT AFTER ALL THAT THE STORY ABOUT THE SULTANA
4280-185518-0051 AND DID NOT WISH THE PURCHASE KNOWN AND BOEHMER SAID SHE HAD EMPLOYED THE CARDINAL DE ROHAN TO BUY THE NECKLACE FOR HER
4280-185518-0052 FOR HER AND BY HIM TO HER NOW THE QUEEN AS MADAME CAMPAN KNEW VERY WELL HAD ALWAYS STRONGLY DISLIKED THIS CARDINAL HE HAD EVEN BEEN KEPT FROM ATTENDING AT COURT IN CONSEQUENCE
4280-185518-0053 AND SHE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS SPOKEN TO HIM FOR YEARS AND SO MADAME CAMPAN TOLD BOEHMER AND FURTHER SHE TOLD HIM HE HAD BEEN IMPOSED UPON NO SAID THE MAN OF SPARKLERS DECISIVELY IT IS YOU WHO ARE DECEIVED
4280-185518-0054 SHE IS DECIDEDLY FRIENDLY TO THE CARDINAL I HAVE MYSELF THE DOCUMENTS WITH HER OWN SIGNATURE AUTHORIZING THE TRANSACTION FOR I HAVE HAD TO LET THE BANKERS SEE THEM IN ORDER TO GET A LITTLE TIME ON MY OWN PAYMENTS
4280-185518-0055 HERE WAS A MONSTROUS MYSTIFICATION FOR THE LADY OF HONOR WHO TOLD BOEHMER TO INSTANTLY GO AND SEE HIS OFFICIAL SUPERIOR THE CHIEF OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD SHE HERSELF BEING VERY SOON AFTERWARDS SUMMONED TO THE QUEEN'S PRESENCE
4280-185518-0056 THE AFFAIR CAME UP AND SHE TOLD THE QUEEN ALL SHE KNEW ABOUT IT MARIE ANTOINETTE WAS PROFOUNDLY DISTRESSED BY THE EVIDENT EXISTENCE OF A GREAT SCANDAL AND SWINDLE
4280-185518-0057 WITH WHICH SHE WAS PLAINLY TO BE MIXED UP THROUGH THE FORGED SIGNATURES TO THE DOCUMENTS WHICH BOEHMER HAD BEEN RELYING ON NOW FOR THE CARDINAL LOUIS DE ROHAN
4280-185518-0058 WAS DESCENDED OF THE BLOOD ROYAL OF BRITTANY WAS A HANDSOME PROUD DISSOLUTE FOOLISH CREDULOUS UNPRINCIPLED NOBLE NOW ALMOST FIFTY YEARS OLD A THOROUGH RAKE OF LARGE REVENUES
4280-185518-0059 BUT DEEPLY IN DEBT HE WAS PEER OF FRANCE ARCHBISHOP OF STRASBURG GRAND ALMONER OF FRANCE COMMANDER OF THE ORDER OF THE HOLY GHOST
4280-185518-0060 SAID TO BE THE MOST WEALTHY IN EUROPE AND A CARDINAL HE HAD BEEN AMBASSADOR AT VIENNA A LITTLE AFTER MARIE ANTOINETTE WAS MARRIED TO THE DAUPHIN AND WHILE THERE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HIS OFFICIAL STATION TO DO A TREMENDOUS QUANTITY OF SMUGGLING
4280-185518-0061 HE HAD ALSO FURTHER AND MOST DEEPLY OFFENDED THE EMPRESS MARIA THERESA
4280-185518-0062 BY GROSS IRRELIGION AND ABOVE ALL BY A RATHER FLAT BUT IN EFFECT STINGINGLY SATIRICAL DESCRIPTION OF HER CONDUCT ABOUT THE PARTITION OF POLAND THIS SHE NEVER FORGAVE HIM
4280-185518-0063 NEITHER DID HER DAUGHTER MARIE ANTOINETTE AND ACCORDINGLY WHEN HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT PARIS SOON AFTER SHE BECAME QUEEN HE RECEIVED A CURT REPULSE AND AN INTIMATION
4280-185518-0064 THAT HE HAD BETTER GO TO STRASBURG NOW IN THOSE DAYS A SENTENCE OF EXCLUSION FROM COURT WAS TO A FRENCH NOBLE
4280-185518-0065 AND DE ROHAN WAS JUST SILLY ENOUGH TO FEEL THIS INFLICTION MOST INTENSELY HE WENT HOWEVER AND FROM THAT TIME ONWARD FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR LIVED THE LIFE
4280-185518-0066 OF A PERSEVERING ADAM THRUST OUT OF HIS PARADISE HANGING ABOUT THE GATE AND TRYING ALL POSSIBLE WAYS TO SNEAK IN AGAIN ONCE FOR INSTANCE
4280-185518-0067 TO LET HIM GET INSIDE THE GROUNDS DURING AN ILLUMINATION AND WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE GLOW OF HIS CARDINAL'S RED STOCKINGS FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK BUT HE WAS ONLY LAUGHED AT FOR HIS PAINS THE PORTER WAS TURNED OFF
4280-185518-0068 AND THE POOR SILLY MISERABLE CARDINAL REMAINED OUT IN THE COLD BREAKING HIS HEART OVER HIS EXCLUSION FROM THE MOST TEDIOUS MESS OF CONVENTIONALITIES THAT EVER WAS CONTRIVED EXCEPT THOSE OF THE COURT OF SPAIN
4280-185518-0069 ABOUT SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE THIS GREAT FOOL FELL IN WITH AN EQUALLY GREAT KNAVE
4280-185518-0070 WHERE HE BEGINS TO CONVERGE ALONG WITH THE REST TOWARDS THE EXPLOSION OF THE NECKLACE SWINDLE THIS WAS CAGLIOSTRO WHO AT THAT TIME CAME TO STRASBURG AND CREATED A TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT
4280-185518-0071 WITH HIS FASCINATING COUNTESS HIS EGYPTIAN MASONRY HIS SPAGIRIC FOOD A KIND OF BRANDRETH'S PILL OF THE PERIOD WHICH HE FED OUT TO POOR SICK PEOPLE HIS ELIXIR OF LIFE
4280-185518-0072 AND OTHER HUMBUGS THE CARDINAL SENT AN INTIMATION THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE QUACK THE QUACK WHOSE IMPUDENCE WAS FAR GREATER THAN THE CARDINAL'S PRIDE SENT BACK THIS SUBLIME REPLY IF HE IS SICK LET HIM COME TO ME
4280-185518-0073 AND I WILL CURE HIM IF HE IS WELL HE DOES NOT NEED TO SEE ME NOR I HIM THIS PIECE OF IMPUDENCE MADE THE FOOL OF A CARDINAL MORE EAGER THAN EVER AFTER SOME MORE AFFECTED SHYNESS
4280-185518-0074 CAGLIOSTRO ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE SEEN HE WAS JUST THE MAN TO CAPTIVATE THE CARDINAL AND THEY WERE QUICKLY INTIMATE PERSONAL FRIENDS PRACTISING TRANSMUTATION ALCHEMY MASONRY
4280-185518-0075 AND STILL MORE PARTICULARLY CONDUCTING A GREAT MANY EXPERIMENTS ON THE CARDINAL'S REMARKABLY FINE STOCK OF TOKAY WINE WHATEVER POOR DE ROHAN HAD TO DO HE CONSULTED CAGLIOSTRO ABOUT IT AND WHEN THE LATTER WENT TO SWITZERLAND
4280-185518-0076 LASTLY IS TO BE MENTIONED
4280-185518-0077 OF THE NECKLACE AFFAIR SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN REALLY A DESCENDANT OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF VALOIS
4280-185518-0078 CREATED COUNT DE SAINT REMI THE FAMILY HAD RUN DOWN AND BECOME POOR AND RASCALLY ONE OF JEANNE'S IMMEDIATE ANCESTORS HAVING PRACTICED COUNTERFEITING FOR A LIVING SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN PROTECTED
4280-185518-0079 HAD COME TO PARIS AND WAS LIVING IN POVERTY IN A GARRET HOVERING ABOUT AS IT WERE FOR A CHANCE TO BETTER HER CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS A QUICK WITTED BRIGHT EYED BRAZEN FACED HUSSY NOT BEAUTIFUL
4280-185518-0080 BUT WITH LIVELY PRETTY WAYS AND INDEED SOMEWHAT FASCINATING HER PROTECTRESS THE COUNTESS DE BOULAINVILLIERS WAS NOW DEAD WHILE SHE WAS ALIVE JEANNE HAD ONCE VISITED HER AT DE ROHAN'S PALACE OF SAVERNE
4280-185518-0081 AND HAD THUS SCRAPED A SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE GAY CARDINAL WHICH SHE RESUMED DURING HER ABODE AT PARIS EVERYBODY AT PARIS KNEW ABOUT THE DIAMOND NECKLACE AND ABOUT DE ROHAN'S DESIRE TO GET INTO COURT FAVOR
4280-185518-0082 JEWELLER CARDINAL QUEEN AND SWINDLER ALL TOGETHER INTO HER PLOT JUST AS THE KEY STONE DROPS INTO AN ARCH AND LOCKS IT UP TIGHT NO MORTAL KNOWS WHERE IDEAS COME FROM
4280-185518-0083 SUDDENLY A CONCEPTION IS IN THE MIND WHENCE OR HOW WE DO NOT KNOW ANY MORE THAN WE KNOW LIFE THE DEVIL HIMSELF MIGHT HAVE FURNISHED THAT WHICH NOW POPPED INTO THE CUNNING WICKED MIND OF THIS ADVENTURESS
4280-185518-0084 DE ROHAN IS CRAZY AFTER THE QUEEN'S FAVOR I AM CRAZY AFTER MONEY NOW IF I CAN MAKE DE ROHAN THINK THAT THE QUEEN WANTS THE NECKLACE AND WILL BECOME HIS FRIEND IN RETURN FOR HIS HELPING HER TO IT IF I CAN MAKE HIM THINK
4280-185518-0085 I AM HER AGENT TO HIM THEN I CAN STEAL THE DIAMONDS IN THEIR TRANSIT A WONDERFULLY CUNNING AND HARDY SCHEME AND MOST WONDERFUL WAS THE COOL KEEN PROMPTITUDE WITH WHICH IT WAS EXECUTED THE COUNTESS BEGAN TO HINT TO THE CARDINAL THAT SHE WAS FAST GETTING INTO THE QUEEN'S GOOD GRACES
4280-185518-0086 BY VIRTUE OF BEING A CAPITAL GOSSIP AND STORY TELLER AND THAT SHE HAD FREQUENT PRIVATE AUDIENCES SOON SHE ADDED INTIMATIONS THAT THE QUEEN WAS FAR FROM BEING REALLY SO DISPLEASED WITH THE CARDINAL
4280-185518-0087 AND SHOWED THE KEENEST EMOTIONS OF HOPE AND DELIGHT ON A FURTHER SUGGESTION HE PRESENTLY DREW UP A LETTER OR MEMOIR HUMBLY AND PLAINTIVELY STATING HIS CASE WHICH THE COUNTESS UNDERTOOK TO PUT INTO THE QUEEN'S HANDS
4280-185518-0088 IT WAS THE FIRST OF OVER TWO HUNDRED NOTES FROM HIM
4280-185518-0089 BESEECHING ARGUMENT EXPOSTULATION AND SO ON ALL ENTRUSTED TO JEANNE SHE BURNT THEM I SUPPOSE IN ORDER TO MAKE HER DUPE SURE THAT SHE TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT HER ACCESS TO THE QUEEN JEANNE MORE THAN ONCE MADE HIM GO AND WATCH HER ENTER A SIDE GATE
4280-185518-0090 INTO THE GROUNDS OF THE TRIANON PALACE TO WHICH SHE HAD SOMEHOW OBTAINED A KEY AND AFTER WAITING HE SAW HER COME OUT AGAIN SOMETIMES UNDER THE ESCORT OF A MAN WHO WAS SHE SAID
4280-185518-0091 THIS WAS VILLETTE DE RETAUX A PAL OF JEANNE'S AND OF HER HUSBAND LAMOTTE WHO HAD BY THE WAY BECOME A LOW CLASS GAMBLER
4280-185518-0092 TOLD HOW MUCH THE AMIABLE MARIE ANTOINETTE LONGED TO EXPEND CERTAIN SUMS FOR BENEVOLENT PURPOSES IF SHE ONLY HAD THEM BUT SHE WAS OUT OF FUNDS AND THE KING WAS SO CLOSE ABOUT MONEY THE POOR CARDINAL BIT AGAIN
4280-185518-0093 IF THE QUEEN WOULD ONLY ALLOW HIM THE HONOR TO FURNISH THE LITTLE AMOUNT THE COUNTESS EVIDENTLY HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT SHE REFLECTED HESITATED THE CARDINAL URGED SHE CONSENTED IT WAS NOT MUCH AND WAS SO KIND AS TO CARRY THE CASH HERSELF
4280-185518-0094 AT THEIR NEXT MEETING SHE REPORTED THAT THE QUEEN WAS DELIGHTED TELLING A VERY NICE STORY ABOUT IT THE CARDINAL WOULD ONLY BE TOO HAPPY TO DO SO AGAIN AND SURE ENOUGH HE DID AND QUITE A NUMBER OF TIMES TOO CONTRIBUTING IN ALL TO THE FUNDS
4280-185518-0095 OF THE COUNTESS IN THIS MANNER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WELL AFTER A TIME THE CARDINAL IS AT STRASBURG WHEN HE RECEIVES A NOTE FROM THE COUNTESS THAT BRINGS HIM BACK AGAIN AS QUICK AS POST HORSES CAN CARRY HIM
4280-185518-0096 IT SAYS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT VERY SECRET VERY DELICATE THAT THE QUEEN WANTS HIS HELP ABOUT HE IS OVERFLOWING WITH ZEAL WHAT IS IT ONLY LET HIM KNOW HIS LIFE HIS PURSE HIS SOUL
4280-185518-0097 ARE AT THE SERVICE OF HIS LIEGE LADY HIS PURSE IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED WITH INFINITE SHYNESS AND CIRCUMSPECTION THE COUNTESS GRADUALLY HALF UNWILLINGLY LETS HIM FIND OUT THAT IT IS THE DIAMOND NECKLACE
4280-185518-0098 THAT THE QUEEN WANTS BY DIABOLICAL INGENUITIES OF TALK SHE LEADS DE ROHAN TO THE FULL CONVICTION THAT IF HE SECURES THE QUEEN THAT NECKLACE HE WILL THENCEFORWARD BASK IN ALL THE SUNSHINE OF COURT FAVOR
4280-185518-0099 THAT SHE CAN SHOW OR CONTROL AND AT PROPER TIMES SUNDRY NOTES FROM THE QUEEN ARE BESTOWED UPON THE ENRAPTURED NOODLE THESE ARE WRITTEN IN IMITATION OF THE QUEEN'S HANDWRITING
4280-185518-0100 WHO PERSONATED THE QUEEN'S VALET AND WHO WAS AN EXPERT AT COUNTERFEITING
4280-185518-0101 DESIRES TO GRANT TO HER BELOVED SERVANT THE CARDINAL THIS SUGGESTION WAS RENDERED PRACTICABLE
4280-185518-0102 WHICH ARE FOUND THOUGH RARELY IN HISTORY AND WHICH ARE TOO IMPROBABLE TO PUT INTO A NOVEL THE CASUAL DISCOVERY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OF LOOSE CHARACTER WHO LOOKED MUCH LIKE THE QUEEN WHETHER HER NAME WAS
4280-185518-0103 AND WITH IMMENSE PRECAUTIONS THIS OSTRICH OF A CARDINAL WAS ONE NIGHT INTRODUCED INTO THE GARDENS OF THE TRIANON AND SHOWN A LITTLE NOOK AMONG THE THICKETS WHERE A STATELY FEMALE IN THE SIMILITUDE OF THE QUEEN RECEIVED HIM WITH SOFT SPOKEN WORDS
4280-185518-0104 OF KINDLY GREETING ALLOWED HIM TO KNEEL AND KISS A FAIR AND SHAPELY HAND AND SHOWED NO PARTICULAR TIMIDITY OF ANY KIND YET THE INTERVIEW HAD SCARCELY MORE THAN BEGUN BEFORE STEPS WERE HEARD SOME ONE IS COMING EXCLAIMED THE LADY
4280-185518-0105 IT IS MONSIEUR AND MADAME D'ARTOIS WE MUST PART THERE SHE GAVE HIM A RED ROSE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS FAREWELL AND AWAY THEY WENT MADEMOISELLE D'OLIVA TO REPORT TO HER EMPLOYERS AND THE CARDINAL
4280-185518-0106 IN A SEVENTH HEAVEN OF INEFFABLE TOMFOOLERY TO HIS HOTEL BUT THE INTERVIEW AND THE LOVELY LITTLE NOTES THAT CAME SOMETIMES FIXED THE NECKLACE BUSINESS AND IF FURTHER ENCOURAGEMENT HAD BEEN NEEDED CAGLIOSTRO GAVE IT
4280-185518-0107 ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE AFFAIR HAVING INDEED KEPT HIM FULLY INFORMED ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME AS HE DID OF ALL MATTERS OF INTEREST SO THE QUACK SET UP HIS TABERNACLES OF MUMMERY IN A PARLOR OF THE CARDINAL'S HOTEL
4280-185518-0108 AND CONDUCTED AN EGYPTIAN INVOCATION THERE ALL NIGHT LONG IN SOLITUDE AND POMP AND IN THE MORNING HE DECREED IN SUBSTANCE GO AHEAD
4280-185518-0109 WERE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO BARGAIN WITH THE GREAT AND WEALTHY CHURCH AND STATE DIGNITARY A MEMORANDUM OF TERMS AND TIME OF PAYMENT WAS DRAWN UP AND WAS SUBMITTED TO THE QUEEN THAT IS
4280-185518-0110 SWINDLING JEANNE CARRIED IT OFF AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH AN ENTRY MADE BY VILLETTE DE RETAUX IN THE MARGIN THUS BON BON APPROUVE
4280-185518-0111 THAT IS GOOD GOOD I APPROVE MARIE ANTOINETTE DE FRANCE THE PAYMENT WAS TO BE BY INSTALMENTS AT SIX MONTHS AND QUARTERLY AFTERWARDS THE QUEEN TO FURNISH THE MONEY TO THE CARDINAL
4280-185518-0112 WHILE HE REMAINED OSTENSIBLY HOLDEN TO THE JEWELLERS SHE THUS KEEPING OUT OF SIGHT SO THE JEWELS WERE HANDED OVER TO THE CARDINAL DE ROHAN HE TOOK THEM ONE EVENING IN GREAT STATE TO THE LODGINGS OF THE COUNTESS WHERE WITH ALL IMAGINABLE FORMALITY
4280-185518-0113 THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND WHEN IT WAS OPEN A TALL VALET ENTERED WHO SAID SOLEMNLY ON THE PART OF THE QUEEN DE ROHAN KNEW IT WAS THE QUEEN'S CONFIDENTIAL VALET FOR HE SAW WITH HIS OWN EYES THAT IT WAS THE SAME MAN
4280-185518-0114 WHO HAD ESCORTED THE COUNTESS FROM THE SIDE GATE AT THE TRIANON AND SO IT WAS TO WIT VILLETTE DE RETAUX WHO CALMLY RECEIVING THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANC TREASURE MARCHED BUT AS SOLEMNLY AS HE HAD COME IN
4280-185518-0115 THE SWINDLE WAS CONSUMMATED BUT THERE IS NO WHISPER OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE SPOILS VILLETTE AND JEANNE'S HUSBAND LAMOTTE WENT TO LONDON AND AMSTERDAM AND HAD SOME MONEY THERE
4280-185518-0116 BUT SEEMINGLY NO MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS PILLAGES UPON THE CARDINAL MIGHT HAVE SUPPLIED NOR DID THE COUNTESS SUBSEQUENT EXPENDITURES SHOW THAT SHE HAD ANY OF THE PROCEEDS BUT THAT IS NOT THE LAST OF THE REST OF THE PARTIES TO THE AFFAIR BY ANY MEANS
4280-185518-0117 HAVING A LITTLE BILL TO MEET BESET MADAME CAMPAN ABOUT HIS LETTER AND THE MONEY THE QUEEN WAS TO PAY HIM THERE INTERVENED SIX MONTHS DURING THAT TIME COUNTESS JEANNE WAS SMOOTHING AS WELL AS SHE COULD WITH ENDLESS LIES AND CONTRIVANCES
4280-185518-0118 THE TROUBLES OF THE PERPLEXED CARDINAL WHO COULDN'T SEEM TO SEE THAT HE WAS MUCH BETTER OFF IN SPITE OF HIS LOYAL PERFORMANCE OF HIS PART OF THE BARGAIN BUT THIS APPLICATION BY BOEHMER
4280-185518-0119 HAD BEEN PERPETRATED ON SOMEBODY OR OTHER OF COURSE WAKED UP A COMMOTION AT ONCE THE BARON DE BRETEUIL A DEADLY ENEMY OF DE ROHAN GOT HOLD OF IT ALL AND IN HIS OVERPOWERING EAGERNESS TO RUIN HIS FOE
4280-185518-0120 QUICKLY RENDERED THE MATTER SO PUBLIC THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO HUSH IT UP IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT JEANNE DE LAMOTTE EXPECTED THAT THE BUSINESS WOULD BE KEPT QUIET FOR THE SAKE OF THE QUEEN AND THAT THUS ANY VERY SEVERE OR PUBLIC PUNISHMENTS
4280-185518-0121 WOULD BE AVOIDED AND PERHAPS NO INQUIRIES MADE
4280-185518-0122 BUT DE BRETEUIL'S OFFICIOUSNESS PREVENTED IT AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT LEGAL MEASURES
4280-185518-0123 HAVING BARELY BEEN ABLE TO SEND A MESSAGE IN GERMAN TO HIS HOTEL TO A TRUSTY SECRETARY WHO INSTANTLY DESTROYED ALL THE PAPERS RELATING TO THE AFFAIR JEANNE WAS ALSO IMPRISONED
4280-185518-0124 BEING CAUGHT AT BRUSSELS AND AMSTERDAM WERE IN LIKE MANNER SECURED AS FOR CAGLIOSTRO HE WAS ALSO IMPRISONED SOME ACCOUNTS SAYING THAT HE OSTENTATIOUSLY
4280-185518-0125 GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR TRIAL THIS WAS A PUBLIC TRIAL BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT OF PARIS WITH MUCH FORM
4280-185518-0126 WAS ACQUITTED GAY D'OLIVA APPEARED TO HAVE KNOWN NOTHING EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS TO PLAY A PART AND SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THE QUEEN WANTED HER TO DO SO SO SHE WAS LET GO VILLETTE WAS BANISHED FOR LIFE LAMOTTE
4280-185518-0127 HAD ESCAPED TO ENGLAND AND WAS CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS IN HIS ABSENCE WHICH DIDN'T HURT HIM MUCH CAGLIOSTRO WAS ACQUITTED BUT JEANNE WAS SENTENCED TO BE WHIPPED BRANDED ON THE SHOULDER WITH THE LETTER V
4280-185518-0128 AND BANISHED THIS SENTENCE WAS EXECUTED IN FULL BUT WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY FOR THE WOMAN TURNED PERFECTLY FURIOUS ON THE PUBLIC SCAFFOLD FLEW AT THE HANGMAN LIKE A TIGER BIT PIECES OUT OF HIS HANDS SHRIEKED
4280-185518-0129 CURSED ROLLED ON THE FLOOR KICKED SQUIRMED AND JUMPED UNTIL THEY HELD HER BY BRUTE FORCE TORE DOWN HER DRESS AND THE RED HOT IRON GOING ASIDE AS SHE STRUGGLED
4280-185518-0130 PLUNGED FULL INTO HER SNOWY WHITE BREAST PLANTING THERE INDELIBLY THE HORRIBLE BLACK V WHILE SHE YELLED LIKE A FIEND UNDER THE TORMENT OF THE SMOKING BRAND SHE FLED AWAY TO ENGLAND
4280-185518-0131 LIVED THERE SOME TIME IN DISSOLUTE COURSES AND IS SAID TO HAVE DIED IN CONSEQUENCE OF FALLING OUT OF A WINDOW WHEN DRUNK OR AS ANOTHER ACCOUNT STATES
