5002-72876-0000 ON OUR ARRIVAL AT THE NUNNERY I WAS LEFT ALONE FOR HALF AN HOUR THEN THE BISHOP CAME IN WITH THE LADY SUPERIOR AND THE ABBESS WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE KITCHEN WHEN I LEFT THE BISHOP READ TO ME
5002-72876-0001 THREE PUNISHMENTS OF WHICH HE SAID I COULD TAKE MY CHOICE FIRST TO FAST FIVE DAYS IN THE FASTING ROOM SECOND TO SUFFER PUNISHMENT IN THE LIME ROOM THIRD TO FAST FOUR DAYS
5002-72876-0002 IN THE CELL AS I KNEW NOTHING OF THESE PLACES EXCEPT THE CELL A PRIEST WAS DIRECTED TO TAKE ME TO THEM THAT I MIGHT SEE FOR MYSELF AND THEN TAKE MY CHOICE AT FIRST
5002-72876-0003 I THOUGHT I DID NOT CARE AND I SAID I HAD NO CHOICE ABOUT IT BUT WHEN I CAME TO SEE THE ROOMS I WAS THANKFUL THAT I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ABIDE BY THAT DECISION CERTAINLY
5002-72876-0004 I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS BEFORE ME I WAS BLINDFOLDED AND TAKEN TO THE LIME ROOM FIRST I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN SITUATED AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE ROOM WE LEFT
5002-72876-0005 FOR HE LED ME DOWN SEVERAL FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AND THROUGH LONG LOW PASSAGES WHERE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAND ERECT AT LENGTH WE ENTERED A ROOM WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED LADEN
5002-72876-0006 WITH HOT VAPOR MY BLINDER WAS REMOVED AND I FOUND MYSELF IN A PLEASANT ROOM SOME FIFTEEN FEET SQUARE THERE WAS NO FURNITURE OF ANY KIND BUT A WIDE BENCH FASTENED TO THE WALL
5002-72876-0007 EXTENDED ROUND THREE SIDES OF THE ROOM THE FLOOR LOOKED LIKE ONE SOLID BLOCK OF DARK COLORED MARBLE NOT A CRACK OR SEAM TO BE SEEN IN IT BUT IT WAS CLOUDED
5002-72876-0008 HIGHLY POLISHED AND VERY BEAUTIFUL AROUND THE SIDES OF THE ROOM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOOKS AND CHAINS WERE FASTENED TO THE WALL AND A LARGE HOOK HUNG IN THE CENTER OVERHEAD
5002-72876-0009 NEAR THE DOOR STOOD TWO MEN WITH LONG IRON BARS SOME TWO INCHES SQUARE ON THEIR SHOULDERS THE PRIEST DIRECTED ME TO STAND UPON THE BENCH AND TURNING TO THE MEN
5002-72876-0010 THEY PUT DOWN THEIR BARS AND I SUPPOSE TOUCHED A CONCEALED SPRING FOR THE WHOLE FLOOR AT ONCE FLEW UP AND FASTENED TO THE LARGE HOOK OVER HEAD
5002-72876-0011 SURPRISED AND TERRIFIED I STOOD WONDERING WHAT WAS TO COME NEXT AT MY FEET YAWNED A DEEP PIT FROM WHICH AROSE A SUFFOCATING VAPOR SO HOT IT ALMOST SCORCHED MY FACE
5002-72876-0012 AND NEARLY STOPPED MY BREATH THE PRIEST POINTED TO THE HEAVING TUMBLING BILLOWS OF SMOKE THAT WERE ROLLING BELOW AND ASKED HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE THROWN INTO THE LIME
5002-72876-0013 NOT AT ALL I GASPED IN A VOICE SCARCELY AUDIBLE IT WOULD BURN ME TO DEATH I SUPPOSE HE THOUGHT I WAS SUFFICIENTLY FRIGHTENED
5002-72876-0014 THIS THEY DID BY SLOWLY LETTING DOWN THE FLOOR AND I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS IN SOME WAY SUPPORTED BY THE CHAINS ATTACHED TO THE WALLS
5002-72876-0015 I WAS NEARLY SUFFOCATED BY THE LIME SMOKE THAT FILLED THE ROOM AND THOUGH I KNEW NOT WHAT WAS IN RESERVE FOR ME I WAS GLAD WHEN MY BLINDER WAS PUT ON AND I WAS LED AWAY
5002-72876-0016 I THINK WE RETURNED THE SAME WAY WE CAME AND ENTERED ANOTHER ROOM WHERE THE SCENT WAS SO VERY OFFENSIVE THAT I BEGGED TO BE TAKEN OUT IMMEDIATELY EVEN BEFORE MY EYES WERE UNCOVERED
5002-72876-0017 AND I KNEW NOTHING OF THE LOATHSOME OBJECTS BY WHICH WE WERE SURROUNDED I FELT THAT I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BREATHE AN ATMOSPHERE SO DEADLY BUT THE SIGHT THAT MET MY EYES WHEN MY BLINDER WAS REMOVED
5002-72876-0018 I CANNOT DESCRIBE NOR THE SENSATIONS WITH WHICH I GAZED UPON IT I CAN ONLY GIVE THE READER SOME FAINT IDEA OF THE PLACE WHICH THEY SAID WAS CALLED THE FASTING ROOM AND HERE
5002-72876-0019 INCORRIGIBLE OFFENDERS FASTED UNTIL THEY STARVED TO DEATH NOR WAS THIS ALL THEIR DEAD BODIES WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED A DECENT BURIAL
5002-72876-0020 BUT WERE SUFFERED TO REMAIN IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY DIED UNTIL THE WORK OF DEATH WAS COMPLETE AND DUST RETURNED TO DUST THUS THE ATMOSPHERE BECAME A DEADLY POISON
5002-72876-0021 TO THE NEXT POOR VICTIM WHO WAS LEFT TO BREATHE THE NOXIOUS EFFLUVIA OF CORRUPTION AND DECAY I AM WELL AWARE THAT MY READER WILL HARDLY CREDIT MY STATEMENTS
5002-72876-0022 BUT I DO SOLEMNLY AFFIRM THAT I RELATE NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH IN THIS ROOM WERE PLACED SEVERAL LARGE IRON KETTLES SO DEEP THAT A PERSON COULD SIT IN THEM
5002-72876-0023 AND MANY OF THEM CONTAINED THE REMAINS OF HUMAN BEINGS IN ONE THE CORPSE LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN DEAD BUT A SHORT TIME OTHERS STILL SAT ERECT IN THE KETTLE
5002-72876-0024 BUT THE FLESH WAS DROPPING FROM THE BONES EVERY STAGE OF DECAY WAS HERE REPRESENTED FROM THE COMMENCEMENT TILL NOTHING BUT A PILE OF BONES WAS LEFT OF THE POOR SUFFERER CONCEIVE IF YOU CAN
5002-72876-0025 WITH WHAT FEELINGS I GAZED UPON THESE DISGUSTING RELICS OF THE DEAD EVEN NOW MY BLOOD CHILLS IN MY VEINS AS MEMORY RECALLS THE FEARFUL SIGHT OR AS IN SLEEP
5002-72876-0026 I LIVE OVER AGAIN THE DREAD REALITIES OF THAT HOUR WAS I TO MEET A FATE LIKE THIS I MIGHT PERCHANCE ESCAPE IT FOR THAT TIME BUT WHAT ASSURANCE HAD I
5002-72876-0027 THAT I WAS NOT ULTIMATELY DESTINED TO SUCH AN END THESE THOUGHTS FILLED MY MIND AS I FOLLOWED THE PRIEST FROM THE ROOM AND FOR A LONG TIME I CONTINUED TO SPECULATE UPON WHAT I HAD SEEN
5002-72876-0028 THEY CALLED IT THE FASTING ROOM BUT IF FASTING WERE THE ONLY OBJECT WHY WERE THEY PLACED IN THOSE KETTLES INSTEAD OF BEING ALLOWED TO SIT ON CHAIRS OR BENCHES
5002-72876-0029 OR EVEN ON THE FLOOR AND WHY PLACED IN IRON KETTLES WHY WERE THEY NOT MADE OF WOOD IT WOULD HAVE ANSWERED THE PURPOSE QUITE AS WELL
5002-72876-0030 IF FASTING OR STARVATION WERE THE ONLY OBJECTS IN VIEW THEN CAME THE FEARFUL SUGGESTION WERE THESE KETTLES EVER HEATED AND WAS THAT FLOOR MADE OF STONE OR IRON
5002-72876-0031 THE THOUGHT WAS TOO SHOCKING TO BE CHERISHED FOR A MOMENT BUT I COULD NOT DRIVE IT FROM MY MIND I WAS AGAIN BLINDFOLDED AND TAKEN TO A PLACE THEY CALLED A CELL
5002-72876-0032 BUT IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I WAS IN BEFORE WE DESCENDED SEVERAL STEPS AS WE ENTERED IT AND INSTEAD OF THE DARKNESS I ANTICIPATED I FOUND MYSELF IN A LARGE ROOM
5002-72876-0033 WITH SUFFICIENT LIGHT TO ENABLE ME TO SEE EVERY OBJECT DISTINCTLY ONE END OF A LONG CHAIN WAS FASTENED AROUND MY WAIST AND THE OTHER FIRMLY SECURED TO AN IRON RING IN THE FLOOR
5002-72876-0034 BUT THE CHAIN THOUGH LARGE AND HEAVY WAS LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO GO ALL OVER THE ROOM I COULD NOT SEE HOW IT WAS LIGHTED BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN SOME ARTIFICIAL MANNER
5002-72876-0035 FOR IT WAS QUITE AS LIGHT AT NIGHT AS IN THE DAY HERE WERE INSTRUMENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS THE USE OF WHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND SOME OF THEM LYING ON THE FLOOR
5002-72876-0036 OTHERS ATTACHED TO THE SIDES OF THE ROOM ONE OF THEM WAS MADE IN THE FORM OF A LARGE FISH BUT OF WHAT MATERIAL I DO NOT KNOW IT WAS OF A BRIGHT FLESH COLOR
5002-72876-0037 AND FASTENED TO A BOARD ON THE FLOOR IF I PRESSED MY FOOT UPON THE BOARD IT WOULD PUT IN MOTION SOME MACHINERY WITHIN WHICH CAUSED IT TO SPRING FORWARD WITH A HARSH JARRING SOUND
5002-72876-0038 LIKE THE RUMBLING OF THE CARS AT THE SAME TIME ITS EYES WOULD ROLL ROUND AND ITS MOUTH OPEN DISPLAYING A SET OF TEETH SO LARGE AND LONG
5002-72876-0039 THAT I WAS GLAD TO KEEP AT A SAFE DISTANCE I WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD REALLY BITE ME OR NOT BUT IT LOOKED SO FRIGHTFUL I DID NOT DARE TO HAZARD THE EXPERIMENT
5002-72876-0040 ANOTHER SO NEARLY RESEMBLED A LARGE SERPENT I ALMOST THOUGHT IT WAS ONE BUT I FOUND IT MOVED ONLY WHEN TOUCHED IN A CERTAIN MANNER THEN IT WOULD ROLL OVER OPEN ITS MOUTH
5002-72876-0041 AND RUN OUT ITS TONGUE THERE WAS ANOTHER THAT I CANNOT DESCRIBE FOR I NEVER SAW ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE IT IT WAS SOME KIND OF A MACHINE
5002-72876-0042 AND THE TURNING OF A CRANK MADE IT DRAW TOGETHER IN SUCH A WAY THAT IF A PERSON WERE ONCE WITHIN ITS EMBRACE THE PRESSURE WOULD SOON ARREST THE VITAL CURRENT AND STOP THE BREATH OF LIFE
5002-72876-0043 AROUND THE WALLS OF THE ROOM WERE CHAINS RINGS AND HOOKS ALMOST INNUMERABLE BUT I DID NOT KNOW THEIR USE AND FEARED TO TOUCH THEM
5002-72876-0044 I BELIEVED THEM ALL TO BE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE AND I THOUGHT THEY GAVE ME A LONG CHAIN IN THE HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT MY CURIOSITY WOULD LEAD ME INTO SOME OF THE NUMEROUS TRAPS
5002-72876-0045 THE ROOM CONTAINED EVERY MORNING THE FIGURE I HAD SEEN BESIDE THE DYING NUN WHICH THEY CALLED THE DEVIL CAME TO MY CELL AND UNLOCKING THE DOOR HIMSELF ENTERED
5002-72876-0046 AND WALKED AROUND ME LAUGHING HEARTILY AND SEEMING MUCH PLEASED TO FIND ME THERE HE WOULD BLOW WHITE FROTH FROM HIS MOUTH BUT HE NEVER SPOKE TO ME
5002-72876-0047 AND WHEN HE WENT OUT HE LOCKED THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND TOOK AWAY THE KEY HE WAS IN FACT VERY THOUGHTFUL AND PRUDENT BUT IT WILL BE LONG BEFORE I BELIEVE THAT HE CAME AS THEY PRETENDED
5002-72876-0048 FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD SO FAR FROM BEING FRIGHTENED THE INCIDENT WAS RATHER A SOURCE OF AMUSEMENT SUCH QUESTIONS AS THE FOLLOWING WOULD FORCE THEMSELVES UPON MY MIND
5002-72876-0049 WHERE DID HE GET THAT KEY AND WHAT WILL HE DO WITH IT DOES THE DEVIL HOLD THE KEYS OF THIS NUNNERY SO THAT HE CAN COME AND GO AS HE PLEASES
5002-72876-0050 OR ARE THE PRIESTS ON SUCH FRIENDLY TERMS WITH HIS SATANIC MAJESTY THAT THEY LEND HIM THEIR KEYS OR DO THEY HOLD THEM AS PARTNERS
