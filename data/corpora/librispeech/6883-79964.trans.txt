6883-79964-0000 THE KING SAID YOU CAN GO HOME NOW I HAVE NO FURTHER NEED FOR YOU I CAN ONLY PAY THOSE WHO SERVE ME THE SOLDIER DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR A LIVING AND HE WENT SADLY AWAY HE WALKED ALL DAY TILL HE REACHED A WOOD
6883-79964-0001 WHERE IN THE DISTANCE HE SAW A LIGHT ON APPROACHING IT HE FOUND A HOUSE INHABITED BY A WITCH PRAY GIVE ME SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT AND SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK HE SAID OR I SHALL PERISH OH HO SHE SAID
6883-79964-0002 WHO GIVES ANYTHING TO A RUNAWAY SOLDIER I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW BUT I WILL BE MERCIFUL AND TAKE YOU IN IF YOU WILL DO SOMETHING FOR ME WHAT IS IT ASKED THE SOLDIER I WANT YOU TO DIG UP MY GARDEN TO MORROW
6883-79964-0003 I SEE SAID THE WITCH THAT YOU CAN DO NO MORE THIS EVENING I WILL KEEP YOU ONE NIGHT MORE AND TO MORROW YOU SHALL SPLIT UP SOME LOGS FOR FIREWOOD THE SOLDIER TOOK THE WHOLE DAY OVER THIS TASK AND IN THE EVENING THE WITCH PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD AGAIN
6883-79964-0004 STAY ANOTHER NIGHT YOU SHALL ONLY HAVE A VERY LIGHT TASK TO MORROW SHE SAID THERE IS AN OLD DRY WELL BEHIND MY HOUSE MY LIGHT WHICH BURNS BLUE AND NEVER GOES OUT HAS FALLEN INTO IT AND I WANT YOU TO BRING IT BACK
6883-79964-0005 BUT WHEN HE WAS NEAR THE TOP THE WITCH PUT OUT HER HAND AND WANTED TO TAKE IT FROM HIM BUT HE SEEING HER EVIL DESIGNS SAID NO
6883-79964-0006 BOTH FEET SAFE ON DRY LAND AGAIN THE WITCH FLEW INTO A PASSION LET HIM FALL BACK INTO THE WELL AGAIN AND WENT AWAY
6883-79964-0007 AND THE BLUE LIGHT BURNT AS BRIGHTLY AS EVER BUT WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF THAT HE SAW THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE DEATH HE SAT FOR SOME TIME FEELING VERY SAD THEN
6883-79964-0008 THIS WILL BE MY LAST PLEASURE HE THOUGHT
6883-79964-0009 A TINY BLACK MAN APPEARED BEFORE HIM AND ASKED WHAT ORDERS MASTER
6883-79964-0010 THE SOLDIER ASKED IN AMAZEMENT I MUST DO ANYTHING THAT YOU COMMAND SAID THE LITTLE MAN
6883-79964-0011 THE LITTLE MAN TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND LED HIM THROUGH AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE BUT THE SOLDIER DID NOT FORGET TO TAKE THE BLUE LIGHT WITH HIM
6883-79964-0012 WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP HE SAID TO THE LITTLE MAN NOW GO BIND THE WITCH AND TAKE HER BEFORE THE JUDGE BEFORE LONG SHE CAME BY RIDING AT A FURIOUS PACE ON A TOM CAT AND SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HER VOICE
6883-79964-0013 THE LITTLE MAN SOON AFTER APPEARED AND SAID EVERYTHING IS DONE AS YOU COMMANDED AND THE WITCH HANGS ON THE GALLOWS WHAT FURTHER ORDERS HAVE YOU MASTER NOTHING AT THIS MOMENT ANSWERED THE SOLDIER YOU CAN GO HOME ONLY BE AT HAND WHEN I CALL YOU ONLY HAVE TO LIGHT YOUR PIPE AT THE BLUE LIGHT
6883-79964-0014 AND I WILL MAKE HER DO MENIAL SERVICE FOR ME IT IS AN EASY ENOUGH THING FOR ME TO DO SAID THE LITTLE MAN BUT IT WILL BE A BAD BUSINESS FOR YOU IF IT COMES OUT AS THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE THE DOOR SPRANG OPEN AND THE LITTLE MAN BORE THE MAIDEN IN
6883-79964-0015 AH HA THERE YOU ARE CRIED THE SOLDIER SET ABOUT YOUR WORK AT ONCE FETCH THE BROOM AND SWEEP THE FLOOR
6883-79964-0016 THEN HE THREW THEM AT HER AND MADE HER PICK THEM UP AND CLEAN THEM SHE DID EVERYTHING HE ORDERED WITHOUT RESISTANCE SILENTLY AND WITH HALF SHUT EYES AT THE FIRST COCK CROW THE LITTLE MAN CARRIED HER AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE
6883-79964-0017 AN EXTRAORDINARY DREAM I WAS CARRIED THROUGH THE STREETS AT LIGHTNING SPEED AND TAKEN TO THE ROOM OF A SOLDIER WHOM I HAD TO SERVE AS A MAID AND DO ALL KINDS OF MENIAL WORK
6883-79964-0018 CLEAN HIS BOOTS OF COURSE IT WAS ONLY A DREAM AND YET I AM AS TIRED THIS MORNING AS IF I HAD DONE IT ALL THE DREAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN TRUE SAID THE KING BUT I WILL GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE FILL YOUR POCKET WITH PEAS
6883-79964-0019 AND CUT A LITTLE HOLE IN IT THEN IF YOU ARE CARRIED AWAY AGAIN THEY WILL DROP OUT AND LEAVE A TRACK ON THE ROAD WHEN THE KING SAID THIS THE LITTLE MAN WAS STANDING BY INVISIBLE AND HEARD IT ALL AT NIGHT WHEN HE AGAIN CARRIED OFF THE PRINCESS
6883-79964-0020 THE PEAS CERTAINLY FELL OUT OF HER POCKET BUT THEY WERE USELESS TO TRACE HER BY FOR THE CUNNING LITTLE MAN HAD SCATTERED PEAS ALL OVER THE STREETS AGAIN THE PRINCESS HAD TO PERFORM HER MENIAL DUTIES TILL COCK CROW THE NEXT MORNING THE KING SENT OUT PEOPLE WHO WERE
6883-79964-0021 I SHALL BE SURE TO FIND IT THE LITTLE MAN HEARD THIS PLAN ALSO AND WHEN THE SOLDIER TOLD HIM TO BRING THE PRINCESS AGAIN HE ADVISED HIM TO PUT IT OFF HE SAID HE KNEW NO FURTHER MEANS AGAINST THEIR CRAFTINESS AND IF THE SHOE WERE FOUND
6883-79964-0022 IT WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS FOR HIS MASTER
6883-79964-0023 AND FOR THE THIRD TIME THE PRINCESS WAS BROUGHT AND MADE TO WORK LIKE A SERVANT BUT BEFORE LEAVING SHE HID ONE OF HER SHOES UNDER THE BED NEXT MORNING THE KING ORDERED THE WHOLE TOWN TO BE SEARCHED FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S SHOE AND IT WAS SOON FOUND IN THE SOLDIER'S ROOM
6883-79964-0024 HAD GONE OUTSIDE THE GATES BUT BEFORE LONG
6883-79964-0025 THE BLUE LIGHT AND HIS GOLD
6883-79964-0026 AND SUMMONED THE LITTLE MAN DON'T BE AFRAID HE SAID TO HIS MASTER GO WHERE THEY TAKE YOU AND LET WHAT WILL HAPPEN ONLY TAKE THE BLUE LIGHT WITH YOU NEXT DAY A TRIAL WAS HELD
6883-79964-0027 THE JUDGE SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH WHEN HE WAS LED OUT TO EXECUTION HE ASKED A LAST FAVOUR OF THE KING WHAT IS YOUR WISH ASKED THE KING THAT I MAY SMOKE A LAST PIPE
6883-79964-0028 BUT DON'T IMAGINE THAT I WILL THEREFORE GRANT YOU YOUR LIFE THEN THE SOLDIER DREW OUT HIS PIPE AND LIGHTED IT AT THE BLUE LIGHT AS SOON AS A FEW RINGS OF SMOKE AROSE THE LITTLE MAN APPEARED WITH A LITTLE CUDGEL IN HIS HAND AND SAID WHAT IS MY MASTER'S COMMAND
6883-79964-0029 AND DO NOT SPARE THE KING EITHER FOR ALL HIS CRUELTY TO ME THEN THE LITTLE MAN FLEW ABOUT LIKE LIGHTNING ZIG ZAG HITHER AND THITHER AND WHOMEVER HE TOUCHED WITH HIS CUDGEL FELL TO THE GROUND AND DARED NOT MOVE
6883-79964-0030 THE KING WAS NOW SEIZED WITH ALARM AND BEGGING ON HIS KNEES THAT HIS LIFE MIGHT BE SPARED HE RENDERED UP HIS KINGDOM
