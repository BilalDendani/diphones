5684-46240-0000 AND MUCH TOO LOW MENTAL POWERS TO APPRECIATE EACH OTHER'S BEAUTY OR OTHER ATTRACTIONS OR TO FEEL RIVALRY
5684-46240-0001 SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF THE KIND WHICH WE HAVE TO CONSIDER DO NOT OCCUR AND THIS FACT AGREES WITH THE BELIEF THAT SUCH CHARACTERS IN THE HIGHER CLASSES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION WHICH DEPENDS ON THE WILL DESIRE AND CHOICE OF EITHER SEX
5684-46240-0002 NEVERTHELESS SOME FEW APPARENT EXCEPTIONS OCCUR THUS AS I HEAR FROM DOCTOR BAIRD THE MALES OF CERTAIN ENTOZOA OR INTERNAL PARASITIC WORMS DIFFER SLIGHTLY IN COLOUR FROM THE FEMALES
5684-46240-0003 THE PERMANENTLY AFFIXED CONDITION OF OTHERS AND THE LOW MENTAL POWERS OF ALL THAT SUCH COLOURS DO NOT SERVE AS A SEXUAL ATTRACTION AND HAVE NOT BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION
5684-46240-0004 EXCEPT WHERE ONE SEX IS MUCH MORE BRILLIANTLY OR CONSPICUOUSLY COLOURED THAN THE OTHER AND WHERE THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN HABITS BETWEEN THE SEXES SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DIFFERENT COLOURS
5684-46240-0005 BUT THE EVIDENCE IS RENDERED AS COMPLETE AS IT CAN EVER BE ONLY WHEN THE MORE ORNAMENTED INDIVIDUALS ALMOST ALWAYS THE MALES VOLUNTARILY DISPLAY THEIR ATTRACTIONS BEFORE THE OTHER SEX FOR WE CANNOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH DISPLAY IS USELESS
5684-46240-0006 AND IF IT BE ADVANTAGEOUS SEXUAL SELECTION WILL ALMOST INEVITABLY FOLLOW WE MAY HOWEVER EXTEND THIS CONCLUSION TO BOTH SEXES WHEN COLOURED ALIKE
5684-46240-0007 BUT THAT WE MAY EASILY ERR ON THIS HEAD WILL BE ADMITTED
5684-46240-0008 INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY BENEFIT THUS DERIVED
5684-46240-0009 AND THOUGH IT ADDS TO THE BEAUTY OF THE MAIDEN'S CHEEK NO ONE WILL PRETEND THAT IT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED FOR THIS PURPOSE SO AGAIN WITH MANY ANIMALS ESPECIALLY THE LOWER ONES THE BILE IS RICHLY COLOURED THUS AS I AM INFORMED BY MISTER HANCOCK
5684-46240-0010 THIS BEAUTY BEING PROBABLY OF NO SERVICE TO THESE ANIMALS THE TINTS OF THE DECAYING LEAVES IN AN AMERICAN FOREST ARE DESCRIBED BY EVERY ONE AS GORGEOUS YET NO ONE SUPPOSES THAT THESE TINTS ARE OF THE LEAST ADVANTAGE TO THE TREES
5684-46240-0011 BEARING IN MIND HOW MANY SUBSTANCES CLOSELY ANALOGOUS TO NATURAL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN RECENTLY FORMED BY CHEMISTS
5684-46240-0012 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A STRANGE FACT IF SUBSTANCES SIMILARLY COLOURED HAD NOT OFTEN ORIGINATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY USEFUL END THUS GAINED IN THE COMPLEX LABORATORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS THE SUB KINGDOM OF THE MOLLUSCA
5684-46240-0013 THROUGHOUT THIS GREAT DIVISION OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM AS FAR AS I CAN DISCOVER SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS SUCH AS WE ARE HERE CONSIDERING NEVER OCCUR NOR COULD THEY BE EXPECTED IN THE THREE LOWEST CLASSES NAMELY IN THE ASCIDIANS POLYZOA AND BRACHIOPODS
5684-46240-0014 CONSTITUTING THE MOLLUSCOIDA OF SOME AUTHORS FOR MOST OF THESE ANIMALS ARE PERMANENTLY AFFIXED TO A SUPPORT OR HAVE THEIR SEXES UNITED IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL IN THE LAMELLIBRANCHIATA OR BIVALVE SHELLS HERMAPHRODITISM IS NOT RARE
5684-46240-0015 IN THE NEXT HIGHER CLASS OF THE GASTEROPODA OR UNIVALVE SHELLS THE SEXES ARE EITHER UNITED OR SEPARATE BUT IN THE LATTER CASE THE MALES NEVER POSSESS SPECIAL ORGANS FOR FINDING SECURING OR CHARMING THE FEMALES
5684-46240-0016 BUT AFTER AN ABSENCE OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT RETURNED AND APPARENTLY COMMUNICATED THE RESULT OF ITS SUCCESSFUL EXPLORATION FOR BOTH THEN STARTED ALONG THE SAME TRACK AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE WALL EVEN IN THE HIGHEST CLASS OF THE MOLLUSCA THE CEPHALOPODA OR CUTTLE FISHES
5684-46240-0017 IN WHICH THE SEXES ARE SEPARATE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF THE PRESENT KIND
5684-46240-0018 THAT IT WAS DESCRIBED BY CUVIER AS A PARASITIC WORM UNDER THE NAME OF HECTOCOTYLE BUT THIS MARVELLOUS STRUCTURE MAY BE CLASSED AS A PRIMARY RATHER THAN AS A SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTER ALTHOUGH WITH THE MOLLUSCA SEXUAL SELECTION DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE COME INTO PLAY
5684-46240-0019 THEY ARE PROBABLY THE DIRECT RESULT AS IN THE LOWEST CLASSES OF THE NATURE OF THE TISSUES
5684-46240-0020 DO NOT SEEK CONCEALMENT WHILST AGAIN SOME EQUALLY CONSPICUOUS SPECIES AS WELL AS OTHER DULL COLOURED KINDS LIVE UNDER STONES AND IN DARK RECESSES
5684-46240-0021 THESE NAKED SEA SLUGS ARE HERMAPHRODITES YET THEY PAIR TOGETHER AS DO LAND SNAILS MANY OF WHICH HAVE EXTREMELY PRETTY SHELLS
5684-46240-0022 MIGHT UNITE AND LEAVE OFFSPRING WHICH WOULD INHERIT THEIR PARENTS GREATER BEAUTY BUT WITH SUCH LOWLY ORGANISED CREATURES THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE NOR IS IT AT ALL OBVIOUS HOW THE OFFSPRING FROM THE MORE BEAUTIFUL PAIRS OF HERMAPHRODITES WOULD HAVE ANY ADVANTAGE OVER THE OFFSPRING OF THE LESS BEAUTIFUL
5684-46240-0023 SO AS TO INCREASE IN NUMBER UNLESS INDEED VIGOUR AND BEAUTY GENERALLY COINCIDED WE HAVE NOT HERE THE CASE OF A NUMBER OF MALES BECOMING MATURE BEFORE THE FEMALES WITH THE MORE BEAUTIFUL MALES SELECTED BY THE MORE VIGOROUS FEMALES
5684-46240-0024 IF INDEED BRILLIANT COLOURS WERE BENEFICIAL TO A HERMAPHRODITE ANIMAL IN RELATION TO ITS GENERAL HABITS OF LIFE THE MORE BRIGHTLY TINTED INDIVIDUALS WOULD SUCCEED BEST AND WOULD INCREASE IN NUMBER
5684-46240-0025 SUB KINGDOM OF THE VERMES CLASS ANNELIDA OR SEA WORMS
5684-46240-0026 SUB KINGDOM OF THE ARTHROPODA CLASS CRUSTACEA IN THIS GREAT CLASS WE FIRST MEET WITH UNDOUBTED SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OFTEN DEVELOPED IN A REMARKABLE MANNER UNFORTUNATELY THE HABITS OF CRUSTACEANS ARE VERY IMPERFECTLY KNOWN
5684-46240-0027 AND WE CANNOT EXPLAIN THE USES OF MANY STRUCTURES PECULIAR TO ONE SEX WITH THE LOWER PARASITIC SPECIES THE MALES ARE OF SMALL SIZE AND THEY ALONE ARE FURNISHED WITH PERFECT SWIMMING LEGS ANTENNAE AND SENSE ORGANS
5684-46240-0028 THE FEMALES BEING DESTITUTE OF THESE ORGANS WITH THEIR BODIES OFTEN CONSISTING OF A MERE DISTORTED MASS BUT THESE EXTRAORDINARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SEXES ARE NO DOUBT RELATED TO THEIR WIDELY DIFFERENT HABITS OF LIFE AND CONSEQUENTLY DO NOT CONCERN US
5684-46240-0029 IN VARIOUS CRUSTACEANS BELONGING TO DISTINCT FAMILIES THE ANTERIOR ANTENNAE ARE FURNISHED WITH PECULIAR THREAD LIKE BODIES
5684-46240-0030 AND THESE ARE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS IN THE MALES THAN IN THE FEMALES AS THE MALES WITHOUT ANY UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR OLFACTORY ORGANS
5684-46240-0031 THE INCREASED NUMBER OF THE SMELLING THREADS HAS PROBABLY BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION BY THE BETTER PROVIDED MALES HAVING BEEN THE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING PARTNERS AND IN PRODUCING OFFSPRING
5684-46240-0032 IN WHICH THE MALE IS REPRESENTED BY TWO DISTINCT FORMS
5684-46240-0033 THE RIGHT HAND ONE BEING AS I AM INFORMED BY MISTER BATE GENERALLY THOUGH NOT INVARIABLY THE LARGEST THIS INEQUALITY IS ALSO OFTEN MUCH GREATER IN THE MALE THAN IN THE FEMALE
5684-46240-0034 WHAT ADVANTAGE IS GAINED BY THEIR INEQUALITY IN SIZE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE BODY AND BY THE INEQUALITY BEING MUCH GREATER IN THE MALE THAN IN THE FEMALE AND WHY WHEN THEY ARE OF EQUAL SIZE BOTH ARE OFTEN MUCH LARGER IN THE MALE THAN IN THE FEMALE IS NOT KNOWN
5684-46240-0035 BUT IT IS PROBABLY THE CASE FOR WITH MOST ANIMALS WHEN THE MALE IS LARGER THAN THE FEMALE HE SEEMS TO OWE HIS GREATER SIZE TO HIS ANCESTORS HAVING FOUGHT WITH OTHER MALES DURING MANY GENERATIONS IN MOST OF THE ORDERS ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHEST OR THE BRACHYURA
5684-46240-0036 THE MALE IS LARGER THAN THE FEMALE THE PARASITIC GENERA HOWEVER IN WHICH THE SEXES FOLLOW DIFFERENT HABITS OF LIFE AND MOST OF THE ENTOMOSTRACA MUST BE EXCEPTED
5684-46240-0037 THUS WHEN A DEVIL CRAB PORTUNUS PUBER WAS SEEN BY A SON OF MISTER BATE FIGHTING WITH A CARCINUS MAENAS THE LATTER WAS SOON THROWN ON ITS BACK AND HAD EVERY LIMB TORN FROM ITS BODY WHEN SEVERAL MALES OF A BRAZILIAN GELASIMUS A SPECIES FURNISHED WITH IMMENSE PINCERS
5684-46240-0038 WERE PLACED TOGETHER IN A GLASS VESSEL BY FRITZ MUELLER THEY MUTILATED AND KILLED ONE ANOTHER
5684-46240-0039 BUT THE LATTER WAS SOON DISPOSSESSED MISTER BATE ADDS IF THEY FOUGHT THE VICTORY WAS A BLOODLESS ONE FOR I SAW NO WOUNDS THIS SAME NATURALIST SEPARATED A MALE SAND SKIPPER SO COMMON ON OUR SEA SHORES GAMMARUS MARINUS FROM ITS FEMALE
5684-46240-0040 BOTH OF WHOM WERE IMPRISONED IN THE SAME VESSEL WITH MANY INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME SPECIES THE FEMALE WHEN THUS DIVORCED SOON JOINED THE OTHERS AFTER A TIME THE MALE WAS PUT AGAIN INTO THE SAME VESSEL AND HE THEN AFTER SWIMMING ABOUT FOR A TIME DASHED INTO THE CROWD AND WITHOUT ANY FIGHTING
5684-46240-0041 AT ONCE TOOK AWAY HIS WIFE THIS FACT SHEWS THAT IN THE AMPHIPODA AN ORDER LOW IN THE SCALE THE MALES AND FEMALES RECOGNISE EACH OTHER AND ARE MUTUALLY ATTACHED THE MENTAL POWERS OF THE CRUSTACEA ARE PROBABLY HIGHER THAN AT FIRST SIGHT APPEARS PROBABLE
5684-46240-0042 ANY ONE WHO TRIES TO CATCH ONE OF THE SHORE CRABS SO COMMON ON TROPICAL COASTS WILL PERCEIVE HOW WARY AND ALERT THEY ARE THERE IS A LARGE CRAB BIRGUS LATRO FOUND ON CORAL ISLANDS WHICH MAKES A THICK BED OF THE PICKED FIBRES OF THE COCOA NUT AT THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP BURROW
5684-46240-0043 IT FEEDS ON THE FALLEN FRUIT OF THIS TREE BY TEARING OFF THE HUSK FIBRE BY FIBRE AND IT ALWAYS BEGINS AT THAT END WHERE THE THREE EYE LIKE DEPRESSIONS ARE SITUATED IT THEN BREAKS THROUGH ONE OF THESE EYES BY HAMMERING WITH ITS HEAVY FRONT PINCERS
5684-46240-0044 AND TURNING ROUND EXTRACTS THE ALBUMINOUS CORE WITH ITS NARROW POSTERIOR PINCERS BUT THESE ACTIONS ARE PROBABLY INSTINCTIVE
5684-46240-0045 AND EVIDENTLY THINKING THAT THEY MIGHT LIKEWISE ROLL IN CARRIED THEM TO THE SPOT WHERE IT HAD LAID THE FIRST IT WOULD I THINK BE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THIS ACT FROM ONE PERFORMED BY MAN BY THE AID OF REASON
5684-46240-0046 WITH THE ANTERIOR PART OF A RICH GREEN SHADING INTO DARK BROWN AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THESE COLOURS ARE LIABLE TO CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MINUTES THE WHITE BECOMING DIRTY GREY OR EVEN BLACK THE GREEN LOSING MUCH OF ITS BRILLIANCY
5684-46240-0047 IT DESERVES ESPECIAL NOTICE THAT THE MALES DO NOT ACQUIRE THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS UNTIL THEY BECOME MATURE THEY APPEAR TO BE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE FEMALES
5684-46240-0048 PROBABLY IN ALL THE SEXES PAIR AND INHABIT THE SAME BURROW THEY ARE ALSO AS WE HAVE SEEN HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ANIMALS FROM THESE VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THE MALE IN THIS SPECIES HAS BECOME GAILY ORNAMENTED IN ORDER TO ATTRACT OR EXCITE THE FEMALE
5684-46240-0049 IT HAS JUST BEEN STATED
5684-46240-0050 THIS SEEMS A GENERAL RULE IN THE WHOLE CLASS IN RESPECT TO THE MANY REMARKABLE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEXES WE SHALL HEREAFTER FIND THE SAME LAW PREVAILING THROUGHOUT THE GREAT SUB KINGDOM OF THE VERTEBRATA
5684-46240-0051 AND EXHIBIT MUCH INTELLIGENCE AS IS WELL KNOWN THE FEMALES OFTEN SHEW THE STRONGEST AFFECTION FOR THEIR EGGS WHICH THEY CARRY ABOUT ENVELOPED IN A SILKEN WEB THE MALES SEARCH EAGERLY FOR THE FEMALES AND HAVE BEEN SEEN BY CANESTRINI AND OTHERS TO FIGHT FOR POSSESSION OF THEM
5684-46240-0052 THIS SAME AUTHOR SAYS THAT THE UNION OF THE TWO SEXES HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN ABOUT TWENTY SPECIES AND HE ASSERTS POSITIVELY THAT THE FEMALE REJECTS SOME OF THE MALES WHO COURT HER THREATENS THEM WITH OPEN MANDIBLES AND AT LAST AFTER LONG HESITATION ACCEPTS THE CHOSEN ONE
5684-46240-0053 FROM THESE SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS WE MAY ADMIT WITH SOME CONFIDENCE THAT THE WELL MARKED DIFFERENCES IN COLOUR BETWEEN THE SEXES OF CERTAIN SPECIES ARE THE RESULTS OF SEXUAL SELECTION THOUGH WE HAVE NOT HERE THE BEST KIND OF EVIDENCE THE DISPLAY BY THE MALE OF HIS ORNAMENTS
5684-46240-0054 FOR INSTANCE OF THERIDION LINEATUM IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THESE SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF THE MALES HAVE NOT AS YET BECOME WELL FIXED CANESTRINI DRAWS THE SAME CONCLUSION FROM THE FACT THAT THE MALES OF CERTAIN SPECIES PRESENT TWO FORMS DIFFERING FROM EACH OTHER IN THE SIZE AND LENGTH OF THEIR JAWS
5684-46240-0055 IN GLOMERIS LIMBATA HOWEVER AND PERHAPS IN SOME FEW OTHER SPECIES THE MALES DIFFER SLIGHTLY IN COLOUR FROM THE FEMALES BUT THIS GLOMERIS IS A HIGHLY VARIABLE SPECIES
5684-46240-0056 IN THE MALES OF THE DIPLOPODA THE LEGS BELONGING EITHER TO ONE OF THE ANTERIOR OR OF THE POSTERIOR SEGMENTS OF THE BODY ARE MODIFIED INTO PREHENSILE HOOKS WHICH SERVE TO SECURE THE FEMALE
5684-46240-0057 IN SOME SPECIES OF IULUS THE TARSI OF THE MALE ARE FURNISHED WITH MEMBRANOUS SUCKERS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
