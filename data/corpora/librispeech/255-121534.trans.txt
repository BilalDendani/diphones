255-121534-0007 HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN WITH HIM BY ULYSSES WHEN HE SAILED FOR TROY HE HAD USED IT SO LONG AS HE HAD BEEN AT HOME BUT HAD LEFT IT BEHIND AS HAVING BEEN A KEEPSAKE FROM A VALUED FRIEND
255-121534-0008 ALONG WITH FRAGRANT HERBS REACHING THENCE SHE TOOK DOWN THE BOW WITH ITS BOW CASE FROM THE PEG ON WHICH IT HUNG SHE SAT DOWN WITH IT ON HER KNEES WEEPING BITTERLY AS SHE TOOK THE BOW OUT OF ITS CASE
255-121534-0009 AND WHEN HER TEARS HAD RELIEVED HER SHE WENT TO THE CLOISTER WHERE THE SUITORS WERE CARRYING THE BOW AND THE QUIVER WITH THE MANY DEADLY ARROWS THAT WERE INSIDE IT ALONG WITH HER CAME HER MAIDENS
255-121534-0010 BEARING A CHEST THAT CONTAINED MUCH IRON AND BRONZE WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD WON AS PRIZES WHEN SHE REACHED THE SUITORS SHE STOOD BY ONE OF THE BEARING POSTS SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER

255-121534-0012 AND SEND HIS ARROW THROUGH EACH ONE OF TWELVE AXES HIM WILL I FOLLOW AND QUIT THIS HOUSE OF MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SO GOODLY AND SO ABOUNDING IN WEALTH BUT EVEN SO I DOUBT NOT THAT I SHALL REMEMBER IT IN MY DREAMS
255-121534-0013 AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOLD EUMAEUS TO SET THE BOW AND THE PIECES OF IRON BEFORE THE SUITORS AND EUMAEUS WEPT AS HE TOOK THEM TO DO AS SHE HAD BIDDEN HIM HARD BY THE STOCKMAN WEPT ALSO
255-121534-0014 YOU COUNTRY LOUTS SAID HE SILLY SIMPLETONS WHY SHOULD YOU ADD TO THE SORROWS OF YOUR MISTRESS BY CRYING IN THIS WAY SHE HAS ENOUGH TO GRIEVE HER IN THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND SIT STILL THEREFORE
255-121534-0015 THERE IS NOT A MAN OF US ALL WHO IS SUCH ANOTHER AS ULYSSES FOR I HAVE SEEN HIM AND REMEMBER HIM THOUGH I WAS THEN ONLY A CHILD
255-121534-0016 BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON
255-121534-0017 HE WAS TO BE THE FIRST THAT SHOULD TASTE OF THE ARROWS FROM THE HANDS OF ULYSSES WHOM HE WAS DISHONOURING IN HIS OWN HOUSE
255-121534-0018 THEN TELEMACHUS SPOKE GREAT HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED JOVE MUST HAVE ROBBED ME OF MY SENSES HERE IS MY DEAR AND EXCELLENT MOTHER SAYING SHE WILL QUIT THIS HOUSE AND MARRY AGAIN
255-121534-0019 YET I AM LAUGHING AND ENJOYING MYSELF AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING HAPPENING BUT SUITORS AS THE CONTEST HAS BEEN AGREED UPON LET IT GO FORWARD IT IS FOR A WOMAN WHOSE PEER IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN PYLOS
255-121534-0020 BUT LET US SEE WHETHER YOU CAN STRING THE BOW OR NO I TOO WILL MAKE TRIAL OF IT FOR IF I CAN STRING IT AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON I SHALL NOT SUFFER MY MOTHER TO QUIT THIS HOUSE WITH A STRANGER
255-121534-0021 NOT IF I CAN WIN THE PRIZES WHICH MY FATHER WON BEFORE ME AS HE SPOKE HE SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT THREW HIS CRIMSON CLOAK FROM HIM
255-121534-0022 THIS DONE HE WENT ON TO THE PAVEMENT TO MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW THRICE DID HE TUG AT IT TRYING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO DRAW THE STRING AND THRICE HE HAD TO LEAVE OFF
255-121534-0023 THOUGH HE HAD HOPED TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON HE WAS TRYING FOR THE FOURTH TIME AND WOULD HAVE STRUNG IT HAD NOT ULYSSES MADE A SIGN TO CHECK HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EAGERNESS SO HE SAID ALAS
255-121534-0024 I SHALL EITHER BE ALWAYS FEEBLE AND OF NO PROWESS OR I AM TOO YOUNG AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED MY FULL STRENGTH SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HOLD MY OWN IF ANY ONE ATTACKS ME YOU OTHERS THEREFORE WHO ARE STRONGER THAN I
255-121534-0025 MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW AND GET THIS CONTEST SETTLED ON THIS HE PUT THE BOW DOWN LETTING IT LEAN AGAINST THE DOOR THAT LED INTO THE HOUSE WITH THE ARROW STANDING AGAINST THE TOP OF THE BOW
255-121534-0026 COME ON EACH OF YOU IN HIS TURN
255-121534-0027 LET ANOTHER HAVE IT THIS BOW SHALL TAKE THE LIFE AND SOUL OUT OF MANY A CHIEF AMONG US FOR IT IS BETTER TO DIE THAN TO LIVE AFTER HAVING MISSED THE PRIZE THAT WE HAVE SO LONG STRIVEN FOR AND WHICH HAS BROUGHT US SO LONG TOGETHER
255-121534-0028 SOME ONE OF US IS EVEN NOW HOPING AND PRAYING THAT HE MAY MARRY PENELOPE BUT WHEN HE HAS SEEN THIS BOW AND TRIED IT LET HIM WOO AND MAKE BRIDAL OFFERINGS TO SOME OTHER WOMAN AND LET PENELOPE
255-121534-0029 FROM WHAT THEY HAD IN THE HOUSE AND THE SUITORS WARMED THE BOW AND AGAIN MADE TRIAL OF IT BUT THEY WERE NONE OF THEM NEARLY STRONG ENOUGH TO STRING IT NEVERTHELESS
255-121534-0030 I THINK I WILL SAY IT WHAT MANNER OF MEN WOULD YOU BE TO STAND BY ULYSSES IF SOME GOD SHOULD BRING HIM BACK HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY WHICH YOU ARE DISPOSED TO DO TO SIDE WITH THE SUITORS
255-121534-0031 OR WITH ULYSSES FATHER JOVE ANSWERED THE STOCKMAN WOULD INDEED
255-121534-0032 IF SOME GOD WERE BUT TO BRING ULYSSES BACK YOU SHOULD SEE WITH WHAT MIGHT AND MAIN I WOULD FIGHT FOR HIM IN LIKE WORDS EUMAEUS PRAYED TO ALL THE GODS THAT ULYSSES MIGHT RETURN WHEN THEREFORE
255-121534-0033 HE SAW FOR CERTAIN WHAT MIND THEY WERE OF ULYSSES SAID IT IS I ULYSSES WHO AM HERE I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BUT AT LAST IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR I AM COME BACK TO MY OWN COUNTRY
255-121534-0034 IF HEAVEN SHALL DELIVER THE SUITORS INTO MY HANDS I WILL FIND WIVES FOR BOTH OF YOU WILL GIVE YOU HOUSE AND HOLDING CLOSE TO MY OWN AND YOU SHALL BE TO ME AS THOUGH YOU WERE BROTHERS AND FRIENDS OF TELEMACHUS
255-121534-0035 I WILL NOW GIVE YOU CONVINCING PROOFS THAT YOU MAY KNOW ME AND BE ASSURED SEE HERE IS THE SCAR FROM THE BOAR'S TOOTH THAT RIPPED ME WHEN I WAS OUT HUNTING ON MT PARNASSUS
255-121534-0036 AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS RAGS ASIDE FROM THE GREAT SCAR AND WHEN THEY HAD EXAMINED IT THOROUGHLY THEY BOTH OF THEM WEPT ABOUT ULYSSES THREW THEIR ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS
255-121534-0037 WHILE ULYSSES KISSED THEIR HANDS AND FACES IN RETURN THE SUN WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN UPON THEIR MOURNING IF ULYSSES HAD NOT CHECKED THEM AND SAID CEASE YOUR WEEPING LEST SOME ONE SHOULD COME OUTSIDE AND SEE US
255-121534-0038 AND TELL THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN WHEN YOU GO IN DO SO SEPARATELY NOT BOTH TOGETHER I WILL GO FIRST AND DO YOU FOLLOW AFTERWARDS LET THIS MOREOVER BE THE TOKEN BETWEEN US THE SUITORS
255-121534-0039 IF THEY HEAR ANY GROANING OR UPROAR AS OF MEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY MUST NOT COME OUT THEY MUST KEEP QUIET AND STAY WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR WORK AND I CHARGE YOU
255-121534-0040 AT THIS MOMENT THE BOW
255-121534-0041 WHO WAS WARMING IT BY THE FIRE BUT EVEN SO HE COULD NOT STRING IT AND HE WAS GREATLY GRIEVED HE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH AND SAID
255-121534-0042 I GRIEVE THAT I SHALL HAVE TO FORGO THE MARRIAGE BUT I DO NOT CARE NEARLY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS FOR THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WOMEN IN ITHACA AND ELSEWHERE WHAT I FEEL MOST IS THE FACT OF OUR BEING SO INFERIOR TO ULYSSES IN STRENGTH
255-121534-0043 THAT WE CANNOT STRING HIS BOW THIS WILL DISGRACE US IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO ARE YET UNBORN IT SHALL NOT BE SO EURYMACHUS SAID ANTINOUS AND YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF
255-121534-0044 THE REST APPROVED HIS WORDS AND THEREON MEN SERVANTS POURED WATER OVER THE HANDS OF THE GUESTS WHILE PAGES FILLED THE MIXING BOWLS WITH WINE AND WATER AND HANDED IT ROUND AFTER GIVING EVERY MAN HIS DRINK OFFERING
255-121534-0045 THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THEIR OFFERINGS AND HAD DRUNK EACH AS MUCH AS HE DESIRED ULYSSES CRAFTILY SAID SUITORS OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN LISTEN THAT I MAY SPEAK EVEN AS I AM MINDED
255-121534-0046 I APPEAL MORE ESPECIALLY TO EURYMACHUS AND TO ANTINOUS WHO HAS JUST SPOKEN WITH SO MUCH REASON CEASE SHOOTING FOR THE PRESENT AND LEAVE THE MATTER TO THE GODS BUT IN THE MORNING
255-121534-0047 FOR THEY FEARED HE MIGHT STRING THE BOW ANTINOUS THEREFORE REBUKED HIM FIERCELY SAYING WRETCHED CREATURE YOU HAVE NOT SO MUCH AS A GRAIN OF SENSE IN YOUR WHOLE BODY YOU OUGHT TO THINK YOURSELF LUCKY
255-121534-0048 IN BEING ALLOWED TO DINE UNHARMED AMONG YOUR BETTERS WITHOUT HAVING ANY SMALLER PORTION SERVED YOU THAN WE OTHERS HAVE HAD AND IN BEING ALLOWED TO HEAR OUR CONVERSATION
255-121534-0049 THE WINE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING YOU A MISCHIEF
255-121534-0050 THEN THEY DRAGGED HIM THROUGH THE DOORWAY OUT OF THE HOUSE SO HE WENT AWAY CRAZED AND BORE THE BURDEN OF HIS CRIME BEREFT OF UNDERSTANDING HENCEFORTH THEREFORE THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN MANKIND AND THE CENTAURS
255-121534-0051 BUT HE BROUGHT IT UPON HIMSELF THROUGH HIS OWN DRUNKENNESS IN LIKE MANNER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WILL GO HARDLY WITH YOU IF YOU STRING THE BOW YOU WILL FIND NO MERCY FROM ANY ONE HERE
255-121534-0052 WHO KILLS EVERY ONE THAT COMES NEAR HIM YOU WILL NEVER GET AWAY ALIVE SO DRINK AND KEEP QUIET WITHOUT GETTING INTO A QUARREL WITH MEN YOUNGER THAN YOURSELF PENELOPE THEN SPOKE TO HIM
255-121534-0053 ANTINOUS SAID SHE IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD ILL TREAT ANY GUEST OF TELEMACHUS WHO COMES TO THIS HOUSE IF THE STRANGER SHOULD PROVE STRONG ENOUGH TO STRING THE MIGHTY BOW OF ULYSSES
255-121534-0054 CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD TAKE ME HOME WITH HIM
255-121534-0055 THESE SUITORS ARE A FEEBLE FOLK THEY ARE PAYING COURT TO THE WIFE OF A BRAVE MAN WHOSE BOW NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO STRING AND YET A BEGGARLY TRAMP WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE STRUNG IT AT ONCE AND SENT AN ARROW THROUGH THE IRON
255-121534-0056 THIS IS WHAT WILL BE SAID AND IT WILL BE A SCANDAL AGAINST US EURYMACHUS PENELOPE ANSWERED PEOPLE WHO PERSIST IN EATING UP THE ESTATE OF A GREAT CHIEFTAIN
255-121534-0057 AND DISHONOURING HIS HOUSE MUST NOT EXPECT OTHERS TO THINK WELL OF THEM WHY THEN SHOULD YOU MIND IF MEN TALK AS YOU THINK THEY WILL THIS STRANGER IS STRONG AND WELL BUILT HE SAYS MOREOVER
255-121534-0058 THAT HE IS OF NOBLE BIRTH GIVE HIM THE BOW AND LET US SEE WHETHER HE CAN STRING IT OR NO I SAY AND IT SHALL SURELY BE THAT IF APOLLO
255-121534-0059 HIM THE GLORY OF STRINGING IT I WILL GIVE HIM A CLOAK AND SHIRT OF GOOD WEAR WITH A JAVELIN TO KEEP OFF DOGS AND ROBBERS AND A SHARP SWORD I WILL ALSO GIVE HIM SANDALS AND WILL SEE HIM SENT SAFELY WHEREVER HE WANTS TO GO
255-121534-0060 THAT ARE OVER AGAINST ELIS WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO LET ANY ONE HAVE THE BOW OR TO REFUSE IT NO ONE SHALL FORCE ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NOT EVEN THOUGH I CHOOSE TO MAKE THE STRANGER A PRESENT OF THE BOW OUTRIGHT AND LET HIM TAKE IT AWAY WITH HIM
255-121534-0061 GO THEN WITHIN THE HOUSE AND BUSY YOURSELF WITH YOUR DAILY DUTIES YOUR LOOM YOUR DISTAFF AND THE ORDERING OF YOUR SERVANTS THIS BOW IS A MAN'S MATTER AND MINE ABOVE ALL OTHERS FOR IT IS I WHO AM MASTER HERE
255-121534-0062 SHE WENT WONDERING BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND LAID HER SON'S SAYING IN HER HEART THEN GOING UPSTAIRS WITH HER HANDMAIDS INTO HER ROOM SHE MOURNED HER DEAR HUSBAND TILL MINERVA SENT SWEET SLEEP OVER HER EYELIDS
255-121534-0063 IF APOLLO AND THE OTHER GODS WILL GRANT OUR PRAYER YOUR OWN BOARHOUNDS SHALL GET YOU INTO SOME QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND WORRY YOU TO DEATH EUMAEUS WAS FRIGHTENED AT THE OUTCRY THEY ALL RAISED
255-121534-0064 SO HE PUT THE BOW DOWN THEN AND THERE BUT TELEMACHUS SHOUTED OUT AT HIM FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLOISTERS AND THREATENED HIM SAYING FATHER EUMAEUS BRING THE BOW ON IN SPITE OF THEM
255-121534-0065 OR YOUNG AS I AM I WILL PELT YOU WITH STONES BACK TO THE COUNTRY FOR I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO I WISH I WAS AS MUCH STRONGER THAN ALL THE OTHER SUITORS IN THE HOUSE AS I AM THAN YOU
255-121534-0066 SO EUMAEUS BROUGHT THE BOW ON AND PLACED IT IN THE HANDS OF ULYSSES WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS HE CALLED EURYCLEA APART AND SAID TO HER
255-121534-0067 TELEMACHUS SAYS YOU ARE TO CLOSE THE DOORS OF THE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IF THEY HEAR ANY GROANING OR UPROAR AS OF MEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY ARE NOT TO COME OUT BUT ARE TO KEEP QUIET AND STAY WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR WORK
255-121534-0068 THERE WAS A SHIP'S CABLE OF BYBLUS FIBRE LYING IN THE GATEHOUSE SO HE MADE THE GATES FAST WITH IT AND THEN CAME IN AGAIN RESUMING THE SEAT THAT HE HAD LEFT AND KEEPING AN EYE ON ULYSSES WHO HAD NOW GOT THE BOW IN HIS HANDS
255-121534-0069 AND WAS TURNING IT EVERY WAY ABOUT AND PROVING IT ALL OVER TO SEE WHETHER THE WORMS HAD BEEN EATING INTO ITS TWO HORNS DURING HIS ABSENCE THEN WOULD ONE TURN TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOUR SAYING
255-121534-0070 STRUNG IT AS EASILY AS A SKILLED BARD STRINGS A NEW PEG OF HIS LYRE AND MAKES THE TWISTED GUT FAST AT BOTH ENDS THEN HE TOOK IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND TO PROVE THE STRING AND IT SANG SWEETLY UNDER HIS TOUCH
255-121534-0071 LIKE THE TWITTERING OF A SWALLOW THE SUITORS WERE DISMAYED AND TURNED COLOUR AS THEY HEARD IT AT THAT MOMENT MOREOVER JOVE THUNDERED LOUDLY AS A SIGN AND THE HEART OF ULYSSES REJOICED AS HE HEARD THE OMEN
255-121534-0072 THAT THE SON OF SCHEMING SATURN HAD SENT HIM
255-121534-0073 WERE SO SHORTLY ABOUT TO TASTE WERE ALL INSIDE THE QUIVER HE LAID IT ON THE CENTRE PIECE OF THE BOW AND DREW THE NOTCH OF THE ARROW
255-121534-0074 WHEN HE HAD TAKEN AIM HE LET FLY AND HIS ARROW PIERCED EVERY ONE OF THE HANDLE HOLES OF THE AXES FROM THE FIRST ONWARDS TILL IT HAD GONE RIGHT THROUGH THEM AND INTO THE OUTER COURTYARD THEN HE SAID TO TELEMACHUS
255-121534-0075 YOUR GUEST HAS NOT DISGRACED YOU TELEMACHUS I DID NOT MISS WHAT I AIMED AT AND I WAS NOT LONG IN STRINGING MY BOW I AM STILL STRONG AND NOT AS THE SUITORS TWIT ME WITH BEING NOW HOWEVER
255-121534-0076 IT IS TIME FOR THE ACHAEANS TO PREPARE SUPPER WHILE THERE IS STILL DAYLIGHT AND THEN OTHERWISE TO DISPORT THEMSELVES WITH SONG AND DANCE WHICH ARE THE CROWNING ORNAMENTS OF A BANQUET
