7247-101864-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE THE GREAT DINING ROOM AT HILCREST THE OLD SPENCER HOMESTEAD WAS PERHAPS THE PLEASANTEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE THE HOUSE ITSELF CROWNED THE HIGHEST HILL THAT OVERLOOKED THE TOWN
7247-101864-0001 ONE MIGHT SEE THE TOWN WITH ITS MYRIAD ROOFS AND TALL CHIMNEYS BUT ALTHOUGH THESE SAME TALL CHIMNEYS REPRESENTED THE WEALTH THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE GREAT SPENCER ESTATE
7247-101864-0002 HAD PREFERRED THE SIDE THAT OVERLOOKED THE TOWN AND THAT HE SPENT LONG HOURS GLOATING OVER THE VISIBLE RESULTS OF HIS THRIFT AND ENTERPRISE BUT OLD JACOB WAS DEAD NOW AND HIS SON'S SONS REIGNED INSTEAD
7247-101864-0003 AND HIS SON'S SONS NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY MIGHT VALUE THE WHIZ AND WHIR AND SMOKE OF THE TOWN PREFERRED WHEN AT REST TO GAZE UPON GREEN HILLS AND FAR REACHING MEADOWS THIS WAS INDEED TYPICAL OF THE SPENCER CODE
7247-101864-0004 THE FARTHER AWAY THEY COULD GET FROM THE OIL THAT MADE THE MACHINERY OF LIFE RUN EASILY AND NOISELESSLY THE BETTER PLEASED THEY WERE THE DINING ROOM LOOKED PARTICULARLY PLEASANT THIS JULY EVENING A GENTLE BREEZE STIRRED THE CURTAINS AT THE OPEN WINDOWS
7247-101864-0005 AND THE SETTING SUN PEEPED THROUGH THE VINES OUTSIDE AND GLISTENED ON THE OLD FAMILY PLATE THREE GENERATIONS OF SPENCERS LOOKED DOWN FROM THE WALLS ON THE TWO MEN AND THE WOMAN SITTING AT THE GREAT MAHOGANY TABLE THE TWO MEN AND THE WOMAN HOWEVER
7247-101864-0006 WERE NOT LOOKING AT THE SUNLIGHT THE VINES OR THE SWAYING CURTAINS THEY WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND THEIR EYES WERE TROUBLED AND QUESTIONING YOU SAY SHE IS COMING NEXT WEEK ASKED THE YOUNGER MAN GLANCING AT THE LETTER IN THE OTHER'S HAND
7247-101864-0007 YES TUESDAY AFTERNOON BUT FRANK THIS IS SO SUDDEN REMONSTRATED THE YOUNG FELLOW LAUGHING A LITTLE AS HE UTTERED THE TRITE PHRASE
7247-101864-0008 HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT I'VE HEARD SO LITTLE OF THIS YOUNG LADY WHO IS TO BE SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY DROPPED INTO OUR MIDST NEXT TUESDAY FRANK SPENCER MADE AN IMPATIENT GESTURE THAT SHOWED HOW GREAT WAS HIS PERTURBATION
7247-101864-0009 COME COME NED DON'T BE FOOLISH HE PROTESTED YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT YOUR BROTHER'S STEPDAUGHTER HAS BEEN MY WARD FOR A DOZEN YEARS YES BUT THAT IS ALL I KNOW REJOINED THE YOUNG MAN QUIETLY I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER AND SCARCELY EVER HEARD OF HER
7247-101864-0010 AND YET YOU EXPECT ME TO TAKE AS A MATTER OF COURSE THIS STRANGE YOUNG WOMAN WHO IS NONE OF OUR KITH NOR KIN AND YET WHO IS TO BE ONE OF US FROM HENCEFORTH FOREVERMORE THE BOY IS RIGHT INTERPOSED THE LOW VOICE OF THE WOMAN ACROSS THE TABLE
7247-101864-0011 NED DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER HE WAS A MERE CHILD HIMSELF WHEN IT ALL HAPPENED AND HE'S BEEN AWAY FROM HOME MOST OF THE TIME SINCE FOR THAT MATTER WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HER OURSELVES WE CERTAINLY DON'T SIGHED FRANK SPENCER
7247-101864-0012 THEN HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND SQUARED HIS SHOULDERS SEE HERE GOOD PEOPLE THIS WILL NEVER DO IN THE WORLD HE ASSERTED WITH SUDDEN AUTHORITY I HAVE OFFERED THE HOSPITALITY OF THIS HOUSE TO A HOMELESS ORPHAN GIRL AND SHE HAS ACCEPTED IT
7247-101864-0013 THERE IS NOTHING FOR US TO DO NOW BUT TO TRY TO MAKE HER HAPPY AFTER ALL WE NEEDN'T WORRY IT MAY TURN OUT THAT SHE WILL MAKE US HAPPY BUT WHAT IS SHE HOW DOES SHE LOOK CATECHIZED NED HIS BROTHER SHOOK HIS HEAD I DON'T KNOW
7247-101864-0014 HE REPLIED SIMPLY YOU DON'T KNOW BUT SURELY YOU HAVE SEEN HER YES OH YES I HAVE SEEN HER ONCE OR TWICE BUT MARGARET KENDALL IS NOT A GIRL WHOM TO SEE IS TO KNOW BESIDES THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SUCH THAT WELL
7247-101864-0015 AND FATHER WAS IN BERMUDA THAT WINTER FOR HIS HEALTH MISSUS KENDALL HAD A DAUGHTER MARGARET ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD WHO WAS AT SCHOOL SOMEWHERE IN THE BERKSHIRES
7247-101864-0016 IT WAS TO THAT SCHOOL THAT I WENT WHEN THE TERRIBLE NEWS CAME THAT HARRY AND HIS NEW WIFE HAD LOST THEIR LIVES IN THAT AWFUL RAILROAD ACCIDENT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAW MARGARET THE POOR CHILD WAS OF COURSE HEARTBROKEN AND INCONSOLABLE
7247-101864-0017 BUT HER GRIEF TOOK A PECULIAR TURN THE MERE SIGHT OF ME DROVE HER ALMOST INTO HYSTERICS SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH ME OR WITH ANY OF HER STEPFATHER'S PEOPLE SHE REASONED THAT IF HER MOTHER HAD NOT MARRIED
7247-101864-0018 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEDDING JOURNEY AND IF THERE HAD BEEN NO WEDDING JOURNEY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENT AND THAT HER MOTHER WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN ALIVE AND WELL ARGUMENTS PLEADINGS AND ENTREATIES WERE IN VAIN SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME OR EVEN SEE ME
7247-101864-0019 SHE HELD HER HANDS BEFORE HER FACE AND SCREAMED IF I SO MUCH AS CAME INTO THE ROOM SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A CHILD OF COURSE AND NOT EVEN A NORMAL ONE AT THAT FOR SHE HAD HAD A VERY STRANGE LIFE AT FIVE SHE WAS LOST IN NEW YORK CITY
7247-101864-0020 AND FOR FOUR YEARS SHE LIVED ON THE STREETS AND IN THE SWEAT SHOPS ENDURING ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE POVERTY AND HARDSHIPS BY JOVE EXCLAIMED NED UNDER HIS BREATH IT WAS ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE THE WEDDING THAT SHE WAS FOUND WENT ON FRANK
7247-101864-0021 AND OF COURSE THE INFLUENCE OF THE WILD LIFE SHE HAD LED WAS STILL WITH HER MORE OR LESS AND MADE HER NOT EASILY SUBJECT TO CONTROL THERE WAS NOTHING FOR ME TO DO BUT TO LEAVE THE POOR LITTLE THING WHERE SHE WAS PARTICULARLY AS THERE SEEMED TO BE NO OTHER PLACE FOR HER
7247-101864-0022 SHE WOULD NOT COME WITH ME AND SHE HAD NO PEOPLE OF HER OWN TO WHOM SHE COULD TURN FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AS YOU KNOW POOR HARRY WAS CONSCIOUS FOR SOME HOURS AFTER THE ACCIDENT LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS WILL AND DICTATE THE LETTER TO ME
7247-101864-0023 LEAVING MARGARET TO MY CARE BOY THOUGH I WAS I WAS ONLY TWENTY YOU SEE BUT REALLY THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO WHOM HE COULD LEAVE HER THAT WAS SOMETHING OVER THIRTEEN YEARS AGO MARGARET MUST BE ABOUT TWENTY THREE NOW
7247-101864-0024 SHE STAYED AT THE BERKSHIRE SCHOOL FIVE YEARS THEN WITH SOME FEAR AND TREMBLING I OWN I WENT TO SEE HER I FOUND A GRAVE EYED LITTLE MISS WHO ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS WITH STUDIED POLITENESS
7247-101864-0025 AND WHO AGREED WITHOUT COMMENT TO THE PROPOSITION THAT I PLACE HER IN A SCHOOL WHERE SHE MIGHT REMAIN UNTIL SHE WAS READY FOR COLLEGE SHOULD SHE ELECT TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT HER VACATIONS DID SHE NEVER COME THEN QUESTIONED NED NO
7247-101864-0026 AT FIRST I DID NOT ASK HER OF COURSE IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION AS SHE WAS FEELING SOME ONE OF HER TEACHERS ALWAYS LOOKED OUT FOR HER THEY ALL PITIED HER AND NATURALLY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD FOR HER AS DID HER MATES AT SCHOOL
7247-101864-0027 LATER WHEN I DID DARE TO ASK HER TO COME HERE SHE ALWAYS REFUSED SHE WROTE ME STIFF LITTLE NOTES IN WHICH SHE INFORMED ME THAT SHE WAS TO SPEND THE HOLIDAYS WITH SOME BLANCHE OR DOROTHY OR MABEL OF HER ACQUAINTANCE
7247-101864-0028 SHE WAS NINETEEN WHEN I SAW HER AGAIN I FOUND NOW A CHARMING GRACEFUL GIRL WITH PECULIARLY HAUNTING BLUE EYES AND HEAVY COILS OF BRONZE GOLD HAIR THAT KINKED AND CURLED ABOUT HER LITTLE PINK EARS IN A MOST DISTRACTING FASHION
7247-101864-0029 EVEN NOW THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT COME TO MY HOME SHE WAS GOING ABROAD WITH FRIENDS THE PARTY INCLUDED AN IRREPROACHABLE CHAPERON SO OF COURSE I HAD NOTHING TO SAY WHILE AS FOR MONEY
7247-101864-0030 SHE HAD ALL OF HER MOTHER'S NOT INCONSIDERABLE FORTUNE BESIDES EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN HER STEPFATHER'S SO OF COURSE THERE WAS NO QUESTION ON THAT SCORE IN THE FALL SHE ENTERED COLLEGE
7247-101864-0031 WHEN SHE CAME OF AGE SHE SPECIALLY REQUESTED ME TO MAKE NO CHANGE IN HER AFFAIRS BUT TO REGARD HERSELF AS MY WARD FOR THE PRESENT JUST AS SHE HAD BEEN SO I STILL CALL MYSELF HER GUARDIAN THIS JUNE WAS HER GRADUATION
7247-101864-0032 I HAD FORGOTTEN THE FACT UNTIL I RECEIVED THE LITTLE ENGRAVED INVITATION A WEEK OR TWO AGO I THOUGHT OF RUNNING DOWN FOR IT BUT I COULDN'T GET AWAY VERY WELL AND WELL I DIDN'T GO THAT'S ALL
7247-101864-0033 BUT I DID WRITE AND ASK HER TO MAKE THIS HOUSE HER HOME AND HERE IS HER REPLY SHE THANKS ME AND WILL COME NEXT TUESDAY THERE NOW YOU HAVE IT YOU KNOW ALL THAT I DO AND FRANK SPENCER LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH A LONG SIGH
7247-101864-0034 NEITHER DO I OH BUT YOU'VE SEEN HER YES AND HOW
7247-101864-0035 NO I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS HOWEVER HE ADDED IT SEEMS THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER HER RETURN TO HER MOTHER'S HOME SHE HAD THE MOST ABSURD QUIXOTIC NOTIONS ABOUT SHARING ALL SHE HAD WITH EVERY RAGAMUFFIN IN NEW YORK
7247-101864-0036 SHE EVEN CARRIED HER DISTRESS OVER THEIR CONDITION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HER MOTHER REALLY FEARED FOR HER REASON ALL HER TEACHERS THEREFORE WERE INSTRUCTED TO KEEP FROM HER ALL FURTHER KNOWLEDGE OF POVERTY AND TROUBLE
7247-101864-0037 I DO HOPE THE CHILD IS WELL OVER THOSE NOTIONS I SHOULDN'T WANT HER TO MIX UP HERE WITH THE MILL PEOPLE I NEVER DID QUITE LIKE THOSE SETTLEMENT WOMEN ANYWAY AND ONLY THINK WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITH ONE IN ONE'S OWN FAMILY I DON'T THINK I SHOULD WORRY SISTER SWEET
7247-101864-0038 LAUGHED FRANK I HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF THE YOUNG LADY BUT I THINK I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH FOR THAT
