4710-17347-0000 NURNBERG AT THE TIME WAS NOT SO MUCH EXPLOITED AS IT HAS BEEN SINCE THEN
4710-17347-0001 AND CASUALLY REMARKED THAT HE WAS GOING ON TO SEE THE MOST ALL FIRED OLD METHUSELAH OF A TOWN IN YURRUP AND THAT HE GUESSED THAT SO MUCH TRAVELLING ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO SEND AN INTELLIGENT ACTIVE CITIZEN INTO THE MELANCHOLY WARD OF A DAFT HOUSE
4710-17347-0002 WE TOOK THE PRETTY BROAD HINT AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD JOIN FORCES WE FOUND ON COMPARING NOTES AFTERWARDS THAT WE HAD EACH INTENDED TO SPEAK WITH SOME DIFFIDENCE OR HESITATION SO AS NOT TO APPEAR TOO EAGER SUCH NOT BEING A GOOD COMPLIMENT TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR MARRIED LIFE
4710-17347-0003 STOPPING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THEN GOING ON TOGETHER AGAIN ANYHOW NO MATTER HOW IT WAS DONE AND ELIAS P HUTCHESON BECAME ONE OF OUR PARTY STRAIGHTWAY AMELIA AND I FOUND THE PLEASANT BENEFIT INSTEAD OF QUARRELLING
4710-17347-0004 AS WE HAD BEEN DOING WE FOUND THAT THE RESTRAINING INFLUENCE OF A THIRD PARTY WAS SUCH THAT WE NOW TOOK EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF SPOONING IN ODD CORNERS AMELIA DECLARES THAT EVER SINCE SHE HAS AS THE RESULT OF THAT EXPERIENCE ADVISED ALL HER FRIENDS TO TAKE A FRIEND ON THE HONEYMOON
4710-17347-0005 WELL WE DID NURNBERG TOGETHER AND MUCH ENJOYED THE RACY REMARKS OF OUR TRANSATLANTIC FRIEND
4710-17347-0006 AND ON THE DAY APPOINTED FOR THE VISIT STROLLED ROUND THE OUTER WALL OF THE CITY BY THE EASTERN SIDE THE BURG IS SEATED ON A ROCK DOMINATING THE TOWN AND AN IMMENSELY DEEP FOSSE GUARDS IT ON THE NORTHERN SIDE NURNBERG HAS BEEN HAPPY IN THAT IT WAS NEVER SACKED
4710-17347-0007 HAD IT BEEN IT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE SO SPICK AND SPAN PERFECT AS IT IS AT PRESENT THE DITCH HAS NOT BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES AND NOW ITS BASE IS SPREAD WITH TEA GARDENS AND ORCHARDS OF WHICH SOME OF THE TREES ARE OF QUITE RESPECTABLE GROWTH AS WE WANDERED ROUND THE WALL
4710-17347-0008 DAWDLING IN THE HOT JULY SUNSHINE WE OFTEN PAUSED TO ADMIRE THE VIEWS SPREAD BEFORE US AND IN ESPECIAL THE GREAT PLAIN COVERED WITH TOWNS AND VILLAGES AND BOUNDED WITH A BLUE LINE OF HILLS LIKE A LANDSCAPE OF CLAUDE LORRAINE FROM THIS WE ALWAYS TURNED WITH NEW DELIGHT TO THE CITY ITSELF
4710-17347-0009 WITH ITS MYRIAD OF QUAINT OLD GABLES AND ACRE WIDE RED ROOFS DOTTED WITH DORMER WINDOWS TIER UPON TIER A LITTLE TO OUR RIGHT ROSE THE TOWERS OF THE BURG AND NEARER STILL STANDING GRIM THE TORTURE TOWER WHICH WAS AND IS PERHAPS THE MOST INTERESTING PLACE IN THE CITY
4710-17347-0010 FOR CENTURIES THE TRADITION OF THE IRON VIRGIN OF NURNBERG HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN AS AN INSTANCE OF THE HORRORS OF CRUELTY OF WHICH MAN IS CAPABLE WE HAD LONG LOOKED FORWARD TO SEEING IT AND HERE AT LAST WAS ITS HOME
4710-17347-0011 THE GARDEN SEEMED QUITE FIFTY OR SIXTY FEET BELOW US
4710-17347-0012 BEYOND ROSE THE GREY GRIM WALL SEEMINGLY OF ENDLESS HEIGHT AND LOSING ITSELF RIGHT AND LEFT IN THE ANGLES OF BASTION AND COUNTERSCARP TREES AND BUSHES CROWNED THE WALL AND ABOVE AGAIN TOWERED THE LOFTY HOUSES ON WHOSE MASSIVE BEAUTY
4710-17347-0013 OR WOULD RAISE HER FEET AND PUSH AWAY THE LITTLE ONE AS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO FURTHER PLAY THEY WERE JUST AT THE FOOT OF THE WALL AND ELIAS P HUTCHESON IN ORDER TO HELP THE PLAY STOOPED AND TOOK FROM THE WALK A MODERATE SIZED PEBBLE SEE HE SAID
4710-17347-0014 I WILL DROP IT NEAR THE KITTEN AND THEY WILL BOTH WONDER WHERE IT CAME FROM OH BE CAREFUL SAID MY WIFE YOU MIGHT HIT THE DEAR LITTLE THING NOT ME MA'AM SAID ELIAS P WHY I'M AS TENDER AS A MAINE CHERRY TREE LOR BLESS YE
4710-17347-0015 BUT THE STONE FELL WITH A SICKENING THUD THAT CAME UP TO US THROUGH THE HOT AIR RIGHT ON THE KITTEN'S HEAD AND SHATTERED OUT ITS LITTLE BRAINS THEN AND THERE THE BLACK CAT CAST A SWIFT UPWARD GLANCE AND WE SAW HER EYES LIKE GREEN FIRE FIXED AN INSTANT ON ELIAS P HUTCHESON
4710-17347-0016 AND THEN HER ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE KITTEN WHICH LAY STILL WITH JUST A QUIVER OF HER TINY LIMBS WHILST A THIN RED STREAM TRICKLED FROM A GAPING WOUND WITH A MUFFLED CRY SUCH AS A HUMAN BEING MIGHT GIVE SHE BENT OVER THE KITTEN LICKING ITS WOUNDS AND MOANING
4710-17347-0017 SHARP TEETH SEEMED TO ALMOST SHINE THROUGH THE BLOOD WHICH DABBLED HER MOUTH AND WHISKERS SHE GNASHED HER TEETH AND HER CLAWS STOOD OUT STARK AND AT FULL LENGTH ON EVERY PAW
4710-17347-0018 THERE WAS A SEAT CLOSE BY IN SHADE OF A SPREADING PLANE TREE AND HERE I PLACED HER WHILST SHE COMPOSED HERSELF THEN I WENT BACK TO HUTCHESON WHO STOOD WITHOUT MOVING LOOKING DOWN ON THE ANGRY CAT BELOW AS I JOINED HIM HE SAID
4710-17347-0019 I KEM ON THE CAMP JUST IN TIME TO SEE SPLINTERS PASS IN HIS CHECKS
4710-17347-0020 IT'S HERE NOW AND HE SLAPPED THE BREAST POCKET OF HIS COAT
4710-17347-0021 AND AT EVERY TUMBLE HER APPEARANCE BECAME MORE HORRIBLE
4710-17347-0022 JUST SHOWS WHAT A CLUMSY FOOL OF A MAN CAN DO WHEN HE TRIES TO PLAY SEEMS I'M TOO DARNED SLIPPERHANDED TO EVEN PLAY WITH A CAT SAY COLONEL IT WAS A PLEASANT WAY HE HAD TO BESTOW TITLES FREELY
4710-17347-0023 WHY I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD IT OCCUR ON NO ACCOUNT HE CAME OVER TO AMELIA AND APOLOGISED PROFUSELY AND SHE WITH HER USUAL KINDNESS OF HEART HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM THAT SHE QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THEN WE ALL WENT AGAIN TO THE WALL AND LOOKED OVER
4710-17347-0024 WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN GROTESQUE ONLY THAT IT WAS SO FRIGHTFULLY REAL
4710-17347-0025 RECOGNISES THE VOICE OF A MASTER AND BOWS TO HIM LIKE A SQUAW WAS THE ONLY COMMENT OF ELIAS P HUTCHESON
4710-17347-0026 TOOK IT IN HER MOUTH AND SO FOLLOWED AFTER A WHILE HOWEVER SHE ABANDONED THIS FOR WE SAW HER FOLLOWING ALL ALONE SHE HAD EVIDENTLY HIDDEN THE BODY SOMEWHERE AMELIA'S ALARM GREW AT THE CAT'S PERSISTENCE AND MORE THAN ONCE SHE REPEATED HER WARNING
4710-17347-0027 BUT THE AMERICAN ALWAYS LAUGHED WITH AMUSEMENT TILL FINALLY
4710-17347-0028 I SAY MA'AM YOU NEEDN'T BE SKEERED OVER THAT CAT I GO HEELED I DU HERE HE SLAPPED HIS PISTOL POCKET AT THE BACK OF HIS LUMBAR REGION
4710-17347-0029 AS HE SPOKE HE LOOKED OVER THE WALL BUT THE CAT ON SEEING HIM RETREATED WITH A GROWL INTO A BED OF TALL FLOWERS AND WAS HIDDEN HE WENT ON
4710-17347-0030 WHENCE RAN THE STEEP PAVED ROADWAY BETWEEN THE BURG AND THE PENTAGONAL TORTURE TOWER AS WE CROSSED THE BRIDGE WE SAW THE CAT AGAIN DOWN BELOW US
4710-17347-0031 AND THEN WE PASSED THROUGH THE LONG DIM ARCHWAY AND CAME TO THE GATE OF THE BURG
