7498-99124-0000 TO ALL THE CHARMS OF BEAUTY AND THE UTMOST ELEGANCE OF EXTERNAL FORM MARY ADDED THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH RENDER THEIR IMPRESSION IRRESISTIBLE POLITE AFFABLE INSINUATING SPRIGHTLY
7498-99124-0001 AND CAPABLE OF SPEAKING AND WRITING WITH EQUAL EASE AND DIGNITY SUDDEN HOWEVER AND VIOLENT IN ALL HER ATTACHMENTS BECAUSE HER HEART WAS WARM AND UNSUSPICIOUS IMPATIENT OF CONTRADICTION
7498-99124-0002 BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED FROM HER INFANCY TO BE TREATED AS A QUEEN NO STRANGER ON SOME OCCASIONS TO DISSIMULATION WHICH IN THAT PERFIDIOUS COURT WHERE SHE RECEIVED HER EDUCATION
7498-99124-0003 WAS RECKONED AMONG THE NECESSARY ARTS OF GOVERNMENT NOT INSENSIBLE TO FLATTERY OR UNCONSCIOUS OF THAT PLEASURE WITH WHICH ALMOST EVERY WOMAN BEHOLDS THE INFLUENCE OF HER OWN BEAUTY
7498-99124-0004 FORMED WITH THE QUALITIES WHICH WE LOVE NOT WITH THE TALENTS THAT WE ADMIRE SHE WAS AN AGREEABLE WOMAN RATHER THAN AN ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN
7498-99124-0005 THE VIVACITY OF HER SPIRIT NOT SUFFICIENTLY TEMPERED WITH SOUND JUDGMENT AND THE WARMTH OF HER HEART WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL TIMES UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF DISCRETION BETRAYED HER BOTH INTO ERRORS AND INTO CRIMES
7498-99124-0006 TO SAY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE WILL NOT ACCOUNT FOR THAT LONG AND ALMOST UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESSION OF CALAMITIES WHICH BEFELL HER WE MUST LIKEWISE ADD THAT SHE WAS OFTEN IMPRUDENT
7498-99124-0007 HER PASSION FOR DARNLEY WAS RASH YOUTHFUL AND EXCESSIVE AND THOUGH THE SUDDEN TRANSITION TO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME WAS THE NATURAL EFFECT OF HER ILL REQUITED LOVE AND OF HIS INGRATITUDE INSOLENCE AND BRUTALITY
7498-99124-0008 YET NEITHER THESE NOR BOTHWELL'S ARTFUL ADDRESS AND IMPORTANT SERVICES CAN JUSTIFY HER ATTACHMENTS TO THAT NOBLEMAN EVEN THE MANNERS OF THE AGE LICENTIOUS AS THEY WERE
7498-99124-0009 ARE NO APOLOGY FOR THIS UNHAPPY PASSION NOR CAN THEY INDUCE US TO LOOK ON THAT TRAGICAL AND INFAMOUS SCENE WHICH FOLLOWED UPON IT WITH LESS ABHORRENCE
7498-99124-0010 HUMANITY WILL DRAW A VEIL OVER THIS PART OF HER CHARACTER WHICH IT CANNOT APPROVE AND MAY PERHAPS PROMPT SOME TO IMPUTE HER ACTIONS TO HER SITUATION MORE THAN TO HER DISPOSITIONS AND TO LAMENT THE UNHAPPINESS OF THE FORMER
7498-99124-0011 RATHER THAN ACCUSE THE PERVERSENESS OF THE LATTER MARY'S SUFFERINGS EXCEED BOTH IN DEGREE AND DURATION THOSE TRAGICAL DISTRESSES WHICH FANCY HAS FEIGNED TO EXCITE SORROW AND COMMISERATION
7498-99124-0012 AND WHILE WE SURVEY THEM WE ARE APT ALTOGETHER TO FORGET HER FRAILTIES WE THINK OF HER FAULTS WITH LESS INDIGNATION AND APPROVE OF OUR TEARS
7498-99124-0013 AS IF THEY WERE SHED FOR A PERSON WHO HAD ATTAINED MUCH NEARER TO PURE VIRTUE WITH REGARD TO THE QUEEN'S PERSON A CIRCUMSTANCE NOT TO BE OMITTED IN WRITING THE HISTORY OF A FEMALE REIGN
7498-99124-0014 ALL CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS AGREE IN ASCRIBING TO MARY THE UTMOST BEAUTY OF COUNTENANCE AND ELEGANCE OF SHAPE OF WHICH THE HUMAN FORM IS CAPABLE HER HAIR WAS BLACK ALTHOUGH ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THAT AGE
7498-99124-0015 HER EYES WERE A DARK GREY HER COMPLEXION WAS EXQUISITELY FINE AND HER HANDS AND ARMS REMARKABLY DELICATE BOTH AS TO SHAPE AND COLOUR HER STATURE WAS OF AN HEIGHT THAT ROSE TO THE MAJESTIC
7498-99124-0016 SHE DANCED WALKED AND RODE WITH EQUAL GRACE HER TASTE FOR MUSIC WAS JUST AND SHE BOTH SUNG AND PLAYED UPON THE LUTE WITH UNCOMMON SKILL
7498-99124-0017 TOWARDS THE END OF HER LIFE LONG CONFINEMENT AND THE COLDNESS OF THE HOUSES IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED BROUGHT ON A RHEUMATISM WHICH OFTEN DEPRIVED HER OF THE USE OF HER LIMBS NO MAN SAYS BRANTOME
7498-99124-0018 EVER BEHELD HER PERSON WITHOUT ADMIRATION AND LOVE
