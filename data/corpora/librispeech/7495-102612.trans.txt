7495-102612-0015 HE SMILED A LITTLE AS HE COMPLIED WITH THE YOUNG LADY'S INVITATION BUT THE EXPRESSION OF ECSTASY DID NOT COME ARE MISTER ROSSITUR'S CIRCUMSTANCES SO MUCH REDUCED HE SAID DRAWING NEARER TO MISSUS EVELYN DO YOU KNOW THEM
7495-102612-0016 I KNEW MISSUS ROSSITUR VERY WELL SOME YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS IN PARIS THEY ARE ALL BROKEN TO PIECES SAID MISSUS EVELYN AS MISTER CARLETON'S EYE WENT BACK TO HER FOR HIS ANSWER MISTER ROSSITUR FAILED AND LOST EVERYTHING BANKRUPT A YEAR OR TWO AFTER THEY CAME HOME

7495-102612-0019 I WISH YOU HAD HEARD HER YESTERDAY IT WAS BEYOND EVERYTHING WE WERE CONVERSING VERY AMICABLY REGARDING EACH OTHER THROUGH A FRIENDLY VISTA FORMED BY THE SUGAR BOWL AND TEA POT WHEN A HORRID MAN
7495-102612-0020 FLEDA WENT OFF INTO A EULOGIUM UPON THE INTELLIGENCE OF HAY MAKERS IN GENERAL AND THE STRENGTH OF MIND BARBARIANS ARE UNIVERSALLY KNOWN TO POSSESS THE MANNER STILL MORE THAN THE MATTER OF THIS SPEECH WAS BEYOND THE WITHSTANDING OF ANY GOOD NATURED MUSCLES
7495-102612-0021 THOUGH THE GENTLEMAN'S SMILE WAS A GRAVE ONE AND QUICKLY LOST IN GRAVITY MISSUS EVELYN LAUGHED AND REPROVED IN A BREATH BUT THE LAUGH WAS ADMIRING AND THE REPROOF WAS STIMULATIVE
7495-102612-0022 AND THIS HAS BEEN HER LIFE EVER SINCE MISTER ROSSITUR LOST HIS PROPERTY ENTIRELY SACRIFICED SAID MISSUS EVELYN WITH A COMPASSIONATELY RESIGNED AIR EDUCATION ADVANTAGES AND EVERYTHING GIVEN UP

7495-102612-0026 YES SAID MISSUS EVELYN SHE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS STATE OF THINGS IT'S HER LIFE
7495-102612-0027 AND RAISES VEGETABLES FOR MARKET AND OVERSEES HER UNCLE'S FARMERS AND IT ISN'T A HARDSHIP TO HER SHE FINDS HER HAPPINESS IN IT SHE IS A VERY GOOD GIRL BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE SOMETHING MUCH BETTER THAN A FARMER'S WIFE
7495-102612-0028 YOU MAY SET YOUR MIND AT REST ON THAT SUBJECT MAMMA SAID CONSTANCE STILL USING HER CHOP STICKS WITH GREAT COMPLACENCY IT'S MY OPINION THAT THE FARMER IS NOT IN EXISTENCE WHO IS BLESSED WITH SUCH A CONJUGAL FUTURITY
7495-102612-0029 I THINK FLEDA'S STRONG PASTORAL TASTES ARE LIKELY TO DEVELOPE THEMSELVES IN A NEW DIRECTION MISSUS EVELYN LOOKED WITH A PARTIAL SMILE AT THE PRETTY FEATURES WHICH THE BUSINESS OF EATING THE STRAWBERRIES DISPLAYED IN SUNDRY NOVEL AND PICTURESQUE POINTS OF VIEW
7495-102612-0030 AND ASKED WHAT SHE MEANT I DON'T KNOW SAID CONSTANCE INTENT UPON HER BASKET I FEEL A FRIEND'S DISTRESS FOR MISTER THORN IT'S ALL YOUR DOING MAMMA YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LOOK HIM IN THE FACE WHEN WE HAVE FLEDA NEXT FALL
7495-102612-0031 BUT SHE WENT AWAY BEFORE ANYTHING WAS DECIDED I DON'T THINK HE HAS FORGOTTEN HER I SHOULDN'T THINK ANYBODY COULD FORGET HER SAID EDITH I AM CONFIDENT HE WOULD BE HERE AT THIS MOMENT SAID CONSTANCE IF HE WASN'T IN LONDON
7495-102612-0032 BUT WHAT IS ALL MAMMA'S DOING CONSTANCE INQUIRED HER SISTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PEACE OF THE WHOLE FAMILY OF THORNS SHOULDN'T SLEEP SOUND IN MY BED IF I WERE SHE WITH SUCH A REFLECTION
7495-102612-0033 I LOOK FORWARD TO HEART RENDING SCENES WITH A VERY DISTURBED STATE OF MIND BUT WHAT HAVE I DONE MY CHILD SAID MISSUS EVELYN DIDN'T YOU INTRODUCE YOUR FAVOURITE MISTER OLMNEY TO MISS RINGGAN LAST SUMMER
7495-102612-0034 I DON'T KNOW HER NATIVE DELICACY SHRUNK FROM MAKING ANY DISCLOSURES AND OF COURSE THE TONGUE OF FRIENDSHIP IS SILENT BUT THEY WERE OUT AGES YESTERDAY WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR HER AND THEIR PARTING AT THE GATE WAS I FEEL MYSELF UNEQUAL TO THE TASK OF DESCRIBING IT
7495-102612-0035 SAID CONSTANCE ECSTATICALLY AND SHE WAS IN THE MOST ELEVATED TONE OF MIND DURING OUR WHOLE INTERVIEW AFTERWARDS AND TOOK ALL MY BRILLIANT REMARKS WITH AS MUCH COOLNESS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DROPS OF RAIN MORE I PRESUME CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS HAY TIME
7495-102612-0036 DID YOU SEE HIM SAID MISSUS EVELYN ONLY AT THAT IMPRACTICABLE DISTANCE MAMMA BUT I INTRODUCED HIS NAME AFTERWARDS IN MY USUAL HAPPY MANNER AND I FOUND THAT MISS RINGGAN'S CHEEKS WERE BY NO MEANS INDIFFERENT TO IT I DIDN'T DARE GO ANY FURTHER
7495-102612-0037 I AM VERY GLAD OF IT I HOPE IT IS SO SAID MISSUS EVELYN ENERGETICALLY
7495-102612-0038 YOU ARE EXCITING GLOOMY FEELINGS IN MISTER CARLETON'S MIND MAMMA BY YOUR FELICITOUS SUGGESTIONS MISTER CARLETON DID YOUR EARS RECEIVE A FAINT ANNOUNCEMENT OF HAM AND EGGS WHICH WENT QUITE THROUGH AND THROUGH MINE JUST NOW
7495-102612-0039 HE BOWED AND HANDED THE YOUNG LADY IN BUT CONSTANCE DECLARED THAT THOUGH HE SAT BESIDE HER AND TOOK CARE OF HER AT BREAKFAST HE HAD ON ONE OF HIS INTANGIBLE FITS WHICH DROVE HER TO THE LAST EXTREME OF IMPATIENCE AND CAPTIVATION
7495-102612-0040 THE SUN WAS NOT MUCH MORE THAN TWO HOURS HIGH THE NEXT MORNING WHEN A RIDER WAS SLOWLY APPROACHING MISTER ROSSITUR'S HOUSE FROM THE BRIDGE WALKING HIS HORSE LIKE A MAN WHO WISHED TO LOOK WELL AT ALL HE WAS PASSING
7495-102612-0041 MISTER SWEET MUST SEND FOR THEM IF HE WANTS THEM PHILETUS MUST MAKE HASTE BACK FOR YOU KNOW MISTER DOUGLASS WANTS HIM TO HELP IN THE BARN MEADOW LUCAS WON'T BE HERE AND NOW THE WEATHER IS SO FINE I WANT TO MAKE HASTE WITH THE HAY WELL WILL YOU HAVE THE SAMP FOR BREAKFAST NO WE'LL KEEP THAT FOR DINNER
