7285-72200-0000 REVENGE AT FIRST THOUGH SWEET BITTER ERELONG BACK ON ITSELF RECOILS MILTON'S PARADISE LOST AT THE INSTANT OF DISCHARGING HIS REVOLVER
7285-72200-0001 JACKSON FELT A SHARP STINGING PAIN IN HIS RIGHT ARM AND IT DROPPED USELESS AT HIS SIDE HE HOPED HE HAD KILLED BOTH MISTER TRAVILLA AND ELSIE
7285-72200-0002 DID NOT DARE TO REMAIN A MOMENT TO LEARN WITH CERTAINTY THE EFFECT OF HIS SHOT BUT RUSHING ALONG THE VERANDA THREW HIMSELF OVER THE RAILING AND SLIDING DOWN A PILLAR BY THE AID OF THE ONE HAND AND WITH NO LITTLE PAIN AND DIFFICULTY
7285-72200-0003 MADE OFF WITH ALL SPEED ACROSS THE LAWN BUT HE WAS BLEEDING AT SO FEARFUL A RATE THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF COMPELLED TO PAUSE LONG ENOUGH TO IMPROVISE A TOURNIQUET BY KNOTTING HIS HANDKERCHIEF ABOVE THE WOUND
7285-72200-0004 TYING IT AS TIGHTLY AS HE COULD WITH THE LEFT HAND AIDED BY HIS TEETH HE STOOPED AND FELT ON THE GROUND IN THE DARKNESS AND RAIN FOR A STICK BY MEANS OF WHICH TO TIGHTEN IT STILL MORE FOR THE BLEEDING THOUGH CONSIDERABLY CHECKED
7285-72200-0005 WAS BY NO MEANS STANCHED BUT STICKS STONES AND EVERY KIND OF LITTER HAD LONG BEEN BANISHED THENCE HIS FINGERS CAME IN CONTACT WITH NOTHING BUT THE SMOOTH VELVETY TURF AND WITH A MUTTERED CURSE
7285-72200-0006 HE ROSE AND FLED AGAIN FOR THE FLASHING OF LIGHTS THE LOUD RINGING OF A BELL PEAL AFTER PEAL AND SOUNDS OF RUNNING FEET AND MANY VOICES IN HIGH EXCITED TONES TOLD HIM THERE WAS DANGER OF A QUICK AND HOT PURSUIT
7285-72200-0007 CLEARING THE LAWN HE PRESENTLY STRUCK INTO A BRIDLE PATH THAT LED TO THE WOODS HERE HE AGAIN PAUSED TO SEARCH FOR THE MUCH NEEDED STICK FOUND ONE SUITED TO HIS PURPOSE
7285-72200-0008 PANTING WITH WEAKNESS PAIN AND AFFRIGHT LEAVING THE PATH HE PLUNGED DEEPER INTO THE WOODS RAN FOR SOME DISTANCE ALONG THE EDGE OF A SWAMP AND LEAPING IN UP TO HIS KNEES IN MUD AND WATER DOUBLED ON HIS TRACK THEN TURNED AGAIN
7285-72200-0009 AND PENETRATING FARTHER AND FARTHER INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE MORASS FINALLY CLIMBED A TREE GROANING WITH THE PAIN THE EFFORT COST HIM AND CONCEALED HIMSELF AMONG THE BRANCHES HIS PURSUERS CAME UP TO THE SPOT
7285-72200-0010 WHERE HE HAD MADE HIS PLUNGE INTO THE WATER HERE THEY PAUSED EVIDENTLY AT FAULT HE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF THEIR FOOTSTEPS AND VOICES AND JUDGE OF THEIR MOVEMENTS BY THE GLEAM OF THE TORCHES MANY OF THEM CARRIED
7285-72200-0011 SOME NOW TOOK ONE DIRECTION SOME ANOTHER AND HE PERCEIVED WITH JOY THAT HIS STRATAGEM HAD BEEN AT LEAST PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL ONE PARTY HOWEVER SOON FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE SWAMP
7285-72200-0012 HE COULD HEAR SPRIGGS URGING THEM ON AND ANATHEMATIZING HIM AS A SCOUNDREL ROBBER BURGLAR MURDERER WHO OUGHT TO BE SWUNG UP TO THE NEAREST TREE
7285-72200-0013 EVERY THICKET WAS UNDERGOING A THOROUGH SEARCH HEADS WERE THROWN BACK AND TORCHES HELD HIGH THAT EAGER BLACKS EYES MIGHT SCAN THE TREE TOPS AND JACKSON BEGAN TO GROW SICK WITH THE ALMOST CERTAINTY OF BEING TAKEN
7285-72200-0014 AS SEVERAL STOUT NEGROES DREW NEARER AND NEARER HIS CHOSEN HIDING PLACE HE UTTERED A LOW BREATHED IMPRECATION UPON HIS USELESS RIGHT ARM AND THE MAN WHOSE SURE AIM HAD MADE IT SO
7285-72200-0015 BUT FOR YOU HE MUTTERED GRINDING HIS TEETH I'D SELL MY LIFE DEAR BUT THE RAIN WHICH HAD SLACKENED FOR A TIME AGAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS
7285-72200-0016 THE TORCHES SPUTTERED AND WENT OUT AND THE PURSUERS TURNED BACK IN HASTE TO GAIN THE FIRMER SOIL WHERE LESS DANGER WAS TO BE APPREHENDED FROM ALLIGATORS PANTHERS AND POISONOUS REPTILES
7285-72200-0017 THE SEARCH WAS KEPT UP FOR SOME TIME LONGER WITH NO LIGHT BUT AN OCCASIONAL FLASH FROM THE SKIES BUT FINALLY ABANDONED AS WE HAVE SEEN
7285-72200-0018 JACKSON PASSED SEVERAL HOURS MOST UNCOMFORTABLY AND PAINFULLY ON HIS ELEVATED PERCH QUAKING WITH FEAR OF BOTH MAN AND REPTILE NOT DARING TO COME DOWN OR TO SLEEP IN HIS PRECARIOUS POSITION
7285-72200-0019 OR ABLE TO DO SO FOR THE PAIN OF HIS WOUND AND GROWING HOUR BY HOUR WEAKER FROM THE BLEEDING WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CHECK ENTIRELY THEN HIS MIND WAS IN A STATE OF GREAT DISTURBANCE
7285-72200-0020 HIS WOUND MUST BE DRESSED AND THAT SPEEDILY YET HOW COULD IT BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT IMPERILING LIFE AND LIBERTY PERHAPS HE HAD NOW TWO NEW MURDERS ON HIS HANDS HE DID NOT KNOW
7285-72200-0021 AN EXCELLENT PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON LIVED ON A PLANTATION
7285-72200-0022 HE MUST CONTRIVE A PLAUSIBLE STORY AND GO TO HIM
7285-72200-0023 WOULD BE LIKELY TO REACH HIM IT WOULD BE A RISK BUT WHAT BETTER COULD BE DONE HE MIGHT SUCCEED IN QUIETING THE DOCTOR'S SUSPICIONS AND YET MAKE GOOD HIS ESCAPE FROM THE VICINITY
7285-72200-0024 THE STORM HAD SPENT ITSELF BEFORE THE BREAK OF DAY AND DESCENDING FROM HIS PERCH WITH THE FIRST FAINT RAYS OF LIGHT THAT PENETRATED THE GLOOMY RECESSES OF THE SWAMP HE MADE HIS WAY OUT OF IT
7285-72200-0025 SLOWLY AND TOILSOMELY WITH WEARY ACHING LIMBS SUFFERING INTENSELY FROM THE GNAWINGS OF HUNGER AND THIRST THE PAIN OF HIS INJURY AND THE FEAR OF BEING OVERTAKEN BY THE AVENGERS OF HIS INNOCENT VICTIMS
7285-72200-0026 TRULY AS THE BIBLE TELLS US THE WAY OF TRANSGRESSORS IS HARD
7285-72200-0027 READY TO START UPON HIS MORNING ROUND AND PACING THOUGHTFULLY TO AND FRO UPON THE VERANDA OF HIS DWELLING WHILE WAITING FOR HIS HORSE SAW A MISERABLE LOOKING OBJECT COMING UP THE AVENUE
7285-72200-0028 A MAN ALMOST COVERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH BLOOD AND MUD A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF ALSO BOTH BLOODY AND MUDDY KNOTTED AROUND THE RIGHT ARM WHICH HUNG APPARENTLY USELESS AT HIS SIDE
7285-72200-0029 THE MAN REELED AS HE WALKED EITHER FROM INTOXICATION OR WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE THE DOCTOR JUDGED THE LATTER
7285-72200-0030 NAP GO AND HELP THAT MAN INTO THE OFFICE THEN HURRYING THITHER HIMSELF GOT OUT LINT BANDAGES INSTRUMENTS WHATEVER MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR THE DRESSING OF A WOUND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF NAP'S STRONG ARM
7285-72200-0031 THE MAN TOTTERED IN THEN SANK HALF FAINTING INTO A CHAIR A GLASS OF WINE NAP QUICK CRIED THE DOCTOR SPRINKLING SOME WATER IN HIS PATIENT'S FACE AND APPLYING AMMONIA TO HIS NOSTRILS
7285-72200-0032 HE REVIVED SUFFICIENTLY TO SWALLOW WITH EAGER AVIDITY THE WINE NAP HELD TO HIS LIPS FOOD FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HE GASPED I'M STARVING
7285-72200-0033 BREAD MEAT COFFEE ANYTHING THAT IS ON THE TABLE NAP SAID HIS MASTER AND DON'T LET THE GRASS GROW UNDER YOUR FEET THEN TO THE STRANGER AND TAKING GENTLE HOLD OF THE WOUNDED LIMB
7285-72200-0034 BUT YOU NEED THIS FLOW OF BLOOD STANCHED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAME TO ME FOR SURGICAL AID OF COURSE
7285-72200-0035 NEVER MIND I'LL HEAR YOUR STORY AFTER YOUR ARM'S DRESSED AND YOU'VE HAD YOUR BREAKFAST YOU HAVEN'T STRENGTH FOR TALK JUST NOW
7285-72200-0036 BARED THE SWOLLEN LIMB AND CAREFULLY DRESSED THE WOUND BUT KEPT THEM TO HIMSELF THE STRANGER'S CLOTHES THOUGH MUCH SOILED AND TORN IN SEVERAL PLACES BY CONTACT WITH THORNS AND BRIERS WERE OF GOOD MATERIAL
7285-72200-0037 FASHIONABLE CUT AND NOT OLD OR WORN HIS MANNERS WERE GENTLEMANLY AND HIS SPEECH WAS THAT OF AN EDUCATED MAN BUT ALL THIS WAS NO PROOF THAT HE WAS NOT A VILLAIN IS THAT MORTIFICATION
7285-72200-0038 WILL THE LIMB EVER BE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AGAIN OH YES NEITHER THE BONE NOR NERVE HAS SUFFERED INJURY THE BALL HAS GLANCED FROM THE BONE PASSED UNDER THE NERVE AND CUT THE HUMERAL ARTERY
7285-72200-0039 YOUR TOURNIQUET HAS SAVED YOU FROM BLEEDING TO DEATH TIS WELL YOU KNEW ENOUGH TO APPLY IT THE FLESH IS MUCH TORN WHERE THE BALL PASSED OUT BUT THAT WILL HEAL IN TIME THE DOCTOR'S TASK WAS DONE
7285-72200-0040 NAP HAD SET A PLATE OF FOOD WITHIN REACH OF THE STRANGER'S LEFT HAND AND HE WAS DEVOURING IT LIKE A HUNGRY WOLF NOW SIR SAID THE GOOD DOCTOR WHEN THE MEAL WAS FINISHED
7285-72200-0041 I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR HOW YOU CAME BY THAT UGLY WOUND I CAN'T DENY THAT THINGS LOOK SUSPICIOUS I KNOW EVERYBODY HIGH AND LOW RICH AND POOR FOR MILES IN EVERY DIRECTION
7285-72200-0042 NO A PARTY OF US FROM NEW ORLEANS LAST CAME OUT TO VISIT THIS BEAUTIFUL REGION WE WERE ROAMING THROUGH A FOREST YESTERDAY LOOKING FOR GAME WHEN I SOMEHOW GOT SEPARATED FROM THE REST
7285-72200-0043 LOST MY WAY DARKNESS CAME ON AND WONDERING HITHER AND THITHER IN THE VAIN EFFORT TO FIND MY COMRADES TUMBLING OVER LOGS AND FALLEN TREES SCRATCHED AND TORN BY BRAMBLES ALMOST EATEN UP BY MOSQUITOS

7285-72200-0046 I HAD BUT LITTLE STRENGTH WHEN DAYLIGHT CAME AND I COULD SEE TO GET OUT OF SWAMP AND WOODS AND COME ON HERE THE DOCTOR LISTENED IN SILENCE HIS FACE TELLING NOTHING OF HIS THOUGHTS A BAD BUSINESS
7285-72200-0047 HE SAID RISING AND BEGINNING TO DRAW ON HIS GLOVES YOU ARE NOT FIT TO TRAVEL BUT ARE WELCOME TO STAY HERE FOR THE PRESENT HAD BETTER LIE DOWN ON THE SOFA THERE AND TAKE A NAP WHILE I AM AWAY VISITING MY PATIENTS
