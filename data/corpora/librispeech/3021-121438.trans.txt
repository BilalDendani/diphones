3021-121438-0000 IT WAS IN FACT MORDAUNT WHOM D'ARTAGNAN HAD FOLLOWED WITHOUT KNOWING IT
3021-121438-0001 THEN MOUNTING A STAIRCASE HAD OPENED A DOOR
3021-121438-0002 THIS MAN WAS CROMWELL CROMWELL HAD TWO OR THREE OF THESE RETREATS IN LONDON
3021-121438-0003 IT IS YOU MORDAUNT HE SAID YOU ARE LATE GENERAL I WISHED TO SEE THE CEREMONY TO THE END WHICH DELAYED ME AH I SCARCELY THOUGHT YOU WERE SO CURIOUS AS THAT I AM ALWAYS CURIOUS TO SEE THE DOWNFALL OF YOUR HONOR'S ENEMIES AND HE WAS NOT AMONG THE LEAST OF THEM
3021-121438-0004 BUT YOU GENERAL WERE YOU NOT AT WHITEHALL NO SAID CROMWELL THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE HAVE YOU HAD ANY ACCOUNT OF IT NONE
3021-121438-0005 AH YOU KNEW THAT SAID MORDAUNT IT MATTERS LITTLE FOUR MEN DISGUISED AS WORKMEN
3021-121438-0006 AND KNOWING ALL THAT YOUR HONOR REMAINED HERE FAR FROM THE CITY TRANQUIL AND INACTIVE TRANQUIL YES REPLIED CROMWELL BUT WHO TOLD YOU I WAS INACTIVE BUT IF THE PLOT HAD SUCCEEDED I WISHED IT TO DO SO
3021-121438-0007 YES HIS DEATH BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SEEMLY NOT UPON THE SCAFFOLD WHY SO ASKED MORDAUNT CROMWELL SMILED
3021-121438-0008 THAT I HAD HAD HIM CONDEMNED FOR THE SAKE OF JUSTICE AND HAD LET HIM ESCAPE OUT OF PITY BUT
3021-121438-0009 IMPOSSIBLE MY PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN AND DOES YOUR HONOR KNOW THE FOUR MEN WHO UNDERTOOK TO RESCUE HIM THE FOUR FRENCHMEN OF WHOM TWO WERE SENT BY THE QUEEN TO HER HUSBAND AND TWO BY MAZARIN TO ME
3021-121438-0010 AND DO YOU THINK MAZARIN COMMISSIONED THEM TO ACT AS THEY HAVE DONE IT IS POSSIBLE BUT HE WILL NOT AVOW IT HOW SO BECAUSE THEY FAILED YOUR HONOR GAVE ME
3021-121438-0011 NOW THAT THEY ARE GUILTY OF A CONSPIRACY AGAINST ENGLAND WILL YOUR HONOR GIVE ME ALL FOUR OF THEM TAKE THEM SAID CROMWELL MORDAUNT BOWED WITH A SMILE OF TRIUMPHANT FEROCITY DID THE PEOPLE SHOUT AT ALL CROMWELL ASKED VERY LITTLE EXCEPT LONG LIVE CROMWELL
3021-121438-0012 I WAS SO SITUATED AS TO HEAR AND SEE EVERYTHING HE ANSWERED IT WAS NOW CROMWELL'S TURN TO LOOK FIXEDLY AT MORDAUNT AND MORDAUNT TO MAKE HIMSELF IMPENETRABLE IT APPEARS SAID CROMWELL THAT THIS IMPROVISED EXECUTIONER DID HIS DUTY REMARKABLY WELL
3021-121438-0013 MORDAUNT REMEMBERED THAT CROMWELL HAD TOLD HIM HE HAD HAD NO DETAILED ACCOUNT
3021-121438-0014 HIDDEN BEHIND SOME SCREEN OR CURTAIN IN FACT SAID MORDAUNT WITH A CALM VOICE AND IMMOVABLE COUNTENANCE A SINGLE BLOW SUFFICED PERHAPS IT WAS SOME ONE IN THAT OCCUPATION SAID CROMWELL DO YOU THINK SO SIR HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN EXECUTIONER
3021-121438-0015 BUT SAID MORDAUNT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME PERSONAL ENEMY OF THE KING WHO HAD MADE A VOW OF VENGEANCE AND ACCOMPLISHED IT IN THIS WAY PERHAPS IT WAS SOME MAN OF RANK WHO HAD GRAVE REASONS FOR HATING THE FALLEN KING
3021-121438-0016 THREW HIMSELF IN THE WAY WITH A MASK ON HIS FACE AND AN AXE IN HIS HAND
3021-121438-0017 BUT AS AN AMBASSADOR OF FATE POSSIBLY AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE WOULD YOUR HONOR CONDEMN HIS ACTION IT IS NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE IT RESTS BETWEEN HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS GOD BUT IF YOUR HONOR KNEW THIS MAN
3021-121438-0018 IT IS THE AXE NOT THE MAN WE MUST THANK AND YET WITHOUT THE MAN
3021-121438-0019 CROMWELL SMILED THEY WOULD HAVE CARRIED HIM TO GREENWICH HE SAID AND PUT HIM ON BOARD A FELUCCA WITH FIVE BARRELS OF POWDER IN THE HOLD ONCE OUT TO SEA YOU ARE TOO GOOD A POLITICIAN NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE REST MORDAUNT YES
3021-121438-0020 THEY WOULD HAVE ALL BEEN BLOWN UP JUST SO THE EXPLOSION WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT THE AXE HAD FAILED TO DO
3021-121438-0021 YOU SEE NOW WHY I DID NOT CARE TO KNOW YOUR GENTLEMAN IN THE MASK
3021-121438-0022 IN SPITE OF HIS EXCELLENT INTENTIONS I COULD NOT THANK HIM FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE MORDAUNT BOWED HUMBLY SIR HE SAID YOU ARE A PROFOUND THINKER AND YOUR PLAN WAS SUBLIME SAY ABSURD SINCE IT HAS BECOME USELESS
3021-121438-0023 THE ONLY SUBLIME IDEAS IN POLITICS ARE THOSE WHICH BEAR FRUIT SO TO NIGHT MORDAUNT GO TO GREENWICH AND ASK FOR THE CAPTAIN OF THE FELUCCA LIGHTNING SHOW HIM A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF KNOTTED AT THE FOUR CORNERS AND TELL THE CREW TO DISEMBARK AND CARRY THE POWDER BACK TO THE ARSENAL UNLESS INDEED
3021-121438-0024 UNLESS SAID MORDAUNT
3021-121438-0025 THIS SKIFF MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOU FOR PERSONAL PROJECTS OH MY LORD MY LORD THAT TITLE SAID CROMWELL LAUGHING IS ALL VERY WELL HERE

3021-121438-0029 THEN YOU HAD BETTER COME WITH ME THANK YOU SIR BUT THE WAY BY THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WOULD TAKE TOO MUCH TIME AND I HAVE NONE TO LOSE
3021-121438-0030 IT CLOSED AFTER HIM WITH A SPRING THIS DOOR COMMUNICATED WITH A SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE LEADING UNDER THE STREET TO A GROTTO IN THE GARDEN OF A HOUSE ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM THAT OF THE FUTURE PROTECTOR IT WAS JUST BEFORE THIS THAT GRIMAUD HAD PERCEIVED THE TWO MEN SEATED TOGETHER
3021-121438-0031 D'ARTAGNAN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE MORDAUNT HE CRIED AH BY HEAVEN

3021-121438-0038 AND CLAP THEIR HANDS IF THEY CATCH HIM WE WILL DO THE SAME THE NEXT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED AND MORDAUNT APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD FACE TO FACE WITH D'ARTAGNAN
3021-121438-0039 MORDAUNT WAS LIVID BUT HE UTTERED NO CRY NOR CALLED FOR ASSISTANCE D'ARTAGNAN QUIETLY PUSHED HIM IN AGAIN AND BY THE LIGHT OF A LAMP ON THE STAIRCASE MADE HIM ASCEND THE STEPS BACKWARD ONE BY ONE KEEPING HIS EYES ALL THE TIME ON MORDAUNT'S HANDS WHO HOWEVER KNOWING THAT IT WAS USELESS ATTEMPTED NO RESISTANCE
3021-121438-0040 PORTHOS CAME UP BEHIND AND UNHOOKING THE LAMP ON THE STAIRCASE RELIT THAT IN THE ROOM
