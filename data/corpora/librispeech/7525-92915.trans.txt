7525-92915-0000 NOTABLY IN THE CITY OF MECCA WHERE THERE ALSO REMAINED A TEMPLE BUILT IN THE TIME OF THE OLDER RELIGION THAT THE ARABS STILL HELD TO BE SACRED AS THE ARABIAN TRIBES WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER IN MANY WAYS
7525-92915-0001 IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT THEIR RELIGION SHOULD GROW DIFFERENT ALSO SOME MEN WORSHIPPED THE FIRE AND SOME WORSHIPPED THE STARS SOME BECAME JEWS OR CHRISTIANS
7525-92915-0002 AND MANY WISE MEN PREACHED AND LABORED AMONG THEM IN VAIN TO BRING BACK THE OLD RELIGION OF THEIR FATHERS SUCH WAS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WHEN A CHILD WAS BORN IN THE CITY OF MECCA WHO WAS DESTINED TO BECOME ONE OF THE GREATEST PROPHETS OF THE WORLD
7525-92915-0003 AND DRAW ALL THE ARABS INTO A SINGLE RELIGION THAT WOULD SPREAD AS FAR AS SPAIN AND INDIA THIS CHILD WAS NAMED MOHAMMED AND HE WAS BORN FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF CHRIST
7525-92915-0004 HIS FATHER ABDALLAH DIED SOON AFTER HE WAS BORN AND MOHAMMED'S MOTHER ACCORDING TO CUSTOM GAVE THE BABY INTO THE CHARGE OF A NURSE WHO MIGHT REAR HIM IN THE FREE OPEN AIR OF THE DESERT WHERE ARABS BELIEVED THAT CHILDREN BECAME STRONG AND VIGOROUS
7525-92915-0005 MOHAMMED WAS STRONG IN MANY WAYS BUT HAD ONE GREAT PHYSICAL FAILING HE WAS OFTEN SEIZED WITH FITS OF A KIND THAT NOWADAYS WOULD BE ASCRIBED TO THE DISEASE CALLED EPILEPSY IN THOSE DAYS HOWEVER THESE FITS WERE THOUGHT TO BE THE WORK OF DEVILS
7525-92915-0006 WHO ENTERED INTO AND POSSESSED THE BODY WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD HIS MOTHER DIED AND HE WAS BROUGHT UP BY HIS GRANDFATHER ABD AL MUTTALIB A POOR MAN BUT ONE WHO WAS GREATLY RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY THAT KNEW HIM
7525-92915-0007 ABD AL MUTTALIB PUT HIM TO WORK WHEN HE GREW OLD ENOUGH HE WATCHED THE FLOCKS OF THE PEOPLE OF MECCA AND GAINED A MEAGER LIVELIHOOD BY DOING THIS HE HAD NO SCHOOLING BUT ONCE OR TWICE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL
7525-92915-0008 WHERE HE SAW PEOPLE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF MECCA AND LEARNED OF MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF RELIGION WHEN MOHAMMED WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD THERE BEFELL A CHANGE IN HIS FORTUNES IN THIS YEAR HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF A RICH WIDOW WHOSE NAME WAS KADIJAH
7525-92915-0009 AND WENT WITH HER TO THE GREAT FAIRS AND BAZAARS ON WHICH JOURNEYS PERHAPS HE ACTED AS HER CAMEL DRIVER KADIJAH SOON FELL IN LOVE WITH THE YOUNG MAN OF BRIGHT PIERCING EYES AND THOUGHTFUL DEMEANOR
7525-92915-0010 AND ONE DAY SHE DREW MOHAMMED ASIDE AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE LOVED HIM OFFERING TO BECOME HIS WIFE AND TO GIVE HIM HER HAND IN MARRIAGE BY MARRYING KADIJAH MOHAMMED BECAME RICH HE MANAGED HIS WIFE'S AFFAIRS AT MECCA WITH GREAT SUCCESS
7525-92915-0011 AND BECAME GREATLY RESPECTED THERE AS A MAN OF BUSINESS HE AND KADIJAH HAD SIX CHILDREN FOUR GIRLS AND TWO BOYS BUT BOTH OF THE BOYS DIED IN THEIR INFANCY BUT MOHAMMED WAS SOON MARKED AS BEING DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN
7525-92915-0012 HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME IN RELIGIOUS CONTEMPLATION AND WOULD GO OFF BY HIMSELF INTO THE SOLITUDE OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THINK AND PONDER WITHOUT INTERRUPTION WHEN HE WAS FORTY YEARS OLD HE WENT ONE DAY TO A MOUNTAIN CALLED HIRA WHICH WAS NOT FAR FROM MECCA
7525-92915-0013 AND HERE A TRANCE CAME UPON HIM AND IN THE NIGHT HE BELIEVED THAT HE SAW THE ANGEL GABRIEL
7525-92915-0014 AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD A SCROLL OF FIRE FROM WHICH HE COMMANDED MOHAMMED TO READ NOW MOHAMMED KNEW NOT HOW TO READ OR WRITE BUT TO HIS AMAZEMENT HE FOUND THAT THE WORDS ON THE SCROLL WERE QUITE PLAIN TO HIM
7525-92915-0015 AND HE READ A WONDERFUL MESSAGE THAT PROCLAIMED THE GLORY AND THE GREATNESS OF GOD WHOM HE CALLED ALLAH MOHAMMED WAS FRIGHTENED BY WHAT HE HAD SEEN HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE FORM OF THE ANGEL HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SOME EVIL SPIRIT
7525-92915-0016 BUT AT LAST HE HAD ANOTHER VISION IN WHICH GABRIEL CAME TO HIM AGAIN AND CALLED UPON HIM TO ARISE AND PREACH THE WORD OF ALLAH THROUGHOUT THE LAND AND BRING BACK TO THE ARABS THE FAITH OF THEIR FATHERS AND THE WORSHIP OF A SINGLE GOD
7525-92915-0017 AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME MOHAMMED BELIEVED HIS VISIONS AND THOUGHT HIMSELF GOD'S PROPHET AND HE CALLED THE NEW FAITH THAT HE WAS TO TEACH THE FAITH OF ISLAM WHICH MEANS RIGHTEOUSNESS
7525-92915-0018 MOHAMMED WENT BACK TO KADIJAH AND TOLD HER WHAT HE HAD SEEN HE SAID HE WAS CHOSEN BY ALLAH TO SPREAD HIS FAITH OVER THE LAND AND HE HIMSELF WAS A PROPHET GREATER THAN ANY OTHER IN THE WORLD
7525-92915-0019 SHE BELIEVED THAT HE SPOKE THE TRUTH AND LOOKED UPON HIM AS SOME ONE WHO THROUGH GOD'S MEANS HAD BECOME MORE THAN A MAN
7525-92915-0020 BUT CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH TEACHING THE WORD OF ALLAH TO HIS NEAREST RELATIVES MOST OF THEM BELIEVED IN HIM BUT ONE OF HIS UNCLES CALLED HIM A FOOL AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW RELIGION AFTER FOUR YEARS OF TEACHING MOHAMMED HAD ONLY CONVERTED TO THE NEW BELIEF FORTY PEOPLE
7525-92915-0021 WHO WERE MOSTLY MEN OF LOW DEGREE OR SLAVES HE THEN THOUGHT THAT ALLAH CALLED UPON HIM TO GO FORTH PUBLICLY AND PREACH HIS NEW BELIEF TO THE ENTIRE WORLD AND SOON AFTERWARD MOHAMMED COULD HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE MARKET PLACE PREACHING THE WORD OF ALLAH
7525-92915-0022 THE FAITH THAT MOHAMMED TAUGHT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE THE FAITH THAT WE OURSELVES BELIEVE IN THAT IS IT WAS MUCH MORE LIKE THE RELIGION OF CHRIST THAN THE WORSHIP OF IDOLS OR THE BELIEF OF THE ROMANS AND GREEKS IN GODS AND GODDESSES OR THE WORSHIP OF FIRE OR THE STARS
7525-92915-0023 MOHAMMED PREACHED THAT THERE WAS ONE GOD ONLY AND THAT THIS GOD WAS GREATER THAN ALL THINGS IF YOU DIED AND HAD LED A RIGHTEOUS LIFE YOU WENT TO PARADISE IF YOU HAD BEEN WICKED YOU WENT TO THE LOWER REGIONS TO UNDERGO ETERNAL PUNISHMENT
7525-92915-0024 AND THERE WERE A GREAT MANY THINGS IN MOHAMMED'S RELIGION THAT ANY ONE WOULD DO WELL TO FOLLOW FOR HE PREACHED THAT GOD WAS MERCIFUL AND HIS PEOPLE ON EARTH MUST BE MERCIFUL ALSO THAT CLEANLINESS WAS NEXT TO GODLINESS
7525-92915-0025 AND THAT ALL HIS FOLLOWERS MUST WASH THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY PRAYED IN MANY WAYS HOWEVER THE MOHAMMEDAN FAITH WAS NOT SO PURE AS THE CHRISTIAN FAITH FOR THE HEAVEN THAT MOHAMMED BELIEVED IN WAS A PLACE OF FEASTING AND MERRIMENT BUT LITTLE ELSE
7525-92915-0026 AND MOHAMMED ALSO BELIEVED THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO TEACH HIS RELIGION BY THE SWORD IN THIS HOWEVER MOHAMMED'S FOLLOWERS BECAME MORE ZEALOUS THAN HE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF BEING
7525-92915-0027 AND WE MUST REMEMBER ALSO THAT CHRISTIANS OF THOSE DAYS DID NOT HESITATE TO USE THE SWORD THEMSELVES TO SPREAD THE FAITH MOHAMMED SET ABOUT PREPARING A GREAT BOOK WHICH WAS TO BE THE BIBLE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVED IN HIS RELIGION THIS BOOK
7525-92915-0028 WAS CALLED THE KORAN BECAUSE MOHAMMED COULD NOT WRITE AND STILL PRODUCED THIS MARVELOUS BOOK WHICH CONTAINED THE WORD OF ALLAH HE CLAIMED THAT HE WAS DIVINELY INSPIRED IT IS THOUGHT HOWEVER
7525-92915-0029 THAT HE WAS HELPED IN PREPARING THE KORAN BY ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES WHO COULD READ AND WRITE WHEN MOHAMMED PREPARED THE KORAN THERE WAS NO PAPER AND WRITING MATERIALS WERE FAR REMOVED FROM THE ARABS WHO MADE LITTLE USE OF THEM
7525-92915-0030 SO MOHAMMED WAS COMPELLED AS WE ARE TOLD TO WRITE THE KORAN ON ANY MATERIAL THAT CAME TO HAND HE WROTE IT ON PIECES OF STONE AND STRIPS OF LEATHER AND ON DRIED PALM LEAVES AND SOME OF THE VERSES WERE EVEN WRITTEN ON THE BLEACHED SHOULDER BLADES OF SHEEP
7525-92915-0031 ANYTHING THAT COULD HOLD A MARK WAS USED BY HIM AS WRITING MATERIAL AND THE VERSES WERE LATER COLLECTED AND MADE INTO A BOOK BY HIS DISCIPLES WHEN MOHAMMED COMMENCED TO PREACH BEFORE THE PEOPLE THE CITIZENS OF MECCA LOOKED ON HIM AS A MADMAN
7525-92915-0032 THEY DID NOT MOLEST HIM HOWEVER BECAUSE THEY HELD HIM TO BE A WORTHLESS DREAMER WHO COULD DO NO HARM TO ANYBODY BUT AS WEEKS WENT BY AND THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO BECAME CONVERTED TO HIS FAITH GREW LARGER
7525-92915-0033 THEY WERE TOO COWARDLY TO MOLEST MOHAMMED BECAUSE HE WAS A RICH MAN AND WAS PROTECTED BY HIS UNCLE WHO HAD MUCH INFLUENCE AMONG THEM BUT THEY VENTED THEIR SPITE ON THE HUMBLER PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED HIM AND WHO WERE UNABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
7525-92915-0034 SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE POOR MEN WHO WERE MOHAMMEDANS PARTICULARLY THE SLAVES WERE MADE TO SUFFER DREADFUL TORTURES
7525-92915-0035 AT LAST HOWEVER THE PEOPLE OF MECCA BECAME BOLD ENOUGH TO GO TO MOHAMMED'S UNCLE AND TELL HIM THAT MOHAMMED MUST CEASE PREACHING AGAINST THEIR IDOLS MOHAMMED HOWEVER INDIGNANTLY REFUSED AND WENT ON PREACHING AND HIS UNCLE CONTINUED TO PROTECT HIM
7525-92915-0036 AT LAST MOHAMMED'S ENEMIES BECAME SO AFRAID OF THE SUCCESS HE WAS GAINING THAT THEY DECIDED THEY MUST HAVE HIS LIFE AT ALL COSTS AND A PLOT WAS HATCHED AGAINST HIM HE WAS SAVED BY BEING WARNED OF THIS AND HIDDEN AWAY
7525-92915-0037 FOR HIS FAITHFUL WIFE KADIJAH WHOM HE HAD LOVED DEEPLY AND WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO BELIEVE IN HIM AS A PROPHET DIED AND LEFT HIM INCONSOLABLE HIS UNCLE ALSO DIED AND MOHAMMED LOST HIS PROTECTION
7525-92915-0038 IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS PREACHING TO CERTAIN SPIRITS WHOSE BODIES WERE MADE OF FIRE AND WHO WERE KNOWN TO THE MECCANS AS DJINNS AND THESE SPIRITS LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO WHAT MOHAMMED SAID AND DID HIM REVERENCE
7525-92915-0039 HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS FLED TO YATHRIB AND WERE MADE WELCOME THIS FLIGHT WAS CALLED THE HEGIRA AND THE DATE OF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE MOHAMMEDANS FOR THEIR CALENDAR DATES FROM IT AND FOR THEM IS PRACTICALLY THE BEGINNING OF TIME
7525-92915-0040 IN YATHRIB THE FAITH OF MOHAMMED SPREAD QUICKLY AND HE RECEIVED ATTENTION AND REVERENCE WHEREVER HE WENT AND WHEN HE HAD A LARGE FOLLOWING HE DESIRED TO PUT UP A HOUSE OF PRAYER OR A TEMPLE WHICH HE CALLED A MOSQUE
