7559-96247-0000 WE HAVE NOW COMPLETED THE TWO EXPOSITIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO INSERT THE EXPOSITION OF THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL IN ITSELF TOGETHER WITH THE NECESSITY OF ITS PHENOMENON AND THE EXPOSITION OF ITS LOT IN THE WORLD WHICH REFLECTS ITS OWN NATURE
7559-96247-0001 AND UPON THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IT HAS TO ASSERT OR DENY ITSELF THEREFORE WE CAN NOW PROCEED TO BRING OUT MORE CLEARLY THE NATURE OF THIS ASSERTION AND DENIAL ITSELF
7559-96247-0002 WHICH WAS REFERRED TO AND EXPLAINED IN A MERELY GENERAL WAY ABOVE THIS WE SHALL DO BY EXHIBITING THE CONDUCT IN WHICH ALONE IT FINDS ITS EXPRESSION AND CONSIDERING IT IN ITS INNER SIGNIFICANCE THE ASSERTION OF THE WILL
7559-96247-0003 IS THE CONTINUOUS WILLING ITSELF UNDISTURBED BY ANY KNOWLEDGE AS IT FILLS THE LIFE OF MAN IN GENERAL FOR EVEN THE BODY OF A MAN IS THE OBJECTIVITY OF THE WILL AS IT APPEARS AT THIS GRADE AND IN THIS INDIVIDUAL
7559-96247-0004 AN ELUCIDATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WHOLE AND ITS PARTS IT IS ANOTHER WAY OF EXHIBITING THE SAME THING IN ITSELF OF WHICH THE BODY IS ALREADY THE PHENOMENON THEREFORE INSTEAD OF SAYING ASSERTION OF THE WILL
7559-96247-0005 WE MAY SAY ASSERTION OF THE BODY
7559-96247-0006 IS THE SATISFACTION OF THE WANTS WHICH ARE INSEPARABLE FROM THE EXISTENCE OF THE BODY IN HEALTH THEY ALREADY HAVE THEIR EXPRESSION IN IT AND MAY BE REFERRED TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PROPAGATION OF THE SPECIES
7559-96247-0007 BUT INDIRECTLY THE MOST DIFFERENT KINDS OF MOTIVES OBTAIN IN THIS WAY POWER OVER THE WILL AND BRING ABOUT THE MOST MULTIFARIOUS ACTS OF WILL EACH OF THESE IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE AN INSTANCE OF THE WILL WHICH HERE MANIFESTS ITSELF GENERALLY
7559-96247-0008 WHAT FORM THE MOTIVE MAY HAVE AND IMPART TO IT IS NOT ESSENTIAL THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS THAT SOMETHING IS WILLED IN GENERAL AND THE DEGREE OF INTENSITY WITH WHICH IT IS SO WILLED
7559-96247-0009 AS THE EYE ONLY MANIFESTS ITS POWER OF SEEING IN THE LIGHT THE MOTIVE IN GENERAL STANDS BEFORE THE WILL IN PROTEAN FORMS IT CONSTANTLY PROMISES COMPLETE SATISFACTION THE QUENCHING OF THE THIRST OF WILL
7559-96247-0010 BUT WHENEVER IT IS ATTAINED IT AT ONCE APPEARS IN ANOTHER FORM AND THUS INFLUENCES THE WILL ANEW ALWAYS ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF THE INTENSITY OF THIS WILL AND ITS RELATION TO KNOWLEDGE WHICH ARE REVEALED AS EMPIRICAL CHARACTER
7559-96247-0011 IN THESE VERY EXAMPLES AND INSTANCES FROM THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS A MAN FINDS HIMSELF A WILLING BEING AND AS A RULE HIS KNOWLEDGE REMAINS IN CONSTANT RELATION TO HIS WILL
7559-96247-0012 AND THEN THE MEANS OF ATTAINING THEM NOW HE KNOWS WHAT HE HAS TO DO AND AS A RULE HE DOES NOT STRIVE AFTER OTHER KNOWLEDGE HE MOVES AND ACTS HIS CONSCIOUSNESS KEEPS HIM ALWAYS WORKING DIRECTLY
7559-96247-0013 AND ACTIVELY TOWARDS THE AIMS OF HIS WILL HIS THOUGHT IS CONCERNED WITH THE CHOICE OF MOTIVES SUCH IS LIFE FOR ALMOST ALL MEN THEY WISH THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WISH AND THEY STRIVE AFTER IT
7559-96247-0014 WITH SUFFICIENT SUCCESS TO KEEP THEM FROM DESPAIR AND SUFFICIENT FAILURE TO KEEP THEM FROM ENNUI AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FROM THIS PROCEEDS A CERTAIN SERENITY OR AT LEAST INDIFFERENCE WHICH CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY WEALTH OR POVERTY
7559-96247-0015 FOR THIS AS WE HAVE SHOWN ACTS IN A PURELY NEGATIVE WAY
7559-96247-0016 THEY PRESS FORWARD WITH MUCH EARNESTNESS AND INDEED WITH AN AIR OF IMPORTANCE THUS CHILDREN ALSO PURSUE THEIR PLAY IT IS ALWAYS AN EXCEPTION IF SUCH A LIFE SUFFERS INTERRUPTION FROM THE FACT THAT EITHER THE AESTHETIC DEMAND FOR CONTEMPLATION
7559-96247-0017 OR THE ETHICAL DEMAND FOR RENUNCIATION PROCEED FROM A KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE SERVICE OF THE WILL AND DIRECTED TO THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN GENERAL MOST MEN ARE PURSUED BY WANT ALL THROUGH LIFE
7559-96247-0018 WITHOUT EVER BEING ALLOWED TO COME TO THEIR SENSES ON THE OTHER HAND THE WILL IS OFTEN INFLAMED TO A DEGREE THAT FAR TRANSCENDS THE ASSERTION OF THE BODY AND THEN VIOLENT EMOTIONS AND POWERFUL PASSIONS
7559-96247-0019 SHOW THEMSELVES IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL NOT ONLY ASSERTS HIS OWN EXISTENCE BUT DENIES AND SEEKS TO SUPPRESS THAT OF OTHERS WHEN IT STANDS IN HIS WAY THE MAINTENANCE OF THE BODY THROUGH ITS OWN POWERS
7559-96247-0020 IS SO SMALL A DEGREE OF THE ASSERTION OF WILL THAT IF IT VOLUNTARILY REMAINS AT THIS DEGREE WE MIGHT ASSUME THAT WITH THE DEATH OF THIS BODY THE WILL ALSO WHICH APPEARED IN IT WOULD BE EXTINGUISHED
7559-96247-0021 BUT EVEN THE SATISFACTION OF THE SEXUAL PASSIONS GOES BEYOND THE ASSERTION OF ONE'S OWN EXISTENCE WHICH FILLS SO SHORT A TIME AND ASSERTS LIFE FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME AFTER THE DEATH OF THE INDIVIDUAL
7559-96247-0022 HERE EVEN NAIVE EXHIBITS TO US OPENLY THE INNER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ACT OF GENERATION OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS THE INTENSITY OF THE IMPULSE TEACHES US THAT IN THIS ACT THE MOST DECIDED ASSERTION OF THE WILL TO LIVE EXPRESSES ITSELF
7559-96247-0023 PURE AND WITHOUT FURTHER ADDITION
7559-96247-0024 A NEW LIFE APPEARS IN TIME AND THE CAUSAL SERIES E IN NATURE THE BEGOTTEN APPEARS BEFORE THE BEGETTER DIFFERENT AS REGARDS THE PHENOMENON BUT
7559-96247-0025 ACCORDING TO THE IDEA IDENTICAL WITH HIM THEREFORE IT IS THIS ACT THROUGH WHICH EVERY SPECIES OF LIVING CREATURE BINDS ITSELF TO A WHOLE AND IS PERPETUATED GENERATION IS WITH REFERENCE TO THE BEGETTER
7559-96247-0026 ONLY THE EXPRESSION THE SYMPTOM OF HIS DECIDED ASSERTION OF THE WILL TO LIVE WITH REFERENCE TO THE BEGOTTEN IT IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE WILL WHICH APPEARS IN HIM FOR THE WILL IN ITSELF KNOWS NEITHER CAUSE NOR EFFECT BUT LIKE ALL CAUSES
7559-96247-0027 IT IS MERELY THE OCCASIONAL CAUSE OF THE PHENOMENAL APPEARANCE OF THIS WILL AT THIS TIME IN THIS PLACE AS THING IN ITSELF THE WILL OF THE BEGETTER AND THAT OF THE BEGOTTEN ARE NOT DIFFERENT FOR ONLY THE PHENOMENON NOT THE THING IN ITSELF
7559-96247-0028 SUFFERING AND DEATH AS BELONGING TO THE PHENOMENON OF LIFE HAVE ALSO BEEN ASSERTED ANEW
7559-96247-0029 HAS FOR THIS TIME BEEN SHOWN TO BE FRUITLESS HERE LIES THE PROFOUND REASON OF THE SHAME CONNECTED WITH THE PROCESS OF GENERATION THIS VIEW IS MYTHICALLY EXPRESSED IN THE DOGMA OF CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY
7559-96247-0030 THAT WE ARE ALL PARTAKERS IN ADAM'S FIRST TRANSGRESSION WHICH IS CLEARLY JUST THE SATISFACTION OF SEXUAL PASSION AND THROUGH IT ARE GUILTY OF SUFFERING AND DEATH
7559-96247-0031 IN THIS THEOLOGY GOES BEYOND THE CONSIDERATION OF THINGS ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT REASON AND RECOGNISES THE IDEA OF MAN THE UNITY OF WHICH IS RE ESTABLISHED OUT OF ITS DISPERSION INTO INNUMERABLE INDIVIDUALS
7559-96247-0032 THROUGH THE BOND OF GENERATION WHICH HOLDS THEM ALL TOGETHER ACCORDINGLY IT REGARDS EVERY INDIVIDUAL AS ON ONE SIDE IDENTICAL WITH ADAM THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ASSERTION OF LIFE AND SO FAR AS SUBJECT TO SIN
7559-96247-0033 ORIGINAL SIN SUFFERING AND DEATH ON THE OTHER SIDE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IDEA OF MAN ENABLES IT TO REGARD EVERY INDIVIDUAL AS IDENTICAL WITH THE SAVIOUR THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE AND
7559-96247-0034 SO FAR AS A PARTAKER OF HIS SACRIFICE OF HIMSELF SAVED THROUGH HIS MERITS AND DELIVERED FROM THE BANDS OF SIN AND DEATH E THE WORLD
7559-96247-0035 ANOTHER MYTHICAL EXPOSITION OF OUR VIEW OF SEXUAL PLEASURE AS THE ASSERTION OF THE WILL
7559-96247-0036 OR AS IT WERE A RENEWED ASSIGNMENT OF LIFE
7559-96247-0037 ITS FRUIT BUT WHO BECAME SUBJECT TO IT ALTOGETHER THROUGH EATING THE POMEGRANATE THIS MEANING APPEARS VERY CLEARLY IN GOETHE'S INCOMPARABLE PRESENTATION OF THIS MYTH ESPECIALLY WHEN
7559-96247-0038 SHE HAS TASTED THE POMEGRANATE THE INVISIBLE CHORUS OF THE FATES THOU ART OURS FASTING SHOULDEST THOU RETURN AND THE BITE OF THE APPLE MAKES THEE OURS
7559-96247-0039 EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO THE MAYA OF THE HINDUS WHOSE WORK AND WEB IS THE WHOLE WORLD OF ILLUSION IS ALSO SYMBOLISED BY LOVE THE GENITAL ORGANS ARE FAR MORE THAN
7559-96247-0040 ANY OTHER EXTERNAL MEMBER OF THE BODY SUBJECT MERELY TO THE WILL AND NOT AT ALL TO KNOWLEDGE INDEED THE WILL SHOWS ITSELF HERE ALMOST AS INDEPENDENT
7559-96247-0041 AS IN THOSE PARTS WHICH ACTING MERELY IN CONSEQUENCE OF STIMULI ARE SUBSERVIENT TO VEGETATIVE LIFE AND REPRODUCTION IN WHICH THE WILL WORKS BLINDLY AS IN UNCONSCIOUS NATURE
7559-96247-0042 AT THE SECOND POWER AS DEATH IS ONLY EXCRETION AT THE SECOND POWER ACCORDING TO ALL THIS THE GENITALS ARE PROPERLY THE FOCUS OF WILL AND CONSEQUENTLY THE OPPOSITE POLE OF THE BRAIN
7559-96247-0043 THE FORMER ARE THE LIFE SUSTAINING PRINCIPLE ENSURING ENDLESS LIFE TO TIME IN THIS RESPECT THEY WERE WORSHIPPED BY THE GREEKS IN THE PHALLUS AND BY THE HINDUS IN THE LINGAM WHICH ARE THUS THE SYMBOL OF THE ASSERTION OF THE WILL
7559-96247-0044 KNOWLEDGE ON THE OTHER HAND AFFORDS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE SUPPRESSION OF WILLING OF SALVATION THROUGH FREEDOM
7559-96247-0045 OF CONQUEST AND ANNIHILATION OF THE WORLD WE ALREADY CONSIDERED FULLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FOURTH BOOK HOW THE WILL TO LIVE IN ITS ASSERTION MUST REGARD ITS RELATION TO DEATH WE SAW THAT DEATH DOES NOT TROUBLE IT
7559-96247-0046 BECAUSE IT EXISTS AS SOMETHING INCLUDED IN LIFE ITSELF AND BELONGING TO IT ITS OPPOSITE GENERATION COMPLETELY COUNTERBALANCES IT AND IN SPITE OF THE DEATH
7559-96247-0047 OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENSURES AND GUARANTEES LIFE TO THE WILL TO LIVE THROUGH ALL TIME TO EXPRESS THIS THE HINDUS MADE THE LINGAM AN ATTRIBUTE OF SIVA THE GOD OF DEATH WE ALSO FULLY EXPLAINED THERE HOW
7559-96247-0048 AWAITS DEATH WITHOUT FEAR WE SHALL THEREFORE SAY NOTHING MORE ABOUT THIS HERE WITHOUT CLEAR CONSCIOUSNESS MOST MEN OCCUPY THIS STANDPOINT AND CONTINUALLY ASSERT LIFE THE WORLD EXISTS AS THE MIRROR OF THIS ASSERTION WITH
7559-96247-0049 INNUMERABLE INDIVIDUALS IN INFINITE TIME AND SPACE IN INFINITE SUFFERING BETWEEN GENERATION AND DEATH WITHOUT END
7559-96247-0050 FOR THE WILL CONDUCTS THE GREAT TRAGEDY AND COMEDY AT ITS OWN EXPENSE AND IS ALSO ITS OWN SPECTATOR THE WORLD IS JUST WHAT IT IS BECAUSE THE WILL WHOSE MANIFESTATION IT IS
7559-96247-0051 IN THIS PHENOMENON ALSO THE WILL ASSERTS ITSELF AND THIS ASSERTION IS JUSTIFIED AND BALANCED BY THE FACT THAT THE WILL BEARS THE SUFFERING HERE
7559-96247-0052 WE SHALL RECOGNISE IT LATER MORE DEFINITELY AND DISTINCTLY AND ALSO IN THE PARTICULAR BUT FIRST WE MUST CONSIDER TEMPORAL OR HUMAN JUSTICE
7559-96247-0053 IT MAY BE REMEMBERED FROM THE SECOND BOOK THAT IN THE WHOLE OF NATURE AT ALL THE GRADES OF THE OBJECTIFICATION OF WILL
7559-96247-0054 AND IN THIS WAY WAS EXPRESSED THE INNER CONTRADICTION OF THE WILL TO LIVE WITH ITSELF AT THE HIGHEST GRADE OF THE OBJECTIFICATION THIS PHENOMENON LIKE ALL OTHERS WILL EXHIBIT ITSELF WITH
7559-96247-0055 GREATER DISTINCTNESS AND WILL THEREFORE BE MORE EASILY EXPLAINED WITH THIS AIM WE SHALL NEXT ATTEMPT TO TRACE THE SOURCE OF EGOISM AS THE STARTING POINT OF ALL CONFLICT
7559-96247-0056 POSSIBLE THEY ARE THE ESSENTIAL FORMS OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
7559-96247-0057 KNOWLEDGE SPRINGING FROM THE WILL THEREFORE THE WILL EVERYWHERE MANIFESTS ITSELF IN THE MULTIPLICITY OF INDIVIDUALS BUT THIS MULTIPLICITY DOES NOT CONCERN THE WILL AS THING IN ITSELF BUT ONLY ITS PHENOMENA THE WILL ITSELF IS PRESENT WHOLE AND UNDIVIDED
7559-96247-0058 IN EVERY ONE OF THESE AND BEHOLDS AROUND IT THE INNUMERABLY REPEATED IMAGE OF ITS OWN NATURE BUT THIS NATURE ITSELF THE ACTUALLY REAL IT FINDS DIRECTLY ONLY IN ITS INNER SELF THEREFORE EVERY
7559-96247-0059 IT IS ONLY CONSCIOUS OF THEM AS ITS IDEA THUS MERELY INDIRECTLY AS SOMETHING WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON ITS OWN NATURE AND EXISTENCE
7559-96247-0060 AND INDISTINGUISHABLE EVERY KNOWING INDIVIDUAL
7559-96247-0061 AS A MICROCOSM WHICH IS OF EQUAL VALUE WITH THE MACROCOSM NATURE ITSELF WHICH IS EVERYWHERE AND ALWAYS TRUTHFUL GIVES HIM THIS KNOWLEDGE ORIGINALLY
7559-96247-0062 NOW FROM THESE TWO NECESSARY PROPERTIES WE HAVE GIVEN THE FACT MAY BE EXPLAINED THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL THOUGH VANISHING ALTOGETHER AND DIMINISHED TO NOTHING IN THE
7559-96247-0063 YET MAKES ITSELF THE CENTRE OF THE WORLD HAS REGARD FOR ITS OWN EXISTENCE AND WELL BEING BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE INDEED FROM THE NATURAL STANDPOINT IS READY TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THIS
7559-96247-0064 THAT THE INNER CONFLICT OF THE WILL WITH ITSELF ATTAINS TO SUCH A TERRIBLE REVELATION
7559-96247-0065 AND BEING IN THAT OPPOSITION OF THE MICROCOSM AND MACROCOSM OR IN THE FACT THAT THE OBJECTIFICATION OF WILL
7559-96247-0066 INDIVIDUAL IS GIVEN TO ITSELF DIRECTLY AS THE WHOLE WILL AND THE WHOLE SUBJECT OF IDEAS OTHER INDIVIDUALS ARE ONLY GIVEN IT AS IDEAS THEREFORE ITS OWN BEING AND THE MAINTENANCE OF IT
7559-96247-0067 IS OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO IT THAN THAT OF ALL OTHERS TOGETHER EVERY ONE LOOKS UPON HIS OWN DEATH AS UPON THE END OF THE WORLD
7559-96247-0068 AS A MATTER OF COMPARATIVE INDIFFERENCE
7559-96247-0069 GRADE ALSO AND THE CONFLICT OF INDIVIDUALS WHICH IS CONDITIONED BY IT MUST APPEAR IN ITS MOST TERRIBLE FORM AND INDEED WE SEE THIS EVERYWHERE BEFORE OUR EYES IN SMALL THINGS AS IN GREAT
7559-96247-0070 NOW ITS ABSURD SIDE IN WHICH IT IS THE THEME OF COMEDY AND VERY SPECIALLY APPEARS AS SELF CONCEIT AND VANITY
7559-96247-0071 UNDERSTOOD THIS BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE AND PRESENTED IT IN THE ABSTRACT
7559-96247-0072 IN OUR OWN EXPERIENCE BUT IT APPEARS MOST DISTINCTLY OF ALL WHEN ANY MOB OF MEN IS SET FREE FROM ALL LAW AND ORDER
7559-96247-0073 HAS SO ADMIRABLY DESCRIBED IN THE
7559-96247-0074 WE SEE NOT ONLY
7559-96247-0075 FROM THE OTHER WHAT HE WANTS HIMSELF BUT HOW OFTEN ONE WILL DESTROY THE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE OF ANOTHER FOR THE SAKE OF AN INSIGNIFICANT ADDITION TO HIS OWN HAPPINESS THIS IS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF EGOISM
7559-96247-0076 THE MANIFESTATIONS OF WHICH IN THIS REGARD ARE ONLY SURPASSED BY THOSE OF ACTUAL WICKEDNESS WHICH SEEKS QUITE DISINTERESTEDLY
