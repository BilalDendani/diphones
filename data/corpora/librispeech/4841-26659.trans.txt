4841-26659-0000 THE LOOM SHED WAS ONE OF THE LOG CABINS CONNECTED WITH THE MAIN BUILDING BY A ROOFED PASSAGE
4841-26659-0001 GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF A SMALL FLOCK OF CABINS ALL NESTLING UNDER THE WINGS OF THE OLD BUILDING IN THE CENTRE THE SHED WAS DARK HAVING BUT ONE SMALL WINDOW WITH GLASS PANES NEAR THE LOOM THE OTHER AND LARGER OPENING BEING TIGHTLY CLOSED BY A WOODEN SHUTTER
4841-26659-0002 DAVID SLEPT LATE AND AWOKE AT LAST TO FIND HIMSELF THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM HIS DREAMS IN THIS UNIQUE ROOM ALL IN THE DEEPEST SHADOW EXCEPT FOR THE ONE WARM BAR OF SUNLIGHT WHICH FELL ACROSS HIS FACE
4841-26659-0003 HE DROWSED OFF AGAIN AND HIS MIND BEGAN PIECING TOGETHER FRAGMENTS AND SCENES FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY AND EVENING AND IMMEDIATELY HE WAS SURROUNDED BY MYSTERY MOONLIT FAIRYLIKE AND WHITE A LITTLE CROOKED BEING AT HIS SIDE LOOKING UP AT HIM LIKE SOME GNOME CREATURE OF THE HILLS
4841-26659-0004 REVEALED AS A PART OF THE ENCHANTMENT THEN SLOWLY RESOLVING AND MELTING AWAY AFTER THE MANNER OF DREAMS THE WIDE SPACES OF THE MYSTERY DREW CLOSER AND WARMER AND A GREAT CENTRE OF BLAZING LOGS THREW GROTESQUE DANCING LIGHTS AMONG THEM
4841-26659-0005 AND AN OLD FACE PEERED OUT WITH BRIGHT KEEN EYES NOW SEEN NOW LOST IN THE FITFUL SHADOWS NOW PALE AND APPEALING OR CAUTIOUSLY WITHDRAWN BUT ALWAYS WATCHING WATCHING WHILE THE LITTLE CROOKED BEING CAME AND WATCHED ALSO
4841-26659-0006 THEN BETWEEN HIM AND THE BLAZING LIGHT CAME A DARK FIGURE SILHOUETTED BLACKLY AGAINST IT MOVING STOOPING RISING GOING AND COMING A SWEET GIRL'S HEAD WITH HEAVILY COILED HAIR THROUGH WHICH THE FIRELIGHT PLAYED WITH FLASHES OF ITS OWN COLOR
4841-26659-0007 AND A DELICATE PROFILE CUT IN PURE CLEAN LINES MELTING INTO THROAT AND GENTLY ROUNDED BREAST LIKE A SPIRIT NOW HERE NOW GONE AGAIN NEAR AND BENDING OVER HIM A MINISTERING SPIRIT BRINGING HIM FOOD
4841-26659-0008 UNTIL GRADUALLY THIS HALF WAKE DREAMING REMINISCENCE CONCENTRATED UPON HER AND AGAIN HE SAW HER STANDING HOLDING THE CANDLE HIGH AND LOOKING UP AT HIM A WONDERING QUESTIONING SPIRIT THEN DROOPING WEARILY INTO THE CHAIR BY THE UNCLEARED TABLE
4841-26659-0009 AND AGAIN WAITING WITH ALMOST A SMILE ON HER PARTED LIPS AS HE SAID GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT AH YES IT WAS MORNING
4841-26659-0010 AGAIN HE HEARD THE CONTINUOUS RUSHING NOISE TO WHICH HE HAD LISTENED IN THE WHITE MYSTERY THAT HAD SOOTHED HIM TO SLUMBER THE NIGHT BEFORE RISING AND FALLING NEVER CEASING HE ROUSED HIMSELF WITH SUDDEN ENERGY AND BOUNDED FROM HIS COUCH HE WOULD GO OUT AND INVESTIGATE
4841-26659-0011 WHEN HE THREW OPEN THE SHUTTER OF THE LARGE UNGLAZED WINDOW SPACE AND LOOKED OUT ON HIS STRANGE SURROUNDINGS HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A NEW WORLD SPARKLING FRESH CLEAR SHINING WITH SUNLIGHT AND GLISTENING WITH WETNESS
4841-26659-0012 AS THOUGH THE WHOLE EARTH HAD BEEN NEWLY WASHED AND VARNISHED
4841-26659-0013 HE HAD BEEN TOO EXHAUSTED THE PREVIOUS EVENING TO DO MORE THAN FALL INTO THE BED WHICH HAD BEEN PROVIDED HIM AND SLEEP HIS LONG UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP
4841-26659-0014 THE LOOM SHED FOR BETWEEN THE TWO WINDOWS STOOD A CLOTH LOOM LEFT JUST AS IT HAD BEEN USED THE WARP LIKE A TIGHTLY STRETCHED VEIL OF WHITE THREADS AND THE WEB OF CLOTH BEGUN IN ONE CORNER WERE A FEW BUNDLES OF COTTON
4841-26659-0015 ONE OF WHICH HAD BEEN TORN OPEN AND THE CONTENTS PLACED IN A THICK LAYER OVER THE LONG BENCH ON WHICH HE HAD SLEPT AND COVERED WITH A BLUE AND WHITE HOMESPUN COUNTERPANE THE HEAD HAD BEEN BUILT HIGH WITH IT AND SHEETS SPREAD OVER ALL
4841-26659-0016 HE NOTICED THE BLANKETS WHICH HAD COVERED HIM AND SAW THAT THEY WERE EVIDENTLY OF HOME MANUFACTURE AND THAT THE WHITE SPREAD WHICH COVERED THEM WAS ALSO OF COARSE CLEAN HOMESPUN ORNAMENTED IN SQUARES WITH RUDE PRIMITIVE NEEDLEWORK HE MARVELLED AT THE INDUSTRY HERE REPRESENTED
4841-26659-0017 AS FOR HIS TOILET THE PREPARATION HAD BEEN MOST SIMPLE A SHELF PLACED ON PEGS DRIVEN BETWEEN THE LOGS SUPPORTED A PIECE OF LOOKING GLASS
4841-26659-0018 OVER WHICH HUNG A DIPPER OF GOURD A WHITE PORCELAIN BASIN WAS PLACED ON THE CHAIR OVER WHICH A CLEAN TOWEL HAD BEEN SPREAD AND TO COMPLETE ALL A SQUARE CUT FROM THE END OF A BAR OF YELLOW SOAP LAY BESIDE THE BASIN
4841-26659-0019 DAVID SMILED AS HE BENT HIMSELF TO THE REFRESHING TASK OF BATHING IN WATER SO COLD AS TO BE REALLY ICY INDEED ICE HAD FORMED OVER STILL POOLS WITHOUT DURING THE NIGHT ALTHOUGH NOW FAST DISAPPEARING UNDER THE GLOWING MORNING SUN
4841-26659-0020 ABOVE HIS HEAD LAID UPON CROSS BEAMS WERE BUNDLES OF WOOL UNCARDED AND CARDING BOARDS HUNG FROM NAILS IN THE LOGS IN ONE CORNER WAS A RUDELY CONSTRUCTED REEL AND FROM THE LOOM DANGLED THE IDLE SHUTTLE FILLED WITH FINE BLUE YARN OF WOOL
4841-26659-0021 THRYNG THOUGHT OF THE WORN OLD HANDS WHICH HAD SO OFTEN THROWN IT
4841-26659-0022 THAT HE MIGHT GO IN AND DO WHAT HE COULD TO HELP THE PATIENT IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH RETURN FOR THE KINDNESS SHOWN HIM HE FEARED TO OFFER MONEY FOR HIS LODGMENT AT LEAST UNTIL HE COULD FIND A WAY AT LAST FULL OF NEW VIGOR AND VERY HUNGRY
4841-26659-0023 HE ISSUED FROM HIS SLEEPING ROOM SADLY IN NEED OF A SHAVE BUT BIDING HIS TIME SATISFIED IF ONLY BREAKFAST MIGHT BE FORTHCOMING HE HAD NO NEED TO KNOCK FOR THE HOUSE DOOR STOOD OPEN FLOODING THE PLACE WITH SUNLIGHT AND FROSTY AIR
4841-26659-0024 THE HUGE PILE OF LOGS WAS BLAZING ON THE HEARTH AS IF IT HAD NEVER CEASED SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE FLAMES LEAPED HOT AND RED UP THE GREAT CHIMNEY OLD SALLY NO LONGER PRESIDED AT THE COOKERY
4841-26659-0025 WITH A LARGE CUP OF BLACK COFFEE BEFORE HER SHE NOW SAT AT THE TABLE EATING CORN BREAD AND BACON A DROOPING BLACK SUNBONNET ON HER HEAD COVERED HER UNKEMPT GRIZZLY HAIR AND A COB PIPE AND BAG OF TOBACCO LAY AT HER HAND SHE WAS READY FOR DEPARTURE
4841-26659-0026 CASSANDRA HAD RETURNED AND HER GRATUITOUS NEIGHBORLY OFFICES WERE AT AN END THE GIRL WAS STOOPING BEFORE THE FIRE ARRANGING A CAKE OF CORN BREAD TO COOK IN THE ASHES A CRANE SWUNG OVER THE FLAMES ON WHICH A FAT IRON KETTLE WAS HUNG
4841-26659-0027 AND THE LARGE COFFEE POT STOOD ON THE HEARTH THE ODOR OF BREAKFAST WAS SAVORY AND APPETIZING AS DAVID'S TALL FORM CAST A SHADOW ACROSS THE SUNLIT SPACE ON THE FLOOR THE OLD MOTHER'S VOICE CALLED TO HIM FROM THE CORNER
4841-26659-0028 TAKE A CHEER AND SET YOUR BREAKFAST'S READY I RECKON HOW HAVE YOU SLEPT SUH THE GIRL AT THE FIRE ROSE AND GREETED HIM BUT HE MISSED THE BOY WHERE'S THE LITTLE CHAP HE ASKED

4841-26659-0032 THEN YOU MUST HAVE BEEN GLAD TO HAVE SNOW YESTERDAY I WAS DISAPPOINTED I WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW THRYNG'S BREAKFAST WAS SERVED TO HIM AS HAD BEEN HIS SUPPER OF THE EVENING BEFORE DIRECTLY FROM THE FIRE
4841-26659-0033 AS HE ATE HE LOOKED OUT UPON THE USUAL LITTER OF CORN FODDER SCATTERED ABOUT NEAR THE HOUSE AND A FEW IMPLEMENTS OF THE SIMPLEST CHARACTER FOR CULTIVATING THE SMALL POCKET OF RICH SOIL BELOW BUT BEYOND THIS AND SURROUNDING IT WAS A SCENE OF THE WILDEST BEAUTY
4841-26659-0034 GIANT FOREST TREES INTERTWINED AND ALMOST OVERGROWN BY A TANGLE OF WILD GRAPEVINES HID THE FALL FROM SIGHT AND BEHIND THEM THE MOUNTAIN ROSE ABRUPTLY A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF CLEAREST WATER ICY COLD
4841-26659-0035 FELL FROM HIGH ABOVE INTO A LONG TROUGH MADE OF A HOLLOW LOG THERE AT THE RUNNING WATER STOOD LITTLE HOYLE
4841-26659-0036 IN A MOMENT HE CAME IN PANTING SHIVERING AND SHINING AND STILL WET ABOUT THE HAIR AND EARS
4841-26659-0037 SHE TOOK THE TOWEL FROM HIM AND GAVE HIS HEAD A VIGOROUS RUBBING
4841-26659-0038 SHE TURNED TO DAVID LIKELY YOU TAKE MILK IN YOUR COFFEE I NEVER THOUGHT TO ASK YOU SHE LEFT THE ROOM AND RETURNED WITH A CUP OF NEW MILK WARM AND SWEET HE WAS GLAD TO GET IT FINDING HIS BLACK COFFEE SWEETENED ONLY WITH MOLASSES UNPALATABLE
4841-26659-0039 DON'T YOU TAKE MILK IN YOUR COFFEE HOW CAME YOU TO THINK OF IT FOR ME I KNEW A LADY AT THE HOTEL LAST SUMMER
4841-26659-0040 HIT'S CLAR WASTE TO MY THINKIN CASSANDRA SMILED THAT'S BECAUSE YOU NEVER COULD ABIDE MILK MOTHAH THINKS IT'S ONLY FIT TO MAKE BUTTAH AND RAISE PIGS ON OLD SALLY'S HORSE A THIN WIRY BEAST GRAY AND SPECKLED
4841-26659-0041 HIS BRIDLE HANGING FROM HIS NECK THE BIT DANGLING WHILE HE ALSO MADE HIS REPAST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS CORN AND SHE HAD FINISHED HER ELABORATE FAREWELLS AT THE BEDSIDE AND LITTLE HOYLE HAD WITH MUCH EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN BRIDLING HER STEED
4841-26659-0042 SHE STEPPED QUICKLY OUT AND GAINED HER SEAT ON THE HIGH NARROW SADDLE WITH THE EASE OF A YOUNG GIRL MEAGRE AS A WILLOW WITHE IN HER SCANT BLACK COTTON GOWN PERCHED ON HER BONY GRAY BEAST
4841-26659-0043 AND ONLY THE BOWL OF HER COB PIPE PROJECTING BEYOND THE RIM OF HER SUNBONNET AS INDICATION THAT A FACE MIGHT BE HIDDEN IN ITS DEPTHS WITH A MEAL SACK CONTAINING IN EITHER END SUNDRY GIFTS SALT PORK CHICKEN CORN BREAD AND MEAL
4841-26659-0044 SLUNG OVER THE HORSE'S BACK BEHIND HER AND WITH CONTENTMENT IN HER HEART
4841-26659-0045 MERELY A MULE TRACK ARCHED WITH HORNBEAM AND DOGWOOD AND MULBERRY TREES AND TOWERED OVER BY GIANT CHESTNUTS AND OAKS AND GREAT WHITE PINES AND DEEP GREEN HEMLOCKS THROUGH MYRIAD LEAFLESS BRANCHES THE WIND SOUGHED PLEASANTLY OVERHEAD
4841-26659-0046 UNFELT BY HER SO COMPLETELY WAS SHE PROTECTED BY THE THICKLY GROWING LAUREL AND RHODODENDRON ON EITHER SIDE OF HER PATH THE SNOW OF THE DAY BEFORE WAS GONE LEAVING ONLY THE GLISTENING WETNESS OF IT ON STONES AND FALLEN LEAVES AND TWIGS UNDERFOOT
4841-26659-0047 WHILE IN OPEN SPACES THE SUN BEAT WARMLY DOWN UPON HER THE TRAIL LED BY MANY STEEP SCRAMBLES AND SHARP DESCENTS MORE DIRECTLY TO HER HOME THAN THE ROAD WHICH WOUND AND TURNED SO FREQUENTLY AS TO MORE THAN DOUBLE THE DISTANCE
4841-26659-0048 THEN BREAKING OFF A BIT OF THE ROOT SHE CHEWED IT WHILE SHE THRUST THE REST IN HER BAG AND USED THE TOP FOR A SWITCH WITH WHICH TO HASTEN THE PACE OF HER NAG THE SMALL STONES LOOSENED WHEN SHE TORE THE SHRUB FROM THE BANK RATTLED DOWN WHERE THE SOIL HAD BEEN WASHED AWAY
4841-26659-0049 LEAVING THE STEEP SHELVING ROCK SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN BARE AND SHE HEARD THEM LEAP THE SMOOTH SPACE AND FALL SOFTLY ON THE MOSS AMONG THE FERNS AND LODGED LEAVES BELOW THERE CROUCHED IN THE SUN LAY A MAN WITH A BLACK FELT HAT COVERING HIS FACE
4841-26659-0050 THE STONES FALLING ABOUT HIM CAUSED HIM TO RAISE HIMSELF STEALTHILY AND PEER UPWARD DESCRYING ONLY THE LONE WOMAN AND THE GRAY HORSE HE GAVE A LOW PECULIAR CRY ALMOST LIKE THAT OF AN ANIMAL IN DISTRESS SHE DREW REIN SHARPLY AND LISTENED
4841-26659-0051 THE CRY WAS REPEATED A LITTLE LOUDER
4841-26659-0052 HE CLIMBED RAPIDLY UP THROUGH THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND STOOD AT HER SIDE BREATHING QUICKLY FOR A MOMENT THEY WAITED THUS REGARDING EACH OTHER NEITHER SPEAKING THE BOY HE SEEMED LITTLE MORE THAN A YOUTH
4841-26659-0053 LOOKED UP AT HER WITH A SINGULARLY INNOCENT AND APPEALING EXPRESSION BUT GRADUALLY AS HE SAW HER IMPASSIVE AND UNRELENTING FACE HIS OWN RESUMED A HARD AND SULLEN LOOK WHICH MADE HIM APPEAR YEARS OLDER HIS FOREHEAD WAS DAMP AND COLD
4841-26659-0054 AND A LOCK OF SILKEN BLACK HAIR SLIGHTLY CURLING OVER IT INCREASED ITS WHITENESS DARK HEAVY RINGS WERE UNDER HIS EYES WHICH GLEAMED BLUE AS THE SKY BETWEEN LONG DARK LASHES HIS ARMS DROPPED LISTLESSLY AT HIS SIDE
4841-26659-0055 AND HE STOOD BEFORE HER AS BEFORE A DREAD JUDGE BAREHEADED AND SILENT HE BORE HER LOOK ONLY FOR A MINUTE THEN DROPPED HIS EYES AND HIS HAND CLINCHED MORE TIGHTLY THE RIM OF HIS OLD FELT HAT WHEN HE CEASED LOOKING AT HER HER EYES SOFTENED
