7000-83708-0000 CHAPTER THREE AND BATS OUR INNINGS WAS OVER FOR THIRTEEN RUNS WE SAT THERE MOPING IN A CROWD I AMONG THE REST WHEN MISTER BENYON BUSTLING UP
7000-83708-0001 REMINDED ME OF MY DUTIES AS A CAPTAIN NOW THEN TURN OUT SEND YOUR MEN INTO THE FIELD WE CAN'T STOP HERE ALL DAY I'M FIRST MAN IN
7000-83708-0002 WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER ONE PART OF HIS ADDRESS GAVE US A CERTAIN GRATIFICATION THAT PART IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE SOON WOULD HAVE TO GO WE TURNED OUT
7000-83708-0003 I SUPPOSE A MORE UNPROMISING SET OF FIELDSMEN NEVER YET TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE FIELD THE LATCHMERE MEN WENT SLOUCHING TOWARDS THE TENT SOME OF THEM I NOTICED INSTEAD OF GOING IN STOLE TOWARDS THE REAR
7000-83708-0004 I NEVER SET EYES ON THEM AGAIN MISTER TRENTHAM I I CAN'T BOWL WHISPERED MISTER SAPSWORTH TO ME AS WE MOVED ACROSS THE TURF HE AND I HAD AGREED THAT WE SHOULD START THE BOWLING
7000-83708-0005 BUT MISTER BENYON INTERVENED NOW BOB SAPSWORTH YOU TAKE THE BOWLING ONE END AND LET YOUR CAPTAIN TAKE THE OTHER CAPTAIN YOU TAKE FIRST OVER I OBEYED WITHOUT A MURMUR
7000-83708-0006 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUITE A USUAL THING TO SEE IN A MATCH A MEMBER OF ONE TEAM ORDERING ABOUT THE CAPTAIN OF THE OTHER I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR FIELD WAS ARRANGED ON SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES I MAY CERTAINLY CLAIM THAT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ITS ARRANGEMENT
7000-83708-0007 THERE IS A SUSPICION FLOATING THROUGH MY MIND THAT AT ONE OR TWO POINTS TWO OR MORE MEN WERE PLACED UNUSUALLY CLOSE TOGETHER FOR INSTANCE AT DEEP MID OFF VERY DEEP MID OFF
7000-83708-0008 MISTER HAWTHORN AND MISTER HEDGES WERE NOT ONLY DOING THEIR BEST TO TRAMPLE ON EACH OTHER'S TOES BUT EACH WAS SEEKING FOR A PLACE OF SECURITY BEHIND THE OTHER'S BACK MISTER BARKER SHARED WITH MISTER BENYON THE HONOUR OF BEING FIRST MAN IN
7000-83708-0009 THE LATCHMERE CAPTAIN AS A CAPTAIN HAD BECOME QUITE AS MUCH A FIGUREHEAD AS I HAD HIS BEARING WAS INDICATIVE OF EXTREME DEPRESSION I THINK HE HAD LEARNED THAT TO TAKE OFF HAND THE FIRST SUBSTITUTE WHO OFFERED WAS NOW AND THEN
7000-83708-0010 UNWISE TO ENABLE HIM TO BAT WITH MORE ADVANTAGE MISTER BENYON HAD REMOVED HIS WAISTCOAT WHICH MATCHED HIS TROUSERS AND HIS COAT WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH IT I CANNOT SAY
7000-83708-0011 NOW HE HAD ON A BRIGHT RED FLANNEL SHIRT HIS TASTES IN COSTUME SEEMED A TRIFLE LURID THE SLEEVES OF WHICH WERE TURNED UP ABOVE THE ELBOWS HIS POSE WAS ALMOST AS PECULIAR AS HIS COSTUME HE STOOD BOLT UPRIGHT
7000-83708-0012 HIS LEGS TOGETHER HIS FEET DRAWN HEEL TO HEEL NOT AT ALL IN THE FASHION OF A MODERN CRICKETER WHO SEEKS TO GUARD HIS WICKETS WITH HIS LEGS HIS BAT HE HELD STRAIGHT DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM THE BLADE SWINGING GENTLY IN THE AIR
7000-83708-0013 I AM AFRAID I WASTED MORE TIME IN PREPARING TO DELIVER MY FIRST BALL THAN I NEED HAVE DONE BUT IF MISTER BENYON HAD NOT HAD A SMACK WITH A BAT FOR TWENTY YEARS IT WAS A GOOD FIFTEEN SINCE I HAD BOWLED A BALL
7000-83708-0014 AFTER SUCH A LAPSE OF TIME ONE REQUIRES TO PULL ONESELF TOGETHER BEFORE EXHIBITING ONE'S POWERS TO A CRICKETER OF MISTER BENYON'S CALIBRE HE HOWEVER DID NOT SEEM TO RECOGNISE THE NECESSITY WHICH I MYSELF FELT THAT I WAS UNDER
7000-83708-0015 HURRY UP SIR DON'T I TELL YOU THAT SOON I'LL HAVE TO GO I HURRIED UP I GAVE HIM AN OVERHAND FULL PITCH WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE A DECENT CATCH FOR POINT IF POINT HAD BEEN CLOSE IN WHICH HE WASN'T HOWEVER IN ANY CASE MISTER BENYON WOULD HAVE SAVED HIM THE TROUBLE
7000-83708-0016 HE HIT THE BALL A CRACK THE LIKE OF WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE HE DROVE IT OVER THE HEDGE AND OVER THE TREES AND UP TO THE SKIES AND OUT OF SIGHT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BAD LITTLE SMACK TO START WITH HE OBSERVED I LIKE YOUR KIND OF BOWLING MISTER
7000-83708-0017 I SUPPOSE THAT'S A BOUNDARY HE CALLED TO THE SCORER IF THERE WAS ONE WHICH I DOUBT PUT DOWN TOM BENYON SIX HE TURNED AGAIN TO ME IT'S NO GOOD WASTING TIME LOOKING FOR THAT BALL I'VE ANOTHER IN MY POCKET YOU CAN HAVE
7000-83708-0018 HE PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS TROUSERS POCKET THOSE REMARKABLE GARMENTS FITTED HIM LIKE EEL SKINS
7000-83708-0019 HAVE SUCH A THING AS A CRICKET BALL IN ONE OF THE POCKETS
7000-83708-0020 HE DREW ONE OUT AND THREW IT UP TO ME MY SECOND BALL WAS A COLOURABLE IMITATION OF MY FIRST ONLY THIS TIME IT WAS WIDE TO LEG TO LONG LEG MISTER BENYON SENT IT FLYING PUT DOWN TOM BENYON ANOTHER SIX HE CRIED I DO LIKE YOUR BOWLING MISTER
7000-83708-0021 I'VE GOT ANOTHER BALL WHICH YOU CAN HAVE HE PRODUCED A SECOND BALL FROM THE SAME POCKET FROM WHICH THE FIRST HAD COME I COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE MY EYES BUT I WAS DISCOVERING WITH HORATIO THAT THERE WERE MORE THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH THAN HAD BEEN CONTAINED IN MY PHILOSOPHY
7000-83708-0022 SINCE MISTER BENYON PROFESSED SUCH AFFECTION FOR THE STYLE OF BOWLING WHICH I FAVOURED I SENT HIM DOWN ANOTHER SAMPLE THIS TIME IT WAS FAIRLY STRAIGHT BY WHICH I MEAN THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE PITCHED MORE THAN A YARD FROM THE WICKETS IF MISTER BENYON HAD ALLOWED IT TO PITCH WHICH HE DIDN'T
7000-83708-0023 HE DROVE IT WITH TERRIFIC FORCE RIGHT ABOVE MY HEAD NEVER MIND ABOUT THE BALL HE SAID I'VE GOT ANOTHER IN MY POCKET HE HAD THE THIRD AND IN THE SAME POCKET FROM WHICH THE OTHER TWO HAD COME
7000-83708-0024 MY FOURTH BALL HE TREATED TO A SWIPE TO SQUARE LEG HE SEEMED TO HAVE A PARTIALITY FOR SWIPING QUITE UNNECESSARILY HE ALLOWED THAT THIS WAS SO I DO LIKE A BALL WHICH I CAN GET A SMACK AT
7000-83708-0025 HE REMARKED AS HE PRODUCED A FOURTH BALL FROM THE SAME POCKET OF HIS TIGHTLY FITTING TROUSERS WHICH HAD CONTAINED THE OTHER THREE A SWIPE DOES WARM ME SO YOUR KIND OF BOWLING MISTER S JUST THE THING IT WAS KIND OF HIM TO SAY SO THOUGH TO MY THINKING
7000-83708-0026 HIS REMARK DID NOT CONVEY A COMPLIMENT WHEN HE SENT MY FIFTH BALL OUT OF SIGHT I WISHED THAT HIS LOVE FOR SWIPING HAD BEEN LESS OR MY BOWLING OF ANOTHER KIND THE SIXTH HOWEVER WHICH HE ALSO PRODUCED FROM THE SAME WONDROUS STORE CONTAINED IN HIS BREECHES POCKET
7000-83708-0027 HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH WHAT HE CALLED SNICKING THAT'S WHAT I CALL A PRETTY SNICK HE SAID THE SNICK IN QUESTION WAS A TREMENDOUS DRIVE TO DEEP MID OFF IT WAS STOPPED QUITE INVOLUNTARILY BY MISTER HAWTHORN AND MISTER HEDGES
7000-83708-0028 SO FAR AS I COULD SEE IT STUNNED THE PAIR OF THEM NEITHER OF THEM MADE THE SLIGHTEST ATTEMPT TO RETURN THE BALL RUN IT OUT CRIED MISTER BENYON HE AND MISTER BARKER BEGAN TO RUN THEY RAN FOUR AND THEN THEY RAN TWO MORE AND STILL THE BALL WAS NOT THROWN IN
7000-83708-0029 MISTER BENYON URGED THE FIELDERS ON HURRY UP BILL HEDGES MISTER HEDGES DID NOT HURRY UP HE NEVER COULD HAVE HURRIED UP EVEN IF HIS MANNER OF FIELDING THE BALL HAD NOT WHOLLY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS WIND BUT THE BALL WAS AT LAST THROWN IN
7000-83708-0030 OUT OF THE AVERAGE BOWLER AND MISTER BENYON'S LAST PERFORMANCE HIS SNICK HAD PLACED HIM AT THE OTHER WICKET PREPARED TO RECEIVE MISTER SAPSWORTH'S BOWLING WHEN IT CAME NOW BOB SAPSWORTH
7000-83708-0031 CRACK SMACK WHACK WENT THE BALLS OUT OF SIGHT IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND FOR EACH BALL THAT DISAPPEARED MISTER BENYON PRODUCED ANOTHER FROM HIS BREECHES POCKET I FELT THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE HAPPENING TO ME IN A DREAM
7000-83708-0032 I WAS RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE CONDITION IN WHICH ALICE MUST HAVE BEEN IN WONDERLAND PREPARED FOR ANYTHING TIME WENT ON MISTER SAPSWORTH AND I BOWLED OVER AFTER OVER MISTER BENYON WAS MAKING A RECORD IN TALL SCORING
7000-83708-0033 AND THE BALLS HE LOST AND THE BALLS WHICH HE PRODUCED AND THE DIABOLICAL INGENUITY WITH WHICH HE MANAGED AT THE CLOSE OF EVERY OVER TO CHANGE HIS END IF MISTER BARKER DID NO HITTING HE DID SOME RUNNING HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO MAKE A STROKE
7000-83708-0034 BUT HIS PARTNER TOOK CARE TO MAKE HIM RUN AN INCREDIBLY LARGE ODD NUMBER AS A WIND UP TO EVERY OVER MISTER BENYON DID NOT SEEM TO BE DISTRESSED BY THE EXERTION IN THE LEAST MISTER BARKER EMPHATICALLY DID
7000-83708-0035 MISTER BENYON HAD BUOYED US UP BY HIS STATEMENT THAT HE WOULD SOON HAVE TO GO HIS IDEAS OF SOON WERE DIFFERENT FROM OURS I SUPPOSE AT THE OUTSIDE OUR INNINGS HAD LASTED HALF AN HOUR HOW LONG WE BOWLED TO MISTER BENYON IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
7000-83708-0036 I KNOW THAT I BOWLED UNTIL I FELT THAT I SHOULD EITHER HAVE TO STOP OR DROP BY DEGREES ONE FACT BEGAN TO BE IMPRESSED UPON ME IT WAS THIS THAT THE NUMBER OF SPECTATORS WAS GROWING SMALLER BY DEGREES AND BEAUTIFULLY LESS
7000-83708-0037 ORIGINALLY THERE HAD BEEN QUITE A CROWD ASSEMBLED IN COURSE OF TIME THIS HAD DWINDLED TO HALF A DOZEN STRAGGLERS A LITTLE LATER ON EVEN THESE HAD GONE
7000-83708-0038 OR HIS GHOST WHAT WAS MORE SOME OF OUR OWN TEAM TOOK COURAGE AND LEG BAIL I CAUGHT ONE OF THEM THE LAD FENNING IN THE ACT OF SCRAMBLING THROUGH THE HEDGE BUT I HAD NOT THE HEART TO STOP HIM I ONLY WISHED THAT I HAD BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO HAVE LED THE VAN
7000-83708-0039 THE THING GREW SERIOUS SO FAR AS I COULD SEE MISTER HAWTHORN MISTER HEDGES MISTER SAPSWORTH AND I WERE THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE STORWELL TEAM LEFT ON THE GROUND AND THE REFLECTION INVOLUNTARILY CROSSED MY MIND WHAT FOOLS WE WERE TO STAY
7000-83708-0040 THE AMOUNT OF RUNNING ABOUT WE HAD TO DO AND THE WAY IN WHICH MISTER BENYON URGED US ON THE PERSPIRATION WAS RUNNING OFF FROM US IN STREAMS I HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A SWEATER BEFORE I DO LIKE YOUR KIND OF BOWLING MISTER MISTER BENYON WOULD CONSTANTLY REMARK
7000-83708-0041 IF I HAD HAD AN EQUAL ADMIRATION FOR HIS KIND OF BATTING WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUITS BUT I HAD NOT AT LEAST NOT THEN A LITTLE LATER LOOKING ROUND THE FIELD I FOUND THAT MISTER HAWTHORN HAD DISAPPEARED AND THAT MISTER HEDGES STUCK IN A HEDGE
7000-83708-0042 WAS STRUGGLING GALLANTLY TO REACH SAFETY ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS THE LAST BALL OF MISTER SAPSWORTH'S OVER MISTER BENYON RAN THIRTEEN FOR A HIT TO LEG HE MADE MISTER BARKER RUN THEM TOO IT WAS THE PROVERBIAL LAST STRAW
7000-83708-0043 AS MISTER BARKER WAS RUNNING THE THIRTEENTH RUN INSTEAD OF GOING TO HIS WICKET HE DROPPED HIS BAT THE BAT WHICH HE HAD NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO UTILISE AND BOLTED OFF THE FIELD AS THOUGH SATAN WAS BEHIND HIM MISTER BENYON CALLED OUT TO HIM
7000-83708-0044 BUT MISTER BARKER NEITHER STOPPED NOR STAYED IT SEEMED THAT THE MATCH WAS GOING TO RESOLVE ITSELF INTO A GAME OF SINGLE WICKET TO MAKE THINGS BETTER
7000-83708-0045 HE FIRST STOOD CLOSE UP TO THE HEDGE THEN HE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEDGE THEN I DOUBT IF HE STOOD UPON THE OTHER SIDE BUT AT LEAST HE HAD VANISHED FROM MY KEN AND I WAS LEFT ALONE TO BOWL TO MISTER BENYON THAT OVER
7000-83708-0046 I DO LIKE YOUR KIND OF BOWLING MISTER HE OBSERVED WHEN AS USUAL HE SENT MY FIRST BALL OUT OF SIGHT NEVER MIND ABOUT THE BALL I'VE GOT ONE IN MY POCKET YOU CAN HAVE HE HAD HE PRODUCED IT ALWAYS FROM THE SAME POCKET IT WAS ABOUT THE SECOND THOUSAND
