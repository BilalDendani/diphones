1096-128265-0000 BEHOLD ZARATHUSTRA EVEN THE PEOPLE LEARN FROM THEE AND ACQUIRE FAITH IN THY TEACHING BUT FOR THEM TO BELIEVE FULLY IN THEE ONE THING IS STILL NEEDFUL THOU MUST FIRST OF ALL CONVINCE US CRIPPLES
1096-128265-0001 HERE HAST THOU NOW A FINE SELECTION AND VERILY AN OPPORTUNITY WITH MORE THAN ONE FORELOCK THE BLIND CANST THOU HEAL AND MAKE THE LAME RUN
1096-128265-0002 AND FROM HIM WHO HATH TOO MUCH BEHIND COULDST THOU WELL ALSO TAKE AWAY A LITTLE THAT I THINK WOULD BE THE RIGHT METHOD TO MAKE THE CRIPPLES BELIEVE IN ZARATHUSTRA
1096-128265-0003 ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER ANSWERED THUS UNTO HIM WHO SO SPAKE WHEN ONE TAKETH HIS HUMP FROM THE HUNCHBACK THEN DOTH ONE TAKE FROM HIM HIS SPIRIT
1096-128265-0004 SO DO THE PEOPLE TEACH AND WHEN ONE GIVETH THE BLIND MAN EYES THEN DOTH HE SEE TOO MANY BAD THINGS ON THE EARTH SO THAT HE CURSETH HIM WHO HEALED HIM
1096-128265-0005 HE HOWEVER WHO MAKETH THE LAME MAN RUN INFLICTETH UPON HIM THE GREATEST INJURY FOR HARDLY CAN HE RUN WHEN HIS VICES RUN AWAY WITH HIM SO DO THE PEOPLE TEACH CONCERNING CRIPPLES
1096-128265-0006 AND WHY SHOULD NOT ZARATHUSTRA ALSO LEARN FROM THE PEOPLE WHEN THE PEOPLE LEARN FROM ZARATHUSTRA IT IS HOWEVER THE SMALLEST THING UNTO ME SINCE I HAVE BEEN AMONGST MEN
1096-128265-0007 TO SEE ONE PERSON LACKING AN EYE ANOTHER AN EAR AND A THIRD A LEG AND THAT OTHERS HAVE LOST THE TONGUE OR THE NOSE OR THE HEAD I SEE AND HAVE SEEN WORSE THINGS
1096-128265-0008 AND DIVERS THINGS SO HIDEOUS THAT I SHOULD NEITHER LIKE TO SPEAK OF ALL MATTERS NOR EVEN KEEP SILENT ABOUT SOME OF THEM NAMELY MEN WHO LACK EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT THEY HAVE TOO MUCH OF ONE THING
1096-128265-0009 OR SOMETHING ELSE BIG REVERSED CRIPPLES I CALL SUCH MEN AND WHEN I CAME OUT OF MY SOLITUDE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME PASSED OVER THIS BRIDGE THEN I COULD NOT TRUST MINE EYES BUT LOOKED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SAID AT LAST
1096-128265-0010 THAT IS AN EAR AN EAR AS BIG AS A MAN I LOOKED STILL MORE ATTENTIVELY AND ACTUALLY THERE DID MOVE UNDER THE EAR SOMETHING THAT WAS PITIABLY SMALL AND POOR AND SLIM AND IN TRUTH
1096-128265-0011 THIS IMMENSE EAR WAS PERCHED ON A SMALL THIN STALK THE STALK HOWEVER WAS A MAN A PERSON PUTTING A GLASS TO HIS EYES COULD EVEN RECOGNISE FURTHER A SMALL ENVIOUS COUNTENANCE
1096-128265-0012 AND ALSO THAT A BLOATED SOULLET DANGLED AT THE STALK THE PEOPLE TOLD ME HOWEVER THAT THE BIG EAR WAS NOT ONLY A MAN BUT A GREAT MAN A GENIUS BUT I NEVER BELIEVED IN THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SPAKE OF GREAT MEN
1096-128265-0013 AND I HOLD TO MY BELIEF THAT IT WAS A REVERSED CRIPPLE WHO HAD TOO LITTLE OF EVERYTHING AND TOO MUCH OF ONE THING WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SPOKEN THUS UNTO THE HUNCHBACK
1096-128265-0014 AND UNTO THOSE OF WHOM THE HUNCHBACK WAS THE MOUTHPIECE AND ADVOCATE THEN DID HE TURN TO HIS DISCIPLES IN PROFOUND DEJECTION AND SAID
1096-128265-0015 AS ON A BATTLE AND BUTCHER GROUND AND WHEN MINE EYE FLEETH FROM THE PRESENT TO THE BYGONE IT FINDETH EVER THE SAME FRAGMENTS AND LIMBS AND FEARFUL CHANCES BUT NO MEN
1096-128265-0016 THE PRESENT AND THE BYGONE UPON EARTH AH MY FRIENDS THAT IS MY MOST UNBEARABLE TROUBLE AND I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO LIVE IF I WERE NOT A SEER OF WHAT IS TO COME
1096-128265-0017 A SEER A PURPOSER A CREATOR A FUTURE ITSELF AND A BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE AND ALAS ALSO AS IT WERE A CRIPPLE ON THIS BRIDGE ALL THAT IS ZARATHUSTRA
1096-128265-0018 AND YE ALSO ASKED YOURSELVES OFTEN WHO IS ZARATHUSTRA TO US WHAT SHALL HE BE CALLED BY US AND LIKE ME DID YE GIVE YOURSELVES QUESTIONS FOR ANSWERS IS HE A PROMISER OR A FULFILLER
1096-128265-0019 A CONQUEROR OR AN INHERITOR A HARVEST OR A PLOUGHSHARE A PHYSICIAN OR A HEALED ONE IS HE A POET OR A GENUINE ONE AN EMANCIPATOR OR A SUBJUGATOR A GOOD ONE OR AN EVIL ONE
1096-128265-0020 I WALK AMONGST MEN AS THE FRAGMENTS OF THE FUTURE THAT FUTURE WHICH I CONTEMPLATE AND IT IS ALL MY POETISATION AND ASPIRATION TO COMPOSE AND COLLECT INTO UNITY
1096-128265-0021 WHAT IS FRAGMENT AND RIDDLE AND FEARFUL CHANCE AND HOW COULD I ENDURE TO BE A MAN IF MAN WERE NOT ALSO THE COMPOSER AND RIDDLE READER AND REDEEMER OF CHANCE
1096-128265-0022 INTO THUS WOULD I HAVE IT THAT ONLY DO I CALL REDEMPTION WILL SO IS THE EMANCIPATOR AND JOY BRINGER CALLED THUS HAVE I TAUGHT YOU MY FRIENDS
1096-128265-0023 BUT NOW LEARN THIS LIKEWISE THE WILL ITSELF IS STILL A PRISONER WILLING EMANCIPATETH BUT WHAT IS THAT
1096-128265-0024 CALLED WHICH STILL PUTTETH THE EMANCIPATOR IN CHAINS IT WAS THUS IS THE WILL'S TEETH GNASHING AND LONESOMEST TRIBULATION CALLED IMPOTENT TOWARDS WHAT HATH BEEN DONE
1096-128265-0025 IT IS A MALICIOUS SPECTATOR OF ALL THAT IS PAST NOT BACKWARD CAN THE WILL WILL THAT IT CANNOT BREAK TIME AND TIME'S DESIRE THAT IS THE WILL'S LONESOMEST TRIBULATION
1096-128265-0026 WILLING EMANCIPATETH WHAT DOTH WILLING ITSELF DEVISE IN ORDER TO GET FREE FROM ITS TRIBULATION AND MOCK AT ITS PRISON AH A FOOL BECOMETH EVERY PRISONER
1096-128265-0027 FOOLISHLY DELIVERETH ITSELF ALSO THE IMPRISONED WILL THAT TIME DOTH NOT RUN BACKWARD THAT IS ITS ANIMOSITY THAT WHICH WAS
1096-128265-0028 SO IS THE STONE WHICH IT CANNOT ROLL CALLED AND THUS DOTH IT ROLL STONES OUT OF ANIMOSITY AND ILL HUMOUR AND TAKETH REVENGE ON WHATEVER DOTH NOT LIKE IT FEEL RAGE AND ILL HUMOUR
1096-128265-0029 THUS DID THE WILL THE EMANCIPATOR BECOME A TORTURER AND ON ALL THAT IS CAPABLE OF SUFFERING IT TAKETH REVENGE BECAUSE IT CANNOT GO BACKWARD
1096-128265-0030 THIS YEA THIS ALONE IS REVENGE ITSELF THE WILL'S ANTIPATHY TO TIME AND ITS IT WAS VERILY A GREAT FOLLY DWELLETH IN OUR WILL
1096-128265-0031 AND IT BECAME A CURSE UNTO ALL HUMANITY THAT THIS FOLLY ACQUIRED SPIRIT THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE MY FRIENDS THAT HATH HITHERTO BEEN MAN'S BEST CONTEMPLATION
1096-128265-0032 AND WHERE THERE WAS SUFFERING IT WAS CLAIMED THERE WAS ALWAYS PENALTY PENALTY SO CALLETH ITSELF REVENGE WITH A LYING WORD IT FEIGNETH A GOOD CONSCIENCE
1096-128265-0033 AND BECAUSE IN THE WILLER HIMSELF THERE IS SUFFERING BECAUSE HE CANNOT WILL BACKWARDS THUS WAS WILLING ITSELF AND ALL LIFE CLAIMED TO BE PENALTY AND THEN DID CLOUD AFTER CLOUD ROLL OVER THE SPIRIT
1096-128265-0034 EVERYTHING PERISHETH THEREFORE EVERYTHING DESERVETH TO PERISH AND THIS ITSELF IS JUSTICE THE LAW OF TIME THAT HE MUST DEVOUR HIS CHILDREN THUS DID MADNESS PREACH
1096-128265-0035 MORALLY ARE THINGS ORDERED ACCORDING TO JUSTICE AND PENALTY OH WHERE IS THERE DELIVERANCE FROM THE FLUX OF THINGS AND FROM THE EXISTENCE OF PENALTY THUS DID MADNESS PREACH
1096-128265-0036 CAN THERE BE DELIVERANCE WHEN THERE IS ETERNAL JUSTICE ALAS UNROLLABLE IS THE STONE IT WAS ETERNAL MUST ALSO BE ALL PENALTIES THUS DID MADNESS PREACH
1096-128265-0037 NO DEED CAN BE ANNIHILATED HOW COULD IT BE UNDONE BY THE PENALTY THIS THIS IS WHAT IS ETERNAL IN THE EXISTENCE OF PENALTY THAT EXISTENCE ALSO MUST BE ETERNALLY RECURRING DEED AND GUILT
1096-128265-0038 UNLESS THE WILL SHOULD AT LAST DELIVER ITSELF AND WILLING BECOME NON WILLING BUT YE KNOW MY BRETHREN THIS FABULOUS SONG OF MADNESS AWAY FROM THOSE FABULOUS SONGS DID I LEAD YOU WHEN I TAUGHT YOU
1096-128265-0039 THE WILL IS A CREATOR ALL IT WAS IS A FRAGMENT A RIDDLE A FEARFUL CHANCE
1096-128265-0040 BUT THUS WOULD I HAVE IT
1096-128265-0041 BUT THUS DO I WILL IT THUS SHALL I WILL IT BUT DID IT EVER SPEAK THUS AND WHEN DOTH THIS TAKE PLACE HATH THE WILL BEEN UNHARNESSED FROM ITS OWN FOLLY
1096-128265-0042 HATH THE WILL BECOME ITS OWN DELIVERER AND JOY BRINGER HATH IT UNLEARNED THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE AND ALL TEETH GNASHING AND WHO HATH TAUGHT IT RECONCILIATION WITH TIME AND SOMETHING HIGHER THAN ALL RECONCILIATION
1096-128265-0043 SOMETHING HIGHER THAN ALL RECONCILIATION MUST THE WILL WILL WHICH IS THE WILL TO POWER BUT HOW DOTH THAT TAKE PLACE WHO HATH TAUGHT IT ALSO TO WILL BACKWARDS
1096-128265-0044 BUT AT THIS POINT IN HIS DISCOURSE IT CHANCED THAT ZARATHUSTRA SUDDENLY PAUSED AND LOOKED LIKE A PERSON IN THE GREATEST ALARM WITH TERROR IN HIS EYES DID HE GAZE ON HIS DISCIPLES
1096-128265-0045 HIS GLANCES PIERCED AS WITH ARROWS THEIR THOUGHTS AND ARREAR THOUGHTS
1096-128265-0046 IT IS DIFFICULT TO LIVE AMONGST MEN BECAUSE SILENCE IS SO DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY FOR A BABBLER THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THE HUNCHBACK HOWEVER HAD LISTENED TO THE CONVERSATION
1096-128265-0047 AND HAD COVERED HIS FACE DURING THE TIME BUT WHEN HE HEARD ZARATHUSTRA LAUGH HE LOOKED UP WITH CURIOSITY AND SAID SLOWLY BUT WHY DOTH ZARATHUSTRA SPEAK OTHERWISE UNTO US THAN UNTO HIS DISCIPLES
1096-128265-0048 ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED WHAT IS THERE TO BE WONDERED AT WITH HUNCHBACKS ONE MAY WELL SPEAK IN A HUNCHBACKED WAY VERY GOOD SAID THE HUNCHBACK AND WITH PUPILS ONE MAY WELL TELL TALES OUT OF SCHOOL
1096-128265-0049 BUT WHY DOTH ZARATHUSTRA SPEAK OTHERWISE UNTO HIS PUPILS
