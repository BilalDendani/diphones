6459-70128-0000 AND THE WRECK OF THE EAGLE ISN'T NEAR ENOUGH FOR ME TO GET ANYTHING FROM THE SHIP STILL I OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL I'M NOT DROWNED OR EATEN BY A SHARK BOB WAS TIRED AFTER HIS LONG SWIM
6459-70128-0001 AND STRETCHED OUT UNDER THE TREES ON THE GRASS TO REST IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GET MUCH WARMER
6459-70128-0002 SEEMINGLY FROM BENEATH THE OCEAN WONDER IF I'M GOING TO FIND ANYTHING TO EAT HERE THE BOY THOUGHT DOESN'T LOOK AS IF ANY ONE LIVED HERE I'LL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY LONESOME HERE
6459-70128-0003 I WONDER IF ANY SHIPS EVER PASS THIS PLACE THERE WERE SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT NEEDED ANSWERING HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO STOP ASKING THEM OF HIMSELF BUT HE DECIDED THE FIRST AND BEST THING TO DO
6459-70128-0004 WOULD BE TO GET OFF HIS WET CLOTHES NOT THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF TAKING COLD BUT HE KNEW HE WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE IN DRY GARMENTS SO TAKING EVERYTHING OUT OF HIS POCKETS WHICH WAS NO SMALL OPERATION BY THE WAY
6459-70128-0005 AS BOB WAS A TYPICAL BOY HE STRIPPED HIMSELF OF HIS HEAVIER GARMENTS AND HUNG THEM ON TREE LIMBS TO DRY NOW IF I COULD FIND SOMETHING TO EAT I'D BE RIGHT IN IT AT LEAST FOR A WHILE THOUGHT THE CASTAWAY
6459-70128-0006 AS HE WALKED AROUND ON THE WARM GRASS AND I NEED A DRINK FOR I SWALLOWED A LOT OF SALT WATER AND I'M AS DRY AS A POWDER HORN HE LOOKED OUT ON THE OCEAN BUT NOT A TRACE OF A BOAT WAS VISIBLE
6459-70128-0007 BOB WALKED SOME DISTANCE FROM WHERE HE HAD LANDED KEEPING A SHARP LOOKOUT FOR A SPRING OF WATER
6459-70128-0008 AND HE BEGAN TO THINK HE WOULD HAVE TO DIG A LITTLE WELL NEAR SHORE WITH CLAM SHELLS AS HE HAD READ OF SHIPWRECKED SAILORS DOING BUT FORTUNATELY HE WAS NOT FORCED TO THIS AS HE PENETRATED A LITTLE WAY INTO THE WOOD
6459-70128-0009 THAT SOUNDS GOOD HE REMARKED STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY BECAUSE OF HIS BARE FEET HE WENT ON A LITTLE FARTHER AND PRESENTLY SAW A SMALL WATERFALL CAUSED BY A STREAM TUMBLING OVER A LITTLE LEDGE OF ROCKS
6459-70128-0010 AND SPLASHING INTO A POOL BELOW THAT LOOKS BETTER THAN IT SOUNDS THOUGHT BOB AND A MOMENT LATER HE WAS DRINKING HIS FILL
6459-70128-0011 HE WENT ON GLANCING AT THE POOL GUESS I'LL TRY IT BOB WAS FOND OF HUNTING AND FISHING AND KNEW CONSIDERABLE ABOUT WOOD LORE SEARCHING UNDER THE STONES HE SOON FOUND SOME WORMS
6459-70128-0012 AND TOSSING ONE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE POOL HE SAW A HUNGRY FISH RISE TO IT NOW IF I HAD A POLE HOOK AND LINE
6459-70128-0013 HE WENT ON TO HIMSELF I HAVE THE LINE ALL RIGHT AND I OUGHT TO HAVE A HOOK IN ONE OF MY POCKETS I GENERALLY DO AS FOR A POLE I CAN EASILY CUT ONE
6459-70128-0014 IT DID NOT TAKE HIM LONG TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD A STOUT CORD THAT WOULD ANSWER FOR A LINE
6459-70128-0015 WITH HIS KNIFE HE CUT A POLE AND BAITING THE HOOK WITH A WORM HE CAST IN PROBABLY NO ONE UNLESS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME UNFORTUNATE CASTAWAY IN YEARS GONE BY HAD EVER ANGLED IN THAT POOL
6459-70128-0016 THE FISH AT ONCE ROSE TO THE BAIT
6459-70128-0017 NOW TO COOK THEM HE SAID TO HIMSELF LUCKY I BOUGHT A WATER PROOF MATCH BOX BEFORE I STARTED ON THIS VOYAGE I CAN NOW MAKE A FIRE BOB WENT BACK TO THE PLACE HE CALLED HOME
6459-70128-0018 WHERE HE HAD FIRST LANDED AND LOOKED IN THE WATER TIGHT MATCH BOX
6459-70128-0019 TO HIS DELIGHT THE LITTLE FIRE STICKS WERE NOT HARMED BY HIS BATH HE ONLY WISHED HE HAD MORE OF THEM FINDING HIS CLOTHES WERE NOW NEARLY DRY HE PUT PART OF THEM ON AND PROCEEDED TO KINDLE A FIRE
6459-70128-0020 THEN HE CLEANED THE FISH AND SET THEM TO BROIL BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF HANGING THEM IN FRONT OF THE FIRE ON A POINTED STICK ONE END OF WHICH WAS THRUST INTO THE GROUND THAT SMELLS GOOD EXCLAIMED BOB
6459-70128-0021 AS THE FISH BEGAN TO BROWN BUT I ALMOST FORGOT THERE'S PLENTY OF FRUIT TO BE HAD
6459-70128-0022 I'LL NOT STARVE HERE AS LONG AS I HAVE FRUIT AND FISH HE GATHERED SOME THINGS THAT LOOKED A CROSS BETWEEN AN ORANGE AND A TANGERINE AND ATE SEVERAL FINDING THEM DELICIOUS
6459-70128-0023 BOB PREPARING TO EAT HIS ODD BREAKFAST WAS SUDDENLY STARTLED BY A GROAN IT SEEMED TO COME FROM BEHIND A PILE OF ROCKS OFF TO THE LEFT I WONDER WHAT THAT WAS THOUGHT BOB AN ANIMAL OR A HUMAN BEING
6459-70128-0024 I WONDER IF THERE ARE ANY SOUTH SEA NATIVES ON THIS ISLAND HE PUT DOWN HIS FISH ON SOME BIG GREEN LEAVES HE HAD PLUCKED FOR PLATES AND WENT TOWARD THE ROCKS
6459-70128-0025 HE EXCLAIMED HE TOO MUST HAVE FALLEN OVERBOARD AND BEEN WASHED ASHORE BUT HE SEEMS TO BE HURT THE MAN'S EYES WERE CLOSED AND HE WAS SCARCELY BREATHING HE'S DYING THOUGHT BOB HIS HEART BEATING HARD
6459-70128-0026 THEN THINKING PERHAPS THE MAN MIGHT BE PARTLY DROWNED THE YOUNG CASTAWAY BEGAN TO PUT INTO OPERATION AS MUCH OF THE DIRECTIONS AS HE REMEMBERED FOR RESTORING PARTIALLY DROWNED PERSONS TO LIFE
6459-70128-0027 HE HAD NOT WORKED LONG BEFORE HE SAW MISTER TARBILL'S EYES OPEN THEN THE NERVOUS PASSENGER BEGAN TO BREATHE BETTER WHERE WHERE AM I HE ASKED FAINTLY YOU'RE SAFE REPLIED BOB ON AN ISLAND WITH ME
6459-70128-0028 BUT WHERE IS THE CAPTAIN AND THE OTHERS BOAT FOUNDERED WAVE WASHED OVER IT SOON AFTER YOU FELL OVERBOARD NO CHANCE TO GET LIFE PRESERVERS IT WAS EVERY ONE FOR HIMSELF ARE THEY DROWNED
6459-70128-0029 I DON'T KNOW OH IT IS TERRIBLE I SWAM AS LONG AS I COULD THEN I SEEMED TO BE SINKING YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW SAID BOB CHEERFULLY YOU'RE JUST IN TIME TO HAVE SOME BREAKFAST
6459-70128-0030 HE HELPED MISTER TARBILL TO HIS FEET THE NERVOUS MAN SEEMED TO RECOVER RAPIDLY AND WHEN AT BOB'S SUGGESTION HE HAD TAKEN OFF MOST OF HIS WET CLOTHES AND WAS DRYING OUT NEAR THE FIRE
6459-70128-0031 THOSE FISH SMELL FINE HE SAID
6459-70128-0032 I'M NOT SURE REPLIED BOB
6459-70128-0033 THE MEAT LOOKS NICE AND WHITE
6459-70128-0034 I'LL WARM THEM AGAIN HE PUT THEM ONCE MORE ON THE POINTED STICKS NEAR THE FIRE AND WHEN THEY WERE SIZZLING HE LAID THEM ON THE GREEN LEAVES THEN WITH STICKS FOR KNIVES AND FORKS THE TWO CASTAWAYS MADE A FAIRLY GOOD MEAL
6459-70128-0035 SAID THE NERVOUS MAN AS HE BEGAN TO DRESS IN HIS DRY CLOTHES AFTER THE BREAKFAST THIS HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE FOR ME I GUESS IT HAS ADMITTED BOB AND FOR ALL OF US I WISH I KNEW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE CAPTAIN AND THE OTHERS
6459-70128-0036 OUR BOAT WAS SWAMPED BY A BIG WAVE SAID MISTER TARBILL AND SUDDENLY WE WERE ALL THROWN INTO THE WATER THAT IS THE LAST I REMEMBER PERHAPS THE CAPTAIN AND SOME OF THE CREW MAY HAVE SWUM ASHORE
6459-70128-0037 I HOPE SO WE'LL SEARCH FOR THEM I GUESS WE'RE IN FOR A LONG STAY HAVE WE GOT TO REMAIN HERE DEMANDED MISTER TARBILL I DON'T SEE WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO DO REPLIED BOB
6459-70128-0038 WE HAVEN'T ANY BOAT WE CAN'T WALK ON THE WATER
6459-70128-0039 OH DEAR EXCLAIMED THE NERVOUS MAN
6459-70128-0040 BOB THOUGHT HE MIGHT AT LEAST BE THANKFUL THAT HIS LIFE WAS SPARED AND THAT HE WAS NOT WHERE HE WOULD STARVE BUT THE LAD CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE WISE TO SAY NOTHING
6459-70128-0041 HE RESOLVED TO ACT WISELY AND CAUTIOUSLY FOR THERE WAS NO TELLING HOW LONG THEY WOULD HAVE TO LIVE ON THE ISLAND WITH THE BOY IN THE LEAD THE TWO STARTED OFF THE SUN WAS NOW HOT AND STRONG
6459-70128-0042 AND THEY FOUND IT ADVISABLE TO KEEP IN THE SHADE OF THE WOODS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BOB SAW A BIG TURTLE CRAWLING DOWN THE BEACH TOWARD THE WATER AND KNOWING THE FLESH WAS GOOD FOR FOOD HE RAN FORWARD TO CATCH IT
6459-70128-0043 HE WAS TOO LATE HOWEVER AND WHEN HE TURNED WITH A FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT
6459-70128-0044 BOB WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THE MAN UTTER AN EXCLAMATION HE HAD COME TO A HALT NEAR A PILE OF ROCKS AND WAS LOOKING OVER THE TOPS WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE BOY
6459-70128-0045 LET ME TAKE A LOOK PROPOSED BOB CAUTIOUSLY HE WENT FORWARD GAVE ONE GLANCE AT THE FIGURES TO WHICH MISTER TARBILL POINTED
6459-70128-0046 HURRAH HE SHOUTED
