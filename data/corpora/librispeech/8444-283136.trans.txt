8444-283136-0000 APPENDIX TWO OF SELF LOVE THERE IS A PRINCIPLE SUPPOSED TO PREVAIL AMONG MANY WHICH IS UTTERLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH ALL VIRTUE OR MORAL SENTIMENT
8444-283136-0001 AND AS IT CAN PROCEED FROM NOTHING BUT THE MOST DEPRAVED DISPOSITION SO IN ITS TURN IT TENDS STILL FURTHER TO ENCOURAGE THAT DEPRAVITY THIS PRINCIPLE IS THAT ALL
8444-283136-0002 BENEVOLENCE IS MERE HYPOCRISY FRIENDSHIP A CHEAT PUBLIC SPIRIT A FARCE FIDELITY A SNARE TO PROCURE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND THAT WHILE ALL OF US
8444-283136-0003 AT BOTTOM PURSUE ONLY OUR PRIVATE INTEREST WE WEAR THESE FAIR DISGUISES IN ORDER TO PUT OTHERS OFF THEIR GUARD AND EXPOSE THEM THE MORE TO OUR WILES AND MACHINATIONS
8444-283136-0004 WHAT HEART ONE MUST BE POSSESSED OF WHO POSSESSES SUCH PRINCIPLES AND WHO FEELS NO INTERNAL SENTIMENT THAT BELIES SO PERNICIOUS A THEORY IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE
8444-283136-0005 AND ALSO WHAT DEGREE OF AFFECTION AND BENEVOLENCE HE CAN BEAR TO A SPECIES WHOM HE REPRESENTS UNDER SUCH ODIOUS COLOURS AND SUPPOSES SO LITTLE SUSCEPTIBLE OF GRATITUDE OR ANY RETURN OF AFFECTION
8444-283136-0006 OR IF WE SHOULD NOT ASCRIBE THESE PRINCIPLES WHOLLY TO A CORRUPTED HEART WE MUST AT LEAST ACCOUNT FOR THEM FROM THE MOST CARELESS AND PRECIPITATE EXAMINATION
8444-283136-0007 SUPERFICIAL REASONERS INDEED OBSERVING MANY FALSE PRETENCES AMONG MANKIND AND FEELING PERHAPS NO VERY STRONG RESTRAINT IN THEIR OWN DISPOSITION
8444-283136-0008 MIGHT DRAW A GENERAL AND A HASTY CONCLUSION THAT ALL IS EQUALLY CORRUPTED AND THAT MEN DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER ANIMALS AND INDEED FROM ALL OTHER SPECIES OF EXISTENCE
8444-283136-0009 BUT ARE IN EVERY INSTANCE THE SAME CREATURES UNDER DIFFERENT DISGUISES AND APPEARANCES THERE IS ANOTHER PRINCIPLE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING THE FORMER
8444-283136-0010 WHICH HAS BEEN MUCH INSISTED ON BY PHILOSOPHERS AND HAS BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF MANY A SYSTEM THAT WHATEVER AFFECTION ONE MAY FEEL OR IMAGINE HE FEELS FOR OTHERS NO PASSION IS
8444-283136-0011 OR CAN BE DISINTERESTED THAT THE MOST GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP HOWEVER SINCERE IS A MODIFICATION OF SELF LOVE AND THAT EVEN UNKNOWN TO OURSELVES
8444-283136-0012 WE SEEK ONLY OUR OWN GRATIFICATION WHILE WE APPEAR THE MOST DEEPLY ENGAGED IN SCHEMES FOR THE LIBERTY AND HAPPINESS OF MANKIND BY A TURN OF IMAGINATION
8444-283136-0013 BY A REFINEMENT OF REFLECTION BY AN ENTHUSIASM OF PASSION WE SEEM TO TAKE PART IN THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS AND IMAGINE OURSELVES DIVESTED OF ALL SELFISH CONSIDERATIONS BUT
8444-283136-0014 AT BOTTOM THE MOST GENEROUS PATRIOT AND MOST NIGGARDLY MISER THE BRAVEST HERO AND MOST ABJECT COWARD HAVE IN EVERY ACTION AN EQUAL REGARD TO THEIR OWN HAPPINESS AND WELFARE
8444-283136-0015 WHOEVER CONCLUDES FROM THE SEEMING TENDENCY OF THIS OPINION THAT THOSE WHO MAKE PROFESSION OF IT CANNOT POSSIBLY FEEL THE TRUE SENTIMENTS OF BENEVOLENCE
8444-283136-0016 OR HAVE ANY REGARD FOR GENUINE VIRTUE WILL OFTEN FIND HIMSELF IN PRACTICE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN PROBITY AND HONOUR WERE NO STRANGERS TO EPICURUS AND HIS SECT
8444-283136-0017 ATTICUS AND HORACE SEEM TO HAVE ENJOYED FROM NATURE AND CULTIVATED BY REFLECTION AS GENEROUS AND FRIENDLY DISPOSITIONS AS ANY DISCIPLE OF THE AUSTERER SCHOOLS AND AMONG THE MODERN
8444-283136-0018 WHO MAINTAINED THE SELFISH SYSTEM OF MORALS LIVED IRREPROACHABLE LIVES THOUGH THE FORMER LAY NOT UNDER ANY RESTRAINT OF RELIGION WHICH MIGHT SUPPLY THE DEFECTS OF HIS PHILOSOPHY
8444-283136-0019 AN EPICUREAN OR A HOBBIST READILY ALLOWS THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A FRIENDSHIP IN THE WORLD WITHOUT HYPOCRISY OR DISGUISE THOUGH HE MAY ATTEMPT
8444-283136-0020 TO RESOLVE THE ELEMENTS OF THIS PASSION IF I MAY SO SPEAK INTO THOSE OF ANOTHER AND EXPLAIN EVERY AFFECTION TO BE SELF LOVE TWISTED AND MOULDED BY A PARTICULAR TURN OF IMAGINATION
8444-283136-0021 INTO A VARIETY OF APPEARANCES BUT AS THE SAME TURN OF IMAGINATION PREVAILS NOT IN EVERY MAN NOR GIVES THE SAME DIRECTION TO THE ORIGINAL PASSION
8444-283136-0022 THIS IS SUFFICIENT EVEN ACCORDING TO THE SELFISH SYSTEM TO MAKE THE WIDEST DIFFERENCE IN HUMAN CHARACTERS AND DENOMINATE ONE MAN VIRTUOUS AND HUMANE ANOTHER VICIOUS AND MEANLY INTERESTED
8444-283136-0023 I ESTEEM THE MAN WHOSE SELF LOVE BY WHATEVER MEANS IS SO DIRECTED AS TO GIVE HIM A CONCERN FOR OTHERS AND RENDER HIM SERVICEABLE TO SOCIETY AS I HATE OR DESPISE HIM
8444-283136-0024 WHO HAS NO REGARD TO ANY THING BEYOND HIS OWN GRATIFICATIONS AND ENJOYMENTS
8444-283136-0025 THOUGH SEEMINGLY OPPOSITE ARE AT BOTTOM THE SAME AND THAT A VERY INCONSIDERABLE TURN OF THOUGHT FORMS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM EACH CHARACTER
8444-283136-0026 NOTWITHSTANDING THESE INCONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES APPEARS TO ME IN PRACTICE PRETTY DURABLE AND UNTRANSMUTABLE
8444-283136-0027 THAT THE NATURAL SENTIMENTS ARISING FROM THE GENERAL APPEARANCES OF THINGS ARE EASILY DESTROYED BY SUBTILE REFLECTIONS CONCERNING THE MINUTE ORIGIN OF THESE APPEARANCES
8444-283136-0028 DOES NOT THE LIVELY CHEERFUL COLOUR OF A COUNTENANCE INSPIRE ME WITH COMPLACENCY AND PLEASURE EVEN THOUGH I LEARN FROM PHILOSOPHY THAT ALL DIFFERENCE OF COMPLEXION
8444-283136-0029 ARISES FROM THE MOST MINUTE DIFFERENCES OF THICKNESS IN THE MOST MINUTE PARTS OF THE SKIN
8444-283136-0030 TO REFLECT ONE OF THE ORIGINAL COLOURS OF LIGHT AND ABSORB THE OTHERS BUT THOUGH THE QUESTION CONCERNING THE UNIVERSAL OR PARTIAL SELFISHNESS OF MAN BE NOT SO MATERIAL
8444-283136-0031 AS IS USUALLY IMAGINED TO MORALITY AND PRACTICE IT IS CERTAINLY OF CONSEQUENCE IN THE SPECULATIVE SCIENCE OF HUMAN NATURE AND IS A PROPER OBJECT OF CURIOSITY AND ENQUIRY
8444-283136-0032 IT MAY NOT THEREFORE BE UNSUITABLE IN THIS PLACE TO BESTOW A FEW REFLECTIONS UPON IT FOOTNOTE
8444-283136-0033 BENEVOLENCE NATURALLY DIVIDES INTO TWO KINDS THE GENERAL AND THE PARTICULAR THE FIRST IS WHERE WE HAVE NO FRIENDSHIP OR CONNEXION OR ESTEEM FOR THE PERSON
8444-283136-0034 BUT FEEL ONLY A GENERAL SYMPATHY WITH HIM OR A COMPASSION FOR HIS PAINS AND A CONGRATULATION WITH HIS PLEASURES THE OTHER SPECIES OF BENEVOLENCE IS FOUNDED ON AN OPINION OF VIRTUE ON SERVICES DONE US
8444-283136-0035 OR ON SOME PARTICULAR CONNEXIONS BOTH THESE SENTIMENTS MUST BE ALLOWED REAL IN HUMAN NATURE BUT WHETHER THEY WILL RESOLVE INTO SOME NICE CONSIDERATIONS OF SELF LOVE
8444-283136-0036 IS A QUESTION MORE CURIOUS THAN IMPORTANT THE FORMER SENTIMENT TO WIT THAT OF GENERAL BENEVOLENCE OR HUMANITY OR SYMPATHY
8444-283136-0037 IN THE COURSE OF THIS INQUIRY
8444-283136-0038 GENERAL EXPERIENCE WITHOUT ANY OTHER PROOF THE MOST OBVIOUS OBJECTION TO THE SELFISH HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AS IT IS CONTRARY TO COMMON FEELING
8444-283136-0039 AND OUR MOST UNPREJUDICED NOTIONS THERE IS REQUIRED THE HIGHEST STRETCH OF PHILOSOPHY TO ESTABLISH SO EXTRAORDINARY A PARADOX
8444-283136-0040 TO THE MOST CARELESS OBSERVER THERE APPEAR TO BE SUCH DISPOSITIONS AS BENEVOLENCE AND GENEROSITY SUCH AFFECTIONS AS LOVE FRIENDSHIP COMPASSION GRATITUDE
8444-283136-0041 THESE SENTIMENTS HAVE THEIR CAUSES EFFECTS OBJECTS AND OPERATIONS MARKED BY COMMON LANGUAGE AND OBSERVATION
8444-283136-0042 AND PLAINLY DISTINGUISHED FROM THOSE OF THE SELFISH PASSIONS AND AS THIS IS THE OBVIOUS APPEARANCE OF THINGS IT MUST BE ADMITTED TILL SOME HYPOTHESIS BE DISCOVERED
8444-283136-0043 WHICH BY PENETRATING DEEPER INTO HUMAN NATURE MAY PROVE THE FORMER AFFECTIONS TO BE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE LATTER
8444-283136-0044 AND SEEM TO HAVE PROCEEDED ENTIRELY FROM THAT LOVE OF SIMPLICITY
8444-283136-0045 I SHALL NOT HERE ENTER INTO ANY DETAIL ON THE PRESENT SUBJECT MANY ABLE PHILOSOPHERS HAVE SHOWN THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THESE SYSTEMS AND I SHALL TAKE FOR GRANTED WHAT
8444-283136-0046 I BELIEVE THE SMALLEST REFLECTION WILL MAKE EVIDENT TO EVERY IMPARTIAL ENQUIRER BUT THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT FURNISHES THE STRONGEST PRESUMPTION THAT NO BETTER SYSTEM WILL EVER
8444-283136-0047 FOR THE FUTURE BE INVENTED IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ORIGIN OF THE BENEVOLENT FROM THE SELFISH AFFECTIONS
8444-283136-0048 TO A PERFECT SIMPLICITY THE CASE IS NOT THE SAME IN THIS SPECIES OF PHILOSOPHY AS IN PHYSICS MANY AN HYPOTHESIS IN NATURE CONTRARY TO FIRST APPEARANCES
8444-283136-0049 HAS BEEN FOUND ON MORE ACCURATE SCRUTINY SOLID AND SATISFACTORY INSTANCES OF THIS KIND ARE SO FREQUENT THAT A JUDICIOUS
8444-283136-0050 IF THERE BE MORE THAN ONE WAY IN WHICH ANY PHENOMENON MAY BE PRODUCED THAT THERE IS GENERAL PRESUMPTION FOR ITS ARISING FROM THE CAUSES WHICH ARE THE LEAST OBVIOUS AND FAMILIAR
8444-283136-0051 BUT THE PRESUMPTION ALWAYS LIES ON THE OTHER SIDE IN ALL ENQUIRIES CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF OUR PASSIONS AND OF THE INTERNAL OPERATIONS OF THE HUMAN MIND
8444-283136-0052 THE SIMPLEST AND MOST OBVIOUS CAUSE WHICH CAN THERE BE ASSIGNED FOR ANY PHENOMENON IS PROBABLY THE TRUE ONE WHEN A PHILOSOPHER IN THE EXPLICATION OF HIS SYSTEM
8444-283136-0053 IS OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SOME VERY INTRICATE AND REFINED REFLECTIONS AND TO SUPPOSE THEM ESSENTIAL TO THE PRODUCTION OF ANY PASSION OR EMOTION
8444-283136-0054 WE HAVE REASON TO BE EXTREMELY ON OUR GUARD AGAINST SO FALLACIOUS AN HYPOTHESIS THE AFFECTIONS ARE NOT SUSCEPTIBLE OF ANY IMPRESSION FROM THE REFINEMENTS OF REASON OR IMAGINATION
8444-283136-0055 AND IT IS ALWAYS FOUND THAT A VIGOROUS EXERTION OF THE LATTER FACULTIES NECESSARILY FROM THE NARROW CAPACITY OF THE HUMAN MIND DESTROYS ALL ACTIVITY IN THE FORMER
8444-283136-0056 OUR PREDOMINANT MOTIVE OR INTENTION IS INDEED FREQUENTLY CONCEALED FROM OURSELVES WHEN IT IS MINGLED AND CONFOUNDED WITH OTHER MOTIVES WHICH THE MIND
8444-283136-0057 FROM VANITY OR SELF CONCEIT IS DESIROUS OF SUPPOSING MORE PREVALENT BUT THERE IS NO INSTANCE THAT A CONCEALMENT OF THIS NATURE HAS EVER ARISEN FROM THE ABSTRUSENESS
8444-283136-0058 AND INTRICACY OF THE MOTIVE A MAN THAT HAS LOST A FRIEND AND PATRON MAY FLATTER HIMSELF THAT ALL HIS GRIEF ARISES FROM GENEROUS SENTIMENTS WITHOUT ANY MIXTURE OF NARROW
8444-283136-0059 OR INTERESTED CONSIDERATIONS BUT A MAN THAT GRIEVES FOR A VALUABLE FRIEND WHO NEEDED HIS PATRONAGE AND PROTECTION
8444-283136-0060 HOW CAN WE SUPPOSE THAT HIS PASSIONATE TENDERNESS ARISES FROM SOME METAPHYSICAL REGARDS TO A SELF INTEREST
8444-283136-0061 WE MAY AS WELL IMAGINE THAT MINUTE WHEELS AND SPRINGS LIKE THOSE OF A WATCH GIVE MOTION TO A LOADED WAGGON AS ACCOUNT FOR THE ORIGIN OF PASSION FROM SUCH ABSTRUSE REFLECTIONS
8444-283136-0062 ANIMALS ARE FOUND SUSCEPTIBLE OF KINDNESS BOTH TO THEIR OWN SPECIES AND TO OURS NOR IS THERE IN THIS CASE THE LEAST SUSPICION OF DISGUISE OR ARTIFICE
8444-283136-0063 SHALL WE ACCOUNT FOR ALL THEIR SENTIMENTS TOO FROM REFINED DEDUCTIONS OF SELF INTEREST OR IF WE ADMIT A DISINTERESTED BENEVOLENCE IN THE INFERIOR SPECIES
8444-283136-0064 BY WHAT RULE OF ANALOGY CAN WE REFUSE IT IN THE SUPERIOR LOVE BETWEEN THE SEXES BEGETS A COMPLACENCY AND GOOD WILL
8444-283136-0065 TENDERNESS TO THEIR OFFSPRING IN ALL SENSIBLE BEINGS
8444-283136-0066 AND HAS NO MANNER OF DEPENDANCE ON THAT AFFECTION WHAT INTEREST CAN A FOND MOTHER HAVE IN VIEW WHO LOSES HER HEALTH BY ASSIDUOUS ATTENDANCE ON HER SICK CHILD
8444-283136-0067 AND AFTERWARDS LANGUISHES AND DIES OF GRIEF WHEN FREED BY ITS DEATH FROM THE SLAVERY OF THAT ATTENDANCE IS GRATITUDE NO AFFECTION OF THE HUMAN BREAST
8444-283136-0068 OR IS THAT A WORD MERELY WITHOUT ANY MEANING OR REALITY HAVE WE NO SATISFACTION IN ONE MAN'S COMPANY ABOVE ANOTHER'S AND NO DESIRE OF THE WELFARE OF OUR FRIEND
8444-283136-0069 EVEN THOUGH ABSENCE OR DEATH SHOULD PREVENT US FROM ALL PARTICIPATION IN IT OR WHAT IS IT COMMONLY THAT GIVES US ANY PARTICIPATION IN IT EVEN WHILE ALIVE AND PRESENT
8444-283136-0070 BUT OUR AFFECTION AND REGARD TO HIM THESE AND A THOUSAND OTHER INSTANCES ARE MARKS OF A GENERAL BENEVOLENCE IN HUMAN NATURE WHERE NO REAL INTEREST
8444-283136-0071 BINDS US TO THE OBJECT AND HOW AN IMAGINARY INTEREST KNOWN AND AVOWED FOR SUCH CAN BE THE ORIGIN OF ANY PASSION OR EMOTION SEEMS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
8444-283136-0072 NO SATISFACTORY HYPOTHESIS OF THIS KIND HAS YET BEEN DISCOVERED NOR IS THERE THE SMALLEST PROBABILITY THAT THE FUTURE INDUSTRY OF MEN WILL EVER BE ATTENDED WITH MORE FAVOURABLE SUCCESS
8444-283136-0073 BUT FARTHER IF WE CONSIDER RIGHTLY OF THE MATTER WE SHALL FIND THAT THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH ALLOWS OF A DISINTERESTED BENEVOLENCE DISTINCT FROM SELF LOVE
8444-283136-0074 HAS REALLY MORE SIMPLICITY IN IT AND IS MORE CONFORMABLE TO THE ANALOGY OF NATURE THAN THAT WHICH PRETENDS TO RESOLVE ALL FRIENDSHIP AND HUMANITY INTO THIS LATTER PRINCIPLE
8444-283136-0075 WHICH NECESSARILY PRECEDE ALL SENSUAL ENJOYMENT AND CARRY US DIRECTLY TO SEEK POSSESSION OF THE OBJECT THUS HUNGER AND THIRST HAVE EATING AND DRINKING FOR THEIR END
8444-283136-0076 AND FROM THE GRATIFICATION OF THESE PRIMARY APPETITES ARISES A PLEASURE WHICH MAY BECOME THE OBJECT OF ANOTHER SPECIES OF DESIRE OR INCLINATION THAT IS SECONDARY AND INTERESTED
8444-283136-0077 IN THE SAME MANNER THERE ARE MENTAL PASSIONS BY WHICH WE ARE IMPELLED IMMEDIATELY TO SEEK PARTICULAR OBJECTS SUCH AS FAME OR POWER OR VENGEANCE WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO INTEREST
8444-283136-0078 AND WHEN THESE OBJECTS ARE ATTAINED A PLEASING ENJOYMENT ENSUES AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF OUR INDULGED AFFECTIONS NATURE MUST BY THE INTERNAL FRAME AND CONSTITUTION OF THE MIND
8444-283136-0079 GIVE AN ORIGINAL PROPENSITY TO FAME
8444-283136-0080 OR PURSUE IT FROM MOTIVES OF SELF LOVE AND DESIRE OF HAPPINESS IF I HAVE NO VANITY I TAKE NO DELIGHT IN PRAISE IF I BE VOID OF AMBITION
8444-283136-0081 POWER GIVES ME NO ENJOYMENT IF I BE NOT ANGRY THE PUNISHMENT OF AN ADVERSARY IS TOTALLY INDIFFERENT TO ME IN ALL THESE CASES
8444-283136-0082 AND CONSTITUTES IT OUR GOOD OR HAPPINESS AS THERE ARE OTHER SECONDARY PASSIONS WHICH AFTERWARDS ARISE AND PURSUE IT AS A PART OF OUR HAPPINESS
8444-283136-0083 WHEN ONCE IT IS CONSTITUTED SUCH BY OUR ORIGINAL AFFECTIONS WERE THERE NO APPETITE OF ANY KIND ANTECEDENT TO SELF LOVE
8444-283136-0084 THAT PROPENSITY COULD SCARCELY EVER EXERT ITSELF BECAUSE WE SHOULD IN THAT CASE HAVE FELT FEW AND SLENDER PAINS OR PLEASURES
8444-283136-0085 AND HAVE LITTLE MISERY OR HAPPINESS TO AVOID OR TO PURSUE NOW WHERE IS THE DIFFICULTY IN CONCEIVING THAT THIS MAY LIKEWISE BE THE CASE WITH BENEVOLENCE AND FRIENDSHIP
8444-283136-0086 AND THAT FROM THE ORIGINAL FRAME OF OUR TEMPER WE MAY FEEL A DESIRE OF ANOTHER'S HAPPINESS OR GOOD WHICH BY MEANS OF THAT AFFECTION BECOMES OUR OWN GOOD AND IS AFTERWARDS PURSUED
8444-283136-0087 FROM THE COMBINED MOTIVES OF BENEVOLENCE AND SELF ENJOYMENTS WHO SEES NOT THAT VENGEANCE FROM THE FORCE ALONE OF PASSION MAY BE SO EAGERLY PURSUED
8444-283136-0088 AS TO MAKE US KNOWINGLY NEGLECT EVERY CONSIDERATION OF EASE INTEREST OR SAFETY
8444-283136-0089 AND MAY BE A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR PARADOXICAL WIT AND RAILLERY
