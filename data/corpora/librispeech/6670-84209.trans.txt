6670-84209-0000 THE TASK OF GETTING THE MULES TOGETHER WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH THE IRRITABLE BEASTS MAKING THEIR USUAL OBJECTIONS BUT FOLLOWING THEIR OLD LEADER SKEETER QUIETLY ENOUGH IN SPITE OF THE BELL NOT BEING IN USE AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY WERE TRUDGING ALONG WITH THEIR LOADS DOWN THE STEEP SLOPE
6670-84209-0001 TILL THE GULCH WAS REACHED AND CHRIS CAME AFTER THEM WITH THE PONIES TO BRING HIS CHARGE TO A HALT LIKE TO CHANGE PLACES NED HE SAID ARCHLY NO I'M GOING TO DO MY PART WITHOUT THAT GOOD BYE CHRIS MY LAD SAID BOURNE SADLY
6670-84209-0002 I DON'T LIKE GOING OFF AND LEAVING YOU AND I DON'T LIKE YOU TO GO MISTER BOURNE SAID CHRIS HOLDING OUT HIS HAND WHICH WAS WARMLY GRASPED TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF NED YES AND YOU SAID THE BOY SADLY THE NEXT MINUTE CHRIS WAS STANDING BY HIS MUSTANG'S HEAD
6670-84209-0003 WATCHING THE MULES FILE AWAY LOOK AT THAT SAID CHRIS AS HE NOTED THAT HIS CHARGE DISPLAYED NO DESIRE TO FOLLOW THE MULES WHY IF THAT OLD SKEETER ISN'T ACTUALLY SNEERING AT MY PONIES HE DESERVES TO BE KICKED FOR HIS CONCEIT
6670-84209-0004 HID THE MULE TRAIN FROM SIGHT AND THEN CHRIS MOUNTED AND RODE TOWARDS THE POINTED ROCK CLOSE TO WHICH THE SPRING GURGLED OUT OF THE ROCK HERE HE TOOK THE PRECAUTION OF DRINKING DEEPLY HIMSELF BEFORE LETTING THE PONIES HAVE THEIR FILL OF THE REFRESHING WATER
6670-84209-0005 AFTER WHICH THEY BEGAN GRAZING IN THEIR QUIET INOFFENSIVE WAY LEAVING THEIR GUARDIAN TO HIS THOUGHTS WHICH WERE MANY AND TROUBLED IN THE FULL EXPECTATION OF HEARING SHOTS CHRIS SPENT PLENTY OF TIME IN LISTENING BUT NO REPORTS REACHED HIS EARS
6670-84209-0006 FROM THE WILD EXCITEMENT AND RISK OF HIS POSITION BY THE BARRIER
6670-84209-0007 TO THE SILENCE AND GRANDEUR OF THE DEEPLY CUT RIFT IN WHICH HE NOW STOOD FOR GLOOMY AND FORBIDDING AS THE PLACE LOOKED BY NIGHT EVEN AWFUL IN ITS BLACK SOLEMNITY IT WAS STRIKING ENOUGH NOW IN ITS EFFECTS OF BRILLIANT SUNSHINE AND SHADE
6670-84209-0008 TO MAKE THE BOY THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES HE HAD EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE WHAT A PITY HE MUTTERED AS HE LISTENED TO THE CROP CROP OF THE PONIES HE DID NOT SAY WHAT WAS A PITY
6670-84209-0009 FOR THE SHARP CRACK OF A RIFLE BROUGHT HIM OUT OF HIS MUSINGS TO GAZE SHARPLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BARRIER FAR AWAY FROM WHERE HE WAS WAITING AND WONDERING NOW WHETHER THERE WAS ANY MORE FIGHTING ON THE WAY ANOTHER SHARP CRACK AND CHRIS'S EXCITEMENT INCREASED
6670-84209-0010 AS HE FIRST LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT HIS CHARGES TO SEE IF THEY WERE STARTLED BY THE FIRING BUT THE PONIES DID NOT EVEN LIFT THEIR HEADS BUT WENT ON BROWSING UPON THE GREEN SHOOTS NEAR THE SPRING WHILE THE BOY INVOLUNTARILY DRAGGED HIS RIFLE ROUND
6670-84209-0011 READY TO THROW THE SLING OVER HIS HEAD IF THE NEED SPRANG UP FOR ITS USE BUT THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NO IMMEDIATE DANGER FOR QUITE AN HOUR PASSED BEFORE THERE WAS ANOTHER SHOT FIRED TO RAISE THE ECHOES AND THIS PROVED TO BE SINGLE
6670-84209-0012 A LONGER PERIOD ELAPSED BEFORE ANYTHING MORE OCCURRED AND TWICE AS LONG A TIME PASSED BEFORE THERE WAS ANOTHER IT'S JUST AS THEY SAID THOUGHT CHRIS A SHOT OR TWO JUST TO SHOW THE REDSKINS THAT WE'RE ON THE ALERT
6670-84209-0013 IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT CHRIS FANCIED THAT THE FAINTNESS FROM WHICH HE SUFFERED WAS DUE TO THE WANT OF FOOD AND OPENING HIS WALLET HE TOOK OUT A PIECE OF DAMPER TO FIND THAT IT ATE VERY SWEET WITH NOTHING BUT A FEW HANDFULS OF WATER TO WASH IT DOWN
6670-84209-0014 BY THE TIME THIS WAS FINISHED THE SUN HAD SUNK FAR BELOW THE ROCKS ON HIS LEFT AND THE DREAMY RESTFUL STATE INTO WHICH THE BOY HAD BEEN FALLING PASSED AWAY FOR THE THOUGHTS THAT CAME FAST NOW WERE BEGINNING TO GROW TROUBLOUS
6670-84209-0015 IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE IT WAS NIGHT AND WITH THE DARKNESS AN EXCITING TIME WOULD ARRIVE CHRIS THOUGHT THAT THE INDIANS WOULD NOT WAIT LONG BEFORE THEY ATTACKED AND A GREAT ANXIETY NOW OPPRESSED HIM WOULD HIS FATHER THINK OF THIS AND BE PREPARED
6670-84209-0016 OR WOULD HE WAIT TOO LONG AND THEN IT WAS TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF CHRIS ALL THROUGH THAT AFTERNOON HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM THE EFFECT OF HIS EXERTIONS AND HAD SUNK INTO A RESTFUL STATE A LONG WAY ON TO THE BORDER WHICH DIVIDES WAKEFULNESS FROM SLEEP
6670-84209-0017 BUT WITH THE COMING OF DARKNESS HIS BRAIN HAD BECOME ACTIVE TO A PAINFUL DEGREE AND BUT FOR THE STRINGENT ORDERS HE HAD RECEIVED TO BE PREPARED AND WAIT WITH THE PONIES HE WOULD HAVE GONE FORWARD SOUGHT HIS FATHER AND TOLD HIM OF HIS FEARS
6670-84209-0018 HE'S SURE TO KNOW BETTER THAN I DO CRIED THE BOY AT LAST TO COMFORT HIMSELF BUT WITH VERY POOR EFFECT AS HE KEPT HIS WATCH TILL THE DARKNESS HAD SEEMED TO SETTLE DOWN LIKE A FLOOD IN THE GULCH THE PONIES HAD BECOME INVISIBLE AND THE SKY HAD TURNED TO A DARK PURPLE
6670-84209-0019 HALF AN HOUR NOW PASSED AND THEN THE BOY'S AGONISED TENSION WAS BROKEN BY THREE SHOTS RINGING OUT ALMOST TOGETHER A VOLLEY HE SAID ALOUD AND THE WORDS HAD HARDLY PASSED HIS LIPS BEFORE THERE WAS A REPETITION OF THE REPORTS
6670-84209-0020 THE OTHER THREE BARRELS HE CRIED EXCITEDLY
6670-84209-0021 LOAD LOAD LOAD HE PANTED OH QUICK QUICK THEY'RE COMING ON
6670-84209-0022 INVENTED A HOST OF HORRORS CHIEF AMONG WHICH WAS THAT IN WHICH HE PICTURED TO HIMSELF THE INDIANS STEALING UP TO THE DEFENDERS OF THE BARRIER
6670-84209-0023 TO SPRING UPON THEM AND MASSACRE ALL BEFORE THEY COULD FIRE ANOTHER SHOT IN THEIR DEFENCE SO HORRIBLE BECAME THE SILENCE AT LAST THAT CHRIS FELT THAT IF IT LASTED MUCH LONGER HE MUST MOUNT HIS MUSTANG AND RIDE FORWARD TO LEARN THE WORST EVEN IF THEY KILL ME HE MUTTERED
6670-84209-0024 BUT THERE WAS THE SOUND OF HOOFS PASSING OVER THE STONY BOTTOM OF THE GULCH AND THE NEXT MINUTE CHRIS AND HIS FATHER EACH LEADING HIS PONY WERE WALKING TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE THE ANIMALS STEPPING INSTINCTIVELY IN THE FOOTPRINTS OF THOSE IN FRONT AND
6670-84209-0025 SAVING FOR THE FAINT SOUND OF TRAMPING THE SILENCE SEEMED TO THE BOY PERFECTLY AWFUL AT LAST CHRIS COULD KEEP BACK A QUESTION NO LONGER THE FIRING FATHER I HEARD TWO VOLLEYS WERE THE SAVAGES COMING ON
6670-84209-0026 NO BUT WE TREATED THEM AS IF THEY WERE JUST TO SHOW THEM THAT WE WERE WAITING FOR AN ATTACK
6670-84209-0027 THAT WILL BE THE SIGNAL FOR US TO MOUNT AND RIDE FOR OUR LIVES INDIANS ARE SWIFT OF FOOT BOY IT SEEMED AN HOUR DURING WHICH EVERY EAR WAS ON THE STRAIN BUT PROBABLY IT WAS NOT A FOURTH OF THAT TIME
6670-84209-0028 BEFORE THE FIERCE YELL OF THE SAVAGES WAS HEARD BUT IT ONLY REACHED THE FUGITIVES AS A FAINT WHISPER FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER FORTUNATELY THE RETIRING PARTY HAD REACHED WHERE THE GULCH HAD OPENED OUT AND QUITE A BROAD BAND OF BRILLIANT STARS
6670-84209-0029 GIVING SUFFICIENT LIGHT FOR THE PONIES TO FOLLOW ONE ANOTHER IN INDIAN FILE AT A GOOD ROUND TROT WHICH WAS KEPT UP HOUR AFTER HOUR WITH INTERVALS OF WALKING AND THE INDULGENCE NOW IN A LITTLE CONVERSATION REGARDING THE DISTANCE AHEAD OF THE MULE TRAIN
6670-84209-0030 OR THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS BEING MISSED BUT GRIGGS WAS POSITIVE NO HE SAID WE CAN'T HAVE OVER RUN THEM BUT HAVE THEY TURNED OFF SOMEWHERE I DON'T REMEMBER ANY SIDE VALLEY BUT WE MAY HAVE PASSED ONE NO WE MAYN'T SIR
6670-84209-0031 SAID GRIGGS COOLLY WE DON'T KNOW IT AT LEAST I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU DID FOR I FANCY I DO BUT IF THE MULES HAD TURNED OFF ANYWHERE OUR CLEVER MUSTANGS WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THEY'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE MULES TRAIL EVER SINCE WE STARTED WHAT
6670-84209-0032 IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS DARKNESS THINK SO SIR WELL SUPPOSE YOU WAIT AND SEE THERE WAS SILENCE FOR AWHILE
6670-84209-0033 NO SIR I'VE LISTENED TILL IT HAS GIVEN ME A FEELING LIKE TOOTHACHE DO YOU THINK THEY ARE ON OUR TRAIL AH
6670-84209-0034 BECAUSE THEY'LL BE AS INDIANS MOSTLY ARE WHEN THEY CAN'T SEE THEIR QUARRY HORRIBLY SUSPICIOUS OF BEING LED INTO AN AMBUSH THEY DID NOT SEEM SO WHEN THEY FOLLOWED YOU NO THEY COULD SEE ME AND THEY FORGOT TO BE IN DOUBT IN THE HEAT OF THE PURSUIT BUT ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS
6670-84209-0035 THEY ARE BOUND TO FEEL THEIR WAY STEP BY STEP IF THEY FOLLOW AT ALL MOST LIKELY THEY'LL WAIT TILL MORNING WHEN THEY'LL PICK UP OUR TRAIL AND THEN COME ON AS FAST AS THEY CAN RUN SIR THEY WON'T RIDE GRIGGS FINISHED OFF WITH A LOUD CHUCKLE
6670-84209-0036 SAY CHRIS HE ADDED WON'T THEY BE MAD AT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT THEIR PONIES I SUPPOSE SO SAID CHRIS BUT THERE'S A GOOD SIDE TO EVERYTHING IT'LL BE GRAND FOR THE POOR BEASTS THEY'RE RIDDEN NEARLY TO DEATH NOW THEY'LL HAVE A GOOD REST WITH PLENTY OF FINE PASTURE
6670-84209-0037 BUT ABOUT TO MORROW GRIGGS SAID CHRIS WHAT ABOUT TO MORROW THE INDIANS MAY FOLLOW US AND OVERTAKE US ON FOOT WELL IF THEY DO THEY DO MY LAD AND AT THE VERY WORST THEY MAY CAPTURE SOME OF OUR STORES BUT PERHAPS NOT
6670-84209-0038 I DON'T LIKE BEING A BRUTE TO A DUMB BEAST BUT IF I'M DRIVEN TO IT I MAY HAVE TO BE A BIT HARD TO SOME OF THOSE MULES THEY CAN GO SO FAST THAT NO INDIAN CAN CATCH THEM IF THEY LIKE YES WELL AS A RULE THEY DON'T LIKE
6670-84209-0039 THAT'S THE WORST OF IT SAID CHRIS YES BUT THIS TIME THEY'VE GOT TO LIKE AND I KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM DAYBREAK AT LAST AND WITH THAT DAWN ALL DOUBTS ABOUT THE MULE CONVOY WERE AT AN END FOR THE FIRST STREAKS OF DAWN SHOWED THEM ABOUT A MILE AHEAD
6670-84209-0040 NOT EVEN THE RISING OF THE SUN REVEALED THAT FOR WHICH A MOST ANXIOUS LOOKOUT WAS KEPT NAMELY SO MANY DARK DOTS TO INDICATE THAT THE INDIANS WERE ON THEIR TRAIL
