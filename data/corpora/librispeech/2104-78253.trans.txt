2104-78253-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN A GREAT ACTOR LAST TIME I WAS AT CASTELLINARIA THERE CAME TO THE TOWN FOR A WEEK A COMPANY OF SICILIAN ACTORS I WAS AFRAID THE DIALECT WOULD BE BEYOND ME BUT PEPPINO ASSURED ME THAT IT WOULD MATTER VERY LITTLE IF IT WERE
2104-78253-0001 BECAUSE I SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE GESTURES
2104-78253-0002 SO WE WENT TO THE THEATRE THE FIRST EVENING HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE GESTURES WHICH WERE WONDERFULLY EXPRESSIVE AND AS FOR THE DIALECT IT MAY HAVE BEEN BECAUSE HE INTERPRETED THE LONG SPEECHES
2104-78253-0003 HE ADMITTED THAT IT WAS SO BUT THINGS WOULD IMPROVE AS SOON AS GIOVANNI APPEARED IN THE THIRD ACT A HAGGARD HUNTED CREATURE IN A PEASANT'S DRESS WHICH HE HAD BORROWED OR STOLEN WANDERED IN AMONG THE ACTORS
2104-78253-0004 PEPPINO WHISPERED THAT HE HAD ESCAPED FROM PRISON I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF HIM EVERY MOVEMENT EVERY ATTITUDE EVERY GESTURE WAS FULL OF BEAUTY NOBILITY AND SIGNIFICANCE AND HIS VOICE WAS A HALO OF ROMANCE
2104-78253-0005 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT LEAVING THE THEATRE THE PART HAS BEEN PLAYED BY MANY FAMOUS ACTORS BUT THE LONG ACCOUNT OF HOW AND WHY HE KILLED HIS MAN CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN MORE FINELY DELIVERED I SAW HIM DO THE DEED
2104-78253-0006 I SAW HIM TURN AND GAZE UPON THE BODY WHILE HE WIPED THE BLOOD OFF THE KNIFE AND WRUNG IT FROM HIS HANDS HE SAT ON A CHAIR DURING THE WHOLE SPEECH AND I WAS SURPRISED INTO BELIEVING I UNDERSTOOD EVERY WORD WHEREAS I UNDERSTOOD NONE
2104-78253-0007 FOR IT WAS ALL IN THE DIALECT OF CATANIA AND PEPPINO WHO WAS AS MUCH CARRIED AWAY AS I WAS FORGOT TO INTERPRET AND WHEN STILL SITTING ON HIS CHAIR HE CAME TO HIS ESCAPE FROM PRISON HE SEEMED TO LIFT THE ROOF OFF THE THEATRE
2104-78253-0008 AND TO FILL THE PLACE WITH FREEDOM AND FRESH AIR PEPPINO BEFORE HIS UNCLE DIED THOUGHT OF GOING ON THE STAGE AND PASSED A YEAR WITH GIOVANNI AND HIS COMPANY IN CATANIA AND ON TOUR HE THEREFORE KNEW HIM QUITE WELL AND AT THE END OF THE PLAY TOOK ME ROUND TO HIS DRESSING ROOM
2104-78253-0009 IT WAS CARLO MAGNO IN HIS PALACE RECEIVING A COUPLE OF FRIENDLY SOVEREIGNS THOUGH WE WERE NONE OF US DRESSED FOR OUR PARTS I TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE GREATEST DRAMATIC ARTIST I HAD EVER SEEN
2104-78253-0010 I SAID THAT WHEN HE FIRST APPEARED I THOUGHT HE REALLY WAS AN ESCAPED CONVICT WHO HAD LOST HIS WAY IN THE STREETS AND COME ON THE STAGE FOR SHELTER AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO INTERRUPT THE PLAY AS THE THEATRE CAT SOMETIMES DOES
2104-78253-0011 SUDDENLY IN A FLASH I SAW WHAT WAS BEFORE ME IN TWO SENSES AT ONCE AND KNEW THAT IT MUST BE GIOVANNI ACTING AND THE SORROW FOR THE POOR HUNTED WRETCH WAS TURNED TO JOY AT SEEING A MAN DO SOMETHING SUPREMELY WELL HE WAS AS PLEASED AS A BOY WITH A NEW HALF SOVEREIGN
2104-78253-0012 PARTICULARLY WHEN I COMPARED HIM TO THE THEATRE CAT AND SAID WITH CHARMING SIMPLICITY THANK YOU YES THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE REALISM THAT IS MY ART PEPPINO AND I SAT UP LATE THAT NIGHT TALKING ABOUT HIM
2104-78253-0013 HE WAS THEN ABOUT THIRTY FIVE WITH A LARGE REPERTOIRE AND A REPUTATION EXTENDING THROUGH EUROPE AND AMERICA WHEN HE WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN HIS FATHER WHO OWNED AND WORKED THE MOST FAMOUS MARIONETTE THEATRE IN CATANIA DIED SUDDENLY LEAVING THE FAMILY UNPROVIDED FOR
2104-78253-0014 HE TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS AND KEPT HIS MOTHER HIS SISTER AND HIS YOUNG BROTHER HE SPOKE FOR THE MEN FIGURES HIMSELF AND HIS SISTER FOR THE WOMEN HE SAYS THAT IN THIS WAY HE LEARNED HIS ART BUT OTHER MEN HAVE HAD SIMILAR TRAINING WITHOUT ARRIVING AT SUCH MASTERY
2104-78253-0015 HE HAS A PASSION FOR DOING THINGS THOROUGHLY AND SO THOROUGHLY WELL DID HE MANAGE HIS THEATRE THAT CATANIA WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIM THREE OR FOUR YEARS AFTER HIS FATHER'S DEATH ONE OF THE CELEBRATED ITALIAN ACTORS CAME TO THE TOWN
2104-78253-0016 AND THEY GAVE HIM A PRIVATE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA THE CELEBRATED ACTOR ADVISED HIM NOT TO WASTE HIS TIME WITH MARIONETTES BUT TO ACT HIMSELF THE THEATRE WAS BARELY LARGE ENOUGH ONLY SIX OR SEVEN PACES ACROSS BUT IT COULD BE MADE TO DO
2104-78253-0017 AND HE FOLLOWED THE ADVICE GIVING AT FIRST IN THE CATANIAN DIALECT PLAYS OF WHICH NOTHING WAS WRITTEN EXCEPT PERHAPS A SKETCH OF THE PLOT FORMERLY WHEN READING WAS A RARER ACCOMPLISHMENT THAN IT IS NOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OF LITTLE USE TO WRITE THE WORDS
2104-78253-0018 THESE PLAYS ARE FULL OF VIOLENCE AND VENDETTA JEALOUSY MURDER AND THE ELEMENTARY PASSIONS THE AUDIENCE ARE UNEDUCATED SIMPLE PEOPLE WHO LOOK FOR THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
2104-78253-0019 AS CHILDREN LOVE THE SAME STORY AND RESENT ANY RADICAL CHANGE THIS MAKES IT EASIER TO CARRY ONE THROUGH THAN IT WOULD BE IF SUBTLETIES OR MUCH NOVELTY WERE TO BE ATTEMPTED I HAD SEEN SOME OF THESE PLAYS IN CATANIA
2104-78253-0020 AND IT MAY MAKE MATTERS CLEARER TO GIVE A SHORT ACCOUNT OF ONE IT WAS NOT UNTIL PEPPINO TOLD ME ABOUT THEM THAT I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORDS WERE IMPROVISED IN THE FIRST ACT PIETRO LONGO DISCOVERS THAT HIS SISTER HAS BEEN BETRAYED
2104-78253-0021 SHOOTS HER SEDUCER AND IS TAKEN BY THE POLICE THE SECOND ACT PASSES IN PRISON TWO CONVICTS ARE TALKING AND A THIRD A STUPID FELLOW OLD DIRTY ONLY HALF CLOTHED IS SITTING APART STITCHING TOGETHER A FEW MORE RAGS
2104-78253-0022 SINGING IS HEARD WITHOUT EVERY ONE IN THE THEATRE WHO HAD PASSED UNDER PRISON WALLS BY NIGHT HAD HEARD SUCH MUSIC AND HAD SEEN THE SINGERS CROUCHING IN THE SHADOWS WE ALL KNEW IT WAS A SIGNAL THE TWO CONVICTS GO TO THE WINDOW AND REPLY
2104-78253-0023 A STONE IS THROWN IN WRAPPED UP IN A LETTER WHICH TELLS THEM THAT PIETRO LONGO HAS KILLED ONE OF THEIR GANG AND WILL BE TAKEN TO THEIR PRISON IT IS FOR THEM TO AVENGE THE MURDER THEY CONFER AND AGREE THAT THE STUPID FELLOW SHALL BE THEIR INSTRUMENT
2104-78253-0024 THEY CALL HIM FROM HIS OCCUPATION AND INSTRUCT HIM THEY TELL HIM THAT A PRISONER WILL BE BROUGHT IN HE IS TO ASK HIS NAME IF HE REPLIES PIETRO LONGO HE IS TO STAB HIM WITH THE KNIFE WHICH THEY GIVE HIM HE IS SO STUPID THAT THEY HAVE TO ACT IT FOR HIM
2104-78253-0025 AND TO MAKE HIM IMITATE THEM TILL THEY THINK HE CAN BE TRUSTED THEY HIDE A PRISONER IS BROUGHT IN AND TALKS TO THE STUPID FELLOW
2104-78253-0026 IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR INTENTION FOR HE HAS FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT HIS LESSON HE ASKS THE PRISONER HIS NAME PIETRO LONGO THE STUPID FELLOW REMEMBERS THAT THIS IS HIS CUE FOR DOING SOMETHING BUT CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT
2104-78253-0027 HIS ARM ACCIDENTALLY HITS THE KNIFE WHICH IS STUCK IN HIS BELT OF COURSE THIS IS THE PRISONER HE IS TO KILL HE TAKES OUT HIS KNIFE OPENS IT WITH HIS TEETH AND ATTACKS PIETRO WHO THOUGH UNARMED IS ABLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF
2104-78253-0028 THIS PUTS THE STUPID FELLOW OUT HE WAS TOLD NOTHING ABOUT THE PRISONER DEFENDING HIMSELF THE TWO CONVICTS WHO HAVE BEEN WATCHING GET IMPATIENT COME FROM THEIR HIDING AND ENCOURAGE HIM THIS MAKES MATTERS WORSE HE WAS TOLD NOTHING ABOUT THIS EITHER
2104-78253-0029 HE IS IRRITATED HE GROWS WILDER AND IN A FURY SUDDENLY TURNS FROM PIETRO AND MURDERS THE TWO CONVICTS INSTEAD THE TWO ACTS WERE OF ABOUT EQUAL LENGTH THE FIRST EXISTED MERELY TO INTRODUCE THE SECOND
2104-78253-0030 AND THE SECOND MERELY TO INTRODUCE THE STUPID FELLOW WHOSE PART WAS NEARLY ALL GESTURE AND AS I AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WAS TAKEN BY GIOVANNI'S BROTHER DOMENICO HE MAY HAVE SPOKEN TWENTY WORDS HE WAS TOO STUPID TO SPEAK MORE
2104-78253-0031 THE OTHERS SPOKE A GOOD DEAL BUT EXCEPT THAT THEY HAD BEEN TOLD BEFOREHAND AS TO EACH ACT ABOUT AS MUCH AS THE READER HAS BEEN TOLD ABOUT THE SECOND ALL THEY SAID WAS IMPROMPTU SO THAT EACH REPETITION LIKE A JAPANESE NETSUKE WOULD BE A UNIQUE WORK OF ART
2104-78253-0032 REMEMBERING HOW CONTINUALLY SICILIANS USE GESTURE IN ORDINARY LIFE IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT IN SUCH A PLAY THE ACTUAL WORDS ARE OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE
2104-78253-0033 GIOVANNI IN WORKING THE MARIONETTES HAD BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE TYPES THAT IN DIFFERENT GRADES OF SOCIETY REAPPEAR IN ALL PLAYS THE GOOD KING THE PROUD TYRANT THE TRAITOR THE FAITHFUL FRIEND
2104-78253-0034 WHICH ARE EXCEPTIONAL WITH THE SICILIAN MARIONETTES HIS MEMORY HAD BECOME STORED WITH CONVENTIONAL PHRASES SUITABLE FOR ALL THE USUAL STAGE EMERGENCIES AND ALWAYS READY FOR IMPROMPTU DELIVERY HIS FELLOW ACTORS WERE ALSO FAMILIAR WITH THEM
2104-78253-0035 HAVING HEARD THE PHRASES OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND SEEN THE TYPES WITH THEIR APPROPRIATE GESTURES FROM THEIR EARLY YOUTH AS MEMBERS OF THE MARIONETTE AUDIENCE IT IS CLAIMED FOR THIS KIND OF IMPROMPTU ACTING
2104-78253-0036 THAT THE ACTORS ARE FREER THAN WHEN SPEAKING WORDS THEY HAVE LEARNT AND CAN THEREFORE BEHAVE WITH MORE NATURALNESS
2104-78253-0037 AND RECITING ONE THAT HAS BEEN LEARNT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECITARE A SOGGETTO
2104-78253-0038 SO GREAT IS THE FREEDOM THAT AN ACTOR MAY INTRODUCE ANYTHING APPROPRIATE THAT OCCURS TO HIM AT THE MOMENT AND THE OTHERS MUST BE READY TO FALL IN WITH IT
2104-78253-0039 OUTSIDE THE THEATRE WHEN AN OLD BEGGAR STOPPED TO BEG HE HAD COME A LONG WAY HE KNEW NO ONE IN THE TOWN HE HAD NOTHING TO EAT NOWHERE TO SLEEP NO MONEY THE MOTHER GAVE HIM A PENNY GIOVANNI GAVE HIM ANOTHER HIS BROTHER DOMENICO ANOTHER
2104-78253-0040 EVERY ONE GAVE SOMETHING THE BEGGAR SEEING ALL THAT WEALTH LYING IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND AND KNOWING THAT HE WAS NOW SAFE FOR A FEW DAYS BURST INTO TEARS AND TURNED AWAY SPEECHLESS AT THE SIGHT OF THIS DOMENICO CALLED TO HIM
2104-78253-0041 WENT AFTER HIM MET HIM EMPTIED HIS POCKETS GAVE HIM ALL HE HAD TOOK HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS KISSED HIM ON BOTH CHEEKS DISMISSED HIM RETURNED TO HIS FAMILY AND WAS RECEIVED WITH AN APPROVAL THAT WAS TOO DEEP FOR WORDS
2104-78253-0042 SUCH AN IMPROVISED INCIDENT THE SUDDEN OUTCOME OF UNCONTROLLABLE EMOTION MAY BE SEEN ANY DAY IN SICILY AND MIGHT BE INTRODUCED ANY EVENING INTO ONE OF THESE UNWRITTEN PLAYS BY ANY ACTOR WHO SHOULD TAKE IT INTO HIS HEAD TO DO IT
2104-78253-0043 THE AUDIENCE WHO WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SEEN THE PLAY BEFORE WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT HERE WAS AN IMPROMPTU INTERPOLATION AND WOULD APPLAUD THE ACTOR BOTH FOR THE IDEA AND FOR THE WAY IT WAS CARRIED OUT
2104-78253-0044 GRADUALLY GIOVANNI ADDED WRITTEN PLAYS AND A PROMPTER AND WAS THE FIRST TO TAKE ON TOUR A COMPANY OF ACTORS PERFORMING IN A SICILIAN DIALECT HE ALSO INCLUDED PLAYS WRITTEN IN ITALIAN THESE WRITTEN PLAYS THOUGH CONSTRUCTED WITH MORE CARE
2104-78253-0045 DID NOT DEPART FAR FROM THE STYLE WITH WHICH HE BEGAN GIOVANNI STILL FREQUENTLY RETURNS FROM PRISON BUT AS HE NEVER FORFEITS THE SYMPATHY OF THE AUDIENCE IF HE REALLY COMMITTED THE CRIME IT WAS IN SELF DEFENCE
2104-78253-0046 WHATEVER THE PLAY MAY BE IT ALWAYS CONTAINS BESIDES THE INEVITABLE SCENES OF VIOLENCE MANY OTHER PASSAGES SUCH AS HEARING A LETTER READ HE IS THEN A SIMPLE FELLOW WHO CANNOT READ
2104-78253-0047 HE IS THEN DEEPLY RELIGIOUS DANCING AT A FESTA HE IS A PERFECT DANCER CONFIDING WITH HIS LAST BREATH THE NAME OF HIS MURDERER TO HIS YOUNG BROTHER
2104-78253-0048 IN THESE PASSAGES HIS HUMOUR HIS DELICACY HIS GRACE HIS TENDERNESS HIS VOICE AND MOST WONDERFUL OF ALL HIS APPARENTLY INTENSE BELIEF IN THE REALITY OF EVERYTHING HE SAYS AND DOES
2104-78253-0049 MAKE ONE FORGET HOW CRUDE AND TRANSPONTINE THE BARE THEME IS ON MY SAYING I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF HIM PEPPINO ASKED WHY I HAD COME AWAY SO SOON
2104-78253-0050 NEVER IS HE ALONE SAID PEPPINO SURELY NOW SHALL HE BE SUPPERING BY HIS FRIENDS
