6196-41030-0000 THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN UPON THEM TO LAY DOWN THE LAW OF NATURE AS A THING ALREADY SEARCHED OUT AND UNDERSTOOD
6196-41030-0001 FOR AS THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN INDUCING BELIEF SO THEY HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN QUENCHING AND STOPPING INQUIRY AND HAVE DONE MORE HARM BY SPOILING AND PUTTING AN END TO OTHER MEN'S EFFORTS
6196-41030-0002 THAN GOOD BY THEIR OWN THOSE ON THE OTHER HAND WHO HAVE TAKEN A CONTRARY COURSE AND ASSERTED THAT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING CAN BE KNOWN WHETHER IT WERE FROM HATRED OF THE ANCIENT SOPHISTS OR FROM
6196-41030-0003 UNCERTAINTY AND FLUCTUATION OF MIND OR EVEN FROM A KIND OF FULNESS OF LEARNING THAT THEY FELL UPON THIS OPINION HAVE CERTAINLY ADVANCED REASONS FOR IT THAT ARE NOT TO BE DESPISED BUT YET
6196-41030-0004 THEY HAVE NEITHER STARTED FROM TRUE PRINCIPLES NOR RESTED IN THE JUST CONCLUSION ZEAL AND AFFECTATION HAVING CARRIED THEM MUCH TOO FAR THE MORE ANCIENT OF THE GREEKS WHOSE WRITINGS ARE LOST
6196-41030-0005 A POSITION BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES
6196-41030-0006 AND THE DESPAIR OF COMPREHENDING ANYTHING
6196-41030-0007 AND THE OBSCURITY OF THINGS AND LIKE IMPATIENT HORSES CHAMPING THE BIT
6196-41030-0008 THINKING IT SEEMS THAT THIS VERY QUESTION VIZ WHETHER OR NO ANYTHING CAN BE KNOWN
6196-41030-0009 BUT BY TRYING AND YET THEY TOO
6196-41030-0010 BUT MADE EVERYTHING TURN UPON HARD THINKING AND PERPETUAL WORKING AND EXERCISE OF THE MIND NOW MY METHOD
6196-41030-0011 AND IT IS THIS I PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH PROGRESSIVE STAGES OF CERTAINTY THE EVIDENCE OF THE SENSE HELPED AND GUARDED BY A CERTAIN PROCESS OF CORRECTION I RETAIN
6196-41030-0012 BUT THE MENTAL OPERATION WHICH FOLLOWS THE ACT OF SENSE I FOR THE MOST PART REJECT AND INSTEAD OF IT I OPEN AND LAY OUT A NEW AND CERTAIN PATH FOR THE MIND TO PROCEED IN
6196-41030-0013 STARTING DIRECTLY FROM THE SIMPLE SENSUOUS PERCEPTION THE NECESSITY OF THIS WAS FELT NO DOUBT BY THOSE WHO ATTRIBUTED SO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO LOGIC SHOWING THEREBY
6196-41030-0014 THAT THEY WERE IN SEARCH OF HELPS FOR THE UNDERSTANDING AND HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN THE NATIVE AND SPONTANEOUS PROCESS OF THE MIND BUT THIS REMEDY COMES TOO LATE TO DO ANY GOOD
6196-41030-0015 WHEN THE MIND IS ALREADY THROUGH THE DAILY INTERCOURSE AND CONVERSATION OF LIFE
6196-41030-0016 AND BESET ON ALL SIDES BY VAIN IMAGINATIONS AND THEREFORE THAT ART OF LOGIC COMING AS I SAID TOO LATE TO THE RESCUE AND NO WAY ABLE TO SET MATTERS RIGHT AGAIN
6196-41030-0017 HAS HAD THE EFFECT OF FIXING ERRORS RATHER THAN DISCLOSING TRUTH THERE REMAINS BUT ONE COURSE FOR THE RECOVERY OF A SOUND AND HEALTHY CONDITION NAMELY
6196-41030-0018 THAT THE ENTIRE WORK OF THE UNDERSTANDING BE COMMENCED AFRESH AND THE MIND ITSELF BE FROM THE VERY OUTSET NOT LEFT TO TAKE ITS OWN COURSE BUT GUIDED AT EVERY STEP AND THE BUSINESS BE DONE
6196-41030-0019 AS IF BY MACHINERY CERTAINLY IF IN THINGS MECHANICAL MEN HAD SET TO WORK WITH THEIR NAKED HANDS
6196-41030-0020 VERY SMALL WOULD THE MATTERS HAVE BEEN WHICH EVEN WITH THEIR BEST EFFORTS APPLIED IN CONJUNCTION THEY COULD HAVE ATTEMPTED OR ACCOMPLISHED NOW TO PAUSE WHILE UPON THIS EXAMPLE
6196-41030-0021 AND LOOK IN IT AS IN A GLASS LET US SUPPOSE THAT SOME VAST OBELISK WERE FOR THE DECORATION OF A TRIUMPH OR SOME SUCH MAGNIFICENCE TO BE REMOVED FROM ITS PLACE
6196-41030-0022 AND THAT MEN SHOULD SET TO WORK UPON IT WITH THEIR NAKED HANDS WOULD NOT ANY SOBER SPECTATOR THINK THEM MAD AND IF THEY SHOULD THEN SEND FOR MORE PEOPLE THINKING THAT IN THAT WAY THEY MIGHT MANAGE IT
6196-41030-0023 WOULD HE NOT THINK THEM ALL THE MADDER AND IF THEY THEN PROCEEDED TO MAKE A SELECTION PUTTING AWAY THE WEAKER HANDS AND USING ONLY THE STRONG AND VIGOROUS WOULD HE NOT THINK THEM MADDER THAN EVER
6196-41030-0024 AND IF LASTLY NOT CONTENT WITH THIS THEY RESOLVED TO CALL IN AID THE ART OF ATHLETICS AND REQUIRED ALL THEIR MEN TO COME WITH HANDS ARMS AND SINEWS WELL ANOINTED AND MEDICATED
6196-41030-0025 ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF ART WOULD HE NOT CRY OUT THAT THEY WERE
6196-41030-0026 YET JUST SO IT IS THAT MEN PROCEED IN MATTERS INTELLECTUAL WITH JUST THE SAME KIND OF MAD EFFORT AND USELESS COMBINATION OF FORCES WHEN THEY HOPE GREAT THINGS
6196-41030-0027 EITHER FROM THE NUMBER AND COOPERATION OR FROM THE EXCELLENCY AND ACUTENESS OF INDIVIDUAL WITS YEA AND WHEN THEY ENDEAVOUR BY LOGIC WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A KIND OF ATHLETIC ART
6196-41030-0028 TO STRENGTHEN THE SINEWS OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND YET WITH ALL THIS STUDY AND ENDEAVOUR IT IS APPARENT TO ANY TRUE JUDGMENT
6196-41030-0029 WHEREAS IN EVERY GREAT WORK TO BE DONE BY THE HAND OF MAN IT IS MANIFESTLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT INSTRUMENTS OR MACHINERY EITHER FOR THE STRENGTH OF EACH TO BE EXERTED OR THE STRENGTH OF ALL TO BE UNITED
6196-41030-0030 UPON THESE PREMISES TWO THINGS OCCUR TO ME OF WHICH THAT THEY MAY NOT BE OVERLOOKED I WOULD HAVE MEN REMINDED FIRST IT FALLS OUT FORTUNATELY AS I THINK
6196-41030-0031 FOR THE ALLAYING OF CONTRADICTIONS AND HEART BURNINGS THAT THE HONOUR AND REVERENCE DUE TO THE ANCIENTS REMAINS UNTOUCHED AND UNDIMINISHED
6196-41030-0032 WHILE I MAY CARRY OUT MY DESIGNS AND AT THE SAME TIME REAP THE FRUIT OF MY MODESTY FOR IF I SHOULD PROFESS THAT I
6196-41030-0033 THERE MUST NEEDS HAVE BEEN SOME COMPARISON OR RIVALRY BETWEEN US NOT TO BE AVOIDED BY ANY ART OF WORDS IN RESPECT OF EXCELLENCY OR ABILITY OF WIT
6196-41030-0034 AND THOUGH IN THIS THERE WOULD BE NOTHING UNLAWFUL OR NEW FOR IF THERE BE ANYTHING MISAPPREHENDED BY THEM OR FALSELY LAID DOWN WHY MAY NOT I USING A LIBERTY COMMON TO ALL
6196-41030-0035 TAKE EXCEPTION TO IT YET THE CONTEST HOWEVER JUST AND ALLOWABLE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN UNEQUAL ONE PERHAPS IN RESPECT OF THE MEASURE OF MY OWN POWERS AS IT IS HOWEVER
6196-41030-0036 MY OBJECT BEING TO OPEN A NEW WAY FOR THE UNDERSTANDING A WAY BY THEM UNTRIED AND UNKNOWN THE CASE IS ALTERED PARTY ZEAL AND EMULATION ARE AT AN END AND I APPEAR
6196-41030-0037 MERELY AS A GUIDE TO POINT OUT THE ROAD AN OFFICE OF SMALL AUTHORITY
6196-41030-0038 AND THUS MUCH RELATES TO THE PERSONS ONLY THE OTHER POINT OF WHICH I WOULD HAVE MEN REMINDED RELATES TO THE MATTER ITSELF BE IT REMEMBERED THEN
6196-41030-0039 THAT I AM FAR FROM WISHING TO INTERFERE WITH THE PHILOSOPHY WHICH NOW FLOURISHES OR WITH ANY OTHER PHILOSOPHY MORE CORRECT AND COMPLETE THAN THIS WHICH HAS BEEN OR MAY HEREAFTER BE PROPOUNDED
6196-41030-0040 FOR I DO NOT OBJECT TO THE USE OF THIS RECEIVED PHILOSOPHY OR OTHERS LIKE IT
6196-41030-0041 OR ORNAMENTS FOR DISCOURSE FOR THE PROFESSOR'S LECTURE AND FOR THE BUSINESS OF LIFE NAY MORE I DECLARE OPENLY THAT FOR THESE USES THE PHILOSOPHY WHICH I BRING FORWARD WILL NOT BE MUCH AVAILABLE
6196-41030-0042 IT DOES NOT LIE IN THE WAY IT CANNOT BE CAUGHT UP IN PASSAGE IT DOES NOT FLATTER THE UNDERSTANDING BY CONFORMITY WITH PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS NOR WILL IT COME DOWN TO THE APPREHENSION OF THE VULGAR
6196-41030-0043 EXCEPT BY ITS UTILITY AND EFFECTS LET THERE BE THEREFORE AND MAY IT BE FOR THE BENEFIT OF BOTH TWO STREAMS AND TWO DISPENSATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE AND IN LIKE MANNER
6196-41030-0044 TWO TRIBES OR KINDREDS OF STUDENTS IN PHILOSOPHY TRIBES NOT HOSTILE OR ALIEN TO EACH OTHER BUT BOUND TOGETHER BY MUTUAL SERVICES
6196-41030-0045 LET THERE IN SHORT BE ONE METHOD FOR THE CULTIVATION ANOTHER FOR THE INVENTION OF KNOWLEDGE AND FOR THOSE WHO PREFER THE FORMER EITHER FROM HURRY OR FROM CONSIDERATIONS OF BUSINESS
6196-41030-0046 OR FOR WANT OF MENTAL POWER TO TAKE IN AND EMBRACE THE OTHER WHICH MUST NEEDS BE MOST MEN'S CASE I WISH THAT THEY MAY SUCCEED TO THEIR DESIRE IN WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT AND OBTAIN WHAT THEY ARE PURSUING
6196-41030-0047 BUT IF ANY MAN THERE BE WHO NOT CONTENT TO REST IN AND USE THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCOVERED
6196-41030-0048 NOT AN ADVERSARY IN ARGUMENT BUT NATURE IN ACTION TO SEEK NOT PRETTY AND PROBABLE CONJECTURES BUT CERTAIN AND DEMONSTRABLE KNOWLEDGE
6196-41030-0049 I INVITE ALL SUCH TO JOIN THEMSELVES AS TRUE SONS OF KNOWLEDGE WITH ME THAT PASSING BY THE OUTER COURTS OF NATURE WHICH NUMBERS HAVE TRODDEN
6196-41030-0050 WE MAY FIND A WAY AT LENGTH INTO HER INNER CHAMBERS AND TO MAKE MY MEANING CLEARER
6196-41030-0051 I HAVE CHOSEN TO CALL ONE OF THESE METHODS OR WAYS ANTICIPATION OF THE MIND THE OTHER INTERPRETATION OF NATURE MOREOVER I HAVE ONE REQUEST TO MAKE
6196-41030-0052 I HAVE ON MY OWN PART MADE IT MY CARE AND STUDY
6196-41030-0053 SHOULD NOT ONLY BE TRUE
6196-41030-0054 PREOCCUPIED AND OBSTRUCTED IN A MANNER NOT HARSH OR UNPLEASANT IT IS BUT REASONABLE HOWEVER ESPECIALLY IN SO GREAT A RESTORATION
6196-41030-0055 OF LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE THAT I SHOULD CLAIM OF MEN ONE FAVOUR IN RETURN WHICH IS THIS IF ANY ONE WOULD FORM AN OPINION OR JUDGMENT EITHER OUT OF HIS OWN OBSERVATION
6196-41030-0056 OR OUT OF THE CROWD OF AUTHORITIES OR OUT OF THE FORMS OF DEMONSTRATION WHICH HAVE NOW ACQUIRED A SANCTION LIKE THAT OF JUDICIAL LAWS CONCERNING THESE SPECULATIONS OF MINE
6196-41030-0057 LET HIM NOT HOPE THAT HE CAN DO IT IN PASSAGE OR BY THE BY BUT LET HIM EXAMINE THE THING THOROUGHLY
6196-41030-0058 OF THE WAY WHICH I DESCRIBE AND LAY OUT LET HIM FAMILIARISE HIS THOUGHTS WITH THAT SUBTLETY OF NATURE TO WHICH EXPERIENCE BEARS WITNESS LET HIM CORRECT BY SEASONABLE PATIENCE AND DUE DELAY
6196-41030-0059 THE DEPRAVED AND DEEP ROOTED HABITS OF HIS MIND
