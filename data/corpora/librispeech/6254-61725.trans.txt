6254-61725-0000 ONCE OUTSIDE THE MAJOR TOOK NO FURTHER PART IN THE AFFAIR AS THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE POST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF PLACE FOR HIM TO HAVE GIVEN ENCOURAGEMENT TO A FIGHT EVEN BY HIS INTERFERING TO SEE THAT IT SHOULD BE A FAIR ONE
6254-61725-0001 THIS HOWEVER WAS ATTENDED TO BY THE YOUNGER OFFICERS WHO AT ONCE SET ABOUT ARRANGING THE CONDITIONS OF THE DUEL THERE WAS NOT MUCH TIME CONSUMED THE TERMS HAD BEEN EXPRESSED ALREADY
6254-61725-0002 AND IT ONLY REMAINED TO APPOINT SOME ONE OF THE PARTY TO SUPERINTEND THE RINGING OF THE BELL WHICH WAS TO BE THE SIGNAL FOR THE COMBAT TO COMMENCE THIS WAS AN EASY MATTER
6254-61725-0003 SINCE IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE WHO MIGHT BE ENTRUSTED WITH THE DUTY A CHILD MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED THE SUMMONS FOR THE TERRIBLE CONFLICT THAT WAS TO FOLLOW A STRANGER CHANCING AT THAT MOMENT TO RIDE INTO THE RUDE SQUARE OF WHICH THE HOTEL ROUGH AND READY
6254-61725-0004 FORMED NEARLY A SIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORELY PUZZLED TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS COMING TO PASS THE NIGHT WAS RATHER DARK THOUGH THERE WAS STILL LIGHT ENOUGH TO MAKE KNOWN THE PRESENCE OF A CONGLOMERATION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6254-61725-0005 ASSEMBLED IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE HOTEL MOST WERE IN MILITARY GARB SINCE IN ADDITION TO THE OFFICERS WHO HAD LATELY FIGURED INSIDE THE SALOON OTHERS ALONG WITH SUCH SOLDIERS AS WERE PERMITTED TO PASS THE SENTRIES
6254-61725-0006 HAD HASTENED DOWN FROM THE FORT ON RECEIVING INTELLIGENCE THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS GOING ON WITHIN THE SQUARE WOMEN TOO BUT SCANTILY ROBED
6254-61725-0007 SOLDIERS WIVES WASHERWOMEN AND SENORITAS OF MORE QUESTIONABLE CALLING HAD FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE STREET AND WERE ENDEAVOURING TO EXTRACT FROM THOSE WHO HAD FORESTALLED THEM AN EXPLANATION OF THE FRACAS
6254-61725-0008 THE CONVERSATION WAS CARRIED ON IN LOW TONES IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE COMMANDANT OF THE POST WAS PRESENT AS WELL AS OTHERS IN AUTHORITY AND THIS CHECKED ANY PROPENSITY THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOR NOISY DEMONSTRATION
6254-61725-0009 THE CROWD THUS PROMISCUOUSLY COLLECTED WAS NOT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH THE HOTEL BUT STANDING WELL OUT IN THE OPEN GROUND ABOUT A DOZEN YARDS FROM THE BUILDING TOWARDS IT HOWEVER THE EYES OF ALL WERE DIRECTED
6254-61725-0010 WITH THAT STEADY STARE WHICH TELLS OF THE ATTENTION BEING FIXED ON SOME ENGROSSING SPECTACLE THEY WERE WATCHING THE MOVEMENTS OF TWO MEN WHOSE POSITIONS WERE APART ONE AT EACH END OF THE HEAVY BLOCKHOUSE
6254-61725-0011 KNOWN TO BE THE BAR ROOM OF THE HOTEL AND WHERE AS ALREADY STATED THERE WAS A DOOR THOUGH SEPARATED BY THE INTERPOSITION OF TWO THICK LOG WALLS AND MUTUALLY INVISIBLE
6254-61725-0012 THESE MEN WERE MANOEUVRING AS IF ACTUATED BY A COMMON IMPULSE THEY STOOD CONTIGUOUS TO THE ENTRANCE DOORS AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE BAR ROOM THROUGH BOTH OF WHICH GLARED THE LIGHT OF THE CAMPHINE LAMPS
6254-61725-0013 FALLING IN BROAD DIVERGENT BANDS UPON THE ROUGH GRAVEL OUTSIDE NEITHER WAS IN FRONT OF THE CONTIGUOUS ENTRANCE BUT A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE JUST CLEAR OF THE LIGHT NEITHER WAS IN AN UPRIGHT ATTITUDE BUT CROUCHING
6254-61725-0014 NOT AS IF FROM FEAR BUT LIKE A RUNNER ABOUT TO MAKE A START AND STRAINING UPON THE SPRING BOTH WERE LOOKING INWARDS INTO THE SALOON WHERE NO SOUND COULD BE HEARD SAVE THE TICKING OF A CLOCK
6254-61725-0015 THEIR ATTITUDES TOLD OF THEIR READINESS TO ENTER IT AND THAT THEY WERE ONLY RESTRAINED BY WAITING FOR SOME PRECONCERTED SIGNAL THAT THEIR PURPOSE WAS A SERIOUS ONE COULD BE DEDUCED FROM SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES
6254-61725-0016 BOTH WERE IN THEIR SHIRT SLEEVES HATLESS AND STRIPPED OF EVERY RAG THAT MIGHT FORM AN IMPEDIMENT TO ACTION WHILE ON THEIR FACES WAS THE STAMP OF STERN DETERMINATION
6254-61725-0017 BUT THERE WAS NO FINE REFLECTION NEEDED TO DISCOVER THEIR DESIGN THE STRANGER CHANCING TO COME INTO THE SQUARE COULD HAVE SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT IT WAS DEADLY THE PISTOLS IN THEIR HANDS
6254-61725-0018 COCKED AND TIGHTLY CLUTCHED THE NERVOUS ENERGY OF THEIR ATTITUDES THE SILENCE OF THE CROWD OF SPECTATORS AND THE CONCENTRATED INTEREST WITH WHICH THE TWO MEN WERE REGARDED PROCLAIMED MORE EMPHATICALLY THAN WORDS
6254-61725-0019 THAT THERE WAS DANGER IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN SHORT THAT THEY WERE ENGAGED IN SOME SORT OF A STRIFE WITH DEATH FOR ITS PROBABLE CONSUMMATION SO IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT WHEN THE CRISIS HAD COME
6254-61725-0020 THE DUELLISTS STOOD EACH WITH EYE INTENT UPON THE DOOR BY WHICH HE WAS TO MAKE ENTRANCE PERHAPS INTO ETERNITY THEY ONLY WAITED FOR A SIGNAL TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD
6254-61725-0021 AND ENGAGE IN A COMBAT THAT MUST TERMINATE THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OR THE OTHER PERHAPS BOTH WERE THEY LISTENING FOR THAT FATAL FORMULARY ONE TWO FIRE
6254-61725-0022 NO ANOTHER SIGNAL HAD BEEN AGREED UPON AND IT WAS GIVEN A STENTORIAN VOICE WAS HEARD CALLING OUT THE SIMPLE MONOSYLLABLE
6254-61725-0023 THREE OR FOUR DARK FIGURES COULD BE SEEN STANDING BY THE SHORN TRUNK ON WHICH SWUNG THE TAVERN BELL THE COMMAND INSTANTLY SET THEM IN MOTION AND ALONG WITH THE OSCILLATION OF THEIR ARMS DIMLY SEEN THROUGH THE DARKNESS
6254-61725-0024 COULD BE HEARD THE SONOROUS TONES OF A BELL THAT BELL WHOSE SOUNDS HAD BEEN HITHERTO HEARD ONLY AS SYMBOLS OF JOY CALLING MEN TOGETHER TO PARTAKE OF THAT WHICH PERPETUATES LIFE WAS NOW LISTENED TO AS A SUMMONS OF DEATH
6254-61725-0025 THE RINGING IN WAS OF SHORT DURATION THE BELL HAD MADE LESS THAN A SCORE OF VIBRATIONS WHEN THE MEN ENGAGED AT THE ROPE SAW THAT THEIR SERVICES WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DUELLISTS
6254-61725-0026 WHO HAD RUSHED INSIDE THE SALOON THE QUICK SHARP CRACKING OF PISTOLS THE SHIVERING OF BROKEN GLASS ADMONISHED THE RINGERS THAT THEIRS WAS BUT A SUPERFLUOUS NOISE AND DROPPING THE ROPE THEY STOOD LIKE THE REST OF THE CROWD
6254-61725-0027 LISTENING TO THE CONFLICT INSIDE NO EYES SAVE THOSE OF THE COMBATANTS THEMSELVES WERE WITNESSES TO THAT STRANGE DUEL AT THE FIRST DONG OF THE BELL BOTH COMBATANTS HAD RE ENTERED THE ROOM
6254-61725-0028 NEITHER MADE AN ATTEMPT TO SKULK OUTSIDE
6254-61725-0029 A HUNDRED EYES WERE UPON THEM AND THE SPECTATORS UNDERSTOOD THE CONDITIONS OF THE DUEL THAT NEITHER WAS TO FIRE BEFORE CROSSING THE THRESHOLD ONCE INSIDE THE CONFLICT COMMENCED THE FIRST SHOTS FILLING THE ROOM WITH SMOKE
6254-61725-0030 BOTH KEPT THEIR FEET THOUGH BOTH WERE WOUNDED THEIR BLOOD SPURTING OUT OVER THE SANDED FLOOR THE SECOND SHOTS WERE ALSO FIRED SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT AT RANDOM THE SMOKE HINDERING THE AIM
6254-61725-0031 THEN CAME A SINGLE SHOT QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER AND SUCCEEDED BY AN INTERVAL OF QUIET PREVIOUS TO THIS THE COMBATANTS HAD BEEN HEARD RUSHING ABOUT THROUGH THE ROOM THIS NOISE WAS NO LONGER BEING MADE INSTEAD
6254-61725-0032 THERE WAS PROFOUND SILENCE HAD THEY KILLED ONE ANOTHER WERE BOTH DEAD NO ONCE MORE THE DOUBLE DETONATION ANNOUNCED THAT BOTH STILL LIVED THE SUSPENSION HAD BEEN CAUSED
6254-61725-0033 AS THEY STOOD PEERING THROUGH THE SMOKE IN THE ENDEAVOUR TO DISTINGUISH ONE ANOTHER NEITHER SPOKE OR STIRRED IN FEAR OF BETRAYING HIS POSITION AGAIN THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TRANQUILLITY SIMILAR TO THE FORMER BUT MORE PROLONGED
6254-61725-0034 IT ENDED BY ANOTHER EXCHANGE OF SHOTS ALMOST INSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY THE FALLING OF TWO HEAVY BODIES UPON THE FLOOR THERE WAS THE SOUND OF SPRAWLING THE OVERTURNING OF CHAIRS THEN A SINGLE SHOT THE ELEVENTH
6254-61725-0035 AND THIS WAS THE LAST THAT WAS FIRED THE SPECTATORS OUTSIDE SAW ONLY A CLOUD OF SULPHUROUS SMOKE OOZING OUT OF BOTH DOORS AND DIMMING THE LIGHT OF THE CAMPHINE LAMPS
6254-61725-0036 THIS WITH AN OCCASIONAL FLASH OF BRIGHTER EFFULGENCE CLOSE FOLLOWED BY A CRACK WAS ALL THAT OCCURRED TO GIVE SATISFACTION TO THE EYE
6254-61725-0037 THAT WAS GRATIFIED BY A GREATER VARIETY THERE WERE HEARD SHOTS AFTER THE BELL HAD BECOME SILENT OTHER SOUNDS THE SHARP SHIVERING OF BROKEN GLASS THE DULLER CRASH OF FALLING FURNITURE RUDELY OVERTURNED IN EARNEST STRUGGLE
6254-61725-0038 THE TRAMPLING OF FEET UPON THE BOARDED FLOOR AT INTERVALS THE CLEAR RINGING CRACK OF THE REVOLVERS BUT NEITHER OF THE VOICES OF THE MEN WHOSE INSENSATE PASSIONS WERE THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS COMMOTION
6254-61725-0039 THE CROWD IN THE STREET HEARD THE CONFUSED NOISES AND NOTED THE INTERVALS OF SILENCE WITHOUT BEING EXACTLY ABLE TO INTERPRET THEM THE REPORTS OF THE PISTOLS WERE ALL THEY HAD TO PROCLAIM THE PROGRESS OF THE DUEL
6254-61725-0040 ELEVEN HAD BEEN COUNTED AND IN BREATHLESS SILENCE THEY WERE LISTENING FOR THE TWELFTH INSTEAD OF A PISTOL REPORT THEIR EARS WERE GRATIFIED BY THE SOUND OF A VOICE RECOGNISED AS THAT OF THE MUSTANGER
6254-61725-0041 MY PISTOL IS AT YOUR HEAD I HAVE ONE SHOT LEFT AN APOLOGY OR YOU DIE BY THIS THE CROWD HAD BECOME CONVINCED THAT THE FIGHT WAS APPROACHING ITS TERMINATION
6254-61725-0042 SOME OF THE MORE FEARLESS LOOKING IN BEHELD A STRANGE SCENE THEY SAW TWO MEN LYING PROSTRATE ON THE PLANK FLOOR BOTH WITH BLOODSTAINED HABILIMENTS BOTH EVIDENTLY DISABLED
6254-61725-0043 WHERE THEY HAD CRAWLED CLOSER TO GET A LAST SHOT AT EACH OTHER ONE OF THEM IN SCARLET SCARF AND SLASHED VELVET TROUSERS SLIGHTLY SURMOUNTING THE OTHER AND HOLDING A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD
6254-61725-0044 SUCH WAS THE TABLEAU THAT PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE SPECTATORS AS THE SULPHUROUS SMOKE DRIFTED OUT BY THE CURRENT BETWEEN THE TWO DOORS GAVE THEM A CHANCE OF DISTINGUISHING OBJECTS WITHIN THE SALOON
6254-61725-0045 AT THE SAME INSTANT WAS HEARD A DIFFERENT VOICE FROM THE ONE WHICH HAD ALREADY SPOKEN IT WAS CALHOUN'S NO LONGER IN ROISTERING BRAVADO
6254-61725-0046 ALMOST A WHISPER ENOUGH DAMN IT DROP YOUR SHOOTING IRON
