3641-134615-0001 I DONT DISPUTE THE NECESSITY BUT I DONT THINK THE SOME ONE SHOULD BE ME SAID JANETTA I WOULDNT MIND WRITING A LETTER OF ANGRY RECRIMINATION OR HEARTLESS SATIRE TO SOME SUITABLE RECIPIENT IN FACT I SHOULD RATHER ENJOY IT
3641-134615-0002 BUT IVE COME TO THE END OF MY CAPACITY FOR EXPRESSING SERVILE AMIABILITY ELEVEN LETTERS TO DAY AND NINE YESTERDAY ALL COUCHED IN THE SAME STRAIN OF ECSTATIC THANKFULNESS REALLY YOU CANT EXPECT ME TO SIT DOWN TO ANOTHER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS WRITING ONESELF OUT
3641-134615-0003 IVE WRITTEN NEARLY AS MANY SAID EGBERT AND IVE HAD MY USUAL BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE TO GET THROUGH TOO BESIDES I DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT THE FROPLINSONS SENT US A WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR CALENDAR SAID JANETTA
3641-134615-0004 WITH A QUOTATION OF ONE OF HIS GREAT THOUGHTS FOR EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR IMPOSSIBLE SAID EGBERT HE DIDNT HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUGHTS IN THE WHOLE OF HIS LIFE OR IF HE DID HE KEPT THEM TO HIMSELF HE WAS A MAN OF ACTION NOT OF INTROSPECTION
3641-134615-0005 WELL IT WAS WILLIAM WORDSWORTH THEN SAID JANETTA I KNOW WILLIAM CAME INTO IT SOMEWHERE THAT SOUNDS MORE PROBABLE SAID EGBERT WELL LETS COLLABORATE ON THIS LETTER OF THANKS AND GET IT DONE
3641-134615-0006 IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO THINK OF US
3641-134615-0007 ITS WHAT I ALWAYS DO SAY AND WHAT EVERY ONE SAYS TO ME PROTESTED EGBERT WE SENT THEM SOMETHING ON THE TWENTY SECOND SAID JANETTA SO THEY SIMPLY HAD TO THINK OF US THERE WAS NO GETTING AWAY FROM IT
3641-134615-0008 BRIDGE MARKERS SAID JANETTA IN A CARDBOARD CASE WITH SOME INANITY ABOUT DIGGING FOR FORTUNE WITH A ROYAL SPADE EMBLAZONED ON THE COVER THE MOMENT I SAW IT IN THE SHOP I SAID TO MYSELF FROPLINSONS AND TO THE ATTENDANT HOW MUCH
3641-134615-0009 WHEN HE SAID NINEPENCE I GAVE HIM THEIR ADDRESS JABBED OUR CARD IN PAID TENPENCE OR ELEVENPENCE TO COVER THE POSTAGE AND THANKED HEAVEN WITH LESS SINCERITY AND INFINITELY MORE TROUBLE THEY EVENTUALLY THANKED ME THE FROPLINSONS DONT PLAY BRIDGE SAID EGBERT
3641-134615-0010 ONE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO NOTICE SOCIAL DEFORMITIES OF THAT SORT SAID JANETTA IT WOULDNT BE POLITE BESIDES
3641-134615-0011 WHAT TROUBLE DID THEY TAKE TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE READ WORDSWORTH WITH GLADNESS FOR ALL THEY KNEW OR CARED WE MIGHT BE FRANTICALLY EMBEDDED IN THE BELIEF THAT ALL POETRY BEGINS AND ENDS WITH JOHN MASEFIELD AND IT MIGHT INFURIATE OR DEPRESS US TO HAVE A DAILY SAMPLE OF WORDSWORTHIAN PRODUCTS FLUNG AT US
3641-134615-0012 WELL LETS GET ON WITH THE LETTER OF THANKS SAID EGBERT PROCEED SAID JANETTA HOW CLEVER OF YOU TO GUESS THAT WORDSWORTH IS OUR FAVOURITE POET DICTATED EGBERT AGAIN JANETTA LAID DOWN HER PEN DO YOU REALISE WHAT THAT MEANS SHE ASKED
3641-134615-0013 A WORDSWORTH BOOKLET NEXT CHRISTMAS AND ANOTHER CALENDAR THE CHRISTMAS AFTER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OF HAVING TO WRITE SUITABLE LETTERS OF THANKFULNESS NO THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO DROP ALL FURTHER ALLUSION TO THE CALENDAR AND SWITCH OFF ON TO SOME OTHER TOPIC BUT WHAT OTHER TOPIC
3641-134615-0014 OH SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NEW YEAR HONOURS LIST A FRIEND OF OURS MADE SUCH A CLEVER REMARK WHEN HE READ IT THEN YOU CAN STICK IN ANY REMARK THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEAD IT NEEDNT BE CLEVER THE FROPLINSONS WONT KNOW WHETHER IT IS OR ISNT
3641-134615-0015 AND ANYHOW YOU CANT SUDDENLY DISMISS THE SUBJECT OF THE CALENDAR SURELY THERE MUST BE SOME INTELLIGENT REMARK THAT CAN BE MADE ABOUT IT WELL WE CANT THINK OF ONE SAID JANETTA WEARILY THE FACT IS WEVE BOTH WRITTEN OURSELVES OUT
3641-134615-0016 HEAVENS IVE JUST REMEMBERED MISSUS STEPHEN LUDBERRY I HAVENT THANKED HER FOR WHAT SHE SENT WHAT DID SHE SEND I FORGET I THINK IT WAS A CALENDAR THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE
3641-134615-0017 THE FORLORN SILENCE OF THOSE WHO ARE BEREFT OF HOPE AND HAVE ALMOST CEASED TO CARE PRESENTLY EGBERT STARTED FROM HIS SEAT WITH AN AIR OF RESOLUTION THE LIGHT OF BATTLE WAS IN HIS EYES LET ME COME TO THE WRITING TABLE HE EXCLAIMED GLADLY SAID JANETTA
3641-134615-0018 ARE YOU GOING TO WRITE TO MISSUS LUDBERRY OR THE FROPLINSONS TO NEITHER SAID EGBERT DRAWING A STACK OF NOTEPAPER TOWARDS HIM IM GOING TO WRITE TO THE EDITOR OF EVERY ENLIGHTENED AND INFLUENTIAL NEWSPAPER IN THE KINGDOM IM GOING TO SUGGEST THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SORT OF
3641-134615-0019 EPISTOLARY TRUCE OF GOD DURING THE FESTIVITIES OF CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR FROM THE TWENTY FOURTH OF DECEMBER TO THE THIRD OR FOURTH OF JANUARY IT SHALL BE CONSIDERED AN OFFENCE AGAINST GOOD SENSE AND GOOD FEELING TO WRITE OR EXPECT ANY LETTER
3641-134615-0020 OR COMMUNICATION THAT DOES NOT DEAL WITH THE NECESSARY EVENTS OF THE MOMENT ANSWERS TO INVITATIONS ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT TRAINS RENEWAL OF CLUB SUBSCRIPTIONS AND OF COURSE ALL THE ORDINARY EVERYDAY AFFAIRS OF BUSINESS SICKNESS
3641-134615-0021 ENGAGING NEW COOKS AND SO FORTH THESE WILL BE DEALT WITH IN THE USUAL MANNER AS SOMETHING INEVITABLE A LEGITIMATE PART OF OUR DAILY LIFE BUT ALL THE DEVASTATING ACCRETIONS OF CORRESPONDENCE INCIDENT TO THE FESTIVE SEASON
3641-134615-0022 THESE SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY TO GIVE THE SEASON A CHANCE OF BEING REALLY FESTIVE A TIME OF UNTROUBLED UNPUNCTUATED PEACE AND GOOD WILL BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PRESENTS RECEIVED OBJECTED JANETTA OTHERWISE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER KNOW WHETHER THEY HAD ARRIVED SAFELY
3641-134615-0023 OF COURSE I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID EGBERT EVERY PRESENT THAT WAS SENT OFF WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A TICKET BEARING THE DATE OF DISPATCH AND THE SIGNATURE OF THE SENDER
3641-134615-0024 AND SOME CONVENTIONAL HIEROGLYPHIC TO SHOW THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE A CHRISTMAS OR NEW YEAR GIFT THERE WOULD BE A COUNTERFOIL WITH SPACE FOR THE RECIPIENTS NAME AND THE DATE OF ARRIVAL AND ALL YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO WOULD BE TO SIGN AND DATE THE COUNTERFOIL ADD A CONVENTIONAL HIEROGLYPHIC
3641-134615-0025 SOUNDS DELIGHTFULLY SIMPLE SAID JANETTA WISTFULLY BUT PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER IT TOO CUT AND DRIED TOO PERFUNCTORY IT IS NOT A BIT MORE PERFUNCTORY THAN THE PRESENT SYSTEM SAID EGBERT
3641-134615-0026 I HAVE ONLY THE SAME CONVENTIONAL LANGUAGE OF GRATITUDE AT MY DISPOSAL WITH WHICH TO THANK DEAR OLD COLONEL CHUTTLE FOR HIS PERFECTLY DELICIOUS STILTON WHICH WE SHALL DEVOUR TO THE LAST MORSEL AND THE FROPLINSONS FOR THEIR CALENDAR WHICH WE SHALL NEVER LOOK AT
3641-134615-0027 COLONEL CHUTTLE KNOWS THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE STILTON WITHOUT HAVING TO BE TOLD SO AND THE FROPLINSONS KNOW THAT WE ARE BORED WITH THEIR CALENDAR WHATEVER WE MAY SAY TO THE CONTRARY JUST AS WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE BORED WITH THE BRIDGE MARKERS IN SPITE OF THEIR WRITTEN ASSURANCE THAT THEY THANKED US FOR OUR CHARMING LITTLE GIFT
3641-134615-0028 WHAT IS MORE THE COLONEL KNOWS THAT EVEN IF WE HAD TAKEN A SUDDEN AVERSION TO STILTON OR BEEN FORBIDDEN IT BY THE DOCTOR WE SHOULD STILL HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER OF HEARTY THANKS AROUND IT SO YOU SEE THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT
3641-134615-0029 IS JUST AS PERFUNCTORY AND CONVENTIONAL AS THE COUNTERFOIL BUSINESS WOULD BE ONLY TEN TIMES MORE TIRESOME AND BRAIN RACKING YOUR PLAN WOULD CERTAINLY BRING THE IDEAL OF A HAPPY CHRISTMAS A STEP NEARER REALISATION SAID JANETTA
3641-134615-0030 THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS OF COURSE SAID EGBERT PEOPLE WHO REALLY TRY TO INFUSE A BREATH OF REALITY INTO THEIR LETTERS OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AUNT SUSAN FOR INSTANCE WHO WRITES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE HAM
3641-134615-0031 NOT SUCH A GOOD FLAVOUR AS THE ONE YOU SENT LAST YEAR WHICH ITSELF WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE HAMS ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE IT WOULD BE A PITY TO BE DEPRIVED OF HER CHRISTMAS COMMENTS BUT THAT LOSS WOULD BE SWALLOWED UP IN THE GENERAL GAIN MEANWHILE SAID JANETTA
