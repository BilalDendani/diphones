6610-34596-0012 UNBELIEF IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER IMPERFECT MAY BE THE DIFFERENT SKETCHES OF RELIGION ESSAYED BY MAN EVEN WHEN HIS BELIEF IS SHAPELESS EVEN WHEN THE OUTLINE OF THE DOGMA IS NOT IN HARMONY
6610-34596-0013 IN THAT FATAL SECOND HE FEELS WEIGHING ON HIM A DIFFUSED RESPONSIBILITY THAT WHICH HAS BEEN COMPLICATES THAT WHICH IS TO BE THE PAST RETURNS AND ENTERS INTO THE FUTURE
6610-34596-0014 WHAT IS KNOWN BECOMES AS MUCH AN ABYSS AS THE UNKNOWN AND THE TWO CHASMS THE ONE WHICH IS FULL BY HIS FAULTS THE OTHER OF HIS ANTICIPATIONS MINGLE THEIR REVERBERATIONS
6610-34596-0015 IT IS THIS CONFUSION OF THE TWO GULFS WHICH TERRIFIES THE DYING MAN THEY HAD SPENT THEIR LAST GRAIN OF HOPE ON THE DIRECTION OF LIFE HENCE THEY TURNED IN THE OTHER THEIR ONLY REMAINING CHANCE WAS IN ITS DARK SHADOW
6610-34596-0016 THEY UNDERSTOOD IT IT CAME ON THEM AS A LUGUBRIOUS FLASH FOLLOWED BY THE RELAPSE OF HORROR THAT WHICH IS INTELLIGIBLE TO THE DYING MAN IS AS WHAT IS PERCEIVED IN THE LIGHTNING EVERYTHING THEN NOTHING YOU SEE

6610-34596-0018 THE DOCTOR ANSWERED THE QUESTION IS HOW TO PASS OVER THE UNKNOWN PRECIPICE AND REACH THE OTHER BANK OF LIFE WHICH IS BEYOND THE TOMB BEING THE ONE WHO KNOWS THE MOST MY DANGER IS GREATER THAN YOURS
6610-34596-0019 HE ADDED KNOWLEDGE IS A WEIGHT ADDED TO CONSCIENCE HE CONTINUED
6610-34596-0020 GOOD SAID THE DOCTOR THE LOW HOOD OF THE COMPANION ON WHICH HE LEANT HIS ELBOWS MADE A SORT OF TABLE THE DOCTOR TOOK FROM HIS POCKET HIS INKHORN AND PEN AND HIS POCKET BOOK OUT OF WHICH HE DREW A PARCHMENT
6610-34596-0021 HAD EXTINGUISHED THE TORCHES ONE AFTER ANOTHER THERE WAS BUT ONE LEFT
6610-34596-0022 AND HOLDING IT IN HIS HAND CAME AND STOOD BY THE DOCTOR'S SIDE THE DOCTOR REPLACED HIS POCKET BOOK IN HIS POCKET PUT DOWN THE PEN AND INKHORN ON THE HOOD OF THE COMPANION UNFOLDED THE PARCHMENT AND SAID LISTEN
6610-34596-0023 THEN IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA ON THE FAILING BRIDGE A SORT OF SHUDDERING FLOORING OF THE TOMB THE DOCTOR BEGAN A SOLEMN READING TO WHICH ALL THE SHADOWS SEEMED TO LISTEN THE DOOMED MEN BOWED THEIR HEADS AROUND HIM
6610-34596-0024 THE FLAMING OF THE TORCH INTENSIFIED THEIR PALLOR WHAT THE DOCTOR READ WAS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH NOW AND THEN WHEN ONE OF THOSE WOEBEGONE LOOKS SEEMED TO ASK AN EXPLANATION THE DOCTOR WOULD STOP TO REPEAT
6610-34596-0025 WHETHER IN FRENCH OR SPANISH BASQUE OR ITALIAN THE PASSAGE HE HAD JUST READ STIFLED SOBS AND HOLLOW BEATINGS OF THE BREAST WERE HEARD
6610-34596-0026 THE READING OVER THE DOCTOR PLACED THE PARCHMENT FLAT ON THE COMPANION SEIZED HIS PEN AND ON A CLEAR MARGIN WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY LEFT AT THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HE HAD WRITTEN HE SIGNED HIMSELF GERNARDUS GEESTEMUNDE DOCTOR
6610-34596-0027 WHO NOT KNOWING HOW TO WRITE MADE A CROSS THE DOCTOR BY THE SIDE OF THIS CROSS WROTE BARBARA FERMOY OF TYRRIF ISLAND IN THE HEBRIDES
6610-34596-0028 THE CHIEF SIGNED GAIZDORRA CAPTAL THE GENOESE SIGNED HIMSELF UNDER THE CHIEF'S NAME
6610-34596-0029 UNDER THESE SIGNATURES THE DOCTOR ADDED A NOTE OF THE CREW OF THREE MEN THE SKIPPER HAVING BEEN WASHED OVERBOARD BY A SEA BUT TWO REMAIN AND THEY HAVE SIGNED THE TWO SAILORS AFFIXED THEIR NAMES UNDERNEATH THE NOTE
6610-34596-0030 THE NORTHERN BASQUE SIGNED HIMSELF GALDEAZUN THE SOUTHERN BASQUE SIGNED AVE MARIA ROBBER THEN THE DOCTOR SAID CAPGAROUPE HERE
6610-34596-0031 CAPGAROUPE DRANK OFF THE LAST MOUTHFUL OF BRANDY AND HANDED THE FLASK TO THE DOCTOR THE WATER WAS RISING IN THE HOLD THE WRECK WAS SINKING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE SEA
6610-34596-0032 THE SLOPING EDGES OF THE SHIP WERE COVERED BY A THIN GNAWING WAVE WHICH WAS RISING ALL WERE CROWDED ON THE CENTRE OF THE DECK THE DOCTOR DRIED THE INK ON THE SIGNATURES BY THE HEAT OF THE TORCH
6610-34596-0033 GALDEAZUN WENT FORWARD
6610-34596-0034 IT IS DONE SAID THE DOCTOR AND FROM OUT ALL THEIR MOUTHS VAGUELY STAMMERED IN EVERY LANGUAGE CAME THE DISMAL UTTERANCES OF THE CATACOMBS
6610-34596-0035 ARO RAI AMEN IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SOMBRE VOICES OF BABEL WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE SHADOWS AS HEAVEN UTTERED ITS AWFUL REFUSAL TO HEAR THEM THE DOCTOR TURNED AWAY FROM HIS COMPANIONS IN CRIME AND DISTRESS
6610-34596-0036 THE WRECK WAS SINKING BEHIND THE DOCTOR ALL THE OTHERS WERE IN A DREAM PRAYER MASTERED THEM BY MAIN FORCE THEY DID NOT BOW THEY WERE BENT THERE WAS SOMETHING INVOLUNTARY IN THEIR CONDITION
6610-34596-0037 THEY WAVERED AS A SAIL FLAPS WHEN THE BREEZE FAILS AND THE HAGGARD GROUP TOOK BY DEGREES WITH CLASPING OF HANDS AND PROSTRATION OF FOREHEADS ATTITUDES VARIOUS YET OF HUMILIATION
6610-34596-0038 THE DEEP RESERVE OF NATURE WHICH ENVELOPED HIM PREOCCUPIED WITHOUT DISCONCERTING HIM HE WAS NOT ONE TO BE TAKEN UNAWARES OVER HIM WAS THE CALM OF A SILENT HORROR ON HIS COUNTENANCE THE MAJESTY OF GOD'S WILL COMPREHENDED
6610-34596-0039 THIS OLD AND THOUGHTFUL OUTLAW UNCONSCIOUSLY ASSUMED THE AIR OF A PONTIFF HE SAID ATTEND TO ME HE CONTEMPLATED FOR A MOMENT THE WASTE OF WATER AND ADDED NOW WE ARE GOING TO DIE THEN HE TOOK THE TORCH FROM THE HANDS OF AVE MARIA
6610-34596-0040 THEN THE DOCTOR CAST THE TORCH INTO THE SEA THE TORCH WAS EXTINGUISHED ALL LIGHT DISAPPEARED NOTHING LEFT BUT THE HUGE UNFATHOMABLE SHADOW IT WAS LIKE THE FILLING UP OF THE GRAVE IN THE DARKNESS THE DOCTOR WAS HEARD SAYING
6610-34596-0041 LET US PRAY ALL KNELT DOWN IT WAS NO LONGER ON THE SNOW BUT IN THE WATER THAT THEY KNELT THEY HAD BUT A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOCTOR ALONE REMAINED STANDING
6610-34596-0042 THE FLAKES OF SNOW FALLING ON HIM HAD SPRINKLED HIM WITH WHITE TEARS AND MADE HIM VISIBLE ON THE BACKGROUND OF DARKNESS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SPEAKING STATUE OF THE SHADOW THE DOCTOR MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS AND RAISED HIS VOICE
6610-34596-0043 WHILE BENEATH HIS FEET HE FELT THAT ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE OSCILLATION WHICH PREFACES THE MOMENT IN WHICH A WRECK IS ABOUT TO FOUNDER HE SAID
6610-34596-0044 THE IRISHWOMAN REPEATED IN GAELIC UNDERSTOOD BY THE BASQUE WOMAN
6610-34596-0045 SANCTIFICETUR NOMEN TUUM
6610-34596-0046 SICUT IN COELO SICUT IN TERRA SAID THE DOCTOR NO VOICE ANSWERED HIM HE LOOKED DOWN ALL THEIR HEADS WERE UNDER WATER THEY HAD LET THEMSELVES BE DROWNED ON THEIR KNEES
6610-34596-0047 AND RAISED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD THE WRECK WAS GOING DOWN AS HE SANK THE DOCTOR MURMURED THE REST OF THE PRAYER FOR AN INSTANT HIS SHOULDERS WERE ABOVE WATER THEN HIS HEAD THEN NOTHING REMAINED BUT HIS ARM HOLDING UP THE FLASK
6610-34596-0048 AS IF HE WERE SHOWING IT TO THE INFINITE HIS ARM DISAPPEARED THERE WAS NO GREATER FOLD ON THE DEEP SEA THAN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON A TUN OF OIL THE SNOW CONTINUED FALLING ONE THING FLOATED
