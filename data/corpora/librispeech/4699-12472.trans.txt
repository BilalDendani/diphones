4699-12472-0000 AND RUMORS ABOUT THEM RAN ABROAD THIS MADE THE INHABITANTS OF THOSE COUNTRIES TO BE IN NO SMALL FEAR ACCORDINGLY THEY SENT AMBASSADORS TO ONE ANOTHER AND EXHORTED ONE ANOTHER TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND TO ENDEAVOR TO DESTROY THESE MEN
4699-12472-0001 THOSE THAT INDUCED THE REST TO DO SO WERE SUCH AS INHABITED GOBOLITIS AND PETRA THEY WERE CALLED AMALEKITES AND WERE THE MOST WARLIKE OF THE NATIONS THAT LIVED THEREABOUT AND WHOSE KINGS EXHORTED ONE ANOTHER
4699-12472-0002 AND SUCH A ONE AS HAD RUN AWAY FROM SLAVERY UNDER THE EGYPTIANS LAY IN WAIT TO RUIN THEM WHICH ARMY THEY WERE NOT IN COMMON PRUDENCE AND REGARD TO THEIR OWN SAFETY TO OVERLOOK
4699-12472-0003 BUT TO CRUSH THEM BEFORE THEY GATHER STRENGTH AND COME TO BE IN PROSPERITY AND PERHAPS ATTACK THEM FIRST IN A HOSTILE MANNER AS PRESUMING UPON OUR INDOLENCE IN NOT ATTACKING THEM BEFORE AND THAT WE OUGHT TO AVENGE OURSELVES OF THEM FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE WILDERNESS
4699-12472-0004 FOR THESE LAST SEEM TO BE ANGRY ONLY AT THE FLOURISHING OF OTHERS BUT THE FORMER DO NOT LEAVE ANY ROOM FOR THEIR ENEMIES TO BECOME TROUBLESOME TO THEM
4699-12472-0005 WHO EXPECTED NO SUCH WARLIKE PREPARATIONS AND WHEN THESE NATIONS WERE READY TO FIGHT AND THE MULTITUDE OF THE HEBREWS WERE OBLIGED TO TRY THE FORTUNE OF WAR THEY WERE IN A MIGHTY DISORDER AND IN WANT OF ALL NECESSARIES
4699-12472-0006 THEN THEREFORE IT WAS THAT MOSES BEGAN TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND TO EXHORT THEM TO HAVE A GOOD HEART AND RELY ON GOD'S ASSISTANCE BY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN STATE OF FREEDOM AND TO HOPE FOR VICTORY OVER THOSE WHO WERE READY TO FIGHT WITH THEM IN ORDER TO DEPRIVE THEM OF THAT BLESSING
4699-12472-0007 THAT THEY WERE TO SUPPOSE THEIR OWN ARMY TO BE NUMEROUS WANTING NOTHING NEITHER WEAPONS NOR MONEY NOR PROVISIONS NOR SUCH OTHER CONVENIENCES AS WHEN MEN ARE IN POSSESSION OF THEY FIGHT UNDAUNTEDLY
4699-12472-0008 AND THAT THEY ARE TO JUDGE THEMSELVES TO HAVE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES IN THE DIVINE ASSISTANCE THEY ARE ALSO TO SUPPOSE THE ENEMY'S ARMY TO BE SMALL UNARMED WEAK AND SUCH AS WANT THOSE CONVENIENCES WHICH THEY KNOW MUST BE WANTED WHEN IT IS GOD'S WILL
4699-12472-0009 THAT THEY SHALL BE BEATEN AND HOW VALUABLE GOD'S ASSISTANCE IS THEY HAD EXPERIENCED IN ABUNDANCE OF TRIALS AND THOSE SUCH AS WERE MORE TERRIBLE THAN WAR FOR THAT IS ONLY AGAINST MEN
4699-12472-0010 BUT THESE WERE AGAINST FAMINE AND THIRST THINGS INDEED THAT ARE IN THEIR OWN NATURE INSUPERABLE AS ALSO AGAINST MOUNTAINS AND THAT SEA WHICH AFFORDED THEM NO WAY FOR ESCAPING
4699-12472-0011 YET HAD ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES BEEN CONQUERED BY GOD'S GRACIOUS KINDNESS TO THEM SO HE EXHORTED THEM TO BE COURAGEOUS AT THIS TIME AND TO LOOK UPON THEIR ENTIRE PROSPERITY
4699-12472-0012 WHO THEN CALLED TOGETHER THE PRINCES OF THEIR TRIBES AND THEIR CHIEF MEN
4699-12472-0013 SO THE PEOPLE WERE ELEVATED IN THEIR MINDS AND READY TO TRY THEIR FORTUNE IN BATTLE
4699-12472-0014 NAY THEY DESIRED THAT MOSES WOULD IMMEDIATELY LEAD THEM AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES WITHOUT THE LEAST DELAY THAT NO BACKWARDNESS MIGHT BE A HINDRANCE TO THEIR PRESENT RESOLUTION SO MOSES SORTED ALL THAT WERE FIT FOR WAR INTO DIFFERENT TROOPS AND SET JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN
4699-12472-0015 OF THE TRIBE OF EPHRAIM OVER THEM
4699-12472-0016 AND PATIENT TO UNDERGO LABORS OF GREAT ABILITIES TO UNDERSTAND AND TO SPEAK WHAT WAS PROPER AND VERY SERIOUS IN THE WORSHIP OF GOD
4699-12472-0017 HE ALSO APPOINTED A SMALL PARTY OF THE ARMED MEN TO BE NEAR THE WATER AND TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN AND OF THE ENTIRE CAMP
4699-12472-0018 THEY TOOK THEIR WEAPONS IF ANY OF THEM HAD SUCH AS WERE WELL MADE AND ATTENDED TO THEIR COMMANDERS AS READY TO RUSH FORTH TO THE BATTLE AS SOON AS MOSES SHOULD GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND MOSES ALSO KEPT AWAKE TEACHING JOSHUA
4699-12472-0019 AFTER WHAT MANNER HE SHOULD ORDER HIS CAMP BUT WHEN THE DAY BEGAN MOSES CALLED FOR JOSHUA AGAIN
4699-12472-0020 HE ALSO GAVE A PARTICULAR EXHORTATION TO THE PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE HEBREWS AND ENCOURAGED THE WHOLE ARMY AS IT STOOD ARMED BEFORE HIM
4699-12472-0021 AND WHEN HE HAD THUS ANIMATED THE ARMY BOTH BY HIS WORDS AND WORKS AND PREPARED EVERY THING HE RETIRED TO A MOUNTAIN AND COMMITTED THE ARMY TO GOD
4699-12472-0022 AND IT CAME TO A CLOSE FIGHT HAND TO HAND BOTH SIDES SHOWING GREAT ALACRITY AND ENCOURAGING ONE ANOTHER
4699-12472-0023 HE BADE HIS BROTHER AARON AND HUR THEIR SISTER MIRIAM'S HUSBAND TO STAND ON EACH SIDE OF HIM AND TAKE HOLD OF HIS HANDS AND NOT PERMIT HIS WEARINESS TO PREVENT IT BUT TO ASSIST HIM IN THE EXTENSION OF HIS HANDS
4699-12472-0024 WHEN THIS WAS DONE THE HEBREWS CONQUERED THE AMALEKITES BY MAIN FORCE AND INDEED THEY HAD ALL PERISHED UNLESS THE APPROACH OF THE NIGHT HAD OBLIGED THE HEBREWS TO DESIST FROM KILLING ANY MORE SO OUR FOREFATHERS OBTAINED A MOST SIGNAL AND MOST SEASONABLE VICTORY
4699-12472-0025 FOR THEY NOT ONLY OVERCAME THOSE THAT FOUGHT AGAINST THEM BUT TERRIFIED ALSO THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS AND GOT GREAT AND SPLENDID ADVANTAGES WHICH THEY OBTAINED OF THEIR ENEMIES BY THEIR HARD PAINS IN THIS BATTLE FOR WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THE ENEMY'S CAMP
4699-12472-0026 THEY GOT READY BOOTY FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR THEIR OWN PRIVATE FAMILIES WHEREAS TILL THEN THEY HAD NOT ANY SORT OF PLENTY OF EVEN NECESSARY FOOD THE FOREMENTIONED BATTLE WHEN THEY HAD ONCE GOT IT WAS ALSO THE OCCASION OF THEIR PROSPERITY
4699-12472-0027 NOT ONLY FOR THE PRESENT BUT FOR THE FUTURE AGES ALSO FOR THEY NOT ONLY MADE SLAVES OF THE BODIES OF THEIR ENEMIES BUT SUBDUED THEIR MINDS ALSO
4699-12472-0028 MOREOVER THEY ACQUIRED A VAST QUANTITY OF RICHES FOR A GREAT DEAL OF SILVER AND GOLD WAS LEFT IN THE ENEMY'S CAMP AS ALSO BRAZEN VESSELS
4699-12472-0029 WHICH THEY MADE COMMON USE OF IN THEIR FAMILIES MANY UTENSILS ALSO THAT WERE EMBROIDERED THERE WERE OF BOTH SORTS THAT IS OF WHAT WERE WEAVED AND WHAT WERE THE ORNAMENTS OF THEIR ARMOR AND OTHER THINGS THAT SERVED FOR USE IN THE FAMILY AND FOR THE FURNITURE OF THEIR ROOMS
4699-12472-0030 THEY GOT ALSO THE PREY OF THEIR CATTLE AND OF WHATSOEVER USES TO FOLLOW CAMPS WHEN THEY REMOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER SO THE HEBREWS NOW VALUED THEMSELVES UPON THEIR COURAGE AND CLAIMED GREAT MERIT FOR THEIR VALOR
4699-12472-0031 AND THEY PERPETUALLY INURED THEMSELVES TO TAKE PAINS BY WHICH THEY DEEMED EVERY DIFFICULTY MIGHT BE SURMOUNTED
4699-12472-0032 AND GAVE REWARDS TO SUCH AS HAD SIGNALIZED THEMSELVES IN THE ACTION AND HIGHLY COMMENDED JOSHUA THEIR GENERAL WHO WAS ATTESTED TO BY ALL THE ARMY ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT ACTIONS HE HAD DONE
4699-12472-0033 NOR WAS ANY ONE OF THE HEBREWS SLAIN BUT THE SLAIN OF THE ENEMY'S ARMY WERE TOO MANY TO BE ENUMERATED SO MOSES OFFERED SACRIFICES OF THANKSGIVING TO GOD AND BUILT AN ALTAR WHICH HE NAMED
4699-12472-0034 THE LORD THE CONQUEROR HE ALSO FORETOLD THAT THE AMALEKITES SHOULD UTTERLY BE DESTROYED AND THAT HEREAFTER NONE OF THEM SHOULD REMAIN BECAUSE THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THE HEBREWS AND THIS WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WILDERNESS AND IN THEIR DISTRESS ALSO
4699-12472-0035 MOREOVER HE REFRESHED THE ARMY WITH FEASTING AND THUS DID THEY FIGHT THIS FIRST BATTLE WITH THOSE THAT VENTURED TO OPPOSE THEM AFTER THEY WERE GONE OUT OF EGYPT BUT WHEN MOSES HAD CELEBRATED THIS FESTIVAL FOR THE VICTORY
4699-12472-0036 HE PERMITTED THE HEBREWS TO REST FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN HE BROUGHT THEM OUT AFTER THE FIGHT IN ORDER OF BATTLE
4699-12472-0037 AND GOING GRADUALLY ON HE CAME TO MOUNT SINAI IN THREE MONTHS TIME AFTER THEY WERE REMOVED OUT OF EGYPT AT WHICH MOUNTAIN AS WE HAVE BEFORE RELATED THE VISION OF THE BUSH AND THE OTHER WONDERFUL APPEARANCES HAD HAPPENED CHAPTER THREE
4699-12472-0038 THAT MOSES KINDLY RECEIVED HIS FATHER IN LAW JETHRO WHEN HE CAME TO HIM TO MOUNT SINAI
4699-12472-0039 HE WILLINGLY CAME TO MEET HIM AND MOSES AND HIS CHILDREN AND PLEASED HIMSELF WITH HIS COMING AND WHEN HE HAD OFFERED SACRIFICE HE MADE A FEAST FOR THE MULTITUDE NEAR THE BUSH HE HAD FORMERLY SEEN WHICH MULTITUDE
4699-12472-0040 EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO THEIR FAMILIES PARTOOK OF THE FEAST BUT
4699-12472-0041 AND SUNG HYMNS TO GOD AS TO HIM WHO HAD BEEN THE AUTHOR PROCURER OF THEIR DELIVERANCE AND THEIR FREEDOM THEY ALSO PRAISED THEIR CONDUCTOR AS HIM BY WHOSE VIRTUE IT WAS THAT ALL THINGS HAD SUCCEEDED WITH THEM
4699-12472-0042 MADE GREAT ENCOMIUMS UPON THE WHOLE MULTITUDE AND HE COULD NOT BUT ADMIRE MOSES FOR HIS FORTITUDE AND THAT HUMANITY HE HAD SHEWN IN THE DELIVERY OF HIS FRIENDS CHAPTER FOUR
4699-12472-0043 UNDER THEIR RULERS OF THOUSANDS AND RULERS OF HUNDREDS WHO LIVED WITHOUT ORDER BEFORE
4699-12472-0044 EVERY ONE STILL GOING TO HIM AND SUPPOSING THAT THEY SHOULD THEN ONLY OBTAIN JUSTICE IF HE WERE THE ARBITRATOR AND THOSE THAT LOST THEIR CAUSES THOUGHT IT NO HARM WHILE THEY THOUGHT THEY LOST THEM JUSTLY AND NOT BY PARTIALITY
4699-12472-0045 BUT AFTERWARD HE TOOK HIM TO HIMSELF
4699-12472-0046 AND ADVISED HIM TO LEAVE THE TROUBLE OF LESSER CAUSES TO OTHERS
4699-12472-0047 FOR THAT CERTAIN OTHERS OF THE HEBREWS MIGHT BE FOUND THAT WERE FIT TO DETERMINE CAUSES BUT THAT NOBODY BUT A MOSES COULD TAKE OF THE SAFETY OF SO MANY TEN THOUSANDS BE THEREFORE SAYS HE INSENSIBLE OF THINE OWN VIRTUE
4699-12472-0048 AND WHAT THOU HAST DONE BY MINISTERING UNDER GOD TO THE PEOPLE'S PRESERVATION PERMIT THEREFORE THE DETERMINATION OF COMMON CAUSES TO BE DONE BY OTHERS BUT DO THOU RESERVE THYSELF TO THE ATTENDANCE ON GOD ONLY
4699-12472-0049 AND LOOK OUT FOR METHODS OF PRESERVING THE MULTITUDE FROM THEIR PRESENT DISTRESS MAKE USE OF THE METHOD I SUGGEST TO YOU AS TO HUMAN AFFAIRS AND TAKE A REVIEW OF THE ARMY AND APPOINT CHOSEN RULERS OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS AND THEN OVER THOUSANDS
4699-12472-0050 THEN DIVIDE THEM INTO FIVE HUNDREDS AND AGAIN INTO HUNDREDS AND INTO FIFTIES AND SET RULERS OVER EACH OF THEM WHO MAY DISTINGUISH THEM INTO THIRTIES AND KEEP THEM IN ORDER AND AT LAST NUMBER THEM BY TWENTIES AND BY TENS
4699-12472-0051 AND LET THERE BE ONE COMMANDER OVER EACH NUMBER TO BE DENOMINATED FROM THE NUMBER OF THOSE OVER WHOM THEY ARE RULERS BUT SUCH AS THE WHOLE MULTITUDE HAVE TRIED AND DO APPROVE OF
4699-12472-0052 ONE WITH ANOTHER BUT IF ANY GREAT CAUSE ARISE LET THEM BRING THE COGNIZANCE OF IT BEFORE THE RULERS OF A HIGHER DIGNITY BUT IF ANY GREAT DIFFICULTY ARISE THAT IS TOO HARD FOR EVEN THEIR DETERMINATION LET THEM SEND IT TO THEE
4699-12472-0053 BY THESE MEANS TWO ADVANTAGES WILL BE GAINED THE HEBREWS WILL HAVE JUSTICE DONE THEM AND THOU WILT BE ABLE TO ATTEND CONSTANTLY ON GOD
4699-12472-0054 AND MOSES RECEIVED HIS ADVICE VERY KINDLY AND ACTED ACCORDING TO HIS SUGGESTION NOR DID HE CONCEAL THE INVENTION OF THIS METHOD NOR PRETEND TO IT HIMSELF BUT INFORMED THE MULTITUDE WHO IT WAS THAT INVENTED IT
4699-12472-0055 AS THINKING IT RIGHT TO GIVE A TRUE TESTIMONY TO WORTHY PERSONS ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN REPUTATION BY ASCRIBING TO HIMSELF THE INVENTIONS OF OTHER MEN WHENCE WE MAY LEARN THE VIRTUOUS DISPOSITION OF MOSES BUT OF SUCH HIS DISPOSITION
