3698-29401-0000 THE RIVER INTRODUCES US I STOOD ALONE ON THE BANK OF THE UGLIEST STREAM IN ENGLAND THE MOONLIGHT POURING ITS UNCLOUDED RADIANCE OVER OPEN SPACE
3698-29401-0001 ON THOSE SLUGGISH WATERS BROAD AND MUDDY THEIR STEALTHY CURRENT FLOWED ONWARD TO THE SEA WITHOUT A ROCK TO DIVERSIFY WITHOUT A BUBBLE TO BREAK THE SULLEN SURFACE ON THE SIDE FROM WHICH I WAS LOOKING AT THE RIVER
3698-29401-0002 THE NEGLECTED TREES GREW SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THEY WERE UNDERMINING THEIR OWN LIVES AND POISONING EACH OTHER ON THE OPPOSITE BANK A RANK GROWTH OF GIGANTIC BULRUSHES HID THE GROUND BEYOND EXCEPT WHERE IT ROSE IN HILLOCKS
3698-29401-0003 A REPELLENT RIVER IN ITSELF A REPELLENT RIVER IN ITS SURROUNDINGS A REPELLENT RIVER EVEN IN ITS NAME IT WAS CALLED THE LOKE NEITHER POPULAR TRADITION NOR ANTIQUARIAN RESEARCH COULD EXPLAIN WHAT THE NAME MEANT
3698-29401-0004 OR COULD TELL WHEN THE NAME HAD BEEN GIVEN WE CALL IT THE LOKE THEY DO SAY NO FISH CAN LIVE IN IT AND IT DIRTIES THE CLEAN SALT WATER WHEN IT RUNS INTO THE SEA SUCH WAS THE CHARACTER OF THE RIVER IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW IT BEST
3698-29401-0005 BUT I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THE LOKE AGAIN THE UGLY RIVER LIKE THE WOODLAND GLADE LOOKED AT ME WITH THE FACE OF AN OLD FRIEND ON MY RIGHT HAND SIDE ROSE THE VENERABLE TIMBERS OF THE WATER MILL THE WHEEL WAS MOTIONLESS AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT
3698-29401-0006 AND THE WHOLE STRUCTURE LOOKED AS REMEMBERED OBJECTS WILL LOOK WHEN WE SEE THEM AGAIN AFTER A LONG INTERVAL SMALLER THAN I HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE OTHERWISE I COULD DISCOVER NO CHANGE IN THE MILL BUT THE WOODEN COTTAGE ATTACHED TO IT
3698-29401-0007 HAD FELT THE DEVASTATING MARCH OF TIME A PORTION OF THE DECREPIT BUILDING STILL STOOD REVEALED IN ITS WRETCHED OLD AGE PROPPED PARTLY BY BEAMS WHICH REACHED FROM THE THATCHED ROOF TO THE GROUND AND PARTLY BY THE WALL OF A NEW COTTAGE ATTACHED
3698-29401-0008 PRESENTING IN YELLOW BRICK WORK A HIDEOUS MODERN CONTRAST TO ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF ITS ANCIENT NEIGHBOR HAD THE MILLER WHOM I REMEMBERED DIED AND WERE THESE CHANGES THE WORK OF HIS SUCCESSOR I THOUGHT OF ASKING THE QUESTION AND TRIED THE DOOR
3698-29401-0009 IT WAS FASTENED THE WINDOWS WERE ALL DARK EXCEPTING ONE WHICH I DISCOVERED IN THE UPPER STOREY AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE NEW BUILDING HERE THERE WAS A DIM LIGHT BURNING IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTURB A PERSON WHO FOR ALL I KNEW TO THE CONTRARY
3698-29401-0010 MIGHT BE GOING TO BED I TURNED BACK TO THE LOKE PROPOSING TO EXTEND MY WALK BY A MILE OR A LITTLE MORE TO A VILLAGE THAT I REMEMBERED ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER
3698-29401-0011 PAUSING TO LISTEN I HEARD NEXT THE WORKING OF OARS IN THEIR ROWLOCKS AFTER ANOTHER INTERVAL A BOAT APPEARED TURNING A PROJECTION IN THE BANK AND ROWED BY A WOMAN PULLING STEADILY AGAINST THE STREAM AS THE BOAT APPROACHED ME IN THE MOONLIGHT
3698-29401-0012 THIS PERSON CORRECTED MY FIRST IMPRESSION AND REVEALED HERSELF AS A YOUNG GIRL SO FAR AS I COULD PERCEIVE SHE WAS A STRANGER TO ME WHO COULD THE GIRL BE ALONE ON THE RIVER AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT IDLY CURIOUS I FOLLOWED THE BOAT
3698-29401-0013 INSTEAD OF PURSUING MY WAY TO THE VILLAGE TO SEE WHETHER SHE WOULD STOP AT THE MILL OR PASS IT SHE STOPPED AT THE MILL SECURED THE BOAT AND STEPPED ON SHORE TAKING A KEY FROM HER POCKET SHE WAS ABOUT TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE COTTAGE
3698-29401-0014 WHEN I ADVANCED AND SPOKE TO HER AS FAR FROM RECOGNIZING HER AS EVER I FOUND MYSELF NEVERTHELESS THINKING OF AN ODD OUTSPOKEN CHILD LIVING AT THE MILL IN PAST YEARS WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF MY POOR MOTHER'S FAVORITES AT OUR VILLAGE SCHOOL
3698-29401-0015 I RAN THE RISK OF OFFENDING HER BY BLUNTLY EXPRESSING THE THOUGHT WHICH WAS THEN IN MY MIND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU ARE CRISTEL TOLLER I SAID THE QUESTION SEEMED TO AMUSE HER WHY SHOULDN'T I BE CRISTEL TOLLER SHE ASKED
3698-29401-0016 YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL I EXPLAINED WHEN I SAW YOU LAST YOU ARE SO ALTERED NOW AND SO IMPROVED THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED YOU MIGHT BE THE DAUGHTER OF GILES TOLLER OF THE MILL IF I HAD NOT SEEN YOU OPENING THE COTTAGE DOOR SHE ACKNOWLEDGED MY COMPLIMENT BY A CURTSEY
3698-29401-0017 WHICH REMINDED ME AGAIN OF THE VILLAGE SCHOOL THANK YOU YOUNG MAN SHE SAID SMARTLY I WONDER WHO YOU ARE TRY IF YOU CAN RECOLLECT ME I SUGGESTED MAY I TAKE A LONG LOOK AT YOU AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
3698-29401-0018 SHE STUDIED MY FACE WITH A MENTAL EFFORT TO REMEMBER ME WHICH GATHERED HER PRETTY EYEBROWS TOGETHER QUAINTLY IN A FROWN THERE'S SOMETHING IN HIS EYES SHE REMARKED NOT SPEAKING TO ME BUT TO HERSELF WHICH DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE STRANGE
3698-29401-0019 MY DEAR I AM ONLY TRYING IF YOU CAN REMEMBER GERARD ROYLAKE WHILE IN CHARGE OF THE BOAT THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER HAD BEEN ROWING WITH BARED ARMS BEAUTIFUL DUSKY ARMS AT ONCE DELICATE AND STRONG THUS FAR SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO COVER THEM UP
3698-29401-0020 HER VERBAL APOLOGIES FOLLOWED YOU USED TO BE SUCH A SWEET SPOKEN PRETTY LITTLE BOY SHE SAID HOW SHOULD I KNOW YOU AGAIN WITH A BIG VOICE AND ALL THAT HAIR ON YOUR FACE
3698-29401-0021 HALF THE COUNTY BELONGS TO HIM SHE TRIED ANOTHER APOLOGY AND HIT THIS TIME ON THE CONVENTIONAL FORM I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR
3698-29401-0022 I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SIR SHE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE INTO THE COTTAGE I FOLLOWED HER TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR SURELY IT'S NOT TIME TO GO TO BED YET I VENTURED TO SAY SHE WAS STILL ON HER GOOD BEHAVIOR TO HER LANDLORD NOT IF YOU OBJECT TO IT SIR
3698-29401-0023 SHE ANSWERED THIS RECOGNITION OF MY AUTHORITY WAS IRRESISTIBLE CRISTEL HAD LAID ME UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO HER GOOD INFLUENCE FOR WHICH I FELT SINCERELY GRATEFUL SHE HAD MADE ME LAUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MY RETURN TO ENGLAND
3698-29401-0024 WE NEEDN'T SAY GOOD NIGHT JUST YET I SUGGESTED I WANT TO HEAR A LITTLE MORE ABOUT YOU SHALL I COME IN SHE STEPPED OUT OF THE DOORWAY EVEN MORE RAPIDLY THAN SHE HAD STEPPED INTO IT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
3698-29401-0025 BUT I THOUGHT CRISTEL SEEMED TO BE ACTUALLY ALARMED BY MY PROPOSAL WE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE RIVER BANK ON EVERY OCCASION WHEN WE APPROACHED THE COTTAGE I DETECTED HER IN STEALING A LOOK AT THE UGLY MODERN PART OF IT THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE THIS TIME
3698-29401-0026 I SAW DOUBT I SAW ANXIETY IN HER FACE WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE MILL I MADE SOME DOMESTIC INQUIRIES BEGINNING WITH HER FATHER WAS THE MILLER ALIVE AND WELL OH YES SIR FATHER GETS THINNER AS HE GETS OLDER THAT'S ALL
3698-29401-0027 DID HE SEND YOU OUT BY YOURSELF AT THIS LATE HOUR IN THE BOAT
3698-29401-0028 POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RIVER SIDE VILLAGE FATHER ISN'T AS QUICK AS HE USED TO BE HE'S OFTEN LATE OVER HIS WORK NOW WAS THERE NO ONE TO GIVE GILES TOLLER THE HELP THAT HE MUST NEED AT HIS AGE
3698-29401-0029 I SAID A CHANGE OF EXPRESSION APPEARED IN HER BRIGHT BROWN EYES WHICH ROUSED MY CURIOSITY I ALSO OBSERVED THAT SHE EVADED A DIRECT REPLY WHAT MAKES YOU DOUBT SIR IF FATHER AND I LIVE ALONE SHE ASKED I POINTED TO THE NEW COTTAGE
3698-29401-0030 THAT UGLY BUILDING I ANSWERED SEEMS TO GIVE YOU MORE ROOM THAN YOU WANT UNLESS THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE LIVING AT THE MILL I HAD NO INTENTION OF TRYING TO FORCE THE REPLY FROM HER WHICH SHE HAD HITHERTO WITHHELD BUT SHE APPEARED TO PUT THAT INTERPRETATION ON WHAT I HAD SAID
3698-29401-0031 IF YOU WILL HAVE IT SHE BURST OUT THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE LIVING WITH US A MAN WHO HELPS YOUR FATHER NO A MAN WHO PAYS MY FATHER'S RENT I WAS QUITE UNPREPARED FOR SUCH A REPLY AS THIS CRISTEL HAD SURPRISED ME
3698-29401-0032 TO BEGIN WITH HER FATHER WAS WELL CONNECTED AS WE SAY IN ENGLAND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER HAD MADE A FORTUNE IN COMMERCE AND HAD VAINLY OFFERED HIM THE MEANS OF RETIRING FROM THE MILL WITH A SUFFICIENT INCOME THEN AGAIN GILES TOLLER WAS KNOWN TO HAVE SAVED MONEY
3698-29401-0033 HIS DOMESTIC EXPENSES MADE NO HEAVY DEMAND ON HIS PURSE HIS GERMAN WIFE WHOSE CHRISTIAN NAME WAS NOW BORNE BY HIS DAUGHTER HAD DIED LONG SINCE HIS SONS WERE NO BURDEN ON HIM THEY HAD NEVER LIVED AT THE MILL IN MY REMEMBRANCE
3698-29401-0034 WITH ALL THESE REASONS AGAINST HIS TAKING A STRANGER INTO HIS HOUSE HE HAD NEVERTHELESS IF MY INTERPRETATION OF CRISTEL'S ANSWER WAS THE RIGHT ONE LET HIS SPARE ROOMS TO A LODGER
3698-29401-0035 I SAID THE MORE MONEY FATHER HAS THE MORE HE WANTS THAT'S THE REASON SHE ADDED BITTERLY WHY HE ASKED FOR PLENTY OF ROOM WHEN THE COTTAGE WAS BUILT AND WHY WE HAVE GOT A LODGER
3698-29401-0036 I DON'T KNOW IS A MAN A GENTLEMAN IF HE KEEPS A SERVANT OH DON'T TROUBLE TO THINK ABOUT IT SIR IT ISN'T WORTH THINKING ABOUT THIS WAS PLAIN SPEAKING AT LAST YOU DON'T SEEM TO LIKE THE LODGER I SAID I HATE HIM
3698-29401-0037 WHY SHE TURNED ON ME WITH A LOOK OF ANGRY AMAZEMENT NOT UNDESERVED I MUST OWN ON MY PART WHICH SHOWED HER DARK BEAUTY IN THE PERFECTION OF ITS LUSTER AND ITS POWER TO MY EYES SHE WAS AT THE MOMENT IRRESISTIBLY CHARMING
3698-29401-0038 I DARESAY I WAS BLIND TO THE DEFECTS IN HER FACE MY GOOD GERMAN TUTOR USED TO LAMENT THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF MY BOYHOOD STILL LEFT IN ME HONESTLY ADMIRING HER I LET MY FAVORABLE OPINION EXPRESS ITSELF A LITTLE TOO PLAINLY
3698-29401-0039 WHAT A SPLENDID CREATURE YOU ARE I BURST OUT CRISTEL DID HER DUTY TO HERSELF AND TO ME SHE PASSED OVER MY LITTLE EXPLOSION OF NONSENSE WITHOUT TAKING THE SMALLEST NOTICE OF IT MASTER GERARD SHE BEGAN AND CHECKED HERSELF
3698-29401-0040 PLEASE TO EXCUSE ME SIR YOU HAVE SET MY HEAD RUNNING ON OLD TIMES WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS
3698-29401-0041 AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT OUR LODGER I HATE HIM BECAUSE I HATE HIM THERE IGNORANT AS I WAS OF THE NATURES OF WOMEN I UNDERSTOOD HER AT LAST CRISTEL'S OPINION OF THE LODGER WAS EVIDENTLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE LODGER'S OPINION OF CRISTEL
3698-29401-0042 WHEN I ADD THAT THIS DISCOVERY DID DECIDEDLY OPERATE AS A RELIEF TO MY MIND THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED ON ME BY THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER IS STATED WITHOUT EXAGGERATION AND WITHOUT RESERVE GOOD NIGHT SHE REPEATED FOR THE LAST TIME
3698-29401-0043 I HELD OUT MY HAND IS IT QUITE RIGHT SIR SHE MODESTLY OBJECTED FOR SUCH AS ME TO SHAKE HANDS WITH SUCH AS YOU SHE DID IT NEVERTHELESS AND DROPPING MY HAND CAST A FAREWELL LOOK AT THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT OF HER INTEREST
3698-29401-0044 THE NEW COTTAGE HER VARIABLE HUMOR CHANGED ON THE INSTANT
