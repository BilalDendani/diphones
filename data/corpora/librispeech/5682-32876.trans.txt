5682-32876-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE VISITS HIS SISTER'S SICK BED I SUSPECT THERE ARE VERY FEW MERE HYPOCRITES ON EARTH OF COURSE I DO NOT RECKON THOSE
5682-32876-0001 WHO ARE UNDER COMPULSION TO AFFECT PURITY OF MANNERS AND A HOLY INTEGRITY OF HEART AND THERE ARE SUCH BUT THOSE WHO VOLUNTEER AN EXTRAORDINARY PROFESSION OF HOLINESS BEING ALL THE WHILE CONSCIOUS VILLAINS THE PHARISEES
5682-32876-0002 WORE A MASK I AM SURE HE OFTEN WORE IT WHEN HE WAS QUITE ALONE I DON'T KNOW INDEED THAT HE EVER TOOK IT OFF HE WAS PERHAPS CONTENT TO SEE IT EVEN WHEN HE LOOKED IN THE GLASS AND HAD NOT A VERY
5682-32876-0003 DISTINCT IDEA WHAT THE UNDERLYING FEATURES MIGHT BE IT ANSWERS WITH THE WORLD IT ALMOST ANSWERS WITH HIMSELF PITY IT WON'T DO EVERYWHERE WHEN MOSES WENT TO SPEAK WITH GOD SAYS THE ADMIRABLE HALL
5682-32876-0004 HE PULLED OFF HIS VEIL IT WAS GOOD REASON HE SHOULD PRESENT TO GOD THAT FACE WHICH HE HAD MADE THERE HAD BEEN MORE NEED OF HIS VEIL TO HIDE THE GLORIOUS FACE OF GOD FROM HIM THAN TO HIDE HIS FROM GOD
5682-32876-0005 HYPOCRITES ARE CONTRARY TO MOSES HE SHOWED HIS WORST TO MEN HIS BEST TO GOD THEY SHOW THEIR BEST TO MEN THEIR WORST TO GOD BUT GOD SEES BOTH THEIR VEIL AND THEIR FACE AND I KNOW NOT WHETHER HE MORE HATES THEIR VEIL
5682-32876-0006 HIS STRANGE EYES GLANCED NOW THIS WAY NOW THAT WITH A FIERCE RESTLESSNESS NOW TO THE WINDOW NOW TO THE DOOR AND YOU WOULD HAVE SAID HE WAS LISTENING INTENTLY TO SOME
5682-32876-0007 ONE AFTER THE OTHER TWO OR THREE LITTLE WAFERS OF A DARK HUE AND PLACED THEM SUCCESSIVELY ON HIS TONGUE AND SUFFERED THEM TO MELT AND SO SWALLOWED THEM
5682-32876-0008 A LITTLE IN OPIUM HE WAS NOT A GREAT ADEPT YET AT LEAST LIKE THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO CAN SWALLOW FIVE HUNDRED DROPS OF LAUDANUM AT A SITTING BUT HE KNEW THE VIRTUES OF THE DRUG AND CULTIVATED ITS ACQUAINTANCE
5682-32876-0009 AND WAS OFTENER UNDER ITS INFLUENCE THAN PERHAPS ANY MORTAL EXCEPT HIMSELF SUSPECTED
5682-32876-0010 THERE WAS A TWITTERING OF SMALL BIRDS AMONG THE BROWN LEAVES AND IVY AND A THOUSAND OTHER PLEASANT SOUNDS AND SIGHTS STIRRING IN THE SHARP SUNNY AIR THIS SORT OF INFLEXIBLE MERRY MAKING
5682-32876-0011 IN THE EYES OF ANXIOUS CAPTAIN LAKE FEAR HATH TORMENT AND FEAR IS THE WORST INGREDIENT IN MENTAL PAIN THIS IS THE REASON WHY SUSPENSE IS SO INTOLERABLE AND THE RETROSPECT EVEN OF THE WORST LESS TERRIBLE
5682-32876-0012 WHY DID TIME LIMP SO TEDIOUSLY AWAY WITH HIM PROLONGING HIS ANGUISH GRATUITOUSLY HE FELT TRUCULENTLY
5682-32876-0013 WITH A DREADFUL YEARNING HE HATED THE FRESH GLITTER OF THAT MORNING SCENE WHY SHOULD THE WORLD BE CHEERFUL IT WAS A REPAST SPREAD OF WHICH HE COULD NOT PARTAKE AND IT SPITED HIM
5682-32876-0014 WITH HIS WALKING CANE IF HE COULD AND DRAPED THE WORLD IN BLACK HE SAW FROM HIS WINDOW THE
5682-32876-0015 IN WHITE CHOKER AND SEEDY BLACK
5682-32876-0016 THEY WERE VERY BUSY TALKING LITTLE FAIRY USED TO WALK WHEN PAROCHIAL VISITS WERE NOT VERY DISTANT
5682-32876-0017 WITH HIS WAPSIE HOW THAT NAME CAME ABOUT NO ONE REMEMBERED BUT THE VICAR ANSWERED TO IT MORE CHEERILY THAN TO ANY OTHER THE LITTLE MAN WAS SOLITARY AND THESE RAMBLES WERE A DELIGHT A BEAUTIFUL SMILING LITTLE FELLOW VERY EXACTING
5682-32876-0018 THAT LED THE WISE MEN AND THE CELESTIAL SONG HEARD BY THE SHEPHERDS KEEPING THEIR FLOCKS BY NIGHT AND SNATCHES OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS AND SOMETIMES WHEN THEY MADE A FEAST AND EAT THEIR PENNYWORTH OF CHERRIES SITTING ON THE STYLE HE TREATED HIM
5682-32876-0019 I AM AFRAID TO THE PROFANE HISTORIES OF JACK THE GIANT KILLER AND THE YELLOW DWARF THE VICAR HAD THEORIES ABOUT IMAGINATION AND FANCIED IT WAS AN IMPORTANT FACULTY AND THAT THE CREATOR HAD NOT GIVEN CHILDREN THEIR
5682-32876-0020 UNEXTINGUISHABLE LOVE OF STORIES TO NO PURPOSE I DON'T ENVY THE MAN WHO IS SUPERIOR TO THE SOCIETY OF CHILDREN WHAT CAN HE GAIN FROM CHILDREN'S TALK IS IT WITTY OR WISE OR LEARNED BE FRANK IS IT NOT
5682-32876-0021 HONESTLY A MERE NOISE AND INTERRUPTION A MUSICAL CACKLING OF GEESE AND SILVERY BRAYING OF TINY ASSES WELL SAY I OUT OF MY LARGE ACQUAINTANCE THERE ARE NOT MANY MEN TO WHOM I WOULD GO FOR WISDOM
5682-32876-0022 LEARNING IS BETTER FOUND IN BOOKS AND AS FOR WIT IS IT ALWAYS PLEASANT THE MOST COMPANIONABLE MEN ARE NOT ALWAYS THE GREATEST INTELLECTS THEY LAUGH AND THOUGH THEY DON'T CONVERSE
5682-32876-0023 THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL IN WILL HONEYCOMB FOR INSTANCE BUT OUR DEAR MISTER SPECTATOR TELLS US SOMEWHERE THAT HE LAUGHED EASILY WHICH I THINK QUITE ACCOUNTS FOR HIS ACCEPTANCE WITH THE CLUB HE WAS KINDLY AND ENJOYING
5682-32876-0024 WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOUR DOG SO CHARMING A COMPANION IN YOUR WALKS SIMPLY THAT HE THOROUGHLY LIKES YOU AND ENJOYS HIMSELF HE APPEALS IMPERCEPTIBLY TO YOUR AFFECTIONS WHICH CANNOT BE STIRRED
5682-32876-0025 SUCH IS GOD'S WILL EVER SO LIGHTLY WITHOUT SOME LITTLE THRILLINGS OF HAPPINESS AND THROUGH THE SUBTLE ABSORBENTS OF YOUR SYMPATHY HE INFUSES INTO YOU SOMETHING OF HIS OWN HILARIOUS AND EXULTING SPIRIT WHEN STANLEY LAKE SAW THE VICAR
5682-32876-0026 THE LINES OF HIS PALE FACE CONTRACTED STRANGELY AND HIS WILD GAZE FOLLOWED HIM AND I DON'T THINK HE BREATHED ONCE UNTIL THE THIN SMILING MAN
5682-32876-0027 BRIGHT BOY HOLDING BY HIS HAND HAD PASSED BY
5682-32876-0028 THAT ON GREETING MISTER LARKIN IN THE PARLOUR HE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO MENTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN COLD IN THAT CONFOUNDED BILLIARD ROOM LAST NIGHT WHICH SPOILED HIS SLEEP AND MADE HIM AWFULLY SEEDY THAT MORNING OF COURSE HIS HOST WAS PROPERLY AFFLICTED AND SYMPATHETIC
5682-32876-0029 BY THE BYE I HAD A LETTER THIS MORNING FROM THAT PARTY OUR COMMON FRIEND MISTER W YOU KNOW SAID LARKIN GRACEFULLY WELL WHAT IS HE DOING AND WHEN DOES HE COME BACK YOU MEAN WYLDER OF COURSE

5682-32876-0040 A MOST RESPECTABLE PARTY A HIGH MAN AND OF COURSE THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY THERE WAS ONLY ONE LETTER THE ADDRESS WAS WRITTEN
5682-32876-0041 AND IN FACT LEFT AN ENDURING IMPRESSION UPON THAT IMPRESSIBLE NATURE TURNING UP THE DARK ROAD AT REDMAN'S DELL THE GALLANT CAPTAIN PASSED THE OLD MILL AND ALL BEING QUIET UP AND DOWN THE ROAD HE HALTED
5682-32876-0042 UNDER THE LORDLY SHADOW OF A CLUMP OF CHESTNUTS AND OPENED AND READ THE LETTER
5682-32876-0043 IT CONTAINED ONLY THESE WORDS WEDNESDAY ON FRIDAY NIGHT NEXT AT HALF PAST TWELVE THIS HE READ TWICE OR THRICE PAUSING BETWEEN WHILES THE ENVELOPE BORE THE LONDON POSTMARK

5682-32876-0045 STILL BLAZING AT THE ROOT OF THE OLD TREE HE STOOD BY AND SENT UP A LITTLE CURL OF BLUE SMOKE AN INCENSE TO THE DEMON OF THE WOOD AND TURNED IN A MINUTE MORE INTO A BLACK FILM OVERRUN BY A HUNDRED CREEPING SPARKLES
5682-32876-0046 AND HAVING COMPLETED HIS MYSTERIOUS INCREMATION HE WITH HIS YELLOW EYES MADE A STOLEN GLANCE AROUND AND LIGHTING HIS CIGAR GLIDED GRACEFULLY UP THE STEEP ROAD UNDER THE SOLEMN CANOPY OF OLD TIMBER TO THE SOUND OF THE MOANING STREAM BELOW
5682-32876-0047 HOW ARE ALL WHERE IS THAT GIRL MARGERY IN THE KITCHEN MASTER STANLEY SAID SHE COURTESYING AGAIN ARE YOU SURE SAID CAPTAIN LAKE PEEPING TOWARD THAT APARTMENT OVER THE OLD WOMAN'S SHOULDER CERTAIN SURE MASTER STANLEY

5682-32876-0050 THE WHITE CURTAINS AND WHITE COVERLET SO LIKE THE DARK CHAMBER OF WHITE DEATH HE HAD INTENDED SPEAKING TO TAMAR THERE BUT CHANGED HIS MIND OR RATHER COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND AND HE LOITERED SILENTLY AND STOOD WITH THE CURTAIN
5682-32876-0051 IN HIS GLOVED HAND LOOKING UPON THE COLD COVERLET AS IF RACHEL LAY DEAD THERE THAT WILL DO HE SAID AWAKING FROM HIS WANDERING THOUGHT WE'LL GO DOWN NOW TAMAR
