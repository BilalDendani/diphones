679-155529-0000 CARRYING THE BAG WITH ITS INDISPUTABLE PROOF OF SOME PERSON'S GUILT WE MADE OUR WAY THROUGH THE FAMILIAR CORRIDOR BY THE DRESSING ROOMS OUT UNDER THE ROOF OF THE SO CALLED LARGE STUDIO THERE
679-155529-0001 A SCENE OF GAYETY CONFRONTED US IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE GLOOMY ATMOSPHERE OF THE REST OF THE ESTABLISHMENT KAUF HOWEVER HAD THOROUGHLY DEMONSTRATED HIS GENIUS AS A DIRECTOR
679-155529-0002 TO COUNTERACT THE DEPRESSION CAUSED BY ALL THE RECENT MELODRAMATIC AND TRAGIC HAPPENINGS HE HAD BROUGHT IN AN EIGHT PIECE ORCHESTRA ESTABLISHING THE MEN IN THE SET ITSELF SO AS TO GET FULL PHOTOGRAPHIC VALUE FROM THEIR JAZZ ANTICS
679-155529-0003 WHERE WERNER AND MANTON HAD DISPENSED WITH MUSIC IN A DESPERATE EFFORT AT ECONOMY KAUF HAD REALIZED THAT MONEY SAVED IN THAT WAY WAS LOST THROUGH TIME WASTED WITH DISPIRITED PEOPLE
679-155529-0004 IT WAS A LESSON LEARNED LONG BEFORE BY OTHER COMPANIES IN OTHER STUDIOS I HAD SEEN MUSIC EMPLOYED IN THE MAKING OF SOBERLY DRAMATIC SCENES SOLELY AS AN AID TO THE ACTORS ENABLING THEM TO GET INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF THEIR WORK MORE QUICKLY
679-155529-0005 AND NATURALLY UNDER THE LIGHTS THE ENTIRE SET SPARKLED WITH A TAWDRY GARISHNESS APT TO FOOL THOSE UNINITIATED INTO THE SECRETS OF PHOTOGRAPHY ON THE SCREEN
679-155529-0006 WOULD TAKE ON A SOFT RICHNESS AND A DELICACY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH KAUF'S CHARACTERS WERE SUPPOSED TO MOVE OBVIOUSLY FRAGILE SCENERY
679-155529-0007 WOULD SEEM AS HEAVY AND SUBSTANTIAL AS THE WALLS AND BEAMS OF THE FINEST OLD MANSION EVEN THE INFERIOR MATERIALS IN THE GOWNS OF MOST OF THE GIRLS WOULD PHOTOGRAPH AS WELL AS THE MOST EXPENSIVE SILK IN FACT
679-155529-0008 BY LONG EXPERIENCE MANY OF THE EXTRA GIRLS HAD LEARNED TO COUNTERFEIT THE LATEST FASHIONS AT A COST RIDICULOUS BY COMPARISON KENNEDY APPROACHED KAUF THEN RETURNED TO US
679-155529-0009 HE ASKS US TO WAIT UNTIL HE GETS THIS ONE BIG SCENE IT'S THE CLIMAX OF THE PICTURE REALLY THE UNMASKING OF THE BLACK TERROR
679-155529-0010 HE MAY LOSE MORE THAN THAT MUTTERED MACKAY AND I WONDERED JUST WHOM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUSPECTED IS EVERYONE HERE I ASKED ALL SEVEN GORDON AND SHIRLEY OF THE MEN
679-155529-0011 AND MARILYN AND ENID OF COURSE WERE OUT ON THE FLOOR OF THE SUPPOSED BALLROOM GORDON I RECOGNIZED BECAUSE I REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS TO WEAR THE GARB OF A MONK MARILYN WAS EASILY PICKED OUT ALTHOUGH
679-155529-0012 THE VIVACITY SHE ASSUMED SEEMED UNNATURAL
679-155529-0013 OF A FAINT YELLOW WHICH WOULD PHOTOGRAPH DAZZLING WHITE REVEALING TRIM STOCKINGED ANKLES AND SLENDER BARE ARMS FRAMING FACE AND EYES DANCING WITH MERRIMENT AND MALICIOUSNESS
679-155529-0014 UNQUESTIONABLY SHE WAS THE PRETTIEST GIRL BENEATH THE ARCS NEVER TO BE SUSPECTED AS THE WOMAN WHO HAD BRAVED THE TERRORS OF A FILM FIRE TO RESCUE THE MAN SHE LOVED ENID WAS STATELY AND SERENE IN THE GOWN OF MARIE ANTOINETTE
679-155529-0015 IN THE BRIGHT GLARE HER FEATURES TOOK ON A ROUND INNOCENCE AND SHE WAS AS SUCCESSFUL IN PORTRAYING SWEETNESS AS MARILYN WAS IN THE SIMULATION OF THE MOCKING EVIL OF THE VAMPIRE
679-155529-0016 SHIRLEY INTERESTED ME THE MOST HOWEVER I WONDERED IF KENNEDY STILL ELIMINATED HIM IN GUESSING AT THE IDENTITY OF THE CRIMINAL I CALLED TO MIND THE HEAVY MAN'S PRESENCE IN THE BASEMENT AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION
679-155529-0017 AND MC GROARTY'S INFORMATION THAT HE HAD BEEN HANGING ABOUT THAT PART OF THE STUDIO FOR SOME TIME PREVIOUSLY SOME ONE HAD PLANTED A CIGARETTE CASE AND STUB TO IMPLICATE GORDON ACCORDING TO KENNEDY'S THEORY
679-155529-0018 AS WELL AS TO POINT SUSPICION TOWARD THE LEADING MAN IN THE MIDST OF MY REVERIE SHIRLEY APPROACHED AND PASSED US HE WAS IN THE GARB OF MEPHISTO LIKE THE OTHERS HE HAD NOT YET MASKED HIS FACE
679-155529-0019 A PECULIAR BRIGHTNESS IN HIS EYES STRUCK ME AND I NUDGED KENNEDY BELLADONNA KENNEDY EXPLAINED WHEN HE WAS BEYOND EARSHOT OH I REMEMBERED ENID TOLD HIM TO USE IT WHAT
679-155529-0020 I REPEATED THE CONVERSATION AS NEAR AS I COULD RECONSTRUCT IT
679-155529-0021 NO CURE AT ALL I WAS UNABLE TO GET ANY MORE OUT OF KENNEDY HOWEVER MANTON I DETECTED IN THE BACKGROUND WITH PHELPS THE TWO MEN WERE ARGUING AS ALWAYS AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BANKER WAS ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING
679-155529-0022 BY THIS CONSTANT HANGING ABOUT THE STUDIO WHERE PREVIOUSLY MY SYMPATHY HAD BEEN WITH PHELPS ENTIRELY NOW I REALIZED THAT THE PROMOTER HAD WON ME INDEED MANTON'S INTEREST IN ALL THE AFFAIRS OF PICTURE MAKING AT THIS PLANT
679-155529-0023 HAD BEEN FAR TOO SINCERE AND EARNEST TO PERMIT THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS SEEKING TO WRECK THE COMPANY OR TO DOUBLE CROSS HIS BACKER MILLARD ENTERED THE STUDIO AS I GLANCED ABOUT FOR HIM HE HANDED SOME SHEETS TO KAUF THEN TURNED TO LEAVE
679-155529-0024 I ATTRACTED KENNEDY'S ATTENTION YOU DON'T WANT MILLARD TO GET AWAY I WHISPERED KENNEDY SENT MACKAY TO STOP HIM THE AUTHOR ACCOMPANIED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILLINGLY YES MISTER KENNEDY
679-155529-0025 AS SOON AS THIS SCENE IS OVER WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE PROJECTION ROOM EVERYONE CONCERNED IN THE DEATH OF MISS LAMAR AND OF MISTER WERNER THE SCENARIO WRITER LOOKED UP QUICKLY DO YOU
679-155529-0026 HE ASKED SOBERLY NOT EXACTLY BUT I WILL IDENTIFY THE GUILTY PERSON
679-155529-0027 SHIRLEY HAD LEFT THE STUDIO FLOOR APPARENTLY TO GO TO HIS DRESSING ROOM NOW I NOTICED THAT HE RETURNED AND PASSED CLOSE JUST IN TIME TO HEAR MILLARD'S QUESTION AND KENNEDY'S ANSWER HIS EYES DILATED
679-155529-0028 HE WENT ON INTO THE SET BUT HIS LEGS SEEMED TO WABBLE BENEATH HIM I WAS SURE IT WAS MORE THAN THE WEAKNESS RESULTING FROM HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRE KAUF'S VOICE THROUGH THE MEGAPHONE ECHOED SUDDENLY FROM WALL TO WALL REVERBERATING BENEATH THE ROOF
679-155529-0029 ALL READY EVERYONE IN THE SET MASKS ON TAKE YOUR PLACES AT A SIGNAL THE ORCHESTRA STRUCK UP AND THE COUPLES STARTED TO DANCE IT WAS A WONDERFULLY COLORFUL SCENE AND I SAW THAT KAUF PROPOSED TO REHEARSE IT THOROUGHLY
679-155529-0030 DOING IT OVER AND OVER WITHOUT THE CAMERAS UNTIL EVERY DETAIL REACHED A PRACTICED PERFECTION IN THIS I WAS CERTAIN HE ACHIEVED RESULTS SUPERIOR TO WERNER'S SLAP DASH AND BANG THEN CAME THE CALL FOR ACTION
679-155529-0031 CAMERA KAUF BEGAN TO BOB UP AND DOWN INTO IT EVERYBODY FOR FASCINATION AND CHARM THIS FAR EXCEEDED THE BANQUET SCENE WHICH WE HAD WITNESSED IN THE TAKING PREVIOUSLY THE MUSIC WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD
679-155529-0032 SO THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PEOPLE NOT TO GET INTO THE SWING AND THE RESULT WAS A RIOTOUS SWIRLING OF GRACEFULLY DANCING PAIRS THE GIRLS SELECTED FOR THEIR BEAUTY FLASHING HALF REVEALED FACES TOWARD THE CAMERA
679-155529-0033 DISPLAYING EYES WHICH TWINKLED THROUGH THEIR MASKS IN MOCKERY AT A WHOLLY INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPT AT CONCEALMENT ENID MAINTAINED HER STATELY CARRIAGE BUT MADE FULL USE OF THE DAZZLING WHITENESS OF HER TEETH
679-155529-0034 WHOM SHE KNEW TO BE HER LOVER MARILYN WAS EVERYWHERE MAKING MISCHIEF THE BEST SHE COULD SHIRLEY STALKED ABOUT IN HIS SATANIC RED WHICH WOULD PHOTOGRAPH BLACK AND APPEAR EVEN MORE SOMBER ON THE SCREEN
679-155529-0035 OF COURSE THE WHOLE WAS NOT PHOTOGRAPHED IN A CONTINUOUS STRIP FROM ONE CAMERA POSITION I SAW THAT KAUF MADE SEVERAL LONG SHOTS TO CATCH THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE THEN HE MADE CLOSE UP SCENES OF ALL THE PRINCIPALS
679-155529-0036 AND OF SOME OF THE BEST APPEARING EXTRAS AT ONE TIME HE ORDERED A PANORAMA EFFECT IN WHICH THE CAMERAS PAMMED SWEPT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER GIVING A SUCCESSION OF FACES AT CLOSE RANGE FINALLY
679-155529-0037 EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR THE CLIMAX SHIRLEY HAD BEEN PLAYING A SORT OF JEKYLL AND HYDE ROLE IN WHICH HE WAS AT ONCE THE YOUNG LAWYER FRIEND OF ENID AND THE BLACK TERROR
679-155529-0038 UNMASKED AND CORNERED AT THIS FUNCTION OF A SOCIETY TERRIFIED BY THE DREAD UNKNOWN MENACE HE WAS TO MAKE THE TRANSFORMATION DIRECTLY BEFORE THE EYES OF EVERYONE USING THE MYTHICAL DRUG WHICH CHANGED HIM FROM A YOUNG MAN OF GOOD APPEARANCE AND FAMILY
679-155529-0039 TO THE BEING WHO WAS A VERY INCARNATION OF EVIL FOR ONCE KAUF DID NOT REHEARSE THE SCENE SHIRLEY WAS OBVIOUSLY WEAKENED FROM HIS EXPERIENCE AND THE DIRECTOR WISHED TO SPARE HIM
679-155529-0040 ALL THE DETAILS WERE SHOUTED OUT THROUGH THE MEGAPHONE HOWEVER AND I GRASPED THAT THE ACTION OF THIS PART OF THE DANCE WAS FAMILIAR TO EVERYONE IT WAS THE BIG SCENE OF THE STORY TOWARD WHICH ALL OTHER EVENTS HAD BUILT
679-155529-0041 AT THE START OF THIS EPISODE THE ORCHESTRA WAS PLAYING AND THE DANCERS WERE IN MOTION SUDDENLY GORDON AS THE HERO STRODE UP TO SHIRLEY AND UNMASKED HIM WITH A FEW BITTER WORDS WHICH LATER WOULD BE FLASHED UPON THE SCREEN IN A SPOKEN TITLE
679-155529-0042 INSTANTLY A CROWD GATHERED ABOUT BUT IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO OBSTRUCT THE CAMERA VIEW CORNERED SEEING THAT FLIGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
679-155529-0043 AND DRANK THE CONTENTS EVIDENTLY HE KNEW HIS MANSFIELD WELL SLOWLY HE BEGAN TO ACT OUT THE CHANGE IN HIS APPEARANCE WHICH CORRESPONDED WITH THE ASSUMPTION OF CONTROL BY THE EVIL WITHIN
679-155529-0044 WENT THROUGH CONTORTIONS WHICH WERE HORRIBLE YET FASCINATING IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH A NEW FEARFUL BEING WAS CREATED WITHIN SIGHT OF THE ONLOOKERS NOT ONLY WAS THE FACE ALTERED BUT THE MAN'S STATURE SEEMED TO SHRINK
679-155529-0045 TO LOSE ACTUAL INCHES I THOUGHT IT A WONDERFUL EXHIBITION THE VERY NEXT INSTANT THERE CAME A GROAN FROM SHIRLEY SOMETHING WHICH AT ONCE INDICATED PAIN AND REALIZATION AND FEAR HE LOST ALL CONTROL OF HIMSELF
679-155529-0046 AND IN A MOMENT PITCHED FORWARD UPON THE FLOOR SPUTTERING AND CLUTCHING AT THE EMPTY AIR ANOTHER CRY BROKE FROM BETWEEN HIS LIPS A GHASTLY CONTRACTED SHRIEK AS TREBLE AS THOUGH FROM THE THROAT OF A WOMAN THIS WAS NO PART OF THE STORY NO SKILLFUL BIT OF ACTING
679-155529-0047 IT WAS REAL EVEN BEFORE I HAD GRASPED THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HAPPENING KENNEDY HAD DASHED FORWARD THE CAMERAS STILL WERE GRINDING AND THEY CAUGHT HIM AS HE KNEELED AT THE SIDE OF THE STRICKEN MAN HARDLY A SECOND AFTERWARD MACKAY AND I FOLLOWED
679-155529-0048 AND WERE AT KENNEDY'S SIDE KAUF AND THE OTHERS THEIR FACES WEIRDLY ASHEN CLUSTERED ABOUT IN FRIGHT A THIRD TIME THE INVISIBLE HAND HAD STRUCK AT A MEMBER OF THE COMPANY THE BLACK TERROR
679-155529-0049 WITH ALL THE HORROR WRITTEN INTO THAT STORY CONTAINED NOTHING AS FEARFUL AS THE MENACE TO THE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN ITS PRODUCTION SHIRLEY'S SKIN WAS COLD AND CLAMMY HIS FACE ALMOST RIGID WHILE CONSCIOUS HE WAS HELPLESS
679-155529-0050 KENNEDY FOUND THE LITTLE VIAL AND EXAMINED IT ATROPIN HE EJACULATED WALTER HE TURNED TO ME GET SOME PHYSOSTIGMIN QUICK HAVE MACKAY DRIVE YOU IT'S IT'S LIFE OR DEATH HERE I'LL WRITE IT DOWN PHYSOSTIGMIN
679-155529-0051 I HEARD A WOMAN'S SCREAM MARILYN DID SHE THINK HIM DEAD ONCE IN THE CAR HEADED FOR THE NEAREST DRUG STORE GRASPING WILDLY AT THE SIDE OR AT THE BACK OF THE SEAT EVERY FEW MOMENTS
679-155529-0052 AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SKIDDED AROUND CURVES AND LITERALLY HURDLED OBSTACLES I REMEMBERED A FORGOTTEN FACT ATROPIN THAT WAS BELLADONNA SIMPLY ANOTHER NAME FOR THE DRUG
679-155529-0053 SHIRLEY HAD PROCURED THE STUFF FOR USE IN HIS EYES NEVERTHELESS HE HAD BEEN AWARE UNDOUBTEDLY OF ITS DEADLY NATURE PASSING BY KENNEDY AND THE REST OF US HE HAD OVERHEARD KENNEDY STATE THAT THE MURDERER WOULD BE IDENTIFIED
679-155529-0054 AS SOON AS ALL COULD BE ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTION ROOM THE HEAVY MAN HAD NOT CARED TO FACE JUSTICE IN SO PROSAIC A MANNER WITH THE SAME SENSE OF THE MELODRAMATIC WHICH HAD LED HIM TO SLAY STELLA LAMAR IN THE TAKING OF A SCENE
679-155529-0055 WERNER IN THE PHOTOGRAPHING OF ANOTHER HE HAD PREFERRED SUICIDE AND HAD SELECTED THE MOST SPECTACULAR MOMENT POSSIBLE FOR HIS LAST UPON EARTH YES SHIRLEY WAS GUILTY RATHER THAN WAIT
679-155529-0056 THE SLOW PROCESSES OF LEGAL JUSTICE HE HAD ATTEMPTED SUICIDE NOW WE RACED TO SAVE HIS LIFE TO PRESERVE IT FOR A MORE FITTING END
