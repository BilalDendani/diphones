3179-7133-0028 IT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING INDEED WHEN YOU TRY TO EAT A LUMP COMES RIGHT UP IN YOUR THROAT AND YOU CAN'T SWALLOW ANYTHING NOT EVEN IF IT WAS A CHOCOLATE CARAMEL
3179-7133-0029 I'VE OFTEN DREAMED SINCE THEN THAT I HAD A LOT OF CHOCOLATE CARAMELS BUT
3179-7133-0030 I DO HOPE YOU WON'T BE OFFENDED BECAUSE I CAN'T EAT EVERYTHING IS EXTREMELY NICE BUT STILL I CANNOT EAT I GUESS SHE'S TIRED SAID MATTHEW
3179-7133-0031 BEST PUT HER TO BED MARILLA MARILLA HAD BEEN WONDERING WHERE ANNE SHOULD BE PUT TO BED
3179-7133-0032 BUT ALTHOUGH IT WAS NEAT AND CLEAN IT DID NOT SEEM QUITE THE THING TO PUT A GIRL THERE SOMEHOW BUT THE SPARE ROOM WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR SUCH A STRAY WAIF SO THERE REMAINED ONLY THE EAST GABLE ROOM MARILLA LIGHTED A CANDLE AND TOLD ANNE TO FOLLOW HER WHICH ANNE SPIRITLESSLY DID
3179-7133-0033 THE HALL WAS FEARSOMELY CLEAN THE LITTLE GABLE CHAMBER IN WHICH SHE PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF SEEMED STILL CLEANER MARILLA SET THE CANDLE ON A THREE LEGGED THREE CORNERED TABLE AND TURNED DOWN THE BEDCLOTHES I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A NIGHTGOWN SHE QUESTIONED
3179-7133-0034 ANNE NODDED YES I HAVE TWO THE MATRON OF THE ASYLUM MADE THEM FOR ME
3179-7133-0035 SO THINGS ARE ALWAYS SKIMPY AT LEAST IN A POOR ASYLUM LIKE OURS I HATE SKIMPY NIGHT DRESSES BUT ONE CAN DREAM JUST AS WELL IN THEM
3179-7133-0036 WITH FRILLS AROUND THE NECK THAT'S ONE CONSOLATION WELL UNDRESS AS QUICK AS YOU CAN AND GO TO BED I'LL COME BACK IN A FEW MINUTES FOR THE CANDLE
3179-7133-0037 YOU'D LIKELY SET THE PLACE ON FIRE WHEN MARILLA HAD GONE ANNE LOOKED AROUND HER WISTFULLY THE WHITEWASHED WALLS WERE SO PAINFULLY BARE AND STARING THAT SHE THOUGHT THEY MUST ACHE OVER THEIR OWN BARENESS THE FLOOR WAS BARE TOO
3179-7133-0038 BRAIDED MAT IN THE MIDDLE SUCH AS ANNE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN ONE CORNER WAS THE BED A HIGH OLD FASHIONED ONE WITH FOUR DARK LOW TURNED POSTS IN THE OTHER CORNER WAS THE AFORESAID THREE CORNER TABLE ADORNED WITH A FAT RED VELVET PIN CUSHION
3179-7133-0039 ABOVE IT HUNG A LITTLE SIX BY EIGHT MIRROR MIDWAY BETWEEN TABLE AND BED WAS THE WINDOW
3179-7133-0040 PLACED THEM NEATLY ON A PRIM YELLOW CHAIR AND THEN TAKING UP THE CANDLE WENT OVER TO THE BED GOOD NIGHT SHE SAID A LITTLE AWKWARDLY BUT NOT UNKINDLY ANNE'S WHITE FACE AND BIG EYES APPEARED OVER THE BEDCLOTHES WITH A STARTLING SUDDENNESS HOW CAN YOU CALL IT A
3179-7133-0041 MARILLA WENT SLOWLY DOWN TO THE KITCHEN AND PROCEEDED TO WASH THE SUPPER DISHES MATTHEW WAS SMOKING A SURE SIGN OF PERTURBATION OF MIND HE SELDOM SMOKED FOR MARILLA SET HER FACE AGAINST IT AS A FILTHY HABIT BUT AT CERTAIN TIMES AND SEASONS HE FELT DRIVEN TO IT
3179-7133-0042 REALIZING THAT A MERE MAN MUST HAVE SOME VENT FOR HIS EMOTIONS WELL THIS IS A PRETTY KETTLE OF FISH SHE SAID WRATHFULLY THIS IS WHAT COMES OF SENDING WORD INSTEAD OF GOING OURSELVES RICHARD SPENCER'S FOLKS HAVE TWISTED THAT MESSAGE SOMEHOW
3179-7133-0043 ONE OF US WILL HAVE TO DRIVE OVER AND SEE MISSUS SPENCER TOMORROW THAT'S CERTAIN
3179-7133-0044 YES I SUPPOSE SO SAID MATTHEW RELUCTANTLY YOU SUPPOSE SO DON'T YOU KNOW IT
3179-7133-0045 IT'S KIND OF A PITY TO SEND HER BACK WHEN SHE'S SO SET ON STAYING HERE
3179-7133-0046 MARILLA'S ASTONISHMENT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN GREATER IF MATTHEW HAD EXPRESSED A PREDILECTION FOR STANDING ON HIS HEAD
3179-7133-0047 NOW NO I SUPPOSE NOT NOT EXACTLY STAMMERED MATTHEW UNCOMFORTABLY DRIVEN INTO A CORNER FOR HIS PRECISE MEANING I SUPPOSE WE COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO KEEP HER
3179-7133-0048 I CAN SEE AS PLAIN AS PLAIN THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP HER
3179-7133-0049 PERSISTED MATTHEW YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER TALK COMING FROM THE STATION OH SHE CAN TALK FAST ENOUGH I SAW THAT AT ONCE IT'S NOTHING IN HER FAVOUR EITHER I DON'T LIKE CHILDREN WHO HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY
3179-7133-0050 AND IF I DID SHE ISN'T THE STYLE I'D PICK OUT THERE'S SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT HER
3179-7133-0051 I'M NOT SUFFERING FOR COMPANY SAID MARILLA SHORTLY
3179-7133-0052 IT'S JUST AS YOU SAY OF COURSE MARILLA SAID MATTHEW RISING AND PUTTING HIS PIPE AWAY I'M GOING TO BED
