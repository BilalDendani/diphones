5682-32877-0009 IT IS NOT FOR THE CHILD I NURSED TO SAY THAT SAID TAMAR THERE WERE SCANDALOUS STORIES OF WICKED OLD TIBERIUS BANKRUPT DEAD AND BURIED COMPROMISING THE FAME OF TAMAR NOT ALWAYS A SPECTACLED AND CADAVEROUS STUDENT OF HOLY WRIT
5682-32877-0010 THESE INDEED WERE EVEN IN STANLEY'S CHILDHOOD OLD WORLD HAZY TRADITIONS OF THE SERVANTS HALL BUT BOYS HEAR OFTEN MORE THAN IS GOOD AND MORE THAN GOSPEL WHO LIVE IN SUCH HOUSES AS OLD GENERAL LAKE THE OLD MILLIONAIRE WIDOWER KEPT

5682-32877-0012 I DON'T THINK YOUR BIBLE TEACHES YOU ANYWHERE TO HURT YOUR NEIGHBOUR AND TO BREAK FAITH DON'T SPEAK OF THE BIBLE NOW BUT YOU NEEDN'T FEAR ME MASTER STANLEY ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN A LITTLE STERNLY
5682-32877-0013 POOR MISS RADIE SHE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BUT WHAT WAS GOOD FROM OLD TAMAR WHATEVER I MIGHT HA BIN MYSELF MISERABLE SINNERS ARE WE ALL AND I'LL DO AS YOU BID ME AND I HAVE DONE MASTER STANLEY
5682-32877-0014 BUT WE GET ROUGH WAYS IN THE ARMY I'M AFRAID AND YOU WON'T MIND ME YOU NEVER DID MIND LITTLE STANNIE WHEN HE WAS NAUGHTY YOU KNOW THERE WAS HERE A LITTLE SUBSIDENCE IN HIS SPEECH
5682-32877-0015 BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL REASONS AGAINST IT SO THAT HANDSOME COIN REMAINED IN HIS PURSE AND I FORGOT TO TELL YOU TAMAR I'VE A RING FOR YOU IN TOWN A LITTLE SOUVENIR YOU'LL THINK IT PRETTY A GOLD RING WITH A STONE IN IT
5682-32877-0016 IT BELONGED TO POOR DEAR AUNT JEMIMA YOU REMEMBER I LEFT IT BEHIND SO STUPID
5682-32877-0017 AS HE WALKED DOWN THE MILL ROAD TOWARD THE TOWN HE MET LORD CHELFORD ON HIS WAY TO MAKE ENQUIRY ABOUT RACHEL AT REDMAN'S FARM AND LAKE WHO AS WE KNOW HAD JUST SEEN HIS SISTER GAVE HIM ALL PARTICULARS CHELFORD LIKE THE LAWYER
5682-32877-0018 HAD HEARD FROM MARK WYLDER THAT MORNING A FEW LINES POSTPONING HIS RETURN HE MERELY MENTIONED IT AND MADE NO COMMENT BUT LAKE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS ANNOYED AT HIS UNEXPLAINED ABSENCE LAKE DINED AT BRANDON THAT EVENING AND THOUGH LOOKING ILL WAS
5682-32877-0019 VERY GOOD COMPANY AND PROMISED TO BRING AN EARLY REPORT OF RACHEL'S CONVALESCENCE IN THE MORNING I HAVE LITTLE TO RECORD OF NEXT DAY EXCEPT THAT LARKIN RECEIVED ANOTHER LONDON LETTER WYLDER PLAINLY WROTE IN GREAT HASTE AND MERELY SAID I SHALL HAVE TO WAIT A DAY OR
5682-32877-0020 TWO LONGER THAN I YESTERDAY THOUGHT TO MEET A FELLOW FROM WHOM I AM TO RECEIVE SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE RATHER AS I THINK TO ME GET THE DEEDS READY AS I SAID IN MY LAST IF I AM NOT IN GYLINGDEN BY MONDAY WE MUST PUT OFF THE WEDDING FOR A WEEK LATER
5682-32877-0021 THIS NOTE WAS AS UNCEREMONIOUS AND STILL SHORTER LORD CHELFORD WOULD HAVE WRITTEN AT ONCE TO REMONSTRATE WITH MARK ON THE UNSEEMLINESS OF PUTTING OFF HIS MARRIAGE SO CAPRICIOUSLY OR AT ALL EVENTS SO MYSTERIOUSLY
5682-32877-0022 MISS BRANDON NOT BEING CONSIDERED NOR HER FRIENDS CONSULTED BUT MARK HAD A DECIDED OBJECTION TO MANY LETTERS HE HAD NO FANCY TO BE WORRIED WHEN HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND BY PROSY REMONSTRANCES AND HE SHUT OUT THE WHOLE
5682-32877-0023 WYLDER WAS HIDDEN FROM MORTAL SIGHT LIKE A HEAVEN PROTECTED HERO IN THE ILIAD AND A CLOUD OF INVISIBILITY GIRDLED HIM LIKE MOST RUSTIC COMMUNITIES GYLINGDEN AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WERE EARLY IN BED FEW LIGHTS BURNED AFTER HALF PAST TEN AND THE WHOLE VICINITY
5682-32877-0024 WAS DEEP IN ITS SLUMBERS BEFORE TWELVE O'CLOCK AT THAT DREAD HOUR CAPTAIN LAKE ABOUT A MILE ON THE DOLLINGTON WHICH WAS THE OLD LONDON ROAD FROM GYLINGDEN WAS PACING BACKWARD AND FORWARD UNDER THE TOWERING FILES OF BEECH THAT OVERARCH IT AT THAT POINT
5682-32877-0025 THE WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC WITH A WIDE PANEL OVER ITS DOOR PRESENTING IN TINTS SUBDUED BY TIME A STAGE COACH AND FOUR HORSES IN MID CAREER LAY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS NEARER TO GYLINGDEN
5682-32877-0026 OF NATURE WAS TO BE HEARD STANLEY LAKE DID NOT LIKE WAITING ANY MORE THAN DID LOUIS
5682-32877-0027 OF ACTING SENTRY AND WAS VERY PEEVISH BY THE TIME THE RING OF WHEELS AND HORSE HOOFS APPROACHING FROM THE LONDON DIRECTION BECAME AUDIBLE EVEN SO HE HAD A LONGER WAIT THAN HE EXPECTED
5682-32877-0028 HALLO THERE I SAY A PASSENGER FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
5682-32877-0029 WELL I'LL PAY YOU HALF FARE TO BRING ME THERE ALL RIGHT SIR BUT THE OSS SIR MUST AV IS OATS FUST FEED HIM HERE THEN THEY ARE ALL ASLEEP IN THE WHITE HOUSE
5682-32877-0030 MUST NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND I MUST GO BACK WITH HIM
5682-32877-0031 INDEED I'VE BEEN I MAY SAY VERY ILL AND I TOLD THAT FELLOW LARKIN WHO HAS HIS EYES ABOUT HIM AND WOULD WONDER WHAT KEPT ME OUT SO LATE THAT I WOULD RUN DOWN TO SOME OF THE PLACES NEAR FOR A CHANGE AND SLEEP A NIGHT THERE
