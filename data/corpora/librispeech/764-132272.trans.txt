764-132272-0000 REVENGE IS A KIND OF WILD JUSTICE WHICH THE MORE MAN'S NATURE RUNS TO THE MORE OUGHT LAW TO WEED IT OUT FOR AS FOR THE FIRST WRONG IT DOTH BUT OFFEND THE LAW
764-132272-0001 WHICH PRICK AND SCRATCH BECAUSE THEY CAN DO NO OTHER THE MOST TOLERABLE SORT OF REVENGE
764-132272-0002 ELSE A MAN'S ENEMY IS STILL BEFORE HAND AND IT IS TWO FOR ONE SOME WHEN THEY TAKE REVENGE ARE DESIROUS THE PARTY SHOULD KNOW WHENCE IT COMETH THIS IS THE MORE GENEROUS FOR THE DELIGHT SEEMETH TO BE
764-132272-0003 NOT SO MUCH IN DOING THE HURT AS IN MAKING THE PARTY REPENT BUT BASE AND CRAFTY COWARDS ARE LIKE THE ARROW THAT FLIETH IN THE DARK
764-132272-0004 COSMUS DUKE OF FLORENCE HAD A DESPERATE SAYING AGAINST PERFIDIOUS OR NEGLECTING FRIENDS AS IF THOSE WRONGS WERE UNPARDONABLE YOU SHALL READ SAITH HE THAT WE ARE COMMANDED TO FORGIVE OUR ENEMIES
764-132272-0005 BUT YOU NEVER READ THAT WE ARE COMMANDED TO FORGIVE OUR FRIENDS BUT YET THE SPIRIT OF JOB WAS IN A BETTER TUNE
764-132272-0006 TAKE GOOD AT GOD'S HANDS AND NOT BE CONTENT TO TAKE EVIL ALSO AND SO OF FRIENDS IN A PROPORTION THIS IS CERTAIN THAT A MAN THAT STUDIETH REVENGE KEEPS HIS OWN WOUNDS GREEN
764-132272-0007 WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD HEAL AND DO WELL PUBLIC REVENGES ARE FOR THE MOST PART FORTUNATE AS THAT FOR THE DEATH OF CAESAR FOR THE DEATH OF PERTINAX FOR THE DEATH OF HENRY THE THIRD OF FRANCE AND MANY MORE
764-132272-0008 BUT IN PRIVATE REVENGES IT IS NOT SO NAY RATHER VINDICTIVE PERSONS LIVE THE LIFE OF WITCHES WHO AS THEY ARE MISCHIEVOUS SO END THEY INFORTUNATE
764-132272-0009 OF ADVERSITY IT WAS AN HIGH SPEECH OF SENECA AFTER THE MANNER OF THE STOICS THAT THE GOOD THINGS WHICH BELONG TO PROSPERITY ARE TO BE WISHED BUT THE GOOD THINGS THAT BELONG TO ADVERSITY ARE TO BE ADMIRED
764-132272-0010 THIS WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER IN POESY WHERE TRANSCENDENCES ARE MORE ALLOWED AND THE POETS INDEED HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH IT FOR IT IS IN EFFECT THE THING WHICH FIGURED IN THAT STRANGE FICTION OF THE ANCIENT POETS
764-132272-0011 WHICH SEEMETH NOT TO BE WITHOUT MYSTERY NAY AND TO HAVE SOME APPROACH TO THE STATE OF A CHRISTIAN THAT HERCULES WHEN HE WENT TO UNBIND PROMETHEUS BY WHOM HUMAN NATURE IS REPRESENTED
764-132272-0012 SAILED THE LENGTH OF THE GREAT OCEAN IN AN EARTHEN POT OR PITCHER LIVELY DESCRIBING CHRISTIAN RESOLUTION THAT SAILETH IN THE FRAIL BARK OF THE FLESH THROUGH THE WAVES OF THE WORLD BUT TO SPEAK IN A MEAN
764-132272-0013 THE VIRTUE OF PROSPERITY IS TEMPERANCE THE VIRTUE OF ADVERSITY IS FORTITUDE WHICH IN MORALS IS THE MORE HEROICAL VIRTUE PROSPERITY IS THE BLESSING OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ADVERSITY IS THE BLESSING OF THE NEW
764-132272-0014 WHICH CARRIETH THE GREATER BENEDICTION AND THE CLEARER REVELATION OF GOD'S FAVOR YET EVEN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IF YOU LISTEN TO DAVID'S HARP YOU SHALL HEAR AS MANY HEARSE LIKE AIRS AS CAROLS AND THE PENCIL OF THE HOLY GHOST
764-132272-0015 WE SEE IN NEEDLE WORKS AND EMBROIDERIES IT IS MORE PLEASING TO HAVE A LIVELY WORK UPON A SAD AND SOLEMN GROUND THAN TO HAVE A DARK AND MELANCHOLY WORK UPON A LIGHTSOME GROUND JUDGE THEREFORE OF THE PLEASURE OF THE HEART
764-132272-0016 BY THE PLEASURE OF THE EYE CERTAINLY VIRTUE IS LIKE PRECIOUS ODORS MOST FRAGRANT WHEN THEY ARE INCENSED OR CRUSHED FOR PROSPERITY DOTH BEST DISCOVER VICE BUT ADVERSITY DOTH BEST DISCOVER VIRTUE
764-132272-0017 THEREFORE IT IS THE WEAKER SORT OF POLITICS THAT ARE THE GREAT DISSEMBLERS TACITUS SAITH LIVIA SORTED WELL WITH THE ARTS OF HER HUSBAND AND DISSIMULATION OF HER SON ATTRIBUTING ARTS OR POLICY TO AUGUSTUS
764-132272-0018 AND DISSIMULATION TO TIBERIUS
764-132272-0019 TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST VITELLIUS HE SAITH WE RISE NOT AGAINST THE PIERCING JUDGMENT OF AUGUSTUS NOR THE EXTREME CAUTION OR CLOSENESS OF TIBERIUS THESE PROPERTIES OF ARTS OR POLICY
764-132272-0020 AND WHAT TO BE SHOWED AT HALF LIGHTS AND TO WHOM AND WHEN WHICH INDEED ARE ARTS OF STATE AND ARTS OF LIFE AS TACITUS WELL CALLETH THEM TO HIM A HABIT OF DISSIMULATION IS A HINDERANCE AND A POORNESS
764-132272-0021 CERTAINLY THE ABLEST MEN THAT EVER WERE HAVE HAD ALL AN OPENNESS AND FRANKNESS OF DEALING
764-132272-0022 BUT THEN THEY WERE LIKE HORSES WELL MANAGED FOR THEY COULD TELL PASSING WELL WHEN TO STOP OR TURN AND AT SUCH TIMES WHEN THEY THOUGHT THE CASE INDEED REQUIRED DISSIMULATION IF THEN THEY USED IT IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE FORMER OPINION SPREAD ABROAD
764-132272-0023 OF THEIR GOOD FAITH AND CLEARNESS OF DEALING MADE THEM ALMOST INVISIBLE THERE BE THREE DEGREES OF THIS HIDING AND VEILING OF A MAN'S SELF THE FIRST CLOSENESS RESERVATION AND SECRECY
764-132272-0024 AND ASSUREDLY THE SECRET MAN HEARETH MANY CONFESSIONS FOR WHO WILL OPEN HIMSELF TO A BLAB OR A BABBLER BUT IF A MAN BE THOUGHT SECRET IT INVITETH DISCOVERY AS THE MORE CLOSE AIR SUCKETH IN THE MORE OPEN
764-132272-0025 AND AS IN CONFESSION THE REVEALING IS NOT FOR WORLDLY USE BUT FOR THE EASE OF A MAN'S HEART SO SECRET MEN COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANY THINGS IN THAT KIND WHILE MEN RATHER DISCHARGE THEIR MINDS THAN IMPART THEIR MINDS
764-132272-0026 IN FEW WORDS MYSTERIES ARE DUE TO SECRECY BESIDES TO SAY TRUTH NAKEDNESS IS UNCOMELY AS WELL IN MIND AS BODY
764-132272-0027 AND IT ADDETH NO SMALL REVERENCE TO MEN'S MANNERS AND ACTIONS IF THEY BE NOT ALTOGETHER OPEN AS FOR TALKERS AND FUTILE PERSONS THEY ARE COMMONLY VAIN AND CREDULOUS WITHAL FOR HE THAT TALKETH WHAT HE KNOWETH
764-132272-0028 WILL ALSO TALK WHAT HE KNOWETH NOT THEREFORE SET IT DOWN THAT AN HABIT OF SECRECY IS BOTH POLITIC AND MORAL AND IN THIS PART IT IS GOOD THAT A MAN'S FACE GIVE HIS TONGUE LEAVE TO SPEAK
764-132272-0029 IT FOLLOWETH MANY TIMES UPON SECRECY BY A NECESSITY SO THAT HE THAT WILL BE SECRET MUST BE A DISSEMBLER IN SOME DEGREE FOR MEN ARE TOO CUNNING TO SUFFER A MAN TO KEEP AN INDIFFERENT CARRIAGE BETWEEN BOTH
764-132272-0030 THEY WILL GATHER AS MUCH BY HIS SILENCE AS BY HIS SPEECH AS FOR EQUIVOCATIONS OR ORACULOUS SPEECHES THEY CANNOT HOLD OUT LONG SO THAT NO MAN CAN BE SECRET EXCEPT HE GIVE HIMSELF A LITTLE SCOPE OF DISSIMULATION WHICH IS
764-132272-0031 AS IT WERE BUT THE SKIRTS OR TRAIN OF SECRECY BUT FOR THE THIRD DEGREE WHICH IS SIMULATION AND FALSE PROFESSION THAT I HOLD MORE CULPABLE AND LESS POLITIC EXCEPT IT BE IN GREAT AND RARE MATTERS AND THEREFORE
764-132272-0032 A GENERAL CUSTOM OF SIMULATION WHICH IS THIS LAST DEGREE IS A VICE USING EITHER OF A NATURAL FALSENESS OR FEARFULNESS OR OF A MIND THAT HATH SOME MAIN FAULTS WHICH BECAUSE A MAN MUST NEEDS DISGUISE
764-132272-0033 IT MAKETH HIM PRACTISE SIMULATION IN OTHER THINGS LEST HIS HAND SHOULD BE OUT OF USE THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF SIMULATION AND DISSIMULATION ARE THREE FIRST TO LAY ASLEEP OPPOSITION AND TO SURPRISE
764-132272-0034 FOR WHERE A MAN'S INTENTIONS ARE PUBLISHED IT IS AN ALARUM TO CALL UP ALL THAT ARE AGAINST THEM THE SECOND IS TO RESERVE TO A MAN'S SELF A FAIR RETREAT FOR IF A MAN ENGAGE HIMSELF BY A MANIFEST DECLARATION
764-132272-0035 HE MUST GO THROUGH OR TAKE A FALL THE THIRD IS THE BETTER TO DISCOVER THE MIND OF ANOTHER FOR TO HIM THAT OPENS HIMSELF MEN WILL HARDLY SHOW THEMSELVES ADVERSE BUT WILL FAIR LET HIM GO ON AND TURN THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
764-132272-0036 AND THEREFORE IT IS A GOOD SHREWD PROVERB OF THE SPANIARD TELL A LIE AND FIND A TROTH AS IF THERE WERE NO WAY OF DISCOVERY BUT BY SIMULATION THERE BE ALSO THREE DISADVANTAGES TO SET IT EVEN THE FIRST
764-132272-0037 THAT SIMULATION AND DISSIMULATION COMMONLY CARRY WITH THEM A SHOW OF FEARFULNESS WHICH IN ANY BUSINESS DOTH SPOIL THE FEATHERS OF ROUND FLYING UP TO THE MARK THE SECOND THAT IT PUZZLETH AND PERPLEXETH THE CONCEITS OF MANY
764-132272-0038 THE BEST COMPOSITION AND TEMPERATURE IS TO HAVE OPENNESS IN FAME AND OPINION SECRECY IN HABIT DISSIMULATION IN SEASONABLE USE AND A POWER TO FEIGN IF THERE BE NO REMEDY
764-132272-0039 BUT MEMORY MERIT AND NOBLE WORKS ARE PROPER TO MEN AND SURELY A MAN SHALL SEE THE NOBLEST WORKS AND FOUNDATIONS HAVE PROCEEDED FROM CHILDLESS MEN WHICH HAVE SOUGHT TO EXPRESS THE IMAGES OF THEIR MINDS WHERE THOSE OF THEIR BODIES HAVE FAILED
764-132272-0040 BUT OF THEIR WORK AND SO BOTH CHILDREN AND CREATURES THE DIFFERENCE IN AFFECTION OF PARENTS TOWARDS THEIR SEVERAL CHILDREN IS MANY TIMES UNEQUAL AND SOMETIMES UNWORTHY ESPECIALLY IN THE MOTHERS AS SOLOMON SAITH
764-132272-0041 A WISE SON REJOICETH THE FATHER BUT AN UNGRACIOUS SON SHAMES THE MOTHER A MAN SHALL SEE WHERE THERE IS A HOUSE FULL OF CHILDREN ONE OR TWO OF THE ELDEST RESPECTED AND THE YOUNGEST MADE WANTONS BUT IN THE MIDST
764-132272-0042 WHO MANY TIMES NEVERTHELESS PROVE THE BEST THE ILLIBERALITY OF PARENTS IN ALLOWANCE TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN IS AN HARMFUL ERROR MAKES THEM BASE ACQUAINTS THEM WITH SHIFTS MAKES THEM SORT WITH MEAN COMPANY
764-132272-0043 AND MAKES THEM SURFEIT MORE WHEN THEY COME TO PLENTY AND THEREFORE THE PROOF IS BEST WHEN MEN KEEP THEIR AUTHORITY TOWARDS THE CHILDREN BUT NOT THEIR PURSE MEN HAVE A FOOLISH MANNER BOTH PARENTS AND SCHOOLMASTERS AND SERVANTS
764-132272-0044 IN CREATING AND BREEDING AN EMULATION BETWEEN BROTHERS DURING CHILDHOOD WHICH MANY TIMES SORTETH TO DISCORD WHEN THEY ARE MEN AND DISTURBETH FAMILIES
764-132272-0045 BUT SO THEY BE OF THE LUMP THEY CARE NOT THOUGH THEY PASS NOT THROUGH THEIR OWN BODY AND TO SAY TRUTH IN NATURE IT IS MUCH A LIKE MATTER INSOMUCH THAT WE SEE A NEPHEW SOMETIMES RESEMBLETH AN UNCLE OR A KINSMAN
764-132272-0046 AND LET THEM NOT TOO MUCH APPLY THEMSELVES TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR CHILDREN AS THINKING THEY WILL TAKE BEST TO THAT
764-132272-0047 IT IS TRUE THAT IF THE AFFECTION OR APTNESS OF THE CHILDREN BE EXTRAORDINARY THEN IT IS GOOD NOT TO CROSS IT BUT GENERALLY THE PRECEPT IS GOOD OPTIMUM
764-132272-0048 SHOULD HAVE GREATEST CARE OF FUTURE TIMES UNTO WHICH THEY KNOW THEY MUST TRANSMIT THEIR DEAREST PLEDGES SOME THERE ARE WHO THOUGH THEY LEAD A SINGLE LIFE
764-132272-0049 YET THEIR THOUGHTS DO END WITH THEMSELVES AND ACCOUNT FUTURE TIMES IMPERTINENCES NAY THERE ARE SOME OTHER THAT ACCOUNT WIFE AND CHILDREN BUT AS BILLS OF CHARGES NAY MORE
764-132272-0050 THERE ARE SOME FOOLISH RICH COVETOUS MEN THAT TAKE A PRIDE IN HAVING NO CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY MAY BE THOUGHT SO MUCH THE RICHER FOR PERHAPS THEY HAVE HEARD SOME TALK SUCH AN ONE IS A GREAT RICH MAN
764-132272-0051 AND ANOTHER EXCEPT TO IT YEA BUT HE HATH A GREAT CHARGE OF CHILDREN AS IF IT WERE AN ABATEMENT TO HIS RICHES BUT THE MOST ORDINARY CAUSE OF A SINGLE LIFE IS LIBERTY
764-132272-0052 ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN SELF PLEASING AND HUMOROUS MINDS WHICH ARE SO SENSIBLE OF EVERY RESTRAINT AS THEY WILL GO NEAR TO THINK THEIR GIRDLES AND GARTERS TO BE BONDS AND SHACKLES UNMARRIED MEN ARE BEST FRIENDS
764-132272-0053 FOR CHARITY WILL HARDLY WATER THE GROUND WHERE IT MUST FIRST FILL A POOL IT IS INDIFFERENT FOR JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES FOR IF THEY BE FACILE AND CORRUPT YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT FIVE TIMES WORSE THAN A WIFE
764-132272-0054 FOR SOLDIERS I FIND THE GENERALS COMMONLY IN THEIR HORTATIVES PUT MEN IN MIND OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN AND I THINK THE DESPISING OF MARRIAGE AMONGST THE TURKS MAKETH THE VULGAR SOLDIER MORE BASE
764-132272-0055 BECAUSE THEIR MEANS ARE LESS EXHAUST YET ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY ARE MORE CRUEL AND HARDHEARTED GOOD TO MAKE SEVERE INQUISITORS BECAUSE THEIR TENDERNESS IS NOT SO OFT CALLED UPON
764-132272-0056 GRAVE NATURES LED BY CUSTOM AND THEREFORE CONSTANT ARE COMMONLY LOVING HUSBANDS AS WAS SAID OF ULYSSES VETULAM SUAM PRAETULIT IMMORTALITATI CHASTE WOMEN
764-132272-0057 WHETHER IT BE THAT IT RAISETH THE PRICE OF THEIR HUSBAND'S KINDNESS WHEN IT COMES OR THAT THE WIVES TAKE A PRIDE IN THEIR PATIENCE BUT THIS NEVER FAILS IF THE BAD HUSBANDS WERE OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING AGAINST THEIR FRIENDS CONSENT
