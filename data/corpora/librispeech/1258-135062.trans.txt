1258-135062-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THESE THINGS HAPPENED LAST WINTER SIR SAID MISSUS DEAN HARDLY MORE THAN A YEAR AGO LAST WINTER I DID NOT THINK AT ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS END
1258-135062-0001 I SHOULD BE AMUSING A STRANGER TO THE FAMILY WITH RELATING THEM YET WHO KNOWS HOW LONG YOU'LL BE A STRANGER YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO REST ALWAYS CONTENTED LIVING BY YOURSELF AND I SOME WAY FANCY NO ONE COULD SEE CATHERINE LINTON AND NOT LOVE HER
1258-135062-0002 YOU SMILE BUT WHY DO YOU LOOK SO LIVELY AND INTERESTED WHEN I TALK ABOUT HER
1258-135062-0003 AND WHY STOP MY GOOD FRIEND I CRIED IT MAY BE VERY POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD LOVE HER BUT WOULD SHE LOVE ME I DOUBT IT TOO MUCH TO VENTURE MY TRANQUILLITY BY RUNNING INTO TEMPTATION
1258-135062-0004 AND THEN MY HOME IS NOT HERE I'M OF THE BUSY WORLD AND TO ITS ARMS I MUST RETURN GO ON WAS CATHERINE OBEDIENT TO HER FATHER'S COMMANDS SHE WAS CONTINUED THE HOUSEKEEPER
1258-135062-0005 HER AFFECTION FOR HIM WAS STILL THE CHIEF SENTIMENT IN HER HEART AND HE SPOKE WITHOUT ANGER HE SPOKE IN THE DEEP TENDERNESS OF ONE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIS TREASURE AMID PERILS AND FOES WHERE HIS REMEMBERED WORDS WOULD BE THE ONLY AID
1258-135062-0006 THAT HE COULD BEQUEATH TO GUIDE HER HE SAID TO ME A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS I WISH MY NEPHEW WOULD WRITE ELLEN OR CALL TELL ME SINCERELY WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM IS HE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER
1258-135062-0007 HE'S VERY DELICATE SIR I REPLIED AND SCARCELY LIKELY TO REACH MANHOOD BUT THIS I CAN SAY HE DOES NOT RESEMBLE HIS FATHER AND IF MISS CATHERINE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO MARRY HIM HE WOULD NOT BE BEYOND HER CONTROL
1258-135062-0008 UNLESS SHE WERE EXTREMELY AND FOOLISHLY INDULGENT HOWEVER MASTER YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH HIM AND SEE WHETHER HE WOULD SUIT HER IT WANTS FOUR YEARS AND MORE TO HIS BEING OF AGE EDGAR SIGHED
1258-135062-0009 AND WALKING TO THE WINDOW LOOKED OUT TOWARDS GIMMERTON KIRK IT WAS A MISTY AFTERNOON BUT THE FEBRUARY SUN SHONE DIMLY AND WE COULD JUST DISTINGUISH THE TWO FIR TREES IN THE YARD AND THE SPARELY SCATTERED GRAVESTONES
1258-135062-0010 I'VE PRAYED OFTEN HE HALF SOLILOQUISED FOR THE APPROACH OF WHAT IS COMING AND NOW I BEGIN TO SHRINK AND FEAR IT I THOUGHT THE MEMORY OF THE HOUR I CAME DOWN THAT GLEN A BRIDEGROOM
1258-135062-0011 WOULD BE LESS SWEET THAN THE ANTICIPATION THAT I WAS SOON IN A FEW MONTHS OR POSSIBLY WEEKS TO BE CARRIED UP AND LAID IN ITS LONELY HOLLOW ELLEN I'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH MY LITTLE CATHY
1258-135062-0012 THROUGH WINTER NIGHTS AND SUMMER DAYS SHE WAS A LIVING HOPE AT MY SIDE BUT I'VE BEEN AS HAPPY MUSING BY MYSELF AMONG THOSE STONES UNDER THAT OLD CHURCH LYING THROUGH THE LONG JUNE EVENINGS ON THE GREEN MOUND OF HER MOTHER'S GRAVE AND WISHING
1258-135062-0013 YEARNING FOR THE TIME WHEN I MIGHT LIE BENEATH IT WHAT CAN I DO FOR CATHY HOW MUST I QUIT HER I'D NOT CARE ONE MOMENT FOR LINTON BEING HEATHCLIFF'S SON NOR FOR HIS TAKING HER FROM ME
1258-135062-0014 I'D NOT CARE THAT HEATHCLIFF GAINED HIS ENDS AND TRIUMPHED IN ROBBING ME OF MY LAST BLESSING BUT SHOULD LINTON BE UNWORTHY ONLY A FEEBLE TOOL TO HIS FATHER I CANNOT ABANDON HER TO HIM AND
1258-135062-0015 DARLING I'D RATHER RESIGN HER TO GOD AND LAY HER IN THE EARTH BEFORE ME RESIGN HER TO GOD AS IT IS SIR I ANSWERED AND IF WE SHOULD LOSE YOU
1258-135062-0016 WHICH MAY HE FORBID UNDER HIS PROVIDENCE I'LL STAND HER FRIEND AND COUNSELLOR TO THE LAST MISS CATHERINE IS A GOOD GIRL I DON'T FEAR THAT SHE WILL GO WILFULLY WRONG AND PEOPLE WHO DO THEIR DUTY ARE ALWAYS FINALLY REWARDED
1258-135062-0017 SPRING ADVANCED YET MY MASTER GATHERED NO REAL STRENGTH THOUGH HE RESUMED HIS WALKS IN THE GROUNDS WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO HER INEXPERIENCED NOTIONS THIS ITSELF WAS A SIGN OF CONVALESCENCE
1258-135062-0018 AND THEN HIS CHEEK WAS OFTEN FLUSHED AND HIS EYES WERE BRIGHT SHE FELT SURE OF HIS RECOVERING ON HER SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY HE DID NOT VISIT THE CHURCHYARD IT WAS RAINING AND I OBSERVED
1258-135062-0019 HE ANSWERED
1258-135062-0020 HE WROTE AGAIN TO LINTON EXPRESSING HIS GREAT DESIRE TO SEE HIM AND HAD THE INVALID BEEN PRESENTABLE I'VE NO DOUBT HIS FATHER WOULD HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO COME AS IT WAS BEING INSTRUCTED HE RETURNED AN ANSWER
1258-135062-0021 BUT HIS UNCLE'S KIND REMEMBRANCE DELIGHTED HIM AND HE HOPED TO MEET HIM SOMETIMES IN HIS RAMBLES AND PERSONALLY TO PETITION THAT HIS COUSIN AND HE MIGHT NOT REMAIN LONG SO UTTERLY DIVIDED THAT PART OF HIS LETTER WAS SIMPLE
1258-135062-0022 AND PROBABLY HIS OWN HEATHCLIFF KNEW HE COULD PLEAD ELOQUENTLY FOR CATHERINE'S COMPANY THEN I DO NOT ASK HE SAID THAT SHE MAY VISIT HERE
1258-135062-0023 BUT AM I NEVER TO SEE HER BECAUSE MY FATHER FORBIDS ME TO GO TO HER HOME AND YOU FORBID HER TO COME TO MINE DO NOW AND THEN RIDE WITH HER TOWARDS THE HEIGHTS
1258-135062-0024 WE HAVE DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE THIS SEPARATION AND YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME YOU HAVE NO REASON TO DISLIKE ME YOU ALLOW YOURSELF DEAR UNCLE SEND ME A KIND NOTE TO MORROW
1258-135062-0025 AND LEAVE TO JOIN YOU ANYWHERE YOU PLEASE EXCEPT AT THRUSHCROSS GRANGE I BELIEVE AN INTERVIEW WOULD CONVINCE YOU THAT MY FATHER'S CHARACTER IS NOT MINE HE AFFIRMS I AM MORE YOUR NEPHEW THAN HIS SON
1258-135062-0026 AND THOUGH I HAVE FAULTS WHICH RENDER ME UNWORTHY OF CATHERINE SHE HAS EXCUSED THEM AND FOR HER SAKE YOU SHOULD ALSO YOU INQUIRE AFTER MY HEALTH IT IS BETTER BUT WHILE I REMAIN CUT OFF FROM ALL HOPE
1258-135062-0027 AND DOOMED TO SOLITUDE OR THE SOCIETY OF THOSE WHO NEVER DID AND NEVER WILL LIKE ME HOW CAN I BE CHEERFUL AND WELL EDGAR THOUGH HE FELT FOR THE BOY COULD NOT CONSENT TO GRANT HIS REQUEST
1258-135062-0028 BECAUSE HE COULD NOT ACCOMPANY CATHERINE HE SAID IN SUMMER PERHAPS THEY MIGHT MEET MEANTIME HE WISHED HIM TO CONTINUE WRITING AT INTERVALS AND ENGAGED TO GIVE HIM WHAT ADVICE AND COMFORT HE WAS ABLE BY LETTER
1258-135062-0029 BEING WELL AWARE OF HIS HARD POSITION IN HIS FAMILY LINTON COMPLIED AND HAD HE BEEN UNRESTRAINED WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SPOILED ALL BY FILLING HIS EPISTLES WITH COMPLAINTS AND LAMENTATIONS
1258-135062-0030 BUT HIS FATHER KEPT A SHARP WATCH OVER HIM AND OF COURSE INSISTED ON EVERY LINE THAT MY MASTER SENT BEING SHOWN SO INSTEAD OF PENNING HIS PECULIAR PERSONAL SUFFERINGS AND DISTRESSES THE THEMES CONSTANTLY UPPERMOST IN HIS THOUGHTS
1258-135062-0031 HE HARPED ON THE CRUEL OBLIGATION OF BEING HELD ASUNDER FROM HIS FRIEND AND LOVE AND GENTLY INTIMATED THAT MISTER LINTON MUST ALLOW AN INTERVIEW SOON OR HE SHOULD FEAR HE WAS PURPOSELY DECEIVING HIM WITH EMPTY PROMISES
1258-135062-0032 CATHY WAS A POWERFUL ALLY AT HOME AND BETWEEN THEM THEY AT LENGTH PERSUADED MY MASTER TO ACQUIESCE IN THEIR HAVING A RIDE OR A WALK TOGETHER
1258-135062-0033 FOR JUNE FOUND HIM STILL DECLINING THOUGH HE HAD SET ASIDE YEARLY A PORTION OF HIS INCOME FOR MY YOUNG LADY'S FORTUNE HE HAD A NATURAL DESIRE THAT SHE MIGHT RETAIN
1258-135062-0034 THE HOUSE OF HER ANCESTORS AND HE CONSIDERED HER ONLY PROSPECT OF DOING THAT WAS BY A UNION WITH HIS HEIR HE HAD NO IDEA THAT THE LATTER WAS FAILING ALMOST AS FAST AS HIMSELF NOR HAD ANY ONE I BELIEVE
1258-135062-0035 NO DOCTOR VISITED THE HEIGHTS AND NO ONE SAW MASTER HEATHCLIFF TO MAKE REPORT OF HIS CONDITION AMONG US I FOR MY PART BEGAN TO FANCY MY FOREBODINGS WERE FALSE AND THAT HE MUST BE ACTUALLY RALLYING
1258-135062-0036 AND SEEMED SO EARNEST IN PURSUING HIS OBJECT I COULD NOT PICTURE A FATHER TREATING A DYING CHILD AS TYRANNICALLY AND WICKEDLY AS I AFTERWARDS LEARNED HEATHCLIFF HAD TREATED HIM TO COMPEL THIS APPARENT EAGERNESS
