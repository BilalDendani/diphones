4595-45218-0008 AND I CONSIGNED THE INVENTOR OF PIANOS TO HIDEOUS TORMENT AS SCALES WERE PURSUED ENDLESSLY UP AND DOWN THE KEYS TWO GIRLS PASSING THROUGH THE HALL MADE A PRETEXT OF LOOKING FOR A BOOK AND CAME IN AND EXCLAIMED OVER THEIR INABILITY TO FIND IT WITH MUCH SUPPRESSED GIGGLING
4595-45218-0009 THE PIANO POUNDING CONTINUED AND I WAITED FOR WHAT SEEMED AN INTERMINABLE TIME IT WAS GROWING DARK AND A MAID LIGHTED THE OIL LAMPS I TOOK A BOOK FROM THE TABLE IT WAS THE LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI
4595-45218-0010 BY UNMISTAKABLY THE SAME HAND THAT PENNED THE APOLOGY FOR OLIVIAS PERFORMANCES I SAW IN THE CLEAR FLOWING LINES OF THE SIGNATURE IN THEIR LACK OF SUPERFLUITY HER OWN EASE GRACE AND CHARM
4595-45218-0011 AND I DROPPED THE BOOK IMPATIENTLY WHEN I HEARD HER STEP ON THE THRESHOLD I AM SORRY TO HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING MISTER GLENARM BUT THIS IS MY BUSY HOUR I SHALL NOT DETAIN YOU LONG I CAME I HESITATED NOT KNOWING WHY I HAD COME
4595-45218-0012 SHE TOOK A CHAIR NEAR THE OPEN DOOR AND BENT FORWARD WITH AN AIR OF ATTENTION THAT WAS DISQUIETING SHE WORE BLACKPERHAPS TO FIT HER THE BETTER INTO THE HOUSE OF A SOMBER SISTERHOOD I SEEMED SUDDENLY TO REMEMBER HER FROM A TIME LONG GONE AND THE EFFORT OF MEMORY THREW ME OFF GUARD
4595-45218-0013 STODDARD HAD SAID THERE WERE SEVERAL OLIVIA ARMSTRONGS THERE WERE CERTAINLY MANY MARIAN DEVEREUXS THE SILENCE GREW INTOLERABLE SHE WAS WAITING FOR ME TO SPEAK AND I BLURTED

4595-45218-0015 OH SHE SAID LINGERINGLY AS THOUGH SHE WERE FINDING WITH DIFFICULTY THE NOTE IN WHICH I WISHED TO PITCH THE CONVERSATION HER CALMNESS WAS MADDENING I SUPPOSE YOU THOUGHT IT UNWISE TO WAIT FOR THE BLUEBIRD WHEN YOU HAD BEGUILED ME INTO BREAKING A PROMISE
4595-45218-0016 WHEN I WAS TRAPPED DEFEATED HER ELBOW ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR HER HAND RESTING AGAINST HER CHECK THE LIGHT RIPPLING GOLDENLY IN HER HAIR HER EYES BENT UPON ME INQUIRINGLY MOURNFULLY MOURNFULLY AS I HAD SEEN THEMWHERE
4595-45218-0017 ONCE BEFORE MY HEART LEAPED IN THAT MOMENT WITH THAT THOUGHT I REMEMBER NOW THE FIRST TIME I EXCLAIMED MORE ANGRY THAN I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE IN MY LIFE THAT IS QUITE REMARKABLE SHE SAID AND NODDED HER HEAD IRONICALLY
4595-45218-0018 IT WAS AT SHERRYS YOU WERE WITH PICKERINGYOU
