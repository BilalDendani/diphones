2582-155972-0000 TEN DAYS LATER AT SAGAMORE HILL I WAS AMONG MY OWN BIRDS AND WAS MUCH INTERESTED AS I LISTENED TO AND LOOKED AT THEM IN REMEMBERING THE NOTES AND ACTIONS OF THE BIRDS I HAD SEEN IN ENGLAND
2582-155972-0001 ON THE EVENING OF THE FIRST DAY I SAT IN MY ROCKING CHAIR ON THE BROAD VERANDA LOOKING ACROSS THE SOUND TOWARDS THE GLORY OF THE SUNSET
2582-155972-0002 THE THICKLY GRASSED HILLSIDE SLOPED DOWN IN FRONT OF ME TO A BELT OF FOREST FROM WHICH ROSE THE GOLDEN LEISURELY CHIMING OF THE WOOD THRUSHES CHANTING THEIR VESPERS THROUGH THE STILL AIR CAME THE WARBLE OF VIREO AND TANAGER
2582-155972-0003 AND AFTER NIGHTFALL WE HEARD THE FLIGHT SONG OF AN OVENBIRD FROM THE SAME BELT OF TIMBER OVERHEAD AN ORIOLE SANG IN THE WEEPING ELM NOW AND THEN BREAKING HIS SONG TO SCOLD LIKE AN OVERGROWN WREN SONG SPARROWS AND CATBIRDS SANG IN THE SHRUBBERY
2582-155972-0004 AND THERE WAS A CHIPPY'S NEST IN THE WISTARIA VINE BY THE STOOP DURING THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS I SAW AND HEARD EITHER RIGHT AROUND THE HOUSE OR WHILE WALKING DOWN TO BATHE THROUGH THE WOODS THE FOLLOWING FORTY TWO BIRDS
2582-155972-0005 NIGHT HERON RED TAILED HAWK YELLOW BILLED CUCKOO KINGFISHER FLICKER HUMMING BIRD SWIFT MEADOW LARK RED WINGED BLACKBIRD SHARP TAILED FINCH
2582-155972-0006 SONG SPARROW CHIPPING SPARROW BUSH SPARROW PURPLE FINCH BALTIMORE ORIOLE COWBUNTING ROBIN WOOD THRUSH THRASHER CATBIRD SCARLET TANAGER
2582-155972-0007 RED EYED VIREO YELLOW WARBLER BLACK THROATED GREEN WARBLER KINGBIRD WOOD PEEWEE CROW BLUE JAY CEDAR BIRD MARYLAND YELLOWTHROAT CHICKADEE
2582-155972-0008 BLACK AND WHITE CREEPER BARN SWALLOW WHITE BREASTED SWALLOW OVENBIRD THISTLEFINCH VESPERFINCH INDIGO BUNTING TOWHEE GRASSHOPPER SPARROW AND SCREECH OWL
2582-155972-0009 THE BIRDS WERE STILL IN FULL SONG FOR ON LONG ISLAND THERE IS LITTLE ABATEMENT IN THE CHORUS UNTIL ABOUT THE SECOND WEEK OF JULY WHEN THE BLOSSOMING OF THE CHESTNUT TREES PATCHES THE WOODLAND WITH FROTHY GREENISH YELLOW
2582-155972-0010 ALAS THE BLIGHT HAS NOW DESTROYED THE CHESTNUT TREES AND ROBBED OUR WOODS OF ONE OF THEIR DISTINCTIVE BEAUTIES OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL SINGERS ARE THE WOOD THRUSHES THEY SING NOT ONLY IN THE EARLY MORNING BUT THROUGHOUT THE LONG HOT JUNE AFTERNOONS
2582-155972-0011 SOMETIMES THEY SING IN THE TREES IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE HOUSE AND IF THE AIR IS STILL WE CAN ALWAYS HEAR THEM FROM AMONG THE TALL TREES AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL THE THRASHERS SING IN THE HEDGEROWS BEYOND THE GARDEN THE CATBIRDS EVERYWHERE
2582-155972-0012 THE CATBIRDS HAVE SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE SONG THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IRRITATING TO KNOW THAT AT ANY MOMENT THEY MAY INTERRUPT IT TO MEW AND SQUEAL THE BOLD CHEERY MUSIC OF THE ROBINS ALWAYS SEEMS TYPICAL OF THE BOLD CHEERY BIRDS THEMSELVES
2582-155972-0013 THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES NEST IN THE YOUNG ELMS AROUND THE HOUSE AND THE ORCHARD ORIOLES IN THE APPLE TREES NEAR THE GARDEN AND OUTBUILDINGS AMONG THE EARLIEST SOUNDS OF SPRING IS THE CHEERFUL SIMPLE HOMELY SONG OF THE SONG SPARROW
2582-155972-0014 AMONG THE FINCHES ONE OF THE MOST MUSICAL AND PLAINTIVE SONGS IS THAT OF THE BUSH SPARROW I DO NOT KNOW WHY THE BOOKS CALL IT FIELD SPARROW FOR IT DOES NOT DWELL IN THE OPEN FIELDS LIKE THE VESPERFINCH THE SAVANNAH SPARROW
2582-155972-0015 AND GRASSHOPPER SPARROW BUT AMONG THE CEDARS AND BAYBERRY BUSHES AND YOUNG LOCUSTS IN THE SAME PLACES WHERE THE PRAIRIE WARBLER IS FOUND NOR IS IT ONLY THE TRUE SONGS THAT DELIGHT US WE LOVE TO HEAR THE FLICKERS CALL
2582-155972-0016 AND WE READILY PARDON ANY ONE OF THEIR NUMBER WHICH AS OCCASIONALLY HAPPENS IS BOLD ENOUGH TO WAKE US IN THE EARLY MORNING BY DRUMMING ON THE SHINGLES OF THE ROOF IN OUR EARS THE RED WINGED BLACKBIRDS HAVE A VERY ATTRACTIVE NOTE
2582-155972-0017 WE LOVE THE SCREAMING OF THE RED TAILED HAWKS AS THEY SOAR HIGH OVERHEAD AND EVEN THE CALLS OF THE NIGHT HERON THAT NEST IN THE TALL WATER MAPLES BY ONE OF THE WOOD PONDS ON OUR PLACE AND THE LITTLE GREEN HERONS THAT NEST BESIDE THE SALT MARSH
2582-155972-0018 A MAN WHO IS WORTH ANYTHING CAN NO MORE BE ENTIRELY IMPARTIAL IN SPEAKING OF THE BIRD SONGS WITH WHICH FROM HIS EARLIEST CHILDHOOD HE HAS BEEN FAMILIAR THAN HE CAN BE ENTIRELY IMPARTIAL IN SPEAKING OF HIS OWN FAMILY
2582-155972-0019 AT SAGAMORE HILL WE LOVE A GREAT MANY THINGS BIRDS AND TREES AND BOOKS AND ALL THINGS BEAUTIFUL AND HORSES AND RIFLES AND CHILDREN AND HARD WORK AND THE JOY OF LIFE WE HAVE GREAT FIREPLACES
2582-155972-0020 AS IN EVERY HOUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT APPEAL TO THE HOUSEHOLDER BECAUSE OF THEIR ASSOCIATIONS BUT WHICH WOULD NOT MEAN MUCH TO OTHERS NATURALLY ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN PRESIDENT AND FILLED OTHER POSITIONS ACCUMULATES SUCH THINGS
2582-155972-0021 WITH SCANT REGARD TO HIS OWN PERSONAL MERITS PERHAPS OUR MOST CHERISHED POSSESSIONS ARE A REMINGTON BRONZE THE BRONCO BUSTER GIVEN ME BY MY MEN WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS MUSTERED OUT
2582-155972-0022 AND A BIG TIFFANY SILVER VASE GIVEN TO MISSUS ROOSEVELT BY THE ENLISTED MEN OF THE BATTLESHIP LOUISIANA AFTER WE RETURNED FROM A CRUISE ON HER TO PANAMA IT WAS A REAL SURPRISE GIFT PRESENTED TO HER IN THE WHITE HOUSE ON BEHALF OF THE WHOLE CREW
2582-155972-0023 WHEN I WAS IN COMPANY WITH ADMIRAL EVANS AND CAPTAIN COWLES AND AGAIN ON THE SYLPH AND ON THE MAYFLOWER WE ALSO DINED AS GUESTS OF THE CREW WHEN WE FINISHED OUR TRIP ON THE LOUISIANA I MADE A SHORT SPEECH TO THE ASSEMBLED CREW
2582-155972-0024 NOW THEN MEN THREE CHEERS FOR THEODORE ROOSEVELT THE TYPICAL AMERICAN CITIZEN THAT WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THEY THOUGHT OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND A VERY GOOD WAY TOO
2582-155972-0025 IT WAS AN EXPRESSION THAT WOULD HAVE COME NATURALLY ONLY TO MEN IN WHOM THE AMERICAN PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT AND LIFE WERE INGRAINED JUST AS THEY WERE INGRAINED IN THE MEN OF MY REGIMENT I NEED SCARCELY ADD BUT I WILL ADD FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW
2582-155972-0026 THAT THIS ATTITUDE OF SELF RESPECTING IDENTIFICATION OF INTEREST AND PURPOSE IS NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH BUT CAN ONLY EXIST WHEN THERE IS FINE AND REAL DISCIPLINE AS THOROUGH AND GENUINE AS THE DISCIPLINE THAT HAS ALWAYS OBTAINED
2582-155972-0027 IN THE MOST FORMIDABLE FIGHTING FLEETS AND ARMIES
2582-155972-0028 NOT ANTAGONISTIC DURING THE PRESIDENCY ALL OF US BUT ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN BECAME CLOSE FRIENDS WITH MANY OF THE SAILOR MEN THE FOUR BEARERS OF THE VASE TO MISSUS ROOSEVELT WERE PROMPTLY HAILED AS DELIGHTFUL BIG BROTHERS BY OUR TWO SMALLEST BOYS
2582-155972-0029 WHO AT ONCE TOOK THEM TO SEE THE SIGHTS OF WASHINGTON IN THE LANDAU THE PRESIDENT'S LAND HO AS WITH SEAFARING HUMOR OUR GUESTS IMMEDIATELY STYLED IT ONCE AFTER WE WERE IN PRIVATE LIFE AGAIN
2582-155972-0030 AND IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD LEFT THE NAVY IN ORDER TO STUDY DENTISTRY AND ADDED A DELICIOUS TOUCH THAT WHILE THUS PREPARING HIMSELF TO BE A DENTIST HE WAS EARNING THE NECESSARY MONEY TO GO ON WITH HIS STUDIES
2582-155972-0031 BY PRACTICING THE PROFESSION OF A PRIZE FIGHTER BEING A GOOD MAN IN THE RING THERE ARE VARIOUS BRONZES IN THE HOUSE SAINT GAUDENS'S PURITAN A TOKEN FROM MY STAFF OFFICERS WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR
2582-155972-0032 PROCTOR'S COUGAR THE GIFT OF THE TENNIS CABINET WHO ALSO GAVE US A BEAUTIFUL SILVER BOWL WHICH IS ALWAYS LOVINGLY PRONOUNCED TO RHYME WITH OWL BECAUSE THAT WAS THE PRONUNCIATION USED AT THE TIME OF THE GIVING BY THE VALUED FRIEND WHO ACTED AS SPOKESMAN FOR HIS FELLOW MEMBERS
2582-155972-0033 AND WHO WAS HIMSELF THE ONLY NON AMERICAN MEMBER OF THE SAID CABINET THERE IS A HORSEMAN BY MACMONNIES AND A BIG BRONZE VASE BY KEMYS AN ADAPTATION OR DEVELOPMENT OF THE POTTERY VASES OF THE SOUTHWESTERN INDIANS
2582-155972-0034 AND A WONDERFUL PSALTER FROM THE EMPEROR MENELIK TO A PRICELESS ANCIENT SAMURAI SWORD COMING FROM JAPAN IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE PEACE OF PORTSMOUTH
2582-155972-0035 AND A BEAUTIFULLY INLAID MINIATURE SUIT OF JAPANESE ARMOR GIVEN ME BY A FAVORITE HERO OF MINE ADMIRAL TOGO WHEN HE VISITED SAGAMORE HILL THERE ARE THINGS FROM EUROPEAN FRIENDS
2582-155972-0036 A HUGE VERY HANDSOME EDITION OF THE NIBELUNGENLIED A STRIKING MINIATURE OF JOHN HAMPDEN FROM WINDSOR CASTLE
2582-155972-0037 A SIOUX BUFFALO ROBE WITH ON IT PAINTED BY SOME LONG DEAD SIOUX ARTIST THE PICTURE STORY OF CUSTER'S FIGHT A BRONZE PORTRAIT PLAQUE OF JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS
2582-155972-0038 WHERE LIGHT AND SHADOW MEET THE PORCELAIN TOWERS AND THE SEATS OF THE MIGHTY HE IS DEAD NOW AND HE HAD SCANT RECOGNITION WHILE HE LIVED YET SURELY HE WAS A GREAT IMAGINATIVE ARTIST A WONDERFUL COLORIST
2582-155972-0039 AND SKETCHES OF THE WHITE HOUSE BY SARGENT AND BY HOPKINSON SMITH THE BOOKS ARE EVERYWHERE THERE ARE AS MANY IN THE NORTH ROOM AND IN THE PARLOR IS DRAWING ROOM A MORE APPROPRIATE NAME THAN PARLOR AS IN THE LIBRARY
2582-155972-0040 THE GUN ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE WHICH INCIDENTALLY HAS THE LOVELIEST VIEW OF ALL CONTAINS MORE BOOKS THAN ANY OF THE OTHER ROOMS AND THEY ARE PARTICULARLY DELIGHTFUL BOOKS TO BROWSE AMONG JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT MUCH RELEVANCE TO ONE ANOTHER
2582-155972-0041 THIS BEING ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY ARE RELEGATED TO THEIR PRESENT ABODE BUT THE BOOKS HAVE OVERFLOWED INTO ALL THE OTHER ROOMS TOO I COULD NOT NAME ANY PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THE BOOKS HAVE BEEN GATHERED BOOKS ARE ALMOST AS INDIVIDUAL AS FRIENDS
2582-155972-0042 THERE IS NO EARTHLY USE IN LAYING DOWN GENERAL LAWS ABOUT THEM SOME MEET THE NEEDS OF ONE PERSON AND SOME OF ANOTHER AND EACH PERSON SHOULD BEWARE OF THE BOOKLOVER'S BESETTING SIN
2582-155972-0043 OF WHAT MISTER EDGAR ALLAN POE CALLS THE MAD PRIDE OF INTELLECTUALITY TAKING THE SHAPE OF ARROGANT PITY FOR THE MAN WHO DOES NOT LIKE THE SAME KIND OF BOOKS OF COURSE THERE ARE BOOKS WHICH A MAN OR WOMAN USES AS INSTRUMENTS OF A PROFESSION
2582-155972-0044 LAW BOOKS MEDICAL BOOKS COOKERY BOOKS AND THE LIKE I AM NOT SPEAKING OF THESE FOR THEY ARE NOT PROPERLY BOOKS AT ALL THEY COME IN THE CATEGORY OF TIME TABLES TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES AND OTHER USEFUL AGENCIES OF CIVILIZED LIFE
2582-155972-0045 I AM SPEAKING OF BOOKS THAT ARE MEANT TO BE READ PERSONALLY GRANTED THAT THESE BOOKS ARE DECENT AND HEALTHY THE ONE TEST TO WHICH I DEMAND THAT THEY ALL SUBMIT IS THAT OF BEING INTERESTING IF THE BOOK IS NOT INTERESTING TO THE READER
2582-155972-0046 OF COURSE ANY READER OUGHT TO CULTIVATE HIS OR HER TASTE SO THAT GOOD BOOKS WILL APPEAL TO IT AND THAT TRASH WON'T BUT AFTER THIS POINT HAS ONCE BEEN REACHED THE NEEDS OF EACH READER MUST BE MET IN A FASHION THAT WILL APPEAL TO THOSE NEEDS
2582-155972-0047 PERSONALLY THE BOOKS BY WHICH I HAVE PROFITED INFINITELY MORE THAN BY ANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN THOSE IN WHICH PROFIT WAS A BY PRODUCT OF THE PLEASURE THAT IS I READ THEM BECAUSE I ENJOYED THEM BECAUSE I LIKED READING THEM
2582-155972-0048 AND THE PROFIT CAME IN AS PART OF THE ENJOYMENT OF COURSE EACH INDIVIDUAL IS APT TO HAVE SOME SPECIAL TASTES IN WHICH HE CANNOT EXPECT THAT ANY BUT A FEW FRIENDS WILL SHARE NOW I AM VERY PROUD OF MY BIG GAME LIBRARY
2582-155972-0049 I SUPPOSE THERE MUST BE MANY BIG GAME LIBRARIES IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND POSSIBLY IN ENGLAND MORE EXTENSIVE THAN MINE BUT I HAVE NOT HAPPENED TO COME ACROSS ANY SUCH LIBRARY IN THIS COUNTRY SOME OF THE ORIGINALS GO BACK TO THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
2582-155972-0050 AND THERE ARE COPIES OR REPRODUCTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE MOST FAMOUS HUNTING BOOKS OF THE MIDDLE AGES SUCH AS THE DUKE OF YORK'S TRANSLATION OF GASTON PHOEBUS AND THE QUEER BOOK OF THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN
2582-155972-0051 IT IS ONLY VERY OCCASIONALLY THAT I MEET ANY ONE WHO CARES FOR ANY OF THESE BOOKS ON THE OTHER HAND I EXPECT TO FIND MANY FRIENDS WHO WILL TURN NATURALLY TO SOME OF THE OLD OR THE NEW BOOKS OF POETRY OR ROMANCE
2582-155972-0052 OR HISTORY TO WHICH WE OF THE HOUSEHOLD HABITUALLY TURN LET ME ADD THAT OURS IS IN NO SENSE A COLLECTOR'S LIBRARY EACH BOOK WAS PROCURED BECAUSE SOME ONE OF THE FAMILY WISHED TO READ IT
2582-155972-0053 IF HE CANNOT ALSO ENJOY THE HEBREW PROPHETS AND THE GREEK DRAMATISTS HE SHOULD BE SORRY HE OUGHT TO READ INTERESTING BOOKS ON HISTORY AND GOVERNMENT AND BOOKS OF SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY
2582-155972-0054 AND REALLY GOOD BOOKS ON THESE SUBJECTS ARE AS ENTHRALLING AS ANY FICTION EVER WRITTEN IN PROSE OR VERSE GIBBON AND MACAULAY HERODOTUS
2582-155972-0055 WHY THERE ARE SCORES AND SCORES OF SOLID HISTORIES THE BEST IN THE WORLD WHICH ARE AS ABSORBING AS THE BEST OF ALL THE NOVELS AND OF AS PERMANENT VALUE THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF DARWIN AND HUXLEY AND CARLYLE AND EMERSON AND PARTS OF KANT
2582-155972-0056 I DO NOT FOR A MINUTE MEAN THAT THE STATESMAN OUGHT NOT TO READ A GREAT MANY DIFFERENT BOOKS OF THIS CHARACTER JUST AS EVERY ONE ELSE SHOULD READ THEM BUT IN THE FINAL EVENT THE STATESMAN AND THE PUBLICIST AND THE REFORMER AND THE AGITATOR FOR NEW THINGS
2582-155972-0057 AND THE UPHOLDER OF WHAT IS GOOD IN OLD THINGS ALL NEED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO KNOW HUMAN NATURE TO KNOW THE NEEDS OF THE HUMAN SOUL AND THEY WILL FIND THIS NATURE AND THESE NEEDS SET FORTH AS NOWHERE ELSE BY THE GREAT IMAGINATIVE WRITERS
2582-155972-0058 WHETHER OF PROSE OR OF POETRY THE ROOM FOR CHOICE IS SO LIMITLESS THAT TO MY MIND IT SEEMS ABSURD TO TRY TO MAKE CATALOGUES WHICH SHALL BE SUPPOSED TO APPEAL TO ALL THE BEST THINKERS
2582-155972-0059 THIS IS WHY I HAVE NO SYMPATHY WHATEVER WITH WRITING LISTS OF THE ONE HUNDRED BEST BOOKS OR THE FIVE FOOT LIBRARY IT IS ALL RIGHT FOR A MAN TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY COMPOSING A LIST OF A HUNDRED VERY GOOD BOOKS
2582-155972-0060 AND IF HE IS TO GO OFF FOR A YEAR OR SO WHERE HE CANNOT GET MANY BOOKS IT IS AN EXCELLENT THING TO CHOOSE A FIVE FOOT LIBRARY OF PARTICULAR BOOKS WHICH IN THAT PARTICULAR YEAR AND ON THAT PARTICULAR TRIP HE WOULD LIKE TO READ
2582-155972-0061 ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS EXTENDING OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS MILTON IS BEST FOR ONE MOOD AND POPE FOR ANOTHER BECAUSE A MAN LIKES WHITMAN OR BROWNING OR LOWELL HE SHOULD NOT FEEL HIMSELF DEBARRED FROM TENNYSON OR KIPLING OR KORNER OR HEINE OR
2582-155972-0062 TOLSTOY'S NOVELS ARE GOOD AT ONE TIME
2582-155972-0063 EACH ONE OF WHICH IF REALLY READ REALLY ASSIMILATED BY THE PERSON TO WHOM IT HAPPENS TO APPEAL WILL ENABLE THAT PERSON QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY TO FURNISH HIMSELF WITH MUCH AMMUNITION WHICH HE WILL FIND OF USE IN THE BATTLE OF LIFE
2582-155972-0064 A BOOK MUST BE INTERESTING TO THE PARTICULAR READER AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME
2582-155972-0065 AND SOME OF THEM ARE SEALED TO SOME MEN AND SOME ARE SEALED TO OTHERS AND SOME STIR THE SOUL AT SOME GIVEN POINT OF A MAN'S LIFE AND YET CONVEY NO MESSAGE AT OTHER TIMES
2582-155972-0066 THE READER THE BOOKLOVER MUST MEET HIS OWN NEEDS WITHOUT PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO WHAT HIS NEIGHBORS SAY THOSE NEEDS SHOULD BE HE MUST NOT HYPOCRITICALLY PRETEND TO LIKE WHAT HE DOES NOT LIKE
2582-155972-0067 YET AT THE SAME TIME HE MUST AVOID THAT MOST UNPLEASANT OF ALL THE INDICATIONS OF PUFFED UP VANITY WHICH CONSISTS IN TREATING MERE INDIVIDUAL AND PERHAPS UNFORTUNATE IDIOSYNCRASY AS A MATTER OF PRIDE I HAPPEN TO BE DEVOTED TO MACBETH
2582-155972-0068 WHEREAS I VERY SELDOM READ HAMLET THOUGH I LIKE PARTS OF IT NOW I AM HUMBLY AND SINCERELY CONSCIOUS THAT THIS IS A DEMERIT IN ME AND NOT IN HAMLET AND YET IT WOULD NOT DO ME ANY GOOD TO PRETEND THAT I LIKE HAMLET AS MUCH AS MACBETH WHEN AS A MATTER OF FACT I DON'T
2582-155972-0069 AND THE ROLAND SONG THROUGH CHEVY CHASE AND PATRICK SPENS AND TWA CORBIES TO SCOTT'S POEMS AND LONGFELLOW'S
2582-155972-0070 OR MOLIERE IN ORDER THAT I MAY NOT FEEL AFTER FINISHING THEM A SENSE OF VIRTUOUS PRIDE IN HAVING ACHIEVED A TASK
2582-155972-0071 NOW I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO DENY THAT EVEN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL OLD ENGLISH BALLAD SHOULD BE PUT ON A PAR WITH ANY ONE OF SCORES OF DRAMATIC WORKS BY AUTHORS WHOM I HAVE NOT MENTIONED
2582-155972-0072 I KNOW THAT EACH OF THESE DRAMATISTS HAS WRITTEN WHAT IS OF MORE WORTH THAN THE BALLAD ONLY I ENJOY THE BALLAD AND I DON'T ENJOY THE DRAMA AND THEREFORE THE BALLAD IS BETTER FOR ME
2582-155972-0073 AND THIS FACT IS NOT ALTERED BY THE OTHER FACT THAT MY OWN SHORTCOMINGS ARE TO BLAME IN THE MATTER I STILL READ A NUMBER OF SCOTT'S NOVELS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEREAS IF I FINISH ANYTHING BY MISS AUSTEN
2582-155972-0074 I HAVE A FEELING THAT DUTY PERFORMED IS A RAINBOW TO THE SOUL BUT OTHER BOOKLOVERS WHO ARE VERY CLOSE KIN TO ME AND WHOSE TASTE I KNOW TO BE BETTER THAN MINE READ MISS AUSTEN ALL THE TIME AND MOREOVER
2582-155972-0075 THEY ARE VERY KIND AND NEVER PITY ME IN TOO OFFENSIVE A MANNER FOR NOT READING HER MYSELF ASIDE FROM THE MASTERS OF LITERATURE THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF BOOKS WHICH ONE PERSON WILL FIND DELIGHTFUL
2582-155972-0076 AND WHICH HE CERTAINLY OUGHT NOT TO SURRENDER JUST BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE IS ABLE TO FIND AS MUCH IN THE BELOVED VOLUME THERE IS ON OUR BOOK SHELVES A LITTLE PRE VICTORIAN NOVEL OR TALE CALLED THE SEMI ATTACHED COUPLE IT IS TOLD WITH MUCH HUMOR
