8087-118726-0000 FORMERLY CALLED ISLES OF THE SAINTS HE WAS LOOKING ACROSS THE ATLANTIC FOR A GLIMPSE OF HY BRASAIL
8087-118726-0001 AND THE OLDER THEY WERE THE OFTENER IT HAD BEEN SEEN BY THEM AND THE LARGER IT LOOKED BUT KIRWAN HAD NEVER SEEN IT AND WHENEVER HE CAME TO THE TOP OF THE HIGHEST CLIFF
8087-118726-0002 HE CLIMBED THE GREAT MASS OF GRANITE CALLED THE GREGORY AND PEERED OUT INTO THE WEST ESPECIALLY AT SUNSET IN HOPES THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST CATCH A GLIMPSE SOME HAPPY EVENING
8087-118726-0003 OF THE CLIFFS AND MEADOWS OF HY BRASAIL BUT AS YET HE HAD NEVER
8087-118726-0004 ALL THIS WAS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO HE NATURALLY WENT UP TO THE GREGORY AT THIS HOUR BECAUSE IT WAS THEN THAT HE MET THE OTHER BOYS
8087-118726-0005 AND PAID THEM A SIXPENCE FOR EVERY DOZEN BIRDS THAT HE MIGHT SELL THE FEATHERS THE BOYS HAD A ROPE THREE HUNDRED FEET LONG WHICH COULD REACH THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF ONE OF THEM TIED THIS ROPE AROUND HIS WAIST
8087-118726-0006 AND THEN HELD IT FAST WITH BOTH HANDS THE ROPE BEING HELD ABOVE BY FOUR OR FIVE STRONG BOYS WHO LOWERED THE CRAGMAN OR CLIFTER AS HE WAS CALLED OVER THE PRECIPICE
8087-118726-0007 KIRWAN WAS THUS LOWERED TO THE ROCKS NEAR THE SEA WHERE THE PUFFINS BRED AND LOOSENING THE ROPE HE PREPARED TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN CATCHING THEM HE HAD A POLE WITH A SNARE ON THE END
8087-118726-0008 BESIDES QUANTITIES OF THEIR LARGE EGGS WHICH WERE FOUND IN DEEP CLEFTS IN THE ROCK AND THESE HE CARRIED WITH HIM WHEN HIS FRIENDS CAME IN THE MORNING TO HAUL HIM UP IT WAS A GOOD SCHOOL OF COURAGE FOR SOMETIMES BOYS MISSED THEIR FOOTING
8087-118726-0009 AND WERE DASHED TO PIECES AT OTHER TIMES HE FISHED IN HIS FATHER'S BOAT OR DROVE CALVES FOR SALE ON THE MAINLAND OR CURED SALT AFTER HIGH TIDE IN THE CAVERNS OR COLLECTED KELP FOR THE FARMERS
8087-118726-0010 LONG HE TOILED WITH HIS OARS TOWARD THE WEST WHERE HE FANCIED THE REST OF THE FLEET TO BE AND SOMETIMES HE SPREAD HIS LITTLE SPRIT SAIL STEERING WITH AN OAR A THING WHICH WAS
8087-118726-0011 IN A HEAVY SEA ALMOST AS HARD AS ROWING AT LAST THE FOG LIFTED AND HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE UPON THE OCEAN HE HAD LOST HIS BEARINGS AND COULD NOT TELL THE POINTS OF THE COMPASS PRESENTLY
8087-118726-0012 OUT OF A HEAVY BANK OF FOG WHICH ROSE AGAINST THE HORIZON HE SAW WHAT SEEMED LAND IT GAVE HIM NEW STRENGTH AND HE WORKED HARD TO REACH IT BUT IT WAS LONG SINCE HE HAD EATEN HIS HEAD WAS DIZZY
8087-118726-0013 AND HE LAY DOWN ON THE THWART OF THE BOAT RATHER HEEDLESS OF WHAT MIGHT COME GROWING WEAKER AND WEAKER HE DID NOT CLEARLY KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING SUDDENLY HE STARTED UP FOR A VOICE HAILED HIM FROM ABOVE HIS HEAD
8087-118726-0014 HE SAW ABOVE HIM THE HIGH STERN OF A SMALL VESSEL AND WITH THE AID OF A SAILOR HE WAS HELPED ON BOARD HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE DECK OF A SLOOP OF ABOUT SEVENTY TONS JOHN NISBET MASTER
8087-118726-0015 WITH A CREW OF SEVEN MEN THEY HAD SAILED FROM KILLEBEGS COUNTY DONEGAL IN IRELAND FOR THE COAST OF FRANCE LADEN WITH BUTTER TALLOW AND HIDES AND WERE NOW RETURNING FROM FRANCE
8087-118726-0016 WITH FRENCH WINES AND WERE BEFOGGED AS KIRWAN HAD BEEN THE BOY WAS AT ONCE TAKEN ON BOARD AND RATED AS A SEAMAN AND THE LATER ADVENTURES OF THE TRIP ARE HERE GIVEN AS HE REPORTED THEM ON HIS RETURN
8087-118726-0017 THESE BEING JAMES ROSS THE CARPENTER AND TWO SAILORS WITH THE BOY KIRWAN THEY TOOK SWORDS AND PISTOLS LANDING AT THE EDGE OF A LITTLE WOOD THEY WALKED FOR A MILE WITHIN A PLEASANT VALLEY WHERE CATTLE
8087-118726-0018 BUT WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THE TOP AND LOOKED AROUND THEY COULD SEE NO INHABITANTS NOR ANY HOUSE ON WHICH THEY RETURNED TO THE SLOOP AND TOLD THEIR TALE AFTER THIS THE WHOLE SHIP'S COMPANY WENT ASHORE EXCEPT ONE LEFT IN CHARGE
8087-118726-0019 WHEN SUDDENLY THEY HEARD LOUD NOISES FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CASTLE AND THEN ALL OVER THE ISLAND WHICH FRIGHTENED THEM SO THAT THEY WENT ON BOARD THE SLOOP AND STAYED ALL NIGHT THE NEXT MORNING THEY SAW A DIGNIFIED ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
8087-118726-0020 WITH TEN UNARMED FOLLOWERS COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE SHORE HAILING THE SLOOP THE OLDER GENTLEMAN SPEAKING GAELIC ASKED WHO AND WHENCE THEY WERE AND BEING TOLD INVITED THEM ASHORE AS HIS GUESTS
8087-118726-0021 THEY WENT ON SHORE WELL ARMED AND HE EMBRACED THEM ONE BY ONE TELLING THEM THAT THEY WERE THE HAPPIEST SIGHT THAT ISLAND HAD SEEN FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THAT IT WAS CALLED HY BRASAIL
8087-118726-0022 AND THAT FOR THE SAME REASON HE AND HIS FRIENDS WERE RENDERED UNABLE TO ANSWER THE SAILORS EVEN WHEN THEY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND THAT THE ENCHANTMENT MUST REMAIN UNTIL A FIRE WAS KINDLED ON THE ISLAND BY GOOD CHRISTIANS
8087-118726-0023 THIS HAD BEEN DONE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE TERRIBLE NOISES WHICH THEY HAD HEARD WERE FROM THE POWERS OF DARKNESS WHICH HAD NOW LEFT THE ISLAND FOREVER AND INDEED WHEN THE SAILORS WERE LED TO THE CASTLE
8087-118726-0024 THEY SAW THAT THE CHIEF TOWER HAD JUST BEEN DEMOLISHED BY THE POWERS OF DARKNESS AS THEY RETREATED BUT THERE WERE SITTING WITHIN THE HALLS MEN AND WOMEN OF DIGNIFIED APPEARANCE
8087-118726-0025 WHO THANKED THEM FOR THE GOOD SERVICE THEY HAD DONE THEN THEY WERE TAKEN OVER THE ISLAND WHICH PROVED TO BE SOME SIXTY MILES LONG AND THIRTY WIDE ABOUNDING WITH HORSES CATTLE SHEEP DEER RABBITS AND BIRDS
8087-118726-0026 SOMEWHAT RUSTY YET OF PURE GOLD AND THERE WAS AT ONCE AN EAGER DESIRE ON THE PART OF CERTAIN OF THE TOWNSMEN TO GO WITH THEM WITHIN A WEEK AN EXPEDITION WAS FITTED OUT CONTAINING SEVERAL GODLY MINISTERS
8087-118726-0027 WHO WISHED TO VISIT AND DISCOVER THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND BUT THROUGH SOME MISHAP OF THE SEAS THIS EXPEDITION WAS NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN
8087-118726-0028 THERE WERE NOT WANTING THOSE WHO HELD THAT THE ANCIENT GOLD PIECES MIGHT HAVE BEEN GAINED BY PIRACY SUCH AS WAS BEGINNING TO BE KNOWN UPON THE SPANISH MAIN AND AS FOR THE BOY KIRWAN
8087-118726-0029 SOME OF HIS PLAYMATES DID NOT HESITATE TO EXPRESS THE OPINION THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN AS THEY PHRASED IT THE GREATEST LIAR THAT EVER SPOKE WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THE ISLAND OF BRAZIL OR HY BRASAIL
8087-118726-0030 AS OFTEN SEEN FROM THE SHORE AND THAT IT APPEARED AS BRAZIL ROCK ON THE LONDON ADMIRALTY CHARTS UNTIL AFTER EIGHTEEN FIFTY IF MANY PEOPLE TRIED TO FIND IT AND FAILED
