3114-170976-0000 AND HOW DOES HE LIVE IN HAPPINESS OR IN MISERY YES HE SAID HE IS THE ONLY ONE REMAINING THERE IS HOWEVER I SAID A PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH REMAINS UNANSWERED WHAT QUESTION
3114-170976-0001 I DO NOT THINK THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY DETERMINED THE NATURE AND NUMBER OF THE APPETITES AND UNTIL THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THE ENQUIRY WILL ALWAYS BE CONFUSED WELL HE SAID IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO SUPPLY THE OMISSION
3114-170976-0002 VERY TRUE I SAID AND OBSERVE THE POINT WHICH I WANT TO UNDERSTAND CERTAIN OF THE UNNECESSARY PLEASURES AND APPETITES I CONCEIVE TO BE UNLAWFUL EVERY ONE APPEARS TO HAVE THEM BUT IN SOME PERSONS
3114-170976-0003 THEY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE LAWS AND BY REASON AND THE BETTER DESIRES PREVAIL OVER THEM EITHER THEY ARE WHOLLY BANISHED OR THEY BECOME FEW AND WEAK WHILE IN THE CASE OF OTHERS THEY ARE STRONGER AND THERE ARE MORE OF THEM WHICH APPETITES DO YOU MEAN
3114-170976-0004 I MEAN THOSE WHICH ARE AWAKE WHEN THE REASONING AND HUMAN AND RULING POWER IS ASLEEP THEN THE WILD BEAST WITHIN US GORGED WITH MEAT OR DRINK STARTS UP AND HAVING SHAKEN OFF SLEEP
3114-170976-0005 A MAN MAY NOT BE READY TO COMMIT MOST TRUE HE SAID BUT WHEN A MAN'S PULSE IS HEALTHY AND TEMPERATE AND WHEN BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP HE HAS AWAKENED HIS RATIONAL POWERS AND FED THEM ON NOBLE THOUGHTS AND ENQUIRIES
3114-170976-0006 WHEN AFTER PACIFYING THE TWO IRRATIONAL PRINCIPLES HE ROUSES UP THE THIRD WHICH IS REASON BEFORE HE TAKES HIS REST THEN AS YOU KNOW HE ATTAINS TRUTH MOST NEARLY AND IS LEAST LIKELY TO BE THE SPORT OF FANTASTIC AND LAWLESS VISIONS
3114-170976-0007 I QUITE AGREE IN SAYING THIS I HAVE BEEN RUNNING INTO A DIGRESSION BUT THE POINT WHICH I DESIRE TO NOTE IS THAT IN ALL OF US EVEN IN GOOD MEN THERE IS A LAWLESS WILD BEAST NATURE WHICH PEERS OUT IN SLEEP PRAY
3114-170976-0008 CONSIDER WHETHER I AM RIGHT AND YOU AGREE WITH ME YES I AGREE AND NOW REMEMBER THE CHARACTER WHICH WE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC MAN HE WAS SUPPOSED FROM HIS YOUTH UPWARDS TO HAVE BEEN TRAINED UNDER A MISERLY PARENT
3114-170976-0009 WHO ENCOURAGED THE SAVING APPETITES IN HIM BUT DISCOUNTENANCED THE UNNECESSARY WHICH AIM ONLY AT AMUSEMENT AND ORNAMENT TRUE AND THEN HE GOT INTO THE COMPANY OF A MORE REFINED LICENTIOUS SORT OF PEOPLE
3114-170976-0010 AND TAKING TO ALL THEIR WANTON WAYS RUSHED INTO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME FROM AN ABHORRENCE OF HIS FATHER'S MEANNESS AT LAST BEING A BETTER MAN THAN HIS CORRUPTORS HE WAS DRAWN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
3114-170976-0011 AND LED A LIFE NOT OF VULGAR AND SLAVISH PASSION BUT OF WHAT HE DEEMED MODERATE INDULGENCE IN VARIOUS PLEASURES AFTER THIS MANNER THE DEMOCRAT WAS GENERATED OUT OF THE OLIGARCH YES HE SAID THAT WAS OUR VIEW OF HIM AND IS SO STILL
3114-170976-0012 AND NOW I SAID
3114-170976-0013 AND YOU MUST CONCEIVE THIS MAN SUCH AS HE IS TO HAVE A SON WHO IS BROUGHT UP IN HIS FATHER'S PRINCIPLES I CAN IMAGINE HIM THEN YOU MUST FURTHER IMAGINE THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN TO THE SON WHICH HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TO THE FATHER
3114-170976-0014 HE IS DRAWN INTO A PERFECTLY LAWLESS LIFE WHICH BY HIS SEDUCERS IS TERMED PERFECT LIBERTY AND HIS FATHER AND FRIENDS TAKE PART WITH HIS MODERATE DESIRES AND THE OPPOSITE PARTY ASSIST THE OPPOSITE ONES
3114-170976-0015 AS SOON AS THESE DIRE MAGICIANS AND TYRANT MAKERS FIND THAT THEY ARE LOSING THEIR HOLD ON HIM THEY CONTRIVE TO IMPLANT IN HIM A MASTER PASSION TO BE LORD OVER HIS IDLE AND SPENDTHRIFT LUSTS A SORT OF MONSTROUS WINGED DRONE
3114-170976-0016 AND ALL THE PLEASURES OF A DISSOLUTE LIFE NOW LET LOOSE COME BUZZING AROUND HIM NOURISHING TO THE UTMOST THE STING OF DESIRE WHICH THEY IMPLANT IN HIS DRONE LIKE NATURE THEN AT LAST THIS LORD OF THE SOUL HAVING MADNESS FOR THE CAPTAIN OF HIS GUARD
3114-170976-0017 BREAKS OUT INTO A FRENZY AND IF HE FINDS IN HIMSELF ANY GOOD OPINIONS OR APPETITES IN PROCESS OF FORMATION AND THERE IS IN HIM ANY SENSE OF SHAME REMAINING TO THESE BETTER PRINCIPLES HE PUTS AN END
3114-170976-0018 AND BROUGHT IN MADNESS TO THE FULL YES HE SAID THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH THE TYRANNICAL MAN IS GENERATED AND IS NOT THIS THE REASON WHY OF OLD LOVE HAS BEEN CALLED A TYRANT I SHOULD NOT WONDER
3114-170976-0019 FURTHER I SAID HAS NOT A DRUNKEN MAN ALSO THE SPIRIT OF A TYRANT HE HAS AND YOU KNOW THAT A MAN WHO IS DERANGED AND NOT RIGHT IN HIS MIND WILL FANCY THAT HE IS ABLE TO RULE NOT ONLY OVER MEN
3114-170976-0020 BUT ALSO OVER THE GODS THAT HE WILL AND THE TYRANNICAL MAN IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD COMES INTO BEING WHEN EITHER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NATURE OR HABIT OR BOTH HE BECOMES DRUNKEN LUSTFUL
3114-170976-0021 PASSIONATE O MY FRIEND IS NOT THAT SO ASSUREDLY SUCH IS THE MAN AND SUCH IS HIS ORIGIN AND NEXT HOW DOES HE LIVE SUPPOSE AS PEOPLE FACETIOUSLY SAY YOU WERE TO TELL ME
3114-170976-0022 THAT IS CERTAIN YES AND EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT DESIRES GROW UP MANY AND FORMIDABLE AND THEIR DEMANDS ARE MANY THEY ARE INDEED HE SAID HIS REVENUES IF HE HAS ANY ARE SOON SPENT
3114-170976-0023 WHO IS IN A MANNER THE CAPTAIN OF THEM IS IN A FRENZY AND WOULD FAIN DISCOVER WHOM HE CAN DEFRAUD OR DESPOIL OF HIS PROPERTY IN ORDER THAT HE MAY GRATIFY THEM YES THAT IS SURE TO BE THE CASE HE MUST HAVE MONEY
3114-170976-0024 AND IF HE FAILS THEN HE WILL USE FORCE AND PLUNDER THEM YES PROBABLY AND IF THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN WHAT THEN MY FRIEND
3114-170976-0025 NAY HE SAID I SHOULD NOT FEEL AT ALL COMFORTABLE ABOUT HIS PARENTS BUT O HEAVENS ADEIMANTUS ON ACCOUNT OF SOME NEW FANGLED LOVE OF A HARLOT WHO IS ANYTHING BUT A NECESSARY CONNECTION CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD STRIKE THE MOTHER
3114-170976-0026 WHO IS HIS ANCIENT FRIEND AND NECESSARY TO HIS VERY EXISTENCE AND WOULD PLACE HER UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE OTHER WHEN SHE IS BROUGHT UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH HER OR THAT UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES HE WOULD DO THE SAME TO HIS WITHERED OLD FATHER
3114-170976-0027 FIRST AND MOST INDISPENSABLE OF FRIENDS FOR THE SAKE OF SOME NEWLY FOUND BLOOMING YOUTH WHO IS THE REVERSE OF INDISPENSABLE YES INDEED HE SAID I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD TRULY THEN I SAID
3114-170976-0028 A TYRANNICAL SON IS A BLESSING TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HE IS INDEED HE REPLIED
3114-170976-0029 THE OLD OPINIONS WHICH HE HAD WHEN A CHILD AND WHICH GAVE JUDGMENT ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL ARE OVERTHROWN BY THOSE OTHERS WHICH HAVE JUST BEEN EMANCIPATED AND ARE NOW THE BODY GUARD OF LOVE AND SHARE HIS EMPIRE THESE IN HIS DEMOCRATIC DAYS
3114-170976-0030 WHEN HE WAS STILL SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND TO HIS FATHER WERE ONLY LET LOOSE IN THE DREAMS OF SLEEP BUT NOW THAT HE IS UNDER THE DOMINION OF LOVE
3114-170976-0031 HE WILL COMMIT THE FOULEST MURDER OR EAT FORBIDDEN FOOD OR BE GUILTY OF ANY OTHER HORRID ACT LOVE IS HIS TYRANT AND LIVES LORDLY IN HIM AND LAWLESSLY AND BEING HIMSELF A KING LEADS HIM ON
3114-170976-0032 AS A TYRANT LEADS A STATE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY RECKLESS DEED BY WHICH HE CAN MAINTAIN HIMSELF AND THE RABBLE OF HIS ASSOCIATES
3114-170976-0033 OR THOSE WHOM HE HIMSELF HAS ALLOWED TO BREAK LOOSE WITHIN HIM BY REASON OF A SIMILAR EVIL NATURE IN HIMSELF HAVE WE NOT HERE A PICTURE OF HIS WAY OF LIFE YES INDEED HE SAID AND IF THERE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THEM IN THE STATE
3114-170976-0034 AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ARE WELL DISPOSED THEY GO AWAY AND BECOME THE BODY GUARD OR MERCENARY SOLDIERS OF SOME OTHER TYRANT WHO MAY PROBABLY WANT THEM FOR A WAR AND IF THERE IS NO WAR THEY STAY AT HOME AND DO MANY LITTLE PIECES OF MISCHIEF IN THE CITY
3114-170976-0035 WHAT SORT OF MISCHIEF FOR EXAMPLE
3114-170976-0036 EVEN IF THE PERPETRATORS OF THEM ARE FEW IN NUMBER YES I SAID BUT SMALL AND GREAT ARE COMPARATIVE TERMS AND ALL THESE THINGS IN THE MISERY AND EVIL WHICH THEY INFLICT UPON A STATE DO NOT COME WITHIN A THOUSAND MILES OF THE TYRANT
3114-170976-0037 ASSISTED BY THE INFATUATION OF THE PEOPLE THEY CHOOSE FROM AMONG THEMSELVES THE ONE WHO HAS MOST OF THE TYRANT IN HIS OWN SOUL AND HIM THEY CREATE THEIR TYRANT YES HE SAID AND HE WILL BE THE MOST FIT TO BE A TYRANT IF THE PEOPLE YIELD
3114-170976-0038 WELL AND GOOD BUT IF THEY RESIST HIM AS HE BEGAN BY BEATING HIS OWN FATHER AND MOTHER SO NOW IF HE HAS THE POWER HE BEATS THEM AND WILL KEEP HIS DEAR OLD FATHERLAND OR MOTHERLAND AS THE CRETANS SAY IN SUBJECTION TO HIS YOUNG RETAINERS
3114-170976-0039 THIS IS THE END OF HIS PASSIONS AND DESIRES EXACTLY WHEN SUCH MEN ARE ONLY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND BEFORE THEY GET POWER THIS IS THEIR CHARACTER THEY ASSOCIATE ENTIRELY WITH THEIR OWN FLATTERERS OR READY TOOLS
3114-170976-0040 OR IF THEY WANT ANYTHING FROM ANYBODY THEY IN THEIR TURN ARE EQUALLY READY TO BOW DOWN BEFORE THEM
3114-170976-0041 NO QUESTION ALSO THEY ARE UTTERLY UNJUST IF WE WERE RIGHT IN OUR NOTION OF JUSTICE YES HE SAID AND WE WERE PERFECTLY RIGHT LET US THEN SUM UP IN A WORD I SAID THE CHARACTER OF THE WORST MAN
3114-170976-0042 HE IS THE WAKING REALITY OF WHAT WE DREAMED MOST TRUE AND THIS IS HE WHO BEING BY NATURE MOST OF A TYRANT BEARS RULE AND THE LONGER HE LIVES THE MORE OF A TYRANT HE BECOMES THAT IS CERTAIN SAID GLAUCON TAKING HIS TURN TO ANSWER
3114-170976-0043 BE ALSO THE MOST MISERABLE AND HE WHO HAS TYRANNIZED LONGEST AND MOST MOST CONTINUALLY AND TRULY MISERABLE ALTHOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE THE OPINION OF MEN IN GENERAL YES HE SAID INEVITABLY AND MUST NOT THE TYRANNICAL MAN
3114-170976-0044 BE LIKE THE TYRANNICAL STATE AND THE DEMOCRATICAL MAN LIKE THE DEMOCRATICAL STATE AND THE SAME OF THE OTHERS CERTAINLY AND AS STATE IS TO STATE IN VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS SO IS MAN IN RELATION TO MAN TO BE SURE
3114-170976-0045 THEN COMPARING OUR ORIGINAL CITY WHICH WAS UNDER A KING AND THE CITY WHICH IS UNDER A TYRANT HOW DO THEY STAND AS TO VIRTUE THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE EXTREMES HE SAID FOR ONE IS THE VERY BEST AND THE OTHER IS THE VERY WORST
3114-170976-0046 THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE I SAID AS TO WHICH IS WHICH AND THEREFORE I WILL AT ONCE ENQUIRE WHETHER YOU WOULD ARRIVE AT A SIMILAR DECISION ABOUT THEIR RELATIVE HAPPINESS AND MISERY
3114-170976-0047 HE MUST NOT BE LIKE A CHILD WHO LOOKS AT THE OUTSIDE AND IS DAZZLED AT THE POMPOUS ASPECT WHICH THE TYRANNICAL NATURE ASSUMES TO THE BEHOLDER BUT LET HIM BE ONE WHO HAS A CLEAR INSIGHT MAY I SUPPOSE THAT THE JUDGMENT IS GIVEN IN THE HEARING OF US ALL
3114-170976-0048 AND BEEN PRESENT AT HIS DALLY LIFE AND KNOWN HIM IN HIS FAMILY RELATIONS WHERE HE MAY BE SEEN STRIPPED OF HIS TRAGEDY ATTIRE AND AGAIN IN THE HOUR OF PUBLIC DANGER HE SHALL TELL US ABOUT THE HAPPINESS AND MISERY OF THE TYRANT WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER MEN
3114-170976-0049 THAT AGAIN HE SAID IS A VERY FAIR PROPOSAL
3114-170976-0050 WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE ASKED BEGINNING WITH THE STATE I REPLIED WOULD YOU SAY THAT A CITY WHICH IS GOVERNED BY A TYRANT IS FREE OR ENSLAVED NO CITY HE SAID CAN BE MORE COMPLETELY ENSLAVED AND YET AS YOU SEE
3114-170976-0051 THERE ARE FREEMEN AS WELL AS MASTERS IN SUCH A STATE YES HE SAID I SEE THAT THERE ARE A FEW
3114-170976-0052 ARE MISERABLY DEGRADED AND ENSLAVED THEN IF THE MAN IS LIKE THE STATE I SAID MUST NOT THE SAME RULE PREVAIL HIS SOUL IS FULL OF MEANNESS AND VULGARITY THE BEST ELEMENTS IN HIM ARE ENSLAVED AND THERE IS A SMALL RULING PART WHICH IS ALSO THE WORST AND MADDEST
3114-170976-0053 INEVITABLY AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE SOUL OF SUCH AN ONE IS THE SOUL OF A FREEMAN OR OF A SLAVE HE HAS THE SOUL OF A SLAVE IN MY OPINION
3114-170976-0054 AND THE STATE WHICH IS ENSLAVED UNDER A TYRANT IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF ACTING VOLUNTARILY UTTERLY INCAPABLE
3114-170976-0055 IS LEAST CAPABLE OF DOING WHAT SHE DESIRES THERE IS A GADFLY WHICH GOADS HER AND SHE IS FULL OF TROUBLE AND REMORSE CERTAINLY AND IS THE CITY WHICH IS UNDER A TYRANT RICH OR POOR
3114-170976-0056 MUST BE ALWAYS POOR AND INSATIABLE TRUE AND MUST NOT SUCH A STATE AND SUCH A MAN BE ALWAYS FULL OF FEAR YES INDEED IS THERE ANY STATE IN WHICH YOU WILL FIND MORE OF LAMENTATION AND SORROW AND GROANING AND PAIN
3114-170976-0057 CERTAINLY NOT AND IS THERE ANY MAN IN WHOM YOU WILL FIND MORE OF THIS SORT OF MISERY THAN IN THE TYRANNICAL MAN WHO IS IN A FURY OF PASSIONS AND DESIRES IMPOSSIBLE REFLECTING UPON THESE AND SIMILAR EVILS
3114-170976-0058 YOU HELD THE TYRANNICAL STATE TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE OF STATES AND I WAS RIGHT HE SAID CERTAINLY I SAID AND WHEN YOU SEE THE SAME EVILS IN THE TYRANNICAL MAN WHAT DO YOU SAY OF HIM
3114-170976-0059 I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS AS YET REACHED THE UTMOST EXTREME OF MISERY THEN WHO IS MORE MISERABLE
3114-170976-0060 YES I REPLIED BUT IN THIS HIGH ARGUMENT YOU SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE CERTAIN AND SHOULD NOT CONJECTURE ONLY FOR OF ALL QUESTIONS THIS RESPECTING GOOD AND EVIL IS THE GREATEST VERY TRUE
