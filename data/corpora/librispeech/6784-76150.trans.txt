6784-76150-0000 NOW AS HE WAS ABOUT TO QUIT ME THE CLOUDS WERE CLEARING AWAY AND AN OCCASIONAL STROKE OF LIGHTNING CAME DOWN ONE OF THESE HOWEVER HIT THE GROUND SUCH A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY THAT BOTH OF US COULD SMELL THE SMOKE
6784-76150-0001 MY MIND WAS MORE ALIVE THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE NOW WHAT CAUSED THAT MAKA THE LIGHTNING I MEAN WE HAVE IT NEARLY EVERY DAY YET I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT TO QUESTION IT BEFORE
6784-76150-0002 IT IS NO MYSTERY MY LAD QUOTH MAKA DODGING INTO HIS CHARIOT SO THAT HE WAS NOT WET
6784-76150-0003 WHERE THE AIR IS SO LIGHT THAT A MAN CAN SCARCE GET ENOUGH TO FILL HIS LUNGS
6784-76150-0004 THE SPACE ABOUT THE AIR IS FULL OF IT HE STARTED HIS ENGINE THEN LEANED OUT INTO THE RAIN AND SAID SOFTLY HOLD FAST TO WHAT THY FATHER HAS TAUGHT THEE STROKOR
6784-76150-0005 HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WOMEN TIS A MAN'S JOB AHEAD OF THEE AND THE FUTURE OF THE EMPIRE IS IN THY HANDS AND AS HE CLATTERED OFF FILL NOT THY HEAD WITH WONDERINGS ABOUT THE LIGHTNING
6784-76150-0006 AND IMMEDIATELY TURNED MY THOUGHTS TO MY NEW AMBITION AND YET
6784-76150-0007 AND SO IT DOES TO THIS VERY DAY
6784-76150-0008 WHETHER I WILL OR NO I SLEPT NOT AT ALL THAT NIGHT BUT SAT FOOTNOTE IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CUSTOM AMONG THE SOLDIERS NEVER TO LIE DOWN BUT TO TAKE THEIR SLEEP SITTING OR STANDING
6784-76150-0009 NO DOUBT THIS ALSO EXPLAINS THEIR STUNTED LEGS
6784-76150-0010 TILL THE DAWN CAME THINKING OUT A PLAN OF ACTION BY THAT TIME I WAS FAIR CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS NAUGHT TO BE GAINED BY WAITING WAITING MAKES ME IMPATIENT AS WELL
6784-76150-0011 I DETERMINED TO ACT AT ONCE AND SINCE ONE DAY IS QUITE AS GOOD AS THE NEXT I DECIDED THAT THIS DAY WAS TO SEE THE THING BEGUN I CAME BEFORE THE EMPEROR AT NOON AND RECEIVED MY DECORATIONS
6784-76150-0012 WITHIN THE HOUR I HAD MADE MYSELF KNOWN TO THE FOUR AND NINETY MEN WHO WERE TO BE MY COMMAND A PICKED COMPANY ALL OF A HEIGHT AND WEIGHT WITH BODIES THAT LACKED LITTLE OF MY OWN PERFECTION
6784-76150-0013 NEVER WAS THERE A FINER GUARD ABOUT THE PALACE MY FIRST CARE WAS TO PICK A QUARREL WITH THE OUTGOING COMMANDER TWERE EASY ENOUGH HE WAS GREEN WITH ENVY ANYHOW
6784-76150-0014 AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT WE MET ABOUT MID AFTERNOON WITH SECONDS IN A WELL FREQUENTED FIELD IN THE OUTSKIRTS
6784-76150-0015 BEFORE SUPPER WAS EATEN MY ENTIRE TROOP KNEW THAT THEIR NEW CAPTAIN HAD TOSSED HIS BALL SLINGER AWAY WITHOUT USING IT HAD TAKEN TWENTY BALLS FROM THEIR FORMER COMMANDER'S WEAPON
6784-76150-0016 AND WHILE THUS WOUNDED HAD CHARGED THE MAN AND DESPATCHED HIM WITH BARE HANDS NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS EXPLOIT QUITE WON THEIR HEARTS
6784-76150-0017 NONE BUT A BLIND MAN COULD HAVE MISSED THE RESPECT THEY SHOWED ME WHEN ALL BANDAGED AND SORE I LINED THEM UP NEXT MORNING AFTERWARD I LEARNED THAT THEY HAD ALL TAKEN A PLEDGE TO FOLLOW STROKOR THROUGH THE GATES OF HOFE ITSELF
6784-76150-0018 I CALLED MY MEN TOGETHER ONE MORN AS THE SUN ROSE BY THAT TIME I HAD GIVEN THEM A SAMPLE OF MY BRAINS THROUGH ORDERING A REARRANGEMENT OF THEIR QUARTERS SUCH AS MADE THE SAME MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE ALSO
6784-76150-0019 I HAD DEALT WITH ONE SLIGHT INFRACTION OF THE RULES IN SUCH A DRASTIC FASHION THAT THEY KNEW I WOULD BROOK NO TRIFLING ALL TOLD TIS HARD TO SAY WHETHER THEY THOUGHT THE MOST OF ME OR OF JON
6784-76150-0020 MEN SAID I AS BLUNTLY AS I KNEW THE EMPEROR IS AN OLD MAN AND AS YE KNOW HE IS DISPOSED TO BE LENIENT TOWARD THE MEN OF KLOW
6784-76150-0021 NOW I WILL TELL YE MORE IT HAS COME TO ME LATELY THAT KLOW IS PLOTTING TO ATTACK US WITH STRANGE WEAPONS I THOUGHT BEST CONSIDERING THEIR IGNORANCE NOT TO GIVE THEM MY OWN REASONS
6784-76150-0022 OF COURSE I HAVE TOLD THE EMPEROR OF IT YET HE WILL NOT ACT HE SAYS TO WAIT TILL WE ARE ATTACKED I STOPPED AND WATCHED THEIR FACES
6784-76150-0023 SURE ENOUGH THE IDEA FAIR MADE THEM ACHE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE MEN WAS SPOILING FOR A FIGHT NOW TELL ME HOW WOULD YE LIKE TO BECOME THE EMPEROR'S BODY GUARD
6784-76150-0024 I DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT LONG THE LIGHT THAT FLARED IN THEIR FACES TOLD ME PLAINLY AND HOW WOULD YE LIKE TO HAVE ME FOR YOUR EMPEROR
6784-76150-0025 THEY YELLED FOR PURE JOY AND PRESSED ABOUT ME LIKE A PACK OF CHILDREN I SAW THAT THE TIME WAS RIPE FOR ACTION UP THEN I ROARED AND OF COURSE LED THE WAY
6784-76150-0026 WE MET THE EMPEROR'S GUARD ON THE LOWER STAIRS AND FROM THAT POINT ON WE FAIR HACKED OUR WAY THROUGH WELL NO NEED TO DESCRIBE THE FIGHT FOR A TIME I THOUGHT WE WERE GONE
6784-76150-0027 THE GUARDS HAD A CUNNINGLY DEVISED LABYRINTH ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND ATTACKED US FROM HOLES IN A FALSE CEILING SO THAT WE SUFFERED HEAVILY AT FIRST BUT I SAW WHAT WAS AMISS
6784-76150-0028 AND SHOUTED TO MY MEN TO CLEAR AWAY THE TIMBERS AND AFTER THAT IT WAS CLEAR WORK I LOST FORTY MEN BEFORE THE GUARD WAS DISPOSED OF THE EMPEROR I FINISHED MYSELF
6784-76150-0029 HE DODGED RIGHT SPRYLY FOR A TIME BUT AT LAST I CAUGHT HIM AND TOSSED HIM TO THE FOOT OF THE UPPER STAIRS AND THERE HE STILL LIES FOR NONE OF MY MEN WOULD TOUCH HIM NOR WOULD I
6784-76150-0030 WE COVERED HIM WITH QUICKLIME AND SOME EARTH AS SOON AS WE HAD TAKEN CARE OF THOSE WHO WERE NOT TOO FAR GONE I CALLED THE MEN TOGETHER AND CAUSED A ROUND OF SPIRITS TO BE SERVED
6784-76150-0031 THEN WE ALL FEASTED ON THE EMPEROR'S STORE AND SOON WERE FEELING LIKE OURSELVES MEN I SAID IMPRESSIVELY I AM PROUD OF YE
6784-76150-0032 AT THAT THEY ALL GRINNED HAPPILY AND I ADDED AND TIS A FINE STAFF OF GENERALS THAT YE'LL MAKE NEED I SAY MORE
6784-76150-0033 THOSE MEN WOULD HAVE OVERTURNED THE PALACE FOR ME HAD I SAID THE WORD AS IT WAS THEY OBEYED MY NEXT ORDERS IN SUCH A SPIRIT THAT SUCCESS WAS ASSURED FROM THE FIRST
6784-76150-0034 FIRST USING THE DEAD EMPEROR'S NAME I CAUSED THE VARIOUS CHIEFS TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER AT ONCE TO THE COURT CHAMBER AT THE SAME TIME I CONTRIVED BY MEANS I NEED NOT GO INTO HERE
6784-76150-0035 TO PREVENT ANY WORD OF OUR ACTION FROM GETTING ABROAD SO WHEN THE FORMER STAFF FACED ME THE NEXT MORNING THEY LEARNED THAT THEY WERE TO BE EXECUTED I COULD TRUST NOT ONE THEY WERE ALL FRIENDS OF THE OLD MAN
6784-76150-0036 WITH THE CHIEFS OUT OF THE WAY AND MY OWN MEN TAKING THEIR COMMANDS THE WHOLE ARMY FELL INTO MY HANDS TRUE THERE WERE SOME INSURRECTIONS HERE AND THERE BUT MY MEN HANDLED THEM WITH SUCH SPEED AND HARSHNESS
6784-76150-0037 THAT ANY FURTHER STUBBORNNESS TURNED TO ADMIRATION BY THIS TIME THE FAME OF STROKOR WAS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE EMPIRE AND THUS IT CAME ABOUT THAT
6784-76150-0038 STROKOR SON OF STROK REIGNED THROUGHOUT VLAMALAND
