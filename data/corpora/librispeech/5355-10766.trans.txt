5355-10766-0000 AND GLAD ENOUGH HE WAS OF THE OPPORTUNITY AS ANYONE MAY GUESS FOR WHEN YOU CONSIDER A BRISK LIVELY YOUNG MAN OF ONE AND TWENTY AND A SWEET BEAUTIFUL MISS OF SEVENTEEN SO THROWN TOGETHER DAY AFTER DAY FOR TWO WEEKS
5355-10766-0001 THE WEATHER BEING VERY FAIR AS I HAVE SAID AND THE SHIP TOSSING AND BOWLING ALONG BEFORE A FINE HUMMING BREEZE THAT SENT WHITE CAPS ALL OVER THE SEA AND WITH NOTHING TO DO BUT SIT
5355-10766-0002 AND LOOK AT THAT BLUE SEA AND THE BRIGHT SKY OVERHEAD IT IS NOT HARD TO SUPPOSE WHAT WAS TO BEFALL AND WHAT PLEASURE IT WAS TO BARNABY TRUE TO SHOW ATTENTION TO HER BUT OH
5355-10766-0003 THOSE DAYS WHEN A MAN IS YOUNG AND WHETHER WISELY OR NO FALLEN IN LOVE HOW OFTEN DURING THAT VOYAGE DID OUR HERO LIE AWAKE IN HIS BERTH AT NIGHT TOSSING THIS WAY AND THAT WITHOUT SLEEP
5355-10766-0004 NOT THAT HE WANTED TO SLEEP IF HE COULD BUT WOULD RATHER LIE SO AWAKE THINKING ABOUT HER AND STARING INTO THE DARKNESS POOR FOOL HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT THE END MUST COME TO SUCH A FOOL'S PARADISE BEFORE VERY LONG
5355-10766-0005 FOR WHO WAS HE TO LOOK UP TO SIR JOHN MALYOE'S GRANDDAUGHTER HE THE SUPERCARGO OF A MERCHANT SHIP AND SHE THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A BARONET NEVERTHELESS
5355-10766-0006 THINGS WENT ALONG VERY SMOOTH AND PLEASANT UNTIL ONE EVENING WHEN ALL CAME OF A SUDDEN TO AN END AT THAT TIME HE AND THE YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN STANDING FOR A LONG WHILE TOGETHER
5355-10766-0007 LEANING OVER THE RAIL AND LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE WATER THROUGH THE DUSK TOWARD THE WESTWARD WHERE THE SKY WAS STILL OF A LINGERING BRIGHTNESS SHE HAD BEEN MIGHTILY QUIET AND DULL ALL THAT EVENING BUT NOW OF A SUDDEN
5355-10766-0008 CAPTAIN MALYOE WHO WAS STATIONED IN GARRISON AT THAT PLACE THEN SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT CAPTAIN MALYOE WAS THE NEXT HEIR TO THE DEVONSHIRE ESTATE
5355-10766-0009 BUT POOR BARNABY WHAT A FOOL WAS HE TO BE SURE METHINKS WHEN SHE FIRST BEGAN TO SPEAK ABOUT CAPTAIN MALYOE HE KNEW WHAT WAS COMING BUT NOW THAT SHE HAD TOLD HIM HE COULD SAY NOTHING BUT STOOD THERE
5355-10766-0010 STARING ACROSS THE OCEAN HIS BREATH COMING HOT AND DRY AS ASHES IN HIS THROAT SHE POOR THING WENT ON TO SAY IN A VERY LOW VOICE THAT SHE HAD LIKED HIM FROM THE VERY FIRST MOMENT SHE HAD SEEN HIM
5355-10766-0011 AND HAD BEEN VERY HAPPY FOR THESE DAYS AND WOULD ALWAYS THINK OF HIM AS A DEAR FRIEND WHO HAD BEEN VERY KIND TO HER WHO HAD SO LITTLE PLEASURE IN LIFE AND SO WOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER HIM THEN
5355-10766-0012 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT UNTIL AT LAST BARNABY MADE SHIFT TO SAY THOUGH IN A HOARSE AND CROAKING VOICE THAT CAPTAIN MALYOE MUST BE A VERY HAPPY MAN AND THAT IF HE WERE IN CAPTAIN MALYOE'S PLACE
5355-10766-0013 HE WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD THUS HAVING SPOKEN AND SO FOUND HIS TONGUE HE WENT ON TO TELL HER WITH HIS HEAD ALL IN A WHIRL THAT HE TOO LOVED HER
5355-10766-0014 AND THAT WHAT SHE HAD TOLD HIM STRUCK HIM TO THE HEART AND MADE HIM THE MOST MISERABLE UNHAPPY WRETCH IN THE WHOLE WORLD SHE WAS NOT ANGRY AT WHAT HE SAID NOR DID SHE TURN TO LOOK AT HIM
5355-10766-0015 FOR THAT HE WAS INDEED A TERRIBLE MAN TO THIS POOR BARNABY COULD ONLY REPEAT THAT HE LOVED HER WITH ALL HIS HEART THAT HE HAD HOPED FOR NOTHING IN HIS LOVE
5355-10766-0016 BUT THAT HE WAS NOW THE MOST MISERABLE MAN IN THE WORLD IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT SO TRAGIC FOR HIM THAT SOME ONE WHO HAD BEEN HIDING NIGH THEM ALL THE WHILE SUDDENLY MOVED AWAY
5355-10766-0017 AND BARNABY TRUE COULD SEE IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS THAT IT WAS THAT VILLAIN MANSERVANT OF SIR JOHN MALYOE'S AND KNEW THAT HE MUST HAVE OVERHEARD ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID THE MAN WENT STRAIGHT TO THE GREAT CABIN
5355-10766-0018 AND POOR BARNABY HIS BRAIN ALL ATINGLE STOOD LOOKING AFTER HIM FEELING THAT NOW INDEED THE LAST DROP OF BITTERNESS HAD BEEN ADDED TO HIS TROUBLE TO HAVE SUCH A WRETCH OVERHEAR WHAT HE HAD SAID
5355-10766-0019 THE YOUNG LADY COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THE FELLOW FOR SHE CONTINUED LEANING OVER THE RAIL AND BARNABY TRUE STANDING AT HER SIDE NOT MOVING BUT IN SUCH A TUMULT OF MANY PASSIONS THAT HE WAS LIKE ONE BEWILDERED
5355-10766-0020 AND HIS HEART BEATING AS THOUGH TO SMOTHER HIM SO THEY STOOD FOR I KNOW NOT HOW LONG WHEN OF A SUDDEN SIR JOHN MALYOE COMES RUNNING OUT OF THE CABIN WITHOUT HIS HAT
5355-10766-0021 BUT CARRYING HIS GOLD HEADED CANE AND SO STRAIGHT ACROSS THE DECK TO WHERE BARNABY AND THE YOUNG LADY STOOD THAT SPYING WRETCH CLOSE AT HIS HEELS GRINNING LIKE AN IMP YOU HUSSY
5355-10766-0022 SHRINKING BACK ALMOST UPON THE DECK CROUCHED AS THOUGH TO ESCAPE SUCH A BLOW YOU HUSSY HE BAWLED OUT WITH VILE OATHS TOO HORRIBLE HERE TO BE SET DOWN
5355-10766-0023 WHAT WITH THE WHIRLING OF BARNABY'S BRAINS AND THE PASSION INTO WHICH HE WAS ALREADY MELTED WHAT WITH HIS DESPAIR AND HIS LOVE AND HIS ANGER AT THIS ADDRESS
5355-10766-0024 HE WOULD WRENCH THE STICK OUT OF HIS HAND AND THROW IT OVERBOARD SIR JOHN WENT STAGGERING BACK WITH THE PUSH BARNABY GAVE HIM AND THEN CAUGHT HIMSELF UP AGAIN THEN WITH A GREAT BELLOW
5355-10766-0025 RAN ROARING AT OUR HERO WHIRLING HIS CANE ABOUT AND I DO BELIEVE WOULD HAVE STRUCK HIM AND GOD KNOWS THEN WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HAD NOT HIS MANSERVANT CAUGHT HIM AND HELD HIM BACK KEEP BACK
5355-10766-0026 KEEP BACK IF YOU STRIKE ME WITH THAT STICK I'LL FLING YOU OVERBOARD BY THIS TIME WHAT WITH THE SOUND OF LOUD VOICES AND THE STAMPING OF FEET SOME OF THE CREW AND OTHERS ABOARD WERE HURRYING UP AND THE NEXT MOMENT
5355-10766-0027 AND WHO ARE YOU ANYHOW HE CRIED OUT TO THREATEN TO STRIKE ME AND TO INSULT ME WHO AM AS GOOD AS YOU YOU DARE NOT STRIKE ME
5355-10766-0028 BUT STOOD STOCK STILL HIS GREAT BULGING EYES STARING AS THOUGH THEY WOULD POP OUT OF HIS HEAD WHAT'S ALL THIS CRIES CAPTAIN MANLY BUSTLING UP TO THEM WITH MISTER FREESDEN WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN
5355-10766-0029 BUT AS I HAVE SAID OUR HERO WAS TOO FAR GONE NOW TO CONTAIN HIMSELF UNTIL ALL THAT HE HAD TO SAY WAS OUT THE DAMNED VILLAIN INSULTED ME AND INSULTED THE YOUNG LADY HE CRIED OUT
5355-10766-0030 PANTING IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS PASSION AND THEN HE THREATENED TO STRIKE ME WITH HIS CANE BUT I KNOW WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE IS I KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT IN HIS CABIN IN THOSE TWO TRUNKS AND WHERE HE FOUND IT
5355-10766-0031 AND WHOM IT BELONGS TO HE FOUND IT ON THE SHORES OF THE RIO COBRA RIVER AND I HAVE ONLY TO OPEN MY MOUTH AND TELL WHAT I KNOW ABOUT IT AT THIS CAPTAIN MANLY CLAPPED HIS HAND UPON OUR HERO'S SHOULDER
5355-10766-0032 SO THAT HE COULD SCARCELY STAND CALLING OUT TO HIM THE WHILE TO BE SILENT WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE CRIED AN OFFICER OF THIS SHIP
5355-10766-0033 AT THIS MASTER BARNABY CAME SOMEWHAT BACK TO HIMSELF AND INTO HIS WITS AGAIN WITH A JUMP
5355-10766-0034 HAD HE SEEN WHEN SHE HAD GONE NOR WHITHER SHE WENT AS FOR SIR JOHN MALYOE HE STOOD IN THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN HIS FACE GONE AS WHITE AS ASHES AND I DO BELIEVE IF A LOOK COULD KILL
5355-10766-0035 THE DREADFUL MALEVOLENT STARE HE FIXED UPON BARNABY TRUE WOULD HAVE SLAIN HIM WHERE HE STOOD AFTER CAPTAIN MANLY HAD SO SHAKEN SOME WITS INTO POOR BARNABY HE UNHAPPY WRETCH
5355-10766-0036 AND THERE SHUTTING THE DOOR UPON HIMSELF AND FLINGING HIMSELF DOWN ALL DRESSED AS HE WAS UPON HIS BERTH YIELDED HIMSELF OVER TO THE PROFOUNDEST PASSION OF HUMILIATION AND DESPAIR
5355-10766-0037 THERE HE LAY FOR I KNOW NOT HOW LONG STARING INTO THE DARKNESS UNTIL BY AND BY IN SPITE OF HIS SUFFERING AND HIS DESPAIR HE DOZED OFF INTO A LOOSE SLEEP
5355-10766-0038 THAT WAS MORE LIKE WAKING THAN SLEEP BEING POSSESSED CONTINUALLY BY THE MOST VIVID AND DISTASTEFUL DREAMS FROM WHICH HE WOULD AWAKEN ONLY TO DOZE OFF AND TO DREAM AGAIN
5355-10766-0039 IT WAS FROM THE MIDST OF ONE OF THESE EXTRAVAGANT DREAMS THAT HE WAS SUDDENLY AROUSED BY THE NOISE OF A PISTOL SHOT AND THEN THE NOISE OF ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THEN A GREAT BUMP AND A GRINDING JAR
5355-10766-0040 RUNNING ACROSS THE DECK AND DOWN INTO THE GREAT CABIN THEN CAME A TREMENDOUS UPROAR OF VOICES IN THE GREAT CABIN
5355-10766-0041 STRIKING VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE PARTITIONS AND BULKHEADS AT THE SAME INSTANT AROSE A SCREAMING OF WOMEN'S VOICES AND ONE VOICE
5355-10766-0042 CRYING OUT AS IN THE GREATEST EXTREMITY YOU VILLAINS YOU DAMNED VILLAINS AND WITH THE SUDDEN DETONATION OF A PISTOL FIRED INTO THE CLOSE SPACE OF THE GREAT CABIN
5355-10766-0043 BARNABY WAS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS CABIN IN A MOMENT AND TAKING ONLY TIME ENOUGH TO SNATCH DOWN ONE OF THE PISTOLS THAT HUNG AT THE HEAD OF HIS BERTH FLUNG OUT INTO THE GREAT CABIN
5355-10766-0044 TO FIND IT AS BLACK AS NIGHT THE LANTERN SLUNG THERE HAVING BEEN EITHER BLOWN OUT OR DASHED OUT INTO DARKNESS THE PRODIGIOUSLY DARK SPACE WAS FULL OF UPROAR THE HUBBUB AND CONFUSION PIERCED THROUGH AND THROUGH BY THAT
5355-10766-0045 KEEN SOUND OF WOMEN'S VOICES SCREAMING ONE IN THE CABIN AND THE OTHER IN THE STATEROOM BEYOND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BARNABY PITCHED HEADLONG OVER TWO OR THREE STRUGGLING MEN SCUFFLING TOGETHER UPON THE DECK
5355-10766-0046 YOU BLOODY PIRATE WOULD YOU CHOKE ME TO DEATH WHEREWITH SOME NOTION OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED CAME TO HIM LIKE A FLASH AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN ATTACKED IN THE NIGHT BY PIRATES LOOKING TOWARD THE COMPANIONWAY
5355-10766-0047 HE SAW OUTLINED AGAINST THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT WITHOUT THE BLACKER FORM OF A MAN'S FIGURE STANDING STILL AND MOTIONLESS AS A STATUE IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS HUBBUB AND SO BY SOME INSTINCT HE KNEW IN A MOMENT
5355-10766-0048 THAT THAT MUST BE THE MASTER MAKER OF ALL THIS DEVIL'S BREW THEREWITH STILL KNEELING UPON THE DECK HE COVERED THE BOSOM OF THAT SHADOWY FIGURE POINT BLANK AS HE THOUGHT WITH HIS PISTOL
5355-10766-0049 AND INSTANTLY PULLED THE TRIGGER IN THE FLASH OF RED LIGHT AND IN THE INSTANT STUNNING REPORT OF THE PISTOL SHOT BARNABY SAW AS STAMPED UPON THE BLACKNESS A BROAD FLAT FACE
5355-10766-0050 WITH FISHY EYES A LEAN BONY FOREHEAD WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GREAT BLOTCH OF BLOOD UPON THE SIDE A COCKED HAT TRIMMED WITH GOLD LACE A RED SCARF ACROSS THE BREAST
5355-10766-0051 MY GOD TIS WILLIAM BRAND THEREWITH CAME THE SOUND OF SOME ONE FALLING HEAVILY DOWN THE NEXT MOMENT BARNABY'S SIGHT COMING BACK TO HIM AGAIN IN THE DARKNESS
5355-10766-0052 THAT A LEADEN BULLET MIGHT DO IT NO HARM THOUGH IF IT WAS INDEED AN APPARITION THAT BARNABY BEHELD IN THAT MOMENT THERE IS THIS TO SAY THAT HE SAW IT AS PLAIN AS EVER HE SAW A LIVING MAN IN
5355-10766-0053 ALL OF HIS LIFE THIS WAS THE LAST OUR HERO KNEW FOR THE NEXT MOMENT SOMEBODY WHETHER BY ACCIDENT OR DESIGN HE NEVER KNEW STRUCK HIM SUCH A TERRIBLE VIOLENT BLOW UPON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
5355-10766-0054 THAT HE SAW FORTY THOUSAND STARS FLASH BEFORE HIS EYEBALLS AND THEN WITH A GREAT HUMMING IN HIS HEAD SWOONED DEAD AWAY
5355-10766-0055 WHEN BARNABY TRUE CAME BACK TO HIS SENSES AGAIN IT WAS TO FIND HIMSELF BEING CARED FOR WITH GREAT SKILL AND NICETY HIS HEAD BATHED WITH COLD WATER AND A BANDAGE BEING BOUND ABOUT IT
5355-10766-0056 AS CAREFULLY AS THOUGH A CHIRURGEON WAS ATTENDING TO HIM HE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY RECALL WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM NOR UNTIL HE HAD OPENED HIS EYES TO FIND HIMSELF IN A STRANGE CABIN EXTREMELY WELL FITTED AND PAINTED WITH WHITE AND GOLD
5355-10766-0057 THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN SHINING IN HIS EYES TOGETHER WITH THE GRAY OF THE EARLY DAYLIGHT THROUGH THE DEAD EYE TWO MEN WERE BENDING OVER HIM ONE A NEGRO IN A STRIPED SHIRT WITH A YELLOW HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS HEAD
5355-10766-0058 AND SILVER EARRINGS IN HIS EARS THE OTHER A WHITE MAN CLAD IN A STRANGE OUTLANDISH DRESS OF A FOREIGN MAKE AND WITH GREAT MUSTACHIOS HANGING DOWN AND WITH GOLD EARRINGS IN HIS EARS
5355-10766-0059 HE SHUT HIS EYES AGAIN CONTRIVING WITH GREAT EFFORT TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM GROANING ALOUD AND WONDERING AS TO WHAT SORT OF PIRATES THESE COULD BE WHO WOULD FIRST KNOCK A MAN IN THE HEAD SO TERRIBLE A BLOW AS THAT WHICH HE HAD SUFFERED
5355-10766-0060 AND THEN TAKE SUCH CARE TO FETCH HIM BACK TO LIFE AGAIN AND TO MAKE HIM EASY AND COMFORTABLE NOR DID HE OPEN HIS EYES AGAIN BUT LAY THERE GATHERING HIS WITS TOGETHER AND WONDERING THUS
5355-10766-0061 SEEING THAT IT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM TO MEET SOME ONE WITHOUT AROSE THOUGH WITH A GOOD DEAL OF EFFORT AND PERMITTED THE NEGRO TO HELP HIM ON WITH HIS COAT STILL FEELING MIGHTILY DIZZY AND UNCERTAIN UPON HIS LEGS
