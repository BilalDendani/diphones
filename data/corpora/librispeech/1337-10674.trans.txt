1337-10674-0000 I WAS TAUGHT FIRST TO READ AND WRITE AND THEN TO LEARN THE KORAN WHICH IS THE BASIS OF OUR HOLY RELIGION AND THE BETTER TO UNDERSTAND IT I READ WITH MY TUTORS THE ABLEST COMMENTATORS ON ITS TEACHING AND COMMITTED TO MEMORY ALL THE TRADITIONS RESPECTING THE PROPHET
1337-10674-0001 WHICH HAVE BEEN GATHERED FROM THE MOUTH OF THOSE WHO WERE HIS FRIENDS I ALSO LEARNT HISTORY AND WAS INSTRUCTED IN POETRY VERSIFICATION GEOGRAPHY CHRONOLOGY AND IN ALL THE OUTDOOR EXERCISES IN WHICH EVERY PRINCE SHOULD EXCEL
1337-10674-0002 BUT WHAT I LIKED BEST OF ALL WAS WRITING ARABIC CHARACTERS AND IN THIS I SOON SURPASSED MY MASTERS AND GAINED A REPUTATION IN THIS BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE THAT REACHED AS FAR AS INDIA ITSELF
1337-10674-0003 NOW THE SULTAN OF THE INDIES CURIOUS TO SEE A YOUNG PRINCE WITH SUCH STRANGE TASTES SENT AN AMBASSADOR TO MY FATHER LADEN WITH RICH PRESENTS AND A WARM INVITATION TO VISIT HIS COURT
1337-10674-0004 MY FATHER WHO WAS DEEPLY ANXIOUS TO SECURE THE FRIENDSHIP OF SO POWERFUL A MONARCH AND HELD BESIDES THAT A LITTLE TRAVEL WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE MY MANNERS AND OPEN MY MIND ACCEPTED GLADLY AND IN A SHORT TIME I HAD SET OUT FOR INDIA WITH THE AMBASSADOR
1337-10674-0005 ATTENDED ONLY BY A SMALL SUITE ON ACCOUNT OF THE LENGTH OF THE JOURNEY AND THE BADNESS OF THE ROADS HOWEVER AS WAS MY DUTY I TOOK WITH ME TEN CAMELS LADEN WITH RICH PRESENTS FOR THE SULTAN
1337-10674-0006 AND AS SOON AS IT CAME NEAR WE FOUND THAT THE DUST CONCEALED A BAND OF FIFTY ROBBERS OUR MEN BARELY NUMBERED HALF
1337-10674-0007 SO WE TRIED TO OVERAWE THEM BY INFORMING THEM WHO WE WERE AND WHITHER WE WERE GOING THE ROBBERS HOWEVER ONLY LAUGHED AND DECLARED THAT WAS NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS AND WITHOUT MORE WORDS ATTACKED US BRUTALLY
1337-10674-0008 AND THAT THE AMBASSADOR AND ALL OUR FOLLOWERS WERE MADE PRISONERS I PUT SPURS TO MY HORSE AND RODE AWAY AS FAST AS I COULD TILL THE POOR BEAST FELL DEAD FROM A WOUND IN HIS SIDE I MANAGED TO JUMP OFF WITHOUT ANY INJURY AND LOOKED ABOUT TO SEE IF I WAS PURSUED
1337-10674-0009 I FOUND MYSELF IN A COUNTRY THAT WAS QUITE NEW TO ME AND DARED NOT RETURN TO THE MAIN ROAD LEST I SHOULD AGAIN FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE ROBBERS LUCKILY MY WOUND WAS ONLY A SLIGHT ONE AND AFTER BINDING IT UP AS WELL AS I COULD I WALKED ON FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
1337-10674-0010 TILL I REACHED A CAVE AT THE FOOT OF A MOUNTAIN WHERE I PASSED THE NIGHT IN PEACE MAKING MY SUPPER OFF SOME FRUITS I HAD GATHERED ON THE WAY I WANDERED ABOUT FOR A WHOLE MONTH WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I WAS GOING
1337-10674-0011 TILL AT LENGTH I FOUND MYSELF ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A BEAUTIFUL CITY WATERED BY WINDING STREAMS WHICH ENJOYED AN ETERNAL SPRING
1337-10674-0012 MY FACE AND HANDS HAD BEEN BURNED NEARLY BLACK MY CLOTHES WERE ALL IN RAGS AND MY SHOES WERE IN SUCH A STATE THAT I HAD BEEN FORCED TO ABANDON THEM ALTOGETHER I ENTERED THE TOWN AND STOPPED AT A TAILOR'S SHOP TO INQUIRE WHERE I WAS
1337-10674-0013 THE MAN SAW I WAS BETTER THAN MY CONDITION AND BEGGED ME TO SIT DOWN AND IN RETURN I TOLD HIM MY WHOLE STORY THE TAILOR LISTENED WITH ATTENTION BUT HIS REPLY INSTEAD OF GIVING ME CONSOLATION ONLY INCREASED MY TROUBLE BEWARE HE SAID
1337-10674-0014 OF TELLING ANY ONE WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME FOR THE PRINCE WHO GOVERNS THE KINGDOM IS YOUR FATHER'S GREATEST ENEMY AND HE WILL BE REJOICED TO FIND YOU IN HIS POWER I THANKED THE TAILOR FOR HIS COUNSEL AND SAID I WOULD DO WHATEVER HE ADVISED THEN BEING VERY HUNGRY
1337-10674-0015 IN A FEW DAYS I HAD QUITE RECOVERED FROM THE HARDSHIPS I HAD UNDERGONE AND THEN THE TAILOR KNOWING THAT IT WAS THE CUSTOM FOR THE PRINCES OF OUR RELIGION TO LEARN A TRADE OR PROFESSION SO AS TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES
1337-10674-0016 INQUIRED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING I COULD DO FOR MY LIVING
1337-10674-0017 ALL THAT IS OF NO USE HERE SAID THE TAILOR TAKE MY ADVICE PUT ON A SHORT COAT AND AS YOU SEEM HARDY AND STRONG GO INTO THE WOODS AND CUT FIREWOOD WHICH YOU WILL SELL IN THE STREETS BY THIS MEANS YOU WILL EARN YOUR LIVING AND BE ABLE TO WAIT TILL BETTER TIMES COME
1337-10674-0018 THE HATCHET AND THE CORD SHALL BE MY PRESENT THIS COUNSEL WAS VERY DISTASTEFUL TO ME BUT I THOUGHT I COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN ADOPT IT SO THE NEXT MORNING I SET OUT WITH A COMPANY OF POOR WOOD CUTTERS TO WHOM THE TAILOR HAD INTRODUCED ME
1337-10674-0019 EVEN ON THE FIRST DAY I CUT ENOUGH WOOD TO SELL FOR A TOLERABLE SUM AND VERY SOON I BECAME MORE EXPERT AND HAD MADE ENOUGH MONEY TO REPAY THE TAILOR ALL HE HAD LENT ME I HAD BEEN A WOOD CUTTER FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WHEN
1337-10674-0020 ONE DAY I WANDERED FURTHER INTO THE FOREST THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE AND REACHED A DELICIOUS GREEN GLADE WHERE I BEGAN TO CUT WOOD I WAS HACKING AT THE ROOT OF A TREE WHEN I BEHELD AN IRON RING FASTENED TO A TRAPDOOR OF THE SAME METAL I SOON CLEARED AWAY THE EARTH
1337-10674-0021 AND PULLING UP THE DOOR FOUND A STAIRCASE WHICH I HASTILY MADE UP MY MIND TO GO DOWN CARRYING MY HATCHET WITH ME BY WAY OF PROTECTION WHEN I REACHED THE BOTTOM I DISCOVERED THAT I WAS IN A HUGE PALACE AS BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AS ANY PALACE ABOVE GROUND THAT I HAD EVER SEEN
1337-10674-0022 WITH A LONG GALLERY SUPPORTED BY PILLARS OF JASPER ORNAMENTED WITH CAPITALS OF GOLD DOWN THIS GALLERY A LADY CAME TO MEET ME OF SUCH BEAUTY THAT I FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND THOUGHT ONLY OF HER TO SAVE HER ALL THE TROUBLE POSSIBLE I HASTENED TOWARDS HER
1337-10674-0023 SHE ASKED AGAIN WITH A SIGH I HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE NOW FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS AND YOU ARE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS VISITED ME EMBOLDENED BY HER BEAUTY AND GENTLENESS I VENTURED TO REPLY BEFORE MADAM I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
1337-10674-0024 ALLOW ME TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THIS MEETING WHICH IS NOT ONLY A CONSOLATION TO ME IN MY OWN HEAVY SORROW BUT MAY PERHAPS ENABLE ME TO RENDER YOUR LOT HAPPIER AND THEN I TOLD HER WHO I WAS AND HOW I HAD COME THERE ALAS PRINCE
1337-10674-0025 SHE SAID WITH A DEEPER SIGH THAN BEFORE
1337-10674-0026 AT MY FATHER'S DESIRE I WAS MARRIED TO A PRINCE WHO WAS MY OWN COUSIN BUT ON MY VERY WEDDING DAY I WAS SNATCHED UP BY A GENIUS AND BROUGHT HERE IN A FAINT FOR A LONG WHILE I DID NOTHING BUT WEEP AND WOULD NOT SUFFER THE GENIUS TO COME NEAR ME
1337-10674-0027 BUT TIME TEACHES US SUBMISSION AND I HAVE NOW GOT ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND IF CLOTHES AND JEWELS COULD CONTENT ME I HAVE THEM IN PLENTY EVERY TENTH DAY FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS I HAVE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HIM
1337-10674-0028 BUT IN CASE I SHOULD NEED HIS HELP AT ANY OTHER TIME I HAVE ONLY TO TOUCH A TALISMAN THAT STANDS AT THE ENTRANCE OF MY CHAMBER IT WANTS STILL FIVE DAYS TO HIS NEXT VISIT AND I HOPE THAT DURING THAT TIME YOU WILL DO ME THE HONOUR TO BE MY GUEST
1337-10674-0029 I WAS TOO MUCH DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY TO DREAM OF REFUSING HER OFFER AND ACCORDINGLY THE PRINCESS HAD ME CONDUCTED TO THE BATH AND A RICH DRESS BEFITTING MY RANK WAS PROVIDED FOR ME THEN A FEAST OF THE MOST DELICATE DISHES WAS SERVED IN A ROOM HUNG WITH EMBROIDERED INDIAN FABRICS
1337-10674-0030 NEXT DAY WHEN WE WERE AT DINNER I COULD MAINTAIN MY PATIENCE NO LONGER AND IMPLORED THE PRINCESS TO BREAK HER BONDS AND RETURN WITH ME TO THE WORLD WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY THE SUN WHAT YOU ASK IS IMPOSSIBLE SHE ANSWERED
1337-10674-0031 BUT STAY HERE WITH ME INSTEAD AND WE CAN BE HAPPY AND ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IS TO BETAKE YOURSELF TO THE FOREST EVERY TENTH DAY WHEN I AM EXPECTING MY MASTER THE GENIUS HE IS VERY JEALOUS AS YOU KNOW AND WILL NOT SUFFER A MAN TO COME NEAR ME
1337-10674-0032 PRINCESS I REPLIED I SEE IT IS ONLY FEAR OF THE GENIUS THAT MAKES YOU ACT LIKE THIS FOR MYSELF I DREAD HIM SO LITTLE THAT I MEAN TO BREAK HIS TALISMAN IN PIECES AWFUL THOUGH YOU THINK HIM HE SHALL FEEL THE WEIGHT OF MY ARM
1337-10674-0033 AND I HEREWITH TAKE A SOLEMN VOW TO STAMP OUT THE WHOLE RACE THE PRINCESS WHO REALIZED THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AUDACITY ENTREATED ME NOT TO TOUCH THE TALISMAN IF YOU DO IT WILL BE THE RUIN OF BOTH OF US SAID SHE I KNOW GENII MUCH BETTER THAN YOU
1337-10674-0034 I GAVE ONE KICK TO THE TALISMAN AND IT FELL INTO A THOUSAND PIECES HARDLY HAD MY FOOT TOUCHED THE TALISMAN WHEN THE AIR BECAME AS DARK AS NIGHT A FEARFUL NOISE WAS HEARD AND THE PALACE SHOOK TO ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS IN AN INSTANT I WAS SOBERED AND UNDERSTOOD WHAT I HAD DONE
1337-10674-0035 BUT I WAS TOO LATE THE PALACE OPENED AND THE GENIUS APPEARED WHO TURNING ANGRILY TO THE PRINCESS ASKED INDIGNANTLY
1337-10674-0036 A PAIN IN MY HEART SHE REPLIED HASTILY OBLIGED ME TO SEEK THE AID OF THIS LITTLE BOTTLE FEELING FAINT I SLIPPED AND FELL AGAINST THE TALISMAN WHICH BROKE THAT IS REALLY ALL YOU ARE AN IMPUDENT LIAR CRIED THE GENIUS
1337-10674-0037 HOW DID THIS HATCHET AND THOSE SHOES GET HERE I NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE SHE ANSWERED
1337-10674-0038 TO THIS THE GENIUS ONLY REPLIED BY INSULTS AND BLOWS I COULD HEAR THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF THE PRINCESS AND HAVING BY THIS TIME TAKEN OFF MY RICH GARMENTS AND PUT ON THOSE IN WHICH I HAD ARRIVED THE PREVIOUS DAY I LIFTED THE TRAP FOUND MYSELF ONCE MORE IN THE FOREST
1337-10674-0039 WITH A LIGHT LOAD OF WOOD AND A HEART FULL OF SHAME AND SORROW THE TAILOR WHO HAD BEEN UNEASY AT MY LONG ABSENCE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ME
1337-10674-0040 THE TAILOR NOTICED MY CONFUSION AND WAS JUST GOING TO INQUIRE THE REASON WHEN THE DOOR OF THE ROOM OPENED AND THE OLD MAN APPEARED CARRYING WITH HIM MY HATCHET AND SHOES I AM A GENIUS HE SAID THE SON OF THE DAUGHTER OF EBLIS PRINCE OF THE GENII
1337-10674-0041 IS NOT THIS HATCHET YOURS AND THESE SHOES WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER WHICH INDEED I COULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM SO GREAT WAS MY FRIGHT HE SEIZED HOLD OF ME AND DARTED UP INTO THE AIR WITH THE QUICKNESS OF LIGHTNING AND THEN WITH EQUAL SWIFTNESS DROPPED DOWN TOWARDS THE EARTH
1337-10674-0042 WHEN HE TOUCHED THE GROUND HE RAPPED IT WITH HIS FOOT IT OPENED AND WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE ENCHANTED PALACE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS OF THE EBONY ISLE BUT HOW DIFFERENT SHE LOOKED FROM WHAT SHE WAS WHEN I HAD LAST SEEN HER
1337-10674-0043 FOR SHE WAS LYING STRETCHED ON THE GROUND COVERED WITH BLOOD AND WEEPING BITTERLY TRAITRESS CRIED THE GENIUS IS NOT THIS MAN YOUR LOVER SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES SLOWLY AND LOOKED SADLY AT ME I NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE SHE ANSWERED SLOWLY
1337-10674-0044 I DO NOT KNOW WHO HE IS WHAT EXCLAIMED THE GENIUS
1337-10674-0045 BUT IF HE REALLY IS A STRANGER TO ME SHE REPLIED
1337-10674-0046 VERY WELL SAID THE GENIUS DRAWING HIS SWORD TAKE THIS AND CUT OFF HIS HEAD ALAS ANSWERED THE PRINCESS I AM TOO WEAK EVEN TO HOLD THE SABRE AND SUPPOSING THAT I HAD THE STRENGTH WHY SHOULD I PUT AN INNOCENT MAN TO DEATH
1337-10674-0047 HOW SHOULD I WHEN I NEVER SAW HER BEFORE CUT HER HEAD OFF THEN IF SHE IS A STRANGER TO YOU AND I SHALL BELIEVE YOU ARE SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND WILL SET YOU AT LIBERTY
1337-10674-0048 BUT THE LOOK OF GRATITUDE SHE GAVE ME SHOOK MY COURAGE AND I FLUNG THE SABRE TO THE EARTH I SHOULD NOT DESERVE TO LIVE I SAID TO THE GENIUS IF I WERE SUCH A COWARD AS TO SLAY A LADY WHO IS NOT ONLY UNKNOWN TO ME BUT WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT HALF DEAD HERSELF
1337-10674-0049 DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM IN YOUR POWER BUT I REFUSE TO OBEY YOUR CRUEL COMMAND I SEE SAID THE GENIUS THAT YOU HAVE BOTH MADE UP YOUR MINDS TO BRAVE ME BUT I WILL GIVE YOU A SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU MAY EXPECT
1337-10674-0050 SO SAYING WITH ONE SWEEP OF HIS SABRE HE CUT OFF A HAND OF THE PRINCESS
1337-10674-0051 THEN I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF I IMPLORED THE GENIUS TO KEEP ME NO LONGER IN THIS STATE OF SUSPENSE
1337-10674-0052 THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH A GENIUS TREATS THE WOMAN WHO HAS BETRAYED HIM IF I CHOSE I COULD KILL YOU ALSO BUT I WILL BE MERCIFUL AND CONTENT MYSELF WITH CHANGING YOU INTO A DOG AN ASS A LION OR A BIRD WHICHEVER YOU PREFER
