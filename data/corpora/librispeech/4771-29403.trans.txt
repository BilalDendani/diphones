4771-29403-0000 CHAPTER FOUR HE EXPLAINS HIMSELF GILES TOLLER'S MISERLY NATURE HAD OFFERED TO HIS LODGER SHELTER FROM WIND AND RAIN AND THE FURNITURE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO MAKE A BEDROOM HABITABLE AND NOTHING MORE
4771-29403-0001 THERE WAS NO CARPET ON THE FLOOR NO PAPER ON THE WALLS NO CEILING TO HIDE THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF THE CHAIR THAT I SAT ON WAS THE ONE CHAIR IN THE ROOM THE MAN WHOSE GUEST I HAD RASHLY CONSENTED TO BE FOUND A SEAT ON HIS BED UPON HIS TABLE I SAW PENS AND PENCILS PAPER AND INK
4771-29403-0002 AND A BATTERED BRASS CANDLESTICK WITH A COMMON TALLOW CANDLE IN IT HIS CHANGES OF CLOTHING WERE FLUNG ON THE BED HIS MONEY WAS LEFT ON THE UNPAINTED WOODEN CHIMNEY PIECE HIS WRETCHED LITTLE MORSEL OF LOOKING GLASS PROPPED UP NEAR THE MONEY HAD BEEN TURNED WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
4771-29403-0003 HE PERCEIVED THAT THE ODD POSITION OF THIS LAST OBJECT HAD ATTRACTED MY NOTICE VANITY AND I HAVE PARTED COMPANY HE EXPLAINED I SHRINK FROM MYSELF WHEN I LOOK AT MYSELF NOW
4771-29403-0004 IF HE HAS GOT HIS HEARING IS A MORE AGREEABLE MAN IN SOCIETY THAN I AM
4771-29403-0005 I WROTE MY REPLY THE PLACE MAKES ME SORRY FOR YOU HE SHOOK HIS HEAD YOUR SYMPATHY IS THROWN AWAY ON ME A MAN WHO HAS LOST HIS SOCIAL RELATIONS WITH HIS FELLOW CREATURES DOESN'T CARE HOW HE LODGES OR WHERE HE LIVES WHEN HE HAS FOUND SOLITUDE HE HAS FOUND ALL HE WANTS FOR THE REST OF HIS DAYS
4771-29403-0006 SHALL WE INTRODUCE OURSELVES IT WON'T BE EASY FOR ME TO SET THE EXAMPLE I USED THE PENCIL AGAIN WHY NOT BECAUSE YOU WILL EXPECT ME TO GIVE YOU MY NAME I CAN'T DO IT I HAVE CEASED TO BEAR MY FAMILY NAME
4771-29403-0007 AND BEING OUT OF SOCIETY WHAT NEED HAVE I FOR AN ASSUMED NAME AS FOR MY CHRISTIAN NAME IT'S SO DETESTABLY UGLY THAT I HATE THE SIGHT AND SOUND OF IT HERE THEY KNOW ME AS THE LODGER WILL YOU HAVE THAT
4771-29403-0008 CALL ME THE CUR OH YOU NEEDN'T START THAT'S AS ACCURATE A DESCRIPTION OF ME AS ANY OTHER WHAT'S YOUR NAME I WROTE IT FOR HIM HIS FACE DARKENED WHEN HE FOUND OUT WHO I WAS YOUNG PERSONALLY ATTRACTIVE AND A GREAT LANDOWNER HE SAID
4771-29403-0009 I SAW YOU JUST NOW TALKING FAMILIARLY WITH CRISTEL TOLLER I DIDN'T LIKE THAT AT THE TIME I LIKE IT LESS THAN EVER NOW MY PENCIL ASKED HIM WITHOUT CEREMONY WHAT HE MEANT HE WAS READY WITH HIS REPLY I MEAN THIS YOU OWE SOMETHING TO THE GOOD LUCK WHICH HAS PLACED YOU WHERE YOU ARE
4771-29403-0010 KEEP YOUR FAMILIARITY FOR LADIES IN YOUR OWN RANK OF LIFE THIS TO A YOUNG MAN LIKE ME WAS UNENDURABLE INSOLENCE I HAD HITHERTO REFRAINED FROM TAKING HIM AT HIS OWN BITTER WORD IN THE MATTER OF NICK NAME IN THE IRRITATION OF THE MOMENT I NOW FIRST RESOLVED TO ADOPT HIS SUGGESTION SERIOUSLY
4771-29403-0011 THE NEXT SLIP OF PAPER THAT I HANDED TO HIM ADMINISTERED THE SMARTEST REBUFF THAT MY DULL BRAINS COULD DISCOVER ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT THE CUR IS REQUESTED TO KEEP HIS ADVICE TILL HE IS ASKED FOR IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING LIKE A SMILE SHOWED ITSELF FAINTLY ON HIS LIPS
4771-29403-0012 AND REPRESENTED THE ONLY EFFECT WHICH MY SEVERITY HAD PRODUCED HE STILL FOLLOWED HIS OWN TRAIN OF THOUGHT AS RESOLUTELY AND AS IMPERTINENTLY AS EVER I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU TALKING TO CRISTEL BEFORE TO NIGHT HAVE YOU BEEN MEETING HER IN SECRET
4771-29403-0013 IN JUSTICE TO THE GIRL I FELT THAT I OUGHT TO SET HIM RIGHT SO FAR TAKING UP THE PENCIL AGAIN I TOLD THIS STRANGE MAN THAT I HAD JUST RETURNED TO ENGLAND AFTER AN ABSENCE OF MANY YEARS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT I HAD KNOWN CRISTEL WHEN WE WERE BOTH CHILDREN
4771-29403-0014 AND THAT I HAD MET HER PURELY BY ACCIDENT WHEN HE HAD DETECTED US TALKING OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE SEEING ME PAUSE AFTER ADVANCING TO THAT POINT IN THE WRITING OF MY REPLY HE HELD OUT HIS HAND IMPATIENTLY FOR THE PAPER I SIGNED HIM TO WAIT AND ADDED A LAST SENTENCE UNDERSTAND THIS
4771-29403-0015 I WILL ANSWER NO MORE QUESTIONS I HAVE DONE WITH THE SUBJECT HE READ WHAT I HAD WRITTEN WITH THE CLOSEST ATTENTION BUT HIS INVETERATE SUSPICION OF ME WAS NOT SET AT REST EVEN YET ARE YOU LIKELY TO COME THIS WAY AGAIN HE ASKED I POINTED TO THE FINAL LINES OF MY WRITING AND GOT UP TO GO
4771-29403-0016 THIS ASSERTION OF MY WILL AGAINST HIS ROUSED HIM HE STOPPED ME AT THE DOOR NOT BY A MOTION OF HIS HAND BUT BY THE MASTERY OF HIS LOOK THE DIM CANDLELIGHT AFFORDED ME NO HELP IN DETERMINING THE COLOR OF HIS EYES DARK LARGE AND FINELY SET IN HIS HEAD
4771-29403-0017 STILL AS MONOTONOUS AS EVER HIS VOICE IN SOME DEGREE EXPRESSED THE FRENZY THAT WAS IN HIM BY SUDDENLY RISING IN ITS PITCH WHEN HE SPOKE TO ME NEXT MISTER ROYLAKE I LOVE HER MISTER ROYLAKE I AM DETERMINED TO MARRY HER ANY MAN WHO COMES BETWEEN ME AND THAT CRUEL GIRL
4771-29403-0018 AH SHE'S AS HARD AS ONE OF HER FATHER'S MILLSTONES IT'S THE MISERY OF MY LIFE IT'S THE JOY OF MY LIFE TO LOVE HER I TELL YOU YOUNG SIR ANY MAN WHO COMES BETWEEN CRISTEL AND ME DOES IT AT HIS PERIL REMEMBER THAT I HAD NO WISH TO GIVE OFFENCE
4771-29403-0019 BUT HIS THREATENING ME IN THIS MANNER WAS SO ABSURD THAT I GAVE WAY TO THE IMPRESSION OF THE MOMENT AND LAUGHED HE STEPPED UP TO ME WITH SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF DEMONIACAL RAGE AND HATRED IN HIS FACE THAT HE BECAME ABSOLUTELY UGLY IN AN INSTANT I AMUSE YOU DO I HE SAID YOU DON'T KNOW THE MAN YOU'RE TRIFLING WITH
4771-29403-0020 YOU HAD BETTER KNOW ME YOU SHALL KNOW ME HE TURNED AWAY AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE WRETCHED LITTLE ROOM DEEP IN THOUGHT I DON'T WANT THIS MATTER BETWEEN US TO END BADLY HE SAID INTERRUPTING HIS MEDITATIONS THEN RETURNING TO THEM AGAIN AND THEN ONCE MORE ADDRESSING ME
4771-29403-0021 YOU'RE YOUNG YOU'RE THOUGHTLESS BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A BAD FELLOW I WONDER WHETHER I CAN TRUST YOU NOT ONE MAN IN A THOUSAND WOULD DO IT NEVER MIND I'M THE ONE MAN IN TEN THOUSAND WHO DOES IT MISTER GERARD ROYLAKE I'M GOING TO TRUST YOU
4771-29403-0022 WITH THIS INCOHERENT EXPRESSION OF A RESOLUTION UNKNOWN TO ME HE UNLOCKED A SHABBY TRUNK HIDDEN IN A CORNER
4771-29403-0023 MEN OF YOUR AGE HE RESUMED SELDOM LOOK BELOW THE SURFACE LEARN THAT VALUABLE HABIT SIR AND BEGIN BY LOOKING BELOW THE SURFACE OF ME HE FORCED THE PORTFOLIO INTO MY HAND ONCE MORE HIS BEAUTIFUL EYES HELD ME WITH THEIR IRRESISTIBLE INFLUENCE
4771-29403-0024 THEY LOOKED AT ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SAD AND SOLEMN WARNING DISCOVER FOR YOURSELF HE SAID WHAT DEVILS MY DEAFNESS HAS SET LOOSE IN ME AND LET NO EYES BUT YOURS SEE THAT HORRID SIGHT YOU WILL FIND ME HERE TOMORROW AND YOU WILL DECIDE BY THAT TIME WHETHER YOU MAKE AN ENEMY OF ME OR NOT
4771-29403-0025 WAS HE MAD I HESITATED TO ADOPT THAT CONCLUSION
4771-29403-0026 I MIGHT EVEN HAVE BEEN IN SOME DANGER OF ALLOWING HIM TO MAKE A FRIEND OF ME
4771-29403-0027 TO MY MIND ALTHOUGH I WAS FAR FROM FORESEEING THE CATASTROPHE THAT REALLY DID HAPPEN I FELT THAT I HAD RETURNED TO MY OWN COUNTRY AT A CRITICAL TIME IN THE LIFE OF THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER MY FRIENDLY INTERFERENCE MIGHT BE OF SERIOUS IMPORTANCE TO CRISTEL'S PEACE OF MIND PERHAPS EVEN TO HER PERSONAL SAFETY AS WELL
4771-29403-0028 EAGER TO DISCOVER WHAT THE CONTENTS OF THE PORTFOLIO MIGHT TELL ME I HURRIED BACK TO TRIMLEY DEEN MY STEPMOTHER HAD NOT YET RETURNED FROM THE DINNER PARTY AS ONE OF THE RESULTS OF MY TEN YEARS BANISHMENT FROM HOME
4771-29403-0029 THE WINDOWS LOOKED OUT ON A VIEW OF FORDWITCH WOOD
