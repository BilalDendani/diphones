7956-245687-0000 QUESTION SEVENTY SIX OF THE UNION OF BODY AND SOUL IN EIGHT ARTICLES
7956-245687-0001 WE NOW CONSIDER THE UNION OF THE SOUL WITH THE BODY AND CONCERNING THIS THERE ARE EIGHT POINTS OF INQUIRY ONE WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM TWO
7956-245687-0002 WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS MULTIPLIED NUMERICALLY ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF BODIES OR IS THERE ONE INTELLIGENCE FOR ALL MEN THREE WHETHER IN THE BODY THE FORM OF WHICH IS AN INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE THERE IS SOME OTHER SOUL FOUR
7956-245687-0003 WHETHER IN THE BODY THERE IS ANY OTHER SUBSTANTIAL FORM FIVE OF THE QUALITIES REQUIRED IN THE BODY OF WHICH THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS THE FORM SIX
7956-245687-0004 SEVEN WHETHER BY MEANS OF AN ACCIDENT EIGHT WHETHER THE SOUL IS WHOLLY IN EACH PART OF THE BODY
7956-245687-0005 WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM OBJECTION ONE IT SEEMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM FOR THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
7956-245687-0006 THAT THE INTELLECT IS SEPARATE AND THAT IT IS NOT THE ACT OF ANY BODY THEREFORE IT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
7956-245687-0007 FURTHER EVERY FORM IS DETERMINED ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS THE FORM OTHERWISE NO PROPORTION WOULD BE REQUIRED BETWEEN MATTER AND FORM THEREFORE IF THE INTELLECT WERE UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
7956-245687-0008 SINCE EVERY BODY HAS A DETERMINATE NATURE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT THE INTELLECT HAS A DETERMINATE NATURE AND THUS IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF KNOWING ALL THINGS AS IS CLEAR FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID
7956-245687-0009 TWO WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE NATURE OF THE INTELLECT THEREFORE THE INTELLECT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
7956-245687-0010 FURTHER WHATEVER RECEPTIVE POWER IS AN ACT OF A BODY RECEIVES A FORM MATERIALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY FOR WHAT IS RECEIVED MUST BE RECEIVED ACCORDING TO THE CONDITION OF THE RECEIVER
7956-245687-0011 BUT THE FORM OF THE THING UNDERSTOOD IS NOT RECEIVED INTO THE INTELLECT MATERIALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY BUT RATHER IMMATERIALLY AND UNIVERSALLY
7956-245687-0012 OTHERWISE THE INTELLECT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF IMMATERIAL AND UNIVERSAL OBJECTS BUT ONLY OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE THE SENSES THEREFORE THE INTELLECT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
7956-245687-0013 FURTHER POWER AND ACTION HAVE THE SAME SUBJECT FOR THE SAME SUBJECT IS WHAT CAN AND DOES ACT BUT THE INTELLECTUAL ACTION IS NOT THE ACTION OF A BODY AS APPEARS FROM ABOVE
7956-245687-0014 THEREFORE NEITHER IS THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTY A POWER OF THE BODY BUT VIRTUE OR POWER CANNOT BE MORE ABSTRACT OR MORE SIMPLE THAN THE ESSENCE FROM WHICH THE FACULTY OR POWER IS DERIVED THEREFORE NEITHER IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE INTELLECT THE FORM OF A BODY
7956-245687-0015 FURTHER WHATEVER HAS PER SE EXISTENCE IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM BECAUSE A FORM IS THAT BY WHICH A THING EXISTS SO THAT THE VERY EXISTENCE OF A FORM DOES NOT BELONG TO THE FORM BY ITSELF
7956-245687-0016 THEREFORE IT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
7956-245687-0017 FURTHER WHATEVER EXISTS IN A THING BY REASON OF ITS NATURE EXISTS IN IT ALWAYS BUT TO BE UNITED TO MATTER BELONGS TO THE FORM BY REASON OF ITS NATURE BECAUSE FORM IS THE ACT OF MATTER NOT BY AN ACCIDENTAL QUALITY
7956-245687-0018 BUT BY ITS OWN ESSENCE OTHERWISE MATTER AND FORM WOULD NOT MAKE A THING SUBSTANTIALLY ONE BUT ONLY ACCIDENTALLY ONE THEREFORE A FORM CANNOT BE WITHOUT ITS OWN PROPER MATTER BUT THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE SINCE IT IS INCORRUPTIBLE
7956-245687-0019 REMAINS SEPARATE FROM THE BODY AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODY THEREFORE THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM ON THE CONTRARY ACCORDING TO THE PHILOSOPHER
7956-245687-0020 DIFFERENCE IS DERIVED FROM THE FORM BUT THE DIFFERENCE WHICH CONSTITUTES MAN IS RATIONAL WHICH IS APPLIED TO MAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE THEREFORE THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS THE FORM OF MAN I ANSWER THAT
7956-245687-0021 WE MUST ASSERT THAT THE INTELLECT WHICH IS THE PRINCIPLE OF INTELLECTUAL OPERATION IS THE FORM OF THE HUMAN BODY FOR THAT WHEREBY PRIMARILY ANYTHING ACTS IS A FORM OF THE THING TO WHICH THE ACT IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED
7956-245687-0022 FOR INSTANCE THAT WHEREBY A BODY IS PRIMARILY HEALED IS HEALTH AND THAT WHEREBY THE SOUL KNOWS PRIMARILY IS KNOWLEDGE HENCE HEALTH IS A FORM OF THE BODY AND KNOWLEDGE IS A FORM OF THE SOUL
7956-245687-0023 THE REASON IS BECAUSE NOTHING ACTS EXCEPT SO FAR AS IT IS IN ACT WHEREFORE A THING ACTS BY THAT WHEREBY IT IS IN ACT NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FIRST THING BY WHICH THE BODY LIVES IS THE SOUL
7956-245687-0024 AND AS LIFE APPEARS THROUGH VARIOUS OPERATIONS IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF LIVING THINGS THAT WHEREBY WE PRIMARILY PERFORM EACH OF ALL THESE VITAL ACTIONS IS THE SOUL FOR THE SOUL IS THE PRIMARY PRINCIPLE OF OUR NOURISHMENT SENSATION AND LOCAL MOVEMENT
7956-245687-0025 AND LIKEWISE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING THEREFORE THIS PRINCIPLE BY WHICH WE PRIMARILY UNDERSTAND WHETHER IT BE CALLED THE INTELLECT OR THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS THE FORM OF THE BODY THIS IS THE DEMONSTRATION USED BY ARISTOTLE
7956-245687-0026 BUT IF ANYONE SAYS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS NOT THE FORM OF THE BODY HE MUST FIRST EXPLAIN HOW IT IS THAT THIS ACTION OF UNDERSTANDING IS THE ACTION OF THIS PARTICULAR MAN FOR EACH ONE IS CONSCIOUS THAT IT IS HIMSELF WHO UNDERSTANDS
7956-245687-0027 NOW AN ACTION MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANYONE IN THREE WAYS AS IS CLEAR FROM THE PHILOSOPHER
7956-245687-0028 FOR INSTANCE AS A PHYSICIAN HEALS OR BY VIRTUE OF A PART AS A MAN SEES BY HIS EYE OR THROUGH AN ACCIDENTAL QUALITY AS WHEN WE SAY THAT SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE BUILDS BECAUSE IT IS ACCIDENTAL TO THE BUILDER TO BE WHITE
7956-245687-0029 SO WHEN WE SAY THAT SOCRATES OR PLATO UNDERSTANDS IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO HIM ACCIDENTALLY SINCE IT IS ASCRIBED TO HIM AS MAN WHICH IS PREDICATED OF HIM ESSENTIALLY
7956-245687-0030 WE MUST THEREFORE SAY EITHER THAT SOCRATES UNDERSTANDS BY VIRTUE OF HIS WHOLE SELF AS PLATO MAINTAINED HOLDING THAT MAN IS AN INTELLECTUAL SOUL OR THAT INTELLIGENCE IS A PART OF SOCRATES THE FIRST CANNOT STAND AS WAS SHOWN ABOVE
7956-245687-0031 FOR THIS REASON THAT IT IS ONE AND THE SAME MAN WHO IS CONSCIOUS BOTH THAT HE UNDERSTANDS AND THAT HE SENSES BUT ONE CANNOT SENSE WITHOUT A BODY THEREFORE THE BODY MUST BE SOME PART OF MAN
7956-245687-0032 IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE INTELLECT BY WHICH SOCRATES UNDERSTANDS IS A PART OF SOCRATES SO THAT IN SOME WAY IT IS UNITED TO THE BODY OF SOCRATES
7956-245687-0033 THE COMMENTATOR HELD THAT THIS UNION IS THROUGH THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES AS HAVING A DOUBLE SUBJECT IN THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT AND IN THE PHANTASMS WHICH ARE IN THE CORPOREAL ORGANS
7956-245687-0034 THUS THROUGH THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT IS LINKED TO THE BODY OF THIS OR THAT PARTICULAR MAN BUT THIS LINK OR UNION DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT THE ACT OF THE INTELLECT IS THE ACT OF SOCRATES
7956-245687-0035 THIS CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN FROM COMPARISON WITH THE SENSITIVE FACULTY FROM WHICH ARISTOTLE PROCEEDS TO CONSIDER THINGS RELATING TO THE INTELLECT FOR THE RELATION OF PHANTASMS TO THE INTELLECT IS LIKE THE RELATION OF COLORS TO THE SENSE OF SIGHT
7956-245687-0036 THEREFORE AS THE SPECIES OF COLORS ARE IN THE SIGHT SO ARE THE SPECIES OF PHANTASMS IN THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT BECAUSE THE COLORS THE IMAGES OF WHICH ARE IN THE SIGHT ARE ON A WALL
7956-245687-0037 THE ACTION OF SEEING IS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO THE WALL FOR WE DO NOT SAY THAT THE WALL SEES BUT RATHER THAT IT IS SEEN THEREFORE FROM THE FACT THAT THE SPECIES OF PHANTASMS ARE IN THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT SOCRATES IN WHOM ARE THE PHANTASMS
7956-245687-0038 UNDERSTANDS BUT THAT HE OR HIS PHANTASMS ARE UNDERSTOOD SOME HOWEVER TRIED TO MAINTAIN THAT THE INTELLECT IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS MOTOR
7956-245687-0039 AND HENCE THAT THE INTELLECT AND BODY FORM ONE THING SO THAT THE ACT OF THE INTELLECT COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE WHOLE THIS IS HOWEVER ABSURD FOR MANY REASONS FIRST BECAUSE THE INTELLECT DOES NOT MOVE THE BODY EXCEPT THROUGH THE APPETITE
7956-245687-0040 THE MOVEMENT OF WHICH PRESUPPOSES THE OPERATION OF THE INTELLECT THE REASON THEREFORE WHY SOCRATES UNDERSTANDS IS NOT BECAUSE HE IS MOVED BY HIS INTELLECT BUT RATHER CONTRARIWISE HE IS MOVED BY HIS INTELLECT BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS
7956-245687-0041 SECONDLY BECAUSE SINCE SOCRATES IS AN INDIVIDUAL IN A NATURE OF ONE ESSENCE COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM IF THE INTELLECT BE NOT THE FORM IT FOLLOWS THAT IT MUST BE OUTSIDE THE ESSENCE AND THEN THE INTELLECT IS THE WHOLE SOCRATES AS A MOTOR TO THE THING MOVED
7956-245687-0042 WHEREAS THE ACT OF INTELLECT REMAINS IN THE AGENT AND DOES NOT PASS INTO SOMETHING ELSE AS DOES THE ACTION OF HEATING THEREFORE THE ACTION OF UNDERSTANDING CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO SOCRATES FOR THE REASON THAT HE IS MOVED BY HIS INTELLECT
7956-245687-0043 THIRDLY BECAUSE THE ACTION OF A MOTOR IS NEVER ATTRIBUTED TO THE THING MOVED EXCEPT AS TO AN INSTRUMENT AS THE ACTION OF A CARPENTER TO A SAW THEREFORE IF UNDERSTANDING IS ATTRIBUTED TO SOCRATES AS THE ACTION OF WHAT MOVES HIM
7956-245687-0044 IT FOLLOWS THAT IT IS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM AS TO AN INSTRUMENT THIS IS CONTRARY TO THE TEACHING OF THE PHILOSOPHER WHO HOLDS THAT UNDERSTANDING IS NOT POSSIBLE THROUGH A CORPOREAL INSTRUMENT
7956-245687-0045 THE SAME CAN BE CLEARLY SHOWN FROM THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN SPECIES FOR THE NATURE OF EACH THING IS SHOWN BY ITS OPERATION NOW THE PROPER OPERATION OF MAN AS MAN IS TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE HE THEREBY SURPASSES ALL OTHER ANIMALS
7956-245687-0046 WHENCE ARISTOTLE CONCLUDES
7956-245687-0047 THAT THE ULTIMATE HAPPINESS OF MAN MUST CONSIST IN THIS OPERATION AS PROPERLY BELONGING TO HIM MAN MUST THEREFORE DERIVE HIS SPECIES FROM THAT WHICH IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS OPERATION BUT THE SPECIES OF ANYTHING IS DERIVED FROM ITS FORM
7956-245687-0048 IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS THE PROPER FORM OF MAN BUT WE MUST OBSERVE THAT THE NOBLER A FORM IS THE MORE IT RISES ABOVE CORPOREAL MATTER
7956-245687-0049 THE LESS IT IS MERGED IN MATTER AND THE MORE IT EXCELS MATTER BY ITS POWER AND ITS OPERATION HENCE WE FIND THAT THE FORM OF A MIXED BODY HAS ANOTHER OPERATION NOT CAUSED BY ITS ELEMENTAL QUALITIES
7956-245687-0050 AND THE HIGHER WE ADVANCE IN THE NOBILITY OF FORMS THE MORE WE FIND THAT THE POWER OF THE FORM EXCELS THE ELEMENTARY MATTER AS THE VEGETATIVE SOUL EXCELS THE FORM OF THE METAL AND THE SENSITIVE SOUL EXCELS THE VEGETATIVE SOUL
7956-245687-0051 NOW THE HUMAN SOUL IS THE HIGHEST AND NOBLEST OF FORMS WHEREFORE IT EXCELS CORPOREAL MATTER IN ITS POWER BY THE FACT THAT IT HAS AN OPERATION AND A POWER IN WHICH CORPOREAL MATTER HAS NO SHARE WHATEVER
7956-245687-0052 THE SOUL COMMUNICATES THAT EXISTENCE IN WHICH IT SUBSISTS TO THE CORPOREAL MATTER OUT OF WHICH AND THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE RESULTS UNITY OF EXISTENCE SO THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE WHOLE COMPOSITE IS ALSO THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL
7956-245687-0053 THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH OTHER NON SUBSISTENT FORMS FOR THIS REASON THE HUMAN SOUL RETAINS ITS OWN EXISTENCE AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODY WHEREAS IT IS NOT SO WITH OTHER FORMS
7956-245687-0054 AS IT BELONGS TO A LIGHT BODY BY REASON OF ITSELF TO BE RAISED UP AND AS A LIGHT BODY REMAINS LIGHT WHEN REMOVED FROM ITS PROPER PLACE RETAINING MEANWHILE AN APTITUDE AND AN INCLINATION FOR ITS PROPER PLACE
7956-245687-0055 SO THE HUMAN SOUL RETAINS ITS PROPER EXISTENCE WHEN SEPARATED FROM THE BODY HAVING AN APTITUDE AND A NATURAL INCLINATION TO BE UNITED TO THE BODY
7956-245687-0056 EVERYTHING HAS UNITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT HAS BEING CONSEQUENTLY WE MUST JUDGE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF A THING AS WE JUDGE OF ITS BEING NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL BY VIRTUE OF ITS VERY BEING IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
7956-245687-0057 YET AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODY THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL RETAINS ITS OWN BEING IN LIKE MANNER THE MULTIPLICITY OF SOULS IS IN PROPORTION TO THE MULTIPLICITY OF THE BODIES YET AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODIES THE SOULS RETAIN THEIR MULTIPLIED BEING
7956-245687-0058 INDIVIDUALITY OF THE INTELLIGENT BEING OR OF THE SPECIES WHEREBY IT UNDERSTANDS DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE UNDERSTANDING OF UNIVERSALS OTHERWISE SINCE SEPARATE INTELLECTS ARE SUBSISTENT SUBSTANCES
7956-245687-0059 AND CONSEQUENTLY INDIVIDUAL THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND UNIVERSALS BUT THE MATERIALITY OF THE KNOWER AND OF THE SPECIES WHEREBY IT KNOWS IMPEDES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSAL
7956-245687-0060 FOR AS EVERY ACTION IS ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF THE FORM BY WHICH THE AGENT ACTS AS HEATING IS ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF THE HEAT SO KNOWLEDGE IS ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF THE SPECIES BY WHICH THE KNOWER KNOWS
7956-245687-0061 THEREFORE IF THE FORM WHICH IS THE MEANS OF KNOWLEDGE IS MATERIAL THAT IS NOT ABSTRACTED FROM MATERIAL CONDITIONS ITS LIKENESS TO THE NATURE OF A SPECIES OR GENUS WILL BE ACCORDING TO THE DISTINCTION AND MULTIPLICATION OF THAT NATURE
7956-245687-0062 BY MEANS OF INDIVIDUATING PRINCIPLES SO THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF A THING IN GENERAL WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT IF THE SPECIES BE ABSTRACTED FROM THE CONDITIONS OF INDIVIDUAL MATTER
7956-245687-0063 THERE WILL BE A LIKENESS OF THE NATURE WITHOUT THOSE THINGS WHICH MAKE IT DISTINCT AND MULTIPLIED THUS THERE WILL BE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSAL NOR DOES IT MATTER AS TO THIS PARTICULAR POINT
7956-245687-0064 BECAUSE EVEN IF THERE WERE BUT ONE IT WOULD NECESSARILY BE AN INDIVIDUAL INTELLECT AND THE SPECIES WHEREBY IT UNDERSTANDS AN INDIVIDUAL SPECIES
7956-245687-0065 WHETHER THE INTELLECT BE ONE OR MANY WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD IS ONE FOR WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD IS IN THE INTELLECT NOT ACCORDING TO ITS OWN NATURE BUT ACCORDING TO ITS LIKENESS FOR THE STONE IS NOT IN THE SOUL BUT ITS LIKENESS IS
7956-245687-0066 YET IT IS THE STONE WHICH IS UNDERSTOOD NOT THE LIKENESS OF THE STONE
7956-245687-0067 OTHERWISE THE OBJECTS OF SCIENCES WOULD NOT BE THINGS BUT ONLY INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES NOW IT HAPPENS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT FORMS ARE LIKENED TO THE SAME THING
7956-245687-0068 AND SINCE KNOWLEDGE IS BEGOTTEN ACCORDING TO THE ASSIMILATION OF THE KNOWER TO THE THING KNOWN IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SAME THING MAY HAPPEN TO BE KNOWN BY SEVERAL KNOWERS AS IS APPARENT IN REGARD TO THE SENSES FOR SEVERAL SEE THE SAME COLOR
7956-245687-0069 ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT LIKENESSES IN THE SAME WAY SEVERAL INTELLECTS UNDERSTAND ONE OBJECT UNDERSTOOD BUT THERE IS THIS DIFFERENCE ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF ARISTOTLE BETWEEN THE SENSE AND THE INTELLIGENCE
7956-245687-0070 THAT A THING IS PERCEIVED BY THE SENSE ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION WHICH IT HAS OUTSIDE THE SOUL THAT IS IN ITS INDIVIDUALITY
7956-245687-0071 WHEREAS THE NATURE OF THE THING UNDERSTOOD IS INDEED OUTSIDE THE SOUL BUT THE MODE ACCORDING TO WHICH IT EXISTS OUTSIDE THE SOUL IS NOT THE MODE ACCORDING TO WHICH IT IS UNDERSTOOD FOR THE COMMON NATURE IS UNDERSTOOD AS APART FROM THE INDIVIDUATING PRINCIPLES
7956-245687-0072 WHEREAS SUCH IS NOT ITS MODE OF EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THE SOUL BUT ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF PLATO THE THING UNDERSTOOD EXISTS OUTSIDE THE SOUL IN THE SAME CONDITION AS THOSE UNDER WHICH IT IS UNDERSTOOD FOR HE SUPPOSED THAT THE NATURES OF THINGS EXIST SEPARATE FROM MATTER
7956-245687-0073 ONE KNOWLEDGE EXISTS IN THE DISCIPLE AND ANOTHER IN THE MASTER HOW IT IS CAUSED WILL BE SHOWN LATER ON
7956-245687-0074 AUGUSTINE DENIES A PLURALITY OF SOULS THAT WOULD INVOLVE A PLURALITY OF SPECIES
7956-245687-0075 WHETHER BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN OTHER SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN OTHER SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER
7956-245687-0076 SUCH AS THE SENSITIVE SOUL AND THE NUTRITIVE SOUL FOR CORRUPTIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE ARE NOT OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE BUT THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS INCORRUPTIBLE WHEREAS THE OTHER SOULS AS THE SENSITIVE AND THE NUTRITIVE
7956-245687-0077 ARE CORRUPTIBLE AS WAS SHOWN ABOVE QUESTION SEVENTY FIVE A SIX THEREFORE IN MAN THE ESSENCE OF THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THE SENSITIVE SOUL AND THE NUTRITIVE SOUL CANNOT BE THE SAME
7956-245687-0078 FURTHER IF IT BE SAID THAT THE SENSITIVE SOUL IN MAN IS INCORRUPTIBLE ON THE CONTRARY CORRUPTIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE DIFFER GENERICALLY SAYS THE PHILOSOPHER
7956-245687-0079 BUT THE SENSITIVE SOUL IN THE HORSE THE LION AND OTHER BRUTE ANIMALS IS CORRUPTIBLE IF THEREFORE IN MAN IT BE INCORRUPTIBLE
7956-245687-0080 THE SENSITIVE SOUL IN MAN AND BRUTE ANIMALS WILL NOT BE OF THE SAME GENUS NOW AN ANIMAL IS SO CALLED FROM ITS HAVING A SENSITIVE SOUL AND THEREFORE ANIMAL WILL NOT BE ONE GENUS COMMON TO MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS WHICH IS ABSURD
7956-245687-0081 THAT THE GENUS IS TAKEN FROM THE MATTER AND DIFFERENCE FROM THE FORM BUT RATIONAL WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE CONSTITUTING MAN IS TAKEN FROM THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL WHILE HE IS CALLED ANIMAL BY REASON OF HIS HAVING A BODY ANIMATED BY A SENSITIVE SOUL
7956-245687-0082 THEREFORE THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL MAY BE COMPARED TO THE BODY ANIMATED BY A SENSITIVE SOUL AS FORM TO MATTER THEREFORE IN MAN THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS NOT ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THE SENSITIVE SOUL
7956-245687-0083 BY ONE FORM THE VEGETATIVE SOUL AND ANIMAL BY ANOTHER FORM THE SENSITIVE SOUL AND MAN BY ANOTHER FORM THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT MAN IS NOT ABSOLUTELY ONE
7956-245687-0084 THEN A BIPED ANIMAL IS NOT ABSOLUTELY ONE FOR THIS REASON AGAINST THOSE WHO HOLD THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL SOULS IN THE BODY
7956-245687-0085 WHAT CONTAINS THEM THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM ONE IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THEY ARE UNITED BY THE ONE BODY BECAUSE RATHER DOES THE SOUL CONTAIN THE BODY AND MAKE IT ONE THAN THE REVERSE
7956-245687-0086 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BY THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE THING IS PREDICATED OF ANOTHER
7956-245687-0087 EITHER ACCIDENTALLY IF THE FORMS ARE NOT ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER AS WHEN WE SAY THAT SOMETHING WHITE IS SWEET OR ESSENTIALLY IN THE SECOND MANNER OF ESSENTIAL PREDICATION IF THE FORMS ARE ORDERED ONE TO ANOTHER
7956-245687-0088 THE SUBJECT BELONGING TO THE DEFINITION OF THE PREDICATE AS A SURFACE IS PRESUPPOSED TO COLOR SO THAT IF WE SAY THAT A BODY WITH A SURFACE IS COLORED WE HAVE THE SECOND MANNER OF ESSENTIAL PREDICATION
7956-245687-0089 THEREFORE IF WE HAVE ONE FORM BY WHICH A THING IS AN ANIMAL AND ANOTHER FORM BY WHICH IT IS A MAN IT FOLLOWS EITHER THAT ONE OF THESE TWO THINGS COULD NOT BE PREDICATED OF THE OTHER EXCEPT ACCIDENTALLY
7956-245687-0090 SUPPOSING THESE TWO FORMS NOT TO BE ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER OR THAT ONE WOULD BE PREDICATED OF THE OTHER ACCORDING TO THE SECOND MANNER OF ESSENTIAL PREDICATION IF ONE SOUL BE PRESUPPOSED TO THE OTHER BUT BOTH OF THESE CONSEQUENCES ARE CLEARLY FALSE
7956-245687-0091 BECAUSE ANIMAL IS PREDICATED OF MAN ESSENTIALLY AND NOT ACCIDENTALLY AND MAN IS NOT PART OF THE DEFINITION OF AN ANIMAL BUT THE OTHER WAY ABOUT THEREFORE OF NECESSITY BY THE SAME FORM A THING IS ANIMAL AND MAN
7956-245687-0092 OTHERWISE MAN WOULD NOT REALLY BE THE THING WHICH IS AN ANIMAL SO THAT ANIMAL CAN BE ESSENTIALLY PREDICATED OF MAN THIRDLY THIS IS SHOWN TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BY THE FACT THAT WHEN ONE OPERATION OF THE SOUL IS INTENSE IT IMPEDES ANOTHER
7956-245687-0093 WHICH COULD NEVER BE THE CASE UNLESS THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTION WERE ESSENTIALLY ONE WE MUST THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT IN MAN THE SENSITIVE SOUL THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL AND THE NUTRITIVE SOUL ARE NUMERICALLY ONE SOUL
7956-245687-0094 THIS CAN EASILY BE EXPLAINED IF WE CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCES OF SPECIES AND FORMS FOR WE OBSERVE THAT THE SPECIES AND FORMS OF THINGS DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER AS THE PERFECT AND IMPERFECT
7956-245687-0095 AS IN THE ORDER OF THINGS THE ANIMATE ARE MORE PERFECT THAN THE INANIMATE AND ANIMALS MORE PERFECT THAN PLANTS AND MAN THAN BRUTE ANIMALS AND IN EACH OF THESE GENERA THERE ARE VARIOUS DEGREES FOR THIS REASON ARISTOTLE
7956-245687-0096 ONE OF WHICH CONTAINS ANOTHER AS A PENTAGON CONTAINS AND EXCEEDS A TETRAGON THUS THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL CONTAINS VIRTUALLY WHATEVER BELONGS TO THE SENSITIVE SOUL OF BRUTE ANIMALS
7956-245687-0097 AND TO THE NUTRITIVE SOULS OF PLANTS THEREFORE AS A SURFACE WHICH IS OF A PENTAGONAL SHAPE IS NOT TETRAGONAL BY ONE SHAPE AND PENTAGONAL BY ANOTHER SINCE A TETRAGONAL SHAPE WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS AS CONTAINED IN THE PENTAGONAL
7956-245687-0098 AND ANIMAL BY ANOTHER BUT BY ONE AND THE SAME SOUL HE IS BOTH ANIMAL AND MAN
