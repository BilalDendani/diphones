6555-397-0000 MAY YET BE AT BOTTOM HYPOTHETICAL FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE PRECEPT IS THOU SHALT NOT PROMISE DECEITFULLY AND IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE NECESSITY OF THIS IS NOT A MERE COUNSEL TO AVOID SOME OTHER EVIL SO THAT IT SHOULD MEAN
6555-397-0001 THEN WE CANNOT SHOW WITH CERTAINTY IN ANY EXAMPLE THAT THE WILL WAS DETERMINED MERELY BY THE LAW WITHOUT ANY OTHER SPRING OF ACTION ALTHOUGH IT MAY APPEAR TO BE SO FOR IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE THAT FEAR OF DISGRACE
6555-397-0002 BUT IN SUCH A CASE THE SO CALLED MORAL IMPERATIVE WHICH AS SUCH APPEARS TO BE CATEGORICAL AND UNCONDITIONAL WOULD IN REALITY BE ONLY A PRAGMATIC PRECEPT DRAWING OUR ATTENTION TO OUR OWN INTERESTS AND MERELY TEACHING US TO TAKE THESE INTO CONSIDERATION
6555-397-0003 THE POSSIBILITY OF A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE AS WE HAVE NOT IN THIS CASE THE ADVANTAGE OF ITS REALITY BEING GIVEN IN EXPERIENCE SO THAT THE ELUCIDATION OF ITS POSSIBILITY SHOULD BE REQUISITE ONLY FOR ITS EXPLANATION
6555-397-0004 NOT FOR ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN THE MEANTIME IT MAY BE DISCERNED BEFOREHAND THAT THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE ALONE HAS THE PURPORT OF A PRACTICAL LAW ALL THE REST MAY INDEED BE CALLED PRINCIPLES OF THE WILL BUT NOT LAWS
6555-397-0005 SINCE WHATEVER IS ONLY NECESSARY FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF SOME ARBITRARY PURPOSE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS IN ITSELF CONTINGENT AND WE CAN AT ANY TIME BE FREE FROM THE PRECEPT IF WE GIVE UP THE PURPOSE ON THE CONTRARY
6555-397-0006 THE DIFFICULTY OF DISCERNING ITS POSSIBILITY IS A VERY PROFOUND ONE
6555-397-0007 I CONNECT THE ACT WITH THE WILL WITHOUT PRESUPPOSING ANY CONDITION RESULTING FROM ANY INCLINATION
6555-397-0008 AND THEREFORE NECESSARILY THOUGH ONLY OBJECTIVELY
6555-397-0009 THIS IS ACCORDINGLY A PRACTICAL PROPOSITION WHICH DOES NOT DEDUCE THE WILLING OF AN ACTION BY MERE ANALYSIS FROM ANOTHER ALREADY PRESUPPOSED FOR WE HAVE NOT SUCH A PERFECT WILL BUT CONNECTS IT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE CONCEPTION OF THE WILL OF A RATIONAL BEING
6555-397-0010 IN THIS PROBLEM WE WILL FIRST INQUIRE WHETHER THE MERE CONCEPTION OF A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE MAY NOT PERHAPS SUPPLY US ALSO WITH THE FORMULA OF IT CONTAINING THE PROPOSITION WHICH ALONE CAN BE A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE
6555-397-0011 FOR EVEN IF WE KNOW THE TENOR OF SUCH AN ABSOLUTE COMMAND
6555-397-0012 WHICH WE POSTPONE TO THE LAST SECTION WHEN I CONCEIVE A HYPOTHETICAL IMPERATIVE IN GENERAL I DO NOT KNOW BEFOREHAND WHAT IT WILL CONTAIN UNTIL I AM GIVEN THE CONDITION BUT WHEN I CONCEIVE A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE
6555-397-0013 I KNOW AT ONCE WHAT IT CONTAINS FOR AS THE IMPERATIVE CONTAINS BESIDES THE LAW ONLY THE NECESSITY THAT THE MAXIMS SHALL CONFORM TO THIS LAW WHILE THE LAW CONTAINS NO CONDITIONS RESTRICTING IT THERE REMAINS NOTHING BUT THE GENERAL STATEMENT
6555-397-0014 THAT THE MAXIM OF THE ACTION SHOULD CONFORM TO A UNIVERSAL LAW AND IT IS THIS CONFORMITY ALONE THAT THE IMPERATIVE PROPERLY REPRESENTS AS NECESSARY
6555-397-0015 BY MEANS OF THE VERY FEELING WHOSE SPECIAL NATURE IT IS TO IMPEL TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIFE WOULD CONTRADICT ITSELF AND THEREFORE COULD NOT EXIST AS A SYSTEM OF NATURE HENCE
6555-397-0016 THAT MAXIM CANNOT POSSIBLY EXIST AS A UNIVERSAL LAW OF NATURE AND CONSEQUENTLY WOULD BE WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUPREME PRINCIPLE OF ALL DUTY
6555-397-0017 NOW THIS PRINCIPLE OF SELF LOVE OR OF ONE'S OWN ADVANTAGE MAY PERHAPS BE CONSISTENT WITH MY WHOLE FUTURE WELFARE BUT THE QUESTION NOW IS IS IT RIGHT
6555-397-0018 AND STATE THE QUESTION THUS HOW WOULD IT BE IF MY MAXIM WERE A UNIVERSAL LAW THEN I SEE AT ONCE THAT IT COULD NEVER HOLD AS A UNIVERSAL LAW OF NATURE BUT WOULD NECESSARILY CONTRADICT ITSELF
6555-397-0019 FOR SUPPOSING IT TO BE A UNIVERSAL LAW THAT EVERYONE WHEN HE THINKS HIMSELF IN A DIFFICULTY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROMISE WHATEVER HE PLEASES WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT KEEPING HIS PROMISE
6555-397-0020 A THIRD FINDS IN HIMSELF A TALENT WHICH WITH THE HELP OF SOME CULTURE MIGHT MAKE HIM A USEFUL MAN IN MANY RESPECTS BUT HE FINDS HIMSELF IN COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND PREFERS TO INDULGE IN PLEASURE RATHER THAN TO TAKE PAINS IN ENLARGING
6555-397-0021 AND IMPROVING HIS HAPPY NATURAL CAPACITIES HE ASKS HOWEVER WHETHER HIS MAXIM OF NEGLECT OF HIS NATURAL GIFTS BESIDES AGREEING WITH HIS INCLINATION TO INDULGENCE AGREES ALSO WITH WHAT IS CALLED DUTY
6555-397-0022 HE SEES THEN THAT A SYSTEM OF NATURE COULD INDEED SUBSIST WITH SUCH A UNIVERSAL LAW ALTHOUGH MEN
6555-397-0023 SHOULD LET THEIR TALENTS REST AND RESOLVE TO DEVOTE THEIR LIVES MERELY TO IDLENESS AMUSEMENT AND PROPAGATION OF THEIR SPECIES IN A WORD TO ENJOYMENT
