5893-1312-0000 JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET THREE WEEKS HAD PASSED SINCE JEFFERSON HOPE AND HIS COMRADES HAD DEPARTED FROM SALT LAKE CITY JOHN FERRIER'S HEART WAS SORE WITHIN HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN'S RETURN AND OF THE IMPENDING LOSS OF HIS ADOPTED CHILD
5893-1312-0001 YET HER BRIGHT AND HAPPY FACE RECONCILED HIM TO THE ARRANGEMENT MORE THAN ANY ARGUMENT COULD HAVE DONE HE HAD ALWAYS DETERMINED DEEP DOWN IN HIS RESOLUTE HEART
5893-1312-0002 SUCH A MARRIAGE HE REGARDED AS NO MARRIAGE AT ALL BUT AS A SHAME AND A DISGRACE WHATEVER HE MIGHT THINK OF THE MORMON DOCTRINES UPON THAT ONE POINT HE WAS INFLEXIBLE
5893-1312-0003 HE HAD TO SEAL HIS MOUTH ON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER FOR TO EXPRESS AN UNORTHODOX OPINION WAS A DANGEROUS MATTER IN THOSE DAYS IN THE LAND OF THE SAINTS YES A DANGEROUS MATTER SO DANGEROUS THAT EVEN THE MOST SAINTLY DARED ONLY WHISPER THEIR RELIGIOUS OPINIONS WITH BATED BREATH
5893-1312-0004 LEST SOMETHING WHICH FELL FROM THEIR LIPS MIGHT BE MISCONSTRUED AND BRING DOWN A SWIFT RETRIBUTION UPON THEM THE VICTIMS OF PERSECUTION HAD NOW TURNED PERSECUTORS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AND PERSECUTORS OF THE MOST TERRIBLE DESCRIPTION NOT THE INQUISITION OF SEVILLE NOR THE GERMAN VEHM GERICHT
5893-1312-0005 NOR THE SECRET SOCIETIES OF ITALY WERE EVER ABLE TO PUT A MORE FORMIDABLE MACHINERY IN MOTION THAN THAT WHICH CAST A CLOUD OVER THE STATE OF UTAH ITS INVISIBILITY AND THE MYSTERY WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO IT MADE THIS ORGANIZATION DOUBLY TERRIBLE IT APPEARED TO BE OMNISCIENT AND OMNIPOTENT
5893-1312-0006 AND YET WAS NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD THE MAN WHO HELD OUT AGAINST THE CHURCH VANISHED AWAY AND NONE KNEW WHITHER HE HAD GONE OR WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN AWAITED HIM AT HOME BUT NO FATHER EVER RETURNED TO TELL THEM HOW HE HAD FARED AT THE HANDS OF HIS SECRET JUDGES
5893-1312-0007 A RASH WORD OR A HASTY ACT WAS FOLLOWED BY ANNIHILATION AND YET NONE KNEW WHAT THE NATURE MIGHT BE OF THIS TERRIBLE POWER WHICH WAS SUSPENDED OVER THEM NO WONDER THAT MEN WENT ABOUT IN FEAR AND TREMBLING AND THAT EVEN IN THE HEART OF THE WILDERNESS THEY DARED NOT WHISPER THE DOUBTS WHICH OPPRESSED THEM
5893-1312-0008 WISHED AFTERWARDS TO PERVERT OR TO ABANDON IT SOON HOWEVER IT TOOK A WIDER RANGE THE SUPPLY OF ADULT WOMEN WAS RUNNING SHORT AND POLYGAMY WITHOUT A FEMALE POPULATION ON WHICH TO DRAW WAS A BARREN DOCTRINE INDEED
5893-1312-0009 RUMOURS OF MURDERED IMMIGRANTS AND RIFLED CAMPS IN REGIONS WHERE INDIANS HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN FRESH WOMEN APPEARED IN THE HAREMS OF THE ELDERS WOMEN WHO PINED AND WEPT AND BORE UPON THEIR FACES THE TRACES OF AN UNEXTINGUISHABLE HORROR
5893-1312-0010 BELATED WANDERERS UPON THE MOUNTAINS SPOKE OF GANGS OF ARMED MEN MASKED STEALTHY AND NOISELESS WHO FLITTED BY THEM IN THE DARKNESS THESE TALES AND RUMOURS TOOK SUBSTANCE AND SHAPE AND WERE CORROBORATED AND RE CORROBORATED UNTIL THEY RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO A DEFINITE NAME
5893-1312-0011 TO THIS DAY IN THE LONELY RANCHES OF THE WEST THE NAME OF THE DANITE BAND OR THE AVENGING ANGELS IS A SINISTER AND AN ILL OMENED ONE FULLER KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORGANIZATION WHICH PRODUCED SUCH TERRIBLE RESULTS SERVED TO INCREASE RATHER THAN TO LESSEN THE HORROR WHICH IT INSPIRED IN THE MINDS OF MEN
5893-1312-0012 NONE KNEW WHO BELONGED TO THIS RUTHLESS SOCIETY THE NAMES OF THE PARTICIPATORS IN THE DEEDS OF BLOOD AND VIOLENCE DONE UNDER THE NAME OF RELIGION WERE KEPT PROFOUNDLY SECRET THE VERY FRIEND TO WHOM YOU COMMUNICATED YOUR MISGIVINGS AS TO THE PROPHET AND HIS MISSION
5893-1312-0013 MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE WHO WOULD COME FORTH AT NIGHT WITH FIRE AND SWORD TO EXACT A TERRIBLE REPARATION HENCE EVERY MAN FEARED HIS NEIGHBOUR AND NONE SPOKE OF THE THINGS WHICH WERE NEAREST HIS HEART ONE FINE MORNING JOHN FERRIER WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO HIS WHEATFIELDS
5893-1312-0014 WHEN HE HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LATCH AND LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW SAW A STOUT SANDY HAIRED MIDDLE AGED MAN COMING UP THE PATHWAY HIS HEART LEAPT TO HIS MOUTH FOR THIS WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE GREAT BRIGHAM YOUNG HIMSELF FULL OF TREPIDATION FOR HE KNEW THAT SUCH A VISIT BODED HIM LITTLE GOOD
5893-1312-0015 FERRIER RAN TO THE DOOR TO GREET THE MORMON CHIEF THE LATTER HOWEVER RECEIVED HIS SALUTATIONS COLDLY AND FOLLOWED HIM WITH A STERN FACE INTO THE SITTING ROOM BROTHER FERRIER HE SAID TAKING A SEAT AND EYEING THE FARMER KEENLY FROM UNDER HIS LIGHT COLOURED EYELASHES

5893-1312-0024 HE WAS STILL SITTING WITH HIS ELBOWS UPON HIS KNEES CONSIDERING HOW HE SHOULD BROACH THE MATTER TO HIS DAUGHTER WHEN A SOFT HAND WAS LAID UPON HIS AND LOOKING UP HE SAW HER STANDING BESIDE HIM ONE GLANCE AT HER PALE FRIGHTENED FACE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE HAD HEARD WHAT HAD PASSED
