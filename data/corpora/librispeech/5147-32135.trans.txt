5147-32135-0000 THE CENTRAL AMERICAN AND MEXICAN COLONIES THE WESTERN SHORES OF ATLANTIS WERE NOT FAR DISTANT FROM THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS A PEOPLE POSSESSED OF SHIPS COULD READILY PASS FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND UNTIL THEY REACHED THE CONTINENT
5147-32135-0001 COLUMBUS FOUND THE NATIVES MAKING SUCH VOYAGES IN OPEN CANOES IF THEN WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS NO ORIGINAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INHABITANTS OF THE MAIN LAND AND OF ATLANTIS THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY OF THE ATLANTEANS WOULD SOON REVEAL TO THEM THE SHORES OF THE GULF
5147-32135-0002 COMMERCE IMPLIES THE PLANTATION OF COLONIES THE TRADING POST IS ALWAYS THE NUCLEUS OF A SETTLEMENT
5147-32135-0003 AND THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY WE CAN THEREFORE READILY BELIEVE THAT COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN ATLANTIS AND YUCATAN HONDURAS AND MEXICO CREATED COLONIES ALONG THE SHORES OF THE GULF WHICH GRADUALLY SPREAD INTO THE INTERIOR
5147-32135-0004 AND TO THE HIGH TABLE LANDS OF MEXICO AND ACCORDINGLY WE FIND AS I HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THAT ALL THE TRADITIONS OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICO POINT TO SOME COUNTRY IN THE EAST AND BEYOND THE SEA AS THE SOURCE OF THEIR FIRST CIVILIZED PEOPLE
5147-32135-0005 AND THIS REGION KNOWN AMONG THEM AS AZTLAN LIVED IN THE MEMORY OF THE PEOPLE AS A BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY LAND WHERE THEIR ANCESTORS HAD DWELT IN PEACE FOR MANY GENERATIONS
5147-32135-0006 ONE THIRD OF THIS TONGUE THE MAYA IS PURE GREEK WHO BROUGHT THE DIALECT OF HOMER TO AMERICA OR WHO TOOK TO GREECE THAT OF THE MAYAS GREEK IS THE OFFSPRING OF THE SANSCRIT IS MAYA OR ARE THEY COEVAL
5147-32135-0007 HIGHER EVEN THAN THAT OF EUROPE IN THE TIME OF COLUMBUS THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION AND IT IS ALSO PROBABLE AS I HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ORIGINALLY BELONGED TO THE WHITE RACE
5147-32135-0008 THE TOLTECS WERE FAIR ROBUST AND BEARDED I HAVE OFTEN SEEN INDIANS OF PURE BLOOD WITH BLUE EYES
5147-32135-0009 AT TEOTIHUACAN
5147-32135-0010 THE CITY IS INDEED OF VAST EXTENT
5147-32135-0011 RUINS WHICH AT FIRST MAKE NO IMPRESSION SO COMPLETE IS THEIR DILAPIDATION HE ASSERTS THE GREAT ANTIQUITY OF THESE RUINS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE VERY HIGHWAYS OF THE ANCIENT CITY TO BE COMPOSED OF BROKEN BRICKS AND POTTERY THE DEBRIS LEFT BY EARLIER POPULATIONS
5147-32135-0012 THIS CONTINENT HE SAYS PAGE FORTY THREE IS THE LAND OF MYSTERIES WE HERE ENTER AN INFINITY WHOSE LIMITS WE CANNOT ESTIMATE I SHALL SOON HAVE TO QUIT WORK IN THIS PLACE THE LONG AVENUE ON WHICH IT STANDS IS LINED WITH RUINS OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND PALACES
5147-32135-0013 FORMING CONTINUOUS LINES AS IN THE STREETS OF MODERN CITIES STILL ALL THESE EDIFICES AND HALLS WERE AS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE VAST SUBSTRUCTURES WHICH STRENGTHENED THEIR FOUNDATIONS WE FIND THE STRONGEST RESEMBLANCES TO THE WORKS OF THE ANCIENT EUROPEAN RACES
5147-32135-0014 THE MASONRY IS SIMILAR THE CEMENT IS THE SAME THE SCULPTURES ARE ALIKE BOTH PEOPLES USED THE ARCH IN BOTH CONTINENTS WE FIND BRICKS GLASSWARE AND EVEN PORCELAIN
5147-32135-0015 WITH BLUE FIGURES ON A WHITE GROUND ALSO BRONZE COMPOSED OF THE SAME ELEMENTS OF COPPER AND TIN IN LIKE PROPORTIONS COINS MADE OF COPPER ROUND AND T SHAPED AND EVEN METALLIC CANDLESTICKS
5147-32135-0016 IN A FOSSIL STATE INDICATING AN IMMENSE ANTIQUITY THE TOLTECS POSSESSED A PURE AND SIMPLE RELIGION LIKE THAT OF ATLANTIS AS DESCRIBED BY PLATO WITH THE SAME SACRIFICES OF FRUITS AND FLOWERS THEY WERE FARMERS THEY RAISED AND WOVE COTTON
5147-32135-0017 THEY CULTIVATED FRUITS THEY USED THE SIGN OF THE CROSS EXTENSIVELY THEY CUT AND ENGRAVED PRECIOUS STONES AMONG THEIR CARVINGS HAVE BEEN FOUND REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ELEPHANT AND THE LION BOTH ANIMALS NOT KNOWN IN AMERICA THE FORMS OF SEPULTURE
5147-32135-0018 WERE THE SAME AS AMONG THE ANCIENT RACES OF THE OLD WORLD THEY BURNT THE BODIES OF THEIR GREAT MEN AND ENCLOSED THE DUST IN FUNERAL URNS SOME OF THEIR DEAD WERE BURIED IN A SITTING POSITION OTHERS RECLINED AT FULL LENGTH AND MANY WERE EMBALMED LIKE THE EGYPTIAN MUMMIES
5147-32135-0019 WHEN WE TURN TO MEXICO THE SAME RESEMBLANCES PRESENT THEMSELVES THE GOVERNMENT WAS AN ELECTIVE MONARCHY LIKE THAT OF POLAND THE KING BEING SELECTED FROM THE ROYAL FAMILY BY THE VOTES OF THE NOBLES OF THE KINGDOM THERE WAS A ROYAL FAMILY AN ARISTOCRACY
5147-32135-0020 A PRIVILEGED PRIESTHOOD A JUDICIARY AND A COMMON PEOPLE HERE WE HAVE ALL THE SEVERAL ESTATES INTO WHICH SOCIETY IN EUROPE IS DIVIDED THERE WERE THIRTY GRAND NOBLES IN THE KINGDOM
5147-32135-0021 AND THE VASTNESS OF THE REALM MAY BE JUDGED BY THE FACT THAT EACH OF THESE COULD MUSTER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VASSALS FROM THEIR OWN ESTATES OR A TOTAL OF THREE MILLIONS AND WE HAVE ONLY TO READ OF THE VAST HORDES BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD AGAINST CORTEZ TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS NOT AN EXAGGERATION
5147-32135-0022 THE JUDGES WERE INDEPENDENT EVEN OF THE KING AND HELD THEIR OFFICES FOR LIFE THERE WERE SUPREME JUDGES FOR THE LARGER DIVISIONS OF THE KINGDOM DISTRICT JUDGES IN EACH OF THE PROVINCES AND MAGISTRATES CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
5147-32135-0023 THERE WAS ALSO A GENERAL LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY CONGRESS OR PARLIAMENT HELD EVERY EIGHTY DAYS PRESIDED OVER BY THE KING CONSISTING OF ALL THE JUDGES OF THE REALM TO WHICH THE LAST APPEAL LAY
5147-32135-0024 THE RITES OF MARRIAGE SAYS PRESCOTT WERE CELEBRATED WITH AS MUCH FORMALITY AS IN ANY CHRISTIAN COUNTRY AND THE INSTITUTION WAS HELD IN SUCH REVERENCE THAT A TRIBUNAL WAS INSTITUTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING QUESTIONS RELATING TO IT
5147-32135-0025 DIVORCES COULD NOT BE OBTAINED UNTIL AUTHORIZED BY A SENTENCE OF THE COURT AFTER A PATIENT HEARING OF THE PARTIES SLAVERY WAS TOLERATED BUT THE LABORS OF THE SLAVE WERE LIGHT HIS RIGHTS CAREFULLY GUARDED AND HIS CHILDREN WERE FREE THE SLAVE COULD OWN PROPERTY AND EVEN OTHER SLAVES
5147-32135-0026 THAT THE SPANISH PRIESTS DECLARED THE DEVIL HAD GIVEN THEM A BOGUS IMITATION OF CHRISTIANITY TO DESTROY THEIR SOULS THE DEVIL SAID THEY STOLE ALL HE COULD THEY HAD CONFESSIONS ABSOLUTION OF SINS AND BAPTISM
5147-32135-0027 WHEN THEIR CHILDREN WERE NAMED THEY SPRINKLED THEIR LIPS AND BOSOMS WITH WATER AND THE LORD WAS IMPLORED TO PERMIT THE HOLY DROPS TO WASH AWAY THE SIN THAT WAS GIVEN IT BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD THE PRIESTS WERE NUMEROUS AND POWERFUL
5147-32135-0028 THEY PRACTISED FASTS VIGILS FLAGELLATIONS AND MANY OF THEM LIVED IN MONASTIC SECLUSION THE AZTECS LIKE THE EGYPTIANS HAD PROGRESSED THROUGH ALL THE THREE DIFFERENT MODES OF WRITING THE PICTURE WRITING THE SYMBOLICAL AND THE PHONETIC
5147-32135-0029 THEY RECORDED ALL THEIR LAWS THEIR TRIBUTE ROLLS SPECIFYING THE VARIOUS IMPOSTS THEIR MYTHOLOGY ASTRONOMICAL CALENDARS AND RITUALS THEIR POLITICAL ANNALS AND THEIR CHRONOLOGY THEY WROTE ON COTTON CLOTH ON SKINS PREPARED LIKE PARCHMENT
5147-32135-0030 ON A COMPOSITION OF SILK AND GUM AND ON A SPECIES OF PAPER SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL MADE FROM THE ALOE THEIR BOOKS WERE ABOUT THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF OUR OWN BUT THE LEAVES WERE LONG STRIPS FOLDED TOGETHER IN MANY FOLDS THEY WROTE POETRY AND CULTIVATED ORATORY
5147-32135-0031 AND PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO RHETORIC THEY ALSO HAD A SPECIES OF THEATRICAL PERFORMANCES THEIR PROFICIENCY IN ASTRONOMY IS THUS SPOKEN OF BY PRESCOTT THAT THEY SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY ADJUSTING THEIR FESTIVALS BY THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES
5147-32135-0032 AND SHOULD FIX THE TRUE LENGTH OF THE TROPICAL YEAR WITH A PRECISION UNKNOWN TO THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS OF ANTIQUITY COULD BE THE RESULT ONLY OF A LONG SERIES OF NICE AND PATIENT OBSERVATIONS EVINCING NO SLIGHT PROGRESS IN CIVILIZATION
5147-32135-0033 THEIR WOMEN SAYS THE SAME AUTHOR ARE DESCRIBED BY THE SPANIARDS AS PRETTY THOUGH WITH A SERIOUS AND RATHER MELANCHOLY CAST OF COUNTENANCE THEIR LONG BLACK HAIR MIGHT GENERALLY BE SEEN WREATHED WITH FLOWERS OR AMONG THE RICHER PEOPLE
5147-32135-0034 WITH STRINGS OF PRECIOUS STONES AND PEARLS FROM THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA
5147-32135-0035 AND PASSED THEIR TIME IN INDOLENT TRANQUILLITY
5147-32135-0036 EMBROIDERY AND THE LIKE WHILE THEIR MAIDENS BEGUILED THE HOURS BY THE REHEARSAL OF TRADITIONARY TALES AND BALLADS NUMEROUS ATTENDANTS OF BOTH SEXES WAITED AT THE BANQUETS THE BALLS WERE SCENTED WITH PERFUMES AND THE COURTS STREWED WITH ODORIFEROUS HERBS AND FLOWERS
5147-32135-0037 WHICH WERE DISTRIBUTED IN PROFUSION AMONG THE GUESTS AS THEY ARRIVED COTTON NAPKINS AND EWERS OF WATER WERE PLACED BEFORE THEM AS THEY TOOK THEIR SEATS AT THE BOARD
5147-32135-0038 THE TABLE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH SUBSTANTIAL MEATS ESPECIALLY GAME AMONG WHICH THE MOST CONSPICUOUS WAS THE TURKEY ALSO THERE WERE FOUND VERY DELICIOUS VEGETABLES AND FRUITS OF EVERY VARIETY NATIVE TO THE CONTINENT
5147-32135-0039 AT MYCENAE ON PAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR ONE OF THE OLDEST STRUCTURES IN GREECE WE FIND PRECISELY THE SAME FORM OF ARCH FILLED IN IN THE SAME WAY ROSENGARTEN
5147-32135-0040 THE BASE OF THESE TREASURE HOUSES IS CIRCULAR AND THE COVERING OF A DOME SHAPE IT DOES NOT HOWEVER FORM AN ARCH BUT COURSES OF STONE ARE LAID HORIZONTALLY OVER ONE ANOTHER IN SUCH A WAY THAT EACH COURSE PROJECTS BEYOND THE ONE BELOW IT
5147-32135-0041 TILL THE SPACE AT THE HIGHEST COURSE BECOMES SO NARROW THAT A SINGLE STONE COVERS IT
5147-32135-0042 THE SAME FORM OF ARCH IS FOUND AMONG THE RUINS OF THAT INTERESTING PEOPLE THE ETRUSCANS ETRUSCAN VAULTS ARE OF TWO KINDS THE MORE CURIOUS AND PROBABLY THE MOST ANCIENT ARE FALSE ARCHES
5147-32135-0043 FORMED OF HORIZONTAL COURSES OF STONE EACH A LITTLE OVERLAPPING THE OTHER
