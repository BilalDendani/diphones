91-123498-0000 IN SUBMITTING CAPTAIN CARTER'S STRANGE MANUSCRIPT TO YOU IN BOOK FORM I BELIEVE THAT A FEW WORDS RELATIVE TO THIS REMARKABLE PERSONALITY WILL BE OF INTEREST MY FIRST RECOLLECTION OF CAPTAIN CARTER IS OF THE FEW MONTHS
91-123498-0001 HE SPENT AT MY FATHER'S HOME IN VIRGINIA JUST PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE CIVIL WAR I WAS THEN A CHILD OF BUT FIVE YEARS
91-123498-0002 DARK SMOOTH FACED ATHLETIC MAN WHOM I CALLED UNCLE JACK HE SEEMED ALWAYS TO BE LAUGHING
91-123498-0003 AND HE ENTERED INTO THE SPORTS OF THE CHILDREN WITH THE SAME HEARTY GOOD FELLOWSHIP HE DISPLAYED TOWARD THOSE PASTIMES IN WHICH THE MEN AND WOMEN OF HIS OWN AGE INDULGED
91-123498-0004 WILD LIFE IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD WE ALL LOVED HIM AND OUR SLAVES FAIRLY WORSHIPPED THE GROUND HE TROD HE WAS A SPLENDID SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD STANDING A GOOD TWO INCHES OVER SIX FEET BROAD OF SHOULDER AND NARROW OF HIP
91-123498-0005 WITH THE CARRIAGE OF THE TRAINED FIGHTING MAN HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND CLEAR CUT HIS HAIR BLACK AND CLOSELY CROPPED WHILE HIS EYES WERE OF A STEEL GRAY REFLECTING A STRONG AND LOYAL CHARACTER FILLED WITH FIRE
91-123498-0006 AND INITIATIVE HIS MANNERS WERE PERFECT AND HIS COURTLINESS WAS THAT OF A TYPICAL SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN OF THE HIGHEST TYPE HIS HORSEMANSHIP ESPECIALLY AFTER HOUNDS WAS A MARVEL AND DELIGHT
91-123498-0007 EVEN IN THAT COUNTRY OF MAGNIFICENT HORSEMEN I HAVE OFTEN HEARD MY FATHER CAUTION HIM AGAINST HIS WILD RECKLESSNESS BUT HE WOULD ONLY LAUGH AND SAY THAT THE TUMBLE THAT KILLED HIM WOULD BE FROM THE BACK OF A HORSE YET UNFOALED
91-123498-0008 WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT HE LEFT US NOR DID I SEE HIM AGAIN FOR SOME FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS WHEN HE RETURNED IT WAS WITHOUT WARNING AND I WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO NOTE THAT HE HAD NOT AGED APPARENTLY A MOMENT
91-123498-0009 THE SAME GENIAL HAPPY FELLOW WE HAD KNOWN OF OLD BUT WHEN HE THOUGHT HIMSELF ALONE I HAVE SEEN HIM SIT FOR HOURS GAZING OFF INTO SPACE HIS FACE SET IN A LOOK OF WISTFUL LONGING AND HOPELESS MISERY AND AT NIGHT HE WOULD SIT THUS
91-123498-0010 LOOKING UP INTO THE HEAVENS AT WHAT I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I READ HIS MANUSCRIPT YEARS AFTERWARD HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD BEEN PROSPECTING AND MINING IN ARIZONA PART OF THE TIME SINCE THE WAR
91-123498-0011 AND THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL WAS EVIDENCED BY THE UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH WHICH HE WAS SUPPLIED
91-123498-0012 IN FACT HE WOULD NOT TALK OF THEM AT ALL HE REMAINED WITH US FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND THEN WENT TO NEW YORK WHERE HE PURCHASED A LITTLE PLACE ON THE HUDSON WHERE I VISITED HIM ONCE A YEAR ON THE OCCASIONS OF MY TRIPS TO THE NEW YORK MARKET
91-123498-0013 MY FATHER AND I OWNING AND OPERATING A STRING OF GENERAL STORES THROUGHOUT VIRGINIA AT THAT TIME CAPTAIN CARTER HAD A SMALL BUT BEAUTIFUL COTTAGE SITUATED ON A BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE RIVER AND DURING ONE OF MY LAST VISITS IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
91-123498-0014 I OBSERVED HE WAS MUCH OCCUPIED IN WRITING I PRESUME NOW UPON THIS MANUSCRIPT HE TOLD ME AT THIS TIME THAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HIM HE WISHED ME TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS ESTATE
91-123498-0015 TELLING ME I WOULD FIND HIS WILL THERE AND SOME PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS WHICH HE HAD ME PLEDGE MYSELF TO CARRY OUT WITH ABSOLUTE FIDELITY AFTER I HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
91-123498-0016 I HAVE SEEN HIM FROM MY WINDOW STANDING IN THE MOONLIGHT ON THE BRINK OF THE BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON WITH HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT TO THE HEAVENS AS THOUGH IN APPEAL I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS PRAYING
91-123498-0017 ALTHOUGH I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE TERM A RELIGIOUS MAN SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER I HAD RETURNED HOME FROM MY LAST VISIT
91-123498-0018 I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM HIM ASKING ME TO COME TO HIM AT ONCE I HAD
91-123498-0019 AND SO I HASTENED TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMAND I ARRIVED AT THE LITTLE STATION ABOUT A MILE FROM HIS GROUNDS ON THE MORNING OF MARCH FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX
91-123498-0020 IF I WAS A FRIEND OF THE CAPTAIN'S HE HAD SOME VERY BAD NEWS FOR ME THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD SHORTLY AFTER DAYLIGHT THAT VERY MORNING BY THE WATCHMAN ATTACHED TO AN ADJOINING PROPERTY FOR SOME REASON THIS NEWS DID NOT SURPRISE ME BUT
91-123498-0021 I HURRIED OUT TO HIS PLACE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT I COULD TAKE CHARGE OF THE BODY AND OF HIS AFFAIRS I FOUND THE WATCHMAN WHO HAD DISCOVERED HIM TOGETHER WITH THE LOCAL POLICE CHIEF AND SEVERAL TOWNSPEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN HIS LITTLE STUDY
91-123498-0022 THE WATCHMAN RELATED THE FEW DETAILS CONNECTED WITH THE FINDING OF THE BODY
91-123498-0023 WHEN HE CAME UPON IT IT LAY HE SAID STRETCHED FULL LENGTH IN THE SNOW WITH THE ARMS OUTSTRETCHED ABOVE THE HEAD TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF AND WHEN HE SHOWED ME THE SPOT IT FLASHED UPON ME THAT IT WAS THE IDENTICAL ONE
91-123498-0024 WHERE I HAD SEEN HIM ON THOSE OTHER NIGHTS WITH HIS ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION TO THE SKIES THERE WERE NO MARKS OF VIOLENCE ON THE BODY AND WITH THE AID OF A LOCAL PHYSICIAN THE CORONER'S JURY QUICKLY REACHED A DECISION OF DEATH FROM HEART FAILURE
91-123498-0025 LEFT ALONE IN THE STUDY I OPENED THE SAFE AND WITHDREW THE CONTENTS OF THE DRAWER IN WHICH HE HAD TOLD ME I WOULD FIND MY INSTRUCTIONS THEY WERE IN PART PECULIAR INDEED
91-123498-0026 BUT I HAVE FOLLOWED THEM TO EACH LAST DETAIL AS FAITHFULLY AS I WAS ABLE HE DIRECTED THAT I REMOVE HIS BODY TO VIRGINIA WITHOUT EMBALMING AND THAT HE BE LAID IN AN OPEN COFFIN WITHIN A TOMB
91-123498-0027 WHICH HE PREVIOUSLY HAD HAD CONSTRUCTED AND WHICH AS I LATER LEARNED
91-123498-0028 EVEN IN SECRECY IF NECESSARY HIS PROPERTY WAS LEFT IN SUCH A WAY THAT I WAS TO RECEIVE THE ENTIRE INCOME FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHEN THE PRINCIPAL WAS TO BECOME MINE
91-123498-0029 HIS FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS RELATED TO THIS MANUSCRIPT WHICH I WAS TO RETAIN SEALED AND UNREAD JUST AS I FOUND IT FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOR WAS I TO DIVULGE ITS CONTENTS UNTIL TWENTY ONE YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH
91-123498-0030 A STRANGE FEATURE ABOUT THE TOMB WHERE HIS BODY STILL LIES IS THAT THE MASSIVE DOOR IS EQUIPPED WITH A SINGLE HUGE GOLD PLATED SPRING LOCK WHICH CAN BE OPENED ONLY FROM THE INSIDE
