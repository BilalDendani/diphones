8329-279775-0005 SHE HAD ALSO A VERY GOOD OPINION OF HERSELF AND WHEN ANY ONE PRAISED THE PRINCESS WOULD SAY ANGRILY THAT IS A LIE MY LITTLE FINGER IS WORTH HER WHOLE BODY IN COURSE OF TIME THE QUEEN FELL SICK AND DIED

8329-279775-0022 AND TO PASS THE TIME AWAY SHE WENT ALL ALONE INTO A LITTLE WOOD WHERE SHE SOBBED AND WEPT IN SECRET UNTIL SUDDENLY THERE APPEARED BEFORE HER A YOUNG PAGE WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE WHO ARE YOU SHE INQUIRED
8329-279775-0023 AND WHEN DID HIS MAJESTY TAKE YOU INTO HIS SERVICE PRINCESS SAID THE PAGE BOWING I AM IN NO ONE'S SERVICE BUT YOUR OWN I AM PERCINET A PRINCE IN MY OWN COUNTRY SO THAT THERE IS NO INEQUALITY OF RANK BETWEEN US

8329-279775-0026 THEY TALKED A LITTLE WHILE TOGETHER AND THEN RETURNED TO THE PALACE WHERE THE PAGE ASSISTED HER TO MOUNT HER HORSE ON WHICH SHE LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL THAT ALL THE NEW QUEEN'S SPLENDOURS FADED INTO NOTHING IN COMPARISON AND NOT ONE OF THE COURTIERS HAD EYES FOR ANY EXCEPT GRACIOSA
8329-279775-0027 AS SOON AS GROGNON SAW IT WHAT CRIED SHE HAS THIS CREATURE THE IMPUDENCE TO BE BETTER MOUNTED THAN MYSELF DESCEND MISS AND LET ME TRY YOUR HORSE AND YOUR PAGE WHOM EVERYBODY THINKS SO MUCH OF BID HIM COME AND HOLD MY BRIDLE
8329-279775-0028 BUT NO SOONER HAD THE DUCHESS MOUNTED THAN THE HORSE RAN AWAY WITH HER AND DRAGGED HER OVER BRIERS STONES AND MUD AND FINALLY THREW HER INTO A DEEP DITCH HER HEAD WAS CUT IN SEVERAL PLACES AND HER ARM FRACTURED

8329-279775-0031 AND GRACIOSA WAS COMMANDED TO APPEAR SHE CAME TREMBLING AND LOOKING ROUND VAINLY FOR PRINCE PERCINET THE CRUEL GROGNON ORDERED FOUR WOMEN UGLY AS WITCHES TO TAKE HER AND STRIP OFF HER FINE CLOTHES
8329-279775-0032 AND WHIP HER WITH RODS TILL HER WHITE SHOULDERS WERE RED WITH BLOOD BUT LO AS SOON AS THE RODS TOUCHED HER THEY TURNED INTO BUNDLES OF FEATHERS AND THE WOMEN TIRED THEMSELVES TO DEATH WITH WHIPPING

8329-279775-0035 SOON AFTER THE KING WHO KNEW THAT HIS WIFE'S WEAK POINT WAS HER VANITY GAVE A TOURNAMENT AT WHICH HE ORDERED THE SIX BRAVEST KNIGHTS OF THE COURT TO PROCLAIM THAT QUEEN GROGNON WAS THE FAIREST LADY ALIVE
8329-279775-0036 NO KNIGHT VENTURED TO DISPUTE THIS FACT UNTIL THERE APPEARED ONE WHO CARRIED A LITTLE BOX ADORNED WITH DIAMONDS AND PROCLAIMED ALOUD THAT GROGNON WAS THE UGLIEST WOMAN IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WAS SHE WHOSE PORTRAIT WAS IN THE BOX
8329-279775-0037 HE OPENED IT AND BEHOLD THE IMAGE OF THE PRINCESS GRACIOSA THE PRINCESS WHO SAT BEHIND HER STEPMOTHER FELT SURE THAT THE UNKNOWN KNIGHT WAS PERCINET BUT SHE DARED SAY NOTHING THE CONTEST WAS FIXED FOR NEXT DAY
