4836-26485-0000 BY THE EXPEDITION HE HAD MADE AGAINST THEM WITH A GREAT AND WARLIKE ARMY HE ALSO REDUCED THEIR CITIES INTO SLAVERY AND THAT NOT ONLY BY SUBDUING THEM FOR THE PRESENT WHICH HE DID BY FORCE AND VIOLENCE
4836-26485-0001 BUT BY WEAKENING THEM BY SUBTLETY AND CUNNING THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE AFTERWARD TO GET CLEAR OF THE SLAVERY THEY WERE UNDER TO HIM
4836-26485-0002 OR WERE TAKEN BY HIM IN WAR AND THIS HE DID THAT WHEN THEIR LEFT EYES WERE COVERED BY THEIR SHIELDS THEY MIGHT BE WHOLLY USELESS IN WAR NOW WHEN THE KING OF THE AMMONITES HAD SERVED THOSE BEYOND JORDAN IN THIS MANNER
4836-26485-0003 HE LED HIS ARMY AGAINST THOSE THAT WERE CALLED GILEADITES AND HAVING PITCHED HIS CAMP AT THE METROPOLIS OF HIS ENEMIES WHICH WAS THE CITY OF JABESH HE SENT AMBASSADORS TO THEM COMMANDING THEM EITHER TO DELIVER THEMSELVES UP
4836-26485-0004 ON CONDITION TO HAVE THEIR RIGHT EYES PLUCKED OUT OR TO UNDERGO A SIEGE AND TO HAVE THEIR CITIES OVERTHROWN HE GAVE THEM THEIR CHOICE WHETHER THEY WOULD CUT OFF A SMALL MEMBER OF THEIR BODY OR UNIVERSALLY PERISH
4836-26485-0005 HOWEVER THE GILEADITES WERE SO AFFRIGHTED AT THESE OFFERS THAT THEY HAD NOT COURAGE TO SAY ANY THING TO EITHER OF THEM NEITHER THAT THEY WOULD DELIVER THEMSELVES UP NOR THAT THEY WOULD FIGHT HIM
4836-26485-0006 BUT THEY DESIRED THAT HE WOULD GIVE THEM SEVEN DAYS RESPITE THAT THEY MIGHT SEND AMBASSADORS TO THEIR COUNTRYMEN AND ENTREAT THEIR ASSISTANCE AND IF THEY CAME TO ASSIST THEM THEY WOULD FIGHT BUT IF THAT ASSISTANCE WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE OBTAINED FROM THEM
4836-26485-0007 ALLOWED THEM A RESPITE AND GAVE THEM LEAVE TO SEND TO WHOMSOEVER THEY PLEASED FOR ASSISTANCE SO THEY IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE ISRAELITES CITY BY CITY AND INFORMED THEM WHAT NABASH HAD THREATENED TO DO TO THEM
4836-26485-0008 AND WHAT GREAT DISTRESS THEY WERE IN NOW THE PEOPLE FELL INTO TEARS AND GRIEF AT THE HEARING OF WHAT THE AMBASSADORS FROM JABESH SAID AND THE TERROR THEY WERE IN PERMITTED THEM TO DO NOTHING MORE
4836-26485-0009 BUT WHEN THE MESSENGERS WERE COME TO THE CITY OF KING SAUL AND DECLARED THE DANGERS IN WHICH THE INHABITANTS OF JABESH WERE THE PEOPLE WERE IN THE SAME AFFLICTION AS THOSE IN THE OTHER CITIES FOR THEY LAMENTED THE CALAMITY OF THOSE RELATED TO THEM
4836-26485-0010 AND WHEN SAUL WAS RETURNED FROM HIS HUSBANDRY INTO THE CITY HE FOUND HIS FELLOW CITIZENS WEEPING AND WHEN UPON INQUIRY HE HAD LEARNED THE CAUSE OF THE CONFUSION AND SADNESS THEY WERE IN HE WAS SEIZED WITH A DIVINE FURY
4836-26485-0011 AND SENT AWAY THE AMBASSADORS FROM THE INHABITANTS OF JABESH AND PROMISED THEM TO COME TO THEIR ASSISTANCE ON THE THIRD DAY AND TO BEAT THEIR ENEMIES BEFORE SUN RISING THAT THE SUN UPON ITS RISING MIGHT SEE THAT THEY HAD ALREADY CONQUERED
4836-26485-0012 AND WERE FREED FROM THE FEARS THEY WERE UNDER BUT HE BID SOME OF THEM STAY
4836-26485-0013 BEING DESIROUS TO TURN THE PEOPLE TO THIS WAR AGAINST THE AMMONITES BY FEAR OF THE LOSSES THEY SHOULD OTHERWISE UNDERGO AND THAT THEY MIGHT THE MORE SUDDENLY BE GATHERED TOGETHER HE CUT THE SINEWS OF HIS OXEN
4836-26485-0014 AND THREATENED TO DO THE SAME TO ALL SUCH AS DID NOT COME WITH THEIR ARMOR TO JORDAN THE NEXT DAY AND FOLLOW HIM AND SAMUEL THE PROPHET WHITHERSOEVER THEY SHOULD LEAD THEM SO THEY CAME TOGETHER OUT OF FEAR OF THE LOSSES THEY WERE THREATENED WITH
4836-26485-0015 AT THE APPOINTED TIME AND THE MULTITUDE WERE NUMBERED AT THE CITY BEZEK AND HE FOUND THE NUMBER OF THOSE THAT WERE GATHERED TOGETHER BESIDES THAT OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH TO BE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WHILE THOSE OF THAT TRIBE WERE SEVENTY THOUSAND
4836-26485-0016 SO HE PASSED OVER JORDAN AND PROCEEDED IN MARCHING ALL THAT NIGHT THIRTY FURLONGS AND CAME TO JABESH BEFORE SUN RISING SO HE DIVIDED THE ARMY INTO THREE COMPANIES AND FELL UPON THEIR ENEMIES ON EVERY SIDE ON THE SUDDEN
4836-26485-0017 AND WHEN THEY EXPECTED NO SUCH THING AND JOINING BATTLE WITH THEM
4836-26485-0018 THIS GLORIOUS ACTION WAS DONE BY SAUL AND WAS RELATED WITH GREAT COMMENDATION OF HIM TO ALL THE HEBREWS AND HE THENCE GAINED A WONDERFUL REPUTATION FOR HIS VALOR FOR ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME OF THEM THAT CONTEMNED HIM BEFORE
4836-26485-0019 THEY NOW CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND HONORED HIM AND ESTEEMED HIM AS THE BEST OF MEN FOR HE DID NOT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH HAVING SAVED THE INHABITANTS OF JABESH ONLY BUT HE MADE AN EXPEDITION INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE AMMONITES
4836-26485-0020 AND LAID IT ALL WASTE AND TOOK A LARGE PREY AND SO RETURNED TO HIS OWN COUNTRY MOST GLORIOUSLY SO THE PEOPLE WERE GREATLY PLEASED AT THESE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES OF SAUL AND REJOICED THAT THEY HAD CONSTITUTED HIM THEIR KING
4836-26485-0021 THEY ALSO MADE A CLAMOR AGAINST THOSE THAT PRETENDED HE WOULD BE OF NO ADVANTAGE TO THEIR AFFAIRS AND THEY SAID WHERE NOW ARE THESE MEN LET THEM BE BROUGHT TO PUNISHMENT WITH ALL THE LIKE THINGS THAT
4836-26485-0022 MULTITUDES USUALLY SAY WHEN THEY ARE ELEVATED WITH PROSPERITY AGAINST THOSE THAT LATELY HAD DESPISED THE AUTHORS OF IT BUT SAUL ALTHOUGH HE TOOK THE GOOD WILL AND THE AFFECTION OF THESE MEN VERY KINDLY
4836-26485-0023 YET DID HE SWEAR THAT HE WOULD NOT SEE ANY OF HIS COUNTRYMEN SLAIN THAT DAY SINCE IT WAS ABSURD TO MIX THIS VICTORY WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN THEM WITH THE BLOOD AND SLAUGHTER OF THOSE THAT WERE OF THE SAME LINEAGE WITH THEMSELVES
4836-26485-0024 AND THAT IT WAS MORE AGREEABLE TO BE MEN OF A FRIENDLY DISPOSITION
4836-26485-0025 THAT HE OUGHT TO CONFIRM THE KINGDOM TO SAUL BY A SECOND ORDINATION OF HIM THEY ALL CAME TOGETHER TO THE CITY OF GILGAL FOR THITHER DID HE COMMAND THEM TO COME SO THE PROPHET ANOINTED SAUL WITH THE HOLY OIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE MULTITUDE
4836-26485-0026 AND DECLARED HIM TO BE KING THE SECOND TIME AND SO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HEBREWS WAS CHANGED INTO A REGAL GOVERNMENT FOR IN THE DAYS OF MOSES AND HIS DISCIPLE JOSHUA WHO WAS THEIR GENERAL THEY CONTINUED UNDER AN ARISTOCRACY
4836-26485-0027 BUT AFTER THE DEATH OF JOSHUA FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS IN ALL THE MULTITUDE HAD NO SETTLED FORM OF GOVERNMENT BUT WERE IN AN ANARCHY AFTER WHICH THEY RETURNED TO THEIR FORMER GOVERNMENT
4836-26485-0028 THEY THEN PERMITTING THEMSELVES TO BE JUDGED BY HIM WHO APPEARED TO BE THE BEST WARRIOR AND MOST COURAGEOUS WHENCE IT WAS THAT THEY CALLED THIS INTERVAL OF THEIR GOVERNMENT
4836-26485-0029 AND SAID TO THEM I SOLEMNLY ADJURE YOU BY GOD ALMIGHTY WHO BROUGHT THOSE EXCELLENT BRETHREN I MEAN MOSES AND AARON INTO THE WORLD AND DELIVERED OUR FATHERS FROM THE EGYPTIANS AND FROM THE SLAVERY THEY ENDURED UNDER THEM
4836-26485-0030 THAT YOU WILL NOT SPEAK WHAT YOU SAY TO GRATIFY ME
4836-26485-0031 BUT SAY WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE THAT WAS CRUEL OR UNJUST OR WHAT HAVE I DONE OUT OF LUCRE OR COVETOUSNESS
4836-26485-0032 BEAR WITNESS AGAINST ME IF I HAVE TAKEN AN OX OR A SHEEP OR ANY SUCH THING WHICH YET WHEN THEY ARE TAKEN TO SUPPORT MEN IT IS ESTEEMED BLAMELESS OR HAVE I TAKEN AN ASS FOR MINE OWN USE OF ANY ONE TO HIS GRIEF
4836-26485-0033 LAY SOME ONE SUCH CRIME TO MY CHARGE NOW WE ARE IN YOUR KING'S PRESENCE BUT THEY CRIED OUT THAT NO SUCH THING HAD BEEN DONE BY HIM
4836-26485-0034 SUCH A TESTIMONY HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM BY THEM ALL SAID SINCE YOU GRANT THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO LAY ANY ILL THING TO MY CHARGE HITHERTO COME ON NOW AND DO YOU HEARKEN WHILE I SPEAK WITH GREAT FREEDOM TO YOU
4836-26485-0035 BY REASON OF A FAMINE WITH SEVENTY SOULS ONLY OF OUR FAMILY AND THAT THEIR POSTERITY MULTIPLIED THERE TO MANY TEN THOUSANDS WHOM THE EGYPTIANS BROUGHT INTO SLAVERY AND HARD OPPRESSION
4836-26485-0036 THAT GOD HIMSELF UPON THE PRAYERS OF OUR FATHERS SENT MOSES AND AARON WHO WERE BRETHREN AND GAVE THEM POWER TO DELIVER THE MULTITUDE OUT OF THEIR DISTRESS AND THIS WITHOUT
4836-26485-0037 A KING THESE BROUGHT US INTO THIS VERY LAND WHICH YOU NOW POSSESS AND WHEN YOU ENJOYED THESE ADVANTAGES FROM GOD YOU BETRAYED HIS WORSHIP AND RELIGION NAY MOREOVER
4836-26485-0038 WHEN YOU WERE BROUGHT UNDER THE HANDS OF YOUR ENEMIES HE DELIVERED YOU FIRST BY RENDERING YOU SUPERIOR TO THE ASSYRIANS AND THEIR FORCES HE THEN MADE YOU TO OVERCOME THE AMMONITES AND THE MOABITES AND LAST OF ALL THE PHILISTINES
4836-26485-0039 AND THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED UNDER THE CONDUCT OF JEPHTHA AND GIDEON WHAT MADNESS THEREFORE POSSESSED YOU TO FLY FROM GOD
4836-26485-0040 YET HAVE I ORDAINED HIM FOR KING WHOM HE CHOSE FOR YOU HOWEVER THAT I MAY MAKE IT PLAIN TO YOU THAT GOD IS ANGRY AND DISPLEASED AT YOUR CHOICE OF KINGLY GOVERNMENT
4836-26485-0041 FOR WHAT NONE OF YOU EVER SAW HERE BEFORE I MEAN A WINTER STORM
4836-26485-0042 AND WILL MAKE IT VISIBLE TO YOU NOW AS SOON AS HE HAD SAID THIS GOD GAVE SUCH GREAT SIGNALS BY THUNDER AND LIGHTNING AND THE DESCENT OF HAIL
4836-26485-0043 AS ATTESTED THE TRUTH OF ALL THAT THE PROPHET HAD SAID INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE AMAZED AND TERRIFIED AND CONFESSED THEY HAD SINNED AND HAD FALLEN INTO THAT SIN THROUGH IGNORANCE AND BESOUGHT THE PROPHET
4836-26485-0044 AS ONE THAT WAS A TENDER AND GENTLE FATHER TO THEM TO RENDER GOD SO MERCIFUL AS TO FORGIVE THIS THEIR SIN WHICH THEY HAD ADDED TO THOSE OTHER OFFENSES WHEREBY THEY HAD AFFRONTED HIM AND TRANSGRESSED AGAINST HIM
4836-26485-0045 IF THEY HAD ANY DESIRE OF BEING PRESERVED AND MADE HAPPY WITH THEIR KING BUT HE SAID THAT IF THEY SHOULD GROW CARELESS OF THESE THINGS GREAT JUDGMENTS WOULD COME FROM GOD UPON THEM AND UPON THEIR KING
4836-26485-0046 AND WHEN SAMUEL HAD THUS PROPHESIED TO THE HEBREWS HE DISMISSED THEM TO THEIR OWN HOMES HAVING CONFIRMED THE KINGDOM TO SAUL THE SECOND TIME
4836-26485-0047 HOW THE PHILISTINES MADE ANOTHER EXPEDITION AGAINST THE HEBREWS
4836-26485-0048 ABOUT THREE THOUSAND MEN AND HE TOOK TWO THOUSAND OF THEM TO BE THE GUARDS OF HIS OWN BODY AND ABODE IN THE CITY BETHEL BUT HE GAVE THE REST OF THEM TO JONATHAN HIS SON TO BE THE GUARDS OF HIS BODY AND SENT HIM TO GIBEAH
4836-26485-0049 WHERE HE BESIEGED AND TOOK A CERTAIN GARRISON OF THE PHILISTINES NOT FAR FROM GILGAL FOR THE PHILISTINES OF GIBEAH HAD BEATEN THE JEWS AND TAKEN THEIR WEAPONS AWAY AND HAD PUT GARRISONS INTO THE STRONGEST PLACES OF THE COUNTRY
4836-26485-0050 AND HAD FORBIDDEN THEM TO CARRY ANY INSTRUMENT OF IRON OR AT ALL TO MAKE USE OF ANY IRON IN ANY CASE WHATSOEVER AND ON ACCOUNT OF THIS PROHIBITION IT WAS THAT THE HUSBANDMEN IF THEY HAD OCCASION TO SHARPEN ANY OF THEIR TOOLS
4836-26485-0051 WHETHER IT WERE THE COULTER OR THE SPADE OR ANY INSTRUMENT OF HUSBANDRY THEY CAME TO THE PHILISTINES TO DO IT NOW AS SOON AS THE PHILISTINES HEARD OF THIS SLAUGHTER OF THEIR GARRISON THEY WERE IN A RAGE ABOUT IT
4836-26485-0052 AND LOOKING ON THIS CONTEMPT AS A TERRIBLE AFFRONT OFFERED THEM THEY MADE WAR AGAINST THE JEWS WITH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOOTMEN AND THIRTY THOUSAND CHARIOTS AND SIX THOUSAND HORSES
4836-26485-0053 WHEN SAUL THE KING OF THE HEBREWS WAS INFORMED OF THIS HE WENT DOWN TO THE CITY GILGAL AND MADE PROCLAMATION OVER ALL THE COUNTRY THAT THEY SHOULD TRY TO REGAIN THEIR LIBERTY AND CALLED THEM TO THE WAR AGAINST THE PHILISTINES
4836-26485-0054 DIMINISHING THEIR FORCES AND DESPISING THEM AS NOT VERY CONSIDERABLE AND AS NOT SO GREAT BUT THEY MIGHT HAZARD A BATTLE WITH THEM BUT WHEN THE PEOPLE ABOUT SAUL OBSERVED HOW NUMEROUS THE PHILISTINES WERE
4836-26485-0055 THEY WERE UNDER A GREAT CONSTERNATION AND SOME OF THEM HID THEMSELVES IN CAVES AND IN DENS UNDER GROUND BUT THE GREATER PART FLED INTO THE LAND BEYOND JORDAN
4836-26485-0056 SENT TO THE PROPHET AND CALLED HIM TO CONSULT WITH HIM ABOUT THE WAR AND THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS SO HE COMMANDED HIM TO STAY THERE FOR HIM AND TO PREPARE SACRIFICES FOR HE WOULD COME TO HIM WITHIN SEVEN DAYS
4836-26485-0057 THAT THEY MIGHT OFFER SACRIFICES ON THE SEVENTH DAY AND MIGHT THEN JOIN BATTLE WITH THEIR ENEMIES SO
4836-26485-0058 YET DID NOT HE HOWEVER OBSERVE THE COMMAND THAT WAS GIVEN HIM BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT THE PROPHET TARRIED LONGER THAN HE EXPECTED AND THAT HE WAS DESERTED BY THE SOLDIERS HE TOOK THE SACRIFICES AND OFFERED THEM
4836-26485-0059 AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT SAMUEL WAS COME HE WENT OUT TO MEET HIM BUT THE PROPHET SAID HE HAD NOT DONE WELL IN DISOBEYING THE INJUNCTIONS HE HAD SENT TO HIM AND HAD NOT STAID TILL HIS COMING WHICH
4836-26485-0060 BEING APPOINTED ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF GOD HE HAD PREVENTED HIM IN OFFERING UP THOSE PRAYERS AND THOSE SACRIFICES THAT HE SHOULD HAVE MADE FOR THE MULTITUDE AND THAT HE THEREFORE
4836-26485-0061 HAD PERFORMED DIVINE OFFICES IN AN ILL MANNER AND HAD BEEN RASH IN PERFORMING THEM HEREUPON SAUL MADE AN APOLOGY FOR HIMSELF AND SAID THAT HE HAD WAITED AS MANY DAYS AS SAMUEL HAD APPOINTED HIM
4836-26485-0062 THAT HE HAD BEEN SO QUICK IN OFFERING HIS SACRIFICES UPON ACCOUNT OF THE NECESSITY HE WAS IN AND BECAUSE HIS SOLDIERS WERE DEPARTING FROM HIM
4836-26485-0063 THE REPORT BEING GONE ABROAD THAT THEY WERE COMING DOWN UPON HIM OF GILGAL TO WHICH SAMUEL REPLIED
4836-26485-0064 NOR SLIGHTED THE COMMANDS WHICH GOD SUGGESTED TO ME CONCERNING THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS AND HADST NOT ACTED MORE HASTILY THAN THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRED THOU WOULDST HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO REIGN A LONG TIME AND THY POSTERITY AFTER THEE
4836-26485-0065 SO SAMUEL BEING GRIEVED AT WHAT HAPPENED RETURNED HOME BUT SAUL CAME TO THE CITY GIBEAH WITH HIS SON JONATHAN HAVING ONLY SIX HUNDRED MEN WITH HIM AND OF THESE THE GREATER PART HAD NO WEAPONS
4836-26485-0066 BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF IRON IN THAT COUNTRY AS WELL AS OF THOSE THAT COULD MAKE SUCH WEAPONS
4836-26485-0067 OR SUCH WORKMEN NOW THE PHILISTINES DIVIDED THEIR ARMY INTO THREE COMPANIES AND TOOK AS MANY ROADS AND LAID WASTE THE COUNTRY OF THE HEBREWS WHILE KING SAUL AND HIS SON JONATHAN SAW WHAT WAS DONE BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO DEFEND THE LAND
4836-26485-0068 HAVING NO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MEN WITH THEM
4836-26485-0069 WHO WAS OF THE POSTERITY OF ELI THE HIGH PRIEST WERE SITTING UPON A PRETTY HIGH HILL AND SEEING THE LAND LAID WASTE THEY WERE MIGHTILY DISTURBED AT IT NOW SAUL'S SON AGREED WITH HIS ARMOR BEARER
4836-26485-0070 THAT THEY WOULD GO PRIVATELY TO THE ENEMY'S CAMP AND MAKE A TUMULT AND A DISTURBANCE AMONG THEM AND WHEN THE ARMOR BEARER HAD READILY PROMISED TO FOLLOW HIM WHITHERSOEVER HE SHOULD LEAD HIM THOUGH HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO DIE IN THE ATTEMPT
4836-26485-0071 JONATHAN MADE USE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S ASSISTANCE AND DESCENDED FROM THE HILL AND WENT TO THEIR ENEMIES NOW THE ENEMY'S CAMP WAS UPON A PRECIPICE WHICH HAD THREE TOPS
4836-26485-0072 THAT ENDED IN A SMALL BUT SHARP AND LONG EXTREMITY WHILE THERE WAS A ROCK THAT SURROUNDED THEM LIKE LINES MADE TO PREVENT THE ATTACKS OF AN ENEMY THERE IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE OUT GUARDS OF THE CAMP WERE NEGLECTED
4836-26485-0073 BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY THAT HERE AROSE FROM THE SITUATION OF THE PLACE AND BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE NOT ONLY TO ASCEND UP TO THE CAMP ON THAT QUARTER BUT SO MUCH AS TO COME NEAR IT AS SOON THEREFORE
4836-26485-0074 AS THEY CAME TO THE CAMP JONATHAN ENCOURAGED HIS ARMOR BEARER AND SAID TO HIM LET US ATTACK OUR ENEMIES AND IF WHEN THEY SEE US THEY BID US COME UP TO THEM
4836-26485-0075 BUT IF THEY SAY NOTHING AS NOT INTENDING TO INVITE US TO COME UP LET US RETURN BACK AGAIN SO WHEN THEY WERE APPROACHING TO THE ENEMY'S CAMP JUST AFTER BREAK OF DAY AND THE PHILISTINES SAW THEM
4836-26485-0076 THE HEBREWS COME OUT OF THEIR DENS AND CAVES AND THEY SAID TO JONATHAN AND TO HIS ARMOR BEARER COME ON ASCEND UP TO US THAT WE MAY INFLICT A JUST PUNISHMENT UPON YOU FOR YOUR RASH ATTEMPT UPON US
4836-26485-0077 SO SAUL'S SON ACCEPTED OF THAT INVITATION AS WHAT SIGNIFIED TO HIM VICTORY AND HE IMMEDIATELY CAME OUT OF THE PLACE WHENCE THEY WERE SEEN BY THEIR ENEMIES SO HE CHANGED HIS PLACE AND CAME TO THE ROCK
4836-26485-0078 WHICH HAD NONE TO GUARD IT BECAUSE OF ITS OWN STRENGTH FROM THENCE THEY CREPT UP WITH GREAT LABOR AND DIFFICULTY AND SO FAR OVERCAME BY FORCE THE NATURE OF THE PLACE TILL THEY WERE ABLE TO FIGHT WITH THEIR ENEMIES
4836-26485-0079 SO THEY FELL UPON THEM AS THEY WERE ASLEEP AND SLEW ABOUT TWENTY OF THEM AND THEREBY FILLED THEM WITH DISORDER AND SURPRISE INSOMUCH THAT SOME OF THEM THREW AWAY THEIR ENTIRE ARMOR AND FLED BUT THE GREATEST PART
4836-26485-0080 NOT KNOWING ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE THEY WERE OF DIFFERENT NATIONS SUSPECTED ONE ANOTHER TO BE ENEMIES
4836-26485-0081 THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF THE HEBREWS THAT CAME UP AND SO THEY FOUGHT ONE AGAINST ANOTHER AND SOME OF THEM DIED IN THE BATTLE AND SOME AS THEY WERE FLYING AWAY
4836-26485-0082 THEN HE INQUIRED WHETHER ANY BODY WAS GONE AWAY FROM THE ARMY AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT HIS SON AND WITH HIM HIS ARMOR BEARER WERE ABSENT HE BADE THE HIGH PRIEST TAKE THE GARMENTS OF HIS HIGH PRIESTHOOD
4836-26485-0083 WHO SAID THAT THEY SHOULD GET THE VICTORY AND PREVAIL AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES SO HE WENT OUT AFTER THE PHILISTINES AND SET UPON THEM AS THEY WERE SLAYING ONE ANOTHER THOSE ALSO WHO HAD FLED TO DENS AND CAVES
4836-26485-0084 UPON HEARING THAT SAUL WAS GAINING A VICTORY CAME RUNNING TO HIM WHEN THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF THE HEBREWS THAT CAME TO SAUL AMOUNTED TO ABOUT TEN THOUSAND HE PURSUED THE ENEMY WHO WERE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
4836-26485-0085 BUT THEN HE FELL INTO AN ACTION WHICH WAS A VERY UNHAPPY ONE AND LIABLE TO BE VERY MUCH BLAMED FOR WHETHER OUT OF IGNORANCE OR WHETHER OUT OF JOY FOR A VICTORY GAINED SO STRANGELY FOR IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT
4836-26485-0086 PERSONS SO FORTUNATE ARE NOT THEN ABLE TO USE THEIR REASON CONSISTENTLY AS HE WAS DESIROUS TO AVENGE HIMSELF AND TO EXACT A DUE PUNISHMENT OF THE PHILISTINES
4836-26485-0087 THAT IF ANY ONE PUT A STOP TO HIS SLAUGHTER OF THE ENEMY AND FELL ON EATING AND LEFT OFF THE SLAUGHTER OR THE PURSUIT BEFORE THE NIGHT CAME ON AND OBLIGED THEM SO TO DO
4836-26485-0088 NOW AFTER SAUL HAD DENOUNCED THIS CURSE
4836-26485-0089 SAUL'S SON WHO DID NOT HEAR HIS FATHER DENOUNCE THAT CURSE NOR HEAR OF THE APPROBATION THE MULTITUDE GAVE TO IT BROKE OFF A PIECE OF A HONEY COMB AND ATE PART OF IT
4836-26485-0090 BUT IN THE MEAN TIME HE WAS INFORMED WITH WHAT A CURSE HIS FATHER HAD FORBIDDEN THEM TO TASTE ANY THING BEFORE SUN SETTING SO HE LEFT OFF EATING AND SAID HIS FATHER HAD NOT DONE WELL IN THIS PROHIBITION
4836-26485-0091 BECAUSE HAD THEY TAKEN SOME FOOD THEY HAD PURSUED THE ENEMY WITH GREATER RIGOR AND ALACRITY AND HAD BOTH TAKEN AND SLAIN
4836-26485-0092 THEY HAD SLAIN MANY TEN THOUSANDS OF THE PHILISTINES THEY FELL UPON SPOILING THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES BUT NOT TILL LATE IN THE EVENING THEY ALSO TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF PREY AND CATTLE AND KILLED THEM AND ATE THEM WITH THEIR BLOOD
4836-26485-0093 THIS WAS TOLD TO THE KING BY THE SCRIBES THAT THE MULTITUDE WERE SINNING AGAINST GOD AS THEY SACRIFICED AND WERE EATING BEFORE THE BLOOD WAS WELL WASHED AWAY AND THE FLESH WAS MADE CLEAN THEN DID SAUL GIVE ORDER THAT A GREAT STONE SHOULD BE ROLLED INTO THE MIDST OF THEM
4836-26485-0094 AND HE MADE PROCLAMATION THAT THEY SHOULD KILL THEIR SACRIFICES UPON IT AND NOT FEED UPON THE FLESH WITH THE BLOOD FOR THAT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO GOD AND WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE DID AS THE KING COMMANDED THEM SAUL ERECTED AN ALTAR THERE
4836-26485-0095 AND WHEN THE SOLDIERS WERE NOT UNWILLING TO FOLLOW HIM BUT INDEED SHOWED GREAT READINESS TO DO AS HE COMMANDED THEM THE KING CALLED AHITUB THE HIGH PRIEST AND ENJOINED HIM TO KNOW OF GOD WHETHER HE WOULD GRANT THEM THE FAVOR AND PERMISSION
4836-26485-0096 TO GO AGAINST THE ENEMY'S CAMP IN ORDER TO DESTROY THOSE THAT WERE IN IT AND WHEN THE PRIEST SAID THAT GOD DID NOT GIVE ANY ANSWER SAUL REPLIED AND NOT WITHOUT SOME CAUSE DOES GOD REFUSE TO ANSWER WHAT WE INQUIRE OF HIM
4836-26485-0097 WHILE YET A LITTLE WHILE AGO HE DECLARED TO US ALL THAT WE DESIRED BEFOREHAND AND EVEN PREVENTED US IN HIS ANSWER TO BE SURE THERE IS SOME SIN AGAINST HIM THAT IS CONCEALED FROM US
4836-26485-0098 WHICH IS THE OCCASION OF HIS SILENCE NOW I SWEAR BY HIM HIMSELF THAT THOUGH HE THAT HATH COMMITTED THIS SIN SHOULD PROVE TO BE MY OWN SON JONATHAN I WILL SLAY HIM AND BY THAT MEANS WILL APPEASE THE ANGER OF GOD AGAINST US
4836-26485-0099 AND THAT IN THE VERY SAME MANNER AS IF I WERE TO PUNISH A STRANGER AND ONE NOT AT ALL RELATED TO ME FOR THE SAME OFFENSE SO WHEN THE MULTITUDE CRIED OUT TO HIM SO TO DO HE PRESENTLY SET ALL THE REST ON ONE SIDE
4836-26485-0100 AND HE AND HIS SON STOOD ON THE OTHER SIDE AND HE SOUGHT TO DISCOVER THE OFFENDER BY LOT NOW THE LOT APPEARED TO FALL UPON JONATHAN HIMSELF SO WHEN HE WAS ASKED BY HIS FATHER WHAT SIN HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF
4836-26485-0101 AND WHAT HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE THAT MIGHT BE ESTEEMED INSTANCES OF GUILT OR PROFANENESS HIS ANSWER WAS THIS O FATHER I HAVE DONE NOTHING MORE THAN THAT YESTERDAY WITHOUT
4836-26485-0102 KNOWING OF THE CURSE AND OATH THOU HADST DENOUNCED WHILE I WAS IN PURSUIT OF THE ENEMY I TASTED OF A HONEY COMB BUT SAUL SWARE THAT HE WOULD SLAY HIM AND PREFER THE OBSERVATION OF HIS OATH BEFORE ALL THE TIES OF BIRTH AND OF NATURE
4836-26485-0103 AND JONATHAN WAS NOT DISMAYED AT THIS THREATENING OF DEATH BUT OFFERING HIMSELF TO IT GENEROUSLY AND UNDAUNTEDLY HE SAID NOR DO I DESIRE YOU FATHER TO SPARE ME DEATH WILL BE TO ME VERY ACCEPTABLE
4836-26485-0104 WHEN IT PROCEEDS FROM THY PIETY AND AFTER A GLORIOUS VICTORY FOR IT IS THE GREATEST CONSOLATION TO ME THAT I LEAVE THE HEBREWS VICTORIOUS OVER THE PHILISTINES
4836-26485-0105 HEREUPON ALL THE PEOPLE WERE VERY SORRY AND GREATLY AFFLICTED FOR JONATHAN
4836-26485-0106 WHO WAS THE AUTHOR OF THEIR VICTORY BY WHICH MEANS THEY SNATCHED HIM OUT OF THE DANGER HE WAS IN FROM HIS FATHER'S CURSE
4836-26485-0107 HAVING SLAIN ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND OF THE ENEMY RETURNED HOME TO HIS OWN CITY AND REIGNED HAPPILY AND HE ALSO FOUGHT AGAINST THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS AND SUBDUED THE AMMONITES AND MOABITES AND PHILISTINES AND EDOMITES AND AMALEKITES
4836-26485-0108 AS ALSO THE KING OF ZOBAH HE HAD THREE MALE CHILDREN JONATHAN
4836-26485-0109 HIS DAUGHTERS HE HAD ALSO ABNER HIS UNCLE'S SON FOR THE CAPTAIN OF HIS HOST THAT UNCLE'S NAME WAS NER NOW NER AND KISH THE FATHER OF SAUL WERE BROTHERS SAUL HAD ALSO A GREAT MANY CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN
4836-26485-0110 AND AGAINST WHOMSOEVER HE MADE WAR HE RETURNED CONQUEROR AND ADVANCED THE AFFAIRS OF THE HEBREWS TO A GREAT DEGREE OF SUCCESS AND PROSPERITY AND MADE THEM SUPERIOR TO OTHER NATIONS
