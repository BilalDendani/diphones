9023-296468-0000 LET US SEE THOUGH BEFORE WE TRY OUR ANECDOTES WHAT IS KNOWN OF THE CAT'S PECULIARITIES I RATHER LIKE THIS QUAINT DESCRIPTION OF THE DOMESTIC PUSSY WHICH OCCURS IN AN OLD HERALDIC BOOK JOHN BOSSEWELL'S WORKES OF ARMORIE PUBLISHED IN FIFTEEN NINETY SEVEN
9023-296468-0001 THE FIELD IS OF THE SAPHIRE ON A CHIEF PEARLE A MASION CRUIEVES THIS BEASTE IS CALLED A MASION FOR THAT HE IS ENIMIE TO MYSE AND RATTES HE IS SLYE AND WITTIE AND SEETH SO SHARPELY THAT HE OVERCOMMETH DARKNESS OF THE NIGHTE
9023-296468-0002 IN SHAPE OF BODY HE IS LIKE UNTO A LEOPARDE
9023-296468-0003 HE DOTH DELIGHTE THAT HE ENJOYETH HIS LIBERTIE AND IN HIS YOUTH HE IS SWIFTE PLYANTE AND MERYE HE MAKETH A RUFULL NOYSE AND A GASTEFULLE WHEN HE PROFERETH TO FIGHTE WITH ANOTHER HE IS A CRUELL BEASTE WHEN HE IS WILDE
9023-296468-0004 AND FALLETH ON HIS OWNE FEETE FROM MOSTE HIGHE PLACES AND NEVER IS HURT THEREWITH WHEN HE HATHE A FAYRE SKINNE HE IS AS IT WERE PROUDE THEREOF AND THEN HE GOETHE MUCHE ABOUTE TO BE SEENE IT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED THAT A CAT'S SCRATCH IS VENOMOUS
9023-296468-0005 BECAUSE A LACERATED WOUND OFTENER FESTERS THAN A SMOOTH CUT FROM A SHARP KNIFE IT IS ERRONEOUSLY SAID THAT CATS FEEL A CUTANEOUS IRRITATION AT THE APPROACH OF RAIN AND OFFER SENSIBLE EVIDENCE OF UNEASINESS ALLUSION MAY BE FOUND TO THIS IN THOMSON'S SEASONS
9023-296468-0006 VIRGIL HAS ALSO MADE THE SUBJECT A THEME FOR POETIC ALLUSION THE CHINESE LOOK INTO THEIR CAT'S EYES TO KNOW WHAT O'CLOCK IT IS
9023-296468-0007 I HAVE NOTICED THIS OFTEN MYSELF AND HAVE SEEN THEM RUSH ABOUT IN A HALF WILD STATE JUST BEFORE WINDY WEATHER I THINK IT IS WHEN THE WIND IS RISING THAT THEY ARE MOST AFFECTED IT IS STATED IN A JAPANESE BOOK THAT THE TIP OF A CAT'S NOSE IS ALWAYS COLD
9023-296468-0008 EXCEPT ON THE DAY CORRESPONDING WITH OUR MIDSUMMER DAY THIS IS A QUESTION I CANNOT SAY I HAVE GONE INTO DEEPLY I KNOW HOWEVER THAT CATS ALWAYS HAVE A WARM NOSE WHEN THEY FIRST AWAKEN FROM SLEEP ALL CATS ARE FOND OF WARMTH
9023-296468-0009 I KNEW ONE WHICH USED TO OPEN AN OVEN DOOR AFTER THE KITCHEN FIRE WAS OUT AND CREEP INTO THE OVEN ONE DAY THE SERVANT SHUT THE DOOR NOT NOTICING THE CAT WAS INSIDE AND LIGHTED THE FIRE FOR A LONG WHILE SHE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHENCE CAME THE SOUNDS OF ITS CRYING AND SCRATCHING
9023-296468-0010 BUT FORTUNATELY MADE THE DISCOVERY IN TIME TO SAVE ITS LIFE A CAT'S LOVE OF THE SUNSHINE IS WELL KNOWN AND PERHAPS THIS STORY MAY NOT BE UNFAMILIAR TO THE READER ONE BROILING HOT SUMMER'S DAY CHARLES JAMES FOX AND THE PRINCE OF WALES WERE LOUNGING UP SAINT JAMES'S STREET
9023-296468-0011 ALTHOUGH THE PRINCE MIGHT CHOOSE WHICH SIDE OF THE STREET HE THOUGHT FIT ON REACHING PICCADILLY IT TURNED OUT THAT FOX HAD SEEN THIRTEEN CATS AND THE PRINCE NONE THE PRINCE ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THIS APPARENT MIRACLE
9023-296468-0012 SAID FOX CHOSE OF COURSE THE SHADY SIDE OF THE WAY AS MOST AGREEABLE I KNEW THAT THE SUNNY SIDE WOULD BE LEFT FOR ME AND THAT CATS PREFER THE SUNSHINE CATS USUALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS FALL ON THEIR FEET BECAUSE OF THE FACILITY WITH WHICH THEY BALANCE THEMSELVES WHEN SPRINGING FROM A HEIGHT
9023-296468-0013 WHICH POWER OF BALANCING IS IN SOME DEGREE PRODUCED BY THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE HEEL THE BONES OF WHICH HAVE NO FEWER THAN FOUR JOINTS CATS ALIGHT SOFTLY ON THEIR FEET BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOT IS A LARGE BALL OR PAD IN FIVE PARTS FORMED OF AN ELASTIC SUBSTANCE AND AT THE BASE OF EACH TOE IS A SIMILAR PAD
9023-296468-0014 THIS SO CHANGES THE POSITION OF THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY THAT THE BODY MAKES A HALF TURN IN THE AIR AND THE FEET BECOME LOWEST
9023-296468-0015 THERE IS A BREED OF TAIL LESS WHITE CATS IN THE ISLE OF MAN AND ALSO IN DEVONSHIRE THESE ARE NOT THE SORT OF ANIMALS WITH WHICH ON SHIPBOARD THE STOW AWAYS ARE MADE ACQUAINTED A GREAT MANY CATS IN THE ISLE OF MAN ARE SAID TO BE DEAF THUS AS DEAF AS A MANX CAT
9023-296468-0016 THERE IS AN IDEA THAT WHITE CATS WITH BLUE EYES ARE ALWAYS DEAF BUT A CORRESPONDENT OF NOTES AND QUERIES SAYS I AM MYSELF POSSESSED OF A WHITE CAT WHICH AT THE ADVANCED AGE OF UPWARDS OF SEVENTEEN YEARS STILL RETAINS ITS HEARING TO GREAT PERFECTION
9023-296468-0017 AND IS REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT AND DEVOTED MORE SO THAN CATS ARE USUALLY GIVEN CREDIT FOR ITS AFFECTION FOR PERSONS IS INDEED MORE LIKE THAT OF A DOG THAN OF A CAT IT IS A HALF BRED PERSIAN CAT AND ITS EYES ARE PERFECTLY BLUE
9023-296468-0018 WITH ROUND PUPILS NOT ELONGATED AS THOSE OF CATS USUALLY ARE IT OCCASIONALLY SUFFERS FROM IRRITATION IN THE EARS BUT THIS HAS NOT AT ALL RESULTED IN DEAFNESS DO YOU KNOW WHY CATS ALWAYS WASH THEMSELVES AFTER A MEAL
9023-296468-0019 BUT THE SPARROW FLEW AWAY THIS VEXED PUSSY EXTREMELY AND HE SAID AS LONG AS I LIVE I WILL EAT FIRST AND WASH MY FACE AFTERWARDS WHICH ALL CATS DO EVEN TO THIS DAY
9023-296468-0020 A FRENCH WRITER SAYS THE THREE ANIMALS THAT WASTE MOST TIME OVER THEIR TOILET ARE CATS FLIES AND WOMEN THE ATTITUDES AND MOTIONS OF A CAT ARE VERY GRACEFUL BECAUSE SHE IS FURNISHED WITH COLLAR BONES SHE CAN THEREFORE CARRY FOOD TO HER MOUTH LIKE A MONKEY
9023-296468-0021 CAN CLASP CAN CLIMB AND CAN STRIKE SIDEWAYS AND SEAT HERSELF AT A HEIGHT UPON A VERY NARROW SPACE THE LATERAL MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD IN CATS ARE NOT SO EXTENSIVE AS IN THE OWL BUT ARE NEVERTHELESS CONSIDERABLE
9023-296468-0022 A CAT CAN LOOK ROUND PRETTY FAR BEHIND IT WITHOUT MOVING ITS BODY WHICH MIGHT BE APT TO STARTLE ITS PREY THE SPINE OF THE CAT IS VERY FULL AND LOOSE IN ORDER THAT ALL ITS MOVEMENTS IN ALL POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE FREE AND UNRESTRAINED
9023-296468-0023 FOR THIS PURPOSE TOO ALL THE JOINTS WHICH CONNECT ITS BONES TOGETHER ARE EXTREMELY LOOSE AND FREE THUS THE CAT IS ENABLED TO GET THROUGH SMALL APERTURES TO LEAP FROM GREAT HEIGHTS AND EVEN TO FALL IN AN UNFAVOURABLE POSTURE WITH LITTLE OR NO INJURY TO ITSELF
9023-296468-0024 ITS EARS ARE NOT SO MOVEABLE AS THOSE OF SOME OTHER ANIMALS BUT ARE MORE SO THAN IN VERY MANY ANIMALS THE SHAPE OF THE EXTERNAL EAR OR RATHER CARTILAGINOUS PORTION IS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO INTERCEPT SOUNDS
9023-296468-0025 THE NATURAL POSTURE IS FORWARD AND OUTWARD SO AS TO CATCH SOUNDS PROCEEDING FROM THE FRONT AND SIDES THE UPPER HALF HOWEVER IS MOVEABLE AND BY MEANS OF A THIN LAYER OF MUSCULAR FIBRES IT IS MADE TO CURVE BACKWARDS AND RECEIVE SOUNDS FROM THE REAR
9023-296468-0026 ALTHOUGH A CAT CANNOT LICK ITS FACE AND HEAD IT NEVERTHELESS CLEANS THESE PARTS THOROUGHLY IN FACT AS WE OFTEN OBSERVE A CAT LICKS ITS RIGHT PAW FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN BRUSHES DOWN THE CORRESPONDING SIDE OF THE HEAD AND FACE AND WHEN THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED IT DOES THE SAME WITH THE OTHER PAW AND CORRESPONDING SIDE
9023-296468-0027 A MAY KITTEN MAKES A DIRTY CAT IS A PIECE OF HUNTINGDONSHIRE FOLK LORE SAYS MISTER CUTHBERT BEDE QUOTED TO ME IN ORDER TO DETER ME FROM KEEPING A KITTEN THAT HAD BEEN BORN IN MAY DOCTOR TURTON SAYS
9023-296468-0028 THE CAT HAS A MORE VOLUMINOUS AND EXPRESSIVE VOCABULARY THAN ANY OTHER BRUTE THE SHORT TWITTER OF COMPLACENCY AND AFFECTION THE PURR OF TRANQUILITY AND PLEASURE THE MEW OF DISTRESS THE GROWL OF ANGER AND THE HORRIBLE WAILING OF PAIN
9023-296468-0029 FOR MYSELF I SELDOM HEAR A CATAWAULING WITHOUT THINKING OF THAT DROLL PICTURE IN PUNCH OF THE OLD LADY SITTING UP IN BED AND PRICKING UP HER EARS TO THE MUSIC OF A MEWING CAT
9023-296468-0030 I LOVE TO LISTEN TO EM IT MAY BE FANCY BUT SOMEHOW THEY DON'T SEEM TO PLAY SO SWEETLY AS THEY DID WHEN I WAS A GIRL
9023-296468-0031 FEW EVEN AMONGST PUSSY'S MOST ARDENT ADMIRERS WHO POSSESS THE FACULTY OF HEARING AND HAVE HEARD THE MUSIC OF CATS WOULD DESIRE THE CONTINUANCE OF THEIR SWEET VOICES YET A CONCERT WAS EXHIBITED AT PARIS WHEREIN CATS WERE THE PERFORMERS
9023-296468-0032 THEY WERE PLACED IN ROWS AND A MONKEY BEAT TIME TO THEM AS THE CATS MEWED AND THE HISTORIAN OF THE FACTS RELATES THAT THE DIVERSITY OF THE TONES WHICH THEY EMITTED PRODUCED A VERY LUDICROUS EFFECT
9023-296468-0033 THIS EXHIBITION WAS ANNOUNCED TO THE PARISIAN PUBLIC BY THE TITLE OF CONCERT MIAULANT THIS WOULD SEEM TO PROVE THAT CATS MAY BE TAUGHT TRICKS WHICH IS NOT GENERALLY BELIEVED BUT IS NEVERTHELESS THE CASE
9023-296468-0034 IN POOL'S TWISTS AND TURNS ABOUT THE STREETS OF LONDON MENTION IS MADE OF A POOR HALF NAKED BOY STRUMMING A VIOLIN WHILE ANOTHER URCHIN WITH A WHIP MAKES TWO HALF STARVED CATS GO THROUGH NUMEROUS FEATS OF AGILITY
9023-296468-0035 DE ROGET SAYS THAT IN ANIMALS THAT GRAZE AND KEEP THEIR HEADS FOR A LONG TIME IN A DEPENDENT POSITION THE DANGER FROM AN EXCESSIVE IMPETUS IN THE BLOOD FLOWING TOWARDS THE HEAD IS MUCH GREATER THAN IN OTHER ANIMALS AND WE FIND THAT AN EXTRAORDINARY PROVISION IS MADE TO OBVIATE THIS DANGER
9023-296468-0036 THE ARTERIES WHICH SUPPLY THE BRAIN ON THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE BASIS OF THE SKULL SUDDENLY DIVIDE INTO A GREAT NUMBER OF MINUTE BRANCHES FORMING A COMPLICATED NETWORK OF VESSELS AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH ON THE WELL KNOWN PRINCIPLE OF HYDRAULICS MUST GREATLY CHECK THE VELOCITY OF THE BLOOD CONDUCTED THROUGH THEM
9023-296468-0037 IS EVIDENT FROM THE BRANCHES AFTERWARDS UNITING INTO LARGER TRUNKS WHEN THEY HAVE ENTERED THE BRAIN THROUGH THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH THEY ARE THEN DISTRIBUTED EXACTLY AS IN OTHER ANIMALS WHERE NO SUCH PREVIOUS SUBDIVISION TAKES PLACE
9023-296468-0038 BUT SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE IN THE CAT
9023-296468-0039 THE RETINA OR EXPANSION OF THE OPTIC NERVE IS MOST SENSITIVE TO THE STIMULUS OF LIGHT HENCE A WELL MARKED CILIARY MUSCLE CONTRACTS THE PUPIL TO A MERE VERTICAL FISSURE DURING THE DAY WHILE IN THE DARK THE PUPIL DILATES ENORMOUSLY AND LETS IN AS MUCH LIGHT AS POSSIBLE
9023-296468-0040 BUT EVEN THIS WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT FOR CATS HAVE TO LOOK FOR THEIR PREY IN HOLES CELLARS AND OTHER PLACES WHERE LITTLE OR NO LIGHT CAN PENETRATE HENCE THE CAT IS FURNISHED WITH A BRIGHT METAL LIKE LUSTROUS MEMBRANE CALLED THE TAPETUM WHICH LINES PART OF THE HOLLOW GLOBE OF THE EYE
9023-296468-0041 AND SHEDS CONSIDERABLE LIGHT ON THE IMAGE OF AN OBJECT THROWN ON THE RETINA THIS MEMBRANE IS WE ARE TOLD COMMON TO ALL VERTEBRATED ANIMALS BUT IS ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL AND LUSTROUS IN NOCTURNAL ANIMALS THE HERBIVORA SUCH AS THE OX AND SHEEP HAVE THE TAPETUM OF THE FINEST ENAMELLED GREEN COLOUR
9023-296468-0042 PROVIDED PROBABLY TO SUIT THE NATURE OF THEIR FOOD WHICH IS GREEN THE SUBJECT HOWEVER OF THE VARIOUS COLOURS OF THE TAPETUM IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD
9023-296468-0043 THE SENSIBILITY OF THE RETINA IN CATS IS SO GREAT THAT NEITHER THE CONTRACTIONS OF THE PUPIL NOR THE CLOSING OF THE EYE LIDS WOULD ALONE AFFORD THEM SUFFICIENT PROTECTION FROM THE ACTION OF THE LIGHT HENCE IN COMMON WITH MOST ANIMALS THE CAT IS FURNISHED WITH A NICTITATING MEMBRANE
9023-296468-0044 WHICH IS IN FACT A THIRD EYELID SLIDING OVER THE TRANSPARENT CORNEA BENEATH THE COMMON EYELIDS THIS MEMBRANE IS NOT ALTOGETHER OPAQUE BUT TRANSLUCENT ALLOWING LIGHT TO FALL ON THE RETINA AND ACTING AS IT WERE LIKE A SHADE
9023-296468-0045 WHEN THESE RAYS REACH THE OBSERVER DIRECT HE SEES THE LAMPS OR LUMINIFEROUS BODIES THEMSELVES BUT WHEN HE IS OUT OF THEIR DIRECT SIGHT THE BRIGHTNESS OF THEIR ILLUMINATION ONLY BECOMES APPARENT THROUGH THE RAYS BEING COLLECTED AND REFLECTED BY SOME APPROPRIATE SUBSTANCE
9023-296468-0046 THE CORNEA OF THE EYE OF THE CAT AND OF MANY OTHER ANIMALS HAS A GREAT POWER OF CONCENTRATING THE RAYS AND REFLECTING THEM THROUGH THE PUPIL PROFESSOR BOHN AT LEIPSIC MADE EXPERIMENTS PROVING THAT WHEN THE EXTERNAL LIGHT IS WHOLLY EXCLUDED NONE CAN BE SEEN IN THE CAT'S EYE
9023-296468-0047 FOR THE SAME REASON THE ANIMAL BY A CHANGE OF POSTURE OR OTHER MEANS INTERCEPTING THE RAYS IMMEDIATELY DEPRIVES THE OBSERVER OF ALL LIGHT OTHERWISE EXISTING IN OR PERMEATING THE ROOM IN THIS ACTION WHEN THE IRIS OF THE EYE IS COMPLETELY OPEN THE DEGREE OF BRILLIANCY IS THE GREATEST
9023-296468-0048 BUT WHEN THE IRIS IS PARTLY CONTRACTED WHICH IT ALWAYS IS WHEN THE EXTERNAL LIGHT OR THE LIGHT IN THE ROOM IS INCREASED THEN THE ILLUMINATION IS MORE OBSCURE THE INTERNAL MOTIONS OF THE ANIMALS HAVE ALSO GREAT INFLUENCE OVER THIS LUMINOUS APPEARANCE BY THE CONTRACTION AND RELAXATION OF THE IRIS DEPENDENT UPON THEM
9023-296468-0049 WHEN THE ANIMAL IS ALARMED OR FIRST DISTURBED IT NATURALLY DILATES THE PUPIL AND THE EYE GLARES WHEN IT IS APPEASED OR COMPOSED THE PUPIL CONTRACTS AND THE LIGHT IN THE EYE IS NO LONGER SEEN
9023-296468-0050 A GERMAN SAVANT SAYS THAT AT THE END OF EACH HAIR OF A CAT'S WHISKERS IS A SORT OF BULB OF NERVOUS SUBSTANCE WHICH CONVERTS IT INTO A MOST SENSITIVE FEELER THE WHISKERS ARE OF THE GREATEST USE TO HER WHEN HUNTING IN THE DARK
9023-296468-0051 THE NERVOUS BULBS AT THE ENDS OF A LION'S WHISKERS ARE AS LARGE AS A SMALL PEA BUT AN ENGLISH WRITER DIFFERS FROM HIM THUS EVERY ONE MUST HAVE OBSERVED WHAT ARE USUALLY CALLED THE WHISKERS ON A CAT'S UPPER LIP THE USE OF THESE IN A STATE OF NATURE IS VERY IMPORTANT
9023-296468-0052 THEY ARE ORGANS OF TOUCH THEY ARE ATTACHED TO A BED OF CLOSE GLANDS UNDER THE SKIN AND EACH OF THESE LONG AND STIFF HAIRS IS CONNECTED WITH THE NERVES OF THE LIP THE SLIGHTEST CONTACT OF THESE WHISKERS WITH ANY SURROUNDING OBJECT IS THUS FELT MOST DISTINCTLY BY THE ANIMAL ALTHOUGH THE HAIRS ARE OF THEMSELVES INSENSIBLE
9023-296468-0053 THEY STAND OUT ON EACH SIDE IN THE LION AS WELL AS IN THE COMMON CAT SO THAT FROM POINT TO POINT THEY ARE EQUAL IN WIDTH TO THE ANIMAL'S BODY IF WE IMAGINE THEREFORE A LION STEALING THROUGH A COVERT OF WOOD IN AN IMPERFECT LIGHT
9023-296468-0054 WE SHALL AT ONCE SEE THE USE OF THESE LONG HAIRS THEY INDICATE TO HIM THROUGH THE NICEST FEELING ANY OBSTACLE WHICH MAY PRESENT ITSELF TO THE PASSAGE OF THE BODY THEY PREVENT THE RUSTLE OF BOUGHS AND LEAVES WHICH WOULD GIVE WARNING TO HIS PREY IF HE WERE TO ATTEMPT TO PASS THROUGH TOO DENSE A BUSH
9023-296468-0055 AND THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SOFT CUSHIONS OF HIS FEET AND THE FUR UPON WHICH HE TREADS THE RETRACTABLE CLAWS NEVER COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE GROUND ENABLE HIM TO MOVE TOWARDS HIS VICTIM WITH A STILLNESS EVEN GREATER THAN THAT OF THE SNAKE WHO CREEPS ALONG THE GRASS AND IS NOT PERCEIVED TILL HE IS COILED ROUND HIS PREY
9023-296468-0056 BLACK CATS ESPECIALLY ARE SAID TO BE HIGHLY CHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY WHICH WHEN THE ANIMAL IS IRRITATED IS EASILY VISIBLE IN THE DARK HERE ARE DIRECTIONS I HAVE FOR PRODUCING THE EFFECT LAY ONE HAND UPON THE CAT'S THROAT AND SLIGHTLY PRESS ITS SHOULDER BONES
9023-296468-0057 IF THE OTHER HAND BE DRAWN GENTLY ALONG ITS BACK ELECTRIC SHOCKS WILL BE FELT IN THE HAND UPON THE CAT'S THROAT IF THE TIPS OF THE EARS BE TOUCHED AFTER THE BACK HAS BEEN RUBBED SHOCKS OF ELECTRICITY MAY ALSO BE FELT OR THEY MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE FOOT
9023-296468-0058 LAY THE ANIMAL UPON YOUR KNEES AND APPLY THE RIGHT HAND TO THE BACK THE LEFT FORE PAW RESTING ON THE PALM OF YOUR LEFT HAND
9023-296468-0059 AND BY THIS MEANS BRING YOUR FORE FINGER IN CONTACT WITH ONE OF THE BONES OF THE LEG WHERE IT JOINS THE PAW WHEN FROM THE KNOB OR END OF THIS BONE THE FINGER SLIGHTLY PRESSING ON IT YOU MAY FEEL DISTINCTLY SUCCESSIVE SHOCKS SIMILAR TO THOSE OBTAINED FROM THE EARS
9023-296468-0060 THE REVEREND MISTER WOOD EXPRESSES AN OPINION THAT ON ACCOUNT OF THE SUPERABUNDANCE OF ELECTRICITY WHICH IS DEVELOPED IN THE CAT THE ANIMAL IS FOUND VERY USEFUL TO PARALYSED PERSONS WHO INSTINCTIVELY ENCOURAGE ITS APPROACH AND FROM THE TOUCH DERIVE SOME BENEFIT
9023-296468-0061 THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM RHEUMATISM OFTEN FIND THE PRESENCE OF A CAT ALLEVIATE THEIR SUFFERINGS
9023-296468-0062 THAT IF A HAIR OF HER MISTRESS'S HEAD WERE LAID UPON THE ANIMAL'S BACK
9023-296468-0063 AND ROLLING ON THE FLOOR WOULD STRIVE TO FREE HERSELF FROM THE OBJECT OF HER FEARS THE POINTING OF A FINGER AT HER SIDE AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A FOOT WOULD CAUSE HER FUR TO BRISTLE UP AND THROW HER INTO A VIOLENT TREMOUR IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FONDNESS OF CATS FOR FISH
9023-296468-0064 AS NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN THEM AN APPETITE WHICH WITH THEIR GREAT ANTIPATHY TO WATER THEY CAN RARELY GRATIFY UNASSISTED MANY INSTANCES HAVE HOWEVER BEEN RECORDED OF CATS CATCHING FISH
9023-296468-0065 A MISTER MOODY OF SESMOND NEAR NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE HAD A CAT IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE WHICH HAD BEEN IN HIS POSSESSION FOR SOME YEARS
9023-296468-0066 AND FREQUENTLY BROUGHT THEM HOME ALIVE BESIDES MINNOWS AND EELS SHE OCCASIONALLY CARRIED HOME PILCHARDS ONE OF WHICH ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG WAS ONCE FOUND IN HER POSSESSION SHE ALSO CONTRIVED TO TEACH A NEIGHBOUR'S CAT TO FISH
9023-296468-0067 BEING IN THE CONSTANT HABIT OF DIVING INTO THE SEA AND BRINGING UP THE FISH ALIVE IN HER MOUTH AND DEPOSITING THEM IN THE GUARD ROOM FOR THE USE OF THE SAILORS SHE IS NOW SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HAS LONG BEEN A USEFUL CATERER IT IS SUPPOSED THAT HER PURSUIT OF THE WATER RATS FIRST TAUGHT HER TO VENTURE INTO THE WATER
9023-296468-0068 TO WHICH IT IS WELL KNOWN PUSS HAS A NATURAL AVERSION SHE IS NOW AS FOND OF THE WATER AS A NEWFOUNDLAND DOG AND TAKES HER REGULAR PEREGRINATIONS ALONG THE ROCKS AT ITS EDGE LOOKING OUT FOR HER GAME READY TO DIVE FOR IT AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE TALKING OF THE CAT'S FONDNESS FOR FISH I SHOULD HOWEVER MENTION
9023-296468-0069 BUT IT IS NOT SUCH A RARITY AS WE ARE LED TO BELIEVE ON THE CONTRARY SPECIMENS ARE FREQUENTLY OFFERED FOR SALE AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS IT IS ANOTHER GREAT MISTAKE TO THINK THAT CATS HAVE FLEAS THE INSECT INFESTING A HALF GROWN CAT DOES NOT LEAP LIKE A FLEA
9023-296468-0070 THE SHE CAT GOES WITH YOUNG FROM FIFTY FIVE TO FIFTY EIGHT DAYS AND GENERALLY HAS FOUR OR FIVE KITTENS AT A LITTER WHEN BORN THEY ARE BLIND AND DEAF LIKE PUPPIES THEY GET THEIR SIGHT IN ABOUT NINE DAYS AND ARE ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE REACHING FULL GROWTH
9023-296468-0071 THOSE WHO WISH THEIR CATS TO CATCH MICE I SHOULD ADVISE NOT TO NEGLECT THE CAT'S FOOD A STARVED CAT MAKES A VERY BAD MOUSER BEING TOO EAGER AND HUNGRY FOR THE WORK IT TRIES TO POUNCE UPON ITS PREY BEFORE THE PROPER TIME COMES A GOOD MOUSER DOES NOT EAT THE MOUSE
9023-296468-0072 I HAVE A BLACK CAT WHICH IS VERY FAT BUT A WONDERFUL HUNTSMAN AND SURPRISINGLY NIMBLE AT THE CHASE HE IS ALSO AS PROUD OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AS A HUMAN SPORTSMAN AND BRINGS ME EVERY HEAD OF GAME HE CATCHES SOMETIMES IF I HAVE BEEN OUT WHEN HE HAS CAUGHT HIS MOUSE
9023-296468-0073 HE HAS GONE ALL OVER THE HOUSE IN SEARCH OF ME AND AT LAST HAS TAKEN HIS SEAT BY THE FIRESIDE OR OUT IN THE GARDEN AND NURSED THE TROPHY OF HIS PROWESS UNTIL I RETURNED
9023-296468-0074 BUT ONCE HAVING LAID IT AT MY FEET AND HAD HIS HEAD SCRATCHED IN RETURN HIS INTEREST IN THE MATTER SEEMED TO CEASE AND HE WENT AWAY WITHOUT AGAIN ATTEMPTING TO TOUCH IT IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE HAD MADE ME A PRESENT OF THE GAME AND AS WE SOMETIMES THINK WHEN WE MAKE ANYONE A PRESENT OF SOMETHING TO EAT IT WOULD BE MORE DELICATE FOR US TO GO AWAY IMMEDIATELY
9023-296468-0075 LEST IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED WE DESIRED TO BE ASKED TO STOP AND PARTAKE OF IT TOM THUS DEPARTED NO DOUBT WITH A SIMILAR IDEA NO EXPERIMENT SAYS AN INTELLIGENT WRITER CAN BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THAT OF SETTING A KITTEN FOR THE FIRST TIME BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS THE ANIMAL APPEARS SURPRISED AND PLEASED WITH THE REFLECTION
9023-296468-0076 AND AT LENGTH FINDING ITS EFFORTS FRUITLESS IT LOOKS BEHIND THE GLASS AND APPEARS HIGHLY ASTONISHED AT THE ABSENCE OF THE FIGURE IT AGAIN VIEWS ITSELF AND TRIES TO TOUCH THE IMAGE WITH ITS FOOT SUDDENLY LOOKING AT INTERVALS BEHIND THE GLASS
