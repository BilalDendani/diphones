5460-18031-0000 TRUE GREATNESS IS OFTEN UNRECOGNIZED THAT IS SURE
5460-18031-0001 I WENT OUT TO WRITE THE LIFE OF GENERAL GARFIELD AND A NEIGHBOR
5460-18031-0002 AND AS THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD AROUND THE FRONT DOOR TOOK ME AROUND TO GENERAL GARFIELD'S BACK DOOR AND SHOUTED JIM JIM AND VERY SOON JIM CAME TO THE DOOR AND LET ME IN AND
5460-18031-0003 I WROTE THE BIOGRAPHY OF ONE OF THE GRANDEST MEN OF THE NATION AND YET HE WAS JUST THE SAME OLD JIM TO HIS NEIGHBOR IF YOU KNOW A GREAT MAN IN PHILADELPHIA AND YOU SHOULD MEET HIM TO MORROW YOU WOULD SAY
5460-18031-0004 HOW ARE YOU SAM OR GOOD MORNING JIM OF COURSE YOU WOULD THAT IS JUST WHAT YOU WOULD DO
5460-18031-0005 I WENT INTO THE WAITING ROOM AND SAT DOWN WITH A LOT OF OTHERS ON THE BENCHES AND THE SECRETARY ASKED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO TELL HIM WHAT THEY WANTED AFTER THE SECRETARY HAD BEEN THROUGH THE LINE HE WENT IN AND
5460-18031-0006 THEN CAME BACK TO THE DOOR AND MOTIONED FOR ME I WENT UP TO THAT ANTEROOM AND THE SECRETARY SAID
5460-18031-0007 I NEVER WAS SO TAKEN ABACK FRIENDS IN ALL MY LIFE NEVER

5460-18031-0009 WHATSOEVER HE HAD TO DO AT ALL HE PUT HIS WHOLE MIND INTO IT AND HELD IT ALL THERE UNTIL THAT WAS ALL DONE THAT MAKES MEN GREAT ALMOST ANYWHERE
5460-18031-0010 AND DID NOT LOOK UP AT ME AND I SAT THERE TREMBLING FINALLY WHEN HE HAD PUT THE STRING AROUND HIS PAPERS HE PUSHED THEM OVER TO ONE SIDE
5460-18031-0011 THEN TAD AND I ARE GOING OUT TO SPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS I HAVE BOUGHT A FARM OUT THERE AND
5460-18031-0012 THEN HE ASKED ME WERE YOU BROUGHT UP ON A FARM I SAID YES IN THE BERKSHIRE HILLS OF MASSACHUSETTS HE THEN THREW HIS LEG OVER THE CORNER OF THE BIG CHAIR AND SAID I HAVE HEARD
5460-18031-0013 MANY A TIME EVER SINCE I WAS YOUNG THAT UP THERE IN THOSE HILLS YOU HAVE TO SHARPEN THE NOSES OF
5460-18031-0014 HE WAS SO FAMILIAR SO
5460-18031-0015 SO FARMER LIKE THAT I FELT RIGHT AT HOME WITH HIM AT ONCE HE THEN TOOK HOLD OF ANOTHER ROLL OF PAPER AND LOOKED UP AT ME AND SAID GOOD MORNING I TOOK THE HINT THEN AND GOT UP AND WENT OUT
5460-18031-0016 AFTER I HAD GOTTEN OUT I COULD NOT REALIZE I HAD SEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AT ALL
5460-18031-0017 BY THE COFFIN OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND WHEN I LOOKED AT THE UPTURNED FACE OF THE MURDERED PRESIDENT I FELT THEN
5460-18031-0018 THE GREATEST MEN THAT GOD EVER RAISED UP TO LEAD A NATION ON TO ULTIMATE LIBERTY YET HE WAS ONLY OLD ABE TO HIS NEIGHBORS
5460-18031-0019 WHEN THEY HAD THE SECOND FUNERAL I WAS INVITED AMONG OTHERS AND WENT OUT TO SEE THAT SAME COFFIN PUT BACK IN THE TOMB AT SPRINGFIELD AROUND THE TOMB STOOD LINCOLN'S OLD NEIGHBORS TO WHOM HE WAS JUST OLD ABE
5460-18031-0020 HE IS NOTHING BUT A PUFFED UP BALLOON HELD DOWN BY HIS BIG FEET THERE IS NO GREATNESS THERE WHO ARE THE GREAT MEN AND WOMEN
5460-18031-0021 NOT A GREAT INVENTOR OR GENIUS
5460-18031-0022 THE SAFETY PIN AND OUT OF THAT SAFETY PIN MADE THE FORTUNE OF ONE OF THE GREAT ARISTOCRATIC FAMILIES OF THIS NATION
5460-18031-0023 A POOR MAN IN MASSACHUSETTS WHO HAD WORKED IN THE NAIL WORKS WAS INJURED AT THIRTY EIGHT AND HE COULD EARN BUT LITTLE MONEY HE WAS EMPLOYED IN THE OFFICE TO RUB OUT THE MARKS ON THE BILLS MADE BY PENCIL MEMORANDUMS
5460-18031-0024 HE THEN TIED A PIECE OF RUBBER ON THE END OF A STICK AND WORKED IT LIKE A PLANE HIS LITTLE GIRL CAME AND SAID WHY YOU HAVE A PATENT HAVEN'T YOU THE FATHER SAID AFTERWARD
5460-18031-0025 MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME WHEN I TOOK THAT STICK AND PUT THE RUBBER ON THE END THAT THERE WAS A PATENT AND THAT WAS THE FIRST THOUGHT OF THAT
5460-18031-0026 HE WENT TO BOSTON AND APPLIED FOR HIS PATENT AND EVERY ONE OF YOU THAT HAS A RUBBER TIPPED PENCIL IN YOUR POCKET IS NOW PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE MILLIONAIRE NO CAPITAL NOT A PENNY DID HE INVEST IN IT
5460-18031-0027 ALL WAS INCOME ALL THE WAY UP INTO THE MILLIONS BUT LET ME HASTEN TO ONE OTHER GREATER THOUGHT SHOW ME THE GREAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO LIVE IN PHILADELPHIA A GENTLEMAN OVER THERE WILL GET UP AND SAY
5460-18031-0028 WE DON'T HAVE ANY GREAT MEN IN PHILADELPHIA THEY DON'T LIVE HERE THEY LIVE AWAY OFF IN ROME OR SAINT PETERSBURG OR LONDON OR MANAYUNK OR ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE IN OUR TOWN
5460-18031-0029 I HAVE COME NOW TO THE APEX OF MY THOUGHT I HAVE COME NOW TO THE HEART OF THE WHOLE MATTER AND TO THE CENTER OF MY STRUGGLE WHY ISN'T PHILADELPHIA A GREATER CITY IN ITS GREATER WEALTH
5460-18031-0030 WHY DOES NEW YORK EXCEL PHILADELPHIA PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE OF HER HARBOR WHY DO MANY OTHER CITIES OF THE UNITED STATES GET AHEAD OF PHILADELPHIA NOW
5460-18031-0031 THERE IS ONLY ONE ANSWER AND THAT IS BECAUSE OUR OWN PEOPLE TALK DOWN THEIR OWN CITY IF THERE EVER WAS A COMMUNITY ON EARTH THAT HAS TO BE FORCED AHEAD IT IS THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA
5460-18031-0032 IF WE ARE TO HAVE A BOULEVARD TALK IT DOWN IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BETTER SCHOOLS TALK THEM DOWN IF YOU WISH TO HAVE WISE LEGISLATION TALK IT DOWN TALK ALL THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS DOWN
5460-18031-0033 THAT IS THE ONLY GREAT WRONG THAT I CAN LAY AT THE FEET OF THE MAGNIFICENT PHILADELPHIA THAT HAS BEEN SO UNIVERSALLY KIND TO ME
5460-18031-0034 NEW YORK SAINT LOUIS AND SAN FRANCISCO DO
5460-18031-0035 TRUST IN GOD AND MAN AND BELIEVE IN THE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE RIGHT HERE NOT OVER IN NEW YORK OR BOSTON BUT
5460-18031-0036 GREATER LET US TALK UP OUR OWN CITY BUT THERE ARE TWO OTHER YOUNG MEN HERE TO NIGHT
5460-18031-0037 WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE GREAT
5460-18031-0038 THIS NATION WHERE THE PEOPLE RULE IS GOVERNED BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE AND SO LONG AS IT IS THEN THE OFFICE HOLDER IS BUT
5460-18031-0039 THE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE AND THE BIBLE SAYS THE SERVANT CANNOT BE GREATER THAN THE MASTER THE BIBLE SAYS HE THAT IS SENT
5460-18031-0040 THE PEOPLE RULE OR SHOULD RULE AND IF THEY DO WE DO NOT NEED THE GREATER MEN IN OFFICE IF THE GREAT MEN IN AMERICA TOOK OUR OFFICES WE WOULD CHANGE TO AN EMPIRE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS
5460-18031-0041 AND I AM GETTING OUT OF THE WAY ANYHOW I MAY WANT AN OFFICE BY AND BY MYSELF BUT
5460-18031-0042 I WANT TO SAY RIGHT HERE WHAT I SAY TO THE YOUNG MEN
5460-18031-0043 THAT IF YOU ONLY GET THE PRIVILEGE OF CASTING ONE VOTE YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING THAT IS WORTH WHILE UNLESS YOU CAN CONTROL MORE THAN ONE VOTE YOU WILL BE UNKNOWN AND YOUR INFLUENCE SO DISSIPATED AS PRACTICALLY NOT TO BE FELT
5460-18031-0044 IT IS GOVERNED BY INFLUENCE IT IS GOVERNED BY THE AMBITIONS AND THE ENTERPRISES WHICH CONTROL VOTES
5460-18031-0045 THERE ARE GOING TO BE GREAT MEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN PHILADELPHIA
5460-18031-0046 WHEN WHEN THERE COMES A GREAT WAR WHEN WE GET INTO DIFFICULTY THROUGH WATCHFUL WAITING IN MEXICO WHEN WE
5460-18031-0047 JAPAN OR CHINA OR NEW JERSEY OR SOME DISTANT COUNTRY THEN I WILL MARCH UP TO THE CANNON'S MOUTH I WILL SWEEP UP AMONG THE GLISTENING BAYONETS
5460-18031-0048 I WILL COME HOME WITH STARS ON MY SHOULDER AND HOLD EVERY OFFICE IN THE GIFT OF THE NATION AND I WILL BE GREAT NO YOU WON'T YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BE MADE GREAT
5460-18031-0049 SOME OF YOU SAW THE PROCESSION GO UP BROAD STREET I WAS AWAY BUT THE FAMILY WROTE TO ME THAT THE TALLY HO COACH WITH LIEUTENANT HOBSON UPON IT
5460-18031-0050 HURRAH FOR HOBSON AND IF I HAD BEEN THERE I WOULD HAVE YELLED TOO
5460-18031-0051 BUT SUPPOSE I GO INTO SCHOOL AND SAY WHO SUNK THE MERRIMAC AT SANTIAGO AND IF THE BOYS ANSWER ME HOBSON THEY WILL TELL ME SEVEN EIGHTHS OF A LIE
5460-18031-0052 THERE WERE SEVEN OTHER HEROES ON THAT STEAMER AND THEY BY VIRTUE OF THEIR POSITION
5460-18031-0053 WHILE HOBSON AS AN OFFICER MIGHT REASONABLY BE BEHIND THE SMOKE STACK YOU HAVE GATHERED IN THIS HOUSE YOUR MOST INTELLIGENT PEOPLE AND YET PERHAPS NOT ONE HERE
5460-18031-0054 CAN NAME THE OTHER SEVEN MEN WE OUGHT NOT TO SO TEACH HISTORY WE OUGHT TO TEACH THAT HOWEVER HUMBLE A MAN'S STATION MAY BE
5460-18031-0055 BUT WE DO NOT SO TEACH WE ARE NOW TEACHING EVERYWHERE THAT THE GENERALS DO ALL THE FIGHTING I REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE WAR I WENT DOWN TO SEE GENERAL ROBERT E LEE THAT
5460-18031-0056 MAGNIFICENT CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN OF WHOM BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH ARE NOW PROUD AS ONE OF OUR GREAT AMERICANS THE GENERAL TOLD ME ABOUT HIS SERVANT RASTUS WHO WAS AN ENLISTED COLORED SOLDIER
5460-18031-0057 HE CALLED HIM IN ONE DAY TO MAKE FUN OF HIM AND SAID RASTUS I HEAR THAT ALL THE REST OF YOUR COMPANY ARE KILLED AND WHY ARE YOU NOT KILLED RASTUS WINKED AT HIM AND SAID
5460-18031-0058 I REMEMBER ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION
5460-18031-0059 FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS I SHUT MY EYES SHUT THEM CLOSE AND LO I SEE THE FACES OF MY YOUTH
5460-18031-0060 YOUR HAIR IS NOT WHITE YOU ARE WORKING NIGHT AND DAY WITHOUT SEEMING EVER TO STOP YOU CAN'T BE OLD BUT WHEN I SHUT MY EYES LIKE ANY OTHER MAN OF MY YEARS
5460-18031-0061 OH THEN COME TROOPING BACK THE FACES OF THE LOVED AND LOST OF LONG AGO AND I KNOW WHATEVER MEN MAY SAY IT IS EVENING TIME
5460-18031-0062 I SHUT MY EYES NOW AND LOOK BACK TO MY NATIVE TOWN IN MASSACHUSETTS AND I SEE THE CATTLE SHOW GROUND ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP I CAN SEE THE HORSE SHEDS THERE
5460-18031-0063 SEE A GREAT ASSEMBLY OF PEOPLE TURNING OUT DRESSED RESPLENDENTLY AND I CAN SEE FLAGS FLYING AND HANDKERCHIEFS WAVING AND HEAR BANDS PLAYING I CAN SEE THAT COMPANY OF SOLDIERS THAT HAD RE ENLISTED MARCHING UP ON THAT CATTLE SHOW GROUND
5460-18031-0064 I WAS BUT A BOY BUT I WAS CAPTAIN OF THAT COMPANY AND PUFFED OUT WITH PRIDE A CAMBRIC NEEDLE WOULD HAVE BURST ME ALL TO PIECES THEN I THOUGHT IT WAS THE GREATEST EVENT THAT EVER CAME TO MAN ON EARTH
5460-18031-0065 IF YOU HAVE EVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A KING OR QUEEN YOU GO AND BE RECEIVED BY THE MAYOR
5460-18031-0066 TURNED DOWN INTO THE TOWN HALL THEN THEY SEATED MY SOLDIERS DOWN THE CENTER AISLE AND I SAT DOWN ON THE FRONT SEAT A GREAT ASSEMBLY OF PEOPLE A HUNDRED OR TWO CAME IN TO FILL THE TOWN HALL SO THAT THEY STOOD UP ALL AROUND
5460-18031-0067 THEN THE TOWN OFFICERS CAME IN AND FORMED A HALF CIRCLE
5460-18031-0068 HE WAS A MAN WHO HAD NEVER HELD OFFICE BEFORE BUT HE WAS A GOOD MAN AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE TOLD ME THAT I MIGHT USE THIS WITHOUT GIVING THEM OFFENSE HE WAS A GOOD MAN BUT HE THOUGHT AN OFFICE MADE A MAN GREAT
5460-18031-0069 ADJUSTED HIS POWERFUL SPECTACLES AND LOOKED AROUND WHEN HE SUDDENLY SPIED ME SITTING THERE ON THE FRONT SEAT HE CAME RIGHT FORWARD ON THE PLATFORM AND INVITED ME UP TO SIT WITH THE TOWN OFFICERS
5460-18031-0070 NO TOWN OFFICER EVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OF ME BEFORE I WENT TO WAR EXCEPT TO ADVISE THE TEACHER TO THRASH ME AND NOW I WAS INVITED UP ON THE STAND WITH THE TOWN OFFICERS OH MY
5460-18031-0071 THE TOWN MAYOR WAS THEN THE EMPEROR THE KING OF OUR DAY AND OUR TIME
5460-18031-0072 WHEN I HAD GOT SEATED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECTMEN AROSE AND CAME FORWARD TO THE TABLE AND WE ALL SUPPOSED HE WOULD INTRODUCE THE CONGREGATIONAL MINISTER WHO WAS THE ONLY ORATOR IN TOWN AND THAT HE WOULD GIVE THE ORATION TO THE RETURNING SOLDIERS
5460-18031-0073 HE HAD NEVER MADE A SPEECH IN HIS LIFE BUT HE FELL INTO THE SAME ERROR THAT HUNDREDS OF OTHER MEN HAVE FALLEN INTO IT SEEMS SO STRANGE THAT A MAN WON'T LEARN HE MUST SPEAK HIS PIECE AS A BOY
5460-18031-0074 IF HE IN TENDS TO BE AN ORATOR WHEN HE IS GROWN
5460-18031-0075 WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PASTURE WHERE HE HAD FRIGHTENED THE CATTLE
5460-18031-0076 HE ADJUSTED HIS SPECTACLES AND LEANED OVER IT FOR A MOMENT AND MARCHED BACK ON THAT PLATFORM AND THEN CAME FORWARD LIKE THIS TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
5460-18031-0077 HE MUST HAVE STUDIED THE SUBJECT A GREAT DEAL WHEN YOU COME TO THINK OF IT BECAUSE HE ASSUMED AN ELOCUTIONARY ATTITUDE HE RESTED HEAVILY UPON HIS LEFT HEEL
5460-18031-0078 SLIGHTLY ADVANCED THE RIGHT FOOT OPENED THE ORGANS OF SPEECH AND ADVANCED HIS RIGHT FOOT AT AN ANGLE OF FORTY FIVE AS HE STOOD IN THAT ELOCUTIONARY ATTITUDE FRIENDS
5460-18031-0079 DON'T YOU EXAGGERATE THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT I AM HERE FOR THE LESSON AND NOT FOR THE STORY AND THIS IS THE WAY IT WENT FELLOW CITIZENS
5460-18031-0080 AND THEN HE TREMBLED ALL OVER
5460-18031-0081 THEN HE GATHERED HIMSELF UP WITH CLENCHED FISTS AND CAME BACK
5460-18031-0082 WE ARE
5460-18031-0083 WE ARE WE ARE VERY HAPPY WE ARE VERY HAPPY WE ARE VERY HAPPY
5460-18031-0084 AND COME BACK AGAIN TO THEIR NATIVE TOWN WE ARE ESPECIALLY WE ARE ESPECIALLY
5460-18031-0085 WE ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED TO SEE WITH US TO DAY THIS YOUNG HERO THAT MEANT ME THIS YOUNG HERO WHO IN IMAGINATION FRIENDS REMEMBER HE SAID THAT IF HE HAD NOT SAID IN IMAGINATION
5460-18031-0086 THIS YOUNG HERO WHO IN IMAGINATION WE HAVE SEEN LEADING WE HAVE SEEN LEADING LEADING WE HAVE SEEN LEADING HIS TROOPS ON TO THE DEADLY BREACH WE HAVE SEEN HIS SHINING
5460-18031-0087 HIS SHINING HIS SHINING SWORD FLASHING FLASHING IN THE SUNLIGHT AS HE SHOUTED TO HIS TROOPS COME ON OH DEAR DEAR DEAR HOW LITTLE THAT GOOD MAN KNEW ABOUT WAR
5460-18031-0088 IF HE HAD KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT WAR AT ALL HE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN WHAT ANY OF MY
5460-18031-0089 EVER IN TIME OF DANGER TO GO AHEAD OF HIS MEN
5460-18031-0090 SHOUTING TO MY TROOPS COME ON I NEVER DID IT DO YOU SUPPOSE I WOULD GET IN FRONT OF MY MEN TO BE SHOT IN FRONT BY THE ENEMY AND IN THE BACK BY MY OWN MEN THAT IS NO PLACE FOR AN OFFICER
5460-18031-0091 THE PLACE FOR THE OFFICER IN ACTUAL BATTLE IS BEHIND THE LINE
5460-18031-0092 AND THE REBEL YELLS WERE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS AND SHOUTED OFFICERS TO THE REAR OFFICERS TO THE REAR THEN EVERY OFFICER GETS BEHIND THE LINE OF PRIVATE SOLDIERS AND THE HIGHER THE OFFICER'S RANK THE FARTHER BEHIND HE GOES
5460-18031-0093 NOT BECAUSE HE IS ANY THE LESS BRAVE BUT BECAUSE THE LAWS OF WAR REQUIRE THAT AND YET HE SHOUTED I WITH MY SHINING SWORD
5460-18031-0094 IN THAT HOUSE THERE SAT THE COMPANY OF MY SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED THAT BOY ACROSS THE CAROLINA RIVERS THAT HE MIGHT NOT WET HIS FEET SOME OF THEM HAD GONE FAR OUT TO GET A PIG OR A CHICKEN
5460-18031-0095 SOME OF THEM HAD GONE TO DEATH
5460-18031-0096 YET IN THE GOOD MAN'S SPEECH THEY WERE SCARCELY KNOWN HE DID REFER TO THEM BUT ONLY INCIDENTALLY THE HERO OF THE HOUR WAS THIS BOY DID THE NATION OWE HIM ANYTHING NO
5460-18031-0097 WHY WAS HE THE HERO SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT MAN FELL INTO THAT SAME HUMAN ERROR THAT THIS BOY WAS GREAT BECAUSE HE WAS AN OFFICER AND THESE WERE ONLY PRIVATE SOLDIERS
5460-18031-0098 OH I LEARNED THE LESSON THEN THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET SO LONG AS THE TONGUE OF THE BELL OF TIME CONTINUES TO SWING FOR ME GREATNESS CONSISTS NOT IN THE HOLDING OF SOME FUTURE OFFICE
5460-18031-0099 TO BE GREAT AT ALL ONE MUST BE GREAT HERE NOW IN PHILADELPHIA HE WHO CAN GIVE TO THIS CITY BETTER STREETS AND BETTER SIDEWALKS BETTER SCHOOLS AND MORE COLLEGES
5460-18031-0100 MORE HAPPINESS AND MORE CIVILIZATION MORE OF GOD HE WILL BE GREAT ANYWHERE
