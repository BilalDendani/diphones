8441-281327-0000 KING SOLOMON AND THE BIRDS KING SOLOMON WAS WISER THAN ALL MEN AND HIS FAME WAS IN ALL NATIONS ROUND ABOUT JERUSALEM HE WAS SO WISE THAT HE KNEW EVERY SPOKEN LANGUAGE YES
8441-281327-0001 BUT MORE THAN THIS HE COULD TALK WITH EVERYTHING THAT LIVED TREES AND FLOWERS BEASTS AND FOWLS CREEPING THINGS AND FISHES WHAT A VERY PLEASANT THING THAT WAS FOR SOLOMON TO BE SURE
8441-281327-0002 AND HOW GLAD ONE WOULD BE NOWADAYS TO HAVE SUCH KNOWLEDGE SOLOMON WAS ESPECIALLY FOND OF BIRDS AND LOVED TO TALK WITH THEM BECAUSE THEIR VOICES WERE SO SWEET AND THEY SPOKE SUCH BEAUTIFUL WORDS ONE DAY
8441-281327-0003 THE WISE KING WAS CHATTING PLEASANTLY WITH THE BIRDS WHO LIVED IN HIS WONDERFUL GARDEN AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH HE HEARD THEM SAY THE NIGHTINGALE THE SWEETEST SINGER OF ALL CHANTED
8441-281327-0004 CONTENTMENT IS THE GREATEST HAPPINESS IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MOST PEOPLE NEVER TO HAVE BEEN BORN CROONED THE MELANCHOLY TURTLE DOVE THE HAPPY LITTLE SWALLOW GAVE HER OPINION DO GOOD
8441-281327-0005 AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED HEREAFTER THE HARSH CRY OF THE PEACOCK MEANT AS THOU JUDGEST SO SHALT THOU BE JUDGED THE HOOPOE SAID HE WHO HAS NO PITY FOR OTHERS WILL FIND NONE FOR HIMSELF
8441-281327-0006 THE CYNICAL OLD CROW CROAKED DISAGREEABLY THE FURTHER AWAY FROM MEN I AM THE BETTER I AM PLEASED LAST OF ALL THE COCK WHO SINGS IN THE MORNING CHANTED HIS JOYOUS SONG THINK OF YOUR CREATOR
8441-281327-0007 O FOOLISH CREATURES WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED TALKING KING SOLOMON SOFTLY STROKED THE HEAD OF THE PRETTY LITTLE DOVE
8441-281327-0008 FOR LIFE WAS NOT SO DREADFUL A THING AFTER ALL AND HE GAVE HER PERMISSION TO BUILD HER NEST UNDER THE WALLS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE WHICH HE WAS BUILDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HOUSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD
8441-281327-0009 SOME YEARS AFTERWARD THE DOVES HAD SO INCREASED IN NUMBERS THAT WITH THEIR EXTENDED WINGS THEY FORMED A VEIL OVER THE NUMBERLESS PILGRIMS WHO CAME TO JERUSALEM TO VISIT THE WONDERFUL TEMPLE
8441-281327-0010 BUT OF ALL THE WINGED SINGERS WHO SPOKE THAT DAY IN THE GARDEN THE WISE KING CHOSE TO HAVE EVER NEAR HIM THE COCK BECAUSE HE HAD SPOKEN WORDS OF PIETY AND THE NIMBLE HOOPOE BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO PLUNGE HIS CLEAR GAZE
8441-281327-0011 INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH AS IF IT WERE MADE OF TRANSPARENT GLASS AND DISCOVER THE PLACES WHERE SPRINGS OF LIVING WATER WERE HIDDEN UNDER THE SOIL IT WAS VERY CONVENIENT FOR SOLOMON WHEN HE WAS TRAVELING TO HAVE SOME ONE WITH HIM
8441-281327-0012 WHO WAS ABLE TO FIND WATER IN WHATSOEVER PLACE HE MIGHT BE RESTING THUS THE COCK AND THE HOOPOE BECAME SOLOMON'S CLOSEST COMPANIONS BUT OF THE TWO THE HOOPOE WAS HIS FAVORITE THE HOOPOE IS AN EASTERN BIRD AND WE DO NOT SEE HIM IN AMERICA
8441-281327-0013 COLORED A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH GRAY WITH FEATHERS OF PURPLE BROWN AND WHITE AND HIS BLACK WINGS ARE BANDED WITH WHITE BUT THE PECULIAR THING ABOUT A HOOPOE IS HIS CROWN OF TAWNY FEATHERS A TALL CROWN FOR SO SMALL A BIRD
8441-281327-0014 AND THIS IS THE STORY OF THE HOOPOE'S CROWN ONE DAY WHEN SOLOMON WAS JOURNEYING ACROSS THE DESERT HE WAS SORELY DISTRESSED BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN UNTIL HE CAME NEAR TO FAINTING JUST THEN HE SPIED A FLOCK OF HIS FRIENDS
8441-281327-0015 THE HOOPOES FLYING PAST AND CALLING TO THEM FEEBLY HE BEGGED THEM TO SHELTER HIM FROM THE BURNING RAYS THE KING OF THE HOOPOES GATHERED TOGETHER HIS WHOLE NATION
8441-281327-0016 IN A THICK CLOUD OVER THE HEAD OF SOLOMON WHILE HE CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY IN GRATITUDE THE WISE KING OFFERED TO GIVE HIS FEATHERED FRIENDS WHATEVER REWARD THEY MIGHT ASK
8441-281327-0017 FOR A WHOLE DAY THE HOOPOES TALKED THE MATTER OVER AMONG THEMSELVES THEN THEIR KING CAME TO SOLOMON AND SAID TO HIM WE HAVE CONSIDERED YOUR OFFER O GENEROUS KING
8441-281327-0018 EACH OF US A GOLDEN CROWN ON HIS HEAD KING SOLOMON SMILED AND ANSWERED CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL YOU HAVE BUT YOU ARE FOOLISH BIRDS MY HOOPOES AND WHEN THE EVIL DAYS SHALL COME UPON YOU AND YOU SEE THE FOLLY OF YOUR DESIRE
8441-281327-0019 RETURN HERE TO ME AND I WILL HELP YOU YET AGAIN SO THE KING OF THE HOOPOES LEFT KING SOLOMON WITH A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN CROWN UPON HIS HEAD AND SOON ALL THE HOOPOES WERE WEARING GOLDEN CROWNS THEREUPON
8441-281327-0020 THEY GREW VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY THEY WENT DOWN BY THE LAKES AND POOLS
8441-281327-0021 AND THE QUEEN OF THE HOOPOES BECAME VERY AIRY AND REFUSED TO SPEAK TO HER OWN COUSIN AND TO THE OTHER BIRDS WHO HAD ONCE BEEN HER FRIENDS THERE WAS A CERTAIN FOWLER WHO USED TO SET TRAPS FOR BIRDS
8441-281327-0022 HE PUT A PIECE OF BROKEN MIRROR INTO HIS TRAP AND A HOOPOE SPYING IT WENT IN TO ADMIRE HERSELF AND WAS CAUGHT THE FOWLER LOOKED AT THE SHINING CROWN UPON HER HEAD AND SAID WHAT HAVE WE HERE
8441-281327-0023 I NEVER SAW A CROWN LIKE THIS UPON ANY BIRD I MUST ASK ABOUT THIS
8441-281327-0024 AND HIS EYES STUCK OUT OF HIS HEAD BUT HE SAID CARELESSLY IT IS A CROWN OF BRASS MY FRIEND I WILL GIVE YOU A QUARTER OF A SHEKEL FOR IT AND IF YOU FIND ANY MORE BRING THEM TO ME BUT
8441-281327-0025 BE SURE TO TELL NO OTHER MAN OF THE MATTER A SHEKEL WAS ABOUT SIXTY TWO CENTS AFTER THIS THE FOWLER CAUGHT MANY HOOPOES IN THE SAME WAY AND SOLD THEIR CROWNS TO ISSACHAR
8441-281327-0026 BUT ONE DAY AS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE METALWORKER'S SHOP HE MET A JEWELER AND TO HIM HE SHOWED ONE OF THE HOOPOES CROWNS WHAT IS THIS AND WHERE DID YOU FIND IT EXCLAIMED THE JEWELER IT IS PURE GOLD
8441-281327-0027 A TALENT WAS WORTH THREE HUNDRED SHEKELS
8441-281327-0028 EVERY ONE TURNED FOWLER AND BEGAN TO HUNT THE PRECIOUS BIRDS
8441-281327-0029 BIRD LIME WAS MADE IN EVERY TOWN AND THE PRICE OF TRAPS ROSE IN THE MARKET SO THAT THE TRAP MAKERS BECAME RICH MEN NOT A HOOPOE COULD SHOW HIS UNLUCKY HEAD WITHOUT BEING SLAIN OR TAKEN CAPTIVE
8441-281327-0030 IT SEEMED THAT SOON THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HOOPOES LEFT TO BEWAIL THEIR SAD FATE AT LAST THE FEW WHO STILL LIVED GATHERED TOGETHER AND HELD A MEETING TO CONSIDER WHAT SHOULD BE DONE FOR THEIR MINDS WERE FILLED WITH SORROW AND DISMAY
8441-281327-0031 AND THEY DECIDED TO APPEAL ONCE MORE TO KING SOLOMON WHO HAD GRANTED THEIR FOOLISH PRAYER FLYING BY STEALTH THROUGH THE LONELIEST WAYS THE UNHAPPY KING OF THE HOOPOES CAME AT LAST TO THE COURT OF THE KING
8441-281327-0032 AND STOOD ONCE MORE BEFORE THE STEPS OF HIS GOLDEN THRONE WITH TEARS AND GROANS HE RELATED THE SAD FORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIS GOLDEN CROWNED RACE
8441-281327-0033 KING SOLOMON LOOKED KINDLY UPON THE KING OF THE HOOPOES AND SAID BEHOLD DID I NOT WARN YOU OF YOUR FOLLY IN DESIRING TO HAVE CROWNS OF GOLD VANITY AND PRIDE HAVE BEEN YOUR RUIN
8441-281327-0034 BUT NOW THAT THERE MAY BE A MEMORIAL OF THE SERVICE WHICH ONCE YOU DID ME YOUR CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL BE CHANGED INTO CROWNS OF FEATHERS AND WITH THEM YOU MAY WALK UNHARMED UPON THE EARTH
8441-281327-0035 IN THIS WAY THE REMAINING HOOPOES WERE SAVED FOR WHEN THE FOWLERS SAW THAT THEY NO LONGER WORE CROWNS OF GOLD UPON THEIR HEADS THEY CEASED TO HUNT THEM AS THEY HAD BEEN DOING
8441-281327-0036 SOLOMON WAS EVER SEEKING TO GROW EVEN WISER THE BETTER TO KNOW THE WONDERS OF GOD'S WORLD AND THE WAYS OF ALL CREATURES HE UNDERTOOK MANY JOURNEYS NOT AS WE ORDINARY POOR MORTALS TRAVEL
8441-281327-0037 IN HEAVY WAGONS OR CLUMSY BOATS BY DUSTY ROADS OR STORMY WAVES IT WAS IN NO SUCH TROUBLOUS WAYS THAT SOLOMON THE ALL POWERFUL TRAVERSED SPACE AND REACHED THE UTTERMOST CORNERS OF THE EARTH THANKS TO HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE
8441-281327-0038 HE HAD DISCOVERED A MEANS OF LOCOMOTION COMPARED TO WHICH THE MOST MAGNIFICENT RAILWAY COACHES AND THE RICHEST PALANQUINS OF INDIAN PRINCES WOULD SEEM POOR INDEED HE HAD CAUSED HIS GENII TO MAKE A SILKEN CARPET OF FOUR LEAGUES IN EXTENT
8441-281327-0039 OF SILVER OF WOOD FOR THE MULTITUDE OF PERSONS OF DIFFERENT RANK WHOM HE TOOK WITH HIM THERE WAS ALSO NO LACK OF THE MOST GORGEOUS FURNITURE
8441-281327-0040 WHEN ALL WAS READY SOLOMON WAS WONT TO SEAT HIMSELF UPON HIS THRONE AND WOULD COMMAND THE WINDS TO DO THEIR DUTY
8441-281327-0041 DURING THE JOURNEY ABOVE THE AERIAL CARAVAN FLUTTERED A CLOUD OF BIRDS
8441-281327-0042 FROM THE SUN'S HEAT AS THE HOOPOES HAD FIRST DONE ONE DAY WHILE ON SUCH A JOURNEY
8441-281327-0043 WHICH OVERHUNG HIS HEAD SHADING HIS EYES THE KING GLANCED UP AND PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS AN OPENING IN THE CANOPY ONE BIRD WAS MISSING FROM ITS POST IN GREAT DISPLEASURE SOLOMON DEMANDED OF THE EAGLE THE NAME OF THE TRUANT
8441-281327-0044 ANXIOUSLY THE EAGLE CALLED THE ROLL OF ALL THE BIRDS IN HIS COMPANY AND HE WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND THAT IT WAS SOLOMON'S FAVORITE THE HOOPOE WHO WAS MISSING WITH TERROR HE ANNOUNCED THE BIRD'S DESERTION TO THE MOST WISE KING
8441-281327-0045 SOAR ALOFT COMMANDED SOLOMON STERNLY AND FIND THE HOOPOE THAT I MAY PUNISH HIM I WILL PLUCK OFF HIS FEATHERS THAT HE MAY FEEL THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE SUN AS HIS CARELESSNESS HAS CAUSED ME TO DO THE EAGLE SOARED HEAVENWARD
8441-281327-0046 UNTIL THE EARTH BENEATH HIM LOOKED LIKE A BOWL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
8441-281327-0047 THE EAGLE SWOOPED DOWN AND WOULD HAVE SEIZED THE CULPRIT ROUGHLY IN HIS STRONG TALONS BUT THE HOOPOE BEGGED HIM FOR SOLOMON'S SAKE TO BE GENTLE FOR SOLOMON'S SAKE CRIED THE EAGLE DO YOU DARE TO NAME THE KING WHOM YOU HAVE INJURED
8441-281327-0048 HE HAS DISCOVERED YOUR ABSENCE AND IN HIS RIGHTEOUS ANGER WILL PUNISH YOU SEVERELY LEAD ME TO HIM REPLIED THE HOOPOE I KNOW THAT HE WILL FORGIVE ME WHEN HE HEARS WHERE I HAVE BEEN AND WHAT I HAVE TO TELL HIM
8441-281327-0049 THE EAGLE LED HIM TO THE KING WHO WITH A WRATHFUL FACE WAS SITTING ON HIS THRONE THE HOOPOE TREMBLED AND DROOPED HIS FEATHERS HUMBLY BUT WHEN SOLOMON WOULD HAVE CRUSHED HIM IN HIS MIGHTY FIST THE BIRD CRIED
8441-281327-0050 REMEMBER KING THAT ONE DAY YOU ALSO MUST GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOUR SINS LET ME NOT THEREFORE BE CONDEMNED UNHEARD AND IF I HEAR YOU WHAT EXCUSE CAN YOU HAVE TO OFFER ANSWERED SOLOMON FROWNING
8441-281327-0051 BUT THIS WAS HIS FAVORITE BIRD AND HE HOPED THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME REASON FOR SPARING HIM WELL SAID THE HOOPOE AT MECCA I MET A HOOPOE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO TOLD ME SO WONDERFUL A TALE OF THE MARVELOUS KINGDOM OF SHEBA
8441-281327-0052 IN ARABIA THAT I COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO VISIT THAT COUNTRY OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES AND THERE INDEED I SAW THE MOST PRODIGIOUS TREASURES BUT BEST OF ALL O KING
8441-281327-0053 MORE GLORIOUS THAN GOLD MORE PRECIOUS THAN RARE JEWELS I SAW QUEEN BALKIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF QUEENS TELL ME OF THIS QUEEN SAID SOLOMON LOOSENING HIS ROUGH GRASP UPON THE HOOPOE
8441-281327-0054 SO IT WAS SAY THE MUSSULMANS THAT A BIRD TOLD SOLOMON OF THE GREAT QUEEN WHOSE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM IS DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE
8441-281327-0055 AND HER BEAUTY UNTIL SOLOMON SIGHED A GREAT SIGH AND SAID IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE BUT WE SHALL SEE SO THE KING WROTE A LETTER TO BALKIS
8441-281327-0056 BIDDING HER FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF FATE AND COME TO THE COURT OF THE WISE KING THIS NOTE HE SEALED WITH MUSK STAMPED WITH HIS GREAT SIGNET AND GAVE TO THE HOOPOE SAYING IF NOW YOU HAVE SPOKEN TRUTH
8441-281327-0057 TAKE THIS LETTER TO QUEEN BALKIS THEN COME AWAY THE HOOPOE DID AS HE WAS BID DARTING OFF TOWARDS THE SOUTH LIKE AN ARROW AND THE NEXT DAY HE CAME TO THE PALACE OF THE QUEEN OF SHEBA WHERE SHE SAT
8441-281327-0058 IN ALL HER SPLENDOR AMONG HER COUNSELORS HE HOPPED INTO THE HALL AND DROPPED THE LETTER INTO HER LAP THEN FLEW AWAY QUEEN BALKIS STARED AND STARED AT THE GREAT KING'S SEAL UPON THE MYSTERIOUS LETTER
8441-281327-0059 AND WHEN SHE HAD READ THE BRIEF INVITATION SHE STARED AND STARED AGAIN BUT SHE HAD HEARD THE FAME OF SOLOMON AND WAS EAGER TO ASK HIM
8441-281327-0060 SOME OF HER CLEVER QUESTIONS TO PROVE HIS WISDOM SO SHE DECIDED TO ACCEPT HIS INVITATION AND COME TO JERUSALEM SHE CAME WITH A GREAT TRAIN OF ATTENDANTS WITH CAMELS THAT BORE SPICES AND TREASURES OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES
