8459-292347-0000 OR THE TRIBES OF THE GODDESS DANU BUT THE POOR CALLED THEM AND STILL SOMETIMES CALL THEM
8459-292347-0001 THE PEOPLE OF THE FAERY HILLS AS THESE WORDS ARE USUALLY EXPLAINED
8459-292347-0002 THEY JOURNEY IN WHIRLING WINDS THE WINDS THAT WERE CALLED THE DANCE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF HERODIAS IN THE MIDDLE AGES HERODIAS DOUBTLESS TAKING THE PLACE OF SOME OLD GODDESS WHEN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE SEE THE LEAVES WHIRLING ON THE ROAD THEY BLESS THEMSELVES
8459-292347-0003 THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS SAID TO WEAR NO COVERING UPON THEIR HEADS
8459-292347-0004 AND THE GREAT AMONG THEM FOR THEY HAVE GREAT AND SIMPLE GO MUCH UPON HORSEBACK IF ANY ONE BECOMES TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN THEM AND SEES THEM OVER MUCH HE LOSES ALL INTEREST IN ORDINARY THINGS
8459-292347-0005 I SHALL WRITE A GREAT DEAL ELSEWHERE ABOUT SUCH ENCHANTED PERSONS AND CAN GIVE BUT AN EXAMPLE OR TWO NOW A WOMAN NEAR GORT IN GALWAY SAYS THERE IS A BOY NOW OF THE CLORAN'S BUT I WOULDN'T FOR THE WORLD LET THEM THINK I SPOKE OF HIM
8459-292347-0006 IT'S TWO YEARS SINCE HE CAME FROM AMERICA AND SINCE THAT TIME HE NEVER WENT TO MASS OR TO CHURCH OR TO FAIRS OR TO MARKET OR TO STAND ON THE CROSS ROADS OR TO HURLING OR TO NOTHING AND IF ANY ONE COMES INTO THE HOUSE
8459-292347-0007 NOT TO SEE THEM AND AS TO WORK HE HAS THE GARDEN DUG TO BITS AND THE WHOLE PLACE SMEARED WITH COW DUNG AND SUCH A CROP AS WAS NEVER SEEN AND THE ALDERS ALL PLAITED TILL THEY LOOK GRAND ONE DAY HE WENT AS FAR AS THE CHAPEL
8459-292347-0008 BUT AS SOON AS HE GOT TO THE DOOR HE TURNED STRAIGHT ROUND AGAIN AS IF HE HADN'T POWER TO PASS IT
8459-292347-0009 ONE HEARS MANY STORIES OF THE KIND AND A MAN WHOSE SON IS BELIEVED TO GO OUT RIDING AMONG THEM AT NIGHT TELLS ME THAT HE IS CARELESS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND LIES IN BED UNTIL IT IS LATE IN THE DAY A DOCTOR BELIEVES THIS BOY TO BE MAD
8459-292347-0010 THOSE THAT ARE AT TIMES AWAY AS IT IS CALLED KNOW ALL THINGS BUT ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK A COUNTRYMAN AT KILTARTAN SAYS THERE WAS ONE OF THE LYDONS JOHN WAS AWAY FOR SEVEN YEARS LYING IN HIS BED
8459-292347-0011 BUT THEY WERE VEXED AT THAT AND TOOK AWAY THE POWER SO THAT HE NEVER KNEW ANYTHING AGAIN NO MORE THAN ANOTHER THIS WISDOM IS THE WISDOM OF THE FOOLS OF THE CELTIC STORIES THAT WAS ABOVE ALL THE WISDOM OF THE WISE
8459-292347-0012 LOMNA THE FOOL OF FIANN HAD SO GREAT WISDOM THAT HIS HEAD CUT FROM HIS BODY WAS STILL ABLE TO SING AND PROPHESY AND A WRITER IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA WRITES THAT TRISTRAM IN THE OLDEST FORM OF THE TALE OF TRISTRAM AND ISEULT DRANK WISDOM
8459-292347-0013 AND MADNESS THE SHADOW OF WISDOM AND NOT LOVE OUT OF THE MAGIC CUP THE GREAT OF THE OLD TIMES ARE AMONG THE TRIBES OF DANU AND ARE KINGS AND QUEENS AMONG THEM
8459-292347-0014 AND YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH HE APPEARED TO A KING IN A FOREST AND WAS A FLAMING MAN THAT HE MIGHT LEAD HIM IN THE DARKNESS WHEN THE KING ASKED HIM WHO HE WAS HE SAID I AM YOUR CANDLESTICK I DO NOT REMEMBER WHERE I HAVE READ THIS STORY
8459-292347-0015 AND I HAVE MAYBE HALF FORGOTTEN IT
8459-292347-0016 I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT HER IN THE WANDERING OF USHEEN AND HE CAME BACK AT LAST TO BITTERNESS AND WEARINESS KNOCKNAREA IS IN SLIGO
8459-292347-0017 IS BURIED IN THE CAIRN OF STONES UPON IT I HAVE WRITTEN OF CLOOTH NA BARE IN THE CELTIC TWILIGHT SHE WENT ALL OVER THE WORLD SEEKING A LAKE DEEP ENOUGH TO DROWN HER FAERY LIFE OF WHICH SHE HAD GROWN WEARY LEAPING FROM HILL TO HILL AND SETTING UP A CAIRN OF STONES WHEREVER HER FEET LIGHTED
8459-292347-0018 ON THE TOP OF THE BIRD MOUNTAIN IN SLIGO I FORGET NOW WHERE I HEARD THIS STORY BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN FROM A PRIEST AT COLLOONEY
8459-292347-0019 HE DESCRIBES LOUGH LIATH AS A DESOLATE MOON SHAPED LAKE WITH MADE WELLS AND SUNKEN PASSAGES UPON ITS BORDERS AND BESET BY MARSH AND HEATHER AND GRAY BOULDERS AND CLOSES HIS FLIGHT OF THE EAGLE WITH A LONG RHAPSODY UPON MOUNTAIN AND LAKE
8459-292347-0020 BECAUSE OF THE HEROIC TALES AND BEAUTIFUL OLD MYTHS THAT HAVE HUNG ABOUT THEM ALWAYS
8459-292347-0021 AND SO CHANGED HIM WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS THAT THOUGH SHE HAD TO FREE HIM BECAUSE OF THE THREATS OF THE FIANA HIS HAIR WAS EVER AFTERWARDS AS WHITE AS SNOW TO THIS DAY THE TRIBES OF THE GODDESS DANU THAT ARE IN THE WATERS BECKON TO MEN AND DROWN THEM IN THE WATERS
8459-292347-0022 THE WHITE HAIR OF FIONN MAY BE BUT ANOTHER OF THE TROUBLES OF THOSE THAT COME TO UNEARTHLY WISDOM AND EARTHLY TROUBLE AND THE THREATS AND VIOLENCE OF THE FIANA AGAINST HER A DIFFERENT FORM OF THE THREATS AND VIOLENCE THE COUNTRY PEOPLE USE TO MAKE THE TRIBES OF DANU GIVE UP THOSE THAT ARE AWAY
