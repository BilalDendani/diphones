2606-132102-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE TWO YEARS AFTERWARD IT WAS A PLEASANT MORNING IN EARLY JUNE A WARM WIND WAS RUSTLING THE TREES WHICH WERE COVERED THICKLY WITH HALF OPENED LEAVES AND LOOKED LIKE FOUNTAINS OF GREEN SPRAY THROWN HIGH INTO THE AIR
2606-132102-0001 DOCTOR CARR'S FRONT DOOR STOOD WIDE OPEN THROUGH THE PARLOR WINDOW CAME THE SOUND OF PIANO PRACTICE AND ON THE STEPS UNDER THE BUDDING ROSES SAT A SMALL FIGURE BUSILY SEWING THIS WAS CLOVER LITTLE CLOVER STILL THOUGH MORE THAN TWO YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE WE SAW HER LAST
2606-132102-0002 AND SHE WAS NOW OVER FOURTEEN CLOVER WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE TALL HER EYES WERE AS BLUE AND SWEET AS EVER
2606-132102-0003 BUT THE BROWN PIG TAILS WERE PINNED UP INTO A ROUND KNOT AND THE CHILDISH FACE HAD GAINED ALMOST A WOMANLY LOOK OLD MARY DECLARED THAT MISS CLOVER WAS GETTING QUITE YOUNG LADYFIED AND MISS CLOVER WAS QUITE AWARE OF THE FACT AND MIGHTILY PLEASED WITH IT
2606-132102-0004 IT DELIGHTED HER TO TURN UP HER HAIR AND SHE WAS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HAVING HER DRESSES MADE TO COME BELOW THE TOPS OF HER BOOTS SHE HAD ALSO LEFT OFF RUFFLES AND WORE NARROW COLLARS INSTEAD AND LITTLE CUFFS WITH SLEEVE BUTTONS TO FASTEN THEM
2606-132102-0005 THESE SLEEVE BUTTONS WHICH WERE A PRESENT FROM COUSIN HELEN CLOVER LIKED BEST OF ALL HER THINGS PAPA SAID THAT HE WAS SURE SHE TOOK THEM TO BED WITH HER BUT OF COURSE THAT WAS ONLY A JOKE THOUGH SHE CERTAINLY WAS NEVER SEEN WITHOUT THEM IN THE DAYTIME
2606-132102-0006 HE HAD GROWN INTO A BIG BOY ALL HIS PRETTY BABY CURLS WERE CUT OFF AND HIS FROCKS HAD GIVEN PLACE TO JACKET AND TROUSERS IN HIS HAND HE HELD SOMETHING WHAT CLOVER COULD NOT SEE WHAT'S THAT SHE SAID AS HE REACHED THE STEPS
2606-132102-0007 WHY OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT RIPE SAID CLOVER PUTTING ONE INTO HER MOUTH CAN'T YOU TELL BY THE TASTE THEY'RE AS GREEN AS CAN BE I DON'T CARE IF KATY SAYS THEY'RE RIPE I SHALL EAT EM
2606-132102-0008 ANSWERED PHIL DEFIANTLY MARCHING INTO THE HOUSE WHAT DID PHILLY WANT ASKED ELSIE OPENING THE PARLOR DOOR AS PHIL WENT UP STAIRS
2606-132102-0009 HOW PARTICULAR HE ALWAYS IS ABOUT ASKING NOW SAID ELSIE HE'S AFRAID OF ANOTHER DOSE OF SALTS I SHOULD THINK HE WOULD BE REPLIED CLOVER LAUGHING
2606-132102-0010 YES WENT ON ELSIE AND YOU KNOW DORRY HELD HIS IN HIS MOUTH FOR EVER SO LONG AND THEN WENT ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND SPAT IT OUT PAPA SAID HE HAD A GOOD MIND TO MAKE HIM TAKE ANOTHER SPOONFUL
2606-132102-0011 BUT HE REMEMBERED THAT AFTER ALL DORRY HAD THE BAD TASTE A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN THE OTHERS SO HE DIDN'T I THINK IT WAS AN AWFUL PUNISHMENT DON'T YOU YES BUT IT WAS A GOOD ONE
2606-132102-0012 FOR NONE OF THEM HAVE EVER TOUCHED THE GREEN GOOSEBERRIES SINCE HAVE YOU GOT THROUGH PRACTISING IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN HOUR YET OH IT ISN'T IT'S ONLY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES BUT KATY TOLD ME NOT TO SIT MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR AT A TIME WITHOUT GETTING UP AND RUNNING ROUND TO REST
2606-132102-0013 I'M GOING TO WALK TWICE DOWN TO THE GATE AND TWICE BACK I PROMISED HER I WOULD AND ELSIE SET OFF CLAPPING HER HANDS BRISKLY BEFORE AND BEHIND HER AS SHE WALKED WHY WHAT IS BRIDGET DOING IN PAPA'S ROOM SHE ASKED AS SHE CAME BACK THE SECOND TIME
2606-132102-0014 ARE THE GIRLS UP THERE I THOUGHT THEY WERE CLEANING THE DINING ROOM THEY'RE DOING BOTH KATY SAID IT WAS SUCH A GOOD CHANCE HAVING PAPA AWAY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BOTH THE CARPETS TAKEN UP AT ONCE
2606-132102-0015 THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY DINNER TODAY ONLY JUST BREAD AND BUTTER AND MILK AND COLD HAM UP IN KATY'S ROOM BECAUSE DEBBY IS HELPING TOO SO AS TO GET THROUGH AND SAVE PAPA ALL THE FUSS AND SEE EXHIBITING HER SEWING KATY'S MAKING A NEW COVER FOR PAPA'S PINCUSHION

2606-132102-0018 I'LL SEE WHAT SHE WANTS BUT CLOVER WAS ALREADY HALF WAY ACROSS THE HALL AND THE TWO GIRLS RAN UP SIDE BY SIDE THERE WAS OFTEN A LITTLE STRIFE BETWEEN THEM AS TO WHICH SHOULD ANSWER KATY'S BELL BOTH LIKED TO WAIT ON HER SO MUCH KATY CAME TO MEET THEM AS THEY ENTERED
2606-132102-0019 NOT ON HER FEET THAT ALAS WAS STILL ONLY A FAR OFF POSSIBILITY BUT IN A CHAIR WITH LARGE WHEELS WITH WHICH SHE WAS ROLLING HERSELF ACROSS THE ROOM THIS CHAIR WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HER SITTING IN IT SHE COULD GET TO HER CLOSET AND HER BUREAU DRAWERS
2606-132102-0020 AND HELP HERSELF TO WHAT SHE WANTED WITHOUT TROUBLING ANYBODY IT WAS ONLY LATELY THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO USE IT DOCTOR CARR CONSIDERED HER DOING SO AS A HOPEFUL SIGN BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD KATY THIS SHE HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO HER INVALID LIFE AT LAST
2606-132102-0021 WHICH MIGHT AFTER ALL END IN FRESH DISAPPOINTMENT SHE MET THE GIRLS WITH A BRIGHT SMILE AS THEY CAME IN AND SAID OH CLOVY IT WAS YOU I RANG FOR
