7959-109176-0000 THE WHIRLIGIGS ARE AFTER IT BUT IT EASILY AVOIDS THEM THEN COMES A SUDDEN SURPRISE A FISH POPS UP ITS MOUTH AND CLOSES ITS SCISSOR JAWS WITH A SNAP ON THE INSECT'S LEGS
7959-109176-0001 AND IT DISAPPEARS IN THE CENTRE OF A ROCKING SERIES OF RINGS THE LAKE IS PERFECTLY CALM ITS GREEN BLACK SURFACE SMOOTH AND SHINING
7959-109176-0002 AND FULL OF DRIFTING SUMMER CLOUDS THE REEDS ARE REFLECTED IN IT AND LOOK DOUBLE THEIR HEIGHT AND THE TREES MIRROR THEIR BRANCHES THERE SEEMING TWICE AS LEAFY
7959-109176-0003 AND A RED HOUSE WITH A WHITE FLAGSTAFF ON ONE OF THE BANKS BECOMES QUITE A LITTLE SUBMARINE PALACE MORE CRANE FLIES ARRIVE
7959-109176-0004 AND CIRCLE AFTER CIRCLE BREAKS THE STILLNESS OF THE WATER JUST AS MOLE HILLS BREAK THE UNIFORM SMOOTHNESS OF THE MEADOW AS FISHES MOUTHS DART UP BY THE SCORE SIDE BY SIDE
7959-109176-0005 IT IS IN ONE OF THE VALLEYS IN THE SUBMARINE MOUNTAINOUS REGION THAT THIS SHOAL OF THOUSANDS OF BLEAK LIES IT COVERS THE AREA OF A MARKET PLACE AND MAKES THE WATER ALIVE FOR FATHOMS DOWN
7959-109176-0006 ON THE OTHER THE THICK GREEN WATER GRASS WAVES AND BENDS LIKE THE CORN ON SOME FERTILE PLAIN IN HUNGARY IN FRONT AND BEHIND
7959-109176-0007 THE WATER SEETHES AND FOAMS IT IS CLEFT INCESSANTLY FROM BOTTOM TO SURFACE BUBBLES RISE AND WHIRLPOOLS ARE FORMED AND A LONG STRIP OF LAKE FOAMS AND SPURTS
7959-109176-0008 IT IS NOT LIKE A SINGLE LARGE ANIMAL DARTING FORWARD WITH RAPIDLY TWISTING TAIL AND LEAVING A WAKE AND WAVES BEHIND IT BUT A GENERAL EFFERVESCENCE THAT MAKES THE DEPTHS GLEAM WITH MILLIONS OF SCALES
7959-109176-0009 THE MARAUDERS OF THE LAKE ON A HUNTING EXPEDITION THEY GO TOGETHER IN A LARGE COMPANY LIKE SOLDIERS IN AN ARMY ROWS OF THEM ABOVE BESIDE AND BEHIND ONE ANOTHER

7959-109176-0011 CHANGING FROM THE LONG NARROW MARCHING COLUMN INTO COMPACT FORMATION A FRESH SIGNAL INAUDIBLE IMPERCEPTIBLE TO ALL BUT THEMSELVES AND ONCE MORE IN A TRICE
7959-109176-0012 THE NARROW SMOOTHLY GLIDING HUNTING COLUMN IS REFORMED JUST AS THEY TWIST AND TURN IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE SO DO THEY IN THE VERTICAL
7959-109176-0013 WHILE THEY PASS THROUGH ONE OF THE NARROWS IN THE SUBMARINE MOUNTAINOUS REGION IT IS THE SHOAL OF BLEAK THEY ARE AFTER NOW THEY ARE IN THE VALLEY WHERE IT LIES
7959-109176-0014 THE LIVELY LITTLE FRESHWATER HERRING AS YET SUSPECT NO DANGER THEY ARE IN CONSTANT MOTION OCCUPIED IN SNAPPING UP THE FALLEN HALF DROWNED INSECTS
7959-109176-0015 FOR WHEN THE UPPER LAYER IS SATIATED IT LIKES TO ENJOY ITS FEELING OF WELL BEING IN PEACE UNTIL VORACITY ONCE MORE MAKES THEM ALL RIVALS THE SPLASH OF THE WAVES ON THE SURFACE LIFTS THE GLUTTONS UP AND DOWN
7959-109176-0016 WHILE THE GROUND SWELL ROCKS THE SATIATED TO REST THE PERCH HAVE QUICKENED THEIR PACE INVOLUNTARILY THE SPEED IS INCREASED THEY ALREADY SCENT THEIR PREY
7959-109176-0017 FOREMOST OF THE COMPANY WITH A DARK GOLDEN HIGH BACKED LEADER AT THEIR HEAD SWIM A COUPLE OF HUNDRED OF THE FINEST PERCH THEY ARE AT THEIR STRONGEST AGE AND IN BEST POSSIBLE CONDITION
7959-109176-0018 AFTER THEM COMES THE GREAT MASS OF THE HORDE BIG HEAVILY LADEN CRAFT THEIR ROUND BACKS AND SWELLING BELLIES TESTIFYING TO THEIR SUCCESS IN THEIR TOIL FOR MATERIAL NEEDS
7959-109176-0019 THERE ARE PERCH AMONG THEM OF HALF AN ARM'S LENGTH AND THE THICKNESS OF THE BIGGEST OF WRISTS SHEAVES OF SILVERY GLEAMING RAYS FLICKER FAR OUT IN THEIR WAKE THE REST OF THE FIERCE HORDE ARE LARGE AND SMALL MINGLED
7959-109176-0020 AND RANK UPON RANK OF OTHERS WELL OVER TWO POUNDS FOR THE PRESENT THE WHOLE FLOCK KEEPS TO THE BOTTOM DARTING ALONG WITH DORSAL FIN ERECT THE STIFF SPINES BRISTLING MENACINGLY
7959-109176-0021 IT IS AS WELL TO HAVE BAYONETS FIXED IN CASE OF THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF A PIKE ALL AT ONCE THE VAN SLIPS AWAY FROM THE REST AND THE LATTER HAVE TO EXERT THEMSELVES TO CATCH UP
7959-109176-0022 TWISTING AND TURNING THEIR TAILS AND UNFURLING THE STIFF SAIL OF THEIR DORSAL FIN THERE MUST BE NOTHING NOW TO CHECK THEIR SPEED FAIR WEATHER SAILING IS OVER AND THE PRIVATEERING EXPEDITION HAS BEGUN
7959-109176-0023 THE CERTAINTY OF BOOTY FILLS THEM ALL THE VANGUARD HAS LED THE MARAUDERS WELL THEY HAVE COME UNDER THEIR PREY AND NOW SHOOT UP AMONG THE UNFORTUNATE UNSUSPECTING BLEAK
7959-109176-0024 ALL ORDER AMONG THE ASSAILANTS INSTANTLY CEASES AND EACH MEMBER THINKS ONLY OF ITS OWN MOUTH AND CARES FOR NOTHING BUT GETTING IT FILLED LIKE YELLOW FLASHES OF WATER LIGHTNING THE PERCH DART INTO THE SHOAL OF LITTLE FISH
7959-109176-0025 AND LIKE GRAIN AMONG A FLOCK OF CHICKENS MASSES OF BLEAK DISAPPEAR INTO THEIR MOUTHS THEY KILL AND DEVOUR AND IT WILL BE STILL WORSE WHEN THE REAR GUARD COMES UP NOW THEY ARRIVE
7959-109176-0026 AND THE ALARM IN THE SWARM OF BLEAK BELOW SPREADS WITH MAGICAL SWIFTNESS TO THE UPPER LAYERS WHERE THE BEWILDERED LITTLE CREATURES MAKE OFF AT FULL SPEED GLEAM AFTER GLEAM FLASHES UP AS THE LITTLE SHINING FISH UNCERTAIN OF THEIR WAY
7959-109176-0027 TWIST AND TURN ABOUT EACH MAKES ITSELF AS LONG AND THIN AS IT CAN SO AS TO SHOW AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND DISAPPEAR AS IT WERE IN THE WATER BUT NOW THE FIERCE HORDE BECOMES STILL FIERCER
7959-109176-0028 THE REAR GUARD OVERTAKES THE FUGITIVES AND CUTS OFF THEIR RETREAT AND SMACK AFTER SMACK IS HEARD AFTER THEIR CHARGE THE SWARM OF BLEAK SCATTERS IN WILD PANIC
7959-109176-0029 THOUSANDS OF THEM IN THEIR TERROR MAKE FOR THE SURFACE LEAPING INTO THE AIR LIKE JETS FROM A FOUNTAIN THEY TUMBLE OVER ONE ANOTHER AND TRY IN THEIR BEWILDERMENT WHICH CAN LEAP HIGHEST AND FARTHEST
7959-109176-0030 THEY RISE LIKE FLYING FISH OUT OF THE WATER WITH A FLASH AND ONCE MORE DISAPPEAR WITH A SPLASH INTO THE WATER THERE IS A SPLASH WHEN THEY RISE AND A SPLASH WHEN THEY AGAIN REACH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
7959-109176-0031 MAKING A SOUND LIKE THE FALLING OF TORRENTS OF RAIN HELL IS BENEATH THEM IN THE WATER THE YELLOW DEVILS NOT ONLY MENACE THEM FROM THE SIDE THEY COME UPON THEM FROM ALL DIRECTIONS
7959-109176-0032 WHEN THEY DESCEND IN CROWDS FROM THEIR FLIGHT INTO THE AIR THEY GROW STIFF WITH TERROR ON FINDING THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE WITH GREAT AMBER EYES THAT SEEM STARTING OUT OF THEIR SOCKETS TO GO GREEDILY HUNTING ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT
7959-109176-0033 THEN A MOUTH OPENS SHOOTS OUT A PAIR OF CONCERTINA LIKE LIPS AND CHANGES INTO A FUNNEL AND THE POOR LITTLE FISH DISAPPEAR INTO A CHASM LIKE THREADS INTO A VACUUM CLEANER
7959-109176-0034 ABOVE THE SPOT A CLOUD OF TERNS IS CIRCLING THEY FLY LOW WITH HALF EXTENDED LEGS AND DROOPING WINGS READY TO DART DOWN SOMETIMES THEY MAKE A CATCH
7959-109176-0035 THE BIRDS HOLD THEM AT ALL SORTS OF ANGLES IN THEIR BEAK AND FLY AWAY WITH THEM SHRIEKING AND SCREAMING PURSUED BY THEIR FELLOWS POOR LITTLE BLEAK THEY WERE SO PRETTY TO LOOK AT
7959-109176-0036 AND THE RIMS OF THEIR EYES WHEN THEY BLINKED COULD SPARKLE AND SHINE LIKE THE GEM ITSELF THEIR SHINING BREAST WAS WHITER THAN A SWAN'S AND THEIR PLUMP SIDES GLEAMED AND SPARKLED LIKE ICE UNDER A WINTRY MOON
7959-109176-0037 BUT FROM THE TIME THEY LEFT THEIR CREATOR'S HAND THEY WERE INTENDED TO SERVE AS FOOD FOR OTHERS A BOAT LAY ANCHORED A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF IN IT WAS AN ELDERLY MAN
7959-109176-0038 AN ANGLER THIS HE HAD BEEN OUT SINCE EARLY MORNING AND HAD A DELIGHTFUL DAY NOT A SINGLE BITE BUT WHAT DID THAT MATTER HE WAS LYING NOW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT DREAMING
7959-109176-0039 HE WAS A REGULAR VISITOR TO THE LAKE HIS ANCESTORS LOVE OF A FREE OUT OF DOOR LIFE HAD ENTERED INTO HIS BLOOD IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IT TAKES THREE GENERATIONS TO MAKE A GENTLEMAN
7959-109176-0040 BUT IT WOULD TAKE THREE TIMES AS MANY TO CREATE OUT OF A RACE THAT EVER SINCE THE MORNING OF TIME HAD LIVED OUT OF DOORS A GENERATION THAT DID NOT CARE TO HANDLE EITHER GUN OR ROD
7959-109176-0041 IN HIS YOUTH HIS GUN HAD BEEN HIS BEST FRIEND BUT THE CHASE DEMANDS MUCH OF LEGS AND MUSCLES AND HEART WHEN A MAN IS NO LONGER IN HIS PRIME HE SHOULD BEWARE OF PAYING ARDENT COURT TO DAME DIANA IN HER SUITE
7959-109176-0042 IT IS USELESS TO DENY IT THE OLD MAN IS SELDOM LOOKED UPON WITH FAVOUR HE HAS HAD HIS DAY BUT FATHER NEPTUNE CLASPS HIM RAPTUROUSLY IN HIS WET EMBRACE AND SETS THE FISH AROUND HIS BOAT
7959-109176-0043 AND THEN DROVE OUT TO THE LAKE HE FISHED IN THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED WAY TALKED VERY LITTLE
7959-109176-0044 THE WEATHER TO DAY FROM A FISHERMAN'S POINT OF VIEW IS THE WORST POSSIBLE THE JULY SUN IS SHINING HOTLY AND SENDS ITS BEAMS DEEP DOWN INTO THE WATER THE LAKE SLUMBERS
7959-109176-0045 THERE IS A BOTTLE GREEN HUE ABOVE THE DEEP WATER AND A LILAC SHADE IN THE SHALLOWS
7959-109176-0046 FAR OFF A FLOCK OF WILD DUCKS RISING RAISE SOME LITTLE GENTLE WAVES THAT LOOK SO BLUE SO BLUE
7959-109176-0047 THE ANGLER WHO IS A BIG STURDY MAN WITH LARGE BLACK RIMMED SPECTACLES UPON HIS VOLUMINOUS NOSE IS IN HIS CUSTOMARY FISHING DRESS AN OLD STRAW HAT WITH AN ELASTIC UNDER THE CHIN
7959-109176-0048 HIS COAT OFF AND NO COLLAR ON HIS LEGS A PAIR OF THICK YELLOWISH BROWN MOLESKIN TROUSERS HIS FEET IN A PAIR OF FELT SHOES LINED WITH STRAW HE GENERALLY STAYS ALL DAY
7959-109176-0049 AND IT IS STILL FAR FROM EVENING HE IS NOW LYING OUTSTRETCHED IN MIDDAY DROWSINESS ENJOYING THE GREAT PEACE THAT RESTS ON THE LAKE
7959-109176-0050 HE HAS WOUND THE ENDS OF HIS LINES ROUND HIS WRIST HE WAITS PATIENTLY AND IF TOWARDS EVENING HE IS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAUL IN A PIKE HE WILL BE FILLED WITH A QUIET INTENSE JOY
7959-109176-0051 SUDDENLY HE AWAKES WITH A START HE HEARS A RUSHING SOUND LIKE THAT OF THE PADDLES OF A DISTANT STEAMER STRIKING AND TEARING THE WATER
7959-109176-0052 HE SEES THE TERNS FLOCKING AND THE SURFACE OF THE WATER BROKEN AGAIN AND AGAIN BY BLEAK LEAPING HIGH INTO THE AIR HE TAKES UP HIS ANCHOR AND ROWS UP UNTIL HE HEARS THE SMACK SMACK OF THE GREEDY PERCH ALL ROUND HIM
7959-109176-0053 AND KNOWS HE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WHIRLPOOL OF FISH HE GETS FOUR LINES CLEAR AND HAS ENOUGH TO DO IN THROWING THEM OUT AND PULLING THEM IN HE THROWS OFF HIS HAT AND WAISTCOAT AND LOOSENS HIS BELT
7959-109176-0054 BUT EVEN THEN HE IS DRENCHED WITH PERSPIRATION AT LAST HE CAN DO NO MORE AND DROPS EXHAUSTED ON TO A THWART IN LESS THAN TWENTY MINUTES HE HAS CAUGHT MORE THAN FIFTY PERCH
7959-109176-0055 WEIGHING FROM ONE TO THREE POUNDS APIECE THEY ARE LYING IN A BRASSY HEAP IN THE BOAT THEN HE OPENS HIS WALLET TAKES OUT THE BOTTLE CONTAINING CLEAR LIQUID AND TAKES A NIP
7959-109176-0056 THIS HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO DO EVERY TIME HE CATCHES A FISH OF ANY IMPORTANCE HE DRINKS TO THE HEALTH OF THE LAKE THE LAKE WITH THE FRESH WAVES AND THE CLEAR BRIGHT WATER
