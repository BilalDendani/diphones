100-122655-0000 IN A FEW DAYS I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED MY HEALTH THAT I COULD SIT UP ALL DAY AND WALK OUT SOMETIMES I COULD JOIN WITH DIANA AND MARY IN ALL THEIR OCCUPATIONS CONVERSE WITH THEM AS MUCH AS THEY WISHED
100-122655-0001 AND AID THEM WHEN AND WHERE THEY WOULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A REVIVING PLEASURE IN THIS INTERCOURSE OF A KIND NOW TASTED BY ME FOR THE FIRST TIME
100-122655-0002 I LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY ENJOYED DELIGHTED ME WHAT THEY APPROVED I REVERENCED THEY LOVED THEIR SEQUESTERED HOME I TOO IN THE GREY SMALL ANTIQUE STRUCTURE
100-122655-0003 ITS AVENUE OF AGED FIRS ALL GROWN ASLANT UNDER THE STRESS OF MOUNTAIN WINDS ITS GARDEN DARK WITH YEW AND HOLLY AND WHERE NO FLOWERS BUT OF THE HARDIEST SPECIES WOULD BLOOM FOUND A CHARM BOTH POTENT AND PERMANENT
100-122655-0004 THEY CLUNG TO THE PURPLE MOORS BEHIND AND AROUND THEIR DWELLING TO THE HOLLOW VALE INTO WHICH THE PEBBLY BRIDLE PATH LEADING FROM THEIR GATE DESCENDED AND WHICH WOUND BETWEEN FERN BANKS FIRST AND THEN AMONGST A FEW OF THE WILDEST LITTLE PASTURE FIELDS
100-122655-0005 THAT EVER BORDERED A WILDERNESS OF HEATH OR GAVE SUSTENANCE TO A FLOCK OF GREY MOORLAND SHEEP WITH THEIR LITTLE MOSSY FACED LAMBS THEY CLUNG TO THIS SCENE I SAY WITH A PERFECT ENTHUSIASM OF ATTACHMENT
100-122655-0006 ON THE WILD COLOURING COMMUNICATED TO RIDGE AND DELL BY MOSS BY HEATH BELL BY FLOWER SPRINKLED TURF BY BRILLIANT BRACKEN AND MELLOW GRANITE CRAG THESE DETAILS WERE JUST TO ME WHAT THEY WERE TO THEM
100-122655-0007 DEVELOPED FOR ME IN THESE REGIONS THE SAME ATTRACTION AS FOR THEM WOUND ROUND MY FACULTIES THE SAME SPELL THAT ENTRANCED THEIRS INDOORS WE AGREED EQUALLY WELL
100-122655-0008 THEY WERE BOTH MORE ACCOMPLISHED AND BETTER READ THAN I WAS BUT WITH EAGERNESS I FOLLOWED IN THE PATH OF KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD TRODDEN BEFORE ME I DEVOURED THE BOOKS THEY LENT ME THEN IT WAS FULL SATISFACTION TO DISCUSS WITH THEM IN THE EVENING
100-122655-0009 WHAT I HAD PERUSED DURING THE DAY THOUGHT FITTED THOUGHT OPINION MET OPINION WE COINCIDED IN SHORT PERFECTLY IF IN OUR TRIO THERE WAS A SUPERIOR AND A LEADER IT WAS DIANA PHYSICALLY SHE FAR EXCELLED ME
100-122655-0010 SHE WAS HANDSOME SHE WAS VIGOROUS IN HER ANIMAL SPIRITS THERE WAS AN AFFLUENCE OF LIFE AND CERTAINTY OF FLOW SUCH AS EXCITED MY WONDER WHILE IT BAFFLED MY COMPREHENSION I COULD TALK A WHILE WHEN THE EVENING COMMENCED
100-122655-0011 BUT THE FIRST GUSH OF VIVACITY AND FLUENCY GONE I WAS FAIN TO SIT ON A STOOL AT DIANA'S FEET TO REST MY HEAD ON HER KNEE AND LISTEN ALTERNATELY TO HER AND MARY WHILE THEY SOUNDED THOROUGHLY THE TOPIC ON WHICH I HAD BUT TOUCHED
100-122655-0012 DIANA OFFERED TO TEACH ME GERMAN I LIKED TO LEARN OF HER I SAW THE PART OF INSTRUCTRESS PLEASED AND SUITED HER THAT OF SCHOLAR PLEASED AND SUITED ME NO LESS
100-122655-0013 OUR NATURES DOVETAILED MUTUAL AFFECTION OF THE STRONGEST KIND WAS THE RESULT THEY DISCOVERED I COULD DRAW THEIR PENCILS AND COLOUR BOXES WERE IMMEDIATELY AT MY SERVICE MY SKILL GREATER IN THIS ONE POINT THAN THEIRS SURPRISED AND CHARMED THEM
100-122655-0014 MARY WOULD SIT AND WATCH ME BY THE HOUR TOGETHER THEN SHE WOULD TAKE LESSONS AND A DOCILE INTELLIGENT ASSIDUOUS PUPIL SHE MADE THUS OCCUPIED AND MUTUALLY ENTERTAINED DAYS PASSED LIKE HOURS AND WEEKS LIKE DAYS
100-122655-0015 DID NOT EXTEND TO HIM ONE REASON OF THE DISTANCE YET OBSERVED BETWEEN US WAS THAT HE WAS COMPARATIVELY SELDOM AT HOME A LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS TIME APPEARED DEVOTED TO VISITING THE SICK AND POOR AMONG THE SCATTERED POPULATION OF HIS PARISH
100-122655-0016 NO WEATHER SEEMED TO HINDER HIM IN THESE PASTORAL EXCURSIONS RAIN OR FAIR HE WOULD WHEN HIS HOURS OF MORNING STUDY WERE OVER TAKE HIS HAT AND FOLLOWED BY HIS FATHER'S OLD POINTER CARLO GO OUT ON HIS MISSION OF LOVE OR DUTY
100-122655-0017 I SCARCELY KNOW IN WHICH LIGHT HE REGARDED IT SOMETIMES WHEN THE DAY WAS VERY UNFAVOURABLE HIS SISTERS WOULD EXPOSTULATE HE WOULD THEN SAY WITH A PECULIAR SMILE MORE SOLEMN THAN CHEERFUL
100-122655-0018 AND IF I LET A GUST OF WIND OR A SPRINKLING OF RAIN TURN ME ASIDE FROM THESE EASY TASKS WHAT PREPARATION WOULD SUCH SLOTH BE FOR THE FUTURE I PROPOSE TO MYSELF DIANA AND MARY'S GENERAL ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WAS A SIGH
100-122655-0019 AND SOME MINUTES OF APPARENTLY MOURNFUL MEDITATION BUT BESIDES HIS FREQUENT ABSENCES THERE WAS ANOTHER BARRIER TO FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM HE SEEMED OF A RESERVED AN ABSTRACTED AND EVEN OF A BROODING NATURE
100-122655-0020 ZEALOUS IN HIS MINISTERIAL LABOURS BLAMELESS IN HIS LIFE AND HABITS HE YET DID NOT APPEAR TO ENJOY THAT MENTAL SERENITY THAT INWARD CONTENT WHICH SHOULD BE THE REWARD OF EVERY SINCERE CHRISTIAN AND PRACTICAL PHILANTHROPIST
100-122655-0021 OFTEN OF AN EVENING WHEN HE SAT AT THE WINDOW HIS DESK AND PAPERS BEFORE HIM HE WOULD CEASE READING OR WRITING REST HIS CHIN ON HIS HAND AND DELIVER HIMSELF UP TO I KNOW NOT WHAT COURSE OF THOUGHT
100-122655-0022 BUT THAT IT WAS PERTURBED AND EXCITING MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE FREQUENT FLASH AND CHANGEFUL DILATION OF HIS EYE I THINK MOREOVER THAT NATURE WAS NOT TO HIM
100-122655-0023 HE EXPRESSED ONCE AND BUT ONCE IN MY HEARING A STRONG SENSE OF THE RUGGED CHARM OF THE HILLS AND AN INBORN AFFECTION FOR THE DARK ROOF AND HOARY WALLS HE CALLED HIS HOME
100-122655-0024 BUT THERE WAS MORE OF GLOOM THAN PLEASURE IN THE TONE AND WORDS IN WHICH THE SENTIMENT WAS MANIFESTED AND NEVER DID HE SEEM TO ROAM THE MOORS FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR SOOTHING SILENCE NEVER SEEK OUT OR DWELL UPON THE THOUSAND PEACEFUL DELIGHTS THEY COULD YIELD
100-122655-0025 INCOMMUNICATIVE AS HE WAS SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF GAUGING HIS MIND
100-122655-0026 WHEN I HEARD HIM PREACH IN HIS OWN CHURCH AT MORTON I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE THAT SERMON BUT IT IS PAST MY POWER I CANNOT EVEN RENDER FAITHFULLY THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON ME
100-122655-0027 IT BEGAN CALM AND INDEED AS FAR AS DELIVERY AND PITCH OF VOICE WENT IT WAS CALM TO THE END AN EARNESTLY FELT YET STRICTLY RESTRAINED ZEAL BREATHED SOON IN THE DISTINCT ACCENTS AND PROMPTED THE NERVOUS LANGUAGE
100-122655-0028 THIS GREW TO FORCE COMPRESSED CONDENSED CONTROLLED THE HEART WAS THRILLED THE MIND ASTONISHED BY THE POWER OF THE PREACHER NEITHER WERE SOFTENED THROUGHOUT THERE WAS A STRANGE BITTERNESS AN ABSENCE OF CONSOLATORY GENTLENESS
100-122655-0029 STERN ALLUSIONS TO CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ELECTION PREDESTINATION REPROBATION WERE FREQUENT AND EACH REFERENCE TO THESE POINTS SOUNDED LIKE A SENTENCE PRONOUNCED FOR DOOM
100-122655-0030 HAD SPRUNG FROM A DEPTH WHERE LAY TURBID DREGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHERE MOVED TROUBLING IMPULSES OF INSATIATE YEARNINGS AND DISQUIETING ASPIRATIONS
100-122655-0031 ZEALOUS AS HE WAS HAD NOT YET FOUND THAT PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING HE HAD NO MORE FOUND IT I THOUGHT THAN HAD I WITH MY CONCEALED AND RACKING REGRETS FOR MY BROKEN IDOL AND LOST ELYSIUM
100-122655-0032 REGRETS TO WHICH I HAVE LATTERLY AVOIDED REFERRING BUT WHICH POSSESSED ME AND TYRANNISED OVER ME RUTHLESSLY MEANTIME A MONTH WAS GONE
100-122655-0033 AS GOVERNESSES IN A LARGE FASHIONABLE SOUTH OF ENGLAND CITY WHERE EACH HELD A SITUATION IN FAMILIES
100-122655-0034 AND APPRECIATED ONLY THEIR ACQUIRED ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS THEY APPRECIATED THE SKILL OF THEIR COOK OR THE TASTE OF THEIR WAITING WOMAN
100-122655-0035 ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT HE HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN FOR ME YET IT BECAME URGENT THAT I SHOULD HAVE A VOCATION OF SOME KIND ONE MORNING BEING LEFT ALONE WITH HIM A FEW MINUTES IN THE PARLOUR I VENTURED TO APPROACH THE WINDOW RECESS
100-122655-0036 WHEN HE SAVED ME THE TROUBLE BY BEING THE FIRST TO COMMENCE A DIALOGUE
100-122655-0037 YOU HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK OF ME HE SAID YES I WISH TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE HEARD OF ANY SERVICE I CAN OFFER MYSELF TO UNDERTAKE I FOUND OR DEVISED SOMETHING FOR YOU THREE WEEKS AGO BUT AS YOU SEEMED BOTH USEFUL AND HAPPY HERE
100-122655-0038 AS MY SISTERS HAD EVIDENTLY BECOME ATTACHED TO YOU AND YOUR SOCIETY GAVE THEM UNUSUAL PLEASURE I DEEMED IT INEXPEDIENT TO BREAK IN ON YOUR MUTUAL COMFORT TILL THEIR APPROACHING DEPARTURE FROM MARSH END SHOULD RENDER YOURS NECESSARY
100-122655-0039 AND THEY WILL GO IN THREE DAYS NOW I SAID YES AND WHEN THEY GO I SHALL RETURN TO THE PARSONAGE AT MORTON HANNAH WILL ACCOMPANY ME AND THIS OLD HOUSE WILL BE SHUT UP
100-122655-0040 I WAITED A FEW MOMENTS EXPECTING HE WOULD GO ON WITH THE SUBJECT FIRST BROACHED BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE ENTERED ANOTHER TRAIN OF REFLECTION HIS LOOK DENOTED ABSTRACTION FROM ME AND MY BUSINESS
100-122655-0041 ONE OF CLOSE AND ANXIOUS INTEREST TO ME WHAT IS THE EMPLOYMENT YOU HAD IN VIEW MISTER RIVERS I HOPE THIS DELAY WILL NOT HAVE INCREASED THE DIFFICULTY OF SECURING IT
100-122655-0042 OH NO SINCE IT IS AN EMPLOYMENT WHICH DEPENDS ONLY ON ME TO GIVE AND YOU TO ACCEPT
