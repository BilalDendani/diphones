6690-73075-0000 CHILDREN DO NOT NATURALLY LOVE GOD THEY HAVE NO GREAT CAPACITY FOR AN IDEA SO SUBTLE AND MATURE AS THE IDEA OF GOD WHILE THEY ARE STILL CHILDREN IN A HOME AND CARED FOR LIFE IS TOO KIND AND EASY FOR THEM TO FEEL ANY GREAT NEED OF GOD
6690-73075-0001 ALL THINGS ARE STILL SOMETHING GOD LIKE THE TRUE GOD OUR MODERN MINDS INSIST UPON BELIEVING CAN HAVE NO APPETITE FOR UNNATURAL PRAISE AND ADORATION HE DOES NOT CLAMOUR FOR THE ATTENTION OF CHILDREN
6690-73075-0002 HE IS NOT LIKE ONE OF THOSE SENILE UNCLES WHO DREAM OF GLORY IN THE NURSERY WHO LOVE TO HEAR IT SAID THE CHILDREN ADORE HIM IF CHILDREN ARE LOVED AND TRAINED TO TRUTH JUSTICE AND MUTUAL FORBEARANCE
6690-73075-0003 THEY WILL BE READY FOR THE TRUE GOD AS THEIR NEEDS BRING THEM WITHIN HIS SCOPE THEY SHOULD BE LEFT TO THEIR INNOCENCE AND TO THEIR TRUST IN THE INNOCENCE OF THE WORLD AS LONG AS THEY CAN BE
6690-73075-0004 THEY SHOULD BE TOLD ONLY OF GOD AS A GREAT FRIEND WHOM SOME DAY THEY WILL NEED MORE AND UNDERSTAND AND KNOW BETTER THAT IS AS MUCH AS MOST CHILDREN NEED
6690-73075-0005 YET CHILDREN ARE SOMETIMES VERY NEAR TO GOD CREATIVE PASSION STIRS IN THEIR PLAY AT TIMES THEY DISPLAY A DIVINE SIMPLICITY BUT IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEREFORE THEY SHOULD BE AFFLICTED WITH THEOLOGICAL FORMULAE
6690-73075-0006 OR INDUCTED INTO CEREMONIES AND RITES THAT THEY MAY DISLIKE OR MISINTERPRET IF BY ANY ACCIDENT BY THE DEATH OF A FRIEND OR A DISTRESSING STORY THE THOUGHT OF DEATH AFFLICTS A CHILD THEN HE MAY BEGIN TO HEAR OF GOD
6690-73075-0007 WHO TAKES THOSE THAT SERVE HIM OUT OF THEIR SLAIN BODIES INTO HIS SHINING IMMORTALITY OR IF BY SOME MENIAL TREACHERY THROUGH SOME PROWLING PRIEST THE WHISPER OF OLD BOGEY REACHES OUR CHILDREN
6690-73075-0008 THEN WE MAY SET THEIR MINDS AT EASE BY THE ASSURANCE OF HIS LIMITLESS CHARITY WITH ADOLESCENCE COMES THE DESIRE FOR GOD AND TO KNOW MORE OF GOD AND THAT IS THE MOST SUITABLE TIME FOR RELIGIOUS TALK AND TEACHING
6690-73075-0009 GOD IS NOT SEXUAL IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A VERY CONSIDERABLE DISENTANGLEMENT OF THE IDEA OF GOD FROM THE COMPLEX OF SEXUAL THOUGHT AND FEELING BUT IN THE EARLY DAYS OF RELIGION
6690-73075-0010 THE TWO THINGS WERE INSEPARABLY BOUND TOGETHER THE FURY OF THE HEBREW PROPHETS FOR EXAMPLE IS CONTINUALLY PROCLAIMING THE EXTRAORDINARY WRATH OF THEIR GOD AT THIS OR THAT LITTLE DIRTINESS OR IRREGULARITY OR BREACH OF THE SEXUAL TABUS
6690-73075-0011 THE CEREMONY OF CIRCUMCISION IS CLEARLY INDICATIVE OF THE ORIGINAL NATURE OF THE SEMITIC DEITY WHO DEVELOPED INTO THE TRINITARIAN GOD SO FAR AS CHRISTIANITY DROPPED THIS RITE SO FAR CHRISTIANITY DISAVOWED THE OLD ASSOCIATIONS
6690-73075-0012 BUT TO THIS DAY THE REPRESENTATIVE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES STILL MAKE MARRIAGE INTO A MYSTICAL SACRAMENT AND WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS THE ROMAN COMMUNION EXACTS THE SACRIFICE OF CELIBACY FROM ITS PRIESTHOOD
6690-73075-0013 REGARDLESS OF THE MISCHIEVOUSNESS AND MALICIOUSNESS THAT SO OFTEN ENSUE NEARLY EVERY CHRISTIAN CHURCH INFLICTS AS MUCH DISCREDIT AND INJUSTICE AS IT CAN CONTRIVE UPON THE ILLEGITIMATE CHILD
6690-73075-0014 THEY DO NOT TREAT ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN AS UNFORTUNATE CHILDREN BUT AS CHILDREN WITH A MYSTICAL AND AN INCURABLE TAINT OF SIN KINDLY EASY GOING CHRISTIANS MAY RESENT THIS STATEMENT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT TALLY WITH THEIR OWN ATTITUDES
6690-73075-0015 BUT LET THEM CONSULT THEIR ORTHODOX AUTHORITIES ONE MUST DISTINGUISH CLEARLY HERE BETWEEN WHAT IS HELD TO BE SACRED OR SINFUL IN ITSELF AND WHAT IS HELD TO BE ONE'S DUTY OR A NATION'S DUTY
6690-73075-0016 BECAUSE IT IS IN ITSELF THE WISEST CLEANEST CLEAREST BEST THING TO DO BY THE LATTER TESTS AND REASONABLE ARGUMENTS MOST OR ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS REGULATING THE RELATIONS OF THE SEXES MAY BE JUSTIFIABLE
6690-73075-0017 BUT MY CASE IS NOT WHETHER THEY CAN BE JUSTIFIED BY THESE TESTS BUT THAT IT IS NOT BY THESE TESTS THAT THEY ARE JUDGED EVEN TO DAY BY THE PROFESSORS OF THE CHIEF RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD
6690-73075-0018 IT IS THE TEMPER AND NOT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE RELIGIOUS BODIES THAT I WOULD CRITICISE THESE SEXUAL QUESTIONS ARE GUARDED BY A HOLY IRASCIBILITY AND THE MOST VIOLENT EFFORTS ARE MADE WITH A SENSE OF COMPLETE RIGHTEOUSNESS
6690-73075-0019 TO PROHIBIT THEIR DISCUSSION THAT FURY ABOUT SEXUAL THINGS IS ONLY TO BE EXPLAINED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE CHRISTIAN GOD REMAINS A SEX GOD IN THE MINDS OF GREAT NUMBERS OF HIS EXPONENTS
6690-73075-0020 HIS DISENTANGLEMENT FROM THAT PLEXUS IS INCOMPLETE SEXUAL THINGS ARE STILL TO THE ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN SACRED THINGS NOW THE GOD WHOM THOSE OF THE NEW FAITH ARE FINDING
6690-73075-0021 IS ONLY MEDIATELY CONCERNED WITH THE RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN HE IS NO MORE SEXUAL ESSENTIALLY THAN HE IS ESSENTIALLY DIETETIC OR HYGIENIC THE GOD OF LEVITICUS WAS ALL THESE THINGS
6690-73075-0022 HE IS REPRESENTED AS PRESCRIBING THE MOST PETTY AND INTIMATE OF OBSERVANCES MANY OF WHICH ARE NOW HABITUALLY DISREGARDED BY THE CHRISTIANS WHO PROFESS HIM IT IS PART OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE IDEA OF GOD
6690-73075-0023 THAT WE HAVE NOW SO LARGELY DISENTANGLED OUR CONCEPTION OF HIM FROM THE DIETARY AND REGIMEN AND METICULOUS SEXUAL RULES THAT WERE ONCE INSEPARABLY BOUND UP WITH HIS MAJESTY CHRIST HIMSELF WAS ONE OF THE CHIEF FORCES IN THIS DISENTANGLEMENT
6690-73075-0024 THERE IS THE CLEAREST EVIDENCE IN SEVERAL INSTANCES OF HIS DISREGARD OF THE RULE AND HIS INSISTENCE THAT HIS DISCIPLES SHOULD SEEK FOR THE SPIRIT UNDERLYING AND OFTEN MASKED BY THE RULE HIS CHURCH BEING MADE OF BASER MATTER
6690-73075-0025 HAS FOLLOWED HIM AS RELUCTANTLY AS POSSIBLE AND NO FURTHER THAN IT WAS OBLIGED BUT IT HAS FOLLOWED HIM FAR ENOUGH TO ADMIT HIS PRINCIPLE THAT IN ALL THESE MATTERS THERE IS NO NEED FOR SUPERSTITIOUS FEAR
6690-73075-0026 THAT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DIVINE PURPOSE IS LEFT TO THE UNEMBARRASSED INTELLIGENCE OF MEN THE CHURCH HAS FOLLOWED HIM FAR ENOUGH TO MAKE THE HARSH THREATENINGS OF PRIESTS AND ECCLESIASTICS
6690-73075-0027 AGAINST WHAT THEY ARE PLEASED TO CONSIDER IMPURITY OR SEXUAL IMPIETY A PROFOUND INCONSISTENCY ONE SEEMS TO HEAR THEIR DISTANT PROTESTS WHEN ONE READS OF CHRIST AND THE MAGDALEN OR OF CHRIST EATING WITH PUBLICANS AND SINNERS
6690-73075-0028 THE CLERGY OF OUR OWN DAYS PLAY THE PART OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PHARISEES WITH THE UTMOST EXACTNESS AND COMPLETE UNCONSCIOUSNESS ONE CANNOT IMAGINE A MODERN ECCLESIASTIC CONVERSING WITH A MAGDALEN IN TERMS OF ORDINARY CIVILITY
6690-73075-0029 UNLESS SHE WAS IN A VERY HIGH SOCIAL POSITION INDEED OR BLENDING WITH DISREPUTABLE CHARACTERS WITHOUT A DRAMATIC SENSE OF CONDESCENSION AND MUCH EXPLANATORY BY PLAY THOSE WHO PROFESS MODERN RELIGION
6690-73075-0030 DO BUT FOLLOW IN THESE MATTERS A COURSE ENTIRELY COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT HAS SURVIVED OF THE AUTHENTIC TEACHINGS OF CHRIST WHEN THEY DECLARE THAT GOD IS NOT SEXUAL AND THAT RELIGIOUS PASSION AND INSULT AND PERSECUTION UPON THE SCORE OF SEXUAL THINGS
6690-73075-0031 ARE A BARBARIC INHERITANCE BUT LEST ANYONE SHOULD FLING OFF HERE WITH SOME HASTY ASSUMPTION THAT THOSE WHO PROFESS THE RELIGION OF THE TRUE GOD ARE SEXUALLY ANARCHISTIC
6690-73075-0032 LET STRESS BE LAID AT ONCE UPON THE OPENING SENTENCE OF THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH AND LET ME A LITTLE ANTICIPATE A SECTION WHICH FOLLOWS WE WOULD FREE MEN AND WOMEN FROM EXACT AND SUPERSTITIOUS RULES AND OBSERVANCES
6690-73075-0033 NOT TO MAKE THEM LESS THE INSTRUMENTS OF GOD BUT MORE WHOLLY HIS THE CLAIM OF MODERN RELIGION IS THAT ONE SHOULD GIVE ONESELF UNRESERVEDLY TO GOD THAT THERE IS NO OTHER SALVATION
6690-73075-0034 THE BELIEVER OWES ALL HIS BEING AND EVERY MOMENT OF HIS LIFE TO GOD TO KEEP MIND AND BODY AS CLEAN FINE WHOLESOME ACTIVE AND COMPLETELY AT GOD'S SERVICE AS HE CAN
6690-73075-0035 THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR INDULGENCE OR DISSIPATION IN SUCH A CONSECRATED LIFE IT IS A MATTER BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS CONSCIENCE OR HIS DOCTOR OR HIS SOCIAL UNDERSTANDING WHAT EXACTLY HE MAY DO OR NOT DO
6690-73075-0036 WHAT HE MAY EAT OR DRINK OR SO FORTH UPON ANY OCCASION NOTHING CAN EXONERATE HIM FROM DOING HIS UTMOST TO DETERMINE AND PERFORM THE RIGHT ACT NOTHING CAN EXCUSE HIS FAILURE TO DO SO
6690-73075-0037 BUT WHAT IS HERE BEING INSISTED UPON IS THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS HAS IMMEDIATELY TO DO WITH GOD OR RELIGIOUS EMOTION EXCEPT ONLY THE GENERAL WILL TO DO RIGHT IN GOD'S SERVICE
6690-73075-0038 THE DETAILED INTERPRETATION OF THAT RIGHT IS FOR THE DISPASSIONATE CONSIDERATION OF THE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE ALL THIS IS SET DOWN HERE AS DISTINCTLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL RESERVOIRS OF SEX
6690-73075-0039 AND SEXUAL EXCITEMENT IS ALWAYS TENDING TO LEAK BACK INTO RELIGIOUS FEELING AMONGST THE SEX TORMENTED PRIESTHOOD OF THE ROMAN COMMUNION IN PARTICULAR
6690-73075-0040 AND SUCHLIKE PREDECESSORS OF CHRISTIANITY THERE SEEMS TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARY BELIEF THAT CHASTITY WAS NOT INVENTED UNTIL CHRISTIANITY CAME AND THAT THE RELIGIOUS LIFE IS LARGELY THE PROPITIATION OF GOD BY FEATS OF SEXUAL ABSTINENCE
