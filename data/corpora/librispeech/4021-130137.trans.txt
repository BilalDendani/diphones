4021-130137-0000 ARE EQUAL TO ANY IN SPEED AND COMFORT
4021-130137-0001 BUT TO HAVRE AND THE ADDITIONAL TRIP FROM HAVRE TO SOUTHAMPTON WOULD RENDER PHILEAS FOGG'S LAST EFFORTS OF NO AVAIL THE INMAN STEAMER DID NOT DEPART TILL THE NEXT DAY
4021-130137-0002 WHICH GAVE HIM THE DAILY MOVEMENTS OF THE TRANS ATLANTIC STEAMERS
4021-130137-0003 IT OVERWHELMED HIM TO LOSE THE BOAT BY THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IT WAS HIS FAULT FOR INSTEAD OF HELPING HIS MASTER HE HAD NOT CEASED PUTTING OBSTACLES IN HIS PATH AND WHEN HE RECALLED ALL THE INCIDENTS OF THE TOUR
4021-130137-0004 WHEN HE COUNTED UP THE SUMS EXPENDED IN PURE LOSS AND ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT THE IMMENSE STAKE ADDED TO THE HEAVY CHARGES OF THIS USELESS JOURNEY WOULD COMPLETELY RUIN MISTER FOGG
4021-130137-0005 HE OVERWHELMED HIMSELF WITH BITTER SELF ACCUSATIONS MISTER FOGG HOWEVER DID NOT REPROACH HIM AND ON LEAVING THE CUNARD PIER ONLY SAID WE WILL CONSULT ABOUT WHAT IS BEST TO MORROW COME
4021-130137-0006 THE PARTY CROSSED THE HUDSON IN THE JERSEY CITY FERRYBOAT AND DROVE IN A CARRIAGE TO THE SAINT NICHOLAS HOTEL ON BROADWAY ROOMS WERE ENGAGED AND THE NIGHT PASSED BRIEFLY TO PHILEAS FOGG WHO SLEPT PROFOUNDLY
4021-130137-0007 BUT VERY LONG TO AOUDA AND THE OTHERS WHOSE AGITATION DID NOT PERMIT THEM TO REST THE NEXT DAY WAS THE TWELFTH OF DECEMBER FROM SEVEN IN THE MORNING OF THE TWELFTH TO A QUARTER BEFORE NINE IN THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FIRST
4021-130137-0008 THERE WERE NINE DAYS THIRTEEN HOURS AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES IF PHILEAS FOGG HAD LEFT IN THE CHINA ONE OF THE FASTEST STEAMERS ON THE ATLANTIC HE WOULD HAVE REACHED LIVERPOOL AND THEN LONDON WITHIN THE PERIOD AGREED UPON
4021-130137-0009 MISTER FOGG LEFT THE HOTEL ALONE AFTER GIVING PASSEPARTOUT INSTRUCTIONS TO AWAIT HIS RETURN AND INFORM AOUDA TO BE READY AT AN INSTANT'S NOTICE HE PROCEEDED TO THE BANKS OF THE HUDSON
4021-130137-0010 AND LOOKED ABOUT AMONG THE VESSELS MOORED OR ANCHORED IN THE RIVER FOR ANY THAT WERE ABOUT TO DEPART SEVERAL HAD DEPARTURE SIGNALS AND WERE PREPARING TO PUT TO SEA AT MORNING TIDE
4021-130137-0011 FOR IN THIS IMMENSE AND ADMIRABLE PORT THERE IS NOT ONE DAY IN A HUNDRED THAT VESSELS DO NOT SET OUT FOR EVERY QUARTER OF THE GLOBE BUT THEY WERE MOSTLY SAILING VESSELS OF WHICH OF COURSE PHILEAS FOGG COULD MAKE NO USE
4021-130137-0012 A CABLE'S LENGTH OFF AT MOST A TRADING VESSEL WITH A SCREW WELL SHAPED WHOSE FUNNEL PUFFING A CLOUD OF SMOKE INDICATED THAT SHE WAS GETTING READY FOR DEPARTURE PHILEAS FOGG HAILED A BOAT GOT INTO IT
4021-130137-0013 AND SOON FOUND HIMSELF ON BOARD THE HENRIETTA IRON HULLED WOOD BUILT ABOVE HE ASCENDED TO THE DECK AND ASKED FOR THE CAPTAIN WHO FORTHWITH PRESENTED HIMSELF HE WAS A MAN OF FIFTY A SORT OF SEA WOLF WITH BIG EYES
4021-130137-0014 A COMPLEXION OF OXIDISED COPPER RED HAIR AND THICK NECK AND A GROWLING VOICE THE CAPTAIN ASKED MISTER FOGG I AM THE CAPTAIN I AM PHILEAS FOGG OF LONDON
4021-130137-0015 AND I AM ANDREW SPEEDY OF CARDIFF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT TO SEA IN AN HOUR YOU ARE BOUND FOR BORDEAUX AND YOUR CARGO NO FREIGHT
4021-130137-0016 GOING IN BALLAST HAVE YOU ANY PASSENGERS
4021-130137-0017 IS YOUR VESSEL A SWIFT ONE BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE KNOTS THE HENRIETTA WELL KNOWN WILL YOU CARRY ME AND THREE OTHER PERSONS TO LIVERPOOL TO LIVERPOOL
4021-130137-0018 THE CAPTAIN SPOKE IN A TONE WHICH DID NOT ADMIT OF A REPLY BUT THE OWNERS OF THE HENRIETTA RESUMED PHILEAS FOGG THE OWNERS ARE MYSELF REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
4021-130137-0019 THE VESSEL BELONGS TO ME I WILL FREIGHT IT FOR YOU NO I WILL BUY IT OF YOU NO PHILEAS FOGG DID NOT BETRAY THE LEAST DISAPPOINTMENT
4021-130137-0020 NOW MONEY FAILED STILL SOME MEANS MUST BE FOUND TO CROSS THE ATLANTIC ON A BOAT UNLESS BY BALLOON WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VENTURESOME BESIDES NOT BEING CAPABLE OF BEING PUT IN PRACTICE
4021-130137-0021 IT SEEMED THAT PHILEAS FOGG HAD AN IDEA FOR HE SAID TO THE CAPTAIN WELL WILL YOU CARRY ME TO BORDEAUX NO NOT IF YOU PAID ME TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
4021-130137-0022 I OFFER YOU TWO THOUSAND APIECE APIECE
4021-130137-0023 FOUR CAPTAIN SPEEDY BEGAN TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD THERE WERE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GAIN WITHOUT CHANGING HIS ROUTE FOR WHICH IT WAS WELL WORTH CONQUERING THE REPUGNANCE HE HAD FOR ALL KINDS OF PASSENGERS
4021-130137-0024 BESIDES PASSENGERS AT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE NO LONGER PASSENGERS BUT VALUABLE MERCHANDISE I START AT NINE O'CLOCK SAID CAPTAIN SPEEDY SIMPLY ARE YOU AND YOUR PARTY READY
4021-130137-0025 WE WILL BE ON BOARD AT NINE O'CLOCK REPLIED NO LESS SIMPLY MISTER FOGG IT WAS HALF PAST EIGHT TO DISEMBARK FROM THE HENRIETTA JUMP INTO A HACK HURRY TO THE SAINT NICHOLAS AND RETURN WITH AOUDA
4021-130137-0026 AND EVEN THE INSEPARABLE FIX WAS THE WORK OF A BRIEF TIME AND WAS PERFORMED BY MISTER FOGG WITH THE COOLNESS WHICH NEVER ABANDONED HIM THEY WERE ON BOARD WHEN THE HENRIETTA MADE READY TO WEIGH ANCHOR
4021-130137-0027 HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND WOULD CERTAINLY NOT COME OUT OF THIS AFFAIR WELL INDEMNIFIED
