5389-4861-0000 HE COMMANDED HIS SERVANTS TO PITCH TENTS IN THE OPEN FIELD AND THERE AWAIT THE COOL OF THE EVENING SUDDENLY A FRIGHTFUL THIRST SEIZED THE KING AND AS HE SAW NO WATER NEAR
5389-4861-0001 HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURHOOD LOOKING FOR A SPRING BEFORE LONG HE CAME TO A WELL FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH WATER CLEAR AS CRYSTAL AND ON THE BOSOM OF WHICH A GOLDEN JUG WAS FLOATING
5389-4861-0002 KING KOJATA AT ONCE TRIED TO SEIZE THE VESSEL BUT THOUGH HE ENDEAVOURED TO GRASP IT WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AND THEN WITH HIS LEFT THE WRETCHED THING ALWAYS ELUDED HIS EFFORTS AND REFUSED TO LET ITSELF BE CAUGHT
5389-4861-0003 BUT LIKE A FISH THE GOBLET ALWAYS SLIPPED THROUGH HIS FINGERS
5389-4861-0004 WHO'S THERE LET ME GO CRIED KING KOJATA BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER ONLY AN AWFUL FACE LOOKED UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL
5389-4861-0005 I WILL ONLY LET YOU GO ON CONDITION THAT YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AND WHICH YOU WILL FIND ON YOUR RETURN HOME THE KING DIDN'T PAUSE TO PONDER LONG FOR WHAT THOUGHT HE
5389-4861-0006 THE THING IS ABSURD SO HE ANSWERED QUICKLY YES I PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE IT THE VOICE REPLIED VERY WELL
5389-4861-0007 HOLDING A LITTLE CRADLE IN HIS HANDS
5389-4861-0008 THEN THE WHOLE THING DAWNED ON THE KING AND GROANING DEEPLY HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
5389-4861-0009 AND THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS ALL THE COURTIERS STANDING ROUND WERE MUCH AMAZED AT THE KING'S GRIEF BUT NO ONE DARED TO ASK HIM THE CAUSE OF IT HE TOOK THE CHILD IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED IT TENDERLY
5389-4861-0010 THEN LAYING IT IN ITS CRADLE HE DETERMINED TO CONTROL HIS EMOTION AND BEGAN TO REIGN AGAIN AS BEFORE THE SECRET OF THE KING REMAINED A SECRET THOUGH HIS GRAVE CAREWORN EXPRESSION ESCAPED NO ONE'S NOTICE
5389-4861-0011 IN THE CONSTANT DREAD THAT HIS CHILD WOULD BE TAKEN FROM HIM POOR KOJATA KNEW NO REST NIGHT OR DAY HOWEVER TIME WENT ON AND NOTHING HAPPENED DAYS AND MONTHS AND YEARS PASSED
5389-4861-0012 AND FOUND HIMSELF QUITE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DARK WOOD
5389-4861-0013 THAT IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THROUGH THEM ONLY STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM LAY A LITTLE PATCH OF MEADOWLAND OVERGROWN WITH THISTLES AND RANK WEEDS IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH A LEAFY LIME TREE REARED ITSELF
5389-4861-0014 SUDDENLY A RUSTLING SOUND WAS HEARD IN THE HOLLOW OF THE TREE AND AN EXTRAORDINARY OLD MAN WITH GREEN EYES AND CHIN CREPT OUT OF IT A FINE DAY PRINCE MILAN HE SAID
5389-4861-0015 YOU'VE KEPT ME WAITING A GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR YOU TO COME AND PAY ME A VISIT WHO ARE YOU IN THE NAME OF WONDER DEMANDED THE ASTONISHED PRINCE YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH
5389-4861-0016 FAREWELL FOR THE PRESENT WE SHALL MEET AGAIN WITH THESE WORDS THE OLD MAN DISAPPEARED INTO THE TREE AND THE PRINCE RETURNED HOME RATHER STARTLED AND TOLD HIS FATHER ALL THAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD
5389-4861-0017 THE KING GREW AS WHITE AS A SHEET WHEN HE HEARD THE PRINCE'S STORY AND SAID WOE IS ME MY SON THE TIME HAS COME WHEN WE MUST PART
5389-4861-0018 AND AFTER MUCH WEEPING AND LAMENTATION THE PRINCE BADE THEM ALL FAREWELL AND SET FORTH ON HIS JOURNEY HE RODE STRAIGHT ON FOR TWO DAYS AND ON THE THIRD HE CAME TO A LAKE AS SMOOTH AS GLASS
5389-4861-0019 AND AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL NOT A BREATH OF WIND MOVED NOT A LEAF STIRRED ALL WAS SILENT AS THE GRAVE ONLY ON THE STILL BOSOM OF THE LAKE THIRTY DUCKS WITH BRILLIANT PLUMAGE
5389-4861-0020 SWAM ABOUT IN THE WATER NOT FAR FROM THE SHORE PRINCE MILAN NOTICED THIRTY LITTLE WHITE GARMENTS LYING ON THE GRASS AND DISMOUNTING FROM HIS HORSE HE CREPT DOWN UNDER THE HIGH BULRUSHES TOOK ONE OF THE GARMENTS
5389-4861-0021 AND HID HIMSELF WITH IT BEHIND THE BUSHES WHICH GREW ROUND THE LAKE THE DUCKS SWAM ABOUT ALL OVER THE PLACE DIVED DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS AND ROSE AGAIN AND GLIDED THROUGH THE WAVES AT LAST
5389-4861-0022 THAT HE CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE BULRUSHES TO SEE IF HE COULD BE OF ANY HELP AS SOON AS THE DUCK PERCEIVED HIM IT CRIED IN A HUMAN VOICE OH DEAR PRINCE MILAN FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN GIVE ME BACK MY GARMENT
5389-4861-0023 AND I WILL BE SO GRATEFUL TO YOU THE PRINCE LAY THE LITTLE GARMENT ON THE BANK BESIDE HER AND STEPPED BACK INTO THE BUSHES IN A FEW SECONDS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN A WHITE ROBE STOOD BEFORE HIM
5389-4861-0024 SO FAIR AND SWEET AND YOUNG THAT NO PEN COULD DESCRIBE HER SHE GAVE THE PRINCE HER HAND AND SPOKE MANY THANKS PRINCE MILAN FOR YOUR COURTESY I AM THE DAUGHTER OF A WICKED MAGICIAN

5389-4861-0027 AND THEY BOTH SANK DOWN INTO THE LOWER WORLD THE PALACE OF THE MAGICIAN WAS ALL HEWN OUT OF A SINGLE CARBUNCLE LIGHTING UP THE WHOLE SURROUNDING REGION AND PRINCE MILAN WALKED INTO IT GAILY
5389-4861-0028 HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES THE MAGICIAN STAMPED LOUDLY WITH HIS FEET GLARED FRIGHTFULLY OUT OF HIS GREEN EYES AND CURSED SO LOUDLY THAT THE WHOLE UNDERWORLD SHOOK BUT THE PRINCE MINDFUL OF THE COUNSEL HE HAD BEEN GIVEN
5389-4861-0029 WASN'T THE LEAST AFRAID AND APPROACHED THE THRONE STILL ON HIS KNEES AT LAST THE MAGICIAN LAUGHED ALOUD AND SAID
5389-4861-0030 I WON'T BE YOUR ENEMY ANY MORE WELCOME TO THE UNDERWORLD ALL THE SAME FOR YOUR DELAY IN COMING HERE WE MUST DEMAND THREE SERVICES FROM YOU
5389-4861-0031 EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THE MAGICIAN SENT FOR HIM AND SAID
5389-4861-0032 WITH FISH PONDS AND ARTISTIC WATERFALLS IF YOU DO ALL THIS I WILL REWARD YOU RICHLY BUT IF YOU DON'T YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR HEAD
5389-4861-0033 OH YOU WICKED MONSTER THOUGHT PRINCE MILAN YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE PUT ME TO DEATH AT ONCE SADLY HE RETURNED TO HIS ROOM AND WITH BENT HEAD

5389-4861-0038 AND SO IT ALL TURNED OUT JUST AS SHE HAD SAID AS SOON AS IT WAS DAYLIGHT PRINCE MILAN STEPPED OUT OF HIS ROOM AND FOUND A PALACE WHICH WAS QUITE A WORK OF ART DOWN TO THE VERY SMALLEST DETAIL
5389-4861-0039 NOW I MUST SEE IF YOU ARE EQUALLY ACCOMPLISHED WITH YOUR HEAD
5389-4861-0040 ALL BEAUTIFUL PRINCESSES TO MORROW I WILL PLACE THE WHOLE THIRTY IN A ROW YOU MUST WALK PAST THEM THREE TIMES AND THE THIRD TIME YOU MUST SHOW ME WHICH IS MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER HYACINTHIA

5389-4861-0044 HIS DAUGHTERS WERE ALL ARRANGED IN A STRAIGHT ROW IN FRONT OF HIM DRESSED EXACTLY ALIKE
5389-4861-0045 HYACINTHIA PRINCE MILAN WENT PAST THEM AND LOOKED AT THEM CLOSELY BUT THEY WERE ALL SO PRECISELY ALIKE THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE ONE FACE REFLECTED IN THIRTY MIRRORS
5389-4861-0046 AND THE FLY WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THE SECOND TIME HE PASSED THEM
5389-4861-0047 BUT THE THIRD TIME HE PERCEIVED A LITTLE FLY STEALING DOWN ONE CHEEK CAUSING IT TO BLUSH A FAINT PINK THEN THE PRINCE SEIZED THE GIRL'S HAND AND CRIED OUT THIS IS THE PRINCESS HYACINTHIA
5389-4861-0048 BUT I'VE STILL ANOTHER TASK FOR YOU TO DO BEFORE THIS CANDLE WHICH I SHALL LIGHT BURNS TO THE SOCKET YOU MUST HAVE MADE ME A PAIR OF BOOTS REACHING TO MY KNEES
5389-4861-0049 IF THEY AREN'T FINISHED IN THAT TIME OFF COMES YOUR HEAD THE PRINCE RETURNED TO HIS ROOM IN DESPAIR THEN THE PRINCESS HYACINTHIA
5389-4861-0050 CAME TO HIM ONCE MORE CHANGED INTO THE LIKENESS OF A BEE AND ASKED HIM WHY SO SAD PRINCE MILAN HOW CAN I HELP BEING SAD YOUR FATHER HAS SET ME THIS TIME AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK
5389-4861-0051 BEFORE A CANDLE WHICH HE HAS LIT BURNS TO THE SOCKET I AM TO MAKE A PAIR OF BOOTS BUT WHAT DOES A PRINCE KNOW OF SHOEMAKING IF I CAN'T DO IT I LOSE MY HEAD AND
5389-4861-0052 WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO ASKED HYACINTHIA WELL WHAT IS THERE TO BE DONE WHAT HE DEMANDS I CAN'T AND WON'T DO

5389-4861-0054 FOR THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF ESCAPE WITH THESE WORDS SHE BREATHED ON THE WINDOW AND HER BREATH FROZE ON THE PANE THEN SHE LED MILAN OUT OF THE ROOM WITH HER SHUT THE DOOR AND THREW THE KEY AWAY
5389-4861-0055 THE HORSE NO SOONER RECOGNIZED HIS MASTER THAN IT NEIGHED LOUDLY WITH JOY AND SPRINGING TOWARDS HIM IT STOOD AS IF ROOTED TO THE GROUND WHILE PRINCE MILAN AND HYACINTHIA JUMPED ON ITS BACK
5389-4861-0056 THEN IT SPED ONWARDS LIKE AN ARROW FROM A BOW IN THE MEANTIME THE MAGICIAN WAS WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR THE PRINCE ENRAGED BY THE DELAY HE SENT HIS SERVANTS TO FETCH HIM FOR THE APPOINTED TIME WAS PAST
5389-4861-0057 THE SERVANTS CAME TO THE DOOR AND FINDING IT LOCKED THEY KNOCKED BUT THE FROZEN BREATH
5389-4861-0058 I AM COMING DIRECTLY WITH THIS ANSWER THEY RETURNED TO THE MAGICIAN BUT WHEN THE PRINCE STILL DID NOT APPEAR AFTER A TIME HE SENT HIS SERVANTS A SECOND TIME TO BRING HIM THE FROZEN BREATH
5389-4861-0059 OUT OF HIS MIND WITH RAGE THE MAGICIAN ORDERED THE PRINCE TO BE PURSUED THEN A WILD CHASE BEGAN I HEAR HORSES HOOFS BEHIND US SAID HYACINTHIA TO THE PRINCE
5389-4861-0060 MILAN SPRANG FROM THE SADDLE PUT HIS EAR TO THE GROUND AND LISTENED YES HE ANSWERED THEY ARE PURSUING US AND ARE QUITE CLOSE THEN NO TIME MUST BE LOST SAID HYACINTHIA
5389-4861-0061 AND SHE IMMEDIATELY TURNED HERSELF INTO A RIVER PRINCE MILAN INTO AN IRON BRIDGE AND THE CHARGER INTO A BLACKBIRD BEHIND THE BRIDGE THE ROAD BRANCHED OFF INTO THREE WAYS
5389-4861-0062 THE MAGICIAN'S SERVANTS HURRIED AFTER THE FRESH TRACKS BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE BRIDGE THEY STOOD NOT KNOWING WHICH ROAD TO TAKE AS THE FOOTPRINTS STOPPED SUDDENLY AND THERE WERE THREE PATHS FOR THEM TO CHOOSE FROM
5389-4861-0063 FOOLS THE RIVER AND BRIDGE WERE THEY GO BACK AND BRING THEM TO ME AT ONCE OR IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU THEN THE PURSUIT BEGAN AFRESH I HEAR HORSES HOOFS
5389-4861-0064 WHERE A THOUSAND PATHS AND ROADS CROSSED EACH OTHER THEIR PURSUERS ENTERED THE FOREST BUT SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR PRINCE MILAN AND HIS BRIDE AT LAST THEY FOUND THEMSELVES BACK AT THE SAME SPOT THEY HAD STARTED FROM
5389-4861-0065 ONCE MORE THE BEAUTIFUL HYACINTHIA MURMURED I HEAR HORSES HOOFS QUITE NEAR AND THE PRINCE ANSWERED THEY ARE PURSUING US HOTLY AND ARE QUITE CLOSE
5389-4861-0066 WE ARE LOST NOW FOR THAT IS MY FATHER HIMSELF BUT AT THE FIRST CHURCH WE COME TO HIS POWER CEASES HE MAY CHASE US NO FURTHER HAND ME YOUR CROSS
5389-4861-0067 PRINCE MILAN LOOSENED FROM HIS NECK THE LITTLE GOLD CROSS HIS MOTHER HAD GIVEN HIM AND AS SOON AS HYACINTHIA GRASPED IT SHE HAD CHANGED HERSELF INTO A CHURCH MILAN INTO A MONK AND THE HORSE INTO A BELFRY
5389-4861-0068 HE ASKED THE MONK PRINCE MILAN AND PRINCESS HYACINTHIA HAVE JUST GONE ON THIS MINUTE THEY STOPPED FOR A FEW MINUTES IN THE CHURCH TO SAY THEIR PRAYERS AND BADE ME LIGHT THIS WAX CANDLE FOR YOU AND GIVE YOU THEIR LOVE
5389-4861-0069 SAID THE MAGICIAN AND MADE ALL HASTE HOME WHERE HE HAD EVERY ONE OF HIS SERVANTS BEATEN TO WITHIN AN INCH OF THEIR LIVES PRINCE MILAN RODE ON SLOWLY WITH HIS BRIDE WITHOUT FEARING ANY FURTHER PURSUIT
5389-4861-0070 THE SUN WAS JUST SETTING AND ITS LAST RAYS LIT UP A LARGE CITY THEY WERE APPROACHING PRINCE MILAN WAS SUDDENLY SEIZED WITH AN ARDENT DESIRE TO ENTER THE TOWN OH MY BELOVED IMPLORED HYACINTHIA
5389-4861-0071 WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF ASKED THE PRINCE WE'LL ONLY GO AND LOOK AT WHAT'S TO BE SEEN IN THE TOWN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN WE'LL CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY TO MY FATHER'S KINGDOM THE TOWN IS EASY TO GET INTO
5389-4861-0072 BUT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF SIGHED HYACINTHIA BUT LET IT BE AS YOU WISH GO AND I WILL AWAIT YOU HERE BUT I WILL FIRST CHANGE MYSELF INTO A WHITE MILESTONE
5389-4861-0073 ONLY I PRAY YOU BE VERY CAREFUL THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE TOWN WILL COME OUT TO MEET YOU LEADING A LITTLE CHILD WITH THEM WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T KISS THE CHILD OR YOU WILL FORGET ME
5389-4861-0074 AND ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED TO US I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE FOR THREE DAYS THE PRINCE HURRIED TO THE TOWN BUT HYACINTHIA REMAINED BEHIND DISGUISED AS A WHITE MILESTONE ON THE ROAD THE FIRST DAY PASSED
5389-4861-0075 INTO A LITTLE BLUE FIELD FLOWER SHE SAID I WILL GROW HERE ON THE WAYSIDE TILL SOME PASSER BY TRAMPLES ME UNDER FOOT
5389-4861-0076 AND ONE OF HER TEARS REMAINED AS A DEWDROP AND SPARKLED ON THE LITTLE BLUE FLOWER NOW IT HAPPENED SHORTLY AFTER THIS THAT AN OLD MAN PASSED BY
5389-4861-0077 HE PULLED IT UP CAREFULLY BY THE ROOTS AND CARRIED IT HOME HERE HE PLANTED IT IN A POT AND WATERED AND TENDED THE LITTLE PLANT CAREFULLY AND NOW THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING HAPPENED
5389-4861-0078 AT FIRST HE WAS SO SURPRISED HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK BUT AFTER A TIME HE GREW A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE AND WENT TO AN OLD WITCH TO ASK FOR ADVICE THE WITCH SAID GET UP BEFORE THE COCK CROWS
5389-4861-0079 AND WATCH CAREFULLY TILL YOU SEE SOMETHING MOVE AND THEN THROW THIS CLOTH QUICKLY OVER IT AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN ALL NIGHT THE OLD MAN NEVER CLOSED AN EYE WHEN THE FIRST RAY OF LIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM
5389-4861-0080 THE BEAUTIFUL HYACINTHIA CRIED BITTERLY WHEN SHE HEARD THIS THEN SHE DRIED HER TEARS AND WENT INTO THE TOWN DRESSED AS A PEASANT WOMAN SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE KING'S KITCHEN
5389-4861-0081 WHERE THE WHITE APRONED COOKS WERE RUNNING ABOUT IN GREAT CONFUSION THE PRINCESS WENT UP TO THE HEAD COOK AND SAID DEAR COOK PLEASE LISTEN TO MY REQUEST AND LET ME MAKE A WEDDING CAKE FOR PRINCE MILAN
5389-4861-0082 THE BUSY COOK WAS JUST GOING TO REFUSE HER DEMAND AND ORDER HER OUT OF THE KITCHEN BUT THE WORDS DIED ON HIS LIPS WHEN HE TURNED AND BEHELD THE BEAUTIFUL HYACINTHIA AND HE ANSWERED POLITELY
5389-4861-0083 AND I MYSELF WILL LAY IT BEFORE PRINCE MILAN THE CAKE WAS SOON MADE THE INVITED GUESTS WERE ALREADY THRONGING ROUND THE TABLE WHEN THE HEAD COOK ENTERED THE ROOM BEARING A BEAUTIFUL WEDDING CAKE
5389-4861-0084 MILAN SIGHED DEEPLY WHEN HE HEARD WHAT THE LITTLE DOVE SAID THEN HE JUMPED UP SUDDENLY FROM THE TABLE AND RAN TO THE DOOR WHERE HE FOUND THE BEAUTIFUL HYACINTHIA WAITING FOR HIM
