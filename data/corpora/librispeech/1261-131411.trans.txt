1261-131411-0000 WERE THE PRINCIPAL THEATRE ON WHICH THE APOSTLE OF THE GENTILES DISPLAYED HIS ZEAL AND PIETY THE SEEDS OF THE GOSPEL WHICH HE HAD SCATTERED IN A FERTILE SOIL WERE DILIGENTLY CULTIVATED BY HIS DISCIPLES AND IT SHOULD SEEM THAT
1261-131411-0001 TO THESE DOMESTIC TESTIMONIES WE MAY ADD THE CONFESSION THE COMPLAINTS AND THE APPREHENSIONS OF THE GENTILES THEMSELVES
1261-131411-0002 AND THAT THE CHRISTIANS HOWEVER MULTIPLIED BY ZEAL AND POWER DID NOT EXCEED A FIFTH PART OF THAT GREAT CITY HOW DIFFERENT A PROPORTION MUST WE ADOPT WHEN WE COMPARE THE PERSECUTED WITH THE TRIUMPHANT CHURCH
1261-131411-0003 THE WEST WITH THE EAST REMOTE VILLAGES WITH POPULOUS TOWNS AND COUNTRIES RECENTLY CONVERTED TO THE FAITH
1261-131411-0004 WHOEVER WAS GUILTY OR SUSPECTED MIGHT HOPE
1261-131411-0005 IT WAS LIKEWISE APPREHENDED THAT A VERY GREAT MULTITUDE AS IT WERE ANOTHER PEOPLE
1261-131411-0006 AND IN A FORMER INSTANCE OF PLINY
1261-131411-0007 THE CHURCH OF ROME WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FIRST AND MOST POPULOUS OF THE EMPIRE AND WE ARE POSSESSED OF AN AUTHENTIC RECORD WHICH ATTESTS THE STATE OF RELIGION IN THAT CITY ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE THIRD CENTURY AND AFTER A PEACE OF THIRTY EIGHT YEARS
1261-131411-0008 THE CLERGY AT THAT TIME CONSISTED OF A BISHOP FORTY SIX PRESBYTERS SEVEN DEACONS
1261-131411-0009 YET NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY FAVORABLE
1261-131411-0010 THE PRACTICE INTRODUCED INTO THAT PROVINCE OF APPOINTING BISHOPS TO THE MOST INCONSIDERABLE TOWNS AND VERY FREQUENTLY TO THE MOST OBSCURE VILLAGES CONTRIBUTED TO MULTIPLY THE SPLENDOR AND IMPORTANCE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES
1261-131411-0011 DIRECTED BY THE ABILITIES OF CYPRIAN AND ADORNED BY THE ELOQUENCE OF LACTANTIUS BUT IF ON THE CONTRARY WE TURN OUR EYES TOWARDS GAUL
1261-131411-0012 AND EVEN AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF DECIUS WE ARE ASSURED THAT IN A FEW CITIES ONLY
1261-131411-0013 FROM GAUL WHICH CLAIMED A JUST PREEMINENCE OF LEARNING AND AUTHORITY OVER ALL THE COUNTRIES ON THIS SIDE OF THE ALPS
1261-131411-0014 THE MIRACULOUS SHRINE OF COMPOSTELLA DISPLAYED HIS POWER AND THE SWORD OF A MILITARY ORDER
1261-131411-0015 A PEOPLE WHETHER GREEK OR BARBARIAN OR ANY OTHER RACE OF MEN BY WHATSOEVER APPELLATION OR MANNERS THEY MAY BE DISTINGUISHED HOWEVER IGNORANT OF ARTS OR AGRICULTURE WHETHER THEY DWELL UNDER TENTS OR WANDER ABOUT IN COVERED WAGONS
1261-131411-0016 WHICH EVEN AT PRESENT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE WITH THE REAL STATE OF MANKIND CAN BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS THE RASH SALLY OF A DEVOUT BUT CARELESS WRITER THE MEASURE OF WHOSE BELIEF WAS REGULATED BY THAT OF HIS WISHES
1261-131411-0017 BUT NEITHER THE BELIEF NOR THE WISHES OF THE FATHERS CAN ALTER THE TRUTH OF HISTORY
