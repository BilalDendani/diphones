8195-117382-0000 WET YEAR WET YEAR PROPHESIED THE CARDINAL THE SUMAC SEEMED TO FILL HIS IDEA OF A PERFECT LOCATION FROM THE VERY FIRST HE PERCHED ON A LIMB AND BETWEEN DRESSING HIS PLUMAGE
8195-117382-0001 HE KNEW HOW TO TURN HIS CRIMSON SUIT INTO THE MOST PERFECT OF WATER PROOF COATS
8195-117382-0002 SLEEKED HIS FEATHERS AND BREASTING THE APRIL DOWNPOUR KEPT ON CALLING FOR RAIN HE KNEW HE WOULD APPEAR BRIGHTER WHEN IT WAS PAST
8195-117382-0003 WOULD BRING NEARER HIS HEART'S DESIRE HE WAS A VERY BEAU BRUMMEL WHILE HE WAITED FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT HE BATHED DRESSED HIS FEATHERS SUNNED HIMSELF FLUFFED AND FLIRTED HE STRUTTED AND CHIPPED
8195-117382-0004 INCESSANTLY HE CLAIMED THAT SUMAC FOR HIS VERY OWN AND STOUTLY BATTLED FOR POSSESSION WITH MANY INTRUDERS IT GREW ON A DENSELY WOODED SLOPE
8195-117382-0005 THAT ATTRACTED HOMESTEAD SEEKERS A SOBER PAIR OF ROBINS BEGAN LAYING THEIR FOUNDATIONS THERE THE MORNING THE CARDINAL ARRIVED
8195-117382-0006 HE HAD LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE ROBINS THEY WERE EASILY CONQUERED
8195-117382-0007 IN A WILD PLUM TREE BUT THE AIR WAS THICK WITH CHIPS CHATTER AND RED AND BLACK FEATHERS BEFORE THE BLACKBIRDS ACKNOWLEDGED DEFEAT THEY WERE OLD TIMERS AND KNEW ABOUT THE GRUBS AND THE YOUNG CORN
8195-117382-0008 BUT THEY ALSO KNEW WHEN THEY WERE BEATEN SO THEY MOVED DOWN STREAM TO A SCRUB OAK TRYING TO ASSURE EACH OTHER
8195-117382-0009 THE CARDINAL WAS LEFT BOASTING AND STRUTTING IN THE SUMAC BUT IN HIS HEART HE FOUND IT LONESOME BUSINESS BEING THE SON OF A KING HE WAS MUCH TOO DIGNIFIED TO BEG FOR A MATE AND BESIDES IT TOOK ALL HIS TIME TO GUARD THE SUMAC
8195-117382-0010 BUT HIS EYES WERE WIDE OPEN TO ALL THAT WENT ON AROUND HIM AND HE ENVIED THE BLACKBIRD HIS GLOSSY DEVOTED LITTLE SWEETHEART WITH ALL HIS MIGHT HE ALMOST STRAINED HIS VOICE TRYING TO RIVAL THE LOVE SONG OF A SKYLARK
8195-117382-0011 BENEATH THE MAPLES THE CARDINAL WAS TORN BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS HE WAS ALONE HE WAS LOVE SICK AND HE WAS HOLDING THE FINEST BUILDING LOCATION BESIDE THE SHINING RIVER FOR HIS MATE
8195-117382-0012 AND HER SLOWNESS IN COMING MADE THEIR DEVOTION DIFFICULT TO ENDURE WHEN HE COVETED A TRUE LOVE BUT IT SEEMED TO THE CARDINAL THAT HE NEVER COULD SO FORGET HIMSELF AS TO EMULATE THE EXAMPLE OF THAT DOVE LOVER
8195-117382-0013 THE DOVE HAD NO DIGNITY HE WAS SO EFFUSIVE HE WAS A NUISANCE HE KEPT HIS DIGNIFIED QUAKER MATE STUFFED TO DISCOMFORT HE CLUNG TO THE SIDE OF THE NEST TRYING TO HELP BROOD
8195-117382-0014 HE PESTERED HER WITH CARESSES AND COOED OVER HIS LOVE SONG UNTIL EVERY CHIPMUNK ON THE LINE FENCE WAS FAMILIAR WITH HIS STORY THE CARDINAL'S TEMPER WAS WORN TO SUCH A FINE EDGE
8195-117382-0015 THAT HE DARTED AT THE DOVE ONE DAY AND PULLED A BIG TUFT OF FEATHERS FROM HIS BACK WHEN HE HAD RETURNED TO THE SUMAC HE WAS COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT HIS ANGER
8195-117382-0016 EVERY MORNING BROUGHT NEW ARRIVALS TRIM YOUNG FEMALES FRESH FROM THEIR LONG HOLIDAY AND BIG BOASTFUL MALES APPEARING THEIR BRIGHTEST AND BRAVEST EACH SINGER ALMOST SPLITTING HIS THROAT IN THE EFFORT
8195-117382-0017 TO CAPTIVATE THE MATE HE COVETED
8195-117382-0018 GOLD BLUE AND BLACK ROCKING ON THE WILLOWS SPLASHING IN THE WATER BURSTING INTO JETS OF MELODY MAKING EVERY POSSIBLE DISPLAY OF THEIR BEAUTY AND MUSIC AND AT TIMES FIGHTING FIERCELY WHEN THEY DISCOVERED
8195-117382-0019 THAT THE FEMALES THEY WERE WOOING FAVOURED THEIR RIVALS AND DESIRED ONLY TO BE FRIENDLY WITH THEM THE HEART OF THE CARDINAL SANK AS HE WATCHED THERE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILY AMONG THEM
8195-117382-0020 HE PITIED HIMSELF AS HE WONDERED IF FATE HAD IN STORE FOR HIM THE TRIALS HE SAW OTHERS SUFFERING THOSE DREADFUL FEATHERED FEMALES HOW THEY COQUETTED HOW THEY FLIRTED
8195-117382-0021 HOW THEY SLEEKED AND FLATTENED THEIR PLUMAGE AND WITH HALF OPEN BEAKS AND SPARKLING EYES HOPPED CLOSER AND CLOSER AS IF CHARMED THE EAGER SINGERS WITH SWELLING THROATS SANG AND SANG
8195-117382-0022 IN A VERY FRENZY OF EXTRAVAGANT PLEADING
8195-117382-0023 FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS THE CARDINAL HAD BEEN WATCHING HIS COUSIN ROSE BREASTED
8195-117382-0024 WHO APPARENTLY ENCOURAGED HIS ADVANCES ONLY TO SEE HIM LEFT SITTING AS BLUE AND DISCONSOLATE AS ANY HUMAN LOVER WHEN HE DISCOVERS THAT THE MAID
8195-117382-0025 BELONGS TO ANOTHER MAN THE CARDINAL FLEW TO THE VERY TOP OF THE HIGHEST SYCAMORE AND LOOKED ACROSS COUNTRY TOWARD THE LIMBERLOST SHOULD HE GO THERE SEEKING A SWAMP MATE AMONG HIS KINDRED
8195-117382-0026 IT WAS NOT AN ENDURABLE THOUGHT TO BE SURE MATTERS WERE BECOMING SERIOUS NO BIRD BESIDE THE SHINING RIVER HAD PLUMED PARADED OR MADE MORE MUSIC THAN HE WAS IT ALL TO BE WASTED
8195-117382-0027 AND GAZE AT HIM WITH UNCONCEALED ADMIRATION NO DOUBT SHE DEVOUTLY WISHED HER PLAIN PUDGY HUSBAND WORE A SCARLET COAT BUT IT IS PRAISE FROM ONE'S OWN SEX THAT IS PRAISE INDEED
8195-117382-0028 THAT HE WAS A PRINCE INDEED AND HE DECIDED TO REMAIN IN HIS CHOSEN LOCATION AND WITH HIS PHYSICAL AND VOCAL ATTRACTIONS COMPEL THE FINEST LITTLE CARDINAL IN THE FIELDS TO SEEK HIM
8195-117382-0029 HE PLANNED IT ALL VERY CAREFULLY HOW SHE WOULD HEAR HIS SPLENDID MUSIC AND COME TO TAKE A PEEP AT HIM HOW SHE WOULD BE CAPTIVATED BY HIS SIZE AND BEAUTY HOW SHE WOULD COME TIMIDLY
8195-117382-0030 BUT COME OF COURSE FOR HIS APPROVAL HOW HE WOULD CONDESCEND TO ACCEPT HER IF SHE PLEASED HIM IN ALL PARTICULARS
8195-117382-0031 FOR THE SUMAC WAS IN A LOVELY SPOT FOR SCENERY AS WELL AS NEST BUILDING FOR SEVERAL DAYS HE HAD BOASTED HE HAD BANTERED
8195-117382-0032 HE HAD ON THIS LAST DAY ALMOST CONDESCENDED TO COAXING BUT NOT ONE LITTLE BRIGHT EYED CARDINAL FEMALE HAD COME TO OFFER HERSELF THE PERFORMANCE OF A BROWN THRUSH DROVE HIM WILD WITH ENVY
8195-117382-0033 THERE WAS NO WAY TO IMPROVE THAT MUSIC IT WAS WOVEN FRESH FROM THE WARP
8195-117382-0034 NOTES SO THRILLED WITH LOVE'S PLEADING AND PASSION'S TENDER PULSING PAIN THAT AT ITS CLOSE
8195-117382-0035 GATHERED AROUND WITH CARE AND DELIBERATION
8195-117382-0036 IT WAS THE CARDINAL'S DREAM MATERIALIZED FOR ANOTHER BEFORE HIS VERY EYES AND IT FILLED HIM WITH ENVY IF THAT PLAIN BROWN BIRD THAT SLINKED AS IF HE HAD A THEFT TO ACCOUNT FOR COULD BY SHOWING HIMSELF AND SINGING FOR AN HOUR
8195-117382-0037 WIN A MATE WHY SHOULD NOT HE THE MOST GORGEOUS BIRD OF THE WOODS OPENLY FLAUNTING HIS CHARMS AND DISCOURSING HIS MUSIC HAVE AT LEAST EQUAL SUCCESS SHOULD HE THE PROUDEST
8195-117382-0038 MOST MAGNIFICENT OF CARDINALS BE COMPELLED TO GO SEEKING A MATE LIKE ANY COMMON BIRD PERISH THE THOUGHT HE WENT TO THE RIVER TO BATHE AFTER FINDING A SPOT WHERE THE WATER FLOWED CRYSTAL CLEAR OVER A BED OF WHITE LIMESTONE
8195-117382-0039 HE PERCHED AND STRAINED UNTIL HIS JETTY WHISKERS APPEARED STUBBY HE POURED OUT A TUMULTUOUS CRY VIBRANT WITH EVERY PASSION RAGING IN HIM HE CAUGHT UP HIS OWN ROLLING ECHOES
8195-117382-0040 HE IMPROVISED AND SET THE SHINING RIVER RINGING WET YEAR WET YEAR HE WHISTLED AND WHISTLED UNTIL ALL BIRDLAND AND EVEN MANKIND HEARD FOR THE FARMER PAUSED AT HIS KITCHEN DOOR

8195-117382-0094 THE CARDINAL WENT TO THE TOP RAIL AND FEASTED ON THE SWEET GRAINS OF CORN UNTIL HIS CRAW WAS FULL AND THEN NESTLED IN THE SUMAC AND WENT TO SLEEP EARLY NEXT MORNING HE WAS ABROAD AND IN FINE TOILET
8195-117382-0095 AND WITH A FULL VOICE FROM THE TOP OF THE SUMAC GREETED THE DAY WET YEAR WET YEAR FAR DOWN THE RIVER ECHOED HIS VOICE UNTIL IT SO CLOSELY RESEMBLED SOME MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY
8195-117382-0096 AND BUSY WITH THEIR NEST BUILDING THE CARDINAL RETURNED TO THE SUMAC
8195-117382-0097 HE DECIDED TO PROSPECT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND TAKING WING HE STARTED UP THE RIVER FOLLOWING THE CHANNEL HE WINGED HIS FLIGHT FOR MILES OVER THE COOL SPARKLING WATER BETWEEN THE TANGLE OF FOLIAGE BORDERING THE BANKS
8195-117382-0098 WHEN HE CAME TO THE LONG CUMBROUS STRUCTURES OF WOOD WITH WHICH MEN HAD BRIDGED THE RIVER WHERE THE SHUFFLING FEET OF TIRED FARM HORSES RAISED CLOUDS OF DUST AND SET THE ECHOES ROLLING WITH THEIR THUNDEROUS HOOF BEATS
8195-117382-0099 HE WAS AFRAID AND RISING HIGH HE SAILED OVER THEM IN SHORT BROKEN CURVES OF FLIGHT BUT WHERE GIANT MAPLE AND ASH LEANING LOCKED BRANCHES ACROSS THE CHANNEL
8195-117382-0100 GENTLY SLOPING IN OTHERS AND ALWAYS CROWDED WITH A TANGLE OF FOLIAGE AT AN ABRUPT CURVE IN THE RIVER HE MOUNTED TO THE SUMMIT OF A BIG ASH AND MADE BOASTFUL PROPHECY WET YEAR WET YEAR
8195-117382-0101 AND ON ALL SIDES THERE SPRANG UP THE VOICES OF HIS KIND STARTLED THE CARDINAL TOOK WING HE FOLLOWED THE RIVER IN A CIRCLING FLIGHT UNTIL HE REMEMBERED THAT HERE MIGHT BE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WIN THE COVETED RIVER MATE
8195-117382-0102 THE CARDINAL FLEW OVER THE NARROW NECK AND SENT ANOTHER CALL
8195-117382-0103 AGAIN HE FLASHED UP THE RIVER AND CIRCLED HORSESHOE BEND
8195-117382-0104 HE UNDERSTOOD THE RIVER CIRCLED IN ONE GREAT CURVE THE CARDINAL MOUNTED TO THE TIP TOP LIMB OF THE ASH AND LOOKED AROUND HIM THERE WAS NEVER A FAIRER SIGHT FOR THE EYE OF MAN OR BIRD
8195-117382-0105 THE MIST AND SHIMMER OF EARLY SPRING WERE IN THE AIR THE WABASH ROUNDED HORSESHOE BEND
8195-117382-0106 SEEMED TO SWEEP THE FACE OF HEAVEN AND WHOSE ROOTS LIKE MISERLY FINGERS CLUTCHED DEEP INTO THE BLACK MUCK OF RAINBOW BOTTOM IT WAS IN THIS LOVELY SPOT THAT THE RAINBOW AT LAST MATERIALIZED
8195-117382-0107 FOR GOOD MEASURE THERE WERE ADDED SEEDS
8195-117382-0108 ABOVE ALL THE SYCAMORE WAVED ITS MAJESTIC HEAD IT MADE A THRONE THAT SEEMED SUITABLE FOR THE SON OF THE KING AND MOUNTING TO ITS TOPMOST BRANCH FOR MILES THE RIVER CARRIED HIS CHALLENGE
8195-117382-0109 HO CARDINALS LOOK THIS WAY BEHOLD ME HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OTHER OF SO GREAT SIZE HAVE YOU ANY TO EQUAL MY GRACE WHO CAN WHISTLE SO LOUD SO CLEAR SO COMPELLING A NOTE
8195-117382-0110 THAT AMONG THE MANY CARDINALS THAT HAD GATHERED TO HEAR THERE WAS NOT ONE TO COMPARE WITH HIM BLACK ENVY FILLED THEIR HEARTS WHO WAS THIS FLAMING DASHING STRANGER
8195-117382-0111 THERE WERE MANY UNMATED CARDINALS IN RAINBOW BOTTOM AND MANY JEALOUS MALES A SECOND TIME THE CARDINAL ROCKING AND FLASHING PROCLAIMED HIMSELF
8195-117382-0112 HERE HERE
8195-117382-0113 THE CARDINAL WITH A ROYAL FLOURISH SPRANG IN AIR TO SEEK HER BUT HER OUTRAGED MATE WAS AHEAD OF HIM AND WITH A SCREAM SHE FLED LEAVING A TUFT OF FEATHERS IN HER MATE'S BEAK IN TURN
8195-117382-0114 THE CARDINAL STRUCK HIM LIKE A FLASHING ROCKET AND THEN RED WAR WAGED IN RAINBOW BOTTOM THE FEMALES SCATTERED FOR COVER WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT THE CARDINAL WORKED IN A KISS ON ONE POOR LITTLE BIRD TOO FRIGHTENED
8195-117382-0115 TO ESCAPE HIM THEN THE MALES CLOSED IN AND SERIOUS BUSINESS BEGAN THE CARDINAL WOULD HAVE ENJOYED A FIGHT VASTLY WITH TWO OR THREE OPPONENTS BUT A HALF DOZEN MADE DISCRETION
8195-117382-0116 BETTER THAN VALOUR HE DARTED AMONG THEM SCATTERING THEM RIGHT AND LEFT AND MADE FOR THE SYCAMORE WITH ALL HIS REMAINING BREATH HE INSOLENTLY REPEATED HIS CHALLENGE AND THEN
8195-117382-0117 HEADED DOWN STREAM FOR THE SUMAC WITH WHAT GRACE HE COULD COMMAND THERE WAS AN HOUR OF ANGRY RECRIMINATION BEFORE SWEET PEACE BROODED AGAIN IN RAINBOW BOTTOM THE NEWLY MATED PAIR FINALLY MADE UP
8195-117382-0118 AND FORGOT THE CAPTIVATING STRANGER ALL SAVE THE POOR LITTLE ONE THAT HAD BEEN KISSED BY ACCIDENT
8195-117382-0119 SHE HAD BEEN HATCHED FROM A FIFTH EGG TO BEGIN WITH AND EVERY ONE KNOWS THE DISADVANTAGE OF BEGINNING LIFE WITH FOUR STURDY OLDER BIRDS ON TOP OF ONE IT WAS A MEAGER EGG
8195-117382-0120 SHE CRIED PITIFULLY AND WAS ALMOST DEAD WHEN A BROWN FACED BAREFOOT BOY WITH A FISHING POLE ON HIS SHOULDER PASSED AND HEARD HER POOR LITTLE THING YOU ARE ALMOST DEAD HE SAID
8195-117382-0121 I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO WITH YOU I'LL TAKE YOU OVER AND SET YOU IN THE BUSHES
8195-117382-0122 TO SAVE THE POOR QUIVERING LITTLE BIRD SHE WAS LEFT SO BADLY FRIGHTENED THAT SHE COULD NOT MOVE FOR A LONG TIME ALL THE TRIBULATIONS OF BIRDLAND FELL TO HER LOT SHE WAS SO FRAIL AND WEAK
8195-117382-0123 SHE LOST TWO OF HER WING QUILLS AND THAT MADE HER MORE TIMID THAN EVER COMING NORTH SHE HAD GIVEN OUT AGAIN AND FINALLY HAD WANDERED INTO RAINBOW BOTTOM LOST AND ALONE SHE WAS SUCH A SHY FEARSOME LITTLE BODY
8195-117382-0124 THE FEMALES ALL FLOUTED HER AND THE MALES NEVER SEEMED TO NOTICE THAT THERE WAS MATERIAL IN HER FOR A VERY FINE MATE EVERY OTHER FEMALE CARDINAL IN RAINBOW BOTTOM HAD SEVERAL MALES COURTING HER BUT THIS POOR FRIGHTENED
8195-117382-0125 HE HAD INTENDED IT FOR THE BOLD CREATURE THAT HAD ANSWERED HIS CHALLENGE BUT SINCE IT CAME TO HER IT WAS HERS IN A WAY AFTER ALL SHE HID IN THE UNDERBRUSH FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY
8195-117382-0126 AND WAS NEVER SO FRIGHTENED IN ALL HER LIFE
8195-117382-0127 AT THE DOWN CURVE OF THE HORSESHOE STRAINING HER EARS
8195-117382-0128 ALL DAY SHE HID AND WAITED AND THE FOLLOWING DAYS WERE FILLED WITH LONGING BUT HE NEVER CAME AGAIN SO ONE MORNING POSSESSED WITH COURAGE SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
8195-117382-0129 SHE STARTED DOWN THE RIVER FOR MILES SHE SNEAKED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH AND WATCHED AND LISTENED
8195-117382-0130 AND SHE RETURNED TO RAINBOW BOTTOM THE NEXT MORNING SHE SET OUT EARLY AND FLEW TO THE SPOT
8195-117382-0131 THE NIGHT BEFORE FROM THERE SHE GLIDED THROUGH THE BUSHES AND UNDERBRUSH TREMBLING AND QUAKING YET PUSHING STOUTLY ONWARD STRAINING HER EARS FOR SOME NOTE OF THE BRILLIANT STRANGER'S IT WAS MID FORENOON
8195-117382-0132 WHEN SHE REACHED THE REGION OF THE SUMAC AND AS SHE HOPPED WARILY ALONG ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM HER FULL AND SPLENDID THERE BURST THE VOICE OF THE SINGER FOR WHOM SHE WAS SEARCHING
8195-117382-0133 SHE SPRANG INTO AIR AND FLED A MILE BEFORE SHE REALIZED THAT SHE WAS FLYING THEN SHE STOPPED AND LISTENED AND ROLLING WITH THE RIVER SHE HEARD THOSE BOLD TRUE TONES
8195-117382-0134 CLOSE TO EARTH SHE WENT BACK AGAIN TO SEE IF UNOBSERVED SHE COULD FIND A SPOT WHERE SHE MIGHT WATCH THE STRANGER THAT HAD KISSED HER WHEN AT LAST SHE REACHED A PLACE WHERE SHE COULD SEE HIM PLAINLY
8195-117382-0135 HIS BEAUTY WAS SO BEWILDERING
8195-117382-0136 THERE WAS NOTHING SAVE DEFEAT FROM OVERWHELMING NUMBERS IN RAINBOW BOTTOM
