1680-142282-0000 UNPACKING AND ARRANGING BUT EVERYTHING INSIDE THE HOUSE STILL LOOKED IN DISORDER AND OUTSIDE A THICK FOG CREPT UP TO THE VERY WINDOWS AND WAS DRIVEN IN TO EVERY OPEN DOOR IN CHOKING WHITE WREATHS
1680-142282-0001 OF UNWHOLESOME MIST OH MARGARET ARE WE TO LIVE HERE ASKED MISSUS HALE IN BLANK DISMAY MARGARET'S HEART ECHOED THE DREARINESS OF THE TONE IN WHICH THIS QUESTION WAS PUT
1680-142282-0002 OH THE FOGS IN LONDON ARE SOMETIMES FAR WORSE BUT THEN YOU KNEW THAT LONDON ITSELF AND FRIENDS LAY BEHIND IT HERE WELL WE ARE DESOLATE OH DIXON WHAT A PLACE THIS IS
1680-142282-0003 INDEED MA'AM I'M SURE IT WILL BE YOUR DEATH BEFORE LONG AND THEN I KNOW WHO'LL STAY
1680-142282-0004 NOT AT ALL THANK YOU DIXON REPLIED MARGARET COLDLY THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR MAMMA
1680-142282-0005 MISTER HALE WAS EQUALLY OUT OF SPIRITS AND EQUALLY CAME UPON MARGARET FOR SYMPATHY MARGARET
1680-142282-0006 I WISH I HAD GONE INTO SOME COUNTRY PLACE IN WALES THIS IS REALLY TERRIBLE SAID HE GOING UP TO THE WINDOW THERE WAS NO COMFORT TO BE GIVEN THEY WERE SETTLED IN MILTON
1680-142282-0007 AND MUST ENDURE SMOKE AND FOGS FOR A SEASON INDEED ALL OTHER LIFE SEEMED SHUT OUT FROM THEM BY AS THICK A FOG
1680-142282-0008 ONLY THE DAY BEFORE MISTER HALE HAD BEEN RECKONING UP WITH DISMAY HOW MUCH THEIR REMOVAL AND FORTNIGHT AT HESTON HAD COST AND HE FOUND IT HAD ABSORBED NEARLY ALL HIS LITTLE STOCK OF READY MONEY
1680-142282-0009 AND HERE THEY MUST REMAIN
1680-142282-0010 SHE FELT INCLINED TO SIT DOWN IN A STUPOR OF DESPAIR THE HEAVY SMOKY AIR HUNG ABOUT HER BEDROOM
1680-142282-0011 THE WINDOW PLACED AT THE SIDE OF THE OBLONG LOOKED TO THE BLANK WALL OF A SIMILAR PROJECTION NOT ABOVE TEN FEET DISTANT IT LOOMED THROUGH THE FOG LIKE A GREAT BARRIER TO HOPE
1680-142282-0012 INSIDE THE ROOM EVERYTHING WAS IN CONFUSION
1680-142282-0013 MARGARET SAT DOWN ON A BOX THE DIRECTION CARD UPON WHICH STRUCK HER AS HAVING BEEN WRITTEN AT HELSTONE BEAUTIFUL BELOVED HELSTONE SHE LOST HERSELF IN DISMAL THOUGHT
1680-142282-0014 BUT AT LAST SHE DETERMINED TO TAKE HER MIND AWAY FROM THE PRESENT AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD A LETTER FROM EDITH WHICH SHE HAD ONLY HALF READ IN THE BUSTLE OF THE MORNING IT WAS TO TELL OF THEIR ARRIVAL AT CORFU
1680-142282-0015 THE GAY NEW LIFE OPENING UPON HER
1680-142282-0016 AND ITS VIEWS OVER WHITE CLIFFS AND DEEP BLUE SEA EDITH WROTE FLUENTLY AND WELL IF NOT GRAPHICALLY
1680-142282-0017 FOR MARGARET TO MAKE IT OUT FOR HERSELF CAPTAIN LENNOX AND ANOTHER LATELY MARRIED OFFICER SHARED A VILLA
1680-142282-0018 LATE AS IT WAS IN THE YEAR SEEMED SPENT IN BOATING OR LAND PIC NICS ALL OUT OF DOORS PLEASURE SEEKING AND GLAD
1680-142282-0019 FREE UTTERLY FREE FROM FLECK OR CLOUD
1680-142282-0020 AND SHE THE MOST MUSICAL OFFICER'S WIFE THERE HAD TO COPY THE NEW AND POPULAR TUNES
1680-142282-0021 THOSE SEEMED THEIR MOST SEVERE AND ARDUOUS DUTIES SHE EXPRESSED AN AFFECTIONATE HOPE THAT IF THE REGIMENT STOPPED ANOTHER YEAR AT CORFU MARGARET
1680-142282-0022 SHE ASKED MARGARET IF SHE REMEMBERED THE DAY TWELVE MONTH ON WHICH SHE EDITH WROTE HOW IT RAINED ALL DAY LONG IN HARLEY STREET
1680-142282-0023 YES MARGARET REMEMBERED IT WELL
1680-142282-0024 MARGARET HAD JOINED THE PARTY IN THE EVENING
1680-142282-0025 ALL CAME VIVIDLY BEFORE HER IN STRANGE CONTRAST TO THE PRESENT TIME THE SMOOTH SEA OF THAT OLD LIFE CLOSED UP WITHOUT A MARK LEFT TO TELL WHERE THEY HAD ALL BEEN
1680-142282-0026 THE DANCING EVENINGS WERE ALL GOING ON GOING ON FOR EVER THOUGH HER AUNT SHAW AND EDITH WERE NO LONGER THERE
1680-142282-0027 SHE DOUBTED IF ANY ONE OF THAT OLD SET EVER THOUGHT OF HER EXCEPT HENRY LENNOX
1680-142282-0028 SHE HAD HEARD HIM OFTEN BOAST OF HIS POWER OF PUTTING ANY DISAGREEABLE THOUGHT FAR AWAY FROM HIM THEN SHE PENETRATED FARTHER INTO WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF SHE HAD CARED FOR HIM AS A LOVER AND HAD ACCEPTED HIM
1680-142282-0029 AND THIS CHANGE IN HER FATHER'S OPINIONS
1680-142282-0030 SHE COULD NOT DOUBT BUT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPATIENTLY RECEIVED BY MISTER LENNOX IT WAS A BITTER MORTIFICATION TO HER IN ONE SENSE BUT SHE COULD BEAR IT PATIENTLY
1680-142282-0031 BECAUSE SHE KNEW HER FATHER'S PURITY OF PURPOSE AND THAT STRENGTHENED HER TO ENDURE HIS ERRORS GRAVE AND SERIOUS THOUGH IN HER ESTIMATION THEY WERE BUT THE FACT OF THE
1680-142282-0032 IN ITS ROUGH WHOLESALE JUDGMENT WOULD HAVE OPPRESSED AND IRRITATED MISTER LENNOX AS SHE REALISED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHE GREW TO BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT WAS THEY WERE AT THE LOWEST NOW THEY COULD NOT BE WORSE
1680-142282-0033 EDITH'S ASTONISHMENT AND HER AUNT SHAW'S DISMAY WOULD HAVE TO BE MET BRAVELY WHEN THEIR LETTERS CAME SO MARGARET ROSE UP AND BEGAN SLOWLY TO UNDRESS HERSELF
1680-142282-0034 LATE AS IT WAS AFTER ALL THE PAST HURRY OF THE DAY
1680-142282-0035 BUT IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW LONG IT WOULD BE BEFORE THE BRIGHTNESS CAME HER HEART WOULD HAVE SUNK LOW DOWN THE TIME OF THE YEAR WAS MOST UNPROPITIOUS TO HEALTH AS WELL AS TO SPIRITS
1680-142282-0036 HER MOTHER CAUGHT A SEVERE COLD AND DIXON HERSELF WAS EVIDENTLY NOT WELL ALTHOUGH MARGARET COULD NOT INSULT HER MORE THAN BY TRYING TO SAVE HER OR BY TAKING ANY CARE OF HER
1680-142282-0037 THEY COULD HEAR OF NO GIRL TO ASSIST HER ALL WERE AT WORK IN THE FACTORIES AT LEAST THOSE WHO APPLIED WERE WELL SCOLDED BY DIXON FOR THINKING THAT SUCH AS THEY COULD EVER BE TRUSTED TO WORK IN A GENTLEMAN'S HOUSE
1680-142282-0038 SO THEY HAD TO KEEP A CHARWOMAN IN ALMOST CONSTANT EMPLOY MARGARET LONGED TO SEND FOR CHARLOTTE
1680-142282-0039 THE DISTANCE WAS TOO GREAT MISTER HALE MET WITH SEVERAL PUPILS RECOMMENDED TO HIM BY MISTER BELL OR BY THE MORE
1680-142282-0040 THEY WERE MOSTLY OF THE AGE WHEN MANY BOYS WOULD BE STILL AT SCHOOL BUT ACCORDING TO THE PREVALENT AND APPARENTLY WELL FOUNDED NOTIONS OF MILTON TO MAKE A LAD INTO A GOOD TRADESMAN HE MUST BE CAUGHT YOUNG
1680-142282-0041 IF HE WERE SENT TO EVEN THE SCOTCH UNIVERSITIES HE CAME BACK UNSETTLED FOR COMMERCIAL PURSUITS HOW MUCH MORE SO IF HE WENT TO OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE WHERE HE COULD NOT BE ENTERED TILL HE WAS EIGHTEEN
1680-142282-0042 SO MOST OF THE MANUFACTURERS PLACED THEIR SONS IN SUCKING SITUATIONS AT FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE
1680-142282-0043 IN HOPES OF THROWING THE WHOLE STRENGTH AND VIGOUR OF THE PLANT INTO COMMERCE STILL THERE WERE SOME WISER PARENTS AND SOME YOUNG MEN WHO HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES
1680-142282-0044 AND STRIVE TO REMEDY THEM NAY THERE WERE A FEW NO LONGER YOUTHS BUT MEN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE WHO HAD THE STERN WISDOM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR OWN IGNORANCE
1680-142282-0045 MISTER THORNTON WAS PERHAPS THE OLDEST OF MISTER HALE'S PUPILS
1680-142282-0046 THAT IT BECAME A LITTLE DOMESTIC JOKE TO WONDER WHAT TIME
1680-142282-0047 MARGARET RATHER
1680-142282-0048 BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT HER MOTHER WAS INCLINED TO LOOK UPON THIS NEW FRIENDSHIP OF HER HUSBAND'S WITH JEALOUS EYES AS LONG AS HIS TIME HAD BEEN SOLELY OCCUPIED WITH HIS BOOKS AND HIS PARISHIONERS
1680-142282-0049 AS AT HELSTONE SHE HAD APPEARED TO CARE LITTLE WHETHER SHE SAW MUCH OF HIM OR NOT BUT NOW THAT HE LOOKED EAGERLY FORWARD TO EACH RENEWAL OF HIS INTERCOURSE WITH MISTER THORNTON SHE SEEMED HURT AND ANNOYED
1680-142282-0050 AS IF HE WERE SLIGHTING HER COMPANIONSHIP FOR THE FIRST TIME MISTER HALE'S OVER PRAISE HAD THE USUAL EFFECT OF OVER PRAISE UPON HIS AUDITORS THEY WERE A LITTLE INCLINED TO REBEL AGAINST
1680-142282-0051 ALWAYS CALLED THE JUST AFTER A QUIET LIFE IN A COUNTRY PARSONAGE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS THERE WAS SOMETHING DAZZLING TO MISTER HALE IN THE ENERGY WHICH CONQUERED IMMENSE DIFFICULTIES WITH EASE
1680-142282-0052 IMPRESSED HIM WITH A SENSE OF GRANDEUR
1680-142282-0053 OF ITS EXERCISE BUT MARGARET WENT LESS ABROAD AMONG MACHINERY AND MEN SAW LESS OF POWER IN ITS PUBLIC EFFECT
1680-142282-0054 SHE WAS THROWN WITH ONE OR TWO OF THOSE WHO IN ALL MEASURES AFFECTING MASSES OF PEOPLE MUST BE ACUTE SUFFERERS FOR THE GOOD OF MANY THE QUESTION ALWAYS IS
1680-142282-0055 HAS EVERYTHING BEEN DONE TO MAKE THE SUFFERINGS OF THESE EXCEPTIONS AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE OR IN THE TRIUMPH OF THE CROWDED PROCESSION HAVE THE HELPLESS BEEN TRAMPLED ON
1680-142282-0056 ON HIS MARCH IT FELL TO MARGARET'S SHARE TO HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR A SERVANT TO ASSIST DIXON
1680-142282-0057 WHO HAD AT FIRST UNDERTAKEN TO FIND JUST THE PERSON SHE WANTED TO DO ALL THE ROUGH WORK OF THE HOUSE BUT DIXON'S IDEAS OF HELPFUL GIRLS WERE FOUNDED ON THE RECOLLECTION OF TIDY ELDER SCHOLARS AT HELSTONE SCHOOL
1680-142282-0058 WHO WERE ONLY TOO PROUD TO BE ALLOWED TO COME TO THE PARSONAGE ON A BUSY DAY
1680-142282-0059 DIXON WAS NOT UNCONSCIOUS OF THIS AWED REVERENCE WHICH WAS GIVEN TO HER
1680-142282-0060 THE FOURTEENTH WAS FLATTERED BY HIS COURTIERS
1680-142282-0061 COULD HAVE MADE HER ENDURE THE ROUGH INDEPENDENT WAY IN WHICH ALL THE MILTON GIRLS
1680-142282-0062 HAVING DOUBTS AND FEARS OF THEIR OWN AS TO THE SOLVENCY OF A FAMILY WHO LIVED IN A HOUSE OF THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
1680-142282-0063 AND KEPT TWO SERVANTS ONE OF THEM SO VERY HIGH AND MIGHTY
1680-142282-0064 MARGARET WAS WEARY AND IMPATIENT OF THE ACCOUNTS WHICH DIXON PERPETUALLY BROUGHT
1680-142282-0065 WOULD BE SERVANTS NOT BUT WHAT MARGARET WAS REPELLED BY THE ROUGH UNCOURTEOUS MANNERS OF THESE PEOPLE NOT BUT WHAT SHE SHRUNK WITH FASTIDIOUS PRIDE FROM THEIR HAIL FELLOW ACCOST
1680-142282-0066 AND SEVERELY RESENTED THEIR UNCONCEALED CURIOSITY AS TO THE MEANS AND POSITION OF ANY FAMILY WHO LIVED IN MILTON
1680-142282-0067 THE MORE LIKELY SHE WAS TO BE SILENT ON THE SUBJECT AND AT ANY RATE IF SHE TOOK UPON HERSELF TO MAKE INQUIRY FOR A SERVANT SHE COULD SPARE HER MOTHER THE RECITAL
1680-142282-0068 WHO DID NOT PREFER THE BETTER WAGES AND GREATER INDEPENDENCE OF WORKING IN A MILL IT WAS SOMETHING OF A TRIAL TO MARGARET
1680-142282-0069 OF PROPRIETY AND HER OWN HELPLESS DEPENDENCE ON OTHERS HAD ALWAYS MADE HER INSIST THAT A FOOTMAN SHOULD ACCOMPANY EDITH AND MARGARET IF THEY WENT BEYOND HARLEY STREET OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
1680-142282-0070 THE LIMITS BY WHICH THIS RULE OF HER AUNT'S HAD CIRCUMSCRIBED MARGARET'S INDEPENDENCE HAD BEEN SILENTLY REBELLED AGAINST AT THE TIME AND SHE HAD DOUBLY ENJOYED THE FREE WALKS AND RAMBLES OF HER FOREST LIFE
1680-142282-0071 FROM THE CONTRAST WHICH THEY PRESENTED SHE WENT ALONG THERE WITH A
1680-142282-0072 IF SHE WERE IN A HURRY AND OCCASIONALLY WAS STILLED INTO PERFECT REPOSE AS SHE STOOD LISTENING TO
1680-142282-0073 FROM THE LOW BRUSHWOOD OR TANGLED FURZE IT WAS A TRIAL TO COME DOWN FROM SUCH MOTION OR SUCH STILLNESS
1680-142282-0074 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY WHAT WAS A MORE SERIOUS ANNOYANCE THE SIDE OF THE TOWN ON WHICH CRAMPTON LAY WAS ESPECIALLY A THOROUGHFARE FOR THE FACTORY PEOPLE
1680-142282-0075 IN THE BACK STREETS AROUND THEM THERE WERE MANY MILLS OUT OF WHICH POURED STREAMS OF MEN AND WOMEN TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY UNTIL MARGARET HAD LEARNT THE TIMES OF THEIR INGRESS AND EGRESS
1680-142282-0076 SHE WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE IN CONSTANTLY FALLING IN WITH THEM THEY CAME RUSHING ALONG WITH BOLD FEARLESS FACES AND LOUD LAUGHS AND JESTS
1680-142282-0077 THE TONES OF THEIR UNRESTRAINED VOICES AND THEIR CARELESSNESS
1680-142282-0078 WOULD COMMENT ON HER DRESS EVEN TOUCH HER SHAWL OR GOWN TO
1680-142282-0079 NAY ONCE OR TWICE SHE WAS ASKED QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO SOME ARTICLE WHICH THEY PARTICULARLY ADMIRED THERE WAS SUCH A SIMPLE RELIANCE ON HER WOMANLY SYMPATHY WITH THEIR LOVE OF DRESS AND ON HER
1680-142282-0080 AND HALF SMILED BACK AT THEIR REMARKS SHE DID NOT MIND MEETING ANY NUMBER OF GIRLS LOUD SPOKEN AND BOISTEROUS THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE BUT SHE ALTERNATELY DREADED AND FIRED UP AGAINST THE WORKMEN
1680-142282-0081 WHO COMMENTED NOT ON HER DRESS BUT ON HER LOOKS IN THE SAME OPEN FEARLESS MANNER SHE WHO HAD HITHERTO FELT THAT EVEN THE MOST REFINED REMARK ON HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE WAS AN IMPERTINENCE
1680-142282-0082 FROM THESE OUTSPOKEN MEN
1680-142282-0083 AS SHE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED IF SHE HAD BEEN LESS FRIGHTENED BY THE DISORDERLY TUMULT OUT OF HER FRIGHT CAME A FLASH OF INDIGNATION WHICH MADE HER FACE SCARLET AND HER DARK EYES
1680-142282-0084 WHEN SHE REACHED THE QUIET SAFETY OF HOME AMUSED HER EVEN WHILE THEY IRRITATED HER FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY AFTER SHE HAD PASSED A NUMBER OF MEN
1680-142282-0085 ONE OF THE LINGERERS ADDED YOUR BONNY FACE MY LASS MAKES THE DAY LOOK BRIGHTER AND ANOTHER DAY AS SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY SMILING AT SOME PASSING THOUGHT SHE WAS ADDRESSED BY A POORLY DRESSED MIDDLE AGED WORKMAN WITH
1680-142282-0086 YOU MAY WELL SMILE MY LASS MANY A ONE WOULD SMILE TO HAVE SUCH A BONNY FACE THIS MAN LOOKED SO CAREWORN THAT MARGARET COULD NOT HELP GIVING HIM AN ANSWERING SMILE
1680-142282-0087 GLAD TO THINK THAT HER LOOKS SUCH AS THEY WERE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE POWER TO CALL UP A PLEASANT THOUGHT HE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HER ACKNOWLEDGING GLANCE AND A SILENT RECOGNITION WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM
1680-142282-0088 BUT THAT FIRST COMPLIMENT YET SOMEHOW
1680-142282-0089 ONCE OR TWICE ON SUNDAYS SHE SAW HIM WALKING WITH A GIRL EVIDENTLY HIS DAUGHTER AND IF POSSIBLE STILL MORE UNHEALTHY THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ONE DAY MARGARET AND HER FATHER HAD BEEN AS FAR
1680-142282-0090 AND SHE HAD GATHERED SOME OF THE HEDGE AND DITCH FLOWERS DOG VIOLETS
1680-142282-0091 LIKE WITH AN UNSPOKEN LAMENT IN HER HEART FOR THE SWEET PROFUSION OF THE SOUTH HER FATHER HAD LEFT HER TO GO INTO MILTON UPON SOME BUSINESS
1680-142282-0092 THE GIRL LOOKED WISTFULLY AT THE FLOWERS AND ACTING ON A SUDDEN IMPULSE MARGARET OFFERED THEM TO HER HER PALE BLUE EYES LIGHTENED UP AS SHE TOOK THEM AND HER FATHER SPOKE FOR HER THANK YO MISS BESSY'LL
1680-142282-0093 AND I SHALL THINK A DEAL O YOR KINDNESS YO'RE NOT OF THIS COUNTRY I RECKON NO SAID MARGARET HALF SIGHING I COME FROM THE SOUTH FROM HAMPSHIRE SHE CONTINUED A LITTLE AFRAID OF WOUNDING HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
1680-142282-0094 OF IGNORANCE IF SHE USED A NAME WHICH HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
1680-142282-0095 AND YET YO SEE NORTH AND SOUTH HAS BOTH MET AND MADE KIND O FRIENDS IN THIS BIG SMOKY PLACE MARGARET HAD SLACKENED HER PACE TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE MAN AND HIS DAUGHTER
1680-142282-0096 WHOSE STEPS WERE REGULATED BY THE FEEBLENESS OF THE LATTER SHE NOW SPOKE TO THE GIRL AND THERE WAS A SOUND OF TENDER PITY IN THE TONE OF HER VOICE AS SHE DID SO THAT WENT RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE FATHER
1680-142282-0097 NO SAID THE GIRL NOR NEVER WILL BE SPRING IS COMING SAID MARGARET AS IF TO SUGGEST PLEASANT HOPEFUL THOUGHTS SPRING NOR SUMMER WILL DO ME GOOD SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY
1680-142282-0098 MARGARET LOOKED UP AT THE MAN ALMOST EXPECTING SOME CONTRADICTION FROM HIM OR AT LEAST SOME REMARK
1680-142282-0099 I'M AFEARED HOO SPEAKS TRUTH I'M AFEARED HOO'S TOO FAR GONE IN A WASTE

1680-142282-0103 AFTER THE INQUIRIES SHE HAD MADE THAT SHE INTENDED TO COME AND CALL UPON ANY POOR NEIGHBOUR WHOSE NAME AND HABITATION
1680-142282-0104 SHE READ THIS MEANING TOO IN THE MAN'S EYES I'M NONE SO FOND OF HAVING STRANGE FOLK IN MY HOUSE BUT THEN RELENTING AS HE SAW HER HEIGHTENED COLOUR HE ADDED YO'RE A FOREIGNER AS ONE MAY SAY
