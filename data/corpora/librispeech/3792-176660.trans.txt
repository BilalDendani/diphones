3792-176660-0000 HALE OPENED HIS EYES NEXT MORNING ON THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN IN BLACK MOVING GHOST LIKE THROUGH THE DIM INTERIOR TO THE KITCHEN A WOOD THRUSH WAS SINGING WHEN HE STEPPED OUT ON THE PORCH AND ITS COOL NOTES HAD THE LIQUID FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING
3792-176660-0001 BREAKFAST OVER HE CONCLUDED TO LEAVE THE YELLOW MULE WITH THE RED FOX TO BE TAKEN BACK TO THE COUNTY TOWN AND TO WALK DOWN THE MOUNTAIN BUT BEFORE HE GOT AWAY THE LANDLORD'S SON TURNED UP WITH HIS OWN HORSE STILL LAME
3792-176660-0002 BUT WELL ENOUGH TO LIMP ALONG WITHOUT DOING HIMSELF HARM SO LEADING THE BLACK HORSE HALE STARTED DOWN THE SUN WAS RISING OVER STILL SEAS OF WHITE MIST AND WAVE AFTER WAVE OF BLUE VIRGINIA HILLS

3792-176660-0004 AND DOWN HALE WENT UNDER A TREMBLING DEW DRENCHED WORLD AND ALONG A TUMBLING SERIES OF WATER FALLS THAT FLASHED THROUGH TALL FERNS BLOSSOMING LAUREL AND SHINING LEAVES OF RHODODENDRON ONCE

3792-176660-0073 BUT AT NO TIME WOULD SHE LOOK AT HALE OR SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN FOR A WHILE THE TWO MEN SAT ON THE PORCH TALKING OF THE FEUD AND THE GAP AND THE COAL ON THE OLD MAN'S PLACE

3792-176660-0081 HE RODE DOWN FROM THE LUMINOUS UPPER WORLD OF THE MOON AND STARS TOWARD THE NETHER WORLD OF DRIFTING MISTS AND BLACK RAVINES
3792-176660-0082 THAT LITTLE GIRL SHE WAS A PART OF ITS MISTS ITS LIGHTS AND SHADOWS ITS FRESH WILD BEAUTY AND ITS MYSTERY ONLY ONCE DID HIS MIND SHIFT FROM HER TO HIS GREAT PURPOSE
3792-176660-0083 AND THAT WAS WHEN THE ROAR OF THE WATER THROUGH THE ROCKY CHASM OF THE GAP MADE HIM THINK OF THE ROAR OF IRON WHEELS THAT RUSHING THROUGH SOME DAY WOULD DROWN IT INTO SILENCE
3792-176660-0084 AT THE MOUTH OF THE GAP HE SAW THE WHITE VALLEY LYING AT PEACE IN THE MOONLIGHT AND STRAIGHTWAY FROM IT SPRANG AGAIN AS ALWAYS HIS CASTLE IN THE AIR
3792-176660-0085 BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP IN HIS COTTAGE ON THE EDGE OF THE MILLPOND THAT NIGHT
