2674-155968-0000 WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR THE CONSCIENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS IN NO WAY OR SHAPE AROUSED
2674-155968-0001 THE PEOPLE ACCEPTED AND PRACTICED IN A MATTER OF COURSE WAY AS QUITE PROPER
2674-155968-0002 AND THE HIGH PURPOSE SANELY TO ACHIEVE WHAT WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET THESE NEEDS I KNEW BOTH THE MACHINE AND THE SILK STOCKING REFORMERS FAIRLY WELL FROM MANY YEARS CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH THEM THE MACHINE AS SUCH HAD NO IDEALS AT ALL
2674-155968-0003 ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE MEN COMPOSING IT DID HAVE ON THE OTHER HAND THE IDEALS OF VERY MANY OF THE SILK STOCKING REFORMERS
2674-155968-0004 AND SINGULARLY ENOUGH IN INTERNATIONAL MATTERS THESE SAME SILK STOCKINGS WERE NO MORE TO BE TRUSTED THAN THE AVERAGE IGNORANT DEMAGOGUE OR SHORTSIGHTED SPOILS POLITICIANS I FELT THAT THESE MEN WOULD BE BROKEN REEDS TO WHICH TO TRUST
2674-155968-0005 IN ANY VITAL CONTEST FOR BETTERMENT OF SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS I HAD NEITHER THE TRAINING NOR THE CAPACITY THAT WOULD HAVE ENABLED ME TO MATCH MISTER PLATT AND HIS MACHINE PEOPLE ON THEIR OWN GROUND NOR DID I BELIEVE THAT THE EFFORT TO BUILD UP A MACHINE OF MY OWN
2674-155968-0006 UNDER THE THEN EXISTING CONDITIONS WOULD MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SITUATION SO FAR AS THE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED I THEREFORE MADE NO EFFORT TO CREATE A MACHINE OF MY OWN AND CONSISTENTLY ADOPTED THE PLAN OF GOING OVER THE HEADS OF THE MEN HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE AND OF THE MEN IN CONTROL OF THE ORGANIZATION
2674-155968-0007 AND APPEALING DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE BEHIND THEM THE MACHINE FOR INSTANCE HAD A MORE OR LESS STRONG CONTROL OVER THE GREAT BULK OF THE MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT IN THE LAST RESORT THE PEOPLE BEHIND THESE LEGISLATORS HAD A STILL GREATER CONTROL OVER THEM
2674-155968-0008 I MADE UP MY MIND THAT THE ONLY WAY I COULD BEAT THE BOSSES WHENEVER THE NEED TO DO SO AROSE AND UNLESS THERE WAS SUCH NEED I DID NOT WISH TO TRY WAS NOT BY ATTEMPTING TO MANIPULATE THE MACHINERY AND NOT BY TRUSTING MERELY TO THE PROFESSIONAL REFORMERS
2674-155968-0009 BUT BY MAKING MY APPEAL AS DIRECTLY AND AS EMPHATICALLY AS I KNEW HOW TO THE MASS OF VOTERS THEMSELVES TO THE PEOPLE TO THE MEN WHO IF WAKED UP WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL ON THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
2674-155968-0010 MY SUCCESS DEPENDED UPON GETTING THE PEOPLE IN THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS TO LOOK AT MATTERS IN MY WAY AND GETTING THEM TO TAKE SUCH AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN AFFAIRS AS TO ENABLE THEM TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
2674-155968-0011 THERE WERE A FEW OF THE SENATORS AND ASSEMBLYMEN WHOM I COULD REACH BY SEEING THEM PERSONALLY AND PUTTING BEFORE THEM MY ARGUMENTS BUT MOST OF THEM WERE TOO MUCH UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE MACHINE FOR ME TO SHAKE THEM LOOSE UNLESS THEY KNEW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ACTIVELY BEHIND ME
2674-155968-0012 IN MAKING MY APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE I WAS DEALING WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCY FROM THAT WHICH ESPECIALLY IN THE BIG CITIES LIKED TO THINK OF ITSELF AS THE BETTER ELEMENT THE PARTICULAR EXPONENT OF REFORM AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP
2674-155968-0013 I WAS DEALING WITH SHREWD HARD HEADED KINDLY MEN AND WOMEN CHIEFLY CONCERNED WITH THE ABSORBING WORK OF EARNING THEIR OWN LIVING AND IMPATIENT OF FADS WHO HAD GROWN TO FEEL THAT THE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE WORD REFORMER WERE NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE WORD POLITICIAN
2674-155968-0014 I HAD TO CONVINCE THESE MEN AND WOMEN OF MY GOOD FAITH AND MOREOVER OF MY COMMON SENSE AND EFFICIENCY THEY WERE MOST OF THEM STRONG PARTISANS AND AN OUTRAGE HAD TO BE VERY REAL AND VERY GREAT TO SHAKE THEM EVEN PARTIALLY LOOSE FROM THEIR PARTY AFFILIATIONS MOREOVER
2674-155968-0015 THEY TOOK LITTLE INTEREST IN ANY FIGHT OF MERE PERSONALITIES THEY WERE NOT INFLUENCED IN THE LEAST BY THE SILK STOCKING REFORM VIEW OF MISTER PLATT I KNEW THAT IF THEY WERE PERSUADED THAT I WAS ENGAGED IN A MERE FACTION FIGHT AGAINST HIM THAT IT WAS A MERE ISSUE BETWEEN HIS AMBITION AND MINE
2674-155968-0016 THEY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME INDIFFERENT AND MY FIGHT WOULD BE LOST BUT I FELT THAT I COULD COUNT ON THEIR SUPPORT WHEREVER I COULD SHOW THEM THAT THE FIGHT WAS NOT MADE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF THE ROW THAT IT WAS NOT MADE MERELY AS A FACTIONAL CONTEST AGAINST SENATOR PLATT AND THE ORGANIZATION
2674-155968-0017 BUT WAS WAGED FROM A SENSE OF DUTY FOR REAL AND TANGIBLE CAUSES SUCH AS THE PROMOTION OF GOVERNMENTAL EFFICIENCY AND HONESTY AND FORCING POWERFUL MONEYED MEN TO TAKE THE PROPER ATTITUDE TOWARD THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE
2674-155968-0018 THEY STOOD BY ME WHEN I INSISTED UPON HAVING THE CANAL DEPARTMENT THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT AND THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT RUN WITH EFFICIENCY AND HONESTY THEY STOOD BY ME WHEN I INSISTED UPON MAKING WEALTHY MEN WHO OWNED FRANCHISES
2674-155968-0019 PAY THE STATE WHAT THEY PROPERLY OUGHT TO PAY THEY STOOD BY ME WHEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE STRIKES ON THE CROTON AQUEDUCT AND IN BUFFALO I PROMPTLY USED THE MILITARY POWER OF THE STATE TO PUT A STOP TO RIOTING AND VIOLENCE IN THE LATTER CASE
2674-155968-0020 MY CHIEF OPPONENTS AND CRITICS WERE LOCAL POLITICIANS WHO WERE TRUCKLING TO THE LABOR VOTE BUT IN ALL CASES COMING UNDER THE FIRST TWO CATEGORIES I HAD SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH THE STATE LEADERS OF THE MACHINE I ALWAYS DID MY BEST IN GOOD FAITH
2674-155968-0021 TO GET MISTER PLATT AND THE OTHER HEADS OF THE MACHINE TO ACCEPT MY VIEWS AND TO CONVINCE THEM BY REPEATED PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS THAT I WAS RIGHT I NEVER WANTONLY ANTAGONIZED OR HUMILIATED THEM I DID NOT WISH TO HUMILIATE THEM OR TO SEEM VICTORIOUS OVER THEM
2674-155968-0022 WHAT I WISHED WAS TO SECURE THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT IT ESSENTIAL TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE STATE TO SECURE IF I COULD FINALLY PERSUADE THEM TO SUPPORT ME WELL AND GOOD IN SUCH CASE I CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THEM IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER IF AFTER
2674-155968-0023 REPEATED AND PERSISTENT EFFORT I FAILED TO GET THEM TO SUPPORT ME THEN I MADE A FAIR FIGHT IN THE OPEN AND IN A MAJORITY OF CASES I CARRIED MY POINT AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THROUGH THE LEGISLATION WHICH I WISHED IN THEORY THE EXECUTIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LEGISLATION
2674-155968-0024 IN PRACTICE AS THINGS NOW ARE THE EXECUTIVE IS OR OUGHT TO BE PECULIARLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE AS OFTEN AS NOT THE ACTION OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFERS THE ONLY MEANS BY WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN GET THE LEGISLATION THEY DEMAND AND OUGHT TO HAVE
2674-155968-0025 THEREFORE A GOOD EXECUTIVE UNDER THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF AMERICAN POLITICAL LIFE MUST TAKE A VERY ACTIVE INTEREST IN GETTING THE RIGHT KIND OF LEGISLATION IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING HIS EXECUTIVE DUTIES WITH AN EYE SINGLE TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE
2674-155968-0026 MORE THAN HALF OF MY WORK AS GOVERNOR WAS IN THE DIRECTION OF GETTING NEEDED AND IMPORTANT LEGISLATION I ACCOMPLISHED THIS ONLY BY AROUSING THE PEOPLE AND RIVETING THEIR ATTENTION ON WHAT WAS DONE GRADUALLY
2674-155968-0027 TO THE FACT THAT THE MACHINE POLITICIANS WERE NOT GIVING THEM THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY WISHED AS THIS WAKING UP GREW MORE GENERAL NOT MERELY IN NEW YORK OR ANY OTHER ONE STATE BUT THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE NATION THE POWER OF THE BOSSES WANED
2674-155968-0028 THEN A CURIOUS THING HAPPENED THE PROFESSIONAL REFORMERS WHO HAD MOST LOUDLY CRITICIZED THESE BOSSES BEGAN TO CHANGE TOWARD THEM NEWSPAPER EDITORS COLLEGE PRESIDENTS CORPORATION LAWYERS AND BIG BUSINESS MEN ALL ALIKE
2674-155968-0029 HAD DENOUNCED THE BOSSES AND HAD TAKEN PART IN REFORM MOVEMENTS AGAINST THEM SO LONG AS THESE REFORMS DEALT ONLY WITH THINGS THAT WERE SUPERFICIAL OR WITH FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT DID NOT AFFECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR ASSOCIATES
2674-155968-0030 BUT THE MAJORITY OF THESE MEN TURNED TO THE SUPPORT OF THE BOSSES WHEN THE GREAT NEW MOVEMENT BEGAN CLEARLY TO MAKE ITSELF EVIDENT AS ONE AGAINST PRIVILEGE IN BUSINESS NO LESS THAN AGAINST PRIVILEGE IN POLITICS
2674-155968-0031 AS ONE FOR SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL NO LESS THAN FOR POLITICAL RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FAIR DEALING THE BIG CORPORATION LAWYER WHO HAD ANTAGONIZED THE BOSS IN MATTERS WHICH HE REGARDED AS PURELY POLITICAL STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE BOSS WHEN THE MOVEMENT FOR BETTERMENT
2674-155968-0032 TOOK SHAPE IN DIRECT ATTACK ON THE COMBINATION OF BUSINESS WITH POLITICS AND WITH THE JUDICIARY WHICH HAS DONE SO MUCH TO ENTHRONE PRIVILEGE IN THE ECONOMIC WORLD THE REFORMERS WHO DENOUNCED POLITICAL CORRUPTION AND FRAUD
2674-155968-0033 WHEN SHOWN AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR OWN CANDIDATES BY MACHINE WARD HEELERS OF A LOW TYPE HYSTERICALLY APPLAUDED SIMILAR CORRUPT TRICKERY WHEN PRACTICED BY THESE SAME POLITICIANS AGAINST MEN WITH WHOSE POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROGRAMME THE REFORMERS WERE NOT IN SYMPATHY
2674-155968-0034 I HAD ALWAYS BEEN INSTINCTIVELY AND BY NATURE A DEMOCRAT BUT IF I HAD NEEDED CONVERSION TO THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL HERE IN AMERICA
2674-155968-0035 BUT OF THE BULK OF THE MEN WHO MOST PRIDED THEMSELVES UPON THEIR EDUCATION AND CULTURE WHEN WE BEGAN IN GOOD FAITH TO GRAPPLE WITH THE WRONG AND INJUSTICE OF OUR SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM AND TO HIT AT THE MEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WRONG
2674-155968-0036 NO MATTER HOW HIGH THEY STOOD IN BUSINESS OR IN POLITICS AT THE BAR OR ON THE BENCH IT WAS WHILE I WAS GOVERNOR AND ESPECIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX LEGISLATION THAT I FIRST BECAME THOROUGHLY AWARE OF THE REAL CAUSES OF THIS ATTITUDE
2674-155968-0037 AMONG THE MEN OF GREAT WEALTH AND AMONG THE MEN WHO TOOK THEIR TONE FROM THE MEN OF GREAT WEALTH VERY SOON AFTER MY VICTORY IN THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR I HAD ONE OR TWO EXPERIENCES WITH SENATOR PLATT WHICH SHOWED IN AMUSING FASHION
2674-155968-0038 HOW ABSOLUTE THE RULE OF THE BOSS WAS IN THE POLITICS OF THAT DAY SENATOR PLATT WHO WAS ALWAYS MOST KIND AND FRIENDLY IN HIS PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH ME ASKED ME IN ONE DAY TO TALK OVER WHAT WAS TO BE DONE AT ALBANY HE HAD THE TWO OR THREE NOMINAL HEADS OF THE ORGANIZATION WITH HIM
2674-155968-0039 THEY WERE HIS LIEUTENANTS WHO COUNSELED AND INFLUENCED HIM WHOSE ADVICE HE OFTEN FOLLOWED BUT WHO WHEN HE HAD FINALLY MADE UP HIS MIND MERELY REGISTERED AND CARRIED OUT HIS DECREES AFTER A LITTLE CONVERSATION THE SENATOR ASKED IF I HAD ANY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY
2674-155968-0040 WHOM I WISHED TO HAVE PUT ON ANY COMMITTEE EXPLAINING THAT THE COMMITTEES WERE BEING ARRANGED I ANSWERED NO
2674-155968-0041 BECAUSE I HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD THE SPEAKER WHO APPOINTED THE COMMITTEES HAD HIMSELF BEEN AGREED UPON BY THE MEMBERS ELECT OH RESPONDED THE SENATOR WITH A TOLERANT SMILE HE HAS NOT BEEN CHOSEN YET BUT OF COURSE WHOEVER WE CHOOSE AS SPEAKER WILL AGREE BEFOREHAND TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENTS WE WISH
2674-155968-0042 I MADE A MENTAL NOTE TO THE EFFECT THAT IF THEY ATTEMPTED THE SAME PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNOR ELECT THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES MISTAKEN IN A FEW DAYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THIS ARRIVED
2674-155968-0043 THE TRANS STATE CANAL AND THESE SCANDALS HAD BEEN ONE OF THE CHIEF ISSUES IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS WORK WAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC WORKS IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS HIS OFFICE WAS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE UNDER ME
2674-155968-0044 AND I INTENDED TO APPOINT TO IT SOME MAN OF HIGH CHARACTER AND CAPACITY
2674-155968-0045 BUT WITHOUT REGARD TO POLITICS A WEEK OR SO AFTER THE SPEAKERSHIP INCIDENT SENATOR PLATT ASKED ME TO COME AND SEE HIM HE WAS AN OLD AND PHYSICALLY FEEBLE MAN ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT ONLY WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY ON ARRIVAL
2674-155968-0046 I FOUND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ELECT MISTER WOODRUFF WHO HAD ALSO BEEN ASKED TO COME THE SENATOR INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS GLAD TO SAY THAT I WOULD HAVE A MOST ADMIRABLE MAN AS SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AS HE HAD JUST RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN WHOM HE NAMED
2674-155968-0047 SAYING THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT THE POSITION HE HANDED ME THE TELEGRAM THE MAN IN QUESTION WAS A MAN I LIKED
2674-155968-0048 BUT HE CAME FROM A CITY ALONG THE LINE OF THE CANAL
2674-155968-0049 AND MOREOVER WHAT WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT UNDERSTOOD AT THE VERY OUTSET THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS MY ADMINISTRATION AND WAS NO ONE ELSE'S BUT MINE SO I TOLD THE SENATOR VERY POLITELY THAT I WAS SORRY BUT THAT I COULD NOT APPOINT HIS MAN
2674-155968-0050 THIS PRODUCED AN EXPLOSION BUT I DECLINED TO LOSE MY TEMPER MERELY REPEATING THAT I MUST DECLINE TO ACCEPT ANY MAN CHOSEN FOR ME AND THAT I MUST CHOOSE THE MAN MYSELF ALTHOUGH I WAS VERY POLITE I WAS ALSO VERY FIRM AND MISTER PLATT AND HIS FRIENDS FINALLY ABANDONED THEIR POSITION
2674-155968-0051 A VETERAN OF THE CIVIL WAR COLONEL PARTRIDGE WHO HAD SERVED IN MAYOR LOW'S ADMINISTRATION HE WAS AN EXCELLENT MAN IN EVERY WAY HE CHOSE AS HIS ASSISTANT ACTIVELY TO SUPERINTEND THE WORK
2674-155968-0052 A MAN WITH NO POLITICAL BACKING AT ALL PICKED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS THE BEST EQUIPPED MAN FOR THE PLACE THE OFFICE THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE UNDER ME WAS RUN IN ADMIRABLE FASHION THROUGHOUT MY ADMINISTRATION
2674-155968-0053 RUN WITH A HIGHER STANDARD OF EFFICIENCY AND INTEGRITY BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THAT HAD TO BE DONE ABOUT THE CANALS EVIDENTLY THE WHOLE POLICY HITHERTO PURSUED HAD BEEN FOOLISH AND INADEQUATE
2674-155968-0054 I APPOINTED A FIRST CLASS NON PARTISAN COMMISSION OF BUSINESS MEN AND EXPERT ENGINEERS WHO WENT INTO THE MATTER EXHAUSTIVELY AND THEIR REPORT SERVED AS THE BASIS UPON WHICH OUR ENTIRE PRESENT CANAL SYSTEM IS BASED
2674-155968-0055 AND WHOM I HAD DECLINED TO REAPPOINT HAD BEEN GUILTY OF ANY ACTION BECAUSE OF WHICH IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PROCEED AGAINST THEM CRIMINALLY OR OTHERWISE UNDER THE LAW SUCH CRIMINAL ACTION HAD BEEN FREELY CHARGED AGAINST THEM DURING THE CAMPAIGN BY THE DEMOCRATIC
2674-155968-0056 INCLUDING THE SO CALLED MUGWUMP PRESS TO DETERMINE THIS MATTER I APPOINTED TWO DEMOCRATIC LAWYERS MESSRS FOX AND MAC FARLANE THE LATTER FEDERAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR NEW YORK UNDER PRESIDENT CLEVELAND AND PUT THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION IN THEIR HANDS
2674-155968-0057 THESE GENTLEMEN MADE AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION LASTING SEVERAL MONTHS THEY REPORTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN GRAVE DELINQUENCY IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE WORK DELINQUENCY WHICH JUSTIFIED PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT WHO WERE OUT OF OFFICE
2674-155968-0058 BUT THAT THERE WAS NO GROUND FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION I LAID THEIR REPORT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A MESSAGE IN WHICH I SAID THERE IS PROBABLY NO LAWYER OF HIGH STANDING IN THE STATE WHO
2674-155968-0059 AFTER STUDYING THE REPORT OF COUNSEL IN THIS CASE AND THE TESTIMONY TAKEN BY THE INVESTIGATING COMMISSION WOULD DISAGREE WITH THEM AS TO THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF A SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONE REMEDY WAS A THOROUGH CHANGE IN THE METHODS AND MANAGEMENT
2674-155968-0060 THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE WHEN MY SUCCESSOR IN THE GOVERNORSHIP TOOK OFFICE COLONEL PARTRIDGE RETIRED AND ELON HOOKER FINDING THAT HE COULD NO LONGER ACT WITH ENTIRE DISREGARD OF POLITICS AND WITH AN EYE SINGLE TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WORK ALSO LEFT
2674-155968-0061 A DOZEN YEARS LATER HAVING IN THE MEANTIME MADE A MARKED SUCCESS IN A BUSINESS CAREER HE BECAME THE TREASURER OF THE NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE PARTY MY ACTION IN REGARD TO THE CANALS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OFFICE THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE UNDER ME BY COLONEL PARTRIDGE
2674-155968-0062 ESTABLISHED MY RELATIONS WITH MISTER PLATT FROM THE OUTSET ON PRETTY NEARLY THE RIGHT BASIS BUT BESIDES VARIOUS SMALL DIFFICULTIES WE HAD ONE OR TWO SERIOUS BITS OF TROUBLE BEFORE MY DUTIES AS GOVERNOR CEASED IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT MISTER PLATT WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES
2674-155968-0063 A LARGE PART OF AND SOMETIMES A MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE THERE WERE A FEW ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT MEN SUCH AS NATHANIEL ELSBERG REGIS POST AND ALFORD COOLEY IN EACH OF THE TWO HOUSES THE REMAINDER WERE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC BOSSES
2674-155968-0064 THE TWO MACHINES WERE APT TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE IF THEIR VITAL INTERESTS WERE TOUCHED IT WAS MY BUSINESS TO DEVISE METHODS BY WHICH EITHER THE TWO MACHINES COULD BE KEPT APART OR ELSE OVERTHROWN IF THEY CAME TOGETHER MY DESIRE WAS TO ACHIEVE RESULTS
2674-155968-0065 AND NOT MERELY TO ISSUE MANIFESTOES OF VIRTUE IT IS VERY EASY TO BE EFFICIENT IF THE EFFICIENCY IS BASED ON UNSCRUPULOUSNESS AND IT IS STILL EASIER TO BE VIRTUOUS IF ONE IS CONTENT WITH THE PURELY NEGATIVE VIRTUE WHICH CONSISTS IN NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG
2674-155968-0066 BUT BEING WHOLLY UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING POSITIVE FOR GOOD MY FAVORITE QUOTATION FROM JOSH BILLINGS AGAIN APPLIES IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO BE A HARMLESS DOVE THAN A WISE SERPENT MY DUTY WAS TO COMBINE BOTH IDEALISM AND EFFICIENCY
2674-155968-0067 AT THAT TIME THE PUBLIC CONSCIENCE WAS STILL DORMANT AS REGARDS MANY SPECIES OF POLITICAL AND BUSINESS MISCONDUCT AS TO WHICH DURING THE NEXT DECADE IT BECAME SENSITIVE I HAD TO WORK WITH THE TOOLS AT HAND
2674-155968-0068 AND TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FEELING OF THE PEOPLE WHICH I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED MY AIM WAS PERSISTENTLY TO REFUSE TO BE PUT IN A POSITION WHERE WHAT I DID WOULD SEEM TO BE A MERE FACTION STRUGGLE AGAINST SENATOR PLATT MY AIM WAS TO MAKE A FIGHT ONLY WHEN I COULD SO MANAGE IT
2674-155968-0069 THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION IN THE MINDS OF HONEST MEN THAT MY PRIME PURPOSE WAS NOT TO ATTACK MISTER PLATT OR ANY ONE ELSE EXCEPT AS A NECESSARY INCIDENT TO SECURING CLEAN AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT IN EACH CASE I DID MY BEST TO PERSUADE MISTER PLATT NOT TO OPPOSE ME
2674-155968-0070 I ENDEAVORED TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO HIM THAT I WAS NOT TRYING TO WREST THE ORGANIZATION FROM HIM AND I ALWAYS GAVE HIM IN DETAIL THE REASONS WHY I FELT I HAD TO TAKE THE POSITION I INTENDED TO ADOPT IT WAS ONLY AFTER I HAD EXHAUSTED ALL THE RESOURCES OF MY PATIENCE
2674-155968-0071 THAT I WOULD FINALLY IF HE STILL PROVED OBSTINATE TELL HIM THAT I INTENDED TO MAKE THE FIGHT ANYHOW AS I HAVE SAID THE SENATOR WAS AN OLD AND FEEBLE MAN IN PHYSIQUE AND IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GO ABOUT VERY LITTLE
2674-155968-0072 UNTIL FRIDAY EVENING HE WOULD BE KEPT AT HIS DUTIES AT WASHINGTON WHILE I WAS IN ALBANY IF I WISHED TO SEE HIM IT GENERALLY HAD TO BE AT HIS HOTEL IN NEW YORK ON SATURDAY AND USUALLY I WOULD GO THERE TO BREAKFAST WITH HIM THE ONE THING I WOULD NOT PERMIT
2674-155968-0073 WAS ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A SECRET OR CLANDESTINE MEETING I ALWAYS INSISTED ON GOING OPENLY SOLEMN REFORMERS OF THE TOM FOOL VARIETY WHO ACCORDING TO THEIR CUSTOM
2674-155968-0074 WERE MUCH EXERCISED OVER MY BREAKFASTING WITH PLATT WHENEVER I BREAKFASTED WITH HIM THEY BECAME SURE THAT THE FACT CARRIED WITH IT SOME SINISTER SIGNIFICANCE THE WORTHY CREATURES NEVER TOOK THE TROUBLE TO FOLLOW THE SEQUENCE OF FACTS AND EVENTS FOR THEMSELVES
2674-155968-0075 IF THEY HAD DONE SO THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ANY SERIES OF BREAKFASTS WITH PLATT
2674-155968-0076 AND THAT I WAS TRYING COURTEOUSLY AND FRANKLY TO RECONCILE HIM TO IT MY OBJECT WAS TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO COME WITH ME AS LONG AS THERE WAS NO CLASH BETWEEN US THERE WAS NO OBJECT IN MY SEEING HIM
2674-155968-0077 IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE CLASH CAME OR WAS IMMINENT THAT I HAD TO SEE HIM A SERIES OF BREAKFASTS WAS ALWAYS THE PRELUDE TO SOME ACTIVE WARFARE IN EVERY INSTANCE I SUBSTANTIALLY CARRIED MY POINT
2674-155968-0078 TO ILLUSTRATE MY MEANING I QUOTE FROM A LETTER OF MINE TO SENATOR PLATT OF DECEMBER THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET ME TO PROMOTE A CERTAIN JUDGE X OVER THE HEAD OF ANOTHER JUDGE Y I WROTE
2674-155968-0079 THERE IS A STRONG FEELING AMONG THE JUDGES AND THE LEADING MEMBERS OF THE BAR THAT JUDGE Y OUGHT NOT TO HAVE JUDGE X JUMPED OVER HIS HEAD AND I DO NOT SEE MY WAY CLEAR TO DOING IT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE SOLUTION I MENTIONED TO YOU
2674-155968-0080 IS THE SOLUTION I SHALL HAVE TO ADOPT REMEMBER THE BREAKFAST AT DOUGLAS ROBINSON'S AT EIGHT THIRTY THERE WERE VARIOUS MEASURES TO WHICH HE GAVE A GRUDGING AND QUERULOUS ASSENT WITHOUT ANY BREAK BEING THREATENED I SECURED THE REENACTMENT OF THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW
2674-155968-0081 WHICH UNDER MY PREDECESSOR HAD VERY FOOLISHLY BEEN REPEALED I SECURED A MASS OF LABOR LEGISLATION INCLUDING THE ENACTMENT OF LAWS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FACTORY INSPECTORS TO CREATE A TENEMENT HOUSE COMMISSION
2674-155968-0082 WHOSE FINDINGS RESULTED IN FURTHER AND EXCELLENT LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE HOUSING CONDITIONS TO REGULATE AND IMPROVE SWEATSHOP LABOR TO MAKE THE EIGHT HOUR AND PREVAILING RATE OF WAGES LAW EFFECTIVE
2674-155968-0083 TO SECURE THE GENUINE ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACT RELATING TO THE HOURS OF RAILWAY WORKERS TO COMPEL RAILWAYS TO EQUIP FREIGHT TRAINS WITH AIR BRAKES TO REGULATE THE WORKING HOURS OF WOMEN AND PROTECT BOTH WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM DANGEROUS MACHINERY
2674-155968-0084 TO PROVIDE SEATS FOR THE USE OF WAITRESSES IN HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS TO REDUCE THE HOURS OF LABOR FOR DRUG STORE CLERKS TO PROVIDE FOR THE REGISTRATION OF LABORERS FOR MUNICIPAL EMPLOYMENT
2674-155968-0085 I TRIED HARD BUT FAILED TO SECURE AN EMPLOYERS LIABILITY LAW AND THE STATE CONTROL OF EMPLOYMENT OFFICES THERE WAS HARD FIGHTING OVER SOME OF THESE BILLS AND WHAT WAS MUCH MORE SERIOUS THERE WAS EFFORT TO GET ROUND THE LAW BY TRICKERY
2674-155968-0086 AND BY SECURING ITS INEFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT
2674-155968-0087 MEN SUCH AS JAMES BRONSON REYNOLDS THROUGH WHOM I FIRST BECAME INTERESTED IN SETTLEMENT WORK ON THE EAST SIDE ONCE OR TWICE I WENT SUDDENLY DOWN TO NEW YORK CITY WITHOUT WARNING ANY ONE AND TRAVERSED THE TENEMENT HOUSE QUARTERS VISITING VARIOUS SWEAT SHOPS PICKED AT RANDOM
2674-155968-0088 JAKE RIIS ACCOMPANIED ME
2674-155968-0089 WE GOT NOT ONLY AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE LAW BUT A STILL MORE MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN ITS ADMINISTRATION THANKS CHIEFLY TO THE ACTIVITY AND GOOD SENSE OF DOCTOR JOHN H PRYOR OF BUFFALO AND BY THE USE OF EVERY POUND OF PRESSURE WHICH AS GOVERNOR I COULD BRING TO BEAR
2674-155968-0090 IN LEGITIMATE FASHION INCLUDING A SPECIAL EMERGENCY MESSAGE WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THROUGH A BILL PROVIDING FOR THE FIRST STATE HOSPITAL FOR INCIPIENT TUBERCULOSIS WE GOT VALUABLE LAWS FOR THE FARMER
2674-155968-0091 LAWS PREVENTING THE ADULTERATION OF FOOD PRODUCTS WHICH LAWS WERE EQUALLY VALUABLE TO THE CONSUMER AND LAWS HELPING THE DAIRYMAN IN ADDITION TO LABOR LEGISLATION I WAS ABLE TO DO A GOOD DEAL FOR FOREST PRESERVATION AND THE PROTECTION OF OUR WILD LIFE
2674-155968-0092 ALL THAT LATER I STROVE FOR IN THE NATION IN CONNECTION WITH CONSERVATION WAS FORESHADOWED BY WHAT I STROVE TO OBTAIN FOR NEW YORK STATE WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR AND I WAS ALREADY WORKING IN CONNECTION WITH GIFFORD PINCHOT AND NEWELL
2674-155968-0093 I SECURED BETTER ADMINISTRATION AND SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE LAWS THEMSELVES THE IMPROVEMENT IN ADMINISTRATION AND IN THE CHARACTER OF THE GAME AND FOREST WARDENS WAS SECURED PARTLY AS THE RESULT OF A CONFERENCE
2674-155968-0094 IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBER WHICH I HELD WITH FORTY OF THE BEST GUIDES AND WOODSMEN OF THE ADIRONDACKS AS REGARDS MOST LEGISLATION EVEN THAT AFFECTING LABOR AND THE FORESTS I GOT ON FAIRLY WELL WITH THE MACHINE BUT ON THE TWO ISSUES IN WHICH BIG BUSINESS
2674-155968-0095 AND THE KIND OF POLITICS WHICH IS ALLIED TO BIG BUSINESS WERE MOST INVOLVED WE CLASHED HARD AND CLASHING WITH SENATOR PLATT MEANT CLASHING WITH THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION AND WITH THE ORGANIZED MAJORITY IN EACH HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE
2674-155968-0096 ONE CLASH WAS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE A MAN WHOSE OFFICE MADE HIM A FACTOR OF IMMENSE IMPORTANCE IN THE BIG BUSINESS CIRCLES OF NEW YORK THE THEN INCUMBENT OF THE OFFICE WAS AN EFFICIENT MAN THE BOSS OF AN UP STATE COUNTY
2674-155968-0097 A VETERAN POLITICIAN AND ONE OF MISTER PLATT'S RIGHT HAND MEN CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS WHICH I MADE IN THE COURSE OF THE FIGHT SHOWED THAT THIS SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE
2674-155968-0098 THESE OPERATIONS HAD THROWN HIM INTO A PECULIARLY INTIMATE BUSINESS CONTACT OF ONE SORT AND ANOTHER WITH VARIOUS FINANCIERS WITH WHOM I DID NOT DEEM IT EXPEDIENT THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE WHILE SUCH SHOULD HAVE ANY INTIMATE AND SECRET MONEY MAKING RELATIONS
2674-155968-0099 MOREOVER THE GENTLEMAN IN QUESTION REPRESENTED THE STRAITEST SECT OF THE OLD TIME SPOILS POLITICIANS I THEREFORE DETERMINED NOT TO REAPPOINT HIM UNLESS I COULD GET HIS SUCCESSOR CONFIRMED HOWEVER HE WOULD STAY IN UNDER THE LAW
2674-155968-0100 AND THE REPUBLICAN MACHINE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF TAMMANY EXPECTED TO CONTROL FAR MORE THAN A MAJORITY OF ALL THE SENATORS MISTER PLATT ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM TO ME THAT THE INCUMBENT MUST BE REAPPOINTED OR ELSE THAT HE WOULD FIGHT
2674-155968-0101 AND THAT IF HE CHOSE TO FIGHT THE MAN WOULD STAY IN ANYHOW BECAUSE I COULD NOT OUST HIM FOR UNDER THE NEW YORK CONSTITUTION THE ASSENT OF THE SENATE WAS NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO APPOINT A MAN TO OFFICE BUT TO REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE AS ALWAYS WITH MISTER PLATT
2674-155968-0102 I PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO LOSE MY TEMPER NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID HE WAS MUCH TOO OLD AND PHYSICALLY FEEBLE FOR THERE TO BE ANY POINT OF HONOR IN TAKING UP ANY OF HIS REMARKS AND I MERELY EXPLAINED GOOD HUMOREDLY THAT I HAD MADE UP MY MIND AND THAT THE GENTLEMAN IN QUESTION WOULD NOT BE RETAINED
2674-155968-0103 AS FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO GET HIS SUCCESSOR CONFIRMED I POINTED OUT THAT AS SOON AS THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNED I COULD AND WOULD APPOINT ANOTHER MAN TEMPORARILY MISTER PLATT THEN SAID THAT THE INCUMBENT WOULD BE PUT BACK AS SOON AS THE LEGISLATURE RECONVENED
2674-155968-0104 I ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLE BUT ADDED CHEERFULLY THAT I WOULD REMOVE HIM AGAIN JUST AS SOON AS THAT LEGISLATURE ADJOURNED AND THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE TIME MYSELF I WOULD GUARANTEE TO MAKE MY OPPONENTS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE STILL
2674-155968-0105 WE PARTED WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF REACHING AN AGREEMENT THERE REMAINED SOME WEEKS BEFORE FINAL ACTION COULD BE TAKEN AND THE SENATOR WAS CONFIDENT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO YIELD HIS MOST EFFICIENT ALLIES WERE THE PRETENDED REFORMERS
2674-155968-0106 MOST OF THEM MY OPEN OR COVERT ENEMIES WHO LOUDLY INSISTED THAT I MUST MAKE AN OPEN FIGHT ON THE SENATOR HIMSELF AND ON THE REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION THIS WAS WHAT HE WISHED FOR AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO WAY OF UPSETTING HIM WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
2674-155968-0107 IF I HAD PERMITTED THE CONTEST TO ASSUME THE SHAPE OF A MERE FACTION FIGHT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE UNITED STATES SENATOR I WOULD HAVE INSURED THE VICTORY OF THE MACHINE SO I BLANDLY REFUSED TO LET THE THING BECOME A PERSONAL FIGHT EXPLAINING AGAIN AND AGAIN
2674-155968-0108 THAT I WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO APPOINT AN ORGANIZATION MAN
2674-155968-0109 BUT ALSO EXPLAINING THAT I WOULD NOT RETAIN THE INCUMBENT AND WOULD NOT APPOINT ANY MAN OF HIS TYPE MEANWHILE
