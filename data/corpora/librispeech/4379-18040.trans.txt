4379-18040-0000 AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHAT AN ABSURD REQUEST IF ALL THE CONDITIONS WERE FAVORABLE THE STORY OF MY PUBLIC LIFE COULD NOT BE MADE INTERESTING IT DOES NOT SEEM POSSIBLE THAT ANY WILL CARE TO READ SO PLAIN AND UNEVENTFUL A TALE
4379-18040-0001 NOT A NEWSPAPER NOTICE OR ACCOUNT NOT A MAGAZINE ARTICLE
4379-18040-0002 THAN I EVER PLANNED OR HOPED THAT A BIOGRAPHY WRITTEN TRUTHFULLY WOULD BE MOSTLY AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE DONE FOR ME I HAVE LIVED TO SEE ACCOMPLISHED FAR MORE THAN MY HIGHEST AMBITION INCLUDED
4379-18040-0003 THE REALITIES ARE LIKE DREAMS TO ME BLESSINGS ON THE LOVING HEARTS AND NOBLE MINDS WHO HAVE BEEN SO WILLING TO SACRIFICE FOR OTHERS GOOD AND TO THINK ONLY OF WHAT THEY COULD DO AND NEVER OF WHAT THEY SHOULD GET
4379-18040-0004 I HAD FROM CHILDHOOD FELT THAT I WAS CALLED TO THE MINISTRY THE EARLIEST EVENT OF MEMORY IS THE PRAYER OF MY FATHER AT FAMILY PRAYERS IN THE LITTLE OLD COTTAGE IN THE HAMPSHIRE HIGHLANDS OF THE BERKSHIRE HILLS
4379-18040-0005 CALLING ON GOD WITH A SOBBING VOICE TO LEAD ME INTO SOME SPECIAL SERVICE FOR THE SAVIOUR IT FILLED ME WITH AWE DREAD AND FEAR AND I RECOILED FROM THE THOUGHT UNTIL I DETERMINED TO FIGHT AGAINST IT WITH ALL MY POWER
4379-18040-0006 FOR MY SUPPRESSED SENSE OF DUTY AND MY FIRST LECTURE WAS ON THE LESSONS OF HISTORY AS APPLIED TO THE CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE CONFEDERACY THAT MATCHLESS TEMPERANCE ORATOR AND LOVING FRIEND JOHN B GOUGH INTRODUCED ME
4379-18040-0007 TO THE LITTLE AUDIENCE IN WESTFIELD MASSACHUSETTS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
4379-18040-0008 THE WAY TO PUBLIC ORATORY WOULD NOT BE SO HARD AS I HAD FEARED FROM THAT TIME I ACTED ON MISTER GOUGH'S ADVICE AND SOUGHT PRACTICE BY ACCEPTING ALMOST EVERY INVITATION I RECEIVED TO SPEAK
4379-18040-0009 THERE WERE MANY SAD FAILURES AND TEARS BUT IT WAS A RESTFUL COMPROMISE WITH MY CONSCIENCE CONCERNING THE MINISTRY AND IT PLEASED MY FRIENDS I ADDRESSED PICNICS SUNDAY SCHOOLS PATRIOTIC MEETINGS FUNERALS ANNIVERSARIES
4379-18040-0010 COMMENCEMENTS DEBATES CATTLE SHOWS AND SEWING CIRCLES WITHOUT PARTIALITY AND WITHOUT PRICE FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS THE INCOME WAS ALL EXPERIENCE THEN VOLUNTARY GIFTS
4379-18040-0011 BEGAN TO COME OCCASIONALLY IN THE SHAPE OF A JACK KNIFE A HAM A BOOK AND THE FIRST CASH REMUNERATION WAS FROM A FARMERS CLUB OF SEVENTY FIVE CENTS TOWARD THE HORSE HIRE
4379-18040-0012 IT WAS A CURIOUS FACT THAT ONE MEMBER OF THAT CLUB AFTERWARD MOVED TO SALT LAKE CITY AND WAS A MEMBER
4379-18040-0013 WHICH WHEN I WAS A CORRESPONDENT ON A JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD EMPLOYED ME TO LECTURE ON MEN OF THE MOUNTAINS IN THE MORMON TABERNACLE AT A FEE OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHILE I WAS GAINING PRACTICE IN THE FIRST YEARS OF PLATFORM WORK
4379-18040-0014 I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE PROFITABLE EMPLOYMENT AS A SOLDIER OR AS A CORRESPONDENT OR LAWYER OR AS AN EDITOR OR AS A PREACHER WHICH ENABLED ME TO PAY MY OWN EXPENSES
4379-18040-0015 IN THE FIFTY YEARS THAT I HAVE EVER TAKEN A FEE FOR MY PERSONAL USE IN THE LAST THIRTY SIX YEARS
4379-18040-0016 AT AN AVERAGE INCOME OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR EACH LECTURE IT WAS A REMARKABLE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH CAME TO ME AS A LECTURER WHEN MISTER JAMES REDPATH ORGANIZED THE FIRST LECTURE BUREAU EVER ESTABLISHED
4379-18040-0017 WHILE A STUDENT ON VACATION IN SELLING THAT LIFE OF JOHN BROWN THAT ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER REDPATH WAS MAINTAINED UNTIL MISTER REDPATH'S DEATH
4379-18040-0018 TO GENERAL CHARLES H TAYLOR WITH WHOM I WAS EMPLOYED FOR A TIME AS REPORTER FOR THE BOSTON DAILY TRAVELER I WAS INDEBTED
4379-18040-0019 FOR MANY ACTS OF SELF SACRIFICING FRIENDSHIP WHICH SOFTEN MY SOUL AS I RECALL THEM HE DID ME THE GREATEST KINDNESS WHEN HE SUGGESTED MY NAME TO MISTER REDPATH AS ONE WHO COULD FILL IN THE VACANCIES IN THE SMALLER TOWNS

4379-18040-0023 GENERAL BENJAMIN F BUTLER HOWEVER ADVISED ME TO STICK TO THE LAST AND BE A GOOD LAWYER THE WORK OF LECTURING WAS ALWAYS A TASK AND A DUTY I DO NOT FEEL NOW THAT I EVER SOUGHT TO BE AN ENTERTAINER
4379-18040-0024 BUT FOR THE FEELING THAT I MUST PREACH SOME GOSPEL TRUTH IN MY LECTURES
4379-18040-0025 THE WAY IS NOT ALWAYS SMOOTH BUT THE HARD ROADS THE POOR HOTELS THE LATE TRAINS THE COLD HALLS
4379-18040-0026 IF I DID NOT IN FIFTY YEARS OF TRAVEL IN ALL SORTS OF CONVEYANCES MEET WITH ACCIDENTS
4379-18040-0027 YET I DID NOT MISS A SINGLE ENGAGEMENT SOMETIMES I HAD TO HIRE A SPECIAL TRAIN BUT I REACHED THE TOWN ON TIME WITH ONLY A RARE EXCEPTION AND THEN I WAS BUT A FEW MINUTES LATE ACCIDENTS HAVE PRECEDED
