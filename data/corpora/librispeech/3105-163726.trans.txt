3105-163726-0000 THEY DID ME THE HONOUR TO CONSULT ME FIRST AND TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF MY ADVICE FOR I BEGGED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A GOOD SIZED COW ON IT SO AS TO STAMP OUR PATS OF BUTTER BEFORE THEY WENT TO MARKET ALSO A HORSE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND A FLOCK SNOWED UP AT THE BOTTOM
3105-163726-0001 THEY INQUIRED STRICTLY INTO THE ANNALS OF OUR FAMILY I TOLD THEM OF COURSE ALL ABOUT KING ALFRED UPON WHICH THEY SETTLED THAT ONE QUARTER SHOULD BE THREE CAKES ON A BAR WITH A LION REGARDANT DONE UPON A FIELD OF GOLD
3105-163726-0002 ALSO I TOLD THEM THAT VERY LIKELY THERE HAD BEEN A RIDD IN THE BATTLE FOUGHT NOT VERY FAR FROM PLOVER'S BARROWS BY THE EARL OF DEVON AGAINST THE DANES WHEN HUBBA THEIR CHIEF WAS KILLED AND THE SACRED STANDARD TAKEN
3105-163726-0003 AS SOME OF THE DANES ARE SAID TO BE BURIED EVEN UPON LAND OF OURS AND WE CALL THEIR GRAVES IF SUCH THEY BE EVEN TO THIS DAY BARROWS THE HERALDS QUITE AGREED WITH ME THAT A RIDD MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE OR THEREABOUTS AND IF HE WAS THERE
3105-163726-0004 HE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN TO HAVE DONE HIS BEST BEING IN SIGHT OF HEARTH AND HOME
3105-163726-0005 AND GOOD LEGS ARE AN ARGUMENT FOR GOOD ARMS AND SUPPOSING A MAN OF THIS SORT TO HAVE DONE HIS UTMOST AS THE MANNER OF THE RIDDS IS IT WAS NEXT TO CERTAIN THAT HE HIMSELF MUST HAVE CAPTURED THE STANDARD MOREOVER THE NAME OF OUR FARM WAS PURE PROOF
3105-163726-0006 A PLOVER BEING A WILD BIRD JUST THE SAME AS A RAVEN IS UPON THIS CHAIN OF REASONING AND WITHOUT ANY WEAK MISGIVINGS
3105-163726-0007 AND THE NEXT THING WHICH I MENTIONED POSSESSING ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY TO WIT THAT A PIG WITH TWO HEADS HAD BEEN BORN UPON OUR FARM NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGONE ALTHOUGH HE DIED WITHIN A WEEK MY THIRD QUARTER WAS MADE AT ONCE BY A TWO HEADED BOAR WITH NOBLE TUSKS
3105-163726-0008 SABLE UPON SILVER ALL THIS WAS VERY FIERCE AND FINE AND SO I PRESSED FOR A PEACEFUL CORNER IN THE LOWER DEXTER AND OBTAINED A WHEAT SHEAF SET UPRIGHT GOLD UPON A FIELD OF GREEN HERE I WAS INCLINED TO PAUSE AND ADMIRE THE EFFECT
3105-163726-0009 FOR EVEN DE WHICHEHALSE COULD NOT SHOW A BEARING SO MAGNIFICENT BUT THE HERALDS SAID THAT IT LOOKED A MERE SIGN BOARD WITHOUT A GOOD MOTTO UNDER IT AND THE MOTTO MUST HAVE MY NAME IN IT THEY OFFERED ME FIRST RIDD NON RIDENDUS
3105-163726-0010 BUT I SAID FOR GOD'S SAKE GENTLEMEN LET ME FORGET MY LATIN THEN THEY PROPOSED RIDD READETH RIDDLES BUT I BEGGED THEM NOT TO SET DOWN SUCH A LIE FOR NO RIDD EVER HAD MADE OR MADE OUT SUCH A THING AS A RIDDLE SINCE EXMOOR ITSELF BEGAN
3105-163726-0011 DECLINED IN THE MOST DECIDED MANNER TO PAY A FARTHING TOWARDS IT AND AS I HAD NOW NO MONEY LEFT THE HERALDS BECAME AS BLUE AS AZURE AND AS RED AS GULES UNTIL HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN CAME FORWARD VERY KINDLY AND SAID THAT IF HIS MAJESTY GAVE ME A COAT OF ARMS
3105-163726-0012 I WAS NOT TO PAY FOR IT THEREFORE SHE HERSELF DID SO QUITE HANDSOMELY AND FELT GOODWILL TOWARDS ME IN CONSEQUENCE NOW BEING IN A HURRY SO FAR AT LEAST AS IT IS IN MY NATURE TO HURRY TO GET TO THE END OF THIS NARRATIVE
3105-163726-0013 IS IT LIKELY THAT I WOULD HAVE DWELLED SO LONG UPON MY COAT OF ARMS BUT FOR SOME GOOD REASON AND THIS GOOD REASON IS THAT LORNA TOOK THE GREATEST PRIDE IN IT AND THOUGHT OR AT ANY RATE SAID THAT IT QUITE THREW INTO THE SHADE AND ECLIPSED ALL HER OWN ANCIENT GLORIES
3105-163726-0014 AND HALF IN FUN AND HALF IN EARNEST SHE CALLED ME SIR JOHN SO CONTINUALLY THAT AT LAST I WAS ALMOST ANGRY WITH HER UNTIL HER EYES WERE BEDEWED WITH TEARS AND THEN I WAS ANGRY WITH MYSELF BEGINNING TO BE SHORT OF MONEY
3105-163726-0015 FROM THAT AWFUL CIRCUIT OF SHAMBLES THROUGH WHICH HIS NAME IS STILL USED BY MOTHERS TO FRIGHTEN THEIR CHILDREN INTO BED AND RIGHT GLAD WAS I FOR EVEN LONDON SHRANK WITH HORROR AT THE NEWS TO ESCAPE A MAN SO BLOODTHIRSTY SAVAGE
3105-163726-0016 AND EVEN TO HIS FRIENDS AMONG WHOM I WAS RECKONED MALIGNANT EARL BRANDIR WAS GREATLY PLEASED WITH ME NOT ONLY FOR HAVING SAVED HIS LIFE BUT FOR SAVING THAT WHICH HE VALUED MORE THE WEALTH LAID BY FOR LORD ALAN
3105-163726-0017 PRAYING MY COMMENDATION DEMANDED OF ME ONE THING ONLY TO SPEAK OF HIM AS I FOUND HIM AS I HAD FOUND HIM MANY A SUNDAY FURBISHING UP OLD FURS FOR NEW WITH A GLAZE TO CONCEAL THE MOTHS RAVAGES
3105-163726-0018 I BEGGED HIM TO RECONSIDER THE POINT AND NOT TO DEMAND SUCH ACCURACY HE SAID WELL WELL ALL TRADES HAD TRICKS ESPECIALLY THE TRICK OF BUSINESS AND I MUST TAKE HIM IF I WERE HIS TRUE FRIEND ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DESCRIPTION
3105-163726-0019 THIS I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO DO BECAUSE IT SAVED SO MUCH TROUBLE AND I HAD NO MONEY TO SPEND WITH HIM BUT STILL HE REQUESTED THE USE OF MY NAME AND I BEGGED HIM TO DO THE BEST WITH IT AS I NEVER HAD KEPT A BANKER
3105-163726-0020 WITH THE RASP OF WINTER BRISTLES RISING THROUGH AND AMONG THE SOFT SUMMER COAT AND WHEN THE NEW STRAW BEGAN TO COME IN GOLDEN WITH THE HARVEST GLOSS AND SMELLING MOST DIVINELY AT THOSE STRANGE LIVERY STABLES WHERE THE NAGS ARE PUT QUITE TAIL TO TAIL
3105-163726-0021 AND WHEN ALL THE LONDON FOLK THEMSELVES ARE ASKING ABOUT WHITE FROST FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD THEN I SAY SUCH A YEARNING SEIZED ME FOR MOORY CRAG AND FOR DEWY BLADE AND EVEN THE GRUNTING OF OUR SHEEP WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN
3105-163726-0022 THAT NOTHING BUT THE NEW WISPS OF SAMSON COULD HAVE HELD ME IN LONDON TOWN LORNA WAS MOVED WITH EQUAL LONGING TOWARDS THE COUNTRY AND COUNTRY WAYS AND SHE SPOKE QUITE AS MUCH OF THE GLISTENING DEW AS SHE DID OF THE SMELL OF OUR OVEN
3105-163726-0023 AND HERE LET ME MENTION ALTHOUGH THE TWO ARE QUITE DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT
3105-163726-0024 WHETHER HIGH OR LOW BUT NEVER FOUND ELSEWHERE THE DEW IS SO CRISP AND PURE AND PEARLY AND IN SUCH ABUNDANCE AND THE BREAD IS SO SWEET SO KIND AND HOMELY YOU CAN EAT A LOAF AND THEN ANOTHER
3105-163726-0025 NOW WHILE I WAS WALKING DAILY IN AND OUT GREAT CROWDS OF MEN FEW OF WHOM HAD ANY FREEDOM FROM THE CARES OF MONEY AND MANY OF WHOM WERE EVEN MORBID WITH A WORSE PEST CALLED POLITICS I COULD NOT BE QUIT OF THINKING HOW WE JOSTLE ONE ANOTHER
3105-163726-0026 GOD HAS MADE THE EARTH QUITE LARGE WITH A SPREAD OF LAND LARGE ENOUGH FOR ALL TO LIVE ON WITHOUT FIGHTING ALSO A MIGHTY SPREAD OF WATER LAYING HANDS ON SAND AND CLIFF WITH A SOLEMN VOICE IN STORM TIME
3105-163726-0027 SUCH A MAN MUST BE VERY WRETCHED IN THIS PURE DEARTH OF MORALITY LIKE A FISHERMAN WHERE NO FISH BE AND MOST OF US HAVE ENOUGH TO DO TO ATTEND TO OUR OWN MORALS ENOUGH THAT I RESOLVED TO GO
3105-163726-0028 NEARLY EVERYBODY VOWED THAT I WAS A GREAT FOOL INDEED TO NEGLECT SO RUDELY WHICH WAS THE PROPER WORD THEY SAID THE PUSHING OF MY FORTUNES BUT I ANSWERED THAT TO PUSH WAS RUDE AND I LEFT IT TO PEOPLE WHO HAD NO ROOM AND THOUGHT THAT MY FORTUNE MUST BE HEAVY
3105-163726-0029 LORNA CRIED WHEN I CAME AWAY WHICH GAVE ME GREAT SATISFACTION AND SHE SENT A WHOLE TRUNKFUL OF THINGS FOR MOTHER AND ANNIE AND EVEN LIZZIE AND SHE SEEMED TO THINK THOUGH SHE SAID IT NOT THAT I MADE MY OWN OCCASION FOR GOING
3105-163726-0030 WHILE ALL THE TIME THERE WAS NOTHING WHATEVER EXCEPT MY OWN LOVE OF ADVENTURE AND SPORT TO KEEP ME FROM COMING HOME AGAIN BUT I KNEW THAT MY COAT OF ARMS AND TITLE WOULD TURN EVERY BIT OF THIS GRUMBLING INTO FINE ADMIRATION
3105-163726-0031 AND SO IT FELL OUT TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN EVEN I DESIRED FOR ALL THE PARISHES ROUND ABOUT UNITED IN A SUMPTUOUS DINNER AT THE MOTHER MELLDRUM INN FOR NOW THAT GOOD LADY WAS DEAD AND HER NAME AND FACE SET ON A SIGN POST TO WHICH I WAS INVITED
3105-163726-0032 IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THE REAL GENTRY FOR A LONG TIME TREATED MY NEW HONOURS WITH CONTEMPT AND RIDICULE BUT GRADUALLY AS THEY FOUND THAT I WAS NOT SUCH A FOOL AS TO CLAIM ANY EQUALITY WITH THEM BUT WENT ABOUT MY FARM WORK AND THREW ANOTHER MAN AT WRESTLING
3105-163726-0033 AND TOUCHED MY HAT TO THE MAGISTRATES JUST THE SAME AS EVER SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE HIGHEST BLOOD OF WHICH WE THINK A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN OF GOLD AROUND OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD ACTUALLY EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO MAKE MY ACQUAINTANCE
3105-163726-0034 AND WHEN IN A MANNER QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND WHOLLY FREE FROM BITTERNESS I THANKED THEM FOR THIS WHICH APPEARED TO ME THE HIGHEST HONOUR YET OFFERED ME
3105-163726-0035 AND THEMSELVES AS WELL IN A DIFFERENT WAY THEY DID WHAT NEARLY ALL ENGLISHMEN DO WHEN A THING IS RIGHT AND SENSIBLE THEY SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT DENY BUT THAT THERE WAS REASON IN MY VIEW OF THE MATTER AND ALTHOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MUST BE THE LOSERS WHICH WAS A HANDSOME THING TO SAY
3105-163726-0036 THEY WOULD WAIT UNTIL I WAS A LITTLE OLDER AND MORE AWARE OF MY OWN VALUE NOW THIS REMINDS ME HOW IT IS THAT AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IS SO FAR IN FRONT OF FOREIGN NOBLEMEN AND PRINCES I HAVE SEEN AT TIMES A LITTLE BOTH OF ONE AND OF THE OTHER
3105-163726-0037 AND MAKING MORE THAN DUE ALLOWANCE FOR THE DIFFICULTIES OF LANGUAGE AND THE DIFFERENCE OF TRAINING UPON THE WHOLE THE BALANCE IS IN FAVOUR OF OUR PEOPLE AND THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO WEIGHTS SOLID AND EVEN IN SCALE OF MANNERS OUTWEIGHING ALL LIGHT COMPLAISANCE TO WIT
3105-163726-0038 THE INBORN LOVE OF JUSTICE AND THE POWER OF ABIDING YET SOME PEOPLE MAY BE SURPRISED THAT MEN WITH ANY LOVE OF JUSTICE WHETHER INBORN OR OTHERWISE COULD CONTINUE TO ABIDE THE ARROGANCE AND RAPACITY AND TYRANNY OF THE DOONES
3105-163726-0039 AND TWO HOGSHEADS AND A HALF OF CIDER AND A HUNDREDWEIGHT OF CANDLES NOT TO MENTION OTHER THINGS OF ALMOST EVERY VARIETY WHICH THEY GOT BY INSISTING UPON IT SURELY THESE MIGHT HAVE SUFFICED TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IN THEIR PLACE WITH NO OUTBURST OF WANTONNESS
3105-163726-0040 NEVERTHELESS IT WAS NOT SO THEY HAD MADE COMPLAINT ABOUT SOMETHING TOO MUCH EWE MUTTON I THINK IT WAS AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE PLEDGES GIVEN THEY HAD RIDDEN FORTH AND CARRIED AWAY TWO MAIDENS OF OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD
3105-163726-0041 NOW THESE TWO MAIDENS WERE KNOWN BECAUSE THEY HAD SERVED THE BEER AT AN ALE HOUSE AND MANY MEN WHO HAD LOOKED AT THEM OVER A PINT OR QUART VESSEL ESPECIALLY AS THEY WERE COMELY GIRLS
3105-163726-0042 AND THEIR MOTHER ALTHOUGH SHE HAD TAKEN SOME MONEY WHICH THE DOONES WERE ALWAYS FULL OF DECLARED THAT IT WAS A ROBBERY AND THOUGH IT INCREASED FOR A WHILE THE CUSTOM THAT MUST SOON FALL OFF AGAIN AND WHO WOULD HAVE HER TWO GIRLS NOW CLEVER AS THEY WERE AND GOOD
3105-163726-0043 BEFORE WE HAD FINISHED MEDITATING UPON THIS LOOSE OUTRAGE FOR SO I AT LEAST WOULD CALL IT THOUGH PEOPLE ACCUSTOMED TO THE LAW MAY TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF IT WE HAD NEWS OF A THING FAR WORSE WHICH TURNED THE HEARTS OF OUR WOMEN SICK
3105-163726-0044 FOR HE COULD RUN SAY TWO YARDS ALONE AND PERHAPS FOUR OR FIVE BY HOLDING TO HANDLES AND HE HAD A WAY OF LOOKING ROUND AND SPREADING HIS LEGS AND LAUGHING WITH HIS BRAVE LITTLE BODY WELL FETCHED UP AFTER A DESPERATE JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE TABLE
3105-163726-0045 WHICH HIS MOTHER SAID NOTHING COULD EQUAL NEVERTHELESS HE WOULD COME TO BE NURSED AS REGULAR AS A CLOCK ALMOST AND INASMUCH AS HE WAS THE FIRST BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER MADE MUCH OF HIM FOR GOD ONLY KNEW WHETHER THEY COULD EVER COMPASS SUCH ANOTHER ONE
3105-163726-0046 CHRISTOPHER BADCOCK WAS A TENANT FARMER IN THE PARISH OF MARTINHOE RENTING SOME FIFTY ACRES OF LAND WITH A RIGHT OF COMMON ATTACHED TO THEM AND AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME BEING NOW THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY AND FINE OPEN WEATHER HE WAS HARD AT WORK PLOUGHING AND PREPARING FOR SPRING CORN
3105-163726-0047 THEREFORE HIS WIFE WAS NOT SURPRISED ALTHOUGH THE DUSK WAS FALLING THAT FARMER CHRISTOPHER SHOULD BE AT WORK IN BLIND MAN'S HOLIDAY AS WE CALL IT BUT SHE WAS SURPRISED NAY ASTONISHED WHEN BY THE LIGHT OF THE KITCHEN FIRE BRIGHTENED UP FOR HER HUSBAND
3105-163726-0048 SHE SAW SIX OR SEVEN GREAT ARMED MEN BURST INTO THE ROOM UPON HER AND SHE SCREAMED SO THAT THE MAID IN THE BACK KITCHEN HEARD HER BUT WAS AFRAID TO COME TO HELP TWO OF THE STRONGEST AND FIERCEST MEN AT ONCE SEIZED POOR YOUNG MARGERY AND THOUGH SHE FOUGHT FOR HER CHILD AND HOME
3105-163726-0049 SHE WAS BUT AN INFANT HERSELF IN THEIR HANDS IN SPITE OF TEARS AND SHRIEKS AND STRUGGLES THEY TORE THE BABE FROM THE MOTHER'S ARMS AND CAST IT ON THE LIME ASH FLOOR THEN THEY BORE HER AWAY TO THEIR HORSES FOR BY THIS TIME SHE WAS SENSELESS
3105-163726-0050 AND TELLING THE OTHERS TO SACK THE HOUSE RODE OFF WITH THEIR PRIZE TO THE VALLEY AND FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF ONE OF THOSE TWO WHO CARRIED OFF THE POOR WOMAN I KNEW BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT IT WAS CARVER DOONE HIMSELF THE OTHER DOONES BEING LEFT BEHIND AND GRIEVED PERHAPS IN SOME RESPECTS
3105-163726-0051 IN A WORD THEIR TASTE BEING OFFENDED THEY CAME BACK TO THE KITCHEN AND STAMPED AND THERE WAS THE BABY LYING BY EVIL LUCK THIS CHILD BEGAN TO SQUEAL ABOUT HIS MOTHER HAVING BEEN PETTED HITHERTO AND WONT TO GET ALL HE WANTED BY RAISING HIS VOICE BUT A LITTLE
3105-163726-0052 NOW THE MARK OF THE FLOOR WAS UPON HIS HEAD AS THE MAID WHO HAD STOLEN TO LOOK AT HIM WHEN THE ROUGH MEN WERE SWEARING UPSTAIRS GAVE EVIDENCE AND SHE PUT A DISH CLOTH UNDER HIS HEAD AND KISSED HIM AND RAN AWAY AGAIN
3105-163726-0053 AND SHE MEANT WHAT WAS RIGHT BY HER MASTER AND MISTRESS BUT COULD NOT HELP BEING FRIGHTENED AND MANY WOMEN HAVE BLAMED HER AS I THINK UNDULY FOR HER MODE OF FORSAKING BABY SO IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN BABY INSTINCT RATHER THAN REASON MIGHT HAVE HAD THE DAY WITH HER
3105-163726-0054 BUT THE CHILD BEING BORN OF HER MISTRESS SHE WISHED HIM GOOD LUCK AND LEFT HIM AS THE FIERCE MEN CAME DOWNSTAIRS AND BEING ALARMED BY THEIR POWER OF LANGUAGE BECAUSE THEY HAD FOUND NO SILVER SHE CREPT AWAY IN A BREATHLESS HURRY AND AFRAID HOW HER BREATH MIGHT COME BACK TO HER
3105-163726-0055 FOR OFTENTIME SHE HAD HICCOUGHS WHILE THIS GOOD MAID WAS IN THE OVEN BY SIDE OF BACK KITCHEN FIREPLACE WITH A FAGGOT OF WOOD DRAWN OVER HER AND LYING SO THAT HER OWN HEART BEAT WORSE THAN IF SHE WERE BAKING THE MEN AS I SAID BEFORE
3105-163726-0056 FETCH DOWN THE STAVES OF THE RACK MY BOY WHAT WAS FARMER TO HAVE FOR SUPPER NAUGHT BUT AN ONION OR TWO AND A LOAF AND A RASHER OF RUSTY BACON THESE POOR DEVILS LIVE SO BADLY THEY ARE NOT WORTH ROBBING NO GAME
3105-163726-0057 THEN LET US HAVE A GAME OF LORIOT WITH THE BABY IT WILL BE THE BEST THING THAT COULD BEFALL A LUSTY INFANT HERETIC RIDE A COCK HORSE TO BANBURY CROSS BYE BYE BABY BUNTING TOSS HIM UP AND LET ME SEE IF MY WRIST BE STEADY
3105-163726-0058 THE CRUELTY OF THIS MAN IS A THING IT MAKES ME SICK TO SPEAK OF ENOUGH THAT WHEN THE POOR BABY FELL WITHOUT ATTEMPT AT CRY OR SCREAM THINKING IT PART OF HIS USUAL PLAY WHEN THEY TOSSED HIM UP TO COME DOWN AGAIN
3105-163726-0059 NOW I THINK THAT WHEN WE HEARD THIS STORY AND POOR KIT BADCOCK CAME ALL AROUND IN A SORT OF HALF CRAZY MANNER NOT LOOKING UP AT ANY ONE BUT DROPPING HIS EYES AND ASKING WHETHER WE THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN WELL TREATED AND SEEMING VOID OF REGARD FOR LIFE
3105-163726-0060 IF THIS WERE ALL THE STYLE OF IT THEN HAVING KNOWN HIM A LUSTY MAN AND A FINE SINGER IN AN ALE HOUSE
