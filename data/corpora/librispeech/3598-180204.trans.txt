3598-180204-0027 THAT'S JUST MY FEELING MISS MIDDLETON UNDERSTOOD THAT SOME ILLUSTRATION FROM THE CRICKETING FIELD WAS INTENDED TO THROW LIGHT ON THE BOY'S FEELING FOR MISTER WHITFORD YOUNG CROSSJAY WAS EVIDENTLY WARMING TO SPEAK FROM HIS HEART BUT THE SUN WAS LOW
3598-180204-0028 SHE HAD TO DRESS FOR THE DINNER TABLE AND SHE LANDED HIM WITH REGRET AS AT A HOLIDAY OVER BEFORE THEY PARTED HE OFFERED TO SWIM ACROSS THE LAKE IN HIS CLOTHES OR DIVE TO THE BED FOR ANYTHING SHE PLEASED TO THROW
3598-180204-0029 LIKE THE REED WARBLER ON THE BRANCH BESIDE THE NIGHT STREAM A SIMPLE SONG OF A LIGHTHEARTED SOUND INDEPENDENT OF THE SHIFTING BLACK AND GREY OF THE FLOOD UNDERNEATH A STEP WAS AT HER HEELS I SEE YOU HAVE BEEN PETTING MY SCAPEGRACE
3598-180204-0030 MISTER WHITFORD YES NOT PETTING I HOPE I TRIED TO GIVE HIM A LECTURE HE'S A DEAR LAD BUT I FANCY TRYING
3598-180204-0031 SHE HAD BEEN ROWING SHE SAID AND AS HE DIRECTED HIS EYES ACCORDING TO HIS WONT PENETRATINGLY SHE DEFENDED HERSELF BY FIXING HER MIND ON ROBINSON CRUSOE'S OLD GOAT IN THE RECESS OF THE CAVERN
3598-180204-0032 I MUST HAVE HIM AWAY FROM HERE VERY SOON SAID VERNON HERE HE'S QUITE SPOILED SPEAK OF HIM TO WILLOUGHBY I CAN'T GUESS AT HIS IDEAS OF THE BOY'S FUTURE BUT THE CHANCE OF PASSING FOR THE NAVY WON'T BEAR TRIFLING WITH
3598-180204-0033 AND IF EVER THERE WAS A LAD MADE FOR THE NAVY IT'S CROSSJAY THE INCIDENT OF THE EXPLOSION IN THE LABORATORY WAS NEW TO VERNON AND WILLOUGHBY LAUGHED HE SAID
3598-180204-0034 I WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD HIM UNDER ME UP TO THE LAST THREE MONTHS
3598-180204-0035 BUT HE'S RUINED HERE AND I AM GOING SO I SHALL NOT TROUBLE HIM FOR MANY WEEKS LONGER DOCTOR MIDDLETON IS WELL MY FATHER IS WELL YES HE POUNCED LIKE A FALCON ON YOUR NOTES IN THE LIBRARY
3598-180204-0036 I AM IN FOR A CONTROVERSY PAPA WILL NOT SPARE YOU TO JUDGE FROM HIS LOOK I KNOW THE LOOK HAVE YOU WALKED FAR TO DAY NINE AND A HALF HOURS MY FLIBBERTIGIBBET IS TOO MUCH FOR ME AT TIMES AND I HAD TO WALK OFF MY TEMPER
3598-180204-0037 SHE CAST HER EYES ON HIM THINKING OF THE PLEASURE OF DEALING WITH A TEMPER HONESTLY COLTISH AND MANFULLY OPEN TO A SPECIFIC ALL THOSE HOURS WERE REQUIRED NOT QUITE SO LONG YOU ARE TRAINING FOR YOUR ALPINE TOUR
3598-180204-0038 I LEAVE THE HALL AND SHALL PROBABLY BE IN LONDON WITH A PEN TO SELL WILLOUGHBY KNOWS THAT YOU LEAVE HIM AS MUCH AS MONT BLANC KNOWS THAT HE IS GOING TO BE CLIMBED BY A PARTY BELOW HE SEES A SPECK OR TWO IN THE VALLEY HE HAS NOT SPOKEN OF IT
3598-180204-0039 HE WOULD ATTRIBUTE IT TO CHANGES VERNON DID NOT CONCLUDE THE SENTENCE SHE BECAME BREATHLESS WITHOUT EMOTION BUT CHECKED BY THE BARRIER CONFRONTING AN IMPULSE TO ASK WHAT CHANGES SHE STOOPED TO PLUCK A COWSLIP
3598-180204-0040 I SAW DAFFODILS LOWER DOWN THE PARK SHE SAID ONE OR TWO THEY'RE NEARLY OVER WE ARE WELL OFF FOR WILD FLOWERS HERE HE ANSWERED DO NOT LEAVE HIM MISTER WHITFORD HE WILL NOT WANT ME YOU ARE DEVOTED TO HIM
3598-180204-0041 I CAN'T PRETEND THAT THEN IT IS THE CHANGES YOU IMAGINE YOU FORESEE IF ANY OCCUR WHY SHOULD THEY DRIVE YOU AWAY WELL I'M TWO AND THIRTY AND HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE FRAY A
3598-180204-0042 KIND OF NONDESCRIPT HALF SCHOLAR AND BY NATURE HALF BILLMAN OR BOWMAN OR MUSKETEER
3598-180204-0043 PAPA WILL NOT LIKE YOUR SERVING WITH YOUR PEN IN LONDON HE WILL SAY YOU ARE WORTH TOO MUCH FOR THAT GOOD MEN ARE AT IT I SHOULD NOT CARE TO BE RANKED ABOVE THEM THEY ARE WASTED HE SAYS ERROR
3598-180204-0044 IF THEY HAVE THEIR PRIVATE AMBITION THEY MAY SUPPOSE THEY ARE WASTED BUT THE VALUE TO THE WORLD OF A PRIVATE AMBITION I DO NOT CLEARLY UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE NOT AN EVIL OPINION OF THE WORLD SAID MISS MIDDLETON SICK AT HEART AS SHE SPOKE
3598-180204-0045 WITH THE SENSATION OF HAVING INVITED HERSELF TO TAKE A DROP OF POISON HE REPLIED ONE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE AN EVIL OPINION OF A RIVER HERE IT'S MUDDY THERE IT'S CLEAR ONE DAY TROUBLED ANOTHER AT REST
3598-180204-0046 WE HAVE TO TREAT IT WITH COMMON SENSE LOVE IT IN THE SENSE OF SERVING IT NOT THINK IT BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT IS PART OF IT THE REVERSE PAPA WOULD QUOTE THE MULIER FORMOSA
3598-180204-0047 EXCEPT THAT FISH IS TOO GOOD FOR THE BLACK EXTREMITY WOMAN IS EXCELLENT FOR THE UPPER HOW DO YOU SAY THAT NOT CYNICALLY I BELIEVE YOUR VIEW COMMENDS ITSELF TO MY REASON
3598-180204-0048 SHE WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR NOT STATING IT IN IDEAL CONTRAST WITH SIR WILLOUGHBY'S VIEW IF HE HAD SO INTENSELY DID HER YOUTHFUL BLOOD DESIRE TO BE ENAMOURED OF THE WORLD THAT SHE FELT HE WOULD HAVE LIFTED HER OFF HER FEET
3598-180204-0049 WHEN SHE SAID LOVE IT
3598-180204-0050 BUT THE SOBER IN THE SENSE OF SERVING IT ENTERED HER BRAIN AND WAS MATTER FOR REFLECTION UPON IT AND HIM SHE COULD THINK OF HIM IN PLEASANT LIBERTY UNCORRECTED BY HER WOMAN'S INSTINCT OF PERIL HE HAD NEITHER ARTS NOR GRACES
3598-180204-0051 NOTHING OF HIS COUSIN'S EASY SOCIAL FRONT FACE SHE HAD ONCE WITNESSED THE MILITARY PRECISION OF HIS DANCING AND HAD TO LEARN TO LIKE HIM BEFORE SHE CEASED TO PRAY THAT SHE MIGHT NEVER BE THE VICTIM OF IT AS HIS PARTNER
3598-180204-0052 HE WALKED HEROICALLY HIS PEDESTRIAN VIGOUR BEING FAMOUS BUT THAT MEANS ONE WHO WALKS AWAY FROM THE SEX NOT EXCELLING IN THE RECREATIONS WHERE MEN AND WOMEN JOIN HANDS HE WAS NOT MUCH OF A HORSEMAN EITHER SIR WILLOUGHBY ENJOYED SEEING HIM ON HORSEBACK
3598-180204-0053 AND HE COULD SCARCELY BE SAID TO SHINE IN A DRAWINGROOM UNLESS WHEN SEATED BESIDE A PERSON READY FOR REAL TALK EVEN MORE THAN HIS MERITS HIS DEMERITS POINTED HIM OUT AS A MAN TO BE A FRIEND TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WANTED ONE
3598-180204-0054 HIS WAY OF LIFE PICTURED TO HER TROUBLED SPIRIT AN ENVIABLE SMOOTHNESS AND HIS HAVING ACHIEVED THAT SMOOTH WAY SHE CONSIDERED A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND SHE WISHED TO LEAN IN IDEA UPON SOME FRIENDLY STRENGTH
3598-180204-0055 HIS REPUTATION FOR INDIFFERENCE TO THE FRIVOLOUS CHARMS OF GIRLS CLOTHED HIM WITH A NOBLE COLDNESS AND GAVE HIM THE DISTINCTION OF A FAR SEEN SOLITARY ICEBERG IN SOUTHERN WATERS THE POPULAR NOTION OF HEREDITARY TITLED ARISTOCRACY
3598-180204-0056 RESEMBLES HER SENTIMENT FOR A MAN THAT WOULD NOT FLATTER AND COULD NOT BE FLATTERED BY HER SEX HE APPEARED SUPERIOR ALMOST TO AWFULNESS SHE WAS YOUNG BUT SHE HAD RECEIVED MUCH FLATTERY IN HER EARS AND BY IT SHE HAD BEEN SNARED
3598-180204-0057 AND HE DISDAINING TO PRACTISE THE FOWLER'S ARTS OR TO CAST A THOUGHT ON SMALL FOWLS APPEARED TO HER TO HAVE A PRIDE FOUNDED ON NATURAL LOFTINESS THEY HAD NOT SPOKEN FOR AWHILE WHEN VERNON SAID ABRUPTLY
3598-180204-0058 THE BOY'S FUTURE RATHER DEPENDS ON YOU MISS MIDDLETON I MEAN TO LEAVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I DO NOT LIKE HIS BEING HERE WITHOUT ME THOUGH YOU WILL LOOK AFTER HIM I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT YOU MAY NOT AT FIRST SEE WHERE THE SPOILING HURTS HIM
3598-180204-0059 HE SHOULD BE PACKED OFF AT ONCE TO THE CRAMMER BEFORE YOU ARE LADY PATTERNE USE YOUR INFLUENCE WILLOUGHBY WILL SUPPORT THE LAD AT YOUR REQUEST THE COST CANNOT BE GREAT THERE ARE STRONG GROUNDS AGAINST MY HAVING HIM IN LONDON EVEN IF I COULD MANAGE IT MAY I COUNT ON YOU
3598-180204-0060 I WILL MENTION IT I WILL DO MY BEST SAID MISS MIDDLETON STRANGELY DEJECTED THEY WERE NOW ON THE LAWN WHERE SIR WILLOUGHBY WAS WALKING WITH THE LADIES ELEANOR AND ISABEL HIS MAIDEN AUNTS
3598-180204-0061 YOU SEEM TO HAVE COURSED THE HARE AND CAPTURED THE HART HE SAID TO HIS BRIDE STARTED THE TRUANT AND RUN DOWN THE PAEDAGOGUE SAID VERNON AY YOU WON'T LISTEN TO ME ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT BOY SIR WILLOUGHBY RETORTED THE LADIES EMBRACED MISS MIDDLETON
3598-180204-0062 ONE OFFERED UP AN EJACULATION IN EULOGY OF HER LOOKS THE OTHER OF HER HEALTHFULNESS THEN BOTH REMARKED THAT WITH INDULGENCE YOUNG CROSSJAY COULD BE INDUCED TO DO ANYTHING CLARA WONDERED WHETHER INCLINATION OR SIR WILLOUGHBY HAD DISCIPLINED THEIR INDIVIDUALITY OUT OF THEM
3598-180204-0063 AND MADE THEM HIS SHADOWS HIS ECHOES SHE GAZED FROM THEM TO HIM AND FEARED HIM BUT AS YET SHE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED THE POWER IN HIM WHICH COULD THREATEN AND WRESTLE TO SUBJECT THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD TO THE STATE OF SATELLITES
3598-180204-0064 THOUGH SHE HAD IN FACT BEEN GIVING BATTLE TO IT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS SHE HAD HELD HER OWN TOO WELL TO PERCEIVE DEFINITELY THE CHARACTER OF THE SPIRIT OPPOSING HER SHE SAID TO THE LADIES AH NO MISTER
3598-180204-0065 WHITFORD HAS CHOSEN THE ONLY METHOD FOR TEACHING A BOY LIKE CROSSJAY I PROPOSE TO MAKE A MAN OF HIM SAID SIR WILLOUGHBY WHAT IS TO BECOME OF HIM IF HE LEARNS NOTHING
3598-180204-0066 IF HE PLEASES ME HE WILL BE PROVIDED FOR I HAVE NEVER ABANDONED A DEPENDENT CLARA LET HER EYES REST ON HIS AND WITHOUT TURNING OR DROPPING
3598-180204-0067 HE WAS VERY SENSITIVE TO THE INTENTIONS OF EYES AND TONES WHICH WAS ONE SECRET OF HIS RIGID GRASP OF THE DWELLERS IN HIS HOUSEHOLD THEY WERE TAUGHT THAT THEY HAD TO RENDER AGREEMENT UNDER SHARP SCRUTINY
3598-180204-0068 STUDIOUS EYES DEVOID OF WARMTH DEVOID OF THE SHYNESS OF SEX THAT SUDDENLY CLOSED ON THEIR LOOK SIGNIFIED A WANT OF COMPREHENSION OF SOME KIND IT MIGHT BE HOSTILITY OF UNDERSTANDING WAS IT POSSIBLE HE DID NOT POSSESS HER UTTERLY
3598-180204-0069 HE FROWNED UP CLARA SAW THE LIFT OF HIS BROWS AND THOUGHT MY MIND IS MY OWN MARRIED OR NOT
