2581-155520-0000 MERLE SHIRLEY OVERACTS APPALLED I WONDERED WHO IT WAS WHO HAD TO COVER UP ONE CRIME COMMITTED ANOTHER WHO HAD STRUCK DOWN AN INNOCENT MAN TO SAVE A GUILTY NECK
2581-155520-0001 KENNEDY HURRIED TO THE SIDE OF THE PHYSICIAN AND I FOLLOWED
2581-155520-0002 HIS MOUTH SEEMED DRY AND I SHOULD SAY HE SUFFERED FROM A QUICK PROSTRATION THERE SEEMED TO BE A COMPLETE LOSS OF POWER TO SWALLOW OR SPEAK THE PUPILS WERE DILATED AS THOUGH FROM PARALYSIS OF THE EYES BOTH PHARYNX AND LARYNX WERE AFFECTED
2581-155520-0003 THERE WAS RESPIRATION PARALYSIS IT SEEMED ALSO AS THOUGH THE CRANIAL NERVES WERE PARTIALLY PARALYZED
2581-155520-0004 KENNEDY NODDED THAT FITS IN WITH A THEORY I HAVE I THOUGHT QUICKLY THEN INQUIRED COULD IT BE THE SNAKE VENOM AGAIN NO KENNEDY REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD
2581-155520-0005 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE SYMPTOMS AND THERE IS NO MARK ON ANY EXPOSED PART OF THE BODY AS NEAR AS I COULD SEE IN A SUPERFICIAL EXAMINATION HE TURNED TO THE PHYSICIAN COULD YOU GIVE ME BLOOD SMEARS AND SOME OF THE STOMACH CONTENTS AT ONCE
2581-155520-0006 TWICE NOW SOME ONE HAS BEEN STRICKEN DOWN BEFORE THE VERY EYES OF THE ACTORS THIS THING HAS GONE TOO FAR TO TRIFLE WITH OR DELAY A MOMENT THE DOCTOR HURRIED OFF TOWARD THE DRESSING ROOM ANXIOUS TO HELP KENNEDY
2581-155520-0007 AND AS EXCITED I THOUGHT AS ANY OF US NEXT KENNEDY FACED ME DID YOU WATCH THE PEOPLE AT ALL WALTER I I WAS TOO UPSET BY THE SUDDENNESS OF IT I STAMMERED
2581-155520-0008 ALL SEEMED TO HAVE SUSPICION OF SOME ONE ELSE AND THERE WAS A GENERAL CONSTRAINT AS THOUGH EVEN THE INNOCENT FEARED TO DO OR SAY SOMETHING THAT MIGHT LOOK OR SOUND INCRIMINATING I TURNED ALL WERE NOW WATCHING EVERY MOVE WE MADE
2581-155520-0009 THOUGH JUST YET NONE VENTURED TO FOLLOW US IT WAS AS THOUGH THEY FELT THAT TO DO SO WAS LIKE CROSSING A DEAD LINE I WONDERED WHICH ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE LOOKING AT US WITH INWARD TREPIDATION OR PERHAPS SATISFACTION IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY CHANCE TO REMOVE ANYTHING INCRIMINATING
2581-155520-0010 KENNEDY STRODE OVER TOWARD THE ILL FATED SET MACKAY AND I AT HIS HEELS AS WE MOVED ACROSS THE FLOOR I NOTICED THAT EVERYONE CLUSTERED AS CLOSE AS HE DARED AFRAID SEEMINGLY OF ANY ACTION WHICH MIGHT HINDER THE INVESTIGATION
2581-155520-0011 YET UNWILLING TO MISS ANY DETAIL OF KENNEDY'S METHOD IN CONTRAST WITH THE CLAMOR AND RACKET OF LESS THAN A HALF HOUR PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS NOW A DEATHLIKE STILLNESS BENEATH THE ARCHED GROUND GLASS ROOF THE HEAT WAS MORE OPPRESSIVE THAN EVER BEFORE
2581-155520-0012 IN THE FACES AND EXPRESSIONS OF THE AWED WITNESSES OF DEATH'S SWIFT HAND THERE WAS HORROR AND A GROWING FEAR NO ONE SPOKE EXCEPT IN WHISPERS WHEN ANYBODY MOVED IT WAS ON TIPTOE CAUTIOUSLY
2581-155520-0013 OF THE PEOPLE WE WISHED TO STUDY PHELPS CAUGHT OUR EYES THE FIRST DEJECTED CRUSHED UTTERLY DISCOURAGED HE WAS SLOUCHED DOWN IN A CHAIR JUST AT THE EDGE OF THE SUPPOSED BANQUET HALL I HAD NO DOUBT OF THE NATURE OF HIS THOUGHTS
2581-155520-0014 THERE WAS PROBABLY ONLY THE MOST PERFUNCTORY SYMPATHY FOR THE STRICKEN DIRECTOR WITHOUT QUESTION HIS MIND RAN TO DOLLARS THE DOLLAR ANGLE TO THIS TRAGEDY WAS THAT THE DEATH OF WERNER WAS SIMPLY ANOTHER STEP IN THE WRECKING OF MANTON PICTURES
2581-155520-0015 KENNEDY I SAW HARDLY GAVE HIM A PASSING GLANCE MANTON WE OBSERVED NEAR THE DOOR WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF MILLARD HE SEEMED ABOUT THE LEAST CONCERNED
2581-155520-0016 THE TWO SCENARIO WRITER AND PRODUCER HAD COUNTERFEITED THE MELODRAMA OF LIFE SO OFTEN IN THEIR PRODUCTIONS THAT EVEN THE SECOND SINISTER CHAPTER IN THIS FILM MYSTERY FAILED TO PENETRATE THEIR SANG FROID INWARDLY THEY MAY HAVE FELT AS DEEPLY AS ANY OF THE REST
2581-155520-0017 BUT BOTH MAINTAINED THEIR OUTWARD COMPOSURE ON MANTON'S SHOULDERS WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PICTURE I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS NERVOUS IRRITABLE YET AS VARIOUS EMPLOYEES APPROACHED FOR THEIR INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS EMERGENCY HE NEVER LOST HIS GRASP OF AFFAIRS
2581-155520-0018 IN THE VIBRANT QUIET OF THIS STUDIO CHAMBER STILL UNDER THE SHADOW OF TRAGEDY WE WITNESSED AS COLD BLOODED A BIT OF BUSINESS GENERALSHIP AS HAS EVER COME TO MY KNOWLEDGE WE OVERHEARD BECAUSE MANTON'S VOICE CARRIED ACROSS TO US IN THE STILLNESS
2581-155520-0019 KAUF THE NAME I REMEMBERED AS THAT OF THE TECHNICAL OR ART DIRECTOR UNDER WERNER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SETS OF THE BLACK TERROR YES MISTER MANTON KAUF WAS A SLIM STOOP SHOULDERED MAN
2581-155520-0020 YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE AND HOW THEY WORK AND YOU HAVE SETS LINED UP HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO FINISH THE DIRECTION BUT BUT
2581-155520-0021 DEAD HE STAMMERED OF COURSE MANTON'S VOICE ROSE SLIGHTLY IF WERNER WASN'T DEAD I WOULDN'T NEED ANOTHER DIRECTOR AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SOME ONE HAS TO COMPLETE THE BLACK TERROR
2581-155520-0022 GOOD I'LL DOUBLE YOUR SALARY INCLUDING ALL THIS WEEK
2581-155520-0023 TO NIGHT KAUF'S EYES WENT WIDE THEN HE STARTED TO FLUSH WELL TO MORROW THEN WE SIMPLY CAN'T LAY OFF A DAY KAUF ALL ALL RIGHT SIR
2581-155520-0024 LITERALLY ACTUALLY WERNER'S BODY COULD NOT BE COLD EVEN THE POLICE THE MEDICAL EXAMINER HAD NOT HAD SUFFICIENT TIME TO MAKE THE TRIP OUT FOR THEIR INVESTIGATION YET THE DIRECTOR'S SUCCESSOR HAD BEEN APPOINTED AND TOLD TO HURRY THE PRODUCTION
2581-155520-0025 I GLANCED AT PHELPS HE RAISED HIS HEAD SLOWLY HIS EXPRESSION LIFTING AT THE THOUGHT THAT PRODUCTION WAS TO CONTINUE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION IN ANOTHER MOMENT HOWEVER THERE WAS A CHANGE IN HIS FACE HIS EYES SOUGHT MANTON AND HARDENED HIS MOUTH TIGHTENED
2581-155520-0026 HATE A DEEP UNREASONING HATE SETTLED INTO HIS FEATURES KENNEDY PAUSING JUST LONG ENOUGH TO OBSERVE THE PROMOTER'S APPOINTMENT OF KAUF TO WERNER'S POSITION CONTINUED ON TOWARD THE SET
2581-155520-0027 NOW AS I LOOKED ABOUT I SAW THAT JACK GORDON WAS MISSING AS WELL AS MARILYN LORING PRESUMABLY THEY HAD GONE TO THEIR DRESSING ROOMS ALL THE OTHER ACTORS AND ACTRESSES WERE WAITING
2581-155520-0028 SUDDENLY KENNEDY STOPPED AND I GRASPED THAT IT WAS THE PECULIAR ACTIONS OF MERLE SHIRLEY WHICH HAD HALTED HIM THE HEAVY MAN WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE COMPANY ACTUALLY IN THE FABRICATED BANQUET HALL ITSELF
2581-155520-0029 CLINGING TO HIM STILL WERE THE GRIM FLOWING ROBES OF THE BLACK TERROR AS THOUGH HE WERE SOME OLD FASHIONED TRAGEDIAN HE WAS PACING UP AND DOWN HANDS BEHIND HIS BACK HEAD BOWED EYES ON THE FLOOR
2581-155520-0030 KENNEDY PUSHED FORWARD DID YOU LOSE SOMETHING MISTER SHIRLEY NO THE HEAVY MAN STRAIGHTENED AS HE DREW HIMSELF UP IN HIS SINISTER GARB I THOUGHT AGAIN OF THE CHEAP ACTORS OF A DAY WHEN MOVING PICTURES HAD YET TO PRE EMPT THE FIELD OF THE LURID MELODRAMA
2581-155520-0031 I HAVE KEPT A CAREFUL WATCH SO THAT NOTHING MIGHT BE DISTURBED DO YOU SUSPECT ANYONE KENNEDY ASKED SHIRLEY GLANCED AWAY AND WE KNEW HE WAS LYING NO NOT DEFINITELY WHO HAS BEEN IN THE SET SINCE I LEFT WITH THE DOCTOR
2581-155520-0032 SHIRLEY WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR NO ONE HAS HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY TO HIDE OR MOVE OR TAKE OR CHANGE A THING BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN RIGHT HERE ALL THE TIME I SEE THANKS AND
2581-155520-0033 KENNEDY SEEMED GENUINELY APOLOGETIC IF YOU DON'T MIND I WOULD PREFER TO MAKE MY INVESTIGATION ALONE SHIRLEY TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND MADE FOR HIS DRESSING ROOM
2581-155520-0034 I GATHERED FROM THE LOOK OF DISGUST ON MILLARD'S FACE THAT HE WANTED TO GET SHIRLEY OUT OF THE SET BEFORE KENNEDY SHOULD OBSERVE THE HEAVY MAN'S ODD REACTION TO THE TRAGEDY
2581-155520-0035 WHILE I HAD NEVER SEEN MILLARD AND SHIRLEY TOGETHER SO AS TO ESTABLISH IN MIND THE STATE OF THEIR FEELINGS TOWARD EACH OTHER THIS WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THEY WERE FRIENDLY CERTAINLY SHIRLEY WAS MAKING A FOOL OF HIMSELF ENID ACTED I GUESSED SO AS TO PREVENT MILLARD'S INTERFERENCE
2581-155520-0036 PROBABLY WITH THE IDEA THAT MILLARD IN SOME FASHION MIGHT BRING SUSPICION UPON HIMSELF IT STRUCK ME THAT ENID HAD A WHOLESOME RESPECT FOR KENNEDY AT ANY RATE MILLARD WATCHED THE LITTLE SCENE BETWEEN KENNEDY AND SHIRLEY WITH A QUIZZICAL EXPRESSION
2581-155520-0037 AS SHIRLEY LEFT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS THEN HE GAVE ENID'S CHEEKS A PLAYFUL PINCH EACH AND STARTED OUT AFTER THE HEAVY MAN IN LEISURELY FASHION JUST ABOUT THE SAME MOMENT KENNEDY CALLED ME TO HIS SIDE WALTER HE PLEADED IN A LOW VOICE
2581-155520-0038 WILL YOU HURRY OUT TO THE DRESSING ROOM WHERE THE DOCTOR AND I TOOK WERNER AND GET THE BLOOD SMEARS AND SAMPLE OF THE STOMACH CONTENTS I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS BECAUSE WE MUST WORK FAST AND GET ALL THE DATA WE NEED BEFORE THE POLICE ARRIVE
2581-155520-0039 WITH PERHAPS A HUNDRED PEOPLE TO QUESTION THEY'LL BE APT TO MAKE A FINE MESS OF EVERYTHING THIS IS AN OUTLYING PRECINCT WHERE WE'LL DRAW THE AMATEURS YOU KNOW
2581-155520-0040 THIS CORRIDOR WAS FAMILIAR HERE KENNEDY AND I HAD WAITED FOR MARILYN LORING AND HAD WITNESSED THE SCENE BETWEEN SHIRLEY AND HERSELF NOW I DID NOT EVEN REMEMBER THE LOCATION OF HER ROOM AT LAST ON A CHANCE I TRIED A DOOR SOFTLY
2581-155520-0041 FROM WITHIN CAME WHISPERED VOICES OF DEEP INTENSITY ABOUT TO CLOSE IT QUICKLY I REALIZED SUDDENLY THAT I RECOGNIZED THE SPEAKERS IN SPITE OF THE WHISPERS IT WAS MARILYN AND SHIRLEY THEY WERE TOGETHER
2581-155520-0042 NOW I RECOLLECTED THE FIGURED CHINTZ WHICH COVERED THE WALL AND WAS TO BE SEEN THROUGH THE CRACK MADE BY THE OPEN DOOR IT WAS HER ROOM THEY HAD NOT HEARD MY HAND ON THE KNOB NOR THE CATCH DID NOT KNOW THAT ANYONE COULD EAVESDROP
2581-155520-0043 I HAD TO NO I ADVISED YOU TO ACT AT ONCE I COULDN'T I CAN'T EVEN NOW ALL RIGHT HER TONE BECAME BITTER GO AHEAD YOUR OWN WAY BUT YOU MUST COUNT THE COST
2581-155520-0044 YOU MAY LOSE ME AGAIN MERLE SHIRLEY HOW DO YOU MEAN HER ANSWER IN THE FAINTEST OF WHISPERS STAGGERED ME
