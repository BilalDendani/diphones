1161-135206-0000 LOOK HERE BURGER SAID KENNEDY I DO WISH THAT YOU WOULD CONFIDE IN ME THE TWO FAMOUS STUDENTS OF ROMAN REMAINS SAT TOGETHER IN KENNEDY'S COMFORTABLE ROOM OVERLOOKING THE CORSO THE NIGHT WAS COLD
1161-135206-0001 AND THEY HAD BOTH PULLED UP THEIR CHAIRS TO THE UNSATISFACTORY ITALIAN STOVE WHICH THREW OUT A ZONE OF STUFFINESS RATHER THAN OF WARMTH OUTSIDE UNDER THE BRIGHT WINTER STARS LAY THE MODERN ROME THE LONG DOUBLE CHAIN OF THE ELECTRIC LAMPS
1161-135206-0002 THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED CAFES THE RUSHING CARRIAGES AND THE DENSE THRONG UPON THE FOOTPATHS BUT INSIDE IN THE SUMPTUOUS CHAMBER OF THE RICH YOUNG ENGLISH ARCHAEOLOGIST THERE WAS ONLY OLD ROME TO BE SEEN
1161-135206-0003 CRACKED AND TIMEWORN FRIEZES HUNG UPON THE WALLS GREY OLD BUSTS OF SENATORS AND SOLDIERS WITH THEIR FIGHTING HEADS AND THEIR HARD CRUEL FACES PEERED OUT FROM THE CORNERS ON THE CENTRE TABLE AMIDST A LITTER OF INSCRIPTIONS FRAGMENTS AND ORNAMENTS
1161-135206-0004 THERE STOOD THE FAMOUS RECONSTRUCTION BY KENNEDY OF THE BATHS OF CARACALLA
1161-135206-0005 AND A LITTER OF CURIOSITIES STREWED THE RICH RED TURKEY CARPET AND OF THEM ALL THERE WAS NOT ONE WHICH WAS NOT OF THE MOST UNIMPEACHABLE AUTHENTICITY AND OF THE UTMOST RARITY AND VALUE FOR KENNEDY THOUGH LITTLE MORE THAN THIRTY
1161-135206-0006 HAD A EUROPEAN REPUTATION IN THIS PARTICULAR BRANCH OF RESEARCH AND WAS MOREOVER PROVIDED WITH THAT LONG PURSE WHICH EITHER PROVES TO BE A FATAL HANDICAP TO THE STUDENT'S ENERGIES OR IF HIS MIND IS STILL TRUE TO ITS PURPOSE
1161-135206-0007 KENNEDY HAD OFTEN BEEN SEDUCED BY WHIM AND PLEASURE FROM HIS STUDIES BUT HIS MIND WAS AN INCISIVE ONE CAPABLE OF LONG AND CONCENTRATED EFFORTS WHICH ENDED IN SHARP REACTIONS OF SENSUOUS LANGUOR
1161-135206-0008 WAS A FAIR INDEX OF THE COMPROMISE BETWEEN STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IN HIS NATURE OF A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE WAS HIS COMPANION JULIUS BURGER HE CAME OF A CURIOUS BLEND
1161-135206-0009 WITH THE ROBUST QUALITIES OF THE NORTH MINGLING STRANGELY WITH THE SOFTER GRACES OF THE SOUTH BLUE TEUTONIC EYES LIGHTENED HIS SUN BROWNED FACE AND ABOVE THEM ROSE A SQUARE MASSIVE FOREHEAD WITH A FRINGE OF CLOSE YELLOW CURLS LYING ROUND IT
1161-135206-0010 HIS STRONG FIRM JAW WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HIS COMPANION HAD FREQUENTLY REMARKED HOW MUCH IT SUGGESTED
1161-135206-0011 UNDER ITS BLUFF GERMAN STRENGTH THERE LAY ALWAYS A SUGGESTION OF ITALIAN SUBTLETY BUT THE SMILE WAS SO HONEST AND THE EYES SO FRANK THAT ONE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS ONLY AN INDICATION OF HIS ANCESTRY WITH NO ACTUAL BEARING UPON HIS CHARACTER
1161-135206-0012 IN AGE AND IN REPUTATION HE WAS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS HIS ENGLISH COMPANION BUT HIS LIFE AND HIS WORK HAD BOTH BEEN FAR MORE ARDUOUS TWELVE YEARS BEFORE HE HAD COME AS A POOR STUDENT TO ROME
1161-135206-0013 AND HAD LIVED EVER SINCE UPON SOME SMALL ENDOWMENT FOR RESEARCH WHICH HAD BEEN AWARDED TO HIM BY THE UNIVERSITY OF BONN PAINFULLY SLOWLY AND DOGGEDLY
1161-135206-0014 TENACITY AND SINGLE MINDEDNESS HE HAD CLIMBED FROM RUNG TO RUNG OF THE LADDER OF FAME UNTIL NOW HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE BERLIN ACADEMY
1161-135206-0015 BUT THE SINGLENESS OF PURPOSE WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE SAME HIGH LEVEL AS THE RICH AND BRILLIANT ENGLISHMAN HAD CAUSED HIM IN EVERYTHING OUTSIDE THEIR WORK TO STAND INFINITELY BELOW HIM HE HAD NEVER FOUND A PAUSE IN HIS STUDIES
1161-135206-0016 TOO CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN LIMITATIONS IN LARGER SUBJECTS AND IMPATIENT OF THAT SMALL TALK WHICH IS THE CONVENTIONAL REFUGE OF THOSE WHO HAVE NO THOUGHTS TO EXPRESS
1161-135206-0017 WHICH APPEARED TO BE SLOWLY RIPENING INTO A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO VERY DIFFERENT RIVALS THE BASE AND ORIGIN OF THIS LAY IN THE FACT
1161-135206-0018 TO PROPERLY APPRECIATE THE OTHER THEIR COMMON INTERESTS AND PURSUITS HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AND EACH HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE OTHER'S KNOWLEDGE AND THEN GRADUALLY SOMETHING HAD BEEN ADDED TO THIS KENNEDY HAD BEEN AMUSED BY THE FRANKNESS AND SIMPLICITY OF HIS RIVAL
1161-135206-0019 WHILE BURGER IN TURN HAD BEEN FASCINATED BY THE BRILLIANCY AND VIVACITY WHICH HAD MADE KENNEDY SUCH A FAVOURITE IN ROMAN SOCIETY I SAY HAD BECAUSE JUST AT THE MOMENT THE YOUNG ENGLISHMAN WAS SOMEWHAT UNDER A CLOUD A LOVE AFFAIR
1161-135206-0020 THE DETAILS OF WHICH HAD NEVER QUITE COME OUT HAD INDICATED A HEARTLESSNESS AND CALLOUSNESS UPON HIS PART WHICH SHOCKED MANY OF HIS FRIENDS BUT IN THE BACHELOR CIRCLES OF STUDENTS AND ARTISTS IN WHICH HE PREFERRED TO MOVE THERE IS NO VERY RIGID CODE OF HONOUR IN SUCH MATTERS
1161-135206-0021 AND THOUGH A HEAD MIGHT BE SHAKEN OR A PAIR OF SHOULDERS SHRUGGED OVER THE FLIGHT OF TWO AND THE RETURN OF ONE THE GENERAL SENTIMENT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF CURIOSITY AND PERHAPS OF ENVY RATHER THAN OF REPROBATION
1161-135206-0022 LOOK HERE BURGER SAID KENNEDY LOOKING HARD AT THE PLACID FACE OF HIS COMPANION
1161-135206-0023 AS HE SPOKE HE WAVED HIS HAND IN THE DIRECTION OF A RUG WHICH LAY UPON THE FLOOR
1161-135206-0024 AND THIS WAS HEAPED WITH A LITTER OF OBJECTS INSCRIBED TILES BROKEN INSCRIPTIONS CRACKED MOSAICS
1161-135206-0025 RUSTY METAL ORNAMENTS WHICH TO THE UNINITIATED MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO HAVE COME STRAIGHT FROM A DUSTMAN'S BIN BUT WHICH A SPECIALIST WOULD HAVE SPEEDILY RECOGNIZED AS UNIQUE OF THEIR KIND THE PILE OF ODDS AND ENDS IN THE FLAT WICKER WORK BASKET
1161-135206-0026 SUPPLIED EXACTLY ONE OF THOSE MISSING LINKS OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH ARE OF SUCH INTEREST TO THE STUDENT IT WAS THE GERMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM IN AND THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES WERE HUNGRY AS HE LOOKED AT THEM I WON'T INTERFERE WITH YOUR TREASURE TROVE
1161-135206-0027 BUT I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IT HE CONTINUED WHILE BURGER VERY DELIBERATELY LIT A CIGAR IT IS EVIDENTLY A DISCOVERY OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE THESE INSCRIPTIONS WILL MAKE A SENSATION THROUGHOUT EUROPE FOR EVERY ONE
1161-135206-0028 THERE ARE SO MANY THAT A DOZEN SAVANTS MIGHT SPEND A LIFETIME OVER THEM AND BUILD UP A REPUTATION AS SOLID AS THE CASTLE OF SAINT ANGELO KENNEDY SAT THINKING WITH HIS FINE FOREHEAD WRINKLED AND HIS FINGERS PLAYING WITH HIS LONG FAIR MOUSTACHE
1161-135206-0029 YOU HAVE GIVEN YOURSELF AWAY BURGER SAID HE AT LAST YOUR WORDS CAN ONLY APPLY TO ONE THING YOU HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW CATACOMB I HAD NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAD ALREADY COME TO THAT CONCLUSION FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THESE OBJECTS WELL
1161-135206-0030 THEY CERTAINLY APPEARED TO INDICATE IT BUT YOUR LAST REMARKS MAKE IT CERTAIN THERE IS NO PLACE EXCEPT A CATACOMB WHICH COULD CONTAIN SO VAST A STORE OF RELICS AS YOU DESCRIBE QUITE SO THERE IS NO MYSTERY ABOUT THAT I HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW CATACOMB
1161-135206-0031 WHERE AH THAT IS MY SECRET MY DEAR KENNEDY SUFFICE IT
1161-135206-0032 THAT THERE IS NOT ONE CHANCE IN A MILLION OF ANYONE ELSE COMING UPON IT ITS DATE IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ANY KNOWN CATACOMB AND IT HAS BEEN RESERVED FOR THE BURIAL OF THE HIGHEST CHRISTIANS SO THAT THE REMAINS AND THE RELICS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING WHICH HAS EVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE
1161-135206-0033 IF I WAS NOT AWARE OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND OF YOUR ENERGY MY FRIEND I WOULD NOT HESITATE UNDER THE PLEDGE OF SECRECY TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
1161-135206-0034 OF THE MATTER BEFORE I EXPOSE MYSELF TO SUCH FORMIDABLE COMPETITION
1161-135206-0035 A LOVE WHICH HELD HIM TRUE TO IT AMIDST ALL THE DISTRACTIONS WHICH COME TO A WEALTHY AND DISSIPATED YOUNG MAN HE HAD AMBITION
1161-135206-0036 IN EVERYTHING WHICH CONCERNED THE OLD LIFE AND HISTORY OF THE CITY
1161-135206-0037 LOOK HERE BURGER SAID HE EARNESTLY
1161-135206-0038 NOTHING WOULD INDUCE ME TO PUT PEN TO PAPER ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH I SEE UNTIL I HAVE YOUR EXPRESS PERMISSION I QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELING AND I THINK IT IS MOST NATURAL BUT YOU HAVE REALLY NOTHING WHATEVER TO FEAR FROM ME
1161-135206-0039 ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DON'T TELL ME I SHALL MAKE A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH
1161-135206-0040 IN THAT CASE OF COURSE I SHOULD MAKE WHAT USE I LIKED OF IT
1161-135206-0041 BURGER SMILED THOUGHTFULLY OVER HIS CIGAR
1161-135206-0042 THAT WHEN I WANT INFORMATION OVER ANY POINT YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS SO READY TO SUPPLY IT
1161-135206-0043 YOU REMEMBER FOR EXAMPLE MY GIVING YOU THE MATERIAL FOR YOUR PAPER ABOUT THE TEMPLE OF THE VESTALS AH WELL
1161-135206-0044 WOULD YOU GIVE ME AN ANSWER I WONDER THIS NEW CATACOMB IS A VERY INTIMATE THING TO ME AND I SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPECT SOME SIGN OF CONFIDENCE IN RETURN
1161-135206-0045 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I WILL CERTAINLY DO SO WELL THEN SAID BURGER LEANING LUXURIOUSLY BACK IN HIS SETTEE AND PUFFING A BLUE TREE OF CIGAR SMOKE INTO THE AIR TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOUR RELATIONS WITH MISS MARY SAUNDERSON
1161-135206-0046 WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN HE CRIED WHAT SORT OF A QUESTION IS THIS YOU MAY MEAN IT AS A JOKE BUT YOU NEVER MADE A WORSE ONE NO I DON'T MEAN IT AS A JOKE SAID BURGER SIMPLY
1161-135206-0047 I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE WORLD AND WOMEN AND SOCIAL LIFE AND THAT SORT OF THING AND SUCH AN INCIDENT HAS THE FASCINATION OF THE UNKNOWN FOR ME I KNOW YOU AND I KNEW HER BY SIGHT
1161-135206-0048 I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOUR OWN LIPS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS WHICH OCCURRED BETWEEN YOU I WON'T TELL YOU A WORD THAT'S ALL RIGHT IT WAS ONLY MY WHIM TO SEE IF YOU WOULD GIVE UP A SECRET AS EASILY AS YOU EXPECTED ME TO GIVE UP MY SECRET OF THE NEW CATACOMB
1161-135206-0049 BUT WHY SHOULD YOU EXPECT OTHERWISE OF ME THERE'S SAINT JOHN'S CLOCK STRIKING TEN IT IS QUITE TIME THAT I WAS GOING HOME NO WAIT A BIT BURGER SAID KENNEDY
1161-135206-0050 WHICH HAS BURNED OUT MONTHS AGO YOU KNOW WE LOOK UPON A MAN WHO KISSES AND TELLS AS THE GREATEST COWARD AND VILLAIN POSSIBLE CERTAINLY SAID THE GERMAN GATHERING UP HIS BASKET OF CURIOSITIES WHEN HE TELLS ANYTHING ABOUT A GIRL WHICH IS PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN
1161-135206-0051 HE MUST BE SO BUT IN THIS CASE AS YOU MUST BE AWARE IT WAS A PUBLIC MATTER
1161-135206-0052 NO NO YOU HAVE REFUSED AND THERE IS AN END OF IT SAID BURGER WITH HIS BASKET ON HIS ARM NO DOUBT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT NOT TO ANSWER AND NO DOUBT I AM QUITE RIGHT ALSO AND SO AGAIN MY DEAR KENNEDY GOOD NIGHT THE ENGLISHMAN WATCHED BURGER CROSS THE ROOM
1161-135206-0053 HOLD ON OLD FELLOW SAID HE I THINK YOU ARE BEHAVING IN A MOST RIDICULOUS FASHION BUT STILL IF THIS IS YOUR CONDITION I SUPPOSE THAT I MUST SUBMIT TO IT I HATE SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT A GIRL
1161-135206-0054 WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED TO KNOW THE GERMAN CAME BACK TO THE STOVE AND LAYING DOWN HIS BASKET HE SANK INTO HIS CHAIR ONCE MORE MAY I HAVE ANOTHER CIGAR SAID HE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
1161-135206-0055 NOW AS REGARDS THIS YOUNG LADY WITH WHOM YOU HAD THIS LITTLE ADVENTURE
1161-135206-0056 SHE IS AT HOME WITH HER OWN PEOPLE OH REALLY IN ENGLAND YES WHAT PART OF ENGLAND LONDON NO TWICKENHAM YOU MUST EXCUSE MY CURIOSITY MY DEAR KENNEDY
1161-135206-0057 AND YOU MUST PUT IT DOWN TO MY IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD NO DOUBT IT IS QUITE A SIMPLE THING TO PERSUADE A YOUNG LADY TO GO OFF WITH YOU FOR THREE WEEKS OR SO AND THEN TO HAND HER OVER TO HER OWN FAMILY AT WHAT DID YOU CALL THE PLACE TWICKENHAM
1161-135206-0058 THAT I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE HOW YOU SET ABOUT IT FOR EXAMPLE
1161-135206-0059 SO I PRESUME THAT YOU COULD NOT HAVE LOVED HER AT ALL BUT IF YOU DID NOT LOVE HER WHY SHOULD YOU MAKE THIS GREAT SCANDAL WHICH HAS DAMAGED YOU AND RUINED HER
1161-135206-0060 LOVE IS A BIG WORD
1161-135206-0061 I LIKED HER AND WELL YOU SAY YOU'VE SEEN HER YOU KNOW HOW CHARMING SHE COULD LOOK BUT STILL I AM WILLING TO ADMIT LOOKING BACK THAT I COULD NEVER HAVE REALLY LOVED HER THEN MY DEAR KENNEDY WHY DID YOU DO IT THE ADVENTURE OF THE THING HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH IT
1161-135206-0062 WHAT YOU ARE SO FOND OF ADVENTURES WHERE WOULD THE VARIETY OF LIFE BE WITHOUT THEM
1161-135206-0063 I'VE CHASED A GOOD DEAL OF GAME IN MY TIME BUT THERE'S NO CHASE LIKE THAT OF A PRETTY WOMAN THERE WAS THE PIQUANT DIFFICULTY OF IT ALSO FOR AS SHE WAS THE COMPANION OF LADY EMILY ROOD IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HER ALONE
1161-135206-0064 ON THE TOP OF ALL THE OTHER OBSTACLES WHICH ATTRACTED ME I LEARNED FROM HER OWN LIPS VERY EARLY IN THE PROCEEDINGS THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED
1161-135206-0065 SHE MENTIONED NO NAMES
1161-135206-0066 SO THAT MADE THE ADVENTURE MORE ALLURING DID IT WELL IT DID CERTAINLY GIVE A SPICE TO IT DON'T YOU THINK SO I TELL YOU THAT I AM VERY IGNORANT ABOUT THESE THINGS MY DEAR FELLOW
1161-135206-0067 YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT THE APPLE YOU STOLE FROM YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S TREE WAS ALWAYS SWEETER THAN THAT WHICH FELL FROM YOUR OWN AND THEN I FOUND THAT SHE CARED FOR ME
1161-135206-0068 BUT AT LAST I WON HER OVER SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT MY JUDICIAL SEPARATION FROM MY WIFE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY HER BUT SHE CAME ALL THE SAME AND WE HAD A DELIGHTFUL TIME AS LONG AS IT LASTED BUT HOW ABOUT THE OTHER MAN
1161-135206-0069 KENNEDY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I SUPPOSE IT IS THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST SAID HE IF HE HAD BEEN THE BETTER MAN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DESERTED HIM
1161-135206-0070 ONLY ONE OTHER THING HOW DID YOU GET RID OF HER IN THREE WEEKS
1161-135206-0071 NOW OF COURSE ROME IS NECESSARY TO ME
1161-135206-0072 THEN AGAIN HER OLD FATHER TURNED UP AT THE HOTEL IN LONDON AND THERE WAS A SCENE AND THE WHOLE THING BECAME SO UNPLEASANT THAT REALLY THOUGH I MISSED HER DREADFULLY AT FIRST I WAS VERY GLAD TO SLIP OUT OF IT
1161-135206-0073 MY DEAR KENNEDY I SHOULD NOT DREAM OF REPEATING IT BUT ALL THAT YOU SAY INTERESTS ME VERY MUCH
1161-135206-0074 FOR I HAVE SEEN SO LITTLE OF LIFE AND NOW YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MY NEW CATACOMB THERE'S NO USE MY TRYING TO DESCRIBE IT
1161-135206-0075 AND THAT IS FOR ME TO TAKE YOU THERE THAT WOULD BE SPLENDID WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME THE SOONER THE BETTER I AM ALL IMPATIENCE TO SEE IT
1161-135206-0076 SUPPOSE WE START IN AN HOUR WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL TO KEEP THE MATTER TO OURSELVES
1161-135206-0077 IS IT FAR SOME MILES NOT TOO FAR TO WALK OH NO WE COULD WALK THERE EASILY WE HAD BETTER DO SO THEN
1161-135206-0078 QUITE SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST FOR US TO MEET AT THE GATE OF THE APPIAN WAY AT MIDNIGHT I MUST GO BACK TO MY LODGINGS FOR THE MATCHES AND CANDLES AND THINGS ALL RIGHT BURGER
1161-135206-0079 THE COLD CLEAR AIR WAS FILLED WITH THE MUSICAL CHIMES FROM THAT CITY OF CLOCKS AS BURGER WRAPPED IN AN ITALIAN OVERCOAT WITH A LANTERN HANGING FROM HIS HAND WALKED UP TO THE RENDEZVOUS KENNEDY STEPPED OUT OF THE SHADOW TO MEET HIM
1161-135206-0080 YOU ARE ARDENT IN WORK AS WELL AS IN LOVE SAID THE GERMAN LAUGHING
1161-135206-0081 I HOPE YOU LEFT NO CLUE AS TO WHERE WE WERE GOING NOT SUCH A FOOL BY JOVE
1161-135206-0082 THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOUNDED LOUD AND CRISP UPON THE ROUGH STONE PAVING OF THE DISAPPOINTING ROAD WHICH IS ALL THAT IS LEFT OF THE MOST FAMOUS HIGHWAY OF THE WORLD A PEASANT OR TWO GOING HOME FROM THE WINE SHOP AND A FEW CARTS OF COUNTRY PRODUCE COMING UP TO ROME
1161-135206-0083 WERE THE ONLY THINGS WHICH THEY MET
1161-135206-0084 AND SAW AGAINST A RISING MOON THE GREAT CIRCULAR BASTION OF CECILIA METELLA IN FRONT OF THEM THEN BURGER STOPPED WITH HIS HAND TO HIS SIDE YOUR LEGS ARE LONGER THAN MINE AND YOU ARE MORE ACCUSTOMED TO WALKING SAID HE LAUGHING
1161-135206-0085 I THINK THAT THE PLACE WHERE WE TURN OFF IS SOMEWHERE HERE YES THIS IS IT ROUND THE CORNER OF THE TRATTORIA
1161-135206-0086 HE HAD LIT HIS LANTERN
1161-135206-0087 WHICH WOUND ACROSS THE MARSHES OF THE CAMPAGNA THE GREAT AQUEDUCT OF OLD ROME LAY LIKE A MONSTROUS CATERPILLAR ACROSS THE MOONLIT LANDSCAPE AND THEIR ROAD LED THEM UNDER ONE OF ITS HUGE ARCHES AND PAST THE CIRCLE OF CRUMBLING BRICKS WHICH MARKS THE OLD ARENA
1161-135206-0088 AT LAST BURGER STOPPED AT A SOLITARY WOODEN COW HOUSE AND HE DREW A KEY FROM HIS POCKET SURELY YOUR CATACOMB IS NOT INSIDE A HOUSE CRIED KENNEDY THE ENTRANCE TO IT IS
1161-135206-0089 DOES THE PROPRIETOR KNOW OF IT NOT HE HE HAD FOUND ONE OR TWO OBJECTS WHICH MADE ME ALMOST CERTAIN THAT HIS HOUSE WAS BUILT ON THE ENTRANCE TO SUCH A PLACE SO I RENTED IT FROM HIM AND DID MY EXCAVATIONS FOR MYSELF COME IN AND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND YOU
1161-135206-0090 IT WAS A LONG EMPTY BUILDING
1161-135206-0091 BURGER PUT HIS LANTERN DOWN ON THE GROUND AND SHADED ITS LIGHT IN ALL DIRECTIONS SAVE ONE BY DRAPING HIS OVERCOAT ROUND IT IT MIGHT EXCITE REMARK IF ANYONE SAW A LIGHT IN THIS LONELY PLACE SAID HE JUST HELP ME TO MOVE THIS BOARDING THE FLOORING WAS LOOSE IN THE CORNER
1161-135206-0092 AND PLANK BY PLANK THE TWO SAVANTS RAISED IT AND LEANED IT AGAINST THE WALL BELOW THERE WAS A SQUARE APERTURE AND A STAIR OF OLD STONE STEPS WHICH LED AWAY DOWN INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH BE CAREFUL CRIED BURGER
1161-135206-0093 AND IF YOU WERE ONCE TO LOSE YOUR WAY THERE THE CHANCES WOULD BE A HUNDRED TO ONE AGAINST YOUR EVER COMING OUT AGAIN WAIT UNTIL I BRING THE LIGHT HOW DO YOU FIND YOUR OWN WAY IF IT IS SO COMPLICATED I HAD SOME VERY NARROW ESCAPES AT FIRST
1161-135206-0094 BUT I HAVE GRADUALLY LEARNED TO GO ABOUT THERE IS A CERTAIN SYSTEM TO IT BUT IT IS ONE WHICH A LOST MAN IF HE WERE IN THE DARK COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND OUT
1161-135206-0095 YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT IT IS DIFFICULT
1161-135206-0096 DIVIDES AND SUBDIVIDES A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE YOU GO A HUNDRED YARDS THEY HAD DESCENDED SOME TWENTY FEET FROM THE LEVEL OF THE BYRE
1161-135206-0097 THE LANTERN CAST A FLICKERING LIGHT
1161-135206-0098 OVER THE CRACKED BROWN WALLS IN EVERY DIRECTION WERE THE BLACK OPENINGS OF PASSAGES WHICH RADIATED FROM THIS COMMON CENTRE I WANT YOU TO FOLLOW ME CLOSELY MY FRIEND SAID BURGER DO NOT LOITER
1161-135206-0099 TO LOOK AT ANYTHING UPON THE WAY FOR THE PLACE TO WHICH I WILL TAKE YOU CONTAINS ALL THAT YOU CAN SEE AND MORE IT WILL SAVE TIME FOR US TO GO THERE DIRECT
1161-135206-0100 EVERY NOW AND THEN THE PASSAGE BIFURCATED BUT BURGER WAS EVIDENTLY FOLLOWING SOME SECRET MARKS OF HIS OWN FOR HE NEITHER STOPPED NOR HESITATED EVERYWHERE ALONG THE WALLS PACKED LIKE THE BERTHS UPON AN EMIGRANT SHIP LAY THE CHRISTIANS OF OLD ROME
1161-135206-0101 THE YELLOW LIGHT FLICKERED OVER THE SHRIVELLED FEATURES OF THE MUMMIES AND GLEAMED UPON ROUNDED SKULLS AND LONG WHITE ARMBONES CROSSED OVER FLESHLESS CHESTS AND EVERYWHERE AS HE PASSED KENNEDY LOOKED WITH WISTFUL EYES
1161-135206-0102 UPON INSCRIPTIONS FUNERAL VESSELS PICTURES VESTMENTS UTENSILS ALL LYING AS PIOUS HANDS HAD PLACED THEM SO MANY CENTURIES AGO IT WAS APPARENT TO HIM
1161-135206-0103 CONTAINING SUCH A STOREHOUSE OF ROMAN REMAINS AS HAD NEVER BEFORE COME AT ONE TIME UNDER THE OBSERVATION OF THE STUDENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE LIGHT WENT OUT HE ASKED AS THEY HURRIED ONWARDS
1161-135206-0104 BY THE WAY KENNEDY HAVE YOU ANY MATCHES
1161-135206-0105 MORE THAN THAT I THINK THERE IS REALLY NO LIMIT TO THE TOMBS AT LEAST
1161-135206-0106 THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT PLACE SO I THINK THAT I WILL USE OUR BALL OF STRING
1161-135206-0107 PAYING IT OUT AS HE ADVANCED
1161-135206-0108 WITH A PERFECT NETWORK OF INTERSECTING CORRIDORS BUT THESE ALL ENDED IN ONE LARGE CIRCULAR HALL WITH A SQUARE PEDESTAL OF TUFA TOPPED WITH A SLAB OF MARBLE AT ONE END OF IT BY JOVE CRIED KENNEDY IN AN ECSTASY AS BURGER SWUNG HIS LANTERN OVER THE MARBLE
1161-135206-0109 IT IS A CHRISTIAN ALTAR PROBABLY THE FIRST ONE IN EXISTENCE HERE IS THE LITTLE CONSECRATION CROSS CUT UPON THE CORNER OF IT NO DOUBT THIS CIRCULAR SPACE WAS USED AS A CHURCH
1161-135206-0110 FOR THEY ARE THE EARLY POPES AND BISHOPS OF THE CHURCH WITH THEIR MITRES THEIR CROZIERS AND FULL CANONICALS
1161-135206-0111 KENNEDY WENT ACROSS AND STARED AT THE GHASTLY HEAD WHICH LAY LOOSELY ON THE SHREDDED AND MOULDERING MITRE THIS IS MOST INTERESTING SAID HE AND HIS VOICE SEEMED TO BOOM AGAINST THE CONCAVE VAULT AS FAR AS MY EXPERIENCE GOES IT IS UNIQUE
1161-135206-0112 BUT THE GERMAN HAD STROLLED AWAY AND WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A YELLOW CIRCLE OF LIGHT AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY WRONG TURNINGS THERE ARE BETWEEN THIS AND THE STAIRS HE ASKED THERE ARE OVER TWO THOUSAND
1161-135206-0113 NO DOUBT IT WAS ONE OF THE MEANS OF PROTECTION WHICH THE CHRISTIANS ADOPTED THE ODDS ARE TWO THOUSAND TO ONE AGAINST A MAN GETTING OUT EVEN IF HE HAD A LIGHT BUT IF HE WERE IN THE DARK IT WOULD OF COURSE BE FAR MORE DIFFICULT SO I SHOULD THINK
1161-135206-0114 AND THE DARKNESS IS SOMETHING DREADFUL I TRIED IT ONCE FOR AN EXPERIMENT LET US TRY IT AGAIN
1161-135206-0115 IT WAS AS IF AN INVISIBLE HAND WAS SQUEEZED TIGHTLY OVER EACH OF KENNEDY'S EYES NEVER HAD HE KNOWN WHAT SUCH DARKNESS WAS IT SEEMED TO PRESS UPON HIM AND TO SMOTHER HIM IT WAS A SOLID OBSTACLE AGAINST WHICH THE BODY SHRANK FROM ADVANCING
1161-135206-0116 HE PUT HIS HANDS OUT TO PUSH IT BACK FROM HIM THAT WILL DO BURGER SAID HE LET'S HAVE THE LIGHT AGAIN BUT HIS COMPANION BEGAN TO LAUGH AND IN THAT CIRCULAR ROOM THE SOUND SEEMED TO COME FROM EVERY SIDE AT ONCE
1161-135206-0117 YOU SEEM UNEASY FRIEND KENNEDY SAID HE GO ON MAN LIGHT THE CANDLE SAID KENNEDY IMPATIENTLY IT'S VERY STRANGE KENNEDY BUT I COULD NOT IN THE LEAST TELL BY THE SOUND IN WHICH DIRECTION YOU STAND COULD YOU TELL WHERE I AM NO YOU SEEM TO BE ON EVERY SIDE OF ME
1161-135206-0118 WELL KENNEDY THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHICH I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE VERY FOND OF THE ONE IS AN ADVENTURE AND THE OTHER IS AN OBSTACLE TO SURMOUNT THE ADVENTURE MUST BE THE FINDING OF YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS CATACOMB
1161-135206-0119 THE OBSTACLE WILL BE THE DARKNESS AND THE TWO THOUSAND WRONG TURNS
1161-135206-0120 BUT YOU NEED NOT HURRY FOR YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME AND WHEN YOU HALT FOR A REST NOW AND THEN I SHOULD LIKE YOU JUST TO THINK OF MISS MARY SAUNDERSON AND WHETHER YOU TREATED HER QUITE FAIRLY
1161-135206-0121 HE WAS RUNNING ABOUT IN LITTLE CIRCLES AND CLASPING AT THE SOLID BLACKNESS WITH BOTH HANDS GOOD BYE
1161-135206-0122 I REALLY DO NOT THINK KENNEDY EVEN BY YOUR OWN SHOWING THAT YOU DID THE RIGHT THING BY THAT GIRL
1161-135206-0123 AND I CAN SUPPLY IT MISS SAUNDERSON WAS ENGAGED TO A POOR UNGAINLY DEVIL OF A STUDENT AND HIS NAME WAS JULIUS BURGER THERE WAS A RUSTLE SOMEWHERE THE VAGUE SOUND OF A FOOT STRIKING A STONE
1161-135206-0124 AND THEN THERE FELL SILENCE UPON THAT OLD CHRISTIAN CHURCH A STAGNANT HEAVY SILENCE WHICH CLOSED ROUND KENNEDY AND SHUT HIM IN LIKE WATER ROUND A DROWNING MAN SOME TWO MONTHS AFTERWARDS
1161-135206-0125 THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH MADE THE ROUND OF THE EUROPEAN PRESS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING DISCOVERIES OF RECENT YEARS IS THAT OF THE NEW CATACOMB IN ROME WHICH LIES SOME DISTANCE TO THE EAST OF THE WELL KNOWN VAULTS OF SAINT CALIXTUS
1161-135206-0126 IS DUE TO THE ENERGY AND SAGACITY OF DOCTOR JULIUS BURGER THE YOUNG GERMAN SPECIALIST WHO IS RAPIDLY TAKING THE FIRST PLACE AS AN AUTHORITY UPON ANCIENT ROME ALTHOUGH THE FIRST TO PUBLISH HIS DISCOVERY
1161-135206-0127 IT APPEARS THAT A LESS FORTUNATE ADVENTURER HAD ANTICIPATED DOCTOR BURGER SOME MONTHS AGO MISTER KENNEDY THE WELL KNOWN ENGLISH STUDENT DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY FROM HIS ROOMS IN THE CORSO AND IT WAS CONJECTURED THAT HIS ASSOCIATION WITH A RECENT SCANDAL
1161-135206-0128 HAD DRIVEN HIM TO LEAVE ROME IT APPEARS NOW THAT HE HAD IN REALITY FALLEN A VICTIM TO THAT FERVID LOVE OF ARCHAEOLOGY WHICH HAD RAISED HIM TO A DISTINGUISHED PLACE AMONG LIVING SCHOLARS HIS BODY WAS DISCOVERED IN THE HEART OF THE NEW CATACOMB
1161-135206-0129 WHICH MAKE THESE SUBTERRANEAN TOMBS SO DANGEROUS TO EXPLORERS THE DECEASED GENTLEMAN HAD WITH INEXPLICABLE RASHNESS MADE HIS WAY INTO THIS LABYRINTH WITHOUT AS FAR AS CAN BE DISCOVERED TAKING WITH HIM EITHER CANDLES OR MATCHES
1161-135206-0130 SO THAT HIS SAD FATE WAS THE NATURAL RESULT OF HIS OWN TEMERITY
