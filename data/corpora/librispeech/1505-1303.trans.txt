1505-1303-0000 STUDY IN SCARLET
1505-1303-0001 BEING A REPRINT FROM THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN H WATSON M D
1505-1303-0002 IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I TOOK MY DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF MEDICINE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND PROCEEDED TO NETLEY TO GO THROUGH THE COURSE PRESCRIBED FOR SURGEONS IN THE ARMY
1505-1303-0003 HAVING COMPLETED MY STUDIES THERE I WAS DULY ATTACHED TO THE FIFTH NORTHUMBERLAND FUSILIERS AS ASSISTANT SURGEON THE REGIMENT WAS STATIONED IN INDIA AT THE TIME AND BEFORE I COULD JOIN IT
1505-1303-0004 THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR HAD BROKEN OUT ON LANDING AT BOMBAY I LEARNED THAT MY CORPS HAD ADVANCED THROUGH THE PASSES AND WAS ALREADY DEEP IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY I FOLLOWED HOWEVER
1505-1303-0005 WITH MANY OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS MYSELF AND SUCCEEDED IN REACHING CANDAHAR IN SAFETY WHERE I FOUND MY REGIMENT AND AT ONCE ENTERED UPON MY NEW DUTIES
1505-1303-0006 THE CAMPAIGN BROUGHT HONOURS AND PROMOTION TO MANY BUT FOR ME IT HAD NOTHING BUT MISFORTUNE AND DISASTER I WAS REMOVED FROM MY BRIGADE
1505-1303-0007 WITH WHOM I SERVED AT THE FATAL BATTLE OF MAIWAND THERE I WAS STRUCK ON THE SHOULDER
1505-1303-0008 WHICH SHATTERED THE BONE AND GRAZED THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE MURDEROUS GHAZIS HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DEVOTION AND COURAGE SHOWN BY MURRAY MY ORDERLY WHO THREW ME ACROSS A PACK HORSE
1505-1303-0009 AND SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING ME SAFELY TO THE BRITISH LINES WORN WITH PAIN AND WEAK FROM THE PROLONGED HARDSHIPS WHICH I HAD UNDERGONE I WAS REMOVED WITH A GREAT TRAIN OF WOUNDED SUFFERERS TO THE BASE HOSPITAL AT PESHAWAR
1505-1303-0010 HERE I RALLIED AND HAD ALREADY IMPROVED SO FAR AS TO BE ABLE TO WALK ABOUT THE WARDS AND EVEN TO BASK A LITTLE UPON THE VERANDAH WHEN I WAS STRUCK DOWN BY ENTERIC FEVER THAT CURSE OF OUR INDIAN POSSESSIONS
1505-1303-0011 AND WHEN AT LAST I CAME TO MYSELF AND BECAME CONVALESCENT I WAS SO WEAK AND EMACIATED THAT A MEDICAL BOARD DETERMINED THAT NOT A DAY SHOULD BE LOST IN SENDING ME BACK TO ENGLAND I WAS DISPATCHED ACCORDINGLY
1505-1303-0012 IN THE TROOPSHIP ORONTES AND LANDED A MONTH LATER ON PORTSMOUTH JETTY WITH MY HEALTH IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED BUT WITH PERMISSION FROM A PATERNAL GOVERNMENT TO SPEND THE NEXT NINE MONTHS IN ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE IT
1505-1303-0013 I HAD NEITHER KITH NOR KIN IN ENGLAND AND WAS THEREFORE AS FREE AS AIR OR AS FREE AS AN INCOME OF ELEVEN SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE A DAY WILL PERMIT A MAN TO BE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I NATURALLY GRAVITATED TO LONDON
1505-1303-0014 THAT GREAT CESSPOOL INTO WHICH ALL THE LOUNGERS AND IDLERS OF THE EMPIRE ARE IRRESISTIBLY DRAINED THERE I STAYED FOR SOME TIME AT A PRIVATE HOTEL IN THE STRAND LEADING A COMFORTLESS MEANINGLESS EXISTENCE
1505-1303-0015 AND SPENDING SUCH MONEY AS I HAD CONSIDERABLY MORE FREELY THAN I OUGHT SO ALARMING DID THE STATE OF MY FINANCES BECOME THAT I SOON REALIZED THAT I MUST EITHER LEAVE THE METROPOLIS AND RUSTICATE SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY
1505-1303-0016 OR THAT I MUST MAKE A COMPLETE ALTERATION IN MY STYLE OF LIVING CHOOSING THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE I BEGAN BY MAKING UP MY MIND TO LEAVE THE HOTEL
1505-1303-0017 AND TO TAKE UP MY QUARTERS IN SOME LESS PRETENTIOUS AND LESS EXPENSIVE DOMICILE ON THE VERY DAY THAT I HAD COME TO THIS CONCLUSION I WAS STANDING AT THE CRITERION BAR WHEN SOME ONE TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER
1505-1303-0018 AND TURNING ROUND I RECOGNIZED YOUNG STAMFORD WHO HAD BEEN A DRESSER UNDER ME AT BARTS THE SIGHT OF A FRIENDLY FACE IN THE GREAT WILDERNESS OF LONDON IS A PLEASANT THING INDEED TO A LONELY MAN IN OLD DAYS
1505-1303-0019 STAMFORD HAD NEVER BEEN A PARTICULAR CRONY OF MINE BUT NOW I HAILED HIM WITH ENTHUSIASM AND HE IN HIS TURN APPEARED TO BE DELIGHTED TO SEE ME IN THE EXUBERANCE OF MY JOY I ASKED HIM TO LUNCH WITH ME AT THE HOLBORN
1505-1303-0020 AND WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER IN A HANSOM WHATEVER HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF WATSON HE ASKED IN UNDISGUISED WONDER AS WE RATTLED THROUGH THE CROWDED LONDON STREETS
1505-1303-0021 I GAVE HIM A SHORT SKETCH OF MY ADVENTURES AND HAD HARDLY CONCLUDED IT BY THE TIME THAT WE REACHED OUR DESTINATION POOR DEVIL HE SAID COMMISERATINGLY AFTER HE HAD LISTENED TO MY MISFORTUNES
1505-1303-0022 THAT'S A STRANGE THING REMARKED MY COMPANION YOU ARE THE SECOND MAN TO DAY THAT HAS USED THAT EXPRESSION TO ME AND WHO WAS THE FIRST
1505-1303-0023 AND WHICH WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSE BY JOVE I CRIED IF HE REALLY WANTS SOMEONE TO SHARE THE ROOMS AND THE EXPENSE I AM THE VERY MAN FOR HIM I SHOULD PREFER HAVING A PARTNER TO BEING ALONE
1505-1303-0024 YOUNG STAMFORD LOOKED RATHER STRANGELY AT ME OVER HIS WINE GLASS
1505-1303-0025 PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT CARE FOR HIM AS A CONSTANT COMPANION WHY WHAT IS THERE AGAINST HIM
1505-1303-0026 HE IS A LITTLE QUEER IN HIS IDEAS AN ENTHUSIAST IN SOME BRANCHES OF SCIENCE AS FAR AS I KNOW HE IS A DECENT FELLOW ENOUGH A MEDICAL STUDENT I SUPPOSE SAID I NO
1505-1303-0027 I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE INTENDS TO GO IN FOR I BELIEVE HE IS WELL UP IN ANATOMY AND HE IS A FIRST CLASS CHEMIST BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW HE HAS NEVER TAKEN OUT ANY SYSTEMATIC MEDICAL CLASSES
1505-1303-0028 HIS STUDIES ARE VERY DESULTORY AND ECCENTRIC BUT HE HAS AMASSED A LOT OF OUT OF THE WAY KNOWLEDGE WHICH WOULD ASTONISH HIS PROFESSORS DID YOU NEVER ASK HIM WHAT HE WAS GOING IN FOR I ASKED NO
1505-1303-0029 THOUGH HE CAN BE COMMUNICATIVE ENOUGH WHEN THE FANCY SEIZES HIM I SHOULD LIKE TO MEET HIM I SAID IF I AM TO LODGE WITH ANYONE I SHOULD PREFER A MAN OF STUDIOUS AND QUIET HABITS
1505-1303-0030 I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH YET TO STAND MUCH NOISE OR EXCITEMENT I HAD ENOUGH OF BOTH IN AFGHANISTAN TO LAST ME FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY NATURAL EXISTENCE HOW COULD I MEET THIS FRIEND OF YOURS
1505-1303-0031 RETURNED MY COMPANION HE EITHER AVOIDS THE PLACE FOR WEEKS OR ELSE HE WORKS THERE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
1505-1303-0032 WE SHALL DRIVE ROUND TOGETHER AFTER LUNCHEON CERTAINLY I ANSWERED AND THE CONVERSATION DRIFTED AWAY INTO OTHER CHANNELS AS WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER LEAVING THE HOLBORN
1505-1303-0033 STAMFORD GAVE ME A FEW MORE PARTICULARS ABOUT THE GENTLEMAN WHOM I PROPOSED TO TAKE AS A FELLOW LODGER YOU MUSTN'T BLAME ME IF YOU DON'T GET ON WITH HIM HE SAID
1505-1303-0034 YOU PROPOSED THIS ARRANGEMENT SO YOU MUST NOT HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE IF WE DON'T GET ON IT WILL BE EASY TO PART COMPANY I ANSWERED IT SEEMS TO ME STAMFORD I ADDED LOOKING HARD AT MY COMPANION
1505-1303-0035 THAT YOU HAVE SOME REASON FOR WASHING YOUR HANDS OF THE MATTER IS THIS FELLOW'S TEMPER SO FORMIDABLE OR WHAT IS IT DON'T BE MEALY MOUTHED ABOUT IT IT IS NOT EASY TO EXPRESS THE INEXPRESSIBLE HE ANSWERED WITH A LAUGH
1505-1303-0036 HOLMES IS A LITTLE TOO SCIENTIFIC FOR MY TASTES IT APPROACHES TO COLD BLOODEDNESS I COULD IMAGINE HIS GIVING A FRIEND A LITTLE PINCH OF THE LATEST VEGETABLE ALKALOID NOT OUT OF MALEVOLENCE YOU UNDERSTAND BUT
1505-1303-0037 SIMPLY OUT OF A SPIRIT OF INQUIRY IN ORDER TO HAVE AN ACCURATE IDEA OF THE EFFECTS TO DO HIM JUSTICE I THINK THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT HIMSELF WITH THE SAME READINESS HE APPEARS TO HAVE A PASSION FOR DEFINITE AND EXACT KNOWLEDGE
1505-1303-0038 VERY RIGHT TOO YES BUT IT MAY BE PUSHED TO EXCESS WHEN IT COMES TO BEATING THE SUBJECTS IN THE DISSECTING ROOMS WITH A STICK IT IS CERTAINLY TAKING RATHER A BIZARRE SHAPE BEATING THE SUBJECTS
1505-1303-0039 YES TO VERIFY HOW FAR BRUISES MAY BE PRODUCED AFTER DEATH I SAW HIM AT IT WITH MY OWN EYES AND YET YOU SAY HE IS NOT A MEDICAL STUDENT NO HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THE OBJECTS OF HIS STUDIES ARE
1505-1303-0040 BUT HERE WE ARE AND YOU MUST FORM YOUR OWN IMPRESSIONS ABOUT HIM AS HE SPOKE WE TURNED DOWN A NARROW LANE AND PASSED THROUGH A SMALL SIDE DOOR WHICH OPENED INTO A WING OF THE GREAT HOSPITAL IT WAS FAMILIAR GROUND TO ME
1505-1303-0041 AND I NEEDED NO GUIDING AS WE ASCENDED THE BLEAK STONE STAIRCASE AND MADE OUR WAY DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR WITH ITS VISTA OF WHITEWASHED WALL AND DUN COLOURED DOORS NEAR THE FURTHER END A LOW ARCHED PASSAGE BRANCHED AWAY FROM IT
1505-1303-0042 THIS WAS A LOFTY CHAMBER LINED AND LITTERED WITH COUNTLESS BOTTLES BROAD LOW TABLES WERE SCATTERED ABOUT WHICH BRISTLED WITH RETORTS TEST TUBES
1505-1303-0043 WHO WAS BENDING OVER A DISTANT TABLE ABSORBED IN HIS WORK AT THE SOUND OF OUR STEPS HE GLANCED ROUND AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH A CRY OF PLEASURE I'VE FOUND IT I'VE FOUND IT HE SHOUTED TO MY COMPANION RUNNING TOWARDS US WITH A TEST TUBE IN HIS HAND
1505-1303-0044 HAD HE DISCOVERED A GOLD MINE GREATER DELIGHT COULD NOT HAVE SHONE UPON HIS FEATURES DOCTOR WATSON MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID STAMFORD INTRODUCING US
1505-1303-0045 HOW ARE YOU HE SAID CORDIALLY GRIPPING MY HAND WITH A STRENGTH FOR WHICH I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM CREDIT YOU HAVE BEEN IN AFGHANISTAN I PERCEIVE HOW ON EARTH DID YOU KNOW THAT I ASKED IN ASTONISHMENT NEVER MIND SAID HE CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF
1505-1303-0046 NO DOUBT YOU SEE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY OF MINE IT IS INTERESTING CHEMICALLY NO DOUBT I ANSWERED BUT PRACTICALLY WHY MAN IT IS THE MOST PRACTICAL MEDICO LEGAL DISCOVERY FOR YEARS
1505-1303-0047 COME OVER HERE NOW HE SEIZED ME BY THE COAT SLEEVE IN HIS EAGERNESS AND DREW ME OVER TO THE TABLE AT WHICH HE HAD BEEN WORKING LET US HAVE SOME FRESH BLOOD HE SAID DIGGING A LONG BODKIN INTO HIS FINGER
1505-1303-0048 AND DRAWING OFF THE RESULTING DROP OF BLOOD IN A CHEMICAL PIPETTE NOW I ADD THIS SMALL QUANTITY OF BLOOD TO A LITRE OF WATER YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE RESULTING MIXTURE HAS THE APPEARANCE OF PURE WATER THE PROPORTION OF BLOOD CANNOT BE MORE THAN ONE IN A MILLION
1505-1303-0049 I HAVE NO DOUBT HOWEVER THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CHARACTERISTIC REACTION AS HE SPOKE HE THREW INTO THE VESSEL A FEW WHITE CRYSTALS AND THEN ADDED SOME DROPS OF A TRANSPARENT FLUID IN AN INSTANT
1505-1303-0050 THE CONTENTS ASSUMED A DULL MAHOGANY COLOUR AND A BROWNISH DUST WAS PRECIPITATED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS JAR HA HA HE CRIED CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LOOKING AS DELIGHTED AS A CHILD WITH A NEW TOY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
1505-1303-0051 IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY DELICATE TEST I REMARKED BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL THE OLD GUIACUM TEST WAS VERY CLUMSY AND UNCERTAIN SO IS THE MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION FOR BLOOD CORPUSCLES
1505-1303-0052 THE LATTER IS VALUELESS IF THE STAINS ARE A FEW HOURS OLD NOW THIS APPEARS TO ACT AS WELL WHETHER THE BLOOD IS OLD OR NEW HAD THIS TEST BEEN INVENTED
1505-1303-0053 INDEED I MURMURED CRIMINAL CASES ARE CONTINUALLY HINGING UPON THAT ONE POINT A MAN IS SUSPECTED OF A CRIME MONTHS PERHAPS AFTER IT HAS BEEN COMMITTED HIS LINEN OR CLOTHES ARE EXAMINED
1505-1303-0054 AND BROWNISH STAINS DISCOVERED UPON THEM ARE THEY BLOOD STAINS OR MUD STAINS OR RUST STAINS OR FRUIT STAINS OR WHAT ARE THEY THAT IS A QUESTION WHICH HAS PUZZLED MANY AN EXPERT AND WHY
1505-1303-0055 BECAUSE THERE WAS NO RELIABLE TEST NOW WE HAVE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES TEST AND THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY DIFFICULTY HIS EYES FAIRLY GLITTERED AS HE SPOKE AND HE PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART
1505-1303-0056 AND BOWED AS IF TO SOME APPLAUDING CROWD CONJURED UP BY HIS IMAGINATION YOU ARE TO BE CONGRATULATED I REMARKED CONSIDERABLY SURPRISED AT HIS ENTHUSIASM THERE WAS THE CASE OF VON BISCHOFF AT FRANKFORT LAST YEAR
1505-1303-0057 HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN HUNG HAD THIS TEST BEEN IN EXISTENCE THEN THERE WAS MASON OF BRADFORD AND THE NOTORIOUS MULLER AND LEFEVRE OF MONTPELLIER AND SAMSON OF NEW ORLEANS
1505-1303-0058 YOU SEEM TO BE A WALKING CALENDAR OF CRIME SAID STAMFORD WITH A LAUGH YOU MIGHT START A PAPER ON THOSE LINES CALL IT THE POLICE NEWS OF THE PAST
1505-1303-0059 REMARKED SHERLOCK HOLMES STICKING A SMALL PIECE OF PLASTER OVER THE PRICK ON HIS FINGER I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HE CONTINUED TURNING TO ME WITH A SMILE FOR I DABBLE WITH POISONS A GOOD DEAL HE HELD OUT HIS HAND AS HE SPOKE
1505-1303-0060 AND I NOTICED THAT IT WAS ALL MOTTLED OVER WITH SIMILAR PIECES OF PLASTER AND DISCOLOURED WITH STRONG ACIDS WE CAME HERE ON BUSINESS SAID STAMFORD SITTING DOWN ON A HIGH THREE LEGGED STOOL AND PUSHING ANOTHER ONE IN MY DIRECTION WITH HIS FOOT
1505-1303-0061 MY FRIEND HERE WANTS TO TAKE DIGGINGS AND AS YOU WERE COMPLAINING THAT YOU COULD GET NO ONE TO GO HALVES WITH YOU
1505-1303-0062 TOGETHER SHERLOCK HOLMES SEEMED DELIGHTED AT THE IDEA OF SHARING HIS ROOMS WITH ME I HAVE MY EYE ON A SUITE IN BAKER STREET HE SAID WHICH WOULD SUIT US DOWN TO THE GROUND YOU DON'T MIND THE SMELL OF STRONG TOBACCO I HOPE
1505-1303-0063 I ANSWERED THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH I GENERALLY HAVE CHEMICALS ABOUT AND OCCASIONALLY DO EXPERIMENTS WOULD THAT ANNOY YOU BY NO MEANS LET ME SEE WHAT ARE MY OTHER SHORTCOMINGS I GET IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES AND DON'T OPEN MY MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END
1505-1303-0064 YOU MUST NOT THINK I AM SULKY WHEN I DO THAT JUST LET ME ALONE AND I'LL SOON BE RIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU TO CONFESS NOW
1505-1303-0065 I LAUGHED AT THIS CROSS EXAMINATION I KEEP A BULL PUP I SAID AND I OBJECT TO ROWS BECAUSE MY NERVES ARE SHAKEN AND I GET UP AT ALL SORTS OF UNGODLY HOURS AND I AM EXTREMELY LAZY
1505-1303-0066 I HAVE ANOTHER SET OF VICES WHEN I'M WELL BUT THOSE ARE THE PRINCIPAL ONES AT PRESENT
1505-1303-0067 IT DEPENDS ON THE PLAYER I ANSWERED A WELL PLAYED VIOLIN IS A TREAT FOR THE GODS A BADLY PLAYED ONE OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT HE CRIED WITH A MERRY LAUGH I THINK WE MAY CONSIDER THE THING AS SETTLED THAT IS IF THE ROOMS ARE AGREEABLE TO YOU
1505-1303-0068 WHEN SHALL WE SEE THEM CALL FOR ME HERE AT NOON TO MORROW AND WE'LL GO TOGETHER AND SETTLE EVERYTHING HE ANSWERED ALL RIGHT NOON EXACTLY SAID I SHAKING HIS HAND WE LEFT HIM WORKING AMONG HIS CHEMICALS
1505-1303-0069 AND WE WALKED TOGETHER TOWARDS MY HOTEL BY THE WAY I ASKED SUDDENLY STOPPING AND TURNING UPON STAMFORD
1505-1303-0070 MY COMPANION SMILED AN ENIGMATICAL SMILE THAT'S JUST HIS LITTLE PECULIARITY HE SAID A GOOD MANY PEOPLE HAVE WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE FINDS THINGS OUT
1505-1303-0071 OH A MYSTERY IS IT I CRIED RUBBING MY HANDS THIS IS VERY PIQUANT I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER THE PROPER STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN YOU KNOW
1505-1303-0072 YOU MUST STUDY HIM THEN STAMFORD SAID AS HE BADE ME GOOD BYE YOU'LL FIND HIM A KNOTTY PROBLEM THOUGH I'LL WAGER HE LEARNS MORE ABOUT YOU THAN YOU ABOUT HIM GOOD BYE GOOD BYE I ANSWERED
