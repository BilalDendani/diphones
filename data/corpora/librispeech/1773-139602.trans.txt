1773-139602-0000 LONG LONG AGO THERE LIVED AN OLD FARMER AND HIS WIFE
1773-139602-0001 FAR FROM ANY TOWN THEIR ONLY NEIGHBOR WAS A BAD AND MALICIOUS BADGER THIS BADGER USED TO COME OUT EVERY NIGHT
1773-139602-0002 AND SPOIL THE VEGETABLES AND THE RICE WHICH THE FARMER SPENT HIS TIME IN CAREFULLY CULTIVATING
1773-139602-0003 AND DID SO MUCH HARM EVERYWHERE ON THE FARM THAT THE GOOD NATURED FARMER COULD NOT STAND IT ANY LONGER AND DETERMINED TO PUT A STOP TO IT SO HE LAY IN WAIT DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WITH A BIG CLUB
1773-139602-0004 HOPING TO CATCH THE BADGER BUT ALL IN VAIN THEN HE LAID TRAPS FOR THE WICKED ANIMAL THE FARMER'S TROUBLE AND PATIENCE WAS REWARDED FOR ONE FINE DAY ON GOING HIS ROUNDS
1773-139602-0005 HE FOUND THE BADGER CAUGHT IN A HOLE HE HAD DUG FOR THAT PURPOSE
1773-139602-0006 AND CARRIED HIM HOME SECURELY BOUND WITH ROPE WHEN HE REACHED THE HOUSE THE FARMER SAID TO HIS WIFE
1773-139602-0007 YOU MUST KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
1773-139602-0008 BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE HIM INTO SOUP TO NIGHT SAYING THIS
1773-139602-0009 AND WENT OUT TO HIS WORK IN THE FIELDS
1773-139602-0010 AND HE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME TRYING TO HIT UPON SOME PLAN BY WHICH HE MIGHT ESCAPE IT WAS HARD TO THINK CLEARLY IN HIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION FOR HE HAD BEEN HUNG UPSIDE DOWN
1773-139602-0011 VERY NEAR HIM AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE STOREHOUSE
1773-139602-0012 STOOD THE FARMER'S OLD WIFE POUNDING BARLEY SHE LOOKED TIRED AND OLD HER FACE WAS SEAMED WITH MANY WRINKLES AND WAS AS BROWN AS LEATHER
1773-139602-0013 SHE STOPPED TO WIPE THE PERSPIRATION WHICH ROLLED DOWN HER FACE DEAR LADY SAID THE WILY BADGER
1773-139602-0014 MY ARMS ARE VERY STRONG
1773-139602-0015 THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
1773-139602-0016 FOR YOU MIGHT ESCAPE IF I DID
1773-139602-0017 NOW THE BADGER IS ONE OF THE MOST CUNNING OF ANIMALS
1773-139602-0018 YOU ARE VERY UNKIND YOU MIGHT UNTIE ME FOR I PROMISE NOT TO TRY TO ESCAPE IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF YOUR HUSBAND
1773-139602-0019 WHEN I HAVE FINISHED POUNDING THE BARLEY I AM SO TIRED AND SORE TIED UP LIKE THIS
1773-139602-0020 THE OLD WOMAN HAD A GOOD AND SIMPLE NATURE AND COULD NOT THINK BADLY OF ANY ONE
1773-139602-0021 THAT THE BADGER WAS ONLY DECEIVING HER IN ORDER TO GET AWAY SHE FELT SORRY TOO FOR THE ANIMAL AS SHE TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM HE LOOKED IN SUCH A SAD PLIGHT HANGING DOWNWARDS FROM THE CEILING BY HIS LEGS
1773-139602-0022 WHICH WERE ALL TIED TOGETHER SO TIGHTLY THAT THE ROPE AND THE KNOTS WERE CUTTING INTO THE SKIN
1773-139602-0023 SHE UNTIED THE CORD AND LET HIM DOWN THE OLD WOMAN THEN GAVE HIM THE WOODEN PESTLE AND TOLD HIM TO DO THE WORK FOR A SHORT TIME WHILE SHE RESTED HE TOOK THE PESTLE BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THE WORK AS HE WAS TOLD
1773-139602-0024 THE BADGER AT ONCE SPRANG UPON THE OLD WOMAN AND KNOCKED HER DOWN WITH THE HEAVY PIECE OF WOOD HE THEN KILLED HER AND CUT HER UP AND MADE SOUP OF HER AND WAITED FOR THE RETURN OF THE OLD FARMER THE OLD MAN WORKED HARD IN HIS FIELDS ALL DAY
1773-139602-0025 AND AS HE WORKED HE THOUGHT WITH PLEASURE THAT NO MORE NOW WOULD HIS LABOR BE SPOILED BY THE DESTRUCTIVE BADGER TOWARDS SUNSET HE LEFT HIS WORK AND TURNED TO GO HOME HE WAS VERY TIRED
1773-139602-0026 BUT THE THOUGHT OF THE NICE SUPPER OF HOT BADGER SOUP AWAITING HIS RETURN CHEERED HIM THE THOUGHT THAT THE BADGER MIGHT GET FREE AND TAKE REVENGE ON THE POOR OLD WOMAN NEVER ONCE CAME INTO HIS MIND
1773-139602-0027 THE BADGER MEANWHILE ASSUMED THE OLD WOMAN'S FORM AND AS SOON AS HE SAW THE OLD FARMER APPROACHING CAME OUT TO GREET HIM ON THE VERANDA OF THE LITTLE HOUSE SAYING SO YOU
1773-139602-0028 THAT IT WAS NOT HIS WIFE BUT THE BADGER WHO WAS WAITING UPON HIM AND ASKED AT ONCE FOR THE SOUP
1773-139602-0029 LOOK OUT FOR THE BONES IN THE KITCHEN LAUGHING LOUDLY
1773-139602-0030 AND RAN AWAY TO HIS DEN IN THE HILLS THE OLD MAN WAS LEFT BEHIND ALONE HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD THEN WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE TRUTH HE WAS SO SCARED AND HORRIFIED
1773-139602-0031 THAT HE FAINTED RIGHT AWAY AFTER A WHILE HE CAME ROUND AND BURST INTO TEARS HE CRIED LOUDLY AND BITTERLY HE ROCKED HIMSELF TO AND FRO IN HIS HOPELESS GRIEF IT SEEMED TOO TERRIBLE TO BE REAL
1773-139602-0032 THAT HIS FAITHFUL OLD WIFE HAD BEEN KILLED AND COOKED BY THE BADGER
1773-139602-0033 KNOWING NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AT HOME AND CONGRATULATING HIMSELF
1773-139602-0034 WHICH THE CREATURE HAD MADE OF HIS POOR OLD WOMAN
1773-139602-0035 DEAR HE WAILED ALOUD NOW NOT FAR AWAY THERE LIVED IN THE SAME MOUNTAIN A KIND GOOD NATURED OLD RABBIT HE HEARD THE OLD MAN CRYING AND SOBBING AND AT ONCE SET OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
1773-139602-0036 AND IF THERE WAS ANYTHING HE COULD DO TO HELP HIS NEIGHBOR THE OLD MAN TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN THE RABBIT HEARD THE STORY HE WAS VERY ANGRY AT THE WICKED AND DECEITFUL BADGER AND TOLD THE OLD MAN TO LEAVE EVERYTHING TO HIM
1773-139602-0037 THE FARMER WAS AT LAST COMFORTED
1773-139602-0038 THE RABBIT SEEING THAT THE FARMER WAS GROWING CALMER
1773-139602-0039 THE NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS FINE AND THE RABBIT WENT OUT TO FIND THE BADGER HE WAS NOT TO BE SEEN IN THE WOODS OR ON THE HILLSIDE OR IN THE FIELDS ANYWHERE
1773-139602-0040 WILLINGLY CONSENTED TO GO OUT WITH HIM ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE FARMER AND THE FEAR OF MEETING HIM THE RABBIT LED THE WAY MILES AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES OUT ON THE HILLS
1773-139602-0041 WHERE THE GRASS GREW TALL AND THICK AND SWEET THEY BOTH SET TO WORK TO CUT DOWN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD CARRY HOME
1773-139602-0042 WHEN THEY HAD EACH CUT DOWN ALL THEY WANTED THEY TIED IT IN BUNDLES AND THEN STARTED HOMEWARDS EACH CARRYING HIS BUNDLE OF GRASS ON HIS BACK THIS TIME THE RABBIT MADE THE BADGER GO FIRST WHEN THEY HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY
1773-139602-0043 THE RABBIT TOOK OUT A FLINT AND STEEL AND STRIKING IT OVER THE BADGER'S BACK AS HE STEPPED ALONG IN FRONT SET HIS BUNDLE OF GRASS ON FIRE THE BADGER HEARD THE FLINT STRIKING AND ASKED
1773-139602-0044 CRACK OH THAT IS NOTHING
1773-139602-0045 THE FIRE SOON SPREAD IN THE BUNDLE OF DRY GRASS ON THE BADGER'S BACK THE BADGER HEARING THE CRACKLE OF THE BURNING GRASS ASKED
1773-139602-0046 ANSWERED THE RABBIT BY THIS TIME THE BUNDLE WAS NEARLY BURNED OUT AND ALL THE HAIR HAD BEEN BURNED OFF THE BADGER'S BACK HE NOW KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED BY THE SMELL OF THE SMOKE OF THE BURNING GRASS
1773-139602-0047 SCREAMING WITH PAIN THE BADGER RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD TO HIS HOLE THE RABBIT FOLLOWED
1773-139602-0048 SAID THE RABBIT I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THIS HAPPENED
1773-139602-0049 FOR HE FELT THAT NOTHING COULD BE TOO BAD FOR THE ANIMAL WHO WAS GUILTY OF MURDERING A POOR HELPLESS OLD WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED HIM HE WENT HOME AND MADE AN OINTMENT BY MIXING SOME SAUCE AND RED PEPPER TOGETHER
1773-139602-0050 HE CARRIED THIS TO THE BADGER BUT BEFORE PUTTING IT ON HE TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD CAUSE HIM GREAT PAIN BUT THAT HE MUST BEAR IT PATIENTLY BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY WONDERFUL MEDICINE FOR BURNS
1773-139602-0051 AND SCALDS AND SUCH WOUNDS THE BADGER THANKED HIM AND BEGGED HIM TO APPLY IT AT ONCE BUT NO LANGUAGE CAN DESCRIBE THE AGONY OF THE BADGER
1773-139602-0052 AS SOON AS THE RED PEPPER HAD BEEN PASTED ALL OVER HIS SORE BACK HE ROLLED OVER AND OVER
1773-139602-0053 THE RABBIT LOOKING ON FELT THAT THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS BEGINNING TO BE AVENGED
1773-139602-0054 AND HE GOT WELL WHEN THE RABBIT SAW THAT THE BADGER WAS GETTING WELL HE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER PLAN BY WHICH HE COULD COMPASS THE CREATURE'S DEATH SO HE WENT ONE DAY TO PAY THE BADGER A VISIT
1773-139602-0055 AND TO CONGRATULATE HIM ON HIS RECOVERY DURING THE CONVERSATION THE RABBIT MENTIONED THAT HE WAS GOING FISHING AND DESCRIBED HOW PLEASANT FISHING WAS WHEN THE WEATHER WAS FINE AND THE SEA SMOOTH
1773-139602-0056 THE BADGER LISTENED WITH PLEASURE TO THE RABBIT'S ACCOUNT OF THE WAY HE PASSED HIS TIME NOW AND FORGOT ALL HIS PAINS AND HIS MONTH'S ILLNESS AND THOUGHT WHAT FUN IT WOULD BE IF HE COULD GO FISHING TOO
1773-139602-0057 THIS WAS JUST WHAT THE RABBIT WANTED SO HE AGREED THEN HE WENT HOME AND BUILT TWO BOATS ONE OF WOOD AND THE OTHER OF CLAY AT LAST THEY WERE BOTH FINISHED AND AS THE RABBIT STOOD AND LOOKED AT HIS WORK
1773-139602-0058 IF HIS PLAN SUCCEEDED AND HE COULD MANAGE TO KILL THE WICKED BADGER NOW
1773-139602-0059 HE KEPT THE WOODEN BOAT HIMSELF AND GAVE THE BADGER THE CLAY BOAT THE BADGER WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT BOATS WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIS NEW BOAT AND THOUGHT HOW KIND IT WAS OF THE RABBIT TO GIVE IT TO HIM
1773-139602-0060 THEY BOTH GOT INTO THEIR BOATS AND SET OUT AFTER GOING SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SHORE
1773-139602-0061 AND SEE WHICH ONE COULD GO THE QUICKEST THE BADGER FELL IN WITH THE PROPOSAL AND THEY BOTH SET TO WORK TO ROW AS FAST AS THEY COULD FOR SOME TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RACE THE BADGER FOUND HIS BOAT GOING TO PIECES
1773-139602-0062 FOR THE WATER NOW BEGAN TO SOFTEN THE CLAY HE CRIED OUT IN GREAT FEAR TO THE RABBIT TO HELP HIM BUT THE RABBIT ANSWERED THAT HE WAS AVENGING THE OLD WOMAN'S MURDER AND THAT THIS HAD BEEN HIS INTENTION ALL ALONG
1773-139602-0063 AND WAS TO DROWN WITH NO ONE TO HELP HIM
1773-139602-0064 TILL HE FELL WITH THE SINKING CLAY BOAT AND WAS SEEN NO MORE THUS AT LAST HE KEPT HIS PROMISE TO THE OLD FARMER THE RABBIT NOW TURNED AND ROWED SHOREWARDS AND HAVING LANDED AND PULLED HIS BOAT
1773-139602-0065 UPON THE BEACH HURRIED BACK TO TELL THE OLD FARMER EVERYTHING AND HOW THE BADGER HIS ENEMY HAD BEEN KILLED THE OLD FARMER THANKED HIM WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES HE SAID THAT TILL NOW HE COULD NEVER SLEEP AT NIGHT
1773-139602-0066 OR BE AT PEACE IN THE DAYTIME THINKING OF HOW HIS WIFE'S DEATH WAS UNAVENGED BUT FROM THIS TIME HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SLEEP AND EAT AS OF OLD
1773-139602-0067 TO STAY WITH HIM AND SHARE HIS HOME SO FROM THIS DAY THE RABBIT WENT TO STAY WITH THE OLD FARMER AND THEY BOTH LIVED TOGETHER AS GOOD FRIENDS TO THE END OF THEIR DAYS
