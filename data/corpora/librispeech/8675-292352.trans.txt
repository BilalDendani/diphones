8675-292352-0000 AND THESE PROPHECIES ARE NO DOUBT NOW AS THEY WERE IN THE FENIAN DAYS A POLITICAL FORCE I HAVE HEARD OF ONE MAN WHO WOULD NOT GIVE ANY MONEY TO THE LAND LEAGUE BECAUSE THE BATTLE COULD NOT BE UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY BUT
8675-292352-0001 AS A RULE PERIODS OF TROUBLE BRING PROPHECIES OF ITS NEAR COMING A FEW YEARS BEFORE MY TIME AN OLD MAN WHO LIVED AT LISADELL IN SLIGO
8675-292352-0002 USED TO FALL DOWN IN A FIT AND RAVE OUT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE BATTLE AND A MAN IN SLIGO HAS TOLD ME THAT IT WILL BE SO GREAT A BATTLE THAT THE HORSES SHALL GO UP TO THEIR FETLOCKS IN BLOOD AND
8675-292352-0003 WILL ROT FROM THEIR BELLIES FOR LACK OF A HAND TO UNBUCKLE THEM THE BATTLE IS A MYTHOLOGICAL BATTLE AND THE BLACK PIG IS ONE WITH THE BRISTLELESS BOAR THAT KILLED DEARMOD IN NOVEMBER UPON THE WESTERN END OF BEN BULBEN
8675-292352-0004 WHOSE CARVING BROUGHT ON SO GREAT A BATTLE THE CROPPY BLACK SOW AND THE CUTTY BLACK SOW OF WELSH NOVEMBER RHYMES
8675-292352-0005 THE BOAR THAT KILLED ADONIS THE BOAR THAT KILLED ATTIS AND THE PIG EMBODIMENT OF TYPHON GOLDEN BOUGH TWO PAGES TWENTY SIX THIRTY ONE
8675-292352-0006 THE PIG SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ORIGINALLY A GENIUS OF THE CORN AND SEEMINGLY BECAUSE THE TOO GREAT POWER OF THEIR DIVINITY MAKES DIVINE THINGS DANGEROUS TO MORTALS ITS FLESH WAS FORBIDDEN TO MANY EASTERN NATIONS
8675-292352-0007 BUT AS THE MEANING OF THE PROHIBITION WAS FORGOTTEN ABHORRENCE TOOK THE PLACE OF REVERENCE PIGS AND BOARS GREW INTO TYPES OF EVIL AND WERE DESCRIBED AS THE ENEMIES OF THE VERY GODS THEY ONCE TYPIFIED GOLDEN BOUGH TWO
8675-292352-0008 FIFTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN THE PIG WOULD THEREFORE BECOME THE BLACK PIG A TYPE OF COLD AND OF WINTER THAT AWAKE IN NOVEMBER THE OLD BEGINNING OF WINTER TO DO BATTLE WITH THE SUMMER
8675-292352-0009 AND WITH THE FRUIT AND LEAVES AND FINALLY AS I SUGGEST AND AS I BELIEVE FOR THE PURPOSES OF POETRY OF THE DARKNESS THAT WILL AT LAST DESTROY THE GODS AND THE WORLD
8675-292352-0010 AND A GALWAY BLACKSMITH AND BLACKSMITHS ARE THOUGHT TO BE ESPECIALLY PROTECTED SAYS HE WOULD BE AFRAID TO MEET A PIG ON THE ROAD AT NIGHT AND ANOTHER GALWAY MAN TELLS THIS STORY
8675-292352-0011 THERE WAS A MAN COMING THE ROAD FROM GORT TO GARRYLAND ONE NIGHT AND HE HAD A DROP TAKEN AND BEFORE HIM ON THE ROAD HE SAW A PIG WALKING AND HAVING A DROP IN HE GAVE A SHOUT
8675-292352-0012 AND MADE A KICK AT IT AND BID IT GET OUT OF THAT AND BY THE TIME HE GOT HOME HIS ARM WAS SWELLED FROM THE SHOULDER TO BE AS BIG AS A BAG AND HE COULDN'T USE HIS HAND WITH THE PAIN OF IT
8675-292352-0013 AND HIS WIFE BROUGHT HIM AFTER A FEW DAYS TO A WOMAN THAT USED TO DO CURES AT RAHASANE AND ON THE ROAD ALL SHE COULD DO WOULD HARDLY KEEP HIM FROM LYING DOWN TO SLEEP ON THE GRASS
8675-292352-0014 AND WHEN THEY GOT TO THE WOMAN SHE KNEW ALL THAT HAPPENED AND SAYS SHE IT'S WELL FOR YOU THAT YOUR WIFE DIDN'T LET YOU FALL ASLEEP ON THE GRASS FOR IF YOU HAD DONE THAT BUT EVEN FOR ONE INSTANT
8675-292352-0015 YOU'D BE A LOST MAN IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BRISTLES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH FERTILITY AS THE TAIL CERTAINLY WAS FOR A PIG'S TAIL IS STUCK INTO THE GROUND IN COURLAND
8675-292352-0016 AND THE TAILS OF PIGS AND OTHER ANIMAL EMBODIMENTS OF THE CORN GENIUS ARE DRAGGED OVER THE GROUND TO MAKE IT FERTILE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES PROFESSOR RHYS WHO CONSIDERS THE BRISTLELESS BOAR A SYMBOL OF DARKNESS AND COLD
8675-292352-0017 RATHER THAN OF WINTER AND COLD THINKS IT WAS WITHOUT BRISTLES BECAUSE THE DARKNESS IS SHORN AWAY BY THE SUN IT MAY HAVE HAD DIFFERENT MEANINGS JUST AS THE SCOURGING OF THE MAN GOD HAS HAD DIFFERENT THOUGH NOT CONTRADICTORY MEANINGS
8675-292352-0018 IN DIFFERENT EPOCHS OF THE WORLD THE BATTLE SHOULD I BELIEVE BE COMPARED WITH THREE OTHER BATTLES
8675-292352-0019 A BATTLE THEY ARE SAID TO FIGHT IN NOVEMBER FOR THE HARVEST THE GREAT BATTLE THE TRIBES OF THE GODDESS DANU FOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE GAELIC CHRONICLERS
8675-292352-0020 OR THE TOWERY PLAIN I HAVE HEARD OF THE BATTLE OVER THE DYING BOTH IN COUNTY GALWAY AND IN THE ISLES OF ARANN AN OLD ARANN FISHERMAN HAVING TOLD ME THAT IT WAS FOUGHT OVER TWO OF HIS CHILDREN
8675-292352-0021 AND WHEN EVERY MAN WHO DIED WAS CARRIED THITHER HAVE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED DEATH I SUGGEST THAT THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE TRIBES OF THE GODDESS DANU THE POWERS OF LIGHT AND WARMTH AND FRUITFULNESS AND GOODNESS
8675-292352-0022 THE POWERS OF DARKNESS AND COLD AND BARRENNESS AND BADNESS UPON THE TOWERY PLAIN WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HABITABLE WORLD THE ROUT OF THE ANCESTRAL DARKNESS
8675-292352-0023 IS THE ANNUAL BATTLE OF SUMMER AND WINTER
8675-292352-0024 IS THE BATTLE OF LIFE AND DEATH AND THAT THE BATTLE OF THE BLACK PIG IS THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE MANIFEST WORLD AND THE ANCESTRAL DARKNESS AT THE END OF ALL THINGS AND THAT ALL THESE BATTLES ARE ONE
8675-292352-0025 THE BATTLE OF ALL THINGS WITH SHADOWY DECAY ONCE A SYMBOLISM HAS POSSESSED THE IMAGINATION OF LARGE NUMBERS OF MEN
