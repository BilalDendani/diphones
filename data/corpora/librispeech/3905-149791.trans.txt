3905-149791-0000 CHAPTER TEN UNDER WATER WHEN NIGHT FELL ALL THE INTERIOR OF THE GREAT DOME STREETS AND HOUSES BECAME LIGHTED WITH BRILLIANT INCANDESCENT LAMPS WHICH RENDERED IT BRIGHT AS DAY
3905-149791-0001 DOROTHY THOUGHT THE ISLAND MUST LOOK BEAUTIFUL BY NIGHT FROM THE OUTER SHORE OF THE LAKE THERE WAS REVELRY AND FEASTING IN THE QUEEN'S PALACE AND THE MUSIC OF THE ROYAL BAND COULD BE PLAINLY HEARD IN LADY AUREX'S HOUSE WHERE OZMA AND DOROTHY REMAINED WITH THEIR HOSTESS AND KEEPER
3905-149791-0002 THEY WERE PRISONERS BUT TREATED WITH MUCH CONSIDERATION LADY AUREX GAVE THEM A NICE SUPPER AND WHEN THEY WISHED TO RETIRE SHOWED THEM TO A PRETTY ROOM WITH COMFORTABLE BEDS AND WISHED THEM A GOOD NIGHT AND PLEASANT DREAMS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS OZMA
3905-149791-0003 DOROTHY ANXIOUSLY INQUIRED WHEN THEY WERE ALONE I AM GLAD WE CAME WAS THE REPLY FOR ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE MISCHIEF DONE TO MORROW IT WAS NECESSARY I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THESE PEOPLE WHOSE LEADERS ARE WILD AND LAWLESS
3905-149791-0004 AND OPPRESS THEIR SUBJECTS WITH INJUSTICE AND CRUELTIES MY TASK THEREFORE IS TO LIBERATE THE SKEEZERS AND THE FLATHEADS AND SECURE FOR THEM FREEDOM AND HAPPINESS I HAVE NO DOUBT I CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS IN TIME JUST NOW THOUGH WE'RE IN A BAD FIX
3905-149791-0005 ASSERTED DOROTHY IF QUEEN COO EE OH CONQUERS TO MORROW SHE WON'T BE NICE TO US AND IF THE SU DIC CONQUERS HE'LL BE WORSE DO NOT WORRY DEAR SAID OZMA I DO NOT THINK WE ARE IN DANGER WHATEVER HAPPENS
3905-149791-0006 DOROTHY WAS NOT WORRYING ESPECIALLY SHE HAD CONFIDENCE IN HER FRIEND THE FAIRY PRINCESS OF OZ AND SHE ENJOYED THE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENTS IN WHICH SHE WAS TAKING PART
3905-149791-0007 SO SHE CREPT INTO BED AND FELL ASLEEP AS EASILY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN IN HER OWN COSY ROOM IN OZMA'S PALACE A SORT OF GRATING GRINDING SOUND AWAKENED HER THE WHOLE ISLAND SEEMED TO TREMBLE AND SWAY AS IT MIGHT DO IN AN EARTHQUAKE
3905-149791-0008 DOROTHY SAT UP IN BED RUBBING HER EYES TO GET THE SLEEP OUT OF THEM AND THEN FOUND IT WAS DAYBREAK OZMA WAS HURRIEDLY DRESSING HERSELF
3905-149791-0009 ASKED DOROTHY JUMPING OUT OF BED I'M NOT SURE ANSWERED OZMA BUT IT FEELS AS IF THE ISLAND IS SINKING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY FINISHED DRESSING WHILE THE CREAKING AND SWAYING CONTINUED THEN THEY RUSHED INTO THE LIVING ROOM OF THE HOUSE
3905-149791-0010 AND FOUND LADY AUREX FULLY DRESSED AWAITING THEM DO NOT BE ALARMED SAID THEIR HOSTESS COO EE OH HAS DECIDED TO SUBMERGE THE ISLAND THAT IS ALL BUT IT PROVES THE FLATHEADS ARE COMING TO ATTACK US
3905-149791-0011 SUB MERGING THE ISLAND ASKED DOROTHY COME HERE AND SEE WAS THE REPLY LADY AUREX LED THEM TO A WINDOW WHICH FACED THE SIDE OF THE GREAT DOME WHICH COVERED ALL THE VILLAGE AND THEY COULD SEE THAT THE ISLAND WAS INDEED SINKING
3905-149791-0012 FOR THE WATER OF THE LAKE WAS ALREADY HALF WAY UP THE SIDE OF THE DOME THROUGH THE GLASS COULD BE SEEN SWIMMING FISHES AND TALL STALKS OF SWAYING SEAWEEDS FOR THE WATER WAS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL AND THROUGH IT THEY COULD DISTINGUISH EVEN THE FARTHER SHORE OF THE LAKE
3905-149791-0013 THE FLATHEADS ARE NOT HERE YET SAID LADY AUREX THEY WILL COME SOON BUT NOT UNTIL ALL OF THIS DOME IS UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WON'T THE DOME LEAK DOROTHY INQUIRED ANXIOUSLY NO INDEED
3905-149791-0014 SUNK BEFORE OH YES ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BUT COO EE OH DOESN'T CARE TO DO THAT OFTEN FOR IT REQUIRES A LOT OF HARD WORK TO OPERATE THE MACHINERY THE DOME WAS BUILT SO THAT THE ISLAND COULD DISAPPEAR
3905-149791-0015 I THINK SHE CONTINUED THAT OUR QUEEN FEARS THE FLATHEADS WILL ATTACK THE ISLAND AND TRY TO BREAK THE GLASS OF THE DOME WELL IF WE'RE UNDER WATER THEY CAN'T FIGHT US AND WE CAN'T FIGHT THEM ASSERTED DOROTHY
3905-149791-0016 THEY COULD KILL THE FISHES HOWEVER SAID OZMA GRAVELY WE HAVE WAYS TO FIGHT ALSO
3905-149791-0017 CLAIMED LADY AUREX I CANNOT TELL YOU ALL OUR SECRETS BUT THIS ISLAND IS FULL OF SURPRISES ALSO OUR QUEEN'S MAGIC IS ASTONISHING DID SHE STEAL IT ALL FROM THE THREE ADEPTS IN SORCERY THAT ARE NOW FISHES
3905-149791-0018 SHE STOLE THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE MAGIC TOOLS BUT SHE HAS USED THEM AS THE THREE ADEPTS NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE BY THIS TIME THE TOP OF THE DOME WAS QUITE UNDER WATER AND SUDDENLY THE ISLAND STOPPED SINKING AND BECAME STATIONARY
3905-149791-0019 SEE CRIED LADY AUREX POINTING TO THE SHORE THE FLATHEADS HAVE COME ON THE BANK WHICH WAS NOW FAR ABOVE THEIR HEADS A CROWD OF DARK FIGURES COULD BE SEEN NOW LET US SEE WHAT COO EE OH WILL DO TO OPPOSE THEM
3905-149791-0020 CONTINUED LADY AUREX IN A VOICE THAT BETRAYED HER EXCITEMENT THE FLATHEADS PUSHING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE LINE OF PALM TREES HAD REACHED THE SHORE OF THE LAKE JUST AS THE TOP OF THE ISLAND'S DOME DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
3905-149791-0021 THE WATER NOW FLOWED FROM SHORE TO SHORE BUT THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER THE DOME WAS STILL VISIBLE AND THE HOUSES OF THE SKEEZERS COULD BE DIMLY SEEN THROUGH THE PANES OF GLASS GOOD EXCLAIMED THE SU DIC
3905-149791-0022 WHO HAD ARMED ALL HIS FOLLOWERS AND HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM TWO COPPER VESSELS WHICH HE CAREFULLY SET DOWN UPON THE GROUND BESIDE HIM IF COO EE OH WANTS TO HIDE INSTEAD OF FIGHTING OUR JOB WILL BE EASY FOR IN ONE OF THESE COPPER VESSELS I HAVE ENOUGH POISON TO KILL EVERY FISH IN THE LAKE
3905-149791-0023 KILL THEM THEN WHILE WE HAVE TIME AND THEN WE CAN GO HOME AGAIN ADVISED ONE OF THE CHIEF OFFICERS NOT YET OBJECTED THE SU DIC THE QUEEN OF THE SKEEZERS HAS DEFIED ME AND I WANT TO GET HER INTO MY POWER AS WELL AS TO DESTROY HER MAGIC
3905-149791-0024 SHE TRANSFORMED MY POOR WIFE INTO A GOLDEN PIG AND I MUST HAVE REVENGE FOR THAT WHATEVER ELSE WE DO LOOK OUT SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED THE OFFICERS POINTING INTO THE LAKE SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN
3905-149791-0025 FROM THE SUBMERGED DOME A DOOR OPENED AND SOMETHING BLACK SHOT SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE WATER THE DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSED BEHIND IT AND THE DARK OBJECT CLEAVED ITS WAY THROUGH THE WATER WITHOUT RISING TO THE SURFACE DIRECTLY TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE THE FLATHEADS WERE STANDING
3905-149791-0026 THAT IS ONE OF THE QUEEN'S SUBMARINES WAS THE REPLY IT IS ALL ENCLOSED AND CAN MOVE UNDER WATER COO EE OH HAS SEVERAL OF THESE BOATS WHICH ARE KEPT IN LITTLE ROOMS IN THE BASEMENT UNDER OUR VILLAGE WHEN THE ISLAND IS SUBMERGED
3905-149791-0027 THE QUEEN USES THESE BOATS TO REACH THE SHORE AND I BELIEVE SHE NOW INTENDS TO FIGHT THE FLATHEADS WITH THEM THE SU DIC AND HIS PEOPLE KNEW NOTHING OF COO EE OH'S SUBMARINES SO THEY WATCHED WITH SURPRISE AS THE UNDER WATER BOAT APPROACHED THEM
3905-149791-0028 WHEN IT WAS QUITE NEAR THE SHORE IT ROSE TO THE SURFACE AND THE TOP PARTED AND FELL BACK DISCLOSING A BOAT FULL OF ARMED SKEEZERS AT THE HEAD WAS THE QUEEN STANDING UP IN THE BOW AND HOLDING IN ONE HAND
3905-149791-0029 A COIL OF MAGIC ROPE THAT GLEAMED LIKE SILVER THE BOAT HALTED AND COO EE OH DREW BACK HER ARM TO THROW THE SILVER ROPE TOWARD THE SU DIC WHO WAS NOW BUT A FEW FEET FROM HER
