6333-39678-0011 THEN YOU SAY RESUMED THE DECEIVED INTENDANT THAT THE INITIATIVE CAME FROM THE PEOPLE
6333-39678-0012 THE AFFAIR ORIGINATED WITH FOUQUET DOES NOT EVERYBODY KNOW THAT THE CONDEMNED WERE HIS FRIENDS FROM CHILDHOOD THAT IS TRUE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AND THUS ARE ALL MY DOUBTS CLEARED UP I REPEAT IT

6333-39678-0022 SIMPLY TO THIS THE KING ORDERED ME TO COME TO YOU AH SAID COLBERT RECOVERING HIMSELF WHEN HE SAW D'ARTAGNAN DRAW A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET IT IS TO DEMAND SOME MONEY OF ME PRECISELY MONSIEUR
6333-39678-0023 TILL I HAVE DISPATCHED THE REPORT OF THE WATCH D'ARTAGNAN TURNED UPON HIS HEEL INSOLENTLY ENOUGH AND FINDING HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH COLBERT AFTER HIS FIRST TURN HE BOWED TO HIM AS A HARLEQUIN WOULD HAVE DONE THEN
6333-39678-0024 HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR IN QUICK TIME COLBERT WAS STRUCK WITH THIS POINTED RUDENESS TO WHICH HE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED
6333-39678-0025 HAD SUCH A WANT OF MONEY THAT THOUGH THEIR FEET SEEMED TO TAKE ROOT IN THE MARBLE THEY HARDLY LOST THEIR PATIENCE WAS D'ARTAGNAN GOING STRAIGHT TO THE KING WOULD HE GO AND DESCRIBE HIS ROUGH RECEPTION OR RECOUNT HIS EXPLOIT
6333-39678-0026 THIS WAS A MATTER FOR GRAVE CONSIDERATION AT ALL EVENTS THE MOMENT WAS BADLY CHOSEN TO SEND D'ARTAGNAN AWAY
6333-39678-0027 FOR IT TO BE ALREADY FORGOTTEN THEREFORE COLBERT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SHAKE OFF HIS ARROGANCE AND CALL D'ARTAGNAN BACK
6333-39678-0028 CRIED COLBERT WHAT ARE YOU LEAVING ME THUS D'ARTAGNAN TURNED ROUND WHY NOT SAID HE QUIETLY WE HAVE NO MORE TO SAY TO EACH OTHER HAVE WE
6333-39678-0029 YOU HAVE AT LEAST MONEY TO RECEIVE AS YOU HAVE AN ORDER

6333-39678-0065 SNATCHING THE PAPER FROM HIM WITH A RAPID MOVEMENT
