6660-103629-0000 HASTY CENSURES DO INDEED SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THE CHARGE OF VARIABLENESS AND INCONSISTENCY IN JUDGMENT AND SO THEY OUGHT FOR IF YOU EVEN YOU MY DEAR WERE SO LOTH TO OWN A MISTAKE AS IN THE INSTANCE BEFORE US YOU PRETEND YOU WERE
6660-103629-0001 I BELIEVE I SHOULD NOT HAVE LOVED YOU SO WELL AS I REALLY DO LOVE YOU NOR COULD YOU IN THAT CASE HAVE SO FRANKLY THROWN THE REFLECTION I HINT AT UPON YOURSELF HAVE NOT YOUR MIND BEEN ONE OF THE MOST INGENUOUS THAT EVER WOMAN BOASTED MISTER LOVELACE HAS FAULTS ENOW TO DESERVE VERY SEVERE CENSURE
6660-103629-0002 ALTHOUGH HE BE NOT GUILTY OF THIS IF I WERE UPON SUCH TERMS WITH HIM AS HE COULD WISH ME TO BE I SHOULD GIVE HIM SUCH A HINT THAT THIS TREACHEROUS JOSEPH LEMAN CANNOT BE SO MUCH ATTACHED TO HIM AS PERHAPS HE THINKS HIM TO BE IF IT WERE HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO READY TO REPORT TO HIS DISADVANTAGE
6660-103629-0003 AND TO BETTY BARNES TOO THIS SLIGHT AFFAIR OF THE PRETTY RUSTIC JOSEPH HAS ENGAGED BETTY TO SECRECY PROMISING TO LET HER AND HER YOUNG MASTER TO KNOW MORE WHEN HE KNOWS THE WHOLE OF THE MATTER AND THIS HINDERS HER FROM MENTIONING IT AS SHE IS NEVERTHELESS AGOG TO DO
6660-103629-0004 TO MY SISTER OR BROTHER AND THEN SHE DOES NOT CHOOSE TO DISOBLIGE JOSEPH FOR ALTHOUGH SHE PRETENDS TO LOOK ABOVE HIM SHE LISTENS I BELIEVE TO SOME LOVE STORIES HE TELLS HER WOMEN HAVING IT NOT IN THEIR POWER TO BEGIN A COURTSHIP SOME OF THEM VERY FREQUENTLY I BELIEVE
6660-103629-0005 LEND AN EAR WHERE THEIR HEARTS INCLINE NOT BUT TO SAY NO MORE OF THESE LOW PEOPLE NEITHER OF WHOM I THINK TOLERABLY OF I MUST NEEDS OWN THAT AS I SHOULD FOR EVER HAVE DESPISED THIS MAN HAD HE BEEN CAPABLE OF SUCH A VILE INTRIGUE IN HIS WAY TO HARLOWE PLACE
6660-103629-0006 WOULD IT NOT HAVE HAD SUCH AN EFFECT UPON YOU THEN THE REAL GENEROSITY OF THE ACT I PROTEST MY BELOVED FRIEND IF HE WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE FROM THIS TIME I WOULD FORGIVE HIM A GREAT MANY OF HIS PAST ERRORS WERE IT ONLY FOR THE DEMONSTRATION HE HAS GIVEN IN THIS
6660-103629-0007 THAT HE IS CAPABLE OF SO GOOD AND BOUNTIFUL A MANNER OF THINKING YOU MAY BELIEVE I MADE NO SCRUPLE TO OPEN HIS LETTER AFTER THE RECEIPT OF YOUR SECOND ON THIS SUBJECT NOR SHALL I OF ANSWERING IT AS I HAVE NO REASON TO FIND FAULT WITH IT AN ARTICLE IN HIS FAVOUR PROCURED HIM HOWEVER
6660-103629-0008 SO MUCH THE EASIER I MUST OWN BY WAY OF AMENDS FOR THE UNDUE DISPLEASURE I TOOK AGAINST HIM THOUGH HE KNOWS IT NOT IS IT LUCKY ENOUGH THAT THIS MATTER WAS CLEARED UP TO ME BY YOUR FRIENDLY DILIGENCE SO SOON FOR HAD I WRITTEN BEFORE IT WAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO REINFORCE MY DISMISSION OF HIM
6660-103629-0009 COME FOR MY LETTER IN PERSON AND THE FORWARD CREATURE LABOURS THE POINT AS IF HE THOUGHT I SHOULD BE UNEASY THAT HE DID NOT I AM INDEED SORRY HE SHOULD BE ILL ON MY ACCOUNT AND I WILL ALLOW THAT THE SUSPENSE HE HAS BEEN IN FOR SOME TIME PAST MUST HAVE BEEN VEXATIOUS ENOUGH
6660-103629-0010 TO SO IMPATIENT A SPIRIT BUT ALL IS OWING ORIGINALLY TO HIMSELF YOU WILL FIND HIM IN THE PRESUMPTION OF BEING FORGIVEN FULL OF CONTRIVANCES AND EXPEDIENTS FOR MY ESCAPING MY THREATENED COMPULSION I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT NEXT TO BEING WITHOUT FAULT
6660-103629-0011 THAT HIS HUMILITY IS HUMILITY OR EVEN AN HUMILITY UPON SUCH CONVICTION AS ONE SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH TO BE SURE HE IS FAR FROM BEING A POLITE MAN YET IS NOT DIRECTLY AND CHARACTERISTICALLY AS I MAY SAY UNPOLITE
6660-103629-0012 BUT HIS IS SUCH A SORT OF POLITENESS AS HAS BY A CARELESSNESS FOUNDED ON VERY EARLY INDULGENCE AND PERHAPS ON TOO MUCH SUCCESS IN RIPER YEARS AND AN ARROGANCE BUILT UPON BOTH GROWN INTO ASSUREDNESS
6660-103629-0013 AND OF COURSE I MAY SAY INTO INDELICACY THE DISTANCE YOU RECOMMEND AT WHICH TO KEEP THESE MEN IS CERTAINLY RIGHT IN THE MAIN FAMILIARITY DESTROYS REVERENCE BUT WITH WHOM NOT WITH THOSE SURELY WHO ARE PRUDENT GRATEFUL AND GENEROUS
6660-103629-0014 BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR PERSONS WHO WOULD AVOID RUNNING INTO ONE EXTREME TO KEEP CLEAR OF ANOTHER HENCE MISTER LOVELACE PERHAPS THINKS IT THE MARK OF A GREAT SPIRIT TO HUMOUR HIS PRIDE THOUGH AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS POLITENESS BUT CAN THE MAN BE A DEEP MAN
6660-103629-0015 WHO KNOWS NOT HOW TO MAKE SUCH DISTINCTIONS AS A PERSON OF BUT MODERATE PARTS CANNOT MISS HE COMPLAINS HEAVILY OF MY READINESS TO TAKE MORTAL OFFENCE AT HIM AND TO DISMISS HIM FOR EVER IT IS A HIGH CONDUCT HE SAYS HE MUST BE FRANK ENOUGH TO TELL ME
6660-103629-0016 A CONDUCT THAT MUST BE VERY FAR FROM CONTRIBUTING TO ALLAY HIS APPREHENSIONS OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT I MAY BE PROSECUTED INTO MY RELATIONS MEASURES IN BEHALF OF MISTER SOLMES YOU WILL SEE HOW HE PUTS HIS PRESENT AND HIS FUTURE HAPPINESS WITH REGARD TO BOTH WORLDS ENTIRELY UPON ME
6660-103629-0017 THE ARDOUR WITH WHICH HE VOWS AND PROMISES I THINK THE HEART ONLY CAN DICTATE HOW ELSE CAN ONE GUESS AT A MAN'S HEART
6660-103629-0018 THAT HE HAS ALREADY HEARD OF THE INTERVIEW I AM TO HAVE WITH MISTER SOLMES AND WITH WHAT VEHEMENCE AND ANGUISH HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF ON THE OCCASION I INTEND TO TAKE PROPER NOTICE OF THE IGNOBLE MEANS HE STOOPS TO TO COME AT HIS EARLY INTELLIGENCE OF OUR FAMILY IF PERSONS PRETENDING TO PRINCIPLE
6660-103629-0019 BEAR NOT THEIR TESTIMONY AGAINST UNPRINCIPLED ACTIONS WHAT CHECK CAN THEY HAVE YOU WILL SEE HOW PASSIONATELY HE PRESSES ME TO OBLIGE HIM WITH A FEW LINES BEFORE THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN MISTER SOLMES AND ME TAKES PLACE IF AS HE SAYS IT MUST TAKE PLACE TO CONFIRM HIS HOPE
6660-103629-0020 THAT I HAVE NO VIEW IN MY PRESENT DISPLEASURE AGAINST HIM TO GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT TO SOLMES AN APPREHENSION HE SAYS THAT HE MUST BE EXCUSED FOR REPEATING ESPECIALLY AS THE INTERVIEW IS A FAVOUR GRANTED TO THAT MAN WHICH I HAVE REFUSED TO HIM SINCE AS HE INFERS
6660-103629-0021 WERE IT NOT WITH SUCH AN EXPECTATION WHY SHOULD MY FRIENDS PRESS IT I HAVE WRITTEN AND TO THIS EFFECT THAT I HAD NEVER INTENDED TO WRITE ANOTHER LINE TO A MAN WHO COULD TAKE UPON HIMSELF TO REFLECT UPON MY SEX AND MYSELF FOR HAVING THOUGHT FIT TO MAKE USE OF MY OWN JUDGMENT
6660-103629-0022 I TELL HIM THAT I HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE INTERVIEW WITH MISTER SOLMES PURELY AS AN ACT OF DUTY TO SHEW MY FRIENDS THAT I WILL COMPLY WITH THEIR COMMANDS AS FAR AS I CAN AND THAT I HOPE WHEN MISTER SOLMES HIMSELF SHALL SEE HOW DETERMINED I AM HE WILL CEASE TO PROSECUTE A SUIT
6660-103629-0023 IN WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE HE SHOULD SUCCEED WITH MY CONSENT I ASSURE HIM THAT MY AVERSION TO MISTER SOLMES IS TOO SINCERE TO PERMIT ME TO DOUBT MYSELF ON THIS OCCASION BUT NEVERTHELESS HE MUST NOT IMAGINE THAT MY REJECTING OF MISTER SOLMES IS IN FAVOUR TO HIM
6660-103629-0024 THAT I VALUE MY FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCY TOO MUCH IF MY FRIENDS WILL BUT LEAVE ME TO MY OWN JUDGMENT TO GIVE THEM UP TO A MAN SO UNCONTROULABLE AND WHO SHEWS ME BEFOREHAND WHAT I HAVE TO EXPECT FROM HIM WERE I IN HIS POWER
6660-103629-0025 AND NO MORE THAN AN ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY ONE MEANNESS BY ANOTHER THERE IS I OBSERVE TO HIM A RIGHT AND A WRONG IN EVERY THING LET PEOPLE PUT WHAT GLOSSES THEY PLEASE UPON THEIR ACTION TO CONDEMN A DEVIATION AND TO FOLLOW IT BY AS GREAT A ONE WHAT I ASK HIM IS THIS
6660-103629-0026 BUT PROPAGATING A GENERAL CORRUPTION A STAND MUST BE MADE SOMEBODY TURN ROUND THE EVIL AS MANY AS MAY OR VIRTUE WILL BE LOST AND SHALL IT NOT BE I A WORTHY MIND WOULD ASK THAT SHALL MAKE THIS STAND I LEAVE HIM TO JUDGE WHETHER HIS BE A WORTHY ONE
6660-103629-0027 TRIED BY THIS RULE AND WHETHER KNOWING THE IMPETUOSITY OF HIS OWN DISPOSITION AND THE IMPROBABILITY THERE IS THAT MY FATHER AND FAMILY WILL EVER BE RECONCILED TO HIM
6660-103629-0028 THESE SPOTS AND BLEMISHES I FURTHER TELL HIM GIVE ME NOT EARNESTNESS ENOUGH FOR ANY SAKE BUT HIS OWN TO WISH HIM IN A JUSTER AND NOBLER TRAIN OF THINKING AND ACTING FOR THAT I TRULY DESPISED MANY OF THE WAYS HE ALLOWS HIMSELF IN OUR MINDS ARE THEREFORE INFINITELY DIFFERENT
6660-103629-0029 AND AS TO HIS PROFESSIONS OF REFORMATION I MUST TELL HIM THAT PROFUSE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS WITHOUT AMENDMENT ARE BUT TO ME AS SO MANY ANTICIPATING CONCESSIONS WHICH HE MAY FIND MUCH EASIER TO MAKE THANE EITHER TO DEFEND HIMSELF OR AMEND HIS ERRORS
6660-103629-0030 AND SO I HAVE BY BETTY AND SHE BY MY BROTHER WITH THE WEAK AND WANTON AIRS HE GIVES HIMSELF OF DECLAIMING AGAINST MATRIMONY I SEVERELY REPREHEND HIM ON THIS OCCASION AND ASK HIM WITH WHAT VIEW HE CAN TAKE SO WITLESS SO DESPICABLE A LIBERTY
6660-103629-0031 IN WHICH ONLY THE MOST ABANDONED OF MEN ALLOW THEMSELVES AND YET PRESUME TO ADDRESS ME I TELL HIM THAT IF I AM OBLIGED TO GO TO MY UNCLE ANTONY'S IT IS NOT TO BE INFERRED THAT I MUST THEREFORE NECESSARILY BE MISTER SOLMES'S WIFE
6660-103629-0032 THAT THE SAME EXCEPTIONS LIE SO STRONGLY AGAINST MY QUITTING A HOUSE TO WHICH I SHALL BE FORCIBLY CARRIED AS IF I LEFT MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND AT THE WORST I MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM IN SUSPENSE TILL MY COUSIN MORDEN COMES WHO WILL HAVE A RIGHT TO PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF MY GRANDFATHER'S ESTATE
6660-103629-0033 IF I INSIST UPON IT THIS I DOUBT IS SOMEWHAT OF AN ARTIFICE WHICH CAN ONLY BE EXCUSABLE AS IT IS PRINCIPALLY DESIGNED TO KEEP HIM OUT OF MISCHIEF FOR I HAVE BUT LITTLE HOPE IF CARRIED THITHER WHETHER SENSIBLE OR SENSELESS ABSOLUTELY IF I AM LEFT TO THE MERCY OF MY BROTHER AND SISTER
6660-103629-0034 BUT THEY WILL ENDEAVOUR TO FORCE THE SOLEMN OBLIGATION UPON ME OTHERWISE WERE THERE BUT ANY PROSPECT OF AVOIDING THIS BY DELAYING OR EVEN BY TAKING THINGS TO MAKE ME ILL IF NOTHING ELSE WOULD DO TILL MY COUSIN COMES I HOPE I SHOULD NOT THINK OF LEAVING EVEN MY UNCLE'S HOUSE
6660-103629-0035 FOR I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO SQUARE IT TO MY OWN PRINCIPLES TO DISPENSE WITH THE DUTY I OWE TO MY FATHER WHEREVER IT SHALL BE HIS WILL TO PLACE ME BUT WHILE YOU GIVE ME THE CHARMING HOPE THAT IN ORDER TO AVOID ONE MAN I SHALL NOT BE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF THROWING MYSELF UPON THE FRIENDS OF THE OTHER
6660-103629-0036 I THINK MY CASE NOT DESPERATE I SEE NOT ANY OF MY FAMILY NOR HEAR FROM THEM IN ANY WAY OF KINDNESS THIS LOOKS AS IF THEY THEMSELVES EXPECTED NO GREAT MATTERS FROM THE TUESDAY'S CONFERENCE WHICH MAKES MY HEART FLUTTER EVERY TIME I THINK OF IT
6660-103629-0037 MY UNCLE ANTONY'S PRESENCE ON THE OCCASION I DO NOT MUCH LIKE BUT I HAD RATHER MEET HIM THAN MY BROTHER OR SISTER YET MY UNCLE IS VERY IMPETUOUS I CAN'T THINK MISTER LOVELACE CAN BE MUCH MORE SO
6660-103629-0038 AT LEAST HE CANNOT LOOK ANGRY AS MY UNCLE WITH HIS HARDER FEATURES CAN THESE SEA PROSPERED GENTLEMEN AS MY UNCLE HAS OFTEN MADE ME THINK NOT USED TO ANY BUT ELEMENTAL CONTROUL AND EVEN READY TO BUFFET THAT BLUSTER OFTEN AS VIOLENTLY AS THE WINDS THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BE ANGRY AT
6660-103629-0039 WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FALL IN WITH A CHOICE YOUR MOTHER HAS MADE FOR YOU TO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT NOR CAN HAVE A JUST OBJECTION EXCEPT THE FROWARDNESS OF OUR SEX AS OUR FREE CENSURERS WOULD PERHAPS TAKE THE LIBERTY TO SAY MAKES IT ONE THAT THE CHOICE WAS YOUR MOTHER'S AT FIRST HAND
6660-103629-0040 PERVERSE NATURE WE KNOW LOVES NOT TO BE PRESCRIBED TO ALTHOUGH YOUTH IS NOT SO WELL QUALIFIED EITHER BY SEDATENESS OR EXPERIENCE TO CHOOSE FOR ITSELF TO KNOW YOUR OWN HAPPINESS AND THAT IT IS NOW
6660-103629-0041 NOR TO LEAVE IT TO AFTER REFLECTION TO LOOK BACK UPON THE PREFERABLE PAST WITH A HEAVY AND SELF ACCUSING HEART THAT YOU DID NOT CHOOSE IT WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN IT IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE YOUR FELICITY AND THIS POWER IS WISHED YOU BY
