207-122801-0000 THE BELL PEOPLE SAID THE EVENING BELL IS SOUNDING THE SUN IS SETTING FOR A STRANGE WONDROUS TONE WAS HEARD IN THE NARROW STREETS OF A LARGE TOWN IT WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF A CHURCH BELL BUT IT WAS ONLY HEARD FOR A MOMENT
207-122801-0001 FOR THE ROLLING OF THE CARRIAGES AND THE VOICES OF THE MULTITUDE MADE TOO GREAT A NOISE
207-122801-0002 WHERE THE HOUSES WERE FARTHER APART WITH GARDENS OR LITTLE FIELDS BETWEEN THEM COULD SEE THE EVENING SKY STILL BETTER AND HEARD THE SOUND OF THE BELL MUCH MORE DISTINCTLY IT WAS AS IF THE TONES CAME FROM A CHURCH IN THE STILL FOREST PEOPLE LOOKED THITHERWARD
207-122801-0003 AND FELT THEIR MINDS ATTUNED MOST SOLEMNLY A LONG TIME PASSED AND PEOPLE SAID TO EACH OTHER I WONDER IF THERE IS A CHURCH OUT IN THE WOOD THE BELL HAS A TONE THAT IS WONDROUS SWEET LET US STROLL THITHER AND EXAMINE THE MATTER NEARER
207-122801-0004 AND THE RICH PEOPLE DROVE OUT AND THE POOR WALKED BUT THE WAY SEEMED STRANGELY LONG TO THEM AND WHEN THEY CAME TO A CLUMP OF WILLOWS WHICH GREW ON THE SKIRTS OF THE FOREST THEY SAT DOWN
207-122801-0005 AND FANCIED THEY WERE NOW IN THE DEPTH OF THE GREEN WOOD THE CONFECTIONER OF THE TOWN CAME OUT AND SET UP HIS BOOTH THERE AND SOON AFTER CAME ANOTHER CONFECTIONER
207-122801-0006 THERE WERE THREE PERSONS WHO ASSERTED THEY HAD PENETRATED TO THE END OF THE FOREST
207-122801-0007 BUT IT HAD SEEMED TO THEM AS IF IT HAD COME FROM THE TOWN
207-122801-0008 AND SAID THE BELL SOUNDED LIKE THE VOICE OF A MOTHER TO A GOOD DEAR CHILD AND THAT NO MELODY WAS SWEETER THAN THE TONES OF THE BELL THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO OBSERVANT OF IT AND VOWED THAT HE WHO COULD DISCOVER WHENCE THE SOUNDS PROCEEDED
207-122801-0009 SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER EVEN IF IT WERE NOT REALLY A BELL MANY PERSONS NOW WENT TO THE WOOD FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE PLACE
207-122801-0010 FOR NOBODY WENT FAR ENOUGH THAT ONE NOT FURTHER THAN THE OTHERS HOWEVER HE SAID THAT THE SOUND PROCEEDED FROM A VERY LARGE OWL IN A HOLLOW TREE A SORT OF LEARNED OWL THAT CONTINUALLY KNOCKED ITS HEAD AGAINST THE BRANCHES
207-122801-0011 BUT WHETHER THE SOUND CAME FROM HIS HEAD OR FROM THE HOLLOW TREE THAT NO ONE COULD SAY WITH CERTAINTY SO NOW HE GOT THE PLACE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER AND WROTE YEARLY A SHORT TREATISE ON THE OWL
207-122801-0012 FROM CHILDREN THEY BECOME ALL AT ONCE GROWN UP PERSONS IT WAS AS IF THEIR INFANT SOULS WERE NOW TO FLY ALL AT ONCE INTO PERSONS WITH MORE UNDERSTANDING THE SUN WAS SHINING GLORIOUSLY THE CHILDREN THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WENT OUT OF THE TOWN
207-122801-0013 AND FROM THE WOOD WAS BORNE TOWARDS THEM THE SOUNDS OF THE UNKNOWN BELL WITH WONDERFUL DISTINCTNESS THEY ALL IMMEDIATELY FELT A WISH TO GO THITHER ALL EXCEPT THREE ONE OF THEM HAD TO GO HOME TO TRY ON A BALL DRESS
207-122801-0014 FOR OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE COME THE OTHER WAS A POOR BOY WHO HAD BORROWED HIS COAT AND BOOTS TO BE CONFIRMED IN FROM THE INNKEEPER'S SON
207-122801-0015 BUT TWO OF THE YOUNGEST SOON GREW TIRED AND BOTH RETURNED TO TOWN TWO LITTLE GIRLS SAT DOWN AND TWINED GARLANDS SO THEY DID NOT GO EITHER AND WHEN THE OTHERS REACHED THE WILLOW TREE WHERE THE CONFECTIONER WAS THEY SAID NOW WE ARE THERE
207-122801-0016 WOODROOF AND ANEMONIES GREW ALMOST TOO HIGH BLOOMING CONVOLVULUSES AND BLACKBERRY BUSHES HUNG IN LONG GARLANDS FROM TREE TO TREE WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE SANG AND THE SUNBEAMS WERE PLAYING IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS NO PLACE FOR GIRLS TO GO
207-122801-0017 THEIR CLOTHES WOULD GET SO TORN LARGE BLOCKS OF STONE LAY THERE OVERGROWN WITH MOSS OF EVERY COLOR THE FRESH SPRING BUBBLED FORTH AND MADE A STRANGE GURGLING SOUND THAT SURELY CANNOT BE THE BELL SAID ONE OF THE CHILDREN LYING DOWN AND LISTENING
207-122801-0018 THIS MUST BE LOOKED TO SO HE REMAINED AND LET THE OTHERS GO ON WITHOUT HIM THEY AFTERWARDS CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE MADE OF BRANCHES AND THE BARK OF TREES A LARGE WILD APPLE TREE BENT OVER IT
207-122801-0019 AS IF IT WOULD SHOWER DOWN ALL ITS BLESSINGS ON THE ROOF WHERE ROSES WERE BLOOMING THE LONG STEMS TWINED ROUND THE GABLE ON WHICH THERE HUNG A SMALL BELL WAS IT THAT WHICH PEOPLE HAD HEARD YES EVERYBODY WAS UNANIMOUS ON THE SUBJECT EXCEPT ONE
207-122801-0020 HIS BREAST WAS FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE FOREST SOLITUDE BUT HE STILL HEARD THE LITTLE BELL WITH WHICH THE OTHERS WERE SO SATISFIED AND NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND BLEW HE COULD ALSO HEAR THE PEOPLE SINGING WHO WERE SITTING AT TEA WHERE THE CONFECTIONER HAD HIS TENT
207-122801-0021 BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER IT WAS ALMOST AS IF AN ORGAN WERE ACCOMPANYING IT AND THE TONES CAME FROM THE LEFT HAND THE SIDE WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED A RUSTLING WAS HEARD IN THE BUSHES AND A LITTLE BOY STOOD BEFORE THE KING'S SON
207-122801-0022 A BOY IN WOODEN SHOES AND WITH SO SHORT A JACKET THAT ONE COULD SEE WHAT LONG WRISTS HE HAD BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THE BOY WAS THAT ONE AMONG THE CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT COME BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO HOME AND RETURN HIS JACKET AND BOOTS TO THE INNKEEPER'S SON
207-122801-0023 THIS HE HAD DONE AND WAS NOW GOING ON IN WOODEN SHOES AND IN HIS HUMBLE DRESS FOR THE BELL SOUNDED WITH SO DEEP A TONE AND WITH SUCH STRANGE POWER THAT PROCEED HE MUST
207-122801-0024 BUT THE POOR CHILD THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WAS QUITE ASHAMED HE LOOKED AT HIS WOODEN SHOES PULLED AT THE SHORT SLEEVES OF HIS JACKET AND SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID HE COULD NOT WALK SO FAST BESIDES HE THOUGHT THAT THE BELL MUST BE LOOKED FOR TO THE RIGHT
207-122801-0025 FOR THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE ALL SORTS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS WERE TO BE FOUND BUT THERE WE SHALL NOT MEET SAID THE KING'S SON NODDING AT THE SAME TIME TO THE POOR BOY WHO WENT INTO THE DARKEST THICKEST PART OF THE WOOD WHERE THORNS TORE HIS HUMBLE DRESS
207-122801-0026 AND SCRATCHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND FEET TILL THEY BLED THE KING'S SON GOT SOME SCRATCHES TOO BUT THE SUN SHONE ON HIS PATH
207-122801-0027 FOR HE WAS AN EXCELLENT AND RESOLUTE YOUTH
207-122801-0028 HE IS THE SON OF A KING BUT ON HE WENT WITHOUT BEING DISHEARTENED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS WERE GROWING THERE STOOD WHITE LILIES WITH BLOOD RED STAMINA
207-122801-0029 SKYBLUE TULIPS WHICH SHONE AS THEY WAVED IN THE WINDS AND APPLE TREES THE APPLES OF WHICH LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE LARGE SOAPBUBBLES SO ONLY THINK HOW THE TREES MUST HAVE SPARKLED IN THE SUNSHINE AROUND THE NICEST GREEN MEADS
207-122801-0030 WHERE THE DEER WERE PLAYING IN THE GRASS GREW MAGNIFICENT OAKS AND BEECHES AND IF THE BARK OF ONE OF THE TREES WAS CRACKED THERE GRASS AND LONG CREEPING PLANTS GREW IN THE CREVICES AND THERE WERE LARGE CALM LAKES THERE TOO
207-122801-0031 IN WHICH WHITE SWANS WERE SWIMMING AND BEAT THE AIR WITH THEIR WINGS THE KING'S SON OFTEN STOOD STILL AND LISTENED HE THOUGHT THE BELL SOUNDED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THESE STILL LAKES BUT THEN HE REMARKED AGAIN THAT THE TONE PROCEEDED NOT FROM THERE
207-122801-0032 SUNG HIS EVENING HYMN AND SAID I CANNOT FIND WHAT I SEEK THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND NIGHT IS COMING THE DARK DARK NIGHT YET PERHAPS I MAY BE ABLE ONCE MORE TO SEE THE ROUND RED SUN BEFORE HE ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS
207-122801-0033 I WILL CLIMB UP YONDER ROCK AND HE SEIZED HOLD OF THE CREEPING PLANTS AND THE ROOTS OF TREES CLIMBED UP THE MOIST STONES WHERE THE WATER SNAKES WERE WRITHING AND THE TOADS WERE CROAKING
207-122801-0034 ALL NATURE WAS A VAST HOLY CHURCH IN WHICH THE TREES AND THE BUOYANT CLOUDS WERE THE PILLARS FLOWERS AND GRASS THE VELVET CARPETING AND HEAVEN ITSELF THE LARGE CUPOLA
207-122801-0035 THE RED COLORS ABOVE FADED AWAY AS THE SUN VANISHED BUT A MILLION STARS WERE LIGHTED A MILLION LAMPS SHONE
207-122801-0036 AND WOOD AND SEA
207-122801-0037 APPEARED IN HIS WOODEN SHOES AND JACKET THE POOR BOY WHO HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WITH HIM HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS OWN PATH AND HAD REACHED THE SPOT JUST AS SOON AS THE SON OF THE KING HAD DONE THEY RAN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND STOOD TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
207-122801-0038 IN THE VAST CHURCH OF NATURE AND OF POETRY WHILE OVER THEM SOUNDED THE INVISIBLE HOLY BELL
