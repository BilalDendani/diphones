3923-174992-0000 IN THESE FINE EARLY AUTUMN DAYS SPENT AT MATCHING THE GREAT TRUMPETON WOOD QUESTION WAS AT LAST SETTLED DURING THE SUMMER CONSIDERABLE ACERBITY HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE MATTER BY CERTAIN ARTICLES WHICH HAD APPEARED IN CERTAIN SPORTING PAPERS
3923-174992-0001 IN WHICH THE NEW DUKE OF OMNIUM WAS ACCUSED OF NEGLECTING HIS DUTY TO THE COUNTY IN WHICH A PORTION OF HIS PROPERTY LAY THE QUESTION WAS ARGUED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH IS A LANDED PROPRIETOR BOUND OR IS HE NOT TO KEEP FOXES FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF HIS NEIGHBOURS
3923-174992-0002 TO ORDINARY THINKERS TO UNPREJUDICED OUTSIDERS TO AMERICANS LET US SAY OR FRENCHMEN THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ROOM EVEN FOR AN ARGUMENT BY WHAT LAW OF GOD OR MAN CAN A MAN BE BOUND TO MAINTAIN A PARCEL OF INJURIOUS VERMIN ON HIS PROPERTY
3923-174992-0003 IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE FINDS NO SPORT HIMSELF AND WHICH ARE HIGHLY DETRIMENTAL TO ANOTHER SPORT IN WHICH HE TAKES PERHAPS THE KEENEST INTEREST TRUMPETON WOOD WAS THE DUKE'S OWN TO DO JUST AS HE PLEASED WITH IT WHY SHOULD FOXES BE DEMANDED FROM HIM THEN
3923-174992-0004 ANY MORE THAN A BEAR TO BE BAITED OR A BADGER TO BE DRAWN IN LET US SAY HIS LONDON DINING ROOM BUT A GOOD DEAL HAD BEEN SAID WHICH THOUGH NOT PERHAPS CAPABLE OF CONVINCING THE UNPREJUDICED AMERICAN OR FRENCHMAN HAD BEEN REGARDED AS COGENT ARGUMENTS TO COUNTRY BRED ENGLISHMEN
3923-174992-0005 MANY THINGS ARE NO DOUBT PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE LAW WHICH IF DONE WOULD SHOW THE DOER OF THEM TO BE THE ENEMY OF HIS SPECIES AND THIS DESTRUCTION OF FOXES IN A HUNTING COUNTRY MAY BE NAMED AS ONE OF THEM THE DUKE MIGHT HAVE HIS FOXES DESTROYED IF HE PLEASED
3923-174992-0006 BUT HE COULD HARDLY DO SO AND REMAIN A POPULAR MAGNATE IN ENGLAND IF HE CHOSE TO PUT HIMSELF IN OPPOSITION TO THE DESIRES AND VERY INSTINCTS OF THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM HIS PROPERTY WAS SITUATED HE MUST LIVE AS A MAN FORBID THAT WAS THE GENERAL ARGUMENT
3923-174992-0007 AND THEN THERE WAS THE ARGUMENT SPECIAL TO THIS PARTICULAR CASE AS IT HAPPENED TRUMPETON WOOD WAS AND ALWAYS HAD BEEN THE GREAT NURSERY OF FOXES FOR THAT SIDE OF THE BRAKE COUNTRY GORSE COVERTS MAKE NO DOUBT THE CHARM OF HUNTING
3923-174992-0008 IF ALL FOXES SO WANDERING BE DOOMED TO DEATH IF POISON AND WIRES AND TRAPS AND HOSTILE KEEPERS AWAIT THEM THERE INSTEAD OF THE TENDER WELCOME OF THE LOVING FOX PRESERVER
3923-174992-0009 AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL BE AFFLICTED WITH A WILD DISMAY ALL WHICH LORD CHILTERN UNDERSTOOD WELL WHEN HE BECAME SO LOUD IN HIS COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DUKE BUT OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND ONLY THE OTHER DAY A DUKE PLANTY PALL AS HE WAS LATELY CALLED
3923-174992-0010 DEVOTED TO WORK AND TO PARLIAMENT AN UNSELFISH FRIENDLY WISE MAN WHO BY NO MEANS WANTED OTHER MEN TO CUT THEIR COATS ACCORDING TO HIS PATTERN WAS THE LAST MAN IN ENGLAND TO PUT HIMSELF FORWARD AS THE ENEMY OF AN ESTABLISHED DELIGHT HE DID NOT HUNT HIMSELF
3923-174992-0011 BUT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS HIMSELF PECULIAR AND HE RESPECTED THE HABITS OF OTHERS IT HAD FALLEN OUT IN THIS WISE AS THE OLD DUKE HAD BECOME VERY OLD
3923-174992-0012 OR PAY ATTENTION TO THE SHOOTING AND AS THE DUKE WOULD NOT LET THE SHOOTING OF HIS WOOD MISTER FOTHERGILL THE STEWARD HAD GRADUALLY BECOME OMNIPOTENT NOW MISTER FOTHERGILL WAS NOT A HUNTING MAN BUT THE MISCHIEF DID NOT AT ALL LIE THERE LORD CHILTERN WOULD NOT COMMUNICATE WITH MISTER FOTHERGILL
3923-174992-0013 LORD CHILTERN WOULD WRITE TO THE DUKE AND MISTER FOTHERGILL BECAME AN ESTABLISHED ENEMY
3923-174992-0014 THERE IS SOMETHING DOUBTLESS ABSURD IN THE INTENSITY OF THE WORSHIP PAID TO THE FOX BY HUNTING COMMUNITIES THE ANIMAL BECOMES SACRED AND HIS PRESERVATION IS A RELIGION HIS IRREGULAR DESTRUCTION IS A PROFANITY AND WORDS SPOKEN TO HIS INJURY ARE BLASPHEMOUS
3923-174992-0015 NOT LONG SINCE A GENTLEMAN SHOT A FOX RUNNING ACROSS A WOODLAND RIDE IN A HUNTING COUNTRY HE HAD MISTAKEN IT FOR A HARE AND HAD DONE THE DEED IN THE PRESENCE OF KEEPERS OWNER AND FRIENDS
3923-174992-0016 HOPING THAT IN SPITE OF THE SACRILEGE COMMITTED HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FACE A WORLD THAT WOULD BE IGNORANT OF HIS CRIME AS THE VULPICIDE ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE DAY OF THE DEED WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO HIS ROOM ONE MAID SERVANT WHISPERED TO ANOTHER AND THE POOR VICTIM OF AN IMPERFECT SIGHT
3923-174992-0017 HEARD THE WORDS THAT'S HE AS SHOT THE FOX THE GENTLEMAN DID NOT APPEAR AT DINNER NOR WAS HE EVER AGAIN SEEN IN THOSE PARTS MISTER FOTHERGILL HAD BECOME ANGRY LORD CHILTERN AS WE KNOW HAD BEEN VERY ANGRY AND EVEN THE DUKE WAS ANGRY
3923-174992-0018 THE DUKE WAS ANGRY BECAUSE LORD CHILTERN HAD BEEN VIOLENT AND LORD CHILTERN HAD BEEN VIOLENT BECAUSE MISTER FOTHERGILL'S CONDUCT HAD BEEN TO HIS THINKING NOT ONLY SACRILEGIOUS BUT ONE CONTINUED COURSE OF WILFUL SACRILEGE
3923-174992-0019 TO KILL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FOXES IN THE YEAR AFTER THE LEGITIMATE FASHION HAD BECOME TO HIM THE ONE GREAT STUDY OF LIFE AND HE DID IT WITH AN ENERGY EQUAL TO THAT WHICH THE DUKE DEVOTED TO DECIMAL COINAGE HIS HUNTSMAN WAS ALWAYS WELL MOUNTED WITH TWO HORSES
3923-174992-0020 BUT LORD CHILTERN WOULD GIVE UP HIS OWN TO THE MAN AND TAKE CHARGE OF A WEARY ANIMAL AS A COMMON GROOM WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE MIGHT THUS FURTHER THE OBJECT OF THE DAY'S SPORT HE WORKED AS MEN WORK ONLY AT PLEASURE HE NEVER MISSED A DAY
3923-174992-0021 EVEN WHEN CUB HUNTING REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE HIS BED AT THREE A M HE WAS CONSTANT AT HIS KENNEL
3923-174992-0022 THE DUKE'S PROPERTY INDEED SURELY ALL THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD IN ENGLAND BY THIS TIME NOW HE HAD CONSENTED TO COME TO MATCHING BRINGING HIS WIFE WITH HIM IN ORDER THAT THE MATTER MIGHT BE SETTLED THERE HAD BEEN A THREAT THAT HE WOULD GIVE UP THE COUNTRY
3923-174992-0023 IN WHICH CASE IT WAS DECLARED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY ON THE BRAKE HUNT IN A MANNER SATISFACTORY TO MASTERS SUBSCRIBERS OWNERS OF COVERTS OR FARMERS UNLESS A DIFFERENT ORDER OF THINGS SHOULD BE MADE TO PREVAIL IN REGARD TO TRUMPETON WOOD
3923-174992-0024 THE DUKE HOWEVER HAD DECLINED TO INTERFERE PERSONALLY HE HAD TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO WELCOME LORD AND LADY CHILTERN AS HE WOULD ANY OTHER FRIENDS OF HERS THE GUESTS INDEED AT THE DUKE'S HOUSE WERE NEVER HIS GUESTS BUT ALWAYS HERS
3923-174992-0025 BUT HE COULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE BROUGHT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH LORD CHILTERN AS TO THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OWN PROPERTY THE DUCHESS WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE MUST PREVENT ANY SUCH AWKWARDNESS AND SHE DID PREVENT IT AND NOW LORD CHILTERN SHE SAID HOW ABOUT THE FOXES
3923-174992-0026 LADY CHILTERN AND MADAME GOESLER WERE PRESENT AND ALSO PHINEAS FINN WELL HOW ABOUT THEM SAID THE LORD
3923-174992-0027 THAT THOUGH THE MATTER HAD BEEN INTRODUCED SOMEWHAT JOCOSELY THERE COULD NOT REALLY BE ANY JOKE ABOUT IT WHY COULDN'T YOU KEEP IT ALL OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS I DON'T WRITE THE NEWSPAPERS DUCHESS I CAN'T HELP THE NEWSPAPERS WHEN TWO HUNDRED MEN RIDE THROUGH TRUMPETON WOOD AND SEE ONE FOX FOUND
3923-174992-0028 WE MAY HAVE TRAPS IF WE LIKE IT LORD CHILTERN CERTAINLY ONLY SAY SO AND WE SHALL KNOW WHERE WE ARE HE LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND POOR LADY CHILTERN WAS COVERED WITH DISMAY THE DUKE CAN DESTROY THE HUNT IF HE PLEASES NO DOUBT SAID THE LORD BUT WE DON'T LIKE TRAPS LORD CHILTERN
3923-174992-0029 I'D GO AND NURSE THE FOXES MYSELF IF I KNEW HOW WOULDN'T I MARIE THEY HAVE ROBBED THE DUCHESS OF HER SLEEP FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS SAID MADAME GOESLER AND IF THEY GO ON BEING NOT PROPERLY BROUGHT UP AND EDUCATED THEY'LL MAKE AN OLD WOMAN OF ME
3923-174992-0030 AS FOR THE DUKE HE CAN'T BE COMFORTABLE IN HIS ARITHMETIC FOR THINKING OF THEM BUT WHAT CAN ONE DO
3923-174992-0031 TO WHOM CAN I APPLY TO APPOINT OTHERS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT VESTED INTERESTS MEAN LORD CHILTERN THEN NOBODY CAN MANAGE HIS OWN PROPERTY AS HE PLEASES NOBODY CAN UNLESS HE DOES THE WORK HIMSELF IF I WERE TO GO AND LIVE IN TRUMPETON WOOD I COULD DO IT BUT YOU SEE I HAVE TO LIVE HERE
3923-174992-0032 I VOTE THAT WE HAVE AN OFFICER OF STATE TO GO IN AND OUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH A SEAT IN THE CABINET OR NOT ACCORDING AS THINGS GO
3923-174992-0033 THEN I SUPPOSE THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE SAID LORD CHILTERN MY DEAR LORD CHILTERN EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE VESTED INTERESTS HAVE BEEN ATTENDED TO KEEPERS SHALL PREFER FOXES TO PHEASANTS WIRES SHALL BE UNHEARD OF
3923-174992-0034 AND TRUMPETON WOOD SHALL ONCE AGAIN BE THE GLORY OF THE BRAKE HUNT
3923-174992-0035 I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY INDEED TO PUT THE DUKE TO ANY UNNECESSARY EXPENSE SAID LORD CHILTERN SOLEMNLY STILL FEARING THAT THE DUCHESS WAS ONLY PLAYING WITH HIM IT MADE HIM ANGRY THAT HE COULD NOT IMBUE OTHER PEOPLE WITH HIS IDEA OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMUSEMENT OF A WHOLE COUNTY
3923-174992-0036 AND SO THE GREAT MISTER FOTHERGILL FALLS FROM POWER AND GOES DOWN INTO OBSCURITY SAID MADAME GOESLER HE WAS AN IMPUDENT OLD MAN AND THAT'S THE TRUTH SAID THE DUCHESS AND HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY THOROUGH DETESTATION
3923-174992-0037 ON THE NEXT DAY LORD AND LADY CHILTERN WENT BACK TO HARRINGTON HALL WHEN THE END OF AUGUST COMES A MASTER OF HOUNDS WHO IS REALLY A MASTER IS WANTED AT HOME
3923-174992-0038 NOTHING SHORT OF AN EMBASSY ON BEHALF OF THE GREAT COVERTS OF HIS COUNTRY WOULD HAVE KEPT THIS MASTER AWAY AT PRESENT AND NOW HIS DIPLOMACY HAVING SUCCEEDED HE HURRIED BACK TO MAKE THE MOST OF ITS RESULTS LADY CHILTERN BEFORE SHE WENT MADE A LITTLE SPEECH TO PHINEAS FINN
3923-174992-0039 YOU'LL COME TO US IN THE WINTER MISTER FINN I SHOULD LIKE YOU MUST NO ONE WAS TRUER TO YOU THAN WE WERE YOU KNOW INDEED REGARDING YOU AS WE DO HOW SHOULD WE NOT HAVE BEEN TRUE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ME THAT MY OLD FRIEND SHOULD HAVE BEEN OH LADY CHILTERN
3923-174992-0040 OF COURSE YOU'LL COME YOU OWE IT TO US TO COME AND MAY I SAY THIS IF THERE BE ANYBODY TO COME WITH YOU THAT WILL MAKE IT ONLY SO MUCH THE BETTER IF IT SHOULD BE SO OF COURSE THERE WILL BE LETTERS WRITTEN
