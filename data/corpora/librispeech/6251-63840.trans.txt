6251-63840-0000 CHARLES SUMMERS STRANGERS VISITING MELBOURNE THE CHIEF CITY OF AUSTRALIA WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO OVERLOOK FOUR GREAT MARBLE STATUES WHICH ADORN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY THEY ARE THE GIFT OF
6251-63840-0001 MISTER W J CLARK ONE OF THE DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC MEN OF THAT GROWING EMPIRE THESE STATUES REPRESENT IN A SITTING POSTURE QUEEN VICTORIA PRINCE ALBERT THE PRINCE OF WALES AND THE PRINCESS OF WALES
6251-63840-0002 THEY ARE LARGER THAN LIFE AND ACCORDING TO THE AUSTRALIAN PRESS THEY ARE ADMIRABLE WORKS IN EVERY RESPECT THEY WERE EXECUTED BY CHARLES SUMMERS A SCULPTOR LONG RESIDENT IN THAT COLONY
6251-63840-0003 WHERE HE PRACTICED HIS ART WITH GREAT SUCCESS AS THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND PRIVATE HOUSES OF MELBOURNE ATTEST MANY OF HIS WORKS REMAIN IN THE COLONY AND HE MAY BE SAID TO BE THE FOUNDER OF HIS FORM OF ART
6251-63840-0004 IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD THE HISTORY OF THIS MAN'S LIFE IS SO REMARKABLE THAT I THINK IT WILL INTEREST THE READER SIXTY YEARS AGO CHARLES SUMMERS WAS A LITTLE HUNGRY RAGGED BOY IN ENGLISH
6251-63840-0005 WHO EARNED FOUR CENTS A DAY BY SCARING THE CROWS FROM THE WHEAT FIELDS I HAVE SEEN MYSELF SUCH LITTLE FELLOWS ENGAGED IN THIS WORK COMING ON DUTY BEFORE FOUR IN THE MORNING AND REMAINING TILL EIGHT IN THE EVENING
6251-63840-0006 FRIGHTENING AWAY THE BIRDS BY BEATING A TIN PAN WITH A STICK NOT UNFREQUENTLY CHASING THEM AND THROWING STONES AT THEM HE WAS THE SON OF A MASON WHO HAD EIGHT CHILDREN AND SQUANDERED HALF HIS TIME AND MONEY IN THE TAP ROOM
6251-63840-0007 HENCE THIS BOY FROM THE AGE OF EIGHT OR NINE YEARS SMART INTELLIGENT AND AMBITIOUS WAS CONSTANTLY AT WORK AT SOME SUCH EMPLOYMENT AND OFTEN DURING HIS FATHER'S DRUNKEN FITS HE WAS THE CHIEF SUPPORT OF THE FAMILY
6251-63840-0008 AND HE WAS OFTEN SEEN ON THE HIGH ROAD IN CHARGE OF THE DRUNKARD STRUGGLING TO GET HIM HOME BEFORE HE HAD SPENT THEIR UNITED EARNINGS IN DRINK IN THESE DEPLORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES HE ACQUIRED A DEXTERITY AND PATIENCE
6251-63840-0009 HE WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE A STRONG PROPENSITY TO DO FANCY STONE WORK HE OBTAINED AS A BOY SOME LOCAL CELEBRITY FOR HIS CARVED GATE POSTS AND OTHER ORNAMENTAL OBJECTS IN STONE
6251-63840-0010 SO GREAT WAS HIS SKILL AND INDUSTRY THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE BESIDES HAVING MAINTAINED A LARGE FAMILY FOR YEARS HE HAD SAVED A SUM EQUAL TO A HUNDRED DOLLARS
6251-63840-0011 THEN A PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAPPENED TO HIM A MAN CAME FROM LONDON TO SET UP IN A PARISH CHURCH NEAR BY A MONUMENTAL FIGURE AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR A SKILLFUL MASON TO ASSIST HIM
6251-63840-0012 AND UPON HIM THE CHOICE FELL THUS HE WAS INTRODUCED TO THE WORLD OF ART FOR THIS FIGURE HAD BEEN EXECUTED BY HENRY WEEKES A DISTINGUISHED LONDON SCULPTOR THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS CHILDHOOD
6251-63840-0013 HAD MADE A MAN OF HIM AT THIS EARLY AGE A THOUGHTFUL AND PRUDENT MAN TAKING WITH HIM TEN OF HIS TWENTY POUNDS HE WENT TO LONDON AND APPLIED FOR EMPLOYMENT IN THE STUDIO OF HENRY WEEKES
6251-63840-0014 THIS ARTIST EMPLOYED SEVERAL MEN BUT HE HAD NO VACANT PLACE EXCEPT THE HUMBLE ONE OF STONE POLISHER WHICH REQUIRED LITTLE SKILL HE ACCEPTED THE PLACE WITH ALACRITY AND DELIGHT AT A SALARY OF FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK
6251-63840-0015 HE WAS NOW IN HIS ELEMENT THE LOWLIEST EMPLOYMENTS OF THE STUDIO WERE PLEASING TO HIM HE LOVED TO POLISH THE MARBLE THE SIGHT OF THE NUMEROUS MODELS WAS A PLEASURE TO HIM EVEN WETTING THE CLOTHS AND CLEANING
6251-63840-0016 THE MODEL TOOLS WERE PLEASANT TASKS HIS CHEERFULNESS AND INDUSTRY SOON MADE HIM A FAVORITE AND WHEN HIS WORK WAS DONE HE EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE IN GAINING SKILL IN CARVING AND CUTTING MARBLE
6251-63840-0017 TO EXECUTE TWO COLOSSAL FIGURES IN BRONZE AND THE YOUNG MAN WAS OBLIGED TO SPEND MUCH OF HIS TIME IN ERECTING THE FOUNDRY AND OTHER DUTIES WHICH HE FELT TO BE FOREIGN TO HIS ART
6251-63840-0018 IMPATIENT AT THIS HE RESIGNED HIS PLACE AND VISITED HIS HOME WHERE HE EXECUTED MEDALLION PORTRAITS FIRST OF HIS OWN RELATIONS AND AFTERWARDS OF PUBLIC MEN SUCH AS THE MAYOR OF BRISTOL
6251-63840-0019 AND THE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR HIS COUNTY THESE MEDALLIONS GAVE HIM SOME REPUTATION AND IT WAS A FAVORITE BRANCH WITH HIM AS LONG AS HE LIVED
6251-63840-0020 THE CHIEF OF WHICH IS A GOLD MEDAL GIVEN EVERY TWO YEARS FOR THE BEST GROUP IN CLAY OF AN HISTORICAL CHARACTER A SILVER MEDAL IS ALSO GIVEN EVERY YEAR FOR THE BEST
6251-63840-0021 MODEL FROM LIFE AT THE EXHIBITION OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE WHEN HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE HE WAS A COMPETITOR FOR BOTH THESE PRIZES FOR THE GOLD MEDAL HE EXECUTED A GROUP WHICH HE CALLED MERCY INTERCEDING FOR THE VANQUISHED
6251-63840-0022 FOR THE SILVER MEDAL HE OFFERED A BUST OF A LIVING PERSON HE HAD THE SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE OF WINNING BOTH AND HE RECEIVED THEM IN PUBLIC FROM THE HANDS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMY SIR CHARLES EASTLAKE
6251-63840-0023 CHEER UPON CHEER GREETED THE MODEST STUDENT WHEN HE ROSE AND WENT FORWARD FOR THE PURPOSE HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF GREAT SELF CONTROL INSTEAD OF JOINING IN THE USUAL FESTIVITIES OF HIS FELLOW STUDENTS AFTER THE AWARD
6251-63840-0024 HE WALKED QUIETLY TO HIS LODGINGS WHERE HIS FATHER AND BROTHER WERE ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO HEAR THE RESULT OF THE COMPETITION HE THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR WITHOUT A WORD AND THEY BEGAN TO CONSOLE HIM FOR THE SUPPOSED DISAPPOINTMENT
6251-63840-0025 IN A FEW MINUTES THEY SAT DOWN TO SUPPER WHEREUPON WITH A KNOWING SMILE HE TOOK HIS MEDALS OUT OF HIS POCKET AND LAID ONE OF THEM ON EACH SIDE OF HIS PLATE
6251-63840-0026 FROM THIS TIME HE HAD NO DIFFICULTIES EXCEPT THOSE INHERENT IN THE NATURE OF HIS WORK AND IN HIS OWN CONSTITUTION HIS EARLY STRUGGLE WITH LIFE HAD MADE HIM TOO INTENSE HE HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT PLAY WAS
6251-63840-0027 AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO RECREATE HIMSELF HE HAD LITTLE TASTE FOR READING OR SOCIETY HE LOVED ART ALONE THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE WORKED WITH AN INTENSITY AND CONTINUITY THAT NO HUMAN CONSTITUTION COULD LONG ENDURE
6251-63840-0028 SOON AFTER WINNING HIS TWO MEDALS HIS HEALTH WAS SO COMPLETELY PROSTRATED THAT HE MADE A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA TO VISIT A BROTHER WHO HAD SETTLED THERE THE VOYAGE RESTORED HIM AND HE SOON RESUMED THE PRACTICE OF HIS ART AT MELBOURNE
6251-63840-0029 THE PEOPLE WERE JUST BUILDING THEIR HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND HE WAS EMPLOYED TO EXECUTE THE ARTISTIC WORK OF THE INTERIOR HE LIVED MANY YEARS IN AUSTRALIA AND FILLED THE COLONY WITH HIS WORKS IN MARBLE AND BRONZE
6251-63840-0030 AND YET DURING HIS RESIDENCE IN ROME HE HAD TWENTY MEN IN HIS SERVICE IT WAS IN ROME IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THAT HE RECEIVED FROM MELBOURNE THE COMMISSION TO EXECUTE IN MARBLE THE FOUR COLOSSAL
6251-63840-0031 STATUES MENTIONED ABOVE THESE WORKS HE COMPLETED IN SOMETHING LESS THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS BESIDES DOING SEVERAL OTHER MINOR WORKS PREVIOUSLY ORDERED IT WAS TOO MUCH AND NATURE RESENTED THE AFFRONT
6251-63840-0032 AFTER HE HAD PACKED THE STATUES AND SENT THEM ON THEIR WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE HE SET OUT FOR MELBOURNE HIMSELF INTENDING TO TAKE ENGLAND BY THE WAY FOR MEDICAL ADVICE AT PARIS HE VISITED THE EXHIBITION AND THE NEXT DAY AT HIS HOTEL
6251-63840-0033 FOR THAT HE LIVED AND ALMOST IN THE MIDST OF IT DIED HE COULD NOT HAVE CONCEIVED EXISTENCE WITHOUT IT ALWAYS AND UNDER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE HE WAS THINKING OF HIS WORK AND GATHERING FROM WHATEVER SURROUNDED
6251-63840-0034 HIM SUCH INFORMATION AS HE THOUGHT WOULD PROVE OF SERVICE IN OMNIBUSES IN RAILWAY CARRIAGES AND ELSEWHERE HE FOUND OPPORTUNITIES OF STUDY AND COULD ALWAYS REPRODUCE A LIKENESS
6251-63840-0035 FROM MEMORY OF THE INDIVIDUALS SO OBSERVED I DO NOT COPY THESE WORDS AS COMMENDATION BUT AS WARNING LIKE SO MANY OTHER GIFTED MEN OF THIS AGE HE LIVED TOO FAST AND ATTEMPTED TOO MUCH
6251-63840-0036 HE DIED WHEN HIS GREATEST AND BEST LIFE WOULD NATURALLY HAVE BEEN JUST BEGINNING HE DIED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD WHEN THE CAPACITY FOR HIGH ENJOYMENT OF LIFE IS NATURALLY THE GREATEST
