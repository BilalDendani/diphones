398-130093-0000 THE ARMY AWAKENED AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE WITH EAGERNESS AT THE NOISE OF RUMORS IT CAST ITS EYES UPON THE ROADS WHICH WERE GROWING FROM LONG TROUGHS OF LIQUID MUD TO PROPER THOROUGHFARES
398-130093-0001 PURLED AT THE ARMY'S FEET AND AT NIGHT WHEN THE STREAM HAD BECOME OF A SORROWFUL BLACKNESS ONE COULD SEE ACROSS IT THE RED EYELIKE GLEAM OF HOSTILE CAMP FIRES SET IN THE LOW BROWS OF DISTANT HILLS ONCE
398-130093-0002 A CERTAIN TALL SOLDIER DEVELOPED VIRTUES AND WENT RESOLUTELY TO WASH A SHIRT
398-130093-0003 HE WAS SWELLED WITH A TALE HE HAD HEARD FROM A RELIABLE FRIEND
398-130093-0004 WHO HAD HEARD IT FROM HIS TRUSTWORTHY BROTHER ONE OF THE ORDERLIES AT DIVISION HEADQUARTERS
398-130093-0005 TO HIS ATTENTIVE AUDIENCE HE DREW A LOUD AND ELABORATE PLAN OF A VERY BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THE BLUE CLOTHED MEN SCATTERED INTO SMALL ARGUING GROUPS BETWEEN THE ROWS OF SQUAT BROWN HUTS
398-130093-0006 A NEGRO TEAMSTER WHO HAD BEEN DANCING UPON A CRACKER BOX
398-130093-0007 IT'S A LIE THAT'S ALL IT IS A THUNDERIN LIE SAID ANOTHER PRIVATE LOUDLY HIS SMOOTH FACE WAS FLUSHED
398-130093-0008 HE HAD REFRAINED FROM ADDING EXTENSIVELY TO THE COMFORT OF HIS ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE HE HAD FELT THAT THE ARMY MIGHT START ON THE MARCH AT ANY MOMENT OF LATE HOWEVER HE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED THAT THEY WERE IN A SORT OF ETERNAL CAMP MANY OF THE MEN ENGAGED IN A SPIRITED DEBATE ONE
398-130093-0009 ALL THE PLANS OF THE COMMANDING GENERAL HE WAS OPPOSED BY MEN WHO ADVOCATED THAT THERE WERE OTHER PLANS OF CAMPAIGN
398-130093-0010 NUMBERS MAKING FUTILE BIDS FOR THE POPULAR
398-130093-0011 HE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH SOME NEW THOUGHTS THAT HAD LATELY COME TO HIM HE LAY DOWN ON A WIDE BUNK THAT STRETCHED ACROSS THE END OF THE ROOM IN THE OTHER END CRACKER BOXES WERE MADE TO SERVE AS FURNITURE
398-130093-0012 WAS UPON THE LOG WALLS AND THREE RIFLES WERE PARALLELED ON PEGS EQUIPMENTS HUNG ON HANDY PROJECTIONS AND SOME TIN DISHES LAY UPON A SMALL PILE OF FIREWOOD A FOLDED TENT WAS SERVING AS A ROOF THE SUNLIGHT WITHOUT
398-130093-0013 BEATING UPON IT MADE IT GLOW A LIGHT YELLOW SHADE A SMALL WINDOW SHOT AN OBLIQUE SQUARE OF WHITER LIGHT UPON THE CLUTTERED FLOOR THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE AT TIMES NEGLECTED THE CLAY CHIMNEY AND WREATHED INTO THE ROOM AND THIS FLIMSY CHIMNEY OF CLAY AND STICKS
398-130093-0014 MADE ENDLESS THREATS TO SET ABLAZE THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT
398-130093-0015 SO THEY WERE AT LAST GOING TO FIGHT ON THE MORROW PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE A BATTLE AND HE WOULD BE IN IT FOR A TIME HE WAS OBLIGED TO LABOR TO MAKE HIMSELF BELIEVE
398-130093-0016 THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO MINGLE IN ONE OF THOSE GREAT AFFAIRS OF THE EARTH HE HAD OF COURSE DREAMED OF BATTLES ALL HIS LIFE OF VAGUE AND BLOODY CONFLICTS THAT HAD THRILLED HIM WITH THEIR SWEEP AND FIRE IN VISIONS HE HAD SEEN HIMSELF IN MANY STRUGGLES
398-130093-0017 HE HAD IMAGINED PEOPLES SECURE IN THE SHADOW OF HIS EAGLE EYED PROWESS BUT AWAKE HE HAD REGARDED BATTLES AS CRIMSON BLOTCHES ON THE PAGES OF THE PAST HE HAD PUT THEM AS THINGS OF THE BYGONE WITH HIS THOUGHT IMAGES
398-130093-0018 OF HEAVY CROWNS AND HIGH CASTLES THERE WAS A PORTION OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY WHICH HE HAD REGARDED AS THE TIME OF WARS BUT IT HE THOUGHT HAD BEEN LONG GONE OVER THE HORIZON
398-130093-0019 FROM HIS HOME HIS YOUTHFUL EYES HAD LOOKED UPON THE WAR IN HIS OWN COUNTRY WITH DISTRUST IT MUST BE SOME SORT OF A PLAY AFFAIR HE HAD LONG DESPAIRED OF WITNESSING A GREEKLIKE STRUGGLE
398-130093-0020 SUCH WOULD BE NO MORE HE HAD SAID MEN WERE BETTER OR MORE TIMID SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION HAD EFFACED THE THROAT GRAPPLING INSTINCT OR ELSE FIRM FINANCE HELD IN CHECK THE PASSIONS
398-130093-0021 HE HAD BURNED SEVERAL TIMES TO ENLIST TALES OF GREAT MOVEMENTS SHOOK THE LAND THEY MIGHT NOT BE DISTINCTLY HOMERIC BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE MUCH GLORY IN THEM HE HAD READ OF MARCHES SIEGES CONFLICTS
398-130093-0022 AND HE HAD LONGED TO SEE IT ALL HIS BUSY MIND HAD DRAWN FOR HIM LARGE PICTURES EXTRAVAGANT IN COLOR LURID WITH BREATHLESS DEEDS BUT HIS MOTHER HAD DISCOURAGED HIM
398-130093-0023 AND WITH NO APPARENT DIFFICULTY GIVE HIM MANY HUNDREDS OF REASONS WHY HE WAS OF VASTLY MORE IMPORTANCE ON THE FARM THAN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
398-130093-0024 THAT TOLD HIM THAT HER STATEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT CAME FROM A DEEP CONVICTION MOREOVER ON HER SIDE WAS HIS BELIEF THAT HER ETHICAL MOTIVE IN THE ARGUMENT WAS IMPREGNABLE AT LAST HOWEVER
398-130093-0025 HE HAD MADE FIRM REBELLION AGAINST THIS YELLOW LIGHT THROWN UPON THE COLOR OF HIS AMBITIONS THE NEWSPAPERS THE GOSSIP OF THE VILLAGE HIS OWN PICTURINGS HAD AROUSED HIM TO AN UNCHECKABLE DEGREE THEY WERE IN TRUTH FIGHTING FINELY DOWN THERE
398-130093-0026 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN BED
398-130093-0027 JERKED THE ROPE FRANTICALLY TO TELL THE TWISTED NEWS OF A GREAT BATTLE THIS VOICE OF THE PEOPLE REJOICING IN THE NIGHT HAD MADE HIM SHIVER IN A PROLONGED ECSTASY OF EXCITEMENT LATER HE HAD GONE DOWN TO HIS MOTHER'S ROOM AND HAD SPOKEN THUS MA
398-130093-0028 I'M GOING TO ENLIST HENRY DON'T YOU BE A FOOL HIS MOTHER HAD REPLIED SHE HAD THEN COVERED HER FACE WITH THE QUILT THERE WAS AN END TO THE MATTER FOR THAT NIGHT
398-130093-0029 NEVERTHELESS THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD GONE TO A TOWN THAT WAS NEAR HIS MOTHER'S FARM AND HAD ENLISTED IN A COMPANY THAT WAS FORMING THERE WHEN HE HAD RETURNED HOME HIS MOTHER WAS MILKING THE BRINDLE COW FOUR OTHERS STOOD WAITING
398-130093-0030 MA I'VE ENLISTED HE HAD SAID TO HER DIFFIDENTLY THERE WAS A SHORT SILENCE THE LORD'S WILL BE DONE HENRY SHE HAD FINALLY REPLIED AND HAD THEN CONTINUED TO MILK THE BRINDLE COW
398-130093-0031 AND WITH THE LIGHT OF EXCITEMENT AND EXPECTANCY IN HIS EYES ALMOST DEFEATING THE GLOW OF REGRET FOR THE HOME BONDS HE HAD SEEN TWO TEARS LEAVING THEIR TRAILS ON HIS MOTHER'S SCARRED CHEEKS STILL
398-130093-0032 HE HAD PRIVATELY PRIMED HIMSELF FOR A BEAUTIFUL SCENE
398-130093-0033 WHICH HE THOUGHT COULD BE USED WITH TOUCHING EFFECT BUT HER WORDS DESTROYED HIS PLANS SHE HAD DOGGEDLY PEELED POTATOES AND ADDRESSED HIM AS FOLLOWS YOU WATCH OUT HENRY

398-130093-0043 HE HAD OF COURSE BEEN IMPATIENT UNDER THE ORDEAL OF THIS SPEECH IT HAD NOT BEEN QUITE WHAT HE EXPECTED AND HE HAD BORNE IT WITH AN AIR OF IRRITATION
398-130093-0044 HER BROWN FACE UPRAISED WAS STAINED WITH TEARS AND HER SPARE FORM WAS QUIVERING HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND WENT ON FEELING SUDDENLY ASHAMED OF HIS PURPOSES FROM HIS HOME HE HAD GONE TO THE SEMINARY
398-130093-0045 TO BID ADIEU TO MANY SCHOOLMATES THEY HAD THRONGED ABOUT HIM WITH WONDER AND ADMIRATION HE HAD FELT THE GULF NOW BETWEEN THEM AND HAD SWELLED WITH CALM PRIDE HE AND SOME OF HIS FELLOWS WHO HAD DONNED BLUE
398-130093-0046 WERE QUITE OVERWHELMED WITH PRIVILEGES FOR ALL OF ONE AFTERNOON AND IT HAD BEEN A VERY DELICIOUS THING THEY HAD STRUTTED A CERTAIN LIGHT HAIRED GIRL HAD MADE VIVACIOUS FUN AT HIS MARTIAL SPIRIT
398-130093-0047 BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER AND DARKER GIRL WHOM HE HAD GAZED AT STEADFASTLY AND HE THOUGHT SHE GREW DEMURE AND SAD AT SIGHT OF HIS BLUE AND BRASS
398-130093-0048 AS SHE CHANGED HER ATTITUDE HE OFTEN THOUGHT OF IT ON THE WAY TO WASHINGTON HIS SPIRIT HAD SOARED THE REGIMENT WAS FED AND CARESSED AT STATION AFTER STATION
398-130093-0049 HE HAD FELT GROWING WITHIN HIM THE STRENGTH TO DO MIGHTY DEEDS OF ARMS AFTER COMPLICATED JOURNEYINGS WITH MANY PAUSES
398-130093-0050 WAS A SERIES OF DEATH STRUGGLES WITH SMALL TIME IN BETWEEN FOR SLEEP AND MEALS BUT SINCE HIS REGIMENT HAD COME TO THE FIELD THE ARMY HAD DONE LITTLE
398-130093-0051 GREEKLIKE STRUGGLES WOULD BE NO MORE MEN WERE BETTER OR MORE TIMID SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION HAD EFFACED THE THROAT GRAPPLING INSTINCT OR ELSE FIRM FINANCE HELD IN CHECK THE PASSIONS
398-130093-0052 HE HAD GROWN TO REGARD HIMSELF MERELY AS A PART OF A VAST BLUE DEMONSTRATION HIS PROVINCE WAS TO LOOK OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD FOR HIS PERSONAL COMFORT FOR RECREATION HE COULD TWIDDLE HIS THUMBS AND SPECULATE ON THE THOUGHTS
398-130093-0053 ALSO HE WAS DRILLED AND DRILLED AND REVIEWED AND DRILLED AND DRILLED AND REVIEWED THE ONLY FOES HE HAD SEEN WERE SOME PICKETS ALONG THE RIVER BANK THEY WERE A SUN TANNED PHILOSOPHICAL LOT
398-130093-0054 WHO SOMETIMES SHOT REFLECTIVELY AT THE BLUE PICKETS WHEN REPROACHED FOR THIS AFTERWARD THEY USUALLY EXPRESSED SORROW AND SWORE BY THEIR GODS THAT THE GUNS HAD EXPLODED WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION THE YOUTH ON GUARD DUTY ONE NIGHT CONVERSED ACROSS THE STREAM WITH ONE OF THEM
398-130093-0055 HE WAS A SLIGHTLY RAGGED MAN WHO SPAT SKILLFULLY BETWEEN HIS SHOES AND POSSESSED A GREAT FUND OF BLAND AND INFANTILE ASSURANCE THE YOUTH LIKED HIM PERSONALLY YANK THE OTHER HAD INFORMED HIM
398-130093-0056 YER A RIGHT DUM GOOD FELLER THIS SENTIMENT FLOATING TO HIM UPON THE STILL AIR HAD MADE HIM TEMPORARILY REGRET WAR
398-130093-0057 SOME TALKED OF GRAY BEWHISKERED HORDES WHO WERE ADVANCING WITH RELENTLESS CURSES AND CHEWING TOBACCO WITH UNSPEAKABLE VALOR TREMENDOUS BODIES OF FIERCE SOLDIERY WHO WERE SWEEPING ALONG LIKE THE HUNS OTHERS
398-130093-0058 SPOKE OF TATTERED AND ETERNALLY HUNGRY MEN WHO FIRED DESPONDENT POWDERS THEY'LL CHARGE THROUGH HELL'S FIRE AN BRIMSTONE
398-130093-0059 STILL HE COULD NOT PUT A WHOLE FAITH IN VETERAN'S TALES FOR RECRUITS WERE THEIR PREY
398-130093-0060 THEY PERSISTENTLY YELLED FRESH FISH AT HIM AND WERE IN NO WISE TO BE TRUSTED HOWEVER HE PERCEIVED NOW THAT IT DID NOT GREATLY MATTER WHAT KIND OF SOLDIERS HE WAS GOING TO FIGHT SO LONG AS THEY FOUGHT WHICH FACT NO ONE DISPUTED
398-130093-0061 THERE WAS A MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM HE LAY IN HIS BUNK PONDERING UPON IT HE TRIED TO MATHEMATICALLY PROVE TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT RUN FROM A BATTLE PREVIOUSLY HE HAD NEVER FELT OBLIGED TO WRESTLE TOO SERIOUSLY WITH THIS QUESTION
398-130093-0062 NEVER CHALLENGING HIS BELIEF IN ULTIMATE SUCCESS
398-130093-0063 BUT HERE HE WAS CONFRONTED WITH A THING OF MOMENT
398-130093-0064 THAT PERHAPS IN A BATTLE HE MIGHT RUN HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT AS FAR AS WAR WAS CONCERNED HE KNEW NOTHING OF HIMSELF
398-130093-0065 A LITTLE PANIC FEAR GREW IN HIS MIND AS HIS IMAGINATION WENT FORWARD TO A FIGHT HE SAW HIDEOUS POSSIBILITIES HE CONTEMPLATED THE LURKING MENACES OF THE FUTURE
398-130093-0066 AND FAILED IN AN EFFORT TO SEE HIMSELF STANDING STOUTLY IN THE MIDST OF THEM HE RECALLED HIS VISIONS OF BROKEN BLADED GLORY
398-130093-0067 HE SUSPECTED THEM TO BE IMPOSSIBLE PICTURES
398-130093-0068 HE SAID ALOUD HE FELT THAT IN THIS CRISIS HIS LAWS OF LIFE WERE USELESS
398-130093-0069 HE WAS AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY HE SAW THAT HE WOULD AGAIN BE OBLIGED TO EXPERIMENT AS HE HAD IN EARLY YOUTH HE MUST ACCUMULATE INFORMATION OF HIMSELF AND MEANWHILE HE RESOLVED TO REMAIN CLOSE UPON HIS GUARD LEST THOSE QUALITIES
398-130093-0070 OF WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING SHOULD EVERLASTINGLY DISGRACE HIM GOOD LORD HE REPEATED IN DISMAY
398-130093-0071 THE LOUD PRIVATE FOLLOWED THEY WERE WRANGLING THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID THE TALL SOLDIER AS HE ENTERED HE WAVED HIS HAND EXPRESSIVELY
398-130093-0072 THEN PRETTY SOON YOU'LL FIND OUT I WAS RIGHT HIS COMRADE GRUNTED STUBBORNLY FOR A MOMENT HE SEEMED TO BE SEARCHING FOR A FORMIDABLE REPLY FINALLY HE SAID WELL
398-130093-0073 DIDN'T SAY I KNEW EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD
398-130093-0074 HE BEGAN TO STOW VARIOUS ARTICLES SNUGLY INTO HIS KNAPSACK THE YOUTH PAUSING IN HIS NERVOUS WALK LOOKED DOWN AT THE BUSY FIGURE GOING TO BE A BATTLE SURE IS THERE JIM
398-130093-0075 THUNDER SAID THE YOUTH OH YOU'LL SEE FIGHTING THIS TIME MY BOY WHAT'LL BE REGULAR OUT AND OUT FIGHTING
398-130093-0076 SAID THE LOUD ONE FROM A CORNER WELL REMARKED THE YOUTH LIKE AS NOT THIS STORY'LL TURN OUT
398-130093-0077 SAID THE LOUD ONE THE YOUTH REMAINED SILENT FOR A TIME AT LAST
398-130093-0078 JIM WHAT
398-130093-0079 OH THEY'LL FIGHT ALL RIGHT I GUESS
398-130093-0080 SAID THE OTHER WITH COLD JUDGMENT
398-130093-0081 THINK ANY OF THE BOYS LL RUN PERSISTED THE YOUTH
398-130093-0082 SAID THE OTHER IN A TOLERANT WAY OF
398-130093-0083 BUT YOU CAN'T BET ON NOTHING OF COURSE
398-130093-0084 THE FIRST TIME BUT I THINK THEY'LL FIGHT BETTER THAN SOME IF WORSE THAN OTHERS
398-130093-0085 HE ADDED WITH A MIGHTY EMPHASIS ON THE LAST FOUR WORDS
398-130093-0086 BEGAN THE LOUD SOLDIER WITH SCORN THE OTHER TURNED SAVAGELY UPON HIM THEY HAD A RAPID ALTERCATION IN WHICH THEY FASTENED UPON EACH OTHER VARIOUS STRANGE EPITHETS THE YOUTH AT LAST INTERRUPTED THEM DID YOU EVER THINK YOU MIGHT RUN YOURSELF JIM HE ASKED
398-130093-0087 ON CONCLUDING THE SENTENCE HE LAUGHED AS IF HE HAD MEANT TO AIM A JOKE THE LOUD SOLDIER ALSO GIGGLED THE TALL PRIVATE WAVED HIS HAND
398-130093-0088 I'VE THOUGHT IT MIGHT GET TOO HOT FOR JIM CONKLIN IN SOME OF THEM SCRIMMAGES AND IF A WHOLE LOT OF BOYS STARTED AND RUN
398-130093-0089 THAT ALL OF THE UNTRIED MEN POSSESSED GREAT AND CORRECT CONFIDENCE HE NOW
