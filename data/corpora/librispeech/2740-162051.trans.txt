2740-162051-0000 PHILIP'S WAY HOME LAY THROUGH THE TOWN BUT HE MADE A CIRCUIT OF THE COUNTRY
2740-162051-0001 SO HEARTSICK WAS HE SO UTTERLY CHOKED WITH BITTER FEELINGS HE FELT AS IF ALL THE ANGELS AND DEVILS TOGETHER MUST BE MAKING A MOCK AT HIM THE THING HE HAD WORKED FOR THROUGH FIVE HEAVY YEARS THE END HE HAD AIMED AT
2740-162051-0002 THE GOAL HE HAD FOUGHT FOR WAS HIS ALREADY HIS FOR THE STRETCHING OUT OF HIS HAND YET NOW THAT IT WAS HIS HE COULD NOT HAVE IT OH THE MOCKERY OF HIS FATE OH THE IRONY OF HIS LIFE
2740-162051-0003 IT WAS SHRIEKING IT WAS FRANTIC THEN HIS BOLDER SPIRIT SEEMED TO SAY WHAT IS ALL THIS CHILDISH FUMING ABOUT FORTUNE COMES TO YOU WITH BOTH HANDS FULL BE BOLD AND YOU MAY HAVE BOTH THE WISH OF YOUR SOUL
2740-162051-0004 AND THE DESIRE OF YOUR HEART BOTH THE DEEMSTER SHIP AND KATE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT IF HE MARRIED KATE THE GOVERNOR WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HIM AS DEEMSTER
2740-162051-0005 HAD HE NOT ADMITTED THAT HE STOOD IN SOME FEAR OF THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE ISLAND AND WAS IT NOT CONCEIVABLE THAT BESIDES THE UNSELFISH INTEREST WHICH THE GOVERNOR HAD SHOWN IN HIM THERE WAS EVEN A PERSONAL ONE THAT WOULD OPERATE MORE POWERFULLY
2740-162051-0006 THAN FEAR OF THE OLD FASHIONED MANX CONVENTIONS TO PREVENT ANY RECOMMENDATION OF THE HUSBAND OF THE WRONG WOMAN AT ONE MOMENT A VAGUE MEMORY ROSE BEFORE PHILIP AS HE CROSSED THE FIELDS OF THE LUNCH AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE
2740-162051-0007 OF THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE AND DAUGHTER OF THEIR COURTESY AND BOUNDLESS GRACIOUSNESS AT THE NEXT MOMENT HE HAD DRAWN UP SHARPLY WITH PANGS OF SELF CONTEMPT HATING HIMSELF LOATHING HIMSELF SWEARING AT HIMSELF FOR A MEAN SOULED INGRATE
2740-162051-0008 AS HE KICKED UP THE GRASS AND THE TURF BENEATH IT BUT THE IDEA HAD TAKEN ROOT HE COULD NOT HELP IT THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST WENT FOR NOTHING IN HIS RECKONING WHAT A FOOL YOU ARE PHILIP SOMETHING SEEMED TO WHISPER OUT OF THE DARKEST CORNER OF HIS CONSCIENCE
2740-162051-0009 TAKE THE DEEMSTERSHIP FIRST AND MARRY KATE AFTERWARDS BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK OF THAT EITHER SAY IT COULD BE DONE BY ANY ARTS OF CUNNING OR DUPLICITY WHAT THEN
2740-162051-0010 THEN THERE WERE THE HIGH WALLS OF CUSTOM AND PREJUDICE TO SURMOUNT PHILIP REMEMBERED THE GARDEN PARTY AND SAW THAT THEY COULD NEVER BE SURMOUNTED THE DEEMSTER WHO SLAPPED THE CONVENTIONS IN THE FACE WOULD SUFFER FOR IT
2740-162051-0011 HE WOULD BE TABOO TO HALF THE LIFE OF THE ISLAND IN PUBLIC AN OFFICIAL IN PRIVATE A RECLUSE AN ICY PICTURE ROSE BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE OF THE WOMAN WHO WOULD BE HIS WIFE IN HER RELATIONS WITH THE LADIES HE HAD JUST LEFT
2740-162051-0012 SHE MIGHT BE THEIR SUPERIOR IN EDUCATION CERTAINLY IN ALL TRUE MANNERS AND IN NATURAL GRACE AND BEAUTY IN SWEETNESS AND CHARM THEIR MISTRESS BEYOND A DREAM OF COMPARISON BUT THEY WOULD NEVER FORGET THAT SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A COUNTRY INNKEEPER
2740-162051-0013 AND EVERY LITTLE COBBLE IN THE RICKETY PYRAMID EVEN FROM THE DAUGHTER OF THE INNKEEPER IN THE TOWN WOULD LOOK DOWN ON HER AS FROM A THRONE HE COULD SEE THEM LEAVING THEIR CARDS AT HIS DOOR AND DRIVING HURRIEDLY OFF THEY MUST DO THAT MUCH
2740-162051-0014 IT WAS THE BITTER PILL WHICH THE DEEMSTER'S DOINGS MADE THEM SWALLOW THEN HE COULD SEE HIS WIFE SITTING ALONE A MISERABLE WOMAN DESPISED ENVIED ISOLATED SHUT OFF FROM HER OWN CLASS BY HER MARRIAGE WITH THE DEEMSTER
2740-162051-0015 AND FROM HIS CLASS BY THE DEEMSTER'S MARRIAGE WITH HER AGAIN HE COULD SEE HIMSELF TOO POWERFUL TO OFFEND TOO DANGEROUS TO IGNORE GOING OUT ON HIS DUTIES WITHOUT CHEER AND RETURNING TO HIS WIFE WITHOUT COMPANY
2740-162051-0016 FINALLY HE REMEMBERED HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER AND HE COULD NOT HELP BUT PICTURE HIMSELF SITTING AT HOME WITH KATE FIVE YEARS AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE WHEN THE FIRST HAPPINESS OF EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY HAD FADED HAD STALED
2740-162051-0017 HAD TURNED TO THE WRETCHEDNESS OF STARVATION IN ITS STATE OF SIEGE OR PERHAPS GOING OUT FOR WALKS WITH HER JUST THEMSELVES ALWAYS THEMSELVES ONLY THEY TWO TOGETHER THIS EVENING LAST EVENING AND TO MORROW EVENING
2740-162051-0018 THROUGH THE STREETS CROWDED BY VISITORS DOWN THE HARBOUR WHERE THE FISHERMEN CONGREGATE ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND OVER THE HEAD BETWEEN SEA AND SKY PEOPLE BOWING TO THEM RESPECTFULLY RIGIDLY FREEZINGLY PEOPLE NUDGING AND WHISPERING AND LOOKING THEIR WAY
2740-162051-0019 OH GOD WHAT END COULD COME OF SUCH AN ABJECT LIFE BUT THAT BEGINNING BY BEING UNHAPPY THEY SHOULD DESCEND TO BEING BAD AS WELL WHAT A FUSS YOU ARE MAKING OF THINGS SAID THE VOICE AGAIN BUT MORE LOUDLY
2740-162051-0020 THIS HUBBUB ONLY MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT VERY WELL TAKE KATE AND LET THE DEEMSTERSHIP GO TO PERDITION THERE WAS NOT MUCH COMFORT IN THAT COUNSEL FOR IT MADE NO RECKONING WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT IF MARRIAGE WITH KATE WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM BEING DEEMSTER
2740-162051-0021 IT WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM BEING ANYTHING IN THE ISLE OF MAN AS IT HAD HAPPENED WITH HIS FATHER SO IT WOULD HAPPEN WITH HIM THERE WOULD BE NO STANDING GROUND IN THE ISLAND FOR THE MAN WHO HAD DELIBERATELY PUT HIMSELF OUTSIDE THE PALE
2740-162051-0022 DON'T WORRY ME WITH SILLY EFFORTS TO DRAW A LINE SO STRAIGHT IF YOU CAN'T HAVE KATE AND THE DEEMSTERSHIP TOGETHER AND IF YOU CAN'T HAVE KATE WITHOUT THE DEEMSTERSHIP THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT THE DEEMSTERSHIP WITHOUT KATE
2740-162051-0023 YOU MUST TAKE THE OFFICE AND FOREGO THE GIRL IT IS YOUR DUTY YOUR NECESSITY THIS WAS HOW PHILIP PUT IT TO HIMSELF AT LENGTH AND THE DAYLIGHT HAD GONE BY THAT TIME AND HE WAS WALKING IN THE DARK
2740-162051-0024 BUT THE VOICE WHICH HAD BEEN PLEADING ON HIS SIDE NOW PROTESTED ON HERS DON'T PRATE OF DUTY AND NECESSITY YOU MEAN SELF LOVE AND SELF INTEREST MAN BE HONEST BECAUSE THIS WOMAN IS AN OBSTACLE IN YOUR CAREER
2740-162051-0025 YOU WOULD SACRIFICE HER IT IS BOUNDLESS PITILESS SELFISHNESS SUPPOSE YOU ABANDON HER DARE YOU THINK OF HER WITHOUT SHAME SHE LOVES YOU SHE TRUSTS YOU AND SHE HAS GIVEN YOU PROOF OF HER LOVE AND TRUST HOLD YOUR TONGUE
2740-162051-0026 THAT YOU WILL BE SILENT THAT SHE WILL HAVE NO TEMPTATION TO SPEAK SHE LOVES YOU SHE HAS GIVEN YOU ALL GOD BLESS HER AFFECTIONATE PITY SWEPT DOWN THE SELFISH MAN IN HIM AS THE LIGHTS OF THE TOWN APPEARED ON HIS PATH
2740-162051-0027 HE WAS SAYING TO HIMSELF BOLDLY SINCE EITHER WAY THERE IS TROUBLE I'LL DO AS I SAID LAST NIGHT I'LL LEAVE HEAVEN TO DECIDE WHETHER I'M TO BE A GREAT MAN OR A LITTLE MAN AND DECIDE FOR MYSELF WHETHER I'M TO BE A TRUE MAN OR A HAPPY MAN
2740-162051-0028 I'LL TAKE MY HEART IN MY HAND AND GO RIGHT FORWARD IN THIS TEMPER HE RETURNED TO HIS CHAMBERS THE ROOMS FRONTED TO ATHOL STREET BUT BACKED ON TO THE CHURCHYARD OF SAINT GEORGE'S THEY WERE QUIET AND NOT OVERLOOKED
2740-162051-0029 HIS LAMP WAS LIT THE SERVANT WAS LAYING THE CLOTH LAY COVERS FOR TWO JEMMY SAID PHILIP THEN HE BEGAN TO HUM SOMETHING PRESENTLY IN FEELING FOR HIS KEYS HIS FINGERS TOUCHED AN UNFAMILIAR SUBSTANCE IN HIS POCKET
2740-162051-0030 HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT WAS IT WAS THE CRACKED MEDALLION OF HIS FATHER HE COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT IT UNLOCKING A CHEST HE BURIED IT AT THE BOTTOM UNDER A PILE OF WINTER CLOTHING THIS RECALLED A POSSESSION YET MORE PAINFUL
2740-162051-0031 AND GOING TO A DESK HE DREW OUT THE PACKET OF HIS FATHER'S LETTERS AND PROCEEDED TO HIDE THEM AWAY WITH THE MEDALLION AS HE DID SO HIS HAND TREMBLED HIS LIMBS SHOOK HE FELT GIDDY AND HE THOUGHT THE VOICE THAT HAD TORMENTED HIM WITH CONFLICTING TAUNTS WAS RINGING IN HIS EARS AGAIN
2740-162051-0032 BURY HIM DEEP BURY YOUR FATHER OUT OF ALL SIGHT AND ALL REMEMBRANCE BURY HIS LOVE OF YOU HIS HOPES OF YOU HIS EXPECTATIONS AND DREAMS OF YOU BURY AND FORGET HIM FOR EVER PHILIP HESITATED A MOMENT
2740-162051-0033 AND THEN BANGED DOWN THE LID OF THE CHEST AND RELOCKED IT AS HIS SERVANT RETURNED TO THE ROOM THE MAN WAS A SOLEMN DIGNIFIED AND RETICENT PERSON WHO HAD BEEN GROOM TO THE LATE BISHOP HIS GRAVITY HE HAD ACQUIRED FROM HIS HORSES
2740-162051-0034 HIS DIGNITY FROM HIS MASTER BUT HIS RETICENCE HE HAD CREATED FOR HIMSELF BEING A THING BEYOND NATURE IN CREATURE OR MAN HIS PROPER NAME WAS COTTIER HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN AS JEMY LORD
2740-162051-0035 COMPANY NOT ARRIVED SIR HE SAID WAIT OR SERVE WHAT IS THE TIME SAID PHILIP STRUCK EIGHT BUT CLOCK TWO MINUTES SOON
2740-162051-0036 WHEN THE DISHES HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN AND THE MAN DISMISSED PHILIP TAKING HIS PLACE AT THE TABLE DREW FROM HIS BUTTON HOLE A FLOWER WHICH HE HAD PICKED OUT OF HIS WATER BOWL AT LUNCH
2740-162051-0037 AND FIRST PUTTING IT TO HIS LIPS HE TOSSED IT ON TO THE EMPTY PLACE BEFORE THE CHAIR WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN UP OPPOSITE THEN HE SAT DOWN TO EAT HE ATE LITTLE AND DO WHAT HE WOULD HE COULD NOT KEEP HIS MIND FROM WANDERING
2740-162051-0038 HE THOUGHT OF HIS AUNT AND HOW HURT SHE HAD BEEN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT OF HIS UNCLE AND HOW HE HAD SNUBBED AND THEN SLAVERED OVER HIM OF THE GOVERNOR AND HOW STRANGE THE INTEREST HE HAD SHOWN IN HIM
2740-162051-0039 AND FINALLY HE THOUGHT OF PETE AND HOW LATELY HE WAS DEAD AND HOW SOON FORGOTTEN IN THE MIDST OF THESE MEMORIES ALL SAD AND SOME BITTER SUDDENLY HE REMEMBERED AGAIN THAT HE WAS SUPPING WITH KATE THEN HE STRUGGLED TO BE BRIGHT AND EVEN A LITTLE GAY
2740-162051-0040 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD BE TAKING HER SUPPER AT SULBY AT THAT MOMENT THINKING OF HIM AND MAKING BELIEVE THAT HE WAS WITH HER SO HE TRIED TO THINK THAT SHE WAS WITH HIM SITTING IN THE CHAIR OPPOSITE LOOKING ACROSS THE TABLE BETWEEN THE WHITE CLOTH AND THE BLUE LAMP SHADE
2740-162051-0041 OUT OF HER BEAMING EYES WITH HER RINGS OF DARK HAIR DANCING ON HER FOREHEAD AND HER RIPE MOUTH TWITCHING MERRILY THEN THE AIR OF THE ROOM SEEMED TO BE FILLED WITH A SWEET PRESENCE HE COULD HAVE FANCIED THERE WAS A PERFUME OF LACE AND DAINTY THINGS
2740-162051-0042 SWEETHEART HE LAUGHED HE HARDLY KNEW IF IT WAS HIMSELF THAT HAD SPOKEN IT WAS DEAR DELICIOUS FOOLING BUT HIS EYES FELL ON THE CHEST WHEREIN HE HAD BURIED THE LETTERS AND THE MEDALLION AND HIS MIND WANDERED AGAIN
2740-162051-0043 HE THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER OF HIS GRANDFATHER OF HIS LOST INHERITANCE AND HOW NEARLY HE HAD RECLAIMED THE BETTER PART OF IT AND THEN ONCE MORE OF PETE CRYING ALOUD AT LAST IN THE COIL OF HIS TROUBLE OH IF PETE HAD ONLY LIVED
2740-162051-0044 HIS VOICE STARTLED AND HIS WORDS HORRIFIED HIM TO WIPE OUT BOTH IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS HE FILLED HIS GLASS TO THE BRIM AND LIFTED IT UP RISING AT THE SAME TIME LOOKING ACROSS THE TABLE
2740-162051-0045 AND SAYING IN A SOFT WHISPER YOUR HEALTH DARLING YOUR HEALTH THE BELL RANG FROM THE STREET DOOR AND HE STOOD LISTENING WITH THE WINE GLASS IN HIS HAND WHEN HE KNEW ANYTHING MORE
2740-162051-0046 A VOICE AT HIS ELBOW WAS SAYING OUT OF A PALPITATING GLOOM THE GENTLEMAN CAN'T COME SEEMINGLY HE HAS SENT A TELEGRAM IT WAS JEM Y LORD HOLDING A TELEGRAM IN HIS HAND
