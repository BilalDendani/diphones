4422-283730-0000 IT WAS HARDLY MORE THAN A BUBBLY TRICKLE BUT LOWER DOWN IT GREW WIDER AND WIDER AND RAN BETWEEN THE REEDS AT THE EDGES OF THE MEADOWS
4422-283730-0001 IT RAN FOR ALMOST A QUARTER OF A MILE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF A SORT OF WOOD IT WAS UNDER THE ROOTS OF SOME OF THESE TREES
4422-283730-0002 THAT THE BIGGEST OF THE TROUT HAD THEIR NESTS WHERE FISHERMEN WITH FLIES COULDN'T REACH THEM BUT THERE WERE SOME BIG TROUT TOO THAT LIVED UNDER THE MEADOW BANKS AND USED TO PUT UP THEIR NOSES IN THE SUMMER EVENINGS
4422-283730-0003 AND SUCK DOWN THE FLIES THAT FELL ON THE WATER WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OF DANCING IN THE AIR CUTHBERT AND MARIAN AND DORIS AND GWENDOLEN WERE ALL VERY FOND OF THIS RIVER
4422-283730-0004 THEY USED TO LIE ON THE BANK AND KEEP VERY STILL AND WATCH THE TROUT HAVING THEIR EVENING MEAL THEY
4422-283730-0005 OR A BLUE FLY OR A FLY WITH PALE WINGS LIKE A DISTANT RAIN CLOUD FLOATING DOWN ON THE TOP OF THE WATER AND PROBABLY WONDERING WHERE IT HAD GOT TO AND THEN THEY WOULD HEAR A LITTLE NOISE LIKE GROWN UP PEOPLE MAKE WITH THE TIPS OF THEIR TONGUES AGAINST THE ROOFS OF THEIR MOUTHS
4422-283730-0006 AND GROWING BIGGER AND BIGGER THAT MEANT THAT A TROUT HAD BEEN LYING IN WAIT WITH HIS EYE COCKED ON THE SURFACE OF THE STREAM AND HAD SEEN THE FLY AND LIKED THE LOOK OF HIM AND SUDDENLY DECIDED TO SWALLOW HIM UP
4422-283730-0007 SOMETIMES A FISHERMAN WOULD COME QUIETLY ALONG AND KNEEL DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND AFTER HE HAD SEEN A TROUT RISE WOULD OPEN A LITTLE BOX AND TAKE OUT A FLY LIKE THE ONE THAT THE TROUT HAD EATEN BUT THIS WOULD BE A SHAM FLY
4422-283730-0008 MADE OF FEATHERS AND SILK CUNNINGLY TIED ROUND A SHARP HOOK AND HE WOULD THREAD IT ON TO A PIECE OF GUT SO THIN THAT THEY COULD HARDLY SEE IT THEN HE WOULD TIE THE GUT TO A SORT OF STRING THAT WAS HANGING DOWN FROM THE POINT OF HIS FISHING ROD
4422-283730-0009 AND THEN HE WOULD SWISH HIS ROD UNTIL THE FLY FLEW OUT STRAIGHT AND FELL UPON THE STREAM JUST AS THE REAL ONE HAD DONE SOMETIMES THEY COULD SEE A TROUT COME UP AND LOOK AT THIS FLY AND SHAKE HIS HEAD AND GO DOWN AGAIN
4422-283730-0010 THEN THE TROUT HAD FOUND HIMSELF CAUGHT AND THEY HAD SEEN THE FISHERMAN'S ROD BENT ALMOST DOUBLE AS THE TROUT DASHED TO AND FRO AND AT LAST THEY HAD SEEN THE FISHERMAN SLIP A NET INTO THE WATER
4422-283730-0011 BUT VERY OFTEN THERE WOULD BE NO FISHERMEN AT ALL AND THEY WOULD SEE NOBODY FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HEAR NOTHING BUT THE CRIES OF THE RIVER BIRDS AND THE SUCK SUCK OF THE FEEDING TROUT
4422-283730-0012 THE MAN THAT THEY SAW MOST OFTEN WAS A MAN CALLED BEARDY NED BECAUSE THOUGH HE WAS ONLY A YOUNGISH MAN HE HAD A SANDY COLOURED BEARD AND THEY WERE ALWAYS VERY SORRY FOR HIM
4422-283730-0013 SHE HAD LEFT HIM WITH A LITTLE GIRL ONLY TEN MONTHS OLD AND THAT WAS WHY NED HAD LET HIS BEARD GROW HE HADN'T TIME HE SAID TO LOOK AFTER THE LITTLE GIRL AND SHAVE HIS FACE EVERY DAY AS WELL
4422-283730-0014 AND HE HAD WANDERED ABOUT EVER SINCE DOING ALL SORTS OF ODD JOBS SOMETIMES HE HELPED THE FARMERS GET THEIR HAY IN OR THE GAMEKEEPERS TRAP STOATS AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD CHOP WOOD
4422-283730-0015 AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD GO FAR AWAY AND NOT COME BACK FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS
4422-283730-0016 BECAUSE THAT WAS WHERE HE HAD FIRST MET HIS DEAD WIFE HE HAD LIVED SO MUCH IN THE OPEN AIR THAT HIS SKIN WAS AS DARK AS A RED INDIAN'S AND WHEN HE LAUGHED HIS TEETH WERE LIKE SNOW AND HIS EYES LIKE THE SEA ON A SUNNY DAY
4422-283730-0017 PEOPLE LIKE CLERGYMEN AND LARGE EMPLOYERS OFTEN USED TO TELL HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO SETTLE DOWN BUT WHY SHOULD HE SETTLE DOWN HE ASKED SO LONG AS THERE WAS ONLY LIZ AND SHE COULD SLEEP IN HIS ARMS AS SNUG AS SNUG
4422-283730-0018 LIZ WAS FOUR YEARS OLD NOW AND AS BROWN AS HER FATHER AND HER HAIR WAS SHORT AND CURLY LIKE A BOY'S
4422-283730-0019 FOR BEARDY NED IN SPITE OF HIS GREAT TROUBLE WAS ALWAYS FULL OF A SECRET HAPPINESS AND HE HAD MADE THIS LITTLE SONG OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD THAT HE USED TO SING EVERY TWO OR THREE HOURS THE WICKEDEST GIRL THERE WAS THE WICKEDEST GIRL THERE IS
4422-283730-0020 IS MY YOUNG DAUGHTER LIZ HE ONLY MEANT IT IN FUN OF COURSE AND WHEN LIZ WAS RUNNING ABOUT HE WOULD SHOUT IT AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE BUT WHEN SHE WAS SLEEPY HE WOULD ONLY CROON IT UNTIL HER EYELIDS BEGAN TO DROP
4422-283730-0021 OF COURSE CUTHBERT COULDN'T ALWAYS BE BOTHERED TO GO UP THE RIVER WITH THE GIRLS
4422-283730-0022 IT WAS STILL ONLY MAY SO THAT THE WATER WAS COLD BUT THE AIR ABOVE IT WAS WARM AND STILL AND HE WAS LYING ON THE BANK WITHOUT ANYTHING ON WHEN HE SUDDENLY HEARD A SPLASH AND A GURGLING CRY
4422-283730-0023 HE SAT BOLT UPRIGHT AND THEN LOOKING ACROSS THE POOL HE SAW A LITTLE FORM STRUGGLING IN THE DEEP WATER AND ROLLING OVER IN IT HEAD DOWNWARD AND THEN BEGINNING TO SLIP OUT OF SIGHT IT WAS LIZ WITH ALL HER CLOTHES ON SHE HAD EVIDENTLY SLIPPED DOWN THE STEEP BANK
4422-283730-0024 SHE WOULD BE SURE TO DROWN BECAUSE BEARDY NED WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT
4422-283730-0025 CUTHBERT COULDN'T MOVE BUT A MOMENT LATER HE WAS IN THE WATER AND SWIMMING ACROSS THE POOL AS FAST AS HE COULD AND FASTER THAN HE HAD EVER SWUM BEFORE HE PRAYED TO GOD THAT HE MIGHT BE IN TIME THE POOL HAD NEVER LOOKED SO WIDE
4422-283730-0026 BUT AT LAST HE HAD SWUM ACROSS IT AND MADE A GRAB AT A PIECE OF LIZ'S FROCK JUST UNDER THE SURFACE HE PULLED THIS HARD AND TRIED TO GO ON SWIMMING WITH HIS OTHER ARM AND BOTH LEGS
4422-283730-0027 AND HE WAS ABLE TO STAND UP AND LIFT HER OUT OF THE POOL SHE WAS QUITE PALE AND THE WATER WAS POURING FROM HER MOUTH AND HER EYES WERE STARING AS IF THEY COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING HE SCRAMBLED UP THE BANK GRAZING HIS KNEES
4422-283730-0028 AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO CHOKE AND TAKE DEEP BREATHS JUST THEN TOO BEARDY NED CAME CRASHING THROUGH THE REEDS WITH GREAT STRIDES FOR CUTHBERT HAD SHOUTED AS LOUD AS HE COULD JUST BEFORE HE PLUNGED INTO THE POOL NED'S FACE HAD TURNED GREY
4422-283730-0029 AND THERE WAS A LOOK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE CUTHBERT FEEL ALMOST FRIGHTENED BUT WHEN HE SAW LIZ SITTING UP AND CRYING HE GAVE A SHOUT AND CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS THEN HE GRIPPED CUTHBERT BY THE WRIST AND CUTHBERT COULD FEEL THAT HE WAS SHAKING ALL OVER AND THEN BEARDY NED BEGAN TO CRY TOO
4422-283730-0030 BUT NEXT MOMENT BOTH HE AND LIZ WERE LAUGHING AND CUTHBERT SWAM BACK AGAIN TO PUT ON HIS CLOTHES AND THEN HE CROSSED THE RIVER UPON A PLANK LOWER DOWN WHERE HE FOUND BEARDY NED AND LIZ WAITING FOR HIM
4422-283730-0031 BEARDY NED TOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDER COME ALONG HE SAID AND HAVE SUPPER WITH US HE WAS CARRYING LIZ AND STICKING OUT OF ONE OF HIS POCKETS CUTHBERT COULD SEE THE TAILS OF A BRACE OF TROUT AND PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO A BEND OF THE STREAM
4422-283730-0032 WHERE THE BANK WAS HIGH AND THERE WAS A LITTLE BEACH FROM THE TOP OF THE BANK A GREAT TREE HAD FALLEN WITH ITS ROOTS STICKING UP IN THE AIR
4422-283730-0033 HE HAD PUT A COUPLE OF BLANKETS THERE AND AN OLD WATERPROOF AND STANDING ON THE BEACH WERE A CUP AND KETTLE
4422-283730-0034 AND WAS SHOWING CUTHBERT HOW TO COOK TROUT IT WAS BEGINNING TO GET DARK NOW AND THE STARS WERE SHINING AND THE FLAMES OF THE FIRE MADE THE RIVER LOOK LIKE INK BUT THEY WERE SO SHELTERED UNDER THE HIGH BANK THAT THEY MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN AT HOME
4422-283730-0035 AND DRANK TEA AND LIZ WHO WAS ALMOST ASLEEP HAD A CUP OF MILK AND THEN THEY ATE BISCUITS AND JAM OUT OF A POT AND BEARDY NED FILLED HIS PIPE HE HAD MADE LIZ TAKE OFF HER WET CLOTHES OF COURSE
4422-283730-0036 AND THESE WERE HANGING FROM STICKS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FIRE AND HE HAD WRAPPED HER IN A BLANKET AND SOON SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP LYING ON HIS KNEES AS HE SAT AND SMOKED HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING A LOT BUT AT LAST HE LOOKED AT CUTHBERT
4422-283730-0037 AND I CAN NEVER PAY YOU BACK BUT I'LL SHOW YOU A SECRET THAT NO ONE ELSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS CUTHBERT LIKED SECRETS SO HE WAS RATHER PLEASED BUT BEARDY NED CHANGED THE SUBJECT
4422-283730-0038 THAT I FIRST SAW MY LIZ I MEAN HER MOTHER PERHAPS IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING IT WAS WHERE I FIRST SAW THIS ONE TOO
4422-283730-0039 SHE WAS JUST NINETEEN SHE'D BEEN PADDLING IN THE STREAM I CALLED OUT TO HER AND SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT ME SHE WAS IN AN OLD FROCK BUT SHE LOOKED QUITE THE LADY HER EYES WAS DARK AND SHE WAS SMILING HE MOVED HIS HEAD A LITTLE
4422-283730-0040 THERE GOES A FOX HE SAID HE SUCKED HIS PIPE FOR A MOMENT IN SILENCE THE SOUND OF THE FIRE WAS LIKE SOMEBODY TALKING TO THEM
4422-283730-0041 THEN BEARDY NED FELT IN HIS POCKET AND PULLED OUT THE END OF A CANDLE IT LOOKED LIKE AN ORDINARY CANDLE
4422-283730-0042 JAMES PARKINS THAT WAS HIS NAME AND THERE'S NOT ANOTHER LIKE IT IN THE WHOLE WORLD AND THERE NEVER WON'T BE AGAIN
4422-283730-0043 WHILE HE LOOKED AT CUTHBERT HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED HE SAID WHERE CANDLES GOES TO WHERE THEY GOES TO WHEN THEY GOES OUT NO I DON'T THINK SO SAID CUTHBERT WHERE DO THEY GO TO
