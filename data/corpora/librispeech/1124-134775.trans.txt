1124-134775-0036 THEY KNOW BUT TOO WELL THE EVIL FATE WHICH FOLLOWS THEM THUS HE PROCEEDED FOR SOME TIME WALKING ON WITHOUT CEASING TRAVERSING AT RANDOM STREETS OF WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING FORGETFUL OF HIS FATIGUE AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WHEN A MAN IS SAD
1124-134775-0037 ALL AT ONCE HE FELT THE PANGS OF HUNGER SHARPLY NIGHT WAS DRAWING NEAR HE GLANCED ABOUT HIM TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD NOT DISCOVER SOME SHELTER THE FINE HOSTELRY WAS CLOSED TO HIM
1124-134775-0038 AND PEEPED THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO THE INTERIOR
1124-134775-0039 AND BY A LARGE FIRE ON THE HEARTH SOME MEN WERE ENGAGED IN DRINKING THERE THE LANDLORD WAS WARMING HIMSELF AN IRON POT SUSPENDED FROM A CRANE BUBBLED OVER THE FLAME
1124-134775-0040 THE ENTRANCE TO THIS PUBLIC HOUSE WHICH IS ALSO A SORT OF AN INN IS BY TWO DOORS ONE OPENS ON THE STREET THE OTHER UPON A SMALL YARD FILLED WITH MANURE THE TRAVELLER DARE NOT ENTER BY THE STREET DOOR
1124-134775-0041 HE SLIPPED INTO THE YARD HALTED AGAIN THEN RAISED THE LATCH TIMIDLY AND OPENED THE DOOR WHO GOES THERE SAID THE MASTER SOME ONE WHO WANTS SUPPER AND BED GOOD WE FURNISH SUPPER AND BED HERE HE ENTERED

1124-134775-0044 ALL THAT COULD BE DISTINGUISHED OF HIS FACE BENEATH HIS CAP WHICH WAS WELL PULLED DOWN ASSUMED A VAGUE APPEARANCE OF COMFORT MINGLED WITH THAT OTHER POIGNANT ASPECT WHICH HABITUAL SUFFERING BESTOWS
1124-134775-0045 IT WAS MOREOVER A FIRM ENERGETIC AND MELANCHOLY PROFILE THIS PHYSIOGNOMY WAS STRANGELY COMPOSED IT BEGAN BY SEEMING HUMBLE AND ENDED BY SEEMING SEVERE
1124-134775-0046 THE EYE SHONE BENEATH ITS LASHES LIKE A FIRE BENEATH BRUSHWOOD ONE OF THE MEN SEATED AT THE TABLE HOWEVER WAS A FISHMONGER WHO BEFORE ENTERING THE PUBLIC HOUSE OF THE RUE DE CHAFFAUT
1124-134775-0047 HAD BEEN TO STABLE HIS HORSE AT LABARRE'S IT CHANCED THAT HE HAD THAT VERY MORNING ENCOUNTERED THIS UNPREPOSSESSING STRANGER ON THE ROAD BETWEEN BRAS D'ASSE AND I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NAME
1124-134775-0048 I THINK IT WAS ESCOUBLON NOW WHEN HE MET HIM THE MAN WHO THEN SEEMED ALREADY EXTREMELY WEARY HAD REQUESTED HIM TO TAKE HIM ON HIS CRUPPER TO WHICH THE FISHMONGER HAD MADE NO REPLY EXCEPT BY REDOUBLING HIS GAIT
1124-134775-0049 THIS FISHMONGER HAD BEEN A MEMBER HALF AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY OF THE GROUP WHICH SURROUNDED JACQUIN LABARRE AND HAD HIMSELF RELATED HIS DISAGREEABLE ENCOUNTER OF THE MORNING TO THE PEOPLE AT THE CROSS OF COLBAS FROM WHERE HE SAT
1124-134775-0050 HE MADE AN IMPERCEPTIBLE SIGN TO THE TAVERN KEEPER THE TAVERN KEEPER WENT TO HIM THEY EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS IN A LOW TONE THE MAN HAD AGAIN BECOME ABSORBED IN HIS REFLECTIONS
1124-134775-0051 THE TAVERN KEEPER RETURNED TO THE FIREPLACE LAID HIS HAND ABRUPTLY ON THE SHOULDER OF THE MAN AND SAID TO HIM YOU ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE THE STRANGER TURNED ROUND AND REPLIED GENTLY AH YOU KNOW YES
1124-134775-0052 AND YOU ARE TO BE TURNED OUT OF THIS ONE WHERE WOULD YOU HAVE ME GO ELSEWHERE THE MAN TOOK HIS STICK AND HIS KNAPSACK AND DEPARTED AS HE WENT OUT SOME CHILDREN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM FROM THE CROSS OF COLBAS

1124-134775-0054 HE RANG THE WICKET OPENED TURNKEY SAID HE REMOVING HIS CAP POLITELY WILL YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO ADMIT ME AND GIVE ME A LODGING FOR THE NIGHT A VOICE REPLIED THE PRISON IS NOT AN INN
1124-134775-0055 THE WICKET CLOSED AGAIN HE ENTERED A LITTLE STREET IN WHICH THERE WERE MANY GARDENS SOME OF THEM ARE ENCLOSED ONLY BY HEDGES WHICH LENDS A CHEERFUL ASPECT TO THE STREET IN THE MIDST OF THESE GARDENS AND HEDGES
1124-134775-0056 HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A SMALL HOUSE OF A SINGLE STORY THE WINDOW OF WHICH WAS LIGHTED UP HE PEERED THROUGH THE PANE AS HE HAD DONE AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE WITHIN WAS A LARGE WHITEWASHED ROOM WITH A BED DRAPED IN PRINTED COTTON STUFF
1124-134775-0057 AND A CRADLE IN ONE CORNER A FEW WOODEN CHAIRS AND A DOUBLE BARRELLED GUN HANGING ON THE WALL A TABLE WAS SPREAD IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM A COPPER LAMP ILLUMINATED THE TABLECLOTH OF COARSE WHITE LINEN THE PEWTER JUG SHINING LIKE SILVER

1124-134775-0060 WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE WITHIN HIM HE ALONE COULD HAVE TOLD IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE THOUGHT THAT THIS JOYOUS HOUSE WOULD BE HOSPITABLE AND THAT IN A PLACE WHERE HE BEHELD SO MUCH HAPPINESS
1124-134775-0061 HE TAPPED ON THE PANE WITH A VERY SMALL AND FEEBLE KNOCK THEY DID NOT HEAR HIM HE TAPPED AGAIN HE HEARD THE WOMAN SAY
1124-134775-0062 NO REPLIED THE HUSBAND HE TAPPED A THIRD TIME THE HUSBAND ROSE TOOK THE LAMP AND WENT TO THE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED HE WAS A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE HALF PEASANT HALF ARTISAN

1124-134775-0069 THE PEASANT'S COUNTENANCE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF DISTRUST HE SURVEYED THE NEWCOMER FROM HEAD TO FEET AND SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED WITH A SORT OF SHUDDER
1124-134775-0070 MEANWHILE AT THE WORDS ARE YOU THE MAN THE WOMAN HAD RISEN HAD CLASPED HER TWO CHILDREN IN HER ARMS AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE PRECIPITATELY BEHIND HER HUSBAND STARING IN TERROR AT THE STRANGER
1124-134775-0071 WITH HER BOSOM UNCOVERED AND WITH FRIGHTENED EYES AS SHE MURMURED IN A LOW TONE
1124-134775-0072 AFTER HAVING SCRUTINIZED THE MAN FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS AS ONE SCRUTINIZES A VIPER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE RETURNED TO THE DOOR AND SAID CLEAR OUT FOR PITY'S SAKE A GLASS OF WATER SAID THE MAN A SHOT FROM MY GUN SAID THE PEASANT
1124-134775-0073 AND THE MAN HEARD HIM SHOOT TWO LARGE BOLTS A MOMENT LATER THE WINDOW SHUTTER WAS CLOSED AND THE SOUND OF A BAR OF IRON WHICH WAS PLACED AGAINST IT WAS AUDIBLE OUTSIDE NIGHT CONTINUED TO FALL
1124-134775-0074 A COLD WIND FROM THE ALPS WAS BLOWING BY THE LIGHT OF THE EXPIRING DAY THE STRANGER PERCEIVED IN ONE OF THE GARDENS WHICH BORDERED THE STREET A SORT OF HUT WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO BE BUILT OF SODS
1124-134775-0075 HE CLIMBED OVER THE WOODEN FENCE RESOLUTELY AND FOUND HIMSELF IN THE GARDEN HE APPROACHED THE HUT ITS DOOR CONSISTED OF A VERY LOW AND NARROW APERTURE AND IT RESEMBLED THOSE BUILDINGS WHICH ROAD LABORERS CONSTRUCT FOR THEMSELVES ALONG THE ROADS
1124-134775-0076 HE THOUGHT WITHOUT DOUBT THAT IT WAS IN FACT THE DWELLING OF A ROAD LABORER HE WAS SUFFERING FROM COLD AND HUNGER BUT THIS WAS AT LEAST A SHELTER FROM THE COLD THIS SORT OF DWELLING IS NOT USUALLY OCCUPIED AT NIGHT
1124-134775-0077 HE THREW HIMSELF FLAT ON HIS FACE AND CRAWLED INTO THE HUT IT WAS WARM THERE
1124-134775-0078 HE SET ABOUT UNBUCKLING ONE OF THE STRAPS AT THAT MOMENT A FEROCIOUS GROWL BECAME AUDIBLE HE RAISED HIS EYES THE HEAD OF AN ENORMOUS DOG WAS OUTLINED IN THE DARKNESS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HUT
1124-134775-0079 IT WAS A DOG'S KENNEL HE WAS HIMSELF VIGOROUS AND FORMIDABLE HE ARMED HIMSELF WITH HIS STAFF MADE A SHIELD OF HIS KNAPSACK AND MADE HIS WAY OUT OF THE KENNEL IN THE BEST WAY HE COULD NOT WITHOUT ENLARGING THE RENTS IN HIS RAGS
1124-134775-0080 HE LEFT THE GARDEN IN THE SAME MANNER BUT BACKWARDS BEING OBLIGED IN ORDER TO KEEP THE DOG RESPECTFUL TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THAT MANOEUVRE WITH HIS STICK WHICH MASTERS IN THAT SORT OF FENCING DESIGNATE AS LA ROSE COUVERTE
1124-134775-0081 AND FOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE STREET ALONE WITHOUT REFUGE WITHOUT SHELTER WITHOUT A ROOF OVER HIS HEAD CHASED EVEN FROM THAT BED OF STRAW AND FROM THAT MISERABLE KENNEL HE DROPPED RATHER THAN SEATED HIMSELF ON A STONE
1124-134775-0082 AND IT APPEARS THAT A PASSER BY HEARD HIM EXCLAIM I AM NOT EVEN A DOG HE SOON ROSE AGAIN AND RESUMED HIS MARCH HE WENT OUT OF THE TOWN
1124-134775-0083 HOPING TO FIND SOME TREE OR HAYSTACK IN THE FIELDS WHICH WOULD AFFORD HIM SHELTER HE WALKED THUS FOR SOME TIME WITH HIS HEAD STILL DROOPING WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF FAR FROM EVERY HUMAN HABITATION
1124-134775-0084 WAS NOT ALONE THE OBSCURITY OF NIGHT IT WAS CAUSED BY VERY LOW HANGING CLOUDS WHICH SEEMED TO REST UPON THE HILL ITSELF AND WHICH WERE MOUNTING AND FILLING THE WHOLE SKY MEANWHILE AS THE MOON WAS ABOUT TO RISE
1124-134775-0085 WAS STILL SURROUNDED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN BY ANCIENT WALLS FLANKED BY SQUARE TOWERS WHICH HAVE BEEN DEMOLISHED SINCE HE PASSED THROUGH A BREACH AND ENTERED THE TOWN AGAIN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
1124-134775-0086 AS HE WAS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE STREETS HE RECOMMENCED HIS WALK AT RANDOM IN THIS WAY HE CAME TO THE PREFECTURE THEN TO THE SEMINARY AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE CATHEDRAL SQUARE HE SHOOK HIS FIST AT THE CHURCH
1124-134775-0087 AT THE CORNER OF THIS SQUARE THERE IS A PRINTING ESTABLISHMENT IT IS THERE THAT THE PROCLAMATIONS OF THE EMPEROR AND OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD TO THE ARMY BROUGHT FROM THE ISLAND OF ELBA AND DICTATED BY NAPOLEON HIMSELF WERE PRINTED FOR THE FIRST TIME
1124-134775-0088 WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE AND NO LONGER ENTERTAINING ANY HOPE HE LAY DOWN ON A STONE BENCH WHICH STANDS AT THE DOORWAY OF THIS PRINTING OFFICE AT THAT MOMENT AN OLD WOMAN CAME OUT OF THE CHURCH
