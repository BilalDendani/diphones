644-162690-0005 NEITHER OF THEM CHOOSING TO BE SUBJECT EITHER TO MAGISTRATES OR LAWS WHEN HOWEVER A GOOD WISE AND POWERFUL CITIZEN APPEARS WHICH IS BUT SELDOM
644-162690-0006 WHO ESTABLISHES ORDINANCES CAPABLE OF APPEASING OR RESTRAINING THESE CONTENDING DISPOSITIONS SO AS TO PREVENT THEM FROM DOING MISCHIEF THEN THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE CALLED FREE AND
644-162690-0007 ITS INSTITUTIONS FIRM AND SECURE FOR HAVING GOOD LAWS FOR ITS BASIS AND GOOD REGULATIONS FOR CARRYING THEM INTO EFFECT IT NEEDS NOT LIKE OTHERS
644-162690-0008 BUT THESE ADVANTAGES ARE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN DENIED TO THOSE WHICH FREQUENTLY CHANGE FROM TYRANNY TO LICENSE OR THE REVERSE BECAUSE
644-162690-0009 FROM THE POWERFUL ENEMIES WHICH EACH CONDITION CREATES ITSELF THEY NEITHER HAVE NOR CAN POSSESS ANY STABILITY FOR TYRANNY CANNOT PLEASE THE GOOD AND LICENSE IS OFFENSIVE TO THE WISE
644-162690-0010 IN THE FORMER THE INSOLENT HAVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY AND IN THE LATTER THE FOOLISH
644-162690-0011 WHO MAY BE REMOVED BY DEATH OR BECOME UNSERVICEABLE BY MISFORTUNE HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WHICH COMMENCED IN FLORENCE AT THE DEATH OF GIORGIO SCALI IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
644-162690-0012 AND THEN BY THOSE OF NICCOLO DA UZZANO THE CITY REMAINED TRANQUIL FROM FOURTEEN FOURTEEN TO FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO
644-162690-0013 SO THAT THERE WAS NOTHING EITHER INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL TO OCCASION UNEASINESS NEXT TO NICCOLO DA UZZANO IN AUTHORITY WERE BARTOLOMEO VALORI
644-162690-0014 AND LAPO NICCOLINI THE FACTIONS THAT AROSE FROM THE QUARRELS OF THE ALBIZZI AND THE RICCI AND WHICH WERE AFTERWARD SO UNHAPPILY REVIVED BY SALVESTRO DE MEDICI
644-162690-0015 AND IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE WAS PUT DOWN STILL AS IT COMPREHENDED THE GREATEST NUMERICAL PROPORTION IT WAS NEVER ENTIRELY EXTINCT THOUGH THE FREQUENT BALIAS AND PERSECUTIONS OF ITS LEADERS FROM THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
644-162690-0016 REDUCED IT ALMOST TO NOTHING THE FIRST FAMILIES THAT SUFFERED IN THIS WAY WERE THE ALBERTI THE
644-162690-0017 WHICH WERE FREQUENTLY DEPRIVED BOTH OF MEN AND MONEY AND IF ANY OF THEM REMAINED IN THE CITY THEY WERE DEPRIVED OF THE HONORS OF GOVERNMENT
644-162690-0018 THESE OFT REPEATED ACTS OF OPPRESSION HUMILIATED THE FACTION AND ALMOST ANNIHILATED IT
644-162690-0019 DESTROYED THAT VIGILANCE OVER THOSE WHO MIGHT INJURE THEM WHICH THEY OUGHT TO HAVE EXERCISED THUS DAILY RENEWING THE HATRED OF A MASS OF THE PEOPLE BY THEIR SINISTER PROCEEDINGS
644-162690-0020 AND EITHER NEGLIGENT OF THE THREATENED DANGERS BECAUSE RENDERED FEARLESS BY PROSPERITY OR ENCOURAGING THEM THROUGH MUTUAL ENVY THEY GAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE FAMILY OF THE MEDICI TO RECOVER THEIR INFLUENCE
644-162690-0021 THE FIRST TO DO SO WAS GIOVANNI DI BICCI DE MEDICI WHO HAVING BECOME ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN AND BEING OF A HUMANE AND BENEVOLENT DISPOSITION
644-162690-0022 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE GAVE SO MUCH GRATIFICATION TO THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE THE MULTITUDE THINKING THEY HAD NOW FOUND A DEFENDER THAT NOT WITHOUT OCCASION THE JUDICIOUS OF THE PARTY OBSERVED IT WITH JEALOUSY
644-162690-0023 EXPLAINING TO THEM HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS TO AGGRANDIZE ONE WHO POSSESSED SO MUCH INFLUENCE THAT IT WAS EASY TO REMEDY AN EVIL AT ITS COMMENCEMENT
644-162690-0024 AND THAT GIOVANNI POSSESSED SEVERAL QUALITIES FAR SURPASSING THOSE OF SALVESTRO THE ASSOCIATES OF NICCOLO WERE UNINFLUENCED BY HIS REMARKS FOR THEY WERE JEALOUS OF HIS REPUTATION AND DESIRED TO EXALT SOME PERSON
644-162690-0025 BY MEANS OF WHOM HE MIGHT BE HUMBLED THIS WAS THE STATE OF FLORENCE IN WHICH OPPOSING FEELINGS BEGAN TO BE OBSERVABLE WHEN FILIPPO VISCONTI
644-162690-0026 HAVING BY THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER BECOME MASTER OF ALL LOMBARDY AND THINKING HE MIGHT UNDERTAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
644-162690-0027 WHICH ENJOYED FREEDOM UNDER THE DOGIATE OF TOMMASO DA CAMPO FREGOSO HE DID NOT THINK IT ADVISABLE TO ATTEMPT THIS
644-162690-0028 AND MADE HIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING WITH THEM KNOWN BUT WITH THE AID OF THEIR REPUTATION HE TRUSTED HE SHOULD ATTAIN HIS WISHES HE THEREFORE SENT AMBASSADORS TO FLORENCE TO SIGNIFY HIS DESIRES
644-162690-0029 MANY OTHERS WERE INCLINED TO ACCEDE TO IT
644-162690-0030 THE DUKE TOOK POSSESSION OF BRESCIA AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD OF GENOA CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATION OF THOSE WHO HAD ADVOCATED PEACE FOR THEY THOUGHT BRESCIA WOULD BE DEFENDED BY THE VENETIANS AND GENOA
644-162690-0031 AND AS IN THE TREATY WHICH FILIPPO MADE WITH THE DOGE OF GENOA
644-162690-0032 UPON CONDITION THAT IF HE WISHED TO ALIENATE THEM THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE GENOESE IT
644-162690-0033 AND HE HAD BESIDES ENTERED INTO ANOTHER TREATY WITH THE LEGATE OF BOLOGNA
644-162690-0034 THESE THINGS DISTURBED THE MINDS OF THE CITIZENS AND MADE THEM APPREHENSIVE OF NEW TROUBLES CONSIDER THE MEANS TO BE ADOPTED FOR THEIR DEFENSE
644-162690-0035 THE DISSATISFACTION OF THE FLORENTINES COMING TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF FILIPPO HE EITHER TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF OR TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR PREVAILING FEELINGS
644-162690-0036 SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE CITY TO INTIMATE THAT HE WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT THE SUSPICIONS THEY ENTERTAINED AND OFFERED TO REVOKE WHATEVER HE HAD DONE
644-162690-0037 AND PREPARE TO FRUSTRATE THE ENEMY'S DESIGNS AND IF HE WERE TO REMAIN QUIET IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO GO TO WAR WITH HIM
644-162690-0038 MANY OTHERS WHETHER ENVIOUS OF THOSE IN POWER OR FEARING A RUPTURE WITH THE DUKE CONSIDERED IT UNADVISABLE SO LIGHTLY TO ENTERTAIN SUSPICIONS OF AN ALLY
644-162690-0039 AND THOUGHT HIS PROCEEDINGS NEED NOT HAVE EXCITED SO MUCH DISTRUST THAT APPOINTING THE TEN AND HIRING FORCES WAS IN ITSELF A MANIFEST DECLARATION OF WAR WHICH IF UNDERTAKEN AGAINST SO GREAT A PRINCE
644-162690-0040 AND THE VICINITY OF THE CHURCH OUGHT TO PREVENT ANY ATTEMPT AGAINST ROMAGNA ITSELF HOWEVER
644-162690-0041 PREVAILED THE COUNCIL OF TEN WERE APPOINTED FORCES WERE HIRED AND NEW TAXES LEVIED WHICH AS THEY WERE MORE BURDENSOME UPON THE LOWER THAN THE UPPER RANKS FILLED THE CITY
644-162690-0042 WITH COMPLAINTS AND ALL CONDEMNED
644-162690-0043 DECLARING THAT TO GRATIFY THEMSELVES AND OPPRESS THE PEOPLE THEY WOULD GO TO WAR WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFIABLE MOTIVE THEY HAD NOT YET COME TO AN OPEN RUPTURE WITH THE DUKE
644-162690-0044 BUT EVERYTHING TENDED TO EXCITE SUSPICION
644-162690-0045 WHO WAS IN FEAR OF ANTONIO BENTIVOGLI AN EMIGRANT OF BOLOGNA AT CASTEL BOLOGNESE SENT FORCES TO THAT CITY WHICH BEING CLOSE UPON THE FLORENTINE TERRITORY FILLED THE CITIZENS WITH APPREHENSION
644-162690-0046 BUT WHAT GAVE EVERY ONE GREATER ALARM AND OFFERED SUFFICIENT OCCASION FOR THE DECLARATION OF WAR WAS THE EXPEDITION MADE BY THE DUKE AGAINST FURLI
644-162690-0047 GIORGIO ORDELAFFI WAS LORD OF FURLI
644-162690-0048 UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF FILIPPO THE BOY'S MOTHER SUSPICIOUS OF HIS GUARDIAN SENT HIM TO LODOVICO ALIDOSSI HER FATHER WHO WAS LORD OF IMOLA BUT SHE WAS COMPELLED
644-162690-0049 BY THE PEOPLE OF FURLI TO OBEY THE WILL OF HER DECEASED HUSBAND
644-162690-0050 AND PLACE HIM IN THE HANDS OF THE DUKE UPON THIS FILIPPO
644-162690-0051 TO SEND GUIDO TORELLO AS HIS AGENT WITH FORCES TO SEIZE THE GOVERNMENT OF FURLI AND THUS THE TERRITORY FELL INTO THE DUKE'S HANDS WHEN THIS WAS KNOWN AT FLORENCE
644-162690-0052 THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF WAR WERE GREATLY STRENGTHENED BUT
644-162690-0053 AND AMONG THE REST GIOVANNI DE MEDICI WHO PUBLICLY ENDEAVORED TO SHOW
644-162690-0054 IT WOULD STILL BE BETTER TO WAIT AND LET HIM COMMENCE THE ATTACK THAN TO ASSAIL HIM FOR IN THE FORMER CASE THEY WOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN THE VIEW OF THE PRINCES OF ITALY AS WELL AS IN THEIR OWN
644-162690-0055 BUT IF THEY WERE TO STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW AT THE DUKE PUBLIC OPINION WOULD BE AS FAVORABLE TO HIM AS TO THEMSELVES AND BESIDES THEY COULD NOT SO CONFIDENTLY DEMAND ASSISTANCE AS ASSAILANTS
644-162690-0056 AS THEY MIGHT DO IF ASSAILED AND THAT MEN ALWAYS DEFEND THEMSELVES MORE VIGOROUSLY WHEN THEY ATTACK OTHERS THE ADVOCATES OF WAR CONSIDERED IT IMPROPER TO AWAIT THE ENEMY IN THEIR HOUSES
644-162690-0057 AND BETTER TO GO AND SEEK HIM THAT FORTUNE IS ALWAYS MORE FAVORABLE TO ASSAILANTS THAN TO SUCH AS MERELY ACT ON THE DEFENSIVE AND THAT IT IS LESS INJURIOUS EVEN WHEN ATTENDED WITH GREATER IMMEDIATE EXPENSE
644-162690-0058 TO MAKE WAR AT ANOTHER'S DOOR THAN AT OUR OWN THESE VIEWS PREVAILED AND IT WAS RESOLVED THAT THE TEN SHOULD PROVIDE ALL THE MEANS IN THEIR POWER FOR RESCUING FURLI FROM THE HANDS OF THE DUKE
644-162690-0059 POSTPONED ALL PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND SENT AGNOLO DELLA PERGOLA WITH A STRONG FORCE AGAINST IMOLA
644-162690-0060 MIGHT BE UNABLE TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF HIS GRANDSON AGNOLO APPROACHED IMOLA WHILE THE FORCES OF THE FLORENTINES WERE AT MODIGLIANA
644-162690-0061 AND AN INTENSE FROST HAVING RENDERED THE DITCHES OF THE CITY PASSABLE HE CROSSED THEM DURING THE NIGHT CAPTURED THE PLACE AND SENT LODOVICO A PRISONER TO MILAN
644-162690-0062 THE FLORENTINES FINDING IMOLA IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY AND THE WAR PUBLICLY KNOWN SENT THEIR FORCES TO FURLI AND BESIEGED IT ON ALL SIDES THAT THE DUKE'S PEOPLE MIGHT NOT RELIEVE IT
644-162690-0063 THEY HIRED COUNT ALBERIGO WHO FROM ZAGONARA HIS OWN DOMAIN OVERRAN THE COUNTRY DAILY UP TO THE GATES OF IMOLA AGNOLO DELLA PERGOLA
644-162690-0064 FINDING THE STRONG POSITION WHICH THE FLORENTINES HAD TAKEN PREVENTED HIM FROM RELIEVING FURLI DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT THE CAPTURE OF ZAGONARA THINKING THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT PLACE TO BE LOST
644-162690-0065 WHICH HE OBTAINED ON CONDITION OF GIVING UP ZAGONARA IF THE FLORENTINES DID NOT RELIEVE HIM WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS THIS MISFORTUNE BEING KNOWN IN THE FLORENTINE CAMP AND IN THE CITY
644-162690-0066 AND ALL BEING ANXIOUS THAT THE ENEMY SHOULD NOT OBTAIN THE EXPECTED ADVANTAGE THEY ENABLED HIM TO SECURE A GREATER FOR HAVING ABANDONED THE SIEGE OF FURLI TO GO TO THE RELIEF OF ZAGONARA
644-162690-0067 ON ENCOUNTERING THE ENEMY THEY WERE SOON ROUTED NOT SO MUCH BY THE BRAVERY OF THEIR ADVERSARIES AS BY THE SEVERITY OF THE SEASON FOR HAVING MARCHED MANY HOURS THROUGH DEEP MUD AND HEAVY RAIN
