5641-32124-0000 OR A SYSTEM OF SIGNS REPRESENTING THE SOUNDS OF HUMAN SPEECH WITHOUT IT OUR PRESENT CIVILIZATION COULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE NO SOLUTION OF THE ORIGIN OF OUR EUROPEAN ALPHABET HAS YET BEEN OBTAINED
5641-32124-0001 HEBREWS AND CUSHITES BUT BEYOND THIS THE LIGHT FAILS US
5641-32124-0002 WHOM THE EGYPTIANS CALL THOUTH
5641-32124-0003 THAT BOTH THE PHOENICIANS AND EGYPTIANS REFERRED THE INVENTION TO A PERIOD OLDER THAN THEIR OWN SEPARATE POLITICAL EXISTENCE AND TO AN OLDER NATION FROM WHICH BOTH PEOPLES RECEIVED IT
5641-32124-0004 THE FIRST HERMES HERE REFERRED TO AFTERWARD CALLED MERCURY BY THE ROMANS WAS A SON OF ZEUS AND MAIA A DAUGHTER OF ATLAS THIS IS THE SAME MAIA WHOM THE ABBE BRASSEUR DE BOURBOURG IDENTIFIES
5641-32124-0005 WITH THE MAYA OF CENTRAL AMERICA SIR WILLIAM DRUMMOND IN HIS ORIGINES SAID THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY OF ACCOUNTING EITHER FOR THE EARLY USE OF LETTERS AMONG SO MANY DIFFERENT NATIONS
5641-32124-0006 OR FOR THE RESEMBLANCE WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN SOME OF THE GRAPHIC SYSTEMS EMPLOYED BY THOSE NATIONS THAN BY SUPPOSING HIEROGLYPHICAL WRITING IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE TERM TO HAVE BEEN IN USE AMONG THE TSABAISTS IN THE FIRST AGES AFTER THE FLOOD
5641-32124-0007 WHEN TSABAISIN PLANET WORSHIP WAS THE RELIGION OF ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY THAT WAS YET INHABITED SIR HENRY RAWLINSON SAYS SO GREAT IS THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE OF WRITING AS IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PURSUED IN CHALDEA
5641-32124-0008 AND AS WE CAN ACTUALLY TRACE ITS PROGRESS IN EGYPT
5641-32124-0009 OR EVEN OF ANY ONE AGE LIKE ALL OUR OTHER ACQUISITIONS IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE SLOW GROWTH AND ACCRETION OF AGES IT MUST HAVE RISEN STEP BY STEP FROM PICTURE WRITING THROUGH AN INTERMEDIATE CONDITION LIKE THAT OF THE CHINESE
5641-32124-0010 WHERE EACH WORD OR THING WAS REPRESENTED BY A SEPARATE SIGN THE FACT THAT SO OLD AND ENLIGHTENED A PEOPLE AS THE CHINESE HAVE NEVER REACHED A PHONETIC ALPHABET
5641-32124-0011 AMONG WHOM IT WAS INVENTED AND THE LAPSE OF TIME BEFORE THEY ATTAINED TO IT HUMBOLDT SAYS ACCORDING TO THE VIEWS WHICH SINCE CHAMPOLLION'S GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY ADOPTED REGARDING THE EARLIER CONDITION
5641-32124-0012 ARE TO BE REGARDED AS A PHONETIC ALPHABET THAT HAS ORIGINATED FROM PICTORIAL WRITING AS ONE IN WHICH THE IDEAL SIGNIFICATION OF THE SYMBOLS IS WHOLLY DISREGARDED
5641-32124-0013 THE NATION THAT BECAME MISTRESS OF THE SEAS ESTABLISHED COMMUNICATION WITH EVERY SHORE AND MONOPOLIZED THE COMMERCE OF THE KNOWN WORLD MUST HAVE SUBSTITUTED A PHONETIC ALPHABET FOR THE HIEROGLYPHICS
5641-32124-0014 OF COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE RETAINED THE HIEROGLYPHIC SYSTEM
5641-32124-0015 IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT SOME OF THE LETTERS OF OUR ALPHABET ARE INVENTIONS OF THE LATER NATIONS
5641-32124-0016 OR Y THE TWO FORMS BEING USED AT FIRST INDIFFERENTLY THEY ADDED THE X SIGN
5641-32124-0017 OF THE PHOENICIANS INTO TH OR THETA Z AND S INTO SIGNS FOR DOUBLE CONSONANTS THEY TURNED THE PHOENICIAN Y
5641-32124-0018 THE GREEKS CONVERTED THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET WHICH WAS PARTLY CONSONANTAL INTO ONE PURELY PHONETIC A PERFECT INSTRUMENT FOR THE EXPRESSION OF SPOKEN LANGUAGE THE W WAS ALSO ADDED TO THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET THE ROMANS ADDED THE Y AT FIRST
5641-32124-0019 INDICATED BY THE SAME SOUND A SIGN FOR J WAS AFTERWARD ADDED WE HAVE ALSO IN COMMON WITH OTHER EUROPEAN LANGUAGES ADDED A DOUBLE U THAT IS V V OR W
5641-32124-0020 THE LETTERS THEN WHICH WE OWE TO THE PHOENICIANS ARE A B C D E H I K L M N O
5641-32124-0021 WHICH POSSESSED A PHONETIC ALPHABET IN ANY RESPECT KINDRED TO THIS PHOENICIAN ALPHABET IT CANNOT BE THE CHINESE ALPHABET WHICH HAS MORE SIGNS THAN WORDS IT CANNOT BE THE CUNEIFORM ALPHABET OF ASSYRIA WITH ITS SEVEN HUNDRED ARROW SHAPED CHARACTERS
5641-32124-0022 NONE OF WHICH BEAR THE SLIGHTEST AFFINITY TO THE PHOENICIAN LETTERS IT IS A SURPRISING FACT THAT WE FIND IN CENTRAL AMERICA A PHONETIC ALPHABET THIS IS IN THE ALPHABET OF THE MAYAS THE ANCIENT PEOPLE OF THE PENINSULA OF YUCATAN
5641-32124-0023 WHO CLAIM THAT THEIR CIVILIZATION CAME TO THEM ACROSS THE SEA IN SHIPS FROM THE EAST THAT IS FROM THE DIRECTION OF ATLANTIS THE MAYAS SUCCEEDED TO THE COLHUAS WHOSE ERA TERMINATED ONE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF CHRIST
5641-32124-0024 HAS COME TO US THROUGH BISHOP LANDA ONE OF THE EARLY MISSIONARY BISHOPS
5641-32124-0025 BUT THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL HE FORTUNATELY HOWEVER PRESERVED FOR POSTERITY THE ALPHABET OF THIS PEOPLE WE PRESENT IT HEREWITH LANDA'S ALPHABET
5641-32124-0026 DIEGO DE LANDA WAS THE FIRST BISHOP OF YUCATAN HE WROTE A HISTORY OF THE MAYAS AND THEIR COUNTRY WHICH WAS PRESERVED IN MANUSCRIPT AT MADRID IN THE LIBRARY OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF HISTORY
5641-32124-0027 IT CONTAINS A DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION OF THE PHONETIC ALPHABET OF THE MAYAS LANDA'S MANUSCRIPT SEEMS TO HAVE LAIN NEGLECTED IN THE LIBRARY FOR LITTLE
5641-32124-0028 WHO BY MEANS OF IT HAS DECIPHERED SOME OF THE OLD AMERICAN WRITINGS HE SAYS THE ALPHABET AND SIGNS EXPLAINED BY LANDA HAVE BEEN TO ME A ROSETTA STONE
5641-32124-0029 SINCE AND THE ANCIENT EUROPEAN FORMS IT MUST HOWEVER BE REMEMBERED THAT THE MAYAS ARE ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PEOPLES IN THE WORLD THEY STILL ADHERE WITH STRIKING PERTINACITY TO THE LANGUAGE THEY SPOKE WHEN COLUMBUS LANDED ON SAN SALVADOR
5641-32124-0030 AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS THE SAME AS THE ONE INSCRIBED ON THE MOST ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THEIR COUNTRY SENOR PIMENTAL SAYS OF THEM THE INDIANS HAVE PRESERVED THIS IDIOM WITH SUCH
5641-32124-0031 TENACITY THAT THEY WILL SPEAK NO OTHER IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE WHITES TO ADDRESS THEM IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM
5641-32124-0032 AS DID THE PHOENICIAN THAT IT HAS NOT DEPARTED SO WIDELY FROM THE ORIGINAL FORMS RECEIVED FROM THE COLHUAS THE ALPHABET BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THE VAST EXTENT OF TIME WHICH HAS ELAPSED AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE PROBABLY
5641-32124-0033 WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF THE ALPHABET WHICH PRECEDED THE ARCHAIC PHOENICIAN
5641-32124-0034 EVEN THOUGH WE CONCEDE THAT THEY ARE RELATED IF WE FIND DECIDED AFFINITIES BETWEEN TWO OR THREE LETTERS WE MAY REASONABLY PRESUME THAT SIMILAR COINCIDENCES EXISTED AS TO MANY OTHERS WHICH HAVE DISAPPEARED UNDER THE ATTRITION OF CENTURIES
5641-32124-0035 THE FIRST THOUGHT THAT OCCURS TO US ON EXAMINING THE LANDA ALPHABET IS THE COMPLEX AND ORNATE CHARACTER OF THE LETTERS INSTEAD OF THE TWO OR THREE STROKES WITH WHICH WE INDICATE A SIGN
5641-32124-0036 AND WE FIND THAT THESE ARE THEMSELVES SIMPLIFICATIONS OF OLDER FORMS OF A STILL MORE COMPLEX CHARACTER TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE LETTER
5641-32124-0037 AS IN THE FOLLOWING WHICH WE COPY FROM THE TABLET OF THE CROSS AT PALENQUE WE TAKE
5641-32124-0038 HIEROGLYPHICAL FIGURES SIX CONTAIN HUMAN FACES
5641-32124-0039 WE CAN SEE THEREFORE IN THE LANDA ALPHABET A TENDENCY TO SIMPLIFICATION AND THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD NATURALLY EXPECT WHEN THE EMBLEMS WHICH WERE PROBABLY FIRST INTENDED FOR RELIGIOUS INSCRIPTIONS
5641-32124-0040 PRECISELY THE MAYA LETTER H SIMPLIFIED WE TURN TO THE ARCHAIC HEBREW
5641-32124-0041 SO DID THE PHOENICIANS SLOPE THEIR LETTERS TO THE LEFT HENCE THE MAYA SIGN
5641-32124-0042 IN SOME OF THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABETS WE EVEN FIND THE LETTER H MADE WITH THE DOUBLE STROKES ABOVE AND BELOW AS IN THE MAYA H
5641-32124-0043 IN TIME THE GREEKS CARRIED THE WORK OF SIMPLIFICATION STILL FARTHER AND ELIMINATED THE TOP LINES
5641-32124-0044 AND THEY LEFT THE LETTER AS IT HAS COME DOWN TO US H NOW IT MAY BE SAID THAT ALL THIS IS COINCIDENCE IF IT IS IT IS CERTAINLY REMARKABLE
5641-32124-0045 THE M HERE IS CERTAINLY INDICATED BY THE CENTRAL PART OF THIS COMBINATION THE FIGURE WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM IT IS CLEARLY TAKEN FROM THE HEART OF THE ORIGINAL FIGURE WHEREIN IT APPEARS WHAT DOES THIS PROVE
5641-32124-0046 SOME CHARACTERISTIC MARK WITH WHICH THEY REPRESENTED THE WHOLE FIGURE NOW LET US APPLY THIS RULE WE HAVE SEEN IN THE TABLE OF ALPHABETS THAT IN EVERY LANGUAGE FROM OUR OWN DAY TO THE TIME OF THE PHOENICIANS O HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY A CIRCLE
5641-32124-0047 OR A CIRCLE WITHIN A CIRCLE NOW WHERE DID THE PHOENICIANS GET IT CLEARLY FROM THE MAYAS
5641-32124-0048 TO EXIST IN THE CASE OF THE MAYA M TO THESE
5641-32124-0049 FOUND IN EACH IS THE CIRCLE
5641-32124-0050 AS IN THE CASE OF THE M IS PROVED BY THE VERY SIGN USED AT THE FOOT OF LANDA'S ALPHABET
5641-32124-0051 OR MO IT IS PROBABLY THE LATTER AND IN IT WE HAVE THE CIRCLE DETACHED FROM THE HIEROGLYPH WE FIND THE PRECISE MAYA O A CIRCLE IN A CIRCLE OR A DOT WITHIN A
5641-32124-0052 SIDE OF THE CIRCLE INSTEAD OF BELOW IT AS IN THE MAYA ARE THESE ANOTHER SET OF COINCIDENCES TAKE ANOTHER LETTER
5641-32124-0053 THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE OUR LETTER S BUT QUITE UNLIKE OUR N BUT LET US EXAMINE INTO THE PEDIGREE OF OUR N WE FIND IN THE ARCHAIC ETHIOPIAN A LANGUAGE AS OLD AS THE EGYPTIAN AND WHICH REPRESENTS THE CUSHITE BRANCH OF THE ATLANTEAN STOCK
5641-32124-0054 IN ARCHAIC PHOENICIAN IT COMES STILL CLOSER TO THE S SHAPE THUS
5641-32124-0055 THE OLD HEBREW THE MOAB STONE
5641-32124-0056 THE LATER PHOENICIANS
5641-32124-0057 ALL THESE FORMS SEEM TO BE REPRESENTATIONS OF A SERPENT WE TURN TO THE VALLEY OF THE NILE AND WE FIND THAT THE EGYPTIAN
5641-32124-0058 CAN ANYTHING BE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN TO FIND THE SERPENT
5641-32124-0059 AND IN ALL THESE OLD WORLD LANGUAGES
5641-32124-0060 THIS DOES NOT LOOK MUCH LIKE OUR LETTER K BUT LET US EXAMINE IT FOLLOWING THE PRECEDENT
5641-32124-0061 LET US SEE WHAT IS THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE HERE IT IS CLEARLY THE FIGURE OF A SERPENT STANDING ERECT WITH ITS TAIL DOUBLED AROUND ITS MIDDLE FORMING A CIRCLE
5641-32124-0062 AN ERECT SERPENT WITH AN ENLARGED BODY A SACRED EMBLEM FOUND IN THE HAIR OF THEIR DEITIES
5641-32124-0063 PRECISELY AS IN THE MAYA THUS
5641-32124-0064 THE SERPENT AND THE PROTUBERANCE
5641-32124-0065 NOW WE TURN TO THE ANCIENT ETHIOPIAN SIGN FOR K KA
5641-32124-0066 THAT THE TWO LINES PROJECTING FROM THE UPRIGHT STROKE OF OUR ENGLISH K ARE A REMINISCENCE OF THE CONVOLUTION OF THE SERPENT IN THE MAYA ORIGINAL AND THE EGYPTIAN COPY
5641-32124-0067 WHAT IS THE DISTINCTIVE MARK ABOUT THIS FIGURE IT IS THE CROSS COMPOSED OF TWO CURVED LINES
5641-32124-0068 LIKE A FIGURE EIGHT HERE AGAIN WE TURN TO THE VALLEY OF THE NILE
5641-32124-0069 WE EVEN FIND THE CURVED LINES OF THE MAYA T WHICH GIVE
5641-32124-0070 THUS THE PUNIC T REPEATS THE MAYA FORM ALMOST EXACTLY AS
5641-32124-0071 NOW SUPPOSE A BUSY PEOPLE COMPELLED TO MAKE THIS MARK EVERY DAY FOR A THOUSAND YEARS AND GENERALLY IN A HURRY AND THE CROSS WOULD SOON BE MADE WITHOUT CURVING THE LINES IT WOULD BECOME X
5641-32124-0072 THE FIRST LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE FOOT OF A LION OR TIGER THE THIRD IS PLAINLY A FOOT OR BOOT IF ONE WERE REQUIRED TO GIVE HURRIEDLY A RUDE OUTLINE OF EITHER OF THESE
5641-32124-0073 THE ANCIENT GREEK WAS THE FOOT REVERSED
5641-32124-0074 THE LATER GREEK BECAME OUR A
5641-32124-0075 NOW WHAT IS THE PECULIARITY OF THIS HIEROGLYPH THE CIRCLE BELOW IS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THERE ARE MANY CIRCULAR FIGURES IN THE MAYA ALPHABET CLEARLY IF ONE WAS CALLED UPON TO SIMPLIFY THIS HE WOULD RETAIN THE TWO SMALL CIRCLES JOINED SIDE BY SIDE
5641-32124-0076 AT THE TOP AND WOULD INDICATE THE LOWER CIRCLE WITH A LINE OR DASH AND WHEN WE TURN TO THE EGYPTIAN Q WE FIND IT IN THIS SHAPE
5641-32124-0077 IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE EARLIEST PHOENICIAN ALPHABET DID NOT CONTAIN THE LETTER R
5641-32124-0078 A VERY FAIR REPRESENTATION OF AN R LYING UPON ITS FACE IS IT NOT ANOTHER REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT THE P IN BOTH MAYA AND PHOENICIAN SHOULD CONTAIN THIS SINGULAR SIGN
5641-32124-0079 ON THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY INDICATED TO REDUCE THIS TO ITS ELEMENTS WE WOULD USE A FIGURE LIKE THIS
5641-32124-0080 WITH THE LETTER M THAT IS DRAW FROM THE INSIDE OF THE HIEROGLYPH SOME SYMBOL THAT WILL BRIEFLY INDICATE THE WHOLE LETTER WE WILL HAVE ONE OF TWO FORMS
5641-32124-0081 AND EITHER OF THESE FORMS BRINGS US QUITE CLOSE TO THE LETTER L OF THE OLD WORLD
5641-32124-0082 WHILE IN THE ARCHAIC HEBREW WE HAVE THE SAME CRESCENT FIGURE
5641-32124-0083 WE SEE THIS FORM ON THE MAYA MONUMENTS THE DOTS IN TIME WERE INDICATED BY STROKES
5641-32124-0084 THIS IS EXACTLY THE FORM FOUND ON THE AMERICAN MONUMENTS THE MAYA
5641-32124-0085 THE LEFT HAND LINE WAS DROPPED AND WE COME TO THE FIGURE USED ON THE STONE OF MOAB
5641-32124-0086 THIS IN TIME BECAME THE OLD HEBREW OR
5641-32124-0087 THERE IS HOWEVER A SYMBOL CALLED CA
5641-32124-0088 IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE LETTER K IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SIGN CA
5641-32124-0089 AS IN OUR WORDS CITRON CIRCLE CIVIL CIRCUS ET CETERA AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE MAYA ALPHABET CA AND NOT K IT EVIDENTLY REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT SOUND
5641-32124-0090 A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR SIGN IS FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE SYMBOL FOR K
5641-32124-0091 TO BE A SIMPLIFICATION OF CA BUT TURNED DOWNWARD IF NOW WE TURN TO THE EGYPTIAN LETTERS WE FIND THE SIGN
5641-32124-0092 WHILE THE SIGN FOR K
5641-32124-0093 THE RESEMBLANCE STILL MORE STRIKING TO KINDRED EUROPEAN LETTERS
5641-32124-0094 EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH FOR S IS
5641-32124-0095 AND THE ILLYRIAN S
5641-32124-0096 IN SOME CASES THE PEDIGREE IS SO PLAIN AS TO BE INDISPUTABLE
5641-32124-0097 SURELY ALL THIS CANNOT BE ACCIDENT BUT WE FIND ANOTHER SINGULAR PROOF OF THE TRUTH OF THIS THEORY IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE MAYA ALPHABET LACKS THE LETTER D AND THE LETTER R THE MEXICAN ALPHABET POSSESSED A D THE SOUNDS D
5641-32124-0098 AND T WERE PROBABLY INDICATED IN THE
5641-32124-0099 IN THE OLDEST KNOWN FORM OF THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET THAT FOUND ON THE MOAB STONE WE FIND IN THE SAME WAY BUT ONE SIGN TO EXPRESS THE D AND T D DOES NOT OCCUR ON THE ETRUSCAN MONUMENTS T BEING USED IN ITS PLACE
5641-32124-0100 THEY ADDED TWO NEW SIGNS FOR THE LETTERS D AND R
5641-32124-0101 THE SAME SIGN WITH VERY LITTLE MODIFICATION WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY OBTAINED FROM THE MAYA ALPHABET AS THE SYMBOL FOR B TO ILLUSTRATE THIS WE PLACE THE SIGNS SIDE BY SIDE
5641-32124-0102 YET THEY TELL US THAT TAAUT MADE RECORDS AND DELIVERED THEM TO HIS SUCCESSORS AND TO FOREIGNERS
5641-32124-0103 ISIRIS OSIRIS THE EGYPTIAN GOD
5641-32124-0104 IN THE ALPHABETICAL TABLE WHICH WE HEREWITH APPEND WE HAVE REPRESENTED THE SIGN V OR VAU OR F BY THE MAYA SIGN FOR U
5641-32124-0105 SOME OTHER KINDRED WRITINGS THE VAU TAKES THE PLACE OF F AND INDICATES
5641-32124-0106 F OCCURS IN THE SAME PLACE ALSO ON THE IDALIAN TABLET OF CYPRUS IN LYCIAN ALSO IN TUARIK BERBER AND SOME OTHER WRITINGS AMERICAN CYCLOPAEDIA
