5538-70919-0000 AT SEVEN O'CLOCK PRECISELY ANTHONY DEXTER'S OLD HOUSEKEEPER RANG THE RISING BELL
5538-70919-0001 THE DOCTOR DID NOT AT ONCE RESPOND TO THE SUMMONS IN FACT THE BREAKFAST BELL HAD RUNG BEFORE HE WAS FULLY AWAKE HE DRESSED LEISURELY AND WAS HAUNTED BY A VAGUE FEELING THAT SOMETHING UNPLEASANT HAD HAPPENED
5538-70919-0002 AT LENGTH HE REMEMBERED THAT JUST BEFORE DUSK IN THE GARDEN OF EVELINA GREY'S OLD HOUSE HE HAD SEEN A GHOST A GHOST WHO CONFRONTED HIM MUTELY WITH A THING HE HAD LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN
5538-70919-0003 IT WAS SUBJECTIVE PURELY MUSED ANTHONY DEXTER
5538-70919-0004 HIS REASON WAS FULLY SATISFIED WITH THE PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION BUT HE WAS NOT A MAN WHO WAS LIKELY TO HAVE AN HALLUCINATION OF ANY SORT HE WAS STRONG AND STRAIGHT OF BODY FINELY MUSCULAR AND DID NOT LOOK OVER FORTY
5538-70919-0005 THOUGH IT WAS MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT HE HAD REACHED THE FORTIETH MILESTONE HIS HAIR WAS THINNING A LITTLE AT THE TEMPLES AND THE REST OF IT WAS TOUCHED GENEROUSLY WITH GREY HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND HIS SKIN CLEAR A FULL BEARD CLOSELY CROPPED HID THE WEAKNESS OF HIS CHIN
5538-70919-0006 BUT DID NOT ENTIRELY CONCEAL THOSE FINE LINES ABOUT THE MOUTH WHICH MEAN CRUELTY SOMEWAY IN LOOKING AT HIM ONE GOT THE IMPRESSION OF A MACHINE WELL NIGH PERFECT OF ITS KIND HIS DARK EYES WERE SHARP AND PENETRATING
5538-70919-0007 ONCE THEY HAD BEEN SYMPATHETIC BUT HE HAD OUTGROWN THAT HIS HANDS WERE LARGE WHITE AND WELL KEPT HIS FINGERS KNOTTED AND BLUNT AT THE TIPS HE HAD PRE EMINENTLY THE HAND OF THE SURGEON CAPABLE OF SWIFTNESS AND STRENGTH
5538-70919-0008 AND YET OF DELICACY IT WAS NOT A HAND THAT WOULD TREMBLE EASILY IT WAS POWERFUL AND IN A WAY BRUTAL HE WAS THOROUGHLY SELF SATISFIED AS WELL HE MIGHT BE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRYSIDE ADMITTED HIS SKILL
5538-70919-0009 AND EVEN IN THE OPERATING ROOMS OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE CITY NOT FAR DISTANT DOCTOR DEXTER'S NAME WAS WELL KNOWN HE HAD THOUGHT SERIOUSLY AT TIMES OF SEEKING A WIDER FIELD BUT HE LIKED THE COUNTRY AND THE OPEN AIR AND HIS PRACTICE WOULD GIVE RALPH THE OPPORTUNITY HE NEEDED
5538-70919-0010 DOCTOR DEXTER'S OWN ALMA MATER HE HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME SINCE HE ENTERED THE SCHOOL HAVING UNDERTAKEN TO DO IN THREE YEARS THE WORK WHICH USUALLY REQUIRED FOUR HE WROTE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER AND DOCTOR DEXTER INVARIABLY WENT TO THE POST OFFICE HIMSELF
5538-70919-0011 ON THE DAYS RALPH'S LETTERS WERE EXPECTED HE HAD THE ENTIRE CORRESPONDENCE ON FILE AND WHILED AWAY MANY A LONELY EVENING
5538-70919-0012 ALL READY TO HANG UP ON THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE BESIDE YOURS I'LL BE GLAD TO GET OUT OF THE GRIND FOR A WHILE I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE WORKED AS HIS SATANIC MAJESTY UNDOUBTEDLY DOES WHEN HE RECEIVES WORD THAT A FRESH BATCH OF MORMONS HAS HIT THE TRAIL FOR THE GOOD INTENTIONS PAVEMENT
5538-70919-0013 AT FIRST I SUPPOSE THERE WON'T BE MUCH FOR ME TO DO I'LL HAVE TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE COMMUNITY BY LISTENING TO THE OLD LADIES SYMPTOMS THREE OR FOUR HOURS A DAY REGULARLY FINALLY THEY'LL LET ME VACCINATE THE KIDS AND THE REST WILL BE PITIFULLY EASY
5538-70919-0014 KIDS ALWAYS LIKE ME FOR SOME OCCULT REASON
5538-70919-0015 NEVER MIND THOUGH DAD I'LL BE GENEROUS AND WHACK UP AS YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE WITH ME REMEMBERING THE BOYISHNESS OF IT ANTHONY DEXTER SMILED A LITTLE AND TOOK ANOTHER SATISFYING LOOK AT THE PICTURED FACE BEFORE HIM
5538-70919-0016 RALPH'S EYES WERE AS HIS FATHER'S HAD BEEN FRANK AND FRIENDLY AND CLEAR WITH NO HINT OF SUSPICION HIS CHIN WAS FIRM AND HIS MOUTH DETERMINED BUT THE CORNERS OF IT TURNED UP DECIDEDLY AND THE UPPER LIP WAS SHORT
5538-70919-0017 THE UNPREJUDICED OBSERVER WOULD HAVE SEEN MERELY AN HONEST INTELLIGENT MANLY YOUNG FELLOW WHO LOOKED AS IF HE MIGHT BE GOOD COMPANY ANTHONY DEXTER SAW ALL THIS AND A GREAT DEAL MORE IT WAS HIS PRIDE THAT HE WAS UNEMOTIONAL
5538-70919-0018 BY RIGID SELF DISCIPLINE HE HAD WHOLLY MASTERED HIMSELF HIS DETACHMENT FROM HIS KIND WAS AT FIRST SPASMODIC THEN EXCEPTIONALLY COMPLETE EXCEPTING RALPH HIS RELATION TO THE WORLD WAS THAT OF AN UNIMPASSIONED CRITIC
5538-70919-0019 HE WAS SO SURE OF HIS OWN GROUND THAT HE THOUGHT HE CONSIDERED RALPH IMPERSONALLY ALSO OVER A NATURE WHICH AT THE BEGINNING WAS WARMLY HUMAN DOCTOR DEXTER HAD LAID THIS GLACIAL MASK HE DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO WITH NEATNESS AND DISPATCH
5538-70919-0020 IF AN OPERATION WAS NECESSARY HE SAID SO AT ONCE NOT TROUBLING HIMSELF TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT GRADUALLY IF THERE WAS DOUBT AS TO THE OUTCOME HE WOULD CHEERFULLY ADVISE THE PATIENT TO MAKE A WILL FIRST BUT THERE WAS SELDOM DOUBT
5538-70919-0021 FOR THOSE WHITE BLUNT FINGERS WERE VERY SURE HE BELIEVED IN THE CLEAN CUT SUDDEN STROKE AND CONDUCTED HIS LIFE UPON THAT BASIS WITHOUT SO MUCH AS THE QUIVER OF AN EYELASH ANTHONY DEXTER COULD TELL A MAN THAT WITHIN AN HOUR HIS WIFE WOULD BE DEAD
5538-70919-0022 AND ADMIRED HIS SKILL BUT NO ONE LOVED HIM EXCEPT HIS SON AMONG ALL HIS ACQUAINTANCES THERE WAS NONE WHO CALLED HIM FRIEND EXCEPT AUSTIN THORPE THE OLD MINISTER WHO HAD BUT LATELY COME TO TOWN
5538-70919-0023 THIS IN ITSELF WAS NO DISTINCTION FOR THORPE WAS THE FRIEND OF EVERY MAN WOMAN CHILD AND ANIMAL IN THE VILLAGE NO TWO MEN COULD HAVE BEEN MORE UNLIKE BUT FRIENDSHIP LIKE LOVE IS OFTEN A MATTER OF CHEMICAL AFFINITY WHEREIN OPPOSITES RUSH TOGETHER IN OBEDIENCE TO A HIDDEN LAW
5538-70919-0024 THE BROADLY HUMAN CREED OF THE MINISTER INCLUDED EVERY LIVING THING AND THE MAN HIMSELF INTERESTED DOCTOR DEXTER IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT A NEW SLIDE FOR HIS MICROSCOPE MIGHT INTEREST HIM THEY EXCHANGED VISITS FREQUENTLY WHEN THE DUTIES OF BOTH PERMITTED
5538-70919-0025 AND THE DOCTOR REFLECTED THAT WHEN RALPH CAME THORPE WOULD BE LONELY THE DEXTER HOUSE WAS AN OLD ONE BUT IT HAD BEEN KEPT IN GOOD REPAIR FROM TIME TO TIME
5538-70919-0026 ONE WING AT THE RIGHT OF THE HOUSE CONTAINED THE DOCTOR'S MEDICAL LIBRARY OFFICE RECEPTION ROOM AND LABORATORY DOORS WERE ARRANGED IN METROPOLITAN FASHION SO THAT PATIENTS MIGHT GO OUT OF THE OFFICE WITHOUT MEETING ANY ONE
5538-70919-0027 THE LABORATORY AT THE BACK OF THE WING WAS WELL FITTED WITH MODERN APPLIANCES FOR ORIGINAL RESEARCH AND HAD TOO ITS OWN OUTSIDE DOOR
5538-70919-0028 WHEN RALPH CAME HOME THE OTHER WING AT THE LEFT OF THE HOUSE WAS TO BE ARRANGED IN LIKE MANNER FOR HIM IF HE SO DESIRED DOCTOR DEXTER HAD SOME ROUGH DRAWINGS UNDER CONSIDERATION BUT WANTED RALPH TO ORDER THE PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN IDEAS
5538-70919-0029 THE BREAKFAST BELL RANG AGAIN AND DOCTOR DEXTER WENT DOWNSTAIRS THE SERVANT MET HIM IN THE HALL BREAKFAST IS WAITING SIR SHE SAID ALL RIGHT RETURNED THE DOCTOR ABSENTLY
5538-70919-0030 HE PICKED IT UP WONDERINGLY AND OPENED IT INSIDE WERE THE DISCOLOURED PEARLS ON THEIR BED OF YELLOWED SATIN AND THE IVORY TINTED SLIP OF PAPER ON WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN SO LONG AGO IN HIS CLEAR BOYISH HAND FIRST
5538-70919-0031 FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA AND THEN FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY LOVE BEING UNEMOTIONAL HE EXPERIENCED NOTHING AT FIRST SAVE NATURAL SURPRISE HE STOOD THERE STARING INTO VACANCY IDLY FINGERING THE PEARLS
5538-70919-0032 BY SOME EVIL MAGIC OF THE MOMENT THE HOUR SEEMED SET BACK A FULL QUARTER OF A CENTURY AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY HE SAW EVELINA BEFORE HIM SHE HAD BEEN A GIRL OF EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY AND CHARM
5538-70919-0033 HE HAD TRAVELLED FAR AND SEEN MANY BUT THERE HAD BEEN NONE LIKE EVELINA HOW HE HAD LOVED HER IN THOSE DEAD YESTERDAYS AND HOW SHE HAD LOVED HIM THE POIGNANT SWEETNESS OF IT CAME BACK
5538-70919-0034 HE HAD DISPLACED THE UNPLEASANT ONES WHICH CONSTANTLY STROVE FOR THE RIGHT OF POSSESSION HARD WORK AND NEW LOVE AND DAILY WEARYING OF THE BODY TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION HAD BANISHED THOSE PHANTOMS OF EARLIER YEARS SAVE IN HIS DREAMS
5538-70919-0035 AT NIGHT THE SOUL CLAIMS ITS OWN ITS RIGHT TO SUFFER FOR ITS SECRET SINS ITS SHIRKING ITS BETRAYALS IT IS NOT PLEASANT FOR A MAN TO BE BRANDED IN HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS A COWARD
5538-70919-0036 REFUSAL TO ADMIT IT BY DAY DOES NOT CHANGE THE HOUR OF THE NIGHT WHEN LIFE IS AT ITS LOWEST EBB AND SLEEPLESS MAN FACES HIMSELF AS HE IS THE NECKLACE SLIPPED SNAKILY OVER HIS HAND
5538-70919-0037 ONE OF THOSE WHITE FIRM HANDS WHICH COULD GUIDE THE KNIFE SO WELL AND ANTHONY DEXTER SHUDDERED HE FLUNG THE BOX FAR FROM HIM INTO THE SHRUBBERY WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND SLAMMED THE DOOR HE SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE BUT COULD NOT EAT
5538-70919-0038 THE PAST HAD COME FROM ITS GRAVE VEILED LIKE THE GHOST IN THE GARDEN THAT HE HAD SEEN YESTERDAY IT WAS NOT AN HALLUCINATION THEN ONLY ONE PERSON IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE LAID THOSE DISCOLOURED PEARLS AT HIS DOOR IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
5538-70919-0039 THE BLACK FIGURE IN THE GARDEN WITH THE CHIFFON FLUTTERING ABOUT ITS HEAD WAS EVELINA GREY OR WHAT WAS LEFT OF HER
5538-70919-0040 WHY HE HAD REPEATEDLY TOLD HIMSELF THAT ANY OTHER MAN IN HIS POSITION WOULD DO AS HE HAD DONE YET IT WAS AS THOUGH SOME ONE HAD SLIPPED A STILETTO UNDER HIS ARMOUR AND FOUND A VULNERABLE SPOT BEFORE HIS MENTAL VISION HOVERED TWO WOMEN
5538-70919-0041 ONE WAS A GIRL OF TWENTY LAUGHING EXQUISITELY LOVELY THE OTHER WAS A BENT AND BROKEN WOMAN IN BLACK WHOSE VEIL CONCEALED THE DREADFUL HIDEOUSNESS OF HER FACE PSHAW GRUMBLED DOCTOR DEXTER ALOUD
