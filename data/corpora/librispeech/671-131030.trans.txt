671-131030-0000 TUESDAY FEBRUARY NINETEENTH
671-131030-0001 THE THIRD CHARGE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS THAT IT WILL BE TAKEN FROM THAT CLASS OF CITIZENS WHICH WILL HAVE LEAST SYMPATHY WITH THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE AND BE MOST LIKELY TO AIM AT AN AMBITIOUS SACRIFICE OF THE MANY
671-131030-0002 TO THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF THE FEW OF ALL THE OBJECTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN FRAMED AGAINST THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WHILST THE OBJECTION ITSELF IS LEVELLED AGAINST A PRETENDED OLIGARCHY
671-131030-0003 THE PRINCIPLE OF IT STRIKES AT THE VERY ROOT OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT THE AIM OF EVERY POLITICAL CONSTITUTION IS OR OUGHT TO BE FIRST TO OBTAIN FOR RULERS MEN WHO POSSESS MOST WISDOM TO DISCERN AND MOST VIRTUE TO PURSUE
671-131030-0004 THE COMMON GOOD OF THE SOCIETY AND IN THE NEXT PLACE TO TAKE THE MOST EFFECTUAL PRECAUTIONS FOR KEEPING THEM VIRTUOUS WHILST THEY CONTINUE TO HOLD THEIR PUBLIC TRUST THE ELECTIVE MODE OF OBTAINING RULERS
671-131030-0005 IS THE CHARACTERISTIC POLICY OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT THE MEANS RELIED ON IN THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR PREVENTING THEIR DEGENERACY ARE NUMEROUS AND VARIOUS THE MOST EFFECTUAL ONE
671-131030-0006 IS SUCH A LIMITATION OF THE TERM OF APPOINTMENTS AS WILL MAINTAIN A PROPER RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE LET ME NOW ASK WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE THERE IS IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
671-131030-0007 THAT VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT OR FAVORS THE ELEVATION OF THE FEW ON THE RUINS OF THE MANY LET ME ASK WHETHER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IS NOT ON THE CONTRARY STRICTLY CONFORMABLE TO THESE PRINCIPLES
671-131030-0008 AND SCRUPULOUSLY IMPARTIAL TO THE RIGHTS AND PRETENSIONS OF EVERY CLASS AND DESCRIPTION OF CITIZENS WHO ARE TO BE THE ELECTORS OF THE FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES NOT THE RICH MORE THAN THE POOR NOT THE LEARNED MORE THAN THE IGNORANT
671-131030-0009 NOT THE HAUGHTY HEIRS OF DISTINGUISHED NAMES MORE THAN THE HUMBLE SONS OF OBSCURITY AND UNPROPITIOUS FORTUNE
671-131030-0010 THEY ARE TO BE THE SAME WHO EXERCISE THE RIGHT IN EVERY STATE OF ELECTING THE CORRESPONDING BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE WHO ARE TO BE THE OBJECTS OF POPULAR CHOICE
671-131030-0011 EVERY CITIZEN WHOSE MERIT MAY RECOMMEND HIM TO THE ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE OF HIS COUNTRY NO QUALIFICATION OF WEALTH OF BIRTH OF RELIGIOUS FAITH OR OF CIVIL PROFESSION IS PERMITTED TO FETTER THE JUDGEMENT
671-131030-0012 OR DISAPPOINT THE INCLINATION OF THE PEOPLE IF WE CONSIDER THE SITUATION OF THE MEN ON WHOM THE FREE SUFFRAGES OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS MAY CONFER THE REPRESENTATIVE TRUST
671-131030-0013 WE SHALL FIND IT INVOLVING EVERY SECURITY WHICH CAN BE DEVISED OR DESIRED FOR THEIR FIDELITY TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE
671-131030-0014 WE ARE TO PRESUME THAT IN GENERAL THEY WILL BE SOMEWHAT DISTINGUISHED ALSO BY THOSE QUALITIES WHICH ENTITLE THEM TO IT AND WHICH PROMISE A SINCERE AND SCRUPULOUS REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THEIR ENGAGEMENTS
671-131030-0015 IN THE SECOND PLACE THEY WILL ENTER INTO THE PUBLIC SERVICE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CANNOT FAIL TO PRODUCE A TEMPORARY AFFECTION AT LEAST TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS
671-131030-0016 THERE IS IN EVERY BREAST A SENSIBILITY TO MARKS OF HONOR OF FAVOR OF ESTEEM AND OF CONFIDENCE WHICH APART FROM ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF INTEREST IS SOME PLEDGE FOR GRATEFUL AND BENEVOLENT RETURNS
671-131030-0017 INGRATITUDE IS A COMMON TOPIC OF DECLAMATION AGAINST HUMAN NATURE AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT INSTANCES OF IT ARE BUT TOO FREQUENT AND FLAGRANT BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN PRIVATE LIFE
671-131030-0018 BUT THE UNIVERSAL AND EXTREME INDIGNATION WHICH IT INSPIRES IS ITSELF A PROOF OF THE ENERGY AND PREVALENCE OF THE CONTRARY SENTIMENT IN THE THIRD PLACE THOSE TIES WHICH BIND THE REPRESENTATIVE TO HIS CONSTITUENTS
671-131030-0019 ARE STRENGTHENED BY MOTIVES OF A MORE SELFISH NATURE HIS PRIDE AND VANITY ATTACH HIM TO A FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH FAVORS HIS PRETENSIONS AND GIVES HIM A SHARE IN ITS HONORS AND DISTINCTIONS
671-131030-0020 WHATEVER HOPES OR PROJECTS MIGHT BE ENTERTAINED BY A FEW ASPIRING CHARACTERS IT MUST GENERALLY HAPPEN THAT A GREAT PROPORTION OF THE MEN DERIVING THEIR ADVANCEMENT FROM THEIR INFLUENCE WITH THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MORE TO HOPE FROM A PRESERVATION OF THE FAVOR
671-131030-0021 THAN FROM INNOVATIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT SUBVERSIVE OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE ALL THESE SECURITIES HOWEVER WOULD BE FOUND VERY INSUFFICIENT WITHOUT THE RESTRAINT OF FREQUENT ELECTIONS HENCE IN THE FOURTH PLACE
671-131030-0022 THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS SO CONSTITUTED AS TO SUPPORT IN THE MEMBERS AN HABITUAL RECOLLECTION OF THEIR DEPENDENCE ON THE PEOPLE BEFORE THE SENTIMENTS IMPRESSED ON THEIR MINDS BY THE MODE OF THEIR ELEVATION CAN BE EFFACED BY THE EXERCISE OF POWER
671-131030-0023 THEY WILL BE COMPELLED TO ANTICIPATE THE MOMENT WHEN THEIR POWER IS TO CEASE WHEN THEIR EXERCISE OF IT IS TO BE REVIEWED AND WHEN THEY MUST DESCEND TO THE LEVEL FROM WHICH THEY WERE RAISED THERE FOREVER TO REMAIN UNLESS A FAITHFUL DISCHARGE OF THEIR TRUST
671-131030-0024 I WILL ADD
671-131030-0025 RESTRAINING THEM FROM OPPRESSIVE MEASURES THAT THEY CAN MAKE NO LAW WHICH WILL NOT HAVE ITS FULL OPERATION ON THEMSELVES AND THEIR FRIENDS
671-131030-0026 THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN DEEMED ONE OF THE STRONGEST BONDS BY WHICH HUMAN POLICY CAN CONNECT THE RULERS AND THE PEOPLE TOGETHER IT CREATES BETWEEN THEM THAT COMMUNION OF INTERESTS AND SYMPATHY OF SENTIMENTS OF WHICH FEW GOVERNMENTS HAVE FURNISHED EXAMPLES
671-131030-0027 BUT WITHOUT WHICH EVERY GOVERNMENT DEGENERATES INTO TYRANNY IF IT BE ASKED WHAT IS TO RESTRAIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM MAKING LEGAL DISCRIMINATIONS IN FAVOR OF THEMSELVES AND A PARTICULAR CLASS OF THE SOCIETY I ANSWER
671-131030-0028 THE GENIUS OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM THE NATURE OF JUST AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS AND ABOVE ALL THE VIGILANT AND MANLY SPIRIT WHICH ACTUATES THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA A SPIRIT WHICH NOURISHES FREEDOM AND IN RETURN IS NOURISHED BY IT
671-131030-0029 IF THIS SPIRIT SHALL EVER BE SO FAR DEBASED AS TO TOLERATE A LAW NOT OBLIGATORY ON THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS ON THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WILL BE PREPARED TO TOLERATE ANY THING BUT LIBERTY
671-131030-0030 SUCH WILL BE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS DUTY GRATITUDE INTEREST AMBITION ITSELF ARE THE CHORDS BY WHICH THEY WILL BE BOUND TO FIDELITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THE GREAT MASS OF THE PEOPLE
671-131030-0031 BUT ARE THEY NOT ALL THAT GOVERNMENT WILL ADMIT AND THAT HUMAN PRUDENCE CAN DEVISE ARE THEY NOT THE GENUINE AND THE CHARACTERISTIC MEANS BY WHICH REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT PROVIDES FOR THE LIBERTY AND HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE
671-131030-0032 ARE THEY NOT THE IDENTICAL MEANS ON WHICH EVERY STATE GOVERNMENT IN THE UNION RELIES FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF THESE IMPORTANT ENDS WHAT THEN ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND BY THE OBJECTION WHICH THIS PAPER HAS COMBATED
671-131030-0033 WHAT ARE WE TO SAY TO THE MEN WHO PROFESS THE MOST FLAMING ZEAL FOR REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT YET BOLDLY IMPEACH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF IT WHO PRETEND TO BE CHAMPIONS FOR THE RIGHT AND THE CAPACITY OF THE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN RULERS
671-131030-0034 YET MAINTAIN THAT THEY WILL PREFER THOSE ONLY WHO WILL IMMEDIATELY AND INFALLIBLY BETRAY THE TRUST COMMITTED TO THEM WERE THE OBJECTION TO BE READ BY ONE WHO HAD NOT SEEN THE MODE PRESCRIBED BY THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE CHOICE OF REPRESENTATIVES
671-131030-0035 HE COULD SUPPOSE NOTHING LESS THAN THAT SOME UNREASONABLE QUALIFICATION OF PROPERTY WAS ANNEXED TO THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE OR THAT THE RIGHT OF ELIGIBILITY WAS LIMITED TO PERSONS OF PARTICULAR FAMILIES OR FORTUNES
671-131030-0036 OR AT LEAST THAT THE MODE PRESCRIBED BY THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS WAS IN SOME RESPECT OR OTHER VERY GROSSLY DEPARTED FROM WE HAVE SEEN HOW FAR SUCH A SUPPOSITION WOULD ERR
671-131030-0037 NOR WOULD IT IN FACT BE LESS ERRONEOUS AS TO THE LAST THE ONLY DIFFERENCE DISCOVERABLE BETWEEN THE TWO CASES IS THAT EACH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE ELECTED BY FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND CITIZENS WHILST IN THE INDIVIDUAL STATES
671-131030-0038 THE ELECTION OF A REPRESENTATIVE IS LEFT TO ABOUT AS MANY HUNDREDS
671-131030-0039 AND AN ABHORRENCE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF THIS BE THE POINT ON WHICH THE OBJECTION TURNS IT DESERVES TO BE EXAMINED IS IT SUPPORTED BY REASON THIS CANNOT BE SAID WITHOUT MAINTAINING THAT FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND CITIZENS
671-131030-0040 ARE LESS CAPABLE OF CHOOSING A FIT REPRESENTATIVE OR MORE LIABLE TO BE CORRUPTED BY AN UNFIT ONE THAN FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED REASON ON THE CONTRARY ASSURES US THAT AS IN SO GREAT A NUMBER A FIT REPRESENTATIVE WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND
671-131030-0041 SO THE CHOICE WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO BE DIVERTED FROM HIM
671-131030-0042 IS THE CONSEQUENCE FROM THIS DOCTRINE ADMISSIBLE IF WE SAY THAT FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED CITIZENS ARE AS MANY AS CAN JOINTLY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE MUST WE NOT DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE IMMEDIATE CHOICE OF THEIR PUBLIC SERVANTS
671-131030-0043 IN EVERY INSTANCE WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE AS MANY OF THEM AS WILL AMOUNT TO ONE FOR THAT NUMBER OF CITIZENS IS THE DOCTRINE WARRANTED BY FACTS IT WAS SHOWN IN THE LAST PAPER
671-131030-0044 THAT THE REAL REPRESENTATION IN THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS VERY LITTLE EXCEEDS THE PROPORTION OF ONE FOR EVERY THIRTY THOUSAND INHABITANTS BESIDES A VARIETY OF POWERFUL CAUSES NOT EXISTING HERE AND WHICH FAVOR IN THAT COUNTRY
671-131030-0045 THE PRETENSIONS OF RANK AND WEALTH NO PERSON IS ELIGIBLE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A COUNTY UNLESS HE POSSESS REAL ESTATE OF THE CLEAR VALUE OF SIX HUNDRED POUNDS STERLING PER YEAR NOR OF A CITY OR BOROUGH UNLESS HE POSSESS A LIKE ESTATE
671-131030-0046 OF HALF THAT ANNUAL VALUE TO THIS QUALIFICATION ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES IS ADDED ANOTHER ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY ELECTORS WHICH RESTRAINS THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE TO PERSONS HAVING A FREEHOLD ESTATE OF THE ANNUAL VALUE
671-131030-0047 OF MORE THAN TWENTY POUNDS STERLING ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT RATE OF MONEY NOTWITHSTANDING THESE UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOTWITHSTANDING SOME VERY UNEQUAL LAWS IN THE BRITISH CODE
671-131030-0048 IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION HAVE ELEVATED THE FEW ON THE RUINS OF THE MANY BUT WE NEED NOT RESORT TO FOREIGN EXPERIENCE ON THIS SUBJECT OUR OWN IS EXPLICIT AND DECISIVE
671-131030-0049 THE DISTRICTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN WHICH THE SENATORS ARE CHOSEN IMMEDIATELY BY THE PEOPLE ARE NEARLY AS LARGE AS WILL BE NECESSARY FOR HER REPRESENTATIVES IN THE CONGRESS THOSE OF MASSACHUSETTS ARE LARGER THAN WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THAT PURPOSE
671-131030-0050 AND THOSE OF NEW YORK STILL MORE SO IN THE LAST STATE THE MEMBERS OF ASSEMBLY FOR THE CITIES AND COUNTIES OF NEW YORK AND ALBANY ARE ELECTED BY VERY NEARLY AS MANY VOTERS AS WILL BE ENTITLED TO A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE CONGRESS
671-131030-0051 CALCULATING ON THE NUMBER OF SIXTY FIVE REPRESENTATIVES ONLY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THAT IN THESE SENATORIAL DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES A NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES ARE VOTED FOR BY EACH ELECTOR AT THE SAME TIME
671-131030-0052 IF THE SAME ELECTORS AT THE SAME TIME ARE CAPABLE OF CHOOSING FOUR OR FIVE REPRESENTATIVES THEY CANNOT BE INCAPABLE OF CHOOSING ONE PENNSYLVANIA IS AN ADDITIONAL EXAMPLE SOME OF HER COUNTIES WHICH ELECT HER STATE REPRESENTATIVES
671-131030-0053 ARE ALMOST AS LARGE AS HER DISTRICTS WILL BE BY WHICH HER FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE ELECTED THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA IS SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY THOUSAND SOULS IT WILL THEREFORE FORM NEARLY TWO DISTRICTS FOR THE CHOICE OF FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES
671-131030-0054 IT FORMS HOWEVER BUT ONE COUNTY IN WHICH EVERY ELECTOR VOTES FOR EACH OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT MAY APPEAR TO BE STILL MORE DIRECTLY TO OUR PURPOSE THE WHOLE CITY ACTUALLY ELECTS A SINGLE MEMBER
671-131030-0055 FOR THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL THIS IS THE CASE IN ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES OF THE STATE ARE NOT THESE FACTS THE MOST SATISFACTORY PROOFS OF THE FALLACY WHICH HAS BEEN EMPLOYED AGAINST THE BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER CONSIDERATION
671-131030-0056 HAS IT APPEARED ON TRIAL THAT THE SENATORS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW YORK OR THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF PENNSYLVANIA OR THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY
671-131030-0057 HAVE BETRAYED ANY PECULIAR DISPOSITION TO SACRIFICE THE MANY TO THE FEW OR ARE IN ANY RESPECT LESS WORTHY OF THEIR PLACES THAN THE REPRESENTATIVES AND MAGISTRATES APPOINTED IN OTHER STATES BY VERY SMALL DIVISIONS OF THE PEOPLE
671-131030-0058 BUT THERE ARE CASES OF A STRONGER COMPLEXION THAN ANY WHICH I HAVE YET QUOTED ONE BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE OF CONNECTICUT IS SO CONSTITUTED THAT EACH MEMBER OF IT IS ELECTED BY THE WHOLE STATE
671-131030-0059 SO IS THE GOVERNOR OF THAT STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND OF THIS STATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE I LEAVE EVERY MAN TO DECIDE WHETHER THE RESULT OF ANY ONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE SAID TO COUNTENANCE A SUSPICION
