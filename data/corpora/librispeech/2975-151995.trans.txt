2975-151995-0000 SAID LUCY SHE WAS KNEELING ON A FOOTSTOOL AT MAGGIE'S FEET AFTER PLACING THAT DARK LADY IN THE LARGE CRIMSON VELVET CHAIR I FEEL SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM I HOPE YOU WILL I SHALL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PLEASE SAID MAGGIE SMILING
2975-151995-0001 AND HOLDING UP ONE OF LUCY'S LONG CURLS THAT THE SUNLIGHT MIGHT SHINE THROUGH IT A GENTLEMAN WHO THINKS HE IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR LUCY MUST EXPECT TO BE SHARPLY CRITICISED INDEED HE'S A GREAT DEAL TOO GOOD FOR ME AND SOMETIMES WHEN HE IS AWAY
2975-151995-0002 BUT I CAN NEVER DOUBT IT WHEN HE IS WITH ME THOUGH I COULDN'T BEAR ANY ONE BUT YOU TO KNOW THAT I FEEL IN THAT WAY MAGGIE OH THEN IF I DISAPPROVE OF HIM YOU CAN GIVE HIM UP
2975-151995-0003 SAID MAGGIE WITH PLAYFUL GRAVITY I WOULD RATHER NOT BE ENGAGED WHEN PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED THEY BEGIN TO THINK OF BEING MARRIED SOON SAID LUCY TOO THOROUGHLY PREOCCUPIED TO NOTICE MAGGIE'S JOKE
2975-151995-0004 AND I SHOULD LIKE EVERYTHING TO GO ON FOR A LONG WHILE JUST AS IT IS
2975-151995-0005 AND FROM SOMETHING THAT FELL FROM PAPA THE OTHER DAY I FEEL SURE HE AND MISTER GUEST ARE EXPECTING THAT AND STEPHEN'S SISTERS ARE VERY CIVIL TO ME NOW
2975-151995-0006 AND THAT WAS NATURAL IT DOES SEEM OUT OF KEEPING THAT I SHOULD EVER LIVE IN A GREAT PLACE LIKE THE PARK HOUSE SUCH A LITTLE INSIGNIFICANT THING AS I AM
2975-151995-0007 BUT PEOPLE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE LARGE IN PROPORTION TO THE HOUSES THEY LIVE IN LIKE SNAILS SAID MAGGIE LAUGHING PRAY ARE MISTER GUEST'S SISTERS GIANTESSES OH NO
2975-151995-0008 THOUGH YOU ARE UNABLE TO SHARE THAT OPINION
2975-151995-0009 SAID LUCY BLUSHING PINK OVER BROW AND NECK IT IS A BAD PLAN TO RAISE EXPECTATION YOU WILL PERHAPS BE DISAPPOINTED BUT I HAVE PREPARED A CHARMING SURPRISE FOR HIM I SHALL HAVE A GLORIOUS LAUGH AGAINST HIM
2975-151995-0010 I SHALL NOT TELL YOU WHAT IT IS THOUGH LUCY ROSE FROM HER KNEES AND WENT TO A LITTLE DISTANCE HOLDING HER PRETTY HEAD ON ONE SIDE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ARRANGING MAGGIE FOR A PORTRAIT AND WISHED TO JUDGE OF THE GENERAL EFFECT STAND UP A MOMENT MAGGIE
2975-151995-0011 WHAT IS YOUR PLEASURE NOW SAID MAGGIE SMILING LANGUIDLY AS SHE ROSE FROM HER CHAIR AND LOOKED DOWN ON HER SLIGHT AERIAL COUSIN WHOSE FIGURE WAS QUITE SUBORDINATE TO HER FAULTLESS DRAPERY OF SILK AND CRAPE
2975-151995-0012 LUCY KEPT HER CONTEMPLATIVE ATTITUDE A MOMENT OR TWO IN SILENCE AND THEN SAID I CAN'T THINK WHAT WITCHERY IT IS IN YOU MAGGIE THAT MAKES YOU LOOK BEST IN SHABBY CLOTHES THOUGH YOU REALLY MUST HAVE A NEW DRESS NOW BUT DO YOU KNOW
2975-151995-0013 LAST NIGHT I WAS TRYING TO FANCY YOU IN A HANDSOME FASHIONABLE DRESS AND DO WHAT I WOULD THAT OLD LIMP MERINO WOULD COME BACK AS THE ONLY RIGHT THING FOR YOU I WONDER IF MARIE ANTOINETTE LOOKED ALL THE GRANDER WHEN HER GOWN WAS DARNED AT THE ELBOWS
2975-151995-0014 I SHOULD BE A MERE RAG OH QUITE SAID MAGGIE WITH MOCK GRAVITY YOU WOULD BE LIABLE TO BE SWEPT OUT OF THE ROOM WITH THE COBWEBS AND CARPET DUST AND TO FIND YOURSELF UNDER THE GRATE LIKE CINDERELLA MAYN'T I SIT DOWN NOW
2975-151995-0015 YES NOW YOU MAY SAID LUCY LAUGHING THEN WITH AN AIR OF SERIOUS REFLECTION UNFASTENING HER LARGE JET BROOCH BUT YOU MUST CHANGE BROOCHES MAGGIE THAT LITTLE BUTTERFLY LOOKS SILLY ON YOU
2975-151995-0016 BUT WON'T THAT MAR THE CHARMING EFFECT OF MY CONSISTENT SHABBINESS SAID MAGGIE SEATING HERSELF SUBMISSIVELY WHILE LUCY KNELT AGAIN AND UNFASTENED THE CONTEMPTIBLE BUTTERFLY I WISH MY MOTHER WERE OF YOUR OPINION
2975-151995-0017 I'VE BEEN SAVING MY MONEY TO PAY FOR SOME LESSONS I SHALL NEVER GET A BETTER SITUATION WITHOUT MORE ACCOMPLISHMENTS MAGGIE GAVE A LITTLE SIGH NOW DON'T PUT ON THAT SAD LOOK AGAIN SAID LUCY
2975-151995-0018 PINNING THE LARGE BROOCH BELOW MAGGIE'S FINE THROAT YOU'RE FORGETTING THAT YOU'VE LEFT THAT DREARY SCHOOLROOM BEHIND YOU AND HAVE NO LITTLE GIRLS CLOTHES TO MEND YES SAID MAGGIE
2975-151995-0019 IT IS WITH ME AS I USED TO THINK IT WOULD BE WITH THE POOR UNEASY WHITE BEAR I SAW AT THE SHOW I THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE GOT SO STUPID WITH THE HABIT OF TURNING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN THAT NARROW SPACE
2975-151995-0020 THAT HE WOULD KEEP DOING IT IF THEY SET HIM FREE ONE GETS A BAD HABIT OF BEING UNHAPPY
2975-151995-0021 SAID LUCY STICKING THE BLACK BUTTERFLY ABSENTLY IN HER OWN COLLAR WHILE HER EYES MET MAGGIE'S AFFECTIONATELY
2975-151995-0022 DEAR TINY THING SAID MAGGIE IN ONE OF HER BURSTS OF LOVING ADMIRATION YOU ENJOY OTHER PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS SO MUCH I BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO WITHOUT ANY OF YOUR OWN
2975-151995-0023 I'VE NEVER BEEN TRIED IN THAT WAY SAID LUCY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO HAPPY I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I COULD BEAR MUCH TROUBLE I NEVER HAD ANY BUT POOR MAMMA'S DEATH YOU HAVE BEEN TRIED MAGGIE
2975-151995-0024 AND I'M SURE YOU FEEL FOR OTHER PEOPLE QUITE AS MUCH AS I DO NO LUCY SAID MAGGIE SHAKING HER HEAD SLOWLY I DON'T ENJOY THEIR HAPPINESS AS YOU DO ELSE I SHOULD BE MORE CONTENTED I DO FEEL FOR THEM WHEN THEY ARE IN TROUBLE
2975-151995-0025 I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER BEAR TO MAKE ANY ONE UN HAPPY AND YET I OFTEN HATE MYSELF
2975-151995-0026 I THINK I GET WORSE AS I GET OLDER MORE SELFISH
2975-151995-0027 NOW MAGGIE SAID LUCY IN A TONE OF REMONSTRANCE I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF THAT IT IS ALL A GLOOMY FANCY
2975-151995-0028 WELL PERHAPS IT IS SAID MAGGIE RESOLUTELY CLEARING AWAY THE CLOUDS FROM HER FACE WITH A BRIGHT SMILE AND THROWING HERSELF BACKWARD IN HER CHAIR PERHAPS IT COMES FROM THE SCHOOL DIET
2975-151995-0029 WATERY RICE PUDDING SPICED WITH PINNOCK LET US HOPE IT WILL GIVE WAY BEFORE MY MOTHER'S CUSTARDS AND THIS CHARMING GEOFFREY CRAYON MAGGIE TOOK UP THE SKETCH BOOK WHICH LAY BY HER ON THE TABLE
2975-151995-0030 DO I LOOK FIT TO BE SEEN WITH THIS LITTLE BROOCH SAID LUCY GOING TO SURVEY THE EFFECT IN THE CHIMNEY GLASS OH NO MISTER GUEST WILL BE OBLIGED TO GO OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN IF HE SEES YOU IN IT PRAY MAKE HASTE AND PUT ANOTHER ON
2975-151995-0031 LUCY HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM BUT MAGGIE DID NOT TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF OPENING HER BOOK SHE LET IT FALL ON HER KNEES WHILE HER EYES WANDERED TO THE WINDOW WHERE SHE COULD SEE THE SUNSHINE FALLING ON THE RICH CLUMPS OF SPRING FLOWERS AND ON THE LONG HEDGE OF LAURELS
2975-151995-0032 AND BEYOND THE SILVERY BREADTH OF THE DEAR OLD FLOSS THAT AT THIS DISTANCE SEEMED TO BE SLEEPING IN A MORNING HOLIDAY THE SWEET FRESH GARDEN SCENT CAME THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AND THE BIRDS WERE BUSY FLITTING AND ALIGHTING
2975-151995-0033 GURGLING AND SINGING YET MAGGIE'S EYES BEGAN TO FILL WITH TEARS THE SIGHT OF THE OLD SCENES HAD MADE THE RUSH OF MEMORIES SO PAINFUL THAT EVEN YESTERDAY SHE HAD ONLY BEEN ABLE TO REJOICE IN HER MOTHER'S RESTORED COMFORT AND TOM'S BROTHERLY FRIENDLINESS
2975-151995-0034 AS WE REJOICE IN GOOD NEWS OF FRIENDS AT A DISTANCE RATHER THAN IN THE PRESENCE OF A HAPPINESS WHICH WE SHARE MEMORY AND IMAGINATION URGED UPON HER A SENSE OF PRIVATION TOO KEEN TO LET HER TASTE WHAT WAS OFFERED IN THE TRANSIENT PRESENT
2975-151995-0035 HER FUTURE SHE THOUGHT WAS LIKELY TO BE WORSE THAN HER PAST FOR AFTER HER YEARS OF CONTENTED RENUNCIATION SHE HAD SLIPPED BACK INTO DESIRE AND LONGING SHE FOUND JOYLESS DAYS OF DISTASTEFUL OCCUPATION HARDER AND HARDER
2975-151995-0036 SHE FOUND THE IMAGE OF THE INTENSE AND VARIED LIFE SHE YEARNED FOR AND DESPAIRED OF BECOMING MORE AND MORE IMPORTUNATE THE SOUND OF THE OPENING DOOR ROUSED HER AND HASTILY WIPING AWAY HER TEARS SHE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES OF HER BOOK
2975-151995-0037 THERE IS ONE PLEASURE I KNOW MAGGIE THAT YOUR DEEPEST DISMALNESS WILL NEVER RESIST SAID LUCY BEGINNING TO SPEAK AS SOON AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM THAT IS MUSIC
2975-151995-0038 I MEAN YOU TO GET UP YOUR PLAYING AGAIN WHICH USED TO BE SO MUCH BETTER THAN MINE WHEN WE WERE AT LACEHAM
2975-151995-0039 WHEN I TOOK THEM TO PRACTISE SAID MAGGIE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF FINGERING THE DEAR KEYS AGAIN BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I COULD PLAY ANYTHING MORE DIFFICULT NOW THAN BEGONE DULL CARE
2975-151995-0040 I KNOW WHAT A WILD STATE OF JOY YOU USED TO BE IN WHEN THE GLEE MEN CAME ROUND SAID LUCY TAKING UP HER EMBROIDERY AND WE MIGHT HAVE ALL THOSE OLD GLEES THAT YOU USED TO LOVE SO IF I WERE CERTAIN THAT YOU
2975-151995-0041 SOME THINGS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING YOU MIGHT BE MORE CERTAIN OF SAID MAGGIE SMILING
2975-151995-0042 ONE PARTICULAR THING BECAUSE IF YOU FEEL JUST AS HE DOES ABOUT THAT WE SHALL WANT OUR THIRD VOICE SAINT OGG'S IS SO MISERABLY PROVIDED WITH MUSICAL GENTLEMEN THERE ARE REALLY ONLY STEPHEN
2975-151995-0043 WHO HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SING A PART LUCY HAD LOOKED UP FROM HER WORK AS SHE UTTERED THE LAST SENTENCE AND SAW THAT THERE WAS A CHANGE IN MAGGIE'S FACE DOES IT HURT YOU TO HEAR THE NAME MENTIONED MAGGIE
2975-151995-0044 IF IT DOES I WILL NOT SPEAK OF HIM AGAIN I KNOW TOM WILL NOT SEE HIM IF HE CAN AVOID IT I DON'T FEEL AT ALL AS TOM DOES ON THAT SUBJECT SAID MAGGIE RISING AND GOING TO THE WINDOW AS IF SHE WANTED TO SEE MORE OF THE LANDSCAPE
2975-151995-0045 I'VE ALWAYS LIKED PHILIP WAKEM EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL AND SAW HIM AT LORTON HE WAS SO GOOD WHEN TOM HURT HIS FOOT OH I'M SO GLAD SAID LUCY THEN YOU WON'T MIND HIS COMING SOMETIMES
2975-151995-0046 AND WE CAN HAVE MUCH MORE MUSIC THAN WE COULD WITHOUT HIM I'M VERY FOND OF POOR PHILIP ONLY I WISH HE WERE NOT SO MORBID ABOUT HIS DEFORMITY I SUPPOSE IT IS HIS DEFORMITY THAT MAKES HIM SO SAD AND SOMETIMES BITTER
2975-151995-0047 IT IS CERTAINLY VERY PITEOUS TO SEE HIS POOR LITTLE CROOKED BODY AND PALE FACE AMONG GREAT STRONG PEOPLE BUT
2975-151995-0048 SAID MAGGIE TRYING TO ARREST THE PRATTLING STREAM AH THERE IS THE DOOR BELL THAT MUST BE STEPHEN LUCY WENT ON NOT NOTICING MAGGIE'S FAINT EFFORT TO SPEAK ONE OF THE THINGS I MOST ADMIRE IN STEPHEN IS THAT HE MAKES A GREATER FRIEND OF PHILIP THAN ANY ONE
2975-151995-0049 THIS IS MISTER STEPHEN GUEST FOR ONE INSTANT STEPHEN COULD NOT CONCEAL HIS ASTONISHMENT AT THE SIGHT OF THIS TALL DARK EYED NYMPH WITH HER JET BLACK CORONET OF HAIR THE NEXT MAGGIE FELT HERSELF
2975-151995-0050 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE RECEIVING THE TRIBUTE OF A VERY DEEP BLUSH AND A VERY DEEP BOW
2975-151995-0051 THIS NEW EXPERIENCE WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HER SO AGREEABLE THAT IT ALMOST EFFACED HER PREVIOUS EMOTION ABOUT PHILIP THERE WAS A NEW BRIGHTNESS IN HER EYES AND A VERY BECOMING FLUSH ON HER CHEEK AS SHE SEATED HERSELF
2975-151995-0052 I HOPE YOU PERCEIVE WHAT A STRIKING LIKENESS YOU DREW THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SAID LUCY WITH A PRETTY LAUGH OF TRIUMPH SHE ENJOYED HER LOVER'S CONFUSION THE ADVANTAGE WAS USUALLY ON HIS SIDE
2975-151995-0053 THIS DESIGNING COUSIN OF YOURS QUITE DECEIVED ME MISS TULLIVER SAID STEPHEN SEATING HIMSELF BY LUCY AND STOOPING TO PLAY WITH MINNY ONLY LOOKING AT MAGGIE FURTIVELY SHE SAID YOU HAD LIGHT HAIR AND BLUE EYES
2975-151995-0054 NAY IT WAS YOU WHO SAID SO REMONSTRATED LUCY I ONLY REFRAINED FROM DESTROYING YOUR CONFIDENCE IN YOUR OWN SECOND SIGHT I WISH I COULD ALWAYS ERR IN THE SAME WAY SAID STEPHEN
2975-151995-0055 AND FIND REALITY SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MY PRECONCEPTIONS NOW YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF EQUAL TO THE OCCASION SAID MAGGIE AND SAID WHAT IT WAS INCUMBENT ON YOU TO SAY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
2975-151995-0056 IT WAS CLEAR TO HER THAT HE HAD BEEN DRAWING A SATIRICAL PORTRAIT OF HER BEFOREHAND LUCY HAD SAID HE WAS INCLINED TO BE SATIRICAL AND MAGGIE HAD MENTALLY SUPPLIED THE ADDITION AND RATHER CONCEITED AN ALARMING AMOUNT OF DEVIL THERE
2975-151995-0057 WAS STEPHEN'S FIRST THOUGHT THE SECOND WHEN SHE HAD BENT OVER HER WORK WAS I WISH SHE WOULD LOOK AT ME AGAIN THE NEXT WAS TO ANSWER I SUPPOSE ALL PHRASES OF MERE COMPLIMENT HAVE THEIR TURN TO BE TRUE
2975-151995-0058 A MAN IS OCCASIONALLY GRATEFUL WHEN HE SAYS THANK YOU IT'S RATHER HARD UPON HIM THAT HE MUST USE THE SAME WORDS WITH WHICH ALL THE WORLD DECLINES A DISAGREEABLE INVITATION DON'T YOU THINK SO MISS TULLIVER NO SAID MAGGIE
2975-151995-0059 LOOKING AT HIM WITH HER DIRECT GLANCE IF WE USE COMMON WORDS ON A GREAT OCCASION THEY ARE THE MORE STRIKING BECAUSE THEY ARE FELT AT ONCE TO HAVE A PARTICULAR MEANING LIKE OLD BANNERS OR EVERY DAY CLOTHES HUNG UP IN A SACRED PLACE
2975-151995-0060 THEN MY COMPLIMENT OUGHT TO BE ELOQUENT SAID STEPHEN REALLY NOT QUITE KNOWING WHAT HE SAID WHILE MAGGIE LOOKED AT HIM SEEING THAT THE WORDS WERE SO FAR BENEATH THE OCCASION NO COMPLIMENT CAN BE ELOQUENT
2975-151995-0061 EXCEPT AS AN EXPRESSION OF INDIFFERENCE SAID MAGGIE FLUSHING A LITTLE LUCY WAS RATHER ALARMED SHE THOUGHT STEPHEN AND MAGGIE WERE NOT GOING TO LIKE EACH OTHER SHE HAD ALWAYS FEARED LEST MAGGIE SHOULD APPEAR
2975-151995-0062 TOO OLD AND CLEVER TO PLEASE THAT CRITICAL GENTLEMAN WHY DEAR MAGGIE SHE INTERPOSED YOU HAVE ALWAYS PRETENDED THAT YOU ARE TOO FOND OF BEING ADMIRED AND NOW I THINK YOU ARE ANGRY BECAUSE SOME ONE VENTURES TO ADMIRE YOU
2975-151995-0063 NOT AT ALL SAID MAGGIE I LIKE TOO WELL TO FEEL THAT I AM ADMIRED BUT COMPLIMENTS NEVER MAKE ME FEEL THAT I WILL NEVER PAY YOU A COMPLIMENT AGAIN MISS TULLIVER SAID STEPHEN THANK YOU THAT WILL BE A PROOF OF RESPECT
2975-151995-0064 POOR MAGGIE SHE WAS SO UNUSED TO SOCIETY THAT SHE COULD TAKE NOTHING AS A MATTER OF COURSE
2975-151995-0065 FROM THE EXCESSIVE FEELING SHE WAS APT TO THROW INTO VERY TRIVIAL INCIDENTS BUT SHE WAS EVEN CONSCIOUS HERSELF OF A LITTLE ABSURDITY IN THIS INSTANCE
2975-151995-0066 AND HAD ONCE SAID IMPATIENTLY TO PHILIP THAT SHE DIDN'T SEE WHY WOMEN WERE TO BE TOLD WITH A SIMPER THAT THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL ANY MORE THAN OLD MEN WERE TO BE TOLD THAT THEY WERE VENERABLE STILL
2975-151995-0067 AND TO CARE ABOUT HIS HAVING SPOKEN SLIGHTINGLY OF HER BEFORE HE HAD SEEN HER WAS CERTAINLY UNREASONABLE AND AS SOON AS SHE WAS SILENT SHE BEGAN TO BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER THAT HER IRRITATION
2975-151995-0068 WAS DUE TO THE PLEASANTER EMOTION WHICH PRECEDED IT JUST AS WHEN WE ARE SATISFIED WITH A SENSE OF GLOWING WARMTH
2975-151995-0069 STEPHEN WAS TOO WELL BRED NOT TO SEEM UNAWARE THAT THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION COULD HAVE BEEN FELT EMBARRASSING AND AT ONCE BEGAN TO TALK OF IMPERSONAL MATTERS ASKING LUCY IF SHE KNEW WHEN THE BAZAAR WAS AT LENGTH TO TAKE PLACE
2975-151995-0070 SO THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME HOPE OF SEEING HER RAIN THE INFLUENCE OF HER EYES
2975-151995-0071 SOME DAY NEXT MONTH I BELIEVE SAID LUCY
2975-151995-0072 BUT THEY CARRY ON THEIR MANUFACTURES IN THEIR OWN SITTING ROOM WHERE I DON'T INTRUDE ON THEM I SEE YOU ARE NOT ADDICTED TO THE FASHIONABLE VICE OF FANCY WORK MISS TULLIVER SAID STEPHEN LOOKING AT MAGGIE'S PLAIN HEMMING NO SAID MAGGIE
2975-151995-0073 I CAN DO NOTHING MORE DIFFICULT OR MORE ELEGANT THAN SHIRT MAKING AND YOUR PLAIN SEWING IS SO BEAUTIFUL MAGGIE SAID LUCY THAT I THINK I SHALL BEG A FEW SPECIMENS OF YOU TO SHOW AS FANCY WORK YOUR EXQUISITE SEWING
2975-151995-0074 YOU USED TO DISLIKE THAT SORT OF WORK SO MUCH IN OLD DAYS IT IS A MYSTERY EASILY EXPLAINED DEAR SAID MAGGIE LOOKING UP QUIETLY PLAIN SEWING WAS THE ONLY THING I COULD GET MONEY BY SO I WAS OBLIGED TO TRY AND DO IT WELL
2975-151995-0075 LUCY GOOD AND SIMPLE AS SHE WAS COULD NOT HELP BLUSHING A LITTLE SHE DID NOT QUITE LIKE THAT STEPHEN SHOULD KNOW THAT MAGGIE NEED NOT HAVE MENTIONED IT PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME PRIDE IN THE CONFESSION THE PRIDE OF POVERTY
2975-151995-0076 THAT WILL NOT BE ASHAMED OF ITSELF BUT IF MAGGIE HAD BEEN THE QUEEN OF COQUETTES SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE INVENTED A MEANS OF GIVING GREATER PIQUANCY TO HER BEAUTY IN STEPHEN'S EYES
2975-151995-0077 BUT ASSISTED BY THE BEAUTY THEY MADE MAGGIE MORE UNLIKE OTHER WOMEN
2975-151995-0078 BUT I CAN KNIT LUCY MAGGIE WENT ON IF THAT WILL BE OF ANY USE FOR YOUR BAZAAR OH YES OF INFINITE USE I SHALL SET YOU TO WORK WITH SCARLET WOOL TO MORROW BUT YOUR SISTER IS THE MOST ENVIABLE PERSON
2975-151995-0079 CONTINUED LUCY TURNING TO STEPHEN TO HAVE THE TALENT OF MODELLING SHE IS DOING A WONDERFUL BUST OF DOCTOR KENN ENTIRELY FROM MEMORY WHY IF SHE CAN REMEMBER TO PUT THE EYES VERY NEAR TOGETHER AND THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH VERY FAR APART
2975-151995-0080 NOW THAT IS VERY WICKED OF YOU SAID LUCY LOOKING RATHER HURT I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF DOCTOR KENN I SAY ANYTHING DISRESPECTFUL OF DOCTOR KENN HEAVEN FORBID
2975-151995-0081 I DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT THE TALL CANDLESTICKS HE HAS PUT ON THE COMMUNION TABLE AND I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO SPOIL MY TEMPER BY GETTING UP TO EARLY PRAYERS EVERY MORNING BUT HE'S THE ONLY MAN I EVER KNEW PERSONALLY
2975-151995-0082 WHO SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE ANYTHING OF THE REAL APOSTLE IN HIM A MAN WHO HAS EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR AND IS CONTENTED WITH DEAL FURNITURE AND BOILED BEEF
2975-151995-0083 THAT WAS A VERY FINE THING OF HIM TAKING INTO HIS HOUSE THAT POOR LAD GRATTAN WHO SHOT HIS MOTHER BY ACCIDENT HE SACRIFICES MORE TIME THAN A LESS BUSY MAN COULD SPARE
2975-151995-0084 THAT IS BEAUTIFUL SAID MAGGIE WHO HAD LET HER WORK FALL AND WAS LISTENING WITH KEEN INTEREST I NEVER KNEW ANY ONE WHO DID SUCH THINGS AND ONE ADMIRES THAT SORT OF ACTION IN KENN ALL THE MORE
2975-151995-0085 SAID STEPHEN BECAUSE HIS MANNERS IN GENERAL ARE RATHER COLD AND SEVERE THERE'S NOTHING SUGARY AND MAUDLIN ABOUT HIM OH I THINK HE'S A PERFECT CHARACTER SAID LUCY WITH PRETTY ENTHUSIASM NO
2975-151995-0086 THERE I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU SAID STEPHEN SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH SARCASTIC GRAVITY
2975-151995-0087 WELL THOSE ARE THE RIGHT VIEWS I THINK SAID LUCY GRAVELY THAT SETTLES THE QUESTION IN THE ABSTRACT SAID STEPHEN
2975-151995-0088 HE HAS SET THE DISSENTERS AND THE CHURCH PEOPLE BY THE EARS AND A RISING SENATOR LIKE MYSELF OF WHOSE SERVICES THE COUNTRY IS VERY MUCH IN NEED
2975-151995-0089 DO YOU REALLY THINK OF THAT SAID LUCY HER EYES BRIGHTENING WITH A PROUD PLEASURE THAT MADE HER NEGLECT THE ARGUMENTATIVE INTERESTS OF ANGLICANISM DECIDEDLY
2975-151995-0090 WHENEVER OLD MISTER LEYBURN'S PUBLIC SPIRIT AND GOUT INDUCE HIM TO GIVE WAY MY FATHER'S HEART IS SET ON IT AND GIFTS LIKE MINE YOU KNOW
2975-151995-0091 AND RUBBED HIS LARGE WHITE HANDS OVER HIS HAIR WITH PLAYFUL SELF ADMIRATION
2975-151995-0092 DON'T YOU THINK SO MISS TULLIVER YES SAID MAGGIE SMILING BUT NOT LOOKING UP SO MUCH FLUENCY AND SELF POSSESSION SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ENTIRELY ON PRIVATE OCCASIONS AH I SEE HOW MUCH PENETRATION YOU HAVE SAID STEPHEN
2975-151995-0093 NOW SUPERFICIAL PEOPLE NEVER DISCERN THAT OWING TO MY MANNER I SUPPOSE SHE DOESN'T LOOK AT ME WHEN I TALK OF MYSELF HE THOUGHT
2975-151995-0094 I MUST TRY OTHER SUBJECTS DID LUCY INTEND TO BE PRESENT AT THE MEETING OF THE BOOK CLUB NEXT WEEK WAS THE NEXT QUESTION THEN FOLLOWED THE RECOMMENDATION TO CHOOSE SOUTHEY'S LIFE OF COWPER UNLESS SHE WERE INCLINED TO BE PHILOSOPHICAL
2975-151995-0095 AND STARTLE THE LADIES OF SAINT OGG'S BY VOTING FOR ONE OF THE BRIDGEWATER TREATISES OF COURSE LUCY WISHED TO KNOW WHAT THESE ALARMINGLY LEARNED BOOKS WERE AND AS IT IS ALWAYS PLEASANT TO IMPROVE THE MINDS OF LADIES
2975-151995-0096 BY TALKING TO THEM AT EASE ON SUBJECTS OF WHICH THEY KNOW NOTHING STEPHEN BECAME QUITE BRILLIANT IN AN ACCOUNT OF BUCKLAND'S TREATISE WHICH HE HAD JUST BEEN READING
2975-151995-0097 AND GRADUALLY GET SO ABSORBED IN HIS WONDERFUL GEOLOGICAL STORY THAT SHE SAT LOOKING AT HIM
2975-151995-0098 AND SHE A DOWNY LIPPED ALUMNA HE WAS SO FASCINATED BY THE CLEAR LARGE GAZE THAT AT LAST HE FORGOT TO LOOK AWAY FROM IT OCCASIONALLY TOWARD LUCY BUT SHE SWEET CHILD WAS ONLY REJOICING THAT STEPHEN WAS PROVING TO MAGGIE HOW CLEVER HE WAS
2975-151995-0099 AND THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE GOOD FRIENDS AFTER ALL I WILL BRING YOU THE BOOK SHALL I MISS TULLIVER SAID STEPHEN WHEN HE FOUND THE STREAM OF HIS RECOLLECTIONS RUNNING RATHER SHALLOW THERE ARE MANY ILLUSTRATIONS IN IT THAT YOU WILL LIKE TO SEE OH THANK YOU SAID MAGGIE
2975-151995-0100 BLUSHING WITH RETURNING SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AT THIS DIRECT ADDRESS AND TAKING UP HER WORK AGAIN NO NO LUCY INTERPOSED I MUST FORBID YOUR PLUNGING MAGGIE IN BOOKS I SHALL NEVER GET HER AWAY FROM THEM AND I WANT HER TO HAVE DELICIOUS DO NOTHING DAYS
2975-151995-0101 FILLED WITH BOATING AND CHATTING AND RIDING AND DRIVING THAT IS THE HOLIDAY SHE NEEDS APROPOS SAID STEPHEN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SHALL WE GO OUT FOR A ROW ON THE RIVER NOW THE TIDE WILL SUIT FOR US TO THE TOFTON WAY
2975-151995-0102 FOR IT WAS YEARS SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ON THE RIVER
2975-151995-0103 LUCY LINGERED TO GIVE AN ORDER TO THE SERVANT AND TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF TELLING STEPHEN THAT MAGGIE HAD NO OBJECTION TO SEEING PHILIP SO THAT IT WAS A PITY SHE HAD SENT THAT NOTE THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BUT SHE WOULD WRITE ANOTHER TO MORROW AND INVITE HIM
2975-151995-0104 I'LL CALL AND BEAT HIM UP TO MORROW SAID STEPHEN AND BRING HIM WITH ME IN THE EVENING SHALL I
2975-151995-0105 I MUST LEAVE THE FIELD CLEAR FOR THEM IN THE MORNING OH YES PRAY BRING HIM SAID LUCY AND YOU WILL LIKE MAGGIE SHA'N'T YOU SHE ADDED IN A BESEECHING TONE ISN'T SHE A DEAR NOBLE LOOKING CREATURE TOO TALL
2975-151995-0106 SAID STEPHEN SMILING DOWN UPON HER AND A LITTLE TOO FIERY
2975-151995-0107 GENTLEMEN YOU ARE AWARE ARE APT TO IMPART THESE IMPRUDENT CONFIDENCES TO LADIES CONCERNING THEIR UNFAVORABLE OPINION OF SISTER FAIR ONES THAT IS WHY SO MANY WOMEN
2975-151995-0108 HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWING THAT THEY ARE SECRETLY REPULSIVE TO MEN WHO HAVE SELF DENYINGLY MADE ARDENT LOVE TO THEM
2975-151995-0109 THAN THAT SHE BOTH IMPLICITLY BELIEVED WHAT STEPHEN SAID AND WAS DETERMINED THAT MAGGIE SHOULD NOT KNOW IT BUT YOU WHO HAVE A HIGHER LOGIC THAN THE VERBAL TO GUIDE YOU HAVE ALREADY FORESEEN AS THE DIRECT SEQUENCE TO THAT UNFAVORABLE OPINION OF STEPHEN'S
2975-151995-0110 THAT HE WALKED DOWN TO THE BOATHOUSE CALCULATING BY THE AID OF A VIVID IMAGINATION THAT MAGGIE MUST GIVE HIM HER HAND AT LEAST TWICE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PLEASANT BOATING PLAN AND THAT A GENTLEMAN WHO WISHES LADIES TO LOOK AT HIM
2975-151995-0111 IS ADVANTAGEOUSLY SITUATED WHEN HE IS ROWING THEM IN A BOAT WHAT THEN HAD HE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS SURPRISING DAUGHTER OF MISSUS TULLIVER AT FIRST SIGHT CERTAINLY NOT SUCH PASSIONS ARE NEVER HEARD OF IN REAL LIFE BESIDES
2975-151995-0112 HE WAS IN LOVE ALREADY AND HALF ENGAGED TO THE DEAREST LITTLE CREATURE IN THE WORLD AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF IN ANY WAY BUT WHEN ONE IS FIVE AND TWENTY ONE HAS NOT CHALK STONES AT ONE'S FINGER ENDS
2975-151995-0113 THAT THE TOUCH OF A HANDSOME GIRL SHOULD BE ENTIRELY INDIFFERENT IT WAS PERFECTLY NATURAL AND SAFE
2975-151995-0114 AND THERE WAS REALLY SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS GIRL WITH HER POVERTY AND TROUBLES IT WAS GRATIFYING TO SEE THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUSINS GENERALLY STEPHEN ADMITTED HE WAS NOT FOND OF WOMEN WHO HAD ANY PECULIARITY OF CHARACTER
2975-151995-0115 BUT HERE THE PECULIARITY SEEMED REALLY OF A SUPERIOR KIND AND PROVIDED ONE IS NOT OBLIGED TO MARRY SUCH WOMEN WHY THEY CERTAINLY MAKE A VARIETY IN SOCIAL INTERCOURSE MAGGIE DID NOT FULFIL STEPHEN'S HOPE
2975-151995-0116 BY LOOKING AT HIM DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF AN HOUR HER EYES WERE TOO FULL OF THE OLD BANKS THAT SHE KNEW SO WELL SHE FELT LONELY CUT OFF FROM PHILIP THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAD EVER SEEMED TO LOVE HER DEVOTEDLY
2975-151995-0117 BUT PRESENTLY THE RHYTHMIC MOVEMENT OF THE OARS ATTRACTED HER
2975-151995-0118 THIS ROUSED HER FROM HER REVERIE AND SHE ASKED IF SHE MIGHT TAKE AN OAR IT APPEARED THAT SHE REQUIRED MUCH TEACHING AND SHE BECAME AMBITIOUS THE EXERCISE BROUGHT THE WARM BLOOD INTO HER CHEEKS AND MADE HER INCLINED TO TAKE HER LESSON MERRILY
2975-151995-0119 I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED UNTIL I CAN MANAGE BOTH OARS AND ROW YOU AND LUCY SHE SAID LOOKING VERY BRIGHT AS SHE STEPPED OUT OF THE BOAT MAGGIE WE KNOW
2975-151995-0120 AND SHE HAD CHOSEN AN INOPPORTUNE MOMENT FOR HER REMARK HER FOOT SLIPPED BUT HAPPILY MISTER STEPHEN GUEST HELD HER HAND AND KEPT HER UP WITH A FIRM GRASP YOU HAVE NOT HURT YOURSELF AT ALL I HOPE HE SAID BENDING TO LOOK IN HER FACE WITH ANXIETY
2975-151995-0121 IT WAS VERY CHARMING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IN THAT KIND GRACEFUL MANNER BY SOME ONE TALLER AND STRONGER THAN ONE'S SELF MAGGIE HAD NEVER FELT JUST IN THE SAME WAY BEFORE
2975-151995-0122 WHEN THEY REACHED HOME AGAIN THEY FOUND UNCLE AND AUNT PULLET SEATED WITH MISSUS TULLIVER IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND STEPHEN HURRIED AWAY ASKING LEAVE TO COME AGAIN IN THE EVENING AND PRAY BRING WITH YOU THE VOLUME OF PURCELL THAT YOU TOOK AWAY SAID LUCY
2975-151995-0123 I WANT MAGGIE TO HEAR YOUR BEST SONGS AUNT PULLET UNDER THE CERTAINTY THAT MAGGIE WOULD BE INVITED TO GO OUT WITH LUCY PROBABLY TO PARK HOUSE WAS MUCH SHOCKED AT THE SHABBINESS OF HER CLOTHES WHICH WHEN WITNESSED BY THE HIGHER SOCIETY OF SAINT OGG'S
