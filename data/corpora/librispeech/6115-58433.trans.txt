6115-58433-0000 CHAPTER TEN THE ESCAPE TREADING SOFTLY AND WITH EARS STRAINING FOR THE SLIGHTEST SOUND THE TWO MEN DESCENDED TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE THEY HEARD NOTHING TO ALARM THEM AS THEY CREPT DOWN AND NOT UNTIL THEY PAUSED ON THE FIRST LANDING TO RECONNOITRE
6115-58433-0001 DID THEY EVEN CATCH THE MURMUR OF VOICES ISSUING FROM THE GUARDROOM BELOW SO MUFFLED WAS THE SOUND THAT CRISPIN GUESSED HOW MATTERS STOOD EVEN BEFORE HE HAD LOOKED OVER THE BALUSTERS INTO THE HALL BENEATH
6115-58433-0002 THE FAINT GREY OF THE DAWN WAS THE ONLY LIGHT THAT PENETRATED THE GLOOM OF THAT PIT THE FATES ARE KIND KENNETH HE WHISPERED THOSE FOOLS SIT WITH CLOSED DOORS COME BUT KENNETH LAID HIS HAND UPON GALLIARD'S SLEEVE
6115-58433-0003 WHAT IF THE DOOR SHOULD OPEN AS WE PASS SOMEONE WILL DIE MUTTERED CRISPIN BACK BUT PRAY GOD THAT IT MAY NOT WE MUST RUN THE RISK IS THERE NO OTHER WAY WHY YES RETURNED GALLIARD SARDONICALLY
6115-58433-0004 WE CAN LINGER HERE UNTIL WE ARE TAKEN BUT ODDSLIFE I'M NOT SO MINDED COME AND AS HE SPOKE HE DREW THE LAD ALONG HIS FOOT WAS UPON THE TOPMOST STAIR OF THE FLIGHT
6115-58433-0005 WHEN OF A SUDDEN THE STILLNESS OF THE HOUSE WAS BROKEN BY A LOUD KNOCK UPON THE STREET DOOR INSTANTLY AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN AWAITING IT THERE WAS A STIR OF FEET BELOW AND THE BANG OF AN OVERTURNED CHAIR THEN A SHAFT OF YELLOW LIGHT FELL ATHWART THE DARKNESS OF THE HALL
6115-58433-0006 THEY WERE BUT IN TIME
6115-58433-0007 A BOLT WAS DRAWN AND A CHAIN RATTLED THEN FOLLOWED THE CREAK OF HINGES
6115-58433-0008 CRISPIN COULD NOW MAKE OUT THE FIGURES OF COLONEL PRIDE AND OF THREE MEN WHO CAME WITH HIM BUT HE HAD SCANT LEISURE TO SURVEY THEM FOR THE COLONEL WAS IN HASTE COME SIRS HE HEARD HIM SAY LIGHT ME TO THEIR GARRET
6115-58433-0009 FOR AN INSTANT IT SEEMED TO HIM THERE WAS NAUGHT LEFT BUT TO STAND THERE AND AWAIT RECAPTURE THROUGH HIS MIND IT FLASHED THAT THEY WERE FIVE AND HE BUT ONE
6115-58433-0010 WITH THAT SWIFTNESS WHICH THOUGHT ALONE CAN COMPASS DID HE WEIGH THE ODDS AND JUDGE HIS CHANCES HE REALIZED HOW DESPERATE THEY WERE DID HE REMAIN AND EVEN AS HE THOUGHT HE GLANCED SHARPLY ROUND DIM INDEED WAS THE LIGHT
6115-58433-0011 BUT HIS SIGHT WAS KEEN AND QUICKENED BY THE IMMINENCE OF DANGER PARTLY HIS EYES AND PARTLY HIS INSTINCT TOLD HIM THAT NOT SIX PACES BEHIND HIM THERE MUST BE A DOOR AND IF HEAVEN PLEASED IT SHOULD BE UNLOCKED BEHIND IT THEY MUST LOOK FOR SHELTER
6115-58433-0012 IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND IN THAT SECOND OF CROWDING GALLOPING THOUGHT THAT PERCHANCE THE ROOM MIGHT BE OCCUPIED THAT WAS A RISK HE MUST TAKE THE LESSER RISK OF THE TWO THE CHOICE OF ONE OF WHICH WAS FORCED UPON HIM
6115-58433-0013 HE HAD DETERMINED ALL THIS ERE THE SOLDIER'S FOOT WAS UPON THE THIRD STEP OF THE STAIRCASE AND BEFORE THE COLONEL HAD COMMENCED THE ASCENT KENNETH STOOD PALSIED WITH FEAR GAZING LIKE ONE FASCINATED AT THE APPROACHING PERIL
6115-58433-0014 COME WITH ME AND TREAD LIGHTLY AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE IN THREE LONG STRIDES AND BY STEPS THAT WERE SOFTER THAN A CAT'S CRISPIN CROSSED TO THE DOOR WHICH HE HAD RATHER GUESSED THAN SEEN HE RAN HIS HAND ALONG UNTIL HE CAUGHT THE LATCH
6115-58433-0015 SOFTLY HE TRIED IT IT GAVE AND THE DOOR OPENED KENNETH WAS BY THEN BESIDE HIM HE PAUSED TO LOOK BACK ON THE OPPOSITE WALL THE LIGHT OF THE TROOPER'S LANTHORN FELL BRIGHTLY ANOTHER MOMENT AND THE FELLOW WOULD HAVE REACHED AND TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STAIRS
6115-58433-0016 AND HIS LIGHT MUST REVEAL THEM TO HIM BUT ERE THAT INSTANT WAS PASSED CRISPIN HAD DRAWN HIS COMPANION THROUGH
6115-58433-0017 THE CHAMBER WAS UNTENANTED AND ALMOST BARE OF FURNITURE AT WHICH DISCOVERY CRISPIN BREATHED MORE FREELY THEY STOOD THERE AND HEARD THE ASCENDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLANK CLANK OF A SWORD AGAINST THE STAIR RAIL A BAR OF YELLOW LIGHT CAME UNDER THE DOOR THAT SHELTERED THEM
6115-58433-0018 STRONGER IT GREW AND FARTHER IT CREPT ALONG THE FLOOR THEN STOPPED AND RECEDED AGAIN AS HE WHO BORE THE LANTHORN TURNED AND BEGAN TO CLIMB TO THE SECOND FLOOR AN INSTANT LATER AND THE LIGHT HAD VANISHED ECLIPSED BY THOSE WHO FOLLOWED IN THE FELLOW'S WAKE
6115-58433-0019 THE WINDOW SIR CRISPIN CRIED KENNETH IN AN EXCITED WHISPER THE WINDOW NO ANSWERED CRISPIN CALMLY THE DROP IS A LONG ONE AND WE SHOULD BUT LIGHT IN THE STREETS AND BE LITTLE BETTER THAN WE ARE HERE
6115-58433-0020 WAIT HE LISTENED THE FOOTSTEPS HAD TURNED THE CORNER LEADING TO THE FLOOR ABOVE HE OPENED THE DOOR PARTLY AT FIRST THEN WIDE FOR AN INSTANT HE STOOD LISTENING AGAIN THE STEPS WERE WELL OVERHEAD BY NOW
6115-58433-0021 SOON THEY WOULD MOUNT THE LAST FLIGHT AND THEN DISCOVERY MUST BE SWIFT TO FOLLOW NOW WAS ALL CRISPIN SAID AND DRAWING HIS SWORD HE LED THE WAY SWIFTLY YET CAUTIOUSLY TO THE STAIRS ONCE MORE IN PASSING HE GLANCED OVER THE RAILS THE GUARDROOM DOOR STOOD AJAR
6115-58433-0022 AND HE CAUGHT THE MURMURS OF SUBDUED CONVERSATION BUT HE DID NOT PAUSE HAD THE DOOR STOOD WIDE HE WOULD NOT HAVE PAUSED THEN THERE WAS NOT A SECOND TO BE LOST TO WAIT WAS TO INCREASE THE ALREADY OVERWHELMING DANGER CAUTIOUSLY
6115-58433-0023 AND LEANING WELL UPON THE STOUT BALUSTER HE BEGAN THE DESCENT KENNETH FOLLOWED HIM MECHANICALLY WITH WHITE FACE AND A FEELING OF SUFFOCATION IN HIS THROAT THEY GAINED THE CORNER AND TURNING THEY BEGAN WHAT WAS TRULY THE PERILOUS PART OF THEIR JOURNEY
6115-58433-0024 NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN STEPS WERE THERE BUT AT THE BOTTOM STOOD THE GUARDROOM DOOR AND THROUGH THE CHINK OF ITS OPENING A SHAFT OF LIGHT FELL UPON THE NETHERMOST STEP ONCE A STAIR CREAKED AND TO THEIR QUICKENED SENSES IT SOUNDED LIKE A PISTOL SHOT
6115-58433-0025 AS LOUD TO CRISPIN SOUNDED THE INDRAWN BREATH OF APPREHENSION FROM KENNETH THAT FOLLOWED IT HE HAD ALMOST PAUSED TO CURSE THE LAD WHEN THINKING HIM OF HOW TIME PRESSED HE WENT ON WITHIN THREE STEPS OF THE BOTTOM WERE THEY
6115-58433-0026 AND THEY COULD ALMOST DISTINGUISH WHAT WAS BEING SAID IN THE ROOM WHEN CRISPIN STOPPED AND TURNING HIS HEAD TO ATTRACT KENNETH'S ATTENTION HE POINTED STRAIGHT ACROSS THE HALL TO A DIMLY VISIBLE DOOR IT WAS THAT OF THE CHAMBER WHEREIN HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE CROMWELL
6115-58433-0027 ITS POSITION HAD OCCURRED TO HIM SOME MOMENTS BEFORE AND HE HAD DETERMINED THEN UPON GOING THAT WAY THE LAD FOLLOWED THE INDICATION OF HIS FINGER
6115-58433-0028 BUT THE CALM UNMOVABLE CRISPIN PROCEEDED AS IF NAUGHT HAD CHANCED HE ARGUED THAT EVEN IF HE WHO HAD RISEN WERE COMING TOWARDS THE DOOR THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY STANDING STILL THEIR ONLY CHANCE LAY NOW IN PASSING BEFORE IT MIGHT BE OPENED
6115-58433-0029 THEY THAT WALK THROUGH PERILS IN A BRAVE MAN'S COMPANY CANNOT BUT GAIN CONFIDENCE FROM THE CALM OF HIS DEMEANOUR SO WAS IT NOW WITH KENNETH
6115-58433-0030 AND WELL IT WAS FOR HIM THAT THIS WAS SO THEY GAINED THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AT LENGTH
6115-58433-0031 THEN SLOWLY PAINFULLY SLOWLY TO AVOID THEIR STEPS FROM RINGING UPON THE STONE FLOOR THEY CREPT ACROSS TOWARDS THE DOOR THAT MEANT SAFETY TO SIR CRISPIN SLOWLY STEP BY STEP THEY MOVED AND WITH EVERY STRIDE CRISPIN LOOKED BEHIND HIM
6115-58433-0032 IN SILENCE AND IN SAFETY THEY WERE PERMITTED TO REACH THE DOOR TO CRISPIN'S JOY IT WAS UNFASTENED QUIETLY HE OPENED IT
6115-58433-0033 HOLDING IT FOR HIM AS HE PASSED IN AND KEEPING WATCH WITH EYE AND EAR THE WHILE SCARCE HAD KENNETH ENTERED THE CHAMBER WHEN FROM ABOVE CAME THE SOUND OF LOUD AND EXCITED VOICES ANNOUNCING TO THEM THAT THEIR FLIGHT WAS AT LAST DISCOVERED
6115-58433-0034 WITH CONFUSED SHOUTS THAT SOMETHING MUST BE AMISS
6115-58433-0035 SLIFE HE MUTTERED TWAS A CLOSE THING AYE SHOUT YOU CUCKOLDS HE WENT ON YELL YOURSELVES HOARSE AS THE CROWS YOU ARE YOU'LL HANG US WHERE GIVES ARE HANGED WILL YOU KENNETH TUGGED AT THE SKIRTS OF HIS DOUBLET WHAT NOW HE INQUIRED
6115-58433-0036 NOW SAID CRISPIN WE'LL LEAVE BY THE WINDOW IF IT PLEASE YOU THEY CROSSED THE ROOM AND A MOMENT OR TWO LATER THEY HAD DROPPED ON TO THE NARROW RAILED PATHWAY OVERLOOKING THE RIVER WHICH CRISPIN HAD OBSERVED FROM THEIR PRISON WINDOW THE EVENING BEFORE
6115-58433-0037 HE HAD OBSERVED TOO THAT A SMALL BOAT WAS MOORED AT SOME STEPS ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FARTHER DOWN THE STREAM AND TOWARDS THAT SPOT HE NOW SPED ALONG THE FOOTPATH FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY KENNETH THE PATH SLOPED IN THAT DIRECTION SO THAT BY THE TIME THE SPOT WAS REACHED THE WATER FLOWED NOT MORE THAN SIX FEET OR SO BENEATH THEM
6115-58433-0038 HALF A DOZEN STEPS TOOK THEM DOWN THIS TO THE MOORINGS OF THAT BOAT WHICH FORTUNATELY HAD NOT BEEN REMOVED GET IN KENNETH CRISPIN COMMANDED THERE
6115-58433-0039 HEAVEN SEND WE COME UPON SOME GOOD MALIGNANT HOMESTEAD ERE WE GO FAR
