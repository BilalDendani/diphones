5724-13364-0000 I THINK THIS HAS BEEN THE VERY DREARIEST WINTER I EVER KNEW HAS IT NOT MY LITTLE DAUGHTER WHO BROUGHT HER THESE VIOLETS
5724-13364-0001 WHERE SOMEHOW OR OTHER MURIEL ALWAYS LAY CURLED UP AT TEA TIME NOW AY AND MANY HOURS IN THE DAY TIME THOUGH WE HARDLY NOTICED IT AT FIRST TAKING BETWEEN HIS HANDS THE LITTLE FACE WHICH BROKE INTO SMILES AT THE MEREST TOUCH OF THE FATHER'S FINGERS HE ASKED HER
5724-13364-0002 TO MORROW SO WE HAVE SAID FOR A GREAT MANY TO MORROWS BUT IT IS ALWAYS PUT OFF WHAT DO YOU THINK MOTHER IS THE LITTLE MAID STRONG ENOUGH MISSUS HALIFAX HESITATED SAID SOMETHING ABOUT EAST WINDS
5724-13364-0003 YET I THINK IT WOULD DO HER GOOD IF SHE BRAVED EAST WINDS AND PLAYED OUT OF DOORS AS THE BOYS DO
5724-13364-0004 THE CHILD SHRANK BACK WITH AN INVOLUNTARY OH NO THAT IS BECAUSE SHE IS A LITTLE GIRL NECESSARILY LESS STRONG THAN THE LADS ARE IS IT NOT SO UNCLE PHINEAS CONTINUED HER FATHER HASTILY
5724-13364-0005 MURIEL WILL BE QUITE STRONG WHEN THE WARM WEATHER COMES WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SEVERE WINTER EVERY ONE OF THE CHILDREN HAS SUFFERED SAID THE MOTHER IN A CHEERFUL TONE AS SHE POURED OUT A CUP OF CREAM FOR HER DAUGHTER
5724-13364-0006 TO WHOM WAS NOW GIVEN BY COMMON CONSENT ALL THE RICHEST AND RAREST OF THE HOUSE I THINK EVERY ONE HAS SAID JOHN LOOKING ROUND ON HIS APPLE CHEEKED BOYS IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SHARP EYE THAT DETECTED ANY DECREASE OF HEALTH
5724-13364-0007 OR INCREASE OF SUFFERING THERE BUT MY PLAN WILL SET ALL TO RIGHTS I SPOKE TO MISSUS TOD YESTERDAY SHE WILL BE READY TO TAKE US ALL IN BOYS SHALL YOU LIKE GOING TO ENDERLEY YOU SHALL GO AS SOON AS EVER THE LARCH WOOD IS GREEN
5724-13364-0008 FOR AT LONGFIELD ALREADY WE BEGAN TO MAKE A NATURAL ALMANACK AND CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE
5724-13364-0009 I THINK SO UNLESS YOU WILL CONSENT TO LET ME GO ALONE TO ENDERLEY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WHAT WITH THOSE TROUBLES AT THE MILLS HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO LIGHTLY
5724-13364-0010 ONLY CHEERFULLY THE TROUBLES MUST BE BORNE WHY NOT BEAR THEM WITH AS GOOD HEART AS POSSIBLE THEY CANNOT LAST LET LORD LUXMORE DO WHAT HE WILL IF AS I TOLD YOU WE RE LET LONGFIELD FOR THIS ONE SUMMER TO SIR RALPH
5724-13364-0011 IF MY LANDLORD WILL NOT DO IT I WILL AND ADD A STEAM ENGINE TOO NOW THE LAST WAS A DARING SCHEME DISCUSSED MANY A WINTER NIGHT BY US THREE IN LONGFIELD PARLOUR
5724-13364-0012 AT FIRST MISSUS HALIFAX HAD LOOKED GRAVE MOST WOMEN WOULD ESPECIALLY WIVES AND MOTHERS IN THOSE DAYS WHEN EVERY INNOVATION WAS REGARDED WITH HORROR AND IMPROVEMENT AND RUIN WERE HELD SYNONYMOUS
5724-13364-0013 SHE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT SO TOO HAD SHE NOT BELIEVED IN HER HUSBAND BUT NOW AT MENTION OF THE STEAM ENGINE SHE LOOKED UP AND SMILED LADY OLDTOWER ASKED ME ABOUT IT TO DAY SHE SAID SHE HOPED YOU WOULD NOT RUIN YOURSELF
5724-13364-0014 LIKE MISTER MILLER OF GLASGOW I SAID I WAS NOT AFRAID HER HUSBAND RETURNED A BRIGHT LOOK IT IS EASIER TO MAKE THE WORLD TRUST ONE WHEN ONE IS TRUSTED BY ONE'S OWN HOUSEHOLD AH
5724-13364-0015 NEVER FEAR YOU WILL MAKE YOUR FORTUNE YET IN SPITE OF LORD LUXMORE FOR ALL WINTER JOHN HAD FOUND OUT HOW MANY CARES COME WITH AN ATTAINED WISH CHIEFLY BECAUSE AS THE EARL HAD SAID
5724-13364-0016 HIS LORDSHIP POSSESSED AN EXCELLENT MEMORY THE KINGSWELL ELECTION HAD WORKED ITS RESULTS IN A HUNDRED SMALL WAYS WHEREIN THE HEAVY HAND OF THE LANDLORD COULD BE LAID UPON THE TENANT HE BORE UP BRAVELY AGAINST IT
5724-13364-0017 BUT HARD WAS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN MIGHT AND RIGHT OPPRESSION AND STAUNCH RESISTANCE IT WOULD HAVE GONE HARDER BUT FOR ONE WHOM JOHN NOW BEGAN TO CALL HIS FRIEND AT LEAST ONE WHO INVARIABLY CALLED MISTER HALIFAX SO
5724-13364-0018 OUR NEIGHBOUR SIR RALPH OLDTOWER HOW OFTEN HAS LADY OLDTOWER BEEN HERE URSULA SHE CALLED FIRST YOU REMEMBER AFTER OUR TROUBLE WITH THE CHILDREN SHE HAS BEEN TWICE SINCE I THINK
5724-13364-0019 TO DAY SHE WANTED ME TO BRING MURIEL AND TAKE LUNCHEON AT THE MANOR HOUSE I SHALL NOT GO I TOLD HER SO BUT GENTLY I HOPE
5724-13364-0020 WELL NEVER MIND SOME DAY WE WILL TAKE OUR PLACE AND SO SHALL OUR CHILDREN
5724-13364-0021 I THINK THOUGH JOHN RARELY BETRAYED IT HE HAD STRONGLY THIS PRESENTIMENT OF FUTURE POWER WHICH MAY OFTEN BE NOTICED IN MEN WHO HAVE CARVED OUT THEIR OWN FORTUNES THEY HAVE IN THEM THE INSTINCT TO RISE
5724-13364-0022 AND AS SURELY AS WATER REGAINS ITS OWN LEVEL SO DO THEY FROM HOWEVER LOW A SOURCE ASCEND TO THEIRS NOT MANY WEEKS AFTER WE REMOVED IN A BODY TO ENDERLEY THOUGH THE CHIEF REASON WAS
5724-13364-0023 THAT JOHN MIGHT BE CONSTANTLY ON THE SPOT SUPERINTENDING HIS MILLS YET I FANCIED I COULD DETECT A SECONDARY REASON WHICH HE WOULD NOT OWN EVEN TO HIMSELF BUT WHICH PEERED OUT UNCONSCIOUSLY IN HIS ANXIOUS LOOKS
5724-13364-0024 I SAW IT WHEN HE TRIED TO ROUSE MURIEL INTO ENERGY BY TELLING HER HOW MUCH SHE WOULD ENJOY ENDERLEY HILL
5724-13364-0025 SEEMED TO BE TO MAKE HER LOVE THE WORLD AND THE THINGS THEREIN HE USED TO TURN AWAY ALMOST IN PAIN FROM HER SMILE AS SHE WOULD LISTEN TO ALL HE SAID THEN STEAL OFF TO THE HARPSICHORD AND BEGIN THAT SOFT DREAMY MUSIC
5724-13364-0026 WHICH THE CHILDREN CALLED TALKING TO ANGELS WE CAME TO ENDERLEY THROUGH THE VALLEY WHERE WAS JOHN'S CLOTH MILL MANY A TIME IN OUR WALKS HE AND I HAD PASSED IT AND STOPPED TO LISTEN TO THE DROWSY FALL OF THE MINIATURE NIAGARA
5724-13364-0027 TURNING OF THE GREAT WATER WHEEL LITTLE WE THOUGHT HE SHOULD EVER OWN IT OR THAT JOHN WOULD BE POINTING IT OUT TO HIS OWN BOYS LECTURING THEM ON UNDERSHOT AND OVERSHOT AS HE USED TO LECTURE ME IT WAS SWEET
5724-13364-0028 THOUGH HALF MELANCHOLY TO SEE ENDERLEY AGAIN TO CLIMB THE STEEP MEADOWS AND NARROW MULE PATHS UP WHICH HE USED TO HELP ME SO KINDLY HE COULD NOT NOW HE HAD HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER IN HIS ARMS IT HAD COME ALAS
5724-13364-0029 TO BE A REGULAR THING THAT MURIEL SHOULD BE CARRIED UP EVERY SLIGHT ASCENT
5724-13364-0030 WE PAUSED HALF WAY UP ON A LOW WALL WHERE I HAD MANY A TIME RESTED WATCHING THE SUNSET OVER NUNNELEY HILL WATCHING FOR JOHN TO COME HOME EVERY NIGHT AT LEAST AFTER MISS MARCH WENT AWAY
5724-13364-0031 HE USUALLY FOUND ME SITTING THERE HE TURNED TO ME AND SMILED DOST REMEMBER LAD AT WHICH APPELLATION GUY WIDELY STARED BUT FOR A MINUTE HOW STRANGELY IT BROUGHT BACK OLD TIMES
5724-13364-0032 WHEN THERE WERE NEITHER WIFE NOR CHILDREN ONLY HE AND I THIS SEAT ON THE WALL WITH ITS SMALL TWILIGHT PICTURE OF THE VALLEY BELOW THE MILL AND NUNNELEY HEIGHTS
5724-13364-0033 WAS ALL MINE MINE SOLELY FOR EVERMORE ENDERLEY IS JUST THE SAME PHINEAS TWELVE YEARS HAVE MADE NO CHANGE EXCEPT IN US AND HE LOOKED FONDLY AT HIS WIFE WHO STOOD A LITTLE WAY OFF
5724-13364-0034 HOLDING FIRMLY ON THE WALL IN A HAZARDOUS GROUP HER THREE BOYS
5724-13364-0035 IN TWO BRIEF PHRASES GIVEN BY OUR FRIEND SHAKSPEARE ONE TO HAMLET THE OTHER TO OTHELLO TIS VERY STRANGE AND TIS BETTER AS IT IS
5724-13364-0036 BETTER AS IT WAS BETTER A THOUSAND TIMES I WENT TO MISSUS HALIFAX AND HELPED HER TO DESCRIBE THE PROSPECT TO THE INQUISITIVE BOYS FINALLY COAXING THE REFRACTORY GUY UP THE WINDING ROAD WHERE
5724-13364-0037 JUST AS IF IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY STOOD MY OLD FRIENDS MY FOUR LOMBARDY POPLARS THREE TOGETHER AND ONE APART MISSUS TOD DESCRIED US AFAR OFF
5724-13364-0038 A LITTLE STOUTER A LITTLE ROSIER THAT WAS ALL IN HER DELIGHT SHE SO ABSOLUTELY FORGOT HERSELF AS TO ADDRESS THE MOTHER AS MISS MARCH AT WHICH LONG UNSPOKEN NAME URSULA STARTED
5724-13364-0039 HER COLOUR WENT AND CAME AND HER EYES TURNED RESTLESSLY TOWARDS THE CHURCH HARD BY IT IS ALL RIGHT MISS MA'AM I MEAN TOD BEARS IN MIND MISTER HALIFAX'S ORDERS AND HAS PLANTED
5724-13364-0040 ROOTS AND EVERGREENS YES I KNOW AND WHEN SHE HAD PUT ALL HER LITTLE ONES TO BED WE WONDERING WHERE THE MOTHER WAS WENT OUT TOWARDS THE LITTLE CHURCHYARD AND FOUND HER QUIETLY SITTING THERE
5724-13364-0041 MURIEL BRIGHTENED UP BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN THERE MANY DAYS
5724-13364-0042 AND GO ABOUT WITH ME EVERYWHERE IT WAS THE SEASON SHE ENJOYED MOST THE TIME OF THE SINGING OF BIRDS AND THE SPRINGING OF DELICATE SCENTED FLOWERS I MYSELF NEVER LOVED THE BEECH WOOD BETTER THAN DID OUR MURIEL
5724-13364-0043 SHE USED CONTINUALLY TO TELL US THIS WAS THE HAPPIEST SPRING SHE HAD EVER HAD IN HER LIFE JOHN WAS MUCH OCCUPIED NOW HE LEFT HIS NORTON BURY BUSINESS UNDER EFFICIENT CARE
5724-13364-0044 EARLY AND LATE HE WAS THERE VERY OFTEN MURIEL AND I FOLLOWED HIM AND SPENT WHOLE MORNINGS IN THE MILL MEADOWS THROUGH THEM THE STREAM ON WHICH THE MACHINERY DEPENDED WAS LED BY VARIOUS CONTRIVANCES
5724-13364-0045 CHECKED OR INCREASED IN ITS FLOW MAKING SMALL PONDS OR LOCKS OR WATERFALLS WE USED TO STAY FOR HOURS LISTENING TO ITS MURMUR TO THE SHARP STRANGE CRY OF THE SWANS THAT WERE KEPT THERE
5724-13364-0046 AND THE TWITTER OF THE WATER HEN TO HER YOUNG AMONG THE REEDS THEN THE FATHER WOULD COME TO US AND REMAIN A FEW MINUTES FONDLING MURIEL AND TELLING ME HOW THINGS WENT ON AT THE MILL ONE MORNING AS WE THREE SAT THERE
5724-13364-0047 ON THE BRICK WORK OF A LITTLE BRIDGE UNDERNEATH AN ELM TREE ROUND THE ROOTS OF WHICH THE WATER MADE A POOL SO CLEAR THAT WE COULD SEE A LARGE PIKE
5724-13364-0048 HALF WAY DOWN JOHN SUDDENLY SAID WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE STREAM DO YOU NOTICE PHINEAS
5724-13364-0049 THESE TWO HOURS I THOUGHT YOU WERE DRAWING OFF THE WATER
5724-13364-0050 AND ISN'T THIS A SWEET SUNNY PLACE FOR A LITTLE MAID TO BE LAZY IN HIS TONE WAS GAY BUT HE HAD AN ANXIOUS LOOK HE WALKED RAPIDLY DOWN THE MEADOWS AND WENT INTO HIS MILL THEN I SAW HIM RETRACING HIS STEPS
5724-13364-0051 EXAMINING WHERE THE STREAM ENTERED THE BOUNDS OF HIS PROPERTY FINALLY HE WALKED OFF TOWARDS THE LITTLE TOWN AT THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY BEYOND WHICH BURIED IN WOODS LAY LUXMORE HALL
5724-13364-0052 THEN HE CAME TOWARDS US NARROWLY WATCHING THE STREAM IT HAD SUNK MORE AND MORE THE MUDDY BOTTOM WAS SHOWING PLAINLY YES THAT'S IT IT CAN BE NOTHING ELSE I DID NOT THINK HE WOULD HAVE DARED TO DO IT
5724-13364-0053 DO WHAT JOHN WHO LORD LUXMORE HE SPOKE IN THE SMOTHERED TONES OF VIOLENT PASSION LORD LUXMORE HAS TURNED OUT OF ITS COURSE THE STREAM THAT WORKS MY MILL
5724-13364-0054 I TRIED TO URGE THAT SUCH AN ACT WAS IMPROBABLE IN FACT AGAINST THE LAW NOT AGAINST THE LAW OF THE GREAT AGAINST THE LITTLE BESIDES HE GIVES A DECENT COLOURING
5724-13364-0055 TO MAKE FOUNTAINS AT LUXMORE HALL BUT I SEE WHAT IT IS I HAVE SEEN IT COMING A WHOLE YEAR HE IS DETERMINED TO RUIN ME JOHN SAID THIS IN MUCH EXCITEMENT
5724-13364-0056 HE HARDLY FELT MURIEL'S TINY CREEPING HANDS WHAT DOES RUIN MEAN IS ANYBODY MAKING FATHER ANGRY NO MY SWEET NOT ANGRY ONLY VERY VERY MISERABLE HE SNATCHED HER UP AND BURIED HIS HEAD IN HER SOFT CHILDISH BOSOM
5724-13364-0057 SHE KISSED HIM AND PATTED HIS HAIR NEVER MIND DEAR FATHER YOU SAY NOTHING SIGNIFIES IF WE ARE ONLY GOOD AND FATHER IS ALWAYS GOOD I WISH I WERE HE SAT DOWN WITH HER ON HIS KNEE
5724-13364-0058 THE MURMUR OF THE ELM LEAVES AND THE SLOW DROPPING OF THE STREAM SOOTHED HIM BY AND BY HIS SPIRIT ROSE AS IT ALWAYS DID THE HEAVIER IT WAS PRESSED DOWN NO LORD LUXMORE SHALL NOT RUIN ME I HAVE THOUGHT OF A SCHEME
5724-13364-0059 BUT FIRST I MUST SPEAK TO MY PEOPLE I SHALL HAVE TO SHORTEN WAGES FOR A TIME HOW SOON TO NIGHT IF IT MUST BE DONE BETTER DONE AT ONCE BEFORE WINTER SETS IN POOR FELLOWS
5724-13364-0060 THEY'LL BE HARD UPON ME BUT IT IS ONLY TEMPORARY I MUST REASON THEM INTO PATIENCE IF I CAN GOD KNOWS IT IS NOT THEY ALONE WHO WANT IT
5724-13364-0061 HE ALMOST GROUND HIS TEETH AS HE SAW THE SUN SHINING ON THE FAR WHITE WING OF LUXMORE HALL HAVE YOU NO WAY OF RIGHTING YOURSELF IF IT IS AN UNLAWFUL ACT WHY NOT GO TO LAW PHINEAS YOU FORGET MY PRINCIPLE
5724-13364-0062 I URGED NO MORE SINCE WHETHER ABSTRACTEDLY THE QUESTION BE RIGHT OR WRONG THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT WHAT A MAN BELIEVES TO BE EVIL TO HIM IT IS EVIL NOW UNCLE PHINEAS GO YOU HOME WITH MURIEL
5724-13364-0063 TELL MY WIFE WHAT HAS OCCURRED SAY I WILL COME TO TEA AS SOON AS I CAN BUT I MAY HAVE SOME LITTLE TROUBLE WITH MY PEOPLE HERE SHE MUST NOT ALARM HERSELF NO THE MOTHER NEVER DID
5724-13364-0064 SHE HAD THE RARE FEMININE VIRTUE OF NEVER FIDGETTING AT LEAST EXTERNALLY WHAT WAS TO BE BORNE SHE BORE WHAT WAS TO BE DONE SHE DID BUT SHE RARELY MADE ANY FUSS ABOUT EITHER HER DOINGS
5724-13364-0065 OR HER SUFFERINGS TO NIGHT
5724-13364-0066 UNDERSTOOD IT I THINK MORE CLEARLY THAN I DID PROBABLY FROM BEING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER HUSBAND'S PLANS AND FEARS SHE SAW AT ONCE THE POSITION IN WHICH HE WAS PLACED A GRAVE ONE
5724-13364-0067 THEN YOU THINK JOHN IS RIGHT OF COURSE I DO I HAD NOT MEANT IT AS A QUESTION OR EVEN A DOUBT BUT IT WAS PLEASANT TO HEAR HER THUS ANSWER FOR AS I HAVE SAID URSULA WAS NOT A WOMAN TO BE LED BLINDFOLD
5724-13364-0068 WAS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE HERSELF THAN JOHN SHE SAID NO MORE BUT PUT THE CHILDREN TO BED THEN CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH HER BONNET ON WILL YOU COME WITH ME PHINEAS OR ARE YOU TOO TIRED I AM GOING DOWN TO THE MILL SHE STARTED WALKING QUICKLY
5724-13364-0069 SHE STOOPED TO PICK UP A CRYING CHILD AND SEND IT HOME TO ITS MOTHER IN ENDERLEY VILLAGE IT WAS ALMOST DARK AND WE MET NO ONE ELSE EXCEPT A YOUNG MAN
5724-13364-0070 HE WAS RATHER ODD LOOKING BEING INVARIABLY MUFFLED UP IN A LARGE CLOAK AND A FOREIGN SORT OF HAT WHO IS THAT WATCHING OUR MILLS SAID MISSUS HALIFAX HASTILY I TOLD HER ALL I HAD SEEN OF THE PERSON A PAPIST MOST LIKELY
5724-13364-0071 JOHN OBJECTED TO THE OPPROBRIOUS WORD PAPIST
5724-13364-0072 THEY USED TO FIND SHELTER AT LUXMORE AND THAT NAME SET BOTH OUR THOUGHTS ANXIOUSLY WANDERING SO THAT NOT UNTIL WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL DID I NOTICE THAT THE PERSON HAD FOLLOWED US ALMOST TO THE MILL GATES IN HIS EMPTY MILL
5724-13364-0073 STANDING BESIDE ONE OF ITS SILENCED LOOMS WE FOUND THE MASTER HE WAS VERY MUCH DEJECTED URSULA TOUCHED HIS ARM BEFORE HE EVEN SAW HER WELL LOVE YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED YES JOHN BUT NEVER MIND
5724-13364-0074 I WOULD NOT EXCEPT FOR MY POOR PEOPLE WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING THAT WHICH YOU HAVE WISHED TO DO ALL THE YEAR OUR WISHES COME AS A CROSS TO US SOMETIMES HE SAID RATHER BITTERLY IT IS THE ONLY THING I CAN DO
5724-13364-0075 THE WATER POWER BEING SO GREATLY LESSENED I MUST EITHER STOP THE MILLS OR WORK THEM BY STEAM DO THAT THEN SET UP YOUR STEAM ENGINE AND HAVE ALL THE COUNTRY DOWN UPON ME FOR DESTROYING HAND LABOUR HAVE A NEW SET OF LUDDITES COMING TO BURN MY MILL
5724-13364-0076 AND BREAK MY MACHINERY THAT IS WHAT LORD LUXMORE WANTS DID HE NOT SAY HE WOULD RUIN ME WORSE THAN THIS HE IS RUINING MY GOOD NAME IF YOU HAD HEARD THOSE POOR PEOPLE WHOM I SENT AWAY TONIGHT
5724-13364-0077 WHO WILL HAVE SHORT WORK THESE TWO MONTHS AND AFTER THAT MACHINERY WORK WHICH THEY FANCY IS TAKING THE VERY BREAD OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS
5724-13364-0078 HE SPOKE AS WE RARELY HEARD JOHN SPEAK AS WORLDLY CARES AND WORLDLY INJUSTICE CAUSE EVEN THE BEST OF MEN TO SPEAK SOMETIMES POOR PEOPLE HE ADDED HOW CAN I BLAME THEM I WAS ACTUALLY DUMB BEFORE THEM TO NIGHT
5724-13364-0079 WHEN THEY SAID I MUST TAKE THE COST OF WHAT I DO THEY MUST HAVE BREAD FOR THEIR CHILDREN BUT SO MUST I FOR MINE LORD LUXMORE IS THE CAUSE OF ALL HERE I HEARD OR FANCIED I HEARD OUT OF THE BLACK SHADOW BEHIND THE LOOM A HEAVY SIGH
5724-13364-0080 YOU AND THE CHILDREN ARE SECURE ANYHOW THAT'S ONE COMFORT BUT OH MY POOR PEOPLE AT ENDERLEY AGAIN URSULA ASKED IF NOTHING COULD BE DONE YES I DID THINK OF ONE PLAN BUT JOHN I KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF
5724-13364-0081 SHE LAID HER HAND ON HIS ARM AND LOOKED STRAIGHT UP AT HIM EYE TO EYE
5724-13364-0082 CLEARLY AS A BOOK AT LAST JOHN SAID WOULD IT BE TOO HARD A SACRIFICE LOVE HOW CAN YOU TALK SO WE COULD DO IT EASILY BY LIVING IN A PLAINER WAY BY GIVING UP ONE OR TWO TRIFLES ONLY OUTSIDE THINGS YOU KNOW
5724-13364-0083 WHY NEED WE CARE FOR OUTSIDE THINGS WHY INDEED HE SAID IN A LOW FOND TONE SO I EASILY FOUND OUT HOW THEY MEANT TO SETTLE THE DIFFICULTY NAMELY
5724-13364-0084 LEST HIS FAMILY SHOULD TAKE HARM BY ANY POSSIBLE NON SUCCESS IN HIS BUSINESS HAD SETTLED UPON HIS WIFE THREE MONTHS OF LITTLE RENUNCIATIONS THREE MONTHS OF THE OLD NARROW WAY OF LIVING AS AT NORTON BURY
5724-13364-0085 AND THE POOR PEOPLE AT ENDERLEY MIGHT HAVE FULL WAGES WHETHER OR NO THERE WAS FULL WORK THEN IN OUR QUIET VALLEY THERE WOULD BE NO WANT NO MURMURINGS AND ABOVE ALL NO BLAMING OF THE MASTER THEY DECIDED IT ALL
5724-13364-0086 IN FEWER WORDS THAN I HAVE TAKEN TO WRITE IT IT WAS SO EASY TO DECIDE WHEN BOTH WERE OF ONE MIND NOW SAID JOHN RISING AS IF A LOAD WERE TAKEN OFF HIS BREAST NOW
5724-13364-0087 HUSBAND DON'T LET US SPEAK OF LORD LUXMORE AGAIN THAT SIGH QUITE GHOSTLY IN THE DARKNESS THEY HEARD IT LIKEWISE THIS TIME WHO'S THERE ONLY I MISTER HALIFAX DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME
5724-13364-0088 IT WAS THE SOFTEST MILDEST VOICE THE VOICE OF ONE LONG USED TO OPPRESSION
5724-13364-0089 APPEARED FROM BEHIND THE LOOM I DO NOT KNOW YOU SIR HOW CAME YOU TO ENTER MY MILL I FOLLOWED MISSUS HALIFAX I HAVE OFTEN WATCHED HER AND YOUR CHILDREN BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME YES
5724-13364-0090 WE ALL RECOGNIZED THE FACE MORE WAN THAN EVER
5724-13364-0091 I AM SURPRISED TO SEE YOU HERE LORD RAVENEL HUSH I HATE THE VERY SOUND OF THE NAME I WOULD HAVE RENOUNCED IT LONG AGO
5724-13364-0092 IF HE WOULD HAVE LET ME HE DO YOU MEAN YOUR FATHER THE BOY NO HE WAS A YOUNG MAN NOW BUT SCARCELY LOOKED MORE THAN A BOY ASSENTED SILENTLY AS IF AFRAID TO UTTER THE NAME WOULD NOT YOUR COMING HERE DISPLEASE HIM SAID JOHN
5724-13364-0093 ALWAYS TENACIOUS OF TRENCHING A HAIR'S BREADTH UPON ANY LAWFUL AUTHORITY IT MATTERS NOT HE IS AWAY HE HAS LEFT ME THESE SIX MONTHS ALONE AT LUXMORE HAVE YOU OFFENDED HIM ASKED URSULA
5724-13364-0094 WHO HAD CAST KINDLY LOOKS ON THE THIN FACE WHICH PERHAPS REMINDED HER OF ANOTHER NOW FOR EVER BANISHED FROM OUR SIGHT AND HIS ALSO
5724-13364-0095 AND WISH TO BECOME A MONK THE YOUTH CROSSED HIMSELF THEN STARTED AND LOOKED ROUND IN TERROR OF OBSERVERS YOU WILL NOT BETRAY ME YOU ARE A GOOD MAN MISTER HALIFAX AND YOU SPOKE WARMLY FOR US TELL ME I WILL KEEP YOUR SECRET
5724-13364-0096 ARE YOU A CATHOLIC TOO NO INDEED AH I HOPED YOU WERE BUT YOU ARE SURE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY ME MISTER HALIFAX SMILED AT SUCH A POSSIBILITY YET IN TRUTH THERE WAS SOME REASON FOR THE YOUNG MAN'S FEARS
5724-13364-0097 SINCE EVEN IN THOSE DAYS CATHOLICS WERE HUNTED DOWN BOTH BY LAW AND BY PUBLIC OPINION AS VIRULENTLY AS PROTESTANT NONCONFORMISTS ALL WHO KEPT OUT OF THE PALE OF THE NATIONAL CHURCH WERE DENOUNCED AS
5724-13364-0098 SCHISMATICS DEISTS ATHEISTS IT WAS ALL ONE BUT WHY DO YOU WISH TO LEAVE THE WORLD I AM SICK OF IT THERE NEVER WAS BUT ONE IN IT I CARED FOR OR WHO CARED FOR ME AND NOW SANCTA MARIA ORA PRO NOBIS
5724-13364-0099 HIS LIPS MOVED IN A PAROXYSM OF PRAYER HELPLESS PARROT LEARNT LATIN PRAYER YET BEING IN EARNEST IT SEEMED TO DO HIM GOOD THE MOTHER AS IF SHE HEARD IN FANCY THAT PITIFUL CRY WHICH ROSE TO MY MEMORY TOO
5724-13364-0100 POOR WILLIAM DON'T TELL WILLIAM TURNED AND SPOKE TO HIM KINDLY ASKING HIM IF HE WOULD GO HOME WITH US HE LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY SURPRISED I YOU CANNOT MEAN IT AFTER LORD LUXMORE HAS DONE YOU ALL THIS EVIL
5724-13364-0101 IS THAT ANY REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT DO GOOD TO HIS SON THAT IS IF I COULD CAN I THE LAD LIFTED UP THOSE SOFT GREY EYES AND THEN I REMEMBERED WHAT HIS SISTER HAD SAID OF LORD RAVENEL'S ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION OF MISTER HALIFAX
5724-13364-0102 OH YOU COULD YOU COULD BUT I AND MINE ARE HERETICS YOU KNOW I WILL PRAY FOR YOU ONLY LET ME COME AND SEE YOU
5724-13364-0103 COME AND WELCOME HEARTILY WELCOME LORD NO NOT THAT NAME MISSUS HALIFAX CALL ME AS THEY USED TO CALL ME AT SAINT OMER BROTHER ANSELMO THE MOTHER WAS HALF INCLINED TO SMILE
5724-13364-0104 SINCERITY SO HENCEFORWARD BROTHER ANSELMO WAS ALMOST DOMESTICATED AT ROSE COTTAGE WHAT WOULD THE EARL HAVE SAID HAD A LITTLE BIRD FLOWN OVER TO LONDON AND TOLD HIM THAT HIS ONLY SON THE HEIR APPARENT TO HIS TITLE
5724-13364-0105 AND POLITICAL OPINIONS WAS IN CONSTANT AND OPEN ASSOCIATION FOR CLANDESTINE ACQUAINTANCE WAS AGAINST ALL OUR LAWS AND RULES WITH JOHN HALIFAX THE MILL OWNER JOHN HALIFAX THE RADICAL AS HE WAS STILL CALLED SOMETIMES
5724-13364-0106 IMBIBING PRINCIPLES MODES OF LIFE AND OF THOUGHT WHICH TO SAY THE LEAST WERE DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE HOUSE OF LUXMORE ABOVE ALL WHAT WOULD THAT NOBLE PARENT HAVE SAID HAD HE BEEN AWARE
5724-13364-0107 THAT THIS HIS ONLY SON FOR WHOM REPORT WHISPERED HE WAS ALREADY PLANNING A SPLENDID MARRIAGE
5724-13364-0108 THAT LORD RAVENEL WAS SPENDING ALL THE LOVE OF HIS LOVING NATURE IN THE HALF PATERNAL HALF LOVER LIKE SENTIMENT WHICH A YOUNG MAN WILL SOMETIMES LAVISH ON A MERE CHILD UPON JOHN HALIFAX'S LITTLE BLIND DAUGHTER MURIEL
5724-13364-0109 HE SAID SHE MADE HIM GOOD OUR CHILD OF PEACE HE WOULD SIT
5724-13364-0110 HIS PATRON SAINT AND THE LITTLE MAID IN HER QUIET WAY WAS VERY FOND OF HIM DELIGHTING IN HIS COMPANY WHEN HER FATHER WAS NOT BY BUT NO ONE EVER WAS TO HER LIKE HER FATHER THE CHIEF BOND BETWEEN HER AND LORD RAVENEL
5724-13364-0111 OR ANSELMO AS HE WOULD HAVE US CALL HIM WAS MUSIC HE TAUGHT HER TO PLAY ON THE ORGAN IN THE EMPTY CHURCH CLOSE BY THERE DURING THE LONG MIDSUMMER EVENINGS THEY TWO WOULD SIT FOR HOURS IN THE ORGAN GALLERY
5724-13364-0112 WHILE I LISTENED DOWN BELOW HARDLY BELIEVING THAT SUCH HEAVENLY SOUNDS COULD COME FROM THOSE SMALL CHILD FINGERS ALMOST READY TO FANCY SHE HAD CALLED DOWN SOME CELESTIAL HARMONIST TO AID HER IN PLAYING
5724-13364-0113 SINCE AS WE USED TO SAY BUT BY SOME INSTINCT NEVER SAID NOW
5724-13364-0114 JUST AT THIS TIME HER FATHER SAW SOMEWHAT LESS OF HER THAN USUAL HE WAS OPPRESSED WITH BUSINESS CARES DAILY HOURLY VEXATIONS ONLY TWICE A WEEK THE GREAT WATER WHEEL
5724-13364-0115 AND THEIR PRETTY SHAM CATARACTS WERE ALMOST ALWAYS LOW OR DRY IT CEASED TO BE A PLEASURE TO WALK IN THE GREEN HOLLOW BETWEEN THE TWO GRASSY HILLS WHICH HERETOFORE MURIEL AND I
5724-13364-0116 HAD LIKED EVEN BETTER THAN THE FLAT NOW SHE MISSED THE NOISE OF THE WATER THE CRY OF THE WATER HENS THE STIRRING OF THE REEDS ABOVE ALL SHE MISSED HER FATHER
5724-13364-0117 AND HARDLY EVER HAD A SPARE MINUTE EVEN FOR HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER HE WAS SETTING UP THAT WONDERFUL NOVELTY A STEAM ENGINE HE HAD ALREADY BEEN TO MANCHESTER AND ELSEWHERE
5724-13364-0118 AND SEEN HOW THE NEW POWER WAS APPLIED BY ARKWRIGHT HARGREAVES AND OTHERS
5724-13364-0119 AND MECHANICAL KNOWLEDGE FURNISHED THE REST
5724-13364-0120 ESPECIALLY IN OUR PRIMITIVE VALLEY UNTIL THE THING WAS COMPLETE SO THE IGNORANT SIMPLE MILL PEOPLE WHEN THEY CAME FOR THEIR EASY SATURDAY'S WAGES ONLY STOOD AND GAPED AT THE MASS OF IRON AND THE CURIOUSLY SHAPED BRICKWORK
5724-13364-0121 AND WONDERED WHAT ON EARTH THE MASTER WAS ABOUT
