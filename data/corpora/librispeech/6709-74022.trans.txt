6709-74022-0000 HE'LL MAKE THY FOOLISH BONES GO WITHOUT FLESH IN A FORTNIGHT AND THY SOUL WALK WITHOUT A BODY A SENNIGHT AFTER SHIRLEY
6709-74022-0001 AN HONEST NOTARY PUBLIC THE DESCENDANT OF A VERY ANCIENT AND BROKEN DOWN FAMILY AND THE OCCUPANT OF ONE OF THOSE OLD WEATHER BEATEN TENEMENTS WHICH REMIND YOU OF THE TIMES OF YOUR GREAT GRANDFATHER
6709-74022-0002 HE WAS A MAN OF AN UNOFFENDING QUIET DISPOSITION THE FATHER OF A FAMILY
6709-74022-0003 THE HEN OVER CROWED THE COCK AND THE NEIGHBORS WHEN THEY SPAKE OF THE NOTARY SHRUGGED THEIR SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED POOR FELLOW HIS SPURS WANT SHARPENING IN FINE YOU UNDERSTAND ME GENTLEMEN HE WAS HEN PECKED
6709-74022-0004 WELL
6709-74022-0005 AND AT LENGTH DISCOVERED A PLACE OF REST FAR BEYOND THE CARES AND CLAMORS OF DOMESTIC LIFE THIS WAS A LITTLE CAFE ESTAMINET A SHORT WAY OUT OF THE CITY WHITHER HE REPAIRED EVERY EVENING TO SMOKE HIS PIPE DRINK SUGAR WATER
6709-74022-0006 AND PLAY HIS FAVORITE GAME OF DOMINO THERE HE MET THE BOON COMPANIONS HE MOST LOVED HEARD ALL THE FLOATING CHITCHAT OF THE DAY LAUGHED WHEN HE WAS IN MERRY MOOD FOUND CONSOLATION WHEN HE WAS SAD
6709-74022-0007 AND AT ALL TIMES GAVE VENT TO HIS OPINIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING SNUBBED SHORT BY A FLAT CONTRADICTION NOW THE NOTARY'S BOSOM FRIEND WAS A DEALER IN CLARET AND COGNAC
6709-74022-0008 WHO LIVED ABOUT A LEAGUE FROM THE CITY AND ALWAYS PASSED HIS EVENINGS AT THE ESTAMINET HE WAS A GROSS CORPULENT FELLOW RAISED FROM A FULL BLOODED GASCON BREED AND SIRED BY A COMIC ACTOR OF SOME REPUTATION IN HIS WAY
6709-74022-0009 HE WAS REMARKABLE FOR NOTHING BUT HIS GOOD HUMOR HIS LOVE OF CARDS AND A STRONG PROPENSITY TO TEST THE QUALITY OF HIS OWN LIQUORS BY COMPARING THEM WITH THOSE SOLD AT OTHER PLACES
6709-74022-0010 AS EVIL COMMUNICATIONS CORRUPT GOOD MANNERS THE BAD PRACTICES OF THE WINE DEALER WON INSENSIBLY UPON THE WORTHY NOTARY AND BEFORE HE WAS AWARE OF IT HE FOUND HIMSELF WEANED FROM DOMINO AND SUGAR WATER
6709-74022-0011 INDEED IT NOT UNFREQUENTLY HAPPENED THAT AFTER A LONG SESSION AT THE ESTAMINET THE TWO FRIENDS GREW SO URBANE
6709-74022-0012 IN FRIENDLY DISPUTE WHICH SHOULD CONDUCT THE OTHER HOME THOUGH THIS COURSE OF LIFE AGREED WELL ENOUGH WITH THE SLUGGISH PHLEGMATIC TEMPERAMENT OF THE WINE DEALER
6709-74022-0013 IT SOON BEGAN TO PLAY THE VERY DEUSE WITH THE MORE SENSITIVE ORGANIZATION OF THE NOTARY AND FINALLY PUT HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM COMPLETELY OUT OF TUNE HE LOST HIS APPETITE BECAME GAUNT AND HAGGARD
6709-74022-0014 LEGIONS OF BLUE DEVILS HAUNTED HIM BY DAY AND BY NIGHT STRANGE FACES PEEPED THROUGH HIS BED CURTAINS AND THE NIGHTMARE SNORTED IN HIS EAR THE WORSE HE GREW THE MORE HE SMOKED AND TIPPLED
6709-74022-0015 AND THE MORE HE SMOKED AND TIPPLED WHY AS A MATTER OF COURSE THE WORSE HE GREW
6709-74022-0016 SHE MADE THE HOUSE TOO HOT FOR HIM HE RETREATED TO THE TAVERN SHE BROKE HIS LONG STEMMED PIPES UPON THE ANDIRONS HE SUBSTITUTED A SHORT STEMMED ONE WHICH FOR SAFE KEEPING HE CARRIED IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
6709-74022-0017 THUS THE UNHAPPY NOTARY RAN GRADUALLY DOWN AT THE HEEL WHAT WITH HIS BAD HABITS AND HIS DOMESTIC GRIEVANCES HE BECAME COMPLETELY HIPPED HE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS GOING TO DIE AND SUFFERED IN QUICK SUCCESSION
6709-74022-0018 ALL THE DISEASES THAT EVER BESET MORTAL MAN EVERY SHOOTING PAIN WAS AN ALARMING SYMPTOM EVERY UNEASY FEELING AFTER DINNER A SURE PROGNOSTIC OF SOME MORTAL DISEASE IN VAIN DID HIS FRIENDS ENDEAVOR TO REASON
6709-74022-0019 AND THEN TO LAUGH HIM OUT OF HIS STRANGE WHIMS FOR WHEN DID EVER JEST OR REASON CURE A SICK IMAGINATION HIS ONLY ANSWER WAS DO LET ME ALONE I KNOW BETTER THAN YOU WHAT AILS ME WELL GENTLEMEN
6709-74022-0020 THINGS WERE IN THIS STATE WHEN ONE AFTERNOON IN DECEMBER AS HE SAT MOPING IN HIS OFFICE WRAPPED IN AN OVERCOAT WITH A CAP ON HIS HEAD AND HIS FEET THRUST INTO A PAIR OF FURRED SLIPPERS A CABRIOLET STOPPED AT THE DOOR
6709-74022-0021 AND A LOUD KNOCKING WITHOUT AROUSED HIM FROM HIS GLOOMY REVERY IT WAS A MESSAGE FROM HIS FRIEND THE WINE DEALER WHO HAD BEEN SUDDENLY ATTACKED WITH A VIOLENT FEVER AND GROWING WORSE AND WORSE HAD NOW SENT IN THE GREATEST HASTE FOR THE NOTARY
6709-74022-0022 TO DRAW UP HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT THE CASE WAS URGENT AND ADMITTED NEITHER EXCUSE NOR DELAY AND THE NOTARY TYING A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS FACE AND BUTTONING UP TO THE CHIN JUMPED INTO THE CABRIOLET AND SUFFERED HIMSELF
6709-74022-0023 TO BE DRIVEN TO THE WINE DEALER'S HOUSE WHEN HE ARRIVED HE FOUND EVERYTHING IN THE GREATEST CONFUSION ON ENTERING THE HOUSE HE RAN AGAINST THE APOTHECARY WHO WAS COMING DOWN STAIRS WITH A FACE AS LONG AS YOUR ARM
6709-74022-0024 RUNNING UP AND DOWN AND WRINGING HER HANDS FOR FEAR THAT THE GOOD MAN SHOULD DIE WITHOUT MAKING HIS WILL HE SOON REACHED THE CHAMBER OF HIS SICK FRIEND AND FOUND HIM TOSSING ABOUT IN A PAROXYSM OF FEVER AND CALLING ALOUD FOR A DRAUGHT OF COLD WATER
6709-74022-0025 THE NOTARY SHOOK HIS HEAD HE THOUGHT THIS A FATAL SYMPTOM FOR TEN YEARS BACK THE WINE DEALER HAD BEEN SUFFERING UNDER A SPECIES OF HYDROPHOBIA WHICH SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE LEFT HIM
6709-74022-0026 WHEN THE SICK MAN SAW WHO STOOD BY HIS BEDSIDE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND EXCLAIMED AH MY DEAR FRIEND HAVE YOU COME AT LAST YOU SEE IT IS ALL OVER WITH ME

6709-74022-0028 HOW HOT IT IS HERE WATER WATER WATER WILL NOBODY GIVE ME A DROP OF COLD WATER
6709-74022-0029 AS THE CASE WAS AN URGENT ONE THE NOTARY MADE NO DELAY IN GETTING HIS PAPERS IN READINESS AND IN A SHORT TIME THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF THE WINE DEALER WAS DRAWN UP IN DUE FORM THE NOTARY GUIDING THE SICK MAN'S HAND AS HE SCRAWLED HIS SIGNATURE AT THE BOTTOM
6709-74022-0030 THE PHRASES OF THE CREDO AND PATERNOSTER WITH THE SHIBBOLETH OF THE DRAM SHOP AND THE CARD TABLE
6709-74022-0031 AT THE FEARFUL SCENE THAT WAS PASSING BEFORE HIM AND NOW AND THEN STRIVING TO KEEP UP HIS COURAGE BY A GLASS OF COGNAC ALREADY HIS FEARS WERE ON THE ALERT AND THE IDEA OF CONTAGION FLITTED TO AND FRO THROUGH HIS MIND
6709-74022-0032 AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR RETURNING HOME AT THAT MOMENT THE APOTHECARY TURNED ROUND TO HIM AND SAID DREADFUL SICKLY TIME THIS THE DISORDER SEEMS TO BE SPREADING WHAT DISORDER EXCLAIMED THE NOTARY WITH A MOVEMENT OF SURPRISE
6709-74022-0033 TWO DIED YESTERDAY AND THREE TO DAY CONTINUED THE APOTHECARY WITHOUT ANSWERING THE QUESTION VERY SICKLY TIME SIR VERY BUT WHAT DISORDER IS IT WHAT

6709-74022-0036 A SHARP BURNING PAIN IN THE RIGHT SIDE SAID THE APOTHECARY
6709-74022-0037 IN VAIN DID THE HOUSEKEEPER AND THE APOTHECARY STRIVE TO PACIFY HIM HE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE REASONED WITH HE ANSWERED THAT HE KNEW HIS OWN CONSTITUTION BETTER THAN THEY DID AND INSISTED UPON GOING HOME WITHOUT DELAY
6709-74022-0038 NOTHING IN THE WORLD BUT TO TAKE THE APOTHECARY'S HORSE WHICH STOOD HITCHED AT THE DOOR PATIENTLY WAITING HIS MASTER'S WILL WELL GENTLEMEN AS THERE WAS NO REMEDY OUR NOTARY MOUNTED
6709-74022-0039 UPON HIS HOMEWARD JOURNEY THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND GUSTY AND THE WIND RIGHT IN HIS TEETH OVERHEAD THE LEADEN CLOUDS WERE BEATING TO AND FRO AND THROUGH THEM THE NEWLY RISEN MOON SEEMED TO BE TOSSING
6709-74022-0040 NOW SWALLOWED UP IN A HUGE BILLOW OF CLOUD AND NOW LIFTED UPON ITS BOSOM AND DASHED WITH SILVERY SPRAY THE TREES BY THE ROAD SIDE GROANED WITH A SOUND OF EVIL OMEN AND BEFORE HIM LAY THREE MORTAL MILES
6709-74022-0041 BESET WITH A THOUSAND IMAGINARY PERILS OBEDIENT TO THE WHIP AND SPUR THE STEED LEAPED FORWARD BY FITS AND STARTS NOW DASHING AWAY IN A TREMENDOUS GALLOP AND NOW RELAXING INTO A LONG HARD TROT WHILE THE RIDER
6709-74022-0042 FILLED WITH SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE AND DIRE PRESENTIMENTS OF DEATH URGED HIM ON AS IF HE WERE FLEEING BEFORE THE PESTILENCE IN THIS WAY BY DINT OF WHISTLING AND SHOUTING AND BEATING RIGHT AND LEFT ONE MILE OF THE FATAL THREE WAS SAFELY PASSED
6709-74022-0043 THE APPREHENSIONS OF THE NOTARY HAD SO FAR SUBSIDED THAT HE EVEN SUFFERED THE POOR HORSE TO WALK UP HILL BUT THESE APPREHENSIONS WERE SUDDENLY REVIVED AGAIN WITH TENFOLD VIOLENCE BY A SHARP PAIN IN THE RIGHT SIDE WHICH SEEMED TO PIERCE HIM LIKE A NEEDLE
6709-74022-0044 IT IS UPON ME AT LAST GROANED THE FEAR STRICKEN MAN HEAVEN BE MERCIFUL TO ME THE GREATEST OF SINNERS AND MUST I DIE IN A DITCH AFTER ALL HE GET UP GET UP AND AWAY WENT HORSE AND RIDER AT FULL SPEED
6709-74022-0045 HURRY SCURRY UP HILL AND DOWN PANTING AND BLOWING LIKE A WHIRLWIND AT EVERY LEAP THE PAIN IN THE RIDER'S SIDE SEEMED TO INCREASE AT FIRST IT WAS A LITTLE POINT LIKE THE PRICK OF A NEEDLE THEN IT SPREAD TO THE SIZE OF A HALF FRANC PIECE
6709-74022-0046 THEN COVERED A PLACE AS LARGE AS THE PALM OF YOUR HAND IT GAINED UPON HIM FAST THE POOR MAN GROANED ALOUD IN AGONY FASTER AND FASTER SPED THE HORSE OVER THE FROZEN GROUND FARTHER AND FARTHER SPREAD THE PAIN OVER HIS SIDE TO COMPLETE THE DISMAL PICTURE THE STORM COMMENCED
6709-74022-0047 BUT SNOW AND RAIN AND COLD WERE NAUGHT TO HIM FOR THOUGH HIS ARMS AND LEGS WERE FROZEN TO ICICLES HE FELT IT NOT THE FATAL SYMPTOM WAS UPON HIM HE WAS DOOMED TO DIE NOT OF COLD BUT OF SCARLET FEVER
6709-74022-0048 AT LENGTH HE KNEW NOT HOW MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE HE REACHED THE GATE OF THE CITY A BAND OF ILL BRED DOGS THAT WERE SERENADING AT A CORNER OF THE STREET SEEING THE NOTARY DASH BY JOINED IN THE HUE AND CRY AND RAN BARKING AND YELPING AT HIS HEELS
6709-74022-0049 IT WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT AND ONLY HERE AND THERE A SOLITARY LAMP TWINKLED FROM AN UPPER STORY BUT ON WENT THE NOTARY
6709-74022-0050 THE GOOD WOMAN CAME TO THE WINDOW ALARMED AT SUCH A KNOCKING AND HOWLING AND CLATTERING AT HER DOOR SO LATE AT NIGHT AND THE NOTARY WAS TOO DEEPLY ABSORBED IN HIS OWN SORROWS TO OBSERVE THAT THE LAMP CAST THE SHADOW OF TWO HEADS ON THE WINDOW CURTAIN
6709-74022-0051 LET ME IN LET ME IN QUICK QUICK HE EXCLAIMED ALMOST BREATHLESS FROM TERROR AND FATIGUE WHO ARE YOU THAT COME TO DISTURB A LONE WOMAN AT THIS HOUR OF THE NIGHT CRIED A SHARP VOICE FROM ABOVE
6709-74022-0052 QUICK I BESEECH YOU FOR I AM DYING HERE IN THE STREET AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF DELAY AND A FEW MORE WORDS OF PARLEY THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND THE NOTARY STALKED INTO HIS DOMICILE PALE AND HAGGARD IN ASPECT AND AS STIFF AND STRAIGHT AS A GHOST
6709-74022-0053 CASED FROM HEAD TO HEEL IN AN ARMOR OF ICE AS THE GLARE OF THE LAMP FELL UPON HIM HE LOOKED LIKE A KNIGHT ERRANT MAILED IN STEEL BUT IN ONE PLACE HIS ARMOR WAS BROKEN ON HIS RIGHT SIDE WAS A CIRCULAR SPOT
6709-74022-0054 AS LARGE AS THE CROWN OF YOUR HAT AND ABOUT AS BLACK MY DEAR WIFE HE EXCLAIMED WITH MORE TENDERNESS THAN HE HAD EXHIBITED FOR MANY YEARS
6709-74022-0055 MY HOURS ARE NUMBERED I AM A DEAD MAN ALARMED AT THESE EXCLAMATIONS HIS WIFE STRIPPED OFF HIS OVERCOAT
6709-74022-0056 IT WAS THE NOTARY'S PIPE HE PLACED HIS HAND UPON HIS SIDE AND LO IT WAS BARE TO THE SKIN COAT WAISTCOAT AND LINEN WERE BURNT THROUGH AND THROUGH
6709-74022-0057 THE MYSTERY WAS SOON EXPLAINED SYMPTOM AND ALL THE NOTARY HAD PUT HIS PIPE INTO HIS POCKET WITHOUT KNOCKING OUT THE ASHES AND SO MY STORY ENDS
6709-74022-0058 THAT IS ALL WELL WHAT DOES YOUR STORY PROVE THAT IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE STORY IS TRUE
6709-74022-0059 YES HE DIED AFTERWARDS REPLIED THE STORY TELLER RATHER ANNOYED BY THE QUESTION
