3045-155991-0000 IN MY OWN JUDGMENT THE MOST IMPORTANT SERVICE THAT I RENDERED TO PEACE WAS THE VOYAGE OF THE BATTLE FLEET ROUND THE WORLD I HAD BECOME CONVINCED THAT FOR MANY REASONS IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE IT CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD
3045-155991-0001 BY OUR OWN PEOPLE ESPECIALLY BUT ALSO BY OTHER PEOPLES THAT THE PACIFIC WAS AS MUCH OUR HOME WATERS AS THE ATLANTIC AND THAT OUR FLEET COULD AND WOULD AT WILL PASS FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE TWO GREAT OCEANS
3045-155991-0002 IT SEEMED TO ME EVIDENT THAT SUCH A VOYAGE WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT THE NAVY ITSELF WOULD AROUSE POPULAR INTEREST IN AND ENTHUSIASM FOR THE NAVY AND WOULD MAKE FOREIGN NATIONS ACCEPT AS A MATTER OF COURSE
3045-155991-0003 THAT OUR FLEET SHOULD FROM TIME TO TIME BE GATHERED IN THE PACIFIC JUST AS FROM TIME TO TIME IT WAS GATHERED IN THE ATLANTIC
3045-155991-0004 AND THAT ITS PRESENCE IN ONE OCEAN WAS NO MORE TO BE ACCEPTED AS A MARK OF HOSTILITY TO ANY ASIATIC POWER THAN ITS PRESENCE IN THE ATLANTIC WAS TO BE ACCEPTED AS A MARK OF HOSTILITY TO ANY EUROPEAN POWER I DETERMINED ON THE MOVE
3045-155991-0005 WITHOUT CONSULTING THE CABINET PRECISELY AS I TOOK PANAMA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE CABINET A COUNCIL OF WAR NEVER FIGHTS AND IN A CRISIS THE DUTY OF A LEADER IS TO LEAD
3045-155991-0006 AND NOT TO TAKE REFUGE BEHIND THE GENERALLY TIMID WISDOM OF A MULTITUDE OF COUNCILLORS AT THAT TIME AS I HAPPEN TO KNOW NEITHER THE ENGLISH NOR THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVED IT POSSIBLE TO TAKE A FLEET OF GREAT BATTLESHIPS ROUND THE WORLD
3045-155991-0007 THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THEIR OWN FLEETS COULD PERFORM THE FEAT AND STILL LESS DID THEY BELIEVE THAT THE AMERICAN FLEET COULD I MADE UP MY MIND THAT IT WAS TIME TO HAVE A SHOW DOWN IN THE MATTER
3045-155991-0008 MANY PERSONS PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY PROTESTED AGAINST THE MOVE ON THE GROUND THAT JAPAN WOULD ACCEPT IT AS A THREAT TO THIS I ANSWERED NOTHING IN PUBLIC IN PRIVATE I SAID THAT I DID NOT BELIEVE JAPAN WOULD SO REGARD IT
3045-155991-0009 BECAUSE JAPAN KNEW MY SINCERE FRIENDSHIP AND ADMIRATION FOR HER
3045-155991-0010 AND THAT IF THERE WERE ANY SUCH FEELING ON THE PART OF JAPAN AS WAS ALLEGED THAT VERY FACT RENDERED IT IMPERATIVE THAT THAT FLEET SHOULD GO WHEN IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN TEN I WAS IN EUROPE
3045-155991-0011 I WAS INTERESTED TO FIND THAT HIGH NAVAL AUTHORITIES IN BOTH GERMANY AND ITALY HAD EXPECTED THAT WAR WOULD COME AT THE TIME OF THE VOYAGE
3045-155991-0012 I ANSWERED THAT I DID NOT EXPECT IT THAT I BELIEVED THAT JAPAN WOULD FEEL AS FRIENDLY IN THE MATTER AS WE DID BUT THAT IF MY EXPECTATIONS HAD PROVED MISTAKEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROOF POSITIVE THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ATTACKED ANYHOW
3045-155991-0013 AND THAT IN SUCH EVENT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENORMOUS GAIN TO HAVE HAD THE THREE MONTHS PRELIMINARY PREPARATION WHICH ENABLED THE FLEET TO START PERFECTLY EQUIPPED IN A PERSONAL INTERVIEW BEFORE THEY LEFT I HAD EXPLAINED TO THE OFFICERS IN COMMAND
3045-155991-0014 THAT I BELIEVED THE TRIP WOULD BE ONE OF ABSOLUTE PEACE BUT THAT THEY WERE TO TAKE EXACTLY THE SAME PRECAUTIONS AGAINST SUDDEN ATTACK OF ANY KIND AS IF WE WERE AT WAR WITH ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH
3045-155991-0015 AND THAT NO EXCUSE OF ANY KIND WOULD BE ACCEPTED IF THERE WERE A SUDDEN ATTACK OF ANY KIND AND WE WERE TAKEN UNAWARES MY PRIME PURPOSE WAS TO IMPRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THIS PURPOSE WAS FULLY ACHIEVED
3045-155991-0016 THE CRUISE DID MAKE A VERY DEEP IMPRESSION ABROAD BOASTING ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE DONE DOES NOT IMPRESS FOREIGN NATIONS AT ALL EXCEPT UNFAVORABLY BUT POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENT DOES
3045-155991-0017 AND THE TWO AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENTS THAT REALLY IMPRESSED FOREIGN PEOPLES DURING THE FIRST DOZEN YEARS OF THIS CENTURY WERE THE DIGGING OF THE PANAMA CANAL AND THE CRUISE OF THE BATTLE FLEET ROUND THE WORLD
3045-155991-0018 BUT THE IMPRESSION MADE ON OUR OWN PEOPLE WAS OF FAR GREATER CONSEQUENCE NO SINGLE THING IN THE HISTORY OF THE NEW UNITED STATES NAVY HAS DONE AS MUCH TO STIMULATE POPULAR INTEREST AND BELIEF IN IT AS THE WORLD CRUISE
3045-155991-0019 THIS EFFECT WAS FORECAST IN A WELL INFORMED AND FRIENDLY ENGLISH PERIODICAL THE LONDON SPECTATOR WRITING IN OCTOBER NINETEEN O SEVEN A MONTH BEFORE THE FLEET SAILED FROM HAMPTON ROADS THE SPECTATOR SAID
3045-155991-0020 ALL OVER AMERICA THE PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW THE MOVEMENTS OF THE FLEET THEY WILL LEARN SOMETHING OF THE INTRICATE DETAILS OF THE COALING AND COMMISSARIAT WORK UNDER WARLIKE CONDITIONS AND IN A WORD THEIR ATTENTION WILL BE AROUSED
3045-155991-0021 NEXT TIME MISTER ROOSEVELT OR HIS REPRESENTATIVES APPEAL TO THE COUNTRY FOR NEW BATTLESHIPS THEY WILL DO SO TO PEOPLE WHOSE MINDS HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THE NAVAL PROGRAMME WILL NOT HAVE STOOD STILL
3045-155991-0022 WE ARE SURE THAT APART FROM INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE EXISTING FLEET THIS IS THE AIM WHICH MISTER ROOSEVELT HAS IN MIND HE HAS A POLICY WHICH PROJECTS ITSELF FAR INTO THE FUTURE
3045-155991-0023 BUT IT IS AN ENTIRE MISREADING OF IT TO SUPPOSE THAT IT IS AIMED NARROWLY AND DEFINITELY AT ANY SINGLE POWER I FIRST DIRECTED THE FLEET OF SIXTEEN BATTLESHIPS TO GO ROUND THROUGH THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN TO SAN FRANCISCO
3045-155991-0024 FROM THENCE I ORDERED THEM TO NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA THEN TO THE PHILIPPINES CHINA AND JAPAN AND HOME THROUGH SUEZ THEY STOPPED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TO HELP THE SUFFERERS FROM THE EARTHQUAKE AT MESSINA BY THE WAY
3045-155991-0025 AND DID THIS WORK AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEY HAD DONE ALL THEIR OTHER WORK ADMIRAL EVANS COMMANDED THE FLEET TO SAN FRANCISCO THERE ADMIRAL SPERRY TOOK IT ADMIRALS THOMAS WAINWRIGHT AND SCHROEDER RENDERED DISTINGUISHED SERVICE UNDER EVANS AND SPERRY
3045-155991-0026 THE COALING AND OTHER PREPARATIONS WERE MADE IN SUCH EXCELLENT SHAPE BY THE DEPARTMENT THAT THERE WAS NEVER A HITCH NOT SO MUCH AS THE DELAY OF AN HOUR IN KEEPING EVERY APPOINTMENT MADE ALL THE REPAIRS WERE MADE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
3045-155991-0027 THE SHIP CONCERNED MERELY FALLING OUT OF COLUMN FOR A FEW HOURS AND WHEN THE JOB WAS DONE STEAMING AT SPEED UNTIL SHE REGAINED HER POSITION
3045-155991-0028 AS SOON AS IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE VOYAGE WAS TO BE UNDERTAKEN MEN CROWDED TO ENLIST JUST AS FREELY FROM THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AS FROM THE SEABOARD AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE SPANISH WAR THE SHIPS PUT TO SEA OVERMANNED
3045-155991-0029 AND BY AS STALWART A SET OF MEN OF WAR'S MEN AS EVER LOOKED THROUGH A PORTHOLE
3045-155991-0030 THAT IN ALL THE PORTS IN WHICH THEY LANDED THEIR CONDUCT WAS EXEMPLARY THE FLEET PRACTICED INCESSANTLY DURING THE VOYAGE BOTH WITH THE GUNS AND IN BATTLE TACTICS AND CAME HOME A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT FIGHTING INSTRUMENT THAN WHEN IT STARTED SIXTEEN MONTHS BEFORE
3045-155991-0031 THE BEST MEN OF COMMAND RANK IN OUR OWN SERVICE WERE CONFIDENT THAT THE FLEET WOULD GO ROUND IN SAFETY IN SPITE OF THE INCREDULITY OF FOREIGN CRITICS EVEN THEY HOWEVER
3045-155991-0032 DID NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS WISE TO SEND THE TORPEDO CRAFT AROUND I ACCORDINGLY ACQUIESCED IN THEIR VIEWS
3045-155991-0033 BUT SHORTLY BEFORE THE FLEET STARTED I WENT IN THE GOVERNMENT YACHT MAYFLOWER TO INSPECT THE TARGET PRACTICE OFF PROVINCETOWN I WAS ACCOMPANIED BY TWO TORPEDO BOAT DESTROYERS IN CHARGE OF A COUPLE OF NAVAL LIEUTENANTS THOROUGH GAMECOCKS
3045-155991-0034 TOWARDS THE END OF THE DINNER THEY COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ASKING IF THE TORPEDO FLOTILLA WAS TO GO ROUND WITH THE BIG SHIPS I TOLD THEM NO THAT THE ADMIRALS AND CAPTAINS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TORPEDO BOATS COULD STAND IT
3045-155991-0035 AND BELIEVED THAT THE OFFICERS AND CREWS ABOARD THE COCKLE SHELLS WOULD BE WORN OUT BY THE CONSTANT PITCHING AND BOUNCING AND THE EVERLASTING NEED TO MAKE REPAIRS MY TWO GUESTS CHORUSED AN EAGER ASSURANCE THAT THE BOATS COULD STAND IT
3045-155991-0036 THEY ASSURED ME THAT THE ENLISTED MEN WERE EVEN MORE ANXIOUS TO GO THAN WERE THE OFFICERS MENTIONING THAT ON ONE OF THEIR BOATS THE TERMS OF ENLISTMENT OF MOST OF THE CREW WERE OUT AND THE MEN WERE WAITING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT TO REENLIST
3045-155991-0037 AS THEY DID NOT CARE TO DO SO UNLESS THE BOATS WERE TO GO ON THE CRUISE I ANSWERED THAT I WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO ACCEPT THE WORD OF THE MEN WHO WERE TO DO THE JOB AND THAT THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY GO AND WITHIN HALF AN HOUR I SENT OUT THE ORDER FOR THE FLOTILLA TO BE GOT READY
3045-155991-0038 IT WENT ROUND IN FINE SHAPE NOT A BOAT BEING LAID UP I FELT THAT THE FEAT REFLECTED EVEN MORE CREDIT UPON THE NAVY THAN DID THE CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE BIG SHIPS
3045-155991-0039 MAY EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN O EIGHT MY DEAR CAPTAIN CONE A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE FEAT OF OUR BATTLESHIP FLEET IN ENCIRCLING SOUTH AMERICA AND GETTING TO SAN FRANCISCO
3045-155991-0040 YET IF I SHOULD DRAW ANY DISTINCTION AT ALL IT WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF YOU AND YOUR ASSOCIATES WHO HAVE TAKEN OUT THE TORPEDO FLOTILLA YOURS WAS AN EVEN MORE NOTABLE FEAT
3045-155991-0041 AND EVERY OFFICER AND EVERY ENLISTED MAN IN THE TORPEDO BOAT FLOTILLA HAS THE RIGHT TO FEEL THAT HE HAS RENDERED DISTINGUISHED SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES NAVY AND THEREFORE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND I WISH I COULD THANK EACH OF THEM PERSONALLY
3045-155991-0042 WILL YOU HAVE THIS LETTER READ BY THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF EACH TORPEDO BOAT TO HIS OFFICERS AND CREW SINCERELY YOURS THEODORE ROOSEVELT LIEUTENANT COMMANDER HUTCH I CONE U S N
3045-155991-0043 COMMANDING SECOND TORPEDO FLOTILLA
3045-155991-0044 THERE WERE VARIOUS AMUSING FEATURES CONNECTED WITH THE TRIP MOST OF THE WEALTHY PEOPLE AND LEADERS OF OPINION IN THE EASTERN CITIES WERE PANIC STRUCK AT THE PROPOSAL TO TAKE THE FLEET AWAY FROM ATLANTIC WATERS
3045-155991-0045 THE GREAT NEW YORK DAILIES ISSUED FRANTIC APPEALS TO CONGRESS TO STOP THE FLEET FROM GOING THE HEAD OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON NAVAL AFFAIRS ANNOUNCED THAT THE FLEET SHOULD NOT AND COULD NOT GO BECAUSE CONGRESS WOULD REFUSE TO APPROPRIATE THE MONEY HE BEING FROM AN EASTERN SEABOARD STATE
3045-155991-0046 HOWEVER I ANNOUNCED IN RESPONSE THAT I HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO TAKE THE FLEET AROUND TO THE PACIFIC ANYHOW THAT THE FLEET WOULD CERTAINLY GO AND THAT IF CONGRESS DID NOT CHOOSE TO APPROPRIATE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THE FLEET BACK WHY IT WOULD STAY IN THE PACIFIC
3045-155991-0047 THERE WAS NO FURTHER DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE MONEY IT WAS NOT ORIGINALLY MY INTENTION THAT THE FLEET SHOULD VISIT AUSTRALIA BUT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SENT A MOST CORDIAL INVITATION WHICH I GLADLY ACCEPTED
3045-155991-0048 FOR I HAVE AS EVERY AMERICAN OUGHT TO HAVE A HEARTY ADMIRATION FOR AND FELLOW FEELING WITH AUSTRALIA AND I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA SHOULD BE READY TO STAND BACK OF AUSTRALIA IN ANY SERIOUS EMERGENCY THE RECEPTION ACCORDED THE FLEET IN AUSTRALIA WAS WONDERFUL
3045-155991-0049 THE CONSIDERATE GENEROUS AND OPEN HANDED HOSPITALITY WITH WHICH THE ENTIRE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE TREATED OUR OFFICERS AND MEN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPASSED HAD THEY BEEN OUR OWN COUNTRYMEN THE FLEET FIRST VISITED SYDNEY WHICH HAS A SINGULARLY BEAUTIFUL HARBOR
3045-155991-0050 THE DAY AFTER THE ARRIVAL ONE OF OUR CAPTAINS NOTICED A MEMBER OF HIS CREW TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP ON A BENCH IN THE PARK HE HAD FIXED ABOVE HIS HEAD A LARGE PAPER WITH SOME LINES EVIDENTLY DESIGNED TO FORESTALL ANY QUESTIONS FROM FRIENDLY WOULD BE HOSTS
3045-155991-0051 I AM DELIGHTED WITH THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE I THINK YOUR HARBOR THE FINEST IN THE WORLD I AM VERY TIRED AND WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SLEEP
3045-155991-0052 THE MOST NOTEWORTHY INCIDENT OF THE CRUISE WAS THE RECEPTION GIVEN TO OUR FLEET IN JAPAN IN COURTESY AND GOOD BREEDING THE JAPANESE CAN CERTAINLY TEACH MUCH TO THE NATIONS OF THE WESTERN WORLD
3045-155991-0053 I HAD BEEN VERY SURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN WOULD UNDERSTAND ARIGHT WHAT THE CRUISE MEANT AND WOULD ACCEPT THE VISIT OF OUR FLEET AS THE SIGNAL HONOR WHICH IT WAS MEANT TO BE A PROOF OF THE HIGH REGARD AND FRIENDSHIP I FELT
3045-155991-0054 AND WHICH I WAS CERTAIN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FELT FOR THE GREAT ISLAND EMPIRE THE EVENT EVEN SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS I CANNOT TOO STRONGLY EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION OF THE GENEROUS COURTESY THE JAPANESE SHOWED THE OFFICERS AND CREWS OF OUR FLEET
3045-155991-0055 AND I MAY ADD THAT EVERY MAN OF THEM CAME BACK A FRIEND AND ADMIRER OF THE JAPANESE ADMIRAL SPERRY WROTE ME A LETTER OF MUCH INTEREST DEALING NOT ONLY WITH THE RECEPTION IN TOKYO BUT WITH THE WORK OF OUR MEN AT SEA I HEREWITH GIVE IT ALMOST IN FULL
3045-155991-0056 TWENTY EIGHT OCTOBER NINETEEN O EIGHT DEAR MISTER ROOSEVELT MY OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE VISIT TO JAPAN GOES FORWARD IN THIS MAIL BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE AFFAIR SO SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED WHICH CANNOT WELL BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
3045-155991-0057 YOU ARE PERHAPS AWARE THAT MISTER DENISON OF THE JAPANESE FOREIGN OFFICE WAS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE HAGUE
3045-155991-0058 DESIRING TO AVOID EVERY POSSIBILITY OF TROUBLE OR MISUNDERSTANDING I WROTE TO HIM LAST JUNE EXPLAINING FULLY THE CHARACTER OF OUR MEN WHICH THEY HAVE SO WELL LIVED UP TO
3045-155991-0059 VERY FEW OF THEM GO INTO A DRINKING PLACE EXCEPT TO GET A RESTING PLACE NOT TO BE FOUND ELSEWHERE PAYING FOR IT BY TAKING A DRINK I ALSO EXPLAINED OUR SYSTEM OF LANDING WITH LIBERTY MEN AN UNARMED PATROL PROPERLY OFFICERED
3045-155991-0060 TO QUIETLY TAKE IN CHARGE AND SEND OFF TO THEIR SHIPS ANY MEN WHO SHOWED THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF DISORDERLY CONDUCT THIS LETTER HE SHOWED TO THE MINISTER OF THE NAVY WHO HIGHLY APPROVED OF ALL OUR ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING THE PATROL OF WHICH I FEARED THEY MIGHT BE JEALOUS
3045-155991-0061 MISTER DENISON'S REPLY REACHED ME IN MANILA WITH A MEMORANDUM FROM THE MINISTER OF THE NAVY WHICH REMOVED ALL DOUBTS THREE TEMPORARY PIERS WERE BUILT FOR OUR BOAT LANDINGS EACH THREE HUNDRED FEET LONG BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND DECORATED
3045-155991-0062 THE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS DID NOT PERMIT TWO OR THREE THOUSAND SAILORS TO REMAIN ON SHORE BUT THE AMPLE LANDINGS PERMITTED THEM TO BE HANDLED NIGHT AND DAY WITH PERFECT ORDER AND SAFETY
3045-155991-0063 REPUTABLE MONEY CHANGERS AND AS MANY AS A THOUSAND ENGLISH SPEAKING JAPANESE COLLEGE STUDENTS ACTED AS VOLUNTEER GUIDES BESIDES JAPANESE SAILORS AND PETTY OFFICERS DETAILED FOR THE PURPOSE IN TOKYO THERE WERE A GREAT MANY EXCELLENT REFRESHMENT PLACES
3045-155991-0064 WHERE THE MEN GOT EXCELLENT MEALS AND COULD REST SMOKE AND WRITE LETTERS AND IN NONE OF THESE PLACES WOULD THEY ALLOW THE MEN TO PAY ANYTHING THOUGH THEY WERE MORE THAN READY TO DO SO THE ARRANGEMENTS WERE MARVELOUSLY PERFECT AS SOON AS YOUR TELEGRAM OF OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH
3045-155991-0065 GIVING THE ADDRESS TO BE MADE TO THE EMPEROR WAS RECEIVED I GAVE COPIES OF IT TO OUR AMBASSADOR TO BE SENT TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE IT SEEMS THAT THE EMPEROR HAD ALREADY PREPARED A VERY CORDIAL ADDRESS TO BE FORWARDED THROUGH ME TO YOU AFTER DELIVERY AT THE AUDIENCE
3045-155991-0066 BUT YOUR TELEGRAM REVERSED THE SITUATION AND HIS REPLY WAS PREPARED I AM CONVINCED THAT YOUR KIND AND COURTEOUS INITIATIVE ON THIS OCCASION HELPED CAUSE THE PLEASANT FEELING WHICH WAS SO OBVIOUS IN THE EMPEROR'S BEARING AT THE LUNCHEON WHICH FOLLOWED THE AUDIENCE X
3045-155991-0067 WHO IS RETICENT AND CONSERVATIVE TOLD ME THAT NOT ONLY THE EMPEROR BUT ALL THE MINISTERS WERE PROFOUNDLY GRATIFIED BY THE COURSE OF EVENTS I AM CONFIDENT THAT NOT EVEN THE MOST TRIFLING INCIDENT HAS TAKEN PLACE WHICH COULD IN ANY WAY MAR THE GENERAL SATISFACTION
3045-155991-0068 AND OUR AMBASSADOR HAS EXPRESSED TO ME HIS GREAT SATISFACTION WITH ALL THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE OWING TO HEAVY WEATHER ENCOUNTERED ON THE PASSAGE UP FROM MANILA THE FLEET WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED TONS OF COAL
3045-155991-0069 THE YANKTON REMAINED BEHIND TO KEEP UP COMMUNICATION FOR A FEW DAYS AND YESTERDAY SHE TRANSMITTED THE EMPEROR'S TELEGRAM TO YOU WHICH WAS SENT IN REPLY TO YOUR MESSAGE THROUGH OUR AMBASSADOR AFTER THE SAILING OF THE FLEET
3045-155991-0070 IT MUST BE PROFOUNDLY GRATIFYING TO YOU TO HAVE THE MISSION ON WHICH YOU SENT THE FLEET TERMINATE SO HAPPILY AND I AM PROFOUNDLY THANKFUL THAT OWING TO THE CONFIDENCE WHICH YOU DISPLAYED IN GIVING ME THIS COMMAND
3045-155991-0071 AS FOR THE EFFECT OF THE CRUISE UPON THE TRAINING DISCIPLINE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FLEET THE GOOD CANNOT BE EXAGGERATED IT IS A WAR GAME IN EVERY DETAIL THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN MAINTAINED WITH AN EFFICIENCY HITHERTO UNHEARD OF
3045-155991-0072 BETWEEN HONOLULU AND AUCKLAND
3045-155991-0073 WE WERE OUT OF COMMUNICATION WITH A CABLE STATION FOR ONLY ONE NIGHT
3045-155991-0074 BETWEEN AUCKLAND AND SYDNEY WERE ONLY ABLE TO DO SO FOR A FEW HOURS THE OFFICERS AND MEN AS SOON AS WE PUT TO SEA TURN TO THEIR GUNNERY AND TACTICAL WORK FAR MORE EAGERLY THAN THEY GO TO FUNCTIONS
3045-155991-0075 EVERY MORNING CERTAIN SHIPS LEAVE THE COLUMN AND MOVE OFF SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND YARDS AS TARGETS FOR RANGE MEASURING FIRE CONTROL AND BATTERY PRACTICE FOR THE OTHERS AND AT NIGHT CERTAIN SHIPS DO THE SAME THING FOR NIGHT BATTERY PRACTICE
3045-155991-0076 I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT THIS PRACTICE IS UNSATISFACTORY AND IN SOME POINTS MISLEADING OWING TO THE FACT THAT THE SHIPS ARE PAINTED WHITE AT PORTLAND IN NINETEEN O THREE I SAW ADMIRAL BARKER'S WHITE BATTLESHIPS UNDER THE SEARCHLIGHTS OF THE ARMY AT A DISTANCE OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND YARDS
3045-155991-0077 SEVEN SEA MILES WITHOUT GLASSES WHILE THE HARTFORD A BLACK SHIP WAS NEVER DISCOVERED AT ALL THOUGH SHE PASSED WITHIN A MILE AND A HALF I HAVE FOR YEARS WHILE A MEMBER OF THE GENERAL BOARD
3045-155991-0078 I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANY ONE NOW DISSENTS FROM MY VIEW ADMIRAL WAINWRIGHT STRONGLY CONCURS AND THE WAR COLLEGE CONFERENCE RECOMMENDED IT YEAR AFTER YEAR WITHOUT A DISSENTING VOICE
3045-155991-0079 IN THE AFTERNOONS THE FLEET HAS TWO OR THREE HOURS PRACTICE AT BATTLE MANEUVERS WHICH EXCITE AS KEEN INTEREST AS GUNNERY EXERCISES THE COMPETITION IN COAL ECONOMY GOES ON AUTOMATICALLY AND REACTS IN A HUNDRED WAYS
3045-155991-0080 IT HAS REDUCED THE WASTE IN THE USE OF ELECTRIC LIGHT AND WATER AND CERTAIN CHIEF ENGINEERS ARE SAID TO KEEP MEN RANGING OVER THE SHIPS ALL NIGHT TURNING OUT EVERY LIGHT NOT IN ACTUAL AND IMMEDIATE USE
3045-155991-0081 PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFECT IS THE KEEN HUNT FOR DEFECTS IN THE MACHINERY CAUSING WASTE OF POWER THE YANKTON BY RESETTING VALVES INCREASED HER SPEED FROM TEN TO ELEVEN AND A HALF KNOTS ON THE SAME EXPENDITURE ALL THIS HAS BEEN DONE BUT THE FIELD IS WIDENING
3045-155991-0082 THE WORK HAS ONLY BEGUN C S SPERRY WHEN I LEFT THE PRESIDENCY I FINISHED SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS OF ADMINISTRATION DURING WHICH NOT ONE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED AGAINST A FOREIGN FOE WE WERE AT ABSOLUTE PEACE
3045-155991-0083 AND THERE WAS NO NATION IN THE WORLD WITH WHOM A WAR CLOUD THREATENED NO NATION IN THE WORLD WHOM WE HAD WRONGED OR FROM WHOM WE HAD ANYTHING TO FEAR THE CRUISE OF THE BATTLE FLEET WAS NOT THE LEAST OF THE CAUSES WHICH ENSURED SO PEACEFUL AN OUTLOOK
3045-155991-0084 WHEN THE FLEET RETURNED AFTER ITS SIXTEEN MONTHS VOYAGE AROUND THE WORLD I WENT DOWN TO HAMPTON ROADS TO GREET IT THE DAY WAS WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND NINETEEN O SEVEN LITERALLY ON THE MINUTE THE HOMING BATTLECRAFT CAME INTO VIEW
3045-155991-0085 ON THE FLAGSHIP OF THE ADMIRAL I SPOKE TO THE OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN AS FOLLOWS ADMIRAL SPERRY OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE BATTLE FLEET OVER A YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE YOU STEAMED OUT OF THIS HARBOR AND OVER THE WORLD'S RIM
3045-155991-0086 AND THIS MORNING THE HEARTS OF ALL WHO SAW YOU THRILLED WITH PRIDE AS THE HULLS OF THE MIGHTY WARSHIPS LIFTED ABOVE THE HORIZON YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE NORTHERN AND THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES FOUR TIMES YOU HAVE CROSSED THE LINE YOU HAVE STEAMED THROUGH ALL THE GREAT OCEANS
3045-155991-0087 YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE COAST OF EVERY CONTINENT EVER YOUR GENERAL COURSE HAS BEEN WESTWARD AND NOW YOU COME BACK TO THE PORT FROM WHICH YOU SET SAIL THIS IS THE FIRST BATTLE FLEET THAT HAS EVER CIRCUMNAVIGATED THE GLOBE
3045-155991-0088 THOSE WHO PERFORM THE FEAT AGAIN CAN BUT FOLLOW IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS THE LITTLE TORPEDO FLOTILLA WENT WITH YOU AROUND SOUTH AMERICA THROUGH THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN TO OUR OWN PACIFIC COAST THE ARMORED CRUISER SQUADRON MET YOU
3045-155991-0089 AND LEFT YOU AGAIN WHEN YOU WERE HALF WAY ROUND THE WORLD YOU HAVE FALSIFIED EVERY PREDICTION OF THE PROPHETS OF FAILURE IN ALL YOUR LONG CRUISE NOT AN ACCIDENT WORTHY OF MENTION HAS HAPPENED TO A SINGLE BATTLESHIP
3045-155991-0090 NOR YET TO THE CRUISERS OR TORPEDO BOATS YOU LEFT THIS COAST IN A HIGH STATE OF BATTLE EFFICIENCY AND YOU RETURN WITH YOUR EFFICIENCY INCREASED BETTER PREPARED THAN WHEN YOU LEFT NOT ONLY IN PERSONNEL BUT EVEN IN MATERIAL
3045-155991-0091 DURING YOUR WORLD CRUISE YOU HAVE TAKEN YOUR REGULAR GUNNERY PRACTICE AND SKILLED THOUGH YOU WERE BEFORE WITH THE GUNS YOU HAVE GROWN MORE SKILFUL STILL AND THROUGH PRACTICE YOU HAVE IMPROVED IN BATTLE TACTICS THOUGH HERE THERE IS MORE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THAN IN YOUR GUNNERY
3045-155991-0092 INCIDENTALLY I SUPPOSE I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT ONE MEASURE OF YOUR FITNESS MUST BE YOUR CLEAR RECOGNITION OF THE NEED ALWAYS STEADILY TO STRIVE TO RENDER YOURSELVES MORE FIT
3045-155991-0093 YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR MINDS THAT FROM THAT MOMENT YOU WILL BEGIN TO GO BACKWARD AS A WAR MACHINE THE FLEET COMES BACK IN BETTER SHAPE THAN IT WENT OUT IN ADDITION YOU THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THIS FORMIDABLE FIGHTING FORCE
3045-155991-0094 HAVE SHOWN YOURSELVES THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE AMBASSADORS AND HERALDS OF PEACE WHEREVER YOU HAVE LANDED YOU HAVE BORNE YOURSELVES SO AS TO MAKE US AT HOME PROUD OF BEING YOUR COUNTRYMEN
3045-155991-0095 YOU HAVE SHOWN THAT THE BEST TYPE OF FIGHTING MAN OF THE SEA KNOWS HOW TO APPEAR TO THE UTMOST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE WHEN HIS BUSINESS IS TO BEHAVE HIMSELF ON SHORE AND TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION IN A FOREIGN LAND
