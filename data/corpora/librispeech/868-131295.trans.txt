868-131295-0000 THE PRIMEVAL MAN IN OFFERING THE FIRST GARLAND TO HIS MAIDEN THEREBY TRANSCENDED THE BRUTE
868-131295-0001 HE ENTERED THE REALM OF ART WHEN HE PERCEIVED THE SUBTLE USE OF THE USELESS IN JOY OR SADNESS FLOWERS ARE OUR CONSTANT FRIENDS WE EAT DRINK SING DANCE AND FLIRT WITH THEM WE WED AND CHRISTEN WITH FLOWERS WE DARE NOT DIE WITHOUT THEM
868-131295-0002 WE HAVE WORSHIPPED WITH THE LILY WE HAVE MEDITATED WITH THE LOTUS WE HAVE CHARGED IN BATTLE ARRAY WITH THE ROSE AND THE CHRYSANTHEMUM WE HAVE EVEN ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK IN THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS HOW COULD WE LIVE WITHOUT THEM IT FRIGHTENS ONE TO CONCEIVE OF A WORLD BEREFT OF THEIR PRESENCE
868-131295-0003 WHAT SOLACE DO THEY NOT BRING TO THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WHAT A LIGHT OF BLISS TO THE DARKNESS OF WEARY SPIRITS THEIR SERENE TENDERNESS RESTORES TO US OUR WANING CONFIDENCE IN THE UNIVERSE EVEN AS THE INTENT GAZE OF A BEAUTIFUL CHILD RECALLS OUR LOST HOPES
868-131295-0004 AT TWENTY A LUNATIC AT THIRTY A FAILURE AT FORTY A FRAUD AND AT FIFTY A CRIMINAL PERHAPS HE BECOMES A CRIMINAL BECAUSE HE HAS NEVER CEASED TO BE AN ANIMAL NOTHING IS REAL TO US BUT HUNGER
868-131295-0005 OURSELVES OUR GOD IS GREAT AND MONEY IS HIS PROPHET WE DEVASTATE NATURE IN ORDER TO MAKE SACRIFICE TO HIM WE BOAST THAT WE HAVE CONQUERED MATTER AND FORGET THAT IT IS MATTER THAT HAS ENSLAVED US
868-131295-0006 WHAT ATROCITIES DO WE NOT PERPETRATE IN THE NAME OF CULTURE AND REFINEMENT TELL ME GENTLE FLOWERS TEARDROPS OF THE STARS STANDING IN THE GARDEN NODDING YOUR HEADS TO THE BEES AS THEY SING OF THE DEWS AND THE SUNBEAMS ARE YOU AWARE OF THE FEARFUL DOOM THAT AWAITS YOU
868-131295-0007 SHE MAY SAY HOW LOVELY YOU ARE WHILE HER FINGERS ARE STILL MOIST WITH YOUR BLOOD TELL ME WILL THIS BE KINDNESS IT MAY BE YOUR FATE TO BE IMPRISONED IN THE HAIR OF ONE WHOM YOU KNOW TO BE HEARTLESS OR TO BE THRUST INTO THE BUTTONHOLE OF ONE
868-131295-0008 IT MAY EVEN BE YOUR LOT TO BE CONFINED IN SOME NARROW VESSEL WITH ONLY STAGNANT WATER TO QUENCH THE MADDENING THIRST THAT WARNS OF EBBING LIFE FLOWERS IF YOU WERE IN THE LAND OF THE MIKADO
868-131295-0009 YOU MIGHT SOME TIME MEET A DREAD PERSONAGE ARMED WITH SCISSORS AND A TINY SAW HE WOULD CALL HIMSELF A MASTER OF FLOWERS HE WOULD CLAIM THE RIGHTS OF A DOCTOR AND YOU WOULD INSTINCTIVELY HATE HIM
868-131295-0010 HE WOULD BURN YOU WITH RED HOT COALS TO STOP YOUR BLEEDING AND THRUST WIRES INTO YOU TO ASSIST YOUR CIRCULATION HE WOULD DIET YOU WITH SALT VINEGAR ALUM AND SOMETIMES VITRIOL BOILING WATER WOULD BE POURED ON YOUR FEET WHEN YOU SEEMED READY TO FAINT
868-131295-0011 IT WOULD BE HIS BOAST THAT HE COULD KEEP LIFE WITHIN YOU FOR TWO OR MORE WEEKS LONGER THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT HIS TREATMENT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AT ONCE WHEN YOU WERE FIRST CAPTURED
868-131295-0012 TO BE THROWN AWAY ON THE MORROW MUST BE SOMETHING ENORMOUS IF STRUNG TOGETHER THEY MIGHT GARLAND A CONTINENT BESIDE THIS UTTER CARELESSNESS OF LIFE THE GUILT OF THE FLOWER MASTER BECOMES INSIGNIFICANT
868-131295-0013 WHY WERE THE FLOWERS BORN SO BEAUTIFUL AND YET SO HAPLESS INSECTS CAN STING AND EVEN THE MEEKEST OF BEASTS WILL FIGHT WHEN BROUGHT TO BAY THE BIRDS WHOSE PLUMAGE IS SOUGHT TO DECK SOME BONNET CAN FLY FROM ITS PURSUER
868-131295-0014 THE FURRED ANIMAL WHOSE COAT YOU COVET FOR YOUR OWN MAY HIDE AT YOUR APPROACH ALAS THE ONLY FLOWER KNOWN TO HAVE WINGS IS THE BUTTERFLY ALL OTHERS STAND HELPLESS BEFORE THE DESTROYER IF THEY SHRIEK IN THEIR DEATH AGONY
868-131295-0015 THEIR CRY NEVER REACHES OUR HARDENED EARS WE ARE EVER BRUTAL TO THOSE WHO LOVE AND SERVE US IN SILENCE BUT THE TIME MAY COME WHEN FOR OUR CRUELTY WE SHALL BE DESERTED BY THESE BEST FRIENDS OF OURS
868-131295-0016 HAVE YOU NOT NOTICED THAT THE WILD FLOWERS ARE BECOMING SCARCER EVERY YEAR IT MAY BE THAT THEIR WISE MEN HAVE TOLD THEM TO DEPART TILL MAN BECOMES MORE HUMAN PERHAPS THEY HAVE MIGRATED TO HEAVEN
868-131295-0017 THE MAN OF THE POT IS FAR MORE HUMANE THAN HE OF THE SCISSORS
868-131295-0018 HIS FEUDS WITH PARASITES HIS HORROR OF FROSTS HIS ANXIETY WHEN THE BUDS COME SLOWLY HIS RAPTURE WHEN THE LEAVES ATTAIN THEIR LUSTRE IN THE EAST THE ART OF FLORICULTURE IS A VERY ANCIENT ONE
868-131295-0019 AND THE LOVES OF A POET AND HIS FAVORITE PLANT HAVE OFTEN BEEN RECORDED IN STORY AND SONG WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERAMICS DURING THE TANG AND SUNG DYNASTIES WE HEAR OF WONDERFUL RECEPTACLES MADE TO HOLD PLANTS NOT POTS BUT JEWELLED PALACES
868-131295-0020 A SPECIAL ATTENDANT WAS DETAILED TO WAIT UPON EACH FLOWER AND TO WASH ITS LEAVES WITH SOFT BRUSHES MADE OF RABBIT HAIR
868-131295-0021 THAT A WINTER PLUM SHOULD BE WATERED BY A PALE SLENDER MONK IN JAPAN ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OF THE NO DANCES THE HACHINOKI COMPOSED DURING THE ASHIKAGA PERIOD IS BASED UPON THE STORY OF AN IMPOVERISHED KNIGHT
868-131295-0022 WHO ON A FREEZING NIGHT IN LACK OF FUEL FOR A FIRE CUTS HIS CHERISHED PLANTS IN ORDER TO ENTERTAIN A WANDERING FRIAR
868-131295-0023 AND THE SACRIFICE IS NOT WITHOUT ITS REWARD THIS OPERA NEVER FAILS TO DRAW TEARS FROM A TOKIO AUDIENCE EVEN TO DAY GREAT PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN FOR THE PRESERVATION OF DELICATE BLOSSOMS
868-131295-0024 EMPEROR HUENSUNG OF THE TANG DYNASTY HUNG TINY GOLDEN BELLS ON THE BRANCHES IN HIS GARDEN TO KEEP OFF THE BIRDS HE IT WAS WHO WENT OFF IN THE SPRINGTIME WITH HIS COURT MUSICIANS TO GLADDEN THE FLOWERS WITH SOFT MUSIC
868-131295-0025 AND APPEALS TO US WITH THE GRIM HUMOUR OF A WARLIKE AGE AFTER REFERRING TO THE BEAUTY OF THE BLOSSOMS THE INSCRIPTION SAYS WHOEVER CUTS A SINGLE BRANCH OF THIS TREE SHALL FORFEIT A FINGER THEREFOR
868-131295-0026 WOULD THAT SUCH LAWS COULD BE ENFORCED NOWADAYS AGAINST THOSE WHO WANTONLY DESTROY FLOWERS AND MUTILATE OBJECTS OF ART YET EVEN IN THE CASE OF POT FLOWERS WE ARE INCLINED TO SUSPECT THE SELFISHNESS OF MAN
868-131295-0027 OF THE WESTERN LAKE TIS SAID THAT CHOWMUSHIH SLEPT IN A BOAT SO THAT HIS DREAMS MIGHT MINGLE WITH THOSE OF THE LOTUS IT WAS THE SAME SPIRIT WHICH MOVED THE EMPRESS KOMIO
868-131295-0028 ONE OF OUR MOST RENOWNED NARA SOVEREIGNS AS SHE SANG IF I PLUCK THEE
868-131295-0029 O FLOWER STANDING IN THE MEADOWS AS THOU ART I OFFER THEE TO THE BUDDHAS OF THE PAST OF THE PRESENT OF THE FUTURE HOWEVER LET US NOT BE TOO SENTIMENTAL
868-131295-0030 LET US BE LESS LUXURIOUS BUT MORE MAGNIFICENT SAID LAOTSE HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE PITILESS SAID KOBODAISHI FLOW FLOW FLOW FLOW THE CURRENT OF LIFE IS EVER ONWARD
868-131295-0031 DIE DIE DIE DIE DEATH COMES TO ALL DESTRUCTION FACES US WHEREVER WE TURN DESTRUCTION BELOW AND ABOVE DESTRUCTION BEHIND AND BEFORE CHANGE IS THE ONLY ETERNAL
868-131295-0032 WHY NOT AS WELCOME DEATH AS LIFE THEY ARE BUT COUNTERPARTS ONE OF THE OTHER THE NIGHT AND DAY OF BRAHMA THROUGH THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE OLD RE CREATION BECOMES POSSIBLE WE HAVE WORSHIPPED DEATH
868-131295-0033 THE MYSTIC FIRE CONSUMES OUR WEAKNESS THE SACRED SWORD CLEAVES THE BONDAGE OF DESIRE FROM OUR ASHES SPRINGS THE PHOENIX OF CELESTIAL HOPE OUT OF THE FREEDOM COMES A HIGHER REALISATION OF MANHOOD
868-131295-0034 WHY NOT DESTROY FLOWERS IF THEREBY WE CAN EVOLVE NEW FORMS ENNOBLING THE WORLD IDEA WE ONLY ASK THEM TO JOIN IN OUR SACRIFICE TO THE BEAUTIFUL WE SHALL ATONE FOR THE DEED BY CONSECRATING OURSELVES TO PURITY AND SIMPLICITY
868-131295-0035 THEY DO NOT CULL AT RANDOM BUT CAREFULLY SELECT EACH BRANCH OR SPRAY WITH AN EYE TO THE ARTISTIC COMPOSITION THEY HAVE IN MIND THEY WOULD BE ASHAMED SHOULD THEY CHANCE TO CUT MORE THAN WERE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IT MAY BE REMARKED IN THIS CONNECTION
868-131295-0036 THAT THEY ALWAYS ASSOCIATE THE LEAVES IF THERE BE ANY
868-131295-0037 IN THIS RESPECT AS IN MANY OTHERS THEIR METHOD DIFFERS FROM THAT PURSUED IN WESTERN COUNTRIES HERE WE ARE APT TO SEE ONLY THE FLOWER STEMS HEADS AS IT WERE WITHOUT BODY STUCK PROMISCUOUSLY INTO A VASE
868-131295-0038 WHEN A TEA MASTER HAS ARRANGED A FLOWER TO HIS SATISFACTION HE WILL PLACE IT ON THE TOKONOMA THE PLACE OF HONOUR IN A JAPANESE ROOM
868-131295-0039 NOT EVEN A PAINTING UNLESS THERE BE SOME SPECIAL AESTHETIC REASON FOR THE COMBINATION IT RESTS THERE LIKE AN ENTHRONED PRINCE AND THE GUESTS OR DISCIPLES ON ENTERING THE ROOM WILL SALUTE IT WITH A PROFOUND BOW BEFORE MAKING THEIR ADDRESSES TO THE HOST
868-131295-0040 DRAWINGS FROM MASTERPIECES ARE MADE AND PUBLISHED FOR THE EDIFICATION OF AMATEURS THE AMOUNT OF LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT IS QUITE VOLUMINOUS WHEN THE FLOWER FADES THE MASTER TENDERLY CONSIGNS IT TO THE RIVER OR CAREFULLY BURIES IT IN THE GROUND
868-131295-0041 THE BIRTH OF THE ART OF FLOWER ARRANGEMENT SEEMS TO BE SIMULTANEOUS WITH THAT OF TEAISM IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY OUR LEGENDS ASCRIBE THE FIRST FLOWER ARRANGEMENT TO THOSE EARLY BUDDHIST SAINTS WHO GATHERED THE FLOWERS STREWN BY THE STORM
868-131295-0042 AND IN THEIR INFINITE SOLICITUDE FOR ALL LIVING THINGS PLACED THEM IN VESSELS OF WATER IT IS SAID THAT SOAMI THE GREAT PAINTER AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE COURT OF ASHIKAGA YOSHIMASA
868-131295-0043 WITH THE PERFECTING OF THE TEA RITUAL UNDER RIKIU IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY FLOWER ARRANGEMENT ALSO ATTAINS ITS FULL GROWTH RIKIU AND HIS SUCCESSORS
868-131295-0044 KOBORI ENSHIU KATAGIRI SEKISHIU VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN FORMING NEW COMBINATIONS WE MUST REMEMBER HOWEVER THAT THE FLOWER WORSHIP OF THE TEA MASTERS FORMED ONLY A PART OF THEIR AESTHETIC RITUAL AND WAS NOT A DISTINCT RELIGION BY ITSELF
868-131295-0045 WAS SUBORDINATED TO THE TOTAL SCHEME OF DECORATION THUS SEKISHIU ORDAINED THAT WHITE PLUM BLOSSOMS SHOULD NOT BE MADE USE OF WHEN SNOW LAY IN THE GARDEN NOISY FLOWERS WERE RELENTLESSLY BANISHED FROM THE TEA ROOM
868-131295-0046 THE ADORATION OF THE FLOWER FOR ITS OWN SAKE BEGINS WITH THE RISE OF FLOWER MASTERS TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IT NOW BECOMES INDEPENDENT OF THE TEA ROOM AND KNOWS NO LAW SAVE THAT THE VASE IMPOSES ON IT
868-131295-0047 AIMED AT A CLASSIC IDEALISM CORRESPONDING TO THAT OF THE KANO ACADEMICIANS WE POSSESS RECORDS OF ARRANGEMENTS BY THE EARLY MASTERS OF THE SCHOOL WHICH ALMOST REPRODUCE THE FLOWER PAINTINGS OF SANSETSU AND TSUNENOBU
868-131295-0048 THUS WE RECOGNISE IN ITS WORKS THE SAME IMPULSES WHICH FORMED THE
868-131295-0049 FORMULATED BY THE VARIOUS FLOWER MASTERS OF THIS PERIOD SHOWING AS THEY WOULD THE FUNDAMENTAL THEORIES WHICH GOVERNED TOKUGAWA DECORATION WE FIND THEM REFERRING TO THE LEADING PRINCIPLE HEAVEN THE SUBORDINATE PRINCIPLE EARTH THE RECONCILING PRINCIPLE MAN
868-131295-0050 THE FORMER IS ART IN ITS PROPER SETTING AND APPEALS TO US ON ACCOUNT OF ITS TRUE INTIMACY WITH LIFE WE SHOULD LIKE TO CALL THIS SCHOOL THE NATURAL IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE NATURALESQUE AND FORMALISTIC SCHOOLS
868-131295-0051 IT IS AN ECHO OF DEPARTING WINTER COUPLED WITH THE PROPHECY OF SPRING AGAIN IF YOU GO INTO A NOON TEA ON SOME IRRITATINGLY HOT SUMMER DAY YOU MAY DISCOVER IN THE DARKENED COOLNESS OF THE TOKONOMA A SINGLE LILY IN A HANGING VASE
868-131295-0052 DRIPPING WITH DEW IT SEEMS TO SMILE AT THE FOOLISHNESS OF LIFE A SOLO OF FLOWERS IS INTERESTING BUT IN A CONCERTO WITH PAINTING AND SCULPTURE THE COMBINATION BECOMES ENTRANCING
868-131295-0053 SEKISHIU ONCE PLACED SOME WATER PLANTS IN A FLAT RECEPTACLE TO SUGGEST THE VEGETATION OF LAKES AND MARSHES AND ON THE WALL ABOVE HE HUNG A PAINTING BY SOAMI OF WILD DUCKS FLYING IN THE AIR
868-131295-0054 AND SOME WILD FLOWERS OF THE BEACH ONE OF THE GUESTS HAS RECORDED THAT HE FELT IN THE WHOLE COMPOSITION THE BREATH OF WANING AUTUMN FLOWER STORIES ARE ENDLESS WE SHALL RECOUNT BUT ONE MORE
868-131295-0055 IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THE MORNING GLORY WAS AS YET A RARE PLANT WITH US RIKIU HAD AN ENTIRE GARDEN PLANTED WITH IT WHICH HE CULTIVATED WITH ASSIDUOUS CARE THE FAME OF HIS CONVULVULI REACHED THE EAR OF THE TAIKO
868-131295-0056 AND HE EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE THEM IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH RIKIU INVITED HIM TO A MORNING TEA AT HIS HOUSE
868-131295-0057 THE GROUND HAD BEEN LEVELED AND STREWN WITH FINE PEBBLES AND SAND WITH SULLEN ANGER THE DESPOT ENTERED THE TEA ROOM BUT A SIGHT WAITED HIM THERE WHICH COMPLETELY RESTORED HIS HUMOUR ON THE TOKONOMA IN A RARE BRONZE OF SUNG WORKMANSHIP
868-131295-0058 LAY A SINGLE MORNING GLORY THE QUEEN OF THE WHOLE GARDEN IN SUCH INSTANCES WE SEE THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FLOWER SACRIFICE PERHAPS THE FLOWERS APPRECIATE THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF IT
868-131295-0059 THEY ARE NOT COWARDS LIKE MEN SOME FLOWERS GLORY IN DEATH CERTAINLY THE JAPANESE CHERRY BLOSSOMS DO AS THEY FREELY SURRENDER THEMSELVES TO THE WINDS ANYONE WHO HAS STOOD BEFORE THE FRAGRANT AVALANCHE AT YOSHINO OR ARASHIYAMA MUST HAVE REALIZED THIS
