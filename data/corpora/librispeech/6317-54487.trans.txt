6317-54487-0000 WITH A VIEW TO STOPPING SERBIAN AGITATION FOR INDEPENDENCE AUSTRIA HUNGARY LAID THE BLAME FOR THIS INCIDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT OF SERBIA AND MADE HUMILIATING DEMANDS ON THAT COUNTRY GERMANY AT ONCE PROPOSED THAT THE ISSUE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS
6317-54487-0001 AN AFFAIR WHICH SHOULD BE SETTLED SOLELY BETWEEN AUSTRIA HUNGARY AND SERBIA MEANING THAT THE SMALL NATION SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF A GREAT POWER RUSSIA REFUSED TO TAKE THIS VIEW GREAT BRITAIN PROPOSED A SETTLEMENT BY MEDIATION GERMANY BACKED UP AUSTRIA TO THE LIMIT
6317-54487-0002 TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES WE WERE PERFECTLY AWARE THAT A POSSIBLE WARLIKE ATTITUDE OF AUSTRIA HUNGARY AGAINST SERBIA MIGHT BRING RUSSIA UPON THE FIELD AND THAT IT MIGHT THEREFORE INVOLVE US IN A WAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR DUTIES AS ALLIES
6317-54487-0003 WE COULD NOT HOWEVER IN THESE VITAL INTERESTS OF AUSTRIA HUNGARY WHICH WERE AT STAKE ADVISE OUR ALLY TO TAKE A YIELDING ATTITUDE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH HIS DIGNITY NOR DENY HIM OUR ASSISTANCE THAT MADE THE WAR INEVITABLE
6317-54487-0004 AND NOTIFIED THE KING OF BELGIUM THAT THEY WERE PREPARING TO VIOLATE THE NEUTRALITY OF HIS REALM ON THEIR WAY TO PARIS ON THE SAME DAY GREAT BRITAIN ANXIOUSLY BESOUGHT BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT PROMISED THE AID OF THE BRITISH NAVY IF GERMAN WARSHIPS MADE HOSTILE DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CHANNEL
6317-54487-0005 THE STORM NOW BROKE IN ALL ITS PITILESS FURY THE STATE OF AMERICAN OPINION ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT WILSON PROMPTLY PROCLAIMED THE NEUTRALITY OF THE UNITED STATES
6317-54487-0006 THE SYMPATHIES OF A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE WITHOUT DOUBT ON THE SIDE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE TO THEM THE INVASION OF THE LITTLE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM AND THE HORRORS THAT ACCOMPANIED GERMAN OCCUPATION WERE ODIOUS IN THE EXTREME MOREOVER
6317-54487-0007 THEY REGARDED THE GERMAN IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT AS AN AUTOCRATIC POWER WIELDED IN THE INTEREST OF AN AMBITIOUS MILITARY PARTY
6317-54487-0008 AND THE CROWN PRINCE WERE THE SYMBOLS OF ROYAL ARROGANCE ON THE OTHER HAND MANY AMERICANS OF GERMAN DESCENT IN MEMORY OF THEIR TIES WITH THE FATHERLAND OPENLY SYMPATHIZED WITH THE CENTRAL POWERS AND MANY AMERICANS OF IRISH DESCENT
6317-54487-0009 RECALLING THEIR LONG AND BITTER STRUGGLE FOR HOME RULE IN IRELAND WOULD HAVE REGARDED BRITISH DEFEAT AS A MERITED REDRESS OF ANCIENT GRIEVANCES EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO AMERICAN OPINION BUT ILL INFORMED ABOUT IT
6317-54487-0010 THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SOON BEGAN SYSTEMATIC EFFORTS TO PRESENT ITS CAUSE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE MOST FAVORABLE LIGHT POSSIBLE DOCTOR BERNHARD DERNBURG THE FORMER COLONIAL SECRETARY OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS SENT TO AMERICA AS A SPECIAL AGENT
6317-54487-0011 FOR MONTHS HE FILLED THE NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND PERIODICALS WITH INTERVIEWS ARTICLES AND NOTES ON THE JUSTICE OF THE TEUTONIC CAUSE FROM A PRESS BUREAU IN NEW YORK FLOWED A STREAM OF PAMPHLETS LEAFLETS AND CARTOONS A MAGAZINE THE FATHERLAND
6317-54487-0012 WAS FOUNDED TO SECURE FAIR PLAY FOR GERMANY AND AUSTRIA SEVERAL PROFESSORS IN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES WHO HAD RECEIVED THEIR TRAINING IN GERMANY TOOK UP THE PEN IN DEFENSE OF THE CENTRAL EMPIRES THE GERMAN LANGUAGE PRESS WITHOUT EXCEPTION IT SEEMS
6317-54487-0013 TO THE SPOKESMEN FOR ALL THE CONTENDING POWERS OF EUROPE BEFORE TWO WEEKS HAD ELAPSED THE CONTROVERSY HAD BECOME SO INTENSE THAT PRESIDENT WILSON AUGUST EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN WAS MOVED TO CAUTION HIS COUNTRYMEN AGAINST FALLING INTO ANGRY DISPUTES
6317-54487-0014 EVERY MAN HE SAID WHO REALLY LOVES AMERICA WILL ACT AND SPEAK IN THE TRUE SPIRIT OF NEUTRALITY WHICH IS THE SPIRIT OF IMPARTIALITY AND FAIRNESS AND FRIENDLINESS TO ALL CONCERNED WE MUST BE IMPARTIAL IN THOUGHT AS WELL AS IN ACTION
6317-54487-0015 MUST PUT A CURB UPON OUR SENTIMENTS AS WELL AS UPON EVERY TRANSACTION THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS A PREFERENCE OF ONE PARTY TO THE STRUGGLE BEFORE ANOTHER THE CLASH OVER AMERICAN TRADE AS IN THE TIME OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS
6317-54487-0016 THE CONFLICT IN EUROPE RAISED FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS RESPECTING RIGHTS OF AMERICANS TRADING WITH COUNTRIES AT PEACE AS WELL AS THOSE AT WAR ON THIS POINT THERE EXISTED ON AUGUST FIRST NINETEEN FOURTEEN A FAIRLY DEFINITE BODY OF PRINCIPLES BY WHICH NATIONS WERE BOUND
6317-54487-0017 AMONG THEM THE FOLLOWING WERE OF VITAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT AN ENEMY MERCHANT SHIP CAUGHT ON THE HIGH SEAS WAS A LEGITIMATE PRIZE OF WAR WHICH MIGHT BE SEIZED AND CONFISCATED
6317-54487-0018 IN THE SECOND PLACE IT WAS AGREED THAT CONTRABAND OF WAR FOUND ON AN ENEMY OR NEUTRAL SHIP WAS A LAWFUL PRIZE ANY SHIP SUSPECTED OF CARRYING IT WAS LIABLE TO SEARCH AND IF CAUGHT WITH FORBIDDEN GOODS WAS SUBJECT TO SEIZURE IN THE THIRD PLACE
6317-54487-0019 INTERNATIONAL LAW PRESCRIBED THAT A PEACEFUL MERCHANT SHIP WHETHER BELONGING TO AN ENEMY OR TO A NEUTRAL COUNTRY SHOULD NOT BE DESTROYED OR SUNK WITHOUT PROVISION FOR THE SAFETY OF CREW AND PASSENGERS IN THE FOURTH PLACE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT A BELLIGERENT HAD THE RIGHT
6317-54487-0020 IF IT COULD TO BLOCKADE THE PORTS OF AN ENEMY AND PREVENT THE INGRESS AND EGRESS OF ALL SHIPS BUT SUCH A BLOCKADE TO BE LAWFUL HAD TO BE EFFECTIVE THESE GENERAL PRINCIPLES LEFT UNDETERMINED TWO IMPORTANT MATTERS WHAT IS AN EFFECTIVE BLOCKADE
6317-54487-0021 AND WHAT IS CONTRABAND OF WAR THE TASK OF ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS FELL TO GREAT BRITAIN AS MISTRESS OF THE SEAS ALTHOUGH THE GERMAN SUBMARINES MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER BATTLESHIPS TO MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS PATROL OF THE WATERS IN FRONT OF BLOCKADED PORTS
6317-54487-0022 SHE DECLARED THE BLOCKADE TO BE NONE THE LESS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE HER NAVY WAS SUPREME AS TO CONTRABAND OF WAR GREAT BRITAIN PUT SUCH A BROAD INTERPRETATION UPON THE TERM AS TO INCLUDE NEARLY EVERY IMPORTANT ARTICLE OF COMMERCE
6317-54487-0023 EARLY IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN SHE DECLARED EVEN CARGOES OF GRAIN AND FLOUR TO BE CONTRABAND DEFENDING THE ACTION ON THE GROUND THAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAD RECENTLY TAKEN POSSESSION OF ALL DOMESTIC STOCKS OF CORN WHEAT AND FLOUR
6317-54487-0024 A NEW QUESTION AROSE IN CONNECTION WITH AMERICAN TRADE WITH THE NEUTRAL COUNTRIES SURROUNDING GERMANY GREAT BRITAIN EARLY BEGAN TO INTERCEPT SHIPS CARRYING OIL GASOLINE AND COPPER ALL WAR MATERIALS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE
6317-54487-0025 ON THE GROUND THAT THEY EITHER WERE DESTINED ULTIMATELY TO GERMANY OR WOULD RELEASE GOODS FOR SALE TO GERMANS ON NOVEMBER SECOND NINETEEN FOURTEEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE GERMANS WORE SOWING MINES IN OPEN WATERS AND THAT THEREFORE THE WHOLE OF THE NORTH SEA WAS A MILITARY ZONE
6317-54487-0026 SHIPS BOUND FOR DENMARK NORWAY AND SWEDEN WERE ORDERED TO COME BY THE ENGLISH CHANNEL FOR INSPECTION AND SAILING DIRECTIONS IN EFFECT AMERICANS WERE NOW LICENSED BY GREAT BRITAIN TO TRADE IN CERTAIN COMMODITIES AND IN CERTAIN AMOUNTS WITH NEUTRAL COUNTRIES
6317-54487-0027 AGAINST THESE EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES THE STATE DEPARTMENT AT WASHINGTON LODGED POINTED OBJECTIONS SAYING THIS GOVERNMENT IS RELUCTANTLY FORCED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PRESENT POLICY OF HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT TOWARD NEUTRAL SHIPS AND CARGOES
6317-54487-0028 EXCEEDS THE MANIFEST NECESSITY OF A BELLIGERENT AND CONSTITUTES RESTRICTIONS UPON THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS ON THE HIGH SEAS WHICH ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW OR REQUIRED UNDER THE PRINCIPLE OF SELF PRESERVATION
6317-54487-0029 GERMANY BEGINS THE SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN GERMANY NOW ANNOUNCED THAT ON AND AFTER FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE WHOLE OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AND THE WATERS AROUND GREAT BRITAIN WOULD BE DEEMED A WAR ZONE
6317-54487-0030 THE GERMAN DECREE ADDED THAT AS THE BRITISH ADMIRALTY HAD ORDERED THE USE OF NEUTRAL FLAGS BY ENGLISH SHIPS IN TIME OF DISTRESS NEUTRAL VESSELS WOULD BE IN DANGER OF DESTRUCTION IF FOUND IN THE FORBIDDEN AREA
6317-54487-0031 IT WAS CLEAR THAT GERMANY INTENDED TO EMPLOY SUBMARINES TO DESTROY SHIPPING A NEW FACTOR WAS THUS INTRODUCED INTO NAVAL WARFARE ONE NOT PROVIDED FOR IN THE ACCEPTED LAWS OF WAR
6317-54487-0032 A WARSHIP OVERHAULING A MERCHANT VESSEL COULD EASILY TAKE ITS CREW AND PASSENGERS ON BOARD FOR SAFE KEEPING AS PRESCRIBED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT A SUBMARINE ORDINARILY COULD DO NOTHING OF THE SORT OF NECESSITY THE LIVES AND THE SHIPS OF NEUTRALS AS WELL AS OF BELLIGERENTS
6317-54487-0033 WERE PUT IN MORTAL PERIL THIS AMAZING CONDUCT GERMANY JUSTIFIED ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS MERE RETALIATION AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN FOR HER VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THE RESPONSE OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE OMINOUS GERMAN ORDER WAS SWIFT AND DIRECT
6317-54487-0034 ON FEBRUARY TENTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN IT WARNED GERMANY THAT IF HER COMMANDERS DESTROYED AMERICAN LIVES AND SHIPS IN OBEDIENCE TO THAT DECREE THE ACTION WOULD BE VERY HARD INDEED TO RECONCILE WITH THE FRIENDLY RELATIONS HAPPILY SUBSISTING BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS
6317-54487-0035 THE AMERICAN NOTE ADDED THAT THE GERMAN IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE HELD TO STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALL NECESSARY STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD AMERICAN LIVES AND AMERICAN RIGHTS THIS WAS FIRM AND CLEAR LANGUAGE BUT THE ONLY RESPONSE WHICH IT EVOKED FROM GERMANY
6317-54487-0036 WAS A SUGGESTION THAT IF GREAT BRITAIN WOULD ALLOW FOOD SUPPLIES TO PASS THROUGH THE BLOCKADE THE SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN WOULD BE DROPPED VIOLATIONS OF AMERICAN RIGHTS MEANWHILE GERMANY CONTINUED TO RAVAGE SHIPPING ON THE HIGH SEAS
6317-54487-0037 ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH A GERMAN RAIDER SANK THE AMERICAN SHIP WILLIAM P FRYE IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC ON MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH A BRITISH SHIP THE FALABA WAS SUNK BY A SUBMARINE AND MANY ON BOARD INCLUDING AN AMERICAN CITIZEN
6317-54487-0038 WERE KILLED AND ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH A GERMAN AIRPLANE DROPPED BOMBS ON THE AMERICAN STEAMER CUSHING ON THE MORNING OF MAY FIRST NINETEEN FIFTEEN AMERICANS WERE ASTOUNDED TO SEE IN THE NEWSPAPERS AN ADVERTISEMENT SIGNED BY THE GERMAN IMPERIAL EMBASSY
6317-54487-0039 WARNING TRAVELERS OF THE DANGERS IN THE WAR ZONE AND NOTIFYING THEM THAT ANY WHO VENTURED ON BRITISH SHIPS INTO THAT AREA DID SO AT THEIR OWN RISK ON THAT DAY THE LUSITANIA A BRITISH STEAMER
6317-54487-0040 THE SHIP WAS STRUCK BY TWO TORPEDOES AND IN A FEW MINUTES WENT DOWN BY THE BOW
6317-54487-0041 INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN AMERICAN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN A CRY OF HORROR RAN THROUGH THE COUNTRY
6317-54487-0042 THE LUSITANIA NOTES ON MAY FOURTEENTH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AT WASHINGTON MADE PUBLIC THE FIRST OF THREE FAMOUS NOTES ON THE LUSITANIA CASE IT SOLEMNLY INFORMED THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT THAT NO WARNING THAT AN UNLAWFUL AND INHUMANE ACT WILL BE COMMITTED
6317-54487-0043 CAN POSSIBLY BE ACCEPTED AS AN EXCUSE OR PALLIATION FOR THAT ACT OR AS AN ABATEMENT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS COMMISSION IT CALLED UPON THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT TO DISAVOW THE ACT MAKE REPARATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT
6317-54487-0044 THE RECURRENCE OF ANYTHING SO OBVIOUSLY SUBVERSIVE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF WARFARE THE NOTE CLOSED WITH A CLEAR CAUTION TO GERMANY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD NOT OMIT ANY WORD OR ANY ACT NECESSARY TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS SACRED DUTY
6317-54487-0045 OF MAINTAINING THE RIGHTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND ITS CITIZENS AND OF SAFEGUARDING THEIR FREE EXERCISE AND ENJOYMENT THE DIE WAS CAST BUT GERMANY IN REPLY MERELY TEMPORIZED IN A SECOND NOTE MADE PUBLIC ON JUNE ELEVENTH
6317-54487-0046 PRESIDENT WILSON MADE IT CLEAR TO GERMANY THAT HE MEANT WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE WROTE THAT HE WOULD MAINTAIN THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS FINALLY AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION AND SHIFTING ABOUT THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR ON SEPTEMBER FIRST NINETEEN FIFTEEN
6317-54487-0047 IT IS A TRIUMPH NOT ONLY OF DIPLOMACY BUT OF REASON OF HUMANITY OF JUSTICE AND OF TRUTH THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAW IN IT A RECOGNITION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES FOR WHICH WE HAVE CONTENDED
6317-54487-0048 ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO DEPEND UPON THE ACTION OF THE PROGRESSIVES IF THE BREACH CREATED IN NINETEEN TWELVE COULD BE CLOSED VICTORY WAS POSSIBLE IF NOT DEFEAT WAS CERTAIN
6317-54487-0049 A PROMISE OF UNITY LAY IN THE FACT THAT THE CONVENTIONS OF THE REPUBLICANS AND PROGRESSIVES WERE HELD SIMULTANEOUSLY IN CHICAGO THE FRIENDS OF ROOSEVELT HOPED THAT BOTH PARTIES WOULD SELECT HIM AS THEIR CANDIDATE BUT THIS HOPE WAS NOT REALIZED
6317-54487-0050 THE REPUBLICANS CHOSE AND THE PROGRESSIVES ACCEPTED CHARLES E HUGHES AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT WHO AS GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK HAD WON A NATIONAL REPUTATION BY WAGING WAR ON MACHINE POLITICIANS
6317-54487-0051 IN THE FACE OF THE CLAMOR FOR EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY WITH ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE CONTENDING POWERS OF EUROPE THE REPUBLICANS CHOSE A MIDDLE COURSE DECLARING THAT THEY WOULD UPHOLD ALL AMERICAN RIGHTS AT HOME AND ABROAD BY LAND AND BY SEA
6317-54487-0052 THIS SENTIMENT MISTER HUGHES ECHOED IN HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY SOME IT WAS INTERPRETED TO MEAN A FIRMER POLICY IN DEALING WITH GREAT BRITAIN BY OTHERS A MORE VIGOROUS HANDLING OF THE SUBMARINE MENACE THE DEMOCRATS ON THEIR SIDE
6317-54487-0053 RENOMINATED PRESIDENT WILSON BY ACCLAMATION REVIEWED WITH PRIDE THE LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PARTY AND COMMENDED THE SPLENDID DIPLOMATIC VICTORIES OF OUR GREAT PRESIDENT WHO HAS PRESERVED THE VITAL INTERESTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS CITIZENS AND KEPT US OUT OF WAR
6317-54487-0054 IN THE ELECTION WHICH ENSUED PRESIDENT WILSON'S POPULAR VOTE EXCEEDED THAT CAST FOR MISTER HUGHES BY MORE THAN HALF A MILLION WHILE HIS ELECTORAL VOTE STOOD TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR
6317-54487-0055 THE RESULT WAS REGARDED AND NOT WITHOUT WARRANT AS A GREAT PERSONAL TRIUMPH FOR THE PRESIDENT HE HAD RECEIVED THE LARGEST VOTE YET CAST FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY PRACTICALLY DISAPPEARED
6317-54487-0056 AND THE SOCIALISTS SUFFERED A SEVERE SET BACK FALLING FAR BEHIND THE VOTE OF NINETEEN TWELVE PRESIDENT WILSON URGES PEACE UPON THE WARRING NATIONS APPARENTLY CONVINCED THAT HIS PACIFIC POLICIES HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY APPROVED BY HIS COUNTRYMEN
6317-54487-0057 PRESIDENT WILSON SOON AFTER THE ELECTION ADDRESSED PEACE NOTES TO THE EUROPEAN BELLIGERENTS ON DECEMBER SIXTEENTH THE GERMAN EMPEROR PROPOSED TO THE ALLIED POWERS THAT THEY ENTER INTO PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
6317-54487-0058 TO THESE NOTES THE CENTRAL POWERS REPLIED THAT THEY WERE READY TO MEET THEIR ANTAGONISTS IN A PEACE CONFERENCE AND ALLIED POWERS ANSWERED BY PRESENTING CERTAIN CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO A SATISFACTORY SETTLEMENT ON JANUARY TWENTY SECOND NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
6317-54487-0059 PRESIDENT WILSON IN AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE SENATE DECLARED IT TO BE A DUTY OF THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE PART IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STABLE PEACE ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRINCIPLES THESE WERE IN SHORT PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY
6317-54487-0060 THE RIGHT OF NATIONALITIES TO FREEDOM AND SELF GOVERNMENT THE INDEPENDENCE OF POLAND FREEDOM OF THE SEAS THE REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS AND THE ABOLITION OF ENTANGLING ALLIANCES THE WHOLE WORLD WAS DISCUSSING THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKABLE MESSAGE
6317-54487-0061 WHEN IT WAS DUMBFOUNDED TO HEAR ON JANUARY THIRTY FIRST THAT THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR AT WASHINGTON HAD ANNOUNCED THE OFFICIAL RENEWAL OF RUTHLESS SUBMARINE WARFARE THE UNITED STATES AT WAR STEPS TOWARD WAR
6317-54487-0062 THREE DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE NEWS THAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO RETURN TO ITS FORMER SUBMARINE POLICY PRESIDENT WILSON SEVERED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE GERMAN EMPIRE AT THE SAME TIME HE EXPLAINED TO CONGRESS THAT HE DESIRED NO CONFLICT WITH GERMANY
6317-54487-0063 AND WOULD AWAIT AN OVERT ACT BEFORE TAKING FURTHER STEPS TO PRESERVE AMERICAN RIGHTS GOD GRANT HE CONCLUDED THAT WE MAY NOT BE CHALLENGED TO DEFEND THEM BY ACTS OF WILLFUL INJUSTICE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GERMANY YET THE CHALLENGE CAME
6317-54487-0064 THE REPLY OF CONGRESS ON APRIL SIXTH WAS A RESOLUTION PASSED WITH ONLY A FEW DISSENTING VOTES DECLARING THE EXISTENCE OF A STATE OF WAR WITH GERMANY AUSTRIA HUNGARY AT ONCE SEVERED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL DECEMBER SEVENTH THAT CONGRESS
6317-54487-0065 ACTING ON THE PRESIDENT'S ADVICE DECLARED WAR ALSO ON THAT VASSAL OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT AMERICAN WAR AIMS IN MANY ADDRESSES AT THE BEGINNING AND DURING THE COURSE OF THE WAR PRESIDENT WILSON STATED THE PURPOSES WHICH ACTUATED OUR GOVERNMENT IN TAKING UP ARMS
6317-54487-0066 HE FIRST MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT WAS A WAR OF SELF DEFENSE THE MILITARY MASTERS OF GERMANY HE EXCLAIMED DENIED US THE RIGHT TO BE NEUTRAL PROOF OF THAT LAY ON EVERY HAND AGENTS OF THE GERMAN IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT HAD DESTROYED AMERICAN LIVES AND AMERICAN PROPERTY ON THE HIGH SEAS
