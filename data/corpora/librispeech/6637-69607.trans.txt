6637-69607-0000 AS THE TALL SLIM SOLDIER PAID HIS RESPECTS TO LADY HENRY AND WITH A SMILING WORD OR TWO TO THE REST OF THOSE PRESENT TOOK HIS PLACE BESIDE HER IN THE CIRCLE WELL HAVE YOU COME FOR YOUR LETTERS
6637-69607-0001 I THINK I CAME FOR CONVERSATION WAS WARKWORTH'S LAUGHING REPLY AS HE LOOKED FIRST AT HIS HOSTESS AND THEN AT THE CIRCLE
6637-69607-0002 COME AND CONSOLE ME TELL ME WHAT NEW FOLLIES THE DUCHESS HAS ON FOOT
6637-69607-0003 THE GREAT MAN PLUNGED INTO A LIVELY CONVERSATION WITH HER SIR WILFRID WARKWORTH AND A FEW OTHER HABITUES ENDEAVORED MEANWHILE TO AMUSE LADY HENRY BUT IT WAS NOT EASY
6637-69607-0004 HER BROW WAS LOWERING HER TALK FORCED THROUGHOUT SIR WILFRID PERCEIVED IN HER A STRAINED ATTENTION DIRECTED TOWARDS THE CONVERSATION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM SHE COULD NEITHER SEE IT
6637-69607-0005 NOR HEAR IT BUT SHE WAS JEALOUSLY CONSCIOUS OF IT
6637-69607-0006 THERE WAS NO DOUBT AN ELEMENT OF MALICE IN THE COURT HE WAS NOW PAYING TO MADEMOISELLE JULIE LADY HENRY HAD BEEN THORNY OVER MUCH DURING THE AFTERNOON EVEN FOR HER OLDEST FRIEND SHE HAD PASSED BOUNDS
6637-69607-0007 HE DESIRED PERHAPS TO BRING IT HOME TO HER MEANWHILE JULIE LE BRETON AFTER A FIRST MOMENT OF RESERVE AND DEPRESSION HAD BEEN BEGUILED CARRIED AWAY
6637-69607-0008 FOUND HIMSELF FLOATING ON A STREAM OF TALK WHICH JULIE LED FIRST INTO ONE CHANNEL AND THEN INTO ANOTHER AS SHE PLEASED AND ALL TO THE FLATTERY AND GLORIFICATION OF THE TALKER
6637-69607-0009 NO DOUBT BUT WILFRID BURY UNEASILY AWARE EVERY NOW AND THEN
6637-69607-0010 OF THIS SLOW DISCROWNING AND WAS INCLINED ONCE MORE RATHER TO BE SORRY FOR THE OLDER WOMAN THAN TO ADMIRE THE YOUNGER AT LAST LADY HENRY COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
6637-69607-0011 MADEMOISELLE BE SO GOOD AS TO RETURN HIS FATHER'S LETTERS TO CAPTAIN WARKWORTH SHE SAID ABRUPTLY IN HER COLDEST VOICE
6637-69607-0012 HEAD THROWN BACK AND KNEES CROSSED WAS ABOUT TO POUR INTO THE EARS OF HIS COMPANION THE WHOLE CONFIDENTIAL HISTORY OF HIS APPOINTMENT TO OFFICE THREE YEARS BEFORE JULIE LE BRETON ROSE AT ONCE
6637-69607-0013 SHE WENT TOWARDS A TABLE AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGE ROOM AND CAPTAIN WARKWORTH FOLLOWED HER MONTRESOR PERHAPS REPENTING HIMSELF A LITTLE RETURNED TO LADY HENRY
6637-69607-0014 AND THOUGH SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH GREAT COOLNESS THE CIRCLE ROUND HER NOW AUGMENTED BY DOCTOR MEREDITH AND ANOTHER POLITICIAN OR TWO WAS RECONSTITUTED AND PRESENTLY WITH A CONSCIOUS EFFORT
6637-69607-0015 VISIBLE AT LEAST TO BURY SHE EXERTED HERSELF TO HOLD IT AND SUCCEEDED SUDDENLY JUST AS BURY HAD FINISHED A VERY NEAT ANALYSIS OF THE SHAH'S PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CHARACTER
6637-69607-0016 AND WHILE THE APPLAUDING LAUGHTER OF THE GROUP OF INTIMATES AMID WHICH HE SAT TOLD HIM THAT HIS EPIGRAMS HAD BEEN GOOD HE HAPPENED TO RAISE HIS EYES TOWARDS THE DISTANT SETTEE WHERE JULIE LE BRETON WAS SITTING
6637-69607-0017 HIS SMILE STIFFENED ON HIS LIPS LIKE AN ICY WAVE A SWIFT AND TRAGIC IMPRESSION SWEPT THROUGH HIM HE TURNED AWAY ASHAMED OF HAVING SEEN AND HID HIMSELF AS IT WERE
6637-69607-0018 ON WHICH SAT LADY HENRY'S COMPANION HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HIS HANDSOME HEAD BENT TOWARDS HER THEY HAD BEEN TALKING EARNESTLY WHOLLY FORGETTING AND APPARENTLY FORGOTTEN BY THE REST OF THE ROOM
6637-69607-0019 ON HIS SIDE THERE WAS AN AIR OF EMBARRASSMENT HE SEEMED TO BE CHOOSING HIS WORDS WITH DIFFICULTY HIS EYES ON THE FLOOR JULIE LE BRETON ON THE CONTRARY WAS LOOKING AT HIM
6637-69607-0020 LOOKING WITH ALL HER SOUL HER ARDENT UNHAPPY SOUL UNCONSCIOUS OF AUGHT ELSE IN THE WIDE WORLD GOOD GOD SHE IS IN LOVE WITH HIM

6637-69607-0023 THE ACCENT WAS INDESCRIBABLE AND WITH A FIERCE HAND SHE ARRANGED THE FOLDS OF HER OWN THICK SILK DRESS AS THOUGH FOR SOME RELIEF TO THE STORMY FEELING WITHIN SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE TORN THAN SMOOTHED IT
6637-69607-0024 SIR WILFRID SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HER KNEES CROSSED FINGER TIPS LIGHTLY TOUCHING THE FAIR EYELASHES SOMEWHAT LOWERED CALM BESIDE TEMPEST
6637-69607-0025 TO EVELYN CROWBOROUGH'S BAZAAR AND ASKED WHAT SHE WAS TO DO I TOLD HER OF COURSE THAT I WOULD PUT UP WITH NOTHING OF THE KIND

6637-69607-0029 SHE OFFERED ME HER VALUABLE SERVICES FOR ALL SORTS OF SUPERFLUOUS THINGS THAT I DIDN'T WANT IF ONLY I WOULD SPARE HER JULIE FOR THIS RIDICULOUS BAZAAR SO THEN MY BACK WAS PUT UP AGAIN
6637-69607-0030 THAT ALONE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY ME IN DISMISSING HER

6637-69607-0044 AND LADY HENRY LIFTED HERSELF IN HER CHAIR A PALE AND QUIVERING IMAGE OF WAR
6637-69607-0045 THAT HER CHARACTER IS SUCH THAT SHE FORCES COMPARISONS BETWEEN US BETWEEN HER AND ME THAT SHE PUSHES HERSELF INTO A PROMINENCE THAT IS INTOLERABLE CONSIDERING WHO AND WHAT SHE IS
