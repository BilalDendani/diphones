6330-62851-0000 ART FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE ALL EDITORS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS IN ONE GROUP ARE THOSE WHO THINK THAT ANYBODY WHO CAN MAKE A GOOD BOMB CAN UNDOUBTEDLY FASHION A GREAT SONNET
6330-62851-0001 THE MEMBERS OF THE OTHER CLASS BELIEVE THAT IF A MAN LOVES HIS COUNTRY HE IS NECESSARILY WELL FITTED TO BE A BOOK REVIEWER AS A MATTER OF FACT NEW TERMINOLOGY IS COMING INTO THE BUSINESS OF CRITICISM
6330-62851-0002 A FEW YEARS AGO THE CRITIC WHO WAS DISPLEASED WITH A BOOK CALLED IT SENSATIONAL OR SENTIMENTAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO DAY HE WOULD VOICE HIS DISAPPROVAL BY WRITING
6330-62851-0003 PRO GERMAN OR BOLSHEVIST AUTHORS ARE NO LONGER EVALUATED IN TERMS OF AESTHETICS BUT RATHER FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
6330-62851-0004 INDEED TO DAY WE HAVE HARDLY SUCH A THING AS GOOD WRITERS AND BAD WRITERS THEY HAVE BECOME INSTEAD EITHER SOUND OR DANGEROUS A SOUND AUTHOR IS ONE WITH WHOSE VIEWS YOU ARE IN AGREEMENT
6330-62851-0005 SO TIGHTLY ARE THE LINES DRAWN THAT THE CRITICISM OF THE LEADING MEMBERS OF EACH SIDE CAN BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED IN ADVANCE SHOW ME THE COVER OF A WAR NOVEL AND LET ME OBSERVE THAT IT IS CALLED THE GREAT FOLLY
6330-62851-0006 AND I WILL GUARANTEE TO FORESHADOW WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY JUST WHAT THE CRITIC OF THE NEW YORK TIMES WILL SAY ABOUT IT AND ALSO THE CRITIC OF THE LIBERATOR EVEN IF IT HAPPENED TO BE CALLED THE GLORY OF SHRAPNEL
6330-62851-0007 THE GUESSING WOULD BE JUST AS EASY THE MANNER IN WHICH ANYBODY SAYS ANYTHING NOW WHETHER IN PROSE VERSE MUSIC OR PAINTING IS ENTIRELY SECONDARY IN THE MINDS OF ALL CRITICAL PUBLICATIONS
6330-62851-0008 REVIEWERS LOOK FOR MOTIVES SYMPHONIES ARE DISMISSED AS SEDITIOUS AND LYRICS ARE CLOSELY SCANNED TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR RHYTHMS ARE CALCULATED TO UPSET THE ESTABLISHED ORDER WITHOUT DUE RECOURSE TO THE BALLOT
6330-62851-0009 NOR HAS THIS PARTICULAR REVIEWER ANY INTENTION OF SUGGESTING THAT SUCH ACTIVITY IS ENTIRELY VAIN AND FANCIFUL HE REMEMBERS THAT ONLY A MONTH AGO HE BEGAN A THRILLING ADVENTURE STORY CALLED
6330-62851-0010 A VIVID NOVEL ABOUT THE WAR BY JOHN DOS PASSOS HAS BEEN ISSUED UNDER THE TITLE THREE SOLDIERS
6330-62851-0011 ONE OF THE CHIEF CHARACTERS WAS A CREATIVE MUSICIAN WHO BROKE UNDER THE RIGOR OF ARMY DISCIPLINE WHICH WAS REPUGNANT TO HIM
6330-62851-0012 NOBODY WHO WROTE ABOUT THE BOOK UNDERTOOK TO DISCUSS WHETHER OR NOT THE AUTHOR HAD PAINTED A PERSUASIVE PICTURE OF THE STRUGGLE IN THE SOUL OF A CREDIBLE MAN INSTEAD
6330-62851-0013 THEY ARGUED AS TO JUST WHAT PROPORTION OF MEN IN THE AMERICAN ARMY WERE DISCONTENTED AND THE FINAL CRITICAL VERDICT IS BEING WITHHELD UNTIL STATISTICS ARE AVAILABLE AS TO HOW MANY OF THEM WERE MUSICIANS
6330-62851-0014 THOSE WHO DISLIKED THE BOOK DID NOT SPEAK OF MISTER DOS PASSOS AS EITHER A REALIST OR A ROMANTICIST THEY SIMPLY CALLED HIM A TRAITOR AND LET IT GO AT THAT THE ENTHUSIASTS
6330-62851-0015 SPEAKING AS A NATIVE BORN AMERICAN BROOKLYN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHO ONCE VOTED FOR A SOCIALIST FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE BOARD OF ALDERMEN
6330-62851-0016 AGAIN AND AGAIN HE HAS FOUND IN THE LIBERATOR AND ELSEWHERE ABLE YOUNG MEN WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER PRAISING NOVELS FOR NO REASON ON EARTH EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE RADICAL
6330-62851-0017 IF THE NOVELIST SAID THAT LIFE IN A MIDDLEWESTERN TOWN WAS DREARY AND EVIL HE WAS BOUND TO BE PRAISED BY THE SOCIALIST REVIEWERS
6330-62851-0018 ON THE OTHER HAND ANY AUTHOR WHO FOUND IN THIS SAME MIDDLE WEST A COMMUNITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL NOT HOPELESSLY STUNTED IN MIND AND IN MORALS
6330-62851-0019 THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE RADICAL CRITICS EXTENDS NOT ONLY TO REBELS AGAINST EXISTING GOVERNMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND MORAL CONVENTIONS BUT TO ALL THOSE WHO DARE TO WRITE IN ANY NEW MANNER
6330-62851-0020 NOVELS WHICH BEGIN IN THE MIDDLE AND WORK FIRST FORWARD AND THEN BACK WIN FAVOR AS BLOWS AGAINST THE BOURGEOIS IDEA THAT A STRAIGHT LINE IS THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS
6330-62851-0021 OF COURSE THE RADICAL AUTHOR CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING THE CONSERVATIVE DOES AND STILL RETAIN THE ADMIRATION OF HIS FELLOWS BY DINT OF A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF TACT
6330-62851-0022 RHAPSODIES ON LOVE WILL BE DAMNED AS SENTIMENTAL IF THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN INJUDICIOUS ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIS CHARACTERS TO MARRY BUT HE CAN RETAIN EXACTLY THE SAME LANGUAGE IF HE IS CAREFUL TO ADD A FOOTNOTE THAT NOTHING IS CONTEMPLATED EXCEPT THE FREEST OF FREE UNIONS
6330-62851-0023 A FEW WORKS ARE PRAISED BY BOTH SIDES BECAUSE EACH FINDS A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION FOR THE SAME SET OF FACTS THUS THE AUTHORS OF DULCY
6330-62851-0024 WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THEMSELVES WARMLY GREETED IN ONE OF THE SOCIALIST DAILIES AS YOUNG MEN WHO HAD STRUCK A BLOW FOR GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF ALL ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES MERELY BECAUSE THEY HAD INTRODUCED A BIG BUSINESS MAN INTO THEIR PLAY
6330-62851-0025 AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF COMIC RELIEF HAD MADE HIM A FOOL
6330-62851-0026 THE RECENT BATTLE OF THE CENTURY EVENTUALLY SIMMERED DOWN INTO THE MINDS OF MANY AS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE FORCES OF REACTION AND REVOLUTION
6330-62851-0027 IT WAS KNOWN BEFORE THE FIGHT THAT CARPENTIER WOULD WEAR A FLOWERED SILK BATHROBE INTO THE RING WHILE DEMPSEY WOULD BE CLAD IN AN OLD RED SWEATER HOW COULD SYMBOLISM BE MORE PERFECT
6330-62851-0028 ANYBODY WHO BELIEVED THAT CARPENTIER'S RIGHT WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN WAS IMMEDIATELY SET DOWN AS A PROFITEER IN MUNITIONS WHO WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY WELCOME THE OUTBREAK OF ANOTHER WAR
6330-62851-0029 LIKEWISE IT WAS UNSAFE TO EXPRESS THE OPINION THAT DEMPSEY'S INFIGHTING MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR THE FRENCHMAN LEST ONE BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE LITTLE WILLFUL GROUP OF PACIFISTS WHO IMPEDED THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
6330-62851-0030 IT WAS GENERALLY FELT BY HIS SUPPORTERS THAT THE EIGHT HOUR DAY WAS SAFE AND THAT THE OPEN SHOP WOULD NEVER BE GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN AMERICA
6330-62851-0031 THE ONLY ENCOURAGING FEATURE IN THE INCREASINGLY SHARP FEELING OF CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS AMONG CRITICS IS A GROWING FRANKNESS
6330-62851-0032 BECAUSE HE SPEAKS ILL OF CONSCRIPTION AND THEY BELIEVE IN IT
6330-62851-0033 ONE OF THE FRANKEST WRITING MEN WE EVER MET IS THE EDITOR OF A SOCIALIST NEWSPAPER WHENEVER THERE'S A BIG STRIKE HE EXPLAINED TO ME I ALWAYS TELL THE MAN WHO GOES OUT ON THE STORY
6330-62851-0034 NEVER SEE A STRIKER HIT A SCAB ALWAYS SEE THE SCAB HIT THE STRIKER YOU SEE HE WENT ON THERE ARE SEVEN OR EIGHT OTHER NEWSPAPERS IN TOWN WHO WILL SEE IT JUST THE OTHER WAY
6330-62851-0035 AND I'VE GOT TO KEEP THE BALANCE STRAIGHT THERE USED TO BE A PRACTICE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THIS AMONG BASEBALL UMPIRES
6330-62851-0036 THAT IS NOT AMONG UMPIRES
6330-62851-0037 THE RADICAL EDITOR WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ABASHED WHEN I QUOTED TO HIM THE REMARK OF A MAN WHO SAID THAT HE ALWAYS READ HIS PAPER WITH GREAT INTEREST BECAUSE HE INVARIABLY FOUND THE EDITORIAL OPINIONS IN THE NEWS
6330-62851-0038 IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT EVEN THOSE WRITERS WHO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE MORE DELIBERATE THAN THE JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN STRUCK WITH THE IDEA THAT BY WORDS THEY CAN SHAPE THE WORLD A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE HEART'S DESIRE
6330-62851-0039 THROUGHOUT THE WAR WE WERE TOLD SO CONSTANTLY THAT BATTLES COULD BE DECIDED AND SHIPS BUILT AND WARS DECIDED BY THE FORCE OF PROPAGANDA THAT EVERY MAN WITH A PORTABLE TYPEWRITER IN HIS SUITCASE BEGAN TO THINK OF IT
6330-62851-0040 AS A BATON THERE WAS A DAY WHEN A NOVELIST WAS SATISFIED IF HE COULD CAPTURE A LITTLE SLICE OF LIFE AND GET IT BETWEEN THE COVERS OF HIS BOOK NOW EVERYBODY WRITES TO SHAKE THE WORLD
