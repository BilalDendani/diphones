7720-105168-0000 FOR TWO DAYS TARZAN OF THE APES HAD BEEN HUNTING LEISURELY TO THE NORTH AND SWINGING IN A WIDE CIRCLE HE HAD RETURNED TO WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE CLEARING WHERE HE HAD LEFT BERTHA KIRCHER AND THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT HE HAD SPENT THE NIGHT IN A LARGE TREE THAT OVERHUNG THE RIVER ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CLEARING
7720-105168-0001 AND NOW IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS HE WAS CROUCHING AT THE WATER'S EDGE WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE PISAH THE FISH THINKING THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT BACK WITH HIM TO THE HUT WHERE THE GIRL COULD COOK IT FOR HERSELF AND HER COMPANION MOTIONLESS AS A BRONZE STATUE WAS THE WILY APE MAN
7720-105168-0002 FOR WELL HE KNEW HOW WARY IS PISAH THE FISH THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WOULD FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY AND ONLY BY INFINITE PATIENCE MIGHT HE BE CAPTURED AT ALL TARZAN DEPENDED UPON HIS OWN QUICKNESS AND THE SUDDENNESS OF HIS ATTACK FOR HE HAD NO BAIT OR HOOK
7720-105168-0003 HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAYS OF THE DENIZENS OF THE WATER TOLD HIM WHERE TO WAIT FOR PISAH IT MIGHT BE A MINUTE OR IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR BEFORE THE FISH WOULD SWIM INTO THE LITTLE POOL ABOVE WHICH HE CROUCHED BUT SOONER OR LATER ONE WOULD COME THAT THE APE MAN KNEW
7720-105168-0004 SO WITH THE PATIENCE OF THE BEAST OF PREY HE WAITED FOR HIS QUARRY AT LAST THERE WAS A GLINT OF SHINY SCALES PISAH WAS COMING IN A MOMENT HE WOULD BE WITHIN REACH AND THEN WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHT TWO STRONG BROWN HANDS WOULD PLUNGE INTO THE POOL AND SEIZE HIM BUT
7720-105168-0005 THERE WAS A GREAT CRASHING IN THE UNDERBRUSH BEHIND THE APE MAN INSTANTLY PISAH WAS GONE AND TARZAN GROWLING HAD WHEELED ABOUT TO FACE WHATEVER CREATURE MIGHT BE MENACING HIM THE MOMENT THAT HE TURNED HE SAW THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE DISTURBANCE WAS ZU TAG
7720-105168-0006 WHAT DOES ZU TAG WANT ASKED THE APE MAN ZU TAG COMES TO THE WATER TO DRINK REPLIED THE APE WHERE IS THE TRIBE ASKED TARZAN THEY ARE HUNTING FOR PISANGS AND SCIMATINES FARTHER BACK IN THE FOREST REPLIED ZU TAG AND THE TARMANGANI SHE AND BULL ASKED TARZAN
7720-105168-0007 KUDU HAS COME OUT OF HIS LAIR TWICE SINCE THEY LEFT DID THE TRIBE CHASE THEM AWAY ASKED TARZAN NO REPLIED THE APE WE DID NOT SEE THEM GO WE DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY LEFT TARZAN SWUNG QUICKLY THROUGH THE TREES TOWARD THE CLEARING THE HUT AND BOMA WERE AS HE HAD LEFT THEM
7720-105168-0008 BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF EITHER THE MAN OR THE WOMAN CROSSING THE CLEARING HE ENTERED THE BOMA AND THEN THE HUT BOTH WERE EMPTY AND HIS TRAINED NOSTRILS TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAD BEEN GONE FOR AT LEAST TWO DAYS AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE HUT
7720-105168-0009 AND TAKING IT DOWN HE READ AFTER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT MISS KIRCHER AND KNOWING THAT YOU DISLIKE HER I FEEL THAT IT IS NOT FAIR TO HER AND TO YOU THAT WE SHOULD IMPOSE LONGER UPON YOU I KNOW THAT OUR PRESENCE IS KEEPING YOU FROM CONTINUING YOUR JOURNEY TO THE WEST COAST
7720-105168-0010 AND SO I HAVE DECIDED THAT IT IS BETTER FOR US TO TRY AND REACH THE WHITE SETTLEMENTS IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT IMPOSING FURTHER UPON YOU WE BOTH THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND PROTECTION IF THERE WAS ANY WAY THAT I MIGHT REPAY THE OBLIGATION I FEEL I SHOULD BE ONLY TOO GLAD TO DO SO
7720-105168-0011 THEY WERE GONE AND WOULD FORGET BUT SOMEHOW HE COULD NOT FORGET HE WALKED OUT ACROSS THE BOMA AND INTO THE CLEARING HE FELT UNEASY AND RESTLESS ONCE HE STARTED TOWARD THE NORTH IN RESPONSE TO A SUDDEN DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE HIS WAY TO THE WEST COAST
7720-105168-0012 AND THUS FOLLOWING THE RIVERS HE WOULD BE SURE OF GAME AND WATER IN PLENTY BUT HE DID NOT GO FAR
7720-105168-0013 HE IS AN ENGLISHMAN HE MUTTERED AND THE OTHER IS A WOMAN THEY CAN NEVER REACH THE SETTLEMENTS WITHOUT MY HELP I COULD NOT KILL HER WITH MY OWN HANDS WHEN I TRIED AND IF I LET THEM GO ON ALONE
7720-105168-0014 JUST AS SURELY AS THOUGH I HAD RUN MY KNIFE INTO HER HEART NO AND AGAIN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD TARZAN OF THE APES IS A FOOL
7720-105168-0015 MANU THE MONKEY HAD SEEN THE TWO TARMANGANI PASS TWO DAYS BEFORE CHATTERING AND SCOLDING HE TOLD TARZAN ALL ABOUT IT THEY HAD GONE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VILLAGE OF THE GOMANGANI THAT MUCH HAD MANU SEEN WITH HIS OWN EYES SO THE APE MAN SWUNG ON THROUGH THE JUNGLE IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION
7720-105168-0016 AND THOUGH WITH NO CONCENTRATED EFFORT TO FOLLOW THE SPOOR OF THOSE HE TRAILED HE PASSED NUMEROUS EVIDENCES THAT THEY HAD GONE THIS WAY FAINT SUGGESTIONS OF THEIR SCENT SPOOR CLUNG LIGHTLY TO LEAF OR BRANCH OR BOLE THAT ONE OR THE OTHER HAD TOUCHED OR IN THE EARTH OF THE TRAIL THEIR FEET HAD TROD
7720-105168-0017 AND WHERE THE WAY WOUND THROUGH THE GLOOMY DEPTH OF DANK FOREST THE IMPRESS OF THEIR SHOES STILL SHOWED OCCASIONALLY IN THE DAMP MASS OF DECAYING VEGETATION THAT FLOORED THE WAY AN INEXPLICABLE URGE SPURRED TARZAN TO INCREASING SPEED
7720-105168-0018 THE SAME STILL SMALL VOICE THAT CHIDED HIM FOR HAVING NEGLECTED THEM SEEMED CONSTANTLY WHISPERING THAT THEY WERE IN DIRE NEED OF HIM NOW TARZAN'S CONSCIENCE WAS TROUBLING HIM WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE FACT THAT HE COMPARED HIMSELF TO A WEAK OLD WOMAN FOR THE APE MAN
7720-105168-0019 REARED IN SAVAGERY AND INURED TO HARDSHIPS AND CRUELTY DISLIKED TO ADMIT ANY OF THE GENTLER TRAITS THAT IN REALITY WERE HIS BIRTHRIGHT THE TRAIL MADE A DETOUR TO THE EAST OF THE VILLAGE OF THE WAMABOS AND THEN RETURNED TO THE WIDE ELEPHANT PATH NEARER TO THE RIVER
7720-105168-0020 AT LAST THERE CAME TO THE EARS OF THE APE MAN A PECULIAR WHIRRING THROBBING SOUND FOR AN INSTANT HE PAUSED LISTENING INTENTLY AN AEROPLANE HE MUTTERED AND HASTENED FORWARD AT GREATLY INCREASED SPEED WHEN TARZAN OF THE APES FINALLY REACHED THE EDGE OF THE MEADOWLAND
7720-105168-0021 WHERE SMITH OLDWICK'S PLANE HAD LANDED HE TOOK IN THE ENTIRE SCENE IN ONE QUICK GLANCE AND GRASPED THE SITUATION ALTHOUGH HE COULD SCARCE GIVE CREDENCE TO THE THINGS HE SAW BOUND AND HELPLESS THE ENGLISH OFFICER LAY UPON THE GROUND AT ONE SIDE OF THE MEADOW
7720-105168-0022 WHILE AROUND HIM STOOD A NUMBER OF THE BLACK DESERTERS FROM THE GERMAN COMMAND TARZAN HAD SEEN THESE MEN BEFORE AND KNEW WHO THEY WERE COMING TOWARD HIM DOWN THE MEADOW WAS AN AEROPLANE PILOTED BY THE BLACK USANGA AND IN THE SEAT BEHIND THE PILOT WAS THE WHITE GIRL BERTHA KIRCHER
7720-105168-0023 HIS KNOWLEDGE OF USANGA TOGETHER WITH THE POSITION OF THE WHITE MAN TOLD HIM THAT THE BLACK SERGEANT WAS ATTEMPTING TO CARRY OFF THE WHITE GIRL WHY HE SHOULD BE DOING THIS WHEN HE HAD HER IN HIS POWER AND HAD ALSO CAPTURED AND SECURED THE ONLY CREATURE IN THE JUNGLE WHO MIGHT WISH TO DEFEND HER
7720-105168-0024 IN SO FAR AS THE BLACK COULD KNOW TARZAN COULD NOT GUESS
7720-105168-0025 HIS PRESENT MATE HE DID NOT KNOW THEN THAT USANGA HAD DETERMINED TO FLY AWAY WITH THE WHITE GIRL NEVER TO RETURN
7720-105168-0026 HE HAD TOLD THEM THAT HE WOULD TAKE THE CAPTIVE TO A SULTAN OF THE NORTH AND THERE OBTAIN A GREAT PRICE FOR HER AND THAT WHEN HE RETURNED THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME OF THE SPOILS THESE THINGS TARZAN DID NOT KNOW ALL HE KNEW WAS WHAT HE SAW A NEGRO ATTEMPTING TO FLY AWAY WITH A WHITE GIRL
7720-105168-0027 ALREADY THE MACHINE WAS SLOWLY LEAVING THE GROUND IN A MOMENT MORE IT WOULD RISE SWIFTLY OUT OF REACH AT FIRST TARZAN THOUGHT OF FITTING AN ARROW TO HIS BOW AND SLAYING USANGA BUT AS QUICKLY HE ABANDONED THE IDEA BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THE MOMENT THE PILOT WAS SLAIN THE MACHINE RUNNING WILD
7720-105168-0028 WOULD DASH THE GIRL TO DEATH AMONG THE TREES
7720-105168-0029 AND YET HE DID NOT HESITATE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PUT IT INTO EXECUTION USANGA DID NOT SEE HIM BEING TOO INTENT UPON THE UNACCUSTOMED DUTIES OF A PILOT BUT THE BLACKS ACROSS THE MEADOW SAW HIM
7720-105168-0030 THEY SAW A GIANT WHITE MAN LEAP FROM THE BRANCHES OF A TREE TO THE TURF AND RACE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE PLANE THEY SAW HIM TAKE A LONG GRASS ROPE FROM ABOUT HIS SHOULDERS AS HE RAN THEY SAW THE NOOSE SWINGING IN AN UNDULATING CIRCLE ABOVE HIS HEAD
7720-105168-0031 TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE RUNNING APE MAN SOARED THE HUGE PLANE THE OPEN NOOSE SHOT UP TO MEET IT AND THE GIRL HALF GUESSING THE APE MAN'S INTENTIONS REACHED OUT AND CAUGHT THE NOOSE AND BRACING HERSELF
7720-105168-0032 SIMULTANEOUSLY TARZAN WAS DRAGGED FROM HIS FEET AND THE PLANE LURCHED SIDEWAYS IN RESPONSE TO THE NEW STRAIN USANGA CLUTCHED WILDLY AT THE CONTROL AND THE MACHINE SHOT UPWARD AT A STEEP ANGLE DANGLING AT THE END OF THE ROPE THE APE MAN SWUNG PENDULUM LIKE IN SPACE
7720-105168-0033 THE ENGLISHMAN LYING BOUND UPON THE GROUND HAD BEEN A WITNESS OF ALL THESE HAPPENINGS HIS HEART STOOD STILL AS HE SAW TARZAN'S BODY HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR TOWARD THE TREE TOPS AMONG WHICH IT SEEMED HE MUST INEVITABLY CRASH BUT THE PLANE WAS RISING RAPIDLY
7720-105168-0034 SO THAT THE BEAST MAN CLEARED THE TOP MOST BRANCHES THEN SLOWLY HAND OVER HAND HE CLIMBED TOWARD THE FUSELAGE THE GIRL CLINGING DESPERATELY TO THE NOOSE STRAINED EVERY MUSCLE TO HOLD THE GREAT WEIGHT DANGLING AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROPE USANGA
7720-105168-0035 ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND HIM DROVE THE PLANE HIGHER AND HIGHER INTO THE AIR TARZAN GLANCED DOWNWARD BELOW HIM THE TREE TOPS AND THE RIVER PASSED RAPIDLY TO THE REAR AND ONLY A SLENDER GRASS ROPE
7720-105168-0036 AND THE MUSCLES OF A FRAIL GIRL STOOD BETWEEN HIM AND THE DEATH YAWNING THERE THOUSANDS OF FEET BELOW IT SEEMED TO BERTHA KIRCHER THAT THE FINGERS OF HER HANDS WERE DEAD THE NUMBNESS WAS RUNNING UP HER ARMS TO HER ELBOWS
7720-105168-0037 IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THOSE LIFELESS FINGERS MUST RELAX AT ANY INSTANT AND THEN WHEN SHE HAD ABOUT GIVEN UP HOPE
7720-105168-0038 INSTANTLY THE WEIGHT UPON THE ROPE WAS REMOVED AND A MOMENT LATER TARZAN OF THE APES RAISED HIS BODY ABOVE THE SIDE AND THREW A LEG OVER THE EDGE HE GLANCED FORWARD AT USANGA AND THEN PLACING HIS MOUTH CLOSE TO THE GIRL'S EAR HE CRIED HAVE YOU EVER PILOTED A PLANE
7720-105168-0039 THE GIRL NODDED A QUICK AFFIRMATIVE HAVE YOU THE COURAGE TO CLIMB UP THERE BESIDE THE BLACK AND SEIZE THE CONTROL WHILE I TAKE CARE OF HIM THE GIRL LOOKED TOWARD USANGA AND SHUDDERED YES SHE REPLIED BUT MY FEET ARE BOUND TARZAN DREW HIS HUNTING KNIFE FROM ITS SHEATH AND REACHING DOWN
7720-105168-0040 SEVERED THE THONGS THAT BOUND HER ANKLES THEN THE GIRL UNSNAPPED THE STRAP THAT HELD HER TO HER SEAT WITH ONE HAND TARZAN GRASPED THE GIRL'S ARM AND STEADIED HER AS THE TWO CRAWLED SLOWLY ACROSS THE FEW FEET WHICH INTERVENED BETWEEN THE TWO SEATS
7720-105168-0041 A SINGLE SLIGHT TIP OF THE PLANE WOULD HAVE CAST THEM BOTH INTO ETERNITY
7720-105168-0042 AND YET HE KNEW THAT THAT CHANCE MUST BE TAKEN FOR IN THE BRIEF MOMENTS SINCE HE HAD FIRST SEEN THE PLANE HE HAD REALIZED THAT THE BLACK WAS ALMOST WITHOUT EXPERIENCE AS A PILOT AND THAT DEATH SURELY AWAITED THEM IN ANY EVENT SHOULD THE BLACK SERGEANT REMAIN AT THE CONTROL
7720-105168-0043 THE FIRST INTIMATION USANGA HAD THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL WITH HIM WAS WHEN THE GIRL SLIPPED SUDDENLY TO HIS SIDE AND GRASPED THE CONTROL AND AT THE SAME INSTANT STEEL LIKE FINGERS SEIZED HIS THROAT A BROWN HAND SHOT DOWN WITH A KEEN BLADE AND SEVERED THE STRAP ABOUT HIS WAIST
7720-105168-0044 AND GIANT MUSCLES LIFTED HIM BODILY FROM HIS SEAT USANGA CLAWED THE AIR AND SHRIEKED BUT HE WAS HELPLESS AS A BABE
7720-105168-0045 FOR WITH THE CHANGE OF CONTROL IT HAD TAKEN A SUDDEN DIVE THEY SAW IT RIGHT ITSELF
7720-105168-0046 RETURN IN THEIR DIRECTION BUT IT WAS SO FAR ABOVE THEM AND THE LIGHT OF THE SUN SO STRONG THAT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITHIN THE FUSELAGE BUT PRESENTLY LIEUTENANT SMITH OLDWICK GAVE A GASP OF DISMAY AS HE SAW A HUMAN BODY PLUNGE DOWNWARD FROM THE PLANE
7720-105168-0047 TURNING AND TWISTING IN MID AIR IT FELL WITH EVER INCREASING VELOCITY AND THE ENGLISHMAN HELD HIS BREATH AS THE THING HURTLED TOWARD THEM WITH A MUFFLED THUD IT FLATTENED UPON THE TURF NEAR THE CENTER OF THE MEADOW AND WHEN AT LAST THE ENGLISHMAN COULD GAIN THE COURAGE TO AGAIN TURN HIS EYES UPON IT
7720-105168-0048 HE BREATHED A FERVENT PRAYER OF THANKS
7720-105168-0049 USANGA HAD REAPED HIS REWARD AGAIN AND AGAIN THE PLANE CIRCLED ABOVE THE MEADOW THE BLACKS AT FIRST DISMAYED AT THE DEATH OF THEIR LEADER WERE NOW WORKED TO A FRENZY OF RAGE AND A DETERMINATION TO BE AVENGED
7720-105168-0050 THE GIRL AND THE APE MAN SAW THEM GATHER IN A KNOT ABOUT THE BODY OF THEIR FALLEN CHIEF THEY SAW AS THEY CIRCLED ABOVE THE MEADOW THE BLACK FISTS SHAKEN AT THEM AND THE RIFLES BRANDISHING A MENACE TOWARD THEM TARZAN STILL CLUNG TO THE FUSELAGE DIRECTLY BEHIND THE PILOT'S SEAT
7720-105168-0051 ENGINE AND EXHAUST HE SCREAMED A FEW WORDS OF INSTRUCTION INTO HER EAR AS THE GIRL GRASPED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS WORDS SHE PALED
7720-105168-0052 AND HER EYES SHONE WITH A SUDDEN FIRE OF DETERMINATION AS SHE DROPPED THE PLANE TO WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE GROUND AND AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE MEADOW FROM THE BLACKS AND THEN AT FULL SPEED BORE DOWN UPON THE SAVAGES
7720-105168-0053 IT TOUCHED THE GROUND JUST AS IT STRUCK AMONG THEM AND MOWED THROUGH THEM A VERITABLE JUGGERNAUT OF DESTRUCTION WHEN IT CAME TO REST AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST THE APE MAN LEAPED QUICKLY TO THE GROUND AND RAN TOWARD THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT AND AS HE WENT HE GLANCED AT THE SPOT WHERE THE WARRIORS HAD STOOD
7720-105168-0054 READY TO DEFEND HIMSELF IF NECESSARY BUT THERE WAS NONE THERE TO OPPOSE HIM DEAD AND DYING THEY LAY STREWN FOR FIFTY FEET ALONG THE TURF BY THE TIME TARZAN HAD FREED THE ENGLISHMAN THE GIRL JOINED THEM SHE TRIED TO VOICE HER THANKS TO THE APE MAN BUT HE SILENCED HER WITH A GESTURE
7720-105168-0055 YOU SAVED YOURSELF HE INSISTED FOR HAD YOU BEEN UNABLE TO PILOT THE PLANE I COULD NOT HAVE HELPED YOU AND NOW HE SAID YOU TWO HAVE THE MEANS OF RETURNING TO THE SETTLEMENTS THE DAY IS STILL YOUNG YOU CAN EASILY COVER THE DISTANCE IN A FEW HOURS IF YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT PETROL
7720-105168-0056 HE LOOKED INQUIRINGLY TOWARD THE AVIATOR SMITH OLDWICK NODDED HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY I HAVE PLENTY HE REPLIED
7720-105168-0057 NEITHER OF YOU BELONG IN THE JUNGLE A SLIGHT SMILE TOUCHED HIS LIPS AS HE SPOKE THE GIRL AND THE ENGLISHMAN SMILED TOO THIS JUNGLE IS NO PLACE FOR US AT LEAST SAID SMITH OLDWICK AND IT IS NO PLACE FOR ANY OTHER WHITE MAN WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK TO CIVILIZATION WITH US TARZAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
7720-105168-0058 I PREFER THE JUNGLE HE SAID THE AVIATOR DUG HIS TOE INTO THE GROUND AND STILL LOOKING DOWN BLURTED SOMETHING WHICH HE EVIDENTLY HATED TO SAY IF IT IS A MATTER OF LIVING OLD TOP HE SAID ER MONEY ER YOU KNOW TARZAN LAUGHED NO HE SAID
7720-105168-0059 IT IS NOT THAT I WAS BORN IN THE JUNGLE I HAVE LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN THE JUNGLE AND I SHALL DIE IN THE JUNGLE I DO NOT WISH TO LIVE OR DIE ELSEWHERE THE OTHERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM GO SAID THE APE MAN THE QUICKER YOU GO THE QUICKER YOU WILL REACH SAFETY
7720-105168-0060 THEY WALKED TO THE PLANE TOGETHER SMITH OLDWICK PRESSED THE APE MAN'S HAND AND CLAMBERED INTO THE PILOT'S SEAT GOOD BYE SAID THE GIRL AS SHE EXTENDED HER HAND TO TARZAN BEFORE I GO WON'T YOU TELL ME YOU DON'T HATE ME ANY MORE TARZAN'S FACE CLOUDED
