93-126208-0000 IN SPITE OF SUCH OBSTINACIES AS HE NOW KNEW THEM INHERENTLY TO POSSESS WAS A HERCULEAN PERFORMANCE WHICH GRADUALLY LED HIM ON TO A GREATER INTEREST IN IT THAN IN THE PRESUPPOSED PATENT PROCESS
93-126208-0001 THE MOUNTAIN WEIGHT OF MATERIAL UNDER WHICH THE IDEAS LAY IN THOSE DUSTY VOLUMES CALLED THE CLASSICS PIQUED HIM INTO A DOGGED MOUSELIKE SUBTLETY OF ATTEMPT TO MOVE IT PIECEMEAL
93-126208-0002 HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE TOLERABLE TO HIS CRUSTY MAIDEN AUNT BY ASSISTING HER TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY AND THE BUSINESS OF THE LITTLE COTTAGE BAKERY HAD GROWN IN CONSEQUENCE
93-126208-0003 AN AGED HORSE WITH A HANGING HEAD HAD BEEN PURCHASED FOR EIGHT POUNDS AT A SALE A CREAKING CART WITH A WHITY BROWN TILT OBTAINED FOR A FEW POUNDS MORE AND IN THIS TURN OUT IT BECAME JUDE'S BUSINESS THRICE A WEEK TO CARRY LOAVES OF BREAD TO THE VILLAGERS
93-126208-0004 ITS INTERIOR WAS THE SCENE OF MOST OF JUDE'S EDUCATION BY PRIVATE STUDY AS SOON AS THE HORSE HAD LEARNT THE ROAD AND THE HOUSES AT WHICH HE WAS TO PAUSE AWHILE THE BOY SEATED IN FRONT WOULD SLIP THE REINS OVER HIS ARM INGENIOUSLY FIX OPEN
93-126208-0005 BY MEANS OF A STRAP ATTACHED TO THE TILT THE VOLUME HE WAS READING SPREAD THE DICTIONARY ON HIS KNEES AND PLUNGE INTO THE SIMPLER PASSAGES FROM CAESAR VIRGIL OR HORACE AS THE CASE MIGHT BE IN HIS PURBLIND STUMBLING WAY
93-126208-0006 AND WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF LABOUR THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A TENDER HEARTED PEDAGOGUE SHED TEARS YET SOMEHOW GETTING AT THE MEANING OF WHAT HE READ AND DIVINING RATHER THAN BEHOLDING THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL
93-126208-0007 THE ONLY COPIES HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO LAY HANDS ON WERE OLD DELPHIN EDITIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUPERSEDED AND THEREFORE CHEAP
93-126208-0008 MAY HAVE HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING A SCHOLAR BY THESE ROUGH AND READY MEANS HE WAS IN THE WAY OF GETTING INTO THE GROOVE HE WISHED TO FOLLOW WHILE HE WAS BUSIED WITH THESE ANCIENT PAGES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN THUMBED BY HANDS POSSIBLY IN THE GRAVE
93-126208-0009 HE WAS FREQUENTLY MET IN THE LANES BY PEDESTRIANS AND OTHERS WITHOUT HIS SEEING THEM AND BY DEGREES THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HIS METHOD OF COMBINING WORK AND PLAY SUCH THEY CONSIDERED HIS READING TO BE WHICH
93-126208-0010 THOUGH PROBABLY CONVENIENT ENOUGH TO HIMSELF WAS NOT ALTOGETHER A SAFE PROCEEDING FOR OTHER TRAVELLERS ALONG THE SAME ROADS THERE WERE MURMURS
93-126208-0011 AND INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE CONSTABLE'S DUTY TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT AND TAKE HIM TO THE POLICE COURT AT ALFREDSTON AND GET HIM FINED FOR DANGEROUS PRACTICES ON THE HIGHWAY THE POLICEMAN THEREUPON LAY IN WAIT FOR JUDE AND ONE DAY ACCOSTED HIM AND CAUTIONED HIM
93-126208-0012 AS JUDE HAD TO GET UP AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO HEAT THE OVEN AND MIX AND SET IN THE BREAD THAT HE DISTRIBUTED LATER IN THE DAY HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO BED AT NIGHT IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAYING THE SPONGE SO THAT IF HE COULD NOT READ HIS CLASSICS ON THE HIGHWAYS
93-126208-0013 ON A DAY WHEN FAWLEY WAS GETTING QUITE ADVANCED BEING NOW ABOUT SIXTEEN
93-126208-0014 HE STOPPED THE HORSE ALIGHTED AND GLANCING ROUND TO SEE THAT NOBODY WAS IN SIGHT KNELT DOWN ON THE ROADSIDE BANK WITH OPEN BOOK HE TURNED FIRST TO THE SHINY GODDESS WHO SEEMED TO LOOK SO SOFTLY AND CRITICALLY AT HIS DOINGS
93-126208-0015 THEN TO THE DISAPPEARING LUMINARY ON THE OTHER HAND AS HE BEGAN PHOEBE
93-126208-0016 IT HAD ALL COME OF READING HEATHEN WORKS EXCLUSIVELY THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE CONVINCED HE WAS OF HIS INCONSISTENCY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE COULD BE READING QUITE THE RIGHT BOOKS FOR HIS OBJECT IN LIFE
93-126208-0017 CERTAINLY THERE SEEMED LITTLE HARMONY BETWEEN THIS PAGAN LITERATURE AND THE MEDIAEVAL COLLEGES AT CHRISTMINSTER THAT ECCLESIASTICAL ROMANCE IN STONE
93-126208-0018 ULTIMATELY HE DECIDED THAT IN HIS SHEER LOVE OF READING HE HAD TAKEN UP A WRONG EMOTION FOR A CHRISTIAN YOUNG MAN HE HAD DABBLED IN CLARKE'S HOMER BUT HAD NEVER YET WORKED MUCH AT THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE GREEK THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COPY
93-126208-0019 OBTAINED BY POST FROM A SECOND HAND BOOKSELLER HE ABANDONED THE NOW FAMILIAR IONIC FOR A NEW DIALECT AND FOR A LONG TIME ONWARD LIMITED HIS READING ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE GOSPELS AND EPISTLES IN GRIESBACH'S TEXT
93-126208-0020 AS ANOTHER OUTCOME OF THIS CHANGE OF GROOVE HE VISITED ON SUNDAYS ALL THE CHURCHES WITHIN A WALK AND DECIPHERED THE LATIN INSCRIPTIONS ON FIFTEENTH CENTURY BRASSES AND TOMBS ON ONE OF THESE PILGRIMAGES
93-126208-0021 FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER AN INCOME FROM ANY WORK IN PREPARING THE FIRST WOULD BE TOO MEAGRE FOR MAKING THE SECOND HE FELT A DISTASTE
93-126208-0022 HE INCLINED TO THEY BUILT IN A CITY THEREFORE HE WOULD LEARN TO BUILD HE THOUGHT OF HIS UNKNOWN UNCLE HIS COUSIN SUSANNA'S FATHER AN ECCLESIASTICAL WORKER IN METAL AND SOMEHOW
93-126208-0023 MEDIAEVAL ART IN ANY MATERIAL WAS A TRADE FOR WHICH HE HAD RATHER A FANCY HE COULD NOT GO FAR WRONG IN FOLLOWING HIS UNCLE'S FOOTSTEPS AND ENGAGING HIMSELF AWHILE WITH THE CARCASES THAT CONTAINED THE SCHOLAR SOULS
93-126208-0024 HERE JUDE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING AT LEAST THE RUDIMENTS OF FREESTONE WORKING SOME TIME LATER HE WENT TO A CHURCH BUILDER IN THE SAME PLACE AND UNDER THE ARCHITECT'S DIRECTION BECAME HANDY AT RESTORING THE DILAPIDATED MASONRIES OF SEVERAL VILLAGE CHURCHES ROUND ABOUT
