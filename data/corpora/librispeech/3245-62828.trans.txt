3245-62828-0000 AS MEADE MINNIGERODE HAS ACCOMPLISHED FOR YALE IN THE BIG YEAR GEORGE MORTON MIGHT NEVER HAVE GONE TO ANY COLLEGE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR SYLVIA PLANTER
3245-62828-0001 HE WAS ENAMORED OF HER FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN OLD PLANTER ENGAGED HIM TO ACCOMPANY HIS DAUGHTER ON RIDES BUT HIS ADMIRATION DID NOT BECOME ARTICULATE UNTIL SHE FELL OFF HER HORSE
3245-62828-0002 SHE SEEMS TO HAVE DONE IT EXTREMELY WELL HE SAW HER HORSE REFUSE WRITES MISTER CAMP STRAIGHTENING HIS KNEES AND SLIDING IN THE MARSHY GROUND HE WATCHED SYLVIA
3245-62828-0003 SHOT ACROSS THE HEDGE BUT YOUNG MORTON WAS MUCH TOO INTENT UPON THE FATE OF HIS GODDESS TO HAVE EYES FOR ANYTHING ELSE
3245-62828-0004 AND SO GEORGE DECIDED TO GO TO COLLEGE HIS HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION HAD BEEN SCANT AND IRREGULAR HE WENT TO PRINCETON AND AFTER TWO MONTHS CRAMMING PASSED ALL HIS EXAMINATIONS
3245-62828-0005 FOOTBALL ATTRACTED HIM FROM THE FIRST AS A MEANS TO THE ADVANCEMENT WHICH HE DESIRED WITH SURPRISED EYES WRITES OUR AUTHOR HE SAW ESTATES AS EXTRAVAGANT AS OAKMONT AND FREQUENTLY IN BETTER TASTE
3245-62828-0006 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT SOME DAY HE WOULD ENTER THOSE PLACES AS A GUEST BOWED TO BY SUCH SERVANTS AS HE HAD BEEN IT WAS POSSIBLE HE PROMISED HIMSELF BRAVELY
3245-62828-0007 IF ONLY HE COULD WIN A YALE OR A HARVARD GAME PERHAPS THIS EXPLAINS WHY ONE MEETS SO FEW PRINCETON MEN SOCIALLY SOME WE HAVE FOUND
3245-62828-0008 ARE OCCASIONALLY INVITED TO DROP IN AFTER DINNER THESE WE ASSUME ARE RECRUITED FROM THE RANKS OF THOSE PRINCETONIANS WHO HAVE TIED YALE OR HARVARD OR AT LEAST HELD THE SCORE DOWN
3245-62828-0009 WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO SAY IN FACT THE ONLY PRINCETON NAME WHICH COMES TO MIND AT THE MOMENT IS THAT OF BIG BILL EDWARDS WHO USED TO SIT IN THE CUSTOMS HOUSE AND THROW THEM ALL FOR A LOSS
3245-62828-0010 MORTON CAN HARDLY BE INTENDED FOR EDWARDS BECAUSE IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANYBODY WOULD EVER HAVE ENGAGED BIG BILL TO RIDE HORSES NO NOT EVEN TO BREAK THEM
3245-62828-0011 A CERTAIN MISTER STRINGHAM HERE TO BE SURE IDENTIFICATION IS EASY STRINGHAM WE HAVEN'T A DOUBT IS ROPER WE COULD WISH MISTER CAMP HAD BEEN MORE SUBTLE
3245-62828-0012 BUT HE HAD MORE OF AN AIR WITH HIM THUS IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE HARVARD GAME IT IS RECORDED
3245-62828-0013 GEORGE YIELDED TO HIS OLD HABIT AND SLIPPED OFF TO ONE SIDE AT A HAZARD THE ENEMY'S SECONDARY DEFENSE HAD BEEN DRAWING IN THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR ENOUGH TO STOP HIM WITHIN THOSE TEN YARDS
3245-62828-0014 WAS THE USUAL FORM OF HER REPLIES TO HIS ARDENT WORDS OF WOOING NATURALLY HE KNEW THAT HE HAD HER ON THE RUN A MAN WHO HAD TAKEN MORE THAN ONE STRAIGHT ARM SQUARELY IN THE FACE DURING THE COURSE OF HIS FOOTBALL CAREER
3245-62828-0015 WAS NOT TO BE REBUFFED BY A SLIP OF A GIRL THE WAR DELAYED MATTERS FOR A TIME AND GEORGE WENT AND WAS GOOD AT THAT TOO
3245-62828-0016 FOR A TIME WE FEARED THAT HE WAS IN DANGER OF BECOMING A SNOB BUT THE GREAT DEMOCRATIZING FORCES OF THE CONFLICT CARRIED HIM INTO THE CURRENT ONE OF THE MOST THRILLING CHAPTERS IN THE BOOK
3245-62828-0017 TO GO FORWARD AND RESCUE AN AMERICAN WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A YALE MAN THERE WAS NO STOPPING GEORGE MORTON IN THE END HE WORE SYLVIA DOWN NOTHING ELSE COULD BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH A MAN
3245-62828-0018 AND HE HAD EVEN HIT THE HARVARD LINE UPON OCCASION WITHOUT LOSING A YARD HIS HEAD WAS HARD AND HE COULD NOT TAKE A HINT IN THE END SYLVIA JUST HAD TO MARRY HIM
