3553-697-0000 I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW ONE CAN LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBORS IT'S JUST ONE'S NEIGHBORS TO MY MIND THAT ONE CAN'T LOVE THOUGH ONE MIGHT LOVE THOSE AT A DISTANCE
3553-697-0001 I ONCE READ SOMEWHERE OF JOHN THE MERCIFUL A SAINT THAT WHEN A HUNGRY FROZEN BEGGAR CAME TO HIM HE TOOK HIM INTO HIS BED HELD HIM IN HIS ARMS AND BEGAN BREATHING INTO HIS MOUTH
3553-697-0002 WHICH WAS PUTRID AND LOATHSOME FROM SOME AWFUL DISEASE I AM CONVINCED THAT HE DID THAT FROM SELF LACERATION FROM THE SELF LACERATION OF FALSITY FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHARITY IMPOSED BY DUTY
3553-697-0003 AS A PENANCE LAID ON HIM FOR ANY ONE TO LOVE A MAN HE MUST BE HIDDEN
3553-697-0004 LOVE IS GONE FATHER ZOSSIMA HAS TALKED OF THAT MORE THAN ONCE OBSERVED ALYOSHA HE TOO SAID THAT THE FACE OF A MAN OFTEN HINDERS MANY PEOPLE NOT PRACTICED IN LOVE FROM LOVING HIM
3553-697-0005 BUT YET THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF LOVE IN MANKIND AND ALMOST CHRIST LIKE LOVE
3553-697-0006 WELL I KNOW NOTHING OF IT SO FAR
3553-697-0007 AND THE INNUMERABLE MASS OF MANKIND ARE WITH ME THERE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT'S DUE TO MEN'S BAD QUALITIES OR WHETHER IT'S INHERENT IN THEIR NATURE TO MY THINKING CHRIST LIKE LOVE FOR MEN IS A MIRACLE IMPOSSIBLE ON EARTH
3553-697-0008 HE WAS GOD BUT WE ARE NOT GODS SUPPOSE I FOR INSTANCE SUFFER INTENSELY ANOTHER CAN NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH I SUFFER BECAUSE HE IS ANOTHER AND NOT I AND WHAT'S MORE
3553-697-0009 A MAN IS RARELY READY TO ADMIT ANOTHER'S SUFFERING AS THOUGH IT WERE A DISTINCTION WHY WON'T HE ADMIT IT DO YOU THINK BECAUSE I SMELL UNPLEASANT BECAUSE I HAVE A STUPID FACE BECAUSE I ONCE TROD ON HIS FOOT BESIDES
3553-697-0010 THERE IS SUFFERING AND SUFFERING DEGRADING HUMILIATING SUFFERING SUCH AS HUMBLES ME HUNGER FOR INSTANCE MY BENEFACTOR WILL PERHAPS ALLOW ME BUT WHEN YOU COME TO HIGHER SUFFERING FOR AN IDEA FOR INSTANCE
3553-697-0011 HE WILL VERY RARELY ADMIT THAT PERHAPS BECAUSE MY FACE STRIKES HIM AS NOT AT ALL WHAT HE FANCIES A MAN SHOULD HAVE WHO SUFFERS FOR AN IDEA
3553-697-0012 BEGGARS ESPECIALLY GENTEEL BEGGARS OUGHT NEVER TO SHOW THEMSELVES BUT TO ASK FOR CHARITY THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS ONE CAN LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBORS IN THE ABSTRACT OR EVEN AT A DISTANCE
3553-697-0013 BUT AT CLOSE QUARTERS IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
3553-697-0014 THEN ONE MIGHT LIKE LOOKING AT THEM BUT EVEN THEN WE SHOULD NOT LOVE THEM BUT ENOUGH OF THAT I SIMPLY WANTED TO SHOW YOU MY POINT OF VIEW
3553-697-0015 BUT WE HAD BETTER CONFINE OURSELVES TO THE SUFFERINGS OF THE CHILDREN THAT REDUCES THE SCOPE OF MY ARGUMENT TO A TENTH OF WHAT IT WOULD BE STILL WE'D BETTER KEEP TO THE CHILDREN THOUGH IT DOES WEAKEN MY CASE BUT
3553-697-0016 IN THE FIRST PLACE CHILDREN CAN BE LOVED EVEN AT CLOSE QUARTERS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE DIRTY EVEN WHEN THEY ARE UGLY I FANCY THOUGH CHILDREN NEVER ARE UGLY THE SECOND REASON WHY I WON'T SPEAK OF GROWN UP PEOPLE IS THAT
3553-697-0017 BESIDES BEING DISGUSTING AND UNWORTHY OF LOVE THEY HAVE A COMPENSATION THEY'VE EATEN THE APPLE AND KNOW GOOD AND EVIL AND THEY HAVE BECOME LIKE GODS THEY GO ON EATING IT STILL
3553-697-0018 BUT THE CHILDREN HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING AND ARE SO FAR INNOCENT
3553-697-0019 THEY MUST BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR FATHERS WHO HAVE EATEN THE APPLE BUT THAT REASONING IS OF THE OTHER WORLD AND IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE FOR THE HEART OF MAN HERE ON EARTH
3553-697-0020 THE INNOCENT MUST NOT SUFFER FOR ANOTHER'S SINS AND ESPECIALLY SUCH INNOCENTS YOU MAY BE SURPRISED AT ME ALYOSHA BUT I AM AWFULLY FOND OF CHILDREN TOO AND OBSERVE
3553-697-0021 CRUEL PEOPLE THE VIOLENT THE RAPACIOUS THE KARAMAZOVS ARE SOMETIMES VERY FOND OF CHILDREN CHILDREN WHILE THEY ARE QUITE LITTLE UP TO SEVEN FOR INSTANCE
3553-697-0022 AS IT WERE OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES I KNEW A CRIMINAL IN PRISON
3553-697-0023 MURDERED WHOLE FAMILIES INCLUDING SEVERAL CHILDREN BUT WHEN HE WAS IN PRISON HE HAD A STRANGE AFFECTION FOR THEM HE SPENT ALL HIS TIME AT HIS WINDOW WATCHING THE CHILDREN PLAYING IN THE PRISON YARD
3553-697-0024 HE TRAINED ONE LITTLE BOY TO COME UP TO HIS WINDOW AND MADE GREAT FRIENDS WITH HIM YOU DON'T KNOW WHY I AM TELLING YOU ALL THIS ALYOSHA MY HEAD ACHES AND I AM SAD YOU SPEAK WITH A
3553-697-0025 STRANGE AIR OBSERVED ALYOSHA UNEASILY AS THOUGH YOU WERE NOT QUITE YOURSELF BY THE WAY A BULGARIAN I MET LATELY IN MOSCOW
3553-697-0026 TOLD ME ABOUT THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY TURKS AND CIRCASSIANS IN ALL PARTS OF BULGARIA THROUGH FEAR OF A GENERAL RISING OF THE SLAVS
3553-697-0027 MURDER OUTRAGE WOMEN AND CHILDREN THEY NAIL THEIR PRISONERS BY THE EARS TO THE FENCES
3553-697-0028 THEY HANG THEM ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
3553-697-0029 BUT THAT'S A GREAT INJUSTICE AND INSULT TO THE BEASTS A BEAST CAN NEVER BE SO CRUEL AS A MAN SO
3553-697-0030 THAT'S ALL HE CAN DO HE WOULD NEVER THINK OF NAILING PEOPLE BY THE EARS EVEN IF HE WERE ABLE TO DO IT THESE TURKS TOOK A PLEASURE IN TORTURING CHILDREN TOO CUTTING THE UNBORN CHILD
3553-697-0031 FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB AND TOSSING BABIES UP IN THE AIR AND CATCHING THEM ON THE POINTS OF THEIR BAYONETS BEFORE THEIR MOTHERS EYES DOING IT BEFORE THE MOTHERS EYES WAS WHAT GAVE ZEST TO THE AMUSEMENT
3553-697-0032 HERE IS ANOTHER SCENE THAT I THOUGHT VERY INTERESTING IMAGINE A TREMBLING MOTHER WITH HER BABY IN HER ARMS
3553-697-0033 THEY'VE PLANNED A DIVERSION THEY PET THE BABY LAUGH TO MAKE IT LAUGH THEY SUCCEED THE BABY LAUGHS AT THAT MOMENT A TURK POINTS A PISTOL FOUR INCHES FROM THE BABY'S FACE
3553-697-0034 THE BABY LAUGHS WITH GLEE HOLDS OUT ITS LITTLE HANDS TO THE PISTOL AND HE PULLS THE TRIGGER IN THE BABY'S FACE AND BLOWS OUT ITS BRAINS ARTISTIC WASN'T IT BY THE WAY
3553-697-0035 TURKS ARE PARTICULARLY FOND OF SWEET THINGS THEY SAY BROTHER WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
3553-697-0036 I THINK IF THE DEVIL DOESN'T EXIST BUT MAN HAS CREATED HIM HE HAS CREATED HIM IN HIS OWN IMAGE AND LIKENESS JUST AS HE DID GOD THEN
3553-697-0037 OBSERVED ALYOSHA IT'S WONDERFUL HOW YOU CAN TURN WORDS AS POLONIUS SAYS IN HAMLET LAUGHED IVAN YOU TURN MY WORDS AGAINST ME WELL I AM GLAD
3553-697-0038 YOURS MUST BE A FINE GOD IF MAN CREATED HIM IN HIS IMAGE AND LIKENESS
3553-697-0039 I AM FOND OF COLLECTING CERTAIN FACTS AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE
3553-697-0040 FROM NEWSPAPERS AND BOOKS AND I'VE ALREADY GOT A FINE COLLECTION THE TURKS OF COURSE
3553-697-0041 BUT THEY ARE FOREIGNERS I HAVE SPECIMENS FROM HOME THAT ARE EVEN BETTER THAN THE TURKS YOU KNOW WE PREFER BEATING RODS AND SCOURGES THAT'S OUR NATIONAL INSTITUTION NAILING EARS
3553-697-0042 IS UNTHINKABLE FOR US FOR WE ARE AFTER ALL EUROPEANS BUT THE ROD AND THE SCOURGE WE HAVE ALWAYS WITH US AND THEY CANNOT BE TAKEN FROM US ABROAD NOW THEY SCARCELY DO ANY BEATING
3553-697-0043 MANNERS ARE MORE HUMANE OR LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED SO THAT THEY DON'T DARE TO FLOG MEN NOW
3553-697-0044 AND SO NATIONAL THAT IT WOULD BE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AMONG US THOUGH I BELIEVE WE ARE BEING INOCULATED WITH IT SINCE THE RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT BEGAN IN OUR ARISTOCRACY
3553-697-0045 I HAVE A CHARMING PAMPHLET TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH DESCRIBING HOW QUITE RECENTLY FIVE YEARS AGO A MURDERER RICHARD WAS EXECUTED A YOUNG MAN I BELIEVE OF
3553-697-0046 THREE AND TWENTY WHO REPENTED AND WAS CONVERTED TO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH AT THE VERY SCAFFOLD THIS RICHARD WAS AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD WHO WAS GIVEN
3553-697-0047 AS A CHILD OF SIX BY HIS PARENTS TO SOME SHEPHERDS ON THE SWISS MOUNTAINS THEY BROUGHT HIM UP TO WORK FOR THEM HE GREW UP LIKE A LITTLE WILD BEAST AMONG THEM THE SHEPHERDS TAUGHT HIM NOTHING AND SCARCELY FED OR CLOTHED HIM
3553-697-0048 BUT SENT HIM OUT AT SEVEN TO HERD THE FLOCK IN COLD AND WET AND NO ONE HESITATED OR SCRUPLED TO TREAT HIM SO QUITE THE CONTRARY THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT FOR RICHARD HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THEM AS A CHATTEL
3553-697-0049 AND THEY DID NOT EVEN SEE THE NECESSITY OF FEEDING HIM RICHARD HIMSELF DESCRIBES HOW IN THOSE YEARS LIKE THE PRODIGAL SON IN THE GOSPEL HE LONGED TO EAT OF THE MASH GIVEN TO THE PIGS WHICH WERE FATTENED FOR SALE
3553-697-0050 AND BEAT HIM WHEN HE STOLE FROM THE PIGS AND THAT WAS HOW HE SPENT ALL HIS CHILDHOOD AND HIS YOUTH TILL HE GREW UP AND WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO GO AWAY AND BE A THIEF THE SAVAGE BEGAN TO EARN HIS LIVING
3553-697-0051 AS A DAY LABORER IN GENEVA HE DRANK WHAT HE EARNED HE LIVED LIKE A BRUTE AND FINISHED BY KILLING AND ROBBING AN OLD MAN HE WAS CAUGHT TRIED AND CONDEMNED
