2185-150123-0000 CHAPTER TEN PERHAPS THERE IS NOTHING MORE DELIGHTFUL IN THE ROMANCE OF BOYHOOD THAN THE FINDING OF SOME SECRET HIDING PLACE WHITHER A BODY MAY CREEP AWAY FROM THE BUSTLE OF THE WORLD'S LIFE TO NESTLE IN QUIETNESS FOR AN HOUR OR TWO
2185-150123-0001 MORE ESPECIALLY IS SUCH DELIGHTFUL
2185-150123-0002 ONE MAY LOOK DOWN UPON THE BUSTLING MATTERS OF BUSY EVERY DAY LIFE WHILE ONE LIES SNUGLY HIDDEN AWAY UNSEEN BY ANY AS THOUGH ONE WERE IN SOME STRANGE INVISIBLE WORLD OF ONE'S OWN
2185-150123-0003 MYLES AND GASCOYNE FOUND ONE SUMMER AFTERNOON THEY CALLED IT THEIR EYRY AND THE NAME SUITED WELL FOR THE ROOSTING PLACE OF THE YOUNG HAWKS THAT RESTED IN ITS WINDY STILLNESS LOOKING DOWN UPON THE SHIFTING CASTLE LIFE IN THE COURTS BELOW BEHIND THE NORTH STABLE

2185-150123-0005 SWINE AND POULTRY FROM ONE PART OF THESE ANCIENT WALLS AND FRONTING AN INNER COURT OF THE CASTLE AROSE A TALL CIRCULAR HEAVY BUTTRESSED TOWER CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE OTHER BUILDINGS AND SO MANTLED WITH A DENSE GROWTH OF AGED IVY
2185-150123-0006 AS TO STAND A SHAFT OF SOLID GREEN ABOVE ITS CRUMBLING CROWN CIRCLED HUNDREDS OF PIGEONS WHITE AND PIED CLAPPING AND CLATTERING IN NOISY FLIGHT THROUGH THE SUNNY AIR SEVERAL WINDOWS SOME CLOSED WITH SHUTTERS
2185-150123-0007 AND NEAR THE TOP OF THE PILE WAS A ROW OF ARCHED OPENINGS AS THOUGH OF A BALCONY OR AN AIRY GALLERY MYLES HAD MORE THAN ONCE FELT AN IDLE CURIOSITY ABOUT THIS TOWER AND ONE DAY AS HE AND GASCOYNE SAT TOGETHER

2185-150123-0019 THE CLIMBING FROM ROOF TO ROOF WAS A MATTER EASY ENOUGH TO AN ACTIVE PAIR OF LADS LIKE THEMSELVES BUT WHEN BY AND BY THEY REACHED THE WALL OF THE TOWER ITSELF THEY FOUND THE HIDDEN WINDOW MUCH HIGHER FROM THE ROOF THAN THEY HAD JUDGED FROM BELOW
2185-150123-0020 PERHAPS TEN OR TWELVE FEET AND IT WAS BESIDES BEYOND THE EAVES AND OUT OF THEIR REACH MYLES LOOKED UP AND LOOKED DOWN ABOVE WAS THE BUSHY THICKNESS OF THE IVY THE BRANCHES AS THICK AS A WOMAN'S WRIST

2185-150123-0026 THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A SMALL TRIANGULAR PASSAGE WAY FROM WHICH A STEEP FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS LED DOWN THROUGH A HOLLOW IN THE MASSIVE WALL TO THE ROOM BELOW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS WAS A HEAVY OAKEN DOOR WHICH STOOD AJAR
2185-150123-0027 HANGING UPON A SINGLE RUSTY HINGE AND FROM THE ROOM WITHIN A DULL GRAY LIGHT GLIMMERED FAINTLY MYLES PUSHED THE DOOR FARTHER OPEN IT CREAKED AND GRATED HORRIBLY ON ITS RUSTY HINGE AND

2185-150123-0036 AN WE TARRY HERE LONGER WE WILL HAVE CHANCE TO SEE NO OTHER SIGHTS THE SUN IS FALLING LOW AN ARCHED STAIR WAY UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM FROM WHICH THEY HAD ENTERED WOUND UPWARD THROUGH THE WALL
2185-150123-0037 THE STONE STEPS BEING LIGHTED BY NARROW SLITS OF WINDOWS CUT THROUGH THE MASSIVE MASONRY ABOVE THE ROOM THEY HAD JUST LEFT WAS ANOTHER OF THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE BUT WITH AN OAK FLOOR SAGGING AND RISING INTO HOLLOWS AND HILLS WHERE THE JOIST HAD ROTTED AWAY BENEATH

2185-150123-0042 THEY SAT UP AND LOOKED AROUND THEM IN SILENT WONDER THEY WERE IN A BOWER OF LEAFY GREEN IT WAS THE TOP STORY OF THE TOWER THE ROOF OF WHICH HAD CRUMBLED AND TOPPLED IN LEAVING IT OPEN TO THE SKY
2185-150123-0043 WITH ONLY HERE AND THERE A SLANTING BEAM OR TWO SUPPORTING A PORTION OF THE TILED ROOF
