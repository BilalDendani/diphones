1374-133833-0065 AND FOR SHAME UPON YOU OH FOR SHAME TO ACCUSE ME OF BEING A BAD MOTHER TO MY SON
1374-133833-0066 THE BYSTANDERS ON AND OFF THE DINING ROOM CHAIRS RAISED A MURMUR OF SYMPATHY WITH MISSUS PEGLER AND MISTER GRADGRIND FELT HIMSELF INNOCENTLY PLACED IN A VERY DISTRESSING PREDICAMENT WHEN MISTER BOUNDERBY
1374-133833-0067 WHO HAD NEVER CEASED WALKING UP AND DOWN AND HAD EVERY MOMENT SWELLED LARGER AND LARGER AND GROWN REDDER AND REDDER STOPPED SHORT I DONT EXACTLY KNOW SAID MISTER BOUNDERBY HOW I COME TO BE FAVOURED WITH THE ATTENDANCE OF THE PRESENT COMPANY
1374-133833-0068 BUT I DONT INQUIRE WHEN THEYRE QUITE SATISFIED
1374-133833-0069 WHETHER THEYRE SATISFIED OR NOT PERHAPS THEYLL BE SO GOOD AS TO DISPERSE
1374-133833-0070 I HAVE NOT UNDERTAKEN TO DO IT
1374-133833-0071 THEREFORE THOSE WHO EXPECT ANY EXPLANATION WHATEVER UPON THAT BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT WILL BE DISAPPOINTEDPARTICULARLY TOM GRADGRIND AND HE CANT KNOW IT TOO SOON IN REFERENCE TO THE BANK ROBBERY THERE HAS BEEN A MISTAKE MADE CONCERNING MY MOTHER
1374-133833-0072 IF THERE HADNT BEEN OVER OFFICIOUSNESS IT WOULDNT HAVE BEEN MADE AND I HATE OVER OFFICIOUSNESS AT ALL TIMES WHETHER OR NO GOOD EVENING ALTHOUGH MISTER BOUNDERBY CARRIED IT OFF IN THESE TERMS
1374-133833-0073 HOLDING THE DOOR OPEN FOR THE COMPANY TO DEPART THERE WAS A BLUSTERING SHEEPISHNESS UPON HIM AT ONCE EXTREMELY CRESTFALLEN AND SUPERLATIVELY ABSURD DETECTED AS THE BULLY OF HUMILITY
1374-133833-0074 WHO HAD BUILT HIS WINDY REPUTATION UPON LIES AND IN HIS BOASTFULNESS HAD PUT THE HONEST TRUTH AS FAR AWAY FROM HIM AS IF HE HAD ADVANCED THE MEAN CLAIM THERE IS NO MEANER TO TACK HIMSELF ON TO A PEDIGREE HE CUT A MOST RIDICULOUS FIGURE
1374-133833-0075 WITH THE PEOPLE FILING OFF AT THE DOOR HE HELD WHO HE KNEW WOULD CARRY WHAT HAD PASSED TO THE WHOLE TOWN TO BE GIVEN TO THE FOUR WINDS HE COULD NOT HAVE LOOKED A BULLY MORE SHORN AND FORLORN IF HE HAD HAD HIS EARS CROPPED
1374-133833-0076 EVEN THAT UNLUCKY FEMALE MISSUS SPARSIT
1374-133833-0077 WAS NOT IN SO BAD A PLIGHT AS THAT REMARKABLE MAN AND SELF MADE HUMBUG JOSIAH BOUNDERBY OF COKETOWN RACHAEL AND SISSY
1374-133833-0078 LEAVING MISSUS PEGLER TO OCCUPY A BED AT HER SONS FOR THAT NIGHT WALKED TOGETHER TO THE GATE OF STONE LODGE AND THERE PARTED MISTER GRADGRIND JOINED THEM BEFORE THEY HAD GONE VERY FAR AND SPOKE WITH MUCH INTEREST OF STEPHEN BLACKPOOL
1374-133833-0079 FOR WHOM HE THOUGHT THIS SIGNAL FAILURE OF THE SUSPICIONS AGAINST MISSUS PEGLER WAS LIKELY TO WORK WELL AS TO THE WHELP THROUGHOUT THIS SCENE AS ON ALL OTHER LATE OCCASIONS HE HAD STUCK CLOSE TO BOUNDERBY
1374-133833-0080 HE SEEMED TO FEEL THAT AS LONG AS BOUNDERBY COULD MAKE NO DISCOVERY WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE HE WAS SO FAR SAFE HE NEVER VISITED HIS SISTER AND HAD ONLY SEEN HER ONCE SINCE SHE WENT HOME
1374-133833-0081 THAT IS TO SAY ON THE NIGHT WHEN HE STILL STUCK CLOSE TO BOUNDERBY AS ALREADY RELATED THERE WAS ONE DIM UNFORMED FEAR LINGERING ABOUT HIS SISTERS MIND TO WHICH SHE NEVER GAVE UTTERANCE
1374-133833-0082 WHICH SURROUNDED THE GRACELESS AND UNGRATEFUL BOY WITH A DREADFUL MYSTERY THE SAME DARK POSSIBILITY HAD PRESENTED ITSELF IN THE SAME SHAPELESS GUISE THIS VERY DAY TO SISSY WHEN RACHAEL SPOKE OF SOME ONE
1374-133833-0083 WHO WOULD BE CONFOUNDED BY STEPHENS RETURN HAVING PUT HIM OUT OF THE WAY LOUISA HAD NEVER SPOKEN OF HARBOURING ANY SUSPICION OF HER BROTHER IN CONNEXION WITH THE ROBBERY
1374-133833-0084 SHE AND SISSY HAD HELD NO CONFIDENCE ON THE SUBJECT SAVE IN THAT ONE INTERCHANGE OF LOOKS WHEN THE UNCONSCIOUS FATHER RESTED HIS GRAY HEAD ON HIS HAND BUT IT WAS UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN THEM AND THEY BOTH KNEW IT
1374-133833-0085 THIS OTHER FEAR WAS SO AWFUL THAT IT HOVERED ABOUT EACH OF THEM LIKE A GHOSTLY SHADOW NEITHER DARING TO THINK OF ITS BEING NEAR HERSELF FAR LESS OF ITS BEING NEAR THE OTHER AND STILL THE FORCED SPIRIT WHICH THE WHELP HAD PLUCKED UP
1374-133833-0086 THROVE WITH HIM IF STEPHEN BLACKPOOL WAS NOT THE THIEF LET HIM SHOW HIMSELF WHY DIDNT HE ANOTHER NIGHT ANOTHER DAY AND NIGHT
