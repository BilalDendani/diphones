6351-65787-0000 TO ALL APPEARANCE IT HAD BEEN TEMPORARILY AND VERY LATELY ABANDONED WE ESTABLISHED OURSELVES IN ONE OF THE SMALLEST AND LEAST SUMPTUOUSLY FURNISHED APARTMENTS IT LAY IN A REMOTE TURRET OF THE BUILDING ITS DECORATIONS WERE RICH
6351-65787-0001 YET TATTERED AND ANTIQUE ITS WALLS WERE HUNG WITH TAPESTRY AND BEDECKED WITH MANIFOLD AND MULTIFORM ARMORIAL TROPHIES TOGETHER WITH AN UNUSUALLY GREAT NUMBER OF VERY SPIRITED MODERN PAINTINGS IN FRAMES OF RICH GOLDEN ARABESQUE
6351-65787-0002 IN THESE PAINTINGS WHICH DEPENDED FROM THE WALLS NOT ONLY IN THEIR MAIN SURFACES BUT IN VERY MANY NOOKS WHICH THE BIZARRE ARCHITECTURE OF THE CHATEAU RENDERED NECESSARY IN THESE PAINTINGS MY INCIPIENT DELIRIUM PERHAPS HAD CAUSED ME TO TAKE DEEP INTEREST
6351-65787-0003 SO THAT I BADE PEDRO TO CLOSE THE HEAVY SHUTTERS OF THE ROOM SINCE IT WAS ALREADY NIGHT TO LIGHT THE TONGUES OF A TALL CANDELABRUM WHICH STOOD BY THE HEAD OF MY BED AND TO THROW OPEN FAR AND WIDE THE FRINGED CURTAINS OF BLACK VELVET
6351-65787-0004 WHICH ENVELOPED THE BED ITSELF I WISHED ALL THIS DONE THAT I MIGHT RESIGN MYSELF IF NOT TO SLEEP AT LEAST ALTERNATELY TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF THESE PICTURES AND THE PERUSAL OF A SMALL VOLUME WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND UPON THE PILLOW
6351-65787-0005 AND WHICH PURPORTED TO CRITICISE AND DESCRIBE THEM LONG LONG I READ AND DEVOUTLY DEVOTEDLY I GAZED RAPIDLY AND GLORIOUSLY THE HOURS FLEW BY AND THE DEEP MIDNIGHT CAME
6351-65787-0006 THE POSITION OF THE CANDELABRUM DISPLEASED ME AND OUTREACHING MY HAND WITH DIFFICULTY RATHER THAN DISTURB MY SLUMBERING VALET I PLACED IT SO AS TO THROW ITS RAYS MORE FULLY UPON THE BOOK BUT THE ACTION PRODUCED AN EFFECT ALTOGETHER UNANTICIPATED
6351-65787-0007 THE RAYS OF THE NUMEROUS CANDLES FOR THERE WERE MANY NOW FELL WITHIN A NICHE OF THE ROOM WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN THROWN INTO DEEP SHADE BY ONE OF THE BED POSTS I THUS SAW IN VIVID LIGHT A PICTURE ALL UNNOTICED BEFORE
6351-65787-0008 IT WAS THE PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG GIRL JUST RIPENING INTO WOMANHOOD I GLANCED AT THE PAINTING HURRIEDLY AND THEN CLOSED MY EYES WHY I DID THIS WAS NOT AT FIRST APPARENT EVEN TO MY OWN PERCEPTION BUT WHILE MY LIDS REMAINED THUS SHUT
6351-65787-0009 I RAN OVER IN MY MIND MY REASON FOR SO SHUTTING THEM IT WAS AN IMPULSIVE MOVEMENT TO GAIN TIME FOR THOUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY VISION HAD NOT DECEIVED ME TO CALM AND SUBDUE MY FANCY FOR A MORE SOBER AND MORE CERTAIN GAZE
6351-65787-0010 IN A VERY FEW MOMENTS I AGAIN LOOKED FIXEDLY AT THE PAINTING THAT I NOW SAW ARIGHT I COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT DOUBT FOR THE FIRST FLASHING OF THE CANDLES UPON THAT CANVAS HAD SEEMED TO DISSIPATE THE DREAMY STUPOR WHICH WAS STEALING OVER MY SENSES
6351-65787-0011 AND TO STARTLE ME AT ONCE INTO WAKING LIFE THE PORTRAIT I HAVE ALREADY SAID WAS THAT OF A YOUNG GIRL IT WAS A MERE HEAD AND SHOULDERS DONE IN WHAT IS TECHNICALLY TERMED A VIGNETTE MANNER MUCH IN THE STYLE OF THE FAVORITE HEADS OF SULLY
6351-65787-0012 THE ARMS THE BOSOM AND EVEN THE ENDS OF THE RADIANT HAIR MELTED IMPERCEPTIBLY INTO THE VAGUE YET DEEP SHADOW WHICH FORMED THE BACK GROUND OF THE WHOLE THE FRAME WAS OVAL RICHLY GILDED AND FILIGREED IN MORESQUE
6351-65787-0013 AS A THING OF ART NOTHING COULD BE MORE ADMIRABLE THAN THE PAINTING ITSELF BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN NEITHER THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK NOR THE IMMORTAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTENANCE WHICH HAD SO SUDDENLY AND SO VEHEMENTLY MOVED ME
6351-65787-0014 LEAST OF ALL COULD IT HAVE BEEN THAT MY FANCY SHAKEN FROM ITS HALF SLUMBER HAD MISTAKEN THE HEAD FOR THAT OF A LIVING PERSON I SAW AT ONCE THAT THE PECULIARITIES OF THE DESIGN OF THE VIGNETTING AND OF THE FRAME MUST HAVE INSTANTLY DISPELLED SUCH IDEA
6351-65787-0015 MUST HAVE PREVENTED EVEN ITS MOMENTARY ENTERTAINMENT THINKING EARNESTLY UPON THESE POINTS I REMAINED FOR AN HOUR PERHAPS HALF SITTING HALF RECLINING WITH MY VISION RIVETED UPON THE PORTRAIT AT LENGTH
6351-65787-0016 SATISFIED WITH THE TRUE SECRET OF ITS EFFECT I FELL BACK WITHIN THE BED I HAD FOUND THE SPELL OF THE PICTURE IN AN ABSOLUTE LIFE LIKELINESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH AT FIRST STARTLING FINALLY CONFOUNDED SUBDUED
6351-65787-0017 AND APPALLED ME WITH DEEP AND REVERENT AWE I REPLACED THE CANDELABRUM IN ITS FORMER POSITION THE CAUSE OF MY DEEP AGITATION BEING THUS SHUT FROM VIEW I SOUGHT EAGERLY THE VOLUME WHICH DISCUSSED THE PAINTINGS AND THEIR HISTORIES
6351-65787-0018 TURNING TO THE NUMBER WHICH DESIGNATED THE OVAL PORTRAIT I THERE READ THE VAGUE AND QUAINT WORDS WHICH FOLLOW SHE WAS A MAIDEN OF RAREST BEAUTY AND NOT MORE LOVELY THAN FULL OF GLEE
6351-65787-0019 AND EVIL WAS THE HOUR WHEN SHE SAW AND LOVED AND WEDDED THE PAINTER HE PASSIONATE STUDIOUS AUSTERE AND HAVING ALREADY A BRIDE IN HIS ART SHE A MAIDEN OF RAREST BEAUTY
6351-65787-0020 AND NOT MORE LOVELY THAN FULL OF GLEE ALL LIGHT AND SMILES AND FROLICSOME AS THE YOUNG FAWN LOVING AND CHERISHING ALL THINGS HATING ONLY THE ART WHICH WAS HER RIVAL
6351-65787-0021 DREADING ONLY THE PALLET AND BRUSHES AND OTHER UNTOWARD INSTRUMENTS WHICH DEPRIVED HER OF THE COUNTENANCE OF HER LOVER
6351-65787-0022 BUT SHE WAS HUMBLE AND OBEDIENT AND SAT MEEKLY FOR MANY WEEKS IN THE DARK HIGH TURRET CHAMBER WHERE THE LIGHT DRIPPED UPON THE PALE CANVAS ONLY FROM OVERHEAD BUT HE THE PAINTER TOOK GLORY IN HIS WORK
6351-65787-0023 WHICH WENT ON FROM HOUR TO HOUR AND FROM DAY TO DAY AND HE WAS A PASSIONATE AND WILD AND MOODY MAN WHO BECAME LOST IN REVERIES SO THAT HE WOULD NOT SEE THAT THE LIGHT WHICH FELL SO GHASTLY IN THAT LONE TURRET
6351-65787-0024 WITHERED THE HEALTH AND THE SPIRITS OF HIS BRIDE WHO PINED VISIBLY TO ALL BUT HIM YET SHE SMILED ON AND STILL ON UNCOMPLAININGLY BECAUSE SHE SAW THAT THE PAINTER WHO HAD HIGH RENOWN TOOK A FERVID
6351-65787-0025 AND BURNING PLEASURE IN HIS TASK AND WROUGHT DAY AND NIGHT TO DEPICT HER WHO SO LOVED HIM YET WHO GREW DAILY MORE DISPIRITED AND WEAK AND IN SOOTH SOME WHO BEHELD THE PORTRAIT SPOKE OF ITS RESEMBLANCE IN LOW WORDS AS OF A MIGHTY MARVEL
6351-65787-0026 AND A PROOF NOT LESS OF THE POWER OF THE PAINTER THAN OF HIS DEEP LOVE FOR HER WHOM HE DEPICTED SO SURPASSINGLY WELL
6351-65787-0027 FOR THE PAINTER HAD GROWN WILD WITH THE ARDOR OF HIS WORK AND TURNED HIS EYES FROM CANVAS MERELY EVEN TO REGARD THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS WIFE AND HE WOULD NOT SEE THAT THE TINTS WHICH HE SPREAD UPON THE CANVAS WERE DRAWN FROM THE CHEEKS OF HER WHO SATE BESIDE HIM
6351-65787-0028 AND WHEN MANY WEEKS HAD PASSED AND BUT LITTLE REMAINED TO DO SAVE ONE BRUSH UPON THE MOUTH AND ONE TINT UPON THE EYE THE SPIRIT OF THE LADY AGAIN FLICKERED UP AS THE FLAME WITHIN THE SOCKET OF THE LAMP AND THEN THE BRUSH WAS GIVEN
6351-65787-0029 AND THEN THE TINT WAS PLACED AND FOR ONE MOMENT THE PAINTER STOOD ENTRANCED BEFORE THE WORK WHICH HE HAD WROUGHT BUT IN THE NEXT WHILE HE YET GAZED
6351-65787-0030 THIS IS INDEED LIFE ITSELF TURNED SUDDENLY TO REGARD HIS BELOVED
