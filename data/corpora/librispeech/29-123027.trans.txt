29-123027-0000 HOW IT ENDED IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY MIDNIGHT WHEN I HEARD AT A GREAT DISTANCE THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S FEET SOMETIMES THE SOUND DIED AWAY THEN IT GREW CLEARER AGAIN
29-123027-0001 AND NEARER THE ROAD TO EARLSHALL LED THROUGH WOODS THAT BELONGED TO THE EARL THE SOUND CAME IN THAT DIRECTION AND I HOPED IT MIGHT BE SOME ONE COMING IN SEARCH OF US AS THE SOUND CAME NEARER AND NEARER
29-123027-0002 I WAS ALMOST SURE I COULD DISTINGUISH GINGER'S STEP
29-123027-0003 AND STOOPED DOWN OVER IT IT IS REUBEN HE SAID AND HE DOES NOT STIR THE OTHER MAN FOLLOWED AND BENT OVER HIM HE'S DEAD HE SAID
29-123027-0004 FEEL HOW COLD HIS HANDS ARE THEY RAISED HIM UP BUT THERE WAS NO LIFE AND HIS HAIR WAS SOAKED WITH BLOOD THEY LAID HIM DOWN AGAIN AND CAME AND LOOKED AT ME
29-123027-0005 THEY SOON SAW MY CUT KNEES WHY THE HORSE HAS BEEN DOWN AND THROWN HIM
29-123027-0006 LOOK HERE HIS HOOF IS CUT ALL TO PIECES HE MIGHT WELL COME DOWN POOR FELLOW I TELL YOU WHAT NED I'M AFRAID IT HASN'T BEEN ALL RIGHT WITH REUBEN JUST THINK OF HIS RIDING A HORSE OVER THESE STONES WITHOUT A SHOE
29-123027-0007 I'M AFRAID IT HAS BEEN THE OLD THING OVER AGAIN POOR SUSAN SHE LOOKED AWFULLY PALE WHEN SHE CAME TO MY HOUSE TO ASK IF HE HAD NOT COME HOME SHE MADE BELIEVE SHE WAS NOT A BIT ANXIOUS
29-123027-0008 BUT FOR ALL THAT SHE BEGGED ME TO GO AND MEET HIM BUT WHAT MUST WE DO THERE'S THE HORSE TO GET HOME AS WELL AS THE BODY AND THAT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER
29-123027-0009 BUT SHE KNEW AS WELL AS I DID WHAT WAS GOING ON AND STOOD AS STILL AS A STONE I NOTICED THAT BECAUSE IF SHE HAD A FAULT IT WAS THAT SHE WAS IMPATIENT IN STANDING
29-123027-0010 I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT WALK IT WAS MORE THAN THREE MILES ROBERT LED ME ON VERY SLOWLY
29-123027-0011 WITH GREAT PAIN I AM SURE HE WAS SORRY FOR ME FOR HE OFTEN PATTED AND ENCOURAGED ME TALKING TO ME IN A PLEASANT VOICE AT LAST I REACHED MY OWN BOX AND HAD SOME CORN
29-123027-0012 AND AFTER ROBERT HAD WRAPPED UP MY KNEES IN WET CLOTHS HE TIED UP MY FOOT IN A BRAN POULTICE TO DRAW OUT THE HEAT AND CLEANSE IT BEFORE THE HORSE DOCTOR SAW IT IN THE MORNING AND I MANAGED TO GET MYSELF DOWN ON THE STRAW
29-123027-0013 AND SLEPT IN SPITE OF THE PAIN THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE FARRIER HAD EXAMINED MY WOUNDS HE SAID HE HOPED THE JOINT WAS NOT INJURED AND IF SO I SHOULD NOT BE SPOILED FOR WORK
29-123027-0014 BUT I SHOULD NEVER LOSE THE BLEMISH I BELIEVE THEY DID THE BEST TO MAKE A GOOD CURE BUT IT WAS A LONG AND PAINFUL ONE PROUD FLESH AS THEY CALLED IT CAME UP IN MY KNEES AND WAS BURNED OUT WITH CAUSTIC
29-123027-0015 AND WHEN AT LAST IT WAS HEALED THEY PUT A BLISTERING FLUID OVER THE FRONT OF BOTH KNEES TO BRING ALL THE HAIR OFF THEY HAD SOME REASON FOR THIS AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AS SMITH'S DEATH HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN
29-123027-0016 AND MY SHOE WAS PICKED UP AMONG THE STONES SO THAT THE CASE WAS QUITE PLAIN TO THEM AND I WAS CLEARED OF ALL BLAME EVERYBODY PITIED SUSAN SHE WAS NEARLY OUT OF HER MIND
29-123027-0017 SO SHE WENT ON TILL AFTER HE WAS BURIED AND THEN AS SHE HAD NO HOME OR RELATIONS
