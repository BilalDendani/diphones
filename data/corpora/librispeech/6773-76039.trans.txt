6773-76039-0000 I AM ASTONISHED TO DISCOVER WHAT A BUNDLE OF DISCORDANT MOTIVES I AM I DO NOT SEEM TO DESERVE TO BE CALLED A PERSONALITY I CANNOT DISCOVER EVEN A GENERAL DIRECTION
6773-76039-0001 MUCH MORE AM I LIKE A TAXI CAB IN WHICH ALL SORTS OF AIMS AND DESIRES HAVE TRAVELLED TO THEIR DESTINATION AND GOT OUT ARE WE ALL LIKE THAT A BUNDLE HELD TOGETHER BY A NAME AND ADDRESS AND A CERTAIN THREAD OF MEMORY SAID THE DOCTOR AND CONSIDERED
6773-76039-0002 MORE THAN THAT MORE THAN THAT WE HAVE LEADING IDEAS ASSOCIATIONS POSSESSIONS LIABILITIES WE BUILD OURSELVES A PRISON OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT KEEPS US FROM COMPLETE DISPERSAL EXACTLY SAID THE DOCTOR AND THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING
6773-76039-0003 I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO RECALL MY SEXUAL HISTORY SAID SIR RICHMOND GOING OFF AT A TANGENT MY SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION I WONDER IF IT DIFFERS VERY WIDELY FROM YOURS OR MOST MEN'S SOME MEN ARE MORE EVENTFUL IN THESE MATTERS THAN OTHERS
6773-76039-0004 SAID THE DOCTOR IT SOUNDED WISTFULLY THEY HAVE THE SAME JUMBLE OF MOTIVES AND TRADITIONS I SUSPECT WHETHER THEY ARE EVENTFUL OR NOT THE BRAKES MAY BE STRONG OR WEAK BUT THE DRIVE IS THE SAME I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH OF THE BEGINNINGS OF CURIOSITY AND KNOWLEDGE IN THESE MATTERS CAN YOU
6773-76039-0005 NOT MUCH SAID THE DOCTOR NO YOUR PSYCHOANALYSTS TELL A STORY OF FEARS SUPPRESSIONS MONSTROUS IMAGINATIONS SYMBOLIC REPLACEMENTS I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH OF THAT SORT OF THING IN MY OWN CASE IT MAY HAVE FADED OUT OF MY MIND
6773-76039-0006 THERE WERE PROBABLY SOME UNEASY CURIOSITIES A GROTESQUE DREAM OR SO PERHAPS I CAN'T RECALL ANYTHING OF THAT SORT DISTINCTLY NOW I HAD A VERY LIVELY INTEREST IN WOMEN EVEN WHEN I WAS STILL QUITE A LITTLE BOY AND A CERTAIN WHAT SHALL I CALL IT
6773-76039-0007 IMAGINATIVE SLAVISHNESS NOT TOWARDS ACTUAL WOMEN BUT TOWARDS SOMETHING MAGNIFICENTLY FEMININE MY FIRST LOVE SIR RICHMOND SMILED AT SOME SECRET MEMORY
6773-76039-0008 MY FIRST LOVE WAS BRITANNIA AS DEPICTED BY TENNIEL IN THE CARTOONS IN PUNCH I MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY LITTLE CHAP AT THE TIME OF THE BRITANNIA AFFAIR I JUST CLUNG TO HER IN MY IMAGINATION AND DID DEVOTED THINGS FOR HER THEN I RECALL A LITTLE LATER
6773-76039-0009 A SECRET ABJECT ADORATION FOR THE WHITE GODDESSES OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE NOT FOR ANY PARTICULAR ONE OF THEM THAT I CAN REMEMBER FOR ALL OF THEM BUT I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING VERY MONSTROUS OR INCESTUOUS IN MY CHILDISH IMAGINATIONS SUCH THINGS AS FREUD I UNDERSTAND LAYS STRESS UPON
6773-76039-0010 IT HAS BEEN VERY COMPLETELY WASHED OUT AGAIN PERHAPS A CHILD WHICH IS BROUGHT UP IN A PROPER NURSERY OF ITS OWN AND SEES A LOT OF PICTURES OF THE NUDE HUMAN BODY AND SO ON GETS ITS MIND SHIFTED OFF ANY POSSIBLE CONCENTRATION UPON THE DOMESTIC ASPECT OF SEX
6773-76039-0011 I GOT TO DEFINITE KNOWLEDGE PRETTY EARLY BY THE TIME I WAS ELEVEN OR TWELVE NORMALLY WHAT IS NORMALLY DECENTLY ANYHOW HERE AGAIN I MAY BE FORGETTING MUCH SECRET AND SHAMEFUL CURIOSITY
6773-76039-0012 AND SOME DISSECTING OF RATS AND MICE MY SCHOOLMASTER WAS A CAPABLE SANE MAN IN ADVANCE OF HIS TIMES AND MY PEOPLE BELIEVED IN HIM I THINK MUCH OF THIS DISTORTED PERVERSE STUFF THAT GROWS UP IN PEOPLE'S MINDS ABOUT SEX AND DEVELOPS INTO EVIL VICES AND STILL MORE EVIL HABITS
6773-76039-0013 IS DUE TO THE MYSTERY WE MAKE ABOUT THESE THINGS NOT ENTIRELY SAID THE DOCTOR LARGELY WHAT CHILD UNDER A MODERN UPBRINGING EVER GOES THROUGH THE STUFFY HORRORS DESCRIBED IN JAMES JOYCE'S PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN
6773-76039-0014 I'VE NOT READ IT A PICTURE OF THE CATHOLIC ATMOSPHERE A YOUNG SOUL SHUT UP IN DARKNESS AND IGNORANCE TO ACCUMULATE FILTH IN THE NAME OF PURITY AND DECENCY AND UNDER THREATS OF HELL FIRE HORRIBLE QUITE
6773-76039-0015 A STUDY OF INTOLERABLE TENSIONS THE TENSIONS THAT MAKE YOUNG PEOPLE WRITE UNCLEAN WORDS IN SECRET PLACES
6773-76039-0016 WHERE NOTHING IS CONCEALED NOTHING CAN EXPLODE ON THE WHOLE I CAME UP TO ADOLESCENCE PRETTY STRAIGHT AND CLEAN SAID SIR RICHMOND WHAT STANDS OUT IN MY MEMORY NOW
6773-76039-0017 IS THIS IDEA OF A SORT OF WOMAN GODDESS WHO WAS VERY LOVELY AND KIND AND POWERFUL AND WONDERFUL THAT RULED MY SECRET IMAGINATIONS AS A BOY BUT IT WAS VERY MUCH IN MY MIND AS I GREW UP THE MOTHER COMPLEX
6773-76039-0018 SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU AS A PASSING BOTANIST MIGHT RECOGNIZE AND NAME A FLOWER SIR RICHMOND STARED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT IT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST CONNEXION WITH MY MOTHER OR ANY MOTHER OR ANY PARTICULAR WOMAN AT ALL
6773-76039-0019 FAR BETTER TO CALL IT THE GODDESS COMPLEX THE CONNEXION IS NOT PERHAPS IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE SAID THE DOCTOR THERE WAS NO CONNEXION SAID SIR RICHMOND
6773-76039-0020 THE WOMEN OF MY ADOLESCENT DREAMS WERE STRIPPED AND STRONG AND LOVELY THEY WERE GREAT CREATURES THEY CAME IT WAS CLEARLY TRACEABLE FROM PICTURES SCULPTURE AND FROM A DEFINITE RESPONSE IN MYSELF TO THEIR BEAUTY MY MOTHER HAD NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THAT
6773-76039-0021 THE WOMEN AND GIRLS ABOUT ME WERE FUSSY BUNCHES OF CLOTHES THAT I AM SURE I NEVER EVEN LINKED WITH THAT DREAM WORLD OF LOVE AND WORSHIP WERE YOU CO EDUCATED NO BUT I HAD A COUPLE OF SISTERS ONE OLDER ONE YOUNGER THAN MYSELF
6773-76039-0022 AND THERE WERE PLENTY OF GIRLS IN MY CIRCLE I THOUGHT SOME OF THEM PRETTY BUT THAT WAS A DIFFERENT AFFAIR I KNOW THAT I DIDN'T CONNECT THEM WITH THE IDEA OF THE LOVED AND WORSHIPPED GODDESSES AT ALL BECAUSE I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW THE GODDESS IN A REAL HUMAN BEING
6773-76039-0023 AND HOW AMAZED I WAS AT THE DISCOVERY I WAS A BOY OF TWELVE OR THIRTEEN MY PEOPLE TOOK ME ONE SUMMER TO DYMCHURCH IN ROMNEY MARSH IN THOSE DAYS BEFORE THE AUTOMOBILE HAD MADE THE MARSH ACCESSIBLE TO THE HYTHE AND FOLKESTONE CROWDS
6773-76039-0024 IT WAS A LITTLE OLD FORGOTTEN SILENT WIND BITTEN VILLAGE CROUCHING UNDER THE LEE OF THE GREAT SEA WALL AT LOW WATER THERE WERE MILES OF SAND AS SMOOTH AND SHINING AS THE SKIN OF A SAVAGE BROWN WOMAN SHINING AND WITH A TEXTURE THE VERY SAME
6773-76039-0025 AND ONE DAY AS I WAS MUCKING ABOUT BY MYSELF ON THE BEACH BOY FASHION THERE WERE SOME RIBS OF A WRECKED BOAT BURIED IN THE SAND NEAR A GROIN AND I WAS BUSY WITH THEM A GIRL RAN OUT FROM A TENT HIGH UP ON THE BEACH AND ACROSS THE SANDS TO THE WATER
6773-76039-0026 SHE WAS DRESSED IN A TIGHT BATHING DRESS AND NOT IN THE CLUMSY SKIRTS AND FRILLS THAT IT WAS THE CUSTOM TO INFLICT ON WOMEN IN THOSE DAYS HER HAIR WAS TIED UP IN A BLUE HANDKERCHIEF SHE RAN SWIFTLY AND GRACEFULLY INTENT UPON THE WHITE LINE OF FOAM AHEAD
6773-76039-0027 I CAN STILL REMEMBER HOW THE SUNLIGHT TOUCHED HER ROUND NECK AND CHEEK AS SHE WENT PAST ME SHE WAS THE LOVELIEST MOST SHAPELY THING I HAVE EVER SEEN TO THIS DAY SHE LIFTED UP HER ARMS AND THRUST THROUGH THE DAZZLING WHITE AND GREEN BREAKERS AND PLUNGED INTO THE WATER AND SWAM
6773-76039-0028 SHE SWAM STRAIGHT OUT FOR A LONG WAY AS IT SEEMED TO ME AND PRESENTLY CAME IN AND PASSED ME AGAIN ON HER WAY BACK TO HER TENT LIGHT AND SWIFT AND SURE THE VERY PRINTS OF HER FEET ON THE SAND WERE BEAUTIFUL
6773-76039-0029 SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT THERE COULD BE LIVING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AS LOVELY AS ANY GODDESS SHE WASN'T IN THE LEAST OUT OF BREATH
6773-76039-0030 I WONDER NOW WHY I HAVE KEPT THE THING SO SECRET UNTIL NOW I HAVE NEVER TOLD A SOUL ABOUT IT I RESORTED TO ALL SORTS OF TORTUOUS DEVICES AND EXCUSES TO GET A CHANCE OF SEEING HER AGAIN WITHOUT BETRAYING WHAT IT WAS I WAS AFTER DOCTOR MARTINEAU RETAINED A SIMPLE FONDNESS FOR A STORY
6773-76039-0031 A DAY OR SO LATER I WAS STABBED TO THE HEART BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE TENT SHE CAME OUT OF HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY SHE HAD GONE FOR EVER SIR RICHMOND SMILED BRIGHTLY AT THE DOCTOR'S DISAPPOINTMENT
6773-76039-0032 SECTION THREE I WAS NEVER WHOLEHEARTED AND SIMPLE ABOUT SEXUAL THINGS SIR RICHMOND RESUMED PRESENTLY NEVER
6773-76039-0033 I DO NOT THINK ANY MAN IS WE ARE TOO MUCH PLASTERED UP THINGS TOO MUCH THE CREATURES OF A TORTUOUS AND COMPLICATED EVOLUTION DOCTOR MARTINEAU UNDER HIS GREEN UMBRELLA NODDED HIS CONCEDED AGREEMENT THIS
6773-76039-0034 WHAT SHALL I CALL IT THIS DREAM OF WOMEN GREW UP IN MY MIND AS I GREW UP AS SOMETHING INDEPENDENT OF AND MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REALITY OF WOMEN IT CAME ONLY VERY SLOWLY INTO RELATION WITH THAT
6773-76039-0035 THAT GIRL ON THE DYMCHURCH BEACH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST LINKS BUT SHE CEASED VERY SPEEDILY TO BE REAL
6773-76039-0036 I THOUGHT OF THESE DREAM WOMEN NOT ONLY AS SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL BUT AS SOMETHING EXCEEDINGLY KIND AND HELPFUL THE GIRLS AND WOMEN I MET BELONGED TO A DIFFERENT CREATION SIR RICHMOND STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND ROWED A FEW LONG STROKES DOCTOR MARTINEAU SOUGHT INFORMATION
6773-76039-0037 THERE WAS A SENSUOUS ELEMENT IN THESE DREAMINGS CERTAINLY A VERY STRONG ONE IT DIDN'T DOMINATE BUT IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL UNDERTOW WAS THERE ANY TENDENCY IN ALL THIS IMAGINATIVE STUFF TO CONCENTRATE
6773-76039-0038 TO GROUP ITSELF ABOUT A SINGLE FIGURE THE SORT OF THING THAT VICTORIANS WOULD HAVE CALLED AN IDEAL NOT A BIT OF IT SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH CONVICTION
6773-76039-0039 AND THE NEXT I WOULD BE OFF OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH AN ARMED BRUNHILD
6773-76039-0040 AS A YOUNG MAN YES NONE AT ALL I CANNOT RECALL A SINGLE PHILOPROGENITIVE MOMENT THESE DREAM WOMEN WERE ALL CONCEIVED OF AND I WAS CONCEIVED OF AS BEING CONCERNED IN SOME TREMENDOUS ENTERPRISE SOMETHING QUITE BEYOND DOMESTICITY
6773-76039-0041 IT KEPT US RELATED GAVE US DIGNITY CERTAINLY IT WASN'T BABIES ALL THIS IS VERY INTERESTING VERY INTERESTING FROM THE SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW A PRIORI IT IS NOT WHAT ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED
6773-76039-0042 ONE MIGHT REASONABLY EXPECT A CONVERGENCE IF NOT A COMPLETE CONCENTRATION UPON THE IDEA OF OFFSPRING IT IS ALMOST AS IF
6773-76039-0043 ENDS TO BE SERVED IT IS CLEAR THAT NATURE HAS NOT WORKED THIS IMPULSE OUT TO ANY SIGHT OF ITS END HAS NOT PERHAPS TROUBLED TO DO SO THE INSTINCT OF THE MALE FOR THE FEMALE ISN'T PRIMARILY FOR OFFSPRING
6773-76039-0044 NOT EVEN IN THE MOST INTELLIGENT AND FARSEEING TYPES THE DESIRE JUST POINTS TO GLOWING SATISFACTIONS AND ILLUSIONS QUITE EQUALLY I THINK THE DESIRE OF THE FEMALE FOR THE MALE IGNORES ITS END NATURE HAS SET ABOUT THIS BUSINESS IN A
6773-76039-0045 CHEAP SORT OF WAY SHE IS LIKE SOME PUSHFUL ADVERTISING TRADESMAN SHE ISN'T FRANK WITH US SHE JUST HUMBUGS US INTO WHAT SHE WANTS WITH US
6773-76039-0046 ALL VERY WELL IN THE EARLY STONE AGE WHEN THE POOR DEAR THINGS NEVER REALIZED THAT THEIR MUTUAL ENDEARMENTS MEANT ALL THE TROUBLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARENTAGE BUT NOW
6773-76039-0047 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SIDEWAYS AND TWIRLED THE GREEN UMBRELLA LIKE AN ANIMATED HALO AROUND HIS LARGE BROAD MINDED FACE SIR RICHMOND CONSIDERED DESIRE HAS NEVER BEEN THE CHIEF INCENTIVE OF MY RELATIONS WITH WOMEN NEVER
6773-76039-0048 SO FAR AS I CAN ANALYZE THE THING IT HAS BEEN A CRAVING FOR A PARTICULAR SORT OF LIFE GIVING COMPANIONSHIP THAT I TAKE IT IS NATURE'S DEVICE TO KEEP THE LOVERS TOGETHER IN THE INTEREST OF THE MORE OR LESS UNPREMEDITATED OFFSPRING
6773-76039-0049 A POOR DEVICE IF THAT IS ITS END IT DOESN'T KEEP PARENTS TOGETHER MORE OFTEN IT TEARS THEM APART
6773-76039-0050 BECOMES ALL TOO MANIFESTLY NOT THE COMPANION GODDESS SIR RICHMOND BROODED OVER HIS SCULLS AND THOUGHT THROUGHOUT MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN AN EXCEEDINGLY BUSY MAN I HAVE DONE A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC WORK AND SOME OF IT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD WORK AND VERY LABORIOUS WORK
6773-76039-0051 I'VE TRAVELLED MUCH I'VE ORGANIZED GREAT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS YOU MIGHT THINK THAT MY TIME HAS BEEN FAIRLY WELL FILLED WITHOUT MUCH PHILANDERING AND ALL THE TIME ALL THE TIME I'VE BEEN ABOUT WOMEN LIKE A THIRSTY BEAST LOOKING FOR WATER ALWAYS ALWAYS
6773-76039-0052 ALL THROUGH MY LIFE DOCTOR MARTINEAU WAITED THROUGH ANOTHER SILENCE I WAS VERY GRAVE ABOUT IT AT FIRST I MARRIED YOUNG I MARRIED VERY SIMPLY AND PURELY I WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE YOUNG MEN WHO SOW A LARGE CROP OF WILD OATS
6773-76039-0053 I WAS A FAIRLY DECENT YOUTH IT SUDDENLY APPEARED TO ME THAT A CERTAIN SMILING AND DAINTY GIRL COULD MAKE HERSELF INTO ALL THE GODDESSES OF MY DREAMS I HAD BUT TO WIN HER AND THIS MIRACLE WOULD OCCUR OF COURSE I FORGET NOW THE EXACT THINGS I THOUGHT AND FELT THEN
6773-76039-0054 BUT SURELY I HAD SOME SUCH PERSUASION OR WHY SHOULD I HAVE MARRIED HER MY WIFE WAS SEVEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN MYSELF A GIRL OF TWENTY SHE WAS CHARMING SHE IS CHARMING SHE IS A WONDERFULLY INTELLIGENT AND UNDERSTANDING WOMAN
6773-76039-0055 I OWE MY HOME AND ALL THE COMFORT AND DIGNITY OF MY LIFE TO HER ABILITY I HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR ANY MISBEHAVIOUR SO FAR AS SHE IS CONCERNED NONE AT ALL BY ALL THE RULES I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY HAPPY
6773-76039-0056 BUT INSTEAD OF MY MARRIAGE SATISFYING ME IT PRESENTLY RELEASED A STORM OF LONG CONTROLLED DESIRES AND IMPRISONED CRAVINGS A VOICE WITHIN ME BECAME MORE AND MORE URGENT THIS WILL NOT DO THIS IS NOT LOVE WHERE ARE YOUR GODDESSES THIS IS NOT LOVE
6773-76039-0057 AND I WAS UNFAITHFUL TO MY WIFE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF MY MARRIAGE IT WAS A SUDDEN OVERPOWERING IMPULSE
6773-76039-0058 I FORGET NOW ALL THE EMOTIONS OF THAT ADVENTURE I SUPPOSE AT THE TIME IT SEEMED BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL I DO NOT EXCUSE MYSELF STILL LESS DO I CONDEMN MYSELF I PUT THE FACTS BEFORE YOU SO IT WAS THERE WERE NO CHILDREN BY YOUR MARRIAGE
6773-76039-0059 YOUR LINE OF THOUGHT DOCTOR IS TOO PHILOPROGENITIVE WE HAVE HAD THREE MY DAUGHTER WAS MARRIED TWO YEARS AGO SHE IS IN AMERICA ONE LITTLE BOY DIED WHEN HE WAS THREE THE OTHER IS IN INDIA TAKING UP THE MARDIPORE POWER SCHEME AGAIN NOW THAT HE IS OUT OF THE ARMY
6773-76039-0060 NO IT IS SIMPLY THAT I WAS HOPELESSLY DISAPPOINTED WITH EVERYTHING THAT A GOOD WOMAN AND A DECENT MARRIAGE HAD TO GIVE ME PURE DISAPPOINTMENT AND VEXATION THE ANTI CLIMAX TO AN IMMENSE EXPECTATION BUILT UP THROUGHOUT AN IMAGINATIVE BOYHOOD AND YOUTH AND EARLY MANHOOD
6773-76039-0061 I WAS SHOCKED AND ASHAMED AT MY OWN DISAPPOINTMENT I THOUGHT IT MEAN AND BASE NEVERTHELESS THIS ORDERLY HOUSEHOLD INTO WHICH I HAD PLACED MY LIFE THESE ALMOST METHODICAL CONNUBIALITIES HE BROKE OFF IN MID SENTENCE
6773-76039-0062 DOCTOR MARTINEAU SHOOK HIS HEAD DISAPPROVINGLY NO HE SAID IT WASN'T FAIR TO YOUR WIFE IT WAS SHOCKINGLY UNFAIR I HAVE ALWAYS REALIZED THAT I'VE DONE WHAT I COULD TO MAKE THINGS UP TO HER HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT COUNTER DISAPPOINTMENTS SHE HAS CONCEALED
6773-76039-0063 BUT IT IS NO GOOD ARGUING ABOUT RIGHTS AND WRONGS NOW THIS IS NOT AN APOLOGY FOR MY LIFE I AM TELLING YOU WHAT HAPPENED NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU GO ON BY MARRYING I HAD GOT NOTHING THAT MY SOUL CRAVED FOR
6773-76039-0064 I HAD SATISFIED NONE BUT THE MOST TRANSITORY DESIRES AND I HAD INCURRED A TREMENDOUS OBLIGATION THAT OBLIGATION DIDN'T RESTRAIN ME FROM MAKING DESPERATE LUNGES AT SOMETHING VAGUELY BEAUTIFUL THAT I FELT WAS NECESSARY TO ME
6773-76039-0065 BUT IT DID CRAMP AND LIMIT THESE LUNGES SO MY STORY FLOPS DOWN INTO THE COMEDY OF THE LYING CRAMPED INTRIGUES OF A RESPECTABLE MARRIED MAN I WAS STILL DRIVEN BY MY DREAM OF SOME EXTRAVAGANTLY BEAUTIFUL INSPIRATION CALLED LOVE
6773-76039-0066 AND I SOUGHT IT LIKE AN AREA SNEAK GODS WHAT A STORY IT IS WHEN ONE BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THE GLOW AND SWEETNESS I DREAMT OF WERE NOT IN THE WORLD SOMEWHERE HIDDEN AWAY FROM ME
6773-76039-0067 NOW IN A SLIM FORM SEEN AGAINST THE SKY OFTEN I CARED NOTHING FOR THE WOMAN I MADE LOVE TO I CARED FOR THE THING SHE SEEMED TO BE HIDING FROM ME SIR RICHMOND'S VOICE ALTERED
6773-76039-0068 I DON'T SEE WHAT POSSIBLE GOOD IT CAN DO TO TALK OVER THESE THINGS HE BEGAN TO ROW AND ROWED PERHAPS A SCORE OF STROKES THEN HE STOPPED AND THE BOAT DROVE ON WITH A WHISPER OF WATER AT THE BOW AND OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED OAR BLADES
6773-76039-0069 WHAT A MUDDLE AND MOCKERY THE WHOLE THING IS HE CRIED WHAT A FUMBLING OLD FOOL OLD MOTHER NATURE HAS BEEN SHE DRIVES US INTO INDIGNITY AND DISHONOUR AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN GET THE CHILDREN WHICH ARE HER ONLY EXCUSE FOR HER MISCHIEF
6773-76039-0070 SEE WHAT A FANTASTIC THING I AM WHEN YOU TAKE THE MACHINE TO PIECES I HAVE BEEN A BUSY AND RESPONSIBLE MAN THROUGHOUT MY LIFE I HAVE HANDLED COMPLICATED PUBLIC AND INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRS NOT UNSUCCESSFULLY AND DISCHARGED QUITE BIG OBLIGATIONS FULLY AND FAITHFULLY
6773-76039-0071 AND ALL THE TIME HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC EYE MY LIFE HAS BEEN LACED BY THE THREAD OF THESE
6773-76039-0072 WHAT CAN ONE CALL THEM LOVE ADVENTURES HOW MANY YOU ASK I DON'T KNOW NEVER HAVE I BEEN A WHOLE HEARTED LOVER NEVER HAVE I BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE LOVE ALONE NEVER HAS LOVE LEFT ME ALONE AND AS I AM MADE SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH SUDDEN INSISTENCE
6773-76039-0073 AS I AM MADE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I COULD GO ON WITHOUT THESE AFFAIRS I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE DISPOSED TO DISPUTE THAT DOCTOR MARTINEAU MADE A REASSURING NOISE THESE AFFAIRS ARE AT ONCE UNSATISFYING AND VITALLY NECESSARY
6773-76039-0074 IT IS ONLY LATTERLY THAT I HAVE BEGUN TO PERCEIVE THIS WOMEN MAKE LIFE FOR ME WHATEVER THEY TOUCH OR SEE OR DESIRE BECOMES WORTH WHILE AND OTHERWISE IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE WHATEVER IS LOVELY IN MY WORLD WHATEVER IS DELIGHTFUL HAS BEEN SO CONVEYED TO ME BY SOME WOMAN
6773-76039-0075 WITHOUT THE VISION THEY GIVE ME I SHOULD BE A HARD DRY INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD A WORKER ANT A SOULLESS RAGE MAKING MUCH VALUING NOTHING HE PAUSED YOU ARE I THINK ABNORMAL
6773-76039-0076 CONSIDERED THE DOCTOR NOT ABNORMAL EXCESSIVE IF YOU LIKE WITHOUT WOMEN I AM A WASTING FEVER OF DISTRESSFUL TOIL WITHOUT THEM THERE IS NO KINDNESS IN EXISTENCE NO REST NO SORT OF SATISFACTION
6773-76039-0077 LOGICAL NECESSITY AND UTTER DESOLATION WITH NOTHING WHATEVER WORTH FIGHTING FOR WHATEVER JUSTIFIES EFFORT WHATEVER RESTORES ENERGY IS HIDDEN IN WOMEN AN ACCESS OF SEX SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU
6773-76039-0078 THIS IS A PHASE IT IS HOW I AM MADE SAID SIR RICHMOND A BRIEF SILENCE FELL UPON THAT DOCTOR MARTINEAU PERSISTED
