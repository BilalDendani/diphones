56-1732-0000 WHEN HE WAS DRESSED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SPRINKLED SOME SCENT ON HIMSELF PULLED DOWN HIS SHIRT CUFFS DISTRIBUTED INTO HIS POCKETS HIS CIGARETTES POCKETBOOK MATCHES AND WATCH WITH ITS DOUBLE CHAIN AND SEALS AND SHAKING OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF
56-1732-0001 FEELING HIMSELF CLEAN FRAGRANT HEALTHY AND PHYSICALLY AT EASE IN SPITE OF HIS UNHAPPINESS HE WALKED WITH A SLIGHT SWING ON EACH LEG INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE COFFEE WAS ALREADY WAITING FOR HIM AND BESIDE THE COFFEE LETTERS AND PAPERS FROM THE OFFICE
56-1732-0002 HE READ THE LETTERS ONE WAS VERY UNPLEASANT FROM A MERCHANT WHO WAS BUYING A FOREST ON HIS WIFE'S PROPERTY TO SELL THIS FOREST WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL BUT AT PRESENT UNTIL HE WAS RECONCILED WITH HIS WIFE THE SUBJECT COULD NOT BE DISCUSSED
56-1732-0003 THE MOST UNPLEASANT THING OF ALL WAS THAT HIS PECUNIARY INTERESTS SHOULD IN THIS WAY ENTER INTO THE QUESTION OF HIS RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE AND THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE LED ON BY HIS INTERESTS THAT HE MIGHT SEEK A RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SALE OF THE FOREST THAT IDEA HURT HIM
56-1732-0004 WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS LETTERS STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH MOVED THE OFFICE PAPERS CLOSE TO HIM RAPIDLY LOOKED THROUGH TWO PIECES OF BUSINESS MADE A FEW NOTES WITH A BIG PENCIL AND PUSHING AWAY THE PAPERS TURNED TO HIS COFFEE AS HE SIPPED HIS COFFEE HE OPENED A STILL DAMP MORNING PAPER
56-1732-0005 AND BEGAN READING IT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TOOK IN AND READ A LIBERAL PAPER NOT AN EXTREME ONE BUT ONE ADVOCATING THE VIEWS HELD BY THE MAJORITY AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT SCIENCE ART AND POLITICS HAD NO SPECIAL INTEREST FOR HIM
56-1732-0006 HE FIRMLY HELD THOSE VIEWS ON ALL THESE SUBJECTS WHICH WERE HELD BY THE MAJORITY AND BY HIS PAPER AND HE ONLY CHANGED THEM WHEN THE MAJORITY CHANGED THEM OR MORE STRICTLY SPEAKING HE DID NOT CHANGE THEM BUT THEY IMPERCEPTIBLY CHANGED OF THEMSELVES WITHIN HIM
56-1732-0007 STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HAD NOT CHOSEN HIS POLITICAL OPINIONS OR HIS VIEWS THESE POLITICAL OPINIONS AND VIEWS HAD COME TO HIM OF THEMSELVES JUST AS HE DID NOT CHOOSE THE SHAPES OF HIS HAT AND COAT BUT SIMPLY TOOK THOSE THAT WERE BEING WORN AND FOR HIM
56-1732-0008 LIVING IN A CERTAIN SOCIETY OWING TO THE NEED ORDINARILY DEVELOPED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION FOR SOME DEGREE OF MENTAL ACTIVITY TO HAVE VIEWS WAS JUST AS INDISPENSABLE AS TO HAVE A HAT IF THERE WAS A REASON FOR HIS PREFERRING LIBERAL TO CONSERVATIVE VIEWS
56-1732-0009 WHICH WERE HELD ALSO BY MANY OF HIS CIRCLE IT AROSE NOT FROM HIS CONSIDERING LIBERALISM MORE RATIONAL BUT FROM ITS BEING IN CLOSER ACCORDANCE WITH HIS MANNER OF LIFE THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT IN RUSSIA EVERYTHING IS WRONG
56-1732-0010 AND CERTAINLY STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HAD MANY DEBTS AND WAS DECIDEDLY SHORT OF MONEY THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT MARRIAGE IS AN INSTITUTION QUITE OUT OF DATE AND THAT IT NEEDS RECONSTRUCTION AND FAMILY LIFE CERTAINLY AFFORDED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH LITTLE GRATIFICATION
56-1732-0011 AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD NOT GET THROUGH EVEN A SHORT SERVICE WITHOUT HIS LEGS ACHING FROM STANDING UP AND COULD NEVER MAKE OUT WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF ALL THE TERRIBLE AND HIGH FLOWN LANGUAGE ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD WHEN LIFE MIGHT BE SO VERY AMUSING IN THIS WORLD AND WITH ALL THIS
56-1732-0012 AND HE LIKED HIS NEWSPAPER AS HE DID HIS CIGAR AFTER DINNER FOR THE SLIGHT FOG IT DIFFUSED IN HIS BRAIN HE READ THE LEADING ARTICLE IN WHICH IT WAS MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN OUR DAY TO RAISE AN OUTCRY THAT RADICALISM WAS THREATENING TO SWALLOW UP ALL CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS
56-1732-0013 AND DROPPED SOME INNUENDOES REFLECTING ON THE MINISTRY WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC QUICKWITTEDNESS HE CAUGHT THE DRIFT OF EACH INNUENDO DIVINED WHENCE IT CAME AT WHOM AND ON WHAT GROUND IT WAS AIMED AND THAT AFFORDED HIM AS IT ALWAYS DID A CERTAIN SATISFACTION
56-1732-0014 BUT TODAY THAT SATISFACTION WAS EMBITTERED BY MATRONA PHILIMONOVNA'S ADVICE AND THE UNSATISFACTORY STATE OF THE HOUSEHOLD
56-1732-0015 AND THAT ONE NEED HAVE NO MORE GRAY HAIR AND OF THE SALE OF A LIGHT CARRIAGE AND OF A YOUNG PERSON SEEKING A SITUATION BUT THESE ITEMS OF INFORMATION DID NOT GIVE HIM AS USUAL A QUIET IRONICAL GRATIFICATION
56-1732-0016 HAVING FINISHED THE PAPER A SECOND CUP OF COFFEE AND A ROLL AND BUTTER HE GOT UP SHAKING THE CRUMBS OF THE ROLL OFF HIS WAISTCOAT AND SQUARING HIS BROAD CHEST HE SMILED JOYOUSLY NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS ANYTHING PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE IN HIS MIND
56-1732-0017 THE JOYOUS SMILE WAS EVOKED BY A GOOD DIGESTION BUT THIS JOYOUS SMILE AT ONCE RECALLED EVERYTHING TO HIM AND HE GREW THOUGHTFUL TWO CHILDISH VOICES STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH RECOGNIZED THE VOICES OF GRISHA HIS YOUNGEST BOY AND TANYA HIS ELDEST GIRL
56-1732-0018 WERE HEARD OUTSIDE THE DOOR THEY WERE CARRYING SOMETHING AND DROPPED IT I TOLD YOU NOT TO SIT PASSENGERS ON THE ROOF SAID THE LITTLE GIRL IN ENGLISH THERE PICK THEM UP EVERYTHING'S IN CONFUSION THOUGHT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH THERE ARE THE CHILDREN RUNNING ABOUT BY THEMSELVES
56-1732-0019 AND GOING TO THE DOOR HE CALLED THEM THEY THREW DOWN THE BOX THAT REPRESENTED A TRAIN AND CAME IN TO THEIR FATHER THE LITTLE GIRL HER FATHER'S FAVORITE RAN UP BOLDLY EMBRACED HIM AND HUNG LAUGHINGLY ON HIS NECK
56-1732-0020 ENJOYING AS SHE ALWAYS DID THE SMELL OF SCENT THAT CAME FROM HIS WHISKERS AT LAST THE LITTLE GIRL KISSED HIS FACE WHICH WAS FLUSHED FROM HIS STOOPING POSTURE AND BEAMING WITH TENDERNESS LOOSED HER HANDS AND WAS ABOUT TO RUN AWAY AGAIN BUT HER FATHER HELD HER BACK
56-1732-0021 HOW IS MAMMA HE ASKED PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS DAUGHTER'S SMOOTH SOFT LITTLE NECK GOOD MORNING HE SAID SMILING TO THE BOY WHO HAD COME UP TO GREET HIM HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE LOVED THE BOY LESS AND ALWAYS TRIED TO BE FAIR BUT THE BOY FELT IT
56-1732-0022 HE AT ONCE PERCEIVED IT AND BLUSHED TOO I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID SHE DID NOT SAY WE MUST DO OUR LESSONS BUT SHE SAID WE WERE TO GO FOR A WALK WITH MISS HOOLE TO GRANDMAMMA'S WELL GO TANYA MY DARLING OH WAIT A MINUTE THOUGH HE SAID
56-1732-0023 STILL HOLDING HER AND STROKING HER SOFT LITTLE HAND HE TOOK OFF THE MANTELPIECE WHERE HE HAD PUT IT YESTERDAY A LITTLE BOX OF SWEETS AND GAVE HER TWO PICKING OUT HER FAVORITES A CHOCOLATE AND A FONDANT FOR GRISHA
56-1732-0024 SAID THE LITTLE GIRL POINTING TO THE CHOCOLATE YES YES
56-1732-0025 AND LET HER GO THE CARRIAGE IS READY SAID MATVEY BUT THERE'S SOME ONE TO SEE YOU WITH A PETITION BEEN HERE LONG ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HALF AN HOUR HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU TO TELL ME AT ONCE
56-1732-0026 THE WIDOW OF A STAFF CAPTAIN KALININ CAME WITH A REQUEST IMPOSSIBLE AND UNREASONABLE BUT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS HE GENERALLY DID MADE HER SIT DOWN HEARD HER TO THE END ATTENTIVELY WITHOUT INTERRUPTING HER AND GAVE HER DETAILED ADVICE AS TO HOW AND TO WHOM TO APPLY
56-1732-0027 AND EVEN WROTE HER IN HIS LARGE SPRAWLING GOOD AND LEGIBLE HAND A CONFIDENT AND FLUENT LITTLE NOTE TO A PERSONAGE WHO MIGHT BE OF USE TO HER HAVING GOT RID OF THE STAFF CAPTAIN'S WIDOW STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TOOK HIS HAT AND STOPPED TO RECOLLECT WHETHER HE HAD FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
56-1732-0028 IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT HE WANTED TO FORGET HIS WIFE AH YES HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND HIS HANDSOME FACE ASSUMED A HARASSED EXPRESSION TO GO OR NOT TO GO HE SAID TO HIMSELF
56-1732-0029 THAT NOTHING COULD COME OF IT BUT FALSITY THAT TO AMEND TO SET RIGHT THEIR RELATIONS WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HER ATTRACTIVE AGAIN AND ABLE TO INSPIRE LOVE OR TO MAKE HIM AN OLD MAN NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOVE EXCEPT DECEIT AND LYING NOTHING COULD COME OF IT NOW
56-1732-0030 AND DECEIT AND LYING WERE OPPOSED TO HIS NATURE IT MUST BE SOME TIME THOUGH IT CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS HE SAID TRYING TO GIVE HIMSELF COURAGE
