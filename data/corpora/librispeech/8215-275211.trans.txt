8215-275211-0001 WHEN A SHOVEL OR A PITCHFORK HANDLE SNAPS SUDDENLY OR AN AXE HELVE OR A RAKE'S TAIL BREAKS OFF UNDER NO GREAT STRAIN THE FARMER SAYS TWAS POWDER POST IF THIS SMALL PEST OBTAINS LODGMENT IN A BARN
8215-275211-0002 OR IN THE OAK FINISH OR FURNITURE OF A HOUSE IT IS LIKELY TO DO A VEXATIOUS AMOUNT OF DAMAGE AND NO PRACTICABLE METHOD OF CHECKING ITS RAVAGES HAS BEEN FOUND VARNISHES DO NOT EXCLUDE IT BOILING WILL KILL THE BORER BUT FURNITURE AND WAINSCOTINGS ARE NOT EASILY BOILED
8215-275211-0003 FROM THE FRAMES OF OLD BUILDINGS WHEN OF OAK POWDER POST WILL SOMETIMES RUN IN STREAMS WHEN A BEAM OR BRACE IS STRUCK BUT EVERYTHING HAS ITS VIRTUES IF ONLY THEY CAN BE FOUND OUT AND LONG AGO IN NEW ENGLAND
8215-275211-0004 SOME RUSTIC A ESCULAPIUS DISCOVERED THAT POWDER POST WAS A SOVEREIGN BALM FOR ALL FLESH WOUNDS CAUSING THEM TO HEAL RAPIDLY WITHOUT PROUD FLESH AND IF PROUD FLESH APPEARED
8215-275211-0005 WHAT MODERN MEDICAL SCIENCE WOULD PREDICATE CONCERNING THIS PANACEA I KNOW NOT BUT THOUSANDS OF CUTS IN RURAL DISTRICTS TREATED WITH POWDER POST DID VERY WELL AND FAITH IN IT WAXED STRONG SO WHEN SAM EASTMAN CUT HIS FOOT OVER IN THE EAST WOODS
8215-275211-0006 ALL THE WISEACRES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD DECLARED THAT THAT FOOT MUST BE DONE UP IN POWDER POST IF IT ISN'T THEY SAID PROUD FLESH WILL GET INTO IT AND THAT BOY WILL BE LAME ALL WINTER IT WAS A BAD CUT
8215-275211-0007 SAM AND WILLIS MURCH HAD BEEN SPLITTING FOUR FOOT LOGS WHEN SAM'S AXE GLANCING FROM A LOG HAD BURIED THE BLADE IN HIS INSTEP THE VERY BONES WERE CUT THERE WERE FOUR OF US BOYS AT WORK TOGETHER WE RAN TO HIM TIED A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS ANKLE
8215-275211-0008 AND TWISTED IT TIGHT WITH A STICK BUT BLOOD FLOWED PROFUSELY WE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO APPLY A TOURNIQUET
8215-275211-0009 AND ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ALL THE NEIGHBORS WE COULD NOT COLLECT ENOUGH POWDER POST TO DRESS THE CUT SEVERAL PEOPLE SAID HOWEVER
8215-275211-0010 THE BRACES OF THAT BARN HAD BEEN MADE OF CLEFT RED OAK
8215-275211-0011 AND HAD LIVED THERE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS ILL FORTUNE BESET HIM HOWEVER
8215-275211-0012 ABANDONING THE PROPERTY THE CLEARING WAS KNOWN TO ALL THE BOYS OF THE LOCALITY AS A FAVORITE HAUNT OF FOXES THE NEXT MORNING SAM'S YOUNGER BROTHER JOHN WILLIS MURCH AND I
8215-275211-0013 JOHN HAD A SMALL AXE WITH WHICH TO SPLIT THE TIMBERS FOUR OLD NEWSPAPERS IN WHICH TO GATHER UP THE PRECIOUS DUST AND A BOTTLE IN WHICH TO PUT IT IT WAS THANKSGIVING MORNING THE SUN ROSE IN A CLEAR STRAW COLORED SKY
8215-275211-0014 IT WAS COLD THE GROUND WAS FROZEN AND THERE WAS SKATING ON THE SMALL PONDS
8215-275211-0015 THIS IS A WEATHER BREEDER GRANDMOTHER REMARKED AT BREAKFAST
8215-275211-0016 WAS A LINE OF SLATE GRAY CLOUD
8215-275211-0017 FOR WILLIS OWNED A GUN AN OLD ARMY RIFLE BORED OUT SMOOTH FOR SHOT OUR ONLY ANXIETY WAS TO GET BACK IN GOOD SEASON FOR DINNER THANKSGIVING DINNER WAS ALWAYS AT THREE O'CLOCK WE SET OFF IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST
8215-275211-0018 THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HASTE ON SAM'S ACCOUNT FOR JOHN TOLD US THAT THE CUT FOOT WAS NO LONGER VERY PAINFUL AND SAM HAD SLEPT WELL THE DISTANCE WAS ABOUT FOUR MILES
8215-275211-0019 AND NO LONGER RUSTLED UNDERFOOT RED AND GRAY SQUIRRELS SCAMPERED ACROSS OUR PATH BUT WILLIS DISDAINED TO FIRE AT THEM HE WAS LOADED FOR DEER BESIDES HE HAD BUT THREE EXTRA CHARGES POWDER AND SHOT WERE USUALLY SCARCE WITH US
8215-275211-0020 AT LENGTH WE HEARD A DEER RUN AND FOLLOWED IT FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THEN JOHN ESPIED A HEDGEHOG IN A POPLAR TREE AND WILLIS SHOT IT THE LONG BLACK POINTED QUILLS WERE A CURIOSITY TO US BUT WE DID NOT DEEM SUCH GAME WORTH CARRYING HOME
8215-275211-0021 SEVERAL OF THEM WERE FINE FISH THAT LOOKED AS IF THEY MIGHT WEIGH A POUND OR MORE I HAD HEARD OLDER BOYS SAY THAT IF A GUN IS FIRED WITH THE MUZZLE HELD JUST THROUGH THE ICE OF A FROZEN POOL THE CONCUSSION WILL SO STUN THE FISH BENEATH THAT THEY WILL FLOAT UP
8215-275211-0022 TO THE UNDER SIDE OF THE ICE WILLIS WAS AFRAID THAT THIS WOULD BURST HIS GUN BUT THE TROUT LOOKED SO ALLURING THAT AT LAST HE VENTURED THE EXPERIMENT JOHN CUT A SMALL HOLE WITH THE AXE AND THEN WILLIS LYING DOWN THRUST THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN ABOUT SIX INCHES BENEATH THE ICE
8215-275211-0023 THEN HE EDGED AWAY AND STRETCHING OUT HIS ARM AT FULL LENGTH PULLED THE TRIGGER THE GUN RECOILED BUT NO APPARENT DAMAGE WAS DONE FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE WATER WAS TURBID WITH THE SMOKE BUT WHEN IT CLEARED THERE SURE ENOUGH WERE FIVE OR SIX OF THE VERY LARGEST TROUT FLOATING BELLY UPWARD AGAINST THE ICE
8215-275211-0024 WE SOON CAME TO ONE MUCH DEEPER AND BETTER STOCKED WITH TROUT AND WILLIS FIRED UNDER THE ICE AGAIN EIGHT FISH WERE SECURED HERE
8215-275211-0025 THIS TIME WILLIS THRUST THE GUN DEEPER INTO THE WATER WITH THE RESULT THAT ABOUT A FOOT OF THE MUZZLE WAS SPLIT OPEN WE HAD ANGRY WORDS ABOUT THIS ACCIDENT FOR WILLIS MUCH CHAPFALLEN OVER THE MISHAP BLAMED ME AND DECLARED THAT I OUGHT TO BUY HIM A NEW GUN
8215-275211-0026 HE THEN SEIZED ALL THE TROUT
8215-275211-0027 AND HE AND I TURNED OUR BACKS ON WILLIS AND HIT UPON A STRATAGEM FOR CAPTURING TROUT ON OUR OWN ACCOUNT KNOWING THAT IT WAS THE CONCUSSION OF THE SHOT THAT STUNNED THE TROUT WE WENT UP TO THE OLD BARN AND PROCURED A LONG SWEEPING BOARD USING THIS LIKE A FLAIL WE COULD STRIKE THE ICE A BLOW
8215-275211-0028 THAT MADE A NOISE WELL NIGH AS LOUD AS A GUN WHEN WE GAVE JUST THE RIGHT SORT OF BLOW THE TROUT BELOW WOULD TURN ON THEIR BACKS AND FLOAT UP TO THE ICE JOHN AND I SOON SECURED TWO GOOD STRINGS OF TROUT AND BY THIS TIME WILLIS
8215-275211-0029 THOUGHT IT BEST TO MAKE PEACE COME ON BOYS HE EXCLAIMED
8215-275211-0030 WILLIS AND I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HURRY THEN SAID WILLIS OR WE SHALL BE LATE TO THANKSGIVING DINNER I'M HUNGRY NOW WE RAN TO THE BARN THE LEAN TO DOOR WAS OFF ITS HINGES BUT WOODEN PINS HELD THE OAK BRACES OF THE FRAME IN POSITION WE KNOCKED OUT THE PINS
8215-275211-0031 AND ANOTHER BRACE HAD TO BE TAKEN OUT AND SPLIT BY THIS TIME OUR NEWSPAPERS WERE TORN IN PIECES AND ALTOGETHER WE HAD MUCH TROUBLE IN COLLECTING HALF A BOTTLEFUL WHEN AT LAST WE CORKED UP THE BOTTLE AND HURRIED OUT OF THE BARN A HEAVY SNOWSTORM HAD SET IN
8215-275211-0032 WE COULD NOT EVEN SEE THE FOREST ACROSS THE CLEARING
8215-275211-0033 SO I THINK REPLIED WILLIS STOPPING TO LOOK ABOUT I THINK WE'RE HEADING OFF TOO FAR TOWARD STOSS POND SAID I OH NO WE'RE NOT CRIED WILLIS COME ON
8215-275211-0034 GRIPPING OUR STRINGS OF FISH WE RAN ON AGAIN BUT PRESENTLY WE WERE PERPLEXED TO DISCERN THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN LOOKING UP DIRECTLY AHEAD THERE NOW
8215-275211-0035 WE DIDN'T CROSS ANY SUCH BROOK AS THIS ON OUR WAY UP JOHN EXCLAIMED WE'RE AWAY DOWN ON STOSS POND BROOK SAID WILLIS WE'VE COME WRONG IF YOU BOTH THINK YOU KNOW MORE THAN I KEEP ON I'M GOING IN THIS OTHER DIRECTION AND WILLIS SET OFF TO RUN AGAIN
8215-275211-0036 JOHN AND I FOLLOWED HIM IN THE COURSE OF FIVE MINUTES WE CAME SUDDENLY OUT INTO CLEARED LAND
8215-275211-0037 JOHN AND I WERE TOO MUCH GRATIFIED TO QUESTION WILLIS'S SUPERIOR WISDOM AND FOLLOWED AFTER HIM INTENT ONLY ON GETTING HOME TO DINNER THE STORM WAS NOW DRIVING THICK AND FAST WE COULD NOT SEE A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD BUT WE SEEMED TO BE ON LEVEL GROUND
8215-275211-0038 SUCH AS I HAD NEVER SEEN IN NEIGHBOR WILBUR'S PASTURE SOON WE CAME TO ANOTHER LARGE BROOK
8215-275211-0039 STOPPING SHORT I DON'T CARE CRIED WILLIS THIS MUST BE WILBUR'S PASTURE
8215-275211-0040 OF COURSE IT IS HE SHOUTED BACK TO US FOR THERE'S WILBUR'S BARN RIGHT AHEAD OF US WE HASTENED AFTER WILLIS PLODDING THROUGH DRY SNOWY GRASS AND CAME TO A BARN ABOUT WHICH THE STORM EDDIED IN SNOWY GUSTS BUT WHERE'S WILBUR'S HOUSE ASKED JOHN WE LOOKED ROUND IN PERPLEXITY
8215-275211-0041 THERE WAS NO HOUSE IN SIGHT BUT HERE WAS A BARN AND THE DOOR WAS AJAR WE WENT IN IT WAS EMPTY OF HAY OR CATTLE
8215-275211-0042 WE HAD RUN FIVE MILES THROUGH THE WOODS ONLY TO REACH THE PLACE FROM WHICH WE HAD STARTED JOHN LOOKED AT ME AND I LOOKED AT WILLIS A SENSE OF UTTER BEWILDERMENT FELL ON US JOHN AND I DID NOT EVEN THINK TO REVILE WILLIS IN FACT WE WERE TERRIFIED
8215-275211-0043 ALL HOPE OF DINNER OR OF REACHING HOME AT ALL THAT NIGHT DESERTED US THE STORM WAS INCREASING THE LATE NOVEMBER DAY WAS AT AN END FOR A WHILE WE SCARCELY SPOKE JOHN EASTMAN WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST BEGAN TO CRY
8215-275211-0044 THE OLD BARN CREAKED DISMALLY AS EACH GUST OF WIND RACKED IT AND LOOSE BOARDS RATTLED AND BANGED NO CREATED PLACE CAN BE MORE DREARY THAN AN OLD AND EMPTY BARN
8215-275211-0045 WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED BUILD A FIRE IN THE BARN EVEN IF WE HAD HAD MATCHES WILLIS GROPED ABOUT IN THE OLD HAY BAY AND GATHERED A FEW HANDFULS OF MUSTY HAY
8215-275211-0046 BUT NOTHING THAT WE COULD DO SUFFICED TO WARM US AND WE LAY SHIVERING FOR WHAT SEEMED HOURS JOHN AND I FINALLY FELL ASLEEP AND PERHAPS WILLIS DID ALSO ALTHOUGH HE ALWAYS DENIED IT AT LAST HE WAKED US SHAKING US VIOLENTLY YOU MUSTN'T SLEEP HE EXCLAIMED
8215-275211-0047 OUR TOES AND FINGERS ACHED A FINE DUST OF SNOW SIFTED DOWN ON OUR FACES AND HOW THAT OLD BARN DID CREAK A GALE WAS RAGING
8215-275211-0048 THERE'S ALMOST ALWAYS OLD DRY STUFF UNDER A BARN FLOOR
8215-275211-0049 YES LET'S DO IT QUAVERED JOHN IF WE GET UNDER THE FLOOR THE BARN WON'T KILL US MAYBE IF IT BLOWS DOWN WILLIS CREPT TO THE ENDS OF THE FLOOR PLANKS NEXT THE LEAN TO AND TRIED FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER SOON HE FOUND ONE THAT COULD BE RAISED AND TIPPED IT OVER
8215-275211-0050 MAKING AN APERTURE LARGE ENOUGH TO DESCEND THROUGH IT WAS POKERISH MOVING ABOUT IN THE DARK BUT WE THRUST DOWN OUR LEGS AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS DRY CHAFF AND HAY THERE WILLIS LET HIMSELF DOWN AND FELT AROUND AND THEN BADE US GET DOWN BESIDE HIM
8215-275211-0051 IT SEEMED SAFER DOWN THERE AND WE FELT THE WIND LESS BUT LAY LISTENING TO THE GUSTS
8215-275211-0052 JOHN WHO WAS IN THE MIDDLE FELT WARM AS A KITTEN I WAS BUT HALF AWAKE AND SO COLD THAT I SELFISHLY CREPT OVER BETWEEN HIM AND WILLIS THAT WAKED JOHN
8215-275211-0053 WHO WAKED IN A BAD TEMPER WHAT YOU DOING HE SNARLED GETTING THE WARM CHAFF ALL AWAY FROM MY BACK
8215-275211-0054 YOUR MOUTH ISN'T WITH IT IS IT WILLIS DID NOT REPLY HE WAS FALLING ASLEEP AGAIN SAY WILLIS HAS YOUR MOUTH GOT STRAYED AWAY FROM YOUR HEAD SAID JOHN IS THAT YOUR HEAD HE EXCLAIMED A MOMENT AFTER SPEAKING TO ME KEEP STILL CAN'T YOU I GROWLED
8215-275211-0055 WELL BY GUMMY IT ISN'T HIS HEAD EITHER CRIED JOHN WHOSE HEAD IS THAT OVER THERE YOU LIE DOWN JOHN SAID WILLIS
8215-275211-0056 HE SCRAMBLED BACK OVER US BOTH THE SPACE WAS ALL TOO NARROW FOR SUCH A MANEUVRE AND HIS KNEES FELT HARD NOW LOOK HERE SAID WILLIS YOU QUIT THAT BUT JOHN WAS CLIMBING THROUGH THE HOLE TO THE BARN FLOOR ABOVE YOU MUST GET OUT OF THERE HE CRIED THERE IS SOMETHING DOWN THERE
8215-275211-0057 BY THIS TIME WILLIS WAS FULLY WAKED UP HE REACHED OVER WITH HIS HAND ON THE SIDE WHERE JOHN HAD BEEN AND THEN HE TOO GAVE A SPRING AND CLIMBED OUT ON THE FLOOR
8215-275211-0058 HE'S GOT AN AWFUL THICK HEAD OF HAIR SAID JOHN BUT HE FELT WARM SEEMED TO BE ALL HAIR I'LL BET IT'S A BEAR CRIED WILLIS DENNED UP UNDER THE FLOOR WITH THAT JOHN AND I MADE FOR THE DOOR BUT WILLIS SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD COME OUT IF IT WAS ASLEEP FOR THE WINTER
8215-275211-0059 FOR SOME TIME WE STOOD NEAR THE DOOR PREPARED FOR FLIGHT IT WAS GROWING LIGHT AND WITH THE DAYLIGHT OUR COURAGE REVIVED FIRST WILLIS THEN JOHN AND I
8215-275211-0060 GROWING BOLDER WILLIS VENTURED SLOWLY TO LIFT ANOTHER FLOOR PLANK OVER WHERE OUR HAIRY BED FELLOW LAY AND EVEN NOW I SEEM TO SEE JOHN'S DILATED EYES AS WE LOOKED DOWN ON A GREAT ROUND MAT OF SHAGGY BLACK HAIR WE HAD NOW NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS INDEED A BEAR
8215-275211-0061 THE DISCOVERY EXCITED US SO THAT WE FORGOT OUR MISERIES THE BEAR'S SKIN AND THE STATE BOUNTY WOULD BE WORTH SIXTEEN DOLLARS
8215-275211-0062 IF WE COULD FIND THE WAY AND GET ASSISTANCE
8215-275211-0063 WE SAW TWO MEN COME OUT OF THE WOODS ONE OF THEM HAD A GUN
8215-275211-0064 WITH THE GUILE SO APT TO DEVELOP IN A BOY WHO HAS OLDER BROTHERS WHO TEASE HIM BUT WE DID SAID JOHN IF YOU TELL THEM I'LL LICK YOU EXCLAIMED WILLIS MAKE THEM BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN GUARDING THIS BEAR JOHN AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF SO GLARING A DECEPTION

8215-275211-0066 THEY MADE A RUDE SLED OF SAPLINGS OF THE KIND KNOWN TO HUNTERS AS A SCOOT AND DREW THE BEAR HOME
8215-275211-0067 THE MURCHES CLAIMED THE LION'S SHARE OF THE SPOILS BUT GAVE JOHN AND ME A DOLLAR APIECE AND I RECOLLECT THAT I HAD A VERY BAD COLD FOR A WEEK SAM'S CUT FOOT HEALED PROMPTLY
