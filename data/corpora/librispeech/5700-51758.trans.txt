5700-51758-0000 ONE OF THE FIRST CONSIDERATIONS WHICH AROSE IN THE BUSINESS MIND OF MISTER LORRY WHEN BUSINESS HOURS CAME ROUND WAS THIS THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IMPERIL TELLSON'S BY SHELTERING THE WIFE OF AN EMIGRANT PRISONER UNDER THE BANK ROOF
5700-51758-0001 HIS OWN POSSESSIONS SAFETY LIFE HE WOULD HAVE HAZARDED FOR LUCIE AND HER CHILD WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DEMUR BUT THE GREAT TRUST HE HELD WAS NOT HIS OWN AND AS TO THAT BUSINESS CHARGE HE WAS A STRICT MAN OF BUSINESS
5700-51758-0002 AT FIRST HIS MIND REVERTED TO DEFARGE AND HE THOUGHT OF FINDING OUT THE WINE SHOP AGAIN AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH ITS MASTER IN REFERENCE TO THE SAFEST DWELLING PLACE IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE CITY
5700-51758-0003 BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT SUGGESTED HIM REPUDIATED HIM HE LIVED IN THE MOST VIOLENT QUARTER AND DOUBTLESS WAS INFLUENTIAL THERE AND DEEP IN ITS DANGEROUS WORKINGS
5700-51758-0004 NOON COMING AND THE DOCTOR NOT RETURNING AND EVERY MINUTE'S DELAY TENDING TO COMPROMISE TELLSON'S MISTER LORRY ADVISED WITH LUCIE SHE SAID THAT HER FATHER HAD SPOKEN OF HIRING A LODGING FOR A SHORT TERM IN THAT QUARTER
5700-51758-0005 NEAR THE BANKING HOUSE AS THERE WAS NO BUSINESS OBJECTION TO THIS AND AS HE FORESAW THAT EVEN IF IT WERE ALL WELL WITH CHARLES AND HE WERE TO BE RELEASED HE COULD NOT HOPE TO LEAVE THE CITY MISTER LORRY WENT OUT IN QUEST OF SUCH A LODGING AND FOUND A SUITABLE ONE
5700-51758-0006 HIGH UP IN A REMOVED BY STREET WHERE THE CLOSED BLINDS IN ALL THE OTHER WINDOWS OF A HIGH MELANCHOLY SQUARE OF BUILDINGS MARKED DESERTED HOMES TO THIS LODGING HE AT ONCE REMOVED LUCIE AND HER CHILD AND MISS PROSS
5700-51758-0007 GIVING THEM WHAT COMFORT HE COULD AND MUCH MORE THAN HE HAD HIMSELF HE LEFT JERRY WITH THEM AS A FIGURE TO FILL A DOORWAY THAT WOULD BEAR CONSIDERABLE KNOCKING ON THE HEAD AND RETAINED TO HIS OWN OCCUPATIONS
5700-51758-0008 FOR ANSWER HE REPEATED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EMPHASIS THE WORDS DO YOU KNOW ME I HAVE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE PERHAPS AT MY WINE SHOP MUCH INTERESTED AND AGITATED MISTER LORRY SAID
5700-51758-0009 YOU COME FROM DOCTOR MANETTE YES I COME FROM DOCTOR MANETTE AND WHAT SAYS HE WHAT DOES HE SEND ME DEFARGE GAVE INTO HIS ANXIOUS HAND AN OPEN SCRAP OF PAPER IT BORE THE WORDS IN THE DOCTOR'S WRITING
5700-51758-0010 CHARLES IS SAFE BUT I CANNOT SAFELY LEAVE THIS PLACE YET I HAVE OBTAINED THE FAVOUR THAT THE BEARER HAS A SHORT NOTE FROM CHARLES TO HIS WIFE LET THE BEARER SEE HIS WIFE IT WAS DATED FROM LA FORCE WITHIN AN HOUR
5700-51758-0011 WILL YOU ACCOMPANY ME SAID MISTER LORRY JOYFULLY RELIEVED AFTER READING THIS NOTE ALOUD TO WHERE HIS WIFE RESIDES YES RETURNED DEFARGE
5700-51758-0012 SCARCELY NOTICING AS YET IN WHAT A CURIOUSLY RESERVED AND MECHANICAL WAY DEFARGE SPOKE MISTER LORRY PUT ON HIS HAT AND THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD THERE THEY FOUND TWO WOMEN ONE KNITTING

5700-51758-0015 BEGINNING TO BE STRUCK BY DEFARGE'S MANNER MISTER LORRY LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIM AND LED THE WAY BOTH THE WOMEN FOLLOWED THE SECOND WOMAN BEING THE VENGEANCE
5700-51758-0016 THEY PASSED THROUGH THE INTERVENING STREETS AS QUICKLY AS THEY MIGHT ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE OF THE NEW DOMICILE WERE ADMITTED BY JERRY AND FOUND LUCIE WEEPING
