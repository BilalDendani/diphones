561-126313-0000 THE WHITE SNAKE A LONG TIME AGO THERE LIVED A KING WHO WAS FAMED FOR HIS WISDOM THROUGH ALL THE LAND NOTHING WAS HIDDEN FROM HIM AND IT SEEMED AS IF NEWS OF THE MOST SECRET THINGS
561-126313-0001 WAS BROUGHT TO HIM THROUGH THE AIR BUT HE HAD A STRANGE CUSTOM EVERY DAY AFTER DINNER WHEN THE TABLE WAS CLEARED AND NO ONE ELSE WAS PRESENT A TRUSTY SERVANT HAD TO BRING HIM ONE MORE DISH IT WAS COVERED HOWEVER
561-126313-0002 AND EVEN THE SERVANT DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT NEITHER DID ANYONE KNOW
561-126313-0003 THIS HAD GONE ON FOR A LONG TIME WHEN ONE DAY THE SERVANT WHO TOOK AWAY THE DISH WAS OVERCOME WITH SUCH CURIOSITY THAT HE COULD NOT HELP CARRYING THE DISH INTO HIS ROOM WHEN HE HAD CAREFULLY LOCKED THE DOOR HE LIFTED UP THE COVER
561-126313-0004 AND SAW A WHITE SNAKE LYING ON THE DISH BUT WHEN HE SAW IT HE COULD NOT DENY HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF TASTING IT SO HE CUT OF A LITTLE BIT AND PUT IT INTO HIS MOUTH NO SOONER HAD IT TOUCHED HIS TONGUE
561-126313-0005 THAN HE HEARD A STRANGE WHISPERING OF LITTLE VOICES OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW HE WENT AND LISTENED AND THEN NOTICED THAT IT WAS THE SPARROWS WHO WERE CHATTERING TOGETHER AND TELLING ONE ANOTHER OF ALL KINDS OF THINGS WHICH THEY HAD SEEN IN THE FIELDS AND WOODS
561-126313-0006 EATING THE SNAKE HAD GIVEN HIM POWER OF UNDERSTANDING THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS NOW IT SO HAPPENED THAT ON THIS VERY DAY THE QUEEN LOST HER MOST BEAUTIFUL RING AND SUSPICION OF HAVING STOLEN IT FELL UPON THIS TRUSTY SERVANT
561-126313-0007 WHO WAS ALLOWED TO GO EVERYWHERE THE KING ORDERED THE MAN TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND THREATENED WITH ANGRY WORDS THAT UNLESS HE COULD BEFORE THE MORROW POINT OUT THE THIEF HE HIMSELF SHOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS GUILTY AND EXECUTED IN VAIN HE DECLARED HIS INNOCENCE
561-126313-0008 HE WAS DISMISSED WITH NO BETTER ANSWER IN HIS TROUBLE AND FEAR HE WENT DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD AND TOOK THOUGHT HOW TO HELP HIMSELF OUT OF HIS TROUBLE NOW SOME DUCKS WERE SITTING TOGETHER QUIETLY BY A BROOK AND TAKING THEIR REST
561-126313-0009 AND WHILST THEY WERE MAKING THEIR FEATHERS SMOOTH WITH THEIR BILLS THEY WERE HAVING A CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION TOGETHER THE SERVANT STOOD BY AND LISTENED THEY WERE TELLING ONE ANOTHER OF ALL THE PLACES WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WADDLING ABOUT ALL THE MORNING AND WHAT GOOD FOOD THEY HAD FOUND
561-126313-0010 AND ONE SAID IN A PITIFUL TONE
561-126313-0011 AS I WAS EATING IN HASTE I SWALLOWED A RING WHICH LAY UNDER THE QUEEN'S WINDOW THE SERVANT AT ONCE SEIZED HER BY THE NECK CARRIED HER TO THE KITCHEN AND SAID TO THE COOK HERE IS A FINE DUCK PRAY KILL HER YES SAID THE COOK AND WEIGHED HER IN HIS HAND
561-126313-0012 SHE HAS SPARED NO TROUBLE TO FATTEN HERSELF
561-126313-0013 SO HE CUT OFF HER HEAD AND AS SHE WAS BEING DRESSED FOR THE SPIT THE QUEEN'S RING WAS FOUND INSIDE HER THE SERVANT COULD NOW EASILY PROVE HIS INNOCENCE AND THE KING TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE WRONG
561-126313-0014 ALLOWED HIM TO ASK A FAVOUR AND PROMISED HIM THE BEST PLACE IN THE COURT THAT HE COULD WISH FOR THE SERVANT REFUSED EVERYTHING AND ONLY ASKED FOR A HORSE AND SOME MONEY FOR TRAVELLING
561-126313-0015 ABOUT A LITTLE WHEN HIS REQUEST WAS GRANTED HE SET OUT ON HIS WAY AND ONE DAY CAME TO A POND WHERE HE SAW THREE FISHES CAUGHT IN THE REEDS AND GASPING FOR WATER NOW THOUGH IT IS SAID THAT FISHES ARE DUMB
561-126313-0016 HE HEARD THEM LAMENTING THAT THEY MUST PERISH SO MISERABLY AND AS HE HAD A KIND HEART HE GOT OFF HIS HORSE AND PUT THE THREE PRISONERS BACK INTO THE WATER THEY LEAPT
561-126313-0017 PUT OUT THEIR HEADS AND CRIED TO HIM WE WILL REMEMBER YOU AND REPAY YOU FOR SAVING US HE RODE ON AND AFTER A WHILE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HEARD A VOICE IN THE SAND AT HIS FEET HE LISTENED AND HEARD AN ANT KING COMPLAIN
561-126313-0018 WHY CANNOT FOLKS WITH THEIR CLUMSY BEASTS KEEP OFF OUR BODIES
561-126313-0019 HAS BEEN TREADING DOWN MY PEOPLE WITHOUT MERCY SO HE TURNED ON TO A SIDE PATH AND THE ANT KING CRIED OUT TO HIM WE WILL REMEMBER YOU ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER THE PATH LED HIM INTO A WOOD
561-126313-0020 AND THERE HE SAW TWO OLD RAVENS STANDING BY THEIR NEST AND THROWING OUT THEIR YOUNG ONES OUT WITH YOU YOU IDLE GOOD FOR NOTHING CREATURES CRIED THEY WE CANNOT FIND FOOD FOR YOU ANY LONGER YOU ARE BIG ENOUGH AND CAN PROVIDE FOR YOURSELVES BUT THE POOR YOUNG RAVENS LAY UPON THE GROUND
561-126313-0021 FLAPPING THEIR WINGS AND CRYING OH WHAT HELPLESS CHICKS WE ARE WE MUST SHIFT FOR OURSELVES AND YET WE CANNOT FLY WHAT CAN WE DO BUT LIE HERE AND STARVE SO THE GOOD YOUNG FELLOW ALIGHTED AND KILLED HIS HORSE WITH HIS SWORD AND GAVE IT TO THEM FOR FOOD
561-126313-0022 THEN THEY CAME HOPPING UP TO IT SATISFIED THEIR HUNGER AND CRIED WE WILL REMEMBER YOU ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER
561-126313-0023 AND WHEN HE HAD WALKED A LONG WAY HE CAME TO A LARGE CITY THERE WAS A GREAT NOISE AND CROWD IN THE STREETS AND A MAN RODE UP ON HORSEBACK CRYING ALOUD THE KING'S DAUGHTER WANTS A HUSBAND BUT WHOEVER SEEKS HER HAND MUST PERFORM A HARD TASK
561-126313-0024 MANY HAD ALREADY MADE THE ATTEMPT BUT IN VAIN NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE YOUTH SAW THE KING'S DAUGHTER
561-126313-0025 WENT BEFORE THE KING AND DECLARED HIMSELF A SUITOR SO HE WAS LED OUT TO THE SEA AND A GOLD RING WAS THROWN INTO IT BEFORE HIS EYES THEN THE KING ORDERED HIM TO FETCH THIS RING UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND ADDED
561-126313-0026 IF YOU COME UP AGAIN WITHOUT IT YOU WILL BE THROWN IN AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL YOU PERISH AMID THE WAVES ALL THE PEOPLE GRIEVED FOR THE HANDSOME YOUTH THEN THEY WENT AWAY LEAVING HIM ALONE BY THE SEA HE STOOD ON THE SHORE AND CONSIDERED WHAT HE SHOULD DO
561-126313-0027 WHEN SUDDENLY HE SAW THREE FISHES COME SWIMMING TOWARDS HIM AND THEY WERE THE VERY FISHES WHOSE LIVES HE HAD SAVED THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE HELD A MUSSEL IN ITS MOUTH WHICH IT LAID ON THE SHORE AT THE YOUTH'S FEET
561-126313-0028 THERE LAY THE GOLD RING IN THE SHELL FULL OF JOY HE TOOK IT TO THE KING AND EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD GRANT HIM THE PROMISED REWARD BUT WHEN THE PROUD PRINCESS PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS NOT HER EQUAL IN BIRTH SHE SCORNED HIM AND REQUIRED HIM FIRST TO PERFORM ANOTHER TASK
561-126313-0029 SHE WENT DOWN INTO THE GARDEN AND STREWED WITH HER OWN HANDS TEN SACKSFUL OF MILLET SEED ON THE GRASS THEN SHE SAID
561-126313-0030 BUT AS SOON AS THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SHONE INTO THE GARDEN HE SAW ALL THE TEN SACKS STANDING SIDE BY SIDE QUITE FULL
561-126313-0031 AND THE GRATEFUL CREATURES HAD BY GREAT INDUSTRY PICKED UP ALL THE MILLET SEED AND GATHERED THEM INTO THE SACKS PRESENTLY THE KING'S DAUGHTER HERSELF CAME DOWN INTO THE GARDEN AND WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD DONE THE TASK SHE HAD GIVEN HIM BUT SHE COULD NOT YET CONQUER HER PROUD HEART AND SAID
561-126313-0032 HE SHALL NOT BE MY HUSBAND UNTIL HE HAD BROUGHT ME AN APPLE FROM THE TREE OF LIFE THE YOUTH DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE TREE OF LIFE STOOD BUT HE SET OUT AND WOULD HAVE GONE ON FOR EVER AS LONG AS HIS LEGS WOULD CARRY HIM THOUGH HE HAD NO HOPE OF FINDING IT
561-126313-0033 AFTER HE HAD WANDERED THROUGH THREE KINGDOMS HE CAME ONE EVENING TO A WOOD AND LAY DOWN UNDER A TREE TO SLEEP BUT HE HEARD A RUSTLING IN THE BRANCHES AND A GOLDEN APPLE FELL INTO HIS HAND AT THE SAME TIME THREE RAVENS FLEW DOWN TO HIM PERCHED THEMSELVES UPON HIS KNEE AND SAID
