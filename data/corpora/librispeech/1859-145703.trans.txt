1859-145703-0000 THERE WAS ONCE A YOUNG HUNTER WHO WENT BOLDLY INTO THE FOREST HE HAD A MERRY AND LIGHT HEART AND AS HE WENT WHISTLING ALONG THERE CAME AN UGLY OLD WOMAN WHO SAID TO HIM GOOD DAY DEAR HUNTER YOU ARE VERY MERRY AND CONTENTED
1859-145703-0001 BUT I SUFFER HUNGER AND THIRST SO GIVE ME A TRIFLE THE HUNTER WAS SORRY FOR THE POOR OLD WOMAN AND HE FELT IN HIS POCKET AND GAVE HER ALL HE COULD SPARE HE WAS GOING ON THEN BUT THE OLD WOMAN STOPPED HIM AND SAID
1859-145703-0002 THEY WILL LET THE CLOAK FALL BUT ONE OF THE BIRDS WILL BE HIT AND WILL DROP DOWN DEAD TAKE THE CLOAK WITH YOU IT IS A WISHING CLOAK AND WHEN YOU THROW IT ON YOUR SHOULDERS YOU HAVE ONLY TO WISH YOURSELF AT A CERTAIN PLACE AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE YOU ARE THERE
1859-145703-0003 PULLED THE TRIGGER AND SHOT INTO THE MIDST OF THEM SO THAT THEIR FEATHERS FLEW ABOUT THEN THE FLOCK TOOK FLIGHT WITH MUCH SCREAMING BUT ONE FELL DEAD AND THE CLOAK FLUTTERED DOWN THEN THE HUNTER DID AS THE OLD WOMAN HAD TOLD HIM
1859-145703-0004 HE CUT OPEN THE BIRD FOUND ITS HEART SWALLOWED IT AND TOOK THE CLOAK HOME WITH HIM THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE AWOKE HE REMEMBERED THE PROMISE AND WANTED TO SEE IF IT HAD COME TRUE BUT WHEN HE LIFTED UP HIS PILLOW THERE SPARKLED THE GOLD PIECE
1859-145703-0005 AND THE NEXT MORNING HE FOUND ANOTHER AND SO ON EVERY TIME HE GOT UP HE COLLECTED A HEAP OF GOLD BUT AT LAST HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
1859-145703-0006 SO HE TOOK LEAVE OF HIS PARENTS SLUNG HIS HUNTING KNAPSACK AND HIS GUN ROUND HIM AND JOURNEYED INTO THE WORLD IT HAPPENED THAT ONE DAY HE WENT THROUGH A THICK WOOD AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE END OF IT THERE LAY IN THE PLAIN BEFORE HIM A LARGE CASTLE
1859-145703-0007 AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS IN IT STOOD AN OLD WOMAN WITH A MOST BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN BY HER SIDE LOOKING OUT BUT THE OLD WOMAN WAS A WITCH AND SHE SAID TO THE GIRL
1859-145703-0008 THERE COMES ONE OUT OF THE WOOD WHO HAS A WONDERFUL TREASURE IN HIS BODY WHICH WE MUST MANAGE TO POSSESS OURSELVES OF DARLING DAUGHTER WE HAVE MORE RIGHT TO IT THAN HE HE HAS A BIRD'S HEART IN HIM
1859-145703-0009 AND SO EVERY MORNING THERE LIES A GOLD PIECE UNDER HIS PILLOW SHE TOLD HER HOW THEY COULD GET HOLD OF IT AND HOW SHE WAS TO COAX IT FROM HIM AND AT LAST THREATENED HER ANGRILY SAYING
1859-145703-0010 WHEN THE HUNTER CAME NEARER HE SAW THE MAIDEN AND SAID TO HIMSELF
1859-145703-0011 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE WAS SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH THE WITCH MAIDEN THAT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE AND ONLY LOOKED IN HER EYES AND WHATEVER SHE WANTED THAT HE GLADLY DID THEN THE OLD WITCH SAID NOW WE MUST HAVE THE BIRD HEART HE WILL NOT FEEL WHEN IT IS GONE
1859-145703-0012 WHO HAD TO HAND IT TO THE HUNTER DRINK TO ME NOW MY DEAREST SHE SAID THEN HE TOOK THE GOBLET AND WHEN HE HAD SWALLOWED THE DRINK THE BIRD HEART CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH THE MAIDEN HAD TO GET HOLD OF IT SECRETLY AND THEN SWALLOW IT HERSELF
1859-145703-0013 FOR THE OLD WITCH WANTED TO HAVE IT THENCEFORWARD HE FOUND NO MORE GOLD UNDER HIS PILLOW AND IT LAY UNDER THE MAIDEN'S BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IN LOVE AND SO MUCH BEWITCHED THAT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING EXCEPT SPENDING ALL HIS TIME WITH THE MAIDEN
1859-145703-0014 THE OLD WITCH GREW ANGRY AND SAID SUCH A CLOAK IS A WONDERFUL THING IT IS SELDOM TO BE HAD IN THE WORLD AND HAVE IT I MUST AND WILL SHE BEAT THE MAIDEN AND SAID THAT IF SHE DID NOT OBEY IT WOULD GO ILL WITH HER
1859-145703-0015 SO SHE DID HER MOTHER'S BIDDING AND STANDING ONE DAY BY THE WINDOW SHE LOOKED AWAY INTO THE FAR DISTANCE AS IF SHE WERE VERY SAD WHY ARE YOU STANDING THERE LOOKING SO SAD ASKED THE HUNTER
1859-145703-0016 ALAS MY LOVE SHE REPLIED OVER THERE LIES THE GRANITE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE COSTLY PRECIOUS STONES GROW I HAVE A GREAT LONGING TO GO THERE SO THAT WHEN I THINK OF IT I AM VERY SAD FOR WHO CAN FETCH THEM
1859-145703-0017 ONLY THE BIRDS WHO FLY A MAN NEVER IF YOU HAVE NO OTHER TROUBLE SAID THE HUNTER THAT ONE I CAN EASILY REMOVE FROM YOUR HEART SO HE WRAPPED HER ROUND IN HIS CLOAK AND WISHED THEMSELVES TO THE GRANITE MOUNTAIN
1859-145703-0018 SITTING ON IT THE PRECIOUS STONES SPARKLED SO BRIGHTLY ON ALL SIDES THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SEE THEM AND THEY COLLECTED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND COSTLY TOGETHER BUT NOW THE OLD WITCH HAD THROUGH HER CAUSED THE HUNTER'S EYES TO BECOME HEAVY
1859-145703-0019 I AM SO TIRED THAT I CAN HARDLY STAND ON MY FEET SO THEY SAT DOWN AND HE LAID HIS HEAD ON HER LAP AND FELL ASLEEP AS SOON AS HE WAS SOUND ASLEEP SHE UNFASTENED THE CLOAK FROM HIS SHOULDERS THREW IT ON HER OWN
1859-145703-0020 LEFT THE GRANITE AND STONES AND WISHED HERSELF HOME AGAIN BUT WHEN THE HUNTER HAD FINISHED HIS SLEEP AND AWOKE HE FOUND THAT HIS LOVE HAD BETRAYED HIM AND LEFT HIM ALONE ON THE WILD MOUNTAIN OH SAID HE
1859-145703-0021 AND HE HAD NOT SAT LONG BEFORE HE SAW THREE OF THEM STRIDING TOWARDS HIM
1859-145703-0022 THE GIANTS CAME UP AND THE FIRST PUSHED HIM WITH HIS FOOT AND SAID WHAT SORT OF AN EARTHWORM IS THAT THE SECOND SAID CRUSH HIM DEAD BUT THE THIRD SAID CONTEMPTUOUSLY IT IS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE LET HIM LIVE HE CANNOT REMAIN HERE
1859-145703-0023 AND IF HE GOES HIGHER UP THE MOUNTAIN THE CLOUDS WILL TAKE HIM AND CARRY HIM OFF TALKING THUS THEY WENT AWAY BUT THE HUNTER HAD LISTENED TO THEIR TALK AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD GONE HE ROSE AND CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT
1859-145703-0024 A CLOUD SWEPT BY AND SEIZING HIM CARRIED HIM AWAY IT TRAVELLED FOR A TIME IN THE SKY AND THEN IT SANK DOWN AND HOVERED OVER A LARGE VEGETABLE GARDEN SURROUNDED BY WALLS SO THAT HE CAME SAFELY TO THE GROUND AMIDST CABBAGES AND VEGETABLES
1859-145703-0025 THE HUNTER THEN LOOKED ABOUT HIM SAYING IF ONLY I HAD SOMETHING TO EAT I AM SO HUNGRY AND IT WILL GO BADLY WITH ME IN THE FUTURE FOR I SEE HERE NOT AN APPLE OR PEAR OR FRUIT OF ANY KIND NOTHING BUT VEGETABLES EVERYWHERE AT LAST HE THOUGHT
1859-145703-0026 AND FOUND HIMSELF WONDERFULLY CHANGED FOUR LEGS BEGAN TO GROW ON HIM A THICK HEAD AND TWO LONG EARS AND HE SAW WITH HORROR THAT HE HAD CHANGED INTO A DONKEY BUT AS HE WAS STILL VERY HUNGRY AND THIS JUICY SALAD TASTED VERY GOOD TO HIS PRESENT NATURE
1859-145703-0027 HE WENT ON EATING WITH A STILL GREATER APPETITE AT LAST HE GOT HOLD OF ANOTHER KIND OF CABBAGE BUT SCARCELY HAD SWALLOWED IT WHEN HE FELT ANOTHER CHANGE AND HE ONCE MORE REGAINED HIS HUMAN FORM THE HUNTER NOW LAY DOWN AND SLEPT OFF HIS WEARINESS
1859-145703-0028 AND WENT INTO THE CASTLE WHERE HE BEGGED FOR A LODGING I AM SO TIRED HE SAID I CAN GO NO FARTHER THE WITCH ASKED COUNTRYMAN WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS HE ANSWERED I AM A MESSENGER OF THE KING
1859-145703-0029 WHEN THE OLD WITCH HEARD OF THE FINE SALAD SHE WANTED TO EAT IT AND SAID DEAR COUNTRYMAN JUST LET ME TASTE THE WONDERFUL SALAD WHY NOT HE ANSWERED I HAVE BROUGHT TWO HEADS WITH ME AND WILL GIVE YOU ONE SO SAYING
1859-145703-0030 HE OPENED HIS SACK AND GAVE HER THE BAD ONE THE WITCH SUSPECTED NO EVIL AND HER MOUTH WATERED TO TASTE THE NEW DISH SO THAT SHE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO PREPARE IT HERSELF WHEN IT WAS READY SHE COULD NOT WAIT TILL IT WAS SERVED AT THE TABLE
1859-145703-0031 BUT SHE IMMEDIATELY TOOK A COUPLE OF LEAVES AND PUT THEM IN HER MOUTH NO SOONER HOWEVER HAD SHE SWALLOWED THEM THAN SHE LOST HUMAN FORM AND RAN INTO THE COURTYARD IN THE SHAPE OF A DONKEY NOW THE SERVANT CAME INTO THE KITCHEN
1859-145703-0032 AND WHEN SHE SAW THE SALAD STANDING THERE READY COOKED SHE WAS ABOUT TO CARRY IT UP BUT ON THE WAY ACCORDING TO HER OLD HABIT SHE TASTED IT AND ATE A COUPLE OF LEAVES IMMEDIATELY THE CHARM WORKED
1859-145703-0033 AND SHE BECAME A DONKEY AND RAN OUT TO JOIN THE OLD WITCH AND THE DISH WITH THE SALAD IN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IN THE MEANTIME THE MESSENGER WAS SITTING WITH THE LOVELY MAIDEN AND AS NO ONE CAME WITH THE SALAD AND SHE WANTED VERY MUCH TO TASTE IT SHE SAID
1859-145703-0034 I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SALAD IS THEN THOUGHT THE HUNTER THE CABBAGE MUST HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO WORK AND HE SAID I WILL GO TO THE KITCHEN AND FETCH IT MYSELF WHEN HE CAME THERE HE SAW THE TWO DONKEYS RUNNING ABOUT IN THE COURTYARD BUT THE SALAD WAS LYING ON THE GROUND
1859-145703-0035 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID HE TWO HAVE HAD THEIR SHARE AND LIFTING THE REMAINING LEAVES UP HE LAID THEM ON THE DISH AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE MAIDEN I AM BRINGING YOU THE DELICIOUS FOOD MY OWN SELF HE SAID

1859-145703-0037 NOW YOU SHALL RECEIVE A REWARD FOR YOUR FAITHLESSNESS HE TIED THEM ALL THREE WITH A ROPE AND DROVE THEM AWAY TILL HE CAME TO A MILL HE KNOCKED AT THE WINDOW AND THE MILLER PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND ASKED WHAT HE WANTED I HAVE THREE TIRESOME ANIMALS HE ANSWERED
