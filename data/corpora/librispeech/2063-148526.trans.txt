2063-148526-0000 IT MAY BE SUPPOSED FROM WHAT HAS JUST BEEN SAID THAT THE LOVE OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS MUST CONSTANTLY URGE THE AMERICANS TO IRREGULARITIES IN MORALS
2063-148526-0001 DISTURB THE PEACE OF FAMILIES AND THREATEN THE SECURITY OF SOCIETY AT LARGE SUCH IS NOT THE CASE THE PASSION FOR PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS PRODUCES IN DEMOCRACIES EFFECTS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH IT OCCASIONS
2063-148526-0002 IN ARISTOCRATIC NATIONS IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT WEARIED WITH PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND SATED WITH OPULENCE AMIDST THE RUIN OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND THE DECLINE OF THE STATE THE HEART OF AN ARISTOCRACY
2063-148526-0003 MAY BY DEGREES BE SEDUCED TO THE PURSUIT OF SENSUAL ENJOYMENTS ONLY AT OTHER TIMES THE POWER OF THE MONARCH OR THE WEAKNESS OF THE PEOPLE WITHOUT STRIPPING THE NOBILITY OF THEIR FORTUNE
2063-148526-0004 COMPELS THEM TO STAND ALOOF FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF AFFAIRS AND WHILST THE ROAD TO MIGHTY ENTERPRISE IS CLOSED ABANDONS THEM TO THE INQUIETUDE OF THEIR OWN DESIRES
2063-148526-0005 THEY THEN FALL BACK HEAVILY UPON THEMSELVES AND SEEK IN THE PLEASURES OF THE BODY OBLIVION OF THEIR FORMER GREATNESS WHEN THE MEMBERS OF AN ARISTOCRATIC BODY ARE THUS EXCLUSIVELY DEVOTED TO THE PURSUIT OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS
2063-148526-0006 THEY COMMONLY CONCENTRATE IN THAT DIRECTION ALL THE ENERGY WHICH THEY DERIVE FROM THEIR LONG EXPERIENCE OF POWER SUCH MEN ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE PURSUIT OF COMFORT
2063-148526-0007 THEY REQUIRE SUMPTUOUS DEPRAVITY AND SPLENDID CORRUPTION THE WORSHIP THEY PAY THE SENSES IS A GORGEOUS ONE AND THEY SEEM TO VIE WITH EACH OTHER IN THE ART OF DEGRADING THEIR OWN NATURES
2063-148526-0008 THE STRONGER THE MORE FAMOUS AND THE MORE FREE AN ARISTOCRACY HAS BEEN THE MORE DEPRAVED WILL IT THEN BECOME AND HOWEVER BRILLIANT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LUSTRE OF ITS VIRTUES
2063-148526-0009 I DARE PREDICT THAT THEY WILL ALWAYS BE SURPASSED BY THE SPLENDOR OF ITS VICES THE TASTE FOR PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS LEADS A DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE INTO NO SUCH EXCESSES
2063-148526-0010 THE LOVE OF WELL BEING IS THERE DISPLAYED AS A TENACIOUS EXCLUSIVE UNIVERSAL PASSION BUT ITS RANGE IS CONFINED TO BUILD ENORMOUS PALACES TO CONQUER OR TO MIMIC NATURE
2063-148526-0011 TO PLANT AN ORCHARD TO ENLARGE A DWELLING TO BE ALWAYS MAKING LIFE MORE COMFORTABLE AND CONVENIENT TO AVOID TROUBLE AND TO SATISFY THE SMALLEST WANTS WITHOUT EFFORT AND ALMOST WITHOUT COST THESE ARE SMALL OBJECTS
2063-148526-0012 BUT THE SOUL CLINGS TO THEM IT DWELLS UPON THEM CLOSELY AND DAY BY DAY TILL THEY AT LAST SHUT OUT THE REST OF THE WORLD AND SOMETIMES INTERVENE BETWEEN ITSELF AND HEAVEN THIS IT MAY BE SAID
2063-148526-0013 CAN ONLY BE APPLICABLE TO THOSE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE IN HUMBLE CIRCUMSTANCES WEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS WILL DISPLAY TASTES AKIN TO THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THEM IN ARISTOCRATIC AGES I CONTEST
2063-148526-0014 THE PROPOSITION IN POINT OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS THE MOST OPULENT MEMBERS OF A DEMOCRACY WILL NOT DISPLAY TASTES VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE PEOPLE WHETHER IT BE THAT SPRINGING FROM THE PEOPLE THEY REALLY SHARE THOSE TASTES
2063-148526-0015 OR THAT THEY ESTEEM IT A DUTY TO SUBMIT TO THEM IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY THE SENSUALITY OF THE PUBLIC HAS TAKEN A MODERATE AND TRANQUIL COURSE TO WHICH ALL ARE BOUND TO CONFORM
2063-148526-0016 IT IS AS DIFFICULT TO DEPART FROM THE COMMON RULE BY ONE'S VICES AS BY ONE'S VIRTUES RICH MEN WHO LIVE AMIDST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS ARE THEREFORE MORE INTENT ON PROVIDING FOR THEIR SMALLEST WANTS
2063-148526-0017 THAN FOR THEIR EXTRAORDINARY ENJOYMENTS THEY GRATIFY A NUMBER OF PETTY DESIRES WITHOUT INDULGING IN ANY GREAT IRREGULARITIES OF PASSION THUS THEY ARE MORE APT TO BECOME
2063-148526-0018 THE ESPECIAL TASTE WHICH THE MEN OF DEMOCRATIC AGES ENTERTAIN FOR PHYSICAL ENJOYMENTS IS NOT NATURALLY OPPOSED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC ORDER NAY IT OFTEN STANDS IN NEED OF ORDER THAT IT MAY BE GRATIFIED
2063-148526-0019 NOR IS IT ADVERSE TO REGULARITY OF MORALS FOR GOOD MORALS CONTRIBUTE TO PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY AND ARE FAVORABLE TO INDUSTRY
2063-148526-0020 MEN WISH TO BE AS WELL OFF AS THEY CAN IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT FOREGOING THEIR CHANCE OF ANOTHER SOME PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS CANNOT BE INDULGED IN WITHOUT CRIME FROM SUCH THEY STRICTLY ABSTAIN
2063-148526-0021 THE ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS IS SANCTIONED BY RELIGION AND MORALITY TO THESE THE HEART THE IMAGINATION AND LIFE ITSELF ARE UNRESERVEDLY GIVEN UP TILL IN SNATCHING AT THESE LESSER GIFTS
2063-148526-0022 MEN LOSE SIGHT OF THOSE MORE PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GLORY AND THE GREATNESS OF MANKIND THE REPROACH I ADDRESS TO THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY
2063-148526-0023 IS NOT THAT IT LEADS MEN AWAY IN THE PURSUIT OF FORBIDDEN ENJOYMENTS BUT THAT IT ABSORBS THEM WHOLLY IN QUEST OF THOSE WHICH ARE ALLOWED BY THESE MEANS A KIND OF VIRTUOUS MATERIALISM
2063-148526-0024 MAY ULTIMATELY BE ESTABLISHED IN THE WORLD WHICH WOULD NOT CORRUPT BUT
2063-148526-0025 CAUSES OF FANATICAL ENTHUSIASM IN SOME AMERICANS ALTHOUGH THE DESIRE OF ACQUIRING THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS WORLD IS THE PREVAILING PASSION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CERTAIN
2063-148526-0026 MOMENTARY OUTBREAKS OCCUR WHEN THEIR SOULS SEEM SUDDENLY TO BURST THE BONDS OF MATTER BY WHICH THEY ARE RESTRAINED AND TO SOAR IMPETUOUSLY TOWARDS HEAVEN
2063-148526-0027 IN ALL THE STATES OF THE UNION BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE HALF PEOPLED COUNTRY OF THE FAR WEST WANDERING PREACHERS MAY BE MET WITH WHO HAWK ABOUT THE WORD OF GOD FROM PLACE TO PLACE
2063-148526-0028 WHOLE FAMILIES OLD MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN CROSS ROUGH PASSES AND UNTRODDEN WILDS COMING FROM A GREAT DISTANCE TO JOIN A CAMP MEETING WHERE THEY TOTALLY FORGET FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND NIGHTS IN LISTENING TO THESE DISCOURSES
2063-148526-0029 THE CARES OF BUSINESS AND EVEN THE MOST URGENT WANTS OF THE BODY HERE AND THERE IN THE MIDST OF AMERICAN SOCIETY YOU MEET WITH MEN FULL OF A FANATICAL AND ALMOST WILD ENTHUSIASM WHICH HARDLY EXISTS IN EUROPE
2063-148526-0030 FROM TIME TO TIME STRANGE SECTS ARISE WHICH ENDEAVOR TO STRIKE OUT EXTRAORDINARY PATHS TO ETERNAL HAPPINESS RELIGIOUS INSANITY IS VERY COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES NOR OUGHT THESE FACTS TO SURPRISE US
2063-148526-0031 IT WAS NOT MAN WHO IMPLANTED IN HIMSELF THE TASTE FOR WHAT IS INFINITE AND THE LOVE OF WHAT IS IMMORTAL THOSE LOFTY INSTINCTS ARE NOT THE OFFSPRING OF HIS CAPRICIOUS WILL
2063-148526-0032 THEIR STEADFAST FOUNDATION IS FIXED IN HUMAN NATURE AND THEY EXIST IN SPITE OF HIS EFFORTS HE MAY CROSS AND DISTORT THEM DESTROY THEM HE CANNOT
2063-148526-0033 THE SOUL HAS WANTS WHICH MUST BE SATISFIED AND WHATEVER PAINS BE TAKEN TO DIVERT IT FROM ITSELF IT SOON GROWS WEARY RESTLESS AND DISQUIETED AMIDST THE ENJOYMENTS OF SENSE
2063-148526-0034 IF EVER THE FACULTIES OF THE GREAT MAJORITY OF MANKIND WERE EXCLUSIVELY BENT UPON THE PURSUIT OF MATERIAL OBJECTS IT MIGHT BE ANTICIPATED THAT AN AMAZING REACTION WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE SOULS OF SOME MEN
2063-148526-0035 THEY WOULD DRIFT AT LARGE IN THE WORLD OF SPIRITS FOR FEAR OF REMAINING SHACKLED BY THE CLOSE BONDAGE OF THE BODY IT IS NOT THEN WONDERFUL IF IN THE MIDST OF A COMMUNITY WHOSE THOUGHTS TEND EARTHWARD
2063-148526-0036 A SMALL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ARE TO BE FOUND WHO TURN THEIR LOOKS TO HEAVEN I SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF MYSTICISM DID NOT SOON MAKE SOME ADVANCE AMONGST A PEOPLE SOLELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING ITS OWN WORLDLY WELFARE
2063-148526-0037 I SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT IT WAS BY THE LUXURIES OF ROME AND THE EPICUREAN PHILOSOPHY OF GREECE
2063-148526-0038 IF THEIR SOCIAL CONDITION THEIR PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEIR LAWS DID NOT CONFINE THE MINDS OF THE AMERICANS SO CLOSELY TO THE PURSUIT OF WORLDLY WELFARE
2063-148526-0039 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEY WOULD DISPLAY MORE RESERVE AND MORE EXPERIENCE WHENEVER THEIR ATTENTION IS TURNED TO THINGS IMMATERIAL AND THAT THEY WOULD CHECK THEMSELVES WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
2063-148526-0040 BUT THEY FEEL IMPRISONED WITHIN BOUNDS WHICH THEY WILL APPARENTLY NEVER BE ALLOWED TO PASS
