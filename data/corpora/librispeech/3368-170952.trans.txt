3368-170952-0000 IF WE MEAN THEM TO HONOUR THE GODS AND THEIR PARENTS AND TO VALUE FRIENDSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER YES AND I THINK THAT OUR PRINCIPLES ARE RIGHT HE SAID BUT IF THEY ARE TO BE COURAGEOUS MUST THEY NOT LEARN OTHER LESSONS BESIDES THESE AND LESSONS OF SUCH A KIND AS WILL TAKE AWAY THE FEAR OF DEATH
3368-170952-0001 CERTAINLY NOT HE SAID AND CAN HE BE FEARLESS OF DEATH OR WILL HE CHOOSE DEATH IN BATTLE RATHER THAN DEFEAT AND SLAVERY WHO BELIEVES THE WORLD BELOW TO BE REAL AND TERRIBLE IMPOSSIBLE
3368-170952-0002 THAT WILL BE OUR DUTY HE SAID THEN I SAID WE SHALL HAVE TO OBLITERATE MANY OBNOXIOUS PASSAGES BEGINNING WITH THE VERSES
3368-170952-0003 I WOULD RATHER BE A SERF ON THE LAND OF A POOR AND PORTIONLESS MAN THAN RULE OVER ALL THE DEAD WHO HAVE COME TO NOUGHT WE MUST ALSO EXPUNGE THE VERSE WHICH TELLS US HOW PLUTO FEARED
3368-170952-0004 THAT HE ALONE SHOULD BE WISE BUT THE OTHER SOULS ARE FLITTING SHADES AGAIN
3368-170952-0005 LAMENTING HER FATE LEAVING MANHOOD AND YOUTH AGAIN AND THE SOUL WITH SHRILLING CRY PASSED LIKE SMOKE BENEATH THE EARTH AND AS BATS IN HOLLOW OF MYSTIC CAVERN
3368-170952-0006 WHENEVER ANY OF THEM HAS DROPPED OUT OF THE STRING AND FALLS FROM THE ROCK FLY SHRILLING AND CLING TO ONE ANOTHER SO DID THEY WITH SHRILLING CRY HOLD TOGETHER AS THEY MOVED AND WE MUST BEG HOMER AND THE OTHER POETS NOT TO BE ANGRY IF WE STRIKE OUT THESE AND SIMILAR PASSAGES
3368-170952-0007 NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE UNPOETICAL OR UNATTRACTIVE TO THE POPULAR EAR BUT BECAUSE THE GREATER THE POETICAL CHARM OF THEM THE LESS ARE THEY MEET FOR THE EARS OF BOYS AND MEN WHO ARE MEANT TO BE FREE AND WHO SHOULD FEAR SLAVERY MORE THAN DEATH UNDOUBTEDLY
3368-170952-0008 ALSO WE SHALL HAVE TO REJECT ALL THE TERRIBLE AND APPALLING NAMES WHICH DESCRIBE THE WORLD BELOW COCYTUS AND STYX GHOSTS UNDER THE EARTH AND SAPLESS SHADES
3368-170952-0009 AND ANY SIMILAR WORDS OF WHICH THE VERY MENTION CAUSES A SHUDDER TO PASS THROUGH THE INMOST SOUL OF HIM WHO HEARS THEM I DO NOT SAY THAT THESE HORRIBLE STORIES MAY NOT HAVE A USE OF SOME KIND BUT THERE IS A DANGER THAT THE NERVES OF OUR GUARDIANS MAY BE RENDERED TOO EXCITABLE AND EFFEMINATE BY THEM
3368-170952-0010 THERE IS A REAL DANGER HE SAID THEN WE MUST HAVE NO MORE OF THEM TRUE
3368-170952-0011 CLEARLY AND SHALL WE PROCEED TO GET RID OF THE WEEPINGS AND WAILINGS OF FAMOUS MEN THEY WILL GO WITH THE REST BUT SHALL WE BE RIGHT IN GETTING RID OF THEM REFLECT OUR PRINCIPLE IS THAT THE GOOD MAN WILL NOT CONSIDER DEATH TERRIBLE TO ANY OTHER GOOD MAN WHO IS HIS COMRADE
3368-170952-0012 AND MAKING THEM OVER TO WOMEN AND NOT EVEN TO WOMEN WHO ARE GOOD FOR ANYTHING OR TO MEN OF A BASER SORT THAT THOSE WHO ARE BEING EDUCATED BY US TO BE THE DEFENDERS OF THEIR COUNTRY MAY SCORN TO DO THE LIKE THAT WILL BE VERY RIGHT
3368-170952-0013 WHO IS THE SON OF A GODDESS FIRST LYING ON HIS SIDE THEN ON HIS BACK AND THEN ON HIS FACE THEN STARTING UP AND SAILING IN A FRENZY ALONG THE SHORES OF THE BARREN SEA NOW TAKING THE SOOTY ASHES IN BOTH HIS HANDS AND POURING THEM OVER HIS HEAD
3368-170952-0014 OR WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE VARIOUS MODES WHICH HOMER HAS DELINEATED NOR SHOULD HE DESCRIBE PRIAM THE KINSMAN OF THE GODS AS PRAYING AND BESEECHING ROLLING IN THE DIRT CALLING EACH MAN LOUDLY BY HIS NAME
3368-170952-0015 STILL MORE EARNESTLY WILL WE BEG OF HIM AT ALL EVENTS NOT TO INTRODUCE THE GODS LAMENTING AND SAYING ALAS MY MISERY ALAS THAT I BORE THE BRAVEST TO MY SORROW BUT IF HE MUST INTRODUCE THE GODS
3368-170952-0016 AT ANY RATE LET HIM NOT DARE SO COMPLETELY TO MISREPRESENT THE GREATEST OF THE GODS AS TO MAKE HIM SAY O HEAVENS WITH MY EYES VERILY I BEHOLD A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE CHASED ROUND AND ROUND THE CITY AND MY HEART IS SORROWFUL OR AGAIN
3368-170952-0017 OUR YOUTH SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO SUCH UNWORTHY REPRESENTATIONS OF THE GODS INSTEAD OF LAUGHING AT THEM AS THEY OUGHT HARDLY WILL ANY OF THEM DEEM THAT HE HIMSELF BEING BUT A MAN CAN BE DISHONOURED BY SIMILAR ACTIONS
3368-170952-0018 AND INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY SHAME OR SELF CONTROL HE WILL BE ALWAYS WHINING AND LAMENTING ON SLIGHT OCCASIONS YES HE SAID THAT IS MOST TRUE YES I REPLIED BUT THAT SURELY IS WHAT OUGHT NOT TO BE AS THE ARGUMENT HAS JUST PROVED TO US
3368-170952-0019 AND BY THAT PROOF WE MUST ABIDE UNTIL IT IS DISPROVED BY A BETTER IT OUGHT NOT TO BE NEITHER OUGHT OUR GUARDIANS TO BE GIVEN TO LAUGHTER FOR A FIT OF LAUGHTER WHICH HAS BEEN INDULGED TO EXCESS ALMOST ALWAYS PRODUCES A VIOLENT REACTION
3368-170952-0020 SO I BELIEVE THEN PERSONS OF WORTH EVEN IF ONLY MORTAL MEN MUST NOT BE REPRESENTED AS OVERCOME BY LAUGHTER AND STILL LESS MUST SUCH A REPRESENTATION OF THE GODS BE ALLOWED STILL LESS OF THE GODS AS YOU SAY HE REPLIED
3368-170952-0021 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER AROSE AMONG THE BLESSED GODS WHEN THEY SAW HEPHAESTUS BUSTLING ABOUT THE MANSION ON YOUR VIEWS WE MUST NOT ADMIT THEM ON MY VIEWS IF YOU LIKE TO FATHER THEM ON ME
3368-170952-0022 THAT WE MUST NOT ADMIT THEM IS CERTAIN AGAIN TRUTH SHOULD BE HIGHLY VALUED IF AS WE WERE SAYING A LIE IS USELESS TO THE GODS
3368-170952-0023 THEN THE USE OF SUCH MEDICINES SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO PHYSICIANS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THEM CLEARLY NOT HE SAID THEN IF ANY ONE AT ALL IS TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF LYING THE RULERS OF THE STATE SHOULD BE THE PERSONS AND THEY
3368-170952-0024 IN THEIR DEALINGS EITHER WITH ENEMIES OR WITH THEIR OWN CITIZENS MAY BE ALLOWED TO LIE FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD BUT NOBODY ELSE SHOULD MEDDLE WITH ANYTHING OF THE KIND AND ALTHOUGH THE RULERS HAVE THIS PRIVILEGE
3368-170952-0025 FOR A PRIVATE MAN TO LIE TO THEM IN RETURN IS TO BE DEEMED A MORE HEINOUS FAULT THAN FOR THE PATIENT OR THE PUPIL OF A GYMNASIUM NOT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS OWN BODILY ILLNESSES TO THE PHYSICIAN OR TO THE TRAINER
3368-170952-0026 AND HOW THINGS ARE GOING WITH HIMSELF OR HIS FELLOW SAILORS MOST TRUE HE SAID IF THEN
3368-170952-0027 ANY OF THE CRAFTSMEN WHETHER HE BE PRIEST OR PHYSICIAN OR CARPENTER HE WILL PUNISH HIM FOR INTRODUCING A PRACTICE WHICH IS EQUALLY SUBVERSIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE OF SHIP OR STATE MOST CERTAINLY HE SAID IF OUR IDEA OF THE STATE IS EVER CARRIED OUT
3368-170952-0028 IN THE NEXT PLACE OUR YOUTH MUST BE TEMPERATE CERTAINLY
3368-170952-0029 OBEDIENCE TO COMMANDERS AND SELF CONTROL IN SENSUAL PLEASURES TRUE
3368-170952-0030 WHETHER IN VERSE OR PROSE ARE WELL OR ILL SPOKEN THEY ARE ILL SPOKEN THEY MAY VERY POSSIBLY AFFORD SOME AMUSEMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONDUCE TO TEMPERANCE
3368-170952-0031 YES AND THEN AGAIN TO MAKE THE WISEST OF MEN SAY THAT NOTHING IN HIS OPINION IS MORE GLORIOUS THAN WHEN THE TABLES ARE FULL OF BREAD AND MEAT AND THE CUP BEARER CARRIES ROUND WINE WHICH HE DRAWS FROM THE BOWL AND POURS INTO THE CUPS
3368-170952-0032 BUT FORGOT THEM ALL IN A MOMENT THROUGH HIS LUST
3368-170952-0033 BUT WANTED TO LIE WITH HER ON THE GROUND DECLARING THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN SUCH A STATE OF RAPTURE BEFORE EVEN WHEN THEY FIRST MET ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PARENTS OR THAT OTHER TALE OF HOW HEPHAESTUS BECAUSE OF SIMILAR GOINGS ON
3368-170952-0034 INDEED HE SAID I AM STRONGLY OF OPINION THAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO HEAR THAT SORT OF THING BUT ANY DEEDS OF ENDURANCE WHICH ARE DONE OR TOLD BY FAMOUS MEN THESE THEY OUGHT TO SEE AND HEAR AS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS SAID IN THE VERSES
3368-170952-0035 NEITHER MUST WE SING TO THEM OF GIFTS PERSUADING GODS AND PERSUADING REVEREND KINGS NEITHER IS PHOENIX THE TUTOR OF ACHILLES
3368-170952-0036 TO BE APPROVED OR DEEMED TO HAVE GIVEN HIS PUPIL GOOD COUNSEL WHEN HE TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD TAKE THE GIFTS OF THE GREEKS AND ASSIST THEM BUT THAT WITHOUT A GIFT HE SHOULD NOT LAY ASIDE HIS ANGER
3368-170952-0037 I HARDLY LIKE TO SAY THAT IN ATTRIBUTING THESE FEELINGS TO ACHILLES OR IN BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE TRULY ATTRIBUTED TO HIM HE IS GUILTY OF DOWNRIGHT IMPIETY AS LITTLE CAN I BELIEVE THE NARRATIVE OF HIS INSOLENCE TO APOLLO WHERE HE SAYS THOU HAST WRONGED ME O FAR DARTER
3368-170952-0038 MOST ABOMINABLE OF DEITIES VERILY I WOULD BE EVEN WITH THEE
3368-170952-0039 OR HIS INSUBORDINATION TO THE RIVER GOD ON WHOSE DIVINITY HE IS READY TO LAY HANDS
3368-170952-0040 WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEDICATED TO THE OTHER RIVER GOD SPERCHEIUS AND THAT HE ACTUALLY PERFORMED THIS VOW OR THAT HE DRAGGED HECTOR ROUND THE TOMB OF PATROCLUS AND SLAUGHTERED THE CAPTIVES AT THE PYRE OF ALL THIS I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS GUILTY
3368-170952-0041 ANY MORE THAN I CAN ALLOW OUR CITIZENS TO BELIEVE THAT HE THE WISE CHEIRON'S PUPIL THE SON OF A GODDESS AND OF PELEUS WHO WAS THE GENTLEST OF MEN AND THIRD IN DESCENT FROM ZEUS WAS SO DISORDERED IN HIS WITS AS TO BE AT ONE TIME THE SLAVE OF TWO SEEMINGLY INCONSISTENT PASSIONS
3368-170952-0042 MEANNESS NOT UNTAINTED BY AVARICE COMBINED WITH OVERWEENING CONTEMPT OF GODS AND MEN YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT HE REPLIED AND LET US EQUALLY REFUSE TO BELIEVE OR ALLOW TO BE REPEATED THE TALE OF THESEUS SON OF POSEIDON
3368-170952-0043 AND LET US FURTHER COMPEL THE POETS TO DECLARE EITHER THAT THESE ACTS WERE NOT DONE BY THEM OR THAT THEY WERE NOT THE SONS OF GODS BOTH IN THE SAME BREATH THEY SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO AFFIRM WE WILL NOT HAVE THEM TRYING TO PERSUADE OUR YOUTH THAT THE GODS ARE THE AUTHORS OF EVIL
3368-170952-0044 AND THAT HEROES ARE NO BETTER THAN MEN SENTIMENTS WHICH AS WE WERE SAYING ARE NEITHER PIOUS NOR TRUE FOR WE HAVE ALREADY PROVED THAT EVIL CANNOT COME FROM THE GODS ASSUREDLY NOT AND FURTHER THEY ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A BAD EFFECT ON THOSE WHO HEAR THEM
3368-170952-0045 AND WHO HAVE THE BLOOD OF DEITIES YET FLOWING IN THEIR VEINS AND THEREFORE LET US PUT AN END TO SUCH TALES LEST THEY ENGENDER LAXITY OF MORALS AMONG THE YOUNG
3368-170952-0046 BUT NOW THAT WE ARE DETERMINING WHAT CLASSES OF SUBJECTS ARE OR ARE NOT TO BE SPOKEN OF LET US SEE WHETHER ANY HAVE BEEN OMITTED BY US
3368-170952-0047 WE SHALL HAVE TO SAY THAT ABOUT MEN POETS AND STORY TELLERS ARE GUILTY OF MAKING THE GRAVEST MISSTATEMENTS WHEN THEY TELL US THAT WICKED MEN ARE OFTEN HAPPY AND THE GOOD MISERABLE AND THAT INJUSTICE IS PROFITABLE WHEN UNDETECTED BUT THAT JUSTICE IS A MAN'S OWN LOSS AND ANOTHER'S GAIN
3368-170952-0048 THESE THINGS WE SHALL FORBID THEM TO UTTER AND COMMAND THEM TO SING AND SAY THE OPPOSITE TO BE SURE WE SHALL HE REPLIED BUT IF YOU ADMIT THAT I AM RIGHT IN THIS
