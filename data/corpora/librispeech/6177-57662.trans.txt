6177-57662-0000 COMMUNION UNDER ONE KIND OUR SAVIOR GAVE COMMUNION UNDER BOTH FORMS OF BREAD AND WINE TO HIS APOSTLES AT THE LAST SUPPER OFFICIATING BISHOPS AND PRIESTS ARE ALWAYS REQUIRED EXCEPT ON GOOD FRIDAY
6177-57662-0001 TO COMMUNICATE UNDER BOTH KINDS BUT EVEN THE CLERGY OF EVERY RANK INCLUDING THE POPE RECEIVE ONLY OF THE CONSECRATED BREAD UNLESS WHEN THEY CELEBRATE MASS THE CHURCH TEACHES THAT CHRIST IS CONTAINED WHOLE AND ENTIRE
6177-57662-0002 UNDER EACH SPECIES SO THAT WHOEVER COMMUNICATES UNDER THE FORM OF BREAD OR OF WINE RECEIVES NOT A MUTILATED SACRAMENT OR A DIVIDED SAVIOR BUT SHARES IN THE WHOLE SACRAMENT AS FULLY AS IF HE PARTICIPATED
6177-57662-0003 IN BOTH FORMS HENCE THE LAYMAN WHO RECEIVES THE CONSECRATED BREAD PARTAKES AS COPIOUSLY OF THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST AS THE OFFICIATING PRIEST WHO RECEIVES BOTH CONSECRATED ELEMENTS OUR LORD SAYS
6177-57662-0004 I AM THE LIVING BREAD WHICH CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IF ANY MAN EAT OF THIS BREAD HE SHALL LIVE FOREVER
6177-57662-0005 THAT THE PROTESTANT TRANSLATORS HAVE PERVERTED THE TEXT BY RENDERING IT WHOSOEVER SHALL EAT THIS BREAD AND DRINK THE CHALICE SUBSTITUTING AND FOR OR IN CONTRADICTION TO THE GREEK ORIGINAL
6177-57662-0006 OF WHICH THE CATHOLIC VERSION IS AN EXACT TRANSLATION IT IS ALSO THE RECEIVED DOCTRINE OF THE FATHERS THAT THE EUCHARIST IS CONTAINED IN ALL ITS INTEGRITY EITHER IN THE CONSECRATED BREAD OR IN THE CHALICE
6177-57662-0007 WAS SO CLEARLY CONVINCED OF THIS TRUTH THAT HE WAS AN UNCOMPROMISING ADVOCATE OF COMMUNION UNDER ONE KIND IF ANY COUNCIL HE SAYS SHOULD DECREE OR PERMIT BOTH SPECIES
6177-57662-0008 DRINK YE ALL OF THIS BUT IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED NOT TO THE PEOPLE AT LARGE BUT ONLY TO THE APOSTLES WHO ALONE WERE ALSO COMMANDED ON THE SAME OCCASION TO CONSECRATE HIS BODY AND BLOOD
6177-57662-0009 IN REMEMBRANCE OF HIM NOW WE HAVE NO MORE RIGHT TO INFER THAT THE FAITHFUL ARE OBLIGED TO DRINK OF THE CUP BECAUSE THE APOSTLES WERE COMMANDED TO DRINK OF IT THAN WE HAVE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE LAITY ARE REQUIRED OR ALLOWED
6177-57662-0010 TO CONSECRATE THE BREAD AND WINE BECAUSE THE POWER OF DOING SO WAS AT THE LAST SUPPER CONFERRED ON THE APOSTLES IT IS TRUE ALSO THAT OUR LORD SAID TO THE PEOPLE
6177-57662-0011 UNLESS YE EAT THE FLESH OF THE SON OF MAN AND DRINK HIS BLOOD YE SHALL NOT HAVE LIFE IN YOU BUT THIS COMMAND IS LITERALLY FULFILLED BY THE LAITY WHEN THEY PARTAKE OF THE CONSECRATED BREAD WHICH AS WE HAVE SEEN
6177-57662-0012 CONTAINS CHRIST THE LORD IN ALL HIS INTEGRITY HENCE IF OUR SAVIOR HAS SAID WHOSO EATETH MY FLESH AND DRINKETH MY BLOOD HATH EVERLASTING LIFE HE HAS ALSO SAID
6177-57662-0013 THE BREAD WHICH I WILL GIVE IS MY FLESH FOR THE LIFE OF THE WORLD IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE CHARGE OF WITHHOLDING THE CUP COMES WITH VERY BAD GRACE FROM PROTESTANT TEACHERS
6177-57662-0014 WHO DESTROY THE WHOLE INTRINSIC VIRTUE OF THE SACRAMENT BY GIVING TO THEIR FOLLOWERS NOTHING BUT BREAD AND WINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND US LIES IN THIS THAT UNDER ONE FORM WE GIVE THE SUBSTANCE
6177-57662-0015 CONFESSEDLY GIVE ONLY THE SHADOW IN EXAMINING THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH ON THE SUBJECT WE FIND THAT UP TO THE TWELFTH CENTURY COMMUNION WAS SOMETIMES DISTRIBUTED IN ONE FORM SOMETIMES IN ANOTHER
6177-57662-0016 THE CHRISTIANS IN TIME OF PERSECUTION CONFESSORS OF THE FAITH CONFINED IN PRISON TRAVELLERS ON THEIR JOURNEY SOLDIERS BEFORE ENGAGING IN BATTLE AND HERMITS LIVING IN THE DESERT
6177-57662-0017 WERE PERMITTED TO KEEP WITH THEM AND TO FORTIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE CONSECRATED BREAD
6177-57662-0018 THAN PERMIT THEM TO PARTAKE OF A MUTILATED SACRAMENT SECOND IN THE PRIMITIVE DAYS OF THE CHURCH THE HOLY COMMUNION USED TO BE IMPARTED TO INFANTS BUT ONLY IN THE FORM OF WINE THE PRIEST DIPPED HIS FINGER IN THE CONSECRATED CHALICE
6177-57662-0019 USUALLY ADMINISTERED IN THE FIRST AGES UNDER BOTH FORMS THE FAITHFUL HOWEVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF DISPENSING WITH THE CUP AND OF PARTAKING ONLY OF THE BREAD
6177-57662-0020 IN THE FIFTH CENTURY WHEN THIS GENERAL BUT HITHERTO OPTIONAL PRACTICE OF RECEIVING UNDER BOTH KINDS WAS ENFORCED AS A LAW FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON THE MANICHEAN SECT ABSTAINED FROM THE CUP ON THE ERRONEOUS ASSUMPTION THAT THE USE OF WINE WAS SINFUL
6177-57662-0021 LEFT IT NO LONGER OPTIONAL WITH THE FAITHFUL TO RECEIVE UNDER ONE OR BOTH FORMS BUT ORDAINED THAT ALL SHOULD COMMUNICATE UNDER BOTH KINDS THIS LAW CONTINUED IN FORCE FOR SEVERAL AGES BUT TOWARDS THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY
6177-57662-0022 FOR VARIOUS CAUSES IT HAD GRADUALLY GROWN INTO DISUSE WITH THE TACIT APPROVAL OF THE CHURCH THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE WHICH CONVENED IN FOURTEEN FOURTEEN ESTABLISHED A LAW REQUIRING THE FAITHFUL TO COMMUNICATE UNDER THE FORM OF BREAD ONLY
6177-57662-0023 AND IN TAKING THIS STEP THE COUNCIL WAS ACTUATED
6177-57662-0024 SUCH INCONVENIENCE IS SCARCELY FELT BY PROTESTANT COMMUNICANTS WHOSE NUMBERS ARE LIMITED AND WHO ORDINARILY COMMUNICATE ONLY ON CERTAIN SUNDAYS OF EACH MONTH THE CATHOLICS OF THE WORLD ON THE CONTRARY NUMBER ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLIONS
6177-57662-0025 AND AS COMMUNION IS ADMINISTERED TO SOME OF THE FAITHFUL ALMOST EVERY DAY IN MOST OF OUR CHURCHES AND CHAPELS AND AS THE ANNUAL COMMUNIONS IN EVERY PARISH CHURCH ARE GENERALLY AT LEAST TWICE AS NUMEROUS
6177-57662-0026 THE SUM TOTAL OF ANNUAL COMMUNIONS THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE MAY BE ESTIMATED IN ROUND NUMBERS AT NOT LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLIONS WHAT EFFORT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROCURE ALTAR WINE FOR SUCH A MULTITUDE
6177-57662-0027 IN MY MISSIONARY JOURNEYS THROUGH NORTH CAROLINA I HAVE OFTEN FOUND IT NO EASY TASK TO PROVIDE FOR THE CELEBRATION OF MASS A SUFFICIENCY OF PURE WINE
6177-57662-0028 THIS EMBARRASSMENT WOULD BE INCREASED BEYOND MEASURE
6177-57662-0029 IF THE SACRAMENT WERE ADMINISTERED IN BOTH FORMS IN OUR LARGER CHURCHES WHERE COMMUNION IS DISTRIBUTED EVERY SUNDAY TO HUNDREDS THERE WOULD BE GREAT DANGER OF SPILLING A PORTION OF THE CONSECRATED CHALICE
6177-57662-0030 AND OF THUS EXPOSING IT TO PROFANATION BUT ABOVE ALL AS THE CHURCH IN THE FIFTH CENTURY THROUGH HER CHIEF PASTOR
6177-57662-0031 ENFORCED THE USE OF THE CUP TO EXPOSE AND REPROBATE THE ERROR OF THE MANICHEES WHO IMAGINED THAT THE USE OF WINE WAS SINFUL SO IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY SHE WITHDREW THE CUP TO CONDEMN THE NOVELTIES OF THE CALIXTINES
6177-57662-0032 WHO TAUGHT THAT THE CONSECRATED WINE WAS NECESSARY FOR A VALID COMMUNION
