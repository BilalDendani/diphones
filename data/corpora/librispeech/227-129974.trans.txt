227-129974-0000 MISSUS DASHWOOD'S VISIT TO LADY MIDDLETON TOOK PLACE THE NEXT DAY AND TWO OF HER DAUGHTERS WENT WITH HER BUT MARIANNE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM BEING OF THE PARTY UNDER SOME TRIFLING PRETEXT OF EMPLOYMENT
227-129974-0001 AND HER MOTHER WHO CONCLUDED THAT A PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE BY WILLOUGHBY THE NIGHT BEFORE OF CALLING ON HER
227-129974-0002 WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HER REMAINING AT HOME ON THEIR RETURN FROM THE PARK THEY FOUND WILLOUGHBY'S CURRICLE AND SERVANT IN WAITING AT THE COTTAGE AND MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS CONVINCED THAT HER CONJECTURE HAD BEEN JUST
227-129974-0003 SO FAR IT WAS ALL AS SHE HAD FORESEEN BUT ON ENTERING THE HOUSE SHE BEHELD WHAT NO FORESIGHT HAD TAUGHT HER TO EXPECT THEY WERE NO SOONER IN THE PASSAGE THAN MARIANNE CAME HASTILY OUT OF THE PARLOUR APPARENTLY IN VIOLENT AFFLICTION
227-129974-0004 WHERE THEY FOUND ONLY WILLOUGHBY WHO WAS LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL PIECE WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THEM HE TURNED ROUND ON THEIR COMING IN AND HIS COUNTENANCE SHEWED THAT HE STRONGLY PARTOOK OF THE EMOTION WHICH OVER POWERED MARIANNE
227-129974-0005 IS SHE ILL I HOPE NOT HE REPLIED
227-129974-0006 IT IS I WHO MAY RATHER EXPECT TO BE ILL FOR I AM NOW SUFFERING UNDER A VERY HEAVY DISAPPOINTMENT DISAPPOINTMENT YES FOR I AM UNABLE TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU
227-129974-0007 ARE YOU GOING THIS MORNING ALMOST THIS MOMENT THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE
227-129974-0008 HE COLOURED AS HE REPLIED YOU ARE VERY KIND BUT I HAVE NO IDEA OF RETURNING INTO DEVONSHIRE IMMEDIATELY MY VISITS TO MISSUS SMITH ARE NEVER REPEATED WITHIN THE TWELVEMONTH
227-129974-0009 AND IS MISSUS SMITH YOUR ONLY FRIEND IS ALLENHAM THE ONLY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO WHICH YOU WILL BE WELCOME FOR SHAME WILLOUGHBY CAN YOU WAIT FOR AN INVITATION HERE
227-129974-0010 AND WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND HE ONLY REPLIED YOU ARE TOO GOOD MISSUS DASHWOOD LOOKED AT ELINOR WITH SURPRISE ELINOR FELT EQUAL AMAZEMENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS
227-129974-0011 EVERY ONE WAS SILENT MISSUS DASHWOOD FIRST SPOKE I HAVE ONLY TO ADD MY DEAR WILLOUGHBY
227-129974-0012 FOR I WILL NOT PRESS YOU TO RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE YOU ONLY CAN JUDGE HOW FAR THAT MIGHT BE PLEASING TO MISSUS SMITH AND ON THIS HEAD I SHALL BE NO MORE DISPOSED TO QUESTION YOUR JUDGMENT THAN TO DOUBT YOUR INCLINATION
227-129974-0013 MY ENGAGEMENTS AT PRESENT REPLIED WILLOUGHBY CONFUSEDLY ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT I DARE NOT FLATTER MYSELF HE STOPT MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS TOO MUCH ASTONISHED TO SPEAK
227-129974-0014 AND ANOTHER PAUSE SUCCEEDED THIS WAS BROKEN BY WILLOUGHBY WHO SAID WITH A FAINT SMILE IT IS FOLLY TO LINGER IN THIS MANNER I WILL NOT TORMENT MYSELF ANY LONGER BY REMAINING AMONG FRIENDS WHOSE SOCIETY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOW TO ENJOY
227-129974-0015 THEY SAW HIM STEP INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND IN A MINUTE IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT MISSUS DASHWOOD FELT TOO MUCH FOR SPEECH AND INSTANTLY QUITTED THE PARLOUR TO GIVE WAY IN SOLITUDE TO THE CONCERN AND ALARM
227-129974-0016 WHICH THIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE OCCASIONED ELINOR'S UNEASINESS WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO HER MOTHER'S SHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD JUST PASSED WITH ANXIETY AND DISTRUST
227-129974-0017 WILLOUGHBY'S BEHAVIOUR IN TAKING LEAVE OF THEM HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND AFFECTATION OF CHEERFULNESS AND ABOVE ALL HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT HER MOTHER'S INVITATION A BACKWARDNESS SO UNLIKE A LOVER SO UNLIKE HIMSELF GREATLY DISTURBED HER
227-129974-0018 ONE MOMENT SHE FEARED THAT NO SERIOUS DESIGN HAD EVER BEEN FORMED ON HIS SIDE AND THE NEXT THAT SOME UNFORTUNATE QUARREL HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER SISTER
227-129974-0019 THE DISTRESS IN WHICH MARIANNE HAD QUITTED THE ROOM WAS SUCH AS A SERIOUS QUARREL COULD MOST REASONABLY ACCOUNT FOR THOUGH WHEN SHE CONSIDERED WHAT MARIANNE'S LOVE FOR HIM WAS A QUARREL SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
227-129974-0020 BUT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR SEPARATION
227-129974-0021 SAID SHE AS SHE SAT DOWN TO WORK AND WITH HOW HEAVY A HEART DOES HE TRAVEL IT IS ALL VERY STRANGE
227-129974-0022 IT SEEMS BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT AND LAST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US SO HAPPY SO CHEERFUL SO AFFECTIONATE AND NOW AFTER ONLY TEN MINUTES NOTICE GONE TOO WITHOUT INTENDING TO RETURN
227-129974-0023 HE DID NOT SPEAK HE DID NOT BEHAVE LIKE HIMSELF YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE DIFFERENCE AS WELL AS I WHAT CAN IT BE CAN THEY HAVE QUARRELLED WHY ELSE SHOULD HE HAVE SHEWN SUCH UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION HERE
227-129974-0024 IT WAS NOT INCLINATION THAT HE WANTED ELINOR I COULD PLAINLY SEE THAT HE HAD NOT THE POWER OF ACCEPTING IT I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER I ASSURE YOU
227-129974-0025 AND I CAN PERFECTLY ACCOUNT FOR EVERY THING THAT AT FIRST SEEMED STRANGE TO ME AS WELL AS TO YOU CAN YOU INDEED YES
227-129974-0026 BUT YOU ELINOR WHO LOVE TO DOUBT WHERE YOU CAN IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOU I KNOW BUT YOU SHALL NOT TALK ME OUT OF MY TRUST IN IT I AM PERSUADED THAT MISSUS SMITH SUSPECTS HIS REGARD FOR MARIANNE DISAPPROVES OF IT
227-129974-0027 PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE HAS OTHER VIEWS FOR HIM AND ON THAT ACCOUNT IS EAGER TO GET HIM AWAY AND THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH SHE SENDS HIM OFF TO TRANSACT IS INVENTED AS AN EXCUSE TO DISMISS HIM
227-129974-0028 HE IS MOREOVER AWARE THAT SHE DOES DISAPPROVE THE CONNECTION HE DARES NOT THEREFORE AT PRESENT CONFESS TO HER HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH MARIANNE AND HE FEELS HIMSELF OBLIGED
227-129974-0029 AND ABSENT HIMSELF FROM DEVONSHIRE FOR A WHILE YOU WILL TELL ME I KNOW THAT THIS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT I WILL LISTEN TO NO CAVIL UNLESS YOU CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER METHOD OF UNDERSTANDING THE AFFAIR AS SATISFACTORY AT THIS
227-129974-0030 AND NOW ELINOR WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY NOTHING FOR YOU HAVE ANTICIPATED MY ANSWER THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED
227-129974-0031 AND IS NO ALLOWANCE TO BE MADE FOR INADVERTENCE OR FOR SPIRITS DEPRESSED BY RECENT DISAPPOINTMENT
227-129974-0032 AND NO REASON IN THE WORLD TO THINK ILL OF TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MOTIVES UNANSWERABLE IN THEMSELVES THOUGH UNAVOIDABLY SECRET FOR A WHILE AND AFTER ALL WHAT IS IT YOU SUSPECT HIM OF
227-129974-0033 I CAN HARDLY TELL MYSELF BUT SUSPICION OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT IS THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AN ALTERATION AS WE JUST WITNESSED IN HIM
227-129974-0034 THERE IS GREAT TRUTH HOWEVER IN WHAT YOU HAVE NOW URGED OF THE ALLOWANCES WHICH OUGHT TO BE MADE FOR HIM AND IT IS MY WISH TO BE CANDID IN MY JUDGMENT OF EVERY BODY WILLOUGHBY MAY UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE VERY SUFFICIENT REASONS FOR HIS CONDUCT
227-129974-0035 AND I WILL HOPE THAT HE HAS BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE WILLOUGHBY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AT ONCE SECRECY MAY BE ADVISABLE BUT STILL I CANNOT HELP WONDERING AT ITS BEING PRACTICED BY HIM
227-129974-0036 DO NOT BLAME HIM HOWEVER FOR DEPARTING FROM HIS CHARACTER WHERE THE DEVIATION IS NECESSARY BUT YOU REALLY DO ADMIT THE JUSTICE OF WHAT I HAVE SAID IN HIS DEFENCE I AM HAPPY AND HE IS ACQUITTED NOT ENTIRELY
227-129974-0037 IT MAY BE PROPER TO CONCEAL THEIR ENGAGEMENT IF THEY ARE ENGAGED FROM MISSUS SMITH AND IF THAT IS THE CASE
227-129974-0038 I WANT NO PROOF OF THEIR AFFECTION SAID ELINOR BUT OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT I DO I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED OF BOTH YET NOT A SYLLABLE HAS BEEN SAID TO YOU ON THE SUBJECT BY EITHER OF THEM
227-129974-0039 I HAVE NOT WANTED SYLLABLES WHERE ACTIONS HAVE SPOKEN SO PLAINLY HAS NOT HIS BEHAVIOUR TO MARIANNE AND TO ALL OF US FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FORTNIGHT DECLARED THAT HE LOVED AND CONSIDERED HER AS HIS FUTURE WIFE
227-129974-0040 AND THAT HE FELT FOR US THE ATTACHMENT OF THE NEAREST RELATION HAVE WE NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER HAS NOT MY CONSENT BEEN DAILY ASKED BY HIS LOOKS HIS MANNER HIS ATTENTIVE AND AFFECTIONATE RESPECT
227-129974-0041 SHOULD LEAVE HER AND LEAVE HER PERHAPS FOR MONTHS WITHOUT TELLING HER OF HIS AFFECTION THAT THEY SHOULD PART WITHOUT A MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF CONFIDENCE I CONFESS REPLIED ELINOR
227-129974-0042 THAT EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE EXCEPT ONE IS IN FAVOUR OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT BUT THAT ONE IS THE TOTAL SILENCE OF BOTH ON THE SUBJECT AND WITH ME IT ALMOST OUTWEIGHS EVERY OTHER HOW STRANGE THIS IS
227-129974-0043 YOU MUST THINK WRETCHEDLY INDEED OF WILLOUGHBY IF AFTER ALL THAT HAS OPENLY PASSED BETWEEN THEM YOU CAN DOUBT THE NATURE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY ARE TOGETHER HAS HE BEEN ACTING A PART IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO YOUR SISTER ALL THIS TIME
227-129974-0044 DO YOU SUPPOSE HIM REALLY INDIFFERENT TO HER NO I CANNOT THINK THAT HE MUST AND DOES LOVE HER I AM SURE BUT WITH A STRANGE KIND OF TENDERNESS IF HE CAN LEAVE HER WITH SUCH INDIFFERENCE
227-129974-0045 SUCH CARELESSNESS OF THE FUTURE AS YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM YOU MUST REMEMBER MY DEAR MOTHER THAT I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THIS MATTER AS CERTAIN I HAVE HAD MY DOUBTS I CONFESS BUT THEY ARE FAINTER THAN THEY WERE
227-129974-0046 AND THEY MAY SOON BE ENTIRELY DONE AWAY IF WE FIND THEY CORRESPOND EVERY FEAR OF MINE WILL BE REMOVED A MIGHTY CONCESSION INDEED IF YOU WERE TO SEE THEM AT THE ALTAR
227-129974-0047 YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THEY WERE GOING TO BE MARRIED UNGRACIOUS GIRL BUT I REQUIRE NO SUCH PROOF NOTHING IN MY OPINION HAS EVER PASSED TO JUSTIFY DOUBT NO SECRECY HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED ALL HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY OPEN AND UNRESERVED
227-129974-0048 YOU CANNOT DOUBT YOUR SISTER'S WISHES IT MUST BE WILLOUGHBY THEREFORE WHOM YOU SUSPECT BUT WHY IS HE NOT A MAN OF HONOUR AND FEELING HAS THERE BEEN ANY INCONSISTENCY ON HIS SIDE TO CREATE ALARM CAN HE BE DECEITFUL
227-129974-0049 I HOPE NOT I BELIEVE NOT CRIED ELINOR I LOVE WILLOUGHBY SINCERELY LOVE HIM AND SUSPICION OF HIS INTEGRITY CANNOT BE MORE PAINFUL TO YOURSELF THAN TO ME IT HAS BEEN INVOLUNTARY
227-129974-0050 BUT ALL THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY SUCH A SITUATION OF HIS AFFAIRS AS YOU HAVE SUPPOSED HE HAD JUST PARTED FROM MY SISTER HAD SEEN HER LEAVE HIM IN THE GREATEST AFFLICTION AND IF HE FELT OBLIGED FROM A FEAR OF OFFENDING MISSUS SMITH
227-129974-0051 IN SUCH A CASE A PLAIN AND OPEN AVOWAL OF HIS DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS HONOUR I THINK AS WELL AS MORE CONSISTENT WITH HIS GENERAL CHARACTER BUT I WILL NOT RAISE OBJECTIONS AGAINST ANY ONE'S CONDUCT ON SO ILLIBERAL A FOUNDATION
227-129974-0052 AS A DIFFERENCE IN JUDGMENT FROM MYSELF OR A DEVIATION FROM WHAT I MAY THINK RIGHT AND CONSISTENT YOU SPEAK VERY PROPERLY WILLOUGHBY CERTAINLY DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE SUSPECTED
227-129974-0053 THOUGH WE HAVE NOT KNOWN HIM LONG HE IS NO STRANGER IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND WHO HAS EVER SPOKEN TO HIS DISADVANTAGE HAD HE BEEN IN A SITUATION TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND MARRY IMMEDIATELY
227-129974-0054 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ODD THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE US WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING EVERYTHING TO ME AT ONCE BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT IN SOME RESPECTS NOT PROSPEROUSLY BEGUN FOR THEIR MARRIAGE MUST BE AT A VERY UNCERTAIN DISTANCE
227-129974-0055 AND EVEN SECRECY AS FAR AS IT CAN BE OBSERVED MAY NOW BE VERY ADVISABLE THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTRANCE OF MARGARET AND ELINOR WAS THEN AT LIBERTY TO THINK OVER THE REPRESENTATIONS OF HER MOTHER
227-129974-0056 AND IT SEEMED AS IF HER TEARS WERE EVEN THEN RESTRAINED WITH DIFFICULTY SHE AVOIDED THE LOOKS OF THEM ALL COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SPEAK AND AFTER SOME TIME ON HER MOTHER'S SILENTLY PRESSING HER HAND WITH TENDER COMPASSION HER SMALL DEGREE OF FORTITUDE
227-129974-0057 WAS QUITE OVERCOME SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND LEFT THE ROOM THIS VIOLENT OPPRESSION OF SPIRITS CONTINUED THE WHOLE EVENING SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY POWER BECAUSE SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE OF COMMAND OVER HERSELF
227-129974-0058 THE SLIGHTEST MENTION OF ANYTHING RELATIVE TO WILLOUGHBY OVERPOWERED HER IN AN INSTANT
