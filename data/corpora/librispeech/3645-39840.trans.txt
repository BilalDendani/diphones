3645-39840-0000 TWO CLERKS WERE WRITING AT TABLES WITH SCRATCHING PENS THE APPURTENANCES OF THE WRITING TABLES ABOUT WHICH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH WAS HIMSELF VERY FASTIDIOUS WERE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD HE COULD NOT HELP OBSERVING THIS
3645-39840-0001 AND HE POINTED WITH HIS PEN AT THE PERSONS WAITING AND WENT ON WRITING CAN'T HE SPARE TIME TO SEE ME SAID ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HE HAS NO TIME FREE HE IS ALWAYS BUSY KINDLY WAIT YOUR TURN
3645-39840-0002 ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH WAS IN PRINCIPLE IN FAVOR OF THE PUBLICITY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THOUGH FOR SOME HIGHER OFFICIAL CONSIDERATIONS HE DISLIKED THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE IN RUSSIA
3645-39840-0003 AND DISAPPROVED OF IT AS FAR AS HE COULD DISAPPROVE OF ANYTHING INSTITUTED BY AUTHORITY OF THE EMPEROR HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN SPENT IN ADMINISTRATIVE WORK AND CONSEQUENTLY WHEN HE DID NOT APPROVE OF ANYTHING
3645-39840-0004 HIS DISAPPROVAL WAS SOFTENED BY THE RECOGNITION OF THE INEVITABILITY OF MISTAKES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF REFORM IN EVERY DEPARTMENT
3645-39840-0005 BUT TILL THEN HE HAD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LAW COURTS AND SO HAD DISAPPROVED OF THEIR PUBLICITY SIMPLY IN THEORY NOW HIS DISAPPROBATION WAS STRENGTHENED BY THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION MADE ON HIM IN THE LAWYER'S WAITING ROOM
3645-39840-0006 COMING IMMEDIATELY SAID THE CLERK AND TWO MINUTES LATER THERE DID ACTUALLY APPEAR IN THE DOORWAY THE LARGE FIGURE OF AN OLD SOLICITOR WHO HAD BEEN CONSULTING WITH THE LAWYER HIMSELF
3645-39840-0007 THE LAWYER WAS A LITTLE SQUAT BALD MAN WITH A DARK REDDISH BEARD LIGHT COLORED LONG EYEBROWS AND AN OVERHANGING BROW HE WAS ATTIRED AS THOUGH FOR A WEDDING
3645-39840-0008 HIS FACE WAS CLEVER AND MANLY BUT HIS DRESS WAS DANDIFIED AND IN BAD TASTE PRAY WALK IN SAID THE LAWYER ADDRESSING ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH AND GLOOMILY USHERING KARENIN IN BEFORE HIM HE CLOSED THE DOOR
3645-39840-0009 WON'T YOU SIT DOWN HE INDICATED AN ARMCHAIR AT A WRITING TABLE COVERED WITH PAPERS HE SAT DOWN HIMSELF AND RUBBING HIS LITTLE HANDS WITH SHORT FINGERS COVERED WITH WHITE HAIRS HE BENT HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE
3645-39840-0010 OPENED HIS HANDS CAUGHT THE MOTH AND RESUMED HIS FORMER ATTITUDE BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK OF MY BUSINESS SAID ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH FOLLOWING THE LAWYER'S MOVEMENTS WITH WONDERING EYES I OUGHT TO OBSERVE THAT THE BUSINESS ABOUT WHICH I HAVE TO SPEAK TO YOU IS TO BE STRICTLY PRIVATE
3645-39840-0011 I SHOULD NOT BE A LAWYER IF I COULD NOT KEEP THE SECRETS CONFIDED TO ME BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE PROOF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH GLANCED AT HIS FACE AND SAW THAT THE SHREWD GRAY EYES WERE LAUGHING AND SEEMED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT ALREADY
3645-39840-0012 YOU KNOW MY NAME ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH RESUMED I KNOW YOU AND THE GOOD AGAIN HE CAUGHT A MOTH WORK YOU ARE DOING LIKE EVERY RUSSIAN SAID THE LAWYER BOWING ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SIGHED
3645-39840-0013 PLUCKING UP HIS COURAGE BUT HAVING ONCE MADE UP HIS MIND HE WENT ON IN HIS SHRILL VOICE WITHOUT TIMIDITY OR HESITATION ACCENTUATING HERE AND THERE A WORD I HAVE THE MISFORTUNE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH BEGAN
3645-39840-0014 TO HAVE BEEN DECEIVED IN MY MARRIED LIFE AND I DESIRE TO BREAK OFF ALL RELATIONS WITH MY WIFE BY LEGAL MEANS THAT IS TO BE DIVORCED BUT TO DO THIS SO THAT MY SON MAY NOT REMAIN WITH HIS MOTHER
3645-39840-0015 THE LAWYER'S GRAY EYES TRIED NOT TO LAUGH BUT THEY WERE DANCING WITH IRREPRESSIBLE GLEE AND ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SAW THAT IT WAS NOT SIMPLY THE DELIGHT OF A MAN WHO HAS JUST GOT A PROFITABLE JOB THERE WAS TRIUMPH AND JOY
3645-39840-0016 THERE WAS A GLEAM LIKE THE MALIGNANT GLEAM HE SAW IN HIS WIFE'S EYES YOU DESIRE MY ASSISTANCE IN SECURING A DIVORCE YES PRECISELY SO BUT I OUGHT TO WARN YOU THAT I MAY BE WASTING YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION
3645-39840-0017 I HAVE COME SIMPLY TO CONSULT YOU AS A PRELIMINARY STEP I WANT A DIVORCE BUT THE FORM IN WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE IS OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE TO ME IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT IF THAT FORM DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH MY REQUIREMENTS I MAY GIVE UP A LEGAL DIVORCE
3645-39840-0018 OH THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE SAID THE LAWYER AND THAT'S ALWAYS FOR YOU TO DECIDE HE LET HIS EYES REST ON ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S FEET FEELING THAT HE MIGHT OFFEND HIS CLIENT BY THE SIGHT OF HIS IRREPRESSIBLE AMUSEMENT
3645-39840-0019 I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE AN IDEA OF THE FORMS IN WHICH SUCH THINGS ARE DONE IN PRACTICE YOU WOULD BE GLAD THE LAWYER WITHOUT LIFTING HIS EYES RESPONDED ADOPTING WITH A CERTAIN SATISFACTION THE TONE OF HIS CLIENT'S REMARKS
3645-39840-0020 FOR ME TO LAY BEFORE YOU ALL THE METHODS BY WHICH YOU COULD SECURE WHAT YOU DESIRE AND ON RECEIVING AN ASSURING NOD FROM ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HE WENT ON STEALING A GLANCE NOW AND THEN AT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S FACE WHICH WAS GROWING RED IN PATCHES
3645-39840-0021 SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM AND SAT DOWN AGAIN IN THE FOLLOWING CASES PHYSICAL DEFECT IN THE MARRIED PARTIES DESERTION WITHOUT COMMUNICATION FOR FIVE YEARS HE SAID CROOKING A SHORT FINGER COVERED WITH HAIR ADULTERY
3645-39840-0022 THIS WORD HE PRONOUNCED WITH OBVIOUS SATISFACTION SUBDIVIDED AS FOLLOWS HE CONTINUED TO CROOK HIS FAT FINGERS THOUGH THE THREE CASES AND THEIR SUBDIVISIONS COULD OBVIOUSLY NOT BE CLASSIFIED TOGETHER PHYSICAL DEFECT OF THE HUSBAND OR OF THE WIFE
3645-39840-0023 AS BY NOW ALL HIS FINGERS WERE USED UP HE UNCROOKED ALL HIS FINGERS AND WENT ON THIS IS THE THEORETICAL VIEW BUT I IMAGINE YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO APPLY TO ME IN ORDER TO LEARN ITS APPLICATION IN PRACTICE
3645-39840-0024 AND THEREFORE GUIDED BY PRECEDENTS I MUST INFORM YOU THAT IN PRACTICE CASES OF DIVORCE MAY ALL BE REDUCED TO THE FOLLOWING THERE'S NO PHYSICAL DEFECT I MAY ASSUME NOR DESERTION
3645-39840-0025 ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH BOWED HIS HEAD IN ASSENT MAY BE REDUCED TO THE FOLLOWING ADULTERY OF ONE OF THE MARRIED PARTIES AND THE DETECTION IN THE FACT OF THE GUILTY PARTY BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT AND FAILING SUCH AGREEMENT
3645-39840-0026 ACCIDENTAL DETECTION IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE LATTER CASE IS RARELY MET WITH IN PRACTICE SAID THE LAWYER AND STEALING A GLANCE AT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HE PAUSED AS A MAN SELLING PISTOLS AFTER ENLARGING ON THE ADVANTAGES OF EACH WEAPON
3645-39840-0027 MIGHT AWAIT HIS CUSTOMER'S CHOICE BUT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SAID NOTHING AND THEREFORE THE LAWYER WENT ON THE MOST USUAL AND SIMPLE THE SENSIBLE COURSE I CONSIDER IS ADULTERY BY MUTUAL CONSENT
3645-39840-0028 SO PERTURBED THAT HE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY COMPREHEND ALL THE GOOD SENSE OF ADULTERY BY MUTUAL CONSENT AND HIS EYES EXPRESSED THIS UNCERTAINTY BUT THE LAWYER PROMPTLY CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE PEOPLE CANNOT GO ON LIVING TOGETHER HERE YOU HAVE A FACT
3645-39840-0029 AND IF BOTH ARE AGREED ABOUT IT THE DETAILS AND FORMALITIES BECOME A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE AND AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS THE SIMPLEST AND MOST CERTAIN METHOD ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH FULLY UNDERSTOOD NOW
3645-39840-0030 BUT HE HAD RELIGIOUS SCRUPLES WHICH HINDERED THE EXECUTION OF SUCH A PLAN THAT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION IN THE PRESENT CASE HE SAID ONLY ONE ALTERNATIVE IS POSSIBLE UNDESIGNED DETECTION SUPPORTED BY LETTERS WHICH I HAVE
3645-39840-0031 LETTERS MAY OF COURSE BE A PARTIAL CONFIRMATION BUT DETECTION IN THE FACT THERE MUST BE OF THE MOST DIRECT KIND THAT IS BY EYEWITNESSES IN FACT IF YOU DO ME THE HONOR TO INTRUST YOUR CONFIDENCE TO ME
3645-39840-0032 IF ONE WANTS THE RESULT ONE MUST ADMIT THE MEANS IF IT IS SO ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH BEGAN SUDDENLY TURNING WHITE BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE LAWYER ROSE AND AGAIN WENT TO THE DOOR TO SPEAK TO THE INTRUDING CLERK
3645-39840-0033 ON HIS WAY BACK HE CAUGHT UNOBSERVED ANOTHER MOTH NICE STATE MY REP CURTAINS WILL BE IN BY THE SUMMER HE THOUGHT FROWNING AND SO YOU WERE SAYING HE SAID
3645-39840-0034 I WILL COMMUNICATE MY DECISION TO YOU BY LETTER SAID ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH GETTING UP AND HE CLUTCHED AT THE TABLE AFTER STANDING A MOMENT IN SILENCE HE SAID FROM YOUR WORDS I MAY CONSEQUENTLY CONCLUDE THAT A DIVORCE MAY BE OBTAINED
3645-39840-0035 I WOULD ASK YOU TO LET ME KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR TERMS IT MAY BE OBTAINED IF YOU GIVE ME COMPLETE LIBERTY OF ACTION SAID THE LAWYER NOT ANSWERING HIS QUESTION WHEN CAN I RECKON ON RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM YOU HE ASKED MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR
3645-39840-0036 HIS EYES AND HIS VARNISHED BOOTS SHINING IN A WEEK'S TIME YOUR ANSWER AS TO WHETHER YOU WILL UNDERTAKE TO CONDUCT THE CASE AND ON WHAT TERMS YOU WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO COMMUNICATE TO ME VERY GOOD
