2269-88761-0000 MY SECOND STAGE BEAR NOT FALSE WITNESS SLANDER NOT NOR LIE TRUTH IS THE SPEECH OF INWARD PURITY THE LIGHT OF ASIA
2269-88761-0001 IN MY FIRST STAGE THE READER WILL PERCEIVE THAT I WAS A COMPARATIVELY WEAK AND HARMLESS LITTLE SLANDER WITH MERELY THAT TAINT OF ORIGINAL SIN WHICH WAS TO BE EXPECTED IN ONE OF SUCH PARENTAGE
2269-88761-0002 BUT I DEVELOPED WITH GREAT RAPIDITY AND I BELIEVE MEN OF SCIENCE WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH LOW ORGANISMS THAT FOR INSTANCE WHILE IT TAKES YEARS TO DEVELOP THE MAN FROM THE BABY AND MONTHS TO DEVELOP THE DOG FROM THE PUPPY
2269-88761-0003 THE BABY MONAD WILL GROW TO MATURITY IN AN HOUR PERSONALLY I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO LINGER IN MISSUS O'REILLY'S PLEASANT DRAWING ROOM FOR AS I SAID BEFORE MY VICTIM INTERESTED ME
2269-88761-0004 AND I WANTED TO OBSERVE HIM MORE CLOSELY AND HEAR WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT BUT I RECEIVED ORDERS TO ATTEND EVENSONG AT THE PARISH CHURCH AND TO HAUNT THE MIND OF LENA HOUGHTON AS WE PASSED DOWN THE HIGH STREET
2269-88761-0005 BUT THE STRANGE STILLNESS AND QUIET OPPRESSED ME I DID NOT FEEL NEARLY SO MUCH AT HOME AS IN MISSUS O'REILLY'S DRAWING ROOM TO USE A TERRESTRIAL SIMILE I FELT LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
2269-88761-0006 AND THE MOMENT HE OPENED HIS MOUTH I KNEW THAT MY TIME HAD COME AND THAT THERE WAS A VERY FAIR CHANCE OF VICTORY BEFORE ME
2269-88761-0007 I CANNOT SAY BUT HIS READING WAS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE WIND IN AN EQUINOCTIAL GALE
2269-88761-0008 I HAVE SINCE OBSERVED THAT HE WAS ONLY A DEGREE WORSE THAN MANY OTHER CLERICAL READERS AND THAT A STRANGE AND DELIGHTFULLY MISTAKEN NOTION SEEMS PREVALENT THAT THE BIBLE MUST BE READ IN A DREARY AND UNNATURAL TONE OF VOICE
2269-88761-0009 OR WITH A SORT OF MOURNFUL MONOTONY IT IS INTENDED AS A SORT OF REVERENCE BUT I SUSPECT THAT IT OFTEN PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF MY PROGENITOR AS IT MOST ASSUREDLY DID IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE
2269-88761-0010 HARDLY HAD THE RECTOR ANNOUNCED HERE BEGINNETH THE FORTY FOURTH VERSE OF THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER OF THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET EZEKIEL THAN A SORT OF RELAXATION TOOK PLACE IN THE MIND I WAS ATTACKING
2269-88761-0011 LENA HOUGHTON'S ATTENTION COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE DREARILY READ LESSON BY A VERY GREAT EFFORT SHE WAS A LITTLE LAZY AND DID NOT MAKE THE EFFORT SHE THOUGHT HOW NICE IT WAS TO SIT DOWN AGAIN
2269-88761-0012 AND THEN THE MELANCHOLY VOICE LULLED HER INTO A VAGUE INTERVAL OF THOUGHTLESS INACTIVITY I PROMPTLY SEIZED MY OPPORTUNITY AND IN A MOMENT HER WHOLE MIND WAS FULL OF ME
2269-88761-0013 SHE WAS AN EXCITABLE IMPRESSIONABLE SORT OF GIRL AND WHEN ONCE I HAD OBTAINED AN ENTRANCE INTO HER MIND I FOUND IT THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO DOMINATE HER THOUGHTS
2269-88761-0014 THOUGH SHE STOOD AND SAT AND KNELT AND CURTSEYED AND ARTICULATED WORDS HER THOUGHTS WERE ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN ME I CROWDED OUT THE MAGNIFICAT WITH A PICTURE OF ZALUSKI AND GERTRUDE MORLEY
2269-88761-0015 I LED HER THROUGH MORE TERRIBLE FUTURE POSSIBILITIES IN THE SECOND LESSON THAN WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR A THREE VOLUME NOVEL I ENTIRELY ECLIPSED THE COLLECTS WITH REFLECTIONS ON UNHAPPY MARRIAGES
2269-88761-0016 TOOK HER OFF VIA RUSSIA AND NIHILISM IN THE STATE PRAYERS AND BY THE TIME WE ARRIVED AT SAINT CHRYSOSTOM HAD BECOME SO POWERFUL THAT I HAD WORKED HER MIND INTO EXACTLY THE CONDITION I DESIRED
2269-88761-0017 THE CONGREGATION ROSE LENA HOUGHTON STILL DOMINATED BY ME KNELT LONGER THAN THE REST BUT AT LAST SHE GOT UP AND WALKED DOWN THE AISLE AND I FELT A GREAT SENSE OF RELIEF AND SATISFACTION
2269-88761-0018 WE WERE OUT IN THE OPEN AIR ONCE MORE AND I HAD TRIUMPHED I WAS QUITE SURE THAT SHE WOULD TELL THE FIRST PERSON SHE MET FOR AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE SHE WAS ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH ME
2269-88761-0019 AND TO HAVE KEPT ME TO HERSELF WOULD HAVE REQUIRED FAR MORE STRENGTH AND UNSELFISHNESS THAN SHE AT THAT MOMENT POSSESSED
2269-88761-0020 SHE WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD FEELING MUCH PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE CURATE HAD JUST LEFT THE VESTRY DOOR AND THAT IN A FEW MOMENTS THEIR PATHS MUST CONVERGE
2269-88761-0021 MISTER BLACKTHORNE HAD ONLY BEEN ORDAINED THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND WAS A LITTLE YOUNGER AND MUCH LESS EXPERIENCED IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD THAN SIGISMUND ZALUSKI HE WAS A GOOD WELL MEANING FELLOW
2269-88761-0022 A LITTLE NARROW A LITTLE PREJUDICED A LITTLE SPOILED BY THE DEVOTION OF THE DISTRICT VISITORS AND SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHERS BUT HE WAS HONEST AND ENERGETIC AND AS A WORKER AMONG THE POOR FEW COULD HAVE EQUALLED HIM
2269-88761-0023 HE SEEMED TO FANCY HOWEVER THAT WITH THE POOR HIS WORK ENDED AND HE WAS NOT ALWAYS SO WISE AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN MUDDLETON SOCIETY GOOD AFTERNOON MISS HOUGHTON HE EXCLAIMED
2269-88761-0024 DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW IF YOUR BROTHER IS AT HOME I WANT JUST TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT THE CHOIR TREAT
2269-88761-0025 SAID LENA AND THEY WALKED HOME TOGETHER I AM SO GLAD TO HAVE THIS CHANCE OF SPEAKING TO YOU SHE BEGAN RATHER NERVOUSLY I WANTED PARTICULARLY TO ASK YOUR ADVICE
2269-88761-0026 MISTER BLACKTHORNE BEING HUMAN AND YOUNG WAS NOT UNNATURALLY FLATTERED BY THIS REMARK TRUE HE WAS BECOMING WELL ACCUSTOMED TO THIS SORT OF THING
2269-88761-0027 SINCE THE LADIES OF MUDDLETON WERE FAR MORE FOND OF SEEKING ADVICE FROM THE YOUNG AND GOOD LOOKING CURATE THAN FROM THE ELDERLY AND EXPERIENCED RECTOR THEY SAID IT WAS BECAUSE MISTER BLACKTHORNE WAS SO MUCH MORE SYMPATHETIC
2269-88761-0028 AND UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DAY SO MUCH BETTER BUT I THINK THEY UNCONSCIOUSLY DECEIVED THEMSELVES FOR THE RECTOR WAS ONE OF A THOUSAND AND THE CURATE THOUGH HE HAD IN HIM THE MAKINGS OF A FINE MAN
2269-88761-0029 WAS AS YET ALTOGETHER CRUDE AND YOUNG WAS IT ABOUT ANYTHING IN YOUR DISTRICT
2269-88761-0030 YOU WON'T TELL ANY ONE THAT I TOLD YOU ON NO ACCOUNT SAID THE CURATE WARMLY WELL YOU KNOW MISTER ZALUSKI AND HOW THE MORLEYS HAVE TAKEN HIM UP EVERY ONE HAS TAKEN HIM UP
2269-88761-0031 SAID THE CURATE WITH THE LEAST LITTLE TOUCH OF RESENTMENT IN HIS TONE I KNEW THAT THE MORLEYS WERE HIS SPECIAL FRIENDS I IMAGINE THAT HE ADMIRES MISS MORLEY YES EVERY ONE THINKS THEY ARE EITHER ENGAGED OR ON THE BRINK OF IT
2269-88761-0032 FOR IT SEEMS SUCH A DREADFUL FATE FOR POOR GERTRUDE THE CURATE LOOKED STARTLED WHY I DON'T PROFESS TO LIKE MISTER ZALUSKI HE SAID BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING EXACTLY AGAINST HIM BUT I DO
2269-88761-0033 MISSUS O'REILLY HAS JUST BEEN TELLING ME WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU HE ASKED WITH SOME CURIOSITY WHY SHE HAS FOUND OUT THAT HE IS REALLY A NIHILIST
2269-88761-0034 JUST THINK OF A NIHILIST GOING ABOUT LOOSE LIKE THIS AND PLAYING TENNIS AT THE RECTORY AND ALL THE GOOD HOUSES AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT SHE SAYS HE IS ALTOGETHER A DANGEROUS UNPRINCIPLED MAN WITH A DREADFUL TEMPER
2269-88761-0035 YOU CAN'T THINK HOW UNHAPPY SHE IS ABOUT POOR GERTRUDE AND SO AM I
2269-88761-0036 YES THAT IS THE WORST OF IT SHE REPLIED WITH A SIGH I SUPPOSE WE CAN DO NOTHING STILL IT HAS BEEN A GREAT RELIEF JUST TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT AND GET IT OFF MY MIND
2269-88761-0037 I SUPPOSE WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT SOMETHING MAY PUT A STOP TO IT ALL WE MUST JUST LEAVE IT TO CHANCE THIS SENTIMENT AMUSED ME NOT A LITTLE LEAVE IT TO CHANCE INDEED
2269-88761-0038 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOMINATE HIS THOUGHTS AS I HAD DONE HERS FINDING ME BURDENSOME SHE HAD PASSED ME ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE WITH ADDITIONS THAT VASTLY INCREASED MY WORKING POWERS
2269-88761-0039 AND THEN SHE TALKED OF LEAVING IT TO CHANCE
2269-88761-0040 AND YET LENA HOUGHTON WAS A GOOD SORT OF GIRL AND HAD FROM HER CHILDHOOD REPEATED THE CATECHISM WORDS WHICH PROCLAIM THAT MY DUTY TO MY NEIGHBOUR IS TO LOVE HIM AS MYSELF
2269-88761-0041 TO KEEP MY TONGUE FROM EVIL SPEAKING LYING AND SLANDERING WHAT IS MORE SHE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO TEACH THESE WORDS TO A BIG CLASS OF SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN
2269-88761-0042 AND WENT RAIN OR SHINE TO SPEND TWO HOURS EACH SUNDAY IN A STUFFY SCHOOL ROOM FOR THAT PURPOSE IT WAS STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD BE SO READY TO BELIEVE EVIL OF HER NEIGHBOUR
2269-88761-0043 AND SO EAGER TO SPREAD THE STORY BUT MY PROGENITOR IS CLEVER AND DOUBTLESS KNOWS VERY WELL WHOM TO SELECT AS HIS TOOLS
