8443-274756-0000 THE COQUETTE'S BLANDISHMENTS HAVE YOU FINISHED THINKING YET DORIS ASKED EARLE GENTLY NO SHE REPLIED I AM GETTING A LITTLE CLEARER IN MY IDEAS BUT I HAVE BY NO MEANS FINISHED YET
8443-274756-0001 SHE HAD TWO PLANS BEFORE HER ONE WAS TO WAIT FOR LORD CHARLES AND TELL HIM ALL TO TRUST TO HIS GENEROSITY TO KEEP THEIR SECRET THEN SHE LAUGHED BITTERLY AS SHE REPEATED THE WORD GENEROSITY HE HAD NONE
8443-274756-0002 HE WAS RECKLESS EXTRAVAGANT OVER MONEY BUT AS FOR GENEROSITY HONOR OR PRINCIPLE SHE KNEW HE HAD NONE IN TRUSTING TO THAT SHE WOULD INDEED TRUST TO A BROKEN REED BESIDES
8443-274756-0003 IF SHE WERE ONCE ESTABLISHED IN THIS NEW SPHERE OF LIFE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY DISAGREEABLE AND OFFENSIVE TO HAVE ANY ONE NEAR HER WHO KNEW OF THIS EPISODE
8443-274756-0004 HE WOULD HOLD THE SECRET LIKE A DRAWN SWORD OVER HER HEAD NO BETTER FOR HER OWN SAFETY TO STEAL AWAY FROM HIM WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD EVEN IF IN THE AFTER YEARS
8443-274756-0005 THEY SHOULD MEET AGAIN IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE HER SURROUNDED BY ALL THE LUXURIES OF HER POSITION THE HONORED DAUGHTER OF NOBLE PARENTS IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE IN HER
8443-274756-0006 THE GIRL WHO HAD LEFT BRACKENSIDE FOR HIS SAKE AS FOR LEAVING HIM FAR FROM FEELING THE LEAST REGRET FAR FROM SEEING THAT SHE WAS TREATING HIM DISHONORABLY SHE SMILED TO HERSELF AT HIS CONSTERNATION WHEN HE SHOULD RETURN
8443-274756-0007 TO THE RIVER SIDE AND NOT FIND HER HE WILL THINK THAT I HAVE RUN AWAY WITH SOME ONE ELSE SHE THOUGHT AND THE IDEA AMUSED HER SO INTENSELY THAT SHE LAUGHED ALOUD YOU ARE WELL CONTENT SAID EARLE BITTERLY
8443-274756-0008 YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME WEALTH AND FORTUNE TITLE AND HONOR
8443-274756-0009 AND IT HAD BROUGHT HER TO TWO CONCLUSIONS SHE MUST LEAVE LORD VIVIANNE AT ONCE AND IN SILENCE WHILE SHE MUST AT THE SAME TIME AT ANY PRICE KEEP HER SECRET FROM EARLE
8443-274756-0010 ANOTHER AND VERY PROBABLE IDEA OCCURRED TO HER IT WAS THIS BY EARLE BEING SENT TO FETCH HER IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT HER PARENTS APPROVED OF HIM AND THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO MARRY HIM LOOKING AT HIM
8443-274756-0011 SHE THOUGHT IT WAS NOT SUCH A BAD ALTERNATIVE AFTER ALL HE WAS HANDSOMER YOUNGER STRONGER THAN LORD VIVIANNE BESIDES WHAT LITTLE AFFECTION SHE HAD HAD TO GIVE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIS THEN SHE AROSE FROM HER SEAT WITH A SMILE
8443-274756-0012 I HAVE FINISHED THINKING EARLE TO MAKE MATTERS SQUARE I PROMISE MYSELF THAT I WILL NOT THINK AGAIN FOR EVER SO MANY MONTHS WHAT IS THE RESULT OF YOUR DELIBERATION HE SAID I WISH YOU WOULD BE A LITTLE KINDER TO ME EARLE
8443-274756-0013 YOU SPEAK SO GRAVELY YOU LOOK SO COLDLY THAT YOU MAKE ME QUITE UNHAPPY HIS FACE FLUSHED SLIGHTLY AND HIS LIPS TREMBLED I DO NOT WISH TO SEEM UNKIND DORIS BUT LET ME ASK YOU
8443-274756-0014 WHAT ELSE BESIDES COLDNESS AND GRAVITY CAN YOU EXPECT FROM ME YOU KNOW I ALWAYS LIKED YOU EARLE I KNOW YOU BETRAYED AND DECEIVED ME ABOUT AS BASELY AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO DECEIVE ANY ONE
8443-274756-0015 BUT WE NEED NOT DISCUSS THAT NOW SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A SMILE FEW MEN COULD RESIST AND HELD OUT HER HANDS BE FRIENDS EARLE I LIKE YOU TOO WELL AFTER ALL TO TRAVEL WITH YOU WHILE YOU LOOK SO COLD AND STERN
8443-274756-0016 GIVE ME ONE SMILE ONLY ONE THEN I SHALL FEEL MORE AT MY EASE I DO NOT THINK MY SMILES CHEER OR THE LOSS OF THEM DEPRESSES YOU NEITHER CAN I SMILE TO ORDER STILL YOU NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF TRAVELING WITH ME
8443-274756-0017 IT WAS IN HER NATURE TO RESPECT HIM MORE THE MORE DIFFICULT HE SEEMED TO PLEASE I SHALL MANAGE HIM IN TIME SHE THOUGHT I SHALL RETURN WITH YOU EARLE SHE SAID I HAVE BEEN THINKING IT ALL OVER AND I WILL GO AT ONCE
8443-274756-0018 I WILL NOT WAIT TO SAY GOOD BYE TO THE PEOPLE HERE BUT THAT SEEMS STRANGE NOT QUITE RIGHT WHY NOT GO AND BID THEM FAREWELL TELL THEM THE GOOD FORTUNE THAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU NO
8443-274756-0019 THEY WOULD NOT LET ME COME AWAY BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT PERSISTED EARLE IT IS RIGHT ENOUGH IF I GO BACK TO THEM I SHALL NOT GO WITH YOU I CAN WRITE TO THEM AS SOON AS I REACH ENGLAND AND TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT
8443-274756-0020 I KNOW YOU WILL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY DORIS IT IS USELESS FOR ME TO INTERFERE DO AS YOU PLEASE THAT IS LIKE MY OLD LOVER EARLE NOW I BEGIN TO FEEL AT HOME WITH YOU I DID USE YOU VERY WICKEDLY
8443-274756-0021 BUT ALL THE TIME I LIKED YOU I KNOW EXACTLY THE VALUE OF YOUR LIKING SAID EARLE WHO HAD DETERMINED TO BE COOL AND GUARDED SHE TALKED TO HIM IN THE OLD SWEET TONES
8443-274756-0022 SHE GAVE HIM THE SWEETEST GLANCES FROM HER LOVELY EYES SHE REMEMBERED ALL THE PRETTY ARTS AND GRACES WHICH HAD ATTRACTED HIM MOST AND EARLE DESPITE HIS CAUTION DESPITE HIS RESOLVE
8443-274756-0023 KNEW THAT HIS HEART WAS ON FIRE AGAIN WITH THE GLAMOUR AND MAGIC OF HER BEAUTY KNEW THAT EVERY PULSE WAS THROBBING WITH PASSION AND SHE KNEW AS WELL AS THOUGH HE HAD PUT IT INTO WORDS
8443-274756-0024 THAT THE OLD CHARM WAS RETURNING ONLY A THOUSAND TIMES STRONGER SHE LAID HER WHITE HAND ON HIS ARM AND HE SHRANK SHUDDERING FROM THE TOUCH SHE ONLY SMILED HER TIME WOULD COME
8443-274756-0025 THE REASON IS THAT I WISH THEM TO FORGET ME I SHALL NOT LIKE WHEN I AM LADY DORIS STUDLEIGH TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THEM THAT PRIDE WAS SO EXACTLY LIKE HER HE UNDERSTOOD IT WELL
8443-274756-0026 YOU CAN RETURN TO FLORENCE IF YOU LIKE SHE CONTINUED WITH THE AIR OF A QUEEN BUT IF YOU WISH TO PLEASE ME YOU WILL WALK ON WITH ME TO THE NEAREST RAILWAY STATION AND LET US GO AT ONCE TO GENOA WE CAN TRAVEL FROM GENOA TO LONDON
8443-274756-0027 BUT I HAVE LEFT MY THINGS AT THE HOTEL HE SAID IS THERE ANYTHING PARTICULAR AMONG THEM EARLE NO HE REPLIED THEN YOU CAN SEND FOR THEM ON YOUR ARRIVAL PLEASE YOURSELF IF YOU DO NOT GO ON MY TERMS I SHALL GO ALONE
8443-274756-0028 THEN HE LOOKED AT THE RIPPLING GOLDEN HAIR THAT FELL IN SUCH SHINING PROFUSION OVER HER SHOULDERS AT THE DRESS OF RICH VELVET SILK AND DELICATE LACE YOU ARE NOT DRESSED FOR TRAVELING WHY BE SO HASTY HE SAID
8443-274756-0029 SHE REPLIED THEN HE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT COSTLY JEWELS SHE WORE AND HOW HER HANDS WERE COVERED WITH SHINING GEMS FOR THE FIRST TIME A THRILL OF UNEASINESS OF DOUBT OF FEAR SHOT THROUGH HIM
8443-274756-0030 YOU HAVE SOME BEAUTIFUL JEWELS DORIS HE SAID SLOWLY HER FACE FLUSHED THEN SHE LAUGHED CARELESSLY HOW EASY IT IS TO DECEIVE A MAN SHE SAID A LADY WOULD HAVE KNOWN AT ONE GLANCE THAT THEY WERE NOT REAL
8443-274756-0031 HE FELT GREATLY RELIEVED THEY ARE PRETTY BUT NOT VERY VALUABLE SHE CONTINUED GIVEN TO ME BY THE CHILDREN
8443-274756-0032 IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THEM EARLE I WILL THROW THEM INTO THE ARNO ONE BY ONE WHY DO THAT IF THE LITTLE CHILDREN GAVE THEM TO YOU I AM NO JUDGE OF PRECIOUS STONES BUT LOOKING AT THE LIGHT IN THOSE I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEM REAL
8443-274756-0033 DO YOU KNOW THAT IF THEY WERE REAL THEY WOULD BE WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF POUNDS YOU MUST THINK AN ENGLISH GOVERNESS IN ITALY COINS MONEY HE LOOKED ADMIRINGLY AT HER HANDSOME DRESS ALTHOUGH TOO INEXPERIENCED
8443-274756-0034 TO KNOW ITS REAL VALUE THIS IS MY BEST DRESS TOO SHE SAID AND DO YOU KNOW EARLE THAT AS I PUT IT ON I SAID TO MYSELF I DO NOT LOOK AMISS IN THIS I WISH EARLE COULD SEE ME DID YOU REALLY
8443-274756-0035 HE ASKED A FLUSH OF DELIGHT RISING TO HIS BROW
8443-274756-0036 DID YOU DORIS THEN
8443-274756-0037 OH EARLE WHAT A QUESTION LIKE YOU DID YOU NOT FEEL SURE THAT WHEN I HAD SEEN SOMETHING OF THE WORLD HAD ALLAYED THE FEVER OF EXCITEMENT THAT I SHOULD RETURN TO YOU DID YOU NOT FEEL SURE OF IT
8443-274756-0038 NO SUCH THOUGHT OR INTENTION HAD EVER BEEN IN HER MIND STILL SHE WISHED TO MAKE THE BEST OF MATTERS IT WAS NO USE FOR HER TO RETURN TO ENGLAND
8443-274756-0039 A FEW UNTRUTHS MORE OR LESS DID NOT TROUBLE HER IN THE LEAST ONLY PROVIDED THAT HE BELIEVED THEM I NEVER THOUGHT SO WAS HIS SIMPLY REPLY I BELIEVED YOU HAD LEFT ME FOREVER DORIS
8443-274756-0040 YOU MUST NEVER JUDGE ME BY THE SAME RULE YOU WOULD APPLY TO OTHERS EARLE
8443-274756-0041 I BELIEVE IT HE REPLIED YET ALTHOUGH HE SAW THAT SHE WISHED TO MAKE FRIENDS AND WAS FLATTERED BY THE BELIEF
8443-274756-0042 THEN SHE TOOK OUT A LITTLE JEWELED WATCH THAT SHE WORE TIME WAS FLYING IN ONE SHORT HALF HOUR LORD CHARLES WOULD BE BACK WITH HER FLOWERS AND NEWS OF THE OPERA BOX HOW ANGRY HE WILL BE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
8443-274756-0043 TO THINK THAT ANY ONE SHOULD THWART HIS SOVEREIGN WILL AND PLEASURE HE WILL LOOK IN EVERY PRETTY NOOK BY THE RIVER BANK THEN HE WILL GO INTO THE HOUSE AND ASK HAVE YOU SEEN MISSUS CONYERS AND NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER HIM
8443-274756-0044 I SHOULD LIKE TO BE HERE TO SEE THE SENSATION THEN HE WILL BE SULKY AND FINALLY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I HAVE GIVEN HIM UP AND HAVE RUN AWAY FROM HIM SHE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF HIM AS SELFISH LOVING NOTHING BUT HIMSELF
8443-274756-0045 WITH A MADNESS OF PASSION TO WHICH HE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERYTHING ON EARTH SHE HAD BEEN SO ENTIRELY WRAPPED UP IN HER OWN PURSUITS IN THE ACQUISITION OF NUMBERLESS DRESSES AND JEWELS
8443-274756-0046 THAT SHE HAD NOT OBSERVED THE SIGNS OF HIS INCREASING DEVOTION BLIND TO HIS MAD PASSION FOR HER SHE DECIDED UPON LEAVING HIM AND OF ALL THE MISTAKES THAT SHE EVER MADE IN HER LIFE NONE WAS SO GREAT AS THIS
8443-274756-0047 TEN MINUTES LATER THEY WERE WALKING RAPIDLY TOWARD THE LITTLE TOWN OF SEIPIA THERE THEY COULD GO BY TRAIN TO GENOA AS THEY WALKED ALONG THE HIGH ROAD DORIS LAUGHED AND TALKED GAYLY
8443-274756-0048 THIS REMINDS ME OF OLD TIMES EARLE SHE SAID HOW GOES THE POETRY DEAR I EXPECT TO HEAR THAT YOU HAVE PERFORMED MIRACLES BY THIS TIME YOU DESTROYED MY POETRY DORIS WHEN YOU MARRED MY GENIUS AND BLIGHTED MY LIFE
8443-274756-0049 SHE LAID HER HAND CARESSINGLY ON HIS DID I THEN I MUST MAKE AMENDS FOR IT NOW SHE SAID AND HE WAS ALMOST VEXED TO FIND HOW THE WORDS THRILLED HIM WITH A KEEN PASSIONATE DELIGHT
8443-274756-0050 SUDDENLY SHE RAISED A LAUGHING FACE TO HIS WAS THERE A VERY DREADFUL SENSATION EARLE WHEN THEY FOUND OUT I WAS GONE THE SMILING FACE THE LAUGHING VOICE SMOTE HIM LIKE A SHARP SWORD
8443-274756-0051 HE REMEMBERED THE PAIN AND THE ANGUISH THE TORTURE HE HAD SUFFERED THE LONG HOURS WHEN HE HAD LAIN BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH HE REMEMBERED THE FAME HE HAD LOST THE SWEET GIFT OF GENIUS ALL DESTROYED HIS HEART BROKEN
8443-274756-0052 HIS LIFE RENDERED STALE AND PROFITLESS WHILE SHE COULD SMILE AND ASK WITH LAUGHING EYES IF THERE HAD BEEN MUCH SENSATION I BELIEVE HE CRIED WITH A SUDDEN FLAME OF PASSION WOMEN ARE NERVED WITH HEARTLESSNESS
