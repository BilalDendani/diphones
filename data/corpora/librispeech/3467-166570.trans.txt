3467-166570-0000 THAT THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULT THING TO DO DORIS WAS SOON TO REALISE MISTER CHALLONER CONTINUED TO PASS THE HOUSE TWICE A DAY AND THE TIME FINALLY CAME WHEN HE VENTURED UP THE WALK
3467-166570-0001 SHE SLIPPED SOFTLY OUT AND INTERCEPTED HIM BEFORE HE HAD STEPPED UPON THE PORCH SHE HAD CAUGHT UP HER HAT AS SHE PASSED THROUGH THE HALL AND WAS FITTING IT TO HER HEAD AS HE LOOKED UP AND SAW HER MISS SCOTT HE ASKED
3467-166570-0002 YES MISTER CHALLONER YOU KNOW ME HE WENT ON ONE FOOT ON THE STEP AND ONE STILL ON THE WALK BEFORE REPLYING SHE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER THEN AS SHE NOTED HIS SURPRISE
3467-166570-0003 SHE CAREFULLY EXPLAINED MISTER BROTHERSON OUR BOARDER IS JUST RECOVERING FROM TYPHOID HE IS STILL WEAK AND ACUTELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE LEAST NOISE I WAS AFRAID THAT OUR VOICES MIGHT DISTURB HIM
3467-166570-0004 DO YOU MIND WALKING A LITTLE WAY UP THE ROAD THAT IS IF YOUR VISIT WAS INTENDED FOR ME HER FLUSH THE BEAUTY WHICH MUST HAVE STRUCK EVEN HIM BUT MORE THAN ALL ELSE HER YOUTH
3467-166570-0005 SEEMED TO RECONCILE HIM TO THIS UNCONVENTIONAL REQUEST BOWING HE TOOK HIS FOOT FROM THE STEP SAYING AS SHE JOINED HIM YES YOU ARE THE ONE I WANTED TO SEE THAT IS TO DAY
3467-166570-0006 LATER I HOPE TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER BROTHERSON SHE GAVE HIM ONE QUICK LOOK TREMBLING SO THAT HE OFFERED HER HIS ARM WITH A FATHERLY AIR
3467-166570-0007 I SEE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND MY ERRAND HERE HE PROCEEDED WITH A GRAVE SMILE MEANT AS SHE KNEW FOR HER ENCOURAGEMENT I AM GLAD BECAUSE WE CAN GO AT ONCE TO THE POINT
3467-166570-0008 MISS SCOTT HE CONTINUED IN A VOICE FROM WHICH HE NO LONGER STROVE TO KEEP BACK THE EVIDENCES OF DEEP FEELING I HAVE THE STRONGEST INTEREST IN YOUR PATIENT THAT ONE MAN CAN HAVE IN ANOTHER WHERE THERE IS NO PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCESHIP
3467-166570-0009 YOU WHO HAVE EVERY REASON TO UNDERSTAND MY REASONS FOR THIS WILL ACCEPT THE STATEMENT I HOPE AS FRANKLY AS IT IS MADE SHE NODDED HER EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS BUT SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO RAISE THEM
3467-166570-0010 SHE HAD THE GREATEST DESIRE TO SEE THE FACE OF THE MAN WHO COULD SPEAK LIKE THIS TO DAY AND YET OF WHOSE PRIDE AND SENSE OF SUPERIORITY HIS DAUGHTER HAD STOOD IN SUCH AWE THAT SHE HAD LAID A SEAL UPON THE IMPULSES OF HER HEART
3467-166570-0011 AND IMPOSED SUCH TASKS AND WEARY WAITING UPON HER LOVER DORIS FORGOT IN MEETING HIS SOFTENED GLANCE AND TENDER ALMOST WISTFUL EXPRESSION THE CHANGES WHICH CAN BE MADE BY A GREAT GRIEF
3467-166570-0012 AND THUS POSSIBLY AVERTED THE DOOM WHICH DORIS FELT HAD IN SOME WAY GROWN OUT OF THIS SECRECY WHY SHOULD SHE HAVE FEARED THE DISAPPROVAL OF THIS MAN SHE INWARDLY QUERIED
3467-166570-0013 AS SHE CAST HIM A CONFIDING LOOK WHICH PLEASED HIM GREATLY AS HIS TONE NOW SHOWED WHEN I LOST MY DAUGHTER I LOST EVERYTHING HE DECLARED AS THEY WALKED SLOWLY UP THE ROAD
3467-166570-0014 NOTHING EXCITES MY INTEREST SAVE THAT WHICH ONCE EXCITED HERS I AM TOLD THAT THE DEEPEST INTEREST OF HER LIFE LAY HERE I AM ALSO TOLD THAT IT WAS AN INTEREST QUITE WORTHY OF HER
3467-166570-0015 I EXPECT TO FIND IT SO I HOPE WITH ALL MY HEART TO FIND IT SO
3467-166570-0016 I HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE AGREEABLE TO HIM I HOPE THAT I AM NOT PRESUMING TOO MUCH IN CHERISHING THESE EXPECTATIONS DORIS TURNED HER CANDID EYES UPON HIM I CANNOT TELL I DO NOT KNOW
3467-166570-0017 SAID SHE NOBODY KNOWS NOT EVEN THE DOCTOR WHAT EFFECT THE NEWS WE SO DREAD TO GIVE HIM WILL HAVE UPON MISTER BROTHERSON YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT
3467-166570-0018 IT CANNOT BE KEPT FROM HIM MUCH LONGER WHEN I RETURN I SHALL SHRINK FROM HIS FIRST LOOK IN THE FEAR OF SEEING IT BETRAY THIS DREADFUL KNOWLEDGE YET I HAVE A FAITHFUL WOMAN THERE TO KEEP EVERY ONE OUT OF HIS ROOM
3467-166570-0019 YOU HAVE HAD MUCH TO CARRY FOR ONE SO YOUNG WAS MISTER CHALLONER'S SYMPATHETIC REMARK YOU MUST LET ME HELP YOU WHEN THAT AWFUL MOMENT COMES I AM AT THE HOTEL AND SHALL STAY THERE TILL MISTER BROTHERSON IS PRONOUNCED QUITE WELL
3467-166570-0020 I HAVE NO OTHER DUTY NOW IN LIFE BUT TO SUSTAIN HIM THROUGH HIS TROUBLE AND THEN WITH WHAT AID HE CAN GIVE SEARCH OUT AND FIND THE CAUSE OF MY DAUGHTER'S DEATH WHICH I WILL NEVER ADMIT WITHOUT THE FULLEST PROOF
3467-166570-0021 TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF SUICIDE DORIS TREMBLED IT WAS NOT SUICIDE SHE DECLARED VEHEMENTLY I HAVE ALWAYS FELT SURE THAT IT WAS NOT BUT TO DAY I KNOW
3467-166570-0022 HER HAND FELL CLENCHED ON HER BREAST AND HER EYES GLEAMED STRANGELY MISTER CHALLONER WAS HIMSELF GREATLY STARTLED WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED SINCE YESTERDAY THAT SHE SHOULD EMPHASISE THAT NOW
3467-166570-0023 I'VE NOT TOLD ANY ONE SHE WENT ON AS HE STOPPED SHORT IN THE ROAD IN HIS ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND HER BUT I WILL TELL YOU
3467-166570-0024 ONLY NOT HERE NOT WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE DRIVING PAST MOST OF WHOM KNOW ME COME TO THE HOUSE LATER
3467-166570-0025 WOULD YOU OBJECT TO DOING THAT AM I ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOU NO NOT AT ALL
3467-166570-0026 WILL THAT BE TOO EARLY NO NO OH HOW THOSE PEOPLE STARED LET US HASTEN BACK OR THEY MAY CONNECT YOUR NAME WITH WHAT WE WANT KEPT SECRET HE SMILED AT HER FEARS BUT GAVE IN TO HER HUMOUR
3467-166570-0027 HE WOULD SEE HER SOON AGAIN AND POSSIBLY LEARN SOMETHING WHICH WOULD AMPLY REPAY HIM BOTH FOR HIS TROUBLE AND HIS PATIENCE BUT WHEN EVENING CAME AND SHE TURNED TO FACE HIM IN THAT LITTLE SITTING ROOM WHERE HE HAD QUIETLY FOLLOWED HER
3467-166570-0028 SHE HAD BEEN THINKING IN THE HOURS WHICH HAD PASSED AND HAD LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF THAT ONE IMPETUOUS MOMENT HER GREETING BETRAYED EMBARRASSMENT AND SHE HESITATED PAINFULLY BEFORE SHE SPOKE
3467-166570-0029 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WILL THINK OF ME SHE VENTURED AT LAST MOTIONING TO A CHAIR BUT NOT SITTING HERSELF YOU HAVE HAD TIME TO THINK OVER WHAT I SAID AND PROBABLY EXPECT SOMETHING REAL
3467-166570-0030 SOMETHING YOU COULD TELL PEOPLE BUT IT ISN'T LIKE THAT IT'S A FEELING A BELIEF I'M SO SURE SURE OF WHAT MISS SCOTT SHE GAVE A GLANCE AT THE DOOR BEFORE STEPPING UP NEARER
3467-166570-0031 A DREAM MISS SCOTT HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT YES I KNEW THAT IT WOULD SOUND FOOLISH TO YOU IT SOUNDS FOOLISH TO ME BUT LISTEN SIR
3467-166570-0032 LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO TELL AND THEN YOU CAN JUDGE I WAS VERY MUCH AGITATED YESTERDAY I HAD TO WRITE A LETTER AT MISTER BROTHERSON'S DICTATION A LETTER TO HER YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MY HORROR
3467-166570-0033 AND THE EFFORT I MADE TO HIDE MY EMOTION I WAS QUITE UNNERVED I COULD NOT SLEEP TILL MORNING
3467-166570-0034 I SAW I HOPE I CAN DESCRIBE IT GRASPING AT A NEAR BY CHAIR SHE LEANED ON IT FOR SUPPORT CLOSING HER EYES TO ALL BUT THAT INNER VISION A BREATHLESS MOMENT FOLLOWED
3467-166570-0035 THEN SHE MURMURED IN STRAINED MONOTONOUS TONES I SEE IT AGAIN JUST AS I SAW IT IN THE EARLY MORNING BUT EVEN MORE PLAINLY IF THAT IS POSSIBLE A HALL I SHOULD CALL IT A HALL THOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING ANY PLACE LIKE IT BEFORE
3467-166570-0036 DRAWING OUT SOMETHING WHICH I CANNOT DESCRIBE BUT WHICH HE HANDLES AS IF IT WERE A PISTOL I FEEL A HORRIBLE FEAR AND
3467-166570-0037 THE CHILD WAS STAGGERING AND THE HAND WHICH WAS FREE HAD SOUGHT HER HEART WHERE IT LAY CLENCHED THE KNUCKLES SHOWING WHITE IN THE DIM LIGHT MISTER CHALLONER WATCHED HER WITH DILATED EYES
3467-166570-0038 THE SPELL UNDER WHICH SHE SPOKE FALLING IN SOME DEGREE UPON HIM HAD SHE FINISHED WAS THIS ALL
3467-166570-0039 BUT VERY LOW ALMOST IN A WHISPER THERE IS MUSIC A CRASH BUT I PLAINLY SEE HIS OTHER HAND APPROACH THE OBJECT HE IS HOLDING HE TAKES SOMETHING FROM THE END THE OBJECT IS POINTED MY WAY
3467-166570-0040 I AM LOOKING INTO INTO WHAT I DO NOT KNOW
3467-166570-0041 YET IT WAS NOT I WHO HAD BEEN SHOT SHE ADDED SOFTLY MISTER CHALLONER SHUDDERED THIS WAS LIKE THE REOPENING OF HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE
3467-166570-0042 BUT HE HAD ENTERED UPON THE SCENE WITH A FULL APPRECIATION OF THE ORDEAL AWAITING HIM AND HE DID NOT LOSE HIS CALMNESS OR THE CONTROL OF HIS JUDGMENT BE SEATED MISS SCOTT HE ENTREATED TAKING A CHAIR HIMSELF
3467-166570-0043 YOU HAVE DESCRIBED THE SPOT AND SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY DAUGHTER'S DEATH AS ACCURATELY AS IF YOU HAD BEEN THERE BUT YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS READ A FULL ACCOUNT OF THOSE DETAILS IN THE PAPERS
3467-166570-0044 POSSIBLY SEEN PICTURES WHICH WOULD MAKE THE PLACE QUITE REAL TO YOU THE MIND IS A STRANGE STOREHOUSE WE DO NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHAT LIES HIDDEN WITHIN IT THAT'S TRUE SHE ADMITTED BUT THE MAN
3467-166570-0045 I HAD NEVER SEEN THE MAN OR ANY PICTURE OF HIM AND HIS FACE WAS CLEAREST OF ALL I SHOULD KNOW IT IF I SAW IT ANYWHERE IT IS IMPRINTED ON MY MEMORY AS PLAINLY AS YOURS OH I HOPE NEVER TO SEE THAT MAN
3467-166570-0046 MISTER CHALLONER SIGHED HE HAD REALLY ANTICIPATED SOMETHING FROM THE INTERVIEW THE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS KEEN A MOMENT OF EXPECTATION THE THRILL WHICH COMES TO US ALL UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE SUPERNATURAL
3467-166570-0047 AND THEN THIS A YOUNG AND IMAGINATIVE GIRL'S DREAM CONVINCING TO HERSELF BUT SUPPLYING NOTHING WHICH HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN SUPPLIED BOTH BY THE FACTS AND HIS OWN IMAGINATION
3467-166570-0048 A MAN HAD STOOD AT THE STAIRCASE AND THIS MAN HAD RAISED HIS ARM SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD SEEN SOMETHING LIKE A PISTOL IN HIS HAND BUT HIS DAUGHTER HAD NOT BEEN SHOT THIS HE THOUGHT IT WELL TO POINT OUT TO HER
3467-166570-0049 LEANING TOWARD HER THAT HE MIGHT GET HER FULL ATTENTION HE WAITED TILL HER EYES MET HIS THEN QUIETLY ASKED HAVE YOU EVER NAMED THIS MAN TO YOURSELF
3467-166570-0050 SAID SHE WHY BECAUSE I'VE READ IN THE PAPERS THAT THE MAN WHO STOOD THERE HAD THE SAME NAME AS TELL ME MISS SCOTT AS MISTER BROTHERSON'S BROTHER
3467-166570-0051 I DO NOT KNOW YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HIS BROTHER NEVER NOR HIS PICTURE NO MISTER BROTHERSON HAS NONE AREN'T THEY FRIENDS
3467-166570-0052 DOES HE NEVER MENTION ORLANDO VERY VERY RARELY BUT I'VE NO REASON TO THINK THEY ARE NOT ON GOOD TERMS I KNOW THEY CORRESPOND MISS SCOTT YES MISTER CHALLONER
3467-166570-0053 YOU MUST NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON YOUR DREAM HER EYES FLASHED TO HIS AND THEN FELL AGAIN DREAMS ARE NOT REVELATIONS
3467-166570-0054 I CAN PROVE THAT YOUR DREAM IS SUCH HOW SHE LOOKED STARTLED YOU SPEAK OF SEEING SOMETHING BEING LEVELED AT YOU WHICH MADE YOU THINK OF A PISTOL YES I WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO IT
3467-166570-0055 BUT MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT SHOT SHE DIED FROM A STAB
3467-166570-0056 TOOK ON A STRANGE LOOK OF CONVICTION WHICH DEEPENED RATHER THAN MELTED UNDER HIS INDULGENT BUT PENETRATING GAZE I KNOW THAT YOU THINK SO BUT MY DREAM SAYS NO I SAW THIS OBJECT
3467-166570-0057 IT WAS POINTED DIRECTLY TOWARDS ME ABOVE ALL I SAW HIS FACE IT WAS THE FACE OF ONE WHOSE FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER AND WHO MEANS DEATH
3467-166570-0058 WELL IT WAS USELESS TO REASON FURTHER GENTLE IN ALL ELSE SHE WAS IMMOVABLE SO FAR AS THIS IDEA WAS CONCERNED AND SEEING THIS HE LET THE MATTER GO AND PREPARED TO TAKE HIS LEAVE
3467-166570-0059 SHE SEEMED TO BE QUITE READY FOR THIS ANXIETY ABOUT HER PATIENT HAD REGAINED ITS PLACE IN HER MIND AND HER GLANCE SPED CONSTANTLY TOWARD THE DOOR TAKING HER HAND IN HIS HE SAID SOME KIND WORDS
3467-166570-0060 THEN CROSSED TO THE DOOR AND OPENED IT INSTANTLY HER FINGER FLEW TO HER LIPS AND OBEDIENT TO ITS SILENT INJUNCTION HE TOOK UP HIS HAT IN SILENCE AND WAS PROCEEDING DOWN THE HALL WHEN THE BELL RANG
3467-166570-0061 STARTLING THEM BOTH AND CAUSING HIM TO STEP QUICKLY BACK WHO IS IT SHE ASKED FATHER'S IN AND VISITORS SELDOM COME SO LATE SHALL I SEE
3467-166570-0062 SHE NODDED LOOKING STRANGELY TROUBLED AS THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN REVEALING THE TALL STRONG FIGURE OF A MAN FACING THEM FROM THE PORCH A STRANGER FORMED ITSELF UPON HER LIPS
3467-166570-0063 AND SHE WAS MOVING FORWARD WHEN THE MAN SUDDENLY STEPPED INTO THE GLARE OF THE LIGHT AND SHE STOPPED WITH A MURMUR OF DISMAY WHICH PIERCED MISTER CHALLONER'S HEART AND PREPARED HIM FOR THE WORDS WHICH NOW FELL SHUDDERINGLY FROM HER LIPS IT IS HE
