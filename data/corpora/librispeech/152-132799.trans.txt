152-132799-0000 AS SOON AS THE NEWS THAT THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND WAS ON THE FRENCH COAST HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO VERSAILLES A PALACE WAS PREPARED FOR HER RECEPTION CARRIAGES AND TROOPS OF GUARDS WERE DESPATCHED TO AWAIT HER ORDERS
152-132799-0001 BUT WAS HONOURED WITH A FRIENDLY LETTER IN THE HANDWRITING OF LEWIS MARY WAS ON THE ROAD TOWARDS THE FRENCH COURT WHEN NEWS CAME THAT HER HUSBAND HAD AFTER A ROUGH VOYAGE LANDED SAFE AT THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF AMBLETEUSE
152-132799-0002 PERSONS OF HIGH RANK WERE INSTANTLY DESPATCHED FROM VERSAILLES TO GREET AND ESCORT HIM MEANWHILE LEWIS ATTENDED BY HIS FAMILY AND HIS NOBILITY WENT FORTH IN STATE TO RECEIVE THE EXILED QUEEN
152-132799-0003 BEFORE HIS GORGEOUS COACH WENT THE SWISS HALBERDIERS ON EACH SIDE OF IT AND BEHIND IT RODE THE BODY GUARDS WITH CYMBALS CLASHING AND TRUMPETS PEALING
152-132799-0004 CAME THE MOST SPLENDID ARISTOCRACY OF EUROPE ALL FEATHERS RIBANDS JEWELS AND EMBROIDERY BEFORE THE PROCESSION HAD GONE FAR IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT MARY WAS APPROACHING LEWIS ALIGHTED AND ADVANCED ON FOOT TO MEET HER
152-132799-0005 SHE BROKE FORTH INTO PASSIONATE EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE MADAM SAID HER HOST IT IS BUT A MELANCHOLY SERVICE THAT I AM RENDERING YOU TO DAY I HOPE THAT I MAY BE ABLE HEREAFTER TO RENDER YOU SERVICES GREATER AND MORE PLEASING
152-132799-0006 HE EMBRACED THE LITTLE PRINCE OF WALES AND MADE THE QUEEN SEAT HERSELF IN THE ROYAL STATE COACH ON THE RIGHT HAND THE CAVALCADE THEN TURNED TOWARDS SAINT GERMAINS
152-132799-0007 AT SAINT GERMAINS ON THE VERGE OF A FOREST SWARMING WITH BEASTS OF CHASE AND ON THE BROW OF A HILL WHICH LOOKS DOWN ON THE WINDINGS OF THE SEINE FRANCIS THE FIRST HAD BUILT A CASTLE AND HENRY THE FOURTH HAD CONSTRUCTED A NOBLE TERRACE
152-132799-0008 OF THE RESIDENCES OF THE FRENCH KINGS NONE STOOD IN A MORE SALUBRIOUS AIR OR COMMANDED A FAIRER PROSPECT THE HUGE SIZE AND VENERABLE AGE OF THE TREES THE BEAUTY OF THE GARDENS THE ABUNDANCE OF THE SPRINGS WERE WIDELY FAMED
152-132799-0009 LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH HAD BEEN BORN THERE HAD WHEN A YOUNG MAN HELD HIS COURT THERE HAD ADDED SEVERAL STATELY PAVILIONS TO THE MANSION OF FRANCIS AND HAD COMPLETED THE TERRACE OF HENRY
152-132799-0010 SOON HOWEVER THE MAGNIFICENT KING CONCEIVED AN INEXPLICABLE DISGUST FOR HIS BIRTHPLACE HE QUITTED SAINT GERMAINS FOR VERSAILLES AND EXPENDED SUMS ALMOST FABULOUS IN THE VAIN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A PARADISE
152-132799-0011 ON A SPOT SINGULARLY STERILE AND UNWHOLESOME ALL SAND OR MUD WITHOUT WOOD WITHOUT WATER AND WITHOUT GAME SAINT GERMAINS HAD NOW BEEN SELECTED TO BE THE ABODE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY OF ENGLAND
152-132799-0012 SUMPTUOUS FURNITURE HAD BEEN HASTILY SENT IN THE NURSERY OF THE PRINCE OF WALES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY FURNISHED WITH EVERYTHING THAT AN INFANT COULD REQUIRE ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS PRESENTED TO THE QUEEN THE KEY OF A SUPERB CASKET WHICH STOOD IN HER APARTMENT
152-132799-0013 SHE OPENED THE CASKET AND FOUND IN IT SIX THOUSAND PISTOLES ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JAMES ARRIVED AT SAINT GERMAINS LEWIS WAS ALREADY THERE TO WELCOME HIM
152-132799-0014 THE UNFORTUNATE EXILE BOWED SO LOW THAT IT SEEMED AS IF HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE THE KNEES OF HIS PROTECTOR LEWIS RAISED HIM AND EMBRACED HIM WITH BROTHERLY TENDERNESS THE TWO KINGS THEN ENTERED THE QUEEN'S ROOM
152-132799-0015 HERE IS A GENTLEMAN SAID LEWIS TO MARY WHOM YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE THEN AFTER ENTREATING HIS GUESTS TO VISIT HIM NEXT DAY AT VERSAILLES AND TO LET HIM HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING THEM HIS BUILDINGS PICTURES AND PLANTATIONS
152-132799-0016 HE TOOK THE UNCEREMONIOUS LEAVE OF AN OLD FRIEND IN A FEW HOURS THE ROYAL PAIR WERE INFORMED THAT AS LONG AS THEY WOULD DO THE KING OF FRANCE THE FAVOUR TO ACCEPT OF HIS HOSPITALITY
152-132799-0017 TEN THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING WERE SENT FOR OUTFIT THE LIBERALITY OF LEWIS HOWEVER
152-132799-0018 WAS MUCH LESS RARE AND ADMIRABLE THAN THE EXQUISITE DELICACY WITH WHICH HE LABOURED TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS OF HIS GUESTS AND TO LIGHTEN THE ALMOST INTOLERABLE WEIGHT OF THE OBLIGATIONS WHICH HE LAID UPON THEM
152-132799-0019 HE WHO HAD HITHERTO ON ALL QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENCE BEEN SENSITIVE LITIGIOUS INSOLENT WHO HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONCE READY TO PLUNGE EUROPE INTO WAR RATHER THAN CONCEDE THE MOST FRIVOLOUS POINT OF ETIQUETTE
152-132799-0020 WAS NOW PUNCTILIOUS INDEED BUT PUNCTILIOUS FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIENDS AGAINST HIMSELF HE GAVE ORDERS THAT MARY SHOULD RECEIVE ALL THE MARKS OF RESPECT THAT HAD EVER BEEN PAID TO HIS OWN DECEASED WIFE
152-132799-0021 SUCH TRIFLES WERE SERIOUS MATTERS AT THE OLD COURT OF FRANCE THERE WERE PRECEDENTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT LEWIS DECIDED THE POINT AGAINST HIS OWN BLOOD SOME LADIES OF ILLUSTRIOUS RANK OMITTED THE CEREMONY OF KISSING THE HEM OF MARY'S ROBE
152-132799-0022 LEWIS REMARKED THE OMISSION AND NOTICED IT IN SUCH A VOICE AND WITH SUCH A LOOK THAT THE WHOLE PEERAGE WAS EVER AFTER READY TO KISS HER SHOE WHEN ESTHER JUST WRITTEN BY RACINE WAS ACTED AT SAINT CYR MARY HAD THE SEAT OF HONOUR
152-132799-0023 JAMES WAS AT HER RIGHT HAND LEWIS MODESTLY PLACED HIMSELF ON THE LEFT NAY HE WAS WELL PLEASED THAT IN HIS OWN PALACE AN OUTCAST LIVING ON HIS BOUNTY SHOULD ASSUME THE TITLE OF KING OF FRANCE
152-132799-0024 SHOULD AS KING OF FRANCE QUARTER THE LILIES WITH THE ENGLISH LIONS AND SHOULD AS KING OF FRANCE DRESS IN VIOLET ON DAYS OF COURT MOURNING THE DEMEANOUR OF THE FRENCH NOBILITY ON PUBLIC OCCASIONS
152-132799-0025 WAS ABSOLUTELY REGULATED BY THEIR SOVEREIGN BUT IT WAS BEYOND EVEN HIS POWER TO PREVENT THEM FROM THINKING FREELY AND FROM EXPRESSING WHAT THEY THOUGHT IN PRIVATE CIRCLES WITH THE KEEN AND DELICATE WIT CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIR NATION AND OF THEIR ORDER
152-132799-0026 THEIR OPINION OF MARY WAS FAVOURABLE THEY FOUND HER PERSON AGREEABLE AND HER DEPORTMENT DIGNIFIED THEY RESPECTED HER COURAGE AND HER MATERNAL AFFECTION AND THEY PITIED HER ILL FORTUNE
152-132799-0027 BUT JAMES THEY REGARDED WITH EXTREME CONTEMPT THEY WERE DISGUSTED BY HIS INSENSIBILITY BY THE COOL WAY IN WHICH HE TALKED TO EVERY BODY OF HIS RUIN AND BY THE CHILDISH PLEASURE WHICH HE TOOK IN THE POMP AND LUXURY OF VERSAILLES
152-132799-0028 THIS STRANGE APATHY THEY ATTRIBUTED NOT TO PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION BUT TO STUPIDITY AND MEANNESS OF SPIRIT
152-132799-0029 FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE EXPEDITION SAILED THE ANXIETY OF THE WHOLE DUTCH NATION HAD BEEN INTENSE NEVER HAD THERE BEEN SUCH CROWDS IN THE CHURCHES NEVER HAD THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PREACHERS BEEN SO ARDENT
152-132799-0030 THE INHABITANTS OF THE HAGUE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM INSULTING ALBEVILLE HIS HOUSE WAS SO CLOSELY BESET BY THE POPULACE DAY AND NIGHT
152-132799-0031 TAKEN ON HIMSELF THE EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION A GENERAL CRY OF PRIDE AND JOY ROSE FROM ALL THE DUTCH FACTIONS AN EXTRAORDINARY MISSION WAS WITH GREAT SPEED DESPATCHED TO CONGRATULATE HIM
152-132799-0032 WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVING TO ALL EUROPE
152-132799-0033 WILLIAM TALKED TO THEM WITH A FRANKNESS AND AN EFFUSION OF HEART WHICH SELDOM APPEARED IN HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH ENGLISHMEN HIS FIRST WORDS WERE WELL AND WHAT DO OUR FRIENDS AT HOME SAY NOW IN TRUTH
152-132799-0034 THE ONLY APPLAUSE BY WHICH HIS STOICAL NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STRONGLY MOVED WAS THE APPLAUSE OF HIS DEAR NATIVE COUNTRY OF HIS IMMENSE POPULARITY IN ENGLAND HE SPOKE WITH COLD DISDAIN
152-132799-0035 AND ELECTED WITHOUT ANY CONTEST FOUR GREAT MERCHANTS WHO WERE ZEALOUS WHIGS THE KING AND HIS ADHERENTS HAD HOPED THAT MANY RETURNING OFFICERS WOULD TREAT THE PRINCE'S LETTER AS A NULLITY BUT THE HOPE WAS DISAPPOINTED
152-132799-0036 THE ELECTIONS WENT ON RAPIDLY AND SMOOTHLY THERE WERE SCARCELY ANY CONTESTS FOR THE NATION HAD DURING MORE THAN A YEAR BEEN KEPT IN CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF A PARLIAMENT WRITS INDEED HAD BEEN TWICE ISSUED AND TWICE RECALLED
152-132799-0037 SOME CONSTITUENT BODIES HAD UNDER THOSE WRITS ACTUALLY PROCEEDED TO THE CHOICE OF REPRESENTATIVES THERE WAS SCARCELY A COUNTY IN WHICH THE GENTRY AND YEOMANRY HAD NOT MANY MONTHS BEFORE FIXED UPON CANDIDATES
152-132799-0038 GOOD PROTESTANTS WHOM NO EXERTIONS MUST BE SPARED TO CARRY IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING AND OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND THESE CANDIDATES WERE NOW GENERALLY RETURNED WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE PRINCE GAVE STRICT ORDERS
152-132799-0039 THE PARTY WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO HIM WAS TRIUMPHANT ENTHUSIASTIC FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY THE PARTY FROM WHICH ALONE HE COULD EXPECT SERIOUS OPPOSITION WAS DISUNITED AND DISHEARTENED OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITSELF
152-132799-0040 AND STILL MORE OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITS NATURAL CHIEF
