6009-57646-0000 THE CHURCH IS ONE HOLY CATHOLIC AND APOSTOLIC PREACHING THE SAME CREED EVERYWHERE AND AT ALL TIMES TEACHING HOLINESS AND TRUTH SHE IS OF COURSE ESSENTIALLY UNERRING IN HER DOCTRINE
6009-57646-0001 FOR WHAT IS ONE HOLY OR UNCHANGEABLE MUST BE INFALLIBLY TRUE THAT THE CHURCH WAS INFALLIBLE IN THE APOSTOLIC AGE IS DENIED BY NO CHRISTIAN
6009-57646-0002 THE NEW TESTAMENT WAS NOT COMPLETED TILL THE CLOSE OF THE FIRST CENTURY THERE IS NO JUST GROUND FOR DENYING TO THE APOSTOLIC TEACHERS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN WHICH WE LIVE A PREROGATIVE CLEARLY POSSESSED BY THOSE OF THE FIRST
6009-57646-0003 THE NO LESS ESSENTIAL GIFT OF INFALLIBILITY GOD LOVES US AS MUCH AS HE LOVED THE PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANS CHRIST DIED FOR US AS WELL AS FOR THEM AND WE HAVE AS MUCH NEED OF UNERRING TEACHERS AS THEY HAD
6009-57646-0004 FOR AN INFALLIBLE BOOK IS OF NO USE TO ME WITHOUT AN INFALLIBLE INTERPRETER AS THE HISTORY OF PROTESTANTISM TOO CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES BUT BESIDES THESE PRESUMPTIVE ARGUMENTS WE HAVE POSITIVE EVIDENCE FROM SCRIPTURE
6009-57646-0005 A SOLEMN PREDICTION THAT NO ERROR SHALL EVER INVADE HIS CHURCH AND IF SHE FELL INTO ERROR
6009-57646-0006 THAT THE GATES OF HELL DID PREVAIL AGAINST HER THAT FROM THE SIXTH TO THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY SHE WAS A SINK OF INIQUITY THE BOOK OF HOMILIES OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND SAYS THAT THE CHURCH
6009-57646-0007 LAY BURIED IN DAMNABLE IDOLATRY FOR EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE THE PERSONAL VERACITY OF OUR SAVIOR AND OF THE REFORMERS IS HERE AT ISSUE
6009-57646-0008 WHICH THEY CONTRADICT WHO IS TO BE BELIEVED JESUS OR THE REFORMERS IF THE PREDICTION OF OUR SAVIOR ABOUT THE PRESERVATION OF HIS CHURCH FROM ERROR BE FALSE THEN JESUS CHRIST IS NOT GOD
6009-57646-0009 CANNOT LIE HE IS NOT EVEN A PROPHET SINCE HE PREDICTED FALSEHOOD NAY HE IS AN IMPOSTOR AND ALL CHRISTIANITY IS A MISERABLE FAILURE AND A HUGE DECEPTION SINCE IT RESTS ON A FALSE PROPHET
6009-57646-0010 BUT IF JESUS PREDICTED THE TRUTH WHEN HE DECLARED THAT THE GATES OF HELL SHOULD NOT PREVAIL AGAINST HIS CHURCH AND WHO DARE DENY IT
6009-57646-0011 THEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS INFALLIBLE FOR SHE ALONE CLAIMS THAT PREROGATIVE AND SHE IS THE ONLY CHURCH THAT IS ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE EXISTED FROM THE BEGINNING TRULY IS JESUS THAT WISE ARCHITECT MENTIONED IN THE GOSPEL
6009-57646-0012 WHO BUILT HIS HOUSE UPON A ROCK AND THE RAIN FELL AND THE FLOODS CAME AND THE WINDS BLEW AND THEY BEAT UPON THAT HOUSE AND IT FELL NOT FOR IT WAS FOUNDED
6009-57646-0013 SINCE IT WAS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE APOSTLES PERSONALLY TO PREACH TO THE WHOLE WORLD NOT ONLY DOES OUR LORD EMPOWER HIS APOSTLES TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
6009-57646-0014 IF THEREFORE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH COULD PREACH ERROR WOULD NOT GOD HIMSELF BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ERROR AND COULD NOT THE FAITHFUL SOUL SAY TO GOD WITH ALL REVERENCE AND TRUTH THOU HAST COMMANDED ME O LORD TO HEAR THY CHURCH
6009-57646-0015 IF I AM DECEIVED BY OBEYING HER THOU ART THE CAUSE OF MY ERROR BUT WE MAY REST ASSURED THAT AN ALL WISE PROVIDENCE WHO COMMANDS HIS CHURCH TO SPEAK IN HIS NAME WILL SO GUIDE HER IN THE PATH OF TRUTH
6009-57646-0016 THAT SHE SHALL NEVER LEAD INTO ERROR THOSE THAT FOLLOW HER TEACHINGS BUT AS THIS PRIVILEGE OF INFALLIBILITY WAS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY FAVOR OUR SAVIOR CONFERS IT ON THE RULERS OF HIS CHURCH IN LANGUAGE WHICH REMOVES ALL DOUBT FROM THE SINCERE INQUIRER
6009-57646-0017 AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ADD TO THE MAJESTY OF HIS WORD SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH JESUS CONSOLES HIS DISCIPLES BY THIS PROMISE I WILL ASK THE FATHER
6009-57646-0018 GO YE THEREFORE AND TEACH ALL NATIONS
6009-57646-0019 GO YE THEREFORE AND TEACH ALL NATIONS ET CETERA HE DOES NOT INSTRUCT THEM TO SCATTER BIBLES BROADCAST OVER THE EARTH BUT TO TEACH BY WORD OF MOUTH AND BEHOLD OUR SAVIOR NEVER ARRESTS THE ATTENTION OF HIS HEARERS
6009-57646-0020 BY USING THE INTERJECTION BEHOLD
6009-57646-0021 I WHO AM THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
6009-57646-0022 I WILL BE WITH YOU NOT MERELY DURING YOUR NATURAL LIVES
6009-57646-0023 WITHOUT INTERMISSION EVEN TO THE END OF THE WORLD THESE WORDS OF JESUS CHRIST ESTABLISH TWO IMPORTANT FACTS FIRST A PROMISE TO GUARD HIS CHURCH FROM ERROR
6009-57646-0024 SECOND A PROMISE THAT HIS PRESENCE WITH THE CHURCH WILL BE CONTINUOUS WITHOUT ANY INTERVAL OF ABSENCE TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE WORLD AND THIS IS ALSO THE SENTIMENT OF THE APOSTLE OF THE GENTILES
6009-57646-0025 WRITING TO THE EPHESIANS GOD GAVE SOME INDEED APOSTLES AND SOME PROPHETS AND SOME EVANGELISTS AND OTHERS PASTORS AND TEACHERS FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS FOR THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY
6009-57646-0026 THEY MAY BE PREACHING FALSEHOOD TO YOU INSTEAD OF TRUTH IF SO YOU ARE IN DOUBT WHETHER YOU ARE LISTENING TO TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD IF YOU ARE IN DOUBT YOU CAN HAVE NO FAITH FOR FAITH EXCLUDES DOUBT
6009-57646-0027 AND INCLUDING SUCH UNQUESTIONED VERACITY
6009-57646-0028 YOU ADMIT INFALLIBLE CERTAINTY IN THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES WHY SHOULD YOU DENY IT IN THE SCIENCE OF SALVATION THE ASTRONOMER CAN PREDICT WITH ACCURACY A HUNDRED YEARS BEFOREHAND AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OR MOON
6009-57646-0029 HE CAN TELL WHAT POINT IN THE HEAVENS A PLANET WILL REACH ON A GIVEN DAY THE MARINER GUIDED BY HIS COMPASS KNOWS AMID THE RAGING STORM AND THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT THAT HE IS STEERING HIS COURSE DIRECTLY TO THE CITY OF HIS DESTINATION
6009-57646-0030 AND IS NOT AN INFALLIBLE GUIDE AS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT YOU TO THE CITY OF GOD IN HEAVEN IS IT NOT MOREOVER A BLESSING AND A CONSOLATION THAT AMID THE EVER CHANGING VIEWS OF MEN AMID THE CONFLICT OF HUMAN OPINION
6009-57646-0031 FOR SIMPLY DECLARING THAT SHE SPEAKS THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH THE ROMAN PANTHEON WAS DEDICATED TO ALL THE GODS OF THE EMPIRE AND THEIR NAME WAS LEGION FORMIDABLE ALSO IN NUMBERS ARE THE FOUNDERS
6009-57646-0032 OF THE RELIGIOUS SECTS EXISTING IN OUR COUNTRY A PANTHEON AS VAST AS WESTMINSTER ABBEY WOULD HARDLY BE SPACIOUS ENOUGH TO CONTAIN LIFE SIZED STATUES FOR THEIR ACCOMMODATION IF YOU WERE TO CONFRONT THOSE FIGURES AND TO ASK THEM ONE BY ONE
6009-57646-0033 TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE FAITH THEY HAD PROFESSED AND IF THEY WERE ENDOWED WITH THE GIFT OF SPEECH YOU WOULD FIND THAT NO TWO OF THEM WERE IN ENTIRE ACCORD BUT THAT THEY ALL DIFFERED AMONG THEMSELVES ON SOME FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF REVELATION
6009-57646-0034 WOULD YOU NOT BE ACTING VERY UNWISELY
6009-57646-0035 OF SO MANY DISCORDANT AND CONFLICTING ORACLES CHILDREN OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH GIVE THANKS TO GOD THAT YOU ARE MEMBERS OF THAT COMMUNION WHICH PROCLAIMS YEAR AFTER YEAR THE ONE SAME AND UNALTERABLE MESSAGE OF TRUTH PEACE AND LOVE
6009-57646-0036 AND THAT YOU ARE PRESERVED FROM ALL ERRORS IN FAITH AND FROM ALL ILLUSION IN THE PRACTICE OF VIRTUE YOU ARE HAPPILY STRANGERS TO THOSE INTERIOR CONFLICTS TO THOSE PERPLEXING DOUBTS AND TO THAT FRIGHTFUL UNCERTAINTY
6009-57646-0037 WHICH DISTRACTS THE SOULS OF THOSE WHOSE PRIVATE JUDGMENT IS THEIR ONLY GUIDE WHO ARE EVER LEARNING AND NEVER ATTAINING TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH
6009-57646-0038 YOU ARE NOT AS BLIND MEN LED BY BLIND GUIDES YOU ARE NOT LIKE THOSE WHO ARE IN THE MIDST OF A SPIRITUAL DESERT INTERSECTED BY VARIOUS BY PATHS NOT KNOWING WHICH TO PURSUE
6009-57646-0039 NEITHER MORMONS NOR MILLERITES NOR THE ADVOCATES OF FREE LOVE OR OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS SO CALLED FIND ANY RECRUITS IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SHE WILL NEVER SUFFER HER CHILDREN TO BE ENSNARED BY THESE IMPOSTURES
6009-57646-0040 HOW SPECIOUS SOEVER THEY MAY BE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN THE PRECEDING PAGES IT FOLLOWS THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH CANNOT BE REFORMED I DO NOT MEAN OF COURSE THAT THE PASTORS OF THE CHURCH ARE PERSONALLY IMPECCABLE
6009-57646-0041 OR NOT SUBJECT TO SIN EVERY TEACHER IN THE CHURCH FROM THE POPE DOWN TO THE HUMBLEST PRIEST IS LIABLE AT ANY MOMENT LIKE ANY OF THE FAITHFUL TO FALL FROM GRACE AND TO STAND IN NEED OF MORAL REFORMATION
6009-57646-0042 WE ALL CARRY THIS TREASURE OF INNOCENCE IN EARTHEN VESSELS MY MEANING IS THAT THE CHURCH IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE OF BEING REFORMED IN HER DOCTRINES THE CHURCH IS THE WORK OF AN INCARNATE GOD
6009-57646-0043 LIKE ALL GOD'S WORKS IT IS PERFECT IT IS THEREFORE INCAPABLE OF REFORM IS IT NOT THE HEIGHT OF PRESUMPTION FOR MEN TO ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE UPON THE WORK OF GOD
6009-57646-0044 FOR THE LUTHERS THE CALVINS THE KNOXES AND THE HENRIES AND A THOUSAND LESSER LIGHTS TO BE OFFERING THEIR AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH AS IF IT WERE A HUMAN INSTITUTION OUR LORD HIMSELF HAS NEVER CEASED TO RULE PERSONALLY OVER HIS CHURCH
6009-57646-0045 IT IS TIME ENOUGH FOR LITTLE MEN TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE SHIP WHEN THE GREAT CAPTAIN ABANDONS THE HELM A PROTESTANT GENTLEMAN OF VERY LIBERAL EDUCATION REMARKED TO ME BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE LATE ECUMENICAL COUNCIL
6009-57646-0046 THAT THE DOCTRINAL DECREES OF THE CHURCH WERE IRREVOCABLE AND THAT THE DOGMA OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION WAS DEFINED ONCE AND FOREVER IF ONLY ONE INSTANCE COULD BE GIVEN IN WHICH THE CHURCH CEASED TO TEACH A DOCTRINE OF FAITH WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY HELD
6009-57646-0047 THAT SINGLE INSTANCE WOULD BE THE DEATH BLOW OF HER CLAIM TO INFALLIBILITY BUT IT IS A MARVELOUS FACT WORTHY OF RECORD THAT IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH FROM THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO THE FIRST
6009-57646-0048 OUGHT TO BE A SUFFICIENT WARRANT THAT SHE WILL TOLERATE NO DOCTRINAL VARIATIONS IN THE FUTURE IF AS WE HAVE SEEN THE CHURCH HAS AUTHORITY FROM GOD TO TEACH AND IF SHE TEACHES NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
6009-57646-0049 IS IT NOT THE DUTY OF ALL CHRISTIANS TO HEAR HER VOICE AND OBEY HER COMMANDS SHE IS THE ORGAN OF THE HOLY GHOST SHE IS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF JESUS CHRIST WHO HAS SAID TO HER HE THAT HEARETH YOU HEARETH ME
6009-57646-0050 HE THAT DESPISETH YOU DESPISETH ME SHE IS THE MISTRESS OF TRUTH IT IS THE PROPERTY OF THE HUMAN MIND TO EMBRACE TRUTH WHEREVER IT FINDS IT IT WOULD THEREFORE BE NOT ONLY AN ACT OF IRREVERENCE
6009-57646-0051 BUT OF SHEER FOLLY TO DISOBEY THE VOICE OF THIS EVER TRUTHFUL MOTHER IF A CITIZEN IS BOUND TO OBEY THE LAWS OF HIS COUNTRY THOUGH THESE LAWS MAY NOT IN ALL RESPECTS BE CONFORMABLE TO STRICT JUSTICE
6009-57646-0052 IF A CHILD IS BOUND BY NATURAL AND DIVINE LAW TO OBEY HIS MOTHER THOUGH SHE MAY SOMETIMES ERR IN HER JUDGMENTS HOW MUCH MORE STRICTLY ARE NOT WE OBLIGED TO BE DOCILE TO THE TEACHINGS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH OUR MOTHER
6009-57646-0053 WHOSE ADMONITIONS ARE ALWAYS JUST WHOSE PRECEPTS ARE IMMUTABLE FOR TWENTY YEARS OBSERVED A RECENTLY CONVERTED MINISTER OF THE PROTESTANT CHURCH I FOUGHT AND STRUGGLED AGAINST THE CHURCH WITH ALL THE ENERGY OF MY WILL
6009-57646-0054 BUT WHEN I BECAME A CATHOLIC ALL MY DOUBTS ENDED MY INQUIRIES CEASED I BECAME AS A LITTLE CHILD AND RUSHED LIKE A LISPING BABE INTO THE ARMS OF MY MOTHER BY BAPTISM
6009-57646-0055 CHRISTIANS BECOME CHILDREN OF THE CHURCH NO MATTER WHO POURS UPON THEM THE REGENERATING WATERS IF SHE IS OUR MOTHER WHERE IS OUR LOVE AND OBEDIENCE
6009-57646-0056 THE CHRISTIAN SHOULD HAVE FOR HIS SPIRITUAL MOTHER ALL THE SIMPLICITY ALL THE CREDULITY I MIGHT SAY OF A CHILD GUIDED BY THE INSTINCTS OF FAITH UNLESS YE BECOME SAYS OUR LORD
