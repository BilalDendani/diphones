4427-12471-0000 SO THEY WERE FORCED TO TRAVEL OVER THIS COUNTRY AS HAVING NO OTHER COUNTRY BUT THIS TO TRAVEL IN THEY HAD INDEED CARRIED WATER ALONG WITH THEM FROM THE LAND OVER WHICH THEY HAD TRAVELED BEFORE AS THEIR CONDUCTOR HAD BIDDEN THEM
4427-12471-0001 BUT WHEN THAT WAS SPENT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DRAW WATER OUT OF WELLS WITH PAIN BY REASON OF THE HARDNESS OF THE SOIL MOREOVER WHAT WATER THEY FOUND WAS BITTER AND NOT FIT FOR DRINKING AND THIS IN SMALL QUANTITIES ALSO
4427-12471-0002 FOR MAR DENOTES BITTERNESS THITHER THEY CAME AFFLICTED BOTH BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF THEIR JOURNEY AND BY THEIR WANT OF FOOD FOR IT ENTIRELY FAILED THEM AT THAT TIME
4427-12471-0003 NOW HERE WAS A WELL WHICH MADE THEM CHOOSE TO STAY IN THE PLACE WHICH ALTHOUGH IT WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY SO GREAT AN ARMY DID YET AFFORD THEM SOME COMFORT AS FOUND IN SUCH DESERT PLACES FOR THEY HEARD FROM THOSE WHO HAD BEEN TO SEARCH
4427-12471-0004 FOR THE PEOPLE WERE NOT IN THE NATURE OF A COMPLETE ARMY OF MEN WHO MIGHT OPPOSE A MANLY FORTITUDE TO THE NECESSITY THAT DISTRESSED THEM THE MULTITUDE OF THE CHILDREN AND OF THE WOMEN ALSO BEING OF TOO WEAK CAPACITIES TO BE PERSUADED BY REASON BLUNTED THE COURAGE OF THE MEN THEMSELVES
4427-12471-0005 HE WAS THEREFORE IN GREAT DIFFICULTIES AND MADE EVERYBODY'S CALAMITY HIS OWN FOR THEY RAN ALL OF THEM TO HIM AND BEGGED OF HIM THE WOMEN BEGGED FOR THEIR INFANTS AND THE MEN FOR THE WOMEN THAT HE WOULD NOT OVERLOOK THEM
4427-12471-0006 AND HAD PROMISED TO RENDER THE WATER SUCH AS THEY DESIRED IT TO BE IN CASE THEY WOULD BE SUBSERVIENT TO HIM IN WHAT HE SHOULD ENJOIN THEM TO DO AND THIS NOT AFTER A REMISS OR NEGLIGENT MANNER AND WHEN THEY ASKED WHAT THEY WERE TO DO IN ORDER TO HAVE THE WATER CHANGED FOR THE BETTER
4427-12471-0007 THAT WHEN THE GREATEST PART WAS DRAWN UP THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FIT TO DRINK SO THEY LABORED AT IT TILL THE WATER WAS SO AGITATED AND PURGED
4427-12471-0008 AND MEETING WITH NO RELIEF THEY WERE IN A VERY DESPONDING CONDITION AND BY FIXING THEIR ATTENTION UPON NOTHING BUT THEIR PRESENT MISFORTUNES THEY WERE HINDERED FROM REMEMBERING WHAT DELIVERANCES THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM GOD AND THOSE BY THE VIRTUE AND WISDOM OF MOSES ALSO
4427-12471-0009 AND HAD STONES IN THEIR HANDS IN ORDER TO DESPATCH HIM
4427-12471-0010 SEEING IT IS PROBABLE THAT GOD TRIES THEIR VIRTUE AND EXERCISES THEIR PATIENCE BY THESE ADVERSITIES THAT IT MAY APPEAR WHAT FORTITUDE THEY HAVE AND WHAT MEMORY THEY RETAIN OF HIS FORMER WONDERFUL WORKS IN THEIR FAVOR
4427-12471-0011 AND WHETHER THEY WILL NOT THINK OF THEM UPON OCCASION OF THE MISERIES THEY NOW FEEL HE TOLD THEM IT APPEARED THEY WERE NOT REALLY GOOD MEN EITHER IN PATIENCE OR IN REMEMBERING WHAT HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DONE FOR THEM
4427-12471-0012 HE ALSO PUT THEM IN MIND OF ALL THAT HAD PASSED HOW THE EGYPTIANS WERE DESTROYED WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO DETAIN THEM CONTRARY TO THE COMMAND OF GOD AND AFTER WHAT MANNER THE VERY SAME RIVER WAS TO THE OTHERS BLOODY AND NOT FIT FOR DRINKING
4427-12471-0013 BUT WAS TO THEM SWEET AND FIT FOR DRINKING AND HOW THEY WENT A NEW ROAD THROUGH THE SEA WHICH FLED A LONG WAY FROM THEM BY WHICH VERY MEANS THEY WERE THEMSELVES PRESERVED BUT SAW THEIR ENEMIES DESTROYED
4427-12471-0014 AND THAT WHEN THEY WERE IN WANT OF WEAPONS GOD GAVE THEM PLENTY OF THEM AND SO HE RECOUNTED ALL THE PARTICULAR INSTANCES HOW WHEN THEY WERE IN APPEARANCE JUST GOING TO BE DESTROYED GOD HAD SAVED THEM IN A SURPRISING MANNER
4427-12471-0015 THOUGH IT COME NOT IMMEDIATELY IF IT BE PRESENT WITH THEM BEFORE THEY SUFFER ANY GREAT MISFORTUNE THAT THEY OUGHT TO REASON THUS THAT GOD DELAYS TO ASSIST THEM NOT BECAUSE HE HAS NO REGARD TO THEM BUT BECAUSE HE WILL FIRST TRY THEIR FORTITUDE AND THE PLEASURE THEY TAKE IN THEIR FREEDOM
4427-12471-0016 BUT ONLY IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MORE USEFUL IN THEIR SERVICE THAT AS FOR HIMSELF HE SHALL NOT BE SO MUCH CONCERNED FOR HIS OWN PRESERVATION FOR IF HE DIE UNJUSTLY HE SHALL NOT RECKON IT ANY AFFLICTION BUT THAT HE IS CONCERNED FOR THEM LEST BY CASTING STONES AT HIM
4427-12471-0017 AND BROUGHT THEM TO REPENT OF WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THE NECESSITY THEY WERE UNDER MADE THEIR PASSION LESS UNJUSTIFIABLE HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO APPLY HIMSELF TO GOD BY PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION AND GOING UP TO AN EMINENCE
4427-12471-0018 AND HE DESIRED THAT HE WOULD FORGIVE WHAT NECESSITY HAD FORCED THE PEOPLE TO DO SINCE SUCH WAS THE NATURE OF MANKIND HARD TO PLEASE AND VERY COMPLAINING UNDER ADVERSITIES ACCORDINGLY GOD PROMISED HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF THEM AND AFFORD THEM THE SUCCOR THEY WERE DESIROUS OF
4427-12471-0019 AND TOLD THEM HE CAME TO BRING THEM FROM GOD A DELIVERANCE FROM THEIR PRESENT DISTRESSES
4427-12471-0020 THEY FELL DOWN UPON THE HEBREWS WHO CAUGHT THEM AND SATISFIED THEIR HUNGER WITH THEM AND SUPPOSED THAT THIS WAS THE METHOD WHEREBY GOD MEANT TO SUPPLY THEM WITH FOOD UPON WHICH MOSES RETURNED THANKS TO GOD FOR AFFORDING THEM HIS ASSISTANCE SO SUDDENLY
4427-12471-0021 A DEW FELL DOWN AND MOSES WHEN HE FOUND IT STICK TO HIS HANDS SUPPOSED THIS WAS ALSO COME FOR FOOD FROM GOD TO THEM HE TASTED IT AND PERCEIVING THAT THE PEOPLE KNEW NOT WHAT IT WAS AND THOUGHT IT SNOWED AND THAT IT WAS WHAT USUALLY FELL AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR
4427-12471-0022 HE INFORMED THEM THAT THIS DEW DID NOT FALL FROM HEAVEN AFTER THE MANNER THEY IMAGINED BUT CAME FOR THEIR PRESERVATION AND SUSTENANCE SO HE TASTED IT AND GAVE THEM SOME OF IT THAT THEY MIGHT BE SATISFIED ABOUT WHAT HE TOLD THEM THEY ALSO IMITATED THEIR CONDUCTOR AND WERE PLEASED WITH THE FOOD
4427-12471-0023 FOR IT WAS LIKE HONEY IN SWEETNESS AND PLEASANT TASTE BUT LIKE IN ITS BODY TO BDELLIUM ONE OF THE SWEET SPICES
4427-12471-0024 HOWEVER THESE STRONG MEN WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED MORE THAN THE MEASURE APPOINTED FOR THEM HAD NO MORE THAN OTHERS BUT ONLY TIRED THEMSELVES MORE IN GATHERING IT FOR THEY FOUND NO MORE THAN AN OMER APIECE AND THE ADVANTAGE THEY GOT BY WHAT WAS SUPERFLUOUS WAS NONE AT ALL IT CORRUPTING
4427-12471-0025 BOTH BY THE WORMS BREEDING IN IT AND BY ITS BITTERNESS SO DIVINE AND WONDERFUL A FOOD WAS THIS IT ALSO SUPPLIED THE WANT OF OTHER SORTS OF FOOD TO THOSE THAT FED ON IT
4427-12471-0026 AND THEN BETOOK HIMSELF TO PRAYER TO GOD BESEECHING HIM THAT AS HE HAD GIVEN THEM FOOD WHEN THEY WERE IN THE GREATEST WANT OF IT SO HE WOULD GIVE THEM DRINK SINCE THE FAVOR OF GIVING THEM FOOD WAS OF NO VALUE TO THEM WHILE THEY HAD NOTHING TO DRINK
4427-12471-0027 AND OUT OF IT TO RECEIVE PLENTY OF WHAT THEY WANTED FOR HE HAD TAKEN CARE THAT DRINK SHOULD COME TO THEM WITHOUT ANY LABOR OR PAINS TAKING WHEN MOSES HAD RECEIVED THIS COMMAND FROM GOD HE CAME TO THE PEOPLE WHO WAITED FOR HIM AND LOOKED UPON HIM
4427-12471-0028 BUT THEY WERE ASTONISHED AT THIS WONDERFUL EFFECT AND AS IT WERE QUENCHED THEIR THIRST BY THE VERY SIGHT OF IT SO THEY DRANK THIS PLEASANT THIS SWEET WATER AND SUCH IT SEEMED TO BE AS MIGHT WELL BE EXPECTED WHERE GOD WAS THE DONOR
4427-12471-0029 THEY WERE ALSO IN ADMIRATION HOW MOSES WAS HONORED BY GOD AND THEY MADE GRATEFUL RETURNS OF SACRIFICES TO GOD FOR HIS PROVIDENCE TOWARDS THEM
