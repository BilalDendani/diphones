7933-113273-0000 THE SEARCH IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED OF COURSE THAT THE FLIGHT OF LITTLE NELL AND HER GRANDFATHER FROM THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP WAS NOT NOTICED ALL THE TIME WHILE THEY WERE WANDERING ABOUT HOMELESS AND WRETCHED
7933-113273-0001 MORE THAN ONE WENT SEARCHING EVERYWHERE FOR THEM WITHOUT SUCCESS ONE OF THESE WAS QUILP THE UGLY DWARF HE HAD LOANED THE GRANDFATHER MORE MONEY THAN THE SHOP WOULD BRING
7933-113273-0002 AND HE MADE UP HIS MIND NOW THAT THE OLD MAN HAD A SECRET HOARD SOMEWHERE WHICH MIGHT BE HIS IF HE COULD FIND IT HE SOON LEARNED THAT IF KIT KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HE WOULD NOT TELL SO HE AND HIS LAWYER A SLEEK OILY RASCAL NAMED BRASS
7933-113273-0003 HE KEPT IN HIS ROOM A BIG BOX LIKE TRUNK IN WHICH WAS A SILVER STOVE THAT HE USED TO COOK HIS MEALS THE STOVE HAD A LOT OF LITTLE OPENINGS IN ONE HE WOULD PUT AN EGG IN ANOTHER SOME COFFEE IN ANOTHER A PIECE OF MEAT AND IN THE FOURTH
7933-113273-0004 SOME WATER THEN HE WOULD LIGHT A LAMP THAT STOOD UNDER IT AND IN FIVE MINUTES THE EGG WOULD BE COOKED THE COFFEE BOILED AND THE MEAT DONE ALL READY TO EAT HE WAS THE QUEEREST SORT OF BOARDER THE STRANGEST HABIT HE HAD WAS THIS
7933-113273-0005 HE SEEMED TO BE VERY FOND OF PUNCH AND JUDY SHOWS AND WHENEVER HE HEARD ONE ON THE STREET HE WOULD RUN OUT WITHOUT HIS HAT
7933-113273-0006 AND THEN INVITE THEM TO HIS ROOMS WHERE HE WOULD QUESTION THEM FOR A LONG TIME
7933-113273-0007 THE TRUTH WAS THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER WAS A LONG MISSING BROTHER OF LITTLE NELL'S GRANDFATHER A MISUNDERSTANDING HAD COME BETWEEN THEM MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN BOTH WERE YOUNG MEN THE YOUNGER HAD BECOME A TRAVELER IN MANY COUNTRIES AND HAD NEVER SEEN HIS BROTHER SINCE
7933-113273-0008 HE HAD COME BACK NOW TO ENGLAND A RICH MAN TO FIND THE OTHER HAD VANISHED WITH LITTLE NELL HIS GRANDCHILD HE HAD SOON LEARNED THE STORY OF THEIR MISFORTUNE AND HOW THE FEAR OF QUILP HAD DRIVEN THEM AWAY
7933-113273-0009 THAT THE CHILD AND THE OLD MAN HAD DISAPPEARED AT THE FAIR AND THAT SINCE THEN SO THEY HAD HEARD A PAIR RESEMBLING THEM HAD BEEN SEEN WITH THE JARLEY WAXWORK EXHIBITION THE STRANGER EASILY DISCOVERED WHERE MISSUS JARLEY WAS AND DETERMINED TO SET OUT TO HER AT ONCE
7933-113273-0010 BUT HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS BROTHER LITTLE NELL'S GRANDFATHER COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO KNOW HIM AFTER ALL THE YEARS HE HAD BEEN GONE AND AS FOR LITTLE NELL HERSELF SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM AND HE WAS AFRAID IF THEY HEARD A STRANGE MAN HAD COME FOR THEM THEY WOULD TAKE FRIGHT AND RUN AWAY AGAIN
7933-113273-0011 SO HE TRIED TO FIND SOME ONE THEY HAD LOVED TO GO WITH HIM TO SHOW THAT HE INTENDED ONLY KINDNESS HE WAS NOT LONG IN HEARING OF KIT WHO HAD FOUND A SITUATION AS FOOTMAN AND HE GAINED HIS EMPLOYER'S LEAVE TO TAKE THE LAD WITH HIM
7933-113273-0012 AND THAT HER GRANDFATHER BLAMED HIM AS THE CAUSE OF THEIR MISFORTUNE
7933-113273-0013 BUT KIT PROMISED THE STRANGER THAT HIS MOTHER SHOULD GO IN HIS PLACE AND WENT TO TELL HER AT ONCE KIT FOUND HIS MOTHER WAS AT CHURCH BUT THE MATTER WAS SO URGENT THAT HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PEW AND BROUGHT HER OUT WHICH CAUSED EVEN THE MINISTER TO PAUSE IN HIS SERMON
7933-113273-0014 AND MADE ALL THE CONGREGATION LOOK SURPRISED KIT TOOK HER HOME PACKED HER BOX AND BUNDLED HER INTO THE COACH WHICH THE STRANGER BROUGHT AND AWAY THEY WENT TO FIND THE WANDERERS NOW QUILP HAD ALL ALONG SUSPECTED THAT KIT AND HIS MOTHER
7933-113273-0015 KNEW SOMETHING OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS AND HE HAD MADE IT HIS BUSINESS TO WATCH EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER THE DWARF IN FACT WAS IN THE CHURCH WHEN KIT CAME FOR HIS MOTHER AND HE FOLLOWED WHEN SHE LEFT WITH THE STRANGER HE TOOK ANOTHER COACH AND PURSUED FEELING CERTAIN HE WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK
7933-113273-0016 BUT THEY WERE ALL TOO LATE WHEN THE STRANGER FOUND MISSUS JARLEY NEXT DAY SHE COULD ONLY TELL HIM THAT LITTLE NELL AND HER GRANDFATHER HAD DISAPPEARED AGAIN AND HE HAD TO RETURN WITH KIT'S MOTHER MUCH DISCOURAGED TO LONDON
7933-113273-0017 THE PART KIT HAD PLAYED IN THIS MADE THE DWARF HATE HIM IF POSSIBLE MORE THAN EVER AND HE AGREED TO PAY BRASS HIS RASCALLY LAWYER TO RUIN THE LAD BY MAKING A FALSE CHARGE OF THEFT AGAINST HIM
7933-113273-0018 KIT WAS ARRESTED AND THE NOTE OF COURSE WAS FOUND ON HIS PERSON THE EVIDENCE SEEMED SO STRONG THAT THE POOR FELLOW WAS QUICKLY TRIED FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR A LONG TIME ALL MIGHT HAVE GONE WRONG BUT FOR A LITTLE MAID SERVANT OF BRASS'S
7933-113273-0019 WHOM THE LAWYER HAD STARVED AND MISTREATED FOR YEARS HE USED TO KEEP HER LOCKED IN THE MOLDY CELLAR AND GAVE HER SO LITTLE TO EAT THAT SHE WOULD CREEP INTO THE OFFICE AT NIGHT SHE HAD FOUND A KEY THAT FITTED THE DOOR TO PICK UP THE BITS OF BREAD THAT DICK SWIVELLER BRASS'S CLERK
7933-113273-0020 AFTER KIT WAS ARRESTED SHE RAN AWAY FROM BRASS'S HOUSE AND TOLD HER STORY TO KIT'S EMPLOYER WHO HAD ALL ALONG BELIEVED IN HIS INNOCENCE
7933-113273-0021 THIS SO ENRAGED THE LAWYER THAT WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE LITTLE MAID'S EVIDENCE AND FOUND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS CAUGHT HE MADE FULL CONFESSION OF THE PART QUILP HAD PLAYED AND TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO REVENGE HIMSELF ON THE DWARF
7933-113273-0022 THE DWARF RECEIVED WARNING FROM SALLY BRASS BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO GET AWAY WHEN HE HEARD THE KNOCKING ON THE GATES AND KNEW THAT THE LAW HE HAD SO LONG DEFIED WAS AT LAST UPON HIM HE FELL INTO A PANIC AND DID NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN
7933-113273-0023 HE TRIED TO COVER THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE BUT ONLY SUCCEEDED IN UPSETTING THE STOVE THEN HE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE ON TO THE DOCK IN THE DARKNESS IT WAS A BLACK FOGGY NIGHT AND HE COULD NOT SEE A FOOT BEFORE HIM HE THOUGHT HE COULD CLIMB OVER THE WALL TO THE NEXT WHARF AND SO ESCAPE
7933-113273-0024 BUT IN HIS FRIGHT HE MISSED HIS WAY AND FELL OVER THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM INTO THE SWIFT FLOWING RIVER HE SCREAMED IN TERROR BUT THE WATER FILLED HIS THROAT AND THE KNOCKING ON THE GATES WAS SO LOUD THAT NO ONE HEARD HIM THE WATER SWEPT HIM CLOSE TO A SHIP
7933-113273-0025 THE WAVES THREW HIS DROWNED BODY FINALLY ON THE EDGE OF A DISMAL SWAMP IN THE RED GLARE OF THE BLAZING RUIN WHICH THE OVERTURNED STOVE THAT NIGHT MADE OF THE BUILDING IN WHICH HE HAD FRAMED HIS EVIL PLOTS AND THIS WAS THE END OF QUILP THE DWARF
7933-113273-0026 AS FOR KIT HE FOUND HIMSELF ALL AT ONCE NOT ONLY FREE BUT A HERO HIS EMPLOYER CAME TO THE JAIL TO TELL HIM THAT HE WAS FREE AND THAT EVERYONE KNEW NOW OF HIS INNOCENCE AND THEY MADE HIM EAT AND DRINK AND EVERYBODY SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM
7933-113273-0027 THEN HE WAS PUT INTO A COACH AND THEY DROVE STRAIGHT HOME WHERE HIS MOTHER WAS WAITING TO KISS HIM AND CRY OVER HIM WITH JOY AND LAST BUT BY NO MEANS LEAST OF ALL HIS NEW GOOD FORTUNE
7933-113273-0028 HE LEARNED THEN THAT THE STRANGER WHO HAD BEEN SEARCHING SO LONG FOR LITTLE NELL AND HER GRANDFATHER HAD FOUND CERTAINLY WHERE THEY WERE AND THAT KIT WAS TO GO WITH HIM AND HIS EMPLOYER AT ONCE AND BRING THEM BACK AGAIN TO LONDON THEY STARTED THE NEXT DAY AND ON THE LONG ROAD
7933-113273-0029 THEY TALKED MUCH OF LITTLE NELL AND THE STRANGE CHANCE BY WHICH THE LOST HAD BEEN FOUND A GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED IN THE VILLAGE TO WHICH THEY WERE NOW BOUND WHO HAD HIMSELF BEEN KIND TO THE CHILD AND TO THE OLD MAN WHOM THE NEW SCHOOLMASTER HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM HAD WRITTEN OF THE PAIR TO KIT'S EMPLOYER
