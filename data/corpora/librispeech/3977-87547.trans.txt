3977-87547-0000 THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THEM IS A CONFIRMATION OF MY CONJECTURE THAT FIXED AIR IS CAPABLE OF FORMING AN UNION WITH PHLOGISTON AND THEREBY BECOMING A KIND OF AIR THAT IS NOT MISCIBLE WITH WATER I HAD PRODUCED THIS EFFECT BEFORE BY MEANS OF IRON FILINGS AND BRIMSTONE
3977-87547-0001 FERMENTING IN THIS KIND OF AIR BUT I HAVE SINCE HAD A MUCH MORE DECISIVE AND ELEGANT PROOF OF IT BY ELECTRICITY FOR AFTER TAKING A SMALL ELECTRIC EXPLOSION FOR ABOUT AN HOUR IN THE SPACE OF AN INCH OF FIXED AIR
3977-87547-0002 I FOUND THAT WHEN WATER WAS ADMITTED TO IT ONLY ONE FOURTH OF THE AIR WAS IMBIBED PROBABLY THE WHOLE OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RENDERED IMMISCIBLE IN WATER IF THE ELECTRICAL OPERATION HAD BEEN CONTINUED A SUFFICIENT TIME
3977-87547-0003 THIS AIR CONTINUED SEVERAL DAYS IN WATER AND WAS EVEN AGITATED IN WATER WITHOUT ANY FARTHER DIMINUTION IT WAS NOT HOWEVER COMMON AIR FOR IT WAS NOT DIMINISHED BY NITROUS AIR
3977-87547-0004 BY MEANS OF IRON FILINGS AND BRIMSTONE I HAVE SINCE MY FORMER EXPERIMENTS PROCURED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THIS KIND OF AIR IN A METHOD SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH I USED BEFORE
3977-87547-0005 AND EXHAUSTED IT WITH A PUMP OF MISTER SMEATON'S CONSTRUCTION I FILLED IT WITH FIXED AIR AND THEN LEFT IT PLUNGED UNDER WATER SO THAT NO COMMON AIR COULD HAVE ACCESS TO IT IN THIS MANNER AND IN ABOUT A WEEK THERE WAS
3977-87547-0006 AS NEAR AS I CAN RECOLLECT ONE SIXTH OR AT LEAST ONE EIGHTH OF THE WHOLE CONVERTED INTO A PERMANENT AIR NOT IMBIBED BY WATER
3977-87547-0007 FROM THIS EXPERIMENT I EXPECTED THAT THE SAME EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ON FIXED AIR BY THE FUMES OF LIVER OF SULPHUR BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THAT EXPECTATION WHICH SURPRISED ME NOT A LITTLE
3977-87547-0008 TO THE EFFECT OF PHLOGISTON EXHALED FROM THIS SUBSTANCE ON ACID AIR PERHAPS MORE TIME MAY BE REQUISITE FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR THIS PROCESS WAS NOT CONTINUED MORE THAN A DAY AND A NIGHT IRON FILINGS AND BRIMSTONE
3977-87547-0009 I HAVE OBSERVED FERMENT WITH GREAT HEAT IN NITROUS AIR AND I HAVE SINCE OBSERVED THAT THIS PROCESS IS ATTENDED WITH GREATER HEAT IN FIXED AIR THAN IN COMMON AIR
3977-87547-0010 AS I OBSERVED BEFORE I IMAGINED THAT IF IT COULD HAVE DISSOLVED IRON THE PHLOGISTON WOULD HAVE UNITED WITH THE AIR AND HAVE MADE IT IMMISCIBLE WITH WATER AS IN THE FORMER INSTANCES
3977-87547-0011 NEITHER THE IRON NOR THE AIR APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THEIR MUTUAL CONTACT HAVING EXPOSED EQUAL QUANTITIES OF COMMON AND FIXED AIR IN EQUAL AND SIMILAR CYLINDRICAL GLASS VESSELS TO EQUAL DEGREES OF HEAT
3977-87547-0012 BY PLACING THEM BEFORE A FIRE AND FREQUENTLY CHANGING THEIR SITUATIONS I OBSERVED THAT THEY WERE EXPANDED EXACTLY ALIKE AND WHEN REMOVED FROM THE FIRE THEY BOTH RECOVERED THEIR FORMER DIMENSIONS
3977-87547-0013 MIGHT ALSO YIELD SOME FIXED AIR WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE CONTAINED IN THE SALT OF TARTAR FROM WHICH IT IS MADE I MIXED THE TWO INGREDIENTS VIZ SALT OF TARTAR AND BRIMSTONE
3977-87547-0014 AND APPLYING THE FLAME OF A CANDLE TO IT SO AS TO FORM THE LIVER OF SULPHUR I RECEIVED THE AIR THAT CAME FROM IT IN THIS PROCESS IN A VESSEL OF QUICKSILVER IN THIS MANNER I PROCURED A VERY CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF FIXED AIR
3977-87547-0015 I PUT ABOUT THE QUANTITY OF HALF A NUT SHELL FULL OF ETHER INCLOSED IN A GLASS TUBE THROUGH A BODY OF QUICKSILVER INTO AN OUNCE MEASURE OF COMMON AIR CONFINED BY QUICKSILVER
3977-87547-0016 WITHDRAWING THE QUICKSILVER AND ADMITTING WATER TO THIS AIR WITHOUT ANY AGITATION IT BEGAN TO BE ABSORBED BUT ONLY ABOUT HALF AN OUNCE MEASURE HAD DISAPPEARED AFTER IT HAD STOOD AN HOUR IN THE WATER
3977-87547-0017 BUT BY ONCE PASSING IT THROUGH WATER THE AIR WAS REDUCED TO ITS ORIGINAL DIMENSIONS BEING TRIED BY A MIXTURE OF NITROUS AIR IT APPEARED NOT TO BE SO GOOD AS FRESH AIR THOUGH THE INJURY IT HAD RECEIVED WAS NOT CONSIDERABLE
3977-87547-0018 FIXED AIR WAS NOT SO MUCH INCREASED AS THE REST AND PHLOGISTICATED AIR LESS BUT AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE WATER
3977-87547-0019 THE VAPOURS BEING SOON CONDENSED BY COLD LIKE THE VAPOUR OF WATER
3977-87547-0020 I MADE IT BOIL AND CATCHED THE AIR WHICH HAD RESTED ON THE SURFACE OF THE SPIRIT AND WHICH HAD BEEN EXPELLED BY THE HEAT TOGETHER WITH THE VAPOUR IN A VESSEL OF QUICKSILVER AND AFTERWARDS ADMITTED ACID AIR TO IT THE VESSEL WAS FILLED WITH WHITE FUMES
3977-87547-0021 AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A MIXTURE OF ALKALINE AIR ALONG WITH IT TO WHAT THIS APPEARANCE WAS OWING I CANNOT TELL AND INDEED I DID NOT EXAMINE INTO IT THREE HAVING BEEN INFORMED BY DOCTOR SMALL AND MISTER BOLTON OF BIRMINGHAM
3977-87547-0022 A FACT WHICH I AFTERWARDS FOUND MENTIONED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS WOULD BE VERY CONVENIENT FOR EXPERIMENTS RELATING TO IGNITION IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF AIR AND INDEED I FOUND THAT IT WAS EASILY FIRED
3977-87547-0023 AND THAT ANY PART OF IT BEING ONCE FIRED
3977-87547-0024 ALL THE KINDS OF AIR IN WHICH THIS PAPER WAS BURNED RECEIVED AN ADDITION TO THEIR BULK WHICH CONSISTED PARTLY OF NITROUS AIR FROM THE NITROUS PRECIPITATE AND PARTLY OF INFLAMMABLE AIR FROM THE PAPER
3977-87547-0025 AS SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE IGNITION OF THIS PAPER IN SOME OF THE KINDS OF AIR WERE A LITTLE REMARKABLE I SHALL JUST RECITE THEM FIRING THIS PAPER IN INFLAMMABLE AIR
3977-87547-0026 WHICH IT DID WITHOUT ANY IGNITION OF THE INFLAMMABLE AIR ITSELF THE QUANTITY INCREASED REGULARLY
3977-87547-0027 BUT THEN IT BEGAN TO DECREASE TILL ONE THIRD OF THE WHOLE QUANTITY DISAPPEARED A PIECE OF THIS PAPER BEING PUT TO THREE OUNCE MEASURES OF ACID AIR A GREAT PART OF IT PRESENTLY TURNED YELLOW AND THE AIR WAS REDUCED TO ONE THIRD OF THE ORIGINAL QUANTITY
3977-87547-0028 I SET FIRE TO THE PAPER IMMEDIATELY UPON WHICH THERE WAS A PRODUCTION OF AIR
3977-87547-0029 TO BE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM PURE NITROUS AIR I REPEATED THIS EXPERIMENT WITH THE SAME EVENT PAPER DIPPED IN A SOLUTION OF MERCURY ZINC OR IRON IN NITROUS ACID HAS IN A SMALL DEGREE
3977-87547-0030 THE SAME PROPERTY WITH PAPER DIPPED IN A SOLUTION OF COPPER IN THE SAME ACID FOUR GUNPOWDER IS ALSO FIRED IN ALL KINDS OF AIR AND IN THE QUANTITY IN WHICH I TRIED IT DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSIBLE CHANGE IN THEM
3977-87547-0031 EXCEPT THAT THE COMMON AIR IN WHICH IT WAS FIRED WOULD NOT AFTERWARDS ADMIT A CANDLE TO BURN IN IT IN ORDER TO TRY THIS EXPERIMENT I HALF EXHAUSTED A RECEIVER AND THEN WITH A BURNING GLASS FIRED THE GUNPOWDER WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY PUT INTO IT
3977-87547-0032 BY THIS MEANS I COULD FIRE A GREATER QUANTITY OF GUNPOWDER IN A SMALL QUANTITY OF AIR AND AVOID THE HAZARD OF BLOWING UP AND BREAKING MY RECEIVER I OWN THAT I WAS RATHER AFRAID OF FIRING GUNPOWDER IN INFLAMMABLE AIR
3977-87547-0033 BUT THERE WAS NO REASON FOR MY FEAR FOR IT EXPLODED QUITE FREELY IN THIS AIR LEAVING IT IN ALL RESPECTS JUST AS IT WAS BEFORE IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS EXPERIMENT AND INDEED ALMOST ALL THE EXPERIMENTS OF FIRING GUNPOWDER IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF AIR
3977-87547-0034 AND HAVING CAREFULLY EXHAUSTED IT BY A PUMP OF MISTER SMEATON'S CONSTRUCTION I FILLED THE RECEIVER WITH ANY KIND OF AIR
3977-87547-0035 IN THE EXPERIMENT WITH INFLAMMABLE AIR A CONSIDERABLE MIXTURE OF COMMON AIR WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY HAZARDOUS FOR BY THAT ASSISTANCE THE INFLAMMABLE AIR MIGHT HAVE EXPLODED IN SUCH A MANNER
3977-87547-0036 AS TO HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS TO THE OPERATOR INDEED I BELIEVE I SHOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO HAVE MADE THE EXPERIMENT AT ALL WITH ANY OTHER PUMP BESIDES MISTER SMEATON'S SOMETIMES I FILLED A GLASS VESSEL WITH QUICKSILVER
3977-87547-0037 AND INTRODUCED THE AIR TO IT WHEN IT WAS INVERTED IN A BASON OF QUICKSILVER BY THIS MEANS I INTIRELY AVOIDED ANY MIXTURE OF COMMON AIR BUT THEN IT WAS NOT EASY TO CONVEY THE GUNPOWDER INTO IT
3977-87547-0038 IN THE EXACT QUANTITY THAT WAS REQUISITE FOR MY PURPOSE THIS HOWEVER WAS THE ONLY METHOD BY WHICH I COULD CONTRIVE TO FIRE GUNPOWDER IN ACID OR ALKALINE AIR IN WHICH IT EXPLODED
3977-87547-0039 I BURNED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF GUNPOWDER IN AN EXHAUSTED RECEIVER
