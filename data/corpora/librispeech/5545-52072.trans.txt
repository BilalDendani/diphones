5545-52072-0000 UNDOUBTEDLY SHARED THE PONDEROUSNESS OF ALL DUTCH WORKMANSHIP WEIGHT IS REQUIRED ONLY WHEN CRASHING THROUGH A BUSHY COUNTRY WHERE A WAGON MUST BREAK DOWN ALL BEFORE IT IN EVERY OTHER CASE IT IS OBJECTIONABLE
5545-52072-0001 IT IS A SAVING OF LABOUR TO HAVE ONE LARGE WAGON RATHER THAN TWO SMALL ONES BECAUSE A DRIVER AND A LEADER ARE THEREBY SPARED BUT IF A VERY LIGHT WAGON HAS TO BE TAKEN I SHOULD GREATLY PREFER ITS BEING MADE ON THE SWISS AND GERMAN FASHION
5545-52072-0002 THE POLE AND THE FORE WHEELS FORMING ONE AND THE PERCH AND THE HIND WHEELS ANOTHER NOW SHOULD A GREAT LOSS OCCUR AMONG THE TRAVELLER'S CATTLE OR SHOULD HE BREAK A WHEEL OR EVEN STRAIN AN AXLE TREE
5545-52072-0003 AND TO BUILD UP A CART FOR CARRYING ON THE REMAINDER
5545-52072-0004 AND THEY CAN MAKE IT ANY LENGTH THEY PLEASE IT IS OF SO SIMPLE A CONSTRUCTION THAT EVERY FARMER CAN REPAIR HIS OWN AND MAKE ANYTHING OF IT IF HE HAS A PERCH A POLE AND FOUR WHEELS THAT IS ENOUGH WITH A LITTLE INGENUITY
5545-52072-0005 THIS LATTER FORMS THE AXLETREE THE BODY OF THE DRAY IS BUILT WHERE THE TWO CROSS AND THE CATTLE ARE YOKED OR HARNESSED TO THE LONG END OF THE BAR WHICH ACTS AS A POLE TARRING WHEELS
5545-52072-0006 TAR IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IN A HOT COUNTRY TO MIX WITH THE GREASE
5545-52072-0007 GREASE ALONE MELTS AND RUNS AWAY LIKE WATER THE OBJECT OF THE TAR IS TO GIVE CONSISTENCY TO THE GREASE A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF TAR SUFFICES BUT WITHOUT ANY AT ALL A WAGON IS SOON BROUGHT TO A STANDSTILL
5545-52072-0008 TAR IS ALSO OF VERY GREAT USE IN HOT DRY COUNTRIES FOR DAUBING OVER THE WHEELS
5545-52072-0009 DURING EXTREME HEAT WHEN THE WOOD IS READY TO CRACK ALL THE PAINT SHOULD BE SCRAPED OFF IT AND THE TAR APPLIED PLENTIFULLY IT WILL SOAK IN DEEPLY AND PRESERVE THE WOOD IN EXCELLENT CONDITION
5545-52072-0010 SEE TAR TO MAKE IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO TAKE OFF THE WHEELS IN ORDER TO GREASE THE AXLES IT IS SUFFICIENT TO BORE AN AUGER HOLE RIGHT THROUGH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NAVE BETWEEN THE FEET OF TWO OF THE SPOKES
5545-52072-0011 AND TO KEEP A PLUG IN THE HOLE THEN WHEN YOU WANT TO TAR A WHEEL TURN IT TILL THE HOLE IS UPPERMOST TAKE THE PLUG OUT AND POUR IN THE TAR BREAKS AND DRAGS BREAKS
5545-52072-0012 EVERY CART AND WAGON IN SWITZERLAND AND INDEED IN MOST PARTS OF THE CONTINENT
5545-52072-0013 THE SIMPLEST KIND OF BREAK IS SHOWN IN FIG TWO WHICH REPRESENTS A CART TILTED UPWARDS FIG ONE SHOWS THE BREAK ITSELF FIG TWO EXPLAINS HOW IT IS FITTED ON TO THE CART FIG ONE
5545-52072-0014 IS SHOWN IN FIG THREE A RAIL IS LASHED TO THE BODY OF THE CART BOTH BEFORE AND BEHIND THE WHEEL AND IS MADE TO PRESS AGAINST THE WHEEL EITHER BOTH LASHINGS CAN BE TIGHTENED AT THE SAME TIME AS AT A A OR
5545-52072-0015 IN GOING DOWN A STEEP HILL A MIDDLING SIZED TREE MAY BE FELLED AND ITS ROOT TIED TO THE HIND AXLETREE
5545-52072-0016 TOP SWEEPS ALONG THE GROUND AS IS SEEN IN THE LOWERMOST WAGON IN THE SKETCH SKETCH OF HORSES AND WAGONS ON HILL IN THE SOUTH WEST OF FRANCE THE LEADERS OF THE TEAM ARE UNHARNESSED AND TAKEN TO THE BACK OF THE WAGON
5545-52072-0017 AND FASTEN A ROPE ROUND THE AXLE OF THE WAGON THEN PASSING THE OTHER END ROUND A TREE OR ROCK AS A CHECK YOU MAY LET HER SLIDE WHICH SHE WILL DO WITHOUT ANY FURTHER TROUBLE ON YOUR PART
5545-52072-0018 THAT THE WAGON SETTLES DOWN INTO A MORE HORIZONTAL POSITION THAN BEFORE I HAVE SEEN TIMBER CARRIED ON A WAGON DOWN A STEEP HILL BY SEPARATING THE FRONT WHEELS FROM THE HIND ONES LASHING A TRAIL
5545-52072-0019 SEE TRAVAIL BELOW OR TWO SHORT POLES TO THE FORE AXLETREE AND RESTING ONE END OF THE TIMBER ON THE HIND AXLETREE AND THE OTHER END ON THE TRAIL SHOE THE WHEEL ON THE SIDE FURTHEST FROM THE PRECIPICE
5545-52072-0020 A LITTLE WITH AN AXE IF NECESSARY A FEW BARS MAY BE FIXED ACROSS THE FORK SO AS TO MAKE A STAGE GREAT DISTANCES MAY BE TRAVERSED BY ONE OF THESE RUDE AFFAIRS IF THE COUNTRY IS NOT VERY STONY
5545-52072-0021 SHOULD IT CAPSIZE NO GREAT HARM IS DONE AND IF IT BREAKS DOWN OR IS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN BADLY MADE AN HOUR'S LABOUR WILL SUFFICE TO CONSTRUCT ANOTHER
5545-52072-0022 BUT NO WAGON OR PACKING GEAR NORTH AMERICAN TRAVAIL IN A NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN HORSE TRAVAIL THE CROSSING OF THE POLES THEY ARE THE POLES OF THE WIGWAMS
5545-52072-0023 USUALLY RESTS ON A ROUGH PACK SADDLE OR PAD WHICH A BREAST STRAP KEEPS FROM SLIPPING BACKWARDS IN A DOG TRAVAIL THE CROSS OF THE POLES
5545-52072-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH INCONVENIENCE THINGS MAY BE QUICKLY THROWN INTO THEM OR TAKEN OUT POCKETS AND DRAWERS MAY BE FITTED UP
5545-52072-0025 WOULD AFFORD SOME SHELTER IN RAIN
