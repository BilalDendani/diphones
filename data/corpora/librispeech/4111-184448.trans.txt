4111-184448-0000 BUT THIS TORTURE BOOK FOUND THAT OUT ABOUT ME AND STOPPED IT THE VERY FIRST THING ON PAGE THREE THE COMMAND IS TO SLEEP AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE NERVES IN A GOOD CONDITION
4111-184448-0001 EIGHT HOURS AT THE MOST AND SEVEN WOULD BE BETTER WHAT EARTHLY GOOD WOULD A SEVEN HOUR NAP DO ME I WANT TEN HOURS TO SLEEP AND TWELVE IF I GET A GOOD TIRED START
4111-184448-0002 TO SEE ME STAGGER OUT OF MY PERFECTLY NICE BED AT SIX O'CLOCK EVERY MORNING NOW WOULD WRING THE STERNEST HEART WITH COMPASSION AND ADMIRATION AT MY FAITHFULNESS TO WHOM YES IT WAS THE DAY AFTER POOR MISTER CARTER'S FUNERAL
4111-184448-0003 THAT AUNT ADELINE MOVED UP HERE INTO MY HOUSE AND SETTLED HERSELF IN THE BIG SOUTH ROOM ACROSS THE LANDING FROM MINE HER FURNITURE WEIGHS A TON EACH PIECE AND AUNT ADELINE IS NOT LIGHT HERSELF IN DISPOSITION
4111-184448-0004 VACANT CHAIR IN A WAY THAT MADE ME SEE THAT SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO FILL THE VACANCY I AM SORRY SHE WORRIED HERSELF ABOUT THAT ANYHOW IT MADE ME TAKE A RESOLVE AFTER BREAKFAST I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO SPEAK TO JANE
4111-184448-0005 JANE I SAID LOOKING PAST HER HEAD MY HEALTH IS NOT VERY GOOD AND YOU CAN BRING MY BREAKFAST TO ME IN BED AFTER THIS POOR MISTER CARTER ALWAYS WANTED BREAKFAST ON THE STROKE OF SEVEN JANE HAS BURIED HUSBANDS
4111-184448-0006 ALSO HER MOTHER IS OUR WASHERWOMAN AND INFLUENCED BY AUNT ADELINE JANE UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING I SAY TO HER AFTER I HAD CLOSED THE DOOR I HEARD A LAUGH THAT SOUNDED LIKE A WAR WHOOP AND I SMILED TO MYSELF
4111-184448-0007 BUT THAT WAS BEFORE MY MARTYRDOM TO THIS BOOK HAD BEGUN I GET UP NOW BUT THE DAY AFTER I CAME FROM LONDON I LAY IN BED JUST AS LONG AS I WANTED TO
4111-184448-0008 AND IGNORED THE THOUGHT OF THE EXERCISES AND DEEP BREATHING AND THE ICY UNSYMPATHETIC TUB I COULDN'T EVEN TAKE VERY MUCH INTEREST IN THE LONELY EGG ON THE LONELY SLICE OF DRY TOAST I WAS THINKING ABOUT THINGS
4111-184448-0009 HILLSBORO IS A VERY PECULIAR LITTLE SPECK ON THE UNIVERSE
4111-184448-0010 IT HASN'T HAD ANY REAL EXCITEMENT FOR A LONG TIME AND I FELT THAT IT NEEDED IT I ROLLED OVER AND LAUGHED INTO MY PILLOW THE SUBJECT OF THE CONDUCT OF WIDOWS IS A SERIOUS ONE OF ALL THE THINGS
4111-184448-0011 OLD TRADITION IS MOST SET ABOUT IT IS THAT AND WHAT WAS DECIDED TO BE THE PROPER THING A MILLION YEARS AGO THIS TOWN STILL DICTATES SHALL BE DONE AND SPENDS A GOOD DEAL OF ITS TIME SEEING ITS DIRECTIONS CARRIED OUT
4111-184448-0012 THEN SOONER OR LATER SOME NEIGHBOUR IS SURE TO SEE SOME MAN WALK HOME FROM CHURCH WITH HER OR HEAR SOME MASCULINE VOICE IN HER FRONT GARDEN MISTER BLAKE GAVE MISSUS CARUTHER'S LITTLE JESSIE A RIDE IN HIS TRAP
4111-184448-0013 AND HELPED HER OUT AT HER MOTHER'S GATE JUST BEFORE LAST CHRISTMAS AND IF THE POOR WIDOW HADN'T ACTED QUICKLY THE TOWN WOULD HAVE NOTICED THEM TO DEATH BEFORE HE PROPOSED TO HER THEY WERE MARRIED THE DAY AFTER NEW YEAR'S DAY
4111-184448-0014 AND SHE LOST LOTS OF GOOD FRIENDS BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT I DON'T INTEND TO RUN ANY RISK OF LOSING MY FRIENDS THAT WAY AND I WANT THEM TO HAVE ALL THE ENJOYMENT THEY CAN GET OUT OF IT
4111-184448-0015 I'M GOING TO SERVE OUT DOSES OF EXCITEMENT UNTIL THE DEAR OLD PLACE IS RUNNING AS IT DID WHEN IT WAS A TWO YEAR OLD WHY GET ANNOYED WHEN PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN YOU IT'S A COMPLIMENT AFTER ALL AND GIVES THEM MORE TO THINK ABOUT I REMEMBERED THE
4111-184448-0016 AND HUGGED MY KNEES UP UNDER MY CHIN WITH PLEASURE AT THE THOUGHT OF THE TOWN TALK THEY CONTAINED
4111-184448-0017 OR THE WHITE CHIFFON WITH THE ROSEBUD EMBROIDERY AS A FIRST DOSE FOR MY FRIENDS A SWEETNESS CAME IN THROUGH MY WINDOW THAT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY AND I LAY STILL WITH MY HAND OVER MY HEART AND LISTENED
4111-184448-0018 IT WAS BILLY SINGING RIGHT UNDER MY WINDOW AND I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM DO IT BEFORE IN ALL HIS FIVE YEARS IT WAS THE DEAREST OLD FASHIONED TUNE EVER WRITTEN
4111-184448-0019 MY HEART BEAT SO IT SHOOK THE LACE ON MY BREAST LIKE A BREEZE FROM HEAVEN AS HE TOOK THE HIGH NOTE AND THEN LET IT GO ON THE LAST FEW WORDS
4111-184448-0020 A CONFUSED RECOLLECTION OF HAVING HEARD THE WORDS AND TUNE SUNG BY MY MOTHER WHEN I WAS AT THE ROCKING AGE MYSELF BROUGHT THE TEARS TO MY EYES AS I FLEW TO THE WINDOW AND PARTED THE CURTAINS
4111-184448-0021 IF YOU HEARD A LITTLE BOY ANGEL SINGING AT YOUR CASEMENT WOULDN'T YOU EXPECT A CHERUB FACE UPTURNED WITH HEAVEN LIGHTS ALL OVER IT BILLY'S FACE WAS UPTURNED AS HE HEARD ME DRAW UP THE BLIND
4111-184448-0022 BUT IT WAS STREAKED LIKE A WILD INDIAN'S WITH DECORATIONS OF BROWN MUD AND HE HELD A SLIMY FROG IN ONE HAND WHILE HE WIPED HIS OTHER GRIMY HAND DOWN THE FRONT OF HIS LINEN BLOUSE I SAY MOLLY LOOK AT THE FROG I BRINGED YOU
4111-184448-0023 HE EXCLAIMED AS HE CAME CLOSE UNDER THE SILL WHICH IS NOT HIGH FROM THE GROUND IF YOU PUT YOUR FACE DOWN TO THE MUD AND SING SOMETHING TO EM THEY'LL COME OUT OF THEIR HOLES A BEETLE COMED TOO BUT I COULDN'T KETCH EM BOTH LIFT ME UP AND I CAN PUT HIM IN THE WATERGLASS ON YOUR TABLE
4111-184448-0024 HE HELD UP ONE MUDDY HAND TO ME AND PROMPTLY I LIFTED HIM UP INTO MY ARMS
4111-184448-0025 HE BEGAN TO SQUIRM OUT OF MY ARMS TOWARD THE TABLE AND THE GLASS WHO TAUGHT IT TO YOU SUGAR SWEET I PERSISTED AS I POURED WATER IN ON THE FROG UNDER HIS DIRECTION
4111-184448-0026 FATHER SINGS IT TO ME WHEN TILLY NURSE NOR YOU AREN'T THERE TO PUT ME TO BED HE DON'T KNOW NO GOOD SONGS LIKE BLACK EYED SUSAN OR LITTLE BOY BLUE
4111-184448-0027 AS SOON AS HE GOT IT HE CLIMBED OUT OF THE WINDOW GLASS FROG AND ALL
4111-184448-0028 I CLOSED THE BLINDS AND DREW THE CURTAINS AGAIN AND FLUNG MYSELF ON MY PILLOW SOMETHING WARM AND SWEET SEEMED TO BE SWEEPING OVER ME IN GREAT WAVES AND I FELT YOUNG AND CLOSE UP TO SOME SORT OF BIG WORLD GOOD
4111-184448-0029 IT WAS DELICIOUS AND I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I WOULD HAVE STAYED THERE JUST FEELING IT IF JANE HADN'T BROUGHT IN MY LETTER HE HAD WRITTEN FROM LONDON AND IT WAS MANY PAGES OF WONDERFUL THINGS ALL FLAVOURED WITH ME
4111-184448-0030 AND HOW MUCH HE HOPED SHE WOULD BE IN HILLSBORO WHEN HE GOT HERE HE SAID THAT A GREAT MANY OF HER DAINTY WAYS REMINDED HIM OF HIS OWN SLIP OF A GIRL ESPECIALLY THE TURN OF HER HEAD LIKE A FLOWER ON ITS STEM
4111-184448-0031 AT THAT I GOT RIGHT OUT OF BED LIKE A JACK JUMPING OUT OF A BOX AND LOOKED AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR THERE IS ONE EXERCISE HERE ON PAGE TWENTY THAT I HATE WORST OF ALL YOU SCREW UP YOUR FACE TIGHT UNTIL YOU LOOK LIKE A CHRISTMAS MASK
4111-184448-0032 AND THEN WOBBLE YOUR HEAD ROUND LIKE A NEW BORN BABY UNTIL IT SWIMS I DID THAT ONE TWENTY EXTRA TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS IN PROPORTION TO MAKE UP FOR THOSE TWO HOURS IN BED HEREAFTER I'LL GET UP AT THE TIME DIRECTED ON PAGE THREE OR MAYBE EARLIER
4111-184448-0033 I WON'T LET MYSELF EVEN THINK PERFECT FLOWER AND SCARLET RUNNER IF I DO I GET WARM AND HAPPY ALL OVER I TRY WHEN I GET HUNGRY TO THINK OF MYSELF IN THAT BLUE MUSLIN DRESS
4111-184448-0034 AND WHAT MADAME RENE DID TO IT REMADE IT INTO THE LOVELIEST THING I EVER SAW ONLY I WOULDN'T LET HER ALTER THE SIZE ONE SINGLE INCH I'M HONOURABLE AS ALL WOMEN ARE AT PECULIAR TIMES I THINK SHE UNDERSTOOD
4111-184448-0035 BUT SHE SEEMED NOT TO AND WORKED A MIRACLE ON IT WITH RIBBON AND LACE I'VE PUT IT AWAY ON THE TOP SHELF OF A CUPBOARD FOR IT IS A TORMENT TO LOOK AT IT YOU CAN JUST TAKE ANY RECIPE FOR A PARTY AND IT WILL MAKE A GOOD DEBUT FOR A GIRL
4111-184448-0036 AS QUIETLY AS MY CLOTHES WOULD LET ME WHEN A REAL CONFLAGRATION WAS LIGHTED INSIDE ME IF TOM POLLARD WASN'T MY OWN FIRST COUSIN I WOULD HAVE LOVED HIM DESPERATELY EVEN IF I AM A WEEK OLDER THAN HE
4111-184448-0037 HE WAS ABOUT THE ONLY OASIS IN MY CHILDHOOD'S DAYS THOUGH I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD THINK OF CALLING HIM AT ALL GREEN HE NEVER STOPPED COMING TO SEE ME OCCASIONALLY AND MISTER CARTER LIKED HIM
4111-184448-0038 AND WHEN THAT CONFLAGRATION WAS LIGHTED IN ME ABOUT MY DEBUT TOM DID IT I WAS SITTING PEACEABLY IN MY OWN SUMMER HOUSE DRESSED IN THE SUMMER BEFORE LAST THAT JANE WASHES AND IRONS EVERY DAY WHILE I AM DECIDING HOW TO HAND OUT THE FIRST SIP OF MY TROUSSEAU TO THE NEIGHBOURS
4111-184448-0039 WHEN TOM IN A DANGEROUS BLUE STRIPED SHIRT WITH A TIE THAT MELTED INTO IT IN TONE JUMPED OVER MY FENCE AND LANDED AT MY SIDE HE KISSED THE LACE RUFFLE ON MY SLEEVE WHILE I REPROVED HIM SEVERELY AND SETTLED DOWN TO ENJOY HIM
4111-184448-0040 BUT I DIDN'T HAVE SUCH A GOOD TIME AS I GENERALLY DO WITH HIM HE WAS TOO FULL OF ANOTHER WOMAN AND EVEN A FIRST COUSIN CAN BE AN EXASPERATION IN THAT CONDITION
