5655-46268-0000 CHAPTER FOUR A FIRE AND A PLAN SOME PEOPLE SAID THAT OLD JOHANN HEINRICH NEVER SLEPT FOR NO MATTER WHAT HOUR OF THE NIGHT ONE PASSED HIS LONELY LITTLE HOUSE A LAMP WAS ALWAYS BURNING
5655-46268-0001 HE WAS A QUEER OLD GERMAN NATURALIST LIVING BY HIMSELF IN A COTTAGE ADJOINING THE MAC INTYRE PLACE HE HAD BEEN A PROFESSOR IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY UNTIL HE GREW TOO OLD TO KEEP HIS POSITION
5655-46268-0002 THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TWO BIG BOOKS ABOUT THE BIRDS AND INSECTS HE LOVED SO WELL OR THAT HE COULD TELL THEM FACTS MORE WONDERFUL THAN FAIRY TALES ABOUT THESE LITTLE WILD CREATURES OF THE WOODLAND TO NIGHT HE HAD READ LATER THAN USUAL
5655-46268-0003 WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE VALLEY WAS SOUND ASLEEP OVER IN THE CABIN BY THE SPRING HOUSE WHERE THE BOYS HAD LEFT THE TRAMP AND JONESY A PUFF OF SMOKE WENT CURLING AROUND THE ROOF THEN A TONGUE OF FLAME SHOT UP THROUGH THE CEDARS
5655-46268-0004 IT SHONE FULL ACROSS THE WINDOW OF VIRGINIA'S ROOM BUT SHE WAS DREAMING OF BEING CHASED BY BEARS AND ONLY TURNED UNEASILY IN HER SLEEP THE OLD PROFESSOR ON HIS WAY TO THE KITCHEN NOTICED THAT IT SEEMED STRANGELY LIGHT OUTSIDE
5655-46268-0005 SOMEBODY VILL SHUST IN HIS BED BE BURNT IF OLD JOHANN DOES NOT HASTE MAKE NOT WAITING TO CLOSE THE DOOR BEHIND HIM OR EVEN TO CATCH UP SOMETHING TO PROTECT HIS OLD BALD HEAD FROM THE INTENSE COLD OF THE WINTER NIGHT
5655-46268-0006 HE RAN OUT ACROSS THE GARDEN HIS SHUFFLING FEET IN THEIR FLAPPING OLD CARPET SLIPPERS FORGOT THEIR RHEUMATISM AND HIS SHOULDERS DROPPED THE WEIGHT OF THEIR SEVENTY YEARS HE RAN LIKE A BOY ACROSS THE MEADOW
5655-46268-0007 THROUGH THE GAP IN THE FENCE AND DOWN THE HILL TO THE CABIN BY THE SPRING ALL ONE SIDE OF IT WAS IN FLAMES THE FIRE WAS CURLING AROUND THE FRONT DOOR AND BURSTING THROUGH THE WINDOWS WITH FIERCE CRACKLINGS
5655-46268-0008 BUT SOMETHING FELL ACROSS THE DOOR SILL IN A LIMP LITTLE HEAP IT WAS JONESY DRAGGING THE CHILD TO A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE BURNING BUILDING HE RAN BACK FEARING THAT SOME ONE ELSE MIGHT BE IN DANGER
5655-46268-0009 AND ALL DANGER OF THE FIRE SPREADING TO OTHER BUILDINGS WAS OVER WHILE THE PROFESSOR WAS BENDING OVER JONESY TRYING TO BRING HIM BACK TO CONSCIOUSNESS MISS ALLISON CAME RUNNING DOWN THE PATH
5655-46268-0010 THE SHOUTS HAD AWAKENED HER ALSO AND SHE HAD SLIPPED OUT AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE NOT WISHING TO ALARM HER MOTHER HOW DID IT HAPPEN SHE DEMANDED BREATHLESSLY IS THE CHILD BADLY BURNED IS ANY ONE ELSE HURT IS THE TRAMP IN THE CABIN
5655-46268-0011 NO ONE GAVE ANY ANSWER TO HER RAPID QUESTIONS THE OLD PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT DID NOT LOOK UP HE WAS BENDING OVER JONESY TRYING TO RESTORE HIM TO CONSCIOUSNESS HE SEEMED TO KNOW THE RIGHT THINGS TO DO FOR HIM
5655-46268-0012 AND LOOKED AROUND WONDERINGLY IN A FEW MINUTES HE WAS ABLE TO TELL WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE FIRE IT WAS NOT MUCH ONLY A HORRIBLE RECOLLECTION OF BEING AWAKENED BY A FEELING THAT HE WAS CHOKING IN THE THICK SMOKE THAT FILLED THE ROOM
5655-46268-0013 OF HEARING THE BOSS SWEAR AT HIM TO BE QUICK AND FOLLOW HIM OR HE WOULD BE BURNED TO DEATH THEN THERE HAD BEEN AN AWFUL MOMENT OF GROPING THROUGH THE BLINDING CHOKING SMOKE TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT THE MAN SPRANG TO A WINDOW AND MADE HIS ESCAPE
5655-46268-0014 BUT AS THE OUTSIDE AIR RUSHED IN THROUGH THE OPENING HE LEFT IT SEEMED TO FAN THE SMOKE INSTANTLY INTO FLAME JONESY HAD STRUCK OUT AT THE WALL OF FIRE WITH HIS HELPLESS LITTLE HANDS AND THEN HALF CRAZED BY THE SCORCHING PAIN
5655-46268-0015 DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND CRAWLED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION JUST AS THE PROFESSOR BURST OPEN THE DOOR THE SIGHT OF THE POOR LITTLE BLISTERED FACE BROUGHT THE TEARS TO MISS ALLISON'S EYES AND SHE CALLED TWO OF THE COLOURED MEN
5655-46268-0016 DIRECTING THEM TO CARRY JONESY TO THE HOUSE AND THEN GO AT ONCE FOR A DOCTOR BUT THE PROFESSOR INTERFERED INSISTING THAT JONESY SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HIS HOUSE HE SAID THAT HE KNEW HOW TO PREPARE THE COOLING BANDAGES THAT WERE NEEDED
5655-46268-0017 AND THAT HE WOULD SIT UP ALL NIGHT TO APPLY THEM HE COULD NOT SLEEP ANYHOW HE SAID AFTER SUCH GREAT EXCITEMENT BUT I FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM URGED MISS ALLISON
5655-46268-0018 AND MY LITTLE NEPHEWS BROUGHT HIM HERE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF HIM THE PROFESSOR WAVED HER ASIDE LIFTING JONESY'S HEAD AS TENDERLY AS A NURSE COULD HAVE DONE AND MOTIONED THE COLOURED MEN TO LIFT HIM UP
5655-46268-0019 NO NO FRAULEIN HE SAID I HAVE HAD EGGSPERIENCE IT IS BESSER THE POOR LEEDLE KNABE GO MIT ME THERE WAS NO OPPOSING THE OLD MAN'S MASTERFUL WAY
5655-46268-0020 LEST SOME STRAY SPARK SHOULD BE BLOWN TOWARD THE OTHER BUILDINGS DIS YERE OLE NIGGAH WA'N'T MISTAKEN AFTAH ALL HE MUTTERED
5655-46268-0021 FOR FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW HE FOUND SOME TRACKS PRESENTLY AND FOLLOWED THEM OVER THE MEADOW IN THE STARLIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD AND DOWN THE RAILROAD TRACK SEVERAL RODS THERE THEY SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
5655-46268-0022 THE TRAMP HAD EVIDENTLY WALKED ON THE RAIL SOME DISTANCE IF UNC HENRY HAD GONE QUARTER OF A MILE FARTHER UP THE TRACK HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THOSE SAME SLIDING IMPRINTS
5655-46268-0023 IN HIS HASTE TO GET AWAY JONESY STOUTLY DENIED THAT THE MAN HAD SET FIRE TO THE CABIN WE NEARLY FROZE TO DEATH THAT NIGHT HE SAID WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT IT AFTERWARD AND THE BOSS PILED ON AN AWFUL BIG LOT OF WOOD JUST BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
5655-46268-0024 THEN WHAT MADE HIM TAKE TO HIS HEELS SO FAST IF HE DIDN'T SOME ONE ASKED I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED JONESY HE SAID THAT LUCK WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HIM AND MAYBE HE THOUGHT NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE HIM IF HE DID SAY THAT HE DIDN'T DO IT
5655-46268-0025 SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT MALCOLM FOUND THE TRAMP'S PICTURE IN THE COURIER JOURNAL HE WAS A NOTED CRIMINAL WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM A NORTHERN PENITENTIARY SOME TWO MONTHS BEFORE AND HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE LOUISVILLE POLICE
5655-46268-0026 THERE WAS NO MISTAKING HIM THAT BIG UGLY SCAR BRANDED HIM ON CHEEK AND FOREHEAD LIKE ANOTHER CAIN AND TO THINK THAT THAT TERRIBLE MAN WAS HARBOURED ON MY PLACE EXCLAIMED MISSUS MAC INTYRE WHEN SHE HEARD OF IT
5655-46268-0027 HE ISN'T A FIT COMPANION FOR YOU NOT THAT THE POOR LITTLE UNFORTUNATE IS TO BLAME HE CANNOT HELP BEING A CHILD OF THE SLUMS AND HE MUST BE PUT IN AN ORPHAN ASYLUM OR A REFORM SCHOOL AT ONCE
5655-46268-0028 IT IS PROBABLY THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SAVE HIM FROM GROWING UP TO BE A CRIMINAL LIKE THE MAN WHO BROUGHT HIM HERE I SHALL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A CHILD OF THE SLUMS MALCOLM AND KEITH REPEATED THE EXPRESSION AFTERWARD
5655-46268-0029 MAYBE IF JONESY HAD BEEN AN ATTRACTIVE CHILD WITH A SENSITIVE MOUTH AND BIG APPEALING EYES HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND HIS WAY MORE EASILY INTO PEOPLE'S HEARTS BUT HE WAS A LEAN SNUB NOSED LITTLE FELLOW
5655-46268-0030 WITH A FRECKLED FACE AND NEGLECTED HAIR NO ONE WOULD EVER FIND HIS CHEEK A TEMPTING ONE TO KISS AND NO ONE WOULD BE MOVED BY ANY FEELING SAVE PITY TO STOOP AND PUT AFFECTIONATE ARMS AROUND JONESY
5655-46268-0031 AS UNLOVELY AS HE WAS UNLOVED WHAT A BLESSING THAT THERE ARE SUCH PLACES AS ORPHAN ASYLUMS FOR CHILDREN OF THAT CLASS SAID MISSUS MACLNTYRE AFTER ONE OF HER VISITS TO HIM
5655-46268-0032 I MUST MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIM TO BE PUT INTO ONE AS SOON AS HE IS ABLE TO BE MOVED I THINK HE WILL BE VERY LOATH TO LEAVE THE OLD PROFESSOR ANSWERED MISS ALLISON HE HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO THE CHILD AMUSING HIM BY THE HOUR WITH HIS MICROSCOPES
5655-46268-0033 AND COLLECTIONS OF INSECTS TELLING HIM THOSE DELIGHTFUL OLD GERMAN FOLK LORE TALES AND PUTTING HIM TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT TO THE MUSIC OF HIS VIOLIN WHAT A CHILD LOVER HE IS AND WHAT A DELIGHTFUL OLD MAN IN EVERY WAY
5655-46268-0034 I AM GLAD WE HAVE DISCOVERED HIM YES SAID MISSUS MACLNTYRE AND WHEN THIS LITTLE TRAMP IS SENT AWAY I WANT THE CHILDREN TO GO THERE OFTEN I ASKED HIM IF HE COULD NOT TEACH THEM THIS SPRING AT LEAST MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THEM IN NATURAL HISTORY
5655-46268-0035 AND HE APPEARED MUCH PLEASED HE IS AS POOR AS A CHURCH MOUSE AND WOULD BE VERY GLAD OF THE MONEY THAT REMINDS ME SAID MISS ALLISON HE ASKED ME IF THE BOYS COULD NOT COME DOWN TO SEE JONESY THIS AFTERNOON AND BRING THE BEAR
5655-46268-0036 AND MIGHT HELP HIM TO FORGET HIS SUFFERING
