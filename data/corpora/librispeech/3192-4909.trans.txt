3192-4909-0000 DISPOSED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE DAY BEFORE EVEN MISTER MAURICE FRERE RECOVERED FROM HIS MIDNIGHT FATIGUES WAS LOUNGING ON THE SAME COIL OF ROPE IN PRECISELY THE SAME POSITION YET THE EYE OF AN ACUTE OBSERVER
3192-4909-0001 WOULD HAVE DETECTED SOME DIFFERENCE BENEATH THIS OUTWARD VARNISH OF SIMILARITY THE MAN AT THE WHEEL LOOKED ROUND THE HORIZON MORE EAGERLY AND SPIT INTO THE SWIRLING UNWHOLESOME LOOKING WATER WITH A MORE DEJECTED AIR THAN BEFORE
3192-4909-0002 THE FISHING LINES STILL HUNG DANGLING OVER THE CATHEADS BUT NOBODY TOUCHED THEM THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS ON THE FORECASTLE COLLECTED IN KNOTS HAD NO HEART EVEN TO SMOKE BUT GLOOMILY STARED AT EACH OTHER VICKERS WAS IN THE CUDDY
3192-4909-0003 WRITING BLUNT WAS IN HIS CABIN AND PINE WITH TWO CARPENTERS AT WORK UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS WAS IMPROVISING INCREASED HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION THE NOISE OF MALLET AND HAMMER ECHOED IN THE SOLDIERS BERTH OMINOUSLY
3192-4909-0004 THE WORKMEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN MAKING COFFINS THE PRISON WAS STRANGELY SILENT WITH THE LOWERING SILENCE WHICH PRECEDES A THUNDERSTORM AND THE CONVICTS ON DECK NO LONGER TOLD STORIES NOR LAUGHED AT OBSCENE JESTS BUT SAT TOGETHER
3192-4909-0005 MOODILY PATIENT AS IF WAITING FOR SOMETHING THREE MEN TWO PRISONERS AND A SOLDIER HAD SUCCUMBED SINCE RUFUS DAWES HAD BEEN REMOVED TO THE HOSPITAL AND THOUGH AS YET
3192-4909-0006 OR SYMPTOM OF PANIC THE FACE OF EACH MAN SOLDIER SAILOR OR PRISONER WORE AN EXPECTANT LOOK AS THOUGH HE WONDERED WHOSE TURN WOULD COME NEXT ON THE SHIP ROLLING CEASELESSLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
3192-4909-0007 LIKE SOME WOUNDED CREATURE ON THE OPAQUE PROFUNDITY OF THAT STAGNANT OCEAN A HORRIBLE SHADOW HAD FALLEN THE MALABAR SEEMED TO BE ENVELOPED IN AN ELECTRIC CLOUD WHOSE SULLEN GLOOM A CHANCE SPARK MIGHT FLASH INTO A BLAZE THAT SHOULD CONSUME HER
3192-4909-0008 THE WOMAN WHO HELD IN HER HANDS THE TWO ENDS OF THE CHAIN THAT WOULD PRODUCE THIS SPARK PAUSED CAME UP UPON DECK AND AFTER A GLANCE ROUND LEANT AGAINST THE POOP RAILING AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE BARRICADE
3192-4909-0009 AND TO ONE GROUP IN PARTICULAR HER GLANCE WAS DIRECTED THREE MEN LEANING CARELESSLY AGAINST THE BULWARKS WATCHED HER EVERY MOTION THERE SHE IS RIGHT ENOUGH GROWLED MISTER GABBETT AS IF IN CONTINUATION OF A PREVIOUS REMARK
3192-4909-0010 PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE MOST NOBLE KNUCKLER SAYS THE CROW WITH AFFECTED CARELESSNESS GIVE THE YOUNG WOMAN TIME
3192-4909-0011 SAYS THE GIANT LICKING HIS COARSE BLUE LIPS
3192-4909-0012 AND KEP DANCIN ROUND THE DANDY'S WENCH LIKE A PARCEL O DOGS THE FEVER'S ABOARD AND WE'VE GOT ALL READY WHAT'S THE USE O WAITIN
3192-4909-0013 I'M FOR BIZNESS AT ONCE THERE LOOK AT THAT HE ADDED WITH AN OATH AS THE FIGURE OF MAURICE FRERE APPEARED SIDE BY SIDE WITH THAT OF THE WAITING MAID AND THE TWO TURNED AWAY UP THE DECK TOGETHER IT'S ALL RIGHT YOU CONFOUNDED MUDDLEHEAD CRIED THE CROW
3192-4909-0014 LOSING PATIENCE WITH HIS PERVERSE AND STUPID COMPANION HOW CAN SHE GIVE US THE OFFICE WITH THAT COVE AT HER ELBOW GABBETT'S ONLY REPLY TO THIS QUESTION WAS A FEROCIOUS GRUNT AND A SUDDEN ELEVATION OF HIS CLENCHED FIST WHICH CAUSED MISTER VETCH TO RETREAT PRECIPITATELY
3192-4909-0015 THE GIANT DID NOT FOLLOW AND MISTER VETCH FOLDING HIS ARMS AND ASSUMING AN ATTITUDE OF EASY CONTEMPT DIRECTED HIS ATTENTION TO SARAH PURFOY SHE SEEMED AN OBJECT OF GENERAL ATTRACTION
3192-4909-0016 FOR AT THE SAME MOMENT A YOUNG SOLDIER RAN UP THE LADDER TO THE FORECASTLE AND EAGERLY BENT HIS GAZE IN HER DIRECTION MAURICE FRERE HAD COME BEHIND HER AND TOUCHED HER ON THE SHOULDER
3192-4909-0017 THE GIRL WAS EVIDENTLY PLAYING WITH HIM AND HE WOULD SHOW HER THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH WELL SARAH WELL MISTER FRERE DROPPING HER HAND AND TURNING ROUND WITH A SMILE HOW WELL YOU ARE LOOKING TO DAY POSITIVELY LOVELY
3192-4909-0018 YOU HAVE TOLD ME THAT SO OFTEN SAYS SHE WITH A POUT HAVE YOU NOTHING ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT THAT I LOVE YOU THIS IN A MOST IMPASSIONED MANNER THAT IS NO NEWS I KNOW YOU DO CURSE IT SARAH WHAT IS A FELLOW TO DO HIS PROFLIGACY WAS FAILING HIM RAPIDLY
3192-4909-0019 FELLOW SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF MISTER FRERE I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ME DID I IF YOU DON'T PLEASE ME IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT PERHAPS WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU SOLDIERS HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO THINK OF YOUR GUARDS AND SENTRIES AND VISITS AND THINGS
3192-4909-0020 SHE CAST HER EYES DOWN TO THE DECK AND A MODEST FLUSH ROSE IN HER CHEEKS I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO SHE SAID IN A HALF WHISPER THERE ARE SO MANY EYES UPON ME
3192-4909-0021 AND TO GIVE EFFECT TO HER WORDS LOOKED ROUND THE DECK HER GLANCE CROSSED THAT OF THE YOUNG SOLDIER ON THE FORECASTLE
3192-4909-0022 MILES WAS JEALOUS FRERE SMILING WITH DELIGHT AT HER CHANGE OF MANNER CAME CLOSE TO HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR
3192-4909-0023 I WILL COME AT EIGHT O'CLOCK SAID SHE WITH MODESTLY AVERTED FACE THEY RELIEVE THE GUARD AT EIGHT HE SAID DEPRECATINGLY SHE TOSSED HER HEAD VERY WELL THEN
3192-4909-0024 I DON'T CARE BUT SARAH CONSIDER AS IF A WOMAN IN LOVE EVER CONSIDERS SAID SHE TURNING UPON HIM A BURNING GLANCE WHICH IN TRUTH MIGHT HAVE MELTED A MORE ICY MAN THAN HE SHE LOVED HIM THEN WHAT A FOOL HE WOULD BE TO REFUSE
3192-4909-0025 TO GET HER TO COME WAS THE FIRST OBJECT HOW TO MAKE DUTY FIT WITH PLEASURE WOULD BE CONSIDERED AFTERWARDS BESIDES THE GUARD COULD RELIEVE ITSELF FOR ONCE WITHOUT HIS SUPERVISION VERY WELL AT EIGHT THEN DEAREST
3192-4909-0026 AND AS FRERE LEFT HER SHE TURNED AND WITH HER EYES FIXED ON THE CONVICT BARRICADE DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE HELD IN HER HAND OVER THE POOP RAILING IT FELL AT THE FEET OF THE AMOROUS CAPTAIN
3192-4909-0027 AND WITH A QUICK UPWARD GLANCE THAT WORTHY FELLOW PICKED IT UP AND BROUGHT IT TO HER OH THANK YOU CAPTAIN BLUNT
3192-4909-0028 DID YOU TAKE THE LAUDANUM WHISPERED BLUNT WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE SOME OF IT SAID SHE I WILL BRING YOU BACK THE BOTTLE TO NIGHT BLUNT WALKED AFT HUMMING CHEERILY AND SALUTED FRERE WITH A SLAP ON THE BACK THE TWO MEN LAUGHED EACH AT HIS OWN THOUGHTS
3192-4909-0029 BUT THEIR LAUGHTER ONLY MADE THE SURROUNDING GLOOM SEEM DEEPER THAN BEFORE SARAH PURFOY CASTING HER EYES TOWARD THE BARRICADE
3192-4909-0030 THEY WERE TOGETHER ONCE MORE AND THE CROW HAVING TAKEN OFF HIS PRISON CAP HELD IT AT ARM'S LENGTH WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE WIPED HIS BROW WITH THE OTHER HER SIGNAL HAD BEEN OBSERVED DURING ALL THIS RUFUS DAWES
3192-4909-0031 WAS LYING FLAT ON HIS BACK STARING AT THE DECK ABOVE HIM TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING HE WANTED TO SAY
3192-4909-0032 HE COULD GIVE SUCH INFORMATION AS WOULD AVERT THAT DANGER AND SAVE THE SHIP BUT
3192-4909-0033 HE WAS AS ONE POSSESSED HE COULD MOVE NOR HAND NOR FOOT THE PLACE WHERE HE LAY WAS BUT DIMLY LIGHTED THE INGENUITY OF PINE HAD CONSTRUCTED A CANVAS BLIND
3192-4909-0034 AND THIS BLIND ABSORBED MUCH OF THE LIGHT HE COULD BUT JUST SEE THE DECK ABOVE HIS HEAD AND DISTINGUISH THE OUTLINES OF THREE OTHER BERTHS APPARENTLY SIMILAR TO HIS OWN THE ONLY SOUNDS THAT BROKE THE SILENCE WERE THE GURGLING OF THE WATER BELOW HIM
3192-4909-0035 AND THE TAP TAP TAP TAP OF PINE'S HAMMERS AT WORK UPON THE NEW PARTITION BY AND BY
3192-4909-0036 COULD HEAR GASPS AND MOANS AND MUTTERINGS

3192-4909-0043 HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS HANGING OVER THE BRINK OF DELIRIUM AND THAT UNLESS HE MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD BEFORE HIS SENSES UTTERLY DESERTED HIM ALL WAS LOST
3192-4909-0044 HE MADE AN EFFORT TO SPEAK BUT HIS TONGUE CLOVE TO THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH AND HIS JAWS STUCK TOGETHER HE COULD NOT RAISE A FINGER NOR UTTER A SOUND THE BOARDS OVER HIS HEAD WAVED LIKE A SHAKEN SHEET AND THE CABIN WHIRLED ROUND
3192-4909-0045 HE CLOSED HIS EYES WITH A TERRIBLE SIGH OF DESPAIR AND RESIGNED HIMSELF TO HIS FATE AT THAT INSTANT THE SOUND OF HAMMERING CEASED AND THE DOOR OPENED IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK AND PINE HAD COME TO HAVE A LAST LOOK AT HIS PATIENTS BEFORE DINNER
3192-4909-0046 IT SEEMED THAT THERE WAS SOMEBODY WITH HIM FOR A KIND THOUGH SOMEWHAT POMPOUS VOICE REMARKED UPON THE SCANTINESS OF ACCOMMODATION AND THE NECESSITY THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF COMPLYING WITH THE KING'S REGULATIONS
