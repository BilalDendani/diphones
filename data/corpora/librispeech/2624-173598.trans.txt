2624-173598-0000 THE PART ASSUMED BY FRANCE ON THE BORDERS OF THAT NEW WORLD WAS PECULIAR AND IS LITTLE RECOGNIZED WHILE THE SPANIARD ROAMED SEA AND LAND BURNING FOR ACHIEVEMENT RED HOT WITH BIGOTRY AND AVARICE
2624-173598-0001 AND WHILE ENGLAND WITH SOBERER STEPS AND A LESS DAZZLING RESULT FOLLOWED IN THE PATH OF DISCOVERY AND GOLD HUNTING IT WAS FROM FRANCE THAT THOSE BARBAROUS SHORES FIRST LEARNED TO SERVE THE ENDS OF PEACEFUL COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY
2624-173598-0002 A FRENCH WRITER HOWEVER ADVANCES A MORE AMBITIOUS CLAIM IN THE YEAR FOURTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS AMERICA HE MAINTAINS
2624-173598-0003 WAS FOUND BY FRENCHMEN COUSIN
2624-173598-0004 BEING AT SEA OFF THE AFRICAN COAST WAS FORCED WESTWARD IT IS SAID BY WINDS AND CURRENTS TO WITHIN SIGHT OF AN UNKNOWN SHORE WHERE HE PRESENTLY DESCRIED THE MOUTH OF A GREAT RIVER ON BOARD HIS SHIP WAS ONE PINZON WHOSE CONDUCT
2624-173598-0005 MADE COMPLAINT TO THE MAGISTRACY WHO THEREUPON DISMISSED THE OFFENDER FROM THE MARITIME SERVICE OF THE TOWN PINZON WENT TO SPAIN BECAME KNOWN TO COLUMBUS TOLD HIM THE DISCOVERY AND JOINED HIM ON HIS VOYAGE OF FOURTEEN NINETY TWO
2624-173598-0006 TO LEAVE THIS CLOUDLAND OF TRADITION AND APPROACH THE CONFINES OF RECORDED HISTORY THE NORMANS OFFSPRING OF AN ANCESTRY OF CONQUERORS
2624-173598-0007 THE BRETONS THAT STUBBORN HARDY UNCHANGING RACE WHO AMONG DRUID MONUMENTS CHANGELESS AS THEMSELVES STILL CLING WITH CELTIC OBSTINACY TO THE THOUGHTS AND HABITS OF THE PAST THE BASQUES THAT PRIMEVAL PEOPLE OLDER THAN HISTORY ALL FREQUENTED
2624-173598-0008 AND IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT IN FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN FIFTY CASTILIAN FRENCH AND PORTUGUESE VESSELS WERE ENGAGED IN IT AT ONCE WHILE IN FIFTEEN TWENTY SEVEN ON THE THIRD OF AUGUST ELEVEN SAIL OF NORMAN ONE OF BRETON
2624-173598-0009 AND TWO OF PORTUGUESE FISHERMEN WERE TO BE FOUND IN THE BAY OF SAINT JOHN FROM THIS TIME FORTH THE NEWFOUNDLAND FISHERY WAS NEVER ABANDONED FRENCH ENGLISH SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE MADE RESORT TO THE BANKS ALWAYS JEALOUS
2624-173598-0010 OFTEN QUARRELLING BUT STILL DRAWING UP TREASURE FROM THOSE EXHAUSTLESS MINES AND BEARING HOME BOUNTIFUL PROVISION AGAINST THE SEASON OF LENT ON THIS DIM VERGE OF THE KNOWN WORLD THERE WERE OTHER PERILS THAN THOSE OF THE WAVES
2624-173598-0011 THE ROCKS AND SHORES OF THOSE SEQUESTERED SEAS HAD SO THOUGHT THE VOYAGERS OTHER TENANTS THAN THE SEAL THE WALRUS AND THE SCREAMING SEA FOWL THE BEARS WHICH STOLE AWAY THEIR FISH BEFORE THEIR EYES AND THE WILD NATIVES DRESSED IN SEAL SKINS
2624-173598-0012 GRIFFIUS SO RAN THE STORY INFESTED THE MOUNTAINS OF LABRADOR TWO ISLANDS NORTH OF NEWFOUNDLAND WERE GIVEN OVER TO THE FIENDS FROM WHOM THEY DERIVED THEIR NAME THE ISLES OF DEMONS AN OLD MAP
2624-173598-0013 PICTURES THEIR OCCUPANTS AT LENGTH DEVILS RAMPANT WITH WINGS HORNS AND TAIL THE PASSING VOYAGER HEARD THE DIN OF THEIR INFERNAL ORGIES AND WOE TO THE SAILOR OR THE FISHERMAN WHO VENTURED ALONE INTO THE HAUNTED WOODS TRUE IT IS
2624-173598-0014 AND I MYSELF HAVE HEARD IT NOT FROM ONE BUT FROM A GREAT NUMBER OF THE SAILORS AND PILOTS WITH WHOM I HAVE MADE MANY VOYAGES THAT WHEN THEY PASSED THIS WAY THEY HEARD IN THE AIR
2624-173598-0015 ON THE TOPS AND ABOUT THE MASTS A GREAT CLAMOR OF MEN'S VOICES CONFUSED AND INARTICULATE SUCH AS YOU MAY HEAR FROM THE CROWD AT A FAIR OR MARKET PLACE WHEREUPON THEY WELL KNEW THAT THE ISLE OF DEMONS WAS NOT FAR OFF
2624-173598-0016 AND HE ADDS THAT HE HIMSELF WHEN AMONG THE INDIANS HAD SEEN THEM SO TORMENTED BY THESE INFERNAL PERSECUTORS THAT THEY WOULD FALL INTO HIS ARMS FOR RELIEF ON WHICH REPEATING A PASSAGE OF THE GOSPEL OF SAINT JOHN HE HAD DRIVEN THE IMPS OF DARKNESS TO A SPEEDY EXODUS
2624-173598-0017 THEY ARE COMELY TO LOOK UPON HE FURTHER TELLS US YET BY REASON OF THEIR MALICE THAT ISLAND IS OF LATE ABANDONED AND ALL WHO DWELT THERE HAVE FLED FOR REFUGE TO THE MAIN WHILE FRENCH FISHERMEN PLIED THEIR TRADE ALONG THESE GLOOMY COASTS
2624-173598-0018 THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SPENT IT'S ENERGIES ON A DIFFERENT FIELD THE VITALITY OF THE KINGDOM WAS WASTED IN ITALIAN WARS MILAN AND NAPLES OFFERED A MORE TEMPTING PRIZE THAN THE WILDS OF BACCALAOS EAGER FOR GLORY AND FOR PLUNDER
2624-173598-0019 A SWARM OF RESTLESS NOBLES FOLLOWED THEIR KNIGHT ERRANT KING THE WOULD BE PALADIN WHO MISSHAPEN IN BODY AND FANTASTIC IN MIND HAD YET THE POWER TO RAISE A STORM WHICH THE LAPSE OF GENERATIONS COULD NOT QUELL UNDER CHARLES THE EIGHTH AND HIS SUCCESSOR
2624-173598-0020 WAR AND INTRIGUE RULED THE DAY AND IN THE WHIRL OF ITALIAN POLITICS THERE WAS NO LEISURE TO THINK OF A NEW WORLD YET PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WAS NOT QUITE BENUMBED IN FIFTEEN O SIX ONE DENIS OF HONFLEUR
2624-173598-0021 THE BARON DE LERY MADE AN ABORTIVE ATTEMPT AT SETTLEMENT ON SABLE ISLAND WHERE THE CATTLE LEFT BY HIM REMAINED AND MULTIPLIED
2624-173598-0022 THERE WERE IN HIS NATURE SEEDS OF NOBLENESS SEEDS DESTINED TO BEAR LITTLE FRUIT CHIVALRY AND HONOR WERE ALWAYS ON HIS LIPS BUT FRANCIS THE FIRST A FORSWORN GENTLEMAN A DESPOTIC KING
2624-173598-0023 AND ADDED TO A STILL PREVAILING BARBARISM THE PESTILENTIAL VICES WHICH HUNG FOG LIKE AROUND THE DAWN OF CIVILIZATION YET HE ESTEEMED ARTS AND LETTERS AND STILL MORE COVETED THE ECLAT WHICH THEY COULD GIVE
2624-173598-0024 THE LIGHT WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO PIERCE THE FEUDAL DARKNESS GATHERED ITS RAYS AROUND HIS THRONE ITALY WAS REWARDING THE ROBBERS WHO PREYED ON HER WITH THE TREASURES OF HER KNOWLEDGE AND HER CULTURE AND ITALIAN GENIUS OF WHATEVER STAMP FOUND READY PATRONAGE AT THE HANDS OF FRANCIS
2624-173598-0025 AMONG ARTISTS PHILOSOPHERS AND MEN OF LETTERS ENROLLED IN HIS SERVICE STANDS THE HUMBLER NAME OF A FLORENTINE NAVIGATOR JOHN VERRAZZANO HE WAS BORN OF AN ANCIENT FAMILY WHICH COULD BOAST NAMES EMINENT IN FLORENTINE HISTORY
2624-173598-0026 AND OF WHICH THE LAST SURVIVOR DIED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HE HAS BEEN CALLED A PIRATE AND HE WAS SUCH IN THE SAME SENSE IN WHICH DRAKE HAWKINS AND OTHER VALIANT SEA ROVERS OF HIS OWN AND LATER TIMES MERITED THE NAME THAT IS TO SAY
2624-173598-0027 HE WOULD PLUNDER AND KILL A SPANIARD ON THE HIGH SEAS WITHOUT WAITING FOR A DECLARATION OF WAR THE WEALTH OF THE INDIES WAS POURING INTO THE COFFERS OF CHARLES THE FIFTH AND THE EXPLOITS OF CORTES HAD GIVEN NEW LUSTRE TO HIS CROWN
2624-173598-0028 FRANCIS THE FIRST BEGRUDGED HIS HATED RIVAL THE GLORIES AND PROFITS OF THE NEW WORLD HE WOULD FAIN HAVE HIS SHARE OF THE PRIZE AND VERRAZZANO WITH FOUR SHIPS WAS DESPATCHED TO SEEK OUT A PASSAGE WESTWARD TO THE RICH KINGDOM OF CATHAY
2624-173598-0029 SOME DOUBT HAS OF LATE BEEN CAST ON THE REALITY OF THIS VOYAGE OF VERRAZZANO AND EVIDENCE MAINLY NEGATIVE IN KIND HAS BEEN ADDUCED TO PROVE THE STORY OF IT A FABRICATION
2624-173598-0030 BUT THE DIFFICULTIES OF INCREDULITY APPEAR GREATER THAN THOSE OF BELIEF AND NO ORDINARY DEGREE OF SCEPTICISM IS REQUIRED TO REJECT THE EVIDENCE THAT THE NARRATIVE IS ESSENTIALLY TRUE TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR FIFTEEN TWENTY THREE
2624-173598-0031 BUT A STORM FELL UPON HIM AND WITH TWO OF THE VESSELS HE RAN BACK IN DISTRESS TO A PORT OF BRITTANY WHAT BECAME OF THE OTHER TWO DOES NOT APPEAR NEITHER IS IT CLEAR WHY AFTER A PRELIMINARY CRUISE AGAINST THE SPANIARDS HE PURSUED HIS VOYAGE WITH ONE VESSEL ALONE A CARAVEL CALLED
2624-173598-0032 WITH HER HE MADE FOR MADEIRA AND ON THE SEVENTEENTH OF JANUARY FIFTEEN TWENTY FOUR SET SAIL FROM A BARREN ISLET IN ITS NEIGHBORHOOD AND BORE AWAY FOR THE UNKNOWN WORLD IN FORTY NINE DAYS THEY NEARED A LOW SHORE
2624-173598-0033 NOT FAR FROM THE SITE OF WILMINGTON IN NORTH CAROLINA A NEWE LAND EXCLAIMS THE VOYAGER NEVER BEFORE SEEN OF ANY MAN EITHER AUNCIENT OR MODERNE VERRAZZANO STEERED SOUTHWARD IN SEARCH OF A HARBOR AND FINDING NONE TURNED NORTHWARD AGAIN
2624-173598-0034 PRESENTLY HE SENT A BOAT ASHORE THE INHABITANTS WHO HAD FLED AT FIRST SOON CAME DOWN TO THE STRAND IN WONDER AND ADMIRATION POINTING OUT A LANDING PLACE AND MAKING GESTURES OF FRIENDSHIP THESE PEOPLE SAYS VERRAZZANO GOE ALTOGETHER NAKED
2624-173598-0035 WHICH THEY FASTEN ONTO A NARROWE GIRDLE MADE OF GRASSE THEY ARE OF COLOUR RUSSET AND NOT MUCH UNLIKE THE SARACENS THEIR HAYRE BLACKE THICKE AND NOT VERY LONG WHICH THEY TYE TOGEATHER IN A KNOT BEHINDE AND WEARE IT LIKE A TAILE
2624-173598-0036 HE DESCRIBES THE SHORE AS CONSISTING OF SMALL LOW HILLOCKS OF FINE SAND INTERSECTED BY CREEKS AND INLETS AND BEYOND THESE A COUNTRY
2624-173598-0037 AND MANY OTHER SORTES OF TREES VNKNOWNE IN EUROPE WHICH YEELD MOST SWEETE SANOURS FARRE FROM THE SHORE STILL ADVANCING NORTHWARD
2624-173598-0038 THE SURF RAN HIGH AND THE CREW COULD NOT LAND BUT AN ADVENTUROUS YOUNG SAILOR JUMPED OVERBOARD AND SWAM SHOREWARD WITH A GIFT OF BEADS AND TRINKETS FOR THE INDIANS WHO STOOD WATCHING HIM HIS HEART FAILED AS HE DREW NEAR HE FLUNG HIS GIFT AMONG THEM TURNED AND STRUCK OUT FOR THE BOAT
2624-173598-0039 THE SURF DASHED HIM BACK FLINGING HIM WITH VIOLENCE ON THE BEACH AMONG THE RECIPIENTS OF HIS BOUNTY WHO SEIZED HIM BY THE ARMS AND LEGS AND WHILE HE CALLED LUSTILY FOR AID
2624-173598-0040 NEXT THEY KINDLED A GREAT FIRE DOUBTLESS TO ROAST AND DEVOUR HIM BEFORE THE EYES OF HIS COMRADES GAZING IN HORROR FROM THEIR BOAT ON THE CONTRARY
2624-173598-0041 WHEN RECOVERING FROM HIS BEWILDERMENT HE BETRAYED A STRONG DESIRE TO ESCAPE TO HIS FRIENDS WHEREUPON WITH GREAT LOVE CLAPPING HIM FAST ABOUT WITH MANY EMBRACINGS THEY LED HIM TO THE SHORE AND STOOD WATCHING TILL HE HAD REACHED THE BOAT IT ONLY REMAINED TO REQUITE THIS KINDNESS
2624-173598-0042 AND AN OPPORTUNITY SOON OCCURRED FOR COASTING THE SHORES OF VIRGINIA OR MARYLAND A PARTY WENT ON SHORE AND FOUND AN OLD WOMAN A YOUNG GIRL AND SEVERAL CHILDREN HIDING WITH GREAT TERROR IN THE GRASS HAVING BY VARIOUS BLANDISHMENTS GAINED THEIR CONFIDENCE
2624-173598-0043 IN HIS BOAT THROUGH THE NARROWS UNDER THE STEEP HEIGHTS OF STATEN ISLAND HE SAW THE HARBOR WITHIN DOTTED WITH CANOES OF THE FEATHERED NATIVES COMING FROM THE SHORE TO WELCOME HIM BUT WHAT MOST ENGAGED THE EYES OF THE WHITE MEN WERE THE FANCIED SIGNS OF MINERAL WEALTH
2624-173598-0044 IN THE NEIGHBORING HILLS FOLLOWING THE SHORES OF LONG ISLAND
