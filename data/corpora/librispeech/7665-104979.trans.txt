7665-104979-0000 CHAPTER TWO QUESTIONS I KNEW ALL THE CURRENT GOSSIP ABOUT MISSUS PACKARD BEFORE I HAD PARTED WITH MISS DAVIES HER STORY WAS A SIMPLE ONE BRED IN THE WEST
7665-104979-0001 TO LIVE WITH THAT MOTHER'S BROTHER IN DETROIT IN DOING THIS SHE HAD WALKED INTO A FORTUNE HER UNCLE WAS A RICH MAN AND WHEN HE DIED
7665-104979-0002 AND REMOVAL TO C SHE FOUND HERSELF THE RECIPIENT OF AN ENORMOUS LEGACY SHE WAS THEREFORE A WOMAN OF INDEPENDENT MEANS AN ADVANTAGE WHICH
7665-104979-0003 AND MANNERS AT ONCE DIGNIFIED AND WINNING CAUSED HER TO BE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS A WOMAN GREATLY TO BE ENVIED BY ALL WHO APPRECIATED A WELL FOUNDED POPULARITY SO MUCH FOR PUBLIC OPINION
7665-104979-0004 IT DIFFERS MATERIALLY FROM THAT JUST GIVEN ME BY HER HUSBAND THE MAYOR LIVED ON FRANKLIN STREET IN A QUARTER I HAD SELDOM VISITED AS I ENTERED THIS ONCE ARISTOCRATIC THOROUGHFARE FROM CARLTON AVENUE
7665-104979-0005 I WAS STRUCK AS I HAD BEEN BEFORE BY ITS HETEROGENEOUS APPEARANCE
7665-104979-0006 AND IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE MANSION AND HOVEL CONFRONTING EACH OTHER FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET SHOULD I FIND THE NUMBER I SOUGHT ATTACHED TO ONE OF THE CRUDE UNMEANING DWELLINGS I WAS CONSTANTLY PASSING
7665-104979-0007 IF NOT TO THE TASTE OF THE CITY'S MAYOR A LITTLE SHOP ONE STORY IN HEIGHT AND OLD ENOUGH FOR ITS SIMPLE WOODEN WALLS TO CRY ALOUD FOR PAINT
7665-104979-0008 DIRECTLY OPPOSITE IT WERE TWO CONSPICUOUS DWELLINGS NEITHER OF THEM NEW AND ONE OF THEM ANCIENT AS THE STREET ITSELF THEY STOOD FAIRLY CLOSE TOGETHER WITH AN ALLEY RUNNING BETWEEN FROM THE NUMBER I HAD NOW REACHED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE MAYOR LIVED IN ONE OF THESE
7665-104979-0009 HAPPILY IT WAS IN THE FRESHER AND MORE INVITING ONE AS I NOTED THIS I PAUSED IN ADMIRATION OF ITS SPACIOUS FRONT AND IMPOSING DOORWAY THE LATTER WAS IN THE BEST STYLE OF COLONIAL ARCHITECTURE AND THOUGH RAISED BUT ONE STEP FROM THE WALK
7665-104979-0010 THAT I FELT MYSELF CARRIED BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN SUCH DOMICILES WERE FEW AND DENOTED WEALTH THE MOST SOLID AND HOSPITALITY THE MOST GENEROUS A LIGHT WALL PAINTED TO MATCH THE HOUSE EXTENDED WITHOUT BREAK TO THE ADJOINING BUILDING
7665-104979-0011 A STRUCTURE EQUAL TO THE OTHER IN AGE AND DIMENSIONS BUT DIFFERING IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS AS MUCH AS NEGLECT AND MISUSE COULD MAKE IT GRAY AND FORBIDDING
7665-104979-0012 WITH CHEERFUL COMPOSURE WHAT SHOULD I HAVE THOUGHT IF AT THAT MOMENT I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT APPEARANCES WERE DECEITFUL AND THAT THERE WERE MANY PERSONS THEN LIVING WHO IF LEFT TO THEIR CHOICE WOULD PREFER LIFE IN THE DISMAL WALLS FROM WHICH I HAD INSTINCTIVELY TURNED
7665-104979-0013 TO A SINGLE NIGHT SPENT IN THE PROMISING HOUSE I WAS SO EAGER TO ENTER AN OLD SERVING MAN WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH STRUCK ME PLEASANTLY ENOUGH AT THE TIME OPENED THE DOOR IN RESPONSE TO MY RING
7665-104979-0014 ONLY TO MAKE INSTANT WAY FOR MAYOR PACKARD WHO ADVANCED FROM SOME NEAR BY ROOM TO GREET ME BY THIS THOUGHTFUL ATTENTION I WAS SPARED THE EMBARRASSMENT FROM WHICH I MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE SUFFERED
7665-104979-0015 SAID HE AS HE LED ME AROUND THE STAIRS TOWARD AN OPENING AT THEIR REAR BUT SHE'S A KIND WOMAN
7665-104979-0016 HAPPILY I WAS NOT CALLED UPON TO ANSWER
7665-104979-0017 THE WOMAN WHO SAT IN ITS GLOW MADE AN INSTANT AND PERMANENT IMPRESSION UPON ME NO ONE COULD LOOK INTENTLY UPON HER WITHOUT FEELING THAT HERE WAS A WOMAN OF INDIVIDUALITY AND POWER OVERSHADOWED AT PRESENT BY THE DEEPEST MELANCHOLY
7665-104979-0018 AS SHE ROSE AND FACED US I DECIDED INSTANTLY THAT HER HUSBAND HAD NOT EXAGGERATED HER STATE OF MIND EMOTION OF NO ORDINARY NATURE DISTURBED THE LINES OF HER COUNTENANCE
7665-104979-0019 OF ITS DIGNITY AND GRACE AND THOUGH SHE IMMEDIATELY CONTROLLED HERSELF AND ASSUMED THE IMPOSING ASPECT OF A HIGHLY TRAINED WOMAN READY
7665-104979-0020 I COULD NOT EASILY FORGET THE DRAWN LOOK ABOUT MOUTH AND EYES WHICH IN THE FIRST INSTANT OF OUR MEETING HAD DISTORTED FEATURES NATURALLY HARMONIOUS AND BEAUTIFULLY SERENE I AM SURE HER HUSBAND HAD OBSERVED IT ALSO
7665-104979-0021 FOR HIS VOICE TREMBLED SLIGHTLY AS HE ADDRESSED HER I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A COMPANION OLYMPIA
7665-104979-0022 DO YOU NOT SEE REASON FOR THANKING ME THIS LAST QUESTION HE POINTED WITH A GLANCE IN MY DIRECTION
7665-104979-0023 I MET HER EYES FAIRLY THEY WERE LARGE AND GRAY AND MEANT FOR SMILING EYES THAT WITH A HAPPY HEART BEHIND THEM WOULD ILLUMINE HER OWN BEAUTY AND CREATE JOY IN THOSE UPON WHOM THEY FELL BUT TO DAY
7665-104979-0024 I THINK I AM SURE THAT MY THANKS ARE DUE YOU SHE COURTEOUSLY REPLIED WITH A QUICK TURN TOWARD HER HUSBAND
7665-104979-0025 AS I THOUGHT OF LOVE I DREADED BEING LEFT ALONE
7665-104979-0026 THEN WE TALKED A LITTLE AFTER WHICH MAYOR PACKARD FOUND SOME EXCUSE FOR TAKING ME FROM THE ROOM NOW FOR THE FEW WORDS YOU REQUESTED SAID HE AND PRECEDING ME DOWN THE HALL HE LED ME INTO WHAT HE CALLED HIS STUDY
7665-104979-0027 I NOTED ONE THING AND ONLY ONE THING ON ENTERING THIS PLACE THAT WAS THE PRESENCE OF A YOUNG MAN WHO SAT AT A DISTANT TABLE READING AND MAKING NOTES BUT AS MAYOR PACKARD TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIM KNOWING AND EXPECTING HIM TO BE THERE NO DOUBT
7665-104979-0028 WITHDREW MY EYES FROM THE HANDSOMEST FACE I HAD EVER SEEN AND
7665-104979-0029 I TOOK MY PLACE AT HIS SIDE WITHOUT KNOWING VERY WELL WHAT THIS MOVE MEANT OR WHAT HE EXPECTED ME TO DO THERE I WAS NOT LONG LEFT IN DOUBT WITH A GESTURE TOWARD THE TYPE WRITER
7665-104979-0030 HE ASKED ME IF I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ITS USE AND WHEN I ACKNOWLEDGED SOME SORT OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH IT HE DREW AN UNANSWERED LETTER FROM A PILE ON THE TABLE AND REQUESTED ME TO COPY IT AS A SAMPLE I IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN BEFORE THE TYPE WRITER
7665-104979-0031 AS I PROCEEDED TO INSERT THE PAPER AND LAY OUT THE COPY TO HAND HE CROSSED OVER TO THE YOUNG MAN AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN A SHORT CONVERSATION WHICH ENDED IN SOME TRIVIAL DEMAND THAT SENT THE YOUNG MAN FROM THE ROOM
7665-104979-0032 KEEP ON WITH YOUR WORK AND NEVER MIND MISTAKES SAID HE WHAT I WANT IS TO HEAR THE QUESTIONS YOU TOLD ME TO EXPECT FROM YOU IF YOU STAYED SEEMINGLY MAYOR PACKARD DID NOT WISH THIS YOUNG MAN TO KNOW MY POSITION IN THE HOUSE
7665-104979-0033 WAS IT POSSIBLE HE DID NOT WHOLLY TRUST HIM MY HANDS TREMBLED FROM THE MACHINE AND I WAS ABOUT TO TURN AND GIVE MY FULL THOUGHT TO WHAT I HAD TO SAY BUT PRIDE CHECKED THE IMPULSE NO I MUTTERED IN QUICK DISSUASION TO MYSELF
7665-104979-0034 HE MUST SEE THAT I CAN DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE AND DO BOTH WELL AND SO I WENT ON WITH THE LETTER WHEN I ASKED DID YOU FIRST SEE THE CHANGE IN MISSUS PACKARD ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON AT ABOUT THIS TIME
7665-104979-0035 WHAT HAD HAPPENED ON THAT DAY HAD SHE BEEN OUT YES I THINK SHE TOLD ME LATER THAT SHE HAD BEEN OUT DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO SOME CONCERT I BELIEVE I DID NOT PRESS HER WITH QUESTIONS MISS SAUNDERS
7665-104979-0036 I AM A POOR INQUISITOR CLICK CLICK THE MACHINE WAS WORKING ADMIRABLY HAVE YOU REASON TO THINK I NOW DEMANDED
7665-104979-0037 NO FOR WHEN I RETURNED HOME MYSELF AS I DID EARLIER THAN USUAL THAT NIGHT I HEARD HER LAUGHING WITH THE CHILD IN THE NURSERY
7665-104979-0038 THAT I CAME UPON HER SITTING IN SUCH A DAZE OF MISERY THAT SHE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ME WHEN I SPOKE TO HER I THOUGHT IT WAS A PASSING MOOD AT THE TIME SHE IS A SENSITIVE WOMAN AND SHE HAD BEEN READING
7665-104979-0039 I SAW THE BOOK LYING ON THE FLOOR AT HER SIDE BUT WHEN HAVING RECOVERED FROM HER DEJECTION A DEJECTION MIND YOU WHICH SHE WOULD NEITHER ACKNOWLEDGE NOR EXPLAIN SHE ACCOMPANIED ME OUT TO DINNER SHE SHOWED EVEN MORE FEELING ON OUR RETURN
7665-104979-0040 SHRINKING UNACCOUNTABLY FROM LEAVING THE CARRIAGE AND SHOWING NOT ONLY IN THIS WAY BUT IN OTHERS
7665-104979-0041 LEAVE YOU MY FINGERS PAUSED MY ASTONISHMENT HAD GOT THE BETTER OF ME YES IT IS AS BAD AS THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY YOU WILL SEND ME A TELEGRAM OF THREE WORDS SHE HAS GONE YET SHE LOVES ME REALLY
7665-104979-0042 AND TRULY LOVES ME THAT IS THE MYSTERY OF IT MORE THAN THIS HER VERY HEART STRINGS ARE KNIT UP WITH THOSE OF OUR CHILD MAYOR PACKARD I HAD RESUMED WORK WAS ANY LETTER DELIVERED TO HER THAT DAY

7665-104979-0044 SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWN ME ANY SUCH IF ONLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD SHE IS PHYSICALLY A VERY BRAVE WOMAN AND NOT AT ALL NERVOUS THOSE LETTERS SOMETIMES ASSUME THE SHAPE OF CALUMNY
7665-104979-0045 SHE BELIEVES IN MY CHARACTER AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO VINDICATE MYSELF I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MY WIFE'S SENSE OF JUSTICE I EXPERIENCED A THRILL OF ADMIRATION FOR THE APPRECIATION HE EVINCED IN THOSE WORDS
7665-104979-0046 YET I PURSUED THE SUBJECT RESOLUTELY HAVE YOU AN ENEMY MAYOR PACKARD ANY REAL AND DOWNRIGHT ENEMY CAPABLE OF A DEEP AND SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT DESTROYING YOUR HAPPINESS NONE THAT I KNOW OF MISS SAUNDERS
