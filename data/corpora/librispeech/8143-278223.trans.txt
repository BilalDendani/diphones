8143-278223-0000 WHAT HAPPENED AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY EARLY THE NEXT DAY CLEMENT AUSTIN WALKED TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY IN ORDER TO PROCURE ALL THE INFORMATION LIKELY TO FACILITATE MARGARET WILMOT'S GRAND PURPOSE
8143-278223-0001 HE STOPPED AT THE GATE OF THE PRINCIPAL LODGE THE WOMAN WHO KEPT IT WAS AN OLD SERVANT OF THE DUNBAR FAMILY AND HAD KNOWN CLEMENT AUSTIN IN PERCIVAL DUNBAR'S LIFETIME SHE GAVE HIM A HEARTY WELCOME
8143-278223-0002 AND HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER IN SETTING HER TONGUE IN MOTION UPON THE SUBJECT OF HENRY DUNBAR SHE TOLD HIM A GREAT DEAL SHE TOLD HIM THAT THE PRESENT OWNER OF THE ABBEY NEVER HAD BEEN LIKED
8143-278223-0003 AND NEVER WOULD BE LIKED FOR HIS STERN AND GLOOMY MANNER WAS SO UNLIKE HIS FATHER'S EASY AFFABLE GOOD NATURE THAT PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS DRAWING COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE DEAD MAN AND THE LIVING
8143-278223-0004 THIS IN A FEW WORDS IS THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THE WORTHY WOMAN SAID IN A GOOD MANY WORDS MISSUS GRUMBLETON GAVE CLEMENT ALL THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRED
8143-278223-0005 AS TO THE BANKER'S DAILY MOVEMENTS AT THE PRESENT TIME HENRY DUNBAR WAS NOW IN THE HABIT OF RISING ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE DAY AT WHICH TIME HE WAS ASSISTED FROM HIS BEDROOM TO HIS SITTING ROOM WHERE HE REMAINED
8143-278223-0006 UNTIL SEVEN OR EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING HE HAD NO VISITORS EXCEPT THE SURGEON MISTER DAPHNEY WHO LIVED IN THE ABBEY AND A GENTLEMAN CALLED VERNON WHO HAD BOUGHT WOODBINE COTTAGE NEAR LISFORD
8143-278223-0007 AND WHO NOW AND THEN WAS ADMITTED TO MISTER DUNBAR'S SITTING ROOM THIS WAS ALL CLEMENT AUSTIN WANTED TO KNOW SURELY IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE WITH A LITTLE CLEVER MANAGEMENT
8143-278223-0008 TO THROW THE BANKER COMPLETELY OFF HIS GUARD AND TO BRING ABOUT THE LONG DELAYED INTERVIEW BETWEEN HIM AND MARGARET WILMOT CLEMENT RETURNED TO THE REINDEER HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH MARGARET AND MADE ALL ARRANGEMENTS
8143-278223-0009 AT FOUR O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON MISS WILMOT AND HER LOVER LEFT THE REINDEER IN A FLY AT A QUARTER TO FIVE THE FLY STOPPED AT THE LODGE GATES I WILL WALK TO THE HOUSE MARGARET SAID
8143-278223-0010 MY COMING WILL ATTRACT LESS NOTICE BUT I MAY BE DETAINED FOR SOME TIME CLEMENT PRAY DON'T WAIT FOR ME YOUR DEAR MOTHER WILL BE ALARMED IF YOU ARE VERY LONG ABSENT GO BACK TO HER AND SEND THE FLY FOR ME BY AND BY NONSENSE MADGE
8143-278223-0011 I WON'T GO WITH YOU TO THE ABBEY FOR IT WILL BE AS WELL THAT HENRY DUNBAR SHOULD REMAIN IN IGNORANCE OF MY PRESENCE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD I WILL WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROAD HERE AND WAIT FOR YOU BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG CLEMENT
8143-278223-0012 NO MATTER HOW LONG I CAN WAIT PATIENTLY
8143-278223-0013 THEY WERE STANDING BEFORE THE GREAT IRON GATES AS CLEMENT SAID THIS HE PRESSED MARGARET'S COLD HAND HE COULD FEEL HOW COLD IT WAS EVEN THROUGH HER GLOVE AND THEN RANG THE BELL
8143-278223-0014 SHE LOOKED AT HIM AS THE GATE WAS OPENED SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH A STRANGELY EARNEST GAZE AS SHE CROSSED THE BOUNDARY OF HENRY DUNBAR'S DOMAIN AND THEN WALKED SLOWLY ALONG THE BROAD AVENUE
8143-278223-0015 THAT LAST LOOK HAD SHOWN CLEMENT AUSTIN A PALE RESOLUTE FACE SOMETHING LIKE THE COUNTENANCE OF A FAIR YOUNG MARTYR GOING QUIETLY TO THE STAKE HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE GATES
8143-278223-0016 AND THEY SHUT BEHIND HIM WITH A LOUD CLANGING NOISE THEN HE WENT BACK TO THEM AND WATCHED MARGARET'S FIGURE GROWING DIM AND DISTANT IN THE GATHERING DUSK AS SHE APPROACHED THE ABBEY
8143-278223-0017 A FAINT GLOW OF CRIMSON FIRELIGHT REDDENED THE GRAVEL DRIVE BEFORE THE WINDOWS OF MISTER DUNBAR'S APARTMENTS
8143-278223-0018 WITH A GLIMMER OF LIGHT SHINING OUT OF THE HALL BEHIND HIM I DO NOT SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO WAIT VERY LONG FOR MY POOR GIRL CLEMENT THOUGHT AS HE LEFT THE GATES AND WALKED BRISKLY UP AND DOWN THE ROAD HENRY DUNBAR IS A RESOLUTE MAN
8143-278223-0019 HE WILL REFUSE TO SEE HER TO DAY AS HE REFUSED BEFORE MARGARET FOUND THE FOOTMAN LOLLING AGAINST THE CLUSTERED PILLARS OF THE GOTHIC PORCH
8143-278223-0020 STARING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE LOW EVENING LIGHT YELLOW AND RED BEHIND THE BROWN TRUNKS OF THE ELMS AND PICKING HIS TEETH WITH A GOLD TOOTHPICK THE SIGHT OF THE OPEN HALL DOOR
8143-278223-0021 AND THIS LANGUID FOOTMAN LOLLING IN THE PORCH SUDDENLY INSPIRED MARGARET WILMOT WITH A NEW IDEA WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SLIP QUIETLY PAST THIS MAN AND WALK STRAIGHT TO THE APARTMENTS OF MISTER DUNBAR
8143-278223-0022 UNQUESTIONED UNINTERRUPTED CLEMENT HAD POINTED OUT TO HER THE WINDOWS OF THE ROOMS OCCUPIED BY THE BANKER THEY WERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE HALL IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO MISTAKE THE DOOR LEADING TO THEM
8143-278223-0023 IT WAS DUSK AND SHE WAS VERY PLAINLY DRESSED WITH A BLACK STRAW BONNET AND A VEIL OVER HER FACE SURELY SHE MIGHT DECEIVE THIS LANGUID FOOTMAN BY AFFECTING TO BE SOME HANGER ON OF THE HOUSEHOLD
8143-278223-0024 WHICH OF COURSE WAS A LARGE ONE IN THAT CASE SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO PRESENT HERSELF AT THE FRONT DOOR CERTAINLY BUT THEN BEFORE THE LANGUID FOOTMAN COULD RECOVER FROM THE FIRST SHOCK OF INDIGNATION AT HER IMPERTINENCE
8143-278223-0025 SHE MIGHT SLIP PAST HIM AND REACH THE DOOR LEADING TO THOSE APARTMENTS IN WHICH THE BANKER HID HIMSELF AND HIS GUILT MARGARET LINGERED A LITTLE IN THE AVENUE WATCHING FOR A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH SHE MIGHT HAZARD THIS ATTEMPT
8143-278223-0026 SHE WAITED FIVE MINUTES OR SO THE CURVE OF THE AVENUE SCREENED HER IN SOME WISE FROM THE MAN IN THE PORCH WHO NEVER HAPPENED TO ROLL HIS LANGUID EYES TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE SHE WAS STANDING
8143-278223-0027 A FLIGHT OF ROOKS CAME SCUDDING THROUGH THE SKY PRESENTLY VERY MUCH EXCITED AND CAWING AND SCREECHING AS IF THEY HAD BEEN AN ORNITHOLOGICAL FIRE BRIGADE HURRYING TO EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES OF SOME DISTANT ROOKERY
8143-278223-0028 THE FOOTMAN WHO WAS SUFFERING ACUTELY FROM THE COMPLAINT OF NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF CAME OUT OF THE PORCH AND STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GRAVELLED DRIVE WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS MARGARET
8143-278223-0029 STARING AT THE BIRDS AS THEY FLEW WESTWARD THIS WAS HER OPPORTUNITY THE GIRL HURRIED TO THE DOOR WITH A LIGHT STEP SO LIGHT UPON THE SMOOTH SOLID GRAVEL THAT THE FOOTMAN HEARD NOTHING UNTIL SHE WAS ON THE BROAD STONE STEP
8143-278223-0030 YOU THERE YOUNG WOMAN HE EXCLAIMED WITHOUT STIRRING FROM HIS POST WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO WHAT'S THE MEANING OF YOUR COMING TO THIS DOOR
8143-278223-0031 THAT THERE'S SUCH A PLACE AS A SERVANTS ALL AND A SERVANTS HENTRANCE BUT THE LANGUID RETAINER WAS TOO LATE MARGARET'S HAND WAS UPON THE MASSIVE KNOB OF THE DOOR UPON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HALL
8143-278223-0032 BEFORE THE FOOTMAN HAD PUT THIS LAST INDIGNANT QUESTION HE LISTENED FOR AN APOLOGETIC MURMUR FROM THE YOUNG WOMAN BUT HEARING NONE CONCLUDED THAT SHE HAD FOUND HER WAY TO THE SERVANTS HALL
8143-278223-0033 WHERE SHE HAD MOST LIKELY SOME BUSINESS OR OTHER WITH ONE OF THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD A DRESSMAKER I DESSAY THE FOOTMAN THOUGHT
8143-278223-0034 THOSE GALS SPEND ALL THEIR EARNINGS IN FINERY AND FALLALS INSTEAD OF BEHAVING LIKE RESPECTABLE YOUNG WOMEN AND SAVING UP THEIR MONEY AGAINST THEY CAN GO INTO THE PUBLIC LINE WITH THE MAN OF THEIR CHOICE HE YAWNED
8143-278223-0035 AND WENT ON STARING AT THE ROOKS WITHOUT TROUBLING HIMSELF ANY FURTHER ABOUT THE IMPERTINENT YOUNG PERSON WHO HAD DARED TO PRESENT HERSELF AT THE GRAND ENTRANCE MARGARET OPENED THE DOOR
8143-278223-0036 AND WENT INTO THE ROOM NEXT THE HALL IT WAS A HANDSOME APARTMENT LINED WITH BOOKS FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING BUT IT WAS QUITE EMPTY
8143-278223-0037 THE GIRL PUT UP HER VEIL AND LOOKED ABOUT HER SHE WAS VERY VERY PALE NOW AND TREMBLED VIOLENTLY BUT SHE CONTROLLED HER AGITATION BY A GREAT EFFORT AND WENT SLOWLY ON TO THE NEXT ROOM
8143-278223-0038 SHE HEARD THE LOW SOUND OF THE LIGHT ASHES FALLING ON THE HEARTH AND THE SHORTING BREATH OF A DOG SHE KNEW THAT THE MAN SHE SOUGHT AND HAD SO LONG SOUGHT WITHOUT AVAIL WAS IN THAT ROOM ALONE
8143-278223-0039 AND HER COURAGE FAILED HER ALL AT ONCE AND HER HEART SANK IN HER BREAST ON THE VERY THRESHOLD OF THE CHAMBER IN WHICH SHE WAS TO STAND FACE TO FACE WITH HENRY DUNBAR THE MURDERER OF MY FATHER
8143-278223-0040 SHE THOUGHT THE MAN WHOSE INFLUENCE BLIGHTED MY FATHER'S LIFE AND MADE HIM WHAT HE WAS THE MAN THROUGH WHOSE RECKLESS SIN MY FATHER LIVED A LIFE THAT LEFT HIM
8143-278223-0041 OH HOW SADLY UNPREPARED TO DIE THE MAN WHO KNOWING THIS SENT HIS VICTIM BEFORE AN OFFENDED GOD WITHOUT SO MUCH WARNING AS WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM TIME TO THINK ONE PRAYER
8143-278223-0042 I AM GOING TO MEET THAT MAN FACE TO FACE HER BREATH CAME IN FAINT GASPS AND THE FIRELIT CHAMBER SWAM BEFORE HER EYES AS SHE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF THAT DOOR
8143-278223-0043 AND WENT INTO THE ROOM WHERE HENRY DUNBAR WAS SITTING ALONE BEFORE THE LOW FIRE HE WAS WRAPPED IN CRIMSON DRAPERIES OF THICK WOOLLEN STUFF AND THE LEOPARD SKIN RAILWAY RUG
8143-278223-0044 WAS MUFFLED ABOUT HIS KNEES A DOG OF THE BULL DOG BREED WAS LYING ASLEEP AT THE BANKER'S FEET HALF HIDDEN IN THE FOLDS OF THE LEOPARD SKIN HENRY DUNBAR'S HEAD WAS BENT OVER THE FIRE
8143-278223-0045 AND HIS EYES WERE CLOSED IN A KIND OF DOZING SLEEP AS MARGARET WILMOT WENT INTO THE ROOM THERE WAS AN EMPTY CHAIR OPPOSITE TO THAT IN WHICH THE BANKER SAT AN OLD FASHIONED CARVED OAK CHAIR
8143-278223-0046 WITH A HIGH BACK AND CRIMSON MOROCCO CUSHIONS MARGARET WENT SOFTLY UP TO THIS CHAIR AND LAID HER HAND UPON THE OAKEN FRAMEWORK HER FOOTSTEPS MADE NO SOUND ON THE THICK TURKEY CARPET
8143-278223-0047 THE BANKER NEVER STIRRED FROM HIS DOZE AND EVEN THE DOG AT HIS FEET SLEPT ON MISTER DUNBAR CRIED MARGARET IN A CLEAR RESOLUTE VOICE AWAKE
8143-278223-0048 IT IS I MARGARET WILMOT THE DAUGHTER OF THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED IN THE GROVE NEAR WINCHESTER THE DOG AWOKE AND SNAPPED AT HER THE MAN LIFTED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT HER
8143-278223-0049 EVEN THE FIRE SEEMED ROUSED BY THE SOUND OF HER VOICE FOR A LITTLE JET OF VIVID LIGHT LEAPED UP OUT OF THE SMOULDERING LOG AND LIGHTED THE SCARED FACE OF THE BANKER CLEMENT AUSTIN HAD PROMISED MARGARET
8143-278223-0050 AND HE MEANT TO KEEP HIS PROMISE BUT THERE ARE SOME LIMITS EVEN TO THE PATIENCE OF A LOVER THOUGH HE WERE THE VERIEST KNIGHT ERRANT WHO WAS EVER EAGER TO SHIVER A LANCE OR HACK THE EDGE OF A BATTLE AXE FOR LOVE OF HIS LIEGE LADY
8143-278223-0051 WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO WALK UP AND DOWN A FEW YARDS OF HARD DUSTY HIGH ROAD UPON A BLEAK EVENING IN JANUARY AN HOUR MORE OR LESS IS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE
8143-278223-0052 BUT THE FAINT STROKES OF LISFORD CHURCH CLOCK DIED AWAY UPON THE COLD EVENING WIND AND CLEMENT WAS STILL PACING UP AND DOWN AND THE FLY WAS STILL WAITING
8143-278223-0053 THE HORSE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH A RUG UPON HIS BACK AND HIS NOSE IN A BAG OF OATS THE MAN WALKING UP AND DOWN BY THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE SLAPPING HIS GLOVED HANDS ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS EVERY NOW AND THEN TO KEEP HIMSELF WARM
8143-278223-0054 IN THAT LONG HOUR BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN CLEMENT AUSTIN'S PATIENCE WORE ITSELF ALMOST THREADBARE IT IS ONE THING TO RIDE INTO THE LISTS ON A PRANCING STEED
8143-278223-0055 CAPARISONED WITH EMBROIDERED TRAPPINGS WORKED BY THE FAIR HANDS OF YOUR LADY LOVE AND WITH THE TRUMPETS BRAYING AND THE POPULACE SHOUTING AND THE QUEEN OF BEAUTY SMILING SWEET APPROVAL OF YOUR PROWESS
8143-278223-0056 BUT IT IS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO WALK UP AND DOWN A DUSTY COUNTRY ROAD WITH THE WIND BITING LIKE SOME RAVENOUS ANIMAL AT THE TIP OF YOUR NOSE
8143-278223-0057 AND NO MORE CONSCIOUSNESS OF YOUR LEGS AND ARMS THAN IF YOU WERE A MISS BIFFIN BY THE TIME SEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK CLEMENT AUSTIN'S PATIENCE HAD GIVEN UP THE GHOST AND TO IMPATIENCE
8143-278223-0058 AND EXECUTED WITH SUCH A DIABOLICAL CUNNING THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE SO FAR TO ESCAPE DETECTION IN HIS OWN HOUSE SURROUNDED BY PRYING SERVANTS HE WOULD NEVER DARE TO ASSAIL THIS GIRL BY SO MUCH AS A HARSH WORD
8143-278223-0059 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS CLEMENT WAS DETERMINED TO WAIT NO LONGER HE WOULD GO TO THE ABBEY AT ONCE AND ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE OF MARGARET'S DELAY HE RANG THE BELL WENT INTO THE PARK
8143-278223-0060 LIGHTS WERE SHINING IN MISTER DUNBAR'S WINDOWS BUT THE GREAT HALL DOOR WAS CLOSELY SHUT THE LANGUID FOOTMAN CAME IN ANSWER TO CLEMENT'S SUMMONS THERE IS A YOUNG LADY HERE CLEMENT SAID BREATHLESSLY
8143-278223-0061 ASKED THE FOOTMAN SATIRICALLY
8143-278223-0062 THERE WAS A YOUNG PUSSON WITH MISTER DUNBAR ABOVE A HOUR AGO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN ABOVE AN HOUR AGO CRIED CLEMENT AUSTIN HEEDLESS OF THE MAN'S IMPERTINENCE IN HIS OWN GROWING ANXIETY
8143-278223-0063 SHE HAVE LEFT
8143-278223-0064 SHE WENT AWAY FROM THIS HOUSE AN HOUR AGO MORE THAN A HOUR AGO IMPOSSIBLE CLEMENT SAID IMPOSSIBLE
8143-278223-0065 WHO WAS OF AN IRONICAL TURN OF MIND BUT I LET HER OUT WITH MY OWN HANDS
8143-278223-0066 THE MAN SHUT THE DOOR BEFORE CLEMENT HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN THE PORCH BEWILDERED THOUGH HE SCARCELY KNEW WHY FRIGHTENED
