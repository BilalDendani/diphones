1736-142281-0000 NEW SCENES AND FACES MIST CLOGS THE SUNSHINE SMOKY DWARF HOUSES HAVE WE ROUND ON EVERY SIDE MATTHEW ARNOLD THE NEXT AFTERNOON ABOUT TWENTY MILES FROM MILTON NORTHERN THEY ENTERED ON THE LITTLE BRANCH RAILWAY THAT LED TO HESTON
1736-142281-0001 HESTON ITSELF WAS ONE LONG STRAGGLING STREET RUNNING PARALLEL TO THE SEASHORE
1736-142281-0002 TO USE A SCOTCH WORD EVERY THING LOOKED MORE PURPOSELIKE THE COUNTRY CARTS HAD MORE IRON AND LESS WOOD AND LEATHER ABOUT THE HORSE GEAR THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS ALTHOUGH ON PLEASURE BENT HAD YET A BUSY MIND THE COLOURS LOOKED GRAYER MORE ENDURING NOT SO GAY AND PRETTY
1736-142281-0003 THERE WERE NO SMOCK FROCKS EVEN AMONG THE COUNTRY FOLK
1736-142281-0004 HERE IF THEY HAD ANY LEISURE FROM CUSTOMERS THEY MADE THEMSELVES BUSINESS IN THE SHOP EVEN MARGARET FANCIED TO THE UNNECESSARY UNROLLING AND REROLLING OF RIBBONS
1736-142281-0005 THEIR TWO NIGHTS AT HOTELS HAD COST MORE THAN MISTER HALE HAD ANTICIPATED
1736-142281-0006 THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY DAYS DID MARGARET FEEL AT REST THERE WAS A DREAMINESS IN THE REST TOO WHICH MADE IT STILL MORE PERFECT AND LUXURIOUS TO REPOSE IN THE DISTANT SEA LAPPING THE SANDY SHORE WITH MEASURED SOUND THE NEARER CRIES OF THE DONKEY BOYS
1736-142281-0007 THE UNUSUAL SCENES MOVING BEFORE HER LIKE PICTURES WHICH SHE CARED NOT IN HER LAZINESS TO HAVE FULLY EXPLAINED BEFORE THEY PASSED AWAY THE STROLL DOWN TO THE BEACH TO BREATHE THE SEA AIR SOFT AND WARM ON THAT SANDY SHORE EVEN TO THE END OF NOVEMBER THE GREAT LONG MISTY SEA LINE TOUCHING THE TENDER COLOURED SKY
1736-142281-0008 THE WHITE SAIL OF A DISTANT BOAT TURNING SILVER IN SOME PALE SUNBEAM IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD DREAM HER LIFE AWAY IN SUCH LUXURY OF PENSIVENESS IN WHICH SHE MADE HER PRESENT ALL IN ALL FROM NOT DARING TO THINK OF THE PAST OR WISHING TO CONTEMPLATE THE FUTURE
1736-142281-0009 ONE EVENING IT WAS ARRANGED THAT MARGARET AND HER FATHER SHOULD GO THE NEXT DAY TO MILTON NORTHERN AND LOOK OUT FOR A HOUSE
1736-142281-0010 WHICH HE COULD ONLY DO BY AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LATTER GENTLEMAN MARGARET KNEW THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE REMOVING BUT SHE HAD A REPUGNANCE TO THE IDEA OF A MANUFACTURING TOWN AND BELIEVED THAT HER MOTHER WAS RECEIVING BENEFIT FROM HESTON AIR SO SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DEFERRED THE EXPEDITION TO MILTON
1736-142281-0011 FOR SEVERAL MILES BEFORE THEY REACHED MILTON THEY SAW A DEEP LEAD COLOURED CLOUD HANGING OVER THE HORIZON IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT LAY
1736-142281-0012 NEARER TO THE TOWN THE AIR HAD A FAINT TASTE AND SMELL OF SMOKE PERHAPS AFTER ALL MORE A LOSS OF THE FRAGRANCE OF GRASS AND HERBAGE THAN ANY POSITIVE TASTE OR SMELL
1736-142281-0013 HERE AND THERE A GREAT OBLONG MANY WINDOWED FACTORY STOOD UP LIKE A HEN AMONG HER CHICKENS PUFFING OUT BLACK UNPARLIAMENTARY SMOKE AND SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNTING FOR THE CLOUD WHICH MARGARET HAD TAKEN TO FORETELL RAIN AS THEY DROVE THROUGH THE LARGER AND WIDER STREETS FROM THE STATION TO THE HOTEL
1736-142281-0014 THEY HAD TO STOP CONSTANTLY GREAT LOADED LURRIES BLOCKED UP THE NOT OVER WIDE THOROUGHFARES
1736-142281-0015 HERE EVERY VAN EVERY WAGGON AND TRUCK BORE COTTON EITHER IN THE RAW SHAPE IN BAGS OR THE WOVEN SHAPE IN BALES OF CALICO
1736-142281-0016 PEOPLE THRONGED THE FOOTPATHS MOST OF THEM WELL DRESSED AS REGARDED THE MATERIAL BUT WITH A SLOVENLY LOOSENESS WHICH STRUCK MARGARET AS DIFFERENT FROM THE SHABBY THREADBARE SMARTNESS OF A SIMILAR CLASS IN LONDON NEW STREET SAID MISTER HALE
1736-142281-0017 THIS I BELIEVE IS THE PRINCIPAL STREET IN MILTON BELL HAS OFTEN SPOKEN TO ME ABOUT IT
1736-142281-0018 MISTER THORNTON'S MILL MUST BE SOMEWHERE NOT VERY FAR OFF FOR HE IS MISTER BELL'S TENANT BUT I FANCY HE DATES FROM HIS WAREHOUSE WHERE IS OUR HOTEL PAPA

1736-142281-0020 THEN WE WILL SET OFF WE WILL KEEP THE CAB IT WILL BE SAFER THAN LOSING OURSELVES AND BEING TOO LATE FOR THE TRAIN THIS AFTERNOON THERE WERE NO LETTERS AWAITING HIM
1736-142281-0021 THEY SET OUT ON THEIR HOUSE HUNTING THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR WAS ALL THEY COULD AFFORD TO GIVE BUT IN HAMPSHIRE THEY COULD HAVE MET WITH A ROOMY HOUSE AND PLEASANT GARDEN FOR THE MONEY HERE EVEN THE NECESSARY ACCOMMODATION OF TWO SITTING ROOMS AND FOUR BED ROOMS SEEMED UNATTAINABLE THEY WENT THROUGH THEIR LIST REJECTING EACH AS THEY VISITED IT
1736-142281-0022 WE MUST GO BACK TO THE SECOND I THINK THAT ONE IN CRAMPTON DON'T THEY CALL THE SUBURB THERE WERE THREE SITTING ROOMS DON'T YOU REMEMBER HOW WE LAUGHED AT THE NUMBER COMPARED WITH THE THREE BED ROOMS BUT I HAVE PLANNED IT ALL
1736-142281-0023 REALLY A PRETTY VIEW OVER THE PLAIN WITH A GREAT BEND OF RIVER OR CANAL OR WHATEVER IT IS DOWN BELOW THEN I COULD HAVE THE LITTLE BED ROOM BEHIND IN THAT PROJECTION AT THE HEAD OF THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS OVER THE KITCHEN YOU KNOW AND YOU AND MAMMA THE ROOM BEHIND THE DRAWING ROOM
1736-142281-0024 BUT DIXON AND THE GIRL WE ARE TO HAVE TO HELP OH WAIT A MINUTE I AM OVERPOWERED BY THE DISCOVERY OF MY OWN GENIUS FOR MANAGEMENT
1736-142281-0025 WON'T THAT DO I DARE SAY IT WILL BUT
1736-142281-0026 THE DRAWING ROOM AND YOUR BED ROOM FOR MAMMA WILL COME MOST IN CONTACT WITH THEM AND YOUR BOOK SHELVES WILL HIDE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT GAUDY PATTERN IN THE DINING ROOM THEN YOU THINK IT THE BEST IF SO I HAD BETTER GO AT ONCE AND CALL ON THIS MISTER DONKIN TO WHOM THE ADVERTISEMENT REFERS ME
1736-142281-0027 BY THE TIME IT IS READY I SHALL BE WITH YOU I HOPE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GET NEW PAPERS MARGARET HOPED SO TOO THOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING SHE HAD NEVER COME FAIRLY IN CONTACT WITH THE TASTE THAT LOVES ORNAMENT HOWEVER BAD MORE THAN THE PLAINNESS AND SIMPLICITY WHICH ARE OF THEMSELVES THE FRAMEWORK OF ELEGANCE
1736-142281-0028 SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A QUICK STEPPING WAITER I BEG YOUR PARDON MA'AM
1736-142281-0029 AS I UNDERSTOOD FROM WHAT THE GENTLEMAN SAID YOU WOULD BE BACK IN AN HOUR I TOLD HIM SO AND HE CAME AGAIN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AGO AND SAID HE WOULD WAIT FOR MISTER HALE HE IS IN YOUR ROOM NOW MA'AM THANK YOU MY FATHER WILL RETURN SOON AND THEN YOU CAN TELL HIM
1736-142281-0030 MARGARET OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT IN WITH THE STRAIGHT FEARLESS DIGNIFIED PRESENCE HABITUAL TO HER
1736-142281-0031 A YOUNG LADY OF A DIFFERENT TYPE TO MOST OF THOSE HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF SEEING
1736-142281-0032 A DARK SILK GOWN WITHOUT ANY TRIMMING OR FLOUNCE
1736-142281-0033 HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHO SHE WAS
1736-142281-0034 HE HAD HEARD THAT MISTER HALE HAD A DAUGHTER BUT
1736-142281-0035 MY FATHER BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR NOT A MINUTE AGO BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS NOT TOLD THAT YOU WERE HERE AND HE HAS GONE AWAY ON SOME BUSINESS BUT HE WILL COME BACK ALMOST DIRECTLY
1736-142281-0036 MISTER THORNTON WAS IN HABITS OF AUTHORITY HIMSELF BUT SHE SEEMED TO ASSUME SOME KIND OF RULE OVER HIM AT ONCE HE HAD BEEN GETTING IMPATIENT AT THE LOSS OF HIS TIME ON A MARKET DAY THE MOMENT BEFORE SHE APPEARED YET NOW HE CALMLY TOOK A SEAT AT HER BIDDING
1736-142281-0037 MISTER THORNTON HAD THOUGHT THAT THE HOUSE IN CRAMPTON WAS REALLY JUST THE THING BUT NOW THAT HE SAW MARGARET WITH HER SUPERB WAYS OF MOVING AND LOOKING HE BEGAN TO FEEL ASHAMED OF HAVING IMAGINED THAT IT WOULD DO VERY WELL FOR THE HALES IN SPITE OF A CERTAIN VULGARITY IN IT WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS LOOKING IT OVER
1736-142281-0038 MARGARET COULD NOT HELP HER LOOKS BUT THE SHORT CURLED UPPER LIP THE ROUND MASSIVE UP TURNED CHIN THE MANNER OF CARRYING HER HEAD HER MOVEMENTS FULL OF A SOFT FEMININE DEFIANCE
1736-142281-0039 SHE WAS TIRED NOW AND WOULD RATHER HAVE REMAINED SILENT AND TAKEN THE REST HER FATHER HAD PLANNED FOR HER
1736-142281-0040 SHE WISHED THAT HE WOULD GO AS HE HAD ONCE SPOKEN OF DOING INSTEAD OF SITTING THERE ANSWERING WITH CURT SENTENCES ALL THE REMARKS SHE MADE
1736-142281-0041 SHE SAT FACING HIM AND FACING THE LIGHT HER FULL BEAUTY MET HIS EYE HER ROUND WHITE FLEXILE THROAT RISING OUT OF THE FULL YET LITHE FIGURE HER LIPS MOVING SO SLIGHTLY AS SHE SPOKE NOT BREAKING THE COLD SERENE LOOK OF HER FACE WITH ANY VARIATION FROM THE ONE LOVELY HAUGHTY CURVE
1736-142281-0042 HER EYES WITH THEIR SOFT GLOOM MEETING HIS WITH QUIET MAIDEN FREEDOM
1736-142281-0043 HE TRIED SO TO COMPENSATE HIMSELF FOR THE MORTIFIED FEELING THAT WHILE HE LOOKED UPON HER WITH AN ADMIRATION HE COULD NOT REPRESS SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH PROUD INDIFFERENCE TAKING HIM HE THOUGHT FOR WHAT IN HIS IRRITATION HE TOLD HIMSELF HE WAS
1736-142281-0044 HER QUIET COLDNESS OF DEMEANOUR HE INTERPRETED INTO CONTEMPTUOUSNESS
1736-142281-0045 HER FATHER CAME IN AND WITH HIS PLEASANT GENTLEMANLY COURTEOUSNESS OF APOLOGY REINSTATED HIS NAME AND FAMILY IN MISTER THORNTON'S GOOD OPINION
1736-142281-0046 AND MARGARET GLAD THAT HER PART OF ENTERTAINING THE VISITOR WAS OVER
1736-142281-0047 AND HE HAD TO REPEAT WHAT HE SAID MARGARET THE LANDLORD WILL PERSIST IN ADMIRING THAT HIDEOUS PAPER AND I AM AFRAID WE MUST LET IT REMAIN OH DEAR I AM SORRY
1736-142281-0048 BY SOME OF HER SKETCHES BUT GAVE UP THE IDEA AT LAST AS LIKELY ONLY TO MAKE BAD WORSE
1736-142281-0049 HE WAS GLAD SHE DID NOT AND YET
1736-142281-0050 IT SEEMED EXCEEDINGLY LONG TO ME I WAS JUST AT THE LAST GASP WHEN YOU CAME IN
1736-142281-0051 VERY MUCH TO THE POINT THOUGH I SHOULD THINK HE IS A CLEARHEADED FELLOW HE SAID DID YOU HEAR THAT CRAMPTON IS ON GRAVELLY SOIL AND BY FAR THE MOST HEALTHY SUBURB IN THE NEIGHBOUR HOOD OF MILTON WHEN THEY RETURNED TO HESTON
1736-142281-0052 THERE WAS THE DAY'S ACCOUNT TO BE GIVEN TO MISSUS HALE WHO WAS FULL OF QUESTIONS WHICH THEY ANSWERED IN THE INTERVALS OF TEA DRINKING AND WHAT IS YOUR CORRESPONDENT MISTER THORNTON LIKE ASK MARGARET
1736-142281-0053 OH I HARDLY KNOW WHAT HE IS LIKE SAID MARGARET LAZILY TOO TIRED TO TAX HER POWERS OF DESCRIPTION MUCH AND THEN ROUSING HERSELF SHE SAID
1736-142281-0054 HOW OLD PAPA I SHOULD GUESS ABOUT THIRTY ABOUT THIRTY WITH A FACE THAT IS NEITHER EXACTLY PLAIN NOR YET HANDSOME NOTHING REMARKABLE NOT QUITE A GENTLEMAN BUT THAT WAS HARDLY TO BE EXPECTED NOT VULGAR OR COMMON THOUGH
1736-142281-0055 PUT IN HER FATHER RATHER JEALOUS OF ANY DISPARAGEMENT OF THE SOLE FRIEND HE HAD IN MILTON OH NO SAID MARGARET
1736-142281-0056 I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE TO BARGAIN WITH HIM HE LOOKS VERY INFLEXIBLE ALTOGETHER A MAN WHO SEEMS MADE FOR HIS NICHE MAMMA SAGACIOUS AND STRONG AS BECOMES A GREAT TRADESMAN DON'T CALL THE MILTON MANUFACTURERS TRADESMEN MARGARET SAID HER FATHER THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT
1736-142281-0057 PINK AND BLUE ROSES WITH YELLOW LEAVES AND SUCH A HEAVY CORNICE ROUND THE ROOM
1736-142281-0058 THE LANDLORD RECEIVED THEIR THANKS VERY COMPOSEDLY AND LET THEM THINK IF THEY LIKED THAT HE HAD RELENTED FROM HIS EXPRESSED DETERMINATION NOT TO REPAPER THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR NEED TO TELL THEM THAT WHAT HE DID NOT CARE TO DO FOR A REVEREND MISTER HALE UNKNOWN IN MILTON
