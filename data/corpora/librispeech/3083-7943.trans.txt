3083-7943-0000 IN MEMORY OF THAT BEAUTIFUL SUMMER IN THE OZARK HILLS WHEN SO OFTEN WE FOLLOWED THE OLD TRAIL AROUND THE RISE OF MUTTON HOLLOW THE TRAIL THAT IS NOBODY KNOWS HOW OLD AND FROM SAMMY'S LOOKOUT
3083-7943-0001 MORE LAUD THAN GILT O'ER DUSTED TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
3083-7943-0002 CHAPTER ONE THE STRANGER IT WAS CORN PLANTING TIME WHEN THE STRANGER FOLLOWED THE OLD TRAIL INTO THE MUTTON HOLLOW NEIGHBORHOOD ALL DAY A FINE RAIN HAD FALLEN STEADILY
3083-7943-0003 AND THE MISTS HUNG HEAVY OVER THE VALLEY THE LOWER HILLS WERE WRAPPED AS IN A WINDING SHEET DANK AND COLD THE TREES WERE DRIPPING WITH MOISTURE THE STRANGER LOOKED TIRED AND WET
3083-7943-0004 BY HIS DRESS THE MAN WAS FROM THE WORLD BEYOND THE RIDGES AND HIS CAREFULLY TAILORED CLOTHING LOOKED STRANGELY OUT OF PLACE IN THE MOUNTAIN WILDERNESS HIS FORM STOOPED A LITTLE IN THE SHOULDERS
3083-7943-0005 PERHAPS WITH WEARINESS BUT HE CARRIED HIMSELF WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS AIR OF ONE LONG USED TO A POSITION OF CONSPICUOUS POWER AND INFLUENCE AND WHILE HIS WELL KEPT HAIR AND BEARD WERE STRONGLY TOUCHED WITH WHITE
3083-7943-0006 THE BROWN CLEAR LIGHTED EYES THAT LOOKED FROM UNDER THEIR SHAGGY BROWS TOLD OF AN INTELLECT UNCLOUDED BY THE SHADOWS OF MANY YEARS IT WAS A FACE MARKED DEEPLY BY PRIDE PRIDE OF BIRTH OF INTELLECT
3083-7943-0007 OF CULTURE THE FACE OF A SCHOLAR AND POET BUT IT WAS MORE IT WAS THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE FAIRLY STAGGERING UNDER A BURDEN OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND GRIEF AS THE STRANGER WALKED
3083-7943-0008 HE LOOKED SEARCHINGLY INTO THE MISTS ON EVERY HAND AND PAUSED FREQUENTLY AS IF QUESTIONING THE PROPER COURSE SUDDENLY HE STEPPED QUICKLY FORWARD
3083-7943-0009 HIS EAR HAD CAUGHT THE SHARP RING OF A HORSE'S SHOE ON A FLINT ROCK SOMEWHERE IN THE MISTS ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE ABOVE IT WAS JED HOLLAND COMING DOWN THE TRAIL WITH A WEEK'S SUPPLY OF CORN MEAL IN A SACK ACROSS HIS HORSE'S BACK
3083-7943-0010 AS THE FIGURE OF THE TRAVELER EMERGED FROM THE MISTS THE NATIVE CHECKED HIS HORSE TO GREET THE NEWCOMER WITH THE CUSTOMARY SALUTATION OF THE BACKWOODS HOWDY THE MAN RETURNED JED'S GREETING CORDIALLY
3083-7943-0011 AND RESTING HIS SATCHEL ON A ROCK BESIDE THE NARROW PATH ADDED I AM VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU I FEAR THAT I AM LOST THE VOICE WAS MARVELOUSLY PURE DEEP AND MUSICAL
3083-7943-0012 AND LIKE THE BROWN EYES BETRAYED THE REAL STRENGTH OF THE MAN DENIED BY HIS GRAY HAIR AND BENT FORM THE TONES WERE AS DIFFERENT FROM THE HIGH KEYED SLURRING SPEECH OF THE BACKWOODS AS THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WAS UNLIKE ANY MAN JED HAD EVER MET
3083-7943-0013 THE BOY LOOKED AT THE SPEAKER IN WIDE EYED WONDER HE HAD A QUEER FEELING THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF A SUPERIOR BEING THROWING ONE THIN LEG OVER THE OLD MARE'S NECK AND WAVING A LONG ARM UP THE HILL AND TO THE LEFT JED DRAWLED
3083-7943-0014 DOWN YONDER'S MUTTON HOLLER THEN TURNING A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT AND POINTING INTO THE MIST WITH THE OTHER HAND HE CONTINUED

3083-7943-0036 LOWERING HIS LEG FROM THE HORSE'S NECK AND SETTLING THE MEAL SACK PREPARATORY TO MOVING

3083-7943-0039 AND AS HE CLIMBED UNSEEN BY HIM A SHADOWY FORM FLITTED FROM TREE TO TREE IN THE DIM DRIPPING FOREST AS THE STRANGER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE LANE CABIN A YOUNG WOMAN ON A BROWN PONY
3083-7943-0040 RODE OUT OF THE GATE AND UP THE TRAIL BEFORE HIM AND WHEN THE MAN REACHED THE OPEN GROUND ON THE MOUNTAIN ABOVE AND ROUNDED THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL HE SAW THE PONY FAR AHEAD LOPING EASILY ALONG THE LITTLE PATH
3083-7943-0041 A MOMENT HE WATCHED AND HORSE AND RIDER PASSED FROM SIGHT THE CLOUDS WERE DRIFTING FAR AWAY THE WESTERN SKY WAS CLEAR WITH THE SUN STILL ABOVE THE HILLS IN AN OLD TREE THAT LEANED FAR OUT OVER THE VALLEY
3083-7943-0042 A CROW SHOOK THE WET FROM HIS PLUMAGE AND DRIED HIMSELF IN THE WARM LIGHT WHILE FAR BELOW THE MISTS ROLLED AND ON THE SURFACE OF THAT GRAY SEA THE TRAVELER SAW A COMPANY OF BUZZARDS WHEELING AND CIRCLING ABOVE SOME DEAD THING HIDDEN IN ITS DEPTH
3083-7943-0043 WEARILY THE MAN FOLLOWED THE OLD TRAIL TOWARD THE MATTHEWS PLACE AND ALWAYS AS HE WENT IN THE EDGE OF THE GLOOMY FOREST
