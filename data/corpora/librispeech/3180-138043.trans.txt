3180-138043-0000 AND ALL THE DUCHESS'S DAMSELS AND DUENNAS GATHERED ROUND HIM WAITING IN PROFOUND SILENCE TO HEAR WHAT HE WOULD SAY IT WAS THE DUCHESS HOWEVER WHO SPOKE FIRST SAYING
3180-138043-0001 I SHOULD BE GLAD IF THE SENOR GOVERNOR WOULD RELIEVE ME OF CERTAIN DOUBTS I HAVE RISING OUT OF THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT DON QUIXOTE THAT IS NOW IN PRINT ONE IS INASMUCH AS WORTHY SANCHO NEVER SAW DULCINEA
3180-138043-0002 I MEAN THE LADY DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
3180-138043-0003 HOW DID HE DARE TO INVENT THE ANSWER AND ALL THAT ABOUT FINDING HER SIFTING WHEAT THE WHOLE STORY BEING A DECEPTION AND FALSEHOOD AND SO MUCH TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE PEERLESS DULCINEA'S GOOD NAME
3180-138043-0004 A THING THAT IS NOT AT ALL BECOMING THE CHARACTER AND FIDELITY OF A GOOD SQUIRE AT THESE WORDS SANCHO WITHOUT UTTERING ONE IN REPLY GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND WITH NOISELESS STEPS
3180-138043-0005 WITH HIS BODY BENT AND HIS FINGER ON HIS LIPS WENT ALL ROUND THE ROOM LIFTING UP THE HANGINGS AND THIS DONE HE CAME BACK TO HIS SEAT AND SAID NOW SENORA
3180-138043-0006 BUT FOR ALL THAT REALLY AND BEYOND ALL QUESTION
3180-138043-0007 WELL THEN AS THIS IS CLEAR TO MY MIND I CAN VENTURE TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE THINGS THAT HAVE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL LIKE THAT AFFAIR OF THE ANSWER TO THE LETTER AND THAT OTHER
3180-138043-0008 OF SIX OR EIGHT DAYS AGO WHICH IS NOT YET IN HISTORY THAT IS TO SAY THE AFFAIR OF THE ENCHANTMENT OF MY LADY DULCINEA FOR I MADE HIM BELIEVE SHE IS ENCHANTED
3180-138043-0009 AND THEN RESUMING THE DUCHESS SAID IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT WORTHY SANCHO HAS TOLD ME A DOUBT STARTS UP IN MY MIND AND THERE COMES A KIND OF WHISPER TO MY EAR THAT SAYS
3180-138043-0010 IF DON QUIXOTE BE MAD CRAZY AND CRACKED AND SANCHO PANZA HIS SQUIRE KNOWS IT AND NOTWITHSTANDING SERVES AND FOLLOWS HIM AND GOES TRUSTING TO HIS EMPTY PROMISES THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT HE MUST BE STILL MADDER
3180-138043-0011 KNOW HOW TO GOVERN OTHERS BY GOD SENORA SAID SANCHO BUT THAT DOUBT COMES TIMELY BUT YOUR GRACE MAY SAY IT OUT AND SPEAK PLAINLY
3180-138043-0012 OR AS YOU LIKE FOR I KNOW WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE AND IF I WERE WISE I SHOULD HAVE LEFT MY MASTER LONG AGO BUT THIS WAS MY FATE THIS WAS MY BAD LUCK I CAN'T HELP IT I MUST FOLLOW HIM
3180-138043-0013 EXCEPT THE PICKAXE AND SHOVEL AND IF YOUR HIGHNESS DOES NOT LIKE TO GIVE ME THE GOVERNMENT YOU PROMISED GOD MADE ME WITHOUT IT AND MAYBE YOUR NOT GIVING IT TO ME WILL BE ALL THE BETTER FOR MY CONSCIENCE FOR FOOL AS I AM
3180-138043-0014 I KNOW THE PROVERB TO HER HURT THE ANT GOT WINGS AND IT MAY BE THAT SANCHO THE SQUIRE WILL GET TO HEAVEN SOONER THAN SANCHO THE GOVERNOR
3180-138043-0015 AND BY NIGHT ALL CATS ARE GREY AND A HARD CASE ENOUGH HIS WHO HASN'T BROKEN HIS FAST AT TWO IN THE AFTERNOON AND THERE'S NO STOMACH A HAND'S BREADTH BIGGER THAN ANOTHER
3180-138043-0016 AND THE SAME CAN BE FILLED WITH STRAW OR HAY AS THE SAYING IS AND THE LITTLE BIRDS OF THE FIELD HAVE GOD FOR THEIR PURVEYOR AND CATERER AND
3180-138043-0017 AND WHEN WE QUIT THIS WORLD AND ARE PUT UNDERGROUND THE PRINCE TRAVELS BY AS NARROW A PATH AS THE JOURNEYMAN AND THE POPE'S BODY DOES NOT TAKE UP MORE FEET OF EARTH THAN THE SACRISTAN'S
3180-138043-0018 AND I SAY ONCE MORE IF YOUR LADYSHIP DOES NOT LIKE TO GIVE ME THE ISLAND BECAUSE I'M A FOOL LIKE A WISE MAN I WILL TAKE CARE TO GIVE MYSELF NO TROUBLE ABOUT IT I HAVE HEARD SAY THAT BEHIND THE CROSS THERE'S THE DEVIL
3180-138043-0019 AND THAT ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD AND THAT FROM AMONG THE OXEN AND THE PLOUGHS AND THE YOKES WAMBA THE HUSBANDMAN WAS TAKEN TO BE MADE KING OF SPAIN AND FROM AMONG BROCADES
3180-138043-0020 WHY THERE'S A BALLAD THAT SAYS THEY PUT KING RODRIGO ALIVE INTO A TOMB FULL OF TOADS AND ADDERS AND LIZARDS AND THAT TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS THE KING IN A PLAINTIVE FEEBLE VOICE
3180-138043-0021 THEY GNAW ME NOW THEY GNAW ME NOW THERE WHERE I MOST DID SIN AND ACCORDING TO THAT THE GENTLEMAN HAS GOOD REASON TO SAY HE WOULD RATHER BE A LABOURING MAN THAN A KING IF VERMIN ARE TO EAT HIM
3180-138043-0022 THE DUCHESS COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE SIMPLICITY OF HER DUENNA OR WONDERING AT THE LANGUAGE AND PROVERBS OF SANCHO TO WHOM SHE SAID WORTHY SANCHO KNOWS VERY WELL
3180-138043-0023 THAT WHEN ONCE A KNIGHT HAS MADE A PROMISE HE STRIVES TO KEEP IT THOUGH IT SHOULD COST HIM HIS LIFE MY LORD AND HUSBAND THE DUKE THOUGH NOT ONE OF THE ERRANT SORT IS NONE THE LESS A KNIGHT FOR THAT REASON
3180-138043-0024 AND WILL KEEP HIS WORD ABOUT THE PROMISED ISLAND IN SPITE OF THE ENVY AND MALICE OF THE WORLD
3180-138043-0025 FOR WHEN HE LEAST EXPECTS IT HE WILL FIND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE THRONE OF HIS ISLAND AND SEAT OF DIGNITY AND WILL TAKE POSSESSION OF HIS GOVERNMENT
3180-138043-0026 THE CHARGE I GIVE HIM IS TO BE CAREFUL HOW HE GOVERNS HIS VASSALS BEARING IN MIND THAT THEY ARE ALL LOYAL AND WELL BORN
3180-138043-0027 THERE'S NO NEED OF CHARGING ME TO DO THAT FOR I'M KIND HEARTED BY NATURE AND FULL OF COMPASSION FOR THE POOR THERE'S NO STEALING THE LOAF FROM HIM WHO KNEADS AND BAKES AND BY MY FAITH IT WON'T DO TO THROW FALSE DICE WITH ME
3180-138043-0028 BECAUSE WITH ME THE GOOD WILL HAVE SUPPORT AND PROTECTION AND THE BAD NEITHER FOOTING NOR ACCESS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE A BEGINNING IS EVERYTHING
3180-138043-0029 I'LL TAKE KINDLY TO THE WORK AND KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN THE FIELD LABOUR I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO YOU ARE RIGHT SANCHO SAID THE DUCHESS FOR NO ONE IS BORN READY TAUGHT
3180-138043-0030 PERSECUTE DON QUIXOTE FOR IN TRUTH AND EARNEST I KNOW FROM GOOD AUTHORITY THAT THE COARSE COUNTRY WENCH WHO JUMPED UP ON THE ASS WAS AND IS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO AND THAT WORTHY SANCHO THOUGH HE FANCIES HIMSELF THE DECEIVER
3180-138043-0031 IS THE ONE THAT IS DECEIVED AND THAT THERE IS NO MORE REASON TO DOUBT THE TRUTH OF THIS THAN OF ANYTHING ELSE WE NEVER SAW SENOR SANCHO PANZA MUST KNOW THAT WE TOO HAVE ENCHANTERS HERE
3180-138043-0032 THAT ARE WELL DISPOSED TO US AND TELL US WHAT GOES ON IN THE WORLD PLAINLY AND DISTINCTLY WITHOUT SUBTERFUGE OR DECEPTION AND BELIEVE ME SANCHO THAT AGILE COUNTRY LASS WAS AND IS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
3180-138043-0033 ALL THAT'S VERY POSSIBLE SAID SANCHO PANZA AND NOW I'M WILLING TO BELIEVE WHAT MY MASTER SAYS ABOUT WHAT HE SAW IN THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS
3180-138043-0034 IN THE VERY SAME DRESS AND APPAREL THAT I SAID I HAD SEEN HER IN WHEN I ENCHANTED HER ALL TO PLEASE MYSELF IT MUST BE ALL EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY AS YOUR LADYSHIP SAYS
3180-138043-0035 BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OUT OF MY POOR WIT SUCH A CUNNING TRICK COULD BE CONCOCTED IN A MOMENT
3180-138043-0036 SO OUT OF ALL REASON BUT SENORA YOUR EXCELLENCE MUST NOT THEREFORE THINK ME ILL DISPOSED FOR A DOLT LIKE ME IS NOT BOUND TO SEE INTO THE THOUGHTS AND PLOTS OF THOSE VILE ENCHANTERS
3180-138043-0037 I INVENTED ALL THAT TO ESCAPE MY MASTER'S SCOLDING AND NOT WITH ANY INTENTION OF HURTING HIM
3180-138043-0038 WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ALREADY TOUCHING THAT ADVENTURE AND HAVING HEARD IT THE DUCHESS SAID FROM THIS OCCURRENCE IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT AS THE GREAT DON QUIXOTE SAYS HE SAW
3180-138043-0039 AND I'M NOT GOING TO PICK A QUARREL WITH MY MASTER'S ENEMIES WHO SEEM TO BE MANY AND SPITEFUL THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ONE I SAW WAS A COUNTRY WENCH AND I SET HER DOWN TO BE A COUNTRY WENCH
3180-138043-0040 AND IF THAT WAS DULCINEA IT MUST NOT BE LAID AT MY DOOR NOR SHOULD I BE CALLED TO ANSWER FOR IT OR TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES BUT THEY MUST GO NAGGING AT ME AT EVERY STEP
3180-138043-0041 AS IF SANCHO WAS NOBODY AT ALL AND NOT THAT SAME SANCHO PANZA THAT'S NOW GOING ALL OVER THE WORLD IN BOOKS SO SAMSON CARRASCO TOLD ME AND HE'S AT ANY RATE ONE THAT'S A BACHELOR OF
3180-138043-0042 AND THEN I HAVE A GOOD CHARACTER AND AS I HAVE HEARD MY MASTER SAY A GOOD NAME IS BETTER THAN GREAT RICHES LET THEM ONLY STICK ME INTO THIS GOVERNMENT AND THEY'LL SEE WONDERS
3180-138043-0043 IN FACT TO SPEAK IN HIS OWN STYLE UNDER A BAD CLOAK THERE'S OFTEN A GOOD DRINKER
3180-138043-0044 I NEVER YET DRANK OUT OF WICKEDNESS FROM THIRST I HAVE VERY LIKELY FOR I HAVE NOTHING OF THE HYPOCRITE IN ME I DRINK WHEN I'M INCLINED OR IF I'M NOT INCLINED WHEN THEY OFFER IT TO ME
3180-138043-0045 SO AS NOT TO LOOK EITHER STRAIT LACED OR ILL BRED FOR WHEN A FRIEND DRINKS ONE'S HEALTH WHAT HEART CAN BE SO HARD AS NOT TO RETURN IT BUT IF I PUT ON MY SHOES I DON'T DIRTY THEM BESIDES
3180-138043-0046 SQUIRES TO KNIGHTS ERRANT MOSTLY DRINK WATER FOR THEY ARE ALWAYS WANDERING AMONG WOODS FORESTS AND MEADOWS MOUNTAINS AND CRAGS WITHOUT A DROP OF WINE TO BE HAD IF THEY GAVE THEIR EYES FOR IT
3180-138043-0047 AND WE WILL TALK BY AND BY AT GREATER LENGTH AND SETTLE HOW HE MAY SOON GO AND STICK HIMSELF INTO THE GOVERNMENT AS HE SAYS SANCHO ONCE MORE KISSED THE DUCHESS'S HAND AND ENTREATED HER TO LET GOOD CARE BE TAKEN OF HIS DAPPLE
3180-138043-0048 FOR HE WAS THE LIGHT OF HIS EYES WHAT IS DAPPLE SAID THE DUCHESS MY ASS SAID SANCHO WHICH NOT TO MENTION HIM BY THAT NAME I'M ACCUSTOMED TO CALL DAPPLE
3180-138043-0049 I BEGGED THIS LADY DUENNA HERE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM WHEN I CAME INTO THE CASTLE AND SHE GOT AS ANGRY AS IF I HAD SAID SHE WAS UGLY OR OLD THOUGH IT OUGHT TO BE MORE NATURAL AND PROPER FOR DUENNAS TO FEED ASSES THAN TO ORNAMENT CHAMBERS
3180-138043-0050 HE WOULD HAVE EXALTED THEM HIGHER THAN THE HORNS OF THE MOON THAT WILL DO SAID THE DUCHESS NO MORE OF THIS HUSH DONA RODRIGUEZ AND LET SENOR PANZA REST EASY
3180-138043-0051 FOR NEITHER HE NOR I ARE WORTHY TO REST A MOMENT IN THE APPLE OF YOUR HIGHNESS'S EYE AND I'D AS SOON STAB MYSELF AS CONSENT TO IT FOR THOUGH MY MASTER SAYS THAT IN CIVILITIES IT IS BETTER
3180-138043-0052 TO LOSE BY A CARD TOO MANY THAN A CARD TOO FEW WHEN IT COMES TO CIVILITIES TO ASSES WE MUST MIND WHAT WE ARE ABOUT AND KEEP WITHIN DUE BOUNDS
3180-138043-0053 I HAVE SEEN MORE THAN TWO ASSES GO TO GOVERNMENTS AND FOR ME TO TAKE MINE WITH ME WOULD BE NOTHING NEW SANCHO'S WORDS MADE THE DUCHESS LAUGH AGAIN AND GAVE HER FRESH AMUSEMENT
3180-138043-0054 AND ENTIRELY IN KNIGHT ERRANTRY STYLE AND IN THAT SAME STYLE THEY PRACTISED SEVERAL UPON HIM SO MUCH IN KEEPING AND SO CLEVER THAT THEY FORM THE BEST ADVENTURES THIS GREAT HISTORY CONTAINS
3180-138043-0055 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR WHICH RELATES HOW THEY LEARNED THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE TO DISENCHANT THE PEERLESS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
3180-138043-0056 AND MORE BENT THAN EVER UPON THE PLAN THEY HAD OF PRACTISING SOME JOKES UPON THEM THAT SHOULD HAVE THE LOOK AND APPEARANCE OF ADVENTURES THEY TOOK AS THEIR BASIS OF ACTION WHAT DON QUIXOTE HAD ALREADY TOLD THEM ABOUT THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS
3180-138043-0057 IN ORDER TO PLAY HIM A FAMOUS ONE BUT WHAT THE DUCHESS MARVELLED AT ABOVE ALL WAS THAT SANCHO'S SIMPLICITY COULD BE SO GREAT AS TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE AS ABSOLUTE TRUTH THAT DULCINEA HAD BEEN ENCHANTED
3180-138043-0058 WHEN IT WAS HE HIMSELF WHO HAD BEEN THE ENCHANTER AND TRICKSTER IN THE BUSINESS HAVING THEREFORE INSTRUCTED THEIR SERVANTS IN EVERYTHING THEY WERE TO DO SIX DAYS AFTERWARDS THEY TOOK HIM OUT TO HUNT
3180-138043-0059 BUT DON QUIXOTE DECLINED TO PUT HIS ON SAYING THAT HE MUST SOON RETURN TO THE HARD PURSUIT OF ARMS AND COULD NOT CARRY WARDROBES OR STORES WITH HIM SANCHO HOWEVER TOOK WHAT THEY GAVE HIM MEANING TO SELL IT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
3180-138043-0060 THE APPOINTED DAY HAVING ARRIVED
3180-138043-0061 AND MOUNTED ON HIS DAPPLE FOR HE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM UP THOUGH THEY OFFERED HIM A HORSE HE PLACED HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF THE TROOP OF HUNTSMEN THE DUCHESS CAME OUT SPLENDIDLY ATTIRED AND DON QUIXOTE IN PURE COURTESY AND POLITENESS
3180-138043-0062 HELD THE REIN OF HER PALFREY THOUGH THE DUKE WANTED NOT TO ALLOW HIM AND AT LAST THEY REACHED A WOOD THAT LAY BETWEEN TWO HIGH MOUNTAINS WHERE AFTER OCCUPYING VARIOUS POSTS AMBUSHES AND PATHS AND DISTRIBUTING THE PARTY IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS
3180-138043-0063 THE HUNT BEGAN WITH GREAT NOISE SHOUTING AND HALLOOING SO THAT BETWEEN THE BAYING OF THE HOUNDS AND THE BLOWING OF THE HORNS THEY COULD NOT HEAR ONE ANOTHER THE DUCHESS DISMOUNTED AND WITH A SHARP BOAR SPEAR IN HER HAND
3180-138043-0064 POSTED HERSELF WHERE SHE KNEW THE WILD BOARS WERE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING THE DUKE AND DON QUIXOTE LIKEWISE DISMOUNTED AND PLACED THEMSELVES ONE AT EACH SIDE OF HER
3180-138043-0065 WHEN THEY SAW A HUGE BOAR CLOSELY PRESSED BY THE HOUNDS AND FOLLOWED BY THE HUNTSMEN MAKING TOWARDS THEM GRINDING HIS TEETH AND TUSKS AND SCATTERING FOAM FROM HIS MOUTH AS SOON AS HE SAW HIM DON QUIXOTE BRACING HIS SHIELD ON HIS ARM
3180-138043-0066 GAVE WAY AND CAUGHT IN HIS FALL BY A BROKEN LIMB OF THE OAK HE HUNG SUSPENDED IN THE AIR UNABLE TO REACH THE GROUND FINDING HIMSELF IN THIS POSITION AND THAT THE GREEN COAT WAS BEGINNING TO TEAR
3180-138043-0067 AND REFLECTING THAT IF THE FIERCE ANIMAL CAME THAT WAY HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET AT HIM
3180-138043-0068 THAT ALL WHO HEARD HIM AND DID NOT SEE HIM FELT SURE HE MUST BE IN THE TEETH OF SOME WILD BEAST IN THE END
3180-138043-0069 WITHOUT SEEING DAPPLE OR DAPPLE WITHOUT SEEING SANCHO PANZA SUCH WAS THEIR ATTACHMENT AND LOYALTY ONE TO THE OTHER DON QUIXOTE WENT OVER AND UNHOOKED SANCHO WHO AS SOON AS HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE GROUND
3180-138043-0070 LOOKED AT THE RENT IN HIS HUNTINGCOAT AND WAS GRIEVED TO THE HEART FOR HE THOUGHT HE HAD GOT A PATRIMONIAL ESTATE IN THAT SUIT MEANWHILE THEY HAD SLUNG THE MIGHTY BOAR ACROSS THE BACK OF A MULE
3180-138043-0071 AND HAVING COVERED IT WITH SPRIGS OF ROSEMARY AND BRANCHES OF MYRTLE THEY BORE IT AWAY AS THE SPOILS OF VICTORY TO SOME LARGE FIELD TENTS
3180-138043-0072 IN SUCH GRAND AND SUMPTUOUS STYLE THAT IT WAS EASY TO SEE THE RANK AND MAGNIFICENCE OF THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED IT SANCHO AS HE SHOWED THE RENTS IN HIS TORN SUIT TO THE DUCHESS OBSERVED
3180-138043-0073 IF WE HAD BEEN HUNTING HARES OR AFTER SMALL BIRDS MY COAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE FROM BEING IN THE PLIGHT IT'S IN I DON'T KNOW WHAT PLEASURE ONE CAN FIND IN LYING IN WAIT FOR AN ANIMAL THAT MAY TAKE YOUR LIFE WITH HIS TUSK IF HE GETS AT YOU
3180-138043-0074 I RECOLLECT HAVING HEARD AN OLD BALLAD SUNG THAT SAYS BY BEARS BE THOU DEVOURED AS ERST WAS FAMOUS FAVILA
3180-138043-0075 IN IT EXTREME COLD AND INTOLERABLE HEAT HAVE TO BE BORNE INDOLENCE AND SLEEP ARE DESPISED THE BODILY POWERS ARE INVIGORATED THE LIMBS OF HIM WHO ENGAGES IN IT ARE MADE SUPPLE AND IN A WORD
3180-138043-0076 IT IS A PURSUIT WHICH MAY BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT INJURY TO ANYONE AND WITH ENJOYMENT TO MANY AND THE BEST OF IT IS IT IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY AS FIELD SPORTS OF OTHER SORTS ARE EXCEPT HAWKING
3180-138043-0077 WHICH ALSO IS ONLY FOR KINGS AND GREAT LORDS RECONSIDER YOUR OPINION THEREFORE SANCHO AND WHEN YOU ARE GOVERNOR TAKE TO HUNTING AND YOU WILL FIND THE GOOD OF IT NAY SAID SANCHO
3180-138043-0078 IT WOULD BE A NICE THING IF AFTER PEOPLE HAD BEEN AT THE TROUBLE OF COMING TO LOOK FOR HIM ON BUSINESS THE GOVERNOR WERE TO BE AWAY IN THE FOREST ENJOYING HIMSELF
3180-138043-0079 FOR THESE HUNTINGS DON'T SUIT MY CONDITION OR AGREE WITH MY CONSCIENCE GOD GRANT IT MAY TURN OUT SO SAID THE DUKE
3180-138043-0080 FROM SAYING TO DOING BE THAT AS IT MAY SAID SANCHO PLEDGES DON'T DISTRESS A GOOD PAYER AND HE WHOM GOD HELPS DOES BETTER THAN HE WHO GETS UP EARLY AND
3180-138043-0081 IT'S THE TRIPES THAT CARRY THE FEET AND NOT THE FEET THE TRIPES I MEAN TO SAY THAT IF GOD GIVES ME HELP AND I DO MY DUTY HONESTLY NO DOUBT I'LL GOVERN BETTER THAN A GERFALCON NAY
3180-138043-0082 LET THEM ONLY PUT A FINGER IN MY MOUTH AND THEY'LL SEE WHETHER I CAN BITE OR NOT
3180-138043-0083 WHEN WILL THE DAY COME AS I HAVE OFTEN SAID TO THEE WHEN I SHALL HEAR THEE MAKE ONE SINGLE COHERENT RATIONAL REMARK WITHOUT PROVERBS PRAY YOUR HIGHNESSES LEAVE THIS FOOL ALONE FOR HE WILL GRIND YOUR SOULS BETWEEN
3180-138043-0084 NOT TO SAY TWO BUT TWO THOUSAND PROVERBS
3180-138043-0085 AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS MAY GOD GRANT AS MUCH HEALTH TO HIM OR TO ME IF I WANT TO LISTEN TO THEM SANCHO PANZA'S PROVERBS SAID THE DUCHESS
3180-138043-0086 THOUGH MORE IN NUMBER THAN THE GREEK COMMANDER'S ARE NOT THEREFORE LESS TO BE ESTEEMED FOR THE CONCISENESS OF THE MAXIMS
3180-138043-0087 FOR MY OWN PART I CAN SAY THEY GIVE ME MORE PLEASURE THAN OTHERS THAT MAY BE BETTER BROUGHT IN AND MORE SEASONABLY INTRODUCED IN PLEASANT CONVERSATION OF THIS SORT THEY PASSED OUT OF THE TENT INTO THE WOOD
3180-138043-0088 AND THE DAY WAS SPENT IN VISITING SOME OF THE POSTS AND HIDING PLACES AND THEN NIGHT CLOSED IN NOT HOWEVER AS BRILLIANTLY OR TRANQUILLY AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AT THE SEASON FOR IT WAS THEN MIDSUMMER
3180-138043-0089 BUT BRINGING WITH IT A KIND OF HAZE THAT GREATLY AIDED THE PROJECT OF THE DUKE AND DUCHESS AND THUS AS NIGHT BEGAN TO FALL AND A LITTLE AFTER TWILIGHT SET IN SUDDENLY THE WHOLE WOOD ON ALL FOUR SIDES SEEMED TO BE ON FIRE
3180-138043-0090 AND SHORTLY AFTER HERE THERE ON ALL SIDES A VAST NUMBER OF TRUMPETS AND OTHER MILITARY INSTRUMENTS WERE HEARD AS IF SEVERAL TROOPS OF CAVALRY WERE PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD
3180-138043-0091 THE BLAZE OF THE FIRE AND THE NOISE OF THE WARLIKE INSTRUMENTS ALMOST BLINDED THE EYES AND DEAFENED THE EARS OF THOSE THAT STOOD BY AND INDEED OF ALL WHO WERE IN THE WOOD THEN THERE WERE HEARD REPEATED LELILIES
3180-138043-0092 THE DUKE WAS ASTOUNDED THE DUCHESS AMAZED DON QUIXOTE WONDERING
3180-138043-0093 AND INDEED EVEN THEY WHO WERE AWARE OF THE CAUSE WERE FRIGHTENED
3180-138043-0094 AND A POSTILLION IN THE GUISE OF A DEMON PASSED IN FRONT OF THEM BLOWING IN LIEU OF A BUGLE A HUGE HOLLOW HORN THAT GAVE OUT A HORRIBLE HOARSE NOTE HO THERE BROTHER COURIER CRIED THE DUKE
3180-138043-0095 WHO ARE YOU WHERE ARE YOU GOING WHAT TROOPS ARE THESE THAT SEEM TO BE PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD TO WHICH THE COURIER REPLIED IN A HARSH DISCORDANT VOICE I AM THE DEVIL I AM IN SEARCH OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA
3180-138043-0096 THOSE WHO ARE COMING THIS WAY ARE SIX TROOPS OF ENCHANTERS WHO ARE BRINGING ON A TRIUMPHAL CAR THE PEERLESS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO SHE COMES UNDER ENCHANTMENT TOGETHER WITH THE GALLANT FRENCHMAN MONTESINOS
3180-138043-0097 SAID THE DUKE YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE SAID KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA FOR YOU HAVE HIM HERE BEFORE YOU
3180-138043-0098 I NEVER OBSERVED IT FOR MY MIND IS OCCUPIED WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I WAS FORGETTING THE MAIN THING I CAME ABOUT THIS DEMON MUST BE AN HONEST FELLOW AND A GOOD CHRISTIAN SAID SANCHO
3180-138043-0099 FOR IF HE WASN'T HE WOULDN'T SWEAR BY GOD AND HIS CONSCIENCE I FEEL SURE NOW THERE MUST BE GOOD SOULS EVEN IN HELL ITSELF WITHOUT DISMOUNTING THE DEMON THEN TURNED TO DON QUIXOTE AND SAID
3180-138043-0100 THE UNFORTUNATE BUT VALIANT KNIGHT MONTESINOS SENDS ME TO THEE THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS WOULD THAT I SAW THEE IN THEIR CLAWS BIDDING ME TELL THEE TO WAIT FOR HIM WHEREVER I MAY FIND THEE
3180-138043-0101 AS HE BRINGS WITH HIM HER WHOM THEY CALL DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO THAT HE MAY SHOW THEE WHAT IS NEEDFUL IN ORDER TO DISENCHANT HER AND AS I CAME FOR NO MORE I NEED STAY NO LONGER
3180-138043-0102 DEMONS OF MY SORT BE WITH THEE AND GOOD ANGELS WITH THESE GENTLES AND SO SAYING HE BLEW HIS HUGE HORN TURNED ABOUT AND WENT OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY FROM ANYONE
3180-138043-0103 THEY ALL FELT FRESH WONDER BUT PARTICULARLY SANCHO AND DON QUIXOTE SANCHO TO SEE HOW IN DEFIANCE OF THE TRUTH THEY WOULD HAVE IT THAT DULCINEA WAS ENCHANTED
3180-138043-0104 AND AS HE WAS DEEP IN THESE COGITATIONS THE DUKE SAID TO HIM DO YOU MEAN TO WAIT SENOR DON QUIXOTE WHY NOT REPLIED HE
3180-138043-0105 FEARLESS AND FIRM THOUGH ALL HELL SHOULD COME TO ATTACK ME WELL THEN IF I SEE ANOTHER DEVIL OR HEAR ANOTHER HORN LIKE THE LAST I'LL WAIT HERE AS MUCH AS IN FLANDERS SAID SANCHO
3180-138043-0106 JUST AS THOSE FIERY EXHALATIONS FROM THE EARTH THAT LOOK LIKE SHOOTING STARS TO OUR EYES FLIT THROUGH THE HEAVENS A FRIGHTFUL NOISE TOO WAS HEARD LIKE THAT MADE BY THE SOLID WHEELS THE OX CARTS USUALLY HAVE
3180-138043-0107 THERE CAME A FURTHER DISTURBANCE TO INCREASE THE TUMULT FOR NOW IT SEEMED AS IF IN TRUTH ON ALL FOUR SIDES OF THE WOOD FOUR ENCOUNTERS OR BATTLES WERE GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME
3180-138043-0108 IN ONE QUARTER RESOUNDED THE DULL NOISE OF A TERRIBLE CANNONADE IN ANOTHER NUMBERLESS MUSKETS WERE BEING DISCHARGED THE SHOUTS OF THE COMBATANTS SOUNDED ALMOST CLOSE AT HAND AND FARTHER AWAY
3180-138043-0109 IT WAS DRAWN BY FOUR PLODDING OXEN ALL COVERED WITH BLACK HOUSINGS ON EACH HORN THEY HAD FIXED A LARGE LIGHTED WAX TAPER
3180-138043-0110 ON WHICH SAT A VENERABLE OLD MAN WITH A BEARD WHITER THAN THE VERY SNOW AND SO LONG THAT IT FELL BELOW HIS WAIST HE WAS DRESSED IN A LONG ROBE OF BLACK BUCKRAM FOR AS THE CART WAS THICKLY SET WITH A MULTITUDE OF CANDLES
3180-138043-0111 AND STANDING UP SAID IN A LOUD VOICE I AM THE SAGE LIRGANDEO AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD THE CART THEN PASSED ON BEHIND IT CAME ANOTHER OF THE SAME FORM
3180-138043-0112 WITH ANOTHER AGED MAN ENTHRONED WHO STOPPING THE CART SAID IN A VOICE NO LESS SOLEMN THAN THAT OF THE FIRST I AM THE SAGE ALQUIFE THE GREAT FRIEND OF URGANDA
3180-138043-0113 THE UNKNOWN AND PASSED ON THEN ANOTHER CART CAME BY AT THE SAME PACE BUT THE OCCUPANT OF THE THRONE WAS NOT OLD LIKE THE OTHERS BUT A MAN STALWART AND ROBUST
3180-138043-0114 AND OF A FORBIDDING COUNTENANCE WHO AS HE CAME UP SAID IN A VOICE FAR HOARSER AND MORE DEVILISH
3180-138043-0115 AND SOON AFTER THEY HEARD ANOTHER NOT NOISE BUT SOUND OF SWEET HARMONIOUS MUSIC OF WHICH SANCHO WAS VERY GLAD TAKING IT TO BE A GOOD SIGN AND SAID HE TO THE DUCHESS
3180-138043-0116 FROM WHOM HE DID NOT STIR A STEP OR FOR A SINGLE INSTANT SENORA WHERE THERE'S MUSIC THERE CAN'T BE MISCHIEF NOR WHERE THERE ARE LIGHTS AND IT IS BRIGHT SAID THE DUCHESS TO WHICH SANCHO REPLIED
3180-138043-0117 FIRE GIVES LIGHT AND IT'S BRIGHT WHERE THERE ARE BONFIRES AS WE SEE BY THOSE THAT ARE ALL ROUND US AND PERHAPS MAY BURN US BUT MUSIC IS A SIGN OF MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING
