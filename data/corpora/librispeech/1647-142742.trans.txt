1647-142742-0000 THE WORD IDEALISM IS USED BY DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHERS IN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT SENSES WE SHALL UNDERSTAND BY IT THE DOCTRINE THAT WHATEVER EXISTS OR AT ANY RATE WHATEVER CAN BE KNOWN TO EXIST MUST BE IN SOME SENSE MENTAL
1647-142742-0001 THIS DOCTRINE WHICH IS VERY WIDELY HELD AMONG PHILOSOPHERS HAS SEVERAL FORMS AND IS ADVOCATED ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT GROUNDS THE DOCTRINE IS SO WIDELY HELD AND SO INTERESTING IN ITSELF THAT EVEN THE BRIEFEST SURVEY OF PHILOSOPHY MUST GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF IT
1647-142742-0002 THOSE WHO ARE UNACCUSTOMED TO PHILOSOPHICAL SPECULATION MAY BE INCLINED TO DISMISS SUCH A DOCTRINE AS OBVIOUSLY ABSURD THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT COMMON SENSE REGARDS TABLES AND CHAIRS AND THE SUN AND MOON AND MATERIAL OBJECTS GENERALLY
1647-142742-0003 AS SOMETHING RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM MINDS AND THE CONTENTS OF MINDS AND AS HAVING AN EXISTENCE WHICH MIGHT CONTINUE IF MINDS CEASED WE THINK OF MATTER AS HAVING EXISTED LONG BEFORE THERE WERE ANY MINDS
1647-142742-0004 AND IT IS HARD TO THINK OF IT AS A MERE PRODUCT OF MENTAL ACTIVITY BUT WHETHER TRUE OR FALSE IDEALISM IS NOT TO BE DISMISSED AS OBVIOUSLY ABSURD WE HAVE SEEN THAT EVEN IF PHYSICAL OBJECTS DO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE
1647-142742-0005 THEY MUST DIFFER VERY WIDELY FROM SENSE DATA AND CAN ONLY HAVE A CORRESPONDENCE WITH SENSE DATA IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY IN WHICH A CATALOGUE HAS A CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE THINGS CATALOGUED HENCE
1647-142742-0006 COMMON SENSE LEAVES US COMPLETELY IN THE DARK AS TO THE TRUE INTRINSIC NATURE OF PHYSICAL OBJECTS AND IF THERE WERE GOOD REASON TO REGARD THEM AS MENTAL WE COULD NOT LEGITIMATELY REJECT THIS OPINION MERELY BECAUSE IT STRIKES US AS STRANGE
1647-142742-0007 THE TRUTH ABOUT PHYSICAL OBJECTS MUST BE STRANGE IT MAY BE UNATTAINABLE BUT IF ANY PHILOSOPHER BELIEVES THAT HE HAS ATTAINED IT THE FACT THAT WHAT HE OFFERS AS THE TRUTH IS STRANGE OUGHT NOT TO BE MADE A GROUND OF OBJECTION TO HIS OPINION
1647-142742-0008 THE GROUNDS ON WHICH IDEALISM IS ADVOCATED ARE GENERALLY GROUNDS DERIVED FROM THE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE THAT IS TO SAY FROM A DISCUSSION OF THE CONDITIONS WHICH THINGS MUST SATISFY IN ORDER THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO KNOW THEM
1647-142742-0009 THAT OUR SENSE DATA CANNOT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN EXISTENCE INDEPENDENT OF US BUT MUST BE IN PART AT LEAST IN THE MIND IN THE SENSE THAT THEIR EXISTENCE WOULD NOT CONTINUE IF THERE WERE NO SEEING OR HEARING OR TOUCHING OR SMELLING OR TASTING
1647-142742-0010 SO FAR HIS CONTENTION WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY VALID EVEN IF SOME OF HIS ARGUMENTS WERE NOT SO BUT HE WENT ON TO ARGUE THAT SENSE DATA WERE THE ONLY THINGS OF WHOSE EXISTENCE OUR PERCEPTIONS COULD ASSURE US
1647-142742-0011 AND THAT TO BE KNOWN IS TO BE IN A MIND AND THEREFORE TO BE MENTAL HENCE HE CONCLUDED THAT NOTHING CAN EVER BE KNOWN EXCEPT WHAT IS IN SOME MIND AND THAT WHATEVER IS KNOWN WITHOUT BEING IN MY MIND MUST BE IN SOME OTHER MIND
1647-142742-0012 IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HIS ARGUMENT IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND HIS USE OF THE WORD IDEA HE GIVES THE NAME IDEA TO ANYTHING WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY KNOWN AS FOR EXAMPLE SENSE DATA ARE KNOWN
1647-142742-0013 SO IS A VOICE WHICH WE HEAR AND SO ON BUT THE TERM IS NOT WHOLLY CONFINED TO SENSE DATA
1647-142742-0014 FOR WITH SUCH THINGS ALSO WE HAVE IMMEDIATE ACQUAINTANCE AT THE MOMENT OF REMEMBERING OR IMAGINING ALL SUCH IMMEDIATE DATA HE CALLS IDEAS HE THEN PROCEEDS TO CONSIDER COMMON OBJECTS SUCH AS A TREE FOR INSTANCE
1647-142742-0015 HE SHOWS THAT ALL WE KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHEN WE PERCEIVE THE TREE CONSISTS OF IDEAS IN HIS SENSE OF THE WORD AND HE ARGUES THAT THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST GROUND FOR SUPPOSING THAT THERE IS ANYTHING REAL ABOUT THE TREE EXCEPT WHAT IS PERCEIVED
1647-142742-0016 ITS BEING HE SAYS CONSISTS IN BEING PERCEIVED IN THE LATIN OF THE SCHOOLMEN
1647-142742-0017 HE FULLY ADMITS THAT THE TREE MUST CONTINUE TO EXIST EVEN WHEN WE SHUT OUR EYES OR WHEN NO HUMAN BEING IS NEAR IT BUT THIS CONTINUED EXISTENCE HE SAYS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT GOD CONTINUES TO PERCEIVE IT
1647-142742-0018 THE REAL TREE WHICH CORRESPONDS TO WHAT WE CALLED THE PHYSICAL OBJECT CONSISTS OF IDEAS IN THE MIND OF GOD IDEAS MORE OR LESS LIKE THOSE WE HAVE WHEN WE SEE THE TREE
1647-142742-0019 BUT DIFFERING IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PERMANENT IN GOD'S MIND SO LONG AS THE TREE CONTINUES TO EXIST ALL OUR PERCEPTIONS ACCORDING TO HIM CONSIST IN A PARTIAL PARTICIPATION IN GOD'S PERCEPTIONS AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS PARTICIPATION
1647-142742-0020 THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE SEE MORE OR LESS THE SAME TREE THUS APART FROM MINDS AND THEIR IDEAS THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD NOR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ANYTHING ELSE SHOULD EVER BE KNOWN
1647-142742-0021 SINCE WHATEVER IS KNOWN IS NECESSARILY AN IDEA THERE ARE IN THIS ARGUMENT A GOOD MANY FALLACIES WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY AND WHICH IT WILL BE AS WELL TO BRING TO LIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE
1647-142742-0022 THERE IS A CONFUSION ENGENDERED BY THE USE OF THE WORD IDEA WE THINK OF AN IDEA AS ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING IN SOMEBODY'S MIND AND THUS WHEN WE ARE TOLD THAT A TREE CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF IDEAS IT IS NATURAL TO SUPPOSE THAT IF SO
1647-142742-0023 WHEN A MAN SAYS THAT SOME BUSINESS HE HAD TO ARRANGE WENT CLEAN OUT OF HIS MIND HE DOES NOT MEAN TO IMPLY THAT THE BUSINESS ITSELF WAS EVER IN HIS MIND BUT ONLY THAT A THOUGHT OF THE BUSINESS WAS FORMERLY IN HIS MIND
1647-142742-0024 BUT AFTERWARDS CEASED TO BE IN HIS MIND AND SO WHEN BERKELEY SAYS THAT THE TREE MUST BE IN OUR MINDS IF WE CAN KNOW IT ALL THAT HE REALLY HAS A RIGHT TO SAY IS THAT A THOUGHT OF THE TREE MUST BE IN OUR MINDS
1647-142742-0025 TO ARGUE THAT THE TREE ITSELF MUST BE IN OUR MINDS IS LIKE ARGUING THAT A PERSON WHOM WE BEAR IN MIND IS HIMSELF IN OUR MINDS THIS CONFUSION MAY SEEM TOO GROSS TO HAVE BEEN REALLY COMMITTED BY ANY COMPETENT PHILOSOPHER
1647-142742-0026 BUT VARIOUS ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES RENDERED IT POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO SEE HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE WE MUST GO MORE DEEPLY INTO THE QUESTION AS TO THE NATURE OF IDEAS
1647-142742-0027 BEFORE TAKING UP THE GENERAL QUESTION OF THE NATURE OF IDEAS WE MUST DISENTANGLE TWO ENTIRELY SEPARATE QUESTIONS WHICH ARISE CONCERNING SENSE DATA AND PHYSICAL OBJECTS WE SAW THAT FOR VARIOUS REASONS OF DETAIL
1647-142742-0028 BERKELEY WAS RIGHT IN TREATING THE SENSE DATA WHICH CONSTITUTE OUR PERCEPTION OF THE TREE AS MORE OR LESS SUBJECTIVE IN THE SENSE THAT THEY DEPEND UPON US AS MUCH AS UPON THE TREE AND WOULD NOT EXIST IF THE TREE WERE NOT BEING PERCEIVED
1647-142742-0029 BUT THIS IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT POINT FROM THE ONE BY WHICH BERKELEY SEEKS TO PROVE THAT WHATEVER CAN BE IMMEDIATELY KNOWN MUST BE IN A MIND FOR THIS PURPOSE ARGUMENTS OF DETAIL AS TO THE DEPENDENCE OF SENSE DATA UPON US ARE USELESS
1647-142742-0030 IT IS NECESSARY TO PROVE GENERALLY THAT BY BEING KNOWN THINGS ARE SHOWN TO BE MENTAL THIS IS WHAT BERKELEY BELIEVES HIMSELF TO HAVE DONE IT IS THIS QUESTION AND NOT OUR PREVIOUS QUESTION AS TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SENSE DATA AND THE PHYSICAL OBJECT
1647-142742-0031 THAT MUST NOW CONCERN US TAKING THE WORD IDEA IN BERKELEY'S SENSE THERE ARE TWO QUITE DISTINCT THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED WHENEVER AN IDEA IS BEFORE THE MIND THERE IS ON THE ONE HAND THE THING OF WHICH WE ARE AWARE
1647-142742-0032 BUT IS THERE ANY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THE THING APPREHENDED IS IN ANY SENSE MENTAL OUR PREVIOUS ARGUMENTS CONCERNING THE COLOUR DID NOT PROVE IT TO BE MENTAL THEY ONLY PROVED THAT ITS EXISTENCE DEPENDS UPON THE RELATION OF OUR SENSE ORGANS
1647-142742-0033 TO THE PHYSICAL OBJECT IN OUR CASE THE TABLE THAT IS TO SAY THEY PROVED THAT A CERTAIN COLOUR WILL EXIST IN A CERTAIN LIGHT IF A NORMAL EYE IS PLACED AT A CERTAIN POINT RELATIVELY TO THE TABLE
1647-142742-0034 THEN FORGETTING THAT THIS WAS ONLY TRUE WHEN IDEAS WERE TAKEN AS ACTS OF APPREHENSION WE TRANSFER THE PROPOSITION THAT IDEAS ARE IN THE MIND TO IDEAS IN THE OTHER SENSE
1647-142742-0035 THUS BY AN UNCONSCIOUS EQUIVOCATION WE ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT WHATEVER WE CAN APPREHEND MUST BE IN OUR MINDS THIS SEEMS TO BE THE TRUE ANALYSIS OF BERKELEY'S ARGUMENT AND THE ULTIMATE FALLACY UPON WHICH IT RESTS
1647-142742-0036 THIS QUESTION OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ACT AND OBJECT IN OUR APPREHENDING OF THINGS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT SINCE OUR WHOLE POWER OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE IS BOUND UP WITH IT
1647-142742-0037 IT IS THIS THAT CONSTITUTES THE MIND'S POWER OF KNOWING THINGS IF WE SAY THAT THE THINGS KNOWN MUST BE IN THE MIND WE ARE EITHER UNDULY LIMITING THE MIND'S POWER OF KNOWING OR WE ARE UTTERING A MERE TAUTOLOGY
1647-142742-0038 WE ARE UTTERING A MERE TAUTOLOGY IF WE MEAN BY IN THE MIND THE SAME AS BY BEFORE THE MIND
1647-142742-0039 IF WE MEAN MERELY BEING APPREHENDED BY THE MIND BUT IF WE MEAN THIS WE SHALL HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WHAT IN THIS SENSE IS IN THE MIND MAY NEVERTHELESS BE NOT MENTAL THUS
1647-142742-0040 WHEN WE REALIZE THE NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE BERKELEY'S ARGUMENT IS SEEN TO BE WRONG IN SUBSTANCE AS WELL AS IN FORM AND HIS GROUNDS FOR SUPPOSING THAT IDEAS' I E THE OBJECTS APPREHENDED MUST BE MENTAL ARE FOUND TO HAVE NO VALIDITY WHATEVER
1647-142742-0041 HENCE HIS GROUNDS IN FAVOUR OF IDEALISM MAY BE DISMISSED IT REMAINS TO SEE WHETHER THERE ARE ANY OTHER GROUNDS IT IS OFTEN SAID AS THOUGH IT WERE A SELF EVIDENT TRUISM
1647-142742-0042 THAT WE CANNOT KNOW THAT ANYTHING EXISTS WHICH WE DO NOT KNOW IT IS INFERRED THAT WHATEVER CAN IN ANY WAY BE RELEVANT TO OUR EXPERIENCE MUST BE AT LEAST CAPABLE OF BEING KNOWN BY US WHENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT
1647-142742-0043 IF MATTER WERE ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING WITH WHICH WE COULD NOT BECOME ACQUAINTED MATTER WOULD BE SOMETHING WHICH WE COULD NOT KNOW TO EXIST AND WHICH COULD HAVE FOR US NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER IT IS GENERALLY ALSO IMPLIED FOR REASONS WHICH REMAIN OBSCURE
1647-142742-0044 THAT WHAT CAN HAVE NO IMPORTANCE FOR US CANNOT BE REAL AND THAT THEREFORE MATTER IF IT IS NOT COMPOSED OF MINDS OR OF MENTAL IDEAS IS IMPOSSIBLE AND A MERE CHIMAERA
1647-142742-0045 TO GO INTO THIS ARGUMENT FULLY AT OUR PRESENT STAGE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE SINCE IT RAISES POINTS REQUIRING A CONSIDERABLE PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION BUT CERTAIN REASONS FOR REJECTING THE ARGUMENT MAY BE NOTICED AT ONCE
1647-142742-0046 TO BEGIN AT THE END THERE IS NO REASON WHY WHAT CANNOT HAVE ANY PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE FOR US SHOULD NOT BE REAL IT IS TRUE THAT IF THEORETICAL IMPORTANCE IS INCLUDED
1647-142742-0047 EVERYTHING REAL IS OF SOME IMPORTANCE TO US SINCE AS PERSONS DESIROUS OF KNOWING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE UNIVERSE WE HAVE SOME INTEREST IN EVERYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE CONTAINS BUT IF THIS SORT OF INTEREST IS INCLUDED
1647-142742-0048 IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT MATTER HAS NO IMPORTANCE FOR US PROVIDED IT EXISTS EVEN IF WE CANNOT KNOW THAT IT EXISTS WE CAN OBVIOUSLY SUSPECT THAT IT MAY EXIST AND WONDER WHETHER IT DOES HENCE IT IS CONNECTED WITH OUR DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE
1647-142742-0049 AND HAS THE IMPORTANCE OF EITHER SATISFYING OR THWARTING THIS DESIRE AGAIN IT IS BY NO MEANS A TRUISM AND IS IN FACT FALSE THAT WE CANNOT KNOW THAT ANYTHING EXISTS WHICH WE DO NOT KNOW THE WORD KNOW
1647-142742-0050 IS HERE USED IN TWO DIFFERENT SENSES ONE IN ITS FIRST USE IT IS APPLICABLE TO THE SORT OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS OPPOSED TO ERROR THE SENSE IN WHICH WHAT WE KNOW IS TRUE THE SENSE WHICH APPLIES TO OUR BELIEFS AND CONVICTIONS
1647-142742-0051 TO WHAT ARE CALLED JUDGEMENTS IN THIS SENSE OF THE WORD WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS THE CASE THIS SORT OF KNOWLEDGE MAY BE DESCRIBED AS KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTHS TWO IN THE SECOND USE OF THE WORD KNOW ABOVE
1647-142742-0052 THE WORD APPLIES TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS WHICH WE MAY CALL ACQUAINTANCE THIS IS THE SENSE IN WHICH WE KNOW SENSE DATA THE DISTINCTION INVOLVED IS ROUGHLY THAT BETWEEN SAVOIR
1647-142742-0053 AND KENNEN IN GERMAN THUS THE STATEMENT WHICH SEEMED LIKE A TRUISM BECOMES WHEN RE STATED THE FOLLOWING WE CAN NEVER TRULY JUDGE THAT SOMETHING WITH WHICH WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED EXISTS
1647-142742-0054 THIS IS BY NO MEANS A TRUISM BUT ON THE CONTRARY A PALPABLE FALSEHOOD I HAVE NOT THE HONOUR TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE EMPEROR OF CHINA BUT I TRULY JUDGE THAT HE EXISTS
1647-142742-0055 IT MAY BE SAID OF COURSE THAT I JUDGE THIS BECAUSE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM THIS HOWEVER WOULD BE AN IRRELEVANT RETORT SINCE IF THE PRINCIPLE WERE TRUE I COULD NOT KNOW THAT ANY ONE ELSE IS ACQUAINTED WITH HIM BUT FURTHER
1647-142742-0056 THERE IS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF SOMETHING WITH WHICH NOBODY IS ACQUAINTED THIS POINT IS IMPORTANT AND DEMANDS ELUCIDATION IF I AM ACQUAINTED WITH A THING WHICH EXISTS
1647-142742-0057 MY ACQUAINTANCE GIVES ME THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT EXISTS BUT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT CONVERSELY WHENEVER I CAN KNOW THAT A THING OF A CERTAIN SORT EXISTS I OR SOME ONE ELSE MUST BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE THING
1647-142742-0058 WHAT HAPPENS IN CASES WHERE I HAVE TRUE JUDGEMENT WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE IS THAT THE THING IS KNOWN TO ME BY DESCRIPTION AND THAT IN VIRTUE OF SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLE THE EXISTENCE OF A THING ANSWERING TO THIS DESCRIPTION CAN BE INFERRED
1647-142742-0059 FROM THE EXISTENCE OF SOMETHING WITH WHICH I AM ACQUAINTED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS POINT FULLY IT WILL BE WELL FIRST TO DEAL WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE AND KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION
1647-142742-0060 AND THEN TO CONSIDER WHAT KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES IF ANY HAS THE SAME KIND OF CERTAINTY AS OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF OUR OWN EXPERIENCES
