8808-283205-0001 AND CLOSELY QUESTIONED HER WHETHER THE EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE HAD NOT BEEN OCCASIONED BY SOME IMPRUDENCE OF HER OWN BUT SHE POSITIVELY DENIED THE CHARGE ALLEGING THAT SHE HAD PARTED WITH THE KING SCARCELY AN HOUR BEFORE ON TERMS OF THE MOST PERFECT AMITY
8808-283205-0002 AND WITH THE FULL CONVICTION THAT SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE CARDINAL'S RUIN

8808-283205-0038 I WISH SUCH ANOTHER CHANCE OF CAPTURING THE FIEND WOULD OCCUR TO ME AS THE WORDS WERE UTTERED THE DOOR OF A RECESS WAS THROWN SUDDENLY OPEN AND HERNE IN HIS WILD GARB WITH HIS ANTLERED HELM UPON HIS BROW AND THE RUSTY CHAIN DEPENDING FROM HIS LEFT ARM STOOD BEFORE THEM
8808-283205-0039 HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO TERRIFIC AND UNEARTHLY THAT THEY ALL SHRANK AGHAST AND MAT BEE FELL WITH HIS FACE ON THE FLOOR I AM HERE CRIED THE DEMON NOW BRAGGART WILT DARE TO SEIZE ME BUT NOT A HAND WAS MOVED AGAINST HIM THE WHOLE PARTY SEEMED TRANSFIXED WITH TERROR

8808-283205-0043 AS SOON AS THEY RECOVERED FROM THE FRIGHT THAT HAD ENCHAINED THEM SHOREDITCH AND PADDINGTON RUSHED FORTH INTO THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE TURRET
8808-283205-0044 A PIECE OF INFORMATION WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER SUPERFLUOUS AS THE HAMMERING HAD RECOMMENCED AND CONTINUED TILL THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE WHEN IT STOPPED JUST THEN IT OCCURRED TO MAT BEE TO RING THE ALARM BELL AND HE SEIZED THE ROPE AND BEGAN TO PULL IT
8808-283205-0045 BUT THE BELL HAD SCARCELY SOUNDED WHEN THE CORD SEVERED FROM ABOVE FELL UPON HIS HEAD AT THIS JUNCTURE THE KING AND THE DUKE OF SUFFOLK ARRIVED WHEN TOLD WHAT HAD HAPPENED THOUGH PREPARED FOR IT HENRY BURST INTO A TERRIBLE PASSION AND BESTOWED A BUFFET ON MAT BEE
8808-283205-0046 THAT WELL NIGH BROKE HIS JAW AND SENT HIM REELING TO THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE CHAMBER HE HAD NOT AT FIRST UNDERSTOOD THAT HERNE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE UPPER ROOM BUT AS SOON AS HE WAS MADE AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE HE CRIED OUT AH DASTARDS HAVE YOU LET HIM BRAVE YOU THUS BUT I AM GLAD OF IT
8808-283205-0047 DO NOT EXPOSE YOURSELF TO THIS RISK MY GRACIOUS LIEGE SAID SUFFOLK WHAT ARE YOU TOO A SHARER IN THEIR WOMANISH FEARS SUFFOLK CRIED HENRY I THOUGHT YOU HAD BEEN MADE OF STOUTER STUFF IF THERE IS DANGER I SHALL BE THE FIRST TO ENCOUNTER IT
8808-283205-0048 COME HE ADDED SNATCHING A TORCH FROM AN ARQUEBUSIER AND DRAWING HIS DAG HE HURRIED UP THE STEEP STEPS WHILE SUFFOLK FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE
8808-283205-0049 MEANWHILE SHOREDITCH AND PADDINGTON RAN OUT AND INFORMED BOUCHIER THAT THE KING HAD ARRIVED AND WAS MOUNTING IN SEARCH OF HERNE UPON WHICH THE CAPTAIN SHAKING OFF HIS FEARS ORDERED HIS MEN TO FOLLOW HIM
8808-283205-0050 BEGAN CAUTIOUSLY TO DESCEND FEELING HIS WAY WITH HIS SWORD
8808-283205-0051 THE LIGHT OF THE TORCH FELL UPON THE GHOSTLY FIGURE OF HERNE WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED UPON HIS BREAST STANDING NEAR THE PILE OF WOOD LYING BETWEEN THE TWO STAIRCASES SO APPALLING WAS THE APPEARANCE OF THE DEMON THAT HENRY STOOD STILL TO GAZE AT HIM
8808-283205-0052 IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE DUKE OF SUFFOLK HAD GAINED THE PLATFORM
8808-283205-0053 THOU ART HEMMED IN ON ALL SIDES AND CANST NOT ESCAPE HO HO HO LAUGHED HERNE THIS SHALL PROVE WHETHER THOU ART HUMAN OR NOT CRIED HENRY TAKING DELIBERATE AIM AT HIM WITH THE DAG HO HO HO LAUGHED HERNE AND AS THE REPORT RANG THROUGH THE ROOM
8808-283205-0054 HE SANK THROUGH THE FLOOR AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW GONE EXCLAIMED HENRY AS THE SMOKE CLEARED OFF GONE HOLY MARY THEN IT MUST INDEED BE THE FIEND I MADE THE MIDDLE OF HIS SKULL MY AIM
8808-283205-0055 AND IF HE HAD NOT BEEN INVULNERABLE THE BULLET MUST HAVE PIERCED HIS BRAIN I HEARD IT REBOUND FROM HIS HORNED HELMET AND DROP TO THE FLOOR SAID BOUCHIER WHAT IS THAT CHEST CRIED HENRY POINTING TO A STRANGE COFFIN SHAPED BOX LYING AS IT SEEMED ON THE EXACT SPOT WHERE THE DEMON HAD DISAPPEARED
8808-283205-0056 NO ONE HAD SEEN IT BEFORE THOUGH ALL CALLED TO MIND THE MYSTERIOUS HAMMERING AND THEY HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE COFFIN WAS THE WORK OF THE DEMON BREAK IT OPEN CRIED HENRY FOR AUGHT WE KNOW HERNE MAY BE CONCEALED WITHIN IT THE ORDER WAS RELUCTANTLY OBEYED BY THE ARQUEBUSIERS
8808-283205-0057 BUT NO FORCE WAS REQUIRED FOR THE LID WAS NOT NAILED DOWN AND WHEN IT WAS REMOVED A HUMAN BODY IN THE LAST STAGE OF DECAY WAS DISCOVERED PAH CLOSE IT UP CRIED HENRY TURNING AWAY IN DISGUST HOW CAME IT THERE
8808-283205-0058 NO SUCH COFFIN WAS HERE WHEN I SEARCHED THE CHAMBER TWO HOURS AGO BUT SEE HE SUDDENLY ADDED STOOPING DOWN AND PICKING UP A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH HAD FALLEN FROM THE COFFIN HERE IS A SCROLL GIVE IT ME CRIED HENRY
8808-283205-0059 AND HOLDING IT TO THE LIGHT HE READ THE WORDS THE BODY OF MARK FYTTON THE BUTCHER THE VICTIM OF A TYRANT'S CRUELTY
