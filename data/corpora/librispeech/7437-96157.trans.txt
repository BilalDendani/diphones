7437-96157-0000 WHICH INCREASED AS I ADVANCED MOST OF THEM SMALL BOATS WITH SOME SCHOONERS SLOOPS AND LARGER CRAFT THE MAJORITY A GROUND AND SUDDENLY NOW I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MINGLING WITH THAT DELICIOUS ODOUR OF SPRING BLOSSOMS PROFOUNDLY MODIFYING YET NOT DESTROYING IT
7437-96157-0001 I RAN AND STOPPED THE ENGINES AND WITHOUT ANCHORING GOT DOWN INTO AN EMPTY BOAT THAT LAY AT THE SHIP'S SIDE WHEN SHE STOPPED AND I PADDLED TWENTY YARDS TOWARD THE LITTLE QUAY THERE WAS A BRIGANTINE WITH ALL HER COURSES SET THREE JIBS STAY SAILS
7437-96157-0002 AND TEN OR TWELVE SHALLOPS AND THE SAILING CRAFT HAD ALL FORE AND AFT SAILS SET AND ABOUT EACH AS I PASSED AMONG THEM BROODED AN ODOUR THAT WAS BOTH SWEET AND ABHORRENT AN ODOUR MORE SUGGESTIVE OF THE VERY GENIUS OF MORTALITY
7437-96157-0003 AND CORD TROUSERS WITH A BELT AND A CLOTH CAP OVER MY LONG HAIR AND AN OLD PAIR OF YELLOW SHOES WITHOUT LACES AND WITHOUT SOCKS AND I STOOD ON THE UNHEWN STONES OF THE EDGE OF THE QUAY AND LOOKED ABROAD OVER A LARGISH PIECE OF UNPAVED GROUND
7437-96157-0004 WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE FIRST HOUSE ROW AND THE QUAY WHAT I SAW WAS NOT ONLY MOST WOEFUL BUT WILDLY STARTLING WOEFUL BECAUSE A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE HAD ASSEMBLED AND LAY DEAD THERE
7437-96157-0005 AND THE SOMETHING WHICH TOLD ME THIS WAS A CERTAIN FOREIGN AIR ABOUT THAT FIELD OF THE DEAD AS THE EYE RESTED ON IT SOMETHING UN NORTHERN SOUTHERN AND ORIENTAL TWO YARDS FROM MY FEET AS I STEPPED TO THE TOP LAY A GROUP OF THREE
7437-96157-0006 ONE A NORWAY PEASANT GIRL IN SKIRT OF OLIVE GREEN SCARLET STOMACHER EMBROIDERED BODICE SCOTCH BONNET TRIMMED WITH SILVER LACE AND BIG SILVER SHOE BUCKLES THE SECOND WAS AN OLD NORWAY MAN IN KNEE BREECHES
7437-96157-0007 AND THE THIRD WAS I DECIDED AN OLD JEW OF THE POLISH PALE IN GABERDINE AND SKULL CAP WITH EAR LOCKS I WENT NEARER TO WHERE THEY LAY THICK AS REAPED STUBBLE BETWEEN THE QUAY AND A LITTLE STONE FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPACE
7437-96157-0008 AND I SAW AMONG THOSE NORTHERN DEAD TWO DARK SKINNED WOMEN IN COSTLY DRESS EITHER SPANISH OR ITALIAN AND THE YELLOWER MORTALITY OF A MONGOLIAN PROBABLY A MAGYAR
7437-96157-0009 AND SOME TWENTY FIVE OBVIOUS FRENCH
7437-96157-0010 NORTHWARD AND WESTWARD OF ALL THE TRIBES OF MAN AND THIS THAT I ADAM JEFFSON HERE SEE IS BUT THE FAR TOSSED SPRAY OF THAT MONSTROUS INFURIATE FLOOD WELL I PASSED UP A STREET BEFORE ME
7437-96157-0011 BUT I PACED ON WITHOUT STOPPAGE TRAVERSED SEVERAL STREETS AND CAME OUT AS IT BECAME DARK UPON A PIECE OF GRASS LAND LEADING DOWNWARD TO A MOUNTAIN GORGE IT WAS SOME DISTANCE ALONG THIS GORGE THAT I FOUND MYSELF SITTING THE NEXT MORNING AND HOW
7437-96157-0012 AND IN WHAT TRANCE I PASSED THAT WHOLE BLANK NIGHT IS OBLITERATED FROM MY CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN I LOOKED ABOUT WITH THE RETURN OF LIGHT I SAW MAJESTIC FIR GROWN MOUNTAINS ON EITHER HAND ALMOST MEETING OVERHEAD AT SOME POINTS DEEPLY SHADING THE MOSSY GORGE
7437-96157-0013 AND LUXURIANCE OF VERDURE AND A NOISE OF WATERS OCCASIONALLY I SAW LITTLE CATARACTS ON HIGH FLUTTERING LIKE WHITE WILD RAGS FOR THEY BROKE IN THE MID FALL AND WERE CAUGHT AWAY AND SCATTERED PATCHES
7437-96157-0014 I HAD NO THOUGHT OF ENTERING ANY HOUSE BUT AS I PASSED BY ONE OPEN PORTE COCHERE SOMETHING I KNOW NOT WHAT MADE ME TURN SHARPLY IN FOR MY MIND HAD BECOME AS FLUFF ON THE WINDS NOT WORKING OF ITS OWN ACTION BUT THE SPORT OF IMPULSES THAT SEEMED EXTERNAL
7437-96157-0015 I WENT ACROSS THE YARD AND ASCENDED A WOODEN SPIRAL STAIR BY A TWILIGHT WHICH JUST ENABLED ME TO PICK MY WAY AMONG FIVE OR SIX VAGUE FORMS FALLEN THERE IN THAT CONFINED PLACE FANTASTIC QUALMS BESET ME
7437-96157-0016 I MOUNTED TO THE SECOND THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND WITH A CHILL RELUCTANCE I TOOK A STEP INWARD WHERE ALL WAS PITCH DARKNESS THE WINDOW STORES BEING DRAWN I HESITATED IT WAS VERY DARK
7437-96157-0017 A MIGHTY AND WIDE SPREAD FLEET OVER ALL THAT GREAT EXPANSE OF THE NORTH SEA WHERE IN ITS MOST POPULOUS DAYS OF TRADE THE SAILOR MIGHT PERHAPS SIGHT A SAIL OR TWO I HAD NOW AT EVERY MOMENT AT LEAST TEN OR TWELVE WITHIN SCOPE OF THE GLASS
7437-96157-0018 EXTREMELY SLOW WAS MY ADVANCE FOR AT FIRST I WOULD NOT LEAVE ANY SHIP HOWEVER REMOTELY SMALL WITHOUT APPROACHING SUFFICIENTLY TO INVESTIGATE HER AT LEAST WITH THE SPY GLASS AND A STRANGE MULTITUDINOUS MIXTURE OF SPECIES THEY WERE
7437-96157-0019 TRAWLERS IN HOSTS WAR SHIPS OF EVERY NATION USED IT SEEMED AS PASSENGER BOATS SMACKS FELUCCAS LINERS STEAM BARGES GREAT FOUR MASTERS WITH SAILS CHANNEL BOATS LUGGERS
7437-96157-0020 MARSEILLES FISHERS A MALTESE SPERONARE AMERICAN OFF SHORE SAIL MISSISSIPPI STEAM BOATS SORRENTO LUG SCHOONERS RHINE PUNTS YAWLS
7437-96157-0021 AND SO FAIR WAS THE WORLD ABOUT THEM TOO THE BRIGHTEST SUAVEST AUTUMN WEATHER ALL THE STILL AIR AROMATIC WITH THAT VERNAL PERFUME OF PEACH YET NOT SO UTTERLY STILL BUT IF I PASSED CLOSE TO THE LEE OF ANY FLOATING THING
7437-96157-0022 VAGUE AS WAS THE OFFENCE THAT I BEGAN TO SHUN RATHER THAN SEEK THE SHIPS AND ALSO I NOW DROPPED MY TWELVE
7437-96157-0023 ONE BY ONE INTO THE SEA FOR NOW I HAD DEFINITELY PASSED INTO A ZONE OF SETTLED WARMTH I WAS CONVINCED HOWEVER THAT THE POISON WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE HAD SOME EMBALMING OR ANTISEPTIC EFFECT UPON THE BODIES
7437-96157-0024 HIERARCHIES WARRING FOR THE UNIVERSE
7437-96157-0025 FOR I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THE GREAT SUN SETS OF THE LATER NINETEENTH CENTURY WITNESSED IN EUROPE AMERICA AND I BELIEVE OVER THE WORLD AFTER THE ERUPTION OF THE VOLCANO OF KRAKATOA AND WHEREAS I HAD BEFORE SAID TO MYSELF
7437-96157-0026 IF NOW A WAVE FROM THE DEEP HAS WASHED OVER THIS PLANETARY SHIP OF EARTH I SAID NOW A WAVE BUT NOT FROM THE DEEP A WAVE RATHER WHICH SHE HAD RESERVED AND HAS SPOUTED FROM HER OWN UN MOTHERLY ENTRAILS
7437-96157-0027 I HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE OF MORSE TELEGRAPHY AND OF THE MANIPULATION OF TAPE MACHINES TELEGRAPHIC TYPING MACHINES AND THE ORDINARY WIRELESS TRANSMITTER AND COHERER AS OF MOST LITTLE THINGS OF THAT SORT WHICH CAME WITHIN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE INTEREST OF A MAN OF SCIENCE
