483-125126-0014 ALONE BOB'S REAPPEARANCE WITH A STEAMING JUG BROKE OFF THE CONVERSATION BUT ALTHOUGH THE JUG STEAMED FORTH A DELICIOUS PERFUME ITS CONTENTS HAD NOT RECEIVED THAT LAST HAPPY TOUCH WHICH THE SURPASSING FINISH OF THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS IMPARTED ON SUCH MOMENTOUS OCCASIONS
483-125126-0015 BOB CARRIED IN HIS LEFT HAND ONE OF THOSE IRON MODELS OF SUGAR LOAF HATS BEFORE MENTIONED INTO WHICH HE EMPTIED THE JUG AND THE POINTED END OF WHICH HE THRUST DEEP DOWN INTO THE FIRE SO LEAVING IT FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHILE HE DISAPPEARED AND REAPPEARED WITH THREE BRIGHT DRINKING GLASSES
483-125126-0016 PLACING THESE ON THE TABLE AND BENDING OVER THE FIRE MERITORIOUSLY SENSIBLE OF THE TRYING NATURE OF HIS DUTY HE WATCHED THE WREATHS OF STEAM
483-125126-0017 CAUSING IT TO SEND FORTH ONE GENTLE HISS THEN HE RESTORED THE CONTENTS TO THE JUG HELD OVER THE STEAM OF THE JUG EACH OF THE THREE BRIGHT GLASSES IN SUCCESSION FINALLY FILLED THEM ALL AND WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AWAITED THE APPLAUSE OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES IT WAS BESTOWED
483-125126-0018 MISTER INSPECTOR HAVING PROPOSED AS AN APPROPRIATE SENTIMENT THE LIME TRADE AND BOB WITHDREW TO REPORT THE COMMENDATIONS OF THE GUESTS TO MISS ABBEY IN THE BAR
483-125126-0019 ONLY IT HAD BEEN REGARDED BY MISTER INSPECTOR AS SO UNCOMMONLY SATISFACTORY AND SO FRAUGHT WITH MYSTERIOUS VIRTUES THAT NEITHER OF HIS CLIENTS HAD PRESUMED TO QUESTION IT TWO TAPS WERE NOW HEARD ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW
483-125126-0020 MISTER INSPECTOR HASTILY FORTIFYING HIMSELF WITH ANOTHER GLASS STROLLED OUT WITH A NOISELESS FOOT AND AN UNOCCUPIED COUNTENANCE AS ONE MIGHT GO TO SURVEY THE WEATHER AND THE GENERAL ASPECT OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES THIS IS BECOMING GRIM MORTIMER SAID EUGENE IN A LOW VOICE

483-125126-0023 DIVESTED OF ITS VARIOUS LIME LIGHTS AND SHADOWS HIS REPORT WENT TO THE EFFECT THAT GAFFER WAS AWAY IN HIS BOAT SUPPOSED TO BE ON HIS OLD LOOK OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED LAST HIGH WATER
483-125126-0024 THAT HAVING MISSED IT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER HE WAS NOT ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL HABITS AT NIGHT TO BE COUNTED ON BEFORE NEXT HIGH WATER OR IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR OR SO LATER THAT HIS DAUGHTER SURVEYED THROUGH THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO BE SO EXPECTING HIM FOR THE SUPPER WAS NOT COOKING BUT SET OUT READY TO BE COOKED
483-125126-0025 THAT IT WOULD BE HIGH WATER AT ABOUT ONE AND THAT IT WAS NOW BARELY TEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT WATCH AND WAIT THAT THE INFORMER WAS KEEPING WATCH AT THE INSTANT OF THAT PRESENT REPORTING BUT THAT TWO HEADS WERE BETTER THAN ONE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SECOND WAS MISTER INSPECTOR'S
483-125126-0026 AND FORASMUCH AS CROUCHING UNDER THE LEE OF A HAULED UP BOAT ON A NIGHT WHEN IT BLEW COLD AND STRONG AND WHEN THE WEATHER WAS VARIED WITH BLASTS OF HAIL AT TIMES
483-125126-0027 THEY WERE NOT INCLINED TO DISPUTE THIS RECOMMENDATION BUT THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THEY COULD JOIN THE WATCHERS WHEN SO DISPOSED RATHER THAN TRUST TO A VERBAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PLACE WHICH MIGHT MISLEAD
483-125126-0028 EUGENE WITH A LESS WEIGHTY SENSE OF PERSONAL TROUBLE ON HIM THAN HE USUALLY HAD WOULD GO OUT WITH MISTER INSPECTOR NOTE THE SPOT AND COME BACK ON THE SHELVING BANK OF THE RIVER AMONG THE SLIMY STONES OF A CAUSEWAY
483-125126-0029 NOT THE SPECIAL CAUSEWAY OF THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIPS WHICH HAD A LANDING PLACE OF ITS OWN BUT ANOTHER A LITTLE REMOVED AND VERY NEAR TO THE OLD WINDMILL WHICH WAS THE DENOUNCED MAN'S DWELLING PLACE WERE A FEW BOATS SOME MOORED AND ALREADY BEGINNING TO FLOAT OTHERS HAULED UP ABOVE THE REACH OF THE TIDE
483-125126-0030 UNDER ONE OF THESE LATTER EUGENE'S COMPANION DISAPPEARED
483-125126-0031 HE COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE SHINING THROUGH THE WINDOW PERHAPS IT DREW HIM ON TO LOOK IN PERHAPS HE HAD COME OUT WITH THE EXPRESS INTENTION
483-125126-0032 THAT PART OF THE BANK HAVING RANK GRASS GROWING ON IT THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING CLOSE WITHOUT ANY NOISE OF FOOTSTEPS IT WAS BUT TO SCRAMBLE UP A RAGGED FACE OF PRETTY HARD MUD SOME THREE OR FOUR FEET HIGH AND COME UPON THE GRASS AND TO THE WINDOW HE CAME TO THE WINDOW BY THAT MEANS
483-125126-0033 SHE HAD NO OTHER LIGHT THAN THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE THE UNKINDLED LAMP STOOD ON THE TABLE SHE SAT ON THE GROUND LOOKING AT THE BRAZIER WITH HER FACE LEANING ON HER HAND
483-125126-0034 THERE WAS A KIND OF FILM OR FLICKER ON HER FACE WHICH AT FIRST HE TOOK TO BE THE FITFUL FIRELIGHT BUT ON A SECOND LOOK HE SAW THAT SHE WAS WEEPING A SAD AND SOLITARY SPECTACLE AS SHOWN HIM BY THE RISING AND THE FALLING OF THE FIRE
483-125126-0035 IT WAS A LITTLE WINDOW OF BUT FOUR PIECES OF GLASS AND WAS NOT CURTAINED HE CHOSE IT BECAUSE THE LARGER WINDOW NEAR IT WAS IT SHOWED HIM THE ROOM AND THE BILLS UPON THE WALL RESPECTING THE DROWNED PEOPLE STARTING OUT AND RECEDING BY TURNS
483-125126-0036 BUT HE GLANCED SLIGHTLY AT THEM THOUGH HE LOOKED LONG AND STEADILY AT HER
483-125126-0037 SHE STARTED UP HE HAD BEEN SO VERY STILL THAT HE FELT SURE IT WAS NOT HE WHO HAD DISTURBED HER SO MERELY WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW AND STOOD NEAR IT IN THE SHADOW OF THE WALL SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID IN AN ALARMED TONE FATHER WAS THAT YOU CALLING ME
483-125126-0038 AND AGAIN FATHER AND ONCE AGAIN AFTER LISTENING FATHER I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU CALL ME TWICE BEFORE
483-125126-0039 NO RESPONSE AS SHE RE ENTERED AT THE DOOR HE DROPPED OVER THE BANK AND MADE HIS WAY BACK AMONG THE OOZE AND NEAR THE HIDING PLACE TO MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD TO WHOM HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN OF THE GIRL AND HOW THIS WAS BECOMING VERY GRIM INDEED
483-125126-0040 IF THE REAL MAN FEELS AS GUILTY AS I DO SAID EUGENE HE IS REMARKABLY UNCOMFORTABLE INFLUENCE OF SECRECY SUGGESTED LIGHTWOOD
483-125126-0041 GIVE ME SOME MORE OF THAT STUFF

483-125126-0044 FOR THE JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS ARE NOT THE JOLLIEST DOGS I HAVE KNOWN BUT I SUPPOSE WE ARE BEST HERE UNTIL THEY TURN US OUT WITH THE OTHER SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS AT MIDNIGHT
483-125126-0045 I AM QUITE AS BAD SAID LIGHTWOOD SITTING UP FACING HIM WITH A TUMBLED HEAD AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME WONDERFUL EVOLUTIONS IN WHICH HIS HEAD HAD BEEN THE LOWEST PART OF HIM THIS RESTLESSNESS BEGAN WITH ME LONG AGO
483-125126-0046 IT WON'T DO MORTIMER WE MUST GET INTO THE AIR WE MUST JOIN OUR DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER RIDERHOOD
483-125126-0047 NEXT TIME WITH A VIEW TO OUR PEACE OF MIND WE'LL COMMIT THE CRIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE CRIMINAL YOU SWEAR IT CERTAINLY SWORN LET TIPPINS LOOK TO IT HER LIFE'S IN DANGER
483-125126-0048 MORTIMER RANG THE BELL TO PAY THE SCORE AND BOB APPEARED TO TRANSACT THAT BUSINESS WITH HIM WHOM EUGENE IN HIS CARELESS EXTRAVAGANCE ASKED IF HE WOULD LIKE A SITUATION IN THE LIME TRADE THANKEE SIR NO SIR SAID BOB I'VE A GOOD SITIWATION HERE SIR
483-125126-0049 IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AT ANY TIME RETURNED EUGENE COME TO ME AT MY WORKS AND YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND AN OPENING IN THE LIME KILN THANKEE SIR SAID BOB THIS IS MY PARTNER
483-125126-0050 SAID EUGENE WHO KEEPS THE BOOKS AND ATTENDS TO THE WAGES A FAIR DAY'S WAGES FOR A FAIR DAY'S WORK IS EVER MY PARTNER'S MOTTO AND A VERY GOOD UN IT IS GENTLEMEN
483-125126-0051 MORTIMER APOSTROPHIZED HIM LAUGHING QUITE HEARTILY WHEN THEY WERE ALONE AGAIN HOW CAN YOU BE SO RIDICULOUS I AM IN A RIDICULOUS HUMOUR QUOTH EUGENE I AM A RIDICULOUS FELLOW EVERYTHING IS RIDICULOUS COME ALONG
483-125126-0052 IT PASSED INTO MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD'S MIND THAT A CHANGE OF SOME SORT BEST EXPRESSED PERHAPS AS AN INTENSIFICATION OF ALL THAT WAS WILDEST AND MOST NEGLIGENT AND RECKLESS IN HIS FRIEND HAD COME UPON HIM IN THE LAST HALF HOUR OR SO
483-125126-0053 THOROUGHLY USED TO HIM AS HE WAS HE FOUND SOMETHING NEW AND STRAINED IN HIM THAT WAS FOR THE MOMENT PERPLEXING THIS PASSED INTO HIS MIND AND PASSED OUT AGAIN BUT HE REMEMBERED IT AFTERWARDS
483-125126-0054 SAID EUGENE WHEN THEY WERE STANDING UNDER THE BANK ROARED AND RIVEN AT BY THE WIND THERE'S THE LIGHT OF HER FIRE I'LL TAKE A PEEP THROUGH THE WINDOW
483-125126-0055 COME TO OUR HONEST FRIEND HE LED HIM TO THE POST OF WATCH AND THEY BOTH DROPPED DOWN AND CREPT UNDER THE LEE OF THE BOAT
483-125126-0056 HERE I AM SIR AND OUR FRIEND OF THE PERSPIRING BROW IS AT THE FAR CORNER THERE GOOD ANYTHING HAPPENED HIS DAUGHTER HAS BEEN OUT THINKING SHE HEARD HIM CALLING UNLESS IT WAS A SIGN TO HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
483-125126-0057 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN RULE BRITANNIA MUTTERED EUGENE BUT IT WASN'T MORTIMER HERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MISTER INSPECTOR TWO BURGLARIES NOW AND A FORGERY
483-125126-0058 WITH THIS INDICATION OF HIS DEPRESSED STATE OF MIND EUGENE FELL SILENT THEY WERE ALL SILENT FOR A LONG WHILE AS IT GOT TO BE FLOOD TIDE AND THE WATER CAME NEARER TO THEM NOISES ON THE RIVER BECAME MORE FREQUENT AND THEY LISTENED MORE
483-125126-0059 TO THE TURNING OF STEAM PADDLES TO THE CLINKING OF IRON CHAIN TO THE CREAKING OF BLOCKS TO THE MEASURED WORKING OF OARS TO THE OCCASIONAL VIOLENT BARKING OF SOME PASSING DOG ON SHIPBOARD WHO SEEMED TO SCENT THEM LYING IN THEIR HIDING PLACE
483-125126-0060 THE NIGHT WAS NOT SO DARK BUT THAT BESIDES THE LIGHTS AT BOWS AND MASTHEADS GLIDING TO AND FRO THEY COULD DISCERN SOME SHADOWY BULK ATTACHED AND NOW AND THEN A GHOSTLY LIGHTER WITH A LARGE DARK SAIL LIKE A WARNING ARM WOULD START UP VERY NEAR THEM PASS ON AND VANISH
483-125126-0061 AT THIS TIME OF THEIR WATCH THE WATER CLOSE TO THEM WOULD BE OFTEN AGITATED BY SOME IMPULSION GIVEN IT FROM A DISTANCE
483-125126-0062 BUT FOR THE IMMOBILITY WITH WHICH THE INFORMER WELL USED TO THE RIVER KEPT QUIET IN HIS PLACE
483-125126-0063 BUT THERE WERE BELLS TO WINDWARD THAT TOLD THEM OF ITS BEING ONE TWO THREE WITHOUT THAT AID THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW THE NIGHT WORE BY THE FALLING OF THE TIDE RECORDED IN THE APPEARANCE OF AN EVER WIDENING BLACK WET STRIP OF SHORE
483-125126-0064 AS THE TIME SO PASSED THIS SLINKING BUSINESS BECAME A MORE AND MORE PRECARIOUS ONE
483-125126-0065 HIS MOVEMENTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLANNED TO GAIN FOR HIM IN GETTING BEYOND THEIR REACH TWELVE HOURS ADVANTAGE THE HONEST MAN WHO HAD EXPENDED THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW BECAME UNEASY AND BEGAN TO COMPLAIN WITH BITTERNESS OF THE PRONENESS OF MANKIND TO CHEAT HIM HIM INVESTED WITH THE DIGNITY OF LABOUR
483-125126-0066 THEIR RETREAT WAS SO CHOSEN THAT WHILE THEY COULD WATCH THE RIVER THEY COULD WATCH THE HOUSE NO ONE HAD PASSED IN OR OUT SINCE THE DAUGHTER THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE FATHER CALLING NO ONE COULD PASS IN OR OUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BUT IT WILL BE LIGHT AT FIVE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
483-125126-0067 AND THEN WE SHALL BE SEEN LOOK HERE SAID RIDERHOOD WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS HE MAY HAVE BEEN LURKING IN AND OUT AND JUST HOLDING HIS OWN BETWIXT TWO OR THREE BRIDGES FOR HOURS BACK WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR

483-125126-0069 AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF YOUR BOAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR WHAT IF I PUT OFF IN HER AND TAKE A LOOK ROUND
483-125126-0070 YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A WORSE OPINION SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AFTER BRIEF CONSIDERATION TRY IT STOP A BIT LET'S WORK IT OUT IF I WANT YOU I'LL DROP ROUND UNDER THE FELLOWSHIPS AND TIP YOU A WHISTLE
483-125126-0071 IF I MIGHT SO FAR PRESUME AS TO OFFER A SUGGESTION TO MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND WHOSE KNOWLEDGE OF NAVAL MATTERS FAR BE IT FROM ME TO IMPEACH EUGENE STRUCK IN WITH GREAT DELIBERATION
483-125126-0072 MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND WILL I TRUST EXCUSE ME AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER FOR THROWING OUT A REMARK WHICH I FEEL TO BE DUE TO THIS HOUSE AND THE COUNTRY WAS THAT THE T'OTHER GOVERNOR OR LAWYER LIGHTWOOD ASKED RIDERHOOD
483-125126-0073 FOR THEY SPOKE AS THEY CROUCHED OR LAY WITHOUT SEEING ONE ANOTHER'S FACES IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION PUT BY MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND SAID EUGENE WHO WAS LYING ON HIS BACK WITH HIS HAT ON HIS FACE
483-125126-0074 I CAN HAVE NO HESITATION IN REPLYING IT NOT BEING INCONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT THOSE ACCENTS WERE THE ACCENTS OF THE T'OTHER GOVERNOR YOU'VE TOLERABLE GOOD EYES AIN'T YOU GOVERNOR YOU'VE ALL TOLERABLE GOOD EYES AIN'T YOU
483-125126-0075 DEMANDED THE INFORMER ALL

483-125126-0077 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS CLEAR AND CREEPING UP THE RIVER UNDER THEIR OWN SHORE EUGENE HAD RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW TO LOOK INTO THE DARKNESS AFTER HIM I WISH THE BOAT OF MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND HE MURMURED LYING DOWN AGAIN AND SPEAKING INTO HIS HAT
483-125126-0078 MAY BE ENDOWED WITH PHILANTHROPY ENOUGH TO TURN BOTTOM UPWARD AND EXTINGUISH HIM MORTIMER MY HONOURABLE FRIEND THREE BURGLARIES TWO FORGERIES AND A MIDNIGHT ASSASSINATION
483-125126-0079 YET IN SPITE OF HAVING THOSE WEIGHTS ON HIS CONSCIENCE EUGENE WAS SOMEWHAT ENLIVENED BY THE LATE SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF AFFAIRS SO WERE HIS TWO COMPANIONS ITS BEING A CHANGE WAS EVERYTHING THE SUSPENSE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN A NEW LEASE AND TO HAVE BEGUN AFRESH FROM A RECENT DATE
483-125126-0080 THERE WAS SOMETHING ADDITIONAL TO LOOK FOR THEY WERE ALL THREE MORE SHARPLY ON THE ALERT AND LESS DEADENED BY THE MISERABLE INFLUENCES OF THE PLACE AND TIME MORE THAN AN HOUR HAD PASSED AND THEY WERE EVEN DOZING WHEN ONE OF THE THREE EACH SAID IT WAS HE AND HE HAD NOT DOZED
483-125126-0081 MADE OUT RIDERHOOD IN HIS BOAT AT THE SPOT AGREED ON THEY SPRANG UP CAME OUT FROM THEIR SHELTER AND WENT DOWN TO HIM WHEN HE SAW THEM COMING HE DROPPED ALONGSIDE THE CAUSEWAY SO THAT THEY STANDING ON THE CAUSEWAY COULD SPEAK WITH HIM IN WHISPERS UNDER THE SHADOWY MASS OF THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS FAST ASLEEP
483-125126-0082 BLEST IF I CAN MAKE IT OUT SAID HE STARING AT THEM MAKE WHAT OUT HAVE YOU SEEN HIM NO WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN ASKED LIGHTWOOD
