4511-76322-0000 YES THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AND THERE WAS NO VESTIGE OF A KEY JOYCE WAS SUDDENLY INSPIRED WITH AN IDEA LET'S TRY THE KEYS OF THE OTHER DOORS I NOTICED THAT THEY MOST ALL HAD KEYS IN THE LOCKS PERHAPS ONE WILL FIT THIS
4511-76322-0001 NOW ISN'T THIS PROVOKING EXCLAIMED JOYCE THE ONLY ROOM IN THE HOUSE THAT WE CAN'T GET IN AND THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL I'M CERTAIN WHAT SHALL WE DO CYNTHIA MADE NO REPLY BUT LOOKED AT HER LITTLE SILVER WATCH
4511-76322-0002 DO YOU KNOW THAT IT'S QUARTER PAST SIX SHE ASKED QUIETLY MERCY NO WE'VE GOT TO GO AT ONCE THEN HOW THE TIME HAS GONE RELUCTANTLY ENOUGH THEY HUNTED UP GOLIATH WHO IN THOROUGH BOREDOM
4511-76322-0003 HAD RETURNED TO HIS PLACE ON THE HEARTH RUG IN THE BIG BEDROOM GATHERED TOGETHER THEIR CANDLES AND FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE CELLAR
4511-76322-0004 CYNTHIA HAD THOUGHTFULLY REQUESTED A TIN BISCUIT BOX FROM THE GROCER AND IN THIS THEY PACKED THEIR CANDLES THUS PROTECTING THEM AGAINST THE RAVAGES OF MICE AND LEFT THEM IN THE CELLAR NEAR THE WINDOW THEN THEY CLAMBERED OUT
4511-76322-0005 TO MORROW'S SATURDAY SAID JOYCE IN THE MORNING WE'LL GO TO THE LIBRARY AND LOOK UP THAT BOOK OF COSTUMES AFTER LUNCH WE'LL GO BACK TO THE B U H AND FINISH EXPLORING THERE'S THE ATTIC YET AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND THAT KEY TOO
4511-76322-0006 WITH A GAY GOOD BY THEY SEPARATED EACH TO HER HOME ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE BOARDED UP HOUSE THE RESULT OF THEIR RESEARCHES IN THE LIBRARY NEXT MORNING WAS NOT WHOLLY SATISFACTORY THEY FOUND THAT THE MOST RECENT FASHION OF HOOP SKIRTS OR CRINOLINES HAD PREVAILED ALL THE WAY FROM EIGHTEEN FORTY TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY OR THEREABOUTS
4511-76322-0007 AND WHILE THESE DATES LIMITED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE TIME OF THE MYSTERIOUS HAPPENING IT DID NOT HELP THEM VERY MUCH THEY FELT THAT THEY MUST LOOK FOR SOME MORE DEFINITE CLUE THAT AFTERNOON THEY ENTERED THE BOARDED UP HOUSE FOR THE THIRD TIME
4511-76322-0008 THEY FOUND GOLIATH ALREADY IN THE CELLAR OWING NO DOUBT TO THE FACT THAT BATES'S PUP WAS PATROLLING THE FRONT YARD SO THEY INVITED HIM TO ACCOMPANY THEM AN INVITATION WHICH HE ACCEPTED WITH ARCHED BACK AND RESOUNDING PURR
4511-76322-0009 DECIDING TO EXPLORE THE ATTIC FIRST
4511-76322-0010 AT ANY OTHER TIME OR IN ANY OTHER HOUSE THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND THIS ATTIC OF ABSORBING INTEREST IN ITS DUSKY CORNERS STOOD SPINNING WHEELS AND WINDING REELS DECREPIT FURNITURE OF AN ANCIENT DATE HAD FOUND A REFUGE THERE
4511-76322-0011 ANTIQUE HAIR TRUNKS LINED THE SIDES UNDER THE EAVES AND QUAINT GARMENTS HUNG ABOUT ON PEGS THE ATTIC WAS THE ONLY APARTMENT IN THIS STRANGE HOUSE THAT RECEIVED THE LIGHT OF DAY FOR THE TWO LITTLE WINDOWS LIKE STARING EYES WERE NOT BOARDED UP
4511-76322-0012 BUT THE ATTIC HAD NO GREAT HOLDING INTEREST AT PRESENT SINCE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IT CONTAINED NO CLUE TO HELP THEM IN THE SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERY AND THEY SOON LEFT IT TO SEARCH ANEW EVERY ROOM BELOW
4511-76322-0013 IN THE HOPE OF COMING UPON THE MISSING KEY THESE OLD FASHIONED KEYS ARE SO IMMENSE THAT IT HARDLY SEEMS POSSIBLE THAT ANY ONE WOULD CARRY ONE OFF FAR CONJECTURED JOYCE BUT WHY IN THE WORLD
4511-76322-0014 SHOULD JUST THAT ROOM BE LOCKED ANYWAY WHAT CAN BE HIDDEN THERE I'M WILD SIMPLY WILD WITH IMPATIENCE TO SEE IT ALL THE SEARCH FOR THE KEY WAS NOT EXACTLY SYSTEMATIC
4511-76322-0015 NEITHER OF THE GIRLS FELT AT LIBERTY TO OPEN BUREAU DRAWERS OR PRY INTO CLOSETS AND TRUNKS BESIDES AS CYNTHIA WISELY SUGGESTED IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT ANY ONE WOULD LOCK A DOOR SO CAREFULLY
4511-76322-0016 AND THEN PUT THE KEY IN A DRAWER OR TRUNK OR ON A SHELF THEY WOULD EITHER CARRY IT AWAY WITH THEM OR LAY IT DOWN FORGOTTEN OR HIDE IT IN SOME UNUSUAL PLACE
4511-76322-0017 IF IT HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY OF COURSE THEIR SEARCH WAS USELESS BUT IF IT HAD BEEN THOUGHTLESSLY LAID ASIDE SOMEWHERE OR EVEN HIDDEN AWAY IN SOME OBSCURE CORNER THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MIGHT COME UPON IT
4511-76322-0018 WITH THIS HOPE IN MIND THEY WENT FROM ROOM TO ROOM SEARCHING ON DESKS CHAIRS AND TABLES POKING INTO DARK CORNERS PEEPING INTO VASES AND OTHER SUCH RECEPTACLES AND FEELING ABOUT UNDER THE FURNITURE BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE
4511-76322-0019 THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE GREAT BEDROOM WHERE WERE SO MANY SIGNS OF AGITATION AND HURRIED DEPARTURE DECIDING THAT HERE WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY FIELD FOR DISCOVERY GOLIATH HAD EVIDENTLY PRECEDED THEM
4511-76322-0020 FOR THEY FOUND HIM ONCE MORE CURLED UP ON THE SOFT RUG BEFORE THE FIREPLACE HE SEEMED TO PREFER THIS COMFORTABLE SPOT TO ALL OTHERS BUT HE ROSE AND STRETCHED WHEN THE GIRLS CAME IN
4511-76322-0021 JOYCE WENT STRAIGHT FOR THE CHIMNEY PLACE I'M GOING TO POKE AMONG THESE ASHES SHE ANNOUNCED A LOT OF THINGS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BURNED HERE MOSTLY OLD LETTERS WHO KNOWS BUT WHAT THE KEY MAY HAVE BEEN THROWN IN TOO
4511-76322-0022 SHE BEGAN TO RAKE THE DEAD ASHES AND SUDDENLY A HALF BURNED LOG FELL APART
4511-76322-0023 DID YOU HEAR THAT SHE WHISPERED SOMETHING CLINKED ASHES OR WOOD WON'T MAKE THAT SOUND OH SUPPOSE IT IS THE KEY SHE RAKED AWAY AGAIN FRANTICALLY AND HAULED OUT A QUANTITY OF CHARRED DEBRIS
4511-76322-0024 BUT NOTHING EVEN FAINTLY RESEMBLING A KEY WHEN NOTHING MORE REMAINED SHE POKED THE FRAGMENTS DISGUSTEDLY WHILE CYNTHIA LOOKED ON SEE THERE CYNTHIA SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED
4511-76322-0025 WHATEVER IT WAS THE FIRE HAS PRETTY WELL FINISHED IT YOU CAN SEE THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER VALUABLE ONCE THERE'S GOLD ON IT HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION TO ADD TO OUR CATECHISM WHAT IS IT AND WHY WAS IT THROWN IN THE FIRE
4511-76322-0026 WHATEVER IT WAS IT DOESN'T HELP MUCH NOW IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN THE KEY GOOD GRACIOUS IS THAT A RAT BOTH GIRLS JUMPED TO THEIR FEET
4511-76322-0027 AND STOOD LISTENING TO THE STRANGE SOUNDS THAT CAME FROM UNDER THE VALANCE HANGING ABOUT THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT FOUR POSTER BED IT WAS A CURIOUS INTERMITTENT IRREGULAR SOUND AS OF SOMETHING BEING PUSHED ABOUT THE FLOOR
4511-76322-0028 AFTER THEY HAD LISTENED A MOMENT IT SUDDENLY STRUCK THEM BOTH THAT THE NOISE WAS SOMEHOW VERY FAMILIAR WHY IT'S GOLIATH OF COURSE LAUGHED CYNTHIA
4511-76322-0029 KNOCKING IT ABOUT YOU KNOW LET'S SEE WHAT IT IS THEY TIPTOED OVER AND RAISED THE VALANCE CYNTHIA WAS RIGHT
4511-76322-0030 DESPITE THE ROLLS OF DUST THAT LAY ABOUT JOYCE CRAWLED UNDER AND RESCUED IT SHE EMERGED WITH A FLUSHED FACE AND A TRIUMPHANT CHUCKLE GOLIATH BEATS US ALL HE'S MADE THE BEST FIND YET IS IT THE KEY CRIED CYNTHIA
4511-76322-0031 JOYCE DANGLED A LARGE GOLD LOCKET SUSPENDED ON A NARROW BLACK VELVET RIBBON IN THE CANDLE LIGHT THE LOCKET GLISTENED WITH TINY JEWELS DO YOU RECOGNIZE IT DEMANDED JOYCE RECOGNIZE IT HOW SHOULD I WHY CYNTHIA
4511-76322-0032 IT'S THE VERY ONE THAT HANGS ABOUT THE NECK OF OUR LOVELY LADY IN THE PICTURE DOWN STAIRS IT WAS INDEED NO OTHER EVEN THE NARROW BLACK VELVET RIBBON WAS IDENTICAL
4511-76322-0033 SHE MUST HAVE DROPPED IT ACCIDENTALLY PERHAPS WHEN SHE TOOK IT OFF AND IT ROLLED UNDER THE BED IN HER HURRY SHE PROBABLY FORGOT IT SAID JOYCE LAYING IT BESIDE THE CURIOUS DISK THEY HAD RAKED FROM THE FIREPLACE ISN'T IT A BEAUTY
4511-76322-0034 IT MUST BE VERY VALUABLE CYNTHIA BENT DOWN AND EXAMINED BOTH ARTICLES CLOSELY
4511-76322-0035 WHY SO THEY ARE EXCLAIMED JOYCE OH I HAVE AN IDEA CYNTHIA CAN WE OPEN THE LOCKET LET'S TRY
4511-76322-0036 THE LOCKET FELL OPEN AND REVEALED ITSELF EMPTY JOYCE TOOK UP THE DISK AND FITTED IT INTO ONE SIDE WITH THE GOLD BACK PRESSED INWARD
4511-76322-0037 IT SLID INTO PLACE LEAVING NO SHADOW OF DOUBT THAT IT HAD ORIGINALLY FORMED PART OF THIS TRINKET NOW
4511-76322-0038 HOW CAME IT IN THE FIRE THE TWO GIRLS STOOD LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND AT THE LOCKET MORE BEWILDERED THAN EVER BY THIS CURIOUS DISCOVERY GOLIATH CHEATED OF HIS PLAYTHING
4511-76322-0039 WAS MAKING FUTILE DABS AT THE DANGLING VELVET RIBBON SUDDENLY
