4090-183978-0005 IF SHE HAD GONE ON DOUBTING HIM HE COULD PROBABLY HAVE GONE ON DECEIVING HER
4090-183978-0006 AT THE SAME MOMENT A DOUBT SHOT UP ITS SERPENT HEAD IN HIS OWN BOSOM
4090-183978-0007 SUCH TRUSTFULNESS SEEMED OPEN TO SUSPICION BUT THE MOMENT HIS EYES FELL ON HER HE WAS ASHAMED OF THE THOUGHT AND KNEW IT FOR WHAT IT REALLY WAS ANOTHER PRETEXT TO LESSEN HIS OWN DELINQUENCY WHY SHOULD OUR GOOD TIME BE OVER HE ASKED
4090-183978-0008 SHE LOOKED UP HER LIPS PARTED IN SURPRISE BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK HE WENT ON I WANT YOU TO STAY WITH ME
4090-183978-0009 TO HAVE ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT'S NOT ALWAYS MAY AND PARIS WHY NOT MAKE THE MOST OF THEM NOW YOU KNOW ME WE'RE NOT STRANGERS WHY SHOULDN'T YOU TREAT ME LIKE A FRIEND WHILE HE SPOKE SHE HAD DRAWN AWAY A LITTLE BUT HER HAND STILL LAY IN HIS

4090-183978-0011 AND BECAUSE I COULDN'T BEAR TO HAVE YOU GO HE HAD THE FEELING THAT THE WORDS WERE BEING UTTERED IN SPITE OF HIM BY SOME MALICIOUS WITNESS OF THE SCENE AND YET THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE THEM SPOKEN THE GIRL HAD LISTENED TO HIM IN SILENCE
4090-183978-0012 THEN SHE SNATCHED AWAY HER HAND YOU DIDN'T POST MY LETTER YOU KEPT IT BACK ON PURPOSE AND YOU TELL ME SO NOW TO PROVE TO ME THAT I'D BETTER PUT MYSELF UNDER YOUR PROTECTION

4090-183978-0015 HER OUTBURST DID NOT OFFEND THE YOUNG MAN
4090-183978-0016 HE DREW UP A CHAIR AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AFTER ALL HE SAID IN A TONE OF GOOD HUMOURED PROTEST
4090-183978-0017 AND MY TELLING YOU SEEMS RATHER STRONG PROOF THAT I HADN'T ANY VERY NEFARIOUS DESIGNS ON YOU SHE MET THIS WITH A SHRUG BUT HE DID NOT GIVE HER TIME TO ANSWER MY DESIGNS
4090-183978-0018 HE PAUSED AGAIN AND THEN WENT ON IN THE SAME TONE OF FRIENDLY REASONABLENESS
4090-183978-0019 INTENTIONS HE STOOD UP WALKED THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM AND TURNED BACK TO WHERE SHE STILL SAT MOTIONLESS
4090-183978-0020 HER CHIN ON HER HANDS WHAT RUBBISH WE TALK ABOUT INTENTIONS THE TRUTH IS I HADN'T ANY I JUST LIKED BEING WITH YOU PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW EXTRAORDINARILY ONE CAN LIKE BEING WITH YOU I WAS DEPRESSED AND ADRIFT MYSELF AND YOU MADE ME FORGET MY BOTHERS
4090-183978-0021 I DIDN'T SEE WHY WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A FEW HOURS TOGETHER FIRST SO I LEFT YOUR LETTER IN MY POCKET HE SAW HER FACE MELT AS SHE LISTENED AND SUDDENLY SHE UNCLASPED HER HANDS AND LEANED TO HIM BUT ARE YOU UNHAPPY TOO
4090-183978-0022 BUT HER LOOK OF SYMPATHY HAD DISARMED HIM HIS HEART WAS BITTER AND DISTRACTED SHE WAS NEAR HIM HER EYES WERE SHINING WITH COMPASSION HE BENT OVER HER AND KISSED HER HAND FORGIVE ME DO FORGIVE ME HE SAID
4090-183978-0023 SHE STOOD UP WITH A SMILING HEAD SHAKE
4090-183978-0024 MUCH LESS TWO WHOLE DAYS OF IT I SHA'N'T FORGET HOW KIND YOU'VE BEEN
4090-183978-0025 BUT THIS IS GOOD BYE YOU KNOW I MUST TELEGRAPH AT ONCE TO SAY I'M COMING TO SAY YOU'RE COMING THEN I'M NOT FORGIVEN OH YOU'RE FORGIVEN IF THAT'S ANY COMFORT
4090-183978-0026 SHE HUNG HER HEAD IN MEDITATION BUT I CAN'T STAY HOW CAN I STAY SHE BROKE OUT AS IF ARGUING WITH SOME UNSEEN MONITOR WHY CAN'T YOU
4090-183978-0027 SHE LOOKED UP AND THEIR EYES EXCHANGED MEANINGS FOR A RAPID MINUTE
4090-183978-0028 OH IT'S NOT THAT SHE EXCLAIMED ALMOST IMPATIENTLY IT'S NOT PEOPLE I'M AFRAID OF THEY'VE NEVER PUT THEMSELVES OUT FOR ME WHY ON EARTH SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THEM HE LIKED HER DIRECTNESS AS HE HAD NEVER LIKED IT BEFORE WELL THEN WHAT IS IT
4090-183978-0029 NOT ME I HOPE NO NOT YOU I LIKE YOU IT'S THE MONEY WITH ME THAT'S ALWAYS THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
4090-183978-0030 IS THAT ALL HE LAUGHED RELIEVED BY HER NATURALNESS LOOK HERE
4090-183978-0031 CAN'T YOU TRUST ME ABOUT THAT TOO TRUST YOU HOW DO YOU MEAN
4090-183978-0032 HIS GESTURE BRUSHED ASIDE THE ALLUSION MONEY MAY BE THE ROOT OF THE MATTER IT CAN'T BE THE WHOLE OF IT BETWEEN FRIENDS DON'T YOU THINK ONE FRIEND MAY ACCEPT A SMALL SERVICE FROM ANOTHER WITHOUT LOOKING TOO FAR AHEAD OR WEIGHING TOO MANY CHANCES
4090-183978-0033 AND THE PLEASURE YOU'LL BE GIVING ME LET'S SHAKE HANDS ON IT
4090-183978-0034 ONLY I SHALL BE SORRY HE ENDED OH BUT I SHALL BE SORRY TOO
4090-183978-0035 INSTANTLY EFFACED BY THE EXCITEMENT OF PURSUIT WELL THEN HE STOOD LOOKING DOWN ON HER HIS EYES PERSUADING HER HE WAS NOW INTENSELY AWARE THAT HIS NEARNESS WAS HAVING AN EFFECT WHICH MADE IT LESS AND LESS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO CHOOSE HIS WORDS AND HE WENT ON
4090-183978-0036 MORE MINDFUL OF THE INFLECTIONS OF HIS VOICE THAN OF WHAT HE WAS ACTUALLY SAYING WHY ON EARTH SHOULD WE SAY GOOD BYE IF WE'RE BOTH SORRY TO
4090-183978-0037 IT'S NOT A BIT LIKE YOU TO LET ANYTHING STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR SAYING JUST WHAT YOU FEEL
4090-183978-0038 SHE HUNG BEFORE HIM LIKE A LEAF ON THE MEETING OF CROSS CURRENTS THAT THE NEXT RIPPLE MAY SWEEP FORWARD OR WHIRL BACK
4090-183978-0039 SHE TURNED ABOUT ON HER HEEL AND DROPPING INTO THE NEAREST CHAIR SANK FORWARD HER FACE HIDDEN AGAINST THE DRESSING TABLE
4090-183978-0040 RECALLED THE FAINT CURVES OF A TERRA COTTA STATUETTE SOME YOUNG IMAGE OF GRACE HARDLY MORE THAN SKETCHED IN THE CLAY DARROW AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT HER REFLECTED THAT HER CHARACTER FOR ALL ITS SEEMING FIRMNESS ITS FLASHING EDGES OF OPINION WAS PROBABLY NO LESS IMMATURE
4090-183978-0041 OR TO CONFESS HER YIELDING IN THAT WAY AT FIRST HE WAS SLIGHTLY DISCONCERTED THEN HE SAW HOW HER ATTITUDE SIMPLIFIED HIS OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAD ALL THE INDECISION AND AWKWARDNESS OF INEXPERIENCE IT SHOWED THAT SHE WAS A CHILD AFTER ALL AND ALL HE COULD DO
4090-183978-0042 ALL HE HAD EVER MEANT TO DO WAS TO GIVE HER A CHILD'S HOLIDAY TO LOOK BACK TO FOR A MOMENT HE FANCIED SHE WAS CRYING
4090-183978-0043 IS IT TRUE IS IT REALLY TRUE
4090-183978-0044 HE FELT LIKE ANSWERING
