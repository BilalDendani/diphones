4492-8907-0000 THE DOCTOR'S PROFESSIONAL VISIT TO HINTOCK HOUSE WAS PROMPTLY REPEATED THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT
4492-8907-0001 AND BEHAVING GENERALLY AS BECAME A PATIENT WHO WAS IN NO GREAT HURRY TO LOSE THAT TITLE ON EACH OCCASION HE LOOKED GRAVELY AT THE LITTLE SCRATCH ON HER ARM AS IF IT HAD BEEN A SERIOUS WOUND
4492-8907-0002 HE HAD ALSO TO HIS FURTHER SATISFACTION FOUND A SLIGHT SCAR ON HER TEMPLE AND IT WAS VERY CONVENIENT TO PUT A PIECE OF BLACK PLASTER ON THIS CONSPICUOUS PART OF HER PERSON IN PREFERENCE TO GOLD BEATER'S SKIN
4492-8907-0003 SO THAT IT MIGHT CATCH THE EYES OF THE SERVANTS AND MAKE HIS PRESENCE APPEAR DECIDEDLY NECESSARY IN CASE THERE SHOULD BE ANY DOUBT OF THE FACT OH YOU HURT ME SHE EXCLAIMED ONE DAY HE WAS PEELING OFF THE BIT OF PLASTER ON HER ARM
4492-8907-0004 UNDER WHICH THE SCRAPE HAD TURNED THE COLOR OF AN UNRIPE BLACKBERRY PREVIOUS TO VANISHING ALTOGETHER WAIT A MOMENT THEN I'LL DAMP IT SAID FITZPIERS HE PUT HIS LIPS TO THE PLACE AND KEPT THEM THERE TILL THE PLASTER CAME OFF EASILY
4492-8907-0005 IT WAS AT YOUR REQUEST I PUT IT ON SAID HE I KNOW IT SHE REPLIED IS THAT BLUE VEIN STILL IN MY TEMPLE THAT USED TO SHOW THERE THE SCAR MUST BE JUST UPON IT IF THE CUT HAD BEEN A LITTLE DEEPER IT WOULD HAVE SPILT
4492-8907-0006 MY HOT BLOOD INDEED FITZPIERS EXAMINED SO CLOSELY THAT HIS BREATH TOUCHED HER TENDERLY AT WHICH THEIR EYES ROSE TO AN ENCOUNTER HERS SHOWING THEMSELVES AS DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS AS INTERSTELLAR SPACE
4492-8907-0007 SHE TURNED HER FACE AWAY SUDDENLY AH NONE OF THAT NONE OF THAT I CANNOT COQUET WITH YOU SHE CRIED DON'T SUPPOSE I CONSENT TO FOR ONE MOMENT OUR POOR BRIEF YOUTHFUL HOUR OF LOVE MAKING WAS TOO LONG AGO TO BEAR CONTINUING NOW
4492-8907-0008 COQUET NOR I WITH YOU AS IT WAS WHEN I FOUND THE HISTORIC GLOVES SO IT IS NOW I MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE FOOLISH BUT I AM NO TRIFLER
4492-8907-0009 I NATURALLY CANNOT FORGET THAT LITTLE SPACE IN WHICH I FLITTED ACROSS THE FIELD OF YOUR VISION IN THOSE DAYS OF THE PAST AND THE RECOLLECTION OPENS UP ALL SORTS OF IMAGININGS SUPPOSE MY MOTHER HAD NOT TAKEN ME AWAY SHE MURMURED
4492-8907-0010 HER DREAMY EYES RESTING ON THE SWAYING TIP OF A DISTANT TREE
4492-8907-0011 AND THEN THEN THE FIRE WOULD HAVE BURNED HIGHER AND HIGHER WHAT WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED I KNOW NOT BUT SORROW AND SICKNESS OF HEART AT LAST
4492-8907-0012 WELL THAT'S THE END OF ALL LOVE ACCORDING TO NATURE'S LAW I CAN GIVE NO OTHER REASON OH DON'T SPEAK LIKE THAT SHE EXCLAIMED SINCE WE ARE ONLY PICTURING THE POSSIBILITIES OF THAT TIME DON'T FOR PITY'S SAKE SPOIL THE PICTURE
4492-8907-0013 HER VOICE SANK ALMOST TO A WHISPER AS SHE ADDED WITH AN INCIPIENT POUT UPON HER FULL LIPS LET ME THINK AT LEAST THAT IF YOU HAD REALLY LOVED ME AT ALL SERIOUSLY YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED ME FOR EVER AND EVER YOU ARE RIGHT
4492-8907-0014 THINK IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART SAID HE IT IS A PLEASANT THOUGHT AND COSTS NOTHING SHE WEIGHED THAT REMARK IN SILENCE A WHILE DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING OF ME FROM THEN TILL NOW SHE INQUIRED NOT A WORD
4492-8907-0015 SO MUCH THE BETTER I HAD TO FIGHT THE BATTLE OF LIFE AS WELL AS YOU I MAY TELL YOU ABOUT IT SOME DAY BUT DON'T EVER ASK ME TO DO IT AND PARTICULARLY DO NOT PRESS ME TO TELL YOU NOW
4492-8907-0016 THUS THE TWO OR THREE DAYS THAT THEY HAD SPENT IN TENDER ACQUAINTANCE ON THE ROMANTIC SLOPES ABOVE THE NECKAR WERE STRETCHED OUT IN RETROSPECT TO THE LENGTH AND IMPORTANCE OF YEARS MADE TO FORM A CANVAS FOR INFINITE FANCIES
4492-8907-0017 IDLE DREAMS LUXURIOUS MELANCHOLIES AND SWEET ALLURING ASSERTIONS WHICH COULD NEITHER BE PROVED NOR DISPROVED GRACE WAS NEVER MENTIONED BETWEEN THEM BUT A RUMOR OF HIS PROPOSED DOMESTIC CHANGES SOMEHOW REACHED HER EARS
4492-8907-0018 DOCTOR YOU ARE GOING AWAY SHE EXCLAIMED CONFRONTING HIM WITH ACCUSATORY REPROACH IN HER LARGE DARK EYES NO LESS THAN IN HER RICH COOING VOICE OH YES YOU ARE SHE WENT ON SPRINGING TO HER FEET
4492-8907-0019 WITH AN AIR WHICH MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN CALLED PASSIONATE IT IS NO USE DENYING IT YOU HAVE BOUGHT A PRACTICE AT BUDMOUTH
4492-8907-0020 NOBODY CAN LIVE AT HINTOCK LEAST OF ALL A PROFESSIONAL MAN WHO WANTS TO KEEP ABREAST OF RECENT DISCOVERY AND THERE IS NOBODY HERE TO INDUCE SUCH A ONE TO STAY FOR OTHER REASONS THAT'S RIGHT
4492-8907-0021 AND MY DEAR FRIEND IF I CONTINUE TO FEEL ABOUT THE BUSINESS AS I FEEL AT THIS MOMENT PERHAPS I MAY CONCLUDE NEVER TO GO AT ALL BUT YOU HATE HINTOCK AND EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN IT THAT YOU DON'T MEAN TO TAKE AWAY WITH YOU
4492-8907-0022 FITZPIERS CONTRADICTED THIS IDEA IN HIS MOST VIBRATORY TONES AND SHE LAPSED INTO THE FRIVOLOUS ARCHNESS UNDER WHICH SHE HID PASSIONS OF NO MEAN STRENGTH STRANGE SMOULDERING ERRATIC PASSIONS KEPT DOWN LIKE A STIFLED
4492-8907-0023 CONFLAGRATION BUT BURSTING OUT NOW HERE NOW THERE THE ONLY CERTAIN ELEMENT IN THEIR DIRECTION BEING ITS UNEXPECTEDNESS
4492-8907-0024 SHE LIKED MYSTERY IN HER LIFE IN HER LOVE IN HER HISTORY
4492-8907-0025 AND MANY THINGS OF WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROUD BUT IT HAD NEVER BEEN FATHOMED BY THE HONEST MINDS OF HINTOCK AND SHE RARELY VOLUNTEERED HER EXPERIENCES AS FOR HER CAPRICIOUS NATURE THE PEOPLE ON HER ESTATES GREW ACCUSTOMED TO IT
4492-8907-0026 AND WITH THAT MARVELLOUS SUBTLETY OF CONTRIVANCE IN STEERING ROUND ODD TEMPERS THAT IS FOUND IN SONS OF THE SOIL AND DEPENDANTS GENERALLY THEY MANAGED TO GET ALONG UNDER HER GOVERNMENT RATHER BETTER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE DONE BENEATH A MORE EQUABLE RULE
4492-8907-0027 NOW WITH REGARD TO THE DOCTOR'S NOTION OF LEAVING HINTOCK HE HAD ADVANCED FURTHER TOWARDS COMPLETING THE PURCHASE OF THE BUDMOUTH SURGEON'S GOOD WILL THAN HE HAD ADMITTED TO MISSUS CHARMOND THE WHOLE MATTER HUNG UPON WHAT HE MIGHT DO
4492-8907-0028 IN THE ENSUING TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE EVENING AFTER LEAVING HER HE WENT OUT INTO THE LANE AND WALKED AND PONDERED BETWEEN THE HIGH HEDGES NOW GREENISH WHITE WITH WILD CLEMATIS HERE CALLED OLD MAN'S BEARD FROM ITS ASPECT LATER IN THE YEAR
4492-8907-0029 AFTER WHICH HIS DEPARTURE FROM HINTOCK WOULD BE IRREVOCABLE BUT COULD HE GO AWAY REMEMBERING WHAT HAD JUST PASSED THE TREES THE HILLS THE LEAVES THE GRASS
4492-8907-0030 EACH HAD BEEN ENDOWED AND QUICKENED WITH A SUBTLE CHARM SINCE HE HAD DISCOVERED THE PERSON AND HISTORY AND ABOVE ALL MOOD OF THEIR OWNER THERE WAS EVERY TEMPORAL REASON FOR LEAVING IT
4492-8907-0031 HIS WIFE HERSELF SAW THE AWKWARDNESS OF THEIR POSITION HERE AND CHEERFULLY WELCOMED THE PURPOSED CHANGE TOWARDS WHICH EVERY STEP HAD BEEN TAKEN BUT THE LAST BUT COULD HE FIND IT IN HIS HEART AS HE FOUND IT CLEARLY ENOUGH IN HIS CONSCIENCE TO GO AWAY
4492-8907-0032 HE DREW A TROUBLED BREATH AND WENT IN DOORS HERE HE RAPIDLY PENNED A LETTER
4492-8907-0033 AND SO GOT THE LETTER OFF THE MAN RETURNED MET FITZPIERS IN THE LANE AND TOLD HIM THE THING WAS DONE FITZPIERS WENT BACK TO HIS HOUSE MUSING
4492-8907-0034 WHY HAD HE CARRIED OUT THIS IMPULSE TAKEN SUCH WILD TROUBLE TO EFFECT A PROBABLE INJURY TO HIS OWN AND HIS YOUNG WIFE'S PROSPECTS HIS MOTIVE WAS FANTASTIC GLOWING SHAPELESS AS THE FIERY SCENERY ABOUT THE WESTERN SKY
4492-8907-0035 MISSUS CHARMOND COULD OVERTLY BE NOTHING MORE TO HIM THAN A PATIENT NOW AND TO HIS WIFE AT THE OUTSIDE A PATRON IN THE UNATTACHED BACHELOR DAYS OF HIS FIRST SOJOURNING HERE HOW HIGHLY PROPER AN EMOTIONAL REASON FOR LINGERING ON WOULD HAVE APPEARED
4492-8907-0036 TO TROUBLESOME DUBIOUSNESS MATRIMONIAL AMBITION IS SUCH AN HONORABLE THING MY FATHER HAS TOLD ME THAT YOU HAVE SENT OFF ONE OF THE MEN WITH A LATE LETTER TO BUDMOUTH CRIED GRACE COMING OUT VIVACIOUSLY TO MEET HIM UNDER THE DECLINING LIGHT OF THE SKY
4492-8907-0037 WHEREIN HUNG SOLITARY THE FOLDING STAR I SAID AT ONCE THAT YOU HAD FINALLY AGREED TO PAY THE PREMIUM THEY ASK AND THAT THE TEDIOUS QUESTION HAD BEEN SETTLED WHEN DO WE GO EDGAR I HAVE ALTERED MY MIND SAID HE
4492-8907-0038 THEY WANT TOO MUCH SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY IS TOO LARGE A SUM AND IN SHORT I HAVE DECLINED TO GO FURTHER WE MUST WAIT FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY I FEAR I AM NOT A GOOD BUSINESS MAN
4492-8907-0039 HE SPOKE THE LAST WORDS WITH A MOMENTARY FALTERING AT THE GREAT FOOLISHNESS OF HIS ACT FOR AS HE LOOKED IN HER FAIR AND HONORABLE FACE HIS HEART REPROACHED HIM FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE HER MANNER THAT EVENING SHOWED HER DISAPPOINTMENT
4492-8907-0040 PERSONALLY SHE LIKED THE HOME OF HER CHILDHOOD MUCH AND SHE WAS NOT AMBITIOUS BUT HER HUSBAND HAD SEEMED SO DISSATISFIED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES HEREABOUT SINCE THEIR MARRIAGE THAT SHE HAD SINCERELY HOPED TO GO FOR HIS SAKE
4492-8907-0041 IT WAS TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE HE VISITED MISSUS CHARMOND AGAIN THE MORNING HAD BEEN WINDY AND LITTLE SHOWERS HAD SOWED THEMSELVES LIKE GRAIN AGAINST THE WALLS AND WINDOW PANES OF THE HINTOCK COTTAGES
4492-8907-0042 RAN DOWN THE BARK OF THE OAKS AND ELMS THE RIND BELOW BEING COATED WITH A LICHENOUS WASH AS GREEN AS EMERALD THEY WERE STOUT TRUNKED TREES THAT NEVER ROCKED THEIR STEMS IN THE FIERCEST GALE
4492-8907-0043 RESPONDING TO IT ENTIRELY BY CROOKING THEIR LIMBS WRINKLED LIKE AN OLD CRONE'S FACE AND ANTLERED WITH DEAD BRANCHES THAT ROSE ABOVE THE FOLIAGE OF THEIR SUMMITS
4492-8907-0044 AND FITZPIERS WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE WINDOW CURTAINS WERE CLOSED AND A RED SHADED LAMP AND CANDLES BURNING
4492-8907-0045 THOUGH IT WAS NOT COLD WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN HE ASKED SHE SAT IN AN EASY CHAIR HER FACE BEING TURNED AWAY OH SHE MURMURED IT IS BECAUSE THE WORLD IS SO DREARY OUTSIDE
4492-8907-0046 SORROW AND BITTERNESS IN THE SKY AND FLOODS OF AGONIZED TEARS BEATING AGAINST THE PANES I LAY AWAKE LAST NIGHT AND I COULD HEAR THE SCRAPE OF SNAILS CREEPING UP THE WINDOW GLASS IT WAS SO SAD
4492-8907-0047 MY EYES WERE SO HEAVY THIS MORNING THAT I COULD HAVE WEPT MY LIFE AWAY I CANNOT BEAR YOU TO SEE MY FACE I KEEP IT AWAY FROM YOU PURPOSELY
4492-8907-0048 WHY SHOULD DEATH ONLY LEND WHAT LIFE IS COMPELLED TO BORROW REST ANSWER THAT DOCTOR FITZPIERS YOU MUST EAT OF A SECOND TREE OF KNOWLEDGE BEFORE YOU CAN DO IT FELICE CHARMOND THEN WHEN MY EMOTIONS HAVE EXHAUSTED THEMSELVES
4492-8907-0049 I BECOME FULL OF FEARS TILL I THINK I SHALL DIE FOR VERY FEAR THE TERRIBLE INSISTENCIES OF SOCIETY HOW SEVERE THEY ARE AND COLD AND INEXORABLE GHASTLY TOWARDS THOSE WHO ARE MADE OF WAX AND NOT OF STONE OH I AM AFRAID OF THEM
4492-8907-0050 CORRECTIVES AND REGULATIONS FRAMED THAT SOCIETY MAY TEND TO PERFECTION
4492-8907-0051 FITZPIERS HAD SEATED HIMSELF NEAR HER WHAT SETS YOU IN THIS MOURNFUL MOOD HE ASKED GENTLY IN REALITY HE KNEW THAT IT WAS THE RESULT OF A LOSS OF TONE FROM STAYING IN DOORS SO MUCH BUT HE DID NOT SAY SO
4492-8907-0052 MY REFLECTIONS DOCTOR YOU MUST NOT COME HERE ANY MORE THEY BEGIN TO THINK IT A FARCE ALREADY I SAY YOU MUST COME NO MORE
