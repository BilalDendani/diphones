3618-175930-0000 CHAPTER FIVE HOW TO READ A CLASSIC LET US BEGIN EXPERIMENTAL READING WITH CHARLES LAMB I CHOOSE LAMB FOR VARIOUS REASONS HE IS A GREAT WRITER
3618-175930-0001 WIDE IN HIS APPEAL OF A HIGHLY SYMPATHETIC TEMPERAMENT AND HIS FINEST ACHIEVEMENTS ARE SIMPLE AND VERY SHORT MOREOVER HE MAY USEFULLY LEAD TO OTHER AND MORE COMPLEX MATTERS AS WILL APPEAR LATER
3618-175930-0002 NOW YOUR NATURAL TENDENCY WILL BE TO THINK OF CHARLES LAMB AS A BOOK BECAUSE HE HAS ARRIVED AT THE STAGE OF BEING A CLASSIC CHARLES LAMB WAS A MAN
3618-175930-0003 SHOULD ALWAYS FORM AN IDEA OF THE MAN BEHIND THE BOOK THE BOOK IS NOTHING BUT THE EXPRESSION OF THE MAN THE BOOK IS NOTHING BUT THE MAN TRYING TO TALK TO YOU TRYING TO IMPART TO YOU SOME OF HIS FEELINGS
3618-175930-0004 AN EXPERIENCED STUDENT WILL DIVINE THE MAN FROM THE BOOK WILL UNDERSTAND THE MAN BY THE BOOK AS IS OF COURSE LOGICALLY PROPER BUT THE BEGINNER WILL DO WELL TO AID HIMSELF IN UNDERSTANDING THE BOOK
3618-175930-0005 BY MEANS OF INDEPENDENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE MAN HE WILL THUS AT ONCE RELATE THE BOOK TO SOMETHING HUMAN AND STRENGTHEN IN HIS MIND THE ESSENTIAL NOTION OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LITERATURE AND LIFE
3618-175930-0006 THE EARLIEST LITERATURE WAS DELIVERED ORALLY DIRECT BY THE ARTIST TO THE RECIPIENT IN SOME RESPECTS THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS IDEAL CHANGES IN THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY HAVE RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE
3618-175930-0007 NEVERTHELESS WE CAN STILL BY THE EXERCISE OF THE IMAGINATION HEAR MENTALLY THE ACCENTS OF THE ARTIST SPEAKING TO US WE MUST SO EXERCISE OUR IMAGINATION AS TO FEEL THE MAN BEHIND THE BOOK
3618-175930-0008 SOME BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ABOUT LAMB SHOULD BE ACQUIRED THERE ARE EXCELLENT SHORT BIOGRAPHIES OF HIM BY CANON AINGER IN THE DICTIONARY OF NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY IN CHAMBERS'S ENCYCLOPAEDIA
3618-175930-0009 AND IN CHAMBERS'S CYCLOPAEDIA OF ENGLISH LITERATURE IF YOU HAVE NONE OF THESE BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THE LAST THERE ARE MISTER E V LUCAS'S EXHAUSTIVE LIFE
3618-175930-0010 AND CHEAPER MISTER WALTER JERROLD'S LAMB
3618-175930-0011 HUMAN BEING ARE PRODIGIOUS WHEN YOU HAVE MADE FOR YOURSELF SUCH A PICTURE READ
3618-175930-0012 THE LIGHT OF IT I WILL CHOOSE ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED DREAM CHILDREN A REVERIE AT THIS POINT KINDLY PUT MY BOOK DOWN AND READ DREAM CHILDREN
3618-175930-0013 DO NOT SAY TO YOURSELF THAT YOU WILL READ IT LATER BUT READ IT NOW WHEN YOU HAVE READ IT YOU MAY PROCEED TO MY NEXT PARAGRAPH YOU ARE TO CONSIDER DREAM CHILDREN AS A HUMAN DOCUMENT
3618-175930-0014 LAMB WAS NEARING FIFTY WHEN HE WROTE IT YOU CAN SEE ESPECIALLY FROM THE LAST LINE THAT THE DEATH OF HIS ELDER BROTHER JOHN LAMB WAS FRESH AND HEAVY ON HIS MIND
3618-175930-0015 ANN SIMMONS WHO AFTERWARDS MARRIED A MAN NAMED BARTRUM YOU WILL KNOW THAT ONE OF THE INFLUENCES OF HIS CHILDHOOD WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER FIELD HOUSEKEEPER OF BLAKESWARE HOUSE IN HERTFORDSHIRE
3618-175930-0016 AT WHICH MANSION HE SOMETIMES SPENT HIS HOLIDAYS YOU WILL KNOW THAT HE WAS A BACHELOR LIVING WITH HIS SISTER MARY WHO WAS SUBJECT TO HOMICIDAL MANIA AND YOU WILL SEE IN THIS ESSAY PRIMARILY
3618-175930-0017 A SUPREME EXPRESSION OF THE INCREASING LONELINESS OF HIS LIFE HE CONSTRUCTED ALL THAT PRELIMINARY TABLEAU OF PATERNAL PLEASURE IN ORDER TO BRING HOME TO YOU IN THE MOST POIGNANT WAY
3618-175930-0018 HIS FEELING OF THE SOLITUDE OF HIS EXISTENCE HIS SENSE OF ALL THAT HE HAD MISSED AND LOST IN THE WORLD THE KEY OF THE ESSAY IS ONE OF PROFOUND SADNESS
3618-175930-0019 BUT NOTE THAT HE MAKES HIS SADNESS BEAUTIFUL OR RATHER HE SHOWS THE BEAUTY THAT RESIDES IN SADNESS YOU WATCH HIM SITTING THERE IN HIS BACHELOR ARM CHAIR AND YOU SAY TO YOURSELF
3618-175930-0020 YES IT WAS SAD BUT IT WAS SOMEHOW BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU HAVE SAID THAT TO YOURSELF CHARLES LAMB SO FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED HAS ACCOMPLISHED HIS CHIEF AIM IN WRITING THE ESSAY
3618-175930-0021 HOW EXACTLY HE PRODUCES HIS EFFECT CAN NEVER BE FULLY EXPLAINED BUT ONE REASON OF HIS SUCCESS IS CERTAINLY HIS REGARD FOR TRUTH HE DOES NOT FALSELY IDEALISE HIS BROTHER NOR THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THEM
3618-175930-0022 NOT THE SLIGHTEST CLOUD EVER DARKENED OUR RELATIONS NOR DOES HE EXAGGERATE HIS SOLITUDE BEING A SANE MAN HE HAS TOO MUCH COMMON SENSE TO ASSEMBLE ALL HIS WOES AT ONCE
3618-175930-0023 WHAT HE DOES TELL YOU IS THAT SHE WAS FAITHFUL ANOTHER REASON OF HIS SUCCESS IS HIS CONTINUAL REGARD FOR BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND FINE ACTIONS AS ILLUSTRATED IN THE MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS GRANDMOTHER AND HIS BROTHER
3618-175930-0024 AND IN THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF BLAKESWARE HOUSE AND THE GARDENS THEREOF THEN SUBORDINATE TO THE MAIN PURPOSE PART OF THE MACHINERY OF THE MAIN PURPOSE IS THE PICTURE OF THE CHILDREN REAL CHILDREN UNTIL
3618-175930-0025 THE MOMENT WHEN THEY FADE AWAY THE TRAITS OF CHILDHOOD ARE ACCURATELY AND HUMOROUSLY PUT IN AGAIN AND AGAIN
3618-175930-0026 THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH INDEED HERE LITTLE ALICE SPREAD HER HANDS HERE ALICE'S LITTLE RIGHT FOOT PLAYED AN INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT TILL UPON MY LOOKING GRAVE IT DESISTED
3618-175930-0027 HERE JOHN EXPANDED ALL HIS EYEBROWS AND TRIED TO LOOK COURAGEOUS HERE JOHN SLILY DEPOSITED BACK UPON THE PLATE A BUNCH OF GRAPES HERE THE CHILDREN FELL A CRYING AND PRAYED ME TO TELL THEM SOME STORIES ABOUT THEIR PRETTY DEAD MOTHER
3618-175930-0028 AND THE EXQUISITE HERE ALICE PUT OUT ONE OF HER DEAR MOTHER'S LOOKS TOO TENDER TO BE UPBRAIDING INCIDENTALLY WHILE PREPARING HIS ULTIMATE SOLEMN EFFECT
3618-175930-0029 LAMB HAS INSPIRED YOU WITH A NEW INTENSIFIED VISION OF THE WISTFUL BEAUTY OF CHILDREN
3618-175930-0030 THEIR FACILE AND GENEROUS EMOTIONS THEIR ANXIETY TO BE CORRECT THEIR INGENUOUS HASTE TO ESCAPE FROM GRIEF INTO JOY YOU CAN SEE THESE CHILDREN ALMOST AS CLEARLY AND AS TENDERLY AS LAMB SAW THEM FOR DAYS AFTERWARDS
3618-175930-0031 YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOOK UPON A CHILD WITHOUT RECALLING LAMB'S PORTRAYAL OF THE GRACE OF CHILDHOOD HE WILL HAVE SHARED WITH YOU HIS PERCEPTION OF BEAUTY IF YOU POSSESS CHILDREN
3618-175930-0032 CUSTOM DOES VERY DECIDEDLY STALE
3618-175930-0033 PICTURING THE CHILDREN IS THE MEASURE OF HIS SUCCESS IN HIS MAIN EFFECT THE MORE REAL THEY SEEM THE MORE TOUCHING IS THE REVELATION OF THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT EXIST AND NEVER HAVE EXISTED AND IF YOU WERE MOVED BY THE REFERENCE TO THEIR PRETTY DEAD MOTHER
3618-175930-0034 YOU WILL BE STILL MORE MOVED WHEN YOU LEARN THAT THE GIRL
3618-175930-0035 AND IS NOT LAMB'S AS HAVING READ THE ESSAY YOU REFLECT UPON IT YOU WILL SEE HOW ITS EMOTIONAL POWER OVER YOU HAS SPRUNG FROM THE SINCERE AND UNEXAGGERATED EXPRESSION OF
3618-175930-0036 ACTUAL EMOTIONS EXACTLY REMEMBERED BY SOMEONE WHO HAD AN EYE ALWAYS OPEN FOR BEAUTY WHO WAS INDEED OBSESSED BY BEAUTY THE BEAUTY OF OLD HOUSES AND GARDENS AND AGED VIRTUOUS CHARACTERS
3618-175930-0037 THE BEAUTY OF COMPANIONSHIPS THE SOFTENING BEAUTY OF DREAMS IN AN ARM CHAIR
3618-175930-0038 AND REGRET WHICH WERE THE ORIGIN OF THE MOOD
3618-175930-0039 AS TO GENERATIONS BEFORE YOU DISTINGUISHED EMOTION BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU RESPOND TO THE THROB OF LIFE MORE INTENSELY
3618-175930-0040 A VERY SENSITIVE AND A VERY HONEST MIND HIS EMOTIONS WERE NOBLE HE FELT SO KEENLY THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO FIND RELIEF IN IMPARTING HIS EMOTIONS AND HIS MENTAL PROCESSES WERE SO SINCERE
3618-175930-0041 THAT HE COULD NEITHER EXAGGERATE NOR DIMINISH THE TRUTH IF HE HAD LACKED ANY ONE OF THESE THREE QUALITIES HIS APPEAL WOULD HAVE BEEN NARROWED AND WEAKENED
3618-175930-0042 EITHER HIS FEELINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEFICIENT IN SUPREME BEAUTY AND THEREFORE LESS WORTHY TO BE IMPARTED OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD SUFFICIENT FORCE TO IMPART THEM OR HIS HONESTY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN EQUAL TO THE STRAIN OF IMPARTING THEM ACCURATELY IN ANY CASE
3618-175930-0043 AND WHICH IS SUPER EMINENTLY CAUSED BY VITALISING PARTICIPATION IN HIGH EMOTION AS LAMB SAT IN HIS BACHELOR ARM CHAIR WITH HIS BROTHER IN THE GRAVE AND THE FAITHFUL HOMICIDAL MANIAC BY HIS SIDE
3618-175930-0044 HE REALLY DID THINK TO HIMSELF THIS IS BEAUTIFUL SORROW IS BEAUTIFUL DISAPPOINTMENT IS BEAUTIFUL LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL I MUST TELL THEM I MUST MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND
3618-175930-0045 BECAUSE HE STILL MAKES YOU UNDERSTAND HE IS A CLASSIC
