28-12332-0000 THE ADVENTURE OF THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY
28-12332-0001 I NATURALLY MADE UP MY MIND TO GO ROUND THE WORLD IT WAS MY STEPFATHER'S DEATH THAT DROVE ME TO IT I HAD NEVER SEEN MY STEPFATHER INDEED
28-12332-0002 I OWED HIM NOTHING EXCEPT MY POVERTY HE MARRIED MY DEAR MOTHER WHEN I WAS A GIRL AT SCHOOL IN SWITZERLAND AND HE PROCEEDED TO SPEND HER LITTLE FORTUNE LEFT AT HER SOLE DISPOSAL BY MY FATHER'S WILL IN PAYING HIS GAMBLING DEBTS
28-12332-0003 AFTER THAT HE CARRIED MY DEAR MOTHER OFF TO BURMA AND WHEN HE AND THE CLIMATE BETWEEN THEM HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING HER HE MADE UP FOR HIS APPROPRIATIONS AT THE CHEAPEST RATE BY ALLOWING ME JUST ENOUGH TO SEND ME TO GIRTON
28-12332-0004 SO WHEN THE COLONEL DIED IN THE YEAR I WAS LEAVING COLLEGE I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO GO INTO MOURNING FOR HIM ESPECIALLY AS HE CHOSE THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN MY ALLOWANCE WAS DUE
28-12332-0005 OF COURSE YOU WILL TEACH SAID ELSIE PETHERIDGE WHEN I EXPLAINED MY AFFAIRS TO HER THERE IS A GOOD DEMAND JUST NOW FOR HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS I LOOKED AT HER AGHAST TEACH ELSIE
28-12332-0006 NATURE DID NOT CUT ME OUT FOR A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I COULDN'T SWALLOW A POKER IF I TRIED FOR WEEKS POKERS DON'T AGREE WITH ME BETWEEN OURSELVES I AM A BIT OF A REBEL YOU ARE BROWNIE SHE ANSWERED
28-12332-0007 PAUSING IN HER PAPERING WITH HER SLEEVES ROLLED UP THEY CALLED ME BROWNIE PARTLY BECAUSE OF MY DARK COMPLEXION BUT PARTLY BECAUSE THEY COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND ME WE ALL KNEW THAT LONG AGO
28-12332-0008 I LAID DOWN THE PASTE BRUSH AND MUSED DO YOU REMEMBER ELSIE I SAID STARING HARD AT THE PAPER BOARD WHEN I FIRST WENT TO GIRTON HOW ALL YOU GIRLS WORE YOUR HAIR QUITE STRAIGHT IN NEAT SMOOTH COILS
28-12332-0009 AND YET AFTER ALL THERE ISN'T MUCH HARM IN YOU I HOPE NOT I SAID DEVOUTLY I WAS BEFORE MY TIME THAT WAS ALL AT PRESENT EVEN A CURATE'S WIFE MAY BLAMELESSLY BICYCLE
28-12332-0010 BUT IF YOU DON'T TEACH ELSIE WENT ON GAZING AT ME WITH THOSE WONDERING BIG BLUE EYES OF HERS WHATEVER WILL YOU DO BROWNIE HER HORIZON WAS BOUNDED BY THE SCHOLASTIC CIRCLE
28-12332-0011 I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA I ANSWERED CONTINUING TO PASTE ONLY AS I CAN'T TRESPASS UPON YOUR ELEGANT HOSPITALITY FOR LIFE
28-12332-0012 WHEN WE'VE FINISHED THE PAPERING I COULDN'T TEACH TEACHING LIKE MAUVE IS THE REFUGE OF THE INCOMPETENT AND I DON'T IF POSSIBLE WANT TO SELL BONNETS AS A MILLINER'S GIRL
28-12332-0013 THOUGH IT LOOKS AT FIRST SIGHT LIKE MUDDY FLAGSTONES LONDON THE GREATEST AND RICHEST CITY IN THE WORLD WHERE AN ADVENTUROUS SOUL OUGHT SURELY TO FIND SOME LOOPHOLE FOR AN ADVENTURE THAT PIECE IS HUNG CROOKED DEAR
28-12332-0014 WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE IT DOWN AGAIN I DEVISE A PLAN THEREFORE I SUBMIT MYSELF TO FATE OR IF YOU PREFER IT I LEAVE MY FUTURE IN THE HANDS OF PROVIDENCE I SHALL STROLL OUT THIS MORNING
28-12332-0015 AS SOON AS I'VE CLEANED MYSELF AND EMBRACE THE FIRST STRAY ENTERPRISE THAT OFFERS OUR BAGDAD TEEMS WITH ENCHANTED CARPETS LET ONE BUT FLOAT MY WAY AND HI PRESTO I SEIZE IT
28-12332-0016 WHAT WILL YOU DO TO FIND ONE PUT ON MY HAT AND WALK OUT I ANSWERED NOTHING COULD BE SIMPLER THIS CITY BURSTS WITH ENTERPRISES AND SURPRISES
28-12332-0017 OMNIBUSES TRAVERSE IT FROM END TO END EVEN I AM TOLD TO ISLINGTON AND PUTNEY WITHIN FOLK SIT FACE TO FACE WHO NEVER SAW ONE ANOTHER BEFORE IN THEIR LIVES AND WHO MAY NEVER SEE ONE ANOTHER AGAIN OR ON THE CONTRARY
28-12332-0018 MAY PASS THE REST OF THEIR DAYS TOGETHER I HAD A LOVELY HARANGUE ALL PAT IN MY HEAD IN MUCH THE SAME STRAIN ON THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES OF ENTERTAINING ANGELS UNAWARES IN CABS ON THE UNDERGROUND
28-12332-0019 BUT ELSIE'S WIDENING EYES OF HORROR PULLED ME UP SHORT LIKE A HANSOM IN PICCADILLY WHEN THE INEXORABLE UPTURNED HAND OF THE POLICEMAN CHECKS IT OH BROWNIE
28-12332-0020 YOU NEVER WILL LEARN WHAT I MEAN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE NO NO I AM GOING OUT SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE WHAT ADVENTURE MAY COME I HAVE NOT AT THIS MOMENT THE FAINTEST CONCEPTION
28-12332-0021 I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO ONE ELSIE PUT IN GRACIOUS HEAVENS NEITHER HAVE I WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU TAKE ME FOR BUT I MEAN TO SEE WHERE FATE WILL LEAD ME I MAY GO WITH YOU ELSIE PLEADED
28-12332-0022 CERTAINLY NOT MY CHILD I ANSWERED SHE WAS THREE YEARS OLDER THAN I SO I HAD THE RIGHT TO PATRONISE HER THAT WOULD SPOIL ALL YOUR DEAR LITTLE FACE WOULD BE QUITE ENOUGH TO SCARE AWAY A TIMID ADVENTURE
28-12332-0023 SHE KNEW WHAT I MEANT IT WAS GENTLE AND PENSIVE BUT IT LACKED INITIATIVE SO WHEN WE HAD FINISHED THAT WALL I POPPED ON MY BEST HAT AND POPPED OUT BY MYSELF INTO KENSINGTON GARDENS
28-12332-0024 I AM TOLD I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY ALARMED AT THE STRAITS IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF A GIRL OF TWENTY ONE ALONE IN THE WORLD
28-12332-0025 WITHOUT A FRIEND TO PROTECT A RELATION TO COUNSEL HER I DON'T COUNT AUNT SUSAN WHO LURKED IN LADYLIKE INDIGENCE AT BLACKHEATH AND WHOSE COUNSEL LIKE HER TRACTS WAS GIVEN AWAY TOO PROFUSELY TO EVERYBODY
28-12332-0026 TO ALLOW OF ONE'S PLACING ANY VERY HIGH VALUE UPON IT BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT I MUST ADMIT I WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALARMED NATURE HAD ENDOWED ME WITH A PROFUSION OF CRISP BLACK HAIR AND PLENTY OF HIGH SPIRITS
28-12332-0027 IF MY EYES HAD BEEN LIKE ELSIE'S THAT LIQUID BLUE WHICH LOOKS OUT UPON LIFE WITH MINGLED PITY AND AMAZEMENT I MIGHT HAVE FELT AS A GIRL OUGHT TO FEEL UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS BUT HAVING LARGE DARK EYES WITH A BIT OF A TWINKLE IN THEM
28-12332-0028 AND BEING AS WELL ABLE TO PILOT A BICYCLE AS ANY GIRL OF MY ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE INHERITED OR ACQUIRED AN OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD WHICH DISTINCTLY LEANS RATHER TOWARDS CHEERINESS THAN DESPONDENCY I CROAK WITH DIFFICULTY
28-12332-0029 SO I ACCEPTED MY PLIGHT AS AN AMUSING EXPERIENCE AFFORDING FULL SCOPE FOR THE CONGENIAL EXERCISE OF COURAGE AND INGENUITY HOW BOUNDLESS ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF KENSINGTON GARDENS THE ROUND POND
28-12332-0030 AND ON THE SOUTH BY THE AMPHITHEATRE OF THE ALBERT HALL BUT FOR A CENTRE OF ADVENTURE I CHOOSE THE LONG WALK IT BECKONED ME SOMEWHAT AS THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE BECKONED MY SEAFARING ANCESTORS
28-12332-0031 THE BUCCANEERING MARINERS OF ELIZABETHAN DEVON I SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR AT THE FOOT OF AN OLD ELM WITH A POETIC HOLLOW PROSAICALLY FILLED BY A UTILITARIAN PLATE OF GALVANISED IRON
28-12332-0032 TWO ANCIENT LADIES WERE SEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE ALREADY VERY GRAND LOOKING DAMES WITH THE HAUGHTY AND EXCLUSIVE UGLINESS OF THE ENGLISH ARISTOCRACY IN ITS LATER STAGES
28-12332-0033 COMMEND ME TO THE NOBLE DOWAGER
28-12332-0034 SHE WORE COFFEE COLOURED POINT LACE IN HER BONNET WITH A COMPLEXION TO MATCH BUT WHAT COULD I DO MY DEAR I SIMPLY COULDN'T PUT UP WITH SUCH INSOLENCE SO I LOOKED HER STRAIGHT BACK IN THE FACE OH SHE QUAILED I CAN TELL YOU
28-12332-0035 AND I SAID TO HER IN MY ICIEST VOICE YOU KNOW HOW ICY I CAN BE WHEN OCCASION DEMANDS IT' THE SECOND OLD LADY NODDED AN UNGRUDGING ASSENT AS IF PERFECTLY PREPARED TO ADMIT HER FRIEND'S RARE GIFT OF ICINESS
28-12332-0036 AND HALF AN HOUR TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE AND SHE DROPPED ME A DEEP REVERENCE AND SHE ANSWERED OUI MADAME MERCI BEAUCOUP MADAME JE NE DESIRE PAS MIEUX MADAME AND OUT SHE FLOUNCED SO THERE WAS THE END OF IT
28-12332-0037 STILL YOU GO TO SCHLANGENBAD ON MONDAY THAT'S THE POINT ON MONDAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE JOURNEY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD ENOUGH TO BE RID OF THE MINX I'M GLAD AS IT IS INDEED
28-12332-0038 FOR A MORE INSOLENT UPSTANDING INDEPENDENT ANSWER YOU BACK AGAIN YOUNG WOMAN WITH A SNEER OF HER OWN I NEVER SAW AMELIA BUT I MUST GET TO SCHLANGENBAD NOW THERE THE DIFFICULTY COMES IN ON THE ONE HAND
28-12332-0039 YOU HAVE TO WAIT UPON HER INSTEAD OF HER WAITING UPON YOU SHE GETS SEASICK ON THE CROSSING AND WHEN SHE REACHES FRANCE OR GERMANY SHE HATES THE MEALS AND SHE DETESTS THE HOTEL SERVANTS AND SHE CAN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
28-12332-0040 SO THAT SHE'S ALWAYS CALLING YOU IN TO INTERPRET FOR HER IN HER PRIVATE DIFFERENCES WITH THE FILLE DE CHAMBRE AND THE LANDLORD OR ELSE I MUST PICK UP A FRENCH MAID IN LONDON AND I KNOW EQUALLY BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE FRENCH MAIDS ONE ENGAGES IN LONDON
28-12332-0041 ARE INVARIABLY DISHONEST MORE DISHONEST THAN THE REST EVEN
28-12332-0042 THEN AGAIN ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN'T WAIT TO GET A GRETCHEN AN UNSOPHISTICATED LITTLE GRETCHEN OF THE TAUNUS AT SCHLANGENBAD I SUPPOSE THERE ARE UNSOPHISTICATED GIRLS IN GERMANY STILL MADE IN GERMANY
28-12332-0043 THEY DON'T MAKE EM ANY LONGER IN ENGLAND I'M SURE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THE TRADE IN RUSTIC INNOCENCE HAS BEEN DRIVEN FROM THE COUNTRY I CAN'T WAIT TO GET A GRETCHEN AS I SHOULD LIKE TO DO OF COURSE
28-12332-0044 BECAUSE I SIMPLY DAREN'T UNDERTAKE TO CROSS THE CHANNEL ALONE AND GO ALL THAT LONG JOURNEY
28-12332-0045 TO SCHLANGENBAD YOU COULD GET A TEMPORARY MAID HER FRIEND SUGGESTED IN A LULL OF THE TORNADO THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY FLARED UP YES AND HAVE MY JEWEL CASE STOLEN
28-12332-0046 OR FIND SHE WAS AN ENGLISH GIRL WITHOUT ONE WORD OF GERMAN OR NURSE HER ON THE BOAT WHEN I WANT TO GIVE MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION TO MY OWN MISFORTUNES NO AMELIA I CALL IT POSITIVELY UNKIND OF YOU TO SUGGEST SUCH A THING YOU'RE SO UNSYMPATHETIC
28-12332-0047 I PUT MY FOOT DOWN THERE I WILL NOT TAKE ANY TEMPORARY PERSON I SAW MY CHANCE THIS WAS A DELIGHTFUL IDEA WHY NOT START FOR SCHLANGENBAD WITH THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY
28-12332-0048 OF COURSE I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF TAKING A LADY'S MAID'S PLACE FOR A PERMANENCY NOR EVEN IF IT COMES TO THAT AS A PASSING EXPEDIENT BUT IF I WANTED TO GO ROUND THE WORLD
28-12332-0049 HOW COULD I DO BETTER THAN SET OUT BY THE RHINE COUNTRY THE RHINE LEADS YOU ON TO THE DANUBE THE DANUBE TO THE BLACK SEA THE BLACK SEA TO ASIA AND SO BY WAY OF INDIA CHINA AND JAPAN YOU REACH THE PACIFIC AND SAN FRANCISCO
28-12332-0050 I SAID IN MY SUAVEST VOICE BUT I THINK I SEE A WAY OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTY MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY WOULD GO OFF IN A FIT OF APOPLEXY
28-12332-0051 SHE GREW PURPLE IN THE FACE WITH INDIGNATION AND ASTONISHMENT THAT A CASUAL OUTSIDER SHOULD VENTURE TO ADDRESS HER SO MUCH SO INDEED
28-12332-0052 THEN SHE SCANNED ME UP AND DOWN AS IF I WERE A GIRL IN A MANTLE SHOP AND SHE CONTEMPLATED BUYING EITHER ME OR THE MANTLE AT LAST CATCHING MY EYE SHE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND BURST OUT LAUGHING
28-12332-0053 SHE ASKED I FLUSHED UP IN TURN THIS IS A PUBLIC PLACE I REPLIED WITH DIGNITY AND YOU SPOKE IN A TONE WHICH WAS HARDLY DESIGNED FOR THE STRICTEST PRIVACY
28-12332-0054 IF YOU DON'T WISH TO BE OVERHEARD YOU OUGHTN'T TO SHOUT BESIDES I DESIRED TO DO YOU A SERVICE THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY REGARDED ME ONCE MORE FROM HEAD TO FOOT I DID NOT QUAIL THEN
28-12332-0055 THE GIRL HAS SPIRIT SHE REMARKED IN AN ENCOURAGING TONE AS IF SHE WERE DISCUSSING SOME ABSENT PERSON UPON MY WORD AMELIA I RATHER LIKE THE LOOK OF HER WELL MY GOOD WOMAN
28-12332-0056 I DON'T OBJECT TO GOING TO SCHLANGENBAD I WOULD CONVOY YOU OVER AS COMPANION OR LADY HELP OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU CHOOSE TO CALL IT I WOULD REMAIN WITH YOU THERE FOR A WEEK TILL YOU COULD ARRANGE WITH YOUR GRETCHEN PRESUMABLY UNSOPHISTICATED
