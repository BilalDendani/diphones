4991-6180-0000 SHE SAW BEFORE HER IN THE DUSK OF THE THICK WOOD A GROUP OF SOME DOZEN WOLVES AND HYENAS STANDING ALL TOGETHER RIGHT IN HER WAY WITH THEIR GREEN EYES FIXED UPON HER STARING SHE FALTERED ONE STEP
4991-6180-0001 AND KEEPING STRAIGHT ON DASHED RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEM THEY FLED HOWLING AS IF SHE HAD STRUCK THEM WITH FIRE SHE WAS NO MORE AFRAID AFTER THAT AND ERE THE SUN WAS UP
4991-6180-0002 WHICH NO BAD THING COULD STEP UPON AND LIVE WITH THE FIRST PEEP OF THE SUN ABOVE THE HORIZON SHE SAW THE LITTLE COTTAGE BEFORE HER
4991-6180-0003 WHEN SHE CAME NEAR IT SHE SAW THAT THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND RAN STRAIGHT INTO THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS OF THE WISE WOMAN THE WISE WOMAN KISSED HER AND STROKED HER HAIR SET HER DOWN BY THE FIRE
4991-6180-0004 AND GAVE HER A BOWL OF BREAD AND MILK WHEN SHE HAD EATEN IT SHE DREW HER BEFORE HER WHERE SHE SAT AND SPOKE TO HER THUS ROSAMOND IF YOU WOULD BE A BLESSED CREATURE INSTEAD OF A MERE WRETCH
4991-6180-0005 YOU MUST SUBMIT TO BE TRIED IS THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE ASKED THE PRINCESS TURNING WHITE NO MY CHILD BUT IT IS SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT TO COME WELL OUT OF
4991-6180-0006 NOBODY WHO HAS NOT BEEN TRIED KNOWS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS BUT WHOEVER HAS COME WELL OUT OF IT AND THOSE WHO DO NOT OVERCOME NEVER DO COME OUT OF IT
4991-6180-0007 AND BEING STILL THE SAME MISERABLE CREATURE AS BEFORE
4991-6180-0008 I WILL NOT TELL YOU EXACTLY BUT I WILL TELL YOU SOME THINGS TO HELP YOU ONE GREAT DANGER IS THAT PERHAPS YOU WILL THINK YOU ARE IN IT BEFORE IT HAS REALLY BEGUN

4991-6180-0015 A PRINCESS IS ABLE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT EVEN SHOULD SHE UNHAPPILY BE IN A MOOD THAT WOULD MAKE ANOTHER UNABLE TO DO IT FOR INSTANCE IF YOU SHOULD BE CROSS AND ANGRY

4991-6180-0031 BUT THE RABBIT LOOKED VERY LIMP AND ODD
4991-6180-0032 THE NEXT MOMENT SHE REMOVED IT FROM HER FACE AND ROSAMOND BEHELD NOT HER NURSE BUT THE WISE WOMAN STANDING ON HER OWN HEARTH WHILE SHE HERSELF STOOD BY THE DOOR
4991-6180-0033 LEADING FROM THE COTTAGE INTO THE HALL FIRST TRIAL A FAILURE SAID THE WISE WOMAN QUIETLY

4991-6180-0037 OPENED THE SAME DOOR AND CLOSED IT AFTER HER THE PRINCESS EXPECTED TO FIND HERSELF AGAIN IN THE NURSERY BUT IN THE WISE WOMAN'S HOUSE NO ONE EVER HAS THE SAME TRIAL TWICE
4991-6180-0038 SHE WAS IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN FULL OF BLOSSOMING TREES AND THE LOVELIEST ROSES AND LILIES A LAKE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WITH A TINY BOAT SO DELIGHTFUL WAS IT THAT ROSAMOND FORGOT ALL
4991-6180-0039 ABOUT HOW OR WHY SHE HAD COME THERE AND LOST HERSELF IN THE JOY OF THE FLOWERS AND THE TREES AND THE WATER PRESENTLY CAME THE SHOUT OF A CHILD MERRY AND GLAD
4991-6180-0040 RUSHED A LOVELY LITTLE BOY WITH HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT TO HER SHE WAS CHARMED AT THE SIGHT RAN TO MEET HIM CAUGHT HIM UP IN HER ARMS KISSED HIM
4991-6180-0041 SHE FOLLOWED HE MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE BOAT
4991-6180-0042 THEN HE CAUGHT UP THE LITTLE BOAT HOOK AND PUSHED AWAY FROM THE SHORE THERE WAS A GREAT WHITE FLOWER FLOATING A FEW YARDS OFF AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE FELLOW'S GOAL BUT ALAS NO SOONER HAD ROSAMOND CAUGHT SIGHT OF IT
4991-6180-0043 HUGE AND GLOWING AS A HARVEST MOON THAN SHE FELT A GREAT DESIRE TO HAVE IT HERSELF THE BOY HOWEVER WAS IN THE BOWS OF THE BOAT AND CAUGHT IT FIRST
4991-6180-0044 AND FOR A MOMENT HE TUGGED AT IT IN VAIN BUT AT LAST IT GAVE WAY SO SUDDENLY THAT HE TUMBLED BACK WITH THE FLOWER INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT THEN ROSAMOND ALMOST WILD AT THE DANGER IT WAS IN
4991-6180-0045 AS HE STRUGGLED TO RISE HURRIED TO SAVE IT BUT SOMEHOW BETWEEN THEM IT CAME IN PIECES
4991-6180-0046 WHEN THE BOY GOT UP AND SAW THE RUIN HIS COMPANION HAD OCCASIONED HE BURST INTO TEARS AND HAVING THE LONG STALK OF THE FLOWER STILL IN HIS HAND STRUCK HER WITH IT ACROSS THE FACE IT DID NOT HURT HER MUCH
4991-6180-0047 FOR HE WAS A VERY LITTLE FELLOW BUT IT WAS WET AND SLIMY SHE TUMBLED RATHER THAN RUSHED AT HIM SEIZED HIM IN HER ARMS TORE HIM FROM HIS FRIGHTENED GRASP AND FLUNG HIM INTO THE WATER
4991-6180-0048 HIS HEAD STRUCK ON THE BOAT AS HE FELL AND HE SANK AT ONCE TO THE BOTTOM
4991-6180-0049 WITH WHITE FACE AND OPEN EYES THE MOMENT SHE SAW THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER DEED SHE WAS FILLED WITH HORRIBLE DISMAY SHE TRIED HARD TO REACH DOWN TO HIM THROUGH THE WATER
4991-6180-0050 BUT IT WAS FAR DEEPER THAN IT LOOKED AND SHE COULD NOT NEITHER COULD SHE GET HER EYES TO LEAVE THE WHITE FACE ITS EYES FASCINATED AND FIXED HERS AND THERE SHE LAY LEANING OVER THE BOAT
4991-6180-0051 AND SPRINGING TO HER FEET SHE SAW A LOVELY LADY COME RUNNING DOWN THE GRASS TO THE BRINK OF THE WATER WITH HER HAIR FLYING ABOUT HER HEAD
4991-6180-0052 BUT ROSAMOND COULD NOT ANSWER AND ONLY STARED AT THE LADY
4991-6180-0053 AT HER DROWNED BOY THEN THE LADY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE DEAD THING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER AND RUSHED IN AND PLUNGING DOWN STRUGGLED AND GROPED UNTIL SHE REACHED IT
4991-6180-0054 IN HER ARMS HIS HEAD HANGING BACK AND THE WATER STREAMING FROM HIM
4991-6180-0055 SHE SAID HOLDING THE BODY OUT TO HER AND THIS IS YOUR SECOND TRIAL AND ALSO A FAILURE THE DEAD CHILD MELTED AWAY FROM HER ARMS AND THERE SHE STOOD THE WISE WOMAN
4991-6180-0056 WITH ONE ARM WET UP TO THE SHOULDER SHE THREW HERSELF ON THE HEATHER BED AND WEPT FROM RELIEF AND VEXATION BOTH
4991-6180-0057 SHUT THE DOOR AND LEFT HER ALONE ROSAMOND WAS SOBBING SO THAT SHE DID NOT HEAR HER GO WHEN AT LENGTH SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT THE WISE WOMAN WAS GONE HER MISERY RETURNED AFRESH AND TENFOLD AND SHE WEPT AND WAILED
4991-6180-0058 THE HOURS PASSED THE SHADOWS OF EVENING BEGAN TO FALL AND THE WISE WOMAN
