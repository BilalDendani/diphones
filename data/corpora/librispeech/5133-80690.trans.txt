5133-80690-0000 DORANI ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED IN A CITY OF HINDUSTAN A SELLER OF SCENTS AND ESSENCES WHO HAD A VERY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER NAMED DORANI THIS MAIDEN HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS A FAIRY
5133-80690-0001 AND THE TWO WERE HIGH IN FAVOUR WITH INDRA THE KING OF FAIRYLAND BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO SING SO SWEETLY AND DANCE SO DEFTLY THAT NO ONE IN THE KINGDOM COULD EQUAL THEM FOR GRACE AND BEAUTY
5133-80690-0002 DORANI HAD THE MOST LOVELY HAIR IN THE WORLD FOR IT WAS LIKE SPUN GOLD AND THE SMELL OF IT WAS LIKE THE SMELL OF FRESH ROSES BUT HER LOCKS WERE SO LONG AND THICK
5133-80690-0003 THAT THE WEIGHT OF IT WAS OFTEN UNBEARABLE AND ONE DAY SHE CUT OFF A SHINING TRESS AND WRAPPING IT IN A LARGE LEAF THREW IT IN THE RIVER WHICH RAN JUST BELOW HER WINDOW NOW IT HAPPENED
5133-80690-0004 THAT THE KING'S SON WAS OUT HUNTING AND HAD GONE DOWN TO THE RIVER TO DRINK WHEN THERE FLOATED TOWARDS HIM A FOLDED LEAF FROM WHICH CAME A PERFUME OF ROSES THE PRINCE WITH IDLE CURIOSITY
5133-80690-0005 TOOK A STEP INTO THE WATER AND CAUGHT THE LEAF AS IT WAS SAILING BY HE OPENED IT AND WITHIN HE FOUND A LOCK OF HAIR LIKE SPUN GOLD AND FROM WHICH CAME A FAINT EXQUISITE ODOUR
5133-80690-0006 WHEN THE PRINCE REACHED HOME THAT DAY HE LOOKED SO SAD AND WAS SO QUIET THAT HIS FATHER WONDERED IF ANY ILL HAD BEFALLEN HIM
5133-80690-0007 THEN THE YOUTH TOOK FROM HIS BREAST THE TRESS OF HAIR WHICH HE HAD FOUND IN THE RIVER AND HOLDING IT UP TO THE LIGHT REPLIED SEE MY FATHER WAS EVER HAIR LIKE THIS
5133-80690-0008 AND DORANI HEARD OF IT WITH THE REST AND ONE DAY SHE SAID TO HER FATHER IF THE HAIR IS MINE AND THE KING REQUIRES ME TO MARRY HIS SON I MUST DO SO BUT REMEMBER YOU MUST TELL HIM THAT IF AFTER THE WEDDING
5133-80690-0009 I STAY ALL DAY AT THE PALACE EVERY NIGHT WILL BE SPENT IN MY OLD HOME THE OLD MAN LISTENED TO HER WITH AMAZEMENT BUT ANSWERED NOTHING AS HE KNEW SHE WAS WISER THAN HE OF COURSE THE HAIR WAS DORANI'S
5133-80690-0010 WHO SUMMONED THE SCENT SELLER AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WISHED FOR HIS DAUGHTER TO BE GIVEN IN MARRIAGE TO THE PRINCE THE FATHER BOWED HIS HEAD THREE TIMES TO THE GROUND AND REPLIED YOUR HIGHNESS IS OUR LORD
5133-80690-0011 THE MAIDEN ASKS THIS ONLY THAT IF AFTER THE WEDDING SHE STAYS ALL DAY AT THE PALACE SHE MAY GO BACK EACH NIGHT TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE THE KING THOUGHT THIS A VERY STRANGE REQUEST
5133-80690-0012 HIS SON'S AFFAIR AND THE GIRL WOULD SURELY SOON GET TIRED OF GOING TO AND FRO SO HE MADE NO DIFFICULTY AND EVERYTHING WAS SPEEDILY ARRANGED AND THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT REJOICINGS AT FIRST
5133-80690-0013 THE CONDITION ATTACHING TO HIS WEDDING WITH THE LOVELY DORANI TROUBLED THE PRINCE VERY LITTLE FOR HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST SEE HIS BRIDE ALL DAY BUT TO HIS DISMAY HE FOUND THAT SHE WOULD DO NOTHING BUT SIT THE WHOLE TIME UPON A STOOL
5133-80690-0014 WITH HER HEAD BOWED FORWARD UPON HER KNEES AND HE COULD NEVER PERSUADE HER TO SAY A SINGLE WORD
5133-80690-0015 AND EACH MORNING SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK SOON AFTER DAYBREAK AND YET NEVER A SOUND PASSED HER LIPS NOR DID SHE SHOW BY ANY SIGN THAT SHE SAW OR HEARD OR HEEDED HER HUSBAND
5133-80690-0016 ONE EVENING THE PRINCE VERY UNHAPPY AND TROUBLED WAS WANDERING IN AN OLD AND BEAUTIFUL GARDEN NEAR THE PALACE THE GARDENER WAS A VERY AGED MAN WHO HAD SERVED THE PRINCE'S GREAT GRANDFATHER
5133-80690-0017 AND WHEN HE SAW THE PRINCE HE CAME AND BOWED HIMSELF TO HIM AND SAID CHILD CHILD WHY DO YOU LOOK SO SAD IS AUGHT THE MATTER THEN THE PRINCE REPLIED I AM SAD OLD FRIEND
5133-80690-0018 BECAUSE I HAVE MARRIED A WIFE AS LOVELY AS THE STARS BUT SHE WILL NOT SPEAK TO ME AND I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO NIGHT AFTER NIGHT SHE LEAVES ME FOR HER FATHER'S HOUSE
5133-80690-0019 AND DAY AFTER DAY SHE SITS IN MINE AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE AND UTTERS NO WORD WHATEVER I MAY DO OR SAY THE OLD MAN STOOD THINKING FOR A MOMENT
5133-80690-0020 AND THEN HE HOBBLED OFF TO HIS OWN COTTAGE A LITTLE LATER HE CAME BACK TO THE PRINCE WITH FIVE OR SIX SMALL PACKETS WHICH HE PLACED IN HIS HANDS AND SAID TO MORROW WHEN YOUR BRIDE LEAVES THE PALACE
5133-80690-0021 SPRINKLE THE POWDER FROM ONE OF THESE PACKETS UPON YOUR BODY AND WHILE SEEING CLEARLY YOU WILL BECOME YOURSELF INVISIBLE MORE I CANNOT DO FOR YOU
5133-80690-0022 AND PUT THE PACKETS CAREFULLY AWAY IN HIS TURBAN THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN DORANI LEFT FOR HER FATHER'S HOUSE IN HER PALANQUIN THE PRINCE TOOK OUT A PACKET OF THE MAGIC POWDER AND SPRINKLED IT OVER HIMSELF AND THEN HURRIED AFTER HER
5133-80690-0023 HE SOON FOUND THAT AS THE OLD MAN HAD PROMISED HE WAS INVISIBLE TO EVERYONE ALTHOUGH HE FELT AS USUAL AND COULD SEE ALL THAT PASSED
5133-80690-0024 AND WALKED BESIDE IT TO THE SCENT SELLER'S DWELLING THERE IT WAS SET DOWN AND WHEN HIS BRIDE CLOSELY VEILED LEFT IT AND ENTERED THE HOUSE HE TOO ENTERED UNPERCEIVED AT THE FIRST DOOR DORANI REMOVED ONE VEIL
5133-80690-0025 THEN SHE ENTERED ANOTHER DOORWAY AT THE END OF A PASSAGE WHERE SHE REMOVED ANOTHER VEIL NEXT SHE MOUNTED THE STAIRS AND AT THE DOOR OF THE WOMEN'S QUARTERS REMOVED A THIRD VEIL AFTER THIS SHE PROCEEDED TO HER OWN ROOM
5133-80690-0026 ONE OF ATTAR OF ROSES AND ONE OF WATER IN THESE SHE WASHED HERSELF AND AFTERWARDS CALLED FOR FOOD A SERVANT BROUGHT HER A BOWL OF CURDS WHICH SHE ATE HASTILY AND THEN ARRAYED HERSELF
5133-80690-0027 IN A ROBE OF SILVER AND WOUND ABOUT HER STRINGS OF PEARLS WHILE A WREATH OF ROSES CROWNED HER HAIR WHEN FULLY DRESSED SHE SEATED HERSELF UPON A FOUR LEGGED STOOL OVER WHICH WAS A CANOPY WITH SILKEN CURTAINS
5133-80690-0028 THESE SHE DREW AROUND HER AND THEN CALLED OUT FLY STOOL TO THE PALACE OF RAJAH INDRA INSTANTLY THE STOOL ROSE IN THE AIR AND THE INVISIBLE PRINCE
5133-80690-0029 WHO HAD WATCHED ALL THESE PROCEEDINGS WITH GREAT WONDER SEIZED IT BY ONE LEG AS IT FLEW AWAY AND FOUND HIMSELF BEING BORNE THROUGH THE AIR AT A RAPID RATE IN A SHORT WHILE THEY ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE FAIRY
5133-80690-0030 WHO AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE WAS THE FAVOURITE FRIEND OF DORANI THE FAIRY STOOD WAITING ON THE THRESHOLD AS BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED AS DORANI HERSELF WAS AND WHEN THE STOOL STOPPED AT HER DOOR SHE CRIED IN ASTONISHMENT
5133-80690-0031 WHY THE STOOL IS FLYING ALL CROOKED TO DAY WHAT IS THE REASON OF THAT I WONDER
5133-80690-0032 AND SO IT WILL NOT FLY STRAIGHT BUT DORANI DECLARED THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD TO HIM AND SHE COULDN'T THINK WHY THE STOOL FLEW AS IF WEIGHED DOWN AT ONE SIDE THE FAIRY STILL LOOKED DOUBTFUL
5133-80690-0033 BUT MADE NO ANSWER AND TOOK HER SEAT BESIDE DORANI THE PRINCE AGAIN HOLDING TIGHTLY ONE LEG THEN THE STOOL FLEW ON THROUGH THE AIR UNTIL IT CAME TO THE PALACE OF INDRA THE RAJAH
5133-80690-0034 ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT THE WOMEN SANG AND DANCED BEFORE THE RAJAH INDRA WHILST A MAGIC LUTE PLAYED OF ITSELF THE MOST BEWITCHING MUSIC TILL THE PRINCE WHO SAT WATCHING IT ALL
5133-80690-0035 WAS QUITE ENTRANCED JUST BEFORE DAWN THE RAJAH GAVE THE SIGNAL TO CEASE AND AGAIN THE TWO WOMEN SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE STOOL AND WITH THE PRINCE CLINGING TO THE LEG IT FLEW BACK TO EARTH
5133-80690-0036 AND BORE DORANI AND HER HUSBAND SAFELY TO THE SCENT SELLER'S SHOP HERE THE PRINCE HURRIED AWAY BY HIMSELF PAST DORANI'S PALANQUIN WITH ITS SLEEPY BEARERS STRAIGHT ON TO THE PALACE AND AS HE PASSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS OWN ROOMS
5133-80690-0037 AND AS IT WAS ALL ABOUT YOU I AM GOING TO TELL IT YOU ALTHOUGH YOU HEED NOTHING THE GIRL INDEED TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIS WORDS
5133-80690-0038 THAT HAD HAPPENED THE EVENING BEFORE LEAVING OUT NO DETAIL OF ALL THAT HE HAD SEEN OR HEARD AND WHEN HE PRAISED HER SINGING AND HIS VOICE SHOOK A LITTLE DORANI JUST LOOKED AT HIM BUT SHE SAID NAUGHT
5133-80690-0039 THOUGH IN HER OWN MIND SHE WAS FILLED WITH WONDER
5133-80690-0040 COULD IT HAVE BEEN A DREAM HOW COULD HE HAVE LEARNT IN A DREAM
5133-80690-0041 STILL SHE KEPT SILENT ONLY SHE LOOKED THAT ONCE AT THE PRINCE AND THEN REMAINED ALL DAY AS BEFORE WITH HER HEAD BOWED UPON HER KNEES WHEN NIGHT CAME THE PRINCE AGAIN MADE HIMSELF INVISIBLE AND FOLLOWED HER
5133-80690-0042 THE SAME THINGS HAPPENED AGAIN AS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE BUT DORANI SANG
5133-80690-0043 TOLD DORANI ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE PRETENDING THAT HE HAD DREAMT OF IT DIRECTLY HE HAD FINISHED DORANI GAZED AT HIM AND SAID IS IT TRUE THAT YOU DREAMT THIS OR WERE YOU REALLY THERE
5133-80690-0044 I WAS THERE ANSWERED THE PRINCE BUT WHY DO YOU FOLLOW ME ASKED THE GIRL BECAUSE REPLIED THE PRINCE I LOVE YOU AND TO BE WITH YOU IS HAPPINESS
5133-80690-0045 THIS TIME DORANI'S EYELIDS QUIVERED BUT SHE SAID NO MORE AND WAS SILENT THE REST OF THE DAY HOWEVER IN THE EVENING JUST AS SHE WAS STEPPING INTO HER PALANQUIN
5133-80690-0046 SHE SAID TO THE PRINCE IF YOU LOVE ME PROVE IT BY NOT FOLLOWING ME TO NIGHT AND SO THE PRINCE DID AS SHE WISHED AND STAYED AT HOME THAT EVENING THE MAGIC STOOL FLEW SO UNSTEADILY
5133-80690-0047 THAT THEY COULD HARDLY KEEP THEIR SEATS AND AT LAST THE FAIRY EXCLAIMED THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON THAT IT SHOULD JERK LIKE THIS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO YOUR HUSBAND AND DORANI REPLIED
5133-80690-0048 YES I HAVE SPOKEN OH YES I HAVE SPOKEN BUT NO MORE WOULD SHE SAY THAT NIGHT DORANI SANG SO MARVELLOUSLY THAT AT THE END THE RAJAH INDRA ROSE UP
5133-80690-0049 AND VOWED THAT SHE MIGHT ASK WHAT SHE WOULD AND HE WOULD GIVE IT TO HER AT FIRST SHE WAS SILENT BUT WHEN HE PRESSED HER SHE ANSWERED GIVE ME THE MAGIC LUTE THE RAJAH WHEN HE HEARD THIS
5133-80690-0050 WAS DISPLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING MADE SO RASH A PROMISE BECAUSE THIS LUTE HE VALUED ABOVE ALL HIS POSSESSIONS
5133-80690-0051 YOU MUST NEVER COME HERE AGAIN SAID HE FOR ONCE HAVING ASKED SO MUCH HOW WILL YOU IN FUTURE BE CONTENT WITH SMALLER GIFTS DORANI BOWED HER HEAD SILENTLY AS SHE TOOK THE LUTE AND PASSED WITH THE FAIRY OUT OF THE GREAT GATE
5133-80690-0052 WHERE THE STOOL AWAITED THEM MORE UNSTEADILY THAN BEFORE IT FLEW BACK TO EARTH WHEN DORANI GOT TO THE PALACE THAT MORNING SHE ASKED THE PRINCE WHETHER HE HAD DREAMT AGAIN HE LAUGHED WITH HAPPINESS
5133-80690-0053 AND HE REPLIED NO BUT I BEGIN TO DREAM NOW NOT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST BUT OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE THAT DAY DORANI SAT VERY QUIETLY BUT SHE ANSWERED THE PRINCE WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER
5133-80690-0054 AND WHEN EVENING FELL AND WITH IT THE TIME FOR HER DEPARTURE SHE STILL SAT ON THEN THE PRINCE CAME CLOSE TO HER AND SAID SOFTLY ARE YOU NOT GOING TO YOUR HOUSE DORANI
5133-80690-0055 AT THAT SHE ROSE AND THREW HERSELF WEEPING INTO HIS ARMS WHISPERING GENTLY NEVER AGAIN MY LORD NEVER AGAIN WOULD I LEAVE THEE
5133-80690-0056 SO THE PRINCE WON HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE AND THOUGH THEY NEITHER OF THEM DEALT ANY FURTHER WITH FAIRIES AND THEIR MAGIC THEY LEARNT MORE DAILY OF THE MAGIC OF LOVE WHICH ONE MAY STILL LEARN
