1226-141279-0000 WHEN THE DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN HIMSELF AND ALEXIS WERE FIRST BEGINNING TO ASSUME AN ALARMING FORM THIS CHILD WAS NOW ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD BUT HE WAS OF A VERY WEAK AND SICKLY CONSTITUTION AND THE CZAR WATCHED HIM WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING
1226-141279-0001 HE WAS SEIZED WITH THE CONVULSIONS TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECT WHEN UNDER ANY STRONG EXCITEMENT HIS FACE WAS DISTORTED AND HIS NECK WAS TWISTED AND STIFFENED IN A MOST FRIGHTFUL MANNER
1226-141279-0002 HE COULD NOT ENDURE IT FOR THE SIGHT OF HER RENEWED SO VIVIDLY THE ANGUISH THAT HE FELT FOR THE LOSS OF THEIR CHILD THAT IT MADE THE CONVULSIONS AND THE SUFFERING WORSE THAN BEFORE IT IS SAID THAT ON THIS OCCASION
1226-141279-0003 PETER SHUT HIMSELF UP ALONE FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN HIS OWN CHAMBER WHERE HE LAY STRETCHED ON THE GROUND IN ANGUISH AND AGONY AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY BODY TO COME IN
1226-141279-0004 AND INCREASING THE POWER AND INFLUENCE OF HIS GOVERNMENT AMONG SURROUNDING NATIONS HE HAD NO FARTHER SERIOUS DIFFICULTY WITH THE OPPONENTS OF HIS POLICY THOUGH HE WAS ALWAYS UNDER APPREHENSIONS THAT DIFFICULTIES MIGHT ARISE AFTER HIS DEATH
1226-141279-0005 HE HAD THE RIGHT ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION OF THE MONARCHY TO DESIGNATE HIS OWN SUCCESSOR CHOOSING FOR THIS PURPOSE EITHER ONE OF HIS SONS OR ANY OTHER PERSON AND NOW SINCE BOTH HIS SONS WERE DEAD
1226-141279-0006 HIS MIND REVOLVED ANXIOUSLY THE QUESTION WHAT PROVISION HE SHOULD MAKE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE EMPIRE AFTER HIS DECEASE HE FINALLY CONCLUDED TO LEAVE IT IN THE HANDS OF CATHARINE HERSELF AND TO PREPARE THE WAY FOR THIS HE RESOLVED TO CAUSE HER
1226-141279-0007 NARASKIN WOULD BE APPOINTED TO THE SUCCESSION THE CZAR HIMSELF SAID NOTHING OF HIS INTENTION BUT WAITED UNTIL THE TIME SHOULD ARRIVE FOR CARRYING IT INTO EFFECT
1226-141279-0008 AND HAD EVEN REPEATEDLY ENCOUNTERED ALL THE DISCOMFORTS AND DANGERS OF THE CAMP IN FOLLOWING HIM IN HIS MILITARY CAMPAIGNS BY SO DOING SHE HAD RENDERED HIM THE MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE
1226-141279-0009 AND ON ONE OCCASION SHE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF SAVING HIS WHOLE ARMY FROM DESTRUCTION HE THEREFORE DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF JOINING HER WITH HIMSELF IN THE SUPREME POWER AND TO CELEBRATE THIS EVENT BY A SOLEMN CORONATION

1226-141279-0022 THE OBSEQUIES WERE SO PROTRACTED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN SIX WEEKS FROM THE DEATH OF THE CZAR BEFORE THE BODIES WERE FINALLY COMMITTED TO THE TOMB
1226-141279-0023 FOR HE WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE GREATEST AS WELL AS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MEN THAT EVER LIVED
1226-141279-0024 AND HE PURSUED THE WORK DURING HIS WHOLE LIFETIME THROUGH DANGERS DIFFICULTIES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS WHICH IT REQUIRED A SURPRISING DEGREE OF DETERMINATION AND ENERGY TO SURMOUNT
