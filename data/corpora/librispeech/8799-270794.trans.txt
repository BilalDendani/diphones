8799-270794-0000 TWENTY FIFTH LECTURE GENERAL THEORY OF THE NEUROSES FEAR AND ANXIETY PROBABLY YOU WILL TERM WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT ORDINARY NERVOUSNESS IN MY LAST LECTURE
8799-270794-0001 MOST FRAGMENTARY AND UNSATISFACTORY INFORMATION I KNOW THIS AND I THINK YOU WERE PROBABLY MOST SURPRISED THAT I DID NOT MENTION FEAR WHICH MOST NERVOUS PEOPLE COMPLAIN OF AND DESCRIBE AS THEIR GREATEST SOURCE OF SUFFERING
8799-270794-0002 IT CAN ATTAIN A TERRIBLE INTENSITY WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE WILDEST ENTERPRISES BUT I DO NOT WISH TO FALL SHORT OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN THIS MATTER I INTEND ON THE CONTRARY TO TREAT THE PROBLEM OF THE FEAR OF NERVOUS PEOPLE WITH GREAT ACCURACY
8799-270794-0003 AND TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOU AT SOME LENGTH FEAR ITSELF NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION EVERYONE HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THIS SENSATION OR MORE PRECISELY THIS EFFECT
8799-270794-0004 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE NEVER SERIOUSLY INQUIRED WHY THE NERVOUS SUFFERED SO MUCH MORE AND SO MUCH MORE INTENSELY UNDER THIS CONDITION PERHAPS IT WAS THOUGHT A MATTER OF COURSE IT IS USUAL TO CONFUSE THE WORDS NERVOUS
8799-270794-0005 AND ANXIOUS AS THOUGH THEY MEANT THE SAME THING THAT IS UNJUSTIFIABLE THERE ARE ANXIOUS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT NERVOUS AND NERVOUS PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM MANY SYMPTOMS BUT NOT FROM THE TENDENCY TO ANXIETY
8799-270794-0006 HOWEVER THAT MAY BE IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE PROBLEM OF FEAR IS THE MEETING POINT OF MANY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AN ENIGMA WHOSE COMPLETE SOLUTION WOULD CAST A FLOOD OF LIGHT UPON PSYCHIC LIFE
8799-270794-0007 I DO NOT CLAIM THAT I CAN FURNISH YOU WITH THIS COMPLETE SOLUTION BUT YOU WILL CERTAINLY EXPECT PSYCHOANALYSIS TO DEAL WITH THIS THEME IN A MANNER DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE
8799-270794-0008 THESE SCHOOLS SEEM TO BE INTERESTED PRIMARILY IN THE ANATOMICAL CAUSE OF THE CONDITION OF FEAR THEY SAY THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA IS IRRITATED AND THE PATIENT LEARNS THAT HE IS SUFFERING FROM NEUROSIS OF THE NERVUS VAGUE
8799-270794-0009 THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA IS A VERY SERIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL OBJECT I REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME AND TROUBLE I DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF IT YEARS AGO BUT TODAY
8799-270794-0010 I MUST SAY THAT I KNOW OF NOTHING MORE INDIFFERENT TO ME FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPREHENSION OF FEAR THAN KNOWLEDGE OF THE NERVE PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH THESE SENSATIONS MUST PASS ONE CAN TALK ABOUT FEAR FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING UPON NERVOUSNESS
8799-270794-0011 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND ME WITHOUT MORE ADO WHEN I TERM THIS FEAR REAL FEAR IN CONTRAST TO NEUROTIC FEAR REAL FEAR SEEMS QUITE RATIONAL AND COMPREHENSIBLE TO US
8799-270794-0012 HARM THAT IS EXPECTED AND FORESEEN IT IS RELATED TO THE FLIGHT REFLEX AND MAY BE REGARDED AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION
8799-270794-0013 WE DEEM IT QUITE A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THE SAVAGE FEARS A CANNON OR AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN WHILE THE WHITE MAN
8799-270794-0014 DOES NOT FEAR THESE THINGS AT OTHER TIMES SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE PROMULGATES FEAR BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THE DANGER EARLIER THE SAVAGE FOR INSTANCE WILL RECOIL BEFORE A FOOTPRINT IN THE WOODS MEANINGLESS TO THE UNINSTRUCTED
8799-270794-0015 WHICH REVEALS TO HIM THE PROXIMITY OF AN ANIMAL OF PREY THE EXPERIENCED SAILOR WILL NOTICE A LITTLE CLOUD WHICH TELLS HIM OF A COMING HURRICANE WITH TERROR WHILE TO THE PASSENGER IT SEEMS INSIGNIFICANT
8799-270794-0016 AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION WE MUST SAY TO OURSELVES THAT THE VERDICT ON REAL FEAR WHETHER IT BE RATIONAL OR PURPOSEFUL MUST BE THOROUGHLY REVISED
8799-270794-0017 FOR THE ONLY PURPOSEFUL BEHAVIOR IN THE FACE OF IMMINENT DANGER WOULD BE THE COOL APPRAISAL OF ONE'S OWN STRENGTH IN COMPARISON WITH THE EXTENT OF THE THREATENING DANGER AND THEN DECIDE WHICH WOULD PRESAGE A HAPPIER ENDING FLIGHT DEFENSE
8799-270794-0018 OR POSSIBLY EVEN ATTACK UNDER SUCH A PROCEEDING FEAR HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WOULD BE CONSUMMATED JUST AS WELL AND BETTER WITHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEAR YOU KNOW THAT IF FEAR IS TOO STRONG
8799-270794-0019 IT PROVES ABSOLUTELY USELESS AND PARALYZES EVERY ACTION EVEN FLIGHT GENERALLY THE REACTION AGAINST DANGER CONSISTS IN A MIXTURE OF FEAR AND RESISTANCE THE FRIGHTENED ANIMAL IS AFRAID AND FLEES
8799-270794-0020 BUT THE PURPOSEFUL FACTOR IN SUCH A CASE IS NOT FEAR BUT FLIGHT WE ARE THEREFORE TEMPTED TO CLAIM THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEAR IS NEVER PURPOSEFUL PERHAPS CLOSER EXAMINATION WILL GIVE US GREATER INSIGHT INTO THE FEAR SITUATION
8799-270794-0021 THE FIRST FACTOR IS THE EXPECTANCY OF DANGER WHICH EXPRESSES ITSELF IN HEIGHTENED SENSORY ATTENTION AND IN MOTOR TENSION THIS EXPECTANCY IS UNDOUBTEDLY ADVANTAGEOUS
8799-270794-0022 ITS ABSENCE MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES ON THE ONE HAND IT GIVES RISE TO MOTOR ACTIVITY PRIMARILY TO FLIGHT AND ON A HIGHER PLANE TO ACTIVE DEFENSE ON THE OTHER HAND
8799-270794-0023 IT GIVES RISE TO SOMETHING WHICH WE CONSIDER THE CONDITION OF FEAR IN SO FAR AS THE DEVELOPMENT IS STILL INCIPIENT AND IS RESTRICTED TO A MERE SIGNAL THE MORE UNDISTURBED THE CONVERSION OF THE READINESS TO BE AFRAID INTO ACTION
8799-270794-0024 THE MORE PURPOSEFUL THE ENTIRE PROCEEDING THE READINESS TO BE AFRAID SEEMS TO BE THE PURPOSEFUL ASPECT EVOLUTION OF FEAR ITSELF THE ELEMENT THAT DEFEATS ITS OWN OBJECT
8799-270794-0025 I AVOID ENTERING UPON A DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER OUR LANGUAGE MEANS THE SAME OR DISTINCT THINGS BY THE WORDS ANXIETY FEAR OR FRIGHT I THINK THAT ANXIETY IS USED IN CONNECTION WITH A CONDITION REGARDLESS OF ANY OBJECTIVE
8799-270794-0026 WHILE FEAR IS ESSENTIALLY DIRECTED TOWARD AN OBJECT FRIGHT ON THE OTHER HAND SEEMS REALLY TO POSSESS A SPECIAL MEANING WHICH EMPHASIZES THE EFFECTS OF A DANGER WHICH IS PRECIPITATED WITHOUT ANY EXPECTANCE OR READINESS OF FEAR
8799-270794-0027 THUS WE MIGHT SAY THAT ANXIETY PROTECTS MAN FROM FRIGHT YOU HAVE PROBABLY NOTICED THE AMBIGUITY AND VAGUENESS IN THE USE OF THE WORD ANXIETY
8799-270794-0028 GENERALLY ONE MEANS A SUBJECTIVE CONDITION CAUSED BY THE PERCEPTION THAT AN EVOLUTION OF FEAR HAS BEEN CONSUMMATED SUCH A CONDITION MAY BE CALLED AN EMOTION WHAT IS AN EMOTION IN THE DYNAMIC SENSE
8799-270794-0029 CERTAINLY SOMETHING VERY COMPLEX AN EMOTION IN THE FIRST PLACE INCLUDES INDEFINITE MOTOR INNERVATIONS OR DISCHARGES SECONDLY DEFINITE SENSATIONS WHICH MOREOVER ARE OF TWO KINDS
8799-270794-0030 THE PERCEPTION OF MOTOR ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY TAKEN PLACE AND THE DIRECT SENSATIONS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN WHICH GIVE THE EFFECT OF WHAT WE CALL ITS FEELING TONE
8799-270794-0031 BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT THE TRUE NATURE OF THE EMOTION HAS BEEN FATHOMED BY THESE ENUMERATIONS WE HAVE GAINED DEEPER INSIGHT INTO SOME EMOTIONS AND REALIZE THAT THE THREAD WHICH BINDS TOGETHER SUCH A COMPLEX AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED
8799-270794-0032 IS THE REPETITION OF A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE THIS EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE AN EARLY IMPRESSION OF A VERY GENERAL SORT WHICH BELONGS TO THE ANTECEDENT HISTORY OF THE SPECIES RATHER THAN TO THAT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE MORE CLEAR
8799-270794-0033 THE EMOTIONAL CONDITION HAS A STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO THAT OF AN HYSTERICAL ATTACK IT IS THE UPSHOT OF A REMINISCENCE THE HYSTERIC ATTACK THEN IS COMPARABLE TO A NEWLY FORMED INDIVIDUAL EMOTION
8799-270794-0034 THE NORMAL EMOTION TO AN HYSTERIA WHICH HAS BECOME A UNIVERSAL HERITAGE DO NOT ASSUME THAT WHAT I HAVE SAID HERE ABOUT EMOTIONS IS DERIVED FROM NORMAL PSYCHOLOGY ON THE CONTRARY
8799-270794-0035 THESE ARE CONCEPTIONS THAT HAVE GROWN UP WITH AND ARE AT HOME ONLY IN PSYCHOANALYSIS WHAT PSYCHOLOGY HAS TO SAY ABOUT EMOTIONS THE JAMES LANGE THEORY FOR INSTANCE
8799-270794-0036 AND CANNOT BE DISCUSSED OF COURSE WE DO NOT CONSIDER OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EMOTIONS VERY CERTAIN IT IS A PRELIMINARY ATTEMPT TO BECOME ORIENTED IN THIS OBSCURE REGION TO CONTINUE
8799-270794-0037 WE BELIEVE WE KNOW THE EARLY IMPRESSION WHICH THE EMOTION OF FEAR REPEATS WE THINK IT IS BIRTH ITSELF WHICH COMBINES THAT COMPLEX OF PAINFUL FEELINGS OF A DISCHARGE OF IMPULSES OF PHYSICAL SENSATIONS WHICH HAS BECOME THE PROTOTYPE
8799-270794-0038 FOR THE EFFECT OF DANGER TO LIFE AND IS EVER AFTER REPEATED WITHIN US AS A CONDITION OF FEAR THE TREMENDOUS HEIGHTENING OF IRRITABILITY THROUGH THE INTERRUPTION OF THE CIRCULATION INTERNAL RESPIRATION
8799-270794-0039 WAS AT THE TIME THE CAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF FEAR THE FIRST FEAR WAS THEREFORE TOXIC THE NAME ANXIETY ANGUSTIAL NARROWNESS EMPHASIZES THE CHARACTERISTIC TIGHTENING OF THE BREATH
8799-270794-0040 WHICH WAS AT THE TIME A CONSEQUENCE OF AN ACTUAL SITUATION AND IS HENCEFORTH REPEATED ALMOST REGULARLY IN THE EMOTION WE SHALL ALSO RECOGNIZE HOW SIGNIFICANT IT IS THAT THIS FIRST CONDITION OF FEAR APPEARED DURING THE SEPARATION FROM THE MOTHER
8799-270794-0041 OF COURSE WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE TENDENCY TO REPETITION OF THE FIRST CONDITION OF FEAR HAS BEEN SO DEEPLY INGRAINED IN THE ORGANISM THROUGH COUNTLESS GENERATIONS THAT NOT A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL CAN ESCAPE THE EMOTION OF FEAR
8799-270794-0042 NOT EVEN THE MYTHICAL MACDUFF WHO WAS CUT OUT OF HIS MOTHER'S WOMB AND THEREFORE DID NOT EXPERIENCE BIRTH ITSELF WE DO NOT KNOW THE PROTOTYPE OF THE CONDITION OF FEAR IN THE CASE OF OTHER MAMMALS AND SO WE DO NOT KNOW THE COMPLEX OF EMOTIONS
8799-270794-0043 THAT IN THEM IS THE EQUIVALENT OF OUR FEAR PERHAPS IT WILL INTEREST YOU TO HEAR HOW THE IDEA THAT BIRTH IS THE SOURCE AND PROTOTYPE OF THE EMOTION OF FEAR HAPPENED TO OCCUR TO ME SPECULATION PLAYS THE SMALLEST PART IN IT
8799-270794-0044 I BORROWED IT FROM THE NATIVE TRAIN OF THOUGHT OF THE PEOPLE MANY YEARS AGO WE WERE SITTING AROUND THE DINNER TABLE A NUMBER OF YOUNG PHYSICIANS
8799-270794-0045 A CANDIDATE WAS ASKED WHAT IT IMPLIED IF DURING DELIVERY THE FOECES OF THE NEWBORN WAS PRESENT IN THE DISCHARGE OF WATERS AND SHE ANSWERED PROMPTLY THE CHILD IS AFRAID SHE WAS LAUGHED AT AND FLUNKED
8799-270794-0046 BUT I SILENTLY TOOK HER PART AND BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT THE POOR WOMAN OF THE PEOPLE HAD WITH SOUND PERCEPTION REVEALED AN IMPORTANT CONNECTION PROCEEDING NOW TO NEUROTIC FEAR WHAT ARE ITS MANIFESTATIONS AND CONDITIONS
8799-270794-0047 INTERPRET EVERY COINCIDENCE AS AN EVIL OMEN AND ASCRIBE A DREADFUL MEANING TO ALL UNCERTAINTY MANY PERSONS WHO CANNOT BE TERMED ILL SHOW THIS TENDENCY TO ANTICIPATE DISASTER
8799-270794-0048 WE BLAME THEM FOR BEING OVER ANXIOUS OR PESSIMISTIC A STRIKING AMOUNT OF EXPECTANT FEAR IS CHARACTERISTIC OF A NERVOUS CONDITION WHICH I HAVE NAMED ANXIETY NEUROSIS AND WHICH I GROUP WITH THE TRUE NEUROSES
8799-270794-0049 A SECOND FORM OF FEAR IN CONTRAST TO THE ONE WE HAVE JUST DESCRIBED IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY MORE CIRCUMSCRIBED AND BOUND UP WITH CERTAIN OBJECTS OR SITUATIONS
8799-270794-0050 IT IS THE FEAR OF THE MANIFOLD AND FREQUENTLY VERY PECULIAR PHOBIAS STANLEY HALL THE DISTINGUISHED AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST HAS RECENTLY TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO PRESENT A WHOLE SERIES OF THESE PHOBIAS IN GORGEOUS GREEK TERMINOLOGY
8799-270794-0051 THEY SOUND LIKE THE ENUMERATION OF THE TEN EGYPTIAN PLAGUES EXCEPT THAT THEIR NUMBER EXCEEDS TEN BY FAR JUST LISTEN TO ALL THE THINGS WHICH MAY BECOME THE OBJECTS OF CONTENTS OF A PHOBIA DARKNESS OPEN AIR
8799-270794-0052 OPEN SQUARES CATS SPIDERS CATERPILLARS SNAKES MICE THUNDER STORMS SHARP POINTS BLOOD ENCLOSED SPACES CROWDS SOLITUDE PASSING OVER A BRIDGE
8799-270794-0053 TRAVEL ON LAND AND SEA ET CETERA A FIRST ATTEMPT AT ORIENTATION IN THIS CHAOS LEADS READILY TO A DIVISION INTO THREE GROUPS SOME OF THE FEARFUL OBJECTS AND SITUATIONS HAVE SOMETHING GRUESOME FOR NORMAL PEOPLE TOO
8799-270794-0054 A RELATION TO DANGER AND SO THOUGH THEY ARE EXAGGERATED IN INTENSITY THEY DO NOT SEEM INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US MOST OF US FOR INSTANCE EXPERIENCE A FEELING OF REPULSION IN THE PRESENCE OF A SNAKE
8799-270794-0055 ONE MAY SAY THAT SNAKEPHOBIA IS COMMON TO ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND CHARLES DARWIN HAS DESCRIBED MOST IMPRESSIVELY HOW HE WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL HIS FEAR OF A SNAKE POINTING FOR HIM THOUGH HE KNEW HE WAS SEPARATED FROM IT BY A THICK PANE OF GLASS
8799-270794-0056 BUT THIS IS OF A KIND WHICH WE ARE DISPOSED TO BELITTLE RATHER THAN TO OVERESTIMATE MOST OF THE SITUATION PHOBIA BELONG HERE WE KNOW THAT BY TAKING A RAILROAD JOURNEY WE ENTAIL GREATER CHANCE OF DISASTER THAN BY STAYING AT HOME
8799-270794-0057 A COLLISION FOR INSTANCE MAY OCCUR OR A SHIP SINK WHEN AS A RULE WE MUST DROWN YET WE DO NOT THINK OF THESE DANGERS AND FREE FROM FEAR WE TRAVEL ON TRAIN AND BOAT WE CANNOT DENY THAT IF A BRIDGE SHOULD COLLAPSE AT THE MOMENT WE ARE CROSSING IT
8799-270794-0058 WE WOULD FALL INTO THE RIVER BUT THAT IS SUCH A RARE OCCURRENCE THAT WE DO NOT TAKE THE DANGER INTO ACCOUNT SOLITUDE TOO HAS ITS DANGERS AND WE AVOID IT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS A MATTER OF BEING UNABLE TO SUFFER IT FOR A SINGLE MOMENT
8799-270794-0059 THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THE CROWD THE ENCLOSED SPACE THE THUNDER STORM ET CETERA IT IS NOT AT ALL THE CONTENT BUT THE INTENSITY OF THESE NEUROTIC PHOBIAS THAT APPEARS STRANGE TO US
8799-270794-0060 THE FEAR OF THE PHOBIA CANNOT EVEN BE DESCRIBED SOMETIMES WE ALMOST RECEIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE NEUROTIC IS NOT REALLY AFRAID OF THE SAME THINGS AND SITUATIONS THAT CAN AROUSE FEAR IN US AND WHICH HE CALLS BY THE SAME NAME
8799-270794-0061 THERE REMAINS A THIRD GROUP OF PHOBIAS WHICH IS ENTIRELY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO US WHEN A STRONG ADULT MAN IS AFRAID TO CROSS A STREET OR A SQUARE OF HIS OWN HOME TOWN
8799-270794-0062 WHEN A HEALTHY WELL DEVELOPED WOMAN BECOMES ALMOST SENSELESS WITH FEAR BECAUSE A CAT HAS BRUSHED THE HEM OF HER DRESS OR A MOUSE HAS SCURRIED THROUGH THE ROOM HOW ARE WE TO ESTABLISH THE RELATION TO DANGER THAT OBVIOUSLY EXISTS UNDER THE PHOBIA
8799-270794-0063 IN THESE ANIMAL PHOBIAS IT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE A QUESTION OF THE HEIGHTENING OF COMMON HUMAN ANTIPATHIES FOR AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE ANTITHESIS THERE ARE NUMEROUS PERSONS WHO CANNOT PASS A CAT
8799-270794-0064 WITHOUT CALLING AND PETTING IT THE MOUSE OF WHICH WOMEN ARE SO MUCH AFRAID IS AT THE SAME TIME A FIRST CLASS PET NAME MANY A GIRL WHO HAS BEEN GRATIFIED TO HAVE HER LOVER CALL HER SO SCREAMS WHEN SHE SEES THE CUNNING LITTLE CREATURE ITSELF
8799-270794-0065 THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MAN WHO IS AFRAID TO CROSS THE STREET OR THE SQUARE CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY SAYING THAT HE ACTS LIKE A LITTLE CHILD A CHILD IS REALLY TAUGHT TO AVOID A SITUATION OF THIS SORT AS DANGEROUS
8799-270794-0066 AND OUR AGORAPHOBIST IS ACTUALLY RELIEVED OF HIS FEAR IF SOME ONE GOES WITH HIM ACROSS THE SQUARE OR STREET THE TWO FORMS OF FEAR THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED FREE FLOATING FEAR AND THE FEAR WHICH IS BOUND UP WITH PHOBIAS
8799-270794-0067 ARE INDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER THE ONE IS BY NO MEANS A HIGHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE OTHER ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES ALMOST BY ACCIDENT DO THEY OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY
8799-270794-0068 THE STRONGEST CONDITION OF GENERAL ANXIETY NEED NOT MANIFEST ITSELF IN PHOBIAS AND PERSONS WHOSE ENTIRE LIFE IS HEMMED IN BY AGORAPHOBIA CAN BE ENTIRELY FREE OF PESSIMISTIC EXPECTANT FEAR
8799-270794-0069 SOME PHOBIAS SUCH AS THE FEAR OF SQUARES OR OF TRAINS ARE ACQUIRED ONLY IN LATER LIFE WHILE OTHERS THE FEAR OF DARKNESS STORMS AND ANIMALS EXIST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
8799-270794-0070 THE FORMER SIGNIFY SERIOUS ILLNESS THE LATTER APPEAR RATHER AS PECULIARITIES MOODS YET WHOEVER IS BURDENED WITH FEAR OF THIS SECOND KIND MAY BE EXPECTED TO HARBOR OTHER AND SIMILAR PHOBIAS
8799-270794-0071 I MUST ADD THAT WE GROUP ALL THESE PHOBIAS UNDER ANXIETY HYSTERIA AND THEREFORE REGARD IT AS A CONDITION CLOSELY RELATED TO THE WELL KNOWN CONVERSION HYSTERIA
8799-270794-0072 THE THIRD FORM OF NEUROTIC FEAR CONFRONTS US WITH AN ENIGMA WE LOOSE SIGHT ENTIRELY OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN FEAR AND THREATENING DANGER THIS ANXIETY OCCURS IN HYSTERIA FOR INSTANCE
8799-270794-0073 AS THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF HYSTERIC SYMPTOMS OR UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF EXCITEMENT WHERE WE WOULD EXPECT AN EMOTIONAL MANIFESTATION BUT LEAST OF ALL OF FEAR OR WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ANY KNOWN CIRCUMSTANCE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO US AND TO THE PATIENT
8799-270794-0074 NEITHER FAR NOR NEAR CAN WE DISCOVER A DANGER OR A CAUSE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED TO SUCH SIGNIFICANCE THROUGH THESE SPONTANEOUS ATTACKS WE LEARN THAT THE COMPLEX WHICH WE CALL THE CONDITION OF ANXIETY
8799-270794-0075 CAN BE RESOLVED INTO ITS COMPONENTS THE WHOLE ATTACK MAY BE REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE INTENSIVELY DEVELOPED SYMPTOM SUCH AS A TREMBLING DIZZINESS PALPITATION OF THE HEART OR TIGHTENING OF BREATH
8799-270794-0076 THE GENERAL UNDERTONE BY WHICH WE USUALLY RECOGNIZE FEAR MAY BE UTTERLY LACKING OR VAGUE AND YET THESE CONDITIONS WHICH WE DESCRIBE AS ANXIETY EQUIVALENTS ARE COMPARABLE TO ANXIETY
8799-270794-0077 IN ALL ITS CLINICAL AND ETIOLOGICAL RELATIONS TWO QUESTIONS ARISE CAN WE RELATE NEUROTIC FEAR IN WHICH DANGER PLAYS SO SMALL A PART OR NONE AT ALL TO REAL FEAR
8799-270794-0078 WHICH IS ALWAYS A REACTION TO DANGER AND WHAT CAN WE UNDERSTAND AS THE BASIS OF NEUROTIC FEAR FOR THE PRESENT WE WANT TO HOLD TO OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEREVER THERE IS FEAR THERE MUST BE A CAUSE FOR IT
8799-270794-0079 CLINICAL OBSERVATION YIELDS SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE COMPREHENSION OF NEUROTIC FEAR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH I SHALL DISCUSS WITH YOU ONE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THAT EXPECTANT FEAR OR GENERAL ANXIETY
8799-270794-0080 IS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH CERTAIN PROCESSES IN SEXUAL LIFE LET US SAY WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF LIBIDO UTILIZATION THE SIMPLEST AND MOST INSTRUCTIVE CASE OF THIS KIND RESULTS WHEN PERSONS EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO FRUSTRATED EXCITATION
8799-270794-0081 IF THEIR SEXUAL EXCITATION DOES NOT MEET WITH SUFFICIENT RELIEF AND IS NOT BROUGHT TO A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION IN MEN DURING THE TIME OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT TO MARRY FOR INSTANCE OR IN WOMEN WHOSE HUSBANDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY POTENT OR WHO FROM CAUTION
8799-270794-0082 EXECUTE THE SEXUAL ACT IN A SHORTENED OR MUTILATED FORM UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES LIBIDINOUS EXCITEMENT DISAPPEARS AND ANXIETY TAKES ITS PLACE BOTH IN THE FORM OF EXPECTANT FEAR AND
8799-270794-0083 IN ATTACKS AND ANXIETY EQUIVALENTS THE CAUTIOUS INTERRUPTION OF THE SEXUAL ACT WHEN PRACTICED AS THE CUSTOMARY SEXUAL REGIME SO FREQUENTLY CAUSES THE ANXIETY NEUROSIS IN MEN AND ESPECIALLY IN WOMEN
8799-270794-0084 THAT PHYSICIANS ARE WISE IN SUCH CASES TO EXAMINE PRIMARILY THIS ETIOLOGY ON INNUMERABLE OCCASIONS WE HAVE LEARNED THAT ANXIETY NEUROSIS VANISHES WHEN THE SEXUAL MISUSE IS ABANDONED
8799-270794-0085 SO FAR AS I KNOW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SEXUAL RESTRAINT AND CONDITIONS OF ANXIETY IS NO LONGER QUESTIONED EVEN BY PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PSYCHOANALYSIS BUT I CAN WELL IMAGINE THAT THEY DO NOT DESIST FROM REVERSING THE CONNECTION
8799-270794-0086 AND SAYING THAT THESE PERSONS HAVE EXHIBITED A TENDENCY TO ANXIETY FROM THE OUTSET AND THEREFORE PRACTICE RESERVE IN SEXUAL MATTERS THE BEHAVIOR OF WOMEN WHOSE SEXUAL CONDUCT IS PASSIVE
8799-270794-0087 CONTRADICTS THIS SUPPOSITION THE MORE TEMPERAMENTAL THAT IS THE MORE DISPOSED TOWARD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AND CAPABLE OF GRATIFICATION IS THE WOMAN
8799-270794-0088 OR TO THE COITUS INTERRUPTUS BY ANXIETY MANIFESTATIONS IN ANAESTHETIC OR ONLY SLIGHTLY LIBIDINOUS WOMEN SUCH MISUSE WILL NOT CARRY SUCH CONSEQUENCES
8799-270794-0089 SEXUAL ABSTINENCE RECOMMENDED SO WARMLY BY THE PHYSICIANS OF TO DAY HAS THE SAME SIGNIFICANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONDITIONS OF ANXIETY ONLY WHEN THE LIBIDO TO WHICH SATISFACTORY RELIEF IS DENIED
8799-270794-0090 IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG AND NOT FOR THE MOST PART ACCOUNTED FOR BY SUBLIMATION THE DECISION WHETHER ILLNESS IS TO RESULT ALWAYS DEPENDS UPON THE QUANTITATIVE FACTORS
8799-270794-0091 EVEN WHERE CHARACTER FORMATION AND NOT DISEASE IS CONCERNED WE EASILY RECOGNIZE THAT SEXUAL CONSTRAINT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH A CERTAIN ANXIETY A CERTAIN CAUTION
8799-270794-0092 WHILE FEARLESSNESS AND BOLD DARING ARISE FROM FREE GRATIFICATION OF SEXUAL DESIRES HOWEVER MUCH THESE RELATIONS ARE ALTERED BY VARIOUS INFLUENCES OF CIVILIZATION FOR THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING IT IS TRUE
8799-270794-0093 THAT ANXIETY AND SEXUAL CONSTRAINT BELONG TOGETHER I HAVE BY NO MEANS MENTIONED ALL THE OBSERVATIONS THAT SPEAK FOR THE GENETIC RELATION OF THE LIBIDO TO FEAR
8799-270794-0094 THE INFLUENCE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEUROTIC FEAR OF CERTAIN PHASES OF LIFE SUCH AS PUBERTY AND THE PERIOD OF MENOPAUSE WHEN THE PRODUCTION OF LIBIDO IS MATERIALLY HEIGHTENED BELONGS HERE TOO IN SOME CONDITIONS OF EXCITEMENT WE MAY OBSERVE THE MIXTURE OF ANXIETY AND LIBIDO
