112-121671-0000 THE WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE
112-121671-0001 THE WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE SHE HAD SO MANY CHILDREN
112-121671-0002 SHE GAVE THEM SOME BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD AND WHIPPED THEM ALL SOUNDLY AND SENT THEM TO BED
112-121671-0003 AND HAS MARRIED THEM ALL HAPPILY SHE IS SURELY ENTITLED TO PASS HER REMAINING DAYS IN PEACE AND COMFORT SHE LIVED IN A PECULIAR LITTLE HOUSE THAT LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE THIS PICTURE
112-121671-0004 WITH WHITE GRAVEL PATHS AND MANY BEDS OF BRIGHT COLORED FLOWERS THE OLD WOMAN WAS VERY HAPPY AND CONTENTED THERE UNTIL ONE DAY SHE RECEIVED A LETTER SAYING THAT HER DAUGHTER HANNAH WAS DEAD AND HAD SENT HER FAMILY OF FIVE CHILDREN TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF
112-121671-0005 THIS MISFORTUNE RUINED ALL THE OLD WOMAN'S DREAMS OF QUIET BUT THE NEXT DAY THE CHILDREN ARRIVED THREE BOYS AND TWO GIRLS AND SHE MADE THE BEST OF IT AND GAVE THEM THE BEDS HER OWN DAUGHTERS HAD ONCE OCCUPIED AND HER OWN COT AS WELL
112-121671-0006 THE YOUNGSTERS WERE LIKE ALL OTHER CHILDREN AND GOT INTO MISCHIEF ONCE IN AWHILE BUT THE OLD WOMAN HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH CHILDREN AND MANAGED TO KEEP THEM IN ORDER VERY WELL WHILE THEY QUICKLY LEARNED TO OBEY HER AND GENERALLY DID AS THEY WERE BID
112-121671-0007 BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THEM SETTLED IN THEIR NEW HOME WHEN MARGARET ANOTHER OF HER DAUGHTERS DIED AND SENT FOUR MORE CHILDREN TO HER MOTHER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF THE OLD WOMAN SCARCELY KNEW WHERE TO KEEP THIS NEW FLOCK THAT HAD COME TO HER FOLD
112-121671-0008 OF COURSE IT WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE NINE SMALL CHILDREN THAN FIVE AND THEY OFTEN LED EACH OTHER INTO MISCHIEF SO THAT THE FLOWER BEDS BEGAN TO BE TRAMPLED UPON AND THE GREEN GRASS TO BE WORN UNDER THE CONSTANT TREAD OF LITTLE FEET
112-121671-0009 AND THE FURNITURE TO SHOW A GOOD MANY SCRATCHES AND BRUISES BUT THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED TO LOOK AFTER THEM AS WELL AS SHE WAS ABLE UNTIL SARAH HER THIRD DAUGHTER ALSO DIED AND THREE MORE CHILDREN WERE SENT TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER TO BE BROUGHT UP
112-121671-0010 THE OLD WOMAN WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED WHEN SHE HEARD OF THIS NEW ADDITION TO HER FAMILY BUT SHE DID NOT GIVE WAY TO DESPAIR SHE SENT FOR THE CARPENTER AGAIN AND HAD HIM BUILD ANOTHER ADDITION TO HER HOUSE AS THE PICTURE SHOWS
112-121671-0011 THEN SHE PUT THREE NEW COTS IN THE NEW PART FOR THE BABIES TO SLEEP IN AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY WERE JUST AS COZY AND COMFORTABLE AS PEAS IN A POD THE GRANDMOTHER WAS A LIVELY OLD WOMAN FOR ONE OF HER YEARS
112-121671-0012 YOU WILL REALIZE WHAT A LARGE FAMILY THE OLD WOMAN HAD AND HOW FULLY HER TIME WAS OCCUPIED IN CARING FOR THEM ALL AND NOW TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE HER FOURTH DAUGHTER WHO HAD BEEN NAMED ABIGAIL SUDDENLY TOOK SICK AND DIED AND SHE
112-121671-0013 ALSO HAD FOUR SMALL CHILDREN THAT MUST BE CARED FOR IN SOME WAY THE OLD WOMAN HAVING TAKEN THE OTHER TWELVE COULD NOT WELL REFUSE TO ADOPT THESE LITTLE ORPHANS ALSO I MAY AS WELL HAVE SIXTEEN AS A DOZEN SHE SAID WITH A SIGH
112-121671-0014 THEY WILL DRIVE ME CRAZY SOME DAY ANYHOW SO A FEW MORE WILL NOT MATTER AT ALL ONCE MORE SHE SENT FOR THE CARPENTER AND BADE HIM BUILD A THIRD ADDITION TO THE HOUSE AND WHEN IT WAS COMPLETED SHE ADDED FOUR MORE COTS TO THE DOZEN THAT WERE ALREADY IN USE
112-121671-0015 THE HOUSE PRESENTED A VERY QUEER APPEARANCE NOW BUT SHE DID NOT MIND THAT SO LONG AS THE BABIES WERE COMFORTABLE I SHALL NOT HAVE TO BUILD AGAIN SHE SAID AND THAT IS ONE SATISFACTION I HAVE NOW NO MORE DAUGHTERS TO DIE AND LEAVE ME THEIR CHILDREN
112-121671-0016 AND THE FLOWER BEDS TRAMPLED INTO SHAPELESS MASSES BY THIRTY TWO LITTLE FEET THAT RAN ABOUT FROM MORN TILL NIGHT BUT THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT COMPLAIN AT THIS
112-121671-0017 IT COST SO MUCH MONEY TO CLOTHE THEM
112-121671-0018 BUT IT WAS A GOOD AND WHOLESOME DIET AND THE CHILDREN THRIVED AND GREW FAT UPON IT ONE DAY A STRANGER CAME ALONG THE ROAD AND WHEN HE SAW THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE HE BEGAN TO LAUGH WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SIR
112-121671-0019 ASKED THE GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS SITTING UPON HER DOORSTEPS ENGAGED IN MENDING SIXTEEN PAIRS OF STOCKINGS AT YOUR HOUSE THE STRANGER REPLIED IT LOOKS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A BIG SHOE A SHOE SHE SAID IN SURPRISE WHY YES
112-121671-0020 AND SOON PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT THE QUEER HOUSE AND THEY USUALLY WENT AWAY LAUGHING THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT MIND THIS AT ALL SHE WAS TOO BUSY TO BE ANGRY
112-121671-0021 OR FALLING DOWN AND HURTING THEMSELVES AND THESE HAD TO BE COMFORTED AND SOME WERE NAUGHTY AND HAD TO BE WHIPPED AND SOME WERE DIRTY AND HAD TO BE WASHED AND SOME WERE GOOD AND HAD TO BE KISSED IT WAS GRAN'MA DO THIS AND GRAN'MA DO THAT FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
112-121671-0022 SO THAT THE POOR GRANDMOTHER WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED THE ONLY PEACE SHE EVER GOT WAS WHEN THEY WERE ALL SAFELY TUCKED IN THEIR LITTLE COTS AND WERE SOUND ASLEEP FOR THEN AT LEAST SHE WAS FREE FROM WORRY AND HAD A CHANCE TO GATHER HER SCATTERED WITS
112-121671-0023 THERE ARE SO MANY CHILDREN SHE SAID ONE DAY TO THE BAKER MAN THAT I OFTEN REALLY DO N'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
112-121671-0024 SOME OF THE CHILDREN HEARD HIM SAY THIS AND THEY RESOLVED TO PLAY HIM A TRICK IN RETURN FOR HIS ILL NATURED SPEECH THE BAKER MAN CAME EVERY DAY TO THE SHOE HOUSE AND BROUGHT TWO GREAT BASKETS OF BREAD
112-121671-0025 THE CHILDREN ALL PAINTED THEIR FACES TO LOOK AS INDIANS DO WHEN THEY ARE ON THE WARPATH AND THEY CAUGHT THE ROOSTERS AND THE TURKEY COCK AND PULLED FEATHERS FROM THEIR TAILS TO STICK IN THEIR HAIR AND THEN THE BOYS MADE WOODEN TOMAHAWKS FOR THE GIRLS AND BOWS AND ARROWS FOR THEIR OWN USE
112-121671-0026 AND THEN ALL SIXTEEN WENT OUT AND HID IN THE BUSHES NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL BY AND BY THE BAKER MAN CAME SLOWLY UP THE PATH WITH A BASKET OF BREAD ON EITHER ARM AND JUST AS HE REACHED THE BUSHES THERE SOUNDED IN HIS EARS A MOST UNEARTHLY WAR WHOOP
112-121671-0027 THEN A FLIGHT OF ARROWS CAME FROM THE BUSHES AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BLUNT AND COULD DO HIM NO HARM THEY RATTLED ALL OVER HIS BODY AND ONE HIT HIS NOSE AND ANOTHER HIS CHIN WHILE SEVERAL STUCK FAST IN THE LOAVES OF BREAD ALTOGETHER THE BAKER MAN WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
112-121671-0028 AND WHEN ALL THE SIXTEEN SMALL INDIANS RUSHED FROM THE BUSHES AND FLOURISHED THEIR TOMAHAWKS HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND RAN DOWN THE HILL AS FAST AS HE COULD GO WHEN THE GRANDMOTHER RETURNED SHE ASKED WHERE IS THE BREAD FOR YOUR SUPPER
112-121671-0029 THE CHILDREN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE BREAD AND THEN ONE OF THEM CONFESSED AND TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY OF HOW THEY HAD FRIGHTENED THE BAKER MAN FOR SAYING HE WOULD SEND THEM TO THE POOR HOUSE
112-121671-0030 YOU ARE SIXTEEN VERY NAUGHTY CHILDREN EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN AND FOR PUNISHMENT YOU MUST EAT YOUR BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD AND AFTERWARDS EACH ONE SHALL HAVE A SOUND WHIPPING AND BE SENT TO BED THEN ALL THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO CRY AT ONCE
112-121671-0031 AND THERE WAS SUCH AN UPROAR THAT THEIR GRANDMOTHER HAD TO PUT COTTON IN HER EARS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE HER HEARING BUT SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND MADE THEM EAT THEIR BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO BREAD TO GIVE THEM THEN SHE STOOD THEM IN A ROW AND UNDRESSED THEM
112-121671-0032 AND AS SHE PUT THE NIGHTDRESS ON EACH ONE SHE GAVE IT A SOUND WHIPPING AND SENT IT TO BED THEY CRIED SOME OF COURSE BUT THEY KNEW VERY WELL THEY DESERVED THE PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE ALL OF THEM WERE SOUND ASLEEP
112-121671-0033 THEY TOOK CARE NOT TO PLAY ANY MORE TRICKS ON THE BAKER MAN AND AS THEY GREW OLDER THEY WERE NATURALLY MUCH BETTER BEHAVED BEFORE MANY YEARS THE BOYS WERE OLD ENOUGH TO WORK FOR THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND THAT MADE THE WOMAN'S FAMILY A GOOD DEAL SMALLER
