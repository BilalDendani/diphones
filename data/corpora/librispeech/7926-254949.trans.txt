7926-254949-0000 ONE YEAR AFTER THE RETURN OF THE COMPANIONS OF BARENTZ
7926-254949-0001 WITH TWO YACHTS THE EENDRACHT AND ESPERANCE
7926-254949-0002 QUITTED AMSTERDAM ON THE SECOND JULY FIFTEEN NINETY EIGHT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THIS SQUADRON WAS OLIVER DE NOORT A MAN AT THAT TIME ABOUT THIRTY OR THEREABOUTS AND WELL KNOWN AS HAVING MADE SEVERAL LONG CRUISING VOYAGES
7926-254949-0003 HIS SECOND IN COMMAND AND VICE ADMIRAL WAS JACOB CLAAZ D'ULPENDA AND AS PILOT THERE WAS A CERTAIN MELIS A SKILFUL SAILOR OF ENGLISH ORIGIN
7926-254949-0004 THIS EXPEDITION FITTED OUT BY THE MERCHANTS OF AMSTERDAM WITH THE CONCURRENCE AND AID OF THE STATES GENERAL OF HOLLAND HAD A DOUBLE PURPOSE AT ONCE COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY
7926-254949-0005 FORMERLY THE DUTCH HAD CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH FETCHING FROM PORTUGAL THE MERCHANDISE WHICH THEY DISTRIBUTED BY MEANS OF THEIR COASTING VESSELS THROUGHOUT EUROPE BUT NOW THEY WERE REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF GOING TO SEEK THE COMMODITIES IN THE SCENE OF THEIR PRODUCTION
7926-254949-0006 FOR THIS OBJECT DE NOORT WAS TO SHOW HIS COUNTRYMEN THE ROUTE INAUGURATED BY MAGELLAN AND ON THE WAY TO INFLICT AS MUCH INJURY AS HE COULD UPON THE SPANIARDS AND PORTUGUESE
7926-254949-0007 AND WHO HAD JUST ADDED PORTUGAL TO HIS POSSESSIONS HAD FORBIDDEN HIS SUBJECTS TO HAVE ANY COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE WITH THE REBELS OF THE LOW COUNTRIES IT WAS THUS A NECESSITY FOR HOLLAND IF SHE DID NOT WISH TO BE RUINED
7926-254949-0008 AND AS A CONSEQUENCE TO FALL ANEW UNDER SPANISH RULE TO OPEN UP FOR HERSELF A ROAD TO THE SPICE ISLANDS THE ROUTE WHICH WAS THE LEAST FREQUENTED BY THE ENEMY'S SHIPS WAS THAT BY THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN AND THIS WAS THE ONE WHICH DE NOORT WAS ORDERED TO FOLLOW
7926-254949-0009 AFTER TOUCHING AT GOREE THE DUTCH ANCHORED IN THE GULF OF GUINEA
7926-254949-0010 HERE THE PORTUGUESE PRETENDED TO GIVE A FRIENDLY WELCOME TO THE MEN WHO WENT ON SHORE BUT THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY TO FALL UPON AND MASSACRE THEM WITHOUT MERCY AMONG THE DEAD WERE CORNILLE DE NOORT BROTHER OF THE ADMIRAL MELIS
7926-254949-0011 AND JOHN DE BREMEN THE CAPTAIN PETER ESIAS BEING THE ONLY MAN WHO ESCAPED IT WAS A SORROWFUL COMMENCEMENT FOR A CAMPAIGN A SAD PRESAGE WHICH WAS DESTINED NOT TO REMAIN UNFULFILLED DE NOORT WHO WAS FURIOUS OVER THIS FOUL PLAY
7926-254949-0012 BUT HE FOUND THE PORTUGUESE SO WELL ENTRENCHED THAT AFTER A BRISK SKIRMISH IN WHICH SEVENTEEN MORE OF HIS MEN WERE EITHER KILLED OR WOUNDED HE WAS OBLIGED TO WEIGH ANCHOR WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO AVENGE THE WICKED AND COWARDLY PERFIDY TO WHICH HIS BROTHER
7926-254949-0013 FOR ENDEAVOURING TO FOMENT A SPIRIT OF DESPONDENCY AMONGST THE CREWS AND FOR HIS WELL PROVED REBELLION
7926-254949-0014 AND THE COURSE OF THE SHIPS WAS CHANGED FOR CROSSING THE ATLANTIC DE NOORT HAD SCARCELY CAST ANCHOR IN THE BAY OF RIO JANEIRO BEFORE HE SENT SOME SAILORS ON SHORE TO OBTAIN WATER AND BUY PROVISIONS FROM THE NATIVES
7926-254949-0015 THE DUTCHMEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR PILOT TOSS AT RANDOM UPON THE OCEAN
7926-254949-0016 THE FLAG SHIP STRUCK UPON A ROCK WITH SO MUCH VIOLENCE THAT HAD THE SEA BEEN A LITTLE ROUGHER SHE MUST HAVE BEEN LOST THERE WERE ALSO SOME BLOODY AND BARBAROUS EXECUTIONS OF MUTINOUS SAILORS NOTABLY THAT OF A POOR MAN
7926-254949-0017 WHO HAVING WOUNDED A PILOT WITH A KNIFE THRUST WAS CONDEMNED TO HAVE HIS HAND NAILED TO THE MAINMAST THE INVALIDS OF WHOM THERE WERE MANY ON BOARD THE FLEET WERE BROUGHT ON SHORE AND NEARLY ALL WERE CURED BY THE END OF A FORTNIGHT
7926-254949-0018 WHICH WAS NOT MORE THAN THREE MILES FROM THE MAINLAND BUT BEFORE PUTTING TO SEA HE WAS OBLIGED TO BURN THE EENDRACHT
7926-254949-0019 THAT HE WAS ABLE TO CAST ANCHOR IN PORT DESIRE WHERE THE CREW KILLED IN A FEW DAYS A QUANTITY OF DOG FISH AND SEA LIONS
7926-254949-0020 AND WAS INTERRED AT PORT DESIRE ON THE TWENTY THIRD NOVEMBER THE FLEET ENTERED THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN
7926-254949-0021 WITH TWO DUTCH SHIPS UNDER THE COMMAND OF SEBALD DE WEERDT WHO HAD WINTERED NOT FAR FROM THE BAY OF MAURITIUS AND BY THE ABANDONING OF VICE ADMIRAL CLAAZ WHO AS IT WOULD APPEAR HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES GUILTY OF INSUBORDINATION
7926-254949-0022 ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF FEBRUARY SIXTEEN HUNDRED DE NOORT AFTER HAVING BEEN NINETY NINE DAYS IN PASSING THROUGH THE STRAIT CAME OUT ON TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN A FORTNIGHT LATER A STORM SEPARATED HIM FROM THE HENDRIK FREDRIK
7926-254949-0023 AFTERWARDS HE SAILED ALONG THE COAST OF CHILI WHERE HE WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN PROVISIONS IN ABUNDANCE IN EXCHANGE FOR NUREMBERG KNIVES HATCHETS SHIRTS HATS AND OTHER ARTICLES OF NO GREAT VALUE
7926-254949-0024 AFTER RAVAGING PLUNDERING AND BURNING SEVERAL TOWNS ON THE PERUVIAN COAST AFTER SINKING ALL THE VESSELS THAT HE MET WITH AND AMASSING A CONSIDERABLE BOOTY
7926-254949-0025 DE NOORT HEARING THAT A SQUADRON COMMANDED BY THE BROTHER OF THE VICEROY DON LUIS DE VELASCO HAD BEEN SENT IN PURSUIT OF HIM JUDGED IT TIME TO MAKE FOR THE LADRONE ISLANDS
7926-254949-0026 THEY ARE AS MUCH AT HOME IN THE WATER AS UPON LAND AND ARE VERY CLEVER DIVERS AS WE PERCEIVED WHEN WE THREW FIVE PIECES OF IRON INTO THE SEA
7926-254949-0027 ONE OF THEM HAVING SUCCEEDED IN CLIMBING ALONG A PART OF THE RIGGING HAD THE AUDACITY TO ENTER A CABIN AND SEIZE UPON A SWORD WITH WHICH HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THE SEA
7926-254949-0028 ON THE FOURTEENTH OCTOBER FOLLOWING DE NOORT TRAVERSED THE PHILIPPINE ARCHIPELAGO WHERE HE MADE SEVERAL DESCENTS AND BURNT PLUNDERED OR SUNK A NUMBER OF SPANISH OR PORTUGUESE VESSELS AND SOME CHINESE JUNKS
7926-254949-0029 AND IN THE BATTLE WHICH FOLLOWED THE DUTCH HAD FIVE MEN KILLED AND TWENTY FIVE WOUNDED AND LOST THEIR BRIGANTINE WHICH WAS CAPTURED WITH HER CREW OF TWENTY FIVE MEN THE SPANIARDS LOST MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEN FOR THEIR FLAG SHIP CAUGHT FIRE AND SANK
7926-254949-0030 FAR FROM PICKING UP THE WOUNDED AND THE ABLE BODIED MEN WHO WERE TRYING TO SAVE THEMSELVES BY SWIMMING THE DUTCH MAKING WAY WITH SAILS SET ON THE FOREMAST ACROSS THE HEADS WHICH WERE TO BE SEEN IN THE WATER PIERCED SOME WITH LANCES
7926-254949-0031 AND ALSO DISCHARGED THEIR CANNON OVER THEM AFTER THIS BLOODY AND FRUITLESS VICTORY DE NOORT WENT TO RECRUIT AT BORNEO CAPTURED A RICH CARGO OF SPICES AT JAVA AND HAVING DOUBLED THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE LANDED AT ROTTERDAM ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF AUGUST
7926-254949-0032 AND WHO HAD TAUGHT HIS COUNTRYMEN THE WAY TO THE INDIES IT BEHOVES US WHILE EXTOLLING HIS QUALITIES AS A SAILOR
7926-254949-0033 IN THE MIDST OF ALL THOSE GASCONS WHO FORMED THE BASIS OF THE ARMIES OF HENRY OF NAVARRE AND IN SUCH SOCIETY HE PERFECTED THE HABITS OF BOASTING AND FALSEHOOD WHICH BELONGED TO HIS CHARACTER
7926-254949-0034 AND THE NUMBER OF AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS WAS GREATLY REDUCED BY THE CHANGE FROM THENCE AROSE GENERAL DISTRESS AND ALSO SUCH A SURPLUSSAGE OF POPULATION AS WAS FAST BECOMING A MATTER OF ANXIOUS CONCERN
7926-254949-0035 AT THIS MOMENT THEREFORE ARISES THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EMIGRATION AS MAY RELIEVE THE COUNTRY OF ITS POPULATION MAY PERMIT ALL THE MISERABLE PEOPLE DYING OF HUNGER TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN WANTS IN A NEW COUNTRY
7926-254949-0036 AND BY THAT MEANS MAY INCREASE THE INFLUENCE AND PROSPERITY OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY ALL THE MORE THOUGHTFUL MINDS IN ENGLAND WHO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF PUBLIC OPINION HAKLUYT THOMAS HARIOT CARLYLE PECKHAM AND THE BROTHERS GILBERT
7926-254949-0037 BUT HE NEITHER CONCEIVED NOR BEGAN THE CARRYING INTO EXECUTION AS HE HAS BEEN TOO OFTEN CREDITED WITH DOING OF THIS FRUITFUL PROJECT
7926-254949-0038 AFTERWARDS PROCEEDING TO SUPPORT THE CLAIMS OF THE PRIOR DE CRATO
7926-254949-0039 IT IS A SHORT TIME AFTER HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND THAT HE FALLS INTO DISGRACE WITH HIS ROYAL MISTRESS
7926-254949-0040 WOULD NOT THE DISCOVERY AND CONQUEST OF EL DORADO OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH ACCORDING TO ORELLANA THE TEMPLES ARE ROOFED WITH PLATES OF GOLD WHERE ALL THE TOOLS EVEN THOSE FOR THE MEANEST PURPOSES ARE MADE OF GOLD WHERE ONE WALKS UPON PRECIOUS STONES
7926-254949-0041 PROCURE FOR HIM GREATER GLORY THESE ARE THE VERY WORDS WHICH RALEIGH EMPLOYS IN HIS ACCOUNT THAN CORTES HAD GAINED IN MEXICO OR PIZARRO IN PERU HE WILL HAVE UNDER HIM MORE GOLDEN TOWNS AND NATIONS THAN THE KING OF SPAIN THE SULTAN OF THE TURKS
7926-254949-0042 HUMBOLDT DISCLOSES WHAT HAD GIVEN THEM BIRTH WHEN HE DESCRIBES TO US THE NATURE OF THE SOIL AND THE ROCKS WHICH SURROUND LAKE PARIMA
7926-254949-0043 THEY ARE SAYS THIS GREAT TRAVELLER ROCKS OF MICACEOUS SLATE AND OF SPARKLING TALC WHICH ARE RESPLENDENT IN THE MIDST OF A SHEET OF WATER WHICH ACTS AS A REFLECTOR BENEATH THE BURNING TROPICAL SUN
7926-254949-0044 AND ALL THOSE MARVELS OF WHICH THE BOASTFUL AND ENTHUSIASTIC MINDS OF THE SPANIARDS AFFORDED THEM A GLIMPSE
7926-254949-0045 OF ITS PRODUCTIONS AND ITS INHABITANTS WITH IMPERTURBABLE ASSURANCE BUT HE HAD TAKEN CARE TO SEND AT HIS OWN EXPENSE A SHIP COMMANDED BY CAPTAIN WHIDDON TO PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE FLEET WHICH HE INTENDED TO CONDUCT IN PERSON TO THE BANKS OF THE ORINOCO
7926-254949-0046 WAS THAT ALL THE INFORMATION HE RECEIVED FROM HIS EMISSARY WAS UNFAVOURABLE TO THE ENTERPRISE RALEIGH HIMSELF STARTED FROM PLYMOUTH ON THE NINTH FEBRUARY FIFTEEN NINETY FIVE WITH A SMALL FLEET OF FIVE VESSELS AND ONE HUNDRED SOLDIERS
7926-254949-0047 WITHOUT RECKONING MARINES OFFICERS AND VOLUNTEERS AFTER STOPPING FOUR DAYS AT FORTAVENTURA ONE OF THE CANARIES TO TAKE IN WOOD AND WATER THERE HE REACHED TENERIFFE WHERE CAPTAIN BRERETON OUGHT TO HAVE REJOINED HIM
7926-254949-0048 THE ARRIVAL OF THE ENGLISH DID NOT PLEASE HIM AND HE IMMEDIATELY DESPATCHED EMISSARIES TO CUMANA AND TO MARGARITA WITH ORDERS TO GATHER TOGETHER THE TROOPS TO ATTACK THE ENGLISHMEN
7926-254949-0049 THE ACCOUNT WHICH RALEIGH GIVES OF HIS CAMPAIGN IS SO FABULOUS WITH THE COOLNESS OF A GASCON TRANSPORTED TO THE BANKS OF THE THAMES
7926-254949-0050 HE SO HEAPS ONE FALSEHOOD UPON THE TOP OF ANOTHER THAT ONE IS ALMOST TEMPTED TO CLASS HIS NARRATIVE AMONGST THE NUMBER OF IMAGINARY VOYAGES HE SAYS THAT SOME SPANIARDS WHO HAD SEEN THE TOWN OF MANOA CALLED EL DORADO
7926-254949-0051 WITH GAME AND BIRDS OF EVERY SPECIES IN GREAT ABUNDANCE WHO FILLED THE AIR WITH HITHERTO UNKNOWN NOTES IT WAS A REAL CONCERT FOR US MY CAPTAIN SENT TO SEARCH FOR MINES PERCEIVED VEINS BOTH OF GOLD AND SILVER
7926-254949-0052 BUT AS HE HAD NO TOOL BUT HIS SWORD HE WAS UNABLE TO DETACH THESE METALS TO EXAMINE THEM IN DETAIL HOWEVER HE CARRIED AWAY SEVERAL BITS OF THEM WHICH HE RESERVED FOR FUTURE EXAMINATION
7926-254949-0053 BUT WHY SHOULD I HAVE UNDERTAKEN A VOYAGE THUS LABORIOUS IF I HAD NOT ENTERTAINED THE CONVICTION THAT THERE IS NOT A COUNTRY UPON EARTH WHICH IS RICHER IN GOLD THAN GUIANA
7926-254949-0054 I SHOWED THESE STONES TO SEVERAL INHABITANTS OF ORINOCO WHO HAVE ASSURED ME THAT THERE EXISTS AN ENTIRE MOUNTAIN OF THEM
7926-254949-0055 CAME TO SEE RALEIGH BOASTED TO HIM OF THE FORMIDABLE POWER OF THE EMPEROR OF MANOA AND PROVED TO HIM THAT HIS FORCES WERE INSUFFICIENT
7926-254949-0056 AS WEARING CLOTHES AND POSSESSING GREAT RICHES ESPECIALLY IN PLATES OF GOLD FINALLY HE SPOKE TO HIM OF A MOUNTAIN OF PURE GOLD RALEIGH RELATES THAT HE WISHED TO APPROACH THIS MOUNTAIN BUT SAD MISCHANCE IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT HALF SUBMERGED
7926-254949-0057 THEIR EXTRAORDINARY WHITENESS NEVERTHELESS SURPRISED ME AFTER A SHORT TIME OF REPOSE ON THE BANKS OF THE VINICAPARA AND A VISIT TO THE VILLAGE OF THE CACIQUE
7926-254949-0058 WE WILL SPARE THE READER THE DESCRIPTION OF PEOPLE THREE TIMES TALLER THAN ORDINARY MEN OF CYCLOPS OF NATIVES WHO HAD THEIR EYES UPON THE SHOULDERS THEIR MOUTH IN THE CHEST AND THE HAIR GROWING FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK
7926-254949-0059 IF WE PUT ON ONE SIDE ALL THESE FIGMENTS OF AN IMAGINATION RUN MAD WHAT GAIN HAS BEEN DERIVED FOR GEOGRAPHY THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO PAINS SPARED IN ANNOUNCING WITH MUCH NOISE AND VERY GREAT PUFFING THIS FANTASTIC EXPEDITION
7926-254949-0060 IN FANCY FREE I AN AUTHOR SEE WHO SAYS THE AWFUL WAR I'LL SING OF TITANS WITH THE THUNDER KING
