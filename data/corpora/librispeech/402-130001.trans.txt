402-130001-0000 ONE OTHER SHORT CALL IN HARLEY STREET IN WHICH ELINOR RECEIVED HER BROTHER'S CONGRATULATIONS ON THEIR TRAVELLING SO FAR TOWARDS BARTON WITHOUT ANY EXPENSE
402-130001-0001 COMPLETED THE INTERCOURSE OF THE BROTHER AND SISTERS IN TOWN AND A FAINT INVITATION FROM FANNY TO COME TO NORLAND WHENEVER IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE IN THEIR WAY WHICH OF ALL THINGS WAS THE MOST UNLIKELY TO OCCUR
402-130001-0002 WITH A MORE WARM THOUGH LESS PUBLIC ASSURANCE FROM JOHN TO ELINOR OF THE PROMPTITUDE WITH WHICH HE SHOULD COME TO SEE HER AT DELAFORD WAS ALL THAT FORETOLD ANY MEETING IN THE COUNTRY
402-130001-0003 IT AMUSED HER TO OBSERVE THAT ALL HER FRIENDS SEEMED DETERMINED TO SEND HER TO DELAFORD A PLACE IN WHICH OF ALL OTHERS SHE WOULD NOW LEAST CHUSE TO VISIT OR WISH TO RESIDE
402-130001-0004 FOR NOT ONLY WAS IT CONSIDERED AS HER FUTURE HOME BY HER BROTHER AND MISSUS JENNINGS BUT EVEN LUCY WHEN THEY PARTED GAVE HER A PRESSING INVITATION TO VISIT HER THERE VERY EARLY IN APRIL
402-130001-0005 AND TOLERABLY EARLY IN THE DAY THE TWO PARTIES FROM HANOVER SQUARE AND BERKELEY STREET SET OUT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES TO MEET BY APPOINTMENT ON THE ROAD FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF CHARLOTTE AND HER CHILD
402-130001-0006 THEY WERE TO BE MORE THAN TWO DAYS ON THEIR JOURNEY AND MISTER PALMER TRAVELLING MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY WITH COLONEL BRANDON WAS TO JOIN THEM AT CLEVELAND SOON AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL MARIANNE FEW AS HAD BEEN HER HOURS OF COMFORT IN LONDON
402-130001-0007 AND EAGER AS SHE HAD LONG BEEN TO QUIT IT COULD NOT WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT BID ADIEU TO THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHE HAD FOR THE LAST TIME ENJOYED THOSE HOPES AND THAT CONFIDENCE IN WILLOUGHBY WHICH WERE NOW EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER WITHOUT GREAT PAIN
402-130001-0008 NOR COULD SHE LEAVE THE PLACE IN WHICH WILLOUGHBY REMAINED BUSY IN NEW ENGAGEMENTS AND NEW SCHEMES IN WHICH SHE COULD HAVE NO SHARE
402-130001-0009 SHE WAS PLEASED TO BE FREE HERSELF FROM THE PERSECUTION OF LUCY'S FRIENDSHIP SHE WAS GRATEFUL FOR BRINGING HER SISTER AWAY UNSEEN BY WILLOUGHBY SINCE HIS MARRIAGE AND SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH HOPE TO WHAT A FEW MONTHS OF TRANQUILITY AT BARTON MIGHT DO TOWARDS RESTORING MARIANNE'S PEACE OF MIND
402-130001-0010 AND CONFIRMING HER OWN THEIR JOURNEY WAS SAFELY PERFORMED THE SECOND DAY BROUGHT THEM INTO THE CHERISHED OR THE PROHIBITED COUNTY OF SOMERSET FOR AS SUCH WAS IT DWELT ON BY TURNS IN MARIANNE'S IMAGINATION
402-130001-0011 AND LIKE EVERY OTHER PLACE OF THE SAME DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE IT HAD ITS OPEN SHRUBBERY AND CLOSER WOOD WALK A ROAD OF SMOOTH GRAVEL WINDING ROUND A PLANTATION LED TO THE FRONT THE LAWN WAS DOTTED OVER WITH TIMBER THE HOUSE ITSELF WAS UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE FIR
402-130001-0012 THE MOUNTAIN ASH AND THE ACACIA AND A THICK SCREEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER INTERSPERSED WITH TALL LOMBARDY POPLARS SHUT OUT THE OFFICES MARIANNE ENTERED THE HOUSE WITH A HEART SWELLING WITH EMOTION
402-130001-0013 FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING ONLY EIGHTY MILES FROM BARTON AND NOT THIRTY FROM COMBE MAGNA AND BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN FIVE MINUTES WITHIN ITS WALLS WHILE THE OTHERS WERE BUSILY HELPING CHARLOTTE TO SHOW HER CHILD TO THE HOUSEKEEPER SHE QUITTED IT AGAIN
402-130001-0014 STEALING AWAY THROUGH THE WINDING SHRUBBERIES NOW JUST BEGINNING TO BE IN BEAUTY TO GAIN A DISTANT EMINENCE WHERE FROM ITS GRECIAN TEMPLE HER EYE WANDERING OVER A WIDE TRACT OF COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH EAST
402-130001-0015 COULD FONDLY REST ON THE FARTHEST RIDGE OF HILLS IN THE HORIZON AND FANCY THAT FROM THEIR SUMMITS COMBE MAGNA MIGHT BE SEEN IN SUCH MOMENTS OF PRECIOUS INVALUABLE MISERY
402-130001-0016 SHE RETURNED JUST IN TIME TO JOIN THE OTHERS AS THEY QUITTED THE HOUSE ON AN EXCURSION THROUGH ITS MORE IMMEDIATE PREMISES AND THE REST OF THE MORNING WAS EASILY WHILED AWAY IN LOUNGING ROUND THE KITCHEN GARDEN EXAMINING THE BLOOM UPON ITS WALLS
402-130001-0017 AND LISTENING TO THE GARDENER'S LAMENTATIONS UPON BLIGHTS IN DAWDLING THROUGH THE GREEN HOUSE WHERE THE LOSS OF HER FAVOURITE PLANTS UNWARILY EXPOSED AND NIPPED BY THE LINGERING FROST
402-130001-0018 AND IN VISITING HER POULTRY YARD WHERE IN THE DISAPPOINTED HOPES OF HER DAIRY MAID BY HENS FORSAKING THEIR NESTS OR BEING STOLEN BY A FOX OR IN THE RAPID DECREASE OF A PROMISING YOUNG BROOD SHE FOUND FRESH SOURCES OF MERRIMENT
402-130001-0019 THE MORNING WAS FINE AND DRY AND MARIANNE IN HER PLAN OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD HAD NOT CALCULATED FOR ANY CHANGE OF WEATHER DURING THEIR STAY AT CLEVELAND WITH GREAT SURPRISE THEREFORE
402-130001-0020 AND WONDERED WHETHER MISTER PALMER AND COLONEL BRANDON WOULD GET FARTHER THAN READING THAT NIGHT ELINOR HOWEVER LITTLE CONCERNED IN IT JOINED IN THEIR DISCOURSE AND MARIANNE WHO HAD THE KNACK OF FINDING HER WAY IN EVERY HOUSE TO THE LIBRARY
402-130001-0021 HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE AVOIDED BY THE FAMILY IN GENERAL SOON PROCURED HERSELF A BOOK NOTHING WAS WANTING ON MISSUS PALMER'S SIDE THAT CONSTANT AND FRIENDLY GOOD HUMOUR COULD DO TO MAKE THEM FEEL THEMSELVES WELCOME
402-130001-0022 THE OPENNESS AND HEARTINESS OF HER MANNER MORE THAN ATONED FOR THAT WANT OF RECOLLECTION AND ELEGANCE WHICH MADE HER OFTEN DEFICIENT IN THE FORMS OF POLITENESS HER KINDNESS RECOMMENDED BY SO PRETTY A FACE WAS ENGAGING HER FOLLY
402-130001-0023 AFFORDING A PLEASANT ENLARGEMENT OF THE PARTY AND A VERY WELCOME VARIETY TO THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH A LONG MORNING OF THE SAME CONTINUED RAIN HAD REDUCED VERY LOW ELINOR HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF MISTER PALMER AND IN THAT LITTLE
402-130001-0024 HAD SEEN SO MUCH VARIETY IN HIS ADDRESS TO HER SISTER AND HERSELF THAT SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO EXPECT TO FIND HIM IN HIS OWN FAMILY SHE FOUND HIM HOWEVER PERFECTLY THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ALL HIS VISITORS
402-130001-0025 AND ONLY OCCASIONALLY RUDE TO HIS WIFE AND HER MOTHER SHE FOUND HIM VERY CAPABLE OF BEING A PLEASANT COMPANION AND ONLY PREVENTED FROM BEING SO ALWAYS BY TOO GREAT AN APTITUDE TO FANCY HIMSELF AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE IN GENERAL
402-130001-0026 AS HE MUST FEEL HIMSELF TO BE TO MISSUS JENNINGS AND CHARLOTTE FOR THE REST OF HIS CHARACTER AND HABITS THEY WERE MARKED AS FAR AS ELINOR COULD PERCEIVE WITH NO TRAITS AT ALL UNUSUAL IN HIS SEX AND TIME OF LIFE HE WAS NICE IN HIS EATING
402-130001-0027 SHE LIKED HIM HOWEVER UPON THE WHOLE MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND IN HER HEART WAS NOT SORRY THAT SHE COULD LIKE HIM NO MORE NOT SORRY TO BE DRIVEN BY THE OBSERVATION OF HIS EPICURISM HIS SELFISHNESS AND HIS CONCEIT
402-130001-0028 TO REST WITH COMPLACENCY ON THE REMEMBRANCE OF EDWARD'S GENEROUS TEMPER SIMPLE TASTE AND DIFFIDENT FEELINGS OF EDWARD OR AT LEAST OF SOME OF HIS CONCERNS SHE NOW RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE FROM COLONEL BRANDON
402-130001-0029 WHO HAD BEEN INTO DORSETSHIRE LATELY AND WHO TREATING HER AT ONCE AS THE DISINTERESTED FRIEND OF MISTER FERRARS AND THE KIND OF CONFIDANT OF HIMSELF TALKED TO HER A GREAT DEAL OF THE PARSONAGE AT DELAFORD DESCRIBED ITS DEFICIENCIES
402-130001-0030 AND TOLD HER WHAT HE MEANT TO DO HIMSELF TOWARDS REMOVING THEM HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER IN THIS AS WELL AS IN EVERY OTHER PARTICULAR HIS OPEN PLEASURE IN MEETING HER AFTER AN ABSENCE OF ONLY TEN DAYS HIS READINESS TO CONVERSE WITH HER
402-130001-0031 AND HIS DEFERENCE FOR HER OPINION MIGHT VERY WELL JUSTIFY MISSUS JENNINGS'S PERSUASION OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH PERHAPS HAD NOT ELINOR STILL AS FROM THE FIRST BELIEVED MARIANNE HIS REAL FAVOURITE TO MAKE HER SUSPECT IT HERSELF
402-130001-0032 BUT AS IT WAS SUCH A NOTION HAD SCARCELY EVER ENTERED HER HEAD EXCEPT BY MISSUS JENNINGS'S SUGGESTION AND SHE COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING HERSELF THE NICEST OBSERVER OF THE TWO SHE WATCHED HIS EYES WHILE MISSUS JENNINGS THOUGHT ONLY OF HIS BEHAVIOUR
402-130001-0033 AND WHILE HIS LOOKS OF ANXIOUS SOLICITUDE ON MARIANNE'S FEELING IN HER HEAD AND THROAT THE BEGINNING OF A HEAVY COLD BECAUSE UNEXPRESSED BY WORDS ENTIRELY ESCAPED THE LATTER LADY'S OBSERVATION SHE COULD DISCOVER IN THEM THE QUICK FEELINGS
402-130001-0034 AND NEEDLESS ALARM OF A LOVER TWO DELIGHTFUL TWILIGHT WALKS ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH EVENINGS OF HER BEING THERE NOT MERELY ON THE DRY GRAVEL OF THE SHRUBBERY BUT ALL OVER THE GROUNDS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST DISTANT PARTS OF THEM
402-130001-0035 BY INCREASING AILMENTS ON THE CONCERN OF EVERY BODY AND THE NOTICE OF HERSELF PRESCRIPTIONS POURED IN FROM ALL QUARTERS AND AS USUAL WERE ALL DECLINED THOUGH HEAVY AND FEVERISH WITH A PAIN IN HER LIMBS AND A COUGH AND A SORE THROAT
