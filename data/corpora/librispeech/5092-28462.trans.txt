5092-28462-0000 SHORTLY AFTER OUR RETURN TO WRANGELL THE MISSIONARIES PLANNED A GRAND MISSION EXCURSION UP THE COAST OF THE MAINLAND TO THE CHILCAT COUNTRY WHICH I GLADLY JOINED TOGETHER WITH MISTER VANDERBILT
5092-28462-0001 HIS WIFE AND A FRIEND FROM OREGON THE RIVER STEAMER CASSIAR WAS CHARTERED AND WE HAD HER ALL TO OURSELVES SHIP AND OFFICERS AT OUR COMMAND TO SAIL AND STOP WHERE AND WHEN WE WOULD AND OF COURSE
5092-28462-0002 EVERYBODY FELT IMPORTANT AND HOPEFUL THE MAIN OBJECT OF THE MISSIONARIES WAS TO ASCERTAIN THE SPIRITUAL WANTS OF THE WARLIKE CHILCAT TRIBE WITH A VIEW TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CHURCH AND SCHOOL IN THEIR PRINCIPAL VILLAGE
5092-28462-0003 THE MERCHANT AND HIS PARTY WERE BENT ON BUSINESS AND SCENERY WHILE MY MIND WAS ON THE MOUNTAINS GLACIERS AND FORESTS
5092-28462-0004 AND THE ISLANDS AT THEIR FEET SEEMED TO FLOAT AND DROWSE ON THE SHINING MIRROR WATERS
5092-28462-0005 GLORIOUSLY ARRAYED IN SNOW AND ICE SOME OF THE LARGEST AND MOST RIVER LIKE OF THE GLACIERS FLOWING THROUGH WIDE HIGH WALLED VALLEYS LIKE YOSEMITE THEIR SOURCES FAR BACK AND CONCEALED OTHERS IN PLAIN SIGHT FROM THEIR HIGHEST FOUNTAINS TO THE LEVEL OF THE SEA
5092-28462-0006 CARES OF EVERY KIND WERE QUICKLY FORGOTTEN AND THOUGH THE CASSIAR ENGINES SOON BEGAN TO WHEEZE AND SIGH WITH DOLEFUL SOLEMNITY SUGGESTING COMING TROUBLE WE WERE TOO HAPPY TO MIND THEM EVERY FACE GLOWED WITH NATURAL LOVE OF WILD BEAUTY
5092-28462-0007 GRADUATING INTO OPEN SILVERY FIELDS OF LIGHT AND LOFTY HEADLANDS WITH FINE ARCHING INSTEPS DIPPING THEIR FEET IN THE SHINING WATER
5092-28462-0008 FORGOTTEN NOW WERE THE CHILCATS AND MISSIONS WHILE THE WORD OF GOD WAS BEING READ IN THESE MAJESTIC HIEROGLYPHICS BLAZONED ALONG THE SKY THE EARNEST CHILDISH WONDERMENT WITH WHICH THIS GLORIOUS PAGE OF NATURE'S BIBLE WAS CONTEMPLATED
5092-28462-0009 WAS DELIGHTFUL TO SEE ALL EVINCED EAGER DESIRE TO LEARN IS THAT A GLACIER THEY ASKED DOWN IN THAT CANYON AND IS IT ALL SOLID ICE YES HOW DEEP IS IT
5092-28462-0010 PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND FEET YOU SAY IT FLOWS HOW CAN HARD ICE FLOW
5092-28462-0011 FROM SNOW THAT IS HEAPED UP EVERY WINTER ON THE MOUNTAINS AND HOW THEN IS THE SNOW CHANGED INTO ICE IT IS WELDED BY THE PRESSURE OF ITS OWN WEIGHT ARE THESE WHITE MASSES WE SEE IN THE HOLLOWS GLACIERS ALSO
5092-28462-0012 YES ARE THOSE BLUISH DRAGGLED MASSES HANGING DOWN FROM BENEATH THE SNOW FIELDS WHAT YOU CALL THE SNOUTS OF THE GLACIERS YES WHAT MADE THE HOLLOWS THEY ARE IN THE GLACIERS THEMSELVES
5092-28462-0013 JUST AS TRAVELING ANIMALS MAKE THEIR OWN TRACKS HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN THERE NUMBERLESS CENTURIES
5092-28462-0014 I ANSWERED AS BEST I COULD
5092-28462-0015 IN GENERAL WHILE BUSILY ENGAGED IN SKETCHING AND NOTING MY OWN OBSERVATIONS PREACHING GLACIAL GOSPEL IN A RAMBLING WAY WHILE THE CASSIAR SLOWLY WHEEZING AND CREEPING ALONG THE SHORE
5092-28462-0016 SHIFTED OUR POSITION SO THAT THE ICY CANYONS WERE OPENED TO VIEW AND CLOSED AGAIN IN REGULAR SUCCESSION LIKE THE LEAVES OF A BOOK ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WE WERE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE A NOBLE GROUP OF GLACIERS SOME TEN IN NUMBER
5092-28462-0017 FLOWING FROM A CHAIN OF CRATER LIKE SNOW FOUNTAINS GUARDED AROUND THEIR SUMMITS AND WELL DOWN THEIR SIDES BY JAGGED PEAKS AND COLS AND CURVING MURAL RIDGES
5092-28462-0018 FROM EACH OF THE LARGER CLUSTERS OF FOUNTAINS A WIDE SHEER WALLED CANYON OPENS DOWN TO THE SEA THREE OF THE TRUNK GLACIERS DESCEND TO WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SEA LEVEL THE LARGEST OF THE THREE PROBABLY ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES LONG
5092-28462-0019 AND FROM THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED FEET HIGH FORMING A BARRIER ACROSS THE VALLEY FROM WALL TO WALL IT WAS TO THIS GLACIER THAT THE SHIPS OF THE ALASKA ICE COMPANY RESORTED FOR THE ICE THEY CARRIED TO SAN FRANCISCO AND THE SANDWICH ISLANDS
5092-28462-0020 AND I BELIEVE ALSO TO CHINA AND JAPAN TO LOAD THEY HAD ONLY TO SAIL UP THE FIORD WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE FRONT AND DROP ANCHOR IN THE TERMINAL MORAINE ANOTHER GLACIER A FEW MILES TO THE SOUTH OF THIS ONE
5092-28462-0021 RECEIVES TWO LARGE TRIBUTARIES ABOUT EQUAL IN SIZE AND THEN FLOWS DOWN A FORESTED VALLEY TO WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OR SO OF SEA LEVEL THE THIRD OF THIS LOW DESCENDING GROUP IS FOUR OR FIVE MILES FARTHER SOUTH
5092-28462-0022 THE BOILERS OF OUR LITTLE STEAMER WERE NOT MADE FOR SEA WATER
5092-28462-0023 IN THIS PARTICULAR WE FAILED HOWEVER
5092-28462-0024 THE SUPPLY OF FIFTY TONS OF FRESH WATER BROUGHT FROM WRANGELL HAVING THEN GIVEN OUT
5092-28462-0025 THE CAPTAIN REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR MORE STEAM WHICH THE ENGINEER REFUSED TO FURNISH CAUTIOUSLY KEEPING THE PRESSURE LOW BECAUSE THE SALT WATER FOAMED IN THE BOILERS AND SOME OF IT PASSED OVER INTO THE CYLINDERS CAUSING
5092-28462-0026 IN THE CABIN TO CONSIDER WHAT HAD BETTER BE DONE IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT FOLLOWED MUCH INDIGNATION AND ECONOMY WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT WE HAD CHARTERED THE BOAT FOR SIXTY DOLLARS PER DAY AND THE ROUND TRIP WAS TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN FOUR OR FIVE DAYS
5092-28462-0027 BUT AT THE PRESENT RATE OF SPEED IT WAS FOUND THAT THE COST OF THE TRIP FOR EACH PASSENGER WOULD BE FIVE OR TEN DOLLARS ABOVE THE FIRST ESTIMATE THEREFORE THE MAJORITY RULED THAT WE MUST RETURN NEXT DAY TO WRANGELL
5092-28462-0028 PICEA SITCHENSIS TSUGA HETEROPHYLLA AND T MERTENSIANA WITH A FEW SPECIMENS OF YELLOW CYPRESS THE FERNS WERE DEVELOPED IN REMARKABLE BEAUTY AND SIZE ASPIDIUMS
5092-28462-0029 ONE OF WHICH IS ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH A WOODSIA
5092-28462-0030 AND SEVERAL SPECIES OF POLYPODIUM THE UNDERBRUSH IS CHIEFLY ALDER RUBUS LEDUM THREE SPECIES OF VACCINIUM AND ECHINOPANAX HORRIDA THE WHOLE ABOUT FROM SIX TO EIGHT FEET HIGH
5092-28462-0031 HUMANIZED TERRESTRIALIZED AND ENTERING ONE'S HEART AS TO A HOME PREPARED FOR IT GO WHERE WE WILL ALL THE WORLD OVER WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE
5092-28462-0032 THE STREAM WAS BRIDGED AT SHORT INTERVALS WITH PICTURESQUE MOSS EMBOSSED LOGS AND THE TREES ON ITS BANKS LEANING OVER FROM SIDE TO SIDE MADE HIGH EMBOWERING ARCHES
5092-28462-0033 THE LOG BRIDGE I CROSSED WAS I THINK THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THE KIND I EVER SAW THE MASSIVE LOG IS PLUSHED TO A DEPTH OF SIX INCHES OR MORE WITH MOSSES OF THREE OR FOUR SPECIES
5092-28462-0034 THEIR DIFFERENT TONES OF YELLOW SHADING FINELY INTO EACH OTHER WHILE THEIR DELICATE FRONDED BRANCHES AND FOLIAGE LIE IN EXQUISITE ORDER INCLINING OUTWARD AND DOWN THE SIDES IN RICH FURRED CLASPING SHEETS OVERLAPPING AND FELTED TOGETHER
5092-28462-0035 UNTIL THE REQUIRED THICKNESS IS ATTAINED THE PEDICELS AND SPORE CASES GIVE A PURPLISH TINGE AND THE WHOLE BRIDGE IS ENRICHED WITH FERNS AND A ROW OF SMALL SEEDLING TREES AND CURRANT BUSHES WITH COLORED LEAVES
5092-28462-0036 EVERY ONE OF WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CULLED FROM THE WOODS FOR THIS SPECIAL USE SO PERFECTLY DO THEY HARMONIZE IN SIZE SHAPE AND COLOR WITH THE MOSSY COVER THE WIDTH OF THE SPAN AND THE LUXURIANT BRUSHY ABUTMENTS
