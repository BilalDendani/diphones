4345-7635-0004 THIS CREATURE IS A MONSTER WITHOUT HEART OR CONSIDERATION FOR ANYTHING OR ANYONE SHE IS NOT NEARLY SO DANGEROUS IN THE OPEN AS WHEN SHE HAS THE DARK TO PROTECT HER BESIDES WE KNOW BY OUR OWN EXPERIENCE OF HER MOVEMENTS
4345-7635-0005 THAT FOR SOME REASON SHE SHUNS PUBLICITY IN SPITE OF HER VAST BULK AND ABNORMAL STRENGTH SHE IS AFRAID TO ATTACK OPENLY AFTER ALL SHE IS ONLY A SNAKE AND WITH A SNAKE'S NATURE WHICH IS TO KEEP LOW AND SQUIRM AND PROCEED BY STEALTH AND CUNNING
4345-7635-0006 SHE WILL NEVER ATTACK WHEN SHE CAN RUN AWAY ALTHOUGH SHE KNOWS WELL THAT RUNNING AWAY WOULD PROBABLY BE FATAL TO HER WHAT IS THE LETTER ABOUT SIR NATHANIEL'S VOICE WAS CALM AND SELF POSSESSED WHEN HE WAS ENGAGED IN ANY STRUGGLE OF WITS HE WAS ALL DIPLOMATIST

4345-7635-0012 IS GOING TO BE UTILISED WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS SIR NATHANIEL'S VOICE WAS FULL OF SERIOUSNESS AND IT BROUGHT TO MIMI IN A CONVINCING WAY THE AWFUL GRAVITY OF THE OCCASION IN DUE COURSE THEY SET OUT IN A CARRIAGE DRAWN BY A FINE PAIR OF HORSES
4345-7635-0013 WHO SOON DEVOURED THE FEW MILES OF THEIR JOURNEY BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE GATE SIR NATHANIEL TURNED TO MIMI I HAVE ARRANGED WITH ADAM CERTAIN SIGNALS WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY IF CERTAIN EVENTUALITIES OCCUR THESE NEED BE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU DIRECTLY
4345-7635-0014 BUT BEAR IN MIND THAT IF I ASK YOU OR ADAM TO DO ANYTHING DO NOT LOSE A SECOND IN THE DOING OF IT WE MUST TRY TO PASS OFF SUCH MOMENTS WITH AN APPEARANCE OF UNCONCERN IN ALL PROBABILITY NOTHING REQUIRING SUCH CARE WILL OCCUR
4345-7635-0015 THE WHITE WORM WILL NOT TRY FORCE THOUGH SHE HAS SO MUCH OF IT TO SPARE WHATEVER SHE MAY ATTEMPT TO DAY OF HARM TO ANY OF US WILL BE IN THE WAY OF SECRET PLOT SOME OTHER TIME SHE MAY TRY FORCE BUT IF I AM ABLE TO JUDGE SUCH A THING

4345-7635-0017 IT WILL DOUBTLESS BE SOME ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE BUT NONE THE LESS DANGEROUS ON THAT ACCOUNT HERE WE ARE AT THE GATE NOW BE CAREFUL IN ALL MATTERS HOWEVER SMALL TO KEEP YOUR HEAD IS HALF THE BATTLE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF MEN IN LIVERY IN THE HALL WHEN THEY ARRIVED
4345-7635-0018 THE DOORS OF THE DRAWING ROOM WERE THROWN OPEN AND LADY ARABELLA CAME FORTH AND OFFERED THEM CORDIAL WELCOME THIS HAVING BEEN GOT OVER LADY ARABELLA LED THEM INTO ANOTHER ROOM WHERE TEA WAS SERVED ADAM WAS ACUTELY WATCHFUL AND SUSPICIOUS OF EVERYTHING
4345-7635-0019 AS THE OUTER DOOR OF THE ROOM WHERE WAS THE WELL HOLE WHEREIN OOLANGA HAD DISAPPEARED SOMETHING IN THE SIGHT ALARMED HIM AND HE QUIETLY STOOD NEAR THE DOOR HE MADE NO MOVEMENT EVEN OF HIS EYES BUT HE COULD SEE THAT SIR NATHANIEL WAS WATCHING HIM INTENTLY
4345-7635-0020 AND HE FANCIED WITH APPROVAL THEY ALL SAT NEAR THE TABLE SPREAD FOR TEA ADAM STILL NEAR THE DOOR LADY ARABELLA FANNED HERSELF COMPLAINING OF HEAT AND TOLD ONE OF THE FOOTMEN TO THROW ALL THE OUTER DOORS OPEN
4345-7635-0021 TEA WAS IN PROGRESS WHEN MIMI SUDDENLY STARTED UP WITH A LOOK OF FRIGHT ON HER FACE AT THE SAME MOMENT THE MEN BECAME COGNISANT OF A THICK SMOKE WHICH BEGAN TO SPREAD THROUGH THE ROOM A SMOKE WHICH MADE THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED IT GASP AND CHOKE
4345-7635-0022 THE FOOTMEN BEGAN TO EDGE UNEASILY TOWARDS THE INNER DOOR DENSER AND DENSER GREW THE SMOKE AND MORE ACRID ITS SMELL MIMI TOWARDS WHOM THE DRAUGHT FROM THE OPEN DOOR WAFTED THE SMOKE ROSE UP CHOKING AND RAN TO THE INNER DOOR WHICH SHE THREW OPEN TO ITS FULLEST EXTENT
4345-7635-0023 AND IN HER FRIGHT SHE TORE DOWN THE CURTAIN WHICH ENVELOPED HER FROM HEAD TO FOOT THEN SHE RAN THROUGH THE STILL OPEN DOOR HEEDLESS OF THE FACT THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE WHERE SHE WAS GOING ADAM FOLLOWED BY SIR NATHANIEL RUSHED FORWARD AND JOINED HER
4345-7635-0024 ADAM CATCHING HIS WIFE BY THE ARM AND HOLDING HER TIGHT IT WAS WELL THAT HE DID SO FOR JUST BEFORE HER LAY THE BLACK ORIFICE OF THE WELL HOLE WHICH OF COURSE SHE COULD NOT SEE WITH THE SILK CURTAIN ROUND HER HEAD THE FLOOR WAS EXTREMELY SLIPPERY
4345-7635-0025 SOMETHING LIKE THICK OIL HAD BEEN SPILLED WHERE SHE HAD TO PASS AND CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE HOLE HER FEET SHOT FROM UNDER HER AND SHE STUMBLED FORWARD TOWARDS THE WELL HOLE WHEN ADAM SAW MIMI SLIP HE FLUNG HIMSELF BACKWARD STILL HOLDING HER
4345-7635-0026 HIS WEIGHT TOLD AND HE DRAGGED HER UP FROM THE HOLE AND THEY FELL TOGETHER ON THE FLOOR OUTSIDE THE ZONE OF SLIPPERINESS IN A MOMENT HE HAD RAISED HER UP AND TOGETHER THEY RUSHED OUT THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR INTO THE SUNLIGHT SIR NATHANIEL CLOSE BEHIND THEM
4345-7635-0027 THEY WERE ALL PALE EXCEPT THE OLD DIPLOMATIST WHO LOOKED BOTH CALM AND COOL
4345-7635-0028 BOTH MANAGED TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE
4345-7635-0029 WHO SAW THE THREE WHO HAD JUST ESCAPED A TERRIBLE DANGER WALKING TOGETHER GAILY AS UNDER THE GUIDING PRESSURE OF SIR NATHANIEL'S HAND THEY TURNED TO RE ENTER THE HOUSE LADY ARABELLA WHOSE FACE HAD BLANCHED TO A DEADLY WHITE
4345-7635-0030 NOW RESUMED HER MINISTRATIONS AT THE TEA BOARD AS THOUGH NOTHING UNUSUAL HAD HAPPENED THE SLOP BASIN WAS FULL OF HALF BURNED BROWN PAPER OVER WHICH TEA HAD BEEN POURED SIR NATHANIEL HAD BEEN NARROWLY OBSERVING HIS HOSTESS
4345-7635-0031 THE REAL ATTACK IS TO COME SHE IS TOO QUIET
4345-7635-0032 COME WITH US AND CAUTION HER TO HURRY DON'T LOSE A SECOND EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SCENE
4345-7635-0033 BROUGHT IN FRESH TEA THENCE ON THAT TEA PARTY SEEMED TO ADAM WHOSE FACULTIES WERE AT THEIR UTMOST INTENSITY LIKE A TERRIBLE DREAM AS FOR POOR MIMI SHE WAS SO OVERWROUGHT BOTH WITH PRESENT AND FUTURE FEAR AND WITH HORROR AT THE DANGER SHE HAD ESCAPED
4345-7635-0034 THAT HER FACULTIES WERE NUMB HOWEVER SHE WAS BRACED UP FOR A TRIAL AND SHE FELT ASSURED THAT WHATEVER MIGHT COME SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH WITH IT SIR NATHANIEL SEEMED JUST AS USUAL SUAVE DIGNIFIED AND THOUGHTFUL PERFECT MASTER OF HIMSELF
4345-7635-0035 TO HER HUSBAND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MIMI WAS ILL AT EASE THE WAY SHE KEPT TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK AROUND HER THE QUICK COMING AND GOING OF THE COLOUR OF HER FACE HER HURRIED BREATHING ALTERNATING WITH PERIODS OF SUSPICIOUS CALM WERE EVIDENCES OF MENTAL PERTURBATION
4345-7635-0036 TO HER THE ATTITUDE OF LADY ARABELLA SEEMED COMPOUNDED OF SOCIAL SWEETNESS AND PERSONAL CONSIDERATION IT WOULD BE HARD TO IMAGINE MORE THOUGHTFUL AND TENDER KINDNESS TOWARDS AN HONOURED GUEST WHEN TEA WAS OVER AND THE SERVANTS HAD COME TO CLEAR AWAY THE CUPS
4345-7635-0037 LADY ARABELLA PUTTING HER ARM ROUND MIMI'S WAIST STROLLED WITH HER INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHERE SHE COLLECTED A NUMBER OF PHOTOGRAPHS WHICH WERE SCATTERED ABOUT AND SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER GUEST BEGAN TO SHOW THEM TO HER
4345-7635-0038 AS WELL AS THAT WHICH OPENED FROM THE ROOM OUTSIDE THAT OF THE WELL HOLE INTO THE AVENUE SUDDENLY WITHOUT ANY SEEMING CAUSE THE LIGHT IN THE ROOM BEGAN TO GROW DIM SIR NATHANIEL WHO WAS SITTING CLOSE TO MIMI ROSE TO HIS FEET AND CRYING QUICK
4345-7635-0039 CAUGHT HOLD OF HER HAND AND BEGAN TO DRAG HER FROM THE ROOM ADAM CAUGHT HER OTHER HAND AND BETWEEN THEM THEY DREW HER THROUGH THE OUTER DOOR WHICH THE SERVANTS WERE BEGINNING TO CLOSE IT WAS DIFFICULT AT FIRST TO FIND THE WAY THE DARKNESS WAS SO GREAT
4345-7635-0040 BUT TO THEIR RELIEF WHEN ADAM WHISTLED SHRILLY THE CARRIAGE AND HORSES WHICH HAD BEEN WAITING IN THE ANGLE OF THE AVENUE DASHED UP HER HUSBAND AND SIR NATHANIEL LIFTED ALMOST THREW MIMI INTO THE CARRIAGE
4345-7635-0041 THE POSTILLION PLIED WHIP AND SPUR AND THE VEHICLE ROCKING WITH ITS SPEED SWEPT THROUGH THE GATE AND TORE UP THE ROAD BEHIND THEM WAS A HUBBUB
4345-7635-0042 AND SOMEWHERE SEEMINGLY FAR BACK IN THE HOUSE A STRANGE NOISE EVERY NERVE OF THE HORSES WAS STRAINED AS THEY DASHED RECKLESSLY ALONG THE ROAD THE TWO MEN HELD MIMI BETWEEN THEM THE ARMS OF BOTH OF THEM ROUND HER AS THOUGH PROTECTINGLY
4345-7635-0043 AS THEY WENT THERE WAS A SUDDEN RISE IN THE GROUND BUT THE HORSES BREATHING HEAVILY DASHED UP IT AT RACING SPEED NOT SLACKENING THEIR PACE WHEN THE HILL FELL AWAY AGAIN LEAVING THEM TO HURRY ALONG THE DOWNGRADE
4345-7635-0044 IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO SAY THAT NEITHER ADAM NOR MIMI HAD ANY FEAR IN RETURNING TO DOOM TOWER MIMI FELT IT MORE KEENLY THAN HER HUSBAND WHOSE NERVES WERE HARDER AND WHO WAS MORE INURED TO DANGER STILL SHE BORE UP BRAVELY
4345-7635-0045 AND AS USUAL THE EFFORT WAS HELPFUL TO HER WHEN ONCE SHE WAS IN THE STUDY IN THE TOP OF THE TURRET SHE ALMOST FORGOT THE TERRORS WHICH LAY OUTSIDE IN THE DARK SHE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO PEEP OUT OF THE WINDOW BUT ADAM DID AND SAW NOTHING
4345-7635-0046 THE MOONLIGHT SHOWED ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY BUT NOWHERE WAS TO BE OBSERVED THAT TREMULOUS LINE OF GREEN LIGHT THE PEACEFUL NIGHT HAD A GOOD EFFECT ON THEM ALL DANGER BEING UNSEEN SEEMED FAR OFF
4345-7635-0047 AT TIMES IT WAS HARD TO REALISE THAT IT HAD EVER BEEN WITH COURAGE RESTORED ADAM ROSE EARLY AND WALKED ALONG THE BROW SEEING NO CHANGE IN THE SIGNS OF LIFE IN CASTRA REGIS WHAT HE DID SEE TO HIS WONDER AND CONCERN
4345-7635-0048 ON HIS RETURNING HOMEWARD WAS LADY ARABELLA IN HER TIGHT FITTING WHITE DRESS AND ERMINE COLLAR BUT WITHOUT HER EMERALDS SHE WAS EMERGING FROM THE GATE OF DIANA'S GROVE AND WALKING TOWARDS THE CASTLE
4345-7635-0049 PONDERING ON THIS AND TRYING TO FIND SOME MEANING IN IT OCCUPIED HIS THOUGHTS TILL HE JOINED MIMI AND SIR NATHANIEL AT BREAKFAST THEY BEGAN THE MEAL IN SILENCE WHAT HAD BEEN HAD BEEN AND WAS KNOWN TO THEM ALL MOREOVER IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT TOPIC
4345-7635-0050 A FILLIP WAS GIVEN TO THE CONVERSATION WHEN ADAM TOLD OF HIS SEEING LADY ARABELLA ON HER WAY TO CASTRA REGIS THEY EACH HAD SOMETHING TO SAY OF HER AND OF WHAT HER WISHES OR INTENTIONS WERE TOWARDS EDGAR CASWALL
4345-7635-0051 MIMI SPOKE BITTERLY OF HER IN EVERY ASPECT SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN AND NEVER WOULD NEVER COULD THE OCCASION WHEN TO HARM LILLA THE WOMAN HAD CONSORTED EVEN WITH THE NIGGER
4345-7635-0052 AS A SOCIAL MATTER SHE WAS DISGUSTED WITH HER FOR FOLLOWING UP THE RICH LANDOWNER THROWING HERSELF AT HIS HEAD SO SHAMELESSLY WAS HOW SHE EXPRESSED IT SHE WAS INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT THE GREAT KITE STILL FLEW FROM CASWALL'S TOWER
4345-7635-0053 BUT BEYOND SUCH MATTERS SHE DID NOT TRY TO GO THE ONLY COMMENT SHE MADE WAS OF STRONGLY EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT HER LADYSHIP'S CHEEK IN IGNORING HER OWN CRIMINAL ACTS AND HER IMPUDENCE IN TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT OTHERS HAD OVERLOOKED THEM ALSO
