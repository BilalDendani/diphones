1724-395-0000 TRANSITION FROM THE COMMON RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF MORALITY TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE CONCEIVED IN THE WORLD OR EVEN OUT OF IT WHICH CAN BE CALLED GOOD WITHOUT QUALIFICATION EXCEPT A GOOD WILL
1724-395-0001 INTELLIGENCE WIT JUDGEMENT AND THE OTHER TALENTS OF THE MIND HOWEVER THEY MAY BE NAMED OR COURAGE RESOLUTION PERSEVERANCE AS QUALITIES OF TEMPERAMENT ARE UNDOUBTEDLY GOOD AND DESIRABLE IN MANY RESPECTS
1724-395-0002 IF THE WILL WHICH IS TO MAKE USE OF THEM AND WHICH THEREFORE CONSTITUTES WHAT IS CALLED CHARACTER IS NOT GOOD IT IS THE SAME WITH THE GIFTS OF FORTUNE POWER RICHES HONOUR EVEN HEALTH
1724-395-0003 AND THE GENERAL WELL BEING AND CONTENTMENT WITH ONE'S CONDITION WHICH IS CALLED HAPPINESS INSPIRE PRIDE AND OFTEN PRESUMPTION IF THERE IS NOT A GOOD WILL TO CORRECT THE INFLUENCE OF THESE ON THE MIND
1724-395-0004 AND WITH THIS ALSO TO RECTIFY THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF ACTING AND ADAPT IT TO ITS END THE SIGHT OF A BEING WHO IS NOT ADORNED WITH A SINGLE FEATURE OF A PURE AND GOOD WILL ENJOYING UNBROKEN PROSPERITY
1724-395-0005 CAN NEVER GIVE PLEASURE TO AN IMPARTIAL RATIONAL SPECTATOR THUS A GOOD WILL APPEARS TO CONSTITUTE THE INDISPENSABLE CONDITION EVEN OF BEING WORTHY OF HAPPINESS
1724-395-0006 AND THIS QUALIFIES THE ESTEEM THAT WE JUSTLY HAVE FOR THEM AND DOES NOT PERMIT US TO REGARD THEM AS ABSOLUTELY GOOD MODERATION IN THE AFFECTIONS AND PASSIONS SELF CONTROL AND CALM DELIBERATION
1724-395-0007 ARE NOT ONLY GOOD IN MANY RESPECTS BUT EVEN SEEM TO CONSTITUTE PART OF THE INTRINSIC WORTH OF THE PERSON BUT THEY ARE FAR FROM DESERVING TO BE CALLED GOOD WITHOUT QUALIFICATION ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN SO UNCONDITIONALLY PRAISED BY THE ANCIENTS
1724-395-0008 THAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT IT A GOOD WILL IS GOOD NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT PERFORMS OR EFFECTS NOT BY ITS APTNESS FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF SOME PROPOSED END BUT SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF THE VOLITION THAT IS
1724-395-0009 THEN LIKE A JEWEL IT WOULD STILL SHINE BY ITS OWN LIGHT AS A THING WHICH HAS ITS WHOLE VALUE IN ITSELF ITS USEFULNESS OR FRUITLESSNESS CAN NEITHER ADD NOR TAKE AWAY ANYTHING FROM THIS VALUE
1724-395-0010 IT WOULD BE AS IT WERE ONLY THE SETTING TO ENABLE US TO HANDLE IT THE MORE CONVENIENTLY IN COMMON COMMERCE OR TO ATTRACT TO IT THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT YET CONNOISSEURS BUT NOT TO RECOMMEND IT TO TRUE CONNOISSEURS
1724-395-0011 OF EVEN COMMON REASON TO THE IDEA YET A SUSPICION MUST ARISE THAT IT MAY PERHAPS REALLY BE THE PRODUCT OF MERE HIGH FLOWN FANCY AND THAT WE MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE OF NATURE IN ASSIGNING REASON
1724-395-0012 AS THE GOVERNOR OF OUR WILL THEREFORE WE WILL EXAMINE THIS IDEA FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW IN THE PHYSICAL CONSTITUTION OF AN ORGANIZED BEING THAT IS A BEING ADAPTED SUITABLY TO THE PURPOSES OF LIFE
1724-395-0013 WE ASSUME IT AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT NO ORGAN FOR ANY PURPOSE WILL BE FOUND BUT WHAT IS ALSO THE FITTEST AND BEST ADAPTED FOR THAT PURPOSE NOW IN A BEING WHICH HAS REASON AND A WILL
1724-395-0014 IF THE PROPER OBJECT OF NATURE WERE ITS CONSERVATION ITS WELFARE IN A WORD ITS HAPPINESS THEN NATURE WOULD HAVE HIT UPON A VERY BAD ARRANGEMENT IN SELECTING THE REASON OF THE CREATURE TO CARRY OUT THIS PURPOSE
1724-395-0015 AND TO FEEL THANKFUL FOR IT TO THE BENEFICENT CAUSE BUT NOT THAT IT SHOULD SUBJECT ITS DESIRES TO THAT WEAK AND DELUSIVE GUIDANCE AND MEDDLE BUNGLINGLY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NATURE IN A WORD NATURE WOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE
1724-395-0016 THAT REASON SHOULD NOT BREAK FORTH INTO PRACTICAL EXERCISE NOR HAVE THE PRESUMPTION WITH ITS WEAK INSIGHT TO THINK OUT FOR ITSELF THE PLAN OF HAPPINESS AND OF THE MEANS OF ATTAINING IT
1724-395-0017 NATURE WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE TAKEN ON HERSELF THE CHOICE OF THE ENDS BUT ALSO OF THE MEANS AND WITH WISE FORESIGHT WOULD HAVE ENTRUSTED BOTH TO INSTINCT AND IN FACT
1724-395-0018 WE FIND THAT THE MORE A CULTIVATED REASON APPLIES ITSELF WITH DELIBERATE PURPOSE TO THE ENJOYMENT OF LIFE AND HAPPINESS SO MUCH THE MORE DOES THE MAN FAIL OF TRUE SATISFACTION
1724-395-0019 AND FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THERE ARISES IN MANY IF THEY ARE CANDID ENOUGH TO CONFESS IT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF MISOLOGY THAT IS HATRED OF REASON ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST EXPERIENCED IN THE USE OF IT
1724-395-0020 THAT THEY HAVE IN FACT ONLY BROUGHT MORE TROUBLE ON THEIR SHOULDERS RATHER THAN GAINED IN HAPPINESS AND THEY END BY ENVYING RATHER THAN DESPISING THE MORE COMMON STAMP OF MEN WHO KEEP CLOSER TO THE GUIDANCE OF MERE INSTINCT
1724-395-0021 AND DO NOT ALLOW THEIR REASON MUCH INFLUENCE ON THEIR CONDUCT AND THIS WE MUST ADMIT THAT THE JUDGEMENT OF THOSE WHO WOULD VERY MUCH LOWER THE LOFTY EULOGIES OF THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REASON GIVES US IN REGARD TO THE HAPPINESS
1724-395-0022 THE IDEA THAT OUR EXISTENCE HAS A DIFFERENT AND FAR NOBLER END FOR WHICH AND NOT FOR HAPPINESS REASON IS PROPERLY INTENDED AND WHICH MUST THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS THE SUPREME CONDITION
1724-395-0023 TO WHICH THE PRIVATE ENDS OF MAN MUST FOR THE MOST PART BE POSTPONED FOR AS REASON IS NOT COMPETENT TO GUIDE THE WILL WITH CERTAINTY IN REGARD TO ITS OBJECTS AND THE SATISFACTION OF ALL OUR WANTS
1724-395-0024 AS ONE WHICH IS TO HAVE INFLUENCE ON THE WILL THEREFORE ADMITTING THAT NATURE GENERALLY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF HER CAPACITIES HAS ADAPTED THE MEANS TO THE END ITS TRUE DESTINATION MUST BE TO PRODUCE A WILL
1724-395-0025 NOT MERELY GOOD AS A MEANS TO SOMETHING ELSE BUT GOOD IN ITSELF FOR WHICH REASON WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THIS WILL THEN THOUGH NOT INDEED THE SOLE AND COMPLETE GOOD MUST BE THE SUPREME GOOD
1724-395-0026 WHICH IS REQUISITE FOR THE FIRST AND UNCONDITIONAL PURPOSE DOES IN MANY WAYS INTERFERE AT LEAST IN THIS LIFE WITH THE ATTAINMENT OF THE SECOND WHICH IS ALWAYS CONDITIONAL NAMELY HAPPINESS
1724-395-0027 NAY IT MAY EVEN REDUCE IT TO NOTHING WITHOUT NATURE THEREBY FAILING OF HER PURPOSE FOR REASON RECOGNIZES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A GOOD WILL AS ITS HIGHEST PRACTICAL DESTINATION AND IN ATTAINING THIS PURPOSE
1724-395-0028 IS CAPABLE ONLY OF A SATISFACTION OF ITS OWN PROPER KIND NAMELY THAT FROM THE ATTAINMENT OF AN END WHICH END AGAIN IS DETERMINED BY REASON ONLY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THIS MAY INVOLVE MANY A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE ENDS OF INCLINATION
1724-395-0029 AND IS GOOD WITHOUT A VIEW TO ANYTHING FURTHER A NOTION WHICH EXISTS ALREADY IN THE SOUND NATURAL UNDERSTANDING REQUIRING RATHER TO BE CLEARED UP THAN TO BE TAUGHT AND WHICH IN ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF OUR ACTIONS
1724-395-0030 ALWAYS TAKES THE FIRST PLACE AND CONSTITUTES THE CONDITION OF ALL THE REST IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE WILL TAKE THE NOTION OF DUTY WHICH INCLUDES THAT OF A GOOD WILL ALTHOUGH IMPLYING CERTAIN SUBJECTIVE RESTRICTIONS AND HINDRANCES
1724-395-0031 THESE HOWEVER FAR FROM CONCEALING IT OR RENDERING IT UNRECOGNIZABLE RATHER BRING IT OUT BY CONTRAST AND MAKE IT SHINE FORTH SO MUCH THE BRIGHTER
1724-395-0032 I OMIT HERE ALL ACTIONS WHICH ARE ALREADY RECOGNIZED AS INCONSISTENT WITH DUTY ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE USEFUL FOR THIS OR THAT PURPOSE FOR WITH THESE THE QUESTION WHETHER THEY ARE DONE FROM DUTY CANNOT ARISE AT ALL
1724-395-0033 SINCE THEY EVEN CONFLICT WITH IT I ALSO SET ASIDE THOSE ACTIONS WHICH REALLY CONFORM TO DUTY BUT TO WHICH MEN HAVE NO DIRECT INCLINATION
1724-395-0034 FOR IN THIS CASE WE CAN READILY DISTINGUISH WHETHER THE ACTION WHICH AGREES WITH DUTY IS DONE FROM DUTY OR FROM A SELFISH VIEW
1724-395-0035 AND WHEREVER THERE IS MUCH COMMERCE THE PRUDENT TRADESMAN DOES NOT OVERCHARGE BUT KEEPS A FIXED PRICE FOR EVERYONE SO THAT A CHILD BUYS OF HIM AS WELL AS ANY OTHER MEN ARE THUS HONESTLY SERVED
1724-395-0036 IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION IN THIS CASE TO SUPPOSE THAT HE MIGHT BESIDES HAVE A DIRECT INCLINATION IN FAVOUR OF THE BUYERS SO THAT AS IT WERE FROM LOVE HE SHOULD GIVE NO ADVANTAGE TO ONE OVER ANOTHER ACCORDINGLY THE ACTION WAS DONE NEITHER FROM DUTY
1724-395-0037 NOR FROM DIRECT INCLINATION BUT MERELY WITH A SELFISH VIEW ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS A DUTY TO MAINTAIN ONE'S LIFE AND IN ADDITION EVERYONE HAS ALSO A DIRECT INCLINATION TO DO SO BUT ON THIS ACCOUNT
1724-395-0038 THEY PRESERVE THEIR LIFE AS DUTY REQUIRES NO DOUBT BUT NOT BECAUSE DUTY REQUIRES
1724-395-0039 IF ADVERSITY AND HOPELESS SORROW HAVE COMPLETELY TAKEN AWAY THE RELISH FOR LIFE IF THE UNFORTUNATE ONE STRONG IN MIND INDIGNANT AT HIS FATE RATHER THAN DESPONDING OR DEJECTED WISHES FOR DEATH
1724-395-0040 AND YET PRESERVES HIS LIFE WITHOUT LOVING IT NOT FROM INCLINATION OR FEAR BUT FROM DUTY THEN HIS MAXIM HAS A MORAL WORTH TO BE BENEFICENT WHEN WE CAN IS A DUTY AND BESIDES THIS
1724-395-0041 THERE ARE MANY MINDS SO SYMPATHETICALLY CONSTITUTED THAT WITHOUT ANY OTHER MOTIVE OF VANITY OR SELF INTEREST THEY FIND A PLEASURE IN SPREADING JOY AROUND THEM AND CAN TAKE DELIGHT IN THE SATISFACTION OF OTHERS SO FAR AS IT IS THEIR OWN WORK
1724-395-0042 BUT I MAINTAIN THAT IN SUCH A CASE AN ACTION OF THIS KIND HOWEVER PROPER HOWEVER AMIABLE IT MAY BE HAS NEVERTHELESS NO TRUE MORAL WORTH BUT IS ON A LEVEL WITH OTHER INCLINATIONS
1724-395-0043 WHICH IF IT IS HAPPILY DIRECTED TO THAT WHICH IS IN FACT OF PUBLIC UTILITY AND ACCORDANT WITH DUTY AND CONSEQUENTLY HONOURABLE DESERVES PRAISE AND ENCOURAGEMENT BUT NOT ESTEEM FOR
1724-395-0044 WITHOUT ANY INCLINATION TO IT BUT SIMPLY FROM DUTY THEN FIRST HAS HIS ACTION ITS GENUINE MORAL WORTH FURTHER STILL IF NATURE HAS PUT LITTLE SYMPATHY IN THE HEART OF THIS OR THAT MAN
1724-395-0045 IF HE SUPPOSED TO BE AN UPRIGHT MAN IS BY TEMPERAMENT COLD AND INDIFFERENT TO THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE IN RESPECT OF HIS OWN
1724-395-0046 WOULD HE NOT STILL FIND IN HIMSELF A SOURCE FROM WHENCE TO GIVE HIMSELF A FAR HIGHER WORTH THAN THAT OF A GOOD NATURED TEMPERAMENT COULD BE UNQUESTIONABLY IT IS JUST IN THIS THAT THE MORAL WORTH OF THE CHARACTER IS BROUGHT OUT
1724-395-0047 WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY THE HIGHEST OF ALL NAMELY THAT HE IS BENEFICENT NOT FROM INCLINATION BUT FROM DUTY
1724-395-0048 FOR DISCONTENT WITH ONE'S CONDITION UNDER A PRESSURE OF MANY ANXIETIES AND AMIDST UNSATISFIED WANTS MIGHT EASILY BECOME A GREAT TEMPTATION TO TRANSGRESSION OF DUTY BUT HERE AGAIN WITHOUT LOOKING TO DUTY
1724-395-0049 ALL MEN HAVE ALREADY THE STRONGEST AND MOST INTIMATE INCLINATION TO HAPPINESS BECAUSE IT IS JUST IN THIS IDEA THAT ALL INCLINATIONS ARE COMBINED IN ONE TOTAL BUT THE PRECEPT OF HAPPINESS IS OFTEN OF SUCH A SORT
1724-395-0050 THAT IT GREATLY INTERFERES WITH SOME INCLINATIONS AND YET A MAN CANNOT FORM ANY DEFINITE AND CERTAIN CONCEPTION OF THE SUM OF SATISFACTION OF ALL OF THEM WHICH IS CALLED HAPPINESS
1724-395-0051 THAT A SINGLE INCLINATION DEFINITE BOTH AS TO WHAT IT PROMISES AND AS TO THE TIME WITHIN WHICH IT CAN BE GRATIFIED IS OFTEN ABLE TO OVERCOME SUCH A FLUCTUATING IDEA AND THAT A GOUTY PATIENT FOR INSTANCE
1724-395-0052 CAN CHOOSE TO ENJOY WHAT HE LIKES AND TO SUFFER WHAT HE MAY SINCE ACCORDING TO HIS CALCULATION ON THIS OCCASION AT LEAST
1724-395-0053 TO A POSSIBLY MISTAKEN EXPECTATION OF A HAPPINESS WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOUND IN HEALTH BUT EVEN IN THIS CASE IF THE GENERAL DESIRE FOR HAPPINESS DID NOT INFLUENCE HIS WILL AND SUPPOSING THAT IN HIS PARTICULAR CASE
1724-395-0054 HEALTH WAS NOT A NECESSARY ELEMENT IN THIS CALCULATION THERE YET REMAINS IN THIS AS IN ALL OTHER CASES THIS LAW NAMELY THAT HE SHOULD PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS NOT FROM INCLINATION BUT FROM DUTY AND BY THIS
1724-395-0055 WOULD HIS CONDUCT FIRST ACQUIRE TRUE MORAL WORTH IT IS IN THIS MANNER UNDOUBTEDLY THAT WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE ALSO IN WHICH WE ARE COMMANDED TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR EVEN OUR ENEMY
1724-395-0056 FOR LOVE AS AN AFFECTION CANNOT BE COMMANDED BUT BENEFICENCE FOR DUTY'S SAKE MAY
1724-395-0057 NAY ARE EVEN REPELLED BY A NATURAL AND UNCONQUERABLE AVERSION THIS IS PRACTICAL LOVE AND NOT PATHOLOGICAL A LOVE WHICH IS SEATED IN THE WILL AND NOT IN THE PROPENSIONS OF SENSE IN PRINCIPLES OF ACTION
1724-395-0058 AND NOT OF TENDER SYMPATHY AND IT IS THIS LOVE ALONE WHICH CAN BE COMMANDED THE SECOND PROPOSITION IS THAT AN ACTION DONE FROM DUTY DERIVES ITS MORAL WORTH NOT FROM THE PURPOSE WHICH IS TO BE ATTAINED BY IT
1724-395-0059 IT IS CLEAR FROM WHAT PRECEDES THAT THE PURPOSES WHICH WE MAY HAVE IN VIEW IN OUR ACTIONS OR THEIR EFFECTS REGARDED AS ENDS AND SPRINGS OF THE WILL CANNOT GIVE TO ACTIONS ANY UNCONDITIONAL OR MORAL WORTH
1724-395-0060 IN WHAT THEN CAN THEIR WORTH LIE IF IT IS NOT TO CONSIST IN THE WILL AND IN REFERENCE TO ITS EXPECTED EFFECT IT CANNOT LIE ANYWHERE BUT IN THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WILL WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ENDS WHICH CAN BE ATTAINED BY THE ACTION
1724-395-0061 FOR THE WILL STANDS BETWEEN ITS A PRIORI PRINCIPLE WHICH IS FORMAL AND ITS A POSTERIORI SPRING WHICH IS MATERIAL AS BETWEEN TWO ROADS
1724-395-0062 FORMAL PRINCIPLE OF VOLITION WHEN AN ACTION IS DONE FROM DUTY IN WHICH CASE EVERY MATERIAL PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM IT THE THIRD PROPOSITION WHICH IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE TWO PRECEDING I WOULD EXPRESS THUS
1724-395-0063 DUTY IS THE NECESSITY OF ACTING FROM RESPECT FOR THE LAW I MAY HAVE INCLINATION FOR AN OBJECT AS THE EFFECT OF MY PROPOSED ACTION BUT I CANNOT HAVE RESPECT FOR IT JUST FOR THIS REASON THAT IT IS AN EFFECT AND NOT AN ENERGY OF WILL
1724-395-0064 SIMILARLY I CANNOT HAVE RESPECT FOR INCLINATION WHETHER MY OWN OR ANOTHER'S I CAN AT MOST IF MY OWN APPROVE IT IF ANOTHER'S SOMETIMES EVEN LOVE IT I E LOOK ON IT AS FAVOURABLE TO MY OWN INTEREST
1724-395-0065 IT IS ONLY WHAT IS CONNECTED WITH MY WILL AS A PRINCIPLE BY NO MEANS AS AN EFFECT WHAT DOES NOT SUBSERVE MY INCLINATION BUT OVERPOWERS IT OR AT LEAST IN CASE OF CHOICE EXCLUDES IT FROM ITS CALCULATION IN OTHER WORDS
1724-395-0066 SIMPLY THE LAW OF ITSELF WHICH CAN BE AN OBJECT OF RESPECT AND HENCE A COMMAND NOW AN ACTION DONE FROM DUTY MUST WHOLLY EXCLUDE THE INFLUENCE OF INCLINATION AND WITH IT EVERY OBJECT OF THE WILL
1724-395-0067 SO THAT NOTHING REMAINS WHICH CAN DETERMINE THE WILL EXCEPT OBJECTIVELY THE LAW AND SUBJECTIVELY PURE RESPECT FOR THIS PRACTICAL LAW AND CONSEQUENTLY THE MAXIM THAT I SHOULD FOLLOW THIS LAW EVEN TO THE THWARTING OF ALL MY INCLINATIONS
1724-395-0068 A MAXIM IS THE SUBJECTIVE PRINCIPLE OF VOLITION
1724-395-0069 THAT WHICH WOULD ALSO SERVE SUBJECTIVELY AS A PRACTICAL PRINCIPLE TO ALL RATIONAL BEINGS IF REASON HAD FULL POWER OVER THE FACULTY OF DESIRE
1724-395-0070 FOR ALL THESE EFFECTS AGREEABLENESS OF ONE'S CONDITION AND EVEN THE PROMOTION OF THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS COULD HAVE BEEN ALSO BROUGHT ABOUT BY OTHER CAUSES SO THAT FOR THIS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NEED OF THE WILL OF A RATIONAL BEING
1724-395-0071 WHEREAS IT IS IN THIS ALONE THAT THE SUPREME AND UNCONDITIONAL GOOD CAN BE FOUND THE PRE EMINENT GOOD WHICH WE CALL MORAL CAN THEREFORE CONSIST IN NOTHING ELSE THAN THE CONCEPTION OF LAW IN ITSELF
1724-395-0072 WHICH CERTAINLY IS ONLY POSSIBLE IN A RATIONAL BEING IN SO FAR AS THIS CONCEPTION AND NOT THE EXPECTED EFFECT DETERMINES THE WILL THIS IS A GOOD WHICH IS ALREADY PRESENT IN THE PERSON WHO ACTS ACCORDINGLY
1724-395-0073 IT MIGHT BE HERE OBJECTED TO ME THAT I TAKE REFUGE BEHIND THE WORD RESPECT IN AN OBSCURE FEELING INSTEAD OF GIVING A DISTINCT SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION BY A CONCEPT OF THE REASON BUT ALTHOUGH RESPECT IS A FEELING
1724-395-0074 IT IS NOT A FEELING RECEIVED THROUGH INFLUENCE
1724-395-0075 AND THEREFORE IS SPECIFICALLY DISTINCT FROM ALL FEELINGS OF THE FORMER KIND WHICH MAY BE REFERRED EITHER TO INCLINATION OR FEAR
1724-395-0076 I RECOGNISE WITH RESPECT THIS MERELY SIGNIFIES THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MY WILL IS SUBORDINATE TO A LAW WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF OTHER INFLUENCES ON MY SENSE THE IMMEDIATE DETERMINATION OF THE WILL BY THE LAW
1724-395-0077 AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS IS CALLED RESPECT
1724-395-0078 RESPECT IS PROPERLY
1724-395-0079 WHICH THWARTS MY SELF LOVE
1724-395-0080 THE EXAMPLE OF A LAW VIZ TO BECOME LIKE HIM IN THIS BY EXERCISE AND THIS CONSTITUTES OUR RESPECT ALL SO CALLED MORAL INTEREST CONSISTS SIMPLY IN RESPECT FOR THE LAW
1724-395-0081 BUT WHAT SORT OF LAW CAN THAT BE THE CONCEPTION OF WHICH MUST DETERMINE THE WILL EVEN WITHOUT PAYING ANY REGARD TO THE EFFECT EXPECTED FROM IT IN ORDER THAT THIS WILL MAY BE CALLED GOOD ABSOLUTELY AND WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
1724-395-0082 AS I HAVE DEPRIVED THE WILL OF EVERY IMPULSE WHICH COULD ARISE TO IT FROM OBEDIENCE TO ANY LAW THERE REMAINS NOTHING BUT THE UNIVERSAL CONFORMITY OF ITS ACTIONS TO LAW IN GENERAL WHICH ALONE IS TO SERVE THE WILL AS A PRINCIPLE
1724-395-0083 THAT MY MAXIM SHOULD BECOME A UNIVERSAL LAW HERE NOW IT IS THE SIMPLE CONFORMITY TO LAW IN GENERAL
1724-395-0084 THAT SERVES THE WILL AS ITS PRINCIPLE AND MUST SO SERVE IT IF DUTY IS NOT TO BE A VAIN DELUSION AND A CHIMERICAL NOTION THE COMMON REASON OF MEN IN ITS PRACTICAL JUDGEMENTS PERFECTLY COINCIDES WITH THIS
1724-395-0085 AND ALWAYS HAS IN VIEW THE PRINCIPLE HERE SUGGESTED LET THE QUESTION BE FOR EXAMPLE MAY I WHEN IN DISTRESS MAKE A PROMISE WITH THE INTENTION NOT TO KEEP IT I READILY DISTINGUISH HERE BETWEEN THE TWO SIGNIFICATIONS
1724-395-0086 BUT IT MUST BE WELL CONSIDERED WHETHER THERE MAY NOT HEREAFTER SPRING FROM THIS LIE MUCH GREATER INCONVENIENCE THAN THAT FROM WHICH I NOW FREE MYSELF AND AS WITH ALL MY SUPPOSED CUNNING THE CONSEQUENCES CANNOT BE SO EASILY FORESEEN
1724-395-0087 BUT THAT CREDIT ONCE LOST MAY BE MUCH MORE INJURIOUS TO ME THAN ANY MISCHIEF WHICH I SEEK TO AVOID AT PRESENT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE MORE PRUDENT TO ACT HEREIN
1724-395-0088 AND TO MAKE IT A HABIT TO PROMISE NOTHING EXCEPT WITH THE INTENTION OF KEEPING IT BUT IT IS SOON CLEAR TO ME THAT SUCH A MAXIM WILL STILL ONLY BE BASED ON THE FEAR OF CONSEQUENCES NOW
1724-395-0089 IT IS A WHOLLY DIFFERENT THING TO BE TRUTHFUL FROM DUTY AND TO BE SO FROM APPREHENSION OF INJURIOUS CONSEQUENCES IN THE FIRST CASE THE VERY NOTION OF THE ACTION
1724-395-0090 IN THE SECOND CASE I MUST FIRST LOOK ABOUT ELSEWHERE TO SEE WHAT RESULTS MAY BE COMBINED WITH IT WHICH WOULD AFFECT MYSELF FOR TO DEVIATE FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF DUTY IS BEYOND ALL DOUBT WICKED
1724-395-0091 BUT TO BE UNFAITHFUL TO MY MAXIM OF PRUDENCE MAY OFTEN BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUS TO ME ALTHOUGH TO ABIDE BY IT IS CERTAINLY SAFER THE SHORTEST WAY HOWEVER AND AN UNERRING ONE TO DISCOVER THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
1724-395-0092 WHETHER A LYING PROMISE IS CONSISTENT WITH DUTY IS TO ASK MYSELF SHOULD I BE CONTENT THAT MY MAXIM TO EXTRICATE MYSELF FROM DIFFICULTY BY A FALSE PROMISE SHOULD HOLD GOOD AS A UNIVERSAL LAW
1724-395-0093 THEN I PRESENTLY BECOME AWARE THAT WHILE I CAN WILL THE LIE I CAN BY NO MEANS WILL THAT LYING SHOULD BE A UNIVERSAL LAW FOR WITH SUCH A LAW THERE WOULD BE NO PROMISES AT ALL
1724-395-0094 HENCE MY MAXIM AS SOON AS IT SHOULD BE MADE A UNIVERSAL LAW WOULD NECESSARILY DESTROY ITSELF I DO NOT THEREFORE NEED ANY FAR REACHING PENETRATION TO DISCERN WHAT I HAVE TO DO
1724-395-0095 IN ORDER THAT MY WILL MAY BE MORALLY GOOD INEXPERIENCED IN THE COURSE OF THE WORLD INCAPABLE OF BEING PREPARED FOR ALL ITS CONTINGENCIES I ONLY ASK MYSELF
1724-395-0096 AND REASON EXTORTS FROM ME IMMEDIATE RESPECT FOR SUCH LEGISLATION I DO NOT INDEED AS YET DISCERN ON WHAT THIS RESPECT IS BASED THIS THE PHILOSOPHER MAY INQUIRE BUT AT LEAST I UNDERSTAND THIS
1724-395-0097 BECAUSE IT IS THE CONDITION OF A WILL BEING GOOD IN ITSELF AND THE WORTH OF SUCH A WILL IS ABOVE EVERYTHING THUS THEN WITHOUT QUITTING THE MORAL KNOWLEDGE OF COMMON HUMAN REASON WE HAVE ARRIVED AT ITS PRINCIPLE
1724-395-0098 WITH THIS COMPASS IN HAND MEN ARE WELL ABLE TO DISTINGUISH IN EVERY CASE THAT OCCURS WHAT IS GOOD WHAT BAD CONFORMABLY TO DUTY OR INCONSISTENT WITH IT IF WITHOUT IN THE LEAST TEACHING THEM ANYTHING NEW WE ONLY LIKE SOCRATES
1724-395-0099 DIRECT THEIR ATTENTION TO THE PRINCIPLE THEY THEMSELVES EMPLOY AND THAT THEREFORE WE DO NOT NEED SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY TO KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO BE HONEST AND GOOD YEA EVEN WISE AND VIRTUOUS INDEED
1724-395-0100 AND THEREFORE ALSO TO KNOW WOULD BE WITHIN THE REACH OF EVERY MAN EVEN THE COMMONEST HERE WE CANNOT FORBEAR ADMIRATION WHEN WE SEE HOW GREAT AN ADVANTAGE THE PRACTICAL JUDGEMENT HAS OVER THE THEORETICAL
1724-395-0101 IN THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF MEN IN THE LATTER IF COMMON REASON VENTURES TO DEPART FROM THE LAWS OF EXPERIENCE AND FROM THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE SENSES IT FALLS INTO MERE INCONCEIVABILITIES AND SELF CONTRADICTIONS
1724-395-0102 OBSCURITY AND INSTABILITY BUT IN THE PRACTICAL SPHERE IT IS JUST WHEN THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING EXCLUDES ALL SENSIBLE SPRINGS FROM PRACTICAL LAWS THAT ITS POWER OF JUDGEMENT BEGINS TO SHOW ITSELF TO ADVANTAGE
1724-395-0103 AND IN THE LATTER CASE IT MAY EVEN HAVE AS GOOD A HOPE OF HITTING THE MARK AS ANY PHILOSOPHER WHATEVER CAN PROMISE HIMSELF NAY IT IS ALMOST MORE SURE OF DOING SO BECAUSE THE PHILOSOPHER CANNOT HAVE ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE
1724-395-0104 WHILE HE MAY EASILY PERPLEX HIS JUDGEMENT BY A MULTITUDE OF CONSIDERATIONS FOREIGN TO THE MATTER AND SO TURN ASIDE FROM THE RIGHT WAY WOULD IT NOT THEREFORE BE WISER IN MORAL CONCERNS TO ACQUIESCE IN THE JUDGEMENT OF COMMON REASON
1724-395-0105 BUT NOT SO AS TO DRAW OFF THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING FROM ITS HAPPY SIMPLICITY OR TO BRING IT BY MEANS OF PHILOSOPHY INTO A NEW PATH OF INQUIRY AND INSTRUCTION INNOCENCE IS INDEED A GLORIOUS THING
1724-395-0106 ONLY ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS VERY SAD THAT IT CANNOT WELL MAINTAIN ITSELF AND IS EASILY SEDUCED ON THIS ACCOUNT EVEN WISDOM WHICH OTHERWISE CONSISTS MORE IN CONDUCT THAN IN KNOWLEDGE YET HAS NEED OF SCIENCE
1724-395-0107 AND AS IT WERE WITH DISREGARD AND CONTEMPT FOR THESE CLAIMS WHICH ARE SO IMPETUOUS AND AT THE SAME TIME SO PLAUSIBLE AND WHICH WILL NOT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE SUPPRESSED BY ANY COMMAND HENCE THERE ARISES A NATURAL DIALECTIC
1724-395-0108 DISPOSITION TO ARGUE AGAINST THESE STRICT LAWS OF DUTY AND TO QUESTION THEIR VALIDITY OR AT LEAST THEIR PURITY AND STRICTNESS AND IF POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM MORE ACCORDANT WITH OUR WISHES AND INCLINATIONS THAT IS TO SAY TO CORRUPT THEM AT THEIR VERY SOURCE
1724-395-0109 PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY NOT TO SATISFY ANY SPECULATIVE WANT WHICH NEVER OCCURS TO IT AS LONG AS IT IS CONTENT TO BE MERE SOUND REASON BUT EVEN ON PRACTICAL GROUNDS IN ORDER TO ATTAIN IN IT INFORMATION AND CLEAR INSTRUCTION
1724-395-0110 RESPECTING THE SOURCE OF ITS PRINCIPLE AND THE CORRECT DETERMINATION OF IT IN OPPOSITION TO THE MAXIMS WHICH ARE BASED ON WANTS AND INCLINATIONS SO THAT IT MAY ESCAPE FROM THE PERPLEXITY OF OPPOSITE CLAIMS
1724-395-0111 AND NOT RUN THE RISK OF LOSING ALL GENUINE MORAL PRINCIPLES THROUGH THE EQUIVOCATION INTO WHICH IT EASILY FALLS THUS WHEN PRACTICAL REASON CULTIVATES ITSELF THERE INSENSIBLY ARISES IN IT
1724-395-0112 WHICH FORCES IT TO SEEK AID IN PHILOSOPHY JUST AS HAPPENS TO IT IN ITS THEORETIC USE
