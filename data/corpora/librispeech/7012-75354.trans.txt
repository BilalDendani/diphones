7012-75354-0000 ONE THAT UNDOUBTEDLY HOLDS IN EARTHLY ECONOMY A NOT DISSIMILAR OBSERVATION IS MADE IN THE PROVERB POSSESSION IS NINE TENTHS OF THE LAW INDEED SOME TRIFLING ACQUISITION OFTEN GIVES AN ANIMAL
7012-75354-0001 AN INITIAL ADVANTAGE WHICH MAY EASILY ROLL UP AND INCREASE PRODIGIOUSLY BECOMING THE BASIS OF PROLONGED GOOD FORTUNE SOMETIMES THIS INITIAL ADVANTAGE IS A MATTER OF NATURAL STRUCTURE LIKE TALENT STRENGTH OR GOODNESS SOMETIMES AN ACCIDENTAL ACCRETION LIKE BREEDING
7012-75354-0002 INSTRUCTION OR WEALTH SUCH ADVANTAGES GROW BY THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY MAKE AND IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A MAN LAUNCHED INTO THE WORLD AT THE RIGHT MOMENT WITH THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT TO MOUNT EASILY FROM EMINENCE TO EMINENCE
7012-75354-0003 AND ACCOMPLISH VERY GREAT THINGS WITHOUT DOING MORE THAN GENIALLY FOLLOW HIS INSTINCTS AND RESPOND WITH ARDOUR LIKE AN ALEXANDER OR A SHAKESPEARE TO HIS OPPORTUNITIES A GREAT ENDOWMENT
7012-75354-0004 IT IS NO LOSS OF LIBERTY TO SUBORDINATE OURSELVES TO A NATURAL LEADER ON THE CONTRARY WE THEREBY SEIZE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXERCISE OUR FREEDOM AVAILING OURSELVES OF THE BEST INSTRUMENT OBTAINABLE TO ACCOMPLISH OUR ENDS
7012-75354-0005 A MAN MAY BE A NATURAL EITHER BY HIS CHARACTER OR BY HIS POSITION THE ADVANTAGES A MAN DRAWS FROM THAT PECULIAR STRUCTURE OF HIS BRAIN WHICH RENDERS HIM FOR INSTANCE A READY SPEAKER OR AN INGENIOUS MATHEMATICIAN
7012-75354-0006 ARE BY COMMON CONSENT REGARDED AS LEGITIMATE ADVANTAGES THE PUBLIC WILL USE AND REWARD SUCH ABILITY WITHOUT JEALOUSY AND WITH POSITIVE DELIGHT
7012-75354-0007 IN AN UNSOPHISTICATED AGE THE SAME FEELING PREVAILS IN REGARD TO THOSE ADVANTAGES WHICH A MAN MAY DRAW FROM MORE EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES IF A TRAVELLER HAVING BEEN SHIPWRECKED IN SOME EXPEDITION
7012-75354-0008 SHOULD LEARN THE SECRETS OF AN UNKNOWN LAND ITS ARTS AND RESOURCES HIS FELLOW CITIZENS ON HIS RETURN WOULD NOT HESITATE TO FOLLOW HIS DIRECTION IN RESPECT TO THOSE NOVEL MATTERS IT WOULD BE SENSELESS FOLLY ON THEIR PART TO BEGRUDGE HIM HIS ADVENTITIOUS EMINENCE
7012-75354-0009 AND REFUSE TO ESTEEM HIM OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN THEIR UNINITIATED SELVES YET WHEN PEOPLE IGNORING THE NATURAL CAUSES OF ALL THAT IS CALLED ARTIFICIAL THINK THAT BUT FOR AN UNLUCKY CHANCE THEY TOO MIGHT HAVE ENJOYED THE ADVANTAGES
7012-75354-0010 WHICH RAISE OTHER MEN ABOVE THEM THEY SOMETIMES AFFECT NOT TO RECOGNISE ACTUAL DISTINCTIONS AND ABILITIES OR STUDY ENVIOUSLY THE MEANS OF ANNULLING THEM
7012-75354-0011 SOME REAL COMPETENCE ACCRUES TO ANYONE IT IS FOR THE GENERAL INTEREST THAT THIS COMPETENCE SHOULD BEAR ITS NATURAL FRUITS DIVERSIFYING THE FACE OF SOCIETY
7012-75354-0012 VARIETY IN THE WORLD IS AN UNMIXED BLESSING SO LONG AS EACH DISTINCT FUNCTION CAN BE EXERCISED WITHOUT HINDRANCE TO ANY OTHER THERE IS NO GREATER STUPIDITY OR MEANNESS THAN TO TAKE UNIFORMITY FOR AN IDEAL AS IF IT WERE NOT A BENEFIT AND A JOY TO A MAN BEING WHAT HE IS
7012-75354-0013 TO KNOW THAT MANY ARE HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE BETTER THAN HE GRANT THAT NO ONE IS POSITIVELY DEGRADED BY THE GREAT MAN'S GREATNESS AND IT FOLLOWS THAT EVERYONE IS EXALTED BY IT BEAUTY GENIUS HOLINESS EVEN POWER AND EXTRAORDINARY WEALTH
7012-75354-0014 HENCE THE INSATIABLE VULGAR CURIOSITY ABOUT GREAT PEOPLE AND THE STRANGE WAY IN WHICH THE DESIRE FOR FAME BY WHICH THE DISTINGUISHED MAN SINKS TO THE COMMON LEVEL IS MET AND SATISFIED BY THE UNIVERSAL INTEREST IN WHATEVER IS EXTRAORDINARY THIS
7012-75354-0015 AVIDITY NOT TO MISS KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS NOTABLE AND TO ENACT VICARIOUSLY ALL SINGULAR ROLES SHOWS THE NEED MEN HAVE OF DISTINCTION AND THE ADVANTAGE THEY FIND EVEN IN CONCEIVING IT
7012-75354-0016 THAT RECOGNISES IN WHAT IS YET ATTAINED A SAD CARICATURE OF
7012-75354-0017 A DIFFERENCE WHICH RENDERS AGRIPPA'S FABLE WHOLLY MISLEADING THE HANDS AND FEET HAVE NO SEPARATE CONSCIOUSNESS AND IF THEY ARE ILL USED IT IS THE COMMON SELF THAT FEELS THE WEARINESS AND THE BRUISES
7012-75354-0018 BUT IN THE STATE THE VARIOUS MEMBERS HAVE A SEPARATE SENSIBILITY
7012-75354-0019 AND ALTHOUGH THEIR ULTIMATE INTERESTS LIE NO DOUBT IN CO OPERATION AND JUSTICE THEIR IMMEDIATE INSTINCT AND PASSION MAY LEAD THEM TO OPPRESS ONE ANOTHER PERPETUALLY AT ONE TIME THE BRAIN FORGETTING THE MEMBERS MAY FEAST ON OPIATES AND UNCEASING MUSIC AND AGAIN THE MEMBERS
7012-75354-0020 THINKING THEY COULD MORE ECONOMICALLY SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES MAY STARVE THE BRAIN AND REDUCE THE BODY POLITIC TO A COLONY OF VEGETATING MICROBES IN A WORD THE CONSCIOUSNESS INHABITING THE BRAIN
7012-75354-0021 BUT IN THE STATE EVERY CELL HAS A SEPARATE BRAIN AND THE GREATEST CITIZEN BY HIS EXISTENCE REALISES ONLY HIS OWN
7012-75354-0022 SINCE LUXURY AND INJUSTICE WE ARE TOLD FIRST NECESSITATED WAR AND THE GUIDING IDEA OF ALL THE PLATONIC REGIMEN IS MILITARY EFFICIENCY
7012-75354-0023 ON THE OTHER THE FINITE VALUES OF ALL THE CREATED HIERARCHY ACCORDING TO THEISTIC COSMOLOGY THERE WAS A METAPHYSICAL NECESSITY IF CREATURES WERE TO EXIST AT ALL THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN SOME MEASURE INFERIOR TO GODHEAD OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INDISTINGUISHABLE
7012-75354-0024 FROM THE GODHEAD ITSELF ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE CALLED THE IDENTITY OF INDISCERNIBLES WHICH DECLARES THAT TWO BEINGS EXACTLY ALIKE CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT COLLAPSING INTO AN UNDIVIDED UNIT THE PROPAGATION OF LIFE INVOLVED THEN
7012-75354-0025 DECLENSION FROM PURE VITALITY AND TO DIFFUSE BEING MEANT TO DILUTE IT WITH NOTHINGNESS THIS DECLENSION MIGHT TAKE PLACE IN INFINITE DEGREES EACH RETAINING SOME VESTIGE OF PERFECTION MIXED AS IT WERE
7012-75354-0026 AND INANIMATE CREATION EACH SPHERE AS IT RECEDED CONTAINED A PALER ADUMBRATION OF THE CENTRAL PERFECTION
7012-75354-0027 BUT ALSO NO EVIL TO THE CREATURE AND NO INJUSTICE FOR A MODICUM OF GOOD IS NOT MADE EVIL SIMPLY BECAUSE A GREATER GOOD IS ELSEWHERE POSSIBLE
7012-75354-0028 DANTE HAS EXPRESSED THIS THOUGHT WITH GREAT SIMPLICITY AND BEAUTY HE ASKS A FRIEND'S SPIRIT WHICH HE FINDS LODGED IN THE LOWEST CIRCLE OF PARADISE IF A DESIRE TO MOUNT HIGHER DOES NOT SOMETIMES VISIT HIM
7012-75354-0029 AND THE SPIRIT REPLIES BROTHER THE FORCE OF CHARITY QUIETS OUR WILL MAKING US WISH ONLY FOR WHAT WE HAVE AND THIRST FOR NOTHING MORE IF WE DESIRED TO BE IN A SUBLIMER SPHERE OUR DESIRES WOULD BE DISCORDANT WITH THE WILL OF HIM WHO HERE
7012-75354-0030 ALLOTS US OUR DIVERS STATIONS SOMETHING WHICH YOU WILL SEE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR IN THESE CIRCLES IF TO DWELL IN CHARITY BE NEEDFUL HERE AND IF YOU CONSIDER
7012-75354-0031 THAT OUR OWN PURPOSES MAY BECOME ONE ALSO THUS THE MANNER IN WHICH WE ARE RANGED FROM STEP TO STEP IN THIS KINGDOM PLEASES THE WHOLE KINGDOM AS IT DOES THE KING WHO GIVES US WILL TO WILL WITH HIM AND HIS WILL IS OUR PEACE IT IS THAT SEA TOWARD WHICH ALL THINGS MOVE
7012-75354-0032 THE ONLY PARADISE SUCH PIOUS RESIGNATION HAS IN IT SOMETHING PATHETIC AND CONSTRAINED
7012-75354-0033 FOR A THEISM WHICH LIKE ARISTOTLE'S AND DANTE'S HAS A PLATONIC ESSENCE GOD IS REALLY NOTHING BUT THE GOAL OF HUMAN ASPIRATION EMBODIED IMAGINATIVELY THIS FACT MAKES THESE PHILOSOPHERS FEEL THAT WHATEVER FALLS SHORT OF DIVINITY HAS SOMETHING IMPERFECT ABOUT IT
7012-75354-0034 MUST YEARN FOR EVER LIKE ARISTOTLE'S COSMOS MAKING IN HIS PERPETUAL ROUND A VAIN IMITATION OF DEITY AND AN ETERNAL PRAYER HENCE A LATENT MINOR STRAIN IN ARISTOTLE'S PHILOSOPHY THE HOPELESS NOTE OF PAGANISM AND IN DANTE AN UNDERTONE OF SORROW AND SACRIFICE
7012-75354-0035 INSEPARABLE FROM CHRISTIAN FEELING IN BOTH VIRTUE IMPLIES A CERTAIN SENSE OF DEFEAT A FATAL UNNATURAL LIMITATION AS IF A PRISTINE IDEAL HAD BEEN
7012-75354-0036 AND WHAT REMAINED WERE AT BEST A COMPROMISE ACCORDINGLY WE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED IF ASPIRATION IN ALL THESE MEN FINALLY TAKES A MYSTICAL TURN AND DANTE'S GHOSTLY FRIENDS AFTER PROPOUNDING THEIR ARISTOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY TO JUSTIFY GOD IN OTHER MEN'S EYES
7012-75354-0037 ARE THEMSELVES ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE LOWER SPHERE TO WHICH GOD HAD ASSIGNED THEM AND PLUNGING INTO THE SEA OF HIS ABSOLUTE ECSTASY
7012-75354-0038 HEAVEN CAN CONSIST ONLY IN APOTHEOSIS THIS THE GREEKS KNEW VERY WELL THEY INSTINCTIVELY IGNORED OR FEARED ANY IMMORTALITY WHICH FELL SHORT OF DEIFICATION AND THE CHRISTIAN MYSTICS REACHED THE SAME GOAL BY LESS OVERT COURSES
7012-75354-0039 THEY MERGED THE POPULAR IDEA OF A PERSONAL GOD IN THEIR FORETASTE OF PEACE AND PERFECTION
7012-75354-0040 PERFECTIONS DIFFER TOO IT IS TRUE THAT THE THEISTIC COSMOLOGY MIGHT HEAR A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION IF BY DEITY WE MEAN NOT MAN'S IDEAL INTELLECTUAL OR SENSUOUS BUT THE TOTAL COSMIC ORDER
7012-75354-0041 GOD OR THE HIGHEST BEING WOULD THEN BE SIMPLY THE LIFE OF NATURE AS A WHOLE IF NATURE HAS A CONSCIOUS LIFE OR THAT OF ITS NOBLEST PORTION THE SUPPOSED METAPHYSICAL EVIL INVOLVED IN FINITUDE WOULD THEN BE NO EVIL AT ALL
7012-75354-0042 BUT THE CONDITION OF EVERY GOOD IN REALISING HIS OWN WILL IN HIS OWN WAY EACH CREATURE WOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY WITHOUT YEARNING OR PATHETIC REGRETS FOR OTHER FORMS OF BEING SUCH FORMS OF BEING WOULD ALL BE UNPALATABLE TO HIM
7012-75354-0043 EVEN IF CONVENTIONALLY CALLED HIGHER BECAUSE THEIR BODY WAS LARGER AND THEIR SOUL MORE COMPLEX
7012-75354-0044 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INHABITANTS EVEN OF THE LOWEST HEAVEN
7012-75354-0045 AS HAPPY IN THEIR WAY AS THOSE OF THE SEVENTH HEAVEN COULD BE IN THEIRS NO PATHETIC NOTE WOULD ANY LONGER DISQUIET THEIR FINITUDE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO RENOUNCE IN SAD CONFORMITY TO AN ALIEN WILL
7012-75354-0046 PERSONS OF ONE RANK WOULD NOT BE IMPROVED BY PASSING INTO THE SO CALLED HIGHER SPHERE ANY MORE THAN THE OX WOULD BE IMPROVED BY BEING
7012-75354-0047 MAN IN SUCH A SYSTEM COULD NO MORE PINE TO BE GOD THAN HE COULD PINE TO BE THE LAW OF GRAVITY OR SPINOZA'S SUBSTANCE OR HEGEL'S DIALECTICAL IDEA
