6510-62516-0000 DID NOT CARE TO TROUBLE HIMSELF WITH WHAT PENCROFT WAS SAYING HERBERT SHARED IN SOME DEGREE THE SAILOR'S FEELINGS AS TO THE REPORTER HE SIMPLY REPLIED UPON MY WORD PENCROFT IT'S PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO ME
6510-62516-0001 THE ENGINEER WAS TO THEM A MICROCOSM A COMPOUND OF EVERY SCIENCE A POSSESSOR OF ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE IT WAS BETTER TO BE WITH CYRUS IN A DESERT ISLAND THAN WITHOUT HIM IN THE MOST FLOURISHING TOWN IN THE UNITED STATES
6510-62516-0002 WITH HIM THEY COULD WANT NOTHING WITH HIM THEY WOULD NEVER DESPAIR IF THESE BRAVE MEN HAD BEEN TOLD THAT A VOLCANIC ERUPTION WOULD DESTROY THE LAND THAT THIS LAND WOULD BE ENGULFED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE PACIFIC
6510-62516-0003 THEY WOULD HAVE IMPERTURBABLY REPLIED CYRUS IS HERE WHILE IN THE PALANQUIN HOWEVER THE ENGINEER HAD AGAIN RELAPSED INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS WHICH THE JOLTING TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED DURING HIS JOURNEY HAD BROUGHT ON
6510-62516-0004 SO THAT THEY COULD NOT NOW APPEAL TO HIS INGENUITY THE SUPPER MUST NECESSARILY BE VERY MEAGER IN FACT ALL THE GROUSE FLESH HAD BEEN CONSUMED AND THERE NO LONGER EXISTED ANY MEANS OF COOKING MORE GAME
6510-62516-0005 BESIDES THE COUROUCOUS WHICH HAD BEEN RESERVED HAD DISAPPEARED THEY MUST CONSIDER WHAT WAS TO BE DONE FIRST OF ALL CYRUS HARDING WAS CARRIED INTO THE CENTRAL PASSAGE THERE THEY MANAGED TO ARRANGE FOR HIM A COUCH OF SEA WEED
6510-62516-0006 WHICH STILL REMAINED ALMOST DRY THE DEEP SLEEP WHICH HAD OVERPOWERED HIM WOULD NO DOUBT BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO HIM THAN ANY NOURISHMENT NIGHT HAD CLOSED IN AND THE TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD MODIFIED WHEN THE WIND SHIFTED TO THE NORTHWEST
6510-62516-0007 AGAIN BECAME EXTREMELY COLD ALSO THE SEA HAVING DESTROYED THE PARTITIONS WHICH PENCROFT HAD PUT UP IN CERTAIN PLACES IN THE PASSAGES THE CHIMNEYS ON ACCOUNT OF THE DRAUGHTS HAD BECOME SCARCELY HABITABLE
6510-62516-0008 THE ENGINEER'S CONDITION WOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN BAD ENOUGH IF HIS COMPANIONS HAD NOT CAREFULLY COVERED HIM WITH THEIR COATS AND WAISTCOATS SUPPER THIS EVENING WAS OF COURSE COMPOSED OF THE INEVITABLE LITHODOMES
6510-62516-0009 IT IS USED IN PARTS OF THE EAST VERY CONSIDERABLY BY THE NATIVES NEVER MIND SAID THE SAILOR THE CAPTAIN WILL HELP US SOON MEANWHILE THE COLD BECAME VERY SEVERE AND UNHAPPILY
6510-62516-0010 THEY HAD NO MEANS OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES FROM IT THE SAILOR EXTREMELY VEXED TRIED IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO PROCURE FIRE
6510-62516-0011 AS THOSE WHICH ARE EMITTED FROM FLINT WHEN STRUCK IN THE SAME MANNER THE EXPERIMENT THEREFORE DID NOT SUCCEED PENCROFT ALTHOUGH HE HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCEEDING THEN TRIED RUBBING TWO PIECES OF DRY WOOD TOGETHER AS SAVAGES DO
6510-62516-0012 LET THEM SAY WHAT THEY WILL HE EXCLAIMED I COULD SOONER LIGHT MY ARMS BY RUBBING THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER THE SAILOR WAS WRONG TO DESPISE THE PROCEEDING SAVAGES OFTEN KINDLE WOOD BY MEANS OF RAPID RUBBING
6510-62516-0013 AND BESIDES THERE IS THE KNACK FOLLOWING THE USUAL EXPRESSION AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT PENCROFT HAD NOT THE KNACK PENCROFT'S ILL HUMOR DID NOT LAST LONG HERBERT HAD TAKEN THE BITS OF WOOD WHICH HE HAD TURNED DOWN
6510-62516-0014 AND WAS EXERTING HIMSELF TO RUB THEM THE HARDY SAILOR COULD NOT RESTRAIN A BURST OF LAUGHTER ON SEEING THE EFFORTS OF THE LAD TO SUCCEED WHERE HE HAD FAILED RUB MY BOY RUB SAID HE I AM RUBBING REPLIED HERBERT LAUGHING
6510-62516-0015 WHILE TOP SLEPT AT HIS MASTER'S FEET NEXT DAY THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MARCH WHEN THE ENGINEER AWOKE ABOUT EIGHT IN THE MORNING HE SAW HIS COMPANIONS AROUND HIM WATCHING HIS SLEEP AND AS ON THE DAY BEFORE HIS FIRST WORDS WERE
6510-62516-0016 ISLAND OR CONTINENT THIS WAS HIS UPPERMOST THOUGHT WELL REPLIED PENCROFT
6510-62516-0017 YOU DON'T KNOW YET BUT WE SHALL KNOW REJOINED PENCROFT WHEN YOU HAVE GUIDED US INTO THE COUNTRY I THINK I AM ABLE TO TRY IT REPLIED THE ENGINEER WHO WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT ROSE AND STOOD UPRIGHT THAT'S CAPITAL CRIED THE SAILOR
6510-62516-0018 I FEEL DREADFULLY WEAK REPLIED HARDING GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT MY FRIENDS AND IT WILL SOON GO OFF YOU HAVE FIRE HAVEN'T YOU THIS QUESTION WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY REPLIED TO BUT IN A FEW SECONDS
6510-62516-0019 ALAS WE HAVE NO FIRE SAID PENCROFT OR RATHER CAPTAIN WE HAVE IT NO LONGER AND THE SAILOR RECOUNTED ALL THAT HAD PASSED THE DAY BEFORE HE AMUSED THE ENGINEER BY THE HISTORY OF THE SINGLE MATCH
6510-62516-0020 THEN HIS ABORTIVE ATTEMPT TO PROCURE FIRE IN THE SAVAGES WAY WE SHALL CONSIDER REPLIED THE ENGINEER AND IF WE DO NOT FIND SOME SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO TINDER WELL ASKED THE SAILOR
6510-62516-0021 WELL WE WILL MAKE MATCHES CHEMICALS CHEMICALS IT IS NOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN THAT CRIED THE REPORTER STRIKING THE SAILOR ON THE SHOULDER THE LATTER DID NOT THINK IT SO SIMPLE BUT HE DID NOT PROTEST
6510-62516-0022 ALL WENT OUT THE WEATHER HAD BECOME VERY FINE THE SUN WAS RISING FROM THE SEA'S HORIZON AND TOUCHED WITH GOLDEN SPANGLES THE PRISMATIC RUGOSITIES OF THE HUGE PRECIPICE
6510-62516-0023 HAVING THROWN A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM THE ENGINEER SEATED HIMSELF ON A BLOCK OF STONE HERBERT OFFERED HIM A FEW HANDFULS OF SHELL FISH AND SARGASSUM SAYING
6510-62516-0024 THANKS MY BOY REPLIED HARDING IT WILL DO FOR THIS MORNING AT LEAST HE ATE THE WRETCHED FOOD WITH APPETITE AND WASHED IT DOWN WITH A LITTLE FRESH WATER DRAWN FROM THE RIVER IN AN IMMENSE SHELL
6510-62516-0025 HIS COMPANIONS LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING THEN FEELING SOMEWHAT REFRESHED CYRUS HARDING CROSSED HIS ARMS AND SAID SO MY FRIENDS YOU DO NOT KNOW YET WHETHER FATE HAS THROWN US ON AN ISLAND OR ON A CONTINENT
6510-62516-0026 NO CAPTAIN REPLIED THE BOY WE SHALL KNOW TO MORROW SAID THE ENGINEER TILL THEN THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE YES REPLIED PENCROFT WHAT FIRE SAID THE SAILOR WHO ALSO HAD A FIXED IDEA
6510-62516-0027 TO THE SUMMIT TO MORROW AND THEN WE SHALL SEE IF THIS LAND IS AN ISLAND OR A CONTINENT TILL THEN I REPEAT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE YES FIRE SAID THE OBSTINATE SAILOR AGAIN
6510-62516-0028 BUT HE WILL MAKE US A FIRE REPLIED GIDEON SPILETT ONLY HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE PENCROFT THE SEAMAN LOOKED AT SPILETT IN A WAY WHICH SEEMED TO SAY IF IT DEPENDED UPON YOU TO DO IT WE WOULDN'T TASTE ROAST MEAT VERY SOON BUT HE WAS SILENT
6510-62516-0029 MEANWHILE CAPTAIN HARDING HAD MADE NO REPLY HE APPEARED TO BE VERY LITTLE TROUBLED BY THE QUESTION OF FIRE FOR A FEW MINUTES HE REMAINED ABSORBED IN THOUGHT THEN AGAIN SPEAKING MY FRIENDS SAID HE
6510-62516-0030 OUR SITUATION IS PERHAPS DEPLORABLE BUT AT ANY RATE IT IS VERY PLAIN EITHER WE ARE ON A CONTINENT AND THEN AT THE EXPENSE OF GREATER OR LESS FATIGUE WE SHALL REACH SOME INHABITED PLACE OR
6510-62516-0031 WE ARE ON AN ISLAND IN THE LATTER CASE
6510-62516-0032 ASKED GIDEON SPILETT WHEREABOUTS DO YOU THINK CYRUS THIS STORM HAS THROWN US I CANNOT SAY EXACTLY REPLIED THE ENGINEER BUT I PRESUME IT IS SOME LAND IN THE PACIFIC IN FACT WHEN WE LEFT RICHMOND THE WIND WAS BLOWING FROM THE NORTHEAST
6510-62516-0033 THE GULF OF MEXICO MEXICO ITSELF IN ITS NARROW PART THEN A PART OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN I CANNOT ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE TRAVERSED BY THE BALLOON AT LESS THAN SIX TO SEVEN THOUSAND MILES
6510-62516-0034 WE SHALL NOT KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO RELY ON UNTIL WE HAVE FIRST MADE THE ASCENT OF THE MOUNTAIN REPLIED THE ENGINEER BUT TO MORROW CAPTAIN ASKED HERBERT SHALL YOU BE IN A STATE TO BEAR THE FATIGUE OF THE ASCENT I HOPE SO REPLIED THE ENGINEER
6510-62516-0035 PROVIDED YOU AND PENCROFT MY BOY SHOW YOURSELVES QUICK AND CLEVER HUNTERS CAPTAIN SAID THE SAILOR SINCE YOU ARE SPEAKING OF GAME IF ON MY RETURN I WAS AS CERTAIN OF ROASTING IT AS I AM OF BRINGING IT BACK
6510-62516-0036 BRING IT BACK ALL THE SAME PENCROFT REPLIED HARDING IT WAS THEN AGREED THAT THE ENGINEER AND THE REPORTER WERE TO PASS THE DAY AT THE CHIMNEYS SO AS TO EXAMINE THE SHORE AND THE UPPER PLATEAU
6510-62516-0037 WERE TO RETURN TO THE FOREST RENEW THEIR STORE OF WOOD AND LAY VIOLENT HANDS ON EVERY CREATURE FEATHERED OR HAIRY WHICH MIGHT COME WITHIN THEIR REACH THEY SET OUT ACCORDINGLY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
6510-62516-0038 PENCROFT MURMURING ASIDE IF ON MY RETURN I FIND A FIRE AT THE HOUSE I SHALL BELIEVE THAT THE THUNDER ITSELF CAME TO LIGHT IT ALL THREE CLIMBED THE BANK AND ARRIVED AT THE ANGLE MADE BY THE RIVER THE SAILOR STOPPING
6510-62516-0039 WE CAN COME BACK AND COLLECT OUR WOOD THIS AGREED TO
6510-62516-0040 AFTER HAVING TORN THREE STICKS FROM THE TRUNK OF A YOUNG FIR FOLLOWED TOP WHO WAS BOUNDING ABOUT AMONG THE LONG GRASS THIS TIME THE HUNTERS INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE COURSE OF THE RIVER PLUNGED STRAIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE FOREST
6510-62516-0041 BELONGING FOR THE MOST PART TO THE PINE FAMILY IN CERTAIN PLACES LESS CROWDED GROWING IN CLUMPS THESE PINES EXHIBITED CONSIDERABLE DIMENSIONS AND APPEARED TO INDICATE BY THEIR DEVELOPMENT
6510-62516-0042 THAT THE COUNTRY WAS SITUATED IN A HIGHER LATITUDE THAN THE ENGINEER HAD SUPPOSED GLADES BRISTLING WITH STUMPS WORN AWAY BY TIME WERE COVERED WITH DRY WOOD WHICH FORMED AN INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF FUEL THEN
6510-62516-0043 THE GLADE PASSED THE UNDERWOOD THICKENED AGAIN AND BECAME ALMOST IMPENETRABLE IT WAS DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO FIND THE WAY AMONG THE GROUPS OF TREES WITHOUT ANY BEATEN TRACK SO THE SAILOR FROM TIME TO TIME
6510-62516-0044 RUNNING UNDER THE BRANCHES ONLY ROUSED BIRDS WHICH COULD NOT BE APPROACHED EVEN THE COUROUCOUS WERE INVISIBLE AND IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THE SAILOR WOULD BE OBLIGED TO RETURN TO THE MARSHY PART OF THE FOREST
6510-62516-0045 IN WHICH HE HAD SO HAPPILY PERFORMED HIS GROUSE FISHING
6510-62516-0046 IF THIS IS ALL THE GAME WHICH YOU PROMISED TO BRING BACK TO MY MASTER IT WON'T NEED A LARGE FIRE TO ROAST IT HAVE PATIENCE REPLIED THE SAILOR IT ISN'T THE GAME WHICH WILL BE WANTING ON OUR RETURN HAVE YOU NOT CONFIDENCE IN CAPTAIN HARDING
6510-62516-0047 MEANWHILE THE SUN HAD NOT REACHED THE HIGHEST POINT IN ITS COURSE ABOVE THE HORIZON THE EXPLORATION THEREFORE CONTINUED AND WAS USEFULLY MARKED BY A DISCOVERY WHICH HERBERT MADE OF A TREE WHOSE FRUIT WAS EDIBLE
6510-62516-0048 THIS WAS THE STONE PINE WHICH PRODUCES AN EXCELLENT ALMOND VERY MUCH ESTEEMED IN THE TEMPERATE REGIONS OF AMERICA AND EUROPE
6510-62516-0049 AND HERBERT DESCRIBED THEM TO HIS COMPANIONS WHO FEASTED ON THEM COME SAID PENCROFT SEA WEED BY WAY OF BREAD RAW MUSSELS FOR MEAT AND ALMONDS FOR DESSERT THAT'S CERTAINLY A GOOD DINNER FOR THOSE
6510-62516-0050 BARKING WITH TOP'S BARKING WERE MINGLED CURIOUS GRUNTINGS
6510-62516-0051 BUT RATHER HOW THEY WERE TO GET HOLD OF IT THE HUNTERS HAD SCARCELY ENTERED THE BUSHES WHEN THEY SAW TOP ENGAGED IN A STRUGGLE WITH AN ANIMAL WHICH HE WAS HOLDING BY THE EAR
6510-62516-0052 NEARLY TWO FEET AND A HALF LONG
6510-62516-0053 WAS JUST GOING TO FELL THE PIG WHEN THE LATTER TEARING ITSELF FROM TOP'S TEETH BY WHICH IT WAS ONLY HELD BY THE TIP OF ITS EAR UTTERED A VIGOROUS GRUNT RUSHED UPON HERBERT ALMOST OVERTHREW HIM AND DISAPPEARED IN THE WOOD
6510-62516-0054 THE RASCAL CRIED PENCROFT ALL THREE DIRECTLY DARTED AFTER TOP BUT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY JOINED HIM THE ANIMAL HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WATERS OF A LARGE POND SHADED BY VENERABLE PINES
6510-62516-0055 MOTIONLESS TOP PLUNGED INTO THE WATER BUT THE CAPYBARA HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POND DID NOT APPEAR LET US WAIT SAID THE BOY FOR HE WILL SOON COME TO THE SURFACE TO BREATHE WON'T HE DROWN
6510-62516-0056 WHICH THE DOG WAS LOOKING FOR BENEATH THE WATER HERBERT WAS NOT MISTAKEN IN A FEW MINUTES THE ANIMAL APPEARED ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER TOP WAS UPON IT IN A BOUND AND KEPT IT FROM PLUNGING AGAIN AN INSTANT LATER THE CAPYBARA DRAGGED TO THE BANK
6510-62516-0057 WAS KILLED BY A BLOW FROM NEB'S STICK
6510-62516-0058 WHO WAS ALWAYS READY WITH THIS CRY OF TRIUMPH GIVE ME BUT A GOOD FIRE AND THIS PIG SHALL BE GNAWED TO THE BONES
6510-62516-0059 AND JUDGING BY THE HEIGHT OF THE SUN THAT IT WAS ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK HE GAVE THE SIGNAL TO RETURN TOP'S INSTINCT WAS USEFUL TO THE HUNTERS WHO THANKS TO THE INTELLIGENT ANIMAL WERE ENABLED TO DISCOVER THE ROAD BY WHICH THEY HAD COME
6510-62516-0060 HALF AN HOUR LATER THEY ARRIVED AT THE RIVER PENCROFT SOON MADE A RAFT OF WOOD AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH IF THERE WAS NO FIRE IT WOULD BE A USELESS TASK AND THE RAFT FOLLOWING THE CURRENT THEY RETURNED TOWARDS THE CHIMNEYS
