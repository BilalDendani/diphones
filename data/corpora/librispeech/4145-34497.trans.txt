4145-34497-0000 IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK ALREADY AND SO IN ORDER TO BE THERE QUICKLY AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT TO DRIVE WITH HIS OWN HORSES KNOWN TO EVERYONE VRONSKY GOT INTO YASHVIN'S HIRED FLY AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO DRIVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
4145-34497-0001 IT WAS A ROOMY OLD FASHIONED FLY WITH SEATS FOR FOUR HE SAT IN ONE CORNER STRETCHED HIS LEGS OUT ON THE FRONT SEAT AND SANK INTO MEDITATION A VAGUE SENSE OF THE ORDER INTO WHICH HIS AFFAIRS HAD BEEN BROUGHT
4145-34497-0002 A VAGUE RECOLLECTION OF THE FRIENDLINESS AND FLATTERY OF SERPUHOVSKOY WHO HAD CONSIDERED HIM A MAN THAT WAS NEEDED AND MOST OF ALL THE ANTICIPATION OF THE INTERVIEW BEFORE HIM ALL BLENDED INTO A GENERAL JOYOUS SENSE OF LIFE
4145-34497-0003 THIS FEELING WAS SO STRONG THAT HE COULD NOT HELP SMILING HE DROPPED HIS LEGS CROSSED ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER KNEE AND TAKING IT IN HIS HAND FELT THE SPRINGY MUSCLE OF THE CALF WHERE IT HAD BEEN GRAZED THE DAY BEFORE BY HIS FALL AND LEANING BACK HE DREW SEVERAL DEEP BREATHS
4145-34497-0004 I'M HAPPY VERY HAPPY HE SAID TO HIMSELF HE HAD OFTEN BEFORE HAD THIS SENSE OF PHYSICAL JOY IN HIS OWN BODY BUT HE HAD NEVER FELT SO FOND OF HIMSELF OF HIS OWN BODY AS AT THAT MOMENT HE ENJOYED THE SLIGHT ACHE IN HIS STRONG LEG
4145-34497-0005 THE SCENT OF BRILLIANTINE ON HIS WHISKERS STRUCK HIM AS PARTICULARLY PLEASANT IN THE FRESH AIR EVERYTHING HE SAW FROM THE CARRIAGE WINDOW EVERYTHING IN THAT COLD PURE AIR IN THE PALE LIGHT OF THE SUNSET
4145-34497-0006 WAS AS FRESH AND GAY AND STRONG AS HE WAS HIMSELF THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES SHINING IN THE RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN THE SHARP OUTLINES OF FENCES AND ANGLES OF BUILDINGS THE FIGURES OF PASSERS BY THE CARRIAGES THAT MET HIM NOW AND THEN
4145-34497-0007 THE MOTIONLESS GREEN OF THE TREES AND GRASS THE FIELDS WITH EVENLY DRAWN FURROWS OF POTATOES AND THE SLANTING SHADOWS THAT FELL FROM THE HOUSES AND TREES AND BUSHES AND EVEN FROM THE ROWS OF POTATOES
4145-34497-0008 EVERYTHING WAS BRIGHT LIKE A PRETTY LANDSCAPE JUST FINISHED AND FRESHLY VARNISHED GET ON GET ON HE SAID TO THE DRIVER PUTTING HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND PULLING A THREE ROUBLE NOTE OUT OF HIS POCKET HE HANDED IT TO THE MAN AS HE LOOKED ROUND
4145-34497-0009 THE DRIVER'S HAND FUMBLED WITH SOMETHING AT THE LAMP THE WHIP CRACKED AND THE CARRIAGE ROLLED RAPIDLY ALONG THE SMOOTH HIGHROAD I WANT NOTHING NOTHING BUT THIS HAPPINESS HE THOUGHT
4145-34497-0010 STARING AT THE BONE BUTTON OF THE BELL IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS AND PICTURING TO HIMSELF ANNA JUST AS HE HAD SEEN HER LAST TIME AND AS I GO ON I LOVE HER MORE AND MORE HERE'S THE GARDEN OF THE VREDE VILLA
4145-34497-0011 WHEREABOUTS WILL SHE BE WHERE HOW WHY DID SHE FIX ON THIS PLACE TO MEET ME AND WHY DOES SHE WRITE IN BETSY'S LETTER HE THOUGHT WONDERING NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME AT IT BUT THERE WAS NOW NO TIME FOR WONDER
4145-34497-0012 HE CALLED TO THE DRIVER TO STOP BEFORE REACHING THE AVENUE AND OPENING THE DOOR JUMPED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE AS IT WAS MOVING AND WENT INTO THE AVENUE THAT LED UP TO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE AVENUE
4145-34497-0013 YOU'RE NOT ANGRY THAT I SENT FOR YOU I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO SEE YOU SHE SAID AND THE SERIOUS AND SET LINE OF HER LIPS WHICH HE SAW UNDER THE VEIL TRANSFORMED HIS MOOD AT ONCE I ANGRY BUT HOW HAVE YOU COME WHERE FROM
4145-34497-0014 NEVER MIND SHE SAID LAYING HER HAND ON HIS COME ALONG I MUST TALK TO YOU HE SAW THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED AND THAT THE INTERVIEW WOULD NOT BE A JOYOUS ONE IN HER PRESENCE HE HAD NO WILL OF HIS OWN
4145-34497-0015 WITHOUT KNOWING THE GROUNDS OF HER DISTRESS HE ALREADY FELT THE SAME DISTRESS UNCONSCIOUSLY PASSING OVER HIM WHAT IS IT WHAT HE ASKED HER SQUEEZING HER HAND WITH HIS ELBOW AND TRYING TO READ HER THOUGHTS IN HER FACE
4145-34497-0016 SHE WALKED ON A FEW STEPS IN SILENCE GATHERING UP HER COURAGE THEN SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED I DID NOT TELL YOU YESTERDAY SHE BEGAN BREATHING QUICKLY AND PAINFULLY THAT COMING HOME WITH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING
4145-34497-0017 THAT AND TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HE HEARD HER UNCONSCIOUSLY BENDING HIS WHOLE FIGURE DOWN TO HER AS THOUGH HOPING IN THIS WAY TO SOFTEN THE HARDNESS OF HER POSITION FOR HER BUT DIRECTLY SHE HAD SAID THIS HE SUDDENLY DREW HIMSELF UP
4145-34497-0018 AND A PROUD AND HARD EXPRESSION CAME OVER HIS FACE YES YES THAT'S BETTER A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER I KNOW HOW PAINFUL IT WAS HE SAID BUT SHE WAS NOT LISTENING TO HIS WORDS SHE WAS READING HIS THOUGHTS FROM THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE
4145-34497-0019 SHE COULD NOT GUESS THAT THAT EXPRESSION AROSE FROM THE FIRST IDEA THAT PRESENTED ITSELF TO VRONSKY THAT A DUEL WAS NOW INEVITABLE THE IDEA OF A DUEL HAD NEVER CROSSED HER MIND AND SO SHE PUT A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION ON THIS PASSING EXPRESSION OF HARDNESS
4145-34497-0020 WHEN SHE GOT HER HUSBAND'S LETTER SHE KNEW THEN AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART THAT EVERYTHING WOULD GO ON IN THE OLD WAY THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH OF WILL TO FOREGO HER POSITION TO ABANDON HER SON AND TO JOIN HER LOVER
4145-34497-0021 THE MORNING SPENT AT PRINCESS TVERSKAYA'S HAD CONFIRMED HER STILL MORE IN THIS BUT THIS INTERVIEW WAS STILL OF THE UTMOST GRAVITY FOR HER SHE HOPED THAT THIS INTERVIEW WOULD TRANSFORM HER POSITION AND SAVE HER
4145-34497-0022 IF ON HEARING THIS NEWS HE WERE TO SAY TO HER RESOLUTELY PASSIONATELY WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S WAVERING THROW UP EVERYTHING AND COME WITH ME SHE WOULD GIVE UP HER SON AND GO AWAY WITH HIM BUT THIS NEWS HAD NOT PRODUCED WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED IN HIM
4145-34497-0023 HE SIMPLY SEEMED AS THOUGH HE WERE RESENTING SOME AFFRONT IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST PAINFUL TO ME IT HAPPENED OF ITSELF SHE SAID IRRITABLY AND SEE SHE PULLED HER HUSBAND'S LETTER OUT OF HER GLOVE
4145-34497-0024 I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND HE INTERRUPTED HER TAKING THE LETTER BUT NOT READING IT AND TRYING TO SOOTHE HER THE ONE THING I LONGED FOR THE ONE THING I PRAYED FOR WAS TO CUT SHORT THIS POSITION SO AS TO DEVOTE MY LIFE TO YOUR HAPPINESS
4145-34497-0025 DO YOU SUPPOSE I CAN DOUBT IT IF I DOUBTED WHO'S THAT COMING SAID VRONSKY SUDDENLY POINTING TO TWO LADIES WALKING TOWARDS THEM PERHAPS THEY KNOW US AND HE HURRIEDLY TURNED OFF DRAWING HER AFTER HIM INTO A SIDE PATH
4145-34497-0026 OH I DON'T CARE SHE SAID HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING AND HE FANCIED THAT HER EYES LOOKED WITH STRANGE FURY AT HIM FROM UNDER THE VEIL I TELL YOU THAT'S NOT THE POINT I CAN'T DOUBT THAT BUT SEE WHAT HE WRITES TO ME READ IT
4145-34497-0027 NOW WHILE HE HELD HIS LETTER IN HIS HANDS HE COULD NOT HELP PICTURING THE CHALLENGE WHICH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY FIND AT HOME TODAY OR TOMORROW AND THE DUEL ITSELF IN WHICH WITH THE SAME COLD AND HAUGHTY EXPRESSION THAT HIS FACE WAS ASSUMING AT THIS MOMENT
4145-34497-0028 HE WOULD AWAIT THE INJURED HUSBAND'S SHOT AFTER HAVING HIMSELF FIRED INTO THE AIR AND AT THAT INSTANT THERE FLASHED ACROSS HIS MIND THE THOUGHT OF WHAT SERPUHOVSKOY HAD JUST SAID TO HIM AND WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF BEEN THINKING IN THE MORNING
4145-34497-0029 THAT IT WAS BETTER NOT TO BIND HIMSELF AND HE KNEW THAT THIS THOUGHT HE COULD NOT TELL HER HAVING READ THE LETTER HE RAISED HIS EYES TO HER AND THERE WAS NO DETERMINATION IN THEM SHE SAW AT ONCE THAT HE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT BEFORE BY HIMSELF
4145-34497-0030 SHE KNEW THAT WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO HER HE WOULD NOT SAY ALL HE THOUGHT AND SHE KNEW THAT HER LAST HOPE HAD FAILED HER THIS WAS NOT WHAT SHE HAD BEEN RECKONING ON YOU SEE THE SORT OF MAN HE IS SHE SAID WITH A SHAKING VOICE HE
4145-34497-0031 FORGIVE ME BUT I REJOICE AT IT VRONSKY INTERRUPTED FOR GOD'S SAKE LET ME FINISH HE ADDED HIS EYES IMPLORING HER TO GIVE HIM TIME TO EXPLAIN HIS WORDS
4145-34497-0032 INEVITABLE HE THOUGHT THINGS COULD NOT GO ON AS BEFORE BUT HE SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT CAN'T GO ON I HOPE THAT NOW YOU WILL LEAVE HIM I HOPE HE WAS CONFUSED AND REDDENED THAT YOU WILL LET ME ARRANGE AND PLAN OUR LIFE
4145-34497-0033 TOMORROW HE WAS BEGINNING SHE DID NOT LET HIM GO ON BUT MY CHILD SHE SHRIEKED YOU SEE WHAT HE WRITES I SHOULD HAVE TO LEAVE HIM AND I CAN'T AND WON'T DO THAT BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE WHICH IS BETTER LEAVE YOUR CHILD
4145-34497-0034 OR KEEP UP THIS DEGRADING POSITION TO WHOM IS IT DEGRADING TO ALL AND MOST OF ALL TO YOU YOU SAY DEGRADING DON'T SAY THAT THOSE WORDS HAVE NO MEANING FOR ME SHE SAID IN A SHAKING VOICE
4145-34497-0035 SHE DID NOT WANT HIM NOW TO SAY WHAT WAS UNTRUE SHE HAD NOTHING LEFT HER BUT HIS LOVE AND SHE WANTED TO LOVE HIM DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE DAY I LOVED YOU EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED FOR ME
4145-34497-0036 PROUD SHE COULD NOT SAY WHAT SHE WAS PROUD OF TEARS OF SHAME AND DESPAIR CHOKED HER UTTERANCE SHE STOOD STILL AND SOBBED HE FELT TOO SOMETHING SWELLING IN HIS THROAT AND TWITCHING IN HIS NOSE
4145-34497-0037 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE FELT ON THE POINT OF WEEPING HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS TOUCHED HIM SO HE FELT SORRY FOR HER AND HE FELT HE COULD NOT HELP HER AND WITH THAT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS TO BLAME FOR HER WRETCHEDNESS
4145-34497-0038 AND THAT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG IS NOT A DIVORCE POSSIBLE HE SAID FEEBLY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOT ANSWERING COULDN'T YOU TAKE YOUR SON AND STILL LEAVE HIM YES BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HIM
4145-34497-0039 NOW I MUST GO TO HIM SHE SAID SHORTLY HER PRESENTIMENT THAT ALL WOULD AGAIN GO ON IN THE OLD WAY HAD NOT DECEIVED HER ON TUESDAY I SHALL BE IN PETERSBURG AND EVERYTHING CAN BE SETTLED YES SHE SAID BUT DON'T LET US TALK ANY MORE OF IT
