7445-94522-0000 AND THE GREAT CHANGE FROM A SOVEREIGN OF CONSUMMATE WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE TO A BOY OF ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY FELT BY THE PEOPLE
7445-94522-0001 THE HABITS OF ORDER AND OBEDIENCE WHICH THE BARONS HAD BEEN TAUGHT DURING THE LONG REIGN OF EDWARD STILL INFLUENCED THEM AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE KING'S THREE UNCLES THE DUKES OF LANCASTER YORK AND GLOCESTER SUFFICED TO REPRESS FOR A TIME
7445-94522-0002 THE TURBULENT SPIRIT TO WHICH THAT ORDER IN A WEAK REIGN WAS SO OFTEN SUBJECT THE DANGEROUS AMBITION TOO OF THESE PRINCES THEMSELVES WAS CHECKED BY THE PLAIN AND UNDENIABLE TITLE OF RICHARD BY THE DECLARATION OF IT MADE IN PARLIAMENT
7445-94522-0003 AND BY THE AFFECTIONATE REGARD WHICH THE PEOPLE BORE TO THE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER AND WHICH WAS NATURALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE YOUNG SOVEREIGN UPON THE THRONE THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS ALSO OF THESE THREE PRINCES RENDERED THEM A COUNTERPOISE TO EACH OTHER
7445-94522-0004 OR GIVE ANY IMMEDIATE APPREHENSIONS TO THE LOVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY BUT AS EDWARD THOUGH HE HAD FIXED THE SUCCESSION TO THE CROWN HAD TAKEN NO CARE TO ESTABLISH A PLAN OF GOVERNMENT DURING THE MINORITY OF HIS GRANDSON
7445-94522-0005 NATURALLY RECEIVED AN ACCESSION OF POWER DURING THE MINORITY AND AS IT WAS NOW BECOMING A SCENE OF BUSINESS THE MEMBERS CHOSE FOR THE FIRST TIME A SPEAKER WHO MIGHT PRESERVE ORDER IN THEIR DEBATES AND MAINTAIN THOSE FORMS WHICH ARE REQUISITE IN ALL NUMEROUS ASSEMBLES
7445-94522-0006 PETER DE LA MARE WAS THE MAN PITCHED ON THE SAME PERSON THAT HAD BEEN IMPRISONED AND DETAINED IN CUSTODY BY THE LATE KING FOR HIS FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN ATTACKING THE MISTRESS AND THE MINISTERS OF THAT PRINCE
7445-94522-0007 BUT THOUGH THIS ELECTION DISCOVERED A SPIRIT OF LIBERTY IN THE COMMONS AND WAS FOLLOWED BY FURTHER ATTACKS BOTH ON THESE MINISTERS AND ON ALICE PEARCE THEY WERE STILL TOO SENSIBLE OF THEIR GREAT INFERIORITY TO ASSUME AT FIRST ANY IMMEDIATE SHARE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT
7445-94522-0008 OR THE CARE OF THE KING'S PERSON THEY WERE CONTENT TO APPLY BY PETITION TO THE LORDS FOR THAT PURPOSE AND DESIRE THEM BOTH TO APPOINT A COUNCIL OF NINE WHO MIGHT DIRECT THE PUBLIC BUSINESS
7445-94522-0009 THE LORDS COMPLIED WITH THE FIRST PART OF THIS REQUEST AND ELECTED THE BISHOPS OF LONDON CARLISLE AND SALISBURY
7445-94522-0010 BUT ANOTHER PART OF THEIR APPLICATION THAT ALL THE GREAT OFFICERS SHOULD DURING THE KING'S MINORITY BE APPOINTED BY PARLIAMENT WHICH SEEMED TO REQUIRE THE CONCURRENCE OF THE COMMONS AS WELL AS THAT OF THE UPPER HOUSE IN THE NOMINATION WAS NOT COMPLIED WITH
7445-94522-0011 OF INTERPOSING IN THESE MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS OF STATE ON THIS FOOTING THEN THE GOVERNMENT STOOD THE ADMINISTRATION WAS CONDUCTED ENTIRELY IN THE KING'S NAME NO REGENCY WAS EXPRESSLY APPOINTED
7445-94522-0012 SCOTLAND WHOSE THRONE WAS NOW FILLED BY ROBERT STUART NEPHEW TO DAVID BRUCE AND THE FIRST PRINCE OF THAT FAMILY MAINTAINED SUCH CLOSE CONNECTIONS WITH FRANCE THAT WAR WITH ONE CROWN ALMOST INEVITABLY PRODUCED HOSTILITIES WITH THE OTHER
7445-94522-0013 AND SCRUPLED NOT WITH HIS SMALL ARMY TO ENTER INTO THE HEART OF FRANCE AND TO CONTINUE HIS RAVAGES THROUGH PICARDY CHAMPAIGNE THE BRIE
7445-94522-0014 THE GATINOIS THE ORLEANOIS TILL HE REACHED HIS ALLIES IN THE PROVINCE OF BRITTANY THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY AT THE HEAD OF A MORE CONSIDERABLE ARMY CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF HIM
7445-94522-0015 TO IMPOSE A NEW AND UNUSUAL TAX OF THREE GROATS ON EVERY PERSON MALE AND FEMALE ABOVE FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND THEY ORDAINED THAT IN LEVYING THAT TAX THE OPULENT SHOULD RELIEVE THE POOR BY AN EQUITABLE COMPENSATION
7445-94522-0016 THIS IMPOSITION PRODUCED A MUTINY WHICH WAS SINGULAR IN ITS CIRCUMSTANCES ALL HISTORY ABOUNDS WITH EXAMPLES WHERE THE GREAT TYRANNIZE OVER THE MEANER SORT
7445-94522-0017 WERE THE NATURAL EFFECTS OF THIS GROWING SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE REPORT OF THESE EVENTS BEING BROUGHT INTO ENGLAND WHERE PERSONAL SLAVERY AS WE LEARN FROM FROISSARD WAS MORE GENERAL THAN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN EUROPE
7445-94522-0018 THEIR EQUAL RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND TO ALL THE GOODS OF NATURE THE TYRANNY OF ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTIONS
7445-94522-0019 HAD DOUBTLESS OCCASIONED MANY PARTIALITIES AND MADE THE PEOPLE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE UNEQUAL LOT WHICH FORTUNE HAD ASSIGNED THEM IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF HER FAVORS THE FIRST DISORDER WAS RAISED BY A BLACKSMITH IN A VILLAGE OF ESSEX
7445-94522-0020 THE TAX GATHERERS CAME TO THIS MAN'S SHOP WHILE HE WAS AT WORK AND THEY DEMANDED PAYMENT FOR HIS DAUGHTER WHOM HE ASSERTED TO BE BELOW THE AGE ASSIGNED BY THE STATUTE ONE OF THESE FELLOWS OFFERED TO PRODUCE A VERY INDECENT PROOF TO THE CONTRARY
7445-94522-0021 AND AT THE SAME TIME LAID HOLD OF THE MAID WHICH THE FATHER RESENTING IMMEDIATELY KNOCKED OUT THE RUFFIAN'S BRAINS WITH HIS HAMMER
7445-94522-0022 THEY IMMEDIATELY FLEW TO ARMS THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD JOINED IN THE SEDITION
7445-94522-0023 IT SOON PROPAGATED ITSELF INTO THAT OF KENT OF HERTFORD SURREY SUSSEX SUFFOLK NORFOLK CAMBRIDGE AND LINCOLN BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT HAD THE LEAST WARNING OF THE DANGER THE DISORDER HAD GROWN BEYOND CONTROL OR OPPOSITION
7445-94522-0024 THE POPULACE HAD SHAKEN OFF ALL REGARD TO THEIR FORMER MASTERS AND BEING HEADED BY THE MOST AUDACIOUS AND CRIMINAL OF THEIR ASSOCIATES WHO ASSUMED THE FEIGNED NAMES OF WAT TYLER JACK STRAW HOB CARTER AND TOM MILLER
7445-94522-0025 BY WHICH THEY WERE FOND OF DENOTING THEIR MEAN ORIGIN THEY COMMITTED EVERY WHERE THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS VIOLENCE ON SUCH OF THE GENTRY OR NOBILITY AS HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FALL INTO THEIR HANDS
7445-94522-0026 THEY INSULTED HER ATTENDANTS AND SOME OF THE MOST INSOLENT AMONG THEM TO SHOW THEIR PURPOSE OF LEVELLING ALL MANKIND FORCED KISSES FROM HER BUT THEY ALLOWED HER TO CONTINUE HER JOURNEY WITHOUT ATTEMPTING ANY FURTHER INJURY
7445-94522-0027 CUT OFF THE HEADS OF ALL THE GENTLEMEN WHOM THEY LAID HOLD OF EXPRESSED A PARTICULAR ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE LAWYERS AND ATTORNEYS AND PILLAGED THE WAREHOUSES OF THE RICH MERCHANTS A GREAT BODY OF THEM QUARTERED THEMSELVES AT MILE END
7445-94522-0028 FREEDOM OF COMMERCE IN MARKET TOWNS WITHOUT TOLL OR IMPOST AND A FIXED RENT ON LANDS INSTEAD OF THE SERVICES DUE BY VILLAINAGE THESE REQUESTS WHICH THOUGH EXTREMELY REASONABLE IN THEMSELVES THE NATION WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY PREPARED TO RECEIVE
7445-94522-0029 AND WHICH IT WAS DANGEROUS TO HAVE EXTORTED BY VIOLENCE WERE HOWEVER COMPLIED WITH
7445-94522-0030 DREW HIS SWORD AND STRUCK HIM SO VIOLENT A BLOW AS BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WHERE HE WAS INSTANTLY DESPATCHED BY OTHERS OF THE KING'S ATTENDANTS THE MUTINEERS SEEING THEIR LEADER FALL PREPARED THEMSELVES FOR REVENGE
7445-94522-0031 THE POPULACE OVERAWED BY HIS PRESENCE IMPLICITLY FOLLOWED HIM HE LED THEM INTO THE FIELDS TO PREVENT ANY DISORDER WHICH MIGHT HAVE ARISEN BY THEIR CONTINUING IN THE CITY
7445-94522-0032 SOON AFTER THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY HEARING OF THE KING'S DANGER IN WHICH THEY WERE ALL INVOLVED FLOCKED TO LONDON WITH THEIR ADHERENTS AND RETAINERS AND RICHARD TOOK THE FIELD AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY FORTY THOUSAND STRONG
7445-94522-0033 SOME WERE EVEN EXECUTED WITHOUT PROCESS OR FORM OF LAW IT WAS PRETENDED THAT THE INTENTIONS OF THE MUTINEERS HAD BEEN TO SEIZE THE KING'S PERSON TO CARRY HIM THROUGH ENGLAND AT THEIR HEAD
7445-94522-0034 TO MURDER ALL THE NOBILITY GENTRY AND LAWYERS AND EVEN ALL THE BISHOPS AND PRIESTS EXCEPT THE MENDICANT FRIARS TO DESPATCH AFTERWARDS THE KING HIMSELF AND HAVING THUS REDUCED ALL TO A LEVEL TO ORDER THE KINGDOM AT THEIR PLEASURE
7445-94522-0035 IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT MANY OF THEM IN THE DELIRIUM OF THEIR FIRST SUCCESS MIGHT HAVE FORMED SUCH PROJECTS BUT OF ALL THE EVILS INCIDENT TO HUMAN SOCIETY THE INSURRECTIONS OF THE POPULACE WHEN NOT RAISED AND SUPPORTED BY PERSONS OF HIGHER QUALITY
7445-94522-0036 AND JOHN DE VIENNE ADMIRAL OF FRANCE HAD BEEN SENT OVER WITH A BODY OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEN AT ARMS TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR INCURSIONS AGAINST THE ENGLISH THE DANGER WAS NOW DEEMED BY THE KING'S UNCLES SOMEWHAT SERIOUS
7445-94522-0037 THE SCOTS TO THE NUMBER OF THIRTY THOUSAND MEN ATTENDED BY THE FRENCH ENTERED THE BORDERS OF ENGLAND BY THE WEST AND CARRYING THEIR RAVAGES THROUGH CUMBERLAND WESTMORELAND AND LANCASHIRE COLLECTED A RICH BOOTY AND THEN RETURNED IN TRANQUILLITY TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY
7445-94522-0038 RICHARD MEANWHILE ADVANCED TOWARDS EDINBURGH AND DESTROYED IN HIS WAY ALL THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES ON EACH SIDE OF HIM HE REDUCED THAT CITY TO ASHES HE TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER PERTH DUNDEE AND OTHER PLACES IN THE LOW COUNTRIES
7445-94522-0039 AND HE LED BACK HIS ARMY WITHOUT EFFECTING ANY THING BY ALL THESE MIGHTY PREPARATIONS THE SCOTS SOON AFTER FINDING THE HEAVY BODIES OF FRENCH CAVALRY VERY USELESS IN THAT DESULTORY KIND OF WAR TO WHICH THEY CONFINED THEMSELVES
7445-94522-0040 TREATED THEIR ALLIES SO ILL THAT THE FRENCH RETURNED HOME MUCH DISGUSTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND WITH THE MANNERS OF ITS INHABITANTS AND THE ENGLISH THOUGH THEY REGRETTED THE INDOLENCE AND LEVITY OF THEIR KING
