1815-9918-0012 THAT GALILEO AND NEWTON
1815-9918-0013 BUT HE DID NOT GET THEM FROM HIS FATHER
1815-9918-0014 SOME PEOPLE OR OTHER HAD CLOTHED HIM IN RAGS OUT OF CHARITY
1815-9918-0015 HE WAS ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN MOST DESERVING OF PITY AMONG ALL ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE FATHER AND MOTHER AND WHO ARE ORPHANS NEVERTHELESS THIS CHILD NEVER FELT SO WELL AS WHEN HE WAS IN THE STREET
1815-9918-0016 THE PAVEMENTS WERE LESS HARD TO HIM THAN HIS MOTHER'S HEART HIS PARENTS HAD DESPATCHED HIM INTO LIFE WITH A KICK HE SIMPLY TOOK FLIGHT HE WAS A BOISTEROUS PALLID NIMBLE WIDE AWAKE JEERING LAD
1815-9918-0017 HE WENT AND CAME SANG PLAYED AT HOPSCOTCH SCRAPED THE GUTTERS STOLE A LITTLE BUT LIKE CATS AND SPARROWS GAYLY LAUGHED WHEN HE WAS CALLED A ROGUE AND GOT ANGRY WHEN CALLED A THIEF HE HAD NO SHELTER NO BREAD
1815-9918-0018 NO FIRE NO LOVE BUT HE WAS MERRY BECAUSE HE WAS FREE WHEN THESE POOR CREATURES GROW TO BE MEN THE MILLSTONES OF THE SOCIAL ORDER MEET THEM AND CRUSH THEM BUT SO LONG AS THEY ARE CHILDREN
1815-9918-0019 THEY ESCAPE BECAUSE OF THEIR SMALLNESS THE TINIEST HOLE SAVES THEM NEVERTHELESS ABANDONED AS THIS CHILD WAS IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED EVERY TWO OR THREE MONTHS THAT HE SAID COME I'LL GO AND SEE MAMMA
1815-9918-0020 THEN HE QUITTED THE BOULEVARD THE CIRQUE THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN DESCENDED TO THE QUAYS CROSSED THE BRIDGES REACHED THE SUBURBS ARRIVED AT THE SALPETRIERE AND CAME TO A HALT WHERE
1815-9918-0021 PRECISELY AT THAT DOUBLE NUMBER FIFTY FIFTY TWO WITH WHICH THE READER IS ACQUAINTED AT THE GORBEAU HOVEL AT THAT EPOCH THE HOVEL FIFTY FIFTY TWO GENERALLY DESERTED AND ETERNALLY DECORATED WITH THE PLACARD
1815-9918-0022 CHAMBERS TO LET CHANCED TO BE A RARE THING INHABITED BY NUMEROUS INDIVIDUALS WHO HOWEVER AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE IN PARIS HAD NO CONNECTION WITH EACH OTHER
1815-9918-0023 AND WHICH EXTENDS FROM MISERY TO MISERY INTO THE LOWEST DEPTHS OF SOCIETY DOWN TO THOSE TWO BEINGS IN WHOM ALL THE MATERIAL THINGS OF CIVILIZATION END THE SEWER MAN WHO SWEEPS UP THE MUD AND THE RAGPICKER
1815-9918-0024 WHO COLLECTS SCRAPS THE PRINCIPAL LODGER OF JEAN VALJEAN'S DAY WAS DEAD
1815-9918-0025 I KNOW NOT WHAT PHILOSOPHER HAS SAID OLD WOMEN ARE NEVER LACKING THIS NEW OLD WOMAN WAS NAMED MADAME BOURGON AND HAD NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT HER LIFE EXCEPT A DYNASTY OF THREE PAROQUETS WHO HAD REIGNED IN SUCCESSION OVER HER SOUL
1815-9918-0026 THE MOST MISERABLE OF THOSE WHO INHABITED THE HOVEL WERE A FAMILY OF FOUR PERSONS CONSISTING OF FATHER MOTHER AND TWO DAUGHTERS ALREADY WELL GROWN ALL FOUR OF WHOM WERE LODGED IN THE SAME ATTIC ONE OF THE CELLS WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED
1815-9918-0027 THE FATHER WHEN HE HIRED THE CHAMBER HAD STATED THAT HIS NAME WAS JONDRETTE SOME TIME AFTER HIS MOVING IN WHICH HAD BORNE A SINGULAR RESEMBLANCE TO THE ENTRANCE OF NOTHING AT ALL TO BORROW THE MEMORABLE EXPRESSION OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT
1815-9918-0028 WHO LIKE HER PREDECESSOR WAS AT THE SAME TIME PORTRESS AND STAIR SWEEPER MOTHER SO AND SO IF ANY ONE SHOULD CHANCE TO COME AND INQUIRE FOR A POLE OR AN ITALIAN OR EVEN A SPANIARD PERCHANCE IT IS I

1815-9918-0030 WHEN HE ENTERED HE WAS ASKED WHENCE COME YOU HE REPLIED FROM THE STREET WHEN HE WENT AWAY THEY ASKED HIM WHITHER ARE YOU GOING HE REPLIED INTO THE STREETS

1815-9918-0032 HE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW A FATHER AND MOTHER SHOULD BE NEVERTHELESS HIS MOTHER LOVED HIS SISTERS
