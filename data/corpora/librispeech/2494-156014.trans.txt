2494-156014-0000 THE APHORISM AS A MAN THINKETH IN HIS HEART SO IS HE
2494-156014-0001 AND COULD NOT BE WITHOUT THE SEED SO EVERY ACT OF A MAN SPRINGS FROM THE HIDDEN SEEDS OF THOUGHT AND COULD NOT HAVE APPEARED WITHOUT THEM THIS APPLIES EQUALLY TO THOSE ACTS CALLED SPONTANEOUS AND UNPREMEDITATED AS TO THOSE WHICH ARE DELIBERATELY EXECUTED
2494-156014-0002 IF A MAN'S MIND HATH EVIL THOUGHTS PAIN COMES ON HIM AS COMES THE WHEEL THE OX BEHIND IF ONE ENDURE IN PURITY OF THOUGHT JOY FOLLOWS HIM AS HIS OWN SHADOW SURE
2494-156014-0003 MAN IS A GROWTH BY LAW AND NOT A CREATION BY ARTIFICE
2494-156014-0004 AS IN THE WORLD OF VISIBLE AND MATERIAL THINGS A NOBLE AND GODLIKE CHARACTER IS NOT A THING OF FAVOUR OR CHANCE BUT IS THE NATURAL RESULT OF CONTINUED EFFORT IN RIGHT THINKING
2494-156014-0005 THE EFFECT OF LONG CHERISHED ASSOCIATION WITH GODLIKE THOUGHTS
2494-156014-0006 BY THE SAME PROCESS IS THE RESULT OF THE CONTINUED HARBOURING OF GROVELLING THOUGHTS MAN IS MADE OR UNMADE BY HIMSELF IN THE ARMOURY OF THOUGHT HE FORGES THE WEAPONS BY WHICH HE DESTROYS HIMSELF
2494-156014-0007 HE ALSO FASHIONS THE TOOLS WITH WHICH HE BUILDS FOR HIMSELF HEAVENLY MANSIONS OF JOY AND STRENGTH AND PEACE BY THE RIGHT CHOICE AND TRUE APPLICATION OF THOUGHT MAN ASCENDS TO THE DIVINE PERFECTION BY THE ABUSE AND WRONG APPLICATION OF THOUGHT
2494-156014-0008 BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES ARE ALL THE GRADES OF CHARACTER AND MAN IS THEIR MAKER AND MASTER OF ALL THE BEAUTIFUL TRUTHS PERTAINING TO THE SOUL WHICH HAVE BEEN RESTORED AND BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN THIS AGE
2494-156014-0009 NONE IS MORE GLADDENING OR FRUITFUL OF DIVINE PROMISE AND CONFIDENCE THAN THIS THAT MAN IS THE MASTER OF THOUGHT THE MOULDER OF CHARACTER AND THE MAKER AND SHAPER OF CONDITION ENVIRONMENT AND DESTINY AS A BEING OF POWER
2494-156014-0010 INTELLIGENCE AND LOVE AND THE LORD OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS MAN HOLDS THE KEY TO EVERY SITUATION AND CONTAINS WITHIN HIMSELF THAT TRANSFORMING AND REGENERATIVE AGENCY BY WHICH HE MAY MAKE HIMSELF WHAT HE WILLS
2494-156014-0011 MAN IS ALWAYS THE MASTER
2494-156014-0012 HE THEN BECOMES THE WISE MASTER DIRECTING HIS ENERGIES WITH INTELLIGENCE AND FASHIONING HIS THOUGHTS TO FRUITFUL ISSUES SUCH IS THE CONSCIOUS MASTER AND MAN CAN ONLY THUS BECOME BY DISCOVERING WITHIN HIMSELF
2494-156014-0013 THE LAWS OF THOUGHT WHICH DISCOVERY IS TOTALLY A MATTER OF APPLICATION SELF ANALYSIS AND EXPERIENCE ONLY BY MUCH SEARCHING AND MINING ARE GOLD AND DIAMONDS OBTAINED
2494-156014-0014 AND MAN CAN FIND EVERY TRUTH CONNECTED WITH HIS BEING IF HE WILL DIG DEEP INTO THE MINE OF HIS SOUL AND THAT HE IS THE MAKER OF HIS CHARACTER THE MOULDER OF HIS LIFE AND THE BUILDER OF HIS DESTINY
