111-126277-0000 I AM TOLD BY ONE WHO OUGHT TO KNOW FOR HE IS AN OLD RESIDENT THAT IF YOU FOLLOW ITS TORTUOUS COURSE FAR ENOUGH IT WILL LEAD YOU TO A TOWN CALLED
111-126277-0001 A WEATHER BEATEN COTTAGE NEARLY HIDDEN BY THE PEPPER AND ACACIA TREES THAT SURROUND IT
111-126277-0002 TO WRITE THAT BEAUTIFUL POEM CONTAINING THE LINES LET ME LIVE IN A HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND BE A FRIEND TO MAN FOR THE COOLING DRAUGHT PASSED OUT TO ME ONE HOT AFTERNOON FROM THIS HOUSE
111-126277-0003 WOULD CERTAINLY CLASS THE OCCUPANT AS A BENEFACTOR THE DEW WAS SPARKLING ON THE GRASS WHEN I SET OUT IN THE EARLY MORNING GOSSAMER SPIDER WEBS STRUNG FROM LEAF AND STEM
111-126277-0004 GLISTENED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND UP FROM A TUFT OF GRASS A MEADOW LARK SPRANG ON SILENT WING SCATTERING HIS SILVERY NOTES A PAEAN OF PRAISE TO THE EARLY DAWN
111-126277-0005 A BLUEBIRD'S NOTES BLEND WITH THOSE OF THE SONG SPARROW AND A ROBIN SWINGING ON THE TOPMOST BRANCH OF A EUCALYPTUS AFTER A FEW SHORT NOTES
111-126277-0006 POURS FORTH A PERFECT RHAPSODY OF MELODY AT THIS PLACE A HILL ENCROACHES UPON THE ROAD AT THE RIGHT COVERED THICKLY WITH UNDERBRUSH AND BLACKBERRY VINES ITS CREST
111-126277-0007 SURMOUNTED WITH A STATELY GROVE OF EUCALYPTUS TREES WHILE ON THE LEFT THERE IS AN ALMOST PERPENDICULAR DROP TO THE VALLEY BELOW SO NARROW IS THE ROAD THAT TEAMS CAN HARDLY PASS EACH OTHER
111-126277-0008 WHY IT SHOULD CROWD ITSELF INTO SUCH NARROW QUARTERS WHEN THERE IS ROOM TO SPARE
111-126277-0009 NOD TO IT FROM THE MEADOW AND THE LAVENDER SNAP DRAGONS WAVE THEIR THREADLIKE FINGERS IN SILENT GREETING TALL STATELY TEASELS STAND LIKE SENTINELS ALONG THE WAY
111-126277-0010 AND THE BALSAMIC TARWEED SPREADS ITS FRAGRANCE ALONG THE OUTER EDGE THREADING ITS WAY DOWN A STEEP HILL
111-126277-0011 THROUGH A WEALTH OF TANGLED GRASSES PAST A GROVE OF LIVE OAKS FROM WHOSE TWISTED AND CONTORTED LIMBS THE GRAY MOSS HANGS IN LONG FESTOONS BY INDIAN PAINTBRUSH
111-126277-0012 GLEAMING LIKE SPARKS OF FIRE AMID THE GREEN AND BRONZE FOLIAGE IT GLIDES AT LAST INTO A SOMBER CANON
111-126277-0013 THERE A BRIDGE SPANS THE BROOK THAT GURGLES ITS ELFIN SONG TO CHEER THE DUSTY TRAVELER ON ITS WAY THE LAUREL MADRONE AND MANZANITAS
111-126277-0014 RUNNING THE WHOLE GAMUT OF TONES FROM TREBLE TO BASS HIDDEN AWAY AMID THE WATER GRASSES DARNING NEEDLES DODGE IN AND OUT AMONG THE RUSHES IN ERRATIC FLIGHT AND A BLACKBIRD TEETERS UP AND DOWN
111-126277-0015 ON A TULLE STEM WHILE REPEATING OVER AND OVER HIS PLEASANT
111-126277-0016 BUT THE ROAD DOES NOT STOP TO LOOK OR LISTEN AND ONCE MORE IT CLIMBS THE HILL WHERE THE GOLDEN POPPY BASKS IN THE SUNSHINE AND THE DANDELIONS SPREAD THEIR YELLOW CARPET FOR IT TO PASS OVER
111-126277-0017 OR NODDING SILKEN HEADS SCATTER THEIR TINY FLEET OF A HUNDRED FAIRY BALLOONS UPON THE WINGS OF THE SUMMER WINDS DOWN THE ROAD WHISTLING BLITHELY COMES A SLIP OF A BOY
111-126277-0018 WITH FISHING ROD CUT FROM THE ADJACENT THICKET OVER HIS SHOULDER AND A CAN OF BAIT TUCKED SECURELY UNDER HIS ARM HAPPY AS A KING IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FISH HE MAY NEVER CATCH AT HIS HEELS TROTS
111-126277-0019 CONTENTEDLY A YELLOW DOG TRUE COMPANIONS OF THE HIGHWAY ARE THEY FOR NO COUNTRY ROAD WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT ITS BOY AND DOG AND AS I PASS THEM I CALL BACK GOOD LUCK MY DOUGHTY FISHERMAN
111-126277-0020 AND THE ROAD ANSWERS
111-126277-0021 GOOD LUCK GOOD LUCK
111-126277-0022 AND HILLSIDE THE SOFT LIGHT OF EVENING TOUCHES THE TOPS OF TREE AND SHRUB WITH A ROSY SPLENDOR
111-126277-0023 TO GOLD FROM GOLD TO PURPLE AND THROUGH THE GATHERING DUSK THE ROAD SINKS INTO THE SURROUNDING GLOOM
