2208-11020-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN MARIAN'S HOME THREE WEEKS AFTER HER RETURN FROM THE COUNTRY WHICH TOOK PLACE A WEEK LATER THAN THAT OF JASPER MILVAIN MARIAN YULE WAS WORKING ONE AFTERNOON AT HER USUAL PLACE
2208-11020-0001 IN THE MUSEUM READING ROOM IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AND WITH THE INTERVAL OF HALF AN HOUR AT MIDDAY WHEN SHE WENT AWAY FOR A CUP OF TEA AND A SANDWICH SHE HAD BEEN CLOSELY OCCUPIED SINCE HALF PAST NINE
2208-11020-0002 HER TASK AT PRESENT WAS TO COLLECT MATERIALS FOR A PAPER ON FRENCH AUTHORESSES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE KIND OF THING WHICH HER FATHER SUPPLIED ON STIPULATED TERMS FOR ANONYMOUS PUBLICATION
2208-11020-0003 MARIAN WAS BY THIS TIME ALMOST ABLE TO COMPLETE SUCH A PIECE OF MANUFACTURE HERSELF AND HER FATHER'S SHARE IN IT WAS LIMITED TO A FEW HINTS AND CORRECTIONS
2208-11020-0004 THE GREATER PART OF THE WORK BY WHICH YULE EARNED HIS MODERATE INCOME WAS ANONYMOUS VOLUMES AND ARTICLES WHICH BORE HIS SIGNATURE DEALT WITH MUCH THE SAME SUBJECTS AS HIS UNSIGNED MATTER
2208-11020-0005 BUT THE WRITING WAS LABOURED WITH A CONSCIENTIOUSNESS UNUSUAL IN MEN OF HIS POSITION THE RESULT UNHAPPILY WAS NOT CORRESPONDENT WITH THE EFFORTS ALFRED YULE HAD MADE A RECOGNISABLE NAME AMONG THE CRITICAL WRITERS OF THE DAY
2208-11020-0006 SEEING HIM IN THE TITLE LISTS OF A PERIODICAL MOST PEOPLE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT BUT NOT A FEW FORBORE THE CUTTING OPEN OF THE PAGES HE OCCUPIED HE WAS LEARNED COPIOUS OCCASIONALLY MORDANT IN STYLE
2208-11020-0007 HE HAD OF LATE BEGUN TO PERCEIVE THE FACT THAT THOSE PASSAGES OF MARIAN'S WRITING WHICH WERE PRINTED JUST AS THEY CAME FROM HER PEN
2208-11020-0008 AND IT BEGAN TO BE A QUESTION WITH HIM WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO LET THE GIRL SIGN THESE COMPOSITIONS A MATTER OF BUSINESS TO BE SURE AT ALL EVENTS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
2208-11020-0009 FOR A LONG TIME MARIAN HAD SCARCELY LOOKED UP FROM THE DESK BUT AT THIS MOMENT SHE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO REFER TO THE INVALUABLE LAROUSSE AS SO OFTEN HAPPENED THE PARTICULAR VOLUME OF WHICH SHE HAD NEED WAS NOT UPON THE SHELF
2208-11020-0010 SHE TURNED AWAY AND LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH A GAZE OF WEARY DISAPPOINTMENT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WERE STANDING TWO YOUNG MEN ENGAGED AS THEIR FACES SHOWED IN FACETIOUS COLLOQUY AS SOON AS SHE OBSERVED THEM
2208-11020-0011 MARIAN'S EYES FELL BUT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE LOOKED AGAIN IN THAT DIRECTION HER FACE HAD WHOLLY CHANGED SHE WORE A LOOK OF TIMID EXPECTANCY THE MEN WERE MOVING TOWARDS HER STILL TALKING AND LAUGHING
2208-11020-0012 SHE TURNED TO THE SHELVES AND AFFECTED TO SEARCH FOR A BOOK THE VOICES DREW NEAR AND ONE OF THEM WAS WELL KNOWN TO HER NOW SHE COULD HEAR EVERY WORD NOW THE SPEAKERS WERE GONE BY WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT MISTER MILVAIN HAD NOT RECOGNISED HER
2208-11020-0013 SHE WENT BACK TO HER PLACE AND FOR SOME MINUTES SAT TRIFLING WITH A PEN WHEN SHE MADE A SHOW OF RESUMING WORK IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER APPLY HERSELF AS BEFORE EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE GLANCED AT PEOPLE WHO WERE PASSING

2208-11020-0043 BUT SHE STILL FOLLOWED AT A VERY LITTLE DISTANCE HIS WALK WAS SLOW AND SHE MIGHT EASILY HAVE PASSED HIM IN QUITE A NATURAL WAY IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT HELP SEEING HER
2208-11020-0044 BUT THERE WAS AN UNEASY SUSPICION IN HER MIND THAT HE REALLY MUST HAVE NOTICED HER IN THE READING ROOM THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD SEEN HIM SINCE THEIR PARTING AT FINDEN HAD HE ANY REASON FOR AVOIDING HER
