3157-168062-0028 LOOKED DOWN ON THEM WITH HER EYES AND WITH HER HEART YET ENVIED WHILE SHE LOOKED ENVIED THEIR FREE AND EASY LIFE WITHOUT A CARE TO HARASS THEM SO SHE THOUGHT

3157-168062-0031 THE SWEEPING DUSTING MAKING BEDS TRIMMING LAMPS WORKING FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT NO TIME FOR READING OR STUDY OR PLEASURE SADIE HAD SAID SHE WAS CROSS AND SADIE HAD TOLD THE TRUTH

3157-168062-0034 AND ALL THEY HAD NOT ESTER DID NOT THINK OF THIS SO MUCH ASLEEP WAS SHE THAT SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT NONE OF THOSE GAY HEARTS DOWN THERE BELOW HER HAD BEEN GIVEN UP TO CHRIST NOT ONE OF THEM

3157-168062-0037 SHE WORKED DAILY SIDE BY SIDE WITH A MOTHER WHO THROUGH MANY TRIALS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS WAS LIVING A CHRISTIAN LIFE AND NEVER TALKED WITH HER OF THEIR FUTURE REST SHE MET DAILY SOMETIMES ALMOST HOURLY
