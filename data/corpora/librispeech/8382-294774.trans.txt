8382-294774-0000 THE BRAGGING PEACOCK THE FARMYARD PEOPLE WILL NEVER FORGET THE COMING OF THE PEACOCK OR RATHER THEY WILL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST DAY THAT HE SPENT WITH THEM HE CAME IN THE EVENING AFTER ALL THE FOWLS HAD GONE TO ROOST
8382-294774-0001 AND THEIR FOUR LEGGED FRIENDS WERE DOZING COMFORTABLY IN MEADOW AND PASTURE CORNERS SO NOBODY SAW HIM UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW SURPRISED THEY WERE WHEN A BEAUTIFUL GREAT FOWL OF GREENISH BLUE
8382-294774-0002 STRUTTED ACROSS THE YARD HOLDING HIS HEAD WELL IN THE AIR AND DRAGGING HIS SPLENDID TRAIN BEHIND HIM THE FOWLS WERE JUST STARTING OUT FOR THEIR DAILY WALKS AND THEY STOPPED AND HELD ONE FOOT IN THE AIR AND STARED AND STARED AND STARED THEY DID NOT MEAN TO BE RUDE
8382-294774-0003 BUT THEY WERE SO VERY MUCH SURPRISED THAT THEY DID NOT THINK WHAT THEY WERE DOING MOST OF THEM THOUGHT THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING AND THE DREAM WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL ONE THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO MOVE AND BREAK IT OFF THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A PEACOCK AND DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THERE WAS SUCH A FOWL
8382-294774-0004 ONE OF THE CLOUD BIRDS IS WALKING IN THE FARMYARD
8382-294774-0005 AND WATCHED THE CLOUDS AND THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE BIRDS AND DROPPED SHINING WORMS FROM THEIR BEAKS THEN THE PEACOCK WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SHEEP LANGUAGE PERFECTLY SAID PAON I AM NO CLOUD BIRD I AM A PEACOCK
8382-294774-0006 HE SAID THIS IN A VERY HAUGHTY WAY AS THOUGH TO BE A PEACOCK WERE THE GRANDEST THING IN THE WORLD FAR BETTER THAN HAVING ONE'S HOME IN THE SKY AND BRINGING SHOWERS TO REFRESH THE THIRSTY EARTH PEOPLE THE TURKEY GOBBLER NEVER COULD STAND IT TO HAVE
8382-294774-0007 OTHERS SPEAK IN THAT WAY WHEN HE WAS AROUND SO HE THOUGHT HE WOULD SHOW THE NEWCOMER HOW IMPORTANT HE WAS HE DREW UP HIS NECK AND PUFFED OUT HIS CHEST HE PULLED HIS SKIN MUSCLES BY THINKING ABOUT THEM
8382-294774-0008 THEY WERE A LITTLE AFRAID OF HIM THEMSELVES BUT THEY LIKED TO HAVE HIM SHOW THE NEWCOMER THAT TURKEYS ARE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THEIR CHILDREN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND MURMURED ISN'T THE GOBBLER FINE THOUGH
8382-294774-0009 BUT THE PEACOCK DID NOT SEEM TO FEEL AT ALL SORRY HE STOOD AND LOOKED AT THEM ALL WITHOUT SAYING A WORD AND THEY ALL WONDERED WHAT HE WAS THINKING THEN A DUCKLING WHO STOOD NEAR HIM EXCLAIMED LOOK AT HIS TRAIN OH
8382-294774-0010 EVERYBODY LOOKED AND SAW ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL LONG FEATHERS RISING INTO THE AIR UP AND UP THEY WENT AND SPREADING AS THEY ROSE UNTIL THERE WAS A WONDERFUL GREAT CIRCLE OF THEM BACK OF HIS BODY
8382-294774-0011 THEN HE STALKED OFF WITH THE MEEK HEN TURKEYS FOLLOWING AND THE CHILDREN LAGGING BEHIND THEY DID SO WANT TO STAY AND SEE THE PEACOCK AND THEY THOUGHT THE DUCKLINGS AND GOSLINGS WERE MUCH LUCKIER THAN THEY THE GEESE WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE NEWCOMER
8382-294774-0012 AND HOPED HE WOULD BE QUITE FRIENDLY WITH THEM THEY WISHED HE WERE A SWIMMER
8382-294774-0013 HE DID NOT HAVE THE TRIM BOAT SHAPED BODY THAT SWIMMERS HAVE AND THEN HIS FEET WERE NOT WEBBED THE GANDER NOTICED THAT THEY WERE REMARKABLY HOMELY FEET HE THOUGHT HE WOULD REMEMBER THIS AND SPEAK OF IT TO THE GEESE SOME TIME WHEN THEY WERE PRAISING THE PEACOCK'S TRAIN
8382-294774-0014 THE DRAKE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK POLITELY TO THE PEACOCK WE ARE GLAD TO MEET YOU SIR HE SAID WILL YOU BE WITH US LONG THANK YOU ANSWERED THE PEACOCK I HAVE COME TO STAY
8382-294774-0015 WE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF YOUR COMPANY IF YOU DID YOU WILL EXCUSE US IF WE GO ON TO THE BROOK WE ARE LATE ALREADY
8382-294774-0016 A FINE LOOKING FELLOW SAID HE HEARTILY EVEN MY COUSINS THE MALLARD DUCKS HAVE NOT SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SHEEN ON THEIR NECK FEATHERS THE DRAKE WAS A KIND WARM HEARTED FELLOW AND IT NEVER TROUBLED HIM TO KNOW THAT OTHER PEOPLE WERE HANDSOMER THAN HE
8382-294774-0017 THE GEESE WERE EAGER TO REACH THE WATER TOO BUT THEY COULD NOT LEAVE WITHOUT ASKING ONE QUESTION FIRST THEY TOLD THE GANDER TO ASK IT BUT HE REPLIED THAT IF THEY WANTED TO KNOW THEY SHOULD ASK IT FOR THEMSELVES THEN THEY HUNG BACK AND SAID TO EACH OTHER
8382-294774-0018 YOU ASK HIM I CAN'T AT LAST THE GRAY GOOSE STEPPED FORWARD SAYING EXCUSE US SIR
8382-294774-0019 I WORK CRIED HE PAON NEVER THE FARMER INVITED ME HERE TO BE BEAUTIFUL THAT IS ALL WE ARE SO GLAD CACKLED THE GEESE AND THE GANDER JOINED WITH THEM SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE HERE WORK THEY ARE VERY GOOD BUT NOT AT ALL GENTEEL YOU UNDERSTAND
8382-294774-0020 HAVEN'T YOU BEEN PLUCKED THIS WAS VERY EMBARRASSING TO THE GEESE WHY YES THEY SAID WE DO LET THE FARMER'S WIFE HAVE SOME FEATHERS ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN THE WEATHER IS WARM BUT THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM REALLY WORKING YOU KNOW PERHAPS SAID THE PEACOCK
8382-294774-0021 IF THEY WANT ANY OF MY FEATHERS THEY CAN WAIT UNTIL I MOULT
8382-294774-0022 NOT TAIL IF YOU PLEASE EVERY BIRD HAS A TAIL BUT I HAVE A TRAIN THEY CARRY IT CAREFULLY INTO THE HOUSE TO BE MADE INTO A DUSTER FOR THE PARLOR I NEVER GIVE AWAY ANY BUT MY CAST OFF PLUMAGE I AM SO VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO WORK
8382-294774-0023 THIS IMPRESSED THE GEESE VERY MUCH WE ARE GLAD TO KNOW YOU
8382-294774-0024 AND THEY BOWED THEIR UNCRESTED AND VERY SILLY ONES
8382-294774-0025 THE PEACOCK THOUGHT THEM MOST AGREEABLE BECAUSE THEY ADMIRED HIM AND THEY THOUGHT HIM THE BEST SORT OF ACQUAINTANCE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WORK IT WAS ALL VERY FOOLISH BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS FOOLISH PEOPLE IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW AND IT IS MUCH BETTER TO BE AMUSED BY IT AND A LITTLE SORRY FOR THEM
8382-294774-0026 THAN FOR US TO LOSE OUR TEMPERS AND BECOME CROSS ABOUT IT THAT WAS THE WAY THE SHANGHAIS BLACK SPANISH DORKING AND BANTAM FOWLS FELT THEY WERE POLITE ENOUGH TO THE NEWCOMER BUT THEY DID NOT RUN AFTER HIM THE CHICKENS USED TO LAUGH WHEN THE PEACOCK UTTERED HIS CRY OF
8382-294774-0027 PAON PAON HIS VOICE WAS HARSH AND DISAGREEABLE AND IT DID SEEM SO FUNNY TO HEAR SUCH DREADFUL SOUNDS COMING FROM SUCH A LOVELY THROAT THE BLACK SPANISH COCK REPROVED THE CHICKENS SHARPLY FOR THIS IT IS VERY RUDE SAID HE TO LAUGH AT PEOPLE FOR THINGS THEY CANNOT HELP
8382-294774-0028 HE HAS ONLY TWO LEGS HELLO LITTLE TWO LEGS HOW CAN YOU WALK IT IS JUST AS BAD FOR YOU TO LAUGH AT HIS HARSH VOICE BECAUSE HE CANNOT HELP IT IF HE SHOULD SAY FOOLISH AND SILLY THINGS YOU MIGHT LAUGH BECAUSE HE COULD HELP THAT IF HE TRIED
8382-294774-0029 DON'T EVER AGAIN LET ME HEAR YOU LAUGHING WHEN HE IS JUST SAYING PAON THE CHICKENS MINDED THE BLACK SPANISH COCK FOR THEY KNEW HE WAS RIGHT AND THAT HE DID NOT DO RUDE THINGS HIMSELF THEY REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE SAID TOO ONE DAY THE PEACOCK WAS STANDING ON THE FENCE ALONE
8382-294774-0030 HE DID THIS MOST OF THE TIME HE USUALLY STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO THE FARMYARD SO THAT PEOPLE WHO PASSED COULD SEE HIS TRAIN BUT NOT HIS FEET A PARTY OF YOUNG FOWLS OF ALL FAMILIES CAME ALONG THEIR MOTHERS HAD LET THEM GO OFF BY THEMSELVES AND THEY STOPPED TO LOOK AT THE PEACOCK
8382-294774-0031 HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD A JOKE ANYWAY HE WAS ALWAYS SO BUSY THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF THAT HE COULDN'T SEE THE POINT NOW HE CLEARED HIS THROAT AND SPOKE TO THE BANTAM CHICKEN I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK THAT I GREW MY TRAIN IN A MINUTE SAID HE IT TOOK ME A LONG LONG TIME
8382-294774-0032 ALTHOUGH I KEPT ALL THE FEATHERS GOING AT ONCE LOOK AT HIS CREST EXCLAIMED ONE YOUNG TURKEY IN HIS PIPING VOICE THE PEACOCK TURNED HIS HEAD SO THAT THEY COULD SEE IT MORE PLAINLY THAT IS A CREST TO BE PROUD OF HE SAID
8382-294774-0033 I HAVE NEVER SEEN A FINER ONE MYSELF HAVE YOU NOTICED THE BEAUTY OF MY NECK CHARMING WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG FOWLS
8382-294774-0034 WHAT HOMELY FEET YOU HAVE THIS SQUAB EXCLAIMED ARE YOU NOT DREADFULLY ASHAMED OF THEM THE YOUNG FOWLS THOUGHT THIS RUDE NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE SAID IT THE PEACOCK BECAME VERY ANGRY
8382-294774-0035 I KNOW MY FEET ARE NOT SO HANDSOME AS THEY MIGHT BE HE SAID BUT THAT IS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEM I COULDN'T HELP HAVING THAT KIND OF FEET THEY RUN IN MY FAMILY I DON'T FEEL ASHAMED OF THINGS I CAN'T HELP
8382-294774-0036 THE YOUNG FOWLS FELT SO UNCOMFORTABLE AFTER THIS THAT THEY WALKED AWAY AND THE SQUAB FLEW BACK TO THE DOVE COTE
8382-294774-0037 THEN A GOSLING WHO HAD HEARD HER MOTHER TALK ABOUT THE PEACOCK SAID I SHOULD THINK HE WOULD BE PROUD OF HIS TRAIN AND HIS CREST AND HIS NECK AND AND EVERYTHING EVERYTHING EXCEPT HIS FEET GIGGLED THE BANTAM CHICKEN AND YOU KNOW HE COULDN'T HELP HAVING THEM
8382-294774-0038 I WONDER IF HE COULD HELP HAVING HIS TRAIN AND HIS CREST AND HIS NECK AND AND EVERYTHING SAID A YOUNG TURKEY THEY ALL STOPPED WHERE THEY WERE WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY CRIED WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
8382-294774-0039 HE IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND HE KNOWS ALMOST EVERYTHING THEY STALKED AND WADDLED OVER TO THE BLIND HORSE AND THE DUCKLING TOLD HIM WHAT WAS PUZZLING THEM THE BLIND HORSE LAUGHED VERY HEARTILY SO THE PEACOCK IS PROUD OF HAVING GROWN SUCH A FINE TRAIN AND CREST
8382-294774-0040 BUT HE ISN'T ASHAMED OF HIS HOMELY FEET BECAUSE HE COULDN'T HELP HAVING THOSE THERE IS NO REASON FOR EITHER PRIDE OR SHAME WITH THE PEACOCK HE HAS JUST SUCH A BODY AS WAS GIVEN HIM AND HE COULDN'T MAKE ONE FEATHER GROW DIFFERENTLY IF HE TRIED
