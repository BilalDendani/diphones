1924-132574-0000 WE NOW RETURN FOR A MOMENT TO VENICE WHERE COUNT MORANO WAS SUFFERING UNDER AN ACCUMULATION OF MISFORTUNES SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN THAT CITY
1924-132574-0001 HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY ORDER OF THE SENATE AND WITHOUT KNOWING OF WHAT HE WAS SUSPECTED WAS CONVEYED TO A PLACE OF CONFINEMENT WHITHER THE MOST STRENUOUS ENQUIRIES OF HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN UNABLE TO TRACE HIM
1924-132574-0002 WHO THE ENEMY WAS THAT HAD OCCASIONED HIM THIS CALAMITY HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GUESS UNLESS INDEED IT WAS MONTONI ON WHOM HIS SUSPICIONS RESTED AND NOT ONLY WITH MUCH APPARENT PROBABILITY
1924-132574-0003 BUT WITH JUSTICE IN THE AFFAIR OF THE POISONED CUP MONTONI HAD SUSPECTED MORANO BUT BEING UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE DEGREE OF PROOF WHICH WAS NECESSARY TO CONVICT HIM OF A GUILTY INTENTION
1924-132574-0004 HE HAD RECOURSE TO MEANS OF OTHER REVENGE THAN HE COULD HOPE TO OBTAIN BY PROSECUTION HE EMPLOYED A PERSON IN WHOM HE BELIEVED HE MIGHT CONFIDE TO DROP A LETTER OF ACCUSATION INTO
1924-132574-0005 OR LIONS MOUTHS WHICH ARE FIXED IN A GALLERY OF THE DOGE'S PALACE AS RECEPTACLES FOR ANONYMOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING PERSONS WHO MAY BE DISAFFECTED TOWARDS THE STATE
1924-132574-0006 AS ON THESE OCCASIONS THE ACCUSER IS NOT CONFRONTED WITH THE ACCUSED A MAN MAY FALSELY IMPEACH HIS ENEMY AND ACCOMPLISH AN UNJUST REVENGE WITHOUT FEAR OF PUNISHMENT OR DETECTION
1924-132574-0007 THAT MONTONI SHOULD HAVE RECOURSE TO THESE DIABOLICAL MEANS OF RUINING A PERSON WHOM HE SUSPECTED OF HAVING ATTEMPTED HIS LIFE IS NOT IN THE LEAST SURPRISING IN THE LETTER
1924-132574-0008 WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AS THE INSTRUMENT OF HIS REVENGE HE ACCUSED MORANO OF DESIGNS AGAINST THE STATE WHICH HE ATTEMPTED TO PROVE WITH ALL THE PLAUSIBLE SIMPLICITY OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER AND THE SENATE
1924-132574-0009 ALMOST EQUAL TO A PROOF ARRESTED THE COUNT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ACCUSATION AND WITHOUT EVEN HINTING TO HIM HIS CRIME THREW HIM INTO ONE OF THOSE SECRET PRISONS WHICH WERE THE TERROR OF THE VENETIANS
1924-132574-0010 AND IN WHICH PERSONS OFTEN LANGUISHED AND SOMETIMES DIED WITHOUT BEING DISCOVERED BY THEIR FRIENDS MORANO HAD INCURRED THE PERSONAL RESENTMENT OF MANY MEMBERS OF THE STATE
1924-132574-0011 AND HIS AMBITION AND THE BOLD RIVALSHIP WHICH HE DISCOVERED ON SEVERAL PUBLIC OCCASIONS TO OTHERS AND IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT MERCY WOULD SOFTEN THE RIGOUR OF A LAW
1924-132574-0012 HIS CASTLE WAS BESIEGED BY TROOPS WHO SEEMED WILLING TO DARE EVERY THING AND TO SUFFER PATIENTLY ANY HARDSHIPS IN PURSUIT OF VICTORY THE STRENGTH OF THE FORTRESS HOWEVER WITHSTOOD THEIR ATTACK
1924-132574-0013 WHEN UDOLPHO WAS ONCE MORE LEFT TO THE QUIET POSSESSION OF MONTONI HE DISPATCHED UGO INTO TUSCANY FOR EMILY WHOM HE HAD SENT FROM CONSIDERATIONS OF HER PERSONAL SAFETY
1924-132574-0014 TO A PLACE OF GREATER SECURITY THAN A CASTLE WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME LIABLE TO BE OVERRUN BY HIS ENEMIES TRANQUILLITY BEING ONCE MORE RESTORED TO UDOLPHO
1924-132574-0015 HE WAS IMPATIENT TO SECURE HER AGAIN UNDER HIS ROOF AND HAD COMMISSIONED UGO TO ASSIST BERTRAND IN GUARDING HER BACK TO THE CASTLE THUS COMPELLED TO RETURN EMILY BADE THE KIND MADDELINA FAREWELL WITH REGRET
1924-132574-0016 AND AFTER ABOUT A FORTNIGHT'S STAY IN TUSCANY WHERE SHE HAD EXPERIENCED AN INTERVAL OF QUIET WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN HER LONG HARASSED SPIRITS BEGAN ONCE MORE TO ASCEND THE APENNINES
1924-132574-0017 THAT EXTENDED AT THEIR FEET AND TO THE DISTANT MEDITERRANEAN WHOSE WAVES SHE HAD SO OFTEN WISHED WOULD BEAR HER BACK TO FRANCE THE DISTRESS SHE FELT ON HER RETURN TOWARDS THE PLACE OF HER FORMER SUFFERINGS WAS
1924-132574-0018 HOWEVER SOFTENED BY A CONJECTURE THAT VALANCOURT WAS THERE AND SHE FOUND SOME DEGREE OF COMFORT IN THE THOUGHT OF BEING NEAR HIM NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONSIDERATION THAT HE WAS PROBABLY A PRISONER
1924-132574-0019 IT WAS NOON WHEN SHE HAD LEFT THE COTTAGE AND THE EVENING WAS CLOSED LONG BEFORE SHE CAME WITHIN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF UDOLPHO THERE WAS A MOON
1924-132574-0020 BUT IT SHONE ONLY AT INTERVALS FOR THE NIGHT WAS CLOUDY AND LIGHTED BY THE TORCH WHICH UGO CARRIED THE TRAVELLERS PACED SILENTLY ALONG EMILY MUSING ON HER SITUATION AND BERTRAND AND UGO ANTICIPATING
1924-132574-0021 THE COMFORTS OF A FLASK OF WINE AND A GOOD FIRE FOR THEY HAD PERCEIVED FOR SOME TIME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WARM CLIMATE OF THE LOWLANDS OF TUSCANY AND THE NIPPING AIR OF THESE UPPER REGIONS EMILY WAS AT LENGTH
1924-132574-0022 SOME DEGREE OF AWE AS IT ROLLED AWAY ON THE BREEZE ANOTHER AND ANOTHER NOTE SUCCEEDED AND DIED IN SULLEN MURMUR AMONG THE MOUNTAINS TO HER MOURNFUL IMAGINATION
1924-132574-0023 IT SEEMED A KNELL MEASURING OUT SOME FATEFUL PERIOD FOR HER AYE THERE IS THE OLD CLOCK SAID BERTRAND THERE HE IS STILL THE CANNON HAVE NOT SILENCED HIM
1924-132574-0024 HE CROWED AS LOUD AS THE BEST OF THEM IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL THERE HE WAS ROARING OUT IN THE HOTTEST FIRE I HAVE SEEN THIS MANY A DAY
1924-132574-0025 AND THE TOWER TOO THE ROAD WINDING ROUND THE BASE OF A MOUNTAIN THEY NOW CAME WITHIN VIEW OF THE CASTLE WHICH WAS SHEWN IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE VALLEY BY A GLEAM OF MOON SHINE AND THEN VANISHED IN SHADE
1924-132574-0026 WHILE EVEN A TRANSIENT VIEW OF IT HAD AWAKENED THE POIGNANCY OF EMILY'S FEELINGS ITS MASSY AND GLOOMY WALLS GAVE HER TERRIBLE IDEAS OF IMPRISONMENT AND SUFFERING YET AS SHE ADVANCED
1924-132574-0027 SOME DEGREE OF HOPE MINGLED WITH HER TERROR FOR THOUGH THIS WAS CERTAINLY THE RESIDENCE OF MONTONI IT WAS POSSIBLY ALSO THAT OF VALANCOURT AND SHE COULD NOT APPROACH A PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT BE
1924-132574-0028 WITHOUT EXPERIENCING SOMEWHAT OF THE JOY OF HOPE THEY CONTINUED TO WIND ALONG THE VALLEY AND SOON AFTER SHE SAW AGAIN THE OLD WALLS AND MOON LIT TOWERS RISING OVER THE WOODS
1924-132574-0029 THE STRONG RAYS ENABLED HER ALSO TO PERCEIVE THE RAVAGES WHICH THE SIEGE HAD MADE WITH THE BROKEN WALLS AND SHATTERED BATTLEMENTS FOR THEY WERE NOW AT THE FOOT OF THE STEEP ON WHICH UDOLPHO STOOD
1924-132574-0030 MASSY FRAGMENTS HAD ROLLED DOWN AMONG THE WOODS THROUGH WHICH THE TRAVELLERS NOW BEGAN TO ASCEND AND THERE MINGLED WITH THE LOOSE EARTH AND PIECES OF ROCK THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
1924-132574-0031 THE WOODS TOO HAD SUFFERED MUCH FROM THE BATTERIES ABOVE FOR HERE THE ENEMY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO SCREEN THEMSELVES FROM THE FIRE OF THE RAMPARTS MANY NOBLE TREES WERE LEVELLED WITH THE GROUND
1924-132574-0032 AND OTHERS TO A WIDE EXTENT WERE ENTIRELY STRIPPED OF THEIR UPPER BRANCHES WE HAD BETTER DISMOUNT SAID UGO AND LEAD THE MULES UP THE HILL
1924-132574-0033 HERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM GIVE ME THE TORCH CONTINUED UGO AFTER THEY HAD DISMOUNTED AND TAKE CARE YOU DON'T STUMBLE OVER ANY THING
1924-132574-0034 FOR THE GROUND IS NOT YET CLEARED OF THE ENEMY HOW EXCLAIMED EMILY ARE ANY OF THE ENEMY HERE THEN NAY I DON'T KNOW FOR THAT NOW HE REPLIED
1924-132574-0035 BUT WHEN I CAME AWAY I SAW ONE OR TWO OF THEM LYING UNDER THE TREES AS THEY PROCEEDED THE TORCH THREW A GLOOMY LIGHT UPON THE GROUND AND FAR AMONG THE RECESSES OF THE WOODS
1924-132574-0036 AND EMILY FEARED TO LOOK FORWARD LEST SOME OBJECT OF HORROR SHOULD MEET HER EYE THE PATH WAS OFTEN STREWN WITH BROKEN HEADS OF ARROWS AND WITH SHATTERED REMAINS OF ARMOUR
1924-132574-0037 BRING THE LIGHT HITHER SAID BERTRAND I HAVE STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING THAT RATTLES LOUD ENOUGH
1924-132574-0038 THEY PERCEIVED A STEEL BREASTPLATE ON THE GROUND WHICH BERTRAND RAISED AND THEY SAW THAT IT WAS PIERCED THROUGH AND THAT THE LINING WAS ENTIRELY COVERED WITH BLOOD
1924-132574-0039 BUT UPON EMILY'S EARNEST ENTREATIES THAT THEY WOULD PROCEED BERTRAND UTTERING SOME JOKE UPON THE UNFORTUNATE PERSON TO WHOM IT HAD BELONGED THREW IT HARD UPON THE GROUND AND THEY PASSED ON
1924-132574-0040 AT EVERY STEP SHE TOOK EMILY FEARED TO SEE SOME VESTIGE OF DEATH COMING SOON AFTER TO AN OPENING IN THE WOODS BERTRAND STOPPED TO SURVEY THE GROUND WHICH WAS ENCUMBERED WITH MASSY TRUNKS
1924-132574-0041 AND BRANCHES OF THE TREES THAT HAD SO LATELY ADORNED IT AND SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN A SPOT PARTICULARLY FATAL TO THE BESIEGERS FOR IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TREES
1924-132574-0042 WHOSE MANGLED FORMS EMILY ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE AND SHE AGAIN ENTREATED HER COMPANIONS TO PROCEED WHO WERE HOWEVER
1924-132574-0043 AND SHE TURNED HER EYES FROM THIS DESOLATED SCENE TO THE CASTLE ABOVE WHERE SHE OBSERVED LIGHTS GLIDING ALONG THE RAMPARTS PRESENTLY THE CASTLE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE
1924-132574-0044 AND THEN A TRUMPET SOUNDED OF WHICH EMILY ENQUIRED THE OCCASION O THEY ARE ONLY CHANGING WATCH REPLIED UGO I DO NOT REMEMBER THIS TRUMPET
1924-132574-0045 AFTER WHICH ALL WAS AGAIN STILL SHE COMPLAINED OF COLD AND BEGGED TO GO ON PRESENTLY LADY SAID BERTRAND TURNING OVER SOME BROKEN ARMS WITH THE PIKE HE USUALLY CARRIED
1924-132574-0046 WHAT HAVE WE HERE HARK CRIED EMILY WHAT NOISE WAS THAT WHAT NOISE WAS IT SAID UGO STARTING UP AND LISTENING HUSH REPEATED EMILY
1924-132574-0047 IT SURELY CAME FROM THE RAMPARTS ABOVE AND ON LOOKING UP THEY PERCEIVED A LIGHT MOVING ALONG THE WALLS WHILE IN THE NEXT INSTANT THE BREEZE SWELLING THE VOICE SOUNDED LOUDER THAN BEFORE
1924-132574-0048 AND HE BLEW A SHRILL WHISTLE WHICH SIGNAL WAS ANSWERED BY ANOTHER FROM THE SOLDIER ON WATCH AND THE PARTY THEN PASSING FORWARD SOON AFTER EMERGED FROM THE WOODS UPON THE BROKEN ROAD
1924-132574-0049 THAT LED IMMEDIATELY TO THE CASTLE GATES AND EMILY SAW WITH RENEWED TERROR THE WHOLE OF THAT STUPENDOUS STRUCTURE ALAS SAID SHE TO HERSELF I AM GOING AGAIN INTO MY PRISON
1924-132574-0050 HERE HAS BEEN WARM WORK BY SAINT MARCO CRIED BERTRAND WAVING A TORCH OVER THE GROUND THE BALLS HAVE TORN UP THE EARTH HERE WITH A VENGEANCE
1924-132574-0051 FOR BESIDES THE CANNON FROM THE WALLS OUR ARCHERS ON THE TWO ROUND TOWERS SHOWERED DOWN UPON THEM AT SUCH A RATE THAT BY HOLY PETER THERE WAS NO STANDING IT I NEVER SAW A BETTER SIGHT IN MY LIFE
1924-132574-0052 BERTRAND MY GOOD FELLOW THOU SHOULDST HAVE BEEN AMONG THEM I WARRANT THOU WOULDST HAVE WON THE RACE HAH YOU ARE AT YOUR OLD TRICKS AGAIN
1924-132574-0053 THOU KNOWEST I HAVE KILLED MY MAN BEFORE NOW
1924-132574-0054 AND THEN GAVE SOME FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE SIEGE TO WHICH AS EMILY LISTENED SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE STRONG CONTRAST OF THE PRESENT SCENE WITH THAT WHICH HAD SO LATELY BEEN ACTED HERE
1924-132574-0055 THE GROANS OF THE CONQUERED AND THE SHOUTS OF THE CONQUERORS WERE NOW SUNK INTO A SILENCE SO PROFOUND THAT IT SEEMED AS IF DEATH HAD TRIUMPHED ALIKE OVER THE VANQUISHED AND THE VICTOR
1924-132574-0056 THE SHATTERED CONDITION OF ONE OF THE TOWERS OF THE GREAT GATES BY NO MEANS CONFIRMED THE VALIANT ACCOUNT JUST GIVEN BY UGO OF THE SCAMPERING PARTY WHO IT WAS EVIDENT HAD NOT ONLY MADE A STAND
1924-132574-0057 BUT HAD DONE MUCH MISCHIEF BEFORE THEY TOOK TO FLIGHT FOR THIS TOWER APPEARED AS FAR AS EMILY COULD JUDGE BY THE DIM MOON LIGHT THAT FELL UPON
1924-132574-0058 AND THE BATTLEMENTS WERE NEARLY DEMOLISHED WHILE SHE GAZED A LIGHT GLIMMERED THROUGH ONE OF THE LOWER LOOP HOLES AND DISAPPEARED
1924-132574-0059 SHE PERCEIVED THROUGH THE BROKEN WALL A SOLDIER WITH A LAMP ASCENDING THE NARROW STAIRCASE THAT WOUND WITHIN THE TOWER AND REMEMBERING THAT IT WAS THE SAME SHE HAD PASSED UP ON THE NIGHT WHEN BARNARDINE
1924-132574-0060 THE LAMP HE CARRIED GAVE HER A DUSKY VIEW OF THAT TERRIBLE APARTMENT AND SHE ALMOST SUNK UNDER THE RECOLLECTED HORRORS OF THE MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD DRAWN ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND DISCOVERED THE OBJECT IT WAS MEANT TO CONCEAL
1924-132574-0061 PERHAPS THAT SOLDIER GOES AT THIS DEAD HOUR TO WATCH OVER THE CORPSE OF HIS FRIEND THE LITTLE REMAINS OF HER FORTITUDE NOW GAVE WAY TO THE UNITED FORCE OF REMEMBERED AND ANTICIPATED HORRORS
1924-132574-0062 FOR THE MELANCHOLY FATE OF MADAME MONTONI APPEARED TO FORETELL HER OWN SHE CONSIDERED THAT
1924-132574-0063 THEY MIGHT NOT APPEASE HIS VENGEANCE WHICH WAS SELDOM PACIFIED BUT BY A TERRIBLE SACRIFICE
1924-132574-0064 THAT WERE SHE TO RESIGN THEM THE FEAR OF JUSTICE MIGHT URGE HIM EITHER TO DETAIN HER A PRISONER OR TO TAKE AWAY HER LIFE THEY WERE NOW ARRIVED AT THE GATES WHERE BERTRAND
1924-132574-0065 CALLED ALOUD AND THE SOLDIER LOOKING OUT DEMANDED WHO WAS THERE HERE I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A PRISONER SAID UGO OPEN THE GATE AND LET US IN TELL ME FIRST WHO IT IS THAT DEMANDS ENTRANCE
1924-132574-0066 REPLIED THE SOLDIER WHAT MY OLD COMRADE CRIED UGO DON'T YOU KNOW ME NOT KNOW UGO I HAVE BROUGHT HOME A PRISONER HERE BOUND HAND AND FOOT A FELLOW WHO HAS BEEN DRINKING TUSCANY WINE
1924-132574-0067 WHILE WE HERE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING YOU WILL NOT REST TILL YOU MEET WITH YOUR MATCH SAID BERTRAND SULLENLY HAH MY COMRADE IS IT YOU SAID THE SOLDIER
1924-132574-0068 AND THEN THE HEAVY CHAIN FALL AND THE BOLTS UNDRAW OF A SMALL POSTERN DOOR WHICH HE OPENED TO ADMIT THE PARTY HE HELD THE LAMP LOW TO SHEW THE STEP OF THE GATE
1924-132574-0069 AND SHE FOUND HERSELF ONCE MORE BENEATH THE GLOOMY ARCH AND HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE THAT SEEMED TO SHUT HER FROM THE WORLD FOR EVER IN THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS IN THE FIRST COURT OF THE CASTLE
1924-132574-0070 AS UGO AND THE SOLDIER CONVERSED TOGETHER ASSISTED TO INCREASE THE MELANCHOLY FOREBODINGS OF HER HEART PASSING ON TO THE SECOND COURT A DISTANT SOUND BROKE FEEBLY ON THE SILENCE
1924-132574-0071 AND GRADUALLY SWELLING LOUDER AS THEY ADVANCED EMILY DISTINGUISHED VOICES OF REVELRY AND LAUGHTER BUT THEY WERE TO HER FAR OTHER THAN SOUNDS OF JOY
1924-132574-0072 IF ONE MAY JUDGE BY THE UPROAR THAT IS GOING FORWARD
1924-132574-0073 WHO IS CAROUSING AT THIS LATE HOUR HIS EXCELLENZA AND THE SIGNORS REPLIED THE SOLDIER IT IS A SIGN YOU ARE A STRANGER AT THE CASTLE OR YOU WOULD NOT NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION THEY ARE BRAVE SPIRITS THAT DO WITHOUT SLEEP
1924-132574-0074 THEY GENERALLY PASS THE NIGHT IN GOOD CHEER WOULD THAT WE WHO KEEP THE WATCH HAD A LITTLE OF IT IT IS COLD WORK PACING THE RAMPARTS SO MANY HOURS OF THE NIGHT IF ONE HAS NO GOOD LIQUOR TO WARM ONE'S HEART
1924-132574-0075 COURAGE MY LAD COURAGE OUGHT TO WARM YOUR HEART SAID UGO COURAGE REPLIED THE SOLDIER SHARPLY WITH A MENACING AIR WHICH UGO PERCEIVING PREVENTED HIS SAYING MORE BY RETURNING TO THE SUBJECT OF THE CAROUSAL
1924-132574-0076 THIS IS A NEW CUSTOM SAID HE WHEN I LEFT THE CASTLE THE SIGNORS USED TO SIT UP COUNSELLING AYE AND FOR THAT MATTER CAROUSING TOO REPLIED THE SOLDIER BUT SINCE THE SIEGE THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT MAKE MERRY
1924-132574-0077 AND IF I WAS THEY I WOULD SETTLE ACCOUNTS WITH MYSELF
