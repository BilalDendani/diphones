444-139735-0000 I DECLARE I'VE CLEAN FORGOTTEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE CART SAID JOHN HE WAS ASLEEP AMONG THE STRAW THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM I'VE
444-139735-0001 VERY NEARLY REMEMBERED HIM TWICE SINCE I CAME IN BUT HE WENT OUT OF MY HEAD AGAIN
444-139735-0002 ROUSE UP THAT'S MY HEARTY JOHN SAID THESE LATTER WORDS OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHITHER HE HAD HURRIED WITH THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND MISS SLOWBOY CONSCIOUS OF SOME MYSTERIOUS REFERENCE TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND CONNECTING IN HER MYSTIFIED IMAGINATION
444-139735-0003 CERTAIN ASSOCIATIONS OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE WITH THE PHRASE WAS SO DISTURBED THAT HASTILY RISING FROM THE LOW CHAIR BY THE FIRE TO SEEK PROTECTION NEAR THE SKIRT OF HER MISTRESS AND COMING INTO CONTACT AS SHE CROSSED THE DOORWAY WITH AN ANCIENT STRANGER
444-139735-0004 SHE INSTINCTIVELY MADE A CHARGE OR BUTT AT HIM WITH THE ONLY OFFENSIVE INSTRUMENT WITHIN HER REACH THIS INSTRUMENT HAPPENING TO BE THE BABY GREAT COMMOTION AND ALARM ENSUED WHICH THE SAGACITY OF BOXER RATHER TENDED TO INCREASE
444-139735-0005 FOR THAT GOOD DOG MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN HIS MASTER HAD IT SEEMED BEEN WATCHING THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS SLEEP LEST HE SHOULD WALK OFF WITH A FEW YOUNG POPLAR TREES THAT WERE TIED UP BEHIND THE CART
444-139735-0006 AND HE STILL ATTENDED ON HIM VERY CLOSELY WORRYING HIS GAITERS IN FACT AND MAKING DEAD SETS AT THE BUTTONS YOU'RE SUCH AN UNDENIABLY GOOD SLEEPER SIR SAID JOHN WHEN TRANQUILLITY WAS RESTORED
444-139735-0007 IN THE MEANTIME THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD STOOD BAREHEADED AND MOTIONLESS IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
