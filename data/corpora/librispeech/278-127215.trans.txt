278-127215-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN MOUNT OLYMPUS WRETCHED IN SPIRIT GROANING UNDER THE FEELING OF INSULT SELF CONDEMNING AND ILL SATISFIED IN EVERY WAY BOLD RETURNED TO HIS LONDON LODGINGS
278-127215-0001 ILL AS HE HAD FARED IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE ARCHDEACON HE WAS NOT THE LESS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF CARRYING OUT HIS PLEDGE TO ELEANOR AND HE WENT ABOUT HIS UNGRACIOUS TASK WITH A HEAVY HEART THE ATTORNEYS WHOM HE HAD EMPLOYED IN LONDON
278-127215-0002 RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS WITH SURPRISE AND EVIDENT MISGIVING HOWEVER THEY COULD ONLY OBEY AND MUTTER SOMETHING OF THEIR SORROW THAT SUCH HEAVY COSTS SHOULD ONLY FALL UPON THEIR OWN EMPLOYER
278-127215-0003 ESPECIALLY AS NOTHING WAS WANTING BUT PERSEVERANCE TO THROW THEM ON THE OPPOSITE PARTY BOLD LEFT THE OFFICE WHICH HE HAD LATTERLY SO MUCH FREQUENTED SHAKING THE DUST FROM OFF HIS FEET AND BEFORE HE WAS DOWN THE STAIRS
278-127215-0004 HAD ALREADY GONE FORTH FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE BILL HE NEXT THOUGHT OF THE NEWSPAPERS THE CASE HAD BEEN TAKEN UP BY MORE THAN ONE
278-127215-0005 HE HAD BEEN VERY INTIMATE WITH TOM TOWERS AND HAD OFTEN DISCUSSED WITH HIM THE AFFAIRS OF THE HOSPITAL BOLD COULD NOT SAY THAT THE ARTICLES IN THAT PAPER HAD BEEN WRITTEN AT HIS OWN INSTIGATION
278-127215-0006 HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AS A FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY HIS FRIEND TOM TOWERS HAD NEVER SAID THAT SUCH A VIEW OF THE CASE OR SUCH A SIDE IN THE DISPUTE WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE PAPER WITH WHICH HE WAS CONNECTED
278-127215-0007 VERY DISCREET IN SUCH MATTERS WAS TOM TOWERS AND ALTOGETHER INDISPOSED TO TALK LOOSELY OF THE CONCERNS
278-127215-0008 NEVERTHELESS BOLD BELIEVED THAT TO HIM WERE OWING THOSE DREADFUL WORDS WHICH HAD CAUSED SUCH PANIC AT BARCHESTER AND HE CONCEIVED HIMSELF BOUND TO PREVENT THEIR REPETITION WITH THIS VIEW HE BETOOK HIMSELF FROM THE ATTORNEYS OFFICE
278-127215-0009 WHERE WITH AMAZING CHEMISTRY TOM TOWERS COMPOUNDED THUNDERBOLTS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL THAT IS EVIL AND FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THIS AND OTHER HEMISPHERES WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF MOUNT OLYMPUS
278-127215-0010 THAT HIGH ABODE OF ALL THE POWERS OF TYPE THAT FAVOURED SEAT OF THE GREAT GODDESS PICA THAT WONDROUS HABITATION OF GODS AND DEVILS FROM WHENCE WITH CEASELESS HUM OF STEAM AND NEVER ENDING FLOW OF CASTALIAN INK
278-127215-0011 ISSUE FORTH FIFTY THOUSAND NIGHTLY EDICTS FOR THE GOVERNANCE OF A SUBJECT NATION VELVET AND GILDING DO NOT MAKE A THRONE NOR GOLD AND JEWELS A SCEPTRE IT IS A THRONE BECAUSE THE MOST EXALTED ONE SITS THERE
278-127215-0012 AND A SCEPTRE BECAUSE THE MOST MIGHTY ONE WIELDS IT SO IT IS WITH MOUNT OLYMPUS SHOULD A STRANGER MAKE HIS WAY THITHER AT DULL NOONDAY OR DURING THE SLEEPY HOURS OF THE SILENT AFTERNOON
278-127215-0013 HE WOULD FIND NO ACKNOWLEDGED TEMPLE OF POWER AND BEAUTY NO FITTING FANE FOR THE GREAT THUNDERER NO PROUD FACADES AND PILLARED ROOFS TO SUPPORT THE DIGNITY OF THIS GREATEST OF EARTHLY POTENTATES
278-127215-0014 TO THE OUTWARD AND UNINITIATED EYE MOUNT OLYMPUS IS A SOMEWHAT HUMBLE SPOT UNDISTINGUISHED UNADORNED NAY ALMOST MEAN IT STANDS ALONE AS IT WERE IN A MIGHTY CITY
278-127215-0015 CLOSE TO THE DENSEST THRONG OF MEN BUT PARTAKING NEITHER OF THE NOISE NOR THE CROWD A SMALL SECLUDED DREARY SPOT TENANTED ONE WOULD SAY BY QUITE UNAMBITIOUS PEOPLE AT THE EASIEST RENTS
278-127215-0016 IS THIS MOUNT OLYMPUS ASKS THE UNBELIEVING STRANGER IS IT FROM THESE SMALL DARK DINGY BUILDINGS THAT THOSE INFALLIBLE LAWS PROCEED WHICH CABINETS ARE CALLED UPON TO OBEY BY WHICH BISHOPS ARE TO BE GUIDED
278-127215-0017 LORDS AND COMMONS CONTROLLED JUDGES INSTRUCTED IN LAW GENERALS IN STRATEGY ADMIRALS IN NAVAL TACTICS AND ORANGE WOMEN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR BARROWS YES MY FRIEND FROM THESE WALLS
278-127215-0018 FROM HERE ISSUE THE ONLY KNOWN INFALLIBLE BULLS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF BRITISH SOULS AND BODIES THIS LITTLE COURT IS THE VATICAN OF ENGLAND HERE REIGNS A POPE SELF NOMINATED SELF CONSECRATED
278-127215-0019 AY AND MUCH STRANGER TOO SELF BELIEVING A POPE WHOM IF YOU CANNOT OBEY HIM I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO DISOBEY AS SILENTLY AS POSSIBLE A POPE HITHERTO AFRAID OF NO LUTHER
278-127215-0020 A POPE WHO MANAGES HIS OWN INQUISITION WHO PUNISHES UNBELIEVERS AS NO MOST SKILFUL INQUISITOR OF SPAIN EVER DREAMT OF DOING ONE WHO CAN EXCOMMUNICATE THOROUGHLY FEARFULLY RADICALLY

278-127215-0022 IT IS A FACT AMAZING TO ORDINARY MORTALS THAT THE JUPITER IS NEVER WRONG WITH WHAT ENDLESS CARE WITH WHAT UNSPARING LABOUR DO WE NOT STRIVE TO GET TOGETHER FOR OUR GREAT NATIONAL COUNCIL
278-127215-0023 THE MEN MOST FITTING TO COMPOSE IT AND HOW WE FAIL PARLIAMENT IS ALWAYS WRONG LOOK AT THE JUPITER AND SEE HOW FUTILE ARE THEIR MEETINGS HOW VAIN THEIR COUNCIL
278-127215-0024 HOW NEEDLESS ALL THEIR TROUBLE WITH WHAT PRIDE DO WE REGARD OUR CHIEF MINISTERS THE GREAT SERVANTS OF STATE THE OLIGARCHS OF THE NATION ON WHOSE WISDOM WE LEAN
278-127215-0025 TO WHOM WE LOOK FOR GUIDANCE IN OUR DIFFICULTIES BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO THE WRITERS OF THE JUPITER THEY HOLD COUNCIL TOGETHER AND WITH ANXIOUS THOUGHT PAINFULLY ELABORATE THEIR COUNTRY'S GOOD
278-127215-0026 BUT WHEN ALL IS DONE THE JUPITER DECLARES THAT ALL IS NAUGHT WHY SHOULD WE LOOK TO LORD JOHN RUSSELL WHY SHOULD WE REGARD PALMERSTON AND GLADSTONE WHEN TOM TOWERS WITHOUT A STRUGGLE CAN PUT US RIGHT
278-127215-0027 LOOK AT OUR GENERALS WHAT FAULTS THEY MAKE AT OUR ADMIRALS HOW INACTIVE THEY ARE WHAT MONEY HONESTY AND SCIENCE CAN DO IS DONE AND YET HOW BADLY ARE OUR TROOPS BROUGHT TOGETHER FED CONVEYED
278-127215-0028 CLOTHED ARMED AND MANAGED THE MOST EXCELLENT OF OUR GOOD MEN DO THEIR BEST TO MAN OUR SHIPS WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ALL POSSIBLE EXTERNAL APPLIANCES BUT IN VAIN ALL ALL IS WRONG
278-127215-0029 ALAS ALAS TOM TOWERS AND HE ALONE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT WHY OH WHY YE EARTHLY MINISTERS WHY HAVE YE NOT FOLLOWED MORE CLOSELY THIS HEAVEN SENT MESSENGER THAT IS AMONG US
278-127215-0030 WERE IT NOT WELL FOR US IN OUR IGNORANCE THAT WE CONFIDED ALL THINGS TO THE JUPITER WOULD IT NOT BE WISE IN US TO ABANDON USELESS TALKING IDLE THINKING AND PROFITLESS LABOUR
278-127215-0031 WITH VERDICTS FROM JUDICIAL BENCH GIVEN AFTER MUCH DELAY WITH DOUBTFUL LAWS AND THE FALLIBLE ATTEMPTS OF HUMANITY
278-127215-0032 DOES NOT THE JUPITER COMING FORTH DAILY WITH FIFTY THOUSAND IMPRESSIONS FULL OF UNERRING DECISION ON EVERY MORTAL SUBJECT SET ALL MATTERS SUFFICIENTLY AT REST IS NOT TOM TOWERS HERE ABLE TO GUIDE US AND WILLING
278-127215-0033 YES INDEED ABLE AND WILLING TO GUIDE ALL MEN IN ALL THINGS SO LONG AS HE IS OBEYED AS AUTOCRAT SHOULD BE OBEYED WITH UNDOUBTING SUBMISSION
278-127215-0034 ONLY LET NOT UNGRATEFUL MINISTERS SEEK OTHER COLLEAGUES THAN THOSE WHOM TOM TOWERS MAY APPROVE LET CHURCH AND STATE LAW AND PHYSIC COMMERCE AND AGRICULTURE THE ARTS OF WAR AND THE ARTS OF PEACE
278-127215-0035 ALL LISTEN AND OBEY AND ALL WILL BE MADE PERFECT HAS NOT TOM TOWERS AN ALL SEEING EYE FROM THE DIGGINGS OF AUSTRALIA TO THOSE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT ROUND THE HABITABLE GLOBE
278-127215-0036 DOES HE NOT KNOW WATCH AND CHRONICLE THE DOINGS OF EVERYONE FROM A BISHOPRIC IN NEW ZEALAND TO AN UNFORTUNATE DIRECTOR OF A NORTH WEST PASSAGE IS HE NOT THE ONLY FIT JUDGE OF CAPABILITY
278-127215-0037 FROM THE SEWERS OF LONDON TO THE CENTRAL RAILWAY OF INDIA FROM THE PALACES OF SAINT PETERSBURG TO THE CABINS OF CONNAUGHT NOTHING CAN ESCAPE HIM BRITONS HAVE BUT TO READ TO OBEY AND BE BLESSED
278-127215-0038 NONE BUT THE FOOLS DOUBT THE WISDOM OF THE JUPITER NONE BUT THE MAD DISPUTE ITS FACTS NO ESTABLISHED RELIGION HAS EVER BEEN WITHOUT ITS UNBELIEVERS EVEN IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT IS THE MOST FIRMLY FIXED
278-127215-0039 NO CREED HAS BEEN WITHOUT SCOFFERS NO CHURCH HAS SO PROSPERED AS TO FREE ITSELF ENTIRELY FROM DISSENT THERE ARE THOSE WHO DOUBT THE JUPITER THEY LIVE AND BREATHE THE UPPER AIR WALKING HERE UNSCATHED
278-127215-0040 THOUGH SCORNED MEN BORN OF BRITISH MOTHERS AND NURSED ON ENGLISH MILK WHO SCRUPLE NOT TO SAY THAT MOUNT OLYMPUS HAS ITS PRICE THAT TOM TOWERS CAN BE BOUGHT FOR GOLD SUCH IS MOUNT OLYMPUS
278-127215-0041 THE MOUTHPIECE OF ALL THE WISDOM OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY IT MAY PROBABLY BE SAID THAT NO PLACE IN THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY IS MORE WORTHY OF NOTICE NO TREASURY MANDATE ARMED WITH THE SIGNATURES OF ALL THE GOVERNMENT
278-127215-0042 HAS HALF THE POWER OF ONE OF THOSE BROAD SHEETS WHICH FLY FORTH FROM HENCE SO ABUNDANTLY ARMED WITH NO SIGNATURE AT ALL SOME GREAT MAN SOME MIGHTY PEER WE'LL SAY A NOBLE DUKE
278-127215-0043 RETIRES TO REST FEARED AND HONOURED BY ALL HIS COUNTRYMEN FEARLESS HIMSELF IF NOT A GOOD MAN AT ANY RATE A MIGHTY MAN TOO MIGHTY TO CARE MUCH WHAT MEN MAY SAY ABOUT HIS WANT OF VIRTUE
278-127215-0044 HE RISES IN THE MORNING DEGRADED MEAN AND MISERABLE AN OBJECT OF MEN'S SCORN ANXIOUS ONLY TO RETIRE AS QUICKLY AS MAY BE TO SOME GERMAN OBSCURITY SOME UNSEEN ITALIAN PRIVACY OR INDEED ANYWHERE OUT OF SIGHT
278-127215-0045 WHAT HAS MADE THIS AWFUL CHANGE WHAT HAS SO AFFLICTED HIM AN ARTICLE HAS APPEARED IN THE JUPITER SOME FIFTY LINES OF A NARROW COLUMN HAVE DESTROYED ALL HIS GRACE'S EQUANIMITY AND BANISHED HIM FOR EVER FROM THE WORLD
278-127215-0046 NO MAN KNOWS WHO WROTE THE BITTER WORDS THE CLUBS TALK CONFUSEDLY OF THE MATTER WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER THIS AND THAT NAME WHILE TOM TOWERS WALKS QUIETLY ALONG PALL MALL WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED CLOSE AGAINST THE EAST WIND
278-127215-0047 CONSIDERING WITHIN HIMSELF WHETHER BY ANY STRETCH OF THE POWERS WITHIN HIM HE COULD EVER COME TO SUCH DISTINCTION WONDERING HOW TOM TOWERS WOULD TAKE ANY LITTLE HUMBLE OFFERING OF HIS TALENTS CALCULATING THAT TOM TOWERS HIMSELF
278-127215-0048 MUST HAVE ONCE HAD A BEGINNING HAVE ONCE DOUBTED AS TO HIS OWN SUCCESS TOWERS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORN A WRITER IN THE JUPITER WITH SUCH IDEAS HALF AMBITIOUS AND HALF AWE STRUCK HAD BOLD REGARDED THE SILENT LOOKING WORKSHOP OF THE GODS
278-127215-0049 BUT HE HAD NEVER YET BY WORD OR SIGN ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE THE SLIGHTEST WORD OF HIS UNERRING FRIEND ON SUCH A COURSE WAS HE NOW INTENT AND NOT WITHOUT MUCH INWARD PALPITATION
278-127215-0050 DID HE BETAKE HIMSELF TO THE QUIET ABODE OF WISDOM WHERE TOM TOWERS WAS TO BE FOUND O MORNINGS INHALING AMBROSIA AND SIPPING NECTAR IN THE SHAPE OF TOAST AND TEA NOT FAR REMOVED FROM MOUNT OLYMPUS
278-127215-0051 WASHED BY THE RICH TIDE WHICH NOW PASSES FROM THE TOWERS OF CAESAR TO BARRY'S HALLS OF ELOQUENCE
278-127215-0052 WITH NEW OFFERINGS OF A CITY'S TRIBUTE FROM THE PALACES OF PEERS TO THE MART OF MERCHANTS
278-127215-0053 WHAT A WORLD WITHIN A WORLD IS THE TEMPLE HOW QUIET ARE ITS ENTANGLED WALKS AS SOMEONE LATELY HAS CALLED THEM AND YET HOW CLOSE TO THE DENSEST CONCOURSE OF HUMANITY HOW GRAVELY RESPECTABLE ITS SOBER ALLEYS
278-127215-0054 THOUGH REMOVED BUT BY A SINGLE STEP FROM THE PROFANITY OF THE STRAND AND THE LOW INIQUITY OF FLEET STREET OLD SAINT DUNSTAN WITH ITS BELL SMITING BLUDGEONERS HAS BEEN REMOVED
278-127215-0055 THE ANCIENT SHOPS WITH THEIR FACES FULL OF PLEASANT HISTORY ARE PASSING AWAY ONE BY ONE THE BAR ITSELF IS TO GO ITS DOOM HAS BEEN PRONOUNCED BY THE JUPITER RUMOUR TELLS US OF SOME HUGE BUILDING
278-127215-0056 SUBVERSIVE OF THE COURTS OF WESTMINSTER AND ANTAGONISTIC TO THE ROLLS AND LINCOLN'S INN BUT NOTHING YET THREATENS THE SILENT BEAUTY OF THE TEMPLE IT IS THE MEDIAEVAL COURT OF THE METROPOLIS
278-127215-0057 HERE ON THE CHOICEST SPOT OF THIS CHOICE GROUND STANDS A LOFTY ROW OF CHAMBERS LOOKING OBLIQUELY UPON THE SULLIED THAMES
278-127215-0058 BEFORE THE WINDOWS THE LAWN OF THE TEMPLE GARDENS STRETCHES WITH THAT DIM YET DELICIOUS VERDURE SO REFRESHING TO THE EYES OF LONDONERS IF DOOMED TO LIVE WITHIN THE THICKEST OF LONDON SMOKE
278-127215-0059 YOU WOULD SURELY SAY THAT THAT WOULD BE YOUR CHOSEN SPOT YES YOU YOU WHOM I NOW ADDRESS MY DEAR MIDDLE AGED BACHELOR FRIEND CAN NOWHERE BE SO WELL DOMICILED AS HERE
278-127215-0060 NO ONE HERE WILL ASK WHETHER YOU ARE OUT OR AT HOME ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS HERE NO SABBATARIAN WILL INVESTIGATE YOUR SUNDAYS NO CENSORIOUS LANDLADY WILL SCRUTINISE YOUR EMPTY BOTTLE
278-127215-0061 NO VALETUDINARIAN NEIGHBOUR WILL COMPLAIN OF LATE HOURS IF YOU LOVE BOOKS TO WHAT PLACE ARE BOOKS SO SUITABLE THE WHOLE SPOT IS REDOLENT OF TYPOGRAPHY
278-127215-0062 THE GROVES OF CYPRUS ARE NOT MORE TACITURN THAN THOSE OF THE TEMPLE WIT AND WINE ARE ALWAYS HERE AND ALWAYS TOGETHER THE REVELS OF THE TEMPLE ARE AS THOSE OF POLISHED GREECE
278-127215-0063 WHERE THE WILDEST WORSHIPPER OF BACCHUS NEVER FORGOT THE DIGNITY OF THE GOD WHOM HE ADORED WHERE CAN RETIREMENT BE SO COMPLETE AS HERE WHERE CAN YOU BE SO SURE OF ALL THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY
278-127215-0064 IT WAS HERE THAT TOM TOWERS LIVED AND CULTIVATED WITH EMINENT SUCCESS THE TENTH MUSE WHO NOW GOVERNS THE PERIODICAL PRESS BUT LET IT NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT HIS CHAMBERS WERE SUCH
278-127215-0065 OR SO COMFORTLESS AS ARE FREQUENTLY THE GAUNT ABODES OF LEGAL ASPIRANTS FOUR CHAIRS
278-127215-0066 AN OLD OFFICE TABLE COVERED WITH DUSTY PAPERS WHICH ARE NOT MOVED ONCE IN SIX MONTHS AND AN OLDER PEMBROKE BROTHER WITH RICKETY LEGS FOR ALL DAILY USES A DESPATCHER FOR THE PREPARATION OF LOBSTERS AND COFFEE
278-127215-0067 AND AN APPARATUS FOR THE COOKING OF TOAST AND MUTTON CHOPS SUCH UTENSILS AND LUXURIES AS THESE DID NOT SUFFICE FOR THE WELL BEING OF TOM TOWERS HE INDULGED IN FOUR ROOMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR
278-127215-0068 EACH OF WHICH WAS FURNISHED IF NOT WITH THE SPLENDOUR WITH PROBABLY MORE THAN THE COMFORT OF STAFFORD HOUSE EVERY ADDITION THAT SCIENCE AND ART HAVE LATELY MADE TO THE LUXURIES OF MODERN LIFE WAS TO BE FOUND THERE
278-127215-0069 THE ROOM IN WHICH HE USUALLY SAT WAS SURROUNDED BY BOOK SHELVES CAREFULLY FILLED NOR WAS THERE A VOLUME THERE WHICH WAS NOT ENTITLED TO ITS PLACE IN SUCH A COLLECTION BOTH BY ITS INTRINSIC WORTH AND EXTERIOR SPLENDOUR
278-127215-0070 A PRETTY PORTABLE SET OF STEPS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM SHOWED THAT THOSE EVEN ON THE HIGHER SHELVES WERE INTENDED FOR USE THE CHAMBER CONTAINED BUT TWO WORKS OF ART
278-127215-0071 THE ONE AN ADMIRABLE BUST OF SIR ROBERT PEEL BY POWER DECLARED THE INDIVIDUAL POLITICS OF OUR FRIEND AND THE OTHER A SINGULARLY LONG FIGURE OF A FEMALE DEVOTEE
278-127215-0072 TOLD EQUALLY PLAINLY THE SCHOOL OF ART TO WHICH HE WAS ADDICTED THIS PICTURE WAS NOT HUNG AS PICTURES USUALLY ARE AGAINST THE WALL THERE WAS NO INCH OF WALL VACANT FOR SUCH A PURPOSE
278-127215-0073 IT HAD A STAND OR DESK ERECTED FOR ITS OWN ACCOMMODATION AND THERE ON HER PEDESTAL FRAMED AND GLAZED STOOD THE DEVOTIONAL LADY LOOKING INTENTLY AT A LILY AS NO LADY EVER LOOKED BEFORE
278-127215-0074 OUR MODERN ARTISTS WHOM WE STYLE PRE RAPHAELITES HAVE DELIGHTED TO GO BACK NOT ONLY TO THE FINISH AND PECULIAR MANNER BUT ALSO TO THE SUBJECTS OF THE EARLY PAINTERS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE THEM TOO MUCH PRAISE
278-127215-0075 OF THE MASTERS FROM WHOM THEY TAKE THEIR INSPIRATION NOTHING PROBABLY CAN EXCEED THE PAINTING OF SOME OF THESE LATTER DAY PICTURES IT IS HOWEVER SINGULAR INTO WHAT FAULTS THEY FALL AS REGARDS THEIR SUBJECTS
278-127215-0076 THEY ARE NOT QUITE CONTENT TO TAKE THE OLD STOCK GROUPS A SEBASTIAN WITH HIS ARROWS
278-127215-0077 BUT THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT HAPPY IN THEIR CHANGE AS A RULE NO FIGURE SHOULD BE DRAWN IN A POSITION WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPOSE ANY FIGURE SHOULD MAINTAIN THE PATIENT ENDURANCE OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
278-127215-0078 THE WILD ECSTASY OF SAINT JOHN IN THE WILDERNESS THE MATERNAL LOVE OF THE VIRGIN ARE FEELINGS NATURALLY PORTRAYED BY A FIXED POSTURE BUT THE LADY WITH THE STIFF BACK AND BENT NECK WHO LOOKS AT HER FLOWER
278-127215-0079 AND IS STILL LOOKING FROM HOUR TO HOUR GIVES US AN IDEA OF PAIN WITHOUT GRACE AND ABSTRACTION WITHOUT A CAUSE IT WAS EASY FROM HIS ROOMS TO SEE THAT TOM TOWERS WAS A SYBARITE THOUGH BY NO MEANS AN IDLE ONE
278-127215-0080 HE WAS LINGERING OVER HIS LAST CUP OF TEA SURROUNDED BY AN OCEAN OF NEWSPAPERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD BEEN SWIMMING WHEN JOHN BOLD'S CARD WAS BROUGHT IN BY HIS TIGER THIS TIGER NEVER KNEW THAT HIS MASTER WAS AT HOME
278-127215-0081 THOUGH HE OFTEN KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT AND THUS TOM TOWERS WAS NEVER INVADED BUT BY HIS OWN CONSENT ON THIS OCCASION AFTER TWISTING THE CARD TWICE IN HIS FINGERS HE SIGNIFIED TO HIS ATTENDANT IMP THAT HE WAS VISIBLE
278-127215-0082 AND THE INNER DOOR WAS UNBOLTED AND OUR FRIEND ANNOUNCED I HAVE BEFORE SAID THAT HE OF THE JUPITER AND JOHN BOLD WERE INTIMATE THERE WAS NO VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THEIR AGES FOR TOWERS WAS STILL CONSIDERABLY UNDER FORTY
278-127215-0083 AND WHEN BOLD HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE LONDON HOSPITALS TOWERS WHO WAS NOT THEN THE GREAT MAN THAT HE HAD SINCE BECOME HAD BEEN MUCH WITH HIM THEN THEY HAD OFTEN DISCUSSED TOGETHER THE OBJECTS OF THEIR AMBITION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
278-127215-0084 THEN TOM TOWERS WAS STRUGGLING HARD TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF AS A BRIEFLESS BARRISTER BY SHORTHAND REPORTING FOR ANY OF THE PAPERS THAT WOULD ENGAGE HIM THEN HE HAD NOT DARED TO DREAM OF WRITING LEADERS FOR THE JUPITER
278-127215-0085 OR CANVASSING THE CONDUCT OF CABINET MINISTERS THINGS HAD ALTERED SINCE THAT TIME THE BRIEFLESS BARRISTER WAS STILL BRIEFLESS BUT HE NOW DESPISED BRIEFS COULD HE HAVE BEEN SURE OF A JUDGE'S SEAT
278-127215-0086 HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE LEFT HIS PRESENT CAREER IT IS TRUE HE WORE NO ERMINE BORE NO OUTWARD MARKS OF A WORLD'S RESPECT BUT WITH WHAT A LOAD OF INWARD IMPORTANCE WAS HE CHARGED
278-127215-0087 IT IS TRUE HIS NAME APPEARED IN NO LARGE CAPITALS ON NO WALL WAS CHALKED UP TOM TOWERS FOR EVER FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND TOM TOWERS BUT WHAT MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT HAD HALF HIS POWER
278-127215-0088 IT IS TRUE THAT IN FAR OFF PROVINCES MEN DID NOT TALK DAILY OF TOM TOWERS BUT THEY READ THE JUPITER AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WITHOUT THE JUPITER
278-127215-0089 THIS KIND OF HIDDEN BUT STILL CONSCIOUS GLORY SUITED THE NATURE OF THE MAN HE LOVED TO SIT SILENT IN A CORNER OF HIS CLUB AND LISTEN TO THE LOUD CHATTERING OF POLITICIANS
278-127215-0090 HOW HE COULD SMITE THE LOUDEST OF THEM WERE IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO RAISE HIS PEN FOR SUCH A PURPOSE HE LOVED TO WATCH THE GREAT MEN OF WHOM HE DAILY WROTE AND FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE WAS GREATER THAN ANY OF THEM
278-127215-0091 EACH OF THEM WAS RESPONSIBLE TO HIS COUNTRY EACH OF THEM MUST ANSWER IF INQUIRED INTO EACH OF THEM MUST ENDURE ABUSE WITH GOOD HUMOUR AND INSOLENCE WITHOUT ANGER BUT TO WHOM WAS HE TOM TOWERS RESPONSIBLE
278-127215-0092 NO ONE COULD INSULT HIM NO ONE COULD INQUIRE INTO HIM HE COULD SPEAK OUT WITHERING WORDS AND NO ONE COULD ANSWER HIM MINISTERS COURTED HIM THOUGH PERHAPS THEY KNEW NOT HIS NAME BISHOPS FEARED HIM
278-127215-0093 JUDGES DOUBTED THEIR OWN VERDICTS UNLESS HE CONFIRMED THEM AND GENERALS IN THEIR COUNCILS OF WAR DID NOT CONSIDER MORE DEEPLY WHAT THE ENEMY WOULD DO THAN WHAT THE JUPITER WOULD SAY TOM TOWERS NEVER BOASTED OF THE JUPITER
278-127215-0094 HE SCARCELY EVER NAMED THE PAPER EVEN TO THE MOST INTIMATE OF HIS FRIENDS HE DID NOT EVEN WISH TO BE SPOKEN OF AS CONNECTED WITH IT BUT HE DID NOT THE LESS VALUE HIS PRIVILEGES OR THINK THE LESS OF HIS OWN IMPORTANCE
