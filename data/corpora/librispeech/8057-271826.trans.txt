8057-271826-0000 SHE CRIED AND LEAPING OFF THE CAMEL'S BACK SHE SPRANG UPON THE TIGER WHO THEREUPON DRIED HIS TEARS AND SMILED IN A MOST DELIGHTFUL MANNER WE SELDOM HAVE VISITORS IN THIS VALLEY HE SAID
8057-271826-0001 AFTER HE HAD WIPED HIS EYES WITH A HANDKERCHIEF THAT WAS STICKING IN HIS BRIDLE SO MOST OF THE TIME THERE IS NO ONE TO RIDE US I DON'T SEE THE GOOD OF A MERRY GO ROUND IF IT ISN'T USED THE QUEEN NOW NOTICED SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS LOOKING DISCONTENTED
8057-271826-0002 SO SHE AND TOT CHANGED SEATS ALSO AND BY THE TIME MISTER SPLIT CAME TO CALL THEM TO SUPPER THEY HAD RIDDEN ALL THE ANIMALS IN TURN
8057-271826-0003 AND THE KEEPER NOTICED THAT HIS MERRY GO ROUND WAS BATHED IN ONE WHIRLING SMILE OF GLADNESS AND CONTENT IT IS GOOD FOR MY ANIMALS TO HAVE VISITORS HE SAID HAPPILY IT CHEERS THEM UP
8057-271826-0004 MISTER SPLIT HAD SPREAD A WHITE CLOTH UPON THE GRASS CLOSE TO ONE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND DOT AND TOT AND THE QUEEN SAT AROUND THIS AND ATE OF THE DELICIOUS FRUIT THE QUEER MAN HAD GATHERED THERE WERE MELONS GRAPES
8057-271826-0005 BANANAS ORANGES PLUMS STRAWBERRIES AND PEARS AND ALL WERE RIPE AND EXQUISITELY FLAVORED BY THE TIME THEY FINISHED THEIR MEAL IT HAD BECOME TWILIGHT AND THE QUEEN DECLARED IT WOULD SOON BE DARK
8057-271826-0006 I WONDER WHERE WE CAN SLEEP SAID TOT BUT DOT LOOKED AROUND AND SAW THAT MISTER SPLIT WAS FASTENING THREE BIG HAMMOCKS BETWEEN THE TREES AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
8057-271826-0007 THESE HAMMOCKS WERE LINED WITH SOFT SILKEN CUSHIONS AND LOOKED VERY PLEASANT AND COZY TO THE SLEEPY CHILDREN THE QUEEN AND DOT AND TOT EACH CLIMBED INTO ONE OF THE HAMMOCKS AND WERE COVERED OVER WITH SILK QUILTED COMFORTABLES
8057-271826-0008 AFTER WHICH MISTER SPLIT TURNED A KEY AT THE END OF EACH HAMMOCK AND SET THEM MOVING GENTLY TO AND FRO LIKE THE ROCKING OF A CRADLE BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP DOT LOOKED OVER THE EDGE OF HER HAMMOCK AND SAW
8057-271826-0009 THAT THE MERRY GO ROUND AND THE TIN TRAIN WERE NOW MOTIONLESS WHILE ALL THE ANIMALS SEEMED TO HAVE RUN DOWN AND WERE STANDING QUITE STILL WAITING FOR MORNING WHEN MISTER SPLIT WOULD COME AND WIND THEM UP AGAIN
8057-271826-0010 THE LITTLE GIRL WAS AWAKENED NEXT MORNING BY A SHARP CLICKING SOUND NEAR BY AND OPENING HER EYES SHE SAW A TIN MONKEY RUNNING UP AND DOWN A STRING FASTENED TO A BRANCH OF THE TREE DEAR ME SHE SAID LOOKING AT HIM INTENTLY
8057-271826-0011 MISTER SPLIT WAS HERE SOME TIME AGO I SUPPOSE NEARLY EVERYONE IN THE VALLEY MUST BE GOING BY THIS TIME
8057-271826-0012 THE QUEEN NOW JOINED DOT AND THEY CALLED TOT TO BREAKFAST
8057-271826-0013 HE HAD TO SEPARATE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT USE EACH HAND IN A DIFFERENT PLACE AND SO GET AROUND QUICKER MISTER SPLIT'S NAME SUITS HIM VERY WELL SAID DOT WHO WAS ENJOYING THE FRUIT
8057-271826-0014 YES IT WOULD BE HARD TO CALL HIM ANYTHING ELSE REPLIED THE QUEEN I SUPPOSE YOUR OWN NAME FITS YOU IN THE SAME WAY VENTURED THE GIRL CERTAINLY IT DOES
8057-271826-0015 ANSWERED THE QUEEN DOT'S HEART NOW BEGAN TO BEAT RAPIDLY FOR SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD AT LAST DISCOVER WHAT THE QUEEN'S NAME WAS TOT ALSO LOOKED INTERESTED AND FORGOT HIS SLICE OF MELON AS HE LISTENED
8057-271826-0016 THERE IS NO REASON IN THE WORLD WHY YOU SHOULD NOT KNOW MY NAME THEN SAID TOT SHARPLY
8057-271826-0017 JUST THEN THEY HEARD A GREAT CRASH A WHIRLING OF WHEELS AND THE SCREAM OF A WHISTLE SPRINGING TO THEIR FEET THEY SAW THE TIN TRAIN LYING UPSIDE DOWN NEAR THE TRACK WITH ITS WHEELS WHIRLING AROUND LIKE THE WIND
8057-271826-0018 AND NEAR BY WAS A WOODEN GOAT AND CART COMPLETELY WRECKED AND SPLINTERED INTO MANY PIECES THEY ALL RAN DOWN TO THE PLACE AND THE BRAVE LITTLE QUEEN PICKED UP THE TIN TRAIN AND SET IT UPON ITS TRACK
8057-271826-0019 IT STARTED TO RUN AGAIN IN ITS USUAL RUSHING WAY
8057-271826-0020 BUT IT IS WRECKED NOW BEYOND REPAIR SO THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO WORRY ABOUT AS SHE SPOKE THE POLICE PATROL AND THE FIRE ENGINE BOTH DASHED UP TO THE SPOT AND ONE OF THE OFFICERS ASKED
8057-271826-0021 THE TROUBLE IS ALL OVER THEN WE MAY AS WELL GO BACK SAID THE OFFICER GRUMPILY THE TROUBLE USUALLY IS OVER WHEN WE GET ANYWHERE THAT'S WHY WE TAKE OUR TIME ABOUT COMING WELL
8057-271826-0022 THEY LOOKED AROUND FOR MISTER SPLIT BUT NOT SEEING HIM THEY WALKED ACROSS THE OPENING TO THE PATH THAT LED THROUGH THE FOREST TO THE RIVER THEY EACH SQUEAKED THE ALLIGATOR WHEN THEY CAME TO HIM AND LEFT HIM FEELING JOYFUL AND CONTENTED
