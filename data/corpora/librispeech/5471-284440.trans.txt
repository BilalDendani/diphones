5471-284440-0000 TO BE SURE THE MAGIC UMBRELLA WAS NOW IN THE BLUE COUNTRY AND THE FAIRIES THAT DIRECTED ITS FLIGHT MIGHT BE WITH THE UMBRELLA INSTEAD OF WITH THEM YET THE OLD SAILOR HAD ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME STRANGE ADVENTURES IN TROT'S COMPANY
5471-284440-0001 AND KNEW SHE HAD MANAGED TO ESCAPE EVERY DANGER THAT HAD THREATENED SO HE DECIDED NOT TO FIGHT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT AND MEEKLY HOBBLED ALONG THE STREET AS HE WAS COMMANDED TO DO TROT WAS ALSO ENCOURAGED BY THE WITCH'S SUGGESTION
5471-284440-0002 FOR SHE BELIEVED IN FAIRIES AND TRUSTED THEM BUT BUTTON BRIGHT COULD FIND NO COMFORT IN THEIR SITUATION AND HIS FACE WAS VERY SAD AS HE MARCHED ALONG BY TROT'S SIDE
5471-284440-0003 IF THEY HAD FOLLOWED THE CORKSCREW WINDINGS OF THE STREET IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LONG JOURNEY TO THE OUTER EDGE OF THE PINK COUNTRY BUT TOURMALINE TOOK A SHORT CUT LEADING THEM THROUGH PRIVATE GARDENS AND EVEN THROUGH HOUSES
5471-284440-0004 SO THAT THEY FOLLOWED ALMOST A BEE LINE TO THEIR DESTINATION IT RAINED ALL THE WAY AND THE WALKING WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE BUT OUR FRIENDS WERE CONFRONTING AN IMPORTANT CRISIS IN THEIR STRANGE ADVENTURES AND WITH POSSIBLE DEATH AT THEIR JOURNEY'S END THEY WERE IN NO HURRY TO ARRIVE THERE
5471-284440-0005 ONCE FREE OF THE CITY THEY TRAVERSED THE OPEN COUNTRY AND HERE THEY OFTEN STEPPED INTO STICKY PINK MUD UP TO THEIR ANKLES CAP'N BILL'S WOODEN LEG WOULD OFTEN GO DOWN DEEP AND STICK FAST IN THIS MUD
5471-284440-0006 AND AT SUCH TIMES HE WOULD BE HELPLESS UNTIL TWO OF THE PINKIES WHO WERE A STRONG PEOPLE PULLED HIM OUT AGAIN THE PARROT WAS GETTING ITS FEATHERS SADLY DRAGGLED IN THE RAIN AND THE POOR BIRD SOON PRESENTED A WET AND WOEBEGONE APPEARANCE
5471-284440-0007 SOAK US AGAIN DROWN US WITH RAIN IT MUTTERED IN A RESIGNED TONE AND THEN IT WOULD TURN TO TROT AND MOAN THE ROSE IS RED THE VIOLET'S BLUE THE PINKIES ARE A BEASTLY CREW THE COUNTRY WAS NOT SO TRIM AND NEATLY KEPT NEAR THE EDGE
5471-284440-0008 THERE WAS A ROW OF THICK BUSHES WHICH CONCEALED THE GULF BELOW AND AS THEY APPROACHED THESE BUSHES THE RAIN ABRUPTLY CEASED AND THE CLOUDS BEGAN TO BREAK AND DRIFT AWAY IN THE SKY
5471-284440-0009 TWO OF YOU SEIZE THE GIRL AND THROW HER OVER SAID TOURMALINE IN A CALM MATTER OF FACT WAY AND TWO OTHERS MUST THROW THE BOY OVER IT MAY TAKE FOUR PERHAPS TO LIFT THE HUGE AND ANCIENT MAN MORE'N THAT SAID CAP'N BILL GRIMLY
5471-284440-0010 I'M PRETTY SURE IT'LL TAKE ALL O YOU YOUNG LADY AN THE CHANCES ARE YOU WON'T DO IT THEN THEY HAD HALTED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE BUSHES AND NOW THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS AN IMMENSE RAINBOW
5471-284440-0011 IT WAS PERFECTLY FORMED AND GLISTENED WITH A DOZEN OR MORE SUPERB TINTINGS THAT WERE SO VIVID AND BRILLIANT AND BLENDED INTO ONE ANOTHER SO EXQUISITELY THAT EVERY ONE PAUSED TO GAZE ENRAPTURED UPON THE SIGHT
5471-284440-0012 STEADILY YET WITH WONDERFUL SWIFTNESS THE END OF THE GREAT BOW DESCENDED UNTIL IT RESTED UPON THE PINK FIELD ALMOST AT THE FEET OF THE LITTLE PARTY OF OBSERVERS THEN THEY SAW DANCING GAILY UPON THE ARCH
5471-284440-0013 A SCORE OF BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS DRESSED IN FLEECY ROBES OF RAINBOW TINTS WHICH FLUTTERED AROUND THEM LIKE CLOUDS THE DAUGHTERS OF THE RAINBOW WHISPERED TOURMALINE IN AN AWED VOICE AND THE WITCH BESIDE HER NODDED AND SAID
5471-284440-0014 FAIRIES OF THE SKY WHAT DID I TELL YOU TOURMALINE JUST THEN ONE OF THE MAIDENS TRIPPED LIGHTLY DOWN THE SPAN OF THE ARCH UNTIL NEAR THE VERY END LEANING OVER TO OBSERVE THE GROUP BELOW
5471-284440-0015 SHE WAS EXQUISITELY FAIR DAINTY AS A LILY AND GRACEFUL AS A BOUGH SWAYING IN THE BREEZE WHY IT'S POLYCHROME EXCLAIMED BUTTON BRIGHT IN A VOICE OF MINGLED WONDER AND DELIGHT HELLO POLLY DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME

5471-284440-0018 THERE IS WORK FOR ME TO DO HERE FOR ONE OF MY OLD FRIENDS IS IN TROUBLE WITH THIS SHE SPRANG LIGHTLY FROM THE RAINBOW AND STOOD BESIDE BUTTON BRIGHT AND TROT AND SCARCELY HAD SHE LEFT THE SPLENDID ARCH WHEN IT LIFTED AND ROSE INTO THE SKY
5471-284440-0019 THE OTHER END HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN THE CLOUDS AND NOW THE RAINBOW BEGAN TO FADE GRADUALLY LIKE MIST AND THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND SHOT ITS CHEERING RAYS OVER THE PINK COUNTRY UNTIL PRESENTLY THE RAINBOW HAD VANISHED ALTOGETHER
5471-284440-0020 AND THE ONLY REMINDER OF IT WAS THE LOVELY POLYCHROME STANDING AMONG THE WONDERING BAND OF PINKIES TELL ME SHE SAID GENTLY TO THE BOY WHY ARE YOU HERE AND WHY DO THESE PEOPLE OF THE SKY WISH TO DESTROY YOU IN A FEW HURRIED WORDS
5471-284440-0021 BUTTON BRIGHT RELATED THEIR ADVENTURE WITH THE MAGIC UMBRELLA AND HOW THE BOOLOOROO HAD STOLEN IT AND THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO ESCAPE INTO THE PINK COUNTRY POLYCHROME LISTENED AND THEN TURNED TO THE QUEEN WHY HAVE YOU DECREED DEATH TO THESE INNOCENT STRANGERS SHE ASKED
