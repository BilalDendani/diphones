5319-64075-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE DOG ON THE TRAP LINE SOME TRAPPERS WILL TAKE ISSUE IN REGARD TO THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE DOG ON THE TRAP LINE THE SUBJECT HOLDS SUFFICIENT INTEREST HOWEVER TO WARRANT A CHAPTER
5319-64075-0001 AND IF SOME LONESOME TRAPPERS BENEFIT THEREBY OUR EFFORT SHALL STAND JUSTIFIED NOW WE WILL SAY FIRST THAT THERE IS AS MUCH OR MORE DIFFERENCE IN THE MAN WHO HANDLES THE DOG AS THERE IS IN THE DIFFERENT BREEDS OF DOGS
5319-64075-0002 WE HAVE HEARD MEN SAY THAT THEY WANTED NO DOG ON THE TRAP LINE WITH THEM AND THAT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE WHO DID WANT A DOG ON THE TRAP LINE KNEW BUT VERY LITTLE ABOUT TRAPPING AT THE BEST NOW THOSE ARE THE VIEWS AND IDEAS OF SOME TRAPPERS
5319-64075-0003 WHILE MY EXPERIENCE HAS LED ME TO SEE IT OTHERWISE ONE WHO IS SO CONSTITUTED THAT THEY MUST GIVE A DOG THE GROWL OR PERHAPS A KICK EVERY TIME THEY COME IN REACH WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FIND A DOG OF BUT LITTLE USE ON THE TRAP LINE
5319-64075-0004 AT THE FIRST SIGHT OR SOUND OF THEIR MASTER THIS MAN'S DOG IS USUALLY MORE ATTACHED TO A STRANGER THAN TO HIS MASTER THE MAN WHO CANNOT TREAT HIS DOG AS A FRIEND AND COMPANION WILL HAVE GOOD CAUSE TO SAY THAT A DOG IS A NUISANCE ON THE TRAP LINE
5319-64075-0005 I HAVE SEEN MEN TRAINING DOGS FOR BIRD HUNTING WHO WOULD TREAT THE DOG MOST CRUELLY AND CLAIM THAT A DOG COULD NOT BE TRAINED TO WORK A BIRD SUCCESSFULLY UNDER ANY OTHER TREATMENT
5319-64075-0006 THOUGH I HAVE SEEN OTHERS TRAIN THE SAME BREED OF DOGS TO WORK A BIRD TO PERFECTION AND THAT THEIR MOST HARSH TREATMENT WOULD BE A TAP OR TWO WITH A LITTLE SWITCH I WILL SAY THAT ONE WHO CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE WAG OF A DOG'S TAIL
5319-64075-0007 THE WISTFUL GAZE OF THE EYE THE QUICK LIFTING OF THE EARS THE CAUTIOUS RAISING OF A FOOT AND ABOVE ALL TREAT HIS DOG AS A FRIEND NEED EXPECT HIS DOG TO BE BUT LITTLE ELSE THAN A NUISANCE ON THE TRAP LINE
5319-64075-0008 SEVERAL YEARS AGO I HAD A PARTNER WHO HAD A DOG PART STAG HOUND AND THE OTHER PART JUST DOG I THINK ONE DAY HE MY PARTNER ASKED IF I WOULD OBJECT TO HIS BRINGING THE DOG TO CAMP
5319-64075-0009 SAYING THAT HIS WIFE WAS GOING ON A VISIT AND HE HAD NO PLACE TO LEAVE THE DOG I TOLD HIM THAT IF HE HAD A GOOD DOG I WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE HIM IN CAMP IN A DAY OR TWO PARD WENT HOME AND BROUGHT IN THE DOG
5319-64075-0010 AND LOOKING AS THOUGH HE NEVER HEARD A KIND WORD IN HIS LIFE I ASKED IF THE ANIMAL WAS ANY GOOD AND HE REPLIED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW GOOD HE WAS I ASKED THE NAME OF THE DOG HE SAID OH I CALL HIM PONT
5319-64075-0011 I SPOKE TO THE DOG CALLING HIM BY NAME HE LOOKED AT ME WISTFULLY WAGGING HIS TAIL THE LOOK THAT DOG GAVE ME SAID TO ME AS PLAINLY AS WORDS THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST KIND WORD HE HAD EVER HEARD
5319-64075-0012 WE WENT INSIDE AND THE DOG STARTED TO FOLLOW WHEN HIS MASTER IN A HARSH VOICE SAID GET OUT OF HERE I SAID WHERE DO YOU EXPECT THE DOG TO GO I THEN TOOK AN OLD COAT THAT WAS IN THE CAMP
5319-64075-0013 PLACED IT IN THE CORNER AND CALLED GENTLY TO PONT PATTED THE COAT AND TOLD HIM TO LAY DOWN ON THE COAT WHICH HE DID I PATTED HIM SAYING THAT IS A GOOD PLACE FOR PONT AND I CAN SEE THAT WISTFUL GAZE THE DOG GAVE ME NOW
5319-64075-0014 AFTER WE HAD OUR SUPPER I ASKED MY PARTNER IF HE WASN'T GOING TO FIX PONT SOME SUPPER
5319-64075-0015 I TOOK A BISCUIT FROM THE TABLE SPREAD SOME BUTTER ON IT CALLED THE DOG TO ME BROKE THE BISCUIT IN PIECES AND GAVE IT TO THE DOG FROM MY HAND THEN I FOUND AN OLD BASIN THAT CHANCED TO BE ABOUT THE CAMP AND FIXED THE DOG A GOOD SUPPER
5319-64075-0016 AFTER THE DOG HAD FINISHED HIS SUPPER I WENT TO THE COAT IN THE CORNER SPOKE GENTLY TO PONT PATTED THE COAT AND TOLD HIM TO LAY DOWN ON THE COAT THAT WAS THE END OF THAT PONT KNEW HIS PLACE AND TOOK IT WITHOUT ANY FURTHER TROUBLE
5319-64075-0017 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN WE WERE ABOUT READY TO START OUT ON THE TRAP LINE I ASKED PARD WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO WITH PONT HE SAID THAT HE WOULD TIE HIM TO A TREE THAT STOOD AGAINST THE SHANTY CLOSE TO THE DOOR WE WERE GOING TO TAKE DIFFERENT LINES OF TRAPS
5319-64075-0018 I SAID NO AM YOU WON'T BREAK POUT'S NECK WHILE I AM AROUND IT WOULD NOT LOOK NICE I STARTED ON MY WAY PONT FOLLOWING AFTER I HAD GONE A LITTLE WAYS I SPOKE TO PONT PATTING HIM ON THE HEAD AND TOLD HIM WHAT A GOOD DOG HE WAS
5319-64075-0019 HE JUMPED ABOUT AND SHOWED MORE WAYS THAN ONE HOW PLEASED HE WAS AND FROM THAT DAY UNTIL WE BROKE CAMP PONT STAYED WITH ME HE SHOWED PLAINLY THE DISGUST HE HAD FOR HIS MASTER
5319-64075-0020 IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE FIRST TRAP I CAME TO WAS A TRAP SET IN A SPRING RUN AND IT HAD A COON IN IT
5319-64075-0021 THAT ALL THAT PONT NEEDED WAS KIND TREATMENT AND PROPER TRAINING TO MAKE A GOOD HELP ON THE TRAP LINE I WAS CAREFUL TO LET HIM KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING WHEN SETTING A TRAP AND WHEN HE WOULD GO TO SMELL AT THE BAIT AFTER A TRAP HAD BEEN SET
5319-64075-0022 I WOULD SPEAK TO HIM IN A FIRM VOICE AND LET HIM KNOW THAT I DID NOT APPROVE OF WHAT HE WAS DOING WHEN MAKING BLIND SETS I TOOK THE SAME PAINS TO SHOW AND GIVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS DOING I WOULD SOMETIMES AFTER GIVING HIM FAIR WARNING
5319-64075-0023 MISTER TRAPPER PLEASE DO NOT PERSUADE YOURSELF TO BELIEVE THAT THE INTELLIGENT DOG CANNOT UNDERSTAND IF YOU GO ABOUT IT RIGHT IN TWO WEEKS PONT HAD ADVANCED SO FAR IN HIS TRAINING THAT I NO LONGER HAD TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THE TRAPS
5319-64075-0024 THE THIRD DAY PONT WAS WITH ME HE FOUND A COON THAT HAD ESCAPED WITH A TRAP NEARLY TWO WEEKS BEFORE MY ROUTE CALLED ME UP A LITTLE DRAW FROM THE MAIN STREAM I HAD NOT GONE FAR UP THIS WHEN PONT TOOK THE TRAIL OF SOME ANIMAL
5319-64075-0025 AND BEGAN WORKING IT UP THE SIDE OF THE HILL I STOOD AND WATCHED HIM UNTIL THE TRAIL TOOK HIM TO AN OLD LOG WHEN PONT BEGAN TO SNIFF AT A HOLE IN THE LOG HE SOON RAISED HIS HEAD AND GAVE A LONG HOWL AS MUCH AS TO SAY
5319-64075-0026 HE IS HERE AND I WANT HELP AFTER RUNNING A STICK IN THE HOLE I SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE LOG WAS HOLLOW
5319-64075-0027 UNTIL I THOUGHT I WAS AT THE RIGHT POINT AND THEN CHOPPED A HOLE IN THE LOG AND AS GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT I MADE THE OPENING RIGHT ON TO THE COON AND ALMOST THE FIRST THING I SAW ON LOOKING INTO THE LOG WAS THE TRAP PONT SOON HAD THE COON OUT
5319-64075-0028 BUT IT WAS NO GO PONT WOULD NOT GO WITH HIM THEN AM PUT A ROPE ON TO HIM AND TRIED TO LEAD HIM BUT PONT WOULD SULK AND WOULD NOT BE LED THEN AM LOST HIS TEMPER AND WANTED TO BREAK PONT'S NECK AGAIN
5319-64075-0029 WHEN WE CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE THE FOX HAD ESCAPED WITH THE TRAP AM AT ONCE BEGAN TO SLAP HIS HANDS AND HISS PONT ON PONT ONLY CROUCHED BEHIND ME FOR PROTECTION I PERSUADED AM TO GO ON DOWN THE RUN
5319-64075-0030 AND LOOK AT THE TRAPS DOWN THAT WAY WHILE I AND PONT WOULD LOOK AFTER THE ESCAPED FOX AS SOON AS AM WAS GONE I BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT WHERE THE FOX HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND SEARCH FOR HIS TRAIL AND SOON PONT BEGAN TO WAG HIS TAIL
5319-64075-0031 A LITTLE WAY UP THIS WE FOUND WHERE THE FOX HAD BEEN FAST IN SOME BUSHES BUT HAD FREED HIMSELF AND LEFT AND GONE UP THE HILLSIDE PONT SOON BEGAN TO GET UNEASY AND WHEN I SAID HUNT HIM OUT PONT
5319-64075-0032 I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN TEACHING PONT TO LET THE PORCUPINES ALONE BUT AFTER A TIME HE LEARNED THAT THEY WERE NOT THE KIND OF GAME THAT HE WANTED AND HE PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO THEM I HAVE HAD MANY DIFFERENT DOGS ON THE TRAP LINE WITH ME
