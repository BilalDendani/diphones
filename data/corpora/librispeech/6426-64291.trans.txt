6426-64291-0000 I MEAN HE MADE FAR GREATER DEMAND FOR JUSTICE UPON OTHER PEOPLE THAN UPON HIMSELF AND WAS MUCH MORE INDIGNANT AT ANY SHORTCOMING OF THEIRS WHICH CROSSED ANY DESIRE OR PURPOSE OF HIS THAN HE WAS ANXIOUS IN HIS OWN PERSON TO FULFILL JUSTICE WHEN THAT FULFILLMENT IN ITS TURN WOULD CROSS ANY WISH HE CHERISHED
6426-64291-0001 BADLY AS HE HAD HIMSELF BEHAVED TO MARY HE WAS NOW FURIOUS WITH HIS WIFE FOR HAVING TREATED HER SO HEARTLESSLY THAT SHE COULD NOT RETURN TO HER SERVICE
6426-64291-0002 FOR HE BEGAN TO THINK SHE MIGHT BE ONE TO DEPEND UPON AND TO DESIRE HER ALLIANCE IN THE MATTER OF OUSTING SEPIA FROM THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS WIFE HOWEVER INDIFFERENT A WOMAN MAY BE TO THE OPINION OF HER HUSBAND HE CAN NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL MANAGE TO MAKE HER UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH IF HE CHOOSES
6426-64291-0003 AND MISTER REDMAIN DID CHOOSE NOW IN THE EVENT OF HER OPPOSITION TO HIS WISHES WHEN HE SET HIMSELF TO DO A THING HE HATED DEFEAT EVEN MORE THAN HE LOVED SUCCESS THE MOMENT MARY WAS OUT OF THE STUDY HE WALKED INTO HIS WIFE'S BOUDOIR AND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
6426-64291-0004 HIS PRESENCE THERE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HER ANGRY BUT SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF IT I UNDERSTAND MISSUS REDMAIN HE BEGAN THAT YOU WISH TO BRING THE FATE OF SODOM UPON THE HOUSE
6426-64291-0005 YOU'LL HEAR WORSE BEFORE LONG IF YOU KEEP ON AT THIS RATE MY LANGUAGE IS NOT SO BAD AS YOUR ACTIONS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT GIRL BACK AND IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME TOO I SHALL KNOW HOW TO MAKE YOU YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME TO BELIEVE YOU CAPABLE OF ANYTHING
6426-64291-0006 THEN I NEED NOT ASK YOU WHETHER I MARRIED YOU TO PLEASE YOU OR TO PLEASE MYSELF YOU NEED NOT YOU CAN BEST ANSWER THAT QUESTION YOURSELF THEN WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
6426-64291-0007 WE DO NOT MISTER REDMAIN AND IF THIS OCCURS AGAIN I SHALL GO TO DURNMELLING SHE SPOKE WITH A VAGUE IDEA THAT HE ALSO STOOD IN SOME AWE OF THE FATHER AND MOTHER WHOSE DREAD HOWEVER WELL SHE HID IT SHE WOULD NEVER WHILE SHE LIVED SUCCEED IN SHAKING OFF
6426-64291-0008 THEY KNOW BETTER WHICH SIDE THEIR BREAD IS BUTTERED HESPER STARTED UP IN A RAGE
6426-64291-0009 OH DON'T HE CRIED IN A TONE OF PRETENDED ALARM HIS PLEASURE WAS GREAT FOR HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN STINGING THE IMPENETRABLE
6426-64291-0010 USING CABS THEN YOU HAD BETTER GET INTO THE HABIT FOR I SWEAR TO YOU MADAM IF YOU DON'T FETCH THAT GIRL HOME WITHIN THE WEEK I WILL NEXT MONDAY DISCHARGE YOUR COACHMAN AND SEND EVERY HORSE IN THE STABLE TO TATTERSALL'S GOOD MORNING
6426-64291-0011 SHE HAD NO DOUBT HE WOULD DO AS HE SAID
6426-64291-0012 JUST ENJOY SELLING HER HORSES BUT SHE COULD NOT AT ONCE GIVE IN I SAY COULD NOT BECAUSE HERS WAS THE WEAK WILL THAT CAN HARDLY BRING ITSELF TO DO WHAT IT KNOWS IT MUST AND IS CONTINUALLY MISTAKEN FOR THE STRONG WILL
6426-64291-0013 THAT DEFIES AND ENDURES SHE HAD A WEEK TO THINK ABOUT IT AND SHE WOULD SEE DURING THE INTERVAL HE TOOK CARE NOT ONCE TO REFER TO HIS THREAT FOR THAT WOULD BUT WEAKEN THE IMPRESSION OF IT HE KNEW
6426-64291-0014 SHE KNOCKED AT HIS DOOR AND BEING ADMITTED BADE HIM GOOD MORNING BUT WITH NO VERY GRACIOUS AIR AS INDEED HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST TO EXPECT WE HAVE HAD A SERMON ON THE FORGIVENESS OF INJURIES MISTER REDMAIN SHE SAID
6426-64291-0015 BY JOVE INTERRUPTED HER HUSBAND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THE PURPOSE IF I OR POOR MARY MARSTON HAD HAD IT FOR I SWEAR YOU PUT OUR SOULS IN PERIL
6426-64291-0016 BESIDES SHE LOST HER TEMPER AND TALKED ABOUT FORGIVING ME WHEN I WAS IN DESPAIR ABOUT MY RING AND WHAT PRAY WAS YOUR FOOLISH RING COMPARED TO THE GIRL'S CHARACTER A FOOLISH RING INDEED YES
6426-64291-0017 NOT WHERE THERE IS NO HEART IN THE READER HESPER'S FACE FLUSHED BUT SHE DID HER BEST NOT TO LOSE HER TEMPER NOT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANY GREAT LOSS IF SHE HAD FOR THERE IS AS MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE VALUES OF TEMPERS AS IN THOSE WHO LOSE THEM
6426-64291-0018 SHE SAID NOTHING AND HER HUSBAND RESUMED SO YOU CAME TO FORGIVE ME HE SAID AND MARSTON SHE ANSWERED
6426-64291-0019 THAT IS IF THE TERMS OF IT ARE TO MY MIND I WILL MAKE NO TERMS MARSTON MAY RETURN WHEN SHE PLEASES YOU MUST WRITE AND ASK HER
6426-64291-0020 OF COURSE MISTER REDMAIN IT WOULD HARDLY BE SUITABLE THAT YOU SHOULD ASK HER YOU MUST WRITE SO AS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER
6426-64291-0021 YOU ARE NOT A MAN MUST BE FAIR EVEN TO HIS WIFE I WILL SHOW YOU THE LETTER I WRITE IF YOU PLEASE SHE HAD TO SHOW HIM HALF A SCORE ERE HE WAS SATISFIED
6426-64291-0022 AT LENGTH ONE WAS DISPATCHED RECEIVED AND ANSWERED MARY WOULD NOT RETURN SHE HAD LOST ALL HOPE OF BEING OF ANY TRUE SERVICE TO MISSUS REDMAIN AND SHE KNEW THAT WITH TOM AND LETTY
6426-64291-0023 MISSUS REDMAIN CARRIED THE LETTER WITH ILL CONCEALED TRIUMPH TO HER HUSBAND NOR DID HE CONCEAL HIS ANNOYANCE YOU MUST HAVE BEHAVED TO HER VERY CRUELLY HE SAID
6426-64291-0024 AND THERE WAS I HE SAID TO HIMSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE ACTUALLY BEGINNING TO FANCY I HAD PERHAPS THROWN SALT UPON THE TAIL OF THAT RARE BIRD AN HONEST WOMAN
6426-64291-0025 PERHAPS THAT WILL BE TAKEN INTO THE ACCOUNT ONE DAY
6426-64291-0026 BUT MARY LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT AND THOUGHT OF MANY THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE SAID AND DONE BETTER WHEN SHE WAS WITH HESPER AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE GIVEN HERSELF ANOTHER CHANCE BUT SHE COULD NO LONGER FLATTER HERSELF SHE WOULD EVER BE OF ANY REAL GOOD TO HER
6426-64291-0027 EQUAL TO HER OWN DEMANDS UPON HERSELF
