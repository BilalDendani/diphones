1323-138548-0000 LEFT SCANT LEISURE FOR THE CULTIVATION OF THE ARTS AND SCIENCES THERE WAS LITTLE MONEY IN PRIVATE PURSES OR PUBLIC TREASURIES TO BE DEDICATED TO SCHOOLS LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS FEW THERE WERE WITH TIME TO READ LONG AND WIDELY
1323-138548-0001 AND FEWER STILL WHO COULD DEVOTE THEIR LIVES TO THINGS THAT DELIGHT THE EYE AND THE MIND AND YET POOR AND MEAGER AS THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE COLONISTS MAY SEEM BY WAY OF COMPARISON HEROIC EFFORTS WERE MADE IN EVERY COMMUNITY TO LIFT THE PEOPLE ABOVE THE PLANE
1323-138548-0002 OF MERE EXISTENCE AFTER THE FIRST CLEARINGS WERE OPENED IN THE FORESTS THOSE EFFORTS WERE REDOUBLED AND WITH LENGTHENING YEARS TOLD UPON THE THOUGHT AND SPIRIT OF THE LAND THE APPEARANCE DURING THE STRUGGLE WITH ENGLAND
1323-138548-0003 OF AN EXTRAORDINARY GROUP OF LEADERS FAMILIAR WITH HISTORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE ARTS OF WAR GOVERNMENT AND DIPLOMACY ITSELF BORE ELOQUENT TESTIMONY TO THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE AMERICAN INTELLECT NO ONE NOT EVEN THE MOST CRITICAL
1323-138548-0004 SCATTERED FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO GEORGIA THE ADAMSES ELLSWORTH THE MORRISES THE LIVINGSTONS HAMILTON FRANKLIN WASHINGTON MADISON MARSHALL HENRY THE RANDOLPHS AND THE PINCKNEYS
1323-138548-0005 WITHOUT COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN AMERICAN COLONIAL LIFE WHICH FOSTERED MINDS OF DEPTH AND POWER WOMEN SURMOUNTED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES THAN THE MEN IN THE PROCESS OF SELF EDUCATION
1323-138548-0006 AND THEIR KEEN INTEREST IN PUBLIC ISSUES IS EVIDENT IN MANY A RECORD LIKE THE LETTERS OF MISSUS JOHN ADAMS TO HER HUSBAND DURING THE REVOLUTION THE WRITINGS OF MISSUS MERCY OTIS WARREN THE SISTER OF JAMES OTIS WHO MEASURED HER PEN WITH THE BRITISH PROPAGANDISTS
1323-138548-0007 AND THE PATRIOT NEWSPAPERS FOUNDED AND MANAGED BY WOMEN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES IN THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF AMERICA THE CHURCHES ASSUMED A ROLE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
1323-138548-0008 THERE WERE ABUNDANT REASONS FOR THIS IN MANY OF THE COLONIES MARYLAND PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW ENGLAND THE RELIGIOUS IMPULSE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE IMPELLING MOTIVES IN STIMULATING IMMIGRATION IN ALL THE COLONIES
1323-138548-0009 THE CLERGY AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING FORMED THE ONLY CLASS WITH ANY LEISURE TO DEVOTE TO MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT THEY PREACHED ON SUNDAYS AND TAUGHT SCHOOL ON WEEK DAYS THEY LED IN THE DISCUSSION OF LOCAL PROBLEMS AND IN THE FORMATION OF POLITICAL OPINION
1323-138548-0010 IN NEW ENGLAND THE PURITANS WERE SUPREME NOTWITHSTANDING THE EFFORTS OF THE CROWN TO OVERBEAR THEIR AUTHORITY IN THE MIDDLE COLONIES PARTICULARLY THE MULTIPLICATION OF SECTS MADE THE DOMINANCE OF ANY SINGLE DENOMINATION IMPOSSIBLE
1323-138548-0011 WHICH PROMISED IN TIME A SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE AND FREEDOM OF OPINION THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND VIRGINIA WAS THE STRONGHOLD OF THE ENGLISH SYSTEM OF CHURCH AND STATE
1323-138548-0012 THE ANGLICAN FAITH AND WORSHIP WERE PRESCRIBED BY LAW SUSTAINED BY TAXES IMPOSED ON ALL AND FAVORED BY THE GOVERNOR THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILORS AND THE RICHEST PLANTERS THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH SAYS LODGE WAS ONE OF THE APPENDAGES OF THE VIRGINIA ARISTOCRACY
1323-138548-0013 THE CHURCH WAS ALSO SANCTIONED BY LAW AND SUPPORTED BY TAXES IN THE CAROLINAS AFTER SEVENTEEN O FOUR AND IN GEORGIA AFTER THAT COLONY PASSED DIRECTLY UNDER THE CROWN IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FOUR
1323-138548-0014 AGAINST THE PROTESTS OF THE CATHOLICS IT WAS LIKEWISE ESTABLISHED IN MARYLAND IN NEW YORK TOO NOTWITHSTANDING THE RESISTANCE OF THE DUTCH THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WAS FOSTERED BY THE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS
1323-138548-0015 AND THE ANGLICANS EMBRACING ABOUT ONE FIFTEENTH OF THE POPULATION EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ALL OUT OF PROPORTION TO THEIR NUMBERS MANY FACTORS HELPED TO ENHANCE THE POWER OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH IN THE COLONIES
1323-138548-0016 IT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND THE OFFICIAL CLASS SENT OUT TO THE PROVINCES ITS BISHOPS AND ARCHBISHOPS IN ENGLAND WERE APPOINTED BY THE KING AND ITS FAITH AND SERVICE WERE SET FORTH BY ACTS OF PARLIAMENT
1323-138548-0017 HAVING ITS SEAT OF POWER IN THE ENGLISH MONARCHY IT COULD HOLD ITS CLERGY AND MISSIONARIES LOYAL TO THE CROWN AND SO COUNTERACT TO SOME EXTENT THE INDEPENDENT SPIRIT THAT WAS GROWING UP IN AMERICA THE CHURCH ALWAYS A STRONG BULWARK OF THE STATE
1323-138548-0018 THEREFORE HAD A POLITICAL ROLE TO PLAY HERE AS IN ENGLAND ABLE BISHOPS AND FAR SEEING LEADERS FIRMLY GRASPED THIS FACT ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS TO AUGMENT THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCH IN PROVINCIAL AFFAIRS
1323-138548-0019 WHO STILL CHERISHED MEMORIES OF BITTER RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS IN THE MOTHER COUNTRY PURITANISM IN NEW ENGLAND IF THE ESTABLISHED FAITH MADE FOR IMPERIAL UNITY THE SAME COULD NOT BE SAID OF PURITANISM
1323-138548-0020 THE PLYMOUTH PILGRIMS HAD CAST OFF ALL ALLEGIANCE TO THE ANGLICAN CHURCH AND ESTABLISHED A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT CONGREGATION BEFORE THEY CAME TO AMERICA
1323-138548-0021 WITHIN THE CHURCH SOON AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL IN MASSACHUSETTS LIKEWISE FLUNG OFF THEIR YOKE OF UNION WITH THE ANGLICANS IN EACH TOWN A SEPARATE CONGREGATION WAS ORGANIZED THE MALE MEMBERS CHOOSING THE PASTOR THE TEACHERS AND THE OTHER OFFICERS
1323-138548-0022 THEY ALSO COMPOSED THE VOTERS IN THE TOWN MEETING WHERE SECULAR MATTERS WERE DETERMINED THE UNION OF CHURCH AND GOVERNMENT WAS THUS COMPLETE AND UNIFORMITY OF FAITH AND LIFE PRESCRIBED BY LAW AND ENFORCED BY CIVIL AUTHORITIES
1323-138548-0023 BUT THIS WORKED FOR LOCAL AUTONOMY INSTEAD OF IMPERIAL UNITY THE CLERGY BECAME A POWERFUL CLASS DOMINANT THROUGH THEIR LEARNING AND THEIR FEARFUL DENUNCIATIONS OF THE FAITHLESS THEY WROTE THE BOOKS FOR THE PEOPLE TO READ
1323-138548-0024 A DAY OF REST THAT BEGAN AT SIX O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY EVENING AND LASTED UNTIL SUNSET ON SUNDAY ALL WORK ALL TRADING ALL AMUSEMENT AND ALL WORLDLY CONVERSATION WERE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED DURING THOSE HOURS
1323-138548-0025 A THOUGHTLESS MAID SERVANT WHO FOR SOME EARTHLY REASON SMILED IN CHURCH WAS IN DANGER OF BEING BANISHED AS A VAGABOND ROBERT PIKE A DEVOUT PURITAN THINKING THE SUN HAD GONE TO REST VENTURED FORTH ON HORSEBACK ONE SUNDAY EVENING
1323-138548-0026 AND WAS LUCKLESS ENOUGH TO HAVE A RAY OF LIGHT STRIKE HIM THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS
1323-138548-0027 WITH PERSONS ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT THE PURITANS WERE STILL MORE RUTHLESS
1323-138548-0028 EIGHTEEN PEOPLE WERE HANGED ONE WAS PRESSED TO DEATH MANY SUFFERED IMPRISONMENT AND TWO DIED IN JAIL JUST ABOUT THIS TIME HOWEVER THERE CAME A BREAK IN THE UNIFORMITY OF PURITAN RULE
1323-138548-0029 THE CROWN AND CHURCH IN ENGLAND HAD LONG LOOKED UPON IT WITH DISFAVOR
1323-138548-0030 A NEW DOCUMENT ISSUED SEVEN YEARS LATER WRESTED FROM THE PURITANS OF THE COLONY THE RIGHT TO ELECT THEIR OWN GOVERNOR AND RESERVED THE POWER OF APPOINTMENT TO THE KING IT ALSO ABOLISHED THE RULE LIMITING THE SUFFRAGE TO CHURCH MEMBERS
1323-138548-0031 SUBSTITUTING FOR IT A SIMPLE PROPERTY QUALIFICATION THUS A ROYAL GOVERNOR AND AN OFFICIAL FAMILY CERTAIN TO BE EPISCOPALIAN IN FAITH AND MONARCHIST IN SYMPATHIES WERE FORCED UPON MASSACHUSETTS
1323-138548-0032 AND MEMBERS OF ALL RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS IF THEY HAD THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF PROPERTY WERE PERMITTED TO TAKE PART IN ELECTIONS BY THIS ACT IN THE NAME OF THE CROWN THE PURITAN MONOPOLY WAS BROKEN DOWN IN MASSACHUSETTS
1323-138548-0033 AND THAT PROVINCE WAS BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH CONNECTICUT RHODE ISLAND AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE PROPERTY NOT RELIGIOUS FAITH WAS THE TEST FOR THE SUFFRAGE GROWTH OF RELIGIOUS TOLERATION
1323-138548-0034 THOUGH NEITHER THE ANGLICANS OF VIRGINIA NOR THE PURITANS OF MASSACHUSETTS BELIEVED IN TOLERATION FOR OTHER DENOMINATIONS THAT PRINCIPLE WAS STRICTLY APPLIED IN RHODE ISLAND THERE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ROGER WILLIAMS
1323-138548-0035 LIBERTY IN MATTERS OF CONSCIENCE WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE BEGINNING MARYLAND BY GRANTING IN SIXTEEN FORTY NINE FREEDOM TO THOSE WHO PROFESSED TO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST OPENED ITS GATES TO ALL CHRISTIANS AND PENNSYLVANIA TRUE TO THE TENETS OF THE FRIENDS
1323-138548-0036 GAVE FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE TO THOSE
1323-138548-0037 TO BE THE CREATOR UPHOLDER AND RULER OF THE WORLD
1323-138548-0038 BY ONE CIRCUMSTANCE OR ANOTHER THE MIDDLE COLONIES WERE THUS EARLY CHARACTERIZED BY DIVERSITY RATHER THAN UNIFORMITY OF OPINION DUTCH PROTESTANTS HUGUENOTS QUAKERS BAPTISTS PRESBYTERIANS NEW LIGHTS MORAVIANS LUTHERANS
1323-138548-0039 CATHOLICS AND OTHER DENOMINATIONS BECAME TOO STRONGLY INTRENCHED AND TOO WIDELY SCATTERED TO PERMIT ANY ONE OF THEM TO RULE IF IT HAD DESIRED TO DO SO THERE WERE COMMUNITIES AND INDEED WHOLE SECTIONS WHERE ONE OR ANOTHER CHURCH PREVAILED
1323-138548-0040 TOLERATION ENCOURAGED DIVERSITY AND DIVERSITY IN TURN WORKED FOR GREATER TOLERATION THE GOVERNMENT AND FAITH OF THE DISSENTING DENOMINATIONS CONSPIRED WITH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TENDENCIES TO DRAW AMERICA AWAY FROM THE ENGLISH STATE
1323-138548-0041 PRESBYTERIANS QUAKERS BAPTISTS AND PURITANS HAD NO HIERARCHY OF BISHOPS AND ARCHBISHOPS TO BIND THEM TO THE SEAT OF POWER IN LONDON NEITHER DID THEY LOOK TO THAT METROPOLIS FOR GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING ARTICLES OF FAITH
1323-138548-0042 LOCAL SELF GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS ECCLESIASTICAL HELPED TO TRAIN THEM FOR LOCAL SELF GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS POLITICAL THE SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH LED DISSENTERS TO REVOLT IN THE OLD WORLD
