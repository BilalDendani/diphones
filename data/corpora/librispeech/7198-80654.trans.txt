7198-80654-0017 IT SEEMED TO THE GENTLY NURTURED GIRL FROM TILLBURY AS THOUGH SHE HAD FALLEN IN WITH PEOPLE FROM ANOTHER GLOBE EVEN THE MILL HANDS WHOM BESS HARLEY SO SCORNED WERE NOT LIKE THESE GREAT ROUGH FELLOWS WHOSE MINDS SEEMED CONTINUALLY TO BE FIXED UPON BATTLE
7198-80654-0018 THE MEN BEGAN ONE BY ONE TO PUSH BACK THE BENCHES AND GO OUT THERE WAS A GREAT BUSTLE OF GETTING UNDER WAY AS THE TEAMS STARTED FOR THE WOODS AND THE CHOPPERS TOO WENT AWAY TOM HURRIED TO START HIS BIG PAIR OF DAPPLE GRAYS
7198-80654-0019 AND NAN WAS GLAD TO BUNDLE UP AGAIN AND RUN OUT TO WATCH THE EXODUS THEY WERE A MIGHTY CREW AS UNCLE HENRY HAD SAID THE BIG WOODS DID NOT BREED RUNTS
7198-80654-0020 REMEMBERING THE STUNTED QUICK MOVING CHATTERING FRENCH CANADIANS AND THE SCATTERING OF AMERICAN BORN EMPLOYEES AMONG THEM WHO WORKED IN THE TILLBURY MILLS NAN WAS THE MORE AMAZED BY THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THESE WORKMEN
7198-80654-0021 THE WOODSMEN WERE A RACE OF GIANTS BESIDE THE NARROW SHOULDERED FLAT CHESTED PYGMIES WHO TOILED IN THE MILLS TOM STRODE BY WITH HIS TIMBER SLED RAFE LEAPED ON TO RIDE AND TOM PLAYFULLY SNAPPED HIS WHIPLASH AT HIM
7198-80654-0022 NAN WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT THE TWO BROTHERS SMILED AGAIN AT EACH OTHER THEIR RECENT TIFF SEEMED TO BE FORGOTTEN SOME OF THE CHOPPERS HAD ALREADY GONE ON AHEAD TO THE PART OF THE TRACT WHERE THE MARKED TREES WERE BEING FELLED
7198-80654-0023 NOW THE PLUCK PLUCK PLUCK OF THE AXE BLOWS LAID AGAINST THE FOREST MONARCHS REACHED THE GIRL'S EARS SHE THOUGHT THE FLAT STUTTERING SOUND OF THE AXES SAID PLUCK VERY PLAINLY AND THAT THAT WAS JUST THE WORD THEY SHOULD SAY
7198-80654-0024 FOR IT DOES TAKE LOTS OF PLUCK TO DO WORK OF THIS KIND NAN CONFIDED TO HER UNCLE WHO WALKED UP AND DOWN ON THE PORCH SMOKING AN AFTER BREAKFAST PIPE YES NO SOFTIES ALLOWED ON THE JOB SAID HE CHEERFULLY SOME OF THE BOYS MAY BE ROUGH AND HARD NUTS TO CRACK
7198-80654-0025 BUT THEY WANT TO FIGHT SO MUCH GASPED NAN SHO SAID HER UNCLE SLOWLY IT'S MOSTLY TALK THEY FEEL THE ITCH FOR HARD WORK AND HARD PLAY THAT'S ALL
7198-80654-0026 YOU TAKE LIVELY FULL MUSCLED ANIMALS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS BUCKING AND QUARRELING TRYING TO SEE WHICH ONE IS THE BEST TAKE TWO YOUNG FAT STEERS THEY'LL LOCK HORNS AT THE DROP OF A HAT IT'S ANIMAL SPIRITS NAN
7198-80654-0027 THEY FEEL THAT THEY'VE GOT TO LET OFF STEAM WHERE MUSCLE AND PLUCK COUNT FOR WHAT THEY DO IN THE LUMBER CAMPS THERE'S BOUND TO BE MORE OR LESS RUCTIONS PERHAPS THIS MIGHT BE BUT NAN WAS DREADFULLY SORRY NEVERTHELESS THAT UNCLE HENRY HAD THIS TROUBLE WITH MISTER GEDNEY RAFFER
7198-80654-0028 THE GIRL FEARED THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING BESIDES LETTING OFF STEAM IN THE CHALLENGE HER UNCLE HAD THROWN DOWN TO HIS ENEMY OR TO THE MEN THAT ENEMY COULD HIRE TO ATTACK HIM THE TIMBER SLEDGES SOON BEGAN TO DRIFT BACK
7198-80654-0029 FOR SOME OF THE LOGS HAD BEEN CUT BEFORE THE BIG STORM AND HAD ONLY TO BE BROKEN OUT OF THE DRIFTS AND ROLLED UPON THE SLEDS WITH THE AID OF THE MEN'S CANTHOOKS IT WAS A MYSTERY AT FIRST TO NAN HOW THEY COULD GET THREE HUGE LOGS SOME OF THEM THREE FEET IN DIAMETER AT THE BUTT
7198-80654-0030 ON TO THE SLED TWO AT THE BOTTOM AND ONE ROLLED UPON THEM ALL BEING FASTENED SECURELY WITH THE TIMBER CHAIN AND HOOK HOW THE HORSES STRAINED IN THEIR COLLARS TO START THE MIGHTY LOAD
7198-80654-0031 BUT ONCE STARTED THE RUNNERS SLIPPED ALONG EASILY ENOUGH EVEN THROUGH THE DEEP SNOW PACKING THE COMPRESSIBLE STUFF IN ONE PASSAGE AS HARD AS ICE NAN FOLLOWED IN THIS NARROW TRACK TO THE VERY BANK OF THE RIVER WHERE THE LOGS WERE HEAPED IN LONG WINDROWS
7198-80654-0032 READY TO BE LAUNCHED INTO THE STREAM WHEN THE WATERS SHOULD RISE AT THE TIME OF THE SPRING FRESHET TOM MANAGED HIS TEAM ALONE AND UNLOADED ALONE TOO IT WAS MARVELOUS SO NAN THOUGHT THAT HER COUSIN COULD START THE TOP LOG WITH THE GREAT CANTHOOK
7198-80654-0033 AND GUIDE IT AS IT ROLLED OFF THE SLED SO THAT IT SHOULD LIE TRUE WITH TIMBERS THAT HAD BEEN PILED BEFORE THE STRAIN OF HIS WORK MADE HIM PERSPIRE AS THOUGH IT WERE MIDSUMMER HE THRUST THE CALKS ON HIS BOOTSOLES INTO THE LOG
7198-80654-0034 AND THE SHREDS OF BARK AND SMALL CHIPS FLEW AS HE STAMPED TO GET A SECURE FOOTING FOR HIS WORK THEN HE HEAVED LIKE A GIANT HIS SHOULDERS HUMPING UNDER THE BLUE JERSEY HE WORE
7198-80654-0035 AND FINALLY THE LOG TURNED ONCE STARTED IT WAS SOON ROLLED INTO PLACE NAN RAN INTO THE COOK SHED OFTEN TO GET WARM HER UNCLE WAS BUSY WITH THE BOSS OF THE CAMP
7198-80654-0036 SO SHE HAD NOBODY BUT THE COOK AND HIS HELPER TO SPEAK TO FOR A TIME THEREFORE IT WAS LONELINESS THAT MADE HER START OVER THE HALF BEATEN TRAIL FOR THE SPOT WHERE THE MEN WERE AT WORK WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANYBODY
7198-80654-0037 NONE OF THE TEAMS HAD COME BY FOR SOME TIME BUT SHE COULD HEAR FAINTLY THE SOUND OF THE AXES AND THE CALLING OF THE WORKMEN TO EACH OTHER AND THEIR SHARP COMMANDS TO THE HORSES SHE WENT AWAY FROM THE CAMP A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AND THEN FOUND THAT THE TRAIL FORKED
7198-80654-0038 ONE PATH WENT DOWN A LITTLE HILL AND AS THAT SEEMED EASY TO DESCEND NAN FOLLOWED IT INTO A LITTLE HOLLOW IT SEEMED ONLY ONE SLED HAD COME THIS WAY AND NONE OF THE MEN WERE HERE THE VOICES AND AXES SOUNDED FROM HIGHER UP THE RIDGE
7198-80654-0039 SUDDENLY SHE HEARD SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THE NOISE OF THE WOODSMEN IT WAS THE SNARLING VOICE OF A HUGE CAT AND ALMOST INSTANTLY NAN SIGHTED THE CREATURE WHICH STOOD UPON A SNOW COVERED ROCK BESIDE THE PATH
7198-80654-0040 IT HAD TASSELED EARS A WIDE WICKED SMILE BRISTLING WHISKERS AND FANGS THAT REALLY MADE NAN TREMBLE ALTHOUGH SHE WAS SOME YARDS FROM THE BOBCAT AS SHE BELIEVED FROM WHAT HER COUSINS HAD TOLD HER BOBCATS ARE NOT USUALLY DANGEROUS
7198-80654-0041 THEY NEVER SEEK TROUBLE WITH MAN SAVE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND THAT IS WHEN A MOTHER CAT HAS KITTENS TO DEFEND THIS WAS A BIG FEMALE CAT AND ALTHOUGH THE SEASON WAS EARLY SHE HAD LITTERED AND HER KITTENS THREE OF THEM
7198-80654-0042 WERE BEDDED IN A HEAP OF LEAVES BLOWN BY THE WIND INTO A HOLLOW TREE TRUNK THE TIMBERMAN DRIVING THROUGH THE HOLLOW HAD NOT SEEN THE BOBCAT AND HER THREE BLIND BABIES BUT HE HAD ROUSED THE MOTHER CAT AND SHE WAS NOW ALL READY TO SPRING AT INTRUDERS
