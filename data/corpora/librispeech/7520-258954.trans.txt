7520-258954-0000 ONE A LOGICAL EXPLANATION OF INDUSTRY MUST BEGIN WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE NATURE OF WANTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF INDUSTRY IS TO GRATIFY WANTS AN ECONOMIC WANT MAY BE DEFINED AS A FEELING OF INCOMPLETENESS
7520-258954-0001 BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF A PART OF THE OUTER WORLD OR OF SOME CHANGE IN IT OFTEN THE QUESTION ASKED WHEN ONE FIRST SEES A MOVING TROLLEY CAR OR AUTOMOBILE OR BICYCLE IS WHAT MAKES IT GO
7520-258954-0002 THE FIRST QUESTION TO ASK IN THE PART OF THE STUDY OF ECONOMIC SOCIETY HERE UNDERTAKEN IS WHAT IS ITS MOTIVE FORCE
7520-258954-0003 WITHOUT AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION ONE CANNOT HOPE TO UNDERSTAND THE CEASELESS AND VARIED ACTIVITIES OF MEN OCCUPIED IN THE MAKING OF A LIVING THE QUESTION MERITS LONG AND CAREFUL STUDY BUT THE GENERAL ANSWER IS SO SIMPLE
7520-258954-0004 THAT IT SEEMS ALMOST SELF EVIDENT THE MOTIVE FORCE IN ECONOMICS IS FOUND IN THE FEELINGS OF MEN
7520-258954-0005 TWO WANTS AMONG ANIMALS DEPEND ON THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS TO SAY THE UTMOST THAT CREATURES OF A LOWER ORDER THAN MAN CAN DO IS TO TAKE THINGS AS THEY FIND THEM THE IMAGINATION AND INTELLIGENCE OF ANIMALS ARE NOT DEVELOPED ENOUGH
7520-258954-0006 TO LEAD THEM TO DESIRE MUCH BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ORDINARILY TO BE OBTAINED AND SO THE ENVIRONMENT SHAPES AND AFFECTS THE ANIMAL THE FISH IS FITTED TO LIVE IN THE WATER AND THRIVES THERE AND WE MUST BELIEVE ENJOYS LIVING THERE
7520-258954-0007 THE HORSE AND THE COW LIKE BEST THE FOOD OF THE FIELDS AND SO EACH SPECIES OF ANIMAL IN ORDER TO SURVIVE IN THE SEVERE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE HAS BEEN FORCED TO FIT ITSELF TO THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH IT LIVES AFTER THE ANIMAL HAS BEEN THUS FITTED
7520-258954-0008 ITS DESIRE IS FOR THOSE THINGS NORMALLY TO BE FOUND IN ITS SURROUNDINGS SO DIFFERENT ANIMALS DESIRE OR WANT DIFFERENT THINGS BUT ALWAYS IT IS THE ENVIRONMENT THAT DETERMINES THE WANT
7520-258954-0009 THREE IN SIMPLER HUMAN SOCIETIES WANTS ARE MOSTLY CONFINED TO PHYSICAL NECESSITIES THAT IS IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIETY MAN'S WANTS ARE VERY MUCH LIKE THOSE OF THE ANIMALS
7520-258954-0010 MAN BENDS HIS ENERGIES TO SECURING THE THINGS NECESSARY TO SURVIVAL HE FEELS THE PANGS OF HUNGER AND HE STRIVES TO SECURE FOOD HE FEELS THE NEED OF COMPANIONSHIP FOR IT IS ONLY THROUGH ASSOCIATION AND MUTUAL HELP THAT MEN
7520-258954-0011 SO WEAK AS COMPARED WITH MANY KINDS OF ANIMALS ARE ABLE TO RESIST THE ENEMIES WHICH BESET THEM HE NEEDS CLOTHING TO PROTECT HIM AGAINST THE HARSHER CLIMATES OF THE LANDS TO WHICH HE MOVES
7520-258954-0012 HE NEEDS A SHELTER A CAVE A WIGWAM OR A HUT
7520-258954-0013 FOUR IN HUMAN SOCIETY WANTS DEVELOP AND TRANSFORM THE WORLD IN THE RUDEST SOCIETIES OF WHICH THERE IS ANY RECORD SAVAGES ARE FOUND WITH WANTS DEVELOPED IN A GREAT NUMBER OF DIRECTIONS BEYOND THE WANTS OF ANY ANIMALS
7520-258954-0014 MAN IS NOT A PASSIVE VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES HIS WANTS ARE NOT DETERMINED SOLELY BY HIS ENVIRONMENT HIS DESIRES SOAR BEYOND THE THINGS ABOUT HIM AS MEN BECOME MORE THE MASTERS OF CIRCUMSTANCES
7520-258954-0015 THEIR DESIRES ANTICIPATE MERE PHYSICAL WANTS THEY SEEK A MORE VARIED FOOD OF FINER FLAVOR AND MORE DELICATELY PREPARED DRESS IS NOT LIMITED BY PHYSICAL COMFORT FOR ONE OF THE EARLIEST OF THE ESTHETIC WANTS TO DEVELOP IS THE LOVE OF PERSONAL ORNAMENT
7520-258954-0016 THE RUDE HUT OR COMMUNAL LODGE TO PROTECT AGAINST RAIN AND COLD BECOMES A HOME OUT OF THE EARLIER RUDE COMPANIONSHIP DEVELOP THE NOBLEST SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP AND FAMILY LIFE SEEKING TO GRATIFY THE SENSES
7520-258954-0017 AND THE LOVE OF ACTION MEN DEVELOP ESTHETIC TASTES THE LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL IN SOUND IN FORM IN TASTE IN COLOR IN MOTION
7520-258954-0018 THERE GROW UP THE VARIOUS FORMS OF INTELLECTUAL PLEASURES THE LOVE OF READING OF STUDY OF TRAVEL AND OF THOUGHT THE VARIOUS WANTS OF MAN ARE SOMETIMES CLASSIFIED AS NECESSITIES COMFORTS AND LUXURIES
7520-258954-0019 BUT ALL ECONOMISTS TAKE CARE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE TERMS HAVE ONLY RELATIVE MEANINGS WHICH IN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS OF MODERN LIFE ARE CHANGING CONSTANTLY THE COMFORTS OF ONE GENERATION OR OF ONE COUNTRY BECOME THE NECESSITIES IN ANOTHER
7520-258954-0020 AND LUXURIES BECOMING COMFORTS ARE LOOKED UPON FINALLY AS NECESSITIES AND AS THE DESIRES GROW THEY MORE AND MORE ALTER THE WORLD MAN HAS CHANGED THE FACE OF THE EARTH HE HAS AFFECTED ITS CLIMATE
7520-258954-0021 ITS FERTILITY ITS BEAUTY BECAUSE EITHER FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE
7520-258954-0022 FIVE IN HUMAN SOCIETY THE GROWTH OF WANTS IS NECESSARY TO PROGRESS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TEACHERS OF MORALS HAVE ARGUED FOR SIMPLICITY OF LIFE AND AGAINST THE DEVELOPMENT OF REFINEMENTS
7520-258954-0023 WE DO NOT NOW RAISE THE MORAL QUESTION BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE ECONOMIC EFFECT OF DEVELOPING WANTS IS IN THE MAIN TO IMPEL TO GREATER EFFORT THEY ARE THE MAINSPRING OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS
7520-258954-0024 THE TOO GREAT CONTENTEDNESS OF TROPICAL PEOPLES HAS BEEN BROUGHT OUT PROMINENTLY SOME ONE HAS SAID THAT IF A COLONY OF NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL TEACHERS AND PRESBYTERIAN DEACONS
7520-258954-0025 THEIR DESCENDANTS WOULD IN A SINGLE GENERATION BE WEARING BREECH CLOUTS AND GOING TO COCK FIGHTS ON SUNDAY CERTAIN IT IS THAT THE ENERGY AND AMBITION OF THE TEMPERATE ZONE ARE HARD TO MAINTAIN IN WARMER LANDS
7520-258954-0026 THE NEGRO'S CONTENT WITH HARD CONDITIONS SO OFTEN COUNTED AS A VIRTUE IS ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF SOLVING THE RACE PROBLEM IN OUR SOUTH TO DAY BOOKER T WASHINGTON AND OTHERS
7520-258954-0027 WHO ARE LABORING FOR THE ELEVATION OF THE AMERICAN NEGROES WOULD TRY FIRST TO MAKE THEM DISCONTENTED WITH THE ONE ROOM CABINS IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES LIVE IF ONLY THE DESIRE FOR A TWO OR THREE ROOM CABIN CAN BE AROUSED
7520-258954-0028 NOT ONLY IN AMERICA BUT IN MOST CIVILIZED LANDS TO DAY IS SEEN A RAPID GROWTH OF WANTS IN THE WORKING CLASSES THE INCOMES AND THE STANDARD OF LIVING HAVE BECOME INCREASING BUT NOT SO FAST AS HAVE THE DESIRES OF THE WORKING CLASSES
7520-258954-0029 REGRET HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY SOME THAT THE WORKERS OF EUROPE ARE BECOMING DECLASSED INCREASING WAGES IT IS SAID BRING NOT WELFARE BUT UNHAPPINESS TO THE COMPLAINING MASSES
7520-258954-0030 IF DISCONTENT WITH ONE'S LOT GOES BEYOND A MODERATE DEGREE IF IT IS MORE THAN THE DESIRE TO BETTER ONE'S LOT BY PERSONAL EFFORTS IF IT BECOMES AN UNHAPPY LONGING FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE THEN INDEED IT MAY BE A MISFORTUNE
7520-258954-0031 BUT A MODERATE AMBITION TO BETTER ONE'S CONDITION IS THE DIVINE DISCONTENT ABSOLUTELY INDISPENSABLE IF ENERGY AND ENTERPRISE
7520-258954-0032 IT IS A SUGGESTIVE FACT THAT CIVILIZED MAN EQUIPPED WITH ALL OF THE INVENTIONS AND THE ADVANTAGES OF SCIENCE SPENDS MORE HOURS OF EFFORT IN GAINING A LIVELIHOOD THAN DOES THE SAVAGE WITH HIS ALMOST UNAIDED HANDS
7520-258954-0033 ACTIVITY IS DEPENDENT NOT ON BARE PHYSICAL NECESSITY BUT ON DEVELOPED WANTS IN THE ECONOMIC SENSE OF THE TERM SUCH SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS PROPERTY AND INHERITANCE OWE THEIR ORIGIN AND THEIR JUSTIFICATION
7520-258954-0034 TO THEIR AVERAGE EFFECT ON THE MOTIVES TO ACTIVITY IF SOCIETY IS TO DEVELOP IF PROGRESS IS TO CONTINUE HUMAN WANTS NOT OF THE GROSSER SORT BUT EVER MORE REFINED MUST CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND URGE MEN TO ACTION
7520-258954-0035 ONE THE SPIRITUAL NATURE OF MAN MUST NOT BE IGNORED IN ECONOMIC REASONING THERE HAS BEEN MUCH AND JUST CRITICISM OF THE EARLIER WRITERS AND OF THEIR CONCLUSIONS BECAUSE SO LITTLE ACCOUNT WAS TAKEN BY THEM
7520-258954-0036 OF ANY BUT THE MOTIVE OF SELF INTEREST IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS GENERALLY IT WAS ASSUMED THAT MEN KNEW THEIR OWN INTEREST AND SOUGHT IN A VERY UNSYMPATHETIC WAY THOSE THINGS WHICH WOULD GRATIFY THEIR MATERIAL WANTS
7520-258954-0037 THUS MAN IN ECONOMIC REASONING WAS MADE AN ABSTRACTION
7520-258954-0038 MAY BECOME ECONOMIC MOTIVES TWO THE MAIN CLASSES OF NON MATERIAL WANTS THAT ARE SECONDARILY ECONOMIC ARE FEAR OF TEMPORAL PUNISHMENT SENTIMENTS OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS DUTY PRIDE
7520-258954-0039 HONOR AND FEAR OF DISGRACE AND PLEASURE IN WORK FOR ITSELF FOR SOCIAL APPROVAL OR FOR A SOCIAL RESULT THE FIRST IS BEST ILLUSTRATED BY SLAVERY WHERE THE SLAVE IS NOT IMPELLED TO SEEK WEALTH FOR HIS OWN WELFARE
7520-258954-0040 BUT IS DRIVEN BY PUNISHMENT TO PERFORM THE TASK THE OBJECT IS TO CREATE WITHIN THE MIND OF THE SLAVE A MOTIVE THAT WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF THE ORDINARY ECONOMIC MOTIVE THE FEELING OF RELIGIOUS OR MORAL DUTY
7520-258954-0041 LEADS MEN TO ACT OFTEN IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE USUAL ECONOMIC MOTIVE THE TABOO IS FAITHFULLY OBSERVED BY THE MEMBERS OF A SAVAGE TRIBE
7520-258954-0042 A RELIGIOUS INJUNCTION PREVENTS THE USE OF FOOD THAT WOULD SAVE FROM STARVATION PRIDE EITHER OF FAMILY OR OF CALLING THE SOLDIER'S HONOR LEADING HIM TO SACRIFICE NOT ONLY HIS FUTURE BUT HIS LIFE
7520-258954-0043 THE LOVE OF SOCIAL APPROVAL HOLDING MEN TO THE MOST DISAGREEABLE TASKS THESE ILLUSTRATE HOW STRONGLY SOCIAL SENTIMENTS OPPOSE THE NARROWER MOTIVE OF IMMEDIATE SELF INTEREST AS GENERALLY THOUGHT OF PLEASURE IN WORK FOR WORK'S SAKE
7520-258954-0044 AND PRIDE IN THE RESULT MAY ACT AS MOTIVES QUITE AS STRONG IN SOME CASES AS DESIRE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT CAN BE USED AND EVEN WHERE THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE KIND OF WORK DONE
7520-258954-0045 THREE WHATEVER MOTIVE IN MAN'S COMPLEX NATURE MAKES HIM DESIRE THINGS MORE OR LESS BECOMES FOR THE TIME AND IN SO FAR AN ECONOMIC MOTIVE THESE VARIOUS SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL MOTIVES SOMETIMES WORK POSITIVELY
7520-258954-0046 IN THE DIRECTION OF MAGNIFYING MAN'S DESIRE FOR THINGS SOMETIMES NEGATIVELY TO DIMINISH IT IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC ACTION WE MUST TAKE MEN AS THEY ARE A RELIGIOUS MOTIVE THAT LEADS MEN TO REFRAIN FROM THE EATING OF MEAT
7520-258954-0047 OR TO EAT FISH IN PREFERENCE ON CERTAIN DAYS IS A FACT WHICH THE ECONOMIST HAS BUT TO ACCEPT FOR IT IS SURE TO AFFECT THE VALUE OF MEAT AND FISH AT THAT PLACE AND TIME MORAL CONVICTIONS WHATEVER BE THEIR ORIGIN
7520-258954-0048 WHETHER DUE TO THE TEACHING OF PARENTS TO UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCES OR TO NATIVE TEMPERAMENT MAY BE QUITE AS EFFECTIVE AS THE PANGS OF HUNGER IN DETERMINING WHAT MEN DESIRE THEREFORE
