4407-13145-0000 AND LAST OF ALL BECAUSE THE HARDEST OF ALL LET US LEAVE IF POSSIBLE MYSELF BUT TIS IMPOSSIBLE I MUST GO ALONG WITH YOU TO THE END OF THE WORK
4407-13145-0001 WHICH LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S KITCHEN GARDEN AND WHICH WAS THE SCENE OF SO MANY OF HIS DELICIOUS HOURS
4407-13145-0002 BUT IN HIS IMAGINATION FOR I AM SURE I GAVE HIM SO MINUTE A DESCRIPTION I WAS ALMOST ASHAMED OF IT WHEN FATE WAS LOOKING FORWARDS ONE AFTERNOON INTO THE GREAT TRANSACTIONS OF FUTURE TIMES AND RECOLLECTED FOR WHAT PURPOSES THIS LITTLE PLOT
4407-13145-0003 BY A DECREE FAST BOUND DOWN IN IRON HAD BEEN DESTINED SHE GAVE A NOD TO NATURE
4407-13145-0004 NATURE THREW HALF A SPADE FULL OF HER KINDLIEST COMPOST UPON IT WITH JUST SO MUCH CLAY IN IT AS TO RETAIN THE FORMS OF ANGLES AND INDENTINGS AND SO LITTLE OF IT TOO AS NOT TO CLING TO THE SPADE AND RENDER WORKS OF SO MUCH GLORY NASTY IN FOUL WEATHER
4407-13145-0005 MY UNCLE TOBY CAME DOWN AS THE READER HAS BEEN INFORMED WITH PLANS ALONG WITH HIM OF ALMOST EVERY FORTIFIED TOWN IN ITALY AND FLANDERS SO LET THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH OR THE ALLIES HAVE SET DOWN BEFORE WHAT TOWN THEY PLEASED MY UNCLE TOBY WAS PREPARED FOR THEM
4407-13145-0006 HIS WAY WHICH WAS THE SIMPLEST ONE IN THE WORLD WAS THIS AS SOON AS EVER A TOWN WAS INVESTED BUT SOONER WHEN THE DESIGN WAS KNOWN TO TAKE THE PLAN OF IT LET IT BE WHAT TOWN IT WOULD
4407-13145-0007 HE SET THE CORPORAL TO WORK AND SWEETLY WENT IT ON THE NATURE OF THE SOIL THE NATURE OF THE WORK ITSELF AND ABOVE ALL THE GOOD NATURE OF MY UNCLE TOBY SITTING BY FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND CHATTING KINDLY WITH THE CORPORAL UPON PAST DONE DEEDS
4407-13145-0008 LEFT LABOUR LITTLE ELSE BUT THE CEREMONY OF THE NAME WHEN THE PLACE WAS FINISHED IN THIS MANNER AND PUT INTO A PROPER POSTURE OF DEFENCE IT WAS INVESTED AND MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL BEGAN TO RUN THEIR FIRST PARALLEL I BEG I MAY NOT BE INTERRUPTED IN MY STORY BY BEING TOLD
4407-13145-0009 AND THAT I HAVE NOT LEFT A SINGLE INCH FOR IT FOR MY UNCLE TOBY TOOK THE LIBERTY OF INCROACHING UPON HIS KITCHEN GARDEN FOR THE SAKE OF ENLARGING HIS WORKS ON THE BOWLING GREEN AND FOR THAT REASON GENERALLY RAN HIS FIRST AND SECOND PARALLELS BETWIXT TWO ROWS OF HIS CABBAGES AND HIS CAULIFLOWERS
4407-13145-0010 THE CONVENIENCES AND INCONVENIENCES OF WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED AT LARGE IN THE HISTORY OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S AND THE CORPORAL'S CAMPAIGNS OF WHICH THIS I'M NOW WRITING IS BUT A SKETCH AND WILL BE FINISHED IF I CONJECTURE RIGHT IN THREE PAGES BUT THERE IS NO GUESSING
4407-13145-0011 THE CAMPAIGNS THEMSELVES WILL TAKE UP AS MANY BOOKS AND THEREFORE I APPREHEND IT WOULD BE HANGING TOO GREAT A WEIGHT OF ONE KIND OF MATTER IN SO FLIMSY A PERFORMANCE AS THIS TO RHAPSODIZE THEM AS I ONCE INTENDED INTO THE BODY OF THE WORK SURELY THEY HAD BETTER BE PRINTED APART
4407-13145-0012 WE'LL CONSIDER THE AFFAIR SO TAKE THE FOLLOWING SKETCH OF THEM IN THE MEAN TIME
4407-13145-0013 WHEN THE TOWN WITH ITS WORKS WAS FINISHED MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL BEGAN TO RUN THEIR FIRST PARALLEL NOT AT RANDOM OR ANY HOW BUT FROM THE SAME POINTS AND DISTANCES THE ALLIES HAD BEGUN TO RUN THEIRS
4407-13145-0014 AND REGULATING THEIR APPROACHES AND ATTACKS BY THE ACCOUNTS MY UNCLE TOBY RECEIVED FROM THE DAILY PAPERS THEY WENT ON DURING THE WHOLE SIEGE STEP BY STEP WITH THE ALLIES
4407-13145-0015 AND SO ON GAINING GROUND AND MAKING THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE WORKS ONE AFTER ANOTHER TILL THE TOWN FELL INTO THEIR HANDS TO ONE WHO TOOK PLEASURE IN THE HAPPY STATE OF OTHERS THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A GREATER SIGHT IN WORLD THAN ON A POST MORNING
4407-13145-0016 IN WHICH A PRACTICABLE BREACH HAD BEEN MADE BY THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH
4407-13145-0017 AND OBSERVED THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH MY UNCLE TOBY WITH TRIM BEHIND HIM SALLIED FORTH THE ONE WITH THE GAZETTE IN HIS HAND THE OTHER WITH A SPADE ON HIS SHOULDER TO EXECUTE THE CONTENTS WHAT AN HONEST TRIUMPH IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S LOOKS AS HE MARCHED UP TO THE RAMPARTS
4407-13145-0018 WHAT INTENSE PLEASURE SWIMMING IN HIS EYE AS HE STOOD OVER THE CORPORAL READING THE PARAGRAPH TEN TIMES OVER TO HIM AS HE WAS AT WORK LEST PERADVENTURE HE SHOULD MAKE THE BREACH AN INCH TOO WIDE OR LEAVE IT AN INCH TOO NARROW
4407-13145-0019 EARTH SEA BUT WHAT AVAILS APOSTROPHES WITH ALL YOUR ELEMENTS WET OR DRY YE NEVER COMPOUNDED SO INTOXICATING A DRAUGHT IN THIS TRACK OF HAPPINESS FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT ONE INTERRUPTION TO IT
4407-13145-0020 EXCEPT NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND CONTINUED TO BLOW DUE WEST FOR A WEEK OR TEN DAYS TOGETHER WHICH DETAINED THE FLANDERS MAIL AND KEPT THEM SO LONG IN TORTURE BUT STILL TWAS THE TORTURE OF THE HAPPY IN THIS TRACK I SAY
4407-13145-0021 DID MY UNCLE TOBY AND TRIM MOVE FOR MANY YEARS EVERY YEAR OF WHICH AND SOMETIMES EVERY MONTH
4407-13145-0022 ADDING SOME NEW CONCEIT OR QUIRK OF IMPROVEMENT TO THEIR OPERATIONS WHICH ALWAYS OPENED FRESH SPRINGS OF DELIGHT IN CARRYING THEM ON THE FIRST YEAR'S CAMPAIGN WAS CARRIED ON FROM BEGINNING TO END IN THE PLAIN AND SIMPLE METHOD I'VE RELATED
4407-13145-0023 IN THE SECOND YEAR IN WHICH MY UNCLE TOBY TOOK LIEGE AND RUREMOND HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT AFFORD THE EXPENCE OF FOUR HANDSOME DRAW BRIDGES OF TWO OF WHICH I HAVE GIVEN AN EXACT DESCRIPTION IN THE FORMER PART OF MY WORK
4407-13145-0024 AT THE LATTER END OF THE SAME YEAR HE ADDED A COUPLE OF GATES WITH PORT CULLISES THESE LAST WERE CONVERTED AFTERWARDS INTO ORGUES AS THE BETTER THING AND DURING THE WINTER OF THE SAME YEAR MY UNCLE TOBY INSTEAD OF A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES WHICH HE ALWAYS HAD AT CHRISTMAS
4407-13145-0025 TREATED HIMSELF WITH A HANDSOME SENTRY BOX TO STAND AT THE CORNER OF THE BOWLING GREEN BETWIXT WHICH POINT AND THE FOOT OF THE GLACIS THERE WAS LEFT A LITTLE KIND OF AN ESPLANADE FOR HIM AND THE CORPORAL TO CONFER AND HOLD COUNCILS OF WAR UPON THE SENTRY BOX WAS IN CASE OF RAIN
4407-13145-0026 ALL THESE WERE PAINTED WHITE THREE TIMES OVER THE ENSUING SPRING WHICH ENABLED MY UNCLE TOBY TO TAKE THE FIELD WITH GREAT SPLENDOUR MY FATHER WOULD OFTEN SAY TO YORICK THAT IF ANY MORTAL IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE HAD DONE SUCH A THING EXCEPT HIS BROTHER TOBY
4407-13145-0027 THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT PARTICULARLY THAT VERY YEAR HAD TAKEN THE FIELD BUT TIS NOT MY BROTHER TOBY'S NATURE KIND SOUL MY FATHER WOULD ADD TO INSULT ANY ONE BUT LET US GO ON
4407-13145-0028 THAT ALTHOUGH IN THE FIRST YEAR'S CAMPAIGN THE WORD TOWN IS OFTEN MENTIONED YET THERE WAS NO TOWN AT THAT TIME WITHIN THE POLYGON THAT ADDITION WAS NOT MADE TILL THE SUMMER FOLLOWING THE SPRING IN WHICH THE BRIDGES AND SENTRY BOX WERE PAINTED WHICH WAS THE THIRD YEAR OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S CAMPAIGNS
4407-13145-0029 WHEN UPON HIS TAKING AMBERG BONN AND RHINBERG AND HUY AND LIMBOURG ONE AFTER ANOTHER A THOUGHT CAME INTO THE CORPORAL'S HEAD THAT TO TALK OF TAKING SO MANY TOWNS WITHOUT ONE TOWN TO SHEW FOR IT WAS A VERY NONSENSICAL WAY OF GOING TO WORK
4407-13145-0030 THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE MODEL OF A TOWN BUILT FOR THEM TO BE RUN UP TOGETHER OF SLIT DEALS
4407-13145-0031 AND CLAPPED WITHIN THE INTERIOR POLYGON TO SERVE FOR ALL MY UNCLE TOBY FELT THE GOOD OF THE PROJECT INSTANTLY AND INSTANTLY AGREED TO IT BUT WITH THE ADDITION OF TWO SINGULAR IMPROVEMENTS
4407-13145-0032 AND THE REST OF THE TOWNS IN BRABANT AND FLANDERS THE OTHER WAS NOT TO HAVE THE HOUSES RUN UP TOGETHER AS THE CORPORAL PROPOSED BUT TO HAVE EVERY HOUSE INDEPENDENT TO HOOK ON OR OFF SO AS TO FORM INTO THE PLAN OF WHATEVER TOWN THEY PLEASED
4407-13145-0033 THIS WAS PUT DIRECTLY INTO HAND AND MANY AND MANY A LOOK OF MUTUAL CONGRATULATION WAS EXCHANGED BETWEEN MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL AS THE CARPENTER DID THE WORK IT ANSWERED PRODIGIOUSLY THE NEXT SUMMER THE TOWN WAS A PERFECT PROTEUS IT WAS LANDEN AND TREREBACH
4407-13145-0034 AND DRUSEN AND HAGENAU AND THEN IT WAS OSTEND AND MENIN AND AETH AND DENDERMOND SURELY NEVER DID ANY TOWN ACT SO MANY PARTS SINCE SODOM AND GOMORRAH AS MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOWN DID IN THE FOURTH YEAR
4407-13145-0035 MY UNCLE TOBY THINKING A TOWN LOOKED FOOLISHLY WITHOUT A CHURCH ADDED A VERY FINE ONE WITH A STEEPLE TRIM WAS FOR HAVING BELLS IN IT MY UNCLE TOBY SAID THE METAL HAD BETTER BE CAST INTO CANNON THIS
4407-13145-0036 AND IN A SHORT TIME THESE LED THE WAY FOR A TRAIN OF SOMEWHAT LARGER
4407-13145-0037 FROM PIECES OF HALF AN INCH BORE TILL IT CAME AT LAST TO MY FATHER'S JACK BOOTS THE NEXT YEAR WHICH WAS THAT IN WHICH LISLE WAS BESIEGED AND AT THE CLOSE OF WHICH BOTH GHENT AND BRUGES FELL INTO OUR HANDS
4407-13145-0038 MY UNCLE TOBY WAS SADLY PUT TO IT FOR PROPER AMMUNITION I SAY PROPER AMMUNITION BECAUSE HIS GREAT ARTILLERY WOULD NOT BEAR POWDER AND TWAS WELL FOR THE SHANDY FAMILY THEY WOULD NOT FOR SO FULL WERE THE PAPERS
4407-13145-0039 OF THE INCESSANT FIRINGS KEPT UP BY THE BESIEGERS AND SO HEATED WAS MY UNCLE TOBY'S IMAGINATION WITH THE ACCOUNTS OF THEM THAT HE HAD INFALLIBLY SHOT AWAY ALL HIS ESTATE SOMETHING THEREFORE WAS WANTING AS A SUCCEDANEUM
4407-13145-0040 ESPECIALLY IN ONE OR TWO OF THE MORE VIOLENT PAROXYSMS OF THE SIEGE TO KEEP UP SOMETHING LIKE A CONTINUAL FIRING IN THE IMAGINATION AND THIS SOMETHING THE CORPORAL WHOSE PRINCIPAL STRENGTH LAY IN INVENTION SUPPLIED BY AN ENTIRE NEW SYSTEM OF BATTERING OF HIS OWN WITHOUT WHICH
4407-13145-0041 AS ONE OF THE GREAT DESIDERATA OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S APPARATUS
