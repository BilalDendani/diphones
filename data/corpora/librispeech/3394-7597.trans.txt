3394-7597-0000 THE PREMATURE BURIAL THERE ARE CERTAIN THEMES OF WHICH THE INTEREST IS ALL ABSORBING BUT WHICH ARE TOO ENTIRELY HORRIBLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF LEGITIMATE FICTION
3394-7597-0001 IF HE DO NOT WISH TO OFFEND OR TO DISGUST THEY ARE WITH PROPRIETY HANDLED ONLY WHEN THE SEVERITY AND MAJESTY OF TRUTH SANCTIFY AND SUSTAIN THEM WE THRILL FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE MOST INTENSE OF PLEASURABLE PAIN OVER THE ACCOUNTS OF THE PASSAGE OF THE BERESINA
3394-7597-0002 OF THE EARTHQUAKE AT LISBON OF THE PLAGUE AT LONDON OF THE MASSACRE OF SAINT BARTHOLOMEW
3394-7597-0003 AS INVENTIONS WE SHOULD REGARD THEM WITH SIMPLE ABHORRENCE I HAVE MENTIONED
3394-7597-0004 I NEED NOT REMIND THE READER THAT FROM THE LONG AND WEIRD CATALOGUE OF HUMAN MISERIES I MIGHT HAVE SELECTED MANY INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES MORE REPLETE WITH ESSENTIAL SUFFERING THAN ANY OF THESE VAST GENERALITIES OF DISASTER THE TRUE WRETCHEDNESS INDEED THE ULTIMATE WOE
3394-7597-0005 ARE AT BEST SHADOWY AND VAGUE WHO SHALL SAY WHERE THE ONE ENDS AND WHERE THE OTHER BEGINS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE DISEASES IN WHICH OCCUR TOTAL CESSATIONS OF ALL THE APPARENT FUNCTIONS OF VITALITY
3394-7597-0006 AND YET IN WHICH THESE CESSATIONS ARE MERELY SUSPENSIONS PROPERLY SO CALLED THEY ARE ONLY TEMPORARY PAUSES IN THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE MECHANISM A CERTAIN PERIOD ELAPSES
3394-7597-0007 HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE I MIGHT REFER AT ONCE IF NECESSARY TO A HUNDRED WELL AUTHENTICATED INSTANCES ONE OF VERY REMARKABLE CHARACTER
3394-7597-0008 OCCURRED NOT VERY LONG AGO IN THE NEIGHBORING CITY OF BALTIMORE WHERE IT OCCASIONED A PAINFUL INTENSE AND WIDELY EXTENDED EXCITEMENT THE WIFE OF
3394-7597-0009 WHICH COMPLETELY BAFFLED THE SKILL OF HER PHYSICIANS AFTER MUCH SUFFERING SHE DIED
3394-7597-0010 NO ONE SUSPECTED INDEED OR HAD REASON TO SUSPECT THAT SHE WAS NOT ACTUALLY DEAD
3394-7597-0011 PULSATION HAD CEASED FOR THREE DAYS THE BODY WAS PRESERVED UNBURIED DURING WHICH IT HAD ACQUIRED A STONY RIGIDITY THE FUNERAL IN SHORT WAS HASTENED ON ACCOUNT OF THE RAPID ADVANCE OF WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DECOMPOSITION THE LADY WAS DEPOSITED IN HER FAMILY VAULT
3394-7597-0012 FROM THE LETHARGY WHICH HAD BEEN MISTAKEN FOR DEATH HE BORE HER FRANTICALLY TO HIS LODGINGS IN THE VILLAGE HE EMPLOYED CERTAIN POWERFUL RESTORATIVES SUGGESTED BY NO LITTLE MEDICAL LEARNING
3394-7597-0013 SHE REMAINED WITH HIM UNTIL BY SLOW DEGREES SHE FULLY RECOVERED HER ORIGINAL HEALTH HER WOMAN'S HEART WAS NOT ADAMANT AND THIS LAST LESSON OF LOVE SUFFICED TO SOFTEN IT
3394-7597-0014 SHE RETURNED NO MORE TO HER HUSBAND BUT CONCEALING FROM HIM HER RESURRECTION
3394-7597-0015 A VERY DISTRESSING EVENT OF THE CHARACTER IN QUESTION
3394-7597-0016 GRADUALLY HOWEVER HE FELL INTO A MORE AND MORE HOPELESS STATE OF STUPOR AND FINALLY IT WAS THOUGHT THAT HE DIED THE WEATHER WAS WARM AND HE WAS BURIED WITH INDECENT HASTE IN ONE OF THE PUBLIC CEMETERIES HIS FUNERAL TOOK PLACE ON THURSDAY ON THE SUNDAY FOLLOWING THE GROUNDS
3394-7597-0017 OF THE CEMETERY WERE AS USUAL MUCH THRONGED WITH VISITERS AND ABOUT NOON AN INTENSE EXCITEMENT WAS CREATED BY THE DECLARATION OF A PEASANT THAT WHILE SITTING UPON THE GRAVE OF THE OFFICER HE HAD DISTINCTLY FELT A COMMOTION OF THE EARTH AS IF OCCASIONED BY SOME ONE STRUGGLING BENEATH
3394-7597-0018 WITH WHICH HE PERSISTED IN HIS STORY HAD AT LENGTH THEIR NATURAL EFFECT UPON THE CROWD SPADES WERE HURRIEDLY PROCURED AND THE GRAVE WHICH WAS SHAMEFULLY SHALLOW WAS IN A FEW MINUTES SO FAR THROWN OPEN THAT THE HEAD OF ITS OCCUPANT APPEARED
3394-7597-0019 FROM WHAT HE RELATED IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF LIFE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR WHILE INHUMED BEFORE LAPSING INTO INSENSIBILITY
3394-7597-0020 THE GRAVE WAS CARELESSLY AND LOOSELY FILLED WITH AN EXCEEDINGLY POROUS SOIL AND THUS SOME AIR WAS NECESSARILY ADMITTED HE HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE CROWD OVERHEAD AND ENDEAVORED TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD IN TURN IT WAS THE TUMULT WITHIN THE GROUNDS OF THE CEMETERY HE SAID
3394-7597-0021 WHICH APPEARED TO AWAKEN HIM FROM A DEEP SLEEP BUT NO SOONER WAS HE AWAKE THAN HE BECAME FULLY AWARE OF THE AWFUL HORRORS OF HIS POSITION THIS PATIENT IT IS RECORDED WAS DOING WELL AND SEEMED TO BE IN A FAIR WAY OF ULTIMATE RECOVERY BUT FELL A VICTIM TO
3394-7597-0022 IT SUPERINDUCES THE MENTION OF THE GALVANIC BATTERY NEVERTHELESS RECALLS TO MY MEMORY A WELL KNOWN AND VERY EXTRAORDINARY CASE IN POINT WHERE ITS ACTION PROVED THE MEANS OF RESTORING TO ANIMATION A YOUNG ATTORNEY OF LONDON
3394-7597-0023 THIS OCCURRED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE AND CREATED AT THE TIME A VERY PROFOUND SENSATION WHEREVER IT WAS MADE THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSE
3394-7597-0024 DISINTER THE BODY AND DISSECT IT AT LEISURE IN PRIVATE ARRANGEMENTS WERE EASILY EFFECTED WITH SOME OF THE NUMEROUS CORPS OF BODY SNATCHERS WITH WHICH LONDON ABOUNDS AND UPON THE THIRD NIGHT AFTER THE FUNERAL
3394-7597-0025 SUPERVENED WITH NOTHING TO CHARACTERIZE THEM IN ANY RESPECT EXCEPT UPON ONE OR TWO OCCASIONS A MORE THAN ORDINARY DEGREE OF LIFE
3394-7597-0026 ONCE TO THE DISSECTION A STUDENT HOWEVER WAS ESPECIALLY DESIROUS OF TESTING A THEORY OF HIS OWN AND INSISTED UPON APPLYING THE BATTERY TO ONE OF THE PECTORAL MUSCLES
3394-7597-0027 THEIR WONDER THEIR RAPTUROUS ASTONISHMENT MAY BE CONCEIVED THE MOST THRILLING PECULIARITY OF THIS INCIDENT NEVERTHELESS IS INVOLVED IN WHAT MISTER S HIMSELF ASSERTS HE DECLARES THAT AT NO PERIOD WAS HE ALTOGETHER INSENSIBLE THAT DULLY AND CONFUSEDLY HE WAS AWARE OF EVERYTHING
3394-7597-0028 TO THAT IN WHICH HE FELL SWOONING TO THE FLOOR OF THE HOSPITAL I AM ALIVE WERE THE UNCOMPREHENDED WORDS WHICH UPON RECOGNIZING THE LOCALITY
3394-7597-0029 WE HAVE IT IN OUR POWER TO DETECT THEM WE MUST ADMIT THAT THEY MAY FREQUENTLY OCCUR WITHOUT OUR COGNIZANCE SCARCELY IN TRUTH IS A GRAVEYARD EVER ENCROACHED UPON FOR ANY PURPOSE TO ANY GREAT EXTENT THAT SKELETONS ARE NOT FOUND IN POSTURES WHICH SUGGEST
3394-7597-0030 THE MOST FEARFUL OF SUSPICIONS FEARFUL INDEED THE SUSPICION BUT MORE FEARFUL THE DOOM IT MAY BE ASSERTED WITHOUT HESITATION THAT NO EVENT IS SO TERRIBLY WELL ADAPTED TO INSPIRE THE SUPREMENESS OF BODILY AND OF MENTAL DISTRESS AS IS BURIAL BEFORE DEATH
3394-7597-0031 THE BLACKNESS OF THE ABSOLUTE NIGHT THE SILENCE LIKE A SEA THAT OVERWHELMS THE UNSEEN BUT PALPABLE PRESENCE OF THE CONQUEROR WORM
3394-7597-0032 AND WITH CONSCIOUSNESS THAT OF THIS FATE THEY CAN NEVER BE INFORMED THAT OUR HOPELESS PORTION IS THAT OF THE REALLY DEAD THESE CONSIDERATIONS I SAY CARRY INTO THE HEART WHICH STILL
3394-7597-0033 WE KNOW OF NOTHING SO AGONIZING UPON EARTH WE CAN DREAM OF NOTHING HALF SO HIDEOUS IN THE REALMS OF THE NETHERMOST HELL
3394-7597-0034 TO TERM CATALEPSY IN DEFAULT OF A MORE DEFINITIVE TITLE ALTHOUGH BOTH THE IMMEDIATE AND THE PREDISPOSING CAUSES AND EVEN THE ACTUAL DIAGNOSIS OF THIS DISEASE ARE STILL MYSTERIOUS ITS OBVIOUS
3394-7597-0035 WE CAN DETECT A TORPID UNEQUAL AND VACILLATING ACTION OF THE LUNGS THEN AGAIN THE DURATION OF THE TRANCE IS FOR WEEKS EVEN FOR MONTHS WHILE THE CLOSEST SCRUTINY AND THE MOST RIGOROUS MEDICAL TESTS FAIL TO ESTABLISH ANY
3394-7597-0036 MATERIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE STATE OF THE SUFFERER AND WHAT WE CONCEIVE OF ABSOLUTE DEATH VERY USUALLY HE IS SAVED FROM PREMATURE INTERMENT SOLELY BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS FRIENDS THAT HE HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUBJECT TO CATALEPSY
3394-7597-0037 BY THE CONSEQUENT SUSPICION EXCITED AND ABOVE ALL BY THE NON APPEARANCE OF DECAY THE ADVANCES OF THE MALADY ARE LUCKILY GRADUAL THE FIRST MANIFESTATIONS ALTHOUGH MARKED ARE UNEQUIVOCAL
3394-7597-0038 THE FITS GROW SUCCESSIVELY MORE AND MORE DISTINCTIVE AND ENDURE EACH FOR A LONGER TERM THAN THE PRECEDING IN THIS LIES THE PRINCIPAL SECURITY FROM INHUMATION
3394-7597-0039 MY OWN CASE DIFFERED IN NO IMPORTANT PARTICULAR FROM THOSE MENTIONED IN MEDICAL BOOKS SOMETIMES WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE I SANK LITTLE BY LITTLE INTO A CONDITION OF HEMI SYNCOPE
3394-7597-0040 SUDDENLY TO PERFECT SENSATION AT OTHER TIMES I WAS QUICKLY AND IMPETUOUSLY SMITTEN I GREW SICK AND NUMB AND CHILLY AND DIZZY AND SO FELL PROSTRATE AT ONCE THEN FOR WEEKS ALL WAS VOID AND BLACK AND SILENT AND NOTHING BECAME THE UNIVERSE
3394-7597-0041 TOTAL ANNIHILATION COULD BE NO MORE FROM THESE LATTER ATTACKS I AWOKE HOWEVER WITH A GRADATION SLOW IN PROPORTION TO THE SUDDENNESS OF THE SEIZURE JUST AS THE DAY DAWNS TO THE FRIENDLESS AND HOUSELESS BEGGAR WHO ROAMS THE STREETS THROUGHOUT THE LONG DESOLATE WINTER NIGHT
3394-7597-0042 JUST SO TARDILY JUST SO WEARILY JUST SO CHEERILY CAME BACK THE LIGHT OF THE SOUL TO ME APART FROM THE TENDENCY TO TRANCE HOWEVER MY GENERAL HEALTH APPEARED TO BE GOOD NOR COULD I PERCEIVE THAT IT WAS
3394-7597-0043 AT ALL AFFECTED BY THE ONE PREVALENT MALADY UNLESS INDEED AN IDIOSYNCRASY IN MY ORDINARY SLEEP MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS SUPERINDUCED UPON AWAKING FROM SLUMBER
3394-7597-0044 IN ALL THAT I ENDURED THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL SUFFERING BUT OF MORAL DISTRESS AN INFINITUDE MY FANCY GREW CHARNEL I TALKED OF WORMS OF TOMBS AND EPITAPHS I WAS LOST IN REVERIES OF DEATH
3394-7597-0045 WHEN NATURE COULD ENDURE WAKEFULNESS NO LONGER
3394-7597-0046 IT WAS ONLY TO RUSH AT ONCE INTO A WORLD OF PHANTASMS ABOVE WHICH WITH VAST SABLE OVERSHADOWING WING
3394-7597-0047 FROM THE INNUMERABLE IMAGES OF GLOOM WHICH THUS OPPRESSED ME IN DREAMS I SELECT FOR RECORD BUT A SOLITARY VISION
3394-7597-0048 WHILE THE GIBBERING VOICE SAID AGAIN ARISE DID I NOT BID THEE ARISE AND WHO I DEMANDED ART THOU I HAVE NO NAME IN THE REGIONS WHICH I INHABIT REPLIED THE VOICE MOURNFULLY I WAS MORTAL BUT AM FIEND I WAS MERCILESS BUT AM PITIFUL
3394-7597-0049 THOU DOST FEEL THAT I SHUDDER MY TEETH CHATTER AS I SPEAK
3394-7597-0050 HOW CANST THOU TRANQUILLY SLEEP I CANNOT REST FOR THE CRY OF THESE GREAT AGONIES THESE SIGHTS ARE MORE THAN I CAN BEAR GET THEE UP
3394-7597-0051 IS NOT THIS A SPECTACLE OF WOE BEHOLD I LOOKED AND THE UNSEEN FIGURE WHICH STILL GRASPED ME BY THE WRIST HAD CAUSED TO BE THROWN OPEN THE GRAVES OF ALL MANKIND AND FROM EACH ISSUED THE FAINT PHOSPHORIC RADIANCE OF DECAY
3394-7597-0052 SO THAT I COULD SEE INTO THE INNERMOST RECESSES AND THERE VIEW THE SHROUDED BODIES IN THEIR SAD AND SOLEMN SLUMBERS
3394-7597-0053 AND THERE WAS A FEEBLE STRUGGLING AND THERE WAS A GENERAL SAD UNREST AND FROM OUT THE DEPTHS OF THE COUNTLESS PITS THERE CAME A MELANCHOLY RUSTLING FROM THE GARMENTS OF THE BURIED AND OF THOSE WHO SEEMED TRANQUILLY TO REPOSE I SAW THAT A VAST NUMBER HAD CHANGED
3394-7597-0054 SAID TO ME AS I GAZED IS IT NOT OH IS IT NOT A PITIFUL SIGHT BUT BEFORE I COULD FIND WORDS TO REPLY THE FIGURE HAD CEASED TO GRASP MY WRIST THE PHOSPHORIC LIGHTS EXPIRED AND THE GRAVES WERE CLOSED WITH A SUDDEN VIOLENCE WHILE FROM OUT
3394-7597-0055 THEM AROSE A TUMULT OF DESPAIRING CRIES SAYING AGAIN IS IT NOT O GOD IS IT NOT A VERY PITIFUL SIGHT PHANTASIES SUCH AS THESE PRESENTING THEMSELVES AT NIGHT EXTENDED THEIR TERRIFIC INFLUENCE FAR INTO MY WAKING HOURS
3394-7597-0056 MY NERVES BECAME THOROUGHLY UNSTRUNG AND I FELL A PREY TO PERPETUAL HORROR I HESITATED TO RIDE OR TO WALK OR TO INDULGE IN ANY EXERCISE THAT WOULD CARRY ME FROM HOME IN FACT I NO LONGER DARED TRUST MYSELF OUT OF THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF THOSE
3394-7597-0057 WHO WERE AWARE OF MY PRONENESS TO CATALEPSY LEST FALLING INTO ONE OF MY USUAL FITS I SHOULD BE BURIED BEFORE MY REAL CONDITION COULD BE ASCERTAINED I DOUBTED THE CARE THE FIDELITY OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS I DREADED THAT IN SOME TRANCE
3394-7597-0058 OF MORE THAN CUSTOMARY DURATION THEY MIGHT BE PREVAILED UPON TO REGARD ME AS IRRECOVERABLE I EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO FEAR THAT AS I OCCASIONED MUCH TROUBLE THEY MIGHT BE GLAD TO CONSIDER ANY VERY PROTRACTED ATTACK AS SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR GETTING RID OF ME ALTOGETHER
3394-7597-0059 I EXACTED THE MOST SACRED OATHS THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WOULD BURY ME UNTIL DECOMPOSITION HAD SO MATERIALLY ADVANCED
3394-7597-0060 IRON PORTAL TO FLY BACK THERE WERE ARRANGEMENTS ALSO FOR THE FREE ADMISSION OF AIR AND LIGHT AND CONVENIENT RECEPTACLES FOR FOOD AND WATER WITHIN IMMEDIATE REACH OF THE COFFIN INTENDED FOR MY RECEPTION THIS COFFIN WAS WARMLY AND SOFTLY PADDED AND WAS PROVIDED WITH A LID
3394-7597-0061 FASHIONED UPON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE VAULT DOOR
3394-7597-0062 THERE ARRIVED AN EPOCH AS OFTEN BEFORE
3394-7597-0063 SLOWLY WITH A TORTOISE GRADATION APPROACHED THE FAINT GRAY DAWN OF THE PSYCHAL DAY A TORPID UNEASINESS AN APATHETIC ENDURANCE OF DULL PAIN NO CARE NO HOPE NO EFFORT THEN AFTER A LONG INTERVAL A RINGING IN THE EARS
3394-7597-0064 AND IMMEDIATELY THEREUPON AN ELECTRIC SHOCK OF A TERROR DEADLY AND INDEFINITE WHICH SENDS THE BLOOD IN TORRENTS FROM THE TEMPLES TO THE HEART AND NOW THE FIRST POSITIVE EFFORT TO THINK AND NOW THE FIRST ENDEAVOR TO REMEMBER
3394-7597-0065 IT WAS SURE DESPAIR SUCH AS NO OTHER SPECIES OF WRETCHEDNESS EVER CALLS INTO BEING DESPAIR ALONE URGED ME
3394-7597-0066 ALL DARK I KNEW THAT THE FIT WAS OVER I KNEW THAT THE CRISIS OF MY DISORDER HAD LONG PASSED
3394-7597-0067 VISUAL FACULTIES AND YET IT WAS DARK ALL DARK THE INTENSE AND UTTER RAYLESSNESS OF THE NIGHT THAT ENDURETH FOR EVERMORE I ENDEAVORED TO SHRIEK AND MY LIPS AND MY PARCHED TONGUE MOVED CONVULSIVELY
3394-7597-0068 TOGETHER IN THE ATTEMPT BUT NO VOICE ISSUED FROM THE CAVERNOUS LUNGS WHICH OPPRESSED AS IF BY THE WEIGHT OF SOME INCUMBENT MOUNTAIN GASPED AND PALPITATED WITH THE HEART AT EVERY ELABORATE AND STRUGGLING INSPIRATION THE MOVEMENT OF THE JAWS IN THIS EFFORT TO CRY ALOUD SHOWED
3394-7597-0069 AND MADE SPASMODIC EXERTIONS TO FORCE OPEN THE LID IT WOULD NOT MOVE I FELT MY WRISTS FOR THE BELL ROPE IT WAS NOT TO BE FOUND AND NOW THE COMFORTER FLED FOR EVER
3394-7597-0070 FORCED ITSELF THUS INTO THE INNERMOST CHAMBERS OF MY SOUL I ONCE AGAIN STRUGGLED TO CRY ALOUD
3394-7597-0071 WHAT THE DEVIL'S THE MATTER NOW SAID A SECOND GET OUT O THAT SAID A THIRD WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY YOWLING IN THAT ERE KIND OF STYLE LIKE A CATTYMOUNT SAID A FOURTH AND HEREUPON I WAS SEIZED AND SHAKEN WITHOUT CEREMONY
3394-7597-0072 ONLY TWO BERTHS IN THE VESSEL AND THE BERTHS OF A SLOOP OF SIXTY OR TWENTY TONS NEED SCARCELY BE DESCRIBED THAT WHICH I OCCUPIED HAD NO BEDDING OF ANY KIND ITS EXTREME WIDTH WAS EIGHTEEN INCHES THE DISTANCE OF ITS BOTTOM
3394-7597-0073 FROM MY ORDINARY BIAS OF THOUGHT AND FROM THE DIFFICULTY TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED OF COLLECTING MY SENSES AND ESPECIALLY OF REGAINING MY MEMORY FOR A LONG TIME AFTER AWAKING FROM SLUMBER THE MEN WHO SHOOK ME
3394-7597-0074 WERE THE CREW OF THE SLOOP AND SOME LABORERS ENGAGED TO UNLOAD IT FROM THE LOAD ITSELF CAME THE EARTHLY SMELL THE BANDAGE ABOUT THE JAWS WAS A SILK HANDKERCHIEF IN WHICH I HAD BOUND UP MY HEAD IN DEFAULT OF MY CUSTOMARY NIGHTCAP
3394-7597-0075 THE TORTURES ENDURED HOWEVER WERE INDUBITABLY QUITE EQUAL FOR THE TIME TO THOSE OF ACTUAL SEPULTURE
3394-7597-0076 MY SOUL ACQUIRED TONE ACQUIRED TEMPER I WENT ABROAD I TOOK VIGOROUS EXERCISE I BREATHED THE FREE AIR OF HEAVEN I THOUGHT UPON OTHER SUBJECTS THAN DEATH I DISCARDED MY MEDICAL BOOKS
3394-7597-0077 I READ NO NIGHT THOUGHTS NO FUSTIAN ABOUT CHURCHYARDS NO BUGABOO TALES SUCH AS THIS IN SHORT I BECAME A NEW MAN AND LIVED A MAN'S LIFE FROM THAT MEMORABLE NIGHT I DISMISSED FOREVER MY
3394-7597-0078 CHARNEL APPREHENSIONS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE CATALEPTIC DISORDER OF WHICH PERHAPS THEY HAD BEEN LESS THE CONSEQUENCE THAN THE CAUSE THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN EVEN TO THE SOBER EYE OF REASON THE WORLD OF OUR SAD HUMANITY
3394-7597-0079 BUT THE IMAGINATION OF MAN IS NO CARATHIS TO EXPLORE WITH IMPUNITY ITS EVERY CAVERN ALAS THE GRIM LEGION OF SEPULCHRAL TERRORS CANNOT BE REGARDED AS ALTOGETHER FANCIFUL BUT LIKE THE DEMONS IN WHOSE COMPANY AFRASIAB MADE HIS VOYAGE DOWN THE OXUS
3394-7597-0080 THEY MUST SLEEP OR THEY WILL DEVOUR US THEY MUST BE SUFFERED TO SLUMBER
