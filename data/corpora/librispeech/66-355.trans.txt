66-355-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT WE PASSED A FEW SAD HOURS UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO COMMENCE MY FATHER AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY BEING OBLIGED TO ATTEND AS WITNESSES I ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE COURT
66-355-0001 THE OTHER FAR MORE DREADFULLY MURDERED WITH EVERY AGGRAVATION OF INFAMY THAT COULD MAKE THE MURDER MEMORABLE IN HORROR JUSTINE ALSO WAS A GIRL OF MERIT AND POSSESSED QUALITIES WHICH PROMISED TO RENDER HER LIFE HAPPY NOW
66-355-0002 IN AN IGNOMINIOUS GRAVE AND I THE CAUSE A THOUSAND TIMES RATHER WOULD I HAVE CONFESSED MYSELF GUILTY OF THE CRIME ASCRIBED TO JUSTINE BUT I WAS ABSENT WHEN IT WAS COMMITTED AND SUCH A DECLARATION WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE RAVINGS OF A MADMAN
66-355-0003 THE APPEARANCE OF JUSTINE WAS CALM SHE WAS DRESSED IN MOURNING AND HER COUNTENANCE ALWAYS ENGAGING WAS RENDERED BY THE SOLEMNITY OF HER FEELINGS EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL
66-355-0004 YET SHE APPEARED CONFIDENT IN INNOCENCE AND DID NOT TREMBLE ALTHOUGH GAZED ON AND EXECRATED BY THOUSANDS FOR ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH HER BEAUTY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE EXCITED WAS OBLITERATED IN THE MINDS OF THE SPECTATORS
66-355-0005 SHE WORKED UP HER MIND TO AN APPEARANCE OF COURAGE WHEN SHE ENTERED THE COURT SHE THREW HER EYES ROUND IT AND QUICKLY DISCOVERED WHERE WE WERE SEATED A TEAR SEEMED TO DIM HER EYE WHEN SHE SAW US BUT SHE QUICKLY RECOVERED HERSELF
66-355-0006 AND A LOOK OF SORROWFUL AFFECTION SEEMED TO ATTEST HER UTTER GUILTLESSNESS THE TRIAL BEGAN AND AFTER THE ADVOCATE AGAINST HER HAD STATED THE CHARGE SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED SEVERAL STRANGE FACTS COMBINED AGAINST HER
66-355-0007 WHICH MIGHT HAVE STAGGERED ANYONE WHO HAD NOT SUCH PROOF OF HER INNOCENCE AS I HAD SHE HAD BEEN OUT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND TOWARDS MORNING HAD BEEN PERCEIVED BY A MARKET WOMAN
66-355-0008 NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY OF THE MURDERED CHILD HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS FOUND THE WOMAN ASKED HER WHAT SHE DID THERE BUT SHE LOOKED VERY STRANGELY AND ONLY RETURNED A CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWER SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK
66-355-0009 AND WHEN ONE INQUIRED WHERE SHE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT SHE REPLIED THAT SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THE CHILD AND DEMANDED EARNESTLY IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD CONCERNING HIM WHEN SHOWN THE BODY SHE FELL INTO VIOLENT HYSTERICS AND KEPT HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS
66-355-0010 THE PICTURE WAS THEN PRODUCED WHICH THE SERVANT HAD FOUND IN HER POCKET AND WHEN ELIZABETH IN A FALTERING VOICE PROVED THAT IT WAS THE SAME WHICH AN HOUR BEFORE THE CHILD HAD BEEN MISSED SHE HAD PLACED ROUND HIS NECK
66-355-0011 A MURMUR OF HORROR AND INDIGNATION FILLED THE COURT JUSTINE WAS CALLED ON FOR HER DEFENCE AS THE TRIAL HAD PROCEEDED HER COUNTENANCE HAD ALTERED SURPRISE
66-355-0012 HORROR AND MISERY WERE STRONGLY EXPRESSED SOMETIMES SHE STRUGGLED WITH HER TEARS BUT WHEN SHE WAS DESIRED TO PLEAD SHE COLLECTED HER POWERS AND SPOKE IN AN AUDIBLE
66-355-0013 GOD KNOWS SHE SAID HOW ENTIRELY I AM INNOCENT BUT I DO NOT PRETEND THAT MY PROTESTATIONS SHOULD ACQUIT ME
66-355-0014 I REST MY INNOCENCE ON A PLAIN AND SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDUCED AGAINST ME AND I HOPE THE CHARACTER I HAVE ALWAYS BORNE WILL INCLINE MY JUDGES TO A FAVOURABLE INTERPRETATION WHERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE APPEARS DOUBTFUL OR SUSPICIOUS
66-355-0015 SHE THEN RELATED THAT BY THE PERMISSION OF ELIZABETH SHE HAD PASSED THE EVENING OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AT THE HOUSE OF AN AUNT AT CHENE
66-355-0016 BELONGING TO A COTTAGE BEING UNWILLING TO CALL UP THE INHABITANTS TO WHOM SHE WAS WELL KNOWN MOST OF THE NIGHT SHE SPENT HERE WATCHING TOWARDS MORNING SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE SLEPT FOR A FEW MINUTES SOME STEPS DISTURBED HER AND SHE AWOKE
66-355-0017 IT WAS DAWN AND SHE QUITTED HER ASYLUM THAT SHE MIGHT AGAIN ENDEAVOUR TO FIND MY BROTHER IF SHE HAD GONE NEAR THE SPOT WHERE HIS BODY LAY IT WAS WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEWILDERED WHEN QUESTIONED BY THE MARKET WOMAN WAS NOT SURPRISING
66-355-0018 HOW HEAVILY AND FATALLY THIS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WEIGHS AGAINST ME BUT I HAVE NO POWER OF EXPLAINING IT AND WHEN I HAVE EXPRESSED MY UTTER IGNORANCE I AM ONLY LEFT TO CONJECTURE CONCERNING THE PROBABILITIES BY WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN MY POCKET
66-355-0019 BUT HERE ALSO I AM CHECKED I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NO ENEMY ON EARTH AND NONE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WICKED AS TO DESTROY ME WANTONLY DID THE MURDERER PLACE IT THERE I KNOW OF NO OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED HIM FOR SO DOING
66-355-0020 OR IF I HAD WHY SHOULD HE HAVE STOLEN THE JEWEL TO PART WITH IT AGAIN SO SOON I COMMIT MY CAUSE TO THE JUSTICE OF MY JUDGES YET I SEE NO ROOM FOR HOPE
66-355-0021 I BEG PERMISSION TO HAVE A FEW WITNESSES EXAMINED CONCERNING MY CHARACTER AND IF THEIR TESTIMONY SHALL NOT OVERWEIGH MY SUPPOSED GUILT I MUST BE CONDEMNED ALTHOUGH I WOULD PLEDGE MY SALVATION ON MY INNOCENCE
66-355-0022 SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED WHO HAD KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY SPOKE WELL OF HER BUT FEAR AND HATRED OF THE CRIME OF WHICH THEY SUPPOSED HER GUILTY RENDERED THEM TIMOROUS AND UNWILLING TO COME FORWARD
66-355-0023 ELIZABETH SAW EVEN THIS LAST RESOURCE HER EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS AND IRREPROACHABLE CONDUCT ABOUT TO FAIL THE ACCUSED WHEN ALTHOUGH VIOLENTLY AGITATED SHE DESIRED PERMISSION TO ADDRESS THE COURT
66-355-0024 I AM SAID SHE THE COUSIN OF THE UNHAPPY CHILD WHO WAS MURDERED OR RATHER HIS SISTER FOR I WAS EDUCATED BY AND HAVE LIVED WITH HIS PARENTS EVER SINCE AND EVEN LONG BEFORE HIS BIRTH IT MAY THEREFORE BE
66-355-0025 JUDGED INDECENT IN ME TO COME FORWARD ON THIS OCCASION BUT WHEN I SEE A FELLOW CREATURE ABOUT TO PERISH THROUGH THE COWARDICE OF HER PRETENDED FRIENDS I WISH TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK THAT I MAY SAY WHAT I KNOW OF HER CHARACTER
66-355-0026 I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ACCUSED I HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER AT ONE TIME FOR FIVE AND AT ANOTHER FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS DURING ALL THAT PERIOD SHE APPEARED TO ME THE MOST AMIABLE AND BENEVOLENT OF HUMAN CREATURES
66-355-0027 SHE NURSED MADAME FRANKENSTEIN MY AUNT IN HER LAST ILLNESS WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION AND CARE AND AFTERWARDS ATTENDED HER OWN MOTHER DURING A TEDIOUS ILLNESS IN A MANNER THAT EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO KNEW HER
66-355-0028 THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED AGAINST HER I BELIEVE AND RELY ON HER PERFECT INNOCENCE SHE HAD NO TEMPTATION FOR SUCH AN ACTION AS TO THE BAUBLE ON WHICH THE CHIEF PROOF RESTS
66-355-0029 I SHOULD HAVE WILLINGLY GIVEN IT TO HER SO MUCH DO I ESTEEM AND VALUE HER A MURMUR OF APPROBATION FOLLOWED ELIZABETH'S SIMPLE AND POWERFUL APPEAL BUT IT WAS EXCITED BY HER GENEROUS INTERFERENCE AND NOT IN FAVOUR OF POOR JUSTINE
66-355-0030 ON WHOM THE PUBLIC INDIGNATION WAS TURNED WITH RENEWED VIOLENCE CHARGING HER WITH THE BLACKEST INGRATITUDE SHE HERSELF WEPT AS ELIZABETH SPOKE BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER MY OWN AGITATION AND ANGUISH WAS EXTREME DURING THE WHOLE TRIAL
66-355-0031 I BELIEVED IN HER INNOCENCE I KNEW IT COULD THE DEMON WHO HAD
66-355-0032 HAD ALREADY CONDEMNED MY UNHAPPY VICTIM I RUSHED OUT OF THE COURT IN AGONY THE TORTURES OF THE ACCUSED DID NOT EQUAL MINE SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY INNOCENCE BUT THE FANGS OF REMORSE TORE MY BOSOM AND WOULD NOT FORGO THEIR HOLD
66-355-0033 I PASSED A NIGHT OF UNMINGLED WRETCHEDNESS IN THE MORNING I WENT TO THE COURT MY LIPS AND THROAT WERE PARCHED I DARED NOT ASK THE FATAL QUESTION BUT I WAS KNOWN
66-355-0034 AND THE OFFICER GUESSED THE CAUSE OF MY VISIT THE BALLOTS HAD BEEN THROWN THEY WERE ALL BLACK AND JUSTINE WAS CONDEMNED I CANNOT PRETEND TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THEN FELT I HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED SENSATIONS OF HORROR
66-355-0035 BUT WORDS CANNOT CONVEY AN IDEA OF THE HEART SICKENING DESPAIR THAT I THEN ENDURED THE PERSON TO WHOM I ADDRESSED MYSELF ADDED THAT JUSTINE HAD ALREADY CONFESSED HER GUILT THAT EVIDENCE HE OBSERVED
66-355-0036 WAS HARDLY REQUIRED IN SO GLARING A CASE BUT I AM GLAD OF IT AND INDEED NONE OF OUR JUDGES LIKE TO CONDEMN A CRIMINAL UPON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE BE IT EVER SO DECISIVE THIS WAS STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE
66-355-0037 WHAT COULD IT MEAN HAD MY EYES DECEIVED ME AND WAS I REALLY AS MAD AS THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BELIEVE ME TO BE IF I DISCLOSED THE OBJECT OF MY SUSPICIONS I HASTENED TO RETURN HOME AND ELIZABETH EAGERLY DEMANDED THE RESULT
66-355-0038 MY COUSIN REPLIED I IT IS DECIDED AS YOU MAY HAVE EXPECTED ALL JUDGES HAD RATHER THAT TEN INNOCENT SHOULD SUFFER THAN THAT ONE GUILTY SHOULD ESCAPE BUT SHE HAS CONFESSED
66-355-0039 THIS WAS A DIRE BLOW TO POOR ELIZABETH
66-355-0040 ALAS SAID SHE HOW SHALL I EVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN HUMAN GOODNESS JUSTINE WHOM I LOVED AND ESTEEMED AS MY SISTER HOW COULD SHE PUT ON THOSE SMILES OF INNOCENCE ONLY TO BETRAY HER MILD EYES SEEMED INCAPABLE OF ANY SEVERITY OR GUILE
66-355-0041 AND YET SHE HAS COMMITTED A MURDER SOON AFTER WE HEARD THAT THE POOR VICTIM HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE MY COUSIN MY FATHER WISHED HER NOT TO GO BUT SAID THAT HE LEFT IT TO HER OWN JUDGMENT AND FEELINGS TO DECIDE
66-355-0042 YES SAID ELIZABETH I WILL GO ALTHOUGH SHE IS GUILTY AND YOU VICTOR SHALL ACCOMPANY ME I CANNOT GO ALONE THE IDEA OF THIS VISIT WAS TORTURE TO ME YET I COULD NOT REFUSE
66-355-0043 SHE THREW HERSELF AT THE FEET OF ELIZABETH WEEPING BITTERLY MY COUSIN WEPT ALSO OH JUSTINE SAID SHE WHY DID YOU ROB ME OF MY LAST CONSOLATION I RELIED ON YOUR INNOCENCE AND ALTHOUGH I WAS THEN VERY WRETCHED
66-355-0044 I WAS NOT SO MISERABLE AS I AM NOW AND DO YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT I AM SO VERY VERY WICKED DO YOU ALSO JOIN WITH MY ENEMIES TO CRUSH ME TO CONDEMN ME AS A MURDERER HER VOICE WAS SUFFOCATED WITH SOBS
66-355-0045 RISE MY POOR GIRL SAID ELIZABETH WHY DO YOU KNEEL IF YOU ARE INNOCENT I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES I BELIEVED YOU GUILTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY EVIDENCE UNTIL I HEARD THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF DECLARED YOUR GUILT
66-355-0046 THAT REPORT YOU SAY IS FALSE AND BE ASSURED DEAR JUSTINE THAT NOTHING CAN SHAKE MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU FOR A MOMENT BUT YOUR OWN CONFESSION I DID CONFESS BUT I CONFESSED A LIE
66-355-0047 I CONFESSED THAT I MIGHT OBTAIN ABSOLUTION BUT NOW THAT FALSEHOOD LIES HEAVIER AT MY HEART THAN ALL MY OTHER SINS THE GOD OF HEAVEN FORGIVE ME EVER SINCE I WAS CONDEMNED MY CONFESSOR HAS BESIEGED ME
66-355-0048 HE THREATENED AND MENACED UNTIL I ALMOST BEGAN TO THINK THAT I WAS THE MONSTER THAT HE SAID I WAS HE THREATENED EXCOMMUNICATION AND HELL FIRE IN MY LAST MOMENTS IF I CONTINUED OBDURATE
66-355-0049 ALL LOOKED ON ME AS A WRETCH DOOMED TO IGNOMINY AND PERDITION WHAT COULD I DO IN AN EVIL HOUR I SUBSCRIBED TO A LIE AND NOW ONLY AM I TRULY MISERABLE SHE PAUSED WEEPING
66-355-0050 AND THEN CONTINUED I THOUGHT WITH HORROR MY SWEET LADY
66-355-0051 AND WHOM YOU LOVED WAS A CREATURE CAPABLE OF A CRIME WHICH NONE BUT THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD HAVE PERPETRATED DEAR WILLIAM
66-355-0052 I SOON SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN IN HEAVEN WHERE WE SHALL ALL BE HAPPY AND THAT CONSOLES ME GOING AS I AM TO SUFFER IGNOMINY AND DEATH OH JUSTINE
66-355-0053 FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING FOR ONE MOMENT DISTRUSTED YOU WHY DID YOU CONFESS BUT DO NOT MOURN DEAR GIRL DO NOT FEAR I WILL PROCLAIM I WILL PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE I WILL MELT THE STONY HEARTS OF YOUR ENEMIES
66-355-0054 BY MY TEARS AND PRAYERS YOU SHALL NOT DIE YOU MY PLAYFELLOW MY COMPANION
66-355-0055 JUSTINE SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY I DO NOT FEAR TO DIE SHE SAID THAT PANG IS PAST GOD RAISES MY WEAKNESS AND GIVES ME COURAGE TO ENDURE THE WORST
66-355-0056 DURING THIS CONVERSATION I HAD RETIRED TO A CORNER OF THE PRISON ROOM WHERE I COULD CONCEAL THE HORRID ANGUISH THAT POSSESSED ME DESPAIR WHO DARED TALK OF THAT
66-355-0057 THE POOR VICTIM WHO ON THE MORROW WAS TO PASS THE AWFUL BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FELT NOT AS I DID SUCH DEEP AND BITTER AGONY I GNASHED MY TEETH AND GROUND THEM TOGETHER
66-355-0058 JUSTINE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW WHO IT WAS SHE APPROACHED ME AND SAID DEAR SIR
66-355-0059 I COULD NOT ANSWER NO JUSTINE SAID ELIZABETH HE IS MORE CONVINCED OF YOUR INNOCENCE THAN I WAS FOR EVEN WHEN HE HEARD THAT YOU HAD CONFESSED HE DID NOT CREDIT IT I TRULY THANK HIM
66-355-0060 IN THESE LAST MOMENTS I FEEL THE SINCEREST GRATITUDE TOWARDS THOSE WHO THINK OF ME WITH KINDNESS HOW SWEET IS THE AFFECTION OF OTHERS TO SUCH A WRETCH AS I AM IT REMOVES MORE THAN HALF MY MISFORTUNE
66-355-0061 AND I FEEL AS IF I COULD DIE IN PEACE NOW THAT MY INNOCENCE IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY YOU DEAR LADY AND YOUR COUSIN THUS THE POOR SUFFERER TRIED TO COMFORT OTHERS AND HERSELF
66-355-0062 SHE INDEED GAINED THE RESIGNATION SHE DESIRED BUT I THE TRUE MURDERER FELT THE NEVER DYING WORM ALIVE IN MY BOSOM WHICH ALLOWED OF NO HOPE OR CONSOLATION ELIZABETH ALSO WEPT AND WAS UNHAPPY
66-355-0063 I BORE A HELL WITHIN ME WHICH NOTHING COULD EXTINGUISH WE STAYED SEVERAL HOURS WITH JUSTINE AND IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT ELIZABETH COULD TEAR HERSELF AWAY I WISH CRIED SHE THAT I WERE TO DIE WITH YOU
66-355-0064 I CANNOT LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF MISERY JUSTINE ASSUMED AN AIR OF CHEERFULNESS WHILE SHE WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSED HER BITTER TEARS SHE EMBRACED ELIZABETH AND SAID IN A VOICE OF HALF SUPPRESSED EMOTION
66-355-0065 FAREWELL SWEET LADY DEAREST ELIZABETH MY BELOVED AND ONLY FRIEND MAY HEAVEN IN ITS BOUNTY BLESS AND PRESERVE YOU MAY THIS BE THE LAST MISFORTUNE THAT YOU WILL EVER SUFFER LIVE AND BE HAPPY
66-355-0066 AND MAKE OTHERS SO AND ON THE MORROW JUSTINE DIED ELIZABETH'S HEART RENDING ELOQUENCE FAILED TO MOVE THE JUDGES FROM THEIR SETTLED CONVICTION IN THE CRIMINALITY OF THE SAINTLY SUFFERER
66-355-0067 AND HEARD THE HARSH UNFEELING REASONING OF THESE MEN MY PURPOSED AVOWAL DIED AWAY ON MY LIPS THUS I MIGHT PROCLAIM MYSELF A MADMAN BUT NOT REVOKE THE SENTENCE PASSED UPON MY WRETCHED VICTIM SHE PERISHED ON THE SCAFFOLD
66-355-0068 AS A MURDERESS FROM THE TORTURES OF MY OWN HEART I TURNED TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEEP AND VOICELESS GRIEF OF MY ELIZABETH THIS ALSO WAS MY DOING AND MY FATHER'S WOE AND THE DESOLATION OF THAT LATE SO SMILING HOME
