1618-32403-0000 AVOID A SUCCESSION OF LOOSE SENTENCES THIS RULE REFERS ESPECIALLY TO LOOSE SENTENCES OF A PARTICULAR TYPE THOSE CONSISTING OF TWO CO ORDINATE CLAUSES
1618-32403-0001 THE SECOND INTRODUCED BY A CONJUNCTION OR RELATIVE ALTHOUGH SINGLE SENTENCES OF THIS TYPE MAY BE UNEXCEPTIONABLE SEE UNDER RULE FOUR A SERIES SOON BECOMES MONOTONOUS
1618-32403-0002 AND TEDIOUS AN UNSKILFUL WRITER WILL SOMETIMES CONSTRUCT A WHOLE PARAGRAPH OF SENTENCES OF THIS KIND USING AS CONNECTIVES
1618-32403-0003 WHICH WHEN WHERE AND WHILE THESE LAST IN NON RESTRICTIVE SENSES SEE UNDER RULE THREE THE THIRD CONCERT OF THE SUBSCRIPTION SERIES WAS GIVEN LAST EVENING
1618-32403-0004 AND A LARGE AUDIENCE WAS IN ATTENDANCE MISTER EDWARD APPLETON WAS THE SOLOIST AND THE BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA FURNISHED THE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC THE FORMER SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE AN ARTIST OF THE FIRST RANK
1618-32403-0005 THE INTEREST AROUSED BY THE SERIES HAS BEEN VERY GRATIFYING TO THE COMMITTEE AND IT IS PLANNED TO GIVE A SIMILAR SERIES ANNUALLY HEREAFTER THE FOURTH CONCERT WILL BE GIVEN ON TUESDAY MAY TENTH
1618-32403-0006 WHEN AN EQUALLY ATTRACTIVE PROGRAMME WILL BE PRESENTED APART FROM ITS TRITENESS AND EMPTINESS
1618-32403-0007 BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF ITS SENTENCES WITH THEIR MECHANICAL SYMMETRY AND SING SONG CONTRAST WITH THEM
1618-32403-0008 OR IN ANY PIECE OF GOOD ENGLISH PROSE AS THE PREFACE BEFORE THE CURTAIN TO VANITY FAIR IF THE WRITER FINDS THAT HE HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SENTENCES OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED
1618-32403-0009 TO REMOVE THE MONOTONY REPLACING THEM BY SIMPLE SENTENCES BY SENTENCES OF TWO CLAUSES JOINED BY A SEMICOLON BY PERIODIC SENTENCES OF TWO CLAUSES
1618-32403-0010 BY SENTENCES LOOSE OR PERIODIC OF THREE CLAUSES WHICHEVER BEST REPRESENT THE REAL RELATIONS OF THE THOUGHT FIFTEEN EXPRESS CO ORDINATE IDEAS
1618-32403-0011 IN SIMILAR FORM THIS PRINCIPLE THAT OF PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION REQUIRES THAT EXPRESSIONS OF SIMILAR CONTENT AND FUNCTION SHOULD BE OUTWARDLY SIMILAR
1618-32403-0012 THE LIKENESS OF FORM ENABLES THE READER TO RECOGNIZE MORE READILY THE LIKENESS OF CONTENT AND FUNCTION FAMILIAR INSTANCES FROM THE BIBLE ARE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THE BEATITUDES
1618-32403-0013 AND THE PETITIONS OF THE LORD'S PRAYER THE UNSKILLFUL WRITER OFTEN VIOLATES THIS PRINCIPLE FROM A MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT HE SHOULD CONSTANTLY VARY THE FORM OF HIS EXPRESSIONS
1618-32403-0014 IT IS TRUE THAT IN REPEATING A STATEMENT IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE IT HE MAY HAVE NEED TO VARY ITS FORM FOR ILLUSTRATION SEE THE PARAGRAPH FROM STEVENSON
1618-32403-0015 BUT APART FROM THIS HE SHOULD FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLE OF PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION
1618-32403-0016 THE LEFT HAND VERSION GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE WRITER IS UNDECIDED OR TIMID HE SEEMS UNABLE OR AFRAID TO CHOOSE ONE FORM OF EXPRESSION AND HOLD TO IT THE RIGHT HAND VERSION
1618-32403-0017 SHOWS THAT THE WRITER HAS AT LEAST MADE HIS CHOICE AND ABIDED BY IT BY THIS PRINCIPLE
1618-32403-0018 APPLYING TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF A SERIES
1618-32403-0019 AND THE PORTUGUESE
1618-32403-0020 CORRELATIVE EXPRESSIONS BOTH AND NOT BUT NOT ONLY BUT ALSO EITHER OR
1618-32403-0021 BUT FOR ACTION EITHER YOU MUST GRANT HIS REQUEST OR INCUR HIS ILL WILL YOU MUST EITHER GRANT HIS REQUEST OR INCUR HIS ILL WILL
1618-32403-0022 THE INJUSTICE OF THE MEASURE
1618-32403-0023 THAT IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
1618-32403-0024 SEE ALSO THE THIRD EXAMPLE UNDER RULE TWELVE AND THE LAST UNDER RULE THIRTEEN IT MAY BE ASKED WHAT IF A WRITER NEEDS TO EXPRESS A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF SIMILAR IDEAS SAY TWENTY
1618-32403-0025 MUST HE WRITE TWENTY CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES OF THE SAME PATTERN ON CLOSER EXAMINATION
1618-32403-0026 THAT HIS TWENTY IDEAS CAN BE CLASSIFIED IN GROUPS AND THAT HE NEED APPLY THE PRINCIPLE ONLY WITHIN EACH GROUP OTHERWISE HE HAD BEST AVOID DIFFICULTY
1618-32403-0027 BY PUTTING HIS STATEMENTS IN THE FORM OF A TABLE SIXTEEN KEEP RELATED WORDS TOGETHER THE POSITION OF THE WORDS IN A SENTENCE
1618-32403-0028 IS THE PRINCIPAL MEANS OF SHOWING THEIR RELATIONSHIP THE WRITER MUST THEREFORE SO FAR AS POSSIBLE BRING TOGETHER THE WORDS AND GROUPS OF WORDS THAT ARE RELATED IN THOUGHT
1618-32403-0029 AND KEEP APART THOSE WHICH ARE NOT SO RELATED THE SUBJECT OF A SENTENCE AND THE PRINCIPAL VERB SHOULD NOT AS A RULE BE SEPARATED BY A PHRASE OR CLAUSE THAT CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO THE BEGINNING
1618-32403-0030 GIVES A MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF THIS CHURCH
1618-32403-0031 IS CHANGED INTO STEEL BY TREATMENT IN A BESSEMER CONVERTER
1618-32403-0032 CAST IRON IS CHANGED INTO STEEL THE OBJECTION IS THAT THE INTERPOSED PHRASE OR CLAUSE NEEDLESSLY INTERRUPTS THE NATURAL ORDER OF THE MAIN CLAUSE
1618-32403-0033 WHEN THE ORDER IS INTERRUPTED ONLY BY A RELATIVE CLAUSE OR BY AN EXPRESSION IN APPOSITION NOR DOES IT HOLD IN PERIODIC SENTENCES IN WHICH THE INTERRUPTION
1618-32403-0034 IS A DELIBERATELY USED MEANS OF CREATING SUSPENSE SEE EXAMPLES UNDER RULE EIGHTEEN THE RELATIVE PRONOUN SHOULD COME AS A RULE IMMEDIATELY AFTER ITS ANTECEDENT
1618-32403-0035 THAT BODED MISCHIEF
1618-32403-0036 HE PUBLISHED IN HARPER'S MAGAZINE THREE ARTICLES ABOUT HIS ADVENTURES IN SPAIN
1618-32403-0037 WHO BECAME PRESIDENT IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE
1618-32403-0038 HE BECAME PRESIDENT IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IF THE ANTECEDENT CONSISTS OF A GROUP OF WORDS THE RELATIVE COMES AT THE END OF THE GROUP UNLESS THIS WOULD CAUSE AMBIGUITY
1618-32403-0039 A PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE MUCH DEBATED SHERMAN ACT
1618-32403-0040 WHO WAS REGARDED WITH HOSTILITY BY THE WHIGS MODIFIERS SHOULD COME IF POSSIBLE NEXT TO THE WORD THEY MODIFY IF SEVERAL EXPRESSIONS MODIFY THE SAME WORD
1618-32403-0041 THEY SHOULD BE SO ARRANGED THAT NO WRONG RELATION IS SUGGESTED ALL THE MEMBERS WERE NOT PRESENT NOT ALL THE MEMBERS WERE PRESENT HE ONLY FOUND TWO MISTAKES
1618-32403-0042 HE FOUND ONLY TWO MISTAKES
