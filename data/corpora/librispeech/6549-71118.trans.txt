6549-71118-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT IN MERRY ENGLAND WHEN MARIAN RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS SHE FOUND HERSELF ON BOARD SHIP AND A LADY ATTENDING TO HER WANTS WHEN SHE WAS AT LAST ABLE TO ASK HOW SHE CAME THERE
6549-71118-0001 THE LADY NURSE TOLD THE FOLLOWING STORY ON THE EVENING OF HOLY THURSDAY ABOUT THE TIME THE STORM AROSE OUR VESSEL LAY TO OPPOSITE A PLACE ON SAINT MARY'S COAST CALLED PINE BLUFF AND THE MATE PUT OFF IN A BOAT TO LAND A PASSENGER
6549-71118-0002 AS THEY NEARED THE SHORE THEY MET ANOTHER BOAT ROWED BY TWO MEN WHO SEEMED SO ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE OBSERVATION AS TO ROW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD WITHOUT ANSWERING OUR BOAT'S SALUTE OUR MATE THOUGHT VERY STRANGE OF IT AT THE TIME
6549-71118-0003 BUT THE MYSTERIOUS BOAT WAS SWIFTLY HID IN THE DARKNESS AND OUR BOAT REACHED THE LAND THE MATE AND HIS MAN HAD TO HELP TO CARRY THE PASSENGER'S TRUNKS UP TO THE TOP OF THE BLUFF AND A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND
6549-71118-0004 WHERE A CARRIAGE WAS KEPT WAITING FOR HIM AND AFTER THEY HAD PARTED FROM HIM THEY RETURNED DOWN THE BLUFF BY A SHORTER THOUGH STEEPER WAY AND JUST AS THEY REACHED THE BEACH IN THE MOMENTARY LULL OF THE STORM THEY HEARD GROANS
6549-71118-0005 IMMEDIATELY THE MEN CONNECTED THOSE SOUNDS WITH THE STRANGE BOAT THEY HAD SEEN ROW AWAY AND THEY RAISED THE WICK IN THE LANTERN AND THREW ITS LIGHT AROUND AND SOON DISCOVERED YOU UPON THE SANDS MOANING THOUGH NEARLY INSENSIBLE
6549-71118-0006 THEY NATURALLY CONCLUDED THAT YOU HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF THE MEN IN THE BOAT WHO WERE PROBABLY PIRATES THEIR FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO PURSUE THE CARRIAGE AND GET YOU PLACED WITHIN IT AND TAKEN TO SOME FARMHOUSE FOR ASSISTANCE BUT A MOMENT'S REFLECTION CONVINCED THEM
6549-71118-0007 THAT SUCH A PLAN WAS FUTILE AS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERTAKE THE CARRIAGE THERE WAS ALSO NO HOUSE NEAR THE COAST THEY THOUGHT IT LIKELY THAT YOU WERE A STRANGER TO THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY AND IN THE HURRY AND AGITATION OF THE MOMENT
6549-71118-0008 THEY COULD DEVISE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO PUT YOU IN THE BOAT AND BRING YOU ON BOARD THIS VESSEL THAT IS THE WAY YOU CAME HERE THE GRATEFUL GAZE OF MARIAN THANKED THE LADY AND SHE ASKED
6549-71118-0009 RACHEL HOLMES ANSWERED THE LADY BLUSHING GENTLY MY HUSBAND IS A SURGEON IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY HE IS ON LEAVE OF ABSENCE NOW FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAKING ME HOME TO SEE MY FATHER AND MOTHER THEY LIVE IN LONDON I AM OF ENGLISH PARENTAGE
6549-71118-0010 MARIAN FEEBLY PRESSED HER HAND AND THEN SAID YOU ARE VERY GOOD TO ASK ME NO QUESTIONS AND I THANK YOU WITH ALL MY HEART FOR DEAR LADY I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING THE NEXT DAY THE VESSEL WHICH HAD PUT INTO NEW YORK HARBOR ON CALL
6549-71118-0011 SAILED FOR LIVERPOOL MARIAN SLOWLY IMPROVED HER PURPOSES WERE NOT VERY CLEAR OR STRONG YET MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SUFFERING AND EXHAUSTION HAD TEMPORARILY WEAKENED AND OBSCURED HER MIND
6549-71118-0012 HER ONE STRONG IMPULSE WAS TO ESCAPE TO GET AWAY FROM THE SCENES OF SUCH PAINFUL ASSOCIATIONS AND MEMORIES AND TO GO HOME TO TAKE REFUGE IN HER OWN NATIVE LAND THE THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO MARYLAND TO MEET THE ASTONISHMENT THE WONDER
6549-71118-0013 THE CONJECTURES THE INQUIRIES AND PERHAPS THE LEGAL INVESTIGATION THAT MIGHT LEAD TO THE EXPOSURE AND PUNISHMENT OF THURSTON WAS INSUPPORTABLE TO HER HEART NO NO RATHER LET THE WIDTH OF THE OCEAN DIVIDE HER FROM ALL THOSE HORRORS
6549-71118-0014 UNDOUBTEDLY HER FRIENDS BELIEVED HER DEAD LET IT BE SO LET HER REMAIN AS DEAD TO THEM SHE SHOULD LEAVE NO KINDRED BEHIND HER TO SUFFER BY HER LOSS SHOULD WRONG NO HUMAN BEING TRUE THERE WERE MIRIAM AND EDITH
6549-71118-0015 BUT THAT HER HEART WAS EXHAUSTED BY ITS ONE GREAT ALL CONSUMING GRIEF IT MUST HAVE BLED FOR THEM YET THEY HAD ALREADY SUFFERED ALL THEY COULD POSSIBLY SUFFER FROM THE SUPPOSITION OF HER DEATH IT WAS NOW THREE WEEKS SINCE THEY HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HER DEAD
6549-71118-0016 AND DOUBTLESS KIND NATURE HAD ALREADY NURSED THEM INTO RESIGNATION AND CALMNESS THAT WOULD IN TIME BECOME CHEERFULNESS IF SHE SHOULD GO BACK THERE WOULD BE THE SHOCK THE AMAZEMENT THE QUESTIONS THE PROSECUTIONS PERHAPS THE CONVICTION
6549-71118-0017 AND THE SENTENCE AND THE HORRORS OF A STATE PRISON FOR ONE THE LEAST HAIR OF WHOSE HEAD SHE COULD NOT WILLINGLY HURT AND THEN HER OWN EARLY DEATH OR SHOULD SHE SURVIVE HER BLIGHTED LIFE
6549-71118-0018 COULD THESE CONSEQUENCES CONSOLE OR BENEFIT EDITH OR MIRIAM NO NO THEY WOULD AUGMENT GRIEF IT WAS BETTER TO LEAVE THINGS AS THEY WERE BETTER TO REMAIN DEAD TO THEM A DEAD SORROW MIGHT BE FORGOTTEN LIVING ONE NEVER
6549-71118-0019 FOR HERSELF IT WAS BETTER TO TAKE FATE AS SHE FOUND IT TO GO HOME TO ENGLAND AND DEVOTE HER NEWLY RESTORED LIFE AND HER NEWLY ACQUIRED FORTUNE TO THOSE BENEVOLENT OBJECTS THAT HAD SO LATELY OCCUPIED SO LARGE A SHARE OF HER HEART
6549-71118-0020 SOME MEANS ALSO SHOULD BE FOUND WHEN SHE SHOULD GROW STRONGER AND HER POOR HEAD SHOULD BE CLEARER SO THAT SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO THINK TO MAKE EDITH AND MIRIAM THE RECIPIENTS OF ALL THE BENEFIT HER WEALTH COULD POSSIBLY CONFER UPON THEM
6549-71118-0021 AND SO IN RECOLLECTING MEDITATING PLANNING AND TRYING TO REASON CORRECTLY AND TO UNDERSTAND HER EMBARRASSED POSITION AND HER DIFFICULT DUTY PASSED THE DAYS OF HER CONVALESCENCE AS HER MIND CLEARED
6549-71118-0022 THE THOUGHT OF ANGELICA BEGAN TO GIVE HER UNEASINESS SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK OF LEAVING THAT YOUNG LADY EXPOSED TO THE MISFORTUNE OF BECOMING THURSTON'S WIFE AND HER MIND TOILED WITH THE DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF HOW TO SHIELD ANGELICA WITHOUT EXPOSING THURSTON
