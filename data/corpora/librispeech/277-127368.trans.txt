277-127368-0000 HUMPTY DUMPTY HOWEVER THE EGG ONLY GOT LARGER AND LARGER
277-127368-0001 WHEN SHE HAD COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF IT SHE SAW THAT IT HAD EYES AND A NOSE AND MOUTH AND WHEN SHE HAD COME CLOSE TO IT SHE SAW
277-127368-0002 CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY HIMSELF IT CAN'T BE ANYBODY ELSE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I'M AS CERTAIN OF IT
277-127368-0003 AS IF HIS NAME WERE WRITTEN ALL OVER HIS FACE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A HUNDRED TIMES EASILY ON THAT ENORMOUS FACE HUMPTY DUMPTY WAS SITTING WITH
277-127368-0004 HIS LEGS CROSSED LIKE A TURK ON THE TOP OF A HIGH WALL SUCH A NARROW ONE THAT ALICE QUITE WONDERED HOW HE COULD KEEP HIS BALANCE AND
277-127368-0005 AS HIS EYES WERE STEADILY FIXED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND HE DIDN'T TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF HER SHE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A STUFFED FIGURE AFTER ALL
277-127368-0006 AND HOW EXACTLY LIKE AN EGG HE IS SHE SAID ALOUD STANDING WITH HER HANDS READY TO CATCH HIM FOR SHE WAS EVERY MOMENT EXPECTING HIM TO FALL
277-127368-0007 IT'S VERY PROVOKING HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID AFTER A LONG SILENCE LOOKING AWAY FROM ALICE AS HE SPOKE TO BE CALLED AN EGG VERY

277-127368-0009 SHE ADDED HOPING TO TURN HER REMARK INTO A SORT OF A COMPLIMENT SOME PEOPLE SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING AWAY FROM HER AS USUAL HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN A BABY
277-127368-0010 ALICE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS IT WASN'T AT ALL LIKE CONVERSATION SHE THOUGHT AS HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HER IN FACT HIS LAST REMARK WAS
277-127368-0011 EVIDENTLY ADDRESSED TO A TREE SO SHE STOOD AND SOFTLY REPEATED TO HERSELF HUMPTY DUMPTY SAT ON A WALL HUMPTY DUMPTY HAD A GREAT FALL ALL THE KING'S
277-127368-0012 HORSES AND ALL THE KING'S MEN COULDN'T PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY IN HIS PLACE AGAIN THAT LAST LINE IS MUCH TOO LONG FOR THE POETRY SHE ADDED
277-127368-0013 ALMOST OUT LOUD FORGETTING THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY WOULD HEAR HER DON'T STAND THERE CHATTERING TO YOURSELF LIKE THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID LOOKING AT HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
277-127368-0014 BUT TELL ME YOUR NAME AND YOUR BUSINESS MY NAME IS ALICE BUT IT'S A STUPID ENOUGH NAME HUMPTY DUMPTY INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY

277-127368-0018 CRIED HUMPTY DUMPTY
277-127368-0019 ASK ANOTHER DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D BE SAFER DOWN ON THE GROUND
277-127368-0020 ANXIETY FOR THE QUEER CREATURE THAT WALL IS SO VERY NARROW WHAT TREMENDOUSLY EASY RIDDLES YOU ASK HUMPTY DUMPTY GROWLED OUT
277-127368-0021 OF COURSE I DON'T THINK SO WHY IF
277-127368-0022 HUMPTY DUMPTY CRIED BREAKING INTO A SUDDEN PASSION YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING AT DOORS AND BEHIND TREES AND DOWN CHIMNEYS OR YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT

277-127368-0027 AND AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE FELL OFF THE WALL IN DOING SO AND OFFERED ALICE HIS HAND SHE WATCHED HIM A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY AS SHE TOOK IT
277-127368-0028 IF HE SMILED MUCH MORE THE ENDS OF HIS MOUTH MIGHT MEET BEHIND SHE THOUGHT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIS HEAD I'M AFRAID IT WOULD COME OFF

277-127368-0059 BUT GLORY DOESN'T MEAN A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT ALICE OBJECTED WHEN I USE A WORD HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN RATHER A SCORNFUL TONE
277-127368-0060 IT MEANS JUST WHAT
277-127368-0061 NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THE QUESTION IS SAID ALICE WHETHER YOU CAN MAKE WORDS MEAN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
277-127368-0062 ALICE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO SAY ANYTHING SO AFTER A MINUTE HUMPTY DUMPTY BEGAN AGAIN THEY'VE A TEMPER SOME OF THEM
277-127368-0063 PARTICULARLY VERBS THEY'RE THE PROUDEST ADJECTIVES YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH BUT NOT VERBS HOWEVER I CAN MANAGE THE WHOLE LOT OF THEM
277-127368-0064 IMPENETRABILITY THAT'S WHAT I SAY

277-127368-0068 OH SAID ALICE SHE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO MAKE ANY OTHER REMARK AH YOU SHOULD SEE EM
277-127368-0069 HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON WAGGING HIS HEAD GRAVELY FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR TO GET THEIR WAGES YOU KNOW ALICE DIDN'T VENTURE TO ASK WHAT HE PAID THEM WITH
277-127368-0070 JABBERWOCKY LET'S HEAR IT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY I CAN EXPLAIN ALL THE POEMS THAT WERE EVER INVENTED
277-127368-0071 AND A GOOD MANY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTED JUST YET THIS SOUNDED VERY HOPEFUL SO ALICE REPEATED THE FIRST VERSE TWAS BRILLIG
277-127368-0072 AND THE MOME RATHS
277-127368-0073 THERE ARE TWO MEANINGS PACKED UP INTO ONE WORD I SEE IT NOW ALICE REMARKED THOUGHTFULLY AND WHAT ARE TOVES
277-127368-0074 ARE SOMETHING LIKE BADGERS

277-127368-0077 GYROSCOPE TO GIMBLE
277-127368-0078 IS THE GRASS PLOT ROUND A SUN DIAL I SUPPOSE SAID ALICE SURPRISED AT HER OWN INGENUITY
277-127368-0079 AND A LONG WAY BEYOND IT ON EACH SIDE ALICE ADDED EXACTLY SO
277-127368-0080 THERE'S ANOTHER PORTMANTEAU FOR YOU
277-127368-0081 IS A THIN SHABBY LOOKING BIRD

277-127368-0083 WITH A KIND OF SNEEZE IN THE MIDDLE HOWEVER YOU'LL HEAR IT DONE MAYBE DOWN IN THE WOOD YONDER AND WHEN YOU'VE ONCE HEARD IT YOU'LL BE QUITE CONTENT
277-127368-0084 ALL THAT HARD STUFF TO YOU I READ IT IN A BOOK SAID ALICE BUT I HAD SOME POETRY REPEATED TO ME MUCH EASIER THAN THAT
277-127368-0085 I THINK IT WAS
277-127368-0086 SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY STRETCHING OUT ONE OF HIS GREAT HANDS
277-127368-0087 IF IT COMES TO THAT OH IT NEEDN'T COME TO THAT ALICE HASTILY SAID HOPING TO KEEP HIM FROM BEGINNING THE PIECE I'M GOING TO REPEAT
277-127368-0088 HE WENT ON WITHOUT NOTICING HER REMARK WAS WRITTEN ENTIRELY FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT
277-127368-0089 SO SHE SAT DOWN AND SAID
277-127368-0090 IN WINTER WHEN THE FIELDS ARE WHITE I SING THIS SONG FOR YOUR DELIGHT ONLY I DON'T SING IT HE ADDED AS AN EXPLANATION
277-127368-0091 I SEE YOU DON'T SAID ALICE
277-127368-0092 HUMPTY DUMPTY REMARKED SEVERELY ALICE WAS SILENT IN SPRING WHEN WOODS ARE GETTING GREEN
277-127368-0093 IN SUMMER WHEN THE DAYS ARE LONG PERHAPS YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE SONG IN AUTUMN WHEN THE LEAVES ARE BROWN TAKE PEN AND INK
277-127368-0094 AND WRITE IT DOWN I WILL IF I CAN REMEMBER IT SO LONG
277-127368-0095 AND THEY PUT ME OUT I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE FISH I TOLD THEM
277-127368-0096 THE LITTLE FISHES OF THE SEA THEY SENT AN ANSWER BACK TO ME
277-127368-0097 I'M AFRAID I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID ALICE IT GETS EASIER FURTHER ON HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED I SENT TO THEM AGAIN TO SAY
277-127368-0098 THE FISHES ANSWERED
277-127368-0099 IN I TOLD THEM ONCE I TOLD THEM TWICE THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ADVICE I TOOK A KETTLE LARGE AND NEW
277-127368-0100 FIT FOR THE DEED I HAD TO DO MY HEART WENT HOP MY HEART WENT THUMP I FILLED THE KETTLE AT THE PUMP THEN SOME ONE CAME TO ME AND SAID
277-127368-0101 THE LITTLE FISHES ARE IN BED I SAID TO HIM I SAID IT PLAIN THEN YOU MUST WAKE THEM UP AGAIN I SAID IT VERY LOUD AND CLEAR
277-127368-0102 I WENT AND SHOUTED IN HIS EAR HUMPTY DUMPTY RAISED HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A SCREAM
277-127368-0103 AND ALICE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE MESSENGER FOR ANYTHING BUT HE WAS VERY STIFF AND PROUD HE SAID YOU NEEDN'T SHOUT SO LOUD
277-127368-0104 HE SAID I'D GO AND WAKE THEM IF I TOOK A CORKSCREW FROM THE SHELF I WENT TO WAKE THEM UP MYSELF AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED I PULLED AND PUSHED
277-127368-0105 AND KICKED AND KNOCKED AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS SHUT I TRIED TO TURN THE HANDLE BUT THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE IS THAT ALL ALICE TIMIDLY ASKED
277-127368-0106 THAT'S ALL SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY GOOD BYE THIS WAS RATHER SUDDEN ALICE THOUGHT BUT AFTER SUCH A VERY STRONG HINT THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE GOING
277-127368-0107 SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD HARDLY BE CIVIL TO STAY SO SHE GOT UP AND HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD BYE
277-127368-0108 SHE SAID AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD I SHOULDN'T KNOW YOU AGAIN IF WE DID MEET HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED IN A DISCONTENTED TONE GIVING HER ONE OF HIS FINGERS TO SHAKE
277-127368-0109 YOU'RE SO EXACTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THE FACE IS WHAT ONE GOES BY GENERALLY ALICE REMARKED IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE THAT'S JUST WHAT I COMPLAIN OF
277-127368-0110 MOUTH UNDER IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME NOW IF YOU HAD THE TWO EYES ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE NOSE FOR INSTANCE OR THE MOUTH AT THE TOP THAT
277-127368-0111 BUT HUMPTY DUMPTY ONLY SHUT HIS EYES AND SAID WAIT TILL YOU'VE TRIED ALICE WAITED A MINUTE TO SEE IF HE WOULD SPEAK AGAIN
277-127368-0112 SHE SAID GOOD BYE ONCE MORE AND GETTING NO ANSWER TO THIS SHE QUIETLY WALKED AWAY BUT SHE COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO HERSELF AS SHE WENT
277-127368-0113 OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY SHE REPEATED THIS ALOUD AS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE SUCH A LONG WORD TO SAY OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY PEOPLE
277-127368-0114 SHE NEVER FINISHED THE SENTENCE FOR AT THIS MOMENT
