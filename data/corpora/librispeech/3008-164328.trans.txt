3008-164328-0000 WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT RED MEAT NOW THE DONJON INN WAS OF NO IMPOSING APPEARANCE BUT I LIKE THESE BUILDINGS WITH THEIR RAFTERS BLACKENED WITH AGE AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR HEARTHS THESE INNS OF THE COACHING DAYS CRUMBLING ERECTIONS THAT WILL SOON EXIST IN THE MEMORY ONLY
3008-164328-0001 THEY BELONG TO THE BYGONE DAYS THEY ARE LINKED WITH HISTORY THEY MAKE US THINK OF THE ROAD OF THOSE DAYS WHEN HIGHWAYMEN RODE I SAW AT ONCE THAT THE DONJON INN WAS AT LEAST TWO CENTURIES OLD PERHAPS OLDER
3008-164328-0002 UNDER ITS SIGN BOARD OVER THE THRESHOLD A MAN WITH A CRABBED LOOKING FACE WAS STANDING SEEMINGLY PLUNGED IN UNPLEASANT THOUGHT IF THE WRINKLES ON HIS FOREHEAD AND THE KNITTING OF HIS BROWS WERE ANY INDICATION
3008-164328-0003 AS WE EXPRESSED A HOPE THAT HE WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO FURNISH US WITH A BREAKFAST HE ASSURED US THAT HE HAD NO PROVISIONS REGARDING US AS HE SAID THIS WITH A LOOK THAT WAS UNMISTAKABLY SUSPICIOUS
3008-164328-0004 WE ARE NOT POLICEMEN I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE POLICE I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYONE REPLIED THE MAN I HAD MADE MY FRIEND UNDERSTAND BY A SIGN THAT WE SHOULD DO BETTER NOT TO INSIST BUT BEING DETERMINED TO ENTER THE INN
3008-164328-0005 HE SLIPPED BY THE MAN ON THE DOORSTEP AND WAS IN THE COMMON ROOM COME ON HE SAID IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE HERE A GOOD FIRE WAS BLAZING IN THE CHIMNEY AND WE HELD OUR HANDS TO THE WARMTH IT SENT OUT
3008-164328-0006 IT WAS A MORNING IN WHICH THE APPROACH OF WINTER WAS UNMISTAKABLE THE ROOM WAS A TOLERABLY LARGE ONE FURNISHED WITH TWO HEAVY TABLES SOME STOOLS A COUNTER DECORATED WITH ROWS OF BOTTLES OF SYRUP AND ALCOHOL
3008-164328-0007 THREE WINDOWS LOOKED OUT ON TO THE ROAD A COLOURED ADVERTISEMENT LAUDED THE MANY MERITS OF A NEW VERMOUTH ON THE MANTELPIECE WAS ARRAYED THE INNKEEPER'S COLLECTION OF FIGURED EARTHENWARE POTS AND STONE JUGS
3008-164328-0008 THAT'S A FINE FIRE FOR ROASTING A CHICKEN SAID ROULETABILLE WE HAVE NO CHICKEN NOT EVEN A WRETCHED RABBIT SAID THE LANDLORD I KNOW SAID MY FRIEND SLOWLY I KNOW
3008-164328-0009 WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT RED MEAT NOW I CONFESS I DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT ROULETABILLE MEANT BY WHAT HE HAD SAID BUT THE LANDLORD AS SOON AS HE HEARD THE WORDS UTTERED AN OATH
3008-164328-0010 WHICH HE AT ONCE STIFLED AND PLACED HIMSELF AT OUR ORDERS AS OBEDIENTLY AS MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC HAD DONE
3008-164328-0011 THE PRESBYTERY HAS LOST NOTHING OF ITS CHARM NOR THE GARDEN ITS BRIGHTNESS CERTAINLY MY FRIEND KNEW HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HIM BY THE USE OF WHOLLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE PHRASES I OBSERVED AS MUCH TO HIM
3008-164328-0012 BUT HE MERELY SMILED I SHOULD HAVE PROPOSED THAT HE GIVE ME SOME EXPLANATION BUT HE PUT A FINGER TO HIS LIPS WHICH EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED THAT HE HAD NOT ONLY DETERMINED NOT TO SPEAK BUT ALSO ENJOINED SILENCE ON MY PART
3008-164328-0013 MEANTIME THE MAN HAD PUSHED OPEN A LITTLE SIDE DOOR AND CALLED TO SOMEBODY TO BRING HIM HALF A DOZEN EGGS AND A PIECE OF BEEFSTEAK THE COMMISSION WAS QUICKLY EXECUTED BY A STRONGLY BUILT YOUNG WOMAN WITH BEAUTIFUL BLONDE HAIR AND LARGE HANDSOME EYES
3008-164328-0014 WHO REGARDED US WITH CURIOSITY THE INNKEEPER SAID TO HER ROUGHLY GET OUT AND IF THE GREEN MAN COMES DON'T LET ME SEE HIM SHE DISAPPEARED
3008-164328-0015 AND THE MEAT WHICH WAS ON A DISH PLACED ALL CAREFULLY BESIDE HIM IN THE CHIMNEY UNHOOKED A FRYING PAN AND A GRIDIRON AND BEGAN TO BEAT UP OUR OMELETTE BEFORE PROCEEDING TO GRILL OUR BEEFSTEAK HE THEN ORDERED TWO BOTTLES OF CIDER
3008-164328-0016 AND SEEMED TO TAKE AS LITTLE NOTICE OF OUR HOST AS OUR HOST DID OF HIM THE LANDLORD LET US DO OUR OWN COOKING AND SET OUR TABLE NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS SUDDENLY I HEARD HIM MUTTER AH THERE HE IS
3008-164328-0017 HIS FACE HAD CHANGED EXPRESSING FIERCE HATRED HE WENT AND GLUED HIMSELF TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS WATCHING THE ROAD
3008-164328-0018 HE HAD ALREADY LEFT OUR OMELETTE AND HAD JOINED THE LANDLORD AT THE WINDOW I WENT WITH HIM A MAN DRESSED ENTIRELY IN GREEN VELVET HIS HEAD COVERED WITH A HUNTSMAN'S CAP OF THE SAME COLOUR WAS ADVANCING LEISURELY LIGHTING A PIPE AS HE WALKED
3008-164328-0019 HE CARRIED A FOWLING PIECE SLUNG AT HIS BACK HIS MOVEMENTS DISPLAYED AN ALMOST ARISTOCRATIC EASE HE WORE EYE GLASSES AND APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FIVE AND FORTY YEARS OF AGE HIS HAIR AS WELL AS HIS MOUSTACHE WERE SALT GREY
3008-164328-0020 HE WAS REMARKABLY HANDSOME AS HE PASSED NEAR THE INN HE HESITATED AS IF ASKING HIMSELF WHETHER OR NO HE SHOULD ENTER IT GAVE A GLANCE TOWARDS US TOOK A FEW WHIFFS AT HIS PIPE AND THEN RESUMED HIS WALK AT THE SAME NONCHALANT PACE
3008-164328-0021 THE GREEN MAN GROWLED THE INNKEEPER DON'T YOU KNOW HIM THEN ALL THE BETTER FOR YOU HE IS NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE TO MAKE WELL HE IS MONSIEUR STANGERSON'S FOREST KEEPER
3008-164328-0022 ASKED THE REPORTER POURING HIS OMELETTE INTO THE FRYING PAN NOBODY LIKES HIM MONSIEUR HE'S AN UPSTART WHO MUST ONCE HAVE HAD A FORTUNE OF HIS OWN AND HE FORGIVES NOBODY BECAUSE IN ORDER TO LIVE HE HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO BECOME A SERVANT
3008-164328-0023 A KEEPER IS AS MUCH A SERVANT AS ANY OTHER ISN'T HE UPON MY WORD
3008-164328-0024 AND THAT ALL THE LAND AND WOODS BELONG TO HIM HE'LL NOT LET A POOR CREATURE EAT A MORSEL OF BREAD ON THE GRASS HIS GRASS DOES HE OFTEN COME HERE TOO OFTEN BUT I'VE MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT HIS FACE DOESN'T PLEASE ME
3008-164328-0025 AND FOR A MONTH PAST HE HASN'T BEEN HERE THE DONJON INN HAS NEVER EXISTED FOR HIM HE HASN'T HAD TIME
3008-164328-0026 WHY THE CONCIERGES OF THE CHATEAU WOULD TURN THEIR EYES AWAY FROM A PICTURE OF HIM THE CONCIERGES OF THE CHATEAU ARE HONEST PEOPLE THEN YES THEY ARE AS TRUE AS MY NAME'S MATHIEU MONSIEUR I BELIEVE THEM TO BE HONEST YET THEY'VE BEEN ARRESTED WHAT DOES THAT PROVE
3008-164328-0027 AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE MURDER OF THE MURDER OF POOR MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON A GOOD GIRL MUCH LOVED EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF IT AND MANY THINGS BESIDES BUT THAT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS NOT EVEN MINE
3008-164328-0028 THE INNKEEPER LOOKED AT HIM SIDEWAYS AND SAID GRUFFLY NOT EVEN YOURS THE OMELETTE READY WE SAT DOWN AT TABLE AND WERE SILENTLY EATING WHEN THE DOOR WAS PUSHED OPEN AND AN OLD WOMAN DRESSED IN RAGS LEANING ON A STICK
3008-164328-0029 HER HEAD DODDERING HER WHITE HAIR HANGING LOOSELY OVER HER WRINKLED FOREHEAD APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD AH THERE YOU ARE MOTHER ANGENOUX IT'S LONG SINCE WE SAW YOU LAST SAID OUR HOST
3008-164328-0030 VERY ILL VERY NEARLY DYING SAID THE OLD WOMAN
3008-164328-0031 AND SHE ENTERED FOLLOWED BY A CAT LARGER THAN ANY I HAD EVER BELIEVED COULD EXIST THE BEAST LOOKED AT US
3008-164328-0032 I HAD NEVER HEARD SO LUGUBRIOUS A CRY AS IF DRAWN BY THE CAT'S CRY A MAN FOLLOWED THE OLD WOMAN IN IT WAS THE GREEN MAN HE SALUTED BY RAISING HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND SEATED HIMSELF AT A TABLE NEAR TO OURS
3008-164328-0033 A GLASS OF CIDER DADDY MATHIEU HE SAID AS THE GREEN MAN ENTERED DADDY MATHIEU HAD STARTED VIOLENTLY BUT VISIBLY MASTERING HIMSELF HE SAID I'VE NO MORE CIDER I SERVED THE LAST BOTTLES TO THESE GENTLEMEN
3008-164328-0034 THEN GIVE ME A GLASS OF WHITE WINE SAID THE GREEN MAN WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST SURPRISE I'VE NO MORE WHITE WINE NO MORE ANYTHING SAID DADDY MATHIEU SURLILY HOW IS MADAME MATHIEU QUITE WELL THANK YOU
3008-164328-0035 SO THE YOUNG WOMAN WITH THE LARGE TENDER EYES WHOM WE HAD JUST SEEN WAS THE WIFE OF THIS REPUGNANT AND BRUTAL RUSTIC WHOSE JEALOUSY SEEMED TO EMPHASISE HIS PHYSICAL UGLINESS SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM THE INNKEEPER LEFT THE ROOM
3008-164328-0036 THE CAT AT HER FEET YOU'VE BEEN ILL MOTHER ANGENOUX IS THAT WHY WE HAVE NOT SEEN YOU FOR THE LAST WEEK ASKED THE GREEN MAN
3008-164328-0037 I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET UP BUT THREE TIMES
3008-164328-0038 OUR GOOD PATRONESS AND THE REST OF THE TIME I HAVE BEEN LYING ON MY BED THERE WAS NO ONE TO CARE FOR ME BUT THE BETE DU BON DIEU DID SHE NOT LEAVE YOU NEITHER BY DAY NOR BY NIGHT
3008-164328-0039 ARE YOU SURE OF THAT AS I AM OF PARADISE THEN HOW WAS IT MADAME ANGENOUX THAT ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER NOTHING BUT THE CRY OF THE BETE DU BON DIEU WAS HEARD
3008-164328-0040 I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID BUT SHALL I TELL YOU SOMETHING THERE ARE NO TWO CATS IN THE WORLD THAT CRY LIKE THAT WELL ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER I ALSO HEARD THE CRY OF THE BETE DU BON DIEU OUTSIDE
3008-164328-0041 AND YET SHE WAS ON MY KNEES AND DID NOT MEW ONCE I SWEAR I CROSSED MYSELF WHEN I HEARD THAT AS IF I HAD HEARD THE DEVIL I LOOKED AT THE KEEPER WHEN HE PUT THE LAST QUESTION
3008-164328-0042 AND I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF I DID NOT DETECT AN EVIL SMILE ON HIS LIPS AT THAT MOMENT THE NOISE OF LOUD QUARRELLING REACHED US WE EVEN THOUGHT WE HEARD A DULL SOUND OF BLOWS AS IF SOME ONE WAS BEING BEATEN
3008-164328-0043 THE GREEN MAN QUICKLY ROSE AND HURRIED TO THE DOOR BY THE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE BUT IT WAS OPENED BY THE LANDLORD WHO APPEARED AND SAID TO THE KEEPER DON'T ALARM YOURSELF MONSIEUR IT IS MY WIFE SHE HAS THE TOOTHACHE AND HE LAUGHED
3008-164328-0044 HE HELD OUT A PACKET TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO TOOK IT EAGERLY AND WENT OUT BY THE DOOR CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY HER CAT THEN YOU WON'T SERVE ME ASKED THE GREEN MAN DADDY MATHIEU'S FACE WAS PLACID AND NO LONGER RETAINED ITS EXPRESSION OF HATRED
3008-164328-0045 I'VE NOTHING FOR YOU NOTHING FOR YOU TAKE YOURSELF OFF THE GREEN MAN QUIETLY REFILLED HIS PIPE LIT IT BOWED TO US AND WENT OUT
3008-164328-0046 NO SOONER WAS HE OVER THE THRESHOLD THAN DADDY MATHIEU SLAMMED THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND TURNING TOWARDS US WITH EYES BLOODSHOT AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH HE HISSED TO US SHAKING HIS CLENCHED FIST AT THE DOOR HE HAD JUST SHUT ON THE MAN HE EVIDENTLY HATED
3008-164328-0047 I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE WHO TELL ME WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT RED MEAT NOW BUT IF IT WILL INTEREST YOU TO KNOW IT THAT MAN IS THE MURDERER WITH WHICH WORDS DADDY MATHIEU IMMEDIATELY LEFT US
3008-164328-0048 ROULETABILLE RETURNED TOWARDS THE FIREPLACE AND SAID NOW WE'LL GRILL OUR STEAK
3008-164328-0049 WE SAW NO MORE OF DADDY MATHIEU THAT DAY AND ABSOLUTE SILENCE REIGNED IN THE INN WHEN WE LEFT IT AFTER PLACING FIVE FRANCS ON THE TABLE IN PAYMENT FOR OUR FEAST
3008-164328-0050 ROULETABILLE AT ONCE SET OFF ON A THREE MILE WALK ROUND PROFESSOR STANGERSON'S ESTATE HE HALTED FOR SOME TEN MINUTES AT THE CORNER OF A NARROW ROAD BLACK WITH SOOT
3008-164328-0051 WHICH TOUCHES ON THE ROAD FROM EPINAY TO CORBEIL TO TELL ME THAT THE MURDERER HAD CERTAINLY PASSED THAT WAY BEFORE ENTERING THE GROUNDS AND CONCEALING HIMSELF IN THE LITTLE CLUMP OF TREES YOU DON'T THINK THEN THAT THE KEEPER KNOWS ANYTHING OF IT I ASKED
3008-164328-0052 WE SHALL SEE THAT LATER HE REPLIED FOR THE PRESENT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT THE LANDLORD SAID ABOUT THE MAN THE LANDLORD HATES HIM I DIDN'T TAKE YOU TO BREAKFAST AT THE DONJON INN FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREEN MAN
3008-164328-0053 FOLLOWED BY ME TOWARDS THE LITTLE BUILDING WHICH STANDING NEAR THE PARK GATE
3008-164328-0054 WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED THAT MORNING WITH THE SKILL OF AN ACROBAT HE GOT INTO THE LODGE BY AN UPPER WINDOW WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN AND RETURNED TEN MINUTES LATER HE SAID ONLY AH A WORD WHICH IN HIS MOUTH
3008-164328-0055 SIGNIFIED MANY THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE THE ROAD LEADING TO THE CHATEAU WHEN A CONSIDERABLE STIR AT THE PARK GATE ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION
3008-164328-0056 AND WHETHER HE IS SO MUCH CLEVERER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
3008-164328-0057 WHO WERE ALSO DESIROUS OF ENTERING THE PARK BUT TWO GENDARMES STATIONED AT THE GATE HAD EVIDENTLY RECEIVED ORDERS TO REFUSE ADMISSION TO ANYBODY
