5765-231844-0000 SEEMED TO CONTRADICT THE FACT AND HE COULD BY NO MEANS RECONCILE HER ABSENCE WITH THE PRESENCE ON THE FENCE OF THE FRAGMENT OF GAUZE STILL LESS WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT SHE MUST HAVE CLIMBED OVER A TOLERABLY DIFFICULT OBSTACLE TO ENTER THE YARD LET ALONE THE NECESSITY BY NO MEANS EASY TO A WOMAN
5765-231844-0001 OF DESCENDING INTO THE DISUSED CELLAR BY MEANS OF A SHAKY AND FRAGILE LADDER AFTER ALL THOUGHT LUCIAN WHEN HE WAS SEATED THAT SAME EVENING AT HIS DINNER
5765-231844-0002 I AM NO MORE CERTAIN THAT THE VEIL IS THE PROPERTY OF MISSUS VRAIN THAN I AM THAT SHE WAS THE WOMAN WHOSE SHADOW I SAW ON THE BLIND WHOSOEVER IT WAS THAT GAINED ENTRANCE BY PASSING OVER FENCE AND THROUGH CELLAR MUST HAVE COME ACROSS THE YARD BELONGING TO THE HOUSE FACING THE OTHER ROAD

5765-231844-0036 SLIPPING THE DRAWING OF THE PLAN INTO HIS BREAST COAT POCKET
5765-231844-0037 OF COURSE YOU'LL REPEAT OUR CONVERSATION TO NO ONE I SWEAR TO BREATHE NO WORD SAID MISS GREEB DRAMATICALLY AND LEFT THE ROOM GREATLY PLEASED WITH THIS SECRET UNDERSTANDING
5765-231844-0038 WHICH HAD QUITE THE AIR OF AN INNOCENT INTRIGUE SUCH AS WAS DETAILED IN JOURNALS DESIGNED FOR THE USE OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO LUCIAN MUSED OVER THE INFORMATION HE HAD OBTAINED AND MADE A FRESH DRAWING OF THE PLAN FOR HIS OWN SATISFACTION
5765-231844-0039 BUT HE TOOK NO STEPS ON THIS NEW EVIDENCE AS HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SUBMIT HIS DISCOVERIES TO MISS VRAIN BEFORE DOING SO AT THE PRESENT TIME DIANA WAS AT BATH TAKING POSSESSION OF HER ANCESTRAL ACRES AND CONSULTING THE FAMILY LAWYER ON VARIOUS MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE PROPERTY
5765-231844-0040 ONCE SHE WROTE TO LUCIAN ADVISING HIM THAT SHE HAD HEARD SEVERAL PIECES OF NEWS LIKELY TO BE USEFUL IN CLEARING UP THE MYSTERY BUT THESE SHE REFUSED TO COMMUNICATE SAVE AT A PERSONAL INTERVIEW DENZIL WAS THUS KEPT IN SUSPENSE
5765-231844-0041 AND UNABLE TO REST UNTIL HE KNEW PRECISELY THE VALUE OF MISS VRAIN'S NEWLY ACQUIRED INFORMATION THEREFORE IT WAS WITH A FEELING OF RELIEF THAT HE RECEIVED A NOTE FROM HER ASKING HIM TO CALL AT THREE O'CLOCK ON SUNDAY AT THE ROYAL JOHN HOTEL SINCE HER GOING AND COMING
5765-231844-0042 A WEEK HAD ELAPSED NOW THAT HIS DIVINITY HAD RETURNED AND HE WAS ABOUT TO SEE HER AGAIN THE SUN SHONE ONCE MORE IN THE HEAVENS FOR LUCIAN AND HE ARRAYED HIMSELF FOR HIS VISIT WITH THE UTMOST CARE
5765-231844-0043 AND HE THOUGHT LESS OF THE CASE AT THE MOMENT THAN OF THE JOY IN SEEING MISS VRAIN ONCE MORE IN HEARING HER SPEAK AND WATCHING HER LOVELY FACE ON HER PART DIANA RECOLLECTING THEIR LAST MEETING OR MORE PARTICULARLY THEIR PARTING BLUSHED IN HER TURN
5765-231844-0044 AND GAVE HER HAND TO THE BARRISTER WITH A NEW BORN TIMIDITY SHE ALSO WAS INCLINED TO LIKE LUCIAN MORE THAN WAS REASONABLE FOR THE PEACE OF HER HEART SO THESE TWO PEOPLE EACH DRAWN TO THE OTHER SHOULD HAVE COME TOGETHER AS LOVERS EVEN AT THIS SECOND MEETING BUT ALAS
5765-231844-0045 FOR THE PROSAICNESS OF THIS WORKADAY WORLD THEY HAD TO ASSUME THE ATTITUDES OF LAWYER AND CLIENT AND DISCOURSE OF CRIME INSTEAD OF LOVE THE SITUATION WAS A TRIFLE IRONICAL AND MUST HAVE PROVOKED THE LAUGHTER OF THE GODS WELL ASKED MISS VRAIN
