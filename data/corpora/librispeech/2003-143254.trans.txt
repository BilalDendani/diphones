2003-143254-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO HOW HIGH THE WATER CAME THE COMING OF THE STORM CHECKED THE FURIOUS ONSLAUGHT OF OUR BLACK ENEMIES BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR THE MOMENT SETTING THUNDER LIGHTNING
2003-143254-0001 AND THE DELUGING RAIN AT DEFIANCE THEY CAME RUSHING ON SHOUTING AND YELLING FURIOUSLY AND WE WERE ABOUT TO DRAW TRIGGER RELUCTANTLY ENOUGH BUT IN SHEER DESPERATION WHEN A VOLLEY OF ARROWS CHECKED THEM FOR A TIME
2003-143254-0002 WHILE RESUMING WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FAVOURITE MEANS OF WARRING UPON HIS ENEMIES JIMMY COMMENCED HURLING MASSES OF STONE AT THE COMING FOES CHECKED AS THEY WERE THOUGH IT WAS ONLY FOR A
2003-143254-0003 WITH FRESH ASSAILANTS TAKING THE PLACES OF THOSE WHO FELL THE THUNDER PEALED SO THAT THE REPORTS OF OUR PIECES SEEMED FEEBLE MORE LIKE THE CRACK OF A CART WHIP AND THEIR FLASHES WERE AS SPARKS COMPARED WITH THE BLINDING LIGHTNING
2003-143254-0004 WHICH DARTED AND QUIVERED IN THE GORGE AT TIMES SEEMING TO LICK THE WALLS AT OTHERS PLUNGING INTO THE RUSHING SEETHING STREAM INTO WHICH THE RAIN POURED IN VERY CATARACTS DOWN THE ROCKY SIDES
2003-143254-0005 WE SHOULD HAVE CEASED IN VERY AWE OF THE TERRIBLE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS BUT IN SELF DEFENCE WE WERE DRIVEN TO FIGHT HARD AND REPEL THE CONTINUED ATTACKS OF THE ENEMY WHO
2003-143254-0006 GROWING MORE ENRAGED AT OUR RESISTANCE CAME ON ONCE MORE IN A DETERMINED FASHION AS IF MEANING THIS TIME TO SWEEP US BEFORE THEM INTO THE RUSHING STREAM
2003-143254-0007 BUT FOR THE BRAVERY OF OUR BLACK COMPANIONS OUR EFFORTS WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BACK BY THE FIERCE SAVAGES WHO ADVANCED UP THE PATH SPRANG UPON THE STONE BREASTWORK
2003-143254-0008 AND USED THEIR WAR CLUBS IN THE MOST GALLANT MANNER JIMMY TOO SEEMED TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO AS BRAVE A BLACK WARRIOR AS EVER FOUGHT AND IT WAS THE GALLANT RESISTANCE OFFERED
2003-143254-0009 THAT CHECKED THE ENEMY AND MADE THEM RECOIL THE FALLING BACK OF THE FOREMOST MEN WHO WERE BEATEN AND STUNNED BY THE BLOWS THEY HAD RECEIVED DROVE THEIR COMPANIONS TO MAKE A TEMPORARY RETREAT AND ENABLED US TO RELOAD
2003-143254-0010 BUT ERE WE COULD SEEM TO GET BREATH ONE WHO APPEARED TO BE A CHIEF RALLIED THEM AND TWO ABREAST ALL THAT THE PATH WOULD ALLOW THEY CAME CHARGING UP TOWARDS US ONCE AGAIN
2003-143254-0011 THEN THERE WAS A DEAD PAUSE AS THE THUNDER CRASHED OVERHEAD ONCE MORE AND THEN SEEMED TO BE CONTINUED IN A STRANGE RUSHING SOUND WHICH APPARENTLY PARALYSED THE ATTACKING PARTY WHO HESITATED
2003-143254-0012 STOPPED SHORT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY UP THE NARROW SLOPE THAT LED TO OUR LITTLE FORT AND THEN WITH A SHRIEK OF DISMAY TURNED AND BEGAN TO RETREAT I STARED AFTER THEM
2003-143254-0013 THAT THEY SHOULD GIVE WAY JUST AT A TIME WHEN A BOLD ATTACK WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ENDED IN OUR DESTRUCTION BUT I COULD MAKE OUT NOTHING
2003-143254-0014 ONLY THAT THE NOISE OF THE THUNDER STILL SEEMED TO CONTINUE AND GROW INTO A SOUND LIKE A FIERCE RUSH BUT THIS WAS NOTHING NEW THE THUNDER HAD BEEN GOING ON BEFORE AND THAT
2003-143254-0015 AND THE BLINDING LIGHTNING THE ENEMY HAD BRAVED OUR DEFENCE HAD HAD NO EFFECT UPON THEM SAVE TO MAKE THEM ATTACK MORE FIERCELY AND YET THEY WERE NOW IN FULL RETREAT
2003-143254-0016 FALLING OVER EACH OTHER IN THEIR HASTE AND WE SAW TWO THRUST INTO THE SWIFT RIVER
2003-143254-0017 CLAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER AND TURNING SHARPLY I SAW THE MEANING OF THE PROLONGATION OF THE THUNDER FOR A GREAT WAVE AT LEAST TEN FEET HIGH RUDDY FOAMING AND FULL OF TOSSING BRANCHES CAME RUSHING DOWN THE GORGE
2003-143254-0018 AS IF IN CHASE OF OUR ENEMIES AND BEFORE I HAD MORE THAN TIME TO REALISE THE DANGER
2003-143254-0019 TO OUR PLACE OF REFUGE AND WHERE A MINUTE BEFORE THERE HAD BEEN A ROCKY SHELF THE PATH ALONG WHICH WE HAD COME
2003-143254-0020 I TURNED AGHAST TO THE DOCTOR AND THEN MADE AS IF TO RUN EXPECTING THAT THE NEXT MOMENT WE SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY BUT HE CAUGHT ME BY THE ARM WITH A GRIP LIKE IRON STAND STILL HE ROARED
2003-143254-0021 WITH HIS LIPS TO MY EAR THE STORM HIGH UP THE MOUNTAINS FLOOD THE GORGE JUST THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER CRASHING PEAL OF THUNDER CLOSE UPON A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND THE HISSING RAIN CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC
2003-143254-0022 THE DULL BOOM OF THE TREMENDOUS WAVE HAD PASSED TOO BUT THE RIVER HISSED AND ROARED AS IT TORE ALONG BENEATH OUR FEET AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT IT WAS RISING HIGHER STILL
2003-143254-0023 THE NOISE WAS NOT SO GREAT THOUGH NOW THAT WE COULD NOT TALK AND AFTER RECOVERING FROM THE APPALLING SHOCK OF THE NEW DANGER WE HAD TIME TO LOOK AROUND OUR FIRST THOUGHT WAS
2003-143254-0024 OF OUR ENEMIES AND WE GAZED EXCITEDLY DOWN THE GORGE AND THEN AT EACH OTHER JACK PENNY SHUDDERING AND TURNING AWAY HIS HEAD
2003-143254-0025 AS I FULLY REALISED THE FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SWEPT AWAY THERE COULD NOT BE A MOMENT'S DOUBT OF THAT
2003-143254-0026 AND DASHED ALONG AT FRIGHTFUL SPEED WE HAD ONLY ESCAPED A SIMILAR FATE THROUGH BEING ON THE SUMMIT SO TO SPEAK OF THE ROCKY PATH
2003-143254-0027 WE COULD NOT TELL FOR HOW LONG WHILE ON TAKING A HASTY GLANCE AT OUR POSITION IT WAS THIS OVERHEAD THE SHELVING ROCK QUITE IMPASSABLE
2003-143254-0028 TO LEFT TO RIGHT AND IN FRONT THE SWOLLEN RUSHING TORRENT THE DOCTOR STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE WATER FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN TURNED TO ME HOW HIGH ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WERE WE DO YOU THINK WHEN WE CAME HERE
2003-143254-0029 I SHOULD SAY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET WHY WE AIN'T FOUR FOOT ABOVE IT NOW AND LOOK THERE
2003-143254-0030 I SAY JOE CARSTAIRS IF I'D KNOWN WE WERE GOING TO BE DROWNED I WOULDN'T HAVE COME ARE YOU SURE IT IS RISING SAID THE DOCTOR BENDING DOWN TO EXAMINE THE LEVEL AN EXAMPLE I FOLLOWED
2003-143254-0031 TO SEE CRACK AND CREVICE GRADUALLY FILL AND POINT AFTER POINT COVERED BY THE SEETHING WATER WHICH CREPT UP SLOWLY AND INSIDIOUSLY HIGHER AND HIGHER EVEN AS WE WATCHED YES SAID THE DOCTOR
2003-143254-0032 RISING TO HIS FEET AND GAZING CALMLY ROUND AS IF TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY LOOPHOLE LEFT FOR ESCAPE YES THE WATER IS RISING FAST THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THAT JUST THEN GYP
2003-143254-0033 WHO HAD BEEN FIERCE AND ANGRY SNAPPING AND BARKING FURIOUSLY AT THE SAVAGES EACH TIME THEY CHARGED SUDDENLY THREW UP HIS HEAD AND UTTERED A DISMAL HOWL HERE YOU HOLD YOUR NOISE CRIED JACK PENNY
2003-143254-0034 YOU DON'T HEAR US HOLLER DO YOU LIE DOWN THE DOG HOWLED SOFTLY AND CROUCHED AT HIS MASTER'S FEET WHILE JACK BEGAN TO TAKE OFF HIS CLOTHES IN A VERY SLOW AND LEISURELY WAY
2003-143254-0035 FIRST HE PULLED OFF HIS BOOTS THEN HIS STOCKINGS WHICH HE TUCKED METHODICALLY ALONG WITH HIS GARTERS INSIDE HIS BOOTS THIS DONE HE TOOK OFF HIS JACKET FOLDED IT CAREFULLY AND HIS SHIRT FOLLOWED
2003-143254-0036 TO BE SMOOTHED AND FOLDED AND LAID UPON THE JACKET AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I THOROUGHLY REALISED HOW EXCESSIVELY THIN POOR JACK PENNY WAS AND THE REASON WHY
2003-143254-0037 IT SEEMED A STRANGE TIME AFTER PASSING THROUGH SUCH A SERIES OF DANGERS AFTER ESCAPING BY SO LITTLE FROM BEING SWEPT AWAY AND WHILE IN TERRIBLE DANGER FROM THE SWIFTLY RISING WATERS
2003-143254-0038 BUT I COULD NOT HELP IT JACK'S ASPECT AS HE SAT THERE COOLLY VERY COOLLY CLOTHED IN HIS TROUSERS ALONE WAS SO LUDICROUS THAT I BURST OUT LAUGHING WHEN JIMMY JOINED IN AND BEGAN TO DANCE WITH DELIGHT
2003-143254-0039 DO HE SAID WHY SWIM FOR IT YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I'M GOING TO TRY IN MY CLOTHES MY MIRTH DIED OUT AS SWIFTLY AS IT CAME FOR THE DOCTOR LAID HIS HAND UPON MY ARM
2003-143254-0040 AND PRESSED IT SILENTLY TO CALL MY ATTENTION TO OUR BLACK FOLLOWERS WHO WERE LAYING THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS REGULARLY IN COMPANY WITH THEIR WADDIES EACH MAN LOOKING VERY STERN AND GRAVE
2003-143254-0041 THEY SHOWED NO FEAR THEY RAISED NO WILD CRY THEY ONLY SEEMED TO BE PREPARING FOR WHAT WAS INEVITABLE
2003-143254-0042 AND THEN RISE UP AND LOOK ROUND AT HIS COMPANIONS SAYING A FEW WORDS IN THEIR TONGUE THE CHILL OF HORROR CAME BACK ONCE MORE
