3989-182394-0000 BUT NO JERRY MUSKRAT PROBABLY HE IS TAKING A NAP IN THAT BIG HOUSE OF HIS SAID JOHNNY CHUCK AND IF HE IS WE'LL HAVE TO SIT HERE UNTIL HE WAKES UP OR ELSE GO BACK HOME AND VISIT HIM SOME OTHER TIME
3989-182394-0001 THAT'S SO REPLIED PETER I DON'T SEE WHAT HE HAS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER FOR ANYWAY
3989-182394-0002 FUNNY PLACE TO BUILD A HOUSE ISN'T IT JOHNNY CHUCK SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY IT DOES SEEM A FUNNY PLACE HE ADMITTED IT CERTAINLY DOES SEEM A FUNNY PLACE BUT THEN JERRY MUSKRAT IS A FUNNY FELLOW
3989-182394-0003 THAT SEEMS FUNNY TO ME I SUPPOSE THERE IS A REASON FOR IT AND PROBABLY THERE IS A REASON FOR BUILDING HIS HOUSE WHERE IT IS I'VE FOUND THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR MOST THINGS PROBABLY JERRY'S GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER BUILT HIS HOUSE THAT WAY AND SO JERRY DOES THE SAME THING
3989-182394-0004 PETER RABBIT SUDDENLY BRIGHTENED UP I DO BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT JOHNNY CHUCK AND IF YOU ARE THERE MUST BE A STORY ABOUT IT AND IF THERE IS A STORY GRANDFATHER FROG WILL BE SURE TO KNOW IT THERE HE IS OVER ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD
3989-182394-0005 AND HE LOOKS AS IF HE MIGHT BE FEELING VERY GOOD NATURED THIS MORNING LET'S GO ASK HIM WHY JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER GRANDFATHER FROG SAW THEM COMING AND HE GUESSED RIGHT AWAY THAT THEY WERE COMING FOR A STORY
3989-182394-0006 HE GRINNED TO HIMSELF AND PRETENDED TO GO TO SLEEP GOOD MORNING GRANDFATHER FROG SAID JOHNNY CHUCK GRANDFATHER FROG DIDN'T ANSWER JOHNNY TRIED AGAIN AND STILL NO REPLY HE'S ASLEEP
3989-182394-0007 SAID JOHNNY LOOKING DREADFULLY DISAPPOINTED AND I GUESS WE'D BETTER NOT DISTURB HIM FOR HE MIGHT WAKE UP CROSS AND OF COURSE WE WOULDN'T GET A STORY IF HE DID PETER LOOKED AT GRANDFATHER FROG SHARPLY HE WASN'T SO SURE THAT THAT WAS A REAL NAP
3989-182394-0008 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS JUST THE LEAST LITTLE HINT OF A SMILE IN THE CORNERS OF GRANDFATHER FROG'S BIG MOUTH YOU SIT HERE A MINUTE HE WHISPERED IN JOHNNY CHUCK'S EAR
3989-182394-0009 AND PETER HOPPED ALONG THE BANK UNTIL HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND GRANDFATHER FROG NOW JUST AT THAT PLACE ON THE BANK WAS GROWING A TOADSTOOL PETER LOOKED OVER AT JOHNNY CHUCK AND WINKED THEN HE TURNED AROUND
3989-182394-0010 AND WITH ONE OF HIS LONG HIND FEET HE KICKED THE TOADSTOOL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT NOW TOADSTOOLS AS YOU ALL KNOW ARE NOT VERY WELL FASTENED AT THE ROOTS AND THIS ONE WAS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE REST
3989-182394-0011 WHEN PETER KICKED IT IT FLEW OUT INTO THE AIR AND LANDED WITH A GREAT SPLASH IN THE SMILING POOL CLOSE BESIDE THE BIG GREEN LILY PAD ON WHICH GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING OF COURSE HE DIDN'T SEE IT COMING AND OF COURSE IT GAVE HIM A GREAT START
3989-182394-0012 CHUG A RUM EXCLAIMED GRANDFATHER FROG AND DIVED HEAD FIRST INTO THE WATER A MINUTE LATER PETER'S SHARP EYES SAW HIM PEEPING OUT FROM UNDER A LILY PAD TO SEE WHAT HAD FRIGHTENED HIM SO HA HA HA SHOUTED PETER DANCING ABOUT ON THE BANK
3989-182394-0013 HA HA HA GRANDFATHER FROG AFRAID OF A TOADSTOOL HA HA HA AT FIRST GRANDFATHER FROG WAS ANGRY VERY ANGRY INDEED BUT HE IS TOO OLD AND TOO WISE TO LOSE HIS TEMPER FOR LONG OVER A JOKE
3989-182394-0014 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HAS BEEN FAIRLY CAUGHT TRYING TO PLAY A JOKE HIMSELF SO PRESENTLY HE CLIMBED BACK ON TO HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD BLINKING HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES AND LOOKING JUST A WEE BIT FOOLISH CHUG A RUM
3989-182394-0015 SAID HE BUT I THOUGHT IT SURELY WAS A STONE THROWN BY FARMER BROWN'S BOY
3989-182394-0016 JUST TRYING TO GET EVEN WITH YOU FOR TRYING TO FOOL US INTO THINKING THAT YOU WERE ASLEEP WHEN YOU WERE WIDE AWAKE REPLIED PETER OH GRANDFATHER FROG DO TELL US WHY IT IS THAT JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER PLEASE DO
3989-182394-0017 I HAVE A MIND NOT TO JUST TO GET EVEN WITH YOU SAID GRANDFATHER FROG SETTLING HIMSELF COMFORTABLY BUT I BELIEVE I WILL TO SHOW YOU THAT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO CAN TAKE A JOKE WITHOUT LOSING THEIR TEMPER
3989-182394-0018 GOODY CRIED PETER AND JOHNNY CHUCK TOGETHER SITTING DOWN SIDE BY SIDE ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE BANK GRANDFATHER FROG FOLDED HIS HANDS ACROSS HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT AND HALF CLOSED HIS EYES AS IF LOOKING WAY
3989-182394-0019 WAY BACK INTO THE PAST CHUG A RUM HE BEGAN A LONG LONG TIME AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DRY LAND AND MOST OF THE ANIMALS LIVED IN THE WATER YES SIR MOST OF THE ANIMALS LIVED IN THE WATER
3989-182394-0020 AS SENSIBLE ANIMALS DO TO DAY PETER NUDGED JOHNNY CHUCK HE MEANS HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY HE WHISPERED WITH A CHUCKLE AFTER A TIME CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG THERE BEGAN TO BE MORE LAND AND STILL MORE
3989-182394-0021 THEN SOME OF THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME ON THE LAND AS THERE GOT TO BE MORE AND MORE LAND MORE AND MORE OF THE ANIMALS LEFT THE WATER
3989-182394-0022 NOW OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD BEEN KEEPING A SHARP WATCH AS SHE ALWAYS DOES AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THEY WERE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO LIKE THE LAND BEST SHE DID ALL THAT SHE COULD TO MAKE THINGS COMFORTABLE FOR THEM SHE TAUGHT THEM HOW TO RUN AND JUMP AND CLIMB AND DIG
3989-182394-0023 ACCORDING TO WHICH THINGS THEY LIKED BEST TO DO
3989-182394-0024 AND THEY BEGAN TO LOOK DOWN ON THOSE WHO STILL LIVED IN THE WATER AND TO PUT ON AIRS AND HOLD THEIR HEADS VERY HIGH NOW OF COURSE OLD MOTHER NATURE DIDN'T LIKE THIS AND TO PUNISH THEM SHE SAID THAT THEY SHOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THE WATER EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO
3989-182394-0025 AT FIRST THEY ONLY LAUGHED BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY FOUND THAT QUITE OFTEN THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT WOULD BE VERY NICE TO BE AT HOME IN THE WATER AS THEY ONCE HAD BEEN BUT IT WAS OF NO USE SOME COULD SWIM AS LONG AS THEY COULD KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER
3989-182394-0026 PETER NODDED HE KNEW THAT HE COULD SWIM IF HE HAD TO BUT ONLY FOR A VERY LITTLE WAY AND HE HATED THE THOUGHT OF IT NOW THERE WERE A FEW ANIMALS OF WHOM OLD MISTER MUSKRAT THE GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED OF JERRY MUSKRAT WAS ONE
3989-182394-0027 WHO LEARNED TO WALK AND RUN ON DRY LAND BUT WHO STILL LOVED THE WATER CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG ONE DAY OLD MOTHER NATURE FOUND MISTER MUSKRAT SITTING ON A ROCK LOOKING VERY MOURNFUL WHAT'S THE MATTER MISTER MUSKRAT
3989-182394-0028 SHE ASKED MISTER MUSKRAT LOOKED VERY MUCH ASHAMED AS HE FINALLY OWNED UP THAT HE WAS ENVIOUS OF HIS COUSINS AND SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS BECAUSE THEY HAD SUCH FINE HOUSES ON THE LAND THEN WHY DON'T YOU BUILD YOU A FINE HOUSE ON THE LAND
3989-182394-0029 ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE MISTER MUSKRAT HESITATED I
3989-182394-0030 AND AND WELL I WAS PUT IN THE WATER IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I OUGHT TO BE CONTENTED WITH WHAT I HAVE GOT AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS SO PLEASED WITH MISTER MUSKRAT'S REPLY
3989-182394-0031 THAT RIGHT AWAY SHE MADE UP HER MIND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A FINER HOUSE THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS SO SHE TOOK HIM OVER TO A QUIET LITTLE POOL WHERE THE WATER WAS NOT TOO DEEP AND SHE SHOWED HIM HOW TO BUILD A WONDERFUL HOUSE OF MUD AND RUSHES AND TWIGS
3989-182394-0032 WITH A NICE WARM BEDROOM LINED WITH GRASS ABOVE THE WATER AND AN ENTRANCE DOWN UNDER THE WATER SO THAT NO ONE EXCEPT THOSE WHO STILL LIVED MOST OF THE TIME IN THE WATER COULD POSSIBLY GET INTO IT
3989-182394-0033 NONE OF HIS FRIENDS ON LAND HAD SUCH A BIG FINE HOUSE AND MISTER MUSKRAT WAS VERY PROUD OF IT BUT WITH ALL HIS PRIDE HE NEVER FORGOT THAT IT WAS A REWARD FOR TRYING TO BE CONTENT WITH HIS SURROUNDINGS AND MAKING THE BEST OF THEM
3989-182394-0034 SO FROM THAT DAY TO THIS THE MUSKRATS HAVE BUILT THEIR HOUSES IN THE WATER AND HAVE BEEN AMONG THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS CONTENTED AND HAPPY OF ALL THE ANIMALS AND THAT IS WHY JERRY MUSKRAT HAS BUILT THAT FINE HOUSE IN THE SMILING POOL
3989-182394-0035 AND HAS SO FEW ENEMIES CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG PETER RABBIT DREW A LONG BREATH WHICH WAS ALMOST A SIGH I ALMOST WISH MY GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED HAD BEEN CONTENT TO STAY IN THE WATER TOO HE SAID
3989-182394-0036 CHUG A RUM RETORTED GRANDFATHER FROG IF HE HAD
