1430-139231-0000 I HAD TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB BEFORE EVER I HEARD THE SOUND OF THE SUDDEN SCUFFLE AND FROM A VARIETY OF REASONS THE RELIEF OF HAVING HOLLINS'S REVOLVER WITHDRAWN FROM MY NOSE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT MAISIE WAS CLOSE BY
1430-139231-0001 THE GRADUAL WEARING DOWN OF MY NERVES DURING A WHOLE DAY OF HEART SICKENING SUSPENSE BUT NOW THE TREMBLING HAD DEEPENED INTO UTTER SHAKING I HEARD MY OWN TEETH CHATTERING AND MY HEART GOING LIKE A PUMP AS I STOOD THERE
1430-139231-0002 STARING AT THE MAN'S FACE OVER WHICH A GREY PALLOR WAS QUICKLY SPREADING ITSELF AND THOUGH I KNEW THAT HE WAS AS DEAD AS EVER A MAN CAN BE I CALLED TO HIM AND THE SOUND OF MY OWN VOICE FRIGHTENED ME
1430-139231-0003 MISTER HOLLINS I CRIED MISTER HOLLINS AND THEN I WAS FRIGHTENED STILL MORE FOR AS IF IN ANSWER TO MY SUMMONS BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE OF SOME MUSCULAR CONTRACTION FOLLOWING ON DEATH
1430-139231-0004 THE DEAD LIPS SLIGHTLY PARTED AND THEY LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE GRINNING AT ME AT THAT
1430-139231-0005 AND TURNED TO RUN BACK INTO THE ROOM WHERE WE HAD TALKED BUT AS I TURNED THERE WERE SOUNDS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIR AND THE FLASH OF A BULL'S EYE LAMP AND I HEARD CHISHOLM'S VOICE DOWN IN THE GATEWAY BELOW HULLO UP THERE HE WAS DEMANDING
1430-139231-0006 IS THERE ANYBODY ABOVE IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS BURSTING MY CHEST WHEN I GOT AN ANSWER OUT TO HIM OH MAN I SHOUTED COME UP THERE'S ME HERE AND THERE'S MURDER
1430-139231-0007 I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM IN A DISMAYED AND SURPRISED FASHION AND MUTTER SOME WORDS TO SOMEBODY THAT WAS EVIDENTLY WITH HIM AND THEN THERE WAS HEAVY TRAMPING BELOW AND PRESENTLY CHISHOLM'S FACE APPEARED ROUND THE CORNER
1430-139231-0008 AND AS HE HELD HIS BULL'S EYE BEFORE HIM ITS LIGHT FELL FULL ON HOLLINS AND HE JUMPED BACK
1430-139231-0009 MERCY ON US HE LET OUT WHAT'S ALL THIS THE MAN'S LYING DEAD DEAD ENOUGH CHISHOLM SAID I GRADUALLY GETTING THE BETTER OF MY FRIGHT AND MURDERED TOO
1430-139231-0010 BUT WHO MURDERED HIM GOD KNOWS I DON'T HE TRAPPED ME IN HERE NOT TEN MINUTES AGO
1430-139231-0011 AND HE LEFT ME AND HE WAS NO SOONER DOWN THE STAIRS HERE THAN I HEARD A BIT OF A SCUFFLE AND HIM FALL AND GROAN AND I RAN OUT TO FIND THAT AND SOMEBODY WAS OFF AND AWAY HAVE YOU SEEN NOBODY OUTSIDE THERE
1430-139231-0012 YOU CAN'T SEE AN INCH BEFORE YOUR EYES
1430-139231-0013 HE ANSWERED BENDING OVER THE DEAD MAN WE'VE ONLY JUST COME ROUND FROM THE HOUSE BUT WHATEVER WERE YOU DOING HERE YOURSELF I CAME TO SEE IF I COULD FIND ANY TRACE OF MISS DUNLOP IN THIS OLD PART I ANSWERED AND HE TOLD ME
1430-139231-0014 JUST BEFORE THIS HAPPENED SHE'S IN THE TOWER ABOVE AND SAFE AND I'LL GO UP THERE NOW CHISHOLM FOR IF SHE'S HEARD AUGHT OF ALL THIS THERE WAS ANOTHER POLICEMAN WITH HIM AND THEY STEPPED PAST THE BODY
1430-139231-0015 AND FOLLOWED ME INTO THE LITTLE ROOM AND LOOKED ROUND CURIOUSLY I LEFT THEM WHISPERING AND OPENED THE DOOR THAT HOLLINS HAD POINTED OUT THERE WAS A STAIR THERE AS HE HAD SAID SET DEEP IN THE THICK WALL
1430-139231-0016 AND I WENT A LONG WAY UP IT BEFORE I CAME TO ANOTHER DOOR IN WHICH THERE WAS A KEY SET IN THE LOCK AND IN A MOMENT I HAD IT TURNED AND THERE WAS MAISIE
1430-139231-0017 AND I HAD HER IN MY ARMS AND WAS FLOODING HER WITH QUESTIONS AND HOLDING THE LIGHT TO HER FACE TO SEE IF SHE WAS SAFE ALL AT ONCE YOU'VE COME TO NO HARM YOU'RE ALL RIGHT YOU'VE NOT BEEN FRIGHTENED OUT OF YOUR SENSES HOW DID IT ALL COME ABOUT
1430-139231-0018 I RAPPED OUT AT HER OH MAISIE I'VE BEEN SEEKING FOR YOU ALL DAY LONG AND AND THEN BEING UTTERLY OVERWROUGHT I WAS GIVING OUT
1430-139231-0019 QUEER GIDDINESS COMING OVER ME AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HER I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN AND MAYBE FAINTED AND SHE SAW IT AND GOT ME TO A COUCH FROM WHICH SHE HAD STARTED WHEN I TURNED THE KEY
1430-139231-0020 AND WAS HOLDING A GLASS OF WATER TO MY LIPS THAT SHE SNATCHED UP FROM A TABLE AND ENCOURAGING ME WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSOLING HER
1430-139231-0021 AND ME SO WEAK AS IT SEEMED THAT I COULD ONLY CLING ON TO HER HAND MAKING SURE

1430-139231-0042 BE LIKE SEARCHING A RABBIT WARREN YOU'LL HAVE TO GET HELP FROM THE TOWN AYE TO BE SURE HE AGREED BUT WE'LL TAKE A VIEW OF THINGS OURSELVES FIRST THERE MAY BE EFFECTS ON HIM THAT'LL SUGGEST SOMETHING
1430-139231-0043 WE CARRIED THE BODY INTO THE ROOM WHEN THE POLICEMAN CAME UP WITH THE LAMPS FROM THE CAR AND STRETCHED IT OUT ON THE TABLE AT WHICH
1430-139231-0044 AND THERE WAS LITTLE THAT HAD ANY SIGNIFICANCE EXCEPT THAT IN A PURSE WHICH HE CARRIED IN AN INNER POCKET OF HIS WAISTCOAT
1430-139231-0045 THE OTHER POLICEMAN WHO HELD ONE OF THE LAMPS OVER THE TABLE WHILE CHISHOLM WAS MAKING THIS SEARCH WAITED SILENTLY UNTIL IT WAS OVER AND THEN HE NODDED HIS HEAD AT THE STAIR
