7892-294520-0000 SEVENTEEN SIXTY FIVE EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN
7892-294520-0001 TWISTING CONESTOGA RIVER IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA
7892-294520-0002 BY THE SIDE OF ONE OF THEM LAY A GREAT PILE OF NARROW PASTEBOARD TUBES EACH ABOUT TWO FEET LONG AND IN FRONT OF THIS SAME SMALL BOY STOOD A KEG FILLED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE BLACK SAND EACH OF THE GROUP WAS BUSY WORKING WITH ONE OF THE PASTEBOARD TUBES
7892-294520-0003 AND FROM TIME TO TIME DROPPING SMALL COLORED BALLS INTO THE TUBES AT VARIOUS LAYERS OF THE SAND THESE BALLS CAME FROM A BOX THAT WAS GUARDED BY THE SAME BOY WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE TUBES AND THE KEG AND HE DEALT THEM OUT TO THE OTHERS WITH CONTINUAL WORDS OF CAUTION
7892-294520-0004 BE CAREFUL OF THAT ONE GEORGE HE SAID HANDING HIM ONE OF THE COLORED BALLS
7892-294520-0005 BUT THEY'LL BURN SPLENDIDLY AND MAKE A GREAT SHOW WHEN THEY GO OFF HOW DO YOU STOP THE CANDLE WHEN ALL THE BALLS AND POWDER ARE IN ROB ASKED ANOTHER BOY SEE THIS WAY
7892-294520-0006 HE ADDED PROUDLY AS HE LAID THE ROCKET BESIDE THE KEG OF POWDER
7892-294520-0007 LOOKING ADMIRINGLY AT THE LAD OF FOURTEEN WHO HAD JUST SPOKEN I KNEW SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE SAID ROBERT
7892-294520-0008 AND SO I THOUGHT THINGS OVER LAST NIGHT AND WORKED OUT A WAY OF MAKING THESE ROCKETS THEY'LL BE MUCH GRANDER THAN LAST YEAR'S CANDLE PARADE THEY WOULDN'T LET US LIGHT THE STREETS SO WE'LL LIGHT THE SKIES
7892-294520-0009 COULD BE IN LANCASTER TO MORROW NIGHT JUST BEFORE THE WARM SUN DROPPED BEHIND THE TOPS OF THE WALNUT GROVE BEYOND THE RIVER THE WORK WAS DONE
7892-294520-0010 THEY HAD ALL BEEN BORN AND BROUGHT UP NEAR THE WINDING CONESTOGA AND HAD FISHED IN IT AND SWAM IN IT EVER SINCE THEY COULD REMEMBER THE NEXT EVENING THE BOYS OF LANCASTER SPRANG A SURPRISE ON THAT QUIET BUT PATRIOTIC TOWN
7892-294520-0011 THE AUTHORITIES HAD FORBIDDEN THE BURNING OF CANDLES ON ACCOUNT OF THE SCARCITY CAUSED BY THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE AND EVERY ONE EXPECTED THAT SECOND FOURTH OF JULY TO PASS OFF AS QUIETLY AS ANY OTHER DAY
7892-294520-0012 BUT AT DUSK ALL THE BOYS GATHERED AT ROB FULTON'S HOUSE JUST OUTSIDE TOWN
7892-294520-0013 IT TOOK ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO GATHER ENOUGH WOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE SQUARE FOR A GIGANTIC BONFIRE
7892-294520-0014 THE ASTONISHED PEOPLE HEARD ONE DULL THUDDING REPORT AFTER ANOTHER
7892-294520-0015 WERE THE QUESTIONS THAT WENT THROUGH THE WATCHING CROWDS AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE ANSWER TRAVELED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH IT'S ONE OF ROB FULTON'S INVENTIONS HE READ ABOUT MAKING THEM IN SOME BOOK
7892-294520-0016 NODDED HIS HEAD WHEN HE HEARD THIS NEWS
7892-294520-0017 I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT WAS YOUNG ROB I'VE NEVER KNOWN SUCH A BOY FOR MAKING THINGS HIS SCHOOLMASTER TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY THAT WHEN HE WAS ONLY TEN HE MADE HIS OWN LEAD PENCILS PICKING UP ANY BITS OF SHEET LEAD WHICH HAPPENED TO COME HIS WAY
7892-294520-0018 THAT WERE AS GOOD AS ANY IN THE SCHOOL THE FIREWORKS WERE A GREAT SUCCESS FOR THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR THEY HELD THE ATTENTION OF LANCASTER
7892-294520-0019 HAD BEEN SPLENDIDLY KEPT FOR A DAY OR TWO ROB FULTON WAS AN IMPORTANT PERSONAGE THEN HE DROPPED BACK INTO THE RANKS WITH HIS SCHOOLMATES
7892-294520-0020 AND THIS CUMBERSOME CRAFT THEY HAD TO POLE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
7892-294520-0021 AND THERE HAMMER AND SAW AND PLANE TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT GRADUALLY THE BOAT TOOK SHAPE UNDER THEIR HANDS
7892-294520-0022 COULD MAKE BOTH WHEELS REVOLVE BY TURNING THE CRANK
7892-294520-0023 IN A CROTCH AT THE STERN TO STEER THE CRAFT
7892-294520-0024 YET EVEN WHEN THE BOAT WAS FINISHED THE TWO OTHER BOYS WERE VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER SUCH A STRANGE LOOKING OBJECT WOULD REALLY WORK ROBERT HIMSELF HAD NO DOUBTS UPON THAT SCORE
7892-294520-0025 THE MINIATURE SIDE PADDLE RIVER BOAT WAS CHRISTENED THE GEORGE WASHINGTON
7892-294520-0026 THEY TURNED EASILY AND THE BOAT PULLED STEADILY OUT FROM SHORE
7892-294520-0027 IT WAS A PROUD MOMENT FOR THE YOUNG INVENTOR AS THEY WENT DOWN THE RIVER AND PASSED PEOPLE ON THE BANKS HE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AS HE SAW THE SURPRISE ON THEIR FACES
7892-294520-0028 THE LANCASTER SCHOOLMASTER HEARD OF THE BOAT AND SAID TO A FRIEND TAKE MY WORD FOR IT
7892-294520-0029 AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE DISCOURAGED
7892-294520-0030 THAT'S THE SORT OF BOY HE IS
7892-294520-0031 AND AS SOON AS HIS BOAT HAD PROVED ITSELF SUCCESSFUL HE PLANNED A NEW TYPE OF GUN AND SUPPLIED SOME LANCASTER GUNSMITHS WITH COMPLETE DRAWINGS FOR THE WHOLE STOCK LOCK AND BARREL AND MADE ESTIMATES OF RANGE THAT PROVED CORRECT WHEN THE GUN WAS FINISHED
7892-294520-0032 BUT ROB FULTON HAD REMARKABLE TALENTS IN MORE LINES THAN ONE HIS PLAYMATES HAD NICKNAMED HIM QUICKSILVER BOB BECAUSE HE WAS SO FOND OF BUYING THAT GLITTERING METAL
7892-294520-0033 FOR HE COULD TURN FROM ONE OCCUPATION TO ANOTHER
7892-294520-0034 ONE OF WHOM WAS THE FAMOUS MAJOR ANDRE
7892-294520-0035 IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS HAD HELD ITS SESSIONS IN THE OLD COURT HOUSE THERE AND DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THE WAR THE TOWN WAS FAMOUS
7892-294520-0036 LARGE QUANTITIES IN THE AUTUMN OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE MAJOR ANDRE WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED
7892-294520-0037 WAS BROUGHT TO LANCASTER FOR SAFE KEEPING HE WAS ALLOWED CERTAIN LIBERTY ON PAROLE
7892-294520-0038 MAJOR ANDRE WAS VERY FOND OF SKETCHING AND SPENT MUCH OF HIS TIME IN THE FIELDS PAINTING PICTURES OF THE PICTURESQUE LITTLE VILLAGE NO SOONER HAD ROB FULTON HEARD OF THE ENGLISH MAJOR'S SKILL
7892-294520-0039 NO SOONER HAD YOUNG FULTON SEEN THEM
7892-294520-0040 THE REVOLUTION HAD MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN PAINTING MATERIALS FROM ABROAD AND ALMOST ALL THE PAINTS THE BOYS USED WERE HOME MADE FULTON NOW BEGAN TO STUDY THE MAKING OF COLORS AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME WAS ABLE TO ADD TO HIS STOCK
7892-294520-0041 WHEREVER HE WENT THE YOUNG INVENTOR AND PAINTER WAS POPULAR IN THE NEAR NEIGHBORHOOD OF HIS HOME THERE WERE SEVERAL FACTORIES MAKING ARMS AND AMMUNITION FOR THE WAR
7892-294520-0042 QUICKSILVER BOB WAS ALLOWED TO COME AND GO AS HE WOULD
7892-294520-0043 AND THESE OCCUPIED SQUARE HUTS BUILT OF MUD AND SOD
7892-294520-0044 AND WHENEVER THEY WERE FREE FROM SCHOOL DURING THAT TIME
7892-294520-0045 FULTON DREW COUNTLESS PICTURES OF THEM
7892-294520-0046 BUT MANY FAITHFUL COPIES OF WHAT HE SAW WHEN THEY WERE FINISHED THESE PICTURES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND AND SOME OF THEM WERE CARRIED AS FAR
7892-294520-0047 FOUND HIM VERY HARD TO PUT UP WITH AT CERTAIN TIMES
7892-294520-0048 HE WAS QUITE AS LIKELY TO STOP AND WORK IT OUT AS NOT
7892-294520-0049 SEIZING A ROD HE TOLD ROBERT TO HOLD OUT HIS HAND AND GAVE HIM A CANING THERE HE EXCLAIMED I HOPE THAT WILL MAKE YOU DO SOMETHING
7892-294520-0050 AND NOT INTO MY KNUCKLES IT WAS VERY HARD FOR THE TEACHER TO DO MUCH WITH SUCH A LAD
