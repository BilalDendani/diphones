6821-276753-0000 AND POINTS TO THE TIME WHEN THAT STATE MAY DO THOSE THINGS WHICH HE HAS DECLARED IT AN ABSURDITY FOR ANY STATE TO PERFORM I WILL READ A SINGLE PARAGRAPH FROM HIS SPEECH SHOWING
6821-276753-0001 IN ORDER THAT I MAY NOT BY ANY POSSIBILITY
6821-276753-0002 DOES NOT JUSTIFY HERE ARE THE EXPRESSIONS TO WHICH I REFER I CALL THE SENATOR'S ATTENTION TO THEM IF THERE ARE GRIEVANCES WHY CAN NOT WE ALL GO TOGETHER
6821-276753-0003 AND WRITE THEM DOWN AND POINT THEM OUT TO OUR NORTHERN FRIENDS
6821-276753-0004 AND SAY HERE IS WHAT WE DEMAND HERE OUR WRONGS ARE ENUMERATED UPON THESE TERMS WE HAVE AGREED AND NOW AFTER WE HAVE GIVEN YOU A REASONABLE TIME TO CONSIDER THESE ADDITIONAL GUARANTEES IN ORDER TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST THESE WRONGS
6821-276753-0005 IF YOU REFUSE THEM THEN HAVING MADE AN HONORABLE EFFORT HAVING EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER MEANS WE MAY DECLARE THE ASSOCIATION TO BE BROKEN UP AND WE MAY GO INTO AN ACT OF REVOLUTION WE CAN THEN SAY TO THEM
6821-276753-0006 FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR OTHER INTERESTS WHEN THEY DO THIS I WILL GO AS FAR AS HE WHO GOES THE FARTHEST NOW IT DOES APPEAR THAT HE WILL GO THAT FAR
6821-276753-0007 AND HE GOES A LITTLE FURTHER THAN ANYBODY I BELIEVE WHO HAS SPOKEN IN VINDICATION OF THE RIGHT FOR HE SAYS WE DO NOT INTEND THAT YOU SHALL DRIVE US OUT OF THIS HOUSE
6821-276753-0008 THAT WAS REARED BY THE HANDS OF OUR FATHERS IT IS OUR HOUSE IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL HOUSE WE HAVE A RIGHT HERE AND BECAUSE YOU COME FORWARD AND VIOLATE THE ORDINANCES OF THIS HOUSE
6821-276753-0009 I DO NOT INTEND TO GO OUT AND IF YOU PERSIST IN THE VIOLATION OF THE ORDINANCES OF THE HOUSE WE INTEND TO EJECT YOU FROM THE BUILDING AND RETAIN THE POSSESSION OURSELVES
6821-276753-0010 AND THE MILITIA OF THIS CITY TO BE ORGANIZED I THINK IT WAS A MERE FIGURE OF SPEECH
6821-276753-0011 WE WHO CLAIM THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF A STATE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE UNION DO NOT INTEND TO HELP HIM HE SAYS HOWEVER AND THIS SOFTENS IT A LITTLE WE DO NOT THINK THOUGH
6821-276753-0012 THAT WE HAVE JUST CAUSE FOR GOING OUT OF THE UNION NOW WE HAVE JUST CAUSE OF COMPLAINT BUT WE ARE FOR REMAINING IN THE UNION AND FIGHTING THE BATTLE LIKE MEN
6821-276753-0013 IN THE NAME OF COMMON SENSE I ASK
6821-276753-0014 IN THE UNION WE TAKE AN OATH OF OFFICE TO MAINTAIN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES WAS FORMED FOR DOMESTIC TRANQUILLITY AND HOW THEN ARE WE TO FIGHT IN THE UNION
6821-276753-0015 I HAVE HEARD THE PROPOSITION FROM OTHERS BUT I HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD IT I UNDERSTAND HOW MEN FIGHT WHEN THEY ASSUME ATTITUDES OF HOSTILITY BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MEN REMAINING CONNECTED TOGETHER
6821-276753-0016 IN A BOND AS BRETHREN SWORN TO MUTUAL AID AND PROTECTION STILL PROPOSE TO FIGHT EACH OTHER I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SENATOR MEANS IF HE CHOOSES TO ANSWER MY QUESTION I AM WILLING TO HEAR HIM
6821-276753-0017 FOR I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE TO FIGHT IN THE UNION MISTER JOHNSON OF TENNESSEE WHEN MY SPEECH IS TAKEN ALTOGETHER I THINK MY MEANING CAN BE VERY EASILY UNDERSTOOD
6821-276753-0018 I THINK VERY DISTINCTLY AND CLEARLY SET FORTH IN MY SPEECH AND
6821-276753-0019 I APPREHEND THAT HE WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY
6821-276753-0020 BUT FOR HIS GRATIFICATION UPON THIS PARTICULAR POINT I WILL REPEAT IN SUBSTANCE WHAT I THEN SAID AS TO FIGHTING THE BATTLE IN THE UNION I MEANT THAT WE SHOULD REMAIN HERE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
6821-276753-0021 AND CONTEND FOR ALL ITS GUARANTEES AND BY PRESERVING THE CONSTITUTION AND ALL ITS GUARANTEES WE WOULD PRESERVE THE UNION OUR TRUE PLACE TO MAINTAIN THESE GUARANTEES AND TO PRESERVE THE CONSTITUTION
6821-276753-0022 THERE TO FIGHT OUR BATTLE HOW BY ARGUMENT
6821-276753-0023 TO THE GOOD SENSE AND TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY BY SHOWING THE PEOPLE THAT THE CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN VIOLATED THAT ALL ITS GUARANTEES WERE NOT COMPLIED WITH AND I HAVE ENTERTAINED THE HOPE THAT
6821-276753-0024 WHEN THEY WERE POSSESSED OF THAT FACT THERE WOULD BE FOUND PATRIOTISM AND HONESTY ENOUGH
6821-276753-0025 BETWEEN THE CONTENDING SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY I MEANT THAT THE TRUE WAY TO FIGHT THE BATTLE WAS FOR US TO REMAIN HERE AND OCCUPY THE PLACES ASSIGNED TO US BY THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COUNTRY
6821-276753-0026 WHY DID I MAKE THAT STATEMENT IT WAS BECAUSE ON THE FOURTH DAY OF MARCH NEXT WE SHALL HAVE SIX MAJORITY IN THIS BODY AND IF AS SOME APPREHENDED THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION SHALL SHOW ANY DISPOSITION
6821-276753-0027 TO MAKE ENCROACHMENTS UPON THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY ENCROACHMENTS UPON THE RIGHTS OF THE STATES
6821-276753-0028 WE BY REMAINING IN THE UNION AND STANDING AT OUR PLACES WILL HAVE THE POWER TO RESIST ALL THESE ENCROACHMENTS HOW
6821-276753-0029 OF THE INCOMING PRESIDENT THEN SHOULD WE NOT BE FIGHTING THE BATTLES IN THE UNION BY RESISTING EVEN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN A CONSTITUTIONAL MODE AND THUS
6821-276753-0030 AT THE VERY START DISABLE AN ADMINISTRATION WHICH WAS LIKELY TO ENCROACH ON OUR RIGHTS AND TO VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COUNTRY
6821-276753-0031 THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE NO POWER WITHOUT OUR CONSENT IF WE REMAIN HERE IT COMES INTO OFFICE HANDCUFFED POWERLESS TO DO HARM WE STANDING HERE HOLD THE BALANCE OF POWER IN OUR HANDS
6821-276753-0032 WE CAN RESIST IT AT THE VERY THRESHOLD EFFECTUALLY AND DO IT INSIDE OF THE UNION AND IN OUR HOUSE THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT EVEN THE POWER TO APPOINT A POSTMASTER
6821-276753-0033 WHOSE SALARY EXCEEDS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WITHOUT CONSULTATION WITH AND THE ACQUIESCENCE OF THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
6821-276753-0034 HIS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ANNUM UNLESS WE APPROPRIATE IT I CONTEND THEN THAT THE TRUE PLACE TO FIGHT THE BATTLE IS IN THE UNION AND WITHIN THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION
6821-276753-0035 THE ARMY AND NAVY CANNOT BE SUSTAINED WITHOUT APPROPRIATIONS BY CONGRESS AND IF WE WERE APPREHENSIVE THAT ENCROACHMENTS WOULD BE MADE ON THE SOUTHERN STATES AND ON THEIR INSTITUTIONS IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
6821-276753-0036 WE COULD PREVENT HIM FROM HAVING A DOLLAR EVEN TO FEED HIS ARMY OR HIS NAVY MISTER DAVIS I RECEIVE THE ANSWER FROM THE SENATOR AND I THINK I COMPREHEND NOW
6821-276753-0037 THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO USE ANY FORCE BUT IT IS A SORT OF FIGHTING THAT IS TO BE DONE BY VOTES AND WORDS AND I THINK THEREFORE THE PRESIDENT NEED NOT BRING ARTILLERY AND ORDER OUT THE MILITIA TO SUPPRESS THEM
6821-276753-0038 IN THE MODE PROPOSED BY THE SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE MISTER JOHNSON I HAD NOT QUITE DONE BUT IF THE SENATOR IS SATISFIED MISTER DAVIS QUITE SATISFIED I AM ENTIRELY SATISFIED
6821-276753-0039 THAT IT WAS A MERE FIGURE OF SPEECH AND DOES NOT JUSTIFY CONVERTING THE FEDERAL CAPITAL INTO A MILITARY CAMP
6821-276753-0040 A SORT OF REVOLUTION WHICH HE PROPOSES IT IS A REVOLUTION UNDER THE FORMS OF THE GOVERNMENT
6821-276753-0041 THAT AS LONG AS I AM A SENATOR HERE I WILL NOT USE THE POWERS I POSSESS TO DESTROY THE VERY GOVERNMENT TO WHICH I AM ACCREDITED I WILL NOT ATTEMPT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SENATOR TO HANDCUFF THE PRESIDENT
6821-276753-0042 I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THE ADMINISTRATION BY REFUSING ANY OFFICERS TO ADMINISTER ITS FUNCTIONS I SHOULD VOTE AS I HAVE DONE IN ADMINISTRATIONS TO WHICH I STOOD IN NEAREST RELATION AGAINST A BAD NOMINATION BUT I
6821-276753-0043 NEVER WOULD AGREE UNDER THE FORMS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND WITH THE POWERS I BEAR AS A SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES
6821-276753-0044 I WAS SENT TO SUPPORT I LEAVE THAT TO GENTLEMEN WHO TAKE THE OATH WITH A MENTAL RESERVATION IT IS NOT MY POLICY IF I MUST HAVE REVOLUTION I SAY LET IT BE A REVOLUTION SUCH AS OUR FATHERS MADE
6821-276753-0045 WHEN THEY WERE DENIED THEIR NATURAL RIGHTS SO MUCH FOR THAT IT HAS QUIETED APPREHENSION AND I HOPE THAT THE ARTILLERY WILL NOT BE BROUGHT HERE THAT THE MILITIA WILL NOT BE CALLED OUT
6821-276753-0046 AND THAT THE FEMALE SCHOOLS WILL CONTINUE THEIR SESSIONS AS HERETOFORE LAUGHTER THE AUTHORITY
6821-276753-0047 BY THE SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE AND HE READ FAIRLY AN EXTRACT FROM MISTER MADISON'S LETTER TO MISTER WEBSTER
6821-276753-0048 WHAT IT SEEMS TO ME DESTROYS HIS WHOLE ARGUMENT IT IS THIS CLAUSE THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNMENT BEING EXERCISED AS IN OTHER ELECTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF ITS CONSTITUENTS THE PEOPLE
