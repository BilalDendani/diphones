1323-149236-0000 THE VIOLENCE OF REVOLUTIONS IS GENERALLY PROPORTIONED TO THE DEGREE OF THE MALADMINISTRATION WHICH HAS PRODUCED THEM
1323-149236-0001 THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF SCOTLAND HAVING BEEN DURING MANY YEARS FAR MORE OPPRESSIVE AND CORRUPT THAN THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE FALLEN WITH A FAR HEAVIER RUIN THE MOVEMENT AGAINST THE LAST KING OF THE HOUSE OF STUART WAS IN ENGLAND CONSERVATIVE
1323-149236-0002 IN SCOTLAND DESTRUCTIVE THE ENGLISH COMPLAINED NOT OF THE LAW BUT OF THE VIOLATION OF THE LAW THEY ROSE UP AGAINST THE FIRST MAGISTRATE MERELY IN ORDER TO ASSERT THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW THEY WERE FOR THE MOST PART
1323-149236-0003 FROM THE ORDINARY METHODS PRESCRIBED BY THE LAW THE CONVENTION WHICH MET AT WESTMINSTER THOUGH SUMMONED BY IRREGULAR WRITS WAS CONSTITUTED ON THE EXACT MODEL OF A REGULAR PARLIAMENT NO MAN WAS INVITED TO THE UPPER HOUSE
1323-149236-0004 WHOSE RIGHT TO SIT THERE WAS NOT CLEAR THE KNIGHTS AND BURGESSES WERE CHOSEN BY THOSE ELECTORS WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO CHOOSE THE MEMBERS OF A HOUSE OF COMMONS CALLED UNDER THE GREAT SEAL THE FRANCHISES OF THE FORTY SHILLING FREEHOLDER
1323-149236-0005 OF THE HOUSEHOLDER PAYING SCOT AND LOT OF THE BURGAGE TENANT
1323-149236-0006 OF THE MASTER OF ARTS OF OXFORD WERE RESPECTED THE SENSE OF THE CONSTITUENT BODIES WAS TAKEN WITH AS LITTLE VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF MOBS WITH AS LITTLE TRICKERY ON THE PART OF RETURNING OFFICERS AS AT ANY GENERAL ELECTION OF THAT AGE
1323-149236-0007 WHEN AT LENGTH THE ESTATES MET THEIR DELIBERATIONS WERE CARRIED ON WITH PERFECT FREEDOM AND IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ANCIENT FORMS THERE WAS INDEED AFTER THE FIRST FLIGHT OF JAMES
1323-149236-0008 BUT THAT ANARCHY NOWHERE LASTED LONGER THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS FROM THE DAY ON WHICH WILLIAM REACHED SAINT JAMES'S NOT EVEN THE MOST UNPOPULAR AGENTS OF THE FALLEN GOVERNMENT NOT EVEN THE MINISTERS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
1323-149236-0009 HAD ANY THING TO FEAR FROM THE FURY OF THE POPULACE
1323-149236-0010 THE CHURCH ESTABLISHED BY LAW WAS THE MOST ODIOUS INSTITUTION IN THE REALM THE TRIBUNALS HAD PRONOUNCED SOME SENTENCES SO FLAGITIOUS THE PARLIAMENT HAD PASSED SOME ACTS SO OPPRESSIVE THAT UNLESS THOSE SENTENCES AND THOSE ACTS WERE TREATED AS NULLITIES
1323-149236-0011 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING TOGETHER A CONVENTION COMMANDING THE PUBLIC RESPECT AND EXPRESSING THE PUBLIC OPINION IT WAS HARDLY TO BE EXPECTED FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE WHIGS IN THIS DAY OF THEIR POWER WOULD ENDURE TO SEE THEIR HEREDITARY LEADER
1323-149236-0012 THE SON OF A MARTYR THE GRANDSON OF A MARTYR EXCLUDED FROM THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE IN WHICH NINE OF HIS ANCESTORS HAD SATE AS EARLS OF ARGYLE AND EXCLUDED BY A JUDGMENT ON WHICH THE WHOLE KINGDOM CRIED SHAME STILL LESS WAS IT TO BE EXPECTED
1323-149236-0013 THAT THEY WOULD SUFFER THE ELECTION OF MEMBERS FOR COUNTIES AND TOWNS TO BE CONDUCTED ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE EXISTING LAW FOR UNDER THE EXISTING LAW
1323-149236-0014 SEVERAL LORDS WHO HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR HONOURS BY SENTENCES WHICH THE GENERAL VOICE LOUDLY CONDEMNED AS UNJUST AND HE TOOK ON HIMSELF TO DISPENSE WITH THE ACT WHICH DEPRIVED PRESBYTERIANS OF THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE
1323-149236-0015 THE CLERGY OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WERE TO USE THE PHRASE THEN COMMON RABBLED THE MORNING OF CHRISTMAS DAY WAS FIXED FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THESE OUTRAGES FOR NOTHING DISGUSTED THE RIGID COVENANTER
1323-149236-0016 MORE THAN THE REVERENCE PAID BY THE PRELATIST TO THE ANCIENT HOLIDAYS OF THE CHURCH THAT SUCH REVERENCE MAY BE CARRIED TO AN ABSURD EXTREME IS TRUE BUT A PHILOSOPHER MAY PERHAPS BE INCLINED TO THINK THE OPPOSITE EXTREME NOT LESS ABSURD
1323-149236-0017 AND MAY ASK WHY RELIGION SHOULD REJECT THE AID OF ASSOCIATIONS WHICH EXIST IN EVERY NATION SUFFICIENTLY CIVILISED TO HAVE A CALENDAR AND WHICH ARE FOUND BY EXPERIENCE TO HAVE A POWERFUL AND OFTEN A SALUTARY EFFECT
1323-149236-0018 THE PURITAN WHO WAS IN GENERAL BUT TOO READY TO FOLLOW PRECEDENTS AND ANALOGIES DRAWN FROM THE HISTORY AND JURISPRUDENCE OF THE JEWS MIGHT HAVE FOUND IN THE OLD TESTAMENT QUITE AS CLEAR WARRANT FOR KEEPING FESTIVALS IN HONOUR OF GREAT EVENTS
1323-149236-0019 AND SACKED THE CELLAR AND LARDER OF THE MINISTER WHICH AT THAT SEASON WERE PROBABLY BETTER STOCKED THAN USUAL
1323-149236-0020 SOMETIMES BEATEN SOMETIMES DUCKED HIS FURNITURE WAS THROWN OUT OF THE WINDOWS HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN TURNED OUT OF DOORS IN THE SNOW HE WAS THEN CARRIED TO THE MARKET PLACE AND EXPOSED DURING SOME TIME AS A MALEFACTOR
1323-149236-0021 HIS GOWN WAS TORN TO SHREDS OVER HIS HEAD IF HE HAD A PRAYER BOOK IN HIS POCKET IT WAS BURNED AND HE WAS DISMISSED WITH A CHARGE NEVER AS HE VALUED HIS LIFE
1323-149236-0022 SO THE EPISCOPAL PARISH PRIESTS WERE CALLED WERE EXPELLED THE GRAVER COVENANTERS WHILE THEY APPLAUDED THE FERVOUR OF THEIR RIOTOUS BRETHREN WERE APPREHENSIVE THAT PROCEEDINGS SO IRREGULAR MIGHT GIVE SCANDAL AND LEARNED WITH ESPECIAL CONCERN
1323-149236-0023 THAT HERE AND THERE AN ACHAN HAD DISGRACED THE GOOD CAUSE BY STOOPING TO PLUNDER THE CANAANITES WHOM HE OUGHT ONLY TO HAVE SMITTEN A GENERAL MEETING OF MINISTERS AND ELDERS WAS CALLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PREVENTING SUCH DISCREDITABLE EXCESSES
1323-149236-0024 IN THIS MEETING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT FOR THE FUTURE THE EJECTION OF THE ESTABLISHED CLERGY
1323-149236-0025 WERE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OFFENSIVE TO WILLIAM WHO HAD IN THE SOUTH OF THE ISLAND PROTECTED EVEN BENEDICTINES AND FRANCISCANS FROM INSULT AND SPOLIATION BUT THOUGH HE HAD AT THE REQUEST OF A LARGE NUMBER OF THE NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN OF SCOTLAND
1323-149236-0026 TAKEN ON HIMSELF PROVISIONALLY THE EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT KINGDOM THE MEANS OF MAINTAINING ORDER THERE WERE NOT AT HIS COMMAND HE HAD NOT A SINGLE REGIMENT NORTH OF THE TWEED OR INDEED WITHIN MANY MILES OF THAT RIVER
1323-149236-0027 IT WAS VAIN TO HOPE THAT MERE WORDS WOULD QUIET A NATION WHICH HAD NOT IN ANY AGE BEEN VERY AMENABLE TO CONTROL AND WHICH WAS NOW AGITATED BY HOPES AND RESENTMENTS SUCH AS GREAT REVOLUTIONS FOLLOWING GREAT OPPRESSIONS NATURALLY ENGENDER
1323-149236-0028 A PROCLAMATION WAS HOWEVER PUT FORTH DIRECTING THAT ALL PEOPLE SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND THAT TILL THE CONVENTION SHOULD HAVE SETTLED THE GOVERNMENT THE CLERGY OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH SHOULD BE SUFFERED TO RESIDE ON THEIR CURES WITHOUT MOLESTATION
1323-149236-0029 BUT THIS PROCLAMATION NOT BEING SUPPORTED BY TROOPS WAS VERY LITTLE REGARDED ON THE VERY DAY AFTER IT WAS PUBLISHED AT GLASGOW THE VENERABLE CATHEDRAL OF THAT CITY ALMOST THE ONLY FINE CHURCH OF THE MIDDLE AGES WHICH STANDS UNINJURED IN SCOTLAND
1323-149236-0030 WAS ATTACKED BY A CROWD OF PRESBYTERIANS FROM THE MEETING HOUSES WITH WHOM WERE MINGLED MANY OF THEIR FIERCER BRETHREN FROM THE HILLS IT WAS A SUNDAY BUT TO RABBLE A CONGREGATION OF PRELATISTS WAS HELD TO BE A WORK OF NECESSITY AND MERCY
