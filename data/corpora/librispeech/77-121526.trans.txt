77-121526-0000 THUS DID HE SPEAK AND THEY ALL HELD THEIR PEACE THROUGHOUT THE COVERED CLOISTER ENTHRALLED BY THE CHARM OF HIS STORY TILL PRESENTLY ALCINOUS BEGAN TO SPEAK ULYSSES SAID HE
77-121526-0001 NOW THAT YOU HAVE REACHED MY HOUSE I DOUBT NOT YOU WILL GET HOME WITHOUT FURTHER MISADVENTURE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HAVE SUFFERED IN THE PAST TO YOU OTHERS HOWEVER WHO COME HERE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
77-121526-0002 TO DRINK MY CHOICEST WINE AND LISTEN TO MY BARD I WOULD INSIST AS FOLLOWS
77-121526-0003 LET US NOW THEREFORE PRESENT HIM FURTHER EACH ONE OF US WITH A LARGE TRIPOD AND A CAULDRON WE WILL RECOUP OURSELVES BY THE LEVY OF A GENERAL RATE
77-121526-0004 FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF SUCH A HANDSOME PRESENT EVERY ONE APPROVED OF THIS AND THEN THEY WENT HOME TO BED EACH IN HIS OWN ABODE WHEN THE CHILD OF MORNING ROSY FINGERED DAWN APPEARED
77-121526-0005 THEY HURRIED DOWN TO THE SHIP AND BROUGHT THEIR CAULDRONS WITH THEM ALCINOUS WENT ON BOARD AND SAW EVERYTHING SO SECURELY STOWED UNDER THE SHIP'S BENCHES THAT NOTHING COULD BREAK ADRIFT AND INJURE THE ROWERS
77-121526-0006 THEN THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS TO GET DINNER AND HE SACRIFICED A BULL FOR THEM IN HONOUR OF JOVE WHO IS THE LORD OF ALL THEY SET THE STEAKS TO GRILL AND MADE AN EXCELLENT DINNER
77-121526-0007 AFTER WHICH THE INSPIRED BARD DEMODOCUS WHO WAS A FAVOURITE WITH EVERY ONE SANG TO THEM BUT ULYSSES KEPT ON TURNING HIS EYES TOWARDS THE SUN AS THOUGH TO HASTEN HIS SETTING FOR HE WAS LONGING TO BE ON HIS WAY
77-121526-0008 AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN ALL DAY PLOUGHING A FALLOW FIELD WITH A COUPLE OF OXEN KEEPS THINKING ABOUT HIS SUPPER AND IS GLAD WHEN NIGHT COMES THAT HE MAY GO AND GET IT FOR IT IS ALL HIS LEGS CAN DO TO CARRY HIM
77-121526-0009 EVEN SO DID ULYSSES REJOICE WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN AND HE AT ONCE SAID TO THE PHAEACIANS ADDRESSING HIMSELF MORE PARTICULARLY TO KING ALCINOUS SIR AND ALL OF YOU FAREWELL
77-121526-0010 AND MAKING ME PRESENTS WHICH HEAVEN GRANT THAT I MAY TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT
77-121526-0011 INASMUCH AS HE HAD SPOKEN REASONABLY ALCINOUS THEREFORE SAID TO HIS SERVANT PONTONOUS MIX SOME WINE AND HAND IT ROUND TO EVERYBODY THAT WE MAY OFFER A PRAYER TO FATHER JOVE AND SPEED OUR GUEST UPON HIS WAY
77-121526-0012 THE OTHERS EACH FROM HIS OWN SEAT MADE A DRINK OFFERING TO THE BLESSED GODS THAT LIVE IN HEAVEN
77-121526-0013 FAREWELL QUEEN SAID HE HENCEFORWARD AND FOR EVER TILL AGE AND DEATH THE COMMON LOT OF MANKIND LAY THEIR HANDS UPON YOU I NOW TAKE MY LEAVE
77-121526-0014 YOUR PEOPLE AND WITH KING ALCINOUS AS HE SPOKE HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND ALCINOUS SENT A MAN TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS SHIP AND TO THE SEA SHORE
77-121526-0015 WHEN THEY GOT TO THE WATER SIDE THE CREW TOOK THESE THINGS AND PUT THEM ON BOARD WITH ALL THE MEAT AND DRINK BUT FOR ULYSSES THEY SPREAD A RUG AND A LINEN SHEET ON DECK THAT HE MIGHT SLEEP SOUNDLY IN THE STERN OF THE SHIP
77-121526-0016 THEN HE TOO WENT ON BOARD AND LAY DOWN WITHOUT A WORD BUT THE CREW TOOK EVERY MAN HIS PLACE AND LOOSED THE HAWSER FROM THE PIERCED STONE TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN BOUND THEREON WHEN THEY BEGAN ROWING OUT TO SEA ULYSSES FELL INTO A DEEP
77-121526-0017 BOUNDED FORWARD ON HER WAY AS A FOUR IN HAND CHARIOT FLIES OVER THE COURSE WHEN THE HORSES FEEL THE WHIP HER PROW CURVETTED AS IT WERE THE NECK OF A STALLION AND A GREAT WAVE OF DARK BLUE WATER SEETHED IN HER WAKE
77-121526-0018 FORGETFUL OF ALL THAT HE HAD SUFFERED BOTH ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND BY THE WAVES OF THE WEARY SEA WHEN THE BRIGHT STAR THAT HERALDS THE APPROACH OF DAWN BEGAN TO SHOW
77-121526-0019 WHICH LIES BETWEEN TWO POINTS THAT BREAK THE LINE OF THE SEA AND SHUT THE HARBOUR IN
77-121526-0020 SO THAT WHEN ONCE WITHIN IT A SHIP MAY LIE WITHOUT BEING EVEN MOORED AT THE HEAD OF THIS HARBOUR THERE IS A LARGE OLIVE TREE
77-121526-0021 MOREOVER THERE ARE GREAT LOOMS OF STONE ON WHICH THE NYMPHS WEAVE THEIR ROBES OF SEA PURPLE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE AND AT ALL TIMES THERE IS WATER WITHIN IT
77-121526-0022 IT HAS TWO ENTRANCES ONE FACING NORTH BY WHICH MORTALS CAN GO DOWN INTO THE CAVE WHILE THE OTHER COMES FROM THE SOUTH AND IS MORE MYSTERIOUS MORTALS CANNOT POSSIBLY GET IN BY IT IT IS THE WAY TAKEN BY THE GODS INTO THIS HARBOUR
77-121526-0023 THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS TO LIFT ULYSSES WITH HIS RUG AND LINEN SHEET OUT OF THE SHIP AND LAY HIM DOWN UPON THE SAND STILL FAST ASLEEP
77-121526-0024 THEN THEY TOOK OUT THE PRESENTS WHICH MINERVA HAD PERSUADED THE PHAEACIANS TO GIVE HIM WHEN HE WAS SETTING OUT ON HIS VOYAGE HOMEWARDS THEY PUT THESE ALL TOGETHER BY THE ROOT OF THE OLIVE TREE AWAY FROM THE ROAD
77-121526-0025 AND THEN THEY MADE THE BEST OF THEIR WAY HOME AGAIN BUT NEPTUNE DID NOT FORGET THE THREATS WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY THREATENED ULYSSES SO HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH JOVE FATHER JOVE SAID HE
77-121526-0026 I SHALL NO LONGER BE HELD IN ANY SORT OF RESPECT AMONG YOU GODS IF MORTALS LIKE THE PHAEACIANS WHO ARE MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD SHOW SUCH SMALL REGARD FOR ME
77-121526-0027 WHEN HE HAD SUFFERED SUFFICIENTLY I DID NOT SAY THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GET HOME AT ALL FOR I KNEW YOU HAD ALREADY NODDED YOUR HEAD ABOUT IT AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD DO SO
77-121526-0028 BUT NOW THEY HAVE BROUGHT HIM IN A SHIP FAST ASLEEP AND HAVE LANDED HIM IN ITHACA AFTER LOADING HIM WITH MORE MAGNIFICENT PRESENTS OF BRONZE GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD EVER HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
77-121526-0029 IF HE HAD HAD HIS SHARE OF THE SPOIL AND GOT HOME WITHOUT MISADVENTURE AND JOVE ANSWERED WHAT O LORD OF THE EARTHQUAKE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
77-121526-0030 AS REGARDS MORTALS HOWEVER IF ANY OF THEM IS INDULGING IN INSOLENCE AND TREATING YOU DISRESPECTFULLY IT WILL ALWAYS REST WITH YOURSELF TO DEAL WITH HIM AS YOU MAY THINK PROPER SO DO JUST AS YOU PLEASE
77-121526-0031 I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO AT ONCE REPLIED NEPTUNE IF I WERE NOT ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANYTHING THAT MIGHT DISPLEASE YOU NOW THEREFORE I SHOULD LIKE TO WRECK THE PHAEACIAN SHIP AS IT IS RETURNING FROM ITS ESCORT
77-121526-0032 THIS WILL STOP THEM FROM ESCORTING PEOPLE IN FUTURE AND I SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO BURY THEIR CITY UNDER A HUGE MOUNTAIN MY GOOD FRIEND ANSWERED JOVE I SHOULD RECOMMEND YOU AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE PEOPLE FROM THE CITY ARE WATCHING THE SHIP ON HER WAY
77-121526-0033 THIS WILL ASTONISH EVERYBODY AND YOU CAN THEN BURY THEIR CITY UNDER THE MOUNTAIN WHEN EARTH ENCIRCLING NEPTUNE HEARD THIS HE WENT TO SCHERIA WHERE THE PHAEACIANS LIVE AND STAYED THERE TILL THE SHIP WHICH WAS MAKING RAPID WAY HAD GOT CLOSE IN
77-121526-0034 TURNED IT INTO STONE AND DROVE IT DOWN WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HAND SO AS TO ROOT IT IN THE GROUND AFTER THIS HE WENT AWAY THE PHAEACIANS THEN BEGAN TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES AND ONE WOULD TURN TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOUR
77-121526-0035 SAYING BLESS MY HEART WHO IS IT THAT CAN HAVE ROOTED THE SHIP IN THE SEA JUST AS SHE WAS GETTING INTO PORT WE COULD SEE THE WHOLE OF HER
77-121526-0036 BUT THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND ALCINOUS SAID I REMEMBER NOW THE OLD PROPHECY OF MY FATHER HE SAID THAT NEPTUNE WOULD BE ANGRY WITH US FOR TAKING EVERY ONE SO SAFELY OVER THE SEA AND WOULD ONE DAY WRECK A PHAEACIAN SHIP
77-121526-0037 AS IT WAS RETURNING FROM AN ESCORT AND BURY OUR CITY UNDER A HIGH MOUNTAIN
77-121526-0038 IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MUST LEAVE OFF GIVING PEOPLE ESCORTS WHEN THEY COME HERE AND IN THE NEXT LET US SACRIFICE TWELVE PICKED BULLS TO NEPTUNE THAT HE MAY HAVE MERCY UPON US AND NOT BURY OUR CITY UNDER THE HIGH MOUNTAIN
77-121526-0039 WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY WERE AFRAID AND GOT READY THE BULLS
77-121526-0040 UPON HIS OWN SOIL HE HAD BEEN SO LONG AWAY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IT AGAIN MOREOVER
77-121526-0041 THE PRECIPICES AND THE GOODLY TREES APPEARED ALL CHANGED AS HE STARTED UP AND LOOKED UPON HIS NATIVE LAND SO HE SMOTE HIS THIGHS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HANDS AND CRIED ALOUD DESPAIRINGLY ALAS
77-121526-0042 HE EXCLAIMED AMONG WHAT MANNER OF PEOPLE AM I FALLEN ARE THEY SAVAGE AND UNCIVILISED OR HOSPITABLE AND HUMANE WHERE SHALL I PUT ALL THIS TREASURE AND WHICH WAY SHALL I GO
