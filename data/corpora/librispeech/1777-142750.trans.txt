1777-142750-0000 SO FAR AS THINGS ARE CONCERNED WE MAY KNOW THEM OR NOT KNOW THEM BUT THERE IS NO POSITIVE STATE OF MIND WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED AS ERRONEOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS SO LONG AT ANY RATE AS WE CONFINE OURSELVES TO KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE WHATEVER WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH MUST BE SOMETHING
1777-142750-0001 WE MAY DRAW WRONG INFERENCES FROM OUR ACQUAINTANCE BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE ITSELF CANNOT BE DECEPTIVE THUS THERE IS NO DUALISM AS REGARDS ACQUAINTANCE BUT AS REGARDS KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTHS THERE IS A DUALISM WE MAY BELIEVE WHAT IS FALSE AS WELL AS WHAT IS TRUE
1777-142750-0002 WE KNOW THAT ON VERY MANY SUBJECTS DIFFERENT PEOPLE HOLD DIFFERENT AND INCOMPATIBLE OPINIONS HENCE SOME BELIEFS MUST BE ERRONEOUS SINCE ERRONEOUS BELIEFS ARE OFTEN HELD JUST AS STRONGLY AS TRUE BELIEFS IT BECOMES A DIFFICULT QUESTION HOW THEY ARE TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM TRUE BELIEFS
1777-142750-0003 HOW ARE WE TO KNOW IN A GIVEN CASE THAT OUR BELIEF IS NOT ERRONEOUS THIS IS A QUESTION OF THE VERY GREATEST DIFFICULTY TO WHICH NO COMPLETELY SATISFACTORY ANSWER IS POSSIBLE THERE IS HOWEVER A PRELIMINARY QUESTION WHICH IS RATHER LESS DIFFICULT AND THAT IS
1777-142750-0004 WHAT DO WE MEAN BY TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD IT IS THIS PRELIMINARY QUESTION WHICH IS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THIS CHAPTER IN THIS CHAPTER WE ARE NOT ASKING HOW WE CAN KNOW WHETHER A BELIEF IS TRUE OR FALSE WE ARE ASKING WHAT IS MEANT BY THE QUESTION WHETHER A BELIEF IS TRUE OR FALSE
1777-142750-0005 IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT A CLEAR ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION MAY HELP US TO OBTAIN AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHAT BELIEFS ARE TRUE BUT FOR THE PRESENT WE ASK ONLY WHAT IS TRUTH AND WHAT IS FALSEHOOD NOT WHAT BELIEFS ARE TRUE AND WHAT BELIEFS ARE FALSE
1777-142750-0006 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THESE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ENTIRELY SEPARATE SINCE ANY CONFUSION BETWEEN THEM IS SURE TO PRODUCE AN ANSWER WHICH IS NOT REALLY APPLICABLE TO EITHER THERE ARE THREE POINTS TO OBSERVE IN THE ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER THE NATURE OF TRUTH
1777-142750-0007 THREE REQUISITES WHICH ANY THEORY MUST FULFIL ONE OUR THEORY OF TRUTH MUST BE SUCH AS TO ADMIT OF ITS OPPOSITE FALSEHOOD A GOOD MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE FAILED ADEQUATELY TO SATISFY THIS CONDITION
1777-142750-0008 THEY HAVE CONSTRUCTED THEORIES ACCORDING TO WHICH ALL OUR THINKING OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TRUE AND HAVE THEN HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A PLACE FOR FALSEHOOD IN THIS RESPECT OUR THEORY OF BELIEF MUST DIFFER FROM OUR THEORY OF ACQUAINTANCE SINCE IN THE CASE OF ACQUAINTANCE IT WAS NOT NECESSARY
1777-142750-0009 TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF ANY OPPOSITE TWO IT SEEMS FAIRLY EVIDENT THAT IF THERE WERE NO BELIEFS THERE COULD BE NO FALSEHOOD AND NO TRUTH EITHER IN THE SENSE IN WHICH TRUTH IS CORRELATIVE TO FALSEHOOD IF WE IMAGINE A WORLD OF MERE MATTER THERE WOULD BE NO ROOM FOR FALSEHOOD IN SUCH A WORLD
1777-142750-0010 IT WOULD NOT CONTAIN ANY TRUTHS IN THE SENSE IN WHICH TRUTHS ARE THINGS OF THE SAME KIND AS FALSEHOODS IN FACT TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD ARE PROPERTIES OF BELIEFS AND STATEMENTS HENCE A WORLD OF MERE MATTER SINCE IT WOULD CONTAIN NO BELIEFS OR STATEMENTS WOULD ALSO CONTAIN
1777-142750-0011 NO TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD THREE BUT AS AGAINST WHAT WE HAVE JUST SAID IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THE TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD OF A BELIEF ALWAYS DEPENDS UPON SOMETHING WHICH LIES OUTSIDE THE BELIEF ITSELF
1777-142750-0012 WHICH SHALL NOT CONSIST IN RELATION TO SOMETHING WHOLLY OUTSIDE BELIEF THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTEMPT AT A DEFINITION OF THIS SORT IS THE THEORY THAT TRUTH CONSISTS IN COHERENCE IT IS SAID THAT THE MARK OF FALSEHOOD IS FAILURE TO COHERE IN THE BODY OF OUR BELIEFS
1777-142750-0013 AND THAT IT IS THE ESSENCE OF A TRUTH TO FORM PART OF THE COMPLETELY ROUNDED SYSTEM WHICH IS THE TRUTH THERE IS HOWEVER A GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THIS VIEW OR RATHER TWO GREAT DIFFICULTIES THE FIRST IS THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ONLY ONE COHERENT BODY OF BELIEFS IS POSSIBLE
1777-142750-0014 IT MAY BE THAT WITH SUFFICIENT IMAGINATION A NOVELIST MIGHT INVENT A PAST FOR THE WORLD THAT WOULD PERFECTLY FIT ON TO WHAT WE KNOW AND YET BE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE REAL PAST IN MORE SCIENTIFIC MATTERS IT IS CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE OFTEN TWO OR MORE HYPOTHESES
1777-142750-0015 WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE KNOWN FACTS ON SOME SUBJECT AND ALTHOUGH IN SUCH CASES MEN OF SCIENCE ENDEAVOUR TO FIND FACTS WHICH WILL RULE OUT ALL THE HYPOTHESES EXCEPT ONE THERE IS NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD ALWAYS SUCCEED
1777-142750-0016 IN PHILOSOPHY AGAIN IT SEEMS NOT UNCOMMON FOR TWO RIVAL HYPOTHESES TO BE BOTH ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE FACTS THUS FOR EXAMPLE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LIFE IS ONE LONG DREAM AND THAT THE OUTER WORLD HAS ONLY THAT DEGREE OF REALITY THAT THE OBJECTS OF DREAMS HAVE
1777-142750-0017 BUT ALTHOUGH SUCH A VIEW DOES NOT SEEM INCONSISTENT WITH KNOWN FACTS THERE IS NO REASON TO PREFER IT TO THE COMMON SENSE VIEW ACCORDING TO WHICH OTHER PEOPLE AND THINGS DO REALLY EXIST THUS COHERENCE AS THE DEFINITION OF TRUTH FAILS BECAUSE THERE IS NO PROOF THAT THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE COHERENT SYSTEM
1777-142750-0018 THE OTHER OBJECTION TO THIS DEFINITION OF TRUTH IS THAT IT ASSUMES THE MEANING OF COHERENCE KNOWN WHEREAS IN FACT COHERENCE PRESUPPOSES THE TRUTH OF THE LAWS OF LOGIC TWO PROPOSITIONS ARE COHERENT WHEN BOTH MAY BE TRUE AND ARE INCOHERENT WHEN ONE AT LEAST MUST BE FALSE
1777-142750-0019 NOW IN ORDER TO KNOW WHETHER TWO PROPOSITIONS CAN BOTH BE TRUE WE MUST KNOW SUCH TRUTHS AS THE LAW OF CONTRADICTION FOR EXAMPLE THE TWO PROPOSITIONS THIS TREE IS A BEECH AND THIS TREE IS NOT A BEECH ARE NOT COHERENT BECAUSE OF THE LAW OF CONTRADICTION
1777-142750-0020 WERE SUBJECTED TO THE TEST OF COHERENCE WE SHOULD FIND THAT IF WE CHOOSE TO SUPPOSE IT FALSE NOTHING WILL ANY LONGER BE INCOHERENT WITH ANYTHING ELSE THUS THE LAWS OF LOGIC SUPPLY THE SKELETON OR FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH THE TEST OF COHERENCE APPLIES AND THEY THEMSELVES
1777-142750-0021 CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED BY THIS TEST FOR THE ABOVE TWO REASONS COHERENCE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS GIVING THE MEANING OF TRUTH THOUGH IT IS OFTEN A MOST IMPORTANT TEST OF TRUTH AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TRUTH HAS BECOME KNOWN
1777-142750-0022 IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR THREE REQUISITES WE HAVE TO SEEK A THEORY OF TRUTH WHICH ONE ALLOWS TRUTH TO HAVE AN OPPOSITE NAMELY FALSEHOOD TWO MAKES TRUTH A PROPERTY OF BELIEFS BUT THREE MAKES IT A PROPERTY WHOLLY DEPENDENT UPON THE RELATION OF THE BELIEFS TO OUTSIDE THINGS
1777-142750-0023 THE NECESSITY OF ALLOWING FOR FALSEHOOD MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REGARD BELIEF AS A RELATION OF THE MIND TO A SINGLE OBJECT WHICH COULD BE SAID TO BE WHAT IS BELIEVED IF BELIEF WERE SO REGARDED WE SHOULD FIND THAT LIKE ACQUAINTANCE
1777-142750-0024 FOR IF THERE WERE SUCH AN OBJECT THE BELIEF WOULD BE TRUE THERE IS IN FACT NO SUCH OBJECT AND THEREFORE OTHELLO CANNOT HAVE ANY RELATION TO SUCH AN OBJECT HENCE HIS BELIEF CANNOT POSSIBLY CONSIST IN A RELATION TO THIS OBJECT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HIS BELIEF
1777-142750-0025 IS A RELATION TO A DIFFERENT OBJECT NAMELY THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO BUT IT IS ALMOST AS DIFFICULT TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS SUCH AN OBJECT AS THIS WHEN DESDEMONA DOES NOT LOVE CASSIO AS IT WAS TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS DESDEMONA'S LOVE FOR CASSIO
1777-142750-0026 HENCE IT WILL BE BETTER TO SEEK FOR A THEORY OF BELIEF WHICH DOES NOT MAKE IT CONSIST IN A RELATION OF THE MIND TO A SINGLE OBJECT IT IS COMMON TO THINK OF RELATIONS AS THOUGH THEY ALWAYS HELD BETWEEN TWO TERMS BUT IN FACT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
1777-142750-0027 SOME RELATIONS DEMAND THREE TERMS SOME FOUR AND SO ON TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE RELATION BETWEEN SO LONG AS ONLY TWO TERMS COME IN THE RELATION BETWEEN IS IMPOSSIBLE THREE TERMS ARE THE SMALLEST NUMBER THAT RENDER IT POSSIBLE YORK IS BETWEEN LONDON AND EDINBURGH
1777-142750-0028 SIMILARLY JEALOUSY REQUIRES THREE PEOPLE THERE CAN BE NO SUCH RELATION THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE THREE AT LEAST
1777-142750-0029 INVOLVES A RELATION OF FOUR TERMS THAT IS TO SAY A AND B AND C AND D ALL COME IN AND THE RELATION INVOLVED CANNOT BE EXPRESSED OTHERWISE THAN IN A FORM INVOLVING ALL FOUR INSTANCES MIGHT BE MULTIPLIED INDEFINITELY
1777-142750-0030 BUT ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID TO SHOW THAT THERE ARE RELATIONS WHICH REQUIRE MORE THAN TWO TERMS BEFORE THEY CAN OCCUR THE RELATION INVOLVED IN JUDGING OR BELIEVING MUST IF FALSEHOOD IS TO BE DULY ALLOWED FOR BE TAKEN TO BE A RELATION BETWEEN SEVERAL TERMS NOT BETWEEN TWO
1777-142750-0031 WHEN OTHELLO BELIEVES THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO HE MUST NOT HAVE BEFORE HIS MIND A SINGLE OBJECT DESDEMONA'S LOVE FOR CASSIO OR THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO FOR THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THERE SHOULD BE OBJECTIVE FALSEHOODS WHICH SUBSIST INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY MINDS
1777-142750-0032 AND THIS THOUGH NOT LOGICALLY REFUTABLE IS A THEORY TO BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE THUS IT IS EASIER TO ACCOUNT FOR FALSEHOOD IF WE TAKE JUDGEMENT TO BE A RELATION IN WHICH THE MIND AND THE VARIOUS OBJECTS CONCERNED ALL OCCUR SEVERALLY
1777-142750-0033 THAT IS TO SAY DESDEMONA AND LOVING AND CASSIO MUST ALL BE TERMS IN THE RELATION WHICH SUBSISTS WHEN OTHELLO BELIEVES THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO
1777-142750-0034 SINCE OTHELLO ALSO IS ONE OF THE TERMS OF THE RELATION WHEN WE SAY THAT IT IS A RELATION OF FOUR TERMS WE DO NOT MEAN THAT OTHELLO HAS A CERTAIN RELATION TO DESDEMONA AND HAS THE SAME RELATION TO LOVING AND ALSO TO CASSIO THIS MAY BE TRUE OF SOME OTHER RELATION THAN BELIEVING
1777-142750-0035 BUT BELIEVING PLAINLY IS NOT A RELATION WHICH OTHELLO HAS TO EACH OF THE THREE TERMS CONCERNED BUT TO ALL OF THEM TOGETHER THERE IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF THE RELATION OF BELIEVING INVOLVED BUT THIS ONE EXAMPLE KNITS TOGETHER FOUR TERMS
1777-142750-0036 WE ARE NOW IN A POSITION TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT DISTINGUISHES A TRUE JUDGEMENT FROM A FALSE ONE FOR THIS PURPOSE WE WILL ADOPT CERTAIN DEFINITIONS IN EVERY ACT OF JUDGEMENT THERE IS A MIND WHICH JUDGES AND THERE ARE TERMS CONCERNING WHICH IT JUDGES
1777-142750-0037 THE SUBJECT AND THE OBJECTS TOGETHER ARE CALLED THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE JUDGEMENT IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT THE RELATION OF JUDGING HAS WHAT IS CALLED A SENSE OR DIRECTION WE MAY SAY METAPHORICALLY THAT IT PUTS ITS OBJECTS IN A CERTAIN ORDER
1777-142750-0038 WHICH WE MAY INDICATE BY MEANS OF THE ORDER OF THE WORDS IN THE SENTENCE IN AN INFLECTED LANGUAGE THE SAME THING WILL BE INDICATED BY INFLECTIONS E G BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOMINATIVE AND ACCUSATIVE OTHELLO'S JUDGEMENT THAT CASSIO LOVES DESDEMONA DIFFERS FROM HIS JUDGEMENT
1777-142750-0039 THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT CONSISTS OF THE SAME CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE THE RELATION OF JUDGING PLACES THE CONSTITUENTS IN A DIFFERENT ORDER IN THE TWO CASES SIMILARLY IF CASSIO JUDGES THAT DESDEMONA LOVES OTHELLO THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE JUDGEMENT ARE STILL THE SAME
1777-142750-0040 BUT THEIR ORDER IS DIFFERENT THIS PROPERTY OF HAVING A SENSE OR DIRECTION IS ONE WHICH THE RELATION OF JUDGING SHARES WITH ALL OTHER RELATIONS THE SENSE OF RELATIONS IS THE ULTIMATE SOURCE OF ORDER AND SERIES AND A HOST OF MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS BUT WE NEED NOT CONCERN OURSELVES FURTHER
1777-142750-0041 WITH THIS ASPECT WE SPOKE OF THE RELATION CALLED JUDGING OR BELIEVING AS KNITTING TOGETHER INTO ONE COMPLEX WHOLE THE SUBJECT AND THE OBJECTS IN THIS RESPECT JUDGING IS EXACTLY LIKE EVERY OTHER RELATION WHENEVER A RELATION HOLDS BETWEEN TWO OR MORE TERMS
1777-142750-0042 IT UNITES THE TERMS INTO A COMPLEX WHOLE IF OTHELLO LOVES DESDEMONA THERE IS SUCH A COMPLEX WHOLE AS OTHELLO'S LOVE FOR DESDEMONA THE TERMS UNITED BY THE RELATION MAY BE THEMSELVES COMPLEX OR MAY BE SIMPLE BUT THE WHOLE WHICH RESULTS FROM THEIR BEING UNITED MUST BE COMPLEX
1777-142750-0043 WHEREVER THERE IS A RELATION WHICH RELATES CERTAIN TERMS THERE IS A COMPLEX OBJECT FORMED OF THE UNION OF THOSE TERMS AND CONVERSELY WHEREVER THERE IS A COMPLEX OBJECT THERE IS A RELATION WHICH RELATES ITS CONSTITUENTS WHEN AN ACT OF BELIEVING OCCURS THERE IS A COMPLEX IN WHICH
1777-142750-0044 BELIEVING IS THE UNITING RELATION AND SUBJECT AND OBJECTS ARE ARRANGED IN A CERTAIN ORDER BY THE SENSE OF THE RELATION OF BELIEVING AMONG THE OBJECTS AS WE SAW IN CONSIDERING OTHELLO BELIEVES THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO ONE MUST BE A RELATION IN THIS INSTANCE THE RELATION LOVING
1777-142750-0045 IS NOT THE RELATION WHICH CREATES THE UNITY OF THE COMPLEX WHOLE
1777-142750-0046 THE RELATION LOVING AS IT OCCURS IN THE ACT OF BELIEVING IS ONE OF THE OBJECTS IT IS A BRICK IN THE STRUCTURE NOT THE CEMENT THE CEMENT IS THE RELATION BELIEVING WHEN THE BELIEF IS TRUE THERE IS ANOTHER COMPLEX UNITY
1777-142750-0047 IN WHICH THE RELATION WHICH WAS ONE OF THE OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF RELATES THE OTHER OBJECTS THUS E G IF OTHELLO BELIEVES TRULY THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO THEN THERE IS A COMPLEX UNITY DESDEMONA'S LOVE FOR CASSIO
1777-142750-0048 WHICH IS COMPOSED EXCLUSIVELY OF THE OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF IN THE SAME ORDER AS THEY HAD IN THE BELIEF WITH THE RELATION WHICH WAS ONE OF THE OBJECTS OCCURRING NOW AS THE CEMENT THAT BINDS TOGETHER THE OTHER OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF
1777-142750-0049 ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN A BELIEF IS FALSE THERE IS NO SUCH COMPLEX UNITY COMPOSED ONLY OF THE OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF IF OTHELLO BELIEVES FALSELY THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO THEN THERE IS NO SUCH COMPLEX UNITY AS DESDEMONA'S LOVE FOR CASSIO
1777-142750-0050 THUS A BELIEF IS TRUE WHEN IT CORRESPONDS TO A CERTAIN ASSOCIATED COMPLEX AND FALSE WHEN IT DOES NOT ASSUMING FOR THE SAKE OF DEFINITENESS THAT THE OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF ARE TWO TERMS AND A RELATION
1777-142750-0051 OF WHICH A MIND IS A CONSTITUENT IF THE REMAINING CONSTITUENTS TAKEN IN THE ORDER WHICH THEY HAVE IN THE BELIEF FORM A COMPLEX UNITY THEN THE BELIEF IS TRUE IF NOT IT IS FALSE
1777-142750-0052 THUS ALTHOUGH TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD ARE PROPERTIES OF BELIEFS YET THEY ARE IN A SENSE EXTRINSIC PROPERTIES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE TRUTH OF A BELIEF IS SOMETHING NOT INVOLVING BELIEFS OR IN GENERAL ANY MIND AT ALL BUT ONLY THE OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF
1777-142750-0053 A MIND WHICH BELIEVES BELIEVES TRULY WHEN THERE IS A CORRESPONDING COMPLEX NOT INVOLVING THE MIND BUT ONLY ITS OBJECTS THIS CORRESPONDENCE ENSURES TRUTH AND ITS ABSENCE ENTAILS FALSEHOOD
1777-142750-0054 WHEN THERE IS A CORRESPONDING FACT AND IS FALSE WHEN THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING FACT IT WILL BE SEEN THAT MINDS DO NOT CREATE TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD THEY CREATE BELIEFS BUT WHEN ONCE THE BELIEFS ARE CREATED THE MIND CANNOT MAKE THEM TRUE OR FALSE
1777-142750-0055 EXCEPT IN THE SPECIAL CASE WHERE THEY CONCERN FUTURE THINGS WHICH ARE WITHIN THE POWER OF THE PERSON BELIEVING SUCH AS CATCHING TRAINS WHAT MAKES A BELIEF TRUE IS A FACT AND THIS FACT DOES NOT EXCEPT IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES
