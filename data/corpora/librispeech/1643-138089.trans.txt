1643-138089-0001 WITH THE PASSION WITHOUT IT WE ARE MEANINGLESS FRAGMENTS HALF MONKS HALF BEASTS UNCONNECTED ARCHES THAT HAVE NEVER JOINED INTO A MAN WITH IT LOVE IS BORN

1643-138089-0003 THE ROADS OF HIS SOUL LIE CLEAR AND HE AND HIS FRIENDS SHALL FIND EASY GOING IT WAS HARD GOING IN THE ROADS OF MISTER WILCOX'S SOUL FROM BOYHOOD HE HAD NEGLECTED THEM
1643-138089-0004 OUTWARDLY HE WAS CHEERFUL RELIABLE AND BRAVE BUT WITHIN ALL HAD REVERTED TO CHAOS RULED SO FAR AS IT WAS RULED AT ALL BY AN INCOMPLETE ASCETICISM
1643-138089-0005 WHETHER AS BOY HUSBAND OR WIDOWER HE HAD ALWAYS THE SNEAKING BELIEF THAT BODILY PASSION IS BAD
1643-138089-0006 RELIGION HAD CONFIRMED HIM
1643-138089-0007 AND SAINT FRANCIS INTO A WHITE HOT HATRED OF THE CARNAL HE COULD NOT BE AS THE SAINTS AND LOVE THE INFINITE WITH A SERAPHIC ARDOUR BUT HE COULD BE A LITTLE ASHAMED OF LOVING A WIFE
1643-138089-0008 HOPED TO HELP HIM IT DID NOT SEEM SO DIFFICULT SHE NEED TROUBLE HIM WITH NO GIFT OF HER OWN SHE WOULD ONLY POINT OUT THE SALVATION
1643-138089-0009 ONLY CONNECT THAT WAS THE WHOLE OF HER SERMON ONLY CONNECT THE PROSE AND THE PASSION AND BOTH WILL BE EXALTED AND HUMAN LOVE WILL BE SEEN AT ITS HEIGHT
1643-138089-0010 LIVE IN FRAGMENTS NO LONGER ONLY CONNECT AND THE BEAST AND THE MONK ROBBED OF THE ISOLATION THAT IS LIFE TO EITHER WILL DIE

1643-138089-0013 OR THAT TIBBY WAS NOT INTERESTED IN CURRANT PLANTATIONS HE NEVER NOTICED THE LIGHTS AND SHADES THAT EXIST IN THE GRAYEST CONVERSATION THE FINGER POSTS THE MILESTONES THE COLLISIONS THE ILLIMITABLE VIEWS
