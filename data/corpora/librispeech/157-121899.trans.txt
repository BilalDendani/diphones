157-121899-0000 I QUITE AGREE SAID I TRULY ALL THY REASONINGS HOLD ADMIRABLY TOGETHER THEN SAID SHE WHAT VALUE WOULDST THOU PUT UPON THE BOON SHOULDST THOU COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ABSOLUTE GOOD OH AN INFINITE SAID I
157-121899-0001 IF ONLY I WERE SO BLEST AS TO LEARN TO KNOW GOD ALSO WHO IS THE GOOD YET THIS WILL I MAKE CLEAR TO THEE ON TRUEST GROUNDS OF REASON IF ONLY OUR RECENT CONCLUSIONS STAND FAST THEY WILL
157-121899-0002 HAVE WE NOT SHOWN THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH MOST MEN DESIRE ARE NOT TRUE AND PERFECT GOOD PRECISELY FOR THIS CAUSE THAT THEY DIFFER SEVERALLY ONE FROM ANOTHER AND SEEING THAT ONE IS WANTING TO ANOTHER
157-121899-0003 THEY CANNOT BESTOW FULL AND ABSOLUTE GOOD BUT THAT THEY BECOME THE TRUE GOOD WHEN THEY ARE GATHERED AS IT WERE INTO ONE FORM AND AGENCY SO THAT THAT WHICH IS INDEPENDENCE IS LIKEWISE POWER REVERENCE RENOWN
157-121899-0004 AND PLEASANT DELIGHT AND UNLESS THEY ARE ALL ONE AND THE SAME THEY HAVE NO CLAIM TO BE COUNTED AMONG THINGS DESIRABLE YES THIS WAS CLEARLY PROVED AND CANNOT IN ANY WISE BE DOUBTED NOW
157-121899-0005 WHEN THINGS ARE FAR FROM BEING GOOD WHILE THEY ARE DIFFERENT BUT BECOME GOOD AS SOON AS THEY ARE ONE IS IT NOT TRUE THAT THESE BECOME GOOD BY ACQUIRING UNITY IT SEEMS SO SAID I
157-121899-0006 BUT DOST NOT THOU ALLOW THAT ALL WHICH IS GOOD IS GOOD BY PARTICIPATION IN GOODNESS IT IS THEN THOU MUST ON SIMILAR GROUNDS ADMIT THAT UNITY AND GOODNESS ARE THE SAME
157-121899-0007 THEIR ESSENCE IS ONE AND THE SAME THERE IS NO DENYING IT NOW DOST THOU KNOW SAID SHE THAT ALL WHICH IS ABIDES AND SUBSISTS SO LONG AS IT CONTINUES ONE BUT SO SOON AS IT CEASES TO BE ONE IT PERISHES
157-121899-0008 AND FALLS TO PIECES IN WHAT WAY WHY TAKE ANIMALS FOR EXAMPLE
157-121899-0009 THIS IS WE SAY A LIVING CREATURE BUT WHEN THIS UNITY IS BROKEN BY THE SEPARATION OF THESE TWO THE CREATURE DIES AND IS CLEARLY NO LONGER LIVING
157-121899-0010 OF ITS MEMBERS PRESENTS A HUMAN APPEARANCE BUT IF THE SEPARATION AND DISPERSAL OF THE PARTS BREAK UP THE BODY'S UNITY IT CEASES TO BE WHAT IT WAS AND IF WE EXTEND OUR SURVEY TO ALL OTHER THINGS WITHOUT DOUBT IT WILL MANIFESTLY APPEAR
157-121899-0011 WELL IS THERE AUGHT SAID SHE WHICH IN SO FAR AS IT ACTS CONFORMABLY TO NATURE ABANDONS THE WISH FOR LIFE AND DESIRES TO COME TO DEATH AND CORRUPTION
157-121899-0012 I FIND NONE THAT WITHOUT EXTERNAL COMPULSION FOREGO THE WILL TO LIVE AND OF THEIR OWN ACCORD HASTEN TO DESTRUCTION FOR EVERY CREATURE DILIGENTLY PURSUES THE END OF SELF PRESERVATION AND SHUNS DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
157-121899-0013 AS TO HERBS AND TREES AND INANIMATE THINGS GENERALLY I AM ALTOGETHER IN DOUBT WHAT TO THINK AND YET THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF QUESTION ABOUT THIS EITHER SINCE THOU SEEST HOW HERBS AND TREES GROW IN PLACES SUITABLE FOR THEM
157-121899-0014 THEY CANNOT QUICKLY WITHER AND DIE SOME SPRING UP IN THE PLAINS OTHERS IN THE MOUNTAINS SOME GROW IN MARSHES OTHERS CLING TO ROCKS AND OTHERS AGAIN FIND A FERTILE SOIL IN THE BARREN SANDS
157-121899-0015 AND IF YOU TRY TO TRANSPLANT THESE ELSEWHERE THEY WITHER AWAY NATURE GIVES TO EACH THE SOIL THAT SUITS IT AND USES HER DILIGENCE TO PREVENT ANY OF THEM DYING SO LONG AS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE ALIVE
157-121899-0016 WHY DO THEY ALL DRAW THEIR NOURISHMENT FROM ROOTS AS FROM A MOUTH DIPPED INTO THE EARTH AND DISTRIBUTE THE STRONG BARK OVER THE PITH WHY ARE ALL THE SOFTER PARTS LIKE THE PITH DEEPLY ENCASED WITHIN
157-121899-0017 WHILE THE EXTERNAL PARTS HAVE THE STRONG TEXTURE OF WOOD AND OUTSIDE OF ALL IS THE BARK TO RESIST THE WEATHER'S INCLEMENCY LIKE A CHAMPION STOUT IN ENDURANCE AGAIN
157-121899-0018 HOW GREAT IS NATURE'S DILIGENCE TO SECURE UNIVERSAL PROPAGATION BY MULTIPLYING SEED WHO DOES NOT KNOW ALL THESE TO BE CONTRIVANCES NOT ONLY FOR THE PRESENT MAINTENANCE OF A SPECIES BUT FOR ITS LASTING CONTINUANCE
157-121899-0019 GENERATION AFTER GENERATION FOR EVER AND DO NOT ALSO THE THINGS BELIEVED INANIMATE ON LIKE GROUNDS OF REASON SEEK EACH WHAT IS PROPER TO ITSELF WHY DO THE FLAMES SHOOT LIGHTLY UPWARD
157-121899-0020 WHILE THE EARTH PRESSES DOWNWARD WITH ITS WEIGHT IF IT IS NOT THAT THESE MOTIONS AND SITUATIONS ARE SUITABLE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES MOREOVER EACH SEVERAL THING IS PRESERVED BY THAT WHICH IS AGREEABLE TO ITS NATURE
157-121899-0021 EVEN AS IT IS DESTROYED BY THINGS INIMICAL THINGS SOLID LIKE STONES RESIST DISINTEGRATION BY THE CLOSE ADHESION OF THEIR PARTS THINGS FLUID LIKE AIR AND WATER YIELD EASILY TO WHAT DIVIDES THEM
157-121899-0022 BUT SWIFTLY FLOW BACK AND MINGLE WITH THOSE PARTS FROM WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SEVERED WHILE FIRE AGAIN REFUSES TO BE CUT AT ALL
157-121899-0023 OF AN INTELLIGENT SOUL BUT OF THE DRIFT OF NATURE
157-121899-0024 AND DRAW OUR BREATH UNCONSCIOUSLY IN SLEEP NAY EVEN IN LIVING CREATURES THE LOVE OF LIFE COMETH NOT OF CONSCIOUS WILL
157-121899-0025 FOR OFTENTIMES IN THE STRESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CHOOSES THE DEATH WHICH NATURE SHRINKS FROM AND CONTRARILY IN SPITE OF NATURAL APPETITE
157-121899-0026 WILL RESTRAINS THAT WORK OF REPRODUCTION BY WHICH ALONE THE PERSISTENCE OF PERISHABLE CREATURES IS MAINTAINED SO ENTIRELY DOES THIS LOVE OF SELF COME FROM DRIFT OF NATURE NOT FROM ANIMAL IMPULSE
157-121899-0027 PROVIDENCE HAS FURNISHED THINGS WITH THIS MOST COGENT REASON FOR CONTINUANCE THEY MUST DESIRE LIFE SO LONG AS IT IS NATURALLY POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE LIVING WHEREFORE IN NO WAY MAYST THOU DOUBT
157-121899-0028 BUT THAT THINGS NATURALLY AIM AT CONTINUANCE OF EXISTENCE AND SHUN DESTRUCTION I CONFESS SAID I THAT WHAT I LATELY THOUGHT UNCERTAIN I NOW PERCEIVE TO BE INDUBITABLY CLEAR
157-121899-0029 NOW THAT WHICH SEEKS TO SUBSIST AND CONTINUE DESIRES TO BE ONE FOR IF ITS ONENESS BE GONE ITS VERY EXISTENCE CANNOT CONTINUE TRUE SAID I ALL THINGS THEN DESIRE TO BE ONE I AGREE
157-121899-0030 BUT WE HAVE PROVED THAT ONE IS THE VERY SAME THING AS GOOD WE HAVE ALL THINGS THEN SEEK THE GOOD INDEED YOU MAY EXPRESS THE FACT BY DEFINING GOOD AS THAT WHICH ALL DESIRE
157-121899-0031 NOTHING COULD BE MORE TRULY THOUGHT OUT EITHER THERE IS NO SINGLE END TO WHICH ALL THINGS ARE RELATIVE OR ELSE THE END TO WHICH ALL THINGS UNIVERSALLY HASTEN MUST BE THE HIGHEST GOOD OF ALL THEN SHE
157-121899-0032 EXCEEDINGLY DO I REJOICE DEAR PUPIL THINE EYE IS NOW FIXED ON THE VERY CENTRAL MARK OF TRUTH MOREOVER HEREIN IS REVEALED THAT OF WHICH THOU DIDST ERSTWHILE PROFESS THYSELF IGNORANT WHAT IS THAT SAID I
157-121899-0033 SURELY IT IS THAT WHICH IS DESIRED OF ALL AND SINCE WE HAVE CONCLUDED THE GOOD TO BE SUCH WE OUGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE END AND AIM OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE TO BE THE GOOD
157-121899-0034 WHO FROM FALSE WAYS HIS HEEDFUL STEPS WOULD KEEP BY INWARD LIGHT MUST SEARCH WITHIN IN MEDITATION DEEP ALL OUTWARD BENT HE MUST REPRESS HIS SOUL'S TRUE TREASURE TO POSSESS
157-121899-0035 THEN ALL THAT ERROR'S MISTS OBSCURED SHALL SHINE MORE CLEAR THAN LIGHT THIS FLESHLY FRAME'S OBLIVIOUS WEIGHT HATH QUENCHED NOT REASON QUITE THE GERMS OF TRUTH STILL LIE WITHIN WHENCE WE BY LEARNING
157-121899-0036 ALL MAY WIN ELSE HOW COULD YE THE ANSWER DUE
157-121899-0037 WERE'T NOT THAT DEEP WITHIN THE SOUL TRUTH'S SECRET SPARKS DO LIVE IF PLATO'S TEACHING ERRETH NOT WE LEARN
