2294-161714-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THEY MUST HAVE CARRIED ME
2294-161714-0001 FOR WHEN I WOKE THE FOLLOWING MORNING MY SURROUNDINGS WERE FAMILIAR ENOUGH THOUGH A GLORIOUS MAZE OF UNCERTAINTIES ROCKED TO AND FRO IN MY MIND
2294-161714-0002 WAS HERU REAL OR ONLY A LOVELY FANCY AND THOSE HAIRY RUFFIANS OF WHOM A HORRIBLE VISION DANCED BEFORE MY WAKING EYES WERE THEY FANCY TOO NO
2294-161714-0003 MY WRISTS STILL ACHED WITH THE STRAIN OF THE TUSSLE THE QUAINT SAD WINE TASTE WAS STILL ON MY LIPS IT WAS ALL REAL ENOUGH I DECIDED STARTING UP IN BED AND IF IT WAS REAL WHERE WAS THE LITTLE PRINCESS WHAT HAD THEY DONE WITH HER SURELY THEY HAD NOT GIVEN HER TO THE APE MEN
2294-161714-0004 AND SHE SHRINKING FROM THEM IN HORROR WHILE HER POOR WHITE FACE TURNED TO ME FOR RESCUE IN DESPERATE PLEADING OH I MUST FIND HER AT ALL COSTS AND LEAPING FROM BED I SNATCHED UP THOSE TROUSERS WITHOUT WHICH THE BEST OF HEROES IS NOTHING
2294-161714-0005 WITH HALF A DOZEN OTHERS BEHIND HIM SWEPT ASIDE THE CURTAINS OF MY DOORWAY THEY PEEPED AND PEERED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM THEN ONE SAID IS PRINCESS HERU WITH YOU SIR NO I ANSWERED ROUGHLY SAINTS ALIVE MAN
2294-161714-0006 WHOM WE SAW CARRIED DOWN TO THE HARBOUR AT DAYBREAK BY YONDER WOODMEN AND THE PINK UPON THEIR PRETTY CHEEKS FADED TO NOTHING AT THE SUGGESTION WHAT I ROARED HERU TAKEN FROM THE PALACE BY A HANDFUL OF MEN AND NONE OF YOU INFERNAL RASCALS
2294-161714-0007 NONE OF YOU WHITE LIVERED ABORTIONS LIFTED A HAND TO SAVE HER CURSE ON YOU A THOUSAND TIMES OUT OF MY WAY YOU CHURLS AND SNATCHING UP COAT AND HAT AND SWORD I RUSHED FURIOUSLY DOWN THE LONG MARBLE STAIRS JUST AS THE SHORT MARTIAN NIGHT WAS GIVING PLACE TO LAVENDER COLOURED LIGHT OF MORNING
2294-161714-0008 I FOUND MY WAY SOMEHOW DOWN THE DESERTED CORRIDORS WHERE THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH AROMATIC VAPOURS I FLEW BY CURTAINED NICHES AND CHAMBERS WHERE AMONGST MOUNDS OF HALF WITHERED FLOWERS THE MARTIAN LOVERS WERE SLOWLY WAKING DOWN INTO THE BANQUETHALL I SPED
2294-161714-0009 AND THERE IN THE TWILIGHT WAS THE LITTER OF THE FEAST STILL ABOUT GOLD CUPS AND SILVER BROKEN BREAD AND MEAT THE CONVOLVULUS FLOWERS ALL TURNING THEIR PALLID FACES TO THE ROSY DAYLIGHT MAKING POOLS OF BRIGHTNESS BETWEEN THE SHADOWS
2294-161714-0010 AMONGST THE LITTER LITTLE SAPPHIRE COLOURED FINCHES WERE FEEDING TWITTERING MERRILY TO THEMSELVES AS THEY HOPPED ABOUT AND HERE AND THERE DOWN THE LONG TABLES LAY ASPRAWL A BELATED REVELLER HIS EMPTY OBLIVION PHIAL BEFORE HIM HIS CURLY HEAD UPON HIS ARMS DREAMING PERHAPS OF LAST NIGHT'S FEAST
2294-161714-0011 AND A NEGLECTED BRIDE DOZING DISPASSIONATE IN SOME DISTANT CHAMBER BUT HERU WAS NOT THERE AND LITTLE I CARED FOR TWITTERING FINCHES OR SIGHING DAMSELS WITH HASTY FEET I RUSHED DOWN THE HALL OUT INTO THE COOL SWEET AIR OF THE PLANET MORNING
2294-161714-0012 THERE I MET ONE WHOM I KNEW AND HE TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN AMONG THE CROWD AND HAD HEARD THE WOODMEN HAD GONE NO FARTHER THAN THE RIVER GATE THAT HERU WAS WITH THEM BEYOND A DOUBT I WOULD NOT LISTEN TO MORE GOOD I SHOUTED
2294-161714-0013 GET ME A HORSE AND JUST A HANDFUL OF YOUR SLEEK KINDRED AND WE WILL PULL THE PRIZE FROM THE BEAR'S PAW EVEN YET SURELY I SAID TURNING TO A KNOT OF MARTIAN YOUTHS WHO STOOD LISTENING A FEW STEPS AWAY
2294-161714-0014 THE BIG BULLIES ARE VERY FEW THE SEA RUNS BEHIND THEM THE MAID IN THEIR CLUTCH IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR IT NEEDS BUT ONE GOOD ONSET FIVE MINUTES GALLANTRY AND SHE IS OURS AGAIN
2294-161714-0015 THINK HOW FINE IT WILL LOOK TO BRING HER BACK BEFORE YON SLEEPY FELLOWS HAVE FOUND THEIR WEAPONS YOU THERE WITH THE BLUE TUNIC YOU LOOK A PROPER FELLOW AND SOMETHING OF A HEART SHOULD BEAT UNDER SUCH GAY WRAPPINGS WILL YOU COME WITH ME BUT BLUE MANTLE BITING HIS THUMBS
2294-161714-0016 MURMURED HE HAD NOT BREAKFASTED YET AND EDGED AWAY BEHIND HIS COMPANIONS WHEREVER I LOOKED EYES DROPPED AND TIMID HANDS FIDGETED AS THEIR OWNERS BACKED OFF FROM MY DANGEROUS ENTHUSIASM THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY NO HELP TO BE HAD FROM THEM AND MEANTIME THE PRECIOUS MOMENTS WERE FLYING
2294-161714-0017 SO WITH A DISDAINFUL GLANCE I TURNED ON MY HEELS AND SET OFF ALONE AS HARD AS I COULD GO FOR THE HARBOUR BUT IT WAS TOO LATE I RUSHED THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE WHERE ALL WAS SILENT AND DESERTED I RAN ON TO THE WHARVES BEYOND AND THEY WERE EMPTY SAVE FOR THE LITTER AND EMBERS OF THE FIRES AR HAP'S MEN HAD MADE DURING THEIR STAY
2294-161714-0018 TWO BOATLOADS OF THEM TWENTY YARDS FROM SHORE
2294-161714-0019 THIS LATTER WAS CAREENING OVER AS A DUSKY GROUP OF MEN LIFTED ABOARD TO A HEAP OF TUMBLED SILKS AND STUFFS IN THE STERN SUCH A SWEET PIECE OF INSENSIBLE MERCHANDISE AS NO MAN I AT LEAST OF ALL COULD MISTAKE IT WAS HERU HERSELF AND THE ROGUES WERE LADLING HER ON BOARD LIKE SO MUCH SANDAL WOOD OR COTTON SHEETING
2294-161714-0020 I DID NOT WAIT FOR MORE BUT OUT CAME MY SWORD AND YIELDING TO A RECKLESS IMPULSE FOR WHICH PERHAPS LAST NIGHT'S WINE WAS AS MUCH TO BLAME AS ANYTHING I SPRANG DOWN THE STEPS AND LEAPT ABOARD OF THE BOAT JUST AS IT WAS PUSHED OFF UPON THE SWIFT TIDE
2294-161714-0021 FULL OF BERSARK RAGE I CUT ONE BRAWNY COPPER COLOURED THIEF DOWN AND STRUCK ANOTHER WITH MY FIST BETWEEN THE EYES SO THAT HE WENT HEADLONG INTO THE WATER SINKING LIKE LEAD AND DEEP INTO THE GREAT TARGET OF HIS NEIGHBOUR'S CHEST I DROVE MY BLADE HAD THERE BEEN A MAN BESIDE ME
2294-161714-0022 HAD THERE BEEN BUT TWO OR THREE OF ALL THOSE SILKEN TRIFLERS TOO LATE COME ON THE TERRACES ABOVE TO WATCH WE MIGHT HAVE WON BUT ALL ALONE WHAT COULD I DO THAT LAST RED BEAST TURNED ON MY BLADE AND AS HE FELL DRAGGED ME HALF DOWN WITH HIM I STAGGERED UP
2294-161714-0023 AND TUGGING THE METAL FROM HIM TURNED ON THE NEXT AT THAT MOMENT THE CAUSE OF ALL THE TURMOIL ROUSED BY THE FIGHTING CAME TO HERSELF AND SITTING UP ON THE PILED PLUNDER IN THE BOAT STARED ROUND FOR A MOMENT WITH A CHILDISH HORROR AT THE BARBARIANS WHOSE PRIZE SHE WAS THEN AT ME
2294-161714-0024 THEN AT THE DEAD MAN AT MY FEET WHOSE BLOOD WAS WELLING IN A RED TIDE FROM THE WOUND IN HIS BREAST AS THE FULL MEANING OF THE SCENE DAWNED UPON HER SHE STARTED TO HER FEET LOOKING WONDERFULLY BEAUTIFUL AMONGST THOSE DUSKY FORMS AND EXTENDING HER HANDS TO ME BEGAN TO CRY IN THE MOST PITEOUS WAY
2294-161714-0025 I SPRANG FORWARD AND AS I DID SO SAW AN APE MAN CLAP HIS HAIRY PAW OVER HER MOUTH AND FACE
2294-161714-0026 AND DRAG HER ROUGHLY BACK BUT THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST I REMEMBERED AS I TURNED TO HIT HIM STANDING ON THE SLIPPERY THWART ANOTHER ROGUE CREPT UP BEHIND AND LET DRIVE WITH A CLUB HE HAD IN HAND THE CUDGEL CAUGHT ME SIDEWAYS ON THE HEAD A GLANCING SHOT I CAN RECALL A BLAZE OF LIGHT
2294-161714-0027 A STRANGE MEDLEY OF SOUNDS IN MY EARS AND THEN CLUTCHING AT A PILE OF STUFFS AS I FELL A TALL BOWER OF SPRAY RISING ON EITHER HAND AND THE COOL SHOCK OF THE BLUE SEA AS I PLUNGED HEADLONG IN BUT NOTHING AFTER THAT HOW LONG AFTER I KNOW NOT
2294-161714-0028 BUT PRESENTLY A TISSUE OF DAYLIGHT CREPT INTO MY EYES AND I AWOKE AGAIN IT WAS BETTER THAN NOTHING PERHAPS YET IT WAS A POOR AWAKENING THE BIG SUN LAY LOW DOWN AND THE DAY WAS ALL BUT DONE SO MUCH I GUESSED AS I ROCKED IN THAT LIGHT WITH AN UNDULATING MOVEMENT
2294-161714-0029 RECOGNISED WITH A START OF WONDER THAT I WAS STILL IN THE WATER FLOATING ON A SWIFT CURRENT INTO THE UNKNOWN ON AN AIR FILLED PILE OF SILKEN STUFFS WHICH HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN WITH ME FROM THE BOAT WHEN I GOT MY GANGING FROM YONDER RASCAL'S MACE IT WAS A WET COUCH SODDEN AND CHILLY
2294-161714-0030 BUT AS THE FRESHENING EVENING WIND BLEW ON MY FACE AND THE DARKENING WATER LAPPED AGAINST MY FOREHEAD I REVIVED MORE FULLY WHERE HAD WE COME TO I TURNED AN ACHING NECK AND ALL ALONG ON BOTH SIDES SEEMED TO STRETCH STEEP STRAIGHT COASTS ABOUT A MILE OR SO APART
2294-161714-0031 IN THE SHADOW OF THE SETTING SUN BLACK AS EBONY BETWEEN THE TWO THE HAMPERED WATER RAN QUICKLY WITH AWAY ON THE RIGHT SOME SHALLOW SANDY SPITS AND ISLANDS COVERED WITH DWARF BUSHES CHILLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLACES THEY SEEMED AS I TURNED MY EYES UPON THEM
2294-161714-0032 BUT HE WHO RIDES HELPLESS DOWN AN EVENING TIDE STANDS OUT FOR NO GREAT NICETIES OF LANDING PLACE COULD I BUT REACH THEM THEY WOULD MAKE AT LEAST A DRIER BED THAN THIS OF MINE
2294-161714-0033 THE SINEWS OF MY NECK AND FOREARMS A MASS OF AGONIES AND NO MORE FIT TO SWIM ME TO THOSE REEDY SWAMPS WHICH NOW AS PAIN AND HUNGER BEGAN TO TELL SEEMED TO WEAR THE ASPECTS OF PARADISE WITH A GROAN I DROPPED BACK UPON MY RAFT AND WATCHED THE ISLANDS SLIPPING BY
2294-161714-0034 WHILE OVER MY FEET THE SOUTHERN SKY DARKENED TO PURPLE THERE WAS NO HELP THERE BUT GLANCING ROUND AWAY ON THE LEFT AND A FEW FURLONGS FROM ME I NOTICED ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER TWO CONVERGING STRANDS OF BRIGHTNESS
2294-161714-0035 A HEAD PRESENTLY DEVELOPED THEN AS WE APPROACHED THE EARS AND ANTLERS OF A SWIMMING STAG IT WAS A HUGE BEAST AS IT LOOMED UP AGAINST THE GLOW BIGGER THAN ANY MORTAL STAG EVER WAS THE KIND OF FELLOW TRAVELLER NO ONE WOULD WILLINGLY ACCOST
2294-161714-0036 WHEN WE WERE ABOUT A FURLONG APART THE GREAT BEAST SEEMED TO CHANGE ITS COURSE MAYHAP IT TOOK THE WRECKAGE ON WHICH I FLOATED FOR AN OUTLYING SHOAL
2294-161714-0037 BE THIS AS IT MAY THE BEAST CAME HURTLING DOWN ON ME LIP DEEP IN THE WAVES A MIGHTY BROWN HEAD WITH PRICKED EARS THAT FLICKED THE WATER FROM THEM NOW AND THEN SMALL BRIGHT EYES SET FAR BACK AND WIDE PALMATED ANTLERS ON A MIGHTY FOREHEAD LIKE THE DEAD BRANCHES OF A TREE
2294-161714-0038 WHAT THAT MARTIAN MOUNTAIN ELK HAD HOPED FOR CAN ONLY BE GUESSED WHAT HE MET WITH WAS A TANGLE OF FLOATING FINERY CARRYING A NUMBED TRAVELLER ON IT AND WITH A SNORT OF DISAPPOINTMENT HE TURNED AGAIN IT WAS A POOR CHANCE BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING
2294-161714-0039 QUICK AS THOUGHT THE BEAST TWISTED HIS HEAD ASIDE AND TOSSED HIS ANTLERS SO THAT THE TRY WAS FRUITLESS BUT WAS I TO LOSE MY ONLY CHANCE OF SHORE WITH ALL MY STRENGTH I HURLED MYSELF UPON HIM MISSING MY CLUTCH AGAIN BY A HAIR'S BREADTH
2294-161714-0040 AND GOING HEADLONG INTO THE SALT FURROW HIS CHEST WAS TURNING UP HAPPILY I KEPT HOLD OF THE WEB FOR THE GREAT ELK THEN TURNED BACK PASSING BETWEEN ME AND THE RUCK OF STUFF AND GETTING THEREBY THE SILK UNDER HIS CHIN AND AS I CAME GASPING TO THE TOP ONCE MORE
2294-161714-0041 ROUND CAME THAT DAINTY WRECKAGE OVER HIS BACK AND I CLUTCHED IT AND SOONER THAN IT TAKES TO TELL I WAS TOWING TO THE SHORE AS PERHAPS NO ONE WAS EVER TOWED BEFORE THE BIG BEAST DRAGGED THE RUCK LIKE WITHERED WEED BEHIND HIM BELLOWING ALL THE TIME WITH A VOICE WHICH MADE THE HILLS ECHO ALL ROUND
2294-161714-0042 AND THEN WHEN HE GOT HIS FEET UPON THE SHALLOWS ROSE DRIPPING AND MOUNTAINOUS A VERY CLIFF OF BLACK HIDE AND LIMB AGAINST THE NIGHT SHINE AND WITH A SINGLE SWEEP OF HIS ANTLERS TORE THE WEBBING FROM ME WHO LAY PRONE AND BREATHLESS IN THE MUD AND THINKING IT WAS HIS ENEMY HURLED THE LIMP BUNDLE ON THE BEACH
