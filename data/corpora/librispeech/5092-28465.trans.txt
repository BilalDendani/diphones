5092-28465-0000 NEXT DAY I PLANNED AN EXCURSION TO THE SO CALLED DIRT GLACIER THE MOST INTERESTING TO INDIANS AND STEAMER MEN OF ALL THE STICKEEN GLACIERS FROM ITS MYSTERIOUS FLOODS I LEFT THE STEAMER GERTRUDE FOR THE GLACIER DELTA AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE SUNSET
5092-28465-0001 THE CAPTAIN KINDLY LOANED ME HIS CANOE AND TWO OF HIS INDIAN DECK HANDS WHO SEEMED MUCH PUZZLED TO KNOW WHAT THE RARE SERVICE REQUIRED OF THEM MIGHT MEAN AND ON LEAVING BADE A MERRY ADIEU TO THEIR COMPANIONS WE CAMPED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE RIVER OPPOSITE
5092-28465-0002 I HAD MY SUPPER BEFORE LEAVING THE STEAMER SO I HAD ONLY TO MAKE A CAMPFIRE SPREAD MY BLANKET AND LIE DOWN THE INDIANS HAD THEIR OWN BEDDING AND LAY BESIDE THEIR OWN FIRE
5092-28465-0003 USUALLY IN THE LATE SUMMER THE DELTA OF THIS GLACIER STREAM IS THREE OR FOUR MILES WIDE WHERE IT FRONTS THE RIVER AND THE MANY ROUGH CHANNELS WITH WHICH IT IS GUTTERED AND THE
5092-28465-0004 UPROOTED TREES AND HUGE BOULDERS THAT ROUGHEN ITS SURFACE MANIFEST THE POWER OF THE FLOODS THAT SWEPT THEM TO THEIR PLACES BUT UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS THE GLACIER DISCHARGES ITS DRAINAGE WATER INTO THE RIVER
5092-28465-0005 THROUGH ONLY FOUR OR FIVE OF THE DELTA CHANNELS OUR CAMP WAS MADE ON THE SOUTH OR LOWER SIDE OF THE DELTA BELOW ALL THE DRAINING STREAMS SO THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TO FORD ANY OF THEM ON MY WAY TO THE GLACIER THE INDIANS CHOSE A SAND PIT TO SLEEP IN
5092-28465-0006 I CHOSE A LEVEL SPOT BACK OF A DRIFT LOG I HAD BUT LITTLE TO SAY TO MY COMPANIONS AS THEY COULD SPEAK NO ENGLISH NOR I MUCH THLINKIT OR CHINOOK IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER LANDING THEY RETIRED TO THEIR PIT AND WERE SOON ASLEEP AND ASNORE
5092-28465-0007 THAN BY DAY AND TO BE LOOKING DOWN LIKE GUARDIANS OF THE VALLEY WHILE THE WATERFALLS AND THE TORRENTS ESCAPING FROM BENEATH THE BIG GLACIER ROARED IN A BROAD LOW MONOTONE SOUNDING AS IF CLOSE AT HAND THOUGH
5092-28465-0008 AS IT PROVED NEXT DAY THE NEAREST WAS THREE MILES AWAY AFTER WRAPPING MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS I STILL GAZED INTO THE MARVELOUS SKY AND MADE OUT TO SLEEP ONLY ABOUT TWO HOURS THEN WITHOUT WAKING THE NOISY SLEEPERS I AROSE
5092-28465-0009 FOLLOWING A DRY CHANNEL FOR ABOUT A MILE
5092-28465-0010 WHICH IN THE IMPERFECT LIGHT SEEMED AS LARGE AS THE RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET WIDE AND PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR FEET DEEP A LITTLE FARTHER UP IT WAS ONLY ABOUT FIFTY FEET WIDE AND RUSHING ON WITH IMPETUOUS ROARING FORCE IN ITS ROCKY CHANNEL
5092-28465-0011 SWEEPING FORWARD SAND GRAVEL COBBLESTONES AND BOULDERS THE BUMP AND RUMBLE SOUNDS OF THE LARGEST OF THESE ROLLING STONES BEING READILY HEARD IN THE MIDST OF THE ROARING IT WAS TOO SWIFT AND ROUGH TO FORD AND NO BRIDGE TREE COULD BE FOUND
5092-28465-0012 HORRIDUM MAKING A JUNGLE ALL BUT IMPENETRABLE
5092-28465-0013 WILL NOT SOON BE FORGOTTEN AT LENGTH ARRIVING WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF THE GLACIER FULL OF PANAX BARBS I FOUND THAT BOTH THE GLACIER AND ITS UNFORDABLE STREAM WERE PRESSING HARD AGAINST A SHELVING CLIFF DANGEROUSLY STEEP
5092-28465-0014 BUT BY SUNRISE ALL THESE CLIFF JUNGLE AND TORRENT TROUBLES WERE OVERCOME AND I GLADLY FOUND MYSELF FREE ON THE MAGNIFICENT ICE RIVER THE CURVING
5092-28465-0015 TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND ITS SURFACE FOR A MILE OR SO ABOVE THE FRONT IS STREWN WITH MORAINE DETRITUS GIVING IT A STRANGELY DIRTY DUSKY LOOK HENCE ITS NAME THE DIRT GLACIER
5092-28465-0016 A MILE OR TWO BEYOND THE MORAINE COVERED PART I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND ALPINE PLANTS GROWING ON THE ICE FRESH AND GREEN SOME OF THEM IN FULL FLOWER THESE CURIOUS GLACIER GARDENS THE FIRST I HAD SEEN WERE EVIDENTLY PLANTED BY SNOW AVALANCHES FROM THE HIGH WALLS
5092-28465-0017 AND IN SOME PLACES FORMED BEDS OF CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS SEEDLING TREES AND BUSHES ALSO WERE GROWING AMONG THE FLOWERS ADMIRING THESE NOVEL FLOATING GARDENS I STRUCK OUT FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE PURE WHITE GLACIER WHERE THE ICE SEEMED SMOOTHER
5092-28465-0018 AND THEN HELD STRAIGHT ON FOR ABOUT EIGHT MILES WHERE I RELUCTANTLY TURNED BACK TO MEET THE STEAMER GREATLY REGRETTING THAT I HAD NOT BROUGHT A WEEK'S SUPPLY OF HARDTACK TO ALLOW ME TO EXPLORE THE GLACIER TO ITS HEAD
5092-28465-0019 AND THEN TRUST TO SOME PASSING CANOE TO TAKE ME DOWN TO BUCK STATION FROM WHICH I COULD EXPLORE THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER ALTOGETHER I SAW ABOUT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN MILES OF THE MAIN TRUNK THE GRADE IS ALMOST REGULAR
5092-28465-0020 AND THE WALLS ON EITHER HAND ARE ABOUT FROM TWO TO THREE THOUSAND FEET HIGH SCULPTURED LIKE THOSE OF YOSEMITE VALLEY
5092-28465-0021 FORMING A DAM WHICH GIVES RISE TO A LAKE ON THE HEAD OF THE DETACHED TRIBUTARY THERE ARE SOME FIVE OR SIX SMALL RESIDUAL GLACIERS THE DRAINAGE OF WHICH WITH THAT OF THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN SLOPES ABOVE THEM DISCHARGES INTO THE LAKE
5092-28465-0022 WHOSE OUTLET IS THROUGH A CHANNEL OR CHANNELS BENEATH THE DAMMING GLACIER NOW THESE SUB CHANNELS ARE OCCASIONALLY BLOCKED AND THE WATER RISES UNTIL IT FLOWS ALONGSIDE OF THE GLACIER BUT AS THE DAM IS A MOVING ONE
5092-28465-0023 A GRAND OUTBURST IS SOMETIMES MADE WHICH DRAINING THE LARGE LAKE PRODUCES A FLOOD OF AMAZING POWER SWEEPING DOWN IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF MORAINE MATERIAL AND RAISING THE RIVER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ITS MOUTH
5092-28465-0024 LARGE AND SMALL GLIDING SWIRLING WITH WONDERFUL GRACE OF MOTION IN THEIR FRICTIONLESS CHANNELS CALLING FORTH DEVOUT ADMIRATION AT
5092-28465-0025 LOOKING AHEAD FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE GLACIER YOU SEE THE BROAD WHITE FLOOD THOUGH APPARENTLY RIGID AS IRON SWEEPING IN GRACEFUL CURVES BETWEEN ITS HIGH MOUNTAIN LIKE WALLS SMALL GLACIERS HANGING IN THE HOLLOWS ON EITHER SIDE
5092-28465-0026 AND SNOW IN EVERY FORM ABOVE THEM AND THE GREAT DOWN PLUNGING GRANITE BUTTRESSES AND HEADLANDS OF THE WALLS MARVELOUS IN BOLD MASSIVE SCULPTURE FORESTS IN SIDE CANYONS TO WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF THE GLACIER AVALANCHE PATHWAYS OVERGROWN WITH ALDER AND WILLOW
5092-28465-0027 INNUMERABLE CASCADES KEEPING UP A SOLEMN HARMONY OF WATER SOUNDS BLENDING WITH THOSE OF THE GLACIER MOULINS AND RILLS AND AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN REACH TRIBUTARY GLACIERS AT SHORT INTERVALS SILENTLY DESCENDING FROM THEIR HIGH
5092-28465-0028 WHITE FOUNTAINS TO SWELL THE GRAND CENTRAL ICE RIVER IN THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE MAIN GLACIER AND THE LAKE THAT GIVES RISE TO THE RIVER FLOODS THERE IS A MASSIVE GRANITE DOME SPARSELY FEATHERED WITH TREES
5092-28465-0029 AND THE PEAK WERE FLUSHED IN THE ALPENGLOW A MILE OR TWO ABOVE THIS MOUNTAIN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE GLACIER THERE IS A ROCK LIKE THE YOSEMITE SENTINEL AND IN GENERAL ALL THE WALL ROCKS AS FAR AS I SAW THEM ARE MORE OR LESS
5092-28465-0030 YOSEMITIC IN FORM AND COLOR AND STREAKED WITH CASCADES BUT WONDERFUL AS THIS NOBLE ICE RIVER IS IN SIZE AND DEPTH AND IN POWER DISPLAYED FAR MORE WONDERFUL WAS THE VASTLY GREATER GLACIER THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND FEET
5092-28465-0031 OR PERHAPS A MILE IN DEPTH WHOSE SIZE AND GENERAL HISTORY IS INSCRIBED ON THE SIDES OF THE WALLS AND OVER THE TOPS OF THE ROCKS IN CHARACTERS WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN GREATLY DIMMED BY THE WEATHER
5092-28465-0032 THE INDIANS HAD GONE OFF PICKING BERRIES BUT WERE ON THE WATCH FOR ME AND HAILED ME AS I APPROACHED THE CAPTAIN HAD CALLED FOR ME AND AFTER WAITING THREE HOURS DEPARTED FOR WRANGELL WITHOUT LEAVING ANY FOOD
5092-28465-0033 HERE I REMAINED TO STUDY THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER BUT THE INDIANS SET OUT FOR WRANGELL SOON AFTER SUPPER THOUGH I INVITED THEM TO STAY TILL MORNING
5092-28465-0034 BROAD MOUNTAIN GATEWAY AND EXPANDING IN THE SPACIOUS RIVER VALLEY TO A WIDTH OF FOUR OR FIVE MILES WHILE DIM IN THE GRAY DISTANCE LOOMED ITS HIGH MOUNTAIN FOUNTAINS SO GRAND AN INVITATION DISPLAYED IN CHARACTERS SO TELLING WAS OF COURSE IRRESISTIBLE
5092-28465-0035 AND BODY CARE AND WEATHER CARE VANISHED MISTER CHOQUETTE THE KEEPER OF THE STATION FERRIED ME ACROSS THE RIVER AND I SPENT THE DAY IN GETTING GENERAL VIEWS AND PLANNING THE WORK THAT
5092-28465-0036 I FIRST TRACED THE BROAD COMPLICATED TERMINAL MORAINE TO ITS SOUTHERN EXTREMITY CLIMBED UP THE WEST SIDE ALONG THE LATERAL MORAINE THREE OR FOUR MILES MAKING MY WAY NOW ON THE GLACIER
5092-28465-0037 GLAD REJOICING STREAMS FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIDE WERE HURRYING AS IF GOING HOME
5092-28465-0038 ANY TIME I REPLIED I SHALL SEE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OF THE GLACIER AND I KNOW NOT HOW LONG IT WILL HOLD ME WELL BUT WHEN WILL I COME TO LOOK FOR YOU IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
5092-28465-0039 YEARS AGO RUSSIAN OFFICERS FROM SITKA WENT UP THE GLACIER FROM HERE AND NONE EVER RETURNED IT'S A MIGHTY DANGEROUS GLACIER ALL FULL OF DAMN DEEP HOLES AND CRACKS
5092-28465-0040 YES I HAVE I SAID
5092-28465-0041 THOUGH NONE SO BIG AS THIS ONE DO NOT LOOK FOR ME UNTIL I MAKE MY APPEARANCE ON THE RIVER BANK NEVER MIND ME
5092-28465-0042 AND SO SHOULDERING MY BUNDLE I TRUDGED OFF THROUGH THE MORAINE BOULDERS AND THICKETS MY GENERAL PLAN WAS TO TRACE THE TERMINAL MORAINE TO ITS EXTREME NORTH END PITCH MY LITTLE TENT
5092-28465-0043 ROUGHENED BY CONCENTRIC MASSES MARKING INTERRUPTIONS IN THE RECESSION OF THE GLACIER OF PERHAPS SEVERAL CENTURIES IN WHICH THE SUCCESSIVE MORAINES WERE FORMED AND SHOVED TOGETHER IN CLOSER OR WIDER ORDER
5092-28465-0044 I TRACED THE MORAINE TO ITS NORTHEASTERN EXTREMITY AND ASCENDED THE GLACIER FOR SEVERAL MILES ALONG THE LEFT MARGIN THEN CROSSED IT AT THE GRAND CATARACT AND DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE TO THE RIVER AND ALONG THE MORAINE TO THE POINT OF BEGINNING
5092-28465-0045 ON THE OLDER PORTIONS OF THIS MORAINE I DISCOVERED SEVERAL KETTLES IN PROCESS OF FORMATION AND WAS PLEASED TO FIND THAT THEY CONFORMED IN THE MOST STRIKING WAY WITH THE THEORY
5092-28465-0046 I HAD ALREADY BEEN LED TO MAKE FROM OBSERVATIONS ON THE OLD KETTLES WHICH FORM SO CURIOUS A FEATURE OF THE DRIFT COVERING WISCONSIN AND MINNESOTA AND SOME OF THE LARGER MORAINES OF THE RESIDUAL GLACIERS IN THE CALIFORNIA SIERRA
5092-28465-0047 I FOUND A PIT EIGHT OR TEN FEET DEEP WITH RAW SHIFTING SIDES COUNTERSUNK ABRUPTLY IN THE ROUGH MORAINE MATERIAL AND AT THE BOTTOM ON SLIDING DOWN BY THE AID OF A LITHE SPRUCE TREE THAT WAS BEING UNDERMINED
5092-28465-0048 THE FORMATION OF THIS KETTLE BY THE SLOW MELTING OF THE BURIED ICE BLOCK THE MORAINE MATERIAL OF COURSE WAS FALLING IN AS THE ICE MELTED AND THE SIDES MAINTAINED AN ANGLE AS STEEP AS THE MATERIAL WOULD LIE
5092-28465-0049 ALL SORTS OF THEORIES HAVE BEEN ADVANCED FOR THE FORMATION OF THESE KETTLES
5092-28465-0050 AT LEAST AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED
5092-28465-0051 LOOKING ALL THE GRANDER AND MORE STRIKING IN THE GRAY MIST WITH ALL THE REST OF THE GLACIER SHUT OUT UNTIL I CAME TO A LAKE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS WIDE AND TWO MILES LONG WITH SCORES OF SMALL BERGS FLOATING IN IT SOME AGROUND CLOSE INSHORE AGAINST THE MORAINE
5092-28465-0052 THE LIGHT PLAYING ON THEIR ANGLES AND SHIMMERING IN THEIR BLUE CAVES IN RAVISHING TONES THIS PROVED TO BE THE LARGEST OF THE SERIES OF NARROW LAKELETS THAT LIE IN SHALLOW TROUGHS BETWEEN THE MORAINE AND THE GLACIER A MINIATURE ARCTIC OCEAN ITS ICE CLIFFS
5092-28465-0053 AND ITS SMALL BERG FLOES DRIFTING IN ITS CURRENTS OR WITH THE WIND OR STRANDED HERE AND THERE ALONG ITS ROCKY MORAINE SHORE HUNDREDS OF SMALL RILLS AND GOOD SIZED STREAMS WERE FALLING INTO THE LAKE FROM THE GLACIER
5092-28465-0054 SINGING IN LOW TONES SOME OF THEM POURING IN SHEER FALLS OVER BLUE CLIFFS FROM NARROW ICE VALLEYS
5092-28465-0055 OTHERS GURGLING OUT OF ARCHED OPENINGS AT THE BASE ALL THESE WATER STREAMS WERE RIDING ON THE PARENT ICE STREAM THEIR VOICES JOINED IN ONE GRAND ANTHEM TELLING THE WONDERS OF THEIR NEAR AND FAR OFF FOUNTAINS
5092-28465-0056 THE LAKE ITSELF IS RESTING IN A BASIN OF ICE AND THE FORESTED MORAINE THOUGH SEEMINGLY CUT OFF FROM THE GLACIER AND PROBABLY MORE THAN A CENTURY OLD IS IN GREAT PART RESTING ON BURIED ICE LEFT BEHIND AS THE GLACIER RECEDED
5092-28465-0057 AND MELTING SLOWLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THE MORAINE DETRITUS
5092-28465-0058 THESE CHANGES GOING ON WITH MARVELOUS DELIBERATION UNTIL IN FULLNESS OF
5092-28465-0059 WHOLE MORAINE SETTLES DOWN UPON ITS BEDROCK FOUNDATION THE OUTLET OF THE LAKE IS A LARGE STREAM ALMOST A RIVER IN SIZE ONE OF THE MAIN DRAINING STREAMS OF THE GLACIER
5092-28465-0060 HERE I FOUND A SPRUCE TREE WHICH I FELLED FOR A BRIDGE IT REACHED ACROSS ABOUT TEN FEET OF THE TOP HOLDING IN THE BANK BRUSH BUT THE FORCE OF THE TORRENT ACTING ON THE SUBMERGED BRANCHES AND THE SLENDER END OF THE TRUNK
5092-28465-0061 FORTUNATELY I DISCOVERED ANOTHER LARGER TREE WELL SITUATED A LITTLE FARTHER DOWN WHICH I FELLED AND THOUGH A FEW FEET IN THE MIDDLE WAS SUBMERGED IT SEEMED PERFECTLY SAFE AS IT WAS NOW GETTING LATE
5092-28465-0062 I STARTED BACK TO THE LAKESIDE WHERE I HAD LEFT MY BUNDLE AND IN TRYING TO HOLD A DIRECT COURSE FOUND THE INTERLACED JUNGLE STILL MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT WAS ALONG THE BANK OF THE TORRENT FOR OVER AN HOUR I HAD TO CREEP AND STRUGGLE CLOSE TO THE ROCKY GROUND
5092-28465-0063 LIKE A FLY IN A SPIDER WEB WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO OBTAIN A SINGLE GLIMPSE OF ANY GUIDING FEATURE OF THE LANDSCAPE FINDING A LITTLE WILLOW TALLER THAN THE SURROUNDING ALDERS I CLIMBED IT CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE GLACIER FRONT TOOK A COMPASS BEARING
5092-28465-0064 AND SUNK AGAIN INTO THE DRIPPING BLINDING MAZE OF BRUSH AND AT LENGTH EMERGED ON THE LAKE SHORE SEVEN HOURS AFTER LEAVING IT ALL THIS TIME AS WET AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN SWIMMING THUS COMPLETING A TRYING DAY'S WORK
5092-28465-0065 BUT EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUSLY FRESH AND I FOUND NEW AND OLD PLANT FRIENDS AND LESSONS ON NATURE'S ALASKA MORAINE LANDSCAPE GARDENING THAT MADE EVERYTHING BRIGHT AND LIGHT IT WAS NOW NEAR DARK
5092-28465-0066 AND I MADE HASTE TO MAKE UP MY FLIMSY LITTLE TENT THE GROUND WAS DESPERATELY ROCKY I MADE OUT HOWEVER TO LEVEL DOWN A STRIP LARGE ENOUGH TO LIE ON AND BY MEANS OF SLIM ALDER STEMS BENT OVER IT AND TIED TOGETHER SOON HAD A HOME
5092-28465-0067 ROCKING AND WALLOWING IN THE WAVES IT HAD RAISED AS IF ENJOYING ITS FREEDOM AFTER ITS LONG GRINDING WORK AS PART OF THE GLACIER AFTER THIS FINE LAST LESSON I MANAGED TO MAKE A SMALL FIRE OUT OF WET TWIGS GOT A CUP OF TEA
5092-28465-0068 STRIPPED OFF MY DRIPPING CLOTHING WRAPPED MYSELF IN A BLANKET AND LAY BROODING ON THE GAINS OF THE DAY AND PLANS FOR THE MORROW GLAD RICH AND ALMOST COMFORTABLE IT WAS RAINING HARD WHEN I AWOKE
5092-28465-0069 BUT I MADE UP MY MIND TO DISREGARD THE WEATHER
5092-28465-0070 ATE BISCUITS AND A PIECE OF DRIED SALMON WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A TEA FIRE FILLED A BAG WITH HARDTACK SLUNG IT OVER MY SHOULDER AND WITH MY INDISPENSABLE ICE AXE PLUNGED ONCE MORE INTO THE DRIPPING JUNGLE
5092-28465-0071 I FOUND MY BRIDGE HOLDING BRAVELY IN PLACE AGAINST THE SWOLLEN TORRENT CROSSED IT AND BEAT MY WAY AROUND POOLS AND LOGS AND THROUGH TWO HOURS OF TANGLE BACK TO THE MORAINE ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE OUTLET A WET WEARY BATTLE BUT NOT WITHOUT ENJOYMENT
5092-28465-0072 MORE ESPECIALLY MARKED WERE THE FLAT LOW TONED BUMPS AND SPLASHES OF LARGE DROPS FROM THE TREES ON THE BROAD HORIZONTAL LEAVES OF ECHINOPANAX HORRIDUM LIKE THE DRUMMING OF THUNDERSHOWER DROPS ON VERATRUM AND PALM LEAVES
5092-28465-0073 WHILE THE MOSSES WERE INDESCRIBABLY BEAUTIFUL SO FRESH SO BRIGHT SO CHEERILY GREEN AND ALL SO LOW AND CALM AND SILENT
5092-28465-0074 SURELY NEVER A PARTICLE OF DUST HAS TOUCHED LEAF OR CROWN OF ALL THESE BLESSED MOSSES
5092-28465-0075 AND THE FRUIT OF THE DWARF CORNEL AND THE WET BERRIES NATURE'S PRECIOUS JEWELRY HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE
5092-28465-0076 RED AND YELLOW SALMON BERRIES WITH CLUSTERS OF SMALLER DROPS
5092-28465-0077 EVERY DROP A MIRROR WITH ALL THE LANDSCAPE IN IT A THAT AND A THAT AND TWICE AS MUCKLE'S A THAT IN THIS GLORIOUS ALASKA DAY RECALLING HOWEVER DIFFERENT GEORGE HERBERT'S SWEET DAY SO COOL SO CALM SO BRIGHT
5092-28465-0078 IN THE GARDENS AND FORESTS OF THIS WONDERFUL MORAINE ONE MIGHT SPEND A WHOLE JOYFUL LIFE
5092-28465-0079 I TRIED TO MAKE MY WAY ALONG ITS SIDE BUT FINDING THE CLIMBING TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT TOOK TO THE GLACIER AND FARED WELL
5092-28465-0080 WHEN NIGHT WAS DRAWING NIGH I SCANNED THE STEEP MOUNTAINSIDE IN SEARCH OF AN ACCESSIBLE BENCH HOWEVER NARROW WHERE A BED AND A FIRE MIGHT BE GATHERED FOR A CAMP
5092-28465-0081 ABOUT DARK GREAT WAS MY DELIGHT TO FIND A LITTLE SHELF WITH A FEW SMALL MOUNTAIN HEMLOCKS GROWING IN CLEAVAGE JOINTS PROJECTING KNOBS BELOW IT ENABLED ME TO BUILD A PLATFORM FOR A FIREPLACE AND A BED
5092-28465-0082 AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN TURNING FROM SIDE TO SIDE STEAMING AND DRYING AFTER BEING WET TWO DAYS AND A NIGHT FORTUNATELY THIS NIGHT IT DID NOT RAIN BUT IT WAS VERY COLD
5092-28465-0083 PUSHING ON NEXT DAY I CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE GLACIER BY ICE STEPS AND ALONG ITS SIDE TO THE GRAND CATARACT TWO MILES WIDE WHERE THE WHOLE MAJESTIC FLOOD OF THE GLACIER POURS LIKE A MIGHTY SURGING RIVER DOWN A STEEP DECLIVITY IN ITS CHANNEL
5092-28465-0084 AFTER GAZING A LONG TIME ON THE GLORIOUS SHOW
5092-28465-0085 INTO WHICH I CRAWLED AND ENJOYED THE NOVEL AND INSTRUCTIVE VIEW OF A GLACIER POURING OVER MY HEAD SHOWING NOT ONLY ITS GRINDING POLISHING ACTION BUT HOW IT BREAKS OFF LARGE ANGULAR BOULDER MASSES A MOST TELLING LESSON IN EARTH SCULPTURE
5092-28465-0086 CONFIRMING MANY I HAD ALREADY LEARNED IN THE GLACIER BASINS OF THE HIGH SIERRA OF CALIFORNIA I THEN CROSSED TO THE SOUTH SIDE NOTING THE FORMS OF THE HUGE BLOCKS INTO WHICH THE GLACIER WAS BROKEN IN PASSING OVER THE BROW OF THE CATARACT
5092-28465-0087 EVERYWHERE WINTER BOUND BUT THICK FORESTED HOWEVER STEEP FOR A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST FIFTEEN MILES FROM THE FRONT THE TREES HEMLOCK AND SPRUCE CLINGING TO THE ROCK BY ROOT HOLDS AMONG CLEAVAGE JOINTS
5092-28465-0088 AT HIS HOUSE I ENJOYED A REST WHILE WRITING OUT NOTES THEN EXAMINED THE SMALLER GLACIER FRONTING THE ONE I HAD BEEN EXPLORING
