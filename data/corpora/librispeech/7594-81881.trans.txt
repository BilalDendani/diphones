7594-81881-0000 DAYS IN WHICH HE WAS REDUCED
7594-81881-0001 MECHANICALLY UTTERING THE SAME FORMULAS DAYS IN WHICH THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE OF THE CAMPAIGN SWEPT HIM ALONG WITHOUT VOLITION AND DAY FOLLOWED DAY AND NOT A SIGN CAME FROM THE PRINCESS ZOBRASKA
7594-81881-0002 EITHER OF CONDONATION OR RESENTMENT IT WAS AS THOUGH SHE HAD GATHERED HER SKIRTS AROUND HER AND GONE DISDAINFULLY OUT OF HIS LIFE FOR EVER IF SPEAKING WERE TO BE DONE IT WAS FOR HER TO SPEAK
7594-81881-0003 PAUL COULD NOT PLEAD IT WAS HE WHO IN A WAY HAD CAST HER OFF IN EFFECT HE HAD ISSUED THE CHALLENGE I AM A CHILD OF THE GUTTER AN ADVENTURER MASQUERADING UNDER AN HISTORICAL NAME
7594-81881-0004 SO IN HIS CAMPAIGN HE FAILED HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN FOR HIS YOUTH HIS JOYOUSNESS HIS MAGNETISM HIS RADIANT PROMISE OF GREAT THINGS TO COME HE WENT ABOUT THE CONSTITUENCY AN ANXIOUS HAGGARD MAN
7594-81881-0005 HE LOST GROUND DAILY ON THE OTHER HAND SILAS FINN WITH HIS ENTHUSIASMS AND HIS ASPECT OF AN INSPIRED PROPHET MADE ALARMING PROGRESS HE SWEPT THE MULTITUDE
7594-81881-0006 PAUL SAVELLI THE YOUNG MAN OF THE SOCIAL MOMENT HAD AN ARMY OF HELPERS MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT MAKING SPEECHES FRIENDS ON THE UNIONIST PRESS WRITING FLAMBOYANT LEADERS
7594-81881-0007 FAIR LADIES IN AUTOMOBILES HUNTING FOR VOTERS THROUGH THE SLUMS OF HICKNEY HEATH SILAS FINN HAD SCARCELY A PERSONAL FRIEND BUT HOPE REIGNED AMONG HIS OFFICIAL SUPPORTERS
7594-81881-0008 WHEREAS DEPRESSION BEGAN TO DESCEND OVER PAUL'S BRILLIANT HOST THEY WANT STIRRING UP A BIT SAID THE CONSERVATIVE AGENT DESPONDENTLY I HEAR OLD FINN'S MEETINGS GO WITH A BANG THEY NEARLY RAISED THE ROOF OFF LAST NIGHT
7594-81881-0009 WE WANT SOME ROOF RAISING ON THIS SIDE I DO MY BEST SAID PAUL COLDLY BUT THE REPROACH CUT DEEP HE WAS A FAILURE NO NERVOUS OR INTELLECTUAL EFFORT COULD SAVE HIM NOW
7594-81881-0010 THOUGH HE SPENT HIMSELF TO THE LAST HEARTBEAT HE WAS THE SPORT OF A MOCKING WILL O THE WISP WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FOR DESTINY ONCE ON COMING OUT OF HIS HEADQUARTERS HE MET SILAS
7594-81881-0011 WHO WAS WALKING UP THE STREET WITH TWO OR THREE OF HIS COMMITTEE MEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORDINARY AMENITIES OF ENGLISH POLITICAL LIFE THE TWO CANDIDATES SHOOK HANDS AND WITHDREW A PACE OR TWO ASIDE TO CHAT FOR A WHILE
7594-81881-0012 THE SAME OLD CRY THROUGH SHEER REPETITION PAUL BEGAN ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN IT HE FELT VERY WEARY IN HIS FATHER'S EYES HE RECOGNIZED WITH A PANG
7594-81881-0013 THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF A BELIEF IN THE ALMIGHTY'S PERSONAL INTEREST HE ANSWERED WITH A TOUCH OF IRONY WHATEVER HAPPENS ONE IS NOT EASILY DISILLUSIONED THAT IS TRUE MY SON SAID SILAS
7594-81881-0014 JANE IS WELL PAUL ASKED AFTER AN INSTANT'S PAUSE BREAKING OFF THE PROFITLESS DISCUSSION VERY WELL AND BARNEY BILL HE UPBRAIDS ME BITTERLY FOR WHAT I HAVE SAID
7594-81881-0015 PAUL SMILED AT THE CURIOUSLY STILTED PHRASE TELL HIM FROM ME NOT TO DO IT MY LOVE TO THEM BOTH THEY SHOOK HANDS AGAIN AND PAUL DROVE OFF IN THE MOTOR CAR THAT HAD BEEN PLACED AT HIS DISPOSAL DURING THE ELECTION
7594-81881-0016 AND SILAS CONTINUED HIS SOBER WALK WITH HIS COMMITTEE MEN UP THE MUDDY STREET WHEREUPON PAUL CONCEIVED A SUDDEN HATRED FOR THE CAR
7594-81881-0017 IT WAS BUT THE FINAL ARTISTIC TOUCH TO THIS COMEDY OF MOCKERY OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN THE VICTIM PERHAPS GOD WAS ON HIS FATHER'S SIDE AFTER ALL ON THE SIDE OF THEM WHO HUMBLY WALKED
7594-81881-0018 AND NOT OF THEM WHO RODE IN PROUD CHARIOTS BUT HIS POLITICAL CREED HIS SOCIOLOGICAL CONVICTIONS ROSE IN PROTEST HOW COULD THE ALMIGHTY BE IN LEAGUE WITH ALL THAT WAS SUBVERSIVE OF SOCIAL ORDER
7594-81881-0019 ALL THAT WAS DESTRUCTIVE TO IMPERIAL COHESION ALL THAT WHICH INEVITABLY TENDED TO ENGLAND'S DOWNFALL HE TURNED SUDDENLY TO HIS COMPANION THE CONSERVATIVE AGENT
7594-81881-0020 THE AGENT NOT BEING VERSED IN SPECULATIONS REGARDING THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE DEITY STARED THEN DISINCLINED TO COMMIT HIMSELF TOOK REFUGE IN PLATITUDE GOD MOVES IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY MISTER SAVELLI
7594-81881-0021 THAT'S ROT SAID PAUL IF THERE'S AN ALMIGHTY HE MUST MOVE IN A COMMON SENSE WAY OTHERWISE THE WHOLE OF THIS PLANET WOULD HAVE BUSTED UP LONG AGO DO YOU THINK IT'S COMMON SENSE TO SUPPORT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT
7594-81881-0022 CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE AGENT FERVENTLY THEN IF GOD SUPPORTED IT IT WOULDN'T BE COMMON SENSE ON HIS PART IT WOULD BE MERELY MYSTERIOUS
7594-81881-0023 OUR OPPONENT UNDOUBTEDLY HAS BEEN MAKING FREE WITH THE NAME OF THE ALMIGHTY IN HIS SPEECHES AS A MATTER OF FACT HE'S RATHER CRAZY ON THE SUBJECT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A BAD MOVE TO MAKE A SPECIAL REFERENCE TO IT
7594-81881-0024 IT'S ALL DAMNED HYPOCRISY THERE'S A CHAP IN THE OLD FRENCH PLAY WHAT'S HIS NAME
7594-81881-0025 THAT'S IT WELL THERE YOU ARE THAT SPEECH OF HIS YESTERDAY NOW WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT AND WRING RELIGIOSITY AND HYPOCRISY AND TARTUFFISM OUT OF IT YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT SORT OF THING
7594-81881-0026 BUT I DON'T LIKE SAID PAUL I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT MISTER FINN IS SINCERE IN HIS CONVICTIONS BUT MY DEAR SIR WHAT DOES HIS SUPPOSED SINCERITY MATTER IN POLITICAL CONTEST
7594-81881-0027 IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIRT AND CLEANLINESS SAID PAUL BESIDES AS I TOLD YOU AT THE OUTSET MISTER FINN AND I ARE CLOSE PERSONAL FRIENDS AND I HAVE THE HIGHEST REGARD FOR HIS CHARACTER
7594-81881-0028 YOU WERE CALLED ONLY THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY THE SPOILED DARLING OF DUCHESSES BOUDOIRS IT WASN'T WITH MISTER FINN'S COGNIZANCE I'VE FOUND THAT OUT WELL SAID THE AGENT LEANING BACK IN THE LUXURIOUS LIMOUSINE
7594-81881-0029 I DON'T SEE WHY SOMEBODY WITHOUT YOUR COGNIZANCE SHOULDN'T CALL MISTER FINN THE SPOILED MINION OF THE ALMIGHTY'S ANTE CHAMBER THAT'S A DEVILISH GOOD CATCH PHRASE HE ADDED STARTING FORWARD IN THE JOY OF HIS NEWBORN EPIGRAM
7594-81881-0030 DEVILISH GOOD THE SPOILED MINION OF THE ALMIGHTY'S ANTE CHAMBER IT'LL BECOME HISTORICAL IF IT DOES SAID PAUL IT WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMMEDIATE RETIREMENT OF THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE
7594-81881-0031 DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT IT WAS PAUL'S TURN TO START FORWARD MY DEAR WILSON SAID HE IF YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE THINKS I'M A MAN TO TALK THROUGH HIS HAT
7594-81881-0032 I'LL RETIRE AT ONCE I DON'T CARE A DAMN ABOUT MYSELF NOT A LITTLE TUPPENNY DAMN WHAT THE DEVIL DOES IT MATTER TO ME WHETHER I GET INTO PARLIAMENT OR NOT NOTHING NOT A TUPPENNY DAMN
7594-81881-0033 YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT'S THE PARTY AND THE COUNTRY FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY THE WHOLE THING CAN GO TO BLAZES I'M IN EARNEST DEAD EARNEST HE CONTINUED WITH A VEHEMENCE INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO WILSON
7594-81881-0034 IF ANYBODY DOESN'T THINK SO I'LL CLEAR OUT AT ONCE HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS BUT WHILE I'M CANDIDATE EVERYTHING I SAY I MEAN I MEAN IT INTENSELY WITH ALL MY SOUL
7594-81881-0035 AND I SAY THAT IF THERE'S A SINGLE INSULTING REFERENCE TO MISTER FINN DURING THIS ELECTION YOU'LL BE UP AGAINST THE WRECK OF YOUR OWN POLITICAL CAREER THE AGENT WATCHED THE WORKINGS OF HIS CANDIDATE'S DARK CLEAR CUT FACE
7594-81881-0036 HE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS CANDIDATE AND FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO REALIZE THAT THERE WERE PRESUMABLY SANE PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT VOTE FOR HIM ON SIGHT A LINGERING MEMORY OF GRAMMAR SCHOOL DAYS FLASHED ON HIM
7594-81881-0037 WHEN HE TOLD HIS WIFE LATER OF THE CONVERSATION AND HE LIKENED PAUL TO A WRATHFUL APOLLO ANXIOUS TO APPEASE THE GOD HE SAID HUMBLY IT WAS THE MEREST OF SUGGESTIONS MISTER SAVELLI
7594-81881-0038 HEAVEN KNOWS WE DON'T WANT TO DESCEND TO PERSONALITIES AND YOUR RETIREMENT WOULD BE AN UNQUALIFIABLE DISASTER BUT YOU'LL PARDON MY MENTIONING IT
