7879-274125-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE KING'S SUPPER THE KING WHILE THESE MATTERS WERE BEING ARRANGED WAS SITTING AT THE SUPPER TABLE AND THE NOT VERY LARGE NUMBER OF GUESTS FOR THAT DAY HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS TOO AFTER THE USUAL GESTURE INTIMATING THE ROYAL PERMISSION
7879-274125-0001 WHICH HE DESPAIRED OF BEING ABLE FULLY TO REALIZE THE KING THEREFORE WAS SEATED ALONE AT A SMALL SEPARATE TABLE WHICH LIKE THE DESK OF A PRESIDENT OVERLOOKED THE ADJOINING TABLES
7879-274125-0002 ALTHOUGH WE SAY A SMALL TABLE WE MUST NOT OMIT TO ADD THAT THIS SMALL TABLE WAS THE LARGEST ONE THERE MOREOVER IT WAS THE ONE ON WHICH WERE PLACED THE GREATEST NUMBER AND QUANTITY OF DISHES
7879-274125-0003 CONSISTING OF FISH GAME MEAT FRUIT VEGETABLES AND PRESERVES THE KING WAS YOUNG AND FULL OF VIGOR AND ENERGY VERY FOND OF HUNTING ADDICTED TO ALL VIOLENT EXERCISES OF THE BODY
7879-274125-0004 HE DELIGHTED IN CRITICISING HIS COOKS BUT WHEN HE HONORED THEM BY PRAISE AND COMMENDATION THE HONOR WAS OVERWHELMING THE KING BEGAN BY EATING SEVERAL KINDS OF SOUP EITHER MIXED TOGETHER OR TAKEN SEPARATELY
7879-274125-0005 HE INTERMIXED OR RATHER SEPARATED EACH OF THE SOUPS BY A GLASS OF OLD WINE HE ATE QUICKLY AND SOMEWHAT GREEDILY PORTHOS WHO FROM THE BEGINNING HAD OUT OF RESPECT BEEN WAITING FOR A JOG OF D'ARTAGNAN'S ARM
7879-274125-0006 SEEING THE KING MAKE SUCH RAPID PROGRESS TURNED TO THE MUSKETEER AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE IT SEEMS AS IF ONE MIGHT GO ON NOW HIS MAJESTY IS VERY ENCOURAGING FROM THE EXAMPLE HE SETS LOOK
7879-274125-0007 THE KING EATS SAID D'ARTAGNAN BUT HE TALKS AT THE SAME TIME TRY AND MANAGE MATTERS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN TO ADDRESS A REMARK TO YOU HE WILL NOT FIND YOU WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL WHICH WOULD BE VERY DISRESPECTFUL
7879-274125-0008 THE BEST WAY IN THAT CASE SAID PORTHOS IS TO EAT NO SUPPER AT ALL AND YET I AM VERY HUNGRY I ADMIT AND EVERYTHING LOOKS AND SMELLS MOST INVITINGLY AS IF APPEALING TO ALL MY SENSES AT ONCE
7879-274125-0009 DON'T THINK OF NOT EATING FOR A MOMENT SAID D'ARTAGNAN THAT WOULD PUT HIS MAJESTY OUT TERRIBLY THE KING HAS A SAYING THAT HE WHO WORKS WELL EATS WELL AND HE DOES NOT LIKE PEOPLE TO EAT INDIFFERENTLY AT HIS TABLE
7879-274125-0010 HOW CAN I AVOID HAVING MY MOUTH FULL IF I EAT SAID PORTHOS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO REPLIED THE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS IS SIMPLY TO SWALLOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN IT WHENEVER THE KING DOES YOU THE HONOR TO ADDRESS A REMARK TO YOU
7879-274125-0011 VERY GOOD SAID PORTHOS AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE BEGAN TO EAT WITH A CERTAIN WELL BRED ENTHUSIASM
7879-274125-0012 MONSIEUR DU VALLON HE SAID PORTHOS WAS ENJOYING A SALMI DE LIEVRE AND SWALLOWED HALF OF THE BACK HIS NAME PRONOUNCED IN SUCH A MANNER MADE HIM START AND BY A VIGOROUS EFFORT OF HIS GULLET HE ABSORBED THE WHOLE MOUTHFUL

7879-274125-0017 SIRE I BELIEVE THAT FROM MY OWN PROVINCE AS EVERYWHERE ELSE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING IS SENT TO PARIS FOR YOUR MAJESTY'S USE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DO NOT EAT LAMB IN THE SAME WAY YOUR MAJESTY DOES AH AH

7879-274125-0019 FIRST STUFFS THE LAMB IN QUESTION WITH SMALL SAUSAGES HE PROCURES FROM STRASBURG FORCE MEAT BALLS FROM TROYES AND LARKS FROM PITHIVIERS BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER WHICH I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH
7879-274125-0020 HE BONES THE LAMB AS HE WOULD DO A FOWL LEAVING THE SKIN ON HOWEVER WHICH FORMS A BROWN CRUST ALL OVER THE ANIMAL WHEN IT IS CUT IN BEAUTIFUL SLICES IN THE SAME WAY AS AN ENORMOUS SAUSAGE A ROSE COLORED GRAVY POURS FORTH
7879-274125-0021 WHICH IS AS AGREEABLE TO THE EYE AS IT IS EXQUISITE TO THE PALATE AND PORTHOS FINISHED BY SMACKING HIS LIPS THE KING OPENED HIS EYES WITH DELIGHT AND WHILE CUTTING SOME OF THE
7879-274125-0022 THAT IS A DISH I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO TASTE MONSIEUR DU VALLON IS IT POSSIBLE A WHOLE LAMB ABSOLUTELY AN ENTIRE LAMB SIRE
7879-274125-0023 I PERCEIVE HE IS AN AMATEUR THE ORDER WAS IMMEDIATELY OBEYED THEN CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION HE SAID AND YOU DO NOT FIND THE LAMB TOO FAT NO SIRE THE FAT FALLS DOWN AT THE SAME TIME AS THE GRAVY DOES AND SWIMS ON THE SURFACE
7879-274125-0024 THEN THE SERVANT WHO CARVES REMOVES THE FAT WITH A SPOON WHICH I HAVE HAD EXPRESSLY MADE FOR THAT PURPOSE WHERE DO YOU RESIDE INQUIRED THE KING AT PIERREFONDS SIRE AT PIERREFONDS
7879-274125-0025 OH NO SIRE PIERREFONDS IS IN THE SOISSONNAIS I THOUGHT YOU ALLUDED TO THE LAMB ON ACCOUNT OF THE SALT MARSHES NO SIRE I HAVE MARSHES WHICH ARE NOT SALT IT IS TRUE BUT WHICH ARE NOT THE LESS VALUABLE ON THAT ACCOUNT
7879-274125-0026 THE KING HAD NOW ARRIVED AT THE ENTREMENTS BUT WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF PORTHOS WHO CONTINUED TO PLAY HIS PART IN THE BEST MANNER
7879-274125-0027 AH SIRE IF YOUR MAJESTY WERE EVER TO PAY A VISIT TO PIERREFONDS WE WOULD BOTH OF US EAT OUR LAMB TOGETHER FOR YOUR APPETITE IS NOT AN INDIFFERENT ONE BY ANY MEANS D'ARTAGNAN GAVE PORTHOS A KICK UNDER THE TABLE WHICH MADE PORTHOS COLOR UP
7879-274125-0028 AT YOUR MAJESTY'S PRESENT HAPPY AGE SAID PORTHOS IN ORDER TO REPAIR THE MISTAKE HE HAD MADE I WAS IN THE MUSKETEERS AND NOTHING COULD EVER SATISFY ME THEN YOUR MAJESTY HAS AN EXCELLENT APPETITE AS I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR OF MENTIONING
7879-274125-0029 BUT YOU SELECT WHAT YOU EAT WITH QUITE TOO MUCH REFINEMENT TO BE CALLED FOR ONE MOMENT A GREAT EATER THE KING SEEMED CHARMED AT HIS GUEST'S POLITENESS WILL YOU TRY SOME OF THESE CREAMS HE SAID TO PORTHOS SIRE
7879-274125-0030 YOU MAJESTY TREATS ME WITH FAR TOO MUCH KINDNESS TO PREVENT ME SPEAKING THE WHOLE TRUTH
7879-274125-0031 WILL SIRE WITH REGARD TO SWEET DISHES I ONLY RECOGNIZE PASTRY AND EVEN THAT SHOULD BE RATHER SOLID ALL THESE FROTHY SUBSTANCES SWELL THE STOMACH AND OCCUPY A SPACE WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO BE TOO PRECIOUS TO BE SO BADLY TENANTED
7879-274125-0032 HERE IS INDEED A MODEL OF GASTRONOMY IT WAS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT OUR FATHERS WHO SO WELL KNEW WHAT GOOD LIVING WAS
7879-274125-0033 WHILE WE ADDED HIS MAJESTY DO NOTHING BUT TANTALIZE WITH OUR STOMACHS AND AS HE SPOKE HE TOOK THE BREAST OF A CHICKEN WITH HAM WHILE PORTHOS ATTACKED A DISH OF PARTRIDGES AND QUAILS THE CUP BEARER FILLED HIS MAJESTY'S GLASS
7879-274125-0034 THIS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST HONORS OF THE ROYAL TABLE D'ARTAGNAN PRESSED HIS FRIEND'S KNEE IF YOU COULD ONLY MANAGE TO SWALLOW THE HALF OF THAT BOAR'S HEAD I SEE YONDER SAID HE TO PORTHOS
7879-274125-0035 PRESENTLY SAID PORTHOS PHLEGMATICALLY I SHALL COME TO THAT BY AND BY IN FACT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE IT CAME TO THE BOAR'S TURN FOR THE KING SEEMED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN URGING ON HIS GUEST
7879-274125-0036 HE DID NOT PASS ANY OF THE DISHES TO PORTHOS UNTIL HE HAD TASTED THEM HIMSELF AND HE ACCORDINGLY TOOK SOME OF THE BOAR'S HEAD PORTHOS SHOWED THAT HE COULD KEEP PACE WITH HIS SOVEREIGN
7879-274125-0037 IS IMPOSSIBLE SAID THE KING IN AN UNDERTONE THAT A GENTLEMAN WHO EATS SO GOOD A SUPPER EVERY DAY AND WHO HAS SUCH BEAUTIFUL TEETH CAN BE OTHERWISE THAN THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD UPRIGHT MAN IN MY KINGDOM DO YOU HEAR SAID D'ARTAGNAN IN HIS FRIEND'S EAR
7879-274125-0038 YES I THINK I AM RATHER IN FAVOR SAID PORTHOS BALANCING HIMSELF ON HIS CHAIR OH YOU ARE IN LUCK'S WAY THE KING AND PORTHOS CONTINUED TO EAT IN THE SAME MANNER TO THE GREAT SATISFACTION OF THE OTHER GUESTS
7879-274125-0039 SOME OF WHOM FROM EMULATION HAD ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW THEM BUT WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE UP HALF WAY THE KING SOON BEGAN TO GET FLUSHED AND THE REACTION OF THE BLOOD TO HIS FACE ANNOUNCED THAT THE MOMENT OF REPLETION HAD ARRIVED
7879-274125-0040 PORTHOS ON THE CONTRARY WAS LIVELY AND COMMUNICATIVE D'ARTAGNAN'S FOOT HAD MORE THAN ONCE TO REMIND HIM OF THIS PECULIARITY OF THE KING
