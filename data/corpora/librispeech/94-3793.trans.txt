94-3793-0004 THERE HE CAREFULLY CLEANED HIS TEETH MANY OF WHICH WERE FILLED WITH TOOTH POWDER AND RINSED HIS MOUTH WITH SCENTED ELIXIR AFTER THAT HE WASHED HIS HANDS WITH PERFUMED SOAP CLEANED HIS LONG NAILS WITH PARTICULAR CARE
94-3793-0005 THEN FROM A TAP FIXED TO HIS MARBLE WASHSTAND HE LET A SPRAY OF COLD WATER RUN OVER HIS FACE AND STOUT NECK HAVING FINISHED THIS PART OF THE BUSINESS HE WENT INTO A THIRD ROOM WHERE A SHOWER BATH STOOD READY FOR HIM
94-3793-0006 HAVING REFRESHED HIS FULL WHITE MUSCULAR BODY AND DRIED IT WITH A ROUGH BATH SHEET HE PUT ON HIS FINE UNDERGARMENTS AND HIS BOOTS AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE GLASS TO BRUSH HIS BLACK BEARD AND HIS CURLY HAIR

94-3793-0010 WHICH WAS COVERED WITH A FINE STARCHED CLOTH STOOD A SILVER COFFEEPOT FULL OF AROMATIC COFFEE A SUGAR BASIN A JUG OF FRESH CREAM AND A BREAD BASKET FILLED WITH FRESH ROLLS RUSKS AND BISCUITS
94-3793-0011 AND BESIDE THE PLATE LAY THE LAST NUMBER OF THE REVUE DES DEUX MONDES A NEWSPAPER AND SEVERAL LETTERS NEKHLUDOFF WAS JUST GOING TO OPEN HIS LETTERS WHEN A STOUT MIDDLE AGED WOMAN IN MOURNING
94-3793-0012 A LACE CAP COVERING THE WIDENING PARTING OF HER HAIR GLIDED INTO THE ROOM THIS WAS AGRAPHENA PETROVNA FORMERLY LADY'S MAID TO NEKHLUDOFF'S MOTHER HER MISTRESS HAD DIED QUITE RECENTLY IN THIS VERY HOUSE
94-3793-0013 AND SHE REMAINED WITH THE SON AS HIS HOUSEKEEPER AGRAPHENA PETROVNA HAD SPENT NEARLY TEN YEARS AT DIFFERENT TIMES ABROAD WITH NEKHLUDOFF'S MOTHER AND HAD THE APPEARANCE AND MANNERS OF A LADY
94-3793-0014 SHE HAD LIVED WITH THE NEKHLUDOFFS FROM THE TIME SHE WAS A CHILD AND HAD KNOWN DMITRI IVANOVITCH AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS STILL LITTLE MITINKA GOOD MORNING DMITRI IVANOVITCH GOOD MORNING AGRAPHENA PETROVNA
94-3793-0015 WHAT IS IT YOU WANT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED A LETTER FROM THE PRINCESS EITHER FROM THE MOTHER OR THE DAUGHTER THE MAID BROUGHT IT SOME TIME AGO AND IS WAITING IN MY ROOM
94-3793-0016 HANDING HIM THE LETTER WITH A SIGNIFICANT SMILE ALL RIGHT DIRECTLY SAID NEKHLUDOFF TAKING THE LETTER AND FROWNING AS HE NOTICED AGRAPHENA PETROVNA'S SMILE THAT SMILE MEANT THAT THE LETTER WAS FROM THE YOUNGER PRINCESS KORCHAGIN
94-3793-0017 WHOM AGRAPHENA PETROVNA EXPECTED HIM TO MARRY THIS SUPPOSITION OF HERS ANNOYED NEKHLUDOFF THEN I'LL TELL HER TO WAIT AND AGRAPHENA PETROVNA TOOK A CRUMB BRUSH WHICH WAS NOT IN ITS PLACE
94-3793-0018 PUT IT AWAY AND SAILED OUT OF THE ROOM NEKHLUDOFF OPENED THE PERFUMED NOTE AND BEGAN READING IT THE NOTE WAS WRITTEN ON A SHEET OF THICK GREY PAPER WITH ROUGH EDGES THE WRITING LOOKED ENGLISH
94-3793-0019 THIS NOTE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THAT SKILFUL MANOEUVRING WHICH THE PRINCESS KORCHAGIN HAD ALREADY PRACTISED FOR TWO MONTHS IN ORDER TO BIND HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER WITH INVISIBLE THREADS AND YET
94-3793-0020 BESIDE THE USUAL HESITATION OF MEN PAST THEIR YOUTH TO MARRY UNLESS THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE
94-3793-0021 HE COULD NOT PROPOSE AT ONCE IT WAS NOT THAT TEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BETRAYED AND FORSAKEN MASLOVA HE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THAT AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED IT A REASON FOR NOT MARRYING NO THE REASON WAS
94-3793-0022 THAT HE HAD A LIAISON WITH A MARRIED WOMAN AND THOUGH HE CONSIDERED IT BROKEN OFF SHE DID NOT NEKHLUDOFF WAS RATHER SHY WITH WOMEN AND HIS VERY SHYNESS AWAKENED IN THIS MARRIED WOMAN
94-3793-0023 THE UNPRINCIPLED WIFE OF THE MARECHAL DE NOBLESSE OF A DISTRICT WHERE NEKHLUDOFF WAS PRESENT AT AN ELECTION THE DESIRE OF VANQUISHING HIM THIS WOMAN DREW HIM INTO AN INTIMACY WHICH ENTANGLED HIM MORE AND MORE
94-3793-0024 WHILE IT DAILY BECAME MORE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM HAVING SUCCUMBED TO THE TEMPTATION NEKHLUDOFF FELT GUILTY AND HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO BREAK THE TIE WITHOUT HER CONSENT
94-3793-0025 AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO PROPOSE TO KORCHAGIN EVEN IF HE HAD WISHED TO DO SO AMONG THE LETTERS ON THE TABLE WAS ONE FROM THIS WOMAN'S HUSBAND SEEING HIS WRITING AND THE POSTMARK
94-3793-0026 NEKHLUDOFF FLUSHED AND FELT HIS ENERGIES AWAKENING AS THEY ALWAYS DID WHEN HE WAS FACING ANY KIND OF DANGER BUT HIS EXCITEMENT PASSED AT ONCE THE MARECHAL DO NOBLESSE OF THE DISTRICT IN WHICH HIS LARGEST ESTATE LAY
94-3793-0027 WROTE ONLY TO LET NEKHLUDOFF KNOW THAT THERE WAS TO BE A SPECIAL MEETING TOWARDS THE END OF MAY AND THAT NEKHLUDOFF WAS TO BE SURE AND COME TO
94-3793-0028 AT THE IMPORTANT DEBATES CONCERNING THE SCHOOLS AND THE ROADS AS A STRONG OPPOSITION BY THE REACTIONARY PARTY WAS EXPECTED THE MARECHAL WAS A LIBERAL AND WAS QUITE ENGROSSED IN THIS FIGHT
94-3793-0029 ALSO THE TERRIBLE SCENE HE HAD WITH HER WHEN SHE RAN OUT INTO THE PARK AND IN HER EXCITEMENT TRIED TO DROWN HERSELF IN THE POND
94-3793-0030 A WEEK AGO HE HAD WRITTEN HER A DECISIVE LETTER IN WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GUILT AND HIS READINESS TO ATONE FOR IT
94-3793-0031 FOR HER OWN GOOD AS HE EXPRESSED IT TO THIS LETTER HE HAD AS YET RECEIVED NO ANSWER THIS MIGHT PROVE A GOOD SIGN
94-3793-0032 NEKHLUDOFF HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOME OFFICER WHO WAS PAYING HER MARKED ATTENTION AND THIS TORMENTED HIM BY AWAKENING JEALOUSY AND AT THE SAME TIME ENCOURAGED HIM WITH THE HOPE OF ESCAPE FROM THE DECEPTION THAT WAS OPPRESSING HIM
94-3793-0033 THE OTHER LETTER WAS FROM HIS STEWARD THE STEWARD WROTE TO TELL HIM THAT A VISIT TO HIS ESTATES WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENTER INTO POSSESSION AND ALSO TO DECIDE ABOUT THE FURTHER MANAGEMENT OF HIS LANDS
94-3793-0034 WHETHER IT WAS TO CONTINUE IN THE SAME WAY AS WHEN HIS MOTHER WAS ALIVE OR WHETHER AS HE HAD REPRESENTED TO THE LATE LAMENTED PRINCESS AND NOW ADVISED THE YOUNG PRINCE THEY HAD NOT BETTER INCREASE THEIR STOCK
94-3793-0035 AND FARM ALL THE LAND NOW RENTED BY THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES THE STEWARD WROTE THAT THIS WOULD BE A FAR MORE PROFITABLE WAY OF MANAGING THE PROPERTY
94-3793-0036 DUE ON THE FIRST THIS MONEY WOULD BE SENT ON BY THE NEXT MAIL
94-3793-0037 THIS LETTER WAS PARTLY DISAGREEABLE AND PARTLY PLEASANT IT WAS PLEASANT TO FEEL THAT HE HAD POWER OVER SO LARGE A PROPERTY AND YET DISAGREEABLE
94-3793-0038 BECAUSE NEKHLUDOFF HAD BEEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRER OF HENRY GEORGE AND HERBERT SPENCER BEING HIMSELF HEIR TO A LARGE PROPERTY HE WAS ESPECIALLY STRUCK BY THE POSITION TAKEN UP BY SPENCER IN SOCIAL STATICS
94-3793-0039 THAT JUSTICE FORBIDS PRIVATE LANDHOLDING AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD RESOLUTENESS OF HIS AGE HAD NOT MERELY SPOKEN TO PROVE THAT LAND COULD NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND WRITTEN ESSAYS ON THAT SUBJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY
94-3793-0040 AND CONSIDERING IT WRONG TO HOLD LANDED PROPERTY
94-3793-0041 TO THE PEASANTS INHERITING HIS MOTHER'S LARGE ESTATES AND THUS BECOMING A LANDED PROPRIETOR HE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER TO GIVE UP HIS PROPERTY AS HE HAD GIVEN UP HIS FATHER'S LAND TEN YEARS BEFORE
94-3793-0042 OR SILENTLY TO CONFESS THAT ALL HIS FORMER IDEAS WERE MISTAKEN AND FALSE HE COULD NOT CHOOSE THE FORMER BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS BUT THE LANDED ESTATES HE DID NOT CARE TO SERVE
94-3793-0043 MOREOVER HE HAD FORMED LUXURIOUS HABITS WHICH HE COULD NOT EASILY GIVE UP BESIDES HE HAD NO LONGER THE SAME INDUCEMENTS
94-3793-0044 WERE GONE AS TO THE SECOND COURSE THAT OF DENYING THOSE CLEAR AND UNANSWERABLE PROOFS OF THE INJUSTICE OF LANDHOLDING WHICH HE HAD DRAWN FROM SPENCER'S SOCIAL STATICS
94-3793-0045 AND THE BRILLIANT CORROBORATION OF WHICH HE HAD AT A LATER PERIOD FOUND IN THE WORKS OF HENRY GEORGE
