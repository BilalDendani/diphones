2652-157644-0000 A STORY IS TOLD OF SIR WALTER RALEIGH BY JOHN AUBREY WHICH SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT AT FIRST WOMEN NOT ONLY DID NOT SMOKE BUT THAT THEY DISLIKED SMOKING BY MEN AUBREY SAYS THAT RALEIGH STANDING IN A STAND AT SIR R POYNTZ'S PARKE AT ACTON TOOKE A PIPE OF TOBACCO
2652-157644-0001 WHICH MADE THE LADIES QUITT IT TILL HE HAD DONE BUT THIS OBJECTION WHETHER GENERAL OR NOT SOON VANISHED FOR AS WE HAVE SEEN IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER THE GALLANT OF ELIZABETHAN AND JACOBEAN DAYS
2652-157644-0002 THERE IS A TRADITION THAT QUEEN ELIZABETH HERSELF ONCE SMOKED WITH UNPLEASANT RESULTS
2652-157644-0003 THE QUEEN HAD NO SELFISH DESIRE TO MONOPOLIZE THE NOVEL SENSATIONS CAUSED BY SMOKING
2652-157644-0004 BUT THESE STORIES REST ON VAGUE TRADITION AND PROBABLY HAVE NO FOUNDATION IN FACT
2652-157644-0005 THAT EITHER SHEE MUST ALSO CORRUPT HER SWEETE BREATH THEREWITH OR ELSE RESOLVE TO LIVE IN A PERPETUALL STINKING TORMENT HIS MAJESTY'S STYLE WAS FORCIBLE IF NOT ELEGANT
2652-157644-0006 THERE ARE ALSO ONE OR TWO REFERENCES IN THE EARLY DRAMATISTS IN BEN JONSON'S EVERY MAN IN HIS HUMOUR FOR INSTANCE WHICH WAS FIRST ACTED IN FIFTEEN NINETY EIGHT SIX YEARS BEFORE KING JAMES BLEW HIS ROYAL COUNTER BLASTE
2652-157644-0007 PRYNNE IN HIS ATTACK ON THE STAGE DECLARED THAT WOMEN SMOKED PIPES IN THEATRES BUT THE TRUTH OF THIS STATEMENT MAY WELL BE DOUBTED THE HABIT WAS PROBABLY FAR FROM GENERAL AMONG WOMEN ALTHOUGH JOSHUA SYLVESTER A DOUGHTY OPPONENT OF THE WEED
2652-157644-0008 THE BALLADS OF THE PERIOD ABOUND IN ROUGH WOODCUTS IN WHICH TAVERN SCENES ARE OFTEN FIGURED WHEREIN PEWTER POTS AND TOBACCO PIPES ARE SHOWN LYING ON THE TABLE OR IN THE HANDS OR AT THE MOUTHS OF THE MALE CAROUSERS
2652-157644-0009 EXAMPLE IN THE SHIRBURN BALLADS LIES BEFORE ME THE CUT WHICH IS VERY ROUGH HEADS A BACCHANALIAN BALLAD CHARACTERISTIC OF THE ELIZABETHAN PERIOD CALLED A KNOTTE OF GOOD FELLOWS AND BEGINNING COME HITHER MINE HOST COME HITHER COME HITHER MINE HOST COME HITHER
2652-157644-0010 THE SCENE IS A TAVERN INTERIOR AROUND THE TABLE ARE FOUR MEN AND A WOMAN WHILE A BOY APPROACHES CARRYING TWO HUGE MEASURES OF ALE ONE MAN IS SMOKING FURIOUSLY WHILE ON THE TABLE LIE THREE OTHER PIPES ONE FOR EACH MAN AND SUNDRY POTS AND GLASSES
2652-157644-0011 THE WOMAN IS PLAINLY A CONVIVIAL SOUL BUT THERE IS NO PIPE FOR HER AND SUCH PROVISION WAS NO DOUBT UNUSUAL THERE IS DIRECT EVIDENCE TOO BESIDES THE STORY IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS CHAPTER THAT WOMEN DISLIKED THE PREVALENCE OF SMOKING
2652-157644-0012 FAITH KIND UNCLE WHEN MEN ABANDON JEALOUSY FORSAKE TAKING OF TOBACCO AND CEASE TO WEAR THEIR BEARDS SO RUDELY LONG OH TO HAVE A HUSBAND WITH A MOUTH CONTINUALLY SMOKING WITH A BUSH OF FURS ON THE RIDGE OF HIS CHIN READIE STILL TO FLOP INTO HIS FOAMING CHOPS
2652-157644-0013 TIS MORE THAN MOST INTOLERABLE AND SIMILAR INDICATIONS OF DISLIKE TO SMOKING COULD BE QUOTED FROM OTHER PLAYS ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS CERTAIN THAT FROM COMPARATIVELY EARLY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THERE WERE TO BE FOUND HERE AND THERE WOMEN WHO SMOKED
2652-157644-0014 IN THE RECORD OF AN EARLY LIBEL ACTION BROUGHT IN THE COURT OF THE ARCHDEACON OF ESSEX SOME DOMESTIC SCENES OF SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE ARE VIVIDLY REPRESENTED WE NEED NOT TROUBLE ABOUT THE LIBEL ACTION BUT TWO OF THE DRAMATIS PERSONAE WERE A CERTAIN GEORGE THRESHER
2652-157644-0015 WHO SOLD BEER AND TOBACCO AT HIS SHOPP IN ROMFORD AND A GOOD FRIEND AND CUSTOMER OF HIS NAMED ELIZABETH SAVAGE WHO SAD TO SAY WAS DESCRIBED AS MUCH GIVEN TO STRONGE DRINCKE AND TOBACCO
2652-157644-0016 MISTRESS SAVAGE HAD TO TELL HER TALE PART OF WHICH IS REPORTED AS FOLLOWS GEORGE THRESHER KEPT A SHOPPE IN ROMFORD AND SOLD TOBACCO THERE
2652-157644-0017 SOMETIMES WITH THE SAID GEORGE AND SOMETIMES WITH HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS
2652-157644-0018 HAVE DINED THERE TOGETHER AND PAID THEIR SHARE FOR THEIR DINNER SHEE BEING MANY TIMES MORE WILLING TO DINE THERE THAN AT AN INNE OR TAVERNE ELIZABETH WAS EVIDENTLY OF A SOCIABLE TURN AND THOUGH SHE TURNED HER NOSE UP AT A TAVERN
2652-157644-0019 AND SIMILAR PLEASURES AT AN INN OR TAVERN SOME OF THE REFERENCES TO WOMEN SMOKERS OCCUR IN CURIOUS CONNEXIONS WHEN ONE GEORGE GLAPTHORNE OF WHITTLESEY J P WAS RETURNED TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE ISLE OF ELY IN SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR HIS RETURN WAS PETITIONED AGAINST
2652-157644-0020 AND HAD ALSO UNDERTAKEN TO GRANT HER HUSBAND A LICENCE TO BREW THUS UNDULY INFLUENCING AND CORRUPTING THE ELECTORS
2652-157644-0021 THE REV GILES MOORE RECTOR OF HORSTED KEYNES SUSSEX MADE A NOTE IN HIS JOURNAL AND ACCOUNT BOOK IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE OF
2652-157644-0022 AS FROM OTHER ENTRIES IN MISTER MOORE'S ACCOUNT BOOK WE KNOW THAT TWO OUNCES COST HIM ONE SHILLING WE MAY WONDER WHAT MISSUS MOORE WAS GOING TO DO WITH HER HALF OUNCE
2652-157644-0023 POSSIBLY SHE WAS NOT A SMOKER AT ALL BUT NEEDED THE TOBACCO FOR SOME MEDICINAL PURPOSE THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY EXTRAORDINARY MEDICINAL VIRTUES CONTINUED TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DIVINE WEED
2652-157644-0024 WRITING TO HER HUSBAND ISAAC APPLETON AT HIS CHAMBER IN GRAYES INN AS HIS AFEXTINAT WIFE THE GOOD SUSAN WHOSE SPELLING IS MARVELLOUS TELLS HER SWEET HART I HAVE DONE ALL THE TOBAKCRE YOU LEFT MEE
2652-157644-0025 IN SIXTEEN THIRTY ONE EDMOND HOWES WHO EDITED STOW'S CHRONICLES AND CONTINUED THEM ONTO THE END OF THIS PRESENT YEARE SIXTEEN THIRTY ONE WROTE THAT TOBACCO WAS AT THIS DAY COMMONLY USED BY MOST MEN AND MANY WOMEN
2652-157644-0026 AND SOE SIT ROUND THE FIRE SMOAKING WHICH WAS NOT DELIGHTFUL TO ME WHEN I WENT DOWN TO TALK WITH MY LANDLADY FOR INFORMATION OF ANY MATTER AND CUSTOMES AMONGST THEM WHAT WOULD KING JAMES HAVE THOUGHT OF THESE DEPRAVED CORNISH FOLK
2652-157644-0027 DUNTON IN THAT ATHENIAN ORACLE WHICH WAS A KIND OF EARLY FORERUNNER OF NOTES AND QUERIES ALLUDED TO PIPE SMOKING BY THE GOOD WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE WEST
2652-157644-0028 SAYS THAT THE VERY WOMEN TAKE IT IN ABUNDANCE PARTICULARLY IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES BUT WHY THE VERY WOMEN WHAT OCCASION IS THERE FOR THAT VERY WE WONDER THAT IN CERTAIN PLACES IT SHOULD BE COMMON FOR WOMEN TO TAKE TABACCO AND WHY SHOULD WE WONDER AT IT
2652-157644-0029 AND WHY SHOULD THEY WONDER AT IT IN TRUTH OUR WONDERMENTS ARE VERY PLEASANT THINGS
2652-157644-0030 WHERE HE FOUND HE HAD TO MAKE HIMSELF QUITE AT HOME WITH THE FAMILY OF HIS HOSTESS
2652-157644-0031 AND IF THEY HAVE DAUGHTERS THESE ALSO ARE OF THE COMPANY TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS AT TABLE WITH PLEASANT CONCEITS WHERE THEY DRINK AS MUCH AS THE MEN BUT WHAT QUITE DISGUSTED OUR VISITOR WAS THAT WHEN ONE DRINKS THE HEALTH OF ANY PERSON IN COMPANY
2652-157644-0032 THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY DOES NOT PERMIT YOU TO DRINK MORE THAN HALF THE CUP WHICH IS FILLED UP AND PRESENTED TO HIM OR HER WHOSE HEALTH YOU HAVE DRUNK MOREOVER THE SUPPER BEING FINISHED THEY SET ON THE TABLE HALF A DOZEN PIPES AND A PACKET OF TOBACCO FOR SMOKING
2652-157644-0033 THE SAME CONCLUSION HOLDS GOOD FOR THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AMONG WOMEN OF THE LOWEST CLASS SMOKING WAS PROBABLY COMMON ENOUGH IN FIELDING'S AMELIA A WOMAN OF THE LOWEST CHARACTER IS SPOKEN OF AS SMOKING TOBACCO DRINKING PUNCH TALKING OBSCENELY AND SWEARING AND CURSING
2652-157644-0034 WHICH ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE ALL CAREFULLY NOTED BECAUSE NONE OF THEM WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO THE ORDINARY RESPECTABLE FEMALE THE FINE LADY DISLIKED TOBACCO THE AUTHOR OF A PIPE OF TOBACCO IN DODSLEY'S WELL KNOWN COLLECTION TO WHICH REFERENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE WROTE
2652-157644-0035 LADIES WHEN PIPES ARE BROUGHT AFFECT TO SWOON THEY LOVE NO SMOKE EXCEPT THE SMOKE OF TOWN CITRONIA VOWS IT HAS AN ODIOUS STINK SHE WILL NOT SMOKE YE GODS BUT SHE WILL DRINK AND THE SAME WRITER DESCRIBES TOBACCO AS BY LADIES HATED HATED BY THE BEAUX
2652-157644-0036 YET THERE WERE DOUBTLESS STILL TO BE FOUND HERE AND THERE RESPECTABLE WOMEN WHO OCCASIONALLY INDULGED IN A SMOKE IN AN EARLY SPECTATOR ADDISON GIVES THE RULES OF A TWOPENNY CLUB ERECTED IN THIS PLACE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF FRIENDSHIP AND GOOD NEIGHBOURHOOD WHICH MET IN A LITTLE ALE HOUSE AND WAS FREQUENTED BY ARTISANS AND MECHANICS

2652-157644-0041 A LUXURY WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS AS MUCH ENJOYED AND AS UNIVERSALLY USED BY WOMEN AS BY MEN EVEN QUAKERESSES SOMETIMES SMOKED
2652-157644-0042 A LIST OF THE SEA STORES PUT ON BOARD THE SHIP IN WHICH CERTAIN FRIENDS SAMUEL FOTHERGILL MARY PEISLY KATHERINE PAYTON AND OTHERS SAILED FROM PHILADELPHIA FOR ENGLAND IN JUNE SEVENTEEN FIFTY SIX IS STILL EXTANT
2652-157644-0043 IN THOSE DAYS ATLANTIC PASSAGES WERE LONG AND MIGHT LAST FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AND PASSENGERS PROVISIONED THEMSELVES ACCORDINGLY ON THIS OCCASION THE PASSAGE THOUGH STORMY WAS VERY QUICK FOR IT LASTED ONLY THIRTY FOUR DAYS
2652-157644-0044 THE WOMEN'S CHEST WE ARE TOLD CONTAINED AMONG A HOST OF OTHER GOOD AND USEFUL THINGS BALM SAGE SUMMER SAVOURY HOREHOUND TOBACCO AND ORANGES
2652-157644-0045 A JAR OF ALMOND PASTE GINGER BREAD SAMUEL FOTHERGILL'S NEW CHEST CONTAINED TOBACCO AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS AND A BOX OF PIPES WAS AMONG THE MISCELLANEOUS STORES
2652-157644-0046 THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PIPE SMOKERS AMONG THE WOMEN OF THE POORER CLASSES
2652-157644-0047 NOR HAS THE PRACTICE BY ANY MEANS YET DIED OUT
2652-157644-0048 THE DARLINGTON AND STOCKTON TIMES IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX RECORDED THE DEATH ON DECEMBER TENTH AT WALLBURY IN THE NORTH RIDING OF YORKSHIRE
2652-157644-0049 MISSUS GARBUTT HAD BEEN TWICE MARRIED HER HUSBANDS HAVING BEEN SAILORS DURING THE NAPOLEONIC WARS THE OLD WOMAN SAID THE JOURNAL HAD DWINDLED INTO A SMALL COMPASS BUT SHE WAS FREE FROM PAIN RETAINING ALL HER FACULTIES TO THE LAST AND ENJOYING HER PIPE

2652-157644-0055 AN AMUSING INCIDENT IS RELATED IN FORSTER'S LIFE OF DICKENS WHICH SHOWS HOW ENTIRELY UNKNOWN WAS SMOKING AMONG WOMEN OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER CLASSES IN ENGLAND SOME TEN YEARS AFTER QUEEN VICTORIA CAME TO THE THRONE
2652-157644-0056 DICKENS WAS AT LAUSANNE AND GENEVA IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX AT HIS HOTEL IN GENEVA HE MET A REMARKABLE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER BOTH ENGLISH WHO ADMIRED HIM GREATLY AND WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AT GENOA
2652-157644-0057 SHE ASKED DICKENS IF HE HAD EVER READ SUCH INFERNAL TRASH AS MISSUS GORE'S AND EXCLAIMED OH GOD WHAT A SERMON WE HAD HERE LAST SUNDAY DICKENS AND HIS TWO DAUGHTERS WHO WERE DECIDEDLY IN THE WAY AS WE AGREED AFTERWARDS
2652-157644-0058 DINED BY INVITATION WITH THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THE DAUGHTER ASKED HIM IF HE SMOKED YES SAID DICKENS I GENERALLY TAKE A CIGAR AFTER DINNER WHEN I'M ALONE

2652-157644-0061 SHE CERTAINLY SMOKED SIX OR EIGHT MOTHER GAVE IN SOON I THINK SHE ONLY DID IT OUT OF VANITY AMERICAN LADY HAD BEEN SMOKING ALL THE MORNING I TOOK NO MORE AND DAUGHTER AND THE FRENCHMEN HAD IT ALL TO THEMSELVES
2652-157644-0062 CONCEIVE THIS IN A GREAT HOTEL WITH NOT ONLY THEIR OWN SERVANTS BUT HALF A DOZEN WAITERS COMING CONSTANTLY IN AND OUT I SHOWED NO ATOM OF SURPRISE BUT I NEVER WAS SO SURPRISED
2652-157644-0063 SO RIDICULOUSLY TAKEN ABACK IN MY LIFE FOR IN ALL MY EXPERIENCE OF LADIES OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER I NEVER SAW A WOMAN NOT A BASKET WOMAN OR A GIPSY SMOKE BEFORE THIS LAST REMARK IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT
2652-157644-0064 ONE OF THE FREAKS OF FASHION AT PARIS WAS THE GIVING OF LUNCHEON PARTIES FOR LADIES ONLY AT WHICH CIGARS WERE HANDED ROUND
2652-157644-0065 IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE STEADY GOING FOLK WERE ALARMED AND SHOCKED AT A SUDDEN AND SHORT LIVED OUTBURST OF BLOOMERISM IMPORTED FROM THE UNITED STATES
2652-157644-0066 MASCULINE ATTIRE AND TO EMANCIPATE THEMSELVES FROM THE USUAL CONVENTIONS OF FEMININE DRESS WOULD NATURALLY SEEK TO IMITATE MEN IN OTHER WAYS ALSO LEECH HAD A PICTURE OF A QUIET SMOKE IN PUNCH WHICH DEPICTED FIVE LADIES IN SHORT WIDE SKIRTS AND BLOOMERS IN A TOBACCONIST'S SHOP
2652-157644-0067 TWO SMOKING CIGARS AND ONE A PIPE WHILE ONE OF THE INFERIOR ANIMALS BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS SELLING TOBACCO BUT THIS WAS SATIRE AND HARDLY HAD MUCH RELATION TO FACT
2652-157644-0068 WHEN ONE HEARS OF SLY CIGARETTES BETWEEN FEMININE LIPS AT CROQUET PARTIES THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID SINCE THAT DATE CIGARETTE SMOKING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR AMONG WOMEN AND THE TERM SLY HAS LONG CEASED TO BE APPLICABLE
2652-157644-0069 PUNCH'S POCKET BOOK FOR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HAD AN AMUSING SKIT ON A LADIES READING PARTY TO WHICH MISTER PUNCH ACTED AS COACH AFTER BREAKFAST THE READING LADIES LOUNGED ON THE LAWN WITH CIGARETTES
2652-157644-0070 OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH CIGARETTE SMOKING IS INDULGED IN NOW BY WOMEN IS A QUESTION QUITE UNANSWERABLE YET QUEEN VICTORIA ONCE RECEIVED A PRESENT OF PIPES AND TOBACCO
2652-157644-0071 BY THE HANDS OF SIR RICHARD BURTON THE QUEEN HAD SENT A DAMASK TENT A SILVER PIPE AND TWO SILVER TRAYS TO THE KING OF DAHOMEY THAT POTENTATE TOLD SIR RICHARD THAT THE TENT WAS VERY HANDSOME BUT TOO SMALL
2652-157644-0072 AND THAT THOUGH HE LIKED THE TRAYS VERY MUCH HE THOUGHT THEM HARDLY LARGE ENOUGH TO SERVE AS SHIELDS HE HOPED THAT THE NEXT GIFTS WOULD INCLUDE A CARRIAGE AND PAIR AND A WHITE WOMAN BOTH OF WHICH HE WOULD APPRECIATE VERY MUCH
2652-157644-0073 HOWEVER HE SENT GIFTS IN RETURN TO HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY AND AMONG THEM WERE A WEST AFRICAN STATE UMBRELLA A SELECTION OF HIGHLY COLOURED CLOTHING MATERIALS AND SOME NATIVE PIPES AND TOBACCO FOR THE QUEEN TO SMOKE
2652-157644-0074 MANY ROYAL LADIES OF EUROPE CONTEMPORARIES OF QUEEN VICTORIA AND HER SON HAVE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING CONFIRMED SMOKERS
2652-157644-0075 THE LATE EMPRESS OF AUSTRIA KING ALFONSO'S MOTHER FORMERLY QUEEN REGENT OF SPAIN THE DOWAGER QUEEN MARGHERITA OF ITALY
2652-157644-0076 THE NEWSPAPERS REPORTED NOT LONG AGO FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC THAT THE SMART WOMEN OF CHICAGO HAD SUBSTITUTED CIGARS FOR CIGARETTES ACCORDING TO AN INTERVIEW WITH A CHICAGO HOTEL PROPRIETOR THE FAIR SMOKERS SELECT THEIR CIGARS AS MEN DO
2652-157644-0077 EITHER BLACK AND STRONG OR LIGHT ACCORDING TO TASTE
2652-157644-0078 FOR ONE THING IT LEAVES TOO STRONG AND TOO CLINGING AN ODOUR ON THE CLOTHES ONE OF THE LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS HOWEVER IN THE FASHION PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPERS IS THE ADVENT OF SMOKING JACKETS FOR LADIES
2652-157644-0079 WE ARE INFORMED IN THE USUAL STYLE OF SUCH PAGES THAT THE WELL DRESSED WOMAN HAS BEGUN TO CONSIDER THE LITTLE SMOKING JACKET INDISPENSABLE
2652-157644-0080 BEING EXQUISITELY DRAPED AND FASHIONED OF THE SOFTEST AND MOST ATTRACTIVE OF THE SEASON'S BEAUTIFUL FABRICS
2652-157644-0081 THERE ARE STILL MANY GOOD PEOPLE NOWADAYS WHO ARE SHOCKED AT THE IDEA OF WOMEN SMOKING AND TO THEM MAY BE COMMENDED THE COMMON SENSE WORDS OF BISHOP BOYD CARPENTER FORMERLY OF RIPON WHO ARRIVED IN NEW YORK EARLY IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN
2652-157644-0082 TO DELIVER A SERIES OF LECTURES AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS REPORTED HIM AS SAYING WITH REFERENCE TO THIS SUBJECT MANY WOMEN IN ENGLAND WHO ARE WELL THOUGHT OF SMOKE I DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ENTER INTO THE ETHICAL PART OF THIS MATTER BUT THIS MUCH I SAY
