317-130248-0000 MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE GOT IN MY WAY JUST AS HER LATE MOTHER USED TO GET IN MY WAY ON THE STAIRS AND INSTANTLY SUMMONED ME TO TELL HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED AT THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONE THING TO BE DONE
317-130248-0001 I ACCORDINGLY REPLIED THAT MISTER FRANKLIN AND I HAD BOTH TALKED OF FOREIGN POLITICS TILL WE COULD TALK NO LONGER AND HAD THEN MUTUALLY FALLEN ASLEEP IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN TRY THAT SORT OF ANSWER WHEN YOUR WIFE OR YOUR DAUGHTER
317-130248-0002 AND DEPEND ON THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF WOMEN FOR KISSING AND MAKING IT UP AGAIN AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY THE AFTERNOON WORE ON AND MY LADY AND MISS RACHEL CAME BACK NEEDLESS TO SAY HOW ASTONISHED THEY WERE WHEN THEY HEARD THAT MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE HAD ARRIVED
317-130248-0003 AND HAD GONE OFF AGAIN ON HORSEBACK NEEDLESS ALSO TO SAY THAT THEY ASKED AWKWARD QUESTIONS DIRECTLY AND THAT THE FOREIGN POLITICS AND THE FALLING ASLEEP IN THE SUN WOULDN'T SERVE A SECOND TIME OVER WITH THEM BEING AT THE END OF MY INVENTION
317-130248-0004 WAS ENTIRELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONE OF MISTER FRANKLIN'S FREAKS BEING ASKED UPON THAT WHETHER HIS GALLOPING OFF AGAIN ON HORSEBACK WAS ANOTHER OF MISTER FRANKLIN'S FREAKS I SAID YES IT WAS AND SLIPPED OUT OF IT I THINK VERY CLEVERLY IN THAT WAY
317-130248-0005 HAVING GOT OVER MY DIFFICULTIES WITH THE LADIES I FOUND MORE DIFFICULTIES WAITING FOR ME WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY OWN ROOM IN CAME PENELOPE WITH THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF WOMEN TO KISS AND MAKE IT UP AGAIN AND
317-130248-0006 WITH THE NATURAL CURIOSITY OF WOMEN TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION THIS TIME SHE ONLY WANTED ME TO TELL HER
317-130248-0007 AFTER LEAVING MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME AT THE SHIVERING SAND ROSANNA IT APPEARED HAD RETURNED TO THE HOUSE IN A VERY UNACCOUNTABLE STATE OF MIND SHE HAD TURNED IF PENELOPE WAS TO BE BELIEVED ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
317-130248-0008 SHE HAD BEEN MERRY WITHOUT REASON AND SAD WITHOUT REASON IN ONE BREATH SHE ASKED HUNDREDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AND IN ANOTHER BREATH
317-130248-0009 THAT A STRANGE GENTLEMAN COULD POSSESS ANY INTEREST FOR HER
317-130248-0010 AND SCRIBBLING MISTER FRANKLIN'S NAME INSIDE HER WORKBOX SHE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AGAIN CRYING AND LOOKING AT HER DEFORMED SHOULDER IN THE GLASS HAD SHE AND MISTER FRANKLIN KNOWN ANYTHING OF EACH OTHER BEFORE TO DAY QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
317-130248-0011 HAD THEY HEARD ANYTHING OF EACH OTHER IMPOSSIBLE AGAIN I COULD SPEAK TO MISTER FRANKLIN'S ASTONISHMENT AS GENUINE WHEN HE SAW HOW THE GIRL STARED AT HIM PENELOPE COULD SPEAK TO THE GIRL'S INQUISITIVENESS AS GENUINE
317-130248-0012 WHEN SHE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT MISTER FRANKLIN THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN US CONDUCTED IN THIS WAY WAS TIRESOME ENOUGH UNTIL MY DAUGHTER SUDDENLY ENDED IT BY BURSTING OUT WITH WHAT I THOUGHT THE MOST MONSTROUS SUPPOSITION I HAD EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE
317-130248-0013 FATHER SAYS PENELOPE QUITE SERIOUSLY THERE'S ONLY ONE EXPLANATION OF IT ROSANNA HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AT FIRST SIGHT
317-130248-0014 YOU HAVE HEARD OF BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADIES FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT AND HAVE THOUGHT IT NATURAL ENOUGH BUT A HOUSEMAID OUT OF A REFORMATORY WITH A PLAIN FACE AND A DEFORMED SHOULDER FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
317-130248-0015 WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO COMES ON A VISIT TO HER MISTRESS'S HOUSE MATCH ME THAT IN THE WAY OF AN ABSURDITY OUT OF ANY STORY BOOK IN CHRISTENDOM IF YOU CAN I LAUGHED TILL THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN MY CHEEKS PENELOPE RESENTED MY MERRIMENT
317-130248-0016 I NEVER KNEW YOU CRUEL BEFORE FATHER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY AND WENT OUT MY GIRL'S WORDS FELL UPON ME LIKE A SPLASH OF COLD WATER I WAS SAVAGE WITH MYSELF FOR FEELING
317-130248-0017 UNEASY IN MYSELF THE MOMENT SHE HAD SPOKEN THEM BUT SO IT WAS WE WILL CHANGE THE SUBJECT IF YOU PLEASE I AM SORRY I DRIFTED INTO WRITING ABOUT IT AND NOT WITHOUT REASON
317-130248-0018 THE EVENING CAME AND THE DRESSING BELL FOR DINNER RANG BEFORE MISTER FRANKLIN RETURNED FROM FRIZINGHALL I TOOK HIS HOT WATER UP TO HIS ROOM MYSELF EXPECTING TO HEAR AFTER THIS EXTRAORDINARY DELAY
317-130248-0019 THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AND NO DOUBT TO YOURS ALSO NOTHING HAD HAPPENED HE HAD NOT MET WITH THE INDIANS EITHER GOING OR RETURNING HE HAD DEPOSITED THE MOONSTONE IN THE BANK
317-130248-0020 DESCRIBING IT MERELY AS A VALUABLE OF GREAT PRICE AND HE HAD GOT THE RECEIPT FOR IT SAFE IN HIS POCKET I WENT DOWN STAIRS
317-130248-0021 AFTER ALL OUR EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE DIAMOND EARLIER IN THE DAY HOW THE MEETING BETWEEN MISTER FRANKLIN AND HIS AUNT AND COUSIN WENT OFF IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU I WOULD HAVE GIVEN SOMETHING TO HAVE WAITED AT TABLE THAT DAY
317-130248-0022 BUT IN MY POSITION IN THE HOUSEHOLD WAITING AT DINNER EXCEPT ON HIGH FAMILY FESTIVALS WAS LETTING DOWN MY DIGNITY IN THE EYES OF THE OTHER SERVANTS A THING WHICH MY LADY CONSIDERED ME QUITE PRONE ENOUGH TO DO ALREADY WITHOUT SEEKING OCCASIONS FOR IT
317-130248-0023 THE NEWS BROUGHT TO ME FROM THE UPPER REGIONS THAT EVENING CAME FROM PENELOPE AND THE FOOTMAN PENELOPE MENTIONED THAT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN MISS RACHEL SO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE DRESSING OF HER HAIR AND HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY
317-130248-0024 AS SHE DID WHEN SHE WENT DOWN TO MEET MISTER FRANKLIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE FOOTMAN'S REPORT WAS THAT THE PRESERVATION OF A RESPECTFUL COMPOSURE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS BETTERS AND THE WAITING ON MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AT DINNER WERE TWO OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO RECONCILE WITH EACH OTHER
317-130248-0025 THAT HAD EVER TRIED HIS TRAINING IN SERVICE LATER IN THE EVENING WE HEARD THEM SINGING AND PLAYING DUETS MISTER FRANKLIN PIPING HIGH MISS RACHEL PIPING HIGHER AND MY LADY ON THE PIANO FOLLOWING THEM AS IT WERE OVER HEDGE AND DITCH
317-130248-0026 AND SEEING THEM SAFE THROUGH IT IN A MANNER MOST WONDERFUL AND PLEASANT TO HEAR THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS ON THE TERRACE AT NIGHT LATER STILL I WENT TO MISTER FRANKLIN IN THE SMOKING ROOM WITH THE SODA WATER AND BRANDY AND FOUND THAT MISS RACHEL HAD PUT THE DIAMOND CLEAN OUT OF HIS HEAD
317-130248-0027 WHEN I ENDEAVOURED TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION TO MORE SERIOUS THINGS TOWARDS MIDNIGHT I WENT ROUND THE HOUSE TO LOCK UP ACCOMPANIED BY MY SECOND IN COMMAND SAMUEL THE FOOTMAN AS USUAL
317-130248-0028 WHEN ALL THE DOORS WERE MADE FAST EXCEPT THE SIDE DOOR THAT OPENED ON THE TERRACE I SENT SAMUEL TO BED AND STEPPED OUT FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR BEFORE I TOO
317-130248-0029 IT WAS SO SILENT OUT OF DOORS THAT I HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME VERY FAINT AND LOW THE FALL OF THE SEA AS THE GROUND SWELL HEAVED IT IN ON THE SAND BANK NEAR THE MOUTH OF OUR LITTLE BAY AS THE HOUSE STOOD THE TERRACE SIDE WAS THE DARK SIDE
317-130248-0030 BUT THE BROAD MOONLIGHT SHOWED FAIR ON THE GRAVEL WALK THAT RAN ALONG THE NEXT SIDE TO THE TERRACE LOOKING THIS WAY AFTER LOOKING UP AT THE SKY I SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON IN THE MOONLIGHT THROWN FORWARD FROM BEHIND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
317-130248-0031 BEING OLD AND SLY
317-130248-0032 MY FEET BETRAYED ME ON THE GRAVEL BEFORE I COULD STEAL SUDDENLY ROUND THE CORNER AS I HAD PROPOSED I HEARD LIGHTER FEET THAN MINE AND MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF THEM AS I THOUGHT RETREATING IN A HURRY
317-130248-0033 BY THE TIME I HAD GOT TO THE CORNER THE TRESPASSERS WHOEVER THEY WERE
317-130248-0034 AND WERE HIDDEN FROM SIGHT AMONG THE THICK TREES AND BUSHES IN THAT PART OF THE GROUNDS FROM THE SHRUBBERY THEY COULD EASILY MAKE THEIR WAY OVER OUR FENCE INTO THE ROAD IF I HAD BEEN FORTY YEARS YOUNGER
317-130248-0035 I MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHANCE OF CATCHING THEM BEFORE THEY GOT CLEAR OF OUR PREMISES AS IT WAS I WENT BACK TO SET A GOING A YOUNGER PAIR OF LEGS THAN MINE WITHOUT DISTURBING ANYBODY SAMUEL AND I GOT A COUPLE OF GUNS
317-130248-0036 AND WENT ALL ROUND THE HOUSE AND THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY HAVING MADE SURE THAT NO PERSONS WERE LURKING ABOUT ANYWHERE IN OUR GROUNDS WE TURNED BACK PASSING OVER THE WALK WHERE I HAD SEEN THE SHADOW I NOW NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME
317-130248-0037 A LITTLE BRIGHT OBJECT LYING ON THE CLEAN GRAVEL UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE MOON PICKING THE OBJECT UP I DISCOVERED IT WAS A SMALL BOTTLE CONTAINING A THICK SWEET SMELLING LIQUOR AS BLACK AS INK
317-130248-0038 I SAID NOTHING TO SAMUEL BUT REMEMBERING WHAT PENELOPE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE JUGGLERS AND THE POURING OF THE LITTLE POOL OF INK INTO THE PALM OF THE BOY'S HAND
