1629-139710-0000 THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO ASSURE HIS COUNCIL THAT HE WOULD MAKE IT HIS ENDEAVOUR TO PRESERVE THE GOVERNMENT BOTH IN CHURCH AND STATE AS IT WAS BY LAW ESTABLISHED AND THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT THE CHURCH
1629-139710-0001 GREAT PUBLIC ACCLAMATIONS WERE RAISED OVER THIS FAIR SPEECH AND A GREAT DEAL WAS SAID FROM THE PULPITS AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT THE WORD OF A KING WHICH WAS NEVER BROKEN BY CREDULOUS PEOPLE WHO LITTLE SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD FORMED A SECRET COUNCIL FOR CATHOLIC AFFAIRS OF WHICH A MISCHIEVOUS JESUIT
1629-139710-0002 HE WAS ALWAYS JEALOUS OF MAKING SOME SHOW OF BEING INDEPENDENT OF THE KING OF FRANCE WHILE HE POCKETED HIS MONEY AS NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PUBLISHING TWO PAPERS IN FAVOUR OF POPERY AND NOT LIKELY TO DO IT MUCH SERVICE I SHOULD THINK WRITTEN BY THE KING HIS BROTHER AND FOUND IN HIS STRONG BOX
1629-139710-0003 HE WAS TRIED FOR PERJURY A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE CORONATION AND BESIDES BEING VERY HEAVILY FINED WAS SENTENCED TO STAND TWICE IN THE PILLORY TO BE WHIPPED FROM ALDGATE TO NEWGATE ONE DAY AND FROM NEWGATE TO TYBURN TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS AND TO STAND IN THE PILLORY FIVE TIMES A YEAR AS LONG AS HE LIVED
1629-139710-0004 THIS FEARFUL SENTENCE WAS ACTUALLY INFLICTED ON THE RASCAL BEING UNABLE TO STAND AFTER HIS FIRST FLOGGING HE WAS DRAGGED ON A SLEDGE FROM NEWGATE TO TYBURN AND FLOGGED AS HE WAS DRAWN ALONG HE WAS SO STRONG A VILLAIN THAT HE DID NOT DIE UNDER THE TORTURE
1629-139710-0005 BUT LIVED TO BE AFTERWARDS PARDONED AND REWARDED THOUGH NOT TO BE EVER BELIEVED IN ANY MORE DANGERFIELD THE ONLY OTHER ONE OF THAT CREW LEFT ALIVE WAS NOT SO FORTUNATE HE WAS ALMOST KILLED BY A WHIPPING FROM NEWGATE TO TYBURN AND AS IF THAT WERE NOT PUNISHMENT ENOUGH
1629-139710-0006 A FEROCIOUS BARRISTER OF GRAY'S INN GAVE HIM A POKE IN THE EYE WITH HIS CANE WHICH CAUSED HIS DEATH FOR WHICH THE FEROCIOUS BARRISTER WAS DESERVEDLY TRIED AND EXECUTED AS SOON AS JAMES WAS ON THE THRONE ARGYLE AND MONMOUTH WENT FROM BRUSSELS TO ROTTERDAM AND ATTENDED A MEETING OF SCOTTISH EXILES HELD THERE
1629-139710-0007 TO CONCERT MEASURES FOR A RISING IN ENGLAND IT WAS AGREED THAT ARGYLE SHOULD EFFECT A LANDING IN SCOTLAND AND MONMOUTH IN ENGLAND AND THAT TWO ENGLISHMEN SHOULD BE SENT WITH ARGYLE TO BE IN HIS CONFIDENCE AND TWO SCOTCHMEN WITH THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH
1629-139710-0008 BUT TWO OF HIS MEN BEING TAKEN PRISONERS AT THE ORKNEY ISLANDS THE GOVERNMENT BECAME AWARE OF HIS INTENTION AND WAS ABLE TO ACT AGAINST HIM WITH SUCH VIGOUR AS TO PREVENT HIS RAISING MORE THAN TWO OR THREE THOUSAND HIGHLANDERS ALTHOUGH HE SENT A FIERY CROSS BY TRUSTY MESSENGERS FROM CLAN TO CLAN AND FROM GLEN TO GLEN
1629-139710-0009 AS THE CUSTOM THEN WAS WHEN THOSE WILD PEOPLE WERE TO BE EXCITED BY THEIR CHIEFS AS HE WAS MOVING TOWARDS GLASGOW WITH HIS SMALL FORCE HE WAS BETRAYED BY SOME OF HIS FOLLOWERS TAKEN AND CARRIED WITH HIS HANDS TIED BEHIND HIS BACK TO HIS OLD PRISON IN EDINBURGH CASTLE
1629-139710-0010 JAMES ORDERED HIM TO BE EXECUTED ON HIS OLD SHAMEFULLY UNJUST SENTENCE WITHIN THREE DAYS
1629-139710-0011 HOWEVER THE BOOT WAS NOT APPLIED HE WAS SIMPLY BEHEADED AND HIS HEAD WAS SET UPON THE TOP OF EDINBURGH JAIL ONE OF THOSE ENGLISHMEN WHO HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO HIM WAS THAT OLD SOLDIER RUMBOLD THE MASTER OF THE RYE HOUSE HE WAS SORELY WOUNDED AND WITHIN A WEEK AFTER ARGYLE HAD SUFFERED WITH GREAT COURAGE WAS BROUGHT UP FOR TRIAL
1629-139710-0012 HE TOO WAS EXECUTED AFTER DEFENDING HIMSELF WITH GREAT SPIRIT AND SAYING THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT GOD HAD MADE THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND TO CARRY SADDLES ON THEIR BACKS AND BRIDLES IN THEIR MOUTHS AND TO BE RIDDEN BY A FEW BOOTED AND SPURRED FOR THE PURPOSE IN WHICH I THOROUGHLY AGREE WITH RUMBOLD
1629-139710-0013 THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH PARTLY THROUGH BEING DETAINED AND PARTLY THROUGH IDLING HIS TIME AWAY WAS FIVE OR SIX WEEKS BEHIND HIS FRIEND WHEN HE LANDED AT LYME IN DORSET HAVING AT HIS RIGHT HAND AN UNLUCKY NOBLEMAN CALLED LORD GREY OF WERK
1629-139710-0014 AND A POPISH USURPER AND I KNOW NOT WHAT ELSE CHARGING HIM NOT ONLY WITH WHAT HE HAD DONE WHICH WAS BAD ENOUGH BUT WITH WHAT NEITHER HE NOR ANYBODY ELSE HAD DONE SUCH AS SETTING FIRE TO LONDON AND POISONING THE LATE KING RAISING SOME FOUR THOUSAND MEN BY THESE MEANS HE MARCHED ON TO TAUNTON
1629-139710-0015 FLOWERS WERE STREWN IN HIS WAY AND EVERY COMPLIMENT AND HONOUR THAT COULD BE DEVISED WAS SHOWERED UPON HIM
1629-139710-0016 AND GAVE HIM A BIBLE ORNAMENTED WITH THEIR OWN FAIR HANDS TOGETHER WITH OTHER PRESENTS ENCOURAGED BY THIS HOMAGE HE PROCLAIMED HIMSELF KING AND WENT ON TO BRIDGEWATER BUT HERE THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS UNDER THE EARL OF FEVERSHAM WERE CLOSE AT HAND AND HE WAS SO DISPIRITED AT FINDING THAT HE MADE BUT FEW POWERFUL FRIENDS AFTER ALL
1629-139710-0017 THAT IT WAS A QUESTION WHETHER HE SHOULD DISBAND HIS ARMY AND ENDEAVOUR TO ESCAPE IT WAS RESOLVED AT THE INSTANCE OF THAT UNLUCKY LORD GREY TO MAKE A NIGHT ATTACK ON THE KING'S ARMY AS IT LAY ENCAMPED ON THE EDGE OF A MORASS CALLED SEDGEMOOR THE HORSEMEN WERE COMMANDED BY THE SAME UNLUCKY LORD WHO WAS NOT A BRAVE MAN
1629-139710-0018 HE GAVE UP THE BATTLE ALMOST AT THE FIRST OBSTACLE
1629-139710-0019 THEY WERE SOON DISPERSED BY THE TRAINED SOLDIERS AND FLED IN ALL DIRECTIONS WHEN THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH HIMSELF FLED
1629-139710-0020 THE ONLY OTHER ARTICLES HE HAD UPON HIM WERE A FEW PAPERS AND LITTLE BOOKS ONE OF THE LATTER BEING A STRANGE JUMBLE IN HIS OWN WRITING OF CHARMS SONGS RECIPES AND PRAYERS HE WAS COMPLETELY BROKEN HE WROTE A MISERABLE LETTER TO THE KING BESEECHING AND ENTREATING TO BE ALLOWED TO SEE HIM
1629-139710-0021 ON THE FIFTEENTH OF JULY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE
1629-139710-0022 THE CROWD WAS IMMENSE AND THE TOPS OF ALL THE HOUSES WERE COVERED WITH GAZERS HE HAD SEEN HIS WIFE THE DAUGHTER OF THE DUKE OF BUCCLEUCH
1629-139710-0023 THE LADY HARRIET WENTWORTH WHO WAS ONE OF THE LAST PERSONS HE REMEMBERED IN THIS LIFE BEFORE LAYING DOWN HIS HEAD UPON THE BLOCK HE FELT THE EDGE OF THE AXE AND TOLD THE EXECUTIONER THAT HE FEARED IT WAS NOT SHARP ENOUGH AND THAT THE AXE WAS NOT HEAVY ENOUGH ON THE EXECUTIONER REPLYING THAT IT WAS OF THE PROPER KIND THE DUKE SAID
1629-139710-0024 I PRAY YOU HAVE A CARE AND DO NOT USE ME SO AWKWARDLY AS YOU USED MY LORD RUSSELL THE EXECUTIONER MADE NERVOUS BY THIS AND TREMBLING STRUCK ONCE AND MERELY GASHED HIM IN THE NECK UPON THIS THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED THE MAN REPROACHFULLY IN THE FACE
1629-139710-0025 THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH FOLLOWED THIS MONMOUTH REBELLION FORM THE BLACKEST AND MOST LAMENTABLE PAGE IN ENGLISH HISTORY THE POOR PEASANTS HAVING BEEN DISPERSED WITH GREAT LOSS AND THEIR LEADERS HAVING BEEN TAKEN ONE WOULD THINK THAT THE IMPLACABLE KING MIGHT HAVE BEEN SATISFIED
1629-139710-0026 BUT NO HE LET LOOSE UPON THEM AMONG OTHER INTOLERABLE MONSTERS A COLONEL KIRK
1629-139710-0027 WERE WORTHY OF THEIR LEADER THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY THESE DEMONS IN HUMAN SHAPE ARE FAR TOO HORRIBLE TO BE RELATED HERE
1629-139710-0028 AND RUINING THEM BY MAKING THEM BUY THEIR PARDONS AT THE PRICE OF ALL THEY POSSESSED
1629-139710-0029 TO HAVE BATCHES OF PRISONERS HANGED OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS FOR THE COMPANY'S DIVERSION
1629-139710-0030 THE DETESTABLE KING INFORMED HIM AS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THESE SERVICES THAT HE WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS PROCEEDINGS BUT THE KING'S GREAT DELIGHT WAS IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF JEFFREYS NOW A PEER WHO WENT DOWN INTO THE WEST WITH FOUR OTHER JUDGES TO TRY PERSONS ACCUSED OF HAVING HAD ANY SHARE IN THE REBELLION
1629-139710-0031 WAS CHARGED WITH HAVING GIVEN SHELTER IN HER HOUSE TO TWO FUGITIVES FROM SEDGEMOOR THREE TIMES THE JURY REFUSED TO FIND HER GUILTY UNTIL JEFFREYS BULLIED AND FRIGHTENED THEM INTO THAT FALSE VERDICT WHEN HE HAD EXTORTED IT FROM THEM HE SAID
1629-139710-0032 AS I DARE SAY HE WOULD HE SENTENCED HER TO BE BURNED ALIVE THAT VERY AFTERNOON THE CLERGY OF THE CATHEDRAL AND SOME OTHERS INTERFERED IN HER FAVOUR AND SHE WAS BEHEADED WITHIN A WEEK AS A HIGH MARK OF HIS APPROBATION THE KING MADE JEFFREYS LORD CHANCELLOR AND HE THEN WENT ON TO DORCHESTER TO EXETER
1629-139710-0033 ONE MAN WHO PLEADED NOT GUILTY HE ORDERED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF COURT UPON THE INSTANT AND HANGED
1629-139710-0034 AT DORCHESTER ALONE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS JEFFREYS HANGED EIGHTY PEOPLE BESIDES WHIPPING TRANSPORTING IMPRISONING AND SELLING AS SLAVES GREAT NUMBERS HE EXECUTED IN ALL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR THREE HUNDRED
1629-139710-0035 THESE EXECUTIONS TOOK PLACE AMONG THE NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS OF THE SENTENCED IN THIRTY SIX TOWNS AND VILLAGES THEIR BODIES WERE MANGLED STEEPED IN CALDRONS OF BOILING PITCH AND TAR AND HUNG UP BY THE ROADSIDES IN THE STREETS OVER THE VERY CHURCHES THE SIGHT AND SMELL OF HEADS AND LIMBS
1629-139710-0036 YOU WILL HEAR MUCH OF THE HORRORS OF THE GREAT FRENCH REVOLUTION MANY AND TERRIBLE THEY WERE THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT I KNOW OF NOTHING WORSE DONE BY THE MADDENED PEOPLE OF FRANCE IN THAT AWFUL TIME THAN WAS DONE BY THE HIGHEST JUDGE IN ENGLAND WITH THE EXPRESS APPROVAL OF THE KING OF ENGLAND IN THE BLOODY ASSIZE
1629-139710-0037 JEFFREYS WAS AS FOND OF MONEY FOR HIMSELF AS OF MISERY FOR OTHERS AND HE SOLD PARDONS WHOLESALE TO FILL HIS POCKETS THE KING ORDERED AT ONE TIME A THOUSAND PRISONERS TO BE GIVEN TO CERTAIN OF HIS FAVOURITES IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT BARGAIN WITH THEM FOR THEIR PARDONS
1629-139710-0038 THE YOUNG LADIES OF TAUNTON WHO HAD PRESENTED THE BIBLE WERE BESTOWED UPON THE MAIDS OF HONOUR AT COURT AND THOSE PRECIOUS LADIES MADE VERY HARD BARGAINS WITH THEM INDEED WHEN THE BLOODY ASSIZE WAS AT ITS MOST DISMAL HEIGHT
1629-139710-0039 AND WHEN THE KING HEARD THAT THROUGH DRUNKENNESS AND RAGING HE WAS VERY ILL HIS ODIOUS MAJESTY REMARKED THAT SUCH ANOTHER MAN COULD NOT EASILY BE FOUND IN ENGLAND BESIDES ALL THIS A FORMER SHERIFF OF LONDON NAMED CORNISH WAS HANGED WITHIN SIGHT OF HIS OWN HOUSE AFTER AN ABOMINABLY CONDUCTED TRIAL
1629-139710-0040 FOR HAVING HAD A SHARE IN THE RYE HOUSE PLOT ON EVIDENCE GIVEN BY RUMSEY
1629-139710-0041 AND ON THE VERY SAME DAY A WORTHY WIDOW NAMED ELIZABETH GAUNT WAS BURNED ALIVE AT TYBURN FOR HAVING SHELTERED A WRETCH WHO HIMSELF GAVE EVIDENCE AGAINST HER SHE SETTLED THE FUEL ABOUT HERSELF WITH HER OWN HANDS SO THAT THE FLAMES SHOULD REACH HER QUICKLY
1629-139710-0042 SO HE WENT TO WORK TO CHANGE THE RELIGION OF THE COUNTRY WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED AND WHAT HE DID WAS THIS HE FIRST OF ALL TRIED TO GET RID OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE TEST ACT WHICH PREVENTED THE CATHOLICS FROM HOLDING PUBLIC EMPLOYMENTS BY HIS OWN POWER OF DISPENSING WITH THE PENALTIES
1629-139710-0043 HE TRIED IT IN ONE CASE AND ELEVEN OF THE TWELVE JUDGES DECIDING IN HIS FAVOUR HE EXERCISED IT IN THREE OTHERS
1629-139710-0044 AND WHOM HE KEPT IN THEIR PLACES AND SANCTIONED HE REVIVED THE HATED ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION TO GET RID OF COMPTON BISHOP OF LONDON WHO MANFULLY OPPOSED HIM HE SOLICITED THE POPE TO FAVOUR ENGLAND WITH AN AMBASSADOR WHICH THE POPE WHO WAS A SENSIBLE MAN THEN RATHER UNWILLINGLY DID
1629-139710-0045 HE FAVOURED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CONVENTS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF LONDON HE WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE THE STREETS AND EVEN THE COURT ITSELF FILLED WITH MONKS AND FRIARS IN THE HABITS OF THEIR ORDERS HE CONSTANTLY ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE CATHOLICS OF THE PROTESTANTS ABOUT HIM HE HELD PRIVATE INTERVIEWS WHICH HE CALLED CLOSETINGS
1629-139710-0046 HE TRIED THE SAME THING WITH THE CORPORATIONS AND ALSO THOUGH NOT SO SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE LORD LIEUTENANTS OF COUNTIES TO TERRIFY THE PEOPLE INTO THE ENDURANCE OF ALL THESE MEASURES HE KEPT AN ARMY OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN ENCAMPED ON HOUNSLOW HEATH WHERE MASS WAS OPENLY PERFORMED IN THE GENERAL'S TENT
1629-139710-0047 AND WHERE PRIESTS WENT AMONG THE SOLDIERS ENDEAVOURING TO PERSUADE THEM TO BECOME CATHOLICS FOR CIRCULATING A PAPER AMONG THOSE MEN ADVISING THEM TO BE TRUE TO THEIR RELIGION A PROTESTANT CLERGYMAN NAMED JOHNSON THE CHAPLAIN OF THE LATE LORD RUSSELL WAS ACTUALLY SENTENCED TO STAND THREE TIMES IN THE PILLORY
1629-139710-0048 AND WAS ACTUALLY WHIPPED FROM NEWGATE TO TYBURN HE DISMISSED HIS OWN BROTHER IN LAW FROM HIS COUNCIL BECAUSE HE WAS A PROTESTANT AND MADE A PRIVY COUNCILLOR OF THE BEFORE MENTIONED FATHER PETRE HE HANDED IRELAND OVER TO RICHARD TALBOT EARL OF TYRCONNELL
1629-139710-0049 A WORTHLESS DISSOLUTE KNAVE WHO PLAYED THE SAME GAME THERE FOR HIS MASTER AND WHO PLAYED THE DEEPER GAME FOR HIMSELF OF ONE DAY PUTTING IT UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE FRENCH KING IN GOING TO THESE EXTREMITIES EVERY MAN OF SENSE AND JUDGMENT AMONG THE CATHOLICS FROM THE POPE TO A PORTER KNEW THAT THE KING WAS A MERE BIGOTED FOOL
1629-139710-0050 WHO WOULD UNDO HIMSELF AND THE CAUSE HE SOUGHT TO ADVANCE BUT HE WAS DEAF TO ALL REASON AND HAPPILY FOR ENGLAND EVER AFTERWARDS WENT TUMBLING OFF HIS THRONE IN HIS OWN BLIND WAY A SPIRIT BEGAN TO ARISE IN THE COUNTRY WHICH THE BESOTTED BLUNDERER LITTLE EXPECTED HE FIRST FOUND IT OUT IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE
1629-139710-0051 HAVING MADE A CATHOLIC A DEAN AT OXFORD WITHOUT ANY OPPOSITION HE TRIED TO MAKE A MONK A MASTER OF ARTS AT CAMBRIDGE WHICH ATTEMPT THE UNIVERSITY RESISTED AND DEFEATED HIM HE THEN WENT BACK TO HIS FAVOURITE OXFORD
1629-139710-0052 HIS LAST PLUNGE HEAD FOREMOST IN HIS TUMBLE OFF HIS THRONE HE HAD ISSUED A DECLARATION THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO RELIGIOUS TESTS OR PENAL LAWS IN ORDER TO LET IN THE CATHOLICS MORE EASILY BUT THE PROTESTANT DISSENTERS UNMINDFUL OF THEMSELVES HAD GALLANTLY JOINED THE REGULAR CHURCH IN OPPOSING IT TOOTH AND NAIL
1629-139710-0053 WHEN THEY GOT TO THE TOWER THE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS ON GUARD BESOUGHT THEM FOR THEIR BLESSING WHILE THEY WERE CONFINED THERE THE SOLDIERS EVERY DAY DRANK TO THEIR RELEASE WITH LOUD SHOUTS WHEN THEY WERE BROUGHT UP TO THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH FOR THEIR TRIAL WHICH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID WAS FOR THE HIGH OFFENCE OF CENSURING THE GOVERNMENT
1629-139710-0054 AND GIVING THEIR OPINION ABOUT AFFAIRS OF STATE THEY WERE ATTENDED BY SIMILAR MULTITUDES AND SURROUNDED BY A THRONG OF NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN WHEN THE JURY WENT OUT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT TO CONSIDER OF THEIR VERDICT EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE KING KNEW THAT THEY WOULD RATHER STARVE THAN YIELD TO THE KING'S BREWER WHO WAS ONE OF THEM
1629-139710-0055 IT DID NOT PASS ONLY TO THE EAST BUT PASSED TO THE WEST TOO UNTIL IT REACHED THE CAMP AT HOUNSLOW WHERE THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND SOLDIERS TOOK IT UP AND ECHOED IT AND STILL WHEN THE DULL KING WHO WAS THEN WITH LORD FEVERSHAM HEARD THE MIGHTY ROAR ASKED IN ALARM WHAT IT WAS AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NOTHING BUT THE ACQUITTAL OF THE BISHOPS
1629-139710-0056 HE SAID IN HIS DOGGED WAY CALL YOU THAT NOTHING IT IS SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THEM
1629-139710-0057 BUT I DOUBT IF SAINT WINIFRED HAD MUCH TO DO WITH IT AS THE KING'S FRIEND INASMUCH AS THE ENTIRELY NEW PROSPECT OF A CATHOLIC SUCCESSOR FOR BOTH THE KING'S DAUGHTERS WERE PROTESTANTS DETERMINED THE EARLS OF SHREWSBURY DANBY AND DEVONSHIRE LORD LUMLEY THE BISHOP OF LONDON
1629-139710-0058 ADMIRAL RUSSELL AND COLONEL SIDNEY TO INVITE THE PRINCE OF ORANGE OVER TO ENGLAND THE ROYAL MOLE SEEING HIS DANGER AT LAST MADE IN HIS FRIGHT MANY GREAT CONCESSIONS BESIDES RAISING AN ARMY OF FORTY THOUSAND MEN BUT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WAS NOT A MAN FOR JAMES THE SECOND TO COPE WITH
1629-139710-0059 HIS PREPARATIONS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY VIGOROUS AND HIS MIND WAS RESOLVED FOR A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE PRINCE WAS READY TO SAIL FOR ENGLAND A GREAT WIND FROM THE WEST PREVENTED THE DEPARTURE OF HIS FLEET EVEN WHEN THE WIND LULLED AND IT DID SAIL IT WAS DISPERSED BY A STORM AND WAS OBLIGED TO PUT BACK TO REFIT
1629-139710-0060 ON MONDAY THE FIFTH IT ANCHORED AT TORBAY IN DEVONSHIRE AND THE PRINCE WITH A SPLENDID RETINUE OF OFFICERS AND MEN MARCHED INTO EXETER BUT THE PEOPLE IN THAT WESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY HAD SUFFERED SO MUCH IN THE BLOODY ASSIZE THAT THEY HAD LOST HEART FEW PEOPLE JOINED HIM AND HE BEGAN TO THINK OF RETURNING
1629-139710-0061 AND PUBLISHING THE INVITATION HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THOSE LORDS AS HIS JUSTIFICATION FOR HAVING COME AT ALL AT THIS CRISIS SOME OF THE GENTRY JOINED HIM
1629-139710-0062 OF THE PROTESTANT RELIGION AND OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE FROM THAT TIME THE CAUSE RECEIVED NO CHECK
1629-139710-0063 IF HE WANTED ANY MONEY BY THIS TIME THE KING WAS RUNNING ABOUT IN A PITIABLE WAY TOUCHING PEOPLE FOR THE KING'S EVIL IN ONE PLACE REVIEWING HIS TROOPS IN ANOTHER AND BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE IN A THIRD THE YOUNG PRINCE WAS SENT TO PORTSMOUTH
1629-139710-0064 IN THE NIGHT HIS DAUGHTER ANNE FLED FROM WHITEHALL PALACE AND THE BISHOP OF LONDON WHO HAD ONCE BEEN A SOLDIER RODE BEFORE HER WITH A DRAWN SWORD IN HIS HAND AND PISTOLS AT HIS SADDLE GOD HELP ME CRIED THE MISERABLE KING MY VERY CHILDREN HAVE FORSAKEN ME
1629-139710-0065 IN HIS WILDNESS AFTER DEBATING WITH SUCH LORDS AS WERE IN LONDON WHETHER HE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT CALL A PARLIAMENT AND AFTER NAMING THREE OF THEM TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE PRINCE HE RESOLVED TO FLY TO FRANCE HE HAD THE LITTLE PRINCE OF WALES BROUGHT BACK FROM PORTSMOUTH AND THE CHILD AND THE QUEEN CROSSED THE RIVER TO LAMBETH IN AN OPEN BOAT
1629-139710-0066 ON A MISERABLE WET NIGHT AND GOT SAFELY AWAY THIS WAS ON THE NIGHT OF THE NINTH OF DECEMBER AT ONE O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE ELEVENTH THE KING WHO HAD IN THE MEANTIME RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE PRINCE OF ORANGE STATING HIS OBJECTS GOT OUT OF BED
1629-139710-0067 AND WENT DOWN THE BACK STAIRS THE SAME I SUPPOSE BY WHICH THE PRIEST IN THE WIG AND GOWN HAD COME UP TO HIS BROTHER AND CROSSED THE RIVER IN A SMALL BOAT SINKING THE GREAT SEAL OF ENGLAND BY THE WAY
1629-139710-0068 HE RODE ACCOMPANIED BY SIR EDWARD HALES TO FEVERSHAM WHERE HE EMBARKED IN A CUSTOM HOUSE HOY THE MASTER OF THIS HOY WANTING MORE BALLAST
1629-139710-0069 AND INFORMED THE KING OF THEIR SUSPICIONS THAT HE WAS A HATCHET FACED JESUIT AS THEY TOOK HIS MONEY AND WOULD NOT LET HIM GO HE TOLD THEM WHO HE WAS AND THAT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WANTED TO TAKE HIS LIFE AND HE BEGAN TO SCREAM FOR A BOAT
1629-139710-0070 HE PUT HIMSELF INTO THE HANDS OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT OF THE COUNTY
1629-139710-0071 WHO ONLY WANTING TO GET RID OF HIM AND NOT CARING WHERE HE WENT SO THAT HE WENT AWAY WAS VERY MUCH DISCONCERTED THAT THEY DID NOT LET HIM GO HOWEVER THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO HAVE HIM BROUGHT BACK WITH SOME STATE IN THE WAY OF LIFE GUARDS TO WHITEHALL AND AS SOON AS HE GOT THERE IN HIS INFATUATION HE HEARD MASS
1629-139710-0072 AND SET A JESUIT TO SAY GRACE AT HIS PUBLIC DINNER THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN THROWN INTO THE STRANGEST STATE OF CONFUSION BY HIS FLIGHT AND HAD TAKEN IT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT THE IRISH PART OF THE ARMY WERE GOING TO MURDER THE PROTESTANTS THEREFORE THEY SET THE BELLS A RINGING AND LIGHTED WATCH FIRES
1629-139710-0073 AND BURNED CATHOLIC CHAPELS AND LOOKED ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR FATHER PETRE AND THE JESUITS WHILE THE POPE'S AMBASSADOR WAS RUNNING AWAY IN THE DRESS OF A FOOTMAN THEY FOUND NO JESUITS BUT A MAN WHO HAD ONCE BEEN A FRIGHTENED WITNESS BEFORE JEFFREYS IN COURT
1629-139710-0074 THE PEOPLE TO THEIR LASTING HONOUR DID NOT TEAR HIM TO PIECES AFTER KNOCKING HIM ABOUT A LITTLE THEY TOOK HIM IN THE BASEST AGONIES OF TERROR TO THE LORD MAYOR WHO SENT HIM AT HIS OWN SHRIEKING PETITION TO THE TOWER FOR SAFETY THERE HE DIED THEIR BEWILDERMENT CONTINUING
1629-139710-0075 THE PEOPLE NOW LIGHTED BONFIRES AND MADE REJOICINGS AS IF THEY HAD ANY REASON TO BE GLAD TO HAVE THE KING BACK AGAIN BUT HIS STAY WAS VERY SHORT FOR THE ENGLISH GUARDS WERE REMOVED FROM WHITEHALL DUTCH GUARDS WERE MARCHED UP TO IT AND HE WAS TOLD BY ONE OF HIS LATE MINISTERS THAT THE PRINCE WOULD ENTER LONDON NEXT DAY AND HE HAD BETTER GO TO HAM
1629-139710-0076 HE THOUGHT HIMSELF VERY CUNNING IN THIS AS HE MEANT TO ESCAPE FROM ROCHESTER TO FRANCE
1629-139710-0077 SO HE WENT TO GRAVESEND IN HIS ROYAL BARGE ATTENDED BY CERTAIN LORDS AND WATCHED BY DUTCH TROOPS AND PITIED BY THE GENEROUS PEOPLE WHO WERE FAR MORE FORGIVING THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN WHEN THEY SAW HIM IN HIS HUMILIATION ON THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY THIRD OF DECEMBER NOT EVEN THEN UNDERSTANDING THAT EVERYBODY WANTED TO GET RID OF HIM
1629-139710-0078 HE WENT OUT ABSURDLY THROUGH HIS ROCHESTER GARDEN DOWN TO THE MEDWAY AND GOT AWAY TO FRANCE WHERE HE REJOINED THE QUEEN THERE HAD BEEN A COUNCIL IN HIS ABSENCE OF THE LORDS AND THE AUTHORITIES OF LONDON WHEN THE PRINCE CAME ON THE DAY AFTER THE KING'S DEPARTURE HE SUMMONED THE LORDS TO MEET HIM
1629-139710-0079 AND SOON AFTERWARDS ALL THOSE WHO HAD SERVED IN ANY OF THE PARLIAMENTS OF KING CHARLES THE SECOND IT WAS FINALLY RESOLVED BY THESE AUTHORITIES THAT THE THRONE WAS VACANT BY THE CONDUCT OF KING JAMES THE SECOND THAT IT WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THIS PROTESTANT KINGDOM TO BE GOVERNED BY A POPISH PRINCE
1629-139710-0080 AND THAT THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD SUCCEED THEM IF THEY HAD ANY THAT IF THEY HAD NONE THE PRINCESS ANNE AND HER CHILDREN SHOULD SUCCEED THAT IF SHE HAD NONE THE HEIRS OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE SHOULD SUCCEED
