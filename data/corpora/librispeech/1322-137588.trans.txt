1322-137588-0000 AFTER THE DEATH OF UTHER PENDRAGON REIGNED ARTHUR HIS SON THE WHICH HAD GREAT WAR IN HIS DAYS FOR TO GET ALL ENGLAND INTO HIS HAND FOR THERE WERE MANY KINGS WITHIN THE REALM OF ENGLAND AND IN WALES SCOTLAND AND CORNWALL
1322-137588-0001 IF THIS BE TRUE SAID ARTHUR IT WERE GREAT SHAME UNTO MINE ESTATE BUT THAT HE WERE MIGHTILY WITHSTOOD IT IS TRUTH SAID THE KNIGHT FOR I SAW THE HOST MYSELF WELL SAID THE KING LET MAKE A CRY
1322-137588-0002 THAT ALL THE LORDS KNIGHTS AND GENTLEMEN OF ARMS SHOULD DRAW UNTO A CASTLE CALLED CAMELOT IN THOSE DAYS AND THERE THE KING WOULD LET MAKE A COUNCIL GENERAL AND A GREAT JOUSTS
1322-137588-0003 SO WHEN THE KING WAS COME THITHER WITH ALL HIS BARONAGE AND LODGED AS THEY SEEMED BEST THERE WAS COME A DAMOSEL THE WHICH WAS SENT ON MESSAGE FROM THE GREAT LADY LILE OF AVELION AND WHEN SHE CAME BEFORE KING ARTHUR
1322-137588-0004 SHE TOLD FROM WHOM SHE CAME AND HOW SHE WAS SENT ON MESSAGE UNTO HIM FOR THESE CAUSES THEN SHE LET HER MANTLE FALL THAT WAS RICHLY FURRED AND THEN WAS SHE GIRT WITH A NOBLE SWORD WHEREOF THE KING HAD MARVEL AND SAID DAMOSEL
1322-137588-0005 FOR WHAT CAUSE ARE YE GIRT WITH THAT SWORD IT BESEEMETH YOU NOT NOW SHALL I TELL YOU SAID THE DAMOSEL THIS SWORD THAT I AM GIRT WITHAL DOTH ME GREAT SORROW AND CUMBRANCE FOR I MAY NOT BE DELIVERED OF THIS SWORD BUT BY A KNIGHT
1322-137588-0006 BUT HE MUST BE A PASSING GOOD MAN OF HIS HANDS AND OF HIS DEEDS AND WITHOUT VILLAINY OR TREACHERY AND WITHOUT TREASON AND IF I MAY FIND SUCH A KNIGHT THAT HATH ALL THESE VIRTUES HE MAY DRAW OUT THIS SWORD OUT OF THE SHEATH
1322-137588-0007 FOR I HAVE BEEN AT KING RIENCE'S IT WAS TOLD ME THERE WERE PASSING GOOD KNIGHTS AND HE AND ALL HIS KNIGHTS HAVE ASSAYED IT AND NONE CAN SPEED THIS IS A GREAT MARVEL SAID ARTHUR IF THIS BE SOOTH
1322-137588-0008 NOT PRESUMING UPON MYSELF THAT I AM THE BEST KNIGHT BUT THAT I WILL BEGIN TO DRAW AT YOUR SWORD IN GIVING EXAMPLE TO ALL THE BARONS
1322-137588-0009 THEN ARTHUR TOOK THE SWORD BY THE SHEATH AND BY THE GIRDLE AND PULLED AT IT EAGERLY BUT THE SWORD WOULD NOT OUT SIR SAID THE DAMOSEL YOU NEED NOT TO PULL HALF SO HARD FOR HE THAT SHALL PULL IT OUT SHALL DO IT WITH LITTLE MIGHT
1322-137588-0010 FOR HE MUST BE A CLEAN KNIGHT WITHOUT VILLAINY AND OF A GENTLE STRAIN OF FATHER SIDE AND MOTHER SIDE MOST OF ALL THE BARONS OF THE ROUND TABLE THAT WERE THERE AT THAT TIME ASSAYED ALL BY ROW BUT THERE MIGHT NONE SPEED
1322-137588-0011 WHEREFORE THE DAMOSEL MADE GREAT SORROW OUT OF MEASURE AND SAID ALAS I WEENED IN THIS COURT HAD BEEN THE BEST KNIGHTS WITHOUT TREACHERY OR TREASON BY MY FAITH SAID ARTHUR HERE ARE GOOD KNIGHTS AS I DEEM AS ANY BE IN THE WORLD
1322-137588-0012 BUT THEIR GRACE IS NOT TO HELP YOU
1322-137588-0013 FOR HE WAS A GOOD MAN NAMED OF HIS BODY AND HE WAS BORN IN NORTHUMBERLAND AND SO HE WENT PRIVILY INTO THE COURT AND SAW THIS ADVENTURE WHEREOF IT RAISED HIS HEART
1322-137588-0014 BUT FOR HE WAS POOR AND POORLY ARRAYED HE PUT HIM NOT FAR IN PRESS BUT IN HIS HEART HE WAS FULLY ASSURED TO DO AS WELL IF HIS GRACE HAPPED HIM AS ANY KNIGHT THAT THERE WAS AND AS THE DAMOSEL TOOK HER LEAVE OF ARTHUR AND OF ALL THE BARONS
1322-137588-0015 SO DEPARTING THIS KNIGHT BALIN CALLED UNTO HER AND SAID DAMOSEL I PRAY YOU OF YOUR COURTESY
1322-137588-0016 THOUGH THAT I BE SO POORLY CLOTHED IN MY HEART MESEEMETH I AM FULLY ASSURED AS SOME OF THESE OTHERS AND MESEEMETH IN MY HEART TO SPEED RIGHT WELL
1322-137588-0017 THE DAMOSEL BEHELD THE POOR KNIGHT AND SAW HE WAS A LIKELY MAN BUT FOR HIS POOR ARRAYMENT SHE THOUGHT HE SHOULD BE OF NO WORSHIP WITHOUT VILLAINY OR TREACHERY AND THEN SHE SAID UNTO THE KNIGHT SIR IT NEEDETH NOT TO PUT ME TO MORE PAIN OR LABOUR
1322-137588-0018 FOR IT SEEMETH NOT YOU TO SPEED THERE AS OTHER HAVE FAILED AH FAIR DAMOSEL SAID BALIN WORTHINESS AND GOOD TATCHES AND GOOD DEEDS ARE NOT ONLY IN ARRAYMENT BUT MANHOOD AND WORSHIP IS HID WITHIN MAN'S PERSON
1322-137588-0019 WELL SAID THE DAMOSEL YE ARE NOT WISE TO KEEP THE SWORD FROM ME FOR YE SHALL SLAY WITH THE SWORD THE BEST FRIEND THAT YE HAVE AND THE MAN THAT YE MOST LOVE IN THE WORLD AND THE SWORD SHALL BE YOUR DESTRUCTION I SHALL TAKE THE ADVENTURE SAID BALIN
1322-137588-0020 THAT GOD WILL ORDAIN ME BUT THE SWORD YE SHALL NOT HAVE AT THIS TIME BY THE FAITH OF MY BODY YE SHALL REPENT IT WITHIN SHORT TIME SAID THE DAMOSEL FOR I WOULD HAVE THE SWORD MORE FOR YOUR AVAIL THAN FOR MINE FOR I AM PASSING HEAVY FOR YOUR SAKE
1322-137588-0021 NAY SAID THE KING I SUPPOSE YE WILL NOT DEPART SO LIGHTLY FROM THIS FELLOWSHIP I SUPPOSE YE ARE DISPLEASED THAT I HAVE SHEWED YOU UNKINDNESS BLAME ME THE LESS FOR I WAS MISINFORMED AGAINST YOU BUT I WEENED YE HAD NOT BEEN SUCH A KNIGHT AS YE ARE
1322-137588-0022 OF WORSHIP AND PROWESS AND IF YE WILL ABIDE IN THIS COURT AMONG MY FELLOWSHIP I SHALL SO ADVANCE YOU AS YE SHALL BE PLEASED GOD THANK YOUR HIGHNESS SAID BALIN YOUR BOUNTY AND HIGHNESS MAY NO MAN PRAISE HALF TO THE VALUE
1322-137588-0023 TRULY SAID THE KING I AM RIGHT WROTH FOR YOUR DEPARTING I PRAY YOU FAIR KNIGHT THAT YE TARRY NOT LONG AND YE SHALL BE RIGHT WELCOME TO ME AND TO MY BARONS AND I SHALL AMEND ALL MISS THAT I HAVE DONE AGAINST YOU
1322-137588-0024 GOD THANK YOUR GREAT LORDSHIP SAID BALIN AND THEREWITH MADE HIM READY TO DEPART
1322-137588-0025 AND THERE ASKED HIM A GIFT THAT HE PROMISED HER WHEN SHE GAVE HIM THE SWORD THAT IS SOOTH SAID ARTHUR A GIFT I PROMISED YOU BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NAME OF MY SWORD THAT YE GAVE ME THE NAME OF IT SAID THE LADY IS EXCALIBUR
1322-137588-0026 OR ELSE THE DAMOSEL'S HEAD THAT BROUGHT IT I TAKE NO FORCE THOUGH I HAVE BOTH THEIR HEADS FOR HE SLEW MY BROTHER A GOOD KNIGHT AND A TRUE AND THAT GENTLEWOMAN WAS CAUSER OF MY FATHER'S DEATH TRULY SAID KING ARTHUR
1322-137588-0027 I MAY NOT GRANT NEITHER OF THEIR HEADS WITH MY WORSHIP THEREFORE ASK WHAT YE WILL ELSE AND I SHALL FULFIL YOUR DESIRE I WILL ASK NONE OTHER THING SAID THE LADY WHEN BALIN WAS READY TO DEPART HE SAW THE LADY OF THE LAKE
1322-137588-0028 THAT BY HER MEANS HAD SLAIN BALIN'S MOTHER AND HE HAD SOUGHT HER THREE YEARS AND WHEN IT WAS TOLD HIM THAT SHE ASKED HIS HEAD OF KING ARTHUR HE WENT TO HER STRAIGHT AND SAID EVIL BE YOU FOUND YE WOULD HAVE MY HEAD AND THEREFORE YE SHALL LOSE YOURS
1322-137588-0029 AND WITH HIS SWORD LIGHTLY HE SMOTE OFF HER HEAD BEFORE KING ARTHUR ALAS FOR SHAME SAID ARTHUR WHY HAVE YE DONE SO YE HAVE SHAMED ME AND ALL MY COURT FOR THIS WAS A LADY THAT I WAS BEHOLDEN TO
1322-137588-0030 AND HITHER SHE CAME UNDER MY SAFE CONDUCT I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE YOU THAT TRESPASS SIR SAID BALIN ME FORTHINKETH OF YOUR DISPLEASURE FOR THIS SAME LADY WAS THE UNTRUEST LADY LIVING
1322-137588-0031 AND BY ENCHANTMENT AND SORCERY SHE HATH BEEN THE DESTROYER OF MANY GOOD KNIGHTS AND SHE WAS CAUSER THAT MY MOTHER WAS BURNT THROUGH HER FALSEHOOD AND TREACHERY WHAT CAUSE SOEVER YE HAD SAID ARTHUR YE SHOULD HAVE FORBORNE HER IN MY PRESENCE
1322-137588-0032 THEREFORE THINK NOT THE CONTRARY YE SHALL REPENT IT FOR SUCH ANOTHER DESPITE HAD I NEVER IN MY COURT THEREFORE WITHDRAW YOU OUT OF MY COURT IN ALL HASTE YE MAY THEN BALIN TOOK UP THE HEAD OF THE LADY AND BARE IT WITH HIM TO HIS HOSTELRY
1322-137588-0033 AND THERE HE MET WITH HIS SQUIRE THAT WAS SORRY HE HAD DISPLEASED KING ARTHUR AND SO THEY RODE FORTH OUT OF THE TOWN NOW SAID BALIN WE MUST DEPART TAKE THOU THIS HEAD AND BEAR IT TO MY FRIENDS AND TELL THEM HOW I HAVE SPED
1322-137588-0034 AND TELL MY FRIENDS IN NORTHUMBERLAND THAT MY MOST FOE IS DEAD ALSO TELL THEM HOW I AM OUT OF PRISON AND WHAT ADVENTURE BEFELL ME AT THE GETTING OF THIS SWORD ALAS SAID THE SQUIRE YE ARE GREATLY TO BLAME FOR TO DISPLEASE KING ARTHUR

1322-137588-0041 SHE WENT TO THE LADY LILE OF AVELION AND BESOUGHT HER OF HELP
1322-137588-0042 I KNOW IT AS WELL AS YE WOULD GOD SHE HAD NOT COME INTO THIS COURT BUT SHE CAME NEVER IN FELLOWSHIP OF WORSHIP TO DO GOOD BUT ALWAYS GREAT HARM AND THAT KNIGHT THAT HATH ACHIEVED THE SWORD SHALL BE DESTROYED BY THAT SWORD
