4590-18006-0000 CHAPTER TEN THE COMPLETION OF THE TSAVO BRIDGE WHEN ALL THE EXCITEMENT HAD DIED DOWN AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY DREAD OF THE MAN EATERS WORK WENT ON BRISKLY
4590-18006-0001 AS THE PIERS AND ABUTMENTS PROGRESSED IN HEIGHT THE QUESTION OF HOW TO LIFT THE LARGE STONES INTO THEIR POSITIONS HAD TO BE SOLVED WE POSSESSED NO CRANES FOR THIS PURPOSE SO I SET TO WORK AND IMPROVISED A SHEARS MADE OF A COUPLE OF THIRTY FOOT RAILS
4590-18006-0002 WHILE THE OTHER ENDS WERE FIXED AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TEN FEET APART IN A LARGE BLOCK OF WOOD THIS CONTRIVANCE ACTED CAPITALLY AND BY MANIPULATION OF ROPES AND PULLEYS THE HEAVY STONES WERE SWUNG INTO POSITION QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
4590-18006-0003 SO THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE MASONRY OF THE BRIDGE WAS COMPLETED THE NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO SPAN THE SIXTY FOOT DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PIERS WITH IRON GIRDERS AS I HAD NEITHER WINCHES NOR SUFFICIENT BLOCKS AND TACKLE TO HAUL THESE OVER INTO POSITION
4590-18006-0004 I WAS DRIVEN TO ERECT TEMPORARY PIERS IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH SPAN BUILT UP CRIB SHAPE OF WOODEN SLEEPERS GREAT WOODEN BEAMS WERE STRETCHED ACROSS FROM THE STONE PIERS TO THESE CRIBS AND LAID WITH RAILS AND THE GIRDER WAS RUN OVER ITS EXACT PLACE
4590-18006-0005 WHILE STILL ON THE TRUCKS IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP FROM THE COAST IT WAS NEXT JACKED UP FROM THE TRUCKS WHICH WERE HAULED AWAY EMPTY THE TEMPORARY BRIDGE WAS DISMANTLED AND THE GIRDER FINALLY LOWERED GENTLY INTO POSITION WHEN THE LAST GIRDER WAS THUS SUCCESSFULLY PLACED
4590-18006-0006 NO TIME WAS LOST IN LINKING UP THE PERMANENT WAY AND VERY SOON I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING THE FIRST TRAIN CROSS THE FINISHED WORK CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ONLY A DAY OR SO AFTER THE BRIDGE HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND THE INTERMEDIATE CRIBS CLEARED AWAY A TREMENDOUS RAIN STORM BROKE OVER THE COUNTRY
4590-18006-0007 TEARING UP TREES BY THE ROOTS AND WHIRLING THEM ALONG LIKE STRAWS STEADILY HIGHER AND HIGHER ROSE THE FLOOD AND STANDING ON MY BRIDGE I WATCHED EXPECTANTLY
4590-18006-0008 WE HAD BUILT ACROSS THE STREAM IN ORDER TO BRING STONE AND SAND TO THE MAIN WORK TO GIVE WAY BEFORE THE EVER RISING VOLUME OF WATER
4590-18006-0009 SWEEPING WITH ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE FORCE ROUND THE BEND OF THE RIVER SOME LITTLE DISTANCE ABOVE THE BRIDGE THIS I KNEW WAS THE DEBRIS OF THE TROLLEY CROSSING FURTHEST UP THE RIVER ON IT CAME AND WITH IT AN ADDITIONAL BANK OF STORMY LOOKING WATER
4590-18006-0010 THERE WAS A DULL THUD AND A RENDING AND RIVING OF TIMBERS AND THEN THE FLOOD ROLLED ON
4590-18006-0011 LEAVING NOT A VESTIGE OF THE TWO BRIDGES BEHIND IT THE IMPACT INDEED WAS SO GREAT THAT THE RAILS WERE TWISTED ROUND THE BROKEN TREE TRUNKS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SO MUCH ORDINARY WIRE THE DOUBLE TIER OF WRECKAGE NOW SWEPT FORWARD AND HURLED ITSELF
4590-18006-0012 WITH A SULLEN PLUNGE AGAINST THE CUTWATERS OF MY STONE PIERS THE SHOCK WAS GREAT BUT TO MY IMMENSE SATISFACTION THE BRIDGE TOOK IT WITHOUT A TREMOR
4590-18006-0013 ON ITS JOURNEY TO THE OCEAN I CONFESS THAT I WITNESSED THE WHOLE OCCURRENCE WITH A THRILL OF PRIDE
4590-18006-0014 IT WAS VISITED BY LEOPARDS HYENAS WILD DOGS WILD CATS AND OTHER INHABITANTS OF THE JUNGLE AROUND US THESE ANIMALS DID A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE TO THE HERDS OF SHEEP AND GOATS WHICH WERE KEPT TO SUPPLY THE COMMISSARIAT
4590-18006-0015 AND THERE WAS ALWAYS GREAT REJOICING WHEN A CAPTURE WAS MADE IN ONE OF THE MANY TRAPS THAT WERE LAID FOR THEM LEOPARDS ESPECIALLY ARE MOST DESTRUCTIVE OFTEN KILLING SIMPLY FOR PLEASURE AND NOT FOR FOOD AND I HAVE ALWAYS HARBOURED ANIMOSITY TOWARDS
4590-18006-0016 THEM SINCE THE NIGHT WHEN ONE WANTONLY DESTROYED A WHOLE HERD OF MINE
4590-18006-0017 AND WHICH WERE SECURED AT SUNDOWN IN A GRASS HUT AT ONE CORNER OF MY BOMA ONE PARTICULARLY DARK NIGHT WE WERE STARTLED BY A TREMENDOUS COMMOTION IN THIS SHED BUT AS THIS WAS BEFORE THE MAN EATERS WERE KILLED NO ONE DARED STIR OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE DISTURBANCE
4590-18006-0018 I NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT THE INTRUDER WAS ONE OF THE DEMONS
4590-18006-0019 IN SPITE OF THESE HOWEVER IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THE NOISE DIED DOWN AND EVERYTHING BECAME STILL AGAIN
4590-18006-0020 THE SHED TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THERE TO MY INTENSE ANGER I FOUND EVERY ONE OF MY SHEEP AND GOATS LYING STRETCHED DEAD ON THE GROUND WITH ITS THROAT BITTEN THROUGH
4590-18006-0021 AND I SAW FROM THIS AND FROM THE TRACKS ALL ROUND THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER HAD BEEN A LEOPARD
4590-18006-0022 I HOPED THAT HE WOULD RETURN THE NEXT NIGHT TO MAKE A MEAL
4590-18006-0023 I ACCORDINGLY LEFT THE CARCASES EXACTLY AS THEY LAY AND HAVING A VERY POWERFUL STEEL TRAP
4590-18006-0024 AND SECURED IT BY A STOUT CHAIN TO A LONG STAKE DRIVEN INTO THE GROUND OUTSIDE DARKNESS FOUND EVERYONE IN MY BOMA ON THE ALERT AND LISTENING ANXIOUSLY TO HEAR THE NOISE THE LEOPARD WOULD MAKE THE MOMENT HE WAS CAUGHT IN THE TRAP
4590-18006-0025 NOR WERE WE DISAPPOINTED FOR ABOUT MIDNIGHT WE HEARD THE CLICK OF THE POWERFUL SPRING
4590-18006-0026 I HAD BEEN SITTING ALL EVENING WITH MY RIFLE BY MY SIDE AND A LANTERN LIGHTED
4590-18006-0027 WATCHMAN CARRYING THE LAMP AS WE APPROACHED THE SHED THE LEOPARD MADE A FRANTIC SPRING IN OUR DIRECTION AS FAR AS THE CHAIN WOULD ALLOW HIM AND THIS SO FRIGHTENED THE CHAUKIDAR THAT HE FLED IN TERROR LEAVING ME IN UTTER DARKNESS
4590-18006-0028 THE NIGHT WAS AS BLACK AS HAD BEEN THE PREVIOUS ONE AND I COULD SEE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
4590-18006-0029 AS HIS STRUGGLES CEASED AND ALL WAS STILL I CALLED OUT THAT HE WAS DEAD AND AT ONCE EVERYONE IN THE BOMA TURNED OUT BRINGING ALL THE LANTERNS IN THE PLACE
4590-18006-0030 WHO SHOUTED THAT HE TOO WANTED REVENGE AS SOME OF THE GOATS HAD BELONGED TO HIM WHEREUPON HE LEVELLED HIS REVOLVER AT THE DEAD LEOPARD AND SHUTTING HIS EYES TIGHTLY FIRED FOUR SHOTS IN RAPID SUCCESSION NATURALLY NOT ONE OF THESE TOUCHED THE BEAST
4590-18006-0031 BUT THEY CAUSED CONSIDERABLE CONSTERNATION AMONGST THE ONLOOKERS WHO SCATTERED RAPIDLY TO RIGHT AND LEFT NEXT MORNING A PARTY OF STARVING WA KAMBA HAPPENED TO BE PASSING JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO SKIN THE LEOPARD
4590-18006-0032 AND THEN TO TAKE THE MEAT I OF COURSE ASSENTED TO THIS PROPOSAL AND IN A VERY FEW MINUTES THE SKIN HAD BEEN NEATLY TAKEN OFF AND THE FAMISHING NATIVES BEGAN A RAVENOUS MEAL ON THE RAW FLESH
4590-18006-0033 WILD DOGS ARE ALSO VERY DESTRUCTIVE AND OFTEN CAUSED GREAT LOSSES AMONG OUR SHEEP AND GOATS MANY A NIGHT HAVE I LISTENED TO THESE ANIMALS HUNTING AND HARRYING SOME POOR CREATURE OF THE WILDS ROUND MY CAMP THEY NEVER RELINQUISH A CHASE AND WILL ATTACK ANYTHING
4590-18006-0034 MAN OR BEAST WHEN REALLY DRIVEN BY HUNGER
