1422-146123-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE GIFT OF HIDING PRIVATE EMOTION AND KEEPING UP APPEARANCES BEFORE STRANGERS IS NOT AS MANY SUPPOSE ENTIRELY A PRODUCT OF OUR MODERN CIVILIZATION
1422-146123-0001 CENTURIES BEFORE WE WERE BORN OR THOUGHT OF THERE WAS A WIDELY PRESS AGENTED BOY IN SPARTA WHO EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO LET A FOX GNAW HIS TENDER YOUNG STOMACH WITHOUT PERMITTING THE DISCOMFORT INSEPARABLE FROM SUCH A PROCEEDING TO INTERFERE
1422-146123-0002 WITH EITHER HIS FACIAL EXPRESSION OR HIS FLOW OF SMALL TALK HISTORIANS HAVE HANDED IT DOWN THAT EVEN IN THE LATER STAGES OF THE MEAL THE POLITE LAD CONTINUED TO BE THE LIFE AND SOUL OF THE PARTY
1422-146123-0003 BUT WHILE THIS FEAT MAY BE SAID TO HAVE ESTABLISHED A RECORD NEVER SUBSEQUENTLY LOWERED THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT ALMOST EVERY DAY IN MODERN TIMES MEN AND WOMEN ARE PERFORMING SIMILAR AND SCARCELY LESS IMPRESSIVE MIRACLES OF SELF RESTRAINT
1422-146123-0004 OF ALL THE QUALITIES WHICH BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO MAN AND ARE NOT SHARED BY THE LOWER ANIMALS THIS SURELY IS THE ONE WHICH MARKS HIM OFF MOST SHARPLY FROM THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD ANIMALS CARE NOTHING ABOUT KEEPING UP APPEARANCES
1422-146123-0005 OBSERVE BERTRAM THE BULL WHEN THINGS ARE NOT GOING JUST AS HE COULD WISH HE STAMPS HE SNORTS HE PAWS THE GROUND HE THROWS BACK HIS HEAD AND BELLOWS HE IS UPSET AND HE DOESN'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT
1422-146123-0006 INSTANCES COULD BE READILY MULTIPLIED DEPOSIT A CHARGE OF SHOT IN SOME OUTLYING SECTION OF THOMAS THE TIGER AND NOTE THE EFFECT IRRITATE WILFRED THE WASP OR STAND BEHIND MAUD THE MULE AND PROD HER WITH A PIN
1422-146123-0007 THAT NOT ONE OF THEM FAILED TO COME THROUGH THE ORDEAL WITH SUCCESS THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS REPRESENTED BY THE UNCLES COUSINS AND AUNTS WHO HAD DESCENDED ON THE PLACE TO HELP LORD BELPHER CELEBRATE HIS COMING OF AGE HAD NOT A NOTION
1422-146123-0008 WHEN HE TACKLED HIM IN THE GARDEN ON THE SUBJECT OF INTEMPERANCE FOR UNCLE FRANCIS LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS HAD TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED ON READING THE REPORT OF THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE POLICEMAN AND PERCY'S SUBSEQUENT ARREST
1422-146123-0009 AND THAT THERE WAS HOPE FOR HIM AFTER ALL PROVIDED THAT HE FOUGHT THE IMPULSE HE LITTLE KNEW THAT BUT FOR THE CONVENTIONS WHICH FROWN ON THE PRACTICE OF MURDERING BISHOPS PERCY WOULD GLADLY HAVE STRANGLED HIM WITH HIS BARE HANDS
1422-146123-0010 AND JUMPED UPON THE REMAINS LORD BELPHER'S CASE INASMUCH AS HE TOOK HIMSELF EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY AND WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO CAN EXTRACT HUMOUR EVEN FROM THEIR OWN MISFORTUNES WAS PERHAPS THE HARDEST WHICH COMES UNDER OUR NOTICE
1422-146123-0011 BUT SO THICKLY DID IT BRISTLE WITH OBSTACLES AND DANGERS THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MILE OF NO MAN'S LAND TWICE SINCE THE OCCASION WHEN THE DISCOVERY OF LORD MARSHMORETON AT THE COTTAGE
1422-146123-0012 HAD CAUSED HER TO ABANDON HER PURPOSE OF GOING IN AND EXPLAINING EVERYTHING TO GEORGE HAD SHE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY AND EACH TIME SOME TRIFLING MADDENING ACCIDENT HAD BROUGHT ABOUT FAILURE ONCE JUST AS SHE WAS STARTING
1422-146123-0013 HER AUNT AUGUSTA HAD INSISTED ON JOINING HER FOR WHAT SHE DESCRIBED AS A NICE LONG WALK AND THE SECOND TIME WHEN SHE WAS WITHIN A BARE HUNDRED YARDS OF HER OBJECTIVE SOME SORT OF A COUSIN POPPED OUT FROM NOWHERE AND FORCED HIS LOATHSOME COMPANY ON HER
1422-146123-0014 FOILED IN THIS FASHION SHE HAD FALLEN BACK IN DESPERATION ON HER SECOND LINE OF ATTACK SHE HAD WRITTEN A NOTE TO GEORGE EXPLAINING THE WHOLE SITUATION IN GOOD CLEAR PHRASES AND BEGGING HIM AS A MAN OF PROVED CHIVALRY
1422-146123-0015 TO HELP HER IT HAD TAKEN UP MUCH OF ONE AFTERNOON THIS NOTE FOR IT WAS NOT EASY TO WRITE AND IT HAD RESULTED IN NOTHING SHE HAD GIVEN IT TO ALBERT TO DELIVER AND ALBERT HAD RETURNED EMPTY HANDED
1422-146123-0016 NO ANSWER BUT THERE MUST BE AN ANSWER
1422-146123-0017 STOUTLY MAINTAINED THE BLACK SOULED BOY WHO HAD DESTROYED THE LETTER WITHIN TWO MINUTES AFTER IT HAD BEEN HANDED TO HIM HE HAD NOT EVEN BOTHERED TO READ IT A DEEP DANGEROUS DASTARDLY STRIPLING THIS WHO FOUGHT TO WIN
1422-146123-0018 AND ONLY TO WIN THE TICKET MARKED R BYNG WAS IN HIS POCKET AND IN HIS RUTHLESS HEART A FIRM RESOLVE THAT R BYNG AND NO OTHER SHOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HIS ASSISTANCE MAUD COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT
1422-146123-0019 THAT IS TO SAY SHE RESOLUTELY KEPT HERSELF FROM ACCEPTING THE ONLY EXPLANATION OF THE EPISODE THAT SEEMED POSSIBLE IN BLACK AND WHITE SHE HAD ASKED GEORGE TO GO TO LONDON AND SEE GEOFFREY AND ARRANGE FOR THE PASSAGE
1422-146123-0020 THROUGH HIMSELF AS A SORT OF CLEARING HOUSE OF LETTERS BETWEEN GEOFFREY AND HERSELF SHE HAD FELT FROM THE FIRST THAT SUCH A REQUEST SHOULD BE MADE BY HER IN PERSON AND NOT THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF WRITING BUT SURELY IT WAS INCREDIBLE THAT A MAN LIKE GEORGE
1422-146123-0021 WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH FOR HER AND WHOSE ONLY REASON FOR BEING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS TO HELP HER COULD HAVE COLDLY REFUSED WITHOUT EVEN A WORD AND YET WHAT ELSE WAS SHE TO THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER SHE FELT ALONE IN A HOSTILE WORLD
1422-146123-0022 YET TO HER GUESTS SHE WAS BRIGHT AND ENTERTAINING NOT ONE OF THEM HAD A SUSPICION THAT HER LIFE WAS NOT ONE OF PURE SUNSHINE ALBERT I AM HAPPY TO SAY WAS THOROUGHLY MISERABLE
1422-146123-0023 THE LITTLE BRUTE WAS SUFFERING TORMENTS HE WAS SHOWERING ANONYMOUS ADVICE TO THE LOVELORN ON REGGIE BYNG EXCELLENT STUFF CULLED FROM THE PAGES OF WEEKLY PAPERS OF WHICH THERE WAS A PILE IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM THE PROPERTY OF A SENTIMENTAL LADY'S MAID
1422-146123-0024 BUT FOR ALL THE EFFECT THEY APPEARED TO EXERCISE ON THEIR RECIPIENT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BLANK PAGES THE CHOICEST QUOTATIONS FROM THE WORKS OF SUCH ESTABLISHED WRITERS AS AUNT CHARLOTTE OF FORGET ME NOT
1422-146123-0025 REGGIE POSITIVELY AVOIDED MAUD'S SOCIETY AND THIS AFTER READING DOCTOR CUPID'S INVALUABLE TIP ABOUT SEEKING HER COMPANY ON ALL OCCASIONS AND THE DICTUM OF AUNT CHARLOTTE TO THE EFFECT THAT
1422-146123-0026 SO FAR FROM RENDERING HIMSELF INDISPENSABLE TO MAUD BY CONSTANT LITTLE ATTENTIONS REGGIE TO THE DISGUST OF HIS BACKER AND SUPPORTER SEEMED TO SPEND MOST OF HIS TIME WITH ALICE FARADAY ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS
1422-146123-0027 HAD ALBERT BEEN REVOLTED BY THE SIGHT OF HIS PROTEGE IN CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH THE FARADAY GIRL ONCE IN A BOAT ON THE LAKE AND TWICE IN HIS GREY CAR IT WAS ENOUGH TO BREAK A BOY'S HEART AND IT COMPLETELY SPOILED ALBERT'S APPETITE
1422-146123-0028 STRAY GAY SNATCHES OF MELODIES POPULAR IN THE EIGHTIES HEAR HIM NOW AS HE TOILS HE HAS A LONG GARDEN IMPLEMENT IN HIS HAND AND HE IS SENDING UP THE DEATH RATE IN SLUG CIRCLES WITH A DEVASTATING RAPIDITY
1422-146123-0029 AND THE BOOM IS A DEATH KNELL AS IT RINGS SOFTLY OUT ON THE PLEASANT SPRING AIR ANOTHER STOUT SLUG HAS MADE THE GREAT CHANGE IT IS PECULIAR THIS GAIETY IT GIVES ONE TO THINK
