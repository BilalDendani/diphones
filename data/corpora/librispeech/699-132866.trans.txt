699-132866-0000 CHAPTER FOUR IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED THAT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AND MISSUS WILKINS TRAVELING TOGETHER SHOULD ARRIVE AT SAN SALVATORE ON THE EVENING OF MARCH THIRTY FIRST
699-132866-0001 WERE TO ARRIVE ON THE MORNING OF APRIL SECOND IN THIS WAY EVERYTHING WOULD BE GOT NICELY READY FOR THE TWO WHO SEEMED IN SPITE OF THE EQUALITY OF THE SHARING YET TO HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT THEM OF GUESTS
699-132866-0002 WHEN MISSUS WILKINS HER HEART IN HER MOUTH
699-132866-0003 TERROR AND DETERMINATION TOLD HER HUSBAND THAT SHE HAD BEEN INVITED TO ITALY AND HE DECLINED TO BELIEVE IT OF COURSE HE DECLINED TO BELIEVE IT
699-132866-0004 BUT AFTER WHAT ENTREATIES WHAT PASSIONATE PERSUADING MISSUS ARBUTHNOT HAD NOT IMAGINED SHE WOULD HAVE TO FACE MISTER WILKINS AND SAY THINGS TO HIM
699-132866-0005 ONE WOMAN BEING HAPPY AND THESE PITEOUS MULTITUDES SHE WAS UNABLE TO LOOK THE VICAR IN THE FACE HE DID NOT KNOW NOBODY KNEW WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO
699-132866-0006 AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SHE WAS UNABLE TO LOOK ANYBODY IN THE FACE SHE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM MAKING SPEECHES APPEALING FOR MONEY HOW COULD SHE STAND UP AND ASK PEOPLE FOR MONEY
699-132866-0007 WHEN SHE HERSELF WAS SPENDING SO MUCH ON HER OWN SELFISH PLEASURE NOR DID IT HELP HER OR QUIET HER THAT HAVING ACTUALLY TOLD FREDERICK IN HER DESIRE TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT SHE WAS SQUANDERING THAT SHE WOULD BE GRATEFUL
699-132866-0008 HE ASKED NO QUESTIONS SHE WAS SCARLET HE LOOKED AT HER A MOMENT AND THEN LOOKED AWAY IT WAS A RELIEF TO FREDERICK THAT SHE SHOULD TAKE SOME MONEY SHE GAVE IT ALL IMMEDIATELY TO THE ORGANIZATION SHE WORKED WITH
699-132866-0009 AND FOUND HERSELF MORE TANGLED IN DOUBTS THAN EVER MISSUS WILKINS ON THE CONTRARY HAD NO DOUBTS SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS A MOST PROPER THING TO HAVE A HOLIDAY AND ALTOGETHER RIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL
699-132866-0010 TO SPEND ONE'S OWN HARD COLLECTED SAVINGS ON BEING HAPPY
699-132866-0011 WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS MISTER WILKINS COMING BACK DAILY TO HIS DINNER AND EATING HIS FISH IN THE SILENCE OF IMAGINED SECURITY
699-132866-0012 THERE BEING FIVE IN THAT MARCH AND IT BEING ON THE FIFTH OF THEM THAT SHE AND MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WERE TO START SHE WOULD TELL MELLERSH OF HER INVITATION ON THE THIRD SUNDAY THEN AFTER A VERY WELL COOKED LUNCH
699-132866-0013 I AM THINKING OF TAKING YOU TO ITALY FOR EASTER AND PAUSED FOR HER ASTOUNDED AND GRATEFUL ECSTASY NONE CAME THE SILENCE IN THE ROOM
699-132866-0014 AND SHE HAD NOT YET EVEN PREPARED THE FORM OF WORDS IN WHICH SHE WOULD BREAK IT MISTER WILKINS WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABROAD SINCE BEFORE THE WAR AND WAS NOTICING WITH INCREASING DISGUST
699-132866-0015 AS WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK OF WIND AND RAIN THE PECULIAR PERSISTENT VILENESS OF THE WEATHER AND SLOWLY CONCEIVED A DESIRE TO GET AWAY FROM ENGLAND FOR EASTER
699-132866-0016 PROBABLY SHE WAS ABSORBED IN SOME FOOLISH DAY DREAM IT WAS REGRETTABLE HOW CHILDISH SHE REMAINED HE TURNED HIS HEAD THEIR CHAIRS WERE IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND LOOKED AT HER
699-132866-0017 SHE WAS STARING STRAIGHT INTO THE FIRE AND IT WAS NO DOUBT THE FIRE THAT MADE HER FACE SO RED I AM THINKING HE REPEATED RAISING HIS CLEAR CULTIVATED VOICE AND SPEAKING WITH ACERBITY
699-132866-0018 FOR INATTENTION AT SUCH A MOMENT WAS DEPLORABLE OF TAKING YOU TO ITALY FOR EASTER DID YOU NOT HEAR ME YES SHE HAD HEARD HIM
699-132866-0019 REALLY MOST EXTRAORDINARY
699-132866-0020 HOW SHE HAD BEEN INVITED A FRIEND HAD INVITED HER EASTER TOO EASTER WAS IN APRIL WASN'T IT
699-132866-0021 A HAD A HOUSE THERE IN FACT MISSUS WILKINS DRIVEN BY TERROR GUILT AND SURPRISE HAD BEEN MORE INCOHERENT IF POSSIBLE THAN USUAL
699-132866-0022 IT WAS A DREADFUL AFTERNOON MELLERSH PROFOUNDLY INDIGNANT BESIDES HAVING HIS INTENDED TREAT COMING BACK ON HIM LIKE A BLESSING TO ROOST
699-132866-0023 CROSS EXAMINED HER WITH THE UTMOST SEVERITY HE DEMANDED THAT SHE REFUSE THE INVITATION HE DEMANDED THAT SINCE SHE HAD SO OUTRAGEOUSLY ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM
699-132866-0024 WE'RE NOT ANY LONGER REAL HUMAN BEINGS REAL HUMAN BEINGS AREN'T EVER AS GOOD AS WE'VE BEEN OH SHE CLENCHED HER THIN HANDS TO THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO BE SO HAPPY NOW
699-132866-0025 MISSUS ARBUTHNOT ALWAYS SILENT ABOUT HIM HAD SAID NOTHING OF THIS TO MISSUS WILKINS FREDERICK WENT TOO DEEP INTO HER HEART FOR HER TO TALK ABOUT HIM
699-132866-0026 SURE AS SHE SO MISERABLY WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO ANYTHING SHE DID SHE MERELY WROTE HIM A NOTE AND PUT IT ON THE HALL TABLE READY FOR HIM IF AND WHEN HE SHOULD COME HOME
699-132866-0027 THERE WAS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD HE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED HE WOULD NOT CARE THE DAY WAS WRETCHED BLUSTERING AND WET THE CROSSING WAS ATROCIOUS AND THEY WERE VERY SICK
699-132866-0028 BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN VERY SICK JUST TO ARRIVE AT CALAIS AND NOT BE SICK WAS HAPPINESS AND IT WAS THERE THAT THE REAL SPLENDOUR OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING FIRST BEGAN TO WARM THEIR BENUMBED SPIRITS
699-132866-0029 IT GOT HOLD OF MISSUS WILKINS FIRST AND SPREAD FROM HER LIKE A ROSE COLOURED FLAME OVER HER PALE COMPANION MELLERSH AT CALAIS WHERE THEY RESTORED THEMSELVES WITH SOLES
699-132866-0030 NOT A SINGLE OFFICIAL AT CALAIS CARED A FIG FOR MELLERSH IN PARIS THERE WAS NO TIME TO THINK OF HIM BECAUSE THEIR TRAIN WAS LATE
699-132866-0031 AND BY THE AFTERNOON OF THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY GOT INTO ITALY ENGLAND FREDERICK MELLERSH THE VICAR THE POOR HAMPSTEAD THE CLUB SHOOLBRED
699-132866-0032 EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING THE WHOLE INFLAMED SORE DREARINESS
