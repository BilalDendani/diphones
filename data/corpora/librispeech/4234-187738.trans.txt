4234-187738-0000 I SUPPOSE I HAD SET EYES UPON FU MANCHU SOME FIVE OR SIX TIMES PRIOR TO THIS OCCASION AND NOW HE WAS DRESSED IN THE MANNER WHICH I ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH HIM PROBABLY BECAUSE IT WAS THUS I FIRST SAW HIM
4234-187738-0001 HE WORE A PLAIN YELLOW ROBE AND WITH HIS POINTED CHIN RESTING UPON HIS BOSOM HE LOOKED DOWN AT ME REVEALING A GREAT EXPANSE OF THE MARVELOUS BROW WITH ITS SPARSE NEUTRAL COLORED HAIR
4234-187738-0002 NEVER IN MY EXPERIENCE HAVE I KNOWN SUCH FORCE TO DWELL IN THE GLANCE OF ANY HUMAN EYE AS DWELT IN THAT OF THIS UNCANNY BEING HIS SINGULAR AFFLICTION IF AFFLICTION IT WERE THE FILM OR SLIGHT MEMBRANE WHICH SOMETIMES OBSCURED THE OBLIQUE EYES
4234-187738-0003 WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT AT THE MOMENT THAT I CROSSED THE THRESHOLD BUT NOW AS I LOOKED UP AT DOCTOR FU MANCHU IT LIFTED REVEALING THE EYES IN ALL THEIR EMERALD GREENNESS THE IDEA OF PHYSICAL ATTACK UPON THIS INCREDIBLE BEING SEEMED CHILDISH
4234-187738-0004 INADEQUATE BUT FOLLOWING THAT FIRST INSTANT OF STUPEFACTION I FORCED MYSELF TO ADVANCE UPON HIM A DULL CRUSHING BLOW DESCENDED ON THE TOP OF MY SKULL AND I BECAME OBLIVIOUS OF ALL THINGS
4234-187738-0005 THIS AWAKENING WAS ACCOMPANIED BY NONE OF THOSE HAZY DOUBTS RESPECTING PREVIOUS EVENTS AND PRESENT SURROUNDINGS WHICH ARE THE USUAL SYMPTOMS OF REVIVAL FROM SUDDEN UNCONSCIOUSNESS EVEN BEFORE I OPENED MY EYES BEFORE I HAD MORE THAN A PARTIAL COMMAND OF MY SENSES
4234-187738-0006 I KNEW THAT WITH MY WRISTS HANDCUFFED BEHIND ME I LAY IN A ROOM WHICH WAS ALSO OCCUPIED BY DOCTOR FU MANCHU THIS ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY OF THE CHINAMAN'S PRESENCE WAS EVIDENCED NOT BY MY SENSES
4234-187738-0007 BUT ONLY BY AN INNER CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SAME THAT ALWAYS AWOKE INTO LIFE AT THE APPROACH NOT ONLY OF FU MANCHU IN PERSON BUT OF CERTAIN OF HIS UNCANNY SERVANTS A FAINT PERFUME HUNG IN THE AIR ABOUT ME
4234-187738-0008 I DO NOT MEAN THAT OF ANY ESSENCE OR OF ANY INCENSE BUT RATHER THE SMELL WHICH IS SUFFUSED BY ORIENTAL FURNITURE BY ORIENTAL DRAPERIES THE INDEFINABLE BUT UNMISTAKABLE PERFUME OF THE EAST
4234-187738-0009 WHILST THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARSEILLES AND SUEZ FOR INSTANCE IS EVEN MORE MARKED NOW THE ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDING ME WAS EASTERN BUT NOT OF THE EAST THAT I KNEW RATHER IT WAS FAR EASTERN
4234-187738-0010 PERHAPS I DO NOT MAKE MYSELF VERY CLEAR BUT TO ME THERE WAS A MYSTERIOUS SIGNIFICANCE IN THAT PERFUMED ATMOSPHERE I OPENED MY EYES
4234-187738-0011 I LAY UPON A LONG LOW SETTEE IN A FAIRLY LARGE ROOM WHICH WAS FURNISHED AS I HAD ANTICIPATED IN AN ABSOLUTELY ORIENTAL FASHION THE TWO WINDOWS WERE SO SCREENED AS TO HAVE LOST FROM THE INTERIOR POINT OF VIEW ALL RESEMBLANCE TO EUROPEAN WINDOWS
4234-187738-0012 THE END IN WHICH I LAY WAS AS I HAVE SAID TYPICAL OF AN EASTERN HOUSE AND A LARGE ORNATE LANTERN HUNG FROM THE CEILING ALMOST DIRECTLY ABOVE ME THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM WAS OCCUPIED BY TALL CASES
4234-187738-0013 SOME OF THEM CONTAINING BOOKS BUT THE MAJORITY FILLED WITH SCIENTIFIC PARAPHERNALIA ROWS OF FLASKS AND JARS FRAMES OF TEST TUBES RETORTS SCALES
4234-187738-0014 AT A LARGE AND VERY FINELY CARVED TABLE SAT DOCTOR FU MANCHU A YELLOW AND FADED VOLUME OPEN BEFORE HIM
4234-187738-0015 BUBBLING IN A TEST TUBE WHICH HE HELD OVER THE FLAME OF A BUNSEN BURNER
4234-187738-0016 DIVIDING HIS ATTENTION BETWEEN THE VOLUME THE CONTENTS OF THE TEST TUBE AND THE PROGRESS OF A SECOND EXPERIMENT OR POSSIBLY A PART OF THE SAME WHICH WAS TAKING PLACE UPON ANOTHER CORNER OF THE LITTERED TABLE
4234-187738-0017 A HUGE GLASS RETORT THE BULB WAS FULLY TWO FEET IN DIAMETER FITTED WITH A LIEBIG'S CONDENSER RESTED IN A METAL FRAME AND WITHIN THE BULB FLOATING IN AN OILY SUBSTANCE WAS A FUNGUS SOME SIX INCHES HIGH
4234-187738-0018 SHAPED LIKE A TOADSTOOL BUT OF A BRILLIANT AND VENOMOUS ORANGE COLOR THREE FLAT TUBES OF LIGHT WERE SO ARRANGED AS TO CAST VIOLET RAYS UPWARD INTO THE RETORT AND THE RECEIVER WHEREIN CONDENSED THE PRODUCT OF THIS STRANGE EXPERIMENT
4234-187738-0019 COULD HAVE PRODUCED SUCH EFFECT UPON ME AS THOSE COLD AND CAREFULLY CALCULATED WORDS SPOKEN IN THAT UNIQUE VOICE WHICH RANG ABOUT THE ROOM SIBILANTLY IN ITS TONES IN THE GLANCE OF THE GREEN EYES IN THE VERY POSE OF THE GAUNT HIGH SHOULDERED BODY
4234-187738-0020 THERE WAS POWER FORCE I COUNTED MYSELF LOST AND IN VIEW OF THE DOCTOR'S WORDS STUDIED THE PROGRESS OF THE EXPERIMENT WITH FRIGHTFUL INTEREST BUT A FEW MOMENTS SUFFICED IN WHICH TO REALIZE THAT FOR ALL MY TRAINING I KNEW AS LITTLE OF CHEMISTRY
4234-187738-0021 OF CHEMISTRY AS UNDERSTOOD BY THIS MAN'S GENIUS AS A JUNIOR STUDENT IN SURGERY KNOWS OF TREPHINING
4234-187738-0022 THUS IN THE HEAVY SILENCE OF THAT ROOM A SILENCE ONLY BROKEN BY THE REGULAR BUBBLING FROM THE TEST TUBE I FOUND MY ATTENTION STRAYING FROM THE TABLE TO THE OTHER OBJECTS SURROUNDING IT AND AT ONE OF THEM MY GAZE STOPPED AND REMAINED CHAINED WITH HORROR
4234-187738-0023 IT WAS A GLASS JAR SOME FIVE FEET IN HEIGHT AND FILLED WITH VISCOUS FLUID OF A LIGHT AMBER COLOR OUT FROM THIS PEERED A HIDEOUS DOG LIKE FACE LOW BROWED WITH POINTED EARS AND A NOSE ALMOST HOGGISHLY FLAT
4234-187738-0024 BY THE DEATH GRIN OF THE FACE THE GLEAMING FANGS WERE REVEALED AND THE BODY THE LONG YELLOW GRAY BODY RESTED OR SEEMED TO REST UPON SHORT MALFORMED LEGS WHILST ONE LONG LIMP ARM THE RIGHT
4234-187738-0025 HUNG DOWN STRAIGHTLY IN THE PRESERVATIVE THE LEFT ARM HAD BEEN SEVERED ABOVE THE ELBOW FU MANCHU FINDING HIS EXPERIMENT TO BE PROCEEDING FAVORABLY LIFTED HIS EYES TO ME AGAIN
4234-187738-0026 AND HIS EYES WERE FILMED LIKE THE EYES OF ONE AFFLICTED WITH CATARACT HE WAS A DEVOTED SERVANT DOCTOR PETRIE BUT THE LOWER INFLUENCES IN HIS GENEALOGY SOMETIMES CONQUERED THEN HE GOT OUT OF HAND
4234-187738-0027 THAT IN ONE OF THOSE PAROXYSMS OF HIS HE ATTACKED AND KILLED A MOST FAITHFUL BURMAN ONE OF MY OLDEST FOLLOWERS FU MANCHU RETURNED TO HIS EXPERIMENT
4234-187738-0028 THE HORROR OF THE THING WAS PLAYING HAVOC WITH MY OWN COMPOSURE HOWEVER THERE I LAY FETTERED IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THIS MAN WHOSE EXISTENCE WAS A MENACE TO THE ENTIRE WHITE RACE WHILST PLACIDLY HE PURSUED AN EXPERIMENT DESIGNED IF HIS OWN WORDS WERE BELIEVABLE
4234-187738-0029 SOMETHING I KNEW OF THE HISTORY OF THAT GHASTLY SPECIMEN THAT THING NEITHER MAN NOR APE FOR WITHIN MY OWN KNOWLEDGE HAD IT NOT ATTEMPTED THE LIFE OF NAYLAND SMITH AND WAS IT NOT I WHO WITH AN AX HAD MAIMED IT IN THE INSTANT OF ONE OF ITS LAST SLAYINGS
4234-187738-0030 I SOUGHT FURTIVELY TO MOVE MY ARMS ONLY TO REALIZE THAT AS I HAD ANTICIPATED THE HANDCUFFS WERE CHAINED TO A RING IN THE WALL BEHIND ME THE ESTABLISHMENTS OF DOCTOR FU MANCHU WERE ALWAYS WELL PROVIDED WITH SUCH CONTRIVANCES AS THESE
4234-187738-0031 I UTTERED A SHORT HARSH LAUGH FU MANCHU STOOD UP SLOWLY FROM THE TABLE AND PLACING THE TEST TUBE IN A RACK STOOD THE LATTER CAREFULLY UPON A SHELF AT HIS SIDE
4234-187738-0032 AND IN MY ABSENCE THAT PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY OF WHICH I HAVE HAD EVIDENCE IN THE PAST WILL
4234-187738-0033 AT SOME FUTURE TIME POSSIBLY WHEN YOU ARE MY GUEST IN CHINA
4234-187738-0034 FUNGUS HE WALKED QUIETLY TO A CURTAINED DOORWAY WITH HIS CAT LIKE YET AWKWARD GAIT LIFTED THE DRAPERY AND WITH A SLIGHT NOD IN MY DIRECTION
