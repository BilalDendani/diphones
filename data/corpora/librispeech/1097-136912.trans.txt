1097-136912-0000 OR TO TAKE A CRUISE ROUND THE WORLD IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE EVER WAS A BOX WHICH WAS OPENED AND SHUT SO MANY TIMES WITHIN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AS THAT WHICH CONTAINED HIS WARDROBE AND NECESSARIES AND CERTAINLY
1097-136912-0001 THERE NEVER WAS ONE WHICH TO TWO SMALL EYES PRESENTED SUCH A MINE OF CLOTHING AS THIS MIGHTY CHEST WITH ITS THREE SHIRTS AND PROPORTIONATE ALLOWANCE OF STOCKINGS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS DISCLOSED TO THE ASTONISHED VISION OF LITTLE JACOB
1097-136912-0002 AT LAST IT WAS CONVEYED TO THE CARRIER'S AT WHOSE HOUSE AT FINCHLEY KIT WAS TO FIND IT NEXT DAY AND THE BOX BEING GONE THERE REMAINED BUT TWO QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION FIRSTLY WHETHER THE CARRIER WOULD LOSE
1097-136912-0003 OR DISHONESTLY FEIGN TO LOSE THE BOX UPON THE ROAD SECONDLY WHETHER KIT'S MOTHER PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF IN THE ABSENCE OF HER SON I DON'T THINK THERE'S HARDLY A CHANCE OF HIS REALLY LOSING IT
1097-136912-0004 BUT CARRIERS ARE UNDER GREAT TEMPTATION TO PRETEND THEY LOSE THINGS NO DOUBT SAID MISSUS NUBBLES APPREHENSIVELY IN REFERENCE TO THE FIRST POINT NO DOUBT ABOUT IT RETURNED KIT WITH A SERIOUS LOOK UPON MY WORD MOTHER
1097-136912-0005 I DON'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT TO TRUST IT TO ITSELF SOMEBODY OUGHT TO HAVE GONE WITH IT I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T HELP IT NOW SAID HIS MOTHER BUT IT WAS FOOLISH AND WRONG PEOPLE OUGHTN'T TO BE TEMPTED
1097-136912-0006 KIT INWARDLY RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD NEVER TEMPT A CARRIER ANY MORE SAVE WITH AN EMPTY BOX AND HAVING FORMED THIS CHRISTIAN DETERMINATION HE TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO THE SECOND QUESTION YOU KNOW YOU MUST KEEP UP YOUR SPIRITS MOTHER AND NOT BE LONESOME BECAUSE I'M NOT AT HOME
1097-136912-0007 SAID MISSUS NUBBLES I KNOW WHO HAS BEEN PUTTING THAT IN YOUR HEAD REJOINED HER SON DISCONSOLATELY THAT'S LITTLE BETHEL AGAIN NOW I SAY MOTHER
1097-136912-0008 PRAY DON'T TAKE TO GOING THERE REGULARLY FOR IF I WAS TO SEE YOUR GOOD HUMOURED FACE THAT HAS ALWAYS MADE HOME CHEERFUL TURNED INTO A GRIEVOUS ONE AND THE BABY TRAINED TO LOOK GRIEVOUS TOO AND TO CALL ITSELF A YOUNG SINNER BLESS ITS HEART AND A CHILD OF THE DEVIL
1097-136912-0009 WHICH IS CALLING ITS DEAD FATHER NAMES IF I WAS TO SEE THIS AND SEE LITTLE JACOB LOOKING GRIEVOUS LIKEWISE I SHOULD SO TAKE IT TO HEART THAT I'M SURE I SHOULD GO AND LIST FOR A SOLDIER AND RUN MY HEAD ON PURPOSE AGAINST THE FIRST CANNON BALL I SAW COMING MY WAY
1097-136912-0010 OH KIT DON'T TALK LIKE THAT I WOULD INDEED MOTHER AND UNLESS YOU WANT TO MAKE ME FEEL VERY WRETCHED AND UNCOMFORTABLE YOU'LL KEEP THAT BOW ON YOUR BONNET WHICH YOU'D MORE THAN HALF A MIND TO PULL OFF LAST WEEK
1097-136912-0011 WHICH CALLS UPON ME TO BE A SNIVELLING SOLEMN WHISPERING CHAP SNEAKING ABOUT AS IF I COULDN'T HELP IT AND EXPRESSING MYSELF IN A MOST UNPLEASANT SNUFFLE ON THE CONTRARY DON'T I SEE EVERY REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T JUST HEAR THIS HA HA HA
1097-136912-0012 AN'T THAT AS NAT'RAL AS WALKING AND AS GOOD FOR THE HEALTH HA HA HA AN'T THAT AS NAT'RAL AS A SHEEP'S BLEATING OR A PIG'S GRUNTING OR A HORSE'S NEIGHING OR A BIRD'S SINGING HA HA HA ISN'T IT MOTHER THERE WAS SOMETHING CONTAGIOUS IN KIT'S LAUGH
1097-136912-0013 FOR HIS MOTHER WHO HAD LOOKED GRAVE BEFORE FIRST SUBSIDED INTO A SMILE AND THEN FELL TO JOINING IN IT HEARTILY WHICH OCCASIONED KIT TO SAY THAT HE KNEW IT WAS NATURAL AND TO LAUGH THE MORE KIT AND HIS MOTHER LAUGHING TOGETHER IN A PRETTY LOUD KEY
1097-136912-0014 WOKE THE BABY WHO FINDING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY JOVIAL AND AGREEABLE IN PROGRESS WAS NO SOONER IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS THAN IT BEGAN TO KICK AND LAUGH MOST VIGOROUSLY THIS NEW ILLUSTRATION OF HIS ARGUMENT SO TICKLED KIT
1097-136912-0015 THAT HE FELL BACKWARD IN HIS CHAIR IN A STATE OF EXHAUSTION
1097-136912-0016 AFTER RECOVERING TWICE OR THRICE
1097-136912-0017 AND A VERY CHEERFUL MEAL THEIR SCANTY SUPPER WAS WITH MORE KISSES AND HUGS AND TEARS THAN MANY YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHO START UPON THEIR TRAVELS AND LEAVE WELL STOCKED HOMES BEHIND THEM WOULD DEEM WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF PROBABILITY
1097-136912-0018 IF MATTER SO LOW COULD BE HEREIN SET DOWN KIT LEFT THE HOUSE AT AN EARLY HOUR NEXT MORNING AND SET OUT TO WALK TO FINCHLEY FEELING A SUFFICIENT PRIDE IN HIS APPEARANCE TO HAVE WARRANTED HIS EXCOMMUNICATION FROM LITTLE BETHEL FROM THAT TIME FORTH
1097-136912-0019 IF HE HAD EVER BEEN ONE OF THAT MOURNFUL CONGREGATION LEST ANYBODY SHOULD FEEL A CURIOSITY TO KNOW HOW KIT WAS CLAD IT MAY BE BRIEFLY REMARKED THAT HE WORE NO LIVERY BUT WAS DRESSED IN A COAT OF PEPPER AND SALT WITH WAISTCOAT OF CANARY COLOUR
1097-136912-0020 AND NETHER GARMENTS OF IRON GREY BESIDES THESE GLORIES HE SHONE IN THE LUSTRE OF A NEW PAIR OF BOOTS AND AN EXTREMELY STIFF AND SHINY HAT WHICH ON BEING STRUCK ANYWHERE WITH THE KNUCKLES SOUNDED LIKE A DRUM AND IN THIS ATTIRE
1097-136912-0021 RATHER WONDERING THAT HE ATTRACTED SO LITTLE ATTENTION AND ATTRIBUTING THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE INSENSIBILITY OF THOSE WHO GOT UP EARLY HE MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS ABEL COTTAGE WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING ANY MORE REMARKABLE ADVENTURE ON THE ROAD
1097-136912-0022 THAN MEETING A LAD IN A BRIMLESS HAT THE EXACT COUNTERPART OF HIS OLD ONE ON WHOM HE BESTOWED HALF THE SIXPENCE HE POSSESSED KIT ARRIVED IN COURSE OF TIME AT THE CARRIER'S HOUSE WHERE TO THE LASTING HONOUR OF HUMAN NATURE
1097-136912-0023 HE FOUND THE BOX IN SAFETY RECEIVING FROM THE WIFE OF THIS IMMACULATE MAN A DIRECTION TO MISTER GARLAND'S HE TOOK THE BOX UPON HIS SHOULDER AND REPAIRED THITHER DIRECTLY TO BE SURE
1097-136912-0024 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE COTTAGE WITH A THATCHED ROOF AND LITTLE SPIRES AT THE GABLE ENDS AND PIECES OF STAINED GLASS IN SOME OF THE WINDOWS ALMOST AS LARGE AS POCKET BOOKS ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS A LITTLE STABLE
1097-136912-0025 JUST THE SIZE FOR THE PONY WITH A LITTLE ROOM OVER IT JUST THE SIZE FOR KIT WHITE CURTAINS WERE FLUTTERING AND BIRDS IN CAGES THAT LOOKED AS BRIGHT AS IF THEY WERE MADE OF GOLD WERE SINGING AT THE WINDOWS PLANTS WERE ARRANGED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PATH
1097-136912-0026 AND CLUSTERED ABOUT THE DOOR AND THE GARDEN WAS BRIGHT WITH FLOWERS IN FULL BLOOM WHICH SHED A SWEET ODOUR ALL ROUND AND HAD A CHARMING AND ELEGANT APPEARANCE EVERYTHING WITHIN THE HOUSE AND WITHOUT
1097-136912-0027 SEEMED TO BE THE PERFECTION OF NEATNESS AND ORDER IN THE GARDEN THERE WAS NOT A WEED TO BE SEEN AND TO JUDGE FROM SOME DAPPER GARDENING TOOLS A BASKET AND A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH WERE LYING IN ONE OF THE WALKS
1097-136912-0028 OLD MISTER GARLAND HAD BEEN AT WORK IN IT THAT VERY MORNING KIT LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND ADMIRED AND LOOKED AGAIN AND THIS A GREAT MANY TIMES BEFORE HE COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO TURN HIS HEAD ANOTHER WAY AND RING THE BELL
1097-136912-0029 BUT AT LAST AS HE WAS SITTING UPON THE BOX THINKING ABOUT GIANTS CASTLES AND PRINCESSES TIED UP TO PEGS BY THE HAIR OF THEIR HEADS AND DRAGONS BURSTING OUT FROM BEHIND GATES AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE LIKE NATURE
1097-136912-0030 COMMON IN STORY BOOKS TO YOUTHS OF LOW DEGREE ON THEIR FIRST VISIT TO STRANGE HOUSES THE DOOR WAS GENTLY OPENED AND A LITTLE SERVANT GIRL VERY TIDY MODEST AND DEMURE BUT VERY PRETTY TOO APPEARED I SUPPOSE YOU'RE CHRISTOPHER SIR
1097-136912-0031 SAID THE SERVANT GIRL KIT GOT OFF THE BOX AND SAID YES HE WAS I'M AFRAID YOU'VE RUNG A GOOD MANY TIMES PERHAPS SHE REJOINED BUT WE COULDN'T HEAR YOU BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN CATCHING THE PONY
1097-136912-0032 KIT RATHER WONDERED WHAT THIS MEANT BUT AS HE COULDN'T STOP THERE ASKING QUESTIONS HE SHOULDERED THE BOX AGAIN AND FOLLOWED THE GIRL INTO THE HALL WHERE THROUGH A BACK DOOR HE DESCRIED MISTER GARLAND LEADING WHISKER IN TRIUMPH UP THE GARDEN
1097-136912-0033 AFTER THAT SELF WILLED PONY HAD AS HE AFTERWARDS LEARNED DODGED THE FAMILY ROUND A SMALL PADDOCK IN THE REAR FOR ONE HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE OLD GENTLEMAN RECEIVED HIM VERY KINDLY AND SO DID THE OLD LADY
1097-136912-0034 WHOSE PREVIOUS GOOD OPINION OF HIM WAS GREATLY ENHANCED BY HIS WIPING HIS BOOTS ON THE MAT UNTIL THE SOLES OF HIS FEET BURNT AGAIN HE WAS THEN TAKEN INTO THE PARLOUR TO BE INSPECTED IN HIS NEW CLOTHES AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN SURVEYED SEVERAL TIMES
1097-136912-0035 AND HAD AFFORDED BY HIS APPEARANCE UNLIMITED SATISFACTION HE WAS TAKEN INTO THE STABLE WHERE THE PONY RECEIVED HIM WITH UNCOMMON COMPLAISANCE AND THENCE INTO THE LITTLE CHAMBER HE HAD ALREADY OBSERVED WHICH WAS VERY CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE AND THENCE INTO THE GARDEN
1097-136912-0036 THAT THE BRIM SUFFERED CONSIDERABLY WHEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD SAID ALL HE HAD TO SAY IN THE WAY OF PROMISE AND ADVICE AND KIT HAD SAID ALL HE HAD TO SAY IN THE WAY OF ASSURANCE AND THANKFULNESS HE WAS HANDED OVER AGAIN TO THE OLD LADY
1097-136912-0037 WITH EVERYTHING IN IT AS BRIGHT AND GLOWING AND AS PRECISELY ORDERED TOO AS BARBARA HERSELF
1097-136912-0038 TO EAT COLD MEAT AND DRINK SMALL ALE AND USE HIS KNIFE AND FORK THE MORE AWKWARDLY BECAUSE THERE WAS AN UNKNOWN BARBARA LOOKING ON AND OBSERVING HIM IT DID NOT APPEAR HOWEVER
1097-136912-0039 THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING REMARKABLY TREMENDOUS ABOUT THIS STRANGE BARBARA WHO HAVING LIVED A VERY QUIET LIFE BLUSHED VERY MUCH AND WAS QUITE AS EMBARRASSED AND UNCERTAIN WHAT SHE OUGHT TO SAY OR DO AS KIT COULD POSSIBLY BE WHEN HE HAD SAT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
1097-136912-0040 ATTENTIVE TO THE TICKING OF THE SOBER CLOCK HE VENTURED TO GLANCE CURIOUSLY AT THE DRESSER AND THERE AMONG THE PLATES AND DISHES WERE BARBARA'S LITTLE WORK BOX WITH A SLIDING LID TO SHUT IN THE BALLS OF COTTON AND BARBARA'S PRAYER BOOK AND BARBARA'S HYMN BOOK
1097-136912-0041 AND BARBARA'S BIBLE BARBARA'S LITTLE LOOKING GLASS HUNG IN A GOOD LIGHT NEAR THE WINDOW AND BARBARA'S BONNET WAS ON A NAIL BEHIND THE DOOR FROM ALL THESE MUTE SIGNS AND TOKENS OF HER PRESENCE HE NATURALLY GLANCED AT BARBARA HERSELF
1097-136912-0042 WHO SAT AS MUTE AS THEY SHELLING PEAS INTO A DISH AND JUST WHEN KIT WAS LOOKING AT HER EYELASHES AND WONDERING QUITE IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART WHAT COLOUR HER EYES MIGHT BE
