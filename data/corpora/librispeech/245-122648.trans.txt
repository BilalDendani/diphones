245-122648-0000 EVEN SINGLY OUR WAVE GIRT LAND
245-122648-0001 THE HAY WAS ALL GOT IN THE FIELDS ROUND THORNFIELD WERE GREEN AND SHORN THE ROADS WHITE AND BAKED THE TREES WERE IN THEIR DARK PRIME HEDGE AND WOOD
245-122648-0002 FULL LEAVED AND DEEPLY TINTED CONTRASTED WELL WITH THE SUNNY HUE OF THE CLEARED MEADOWS BETWEEN ON MIDSUMMER EVE ADELE
245-122648-0003 WEARY WITH GATHERING WILD STRAWBERRIES IN HAY LANE HALF THE DAY HAD GONE TO BED WITH THE SUN I WATCHED HER DROP ASLEEP AND WHEN I LEFT HER I SOUGHT THE GARDEN IT WAS NOW
245-122648-0004 THE SWEETEST HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR DAY ITS FERVID FIRES HAD WASTED AND DEW FELL COOL ON PANTING PLAIN AND SCORCHED SUMMIT
245-122648-0005 AND FURNACE FLAME AT ONE POINT ON ONE HILL PEAK AND EXTENDING HIGH AND WIDE SOFT AND STILL
245-122648-0006 HANDBREADTH I KNEW I MIGHT BE WATCHED THENCE SO I WENT APART INTO THE ORCHARD
245-122648-0007 AND MORE EDEN LIKE IT WAS FULL OF TREES IT BLOOMED WITH FLOWERS A VERY HIGH WALL SHUT IT OUT FROM THE COURT ON ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER A BEECH AVENUE SCREENED IT FROM THE LAWN
245-122648-0008 AT THE BOTTOM WAS A SUNK FENCE
245-122648-0009 ITS SOLE SEPARATION FROM LONELY FIELDS A WINDING WALK BORDERED WITH LAURELS AND TERMINATING IN A GIANT HORSE CHESTNUT CIRCLED AT THE BASE BY A SEAT LED DOWN TO THE FENCE HERE ONE COULD WANDER UNSEEN
245-122648-0010 WHILE SUCH HONEY DEW FELL SUCH SILENCE REIGNED SUCH GLOAMING GATHERED I FELT AS IF I COULD HAUNT SUCH SHADE FOR EVER
245-122648-0011 BUT IN THREADING THE FLOWER AND FRUIT PARTERRES AT THE UPPER PART OF THE ENCLOSURE ENTICED THERE BY THE LIGHT THE NOW RISING MOON CAST ON THIS MORE OPEN QUARTER MY STEP
245-122648-0012 IT IS MISTER ROCHESTER'S CIGAR I LOOK ROUND AND I LISTEN I SEE TREES LADEN WITH RIPENING FRUIT I HEAR A NIGHTINGALE
245-122648-0013 WARBLING IN A WOOD HALF A MILE OFF NO MOVING FORM IS VISIBLE NO COMING STEP
245-122648-0014 BUT THAT PERFUME INCREASES I MUST FLEE I MAKE FOR THE WICKET LEADING TO THE SHRUBBERY AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERING
245-122648-0015 I STEP ASIDE INTO THE IVY RECESS HE WILL NOT STAY LONG HE WILL SOON RETURN WHENCE HE CAME AND IF I SIT STILL HE WILL NEVER SEE ME BUT NO
245-122648-0016 EVENTIDE IS AS PLEASANT TO HIM AS TO ME AND THIS ANTIQUE GARDEN AS ATTRACTIVE AND HE STROLLS ON
245-122648-0017 NOW LIFTING THE GOOSEBERRY TREE BRANCHES TO LOOK AT THE FRUIT LARGE AS PLUMS WITH WHICH THEY ARE LADEN NOW TAKING A RIPE CHERRY FROM THE WALL
245-122648-0018 NOW STOOPING TOWARDS A KNOT OF FLOWERS EITHER TO INHALE THEIR FRAGRANCE OR TO ADMIRE THE DEW BEADS ON THEIR PETALS A GREAT MOTH GOES HUMMING BY ME
245-122648-0019 IT ALIGHTS ON A PLANT AT MISTER ROCHESTER'S FOOT HE SEES IT AND BENDS TO EXAMINE IT NOW HE HAS HIS BACK TOWARDS ME THOUGHT I AND HE IS OCCUPIED TOO
245-122648-0020 PERHAPS IF I WALK SOFTLY I CAN SLIP AWAY UNNOTICED I TRODE ON AN EDGING OF TURF THAT THE CRACKLE OF THE PEBBLY GRAVEL MIGHT NOT BETRAY ME
245-122648-0021 HE WAS STANDING AMONG THE BEDS AT A YARD OR TWO DISTANT FROM WHERE I HAD TO PASS THE MOTH APPARENTLY ENGAGED HIM I SHALL GET BY VERY WELL I MEDITATED
245-122648-0022 I HAD MADE NO NOISE HE HAD NOT EYES BEHIND COULD HIS SHADOW FEEL I STARTED AT FIRST AND THEN I APPROACHED HIM
