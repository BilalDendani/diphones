6224-34608-0000 AND A CERTAIN SURVEILLANCE IS WISE JOSIANA HAD LORD DAVID WATCHED BY A LITTLE CREATURE OF HERS IN WHOM SHE REPOSED CONFIDENCE AND WHOSE NAME WAS BARKILPHEDRO
6224-34608-0001 LORD DAVID HAD JOSIANA DISCREETLY OBSERVED BY A CREATURE OF HIS OF WHOM HE WAS SURE AND WHOSE NAME WAS BARKILPHEDRO QUEEN ANNE
6224-34608-0002 ON HER PART KEPT HERSELF SECRETLY INFORMED OF THE ACTIONS AND CONDUCT OF THE DUCHESS JOSIANA HER BASTARD SISTER AND OF LORD DAVID HER FUTURE BROTHER IN LAW BY THE LEFT HAND BY A CREATURE OF HERS ON WHOM SHE COUNTED FULLY
6224-34608-0003 AND WHOSE NAME WAS BARKILPHEDRO THIS BARKILPHEDRO HAD HIS FINGERS ON THAT KEYBOARD JOSIANA LORD DAVID A QUEEN A MAN BETWEEN TWO WOMEN
6224-34608-0004 WHAT MODULATIONS POSSIBLE WHAT AMALGAMATION OF SOULS
6224-34608-0005 HE WAS AN OLD SERVANT OF THE DUKE OF YORK HE HAD TRIED TO BE A CHURCHMAN BUT HAD FAILED THE DUKE OF YORK AN ENGLISH AND A ROMAN PRINCE COMPOUNDED OF ROYAL POPERY AND LEGAL ANGLICANISM
6224-34608-0006 HAD HIS CATHOLIC HOUSE AND HIS PROTESTANT HOUSE AND MIGHT HAVE PUSHED BARKILPHEDRO IN ONE OR THE OTHER HIERARCHY BUT HE DID NOT JUDGE HIM TO BE CATHOLIC ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM ALMONER
6224-34608-0007 SO THAT BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS BARKILPHEDRO FOUND HIMSELF WITH HIS SOUL ON THE GROUND NOT A BAD POSTURE EITHER FOR CERTAIN REPTILE SOULS CERTAIN WAYS ARE IMPRACTICABLE
6224-34608-0008 EXCEPT BY CRAWLING FLAT ON THE BELLY AN OBSCURE BUT FATTENING SERVITUDE HAD LONG MADE UP BARKILPHEDRO'S WHOLE EXISTENCE SERVICE IS SOMETHING BUT HE WANTED POWER BESIDES
6224-34608-0009 HE HAD TO BEGIN ALL OVER AGAIN NOTHING TO DO UNDER WILLIAM THE THIRD A SULLEN PRINCE AND EXERCISING IN HIS MODE OF REIGNING A PRUDERY WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE PROBITY BARKILPHEDRO
6224-34608-0010 DID NOT LAPSE ALL AT ONCE INTO RAGS THERE IS A SOMETHING WHICH SURVIVES DEPOSED PRINCES AND WHICH FEEDS AND SUSTAINS THEIR PARASITES
6224-34608-0011 THEN ALL AT ONCE THE LEAF YELLOWS AND DRIES UP AND THUS IT IS WITH THE COURTIER THANKS TO THAT EMBALMING WHICH IS CALLED LEGITIMACY THE PRINCE HIMSELF
6224-34608-0012 ALTHOUGH FALLEN AND CAST AWAY LASTS AND KEEPS PRESERVED IT IS NOT SO WITH THE COURTIER MUCH MORE DEAD THAN THE KING THE KING BEYOND THERE IS A MUMMY THE COURTIER HERE
6224-34608-0013 IS A PHANTOM TO BE THE SHADOW OF A SHADOW IS LEANNESS INDEED HENCE BARKILPHEDRO BECAME FAMISHED THEN HE TOOK UP THE CHARACTER OF A MAN OF LETTERS
6224-34608-0014 BUT HE WAS THRUST BACK EVEN FROM THE KITCHENS SOMETIMES HE KNEW NOT WHERE TO SLEEP WHO WILL GIVE ME SHELTER HE WOULD ASK HE STRUGGLED ON ALL THAT IS INTERESTING IN PATIENCE IN DISTRESS
6224-34608-0015 OF OLD MEMORIES OF FABLES OF FIDELITY OF TOUCHING STORIES HE PIERCED AS FAR AS THE DUCHESS JOSIANA'S HEART JOSIANA TOOK A LIKING TO THIS MAN OF POVERTY AND WIT
6224-34608-0016 AN INTERESTING COMBINATION SHE PRESENTED HIM TO LORD DIRRY MOIR GAVE HIM A SHELTER IN THE SERVANTS HALL AMONG HER DOMESTICS RETAINED HIM IN HER HOUSEHOLD WAS KIND TO HIM AND SOMETIMES EVEN SPOKE TO HIM
6224-34608-0017 BARKILPHEDRO FELT NEITHER HUNGER NOR COLD AGAIN JOSIANA ADDRESSED HIM IN THE SECOND PERSON IT WAS THE FASHION FOR GREAT LADIES TO DO SO TO MEN OF LETTERS
6224-34608-0018 N'EST TU PAS LA CHABOT FOR BARKILPHEDRO
6224-34608-0019 WAS A SUCCESS HE WAS OVERJOYED BY IT HE HAD ASPIRED TO THIS CONTEMPTUOUS FAMILIARITY LADY JOSIANA THEES AND THOUS ME HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF AND HE WOULD RUB HIS HANDS
6224-34608-0020 TO MAKE FURTHER WAY HE BECAME A SORT OF CONSTANT ATTENDANT IN JOSIANA'S PRIVATE ROOMS IN NO WAY TROUBLESOME UNPERCEIVED THE DUCHESS WOULD ALMOST HAVE CHANGED HER SHIFT BEFORE HIM ALL THIS HOWEVER WAS PRECARIOUS
6224-34608-0021 BARKILPHEDRO WAS AIMING AT A POSITION A DUCHESS WAS HALF WAY AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE WHICH DID NOT LEAD TO THE QUEEN WAS HAVING BORED FOR NOTHING ONE DAY BARKILPHEDRO SAID TO JOSIANA
