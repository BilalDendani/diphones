3006-5697-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE PECUNIARY STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE GREAT BODY OF THE PEOPLE IN ANY MODERN COMMUNITY THE PROXIMATE GROUND OF EXPENDITURE IN EXCESS OF WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR PHYSICAL COMFORT
3006-5697-0001 IS NOT A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO EXCEL IN THE EXPENSIVENESS OF THEIR VISIBLE CONSUMPTION SO MUCH AS IT IS A DESIRE TO LIVE UP TO THE CONVENTIONAL STANDARD OF DECENCY IN THE AMOUNT AND GRADE OF GOODS CONSUMED THIS DESIRE IS NOT GUIDED BY A RIGIDLY INVARIABLE STANDARD
3006-5697-0002 WHICH MUST BE LIVED UP TO AND BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO GO THE STANDARD IS FLEXIBLE AND ESPECIALLY IT IS INDEFINITELY EXTENSIBLE IF ONLY TIME IS ALLOWED FOR HABITUATION TO ANY INCREASE IN PECUNIARY ABILITY
3006-5697-0003 AND FOR ACQUIRING FACILITY IN THE NEW AND LARGER SCALE OF EXPENDITURE THAT FOLLOWS SUCH AN INCREASE IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO RECEDE FROM A SCALE OF EXPENDITURE ONCE ADOPTED
3006-5697-0004 IT IS QUITE AS HARD TO GIVE UP THESE AS IT IS TO GIVE UP MANY ITEMS THAT CONDUCE DIRECTLY TO ONE'S PHYSICAL COMFORT OR EVEN THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO LIFE AND HEALTH THAT IS TO SAY THE CONSPICUOUSLY WASTEFUL HONORIFIC EXPENDITURE THAT CONFERS SPIRITUAL WELL BEING
3006-5697-0005 MAY BECOME MORE INDISPENSABLE THAN MUCH OF THAT EXPENDITURE WHICH MINISTERS TO THE LOWER WANTS OF PHYSICAL WELL BEING OR SUSTENANCE ONLY IT IS NOTORIOUSLY JUST AS DIFFICULT TO RECEDE FROM A HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING AS IT IS TO LOWER A STANDARD WHICH IS ALREADY RELATIVELY LOW
3006-5697-0006 ALTHOUGH IN THE FORMER CASE THE DIFFICULTY IS A MORAL ONE WHILE IN THE LATTER IT MAY INVOLVE A MATERIAL DEDUCTION FROM THE PHYSICAL COMFORTS OF LIFE BUT WHILE RETROGRESSION IS DIFFICULT A FRESH ADVANCE IN CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE IS RELATIVELY EASY
3006-5697-0007 INDEED IT TAKES PLACE ALMOST AS A MATTER OF COURSE IN THE RARE CASES WHERE IT OCCURS A FAILURE TO INCREASE ONE'S VISIBLE CONSUMPTION WHEN THE MEANS FOR AN INCREASE ARE AT HAND IS FELT IN POPULAR APPREHENSION TO CALL FOR EXPLANATION
3006-5697-0008 AND UNWORTHY MOTIVES OF MISERLINESS ARE IMPUTED TO THOSE WHO FALL SHORT IN THIS RESPECT A PROMPT RESPONSE TO THE STIMULUS ON THE OTHER HAND IS ACCEPTED AS THE NORMAL EFFECT
3006-5697-0009 THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE STANDARD OF EXPENDITURE WHICH COMMONLY GUIDES OUR EFFORTS IS NOT THE AVERAGE ORDINARY EXPENDITURE ALREADY ACHIEVED IT IS AN IDEAL OF CONSUMPTION THAT LIES JUST BEYOND OUR REACH OR TO REACH WHICH REQUIRES SOME STRAIN
3006-5697-0010 THE MOTIVE IS EMULATION THE STIMULUS OF AN INVIDIOUS COMPARISON WHICH PROMPTS US TO OUTDO THOSE WITH WHOM WE ARE IN THE HABIT OF CLASSING OURSELVES
3006-5697-0011 IN THE SOCIAL SCALE WHILE IT RARELY COMPARES ITSELF WITH THOSE BELOW OR WITH THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERABLY IN ADVANCE THAT IS TO SAY IN OTHER WORDS OUR STANDARD OF DECENCY IN EXPENDITURE AS IN OTHER ENDS OF EMULATION
3006-5697-0012 IS SET BY THE USAGE OF THOSE NEXT ABOVE US IN REPUTABILITY UNTIL IN THIS WAY ESPECIALLY IN ANY COMMUNITY WHERE CLASS DISTINCTIONS ARE SOMEWHAT VAGUE ALL CANONS OF REPUTABILITY AND DECENCY AND ALL STANDARDS OF CONSUMPTION
3006-5697-0013 ARE TRACED BACK BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS TO THE USAGES AND HABITS OF THOUGHT OF THE HIGHEST SOCIAL AND PECUNIARY CLASS THE WEALTHY LEISURE CLASS IT IS FOR THIS CLASS TO DETERMINE IN GENERAL OUTLINE WHAT SCHEME OF LIFE THE COMMUNITY SHALL ACCEPT AS DECENT OR HONORIFIC
3006-5697-0014 AND IT IS THEIR OFFICE BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE TO SET FORTH THIS SCHEME OF SOCIAL SALVATION IN ITS HIGHEST IDEAL FORM BUT THE HIGHER LEISURE CLASS CAN EXERCISE THIS QUASI SACERDOTAL OFFICE ONLY UNDER CERTAIN MATERIAL LIMITATIONS
3006-5697-0015 THE CLASS CANNOT AT DISCRETION EFFECT A SUDDEN REVOLUTION OR REVERSAL OF THE POPULAR HABITS OF THOUGHT WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THESE CEREMONIAL REQUIREMENTS IT TAKES TIME FOR ANY CHANGE TO PERMEATE THE MASS AND CHANGE THE HABITUAL ATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE
3006-5697-0016 AND ESPECIALLY IT TAKES TIME TO CHANGE THE HABITS OF THOSE CLASSES THAT ARE SOCIALLY MORE REMOTE FROM THE RADIANT BODY THE PROCESS IS SLOWER WHERE THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS LESS OR WHERE THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE SEVERAL CLASSES ARE WIDER AND MORE ABRUPT
3006-5697-0017 BUT IF TIME BE ALLOWED THE SCOPE OF THE DISCRETION OF THE LEISURE CLASS AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF FORM AND DETAIL IN THE COMMUNITY'S SCHEME OF LIFE IS LARGE WHILE AS REGARDS THE SUBSTANTIAL PRINCIPLES OF REPUTABILITY THE CHANGES WHICH IT CAN EFFECT LIE WITHIN A NARROW MARGIN OF TOLERANCE
3006-5697-0018 ITS EXAMPLE AND PRECEPT CARRIES THE FORCE OF PRESCRIPTION FOR ALL CLASSES BELOW IT BUT IN WORKING OUT THE PRECEPTS WHICH ARE HANDED DOWN AS GOVERNING THE FORM AND METHOD OF REPUTABILITY IN SHAPING THE USAGES AND THE SPIRITUAL ATTITUDE OF THE LOWER CLASSES
3006-5697-0019 TEMPERED IN VARYING DEGREE BY THE INSTINCT OF WORKMANSHIP TO THOSE NORMS IS TO BE ADDED ANOTHER BROAD PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN NATURE THE PREDATORY ANIMUS WHICH IN POINT OF GENERALITY AND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTENT LIES BETWEEN THE TWO JUST NAMED
3006-5697-0020 THE EFFECT OF THE LATTER IN SHAPING THE ACCEPTED SCHEME OF LIFE IS YET TO BE DISCUSSED THE CANON OF REPUTABILITY THEN MUST ADAPT ITSELF TO THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES
3006-5697-0021 THE TRADITIONS AND THE DEGREE OF SPIRITUAL MATURITY OF THE PARTICULAR CLASS WHOSE SCHEME OF LIFE IT IS TO REGULATE IT IS ESPECIALLY TO BE NOTED THAT HOWEVER HIGH ITS AUTHORITY AND HOWEVER TRUE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF REPUTABILITY IT MAY HAVE BEEN AT ITS INCEPTION
3006-5697-0022 A SPECIFIC FORMAL OBSERVANCE CAN UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAINTAIN ITSELF IN FORCE IF WITH THE LAPSE OF TIME OR ON ITS TRANSMISSION TO A LOWER PECUNIARY CLASS IT IS FOUND TO RUN COUNTER TO THE ULTIMATE GROUND OF DECENCY AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES NAMELY
3006-5697-0023 SERVICEABILITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF AN INVIDIOUS COMPARISON IN PECUNIARY SUCCESS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THESE CANONS OF EXPENDITURE HAVE MUCH TO SAY IN DETERMINING THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR ANY COMMUNITY AND FOR ANY CLASS
3006-5697-0024 AND AS TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH THIS HIGHER NEED WILL DOMINATE A PEOPLE'S CONSUMPTION IN THIS RESPECT THE CONTROL EXERTED BY THE ACCEPTED STANDARD OF LIVING IS CHIEFLY OF A NEGATIVE CHARACTER
3006-5697-0025 IT ACTS ALMOST SOLELY TO PREVENT RECESSION FROM A SCALE OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE THAT HAS ONCE BECOME HABITUAL A STANDARD OF LIVING IS OF THE NATURE OF HABIT IT IS AN HABITUAL SCALE AND METHOD OF RESPONDING TO GIVEN STIMULI
3006-5697-0026 THE DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY OF RECEDING FROM AN ACCUSTOMED STANDARD IS THE DIFFICULTY OF BREAKING A HABIT THAT HAS ONCE BEEN FORMED THE RELATIVE FACILITY WITH WHICH AN ADVANCE IN THE STANDARD IS MADE MEANS THAT THE LIFE PROCESS IS A PROCESS OF UNFOLDING ACTIVITY
3006-5697-0027 AND THAT IT WILL READILY UNFOLD IN A NEW DIRECTION WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THE RESISTANCE TO SELF EXPRESSION DECREASES BUT WHEN THE HABIT OF EXPRESSION ALONG SUCH A GIVEN LINE OF LOW RESISTANCE HAS ONCE BEEN FORMED
3006-5697-0028 THE DISCHARGE WILL SEEK THE ACCUSTOMED OUTLET EVEN AFTER A CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHEREBY THE EXTERNAL RESISTANCE HAS APPRECIABLY RISEN THAT HEIGHTENED FACILITY OF EXPRESSION IN A GIVEN DIRECTION WHICH IS CALLED HABIT
3006-5697-0029 MAY OFFSET A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE RESISTANCE OFFERED BY EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE UNFOLDING OF LIFE IN THE GIVEN DIRECTION
3006-5697-0030 THERE IS AN APPRECIABLE DIFFERENCE IN POINT OF PERSISTENCE UNDER COUNTERACTING CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN POINT OF THE DEGREE OF IMPERATIVENESS WITH WHICH THE DISCHARGE SEEKS A GIVEN DIRECTION THAT IS TO SAY IN THE LANGUAGE OF CURRENT ECONOMIC THEORY
3006-5697-0031 WHILE MEN ARE RELUCTANT TO RETRENCH THEIR EXPENDITURES IN ANY DIRECTION THEY ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO RETRENCH IN SOME DIRECTIONS THAN IN OTHERS SO THAT WHILE ANY ACCUSTOMED CONSUMPTION IS RELUCTANTLY GIVEN UP THERE ARE CERTAIN LINES OF CONSUMPTION WHICH ARE GIVEN UP WITH RELATIVELY EXTREME RELUCTANCE
3006-5697-0032 THE ARTICLES OR FORMS OF CONSUMPTION TO WHICH THE CONSUMER CLINGS WITH THE GREATEST TENACITY ARE COMMONLY THE SO CALLED NECESSARIES OF LIFE OR THE SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM THE SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM IS OF COURSE NOT A RIGIDLY DETERMINED ALLOWANCE OF GOODS
3006-5697-0033 IS ORDINARILY GIVEN UP LAST IN CASE OF A PROGRESSIVE RETRENCHMENT OF EXPENDITURE THAT IS TO SAY IN A GENERAL WAY THE MOST ANCIENT AND INGRAINED OF THE HABITS WHICH GOVERN THE INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE THOSE HABITS THAT TOUCH HIS EXISTENCE AS AN ORGANISM ARE THE MOST PERSISTENT AND IMPERATIVE
3006-5697-0034 BEYOND THESE COME THE HIGHER WANTS LATER FORMED HABITS OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE RACE IN A SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR AND BY NO MEANS INVARIABLE GRADATION SOME OF THESE HIGHER WANTS AS FOR INSTANCE THE HABITUAL USE OF CERTAIN STIMULANTS OR THE NEED OF SALVATION
3006-5697-0035 IN THE ESCHATOLOGICAL SENSE OR OF GOOD REPUTE MAY IN SOME CASES TAKE PRECEDENCE OF THE LOWER OR MORE ELEMENTARY WANTS IN GENERAL THE LONGER THE HABITUATION THE MORE UNBROKEN THE HABIT AND THE MORE NEARLY IT COINCIDES WITH PREVIOUS HABITUAL FORMS OF THE LIFE PROCESS
3006-5697-0036 THE MORE PERSISTENTLY WILL THE GIVEN HABIT ASSERT ITSELF THE HABIT WILL BE STRONGER IF THE PARTICULAR TRAITS OF HUMAN NATURE WHICH ITS ACTION INVOLVES OR THE PARTICULAR APTITUDES THAT FIND EXERCISE IN IT ARE TRAITS OR APTITUDES THAT ARE ALREADY LARGELY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERNED IN THE LIFE PROCESS
3006-5697-0037 GOES TO SAY THAT THE FORMATION OF SPECIFIC HABITS IS NOT A MATTER OF LENGTH OF HABITUATION SIMPLY INHERITED APTITUDES AND TRAITS OF TEMPERAMENT COUNT FOR QUITE AS MUCH AS LENGTH OF HABITUATION IN DECIDING WHAT RANGE OF HABITS WILL COME TO DOMINATE ANY INDIVIDUAL'S SCHEME OF LIFE
3006-5697-0038 AND THE PREVALENT TYPE OF TRANSMITTED APTITUDES OR IN OTHER WORDS THE TYPE OF TEMPERAMENT BELONGING TO THE DOMINANT ETHNIC ELEMENT IN ANY COMMUNITY WILL GO FAR TO DECIDE WHAT WILL BE THE SCOPE AND FORM OF EXPRESSION OF THE COMMUNITY'S HABITUAL LIFE PROCESS
3006-5697-0039 HOW GREATLY THE TRANSMITTED IDIOSYNCRASIES OF APTITUDE MAY COUNT IN THE WAY OF A RAPID AND DEFINITIVE FORMATION OF HABIT IN INDIVIDUALS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE EXTREME FACILITY WITH WHICH AN ALL DOMINATING HABIT OF ALCOHOLISM IS SOMETIMES FORMED
3006-5697-0040 OR IN THE SIMILAR FACILITY AND THE SIMILARLY INEVITABLE FORMATION OF A HABIT OF DEVOUT OBSERVANCES IN THE CASE OF PERSONS GIFTED WITH A SPECIAL APTITUDE IN THAT DIRECTION
3006-5697-0041 MUCH THE SAME MEANING ATTACHES TO THAT PECULIAR FACILITY OF HABITUATION TO A SPECIFIC HUMAN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CALLED ROMANTIC LOVE MEN DIFFER IN RESPECT OF TRANSMITTED APTITUDES
3006-5697-0042 OR IN RESPECT OF THE RELATIVE FACILITY WITH WHICH THEY UNFOLD THEIR LIFE ACTIVITY IN PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AND THE HABITS WHICH COINCIDE WITH OR PROCEED UPON A RELATIVELY STRONG SPECIFIC APTITUDE OR A RELATIVELY GREAT SPECIFIC FACILITY OF EXPRESSION BECOME OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE TO THE MAN'S WELL BEING
3006-5697-0043 THE PART PLAYED BY THIS ELEMENT OF APTITUDE IN DETERMINING THE RELATIVE TENACITY OF THE SEVERAL HABITS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE STANDARD OF LIVING GOES TO EXPLAIN THE EXTREME RELUCTANCE WITH WHICH MEN GIVE UP ANY HABITUAL EXPENDITURE IN THE WAY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
3006-5697-0044 THE APTITUDES OR PROPENSITIES TO WHICH A HABIT OF THIS KIND IS TO BE REFERRED AS ITS GROUND ARE THOSE APTITUDES WHOSE EXERCISE IS COMPRISED IN EMULATION AND THE PROPENSITY FOR EMULATION FOR INVIDIOUS COMPARISON IS OF ANCIENT GROWTH AND IS A PERVADING TRAIT OF HUMAN NATURE
3006-5697-0045 IT IS EASILY CALLED INTO VIGOROUS ACTIVITY IN ANY NEW FORM AND IT ASSERTS ITSELF WITH GREAT INSISTENCE UNDER ANY FORM UNDER WHICH IT HAS ONCE FOUND HABITUAL EXPRESSION WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL HAS ONCE FORMED THE HABIT OF SEEKING EXPRESSION IN A GIVEN LINE OF HONORIFIC EXPENDITURE
3006-5697-0046 WHEN A GIVEN SET OF STIMULI HAVE COME TO BE HABITUALLY RESPONDED TO IN ACTIVITY OF A GIVEN KIND AND DIRECTION UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THESE ALERT AND DEEP REACHING PROPENSITIES OF EMULATION IT IS WITH EXTREME RELUCTANCE THAT SUCH AN HABITUAL EXPENDITURE IS GIVEN UP
3006-5697-0047 AND ON THE OTHER HAND WHENEVER AN ACCESSION OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH PUTS THE INDIVIDUAL IN A POSITION TO UNFOLD HIS LIFE PROCESS IN LARGER SCOPE AND WITH ADDITIONAL REACH THE ANCIENT PROPENSITIES OF THE RACE WILL ASSERT THEMSELVES IN DETERMINING THE DIRECTION WHICH THE NEW UNFOLDING OF LIFE IS TO TAKE
3006-5697-0048 AND THOSE PROPENSITIES WHICH ARE ALREADY ACTIVELY IN THE FIELD UNDER SOME RELATED FORM OF EXPRESSION WHICH ARE AIDED BY THE POINTED SUGGESTIONS AFFORDED BY A CURRENT ACCREDITED SCHEME OF LIFE AND FOR THE EXERCISE OF WHICH THE MATERIAL MEANS AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE READILY AVAILABLE
3006-5697-0049 THESE WILL ESPECIALLY HAVE MUCH TO SAY IN SHAPING THE FORM AND DIRECTION IN WHICH THE NEW ACCESSION TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S AGGREGATE FORCE WILL ASSERT ITSELF THAT IS TO SAY IN CONCRETE TERMS IN ANY COMMUNITY WHERE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION IS AN ELEMENT OF THE SCHEME OF LIFE
3006-5697-0050 OF AN EXPENDITURE FOR SOME ACCREDITED LINE OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION THE PROPENSITY FOR EMULATION IS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST AND MOST ALERT AND PERSISTENT OF THE ECONOMIC MOTIVES PROPER
3006-5697-0051 IN AN INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY THIS PROPENSITY FOR EMULATION EXPRESSES ITSELF IN PECUNIARY EMULATION AND THIS SO FAR AS REGARDS THE WESTERN CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES OF THE PRESENT IS VIRTUALLY EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT IT EXPRESSES ITSELF IN SOME FORM OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3006-5697-0052 THE NEED OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE THEREFORE STANDS READY TO ABSORB ANY INCREASE IN THE COMMUNITY'S INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY OR OUTPUT OF GOODS AFTER THE MOST ELEMENTARY PHYSICAL WANTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR WHERE THIS RESULT DOES NOT FOLLOW UNDER MODERN CONDITIONS
3006-5697-0053 THE REASON FOR THE DISCREPANCY IS COMMONLY TO BE SOUGHT IN A RATE OF INCREASE IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S WEALTH TOO RAPID FOR THE HABIT OF EXPENDITURE TO KEEP ABREAST OF IT OR IT MAY BE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION DEFERS THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF THE INCREMENT TO A LATER DATE
3006-5697-0054 ORDINARILY WITH A VIEW TO HEIGHTENING THE SPECTACULAR EFFECT OF THE AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE CONTEMPLATED AS INCREASED INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO PROCURE THE MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD WITH LESS LABOR
3006-5697-0055 THE ENERGIES OF THE INDUSTRIOUS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE BENT TO THE COMPASSING OF A HIGHER RESULT IN CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE RATHER THAN SLACKENED TO A MORE COMFORTABLE PACE THE STRAIN IS NOT LIGHTENED AS INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY INCREASES AND MAKES A LIGHTER STRAIN POSSIBLE
3006-5697-0056 BUT THE INCREMENT OF OUTPUT IS TURNED TO USE TO MEET THIS WANT WHICH IS INDEFINITELY EXPANSIBLE AFTER THE MANNER COMMONLY IMPUTED IN ECONOMIC THEORY TO HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL WANTS
3006-5697-0057 THE ACCEPTED STANDARD OF EXPENDITURE IN THE COMMUNITY OR IN THE CLASS TO WHICH A PERSON BELONGS LARGELY DETERMINES WHAT HIS STANDARD OF LIVING WILL BE IT DOES THIS DIRECTLY BY COMMENDING ITSELF TO HIS COMMON SENSE AS RIGHT AND GOOD
3006-5697-0058 THROUGH HIS HABITUALLY CONTEMPLATING IT AND ASSIMILATING THE SCHEME OF LIFE IN WHICH IT BELONGS BUT IT DOES SO ALSO INDIRECTLY THROUGH POPULAR INSISTENCE ON CONFORMITY TO THE ACCEPTED SCALE OF EXPENDITURE AS A MATTER OF PROPRIETY UNDER PAIN OF DISESTEEM AND OSTRACISM
3006-5697-0059 TO ACCEPT AND PRACTICE THE STANDARD OF LIVING WHICH IS IN VOGUE IS BOTH AGREEABLE AND EXPEDIENT COMMONLY TO THE POINT OF BEING INDISPENSABLE TO PERSONAL COMFORT AND TO SUCCESS IN LIFE THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF ANY CLASS
3006-5697-0060 SO FAR AS CONCERNS THE ELEMENT OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE IS COMMONLY AS HIGH AS THE EARNING CAPACITY OF THE CLASS WILL PERMIT WITH A CONSTANT TENDENCY TO GO HIGHER THE EFFECT UPON THE SERIOUS ACTIVITIES OF MEN IS THEREFORE TO DIRECT THEM WITH GREAT SINGLENESS OF PURPOSE TO THE LARGEST POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OF WEALTH
3006-5697-0061 AND TO DISCOUNTENANCE WORK THAT BRINGS NO PECUNIARY GAIN AT THE SAME TIME THE EFFECT ON CONSUMPTION IS TO CONCENTRATE IT UPON THE LINES WHICH ARE MOST PATENT TO THE OBSERVERS WHOSE GOOD OPINION IS SOUGHT
3006-5697-0062 THROUGH THIS DISCRIMINATION IN FAVOR OF VISIBLE CONSUMPTION IT HAS COME ABOUT THAT THE DOMESTIC LIFE OF MOST CLASSES IS RELATIVELY SHABBY AS COMPARED WITH THE ECLAT OF THAT OVERT PORTION OF THEIR LIFE THAT IS CARRIED ON BEFORE THE EYES OF OBSERVERS
3006-5697-0063 AS A SECONDARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE SAME DISCRIMINATION PEOPLE HABITUALLY SCREEN THEIR PRIVATE LIFE FROM OBSERVATION SO FAR AS CONCERNS THAT PORTION OF THEIR CONSUMPTION THAT MAY WITHOUT BLAME BE CARRIED ON IN SECRET THEY WITHDRAW FROM ALL CONTACT WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS
3006-5697-0064 HENCE THE EXCLUSIVENESS OF PEOPLE AS REGARDS THEIR DOMESTIC LIFE IN MOST OF THE INDUSTRIALLY DEVELOPED COMMUNITIES AND HENCE BY REMOTER DERIVATION THE HABIT OF PRIVACY AND RESERVE THAT IS SO LARGE A FEATURE IN THE CODE OF PROPRIETIES OF THE BETTER CLASS IN ALL COMMUNITIES
3006-5697-0065 THE LOW BIRTHRATE OF THE CLASSES UPON WHOM THE REQUIREMENTS OF REPUTABLE EXPENDITURE FALL WITH GREAT URGENCY IS LIKEWISE TRACEABLE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF A STANDARD OF LIVING BASED ON CONSPICUOUS WASTE THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSEQUENT INCREASED EXPENSE
3006-5697-0066 REQUIRED IN THE REPUTABLE MAINTENANCE OF A CHILD IS VERY CONSIDERABLE AND ACTS AS A POWERFUL DETERRENT
3006-5697-0067 THE EFFECT OF THIS FACTOR OF THE STANDARD OF LIVING BOTH IN THE WAY OF RETRENCHMENT IN THE OBSCURER ELEMENTS OF CONSUMPTION THAT GO TO PHYSICAL COMFORT AND MAINTENANCE AND ALSO IN THE PAUCITY OR ABSENCE OF CHILDREN
3006-5697-0068 IS PERHAPS SEEN AT ITS BEST AMONG THE CLASSES GIVEN TO SCHOLARLY PURSUITS BECAUSE OF A PRESUMED SUPERIORITY AND SCARCITY OF THE GIFTS AND ATTAINMENTS THAT CHARACTERIZE THEIR LIFE THESE CLASSES ARE BY CONVENTION SUBSUMED UNDER A HIGHER SOCIAL GRADE THAN THEIR PECUNIARY GRADE SHOULD WARRANT
3006-5697-0069 AND IT CONSEQUENTLY LEAVES AN EXCEPTIONALLY NARROW MARGIN DISPOSABLE FOR THE OTHER ENDS OF LIFE BY FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES THEIR HABITUAL SENSE OF WHAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT IN THESE MATTERS AS WELL AS THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE WAY OF PECUNIARY DECENCY AMONG THE LEARNED
3006-5697-0070 ARE EXCESSIVELY HIGH AS MEASURED BY THE PREVALENT DEGREE OF OPULENCE AND EARNING CAPACITY OF THE CLASS RELATIVELY TO THE NON SCHOLARLY CLASSES WHOSE SOCIAL EQUALS THEY NOMINALLY ARE IN ANY MODERN COMMUNITY WHERE THERE IS NO PRIESTLY MONOPOLY OF THESE OCCUPATIONS
3006-5697-0071 THE PEOPLE OF SCHOLARLY PURSUITS ARE UNAVOIDABLY THROWN INTO CONTACT WITH CLASSES THAT ARE PECUNIARILY THEIR SUPERIORS
