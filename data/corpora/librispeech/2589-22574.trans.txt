2589-22574-0000 DOROTHY AND RICHARD
2589-22574-0001 IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF AUTUMN AND HAD RAINED ALL DAY THROUGH THE LOZENGE PANES OF THE WIDE ORIEL WINDOW THE WORLD APPEARED IN THE SLOWLY GATHERING DUSK NOT A LITTLE DISMAL
2589-22574-0002 BORDERING THE LITTLE LAWN OR THE HONEYSUCKLE COVERING THE WIDE PORCH FROM WHICH THE SLOW RAIN DROPPED CEASELESSLY UPON THE PEBBLE PAVING BELOW COULD NOT GIVE STEEPY SLOPES HEDGE DIVIDED INTO SMALL FIELDS
2589-22574-0003 SOME GREEN AND DOTTED WITH RED CATTLE OTHERS CROWDED WITH SHOCKS OF BEDRAGGLED AND DROOPING CORN WHICH LOOKED SUFFERING AND PATIENT THE ROOM TO WHICH THE WINDOW HAVING THIS PROSPECT BELONGED WAS LARGE AND LOW
2589-22574-0004 SAT GAZING SADLY INTO THE FLAMES WHICH SHONE ROSY THROUGH THE THIN HANDS SPREAD OUT BEFORE THEM AT THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE GREAT LOW ARCHED CHIMNEY SAT A LADY PAST THE PRIME OF LIFE BUT STILL BEAUTIFUL
2589-22574-0005 THOUGH THE BEAUTY WAS ALL BUT MERGED IN THE LOVELINESS THAT RISES FROM THE HEART TO THE FACE OF SUCH AS HAVE TAKEN THE GREATEST STEP IN LIFE THAT IS AS THE OLD PROVERB SAYS THE STEP OUT OF DOORS
2589-22574-0006 SHE WAS PLAINLY YET RATHER RICHLY DRESSED IN GARMENTS OF AN OLD FASHIONED AND WELL PRESERVED LOOK HER HAIR WAS CUT SHORT ABOVE HER FOREHEAD AND FRIZZED OUT IN BUNCHES OF LITTLE CURLS ON EACH SIDE
2589-22574-0007 SO QUIETLY DID THEY REST ON THE FACE OF THE OLD MAN WHO WAS PLAINLY A CLERGYMAN IT WAS A SMALL PALE THIN DELICATELY AND SYMMETRICALLY FORMED FACE YET NOT THE LESS A STRONG ONE
2589-22574-0008 AND FORCE IN THE CLOSED LIPS WHILE A GOOD CONSCIENCE LOOKED CLEAR OUT OF THE GREY EYES THEY HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FAST GATHERING TIDE OF OPINION WHICH
2589-22574-0009 HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO BEAT SO FURIOUSLY AGAINST THE MOLES AND RAMPARTS OF CHURCH AND KINGDOM THE EXECUTION OF LORD STRAFFORD WAS NEWS THAT HAD NOT YET BEGUN TO HISS THE SPEAKER IT IS INDEED AN EVIL TIME
2589-22574-0010 SAID THE OLD MAN THE WORLD HAS SELDOM SEEN ITS LIKE BUT TELL ME MASTER HERBERT SAID THE LADY WHY COMES IT IN THIS OUR DAY FOR OUR SINS OR FOR THE SINS OF OUR FATHERS
2589-22574-0011 RETURNED HER GUEST I MEDDLE NOT LIKE SOME THAT SHOULD BE WISER WITH THE CALLING OF THE PROPHET IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO KNOW THAT EVER AND AGAIN THE PRIDE OF MAN WILL GATHER
2589-22574-0012 OVERFED OF RAINS BURST THE BANKS THAT CONFINE IT WHETHER THEY BE THE LAWS OF THE LAND OR THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH USURPING ON THE FRUITFUL MEADOWS THE HOPE OF LIFE FOR MAN AND BEAST ALAS HE WENT ON
2589-22574-0013 WITH A NEW SUGGESTION FROM THE IMAGE HE HAD BEEN USING IF THE BEGINNING OF STRIFE BE AS THE LETTING OUT OF WATER WHAT SHALL BE THE END OF THAT STRIFE WHOSE BEGINNING IS THE LETTING OUT OF BLOOD THINK YOU THEN GOOD SIR THAT THUS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
2589-22574-0014 THAT SUCH TIMES OF FIERCE UNGODLY TEMPEST MUST EVER FOLLOW UPON SEASONS OF PEACE AND COMFORT EVEN AS YOUR COUSIN OF HOLY MEMORY IN HIS VERSES CONCERNING THE CHURCH MILITANT WRITES THUS ALSO SIN AND DARKNESS FOLLOW STILL
2589-22574-0015 THE CHURCH AND SUN WITH ALL THEIR POWER AND SKILL TRULY IT SEEMS SO BUT I THANK GOD THE DAYS OF MY PILGRIMAGE ARE NEARLY NUMBERED TO JUDGE BY THE TOKENS THE WISE MAN GIVES US
2589-22574-0016 AND COULD IMAGINE NO ABATEMENT IN THE STEADY RAIN POUR WE SHALL LEAVE BEHIND US STRONG HEARTS AND SOUND HEADS TOO SAID MISTER HERBERT AND I BETHINK ME THERE WILL BE NONE STRONGER OR SOUNDER THAN THOSE OF YOUR YOUNG COUSINS
2589-22574-0017 MY LATE PUPILS OF WHOM I HEAR BRAVE THINGS FROM OXFORD AND IN WHOSE AFFECTION MY SPIRIT CONSTANTLY REJOICES YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR SUCH GOOD NEWS OF YOUR RELATIVES DOROTHY SAID THE LADY ADDRESSING HER DAUGHTER
2589-22574-0018 BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM OR HEARD OF THEM EXCEPT FROM MASTER HERBERT WHO HAS INDEED OFTEN SPOKE RARE THINGS OF THEM MISTRESS DOROTHY WILL STILL KNOW THE REASON WHY SAID THE CLERGYMAN SMILING
2589-22574-0019 AND THE TWO RESUMED THEIR CONVERSATION BUT THE GIRL ROSE AND TURNING AGAIN TO THE WINDOW STOOD FOR A MOMENT RAPT IN THE TRANSFIGURATION PASSING UPON THE WORLD THE VAULT OF GREY WAS UTTERLY SHATTERED
2589-22574-0020 WAS SHAKING THE JEWELS FROM THEIR FEATHERY TOPS THE SUNFLOWERS AND HOLLYHOCKS NO LONGER COWERED UNDER THE TYRANNY OF THE RAIN BUT BOWED BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF THE GEMS THAT ADORNED THEM A FLAME BURNED AS UPON AN ALTAR
2589-22574-0021 ON THE TOP OF EVERY TREE AND THE VERY POOLS THAT LAY ON THE DISTANT ROAD HAD THEIR MESSAGE OF LIGHT TO GIVE TO THE HOPELESS EARTH AS SHE GAZED ANOTHER HUE THAN THAT OF THE SUNSET YET ROSY TOO GRADUALLY FLUSHED THE FACE OF THE MAIDEN
2589-22574-0022 SHE TURNED SUDDENLY FROM THE WINDOW AND LEFT THE ROOM SHAKING A SHOWER OF DIAMONDS FROM THE HONEYSUCKLE AS SHE PASSED OUT THROUGH THE PORCH UPON THE GRAVEL WALK POSSIBLY HER ELDERS FOUND HER DEPARTURE A RELIEF FOR ALTHOUGH THEY TOOK NO NOTICE OF IT
2589-22574-0023 LIKE THE ROOMS WITHIN THOSE SHUTTERED WINDOWS THE INHABITED WING SHE HAD LEFT LOOKED LIKE THE DWELLING OF A YEOMAN FARMING HIS OWN LAND
2589-22574-0024 FOR GENERATIONS IT HAD BEEN SLOWLY DESCENDING IN THE SCALE OF WORLDLY ACCOUNT
2589-22574-0025 WAS LARGER THAN THEIR MEANS COULD MATCH WITH CORRESPONDENT OUTLAY SUCH HOWEVER WAS THE CHARACTER OF LADY VAUGHAN THAT ALTHOUGH SHE MINGLED LITTLE WITH THE GREAT FAMILIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SHE WAS SO MUCH RESPECTED
2589-22574-0026 AND OF THE FAMOUS DOCTOR DONNE STRONGLY ATTACHED TO THE ENGLISH CHURCH AND RECOILING WITH DISGUST FROM THE PRACTICES OF THE PURITANS AS MUCH PERHAPS FROM REFINEMENT OF TASTE AS ABHORRENCE OF SCHISM HE HAD NEVER YET FALLEN INTO SUCH A PASSION FOR EPISCOPACY
2589-22574-0027 AS TO FEEL ANY CORDIALITY TOWARDS THE SCHEMES OF THE ARCHBISHOP TO THOSE WHO KNEW HIM HIS SILENCE CONCERNING IT WAS A LOUDER PROTEST AGAINST THE POLICY OF LAUD THAN THE FIERCEST DENUNCIATIONS OF THE PURITANS
2589-22574-0028 ONCE ONLY HAD HE BEEN HEARD TO UTTER HIMSELF UNGUARDEDLY IN RESPECT OF THE PRIMATE AND THAT WAS AMONGST FRIENDS AND AFTER THE SECOND GLASS PERMITTED OF HIS COUSIN GEORGE TUT LAUD ME NO LAUD HE SAID
2589-22574-0029 A SKIPPING BISHOP IS WORSE THAN A SKIPPING KING ONCE ALSO HE HAD BEEN OVERHEARD MURMURING TO HIMSELF BY WAY OF CONSOLEMENT BISHOPS PASS THE CHURCH REMAINS HE HAD BEEN A GREAT FRIEND OF THE LATE SIR RINGWOOD
2589-22574-0030 AND ALTHOUGH THE DISTANCE FROM HIS PARISH WAS TOO GREAT TO BE TRAVELLED OFTEN HE SELDOM LET A YEAR GO BY WITHOUT PAYING A VISIT TO HIS FRIEND'S WIDOW AND DAUGHTER TURNING HER BACK ON THE CENOTAPH OF THEIR FORMER GREATNESS
2589-22574-0031 DOROTHY DIVED INTO A LONG PLEACHED ALLEY CARELESS OF THE DRIP FROM OVERHEAD AND HURRYING THROUGH IT CAME TO A CIRCULAR PATCH OF THIN GRASS ROUNDED BY A LOFTY HEDGE OF YEW TREES IN THE MIDST OF WHICH
2589-22574-0032 STOOD WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN A SUN DIAL IT MATTERED LITTLE HOWEVER THAT ONLY THE STUMP OF A GNOMON WAS LEFT SEEING THE HEDGE AROUND IT HAD GROWN TO SUCH A HEIGHT IN RELATION TO THE DIAMETER OF THE CIRCLE THAT IT WAS ONLY FOR A VERY BRIEF HOUR OR SO
