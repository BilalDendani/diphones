1225-129802-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO HOSTILITIES
1225-129802-0001 SPACIOUS ENOUGH TO HAVE GIVEN MOORINGS TO ALL THE SHIPS OF ALL THE NAVIES OF THE WORLD THE ARABELLA RODE AT ANCHOR ALMOST SHE HAD THE AIR OF A PRISONER FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE AHEAD TO STARBOARD ROSE THE LOFTY MASSIVE

1225-129802-0005 AND UNDER THE DIRECTIONS OF HAYTON THE BO'SUN THE SWABBERS WERE AT WORK IN THE WAIST AND FORECASTLE DESPITE THE HEAT AND THE STAGNANT AIR ONE OF THE TOILERS FOUND BREATH TO CROAK A RIBALD BUCCANEERING DITTY
1225-129802-0006 SO IT'S HEIGH HO AND HEAVE A HO WHO'LL SAIL FOR THE MAIN WITH ME BLOOD FETCHED A SIGH AND THE GHOST OF A SMILE PLAYED OVER HIS LEAN SUN TANNED FACE
1225-129802-0007 THEN THE BLACK BROWS CAME TOGETHER ABOVE THE VIVID BLUE EYES AND THOUGHT SWIFTLY CLOSED THE DOOR UPON HIS IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS THINGS HAD NOT SPED AT ALL WELL WITH HIM IN THE PAST FORTNIGHT SINCE HIS ACCEPTANCE OF THE KING'S COMMISSION
1225-129802-0008 THERE HAD BEEN TROUBLE WITH BISHOP FROM THE MOMENT OF LANDING AS BLOOD AND LORD JULIAN HAD STEPPED ASHORE TOGETHER THEY HAD BEEN MET BY A MAN WHO TOOK NO PAINS TO DISSEMBLE HIS CHAGRIN AT THE TURN OF EVENTS AND HIS DETERMINATION TO CHANGE IT
1225-129802-0009 HE AWAITED THEM ON THE MOLE SUPPORTED BY A GROUP OF OFFICERS YOU ARE LORD JULIAN WADE I UNDERSTAND WAS HIS TRUCULENT GREETING FOR BLOOD AT THE MOMENT HE HAD NOTHING BEYOND A MALIGNANT GLANCE
1225-129802-0010 AND BELATEDLY BOWED REMOVING HIS BROAD HAT THEN HE PLUNGED ON YOU HAVE GRANTED I AM TOLD THE KING'S COMMISSION TO THIS MAN HIS VERY TONE BETRAYED THE BITTERNESS OF HIS RANCOUR
1225-129802-0011 YOUR MOTIVES WERE NO DOUBT WORTHY YOUR GRATITUDE TO HIM FOR DELIVERING YOU FROM THE SPANIARDS BUT THE THING ITSELF IS UNTHINKABLE MY LORD THE COMMISSION MUST BE CANCELLED I

1225-129802-0014 I ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I WAS FULLY INFORMED OF ALL I DO NOT GRANT THE KING'S COMMISSION LIGHTLY DON'T YOU BY GOD
1225-129802-0015 BLOOD WOULD HAVE INTERVENED AT THAT
1225-129802-0016 AND WITH A FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE FACTS HIS LORDSHIP EXPRESSLY DESIGNATED CAPTAIN BLOOD FOR THIS COMMISSION IF CAPTAIN BLOOD COULD BE PERSUADED TO ACCEPT IT COLONEL BISHOP'S MOUTH FELL OPEN IN SURPRISE AND DISMAY
1225-129802-0017 LORD SUNDERLAND DESIGNATED HIM HE ASKED AMAZED EXPRESSLY HIS LORDSHIP WAITED A MOMENT FOR A REPLY NONE COMING FROM THE SPEECHLESS DEPUTY GOVERNOR
1225-129802-0018 HE ASKED A QUESTION WOULD YOU STILL VENTURE TO DESCRIBE THE MATTER AS A MISTAKE SIR AND DARE YOU TAKE THE RISK OF CORRECTING IT I I HAD NOT DREAMED
1225-129802-0019 I UNDERSTAND SIR LET ME PRESENT CAPTAIN BLOOD PERFORCE BISHOP MUST PUT ON THE BEST FACE HE COULD COMMAND BUT THAT IT WAS NO MORE THAN A MASK FOR HIS FURY
1225-129802-0020 AND HIS VENOM WAS PLAIN TO ALL FROM THAT UNPROMISING BEGINNING MATTERS HAD NOT IMPROVED
1225-129802-0021 BLOOD'S THOUGHTS WERE UPON THIS AND OTHER THINGS AS HE LOUNGED THERE ON THE DAY BED HE HAD BEEN A FORTNIGHT IN PORT ROYAL HIS SHIP VIRTUALLY A UNIT NOW IN THE JAMAICA SQUADRON AND WHEN THE NEWS OF IT REACHED TORTUGA AND THE BUCCANEERS WHO AWAITED HIS RETURN
1225-129802-0022 FOR WHAT WOULD BE ACCOUNTED A TREACHEROUS DEFECTION AND FOR WHAT HAD HE PLACED HIMSELF IN THIS POSITION FOR THE SAKE OF A GIRL WHO AVOIDED HIM SO PERSISTENTLY AND INTENTIONALLY
1225-129802-0023 THAT HE MUST ASSUME THAT SHE STILL REGARDED HIM WITH AVERSION HE HAD SCARCELY BEEN VOUCHSAFED A GLIMPSE OF HER IN ALL THIS FORTNIGHT ALTHOUGH WITH THAT IN VIEW FOR HIS MAIN OBJECT HE HAD DAILY HAUNTED HER UNCLE'S RESIDENCE AND DAILY BRAVED THE UNMASKED HOSTILITY
1225-129802-0024 AND BAFFLED RANCOUR IN WHICH COLONEL BISHOP HELD HIM NOR WAS THAT THE WORST OF IT HE WAS ALLOWED PLAINLY TO PERCEIVE THAT IT WAS THE GRACEFUL ELEGANT YOUNG TRIFLER FROM SAINT JAMES'S LORD JULIAN WADE
1225-129802-0025 TO WHOM HER EVERY MOMENT WAS DEVOTED AND WHAT CHANCE HAD HE A DESPERATE ADVENTURER WITH A RECORD OF OUTLAWRY AGAINST SUCH A RIVAL AS THAT A MAN OF PARTS MOREOVER AS HE WAS BOUND TO ADMIT
1225-129802-0026 YOU CONCEIVE THE BITTERNESS OF HIS SOUL HE BEHELD HIMSELF TO BE AS THE DOG IN THE FABLE THAT HAD DROPPED THE SUBSTANCE TO SNATCH AT A DELUSIVE SHADOW
1225-129802-0027 HE SOUGHT COMFORT IN A LINE ON THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM LEVIUS FIT PATIENTIA
1225-129802-0028 SOUGHT IT BUT HARDLY FOUND IT A BOAT THAT HAD APPROACHED UNNOTICED FROM THE SHORE CAME SCRAPING AND BUMPING AGAINST THE GREAT RED HULL OF THE ARABELLA
1225-129802-0029 AND A RAUCOUS VOICE SENT UP A HAILING SHOUT FROM THE SHIP'S BELFRY TWO SILVERY NOTES RANG CLEAR AND SHARP
1225-129802-0030 THE SOUNDS DISTURBED CAPTAIN BLOOD FROM HIS DISGRUNTLED MUSINGS HE ROSE TALL ACTIVE AND ARRESTINGLY ELEGANT IN A SCARLET GOLD LACED COAT THAT ADVERTISED HIS NEW POSITION AND SLIPPING THE SLENDER VOLUME INTO HIS POCKET
1225-129802-0031 PITT LOOSELY CLAD IN SHIRT AND BREECHES LEANED AGAINST THE RAIL THE WHILE AND WATCHED HIM UNMISTAKABLE CONCERN IMPRINTED ON HIS FAIR FRANK COUNTENANCE
1225-129802-0032 IT IS A VERY PEREMPTORY SUMMONS HE SAID AND PASSED THE NOTE TO HIS FRIEND THE YOUNG MASTER'S GREY EYES SKIMMED IT THOUGHTFULLY HE STROKED HIS GOLDEN BEARD YOU'LL NOT GO
1225-129802-0033 HE SAID BETWEEN QUESTION AND ASSERTION WHY NOT HAVEN'T I BEEN A DAILY VISITOR AT THE FORT BUT IT'LL BE ABOUT THE OLD WOLF THAT HE WANTS TO SEE YOU IT GIVES HIM A GRIEVANCE AT LAST YOU KNOW PETER
1225-129802-0034 THAT IT IS LORD JULIAN ALONE HAS STOOD BETWEEN BISHOP AND HIS HATE OF YOU IF NOW HE CAN SHOW THAT WHAT IF HE CAN BLOOD INTERRUPTED CARELESSLY SHALL I BE IN GREATER DANGER ASHORE THAN ABOARD NOW THAT WE'VE BUT FIFTY MEN LEFT
1225-129802-0035 AND THEY LUKEWARM ROGUES WHO WOULD AS SOON SERVE THE KING AS ME JEREMY DEAR LAD THE ARABELLA'S A PRISONER HERE BEDAD TWIXT THE FORT THERE AND THE FLEET YONDER DON'T BE FORGETTING THAT
1225-129802-0036 JEREMY CLENCHED HIS HANDS WHY DID YE LET WOLVERSTONE AND THE OTHERS GO HE CRIED WITH A TOUCH OF BITTERNESS YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE DANGER
1225-129802-0037 HOW COULD I IN HONESTY HAVE DETAINED THEM IT WAS IN THE BARGAIN
1225-129802-0038 YE SEE HE SAID AND SHRUGGED I'LL BE GETTING MY HAT AND CANE AND SWORD AND GO ASHORE IN THE COCK BOAT SEE IT MANNED FOR ME YE'RE GOING TO DELIVER YOURSELF INTO BISHOP'S HANDS PITT WARNED HIM
1225-129802-0039 WELL WELL MAYBE HE'LL NOT FIND ME QUITE SO EASY TO GRASP AS HE IMAGINES THERE'S A THORN OR TWO LEFT ON ME AND WITH A LAUGH BLOOD DEPARTED TO HIS CABIN
1225-129802-0040 THEN SLOWLY RELUCTANCE DRAGGING AT HIS FEET HE WENT DOWN THE COMPANION TO GIVE THE ORDER FOR THE COCK BOAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU PETER HE SAID
1225-129802-0041 COLONEL BISHOP HAD BETTER LOOK TO HIMSELF THESE FIFTY LADS MAY BE LUKEWARM AT PRESENT AS YOU SAY BUT SINK ME THEY'LL BE ANYTHING BUT LUKEWARM IF THERE'S A BREACH OF FAITH AND WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING TO ME JEREMY
1225-129802-0042 SURE NOW I'LL BE BACK FOR DINNER SO I WILL BLOOD CLIMBED DOWN INTO THE WAITING BOAT BUT LAUGH THOUGH HE MIGHT HE KNEW AS WELL AS PITT THAT IN GOING ASHORE THAT MORNING HE CARRIED HIS LIFE IN HIS HANDS
1225-129802-0043 BECAUSE OF THIS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT WHEN HE STEPPED ON TO THE NARROW MOLE
1225-129802-0044 THROUGH WHOSE CRENELS WERE THRUST THE BLACK NOSES OF ITS HEAVY GUNS HE GAVE ORDER THAT THE BOAT SHOULD STAY FOR HIM AT THAT SPOT HE REALIZED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO RETREAT IN A HURRY
1225-129802-0045 WALKING LEISURELY HE SKIRTED THE EMBATTLED WALL AND PASSED THROUGH THE GREAT GATES INTO THE COURTYARD HALF A DOZEN SOLDIERS LOUNGED THERE
1225-129802-0046 THAT WAS FRINGED WITH PALM AND SANDALWOOD HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF MISS BISHOP ALONE HE CROSSED THE COURTYARD WITH SUDDENLY LENGTHENED STRIDE GOOD MORNING TO YE MA'AM WAS HIS GREETING AS HE OVERTOOK HER AND HAT IN HAND NOW
1225-129802-0047 SURE IT'S NOTHING LESS THAN UNCHARITABLE TO MAKE ME RUN IN THIS HEAT WHY DO YOU RUN THEN SHE ASKED HIM COOLLY STANDING SLIM AND STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
1225-129802-0048 ALL IN WHITE AND VERY MAIDENLY SAVE IN HER UNNATURAL COMPOSURE I AM PRESSED SHE INFORMED HIM SO YOU WILL FORGIVE ME IF I DO NOT STAY YOU WERE NONE SO PRESSED UNTIL I CAME HE PROTESTED
1225-129802-0049 AND IF HIS THIN LIPS SMILED HIS BLUE EYES WERE ODDLY HARD SINCE YOU PERCEIVE IT SIR I WONDER THAT YOU TROUBLE TO BE SO INSISTENT THAT CROSSED THE SWORDS BETWEEN THEM
1225-129802-0050 FAITH YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF AFTER A FASHION SAID HE BUT SINCE IT WAS MORE OR LESS IN YOUR SERVICE THAT I DONNED THE KING'S COAT YOU SHOULD SUFFER IT TO COVER THE THIEF AND PIRATE SHE SHRUGGED AND TURNED ASIDE
1225-129802-0051 IN SOME RESENTMENT AND SOME REGRET FEARING TO BETRAY THE LATTER SHE TOOK REFUGE IN THE FORMER I DO MY BEST SAID SHE SO THAT YE CAN BE CHARITABLE IN SOME WAYS HE LAUGHED SOFTLY
1225-129802-0052 GLORY BE NOW I SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR SO MUCH MAYBE I'M PRESUMPTUOUS BUT I CAN'T FORGET THAT WHEN I WAS NO BETTER THAN A SLAVE IN YOUR UNCLE'S HOUSEHOLD IN BARBADOS YE USED ME WITH A CERTAIN KINDNESS WHY NOT
