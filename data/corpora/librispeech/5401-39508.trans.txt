5401-39508-0000 METAMORPHISM AND MINERAL VEINS UNDER THE ACTION OF INTERNAL AGENCIES ROCKS OF ALL KINDS MAY BE RENDERED HARDER
5401-39508-0001 THESE PROCESSES ARE KNOWN AS METAMORPHISM AND THE ROCKS AFFECTED WHETHER ORIGINALLY SEDIMENTARY OR IGNEOUS ARE CALLED METAMORPHIC ROCKS WE MAY CONTRAST WITH METAMORPHISM THE ACTION OF EXTERNAL AGENCIES IN WEATHERING
5401-39508-0002 WHICH RENDER ROCKS LESS COHERENT BY DISSOLVING THEIR SOLUBLE PARTS AND BREAKING DOWN THEIR CRYSTALLINE GRAINS CONTACT METAMORPHISM
5401-39508-0003 ROCKS BENEATH A LAVA FLOW OR IN CONTACT WITH IGNEOUS INTRUSIONS ARE FOUND TO BE METAMORPHOSED TO VARIOUS DEGREES BY THE HEAT OF THE COOLING MASS THE ADJACENT STRATA MAY BE CHANGED ONLY IN COLOR HARDNESS AND TEXTURE
5401-39508-0004 THUS NEXT TO A DIKE BITUMINOUS COAL MAY BE BAKED TO COKE OR ANTHRACITE AND CHALK AND LIMESTONE TO CRYSTALLINE MARBLE SANDSTONE MAY BE CONVERTED INTO QUARTZITE AND SHALE INTO ARGILLITE A COMPACT MASSIVE CLAY ROCK
5401-39508-0005 NEW MINERALS MAY ALSO BE DEVELOPED IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS THERE MAY BE PRODUCED CRYSTALS OF MICA AND OF GARNET A MINERAL AS HARD AS QUARTZ COMMONLY OCCURRING IN RED TWELVE SIDED CRYSTALS
5401-39508-0006 WHERE THE CHANGES ARE MOST PROFOUND ROCKS MAY BE WHOLLY MADE OVER IN STRUCTURE AND MINERAL COMPOSITION IN CONTACT METAMORPHISM THIN SHEETS OF MOLTEN ROCK PRODUCE LESS EFFECT THAN THICKER ONES THE STRONGEST HEAT EFFECTS ARE NATURALLY CAUSED BY BOSSES
5401-39508-0007 AND REGIONAL INTRUSIONS AND THE ZONE OF CHANGE ABOUT THEM MAY BE SEVERAL MILES IN WIDTH IN THESE CHANGES HEATED WATERS AND VAPORS FROM THE MASSES OF IGNEOUS ROCKS UNDOUBTEDLY PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART WHICH WILL BE MORE STRONGLY ALTERED
5401-39508-0008 THE ROCKS ABOUT A CLOSED DIKE IN WHICH LAVA BEGAN TO COOL AS SOON AS IT FILLED THE FISSURE OR THE ROCKS ABOUT A DIKE WHICH OPENED ON THE SURFACE AND THROUGH WHICH THE MOLTEN ROCK FLOWED FOR SOME TIME TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PART PLAYED BY HEATED WATERS
5401-39508-0009 METAMORPHIC ROCKS OCCUR WIDE SPREAD IN MANY REGIONS OFTEN HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES IN AREA WHERE SUCH EXTENSIVE CHANGES CANNOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY IGNEOUS INTRUSIONS SUCH ARE THE DISSECTED CORES OF LOFTY MOUNTAINS AS THE ALPS
5401-39508-0010 AND THE WORN DOWN BASES OF ANCIENT RANGES AS IN NEW ENGLAND LARGE AREAS IN THE PIEDMONT BELT AND THE LAURENTIAN PENEPLAIN IN THESE REGIONS THE ROCKS HAVE YIELDED TO IMMENSE PRESSURE
5401-39508-0011 AND EVEN THEIR MINUTE GRAINS AS ONE MAY SEE WITH A MICROSCOPE HAVE OFTEN BEEN PUCKERED BROKEN AND CRUSHED TO POWDER IT IS TO THESE MECHANICAL MOVEMENTS AND STRAINS WHICH THE ROCKS HAVE SUFFERED IN EVERY PART THAT WE MAY ATTRIBUTE THEIR METAMORPHISM
5401-39508-0012 OTHER FACTORS HOWEVER HAVE PLAYED IMPORTANT PARTS ROCK CRUSHING DEVELOPS HEAT AND ALLOWS A FREER CIRCULATION OF HEATED WATERS AND VAPORS THUS CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE GREATLY QUICKENED MINERALS ARE DISSOLVED AND REDEPOSITED IN NEW POSITIONS
5401-39508-0013 OR THEIR CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS MAY RECOMBINE IN NEW MINERALS ENTIRELY CHANGING THE NATURE OF THE ROCK AS WHEN FOR EXAMPLE FELDSPAR RECRYSTALLIZES AS QUARTZ AND MICA EARLY STAGES OF METAMORPHISM ARE SEEN IN SLATE
5401-39508-0014 UNDER SOMEWHAT GREATER PRESSURE SLATE BECOMES PHYLLITE A CLAY SLATE WHOSE CLEAVAGE SURFACES ARE LUSTROUS WITH FLAT LYING MICA FLAKES
5401-39508-0015 THE SAME PRESSURE WHICH HAS CAUSED THE ROCK TO CLEAVE HAS SET FREE SOME OF ITS MINERAL CONSTITUENTS ALONG THE CLEAVAGE PLANES TO CRYSTALLIZE THERE AS MICA FOLIATION UNDER STILL STRONGER PRESSURE THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF THE ROCK IS ALTERED
5401-39508-0016 GNEISS IS THE GENERAL NAME UNDER WHICH ARE COMPRISED COARSELY FOLIATED ROCKS BANDED WITH IRREGULAR LAYERS OF FELDSPAR AND OTHER MINERALS
5401-39508-0017 THESE FOLIA CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE LAMINAE OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS BY THEIR LENTICULAR FORM AND LACK OF CONTINUITY AND ESPECIALLY BY THE FACT THAT THEY CONSIST OF PLATY CRYSTALLINE GRAINS AND NOT OF PARTICLES ROUNDED BY WEAR
5401-39508-0018 MICA SCHIST THE MOST COMMON OF SCHISTS AND IN FACT OF ALL METAMORPHIC ROCKS IS COMPOSED OF MICA AND QUARTZ IN ALTERNATING WAVY FOLIA ALL GRADATIONS BETWEEN IT AND PHYLLITE MAY BE TRACED
5401-39508-0019 IT IS WIDESPREAD IN NEW ENGLAND AND ALONG THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS TALC SCHIST CONSISTS OF QUARTZ AND TALC A LIGHT COLORED MAGNESIAN MINERAL OF GREASY FEEL AND SO SOFT THAT IT CAN BE SCRATCHED WITH THE THUMB NAIL
5401-39508-0020 HORNBLENDE SCHIST RESULTING IN MANY CASES FROM THE FOLIATION OF BASIC IGNEOUS ROCKS IS MADE OF FOLIA OF HORNBLENDE ALTERNATING WITH BANDS OF QUARTZ AND FELDSPAR HORNBLENDE SCHIST IS COMMON OVER LARGE AREAS IN THE LAKE SUPERIOR REGION
5401-39508-0021 MAY BE METAMORPHOSED INTO SCHISTS BY CRUSHING AND SHEARING LIMESTONES HOWEVER ARE METAMORPHOSED BY PRESSURE INTO MARBLE THE GRAINS OF CARBONATE OF LIME RECRYSTALLIZING FREELY TO INTERLOCKING CRYSTALS OF CALCITE
5401-39508-0022 THESE FEW EXAMPLES MUST SUFFICE OF THE GREAT CLASS OF METAMORPHIC ROCKS AS WE HAVE SEEN
5401-39508-0023 BUT THE CHANGE IS OFTEN SO COMPLETE THAT NO TRACE OF THEIR ORIGINAL STRUCTURE AND MINERAL COMPOSITION REMAINS TO TELL WHETHER THE ROCKS FROM WHICH THEY WERE DERIVED WERE SEDIMENTARY OR IGNEOUS OR TO WHAT VARIETY OF EITHER OF THESE CLASSES THEY BELONGED
5401-39508-0024 IN MANY CASES HOWEVER THE EARLY HISTORY OF A METAMORPHIC ROCK CAN BE DECIPHERED FOSSILS NOT WHOLLY OBLITERATED MAY PROVE IT ORIGINALLY WATER LAID SCHISTS MAY CONTAIN ROLLED OUT PEBBLES
5401-39508-0025 SHOWING THEIR DERIVATION FROM A CONGLOMERATE DIKES OF IGNEOUS ROCKS MAY BE FOLLOWED INTO A REGION WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN FOLIATED BY PRESSURE THE MOST THOROUGHLY METAMORPHOSED ROCKS MAY SOMETIMES BE TRACED OUT INTO UNALTERED SEDIMENTARY OR IGNEOUS ROCKS
5401-39508-0026 OR AMONG THEM MAY BE FOUND PATCHES OF LITTLE CHANGE WHERE THEIR HISTORY MAYBE READ METAMORPHISM IS MOST COMMON AMONG ROCKS OF THE EARLIER GEOLOGICAL AGES AND MOST RARE AMONG ROCKS OF RECENT FORMATION
5401-39508-0027 NO DOUBT IT IS NOW IN PROGRESS WHERE DEEP BURIED SEDIMENTS ARE INVADED BY HEAT EITHER FROM INTRUSIVE IGNEOUS MASSES OR FROM THE EARTH'S INTERIOR
5401-39508-0028 WHY DO METAMORPHIC ROCKS APPEAR ON THE SURFACE TO DAY MINERAL VEINS IN REGIONS OF FOLDED AND BROKEN ROCKS FISSURES ARE FREQUENTLY FOUND TO BE FILLED WITH SHEETS OF CRYSTALLINE MINERALS DEPOSITED FROM SOLUTION BY UNDERGROUND WATER
5401-39508-0029 A HEAVY WHITE MINERAL ARE ABUNDANT IN MANY VEINS THE GOLD BEARING QUARTZ VEINS OF CALIFORNIA TRAVERSE THE METAMORPHIC SLATES OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS
5401-39508-0030 THE LATTER CONTAINING THREADS AND GRAINS OF NATIVE GOLD
5401-39508-0031 THE PLACER DEPOSITS OF CALIFORNIA AND OTHER REGIONS ARE GOLD BEARING DEPOSITS OF GRAVEL AND SAND IN RIVER BEDS THE HEAVY GOLD IS APT TO BE FOUND MOSTLY NEAR OR UPON THE SOLID ROCK
5401-39508-0032 CHALCOPYRITE A MINERAL SOFTER THAN PYRITE IT CAN EASILY BE SCRATCHED WITH A KNIFE AND DEEPER YELLOW IN COLOR
5401-39508-0033 IN OUR STUDY OF UNDERGROUND WATER WE LEARNED THAT IT IS EVERYWHERE CIRCULATING THROUGH THE PERMEABLE ROCKS OF THE CRUST DESCENDING TO PROFOUND DEPTHS UNDER THE ACTION OF GRAVITY AND AGAIN DRIVEN TO THE SURFACE BY HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE
5401-39508-0034 NOW FISSURES WHEREVER THEY OCCUR FORM THE TRUNK CHANNELS OF THE UNDERGROUND CIRCULATION WATER DESCENDS FROM THE SURFACE ALONG THESE RIFTS IT MOVES LATERALLY FROM EITHER SIDE TO THE FISSURE PLANE
5401-39508-0035 JUST AS GROUND WATER SEEPS THROUGH THE SURROUNDING ROCKS FROM EVERY DIRECTION TO A WELL AND IT ASCENDS THROUGH THESE NATURAL WATER WAYS AS IN AN ARTESIAN WELL WHENEVER THEY INTERSECT AN AQUIFER IN WHICH WATER IS UNDER HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE
5401-39508-0036 THE SOLVENT POWER OF THE WATER IS THUS GREATLY INCREASED AND IT TAKES UP INTO SOLUTION VARIOUS SUBSTANCES FROM THE IGNEOUS AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS WHICH IT TRAVERSES
5401-39508-0037 FOR VARIOUS REASONS THESE SUBSTANCES STANCES ARE DEPOSITED IN THE VEIN AS ORES AND VEIN STONES ON RISING THROUGH THE FISSURE THE WATER COOLS AND LOSES PRESSURE AND ITS CAPACITY TO HOLD MINERALS IN SOLUTION IS THEREFORE LESSENED
5401-39508-0038 BESIDES AS DIFFERENT CURRENTS MEET IN THE FISSURE SOME ASCENDING SOME DESCENDING AND SOME COMING IN FROM THE SIDES THE CHEMICAL REACTION OF THESE VARIOUS WEAK SOLUTIONS UPON ONE ANOTHER AND UPON THE WALLS OF THE VEIN PRECIPITATES THE MINERALS OF VEIN STUFFS AND ORES
5401-39508-0039 AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE METHOD OF VEIN DEPOSITS WE MAY CITE THE CASE OF A WOODEN BOX PIPE USED IN THE COMSTOCK MINES NEVADA TO CARRY THE HOT WATER OF THE MINE FROM ONE LEVEL TO ANOTHER
5401-39508-0040 THE STEAMBOAT SPRINGS NEVADA FURNISH EXAMPLES OF MINERAL VEINS IN PROCESS OF FORMATION THE STEAMING WATER RISES THROUGH FISSURES IN VOLCANIC ROCKS AND IS NOW DEPOSITING IN THE RIFTS A VEIN STONE OF QUARTZ
5401-39508-0041 THE MINERALS OF VEINS ARE THEREFORE CONSTANTLY BEING DISSOLVED ALONG THEIR UPPER PORTIONS AND CARRIED DOWN THE FISSURES BY GROUND WATER TO LOWER LEVELS WHERE THEY ARE REDEPOSITED
5401-39508-0042 LAVAS CONTAIN MINUTE PERCENTAGES OF VARIOUS METALLIC COMPOUNDS AND NO DOUBT THIS WAS THE CASE ALSO WITH THE IGNEOUS ROCKS WHICH FORMED THE ORIGINAL EARTH CRUST BY THE EROSION OF THE IGNEOUS ROCKS THE METALS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED AMONG SEDIMENTARY STRATA
5401-39508-0043 AND EVEN THE SEA HAS TAKEN INTO SOLUTION AN APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF GOLD AND OTHER METALS BUT IN THIS WIDELY DIFFUSED CONDITION THEY ARE WHOLLY USELESS TO MAN THE CONCENTRATION WHICH HAS MADE THEM AVAILABLE IS DUE TO THE INTERACTION OF MANY AGENCIES
5401-39508-0044 EARTH MOVEMENTS FRACTURING DEEPLY THE ROCKS OF THE CRUST THE INTRUSION OF HEATED MASSES THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS HAVE ALL COOPERATED IN THE CONCENTRATION OF THE METALS OF MINERAL VEINS
5401-39508-0045 THUS IN SOLUBLE ROCKS SUCH AS LIMESTONES JOINTS ENLARGED BY PERCOLATING WATER ARE SOMETIMES FILLED WITH METALLIFEROUS DEPOSITS AS FOR EXAMPLE THE LEAD AND ZINC DEPOSITS OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
