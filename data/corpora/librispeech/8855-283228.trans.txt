8855-283228-0000 JUDY'S NEWS PERHAPS MY READER MAY BE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED IN THE PERSON WHO HAVING ONCE BEGUN TO TELL HIS STORY MAY POSSIBLY HAVE ALLOWED HIS FEELINGS IN CONCERT WITH THE COMFORTABLE CONFIDENCE AFFORDED BY THE MASK OF NAMELESSNESS
8855-283228-0001 TO RUN AWAY WITH HIS PEN AND SO HAVE BABBLED OF HIMSELF MORE THAN HE OUGHT MAY BE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED I SAY IN MY MENTAL CONDITION TO CAST A SPECULATIVE THOUGHT UPON THE STATE OF MY MIND DURING MY ILLNESS WITH REGARD TO MISS OLDCASTLE
8855-283228-0002 I DID NOT SUFFER QUITE SO MUCH AS SOME WOULD HAVE SUFFERED DURING SUCH AN ILLNESS BUT I HAVE REASON TO FEAR THAT WHEN I WAS LIGHT HEADED FROM FEVER WHICH WAS A NOT UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY MORNINGS DURING THE WORST OF MY ILLNESS
8855-283228-0003 WHEN MISSUS PEARSON HAD TO SIT UP WITH ME AND SOMETIMES AN OLD WOMAN OF THE VILLAGE WHO WAS GENERALLY CALLED IN UPON SUCH OCCASIONS I MAY HAVE TALKED A GOOD DEAL OF NONSENSE ABOUT MISS OLDCASTLE
8855-283228-0004 AND WHICH NO ONE SEEMING TO CARE ABOUT THEM BUT MYSELF I WAS LEFT TO WANDER THROUGH AT MY OWN LONELY WILL WOULD I COULD SEE WITH THE WAKING EYE SUCH A GRANDEUR OF GOTHIC ARCHES AND LONG DRAWN AISLES
8855-283228-0005 AS THEN AROSE UPON MY SICK SENSE WITHIN WAS A LABYRINTH OF PASSAGES IN THE WALLS AND LONG SOUNDING CORRIDORS AND SUDDEN GALLERIES WHENCE I LOOKED DOWN INTO THE GREAT CHURCH ACHING WITH SILENCE
8855-283228-0006 THROUGH THESE I WAS EVER WANDERING EVER DISCOVERING NEW ROOMS NEW GALLERIES NEW MARVELS OF ARCHITECTURE EVER DISAPPOINTED AND EVER DISSATISFIED BECAUSE I KNEW THAT IN ONE ROOM SOMEWHERE IN THE FORGOTTEN MYSTERIES OF THE PILE
8855-283228-0007 SAT ETHELWYN READING NEVER LIFTING THOSE SEA BLUE EYES OF HERS FROM THE GREAT VOLUME ON HER KNEE READING EVERY WORD SLOWLY TURNING LEAF AFTER LEAF KNEW THAT SHE WOULD SIT THERE READING TILL
8855-283228-0008 RISE AND WALK SLOWLY AWAY AND LEAVE THE GLORIOUS RUIN DEAD TO ME AS IT HAD SO LONG BEEN TO EVERY ONE ELSE KNEW THAT IF I DID NOT FIND HER BEFORE THAT TERRIBLE LAST PAGE WAS READ I SHOULD NEVER FIND HER AT ALL
8855-283228-0009 BUT HAVE TO GO WANDERING ALONE ALL MY LIFE THROUGH THOSE DREARY GALLERIES AND CORRIDORS WITH ONE HOPE ONLY LEFT THAT I MIGHT YET BEFORE I DIED FIND THE PALACE CHAMBER FAR APART
8855-283228-0010 AND SEE THE READ AND FORSAKEN VOLUME LYING ON THE FLOOR WHERE SHE HAD LEFT IT AND THE CHAIR BESIDE IT UPON WHICH SHE HAD SAT SO LONG WAITING FOR SOME ONE IN VAIN AND PERHAPS TO WORDS SPOKEN UNDER THESE IMPRESSIONS MAY PARTLY BE ATTRIBUTED THE FACT
8855-283228-0011 I WAS YET LEFT ANXIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL THERE WAS NO ONE FROM WHOM I COULD ASK ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAMILY AT THE HALL SO THAT I WAS JUST DRIVEN TO THE BEST THING TO TRY TO CAST MY CARE UPON HIM WHO CARED FOR MY CARE
8855-283228-0012 HOW OFTEN DO WE LOOK UPON GOD AS OUR LAST AND FEEBLEST RESOURCE WE GO TO HIM BECAUSE WE HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO AND THEN WE LEARN THAT THE STORMS OF LIFE HAVE DRIVEN US NOT UPON THE ROCKS BUT INTO THE DESIRED HAVEN
8855-283228-0013 THAT WE HAVE BEEN COMPELLED AS TO THE LAST REMAINING SO TO THE BEST THE ONLY THE CENTRAL HELP THE CAUSING CAUSE OF ALL THE HELPS
8855-283228-0014 ONE DAY WHEN HAVING CONSIDERABLY RECOVERED FROM MY SECOND ATTACK I WAS SITTING READING IN MY STUDY WHO SHOULD BE ANNOUNCED BUT MY FRIEND JUDY
8855-283228-0015 EXCLAIMED THE IMPULSIVE GIRL TAKING MY HAND IN BOTH OF HERS AND SITTING DOWN BESIDE ME I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE OF COMING TO SEE YOU BEFORE THOUGH WE'VE ALWAYS MANAGED I MEAN AUNTIE AND I TO HEAR ABOUT YOU I WOULD HAVE COME TO NURSE YOU BUT IT WAS NO USE THINKING OF IT
8855-283228-0016 I SMILED AS I THANKED HER AH YOU THINK BECAUSE I'M SUCH A TOM BOY THAT I COULDN'T NURSE YOU I ONLY WISH I HAD HAD A CHANCE OF LETTING YOU SEE I AM SO SORRY FOR YOU BUT I'M NEARLY WELL NOW JUDY AND I HAVE BEEN TAKEN GOOD CARE OF
8855-283228-0017 BY THAT FRUMPY OLD THING MISSUS PEARSON AND MISSUS PEARSON IS A VERY KIND WOMAN AND AN EXCELLENT NURSE I SAID BUT SHE WOULD NOT HEED ME AND THAT AWFUL OLD WITCH MOTHER GOOSE SHE WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU BAD DREAMS ALL NIGHT SHE SAT BY YOU
8855-283228-0018 WELL GRANNIE IS GRACIOUS TO EVERYBODY BUT AUNTIE WHY ISN'T SHE GRACIOUS TO AUNTIE I DON'T KNOW I ONLY GUESS IS YOUR VISITOR GONE YES LONG AGO DO YOU KNOW I THINK GRANNIE WANTS AUNTIE TO MARRY HIM
8855-283228-0019 AND AUNTIE DOESN'T QUITE LIKE IT BUT HE'S VERY NICE HE'S SO FUNNY HE LL BE BACK AGAIN SOON I DARESAY I DON'T QUITE LIKE HIM NOT SO WELL AS YOU BY A WHOLE HALF MISTER WALTON I WISH YOU WOULD MARRY AUNTIE BUT THAT WOULD NEVER DO
8855-283228-0020 SHE WALKS LIKE A CAT I AM SURE SHE IS BAD DID YOU EVER THINK JUDY WHAT AN AWFUL THING IT IS TO BE BAD IF YOU DID I THINK YOU WOULD BE SO SORRY FOR HER YOU COULD NOT HATE HER AT THE SAME TIME
8855-283228-0021 HOW IS MISTER STODDART THEN NOT WELL AT ALL HE WAS TAKEN ILL BEFORE YOU AND HAS BEEN IN BED AND BY THE FIRESIDE EVER SINCE AUNTIE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM HE IS SO OUT OF SPIRITS IF TO MORROW IS FINE I SHALL GO AND SEE HIM
8855-283228-0022 THANK YOU I BELIEVE THAT'S JUST WHAT AUNTIE WANTED HE WON'T LIKE IT AT FIRST I DARESAY BUT HE'LL COME TO AND YOU'LL DO HIM GOOD YOU DO EVERYBODY GOOD YOU COME NEAR I WISH THAT WERE TRUE JUDY I FEAR IT IS NOT
8855-283228-0023 BUT PRESENTLY HER EYES GREW CLEARER AND I COULD SEE THE SLOW FILM OF A TEAR GATHERING MISTER WALTON SHE SAID I HAVE BEEN TRYING NOT TO BE SELFISH YOU HAVE DONE ME THAT MUCH GOOD
8855-283228-0024 I AM VERY GLAD JUDY DON'T FORGET WHO CAN DO YOU ALL GOOD THERE IS ONE WHO CAN NOT ONLY SHOW YOU WHAT IS RIGHT BUT CAN MAKE YOU ABLE TO DO AND BE WHAT IS RIGHT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HAVE GOT TO LEARN YET JUDY
8855-283228-0025 BUT THERE IS THAT ONE TEACHER EVER READY TO TEACH IF YOU WILL ONLY ASK HIM JUDY DID NOT ANSWER BUT SAT LOOKING FIXEDLY AT THE CARPET SHE WAS THINKING THOUGH I SAW WHO HAS PLAYED THE ORGAN JUDY SINCE YOUR UNCLE WAS TAKEN ILL I ASKED AT LENGTH
8855-283228-0026 AND I DID FEEL VERY READY TO MURMUR LIKE A SPOILT CHILD THAT HAD NOT HAD HIS WAY THINK OF HER THERE AND ME HERE THEN I SAID TO MYSELF AT LAST IT MUST HAVE BEEN SHE THAT PLAYED I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH
8855-283228-0027 THAT LAST TIME I WAS IN CHURCH AND INSTEAD OF THANKING GOD FOR THAT HERE I AM MURMURING THAT HE DID NOT GIVE ME MORE AND THIS CHILD HAS JUST BEEN TELLING ME THAT I HAVE TAUGHT HER TO TRY NOT TO BE SELFISH CERTAINLY I SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF MYSELF
8855-283228-0028 WHEN WAS YOUR UNCLE TAKEN ILL I DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER BUT YOU WILL COME AND SEE HIM TO MORROW AND THEN WE SHALL SEE YOU TOO FOR WE ARE ALWAYS OUT AND IN OF HIS ROOM JUST NOW I WILL COME IF DOCTOR DUNCAN WILL LET ME
8855-283228-0029 PERHAPS HE WILL TAKE ME IN HIS CARRIAGE NO NO DON'T YOU COME WITH HIM UNCLE CAN'T BEAR DOCTORS HE NEVER WAS ILL IN HIS LIFE BEFORE
8855-283228-0030 HE HAD MADE HIM ILL I WISH I COULD SEND THE CARRIAGE FOR YOU BUT I CAN'T YOU KNOW NEVER MIND JUDY I SHALL MANAGE SOMEHOW WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS STAYING WITH YOU DON'T YOU KNOW CAPTAIN GEORGE EVERARD
8855-283228-0031 HE WOULD CHANGE HIS NAME TO OLDCASTLE YOU KNOW WHAT A FOOLISH PAIN LIKE A SPEAR THRUST THEY SENT THROUGH ME THOSE WORDS SPOKEN IN SUCH A TAKEN FOR GRANTED WAY HE'S A RELATION ON GRANNIE'S SIDE MOSTLY I BELIEVE
8855-283228-0032 BUT I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND THE EXPLANATION WHAT MAKES IT HARDER IS THAT ALL THE HUSBANDS AND WIVES IN OUR FAMILY FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS HAVE BEEN MORE OR LESS OF COUSINS OR HALF COUSINS OR SECOND OR THIRD COUSINS
8855-283228-0033 CAPTAIN EVERARD HAS WHAT GRANDMAMMA CALLS A NEAT LITTLE PROPERTY OF HIS OWN FROM HIS MOTHER
8855-283228-0034 FOR HE IS ONLY A THIRD SON ONE OF A CLASS GRANNIE DOES NOT IN GENERAL FEEL VERY FRIENDLY TO I ASSURE YOU MISTER WALTON BUT HIS SECOND BROTHER IS DEAD AND THE ELDEST SOMETHING THE WORSE FOR THE WEAR AS GRANNIE SAYS
8855-283228-0035 OH BUT YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T MATTER RETURNED JUDY WITH BITTERNESS WHAT WILL GRANNIE CARE FOR THAT IT'S NOTHING TO ANYBODY BUT AUNTIE AND SHE MUST GET USED TO IT NOBODY MAKES ANYTHING OF HER
8855-283228-0036 IT WAS ONLY AFTER SHE HAD GONE THAT I THOUGHT HOW ASTOUNDING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ME TO HEAR A GIRL OF HER AGE SHOW SUCH AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH WORLDLINESS AND SCHEMING HAD I NOT BEEN PERSONALLY SO MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT ONE OF THE OBJECTS OF HER REMARKS
8855-283228-0037 AND IF ONLY IT SHOULD TURN OUT THAT SHE HAD LIKEWISE INHERITED HER MOTHER'S FIRMNESS SHE MIGHT RENDER THE BEST POSSIBLE SERVICE TO HER AUNT AGAINST THE OPPRESSION OF HER WILFUL MOTHER HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO GET HERE TO DAY I ASKED AS SHE ROSE TO GO
8855-283228-0038 GRANNIE IS IN LONDON AND THE WOLF IS WITH HER AUNTIE WOULDN'T LEAVE UNCLE THEY HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL IN LONDON OF LATE HAVE THEY NOT YES THEY SAY IT'S ABOUT MONEY OF AUNTIE'S BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
