1765-143010-0000 IT WAS INTOLERABLY UNCHANGED THE DIM DARK TONED ROOM IN AN AGONY OF RECOGNITION MY GLANCE RAN FROM ONE TO ANOTHER OF THE COMFORTABLE FAMILIAR THINGS THAT MY EARTHLY LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED AMONG
1765-143010-0001 INCREDIBLY DISTANT FROM IT ALL AS I ESSENTIALLY WAS I NOTED SHARPLY THAT THE VERY GAPS THAT I MYSELF HAD LEFT IN MY BOOKSHELVES STILL STOOD UNFILLED
1765-143010-0002 THAT THE SOFT AGREEABLE CHUCKLE OF MY OWN LITTLE CLOCK LIKE SOME ELDERLY WOMAN WITH WHOM CONVERSATION HAS BECOME AUTOMATIC WAS UNDIMINISHED UNCHANGED OR SO IT SEEMED AT FIRST
1765-143010-0003 BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN TRIVIAL DIFFERENCES THAT SHORTLY SMOTE ME THE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED TOO TIGHTLY FOR I HAD ALWAYS KEPT THE HOUSE VERY COOL ALTHOUGH I HAD KNOWN THAT THERESA PREFERRED WARM ROOMS AND MY WORK BASKET WAS IN DISORDER
1765-143010-0004 IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS THAT SO SMALL A THING SHOULD HURT ME SO THEN FOR THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE SHADOW FOLDED TRANSITION THE ODD ALTERATION OF MY EMOTIONS BEWILDERED ME FOR AT ONE MOMENT THE PLACE SEEMED SO HUMANLY FAMILIAR
1765-143010-0005 SO DISTINCTLY MY OWN PROPER ENVELOPE THAT FOR LOVE OF IT I COULD HAVE LAID MY CHEEK AGAINST THE WALL WHILE IN THE NEXT I WAS MISERABLY CONSCIOUS OF STRANGE NEW SHRILLNESSES HOW COULD THEY BE ENDURED AND HAD I EVER ENDURED THEM
1765-143010-0006 THOSE HARSH INFLUENCES THAT I NOW PERCEIVED AT THE WINDOW LIGHT AND COLOR SO BLINDING THAT THEY OBSCURED THE FORM OF THE WIND TUMULT SO DISCORDANT THAT ONE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE ROSES OPEN IN THE GARDEN BELOW BUT THERESA DID NOT SEEM TO MIND ANY OF THESE THINGS
1765-143010-0007 DISORDER IT IS TRUE THE DEAR CHILD HAD NEVER MINDED SHE WAS SITTING ALL THIS TIME AT MY DESK AT MY DESK OCCUPIED I COULD ONLY TOO EASILY SURMISE HOW IN THE LIGHT OF MY OWN HABITS OF PRECISION
1765-143010-0008 BUT I BELIEVE THAT I DID NOT REALLY REPROACH THERESA FOR I KNEW THAT HER NOTES WHEN SHE DID WRITE THEM WERE PERHAPS LESS PERFUNCTORY THAN MINE SHE FINISHED THE LAST ONE AS I WATCHED HER AND ADDED IT TO THE HEAP OF BLACK BORDERED ENVELOPES THAT LAY ON THE DESK
1765-143010-0009 POOR GIRL I SAW NOW THAT THEY HAD COST HER TEARS YET LIVING BESIDE HER DAY AFTER DAY YEAR AFTER YEAR I HAD NEVER DISCOVERED WHAT DEEP TENDERNESS MY SISTER POSSESSED TOWARD EACH OTHER IT HAD BEEN OUR HABIT TO DISPLAY ONLY A TEMPERATE AFFECTION
1765-143010-0010 AND I REMEMBER HAVING ALWAYS THOUGHT IT DISTINCTLY FORTUNATE FOR THERESA SINCE SHE WAS DENIED MY HAPPINESS THAT SHE COULD LIVE SO EASILY AND PLEASANTLY WITHOUT EMOTIONS OF THE DEVASTATING SORT AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS REALLY TO BEHOLD HER
1765-143010-0011 COULD IT BE THERESA AFTER ALL THIS TANGLE OF SUBDUED TURBULENCES LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT IT IS AN EASY THING TO BEAR THE RELENTLESSLY LUCID UNDERSTANDING THAT I THEN FIRST EXERCISED
1765-143010-0012 OR THAT IN ITS FIRST ENFRANCHISEMENT THE TIMID VISION DOES NOT YEARN FOR ITS OLD SCREENS AND MISTS SUDDENLY AS THERESA SAT THERE HER HEAD FILLED WITH ITS TENDER THOUGHTS OF ME HELD IN HER GENTLE HANDS
1765-143010-0013 I FELT ALLAN'S STEP ON THE CARPETED STAIR OUTSIDE THERESA FELT IT TOO BUT HOW FOR IT WAS NOT AUDIBLE SHE GAVE A START SWEPT THE BLACK ENVELOPES OUT OF SIGHT AND PRETENDED TO BE WRITING IN A LITTLE BOOK
1765-143010-0014 THEN I FORGOT TO WATCH HER ANY LONGER IN MY ABSORPTION IN ALLAN'S COMING IT WAS HE OF COURSE THAT I WAS AWAITING IT WAS FOR HIM THAT I HAD MADE THIS FIRST LONELY FRIGHTENED EFFORT TO RETURN TO RECOVER
1765-143010-0015 IT WAS NOT THAT I HAD SUPPOSED HE WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO RECOGNIZE MY PRESENCE FOR I HAD LONG BEEN SUFFICIENTLY FAMILIAR WITH HIS HARD AND FAST DENIALS OF THE INVISIBLE HE WAS SO REASONABLE ALWAYS SO SANE SO BLINDFOLDED
1765-143010-0016 BUT I HAD HOPED THAT BECAUSE OF HIS VERY REJECTION OF THE ETHER THAT NOW CONTAINED ME I COULD PERHAPS ALL THE MORE SAFELY THE MORE SECRETLY WATCH HIM LINGER NEAR HIM HE WAS NEAR NOW VERY NEAR
1765-143010-0017 BUT WHY DID THERESA SITTING THERE IN THE ROOM THAT HAD NEVER BELONGED TO HER APPROPRIATE FOR HERSELF HIS COMING IT WAS SO MANIFESTLY I WHO HAD DRAWN HIM I WHOM HE HAD COME TO SEEK THE DOOR WAS AJAR
1765-143010-0018 HE KNOCKED SOFTLY AT IT ARE YOU THERE THERESA HE CALLED HE EXPECTED TO FIND HER THEN THERE IN MY ROOM I SHRANK BACK FEARING ALMOST TO STAY I SHALL HAVE FINISHED IN A MOMENT
1765-143010-0019 THERESA TOLD HIM AND HE SAT DOWN TO WAIT FOR HER NO SPIRIT STILL UNRELEASED CAN UNDERSTAND THE PANG THAT I FELT WITH ALLAN SITTING ALMOST WITHIN MY TOUCH
1765-143010-0020 ALMOST IRRESISTIBLY THE WISH BESET ME TO LET HIM FOR AN INSTANT FEEL MY NEARNESS THEN I CHECKED MYSELF REMEMBERING OH ABSURD PITEOUS HUMAN FEARS THAT MY TOO UNGUARDED CLOSENESS MIGHT ALARM HIM
1765-143010-0021 IT WAS NOT SO REMOTE A TIME THAT I MYSELF HAD KNOWN THEM THOSE BLIND UNCOUTH TIMIDITIES I CAME THEREFORE SOMEWHAT NEARER BUT I DID NOT TOUCH HIM I MERELY LEANED TOWARD HIM AND WITH INCREDIBLE SOFTNESS WHISPERED HIS NAME
1765-143010-0022 THAT MUCH I COULD NOT HAVE FORBORNE THE SPELL OF LIFE WAS STILL TOO STRONG IN ME BUT IT GAVE HIM NO COMFORT NO DELIGHT THERESA HE CALLED IN A VOICE DREADFUL WITH ALARM AND IN THAT INSTANT THE LAST VEIL FELL
1765-143010-0023 AND DESPERATELY SCARCE BELIEVINGLY I BEHELD HOW IT STOOD BETWEEN THEM THOSE TWO SHE TURNED TO HIM THAT GENTLE LOOK OF HERS FORGIVE ME CAME FROM HIM HOARSELY
1765-143010-0024 UNACCOUNTABLE SENSATION CAN THERE BE TOO MANY WINDOWS OPEN THERE IS SUCH A CHILL ABOUT THERE ARE NO WINDOWS OPEN THERESA ASSURED HIM I TOOK CARE TO SHUT OUT THE CHILL YOU ARE NOT WELL ALLAN
1765-143010-0025 PERHAPS NOT HE EMBRACED THE SUGGESTION AND YET I FEEL NO ILLNESS APART FROM THIS ABOMINABLE SENSATION THAT PERSISTS PERSISTS THERESA YOU MUST TELL ME DO I FANCY IT OR DO YOU TOO FEEL SOMETHING
1765-143010-0026 STRANGE HERE OH THERE IS SOMETHING VERY STRANGE HERE SHE HALF SOBBED THERE ALWAYS WILL BE GOOD HEAVENS CHILD I DIDN'T MEAN THAT HE ROSE AND STOOD LOOKING ABOUT HIM
1765-143010-0027 I KNOW OF COURSE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR BELIEFS AND I RESPECT THEM BUT YOU KNOW EQUALLY WELL THAT I HAVE NOTHING OF THE SORT SO DON'T LET US CONJURE UP ANYTHING INEXPLICABLE I STAYED IMPALPABLY IMPONDERABLY NEAR HIM
1765-143010-0028 WRETCHED AND BEREFT THOUGH I WAS I COULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIM WHILE HE STOOD DENYING ME WHAT I MEAN HE WENT ON IN HIS LOW DISTINCT VOICE IS A SPECIAL AN ALMOST OMINOUS SENSE OF COLD
1765-143010-0029 UPON MY SOUL THERESA HE PAUSED IF I WERE SUPERSTITIOUS IF I WERE A WOMAN I SHOULD PROBABLY IMAGINE IT TO SEEM A PRESENCE HE SPOKE THE LAST WORD VERY FAINTLY
1765-143010-0030 BUT THERESA SHRANK FROM IT NEVERTHELESS DON'T SAY THAT ALLAN SHE CRIED OUT
1765-143010-0031 I'VE TRIED SO HARD MYSELF NOT TO THINK IT AND YOU MUST HELP ME YOU KNOW IT IS ONLY PERTURBED UNEASY SPIRITS THAT WANDER WITH HER IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO HAPPY SHE MUST STILL BE I LISTENED STUNNED
1765-143010-0032 TO THERESA'S SWEET DOGMATISM FROM WHAT BLIND DISTANCES CAME HER CONFIDENT MISAPPREHENSIONS HOW DENSE BOTH FOR HER AND FOR ALLAN WAS THE SEPARATING VAPOR ALLAN FROWNED DON'T TAKE ME LITERALLY THERESA HE EXPLAINED
1765-143010-0033 AND I WHO A MOMENT BEFORE HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIM
1765-143010-0034 SPIRITS IT'S SOMETHING MUCH MORE TERRIBLE HE ALLOWED HIS HEAD TO SINK HEAVILY ON HIS CHEST IF I DID NOT POSITIVELY KNOW THAT I HAD NEVER DONE HER ANY HARM I SHOULD SUPPOSE MYSELF TO BE SUFFERING FROM GUILT FROM REMORSE
1765-143010-0035 THERESA YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I PERHAPS WAS SHE CONTENT ALWAYS DID SHE BELIEVE IN ME BELIEVE IN YOU WHEN SHE KNEW YOU TO BE SO GOOD WHEN YOU ADORED HER SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE SAID IT
1765-143010-0036 THEN WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME AILS ME UNLESS IT IS ALL AS YOU BELIEVE THERESA AND SHE KNOWS NOW WHAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW THEN POOR DEAR AND MINDS MINDS WHAT
1765-143010-0037 I WHO WITH MY PERHAPS ILLEGITIMATE ADVANTAGE SAW SO CLEAR KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT MEANT TO TELL HER I DID HIM THAT JUSTICE EVEN IN MY FIRST JEALOUSY IF I HAD NOT TORTURED HIM SO BY CLINGING NEAR HIM HE WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD HER
1765-143010-0038 BUT THE MOMENT CAME AND OVERFLOWED AND HE DID TELL HER PASSIONATE TUMULTUOUS STORY THAT IT WAS DURING ALL OUR LIFE TOGETHER ALLAN'S AND MINE HE HAD SPARED ME HAD KEPT ME WRAPPED IN THE WHITE CLOAK OF AN UNBLEMISHED LOYALTY
1765-143010-0039 BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN KINDER I NOW BITTERLY THOUGHT IF LIKE MANY HUSBANDS HE HAD YEARS AGO FOUND FOR THE STORY HE NOW POURED FORTH SOME CLANDESTINE LISTENER I SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN BUT HE WAS FAITHFUL AND GOOD
1765-143010-0040 AND SO HE WAITED TILL I MUTE AND CHAINED WAS THERE TO HEAR HIM SO WELL DID I KNOW HIM AS I THOUGHT SO THOROUGHLY HAD HE ONCE BEEN MINE THAT I SAW IT IN HIS EYES HEARD IT IN HIS VOICE BEFORE THE WORDS CAME
1765-143010-0041 AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT LASHED ME WITH THE WHIPS OF AN UNBEARABLE HUMILIATION FOR I HIS WIFE HAD NOT KNOWN HOW GREATLY HE COULD LOVE AND THAT THERESA SOFT LITTLE TRAITOR SHOULD IN HER STILL WAY HAVE CARED TOO
1765-143010-0042 FROM THE MOMENT HE BADE HER SHE TURNED HER SOFT LITTLE PETALS UP TO HIM
1765-143010-0043 AND NONE THE LESS SO THAT IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE HAD PROMPTED BY SOME BELATED THOUGHT OF ME RENOUNCED HIM ALLAN WAS HERS YET SHE PUT HIM FROM HER AND IT WAS MY PART TO WATCH THEM BOTH
1765-143010-0044 THEN IN THE ANGUISH OF IT ALL I REMEMBERED AWKWARD UNTUTORED SPIRIT THAT I WAS THAT I NOW HAD THE GREAT RECOURSE WHATEVER HUMAN THINGS WERE UNBEARABLE I HAD NO NEED TO BEAR I CEASED THEREFORE TO MAKE THE EFFORT THAT KEPT ME WITH THEM
1765-143010-0045 THE PITILESS POIGNANCY WAS DULLED THE SOUNDS AND THE LIGHT CEASED THE LOVERS FADED FROM ME AND AGAIN I WAS MERCIFULLY DRAWN INTO THE DIM INFINITE SPACES
1765-143010-0046 THERE FOLLOWED A PERIOD WHOSE LENGTH I CANNOT MEASURE AND DURING WHICH I WAS ABLE TO MAKE NO PROGRESS IN THE DIFFICULT DIZZYING EXPERIENCE OF RELEASE EARTH BOUND MY JEALOUSY RELENTLESSLY KEPT ME
1765-143010-0047 THOUGH MY TWO DEAR ONES HAD FORSWORN EACH OTHER I COULD NOT TRUST THEM FOR THEIRS SEEMED TO ME AN AFFECTATION OF A MORE THAN MORTAL MAGNANIMITY
1765-143010-0048 I COULD MANIFEST MYSELF AS PALELY AS TRANSIENTLY AS A THOUGHT I COULD PRODUCE THE MEREST NECESSARY FLICKER LIKE THE SHADOW OF A JUST OPENED LEAF ON HIS TREMBLING TORTURED CONSCIOUSNESS
1765-143010-0049 AND THESE UNREALIZED PERCEPTIONS OF ME HE INTERPRETED AS I HAD KNOWN THAT HE WOULD AS HIS SOUL'S INEVITABLE PENANCE HE HAD COME TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD DONE EVIL IN SILENTLY LOVING THERESA ALL THESE YEARS
1765-143010-0050 AND IT WAS MY VENGEANCE TO ALLOW HIM TO BELIEVE THIS TO PROD HIM EVER TO BELIEVE IT AFRESH I AM CONSCIOUS THAT THIS FRAME OF MIND WAS NOT CONTINUOUS IN ME FOR I REMEMBER TOO THAT WHEN ALLAN AND THERESA WERE SAFELY APART AND SUFFICIENTLY MISERABLE
1765-143010-0051 I LOVED THEM AS DEARLY AS I EVER HAD MORE DEARLY PERHAPS FOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD NOT PERCEIVE IN MY NEW EMANCIPATION THAT THEY WERE EACH OF THEM SOMETHING MORE AND GREATER THAN THE TWO BEINGS I HAD ONCE IGNORANTLY PICTURED THEM
1765-143010-0052 FOR YEARS THEY HAD PRACTICED A SELFLESSNESS OF WHICH I COULD ONCE SCARCELY HAVE CONCEIVED AND WHICH EVEN NOW I COULD ONLY ADMIRE WITHOUT ENTERING INTO ITS MYSTERY WHILE I HAD LIVED SOLELY FOR MYSELF THESE TWO DIVINE CREATURES HAD LIVED EXQUISITELY FOR ME
1765-143010-0053 THEY HAD GRANTED ME EVERYTHING THEMSELVES NOTHING FOR MY UNDESERVING SAKE THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN A CONSTANT TORMENT OF RENUNCIATION A TORMENT THEY HAD NOT SOUGHT TO ALLEVIATE BY THE EXCHANGE OF A SINGLE GLANCE OF UNDERSTANDING
1765-143010-0054 THERE WERE EVEN MARVELOUS MOMENTS WHEN FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY NEWLY INFORMED HEART I PITIED THEM POOR CREATURES WHO WITHHELD FROM THE INFINITE SOLACES THAT I HAD COME TO KNOW WERE STILL UTTERLY WITHIN THAT SHELL OF SENSE
1765-143010-0055 SO FRAIL SO PITEOUSLY CONTRIVED FOR PAIN WITHIN IT YES YET EXERCISING QUALITIES THAT SO SUBLIMELY TRANSCENDED IT
1765-143010-0056 YET THE SHY HESITATING COMPASSION THAT THUS HAD BIRTH IN ME WAS FAR FROM BEING ABLE TO DEFEAT THE EARLIER EARTHLIER EMOTION THE TWO I RECOGNIZED WERE IN A SORT OF CONFLICT AND I REGARDING IT ASSUMED THAT THE CONFLICT WOULD NEVER END
1765-143010-0057 THAT FOR YEARS AS ALLAN AND THERESA RECKONED TIME I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO WITHHOLD MYSELF FROM THE GREAT SPACES AND LINGER SUFFERING GRUDGING SHAMED WHERE THEY LINGERED IT CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED I SUPPOSE
1765-143010-0058 WHAT TO DEVITALIZED PERCEPTION SUCH AS MINE THE CONTACT OF MORTAL BEINGS WITH EACH OTHER APPEARS TO BE ONCE TO HAVE EXERCISED THIS SENSE FREED PERCEPTION IS TO REALIZE THAT THE GIFT OF PROPHECY ALTHOUGH THE SUBJECT OF SUCH FREQUENT MARVEL IS NO LONGER MYSTERIOUS
1765-143010-0059 THE MEREST GLANCE OF OUR SENSITIVE AND UNCLOYED VISION CAN DETECT THE STRENGTH OF THE RELATION BETWEEN TWO BEINGS AND THEREFORE INSTANTLY CALCULATE ITS DURATION IF YOU SEE A HEAVY WEIGHT SUSPENDED FROM A SLENDER STRING
1765-143010-0060 THAT IN A FEW MOMENTS THE STRING WILL SNAP WELL SUCH IF YOU ADMIT THE ANALOGY IS PROPHECY IS FOREKNOWLEDGE AND IT WAS THUS THAT I SAW IT WITH THERESA AND ALLAN
1765-143010-0061 FOR IT WAS PERFECTLY VISIBLE TO ME THAT THEY WOULD VERY LITTLE LONGER HAVE THE STRENGTH TO PRESERVE NEAR EACH OTHER
1765-143010-0062 AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SEPARATE IT WAS MY SISTER PERHAPS THE MORE SENSITIVE WHO FIRST REALIZED THIS IT HAD NOW BECOME POSSIBLE FOR ME TO OBSERVE THEM ALMOST CONSTANTLY THE EFFORT NECESSARY TO VISIT THEM HAD SO GREATLY DIMINISHED
1765-143010-0063 SO THAT I WATCHED HER POOR ANGUISHED GIRL PREPARE TO LEAVE HIM I SAW EACH RELUCTANT MOVEMENT THAT SHE MADE I SAW HER EYES WORN FROM SELF SEARCHING I HEARD HER STEP GROWN TIMID FROM INEXPLICABLE FEARS
1765-143010-0064 I ENTERED HER VERY HEART AND HEARD ITS PITIFUL WILD BEATING AND STILL I DID NOT INTERFERE
1765-143010-0065 AT ANY MOMENT I COULD HAVE CHECKED THEIR MISERIES COULD HAVE RESTORED HAPPINESS AND PEACE YET IT GAVE ME AND I COULD WEEP TO ADMIT IT A MONSTROUS JOY TO KNOW THAT THERESA THOUGHT SHE WAS LEAVING ALLAN OF HER OWN FREE INTENTION WHEN IT WAS I WHO WAS CONTRIVING
1765-143010-0066 ARRANGING INSISTING AND YET SHE WRETCHEDLY FELT MY PRESENCE NEAR HER I AM CERTAIN OF THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TIME OF HER INTENDED DEPARTURE MY SISTER TOLD ALLAN THAT SHE MUST SPEAK WITH HIM AFTER DINNER
1765-143010-0067 OUR BEAUTIFUL OLD HOUSE BRANCHED OUT FROM A CIRCULAR HALL WITH GREAT ARCHED DOORS AT EITHER END AND IT WAS THROUGH THE REAR DOORWAY THAT ALWAYS IN SUMMER AFTER DINNER WE PASSED OUT INTO THE GARDEN ADJOINING AS USUAL THEREFORE WHEN THE HOUR CAME THERESA LED THE WAY
1765-143010-0068 THAT DREADFUL DAYTIME BRILLIANCE THAT IN MY PRESENT STATE I FOUND SO HARD TO ENDURE WAS NOW BECOMING SOFTER A DELICATE CAPRICIOUS TWILIGHT BREEZE DANCED INCONSEQUENTLY THROUGH LANGUIDLY WHISPERING LEAVES
1765-143010-0069 AND OVER THEM THE BREATH OF MIGNONETTE HUNG HEAVILY IT WAS A PERFECT PLACE AND IT HAD SO LONG BEEN OURS ALLAN'S AND MINE IT MADE ME RESTLESS AND A LITTLE WICKED THAT THOSE TWO SHOULD BE THERE TOGETHER NOW
1765-143010-0070 FOR A LITTLE THEY WALKED ABOUT TOGETHER SPEAKING OF COMMON DAILY THINGS THEN SUDDENLY THERESA BURST OUT I AM GOING AWAY ALLAN I HAVE STAYED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE NOW YOUR MOTHER WILL BE HERE TO CARE FOR YOU AND IT IS TIME FOR ME TO GO
1765-143010-0071 HE STARED AT HER AND STOOD STILL THERESA HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG SHE SO DEFINITELY TO HIS MIND BELONGED THERE AND SHE WAS AS I ALSO HAD JEALOUSLY KNOWN SO LOVELY THERE
1765-143010-0072 THE SMALL DARK DAINTY CREATURE IN THE OLD HALL ON THE WIDE STAIRCASES IN THE GARDEN LIFE THERE WITHOUT THERESA EVEN THE INTENTIONALLY REMOTE THE PERPETUALLY RENOUNCED THERESA HE HAD NOT DREAMED OF IT HE COULD NOT SO SUDDENLY CONCEIVE OF IT
1765-143010-0073 SIT HERE HE SAID AND DREW HER DOWN BESIDE HIM ON A BENCH AND TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS WHY YOU ARE GOING IS IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT I HAVE BEEN HAVE DONE SHE HESITATED
1765-143010-0074 I WONDERED IF SHE WOULD DARE TELL HIM SHE LOOKED OUT AND AWAY FROM HIM AND HE WAITED LONG FOR HER TO SPEAK THE PALE STARS WERE SLIDING INTO THEIR PLACES THE WHISPERING OF THE LEAVES WAS ALMOST HUSHED
1765-143010-0075 ALL ABOUT THEM IT WAS STILL AND SHADOWY AND SWEET IT WAS THAT WONDERFUL MOMENT WHEN FOR LACK OF A VISIBLE HORIZON THE NOT YET DARKENED WORLD SEEMS INFINITELY GREATER A MOMENT WHEN ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ANYTHING BE BELIEVED IN
1765-143010-0076 TO ME WATCHING LISTENING HOVERING THERE CAME A DREADFUL PURPOSE AND A DREADFUL COURAGE SUPPOSE FOR ONE MOMENT THERESA SHOULD NOT ONLY FEEL BUT SEE ME WOULD SHE DARE TO TELL HIM THEN
1765-143010-0077 THERE CAME A BRIEF SPACE OF TERRIBLE EFFORT ALL MY FLUTTERING UNCERTAIN FORCES STRAINED TO THE UTMOST THE INSTANT OF MY STRUGGLE WAS ENDLESSLY LONG AND THE TRANSITION SEEMED TO TAKE PLACE OUTSIDE ME
1765-143010-0078 AS ONE SITTING IN A TRAIN MOTIONLESS SEES THE LEAGUES OF EARTH FLOAT BY AND THEN IN A BRIGHT TERRIBLE FLASH I KNEW I HAD ACHIEVED IT I HAD ATTAINED VISIBILITY
1765-143010-0079 SHE GAVE A CRY AND THEN THING OF SILLY CRUEL IMPULSES THAT I WAS I SAW WHAT I HAD DONE THE VERY THING THAT I WISHED TO AVERT I HAD PRECIPITATED FOR ALLAN IN HIS SUDDEN TERROR AND PITY HAD BENT AND CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WERE TOGETHER
1765-143010-0080 THEN TO HIS WHISPERED URGING TO TELL THE REASON OF HER CRY THERESA SAID FRANCES WAS HERE
1765-143010-0081 MY DEAR MY DEAR
1765-143010-0082 HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS RIGHT I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS SHE ASKED HIM CALMLY DEAR THERESA ALLAN SAID SLOWLY IF YOU AND I SHOULD GO AWAY SOMEWHERE COULD WE NOT EVADE ALL THIS GHOSTLINESS
1765-143010-0083 AND WILL YOU COME WITH ME DISTANCE WOULD NOT BANISH HER MY SISTER CONFIDENTLY ASSERTED AND THEN SHE SAID SOFTLY HAVE YOU THOUGHT WHAT A LONELY AWESOME THING IT MUST BE TO BE SO NEWLY DEAD
1765-143010-0084 PITY HER ALLAN WE WHO ARE WARM AND ALIVE SHOULD PITY HER
1765-143010-0085 IT WAS YOUR FACE THAT I SAW ALLAN SOLEMNLY TOLD HER OH HOW DIFFERENT HE HAD GROWN FROM THE ALLAN THAT I HAD KNOWN AND YOURS IS THE ONLY FACE THAT I SHALL EVER SEE AND AGAIN HE DREW HER TO HIM
1765-143010-0086 SHE SPRANG FROM HIM YOU ARE DEFYING HER ALLAN SHE CRIED AND YOU MUST NOT IT IS HER RIGHT TO KEEP US APART IF SHE WISHES IT MUST BE AS SHE INSISTS I SHALL GO AS I TOLD YOU
1765-143010-0087 THEY STOOD FACING EACH OTHER IN THE DEEP DUSK AND THE WOUNDS THAT I HAD DEALT THEM GAPED RED AND ACCUSING WE MUST PITY HER THERESA HAD SAID AND AS I REMEMBERED THAT EXTRAORDINARY SPEECH AND SAW THE AGONY IN HER FACE
1765-143010-0088 AND THE GREATER AGONY IN ALLAN'S THERE CAME THE GREAT IRREPARABLE CLEAVAGE BETWEEN MORTALITY AND ME IN A SWIFT MERCIFUL FLAME THE LAST OF MY MORTAL EMOTIONS GROSS AND TENACIOUS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN WAS CONSUMED
1765-143010-0089 MY COLD GRASP OF ALLAN LOOSENED AND A NEW UNEARTHLY LOVE OF HIM BLOOMED IN MY HEART I WAS NOW HOWEVER IN A DIFFICULTY WITH WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IN THE NEWER STATE WAS SCARCELY SUFFICIENT TO DEAL
1765-143010-0090 HOW COULD I MAKE IT PLAIN TO ALLAN AND THERESA THAT I WISHED TO BRING THEM TOGETHER TO HEAL THE WOUNDS THAT I HAD MADE PITYINGLY REMORSEFULLY I LINGERED NEAR THEM ALL THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY
1765-143010-0091 AND BY THAT TIME HAD BROUGHT MYSELF TO THE POINT OF A GREAT DETERMINATION IN THE LITTLE TIME THAT WAS LEFT BEFORE THERESA SHOULD BE GONE AND ALLAN BEREFT AND DESOLATE
1765-143010-0092 WHEN THEY THINK OF ME ALLAN AND THERESA I PRAY NOW THAT THEY WILL RECALL WHAT I DID THAT NIGHT AND THAT MY THOUSAND FRUSTRATIONS AND SELFISHNESSES MAY SHRIVEL AND BE BLOWN FROM THEIR INDULGENT MEMORIES
1765-143010-0093 ABOVE IN HER ROOM THERE WERE THE SOUNDS OF DEPARTURE THEY SPOKE LITTLE DURING THE BRIEF MEAL BUT WHEN IT WAS ENDED ALLAN SAID THERESA THERE IS HALF AN HOUR BEFORE YOU GO WILL YOU COME UPSTAIRS WITH ME I HAD A DREAM THAT I MUST TELL YOU OF
1765-143010-0094 ALLAN SHE LOOKED AT HIM FRIGHTENED BUT WENT WITH HIM IT WAS OF FRANCES YOU DREAMED SHE SAID QUIETLY AS THEY ENTERED THE LIBRARY TOGETHER DID I SAY IT WAS A DREAM BUT I WAS AWAKE THOROUGHLY AWAKE
1765-143010-0095 I HAD NOT BEEN SLEEPING WELL AND I HEARD TWICE THE STRIKING OF THE CLOCK
1765-143010-0096 THINKING OF YOU THERESA SHE CAME TO ME STOOD THERE BEFORE ME IN MY ROOM IT WAS NO SHEETED SPECTER YOU UNDERSTAND IT WAS FRANCES LITERALLY SHE IN SOME INEXPLICABLE FASHION I SEEMED TO BE AWARE THAT SHE WANTED TO MAKE ME KNOW SOMETHING
1765-143010-0097 WATCHING HER FACE AFTER A FEW MOMENTS IT CAME SHE DID NOT SPEAK PRECISELY THAT IS I AM SURE I HEARD NO SOUND YET THE WORDS THAT CAME FROM HER WERE DEFINITE ENOUGH SHE SAID DON'T LET THERESA LEAVE YOU
1765-143010-0098 THEN SHE WENT AWAY WAS THAT A DREAM I HAD NOT MEANT TO TELL YOU THERESA EAGERLY ANSWERED BUT NOW I MUST IT IS TOO WONDERFUL WHAT TIME DID YOUR CLOCK STRIKE ALLAN
1765-143010-0099 ONE THE LAST TIME YES IT WAS THEN THAT I AWOKE AND SHE HAD BEEN WITH ME I HAD NOT SEEN HER BUT HER ARM HAD BEEN ABOUT ME AND HER KISS WAS ON MY CHEEK OH I KNEW IT WAS UNMISTAKABLE AND THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WAS WITH ME
1765-143010-0100 THEN SHE BADE YOU TOO YES TO STAY WITH YOU I AM GLAD WE TOLD EACH OTHER SHE SMILED TEARFULLY AND BEGAN TO FASTEN HER WRAP BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING NOW ALLAN CRIED
1765-143010-0101 YOU KNOW THAT YOU CANNOT NOW THAT SHE HAS ASKED YOU TO STAY THEN YOU BELIEVE AS I DO THAT IT WAS SHE THERESA DEMANDED I CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND BUT I KNOW HE ANSWERED HER AND NOW YOU WILL NOT GO
1765-143010-0102 I AM FREED THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER SEMBLANCE OF ME IN MY OLD HOME NO SOUND OF MY VOICE NO DIMMEST ECHO OF MY EARTHLY SELF
