3003-12539-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE FINDING AND LOSING A FORTUNE OUR YOUTHFUL DREAM OF BECOMING FARMERS WAS NOW REALIZED IN FULLEST MEASURE THE CLEARING WAS GRADUALLY ENLARGED AND ABUNDANT CROPS CAME TO REWARD OUR EFFORTS
3003-12539-0001 THE COMFORT AND PLENTY WE HAD HOPED AND STRUGGLED FOR WAS ATTAINED NEXT CAME A DEVELOPMENT IN THE FAMILY FORTUNES THAT WE HAD NOT DREAMED OF NEVER HAD WE THOUGHT TO SEE THE MEEKER FAMILY CONDUCTING A BUSINESS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LONDON OFFICE
3003-12539-0002 THIS UNEXPECTED PROSPERITY CAME TO US THROUGH THE HOP GROWING INDUSTRY UPON WHICH WE ENTERED WITH ALL OUR FORCE THE BUSINESS WAS WELL STARTED BY THE TIME OF MY FATHER'S DEATH IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE AND IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS FOLLOWING
3003-12539-0003 THE ACREAGE PLANTED TO HOPS WAS INCREASED UNTIL THE CROP YIELD OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO A YIELD OF MORE THAN SEVENTY ONE TONS GAVE THE PUYALLUP VALLEY THE BANNER CROP AS TO QUANTITY OF THE UNITED STATES
3003-12539-0004 AND SOME PERSONS ASSERTED OF THE WORLD THE PUBLIC GENERALLY GAVE ME THE CREDIT OF INTRODUCING HOP CULTURE INTO THE NORTHWEST THEREFORE IT SEEMS FITTING TO TELL HERE THE STORY OF THE BEGINNINGS OF AN INDUSTRY
3003-12539-0005 THAT CAME TO HAVE GREAT IMPORTANCE IN MARCH OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE CHARLES WOOD OF OLYMPIA
3003-12539-0006 JACOB R MEEKER WHO THEN LIVED ON HIS CLAIM IN THE PUYALLUP VALLEY JOHN V MEEKER MY BROTHER PASSED BY MY CABIN WHEN HE CARRIED THE SACK OF ROOTS ON HIS BACK
3003-12539-0007 A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWENTY MILES AND FROM THE SACK I TOOK ROOTS ENOUGH TO PLANT SIX HILLS OF HOPS
3003-12539-0008 MY FATHER PLANTED THE REMAINDER
3003-12539-0009 THIS WAS SOLD FOR EIGHTY FIVE CENTS A POUND OR A LITTLE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THE BALE THIS SUM WAS MORE MONEY THAN HAD BEEN RECEIVED BY ANY OF THE SETTLERS IN THE PUYALLUP VALLEY EXCEPT PERHAPS TWO
3003-12539-0010 BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PLANT AN ACRE THE FOLLOWING YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN I PLANTED FOUR ACRES AND FOR TWENTY SIX SUCCESSIVE YEARS THEREAFTER WE ADDED TO THE AREA PLANTED
3003-12539-0011 BUT SEEING THAT THERE WERE POSSIBILITIES OF GREAT GAIN I TOOK PAINS TO STUDY HOP CULTURE AND FOUND THAT BY ALLOWING OUR HOPS TO MATURE THOROUGHLY CURING THEM AT A LOW TEMPERATURE AND BALING THEM WHILE HOT
3003-12539-0012 WHICH BROUGHT AN AVERAGE OF SEVENTY CENTS A POUND MY FIRST HOP HOUSE WAS BUILT IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT A LOG HOUSE IT STILL STANDS IN PIONEER PARK IN PUYALLUP
3003-12539-0013 WE FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE DURING HARVEST TIME MANY OF THESE WERE INDIANS SOME OF WHOM WOULD COME FOR A THOUSAND MILES DOWN THE COAST FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA AND EVEN THE CONFINES OF ALASKA
3003-12539-0014 THEY CAME IN THE GREAT CEDAR LOG CANOES MANNED WITH TWENTY PADDLERS OR MORE FOR THE MOST PART I MANAGED MY INDIAN WORKERS VERY EASILY ONCE I HAD TO TIE UP TWO OF THEM TO A TREE FOR GETTING DRUNK THEIR FRIENDS CAME AND STOLE AWAY THE PRISONERS
3003-12539-0015 WHICH WAS WHAT I INTENDED THEY SHOULD DO IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHTEEN YEARS AFTER MY ARRIVAL FROM ACROSS THE PLAINS THAT I MADE MY FIRST RETURN JOURNEY TO THE STATES I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE MUD TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER
3003-12539-0016 THEN OUT OVER THE BAR TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND DOWN TO SAN FRANCISCO THEN THERE WAS THE SEVEN DAYS JOURNEY OVER THE CENTRAL AND UNION PACIFIC AND CONNECTING LINES THIS MEANT SITTING BOLT UPRIGHT ALL THE WAY
3003-12539-0017 FOR THERE WERE NO SLEEPING CARS THEN AND NO DINERS EITHER ABOUT EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO I HAD COME TO REALIZE THAT THE IMPORTANT MARKET FOR HOPS WAS IN ENGLAND
3003-12539-0018 FIRST SEVEN BALES THEN THE FOLLOWING YEAR FIVE HUNDRED BALES THEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED FINALLY OUR ANNUAL SHIPMENTS REACHED ELEVEN THOUSAND BALES A YEAR OR THE EQUIVALENT IN VALUE OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
3003-12539-0019 SAID AT THAT TIME TO BE THE LARGEST EXPORT HOP BUSINESS
3003-12539-0020 AT ONE TIME I HAD TWO FULL TRAINLOADS BETWEEN THE PACIFIC AND THE ATLANTIC ON THEIR WAY TO LONDON I SPENT FOUR WINTERS IN LONDON DEALING IN THE HOP MARKET LITTLE AS I HAD THOUGHT EVER TO HANDLE AN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
3003-12539-0021 STILL LESS HAD I THOUGHT EVER TO WRITE A BOOK MY FIRST PUBLICATION WAS AN EIGHTY PAGE PAMPHLET DESCRIPTIVE OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY PRINTED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY MY FIRST REAL BOOK HOP CULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES
3003-12539-0022 WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE I MENTION THIS FACT SIMPLY AS ONE INSTANCE OUT OF THE MANY THAT COULD BE GIVEN OF THE UNEXPECTED LINES OF DEVELOPMENT THAT LIFE IN THE NEW LAND OPENED OUT TO THE PIONEERS
3003-12539-0023 THE HOP BUSINESS COULD NOT BE CALLED A VENTURE IT WAS SIMPLY A GROWTH THE CONDITIONS WERE FAVORABLE TO US IN THAT WE COULD PRODUCE HOPS FOR THE WORLD'S MARKET AT THE LOWEST PRICES
3003-12539-0024 WE ACTUALLY PRESSED THE ENGLISH GROWERS SO CLOSELY THAT MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF HOPS WERE DESTROYED IN THAT COUNTRY OUR GREAT PROSPERITY WAS NOT TO LAST ONE EVENING IN EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO
3003-12539-0025 AS I STEPPED OUT OF MY OFFICE AND CAST MY EYES TOWARD ONE GROUP OF HOP HOUSES IT STRUCK ME THAT THE HOP FOLIAGE OF A FIELD NEAR BY WAS OFF COLOR DID NOT LOOK NATURAL ONE OF MY CLERKS FROM THE OFFICE SAID THE SAME THING
3003-12539-0026 THE VINES DID NOT LOOK NATURAL I WALKED DOWN TO THE YARDS A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY AND THERE FIRST SAW THE HOP LOUSE THE YARD WAS LITERALLY ALIVE WITH LICE
3003-12539-0027 AND THEY WERE DESTROYING AT LEAST THE QUALITY OF THE HOPS I ISSUED A HOP CIRCULAR SENDING IT TO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED CORRESPONDENTS ALL ALONG THE COAST IN CALIFORNIA OREGON WASHINGTON AND BRITISH COLUMBIA
3003-12539-0028 AND BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT I BEGAN TO RECEIVE SAMPLES FROM THEM AND LETTERS ASKING WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE HOPS IT APPEARED THAT THE ATTACK OF LICE WAS SIMULTANEOUS IN OREGON WASHINGTON AND BRITISH COLUMBIA
3003-12539-0029 I SENT MY SECOND SON FRED MEEKER TO LONDON TO LEARN THE ENGLISH METHODS OF FIGHTING THE PEST AND TO IMPORT SOME SPRAYING MACHINERY WE FOUND TO OUR COST HOWEVER IN THE COURSE OF TIME
3003-12539-0030 THAT THE ENGLISH METHODS DID NOT SUIT OUR DIFFERENT CONDITIONS FOR WHILE WE COULD KILL THE LICE WE HAD TO USE SO MUCH SPRAYING MATERIAL ON THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT IN KILLING THEM WE VIRTUALLY DESTROYED THE HOPS
3003-12539-0031 INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO SELL OUR HOPS AT THE TOP PRICE OF THE MARKET WE SAW OUR PRODUCT FALL TO THE FOOT OF THE LIST THE LAST CROP I RAISED COST ME ELEVEN CENTS A POUND AND SOLD FOR THREE
3003-12539-0032 UNDER THE HAMMER AT SHERIFF'S SALE AT THAT TIME I HAD ADVANCED TO MY NEIGHBORS AND OTHERS UPON THEIR HOP CROPS MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WAS LOST THESE PEOPLE SIMPLY COULD NOT PAY
3003-12539-0033 AND I FORGAVE THE DEBT TAKING NO JUDGMENTS AGAINST THEM AND I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED THE ACTION ALL MY ACCUMULATIONS WERE SWEPT AWAY AND I QUIT THE BUSINESS OR RATHER THE BUSINESS QUIT ME
