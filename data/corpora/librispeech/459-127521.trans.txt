459-127521-0000 PART THREE MY SHORE ADVENTURE
459-127521-0001 HOW MY SHORE ADVENTURE BEGAN THE APPEARANCE OF THE ISLAND WHEN I CAME ON DECK NEXT MORNING WAS ALTOGETHER CHANGED ALTHOUGH THE BREEZE HAD NOW UTTERLY CEASED
459-127521-0002 THIS EVEN TINT WAS INDEED BROKEN UP BY STREAKS OF YELLOW SAND BREAK IN THE LOWER LANDS AND BY MANY TALL TREES OF THE PINE FAMILY OUT TOPPING THE OTHERS SOME SINGLY SOME IN CLUMPS BUT THE GENERAL COLOURING WAS UNIFORM AND SAD
459-127521-0003 THE HILLS RAN UP CLEAR ABOVE THE VEGETATION IN SPIRES OF NAKED ROCK ALL WERE STRANGELY SHAPED AND THE SPY GLASS WHICH WAS BY THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED FEET THE TALLEST ON THE ISLAND WAS LIKEWISE THE STRANGEST IN CONFIGURATION
459-127521-0004 THE BOOMS WERE TEARING AT THE BLOCKS THE RUDDER WAS BANGING TO AND FRO AND THE WHOLE SHIP CREAKING GROANING AND JUMPING LIKE A MANUFACTORY
459-127521-0005 WAS A THING I NEVER LEARNED TO STAND WITHOUT A QUALM OR SO ABOVE ALL IN THE MORNING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH PERHAPS IT WAS THIS PERHAPS IT WAS THE LOOK OF THE ISLAND WITH ITS GREY MELANCHOLY WOODS AND WILD STONE SPIRES
459-127521-0006 AND THE SURF THAT WE COULD BOTH SEE AND HEAR FOAMING AND THUNDERING ON THE STEEP BEACH AT LEAST ALTHOUGH THE SUN SHONE BRIGHT AND HOT AND THE SHORE BIRDS WERE FISHING AND CRYING ALL AROUND US
459-127521-0007 AND THE BOATS HAD TO BE GOT OUT AND MANNED AND THE SHIP WARPED THREE OR FOUR MILES ROUND THE CORNER OF THE ISLAND AND UP THE NARROW PASSAGE TO THE HAVEN BEHIND SKELETON ISLAND I VOLUNTEERED FOR ONE OF THE BOATS WHERE I HAD OF COURSE NO BUSINESS
459-127521-0008 THE HEAT WAS SWELTERING AND THE MEN GRUMBLED FIERCELY OVER THEIR WORK ANDERSON WAS IN COMMAND OF MY BOAT AND INSTEAD OF KEEPING THE CREW IN ORDER HE GRUMBLED AS LOUD AS THE WORST WELL HE SAID WITH AN OATH IT'S NOT FOREVER
459-127521-0009 I THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY BAD SIGN FOR UP TO THAT DAY THE MEN HAD GONE BRISKLY AND WILLINGLY ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS BUT THE VERY SIGHT OF THE ISLAND HAD RELAXED THE CORDS OF DISCIPLINE ALL THE WAY IN LONG JOHN STOOD BY THE STEERSMAN AND CONNED THE SHIP
459-127521-0010 HE KNEW THE PASSAGE LIKE THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND THOUGH THE MAN IN THE CHAINS GOT EVERYWHERE MORE WATER THAN WAS DOWN IN THE CHART JOHN NEVER HESITATED ONCE THERE'S A STRONG SCOUR WITH THE EBB HE SAID
459-127521-0011 THE PLUNGE OF OUR ANCHOR SENT UP CLOUDS OF BIRDS WHEELING AND CRYING OVER THE WOODS BUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE THEY WERE DOWN AGAIN AND ALL WAS ONCE MORE SILENT THE PLACE WAS ENTIRELY LAND LOCKED BURIED IN WOODS
459-127521-0012 WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER ANCHORED THERE SINCE THE ISLAND AROSE OUT OF THE SEAS THERE WAS NOT A BREATH OF AIR MOVING NOR A SOUND BUT THAT OF THE SURF BOOMING HALF A MILE AWAY ALONG THE BEACHES AND AGAINST THE ROCKS OUTSIDE
459-127521-0013 A PECULIAR STAGNANT SMELL HUNG OVER THE ANCHORAGE A SMELL OF SODDEN LEAVES AND ROTTING TREE TRUNKS I OBSERVED THE DOCTOR SNIFFING AND SNIFFING LIKE SOMEONE TASTING A BAD EGG I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TREASURE HE SAID
459-127521-0014 BUT I'LL STAKE MY WIG THERE'S FEVER HERE IF THE CONDUCT OF THE MEN HAD BEEN ALARMING IN THE BOAT IT BECAME TRULY THREATENING WHEN THEY HAD COME ABOARD THEY LAY ABOUT THE DECK GROWLING TOGETHER IN TALK
459-127521-0015 THE SLIGHTEST ORDER WAS RECEIVED WITH A BLACK LOOK AND GRUDGINGLY AND CARELESSLY OBEYED EVEN THE HONEST HANDS MUST HAVE CAUGHT THE INFECTION FOR THERE WAS NOT ONE MAN ABOARD TO MEND ANOTHER MUTINY IT WAS PLAIN
459-127521-0016 HUNG OVER US LIKE A THUNDER CLOUD AND IT WAS NOT ONLY WE OF THE CABIN PARTY WHO PERCEIVED THE DANGER LONG JOHN WAS HARD AT WORK GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP SPENDING HIMSELF IN GOOD ADVICE AND AS FOR EXAMPLE NO MAN COULD HAVE SHOWN A BETTER
459-127521-0017 HE FAIRLY OUTSTRIPPED HIMSELF IN WILLINGNESS AND CIVILITY HE WAS ALL SMILES TO EVERYONE IF AN ORDER WERE GIVEN
459-127521-0018 APPEARED THE WORST WE HELD A COUNCIL IN THE CABIN SIR SAID THE CAPTAIN IF I RISK ANOTHER ORDER THE WHOLE SHIP'LL COME ABOUT OUR EARS BY THE RUN YOU SEE SIR HERE IT IS I GET A ROUGH ANSWER DO I NOT
459-127521-0019 WELL IF I SPEAK BACK PIKES WILL BE GOING IN TWO SHAKES IF I DON'T SILVER WILL SEE THERE'S SOMETHING UNDER THAT AND THE GAME'S UP NOW WE'VE ONLY ONE MAN TO RELY ON AND WHO IS THAT ASKED THE SQUIRE SILVER SIR RETURNED THE CAPTAIN
459-127521-0020 IF THEY NONE OF THEM GO WELL THEN WE HOLD THE CABIN AND GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT IF SOME GO YOU MARK MY WORDS SIR SILVER'LL BRING EM ABOARD AGAIN AS MILD AS LAMBS IT WAS SO DECIDED
459-127521-0021 LOADED PISTOLS WERE SERVED OUT TO ALL THE SURE MEN HUNTER JOYCE AND REDRUTH WERE TAKEN INTO OUR CONFIDENCE AND RECEIVED THE NEWS WITH LESS SURPRISE AND A BETTER SPIRIT THAN WE HAD LOOKED FOR AND THEN THE CAPTAIN WENT ON DECK AND ADDRESSED THE CREW
459-127521-0022 MY LADS SAID HE WE'VE HAD A HOT DAY AND ARE ALL TIRED AND OUT OF SORTS A TURN ASHORE'LL HURT NOBODY THE BOATS ARE STILL IN THE WATER YOU CAN TAKE THE GIGS AND AS MANY AS PLEASE MAY GO ASHORE FOR THE AFTERNOON
459-127521-0023 HAD HE BEEN ON DECK HE COULD NO LONGER SO MUCH AS HAVE PRETENDED NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION IT WAS AS PLAIN AS DAY
459-127521-0024 THE HONEST HANDS AND I WAS SOON TO SEE IT PROVED THAT THERE WERE SUCH ON BOARD MUST HAVE BEEN VERY STUPID FELLOWS OR RATHER I SUPPOSE THE TRUTH WAS THIS THAT ALL HANDS WERE DISAFFECTED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE RINGLEADERS ONLY SOME MORE SOME LESS
459-127521-0025 AND A FEW BEING GOOD FELLOWS IN THE MAIN COULD NEITHER BE LED NOR DRIVEN ANY FURTHER IT IS ONE THING TO BE IDLE AND SKULK AND QUITE ANOTHER TO TAKE A SHIP AND MURDER A NUMBER OF INNOCENT MEN AT LAST HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS MADE UP
459-127521-0026 SIX FELLOWS WERE TO STAY ON BOARD AND THE REMAINING THIRTEEN INCLUDING SILVER BEGAN TO EMBARK THEN IT WAS THAT THERE CAME INTO MY HEAD THE FIRST OF THE MAD NOTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO SAVE OUR LIVES
459-127521-0027 IF SIX MEN WERE LEFT BY SILVER IT WAS PLAIN OUR PARTY COULD NOT TAKE AND FIGHT THE SHIP AND SINCE ONLY SIX WERE LEFT IT WAS EQUALLY PLAIN THAT THE CABIN PARTY HAD NO PRESENT NEED OF MY ASSISTANCE IT OCCURRED TO ME AT ONCE TO GO ASHORE
459-127521-0028 IN A JIFFY I HAD SLIPPED OVER THE SIDE AND CURLED UP IN THE FORE SHEETS OF THE NEAREST BOAT AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE SHOVED OFF NO ONE TOOK NOTICE OF ME ONLY THE BOW OAR SAYING IS THAT YOU JIM KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN
459-127521-0029 BUT SILVER FROM THE OTHER BOAT LOOKED SHARPLY OVER AND CALLED OUT TO KNOW IF THAT WERE ME AND FROM THAT MOMENT I BEGAN TO REGRET WHAT I HAD DONE THE CREWS RACED FOR THE BEACH BUT THE BOAT I WAS IN HAVING SOME START AND BEING AT ONCE THE LIGHTER AND THE BETTER MANNED
459-127521-0030 SHOT FAR AHEAD OF HER CONSORT AND THE BOW HAD STRUCK AMONG THE SHORE SIDE TREES AND I HAD CAUGHT A BRANCH AND SWUNG MYSELF OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE NEAREST THICKET WHILE SILVER AND THE REST WERE STILL A HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND
459-127521-0031 BUT YOU MAY SUPPOSE I PAID NO HEED
