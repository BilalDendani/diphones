6804-79288-0000 ADDRESSED TO J S K MY DEAR K
6804-79288-0001 IF ANYTHING DECISIVE HAPPENED BUT AN IMPENETRABLE MYSTERY HUNG OVER THE AFFAIR TILL LATELY IT IS AT LAST BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT IN THE WORLD DISSIPATED AND I KEEP MY PROMISE BOTH FOR YOUR SATISFACTION
6804-79288-0002 AND FOR THE EASE OF MY OWN MIND YOU REMEMBER THE MORNING WHEN I SAID
6804-79288-0003 AND WHEN FROM DUMBARTON BRIDGE ITS GIANT SHADOW CLAD IN AIR AND SUNSHINE APPEARED IN VIEW WE HAD A PLEASANT DAY'S WALK WE PASSED SMOLLETT'S MONUMENT ON THE ROAD
6804-79288-0004 TALKED OF OLD TIMES YOU REPEATED LOGAN'S BEAUTIFUL VERSES TO THE CUCKOO
6804-79288-0005 WHERE THERE HAS BEEN NO RETURN AND WE BOTH AGREED I THINK
6804-79288-0006 OF IT A COMPANION FOR LIFE WAS THE LEAST EVIL OF THE TWO AS THERE WAS A SECRET SWEETNESS THAT TOOK OFF THE BITTERNESS AND THE STING OF REGRET AND
6804-79288-0007 IT LEFT BEHIND IT NOT CHERISHED SIGHS BUT STIFLED PANGS THE GALLING SENSE OF IT DID NOT BRING MOISTURE INTO THE EYES
6804-79288-0008 HARD LEVEL ROCKY WITH LOW STONE BRIDGES CONSTANTLY FLUNG ACROSS IT AND FRINGED WITH BIRCH TREES JUST THEN BUDDING INTO SPRING BEHIND WHICH AS THROUGH A SLIGHT VEIL
6804-79288-0009 YOU SAW THE HUGE SHADOWY FORM OF BEN LOMOND IT LIFTS ITS ENORMOUS BUT GRACEFUL BULK DIRECT FROM THE EDGE OF THE WATER WITHOUT ANY PROJECTING LOWLANDS AND HAS IN THIS RESPECT
6804-79288-0010 MUCH THE ADVANTAGE OF SKIDDAW LOCH LOMOND COMES UPON YOU BY DEGREES AS YOU ADVANCE UNFOLDING AND THEN WITHDRAWING ITS CONSCIOUS BEAUTIES LIKE AN ACCOMPLISHED COQUET YOU ARE STRUCK
6804-79288-0011 WITH THE POINT OF A ROCK THE ARCH OF A BRIDGE THE HIGHLAND HUTS LIKE THE FIRST RUDE HABITATIONS OF MEN DUG OUT OF THE SOIL BUILT OF TURF AND COVERED WITH BROWN HEATHER A SHEEP COTE
6804-79288-0012 OR YOUR EYE IS CAUGHT BY NOTHING BUT WATER EARTH AND SKY BEN LOMOND WAVES TO THE RIGHT
6804-79288-0013 CLOUD CAPT OR BARE AND DESCENDING TO A POINT AT THE HEAD OF THE LAKE SHEWS THE TROSSACS BEYOND TUMBLING ABOUT THEIR BLUE RIDGES LIKE WOODS WAVING TO THE LEFT IS THE COBLER
6804-79288-0014 WHOSE TOP IS LIKE A CASTLE SHATTERED IN PIECES AND NODDING TO ITS RUIN AND AT YOUR SIDE RISE THE SHAPES OF ROUND PASTORAL HILLS GREEN FLEECED WITH HERDS
6804-79288-0015 AND RETIRING INTO MOUNTAINOUS BAYS AND UPLAND VALLEYS WHERE SOLITUDE AND PEACE MIGHT MAKE THEIR LASTING HOME IF PEACE WERE TO BE FOUND IN SOLITUDE THAT IT WAS NOT ALWAYS SO
6804-79288-0016 FOR THERE WAS ONE IMAGE THAT ALONE HAUNTED ME IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS SUBLIMITY AND BEAUTY
6804-79288-0017 THE SNOW ON THE MOUNTAIN WOULD NOT LET US ASCEND AND BEING WEARY OF WAITING
6804-79288-0018 AS THE VESSEL SAILED UP THE THAMES THE AIR THICKENED WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING NEAR HER AND I HEAVED HER NAME PANTINGLY FORTH AS I APPROACHED THE HOUSE I COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF THE LINES
6804-79288-0019 THAT EARTH EXCEEDS NOT NOT ANOTHER LIKE IT THE TREASURES OF THE DEEP ARE NOT SO PRECIOUS AS ARE THE CONCEAL'D COMFORTS OF A MAN LOCK'D UP IN WOMAN'S LOVE I SCENT THE AIR OF BLESSINGS
6804-79288-0020 WHEN I COME BUT NEAR THE HOUSE WHAT A DELICIOUS BREATH TRUE LOVE SENDS FORTH THE VIOLET BEDS NOT SWEETER NOW FOR A WELCOME ABLE TO DRAW MEN'S ENVIES UPON MAN
6804-79288-0021 AND WHEN AT LENGTH SHE WAS PERSUADED BY MY REPEATED REMONSTRANCES TO COME AND TAKE MY HAND AND I OFFERED TO TOUCH HER LIPS SHE TURNED HER HEAD AND SHRUNK FROM MY EMBRACES AS IF QUITE ALIENATED OR MORTALLY OFFENDED
6804-79288-0022 I ASKED WHAT IT COULD MEAN WHAT HAD I DONE IN HER ABSENCE TO HAVE INCURRED HER DISPLEASURE WHY HAD SHE NOT WRITTEN TO ME I COULD GET ONLY SHORT SULLEN DISCONNECTED ANSWERS
6804-79288-0023 AS IF THERE WAS SOMETHING LABOURING IN HER MIND WHICH SHE EITHER COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT IMPART
6804-79288-0024 AND SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE MY SENTIMENTS TOWARDS HER MERITED BUT I THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE IT MIGHT BE PRUDERY AS I HAD RETURNED WITHOUT HAVING ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED WHAT I WENT ABOUT
6804-79288-0025 OR THAT SHE HAD TAKEN OFFENCE AT SOMETHING IN MY LETTERS SHE SAW HOW MUCH I WAS HURT I ASKED HER IF SHE WAS ALTERED SINCE I WENT AWAY NO
6804-79288-0026 IF THERE WAS ANY ONE ELSE WHO HAD BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO GAIN HER FAVOURABLE OPINION NO THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE WHAT WAS IT THEN WAS IT ANY THING IN MY LETTERS OR HAD I DISPLEASED HER
6804-79288-0027 NO NOT AT ALL BUT SHE DID NOT APPREHEND MY LAST LETTER REQUIRED ANY ANSWER
6804-79288-0028 BUT I COULD GET NO MORE FROM HER AND WAS OBLIGED TO LET HER GO WITH A HEAVY FOREBODING HEART I HOWEVER FOUND THAT C WAS GONE AND NO ONE ELSE HAD BEEN THERE OF WHOM I HAD CAUSE TO BE JEALOUS
6804-79288-0029 SHOULD I SEE HER ON THE MORROW SHE BELIEVED SO BUT SHE COULD NOT PROMISE THE NEXT MORNING SHE DID NOT APPEAR WITH THE BREAKFAST AS USUAL AT THIS I GREW SOMEWHAT UNEASY
6804-79288-0030 THE LITTLE BUONAPARTE HOWEVER WAS PLACED IN ITS OLD POSITION ON THE MANTELPIECE
6804-79288-0031 I SAW HER ONCE OR TWICE CASUALLY NOTHING PARTICULAR HAPPENED TILL THE NEXT DAY WHICH WAS SUNDAY I TOOK OCCASION TO GO INTO THE PARLOUR FOR THE NEWSPAPER WHICH SHE GAVE ME WITH A GRACIOUS SMILE AND SEEMED
6804-79288-0032 TOLERABLY FRANK AND CORDIAL THIS OF COURSE ACTED AS A SPELL UPON ME I WALKED OUT
6804-79288-0033 BUT I FOUND THAT I STILL CONTRIVED TO BEND MY STEPS TOWARDS HER AND I WENT BACK TO TAKE TEA AT HOME WHILE WE WERE OUT I TALKED TO WILLIAM ABOUT SARAH SAYING THAT SHE TOO WAS UNHAPPY
6804-79288-0034 AND ASKING HIM TO MAKE IT UP WITH HER HE SAID IF SHE WAS UNHAPPY HE WOULD NOT BEAR HER MALICE ANY MORE
6804-79288-0035 WILLIAM HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU I BELIEVE HE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS ON WHICH HE SAID IN HIS ABRUPT HEARTY MANNER SARAH I'M SORRY IF I'VE EVER SAID ANYTHING TO VEX YOU SO THEY SHOOK HANDS
6804-79288-0036 AND SHE SAID SMILING AFFABLY THEN I'LL THINK NO MORE OF IT I ADDED I SEE YOU'VE BROUGHT ME BACK MY LITTLE BUONAPARTE
6804-79288-0037 BUT YOU CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE EXQUISITE UNSTUDIED IRRESISTIBLE GRACES WITH WHICH SHE ACCOMPANIES THEM UNLESS YOU CAN SUPPOSE A GREEK STATUE TO SMILE MOVE AND SPEAK THOSE LINES IN TIBULLUS
6804-79288-0038 SEEM TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON PURPOSE FOR HER QUICQUID AGIT QUOQUO VESTIGIL VERTIT COMPONIT FURTIM
6804-79288-0039 DECOR OR WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE IN A MODERN PLAY WHICH MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN COMPOSED WITH AN EYE TO THIS LITTLE TRIFLER SEE WITH WHAT A WAVING AIR SHE GOES ALONG THE CORRIDOR HOW LIKE A FAWN
6804-79288-0040 YET STATELIER NO SOUND HOWEVER SOFT NOR GENTLEST ECHO TELLETH WHEN SHE TREADS BUT EVERY MOTION OF HER SHAPE DOTH SEEM HALLOWED BY SILENCE SO
6804-79288-0041 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE ALTERATION IN HER MANNER AND SAID REFERRING TO THE BUST YOU KNOW IT IS NOT MINE BUT YOURS I GAVE IT YOU NAY I HAVE GIVEN YOU ALL MY HEART
6804-79288-0042 AND WHATEVER I POSSESS IS YOURS SHE SEEMED GOOD HUMOUREDLY TO DECLINE THIS CARTE BLANCHE OFFER AND WAVED LIKE A THING OF ENCHANTMENT OUT OF THE ROOM FALSE CALM DECEITFUL SMILES
6804-79288-0043 NOT ONE FIVE MINUTES CONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF OLD ACQUAINTANCE WELL THEN FOR THE SAKE OF THE LITTLE IMAGE
6804-79288-0044 THE CHARM WAS BROKEN SHE REMAINED IMMOVEABLE WELL THEN I MUST COME TO YOU IF YOU WILL NOT RUN AWAY I WENT AND SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR
6804-79288-0045 HOW DIFFERENT IS THIS MEETING FROM THAT DELICIOUS PARTING WHEN YOU SEEMED NEVER WEARY OF REPEATING THE PROOFS OF YOUR REGARD AND TENDERNESS AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY WE TORE OURSELVES ASUNDER AT LAST
6804-79288-0046 I AM TEN THOUSAND TIMES FONDER OF YOU THAN I WAS THEN AND TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE UNHAPPY YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BE SO MY FEELINGS TOWARDS YOU ARE THE SAME AS THEY EVER WERE
6804-79288-0047 I TOLD HER SHE WAS MY ALL OF HOPE OR COMFORT MY PASSION FOR HER GREW STRONGER EVERY TIME I SAW HER SHE ANSWERED SHE WAS SORRY FOR IT
6804-79288-0048 I SAID SOMETHING ABOUT LOOKING ILL SHE SAID IN HER PRETTY MINCING EMPHATIC WAY I DESPISE LOOKS
6804-79288-0049 IT MUST BE SOME STRANGE AIR SHE GIVES HERSELF IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPROACHING CHANGE IN MY CIRCUMSTANCES SHE HAS BEEN PROBABLY ADVISED NOT TO GIVE UP TILL ALL IS FAIRLY OVER AND THEN SHE WILL BE MY OWN SWEET GIRL AGAIN
6804-79288-0050 ALL THIS TIME SHE WAS STANDING JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR MY HAND IN HERS WOULD THAT THEY COULD HAVE GROWN TOGETHER SHE WAS DRESSED IN A LOOSE MORNING GOWN HER HAIR CURLED BEAUTIFULLY
6804-79288-0051 SHE STOOD WITH HER PROFILE TO ME AND LOOKED DOWN THE WHOLE TIME NO EXPRESSION WAS EVER MORE SOFT OR PERFECT HER WHOLE ATTITUDE HER WHOLE FORM WAS DIGNITY AND BEWITCHING GRACE
6804-79288-0052 I SAID TO HER YOU LOOK LIKE A QUEEN MY LOVE ADORNED WITH YOUR OWN GRACES I GREW IDOLATROUS AND WOULD HAVE KNEELED TO HER SHE MADE A MOVEMENT AS IF SHE WAS DISPLEASED I TRIED TO DRAW HER TOWARDS ME
6804-79288-0053 AND OFFERED TO KISS HER AT PARTING I FOUND SHE OBSTINATELY REFUSED THIS STUNG ME TO THE QUICK IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE SHE HAD EVER DONE SO
6804-79288-0054 THERE MUST BE SOME NEW BAR BETWEEN US TO PRODUCE THESE CONTINUED DENIALS
6804-79288-0055 I FOLLOWED HER HALF WAY DOWN STAIRS BUT TO NO PURPOSE AND RETURNED INTO MY ROOM CONFIRMED IN MY MOST DREADFUL SURMISES
6804-79288-0056 I GAVE WAY TO ALL THE FURY OF DISAPPOINTED HOPE AND JEALOUS PASSION I WAS MADE THE DUPE OF TRICK AND CUNNING KILLED WITH COLD SULLEN SCORN
6804-79288-0057 USED TO WEAR CONTINUALLY IN MY BOSOM AS THE PRECIOUS TOKEN OF HER DEAR REGARD FROM MY NECK
6804-79288-0058 AS ONE OF HER INSTRUMENTS OF MOCKERY
6804-79288-0059 I COULD NOT LEAVE IT MY RAGE MY DESPAIR WERE UNCONTROLLABLE I SHRIEKED CURSES ON HER NAME AND ON HER FALSE LOVE AND THE SCREAM I UTTERED
6804-79288-0060 SO PITIFUL AND SO PIERCING WAS IT THAT THE SOUND OF IT TERRIFIED ME INSTANTLY BROUGHT THE WHOLE HOUSE FATHER MOTHER LODGERS AND ALL INTO THE ROOM THEY THOUGHT I WAS DESTROYING HER AND MYSELF
6804-79288-0061 I HAD GONE INTO THE BEDROOM MERELY TO HIDE AWAY FROM MYSELF AND AS I CAME OUT OF IT RAGING MAD WITH THE NEW SENSE OF PRESENT SHAME AND LASTING MISERY MISSUS F SAID SHE'S IN THERE
6804-79288-0062 THINKING THE CRIES HAD PROCEEDED FROM HER AND THAT I HAD BEEN OFFERING HER VIOLENCE OH NO I SAID SHE'S IN NO DANGER FROM ME I AM NOT THE PERSON AND TRIED TO BURST FROM THIS SCENE OF DEGRADATION
6804-79288-0063 THE MOTHER ENDEAVOURED TO STOP ME AND SAID FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T GO OUT MISTER FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T HER FATHER WHO WAS NOT I BELIEVE IN THE SECRET AND WAS THEREFORE JUSTLY SCANDALISED AT SUCH OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT SAID ANGRILY
6804-79288-0064 SHE HAS DESTROYED ME FOR EVER SHE HAS DOOMED MY SOUL TO PERDITION I RUSHED OUT OF THE HOUSE THINKING TO QUIT IT FOREVER BUT I WAS NO SOONER IN THE STREET THAN THE DESOLATION AND THE DARKNESS BECAME GREATER MORE INTOLERABLE
6804-79288-0065 AND THE EDDYING VIOLENCE OF MY PASSION DROVE ME BACK TO THE SOURCE FROM WHENCE IT SPRUNG THIS UNEXPECTED EXPLOSION
6804-79288-0066 IT WOULD GIVE RISE COULD NOT BE VERY AGREEABLE TO THE PRECIEUSE OR HER FAMILY AND WHEN I WENT BACK THE FATHER WAS WAITING AT THE DOOR AS IF ANTICIPATING THIS SUDDEN TURN OF MY FEELINGS WITH NO FRIENDLY ASPECT I SAID
6804-79288-0067 I HAVE TO BEG PARDON SIR BUT MY MAD FIT IS OVER AND I WISH TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO YOU IN PRIVATE HE SEEMED TO HESITATE BUT SOME UNEASY FOREBODINGS ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT
6804-79288-0068 PROBABLY PREVAILED OVER HIS RESENTMENT OR PERHAPS
6804-79288-0069 AND TO ASK FOR YOUR ADVICE AND INTERCESSION HE APPEARED SATISFIED AND I WENT ON I HAD NO CHANCE EITHER OF EXCULPATING MYSELF OR OF PROBING THE QUESTION TO THE BOTTOM
6804-79288-0070 BUT BY STATING THE NAKED TRUTH AND THEREFORE I SAID AT ONCE SARAH TOLD ME SIR
6804-79288-0071 AND LOOKING A THOUSAND TENDER REPROACHES FOR THE LOSS OF THAT GOOD OPINION WHICH SHE HELD DEARER THAN ALL THE WORLD SHE TOLD ME SIR THAT AS YOU ONE DAY PASSED THE DOOR WHICH STOOD A JAR YOU SAW HER IN AN ATTITUDE WHICH A GOOD DEAL STARTLED YOU
6804-79288-0072 I MEAN SITTING IN MY LAP WITH HER ARMS ROUND MY NECK AND MINE TWINED ROUND HER IN THE FONDEST MANNER
6804-79288-0073 WELL THEN SIR I CAN ONLY SAY THAT AS YOU SAW HER SITTING THEN SO SHE HAD BEEN SITTING FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF ALMOST EVERY DAY OF HER LIFE BY THE HOUR TOGETHER AND YOU MAY JUDGE YOURSELF
6804-79288-0074 KNOWING WHAT A NICE MODEST LOOKING GIRL SHE IS
6804-79288-0075 AS I HAVE BEEN SINCE MY RETURN
6804-79288-0076 THE OLD MAN ANSWERED VERY SERIOUSLY AND AS I THINK SINCERELY WHAT YOU NOW TELL ME SIR MORTIFIES AND SHOCKS ME AS MUCH AS IT CAN DO YOURSELF I HAD NO IDEA SUCH A THING WAS POSSIBLE
6804-79288-0077 I WAS MUCH PAINED AT WHAT I SAW BUT I THOUGHT IT AN ACCIDENT AND THAT IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN IT WAS A CONSTANT HABIT IT HAS HAPPENED A HUNDRED TIMES SINCE AND A THOUSAND BEFORE
6804-79288-0078 I LIVED ON HER CARESSES AS MY DAILY FOOD NOR CAN I LIVE WITHOUT THEM SO I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY
6804-79288-0079 TO BE ANYTHING BUT MINE FOR LIFE NOTHING COULD WELL EXCEED HIS ASTONISHMENT AND APPARENT MORTIFICATION WHAT I HAD SAID HE OWNED
6804-79288-0080 HAD LEFT A WEIGHT UPON HIS MIND THAT HE SHOULD NOT EASILY GET RID OF I TOLD HIM FOR MYSELF
6804-79288-0081 I THOUGHT HOWEVER FOR HER OWN SAKE SHE OUGHT TO ALTER HER PRESENT BEHAVIOUR HER MARKED NEGLECT AND DISLIKE SO FAR FROM JUSTIFYING LEFT HER FORMER INTIMACIES WITHOUT EXCUSE FOR NOTHING
6804-79288-0082 COULD RECONCILE THEM TO PROPRIETY OR EVEN A PRETENCE TO COMMON DECENCY BUT EITHER LOVE OR FRIENDSHIP SO STRONG AND PURE THAT IT COULD PUT ON THE GUISE OF LOVE SHE WAS CERTAINLY A SINGULAR GIRL
6804-79288-0083 DID SHE THINK IT RIGHT AND BECOMING TO BE FREE WITH STRANGERS AND STRANGE TO OLD FRIENDS I FRANKLY DECLARED
6804-79288-0084 FOR ANY ONE WHO WAS NOT RENDERED CALLOUS TO SUCH FAMILIARITIES BY BESTOWING THEM INDISCRIMINATELY ON EVERY ONE TO GRANT THE EXTREME AND CONTINUED INDULGENCES SHE HAD DONE TO ME
6804-79288-0085 WITHOUT EITHER LIKING THE MAN AT FIRST OR COMING TO LIKE HIM IN THE END IN SPITE OF HERSELF WHEN MY ADDRESSES HAD NOTHING AND COULD HAVE NOTHING HONOURABLE IN THEM SHE GAVE THEM EVERY ENCOURAGEMENT
6804-79288-0086 WHEN I WISHED TO MAKE THEM HONOURABLE SHE TREATED THEM WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT THE TERMS WE HAD BEEN ALL ALONG ON WERE SUCH AS IF SHE HAD BEEN TO BE MY BRIDE NEXT DAY
6804-79288-0087 A WANT BOTH OF COMMON PROPRIETY AND I MIGHT SAY OF NATURAL FEELING YET WITH ALL HER FAULTS I LOVED HER AND EVER SHOULD BEYOND ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING I HAD DRANK
6804-79288-0088 IN THE POISON OF HER SWEETNESS TOO LONG EVER TO BE CURED OF IT AND THOUGH I MIGHT FIND IT TO BE POISON IN THE END IT WAS STILL IN MY VEINS
6804-79288-0089 AND MARRY HER TO MORROW IF SHE WOULD HAVE ME THAT WAS THE QUESTION WOULD SHE HAVE ME OR WOULD SHE NOT
6804-79288-0090 I ACQUIESCED AND ADDED THAT I HAD BROUGHT ALL THIS UPON MYSELF BY ACTING CONTRARY TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF MY FRIEND
6804-79288-0091 WHO HAD DESIRED ME TO TAKE NO NOTICE WHETHER SHE CAME NEAR ME OR KEPT AWAY WHETHER SHE SMILED OR FROWNED WAS KIND OR CONTEMPTUOUS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO WAIT PATIENTLY FOR A MONTH
6804-79288-0092 TILL YOU ARE YOUR OWN MAN AS YOU WILL BE IN ALL PROBABILITY
6804-79288-0093 THERE'S AN END OF THE MATTER MISTER L SAID WELL SIR AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FOLLOW A BETTER ADVICE
