4189-115685-0000 CHAPTER FIVE SETTING THE TRAP INSIDE OF FIFTEEN MINUTES WE WERE ON OUR WAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CAUTION WAS SACRIFICED FOR THE SAKE OF SPEED AND THE MEN LEAPED AWAY EITHER ACROSS THE FOREST TOP OR OVER OPEN SPACES OF GROUND
4189-115685-0001 BUT CONCENTRATION WAS FORBIDDEN THE BIG BOSS NAMED THE SPOT ON THE HILLSIDE AS THE RALLYING POINT WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE ON BEING SEEN SO LONG AS WE DON'T GROUP HE DECLARED AT LEAST UNTIL WITHIN FIVE MILES OF THE RALLYING SPOT
4189-115685-0002 FROM THEN ON I WANT EVERY MAN TO DISAPPEAR FROM SIGHT AND TO TRAVEL UNDER COVER AND KEEP YOUR ULTROPHONES OPEN AND TUNED ON TEN FOUR SEVEN SIX WILMA AND I HAD RECEIVED OUR BATTLE EQUIPMENT FROM THE GEAR BOSS
4189-115685-0003 WHICH MADE THE LOAD WEIGH BUT A FEW OUNCES AND A SHORT SWORD THIS GEAR WE STRAPPED OVER EACH OTHER'S SHOULDERS ON TOP OF OUR JUMPING BELTS IN ADDITION WE EACH RECEIVED AN ULTROPHONE
4189-115685-0004 ALL THIS STUFF WE CLEARED FROM THE SUSQUANNAS A FEW HOURS AGO
4189-115685-0005 BUT YOU TWO HAD BETTER BE MOVING HE'S BECKONING YOU NOW HART WAS ABOUT TO CALL US ON OUR PHONES WHEN WE LOOKED UP AS SOON AS WE DID SO HE LEAPED AWAY WAVING US TO FOLLOW CLOSELY HE WAS A POWERFUL MAN
4189-115685-0006 AND HE DARTED AHEAD IN LONG SWIFT LOW LEAPS UP THE BANKS OF THE STREAM WHICH FOLLOWED A FAIRLY STRAIGHT COURSE AT THIS POINT BY EXTENDING OURSELVES HOWEVER WILMA AND I WERE ABLE TO CATCH UP TO HIM AS WE GRADUALLY SYNCHRONIZED OUR LEAPS WITH HIS
4189-115685-0007 HE OUTLINED TO US BETWEEN THE GRUNTS THAT ACCOMPANIED EACH LEAP HIS PLAN OF ACTION WE HAVE TO START THE BIG BUSINESS UNH SOONER OR LATER HE SAID AND IF UNH
4189-115685-0008 ALTHOUGH THE COUNCIL OF BOSSES UNH HAD INTENDED WAITING A FEW YEARS UNTIL ENOUGH ROCKET SHIPS HAVE BEEN UNH BUILT BUT NO MATTER WHAT THE SACRIFICE UNH
4189-115685-0009 WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THEM GET US ON THE RUN UNH WE'LL SET A TRAP FOR THE YELLOW DEVILS IN THE UNH VALLEY
4189-115685-0010 WE CAN USE UNH THAT IDEA OF YOURS OF SHOOTING UP THE REPELLOR UNH BEAMS WANT YOU TO GIVE US A DEMONSTRATION WITH FURTHER ADMONITION TO FOLLOW HIM CLOSELY HE INCREASED HIS PACE AND WILMA AND I WERE TAXED TO OUR UTMOST TO KEEP UP WITH HIM
4189-115685-0011 IT WAS ONLY IN ASCENDING THE SLOPES THAT MY TOUGHER MUSCLES OVERBALANCED HIS GREATER SKILL
4189-115685-0012 AS I HAD FOR WILMA WE SLEPT IN GREATER COMFORT THAT NIGHT UNDER OUR INERTRON BLANKETS AND WERE OFF WITH THE DAWN LEAPING CAUTIOUSLY TO THE TOP OF THE RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE VALLEY WHICH WILMA AND I HAD LEFT THE BOSS SCANNED THE SKY WITH HIS ULTROSCOPE
4189-115685-0013 PATIENTLY TAKING SOME FIFTEEN MINUTES TO THE TASK AND THEN SWUNG HIS PHONE INTO USE CALLING THE ROLL AND GIVING THE MEN THEIR INSTRUCTIONS HIS FIRST ORDER WAS FOR US ALL TO SLIP OUR EAR AND CHEST DISCS INTO PERMANENT POSITION
4189-115685-0014 THAT ONE WAS CONTAINED ENTIRELY IN A SMALL POCKET CASE THESE WITH WHICH WE WERE NOW EQUIPPED CONSISTED OF A PAIR OF EAR DISCS EACH A SEPARATE AND SELF CONTAINED RECEIVING SET THEY SLIPPED INTO LITTLE POCKETS OVER OUR EARS IN THE FABRIC HELMETS WE WORE
4189-115685-0015 THE CHEST DISCS WERE LIKEWISE SELF CONTAINED SENDING SETS STRAPPED TO THE CHEST A FEW INCHES BELOW THE NECK AND ACTUATED BY THE VIBRATIONS FROM THE VOCAL CORDS THROUGH THE BODY TISSUES THE TOTAL RANGE OF THESE SETS WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILES
4189-115685-0016 RECEPTION WAS REMARKABLY CLEAR QUITE FREE FROM THE STATIC THAT SO MARKED THE TWENTIETH CENTURY RADIOS AND OF A STRENGTH IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE DISTANCE OF THE SPEAKER
4189-115685-0017 WHICH WERE INDULGED IN HOWEVER WITH GREAT RESTRAINT AND ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAINTAINING CONTACTS
4189-115685-0018 WERE THE REVERSE OF EACH OTHER IN EFFICIENCY THESE MODERN AMERICANS FOR INSTANCE KNEW LITTLE OF HAND TO HAND FIGHTING AND NOTHING NATURALLY OF TRENCH WARFARE OF BARRAGES THEY WERE QUITE IGNORANT ALTHOUGH THEY POSSESSED WEAPONS OF TERRIFIC POWER
4189-115685-0019 AND UNTIL MY RECENT FLASH OF INSPIRATION NO ONE AMONG THEM APPARENTLY HAD EVER THOUGHT OF THE SCHEME OF SHOOTING A ROCKET INTO A REPELLOR BEAM AND LETTING THE BEAM ITSELF HURL IT UPWARD INTO THE MOST VITAL PART OF THE HAN SHIP HART PATIENTLY PLACED HIS MEN
4189-115685-0020 FIRST GIVING HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CAMPMASTERS
4189-115685-0021 IN THE END THE HUNDRED MEN WERE RINGED ABOUT THE VALLEY ON THE HILLSIDES AND TOPS EACH IN A POSITION FROM WHICH HE HAD A GOOD VIEW OF THE WRECKAGE OF THE HAN SHIP BUT NOT A MAN HAD COME IN VIEW SO FAR AS I COULD SEE IN THE WHOLE PROCESS
4189-115685-0022 THE BOSS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IT WAS HIS IDEA THAT HE WILMA AND I SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE WRECK IF HAN SHIPS SHOULD APPEAR IN THE SKY WE WOULD LEAP FOR THE HILLSIDES I SUGGESTED TO HIM TO HAVE THE MEN SET UP THEIR LONG GUNS TRAINED ON AN IMAGINARY CIRCLE SURROUNDING THE WRECK
4189-115685-0023 SERVING AS A TARGET HIMSELF WHILE HE CALLED ON THE MEN INDIVIDUALLY TO AIM THEIR PIECES AND LOCK THEM IN POSITION
4189-115685-0024 OR UTTERLY DESTROYED BY THE SHIP'S DISINTEGRATOR RAYS WHICH APPARENTLY HAD CONTINUED TO OPERATE IN THE MIDST OF ITS WARPED REMAINS FOR SOME MOMENTS AFTER THE CRASH IT WAS UNPLEASANT WORK SEARCHING THE MANGLED BODIES OF THE CREW BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE
4189-115685-0025 THE HAN CLOTHING I OBSERVED WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE AMERICANS AND IN MANY RESPECTS MORE LIKE THE GARB TO WHICH I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED IN THE EARLIER PART OF MY LIFE IT WAS MADE OF SYNTHETIC FABRICS LIKE SILKS LOOSE AND COMFORTABLE TROUSERS OF KNEE LENGTH AND SLEEVELESS SHIRTS
4189-115685-0026 FOR THE HAN CITIES WERE ENTIRELY ENCLOSED WITH SPLENDID ARRANGEMENTS FOR VENTILATION AND HEATING THESE ARRANGEMENTS OF COURSE WERE EQUALLY ADEQUATE IN THEIR AIRSHIPS THE HANS INDEED HAD QUITE A DISTASTE FOR UNSHADED DAYLIGHT SINCE THEIR LIGHTING APPARATUS DIFFUSED A CONTROLLED AMOUNT OF VIOLET RAYS
4189-115685-0027 MAKING THE UNMODIFIED SUNLIGHT UNNECESSARY FOR HEALTH AND UNDESIRABLE FOR COMFORT SINCE THE HANS DID NOT HAVE THE SECRET OF INERTRON NONE OF THEM WORE ANTI GRAVITY BELTS
4189-115685-0028 FOR THEY LIVED LIVES OF DEGENERATIVE PHYSICAL INERTIA HAVING MACHINERY OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL LABOR AND CONVENIENT CONVEYANCES FOR ANY MOVEMENT OF MORE THAN A FEW STEPS
4189-115685-0029 EVEN FROM THE TWISTED WRECKAGE OF THIS SHIP I COULD SEE THAT SEATS CHAIRS AND COUCHES PLAYED AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART IN THEIR SCHEME OF EXISTENCE BUT NONE OF THE BODIES WERE OVERWEIGHT
4189-115685-0030 BUT MUSCULARLY MUCH UNDERDEVELOPED
4189-115685-0031 AND OF COURSE DIETETICS TO THE POINT WHERE MEN AND WOMEN AMONG THEM NOT UNCOMMONLY REACHED THE AGE OF A HUNDRED YEARS WITH ARTERIES AND GENERAL HEALTH IN SPLENDID CONDITION
4189-115685-0032 THE BOSS HAD HARDLY FINISHED HIS ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE RING BARRAGE WHEN ONE OF THE SCOUTS ON AN EMINENCE TO THE NORTH ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF SEVEN HAN SHIPS SPREAD OUT IN A GREAT SEMI CIRCLE HART LEAPED FOR THE HILLSIDE
4189-115685-0033 BUT WILMA AND I HAD RAISED THE FLAPS OF OUR HELMETS AND SWITCHED OFF OUR SPEAKERS FOR CONVERSATION BETWEEN OURSELVES AND BY THE TIME WE DISCOVERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE SHIPS WERE CLEARLY VISIBLE SO FAST WERE THEY APPROACHING JUMP WE HEARD THE BOSS ORDER DEERING TO THE NORTH ROGERS TO THE EAST
4189-115685-0034 BUT WILMA LOOKED AT ME MEANINGLY AND POINTED TO WHERE THE TWISTED PLATES OF THE SHIP PROJECTING FROM THE GROUND OFFERED A SHELTER TOO LATE BOSS SHE SAID THEY'D SEE US
4189-115685-0035 HART WARNED WE'LL RISK IT
4189-115685-0036 GOOD FOR YOU REPLIED THE BOSS TAKE COMMAND THEN ROGERS FOR THE PRESENT DO YOU ALL KNOW HIS VOICE BOYS
4189-115685-0037 WILMA HUNT FOR THAT RECORD I SAID KNOWING THAT BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF TALKING I COULD KEEP THE ENTIRE COMMAND CONTINUOUSLY INFORMED AS TO THE SITUATION ON THE HILLSIDES KEEP YOUR GUNS TRAINED ON THE CIRCLES AND STAND BY ON THE HILLTOPS HOW MANY OF YOU ARE THERE
4189-115685-0038 SPEAK IN ROTATION FROM BALD KNOB AROUND TO THE EAST NORTH WEST IN TURN THE MEN CALLED THEIR NAMES THERE WERE TWENTY OF THEM I ASSIGNED THEM BY NAME TO COVER THE VARIOUS HAN SHIPS NUMBERING THE LATTER FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
4189-115685-0039 TRAIN YOUR ROCKETS ON THEIR REPELLOR RAYS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY UP BETWEEN SHIPS AND GROUND AIM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ELEVATION
4189-115685-0040 SHOOT WHEN I TELL YOU NOT BEFORE DEERING HAS THE RECORD
4189-115685-0041 SINCE THEY'RE SETTLING WITHOUT OPENING UP DISINTEGRATORS ANY OPINIONS MY EAR DISCS REMAINED SILENT
4189-115685-0042 STAND BY AND KEEP ALERT RAPIDLY AND EASILY THE LARGEST OF THE HAN SHIPS SETTLED TO THE EARTH
