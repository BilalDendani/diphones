7354-87676-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON HIS STEPS AGAIN TURNED TOWARDS MISSUS NAIRNE'S HOUSE AND WHY HE ASSURED HIMSELF THAT IT WOULD BE KIND TO CICELY TO GO TO SEE BABA AGAIN
7354-87676-0001 AND TAKE THE LATEST TIDINGS OF THE CHILD BACK TO HER MOTHER HE ONLY KNEW THAT HE HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO SIT QUIETLY IN THAT FIRELIT ROOM AGAIN
7354-87676-0002 TO FEEL THE SENSE OF PEACE AND HOME LIKE TRANQUILLITY THAT SEEMED TO HOVER ABOUT IT HE ONLY FELT THAT IN SOME INEXPLICABLE FASHION BABA'S NEW NURSE
7354-87676-0003 RESTED HIM THAT HER SIMPLICITY AND SOME CHILD LIKE QUALITY IN HER
7354-87676-0004 WOMEN HAD PLAYED NO PART IN HIS LIFE UNTIL ONE WOMAN HAD PLAYED AN OVERMASTERING ONE AND ALL THAT HIS PASSIONATE ADORATION OF MARGARET STANFORTH HAD COST AND WAS COSTING HIM
7354-87676-0005 GAVE AN ADDED CHARM TO A NATURE DEVOID OF ALL SUBTLETY SIMPLE AND SERENE ACROSS THE STRETCH OF YEARS BETWEEN THEM HE REGARDED CHRISTINA AS LITTLE MORE THAN A CHILD
7354-87676-0006 WORLD WEARY SOUL CAN FIND MOST COMFORT AND AS MERNSIDE FOR THE SECOND TIME SAT IN THE OLD FASHIONED SITTING ROOM AND HAD TEA WITH CHRISTINA AND HER SMALL CHARGE
7354-87676-0007 HE FELT THAT IN SOME INDEFINABLE FASHION
7354-87676-0008 THAT CHAFED HIS SOUL SHE SHOWED NO TRACES OF HER EMBARRASSMENT OF THE PREVIOUS DAY NIGHT HAD BROUGHT ITS OWN COUNSELS
7354-87676-0009 AFTER ALL SHE REFLECTED PHILOSOPHICALLY
7354-87676-0010 ONLY SOMETHING SILLY AND IT IS ALL OVER NOW PROBABLY HE HAS FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE STUPID GIRL WHO WROTE HIM THAT LETTER AND ANYHOW HE DOESN'T THINK ABOUT ME AT ALL EXCEPTING
7354-87676-0011 AS BABA'S NURSE SO IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO MAKE A FUSS HAVING COME TO THIS DETERMINATION CHRISTINA WITH CHARACTERISTIC GOOD SENSE
7354-87676-0012 AND IF THE TWO SHOWED THEIR PLEASURE IN DIFFERENT WAYS IT WAS NONE THE LESS PATENT TO THEIR VISITOR THAT THE LITTLE NURSE WITH HER BIG GREEN EYES AND DUSKY CLOUD OF HAIR
7354-87676-0013 TOOK AS MUCH PLEASURE IN HIS COMING AS DID THE GOLDEN HAIRED BABY AND IT GAVE HIM AN ODD GLOW OF SATISFACTION TO SEE HER EYES BRIGHTEN AS HE TALKED
7354-87676-0014 RUPERT WHEN HE CHOSE COULD TALK WELL AND INTERESTINGLY HE HAD TRAVELLED OVER THE GREATER PART OF THE WORLD AND IN THE COURSE OF HIS TRAVELS HAD USED EYES AND EARS TO GOOD PURPOSE
7354-87676-0015 AND TO CHRISTINA THE LITTLE TRAVELLED TO CHRISTINA THE WHOLE SUM OF WHOSE EXISTENCE HAD BEEN DIVIDED BETWEEN
7354-87676-0016 AND STRANGE UNCOUTH PEOPLES WAS BREATHLESSLY INTERESTING AND ENTRANCING SITTING THERE IN THE FIRELIGHT BABA NESTLED CLOSELY IN HIS ARMS CHRISTINA SEATED OPPOSITE TO HIM
7354-87676-0017 HER CHIN PROPPED ON HER HANDS HER EAGER EYES FOLLOWING HIS EVERY WORD
7354-87676-0018 THAT SURPRISED HIMSELF
7354-87676-0019 THAT THE FLOW OF HIS ELOQUENCE SUDDENLY CEASED IT WAS THERE IN THAT GARDEN OF THE DESERT THAT HE HAD FIRST MET MARGARET THE GIRL'S GENTLY ASKED QUESTION
7354-87676-0020 FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON BROUGHT BACK TO HIM
7354-87676-0021 THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE WOMAN WHO EVER SINCE HAD DOMINATED HIS WHOLE EXISTENCE HAD FIRST COME INTO HIS LIFE OVERHEAD THE DEEP PURE DEPTHS OF THE BLUEST SKY HE HAD EVER SEEN
7354-87676-0022 AGAINST ITS BLUE STATELY PALMS THAT WAVED THEIR FAN LIKE LEAVES WITH THE SOFT RUSTLING SOUNDS THAT ONLY BELONG TO THE PALM TREES AND THERE IN THE SUNLIGHT
7354-87676-0023 HER WHITE GOWN FALLING ABOUT HER MARGARET HAD STOOD HER DARK EYES TURNED TOWARDS THE ALL SURROUNDING DESERT HOW OR WHY THEY HAD BEGUN TO SPEAK HE COULD NOT NOW RECALL
7354-87676-0024 BUT FROM THAT FIRST SPEECH OF FELLOW COUNTRYMEN IN A FAR OFF LAND THEY HAD PASSED INTO ACQUAINTANCESHIP AND FROM THAT BY EASY STAGES TO THE FRIENDSHIP WHICH HE HAD IMPLORED HER TO GIVE HIM
7354-87676-0025 WELL AT LEAST IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SERVE HER TO HELP HER TO EASE SOME OF THE BURDEN OF HER LIFE
7354-87676-0026 THAT BURDEN OF WHICH HE HIMSELF KNEW SO LITTLE AND TO HAVE SERVED HER WAS SOMETHING FOR WHICH TO BE THANKFUL IF ONLY THERE WAS THE BITTERNESS
7354-87676-0027 IN THIS STRANGE MYSTERIOUS FASHION LEAVING HIM IGNORANT OF HER WHEREABOUTS AND OF ALL THAT CONCERNED HER IF ONLY SHE HAD TRUSTED HIM MORE IF ONLY
7354-87676-0028 WITH A START HE ROUSED HIMSELF TO REALISE THAT CHRISTINA'S EYES WERE WATCHING HIM WITH A CERTAIN SHY WONDER AND REMEMBERING THAT HE HAD BROKEN OFF HIS CONVERSATION ALMOST IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE HE LOOKED AT HER
7354-87676-0029 WITH A SMILE OF APOLOGY DO PLEASE FORGIVE ME HE SAID YOUR MENTION OF BISKRA BROUGHT BACK SO MANY PICTURES OF THE PAST AND
7354-87676-0030 BABA LIKES PICTURES THE CHILD MURMURED DROWSILY PERHAPS BABA WOULD LIKE THE PICTURE I SAW HER COUSIN ANSWERED FEELING AN ODD COMPULSION TO SPEAK OF WHAT WAS IN HIS THOUGHTS
7354-87676-0031 A PICTURE OF PALM TREES AND A PRINCESS IN A WHITE GOWN WHO WALKED AMONGST THEM AND WAS THE PRINCESS LIKE CHRISTINA
7354-87676-0032 BABA ALL AT ONCE PULLED HERSELF INTO AN UPRIGHT POSITION ON HIS KNEE AND LOOKED EARNESTLY INTO HIS FACE TELL BABA IF THAT PRINCESS WAS LIKE MINE OWN PRETTY LADY
7354-87676-0033 THE EYES OF THE TWO ELDERS MET AND CHRISTINA LAUGHED CONFUSEDLY BABA SEES THE PEOPLE SHE LOVES THROUGH VERY ROSY SPECTACLES SHE SAID AND RUPERT SMILED
7354-87676-0034 WHILST BABA'S INSISTENT VOICE REPEATED TELL IF THE PRINCESS IN THE WHITE FROCK WAS LIKE CHRISTINA NO NO NOT AT ALL LIKE HER RUPERT BEGAN
7354-87676-0035 HIS EYES GLANCING AT THE BENT DARK HEAD OPPOSITE TO HIM AT THE CLEAR WHITENESS OF THE CHEEKS INTO WHICH THE COLOUR WAS FLUSHING SO BECOMINGLY AT THE DEEP GREEN OF HER EYES
7354-87676-0036 THE RED LINE OF HER LIPS NO THE PRINCESS WAS AT LEAST HE BROKE OFF SUDDENLY AND LOOKED MORE NARROWLY AT THE GIRL
7354-87676-0037 AND WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY HALLUCINATION
7354-87676-0038 BUT AT THAT MOMENT YOUR PRINCESS AND MINE LITTLE BABA HAD A QUEER FANTASTIC LIKENESS TO ONE ANOTHER CHRISTINA LOOKED UP AT HIM SHARPLY
7354-87676-0039 SURPRISE THE PREDOMINATING EXPRESSION ON HER FACE BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK
7354-87676-0040 JUST TELL BABA ZACKLY ZACKLY WHAT THE PRINCESS IN THE WHITE FROCK WAS LIKE
7354-87676-0041 AGAIN RUPERT FELT IMPELLED TO SPEAK
7354-87676-0042 WHICH IF HE HAD CONSIDERED THE MATTER WOULD GREATLY HAVE SURPRISED HIM SHE WAS TALL HE ANSWERED VERY TALL AND VERY STATELY
7354-87676-0043 AS STATELY AS ONE OF THE PALM TREES UNDER WHICH SHE STOOD AND HER FACE WAS WHITE LIKE HER GOWN ONLY IT WAS NOT WHITE AS SICK PEOPLE ARE WHITE BUT LIKE THE WHITENESS OF A ROSE
7354-87676-0044 VERY CLEAR AND PURE AND HER HAIR WAS BLACK BLACK AS A RAVEN'S WING HIS VOICE GREW DREAMY HE SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HIS LISTENERS AND MERELY TO BE THINKING ALOUD
7354-87676-0045 AND HER EYES WERE DEEP AND DARK FATHOMLESS WELLS OF COLOUR AND VERY SAD CHRISTINA DREW IN HER BREATH QUICKLY AND LEANT FORWARD AN EAGER LOOK ON HER FACE I
7354-87676-0046 THE MAN'S VOICE CONTINUED THEY HELD SO MUCH
7354-87676-0047 THE PRINCESS
