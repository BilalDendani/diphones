4078-76853-0000 AIRS FROM THE ORIENT COWPERWOOD GAINED HIS FIRST REAL IMPRESSION OF STEPHANIE AT THE GARRICK PLAYERS WHERE HE WENT WITH AILEEN ONCE TO WITNESS A PERFORMANCE OF ELEKTRA HE LIKED STEPHANIE PARTICULARLY IN THIS PART
4078-76853-0001 AND THOUGHT HER BEAUTIFUL ONE EVENING NOT LONG AFTERWARD HE NOTICED HER IN HIS OWN HOME LOOKING AT HIS JADES PARTICULARLY A ROW OF BRACELETS AND EAR RINGS HE LIKED THE RHYTHMIC OUTLINE OF HER BODY
4078-76853-0002 WHICH REMINDED HIM OF A LETTER S IN MOTION QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER HIM THAT SHE WAS A REMARKABLE GIRL VERY DESTINED PERHAPS TO SOME SIGNIFICANT FUTURE AT THE SAME TIME STEPHANIE WAS THINKING OF HIM
4078-76853-0003 STOPPING BESIDE HER I THINK THEY'RE WONDERFUL THOSE DARK GREENS AND THAT PALE FATTY WHITE I CAN SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY WOULD BE IN A CHINESE SETTING I HAVE ALWAYS WISHED WE COULD FIND A CHINESE OR JAPANESE PLAY
4078-76853-0004 TO PRODUCE SOMETIME YES WITH YOUR BLACK HAIR THOSE EAR RINGS WOULD LOOK WELL SAID COWPERWOOD HE HAD NEVER DEIGNED TO COMMENT ON A FEATURE OF HERS BEFORE SHE TURNED HER DARK BROWN BLACK EYES ON HIM
4078-76853-0005 VELVETY EYES WITH A KIND OF BLACK GLOW IN THEM AND NOW HE NOTICED HOW TRULY FINE THEY WERE AND HOW NICE WERE HER HANDS BROWN ALMOST AS A MALAY'S HE SAID NOTHING MORE BUT THE NEXT DAY
4078-76853-0006 AN UNLABELED BOX WAS DELIVERED TO STEPHANIE AT HER HOME CONTAINING A PAIR OF JADE EAR RINGS A BRACELET AND A BROOCH WITH CHINESE CHARACTERS INTAGLIATED STEPHANIE WAS BESIDE HERSELF WITH DELIGHT
4078-76853-0007 SHE GATHERED THEM UP IN HER HANDS AND KISSED THEM FASTENING THE EAR RINGS IN HER EARS AND ADJUSTING THE BRACELET AND RING DESPITE HER EXPERIENCE WITH HER FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HER STAGE ASSOCIATES AND HER PARAMOURS
4078-76853-0008 SHE WAS STILL A LITTLE UNSCHOOLED IN THE WORLD HER HEART WAS ESSENTIALLY POETIC AND INNOCENT NO ONE HAD EVER GIVEN HER MUCH OF ANYTHING NOT EVEN HER PARENTS HER ALLOWANCE THUS FAR IN LIFE
4078-76853-0009 HAD BEEN A PITIFUL SIX DOLLARS A WEEK OUTSIDE OF HER CLOTHING AS SHE SURVEYED THESE PRETTY THINGS IN THE PRIVACY OF HER ROOM SHE WONDERED ODDLY WHETHER COWPERWOOD WAS GROWING TO LIKE HER
4078-76853-0010 WOULD SUCH A STRONG HARD BUSINESS MAN BE INTERESTED IN HER
4078-76853-0011 WAS SHE A GREAT ACTRESS AS SOME SAID SHE WAS AND WOULD STRONG ABLE TYPES OF MEN LIKE COWPERWOOD TAKE TO HER EVENTUALLY SHE HAD HEARD OF RACHEL
4078-76853-0012 SHE TOOK THE PRECIOUS GIFTS AND LOCKED THEM IN A BLACK IRON BOX WHICH WAS SACRED TO HER TRINKETS AND HER SECRETS THE MERE ACCEPTANCE OF THESE THINGS IN SILENCE WAS SUFFICIENT INDICATION TO COWPERWOOD
4078-76853-0013 THAT SHE WAS OF A FRIENDLY TURN OF MIND HE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL ONE DAY
4078-76853-0014 FRANK ALGERNON COWPERWOOD PERSONAL IT WAS WRITTEN IN A SMALL NEAT CAREFUL HAND ALMOST PRINTED I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WONDERFUL PRESENT
4078-76853-0015 I DIDN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD GIVE THEM TO ME AND I KNOW YOU SENT THEM I SHALL KEEP THEM WITH PLEASURE AND WEAR THEM WITH DELIGHT IT WAS SO NICE OF YOU TO DO THIS STEPHANIE PLATOW
4078-76853-0016 COWPERWOOD STUDIED THE HANDWRITING THE PAPER THE PHRASEOLOGY FOR A GIRL OF ONLY A LITTLE OVER TWENTY THIS WAS WISE AND RESERVED AND TACTFUL SHE MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AT HIS RESIDENCE
4078-76853-0017 HE GAVE HER THE BENEFIT OF A WEEK'S TIME AND THEN FOUND HER IN HIS OWN HOME ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AILEEN HAD GONE CALLING AND STEPHANIE WAS PRETENDING TO AWAIT HER RETURN IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU THERE IN THAT WINDOW HE SAID
4078-76853-0018 YOU FIT YOUR BACKGROUND PERFECTLY DO I THE BLACK BROWN EYES BURNED SOULFULLY THE PANNELING BACK OF HER WAS OF DARK OAK BURNISHED BY THE RAYS OF AN AFTERNOON WINTER SUN
4078-76853-0019 HER FULL RICH SHORT BLACK HAIR WAS CAUGHT BY A CHILDISH BAND OF BLOOD RED RIBBON HOLDING IT LOW OVER HER TEMPLES AND EARS HER LITHE BODY SO HARMONIOUS IN ITS GRAVEN ROUNDNESS
4078-76853-0020 WAS CLAD IN AN APPLE GREEN BODICE AND A BLACK SKIRT WITH GUSSETS OF RED ABOUT THE HEM HER SMOOTH ARMS FROM THE ELBOWS DOWN WERE BARE ON ONE WRIST WAS THE JADE BRACELET HE HAD GIVEN HER HER STOCKINGS WERE APPLE GREEN SILK
4078-76853-0021 AND DESPITE THE CHILL OF THE DAY HER FEET WERE SHOD IN ENTICINGLY LOW SLIPPERS WITH BRASS BUCKLES COWPERWOOD RETIRED TO THE HALL TO HANG UP HIS OVERCOAT AND CAME BACK SMILING ISN'T MISSUS COWPERWOOD ABOUT
4078-76853-0022 THE BUTLER SAYS SHE'S OUT CALLING BUT I THOUGHT I'D WAIT A LITTLE WHILE ANYHOW SHE MAY COME BACK SHE TURNED UP A DARK SMILING FACE TO HIM WITH LANGUISHING INSCRUTABLE EYES
4078-76853-0023 AND HE RECOGNIZED THE ARTIST AT LAST FULL AND CLEAR I SEE YOU LIKE MY BRACELET DON'T YOU IT'S BEAUTIFUL SHE REPLIED LOOKING DOWN AND SURVEYING IT DREAMILY I DON'T ALWAYS WEAR IT I CARRY IT IN MY MUFF

4078-76853-0025 WHICH SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AND TOOK OUT THE EAR RINGS AND BROOCH COWPERWOOD GLOWED WITH A STRANGE FEELING OF APPROVAL AND ENTHUSIASM AT THIS MANIFESTATION OF REAL INTEREST HE LIKED JADE HIMSELF VERY MUCH BUT MORE THAN THAT
4078-76853-0026 THE FEELING THAT PROMPTED THIS EXPRESSION IN ANOTHER ROUGHLY SPEAKING IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT YOUTH AND HOPE IN WOMEN PARTICULARLY YOUTH WHEN COMBINED WITH BEAUTY AND AMBITION IN A GIRL TOUCHED HIM
4078-76853-0027 HE RESPONDED KEENLY TO HER IMPULSE TO DO OR BE SOMETHING IN THIS WORLD WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND HE LOOKED ON THE SMART EGOISTIC VANITY OF SO MANY WITH A KINDLY TOLERANT ALMOST PARENTAL EYE
4078-76853-0028 POOR LITTLE ORGANISMS GROWING ON THE TREE OF LIFE THEY WOULD BURN OUT AND FADE SOON ENOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE BALLAD OF THE ROSES OF YESTERYEAR BUT IF HE HAD IT WOULD HAVE APPEALED TO HIM
4078-76853-0029 HE DID NOT CARE TO RIFLE THEM WILLY NILLY BUT SHOULD THEIR TEMPERAMENTS OR TASTES INCLINE THEM IN HIS DIRECTION THEY WOULD NOT SUFFER VASTLY IN THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF HIM THE FACT WAS THE MAN
4078-76853-0030 WAS ESSENTIALLY GENEROUS WHERE WOMEN WERE CONCERNED HOW NICE OF YOU HE COMMENTED SMILING I LIKE THAT AND THEN SEEING A NOTE BOOK AND PENCIL BESIDE HER HE ASKED WHAT ARE YOU DOING JUST SKETCHING
