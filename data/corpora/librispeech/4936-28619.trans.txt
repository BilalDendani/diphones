4936-28619-0000 SQUINTY AND THE BOY DID YOU EVER HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER WHO RAN AWAY FROM HOME AND WAS VERY GLAD TO RUN BACK OR BE BROUGHT BACK AGAIN BY A POLICEMAN PERHAPS
4936-28619-0001 OF COURSE YOUR LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER MAY NOT HAVE INTENDED TO RUN AWAY
4936-28619-0002 AROUND THE CORNER TOWARD THE CANDY STORE AND COULD NOT FIND THEIR WAY BACK AGAIN BUT WHEN HE OR SHE DID GET HOME HOW GLAD YOU WERE TO SEE THEM WEREN'T YOU IT WAS JUST LIKE THAT AT THE PEN WHERE SQUINTY THE COMICAL PIG LIVED
4936-28619-0003 WHEN THE FARMER PICKED HIM UP AND DROPPED HIM DOWN AMONG HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE CLEAN STRAW WUFF WUFF SQUEALER AND CURLY TAIL AND THE OTHERS WERE SO GLAD TO SEE SQUINTY
4936-28619-0004 THAT THEY GRUNTED AND SQUEALED AND WALKED ALL OVER ONE ANOTHER TO BE THE FIRST TO GET CLOSE TO HIM
4936-28619-0005 WHERE DID YOU GO WHAT DID YOU DO
4936-28619-0006 DID HE BITE YOU VERY HARD THESE WERE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS SQUINTY'S BROTHERS AND SISTERS ASKED OF THE LITTLE RUNAWAY PIG
4936-28619-0007 THEY PRESSED CLOSE UP TO HIM RUBBING THEIR FUNNY WIGGLING RUBBER LIKE NOSES AGAINST HIM AND SNUGGLING UP AGAINST HIM FOR THEY LIKED SQUINTY VERY MUCH INDEED
4936-28619-0008 THEN AFTER THE YOUNG PIGS HAD HAD THEIR TURN MISTER PIG AND MISSUS PIG BEGAN ASKING QUESTIONS WHAT MADE YOU RUN AWAY ASKED SQUINTY'S PAPA OH I WANTED TO HAVE AN ADVENTURE SAID SQUINTY
4936-28619-0009 WELL DID YOU HAVE ONE ASKED HIS MAMMA OH YES LOTS OF THEM ANSWERED THE LITTLE PIG BUT I DIDN'T FIND VERY MUCH TO EAT SQUINTY WAS VERY HUNGRY NOW OH DEAR EXCLAIMED MISSUS PIG
4936-28619-0010 SQUINTY THOUGHT SO HIMSELF FOR THE SMELL OF THE SOUR MILK THAT HAD BEEN IN THE FEEDING TROUGH MADE HIM MORE HUNGRY THAN EVER SQUINTY WALKED OVER AND TRIED TO FIND A FEW DROPS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE WOODEN TROUGH THESE HE LICKED UP WITH HIS RED TONGUE
4936-28619-0011 BUT THERE WAS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH HA I GUESS THAT LITTLE PIG MUST BE HUNGRY SAID THE FARMER LOOKING DOWN IN THE PEN AFTER HE HAD PUT SOME MORE STONES AND A BOARD OVER THE HOLE WHERE SQUINTY HAD GOTTEN OUT I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO FEED HIM
4936-28619-0012 FOR THE OTHERS HAVE HAD THEIR SUPPER AND HOW GLAD SQUINTY WAS WHEN THE FARMER WENT OVER TO THE BARREL WHERE THE PIGS FEED WAS KEPT

4936-28619-0014 FOR SOMETIMES PIGS ARE SO HUNGRY THAT THEY DO THIS YOU KNOW BEING PIGS THEY KNOW NO BETTER SO SQUINTY HAD HIS SUPPER AFTER ALL THOUGH HE DID RUN AWAY
4936-28619-0015 PERHAPS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUNISHED BY BEING SENT TO BED WITHOUT HAVING HAD ANYTHING TO EAT BUT YOU SEE THE FARMER WANTED HIS PIGS TO BE FAT AND HEALTHY SO HE FED THEM WELL SQUINTY WAS VERY GLAD OF THAT NOW
4936-28619-0016 ALL OF YOU GO TO SLEEP SAID MISSUS PIG WHEN IT GREW DARKER AND DARKER IN THE PEN SO SHE MADE THEM ALL CUDDLE DOWN IN THE STRAW PULLING IT OVER THEM WITH HER NOSE AND PAWS LIKE A BLANKET TO KEEP THEM WARM
4936-28619-0017 FOR ONLY PART OF THE PEN HAD A ROOF OVER IT AND THOUGH IT WAS SUMMER STILL IT WAS COOL AT NIGHT BUT SQUINTY'S BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAD NO NOTION OF GOING TO SLEEP SO SOON THEY WANTED TO HEAR ALL ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM WHEN HE HAD RUN AWAY
4936-28619-0018 AND THEY WANTED HIM TO TELL THEM OF HIS ADVENTURES SO THEY GRUNTED AND WHISPERED AMONG THEMSELVES WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU SQUINTY ASKED WUFF WUFF OH I HAD A FINE SWIM IN A BROOK SAID SQUINTY
