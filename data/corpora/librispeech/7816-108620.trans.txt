7816-108620-0000 CHAPTER TEN SHORTLY AFTERWARD AN INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH I AM INDUCED TO LOOK UPON AS MORE INTENSELY PRODUCTIVE OF EMOTION AS FAR MORE REPLETE WITH THE EXTREMES
7816-108620-0001 FIRST OF DELIGHT AND THEN OF HORROR THAN EVEN ANY OF THE THOUSAND CHANCES WHICH AFTERWARD BEFELL ME IN NINE LONG YEARS CROWDED WITH EVENTS OF THE MOST STARTLING AND IN MANY CASES OF THE MOST UNCONCEIVED AND UNCONCEIVABLE CHARACTER
7816-108620-0002 WE WERE LYING ON THE DECK NEAR THE COMPANION WAY AND DEBATING THE POSSIBILITY OF YET MAKING OUR WAY INTO THE STOREROOM WHEN LOOKING TOWARD AUGUSTUS WHO LAY FRONTING MYSELF I PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD BECOME ALL AT ONCE DEADLY PALE
7816-108620-0003 AND THAT HIS LIPS WERE QUIVERING IN THE MOST SINGULAR AND UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER GREATLY ALARMED I SPOKE TO HIM BUT HE MADE ME NO REPLY AND I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK THAT HE WAS SUDDENLY TAKEN ILL
7816-108620-0004 WHEN I TOOK NOTICE OF HIS EYES WHICH WERE GLARING APPARENTLY AT SOME OBJECT BEHIND ME I TURNED MY HEAD AND SHALL NEVER FORGET THE ECSTATIC JOY WHICH THRILLED THROUGH EVERY PARTICLE OF MY FRAME WHEN I PERCEIVED A LARGE BRIG
7816-108620-0005 AND UNABLE TO ARTICULATE A SYLLABLE
7816-108620-0006 THE FORMER DANCED ABOUT THE DECK LIKE A MADMAN UTTERING THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT RHODOMONTADES INTERMINGLED WITH HOWLS AND IMPRECATIONS WHILE THE LATTER BURST INTO TEARS AND CONTINUED FOR MANY MINUTES WEEPING LIKE A CHILD
7816-108620-0007 THE VESSEL IN SIGHT WAS A LARGE HERMAPHRODITE BRIG OF A DUTCH BUILD AND PAINTED BLACK WITH A TAWDRY GILT FIGURE HEAD SHE HAD EVIDENTLY SEEN A GOOD DEAL OF ROUGH WEATHER AND WE SUPPOSED
7816-108620-0008 HAD SUFFERED MUCH IN THE GALE WHICH HAD PROVED SO DISASTROUS TO OURSELVES FOR HER FORETOPMAST WAS GONE AND SOME OF HER STARBOARD BULWARKS WHEN WE FIRST SAW HER SHE WAS AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID
7816-108620-0009 ABOUT TWO MILES OFF AND TO WINDWARD BEARING DOWN UPON US THE BREEZE WAS VERY GENTLE AND WHAT ASTONISHED US CHIEFLY WAS THAT SHE HAD NO OTHER SAILS SET THAN HER FOREMAST AND MAINSAIL WITH A FLYING JIB
7816-108620-0010 OF COURSE SHE CAME DOWN BUT SLOWLY AND OUR IMPATIENCE AMOUNTED NEARLY TO PHRENSY THE AWKWARD MANNER IN WHICH SHE STEERED TOO WAS REMARKED BY ALL OF US EVEN EXCITED AS WE WERE
7816-108620-0011 THAT ONCE OR TWICE WE THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE SHE COULD SEE US OR IMAGINED THAT HAVING SEEN US AND DISCOVERED NO PERSON ON BOARD SHE WAS ABOUT TO TACK AND MAKE OFF IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
7816-108620-0012 UPON EACH OF THESE OCCASIONS WE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF OUR VOICES WHEN THE STRANGER WOULD APPEAR TO CHANGE FOR A MOMENT HER INTENTION AND AGAIN HOLD ON TOWARD US THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT BEING REPEATED TWO OR THREE TIMES
7816-108620-0013 WE THEN SAW THREE SEAMEN WHOM BY THEIR DRESS WE TOOK TO BE HOLLANDERS TWO OF THESE WERE LYING ON SOME OLD SAILS NEAR THE FORECASTLE AND THE THIRD WHO APPEARED TO BE LOOKING AT US WITH GREAT CURIOSITY
7816-108620-0014 THIS LAST WAS A STOUT AND TALL MAN WITH A VERY DARK SKIN HE SEEMED BY HIS MANNER TO BE ENCOURAGING US TO HAVE PATIENCE NODDING TO US IN A CHEERFUL ALTHOUGH RATHER ODD WAY
7816-108620-0015 AND SMILING CONSTANTLY SO AS TO DISPLAY A SET OF THE MOST BRILLIANTLY WHITE TEETH AS HIS VESSEL DREW NEARER WE SAW A RED FLANNEL CAP WHICH HE HAD ON FALL FROM HIS HEAD INTO THE WATER
7816-108620-0016 BUT OF THIS HE TOOK LITTLE OR NO NOTICE CONTINUING HIS ODD SMILES AND GESTICULATIONS
7816-108620-0017 AND I RELATE THEM IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD PRECISELY AS THEY APPEARED TO US THE BRIG CAME ON SLOWLY AND NOW MORE STEADILY THAN BEFORE AND I CANNOT SPEAK CALMLY OF THIS EVENT
7816-108620-0018 OUR HEARTS LEAPED UP WILDLY WITHIN US AND WE POURED OUT OUR WHOLE SOULS IN SHOUTS AND THANKSGIVING TO GOD FOR THE COMPLETE UNEXPECTED AND GLORIOUS DELIVERANCE THAT WAS SO PALPABLY AT HAND OF A SUDDEN AND ALL AT ONCE
7816-108620-0019 THERE CAME WAFTED OVER THE OCEAN FROM THE STRANGE VESSEL WHICH WAS NOW CLOSE UPON US A SMELL A STENCH SUCH AS THE WHOLE WORLD HAS NO NAME FOR NO CONCEPTION OF HELLISH UTTERLY SUFFOCATING
7816-108620-0020 INSUFFERABLE INCONCEIVABLE I GASPED FOR BREATH AND TURNING TO MY COMPANIONS PERCEIVED THAT THEY WERE PALER THAN MARBLE BUT WE HAD NOW NO TIME LEFT FOR QUESTION OR SURMISE THE BRIG WAS WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF US
7816-108620-0021 AS SHE PASSED UNDER OUR STERN AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWENTY FEET WE HAD A FULL VIEW OF HER DECKS SHALL I EVER FORGET THE TRIPLE HORROR OF THAT SPECTACLE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY HUMAN BODIES AMONG WHOM WERE SEVERAL FEMALES
7816-108620-0022 LAY SCATTERED ABOUT BETWEEN THE COUNTER AND THE GALLEY IN THE LAST AND MOST LOATHSOME STATE OF PUTREFACTION WE PLAINLY SAW THAT NOT A SOUL LIVED IN THAT FATED VESSEL
7816-108620-0023 IN THE AGONY OF THE MOMENT THAT THOSE SILENT AND DISGUSTING IMAGES WOULD STAY FOR US WOULD NOT ABANDON US TO BECOME LIKE THEM WOULD RECEIVE US AMONG THEIR GOODLY COMPANY WE WERE RAVING WITH HORROR AND DESPAIR
7816-108620-0024 THOROUGHLY MAD THROUGH THE ANGUISH OF OUR GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT AS OUR FIRST LOUD YELL OF TERROR BROKE FORTH IT WAS REPLIED TO BY SOMETHING FROM NEAR THE BOWSPRIT OF THE STRANGER
7816-108620-0025 SO CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE SCREAM OF A HUMAN VOICE THAT THE NICEST EAR MIGHT HAVE BEEN STARTLED AND DECEIVED AT THIS INSTANT ANOTHER SUDDEN YAW BROUGHT THE REGION OF THE FORECASTLE FOR A MOMENT INTO VIEW
7816-108620-0026 AND WE BEHELD AT ONCE THE ORIGIN OF THE SOUND WE SAW THE TALL STOUT FIGURE STILL LEANING ON THE BULWARK AND STILL NODDING HIS HEAD TO AND FRO BUT HIS FACE WAS NOW TURNED FROM US SO THAT WE COULD NOT BEHOLD IT
7816-108620-0027 HIS ARMS WERE EXTENDED OVER THE RAIL AND THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS FELL OUTWARD HIS KNEES WERE LODGED UPON A STOUT ROPE
7816-108620-0028 ON HIS BACK FROM WHICH A PORTION OF THE SHIRT HAD BEEN TORN LEAVING IT BARE
7816-108620-0029 BUSILY GORGING ITSELF WITH THE HORRIBLE FLESH ITS BILL AND TALONS DEEP BURIED AND ITS WHITE PLUMAGE SPATTERED ALL OVER WITH BLOOD AS THE BRIG MOVED FARTHER ROUND SO AS TO BRING US CLOSE IN VIEW
7816-108620-0030 THE BIRD WITH MUCH APPARENT DIFFICULTY DREW OUT ITS CRIMSONED HEAD AND AFTER EYEING US FOR A MOMENT AS IF STUPEFIED
7816-108620-0031 AND FLYING DIRECTLY ABOVE OUR DECK HOVERED THERE A WHILE WITH A PORTION OF CLOTTED AND LIVER LIKE SUBSTANCE IN ITS BEAK THE HORRID MORSEL DROPPED AT LENGTH WITH A SULLEN SPLASH IMMEDIATELY AT THE FEET OF PARKER
7816-108620-0032 MAY GOD FORGIVE ME BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND A THOUGHT A THOUGHT WHICH I WILL NOT MENTION AND I FELT MYSELF MAKING A STEP TOWARD THE ENSANGUINED SPOT
7816-108620-0033 I LOOKED UPWARD AND THE EYES OF AUGUSTUS MET MY OWN WITH A DEGREE OF INTENSE AND EAGER MEANING WHICH IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT ME TO MY SENSES I SPRANG FORWARD QUICKLY
7816-108620-0034 AND WITH A DEEP SHUDDER THREW THE FRIGHTFUL THING INTO THE SEA THE BODY FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN TAKEN RESTING AS IT DID UPON THE ROPE HAD BEEN EASILY SWAYED TO AND FRO BY THE EXERTIONS OF THE CARNIVOROUS BIRD
7816-108620-0035 AND IT WAS THIS MOTION WHICH HAD AT FIRST IMPRESSED US WITH THE BELIEF OF ITS BEING ALIVE AS THE GULL RELIEVED IT OF ITS WEIGHT IT SWUNG ROUND AND FELL PARTIALLY OVER SO THAT THE FACE WAS FULLY DISCOVERED
7816-108620-0036 NEVER SURELY WAS ANY OBJECT SO TERRIBLY FULL OF AWE THE EYES WERE GONE AND THE WHOLE FLESH AROUND THE MOUTH LEAVING THE TEETH UTTERLY NAKED
7816-108620-0037 THIS THEN WAS THE SMILE WHICH HAD CHEERED US ON TO HOPE THIS THE BUT I FORBEAR THE BRIG AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD PASSED UNDER OUR STERN AND MADE ITS WAY SLOWLY BUT STEADILY TO LEEWARD
7816-108620-0038 WITH HER AND WITH HER TERRIBLE CREW WENT ALL OUR GAY VISIONS OF DELIVERANCE AND JOY DELIBERATELY AS SHE WENT BY WE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE FOUND MEANS OF BOARDING HER
7816-108620-0039 HAD NOT OUR SUDDEN DISAPPOINTMENT AND THE APPALLING NATURE OF THE DISCOVERY WHICH ACCOMPANIED IT LAID ENTIRELY PROSTRATE EVERY ACTIVE FACULTY OF MIND AND BODY WE HAD SEEN AND FELT
7816-108620-0040 HOW MUCH OUR INTELLECTS HAD BEEN WEAKENED BY THIS INCIDENT MAY BE ESTIMATED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN THE VESSEL HAD PROCEEDED SO FAR THAT WE COULD PERCEIVE NO MORE THAN THE HALF OF HER HULL
7816-108620-0041 THE PROPOSITION WAS SERIOUSLY ENTERTAINED OF ATTEMPTING TO OVERTAKE HER BY SWIMMING I HAVE SINCE THIS PERIOD VAINLY ENDEAVOURED TO OBTAIN SOME CLEW TO THE HIDEOUS UNCERTAINTY WHICH ENVELOPED THE FATE OF THE STRANGER
7816-108620-0042 HER BUILD AND GENERAL APPEARANCE AS I HAVE BEFORE STATED LED US TO THE BELIEF THAT SHE WAS A DUTCH TRADER AND THE DRESSES OF THE CREW ALSO SUSTAINED THIS OPINION WE MIGHT HAVE EASILY SEEN THE NAME UPON HER STERN
7816-108620-0043 AND INDEED TAKEN OTHER OBSERVATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE GUIDED US IN MAKING OUT HER CHARACTER BUT THE INTENSE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT BLINDED US TO EVERY THING OF THAT NATURE
7816-108620-0044 FROM THE SAFFRON LIKE HUE OF SUCH OF THE CORPSES AS WERE NOT ENTIRELY DECAYED WE CONCLUDED THAT THE WHOLE OF HER COMPANY HAD PERISHED BY THE YELLOW FEVER OR SOME OTHER VIRULENT DISEASE OF THE SAME FEARFUL KIND
7816-108620-0045 IF SUCH WERE THE CASE AND I KNOW NOT WHAT ELSE TO IMAGINE DEATH TO JUDGE FROM THE POSITIONS OF THE BODIES MUST HAVE COME UPON THEM IN A MANNER AWFULLY SUDDEN AND OVERWHELMING
7816-108620-0046 IN A WAY TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THAT WHICH GENERALLY CHARACTERIZES EVEN THE MOST DEADLY PESTILENCES WITH WHICH MANKIND ARE ACQUAINTED IT IS POSSIBLE INDEED THAT POISON ACCIDENTALLY INTRODUCED INTO SOME OF THEIR SEA STORES
7816-108620-0047 MAY HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT THE DISASTER OR THAT THE EATING OF SOME UNKNOWN VENOMOUS SPECIES OF FISH OR OTHER MARINE ANIMAL OR OCEANIC BIRD MIGHT HAVE INDUCED IT
