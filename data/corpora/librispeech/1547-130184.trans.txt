1547-130184-0000 BUT WHEN THE HELPFUL VOICE WAS SILENT THE DAILY LESSON OVER THE BELOVED PRESENCE GONE AND NOTHING REMAINED BUT LONELINESS AND GRIEF THEN JO FOUND HER PROMISE VERY HARD TO KEEP
1547-130184-0001 HOW COULD SHE COMFORT FATHER AND MOTHER WHEN HER OWN HEART ACHED WITH A CEASELESS LONGING FOR HER SISTER HOW COULD SHE MAKE THE HOUSE CHEERFUL WHEN ALL ITS LIGHT AND WARMTH AND BEAUTY
1547-130184-0002 AND WHERE IN ALL THE WORLD COULD SHE FIND SOME USEFUL HAPPY WORK TO DO THAT WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE LOVING SERVICE WHICH HAD BEEN ITS OWN REWARD SHE TRIED IN A BLIND HOPELESS WAY TO DO HER DUTY
1547-130184-0003 SECRETLY REBELLING AGAINST IT ALL THE WHILE
1547-130184-0004 AND LIFE GET HARDER AND HARDER AS SHE TOILED ALONG SOME PEOPLE SEEMED TO GET ALL SUNSHINE AND SOME ALL SHADOW IT WAS NOT FAIR FOR SHE TRIED MORE THAN AMY TO BE GOOD BUT NEVER GOT ANY REWARD
1547-130184-0005 ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT TROUBLE AND HARD WORK POOR JO THESE WERE DARK DAYS TO HER FOR SOMETHING LIKE DESPAIR CAME OVER HER WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF SPENDING ALL HER LIFE IN THAT QUIET HOUSE
1547-130184-0006 DEVOTED TO HUMDRUM CARES A FEW SMALL PLEASURES AND THE DUTY THAT NEVER SEEMED TO GROW ANY EASIER I CAN'T DO IT I WASN'T MEANT FOR A LIFE LIKE THIS AND I KNOW I SHALL
1547-130184-0007 SHE SAID TO HERSELF WHEN HER FIRST EFFORTS FAILED AND SHE FELL INTO THE MOODY MISERABLE STATE OF MIND WHICH OFTEN COMES WHEN STRONG WILLS HAVE TO YIELD TO THE INEVITABLE BUT SOMEONE DID COME AND HELP HER
1547-130184-0008 THOUGH JO DID NOT RECOGNIZE HER GOOD ANGELS AT ONCE BECAUSE THEY WORE FAMILIAR SHAPES AND USED THE SIMPLE SPELLS BEST FITTED TO POOR HUMANITY OFTEN SHE STARTED UP AT NIGHT THINKING BETH CALLED HER
1547-130184-0009 AND WHEN THE SIGHT OF THE LITTLE EMPTY BED MADE HER CRY WITH THE BITTER CRY OF UNSUBMISSIVE SORROW OH BETH COME BACK COME BACK SHE DID NOT STRETCH OUT HER YEARNING ARMS IN VAIN
1547-130184-0010 FOR AS QUICK TO HEAR HER SOBBING AS SHE HAD BEEN TO HEAR HER SISTER'S FAINTEST WHISPER HER MOTHER CAME TO COMFORT HER NOT WITH WORDS ONLY BUT THE PATIENT TENDERNESS THAT SOOTHES BY A TOUCH
1547-130184-0011 TEARS THAT WERE MUTE REMINDERS OF A GREATER GRIEF THAN JO'S AND BROKEN WHISPERS MORE ELOQUENT THAN PRAYERS BECAUSE HOPEFUL RESIGNATION WENT HAND IN HAND WITH NATURAL SORROW
1547-130184-0012 SACRED MOMENTS WHEN HEART TALKED TO HEART IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT TURNING AFFLICTION TO A BLESSING WHICH CHASTENED GRIEF AND STRENGTHNED LOVE FEELING THIS JO'S BURDEN SEEMED EASIER TO BEAR
1547-130184-0013 DUTY GREW SWEETER AND LIFE LOOKED MORE ENDURABLE SEEN FROM THE SAFE SHELTER OF HER MOTHER'S ARMS WHEN ACHING HEART WAS A LITTLE COMFORTED TROUBLED MIND LIKEWISE FOUND HELP FOR ONE DAY
1547-130184-0014 SHE WENT TO THE STUDY AND LEANING OVER THE GOOD GRAY HEAD LIFTED TO WELCOME HER WITH A TRANQUIL SMILE SHE SAID VERY HUMBLY FATHER TALK TO ME AS YOU DID TO BETH
1547-130184-0015 FOR I'M ALL WRONG MY DEAR NOTHING CAN COMFORT ME LIKE THIS HE ANSWERED WITH A FALTER IN HIS VOICE AND BOTH ARMS ROUND HER AS IF HE TOO NEEDED HELP AND DID NOT FEAR TO ASK FOR IT THEN
1547-130184-0016 SITTING IN BETH'S LITTLE CHAIR CLOSE BESIDE HIM JO TOLD HER TROUBLES
1547-130184-0017 THE FRUITLESS EFFORTS THAT DISCOURAGED HER THE WANT OF FAITH THAT MADE LIFE LOOK SO DARK AND ALL THE SAD BEWILDERMENT
1547-130184-0018 SHE GAVE HIM ENTIRE CONFIDENCE HE GAVE HER THE HELP SHE NEEDED AND BOTH FOUND CONSOLATION IN THE ACT FOR THE TIME HAD COME WHEN THEY COULD TALK TOGETHER NOT ONLY AS FATHER AND DAUGHTER
1547-130184-0019 BUT AS MAN AND WOMAN ABLE AND GLAD TO SERVE EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL SYMPATHY AS WELL AS MUTUAL LOVE HAPPY THOUGHTFUL TIMES THERE IN THE OLD STUDY WHICH JO CALLED THE CHURCH OF ONE MEMBER
1547-130184-0020 AND FROM WHICH SHE CAME WITH FRESH COURAGE RECOVERED CHEERFULNESS AND A MORE SUBMISSIVE SPIRIT FOR THE PARENTS WHO HAD TAUGHT ONE CHILD TO MEET DEATH WITHOUT FEAR WERE TRYING NOW TO TEACH ANOTHER TO ACCEPT LIFE WITHOUT DESPONDENCY OR DISTRUST
1547-130184-0021 AND TO USE ITS BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITIES WITH GRATITUDE AND POWER OTHER HELPS HAD JO HUMBLE WHOLESOME DUTIES AND DELIGHTS THAT WOULD NOT BE DENIED THEIR PART IN SERVING HER
1547-130184-0022 BROOMS AND DISHCLOTHS NEVER COULD BE AS DISTASTEFUL AS THEY ONCE HAD BEEN FOR BETH HAD PRESIDED OVER BOTH AND SOMETHING OF HER HOUSEWIFELY SPIRIT SEEMED TO LINGER AROUND THE LITTLE MOP AND THE OLD BRUSH
1547-130184-0023 NEVER THROWN AWAY AS SHE USED THEM JO FOUND HERSELF HUMMING THE SONGS BETH USED TO HUM IMITATING BETH'S ORDERLY WAYS AND GIVING THE LITTLE TOUCHES HERE AND THERE THAT KEPT EVERYTHING FRESH AND COZY
1547-130184-0024 WHICH WAS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD MAKING HOME HAPPY THOUGH SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT TILL HANNAH SAID WITH AN APPROVING SQUEEZE OF THE HAND YOU THOUGHTFUL CREETER YOU'RE DETERMINED WE SHAN'T MISS THAT DEAR LAMB EF YOU CAN HELP IT
1547-130184-0025 WE DON'T SAY MUCH BUT WE SEE IT
1547-130184-0026 AS THEY SAT SEWING TOGETHER JO DISCOVERED HOW MUCH IMPROVED HER SISTER MEG WAS HOW WELL SHE COULD TALK HOW MUCH SHE KNEW ABOUT GOOD WOMANLY IMPULSES THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS HOW HAPPY SHE WAS IN HUSBAND AND CHILDREN
1547-130184-0027 AND HOW MUCH THEY WERE ALL DOING FOR EACH OTHER MARRIAGE IS AN EXCELLENT THING AFTER ALL I WONDER IF I SHOULD BLOSSOM OUT HALF AS WELL AS YOU HAVE IF I TRIED IT
1547-130184-0028 I COULD SAID JO AS SHE CONSTRUCTED A KITE FOR DEMI IN THE TOPSY TURVY NURSERY IT'S JUST WHAT YOU NEED TO BRING OUT THE TENDER WOMANLY HALF OF YOUR NATURE JO YOU ARE LIKE A CHESTNUT BURR PRICKLY OUTSIDE
1547-130184-0029 BUT SILKY SOFT WITHIN AND A SWEET KERNAL IF ONE CAN ONLY GET AT IT LOVE WILL MAKE YOU SHOW YOUR HEART ONE DAY AND THEN THE ROUGH BURR WILL FALL OFF FROST OPENS CHESTNUT BURRS MA'AM
1547-130184-0030 AND IT TAKES A GOOD SHAKE TO BRING THEM DOWN BOYS GO NUTTING AND I DON'T CARE TO BE BAGGED BY THEM RETURNED JO PASTING AWAY AT THE KITE WHICH NO WIND THAT BLOWS WOULD EVER CARRY UP FOR DAISY HAD TIED HERSELF ON AS A BOB
1547-130184-0031 MEG LAUGHED FOR SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE A GLIMMER OF JO'S OLD SPIRIT BUT SHE FELT IT HER DUTY TO ENFORCE HER OPINION BY EVERY ARGUMENT IN HER POWER
1547-130184-0032 ESPECIALLY AS TWO OF MEG'S MOST EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE
1547-130184-0033 GRIEF IS THE BEST OPENER OF SOME HEARTS AND JO'S WAS NEARLY READY FOR THE BAG A LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE TO RIPEN THE NUT THEN NOT A BOY'S IMPATIENT SHAKE BUT A MAN'S HAND
1547-130184-0034 REACHED UP TO PICK IT GENTLY FROM THE BURR AND FIND THE KERNAL SOUND AND SWEET IF SHE SUSPECTED THIS SHE WOULD HAVE SHUT UP TIGHT AND BEEN MORE PRICKLY THAN EVER
1547-130184-0035 FORTUNATELY SHE WASN'T THINKING ABOUT HERSELF SO WHEN THE TIME CAME DOWN SHE DROPPED NOW IF SHE HAD BEEN THE HEROINE OF A MORAL STORYBOOK
1547-130184-0036 RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND GONE ABOUT DOING GOOD IN A MORTIFIED BONNET WITH TRACTS IN HER POCKET BUT YOU SEE JO WASN'T A HEROINE SHE WAS ONLY A STRUGGLING HUMAN GIRL LIKE HUNDREDS OF OTHERS
1547-130184-0037 AND SHE JUST ACTED OUT HER NATURE BEING SAD CROSS LISTLESS OR ENERGETIC AS THE MOOD SUGGESTED IT'S HIGHLY VIRTUOUS TO SAY WE'LL BE GOOD BUT WE CAN'T DO IT ALL AT ONCE AND IT TAKES A LONG PULL
1547-130184-0038 A STRONG PULL AND A PULL ALL TOGETHER BEFORE SOME OF US EVEN GET OUR FEET SET IN THE RIGHT WAY JO HAD GOT SO FAR SHE WAS LEARNING TO DO HER DUTY AND TO FEEL UNHAPPY IF SHE DID NOT
1547-130184-0039 SHE HAD OFTEN SAID SHE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING SPLENDID NO MATTER HOW HARD AND NOW SHE HAD HER WISH FOR WHAT COULD BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN TO DEVOTE HER LIFE TO FATHER AND MOTHER TRYING TO MAKE HOME AS HAPPY TO THEM AS THEY HAD TO HER
1547-130184-0040 AND IF DIFFICULTIES WERE NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE SPLENDOR OF THE EFFORT WHAT COULD BE HARDER FOR A RESTLESS AMBITIOUS GIRL THAN TO GIVE UP HER OWN HOPES PLANS AND DESIRES AND CHEERFULLY LIVE FOR OTHERS
1547-130184-0041 PROVIDENCE HAD TAKEN HER AT HER WORD
1547-130184-0042 BUT BETTER BECAUSE SELF HAD NO PART IN IT
1547-130184-0043 SHE DECIDED THAT SHE WOULD TRY AND IN HER FIRST ATTEMPT SHE FOUND THE HELPS I HAVE SUGGESTED STILL ANOTHER WAS GIVEN HER AND SHE TOOK IT NOT AS A REWARD BUT AS A COMFORT
1547-130184-0044 AS CHRISTIAN TOOK THE REFRESHMENT AFFORDED BY THE LITTLE ARBOR WHERE HE RESTED AS HE CLIMBED THE HILL CALLED DIFFICULTY WHY DON'T YOU WRITE
1547-130184-0045 WHEN THE DESPONDING FIT OVER SHADOWED JO I'VE NO HEART TO WRITE AND IF I HAD NOBODY CARES FOR MY THINGS
1547-130184-0046 WRITE SOMETHING FOR US AND NEVER MIND THE REST OF THE WORLD TRY IT DEAR I'M SURE IT WOULD DO YOU GOOD AND PLEASE US VERY MUCH DON'T BELIEVE I CAN BUT
1547-130184-0047 JO GOT OUT HER DESK AND BEGAN TO OVERHAUL HER HALF FINISHED MANUSCRIPTS AN HOUR AFTERWARD HER MOTHER PEEPED IN
1547-130184-0048 WHICH CAUSED MISSUS MARCH TO SMILE AND SLIP AWAY
1547-130184-0049 JO NEVER KNEW HOW IT HAPPENED BUT SOMETHING GOT INTO THAT STORY THAT WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO READ IT FOR WHEN HER FAMILY HAD LAUGHED AND CRIED OVER IT HER FATHER SENT IT MUCH AGAINST HER WILL TO ONE OF THE POPULAR MAGAZINES
1547-130184-0050 AND TO HER UTTER SURPRISE IT WAS NOT ONLY PAID FOR BUT OTHERS REQUESTED LETTERS FROM SEVERAL PERSONS WHOSE PRAISE WAS HONOR FOLLOWED THE APPEARANCE OF THE LITTLE STORY NEWSPAPERS COPIED IT AND STRANGERS AS WELL AS FRIENDS ADMIRED IT
1547-130184-0051 FOR A SMALL THING IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS AND JO WAS MORE ASTONISHED THAN WHEN HER NOVEL WAS COMMENDED AND CONDEMNED ALL AT ONCE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
1547-130184-0052 WHAT CAN THERE BE IN A SIMPLE LITTLE STORY LIKE THAT TO MAKE PEOPLE PRAISE IT SO SHE SAID QUITE BEWILDERED THERE IS TRUTH IN IT JO THAT'S THE SECRET HUMOR AND PATHOS MAKE IT ALIVE AND YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR STYLE AT LAST
1547-130184-0053 AND PUT YOUR HEART INTO IT MY DAUGHTER
1547-130184-0054 DO YOUR BEST AND GROW AS HAPPY AS WE ARE IN YOUR SUCCESS
1547-130184-0055 I OWE IT ALL TO YOU AND MOTHER AND BETH SAID JO MORE TOUCHED BY HER FATHER'S WORDS THAN BY ANY AMOUNT OF PRAISE FROM THE WORLD SO TAUGHT BY LOVE AND SORROW JO WROTE HER LITTLE STORIES AND SENT THEM AWAY TO MAKE FRIENDS FOR THEMSELVES
1547-130184-0056 AND HER FINDING IT A VERY CHARITABLE WORLD TO SUCH HUMBLE WANDERERS FOR THEY WERE KINDLY WELCOMED AND SENT HOME COMFORTABLE TOKENS TO THEIR MOTHER LIKE DUTIFUL CHILDREN WHOM GOOD FORTUNE OVERTAKES
1547-130184-0057 WHEN AMY AND LAURIE WROTE OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT MISSUS MARCH FEARED THAT JO WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO REJOICE OVER IT BUT HER FEARS WERE SOON SET AT REST
1547-130184-0058 THE CHILDREN BEFORE SHE READ THE LETTER TWICE IT WAS A SORT OF WRITTEN DUET WHEREIN EACH GLORIFIED THE OTHER IN LOVERLIKE FASHION VERY PLEASANT TO READ AND SATISFACTORY TO THINK OF FOR NO ONE HAD ANY OBJECTION TO MAKE
1547-130184-0059 YOU LIKE IT MOTHER SAID JO AS THEY LAID DOWN THE CLOSELY WRITTEN SHEETS AND LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER YES I HOPED IT WOULD BE SO EVER SINCE AMY WROTE THAT SHE HAD REFUSED FRED
1547-130184-0060 I FELT SURE THEN THAT SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT YOU CALL THE MERCENARY SPIRIT HAD COME OVER HER AND A HINT HERE AND THERE IN HER LETTERS MADE ME SUSPECT THAT LOVE AND LAURIE WOULD WIN THE DAY HOW SHARP YOU ARE MARMEE AND HOW SILENT
1547-130184-0061 YOU NEVER SAID A WORD TO ME MOTHERS HAVE NEED OF SHARP EYES AND DISCREET TONGUES WHEN THEY HAVE GIRLS TO MANAGE I WAS HALF AFRAID TO PUT THE IDEA INTO YOUR HEAD LEST YOU SHOULD WRITE AND CONGRATULATE THEM BEFORE THE THING WAS SETTLED
1547-130184-0062 I'M NOT THE SCATTERBRAIN I WAS YOU MAY TRUST ME I'M SOBER AND SENSIBLE ENOUGH FOR ANYONE'S CONFIDANTE NOW SO YOU ARE MY DEAR AND I SHOULD HAVE MADE YOU MINE ONLY I FANCIED IT MIGHT PAIN YOU TO LEARN THAT YOUR TEDDY LOVED SOMEONE ELSE
1547-130184-0063 NOW MOTHER DID YOU REALLY THINK I COULD BE SO SILLY AND SELFISH AFTER I'D REFUSED HIS LOVE WHEN IT WAS FRESHEST IF NOT BEST I KNEW YOU WERE SINCERE THEN JO
1547-130184-0064 YOU MIGHT PERHAPS FEEL LIKE GIVING ANOTHER ANSWER FORGIVE ME DEAR I CAN'T HELP SEEING THAT YOU ARE VERY LONELY AND SOMETIMES THERE IS A HUNGRY LOOK IN YOUR EYES THAT GOES TO MY HEART SO I FANCIED THAT YOUR BOY MIGHT FILL THE EMPTY PLACE IF HE TRIED NOW
1547-130184-0065 NO MOTHER IT IS BETTER AS IT IS AND I'M GLAD AMY HAS LEARNED TO LOVE HIM BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IN ONE THING I AM LONELY AND PERHAPS IF TEDDY HAD TRIED AGAIN I MIGHT HAVE SAID YES NOT BECAUSE I LOVE HIM ANY MORE
1547-130184-0066 BUT BECAUSE I CARE MORE TO BE LOVED THAN WHEN HE WENT AWAY
1547-130184-0067 SISTERS AND BROTHERS FRIENDS AND BABIES TILL THE BEST LOVER OF ALL COMES TO GIVE YOU YOUR REWARD
1547-130184-0068 BUT I DON'T MIND WHISPERING TO MARMEE THAT I'D LIKE TO TRY ALL KINDS IT'S VERY CURIOUS BUT THE MORE I TRY TO SATISFY MYSELF WITH ALL SORTS OF NATURAL AFFECTIONS THE MORE I SEEM TO WANT I'D NO IDEA HEARTS COULD TAKE IN SO MANY
1547-130184-0069 MINE IS SO ELASTIC IT NEVER SEEMS FULL NOW AND I USED TO BE QUITE CONTENTED WITH MY FAMILY I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT I DO AND MISSUS MARCH SMILED HER WISE SMILE AS JO TURNED BACK THE LEAVES TO READ WHAT AMY SAID OF LAURIE
1547-130184-0070 IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL TO BE LOVED AS LAURIE LOVES ME HE ISN'T SENTIMENTAL DOESN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT IT BUT I SEE AND FEEL IT IN ALL HE SAYS AND DOES AND IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY AND SO HUMBLE
1547-130184-0071 THAT I DON'T SEEM TO BE THE SAME GIRL I WAS I NEVER KNEW HOW GOOD AND GENEROUS AND TENDER HE WAS TILL NOW FOR HE LETS ME READ HIS HEART AND I FIND IT FULL OF NOBLE IMPULSES AND HOPES AND PURPOSES AND AM SO PROUD TO KNOW IT'S MINE
1547-130184-0072 HE SAYS HE FEELS AS IF HE COULD MAKE A PROSPEROUS VOYAGE NOW WITH ME ABOARD AS MATE AND LOTS OF LOVE FOR BALLAST I PRAY HE MAY AND TRY TO BE ALL HE BELIEVES ME
1547-130184-0073 FOR I LOVE MY GALLANT CAPTAIN WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL AND MIGHT AND NEVER WILL DESERT HIM WHILE GOD LETS US BE TOGETHER
1547-130184-0074 WHEN TWO PEOPLE LOVE AND LIVE FOR ONE ANOTHER AND THAT'S OUR COOL RESERVED AND WORLDLY AMY TRULY LOVE DOES WORK MIRACLES HOW VERY VERY HAPPY THEY MUST BE
1547-130184-0075 AS ONE MIGHT SHUT THE COVERS OF A LOVELY ROMANCE WHICH HOLDS THE READER FAST TILL THE END COMES AND HE FINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN THE WORKADAY WORLD AGAIN
1547-130184-0076 BY AND BY JO ROAMED AWAY UPSTAIRS FOR IT WAS RAINY AND SHE COULD NOT WALK A RESTLESS SPIRIT POSSESSED HER AND THE OLD FEELING CAME AGAIN NOT BITTER AS IT ONCE WAS BUT A SORROWFULLY PATIENT WONDER
1547-130184-0077 WHY ONE SISTER SHOULD HAVE ALL SHE ASKED THE OTHER NOTHING IT WAS NOT TRUE SHE KNEW THAT AND TRIED TO PUT IT AWAY
1547-130184-0078 AND AMY'S HAPPINESS WOKE THE HUNGRY LONGING FOR SOMEONE TO LOVE WITH HEART AND SOUL AND CLING TO WHILE GOD LET THEM BE TOGETHER UP IN THE GARRET WHERE JO'S UNQUIET WANDERINGS ENDED
1547-130184-0079 STOOD FOUR LITTLE WOODEN CHESTS IN A ROW EACH MARKED WITH ITS OWNERS NAME AND EACH FILLED WITH RELICS OF THE CHILDHOOD AND GIRLHOOD ENDED NOW FOR ALL JO GLANCED INTO THEM AND WHEN SHE CAME TO HER OWN
1547-130184-0080 LEANED HER CHIN ON THE EDGE AND STARED ABSENTLY AT THE CHAOTIC COLLECTION TILL A BUNDLE OF OLD EXERCISE BOOKS CAUGHT HER EYE SHE DREW THEM OUT TURNED THEM OVER AND RELIVED THAT PLEASANT WINTER AT KIND MISSUS KIRKE'S
1547-130184-0081 SHE HAD SMILED AT FIRST THEN SHE LOOKED THOUGHTFUL NEXT SAD AND WHEN SHE CAME TO A LITTLE MESSAGE WRITTEN IN THE PROFESSOR'S HAND HER LIPS BEGAN TO TREMBLE THE BOOKS SLID OUT OF HER LAP AND SHE SAT LOOKING AT THE FRIENDLY WORDS
1547-130184-0082 AND TOUCHED A TENDER SPOT IN HER HEART
1547-130184-0083 I MAY BE A LITTLE LATE BUT I SHALL SURELY COME
1547-130184-0084 SO KIND SO GOOD SO PATIENT WITH ME ALWAYS MY DEAR OLD FRITZ I DIDN'T VALUE HIM HALF ENOUGH WHEN I HAD HIM BUT NOW HOW I SHOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM FOR EVERYONE SEEMS GOING AWAY FROM ME AND I'M ALL ALONE
1547-130184-0085 AND HOLDING THE LITTLE PAPER FAST AS IF IT WERE A PROMISE YET TO BE FULFILLED JO LAID HER HEAD DOWN ON A COMFORTABLE RAG BAG AND CRIED AS IF IN OPPOSITION TO THE RAIN PATTERING ON THE ROOF
1547-130184-0086 WAS IT ALL SELF PITY LONELINESS OR LOW SPIRITS OR WAS IT THE WAKING UP OF A SENTIMENT WHICH HAD BIDED ITS TIME AS PATIENTLY AS ITS INSPIRER
