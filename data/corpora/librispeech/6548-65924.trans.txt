6548-65924-0000 NOTHING WOULD GROW THERE THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH STONES AND THE SANDY SOIL DEFIED ALL ATTEMPTS TO ENRICH IT A FEW STUNTED OAKS ROSE HERE AND THERE ABOVE THE THORNS AND BROOM PLANT
6548-65924-0001 FOR THE FLOODS OF WINTER HAVE DEPOSITED IN SOME OF THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCK SUFFICIENT SOIL TO SUSTAIN THEM AND THE WILD CLEMATIS AND HONEYSUCKLE THAT CLING TO THEIR BRANCHES ON REACHING THIS GROVE
6548-65924-0002 MAURICE CONSULTED HIS WATCH IT MARKED THE HOUR OF MID DAY HE HAD SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS LATE BUT HE WAS MORE THAN AN HOUR IN ADVANCE OF THE APPOINTED TIME
6548-65924-0003 HE SEATED HIMSELF UPON A HIGH ROCK FROM WHICH HE COULD SURVEY
6548-65924-0004 AND WAITED THE DAY WAS MAGNIFICENT THE AIR INTENSELY HOT THE RAYS OF THE AUGUST SUN FELL WITH SCORCHING VIOLENCE UPON THE SANDY SOIL AND WITHERED THE FEW PLANTS WHICH HAD SPRUNG UP SINCE THE LAST RAIN
6548-65924-0005 THE STILLNESS WAS PROFOUND ALMOST TERRIBLE NOT A SOUND BROKE THE SILENCE NOT EVEN THE BUZZING OF AN INSECT NOR A WHISPER OF BREEZE IN THE TREES ALL NATURE SEEMED SLEEPING AND ON NO SIDE
6548-65924-0006 WAS THERE ANYTHING TO REMIND ONE OF LIFE MOTION OR MANKIND THIS REPOSE OF NATURE WHICH CONTRASTED SO VIVIDLY WITH THE TUMULT RAGING IN HIS OWN HEART EXERTED A BENEFICIAL EFFECT UPON MAURICE
6548-65924-0007 THESE FEW MOMENTS OF SOLITUDE AFFORDED HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO REGAIN HIS COMPOSURE TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS SCATTERED BY THE STORM OF PASSION WHICH HAD SWEPT OVER HIS SOUL AS LEAVES ARE SCATTERED BY THE FIERCE NOVEMBER GALE
6548-65924-0008 WITH SORROW COMES EXPERIENCE AND THAT CRUEL KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE WHICH TEACHES ONE TO GUARD ONE'S SELF AGAINST ONE'S HOPES IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HEARD THE CONVERSATION OF THESE PEASANTS THAT MAURICE FULLY REALIZED THE HORROR
6548-65924-0009 SUDDENLY PRECIPITATED FROM THE SOCIAL EMINENCE WHICH HE HAD ATTAINED HE FOUND IN THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATIONS INTO WHICH HE WAS CAST ONLY HATRED DISTRUST AND SCORN
6548-65924-0010 BOTH FACTIONS DESPISED AND DENIED HIM TRAITOR CRIED ONE THIEF CRIED THE OTHER HE NO LONGER HELD ANY SOCIAL STATUS HE WAS THE FALLEN MAN THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN AND WHO WAS NO MORE
6548-65924-0011 WAS NOT THE EXCESSIVE MISERY OF SUCH A POSITION A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION OF THE STRANGEST AND WILDEST RESOLUTIONS THIS THOUGHT MADE MAURICE TREMBLE
6548-65924-0012 CONNECTING THE STORIES OF THE PEASANTS WITH THE WORDS ADDRESSED TO CHANLOUINEAU AT ESCORVAL
6548-65924-0013 ON THE PRECEDING EVENING HE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS REPORT OF MARIE ANNE'S APPROACHING MARRIAGE TO THE YOUNG FANNER WAS NOT SO IMPROBABLE
6548-65924-0014 TO AN UNCULTURED PEASANT FROM MERCENARY MOTIVES CERTAINLY NOT SINCE HE HAD JUST REFUSED AN ALLIANCE OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN PROUD IN HIS DAYS OF PROSPERITY COULD IT BE IN ORDER TO SATISFY HIS WOUNDED PRIDE THEN
6548-65924-0015 PERHAPS HE DID NOT WISH IT TO BE SAID THAT HE OWED ANYTHING TO A SON IN LAW MAURICE WAS EXHAUSTING ALL HIS INGENUITY AND PENETRATION IN ENDEAVORING TO SOLVE THIS MYSTERY WHEN AT LAST ON A FOOT PATH
6548-65924-0016 WHICH CROSSES THE WASTE A WOMAN APPEARED MARIE ANNE HE ROSE BUT FEARING OBSERVATION DID NOT VENTURE TO LEAVE THE SHELTER OF THE GROVE MARIE ANNE MUST HAVE FELT A SIMILAR FEAR FOR SHE HURRIED ON
6548-65924-0017 CASTING ANXIOUS GLANCES ON EVERY SIDE AS SHE RAN MAURICE REMARKED NOT WITHOUT SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS BARE HEADED AND THAT SHE HAD NEITHER SHAWL NOR SCARF ABOUT HER SHOULDERS
6548-65924-0018 AS SHE REACHED THE EDGE OF THE WOOD HE SPRANG TOWARD HER
6548-65924-0019 WAS NOW GENTLY WITHDRAWN WITH SO SAD A GESTURE THAT HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THERE WAS NO HOPE I CAME MAURICE SHE BEGAN BECAUSE I COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHT OF YOUR ANXIETY
6548-65924-0020 BY DOING SO I HAVE BETRAYED MY FATHER'S CONFIDENCE HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HOME I HASTENED HERE AND YET I PROMISED HIM ONLY TWO HOURS AGO THAT I WOULD NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN YOU HEAR ME NEVER SHE SPOKE HURRIEDLY
6548-65924-0021 BUT MAURICE WAS APPALLED BY THE FIRMNESS OF HER ACCENT HAD HE BEEN LESS AGITATED HE WOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT A TERRIBLE EFFORT THIS SEMBLANCE OF CALMNESS COST THE YOUNG GIRL HE WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FROM HER PALLOR FROM THE CONTRACTION OF HER LIPS
6548-65924-0022 FROM THE REDNESS OF THE EYELIDS WHICH SHE HAD VAINLY BATHED WITH FRESH WATER AND WHICH BETRAYED THE TEARS THAT HAD FALLEN DURING THE NIGHT IF I HAVE COME SHE CONTINUED IT IS ONLY TO TELL YOU THAT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE AS WELL AS FOR MINE
6548-65924-0023 EVEN THE SLIGHTEST SHADOW OF A HOPE ALL IS OVER WE ARE SEPARATED FOREVER ONLY WEAK NATURES REVOLT AGAINST A DESTINY WHICH THEY CANNOT ALTER LET US ACCEPT OUR FATE UNCOMPLAININGLY
6548-65924-0024 I WISHED TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE AND TO SAY THIS HAVE COURAGE MAURICE GO AWAY LEAVE ESCORVAL FORGET ME FORGET YOU MARIE ANNE

6548-65924-0026 POOR FOOL THAT I WAS I BELIEVED THAT YOU WOULD FIND A WAY TO TOUCH YOUR FATHER'S HEART SHE BLUSHED SLIGHTLY HESITATED AND SAID I HAVE THROWN MYSELF AT MY FATHER'S FEET
6548-65924-0027 HE REPULSED ME MAURICE WAS THUNDERSTRUCK BUT RECOVERING HIMSELF IT WAS BECAUSE YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO HIM HE EXCLAIMED IN A PASSION OF FURY BUT I SHALL KNOW
6548-65924-0028 WHAT RIGHT HAS HE TO RUIN MY HAPPINESS WITH HIS CAPRICES I LOVE YOU BY RIGHT OF THIS LOVE YOU ARE MINE MINE RATHER THAN HIS I WILL MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THIS YOU SHALL SEE WHERE IS HE WHERE CAN I FIND HIM
6548-65924-0029 ALREADY HE WAS STARTING TO GO HE KNEW NOT WHERE MARIE ANNE CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARM REMAIN SHE COMMANDED REMAIN SO YOU HAVE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND ME MAURICE AH WELL YOU MUST KNOW THE TRUTH
6548-65924-0030 I AM ACQUAINTED NOW WITH THE REASONS OF MY FATHER'S REFUSAL AND THOUGH HIS DECISION SHOULD COST ME MY LIFE I APPROVE IT DO NOT GO TO FIND MY FATHER IF MOVED BY YOUR PRAYERS HE GAVE HIS CONSENT
6548-65924-0031 I SHOULD HAVE THE COURAGE TO REFUSE MINE MAURICE WAS SO BESIDE HIMSELF THAT THIS REPLY DID NOT ENLIGHTEN HIM
6548-65924-0032 AND WITH NO REMORSE FOR THE INSULT HE ADDRESSED TO THIS WOMAN WHOM HE LOVED SO DEEPLY HE EXCLAIMED IS IT FOR CHANLOUINEAU THEN THAT YOU ARE RESERVING YOUR CONSENT HE BELIEVES SO SINCE HE GOES ABOUT EVERYWHERE SAYING THAT YOU WILL SOON BE HIS WIFE
6548-65924-0033 MARIE ANNE SHUDDERED AS IF A KNIFE HAD ENTERED HER VERY HEART AND YET THERE WAS MORE SORROW THAN ANGER IN THE GLANCE SHE CAST UPON MAURICE MUST I STOOP SO LOW AS TO DEFEND MYSELF FROM SUCH AN IMPUTATION SHE ASKED SADLY
6548-65924-0034 MUST I DECLARE THAT IF EVEN I SUSPECT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN CHANLOUINEAU AND MY FATHER I HAVE NOT BEEN CONSULTED MUST I TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE SOME SACRIFICES WHICH ARE BEYOND THE STRENGTH OF POOR HUMAN NATURE
6548-65924-0035 UNDERSTAND THIS I HAVE FOUND STRENGTH TO RENOUNCE THE MAN I LOVE I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO ACCEPT ANOTHER IN HIS PLACE MAURICE HUNG HIS HEAD ABASHED BY HER EARNEST WORDS
6548-65924-0036 DAZZLED BY THE SUBLIME EXPRESSION OF HER FACE REASON RETURNED HE REALIZED THE ENORMITY OF HIS SUSPICIONS AND WAS HORRIFIED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING DARED TO GIVE UTTERANCE TO THEM OH PARDON HE FALTERED PARDON
6548-65924-0037 WHAT DID THE MYSTERIOUS CAUSES OF ALL THESE EVENTS WHICH HAD SO RAPIDLY SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER
6548-65924-0038 OR MARIE ANNE'S RETICENCE MATTER TO HIM NOW HE WAS SEEKING SOME CHANCE OF SALVATION HE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD FOUND IT WE MUST FLY HE EXCLAIMED FLY AT ONCE WITHOUT PAUSING TO LOOK BACK

6548-65924-0040 WHAT WHILE MISFORTUNE IS CRUSHING MY POOR FATHER TO THE EARTH SHALL I ADD DESPAIR AND SHAME TO HIS SORROWS HIS FRIENDS HAVE DESERTED HIM SHALL I HIS DAUGHTER ALSO ABANDON HIM AH
6548-65924-0041 IF MY FATHER YESTERDAY WHEN I BELIEVED HIM THE OWNER OF SAIRMEUSE HAD DEMANDED THE SACRIFICE TO WHICH I CONSENTED LAST EVENING I MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE RESOLVED UPON THE EXTREME MEASURE YOU HAVE COUNSELLED
6548-65924-0042 IN BROAD DAYLIGHT I MIGHT HAVE LEFT SAIRMEUSE ON THE ARM OF MY LOVER IT IS NOT THE WORLD THAT I FEAR
6548-65924-0043 ONE CANNOT CONSENT TO DESERT THE POOR ABODE OF A DESPAIRING AND PENNILESS PARENT LEAVE ME MAURICE WHERE HONOR HOLDS ME IT WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT FOR ME WHO AM THE DAUGHTER OF GENERATIONS OF PEASANTS TO BECOME A PEASANT
6548-65924-0044 GO I CANNOT ENDURE MORE GO AND REMEMBER THAT ONE CANNOT BE UTTERLY WRETCHED IF ONE'S CONSCIENCE IS CLEAN AND ONE'S DUTY FULFILLED
