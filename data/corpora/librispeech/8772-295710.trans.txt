8772-295710-0000 THEN FAINTED INTO UNREALITY BEFORE THE SHEER WONDER OF WHAT HE SAW IN THE BRIEF INTERVAL IT TAKES TO SNAP THE FINGERS THE CLIMAX WAS THUS SO HURRIEDLY UPON HIM
8772-295710-0001 AND THROUGH IT ALL HE WAS CLEARLY AWARE OF THE PAIR OF LITTLE HUMAN FIGURES MAN AND WOMAN STANDING ERECT AND COMMANDING AT THE CENTRE KNEW TOO THAT SHE DIRECTED AND CONTROLLED
8772-295710-0002 WHILE HE IN SOME SECONDARY FASHION SUPPORTED HER AND EVER WATCHED BUT BOTH WERE DIM DROPPED SOMEWHERE INTO A LESSER SCALE
8772-295710-0003 IT WAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PRESENCE HOWEVER THAT ALONE ENABLED HIM TO KEEP HIS POWERS IN HAND AT ALL BUT FOR THESE TWO HUMAN BEINGS THERE WITHIN POSSIBLE REACH HE MUST HAVE CLOSED HIS EYES AND SWOONED
8772-295710-0004 FOR A TEMPEST THAT SEEMED TO TOSS LOOSE STARS ABOUT THE SKY SWEPT ROUND ABOUT HIM POURING UP THE PILLARED AVENUE IN FRONT OF THE PROCESSION A BLAST OF GIANT ENERGY OF LIBERTY CAME THROUGH
8772-295710-0005 FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS CIRCLING SPIRALLY ABOUT HIM LIKE A WHIRLWIND CAME THIS REVIVAL OF LIFE THAT SOUGHT TO DIP ITSELF ONCE MORE IN MATTER AND IN FORM IT CAME TO THE ACCURATE OUT LINE OF ITS FORM THEY HAD TRACED FOR IT
8772-295710-0006 HE HELD HIS MIND STEADY ENOUGH TO REALISE THAT IT WAS AKIN TO WHAT MEN CALL A DESCENT OF SOME SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT THAT WAKENS A BODY OF BELIEVERS INTO FAITH A RACE AN ENTIRE NATION
8772-295710-0007 ONLY THAT HE EXPERIENCED IT IN THIS BRIEF CONCENTRATED FORM BEFORE IT HAS SCATTERED DOWN INTO TEN THOUSAND HEARTS HERE HE KNEW ITS SOURCE AND ESSENCE BEHIND THE VEIL CRUDELY UNMANAGEABLE AS YET
8772-295710-0008 HE FELT IT RUSHING LOOSE BEHIND APPEARANCES THERE WAS THIS AMAZING IMPACT OF A TWISTING SWINGING FORCE THAT STORMED DOWN AS THOUGH IT WOULD BEND AND COIL THE VERY RIBS OF THE OLD STUBBORN HILLS
8772-295710-0009 IT SOUGHT TO WARM THEM WITH THE STRESS OF ITS OWN IRRESISTIBLE LIFE STREAM TO BEAT THEM INTO SHAPE AND MAKE PLIABLE THEIR OBSTINATE RESISTANCE THROUGH ALL THINGS THE IMPULSE POURED AND SPREAD LIKE FIRE AT WHITE HEAT
8772-295710-0010 YET NOTHING VISIBLE CAME AS YET NO ALTERATION IN THE ACTUAL LANDSCAPE NO SIGN OF CHANGE IN THINGS FAMILIAR TO HIS EYES WHILE IMPETUS THUS FOUGHT AGAINST INERTIA
8772-295710-0011 CALM AND UNTOUCHED HIMSELF HE LAY OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE OF EVOCATION WATCHING WAITING SCARCELY DARING TO BREATHE YET WELL AWARE THAT ANY MINUTE THE SCENE WOULD TRANSFER ITSELF FROM MEMORY THAT WAS SUBJECTIVE
8772-295710-0012 TO MATTER THAT WAS OBJECTIVE AND THEN IN A FLASH THE BRIDGE WAS BUILT AND THE TRANSFER WAS ACCOMPLISHED HOW OR WHERE HE DID NOT SEE HE COULD NOT TELL IT WAS THERE BEFORE HE KNEW IT
8772-295710-0013 THERE BEFORE HIS NORMAL EARTHLY SIGHT HE SAW IT AS HE SAW THE HANDS HE WAS HOLDING STUPIDLY UP TO SHIELD HIS FACE
8772-295710-0014 LATENT FOR CENTURIES CAME POURING DOWN THE EMPTY WADI BED PREPARED FOR ITS RECEPTION THROUGH STONES AND SAND AND BOULDERS IT CAME IN AN IMPETUOUS HURRICANE OF POWER
8772-295710-0015 THE LIBERATION OF ITS LIFE APPALLED HIM ALL THAT WAS FREE UNTIED RESPONDED INSTANTLY LIKE CHAFF LOOSE OBJECTS FLED TOWARDS IT THERE WAS A YIELDING IN THE HILLS AND PRECIPICES
8772-295710-0016 AND EVEN IN THE MASS OF DESERT WHICH PROVIDED THEIR FOUNDATION THE HINGES OF THE SAND WENT CREAKING IN THE NIGHT IT SHAPED FOR ITSELF A BODILY OUTLINE
8772-295710-0017 YET MOST STRANGELY NOTHING DEFINITELY MOVED HOW COULD HE EXPRESS THE VIOLENT CONTRADICTION FOR THE IMMOBILITY WAS APPARENT ONLY A SHAM A COUNTERFEIT
8772-295710-0018 HE SAW THE TWO THINGS SIDE BY SIDE THE OUTER IMMOBILITY THE SENSES COMMONLY AGREE UPON AND THIS AMAZING FLYING OUT OF THEIR INNER INVISIBLE SUBSTANCE
8772-295710-0019 TOWARDS THE VORTEX OF ATTRACTING LIFE THAT SUCKED THEM IN FOR STUBBORN MATTER TURNED DOCILE BEFORE THE STRESS OF THIS RETURNING LIFE TAUGHT SOMEWHERE TO BE PLASTIC IT WAS BEING MOULDED INTO AN APPROACH TO BODILY OUTLINE
8772-295710-0020 THE TWO OFFICIATING HUMAN BEINGS SAFE AT THE STATIONARY CENTRE AND HIMSELF JUST OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE OF OPERATION ALONE REMAINED UNTOUCHED AND UNAFFECTED BUT A FEW FEET IN ANY DIRECTION FOR ANY ONE OF THEM MEANT
8772-295710-0021 INSTANTANEOUS DEATH THEY WOULD BE ABSORBED INTO THE VORTEX MERE CORPUSCLES PRESSED INTO THE SERVICE OF THIS SPHERE OF ACTION OF A MIGHTY BODY HOW THESE PERCEPTIONS REACHED HIM WITH SUCH CONVICTION HENRIOT COULD NEVER SAY
8772-295710-0022 HE KNEW IT BECAUSE HE FELT IT SOMETHING FELL ABOUT HIM FROM THE SKY THAT ALREADY PALED TOWARDS THE DAWN THE STARS THEMSELVES IT SEEMED CONTRIBUTED SOME PART OF THE TERRIFIC FLOWING IMPULSE THAT CONQUERED MATTER
8772-295710-0023 AND SHAPED ITSELF THIS PHYSICAL EXPRESSION THEN BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO FASHION ANY PRECONCEIVED IDEA OF WHAT VISIBLE FORM THIS POTENT LIFE MIGHT ASSUME HE WAS AWARE OF FURTHER CHANGE
8772-295710-0024 IT CAME AT THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE INTERVAL AFTER THE BEGINNING THIS CERTAINTY THAT TO AND FRO ABOUT HIM AS YET HOWEVER INDETERMINATE PASSED MAGNITUDES THAT WERE STUPENDOUS AS THE DESERT THERE WAS BEAUTY IN THEM TOO
8772-295710-0025 THOUGH A TERRIBLE BEAUTY HARDLY OF THIS EARTH AT ALL A FRAGMENT OF OLD EGYPT HAD RETURNED A LITTLE PORTION OF THAT VAST BODY OF BELIEF THAT ONCE WAS EGYPT
8772-295710-0026 EVOKED BY THE WORSHIP OF ONE HUMAN HEART PASSIONATELY SINCERE THE KA OF EGYPT STEPPED BACK TO VISIT THE MATERIAL IT ONCE INFORMED THE SAND YET ONLY A PORTION CAME
8772-295710-0027 HENRIOT CLEARLY REALISED THAT IT STRETCHED FORTH AN ARM FINDING NO MASS OF WORSHIPPERS THROUGH WHOM IT MIGHT EXPRESS ITSELF COMPLETELY IT PRESSED INANIMATE MATTER THUS INTO ITS SERVICE HERE WAS THE BEGINNING THE WOMAN HAD SPOKEN OF
8772-295710-0028 LITTLE OPENING CLUE ENTIRE RECONSTRUCTION LAY PERHAPS BEYOND AND HENRIOT NEXT REALISED THAT THESE MAGNITUDES IN WHICH THIS GROUP ENERGY SOUGHT TO CLOTHE ITSELF AS VISIBLE FORM WERE CURIOUSLY FAMILIAR
8772-295710-0029 IT WAS NOT A NEW THING THAT HE WOULD SEE BOOMING SOFTLY AS THEY DROPPED DOWNWARDS THROUGH THE SKY WITH A MOTION THE SIZE OF THEM RENDERED DELUSIVE THEY TROOPED UP THE AVENUE TOWARDS THE CENTRAL POINT THAT SUMMONED THEM
8772-295710-0030 HE REALISED THE GIANT FLOCK OF THEM DESCENT OF FEARFUL BEAUTY OUTLINING A TYPE OF LIFE DENIED TO THE WORLD FOR AGES COUNTLESS AS THIS SAND THAT BLEW AGAINST HIS SKIN
8772-295710-0031 CAREERING OVER THE WASTE OF DESERT MOVED THE ARMY OF DARK SPLENDOURS THAT DWARFED ANY ORGANIC STRUCTURE CALLED A BODY MEN HAVE EVER KNOWN HE RECOGNISED THEM COLD IN HIM OF DEATH THOUGH THE OUTLINES REARED HIGHER THAN THE PYRAMIDS
8772-295710-0032 AND TOWERED UP TO HIDE WHOLE GROUPS OF STARS YES HE RECOGNISED THEM IN THEIR PARTIAL REVELATION THOUGH HE NEVER SAW THE MONSTROUS HOST COMPLETE BUT ONE OF THEM HE REALISED POSING ITS ETERNAL RIDDLE TO THE SANDS
8772-295710-0033 HAD OF OLD BEEN GLIMPSED SUFFICIENTLY TO SEIZE ITS FORM IN STONE YET POORLY SEIZED AS A DOLL MAY STAND FOR THE DIGNITY OF A HUMAN BEING OR A CHILD'S TOY REPRESENT AN ENGINE THAT DRAWS TRAINS
8772-295710-0034 AND HE KNELT THERE ON HIS NARROW LEDGE THE WORLD OF MEN FORGOTTEN THE POWER THAT CAUGHT HIM WAS TOO GREAT A THING FOR WONDER OR FOR FEAR HE EVEN FELT NO AWE
8772-295710-0035 SENSATION OF ANY KIND THAT CAN BE NAMED OR REALISED LEFT HIM UTTERLY HE FORGOT HIMSELF HE MERELY WATCHED THE GLORY NUMBED HIM BLOCK AND PENCIL AS THE REASON OF HIS PRESENCE THERE AT ALL
8772-295710-0036 NO LONGER EXISTED YET ONE SMALL LINK REMAINED THAT HELD HIM TO SOME KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS OF EARTHLY THINGS HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THIS THAT BEING JUST OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE OF EVOCATION HE WAS SAFE
8772-295710-0037 AND THAT THE MAN AND WOMAN BEING STATIONARY IN ITS UNTOUCHED CENTRE WERE ALSO SAFE BUT THAT A MOVEMENT OF SIX INCHES IN ANY DIRECTION MEANT FOR ANY ONE OF THEM INSTANT DEATH
8772-295710-0038 WHAT WAS IT THEN THAT SUDDENLY STRENGTHENED THIS SOLITARY LINK SO THAT THE CHAIN TAUTENED AND HE FELT THE PULL OF IT HENRIOT COULD NOT SAY HE CAME BACK WITH THE RUSH OF A DESCENDING DROP TO THE REALISATION DIMLY
8772-295710-0039 VAGUELY AS FROM GREAT DISTANCE THAT HE WAS WITH THESE TWO NOW AT THIS MOMENT IN THE WADI HOF AND THAT THE COLD OF DAWN WAS IN THE AIR ABOUT HIM THE CHILL BREATH OF THE DESERT MADE HIM SHIVER
8772-295710-0040 BUT AT FIRST SO DEEPLY HAD HIS SOUL BEEN DIPPED IN THIS FRAGMENT OF ANCIENT WORSHIP HE COULD REMEMBER NOTHING MORE SOMEWHERE LAY A LITTLE SPOT OF STREETS AND HOUSES ITS NAME ESCAPED HIM
8772-295710-0041 HE HAD ONCE BEEN THERE THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE BUT INSIGNIFICANT PEOPLE WHO WERE THEY AND WHAT HAD HE TO DO WITH THEM ALL RECENT MEMORIES HAD BEEN DROWNED IN THE TIDE THAT FLOODED HIM FROM AN IMMEASURABLE PAST
8772-295710-0042 AND WHO WERE THEY THESE TWO BEINGS STANDING ON THE WHITE FLOOR OF SAND BELOW HIM FOR A LONG TIME HE COULD NOT RECOVER THEIR NAMES YET HE REMEMBERED THEM AND THUS ROBBED OF ASSOCIATION THAT NAMES BRING
8772-295710-0043 AND FOR THIS REASON THE EVOCATION HAD BEEN PARTIAL ONLY THE ADMIXTURE OF AN EVIL MOTIVE WAS THE FLAW THAT MARRED COMPLETE SUCCESS THE NAMES THEN FLASHED UPON HIM LADY STATHAM RICHARD VANCE
8772-295710-0044 VANCE WITH A HORRID DROP FROM SPLENDOUR INTO SOMETHING MEAN AND SORDID HENRIOT FELT THE PAIN OF IT THE MOTIVE OF THE MAN WAS SO INSIGNIFICANT HIS PURPOSE SO ATROCIOUS
8772-295710-0045 MORE AND MORE WITH THE NAME CAME BACK HIS FIRST REPUGNANCE FEAR SUSPICION AND HUMAN TERROR CAUGHT HIM HE SHRIEKED BUT AS IN NIGHTMARE NO SOUND ESCAPED HIS LIPS HE TRIED TO MOVE
8772-295710-0046 A WILD DESIRE TO INTERFERE TO PROTECT TO PREVENT FLUNG HIM FORWARD CLOSE TO THE DIZZY EDGE OF THE GULF BELOW BUT HIS MUSCLES REFUSED OBEDIENCE TO THE WILL
8772-295710-0047 THAT IT DISLOCATED THE MACHINERY OF CLAIRVOYANT VISION THE INNER PERCEPTION CLOUDED AND GREW DARK OUTER AND INNER MINGLED IN VIOLENT INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION THE WRENCH SEEMED ALMOST PHYSICAL
8772-295710-0048 IT HAPPENED ALL AT ONCE RETREAT AND CONTINUATION FOR A MOMENT SOMEHOW COMBINED AND IF HE DID NOT DEFINITELY SEE THE AWFUL THING AT LEAST HE WAS AWARE THAT IT HAD COME TO PASS
8772-295710-0049 HE WITNESSED IT THE SUPREME MOMENT OF EVOCATION WAS CLOSE LIFE THROUGH THAT AWFUL SANDY VORTEX WHIRLED AND RAGED LOOSE PARTICLES SHOWERED AND PELTED
8772-295710-0050 CAUGHT BY THE DRAUGHT OF VEHEMENT LIFE THAT MOULDED THE SUBSTANCE OF THE DESERT INTO IMPERIAL OUTLINE WHEN SUDDENLY SHOT THE LITTLE EVIL THING ACROSS THAT MARRED AND BLASTED IT
8772-295710-0051 INTO THE WHIRLPOOL FLEW FORWARD A PARTICLE OF MATERIAL THAT WAS A HUMAN BEING AND THE GROUP SOUL CAUGHT AND USED IT THE ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENT HENRIOT DID NOT CLAIM TO SEE
8772-295710-0052 HE WAS A WITNESS BUT A WITNESS WHO COULD GIVE NO EVIDENCE WHETHER THE WOMAN WAS PUSHED OF SET INTENTION OR WHETHER SOME DETAIL OF SOUND AND PATTERN WAS FALSELY USED TO EFFECT THE TERRIBLE RESULT HE WAS HELPLESS TO DETERMINE
8772-295710-0053 HE PRETENDS NO ITEMISED ACCOUNT SHE WENT IN ONE SECOND WITH APPALLING SWIFTNESS SHE DISAPPEARED SWALLOWED OUT OF SPACE AND TIME WITHIN THAT AWFUL MAW
8772-295710-0054 ONE LITTLE CORPUSCLE AMONG A MILLION THROUGH WHICH THE LIFE NOW STALKING THE DESERT WASTES MOULDED ITSELF A TROOP LIKE BODY SAND TOOK HER THERE FOLLOWED EMPTINESS
8772-295710-0055 A HUSH OF UNUTTERABLE SILENCE STILLNESS PEACE MOVEMENT AND SOUND INSTANTLY RETIRED WHENCE THEY CAME THE AVENUES OF MEMORY CLOSED
8772-295710-0056 THE SPLENDOURS ALL WENT DOWN INTO THEIR SANDY TOMBS THE MOON HAD SUNK INTO THE LIBYAN WILDERNESS THE EASTERN SKY WAS RED
8772-295710-0057 THE DAWN DREW OUT THAT WONDROUS SWEETNESS OF THE DESERT WHICH IS AS SISTER TO THE SWEETNESS THAT THE MOONLIGHT BRINGS THE DESERT SETTLED BACK TO SLEEP HUGE UNFATHOMABLE
8772-295710-0058 CHARGED TO THE BRIM WITH LIFE THAT WATCHES WAITS AND YET CONCEALS ITSELF BEHIND THE RUINS OF APPARENT DESOLATION AND THE WADI EMPTY AT HIS FEET
8772-295710-0059 FILLED SLOWLY WITH THE GENTLE LITTLE WINDS THAT BRING THE SUNRISE THEN ACROSS THE PALE GLIMMERING OF SAND HENRIOT SAW A FIGURE MOVING IT CAME QUICKLY TOWARDS HIM
8772-295710-0060 YET UNSTEADILY AND WITH A HURRY THAT WAS UGLY VANCE WAS ON THE WAY TO FETCH HIM AND THE HORROR OF THE MAN'S APPROACH STRUCK HIM LIKE A HAMMER IN THE FACE HE CLOSED HIS EYES
8772-295710-0061 SINKING BACK TO HIDE BUT BEFORE HE SWOONED THERE REACHED HIM THE CLATTER OF THE MURDERER'S TREAD AS HE BEGAN TO CLIMB OVER THE SPLINTERED ROCKS
8772-295710-0062 AND THE FAINT ECHO OF HIS VOICE CALLING HIM BY NAME FALSELY AND IN PRETENCE
