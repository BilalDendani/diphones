7335-290365-0000 WHETHER THE SAME IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE REMAINING THERE CAN BE TWO PERSONS AS TO THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION WHETHER THE SAME IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE REMAINING THERE MAY BE TWO DISTINCT PERSONS
7335-290365-0001 WHICH QUESTION SEEMS TO ME TO BE BUILT ON THIS WHETHER THE SAME IMMATERIAL BEING BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE ACTION OF ITS PAST DURATION MAY BE WHOLLY STRIPPED OF ALL THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS PAST EXISTENCE
7335-290365-0002 AND LOSE IT BEYOND THE POWER OF EVER RETRIEVING IT AGAIN AND SO AS IT WERE BEGINNING A NEW ACCOUNT FROM A NEW PERIOD HAVE A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT CANNOT REACH BEYOND THIS NEW STATE ALL THOSE WHO HOLD PRE EXISTENCE ARE EVIDENTLY OF THIS MIND
7335-290365-0003 SINCE THEY ALLOW THE SOUL TO HAVE NO REMAINING CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHAT IT DID IN THAT PRE EXISTENT STATE EITHER WHOLLY SEPARATE FROM BODY OR INFORMING ANY OTHER BODY AND IF THEY SHOULD NOT IT IS PLAIN EXPERIENCE WOULD BE AGAINST THEM
7335-290365-0004 SO THAT PERSONAL IDENTITY REACHING NO FURTHER THAN CONSCIOUSNESS REACHES A PRE EXISTENT SPIRIT NOT HAVING CONTINUED SO MANY AGES IN A STATE OF SILENCE MUST NEEDS MAKE DIFFERENT PERSONS
7335-290365-0005 SUPPOSE A CHRISTIAN PLATONIST OR A PYTHAGOREAN SHOULD UPON GOD'S HAVING ENDED ALL HIS WORKS OF CREATION THE SEVENTH DAY THINK HIS SOUL HATH EXISTED EVER SINCE AND SHOULD IMAGINE IT HAS REVOLVED IN SEVERAL HUMAN BODIES
7335-290365-0006 AS I ONCE MET WITH ONE WHO WAS PERSUADED HIS HAD BEEN THE SOUL OF SOCRATES HOW REASONABLY I WILL NOT DISPUTE THIS I KNOW THAT IN THE POST HE FILLED WHICH WAS NO INCONSIDERABLE ONE HE PASSED FOR A VERY RATIONAL MAN
7335-290365-0007 WOULD ANY ONE SAY THAT HE BEING NOT CONSCIOUS OF ANY OF SOCRATES'S ACTIONS OR THOUGHTS COULD BE THE SAME PERSON WITH SOCRATES LET ANY ONE REFLECT UPON HIMSELF AND CONCLUDE THAT HE HAS IN HIMSELF AN IMMATERIAL SPIRIT
7335-290365-0008 WHICH IS THAT WHICH THINKS IN HIM AND IN THE CONSTANT CHANGE OF HIS BODY KEEPS HIM THE SAME AND IS THAT WHICH HE CALLS HIMSELF LET HIS ALSO SUPPOSE
7335-290365-0009 FOR SOULS BEING AS FAR AS WE KNOW ANYTHING OF THEM IN THEIR NATURE INDIFFERENT TO ANY PARCEL OF MATTER THE SUPPOSITION HAS NO APPARENT ABSURDITY IN IT WHICH IT MAY HAVE BEEN AS WELL AS IT IS NOW THE SOUL OF ANY OTHER MAN
7335-290365-0010 DOES OR CAN HE CONCEIVE HIMSELF THE SAME PERSON WITH EITHER OF THEM CAN HE BE CONCERNED IN EITHER OF THEIR ACTIONS ATTRIBUTE THEM TO HIMSELF OR THINK THEM HIS OWN MORE THAN THE ACTIONS OF ANY OTHER MEN THAT EVER EXISTED
7335-290365-0011 SO THAT THIS CONSCIOUSNESS NOT REACHING TO ANY OF THE ACTIONS OF EITHER OF THOSE MEN HE IS NO MORE ONE SELF WITH EITHER OF THEM THAN OF THE SOUL OF IMMATERIAL SPIRIT THAT NOW INFORMS HIM HAD BEEN CREATED AND BEGAN TO EXIST WHEN IT BEGAN TO INFORM HIS PRESENT BODY
7335-290365-0012 FOR THIS WOULD NO MORE MAKE HIM THE SAME PERSON WITH NESTOR THAN IF SOME OF THE PARTICLES OF SMALLER THAT WERE ONCE A PART OF NESTOR WERE NOW A PART OF THIS MAN THE SAME IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE WITHOUT THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS
7335-290365-0013 NO MORE MAKING THE SAME PERSON BY BEING UNITED TO ANY BODY THAN THE SAME PARTICLE OF MATTER WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS UNITED TO ANY BODY MAKES THE SAME PERSON BUT LET HIM ONCE FIND HIMSELF CONSCIOUS OF ANY OF THE ACTIONS OF NESTOR
7335-290365-0014 HE THEN FINDS HIMSELF THE SAME PERSON WITH NESTOR SEVENTEEN THE BODY AS WELL AS THE SOUL GOES TO THE MAKING OF A MAN AND THUS MAY WE BE ABLE WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY TO CONCEIVE THE SAME PERSON AT THE RESURRECTION
7335-290365-0015 THOUGH IN A BODY NOT EXACTLY IN MAKE OR PARTS THE SAME WHICH HE HAD HERE THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS GOING ALONG WITH THE SOUL THAT INHABITS IT BUT YET THE SOUL ALONE IN THE CHANGE OF BODIES WOULD SCARCE TO ANY ONE BUT TO HIM THAT MAKES THE SOUL THE MAN
7335-290365-0016 BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE SAME MAN FOR SHOULD THE SOUL OF A PRINCE CARRYING WITH IT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PRINCE'S PAST LIFE ENTER AND INFORM THE BODY OF A COBBLER AS SOON AS DESERTED BY HIS OWN SOUL EVERY ONE SEES HE WOULD BE THE SAME PERSON WITH THE PRINCE
7335-290365-0017 ACCOUNTABLE ONLY FOR THE PRINCE'S ACTIONS BUT WHO WOULD SAY IT WAS THE SAME MAN THE BODY TOO GOES TO THE MAKING THE MAN AND WOULD I GUESS TO EVERYBODY DETERMINE THE MAN IN THIS CASE WHEREIN THE SOUL WITH ALL ITS PRINCELY THOUGHTS ABOUT IT WOULD NOT MAKE ANOTHER MAN
7335-290365-0018 BUT HE WOULD BE THE SAME COBBLER TO EVERY ONE BESIDES HIMSELF I KNOW THAT IN THE ORDINARY WAY OF SPEAKING THE SAME PERSON AND THE SAME MAN STAND FOR ONE AND THE SAME THING AND INDEED EVERY ONE WILL ALWAYS HAVE A LIBERTY TO SPEAK AS HE PLEASES
7335-290365-0019 AND TO APPLY WHAT ARTICULATE SOUNDS TO WHAT IDEAS HE THINKS FIT AND CHANGE THEM AS OFTEN AS HE PLEASES BUT YET WHEN WE WILL INQUIRE WHAT MAKES THE SAME SPIRIT MAN OR PERSON WE MUST FIX THE IDEAS OF SPIRIT MAN OR PERSON IN OUR MINDS
7335-290365-0020 AND HAVING RESOLVED WITH OURSELVES WHAT WE MEAN BY THEM IT WILL NOT BE HARD TO DETERMINE IN EITHER OF THEM OR THE LIKE WHEN IT IS THE SAME AND WHEN NOT EIGHTEEN CONSCIOUSNESS ALONE UNITES ACTIONS INTO THE SAME PERSON
7335-290365-0021 BUT THOUGH THE SAME IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE OR SOUL DOES NOT ALONE WHEREVER IT BE AND IN WHATSOEVER STATE MAKE THE SAME MAN YET IT IS PLAIN CONSCIOUSNESS AS FAR AS EVER IT CAN BE EXTENDED SHOULD IT BE TO AGES PAST
7335-290365-0022 UNITES EXISTENCES AND ACTIONS VERY REMOTE IN TIME INTO THE SAME PERSON AS WELL AS IT DOES THE EXISTENCES AND ACTIONS OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING MOMENT SO THAT WHATEVER HAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF PRESENT AND PAST ACTIONS
7335-290365-0023 IS THE SAME PERSON TO WHOM THEY BOTH BELONG HAD I THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I SAW THE ARK AND NOAH'S FLOOD AS THAT I SAW AN OVERFLOWING OF THE THAMES LAST WINTER OR AS THAT I WRITE NOW I COULD NO MORE DOUBT THAT I WHO WRITE THIS NOW
7335-290365-0024 THAT SAW THE THAMES OVERFLOWED LAST WINTER AND THAT VIEWED THE FLOOD AT THE GENERAL DELUGE WAS THE SAME SELF PLACE THAT SELF IN WHAT SUBSTANCE YOU PLEASE THAN THAT I WHO WRITE THIS AM THE SAME MYSELF NOW WHILST I WRITE
7335-290365-0025 WHETHER I CONSIST OF ALL THE SAME SUBSTANCE MATERIAL OR IMMATERIAL OR NO THAT I WAS YESTERDAY FOR AS TO THIS POINT OF BEING THE SAME SELF IT MATTERS NOT WHETHER THIS PRESENT SELF BE MADE UP OF THE SAME OR OTHER SUBSTANCES
7335-290365-0026 I BEING AS MUCH CONCERNED AND AS JUSTLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY ACTION THAT WAS DONE A THOUSAND YEARS SINCE APPROPRIATED TO ME NOW BY THIS SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AS I AM FOR WHAT I DID THE LAST MOMENT NINETEEN
7335-290365-0027 SELF DEPENDS ON CONSCIOUSNESS NOT ON SUBSTANCE SELF IS THAT CONSCIOUS THINKING THING WHATEVER SUBSTANCE MADE UP OF WHETHER SPIRITUAL OR MATERIAL SIMPLE OR COMPOUNDED IT MATTERS NOT
7335-290365-0028 WHICH IS SENSIBLE OR CONSCIOUS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN CAPABLE OF HAPPINESS OR MISERY AND SO IS CONCERNED FOR ITSELF AS FAR AS THAT CONSCIOUSNESS EXTENDS
7335-290365-0029 THUS EVERY ONE FINDS THAT WHILST COMPREHENDED UNDER THAT CONSCIOUSNESS THE LITTLE FINGER IS AS MUCH A PART OF HIMSELF AS WHAT IS MOST SO UPON SEPARATION OF THIS LITTLE FINGER SHOULD THIS CONSCIOUSNESS GO ALONG WITH THE LITTLE FINGER AND LEAVE THE REST OF THE BODY
7335-290365-0030 IT IS EVIDENT THE LITTLE FINGER WOULD BE THE PERSON THE SAME PERSON AND SELF THEN WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE BODY AS IN THIS CASE IT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE SUBSTANCE
7335-290365-0031 WHEN ONE PART IS SEPARATE FROM ANOTHER WHICH MAKES THE SAME PERSON AND CONSTITUTES THIS INSEPARABLE SELF SO IT IS IN REFERENCE TO SUBSTANCES REMOTE IN TIME THAT WITH WHICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS PRESENT THINKING THING CAN JOIN ITSELF
7335-290365-0032 MAKES THE SAME PERSON AND IS ONE SELF WITH IT AND WITH NOTHING ELSE AND SO ATTRIBUTES TO ITSELF AND OWNS ALL THE ACTIONS OF THAT THING AS ITS OWN AS FAR AS THAT CONSCIOUSNESS REACHES AND NO FURTHER AS EVERY ONE WHO REFLECTS WILL PERCEIVE
7335-290365-0033 TWENTY PERSONS NOT SUBSTANCES THE OBJECTS OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT IN THIS PERSONAL IDENTITY IS FOUNDED ALL THE RIGHT AND JUSTICE OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT
7335-290365-0034 HAPPINESS AND MISERY BEING THAT FOR WHICH EVERY ONE IS CONCERNED FOR HIMSELF AND NOT MATTERING WHAT BECOMES OF ANY SUBSTANCE NOT JOINED TO OR AFFECTED WITH THAT CONSCIOUSNESS FOR AS IT IS EVIDENT IN THE INSTANCE I GAVE BUT NOW
7335-290365-0035 IF THE CONSCIOUSNESS WENT ALONG WITH THE LITTLE FINGER WHEN IT WAS CUT OFF THAT WOULD BE THE SAME SELF WHICH WAS CONCERNED FOR THE WHOLE BODY YESTERDAY AS MAKING PART OF ITSELF WHOSE ACTIONS THEN IT CANNOT BUT ADMIT AS ITS OWN NOW
7335-290365-0036 THOUGH IF THE SAME BODY SHOULD STILL LIVE AND IMMEDIATELY FROM THE SEPARATION OF THE LITTLE FINGER HAVE ITS OWN PECULIAR CONSCIOUSNESS WHEREOF THE LITTLE FINGER KNEW NOTHING IT WOULD NOT AT ALL BE CONCERNED FOR IT AS A PART OF ITSELF
7335-290365-0037 OR COULD OWN ANY OF ITS ACTIONS OR HAVE ANY OF THEM IMPUTED TO HIM TWENTY ONE WHICH SHOWS WHEREIN PERSONAL IDENTITY CONSISTS
7335-290365-0038 THIS MAY SHOW US WHEREIN PERSONAL IDENTITY CONSISTS NOT IN THE IDENTITY OF SUBSTANCE BUT AS I HAVE SAID IN THE IDENTITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHEREIN IF SOCRATES AND THE PRESENT MAYOR OF QUEENBOROUGH AGREE THEY ARE THE SAME PERSON
7335-290365-0039 IF THE SAME SOCRATES WAKING AND SLEEPING DO NOT PARTAKE OF THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS SOCRATES WAKING AND SLEEPING IS NOT THE SAME PERSON AND TO PUNISH SOCRATES WAKING FOR WHAT SLEEPING SOCRATES THOUGHT AND WAKING SOCRATES WAS NEVER CONSCIOUS OF
7335-290365-0040 WOULD BE NO MORE OF RIGHT THAN TO PUNISH ONE TWIN FOR WHAT HIS BROTHER TWIN DID WHEREOF HE KNEW NOTHING BECAUSE THEIR OUTSIDES WERE SO LIKE THAT THEY COULD NOT BE DISTINGUISHED FOR SUCH TWINS HAVE BEEN SEEN
7335-290365-0041 TWENTY TWO ABSOLUTE OBLIVION SEPARATES WHAT IS THUS FORGOTTEN FROM THE PERSON BUT NOT FROM THE MAN BUT YET POSSIBLY IT WILL STILL BE OBJECTED
7335-290365-0042 SUPPOSE I WHOLLY LOSE THE MEMORY OF SOME PARTS OF MY LIFE BEYOND A POSSIBILITY OF RETRIEVING THEM SO THAT PERHAPS I SHALL NEVER BE CONSCIOUS OF THEM AGAIN YET AM I NOT THE SAME PERSON THAT DID THOSE ACTIONS HAD THOSE THOUGHTS THAT I ONCE WAS CONSCIOUS OF
7335-290365-0043 THOUGH I HAVE NOW FORGOT THEM TO WHICH I ANSWER THAT WE MUST HERE TAKE NOTICE WHAT THE WORD I IS APPLIED TO WHICH IN THIS CASE IS THE MAN ONLY AND THE SAME MAN BEING PRESUMED TO BE THE SAME PERSON
7335-290365-0044 I IS EASILY HERE SUPPOSED TO STAND ALSO FOR THE SAME PERSON BUT IF IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE SAME MAN TO HAVE DISTINCT INCOMMUNICABLE CONSCIOUSNESS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IT IS PAST DOUBT THE SAME MAN WOULD AT DIFFERENT TIMES MAKE DIFFERENT PERSONS
7335-290365-0045 WHICH WE SEE IS THE SENSE OF MANKIND IN THE SOLEMNEST DECLARATION OF THEIR OPINIONS HUMAN LAWS NOT PUNISHING THE MAD MAN FOR THE SOBER MAN'S ACTIONS NOR THE SOBER MAN FOR WHAT THE MAD MAN DID THEREBY MAKING THEM TWO PERSONS
7335-290365-0046 WHICH IS SOMEWHAT EXPLAINED BY OUR WAY OF SPEAKING IN ENGLISH WHEN WE SAY SUCH AN ONE IS NOT HIMSELF OR IS BESIDE HIMSELF IN WHICH PHRASES IT IS INSINUATED AS IF THOSE WHO NOW OR AT LEAST FIRST USED THEM THOUGHT THAT SELF WAS CHANGED
7335-290365-0047 TO HELP US A LITTLE IN THIS WE MUST CONSIDER WHAT IS MEANT BY SOCRATES OR THE SAME INDIVIDUAL MAN FIRST IT MUST BE EITHER THE SAME INDIVIDUAL IMMATERIAL THINKING SUBSTANCE IN SHORT THE SAME NUMERICAL SOUL AND NOTHING ELSE
7335-290365-0048 SECONDLY OR THE SAME ANIMAL WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO AN IMMATERIAL SOUL THIRDLY OR THE SAME IMMATERIAL SPIRIT UNITED TO THE SAME ANIMAL
7335-290365-0049 NOW TAKE WHICH OF THESE SUPPOSITIONS YOU PLEASE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE PERSONAL IDENTITY TO CONSIST IN ANYTHING BUT CONSCIOUSNESS OR REACH ANY FURTHER THAN THAT DOES
7335-290365-0050 FOR BY THE FIRST OF THEM IT MUST BE ALLOWED POSSIBLE THAT A MAN BORN OF DIFFERENT WOMEN AND IN DISTANT TIMES MAY BE THE SAME MAN A WAY OF SPEAKING WHICH WHOEVER ADMITS MUST ALLOW IT POSSIBLE FOR THE SAME MAN TO BE TWO DISTINCT PERSONS
7335-290365-0051 AS ANY TWO THAT HAVE LIVED IN DIFFERENT AGES WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF ONE ANOTHER'S THOUGHTS BY THE SECOND AND THIRD SOCRATES IN THIS LIFE AND AFTER IT CANNOT BE THE SAME MAN ANY WAY BUT BY THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS
7335-290365-0052 AND SO MAKING HUMAN IDENTITY TO CONSIST IN THE SAME THING WHEREIN WE PLACE PERSONAL IDENTITY THERE WILL BE DIFFICULTY TO ALLOW THE SAME MAN TO BE THE SAME PERSON BUT THEN THEY WHO PLACE HUMAN IDENTITY IN CONSCIOUSNESS ONLY AND NOT IN SOMETHING ELSE
7335-290365-0053 MUST CONSIDER HOW THEY WILL MAKE THE INFANT SOCRATES THE SAME MAN WITH SOCRATES AFTER THE RESURRECTION BUT WHATSOEVER TO SOME MEN MAKES A MAN AND CONSEQUENTLY THE SAME INDIVIDUAL MAN WHEREIN PERHAPS FEW ARE AGREED
7335-290365-0054 PERSONAL IDENTITY CAN BY US BE PLACED IN NOTHING BUT CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS THAT ALONE WHICH MAKES WHAT WE CALL SELF WITHOUT INVOLVING US IN GREAT ABSURDITIES TWENTY FOUR BUT IS NOT A MAN DRUNK AND SOBER THE SAME PERSON
7335-290365-0055 WHY ELSE IS HE PUNISHED FOR THE FACT HE COMMITS WHEN DRUNK THOUGH HE BE NEVER AFTERWARDS CONSCIOUS OF IT JUST AS MUCH THE SAME PERSON AS A MAN THAT WALKS AND DOES OTHER THINGS IN HIS SLEEP IS THE SAME PERSON AND IS ANSWERABLE FOR ANY MISCHIEF HE SHALL DO IN IT
7335-290365-0056 HUMAN LAWS PUNISH BOTH WITH A JUSTICE SUITABLE TO THEIR WAY OF KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE IN THESE CASES THEY CANNOT DISTINGUISH CERTAINLY WHAT IS REAL WHAT COUNTERFEIT AND SO THE IGNORANCE IN DRUNKENNESS OR SLEEP IS NOT ADMITTED AS A PLEA
7335-290365-0057 BUT IN THE GREAT DAY WHEREIN THE SECRETS OF ALL HEARTS SHALL BE LAID OPEN IT MAY BE REASONABLE TO THINK NO ONE SHALL BE MADE TO ANSWER FOR WHAT HE KNOWS NOTHING OF BUT SHALL RECEIVE HIS DOOM HIS CONSCIENCE ACCUSING OR EXCUSING HIM TWENTY FIVE
7335-290365-0058 CONSCIOUSNESS ALONE UNITES REMOTE EXISTENCES INTO ONE PERSON NOTHING BUT CONSCIOUSNESS CAN UNITE REMOTE EXISTENCES INTO THE SAME PERSON THE IDENTITY OF SUBSTANCE WILL NOT DO IT
7335-290365-0059 FOR WHATEVER SUBSTANCE THERE IS HOWEVER FRAMED WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS THERE IS NO PERSON AND A CARCASS MAY BE A PERSON AS WELL AS ANY SORT OF SUBSTANCE BE SO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS COULD WE SUPPOSE TWO DISTINCT INCOMMUNICABLE CONSCIOUSNESSES
7335-290365-0060 ACTING THE SAME BODY THE ONE CONSTANTLY BY DAY THE OTHER BY NIGHT AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS ACTING BY INTERVALS TWO DISTINCT BODIES I ASK IN THE FIRST CASE WHETHER THE DAY AND THE NIGHT
7335-290365-0061 MAN WOULD NOT BE TWO AS DISTINCT PERSONS AS SOCRATES AND PLATO AND WHETHER IN THE SECOND CASE THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE PERSON IN TWO DISTINCT BODIES AS MUCH AS ONE MAN IS THE SAME IN TWO DISTINCT CLOTHINGS
7335-290365-0062 NOR IS IT AT ALL MATERIAL TO SAY THAT THIS SAME AND THIS DISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE CASES ABOVE MENTIONED IS OWING TO THE SAME AND DISTINCT IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCES BRINGING IT WITH THEM TO THOSE BODIES WHICH WHETHER TRUE OR NO ALTERS NOT THE CASE
7335-290365-0063 SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THE PERSONAL IDENTITY WOULD EQUALLY BE DETERMINED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS WHETHER THAT CONSCIOUSNESS WERE ANNEXED TO SOME INDIVIDUAL IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE OR NO FOR GRANTING THAT THE THINKING SUBSTANCE IN MAN MUST BE NECESSARILY SUPPOSED IMMATERIAL
7335-290365-0064 IT IS EVIDENT THAT IMMATERIAL THINKING THING MAY SOMETIMES PART WITH ITS PAST CONSCIOUSNESS AND BE RESTORED TO IT AGAIN AS APPEARS IN THE FORGETFULNESS MEN OFTEN HAVE OF THEIR PAST ACTIONS AND THE MIND MANY TIMES RECOVERS THE MEMORY OF A PAST CONSCIOUSNESS
7335-290365-0065 WHICH IT HAD LOST FOR TWENTY YEARS TOGETHER MAKE THESE INTERVALS OF MEMORY AND FORGETFULNESS TO TAKE THEIR TURNS REGULARLY BY DAY AND NIGHT AND YOU HAVE TWO PERSONS WITH THE SAME IMMATERIAL SPIRIT AS MUCH AS IN THE FORMER INSTANCE TWO PERSONS WITH THE SAME BODY
7335-290365-0066 SO THAT SELF IS NOT DETERMINED BY IDENTITY OR DIVERSITY OF SUBSTANCE WHICH IT CANNOT BE SURE OF BUT ONLY BY IDENTITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS TWENTY SIX NOT THE SUBSTANCE WITH WHICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS MAY BE UNITED
7335-290365-0067 INDEED IT MAY CONCEIVE THE SUBSTANCE WHEREOF IT IS NOW MADE UP TO HAVE EXISTED FORMERLY UNITED IN THE SAME CONSCIOUS BEING BUT CONSCIOUSNESS REMOVED THAT SUBSTANCE IS NO MORE ITSELF OR MAKES NO MORE A PART OF IT THAN ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE
7335-290365-0068 AS IS EVIDENT IN THE INSTANCE WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN OF A LIMB CUT OFF OF WHOSE HEAT OR COLD OR OTHER AFFECTIONS HAVING NO LONGER ANY CONSCIOUSNESS IT IS NO MORE OF A MAN'S SELF THAN ANY OTHER MATTER OF THE UNIVERSE
7335-290365-0069 IN LIKE MANNER IT WILL BE IN REFERENCE TO ANY IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE WHICH IS VOID OF THAT CONSCIOUSNESS WHEREBY I AM MYSELF TO MYSELF SO THAT I CANNOT UPON RECOLLECTION JOIN WITH THAT PRESENT CONSCIOUSNESS WHEREBY I AM NOW MYSELF
7335-290365-0070 IT IS IN THAT PART OF ITS EXISTENCE NO MORE MYSELF THAN ANY OTHER IMMATERIAL BEING FOR WHATSOEVER ANY SUBSTANCE HAS THOUGHT OR DONE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT AND BY MY CONSCIOUSNESS MAKE MY OWN THOUGHT AND ACTION IT WILL NO MORE BELONG TO ME
7335-290365-0071 WHETHER A PART OF ME THOUGHT OR DID IT THAN IF IT HAD BEEN THOUGHT OR DONE BY ANY OTHER IMMATERIAL BEING ANYWHERE EXISTING TWENTY SEVEN CONSCIOUSNESS UNITES SUBSTANCES MATERIAL OR SPIRITUAL WITH THE SAME PERSONALITY
7335-290365-0072 I AGREE THE MORE PROBABLE OPINION IS THAT THIS CONSCIOUSNESS IS ANNEXED TO AND THE AFFECTION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE BUT LET MEN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIVERSE HYPOTHESES RESOLVE OF THAT AS THEY PLEASE
7335-290365-0073 THIS EVERY INTELLIGENT BEING SENSIBLE OF HAPPINESS OR MISERY MUST GRANT THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS HIMSELF THAT HE IS CONCERNED FOR AND WOULD HAVE HAPPY THAT THIS SELF HAS EXISTED IN A CONTINUED DURATION MORE THAN ONE INSTANT
7335-290365-0074 AND THEREFORE IT IS POSSIBLE MAY EXIST AS IT HAS DONE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME WITHOUT ANY CERTAIN BOUNDS TO BE SET TO ITS DURATION AND MAY BE THE SAME SELF BY THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS CONTINUED ON FOR THE FUTURE
7335-290365-0075 AND THUS BY THIS CONSCIOUSNESS HE FINDS HIMSELF TO BE THE SAME SELF WHICH DID SUCH AND SUCH AN ACTION SOME YEARS SINCE BY WHICH HE COMES TO BE HAPPY OR MISERABLE NOW IN ALL WHICH ACCOUNT OF SELF THE SAME NUMERICAL SUBSTANCE IS NOT CONSIDERED A MAKING THE SAME SELF
7335-290365-0076 BUT THE SAME CONTINUED CONSCIOUSNESS IN WHICH SEVERAL SUBSTANCES MAY HAVE BEEN UNITED AND AGAIN SEPARATED FROM IT WHICH WHILST THEY CONTINUED IN A VITAL UNION WITH THAT WHEREIN THIS CONSCIOUSNESS THEN RESIDED MADE A PART OF THAT SAME SELF
7335-290365-0077 THUS ANY PART OF OUR BODIES VITALLY UNITED TO THAT WHICH IS CONSCIOUS IN US MAKES A PART OF OURSELVES BUT UPON SEPARATION FROM THE VITAL UNION BY WHICH THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS COMMUNICATED THAT WHICH A MOMENT SINCE WAS PART OF OURSELVES
7335-290365-0078 IS NOW NO MORE SO THAN A PART OF ANOTHER MAN'S SELF IS A PART OF ME AND IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IN A LITTLE TIME MAY BECOME A REAL PART OF ANOTHER PERSON AND SO WE HAVE THE SAME NUMERICAL SUBSTANCE BECOME A PART OF TWO DIFFERENT PERSONS
7335-290365-0079 AND THE SAME PERSON PRESERVED UNDER THE CHANGE OF VARIOUS SUBSTANCES COULD WE SUPPOSE ANY SPIRIT WHOLLY STRIPPED OF ALL ITS MEMORY OF CONSCIOUSNESS OF PAST ACTIONS AS WE FIND OUR MINDS ALWAYS ARE OF A GREAT PART OF OURS AND SOMETIMES OF THEM ALL
7335-290365-0080 THE UNION OR SEPARATION OF SUCH A SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE WOULD MAKE NO VARIATION OF PERSONAL IDENTITY ANY MORE THAN THAT OF ANY PARTICLE OF MATTER DOES ANY SUBSTANCE VITALLY UNITED TO THE PRESENT THINKING BEING
7335-290365-0081 IS A PART OF THAT VERY SAME SELF WHICH NOW IS ANYTHING UNITED TO IT BY A CONSCIOUSNESS OF FORMER ACTIONS MAKES ALSO A PART OF THE SAME SELF WHICH IS THE SAME BOTH THEN AND NOW TWENTY EIGHT
7335-290365-0082 PERSON A FORENSIC TERM PERSON AS I TAKE IT IS THE NAME FOR THIS SELF WHEREVER A MAN FINDS WHAT HE CALLS HIMSELF THERE I THINK ANOTHER MAY SAY IS THE SAME PERSON IT IS A FORENSIC TERM APPROPRIATING ACTIONS AND THEIR MERIT
7335-290365-0083 AND SO BELONGS ONLY TO INTELLIGENT AGENTS CAPABLE OF A LAW AND HAPPINESS AND MISERY THIS PERSONALITY EXTENDS ITSELF BEYOND PRESENT EXISTENCE TO WHAT IS PAST ONLY BY CONSCIOUSNESS
7335-290365-0084 WHEREBY IT BECOMES CONCERNED AND ACCOUNTABLE OWNS AND IMPUTES TO ITSELF PAST ACTIONS JUST UPON THE SAME GROUND AND FOR THE SAME REASON AS IT DOES THE PRESENT ALL WHICH IS FOUNDED IN A CONCERN FOR HAPPINESS
7335-290365-0085 THE UNAVOIDABLE CONCOMITANT OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WHICH IS CONSCIOUS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN DESIRING THAT THAT SELF THAT IS CONSCIOUS SHOULD BE HAPPY AND THEREFORE WHATEVER PAST ACTIONS IT CANNOT RECONCILE OR APPROPRIATE TO THAT PRESENT SELF BY CONSCIOUSNESS
7335-290365-0086 ON THE ACCOUNT OF ANY SUCH ACTION IS ALL ONE AS TO BE MADE HAPPY OR MISERABLE IN ITS FIRST BEING WITHOUT ANY DEMERIT AT ALL FOR SUPPOSING A MAN PUNISHED NOW FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE IN ANOTHER LIFE WHEREOF HE COULD BE MADE TO HAVE NO CONSCIOUSNESS AT ALL
7335-290365-0087 WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN THAT PUNISHMENT AND BEING CREATED MISERABLE AND THEREFORE CONFORMABLE TO THIS THE APOSTLE TELLS US THAT AT THE GREAT DAY WHEN EVERY ONE SHALL RECEIVE ACCORDING TO HIS DOINGS THE SECRETS OF ALL HEARTS SHALL BE LAID OPEN
7335-290365-0088 ARE THE SAME THAT COMMITTED THOSE ACTIONS AND DESERVE THAT PUNISHMENT FOR THEM TWENTY NINE SUPPOSITIONS THAT LOOK STRANGE ARE PARDONABLE IN OUR IGNORANCE
7335-290365-0089 I AM APT ENOUGH TO THINK I HAVE IN TREATING OF THIS SUBJECT MADE SOME SUPPOSITIONS THAT WILL LOOK STRANGE TO SOME READERS AND POSSIBLY THEY ARE SO IN THEMSELVES BUT YET I THINK THEY ARE SUCH AS ARE PARDONABLE
7335-290365-0090 AND WHICH WE LOOK ON AS OURSELVES DID WE KNOW WHAT IT WAS OR HOW IT WAS TIED TO A CERTAIN SYSTEM OF FLEETING ANIMAL SPIRITS OR WHETHER IT COULD OR COULD NOT PERFORM ITS OPERATIONS OF THINKING
7335-290365-0091 AND MEMORY OUT OF A BODY ORGANIZED AS OURS IS AND WHETHER IT HAS PLEASED GOD THAT NO ONE SUCH SPIRIT SHALL EVER BE UNITED TO ANY BUT ONE SUCH BODY UPON THE RIGHT CONSTITUTION OF WHOSE ORGANS ITS MEMORY SHOULD DEPEND
7335-290365-0092 WE MIGHT SEE THE ABSURDITY OF SOME OF THOSE SUPPOSITIONS I HAVE MADE BUT TAKING AS WE ORDINARILY NOW DO IN THE DARK CONCERNING THESE MATTERS THE SOUL OF A MAN FOR AN IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE INDEPENDENT FROM MATTER AND INDIFFERENT ALIKE TO IT ALL
7335-290365-0093 THERE CAN FROM THE NATURE OF THINGS BE NO ABSURDITY AT ALL TO SUPPOSE THAT THE SAME SOUL MAY AT DIFFERENT TIMES BE UNITED TO DIFFERENT BODIES AND WITH THEM MAKE UP FOR THAT TIME ONE MAN AS WELL AS WE SUPPOSE A PART OF A SHEEP'S BODY YESTERDAY
7335-290365-0094 SHOULD BE A PART OF A MAN'S BODY TO MORROW AND IN THAT UNION MAKE A VITAL PART OF MELIBOEUS HIMSELF AS WELL AS IT DID OF HIS RAM THIRTY THE DIFFICULTY FROM ILL USE OF NAMES TO CONCLUDE
7335-290365-0095 WHATEVER SUBSTANCE BEGINS TO EXIST IT MUST DURING ITS EXISTENCE NECESSARILY BE THE SAME WHATEVER COMPOSITIONS OF SUBSTANCES BEGIN TO EXIST DURING THE UNION OF THOSE SUBSTANCES THE CONCRETE MUST BE THE SAME
7335-290365-0096 AND SO IF THE COMPOSITION BE OF DISTINCT SUBSTANCES AND DIFFERENT MODES THE SAME RULE HOLDS WHEREBY IT WILL APPEAR THAT THE DIFFICULTY OR OBSCURITY THAT HAS BEEN ABOUT THIS MATTER RATHER RISES FROM THE NAMES ILL USED
7335-290365-0097 THAN FROM ANY OBSCURITY IN THINGS THEMSELVES FOR WHATEVER MAKES THE SPECIFIC IDEA TO WHICH THE NAME IS APPLIED IF THAT IDEA BE STEADILY KEPT TO THE DISTINCTION OF ANYTHING INTO THE SAME AND DIVERS WILL EASILY BE CONCEIVED AND THERE CAN ARISE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
7335-290365-0098 THIRTY ONE CONTINUANCE OF THAT WHICH WE HAVE MADE TO BE OUR COMPLEX IDEA OF MAN MAKES THE SAME MAN FOR SUPPOSING A RATIONAL SPIRIT BE THE IDEA OF A MAN IT IS EASY TO KNOW WHAT IS THE SAME MAN VIZ THE SAME SPIRIT
7335-290365-0099 WHETHER SEPARATE OR IN A BODY WILL BE THE SAME MAN SUPPOSING A RATIONAL SPIRIT VITALLY UNITED TO A BODY OF A CERTAIN CONFORMATION OF PARTS TO MAKE A MAN WHILST THAT RATIONAL SPIRIT WITH THAT VITAL CONFORMATION OF PARTS
7335-290365-0100 THOUGH CONTINUED IN A FLEETING SUCCESSIVE BODY REMAINS IT WILL BE THE SAME MAN BUT IF TO ANY ONE THE IDEA OF A MAN BE BUT THE VITAL UNION OF PARTS IN A CERTAIN SHAPE AS LONG AS THAT VITAL UNION AND SHAPE REMAIN IN A CONCRETE
7335-290365-0101 NO OTHERWISE THE SAME BUT BY A CONTINUED SUCCESSION OF FLEETING PARTICLES IT WILL BE THE SAME MAN
