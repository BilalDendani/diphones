705-157959-0000 THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS IN A STATE OF ALARM AND COMMOTION NATASHA WAS VERY ILL
705-157959-0001 POISONED HERSELF THE NIGHT AFTER SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT ANATOLE WAS MARRIED WITH SOME ARSENIC SHE HAD STEALTHILY PROCURED AFTER SWALLOWING A LITTLE SHE HAD BEEN SO FRIGHTENED
705-157959-0002 THAT SHE WOKE SONYA AND TOLD HER WHAT SHE HAD DONE THE NECESSARY ANTIDOTES HAD BEEN ADMINISTERED IN TIME AND SHE WAS NOW OUT OF DANGER THOUGH STILL SO WEAK
705-157959-0003 THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO MOVE HER TO THE COUNTRY AND SO THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN SENT FOR PIERRE SAW THE DISTRACTED COUNT AND SONYA WHO HAD A TEAR STAINED FACE BUT HE COULD NOT SEE NATASHA
705-157959-0004 ASSURING EVERYONE THAT NOTHING HAD HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT HIS BROTHER IN LAW HAD PROPOSED TO HER AND BEEN REFUSED IT SEEMED TO PIERRE THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO CONCEAL THE WHOLE AFFAIR
705-157959-0005 WITH GREAT IMPATIENCE SOME DAYS AFTER ANATOLE'S DEPARTURE PIERRE RECEIVED A NOTE FROM PRINCE ANDREW INFORMING HIM OF HIS ARRIVAL AND ASKING HIM TO COME TO SEE HIM
705-157959-0006 BREAKING OFF HER ENGAGEMENT MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE HAD PURLOINED IT FROM PRINCESS MARY AND GIVEN IT TO THE OLD PRINCE AND HE HEARD FROM HIM THE STORY OF NATASHA'S ELOPEMENT
705-157959-0007 PRINCE ANDREW HAD ARRIVED IN THE EVENING AND PIERRE CAME TO SEE HIM NEXT MORNING PIERRE EXPECTED TO FIND PRINCE ANDREW IN ALMOST THE SAME STATE AS NATASHA
705-157959-0008 AND WAS THEREFORE SURPRISED ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM TO HEAR HIM IN THE STUDY TALKING IN A LOUD ANIMATED VOICE ABOUT SOME INTRIGUE GOING ON IN PETERSBURG
705-157959-0009 THE OLD PRINCE'S VOICE AND ANOTHER NOW AND THEN INTERRUPTED HIM PRINCESS MARY CAME OUT TO MEET PIERRE SHE SIGHED LOOKING TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WHERE PRINCE ANDREW WAS
705-157959-0010 EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO EXPRESS HER SYMPATHY WITH HIS SORROW BUT PIERRE SAW BY HER FACE THAT SHE WAS GLAD BOTH AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
705-157959-0011 AND AT THE WAY HER BROTHER HAD TAKEN THE NEWS OF NATASHA'S FAITHLESSNESS HE SAYS HE EXPECTED IT SHE REMARKED I KNOW HIS PRIDE WILL NOT LET HIM EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS BUT
705-157959-0012 HE HAS TAKEN IT BETTER FAR BETTER THAN I EXPECTED EVIDENTLY IT HAD TO BE BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL IS REALLY ENDED ASKED PIERRE PRINCESS MARY LOOKED AT HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
705-157959-0013 BUT WITH A FRESH HORIZONTAL WRINKLE BETWEEN HIS BROWS STOOD IN CIVILIAN DRESS FACING HIS FATHER AND PRINCE
705-157959-0014 WARMLY DISPUTING AND VIGOROUSLY GESTICULATING THE CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT SPERANSKI THE NEWS OF WHOSE SUDDEN EXILE AND ALLEGED TREACHERY HAD JUST REACHED MOSCOW
705-157959-0015 AND BY THOSE WHO WERE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HIS AIMS TO JUDGE A MAN WHO IS IN DISFAVOR
705-157959-0016 BUT I MAINTAIN THAT IF ANYTHING GOOD HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THIS REIGN IT WAS DONE BY HIM BY HIM ALONE HE PAUSED AT THE SIGHT OF PIERRE HIS FACE QUIVERED
705-157959-0017 AND IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED A VINDICTIVE EXPRESSION POSTERITY WILL DO HIM JUSTICE HE CONCLUDED AND AT ONCE TURNED TO PIERRE WELL
705-157959-0018 STILL GETTING STOUTER HE SAID WITH ANIMATION BUT THE NEW WRINKLE ON HIS FOREHEAD DEEPENED YES I AM WELL HE SAID IN ANSWER TO PIERRE'S QUESTION AND SMILED
705-157959-0019 TO PIERRE THAT SMILE SAID PLAINLY I AM WELL
705-157959-0020 AFTER A FEW WORDS TO PIERRE ABOUT THE AWFUL ROADS FROM THE POLISH FRONTIER ABOUT PEOPLE HE HAD MET IN SWITZERLAND WHO KNEW PIERRE
705-157959-0021 WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT FROM ABROAD TO BE HIS SON'S TUTOR PRINCE ANDREW AGAIN JOINED WARMLY IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT SPERANSKI WHICH WAS STILL GOING ON BETWEEN THE TWO OLD MEN
705-157959-0022 IF THERE WERE TREASON OR PROOFS OF SECRET RELATIONS WITH NAPOLEON THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC HE SAID WITH WARMTH AND HASTE I DO NOT AND NEVER DID LIKE SPERANSKI PERSONALLY
705-157959-0023 BUT I LIKE JUSTICE PIERRE NOW RECOGNIZED IN HIS FRIEND A NEED WITH WHICH HE WAS ONLY TOO FAMILIAR TO GET EXCITED AND TO HAVE ARGUMENTS ABOUT EXTRANEOUS MATTERS
705-157959-0024 IN ORDER TO STIFLE THOUGHTS THAT WERE TOO OPPRESSIVE AND TOO INTIMATE WHEN PRINCE MESHCHERSKI HAD LEFT PRINCE ANDREW TOOK PIERRE'S ARM AND ASKED HIM INTO THE ROOM THAT HAD BEEN ASSIGNED HIM
705-157959-0025 A BED HAD BEEN MADE UP THERE AND SOME OPEN PORTMANTEAUS AND TRUNKS STOOD ABOUT PRINCE ANDREW WENT TO ONE AND TOOK OUT A SMALL CASKET FROM WHICH HE DREW A PACKET WRAPPED IN PAPER
705-157959-0026 HE DID IT ALL SILENTLY AND VERY QUICKLY HE STOOD UP AND COUGHED HIS FACE WAS GLOOMY AND HIS LIPS COMPRESSED FORGIVE ME FOR TROUBLING YOU
705-157959-0027 PIERRE SAW THAT PRINCE ANDREW WAS GOING TO SPEAK OF NATASHA AND HIS BROAD FACE EXPRESSED PITY AND SYMPATHY THIS EXPRESSION IRRITATED PRINCE ANDREW

705-157959-0032 MONSIEUR KURAGIN HAS NOT HONORED COUNTESS ROSTOVA WITH HIS HAND SAID PRINCE ANDREW AND HE SNORTED SEVERAL TIMES
705-157959-0033 PRINCE ANDREW LAUGHED DISAGREEABLY AGAIN REMINDING ONE OF HIS FATHER AND WHERE IS YOUR BROTHER IN LAW NOW IF I MAY ASK HE SAID
705-157959-0034 BUT I DON'T KNOW SAID PIERRE WELL IT DOESN'T MATTER SAID PRINCE ANDREW TELL COUNTESS ROSTOVA THAT SHE WAS AND IS PERFECTLY FREE
705-157959-0035 PIERRE TOOK THE PACKET PRINCE ANDREW AS IF TRYING TO REMEMBER WHETHER HE HAD SOMETHING MORE TO SAY OR WAITING TO SEE IF PIERRE WOULD SAY ANYTHING LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIM
705-157959-0036 I SAY DO YOU REMEMBER OUR DISCUSSION IN PETERSBURG ASKED PIERRE ABOUT
705-157959-0037 I SAID THAT A FALLEN WOMAN SHOULD BE FORGIVEN

705-157959-0039 YES THAT WOULD BE VERY NOBLE BUT I AM UNABLE TO FOLLOW IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FOOTSTEPS IF YOU WISH TO BE MY FRIEND NEVER SPEAK TO ME OF THAT
705-157959-0040 WELL GOOD BY SO YOU'LL GIVE HER THE PACKET PIERRE LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT TO THE OLD PRINCE AND PRINCESS MARY THE OLD MAN SEEMED LIVELIER THAN USUAL
705-157959-0041 PRINCESS MARY WAS THE SAME AS ALWAYS BUT BENEATH HER SYMPATHY FOR HER BROTHER PIERRE NOTICED HER SATISFACTION THAT THE ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF LOOKING AT THEM PIERRE REALIZED
