1845-145083-0005 A HORRIBLE THING TO HAPPEN IN A MAN'S HOME DUNDEE MILES WAS SAYING HIS PLUMP ROSY FACE BLIGHTED WITH HORROR I CAN'T REALIZE YET THAT WE ACTUALLY SLEPT AS USUAL WITH A CORPSE LYING DOWN HERE ALL NIGHT AND I HAVE ONLY MYSELF TO BLAME
1845-145083-0006 WHAT DO YOU MEAN DUNDEE ASKED WHY THAT THE THE BODY WASN'T DISCOVERED SOONER MILES EXPLAINED IF IT HAD OCCURRED TO ME THAT WHITSON HADN'T CLOSED THE TROPHY ROOM WINDOWS I SHOULD HAVE GONE IN TO CLOSE AND LOCK THEM WHEN I MADE THE ROUNDS OF LIVING ROOM
1845-145083-0007 DINING ROOM AND LIBRARY AFTER OUR GUESTS WERE GONE LAST NIGHT A PALE FACED BALD HEADED BUTLER HAD MATERIALIZED WHILE HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING BEG PARDON SIR

1845-145083-0009 EXCEPT SPRAGUE OF COURSE AND I HAD NO IDEA HE'D GONE THERE DRAKE WANTED TO PLAY ANAGRAMS AND BEFORE THE BRIDGE GAME STARTED I WENT TO THE TROPHY ROOM TO GET THE BOX MILES EXPLAINED I TURNED OFF THE LIGHT WHEN I LEFT
1845-145083-0010 AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT BURNING IN THERE THIS MORNING WHEN CELIA THE PARLOR MAID WENT THERE TO PUT THE ANAGRAM BOX BACK IN THE CABINET AND FOUND THE BODY FLORA MISSUS MILES HAD BROUGHT THE ANAGRAMS IN FROM THE PORCH AND LEFT THEM ON A TABLE IN THE LIVING ROOM
1845-145083-0011 AS OUR GUESTS WERE GETTING READY TO LEAVE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BRING IN IN CASE OF RAIN THE BRIDGE TABLES ARE OF IRON COVERED WITH OILCLOTH AND FITTED WITH OILCLOTH BAGS FOR THE CARDS SCORE PADS AND PENCILS YES I KNOW DUNDEE INTERRUPTED
1845-145083-0012 MISS CRAIN HAS ALREADY TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THAT AND A GOOD MANY DETAILS OF THE PARTY ITSELF BY THE WAY WHERE IS MISSUS MILES NOW IN BED THE DOCTOR IS WITH HER SHE IS PROSTRATED FROM THE SHOCK
1845-145083-0013 NO DON'T BOTHER TO COME WITH ME JUST POINT IT OUT IT'S ON THIS FLOOR I UNDERSTAND MILES POINTED PAST THE GREAT CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT WOUND UPWARD FROM THE MAIN HALL YOU CAN'T SEE THE DOOR FROM HERE BUT IT'S BEHIND THE STAIRCASE
1845-145083-0014 CELIA FOUND THE DOOR CLOSED THIS MORNING AND NO LIGHT ON AS I SAID DUNDEE CUT HIM SHORT BY MARCHING TOWARD THE DOOR WHICH WAS AGAIN CLOSED HE ENTERED SO NOISELESSLY THAT CAPTAIN STRAWN DOCTOR PRICE AND THE FINGERPRINT EXPERT CARRAWAY DID NOT HEAR HIM
1845-145083-0015 FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD JUST INSIDE THE DOOR AND LET HIS EYES WANDER ABOUT THE ROOM WHICH PENNY CRAIN HAD ALREADY DESCRIBED IT WAS NOT A LARGE ROOM TWELVE BY FOURTEEN FEET POSSIBLY BUT IT LOOKED EVEN SMALLER CROWDED AS IT WAS WITH THE LONG PING PONG TABLE
1845-145083-0016 BAGS OF GOLF CLUBS FISHING TACKLE TENNIS RACQUETS SKIS AND SLEDS THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS IN THE NORTH WALL OF THE ROOM LOOKING OUT UPON THE YEW HEDGED DRIVEWAY AND BETWEEN THEM STOOD A CABINET OF NUMEROUS BIG AND LITTLE DRAWERS
1845-145083-0017 A POOL OF WHICH HAD FORMED AND THEN HALF CONGEALED UPON THE RUG THE RIGHT HAND THE FINGERS CURLED BUT NOT TOUCHING EACH OTHER LAY PALM UPWARD ON THE FLOOR AT THE END OF THE RIGID OUTSTRETCHED ARM THE ONE VISIBLE EYE WAS HALF OPEN
1845-145083-0018 BUT ON THE SALLOW THIN FACE WHICH HAD BEEN STRIKINGLY HANDSOME IN AN OBVIOUS SORT OF WAY WAS A PEACE AND DIGNITY WHICH DUNDEE HAD NEVER SEEN UPON SPRAGUE'S FACE WHEN THE MAN WAS ALIVE THE LEFT LEG WAS DRAWN UPWARD SO THAT THE KNEE ALMOST TOUCHED THE BULLET PIERCED STOMACH
1845-145083-0019 HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DEAD DOCTOR DUNDEE ASKED QUIETLY HELLO BOY DOCTOR PRICE GREETED HIM PLACIDLY ALWAYS THE SAME QUESTION I'VE BEEN HERE ONLY A FEW MINUTES AND I'VE ALREADY TOLD STRAWN THAT I SHALL PROBABLY BE UNABLE TO FIX THE HOUR OF DEATH
1845-145083-0020 WITH ANY DEGREE OF ACCURACY TOOK YOUR TIME DIDN'T YOU BONNIE CAPTAIN STRAWN GREETED HIS FORMER SUBORDINATE ON THE HOMICIDE SQUAD DOC SAYS HE'S BEEN DEAD BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE HOURS SINCE IT'S NEARLY TEN NOW
1845-145083-0021 THAT MEANS SPRAGUE WAS KILLED SOME TIME BETWEEN NINE AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT BETTER SAY BETWEEN NINE O'CLOCK AND MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT DOCTOR PRICE SUGGESTED HE MAY HAVE LIVED AN HOUR OR MORE UNCONSCIOUS OF COURSE
1845-145083-0022 FOR THE INDICATIONS ARE THAT HE DID NOT DIE INSTANTLY BUT STAGGERED A FEW STEPS CLUTCHING AT THE WOUND BUT OF COURSE I SHALL HAVE TO PERFORM AN AUTOPSY FIRST DUNDEE CROSSED THE ROOM STEPPING OVER THE DEAD MAN'S STICK
1845-145083-0023 A SWANK AFFAIR OF DARK POLISHED WOOD WITH A HEAVY KNOB OF CARVED ONYX WHICH LAY ABOUT A FOOT BEYOND THE REACH OF THE CURLED FINGERS OF THE STIFF RIGHT HAND SPRAGUE'S HAT HE ASKED POINTING TO A BRIGHTLY BANDED STRAW WHICH LAY UPON THE TOP OF THE CABINET
1845-145083-0024 YES STRAWN ANSWERED AND DID YOU NOTICE THE WINDOW SCREEN HE POINTED TO THE WINDOW IN FRONT OF WHICH THE BODY LAY THE SASH OF LEADED PANES WAS RAISED AS HIGH AS IT WOULD GO AND BENEATH IT WAS A SCREEN OF THE ROLLER CURTAIN TYPE
1845-145083-0025 AND STRAWN BEGAN EAGERLY YOU'LL HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS RIGHT NOW BOY YOU'VE SNEERED AT MY GUNMAN THEORY AND TRIED TO PIN NITA'S MURDER ON ONE OF HAMILTON'S FINEST BUNCH OF PEOPLE BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO ADMIT NOW THAT EVERY DETAIL OF THIS SET UP BEARS ME OUT YES
1845-145083-0026 AND I HAVE MILES WORD FOR IT AIN'T ANY TOO GLAD TO SEE HIM AND SHOWS IT HE PHONES FOR A TAXI TO GO BACK TO HIS HOTEL ABOUT NINE FIFTEEN THAT WAS MILES SAYS BUT DECIDES TO WALK DOWN THE HILL TO MEET IT
1845-145083-0027 DON'T WANT TO GO BACK OUT ON THE PORCH AND LIE ABOUT HAVING HAD A GOOD TIME WHEN HE HASN'T WELL HE OPENS THE FRONT DOOR OR WHAT WOULD BE THE FRONT DOOR IF THIS WAS ANY ORDINARY HOUSE BUT BEFORE HE STEPS OUT HE SEES OR HEARS SOMETHING
1845-145083-0028 PROBABLY A RUSTLING IN THE HEDGE ACROSS THE DRIVEWAY OR MAYBE HE EVEN SEES A FACE IN THE LIGHT FROM THE LANTERNS ON EACH SIDE OF THE DOOR HE FEELS SURE NITA'S MURDERER HAS TRAILED HIM AND IS LYING IN WAIT FOR HIM IN A PANIC HE DARTS INTO THIS ROOM
1845-145083-0029 I'VE GOT MILES WORD FOR IT THAT NEITHER HE NOR ANYBODY ELSE HEARD A SHOT OF COURSE NOBODY KNEW SPRAGUE WAS IN HERE AND SINCE HIS HAT AND STICK WAS BOTH MISSING FROM THE HALL CLOSET THEY TOOK IT FOR GRANTED HE'D BEAT IT ANY OBJECTIONS TO THAT THEORY BOY
1845-145083-0030 JUST A FEW ONE IN PARTICULAR DUNDEE SAID BUT I GRANT IT'S A GOOD ONE PROVIDED DOCTOR PRICE'S AUTOPSY BEARS YOU OUT AS TO THE COURSE OF THE BULLET AND THAT CARRAWAY FINDS SPRAGUE'S FINGERPRINTS ON THAT CONTRIVANCE FOR RAISING THE SCREEN EVEN THEN
1845-145083-0031 BUT DUNDEE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE FOR STRAWN WAS SUMMONED TO THE TELEPHONE BY WHITSON WHEN HE RETURNED THERE WAS A SLIGHTLY BEWILDERED LOOK ON HIS HEAVY OLD FACE THAT'S FUNNY COLLINS THE LAD I SENT TO CHECK UP ON THE TAXI COMPANIES
1845-145083-0032 SAYS HE'S LOCATED THE DRIVER THAT ANSWERED SPRAGUE'S CALL LAST NIGHT THE DRIVER SAYS HE WAS CALLED ABOUT NINE FIFTEEN TOLD TO COME IMMEDIATELY AND TO WAIT FOR SPRAGUE AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL ON THE MAIN ROAD
