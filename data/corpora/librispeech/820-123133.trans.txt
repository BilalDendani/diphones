820-123133-0000 THE LETTER ON THE SIXTEENTH OF APRIL NEARLY SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DAY JUST DESCRIBED PAPA ENTERED OUR SCHOOLROOM AND TOLD US THAT THAT NIGHT WE MUST START WITH HIM FOR OUR COUNTRY HOUSE
820-123133-0001 I FELT A PANG AT MY HEART WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS AND MY THOUGHTS AT ONCE TURNED TO MAMMA THE CAUSE OF OUR UNEXPECTED DEPARTURE WAS THE FOLLOWING LETTER PETROVSKOE TWELFTH APRIL ONLY THIS MOMENT
820-123133-0002 HAVE I RECEIVED YOUR DEAR LETTER OF THE THIRD OF APRIL BUT AS USUAL I ANSWER IT AT ONCE
820-123133-0003 BUT AS IT WAS LATE HE DID NOT GIVE IT TO MIMI TILL THIS MORNING AND MIMI SINCE I WAS UNWELL KEPT IT FROM ME ALL DAY I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE FEVERISH IN FACT TO TELL THE TRUTH
820-123133-0004 THIS IS THE FOURTH DAY THAT I HAVE BEEN IN BED YET DO NOT BE UNEASY I FEEL ALMOST MYSELF AGAIN NOW
820-123133-0005 I THINK OF GETTING UP TO MORROW ON FRIDAY LAST I TOOK THE GIRLS FOR A DRIVE AND CLOSE TO THE LITTLE BRIDGE BY THE TURNING ON TO THE HIGH ROAD THE PLACE WHICH ALWAYS MAKES ME NERVOUS
820-123133-0006 THE HORSES AND CARRIAGE STUCK FAST IN THE MUD WELL THE DAY BEING FINE I THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD WALK A LITTLE UP THE ROAD UNTIL THE CARRIAGE SHOULD BE EXTRICATED BUT NO SOONER HAD WE REACHED THE CHAPEL
820-123133-0007 THAN I FELT OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN I WAS SO TIRED AND IN THIS WAY HALF AN HOUR PASSED WHILE HELP WAS BEING SENT FOR TO GET THE CARRIAGE DUG OUT I FELT COLD FOR I HAD ONLY THIN BOOTS ON AND THEY HAD BEEN WET THROUGH
820-123133-0008 AFTER LUNCHEON TOO I HAD ALTERNATE COLD AND HOT FITS YET STILL CONTINUED TO FOLLOW OUR ORDINARY ROUTINE
820-123133-0009 YOU WOULD BE ASTONISHED TO HEAR WHAT PROGRESS SHE HAS MADE BUT IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I FOUND THAT I COULD NOT COUNT THE BEATS SEVERAL TIMES I BEGAN TO DO SO YET ALWAYS FELT CONFUSED IN MY HEAD
820-123133-0010 AND KEPT HEARING STRANGE NOISES IN MY EARS I WOULD BEGIN ONE TWO THREE AND THEN SUDDENLY GO ON EIGHT FIFTEEN AND SO ON AS THOUGH I WERE TALKING NONSENSE AND COULD NOT HELP IT
820-123133-0011 AT LAST MIMI CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE AND FORCED ME TO RETIRE TO BED THAT WAS HOW MY ILLNESS BEGAN AND IT WAS ALL THROUGH MY OWN FAULT THE NEXT DAY I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF FEVER
820-123133-0012 HE HAS NOT LEFT US SINCE BUT PROMISES SOON TO RESTORE ME TO THE WORLD WHAT A WONDERFUL OLD MAN HE IS
820-123133-0013 WHILE I WAS FEVERISH AND DELIRIOUS HE SAT THE WHOLE NIGHT BY MY BEDSIDE WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES AND AT THIS MOMENT SINCE HE KNOWS I AM BUSY WRITING HE IS WITH THE GIRLS IN THE DIVANNAIA
820-123133-0014 AND I CAN HEAR HIM TELLING THEM GERMAN STORIES AND THEM LAUGHING AS THEY LISTEN TO HIM LA BELLE FLAMANDE AS YOU CALL HER IS NOW SPENDING HER SECOND WEEK HERE AS MY GUEST HER MOTHER HAVING GONE TO PAY A VISIT SOMEWHERE
820-123133-0015 AND SHE IS MOST ATTENTIVE AND ATTACHED TO ME SHE EVEN TELLS ME HER SECRET AFFAIRS UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES HER BEAUTIFUL FACE GOOD TEMPER AND YOUTH MIGHT HAVE MADE A MOST EXCELLENT GIRL OF HER
820-123133-0016 BUT IN THE SOCIETY IN WHICH ACCORDING TO HER OWN ACCOUNT SHE MOVES SHE WILL BE WASTED THE IDEA HAS MORE THAN ONCE OCCURRED TO ME THAT HAD I NOT HAD SO MANY CHILDREN OF MY OWN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEED OF MERCY TO HAVE ADOPTED HER
820-123133-0017 LUBOTSHKA HAD MEANT TO WRITE TO YOU HERSELF BUT SHE HAS TORN UP THREE SHEETS OF PAPER SAYING I KNOW WHAT A QUIZZER PAPA ALWAYS IS IF HE WERE TO FIND A SINGLE FAULT IN MY LETTER HE WOULD SHOW IT TO EVERYBODY
820-123133-0018 KATENKA IS AS CHARMING AS USUAL AND MIMI TOO IS GOOD BUT TIRESOME NOW LET ME SPEAK OF MORE SERIOUS MATTERS YOU WRITE TO ME THAT YOUR AFFAIRS ARE NOT GOING WELL THIS WINTER
820-123133-0019 AND THAT YOU WISH TO BREAK INTO THE REVENUES OF CHABAROVSKA IT SEEMS TO ME STRANGE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK IT NECESSARY TO ASK MY CONSENT SURELY WHAT BELONGS TO ME BELONGS NO LESS TO YOU YOU ARE SO KIND HEARTED DEAR

820-123133-0022 UPON YOUR INCOME THEREFORE YOUR LOSSES CAUSE ME AS LITTLE ANXIETY AS YOUR GAINS GIVE ME PLEASURE WHAT I REALLY GRIEVE OVER IS YOUR UNHAPPY PASSION ITSELF FOR GAMBLING
820-123133-0023 A PASSION WHICH BEREAVES ME OF PART OF YOUR TENDER AFFECTION AND OBLIGES ME TO TELL YOU SUCH BITTER TRUTHS AS GOD KNOWS WITH WHAT PAIN I AM NOW TELLING YOU I NEVER CEASE TO BESEECH HIM THAT HE MAY PRESERVE US
820-123133-0024 NOT FROM POVERTY FOR WHAT IS POVERTY BUT FROM THE TERRIBLE JUNCTURE WHICH WOULD ARISE SHOULD THE INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN WHICH I AM CALLED UPON TO PROTECT EVER COME INTO COLLISION WITH OUR OWN
820-123133-0025 HITHERTO GOD HAS LISTENED TO MY PRAYERS YOU HAVE NEVER YET OVERSTEPPED THE LIMIT BEYOND WHICH WE SHOULD BE OBLIGED EITHER TO SACRIFICE PROPERTY WHICH WOULD NO LONGER BELONG TO US BUT TO THE CHILDREN OR

820-123133-0033 AND I ONLY NEED YOUR PRESENCE TO REALISE THEM THE REST OF THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN FRENCH AS WELL AS IN A STRANGE UNCERTAIN HAND ON ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER I TRANSCRIBE IT WORD FOR WORD
820-123133-0034 DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE JUST WRITTEN TO YOU ABOUT MY ILLNESS IT IS MORE SERIOUS THAN ANY ONE KNOWS I ALONE KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER LEAVE MY BED AGAIN DO NOT THEREFORE DELAY A MINUTE IN COMING HERE WITH THE CHILDREN
820-123133-0035 PERHAPS IT MAY YET BE PERMITTED ME TO EMBRACE AND BLESS THEM IT IS MY LAST WISH THAT IT SHOULD BE SO I KNOW WHAT A TERRIBLE BLOW THIS WILL BE TO YOU BUT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO HEAR IT SOONER OR LATER IF NOT FROM ME
820-123133-0036 AT LEAST FROM OTHERS LET US TRY TO BEAR THE CALAMITY WITH FORTITUDE AND PLACE OUR TRUST IN THE MERCY OF GOD LET US SUBMIT OURSELVES TO HIS WILL DO NOT THINK THAT WHAT I AM WRITING IS SOME DELUSION OF MY SICK IMAGINATION
820-123133-0037 ON THE CONTRARY I AM PERFECTLY CLEAR AT THIS MOMENT AND ABSOLUTELY CALM NOR MUST YOU COMFORT YOURSELF WITH THE FALSE HOPE THAT THESE ARE THE UNREAL CONFUSED FEELINGS OF A DESPONDENT SPIRIT
820-123133-0038 FOR I FEEL INDEED I KNOW SINCE GOD HAS DEIGNED TO REVEAL IT TO ME THAT I HAVE NOW BUT A VERY SHORT TIME TO LIVE WILL MY LOVE FOR YOU AND THE CHILDREN CEASE WITH MY LIFE I KNOW THAT THAT CAN NEVER BE
820-123133-0039 AT THIS MOMENT I AM TOO FULL OF THAT LOVE TO BE CAPABLE OF BELIEVING THAT SUCH A FEELING WHICH CONSTITUTES A PART OF MY VERY EXISTENCE CAN EVER PERISH MY SOUL CAN NEVER LACK ITS LOVE FOR YOU
820-123133-0040 AND I KNOW THAT THAT LOVE WILL EXIST FOR EVER SINCE SUCH A FEELING COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN AWAKENED IF IT WERE NOT TO BE ETERNAL I SHALL NO LONGER BE WITH YOU YET I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MY LOVE WILL CLEAVE TO YOU ALWAYS
820-123133-0041 AND FROM THAT THOUGHT I GLEAN SUCH COMFORT THAT I AWAIT THE APPROACH OF DEATH CALMLY AND WITHOUT FEAR YES I AM CALM AND GOD KNOWS THAT I HAVE EVER LOOKED AND DO LOOK NOW
820-123133-0042 UPON DEATH AS NO MORE THAN THE PASSAGE TO A BETTER LIFE YET WHY DO TEARS BLIND MY EYES WHY SHOULD THE CHILDREN LOSE A MOTHER'S LOVE
820-123133-0043 WHY MUST YOU MY HUSBAND EXPERIENCE SUCH A HEAVY AND UNLOOKED FOR BLOW WHY MUST I DIE WHEN YOUR LOVE WAS MAKING LIFE SO INEXPRESSIBLY HAPPY FOR ME BUT HIS HOLY WILL BE DONE
820-123133-0044 THE TEARS PREVENT MY WRITING MORE IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN I THANK YOU MY DARLING BEYOND ALL PRICE FOR ALL THE FELICITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE SURROUNDED ME IN THIS LIFE
820-123133-0045 SOON I SHALL APPEAR BEFORE GOD HIMSELF TO PRAY THAT HE MAY REWARD YOU FAREWELL MY DEAREST REMEMBER THAT IF I AM NO LONGER HERE
