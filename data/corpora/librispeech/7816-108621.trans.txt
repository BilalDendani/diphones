7816-108621-0000 THE PANGS OF HUNGER AND THIRST THEN RETURNED ABSORBING ALL OTHER CARES AND CONSIDERATIONS NOTHING HOWEVER COULD BE DONE UNTIL THE MORNING AND SECURING OURSELVES AS WELL AS POSSIBLE WE ENDEAVOURED TO SNATCH A LITTLE REPOSE
7816-108621-0001 IN THIS I SUCCEEDED BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS SLEEPING UNTIL MY COMPANIONS WHO HAD NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE AROUSED ME AT DAYBREAK TO RENEW OUR ATTEMPTS AT GETTING UP PROVISIONS FROM THE HULL
7816-108621-0002 IT WAS NOW A DEAD CALM WITH THE SEA AS SMOOTH AS HAVE EVER KNOWN IT THE WEATHER WARM AND PLEASANT THE BRIG WAS OUT OF SIGHT WE COMMENCED OUR OPERATIONS BY WRENCHING OFF WITH SOME TROUBLE ANOTHER OF THE FORECHAINS
7816-108621-0003 AND HAVING FASTENED BOTH TO PETERS FEET HE AGAIN MADE AN ENDEAVOUR TO REACH THE DOOR OF THE STOREROOM THINKING IT POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FORCE IT OPEN PROVIDED HE COULD GET AT IT IN SUFFICIENT TIME
7816-108621-0004 AND THIS HE HOPED TO DO AS THE HULK LAY MUCH MORE STEADILY THAN BEFORE HE SUCCEEDED VERY QUICKLY IN REACHING THE DOOR WHEN LOOSENING ONE OF THE CHAINS FROM HIS ANKLE HE MADE EVERY EXERTION TO FORCE THE PASSAGE WITH IT BUT IN VAIN
7816-108621-0005 THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ROOM BEING FAR STRONGER THAN WAS ANTICIPATED HE WAS QUITE EXHAUSTED WITH HIS LONG STAY UNDER WATER AND IT BECAME ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT SOME OTHER ONE OF US SHOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7816-108621-0006 FOR THIS SERVICE PARKER IMMEDIATELY VOLUNTEERED BUT AFTER MAKING THREE INEFFECTUAL EFFORTS FOUND THAT HE COULD NEVER EVEN SUCCEED IN GETTING NEAR THE DOOR THE CONDITION OF AUGUSTUS'S WOUNDED ARM RENDERED IT USELESS FOR HIM TO ATTEMPT GOING DOWN
7816-108621-0007 AS HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO FORCE THE ROOM OPEN SHOULD HE REACH IT AND IT ACCORDINGLY NOW DEVOLVED UPON ME TO EXERT MYSELF FOR OUR COMMON DELIVERANCE PETERS HAD LEFT ONE OF THE CHAINS IN THE PASSAGE AND I FOUND UPON PLUNGING IN
7816-108621-0008 THAT I HAD NOT SUFFICIENT BALANCE TO KEEP ME FIRMLY DOWN I DETERMINED THEREFORE TO ATTEMPT NO MORE IN MY FIRST EFFORT THAN MERELY TO RECOVER THE OTHER CHAIN
7816-108621-0009 I FELT A HARD SUBSTANCE WHICH I IMMEDIATELY GRASPED NOT HAVING TIME TO ASCERTAIN WHAT IT WAS BUT RETURNING AND ASCENDING INSTANTLY TO THE SURFACE THE PRIZE PROVED TO BE A BOTTLE AND OUR JOY MAY BE CONCEIVED
7816-108621-0010 WHEN I SAY THAT IT WAS FOUND TO BE FULL OF PORT WINE GIVING THANKS TO GOD FOR THIS TIMELY AND CHEERING ASSISTANCE WE IMMEDIATELY DREW THE CORK WITH MY PENKNIFE AND EACH TAKING A MODERATE SUP FELT THE MOST INDESCRIBABLE COMFORT FROM THE WARMTH
7816-108621-0011 STRENGTH AND SPIRITS WITH WHICH IT INSPIRED US WE THEN CAREFULLY RECORKED THE BOTTLE AND BY MEANS OF A HANDKERCHIEF SWUNG IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF ITS GETTING BROKEN
7816-108621-0012 HAVING RESTED A WHILE AFTER THIS FORTUNATE DISCOVERY I AGAIN DESCENDED AND NOW RECOVERED THE CHAIN WITH WHICH I INSTANTLY CAME UP I THEN FASTENED IT ON AND WENT DOWN FOR THE THIRD TIME
7816-108621-0013 WHEN I BECAME FULLY SATISFIED THAT NO EXERTIONS WHATEVER IN THAT SITUATION WOULD ENABLE ME TO FORCE OPEN THE DOOR OF THE STOREROOM I THEREFORE RETURNED IN DESPAIR THERE SEEMED NOW TO BE NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR HOPE
7816-108621-0014 AND I COULD PERCEIVE IN THE COUNTENANCES OF MY COMPANIONS THAT THEY HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO PERISH THE WINE HAD EVIDENTLY PRODUCED IN THEM A SPECIES OF DELIRIUM
7816-108621-0015 WHICH PERHAPS I HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM FEELING BY THE IMMERSION I HAD UNDERGONE SINCE DRINKING IT THEY TALKED INCOHERENTLY AND ABOUT MATTERS UNCONNECTED WITH OUR CONDITION PETERS REPEATEDLY ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT NANTUCKET
7816-108621-0016 AUGUSTUS TOO I REMEMBER APPROACHED ME WITH A SERIOUS AIR AND REQUESTED ME TO LEND HIM A POCKET COMB AS HIS HAIR WAS FULL OF FISH SCALES AND HE WISHED TO GET THEM OUT BEFORE GOING ON SHORE PARKER APPEARED SOMEWHAT LESS AFFECTED
7816-108621-0017 AND URGED ME TO DIVE AT RANDOM INTO THE CABIN AND BRING UP ANY ARTICLE WHICH MIGHT COME TO HAND TO THIS I CONSENTED AND IN THE FIRST ATTEMPT AFTER STAYING UNDER A FULL MINUTE BROUGHT UP A SMALL LEATHER TRUNK BELONGING TO CAPTAIN BARNARD
7816-108621-0018 THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY OPENED IN THE FAINT HOPE THAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN SOMETHING TO EAT OR DRINK WE FOUND NOTHING HOWEVER EXCEPT A BOX OF RAZORS AND TWO LINEN SHIRTS I NOW WENT DOWN AGAIN AND RETURNED WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS
7816-108621-0019 AS MY HEAD CAME ABOVE WATER I HEARD A CRASH ON DECK AND UPON GETTING UP SAW THAT MY COMPANIONS HAD UNGRATEFULLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF MY ABSENCE TO DRINK THE REMAINDER OF THE WINE HAVING LET THE BOTTLE FALL IN THE ENDEAVOUR TO REPLACE IT BEFORE I SAW THEM
7816-108621-0020 I REMONSTRATED WITH THEM ON THE HEARTLESSNESS OF THEIR CONDUCT WHEN AUGUSTUS BURST INTO TEARS THE OTHER TWO ENDEAVOURED TO LAUGH THE MATTER OFF AS A JOKE BUT I HOPE NEVER AGAIN TO BEHOLD LAUGHTER OF SUCH A SPECIES
7816-108621-0021 THE DISTORTION OF COUNTENANCE WAS ABSOLUTELY FRIGHTFUL INDEED IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE STIMULUS IN THE EMPTY STATE OF THEIR STOMACHS HAD TAKEN INSTANT AND VIOLENT EFFECT AND THAT THEY WERE ALL EXCEEDINGLY INTOXICATED
7816-108621-0022 WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY I PREVAILED UPON THEM TO LIE DOWN WHEN THEY FELL VERY SOON INTO A HEAVY SLUMBER ACCOMPANIED WITH LOUD STERTOROUS BREATHING I NOW FOUND MYSELF AS IT WERE ALONE IN THE BRIG AND MY REFLECTIONS TO BE SURE
7816-108621-0023 WERE OF THE MOST FEARFUL AND GLOOMY NATURE NO PROSPECT OFFERED ITSELF TO MY VIEW BUT A LINGERING DEATH BY FAMINE OR AT THE BEST BY BEING OVERWHELMED IN THE FIRST GALE WHICH SHOULD SPRING UP
7816-108621-0024 FOR IN OUR PRESENT EXHAUSTED CONDITION WE COULD HAVE NO HOPE OF LIVING THROUGH ANOTHER THE GNAWING HUNGER WHICH I NOW EXPERIENCED WAS NEARLY INSUPPORTABLE AND I FELT MYSELF CAPABLE OF GOING TO ANY LENGTHS IN ORDER TO APPEASE IT
7816-108621-0025 WITH MY KNIFE I CUT OFF A SMALL PORTION OF THE LEATHER TRUNK AND ENDEAVOURED TO EAT IT BUT FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SWALLOW A SINGLE MORSEL ALTHOUGH I FANCIED THAT SOME LITTLE ALLEVIATION OF MY SUFFERING WAS OBTAINED
7816-108621-0026 BY CHEWING SMALL PIECES OF IT AND SPITTING THEM OUT TOWARD NIGHT MY COMPANIONS AWOKE ONE BY ONE EACH IN AN INDESCRIBABLE STATE OF WEAKNESS AND HORROR BROUGHT ON BY THE WINE WHOSE FUMES HAD NOW EVAPORATED
7816-108621-0027 AND UTTERED THE MOST LAMENTABLE CRIES FOR WATER THEIR CONDITION AFFECTED ME IN THE MOST LIVELY DEGREE AT THE SAME TIME CAUSING ME TO REJOICE IN THE FORTUNATE TRAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAD PREVENTED ME FROM INDULGING IN THE WINE
7816-108621-0028 I HAD NOT YET ABANDONED ALL IDEA BEING ABLE TO GET UP SOMETHING FROM BELOW BUT THE ATTEMPT COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE RESUMED UNTIL SOME ONE OF THEM WAS SUFFICIENTLY MASTER OF HIMSELF TO AID ME BY HOLDING THE END OF THE ROPE WHILE I WENT DOWN
7816-108621-0029 PARKER APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE IN POSSESSION OF HIS SENSES THAN THE OTHERS AND I ENDEAVOURED BY EVERY MEANS IN MY POWER TO ROUSE HIM THINKING THAT A PLUNGE IN THE SEA WATER MIGHT HAVE A BENEFICIAL EFFECT I CONTRIVED TO FASTEN THE END OF A ROPE AROUND HIS BODY
7816-108621-0030 AND THEN LEADING HIM TO THE COMPANION WAY HE REMAINING QUITE PASSIVE ALL THE WHILE PUSHED HIM IN AND IMMEDIATELY DREW HIM OUT I HAD GOOD REASON TO CONGRATULATE MYSELF UPON HAVING MADE THIS EXPERIMENT
7816-108621-0031 FOR HE APPEARED MUCH REVIVED AND INVIGORATED AND UPON GETTING OUT ASKED ME IN A RATIONAL MANNER WHY I HAD SO SERVED HIM
7816-108621-0032 HAVING EXPLAINED MY OBJECT HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF INDEBTED TO ME AND SAID THAT HE FELT GREATLY BETTER FROM THE IMMERSION AFTERWARD CONVERSING SENSIBLY UPON OUR SITUATION WE THEN RESOLVED TO TREAT AUGUSTUS AND PETERS IN THE SAME WAY WHICH WE IMMEDIATELY DID
7816-108621-0033 WHEN THEY BOTH EXPERIENCED MUCH BENEFIT FROM THE SHOCK THIS IDEA OF SUDDEN IMMERSION HAD BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME BY READING IN SOME MEDICAL WORK THE GOOD EFFECT OF THE SHOWER BATH IN A CASE WHERE THE PATIENT WAS SUFFERING FROM MANIA A POTU
7816-108621-0034 FINDING THAT I COULD NOW TRUST MY COMPANIONS TO HOLD THE END OF THE ROPE I AGAIN MADE THREE OR FOUR PLUNGES INTO THE CABIN ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOW QUITE DARK AND A GENTLE BUT LONG SWELL FROM THE NORTHWARD RENDERED THE HULK SOMEWHAT UNSTEADY
7816-108621-0035 IN THE COURSE OF THESE ATTEMPTS I SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING UP TWO CASE KNIVES A THREE GALLON JUG EMPTY AND A BLANKET BUT NOTHING WHICH COULD SERVE US FOR FOOD I CONTINUED MY EFFORTS AFTER GETTING THESE ARTICLES UNTIL I WAS COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED
7816-108621-0036 BUT BROUGHT UP NOTHING ELSE DURING THE NIGHT PARKER AND PETERS OCCUPIED THEMSELVES BY TURNS IN THE SAME MANNER BUT NOTHING COMING TO HAND WE NOW GAVE UP THIS ATTEMPT IN DESPAIR CONCLUDING THAT WE WERE EXHAUSTING OURSELVES IN VAIN
7816-108621-0037 WE PASSED THE REMAINDER OF THIS NIGHT IN A STATE OF THE MOST INTENSE MENTAL AND BODILY ANGUISH THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE IMAGINED THE MORNING OF THE SIXTEENTH AT LENGTH DAWNED AND WE LOOKED EAGERLY AROUND THE HORIZON FOR RELIEF
7816-108621-0038 BUT TO NO PURPOSE THE SEA WAS STILL SMOOTH WITH ONLY A LONG SWELL FROM THE NORTHWARD AS ON YESTERDAY THIS WAS THE SIXTH DAY SINCE WE HAD TASTED EITHER FOOD OR DRINK
7816-108621-0039 HAD I MET THEM ON SHORE IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION THAT I HAD EVER BEHELD THEM THEIR COUNTENANCES WERE TOTALLY CHANGED IN CHARACTER
7816-108621-0040 SO THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO BELIEVE THEM REALLY THE SAME INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM I HAD BEEN IN COMPANY BUT A FEW DAYS BEFORE PARKER ALTHOUGH SADLY REDUCED AND SO FEEBLE THAT HE COULD NOT RAISE HIS HEAD FROM HIS BOSOM WAS NOT SO FAR GONE AS THE OTHER TWO
7816-108621-0041 HE SUFFERED WITH GREAT PATIENCE MAKING NO COMPLAINT AND ENDEAVOURING TO INSPIRE US WITH HOPE IN EVERY MANNER HE COULD DEVISE FOR MYSELF ALTHOUGH AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE VOYAGE I HAD BEEN IN BAD HEALTH
7816-108621-0042 AND WAS AT ALL TIMES OF A DELICATE CONSTITUTION I SUFFERED LESS THAN ANY OF US BEING MUCH LESS REDUCED IN FRAME AND RETAINING MY POWERS OF MIND IN A SURPRISING DEGREE WHILE THE REST WERE COMPLETELY PROSTRATED IN INTELLECT
7816-108621-0043 GENERALLY SIMPERING IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS WITH IDIOTIC SMILES AND UTTERING THE MOST ABSURD PLATITUDES AT INTERVALS HOWEVER THEY WOULD APPEAR TO REVIVE SUDDENLY AS IF INSPIRED ALL AT ONCE WITH A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEIR CONDITION
7816-108621-0044 WHEN THEY WOULD SPRING UPON THEIR FEET IN A MOMENTARY FLASH OF VIGOUR AND SPEAK FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF THEIR PROSPECTS IN A MANNER ALTOGETHER RATIONAL ALTHOUGH FULL OF THE MOST INTENSE DESPAIR
7816-108621-0045 IT IS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT MY COMPANIONS MAY HAVE ENTERTAINED THE SAME OPINION OF THEIR OWN CONDITION AS I DID OF MINE AND THAT I MAY HAVE UNWITTINGLY BEEN GUILTY OF THE SAME EXTRAVAGANCES AND IMBECILITIES AS THEMSELVES
7816-108621-0046 THIS IS A MATTER WHICH CANNOT BE DETERMINED ABOUT NOON PARKER DECLARED THAT HE SAW LAND OFF THE LARBOARD QUARTER AND IT WAS WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY I COULD RESTRAIN HIM FROM PLUNGING INTO THE SEA WITH THE VIEW OF SWIMMING TOWARD IT
7816-108621-0047 PETERS AND AUGUSTUS TOOK LITTLE NOTICE OF WHAT HE SAID BEING APPARENTLY WRAPPED UP IN MOODY CONTEMPLATION UPON LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT I COULD NOT PERCEIVE THE FAINTEST APPEARANCE OF THE SHORE
7816-108621-0048 INDEED I WAS TOO WELL AWARE THAT WE WERE FAR FROM ANY LAND TO INDULGE IN A HOPE OF THAT NATURE IT WAS A LONG TIME NEVERTHELESS BEFORE I COULD CONVINCE PARKER OF HIS MISTAKE
7816-108621-0049 WEEPING LIKE A CHILD WITH LOUD CRIES AND SOBS FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS WHEN BECOMING EXHAUSTED HE FELL ASLEEP PETERS AND AUGUSTUS NOW MADE SEVERAL INEFFECTUAL EFFORTS TO SWALLOW PORTIONS OF THE LEATHER
7816-108621-0050 I ADVISED THEM TO CHEW IT AND SPIT IT OUT BUT THEY WERE TOO EXCESSIVELY DEBILITATED TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW MY ADVICE I CONTINUED TO CHEW PIECES OF IT AT INTERVALS AND FOUND SOME RELIEF FROM SO DOING
7816-108621-0051 MY CHIEF DISTRESS WAS FOR WATER AND I WAS ONLY PREVENTED FROM TAKING A DRAUGHT FROM THE SEA BY REMEMBERING THE HORRIBLE CONSEQUENCES WHICH THUS HAVE RESULTED TO OTHERS WHO WERE SIMILARLY SITUATED WITH OURSELVES
7816-108621-0052 THE DAY WORE ON IN THIS MANNER WHEN I SUDDENLY DISCOVERED A SAIL TO THE EASTWARD AND ON OUR LARBOARD BOW SHE APPEARED TO BE A LARGE SHIP AND WAS COMING NEARLY ATHWART US BEING PROBABLY TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MILES DISTANT
7816-108621-0053 NONE OF MY COMPANIONS HAD AS YET DISCOVERED HER AND I FORBORE TO TELL THEM OF HER FOR THE PRESENT LEST WE MIGHT AGAIN BE DISAPPOINTED OF RELIEF AT LENGTH UPON HER GETTING NEARER I SAW DISTINCTLY THAT SHE WAS HEADING IMMEDIATELY FOR US WITH HER LIGHT SAILS FILLED
7816-108621-0054 I COULD NOW CONTAIN MYSELF NO LONGER AND POINTED HER OUT TO MY FELLOW SUFFERERS
7816-108621-0055 AGAIN INDULGING IN THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT DEMONSTRATIONS OF JOY WEEPING LAUGHING IN AN IDIOTIC MANNER JUMPING STAMPING UPON THE DECK TEARING THEIR HAIR AND PRAYING AND CURSING BY TURNS I WAS SO AFFECTED BY THEIR CONDUCT
7816-108621-0056 AS WELL AS BY WHAT I CONSIDERED A SURE PROSPECT OF DELIVERANCE THAT I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM JOINING IN WITH THEIR MADNESS AND GAVE WAY TO THE IMPULSES OF MY GRATITUDE AND ECSTASY BY LYING AND ROLLING ON THE DECK
7816-108621-0057 CLAPPING MY HANDS SHOUTING AND OTHER SIMILAR ACTS UNTIL I WAS SUDDENLY CALLED TO MY RECOLLECTION AND ONCE MORE TO THE EXTREME HUMAN MISERY AND DESPAIR BY PERCEIVING THE SHIP ALL AT ONCE WITH HER STERN FULLY PRESENTED TOWARD US
7816-108621-0058 AND STEERING IN A DIRECTION NEARLY OPPOSITE TO THAT IN WHICH I HAD AT FIRST PERCEIVED HER IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE I COULD INDUCE MY POOR COMPANIONS TO BELIEVE THAT THIS SAD REVERSE IN OUR PROSPECTS HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE
7816-108621-0059 THEY REPLIED TO ALL MY ASSERTIONS WITH A STARE AND A GESTURE IMPLYING THAT THEY WERE NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY SUCH MISREPRESENTATIONS THE CONDUCT OF AUGUSTUS MOST SENSIBLY AFFECTED ME IN SPITE OF ALL I COULD SAY OR DO TO THE CONTRARY
7816-108621-0060 HE PERSISTED IN SAYING THAT THE SHIP WAS RAPIDLY NEARING US AND IN MAKING PREPARATIONS TO GO ON BOARD OF HER SOME SEAWEED FLOATING BY THE BRIG HE MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS THE SHIP'S BOAT AND ENDEAVOURED TO THROW HIMSELF UPON IT
7816-108621-0061 HOWLING AND SHRIEKING IN THE MOST HEARTRENDING MANNER WHEN I FORCIBLY RESTRAINED HIM FROM THUS CASTING HIMSELF INTO THE SEA HAVING BECOME IN SOME DEGREE PACIFIED WE CONTINUED TO WATCH THE SHIP UNTIL WE FINALLY LOST SIGHT OF HER
7816-108621-0062 THE WEATHER BECOMING HAZY WITH A LIGHT BREEZE SPRINGING UP AS SOON AS SHE WAS ENTIRELY GONE PARKER TURNED SUDDENLY TOWARD ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE WHICH MADE ME SHUDDER
7816-108621-0063 THERE WAS ABOUT HIM AN AIR OF SELF POSSESSION WHICH I HAD NOT NOTICED IN HIM UNTIL NOW AND BEFORE HE OPENED HIS LIPS MY HEART TOLD ME WHAT HE WOULD SAY
