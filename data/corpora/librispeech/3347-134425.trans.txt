3347-134425-0000 THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE MAKE VARIOUS DECLARATIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND OTHERS TIM LINKINWATER MAKES A DECLARATION FOR HIMSELF SOME WEEKS HAD PASSED AND THE FIRST SHOCK OF THESE EVENTS HAD SUBSIDED
3347-134425-0001 MADELINE HAD BEEN REMOVED FRANK HAD BEEN ABSENT AND NICHOLAS AND KATE HAD BEGUN TO TRY IN GOOD EARNEST TO STIFLE THEIR OWN REGRETS AND TO LIVE FOR EACH OTHER AND FOR THEIR MOTHER WHO POOR LADY
3347-134425-0002 WHEN THERE CAME ONE EVENING PER FAVOUR OF MISTER LINKINWATER AN INVITATION FROM THE BROTHERS TO DINNER ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE COMPREHENDING NOT ONLY MISSUS NICKLEBY KATE AND NICHOLAS BUT LITTLE MISS LA CREEVY WHO WAS MOST PARTICULARLY MENTIONED
3347-134425-0003 NOW MY DEARS SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY WHEN THEY HAD RENDERED BECOMING HONOUR TO THE BIDDING AND TIM HAD TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN MOTHER ASKED NICHOLAS SMILING
3347-134425-0004 I SAY MY DEAR REJOINED THAT LADY WITH A FACE OF UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY WHAT DOES THIS INVITATION TO DINNER MEAN WHAT IS ITS INTENTION AND OBJECT I CONCLUDE IT MEANS
3347-134425-0005 THAT ON SUCH A DAY WE ARE TO EAT AND DRINK IN THEIR HOUSE AND THAT ITS INTENT AND OBJECT IS TO CONFER PLEASURE UPON US SAID NICHOLAS AND THAT'S ALL YOU CONCLUDE IT IS MY DEAR I HAVE NOT YET ARRIVED AT ANYTHING DEEPER MOTHER
3347-134425-0006 THEN I'LL JUST TELL YOU ONE THING SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT'S ALL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THAT THIS MEANS SOMETHING BESIDES DINNER TEA AND SUPPER PERHAPS SUGGESTED NICHOLAS
3347-134425-0007 I WOULDN'T BE ABSURD MY DEAR IF I WERE YOU REPLIED MISSUS NICKLEBY IN A LOFTY MANNER BECAUSE IT'S NOT BY ANY MEANS BECOMING AND DOESN'T SUIT YOU AT ALL
3347-134425-0008 THAT THE MISTER CHEERYBLES DON'T ASK US TO DINNER WITH ALL THIS CEREMONY FOR NOTHING NEVER MIND WAIT AND SEE YOU WON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING I SAY OF COURSE IT'S MUCH BETTER TO WAIT A GREAT DEAL BETTER IT'S SATISFACTORY TO ALL PARTIES
3347-134425-0009 AND THERE CAN BE NO DISPUTING ALL I SAY IS REMEMBER WHAT I SAY NOW AND WHEN I SAY I SAID SO DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WITH THIS STIPULATION MISSUS NICKLEBY WHO WAS TROUBLED NIGHT AND DAY
3347-134425-0010 WITH A VISION OF A HOT MESSENGER TEARING UP TO THE DOOR TO ANNOUNCE THAT NICHOLAS HAD BEEN TAKEN INTO PARTNERSHIP QUITTED THAT BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT AND ENTERED UPON A NEW ONE IT'S A VERY EXTRAORDINARY THING SHE SAID A MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING
3347-134425-0011 THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE INVITED MISS LA CREEVY IT QUITE ASTONISHES ME UPON MY WORD IT DOES OF COURSE IT'S VERY PLEASANT THAT SHE SHOULD BE INVITED VERY PLEASANT AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE'LL CONDUCT HERSELF EXTREMELY WELL SHE ALWAYS DOES
3347-134425-0012 IT'S VERY GRATIFYING TO THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MEANS OF INTRODUCING HER INTO SUCH SOCIETY AND I'M QUITE GLAD OF IT QUITE REJOICED FOR SHE CERTAINLY IS AN EXCEEDINGLY WELL BEHAVED AND GOOD NATURED LITTLE PERSON
3347-134425-0013 I COULD WISH THAT SOME FRIEND WOULD MENTION TO HER HOW VERY BADLY SHE HAS HER CAP TRIMMED AND WHAT VERY PREPOSTEROUS BOWS THOSE ARE BUT OF COURSE THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND IF SHE LIKES TO MAKE A FRIGHT OF HERSELF
3347-134425-0014 NO DOUBT SHE HAS A PERFECT RIGHT TO DO SO WE NEVER SEE OURSELVES NEVER DO AND NEVER DID AND I SUPPOSE WE NEVER SHALL THIS MORAL REFLECTION REMINDING HER OF THE NECESSITY OF BEING PECULIARLY SMART ON THE OCCASION
3347-134425-0015 SO AS TO COUNTERBALANCE MISS LA CREEVY AND BE HERSELF AN EFFECTUAL SET OFF AND ATONEMENT LED MISSUS NICKLEBY INTO A CONSULTATION WITH HER DAUGHTER RELATIVE TO CERTAIN RIBBONS GLOVES AND TRIMMINGS WHICH BEING A COMPLICATED QUESTION AND ONE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
3347-134425-0016 SOON ROUTED THE PREVIOUS ONE AND PUT IT TO FLIGHT THE GREAT DAY ARRIVING THE GOOD LADY PUT HERSELF UNDER KATE'S HANDS AN HOUR OR SO AFTER BREAKFAST AND DRESSING BY EASY STAGES COMPLETED HER TOILETTE IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO ALLOW OF HER DAUGHTER'S MAKING HERS
3347-134425-0017 WHICH WAS VERY SIMPLE AND NOT VERY LONG THOUGH SO SATISFACTORY THAT SHE HAD NEVER APPEARED MORE CHARMING OR LOOKED MORE LOVELY MISS LA CREEVY TOO ARRIVED WITH TWO BANDBOXES WHEREOF THE BOTTOMS FELL OUT AS THEY WERE HANDED FROM THE COACH AND SOMETHING IN A NEWSPAPER
3347-134425-0018 WHICH A GENTLEMAN HAD SAT UPON COMING DOWN AND WHICH WAS OBLIGED TO BE IRONED AGAIN BEFORE IT WAS FIT FOR SERVICE AT LAST EVERYBODY WAS DRESSED INCLUDING NICHOLAS WHO HAD COME HOME TO FETCH THEM AND THEY WENT AWAY IN A COACH SENT BY THE BROTHERS FOR THE PURPOSE
3347-134425-0019 MISSUS NICKLEBY WONDERING VERY MUCH WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE FOR DINNER AND CROSS EXAMINING NICHOLAS AS TO THE EXTENT OF HIS DISCOVERIES IN THE MORNING WHETHER HE HAD SMELT ANYTHING COOKING AT ALL LIKE TURTLE AND IF NOT WHAT HE HAD SMELT AND DIVERSIFYING THE CONVERSATION
3347-134425-0020 WITH REMINISCENCES OF DINNERS TO WHICH SHE HAD GONE SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO CONCERNING WHICH SHE PARTICULARISED NOT ONLY THE DISHES BUT THE GUESTS IN WHOM HER HEARERS DID NOT FEEL A VERY ABSORBING INTEREST
3347-134425-0021 AS NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER CHANCED TO HEAR THEIR NAMES BEFORE THE OLD BUTLER RECEIVED THEM WITH PROFOUND RESPECT AND MANY SMILES AND USHERED THEM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE THEY WERE RECEIVED BY THE BROTHERS WITH SO MUCH CORDIALITY AND KINDNESS
3347-134425-0022 THAT MISSUS NICKLEBY WAS QUITE IN A FLUTTER AND HAD SCARCELY PRESENCE OF MIND ENOUGH EVEN TO PATRONISE MISS LA CREEVY KATE WAS STILL MORE AFFECTED BY THE RECEPTION FOR KNOWING THAT THE BROTHERS WERE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HER AND FRANK
3347-134425-0023 SHE FELT HER POSITION A MOST DELICATE AND TRYING ONE AND WAS TREMBLING ON THE ARM OF NICHOLAS WHEN MISTER CHARLES TOOK HER IN HIS AND LED HER TO ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM HAVE YOU SEEN MADELINE MY DEAR HE SAID SINCE SHE LEFT YOUR HOUSE
3347-134425-0024 AH SAID THE OLD MAN PATTING HER ON THE HEAD AND SPEAKING AS AFFECTIONATELY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN HIS FAVOURITE CHILD POOR DEAR WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS BROTHER NED MADELINE HAS ONLY WRITTEN TO HER ONCE ONLY ONCE NED

3347-134425-0034 PAYABLE EITHER UPON HER COMING OF AGE OR MARRYING IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THIS GENTLEMAN ANGRY WITH HER HIS ONLY RELATION BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT PUT HERSELF UNDER HIS PROTECTION AND DETACH HERSELF FROM THE SOCIETY OF HER FATHER IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS REPEATED OVERTURES
