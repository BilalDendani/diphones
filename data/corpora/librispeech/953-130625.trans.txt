953-130625-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE FOOD QUESTION OBJECTIONS TO PARAFFINE OIL AS AN ATMOSPHERE ADVANTAGES OF CHEESE AS A TRAVELLING COMPANION A MARRIED WOMAN DESERTS HER HOME
953-130625-0001 FURTHER PROVISION FOR GETTING UPSET I PACK CUSSEDNESS OF TOOTH BRUSHES GEORGE AND HARRIS PACK AWFUL BEHAVIOUR OF MONTMORENCY WE RETIRE TO REST
953-130625-0002 THEN WE DISCUSSED THE FOOD QUESTION GEORGE SAID BEGIN WITH BREAKFAST GEORGE IS SO PRACTICAL NOW FOR BREAKFAST WE SHALL WANT A FRYING PAN
953-130625-0003 A TEA POT AND A KETTLE AND A METHYLATED SPIRIT STOVE NO OIL SAID GEORGE WITH A SIGNIFICANT LOOK AND HARRIS AND I AGREED WE HAD TAKEN UP AN OIL STOVE ONCE BUT NEVER AGAIN
953-130625-0004 IT HAD BEEN LIKE LIVING IN AN OIL SHOP THAT WEEK IT OOZED I NEVER SAW SUCH A THING AS PARAFFINE OIL IS TO OOZE WE KEPT IT IN THE NOSE OF THE BOAT AND FROM THERE IT OOZED DOWN TO THE RUDDER
953-130625-0005 IMPREGNATING THE WHOLE BOAT AND EVERYTHING IN IT ON ITS WAY AND IT OOZED OVER THE RIVER AND SATURATED THE SCENERY AND SPOILT THE ATMOSPHERE SOMETIMES A WESTERLY OILY WIND BLEW AND AT OTHER TIMES AN EASTERLY OILY WIND
953-130625-0006 AND SOMETIMES IT BLEW A NORTHERLY OILY WIND AND MAYBE A SOUTHERLY OILY WIND BUT WHETHER IT CAME FROM THE ARCTIC SNOWS OR WAS RAISED IN THE WASTE OF THE DESERT SANDS IT CAME ALIKE TO US LADEN WITH THE FRAGRANCE OF PARAFFINE OIL
953-130625-0007 AND THAT OIL OOZED UP AND RUINED THE SUNSET AND AS FOR THE MOONBEAMS THEY POSITIVELY REEKED OF PARAFFINE WE TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM IT AT MARLOW WE LEFT THE BOAT BY THE BRIDGE
953-130625-0008 AND TOOK A WALK THROUGH THE TOWN TO ESCAPE IT BUT IT FOLLOWED US THE WHOLE TOWN WAS FULL OF OIL WE PASSED THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN BURIED IN OIL THE HIGH STREET STUNK OF OIL
953-130625-0009 WE WONDERED HOW PEOPLE COULD LIVE IN IT AND WE WALKED MILES UPON MILES OUT BIRMINGHAM WAY BUT IT WAS NO USE THE COUNTRY WAS STEEPED IN OIL AT THE END OF THAT TRIP WE MET TOGETHER AT MIDNIGHT IN A LONELY FIELD
953-130625-0010 UNDER A BLASTED OAK AND TOOK AN AWFUL OATH WE HAD BEEN SWEARING FOR A WHOLE WEEK ABOUT THE THING IN AN ORDINARY MIDDLE CLASS WAY BUT THIS WAS A SWELL AFFAIR
953-130625-0011 AN AWFUL OATH NEVER TO TAKE PARAFFINE OIL WITH US IN A BOAT AGAIN EXCEPT OF COURSE IN CASE OF SICKNESS THEREFORE IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE
953-130625-0012 WE CONFINED OURSELVES TO METHYLATED SPIRIT EVEN THAT IS BAD ENOUGH YOU GET METHYLATED PIE AND METHYLATED CAKE BUT METHYLATED SPIRIT IS MORE WHOLESOME WHEN TAKEN INTO THE SYSTEM IN LARGE QUANTITIES THAN PARAFFINE OIL
953-130625-0013 FOR OTHER BREAKFAST THINGS GEORGE SUGGESTED EGGS AND BACON WHICH WERE EASY TO COOK COLD MEAT TEA BREAD AND BUTTER AND JAM FOR LUNCH HE SAID WE COULD HAVE BISCUITS COLD MEAT
953-130625-0014 BREAD AND BUTTER AND JAM BUT NO CHEESE CHEESE LIKE OIL MAKES TOO MUCH OF ITSELF IT WANTS THE WHOLE BOAT TO ITSELF IT GOES THROUGH THE HAMPER AND GIVES A CHEESY FLAVOUR TO EVERYTHING ELSE THERE
953-130625-0015 YOU CAN'T TELL WHETHER YOU ARE EATING APPLE PIE OR GERMAN SAUSAGE OR STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM IT ALL SEEMS CHEESE THERE IS TOO MUCH ODOUR ABOUT CHEESE I REMEMBER A FRIEND OF MINE
953-130625-0016 BUYING A COUPLE OF CHEESES AT LIVERPOOL SPLENDID CHEESES THEY WERE RIPE AND MELLOW AND WITH A TWO HUNDRED HORSE POWER SCENT ABOUT THEM THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WARRANTED TO CARRY THREE MILES AND KNOCK A MAN OVER AT TWO HUNDRED YARDS
953-130625-0017 HE WOULD GET ME TO TAKE THEM BACK WITH ME TO LONDON AS HE SHOULD NOT BE COMING UP FOR A DAY OR TWO HIMSELF AND HE DID NOT THINK THE CHEESES OUGHT TO BE KEPT MUCH LONGER OH WITH PLEASURE DEAR BOY I REPLIED WITH PLEASURE
953-130625-0018 I CALLED FOR THE CHEESES AND TOOK THEM AWAY IN A CAB IT WAS A RAMSHACKLE AFFAIR DRAGGED ALONG BY A KNOCK KNEED BROKEN WINDED SOMNAMBULIST WHICH HIS OWNER
953-130625-0019 IN A MOMENT OF ENTHUSIASM DURING CONVERSATION REFERRED TO AS A HORSE
953-130625-0020 THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO THE SWIFTEST STEAM ROLLER EVER BUILT AND ALL WENT MERRY AS A FUNERAL BELL UNTIL WE TURNED THE CORNER THERE THE WIND CARRIED A WHIFF FROM THE CHEESES FULL ON TO OUR STEED
953-130625-0021 IT WOKE HIM UP AND WITH A SNORT OF TERROR HE DASHED OFF AT THREE MILES AN HOUR THE WIND STILL BLEW IN HIS DIRECTION AND BEFORE WE REACHED THE END OF THE STREET HE WAS LAYING HIMSELF OUT AT THE RATE OF NEARLY FOUR MILES AN HOUR
953-130625-0022 LEAVING THE CRIPPLES AND STOUT OLD LADIES SIMPLY NOWHERE IT TOOK TWO PORTERS AS WELL AS THE DRIVER TO HOLD HIM IN AT THE STATION AND I DO NOT THINK THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT EVEN THEN HAD NOT ONE OF THE MEN HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND
953-130625-0023 TO PUT A HANDKERCHIEF OVER HIS NOSE AND TO LIGHT A BIT OF BROWN PAPER I TOOK MY TICKET AND MARCHED PROUDLY UP THE PLATFORM WITH MY CHEESES THE PEOPLE FALLING BACK RESPECTFULLY ON EITHER SIDE THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED
953-130625-0024 AND I HAD TO GET INTO A CARRIAGE WHERE THERE WERE ALREADY SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE ONE CRUSTY OLD GENTLEMAN OBJECTED BUT I GOT IN NOTWITHSTANDING AND PUTTING MY CHEESES UPON THE RACK SQUEEZED DOWN WITH A PLEASANT SMILE AND SAID IT WAS A WARM DAY
953-130625-0025 A FEW MOMENTS PASSED AND THEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN BEGAN TO FIDGET VERY CLOSE IN HERE HE SAID QUITE OPPRESSIVE SAID THE MAN NEXT HIM AND THEN THEY BOTH BEGAN SNIFFING AND AT THE THIRD SNIFF THEY CAUGHT IT RIGHT ON THE CHEST
953-130625-0026 AND ROSE UP WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND WENT OUT AND THEN A STOUT LADY GOT UP AND SAID IT WAS DISGRACEFUL THAT A RESPECTABLE MARRIED WOMAN SHOULD BE HARRIED ABOUT IN THIS WAY AND GATHERED UP A BAG AND EIGHT PARCELS AND WENT
953-130625-0027 THE REMAINING FOUR PASSENGERS SAT ON FOR A WHILE UNTIL A SOLEMN LOOKING MAN IN THE CORNER WHO FROM HIS DRESS AND GENERAL APPEARANCE SEEMED TO BELONG TO THE UNDERTAKER CLASS SAID IT PUT HIM IN MIND OF DEAD BABY
953-130625-0028 AND SAID I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THE CARRIAGE TO OURSELVES AND HE LAUGHED PLEASANTLY AND SAID THAT SOME PEOPLE MADE SUCH A FUSS OVER A LITTLE THING BUT EVEN HE GREW STRANGELY DEPRESSED AFTER WE HAD STARTED AND SO WHEN WE REACHED CREWE
953-130625-0029 I ASKED HIM TO COME AND HAVE A DRINK HE ACCEPTED AND WE FORCED OUR WAY INTO THE BUFFET WHERE WE YELLED AND STAMPED AND WAVED OUR UMBRELLAS FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THEN A YOUNG LADY CAME AND ASKED US IF WE WANTED ANYTHING
953-130625-0030 WHAT'S YOURS I SAID TURNING TO MY FRIEND I'LL HAVE HALF A CROWN'S WORTH OF BRANDY NEAT IF YOU PLEASE MISS HE RESPONDED AND HE WENT OFF QUIETLY AFTER HE HAD DRUNK IT AND GOT INTO ANOTHER CARRIAGE WHICH I THOUGHT MEAN
953-130625-0031 FROM CREWE I HAD THE COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF THOUGH THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED AS WE DREW UP AT THE DIFFERENT STATIONS THE PEOPLE SEEING MY EMPTY CARRIAGE WOULD RUSH FOR IT
953-130625-0032 ALL RIGHT TOM WE'LL GET IN HERE THEY WOULD SHOUT AND THEY WOULD RUN ALONG CARRYING HEAVY BAGS AND FIGHT ROUND THE DOOR TO GET IN FIRST AND ONE WOULD OPEN THE DOOR AND MOUNT THE STEPS AND STAGGER BACK INTO THE ARMS OF THE MAN BEHIND HIM
953-130625-0033 AND THEY WOULD ALL COME AND HAVE A SNIFF AND THEN DROOP OFF AND SQUEEZE INTO OTHER CARRIAGES OR PAY THE DIFFERENCE AND GO FIRST FROM EUSTON I TOOK THE CHEESES DOWN TO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE
953-130625-0034 WHEN HIS WIFE CAME INTO THE ROOM SHE SMELT ROUND FOR AN INSTANT THEN SHE SAID WHAT IS IT TELL ME THE WORST I SAID IT'S CHEESES TOM BOUGHT THEM IN LIVERPOOL AND ASKED ME TO BRING THEM UP WITH ME
953-130625-0035 AND I ADDED THAT I HOPED SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ME AND SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS SURE OF THAT BUT THAT SHE WOULD SPEAK TO TOM ABOUT IT WHEN HE CAME BACK MY FRIEND WAS DETAINED IN LIVERPOOL LONGER THAN HE EXPECTED
953-130625-0036 AND THREE DAYS LATER AS HE HADN'T RETURNED HOME HIS WIFE CALLED ON ME SHE SAID WHAT DID TOM SAY ABOUT THOSE CHEESES I REPLIED THAT HE HAD DIRECTED THEY WERE TO BE KEPT IN A MOIST PLACE AND THAT NOBODY WAS TO TOUCH THEM
953-130625-0037 SHE SAID NOBODY'S LIKELY TO TOUCH THEM HAD HE SMELT THEM I THOUGHT HE HAD AND ADDED THAT HE SEEMED GREATLY ATTACHED TO THEM YOU THINK HE WOULD BE UPSET SHE QUERIED
953-130625-0038 IF I GAVE A MAN A SOVEREIGN TO TAKE THEM AWAY AND BURY THEM I ANSWERED THAT I THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER SMILE AGAIN AN IDEA STRUCK HER SHE SAID DO YOU MIND KEEPING THEM FOR HIM LET ME SEND THEM ROUND TO YOU
953-130625-0039 MADAM I REPLIED FOR MYSELF I LIKE THE SMELL OF CHEESE AND THE JOURNEY THE OTHER DAY WITH THEM FROM LIVERPOOL I SHALL EVER LOOK BACK UPON AS A HAPPY ENDING TO A PLEASANT HOLIDAY BUT IN THIS WORLD WE MUST CONSIDER OTHERS
953-130625-0040 THE LADY UNDER WHOSE ROOF I HAVE THE HONOUR OF RESIDING IS A WIDOW AND FOR ALL I KNOW POSSIBLY AN ORPHAN TOO SHE HAS A STRONG I MAY SAY AN ELOQUENT OBJECTION TO BEING WHAT SHE TERMS PUT UPON
953-130625-0041 THE PRESENCE OF YOUR HUSBAND'S CHEESES IN HER HOUSE SHE WOULD I INSTINCTIVELY FEEL REGARD AS A PUT UPON AND IT SHALL NEVER BE SAID THAT I PUT UPON THE WIDOW AND THE ORPHAN VERY WELL THEN SAID MY FRIEND'S WIFE RISING
953-130625-0042 ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT I SHALL TAKE THE CHILDREN AND GO TO AN HOTEL UNTIL THOSE CHEESES ARE EATEN I DECLINE TO LIVE ANY LONGER IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH THEM SHE KEPT HER WORD LEAVING THE PLACE IN CHARGE OF THE CHARWOMAN
953-130625-0043 WHO WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD STAND THE SMELL REPLIED WHAT SMELL AND WHO WHEN TAKEN CLOSE TO THE CHEESES AND TOLD TO SNIFF HARD SAID SHE COULD DETECT A FAINT ODOUR OF MELONS
953-130625-0044 IT WAS ARGUED FROM THIS THAT LITTLE INJURY COULD RESULT TO THE WOMAN FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND SHE WAS LEFT THE HOTEL BILL CAME TO FIFTEEN GUINEAS AND MY FRIEND AFTER RECKONING EVERYTHING UP
953-130625-0045 HE SAID HE DEARLY LOVED A BIT OF CHEESE BUT IT WAS BEYOND HIS MEANS
953-130625-0046 BUT HAD TO FISH THEM OUT AGAIN AS THE BARGEMEN COMPLAINED THEY SAID IT MADE THEM FEEL QUITE FAINT AND AFTER THAT HE TOOK THEM ONE DARK NIGHT AND LEFT THEM IN THE PARISH MORTUARY BUT THE CORONER DISCOVERED THEM AND MADE A FEARFUL FUSS
953-130625-0047 MY FRIEND GOT RID OF THEM AT LAST
953-130625-0048 AND BURYING THEM ON THE BEACH IT GAINED THE PLACE QUITE A REPUTATION VISITORS SAID THEY HAD NEVER NOTICED BEFORE HOW STRONG THE AIR WAS AND WEAK CHESTED AND CONSUMPTIVE PEOPLE USED TO THRONG THERE FOR YEARS AFTERWARDS
953-130625-0049 FOND AS I AM OF CHEESE THEREFORE I HOLD THAT GEORGE WAS RIGHT IN DECLINING TO TAKE ANY WE SHAN'T WANT ANY TEA SAID GEORGE HARRIS'S FACE FELL AT THIS BUT WE'LL HAVE A GOOD ROUND SQUARE SLAP UP MEAL AT SEVEN
953-130625-0050 DINNER TEA AND SUPPER COMBINED HARRIS GREW MORE CHEERFUL GEORGE SUGGESTED MEAT AND FRUIT PIES COLD MEAT TOMATOES FRUIT AND GREEN STUFF FOR DRINK WE TOOK SOME WONDERFUL STICKY CONCOCTION OF HARRIS'S
953-130625-0051 WHICH YOU MIXED WITH WATER AND CALLED LEMONADE PLENTY OF TEA AND A BOTTLE OF WHISKY IN CASE AS GEORGE SAID WE GOT UPSET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT GEORGE HARPED TOO MUCH ON THE GETTING UPSET IDEA
953-130625-0052 IT SEEMED TO ME THE WRONG SPIRIT TO GO ABOUT THE TRIP IN BUT I'M GLAD WE TOOK THE WHISKY WE DIDN'T TAKE BEER OR WINE THEY ARE A MISTAKE UP THE RIVER THEY MAKE YOU FEEL SLEEPY AND HEAVY
953-130625-0053 AND LOOKING AT THE GIRLS IS ALL RIGHT ENOUGH BUT DON'T DRINK WHEN THE SUN IS BLAZING DOWN ON YOUR HEAD AND YOU'VE GOT HARD WORK TO DO
953-130625-0054 THE NEXT DAY WHICH WAS FRIDAY WE GOT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND MET IN THE EVENING TO PACK WE GOT A BIG GLADSTONE FOR THE CLOTHES AND A COUPLE OF HAMPERS FOR THE VICTUALS AND THE COOKING UTENSILS WE MOVED THE TABLE UP AGAINST THE WINDOW
953-130625-0055 PILED EVERYTHING IN A HEAP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND SAT ROUND AND LOOKED AT IT I SAID I'D PACK I RATHER PRIDE MYSELF ON MY PACKING PACKING IS ONE OF THOSE MANY THINGS THAT I FEEL I KNOW MORE ABOUT THAN ANY OTHER PERSON LIVING
953-130625-0056 IT SURPRISES ME MYSELF SOMETIMES HOW MANY OF THESE SUBJECTS THERE ARE I IMPRESSED THE FACT UPON GEORGE AND HARRIS AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY HAD BETTER LEAVE THE WHOLE MATTER ENTIRELY TO ME THEY FELL INTO THE SUGGESTION WITH A READINESS
953-130625-0057 THAT HAD SOMETHING UNCANNY ABOUT IT GEORGE PUT ON A PIPE AND SPREAD HIMSELF OVER THE EASY CHAIR AND HARRIS COCKED HIS LEGS ON THE TABLE AND LIT A CIGAR THIS WAS HARDLY WHAT I INTENDED WHAT I HAD MEANT OF COURSE
953-130625-0058 WAS THAT I SHOULD BOSS THE JOB AND THAT HARRIS AND GEORGE SHOULD POTTER ABOUT UNDER MY DIRECTIONS I PUSHING THEM ASIDE EVERY NOW AND THEN WITH OH YOU HERE LET ME DO IT THERE YOU ARE SIMPLE ENOUGH REALLY TEACHING THEM AS YOU MIGHT SAY
953-130625-0059 THEIR TAKING IT IN THE WAY THEY DID IRRITATED ME THERE IS NOTHING DOES IRRITATE ME MORE THAN SEEING OTHER PEOPLE SITTING ABOUT DOING NOTHING WHEN I'M WORKING I LIVED WITH A MAN ONCE WHO USED TO MAKE ME MAD THAT WAY
953-130625-0060 HE WOULD LOLL ON THE SOFA AND WATCH ME DOING THINGS BY THE HOUR TOGETHER FOLLOWING ME ROUND THE ROOM WITH HIS EYES WHEREVER I WENT HE SAID IT DID HIM REAL GOOD TO LOOK ON AT ME MESSING ABOUT
953-130625-0061 HE SAID IT MADE HIM FEEL THAT LIFE WAS NOT AN IDLE DREAM TO BE GAPED AND YAWNED THROUGH BUT A NOBLE TASK FULL OF DUTY AND STERN WORK HE SAID HE OFTEN WONDERED NOW HOW HE COULD HAVE GONE ON BEFORE HE MET ME
953-130625-0062 NEVER HAVING ANYBODY TO LOOK AT WHILE THEY WORKED NOW I'M NOT LIKE THAT I CAN'T SIT STILL AND SEE ANOTHER MAN SLAVING AND WORKING I WANT TO GET UP AND SUPERINTEND AND WALK ROUND WITH MY HANDS IN MY POCKETS
953-130625-0063 I CAN'T HELP IT HOWEVER I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING BUT STARTED THE PACKING IT SEEMED A LONGER JOB THAN I HAD THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE BUT I GOT THE BAG FINISHED AT LAST AND I SAT ON IT AND STRAPPED IT
953-130625-0064 AIN'T YOU GOING TO PUT THE BOOTS IN SAID HARRIS AND I LOOKED ROUND AND FOUND I HAD FORGOTTEN THEM THAT'S JUST LIKE HARRIS HE COULDN'T HAVE SAID A WORD UNTIL I'D GOT THE BAG SHUT AND STRAPPED OF COURSE AND GEORGE LAUGHED ONE OF THOSE IRRITATING SENSELESS
953-130625-0065 CHUCKLE HEADED CRACK JAWED LAUGHS OF HIS THEY DO MAKE ME SO WILD I OPENED THE BAG AND PACKED THE BOOTS IN AND THEN JUST AS I WAS GOING TO CLOSE IT A HORRIBLE IDEA OCCURRED TO ME
953-130625-0066 HAD I PACKED MY TOOTH BRUSH I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT I NEVER DO KNOW WHETHER I'VE PACKED MY TOOTH BRUSH MY TOOTH BRUSH IS A THING THAT HAUNTS ME WHEN I'M TRAVELLING AND MAKES MY LIFE A MISERY
953-130625-0067 I DREAM THAT I HAVEN'T PACKED IT AND WAKE UP IN A COLD PERSPIRATION AND GET OUT OF BED AND HUNT FOR IT AND IN THE MORNING I PACK IT BEFORE I HAVE USED IT AND HAVE TO UNPACK AGAIN TO GET IT AND IT IS ALWAYS THE LAST THING I TURN OUT OF THE BAG
953-130625-0068 AND THEN I REPACK AND FORGET IT AND HAVE TO RUSH UPSTAIRS FOR IT AT THE LAST MOMENT AND CARRY IT TO THE RAILWAY STATION
953-130625-0069 I COULD NOT FIND IT I RUMMAGED THE THINGS UP INTO MUCH THE SAME STATE THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE WORLD WAS CREATED AND WHEN CHAOS REIGNED OF COURSE I FOUND GEORGE'S AND HARRIS'S EIGHTEEN TIMES OVER BUT I COULDN'T FIND MY OWN
953-130625-0070 I PUT THE THINGS BACK ONE BY ONE AND HELD EVERYTHING UP AND SHOOK IT THEN I FOUND IT INSIDE A BOOT I REPACKED ONCE MORE WHEN I HAD FINISHED GEORGE ASKED IF THE SOAP WAS IN
953-130625-0071 I SAID I DIDN'T CARE A HANG WHETHER THE SOAP WAS IN OR WHETHER IT WASN'T AND I SLAMMED THE BAG TO AND STRAPPED IT AND FOUND THAT I HAD PACKED MY TOBACCO POUCH IN IT AND HAD TO RE OPEN IT
953-130625-0072 AND THEN THERE REMAINED THE HAMPERS TO DO HARRIS SAID THAT WE SHOULD BE WANTING TO START IN LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS TIME AND THOUGHT THAT HE AND GEORGE HAD BETTER DO THE REST AND I AGREED AND SAT DOWN AND THEY HAD A GO
953-130625-0073 THEY BEGAN IN A LIGHT HEARTED SPIRIT EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO SHOW ME HOW TO DO IT I MADE NO COMMENT I ONLY WAITED WHEN GEORGE IS HANGED HARRIS WILL BE THE WORST PACKER IN THIS WORLD
953-130625-0074 AND I LOOKED AT THE PILES OF PLATES AND CUPS AND KETTLES AND BOTTLES AND JARS AND PIES AND STOVES AND CAKES AND TOMATOES
953-130625-0075 AND FELT THAT THE THING WOULD SOON BECOME EXCITING IT DID THEY STARTED WITH BREAKING A CUP THAT WAS THE FIRST THING THEY DID
953-130625-0076 AND TO GET YOU INTERESTED THEN HARRIS PACKED THE STRAWBERRY JAM ON TOP OF A TOMATO AND SQUASHED IT AND THEY HAD TO PICK OUT THE TOMATO WITH A TEASPOON AND THEN IT WAS GEORGE'S TURN AND HE TROD ON THE BUTTER I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
953-130625-0077 BUT I CAME OVER AND SAT ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE AND WATCHED THEM IT IRRITATED THEM MORE THAN ANYTHING I COULD HAVE SAID I FELT THAT IT MADE THEM NERVOUS AND EXCITED AND THEY STEPPED ON THINGS AND PUT THINGS BEHIND THEM AND THEN COULDN'T FIND THEM WHEN THEY WANTED THEM
953-130625-0078 AND THEY PACKED THE PIES AT THE BOTTOM AND PUT HEAVY THINGS ON TOP AND SMASHED THE PIES IN THEY UPSET SALT OVER EVERYTHING AND AS FOR THE BUTTER I NEVER SAW TWO MEN DO MORE WITH ONE AND TWOPENCE WORTH OF BUTTER IN MY WHOLE LIFE THAN THEY DID
953-130625-0079 AFTER GEORGE HAD GOT IT OFF HIS SLIPPER THEY TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE KETTLE IT WOULDN'T GO IN AND WHAT WAS IN WOULDN'T COME OUT THEY DID SCRAPE IT OUT AT LAST AND PUT IT DOWN ON A CHAIR AND HARRIS SAT ON IT AND IT STUCK TO HIM
953-130625-0080 AND THEY WENT LOOKING FOR IT ALL OVER THE ROOM I'LL TAKE MY OATH I PUT IT DOWN ON THAT CHAIR SAID GEORGE STARING AT THE EMPTY SEAT I SAW YOU DO IT MYSELF NOT A MINUTE AGO SAID HARRIS THEN THEY STARTED ROUND THE ROOM AGAIN LOOKING FOR IT
953-130625-0081 AND THEN THEY MET AGAIN IN THE CENTRE AND STARED AT ONE ANOTHER MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING I EVER HEARD OF SAID GEORGE SO MYSTERIOUS SAID HARRIS THEN GEORGE GOT ROUND AT THE BACK OF HARRIS AND SAW IT
953-130625-0082 WHY HERE IT IS ALL THE TIME HE EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY WHERE CRIED HARRIS SPINNING ROUND STAND STILL CAN'T YOU ROARED GEORGE FLYING AFTER HIM AND THEY GOT IT OFF AND PACKED IT IN THE TEAPOT
953-130625-0083 MONTMORENCY WAS IN IT ALL OF COURSE MONTMORENCY'S AMBITION IN LIFE IS TO GET IN THE WAY AND BE SWORN AT IF HE CAN SQUIRM IN ANYWHERE WHERE HE PARTICULARLY IS NOT WANTED AND BE A PERFECT NUISANCE AND MAKE PEOPLE MAD
953-130625-0084 AND HAVE THINGS THROWN AT HIS HEAD THEN HE FEELS HIS DAY HAS NOT BEEN WASTED TO GET SOMEBODY TO STUMBLE OVER HIM AND CURSE HIM STEADILY FOR AN HOUR IS HIS HIGHEST AIM AND OBJECT AND WHEN HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS
953-130625-0085 HIS CONCEIT BECOMES QUITE UNBEARABLE HE CAME AND SAT DOWN ON THINGS JUST WHEN THEY WERE WANTED TO BE PACKED
953-130625-0086 WHENEVER HARRIS OR GEORGE REACHED OUT THEIR HAND FOR ANYTHING IT WAS HIS COLD DAMP NOSE THAT THEY WANTED HE PUT HIS LEG INTO THE JAM AND HE WORRIED THE TEASPOONS AND HE PRETENDED THAT THE LEMONS WERE RATS
953-130625-0087 AND GOT INTO THE HAMPER AND KILLED THREE OF THEM BEFORE HARRIS COULD LAND HIM WITH THE FRYING PAN HARRIS SAID I ENCOURAGED HIM I DIDN'T ENCOURAGE HIM A DOG LIKE THAT DON'T WANT ANY ENCOURAGEMENT IT'S THE NATURAL ORIGINAL SIN
953-130625-0088 THAT IS BORN IN HIM THAT MAKES HIM DO THINGS LIKE THAT
953-130625-0089 AND SAID HE HOPED NOTHING WOULD BE FOUND BROKEN
953-130625-0090 WHICH REFLECTION SEEMED TO COMFORT HIM HE ALSO SAID HE WAS READY FOR BED WE WERE ALL READY FOR BED HARRIS WAS TO SLEEP WITH US THAT NIGHT AND WE WENT UPSTAIRS WE TOSSED FOR BEDS AND HARRIS HAD TO SLEEP WITH ME HE SAID
953-130625-0091 DO YOU PREFER THE INSIDE OR THE OUTSIDE J I SAID I GENERALLY PREFERRED TO SLEEP INSIDE A BED HARRIS SAID IT WAS OLD GEORGE SAID WHAT TIME SHALL I WAKE YOU FELLOWS HARRIS SAID SEVEN
953-130625-0092 I SAID NO SIX BECAUSE I WANTED TO WRITE SOME LETTERS HARRIS AND I HAD A BIT OF A ROW OVER IT BUT AT LAST SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND SAID HALF PAST SIX
