7665-104978-0000 I NEEDED A POSITION NEEDED IT BADLY WHILE THE OTHERS
7665-104978-0001 SHE HAS PASSED ME BY MY HEART GOES DOWN DOWN WHEN SUDDENLY HER LOOK RETURNS AND SHE SINGLES ME OUT MISS SAUNDERS THEN I HAVE A WORD TO SAY TO YOU THERE IS A RUSTLE ABOUT ME
7665-104978-0002 FIVE DISAPPOINTED GIRLS SINK BACK INTO THEIR SEATS AS I QUICKLY RISE AND FOLLOW MISS DAVIES OUT IN THE HALL SHE FACED ME WITH THESE WORDS YOU ARE DISCREET AND YOU EVIDENTLY DESIRE A POSITION
7665-104978-0003 WELL AND GOOD IF NOT I SHALL EXPECT YOU TO FORGET ALL ABOUT HIM AND HIS ERRAND THE MOMENT YOU LEAVE HIS PRESENCE YOU UNDERSTAND ME I THINK SO I REPLIED MEETING HER STEADY LOOK WITH ONE EQUALLY COMPOSED PART OF MY STRENGTH
7665-104978-0004 AND I THINK I HAVE SOME STRENGTH LIES IN THE FACT THAT I AM QUIETEST WHEN MOST DEEPLY ROUSED I AM NOT TO TALK WHATEVER THE OUTCOME NOT EVEN TO ME SHE EMPHASIZED STIRRED STILL FURTHER AND THEREFORE OUTWARDLY EVEN MORE CALM THAN BEFORE
7665-104978-0005 I STOPPED HER AS SHE WAS MOVING ON AND VENTURED A SINGLE QUERY THIS POSITION INVOLVING SECRECY IS IT ONE YOU WOULD ADVISE ME TO TAKE EVEN IF I DID NOT STAND IN NEED OF IT SO BADLY YES
7665-104978-0006 THANK YOU WAS MY ABRUPT BUT GRATEFUL REJOINDER AND OBEYING HER SILENT GESTURE I OPENED THE DOOR OF THE SITTING ROOM AND PASSED IN
7665-104978-0007 THE MAN WHOSE MISSION IT WAS TO SEEK MY AID WAS ONE TO INSPIRE CONFIDENCE AND RESPECT HE WAS ALSO A HANDSOME MAN OR NO I WILL NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT
7665-104978-0008 HE WAS ONLY ONE IN WHOM THE LINES OF FORM AND VISAGE WERE FINE ENOUGH NOT TO INTERFERE WITH THE IMPRESSION MADE BY HIS STRONG NATURE AND INTENSE VITALITY A MAN TO SWAY WOMEN AND ALSO QUITE CAPABLE OF MOVING MEN
7665-104978-0009 THIS WAS EVIDENT AT A GLANCE BUT A MAN UNDER A CLOUD JUST AT PRESENT A VERY HEAVY CLOUD WHICH BOTH IRKED AND PERPLEXED HIM
7665-104978-0010 HE SURVEYED ME CLOSELY FOR AN INSTANT BEFORE SPEAKING
7665-104978-0011 AND I WAS SURE I CAUGHT THE NOTE OF HOPE IN HIS VOICE AS HE COURTEOUSLY REMARKED YOU ARE SEEKING A PLACE YOUNG LADY DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FILL THE ONE I HAVE TO OFFER IT HAS ITS DIFFICULTIES BUT IT IS NOT AN ONEROUS ONE
7665-104978-0012 IT IS THAT OF COMPANION TO MY WIFE I BOWED POSSIBLY I SMILED I DO SMILE SOMETIMES WHEN A RAY OF REAL SUNSHINE DARTS ACROSS MY PATHWAY
7665-104978-0013 I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO TRY SUCH A SITUATION I REPLIED A LOOK OF RELIEF SO VIVID THAT IT STARTLED ME ALTERED AT ONCE THE WHOLE CHARACTER OF HIS COUNTENANCE
7665-104978-0014 AND PERCEIVING HOW INTENSE WAS THE POWER AND FASCINATION UNDERLYING HIS QUIET EXTERIOR I ASKED MYSELF WHO AND WHAT THIS MAN WAS NO ORDINARY PERSONAGE I WAS SURE BUT WHO
7665-104978-0015 HAD MISS DAVIES PURPOSELY WITHHELD HIS NAME I BEGAN TO THINK SO I HAVE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE I WAS PROCEEDING
7665-104978-0016 IT IS NOT EXPERIENCE WHICH IS SO MUCH NEEDED AS DISCRETION AGAIN THAT WORD THE CASE IS NOT A COMMON ONE OR RATHER HE CAUGHT HIMSELF UP QUICKLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT MY WIFE IS WELL BUT
7665-104978-0017 SHE IS NOT HAPPY SHE IS VERY UNHAPPY DEEPLY UNACCOUNTABLY SO AND I DO NOT KNOW WHY ANXIOUS TO WATCH THE EFFECT OF THESE WORDS HE PAUSED A MOMENT THEN ADDED FERVENTLY WOULD TO GOD I DID
7665-104978-0018 THE MEANING THE DEEP MEANING IN HIS TONE IF NOT IN THE ADJURATION ITSELF WAS UNDENIABLE BUT MY OLD HABIT OF SELF CONTROL STOOD ME IN GOOD STEAD AND I REMAINED SILENT AND WATCHFUL
7665-104978-0019 WEIGHING EVERY LOOK AND WORD A WEEK AGO SHE WAS THE LIGHTEST HEARTED WOMAN IN TOWN THE HAPPIEST WIFE THE MERRIEST MOTHER TO DAY SHE IS A MERE WRECK OF HER FORMER SELF PALLID DRAWN ALMOST SPEECHLESS
7665-104978-0020 YET SHE IS NOT ILL SHE WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE TO AN ACHE OR A PAIN WILL NOT EVEN ADMIT THAT ANY CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN HER BUT YOU HAVE ONLY TO SEE HER AND I AM AS IGNORANT OF THE CAUSE OF IT ALL
7665-104978-0021 AS YOU ARE HE BURST OUT STILL I REMAINED SILENT WAITING WATCHFUL I HAVE TALKED WITH HER PHYSICIAN HE SAYS THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUS THE MATTER WITH HER BUT HE CAN NOT HELP HER
7665-104978-0022 AS IF THAT HAD NOT BEEN MY FIRST CARE I HAVE ALSO CONSULTED HER MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS ALL WHO KNOW HER WELL BUT THEY CAN GIVE ME NO CLUE TO HER DISTRESS THEY SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN HER BUT CAN NOT TELL THE CAUSE
7665-104978-0023 AND I AM OBLIGED TO GO AWAY AND LEAVE HER IN THIS STATE FOR TWO WEEKS THREE WEEKS NOW
7665-104978-0024 BUT SHE WILL NEITHER CONSENT TO LEAVE HOME WITHOUT ME NOR TO INTERRUPT MY PLANS IN ORDER THAT I MAY ACCOMPANY HER MISS DAVIES HAS NOT TOLD ME YOUR NAME I MADE BOLD TO INTERPOLATE
7665-104978-0025 HE STARED SHOOK HIMSELF TOGETHER AND QUIETLY REMARKED I AM HENRY PACKARD THE CITY'S MAYOR AND NOT ONLY THAT THE RUNNING CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR I KNEW HIM WELL BY NAME EVEN IF I DID NOT KNOW OR
7665-104978-0026 RATHER HAD NOT RECOGNIZED HIS FACE I BEG PARDON I SOMEWHAT TREMULOUSLY BEGAN BUT HE WAVED THE COMING APOLOGY ASIDE AS EASILY AS HE HAD MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT INGRATIATION IN FACT
7665-104978-0027 HE APPEARED TO BE IMPATIENT OF EVERY UNNECESSARY WORD THIS I COULD IN A DIM SORT OF WAY UNDERSTAND HE WAS AT THE CRISIS OF HIS FATE AND SO WAS HIS PARTY
7665-104978-0028 FOR SEVERAL YEARS A STRUGGLE HAD GONE ON BETWEEN THE TWO NEARLY MATCHED ELEMENTS IN THIS WESTERN CITY WHICH SO FAR HAD RESULTED IN SECURING HIM TWO TERMS OF OFFICE POSSIBLY BECAUSE HIS CHARACTER APPEALED TO MEN OF ALL GRADES AND VARYING CONVICTIONS
7665-104978-0029 BUT THE OPPOSITE PARTY WAS STRONG IN THE STATE AND THE QUESTION WHETHER HE COULD CARRY HIS TICKET AGAINST SUCH ODDS AND THUS GIVE HOPE TO HIS PARTY IN THE COMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS ONE YET TO BE TESTED FORCEFUL AS A SPEAKER
7665-104978-0030 IGNORANT AS I NECESSARILY WAS OF THE EXIGENCIES OF SUCH A CAMPAIGN I KNEW THAT NOT ONLY HIS OWN AMBITION
7665-104978-0031 IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE AND NOW THREE WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION WHILE EVERY OPPOSING FORCE WAS COMING TO THE SURFACE THIS TROUBLE HAD COME UPON HIM A MYSTERY IN HIS HOME AND THREATENED DEATH IN HIS HEART
7665-104978-0032 FOR HE LOVED HIS WIFE THAT WAS APPARENT TO ME FROM THE FIRST LOVED HER TO IDOLATRY AS SUCH MEN SOMETIMES DO LOVE OFTEN TO THEIR OWN UNDOING ALL THIS THE THOUGHT OF AN INSTANT
7665-104978-0033 MEANWHILE HE HAD BEEN STUDYING ME WELL YOU UNDERSTAND MY POSITION HE COMMENTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT
7665-104978-0034 WHILE SHE WITH AN EFFORT HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER MISS SAUNDERS I PUT IN MISS SAUNDERS I CAN NOT LEAVE HER ALONE IN THE HOUSE SOME ONE MUST BE THERE TO GUARD AND WATCH
7665-104978-0035 HAS SHE NO MOTHER I SUGGESTED IN THE PAUSE HE MADE SHE HAS NO LIVING RELATIVES AND MINE ARE UNCONGENIAL TO HER THIS TO SAVE ANOTHER QUESTION I UNDERSTOOD HIM PERFECTLY
7665-104978-0036 HE PURSUED DECISIVELY SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT TO IT NOR CAN I ASK ANY OF HER FRIENDS THAT SHE DOES NOT WISH EITHER BUT I CAN HIRE A COMPANION TO THAT SHE HAS ALREADY CONSENTED
7665-104978-0037 THAT SHE WILL REGARD AS A KINDNESS IF THE LADY CHOSEN SHOULD PROVE TO BE ONE OF THOSE RARE BEINGS WHO CARRY COMFORT IN THEIR LOOKS WITHOUT OBTRUDING THEIR SERVICES OR DISPLAYING THE EXTENT OF THEIR INTEREST
7665-104978-0038 YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER MAY BE MORE GRATEFUL THAN THAT OF A FRIEND APPARENTLY MY WIFE FEELS HERSELF SO PLACED NOW HERE HIS EYES AGAIN READ MY FACE AN ORDEAL OUT OF WHICH I CAME TRIUMPHANT
7665-104978-0039 THE SATISFACTION HE EVINCED RIGHTLY INDICATED HIS MIND WILL YOU ACCEPT THE POSITION HE ASKED WE HAVE ONE LITTLE CHILD YOU WILL HAVE NO CHARGE OF HER SAVE AS YOU MAY WISH TO MAKE USE OF HER IN REACHING THE MOTHER
7665-104978-0040 THE HINT CONVEYED IN THE LAST PHRASE GAVE ME COURAGE TO SAY YOU WISH ME TO REACH HER WITH COMFORT SAID HE AND IF IN DOING SO I LEARN HER TROUBLE YOU WILL WIN MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE
7665-104978-0041 BY TELLING IT TO ONE WHO WOULD GIVE TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO ASSUAGE IT MY HEAD ROSE I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT MY NEXT STEP MUST STRIKE SOLID GROUND IN OTHER WORDS TO BE QUITE HONEST
7665-104978-0042 YOU WISH ME TO LEARN HER TROUBLE IF I CAN I BELIEVE YOU CAN BE TRUSTED TO DO SO AND THEN TO REVEAL IT TO YOU IF YOUR SENSE OF DUTY PERMITS WHICH I THINK IT WILL
7665-104978-0043 I MIGHT HAVE UTTERED IN REPLY A SPY'S DUTY BUT THE HIGH MINDEDNESS OF HIS LOOK FORBADE WHATEVER HUMILIATION HIS WISHES PUT UPON ME
7665-104978-0044 THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF THE UPRIGHTNESS OF HIS MOTIVES REGARDING HIS WIFE I VENTURED ONE MORE QUESTION HOW FAR SHALL I FEEL MYSELF AT LIBERTY TO GO IN THIS ATTEMPT
7665-104978-0045 AS FAR AS YOUR JUDGMENT APPROVES AND CIRCUMSTANCES SEEM TO WARRANT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL COME UPON NOTHING DISHONORABLE TO HER OR DETRIMENTAL TO OUR RELATIONS AS HUSBAND AND WIFE IN THIS SECRET
7665-104978-0046 WHICH IS DESTROYING OUR HAPPINESS HER AFFECTION FOR ME IS UNDOUBTED BUT SOMETHING GOD KNOWS WHAT HAS LAID WASTE HER LIFE TO FIND AND ANNIHILATE THAT SOMETHING IS MY FIRST AND FOREMOST DUTY
7665-104978-0047 THAT IS WHY I HAVE CALLED IN HELP THAT IS WHY I HAVE CALLED YOU IN THE EMPHASIS WAS DELICATELY BUT SINCERELY GIVEN IT STRUCK MY HEART AND ENTERED IT
7665-104978-0048 IF SO IT WAS BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT A WOMAN LIKE MYSELF WORKS BETTER WHEN HER FEELINGS ARE ROUSED ANSWERING WITH A SMILE I WAITED PATIENTLY WHILE HE TALKED TERMS AND OTHER EQUALLY NECESSARY DETAILS
7665-104978-0049 THEN DROPPING ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS SOMEWHAT IN HIS OWN GRAND MANNER I MADE THIS REMARK IF YOUR WIFE LIKES ME WHICH VERY POSSIBLY SHE MAY FAIL TO DO
7665-104978-0050 WILL YOU SEE THAT AN OPPORTUNITY IS GIVEN ME FOR DOING THIS HIS ASSENT WAS AS FRANK AS ALL THE REST AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AS HE PASSED OUT I HEARD HIM REMARK TO MISS DAVIES I EXPECT MISS SAUNDERS AT MY HOUSE BEFORE NIGHTFALL
