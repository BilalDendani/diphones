6099-69550-0000 CHAPTER TWO IN THE SPRINGTIME A JAPANESE HOUSE IS A FAIRY LIKE THING WITH ONLY TOP AND BOTTOM OF STRAW AND A FEW UPHOLDING POSTS TO GIVE IT A LOOK OF SUBSTANCE
6099-69550-0001 YUKI CHAN'S HOUSE WAS TYPICAL THE PAPER SCREENS WERE CAREFULLY PUT AWAY DURING THE DAY THAT THE BREEZES MIGHT PLAY UNOBSTRUCTED THROUGH THE HOUSE
6099-69550-0002 AT NIGHT THE HEAVY WOODEN DOORS WERE FITTED INTO GROOVES AND SERVED NOT ONLY TO KEEP OUT THE NIGHT AIR BUT ALSO THE EVIL SPIRITS THAT COME ABROAD WHEN THE GREAT SUN CEASES WATCHING
6099-69550-0003 YUKI CHAN FIRST LEARNED TO KNOW HER FACE IN ITS REFLECTIONS AND ALAS BY THE SAME METHOD HAD LEARNED THE SAUCY FASCINATION OF STICKING OUT HER SMALL PINK TONGUE
6099-69550-0004 ON THE SIDE OF THE PORCH TOWARD THE PLUM TREE THE CHILD FOUND HER FATHER AND MOTHER WAITING THE TWO OLD PEOPLE SAT ON GAY CUSHIONS WITH HANDS FOLDED AND FEET CROSSED
6099-69550-0005 THEIR FESTAL ATTIRE BORE THE MARKS OF A ONCE CARELESS LUXURY BUT NOW SHABBINESS TRIED TO HIDE ITSELF UNDER THE BRAVERY OF TINSEL WHERE ONCE HAD BEEN PURE GOLD
6099-69550-0006 EACH YEAR THE STRUGGLE OF OBSOLETE METHODS OF BUSINESS AND THE INTRICACIES OF PROGRESS PLOWED THE FURROWS A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE MAN'S FACE AND WHEN HIS EYES
6099-69550-0007 THAT IN YOUTH HAD BLAZED WITH AMBITION GREW WISTFUL AND TROUBLED HE DROPPED THEM THAT HIS WIFE MIGHT NOT SEE
6099-69550-0008 BUT WHAT SILENCE COULD HIDE FROM THIS FRAIL WOMAN ANY MOOD OF THE MAN SHE HAD SERVED WITH MIND AND BODY AND SOUL THESE MANY YEARS WHEN SHE CAME TO HIM AS A SHY BRIDE ON TRIAL
6099-69550-0009 SHE KNEW NO SUCH WORD AS LOVE DUTY WAS HER ENTIRE VOCABULARY AND SHE ASKED NOTHING AND GAVE ALL MANY LITTLE SOULS HAD COME TO HER WITH HANDS ALL CRIMPED AND PINK
6099-69550-0010 LIKE NEW BLOWN CHERRY LEAVES ONLY TO CLOSE THEIR EYES AND PASS OUT TO THE GOOD GOD JIZO WHO IS ALWAYS WAITING TO HELP LITTLE CHILDREN ACROSS THE RIVER OF DEATH IN YEARS GONE BY
6099-69550-0011 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT SLEEP HAD FLOWN BEFORE THE TERROR THAT ANOTHER WOMAN WOULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE THAT THE FAMILY NAME MIGHT NOT DIE OUT SILENTLY SHE WOULD SLIP OUT TO THE LITTLE SHRINE
6099-69550-0012 AND POUR OUT PASSIONATE WORDS OF PRAYER THAT JUST ONE LITTLE SOUL MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO LIVE NO MATTER HOW LONG THE NIGHT NOR HOW BITTER THE STRUGGLE MORNING ALWAYS FOUND HER BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL
6099-69550-0013 ACQUIESCING IN HIS MOST TRIVIAL STATEMENTS SHE PLANNED THAT NO SLIGHTEST GAP IN THE DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENT SHOULD SUGGEST ITSELF TO HIM THE WOMAN WORKED AND PRAYED AND WAITED
6099-69550-0014 HAND IN HAND WITH YUKI CHAN CAME LOVE AND BOUND THE HEARTS OF THE MAN AND WOMAN WITH TIES OF A DESIRE FULFILLED FROM THAT TIME TO THIS LOVE HAD PREVAILED
6099-69550-0015 AND AS YUKI CHAN CLIMBED ON THE PORCH BESMIRCHING ITS SHINING SURFACE WITH HER MUDDY LITTLE FEET THAT HAD BEEN GUILTLESS OF SANDALS ALL DAY THE FACES OF THE TWO OLD PEOPLE LIGHTED UP WITH SUDDEN JOY
6099-69550-0016 YUKI CHAN LOOKED RUEFULLY AT THE MUDDY PRINTS SHE HAD MADE AND REALIZED THAT SHE HAD BEEN A MOST IMPOLITE LITTLE GIRL REMEMBERING HER RECENT RESOLVE
6099-69550-0017 SHE SOUGHT THE EYES IN WHICH SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY LIGHT FOR HER SAVE THAT OF LOVE SHE DREW CLOSE AND REACHING DOWN TOOK HER MOTHER'S HAND HARD AND CRACKED BY LABOR
6099-69550-0018 AND LAYING HER CHEEK AGAINST IT SAID WITH A VOICE SURE OF FORGIVENESS AND SWEET DESIRE FOR ATONEMENT GO MEN NASAI THE MOTHER WITH A COURTLY BUT PLAYFUL AIR
6099-69550-0019 GRANTED HER PARDON WITH A LOW SALUTATION THEN WITH A RUSH OF AFFECTION THAT NO CONVENTION COULD STEM SHE FOLDED THE CHILD TO HER HEART AND LIVED ANOTHER MOMENT OF SUPREME JOY
6099-69550-0020 THE FATHER SAT BY MAKING NO COMMENT HIS EYES BRIGHT AND TWINKLING THEN HE SUGGESTED THAT THEIR MAJESTIES THE DOLLS HAD BEEN WAITING LONG ON THE SHELF
6099-69550-0021 WAS IT NOT TIME THEY WERE RECEIVING A VISIT THE YEARS OF TOIL WERE TELLING ON BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER
6099-69550-0022 AND NOW AS THEY EACH TOOK ONE OF HER HANDS TO GO IN TO SEE THE DOLLS THEY WERE SO GAY THAT THE CHILD SUGGESTED THAT INSTEAD OF WALKING THEY SHOULD DO THE NEW ONE TWO THREE HOP SHE HAD LEARNED AT THE KINDERGARTEN
6099-69550-0023 IT WAS UNHEARD OF CONDUCT BUT IT WAS FOR YUKI CHAN AND FATHER AND MOTHER STUMPED ALONG CHEERED ON BY THE SMALL GIRL WHO WAS TRYING TO KEEP TIME
6099-69550-0024 BUT WAS BREATHLESS THROUGH SHEER EXCESS OF HAPPINESS THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE ROOM TO IMPEDE THEIR PROGRESS NO CHAIRS WITH TREACHEROUS LEGS TO TRIP OVER NO BEDS NOR TABLES WITH SHARP CORNERS
6099-69550-0025 NOTHING WHATEVER BUT THE MATTING SOFT AND THICK WHERE YUKI CHAN HAD PRACTISED ALL THE GYMNASTICS OF CHILDHOOD UNBRUISED AND UNHARMED HALF SKIPPING HALF HOPPING
6099-69550-0026 AND WHOLLY UNDONE WITH LAUGHTER AND EXERTION THE THREE AT LAST REACHED THE PLACE WHERE FOR SIX YEARS OFFERINGS HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE GIFT OF THE CHILD WHO STOOD TO THESE TWO FOR LOVE
6099-69550-0027 ARRANGED IN THE BEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE ON FIVE LONG RED COVERED SHELVES
6099-69550-0028 BIG DOLLS AND LITTLE DOLLS THIN ONES AND FAT ONES EACH ONE TO REPRESENT SOME ROYAL MAN OR WOMAN OF THE LONG AGO AND DRESSED IN A FASHION OF A TIME ALMOST FORGOTTEN
6099-69550-0029 THERE WAS JIMMU TENNO THE FIRST REAL EMPEROR HIS HAIR WAS DONE IN A CURIOUS FASHION AND HIS DRESS WAS OF A WONDERFUL BROCADE WHILE HIS HANDS CLASPED TWO FIERCE LOOKING SWORDS
6099-69550-0030 THERE WAS JINGO TOO WHO HAD WON FAME AND LASTING HONOR BY HER WONDERFUL FIGHTING AND WAS SO GREAT SHE HAD TO SIT BY THE EMPERORS AND LOOK DOWN ON THE OTHER EMPRESSES SUCH A LOT OF THEM
6099-69550-0031 OTHERS THE MORE QUICKLY FORGOTTEN THE BETTER YUKI CHAN KNEW THEM ALL BY HEART AND SHE LINGERED BEFORE THOSE SHE LIKED AND QUICKLY PASSED THOSE SHE DID NOT CARE FOR
6099-69550-0032 STILL IT WAS WELL TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HANDLING THEM SHE MIGHT BE TURNED INTO A LIZARD OR A SNAKE JUST AS THE OLD LODGE KEEPER HAD SAID BUT HER DELIGHT
6099-69550-0033 WAS IN THE MINIATURE TOILET ARTICLES OF SOLID SILVER COSTLY GOLD LACQUER AND PORCELAIN SO TINY SO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THEY MUST HAVE MEANT THE EYESIGHT OF SOME WORKMAN
6099-69550-0034 ONLY TOO GLAD TO SHUT OUT THE SUNLIGHT FOREVER IF HE MIGHT PRODUCE JUST ONE PERFECT THING THE THINGS HOWEVER THAT MADE YUKI CHAN CLAP HER HANDS
6099-69550-0035 SO BOW LEGGED THAT THEIR CURVES FORMED A BIG ROUND O YUKI CHAN MADE HER RED LIPS INTO THE SAME SHAPE AND CALLED HER MOTHER TO LOOK
6099-69550-0036 SHE PRETENDED TO FEED THE DOLLS WITH REAL FOOD AND WINE AND ACTUALLY PLAYED WITH THE FIVE COURT MUSICIANS BECAUSE THEY WERE PARTLY SERVANTS AND IT DID NOT MATTER HER TONGUE RAN IN CEASELESS CHATTER
6099-69550-0037 HER FATHER AND MOTHER HOVERED AROUND HER REPEATING THE HISTORY OF ALL THOSE WONDERFUL PEOPLE YUKI CHAN LISTENED VERY LITTLE SO CONCERNED WAS SHE WITH HER OWN COMMENTS
6099-69550-0038 UNTIL SHE HAPPENED TO SEE AN ANXIOUS LOOK CREEP INTO HER MOTHER'S EYES IT WAS SOMETHING EVERY LITTLE GIRL MUST KNOW AND IF YUKI CHAN'S HONORABLE EARS REFUSED TO OPEN HOW WOULD SHE LEARN
6099-69550-0039 THE SAILS SKIMMED HOMEWARD ON A SILVER SEA AS THE WEST COVERED ITS ROSY PINK IN A VEIL OF DEEPEST BLUE THE YOUNG BIRDS IN THE OLD PLUM TREE
6099-69550-0040 WITHIN THE HOUSE YUKI CHAN STILL DRESSED LAY ON THE FLOOR WEARY WITH THE WONDERS OF THE DAY HER MOTHER TOOK FROM A SMALL INCLOSURE BENEATH A SHELF
6099-69550-0041 MANY SOFT COMFORTS WITH WHICH SHE ARRANGED THE CHILD'S BED YUKI CHAN TALKING ALL THE TIME IN A LOW MONOTONE TRIED TO UNRAVEL A TANGLE IN HER MIND OF BIRDS AND CATS AND DOLLS
6099-69550-0042 IT WAS ALL GETTING UNMANAGEABLE AND VERY HAZY WHEN HER MOTHER GATHERED HER INTO HER ARMS AND QUICKLY CASTING ASIDE HER TWO GARMENTS LAID HER GENTLY IN A BATH OF CARESSING WARMTH
6099-69550-0043 A MOMENT MORE AND THE LITTLE MAIDEN LAY LIKE A ROSE LEAF IN HER BED THE NIGHT LAMP MADE SHADOWY GHOSTS OF ALL IT TOUCHED AND ONE GLEAM OF LIGHT ESCAPING THE PAPER SHADE HUNG
6099-69550-0044 LIKE AN AUREOLE ABOVE THE HEAD OF YUKI CHAN'S MOTHER AS SHE KNELT WITH CLASPED HANDS BEFORE THE BUDDHA ON THE SHELF HER MOVING LIPS HAD ONLY ONE REFRAIN THE CHILD THE CHILD
6099-69550-0045 THE CHILD YUKI CHAN WATCHED THE PLAY OF THE LIGHT IN THE HALF DARK ROOM WHAT FUNNY THINGS THOSE SHADOWS MADE AND STRANGELY ENOUGH
6099-69550-0046 AND HER MOTHER SAT BY AND KEPT TIME WITH HER HAND AS SHE CHANTED RATHER THAN SANG SLEEP LITTLE ONE SLEEP THE SPARROWS ARE NODDING
