2194-141248-0000 ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS WAS RUNNING AND SCREAMING THE MAGTER KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND BEAT HIM INTO SILENCE SEEING THIS THE OTHER TWO MEN RETURNED TO WORK WITH SHAKING HANDS EVEN IF ALL LIFE ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET WAS DEAD
2194-141248-0001 THIS WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE MAGTER THEY WOULD GO AHEAD AS PLANNED WITHOUT EMOTION OR IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO ALTER THEIR SET COURSE AS THE TECHNICIANS WORKED THEIR ATTITUDE CHANGED FROM SHOCKED NUMBNESS TO ANGER
2194-141248-0002 RIGHT AND WRONG WERE FORGOTTEN THEY HAD BEEN KILLED THE INVISIBLE DEATH OF RADIATION MUST ALREADY BE PENETRATING INTO THE CAVES BUT THEY ALSO HAD THE CHANCE FOR VENGEANCE SWIFTLY THEY BROUGHT THEIR WORK TO COMPLETION
2194-141248-0003 WHAT ARE THOSE OFFWORLDERS DOING ULV ASKED BRION STIRRED FROM HIS LETHARGY OF DEFEAT AND LOOKED ACROSS THE CAVERN FLOOR THE MEN HAD A WHEELED HANDTRUCK AND WERE ROLLING ONE OF THE ATOMIC WARHEADS ONTO IT
2194-141248-0004 THEY PUSHED IT OVER TO THE LATTICEWORK OF THE JUMP FIELD THEY ARE GOING TO BOMB NYJORD NOW JUST AS NYJORD BOMBED DIS THAT MACHINE WILL HURL THE BOMBS IN A SPECIAL WAY TO THE OTHER PLANET
2194-141248-0005 HE HAD HIS DEADLY BLOWGUN IN HIS HAND AND HIS FACE WAS AN EXPRESSIONLESS MASK BRION ALMOST SMILED AT THE IRONY OF THE SITUATION IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING HE HAD DONE TO PREVENT IT NYJORD HAD DROPPED THE BOMBS
2194-141248-0006 AND THIS ACT ALONE MAY HAVE DESTROYED THEIR OWN PLANET BRION HAD IT WITHIN HIS POWER NOW TO STOP THE LAUNCHING IN THE CAVERN SHOULD HE SHOULD HE SAVE THE LIVES OF HIS KILLERS
2194-141248-0007 OR SHOULD HE PRACTICE THE ANCIENT BLOOD OATH THAT HAD ECHOED AND DESTROYED DOWN THROUGH THE AGES AN EYE FOR AN EYE A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH IT WOULD BE SO SIMPLE HE LITERALLY HAD TO DO NOTHING THE SCORE WOULD BE EVEN
2194-141248-0008 AND HIS AND THE DISANS DEATH AVENGED
2194-141248-0009 OR HAD HE MISREAD THE DISAN ENTIRELY
2194-141248-0010 HOW LARGE WAS MANKIND'S SENSE OF OBLIGATION THE CAVEMAN FIRST HAD THIS FEELING FOR HIS MATE THEN FOR HIS FAMILY IT GREW UNTIL MEN FOUGHT AND DIED FOR THE ABSTRACT IDEAS OF CITIES AND NATIONS
2194-141248-0011 THEN FOR WHOLE PLANETS WOULD THE TIME EVER COME WHEN MEN MIGHT REALIZE THAT THE OBLIGATION SHOULD BE TO THE LARGEST AND MOST ENCOMPASSING REALITY OF ALL MANKIND AND BEYOND THAT TO LIFE OF ALL KINDS
2194-141248-0012 WHEN HE POSED THE QUESTION TO HIMSELF IN THIS WAY HE FOUND THAT IT STATED CLEARLY ITS INHERENT ANSWER HE PULLED HIS GUN OUT
2194-141248-0013 NYJORD IS MEDVIRK ULV SAID RAISING HIS BLOWGUN AND SENDING A DART ACROSS THE CAVERN IT STRUCK ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS WHO GASPED AND FELL TO THE FLOOR BRION'S SHOTS CRASHED INTO THE CONTROL BOARD SHORTING AND DESTROYING IT
2194-141248-0014 REMOVING THE MENACE TO NYJORD FOR ALL TIME MEDVIRK ULV HAD SAID A LIFE FORM THAT COOPERATES AND AIDS OTHER LIFE FORMS IT MAY KILL IN SELF DEFENSE BUT IT IS ESSENTIALLY NOT A KILLER OR DESTROYER
2194-141248-0015 HE HAD KILLED THE MAGTER WHO WERE HIS OWN PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WERE UMEDVIRK AGAINST LIFE AND HE HAD SAVED HIS ENEMIES BECAUSE THEY WERE MEDVIRK WITH THIS REALIZATION CAME THE PAINFUL KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PLANET AND THE PEOPLE THAT HAD PRODUCED THIS UNDERSTANDING
2194-141248-0016 TO ULV THE DECISION WAS MUCH EASIER HE WAS SIMPLY KILLING UMEDVIRK A BELIEVER IN LIFE HE DESTROYED THE ANTI LIFE THEY RETREATED INTO THE DARKNESS STILL FIRING
2194-141248-0017 THE MAGTER HAD LIGHTS AND ION RIFLES AND WERE RIGHT BEHIND THEM KNOWING THE CAVERNS BETTER THAN THE MEN THEY CHASED THE PURSUERS CIRCLED BRION SAW LIGHTS AHEAD AND DRAGGED ULV TO A STOP
2194-141248-0018 THERE IS A CAVE WITH ONLY ONE ENTRANCE AND THAT IS VERY NARROW LET'S GO RUNNING AS SILENTLY AS THEY COULD IN THE DARKNESS THEY REACHED THE DEADEND CAVERN WITHOUT BEING SEEN
2194-141248-0019 WHAT NOISE THEY MADE WAS LOST IN OTHER FOOTSTEPS THAT SOUNDED AND ECHOED THROUGH THE CONNECTING CAVES ONCE INSIDE THEY FOUND COVER BEHIND A RIDGE AND WAITED THE END WAS CERTAIN THE MAGTER RAN SWIFTLY INTO THEIR CAVE
2194-141248-0020 FLASHING HIS LIGHT INTO ALL THE PLACES OF CONCEALMENT THE BEAM PASSED OVER THE TWO HIDDEN MEN AND AT THE SAME INSTANT BRION FIRED THE SHOT BOOMED LOUDLY AS THE MAGTER FELL
2194-141248-0021 BEFORE ANYONE ELSE CAME INTO THE CAVE BRION RAN OVER AND GRABBED THE STILL FUNCTIONING LIGHT PROPPING IT ON THE ROCKS SO IT SHONE ON THE ENTRANCE
2194-141248-0022 IT WAS NOT LONG IN COMING TWO MAGTER RUSHED IN AND DIED MORE WERE OUTSIDE BRION KNEW AND HE WONDERED HOW LONG IT WOULD BE BEFORE THEY REMEMBERED THE GRENADES AND ROLLED ONE INTO THEIR SHELTER
2194-141248-0023 AN INDISTINCT MURMUR SOUNDED OUTSIDE AND SHARP EXPLOSIONS IN THEIR HIDING PLACE BRION AND ULV CROUCHED LOW AND WONDERED WHY THE ATTACK DIDN'T COME THEN ONE OF THE MAGTER CAME IN THE ENTRANCE
2194-141248-0024 THE MAN HAD BACKED IN FIRING BEHIND HIM AS HE CAME
2194-141248-0025 ONLY HIS DARTS COULDN'T PENETRATE THE MAGTER'S THICK CLOTHING AS THE MAGTER TURNED ULV'S BREATH PULSED ONCE AND DEATH STUNG THE BACK OF THE OTHER MAN'S HAND HE COLLAPSED INTO A CRUMPLED HEAP DON'T SHOOT
2194-141248-0026 A VOICE CALLED FROM OUTSIDE THE CAVE AND A MAN STEPPED THROUGH THE SWIRLING DUST AND SMOKE TO STAND IN THE BEAM FROM THE LIGHT BRION CLUTCHED WILDLY AT ULV'S ARM DRAGGING THE BLOWGUN FROM THE DISAN'S MOUTH THE MAN IN THE LIGHT WORE A PROTECTIVE HELMET
2194-141248-0027 THICK BOOTS AND A POUCH HUNG UNIFORM HE WAS A NYJORDER THE REALIZATION WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCEPT
2194-141248-0028 YET THE NYJORD SOLDIER WAS HERE THE TWO FACTS COULDN'T BE ACCEPTED TOGETHER
2194-141248-0029 I KNOW WHAT THOSE DARTS CAN DO HE PULLED A MICROPHONE FROM ONE OF HIS POCKETS AND SPOKE INTO IT MORE SOLDIERS CROWDED INTO THE CAVE AND PROFESSOR COMMANDER KRAFFT CAME IN BEHIND THEM
2194-141248-0030 HE LOOKED STRANGELY OUT OF KEEPING IN THE DUSTY COMBAT UNIFORM THE GUN WAS EVEN MORE INCONGRUOUS IN HIS BLUE VEINED HAND AFTER GIVING THE PISTOL TO THE NEAREST SOLDIER WITH AN AIR OF RELIEF
2194-141248-0031 IT IS A PROFOUND AND SINCERE PLEASURE TO MEET YOU IN PERSON HE SAID
2194-141248-0032 HE WAS OBSESSED BY THE STRANGE FEELING THAT NONE OF THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE HAPPENING WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU AS THE MAN WHO SAVED US FROM OURSELVES KRAFFT SAID ONCE AGAIN THE PROFESSOR INSTEAD OF THE COMMANDER
2194-141248-0033 SIMPLY STATED BRION YOUR PLAN SUCCEEDED KRAFFT RELAYED YOUR MESSAGE TO ME AND AS SOON AS I HEARD IT I TURNED BACK AND MET HIM ON HIS SHIP
2194-141248-0034 BUT HE FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR I COULDN'T IGNORE HIS REPORT OF RADIOACTIVE TRACES YOUR GIRL FRIEND ARRIVED WITH THE HACKED UP CORPSE AT THE SAME TIME I DID AND WE ALL TOOK A LONG LOOK AT THE GREEN LEECH IN ITS SKULL
2194-141248-0035 HER EXPLANATION OF WHAT IT IS MADE SIGNIFICANT SENSE WE WERE ALREADY CARRYING OUT LANDINGS WHEN WE HAD YOUR CALL ABOUT SOMETHING HAVING BEEN STORED IN THE MAGTER TOWER AFTER THAT IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF FOLLOWING TRACKS AND THE TRANSMITTER YOU PLANTED
2194-141248-0036 BUT THE EXPLOSIONS AT MIDNIGHT BRION BROKE IN I HEARD THEM YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HYS LAUGHED NOT ONLY YOU BUT THE MAGTER IN THIS CAVE WE FIGURED THEY WOULD BE ARMED AND THE CAVE STRONGLY DEFENDED
2194-141248-0037 SO AT MIDNIGHT WE DROPPED A FEW LARGE CHEMICAL EXPLOSIVE BOMBS AT THE ENTRANCE ENOUGH TO KILL THE GUARDS WITHOUT BRINGING THE ROOF DOWN
2194-141248-0038 THE WARMTH OF THEIR INTENSE RELIEF AND HAPPINESS IT WAS A SENSATION HE WOULD NEVER FORGET
2194-141248-0039 KNOWING THAT THE DISAN HAD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF THE EXPLANATION
2194-141248-0040 YOU COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BRION SAID YOU LANDED ON THIS PLANET BEFORE YOU HAD MY MESSAGE ABOUT THE TOWER THAT MEANS YOU STILL EXPECTED THE MAGTER TO BE SENDING THEIR BOMBS TO NYJORD AND YOU MADE THE LANDINGS IN SPITE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE
2194-141248-0041 OF COURSE PROFESSOR KRAFFT SAID ASTONISHED AT BRION'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT ELSE COULD WE DO THE MAGTER ARE SICK HYS LAUGHED ALOUD AT BRION'S BAFFLED EXPRESSION YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND NYJORD PSYCHOLOGY HE SAID
2194-141248-0042 WHEN IT WAS A MATTER OF WAR AND KILLING MY PLANET COULD NEVER AGREE ON AN INTELLIGENT COURSE WAR IS SO ALIEN TO OUR PHILOSOPHY THAT IT COULDN'T EVEN BE CONSIDERED CORRECTLY THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH BEING A VEGETABLE EATER IN A GALAXY OF CARNIVORES
2194-141248-0043 YOU'RE EASY PREY FOR THE FIRST ONE THAT LANDS ON YOUR BACK ANY OTHER PLANET WOULD HAVE JUMPED ON THE MAGTER WITH BOTH FEET AND SHAKEN THE BOMBS OUT OF THEM WE FUMBLED IT SO LONG IT ALMOST GOT BOTH WORLDS KILLED YOUR MIND PARASITE DREW US BACK FROM THE BRINK
2194-141248-0044 I DON'T UNDERSTAND BRION SAID A SIMPLE MATTER OF DEFINITION BEFORE YOU CAME WE HAD NO WAY TO DEAL WITH THE MAGTER HERE ON DIS THEY REALLY WERE ALIEN TO US NOTHING THEY DID MADE SENSE
2194-141248-0045 AND NOTHING WE DID SEEMED TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT ON THEM BUT YOU DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE SICK AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE KNOW HOW TO HANDLE WE'RE UNITED AGAIN
2194-141248-0046 DOCTORS AND NURSES ARE ON THE WAY HERE NOW PLANS WERE PUT UNDER WAY TO EVACUATE WHAT PART OF THE POPULATION WE COULD UNTIL THE BOMBS WERE FOUND THE PLANET IS UNITED AGAIN AND WORKING HARD
2194-141248-0047 BECAUSE THE MAGTER ARE SICK INFECTED BY A DESTRUCTIVE LIFE FORM BRION ASKED EXACTLY SO PROFESSOR KRAFFT SAID WE ARE CIVILIZED AFTER ALL YOU CAN'T EXPECT US TO FIGHT A WAR
