7135-2346-0000 THE PURPLE OF THE BALKAN KINGS LUITPOLD WOLKENSTEIN FINANCIER AND DIPLOMAT ON A SMALL OBTRUSIVE SELF IMPORTANT SCALE
7135-2346-0001 SAT IN HIS FAVOURED CAFE IN THE WORLD WISE HABSBURG CAPITAL
7135-2346-0002 AND THE CUP OF CREAM TOPPED COFFEE AND ATTENDANT GLASS OF WATER
7135-2346-0003 A CUP OF CREAM TOPPED COFFEE ON HIS TABLE FOR YEARS HE HAD SAT AT THE SAME SPOT UNDER THE DUST COATED STUFFED EAGLE THAT HAD ONCE BEEN A LIVING SOARING BIRD ON THE STYRIAN MOUNTAINS
7135-2346-0004 AND WAS NOW MADE MONSTROUS AND SYMBOLICAL WITH A SECOND HEAD GRAFTED ON TO ITS NECK AND A GILT CROWN PLANTED ON EITHER DUSTY SKULL TO DAY
7135-2346-0005 LUITPOLD WOLKENSTEIN READ NO MORE THAN THE FIRST ARTICLE IN HIS PAPER BUT READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN THE TURKISH FORTRESS OF KIRK KILISSEH HAS FALLEN THE SERBS IT IS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED
7135-2346-0006 HAVE TAKEN KUMANOVO THE FORTRESS OF KIRK KILISSEH LOST KUMANOVO TAKEN BY THE SERBS THESE ARE TIDING FOR CONSTANTINOPLE RESEMBLING SOMETHING OUT OF SHAKSPEARE'S TRAGEDIES OF THE KINGS
7135-2346-0007 BUT ALSO WHAT POSITION AND WHAT INFLUENCE THE BALKAN STATES ARE TO HAVE IN THE WORLD FOR YEARS LONGER THAN A DOG'S LIFETIME LUITPOLD WOLKENSTEIN HAD DISPOSED OF THE PRETENSIONS AND STRIVINGS OF THE BALKAN STATES
7135-2346-0008 OVER THE CUP OF CREAM TOPPED COFFEE THAT SLEEK HEADED PICCOLOS HAD BROUGHT HIM NEVER TRAVELLING FURTHER EASTWARD THAN THE HORSE FAIR AT TEMESVAR NEVER INVITING PERSONAL RISK IN AN ENCOUNTER WITH ANYTHING MORE POTENTIALLY DESPERATE
7135-2346-0009 THAN A HARE OR PARTRIDGE HE HAD CONSTITUTED HIMSELF THE CRITICAL APPRAISER AND ARBITER
7135-2346-0010 AND HIS JUDGMENT HAD BEEN ONE OF UNSPARING CONTEMPT FOR SMALL SCALE EFFORTS OF UNQUESTIONING RESPECT FOR THE BIG BATTALIONS AND FULL PURSES
7135-2346-0011 OVER THE WHOLE SCENE OF THE BALKAN TERRITORIES AND THEIR TROUBLED HISTORIES HAD LOOMED THE COMMANDING MAGIC OF THE WORDS THE GREAT POWERS EVEN MORE IMPOSING IN THEIR TEUTONIC RENDERING
7135-2346-0012 WORSHIPPING POWER AND FORCE AND MONEY MASTERY AS AN ELDERLY NERVE RIDDEN WOMAN MIGHT WORSHIP YOUTHFUL PHYSICAL ENERGY THE COMFORTABLE PLUMP BODIED CAFE ORACLE
7135-2346-0013 HAD JESTED AND GIBED AT THE AMBITIONS OF THE BALKAN KINGLETS AND THEIR PEOPLES HAD UNLOOSED AGAINST THEM THAT BATTERY OF STRANGE LIP SOUNDS THAT A VIENNESE EMPLOYS ALMOST AS AN AUXILIARY LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS THE THOUGHTS
7135-2346-0014 WHEN HIS THOUGHTS ARE NOT COMPLIMENTARY BRITISH TRAVELLERS HAD VISITED THE BALKAN LANDS AND REPORTED HIGH THINGS OF THE BULGARIANS AND THEIR FUTURE RUSSIAN OFFICERS HAD TAKEN PEEPS AT THEIR ARMY AND CONFESSED
7135-2346-0015 THEY HAVE DONE IT BY THEMSELVES BUT OVER HIS CUPS OF COFFEE AND HIS HOUR LONG GAMES OF DOMINOES THE ORACLE HAD LAUGHED AND WAGGED HIS HEAD AND DISTILLED THE WORLDLY WISDOM OF HIS CASTLE
7135-2346-0016 HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN STIFLING THE ROLL OF THE WAR DRUM THAT WAS TRUE THE BIG BATTALIONS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WOULD HAVE TO DO SOME TALKING AND THEN THE BIG PURSES AND BIG THREATENINGS OF THE POWERS WOULD SPEAK
7135-2346-0017 AND THE LAST WORD WOULD BE WITH THEM IN IMAGINATION LUITPOLD HEARD THE ONWARD TRAMP OF THE RED FEZZED BAYONET BEARERS ECHOING THROUGH THE BALKAN PASSES
7135-2346-0018 SAW THE LITTLE SHEEPSKIN CLAD MANNIKINS DRIVEN BACK TO THEIR VILLAGES SAW THE AUGUSTLY CHIDING SPOKESMAN OF THE POWERS DICTATING ADJUSTING RESTORING SETTLING THINGS ONCE AGAIN IN THEIR ALLOTTED PLACES
7135-2346-0019 SWEEPING UP THE DUST OF CONFLICT AND NOW HIS EARS HAD TO LISTEN TO THE WAR DRUM ROLLING IN QUITE ANOTHER DIRECTION HAD TO LISTEN TO THE TRAMP OF BATTALIONS THAT WERE BIGGER AND BOLDER
7135-2346-0020 AND BETTER SKILLED IN WAR CRAFT THAN HE HAD DEEMED POSSIBLE IN THAT QUARTER HIS EYES HAD TO READ IN THE COLUMNS OF HIS ACCUSTOMED NEWSPAPER A WARNING TO THE GROSSMACHTE THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING NEW TO LEARN SOMETHING
7135-2346-0021 NEW TO RECKON WITH MUCH THAT WAS TIME HONOURED TO RELINQUISH THE GREAT POWERS WILL HAVE NOT LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THE BALKAN STATES OF THE INVIOLABILITY OF THE PRINCIPLE
7135-2346-0022 THAT EUROPE CANNOT PERMIT ANY FRESH PARTITION OF TERRITORY IN THE EAST WITHOUT HER APPROVAL EVEN NOW WHILE THE CAMPAIGN IS STILL UNDECIDED THERE ARE RUMOURS OF A PROJECT OF FISCAL UNITY
7135-2346-0023 EXTENDING OVER THE ENTIRE BALKAN LANDS AND FURTHER OF A CONSTITUTIONAL UNION IN IMITATION OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE THAT IS PERHAPS ONLY A POLITICAL STRAW BLOWN BY THE STORM
7135-2346-0024 BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DISMISS THE REFLECTION THAT THE BALKAN STATES LEAGUED TOGETHER COMMAND A MILITARY STRENGTH WITH WHICH THE GREAT POWERS WILL HAVE TO RECKON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE POURED OUT THEIR BLOOD ON THE BATTLEFIELDS
7135-2346-0025 AND SACRIFICED THE AVAILABLE ARMED MEN OF AN ENTIRE GENERATION IN ORDER TO ENCOMPASS A UNION WITH THEIR KINSFOLK WILL NOT REMAIN ANY LONGER IN AN ATTITUDE OF DEPENDENCE ON THE GREAT POWERS OR ON RUSSIA BUT WILL GO THEIR OWN WAYS
7135-2346-0026 THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN POURED FORTH TO DAY GIVES FOR THE FIRST TIME A GENUINE TONE TO THE PURPLE OF THE BALKAN KINGS THE GREAT POWERS CANNOT OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT A PEOPLE THAT HAS TASTED VICTORY
7135-2346-0027 WILL NOT LET ITSELF BE DRIVEN BACK AGAIN WITHIN ITS FORMER LIMITS TURKEY HAS LOST TO DAY NOT ONLY KIRK KILISSEH AND KUMANOVO BUT MACEDONIA ALSO LUITPOLD WOLKENSTEIN DRANK HIS COFFEE BUT
7135-2346-0028 THE FLAVOUR HAD SOMEHOW GONE OUT OF IT HIS WORLD HIS POMPOUS IMPOSING DICTATING WORLD HAD SUDDENLY ROLLED UP INTO NARROWER DIMENSIONS
7135-2346-0029 A FORCE THAT HE COULD NOT FATHOM COULD NOT COMPREHEND HAD MADE ITSELF RUDELY FELT
7135-2346-0030 AND THOSE ABOUT TO DIE HAD NOT SALUTED HAD NO INTENTION OF SALUTING A LESSON WAS BEING IMPOSED ON UNWILLING LEARNERS A LESSON OF RESPECT FOR CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
7135-2346-0031 AND IT WAS NOT THE SMALL STRUGGLING STATES WHO WERE BEING TAUGHT THE LESSON
