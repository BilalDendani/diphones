4243-187024-0000 CHRIS PUT DOWN HIS SPYGLASS AND THE TWO BOYS HIDDEN ON THE PINY KNOLL WATCHED THE PROCESSION OUT OF SIGHT I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM HER CHRIS SAID WITH HIS EYES SPARKLING BUT I KNOW NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO GIVE HER BACK IN RETURN
4243-187024-0001 I FEEL SORT OF SORRY FOR THAT GIRL HE ADDED THOUGHTFULLY
4243-187024-0002 AMOS WANTED TO KNOW WHAT ALL COMES NEXT
4243-187024-0003 CHRIS PASSED HIM SOME WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL DUSK ANYWAY HE SAID HIS VOICE ABSTRACTED AND BY THE LOOK OF THE LIGHT THAT WON'T BE LONG THE PINY KNOLL WAS STEEP AND ROCKY AND ONLY TWO ADVENTUROUS BOYS WOULD EVER HAVE REACHED THE TOP
4243-187024-0004 TOO PRECIPITOUS ON WHICH TO BUILD HOUSES IT ROSE FAR ABOVE THE SURROUNDING ROOFS OF PEKING THE GREEN AND SCARLET OF CURVED TILES SPREAD UNDER THE BOYS SIGHT LIKE A CURLING SEA
4243-187024-0005 BEFORE THEM STRETCHED OUT IN LONG ANGULAR WINGS TO RIGHT AND LEFT SWEPT THE PALACE WALLS LISTENING AND WATCHING THE BOYS GATHERED BY THE SILVER TRUMPET NOTES THAT THE PRINCESS AND HER RETINUE HAD RE ENTERED THE PALACE WALLS BY ANOTHER GATE
4243-187024-0006 BEFORE LEAVING FOR A NEW DOMAIN SHE WOULD PROBABLY TAKE THE JEWEL TREE WITH HER I CAN'T IMAGINE A WOMAN LEAVING A THING LIKE THAT BEHIND HE PAUSED REMEMBERING SHE HELD A SPRAY OF JEWELED FLOWERS IN HER HAND MAYBE OFF THE TREE
4243-187024-0007 LOOKED ACROSS WITH GREAT CONCERN TO WHERE AMOS LAY ON HIS BACK DOZING I CAN'T TAKE HIM ALONG CHRIS THOUGHT AND I CAN'T LEAVE HIM ALONE IF I SHOULD GET CAUGHT WHAT IN THE WORLD DO I DO THEN
4243-187024-0008 STRIKE THREE STRIKE THREE CHRIS HELD THE FOLDED OBJECT IN HIS HAND AND THEN GLANCED AT AMOS AMOS SLEPT GOING SOFTLY OUT OF THE PINE GROVE TO A NARROW LEDGE OF ROCK WHERE HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
4243-187024-0009 CHRIS PUT THE OBJECT DOWN AND SAID STRIKE THREE NOTHING HAPPENED THE OBJECT REMAINED AN OBJECT THEN SUDDENLY UNDERSTANDING CHRIS STRUCK THE STONE LEDGE THREE TIMES
4243-187024-0010 AT ONCE THE FOLDED OBJECT BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF AND TO PUFF ITSELF UP LIKE A LITTLE MUSHROOM IN A MATTER OF SECONDS CHRIS COULD SEE WHAT IT WAS BECOMING AND BEFORE HE COULD WINK TEN TIMES A BALLOON WITH A BASKET HANGING FROM IT
4243-187024-0011 QUITE BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO BOYS HUNG SWAYING IN THE AIR CHRIS EXAMINED IT WITH PLEASURE AND THEN STRUCK THE GROUND THREE TIMES AGAIN THE BALLOON GENTLY COLLAPSED AND REFOLDED ITSELF
4243-187024-0012 CHRIS EXCLAIMED THEN
4243-187024-0013 HE PICKED UP THE FOLDED BALLOON AND WENT TO WAKEN AMOS AMOS HE SAID SHAKING HIS FRIEND'S SHOULDER IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO ARE YOU AWAKE AMOS BLINKED A FEW TIMES AND SAID HE THOUGHT SO THEN LISTEN TO ME
4243-187024-0014 CHRIS TOLD HIM EARNESTLY AND LISTEN HARD AMOS SAT UP MORE ALERTLY I HAVE A HANDY THING HERE WHICH IS FOR YOU TO USE ONLY DO YOU HEAR ONLY IF I DON'T COME BACK
4243-187024-0015 AMOS'S EYES BEGAN TO GET BRIGHTER AND HE SWALLOWED DON'T COME BACK LAW CHRIS
4243-187024-0016 WHERE NOBODY UNDERSTANDS GOOD ENGLISH HE CRIED WHY UNLESS I'D STEAL AND MISS BECKY TOLD ME NEVER TO DO THAT BUT UNLESS I DID HOW COULD I EAT IN THESE FOREIGN PARTS CHRIS SAT BACK ON HIS HAUNCHES WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD MYSELF
4243-187024-0017 BUT DON'T YOU CROSS ANY BRIDGES UNTIL YOU COME TO THEM LOOK HE HELD OUT THE FOLDED BALLOON IF I'M NOT BACK BY TWO SUNUPS FROM NOW I MAY HAVE TO HIDE ALL DURING TOMORROW IF I'M NOT BACK BY THEN
4243-187024-0018 PUT THIS PACKAGE OUT BEYOND THE TREES IN THE CLEARING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT YOU'VE GOT THAT I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING BUT A FEW OLD DRIED UP FRUITS AMOS POUTED THAT'S ALL NO AMOS CHRIS GAVE HIM ANOTHER ROUSING SHAKE I MEAN

4243-187024-0020 THE LEDGE NEAR WHERE WE CLIMBED UP THAT'S BIG ENOUGH CHRIS REMINDED HIM OH YES AMOS SAID LOOKING WISE WELL CHRIS TOOK UP AGAIN YOU PUT THE PACKAGE ON THE LEDGE AND STRIKE THE GROUND THREE TIMES LIKE THIS
4243-187024-0021 PROMISE ME NOT TO STRIKE THREE AT ALL EXCEPT FOR EITHER OF THOSE TWO REASONS AMOS RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND LOOKING VERY SOLEMN I PROMISE HE SAID ONLY HE ADDED LOOKING BEWILDERED AND ALREADY SOMEWHAT FORLORN
4243-187024-0022 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I DO HIT THREE TIMES
4243-187024-0023 IT'S A SPECIAL KIND OF BALLOON CHRIS BEGAN AFTER CORRECTING WHAT HAD ALMOST BEEN A BAD SLIP A WHAT AMOS STUCK HIS HEAD FORWARD TRYING HARD TO UNDERSTAND A BALLOON OH CHRIS STOPPED AND STARED AT AMOS
4243-187024-0024 PERHAPS BALLOONS HAD NOT YET BEEN INVENTED HOW VERY CONFUSING IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL HOLD YOU UP IN THE AIR THERE'S A BASKET FOR YOU TO SIT IN NO SIR AMOS CRIED WAGGING HIS HEAD DECISIVELY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
4243-187024-0025 ME IN THE AIR OVER THE ROOFS AND HIGH UP NO INDEEDY CHRIS NOT ME CHRIS WAS BECOMING EXASPERATED HE HAD IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO LOOK AMOS IF YOU HAVE TO USE IT
4243-187024-0026 AND STAY HERE AND WAIT FOR ME DON'T FOLLOW ME NOW OR WATCH OR I MIGHT FAIL AMOS JUMPED UP FROM THE PINE COVERED GROUND OH CHRIS HE CRIED HIS VOICE SHARP WITH DISTRESS CAN'T I GO YOU MIGHT GET HURT
4243-187024-0027 THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU'RE ALL ALONE CHRIS WAS TEMPTED TO TAKE HIS FRIEND WITH HIM BUT SOMEONE MUST GET THE NEWS BACK TO THE MIRABELLE
4243-187024-0028 NO HE SAID AFTER A LONG MOMENT BETTER NOT BUT I'D SURE LIKE TO AMOS NOW DON'T LOSE THAT PACKAGE IT'S YOUR ESCAPE WISH ME LUCK AMOS CLASPED HIS HAND AND THEN RUSHING OFF DASHED BACK AGAIN HERE CHRIS
4243-187024-0029 OUR FRUITS BETTER NOT TO EAT STRANGE FOOD IN THIS FOREIGNY PLACE GOOD LUCK HE ADDED CHRIS STUFFED THE DRIED FRUIT IN HIS POCKET AMOS TURNED BACK INTO THE DARKENING PINE KNOLL AND CHRIS PUSHED HIS WAY OUT TO THE NARROW STEEP LEDGE
4243-187024-0030 HANGING HIGH ABOVE THE ROOFS OF PEKING CHRIS UNCOILED THE MAGIC ROPE FROM AROUND HIS WAIST AND STANDING AS FAR OUT ON THE ROCK LEDGE AS HE DARED IN ORDER TO HAVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT HE ATTEMPTED FOR THE FIRST TIME
4243-187024-0031 TO DRAW AN EAGLE IN THE AIR WITH THE ROPE IT WAS A COMPLICATED FAST MANEUVER THE ROPE TWISTED AND WHIPPED IN THE AIR AND THE RESULT WAS A MOLTED LOOKING DROOP TAILED BUZZARD ITS WINGS WERE NOT WIDE ENOUGH
4243-187024-0032 ITS BACK VERY INSECURE TO LOOK AT IN SHORT CHRIS KNEW IT WAS A TOTAL FAILURE HE TRIED AGAIN RACING AGAINST THE ONCOMING DARKNESS AND THIS TIME HE SUCCEEDED ALTHOUGH WHEN HE PULLED IT CLOSE AND STRADDLED THE BODY OF THE MAGIC BIRD
4243-187024-0033 HIS HEART WAS IN HIS THROAT THAT IT MIGHT UNFURL ITSELF BECOME JUST A ROPE AND HURL HIM TO HIS DEATH FAR BELOW BUT THIS SECOND EAGLE SEEMED SECURE ENOUGH CHRIS PRESSED HIS HANDS ON THE WINGS SPREAD OUT ON EITHER SIDE WITH A JOLT THEY FLAPPED
4243-187024-0034 AND THE BOY'S STRANGE CONVEYANCE MOVED SOMEWHAT UNSTEADILY THROUGH THE AIR CHRIS FRIGHTENED BUT RESOLUTE FOUND THAT BY TOUCHING THE HEAD OF THE BIRD IN THE DIRECTION HE WANTED TO GO THE MAGIC EAGLE WOULD TURN AND AFTER A FEW MOMENTS TO TEST OUT HIS NEW METHOD OF TRAVEL
4243-187024-0035 AS HE LOOKED FOR WHAT HE WANTED TO FIND AT LAST THE VERY FRAGRANCE RISING UP TOWARD HIM ON THE NIGHT AIR GUIDED HIM TO A LARGE PALACE SET IN GARDENS POOLS OF WATER REFLECTED THE FIRST STARS AMONG THEIR LILYPADS
4243-187024-0036 THE SHADED WALKS AND LAWNS WERE DESERTED AT THAT HOUR SWOOPING DOWN AND FLYING BACK AND FORTH TO MAKE SURE HE WOULD NOT BE SEEN CHRIS GROUNDED THE EAGLE AND HOLDING FAST TO ONE WING TIP IN CASE HE SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE OFF IN A HURRY
