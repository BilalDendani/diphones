4872-20425-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN AN EXPOSITION AND A TRAGEDY
4872-20425-0001 YOU MAY HAVE WONDERED THORNDYKE COMMENCED WHEN HE HAD POURED OUT THE COFFEE AND HANDED ROUND THE CUPS WHAT INDUCED ME TO UNDERTAKE THE MINUTE INVESTIGATION OF SO APPARENTLY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD A CASE PERHAPS I HAD BETTER EXPLAIN THAT FIRST
4872-20425-0002 AND LET YOU SEE WHAT WAS THE REAL STARTING POINT OF THE INQUIRY WHEN YOU MISTER MARCHMONT AND MISTER STEPHEN INTRODUCED THE CASE TO ME
4872-20425-0003 THERE WERE ONE OR TWO WHICH IMMEDIATELY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WAS THE WILL
4872-20425-0004 IT WAS PERFECTLY UNNECESSARY IT CONTAINED NO NEW MATTER IT EXPRESSED NO CHANGED INTENTIONS IT MET NO NEW CIRCUMSTANCES AS KNOWN TO THE TESTATOR IN SHORT IT WAS NOT REALLY A NEW WILL AT ALL
4872-20425-0005 BUT MERELY A REPETITION OF THE FIRST ONE DRAFTED IN DIFFERENT AND LESS SUITABLE LANGUAGE IT DIFFERED ONLY IN INTRODUCING A CERTAIN AMBIGUITY FROM WHICH THE ORIGINAL WAS FREE IT CREATED THE POSSIBILITY THAT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
4872-20425-0006 NOT KNOWN TO OR ANTICIPATED BY THE TESTATOR JOHN BLACKMORE MIGHT BECOME THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY CONTRARY TO THE OBVIOUS WISHES OF THE TESTATOR THE NEXT POINT THAT IMPRESSED ME WAS THE MANNER OF MISSUS WILSON'S DEATH
4872-20425-0007 SHE DIED OF CANCER NOW PEOPLE DO NOT DIE SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY OF CANCER THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE STANDS ALMOST ALONE
4872-20425-0008 MONTHS IN ADVANCE A PERSON WHO HAS AN INCURABLE CANCER IS A PERSON WHOSE DEATH MAY BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY AND ITS DATE FIXED WITHIN COMPARATIVELY NARROW LIMITS AND NOW OBSERVE
4872-20425-0009 THE REMARKABLE SERIES OF COINCIDENCES THAT ARE BROUGHT INTO LIGHT WHEN WE CONSIDER THIS PECULIARITY OF THE DISEASE
4872-20425-0010 MISTER JEFFREY'S SECOND WILL WAS SIGNED ON THE TWELFTH OF NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR AT A TIME THAT IS TO SAY WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF CANCER MUST HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MISSUS WILSON'S DOCTOR AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO ANY OF HER RELATIVES WHO CHOSE TO INQUIRE AFTER HER
4872-20425-0011 THEN YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THE REMARKABLE CHANGE IN MISTER JEFFREY'S HABITS COINCIDES IN THE MOST SINGULAR WAY WITH THE SAME EVENTS THE CANCER MUST HAVE BEEN DETECTABLE AS EARLY AS SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR ABOUT THE TIME IN FACT
4872-20425-0012 AT WHICH MISSUS WILSON MADE HER WILL MISTER JEFFREY WENT TO THE INN AT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER FROM THAT TIME HIS HABITS WERE TOTALLY CHANGED AND I CAN DEMONSTRATE TO YOU THAT A CHANGE
4872-20425-0013 CAME INTO EXISTENCE ABOUT THE TIME WHEN MISSUS WILSON WAS FIRST KNOWN TO BE SUFFERING FROM CANCER THIS STRUCK ME AS A VERY SUGGESTIVE FACT THEN THERE IS THE EXTRAORDINARILY OPPORTUNE DATE
4872-20425-0014 OF MISTER JEFFREY'S DEATH MISSUS WILSON DIED ON THE TWELFTH OF MARCH MISTER JEFFREY WAS FOUND DEAD ON THE FIFTEENTH OF MARCH HAVING APPARENTLY DIED ON THE FOURTEENTH ON WHICH DAY HE WAS SEEN ALIVE
4872-20425-0015 IF HE HAD DIED ONLY THREE DAYS SOONER HE WOULD HAVE PREDECEASED MISSUS WILSON AND HER PROPERTY WOULD NEVER HAVE DEVOLVED ON HIM AT ALL WHILE IF HE HAD LIVED ONLY A DAY OR TWO LONGER
4872-20425-0016 HE WOULD HAVE LEARNED OF HER DEATH AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MADE A NEW WILL OR CODICIL IN HIS NEPHEW'S FAVOUR CIRCUMSTANCES THEREFORE CONSPIRED IN THE MOST SINGULAR MANNER IN FAVOUR OF JOHN BLACKMORE
4872-20425-0017 BUT THERE IS YET ANOTHER COINCIDENCE JEFFREY'S BODY WAS FOUND BY THE MEREST CHANCE THE DAY AFTER HIS DEATH BUT IT MIGHT HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED FOR WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS AND IF IT HAD
4872-20425-0018 THEN MISSUS WILSON'S NEXT OF KIN WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE CONTESTED JOHN BLACKMORE'S CLAIM AND PROBABLY WITH SUCCESS ON THE GROUND THAT JEFFREY DIED BEFORE MISSUS WILSON BUT ALL THIS UNCERTAINTY
4872-20425-0019 IS PROVIDED FOR BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MISTER JEFFREY PAID HIS RENT PERSONALLY AND PREMATURELY TO THE PORTER ON THE FOURTEENTH OF MARCH THUS ESTABLISHING BEYOND QUESTION THE FACT THAT HE WAS ALIVE ON THAT DATE AND YET FURTHER
4872-20425-0020 IN CASE THE PORTER'S MEMORY SHOULD BE UNTRUSTWORTHY OR HIS STATEMENT DOUBTED JEFFREY FURNISHED A SIGNED AND DATED DOCUMENT THE CHEQUE WHICH COULD BE PRODUCED IN A COURT TO FURNISH INCONTESTABLE PROOF OF SURVIVAL TO SUM UP THIS PART OF THE EVIDENCE
4872-20425-0021 HERE WAS A WILL WHICH ENABLED JOHN BLACKMORE TO INHERIT THE FORTUNE OF A MAN WHO ALMOST CERTAINLY HAD NO INTENTION OF BEQUEATHING IT TO HIM THE WORDING OF THAT WILL SEEMED TO BE ADJUSTED TO THE PECULIARITIES OF MISSUS WILSON'S DISEASE
4872-20425-0022 AND THE DEATH OF THE TESTATOR OCCURRED UNDER A PECULIAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SEEMED TO BE EXACTLY ADJUSTED TO THE WORDING OF THE WILL OR TO PUT IT IN ANOTHER WAY THE WORDING OF THE WILL AND THE TIME THE MANNER AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TESTATOR'S DEATH
4872-20425-0023 ALL SEEMED TO BE PRECISELY ADJUSTED TO THE FACT THAT THE APPROXIMATE DATE OF MISSUS WILSON'S DEATH WAS KNOWN SOME MONTHS BEFORE IT OCCURRED NOW YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THIS COMPOUND GROUP OF COINCIDENCES ALL CONSPIRING TO A SINGLE END
4872-20425-0024 THE ENRICHMENT OF JOHN BLACKMORE HAS A VERY SINGULAR APPEARANCE COINCIDENCES ARE COMMON ENOUGH IN REAL LIFE BUT WE CANNOT ACCEPT TOO MANY AT A TIME
4872-20425-0025 THORNDYKE PAUSED AND MISTER MARCHMONT WHO HAD LISTENED WITH CLOSE ATTENTION NODDED AS HE GLANCED AT HIS SILENT PARTNER
4872-20425-0026 MY FIRST IDEA THORNDYKE RESUMED WAS THAT JOHN BLACKMORE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MENTAL ENFEEBLEMENT PRODUCED BY THE OPIUM HABIT HAD DICTATED THIS WILL TO JEFFREY IT WAS THEN THAT I SOUGHT PERMISSION TO INSPECT JEFFREY'S CHAMBERS
4872-20425-0027 TO LEARN WHAT I COULD ABOUT HIM AND TO SEE FOR MYSELF WHETHER THEY PRESENTED THE DIRTY AND DISORDERLY APPEARANCE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE REGULAR OPIUM SMOKER'S DEN BUT WHEN DURING A WALK INTO THE CITY I THOUGHT OVER THE CASE
4872-20425-0028 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THIS EXPLANATION HARDLY MET THE FACTS THEN I ENDEAVOURED TO THINK OF SOME OTHER EXPLANATION AND LOOKING OVER MY NOTES I OBSERVED TWO POINTS THAT SEEMED WORTH CONSIDERING
4872-20425-0029 WAS REALLY ACQUAINTED WITH JEFFREY BLACKMORE BOTH BEING STRANGERS WHO HAD ACCEPTED HIS IDENTITY ON HIS OWN STATEMENT
4872-20425-0030 WITH THE SINGLE EXCEPTION OF HIS BROTHER JOHN HAD EVER SEEN JEFFREY AT THE INN WHAT WAS THE IMPORT OF THESE TWO FACTS PROBABLY THEY HAD NONE BUT STILL THEY SUGGESTED THE DESIRABILITY OF CONSIDERING THE QUESTION
4872-20425-0031 WAS THE PERSON WHO SIGNED THE WILL REALLY JEFFREY BLACKMORE
4872-20425-0032 AND FORGED HIS SIGNATURE TO A FALSE WILL SEEMED WILDLY IMPROBABLE ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE BODY BUT IT INVOLVED NO ACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND IT OFFERED A COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF THE
4872-20425-0033 OTHERWISE INEXPLICABLE COINCIDENCES THAT I HAVE MENTIONED I DID NOT HOWEVER FOR A MOMENT THINK THAT THIS WAS THE TRUE EXPLANATION BUT I RESOLVED TO BEAR IT IN MIND TO TEST IT WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE
4872-20425-0034 AND CONSIDER IT BY THE LIGHT OF ANY FRESH FACTS THAT I MIGHT ACQUIRE THE NEW FACTS CAME SOONER THAN I HAD EXPECTED THAT SAME EVENING
4872-20425-0035 AND FOUND MISTER STEPHEN IN THE CHAMBERS BY HIM I WAS INFORMED THAT JEFFREY WAS A LEARNED ORIENTALIST WITH A QUITE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CUNEIFORM WRITING AND EVEN AS HE WAS TELLING ME THIS I LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER
4872-20425-0036 AND SAW A CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTION HANGING ON THE WALL UPSIDE DOWN NOW OF THIS THERE COULD BE ONLY ONE REASONABLE EXPLANATION DISREGARDING THE FACT THAT NO ONE WOULD SCREW THE SUSPENSION PLATES ON A FRAME WITHOUT ASCERTAINING WHICH WAS THE RIGHT WAY UP
4872-20425-0037 HE WAS NOT BLIND THOUGH HIS SIGHT WAS DEFECTIVE THE FRAME WAS THIRTY INCHES LONG AND THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS NEARLY AN INCH IN LENGTH ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE D EIGHTEEN LETTERS OF SNELLEN'S TEST TYPES
4872-20425-0038 AT A DISTANCE OF FIFTY FIVE FEET THERE WAS I REPEAT ONLY ONE REASONABLE EXPLANATION WHICH WAS THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD INHABITED THOSE CHAMBERS WAS NOT JEFFREY BLACKMORE THIS CONCLUSION
4872-20425-0039 RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FROM A FACT WHICH I OBSERVED LATER BUT MENTION IN THIS PLACE ON EXAMINING THE SOLES OF THE SHOES TAKEN FROM THE DEAD MAN'S FEET I FOUND ONLY THE ORDINARY MUD OF THE STREETS
4872-20425-0040 THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THE PECULIAR GRAVELLY MUD THAT ADHERED TO MY OWN BOOTS AND JERVIS'S AND WHICH CAME FROM THE SQUARE OF THE INN YET THE PORTER DISTINCTLY STATED THAT THE DECEASED AFTER PAYING THE RENT
4872-20425-0041 WALKED BACK TOWARDS HIS CHAMBERS ACROSS THE SQUARE THE MUD OF WHICH SHOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN CONSPICUOUS ON HIS SHOES THUS IN A MOMENT A WILDLY SPECULATIVE HYPOTHESIS HAD ASSUMED A HIGH DEGREE OF PROBABILITY
4872-20425-0042 WHEN MISTER STEPHEN WAS GONE JERVIS AND I LOOKED OVER THE CHAMBERS THOROUGHLY AND THEN ANOTHER CURIOUS FACT CAME TO LIGHT ON THE WALL
4872-20425-0043 ALL OF WHICH SHOWED RECENT DAMP SPOTS NOW APART FROM THE CONSIDERATION THAT JEFFREY WHO HAD BEEN AT THE TROUBLE AND EXPENSE OF COLLECTING THESE VALUABLE PRINTS WOULD HARDLY HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO ROT ON HIS WALLS THERE AROSE THE QUESTION HOW CAME THEY TO BE DAMP
4872-20425-0044 THERE WAS A GAS STOVE IN THE ROOM
4872-20425-0045 IT WAS WINTER WEATHER WHEN THE STOVE WOULD NATURALLY BE PRETTY CONSTANTLY ALIGHT HOW CAME THE WALLS TO BE SO DAMP THE ANSWER SEEMED TO BE THAT THE STOVE HAD NOT BEEN CONSTANTLY ALIGHT BUT HAD BEEN LIGHTED ONLY OCCASIONALLY
4872-20425-0046 THIS SUGGESTION WAS BORNE OUT BY A FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE ROOMS IN THE KITCHEN THERE WERE PRACTICALLY NO STORES AND HARDLY ANY ARRANGEMENTS EVEN FOR SIMPLE BACHELOR COOKING THE BEDROOM OFFERED THE SAME SUGGESTION
