7898-273040-0000 THERE WASN'T TIME THEN HOWEVER TO MAKE ANY TOILET BEFORE THE TRAIN LEFT THEY WERE OFF ON THE SHORT RUN TO SEVEN OAKS IN A VERY FEW MINUTES AFTER LEAVING THE LANAWAXA TOM WAS VERY MUCH EXCITED NOW
7898-273040-0001 HE CRANED HIS HEAD OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW TO CATCH THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE RED BRICK BARRACKS AND DOME OF THE GYMNASIUM WHICH WERE THE TWO MOST PROMINENT BUILDINGS BELONGING TO THE ACADEMY FINALLY THE HILL ON WHICH THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS STOOD FLASHED INTO VIEW
7898-273040-0002 THEY OCCUPIED THE SUMMIT OF THE KNOLL WHILE THE SEVEN GREAT OAKS STANDING IN A SORT OF DRUIDICAL CIRCLE DOTTED THE SMOOTH SLOPING LAWN THAT DESCENDED TO THE RAILROAD CUT OH HOW UGLY
7898-273040-0003 CRIED HELEN WHO HAD NEVER SEEN THE PLACE BEFORE I DO HOPE THAT BRIARWOOD HALL WILL BE PRETTIER THAN THAT
7898-273040-0004 THAT'S JUST LIKE A GIRL HE SAID WANTING A SCHOOL TO LOOK PRETTY PSHAW
7898-273040-0005 I HOPE I'LL GET IN WITH A GOOD CROWD I KNOW GIL WENTWORTH WHO CAME HERE LAST YEAR AND HE SAYS HE'LL PUT ME IN WITH A NICE BUNCH THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TRAIN WAS SLOWING DOWN THERE WAS A HANDSOME BRICK STATION AND A LONG PLATFORM
7898-273040-0006 THIS WAS CROWDED WITH BOYS ALL IN MILITARY GARB LIKE TOM'S OWN THEY LOOKED SO VERY TRIM AND HANDSOME THAT HELEN AND RUTH WERE QUITE EXCITED THERE WERE BOYS RANGING FROM LITTLE FELLOWS OF TEN IN KNICKERBOCKERS TO BIG CHAPS WHOSE MUSTACHES WERE SPROUTING ON THEIR UPPER LIPS
7898-273040-0007 THAT'S ALL RIGHT TOM SAID GRUFFLY
7898-273040-0008 THERE IT STANDS YONDER AND A JOLLY OLD SCARECROW OF A CARRIAGE IT IS TOO HE WAS EVIDENTLY FEELING SOMEWHAT FLURRIED HIMSELF HE WAS GOING TO MEET MORE THAN HALF THE GREAT SCHOOL INFORMALLY RIGHT THERE AT THE STATION
7898-273040-0009 BUT THE CAR IN WHICH OUR FRIENDS RODE STOPPED WELL ALONG THE PLATFORM AND VERY NEAR THE SPOT WHERE THE OLD BROWN BATTERED AND DUST COVERED STAGE COACH DRAWN BY TWO GREAT BONY HORSES STOOD IN THE FALL SUNSHINE
7898-273040-0010 MOST OF THE ACADEMY BOYS WERE AT THE OTHER END OF THE PLATFORM GIL WENTWORTH TOM'S FRIEND HAD GIVEN YOUNG CAMERON SEVERAL POINTERS AS TO HIS ATTITUDE ON ARRIVAL AT THE SEVEN OAKS STATION
7898-273040-0011 HE HAD PASSED THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS TWO MONTHS BEFORE SO AS TO BE LESS NOTICEABLE IN THE CROWD VERY SOON A SLOW AND DIRGE LIKE CHANT AROSE FROM THE CADETS GATHERED ON THE STATION PLATFORM FROM THE REAR CARS OF THE TRAIN HAD STEPPED SEVERAL BOYS IN CITIZEN'S GARB
7898-273040-0012 AND A DOUBTFUL AIR THAT PROCLAIMED THEM IMMEDIATELY
7898-273040-0013 FILED OFF INTO THE PATH LEADING UP TO THE ACADEMY WITH THEIR BAGS AND OTHER ENCUMBRANCES THE UNIFORMED BOYS EN MASSE GOT INTO STEP BEHIND THEM AND TRAMPED UP THE HILL SINGING THIS DREADFUL DIRGE
7898-273040-0014 THE UNFORTUNATE NEW ARRIVALS HAD TO LISTEN TO THE CHANT ALL THE WAY UP THE HILL IF THEY RAN TO GET AWAY FROM THE CROWD
7898-273040-0015 THE ONLY SENSIBLE WAY WAS TO ENDURE IT WITH A GRIN TOM GRINNED WIDELY HIMSELF FOR HE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN OVERLOOKED OR HE THOUGHT SO UNTIL HE HAD PLACED THE TWO GIRLS SAFELY IN THE BIG OMNIBUS HAD KISSED HELEN GOOD BYE AND SHAKEN HANDS WITH RUTH
7898-273040-0016 BUT THE GIRLS LOOKING OUT OF THE OPEN DOOR OF THE COACH SAW HIM DESCEND FROM THE STEP INTO THE MIDST OF A GROUP OF SOLEMN FACED BOYS WHO HAD ONLY HELD BACK OUT OF POLITENESS TO THE GIRLS WHOM TOM ESCORTED HELEN AND RUTH
7898-273040-0017 STIFLING THEIR AMUSEMENT HEARD AND SAW POOR TOM PUT THROUGH A MUCH MORE SEVERE EXAMINATION THAN THE OTHER BOYS
7898-273040-0018 HE WAS FORCED TO ENDURE A SEARCHING INQUIRY REGARDING HIS UPBRINGING AND PRIVATE AFFAIRS RIGHT WITHIN THE DELIGHTED HEARING OF THE WICKEDLY GIGGLING GIRLS AND THEN A TALL FELLOW STARTED TO PUT HIM THROUGH THE MANUAL OF ARMS
7898-273040-0019 POOR TOM WAS ALL AT SEA IN THAT AND THE YOUTH WITH GRAVITY DECLARED THAT HE WAS INSULTING THE UNIFORM BY HIS IGNORANCE AND CAUSED HIM TO REMOVE HIS COAT AND TURN IT INSIDE OUT
7898-273040-0020 IN A MOST RIDICULOUS RED FLANNEL GARMENT THE LINING OF THE COAT WHICH MADE HIM CONSPICUOUS FROM EVERY BARRACK WINDOW AND INDEED FROM EVERY PART OF THE ACADEMY HILL OH DEAR ME SIGHED HELEN
7898-273040-0021 HE WASN'T SO CUTE AS HE THOUGHT HE WAS BUT RUTH SUDDENLY BECAME SERIOUS
7898-273040-0022 OH THERE WAS BEING HELPED INTO THE COACH BY THE ROUGHLY DRESSED AND BEWHISKERED DRIVER THE LITTLE DOLL LIKE FOREIGN WOMAN WHOM THEY THOUGHT HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AT PORTAGETON
7898-273040-0023 AND STARTED TO SHUT THE DOOR THEN HE GLANCED FROM RUTH AND HELEN TO THE LITTLE FOREIGN LADY I LEAVE YE IN GOOD HANDS HE SAID WITH A HOARSE CHUCKLE
7898-273040-0024 IT SOUNDED LIKE PICKLE YET ON HIS TONGUE
7898-273040-0025 SAID THE LITTLE LADY RATHER TARTLY I MAY VENTURE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF IS IT NOT SHE DID NOT RAISE HER VEIL SHE SPOKE ENGLISH WITH SCARCELY ANY ACCENT
7898-273040-0026 OLD DOLLIVER THE STAGE DRIVER GRINNED BROADLY AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR
7898-273040-0027 YOU ARE GOING TO BRIARWOOD HALL THEN MY YOUNG LADIES SAID MISS PICOLET YES MA'AM SAID RUTH SHYLY I SHALL BE YOUR TEACHER IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
7898-273040-0028 HELEN AFTER ALL WAS MORE SHY THAN RUTH WITH STRANGERS WHEN SHE BECAME ACQUAINTED SHE GAINED CONFIDENCE RAPIDLY
7898-273040-0029 HELEN IS AS FAR ADVANCED AS I AM IN ALL STUDIES MISS PICOLET GOOD RETURNED THE TEACHER WE SHALL GET ON FAMOUSLY WITH SUCH BRIGHT GIRLS AND SHE NODDED SEVERAL TIMES
7898-273040-0030 BUT SHE WAS NOT REALLY COMPANIONABLE SHE NEVER RAISED HER VEIL AND SHE ONLY TALKED WITH THE GIRLS BY FITS AND STARTS THERE WERE LONG SPACES OF TIME WHEN SHE SAT HUDDLED IN THE CORNER OF HER SEAT WITH HER FACE TURNED FROM THEM AND NEVER SAID A WORD
7898-273040-0031 BUT THE NEARER THE RUMBLING OLD STAGECOACH APPROACHED THE PROMISED LAND OF BRIARWOOD HALL THE MORE EXCITED RUTH AND HELEN BECAME THEY GAZED OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE COACH DOORS AND THOUGHT THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY TRAVELED EVER SO PRETTY
7898-273040-0032 OCCASIONALLY OLD DOLLIVER WOULD LEAN OUT FROM HIS SEAT TWIST HIMSELF AROUND IN A MOST IMPOSSIBLE ATTITUDE
7898-273040-0033 SUDDENLY AS THEY SURMOUNTED A LONG RIDGE AND CAME OUT UPON THE MORE OPEN SUMMIT
7898-273040-0034 THROUGH AN OPEN GROVE AND ACROSS UNCULTIVATED FIELDS BEYOND A VAST BLUEBERRY PASTURE
7898-273040-0035 SHE SWUNG HER HAT BY ITS STRINGS IN HER HAND AND COMMENCED TO RUN UP THE HILL WHEN SHE SPIED THE COACH
7898-273040-0036 SHE SWUNG HER HAT EXCITEDLY AND ALTHOUGH THE GIRLS IN THE COACH COULD NOT HEAR HER THEY KNEW THAT SHE SHOUTED TO OLD DOLLIVER HE PULLED UP BRAKING THE LUMBERING WHEELS GRUMBLINGLY THE NEWCOMER'S SHARP FRECKLED FACE
7898-273040-0037 GREW PLAINER TO THE INTERESTED GAZE OF RUTH AND HELEN AS SHE CAME OUT OF THE SHADOW OF THE TREES INTO THE SUNLIGHT OF THE DUSTY HIGHWAY GOT ANY INFANTS DOLLIVER THE GIRL ASKED BREATHLESSLY TWO ON EM MISS COX REPLIED THE STAGE DRIVER
7898-273040-0038 THEN I'M IN TIME OF COURSE NOBODY'S MET EM HIST
