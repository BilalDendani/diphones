3448-5416-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN THE HUES OF LOVE CAPTAIN BRAMBLE DID NOT LONG REMAIN CONTENTED ON BOARD HIS SHIP THIS HE COULD NOT DO WHILE HE REALIZED THAT MISS HUNTINGTON WAS SO NEAR UPON THE SHORE
3448-5416-0001 HE DID LOVE THE LADY AND YET HIS SENTIMENT OF REGARD WAS SO MIXED UP WITH SELFISHNESS AND BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT AND PRIDE AT BEING REFUSED THAT THE SMALL GERM OF REAL AFFECTION WHICH HAD FOUND BIRTH IN HIS BOSOM WAS TOO MUCH CORRODED
3448-5416-0002 WITH ALLOY TO BE IDENTIFIED HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN OVERREACHED BY CAPTAIN RATLIN AND ALSO THAT HE HAD GOOD GROUNDS OF SUSPECTING HIS SUCCESSFUL RIVAL OF BEING EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ENGAGED IN THE ILLEGAL TRADE OF THE COAST
3448-5416-0003 AND DETERMINED IF POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER HIS SECRET HE AGAIN BECAME A FREQUENT VISITOR OF DON LEONARDO'S HOUSE WHERE HE WAS SURE TO MEET HIM CONSTANTLY THERE WERE TWO SPIRITS WHOM WE HAVE INTRODUCED TO THE READER IN THIS CONNECTION
3448-5416-0004 WHO WERE FITTING COMPANIONS FOR EACH OTHER BUT THEY HAD NOT AS YET BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER BY ANY CHANCE SO AS TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER WE REFER TO CAPTAIN BRAMBLE AND MAUD THE QUADROON BOTH NOW HATED CAPTAIN RATLIN
3448-5416-0005 AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE BEEN REVENGED IN ANY WAY FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF THEIR FEELINGS UPON HER WHOM HE SO FONDLY LOVED WITH THIS SIMILARITY OF SENTIMENT IT WAS NOT SINGULAR THAT THEY SHOULD ERE LONG DISCOVER THEMSELVES AND FEELINGS TO EACH OTHER
3448-5416-0006 INDEED MAUD WHO HAD BEEN A SECRET WITNESS OF THE DEED ALREADY REALIZED THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE WAS THE ENEMY OF HIM WHOM SHE HAD ONCE LOVED AND WHOM SHE NOW SO BITTERLY DESPISED
3448-5416-0007 UNTUTORED IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD AND FASHIONABLE INTRIGUE YET THE QUADROON SAW VERY CLEARLY THAT THROUGH CAPTAIN BRAMBLE SHE MIGHT CONSUMMATE THAT REVENGE WHICH SHE HAD SO SIGNALLY FAILED IN DOING BY THE AGENCY OF THE HOSTILE NEGRO TRIBES
3448-5416-0008 SHE HAD TREACHEROUSLY BROUGHT TO HER FATHER'S DOORS HE HAD NOT BEEN LONG AT THE FACTORY THEREFORE ON LANDING AFTER THE DUEL BEFORE MAUD SOUGHT A PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH HIM
3448-5416-0009 ON PRETEXT OF COMMUNICATING TO HIM SOME INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE OF VALUE TO HIM IN CONNECTION WITH HIS OFFICIAL DUTY TO THIS OF COURSE THE ENGLISH OFFICER RESPONDED AT ONCE SHREWDLY SUSPECTING AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE TRUTH
3448-5416-0010 HARD BY HER FATHER'S HOUSE YOU WILL SPEAK TRULY IN WHAT YOU TELL ME MY GOOD GIRL HE SAID SAGACIOUSLY AS HE LOOKED INTO HER DARK SPIRITED EYES WITH ADMIRATION HE COULD NOT AVOID HAVE I ANYTHING TO GAIN BY A LIE RESPONDED MAUD WITH A CURLING LIP
3448-5416-0011 NO I PRESUME NOT HE ANSWERED I MERELY ASK FROM ORDINARY PRECAUTION BUT WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO REVEAL TO ME SOMETHING TOUCHING THIS CAPTAIN RATLIN AY SAID THE GIRL QUICKLY IT IS OF HIM I WOULD SPEAK
3448-5416-0012 YOU ARE AN ENGLISH OFFICER AGENT OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AND SENT HERE TO SUPPRESS THIS VILE TRAFFIC TRUE AND HAVE YOU SUSPECTED NOTHING SINCE YOUR VESSEL HAS BEEN HERE I SUSPECT THAT THIS CAPTAIN RATLIN IS IN SOME WAY CONNECTED WITH THE TRADE
3448-5416-0013 HE IS AND BUT NOW AWAITS THE GATHERING OF A CARGO IN MY FATHER'S BARRACOONS TO SAIL WITH THEM TO THE WEST INDIES IT IS NOT HIS FIRST VOYAGE EITHER BUT WHERE IS HIS VESSEL
3448-5416-0014 THAT IS WHAT I WOULD REVEAL TO YOU I WILL DISCOVER TO YOU HIS SHIP IF YOU SWEAR TO ARREST HIM SEIZE THE VESSEL AND IF POSSIBLE HANG HIM YOU ARE BITTER INDEED SAID THE OFFICER
3448-5416-0015 ALMOST STARTLED AT THE FIENDISH EXPRESSION OF THE QUADROON'S COUNTENANCE AS SHE EMPHASIZED THOSE TWO EXPRESSIVE WORDS I HAVE REASON TO BE ANSWERED MAUD CALMING HER FEELINGS BY AN EFFORT HAS HE WRONGED YOU
3448-5416-0016 YES HE LOVES THE WHITE WOMAN WHOM HE BROUGHT TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE THUS FAR AT ALL EVENTS MY GOOD GIRL WE HAVE MUTUAL CAUSE FOR HATE AND WE WILL WORK HEARTILY TOGETHER YOU KNOW WHERE HIS VESSEL LIES I DO
3448-5416-0017 I WILL BE PREPARED WHERE SHALL WE MEET AT THE END OF THE CAPE WHERE YOU AND HE MET A FEW DAYS SINCE WHERE WE MET ASKED THE OTHER IN SURPRISE HOW KNEW YOU OF THAT I SAW IT
3448-5416-0018 THE DUEL YES IT IS STRANGE I THOUGHT NONE BUT OURSELVES WERE TO BE THERE HE HAS MOVED IN NO DIRECTION SINCE THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN HERE THAT I HAVE NOT FOLLOWED
3448-5416-0019 THERE I HOPED TO SEE HIM FALL BUT HE WAS STRANGELY PRESERVED YOU ARE A SINGULAR GIRL MAUD REPLIED THE OFFICER TAKE THIS AND WEAR IT FOR MY SAKE HE ADDED
3448-5416-0020 UNLOOSING A FINE GOLD CHAIN FROM HIS WATCH AND TOSSING IT AROUND HER NECK AND BE PUNCTUAL AT THAT SPOT TO NIGHT AFTER THE LAST RAY OF TWILIGHT I WILL ANSWERED THE QUADROON
3448-5416-0021 AS SHE REGARDED THE FINE WORKMANSHIP OF THE CHAIN FOR A MOMENT WITH IDLE AND CHILDLIKE PLEASURE THEN TURNING FROM THE SPOT THEY BOTH RETURNED THOUGH BY DIFFERENT PATHS FROM THE JUNGLE TOWARDS THE DWELLING OF HER FATHER
3448-5416-0022 CAPTAIN BRAMBLE DINED WITH DON LEONARDO THAT DAY AND HIS GOOD SPIRITS AND PLEASANT CONVERSE WERE AFTERWARDS THE SUBJECT OF COMMENT EXHIBITING HIM IN A FAIR MORE FAVORABLE LIGHT THAN HE HAD APPEARED IN SINCE HIS ARRIVAL AT THE FACTORY
3448-5416-0023 MAUD TOO EITHER FOR SAKE OF DISGUISE OR BECAUSE THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER PLAN IMPARTED EXHILARATION OF SPIRITS TO HER WAS MORE AGREEABLE SEEMINGLY FRANK AND FRIENDLY THAN SHE HAD BEEN FOR MANY A LONG DAY
3448-5416-0024 IF WE EXCEPT THE DAY BEFORE THE LATE ATTACK OF THE NEGROES UPON THE HOUSE WHEN THE SAME TREACHEROUS ASSUMPTION OF CHEERFULNESS AND SATISFACTION WITH ALL PARTIES WAS SIMILARLY ASSUMED CAPTAIN RATLIN ON HIS PART WAS EVER THE SAME
3448-5416-0025 HE FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT SOME WEEKS EVEN YET BEFORE HE COULD PROSECUTE THE PURPOSE OF HIS VOYAGE AND INDEED HE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ALL INTEREST IN IT
3448-5416-0026 HIS THOUGHTS WERE FULL OF TOO PURE AN OBJECT TO PERMIT HIM TO PARTICIPATE TO ANY EXTENT IN SO QUESTIONABLE A BUSINESS GLADLY WOULD HE AT ANY MOMENT HAVE THROWN UP HIS CHARGE OF THE SEA WITCH AND HE HAD INDEED PROMISED MISS HUNTINGTON
3448-5416-0027 FOR HE HAD NEVER ASPIRED TO ANY MORE INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP HE WOULD IGNORE THE TRADE ALTOGETHER AND THAT HE WOULD DESPATCH MISTER FAULKNER HIS FIRST OFFICER TO THE OWNERS IN CUBA WITH THE SHIP HE HAD HIMSELF TAKEN IN CHARGE
3448-5416-0028 HAVING BEEN BROUGHT UP FROM CHILDHOOD UPON THE SEA HE HAD NEVER STUDIED THE MORALITY OF THE TRADE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW ENGAGED BUT THE NICE SENSE OF HONOR WHICH WAS SO STRONG A CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS NATURE ONLY REQUIRED THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF A SWEET AND REFINED NATURE
3448-5416-0029 LIKE HER WITH WHOM PROVIDENCE HAD SO OPPORTUNELY THROWN HIM TO REFORM HIM ALTOGETHER OF THOSE ROUGHER IDEAS WHICH HE HAD NATURALLY IMBIBED IN THE COURSE OF HIS PERILOUS AND DARING PROFESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT FAIR AND PURE MINDED GIRL HE WAS AS A CHILD
3448-5416-0030 IMPRESSIBLE AND READY TO FOLLOW HER SIMPLEST INSTRUCTIONS ALL THIS BETOKENED A NATIVE REFINEMENT OF SOUL ELSE HE COULD NEVER HAVE EVINCED THE PLIABILITY WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM SO PLEASANT AND AGREEABLE A COMPANION TO HER HE SECRETLY LOVED
3448-5416-0031 LADY HE SAID TO HER AS THEY SAT TOGETHER THAT AFTERNOON HEAVEN HAS SENT YOU FOR A GUARDIAN ANGEL TO ME YOUR REFINING INFLUENCE HAS COME TO MY HEART AT ITS MOST LONELY ITS MOST NECESSARY MOMENT
3448-5416-0032 WHICH THOUGH IT AFFORDS FORTUNE AND COMMAND CAN NEVER PERMIT YOU SELF RESPECT THE SHIP WILL PROBABLY BE DESPATCHED WITHIN THESE TWO WEEKS AND THEN I WILL TAKE ANY BIRTH IN LEGITIMATE COMMERCE WHERE I MAY WIN AN HONORABLE NAME AND REPUTATION
3448-5416-0033 THERE IS MY HAND ON SO HONORABLE A RESOLUTION SAID MISS HUNTINGTON FRANKLY WHILE A SINGLE TEAR OF PLEASURE TREMBLED IN HER CLEAR LUSTROUS EYES THE YOUNG COMMANDER TOOK THE HAND RESPECTFULLY THAT WAITS EXTENDED TO HIM
3448-5416-0034 BUT WHEN HE RAISED HIS EYES TO HER FACE AND DETECTED THAT TEAR A THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT RAN THROUGH HIS BRAIN A FAINT SHADOW OF HOPE THAT PERHAPS SHE LOVED HIM OR MIGHT AT SOME FUTURE TIME DO SO
3448-5416-0035 AND BENDING OVER THE FAIR HAND HE HELD HE PRESSED IT GENTLY TO HIS LIPS HE WAS NOT REPULSED NOR CHIDED BUT SHE DELICATELY ROSE AND TURNED TO HER MOTHER'S APARTMENT HOW SMALL A THINGS WILL AFFECT THE WHOLE TENOR OF A LIFE TIME
3448-5416-0036 TRIFLES LIGHTER THAN STRAWS ARE LEVERS IN THE BUILDING UP OF DESTINY CAPTAIN RATLIN TURNED FROM THAT BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH A FEELING HE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED THE IDEA THAT MISS HUNTINGTON REALLY CARED FOR HIM
3448-5416-0037 BEYOND THE ORDINARY INTEREST THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCES HAD CAUSED HAD NOT THUS FAR BEEN ENTERTAINED BY HIM HAD THIS BEEN OTHERWISE HE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE DIFFERENTLY INTERPRETED MANY AGREEABLE TOKENS WHICH SHE HAD GRANTED HIM
3448-5416-0038 AND TO WHICH HIS MIND NOW WENT BACK EAGERLY TO RECALL AND CONSIDER UNDER THE NEW PHASE OF FEELING WHICH ACTUATED HIM HOW ELSE COULD HE INTERPRET THAT TEAR BUT AS SPRINGING FROM A HEART THAT WAS FULL OF KINDLY FEELING TOWARDS HIM
3448-5416-0039 IT WAS A TELL TALE DROP OF CRYSTAL THAT GLISTENED BUT ONE MOMENT THERE COULD IT HAVE BEEN FANCY WAS IT POSSIBLE HE COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THE MATTER ASSUMED AN ASPECT OF INTENSE IMPORTANCE IT HIS ESTIMATION
3448-5416-0040 HALF IN DOUBT HALF HOPING IN ONE INSTANT HOW DIFFERENT AN ASPECT ALL THINGS WORE LIFE ITS AIMS THE PERSONS HE MET AT THE DOOR AS HE NOW PASSED OUT
3448-5416-0041 EVEN THE FOLIAGE SEEMED TO PARTAKE OF THE FRESHNESS OF HIS SPIRIT AND THE WORLD TO BECOME REJUVENATED AND BEAUTIFIED IN EVERY ASPECT IN WHICH HE COULD VIEW IT THIS WAS THE BRIGHT TIDE OF THE PICTURE WHICH HIS IMAGINATION
3448-5416-0042 AIDED BY THAT GAUDY PAINTER AND FANCY COLORER HOPE HAD CONJURED UP BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE BUT THE REVERSE SIDE OF THE PICTURE WAS AT HAND AND NOW HE PAUSED TO ASK HIMSELF SERIOUSLY CAN THIS BE
3448-5416-0043 IS IT LIKELY THAT TWO SUCH PERSONS AS I HAVE CONSIDERED SHOULD BE JOINED BY INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP CAN SUCH BARRIERS AS THESE BE BROKEN DOWN BY LOVE ALAS I AM NOT SO BLIND SO FOOLISH SO UNREASONABLE
3448-5416-0044 AS TO BELIEVE IT FOR A MOMENT SO ONCE MORE THE HEART OF THE YOUNG COMMANDER WAS HEAVY WITHIN HIS BREAST IN THE MEAN TIME CAPTAIN BRAMBLE HAD FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY THAT AFTERNOON TO SEE MAUD
3448-5416-0045 FOR TO HAVE SEIZED THE VESSEL WITHOUT HER COMMANDER ON BOARD WOULD HAVE BEEN TO PERFORM BUT HALF THE BUSINESS HE HAD LAID OUT FOR THE NIGHT'S ENGAGEMENT BUT ALL SEEMED NOW PROPITIOUS AND HE AWAITED THE DARKNESS WITH IMPATIENCE
3448-5416-0046 WHEN HE MIGHT DISEMBARK A COUPLE OF BOAT LOADS OF SAILORS AND MARINES AND WITH THE QUADROON FOR GUIDE FOLLOW THE PATH THROUGH THE JUNGLE TO WHERE THE SEA WITCH LAY WHY DO YOU MUSE SO LONG AND LONELY MY CHILD
3448-5416-0047 AS SHE CAME IN AND SURPRISED HER GAZING OUT AT A WINDOW VACANTLY
3448-5416-0048 I WAS THINKING OVER OUR STRANGE FORTUNE SINCE WE LEFT CALCUTTA THE WRECK
3448-5416-0049 FORTUNATE MY DEAR I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW ABOUT THAT HERE WE HAVE BEEN CONFINED AT THIS SLAVE FACTORY LITTLE BETTER THAN THE SLAVES THEMSELVES THESE FOUR WEEKS WELL MOTHER
3448-5416-0050 CAPTAIN BRAMBLE SAYS HE SHALL SAIL SOON AND THEN WE CAN GO ROUND TO SIERRA LEONE AND FROM THENCE TAKE PASSAGE DIRECT FOR ENGLAND FOR MY PART I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY CAPTAIN BRAMBLE INSISTS UPON STAYING HERE SO LONG
3448-5416-0051 HE SAYS THAT BUSINESS AND DUTY WHICH HE CANNOT EXPLAIN DETAIN HIM HERE BUT THAT HE WILL SOON LEAVE OF WHICH HE WILL GIVE US DUE NOTICE HEAVEN HASTEN THE PERIOD SAID THE MOTHER IMPATIENTLY
3448-5416-0052 FOR I AM MOST HEARTILY TIRED AND WORN OUT WITH THE STRANGE LIFE WE LEAD HERE THIS CONVERSATION WILL EXPLAIN TO THE READER IN PART THE REASON WHY MISSUS HUNTINGTON AND HER DAUGHTER ENGLISH SUBJECTS AND IN DISTRESS UPON THE COAST
3448-5416-0053 HAD NOT AT ONCE GONE ON BOARD THE VESSEL OF THEIR SOVEREIGN WHICH LAY IN THE HARBOR AND BEEN CARRIED UPON THEIR DESTINATION FROM THE OUTSET CAPTAIN BRAMBLE HAD RESOLVED NOT TO LET HIS RIVAL SLIP THROUGH HIS FINGERS BY LEAVING PORT HIMSELF
3448-5416-0054 AND THUS HE HAD STILL REMAINED TO THE PRESENT TIME THOUGH WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE PLAN OF OPERATION FORMED UNTIL HE AVAILED HIMSELF OF MAUD'S PROPOSAL WHY BLESS ME MY CHILD
