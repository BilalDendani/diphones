3238-134398-0000 RELATING TO FAMILY MATTERS SHOWING HOW MISTER KENWIGS UNDERWENT VIOLENT AGITATION AND HOW MISSUS KENWIGS WAS AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
3238-134398-0001 AND IT WAS GROWING DARK IN THE NARROW STREETS NEAR GOLDEN SQUARE WHEN MISTER KENWIGS SENT OUT FOR A PAIR OF THE CHEAPEST WHITE KID GLOVES THOSE AT FOURTEEN PENCE AND SELECTING THE STRONGEST WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THE RIGHT HAND ONE
3238-134398-0002 WALKED DOWNSTAIRS WITH AN AIR OF POMP AND MUCH EXCITEMENT AND PROCEEDED TO MUFFLE THE KNOB OF THE STREET DOOR KNOCKER THEREIN HAVING EXECUTED THIS TASK WITH GREAT NICETY MISTER KENWIGS PULLED THE DOOR TO AFTER HIM
3238-134398-0003 AND JUST STEPPED ACROSS THE ROAD TO TRY THE EFFECT FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET SATISFIED THAT NOTHING COULD POSSIBLY LOOK BETTER IN ITS WAY MISTER KENWIGS THEN STEPPED BACK AGAIN AND CALLING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE TO MORLEENA TO OPEN THE DOOR
3238-134398-0004 VANISHED INTO THE HOUSE AND WAS SEEN NO LONGER NOW CONSIDERED AS AN ABSTRACT CIRCUMSTANCE THERE WAS NO MORE OBVIOUS CAUSE OR REASON WHY MISTER KENWIGS SHOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE OF MUFFLING THIS PARTICULAR KNOCKER
3238-134398-0005 BECAUSE FOR THE GREATER CONVENIENCE OF THE NUMEROUS LODGERS THE STREET DOOR ALWAYS STOOD WIDE OPEN AND THE KNOCKER WAS NEVER USED AT ALL THE FIRST FLOOR THE SECOND FLOOR AND THE THIRD FLOOR
3238-134398-0006 HAD EACH A BELL OF ITS OWN AS TO THE ATTICS NO ONE EVER CALLED ON THEM IF ANYBODY WANTED THE PARLOURS THEY WERE CLOSE AT HAND
3238-134398-0007 WHILE THE KITCHEN HAD A SEPARATE ENTRANCE DOWN THE AREA STEPS
3238-134398-0008 THIS MUFFLING OF THE KNOCKER WAS THOROUGHLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT KNOCKERS MAY BE MUFFLED FOR OTHER PURPOSES THAN THOSE OF MERE UTILITARIANISM AS IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE WAS CLEARLY SHOWN
3238-134398-0009 THERE ARE CERTAIN POLITE FORMS AND CEREMONIES WHICH MUST BE OBSERVED IN CIVILISED LIFE OR MANKIND RELAPSE INTO THEIR ORIGINAL BARBARISM NO GENTEEL LADY WAS EVER YET CONFINED INDEED
3238-134398-0010 NO GENTEEL CONFINEMENT CAN POSSIBLY TAKE PLACE WITHOUT THE ACCOMPANYING SYMBOL OF A MUFFLED KNOCKER MISSUS KENWIGS WAS A LADY OF SOME PRETENSIONS TO GENTILITY MISSUS KENWIGS WAS CONFINED AND THEREFORE
3238-134398-0011 MISTER KENWIGS TIED UP THE SILENT KNOCKER ON THE PREMISES IN A WHITE KID GLOVE I'M NOT QUITE CERTAIN NEITHER SAID MISTER KENWIGS ARRANGING HIS SHIRT COLLAR AND WALKING SLOWLY UPSTAIRS
3238-134398-0012 WHETHER AS IT'S A BOY I WON'T HAVE IT IN THE PAPERS PONDERING UPON THE ADVISABILITY OF THIS STEP
3238-134398-0013 MISTER KENWIGS BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE SITTING ROOM WHERE VARIOUS EXTREMELY DIMINUTIVE ARTICLES OF CLOTHING WERE AIRING ON A HORSE BEFORE THE FIRE
3238-134398-0014 THE DOCTOR WAS DANDLING THE BABY THAT IS THE OLD BABY NOT THE NEW ONE IT'S A FINE BOY MISTER KENWIGS SAID MISTER LUMBEY THE DOCTOR YOU CONSIDER HIM A FINE BOY DO YOU SIR RETURNED MISTER KENWIGS
3238-134398-0015 IT'S THE FINEST BOY I EVER SAW IN ALL MY LIFE SAID THE DOCTOR I NEVER SAW SUCH A BABY IT IS A PLEASANT THING TO REFLECT UPON AND FURNISHES A COMPLETE ANSWER TO THOSE WHO CONTEND FOR THE GRADUAL DEGENERATION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES
3238-134398-0016 THAT EVERY BABY BORN INTO THE WORLD IS A FINER ONE THAN THE LAST
3238-134398-0017 MORLEENA WAS A FINE BABY REMARKED MISTER KENWIGS AS IF THIS WERE RATHER AN ATTACK BY IMPLICATION UPON THE FAMILY THEY WERE ALL FINE BABIES SAID MISTER LUMBEY AND MISTER LUMBEY WENT ON NURSING THE BABY WITH A THOUGHTFUL LOOK
3238-134398-0018 WHETHER HE WAS CONSIDERING UNDER WHAT HEAD HE COULD BEST CHARGE THE NURSING IN THE BILL WAS BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF DURING THIS SHORT CONVERSATION MISS MORLEENA AS THE ELDEST OF THE FAMILY
3238-134398-0019 AND NATURAL REPRESENTATIVE OF HER MOTHER DURING HER INDISPOSITION HAD BEEN HUSTLING AND SLAPPING THE THREE YOUNGER MISS KENWIGSES WITHOUT INTERMISSION WHICH CONSIDERATE AND AFFECTIONATE CONDUCT
3238-134398-0020 BROUGHT TEARS INTO THE EYES OF MISTER KENWIGS AND CAUSED HIM TO DECLARE THAT
3238-134398-0021 THAT CHILD WAS A WOMAN SHE WILL BE A TREASURE TO THE MAN SHE MARRIES SIR SAID MISTER KENWIGS HALF ASIDE I THINK SHE'LL MARRY ABOVE HER STATION MISTER LUMBEY I SHOULDN'T WONDER AT ALL REPLIED THE DOCTOR
3238-134398-0022 THE DOCTOR SHOOK HIS HEAD AY SAID MISTER KENWIGS AS THOUGH HE PITIED HIM FROM HIS HEART THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF ALL THIS TIME THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT WHISKING IN AND OUT OF THE OTHER ROOM
3238-134398-0023 THE DOOR HAD BEEN OPENED AND SHUT VERY SOFTLY ABOUT TWENTY TIMES A MINUTE FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO KEEP MISSUS KENWIGS QUIET AND THE BABY HAD BEEN EXHIBITED TO A SCORE OR TWO OF DEPUTATIONS FROM A SELECT BODY OF FEMALE FRIENDS
3238-134398-0024 WHO HAD ASSEMBLED IN THE PASSAGE AND ABOUT THE STREET DOOR TO DISCUSS THE EVENT IN ALL ITS BEARINGS INDEED THE EXCITEMENT EXTENDED ITSELF OVER THE WHOLE STREET AND GROUPS OF LADIES MIGHT BE SEEN STANDING AT THE DOORS
3238-134398-0025 SOME IN THE INTERESTING CONDITION IN WHICH MISSUS KENWIGS HAD LAST APPEARED IN PUBLIC RELATING THEIR EXPERIENCES OF SIMILAR OCCURRENCES SOME FEW ACQUIRED GREAT CREDIT FROM HAVING PROPHESIED THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
3238-134398-0026 DIRECTLY THEY SAW MISTER KENWIGS TURN PALE AND RUN UP THE STREET AS HARD AS EVER HE COULD GO SOME SAID ONE THING AND SOME ANOTHER BUT ALL TALKED TOGETHER AND ALL AGREED UPON TWO POINTS FIRST
3238-134398-0027 IN THE MIDST OF THIS GENERAL HUBBUB DOCTOR LUMBEY SAT IN THE FIRST FLOOR FRONT AS BEFORE RELATED NURSING THE DEPOSED BABY AND TALKING TO MISTER KENWIGS HE WAS A STOUT BLUFF LOOKING GENTLEMAN
3238-134398-0028 WITH NO SHIRT COLLAR TO SPEAK OF AND A BEARD THAT HAD BEEN GROWING SINCE YESTERDAY MORNING FOR DOCTOR LUMBEY WAS POPULAR AND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS PROLIFIC AND THERE HAD BEEN NO LESS THAN THREE OTHER KNOCKERS MUFFLED ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS
3238-134398-0029 WELL MISTER KENWIGS SAID DOCTOR LUMBEY THIS MAKES SIX YOU'LL HAVE A FINE FAMILY IN TIME SIR I THINK SIX IS ALMOST ENOUGH SIR RETURNED MISTER KENWIGS POOH POOH SAID THE DOCTOR
3238-134398-0030 NONSENSE NOT HALF ENOUGH WITH THIS THE DOCTOR LAUGHED BUT HE DIDN'T LAUGH HALF AS MUCH AS A MARRIED FRIEND OF MISSUS KENWIGS'S
3238-134398-0031 AND WHO SEEMED TO CONSIDER IT ONE OF THE BEST JOKES EVER LAUNCHED UPON SOCIETY
3238-134398-0032 TAKING HIS SECOND DAUGHTER ON HIS KNEE THEY HAVE EXPECTATIONS OH INDEED SAID MISTER LUMBEY THE DOCTOR AND VERY GOOD ONES TOO I BELIEVE HAVEN'T THEY ASKED THE MARRIED LADY
3238-134398-0033 IT'S NOT EXACTLY FOR ME TO SAY WHAT THEY MAY BE OR WHAT THEY MAY NOT BE IT'S NOT FOR ME TO BOAST OF ANY FAMILY WITH WHICH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE CONNECTED AT THE SAME TIME MISSUS KENWIGS'S IS I SHOULD SAY
3238-134398-0034 SAID MISTER KENWIGS ABRUPTLY AND RAISING HIS VOICE AS HE SPOKE THAT MY CHILDREN MIGHT COME INTO A MATTER OF A HUNDRED POUND APIECE PERHAPS PERHAPS MORE BUT CERTAINLY THAT AND A VERY PRETTY LITTLE FORTUNE SAID THE MARRIED LADY
3238-134398-0035 THERE ARE SOME RELATIONS OF MISSUS KENWIGS'S SAID MISTER KENWIGS TAKING A PINCH OF SNUFF FROM THE DOCTOR'S BOX AND THEN SNEEZING VERY HARD FOR HE WASN'T USED TO IT THAT MIGHT LEAVE THEIR HUNDRED POUND APIECE TO TEN PEOPLE
3238-134398-0036 AND YET NOT GO BEGGING WHEN THEY HAD DONE IT AH I KNOW WHO YOU MEAN OBSERVED THE MARRIED LADY NODDING HER HEAD I MADE MENTION OF NO NAMES AND I WISH TO MAKE MENTION OF NO NAMES SAID MISTER KENWIGS WITH A PORTENTOUS LOOK
3238-134398-0037 MANY OF MY FRIENDS HAVE MET A RELATION OF MISSUS KENWIGS'S IN THIS VERY ROOM AS WOULD DO HONOUR TO ANY COMPANY THAT'S ALL I'VE MET HIM SAID THE MARRIED LADY WITH A GLANCE TOWARDS DOCTOR LUMBEY IT'S NATERALLY VERY GRATIFYING TO MY FEELINGS AS A FATHER
3238-134398-0038 TO SEE SUCH A MAN AS THAT A KISSING AND TAKING NOTICE OF MY CHILDREN PURSUED MISTER KENWIGS IT'S NATERALLY VERY GRATIFYING TO MY FEELINGS AS A MAN TO KNOW THAT MAN IT WILL BE NATERALLY VERY GRATIFYING TO MY FEELINGS AS A HUSBAND
3238-134398-0039 HAVING DELIVERED HIS SENTIMENTS IN THIS FORM OF WORDS MISTER KENWIGS ARRANGED HIS SECOND DAUGHTER'S FLAXEN TAIL AND BADE HER BE A GOOD GIRL AND MIND WHAT HER SISTER MORLEENA SAID
3238-134398-0040 THAT GIRL GROWS MORE LIKE HER MOTHER EVERY DAY SAID MISTER LUMBEY SUDDENLY STRICKEN WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION OF MORLEENA
3238-134398-0041 WHAT I ALWAYS SAY WHAT I ALWAYS DID SAY SHE'S THE VERY PICTER OF HER HAVING THUS DIRECTED THE GENERAL ATTENTION TO THE YOUNG LADY IN QUESTION THE MARRIED LADY EMBRACED THE OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING ANOTHER SIP OF THE BRANDY AND WATER

3238-134398-0046 QUITE RIDICULOUS CRIED THE DOCTOR SHE LOOKS A DEAL MORE LIKE HER OWN DAUGHTER SAID THE MARRIED LADY SO SHE DOES ASSENTED MISTER LUMBEY A GREAT DEAL MORE MISTER KENWIGS WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME FURTHER OBSERVATIONS
3238-134398-0047 MOST PROBABLY IN CONFIRMATION OF THIS OPINION WHEN ANOTHER MARRIED LADY WHO HAD LOOKED IN TO KEEP UP MISSUS KENWIGS'S SPIRITS AND HELP TO CLEAR OFF ANYTHING IN THE EATING AND DRINKING WAY THAT MIGHT BE GOING ABOUT PUT IN HER HEAD TO ANNOUNCE
3238-134398-0048 AND THAT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN AT THE DOOR WHO WANTED TO SEE MISTER KENWIGS MOST PARTICULAR SHADOWY VISIONS OF HIS DISTINGUISHED RELATION FLITTED THROUGH THE BRAIN OF MISTER KENWIGS AS THIS MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED
