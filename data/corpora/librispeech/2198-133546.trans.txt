2198-133546-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN OUTSIDE IN THE STREETS IT WAS FULL DAY AND THE COLOR AND LIFE OF CHARIN HAD SUBSIDED INTO LISTLESSNESS AGAIN A DIM MORNING DULLNESS AND SILENCE
2198-133546-0001 ONLY A FEW MEN LOUNGED WEARILY IN THE STREETS AS IF THE SUN HAD SAPPED THEIR ENERGY AND ALWAYS THE PALE FLEECY HAIRED CHILDREN HUMAN AND FURRED NONHUMAN PLAYED THEIR MYSTERIOUS GAMES ON THE CURBS AND GUTTERS
2198-133546-0002 AND STARING AT US WITH NEITHER CURIOSITY NOR MALICE MIELLYN WAS SHAKING WHEN SHE SET HER FEET INTO THE PATTERNED STONES OF THE STREET SHRINE SCARED MIELLYN I KNOW EVARIN YOU DON'T BUT HER MOUTH TWITCHED
2198-133546-0003 IN A PITIFUL ATTEMPT AT THE OLD MISCHIEF WHEN I AM WITH A GREAT AND VALOROUS EARTHMAN CUT IT OUT I GROWLED
2198-133546-0004 I STOOPED AND PUT MY ARMS ROUND HER LIKE THIS LIKE THIS SHE WHISPERED PRESSING HERSELF AGAINST ME A STAGGERING WHIRL OF DIZZY DARKNESS SWUNG ROUND MY HEAD THE STREET VANISHED AFTER AN INSTANT
2198-133546-0005 THE FLOOR STEADIED AND WE STEPPED INTO THE TERMINAL ROOM IN THE MASTERSHRINE UNDER A SKYLIGHT DIM WITH THE LAST RED SLANT OF SUNSET DISTANT HAMMERING NOISES RANG IN MY EARS MIELLYN WHISPERED EVARIN'S NOT HERE
2198-133546-0006 BUT HE MIGHT JUMP THROUGH AT ANY SECOND I WASN'T LISTENING WHERE IS THIS PLACE MIELLYN WHERE ON THE PLANET NO ONE KNOWS BUT EVARIN I THINK THERE ARE NO DOORS ANYONE WHO GOES IN OR OUT JUMPS THROUGH THE TRANSMITTER
2198-133546-0007 SHE POINTED THE SCANNING DEVICE IS IN THERE WE'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WORKROOM SHE WAS PATTING HER CRUSHED ROBES INTO PLACE SMOOTHING HER HAIR WITH FASTIDIOUS FINGERS I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A COMB I'VE NO TIME TO GO TO MY OWN
2198-133546-0008 I'D KNOWN SHE WAS A VAIN AND PAMPERED BRAT BUT THIS PASSED ALL REASON AND I SAID SO EXPLODING AT HER
2198-133546-0009 NEBRAN'S PRIESTESS WALK THROUGH THEIR WORKROOM ALL BLOWN ABOUT AND LOOKING LIKE THE TAG END OF AN ORGY IN ARDCARRAN ABASHED
2198-133546-0010 BUT USED IT TO GOOD PURPOSE SMOOTHING HER HAIR SWIFTLY REARRANGING HER LOOSE PINNED ROBE
2198-133546-0011 AN ARTLESS AND RATHER TEMPTING VIEW OF SOME DELICIOUS CURVATURE SHE REPLACED THE STARRED TIARA ON HER RINGLETS AND FINALLY OPENED THE DOOR OF THE WORKROOM
2198-133546-0012 AND WE WALKED THROUGH NOT FOR YEARS HAD I KNOWN THAT PARTICULAR SENSATION THOUSANDS OF EYES BORING HOLES IN THE CENTER OF MY BACK SOMEWHERE THERE WERE EYES THE ROUND INHUMAN ORBS OF THE DWARF CHAKS
2198-133546-0013 THE FACETED STARE OF THE PRISM EYES OF THE TOYS THE WORKROOM WASN'T A HUNDRED FEET LONG BUT IT FELT LONGER THAN A GOOD MANY MILES I'VE WALKED HERE AND THERE THE DWARFS MURMURED AN OBSEQUIOUS GREETING TO MIELLYN AND SHE MADE SOME LIGHTHEARTED ANSWER
2198-133546-0014 BUT I WAS DRENCHED WITH COLD SWEAT BEFORE THE FARTHER DOOR FINALLY CLOSED SAFE AND BLESSEDLY OPAQUE BEHIND US
2198-133546-0015 STEADY KID WHERE'S THE SCANNER SHE TOUCHED THE PANEL I'D SEEN
2198-133546-0016 EVARIN NEVER LET ME TOUCH IT THIS WAS A FINE TIME TO TELL ME THAT HOW DOES IT WORK IT'S AN ADAPTATION OF THE TRANSMITTER PRINCIPLE IT LETS YOU SEE ANYWHERE BUT WITHOUT JUMPING IT USES A TRACER MECHANISM LIKE THE ONE IN THE TOYS
2198-133546-0017 IF RAKHAL'S ELECTRICAL IMPULSE PATTERN WERE ON FILE JUST A MINUTE SHE FISHED OUT THE BIRD TOY AND UNWRAPPED IT HERE'S HOW WE FIND OUT WHICH OF YOU THIS IS KEYED TO I LOOKED AT THE FLEDGLING BIRD LYING INNOCENTLY IN HER PALM AS SHE PUSHED ASIDE THE FEATHERS EXPOSING A TINY CRYSTAL
2198-133546-0018 IF IT'S KEYED TO YOU YOU'LL SEE YOURSELF IN THIS AS IF THE SCREEN WERE A MIRROR IF IT'S KEYED TO RAKHAL SHE TOUCHED THE CRYSTAL TO THE SURFACE OF THE SCREEN LITTLE FLICKERS OF SNOW WAVERED AND DANCED THEN ABRUPTLY
2198-133546-0019 SLOWLY HE TURNED I SAW THE FAMILIAR SET OF HIS SHOULDERS SAW THE BACK OF HIS HEAD COME INTO AN AQUILINE PROFILE AND THE PROFILE TURN SLOWLY INTO A SCARRED SEARED MASK MORE HIDEOUSLY CLAW MARKED AND DISFIGURED THAN MY OWN
2198-133546-0020 RAKHAL I MUTTERED SHIFT THE FOCUS IF YOU CAN MIELLYN GET A LOOK OUT THE WINDOW OR SOMETHING CHARIN'S A BIG CITY
2198-133546-0021 RAKHAL WAS TALKING SOUNDLESSLY HIS LIPS MOVING AS HE SPOKE TO SOMEONE OUT OF SIGHT RANGE OF THE SCANNING DEVICE ABRUPTLY MIELLYN SAID THERE SHE HAD CAUGHT A WINDOW IN THE SIGHT FIELD OF THE PANE I COULD SEE A HIGH PYLON
2198-133546-0022 AND TWO OF THREE UPRIGHTS THAT LOOKED LIKE A BRIDGE JUST OUTSIDE I SAID IT'S THE BRIDGE OF SUMMER SNOWS I KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW TURN IT OFF MIELLYN WE CAN FIND HIM I WAS TURNING AWAY WHEN MIELLYN SCREAMED LOOK
2198-133546-0023 RAKHAL HAD TURNED HIS BACK ON THE SCANNER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I COULD SEE WHO HE WAS TALKING TO A HUNCHED CATLIKE SHOULDER TWISTED
2198-133546-0024 EVARIN I SWORE THAT DOES IT
2198-133546-0025 COME ON GIRL WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE THIS TIME THERE WAS NO PRETENSE OF NORMALITY AS WE DASHED THROUGH THE WORKROOM FINGERS DROPPED FROM HALF COMPLETED TOYS AS THEY STARED AFTER US TOYS I WANTED TO STOP AND SMASH THEM ALL
2198-133546-0026 BUT IF WE HURRIED WE MIGHT FIND RAKHAL AND WITH LUCK WE WOULD FIND EVARIN WITH HIM
2198-133546-0027 I'D REACHED A SATURATION POINT ON ADVENTURE I'D HAD ALL I WANTED I REALIZED THAT I'D BEEN UP ALL NIGHT THAT I WAS EXHAUSTED I WANTED TO MURDER AND SMASH AND WANTED TO FALL DOWN SOMEWHERE AND GO TO SLEEP ALL AT ONCE
2198-133546-0028 WE BANGED THE WORKROOM DOOR SHUT AND I TOOK TIME TO SHOVE A HEAVY DIVAN AGAINST IT BLOCKADING IT MIELLYN STARED THE LITTLE ONES WOULD NOT HARM ME SHE BEGAN I AM SACROSANCT I WASN'T SURE
2198-133546-0029 I HAD A NOTION HER STATUS HAD CHANGED PLENTY BEGINNING WHEN I SAW HER CHAINED AND DRUGGED AND STANDING UNDER THE HOVERING HORROR
2198-133546-0030 MAYBE BUT THERE'S NOTHING SACRED ABOUT ME SHE WAS ALREADY INSIDE THE RECESS WHERE THE TOAD GOD SQUATTED THERE IS A STREET SHRINE JUST BEYOND THE BRIDGE OF SUMMER SNOWS WE CAN JUMP DIRECTLY THERE ABRUPTLY SHE FROZE IN MY ARMS WITH A CONVULSIVE SHUDDER
2198-133546-0031 HE'S JUMPING IN QUICK SPACE REELED ROUND US AND THEN CAN YOU SPLIT INSTANTANEOUSNESS INTO FRAGMENTS IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE BUT SO HELP ME THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
2198-133546-0032 AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED OCCURRED WITHIN LESS THAN A SECOND WE LANDED IN THE STREET SHRINE
2198-133546-0033 THEN THERE WAS THE GIDDY INTERNAL WRENCHING
2198-133546-0034 MIELLYN CLUTCHED AT ME PRAY PRAY TO THE GODS OF TERRA IF THERE ARE ANY SHE CLUNG SO VIOLENTLY THAT IT FELT AS IF HER SMALL BODY WAS TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH ME AND COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE I HUNG ON TIGHT MIELLYN KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING IN THE TRANSMITTER
2198-133546-0035 WE JUMPED AGAIN THE SICKNESS OF DISORIENTATION FORCING A MOAN FROM THE GIRL AND DARKNESS SHIVERED ROUND US I LOOKED ON AN UNFAMILIAR STREET OF BLACK NIGHT AND DUST BLEARED STARS SHE WHIMPERED EVARIN KNOWS WHAT I'M DOING
2198-133546-0036 HE'S JUMPING US ALL OVER THE PLANET HE CAN WORK THE CONTROLS WITH HIS MIND PSYCHOKINETICS I CAN DO IT A LITTLE BUT I NEVER DARED OH HANG ON TIGHT THEN BEGAN ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING DUELS EVER FOUGHT MIELLYN WOULD MAKE SOME TINY MOVEMENT
2198-133546-0037 AND WE WOULD BE FALLING BLIND AND DIZZY THROUGH BLACKNESS HALFWAY THROUGH THE GIDDINESS A NEW DIRECTION WOULD WRENCH US AND WE WOULD BE THRUST ELSEWHERE AND LOOK OUT INTO A NEW STREET
2198-133546-0038 ONE INSTANT I SMELLED HOT COFFEE FROM THE SPACEPORT CAFE NEAR THE KHARSA AN INSTANT LATER IT WAS BLINDING NOON WITH CRIMSON FRONDS WAVING ABOVE US AND A DAZZLE OF WATER WE FLICKED IN AND OUT OF THE SALTY AIR OF SHAINSA
2198-133546-0039 MOONLIGHT NOON RED TWILIGHT FLICKERED AND WENT SHOT THROUGH WITH THE TERRIBLE GIDDINESS OF HYPERSPACE THEN SUDDENLY I CAUGHT A SECOND GLIMPSE OF THE BRIDGE AND THE PYLON A MOMENT'S OVERSIGHT HAD LANDED US FOR AN INSTANT IN CHARIN
2198-133546-0040 THE BLACKNESS STARTED TO REEL DOWN BUT MY REFLEXES ARE FAST AND I MADE ONE SWIFT SCRABBLING STEP FORWARD WE LURCHED SPRAWLED LOCKED TOGETHER ON THE STONES OF THE BRIDGE OF SUMMER SNOWS BATTERED AND BRUISED AND BLOODY WE WERE STILL ALIVE
2198-133546-0041 AND WHERE WE WANTED TO BE I LIFTED MIELLYN TO HER FEET HER EYES WERE DAZED WITH PAIN THE GROUND SWAYED AND ROCKED UNDER OUR FEET AS WE FLED ALONG THE BRIDGE
2198-133546-0042 JUDGING FROM ITS ANGLE WE COULDN'T BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED FEET FROM THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH I'D SEEN THAT LANDMARK IN THE SCANNER IN THIS STREET THERE WAS A WINESHOP
2198-133546-0043 I WALKED UP AND BANGED ON THE DOOR SILENCE I KNOCKED AGAIN AND HAD TIME TO WONDER IF WE'D FIND OURSELVES EXPLAINING THINGS TO SOME UNINVOLVED STRANGER THEN I HEARD A CHILD'S HIGH VOICE AND A DEEP FAMILIAR VOICE HUSHING IT
2198-133546-0044 THE DOOR OPENED JUST A CRACK TO REVEAL PART OF A SCARRED FACE IT DREW INTO A HIDEOUS GRIN
