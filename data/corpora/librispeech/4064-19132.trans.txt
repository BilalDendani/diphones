4064-19132-0000 A WEEKOR TWO HAD PASSED WHEN ONE DAY OLIVER CALLED HIS BROTHER ON THE PHONE HAVE YOU OR ALICE ANY ENGAGEMENT THIS EVENING HE ASKED I WANT TO BRING A FRIEND AROUND TO DINNER WHO IS IT INQUIRED MONTAGUE
4064-19132-0001 NOBODY YOU HAVE HEARD OF SAID OLIVER BUT I WANT YOU TO MEET HIM YOU WILL THINK HE'S RATHER QUEER BUT I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU AFTERWARDS TELL ALICE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR HIM MONTAGUE DELIVERED THE MESSAGE AND AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THEY WENT DOWNSTAIRS
4064-19132-0002 IN THE RECEPTION ROOM THEY MET OLIVER AND HIS FRIEND AND IT WAS ALL THAT MONTAGUE COULD DO TO REPRESS A LOOK OF CONSTERNATION THE NAME OF THE PERSONAGE WAS MISTER GAMBLE
4064-19132-0003 HE WAS A LITTLE MAN A TRIFLE OVER FIVE FEET HIGH AND SO FAT THAT ONE WONDERED HOW HE COULD GET ABOUT ALONE HIS CHIN AND NECK WERE A SERIES OF ROLLS OF FAT HIS FACE WAS ROUND LIKE A FULL MOON AND OUT OF IT
4064-19132-0004 LOOKED TWO LITTLE EYES LIKE THOSE OF A PIG IT WAS ONLY AFTER STUDYING THEM FOR A WHILE THAT ONE DISCOVERED THAT THEY TWINKLED SHREWDLY MISTER GAMBLE WAS ALTOGETHER THE VULGAREST LOOKING PERSONAGE THAT ALICE MONTAGUE HAD EVER MET
4064-19132-0005 HE PUT OUT A FAT LITTLE HAND TO HER AND SHE TOUCHED IT GINGERLY AND THEN GAZED AT OLIVER AND HIS BROTHER IN HELPLESS DISMAY GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING HE BEGAN VOLUBLY
4064-19132-0006 MISTER GAMBLE COMES FROM PITTSBURG INTERPOSED OLIVER INDEED SAID MONTAGUE STRIVING TO MAKE CONVERSATION ARE YOU IN BUSINESS THERE NO I AM OUT OF BUSINESS SAID MISTER GAMBLE WITH A SMILE
4064-19132-0007 MADE MY PILE SO TO SPEAK AND GOT OUT I WANT TO SEE THE WORLD A BIT BEFORE I GET TOO OLD THE WAITER CAME TO TAKE THEIR ORDERS IN THE MEANTIME MONTAGUE DARTED AN INDIGNANT GLANCE AT HIS BROTHER WHO SAT AND SMILED SERENELY
4064-19132-0008 THEN MONTAGUE CAUGHT ALICE'S EYE AND HE COULD ALMOST HEAR HER SAYING TO HIM WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT BUT IT PROVED NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK WITH THE GENTLEMAN FROM PITTSBURG HE APPEARED TO KNOW ALL THE GOSSIP OF THE METROPOLIS
4064-19132-0009 AND HE CHEERFULLY SUPPLIED THE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION HE HAD BEEN TO PALM BEACH AND HOT SPRINGS DURING THE WINTER AND TOLD ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN THERE HE WAS GOING TO NEWPORT IN THE SUMMER AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS THERE
4064-19132-0010 IF HE HAD THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF THE FACT THAT ALL HIS CONVERSATION WAS NOT SUPREMELY INTERESTING TO MONTAGUE AND HIS COUSIN HE GAVE NO HINT OF IT AFTER HE HAD DISPOSED OF THE ELABORATE DINNER WHICH OLIVER ORDERED
4064-19132-0011 MISTER GAMBLE PROPOSED THAT THEY VISIT ONE OF THE THEATRES HE HAD A BOX ALL READY IT SEEMED AND OLIVER ACCEPTED FOR ALICE BEFORE MONTAGUE COULD SAY A WORD FOR HER HE SPOKE FOR HIMSELF HOWEVER HE HAD IMPORTANT WORK TO DO AND MUST BE EXCUSED
4064-19132-0012 HE WENT UPSTAIRS AND SHOOK OFF HIS ANNOYANCE AND PLUNGED INTO HIS WORK SOMETIME AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HE WENT OUT FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR AND AS HE RETURNED HE FOUND OLIVER AND HIS FRIEND STANDING IN THE LOBBY OF THE HOTEL
4064-19132-0013 THE STEEL MAN YOU MEAN ASKED MONTAGUE NO I NEVER MET HIM WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIM SAID THE OTHER POOR CHAP IT REALLY WAS HARD LUCK YOU KNOW IT WASN'T HIS FAULT DID YOU EVER HEAR THE TRUE STORY NO SAID MONTAGUE
4064-19132-0014 IT BEGAN IN PARIS SOME NEWSPAPER WOMAN TRIED TO BLACKMAIL HIM AND HE HAD HER PUT IN JAIL FOR THREE MONTHS AND WHEN SHE GOT OUT AGAIN THEN THE PAPERS AT HOME BEGAN TO GET STORIES ABOUT POOR INGHAM'S CUTTING UP
4064-19132-0015 AND THE PUBLIC WENT WILD AND THEY MADE HIM RESIGN JUST IMAGINE IT GAMBLE CHUCKLED SO VIOLENTLY THAT HE WAS SEIZED BY A COUGHING SPELL AND HAD TO SIGNAL FOR A GLASS OF WATER
4064-19132-0016 THEY'VE GOT A NEW SCANDAL ON THEIR HANDS NOW SAID OLIVER THEY'RE A LIVELY CROWD THE STEEL FELLOWS LAUGHED THE OTHER THEY WANT TO MAKE DAVIDSON RESIGN TOO BUT HE'LL FIGHT THEM HE KNOWS TOO MUCH YOU SHOULD HEAR HIS STORY
4064-19132-0017 I IMAGINE IT'S NOT A VERY SAVOURY ONE SAID MONTAGUE FOR LACK OF SOMETHING TO SAY IT'S TOO BAD SAID THE OTHER EARNESTLY I HAVE TALKED TO THEM SOMETIMES BUT IT DON'T DO ANY GOOD I REMEMBER DAVIDSON ONE NIGHT
4064-19132-0018 JIM SAYS HE A FELLOW GETS A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY AND HE BUYS HIM EVERYTHING HE WANTS UNTIL AT LAST HE BUYS A WOMAN AND THEN HIS TROUBLE BEGINS IF YOU'RE BUYING PICTURES THERE'S AN END TO IT YOU GET YOUR WALLS COVERED SOONER OR LATER
4064-19132-0019 BUT YOU NEVER CAN SATISFY A WOMAN AND MISTER GAMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD TOO BAD TOO BAD HE REPEATED WERE YOU IN THE STEEL BUSINESS YOURSELF ASKED MONTAGUE POLITELY NO NO OIL WAS MY LINE
4064-19132-0020 I'VE BEEN FIGHTING THE TRUST AND LAST YEAR THEY BOUGHT ME OUT AND NOW I'M SEEING THE WORLD MISTER GAMBLE RELAPSED INTO THOUGHT AGAIN I NEVER WENT IN FOR THAT SORT OF THING MYSELF HE SAID MEDITATIVELY I AM A MARRIED MAN I AM

4064-19132-0022 THEY'RE STUNNING GIRLS I TELL YOU I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET THEM MISTER MONTAGUE I SHOULD BE PLEASED SAID MONTAGUE WRITHING INWARDLY
4064-19132-0023 MONTAGUE SAW HIM CLAMBER LABORIOUSLY INTO HIS AUTOMOBILE AND THEN HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER
4064-19132-0024 WHAT MEAN ASKED OLIVER INNOCENTLY THAT MAN EXCLAIMED THE OTHER WHY I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET HIM SAID OLIVER HE IS AN INTERESTING CHAP I AM IN NO MOOD FOR FOOLING SAID HIS BROTHER ANGRILY

4064-19132-0028 BUT HIS WIFE AND HIS DAUGHTERS EXCLAIMED THE OTHER OH THAT'S NOT IT THE FAMILY STAYS IN PITTSBURG IT'S ONLY HIMSELF THIS TIME ALL THE SAME OLIVER ADDED AFTER A PAUSE
4064-19132-0029 MY GOD BUT I'M TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE OTHER PROTESTED THAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL STAND FOR A MAN LIKE THAT SOME OF THEM WILL
4064-19132-0030 HE'S GOT BARRELS OF MONEY YOU KNOW AND HE UNDERSTANDS THE SITUATION PERFECTLY HE WON'T MAKE MANY MISTAKES
4064-19132-0031 THAT'S ALL VERY WELL SAID THE OTHER BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO INFLICT SUCH A MAN UPON ALICE OH STUFF SAID OLIVER SHE'LL MEET HIM AT NEWPORT THIS SUMMER ANYWAY
4064-19132-0032 HOW COULD I INTRODUCE HIM ANYWHERE ELSE IF I WASN'T WILLING TO INTRODUCE HIM HERE HE WON'T HURT ALICE HE GAVE HER A GOOD TIME THIS EVENING AND I WAGER SHE'LL LIKE HIM BEFORE HE GETS THROUGH HE'S REALLY A GOOD NATURED CHAP
4064-19132-0033 THE CHIEF TROUBLE WITH HIM IS THAT HE GETS CONFIDENTIAL MONTAGUE RELAPSED INTO SILENCE AND OLIVER CHANGED THE SUBJECT IT SEEMS TOO BAD ABOUT LUCY HE SAID IS THERE NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT
4064-19132-0034 NOTHING SAID THE OTHER SHE IS SIMPLY RUINING HERSELF SAID OLIVER I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET REGGIE MANN TO HAVE HER INTRODUCED TO MISSUS DEVON BUT HE SAYS HE WOULDN'T DARE TO TAKE THE RISK NO I PRESUME NOT SAID MONTAGUE
4064-19132-0035 IT'S A SHAME SAID OLIVER I THOUGHT MISSUS BILLY ALDEN WOULD ASK HER TO NEWPORT THIS SUMMER BUT NOW I DON'T BELIEVE SHE'LL HAVE A THING TO DO WITH HER LUCY WILL FIND SHE KNOWS NOBODY EXCEPT STANLEY RYDER AND HIS CROWD
4064-19132-0036 THEY SAY HE'S MAKING BARRELS OF MONEY SAID OLIVER THEN HE ADDED LONGINGLY MY GOD I WISH I HAD A TRUST COMPANY TO PLAY WITH WHY A TRUST COMPANY PARTICULARLY ASKED THE OTHER IT'S THE EASIEST GRAFT THAT'S GOING SAID OLIVER
4064-19132-0037 YOU'VE NOTICED THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS I SUPPOSE I HAVE NOTICED THEM SAID MONTAGUE HE IS ADDING SOMETHING OVER A MILLION A MONTH I HEAR IT SOUNDS VERY ATTRACTIVE SAID THE OTHER AND ADDED DRILY
4064-19132-0038 I SUPPOSE RYDER FEELS AS IF HE OWNED IT ALL HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL OWN IT WAS THE REPLY IF I WERE GOING INTO WALL STREET TO MAKE MONEY I'D RATHER HAVE THE CONTROL OF FIFTY MILLIONS THAN THE ABSOLUTE OWNERSHIP OF TEN
4064-19132-0039 BY THE WAY OLIVER REMARKED AFTER A MOMENT THE PRENTICES HAVE ASKED ALICE UP TO NEWPORT ALICE SEEMS TO BE QUITE TAKEN WITH THAT YOUNG CHAP CURTISS HE COMES AROUND A GOOD DEAL SAID MONTAGUE HE SEEMS A VERY DECENT FELLOW
4064-19132-0040 NO DOUBT SAID THE OTHER BUT HE HASN'T ENOUGH MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF A GIRL LIKE ALICE
