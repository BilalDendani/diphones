8272-279781-0011 AND PUT IT ROUND THE ROE'S NECK THEN PULLED SOME RUSHES AND WOVE THEM INTO A CORD TO THIS SHE TIED THE LITTLE ANIMAL AND LED HIM ON AND THEY BOTH WENT STILL DEEPER INTO THE WOOD WHEN THEY HAD GONE A LONG LONG WAY
8272-279781-0012 THEY CAME AT LAST TO A LITTLE HOUSE INTO WHICH THE MAIDEN PEEPED AND AS IT WAS EMPTY SHE THOUGHT HERE WE MAY STAY AND LIVE SO SHE MADE A PRETTY BED OF LEAVES AND MOSS FOR THE ROE AND EVERY MORNING SHE WENT OUT AND GATHERED ROOTS BERRIES AND NUTS FOR HERSELF
8272-279781-0013 AND FOR THE ROE SHE BROUGHT TENDER GRASS WHICH HE ATE OUT OF HER HAND AND PLAYED ABOUT AND WAS VERY HAPPY IN THE EVENING WHEN THE LITTLE SISTER WAS TIRED AND HAD SAID HER PRAYERS SHE LAID HER HEAD UPON THE ROE WHO WAS HER PILLOW AND WENT SWEETLY TO SLEEP
8272-279781-0014 AND IF HER BROTHER HAD ONLY KEPT HIS PROPER SHAPE THEY WOULD HAVE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE THEY HAD LIVED ALONE IN THIS WAY DURING A LONG TIME WHEN IT HAPPENED THAT THE KING OF THE COUNTRY HELD A GREAT HUNT IN THE FOREST

8272-279781-0032 AND PLAYED ALL DAY ABOUT THE PALACE GARDEN BUT THE WICKED STEPMOTHER ON WHOSE ACCOUNT THESE CHILDREN HAD BEEN DRIVEN INTO THE WIDE WORLD THOUGHT NOTHING LESS THAN THAT THE LITTLE SISTER HAD BEEN TORN TO PIECES BY WILD BEASTS IN THE FOREST
8272-279781-0033 AND THAT THE BROTHER IN THE SHAPE OF A ROE HAD BEEN KILLED BY THE HUNTERS WHEN SHE NOW HEARD THEY WERE SO HAPPY AND THAT EVERYTHING WENT WELL WITH THEM ENVY AND SPITE RAGED IN HER HEART AND GAVE HER NO REST

8272-279781-0039 SHE CHANGED HER ALSO INTO THE SHAPE OF THE YOUNG QUEEN ALL EXCEPT HER ONE EYE AND SHE COULD NOT GIVE HER ANOTHER BUT IN ORDER THAT THE KING MIGHT NOT OBSERVE IT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE ON THAT SIDE WHERE THERE WAS NO EYE
8272-279781-0040 IN THE EVENING WHEN HE WAS COME HOME AND HEARD THAT HE HAD A LITTLE SON HE WAS VERY MUCH DELIGHTED AND WISHED TO VISIT HIS DEAR WIFE AND SEE HOW SHE WAS GETTING ON ON WHICH THE OLD WOMAN CRIED OUT IN A GREAT HURRY AS YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE DON'T TOUCH THE CURTAIN
8272-279781-0041 THE QUEEN MUST NOT SEE THE LIGHT AND MUST BE LEFT QUITE QUIET SO THE KING WENT AWAY AND NEVER FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS A FALSE QUEEN IN THE BED BUT WHEN IT WAS MIDNIGHT AND ALL THE WORLD WAS ASLEEP THE NURSE WHO WAS SITTING BESIDE THE CRADLE
