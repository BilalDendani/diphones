4931-28257-0000 THE SPANIARDS WERE NATURALLY TOO INDOLENT TO BE AFFECTED IN ANY WAY BY AN INCIDENT THAT CONCERNED THEMSELVES SO REMOTELY WHILE THE RUSSIANS FELT THEMSELVES SIMPLY RELIANT ON THEIR MASTER AND AS LONG AS THEY WERE WITH HIM
4931-28257-0001 WERE CARELESS AS TO WHERE OR HOW THEY SPENT THEIR DAYS EVERYTHING WENT ON WITH THEM IN AN ACCUSTOMED ROUTINE AND THEY LAY DOWN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND AWOKE TO THEIR AVOCATIONS MORNING AFTER MORNING
4931-28257-0002 ALL NIGHT LONG BEN ZOOF WOULD NOT LEAVE THE PROFESSOR'S BEDSIDE HE HAD CONSTITUTED HIMSELF SICK NURSE AND CONSIDERED HIS REPUTATION AT STAKE IF HE FAILED TO SET HIS PATIENT ON HIS FEET AGAIN HE WATCHED EVERY MOVEMENT
4931-28257-0003 LISTENED TO EVERY BREATH AND NEVER FAILED TO ADMINISTER THE STRONGEST CORDIALS UPON THE SLIGHTEST PRETEXT
4931-28257-0004 EVER AND AGAIN SOMETIMES IN A TONE OF UNEASINESS AND SOMETIMES WITH THE EXPRESSION OF POSITIVE ANGER THE NAME OF GALLIA ESCAPED HIS LIPS AS THOUGH HE WERE DREAMING THAT HIS CLAIM TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE COMET WAS BEING CONTESTED OR DENIED
4931-28257-0005 BUT ALTHOUGH HIS ATTENDANT WAS ON THE ALERT TO GATHER ALL HE COULD HE WAS ABLE TO CATCH NOTHING IN THE INCOHERENT SENTENCES THAT SERVED TO THROW ANY REAL LIGHT UPON THE PROBLEM THAT THEY WERE ALL EAGER TO SOLVE
4931-28257-0006 AND BEN ZOOF WHO WAS ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS THAT THE REPOSE WHICH PROMISED TO BE SO BENEFICIAL SHOULD NOT BE DISTURBED FELT CONSIDERABLE ANNOYANCE AT HEARING A LOUD KNOCKING EVIDENTLY OF SOME BLUNT HEAVY INSTRUMENT AGAINST A DOOR THAT HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GALLERY
4931-28257-0007 MORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RETAINING INTERNAL WARMTH THAN FOR GUARDING AGAINST INTRUSION FROM WITHOUT CONFOUND IT SAID BEN ZOOF I MUST PUT A STOP TO THIS AND HE MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE DOOR WHO'S THERE HE CRIED
4931-28257-0008 IN NO VERY AMIABLE TONE I REPLIED THE QUAVERING VOICE WHO ARE YOU ISAAC HAKKABUT LET ME IN DO PLEASE LET ME IN OH

4931-28257-0012 WHEN SERVADAC WHO HAD BEEN ROUSED BY THE SOUND OF VOICES CALLED OUT WHAT'S THE MATTER BEN ZOOF OH NOTHING SIR ONLY THAT HOUND OF A HAKKABUT SAYS HE WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU LET HIM IN THEN
4931-28257-0013 BEN ZOOF HESITATED LET HIM IN I SAY REPEATED THE CAPTAIN PEREMPTORILY HOWEVER RELUCTANTLY BEN ZOOF OBEYED
4931-28257-0014 AND ISAAC HAKKABUT ENVELOPED IN AN OLD OVERCOAT SHUFFLED INTO THE GALLERY IN A FEW MOMENTS SERVADAC APPROACHED
4931-28257-0015 WITHOUT VOUCHSAFING ANY REPLY THE CAPTAIN BECKONED TO THE OLD MAN TO FOLLOW HIM AND LEADING THE WAY TO THE CENTRAL HALL STOPPED AND TURNING SO AS TO LOOK HIM STEADILY IN THE FACE SAID NOW IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT
4931-28257-0016 OH MY LORD MY LORD WHINED ISAAC YOU MUST HAVE SOME NEWS TO TELL ME NEWS WHAT DO YOU MEAN FROM MY LITTLE TARTAN YONDER I SAW THE YAWL GO OUT FROM THE ROCK HERE ON A JOURNEY
4931-28257-0017 AND I SAW IT COME BACK AND IT BROUGHT A STRANGER AND I THOUGHT I THOUGHT I THOUGHT WELL YOU THOUGHT WHAT DID YOU THINK WHY THAT PERHAPS THE STRANGER HAD COME FROM THE NORTHERN SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THAT I MIGHT ASK HIM
4931-28257-0018 HE PAUSED AGAIN AND GAVE A GLANCE AT THE CAPTAIN
4931-28257-0019 HAKKABUT BLURTED OUT AT LAST SERVADAC SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN CONTEMPT AND TURNED AWAY
4931-28257-0020 AND YET REFUSING TO BELIEVE THAT HIS HOPE OF MAKING GOOD BARGAINS WITH EUROPEAN TRADERS WAS AT AN END SURELY NOTHING THOUGHT THE CAPTAIN WILL CONVINCE THE OLD RASCAL NOW AND HE MOVED OFF IN DISGUST
4931-28257-0021 THE ORDERLY HOWEVER WHO HAD LISTENED WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT WAS BY NO MEANS DISINCLINED FOR THE CONVERSATION TO BE CONTINUED ARE YOU SATISFIED OLD EZEKIEL HE ASKED ISN'T IT SO AM I NOT RIGHT

4931-28257-0024 THE JEW SIDLED CLOSE UP TO BEN ZOOF AND LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS ARM SAID IN A LOW AND INSINUATING TONE I AM POOR YOU KNOW BUT I WOULD GIVE YOU A FEW REALS IF YOU WOULD LET ME TALK TO THIS STRANGER BUT AS IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS MAKING TOO LIBERAL AN OFFER

4931-28257-0029 THE JEW LOOKED PERPLEXED YES SAID SERVADAC WHEN WE HEAR HIS STORY YOU SHALL HEAR IT TOO
4931-28257-0030 ADDED BEN ZOOF IN A VOICE OF IRONY THEY HAD NONE OF THEM LONG TO WAIT FOR WITHIN A FEW MINUTES ROSETTE'S PEEVISH VOICE WAS HEARD CALLING JOSEPH JOSEPH THE PROFESSOR DID NOT OPEN HIS EYES
4931-28257-0031 AND APPEARED TO BE SLUMBERING ON BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS CALLED OUT AGAIN JOSEPH CONFOUND THE FELLOW WHERE IS HE
4931-28257-0032 WHERE'S MY BLACKBOARD JOSEPH QUITE SAFE SIR ANSWERED BEN ZOOF QUICKLY ROSETTE UNCLOSED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON THE ORDERLY'S FACE

4931-28257-0034 TO GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND SERVADAC APPROACHED THE PROFESSOR IN ORDER TO ASSIST HIM IN RISING TO A SITTING POSTURE
4931-28257-0035 IT IS TWELVE YEARS OR MORE SINCE I SAW YOU I HOPE YOU HAVE IMPROVED QUITE A REFORMED CHARACTER SIR I ASSURE YOU SAID SERVADAC SMILING WELL THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE THAT'S RIGHT SAID THE ASTRONOMER WITH FUSSY IMPORTANCE
4931-28257-0036 BUT LET ME HAVE MY COFFEE HE ADDED IMPATIENTLY I CANNOT COLLECT MY THOUGHTS WITHOUT MY COFFEE FORTUNATELY BEN ZOOF APPEARED WITH A GREAT CUP HOT AND STRONG AFTER DRAINING IT WITH MUCH APPARENT RELISH THE PROFESSOR GOT OUT OF BED
4931-28257-0037 WALKED INTO THE COMMON HALL ROUND WHICH HE GLANCED WITH A PRE OCCUPIED AIR AND PROCEEDED TO SEAT HIMSELF IN AN ARMCHAIR THE MOST COMFORTABLE WHICH THE CABIN OF THE DOBRYNA HAD SUPPLIED THEN IN A VOICE FULL OF SATISFACTION
4931-28257-0038 AND THAT INVOLUNTARILY RECALLED THE EXCLAMATIONS OF DELIGHT THAT HAD WOUND UP THE TWO FIRST OF THE MYSTERIOUS DOCUMENTS
4931-28257-0039 HAD DARTED FORWARD BY THE GOD
4931-28257-0040 EUROPE SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR SPRINGING FROM HIS SEAT AS IF HE WERE ELECTRIFIED WHAT DOES THE MAN WANT WITH EUROPE I WANT TO GET THERE SCREECHED THE JEW AND IN SPITE OF EVERY EXERTION TO GET HIM AWAY HE CLUNG MOST TENACIOUSLY TO THE PROFESSOR'S CHAIR
4931-28257-0041 AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IMPLORED FOR NEWS OF EUROPE ROSETTE MADE NO IMMEDIATE REPLY AFTER A MOMENT OR TWO'S REFLECTION HE TURNED TO SERVADAC AND ASKED HIM
4931-28257-0042 THEN TO DAY SAID THE ASTRONOMER SPEAKING WITH THE GREATEST DELIBERATION TO DAY WE ARE JUST THREE MILLIONS OF LEAGUES AWAY FROM EUROPE THE JEW WAS UTTERLY CRESTFALLEN
4931-28257-0043 TO BE VERY IGNORANT OF THE STATE OF THINGS
4931-28257-0044 I CANNOT TELL BUT I WILL TELL YOU ALL THAT WE DO KNOW AND ALL THAT WE HAVE SURMISED AND AS BRIEFLY AS HE COULD HE RELATED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE THE MEMORABLE NIGHT OF THE THIRTY FIRST OF DECEMBER HOW THEY HAD EXPERIENCED THE SHOCK
4931-28257-0045 HOW THE DOBRYNA HAD MADE HER VOYAGE HOW THEY HAD DISCOVERED NOTHING EXCEPT THE FRAGMENTS OF THE OLD CONTINENT AT TUNIS SARDINIA GIBRALTAR AND NOW AT FORMENTERA
4931-28257-0046 AND FINALLY HOW THE SETTLEMENT AT GOURBI ISLAND HAD BEEN ABANDONED FOR THEIR PRESENT QUARTERS AT NINA'S HIVE
4931-28257-0047 OUR SUPPOSITION THE CAPTAIN REPLIED IS THIS WE IMAGINE THAT WE ARE ON A CONSIDERABLE FRAGMENT OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THAT HAS BEEN DETACHED BY COLLISION WITH A PLANET TO WHICH YOU APPEAR TO HAVE GIVEN THE NAME OF GALLIA
4931-28257-0048 BETTER THAN THAT CRIED ROSETTE STARTING TO HIS FEET WITH EXCITEMENT HOW WHY
4931-28257-0049 THERE WAS A COLLISION MY COMET GRAZED THE EARTH AND THE BITS OF THE EARTH WHICH YOU HAVE NAMED WERE CARRIED CLEAN AWAY THEY WERE ALL FAIRLY BEWILDERED WHERE THEN CRIED SERVADAC EAGERLY WHERE ARE WE
4931-28257-0050 YOU ARE ON MY COMET ON GALLIA ITSELF AND THE PROFESSOR GAZED AROUND HIM
