2012-139355-0000 AT DAYBREAK ON THE MORROW THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF JUNE THE CABLES WERE CAST OFF AND THE RAFT CONTINUED ITS JOURNEY DOWN THE RIVER AN EXTRA PASSENGER WAS ON BOARD WHENCE CAME THIS TORRES NO ONE EXACTLY KNEW WHERE WAS HE GOING TO
2012-139355-0001 TO MANAOS HE SAID TORRES WAS CAREFUL TO LET NO SUSPICION OF HIS PAST LIFE ESCAPE HIM NOR OF THE PROFESSION THAT HE HAD FOLLOWED TILL WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE JANGADA HAD GIVEN REFUGE TO AN OLD CAPTAIN OF THE WOODS
2012-139355-0002 IN TAKING HIM ON BOARD THE FAZENDER HAD OBEYED A SENTIMENT OF HUMANITY IN THE MIDST OF THESE VAST AMAZONIAN DESERTS MORE ESPECIALLY AT THE TIME WHEN THE STEAMERS HAD NOT BEGUN TO FURROW THE WATERS
2012-139355-0003 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND MEANS OF SAFE AND RAPID TRANSIT BOATS DID NOT PLY REGULARLY AND IN MOST CASES THE TRAVELER WAS OBLIGED TO WALK ACROSS THE FORESTS THIS IS WHAT TORRES HAD DONE AND WHAT HE WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE DONE
2012-139355-0004 FROM THE MOMENT THAT BENITO HAD EXPLAINED UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS HE HAD MET TORRES THE INTRODUCTION WAS COMPLETE AND HE WAS ABLE TO CONSIDER HIMSELF AS A PASSENGER ON AN ATLANTIC STEAMER
2012-139355-0005 ANSWERING IF ADDRESSED BUT NEVER PROVOKING A REPLY IF HE APPEARED MORE OPEN WITH ANY ONE IT WAS WITH FRAGOSO
2012-139355-0006 THE IDEA OF TAKING PASSAGE ON BOARD THE RAFT MANY TIMES HE ASKED HIM ABOUT THE POSITION OF THE GARRALS AT IQUITOS
2012-139355-0007 DURING THE MORNING THE RAFT PASSED BY THE PICTURESQUE GROUP OF ISLANDS SITUATED IN THE VAST ESTUARY OF THE JAVARY THIS IMPORTANT AFFLUENT OF THE AMAZON COMES FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND FROM SOURCE TO MOUTH
2012-139355-0008 HAS NOT A SINGLE ISLAND NOR A SINGLE RAPID TO CHECK ITS COURSE THE MOUTH IS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET IN WIDTH AND THE RIVER COMES IN SOME MILES ABOVE THE SITE FORMERLY OCCUPIED BY THE TOWN OF THE SAME NAME
2012-139355-0009 WHOSE POSSESSION WAS DISPUTED FOR SO LONG BY SPANIARDS AND PORTUGUESE UP TO THE MORNING OF THE THIRTIETH OF JUNE THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING PARTICULAR TO DISTINGUISH THE VOYAGE
2012-139355-0010 THAT A SINGLE INDIAN COULD MANAGE THE WHOLE
2012-139355-0011 AS THIS KIND OF NAVIGATION IS CALLED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY THAT IS TO SAY CONFIDENCE NAVIGATION THEY HAD PASSED THE ISLAND OF ARARIA THE ARCHIPELAGO OF THE CALDERON ISLANDS THE ISLAND OF CAPIATU
2012-139355-0012 AND MANY OTHERS WHOSE NAMES HAVE NOT YET COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF GEOGRAPHERS
2012-139355-0013 WHERE THEY HALTED FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS
2012-139355-0014 AND BROUGHT BACK SOME FEATHERED GAME WHICH WAS WELL RECEIVED IN THE LARDER AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAD GOT AN ANIMAL OF WHOM A NATURALIST WOULD HAVE MADE MORE THAN DID THE COOK IT WAS A CREATURE OF A DARK COLOR SOMETHING LIKE A LARGE NEWFOUNDLAND DOG
2012-139355-0015 THE ANT EATER LOOKED SUPERB WITH HIS LONG TAIL AND GRIZZLY HAIR WITH HIS POINTED SNOUT WHICH IS PLUNGED INTO THE ANT HILLS WHOSE INSECTS FORM ITS PRINCIPAL FOOD AND HIS LONG THIN PAWS
2012-139355-0016 ARMED WITH SHARP NAILS FIVE INCHES LONG AND WHICH CAN SHUT UP LIKE THE FINGERS OF ONE'S HAND BUT WHAT A HAND WAS THIS HAND OF THE ANT EATER WHEN IT HAS GOT HOLD OF ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO CUT IT OFF TO MAKE IT LET GO
2012-139355-0017 IT IS OF THIS HAND THAT THE TRAVELER EMILE CARREY HAS SO JUSTLY OBSERVED THE TIGER HIMSELF WOULD PERISH IN ITS GRASP
2012-139355-0018 JURUPARI RITA MARACANATENA AND CURURU SAPO
2012-139355-0019 THE COLORATION OF THESE WATERS IS A VERY CURIOUS PHENOMENON IT IS PECULIAR TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THESE TRIBUTARIES OF THE AMAZON WHICH DIFFER GREATLY IN IMPORTANCE
2012-139355-0020 FOR IT COULD BE CLEARLY SEEN ON THE SURFACE OF THE WHITISH WATERS OF THE RIVER THEY HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THIS COLORING IN MANY WAYS SAID HE BUT I DO NOT THINK THE MOST LEARNED HAVE YET ARRIVED AT A SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION
2012-139355-0021 THE WATERS ARE REALLY BLACK WITH A MAGNIFICENT REFLECTION OF GOLD REPLIED MINHA SHOWING A LIGHT REDDISH BROWN CLOTH WHICH WAS FLOATING LEVEL WITH THE JANGADA
2012-139355-0022 AND HUMBOLDT HAS ALREADY OBSERVED THE CURIOUS REFLECTION THAT YOU HAVE BUT ON LOOKING AT IT ATTENTIVELY YOU WILL SEE THAT IT IS RATHER THE COLOR OF SEPIA WHICH PERVADES THE WHOLE GOOD EXCLAIMED BENITO
2012-139355-0023 ANOTHER PHENOMENON ON WHICH THE SAVANTS ARE NOT AGREED PERHAPS SAID FRAGOSO THEY MIGHT ASK THE OPINIONS OF THE CAYMANS DOLPHINS AND MANATEES FOR THEY CERTAINLY PREFER THE BLACK WATERS TO THE OTHERS TO ENJOY THEMSELVES IN
2012-139355-0024 IS THE COLORATION DUE TO THE HYDROCARBONS WHICH THE WATERS HOLD IN SOLUTION OR IS IT BECAUSE THEY FLOW THROUGH DISTRICTS OF PEAT COAL AND ANTHRACITE OR SHOULD WE NOT RATHER ATTRIBUTE IT TO THE ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF MINUTE PLANTS WHICH THEY BEAR ALONG
2012-139355-0025 THERE IS NOTHING CERTAIN IN THE MATTER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE EXCELLENT TO DRINK OF A FRESHNESS QUITE ENVIABLE FOR THE CLIMATE AND WITHOUT AFTER TASTE AND PERFECTLY HARMLESS
2012-139355-0026 WHERE THEY TURN OUT IN THOUSANDS THOSE LONG STRINGS OF BEADS WHICH ARE MADE FROM THE SCALES OF THE COCO DE PIASSABA THIS TRADE IS HERE EXTENSIVELY FOLLOWED IT MAY PERHAPS SEEM SINGULAR THAT THE ANCIENT LORDS OF THE COUNTRY
2012-139355-0027 BUT AFTER ALL WHY NOT THESE INDIANS ARE NO LONGER THE INDIANS OF DAYS GONE BY INSTEAD OF BEING CLOTHED IN THE NATIONAL FASHION WITH A FRONTLET OF MACAW FEATHERS BOW AND BLOW TUBE HAVE THEY NOT ADOPTED THE AMERICAN COSTUME OF WHITE COTTON TROUSERS
2012-139355-0028 AT PRESENT THE CAPITAL OF THE UPPER AMAZON IT BEGAN AS A SIMPLE MISSION FOUNDED BY THE PORTUGUESE CARMELITES ABOUT SIXTEEN NINETY TWO AND AFTERWARD ACQUIRED BY THE JESUIT MISSIONARIES FROM THE BEGINNING
2012-139355-0029 IT HAS BEEN THE COUNTRY OF THE OMAGUAS WHOSE NAME MEANS FLAT HEADS AND IS DERIVED FROM THE BARBAROUS CUSTOM OF THE NATIVE MOTHERS OF SQUEEZING THE HEADS OF THEIR NEWBORN CHILDREN BETWEEN TWO PLATES SO AS TO GIVE THEM AN OBLONG SKULL
2012-139355-0030 WHICH WAS THEN THE FASHION LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAS CHANGED HEADS HAVE RE TAKEN THEIR NATURAL FORM AND THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF THE ANCIENT DEFORMITY IN THE SKULLS OF THE CHAPLET MAKERS
2012-139355-0031 TORRES ALSO REMAINED ON BOARD AND SHOWED NO DESIRE TO VISIT SAN PABLO D'OLIVENCA WHICH HE DID NOT HOWEVER SEEM TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH ASSUREDLY IF THE ADVENTURER WAS TACITURN HE WAS NOT INQUISITIVE
2012-139355-0032 BENITO HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN DOING A LITTLE BARTERING
2012-139355-0033 HE AND THE FAMILY RECEIVED AN EXCELLENT RECEPTION FROM THE PRINCIPAL AUTHORITIES OF THE TOWN THE COMMANDANT OF THE PLACE AND THE CHIEF OF THE CUSTOM HOUSE WHOSE FUNCTIONS DID NOT IN THE LEAST PREVENT THEM FROM ENGAGING IN TRADE
2012-139355-0034 THEY EVEN INTRUSTED THE YOUNG MERCHANT WITH A FEW PRODUCTS OF THE COUNTRY FOR HIM TO DISPOSE OF ON THEIR ACCOUNT AT MANAOS AND BELEM THE TOWN IS COMPOSED OF SOME SIXTY HOUSES ARRANGED ON THE PLAIN WHICH HEREABOUTS CROWNS THE RIVER BANK
2012-139355-0035 THE COMMANDANT HIS LIEUTENANT AND THE HEAD OF THE POLICE ACCEPTED AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE FAMILY AND THEY WERE RECEIVED BY JOAM GARRAL WITH THE RESPECT DUE TO THEIR RANK DURING DINNER TORRES SHOWED HIMSELF MORE TALKATIVE THAN USUAL
2012-139355-0036 HE SPOKE ABOUT SOME OF HIS EXCURSIONS INTO THE INTERIOR OF BRAZIL LIKE A MAN WHO KNEW THE COUNTRY
2012-139355-0037 IF HIS COLLEAGUE WOULD BE THERE AT THIS TIME AND IF THE JUDGE THE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF THE PROVINCE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ABSENT HIMSELF AT THIS PERIOD OF THE HOT SEASON IT SEEMED THAT IN PUTTING THIS SERIES OF QUESTIONS TORRES LOOKED AT JOAM GARRAL
2012-139355-0038 IT WAS MARKED ENOUGH FOR EVEN BENITO TO NOTICE IT NOT WITHOUT SURPRISE AND HE OBSERVED THAT HIS FATHER GAVE PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE QUESTIONS SO CURIOUSLY PROPOUNDED BY TORRES
2012-139355-0039 IN ALL PROBABILITY THE RAFT WOULD ARRIVE BEFORE THE TOWN IN SEVEN WEEKS OR A LITTLE LATER
2012-139355-0040 THE GUESTS OF THE FAZENDER TOOK LEAVE OF THE GARRAL FAMILY TOWARD THE EVENING
2012-139355-0041 WHICH IS ITSELF AN AFFLUENT OF THE AMAZON A PECULIAR PHENOMENON FOR THE RIVER DISPLACES ITSELF TO FEED ITS OWN TRIBUTARIES TOWARD THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE GIANT RAFT PASSED THE MOUTH
2012-139355-0042 WHICH BRINGS ITS MAGNIFICENT BLACK WATERS FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND DISCHARGES THEM INTO THE MAIN ARTERY BY A MOUTH OF FOUR HUNDRED METERS IN EXTENT AFTER HAVING WATERED THE TERRITORIES OF THE CULINO INDIANS A NUMBER OF ISLANDS WERE BREASTED
2012-139355-0043 PIMAICAIRA CATURIA CHICO MOTACHINA
