7555-101283-0000 THE BOYS WITH THE GOLDEN STARS ONCE UPON A TIME WHAT HAPPENED DID HAPPEN AND IF IT HAD NOT HAPPENED YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD THIS STORY WELL ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED AN EMPEROR WHO HAD HALF A WORLD ALL TO HIMSELF TO RULE OVER
7555-101283-0001 AND IN THIS WORLD DWELT AN OLD HERD AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR THREE DAUGHTERS ANNA STANA AND LAPTITZA ANNA THE ELDEST WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT WHEN SHE TOOK THE SHEEP TO PASTURE THEY FORGOT TO EAT AS LONG AS SHE WAS WALKING WITH THEM
7555-101283-0002 STANA THE SECOND WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT WHEN SHE WAS DRIVING THE FLOCK THE WOLVES PROTECTED THE SHEEP BUT LAPTITZA THE YOUNGEST WITH A SKIN AS WHITE AS THE FOAM ON THE MILK AND WITH HAIR AS SOFT AS THE FINEST LAMB'S WOOL
7555-101283-0003 WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS BOTH HER SISTERS PUT TOGETHER AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE ALONE COULD BE ONE SUMMER DAY WHEN THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE POURING DOWN ON THE EARTH THE THREE SISTERS WENT TO THE WOOD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE MOUNTAIN TO PICK STRAWBERRIES
7555-101283-0004 SO LOUD THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A WHOLE ARMY WAS RIDING BY BUT IT WAS ONLY THE EMPEROR GOING TO HUNT WITH HIS FRIENDS AND ATTENDANTS THEY WERE ALL FINE HANDSOME YOUNG MEN WHO SAT THEIR HORSES AS IF THEY WERE PART OF THEM BUT THE FINEST AND HANDSOMEST OF ALL
7555-101283-0005 WAS THE YOUNG EMPEROR HIMSELF AS THEY DREW NEAR THE THREE SISTERS AND MARKED THEIR BEAUTY THEY CHECKED THEIR HORSES AND RODE SLOWLY BY LISTEN SISTERS SAID ANNA AS THEY PASSED ON
7555-101283-0006 IF ONE OF THOSE YOUNG MEN SHOULD MAKE ME HIS WIFE I WOULD BAKE HIM A LOAF OF BREAD WHICH SHOULD KEEP HIM YOUNG AND BRAVE FOR EVER AND IF I SAID STANA SHOULD BE THE ONE CHOSEN I WOULD WEAVE MY HUSBAND A SHIRT
7555-101283-0007 WHICH WILL KEEP HIM UNSCATHED WHEN HE FIGHTS WITH DRAGONS WHEN HE GOES THROUGH WATER HE WILL NEVER EVEN BE WET OR IF THROUGH FIRE IT WILL NOT SCORCH HIM AND I SAID LAPTITZA WILL GIVE THE MAN WHO CHOOSES ME
7555-101283-0008 TWO BOYS TWINS EACH WITH A GOLDEN STAR ON HIS FOREHEAD AS BRIGHT AS THOSE IN THE SKY AND THOUGH THEY SPOKE LOW THE YOUNG MEN HEARD AND TURNED THEIR HORSES HEADS
7555-101283-0009 I TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD AND MINE SHALL YOU BE MOST LOVELY OF EMPRESSES CRIED THE EMPEROR AND SWUNG LAPTITZA AND HER STRAWBERRIES ON THE HORSE BEFORE HIM AND I WILL HAVE YOU AND I YOU EXCLAIMED TWO OF HIS FRIENDS
7555-101283-0010 AND THEY ALL RODE BACK TO THE PALACE TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY TOOK PLACE AND FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS THERE WAS NOTHING BUT FEASTING OVER THE WHOLE KINGDOM AND WHEN THE REJOICINGS WERE OVER
7555-101283-0011 THE NEWS WAS IN EVERYBODY'S MOUTH THAT ANNA HAD SENT FOR CORN AND HAD MADE THE LOAF OF WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN AT THE STRAWBERRY BEDS AND THEN MORE DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED AND THIS RUMOUR WAS SUCCEEDED BY ANOTHER ONE THAT STANA HAD PROCURED SOME FLAX
7555-101283-0012 AND HAD DRIED IT AND COMBED IT AND SPUN IT INTO LINEN AND SEWED IT HERSELF INTO THE SHIRT OF WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN OVER THE STRAWBERRY BEDS NOW THE EMPEROR HAD A STEPMOTHER AND SHE HAD A DAUGHTER BY HER FIRST HUSBAND WHO LIVED WITH HER IN THE PALACE
7555-101283-0013 THE GIRL'S MOTHER HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HER DAUGHTER WOULD BE EMPRESS AND NOT THE MILKWHITE MAIDEN THE CHILD OF A MERE SHEPHERD SO SHE HATED THE GIRL WITH ALL HER HEART AND ONLY BIDED HER TIME TO DO HER ILL
7555-101283-0014 BUT SHE COULD DO NOTHING AS LONG AS THE EMPEROR REMAINED WITH HIS WIFE NIGHT AND DAY AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT SHE COULD DO TO GET HIM AWAY FROM HER AT LAST WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE HAD FAILED SHE MANAGED TO MAKE HER BROTHER
7555-101283-0015 WHO WAS KING OF THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY DECLARE WAR AGAINST THE EMPEROR AND BESIEGE SOME OF THE FRONTIER TOWNS WITH A LARGE ARMY THIS TIME HER SCHEME WAS SUCCESSFUL THE YOUNG EMPEROR SPRANG UP IN WRATH THE MOMENT HE HEARD THE NEWS AND VOWED THAT NOTHING
7555-101283-0016 AND HASTILY ASSEMBLING WHATEVER SOLDIERS HAPPENED TO BE AT HAND
7555-101283-0017 THE OTHER KING HAD NOT RECKONED ON THE SWIFTNESS OF HIS MOVEMENTS AND WAS NOT READY TO RECEIVE HIM
7555-101283-0018 AND REACHED THE PALACE ON THE THIRD DAY BUT EARLY THAT MORNING WHEN THE STARS WERE GROWING PALE IN THE SKY TWO LITTLE BOYS WITH GOLDEN HAIR AND STARS ON THEIR FOREHEADS WERE BORN TO LAPTITZA
7555-101283-0019 AND THE STEPMOTHER WHO WAS WATCHING TOOK THEM AWAY AND DUG A HOLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PALACE UNDER THE WINDOWS OF THE EMPEROR AND PUT THEM IN IT
7555-101283-0020 THE EMPEROR CAME INTO THE PALACE AND WHEN THEY TOLD HIM THE NEWS HE WENT STRAIGHT TO LAPTITZA'S ROOM NO WORDS WERE NEEDED HE SAW WITH HIS OWN EYES THAT LAPTITZA HAD NOT KEPT THE PROMISE SHE HAD MADE AT THE STRAWBERRY BEDS AND
7555-101283-0021 THOUGH IT NEARLY BROKE HIS HEART HE MUST GIVE ORDERS FOR HER PUNISHMENT SO HE WENT OUT SADLY AND TOLD HIS GUARDS THAT THE EMPRESS WAS TO BE BURIED IN THE EARTH UP TO HER NECK
7555-101283-0022 NOT MANY DAYS AFTER THE STEPMOTHER'S WISH WAS FULFILLED THE EMPEROR TOOK HER DAUGHTER TO WIFE AND AGAIN THE REJOICINGS LASTED FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS
7555-101283-0023 THE POOR LITTLE BABIES HAD FOUND NO REST EVEN IN THEIR GRAVES IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN BURIED THERE SPRANG UP TWO BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ASPENS AND THE STEPMOTHER WHO HATED THE SIGHT OF THE TREES WHICH REMINDED HER OF HER CRIME
7555-101283-0024 GAVE ORDERS THAT THEY SHOULD BE UPROOTED
7555-101283-0025 LET THEM ALONE I LIKE TO SEE THEM THERE THEY ARE THE FINEST ASPENS I HAVE EVER BEHELD AND THE ASPENS GREW AS NO ASPENS HAD EVER GROWN BEFORE IN EACH DAY THEY ADDED A YEAR'S GROWTH
7555-101283-0026 AND EACH NIGHT THEY ADDED A YEAR'S GROWTH AND AT DAWN WHEN THE STARS FADED OUT OF THE SKY THEY GREW THREE YEARS GROWTH IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AND THEIR BOUGHS SWEPT ACROSS THE PALACE WINDOWS AND WHEN THE WIND MOVED THEM SOFTLY
7555-101283-0027 THE STEPMOTHER KNEW WHAT IT ALL MEANT AND HER MIND NEVER CEASED FROM TRYING TO INVENT SOME WAY OF DESTROYING THE TREES IT WAS NOT AN EASY THING BUT A WOMAN'S WILL CAN PRESS MILK OUT OF A STONE AND HER CUNNING WILL OVERCOME HEROES
7555-101283-0028 WHAT CRAFT WILL NOT DO SOFT WORDS MAY ATTAIN AND IF THESE DO NOT SUCCEED THERE STILL REMAINS THE RESOURCE OF TEARS ONE MORNING THE EMPRESS SAT ON THE EDGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BED
7555-101283-0029 AND BEGAN TO COAX HIM WITH ALL SORTS OF PRETTY WAYS IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THE BAIT TOOK BUT AT LENGTH EVEN EMPERORS ARE ONLY MEN WELL WELL HE SAID AT LAST HAVE YOUR WAY AND CUT DOWN THE TREES
7555-101283-0030 BUT OUT OF ONE THEY SHALL MAKE A BED FOR ME AND OUT OF THE OTHER ONE FOR YOU AND WITH THIS THE EMPRESS WAS FORCED TO BE CONTENT
7555-101283-0031 YET HE FELT A KIND OF CALM THAT WAS QUITE NEW TO HIM
7555-101283-0032 WHEN THE EMPEROR WAS FAST ASLEEP THE BED BEGAN TO CRACK LOUDLY AND TO THE EMPRESS EACH CRACK HAD A MEANING
7555-101283-0033 IS IT TOO HEAVY FOR YOU LITTLE BROTHER ASKED ONE OF THE BEDS OH NO IT IS NOT HEAVY AT ALL ANSWERED THE BED IN WHICH THE EMPEROR WAS SLEEPING I FEEL NOTHING BUT JOY NOW THAT MY BELOVED FATHER RESTS OVER ME
7555-101283-0034 IT IS VERY HEAVY FOR ME SAID THE OTHER BED FOR ON ME LIES AN EVIL SOUL
7555-101283-0035 THE EMPRESS LISTENING ALL THE WHILE BY DAYBREAK THE EMPRESS HAD DETERMINED HOW TO GET RID OF THE BEDS SHE WOULD HAVE TWO OTHERS MADE EXACTLY LIKE THEM AND WHEN THE EMPEROR HAD GONE HUNTING THEY SHOULD BE PLACED IN HIS ROOM
7555-101283-0036 THIS WAS DONE AND THE ASPEN BEDS WERE BURNT IN A LARGE FIRE TILL ONLY A LITTLE HEAP OF ASHES WAS LEFT YET WHILE THEY WERE BURNING
7555-101283-0037 AND SCATTERED THEM TO THE FOUR WINDS SO THAT THEY MIGHT BLOW OVER FRESH LANDS AND FRESH SEAS AND NOTHING REMAIN OF THEM BUT SHE HAD NOT SEEN
7555-101283-0038 TWO SPARKS FLEW UP AND AFTER FLOATING IN THE AIR FOR A FEW MOMENTS FELL DOWN INTO THE GREAT RIVER THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY HERE THE SPARKS HAD TURNED INTO TWO LITTLE FISHES WITH GOLDEN SCALES AND ONE WAS SO EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER
7555-101283-0039 EARLY ONE MORNING THE EMPEROR'S FISHERMEN WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER TO GET SOME FISH FOR THEIR MASTER'S BREAKFAST AND CAST THEIR NETS INTO THE STREAM
7555-101283-0040 AS THE LAST STAR TWINKLED OUT OF THE SKY THEY DREW THEM IN AND AMONG THE MULTITUDE OF FISHES LAY TWO WITH SCALES OF GOLD SUCH AS NO MAN HAD EVER LOOKED ON THEY ALL GATHERED ROUND AND WONDERED
7555-101283-0041 AND GIVE THEM AS A PRESENT TO THE EMPEROR DO NOT TAKE US THERE FOR THAT IS WHENCE WE CAME AND YONDER LIES OUR DESTRUCTION SAID ONE OF THE FISHES BUT WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH YOU ASKED THE FISHERMAN
7555-101283-0042 GO AND COLLECT ALL THE DEW THAT LIES ON THE LEAVES AND LET US SWIM IN IT THEN LAY US IN THE SUN
7555-101283-0043 AND WHEN HE CAME BACK WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAW WHY TWO BOYS
7555-101283-0044 AND EACH SO LIKE THE OTHER
7555-101283-0045 EVERY ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THEM FOR TWINS THE BOYS GREW FAST
7555-101283-0046 AND IN EVERY NIGHT ANOTHER YEAR'S GROWTH BUT AT DAWN WHEN THE STARS WERE FADING THEY GREW THREE YEARS GROWTH IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AND THEY GREW IN OTHER THINGS BESIDES HEIGHT TOO THRICE IN AGE AND THRICE IN WISDOM
7555-101283-0047 AND THRICE IN KNOWLEDGE AND WHEN THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS HAD PASSED THEY WERE TWELVE YEARS IN AGE TWENTY FOUR IN STRENGTH AND THIRTY SIX IN WISDOM
7555-101283-0048 WHICH HALF COVERED THEIR FACES AND COMPLETELY HID THEIR GOLDEN HAIR AND THE STARS ON THEIR FOREHEADS AND LED THEM TO THE COURT BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVED THERE IT WAS MIDDAY AND THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHARGES WENT UP TO AN OFFICIAL WHO WAS STANDING ABOUT
7555-101283-0049 WE WISH TO SPEAK WITH THE EMPEROR SAID ONE OF THE BOYS YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL HE HAS FINISHED HIS DINNER REPLIED THE PORTER NO WHILE HE IS EATING IT SAID THE SECOND BOY STEPPING ACROSS THE THRESHOLD
7555-101283-0050 THE ATTENDANTS ALL RAN FORWARD TO THRUST SUCH IMPUDENT YOUNGSTERS OUTSIDE THE PALACE BUT THE BOYS SLIPPED THROUGH THEIR FINGERS LIKE QUICKSILVER AND ENTERED A LARGE HALL WHERE THE EMPEROR WAS DINING SURROUNDED BY HIS WHOLE COURT WE DESIRE TO ENTER
7555-101283-0051 SAID ONE OF THE PRINCES SHARPLY TO A SERVANT WHO STOOD NEAR THE DOOR THAT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
7555-101283-0052 LET US SEE SAID THE SECOND PRINCE PUSHING THE SERVANTS TO RIGHT AND LEFT BUT THE SERVANTS WERE MANY AND THE PRINCES ONLY TWO THERE WAS THE NOISE OF A STRUGGLE WHICH REACHED THE EMPEROR'S EARS WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED HE ANGRILY
7555-101283-0053 THE PRINCES STOPPED AT THE SOUND OF THEIR FATHER'S VOICE TWO BOYS WHO WANT TO FORCE THEIR WAY IN REPLIED ONE OF THE SERVANTS APPROACHING THE EMPEROR
7555-101283-0054 SAID THE EMPEROR ALL IN ONE BREATH WE KNOW NOT O MIGHTY EMPEROR ANSWERED THE SERVANT
7555-101283-0055 AND THEY ARE AS PROUD AS THEY ARE STRONG FOR THEY WILL NOT TAKE THEIR CAPS FROM THEIR HEADS THE EMPEROR AS HE LISTENED GREW RED WITH ANGER THRUST THEM OUT CRIED HE SET THE DOGS AFTER THEM
7555-101283-0056 LEAVE US ALONE AND WE WILL GO QUIETLY SAID THE PRINCES
7555-101283-0057 WEEPING SILENTLY AT THE HARSH WORDS THEY HAD ALMOST REACHED THE GATES WHEN A SERVANT RAN UP TO THEM THE EMPEROR COMMANDS YOU TO RETURN PANTED HE THE EMPRESS WISHES TO SEE YOU THE PRINCES THOUGHT A MOMENT
7555-101283-0058 THEN THEY WENT BACK THE WAY THEY HAD COME AND WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE EMPEROR THEIR CAPS STILL ON THEIR HEADS HE SAT AT THE TOP OF A LONG TABLE COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND FILLED WITH GUESTS AND BESIDE HIM SAT THE EMPRESS
7555-101283-0059 SUPPORTED BY TWELVE CUSHIONS WHEN THE PRINCES ENTERED ONE OF THE CUSHIONS FELL DOWN AND THERE REMAINED ONLY ELEVEN TAKE OFF YOUR CAPS SAID ONE OF THE COURTIERS A COVERED HEAD IS AMONG MEN A SIGN OF HONOUR WE WISH TO SEEM WHAT WE ARE
7555-101283-0060 STAY AS YOU ARE BUT TELL ME
7555-101283-0061 WE ARE TWINS TWO SHOOTS FROM ONE STEM WHICH HAS BEEN BROKEN AND HALF LIES IN THE GROUND AND HALF SITS AT THE HEAD OF THIS TABLE WE HAVE TRAVELLED A LONG WAY WE HAVE SPOKEN IN THE RUSTLE OF THE WIND
7555-101283-0062 HAVE WHISPERED IN THE WOOD WE HAVE SUNG IN THE WATERS BUT NOW WE WISH TO TELL YOU A STORY WHICH YOU KNOW WITHOUT KNOWING IT IN THE SPEECH OF MEN AND A SECOND CUSHION FELL DOWN LET THEM TAKE THEIR SILLINESS HOME
7555-101283-0063 SAID THE EMPRESS OH NO LET THEM GO ON SAID THE EMPEROR YOU WISHED TO SEE THEM BUT I WISH TO HEAR THEM GO ON BOYS SING ME THE STORY THE EMPRESS WAS SILENT BUT THE PRINCES BEGAN TO SING THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
7555-101283-0064 THERE WAS ONCE AN EMPEROR BEGAN THEY AND THE THIRD CUSHION FELL DOWN WHEN THEY REACHED THE WARLIKE EXPEDITION OF THE EMPEROR THREE OF THE CUSHIONS FELL DOWN AT ONCE AND WHEN THE TALE WAS FINISHED THERE WERE NO MORE CUSHIONS UNDER THE EMPRESS
7555-101283-0065 BUT THE MOMENT THAT THEY LIFTED THEIR CAPS AND SHOWED THEIR GOLDEN HAIR AND THE GOLDEN STARS THE EYES OF THE EMPEROR AND OF ALL HIS GUESTS WERE BENT ON THEM AND THEY COULD HARDLY BEAR THE POWER OF SO MANY GLANCES
