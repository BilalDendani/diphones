310-129055-0000 IN WHICH THE READER IS INTRODUCED TO THE VERY BEST OF COMPANY AT LAST BECKY'S KINDNESS AND ATTENTION TO THE CHIEF OF HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY
310-129055-0001 WERE DESTINED TO MEET WITH AN EXCEEDING GREAT REWARD A REWARD WHICH THOUGH CERTAINLY SOMEWHAT UNSUBSTANTIAL THE LITTLE WOMAN COVETED WITH GREATER EAGERNESS THAN MORE POSITIVE BENEFITS
310-129055-0002 IF SHE DID NOT WISH TO LEAD A VIRTUOUS LIFE AT LEAST SHE DESIRED TO ENJOY A CHARACTER FOR VIRTUE AND WE KNOW THAT NO LADY IN THE GENTEEL WORLD
310-129055-0003 UNTIL SHE HAS PUT ON A TRAIN AND FEATHERS AND HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO HER SOVEREIGN AT COURT FROM THAT AUGUST INTERVIEW THEY COME OUT STAMPED AS HONEST WOMEN THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN GIVES THEM A CERTIFICATE OF VIRTUE
310-129055-0004 AND AS DUBIOUS GOODS OR LETTERS ARE PASSED THROUGH AN OVEN AT QUARANTINE SPRINKLED WITH
310-129055-0005 MANY A LADY WHOSE REPUTATION WOULD BE DOUBTFUL OTHERWISE AND LIABLE TO GIVE INFECTION PASSES THROUGH THE WHOLESOME ORDEAL OF THE ROYAL PRESENCE AND ISSUES FROM IT FREE FROM ALL TAINT
310-129055-0006 MY LADY TUFTO MISSUS BUTE CRAWLEY IN THE COUNTRY AND OTHER LADIES WHO HAD COME INTO CONTACT WITH MISSUS RAWDON CRAWLEY TO CRY FIE AT THE IDEA OF THE ODIOUS LITTLE ADVENTURESS MAKING HER CURTSEY BEFORE THE SOVEREIGN
310-129055-0007 AND TO DECLARE THAT IF DEAR GOOD QUEEN CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN ALIVE SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ADMITTED SUCH AN EXTREMELY ILL REGULATED PERSONAGE
310-129055-0008 BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IT WAS THE FIRST GENTLEMAN IN EUROPE IN WHOSE HIGH PRESENCE MISSUS RAWDON PASSED HER EXAMINATION AND AS IT WERE TOOK HER DEGREE IN REPUTATION IT SURELY MUST BE FLAT DISLOYALTY
310-129055-0009 TO DOUBT ANY MORE ABOUT HER VIRTUE I FOR MY PART LOOK BACK WITH LOVE AND AWE TO THAT GREAT CHARACTER IN HISTORY AH WHAT A HIGH AND NOBLE APPRECIATION OF GENTLEWOMANHOOD
310-129055-0010 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN IN VANITY FAIR WHEN THAT REVERED AND AUGUST BEING WAS INVESTED BY THE UNIVERSAL ACCLAIM OF THE REFINED AND EDUCATED PORTION OF THIS EMPIRE WITH THE TITLE OF PREMIER GENTILHOMME
310-129055-0011 OF HIS KINGDOM DO YOU REMEMBER
310-129055-0012 THE HYPOCRITE BEING ACTED ELLISTON BEING MANAGER DOWTON AND LISTON PERFORMERS TWO BOYS HAD LEAVE FROM THEIR LOYAL MASTERS TO GO OUT FROM SLAUGHTER HOUSE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE EDUCATED
310-129055-0013 AND TO APPEAR ON DRURY LANE STAGE AMONGST A CROWD WHICH ASSEMBLED THERE TO GREET THE KING THE KING THERE HE WAS BEEFEATERS WERE BEFORE THE AUGUST BOX THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE LORD OF THE POWDER CLOSET
310-129055-0014 AND OTHER GREAT OFFICERS OF STATE WERE BEHIND THE CHAIR ON WHICH HE SAT HE SAT FLORID OF FACE PORTLY OF PERSON COVERED WITH ORDERS AND IN A RICH CURLING HEAD OF HAIR HOW WE SANG GOD SAVE HIM
310-129055-0015 HOW THE HOUSE ROCKED AND SHOUTED WITH THAT MAGNIFICENT MUSIC HOW THEY CHEERED AND CRIED AND WAVED HANDKERCHIEFS LADIES WEPT
310-129055-0016 SOME FAINTED WITH EMOTION PEOPLE WERE SUFFOCATED IN THE PIT SHRIEKS AND GROANS RISING UP AMIDST THE WRITHING AND SHOUTING MASS THERE OF HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE AND INDEED SHOWED THEMSELVES ALMOST TO BE READY TO DIE FOR HIM
310-129055-0017 YES WE SAW HIM FATE CANNOT DEPRIVE US OF THAT OTHERS HAVE SEEN NAPOLEON SOME FEW STILL EXIST WHO HAVE BEHELD FREDERICK THE GREAT DOCTOR JOHNSON
310-129055-0018 BE IT OUR REASONABLE BOAST TO OUR CHILDREN THAT WE SAW GEORGE THE GOOD THE MAGNIFICENT THE GREAT WELL THERE CAME A HAPPY DAY IN MISSUS RAWDON CRAWLEY'S EXISTENCE
310-129055-0019 WHEN THIS ANGEL WAS ADMITTED INTO THE PARADISE OF A COURT WHICH SHE COVETED
310-129055-0020 IN THEIR GREAT FAMILY CARRIAGE JUST NEWLY BUILT AND READY FOR THE BARONET'S ASSUMPTION OF THE OFFICE OF HIGH SHERIFF OF HIS COUNTY DROVE UP TO THE LITTLE HOUSE IN CURZON STREET TO THE EDIFICATION OF RAGGLES
310-129055-0021 WHO WAS WATCHING FROM HIS GREENGROCER'S SHOP AND SAW FINE PLUMES WITHIN AND ENORMOUS BUNCHES OF FLOWERS IN THE BREASTS OF THE NEW LIVERY COATS OF THE FOOTMEN SIR PITT IN A GLITTERING UNIFORM
310-129055-0022 DESCENDED AND WENT INTO CURZON STREET HIS SWORD BETWEEN HIS LEGS LITTLE RAWDON STOOD WITH HIS FACE AGAINST THE PARLOUR WINDOW PANES SMILING AND NODDING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO HIS AUNT IN THE CARRIAGE WITHIN
310-129055-0023 AND PRESENTLY SIR PITT ISSUED FORTH FROM THE HOUSE AGAIN LEADING FORTH A LADY WITH GRAND FEATHERS COVERED IN A WHITE SHAWL AND HOLDING UP DAINTILY A TRAIN OF MAGNIFICENT BROCADE SHE STEPPED INTO THE VEHICLE
310-129055-0024 AS IF SHE WERE A PRINCESS AND ACCUSTOMED ALL HER LIFE TO GO TO COURT SMILING GRACIOUSLY ON THE FOOTMAN AT THE DOOR AND ON SIR PITT WHO FOLLOWED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE THEN RAWDON FOLLOWED IN HIS OLD GUARDS UNIFORM
310-129055-0025 WHICH HAD GROWN WOEFULLY SHABBY AND WAS MUCH TOO TIGHT HE WAS TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE PROCESSION AND WAITED UPON HIS SOVEREIGN IN A CAB BUT THAT HIS GOOD NATURED SISTER IN LAW INSISTED THAT THEY SHOULD BE A FAMILY PARTY THE COACH WAS LARGE
310-129055-0026 THE LADIES NOT VERY BIG THEY WOULD HOLD THEIR TRAINS IN THEIR LAPS FINALLY THE FOUR WENT FRATERNALLY TOGETHER AND THEIR CARRIAGE PRESENTLY JOINED THE LINE OF ROYAL EQUIPAGES WHICH WAS MAKING ITS WAY DOWN PICCADILLY
310-129055-0027 AND SAINT JAMES'S STREET TOWARDS THE OLD BRICK PALACE WHERE THE STAR OF BRUNSWICK WAS IN WAITING TO RECEIVE HIS NOBLES AND GENTLEFOLKS BECKY FELT AS IF SHE COULD BLESS THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS
310-129055-0028 SO ELATED WAS SHE IN SPIRIT AND SO STRONG A SENSE HAD SHE OF THE DIGNIFIED POSITION WHICH SHE HAD AT LAST ATTAINED IN LIFE EVEN OUR BECKY HAD HER WEAKNESSES AND AS ONE OFTEN SEES HOW MEN PRIDE THEMSELVES UPON EXCELLENCES
310-129055-0029 WHICH OTHERS ARE SLOW TO PERCEIVE HOW FOR INSTANCE COMUS FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT HE IS THE GREATEST TRAGIC ACTOR IN ENGLAND HOW BROWN THE FAMOUS NOVELIST LONGS TO BE CONSIDERED NOT A MAN OF GENIUS BUT A MAN OF FASHION
310-129055-0030 SO TO BE AND TO BE THOUGHT A RESPECTABLE WOMAN WAS BECKY'S AIM IN LIFE AND SHE GOT UP THE GENTEEL WITH AMAZING ASSIDUITY READINESS AND SUCCESS WE HAVE SAID THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE A FINE LADY
310-129055-0031 AND FORGOT THAT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THE CHEST AT HOME DUNS ROUND THE GATE TRADESMEN TO COAX AND WHEEDLE NO GROUND TO WALK UPON IN A WORD AND AS SHE WENT TO COURT IN THE CARRIAGE THE FAMILY CARRIAGE
310-129055-0032 SHE ADOPTED A DEMEANOUR SO GRAND SELF SATISFIED DELIBERATE AND IMPOSING THAT IT MADE EVEN LADY JANE LAUGH SHE WALKED INTO THE ROYAL APARTMENTS WITH A TOSS OF THE HEAD WHICH WOULD HAVE BEFITTED AN EMPRESS
310-129055-0033 AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HAD SHE BEEN ONE SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME THE CHARACTER PERFECTLY
310-129055-0034 OF HER PRESENTATION TO THE SOVEREIGN
310-129055-0035 SOME LADIES WE MAY HAVE SEEN WE WHO WEAR STARS AND CORDONS AND ATTEND THE SAINT JAMES'S ASSEMBLIES OR WE WHO IN MUDDY BOOTS DAWDLE UP AND DOWN PALL MALL AND PEEP INTO THE COACHES AS THEY DRIVE UP WITH THE GREAT FOLKS IN THEIR FEATHERS SOME LADIES OF FASHION
310-129055-0036 AS THE LACED JACKETED BAND OF THE LIFE GUARDS ARE BLOWING TRIUMPHAL MARCHES SEATED ON THOSE PRANCING MUSIC STOOLS THEIR CREAM COLOURED CHARGERS WHO ARE BY NO MEANS LOVELY AND ENTICING OBJECTS
310-129055-0037 A STOUT COUNTESS OF SIXTY DECOLLETEE PAINTED WRINKLED WITH ROUGE UP TO HER DROOPING EYELIDS AND DIAMONDS TWINKLING IN HER WIG IS A WHOLESOME AND EDIFYING BUT NOT A PLEASANT SIGHT
310-129055-0038 AS IT MAY BE SEEN OF AN EARLY MORNING WHEN HALF THE LAMPS ARE OUT AND THE OTHERS ARE BLINKING WANLY AS IF THEY WERE ABOUT TO VANISH LIKE GHOSTS BEFORE THE DAWN SUCH CHARMS
310-129055-0039 PASSES SHOULD APPEAR ABROAD AT NIGHT ALONE IF EVEN CYNTHIA LOOKS HAGGARD OF AN AFTERNOON AS WE MAY SEE HER SOMETIMES IN THE PRESENT WINTER SEASON
310-129055-0040 OF COUNTENANCE FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEAVENS HOW MUCH MORE CAN OLD LADY CASTLEMOULDY
310-129055-0041 WITH WHICH TIME HAS MARKED HER FACE NO DRAWING ROOMS SHOULD BE ANNOUNCED FOR NOVEMBER
310-129055-0042 SHOULD DRIVE UP IN CLOSED LITTERS
310-129055-0043 AND MAKE THEIR CURTSEY TO THE SOVEREIGN UNDER THE PROTECTION OF LAMPLIGHT OUR BELOVED REBECCA HAD NO NEED HOWEVER OF ANY SUCH A FRIENDLY HALO TO SET OFF HER BEAUTY
310-129055-0044 HER COMPLEXION COULD BEAR ANY SUNSHINE AS YET AND HER DRESS THOUGH IF YOU WERE TO SEE IT NOW ANY PRESENT LADY OF VANITY FAIR WOULD PRONOUNCE IT TO BE THE MOST FOOLISH AND PREPOSTEROUS ATTIRE EVER WORN WAS AS HANDSOME IN HER EYES AND THOSE OF THE PUBLIC
310-129055-0045 SOME FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS SINCE AS THE MOST BRILLIANT COSTUME OF THE MOST FAMOUS BEAUTY OF THE PRESENT SEASON A SCORE OF YEARS HENCE THAT TOO THAT MILLINER'S WONDER WILL HAVE PASSED INTO THE DOMAIN OF THE ABSURD
310-129055-0046 ALONG WITH ALL PREVIOUS VANITIES BUT WE ARE WANDERING TOO MUCH MISSUS RAWDON'S DRESS WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE CHARMANTE ON THE EVENTFUL DAY OF HER PRESENTATION
310-129055-0047 AS SHE LOOKED AT HER KINSWOMAN AND OWNED SORROWFULLY TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS QUITE INFERIOR IN TASTE TO MISSUS BECKY
310-129055-0048 THE BROCADE WAS AN OLD REMNANT BECKY SAID AND AS FOR THE LACE IT WAS A GREAT BARGAIN SHE HAD HAD IT THESE HUNDRED YEARS MY DEAR MISSUS CRAWLEY
310-129055-0049 WHICH WAS NOT NEARLY SO GOOD AND THEN EXAMINING THE QUALITY OF THE ANCIENT BROCADE WHICH FORMED THE MATERIAL OF MISSUS RAWDON'S COURT DRESS SHE FELT INCLINED TO SAY THAT SHE COULD NOT AFFORD SUCH FINE CLOTHING BUT CHECKED THAT SPEECH WITH AN EFFORT
310-129055-0050 AS ONE UNCHARITABLE TO HER KINSWOMAN AND YET IF LADY JANE HAD KNOWN ALL I THINK EVEN HER KINDLY TEMPER WOULD HAVE FAILED HER THE FACT IS WHEN SHE WAS PUTTING SIR PITT'S HOUSE IN ORDER
310-129055-0051 MISSUS RAWDON HAD FOUND THE LACE AND THE BROCADE IN OLD WARDROBES THE PROPERTY OF THE FORMER LADIES OF THE HOUSE AND HAD QUIETLY CARRIED THE GOODS HOME
310-129055-0052 TO HER OWN LITTLE PERSON BRIGGS SAW HER TAKE THEM ASKED NO QUESTIONS TOLD NO STORIES BUT I BELIEVE QUITE SYMPATHISED WITH HER ON THIS MATTER AND SO WOULD MANY ANOTHER HONEST WOMAN AND THE DIAMONDS
310-129055-0053 WHERE THE DOOSE DID YOU GET THE DIAMONDS BECKY SAID HER HUSBAND ADMIRING SOME JEWELS
310-129055-0054 WITH BRILLIANCE AND PROFUSION BECKY BLUSHED A LITTLE AND LOOKED AT HIM HARD FOR A MOMENT PITT CRAWLEY BLUSHED A LITTLE TOO AND LOOKED OUT OF WINDOW THE FACT IS HE HAD GIVEN HER A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE BRILLIANTS A PRETTY DIAMOND CLASP
310-129055-0055 WHICH CONFINED A PEARL NECKLACE WHICH SHE WORE AND THE BARONET HAD OMITTED TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO HIS LADY BECKY LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND AND THEN AT SIR PITT WITH AN AIR OF SAUCY TRIUMPH AS MUCH AS TO SAY SHALL I BETRAY YOU
310-129055-0056 WHY YOU SILLY MAN SHE CONTINUED WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE I GOT THEM ALL EXCEPT THE LITTLE CLASP WHICH A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE GAVE ME LONG AGO I HIRED THEM TO BE SURE I HIRED THEM AT MISTER POLONIUS'S IN COVENTRY STREET
310-129055-0057 YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT ALL THE DIAMONDS WHICH GO TO COURT BELONG TO THE WEARERS LIKE THOSE BEAUTIFUL STONES WHICH LADY JANE HAS AND WHICH ARE MUCH HANDSOMER THAN ANY WHICH I HAVE I AM CERTAIN
310-129055-0058 THE CARRIAGE ROLLED DOWN THE STREET UNTIL ITS CARGO WAS FINALLY DISCHARGED AT THE GATES OF THE PALACE WHERE THE SOVEREIGN WAS SITTING IN STATE THE DIAMONDS WHICH HAD CREATED RAWDON'S ADMIRATION
310-129055-0059 NEVER WENT BACK TO MISTER POLONIUS OF COVENTRY STREET AND THAT GENTLEMAN NEVER APPLIED FOR THEIR RESTORATION BUT THEY RETIRED INTO A LITTLE PRIVATE REPOSITORY IN AN OLD DESK WHICH AMELIA SEDLEY HAD GIVEN HER YEARS AND YEARS AGO
310-129055-0060 AND IN WHICH BECKY KEPT A NUMBER OF USEFUL AND PERHAPS VALUABLE THINGS
310-129055-0061 TO KNOW NOTHING OR LITTLE IS IN THE NATURE OF SOME HUSBANDS TO HIDE IN THE NATURE OF HOW MANY WOMEN OH LADIES HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE SURREPTITIOUS MILLINERS BILLS HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE GOWNS AND BRACELETS WHICH YOU DAREN'T SHOW OR WHICH YOU WEAR TREMBLING
310-129055-0062 TREMBLING AND COAXING WITH SMILES THE HUSBAND BY YOUR SIDE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE NEW VELVET GOWN FROM THE OLD ONE OR THE NEW BRACELET FROM LAST YEAR'S OR HAS ANY NOTION THAT THE RAGGED LOOKING YELLOW LACE SCARF COST FORTY GUINEAS
310-129055-0063 AND THAT MADAME BOBINOT IS WRITING DUNNING LETTERS EVERY WEEK FOR THE MONEY THUS RAWDON KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BRILLIANT DIAMOND EAR RINGS OR THE SUPERB BRILLIANT ORNAMENT WHICH DECORATED THE FAIR BOSOM OF HIS LADY BUT LORD STEYNE WHO WAS IN HIS PLACE AT COURT
310-129055-0064 AS LORD OF THE POWDER CLOSET AND ONE OF THE GREAT DIGNITARIES AND ILLUSTRIOUS DEFENCES OF THE THRONE OF ENGLAND AND CAME UP WITH ALL HIS STARS GARTERS COLLARS AND CORDONS AND PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE LITTLE WOMAN
310-129055-0065 KNEW WHENCE THE JEWELS CAME AND WHO PAID FOR THEM AS HE BOWED OVER HER HE SMILED
310-129055-0066 BUT I HOPE YOUR LORDSHIP IS ORTHODOX SAID THE LITTLE LADY WITH A TOSS OF HER HEAD AND MANY LADIES ROUND ABOUT WHISPERED AND TALKED AND MANY GENTLEMEN NODDED AND WHISPERED AS THEY SAW WHAT MARKED ATTENTION THE GREAT NOBLEMAN WAS PAYING TO THE LITTLE ADVENTURESS
310-129055-0067 WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN REBECCA CRAWLEY
310-129055-0068 IT DOES NOT BECOME SUCH A FEEBLE AND INEXPERIENCED PEN AS MINE TO ATTEMPT TO RELATE THE DAZZLED EYES CLOSE BEFORE THAT MAGNIFICENT IDEA LOYAL RESPECT AND DECENCY TELL EVEN THE IMAGINATION NOT TO LOOK TOO KEENLY
310-129055-0069 AND AUDACIOUSLY ABOUT THE SACRED AUDIENCE CHAMBER BUT TO BACK AWAY RAPIDLY SILENTLY AND RESPECTFULLY MAKING PROFOUND BOWS OUT OF THE AUGUST PRESENCE THIS MAY BE SAID
310-129055-0070 THAT IN ALL LONDON THERE WAS NO MORE LOYAL HEART THAN BECKY'S AFTER THIS INTERVIEW THE NAME OF HER KING WAS ALWAYS ON HER LIPS AND HE WAS PROCLAIMED BY HER TO BE THE MOST CHARMING OF MEN SHE WENT TO COLNAGHI'S
310-129055-0071 AND ORDERED THE FINEST PORTRAIT OF HIM THAT ART HAD PRODUCED AND CREDIT COULD SUPPLY SHE CHOSE THAT FAMOUS ONE IN WHICH THE BEST OF MONARCHS IS REPRESENTED IN A FROCK COAT
310-129055-0072 AND BREECHES AND SILK STOCKINGS SIMPERING ON A SOFA FROM UNDER HIS CURLY BROWN WIG SHE HAD HIM PAINTED IN A BROOCH AND WORE IT
310-129055-0073 SHE AMUSED AND SOMEWHAT PESTERED HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER PERPETUAL TALK ABOUT HIS URBANITY AND BEAUTY WHO KNOWS PERHAPS THE LITTLE WOMAN THOUGHT SHE MIGHT PLAY THE PART OF A MAINTENON OR A POMPADOUR
310-129055-0074 BUT THE FINEST SPORT OF ALL AFTER HER PRESENTATION WAS TO HEAR HER TALK VIRTUOUSLY
310-129055-0075 NOT IT MUST BE OWNED OF THE VERY HIGHEST REPUTATION IN VANITY FAIR
310-129055-0076 BECKY WOULD NOT CONSORT ANY LONGER WITH THESE DUBIOUS ONES AND CUT LADY CRACKENBURY WHEN THE LATTER NODDED TO HER FROM HER OPERA BOX AND GAVE MISSUS WASHINGTON WHITE THE GO BY IN THE RING ONE MUST MY DEAR SHOW ONE IS SOMEBODY SHE SAID
310-129055-0077 YOU MAY GO AND DINE WITH THEM AS YOU LIKE YOUR RUBBER BUT I MUSTN'T AND WON'T
310-129055-0078 THE PARTICULARS OF BECKY'S COSTUME WERE IN THE NEWSPAPERS FEATHERS LAPPETS SUPERB DIAMONDS AND ALL THE REST LADY CRACKENBURY READ THE PARAGRAPH IN BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT AND DISCOURSED TO HER FOLLOWERS
310-129055-0079 ABOUT THE AIRS WHICH THAT WOMAN WAS GIVING HERSELF MISSUS BUTE CRAWLEY AND HER YOUNG LADIES IN THE COUNTRY HAD A COPY OF THE MORNING POST FROM TOWN
310-129055-0080 IF YOU HAD BEEN SANDY HAIRED GREEN EYED AND A FRENCH ROPE DANCER'S DAUGHTER MISSUS BUTE SAID TO HER ELDEST GIRL WHO ON THE CONTRARY WAS A VERY SWARTHY SHORT AND SNUB NOSED YOUNG LADY
310-129055-0081 YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SUPERB DIAMONDS FORSOOTH AND HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AT COURT BY YOUR COUSIN THE LADY JANE
310-129055-0082 YOU HAVE ONLY SOME OF THE BEST BLOOD IN ENGLAND IN YOUR VEINS AND GOOD PRINCIPLES AND PIETY FOR YOUR PORTION I MYSELF THE WIFE OF A BARONET'S YOUNGER BROTHER TOO NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AS GOING TO COURT NOR WOULD OTHER PEOPLE
310-129055-0083 IF GOOD QUEEN CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN ALIVE IN THIS WAY THE WORTHY RECTORESS CONSOLED HERSELF AND HER DAUGHTERS SIGHED AND SAT OVER THE PEERAGE ALL NIGHT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FAMOUS PRESENTATION
310-129055-0084 ANOTHER GREAT AND EXCEEDING HONOUR WAS VOUCHSAFED TO THE VIRTUOUS BECKY LADY STEYNE'S CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO MISTER RAWDON CRAWLEY'S DOOR AND THE FOOTMAN INSTEAD OF DRIVING DOWN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS BY HIS TREMENDOUS KNOCKING HE APPEARED TO BE INCLINED TO DO
310-129055-0085 RELENTED AND ONLY DELIVERED IN A COUPLE OF CARDS ON WHICH WERE ENGRAVEN THE NAMES OF THE MARCHIONESS OF STEYNE AND THE COUNTESS OF GAUNT IF THESE BITS OF PASTEBOARD
310-129055-0086 A HUNDRED YARDS OF MALINES LACE ROLLED ROUND THEM WORTH TWICE THE NUMBER OF GUINEAS BECKY COULD NOT HAVE REGARDED THEM WITH MORE PLEASURE YOU MAY BE SURE THEY OCCUPIED A CONSPICUOUS PLACE IN THE CHINA BOWL
310-129055-0087 ON THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE WHERE BECKY KEPT THE CARDS OF HER VISITORS
310-129055-0088 HOW POOR MISSUS WASHINGTON WHITE'S CARD AND LADY CRACKENBURY'S CARD WHICH OUR LITTLE FRIEND HAD BEEN GLAD ENOUGH TO GET A FEW MONTHS BACK AND OF WHICH THE SILLY LITTLE CREATURE WAS RATHER PROUD ONCE LORD LORD I SAY
310-129055-0089 HOW SOON AT THE APPEARANCE OF THESE GRAND COURT CARDS DID THOSE POOR LITTLE NEGLECTED DEUCES SINK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK STEYNE BAREACRES JOHNES OF HELVELLYN AND CAERYLON OF CAMELOT
310-129055-0090 WE MAY BE SURE THAT BECKY AND BRIGGS LOOKED OUT THOSE AUGUST NAMES IN THE PEERAGE AND FOLLOWED THE NOBLE RACES UP THROUGH ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE FAMILY TREE MY LORD STEYNE
310-129055-0091 COMING TO CALL A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTERWARDS AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM AND OBSERVING EVERYTHING AS WAS HIS WONT FOUND HIS LADIES CARDS ALREADY RANGED AS THE TRUMPS OF BECKY'S HAND AND GRINNED
310-129055-0092 AS THIS OLD CYNIC ALWAYS DID AT ANY NAIVE DISPLAY OF HUMAN WEAKNESS BECKY CAME DOWN TO HIM PRESENTLY
310-129055-0093 AND OTHER FEMALE GIMCRACKS ARRANGED AND SHE SEATED IN SOME ARTLESS AND AGREEABLE POSTURE READY TO RECEIVE HIM WHENEVER SHE WAS SURPRISED OF COURSE
310-129055-0094 AND TO TRIP DOWN AGAIN TO WAIT UPON THE GREAT PEER SHE FOUND HIM GRINNING OVER THE BOWL SHE WAS DISCOVERED AND SHE BLUSHED A LITTLE THANK YOU MONSEIGNEUR SHE SAID
310-129055-0095 I COULDN'T COME BEFORE I WAS IN THE KITCHEN MAKING A PUDDING I KNOW YOU WERE I SAW YOU THROUGH THE AREA RAILINGS AS I DROVE UP REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
310-129055-0096 HE SAID GOOD NATUREDLY YOU SILLY LITTLE FIBSTER I HEARD YOU IN THE ROOM OVERHEAD WHERE I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU WERE PUTTING A LITTLE ROUGE ON YOU MUST GIVE SOME OF YOURS TO MY LADY GAUNT WHOSE COMPLEXION IS QUITE PREPOSTEROUS
310-129055-0097 AND I HEARD THE BEDROOM DOOR OPEN AND THEN YOU CAME DOWNSTAIRS
310-129055-0098 ANSWERED MISSUS RAWDON PLAINTIVELY AND SHE RUBBED HER CHEEK WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AS IF TO SHOW THERE WAS NO ROUGE AT ALL ONLY GENUINE BLUSHES AND MODESTY IN HER CASE ABOUT THIS WHO CAN TELL
310-129055-0099 I KNOW THERE IS SOME ROUGE THAT WON'T COME OFF ON A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF AND SOME SO GOOD THAT EVEN TEARS WILL NOT DISTURB IT WELL SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN TWIDDLING ROUND HIS WIFE'S CARD YOU ARE BENT ON BECOMING A FINE LADY
310-129055-0100 YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR OWN THERE YOU SILLY LITTLE FOOL YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY YOU WILL GET US A PLACE INTERPOSED BECKY AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY AND YOU WANT TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE
310-129055-0101 YOU POOR LITTLE EARTHENWARE PIPKIN YOU WANT TO SWIM DOWN THE STREAM ALONG WITH THE GREAT COPPER KETTLES
310-129055-0102 AND WE HAD NECK OF MUTTON AND TURNIPS
310-129055-0103 YOU WILL GO TO GAUNT HOUSE YOU GIVE AN OLD FELLOW NO REST UNTIL YOU GET THERE IT'S NOT HALF SO NICE AS HERE YOU'LL BE BORED THERE I AM MY WIFE IS AS GAY AS LADY MACBETH AND MY DAUGHTERS AS CHEERFUL AS REGAN AND GONERIL
310-129055-0104 I DAREN'T SLEEP IN WHAT THEY CALL MY BEDROOM THE BED IS LIKE THE BALDAQUIN OF SAINT PETER'S AND THE PICTURES FRIGHTEN ME I HAVE A LITTLE BRASS BED IN A DRESSING ROOM AND A LITTLE HAIR MATTRESS LIKE AN ANCHORITE I AM AN ANCHORITE
310-129055-0105 YOU'LL BE ASKED TO DINNER NEXT WEEK AND GARE AUX FEMMES LOOK OUT AND HOLD YOUR OWN HOW THE WOMEN WILL BULLY YOU THIS WAS A VERY LONG SPEECH FOR A MAN OF FEW WORDS LIKE MY LORD STEYNE
310-129055-0106 NOR WAS IT THE FIRST WHICH HE UTTERED FOR BECKY'S BENEFIT ON THAT DAY BRIGGS LOOKED UP FROM THE WORK TABLE AT WHICH SHE WAS SEATED IN THE FARTHER ROOM AND GAVE A DEEP SIGH
310-129055-0107 IF YOU DON'T TURN OFF THAT ABOMINABLE SHEEP DOG SAID LORD STEYNE WITH A SAVAGE LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER AT HER
310-129055-0108 LAUGHING MISCHIEVOUSLY AND HAVING ENJOYED FOR SOME TIME THE DISCOMFITURE OF MY LORD WHO HATED POOR BRIGGS FOR INTERRUPTING
310-129055-0109 MISSUS RAWDON AT LENGTH HAD PITY UPON HER ADMIRER AND CALLING TO BRIGGS PRAISED THE FINENESS OF THE WEATHER TO HER AND BADE HER TO TAKE OUT THE CHILD FOR A WALK I CAN'T SEND HER AWAY BECKY SAID PRESENTLY
310-129055-0110 AFTER A PAUSE AND IN A VERY SAD VOICE HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS SHE SPOKE AND SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
310-129055-0111 WORSE THAN THAT SAID BECKY STILL CASTING DOWN HER EYES I HAVE RUINED HER RUINED HER
310-129055-0112 ASKED MEN DO THAT BECKY ANSWERED BITTERLY WOMEN ARE NOT SO BAD AS YOU
310-129055-0113 SHE GAVE US EVERYTHING SHE SHALL NEVER LEAVE ME UNTIL WE ARE RUINED UTTERLY OURSELVES
310-129055-0114 SAID THE PEER WITH AN OATH AND BECKY REFLECTING ON THE LARGENESS OF HIS MEANS MENTIONED NOT ONLY THE SUM WHICH SHE HAD BORROWED FROM MISS BRIGGS BUT ONE OF NEARLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT THIS CAUSED THE LORD STEYNE TO BREAK OUT IN ANOTHER BRIEF AND ENERGETIC EXPRESSION OF ANGER
310-129055-0115 AT WHICH REBECCA HELD DOWN HER HEAD THE MORE AND CRIED BITTERLY I COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS MY ONLY CHANCE I DARE NOT TELL MY HUSBAND HE WOULD KILL ME IF I TOLD HIM WHAT I HAVE DONE I HAVE KEPT IT A SECRET FROM EVERYBODY BUT YOU AND YOU FORCED IT FROM ME
310-129055-0116 AH WHAT SHALL I DO LORD STEYNE FOR I AM VERY VERY UNHAPPY LORD STEYNE MADE NO REPLY EXCEPT BY BEATING THE DEVIL'S TATTOO AND BITING HIS NAILS AT LAST HE CLAPPED HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD AND FLUNG OUT OF THE ROOM
310-129055-0117 THEN SHE ROSE UP WITH THE QUEEREST EXPRESSION OF VICTORIOUS MISCHIEF GLITTERING IN HER GREEN EYES
310-129055-0118 AS SHE SAT AT WORK AND SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO SHE RATTLED AWAY A TRIUMPHANT VOLUNTARY ON THE KEYS WHICH MADE THE PEOPLE PAUSE UNDER HER WINDOW TO LISTEN TO HER BRILLIANT MUSIC THAT NIGHT
310-129055-0119 THERE CAME TWO NOTES FROM GAUNT HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE WOMAN THE ONE CONTAINING A CARD OF INVITATION FROM LORD AND LADY STEYNE TO A DINNER AT GAUNT HOUSE NEXT FRIDAY WHILE THE OTHER ENCLOSED A SLIP OF GRAY PAPER BEARING LORD STEYNE'S SIGNATURE AND THE ADDRESS OF MESSRS JONES
310-129055-0120 LOMBARD STREET RAWDON HEARD BECKY LAUGHING IN THE NIGHT ONCE OR TWICE IT WAS ONLY HER DELIGHT AT GOING TO GAUNT HOUSE AND FACING THE LADIES THERE SHE SAID WHICH AMUSED HER SO BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT SHE WAS OCCUPIED WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER THOUGHTS
310-129055-0121 SHOULD SHE PAY OFF OLD BRIGGS AND GIVE HER HER CONGE SHOULD SHE ASTONISH RAGGLES BY SETTLING HIS ACCOUNT SHE TURNED OVER ALL THESE THOUGHTS ON HER PILLOW
310-129055-0122 IN A MODEST DRESS WITH A VEIL ON WHIPPED OFF IN A HACKNEY COACH TO THE CITY AND BEING LANDED AT MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S BANK
310-129055-0123 SHE GENTLY SAID SHE WOULD TAKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS IN SMALL NOTES AND THE REMAINDER IN ONE NOTE AND PASSING THROUGH SAINT PAUL'S CHURCHYARD STOPPED THERE AND BOUGHT THE HANDSOMEST BLACK SILK GOWN FOR BRIGGS WHICH MONEY COULD BUY AND WHICH
310-129055-0124 THEN SHE WALKED TO MISTER RAGGLES INQUIRED ABOUT HIS CHILDREN AFFECTIONATELY AND GAVE HIM FIFTY POUNDS ON ACCOUNT THEN SHE WENT TO THE LIVERY MAN FROM WHOM SHE JOBBED HER CARRIAGES AND GRATIFIED HIM WITH A SIMILAR SUM
310-129055-0125 AND I HOPE THIS WILL BE A LESSON TO YOU SPAVIN SHE SAID AND THAT ON THE NEXT DRAWING ROOM DAY MY BROTHER SIR PITT
310-129055-0126 TO WAIT UPON HIS MAJESTY BECAUSE MY OWN CARRIAGE IS NOT FORTHCOMING IT APPEARS THERE HAD BEEN A DIFFERENCE ON THE LAST DRAWING ROOM DAY HENCE THE DEGRADATION WHICH THE COLONEL HAD ALMOST SUFFERED OF BEING OBLIGED TO ENTER THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOVEREIGN IN A HACK CAB
310-129055-0127 THESE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED BECKY PAID A VISIT UPSTAIRS TO THE BEFORE MENTIONED DESK WHICH AMELIA SEDLEY HAD GIVEN HER YEARS AND YEARS AGO AND WHICH CONTAINED A NUMBER OF USEFUL AND VALUABLE LITTLE THINGS IN WHICH PRIVATE MUSEUM SHE PLACED THE ONE NOTE WHICH
310-129055-0128 MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S
