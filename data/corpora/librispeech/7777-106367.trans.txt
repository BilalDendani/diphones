7777-106367-0000 LIKE MEN LYING IN WAIT FOR A WILD BEAST WITHIN BUT THERE HERACLES HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND WITH THE YOUNGER HEROES AND HE QUICKLY BENT HIS BACK SPRINGING BOW AGAINST THE MONSTERS AND BROUGHT THEM TO EARTH ONE AFTER ANOTHER
7777-106367-0001 AND THEY IN THEIR TURN RAISED HUGE RAGGED ROCKS AND HURLED THEM FOR THESE DREAD MONSTERS TOO I WEEN THE GODDESS HERA BRIDE OF ZEUS
7777-106367-0002 AND THEREWITHAL CAME THE REST OF THE MARTIAL HEROES RETURNING TO MEET THE FOE BEFORE THEY REACHED THE HEIGHT OF OUTLOOK AND THEY FELL TO THE SLAUGHTER OF THE EARTHBORN RECEIVING THEM WITH ARROWS AND SPEARS UNTIL THEY SLEW THEM ALL AS THEY RUSHED FIERCELY TO BATTLE
7777-106367-0003 AND AS WHEN WOODCUTTERS CAST IN ROWS UPON THE BEACH LONG TREES JUST HEWN DOWN BY THEIR AXES IN ORDER THAT ONCE SODDEN WITH BRINE THEY MAY RECEIVE THE STRONG BOLTS
7777-106367-0004 SO THESE MONSTERS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE FOAM FRINGED HARBOUR LAY STRETCHED ONE AFTER ANOTHER SOME IN HEAPS BENDING THEIR HEADS AND BREASTS INTO THE SALT WAVES
7777-106367-0005 AND THEY STEPPED ASHORE THAT SAME NIGHT AND THE ROCK IS STILL CALLED THE SACRED ROCK ROUND WHICH THEY THREW THE SHIP'S HAWSERS IN THEIR HASTE NOR DID ANYONE NOTE WITH CARE THAT IT WAS THE SAME ISLAND NOR IN THE NIGHT DID THE DOLIONES CLEARLY PERCEIVE THAT THE HEROES WERE RETURNING
7777-106367-0006 THEREFORE THEY DONNED THEIR ARMOUR AND RAISED THEIR HANDS AGAINST THEM AND WITH CLASHING OF ASHEN SPEARS AND SHIELDS THEY FELL ON EACH OTHER LIKE THE SWIFT RUSH OF FIRE WHICH FALLS ON DRY BRUSHWOOD AND REARS ITS CREST AND THE DIN OF BATTLE TERRIBLE AND FURIOUS
7777-106367-0007 FELL UPON THE PEOPLE OF THE DOLIONES NOR WAS THE KING TO ESCAPE HIS FATE AND RETURN HOME FROM BATTLE TO HIS BRIDAL CHAMBER AND BED BUT AESON'S SON LEAPT UPON HIM AS HE TURNED TO FACE HIM AND SMOTE HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BREAST
7777-106367-0008 FOR THAT NO MORTAL MAY ESCAPE BUT ON EVERY SIDE A WIDE SNARE ENCOMPASSES US AND SO WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ESCAPED BITTER DEATH FROM THE CHIEFS FATE ENTANGLED HIM THAT VERY NIGHT IN HER TOILS WHILE BATTLING WITH THEM
7777-106367-0009 AND MANY CHAMPIONS WITHAL WERE SLAIN HERACLES KILLED TELECLES AND MEGABRONTES
7777-106367-0010 TELAMON OF THE STRONG SPEAR SLEW BASILEUS AND IDAS SLEW PROMEUS AND CLYTIUS HYACINTHUS AND THE TWO SONS OF TYNDAREUS SLEW
7777-106367-0011 ALL OF WHOM THE INHABITANTS STILL HONOUR WITH THE WORSHIP DUE TO HEROES AND THE REST GAVE WAY AND FLED IN TERROR JUST AS DOVES FLY IN TERROR BEFORE SWIFT WINGED HAWKS AND WITH A DIN THEY RUSTLED IN A BODY TO THE GATES
7777-106367-0012 AND QUICKLY THE CITY WAS FILLED WITH LOUD CRIES AT THE TURNING OF THE DOLOROUS FIGHT BUT AT DAWN BOTH SIDES PERCEIVED THE FATAL AND CURELESS ERROR AND BITTER GRIEF SEIZED THE MINYAN HEROES
7777-106367-0013 WHEN THEY SAW BEFORE THEM CYZICUS SON OF AENEUS FALLEN IN THE MIDST OF DUST AND BLOOD
7777-106367-0014 THEN THREE TIMES ROUND HIS TOMB THEY PACED IN ARMOUR OF BRONZE AND PERFORMED FUNERAL RITES AND CELEBRATED GAMES AS WAS MEET UPON THE MEADOW PLAIN WHERE EVEN NOW RISES THE MOUND OF HIS GRAVE TO BE SEEN BY MEN OF A LATER DAY
7777-106367-0015 BUT TO CROWN THE ILL SHE WROUGHT AN ILL YET MORE AWFUL WHEN SHE CLASPED A NOOSE ROUND HER NECK HER DEATH EVEN THE NYMPHS OF THE GROVE BEWAILED AND OF ALL THE TEARS FOR HER THAT THEY SHED TO EARTH FROM THEIR EYES THE GODDESSES MADE A FOUNTAIN
7777-106367-0016 MOST TERRIBLE CAME THAT DAY FROM ZEUS UPON THE DOLIONES WOMEN AND MEN FOR NO ONE OF THEM DARED EVEN TO TASTE FOOD NOR FOR A LONG TIME BY REASON OF GRIEF DID THEY TAKE THOUGHT FOR THE TOIL OF THE CORNMILL
7777-106367-0017 PROPHESYING WITH SHRILL VOICE THE CEASING OF THE STORMY WINDS AND MOPSUS HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD THE CRY OF THE BIRD OF THE SHORE FRAUGHT WITH GOOD OMEN AND SOME GOD MADE IT TURN ASIDE
7777-106367-0018 AND THEY LOOSED THE HAWSERS FROM THE SACRED ROCK AND ROWED TO THE THRACIAN HARBOUR AND THE HEROES CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN LEAVING A FEW OF THEIR COMRADES IN THE SHIP AND TO THEM THE MACRIAN HEIGHTS AND ALL THE COAST OF THRACE OPPOSITE APPEARED TO VIEW CLOSE AT HAND
7777-106367-0019 AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE STREAM OF THE RIVER AESEPUS AND THE CITY AND NEPEIAN PLAIN OF ADRASTEIA NOW THERE WAS A STURDY STUMP OF VINE THAT GREW IN THE FOREST
7777-106367-0020 THIS THEY CUT DOWN TO BE THE SACRED IMAGE OF THE MOUNTAIN GODDESS AND ARGUS SMOOTHED IT SKILFULLY AND THEY SET IT UPON THAT RUGGED HILL BENEATH A CANOPY OF LOFTY OAKS WHICH OF ALL TREES HAVE THEIR ROOTS DEEPEST
7777-106367-0021 AND NEAR IT THEY HEAPED AN ALTAR OF SMALL STONES AND WREATHED THEIR BROWS WITH OAK LEAVES AND PAID HEED TO SACRIFICE INVOKING THE MOTHER OF DINDYMUM MOST VENERABLE DWELLER IN PHRYGIA
7777-106367-0022 WHOM ONCE THE NYMPH ANCHIALE AS SHE GRASPED WITH BOTH HANDS THE LAND OF OAXUS BARE IN THE DICTAEAN CAVE
7777-106367-0023 AND AT THE SAME TIME BY COMMAND OF ORPHEUS THE YOUTHS TROD A MEASURE DANCING IN FULL ARMOUR AND CLASHED WITH THEIR SWORDS ON THEIR SHIELDS SO THAT THE ILL OMENED CRY MIGHT BE LOST IN THE AIR THE WAIL WHICH THE PEOPLE WERE STILL SENDING UP IN GRIEF FOR THEIR KING
7777-106367-0024 HENCE FROM THAT TIME FORWARD THE PHRYGIANS PROPITIATE RHEA WITH THE WHEEL AND THE DRUM AND THE GRACIOUS GODDESS I WEEN INCLINED HER HEART TO PIOUS SACRIFICES AND FAVOURABLE SIGNS APPEARED THE TREES SHED ABUNDANT FRUIT
7777-106367-0025 AND ROUND THEIR FEET THE EARTH OF ITS OWN ACCORD PUT FORTH FLOWERS FROM THE TENDER GRASS AND THE BEASTS OF THE WILD WOOD LEFT THEIR LAIRS AND THICKETS AND CAME UP FAWNING ON THEM WITH THEIR TAILS
7777-106367-0026 AND SHE CAUSED YET ANOTHER MARVEL FOR HITHERTO THERE WAS NO FLOW OF WATER ON DINDYMUM BUT THEN FOR THEM AN UNCEASING STREAM GUSHED FORTH FROM THE THIRSTY PEAK JUST AS IT WAS
7777-106367-0027 AND THEY TRUSTING IN THE CALM MIGHTILY DROVE THE SHIP FORWARD AND AS SHE SPED THROUGH THE SALT SEA NOT EVEN THE STORM FOOTED STEEDS OF POSEIDON WOULD HAVE OVERTAKEN HER NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE SEA WAS STIRRED BY VIOLENT BLASTS
7777-106367-0028 WHICH WERE JUST RISING FROM THE RIVERS ABOUT EVENING FORSPENT WITH TOIL THEY CEASED BUT HERACLES BY THE MIGHT OF HIS ARMS PULLED THE WEARY ROWERS ALONG ALL TOGETHER AND MADE THE STRONG KNIT TIMBERS OF THE SHIP TO QUIVER BUT WHEN
7777-106367-0029 THEN HERACLES AS HE PLOUGHED UP THE FURROWS OF THE ROUGHENED SURGE BROKE HIS OAR IN THE MIDDLE
7777-106367-0030 HOSPITABLY WELCOMED AND GAVE THEM IN THEIR NEED PROVISIONS AND SHEEP AND ABUNDANT WINE HEREUPON SOME BROUGHT DRIED WOOD OTHERS FROM THE MEADOWS LEAVES FOR BEDS WHICH THEY GATHERED IN ABUNDANCE FOR STREWING
7777-106367-0031 WANDERING ABOUT HE FOUND A PINE NOT BURDENED WITH MANY BRANCHES NOR TOO FULL OF LEAVES BUT LIKE TO THE SHAFT OF A TALL POPLAR SO GREAT WAS IT BOTH IN LENGTH AND THICKNESS TO LOOK AT AND QUICKLY HE LAID ON THE GROUND HIS ARROW HOLDING QUIVER TOGETHER WITH HIS BOW
7777-106367-0032 AND TOOK OFF HIS LION'S SKIN AND HE LOOSENED THE PINE FROM THE GROUND WITH HIS BRONZE TIPPED CLUB AND GRASPED THE TRUNK WITH BOTH HANDS AT THE BOTTOM RELYING ON HIS STRENGTH AND HE PRESSED IT AGAINST HIS BROAD SHOULDER WITH LEGS WIDE APART
7777-106367-0033 AND CLINGING CLOSE HE RAISED IT FROM THE GROUND DEEP ROOTED THOUGH IT WAS
7777-106367-0034 THAT HE MIGHT BE QUICK IN DRAWING WATER FOR THE EVENING MEAL AND ACTIVELY MAKE ALL THINGS READY IN DUE ORDER AGAINST HIS LORD'S RETURN
7777-106367-0035 GOODLY THEIODAMAS WHOM THE HERO PITILESSLY SLEW AMONG THE DRYOPIANS BECAUSE HE WITHSTOOD HIM ABOUT AN OX FOR THE PLOUGH THEIODAMAS WAS CLEAVING WITH HIS PLOUGH THE SOIL OF FALLOW LAND WHEN HE WAS SMITTEN WITH THE CURSE
7777-106367-0036 AND HERACLES BADE HIM GIVE UP THE PLOUGHING OX AGAINST HIS WILL FOR HE DESIRED TO FIND SOME PRETEXT FOR WAR AGAINST THE DRYOPIANS FOR THEIR BANE SINCE THEY DWELT THERE RECKLESS OF RIGHT BUT THESE TALES WOULD LEAD ME FAR ASTRAY FROM MY SONG
7777-106367-0037 AND QUICKLY HYLAS CAME TO THE SPRING
7777-106367-0038 AND THE DANCES OF THE NYMPHS WERE JUST NOW BEING HELD THERE
7777-106367-0039 ALL THEY WERE RANGED FAR OFF GUARDING THE WOODS BUT ONE A WATER NYMPH WAS JUST RISING FROM THE FAIR FLOWING SPRING
7777-106367-0040 AND THE BOY SHE PERCEIVED CLOSE AT HAND WITH THE ROSY FLUSH OF HIS BEAUTY AND SWEET GRACE FOR THE FULL MOON BEAMING FROM THE SKY SMOTE HIM AND CYPRIS MADE HER HEART FAINT AND IN HER CONFUSION SHE COULD SCARCELY GATHER HER SPIRIT BACK TO HER
7777-106367-0041 AND THE BRIMMING WATER RANG LOUD AS IT POURED AGAINST THE SOUNDING BRONZE STRAIGHTWAY SHE LAID HER LEFT ARM ABOVE
7777-106367-0042 URGE THEM TO GO ABOARD AND AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE WIND AND THEY EMBARKED EAGERLY FORTHWITH AND THEY DREW UP THE SHIP'S ANCHORS AND HAULED THE ROPES ASTERN AND THE SAILS WERE BELLIED OUT BY THE WIND
7777-106367-0043 AND FAR FROM THE COAST WERE THEY JOYFULLY BORNE PAST THE POSIDEIAN HEADLAND BUT AT THE HOUR WHEN GLADSOME DAWN SHINES FROM HEAVEN RISING FROM THE EAST AND THE PATHS STAND OUT CLEARLY AND THE DEWY PLAINS SHINE WITH A BRIGHT GLEAM
7777-106367-0044 THEN AT LENGTH THEY WERE AWARE THAT UNWITTINGLY THEY HAD ABANDONED THOSE MEN AND A FIERCE QUARREL FELL UPON THEM AND VIOLENT TUMULT FOR THAT THEY HAD SAILED AND LEFT BEHIND THE BRAVEST OF THEIR COMRADES AND AESON'S SON
7777-106367-0045 BEWILDERED BY THEIR HAPLESS PLIGHT SAID NEVER A WORD
7777-106367-0046 HAPLESS ONES ASSUREDLY A BITTER VENGEANCE CAME UPON THEM THEREAFTER AT THE HANDS OF HERACLES BECAUSE THEY STAYED THE SEARCH FOR HIM FOR WHEN THEY WERE RETURNING FROM THE GAMES OVER PELIAS DEAD HE SLEW THEM IN SEA GIRT TENOS AND HEAPED THE EARTH ROUND THEM
7777-106367-0047 AND PLACED TWO COLUMNS ABOVE ONE OF WHICH A GREAT MARVEL FOR MEN TO SEE MOVES AT THE BREATH OF THE BLUSTERING NORTH WIND THESE THINGS WERE THUS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN AFTER TIMES BUT TO THEM APPEARED GLAUCUS FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA
7777-106367-0048 WAS DESTINED TO FOUND AND BUILD A CITY AMONG THE MYSIANS BEARING THE RIVER'S NAME AND THE OTHER HERACLES TO RETURN AND TOIL AT THE LABOURS OF EURYSTHEUS
7777-106367-0049 AND HE THREATENED TO LAY WASTE THE MYSIAN LAND AT ONCE SHOULD THEY NOT DISCOVER FOR HIM THE DOOM OF HYLAS WHETHER LIVING OR DEAD AND FOR HIM THEY GAVE PLEDGES CHOOSING OUT THE NOBLEST SONS OF THE PEOPLE
7777-106367-0050 THEREFORE TO THIS DAY THE PEOPLE OF CIUS ENQUIRE FOR HYLAS THE SON OF THEIODAMAS
