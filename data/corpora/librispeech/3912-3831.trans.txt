3912-3831-0000 VISITING DAY THE MEN'S WARD NEKHLUDOFF LEFT HOME EARLY A PEASANT FROM THE COUNTRY WAS STILL DRIVING ALONG THE SIDE STREET AND CALLING OUT IN A VOICE PECULIAR TO HIS TRADE
3912-3831-0001 THE BIRCH TREES IN THE GARDENS LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE STREWN WITH GREEN FLUFF
3912-3831-0002 AND RENOVATED TROUSERS AND WAISTCOATS WHICH HUNG OVER THEIR SHOULDERS MEN IN CLEAN COATS AND SHINING BOOTS LIBERATED FROM THE FACTORIES IT BEING SUNDAY
3912-3831-0003 AND WOMEN WITH BRIGHT SILK KERCHIEFS ON THEIR HEADS AND CLOTH JACKETS TRIMMED WITH JET WERE ALREADY THRONGING AT THE DOOR OF THE TRAKTIR POLICEMEN WITH YELLOW CORDS TO THEIR UNIFORMS AND CARRYING PISTOLS WERE ON DUTY
3912-3831-0004 ON THE PATHS OF THE BOULEVARDS AND ON THE NEWLY REVIVED GRASS CHILDREN AND DOGS RAN ABOUT PLAYING AND THE NURSES SAT MERRILY CHATTERING ON THE BENCHES ALONG THE STREETS STILL FRESH AND DAMP ON THE SHADY SIDE
3912-3831-0005 BUT DRY IN THE MIDDLE HEAVY CARTS RUMBLED UNCEASINGLY CABS RATTLED AND TRAMCARS PASSED RINGING BY
3912-3831-0006 AND THE PEOPLE DRESSED IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST WERE PASSING ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR DIFFERENT PARISH CHURCHES THE ISVOSTCHIK DID NOT DRIVE NEKHLUDOFF UP TO THE PRISON ITSELF BUT TO THE LAST TURNING THAT LED TO THE PRISON
3912-3831-0007 SEVERAL PERSONS MEN AND WOMEN MOST OF THEM CARRYING SMALL BUNDLES STOOD AT THIS TURNING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED STEPS FROM THE PRISON TO THE RIGHT THERE WERE SEVERAL LOW WOODEN BUILDINGS TO THE LEFT
3912-3831-0008 A TWO STOREYED HOUSE WITH A SIGNBOARD THE HUGE BRICK BUILDING THE PRISON PROPER WAS JUST IN FRONT AND THE VISITORS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO COME UP TO IT A SENTINEL WAS PACING UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF IT
3912-3831-0009 AND SHOUTED AT ANY ONE WHO TRIED TO PASS HIM AT THE GATE OF THE WOODEN BUILDINGS TO THE RIGHT OPPOSITE THE SENTINEL SAT A WARDER ON A BENCH DRESSED IN UNIFORM WITH GOLD CORDS A NOTEBOOK IN HIS HANDS
3912-3831-0010 THE VISITORS CAME UP TO HIM AND NAMED THE PERSONS THEY WANTED TO SEE AND HE PUT THE NAMES DOWN NEKHLUDOFF ALSO WENT UP AND NAMED KATERINA MASLOVA
3912-3831-0011 WHEN THE MASS IS OVER YOU'LL BE ADMITTED NEKHLUDOFF STEPPED ASIDE FROM THE WAITING CROWD A MAN IN TATTERED CLOTHES CRUMPLED HAT WITH BARE FEET AND RED STRIPES ALL OVER HIS FACE
3912-3831-0012 DETACHED HIMSELF FROM THE CROWD AND TURNED TOWARDS THE PRISON NOW THEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING SHOUTED THE SENTINEL WITH THE GUN
3912-3831-0013 NOT IN THE LEAST ABASHED BY THE SENTINEL'S WORDS AND TURNED BACK WELL IF YOU'LL NOT LET ME IN I'LL WAIT BUT NO MUST NEEDS SHOUT AS IF HE WERE A GENERAL THE CROWD LAUGHED APPROVINGLY
3912-3831-0014 THE VISITORS WERE FOR THE GREATER PART BADLY DRESSED PEOPLE SOME WERE RAGGED BUT THERE WERE ALSO SOME RESPECTABLE LOOKING MEN AND WOMEN
3912-3831-0015 NEXT TO NEKHLUDOFF STOOD A CLEAN SHAVEN STOUT AND RED CHEEKED MAN HOLDING A BUNDLE APPARENTLY CONTAINING UNDER GARMENTS THIS WAS THE DOORKEEPER OF A BANK HE HAD COME TO SEE HIS BROTHER
3912-3831-0016 WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR FORGERY THE GOOD NATURED FELLOW TOLD NEKHLUDOFF THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS LIFE AND WAS GOING TO QUESTION HIM IN TURN WHEN THEIR ATTENTION WAS AROUSED BY A STUDENT AND A VEILED LADY WHO DROVE UP IN A TRAP
3912-3831-0017 WITH RUBBER TYRES DRAWN BY A LARGE THOROUGHBRED HORSE THE STUDENT WAS HOLDING A LARGE BUNDLE HE CAME UP TO NEKHLUDOFF AND ASKED IF AND HOW HE COULD GIVE THE ROLLS HE HAD BROUGHT IN ALMS TO THE PRISONERS
3912-3831-0018 HIS FIANCEE WISHED IT THIS LADY WAS HIS FIANCEE AND HER PARENTS HAD ADVISED THEM TO TAKE SOME ROLLS TO THE PRISONERS I MYSELF AM HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAID NEKHLUDOFF AND DON'T KNOW
3912-3831-0019 BUT I THINK YOU HAD BETTER ASK THIS MAN AND HE POINTED TO THE WARDER WITH THE GOLD CORDS AND THE BOOK SITTING ON THE RIGHT AS THEY WERE SPEAKING THE LARGE IRON DOOR WITH A WINDOW IN IT OPENED AND AN OFFICER IN UNIFORM
3912-3831-0020 FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER WARDER STEPPED OUT THE WARDER WITH THE NOTEBOOK PROCLAIMED THAT THE ADMITTANCE OF VISITORS WOULD NOW COMMENCE THE SENTINEL STEPPED ASIDE
3912-3831-0021 SOME EVEN RAN AT THE DOOR THERE STOOD A WARDER WHO COUNTED THE VISITORS AS THEY CAME IN SAYING ALOUD SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SO ON
3912-3831-0022 ANOTHER WARDER STOOD INSIDE THE BUILDING AND ALSO COUNTED THE VISITORS AS THEY ENTERED A SECOND DOOR TOUCHING EACH ONE WITH HIS HAND SO THAT WHEN THEY WENT AWAY AGAIN NOT ONE VISITOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO REMAIN INSIDE THE PRISON
3912-3831-0023 AND NOT ONE PRISONER MIGHT GET OUT THE WARDER WITHOUT LOOKING AT WHOM HE WAS TOUCHING SLAPPED NEKHLUDOFF ON THE BACK AND NEKHLUDOFF FELT HURT BY THE TOUCH OF THE WARDER'S HAND BUT REMEMBERING WHAT HE HAD COME ABOUT
3912-3831-0024 HE FELT ASHAMED OF FEELING DISSATISFIED AND TAKING OFFENCE THE FIRST APARTMENT BEHIND THE ENTRANCE DOORS WAS A LARGE VAULTED ROOM WITH IRON BARS TO THE SMALL WINDOWS IN THIS ROOM WHICH WAS CALLED THE MEETING ROOM
3912-3831-0025 NEKHLUDOFF WAS STARTLED BY THE SIGHT OF A LARGE PICTURE OF THE CRUCIFIXION WHAT'S THAT FOR HE THOUGHT HIS MIND INVOLUNTARILY CONNECTING THE SUBJECT OF THE PICTURE WITH LIBERATION AND NOT WITH IMPRISONMENT HE WENT ON
3912-3831-0026 SLOWLY LETTING THE HURRYING VISITORS PASS BEFORE AND EXPERIENCING A MINGLED FEELING OF HORROR AT THE EVIL DOERS LOCKED UP IN THIS BUILDING COMPASSION FOR THOSE WHO LIKE KATUSHA AND THE BOY THEY TRIED THE DAY BEFORE MUST BE HERE THOUGH GUILTLESS
3912-3831-0027 AND SHYNESS AND TENDER EMOTION AT THE THOUGHT OF THE INTERVIEW BEFORE HIM THE WARDER AT THE OTHER END OF THE MEETING ROOM SAID SOMETHING AS THEY PASSED BUT NEKHLUDOFF ABSORBED BY HIS OWN THOUGHTS PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIM
3912-3831-0028 AND CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE MAJORITY OF THE VISITORS AND SO GOT INTO THE MEN'S PART OF THE PRISON INSTEAD OF THE WOMEN'S LETTING THE HURRYING VISITORS PASS BEFORE HIM HE WAS THE LAST TO GET INTO THE INTERVIEWING ROOM
3912-3831-0029 AS SOON AS NEKHLUDOFF OPENED THE DOOR OF THIS ROOM HE WAS STRUCK BY THE DEAFENING ROAR OF A HUNDRED VOICES SHOUTING AT ONCE THE REASON OF WHICH HE DID NOT AT ONCE UNDERSTAND BUT WHEN HE CAME NEARER TO THE PEOPLE
3912-3831-0030 HE SAW THAT THEY WERE ALL PRESSING AGAINST A NET THAT DIVIDED THE ROOM IN TWO LIKE FLIES SETTLING ON SUGAR AND HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT MEANT THE TWO HALVES OF THE ROOM THE WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE OPPOSITE THE DOOR HE HAD COME IN BY
3912-3831-0031 WERE SEPARATED NOT BY ONE BUT BY TWO NETS REACHING FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING THE WIRE NETS WERE STRETCHED SEVEN FEET APART AND SOLDIERS WERE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE SPACE BETWEEN THEM
3912-3831-0032 ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE NETS WERE THE PRISONERS ON THE NEARER THE VISITORS BETWEEN THEM WAS A DOUBLE ROW OF NETS AND A SPACE OF SEVEN FEET WIDE SO THAT THEY COULD NOT HAND ANYTHING TO ONE ANOTHER
3912-3831-0033 AND ANY ONE WHOSE SIGHT WAS NOT VERY GOOD COULD NOT EVEN DISTINGUISH THE FACE ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS ALSO DIFFICULT TO TALK ONE HAD TO SCREAM IN ORDER TO BE HEARD ON BOTH SIDES WERE FACES PRESSED CLOSE TO THE NETS
3912-3831-0034 FACES OF WIVES HUSBANDS FATHERS MOTHERS CHILDREN TRYING TO SEE EACH OTHER'S FEATURES AND TO SAY WHAT WAS NECESSARY IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BUT AS EACH ONE TRIED TO BE HEARD BY THE ONE HE WAS TALKING TO AND HIS NEIGHBOUR TRIED TO DO THE SAME
3912-3831-0035 THEY DID THEIR BEST TO DROWN EACH OTHER'S VOICES AND THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DIN AND SHOUTING WHICH STRUCK NEKHLUDOFF WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS BEING SAID AND WHAT WERE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
3912-3831-0036 AN OLD WOMAN WITH A KERCHIEF ON HER HEAD STOOD TREMBLING HER CHIN PRESSED CLOSE TO THE NET AND SHOUTING SOMETHING TO A YOUNG FELLOW HALF OF WHOSE HEAD WAS SHAVED WHO LISTENED ATTENTIVELY WITH RAISED BROWS
3912-3831-0037 BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD WOMAN WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A PEASANT'S COAT WHO LISTENED SHAKING HIS HEAD TO A BOY VERY LIKE HIMSELF
3912-3831-0038 NEXT TO HIM A WOMAN WITH A GOOD WOOLLEN SHAWL ON HER SHOULDERS SAT ON THE FLOOR HOLDING A BABY IN HER LAP AND CRYING BITTERLY THIS WAS APPARENTLY THE FIRST TIME SHE SAW THE GREYHEADED MAN ON THE OTHER SIDE IN PRISON CLOTHES
3912-3831-0039 AND WITH HIS HEAD SHAVED BEYOND HER WAS THE DOORKEEPER WHO HAD SPOKEN TO NEKHLUDOFF OUTSIDE HE WAS SHOUTING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO A GREYHAIRED CONVICT ON THE OTHER SIDE
3912-3831-0040 WHEN NEKHLUDOFF FOUND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO SPEAK IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS A FEELING OF INDIGNATION AGAINST THOSE WHO WERE ABLE TO MAKE AND ENFORCE THESE CONDITIONS AROSE IN HIM
3912-3831-0041 HE WAS SURPRISED THAT PLACED IN SUCH A DREADFUL POSITION NO ONE SEEMED OFFENDED AT THIS OUTRAGE ON HUMAN FEELINGS THE SOLDIERS THE INSPECTOR THE PRISONERS THEMSELVES ACTED AS IF ACKNOWLEDGING ALL THIS TO BE NECESSARY
3912-3831-0042 NEKHLUDOFF REMAINED IN THIS ROOM FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES FEELING STRANGELY DEPRESSED CONSCIOUS OF HOW POWERLESS HE WAS AND AT VARIANCE WITH ALL THE WORLD HE WAS SEIZED WITH A CURIOUS MORAL SENSATION
