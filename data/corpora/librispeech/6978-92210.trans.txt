6978-92210-0000 WHILE THE BARE SPOTS WERE PURPLE WITH THE WILD DAKOTA CROCUSES
6978-92210-0001 UPON THE LOWEST OF A SERIES OF NATURAL TERRACES THERE STOOD ON THIS MAY MORNING A YOUNG SIOUX GIRL WHOSE GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS WERE NOT UNLIKE THOSE OF A DOE WHICH CHANCED TO BE LURKING IN A NEIGHBORING GULCH ON THE UPPER PLAINS NOT FAR AWAY WERE HER YOUNG COMPANIONS ALL BUSILY EMPLOYED WITH THE WEWOPTAY AS IT IS CALLED
6978-92210-0002 THE SHARP POINTED STICK WITH WHICH THE SIOUX WOMEN DIG WILD TURNIPS THEY WERE GAYLY GOSSIPING TOGETHER OR EACH HUMMING A LOVE SONG AS SHE WORKED ONLY SNANA STOOD SOMEWHAT APART FROM THE REST IN FACT CONCEALED BY THE CREST OF THE RIDGE
6978-92210-0003 IT WAS NOW FULL BORN DAY THE SUN SHONE HOT UPON THE BARE GROUND AND THE DROPS STOOD UPON SNANA'S FOREHEAD AS SHE PLIED HER LONG POLE THERE WAS A COOL SPRING IN THE DRY CREEK BED NEAR BY
6978-92210-0004 WELL HIDDEN BY A CLUMP OF CHOKE CHERRY BUSHES AND SHE TURNED THITHER TO COOL HER THIRSTY THROAT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE RAVINE HER EYE CAUGHT A FAMILIAR FOOTPRINT THE TRACK OF A DOE WITH THE YOUNG FAWN BESIDE IT THE HUNTING INSTINCT AROSE WITHIN
6978-92210-0005 IT WILL BE A GREAT FEAT IF I CAN FIND AND TAKE FROM HER THE BABE THE LITTLE TAWNY SKIN SHALL BE BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED BY MY MOTHER
6978-92210-0006 AH A MOTHER'S RUSE SNANA ENTERED THE THORNY ENCLOSURE WHICH WAS ALMOST A RUDE TEEPEE AND TUCKED AWAY IN THE FURTHER MOST CORNER LAY SOMETHING WITH A TROUT LIKE SPECKLED TAWNY COAT SHE BENT OVER IT THE FAWN WAS APPARENTLY SLEEPING
6978-92210-0007 PRESENTLY ITS EYES MOVED A BIT AND A SHIVER PASSED THROUGH ITS SUBTLE BODY THOU SHALT NOT DIE THY SKIN SHALL NOT BECOME MY WORK BAG UNCONSCIOUSLY THE MAIDEN SPOKE
6978-92210-0008 THE MOTHER SYMPATHY HAD TAKEN HOLD ON HER MIND SHE PICKED THE FAWN UP TENDERLY BOUND ITS LEGS AND PUT IT ON HER BACK TO CARRY LIKE AN INDIAN BABE IN THE FOLDS OF HER ROBE
6978-92210-0009 AND THE MOTHER WAS NOT TOO FAR AWAY TO HEAR NOW SHE CALLED FRANTICALLY FOR HER CHILD AT THE SAME TIME STAMPING WITH HER DELICATE FOREFEET YES SISTER YOU ARE RIGHT SHE IS YOURS BUT YOU CANNOT SAVE HER TO DAY
6978-92210-0010 THE HUNTERS WILL SOON BE HERE LET ME KEEP HER FOR YOU I WILL RETURN HER TO YOU SAFELY AND HEAR ME O SISTER OF THE WOODS THAT SOME DAY I MAY BECOME THE MOTHER OF A NOBLE RACE OF WARRIORS AND OF FINE WOMEN AS HANDSOME AS YOU ARE
6978-92210-0011 AT THIS MOMENT THE QUICK EYES OF THE INDIAN GIRL DETECTED SOMETHING STRANGE IN THE DOE'S ACTIONS SHE GLANCED IN EVERY DIRECTION AND BEHOLD
6978-92210-0012 AND FLEW FOR THE NEAREST SCRUB OAK ON THE EDGE OF THE BANK UP THE TREE SHE SCRAMBLED WITH THE FAWN STILL SECURELY BOUND TO HER BACK THE GRIZZLY CAME ON WITH TEETH EXPOSED AND THE DOE MOTHER IN HER FLIGHT CAME BETWEEN HIM AND THE TREE
6978-92210-0013 GIVING A SERIES OF INDIGNANT SNORTS AS SHE RAN
6978-92210-0014 AND THEY IMMEDIATELY GAVE A GENERAL ALARM MATO SAW THEM BUT APPEARED NOT AT ALL CONCERNED AND WAS STILL INTENT UPON DISLODGING THE GIRL WHO CLUNG FRANTICALLY TO HER PERCH PRESENTLY THERE APPEARED UPON THE LITTLE KNOLL SEVERAL WARRIORS MOUNTED AND UTTERING THE USUAL WAR WHOOP
6978-92210-0015 AS IF THEY WERE ABOUT TO SWOOP DOWN UPON A HUMAN ENEMY THIS TOUCHED THE DIGNITY OF MATO AND HE IMMEDIATELY PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE EVERY INDIAN WAS ALIVE TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE OCCASION FOR IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MATO OR GRIZZLY BEAR ALONE AMONG ANIMALS
6978-92210-0016 IS GIVEN THE RANK OF A WARRIOR SO THAT WHOEVER CONQUERS HIM MAY WEAR AN EAGLE FEATHER WOO WOO THE WARRIORS SHOUTED AS THEY MANEUVERED TO DRAW HIM INTO THE OPEN PLAIN
6978-92210-0017 HE ANSWERED WITH HOARSE GROWLS THREATENING A RIDER WHO HAD VENTURED TOO NEAR BUT ARROWS WERE MANY AND WELL AIMED AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE GREAT AND WARLIKE MATO LAY DEAD AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE
6978-92210-0018 THE MEN RAN FORWARD AND COUNTED THEIR COUPS ON HIM JUST AS WHEN AN ENEMY IS FALLEN THEN THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND PLACED THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR MOUTHS AS THE YOUNG GIRL DESCENDED THE TREE WITH A FAWN BOUND UPON HER BACK
6978-92210-0019 SO THAT WAS THE BAIT THEY CRIED AND WILL YOU NOT MAKE A FEAST WITH THAT FAWN FOR US WHO CAME TO YOUR RESCUE THE FAWN IS YOUNG AND TENDER AND WE HAVE NOT EATEN MEAT FOR TWO DAYS IT WILL BE A GENEROUS THING TO DO ADDED HER FATHER WHO WAS AMONG THEM YE E E SHE CRIED OUT IN DISTRESS DO NOT ASK IT I HAVE SEEN THIS FAWN'S MOTHER I HAVE PROMISED TO KEEP HER CHILD SAFE SEE I HAVE SAVED ITS LIFE

6978-92210-0021 IT WAS NO SMALL TROUBLE FOR SNANA TO KEEP HER TRUST AS MAY WELL BE SUPPOSED ALL THE DOGS OF THE TEEPEE VILLAGE MUST BE WATCHED AND KEPT AT A DISTANCE NEITHER WAS IT EASY TO FEED THE LITTLE CAPTIVE
6978-92210-0022 THAT THE MOTHER WOULD RETURN SHE CROUCHED UNDER A CLUMP OF BUSHES NEAR BY AND GAVE THE DOE CALL IT WAS A RECKLESS THING FOR HER TO DO FOR SUCH A CALL MIGHT BRING UPON HER A MOUNTAIN LION OR EVER WATCHFUL SILVER TIP BUT SNANA DID NOT THINK OF THAT
6978-92210-0023 IN A FEW MINUTES SHE HEARD THE LIGHT PATTER OF HOOFS AND CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A DOE RUNNING STRAIGHT TOWARD THE FAWN'S HIDING PLACE WHEN SHE STOLE NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE DOE AND THE FAWN WERE EXAMINING ONE ANOTHER CAREFULLY AS IF FEARING SOME TREACHERY AT LAST BOTH WERE APPARENTLY SATISFIED
6978-92210-0024 THE DOE CARESSED HER NATURAL CHILD AND THE LITTLE ONE ACCEPTED THE MILK SHE OFFERED IN THE SIOUX MAIDEN'S MIND THERE WAS TURMOIL A CLOSE ATTACHMENT TO THE LITTLE WILD CREATURE HAD ALREADY TAKEN ROOT THERE CONTENDING WITH THE SENSE OF JUSTICE THAT WAS STRONG WITHIN HER
6978-92210-0025 NOW WOMANLY SYMPATHY FOR THE MOTHER WAS IN CONTROL AND NOW A DESIRE TO POSSESS AND PROTECT HER HELPLESS PET I CAN TAKE CARE OF HER AGAINST ALL HUNTERS BOTH ANIMAL AND HUMAN
6978-92210-0026 THEY ARE EVER READY TO SEIZE THE HELPLESS FAWN FOR FOOD HER LIFE WILL BE OFTEN EXPOSED YOU CANNOT SAVE HER FROM DISASTER O TAKCHA MY SISTER LET ME STILL KEEP HER FOR YOU SHE FINALLY APPEALED TO THE POOR DOE
6978-92210-0027 WHO WAS NERVOUSLY WATCHING THE INTRUDER AND APPARENTLY THINKING HOW SHE MIGHT BEST ESCAPE WITH THE FAWN JUST AT THIS MOMENT THERE CAME A LOW CALL FROM THE WOOD IT WAS A DOE CALL BUT THE WILD MOTHER AND HER NEW FRIEND BOTH KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT THE CALL OF A REAL DOE
6978-92210-0028 IT IS A SIOUX HUNTER WHISPERED THE GIRL YOU MUST GO MY SISTER BE OFF I WILL TAKE YOUR CHILD TO SAFETY WHILE SHE WAS YET SPEAKING THE DOE SEEMED TO REALIZE THE DANGER SHE STOPPED ONLY AN INSTANT TO LICK FONDLY THE TAWNY COAT OF THE LITTLE ONE
6978-92210-0029 THEN SHE BOUNDED AWAY AS SNANA EMERGED FROM THE BUSHES WITH HER CHARGE A YOUNG HUNTER MET HER FACE TO FACE AND STARED AT HER CURIOUSLY HE WAS NOT OF HER FATHER'S CAMP BUT A STRANGER UGH YOU HAVE MY GAME
6978-92210-0030 TOSH SHE REPLIED COQUETTISHLY IT WAS SO OFTEN SAID AMONG THE INDIANS THAT THE DOE WAS WONT TO PUT ON HUMAN FORM TO MISLEAD THE HUNTER THAT IT LOOKED STRANGE TO SEE A WOMAN WITH A FAWN AND THE YOUNG MAN COULD NOT FORBEAR TO GAZE UPON SNANA YOU ARE NOT THE REAL MOTHER IN MAIDEN'S GUISE TELL ME TRULY IF YOU ARE OF HUMAN BLOOD
6978-92210-0031 HE DEMANDED RUDELY I AM A SIOUX MAIDEN DO YOU NOT KNOW MY FATHER SHE REPLIED AH BUT WHO IS YOUR FATHER WHAT IS HIS NAME HE INSISTED NERVOUSLY FINGERING HIS ARROWS
