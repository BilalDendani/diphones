1913-147990-0000 IN LINCOLN THE BEST PART OF THE THEATRICAL SEASON CAME LATE WHEN THE GOOD COMPANIES STOPPED OFF THERE FOR ONE NIGHT STANDS AFTER THEIR LONG RUNS IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO THAT SPRING LENA WENT WITH ME TO SEE JOSEPH JEFFERSON IN RIP VAN WINKLE
1913-147990-0001 SHE HANDED HER FEELINGS OVER TO THE ACTORS WITH A KIND OF FATALISTIC RESIGNATION ACCESSORIES OF COSTUME AND SCENE MEANT MUCH MORE TO HER THAN TO ME SHE SAT ENTRANCED THROUGH ROBIN HOOD AND HUNG UPON THE LIPS OF THE CONTRALTO WHO SANG
1913-147990-0002 OH PROMISE ME TOWARD THE END OF APRIL THE BILLBOARDS WHICH I WATCHED ANXIOUSLY IN THOSE DAYS BLOOMED OUT ONE MORNING WITH GLEAMING WHITE POSTERS ON WHICH TWO NAMES WERE IMPRESSIVELY PRINTED IN BLUE GOTHIC LETTERS
1913-147990-0003 THE NAME OF AN ACTRESS OF WHOM I HAD OFTEN HEARD AND THE NAME CAMILLE I CALLED AT THE RALEIGH BLOCK FOR LENA ON SATURDAY EVENING AND WE WALKED DOWN TO THE THEATER THE WEATHER WAS WARM AND SULTRY AND PUT US BOTH IN A HOLIDAY HUMOR
1913-147990-0004 WE ARRIVED EARLY BECAUSE LENA LIKED TO WATCH THE PEOPLE COME IN THERE WAS A NOTE ON THE PROGRAMME SAYING THAT THE INCIDENTAL MUSIC WOULD BE FROM THE OPERA TRAVIATA WHICH WAS MADE FROM THE SAME STORY AS THE PLAY WE HAD NEITHER OF US READ THE PLAY AND WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
1913-147990-0005 THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO WHICH I HAD SEEN JAMES O'NEILL PLAY THAT WINTER WAS BY THE ONLY ALEXANDRE DUMAS I KNEW THIS PLAY I SAW WAS BY HIS SON AND I EXPECTED A FAMILY RESEMBLANCE
1913-147990-0006 A COUPLE OF JACK RABBITS RUN IN OFF THE PRAIRIE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE INNOCENT OF WHAT AWAITED THEM THAN WERE LENA AND I OUR EXCITEMENT BEGAN WITH THE RISE OF THE CURTAIN WHEN THE MOODY VARVILLE SEATED BEFORE THE FIRE INTERROGATED NANINE
1913-147990-0007 DECIDEDLY THERE WAS A NEW TANG ABOUT THIS DIALOGUE I HAD NEVER HEARD IN THE THEATER LINES THAT WERE ALIVE THAT PRESUPPOSED AND TOOK FOR GRANTED LIKE THOSE WHICH PASSED BETWEEN VARVILLE AND MARGUERITE IN THE BRIEF ENCOUNTER BEFORE HER FRIENDS ENTERED
1913-147990-0008 WAS DELICATE TORMENT I SEEM TO REMEMBER GILDED CHAIRS AND TABLES ARRANGED HURRIEDLY BY FOOTMEN IN WHITE GLOVES AND STOCKINGS LINEN OF DAZZLING WHITENESS GLITTERING GLASS SILVER DISHES A GREAT BOWL OF FRUIT AND THE REDDEST OF ROSES
1913-147990-0009 THE ROOM WAS INVADED BY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN AND DASHING YOUNG MEN LAUGHING AND TALKING TOGETHER THE MEN WERE DRESSED MORE OR LESS AFTER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE PLAY WAS WRITTEN THE WOMEN WERE NOT I SAW NO INCONSISTENCY
1913-147990-0010 EVERY SENTENCE MADE ONE OLDER AND WISER
1913-147990-0011 ONE COULD EXPERIENCE EXCESS AND SATIETY WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF LEARNING WHAT TO DO WITH ONE'S HANDS IN A DRAWING ROOM WHEN THE CHARACTERS ALL SPOKE AT ONCE AND I MISSED SOME OF THE PHRASES THEY FLASHED AT EACH OTHER I WAS IN MISERY
1913-147990-0012 SHE WAS ALREADY OLD WITH A RAVAGED COUNTENANCE AND A PHYSIQUE CURIOUSLY HARD AND STIFF SHE MOVED WITH DIFFICULTY I THINK SHE WAS LAME I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOME STORY ABOUT A MALADY OF THE SPINE
1913-147990-0013 HER ARMAND WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY YOUNG AND SLIGHT A HANDSOME YOUTH PERPLEXED IN THE EXTREME BUT WHAT DID IT MATTER I BELIEVED DEVOUTLY IN HER POWER TO FASCINATE HIM IN HER DAZZLING LOVELINESS I BELIEVED HER YOUNG
1913-147990-0014 ARDENT RECKLESS DISILLUSIONED UNDER SENTENCE FEVERISH AVID OF PLEASURE I WANTED TO CROSS THE FOOTLIGHTS AND HELP THE SLIM WAISTED ARMAND IN THE FRILLED SHIRT TO CONVINCE HER THAT THERE WAS STILL LOYALTY AND DEVOTION IN THE WORLD HER SUDDEN
1913-147990-0015 ILLNESS WHEN THE GAYETY WAS AT ITS HEIGHT HER PALLOR THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE CRUSHED AGAINST HER LIPS THE COUGH SHE SMOTHERED UNDER THE LAUGHTER WHILE GASTON KEPT PLAYING THE PIANO LIGHTLY IT ALL WRUNG MY HEART
1913-147990-0016 BUT NOT SO MUCH AS HER CYNICISM IN THE LONG DIALOGUE WITH HER LOVER WHICH FOLLOWED
1913-147990-0017 WHILE THE CHARMINGLY SINCERE YOUNG MAN PLEADED WITH HER ACCOMPANIED BY THE ORCHESTRA IN THE OLD TRAVIATA DUET MISTERIOSO MISTERIOSO SHE MAINTAINED HER BITTER SKEPTICISM AND THE CURTAIN FELL ON HER DANCING RECKLESSLY WITH THE OTHERS
1913-147990-0018 BETWEEN THE ACTS WE HAD NO TIME TO FORGET THE ORCHESTRA KEPT SAWING AWAY AT THE TRAVIATA MUSIC SO JOYOUS AND SAD SO THIN AND FAR AWAY SO CLAP TRAP AND YET SO HEART BREAKING
1913-147990-0019 AFTER THE SECOND ACT I LEFT LENA IN TEARFUL CONTEMPLATION OF THE CEILING AND WENT OUT INTO THE LOBBY TO SMOKE AS I WALKED ABOUT THERE I CONGRATULATED MYSELF THAT I HAD NOT BROUGHT SOME LINCOLN GIRL WHO WOULD TALK DURING THE WAITS ABOUT THE JUNIOR DANCES
1913-147990-0020 OR WHETHER THE CADETS WOULD CAMP AT PLATTSMOUTH LENA WAS AT LEAST A WOMAN AND I WAS A MAN
1913-147990-0021 LENA WEPT UNCEASINGLY AND I SAT HELPLESS TO PREVENT THE CLOSING OF THAT CHAPTER OF IDYLLIC LOVE DREADING THE RETURN OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE INEFFABLE HAPPINESS WAS ONLY TO BE THE MEASURE OF HIS FALL
1913-147990-0022 I SUPPOSE NO WOMAN COULD HAVE BEEN FURTHER IN PERSON VOICE AND TEMPERAMENT FROM DUMAS APPEALING HEROINE THAN THE VETERAN ACTRESS WHO FIRST ACQUAINTED ME WITH HER HER CONCEPTION OF THE CHARACTER WAS AS HEAVY AND UNCOMPROMISING AS HER DICTION
1913-147990-0023 SHE BORE HARD ON THE IDEA AND ON THE CONSONANTS AT ALL TIMES SHE WAS HIGHLY TRAGIC DEVOURED BY REMORSE LIGHTNESS OF STRESS OR BEHAVIOR WAS FAR FROM HER HER VOICE WAS HEAVY AND DEEP
1913-147990-0024 AS IF SHE WERE SUMMONING HIM TO THE BAR OF JUDGMENT BUT THE LINES WERE ENOUGH SHE HAD ONLY TO UTTER THEM THEY CREATED THE CHARACTER IN SPITE OF HER THE HEARTLESS WORLD WHICH MARGUERITE RE ENTERED WITH VARVILLE
1913-147990-0025 HAD NEVER BEEN SO GLITTERING AND RECKLESS AS ON THE NIGHT WHEN IT GATHERED IN OLYMPE'S SALON FOR THE FOURTH ACT THERE WERE CHANDELIERS HUNG FROM THE CEILING I REMEMBER MANY SERVANTS IN LIVERY
1913-147990-0026 GAMING TABLES WHERE THE MEN PLAYED WITH PILES OF GOLD AND A STAIRCASE DOWN WHICH THE GUESTS MADE THEIR ENTRANCE AFTER ALL THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED ROUND THE CARD TABLES AND YOUNG DUVAL HAD BEEN WARNED BY PRUDENCE MARGUERITE DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE WITH VARVILLE SUCH A CLOAK
1913-147990-0027 SUCH A FAN SUCH JEWELS AND HER FACE ONE KNEW AT A GLANCE HOW IT WAS WITH HER WHEN ARMAND WITH THE TERRIBLE WORDS LOOK ALL OF YOU I OWE THIS WOMAN NOTHING
1913-147990-0028 FLUNG THE GOLD AND BANK NOTES AT THE HALF SWOONING MARGUERITE LENA COWERED BESIDE ME AND COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS THE CURTAIN ROSE ON THE BEDROOM SCENE
1913-147990-0029 NANINE ALONE COULD HAVE MADE ME CRY I LOVED NANINE TENDERLY AND GASTON HOW ONE CLUNG TO THAT GOOD FELLOW THE NEW YEAR'S PRESENTS WERE NOT TOO MUCH NOTHING COULD BE TOO MUCH NOW I WEPT UNRESTRAINEDLY
1913-147990-0030 WAS WET THROUGH BY THE TIME THAT MORIBUND WOMAN SANK FOR THE LAST TIME INTO THE ARMS OF HER LOVER WHEN WE REACHED THE DOOR OF THE THEATER THE STREETS WERE SHINING WITH RAIN I HAD PRUDENTLY BROUGHT ALONG MISSUS HARLING'S USEFUL COMMENCEMENT PRESENT
1913-147990-0031 I TRAMPED THROUGH THE PUDDLES AND UNDER THE SHOWERY TREES MOURNING FOR MARGUERITE GAUTHIER AS IF SHE HAD DIED ONLY YESTERDAY SIGHING WITH THE SPIRIT OF EIGHTEEN FORTY WHICH HAD SIGHED SO MUCH
1913-147990-0032 AND WHICH HAD REACHED ME ONLY THAT NIGHT ACROSS LONG YEARS AND SEVERAL LANGUAGES THROUGH THE PERSON OF AN INFIRM OLD ACTRESS THE IDEA IS ONE THAT NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN FRUSTRATE WHEREVER AND WHENEVER THAT PIECE IS PUT ON
