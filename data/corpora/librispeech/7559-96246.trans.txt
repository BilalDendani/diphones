7559-96246-0000 IS ALWAYS REALLY AND ESSENTIALLY ONLY NEGATIVE AND NEVER POSITIVE IT IS NOT AN ORIGINAL GRATIFICATION COMING TO US OF ITSELF BUT MUST ALWAYS BE THE SATISFACTION OF A WISH THE WISH
7559-96246-0001 IS THE CONDITION WHICH PRECEDES EVERY PLEASURE BUT WITH THE SATISFACTION THE WISH AND THEREFORE THE PLEASURE CEASE THUS THE SATISFACTION OR THE PLEASING CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN THE DELIVERANCE FROM A PAIN FROM A WANT
7559-96246-0002 FOR SUCH IS NOT ONLY EVERY ACTUAL OPEN SORROW BUT EVERY DESIRE THE IMPORTUNITY OF WHICH DISTURBS OUR PEACE AND INDEED THE DEADENING ENNUI ALSO THAT MAKES LIFE A BURDEN TO US IT IS HOWEVER
7559-96246-0003 DIFFICULTIES AND TROUBLES WITHOUT END ARE OPPOSED TO EVERY PURPOSE AND AT EVERY STEP HINDRANCES ACCUMULATE BUT WHEN FINALLY EVERYTHING IS OVERCOME AND ATTAINED NOTHING CAN EVER BE GAINED
7559-96246-0004 BUT DELIVERANCE FROM SOME SORROW OR DESIRE SO THAT WE FIND OURSELVES JUST IN THE SAME POSITION AS WE OCCUPIED BEFORE THIS SORROW OR DESIRE APPEARED ALL THAT IS EVEN DIRECTLY GIVEN US
7559-96246-0005 THE SATISFACTION AND THE PLEASURE WE CAN ONLY KNOW INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE PRECEDING SUFFERING AND WANT WHICH CEASES WITH ITS APPEARANCE HENCE IT ARISES THAT WE ARE NOT PROPERLY CONSCIOUS OF THE BLESSINGS AND ADVANTAGES WE ACTUALLY POSSESS
7559-96246-0006 NOR DO WE PRIZE THEM BUT THINK OF THEM MERELY AS A MATTER OF COURSE FOR THEY GRATIFY US ONLY NEGATIVELY BY RESTRAINING SUFFERING
7559-96246-0007 ONLY WHEN WE HAVE LOST THEM DO WE BECOME SENSIBLE OF THEIR VALUE FOR THE WANT THE PRIVATION THE SORROW IS THE POSITIVE COMMUNICATING ITSELF DIRECTLY TO US
7559-96246-0008 THAT JUST ON THIS ACCOUNT IT CANNOT BE LASTING SATISFACTION AND GRATIFICATION BUT MERELY DELIVERS US FROM SOME PAIN OR WANT WHICH MUST BE FOLLOWED EITHER BY A NEW PAIN OR BY LANGUOR EMPTY LONGING AND ENNUI
7559-96246-0009 AND ESPECIALLY IN POETRY EVERY EPIC AND DRAMATIC POEM CAN ONLY REPRESENT A STRUGGLE AN EFFORT AND FIGHT FOR HAPPINESS NEVER ENDURING AND COMPLETE HAPPINESS ITSELF IT CONDUCTS ITS HEROES THROUGH A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS TO THE GOAL
7559-96246-0010 AS SOON AS THIS IS REACHED IT HASTENS TO LET THE CURTAIN FALL FOR NOW THERE WOULD REMAIN NOTHING FOR IT TO DO BUT TO SHOW THAT THE GLITTERING GOAL IN WHICH THE HERO EXPECTED TO FIND HAPPINESS HAD ONLY DISAPPOINTED HIM AND THAT
7559-96246-0011 AFTER ITS ATTAINMENT HE WAS NO BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE BECAUSE A GENUINE ENDURING HAPPINESS IS NOT POSSIBLE IT CANNOT BE THE SUBJECT OF ART
7559-96246-0012 BUT ONE ALSO SEES THAT THE IDYLL AS SUCH CANNOT CONTINUE THE POET ALWAYS FINDS THAT IT EITHER BECOMES EPICAL IN HIS HANDS
7559-96246-0013 THIS IS THE COMMONEST CASE OR ELSE IT BECOMES A MERELY DESCRIPTIVE POEM
7559-96246-0014 PURE KNOWING FREE FROM WILL WHICH CERTAINLY AS A MATTER OF FACT IS THE ONLY PURE HAPPINESS WHICH IS NEITHER PRECEDED BY SUFFERING OR WANT NOR NECESSARILY FOLLOWED BY REPENTANCE SORROW EMPTINESS OR SATIETY
7559-96246-0015 WHAT WE SEE IN POETRY WE FIND AGAIN IN MUSIC IN THE MELODIES OF WHICH WE HAVE RECOGNISED THE UNIVERSAL EXPRESSION OF THE INMOST HISTORY OF THE SELF CONSCIOUS WILL THE MOST SECRET LIFE LONGING SUFFERING AND DELIGHT THE EBB AND FLOW OF THE HUMAN HEART
7559-96246-0016 EVEN TO THE MOST PAINFUL DISCORD AND THEN A FINAL RETURN TO THE KEYNOTE WHICH EXPRESSES THE SATISFACTION AND APPEASING OF THE WILL
7559-96246-0017 AND THE CONTINUANCE OF WHICH ANY LONGER WOULD ONLY BE A WEARISOME AND UNMEANING MONOTONY CORRESPONDING TO ENNUI ALL THAT WE INTEND TO BRING OUT CLEARLY
7559-96246-0018 AND THE NEGATIVE NATURE OF ALL HAPPINESS
7559-96246-0019 IS A STRIVING WITHOUT AIM OR END WE FIND THE STAMP OF THIS ENDLESSNESS IMPRINTED UPON ALL THE PARTS OF ITS WHOLE MANIFESTATION FROM ITS MOST UNIVERSAL FORM ENDLESS TIME AND SPACE
7559-96246-0020 UP TO THE MOST PERFECT OF ALL PHENOMENA THE LIFE AND EFFORTS OF MAN WE MAY THEORETICALLY ASSUME THREE EXTREMES OF HUMAN LIFE AND TREAT THEM AS ELEMENTS OF ACTUAL HUMAN LIFE FIRST THE POWERFUL WILL THE STRONG PASSIONS
7559-96246-0021 RADSCHA GUNA IT APPEARS IN GREAT HISTORICAL CHARACTERS IT IS DESCRIBED IN THE EPIC AND THE DRAMA
7559-96246-0022 BY THE DEGREE IN WHICH THEY INFLUENCE THE WILL NOT ACCORDING TO THEIR EXTERNAL RELATIONS SECONDLY PURE KNOWING THE COMPREHENSION OF THE IDEAS
7559-96246-0023 THE LIFE OF GENIUS SATWA GUNA
7559-96246-0024 LIFE BENUMBING LANGUOR TAMA GUNA THE LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUAL FAR FROM BECOMING PERMANENTLY FIXED IN ONE OF THESE EXTREMES SELDOM TOUCHES ANY OF THEM
7559-96246-0025 AND IS FOR THE MOST PART ONLY A WEAK AND WAVERING APPROACH TO ONE OR THE OTHER SIDE A NEEDY DESIRING OF TRIFLING OBJECTS CONSTANTLY RECURRING AND SO ESCAPING ENNUI
7559-96246-0026 IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE HOW MEANINGLESS AND VOID OF SIGNIFICANCE WHEN LOOKED AT FROM WITHOUT HOW DULL AND UNENLIGHTENED BY INTELLECT WHEN FELT FROM WITHIN
7559-96246-0027 IT IS A WEARY LONGING AND COMPLAINING A DREAM LIKE STAGGERING THROUGH THE FOUR AGES OF LIFE TO DEATH
7559-96246-0028 SUCH MEN ARE LIKE CLOCKWORK WHICH IS WOUND UP
7559-96246-0029 AND EVERY TIME A MAN IS BEGOTTEN AND BORN THE CLOCK OF HUMAN LIFE IS WOUND UP ANEW TO REPEAT THE SAME OLD PIECE IT HAS PLAYED INNUMERABLE TIMES BEFORE PASSAGE AFTER PASSAGE
7559-96246-0030 MEASURE AFTER MEASURE WITH INSIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS
7559-96246-0031 IS BUT ANOTHER SHORT DREAM OF THE ENDLESS SPIRIT OF NATURE OF THE PERSISTENT WILL TO LIVE IS ONLY ANOTHER FLEETING FORM WHICH IT CARELESSLY SKETCHES ON ITS INFINITE PAGE SPACE AND TIME
7559-96246-0032 ALLOWS TO REMAIN FOR A TIME SO SHORT THAT IT VANISHES INTO NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THESE AND THEN OBLITERATES TO MAKE NEW ROOM AND YET
7559-96246-0033 THESE EMPTY FANCIES MUST BE PAID FOR BY THE WHOLE WILL TO LIVE IN ALL ITS ACTIVITY WITH MANY AND DEEP SUFFERINGS AND FINALLY WITH A BITTER DEATH LONG FEARED AND COMING AT LAST THIS IS WHY THE SIGHT OF A CORPSE
7559-96246-0034 MAKES US SUDDENLY SO SERIOUS THE LIFE OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL IF WE SURVEY IT AS A WHOLE AND IN GENERAL AND ONLY LAY STRESS UPON ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT FEATURES
7559-96246-0035 IS REALLY ALWAYS A TRAGEDY BUT GONE THROUGH IN DETAIL IT HAS THE CHARACTER OF A COMEDY FOR THE DEEDS AND VEXATIONS OF THE DAY THE RESTLESS IRRITATION OF THE MOMENT THE DESIRES AND FEARS OF THE WEEK
7559-96246-0036 THE MISHAPS OF EVERY HOUR ARE ALL THROUGH CHANCE WHICH IS EVER BENT UPON SOME JEST SCENES OF A COMEDY BUT THE NEVER SATISFIED WISHES THE FRUSTRATED EFFORTS THE HOPES UNMERCIFULLY CRUSHED BY FATE
7559-96246-0037 THE UNFORTUNATE ERRORS OF THE WHOLE LIFE WITH INCREASING SUFFERING AND DEATH AT THE END ARE ALWAYS A TRAGEDY THUS AS IF FATE WOULD ADD DERISION TO THE MISERY OF OUR EXISTENCE
7559-96246-0038 OUR LIFE MUST CONTAIN ALL THE WOES OF TRAGEDY AND YET WE CANNOT EVEN ASSERT THE DIGNITY OF TRAGIC CHARACTERS BUT IN THE BROAD DETAIL OF LIFE MUST INEVITABLY BE THE FOOLISH CHARACTERS
7559-96246-0039 OF A COMEDY BUT HOWEVER MUCH GREAT AND SMALL TRIALS MAY FILL HUMAN LIFE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO CONCEAL ITS INSUFFICIENCY TO SATISFY THE SPIRIT
7559-96246-0040 THEY CANNOT HIDE THE EMPTINESS AND SUPERFICIALITY OF EXISTENCE NOR EXCLUDE ENNUI WHICH IS ALWAYS READY TO FILL UP EVERY PAUSE THAT CARE MAY ALLOW
7559-96246-0041 ALSO IN THE FORM OF A THOUSAND DIFFERENT SUPERSTITIONS THEN FINDS ALL MANNER OF EMPLOYMENT WITH THIS AND WASTES TIME AND STRENGTH UPON IT
7559-96246-0042 MAN CREATES IN HIS OWN IMAGE AND TO THEM HE MUST
7559-96246-0043 EVERY EVENT OF LIFE IS REGARDED AS THE WORK OF THESE BEINGS THE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OCCUPIES HALF THE TIME OF LIFE CONSTANTLY SUSTAINS HOPE AND BY THE CHARM OF ILLUSION OFTEN BECOMES MORE INTERESTING THAN INTERCOURSE WITH REAL BEINGS
7559-96246-0044 IT IS THE EXPRESSION AND SYMPTOM OF THE ACTUAL NEED OF MANKIND
7559-96246-0045 PARTLY FOR OCCUPATION AND DIVERSION AND IF IT OFTEN WORKS IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE FIRST NEED BECAUSE WHEN ACCIDENTS AND DANGERS ARISE VALUABLE TIME AND STRENGTH INSTEAD OF BEING DIRECTED TO WARDING THEM OFF ARE USELESSLY WASTED ON PRAYERS AND OFFERINGS
7559-96246-0046 CONTEMPTIBLE GAIN OF ALL SUPERSTITIONS
7559-96246-0047 IF WE HAVE SO FAR CONVINCED OURSELVES A PRIORI BY THE MOST GENERAL CONSIDERATION BY INVESTIGATION OF THE PRIMARY AND ELEMENTAL FEATURES OF HUMAN LIFE
7559-96246-0048 THAT IN ITS WHOLE PLAN IT IS CAPABLE OF NO TRUE BLESSEDNESS BUT IS IN ITS VERY NATURE SUFFERING IN VARIOUS FORMS AND THROUGHOUT A STATE OF MISERY WE MIGHT NOW AWAKEN THIS CONVICTION MUCH MORE VIVIDLY WITHIN US
7559-96246-0049 CALL UP PICTURES TO THE FANCY AND ILLUSTRATE BY EXAMPLES THE UNSPEAKABLE MISERY WHICH EXPERIENCE AND HISTORY PRESENT WHEREVER ONE MAY LOOK AND IN WHATEVER DIRECTION ONE MAY SEEK BUT THE
7559-96246-0050 CHAPTER WOULD HAVE NO END AND WOULD CARRY US FAR FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE UNIVERSAL WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO PHILOSOPHY AND MOREOVER SUCH A DESCRIPTION MIGHT EASILY BE TAKEN FOR A MERE DECLAMATION ON HUMAN MISERY SUCH AS HAS OFTEN BEEN GIVEN AND
7559-96246-0051 AS SUCH MIGHT BE CHARGED WITH ONE SIDEDNESS BECAUSE IT STARTED FROM PARTICULAR FACTS
7559-96246-0052 SUSPICION OUR PERFECTLY COLD AND PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE INEVITABLE SUFFERING WHICH IS FOUNDED IN THE NATURE OF LIFE IS FREE
7559-96246-0053 IS EVERYWHERE EASILY OBTAINED EVERY ONE WHO HAS AWAKENED FROM THE FIRST DREAM OF YOUTH WHO HAS CONSIDERED HIS OWN EXPERIENCE AND THAT OF OTHERS WHO HAS STUDIED HIMSELF IN LIFE
7559-96246-0054 AND FINALLY IN THE WORKS OF THE GREAT POETS WILL
7559-96246-0055 IS THE KINGDOM OF CHANCE AND ERROR WHICH RULE WITHOUT MERCY IN GREAT THINGS AND IN SMALL AND ALONG WITH
7559-96246-0056 HENCE IT ARISES THAT EVERYTHING BETTER ONLY STRUGGLES THROUGH WITH DIFFICULTY WHAT IS NOBLE AND WISE SELDOM ATTAINS TO EXPRESSION BECOMES EFFECTIVE AND CLAIMS ATTENTION BUT THE ABSURD AND THE PERVERSE IN THE SPHERE OF
7559-96246-0057 REALLY ASSERT A SUPREMACY ONLY DISTURBED BY SHORT INTERRUPTIONS ON THE OTHER HAND EVERYTHING THAT IS EXCELLENT IS ALWAYS A MERE EXCEPTION ONE CASE IN MILLIONS AND THEREFORE IF IT PRESENTS ITSELF IN A LASTING WORK
7559-96246-0058 THIS WHEN IT HAS OUTLIVED THE ENMITY OF ITS CONTEMPORARIES
7559-96246-0059 SPRUNG FROM AN ORDER OF THINGS DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH PREVAILS HERE BUT AS FAR AS THE LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS CONCERNED EVERY BIOGRAPHY IS THE HISTORY OF SUFFERING FOR EVERY LIFE IS AS A RULE
7559-96246-0060 AND SMALL MISFORTUNES WHICH EACH ONE CONCEALS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT OTHERS CAN SELDOM FEEL SYMPATHY OR COMPASSION BUT ALMOST ALWAYS SATISFACTION AT THE SIGHT OF THE WOES FROM WHICH
7559-96246-0061 THEY ARE THEMSELVES FOR THE MOMENT EXEMPT
7559-96246-0062 HE WILL NEVER WISH TO HAVE IT TO LIVE OVER AGAIN BUT RATHER THAN THIS HE WILL MUCH PREFER ABSOLUTE ANNIHILATION
7559-96246-0063 OUR STATE IS SO WRETCHED THAT ABSOLUTE ANNIHILATION WOULD BE DECIDEDLY PREFERABLE IF SUICIDE REALLY OFFERED US THIS SO THAT THE ALTERNATIVE TO BE OR NOT TO BE IN THE FULL SENSE OF THE WORD WAS PLACED BEFORE US
7559-96246-0064 THEN IT WOULD BE UNCONDITIONALLY TO BE CHOSEN AS A CONSUMMATION DEVOUTLY TO BE WISHED
7559-96246-0065 THE CASE SUICIDE IS NOT THE END DEATH IS NOT ABSOLUTE ANNIHILATION IN LIKE MANNER
7559-96246-0066 HIM BEEN CONTRADICTED THAT NO MAN HAS EVER LIVED WHO HAS NOT WISHED MORE THAN ONCE THAT HE HAD NOT TO LIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY ACCORDING TO THIS THE BREVITY OF LIFE WHICH IS SO CONSTANTLY LAMENTED MAY
7559-96246-0067 IF FINALLY WE SHOULD BRING CLEARLY TO A MAN'S SIGHT THE TERRIBLE
7559-96246-0068 HE WOULD BE SEIZED WITH HORROR AND IF WE WERE TO CONDUCT THE CONFIRMED OPTIMIST THROUGH THE HOSPITALS INFIRMARIES AND SURGICAL OPERATING ROOMS THROUGH THE PRISONS TORTURE CHAMBERS AND SLAVE KENNELS OVER BATTLE FIELDS AND PLACES OF EXECUTION
7559-96246-0069 AND FINALLY ALLOW HIM TO GLANCE INTO THE STARVING DUNGEON OF UGOLINO HE TOO WOULD UNDERSTAND AT LAST THE NATURE OF THIS BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS FOR WHENCE DID DANTE TAKE THE MATERIALS FOR HIS HELL
7559-96246-0070 AND YET HE MADE A VERY PROPER HELL OF IT AND WHEN ON THE OTHER HAND HE CAME TO THE TASK OF DESCRIBING HEAVEN AND ITS DELIGHTS
7559-96246-0071 THEREFORE THERE REMAINED NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO BUT INSTEAD OF DESCRIBING THE JOYS OF PARADISE TO REPEAT TO US THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN HIM THERE BY HIS ANCESTOR BY BEATRICE AND
7559-96246-0072 BUT FROM THIS IT IS SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR WHAT MANNER OF WORLD IT IS CERTAINLY HUMAN LIFE LIKE ALL BAD WARE IS COVERED OVER WITH A FALSE LUSTRE WHAT SUFFERS ALWAYS CONCEALS ITSELF ON THE OTHER HAND
7559-96246-0073 WHATEVER POMP OR SPLENDOUR ANY ONE CAN GET HE MAKES A SHOW OF OPENLY AND THE MORE INNER CONTENTMENT DESERTS HIM THE MORE HE DESIRES TO EXIST AS FORTUNATE IN THE OPINION OF OTHERS TO SUCH AN EXTENT DOES FOLLY GO
7559-96246-0074 AND THE OPINION OF OTHERS IS A CHIEF AIM OF THE EFFORTS OF EVERY ONE
7559-96246-0075 ORIGINALLY SIGNIFIES EMPTINESS AND NOTHINGNESS BUT UNDER ALL THIS FALSE SHOW THE MISERIES OF LIFE CAN SO INCREASE AND THIS HAPPENS EVERY DAY
7559-96246-0076 EVEN THIS REFUGE IS DENIED TO THE SUFFERER AND IN THE HANDS OF ENRAGED ENEMIES HE MAY REMAIN EXPOSED TO TERRIBLE AND SLOW TORTURES WITHOUT REMEDY IN VAIN THE SUFFERER THEN CALLS ON HIS GODS FOR HELP
7559-96246-0077 OF WHICH HIS PERSON IS THE OBJECTIVITY AS LITTLE AS AN EXTERNAL POWER CAN CHANGE OR SUPPRESS THIS WILL SO LITTLE CAN A FOREIGN POWER DELIVER IT
7559-96246-0078 A MAN IS ALWAYS THROWN BACK UPON HIMSELF IN VAIN DOES HE MAKE TO HIMSELF GODS IN ORDER TO GET FROM THEM BY PRAYERS AND FLATTERY WHAT CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY HIS OWN WILL POWER THE OLD TESTAMENT MADE THE WORLD AND MAN THE WORK OF A GOD
7559-96246-0079 BUT THE NEW TESTAMENT SAW THAT IN ORDER TO TEACH THAT HOLINESS AND SALVATION FROM THE SORROWS OF THIS WORLD CAN ONLY COME FROM THE WORLD ITSELF IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THIS GOD SHOULD BECOME MAN
7559-96246-0080 IT IS AND REMAINS THE WILL OF MAN UPON WHICH EVERYTHING DEPENDS FOR HIM FANATICS MARTYRS SAINTS OF EVERY FAITH AND NAME HAVE VOLUNTARILY AND GLADLY ENDURED EVERY TORTURE BECAUSE IN THEM THE WILL TO LIVE HAD SUPPRESSED ITSELF
7559-96246-0081 WAS WELCOME TO THEM BUT I DO NOT WISH TO ANTICIPATE THE LATER EXPOSITION FOR THE REST I CANNOT HERE AVOID THE STATEMENT THAT TO ME OPTIMISM WHEN IT IS NOT MERELY THE THOUGHTLESS TALK OF SUCH AS HARBOUR
7559-96246-0082 NOTHING BUT WORDS UNDER THEIR LOW FOREHEADS
