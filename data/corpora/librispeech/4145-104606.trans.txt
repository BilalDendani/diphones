4145-104606-0000 THE LONG ARM OF COINCIDENCE GO SAID ELLA AS SHE HASTENED FROM THE ROOM AND OPEN THE DOOR WHILE I GO UPSTAIRS AND TAKE MY HAT OFF MADGE DID AS SHE WAS TOLD THERE WERE TWO PERSONS AT THE DOOR
4145-104606-0001 JACK MARTYN AND ANOTHER THIS SAID JACK REFERRING TO HIS COMPANION IS A FRIEND OF MINE IT WAS DARK IN THE PASSAGE AND MADGE WAS A LITTLE FLURRIED SHE PERCEIVED THAT JACK HAD A COMPANION AND THAT WAS ALL
4145-104606-0002 GO INTO THE SITTING ROOM I'LL BRING YOU A LAMP IN A MINUTE ELLA HAS GONE TO TAKE HER HAT OFF PRESENTLY RETURNING WITH THE LIGHTED LAMP IN HER HAND PLACING IT ON THE TABLE SHE GLANCED AT JACK'S COMPANION AND STARED
4145-104606-0003 IN HER ASTONISHMENT SHE ALL BUT KNOCKED THE LAMP OVER JACK LAUGHED I BELIEVE HE SAID YOU TWO HAVE MET BEFORE MADGE CONTINUED SPEECHLESS SHE PASSED HER HAND BEFORE HER EYES AS IF TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS NOT DREAMING
4145-104606-0004 JACK LAUGHED AGAIN I REPEAT THAT I BELIEVE YOU TWO HAVE MET BEFORE MADGE DREW HERSELF UP TO HER STRAIGHTEST AND HER STIFFEST HER TONE WAS ICY
4145-104606-0005 THIS WENT ON JACK AIRILY IS A FRIEND OF MINE BRUCE GRAHAM GRAHAM THIS IS MISS BRODIE MADGE ACKNOWLEDGED THE INTRODUCTION WITH AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD WHICH WAS SO FAINT AS TO BE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE
4145-104606-0006 I BEG YOU WILL NOT MENTION IT SHE TURNED AWAY I WILL GO AND TELL ELLA YOU HAVE COME THERE CAME A VOICE FROM BEHIND HER YOU NEEDN'T ELLA IS AWARE OF IT ALREADY AS ELLA CAME INTO THE ROOM
4145-104606-0007 SHE MOVED TO LEAVE IT JACK CAUGHT HER BY THE ARM MADGE DON'T GO AWAY IN A FUME YOU WAIT TILL YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT I HAVE GOT TO SAY DO YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE STANDING IN THE PRESENCE OF A ROMANCE IN REAL LIFE
4145-104606-0008 ON THE VERGE OF A BLOOD CURDLING MYSTERY FACT AREN'T WE GRAHAM MISTER GRAHAM'S LANGUAGE WAS SLIGHTLY LESS EMPHATIC WE ARE OR RATHER WE MAY BE
4145-104606-0009 JACK WAVED HIS ARM EXCITEDLY I SAY IT'S THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING
4145-104606-0010 IT CERTAINLY IS RATHER A STRIKING ILLUSTRATION OF THE LONG ARM OF COINCIDENCE LISTEN TO HIM ISN'T HE COLD BLOODED IF YOU'D HEARD HIM AN HOUR OR TWO AGO HE WAS HOT ENOUGH TO MELT ALL THE ICE CREAM IN TOWN
4145-104606-0011 TAKING UP HIS POSITION ON THE HEARTHRUG IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE
4145-104606-0012 HIS NAME'S GRAHAM HE DIGS IN THE SAME HOUSE I DO TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK
4145-104606-0013 I SAY THIS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO MISUNDERSTAND THE SITUATION THIS MORNING HE LUNCHED AT THE SAME CRIB I DID DIRECTLY HE CAME IN I SAW THAT HE WAS BELOW PAR SO I SAID I ALWAYS AM A SYMPATHETIC SOUL
4145-104606-0014 YOU WON'T FORGET TO LET ME HAVE AN INVITATION TO YOUR FUNERAL AND IN THE MEANTIME PERHAPS YOU'LL LET ME KNOW OF WHAT IT IS YOU'RE DYING NOW HE'S NOT ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO WEAR THEIR HEARTS UPON THEIR SLEEVES FOR DAWS TO PECK AT
4145-104606-0015 MARTYN I'VE BEEN MISBEHAVING MYSELF I WAS NOT SURPRISED AND I TOLD HIM SO
4145-104606-0016 THAT'S NOTHING I REPLIED I'M ALWAYS INSULTING A LADY I MAY EXPLAIN THAT WHEN I MADE THAT REMARK ELLA YOU WERE THE LADY I HAD IN MY MIND'S EYE AT THIS POINT I WOULD PAUSE TO INQUIRE WHY MISS BRODIE
4145-104606-0017 YOU DID NOT TAKE ME INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON I DID YOU DID NOT I DID YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE LUNATIC LADY BECAUSE I SUPPOSE YOU COULD NOT HELP IT SINCE YOU WERE CAUGHT IN THE ACT
4145-104606-0018 BUT YOU SAID NOTHING ABOUT A LUNATIC GENTLEMAN HE WAGGED HIS FINGER PORTENTOUSLY DON'T THINK YOU DECEIVE ME MADGE BRODIE I SMELL A RAT AND ONE OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE JACK DO GO ON
4145-104606-0019 THIS WAS ELLA I WILL GO ON IN MY OWN WAY IF YOU BUSTLE ME I'LL KEEP GOING ON FOR EVER DON'T I TELL YOU THIS IS MY SHOW DO YOU WANT TO QUEER IT WELL AS I WAS ABOUT TO OBSERVE WHEN I WAS INTERRUPTED
4145-104606-0020 BEGINNING TO THINK THAT HIS YARN SMELT SOMEWHAT FISHY WHAT HOUSE THIS WAS THE PLACE HE REPLIED AS COOL AS A CUCUMBER IS CALLED CLOVER COTTAGE WHAT'S THAT I CRIED I ALMOST JUMPED OUT OF MY CHAIR
4145-104606-0021 I SAY THAT THE PLACE IS CALLED CLOVER COTTAGE I HAD TO HOLD ON TO THE HAIR OF MY HEAD WITH BOTH MY HANDS AND WHEREABOUTS MAY CLOVER COTTAGE BE ON WANDSWORTH COMMON WHEN HE SAID THAT
4145-104606-0022 AS CALMLY AS IF HE WERE ASKING ME TO PASS THE SALT I COLLAPSED I DARESAY HE THOUGHT THAT I'D GONE MAD I BEGAN TO WONDER THIS WAS GRAHAM DID YOU LET ME TELL YOU SIR
4145-104606-0023 IN WHICH CASE I SHOULD HAVE PROVED MYSELF MAD BECAUSE AS YOU PERCEIVE FOR YOURSELVES THE MAN'S A MONSTER
4145-104606-0024 THAT IF THE LADY YOU INSULTED WAS NOT THE LADY WHOM I HOPE TO MAKE MY WIFE IT WAS THAT LADY'S FRIEND WHICH IS THE SAME THING IS IT INTERPOSED ELLA YOU HEAR HIM MADGE I HEAR
4145-104606-0025 WHICH IS THE SAME THING CONTINUED JACK AND THEREFORE SIR I MUST ASK YOU TO EXPLAIN HE EXPLAINED I AM BOUND TO ADMIT THAT HE EXPLAINED THERE AND THEN
4145-104606-0026 HE GAVE ME AN EXPLANATION WHICH I HAVE NO HESITATION IN ASSERTING JACK HOLDING HIS LEFT HAND OUT IN FRONT OF HIM BROUGHT HIS RIGHT LIST SOLEMNLY DOWN UPON HIS OPEN PALM WAS THE MOST ASTONISHING I EVER HEARD
4145-104606-0027 JACK SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY I WAS ABOUT TO POINT OUT SEVERAL OTHER THINGS WHICH THAT EXPLANATION SHOWS WITH A VIEW AS I MIGHT PHRASE IT OF IMPROVING THE OCCASION BUT HAVING BEEN INTERRUPTED FOR THE THIRD TIME I REFRAIN
4145-104606-0028 THE EXPLANATION ITSELF YOU WILL HEAR FROM GRAHAM'S OWN LIPS AFTER TEA HE IS HERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING YOU THAT EXPLANATION AFTER TEA I BELIEVE GRAHAM I AM CORRECT IN SAYING SO PERFECTLY
4145-104606-0029 ONLY SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I AM READY TO GIVE MY EXPLANATION NOW I CANNOT BUT FEEL THAT I SHALL OCCUPY AN INVIDIOUS POSITION IN AT ANY RATE MISS BRODIE'S EYES UNTIL I HAVE EXPLAINED THEN FEEL
4145-104606-0030 I'LL BE HANGED IF YOU SHALL EXPLAIN NOW DASH IT MAN I WANT MY TEA I WANT A HIGH TEA A GOOD TEA AT ONCE ELLA SPRANG UP FROM HER CHAIR COME MADGE LET'S GIVE THE MAN HIS TEA
4145-104606-0031 IT WAS A CURIOUS MEAL IF ONLY BECAUSE OF THE CURIOUS TERMS ON WHICH TWO MEMBERS OF THE PARTY STOOD TOWARD EACH OTHER THE TWO GIRLS SAT AT EACH END OF THE TABLE THE MEN ON EITHER SIDE MADGE UNLIKE HER USUAL SELF WAS RESERVED AND FROSTY
4145-104606-0032 ELLA INFLUENCED BY MADGE'S ATTITUDE SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD NOT MAKE UP HER MIND HOW TO TREAT HIM ON HER OWN ACCOUNT HER BEARING TOWARDS HIM TO SAY THE LEAST WAS CHILLY ON THE OTHER HAND
4145-104606-0033 AND MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE THE MEAL WAS OVER MISTER GRAHAM MUST HAVE HEARTILY WISHED THAT HE HAD NEVER SAT DOWN TO IT STILL EVEN MADGE MIGHT HAVE ADMITTED AND PERHAPS IN HER HEART SHE DID ADMIT THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
4145-104606-0034 HE BORE HIMSELF SURPRISINGLY WELL THAT HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS DESERVING OF BETTER TREATMENT HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY TO HERSELF AND PROBABLY QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY TO HIM SHE KEPT A CORNER OF HER EYE UPON HIM ALL THE TIME
4145-104606-0035 THE LINES OF THE MOUTH AND JAW WERE BOLD AND FIRM THE MAN'S WHOLE PERSON WAS SUGGESTIVE OF STRENGTH BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL AND WHEN HE CAME TO TELL THE STORY WHICH JACK MARTYN HAD FORESHADOWED IT WAS DIFFICULT AS ONE LISTENED
