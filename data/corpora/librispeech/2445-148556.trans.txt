2445-148556-0000 SHE HAD PUT ON HER PLAINEST DRESS AND WOUND A CLOSELY PATTERNED VEIL OVER HER LEAST VIVID HAT BUT EVEN THUS TONED DOWN TO THE SITUATION SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BLAZING OUT FROM IT INCONVENIENTLY
2445-148556-0001 THE HABIT OF MEETING YOUNG MEN IN SEQUESTERED SPOTS WAS NOT UNKNOWN TO HER THE NOVELTY WAS IN FEELING ANY EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT IT EVEN NOW SHE WAS DISTURBED
2445-148556-0002 NOT SO MUCH BY THE UNLIKELY CHANCE OF AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER WITH RALPH MARVELL AS BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF SIMILAR MEETINGS FAR FROM ACCIDENTAL WITH THE ROMANTIC AARONSON
2445-148556-0003 NOW ADORNED WITH RALPH'S ENGAGEMENT RING HAD ONCE IN THIS VERY SPOT SURRENDERED ITSELF TO THE RIDING MASTER'S PRESSURE AT THE THOUGHT A WAVE OF PHYSICAL DISGUST PASSED OVER HER BLOTTING OUT ANOTHER MEMORY
2445-148556-0004 AS DISTASTEFUL BUT MORE REMOTE IT WAS REVIVED BY THE APPEARANCE OF A RUDDY MIDDLE SIZED YOUNG MAN HIS STOUTISH FIGURE TIGHTLY BUTTONED INTO A SQUARE SHOULDERED OVER COAT
2445-148556-0005 WHO PRESENTLY APPROACHED ALONG THE PATH THAT LED TO THE ARBOUR SILHOUETTED AGAINST THE SLOPE OF THE ASPHALT THE NEWCOMER REVEALED AN OUTLINE THICK YET COMPACT
2445-148556-0006 WITH A ROUND HEAD SET ON A NECK IN WHICH AT THE FIRST CHANCE PROSPERITY WOULD BE LIKELY TO DEVELOP A RED CREASE HIS FACE WITH ITS ROUNDED SURFACES AND THE SANGUINE INNOCENCE OF A COMPLEXION
2445-148556-0007 BELIED BY PREMATURELY ASTUTE BLACK EYES HAD A LOOK OF JOVIAL CUNNING WHICH UNDINE HAD FORMERLY THOUGHT SMART BUT WHICH NOW STRUCK HER AS MERELY VULGAR SHE FELT THAT IN THE MARVELL SET
2445-148556-0008 ELMER MOFFATT WOULD HAVE BEEN STAMPED AS NOT A GENTLEMAN NEVERTHELESS SOMETHING IN HIS LOOK SEEMED TO PROMISE THE CAPACITY TO DEVELOP INTO ANY CHARACTER HE MIGHT CARE TO ASSUME
2445-148556-0009 THAT OF A GENTLEMAN WOULD BE AMONG THEM HE HAD ALWAYS HAD A BRISK SWAGGERING STEP AND THE FAINTLY IMPUDENT TILT OF THE HEAD THAT SHE HAD ONCE THOUGHT DASHING
2445-148556-0010 BUT WHEREAS THIS LOOK HAD FORMERLY DENOTED A SOMEWHAT DESPERATE DEFIANCE OF THE WORLD AND ITS JUDGMENTS
2445-148556-0011 AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT THE CHANGE IMPLIED AS HE DREW NEARER THE YOUNG MAN'S AIR OF ASSURANCE WAS REPLACED BY AN EXPRESSION OF MILDLY HUMOROUS SURPRISE WELL THIS IS WHITE OF YOU UNDINE HE SAID
2445-148556-0012 TAKING HER LIFELESS FINGERS INTO HIS DAPPERLY GLOVED HAND THROUGH HER VEIL SHE FORMED THE WORDS I SAID I'D COME HE LAUGHED THAT'S SO AND YOU SEE I BELIEVED YOU
2445-148556-0013 SHE INTERRUPTED NERVOUSLY THAT'S SO TOO SUPPOSE WE WALK ALONG A LITTLE WAYS IT'S RATHER CHILLY STANDING ROUND HE TURNED DOWN THE PATH THAT DESCENDED TOWARD THE RAMBLE
2445-148556-0014 AND THE GIRL MOVED ON BESIDE HIM WITH HER LONG FLOWING STEPS WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THE COMPARATIVE SHELTER OF THE INTERLACING TREES MOFFATT PAUSED AGAIN TO SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK
2445-148556-0015 I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU UNDINE AND AFTER A FIRST MOMENT OF RELUCTANCE SHE SUBMISSIVELY THREW BACK HER VEIL HE LET HIS EYES REST ON HER IN SILENCE THEN HE SAID JUDICIALLY
2445-148556-0016 YOU'VE FILLED OUT SOME BUT YOU'RE PALER
2445-148556-0017 THERE'S MIGHTY FEW WOMEN AS WELL WORTH LOOKING AT AND I'M OBLIGED TO YOU FOR LETTING ME HAVE THE CHANCE AGAIN
2445-148556-0018 BUT SHE SOFTENED HER FROWN TO A QUIVERING SMILE I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU TOO ELMER I AM REALLY HE RETURNED HER SMILE WHILE HIS GLANCE CONTINUED TO STUDY HER HUMOROUSLY
2445-148556-0019 YOU DIDN'T BETRAY THE FACT LAST NIGHT MISS SPRAGG I WAS SO TAKEN ABACK I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT IN ALASKA SOMEWHERE THE YOUNG MAN SHAPED HIS LIPS INTO THE MUTE WHISTLE BY WHICH HE HABITUALLY VENTED HIS SURPRISE

2445-148556-0030 B DRISCOLL'S PRIVATE SECRETARIES HE BROUGHT OUT THE FACT WITH MOCK SOLEMNITY BUT TO UNDINE THOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY IMPRESSIVE THE STATEMENT DID NOT IMMEDIATELY PRESENT ITSELF AS A SUBJECT FOR PLEASANTRY
2445-148556-0031 ELMER MOFFATT YOU ARE

2445-148556-0043 INTO A FISSURE OF THE ASPHALT AT LENGTH HE WENT ON IN A TONE THAT SHOWED A FIRST FAINT TRACE OF IRRITATION

2445-148556-0061 SWINGING ABOUT TO FOLLOW HER AS SHE HURRIEDLY BEGAN TO RETRACE HER STEPS THE MARCH TWILIGHT HAD FALLEN
2445-148556-0062 WHEN UNDINE REGAINED ITS MONUMENTAL THRESHOLD SHE SLIPPED THROUGH THE MARBLE VESTIBULE AND SOARED SKYWARD IN THE MIRROR LINED LIFT HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF THE DIRECTION SHE WAS TAKING
2445-148556-0063 WHAT SHE WANTED WAS SOLITUDE AND THE TIME TO PUT SOME ORDER INTO HER THOUGHTS AND SHE HOPED TO STEAL INTO HER ROOM WITHOUT MEETING HER MOTHER THROUGH HER THICK VEIL
2445-148556-0064 IN A YELLOW BLUR FROM WHICH AS SHE ENTERED A FIGURE DETACHED ITSELF AND WITH A START OF ANNOYANCE SHE SAW RALPH MARVELL RISE FROM THE PERUSAL OF THE FICTION NUMBER OF A MAGAZINE WHICH HAD REPLACED
