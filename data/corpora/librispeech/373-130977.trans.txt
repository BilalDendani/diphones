373-130977-0000 FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER SEVENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN JAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
373-130977-0001 MY LAST PAPER ASSIGNED SEVERAL REASONS WHY THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE BEST SECURED BY UNION AGAINST THE DANGER IT MAY BE EXPOSED TO BY JUST CAUSES OF WAR GIVEN TO OTHER NATIONS
373-130977-0002 AND THOSE REASONS SHOW THAT SUCH CAUSES WOULD NOT ONLY BE MORE RARELY GIVEN BUT WOULD ALSO BE MORE EASILY ACCOMMODATED BY A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THAN EITHER BY THE STATE GOVERNMENTS OR THE PROPOSED LITTLE CONFEDERACIES
373-130977-0003 BUT THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA AGAINST DANGERS FROM FOREIGN FORCE DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON THEIR FORBEARING TO GIVE JUST CAUSES OF WAR TO OTHER NATIONS BUT ALSO ON THEIR PLACING AND CONTINUING THEMSELVES
373-130977-0004 IN SUCH A SITUATION AS NOT TO INVITE HOSTILITY OR INSULT FOR IT NEED NOT BE OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE PRETENDED AS WELL AS JUST CAUSES OF WAR IT IS TOO TRUE HOWEVER DISGRACEFUL IT MAY BE TO HUMAN NATURE
373-130977-0005 SUCH AS THIRST FOR MILITARY GLORY REVENGE FOR PERSONAL AFFRONTS AMBITION OR PRIVATE COMPACTS TO AGGRANDIZE OR SUPPORT THEIR PARTICULAR FAMILIES OR PARTISANS THESE AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MOTIVES WHICH AFFECT ONLY THE MIND OF THE SOVEREIGN
373-130977-0006 OFTEN LEAD HIM TO ENGAGE IN WARS NOT SANCTIFIED BY JUSTICE OR THE VOICE AND INTERESTS OF HIS PEOPLE BUT INDEPENDENT OF THESE INDUCEMENTS TO WAR WHICH ARE MORE PREVALENT IN ABSOLUTE MONARCHIES BUT WHICH WELL DESERVE OUR ATTENTION
373-130977-0007 AND CAN SUPPLY THEIR MARKETS CHEAPER THAN THEY CAN THEMSELVES NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EFFORTS TO PREVENT IT BY BOUNTIES ON THEIR OWN OR DUTIES ON FOREIGN FISH
373-130977-0008 WITH THEM AND WITH MOST OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS WE ARE RIVALS IN NAVIGATION AND THE CARRYING TRADE AND WE SHALL DECEIVE OURSELVES IF WE SUPPOSE THAT ANY OF THEM WILL REJOICE TO SEE IT FLOURISH
373-130977-0009 FOR AS OUR CARRYING TRADE CANNOT INCREASE WITHOUT IN SOME DEGREE DIMINISHING THEIRS IT IS MORE THEIR INTEREST AND WILL BE MORE THEIR POLICY TO RESTRAIN THAN TO PROMOTE IT
373-130977-0010 IN THE TRADE TO CHINA AND INDIA WE INTERFERE WITH MORE THAN ONE NATION INASMUCH AS IT ENABLES US TO PARTAKE IN ADVANTAGES WHICH THEY HAD IN A MANNER MONOPOLIZED AND AS WE THEREBY SUPPLY OURSELVES WITH COMMODITIES
373-130977-0011 WHICH WE USED TO PURCHASE FROM THEM THE EXTENSION OF OUR OWN COMMERCE IN OUR OWN VESSELS CANNOT GIVE PLEASURE TO ANY NATIONS WHO POSSESS TERRITORIES ON OR NEAR THIS CONTINENT
373-130977-0012 BECAUSE THE CHEAPNESS AND EXCELLENCE OF OUR PRODUCTIONS ADDED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF VICINITY AND THE ENTERPRISE AND ADDRESS OF OUR MERCHANTS AND NAVIGATORS WILL GIVE US A GREATER SHARE IN THE ADVANTAGES WHICH THOSE TERRITORIES AFFORD
373-130977-0013 THAN CONSISTS WITH THE WISHES OR POLICY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SOVEREIGNS SPAIN THINKS IT CONVENIENT TO SHUT THE MISSISSIPPI AGAINST US ON THE ONE SIDE AND BRITAIN EXCLUDES US FROM THE SAINT LAWRENCE ON THE OTHER
373-130977-0014 IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT JEALOUSIES AND UNEASINESSES MAY GRADUALLY SLIDE INTO THE MINDS AND CABINETS OF OTHER NATIONS AND THAT WE ARE NOT TO EXPECT THAT THEY SHOULD REGARD OUR ADVANCEMENT IN UNION IN POWER AND CONSEQUENCE BY LAND AND BY SEA
373-130977-0015 AND THAT WHENEVER SUCH INDUCEMENTS MAY FIND FIT TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OPERATION PRETENSES TO COLOR AND JUSTIFY THEM WILL NOT BE WANTING WISELY THEREFORE DO THEY CONSIDER UNION AND A GOOD NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
373-130977-0016 THE ARMS AND THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY AS THE SAFETY OF THE WHOLE IS THE INTEREST OF THE WHOLE AND CANNOT BE PROVIDED FOR WITHOUT GOVERNMENT EITHER ONE OR MORE OR MANY LET US INQUIRE WHETHER ONE GOOD GOVERNMENT IS NOT
373-130977-0017 RELATIVE TO THE OBJECT IN QUESTION MORE COMPETENT THAN ANY OTHER GIVEN NUMBER WHATEVER
373-130977-0018 IN WHATEVER PART OF THE UNION THEY MAY BE FOUND
373-130977-0019 THAN STATE GOVERNMENTS OR SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES CAN POSSIBLY DO FOR WANT OF CONCERT AND UNITY OF SYSTEM IT CAN PLACE THE MILITIA UNDER ONE PLAN OF DISCIPLINE AND BY PUTTING THEIR OFFICERS IN A PROPER LINE OF SUBORDINATION TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE
373-130977-0020 WILL AS IT WERE CONSOLIDATE THEM INTO ONE CORPS AND THEREBY RENDER THEM MORE EFFICIENT THAN IF DIVIDED INTO THIRTEEN OR INTO THREE OR FOUR DISTINCT INDEPENDENT COMPANIES
373-130977-0021 WHAT WOULD THE MILITIA OF BRITAIN BE IF THE ENGLISH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND IF THE SCOTCH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF SCOTLAND AND IF THE WELSH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF WALES SUPPOSE AN INVASION
373-130977-0022 WOULD THOSE THREE GOVERNMENTS IF THEY AGREED AT ALL BE ABLE WITH ALL THEIR RESPECTIVE FORCES TO OPERATE AGAINST THE ENEMY SO EFFECTUALLY AS THE SINGLE GOVERNMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN WOULD WE HAVE HEARD MUCH OF THE FLEETS OF BRITAIN
373-130977-0023 AND THE TIME MAY COME IF WE ARE WISE WHEN THE FLEETS OF AMERICA MAY ENGAGE ATTENTION BUT IF ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT SO REGULATED THE NAVIGATION OF BRITAIN AS TO MAKE IT A NURSERY FOR SEAMEN
373-130977-0024 IF ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT CALLED FORTH ALL THE NATIONAL MEANS AND MATERIALS FOR FORMING FLEETS THEIR PROWESS AND THEIR THUNDER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED LET ENGLAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET
373-130977-0025 LET SCOTLAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET LET WALES HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET LET IRELAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET
373-130977-0026 WHAT FLEETS COULD THEY EVER HOPE TO HAVE IF ONE WAS ATTACKED WOULD THE OTHERS FLY TO ITS SUCCOR AND SPEND THEIR BLOOD AND MONEY IN ITS DEFENSE WOULD THERE BE NO DANGER OF THEIR BEING FLATTERED INTO NEUTRALITY BY ITS SPECIOUS PROMISES
373-130977-0027 OR SEDUCED BY A TOO GREAT FONDNESS FOR PEACE TO DECLINE HAZARDING THEIR TRANQUILLITY AND PRESENT SAFETY FOR THE SAKE OF NEIGHBORS OF WHOM PERHAPS THEY HAVE BEEN JEALOUS AND WHOSE IMPORTANCE THEY ARE CONTENT TO SEE DIMINISHED
373-130977-0028 ALTHOUGH SUCH CONDUCT WOULD NOT BE WISE IT WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE NATURAL THE HISTORY OF THE STATES OF GREECE AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES ABOUNDS WITH SUCH INSTANCES AND IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT WHAT HAS SO OFTEN HAPPENED WOULD
373-130977-0029 WHO SHALL COMMAND THE ALLIED ARMIES AND FROM WHICH OF THEM SHALL HE RECEIVE HIS ORDERS WHO SHALL SETTLE THE TERMS OF PEACE AND IN CASE OF DISPUTES WHAT UMPIRE SHALL DECIDE BETWEEN THEM AND COMPEL ACQUIESCENCE
373-130977-0030 VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES AND INCONVENIENCES WOULD BE INSEPARABLE FROM SUCH A SITUATION WHEREAS ONE GOVERNMENT WATCHING OVER THE GENERAL AND COMMON INTERESTS AND COMBINING AND DIRECTING THE POWERS AND RESOURCES OF THE WHOLE
373-130977-0031 WOULD BE FREE FROM ALL THESE EMBARRASSMENTS AND CONDUCE FAR MORE TO THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE BUT WHATEVER MAY BE OUR SITUATION WHETHER FIRMLY UNITED UNDER ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT OR SPLIT INTO A NUMBER OF CONFEDERACIES
373-130977-0032 CERTAIN IT IS THAT FOREIGN NATIONS WILL KNOW AND VIEW IT EXACTLY AS IT IS AND THEY WILL ACT TOWARD US ACCORDINGLY IF THEY SEE THAT OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IS EFFICIENT AND WELL ADMINISTERED
373-130977-0033 OUR TRADE PRUDENTLY REGULATED OUR MILITIA PROPERLY ORGANIZED AND DISCIPLINED OUR RESOURCES AND FINANCES DISCREETLY MANAGED OUR CREDIT RE ESTABLISHED OUR PEOPLE FREE CONTENTED AND UNITED
373-130977-0034 OR SPLIT INTO THREE OR FOUR INDEPENDENT AND PROBABLY DISCORDANT REPUBLICS OR CONFEDERACIES ONE INCLINING TO BRITAIN ANOTHER TO FRANCE AND A THIRD TO SPAIN AND PERHAPS PLAYED OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER BY THE THREE
373-130977-0035 WHAT A POOR PITIFUL FIGURE WILL AMERICA MAKE IN THEIR EYES HOW LIABLE WOULD SHE BECOME NOT ONLY TO THEIR CONTEMPT BUT TO THEIR OUTRAGE AND HOW SOON WOULD DEAR BOUGHT EXPERIENCE PROCLAIM
373-130977-0036 THAT WHEN A PEOPLE OR FAMILY SO DIVIDE IT NEVER FAILS TO BE AGAINST THEMSELVES
