100-121669-0000 TOM THE PIPER'S SON
100-121669-0001 THE PIG WAS EAT AND TOM WAS BEAT AND TOM RAN CRYING DOWN THE STREET
100-121669-0002 HE NEVER DID ANY WORK EXCEPT TO PLAY THE PIPES AND HE PLAYED SO BADLY THAT FEW PENNIES EVER FOUND THEIR WAY INTO HIS POUCH IT WAS WHISPERED AROUND THAT OLD BARNEY WAS NOT VERY HONEST
100-121669-0003 BUT HE WAS SO SLY AND CAUTIOUS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT OF STEALING ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS HAD BEEN MISSED AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD MAN'S WAY BARNEY HAD ONE SON NAMED TOM
100-121669-0004 AND THEY LIVED ALL ALONE IN A LITTLE HUT AWAY AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE STREET FOR TOM'S MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN HE WAS A BABY YOU MAY NOT SUPPOSE THAT TOM WAS A VERY GOOD BOY SINCE HE HAD SUCH A QUEER FATHER BUT NEITHER WAS HE VERY BAD
100-121669-0005 UNDER HIS FATHER'S GUIDANCE HE FELL INTO BAD WAYS ONE MORNING TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON WAS HUNGRY WHEN THE DAY BEGUN HE WANTED A BUN AND ASKED FOR ONE BUT SOON FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE NONE
100-121669-0006 WHAT SHALL WE DO HE ASKED HIS FATHER GO HUNGRY REPLIED BARNEY UNLESS YOU WANT TO TAKE MY PIPES AND PLAY IN THE VILLAGE
100-121669-0007 NO ANSWERED TOM SHAKING HIS HEAD NO ONE WILL GIVE ME A PENNY FOR PLAYING
100-121669-0008 IF I WENT TO HIS HOUSE HE DID LAST WEEK YOU KNOW
100-121669-0009 SO TOM TOOK HIS FATHER'S PIPES AND WALKED OVER THE HILL TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON LEARNED TO PLAY WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
100-121669-0010 AND HE PLAYED THIS ONE TUNE AS BADLY AS HIS FATHER HIMSELF PLAYED SO THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ANNOYED WHEN THEY HEARD HIM AND OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STOP WHEN HE CAME TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE TOM STARTED UP THE PIPES
100-121669-0011 AND BEGAN TO PLAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE FARMER WAS IN HIS WOODSHED SAWING WOOD SO HE DID NOT HEAR THE PIPES AND THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS DEAF AND COULD NOT HEAR THEM
100-121669-0012 THE FARMER HAD STOPPED SAWING TO REST JUST THEN AND WHEN HE HEARD THE SINGING HE RUSHED OUT OF THE SHED AND CHASED TOM AWAY WITH A BIG STICK OF WOOD THE BOY WENT BACK TO HIS FATHER AND SAID SORROWFULLY FOR HE WAS MORE HUNGRY THAN BEFORE
100-121669-0013 THE FARMER GAVE ME NOTHING BUT A SCOLDING BUT THERE WAS A VERY NICE PIG RUNNING AROUND THE YARD HOW BIG WAS IT ASKED BARNEY OH JUST ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE A NICE DINNER FOR YOU AND ME
100-121669-0014 AND SO HE WENT SOFTLY UP TO THE PIG STY AND REACHED OVER AND GRABBED THE LITTLE PIG BY THE EARS THE PIG SQUEALED OF COURSE BUT THE FARMER WAS MAKING SO MUCH NOISE HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT HEAR IT
100-121669-0015 AND IN A MINUTE TOM HAD THE PIG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM AND WAS RUNNING BACK HOME WITH IT THE PIPER WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE THE PIG AND SAID TO TOM YOU ARE A GOOD SON AND THE PIG IS VERY NICE AND FAT WE SHALL HAVE A DINNER FIT FOR A KING
100-121669-0016 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE PIPER HAD THE PIG KILLED AND CUT INTO PIECES AND BOILING IN THE POT ONLY THE TAIL WAS LEFT OUT FOR TOM WANTED TO MAKE A WHISTLE OF IT AND AS THERE WAS PLENTY TO EAT BESIDES THE TAIL HIS FATHER LET HIM HAVE IT
100-121669-0017 THE PIPER AND HIS SON HAD A FINE DINNER THAT DAY AND SO GREAT WAS THEIR HUNGER THAT THE LITTLE PIG WAS ALL EATEN UP AT ONE MEAL THEN BARNEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP AND TOM SAT ON A BENCH OUTSIDE THE DOOR
100-121669-0018 AND BEGAN TO MAKE A WHISTLE OUT OF THE PIG'S TAIL WITH HIS POCKET KNIFE NOW FARMER BOWSER WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAWING THE WOOD FOUND IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE PIG SO HE TOOK A PAIL OF MEAL AND WENT TO THE PIGSTY
100-121669-0019 BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE STY THERE WAS NO PIG TO BE SEEN AND HE SEARCHED ALL ROUND THE PLACE FOR A GOOD HOUR WITHOUT FINDING IT
100-121669-0020 SO HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND BUCKLED A STRAP AROUND HIS WAIST AND WENT DOWN TO THE VILLAGE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OUT WHO HAD STOLEN HIS PIG UP AND DOWN THE STREET HE WENT AND IN AND OUT THE LANES
100-121669-0021 BUT NO TRACES OF THE PIG COULD HE FIND ANYWHERE AND THAT WAS NO GREAT WONDER FOR THE PIG WAS EATEN BY THAT TIME AND ITS BONES PICKED CLEAN FINALLY THE FARMER CAME TO THE END OF THE STREET WHERE THE PIPER LIVED IN HIS LITTLE HUT
100-121669-0022 AND THERE HE SAW TOM SITTING ON A BENCH AND BLOWING ON A WHISTLE MADE FROM A PIG'S TAIL WHERE DID YOU GET THAT TAIL ASKED THE FARMER I FOUND IT SAID NAUGHTY TOM BEGINNING TO BE FRIGHTENED LET ME SEE IT DEMANDED THE FARMER
100-121669-0023 AND WHEN HE HAD LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY HE CRIED OUT THIS TAIL BELONGED TO MY LITTLE PIG FOR I KNOW VERY WELL THE CURL AT THE END OF IT TELL ME YOU RASCAL WHERE IS THE PIG THEN TOM FELL IN A TREMBLE FOR HE KNEW HIS WICKEDNESS WAS DISCOVERED
100-121669-0024 THE PIG IS EAT YOUR HONOR HE ANSWERED THE FARMER SAID NEVER A WORD BUT HIS FACE GREW BLACK WITH ANGER AND UNBUCKLING THE STRAP THAT WAS ABOUT HIS WAIST HE WAVED IT AROUND HIS HEAD AND WHACK
100-121669-0025 CAME THE STRAP OVER TOM'S BACK OW OW CRIED THE BOY AND STARTED TO RUN DOWN THE STREET WHACK WHACK FELL THE STRAP OVER HIS SHOULDER FOR THE FARMER FOLLOWED AT HIS HEELS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET
100-121669-0026 A GOOD BEATING AND TOM WAS SO SCARED THAT HE NEVER STOPPED RUNNING UNTIL HE CAME TO THE END OF THE VILLAGE AND HE BAWLED LUSTILY THE WHOLE WAY AND CRIED OUT AT EVERY STEP
100-121669-0027 IT WAS DARK BEFORE HE CAME BACK TO HIS HOME AND HIS FATHER WAS STILL ASLEEP SO TOM CREPT INTO THE HUT AND WENT TO BED BUT HE HAD RECEIVED A GOOD LESSON AND NEVER AFTER THAT COULD THE OLD PIPER INDUCE HIM TO STEAL
100-121669-0028 WHEN TOM SHOWED BY HIS ACTIONS HIS INTENTION OF BEING HONEST HE SOON GOT A JOB OF WORK TO DO AND BEFORE LONG HE WAS ABLE TO EARN A LIVING MORE EASILY AND A GREAT DEAL MORE HONESTLY
100-121669-0029 THAN WHEN HE STOLE THE PIG TO GET A DINNER AND SUFFERED A SEVERE BEATING AS A PUNISHMENT
