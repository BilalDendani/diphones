3079-164971-0000 AND PROTECTED FROM WILD BEASTS BY THE USUAL HEAPED ROCKS LEAVING ONLY A NARROW PASSAGE
3079-164971-0001 BUT THEY MADE BRIEF STAY IN A LOCALITY WHERE THE FOOD AND ODORS WERE NOT QUITE TO THEIR ACCUSTOMED TASTE
3079-164971-0002 THERE CAME AN AUTUMN MORNING WHEN AB AND OAK WHO HAD MET AT DAYBREAK DETERMINED TO VISIT THE SHELL PEOPLE AND GO WITH THEM UPON A FISHING EXPEDITION THE SHELL PEOPLE OFTEN FISHED FROM BOATS AND THE BOATS WERE EXCELLENT
3079-164971-0003 EACH CONSISTED OF FOUR OR FIVE SHORT LOGS OF THE MOST BUOYANT WOOD
3079-164971-0004 IT HAD BEEN LEARNED THAT THE WAVES SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERED
3079-164971-0005 IT WAS FUN FOR THE YOUNG MEN WHOSE TALE IS TOLD HERE TO GO WITH THE SHELL PEOPLE AND ASSIST IN SPEARING FISH OR DRAWING THEM FROM THE RIVER'S DEPTHS UPON RUDE HOOKS AND THE SHELL PEOPLE DID NOT OBJECT
3079-164971-0006 BUT WERE RATHER PROUD OF THE ATTENDANCE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE HILLSIDE ARISTOCRACY THE MORNING WAS ONE TO MAKE MEN FAR OLDER THAN THESE TWO
3079-164971-0007 THE MAST HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FALL AND THE NUTS LAY THICKLY AMONG THE LEAVES EVERY MORNING AND MORE REGULARLY THAN IT COMES NOW THERE WAS A SPREAD OF GLISTENING HOAR FROST UPON THE LOWLANDS AND THE LITTLE OPEN LANDS IN THE FOREST
3079-164971-0008 AND UPON EVERY SPOT NOT TREE PROTECTED
3079-164971-0009 IT CAME MOST STRIKINGLY IN SPRING AND AUTUMN
3079-164971-0010 DOUBTLESS THERE CAME A GREATER VIGOR TO THEM IN THE KEEN AIR OF THE HOAR FROST TIME
3079-164971-0011 TEMPERATE WITH A WONDERFUL KEENNESS TO IT
3079-164971-0012 EVEN IN THE DAYS OF THE CAVE MEN THE GULF STREAM SWINGING FROM THE EQUATOR IN THE GREAT WARM CURRENT ALREADY FORMED LAVED THE THEN PENINSULA AS IT NOW LAVES THE BRITISH ISLES THE CLIMATE AS HAS BEEN TOLD
3079-164971-0013 WAS ALMOST AS EQUABLE THEN AS NOW BUT WITH A CERTAIN CRISPNESS WHICH WAS A HERITAGE FROM THE GLACIAL EPOCH
3079-164971-0014 IT WAS A TIME TO LIVE IN AND THE TWO WERE MERRY ON THEIR JOURNEY IN THE GLITTERING MORNING THE YOUNG MEN IDLED ON THEIR WAY AND WASTED AN HOUR OR TWO IN VAIN ATTEMPTS TO APPROACH A FEEDING DEER NEARLY ENOUGH FOR EFFECTIVE SPEAR THROWING
3079-164971-0015 AND THERE LEARNED THAT THE PARTY HAD ALREADY GONE THEY DECIDED THAT THEY MIGHT PERHAPS OVERTAKE THE FISHERMEN AND SO WITH THE HUNTER'S EASY LOPE STARTED BRISKLY DOWN THE RIVER BANK THEY WERE NOT DESTINED TO FISH THAT DAY
3079-164971-0016 THREE OR FOUR MILES HAD BEEN PASSED AND A STRAIGHT STRETCH OF THE RIVER HAD BEEN ATTAINED AT THE END OF WHICH
3079-164971-0017 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE IN SIGHT PERCHED COMFORTABLY UPON A ROCK THE SIDES OF WHICH WERE SO PRECIPITOUS THAT THEY AFFORDED A FOOTHOLD ONLY FOR HUMAN BEINGS WAS A YOUNG WOMAN OF THE SHELL PEOPLE WHO HAD BEFORE ATTRACTED AB'S ATTENTION
3079-164971-0018 AND SOMETHING OF HIS ADMIRATION SHE WAS FISHING DILIGENTLY SHE HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE FISHING PARTY TO BE TAKEN UP ON THEIR RETURN BECAUSE IN THE RUSH OF WATERS ABOUT THE BASE OF THE ROCK WAS A HAUNT OF A SMALL FISH ESTEEMED PARTICULARLY
3079-164971-0019 IT WAS NOT THIS YOUNG WOMAN
3079-164971-0020 BUT THE MAIDEN INTERESTED HIM
3079-164971-0021 TO CARRY HER AWAY TO A NEW HOME WITH HIM
3079-164971-0022 THAT HE WANTED TO KNOW HER BETTER THERE MIGHT HE DIDN'T KNOW
3079-164971-0023 I'LL SWIM TO THE ROCK
3079-164971-0024 AND OAK LAUGHED LOUDLY SHORT TIME ELAPSED BETWEEN DECISION AND ACTION IN THOSE DAYS
3079-164971-0025 AND THOUGH THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A TEST WAS CONFIDENT THAT AMONG ALL THE SHELL PEOPLE
3079-164971-0026 WERE NOT HIS ARMS AND LEGS LONGER AND STRONGER THAN THEIRS AND HIS CHEST DEEPER HE FELT THAT HE COULD OUTSWIM EASILY ANY BOLD FISHERMAN AMONG THEM AND AS FOR THIS GIRL HE WOULD OVERTAKE HER VERY QUICKLY
3079-164971-0027 AND DRAW HER TO THE BANK AND THEN THERE WOULD BE AN INTERVIEW OF MUCH ENJOYMENT AT LEAST TO HIM HIS STRONG ARM SWEPT THE WATER BACK AND HIS STRONG LEGS WORKING WITH THEM
3079-164971-0028 DROVE HIS BODY FORWARD SWIFTLY TOWARD THE BROWN OBJECT NOT VERY FAR AHEAD ALONG THE BANK RAN THE LAUGHING AND SHOUTING OAK YARD BY YARD
3079-164971-0029 SHE WAS SWIMMING BREAST FORWARD AS WAS HE FOR THAT WAS HIS ONLY WAY SHE WITH A DOG LIKE PADDLING STROKE AND OFTEN SHE TURNED HER HEAD TO LOOK BACKWARD AT THE MAN SHE DID NOT EVEN YET
3079-164971-0030 APPEAR AFFRIGHTED AND THIS AB WONDERED AT FOR IT WAS SELDOM THAT A GIRL OF THE TIME THUS HUNTED WAS NOT AND WITH REASON TERRIFIED SHE POSSIBLY UNDERSTOOD
3079-164971-0031 FOR SHE AND HER PURSUER HAD OFTEN MET BUT THERE WAS AT LEAST REASON ENOUGH FOR AVOIDING TOO CLOSE CONTACT ON THIS DAY SHE SWAM ON STEADILY AND AS STEADILY AB GAINED UPON HER
3079-164971-0032 AND PLAIN AND WOODLAND WENT THE CHASE WHILE THE PANTING AND CHEERING OAK STRONG LEGGED AND ENDURING AS HE WAS BARELY KEPT PACE WITH THE TWO HEADS HE COULD SEE BOBBING NOT FAR APART NOW IN THE TOSSING WATERS
3079-164971-0033 AB HAD LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN OAK
3079-164971-0034 HIS THOUGHT WAS ONLY WHAT NOW MADE UP AN OVERMASTERING AIM HE MUST REACH AND SEIZE UPON THE GIRL BEFORE HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER
3079-164971-0035 AND THE OCCASIONAL UP FLIP OF HER BROWN HEELS AS SHE WENT HIGH IN HER STROKE
3079-164971-0036 IN A FIERCER STROKE AND CAME SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD DISCERN HER OUTLINE THROUGH THE WATER
3079-164971-0037 HOW COULD A WOMAN OUTSWIM A MAN LIKE HIM IT WAS JUST AT THE TIME WHEN THIS THOUGHT CAME THAT AB SAW THE SHELL GIRL LIFT HER HEAD AND TURN IT TOWARD HIM AND LAUGH LAUGH RECKLESSLY
3079-164971-0038 ALMOST IN HIS VERY FACE SO CLOSE TOGETHER WERE THEY NOW AND THEN SHE TAUGHT HIM SOMETHING
3079-164971-0039 BUT THIS WAS ONLY A DEMONSTRATION MADE IN SHEER AUDACITY AND BLITHESOME INSOLENCE
3079-164971-0040 SHE WAS LIKE THE BIRDS WHICH SWIM AND DIVE AND DIP AND KNOW OF NOTHING WHICH THEY FEAR IF ONLY THEY ARE IN THE WATER FAR ENOUGH
3079-164971-0041 IT WAS NOT THAT THE SHELL GIRL WAS OTHER THAN AT HOME ON LAND SHE WAS QUITE AT HOME THERE AND REASONABLY FLEET BUT THE CREEK AND RIVER HAD SO BEEN HER ELEMENT FROM BABYHOOD THAT THE CHASE OF THE HILL MAN HAD BEEN
3079-164971-0042 AB LIFTED HIMSELF IN THE WATERS AND GAZED UPON THE DARK SPOT FAR AWAY AND PIQUED AND MADDENED PUT FORTH
3079-164971-0043 WHAT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A DOT UPON THE SURFACE FAR AHEAD
3079-164971-0044 AND IN A MOMENT IT WAS CARRIED AROUND THE BEND AND LOST TO SIGHT AB DRIFTED TO THE TURN AND SAW BELOW
3079-164971-0045 WHAT SHE WOULD TELL THEM HE DID NOT KNOW THAT WAS NOT A MATTER TO BE MUCH CONSIDERED THERE WAS BUT ONE THING TO BE DONE
3079-164971-0046 AB SWAM NOW WITH A SOMEWHAT TIRED AND LANGUID STROKE TO THE SHORE WHERE OAK AWAITED HIM HILARIOUSLY THEY ALMOST CAME TO BLOWS THAT AFTERNOON AND BLOWS BETWEEN SUCH AS THEY MIGHT HAVE EASILY MEANT SUDDEN DEATH
3079-164971-0047 BUT THEY WERE NOT RIVALS YET AND THERE WAS MUCH TO TALK OF GOOD NATUREDLY AFTER SOME SLIGHT OUTFLAMINGS OF PASSION ON THE PART OF AB
3079-164971-0048 THE SUM OF ALL THE DAY WAS THAT THERE HAD BEEN MUCH EXERCISE AND FUN FOR OAK AT LEAST
3079-164971-0049 HAD HE CAUGHT HER AND TALKED WITH HER UPON THE RIVER BANK
