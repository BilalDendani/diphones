4563-26447-0000 THUS FAR YOU KNOW LITTLE OR NOTHING ABOUT ME MISTER DEXTER I SAID YOU ARE AS I BELIEVE QUITE UNAWARE THAT MY HUSBAND AND I ARE NOT LIVING TOGETHER AT THE PRESENT TIME
4563-26447-0001 IS IT NECESSARY TO MENTION YOUR HUSBAND HE ASKED COLDLY WITHOUT LOOKING UP FROM HIS EMBROIDERY AND WITHOUT PAUSING IN HIS WORK IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY I ANSWERED I CAN EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU IN NO OTHER WAY
4563-26447-0002 HE BENT HIS HEAD AND SIGHED RESIGNEDLY YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE NOT LIVING TOGETHER AT THE PRESENT TIME HE RESUMED DOES THAT MEAN THAT EUSTACE HAS LEFT YOU HE HAS LEFT ME AND HAS GONE ABROAD WITHOUT ANY NECESSITY FOR IT
4563-26447-0003 WITHOUT THE LEAST NECESSITY HAS HE APPOINTED NO TIME FOR HIS RETURN TO YOU IF HE PERSEVERE IN HIS PRESENT RESOLUTION MISTER DEXTER EUSTACE WILL NEVER RETURN TO ME
4563-26447-0004 FOR THE FIRST TIME HE RAISED HIS HEAD FROM HIS EMBROIDERY WITH A SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF INTEREST IS THE QUARREL SO SERIOUS AS THAT HE ASKED ARE YOU FREE OF EACH OTHER PRETTY MISSUS VALERIA BY COMMON CONSENT OF BOTH PARTIES
4563-26447-0005 THE TONE IN WHICH HE PUT THE QUESTION WAS NOT AT ALL TO MY LIKING THE LOOK HE FIXED ON ME WAS A LOOK WHICH UNPLEASANTLY SUGGESTED THAT I HAD TRUSTED MYSELF ALONE WITH HIM AND THAT HE MIGHT END IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT
4563-26447-0006 I REMINDED HIM QUIETLY BY MY MANNER MORE THAN BY MY WORDS OF THE RESPECT WHICH HE OWED TO ME YOU ARE ENTIRELY MISTAKEN I SAID THERE IS NO ANGER THERE IS NOT EVEN A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US
4563-26447-0007 OUR PARTING HAS COST BITTER SORROW MISTER DEXTER TO HIM AND TO ME HE SUBMITTED TO BE SET RIGHT WITH IRONICAL RESIGNATION I AM ALL ATTENTION HE SAID THREADING HIS NEEDLE PRAY GO ON I WON'T INTERRUPT YOU AGAIN
4563-26447-0008 ACTING ON THIS INVITATION I TOLD HIM THE TRUTH ABOUT MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF QUITE UNRESERVEDLY TAKING CARE HOWEVER AT THE SAME TIME TO PUT EUSTACE'S MOTIVES IN THE BEST LIGHT THAT THEY WOULD BEAR
4563-26447-0009 MISERRIMUS DEXTER DROPPED HIS EMBROIDERY ON HIS LAP AND LAUGHED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF WITH AN IMPISH ENJOYMENT OF MY POOR LITTLE NARRATIVE WHICH SET EVERY NERVE IN ME ON EDGE AS I LOOKED AT HIM I SEE NOTHING TO LAUGH AT I SAID SHARPLY
4563-26447-0010 HIS BEAUTIFUL BLUE EYES RESTED ON ME WITH A LOOK OF INNOCENT SURPRISE NOTHING TO LAUGH AT HE REPEATED IN SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF HUMAN FOLLY AS YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED HIS EXPRESSION SUDDENLY CHANGED HIS FACE DARKENED AND HARDENED VERY STRANGELY
4563-26447-0011 STOP HE CRIED BEFORE I COULD ANSWER HIM THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE REASON FOR YOU'RE TAKING IT AS SERIOUSLY AS YOU DO MISSUS VALERIA YOU ARE FOND OF YOUR HUSBAND FOND OF HIM ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO EXPRESS IT I RETORTED
4563-26447-0012 I LOVE HIM WITH MY WHOLE HEART
4563-26447-0013 YOU LOVE HIM WITH YOUR WHOLE HEART DO YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP IT I ANSWERED DOGGEDLY HE SMILED SATIRICALLY AND WENT ON WITH HIS EMBROIDERY CURIOUS HE SAID TO HIMSELF EUSTACE'S FIRST WIFE LOVED HIM TOO
4563-26447-0014 THERE ARE SOME MEN WHOM THE WOMEN ALL LIKE AND THERE ARE OTHER MEN WHOM THE WOMEN NEVER CARE FOR WITHOUT THE LEAST REASON FOR IT IN EITHER CASE THE ONE MAN IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE OTHER JUST AS HANDSOME AS AGREEABLE AS HONORABLE AND AS HIGH IN RANK AS THE OTHER
4563-26447-0015 AND YET FOR NUMBER ONE THEY WILL GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER AND FOR NUMBER TWO THEY WON'T SO MUCH AS TURN THEIR HEADS TO LOOK AT HIM WHY THEY DON'T KNOW THEMSELVES AS MISSUS VALERIA HAS JUST SAID IS THERE A PHYSICAL REASON FOR IT
4563-26447-0016 IS THERE SOME POTENT MAGNETIC EMANATION FROM NUMBER ONE WHICH NUMBER TWO DOESN'T POSSESS I MUST INVESTIGATE THIS WHEN I HAVE THE TIME AND WHEN I FIND MYSELF IN THE HUMOR HAVING SO FAR SETTLED THE QUESTION TO HIS OWN ENTIRE SATISFACTION HE LOOKED UP AT ME AGAIN
4563-26447-0017 I AM STILL IN THE DARK ABOUT YOU AND YOUR MOTIVES HE SAID I AM STILL AS FAR AS EVER FROM UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOUR INTEREST IS IN INVESTIGATING THAT HIDEOUS TRAGEDY AT GLENINCH CLEVER MISSUS VALERIA PLEASE TAKE ME BY THE HAND AND LEAD ME INTO THE LIGHT YOU'RE NOT OFFENDED WITH ME ARE YOU
4563-26447-0018 MAKE IT UP AND I WILL GIVE YOU THIS PRETTY PIECE OF EMBROIDERY WHEN I HAVE DONE IT I AM ONLY A POOR SOLITARY DEFORMED WRETCH WITH A QUAINT TURN OF MIND I MEAN NO HARM FORGIVE ME INDULGE ME ENLIGHTEN ME
4563-26447-0019 I BEGAN TO DOUBT WHETHER I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN UNREASONABLY HARD ON HIM I PENITENTLY RESOLVED TO BE MORE CONSIDERATE TOWARD HIS INFIRMITIES OF MIND AND BODY DURING THE REMAINDER OF MY VISIT LET ME GO BACK FOR A MOMENT MISTER DEXTER
4563-26447-0020 TO PAST TIMES AT GLENINCH I SAID YOU AGREE WITH ME IN BELIEVING EUSTACE TO BE ABSOLUTELY INNOCENT OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH HE WAS TRIED YOUR EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL TELLS ME THAT
4563-26447-0021 HE PAUSED OVER HIS WORK AND LOOKED AT ME WITH A GRAVE AND STERN ATTENTION WHICH PRESENTED HIS FACE IN QUITE A NEW LIGHT THAT IS OUR OPINION I RESUMED BUT IT WAS NOT THE OPINION OF THE JURY THEIR VERDICT YOU REMEMBER WAS NOT PROVEN
4563-26447-0022 IN PLAIN ENGLISH THE JURY WHO TRIED MY HUSBAND DECLINED TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINION POSITIVELY AND PUBLICLY THAT HE WAS INNOCENT AM I RIGHT INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HE SUDDENLY PUT HIS EMBROIDERY BACK IN THE BASKET AND MOVED THE MACHINERY OF HIS CHAIR SO AS TO BRING IT CLOSE BY MINE
4563-26447-0023 WHO TOLD YOU THIS HE ASKED I FOUND IT FOR MYSELF IN A BOOK THUS FAR HIS FACE HAD EXPRESSED STEADY ATTENTION AND NO MORE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING DARKLY PASSING OVER HIM WHICH BETRAYED ITSELF TO MY MIND AS RISING DISTRUST
4563-26447-0024 LADIES ARE NOT GENERALLY IN THE HABIT OF TROUBLING THEIR HEADS ABOUT DRY QUESTIONS OF LAW HE SAID MISSUS EUSTACE MACALLAN THE SECOND YOU MUST HAVE SOME VERY POWERFUL MOTIVE FOR TURNING YOUR STUDIES THAT WAY I HAVE A VERY POWERFUL MOTIVE MISTER DEXTER
4563-26447-0025 MY HUSBAND IS RESIGNED TO THE SCOTCH VERDICT HIS MOTHER IS RESIGNED TO IT HIS FRIENDS SO FAR AS I KNOW ARE RESIGNED TO IT WELL WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH MY HUSBAND OR HIS MOTHER OR HIS FRIENDS I REFUSE TO SUBMIT TO THE SCOTCH VERDICT
4563-26447-0026 HE SUDDENLY STRETCHED HIMSELF OVER HIS CHAIR HE POUNCED ON ME WITH A HAND ON EACH OF MY SHOULDERS HIS WILD EYES QUESTIONED ME FIERCELY FRANTICALLY WITHIN A FEW INCHES OF MY FACE
4563-26447-0027 WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SHOUTED AT THE UTMOST PITCH OF HIS RINGING AND RESONANT VOICE A DEADLY FEAR OF HIM SHOOK ME I DID MY BEST TO HIDE THE OUTWARD BETRAYAL OF IT
4563-26447-0028 REMOVE YOUR HANDS SIR I SAID AND RETIRE TO YOUR PROPER PLACE HE OBEYED ME MECHANICALLY HE APOLOGIZED TO ME MECHANICALLY HIS WHOLE MIND WAS EVIDENTLY STILL FILLED WITH THE WORDS THAT I HAD SPOKEN TO HIM AND STILL BENT ON DISCOVERING WHAT THOSE WORDS MEANT
4563-26447-0029 I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID I HUMBLY BEG YOUR PARDON THE SUBJECT EXCITES ME FRIGHTENS ME MADDENS ME YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A DIFFICULTY I HAVE IN CONTROLLING MYSELF NEVER MIND DON'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY DON'T BE FRIGHTENED AT ME I AM SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF

4563-26447-0031 DEAR MISSUS VALERIA INJURED MISSUS VALERIA I'LL ENDURE ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF PUNISHMENT IF YOU WILL ONLY TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY NOT SUBMITTING TO THE SCOTCH VERDICT HE BACKED HIS CHAIR PENITENTLY AS HE MADE THAT ENTREATY
4563-26447-0032 I'LL DROP OUT OF SIGHT IF YOU PREFER IT IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CHAIR HE LIFTED THE SEA GREEN COVERLET IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED LIKE A PUPPET IN A SHOW IF I HAD NOT STOPPED HIM SAY NOTHING MORE AND DO NOTHING MORE I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGIES I SAID
4563-26447-0033 WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I REFUSE TO SUBMIT TO THE OPINION OF THE SCOTCH JURY I MEAN EXACTLY WHAT MY WORDS EXPRESS THAT VERDICT HAS LEFT A STAIN ON MY HUSBAND'S CHARACTER HE FEELS THE STAIN BITTERLY HOW BITTERLY NO ONE KNOWS SO WELL AS I DO
4563-26447-0034 HIS SENSE OF HIS DEGRADATION IS THE SENSE THAT HAS PARTED HIM FROM ME IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR HIM THAT I AM PERSUADED OF HIS INNOCENCE
4563-26447-0035 NOTHING WILL BRING HIM BACK TO ME NOTHING WILL PERSUADE EUSTACE THAT I THINK HIM WORTHY TO BE THE GUIDE AND COMPANION OF MY LIFE BUT THE PROOF OF HIS INNOCENCE SET BEFORE THE JURY WHICH DOUBTS IT AND THE PUBLIC WHICH DOUBTS IT TO THIS DAY
4563-26447-0036 HE AND HIS FRIENDS AND HIS LAWYERS ALL DESPAIR OF EVER FINDING THAT PROOF NOW BUT I AM HIS WIFE AND NONE OF YOU LOVE HIM AS I LOVE HIM I ALONE REFUSE TO DESPAIR I ALONE REFUSE TO LISTEN TO REASON
4563-26447-0037 IF GOD SPARE ME MISTER DEXTER I DEDICATE MY LIFE TO THE VINDICATION OF MY HUSBAND'S INNOCENCE YOU ARE HIS OLD FRIEND I AM HERE TO ASK YOU TO HELP ME IT APPEARED TO BE NOW MY TURN TO FRIGHTEN HIM THE COLOR LEFT HIS FACE
4563-26447-0038 HE PASSED HIS HAND RESTLESSLY OVER HIS FOREHEAD AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO BRUSH SOME DELUSION OUT OF HIS BRAIN IS THIS ONE OF MY DREAMS HE ASKED FAINTLY ARE YOU A VISION OF THE NIGHT I AM ONLY A FRIENDLESS WOMAN I SAID
4563-26447-0039 WHO HAS LOST ALL THAT SHE LOVED AND PRIZED AND WHO IS TRYING TO WIN IT BACK AGAIN HE BEGAN TO MOVE HIS CHAIR NEARER TO ME ONCE MORE I LIFTED MY HAND HE STOPPED THE CHAIR DIRECTLY THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE WE SAT WATCHING ONE ANOTHER
4563-26447-0040 I SAW HIS HANDS TREMBLE AS HE LAID THEM ON THE COVERLET I SAW HIS FACE GROW PALER AND PALER AND HIS UNDER LIP DROP WHAT DEAD AND BURIED REMEMBRANCES HAD I BROUGHT TO LIFE IN HIM IN ALL THEIR OLDEN HORROR HE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK AGAIN
4563-26447-0041 SO THIS IS YOUR INTEREST HE SAID IN CLEARING UP THE MYSTERY OF MISSUS EUSTACE MACALLAN'S DEATH YES AND YOU BELIEVE THAT I CAN HELP YOU I DO HE SLOWLY LIFTED ONE OF HIS HANDS AND POINTED AT ME WITH HIS LONG FOREFINGER
4563-26447-0042 YOU SUSPECT SOMEBODY HE SAID THE TONE IN WHICH HE SPOKE WAS LOW AND THREATENING IT WARNED ME TO BE CAREFUL
4563-26447-0043 AT THE SAME TIME IF I NOW SHUT HIM OUT OF MY CONFIDENCE I SHOULD LOSE THE REWARD THAT MIGHT YET BE TO COME FOR ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED AND RISKED AT THAT PERILOUS INTERVIEW YOU SUSPECT SOMEBODY HE REPEATED PERHAPS WAS ALL THAT I SAID IN RETURN
4563-26447-0044 IS THE PERSON WITHIN YOUR REACH NOT YET DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE PERSON IS NO HE LAID HIS HEAD LANGUIDLY ON THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR WITH A TREMBLING LONG DRAWN SIGH
4563-26447-0045 WAS HE DISAPPOINTED OR WAS HE RELIEVED OR WAS HE SIMPLY EXHAUSTED IN MIND AND BODY ALIKE WHO COULD FATHOM HIM WHO COULD SAY WILL YOU GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES HE ASKED FEEBLY AND WEARILY WITHOUT RAISING HIS HEAD
