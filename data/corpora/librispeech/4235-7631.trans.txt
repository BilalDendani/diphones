4235-7631-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN AN ENEMY IN THE DARK ADAM SALTON WENT FOR A WALK BEFORE RETURNING TO LESSER HILL HE FELT THAT IT MIGHT BE WELL NOT ONLY TO STEADY HIS NERVES SHAKEN BY THE HORRIBLE SCENE BUT TO GET HIS THOUGHTS INTO SOME SORT OF ORDER
4235-7631-0001 SO AS TO BE READY TO ENTER ON THE MATTER WITH SIR NATHANIEL HE WAS A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AS TO TELLING HIS UNCLE FOR AFFAIRS HAD SO VASTLY PROGRESSED BEYOND HIS ORIGINAL VIEW THAT HE FELT A LITTLE DOUBTFUL AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S ATTITUDE WHEN HE SHOULD HEAR OF THE STRANGE EVENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME
4235-7631-0002 MISTER SALTON WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE SATISFIED AT BEING TREATED AS AN OUTSIDER WITH REGARD TO SUCH THINGS MOST OF WHICH HAD POINTS OF CONTACT WITH THE INMATES OF HIS OWN HOUSE
4235-7631-0003 THAT HE WAS DETAINED BY BUSINESS AT WALSALL WHERE HE WOULD REMAIN FOR THE NIGHT AND THAT HE WOULD BE BACK IN THE MORNING IN TIME FOR LUNCH WHEN ADAM GOT HOME AFTER HIS WALK HE FOUND SIR NATHANIEL JUST GOING TO BED
4235-7631-0004 HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING TO HIM THEN OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ARRANGING THAT THEY WOULD WALK TOGETHER IN THE EARLY MORNING AS HE HAD MUCH TO SAY THAT WOULD REQUIRE SERIOUS ATTENTION
4235-7631-0005 STRANGELY ENOUGH HE SLEPT WELL AND AWOKE AT DAWN WITH HIS MIND CLEAR AND HIS NERVES IN THEIR USUAL UNSHAKEN CONDITION THE MAID BROUGHT UP WITH HIS EARLY MORNING CUP OF TEA A NOTE WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE LETTER BOX
4235-7631-0006 I CANNOT GO TO BED UNTIL I HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU
4235-7631-0007 INDEED YOU MUST ALSO FORGIVE ME IF IN TRYING TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT I ERR IN SAYING TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE THE FACT IS THAT I AM QUITE UPSET AND UNNERVED BY ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS TERRIBLE NIGHT I FIND IT DIFFICULT EVEN TO WRITE
4235-7631-0008 MY HANDS SHAKE SO THAT THEY ARE NOT UNDER CONTROL AND I AM TREMBLING ALL OVER WITH MEMORY OF THE HORRORS WE SAW ENACTED BEFORE OUR EYES I AM GRIEVED BEYOND MEASURE THAT I SHOULD BE HOWEVER REMOTELY A CAUSE OF THIS HORROR COMING ON YOU
4235-7631-0009 FORGIVE ME IF YOU CAN AND DO NOT THINK TOO HARDLY OF ME THIS I ASK WITH CONFIDENCE FOR SINCE WE SHARED TOGETHER THE DANGER THE VERY PANGS OF DEATH I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BE TO ONE ANOTHER SOMETHING MORE THAN MERE FRIENDS
4235-7631-0010 THAT I MAY LEAN ON YOU AND TRUST YOU ASSURED THAT YOUR SYMPATHY AND PITY ARE FOR ME YOU REALLY MUST LET ME THANK YOU FOR THE FRIENDLINESS THE HELP THE CONFIDENCE THE REAL AID AT A TIME OF DEADLY DANGER AND DEADLY FEAR WHICH YOU SHOWED ME THAT AWFUL MAN
4235-7631-0011 I SHALL SEE HIM FOR EVER IN MY DREAMS HIS BLACK MALIGNANT FACE WILL SHUT OUT ALL MEMORY OF SUNSHINE AND HAPPINESS I SHALL ETERNALLY SEE HIS EVIL EYES AS HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THAT WELL HOLE IN A VAIN EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN MISDOING
4235-7631-0012 THE MORE I THINK OF IT THE MORE APPARENT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE HAD PREMEDITATED THE WHOLE THING OF COURSE EXCEPT HIS OWN HORRIBLE DEATH PERHAPS YOU HAVE NOTICED A FUR COLLAR I OCCASIONALLY WEAR IT IS ONE OF MY MOST VALUED TREASURES
4235-7631-0013 AN ERMINE COLLAR STUDDED WITH EMERALDS I HAD OFTEN SEEN THE NIGGER'S EYES GLEAM COVETOUSLY WHEN HE LOOKED AT IT UNHAPPILY I WORE IT YESTERDAY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE THAT LURED THE POOR MAN TO HIS DOOM ON THE VERY BRINK OF THE ABYSS HE TORE THE COLLAR FROM MY NECK
4235-7631-0014 THAT WAS THE LAST I SAW OF HIM WHEN HE SANK INTO THE HOLE I WAS RUSHING TO THE IRON DOOR WHICH I PULLED BEHIND ME
4235-7631-0015 WHEN I TORE MYSELF OUT OF THE NEGRO'S GRASP AS HE SANK INTO THE WELL HOLE I REALISED WHAT FREEDOM MEANT FREEDOM FREEDOM NOT ONLY FROM THAT NOISOME PRISON HOUSE WHICH HAS NOW SUCH A MEMORY
4235-7631-0016 WHILST I LIVE I SHALL ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR MY FREEDOM A WOMAN MUST SOMETIMES EXPRESS HER GRATITUDE OTHERWISE IT BECOMES TOO GREAT TO BEAR I AM NOT A SENTIMENTAL GIRL WHO MERELY LIKES TO THANK A MAN I AM A WOMAN WHO KNOWS ALL OF BAD AS WELL AS GOOD
4235-7631-0017 THAT LIFE CAN GIVE I HAVE KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO LOVE AND TO LOSE BUT YOU MUST NOT LET ME BRING ANY UNHAPPINESS INTO YOUR LIFE I MUST LIVE ON AS I HAVE LIVED ALONE AND IN ADDITION
4235-7631-0018 BEAR WITH OTHER WOES THE MEMORY OF THIS LATEST INSULT AND HORROR IN THE MEANTIME I MUST GET AWAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FROM DIANA'S GROVE IN THE MORNING I SHALL GO UP TO TOWN WHERE I SHALL REMAIN FOR A WEEK I CANNOT STAY LONGER AS BUSINESS AFFAIRS DEMAND MY PRESENCE HERE
4235-7631-0019 WILL HELP TO SOFTEN I CANNOT EXPECT TOTAL OBLITERATION THE TERRIBLE IMAGES OF THE BYGONE NIGHT WHEN I CAN SLEEP EASILY WHICH WILL BE I HOPE AFTER A DAY OR TWO I SHALL BE FIT TO RETURN HOME AND TAKE UP AGAIN THE BURDEN WHICH WILL I SUPPOSE

4235-7631-0021 IN THAT BUSY SPOT WE MAY FORGET SOME OF THE DANGERS AND HORRORS WE HAVE SHARED TOGETHER ADIEU AND THANK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR KINDNESS AND CONSIDERATION TO ME ARABELLA MARSH ADAM WAS SURPRISED BY THIS EFFUSIVE EPISTLE
4235-7631-0022 BUT HE DETERMINED TO SAY NOTHING OF IT TO SIR NATHANIEL UNTIL HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WELL OVER
4235-7631-0023 THE RESULT HAD BEEN THAT NOT ONLY WAS HE FAMILIAR WITH THE FACTS IN ALL THEIR BEARINGS BUT HE HAD ALREADY SO FAR DIFFERENTIATED THEM THAT HE WAS ABLE TO ARRANGE THEM IN HIS OWN MIND ACCORDING TO THEIR VALUES
4235-7631-0024 SO SOON AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED SIR NATHANIEL BEGAN
4235-7631-0025 ACCORDINGLY ADAM GAVE HIM DETAILS OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE PREVIOUS EVENING
4235-7631-0026 OR ANY OPINION OF THE MEANING OF THINGS WHICH HE DID NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND
4235-7631-0027 BUT SHORTLY GAVE THIS UP WHEN HE RECOGNISED THAT THE NARRATION WAS CONCISE AND SELF EXPLANATORY THENCEFORTH HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH QUICK LOOKS AND GLANCES EASILY INTERPRETED OR BY SOME ACQUIESCENT MOTIONS OF HIS HANDS WHEN SUCH COULD BE CONVENIENT
4235-7631-0028 TO EMPHASISE HIS IDEA OF THE CORRECTNESS OF ANY INFERENCE
4235-7631-0029 THE ELDER MAN MADE NO COMMENT WHATEVER EVEN WHEN ADAM TOOK FROM HIS POCKET LADY ARABELLA'S LETTER WITH THE MANIFEST INTENTION OF READING IT HE DID NOT MAKE ANY COMMENT FINALLY WHEN ADAM FOLDED UP THE LETTER AND PUT IT
4235-7631-0030 FOR A BEGINNING THEN LET ME SAY THAT LADY ARABELLA'S LETTER MAKES CLEAR SOME THINGS WHICH SHE INTENDED AND ALSO SOME THINGS WHICH SHE DID NOT INTEND BUT BEFORE I BEGIN TO DRAW DEDUCTIONS LET ME ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ADAM
