238-122530-0000 AFTER WHICH THE DUCHESS EXPLAINS VELMA'S LARYNGITIS LET US HOPE SHE WILL NOT CALL IT APPENDICITIS' AND THEN I USHER YOU UP ARE YOU READY
238-122530-0001 HAD SOUGHT JANE CHAMPION ON THE TERRACE AND STOOD BEFORE HER IN THE SOFT LIGHT OF THE HANGING CHINESE LANTERNS THE CRIMSON RAMBLER IN HIS BUTTON HOLE AND HIS RED SILK SOCKS WHICH MATCHED IT LENT AN ARTISTIC TOUCH OF COLOUR TO THE CONVENTIONAL BLACK AND WHITE OF HIS EVENING CLOTHES
238-122530-0002 JANE LOOKED UP FROM THE COMFORTABLE DEPTHS OF HER WICKER CHAIR THEN SMILED AT HIS ANXIOUS FACE I AM READY SHE SAID AND RISING WALKED BESIDE HIM HAS IT GONE WELL SHE ASKED IS IT A GOOD AUDIENCE PACKED REPLIED GARTH
238-122530-0003 AND THE DUCHESS HAS ENJOYED HERSELF IT HAS BEEN FUNNIER THAN USUAL
238-122530-0004 IT OBVIATES THE BOTHER OF TURNING OVER THEY PASSED INTO THE CONCERT ROOM AND STOOD BEHIND SCREENS AND A CURTAIN CLOSE TO THE HALF DOZEN STEPS LEADING FROM THE SIDE UP ON TO THE PLATFORM OH HARK TO THE DUCHESS WHISPERED GARTH
238-122530-0005 MY NIECE JANE CHAMPION HAS KINDLY CONSENTED TO STEP INTO THE BREACH WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO STEP UP ON TO THAT PLATFORM IN ANOTHER HALF MINUTE
238-122530-0006 THERE APPENDICITIS I TOLD YOU SO POOR MADAME VELMA LET US HOPE IT WON'T GET INTO THE LOCAL PAPERS OH GOODNESS
238-122530-0007 I SAY MISS CHAMPION I WAS CHAFFING THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT SHARPS AND FLATS I CAN PLAY THAT ACCOMPANIMENT FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE NO WELL JUST AS YOU THINK BEST
238-122530-0008 NOW THE DUCHESS HAS DONE COME ON MIND THE BOTTOM STEP HANG IT ALL HOW DARK IT IS BEHIND THIS CURTAIN GARTH GAVE HER HIS HAND AND JANE MOUNTED THE STEPS AND PASSED INTO VIEW OF THE LARGE AUDIENCE ASSEMBLED IN THE OVERDENE CONCERT ROOM
238-122530-0009 HER TALL FIGURE SEEMED TALLER THAN USUAL AS SHE WALKED ALONE ACROSS THE RATHER HIGH PLATFORM
238-122530-0010 WITH OLD LACE AT HER BOSOM AND ONE STRING OF PEARLS ROUND HER NECK WHEN SHE APPEARED THE AUDIENCE GAZED AT HER AND APPLAUDED DOUBTFULLY VELMA'S NAME ON THE PROGRAMME HAD RAISED GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND HERE WAS MISS CHAMPION WHO CERTAINLY PLAYED VERY NICELY
238-122530-0011 VOLUNTEERING TO SING VELMA'S SONG
238-122530-0012 VOICING ITS GENEROUS APPRECIATION OF HER EFFORT AND SANGUINE EXPECTATION OF HER SUCCESS THIS AUDIENCE EXPRESSED ITS ASTONISHMENT IN THE DUBIOUSNESS OF ITS FAINT APPLAUSE JANE SMILED AT THEM GOOD NATUREDLY SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO
238-122530-0013 A BECHSTEIN GRAND GLANCED AT THE FESTOONS OF WHITE ROSES AND THE CROSS OF CRIMSON RAMBLERS THEN WITHOUT FURTHER PRELIMINARIES STRUCK THE OPENING CHORD AND COMMENCED TO SING THE DEEP PERFECT VOICE THRILLED THROUGH THE ROOM
238-122530-0014 A SUDDEN BREATHLESS HUSH FELL UPON THE AUDIENCE EACH SYLLABLE PENETRATED THE SILENCE BORNE ON A TONE SO TENDER AND SO AMAZINGLY SWEET THAT CASUAL HEARTS STOOD STILL AND MARVELLED AT THEIR OWN EMOTION
238-122530-0015 AND THOSE WHO FELT DEEPLY ALREADY RESPONDED WITH A YET DEEPER THRILL TO THE MAGIC OF THAT MUSIC THE HOURS I SPENT WITH THEE DEAR HEART ARE AS A STRING OF PEARLS TO ME I COUNT THEM OVER EV'RY ONE APART MY ROSARY
238-122530-0016 MY ROSARY SOFTLY THOUGHTFULLY TENDERLY THE LAST TWO WORDS WERE BREATHED INTO THE SILENCE HOLDING A WORLD OF REMINISCENCE A LARGE HEARTED WOMAN'S FAITHFUL REMEMBRANCE OF TENDER MOMENTS IN THE PAST
238-122530-0017 THE LISTENING CROWD HELD ITS BREATH THIS WAS NOT A SONG THIS WAS THE THROBBING OF A HEART AND IT THROBBED IN TONES OF SUCH SWEETNESS THAT TEARS STARTED UNBIDDEN THEN THE VOICE WHICH HAD RENDERED THE OPENING LINES SO QUIETLY
238-122530-0018 ROSE IN A RAPID CRESCENDO OF QUIVERING PAIN EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL A PRAYER TO STILL A HEART IN ABSENCE WRUNG I TELL EACH BEAD UNTO THE END AND THERE A CROSS IS HUNG
238-122530-0019 THE LAST FOUR WORDS WERE GIVEN WITH A SUDDEN POWER AND PASSION
238-122530-0020 BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE QUIET VOICE FELL SOOTHINGLY EXPRESSING A STRENGTH OF ENDURANCE WHICH WOULD FAIL IN NO CRISIS NOR FEAR TO FACE ANY DEPTHS OF PAIN YET GATHERING TO ITSELF A POIGNANCY OF SWEETNESS
238-122530-0021 RENDERED RICHER BY THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING O MEMORIES THAT BLESS AND BURN O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS
238-122530-0022 CAN POSSIBLY REALISE HOW SHE SANG I KISS EACH BEAD THE LINGERING RETROSPECTION IN EACH WORD BREATHED OUT A LOVE SO WOMANLY SO BEAUTIFUL SO TENDER THAT HER IDENTITY WAS FORGOTTEN EVEN BY THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO KNEW HER BEST
238-122530-0023 IN THE MAGIC OF HER RENDERING OF THE SONG THE ACCOMPANIMENT WHICH OPENS WITH A SINGLE CHORD CLOSES WITH A SINGLE NOTE JANE STRUCK IT SOFTLY LINGERINGLY THEN ROSE TURNED FROM THE PIANO
238-122530-0024 AND WAS LEAVING THE PLATFORM WHEN A SUDDEN BURST OF WILD APPLAUSE BROKE FROM THE AUDIENCE JANE HESITATED PAUSED LOOKED AT HER AUNT'S GUESTS AS IF ALMOST SURPRISED TO FIND THEM THERE THEN THE SLOW SMILE DAWNED IN HER EYES AND PASSED TO HER LIPS
238-122530-0025 THEN MOVED ON AS MEN'S VOICES BEGAN TO SHOUT ENCORE
238-122530-0026 LEFT THE PLATFORM BY THE SIDE STAIRCASE BUT THERE BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE SEMI DARKNESS OF SCREENS AND CURTAINS A FRESH SURPRISE AWAITED JANE MORE STARTLING THAN THE ENTHUSIASTIC TUMULT OF HER AUDIENCE
238-122530-0027 AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE STOOD GARTH DALMAIN HIS FACE WAS ABSOLUTELY COLOURLESS AND HIS EYES SHONE OUT FROM IT LIKE BURNING STARS HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS UNTIL SHE STEPPED FROM THE LAST STAIR AND STOOD CLOSE TO HIM THEN WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT
238-122530-0028 HE CAUGHT HER BY THE SHOULDERS AND TURNED HER ROUND GO BACK HE SAID AND THE OVERMASTERING NEED QUIVERING IN HIS VOICE DREW JANE'S EYES TO HIS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT GO BACK AT ONCE AND SING IT ALL OVER AGAIN NOTE FOR NOTE WORD FOR WORD
238-122530-0029 GO BACK AT ONCE DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YOU MUST JANE LOOKED INTO THOSE SHINING EYES SOMETHING SHE SAW IN THEM EXCUSED THE BRUSQUE COMMAND OF HIS TONE
238-122530-0030 WITHOUT A WORD SHE QUIETLY MOUNTED THE STEPS AND WALKED ACROSS THE PLATFORM TO THE PIANO PEOPLE WERE STILL APPLAUDING AND REDOUBLED THEIR DEMONSTRATIONS OF DELIGHT AS SHE APPEARED BUT JANE TOOK HER SEAT AT THE INSTRUMENT WITHOUT GIVING THEM A THOUGHT
238-122530-0031 SHE WAS EXPERIENCING A VERY CURIOUS AND UNUSUAL SENSATION NEVER BEFORE IN HER WHOLE LIFE HAD SHE OBEYED A PEREMPTORY COMMAND IN HER CHILDHOOD'S DAYS
238-122530-0032 AN UNREASONABLE ORDER OR A REASONABLE ONE UNEXPLAINED PROMPTLY MET WITH A POINT BLANK REFUSAL AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC STILL OBTAINED THOUGH MODIFIED BY TIME AND EVEN THE DUCHESS AS A RULE SAID PLEASE TO JANE
238-122530-0033 BUT NOW A YOUNG MAN WITH A WHITE FACE AND BLAZING EYES HAD UNCEREMONIOUSLY SWUNG HER ROUND ORDERED HER UP THE STAIRS AND COMMANDED HER TO SING A SONG OVER AGAIN NOTE FOR NOTE WORD FOR WORD AND SHE WAS MEEKLY GOING TO OBEY
238-122530-0034 AS SHE TOOK HER SEAT JANE SUDDENLY MADE UP HER MIND NOT TO SING THE ROSARY AGAIN SHE HAD MANY FINER SONGS IN HER REPERTOIRE THE AUDIENCE EXPECTED ANOTHER WHY SHOULD SHE DISAPPOINT THOSE EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE OF THE IMPERIOUS DEMANDS OF
238-122530-0035 A VERY HIGHLY EXCITED BOY SHE COMMENCED THE MAGNIFICENT PRELUDE TO HANDEL'S WHERE'ER YOU WALK BUT AS SHE PLAYED IT HER SENSE OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE INTERVENED SHE HAD NOT COME BACK TO SING AGAIN AT THE BIDDING OF A HIGHLY EXCITED BOY
238-122530-0036 BUT OF A DEEPLY MOVED MAN AND HIS EMOTION WAS OF NO ORDINARY KIND THAT GARTH DALMAIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO MOVED AS TO FORGET EVEN MOMENTARILY
238-122530-0037 WHILE SHE PLAYED THE HANDEL THEME
238-122530-0038 SHE SUDDENLY REALISED THOUGH SCARCELY UNDERSTANDING IT THE MUST OF WHICH GARTH HAD SPOKEN AND MADE UP HER MIND TO YIELD TO ITS NECESSITY SO WHEN THE OPENING BARS WERE ENDED
238-122530-0039 SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT STRUCK ONCE MORE THE ROSARY'S OPENING CHORD AND DID AS GARTH HAD BIDDEN HER TO DO THE HOURS I SPENT WITH THEE DEAR HEART ARE AS A STRING OF PEARLS TO ME I COUNT THEM OVER EV'RY ONE APART
238-122530-0040 MY ROSARY MY ROSARY EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL A PRAYER TO STILL A HEART IN ABSENCE WRUNG I TELL EACH BEAD UNTO THE END AND THERE A CROSS IS HUNG O MEMORIES THAT BLESS AND BURN
238-122530-0041 O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS WHEN JANE LEFT THE PLATFORM GARTH WAS STILL STANDING MOTIONLESS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
238-122530-0042 HIS FACE WAS JUST AS WHITE AS BEFORE BUT HIS EYES HAD LOST THAT TERRIBLE LOOK OF UNSHED TEARS WHICH HAD SENT HER BACK AT HIS BIDDING WITHOUT A WORD OF QUESTION OR REMONSTRANCE A WONDERFUL LIGHT NOW SHONE IN THEM A LIGHT OF ADORATION WHICH TOUCHED JANE'S HEART
238-122530-0043 SHE SMILED AS SHE CAME SLOWLY DOWN THE STEPS
238-122530-0044 WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS MOVEMENT OF GRACIOUS FRIENDLINESS GARTH STEPPED CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AND TOOK THEM IN HIS WHILE SHE WAS STILL ON THE STEP ABOVE HIM FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT SPEAK THEN IN A LOW VOICE VIBRANT WITH EMOTION
238-122530-0045 MY GOD HE SAID OH MY GOD HUSH SAID JANE I NEVER LIKE TO HEAR THAT NAME SPOKEN LIGHTLY DAL SPOKEN LIGHTLY HE EXCLAIMED NO SPEAKING LIGHTLY WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO NIGHT
238-122530-0046 EVERY PERFECT GIFT IS FROM ABOVE WHEN WORDS FAIL ME TO SPEAK OF THE GIFT CAN YOU WONDER IF I APOSTROPHISE THE GIVER
238-122530-0047 SO YOU LIKED MY SONG SHE SAID LIKED
238-122530-0048 REPEATED GARTH A SHADE OF PERPLEXITY CROSSING HIS FACE I DO
238-122530-0049 BECAUSE SAID GARTH VERY LOW YOU LIFTED THE VEIL AND I I PASSED WITHIN
238-122530-0050 AND AS HE SPOKE THE LAST TWO WORDS HE TURNED THEM GENTLY OVER AND BENDING KISSED EACH PALM WITH AN INDESCRIBABLY TENDER REVERENCE THEN LOOSING THEM
