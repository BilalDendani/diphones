1593-94847-0000 THE COLLISION IN THE FOG HULLO
1593-94847-0001 REMARKED SAM AS THE SEASHELL DROPPED AT HIS FEET THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE OF THE SHELL SAID TOM A BIT OF PAPER PERHAPS IT'S A MESSAGE I'LL SOON SEE RETURNED HIS YOUNGER BROTHER
1593-94847-0002 AND RAN TO WHERE HE COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM THE OTHER YACHT HE PULLED FROM THE SEASHELL A SMALL SQUARE OF PAPER UPON WHICH HAD BEEN HASTILY SCRAWLED THE FOLLOWING IN LEAD PENCIL I WILL HELP YOU ALL
1593-94847-0003 I CAN AND HOPE YOU WON'T PROSECUTE ME I WILL SEE THAT DORA S GETS SOMETHING TO EAT EVEN IF I GIVE HER MY SHARE THEY INTEND TO GO TO SAND HAVEN IF THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE SLIP
1593-94847-0004 GOOD FOR MUMPS HE'S COMING TO HIS SENSES CRIED SAM AND SHOWED THE OTHERS THE MESSAGE DICK READ THE WORDS WITH MUCH SATISFACTION I HOPE HE DOES STAND BY DORA HE SAID
1593-94847-0005 IF HE TELLS THE TRUTH WE MAY AS WELL PUT INTO HARBOR AND MAKE FOR SAND HAVEN SAID MARTIN HARRIS WHO HAD NOW RESUMED THE CHASE ONCE MORE YES
1593-94847-0006 WAS SERGEANT BROWN'S COMMENT THE WHOLE THING MAY BE A TRICK TO GET US TO GO TO SAND HAVEN
1593-94847-0007 TO GIVE HER UP TO US WOULD HAVE BEEN NO HARDSHIP THAT'S IT PUT IN MARTIN HARRIS WELL
1593-94847-0008 THE MATTER WAS TALKED OVER AT SOME LENGTH AND IT WAS FINALLY DECIDED
1593-94847-0009 IF WHEN NIGHT CAME ON THE OTHER CRAFT SHOULD STEER IN THE DIRECTION OF SAND HAVEN THEY WOULD DO LIKEWISE
1593-94847-0010 SLOWLY THE DAY WORE ALONG AND THE TWO YACHTS KEPT AT ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE THEY WERE BOTH RUNNING DUE SOUTH AND LAND WAS OUT OF SIGHT AS BEFORE
1593-94847-0011 AND NO MISTAKE REMARKED TOM
1593-94847-0012 WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WHEN WE LEFT CEDARVILLE IN SUCH A HURRY I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW THINGS ARE GOING UP THERE MUSED DICK IT WILL BE TOO BAD IF JOSIAH CRABTREE SUCCEEDS IN MARRYING MISSUS STANHOPE WHILE WE ARE AWAY
1593-94847-0013 LET US HOPE FOR THE BEST PUT IN SAM
1593-94847-0014 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN HARRIS CRIED DICK IT MEANS THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE THE MOST OF THIS WIND RESPONDED THE SKIPPER OF THE YACHT GRIMLY
1593-94847-0015 YOU CAN'T DO IT ANY TOO QUICK ANSWERED DICK WHEN NEXT WE MEET THERE WON'T BE QUITE SO MUCH TALKING INSTEAD WE'LL HAVE SOME ACTING AND PRETTY LIVELY AT THAT SERGEANT BROWN WAS QUESTIONED CONCERNING HIS WEAPONS
1593-94847-0016 AND SAID HE HAD TWO PISTOLS AND CARTER HAD THE SAME ONE OF THE EXTRA WEAPONS WAS LOANED TO DICK AND THE SECOND WENT TO TOM IT WAS DECIDED
1593-94847-0017 ANYTHING THAT WAS HANDY BUT OTHERWISE THEY WERE TO ATTEND TO THE SAILING OF THE SEARCHLIGHT PROVISIONS TO USE TOM'S WAY OF EXPRESSING IT WERE NOW
1593-94847-0018 AND AS THEY ATE THE SCANT FOOD DEALT AROUND DICK COULD NOT HELP BUT THINK OF HOW DORA MIGHT BE FARING I'D WILLINGLY STARVE MYSELF IF ONLY IT WOULD GIVE HER WHAT SHE NEEDS HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM SICK AT HEART
1593-94847-0019 TO THINK OF HOW SHE MIGHT BE SUFFERING MILE AFTER MILE WAS PASSED UNTIL THE SUN BEGAN TO DESCEND OVER TO THE WESTWARD THE YACHTS WERE NOW CLOSE ON TO QUARTER OF A MILE APART
1593-94847-0020 HERE COMES ANOTHER STEAMER CRIED TOM PRESENTLY LOOK HERE WHY CAN'T WE GET SOME HELP FROM HER PERHAPS WE CAN BURST OUT DICK I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT LET US SIGNAL HER ANYWAY SUGGESTED SERGEANT BROWN
1593-94847-0021 A FLAG WAS RUN UP AS HIGH AS THE TOPMAST PERMITTED AND THEY HEADED DIRECTLY FOR THE STEAMER'S COURSE
1593-94847-0022 FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW LET ME STATE THAT A TRAMP STEAMER IS ONE GOING FROM ONE PORT TO ANOTHER REGARDLESS OF ANY REGULAR ROUTE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE CRAFT DEPENDING ENTIRELY UPON THE FREIGHT TO BE PICKED UP
1593-94847-0023 SHE SEES THE SIGNAL EXCLAIMED DICK AFTER AN ANXIOUS WAIT OF SEVERAL MINUTES SLOWLY THE STEAMER CAME UP TO THEM AND THEN HER PONDEROUS ENGINES CEASED TO WORK WHAT IS WANTED CAME IN SPANISH
1593-94847-0024 FROM A DARK LOOKING MAN ON THE FORWARD DECK CAN'T YOU TALK ENGLISH CRIED DICK A LEETLE WE ARE AFTER THAT OTHER SAIL BOAT
1593-94847-0025 WILL YOU HELP US CATCH THEM AT THIS THE MAN ON THE STEAMER DREW DOWN HIS FACE AND HELD A CONSULTATION WITH SEVERAL BEHIND HIM YOU ARE SURE THEY ARE THIEVES HE ASKED PRESENTLY YES
1593-94847-0026 WE ARE PRETTY CERTAIN THEY HAVE AND THE GIRL YES
1593-94847-0027 WELL I DECLARE BURST OUT TOM THEY ARE AFTER A REWARD THE FIRST THING NO REWARD YET ANSWERED DICK BUT THERE MAY BE AT THIS THE SOUTH AMERICAN SCOWLED
1593-94847-0028 WE CANNOT LOSE TIME ON A HUNT THAT IS WORTH NOTHING HE SAID WE MUST GET TO BROOKLYN BY TOMORROW MORNING YOU WON'T HELP US BRING THEM TO JUSTICE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THE TIME
1593-94847-0029 WITHOUT FURTHER WORDS THE BIG STEAMER'S ENGINES WERE STARTED UP AGAIN AND AWAY SHE SPED LEAVING THE SEARCHLIGHT TO SINK AND RISE ON THE ROLLERS LEFT IN HER WAKE
1593-94847-0030 GROANED DICK HE ISN'T DOING A SINGLE THING WITHOUT PAY WE MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT SOME PROVISIONS FROM HIM PUT IN MARTIN HARRIS
1593-94847-0031 I DON'T WANT HIS STUFF REMARKED SAM I'M AFRAID IT WOULD CHOKE ME IF I TRIED TO EAT IT THE STOP HAD GIVEN THE FLYAWAY AN ADVANTAGE
1593-94847-0032 BUT BEFORE THE GUN WENT DOWN THOSE ON THE OTHER YACHT SAW HER HEAD FOR THE COAST ONCE MORE I GUESS THE NOTE TOLD THE TRUTH SAID HARRIS IS SAND HAVEN NEAR HERE QUESTIONED TOM
1593-94847-0033 AND HOW FAR ARE WE OUT WAS THE POLICE SERGEANT'S QUESTION BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX MILES AS NEAR AS I CAN CALCULATE WILL THEY BE ABLE TO RUN IN BY DARK I THINK SO
1593-94847-0034 AND IT DEPENDS A GOOD BIT ON HOW MUCH IT VEERS AROUND CONCLUDED THE OLD SAILOR
1593-94847-0035 IT WAS GROWING CLOUDY AND A MIST WAS RISING THE MIST MADE MARTIN HARRIS SHAKE HIS HEAD BUT NOT WISHING TO ALARM THE OTHERS HE SAID NOTHING BUT SOON DICK NOTICED THE MIST AND SO DID THE REST
1593-94847-0036 GRACIOUS SUPPOSING WE GET CAUGHT IN A FOG MUTTERED TOM I WAS JUST THINKING OF IT RETURNED HIS ELDER BROTHER THERE WILL BE NO FUN IN IT IF WE ARE OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
1593-94847-0037 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WENT BY AND STILL NO LAND APPEARED IT WAS NOW SO RAW THAT THE BOYS WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO BUTTON THEIR COATS TIGHTLY ABOUT THEM THEN OF A SUDDEN
1593-94847-0038 AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO SEE A DOZEN YARDS IN ANY DIRECTION THIS IS THE WORST YET GROANED SAM WHAT'S TO DO NOW YES WHAT'S TO DO NOW REPEATED SERGEANT BROWN CAN YOU MAKE THE COAST SKIPPER
1593-94847-0039 TO BE SURE I CAN REPLIED HARRIS AS HE LOOKED AT THE COMPASS BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT LANDING
1593-94847-0040 PERHAPS THE FOG WILL LIFT SUGGESTED CARTER A FOG LIKE THIS ISN'T LIFTING IN A HURRY SAID DICK LIKE AS NOT IT WON'T MOVE UNTIL THE SUN COMES UP TOMORROW MORNING AND IN THIS GUESS HE WAS RIGHT
1593-94847-0041 A HALF HOUR WENT BY AND FROM A DISTANCE CAME THE DEEP NOTE OF A FOG HORN SOUNDING APPARENTLY FROM UP THE SHORE WE OUGHT TO HAVE A HORN SAID SAM SOME BIG BOAT MAY COME ALONG AND RUN US DOWN
1593-94847-0042 THERE IS A HORN IN THE CABIN PANTRY REPLIED MARTIN HARRIS WE MIGHT AS WELL BRING IT OUT IF WE ARE SUNK ONE OR MORE OF US WILL MOST LIKELY BE DROWNED
1593-94847-0043 I'LL GET THE HORN AND RUNNING BELOW HE BROUGHT IT UP AND HE AND SAM TOOK TURNS AT BLOWING IT WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF THEIR LUNGS ONE THING IS COMFORTING THOSE RASCALS ARE NO BETTER OFF THAN WE ARE
1593-94847-0044 WAS TOM'S COMMENT YES BUT IF THEY FOUNDER WHAT WILL BECOME OF DORA I DON'T BELIEVE ANY ONE OF THEM WOULD PUT HIMSELF OUT TO SAVE HER I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT THERE DICK
1593-94847-0045 I NEVER THOUGHT OF HER POOR GIRL REPLIED THE BROTHER DICK AND SERGEANT BROWN WERE WELL UP IN THE BOW ONE WATCHING TO STARBOARD AND THE OTHER TO PORT FOR ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT APPEAR THROUGH THE GLOOM
1593-94847-0046 THE HORN WAS BLOWING CONSTANTLY AND NOW FROM A DISTANCE CAME THE SOUNDS OF BOTH HORNS AND BELLS WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO SOME OTHER SHIPS SAID MARTIN HARRIS I RECKON WE HAD BEST TAKE A FEW REEFS IN THE MAINSAIL
1593-94847-0047 AND THESE SUGGESTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT THE MINUTES THAT FOLLOWED WERE ANXIOUS ONES FOR ALL FELT THAT A COLLISION MIGHT OCCUR AT ANY MOMENT THE FOG WAS GROWING THICKER EACH INSTANT AND THIS COUPLED WITH THE COMING OF NIGHT
1593-94847-0048 A BOAT IS DEAD AHEAD CAME SUDDENLY FROM DICK AND SERGEANT BROWN ALSO GAVE A CRY OF WARNING THEN CAME A SHOCK AND A CRASH AND A SPLINTERING OF WOOD FOLLOWED BY THE CRIES OF MEN AND BOYS AND THE SCREAMS OF A WOMAN AND A GIRL
1593-94847-0049 WE'VE STRUCK THE FLYAWAY CALLED OUT TOM
