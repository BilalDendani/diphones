960-125241-0000 IN THE EARLY SUMMER OF SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO WHEN WILLIAM RESOLVED TO CONCENTRATE ALL HIS AVAILABLE FORCES FOR THE DEFENCE OF HOLLAND COVERED BY ITS WATER LINE THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS APPARENTLY HOPELESS
960-125241-0001 HAD TURENNE AND LUXEMBURG MADE A UNITED EFFORT TO FORCE THIS LINE AT THE OPENING OF THE CAMPAIGN THE PROBABILITY IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED INSTEAD OF DOING SO THEY EXPENDED THEIR ENERGIES IN THE CAPTURE OF A NUMBER OF FORTIFIED PLACES IN GELDERLAND OVERYSSEL
960-125241-0002 AND NORTH BRABANT AND IN THE MEANTIME THE STADHOLDER WAS WEEK BY WEEK STRENGTHENING THE WEAK POINTS IN HIS DEFENCES ENCOURAGING HIS MEN PERSONALLY SUPERVISING EVERY DETAIL AND SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF UNSHAKEN COURAGE AND OF CEASELESS INDUSTRY
960-125241-0003 HE HAD AT HIS SIDE AS HIS FIELD MARSHAL GEORGE FREDERICK COUNT OF WALDECK AN OFFICER OF EXPERIENCE AND SKILL WHO HAD ENTERED THE REPUBLIC'S SERVICE
960-125241-0004 AFTER A SIEGE LASTING FROM JULY NINTH TO AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH HAD TO RETIRE FROM GRONINGEN THE FRENCH ARMIES WERE ALL THIS TIME BEING CONSTANTLY WEAKENED
960-125241-0005 BY HAVING TO PLACE GARRISONS IN THE CONQUERED PROVINCES AND NEITHER TURENNE NOR LUXEMBURG FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO ATTACK THE STRONGLY PROTECTED DUTCH FRONTIERS BEHIND THE WATER LINE THE PRINCE HOWEVER WAS NOT CONTENT WITH INACTION
960-125241-0006 ASSUMING THE OFFENSIVE HE VENTURED ON A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON NAARDEN AND ON WOERDEN RAISED THE SIEGE OF MAESTRICHT AND FINALLY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO CUT THE FRENCH COMMUNICATIONS BY A MARCH UPON CHARLEROI ALL THESE RAIDS
960-125241-0007 A HARD FROST IN DECEMBER ENABLED LUXEMBURG TO PENETRATE INTO HOLLAND BUT A RAPID THAW COMPELLED A HASTY WITHDRAWAL THE ONLY ROAD OPEN TO HIM WAS BLOCKED BY A FORTIFIED POST AT NIEUWERBRUG
960-125241-0008 THE COLONEL WAS TRIED ON THE CHARGE OF DESERTING HIS POST AND SHOT
960-125241-0009 ALARM AT THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE FRENCH POWER BROUGHT AT LAST BOTH SPANISH AND AUSTRIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE HARD PRESSED NETHERLANDS AND THE COURAGE AND SKILL OF DE RUYTER HELD SUCCESSFULLY AT BAY THE UNITED FLEETS OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE AND EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED THE LANDING OF AN ARMY ON THE DUTCH COAST
960-125241-0010 NEVER DID DE RUYTER EXHIBIT HIGHER QUALITIES OF LEADERSHIP THAN IN THE NAVAL CAMPAIGN OF SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE HIS FLEET WAS GREATLY INFERIOR IN NUMBERS TO THE COMBINED ANGLO FRENCH FLEET UNDER PRINCE RUPERT AND D'ESTREES
960-125241-0011 A STUBBORN ACTION TOOK PLACE NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE SCHELDT ON JUNE SEVENTH IN WHICH THE ENGLISH HAD LITTLE ASSISTANCE FROM THE FRENCH SQUADRON AND FINALLY RETIRED TO THE ESTUARY OF THE THAMES
960-125241-0012 ALL ATTEMPTS HOWEVER TO PASS THE WATER LINE AND ENTER HOLLAND MET WITH FAILURE AND AS THE SUMMER DREW TO ITS CLOSE THE ADVANCE OF IMPERIAL AND SPANISH FORCES BEGAN TO RENDER THE POSITION OF THE FRENCH PRECARIOUS
960-125241-0013 WILLIAM SEIZED HIS OPPORTUNITY IN SEPTEMBER TO CAPTURE NAARDEN BEFORE LUXEMBURG COULD ADVANCE TO ITS RELIEF HE THEN TOOK A BOLDER STEP IN OCTOBER AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN OF WHOM FIFTEEN THOUSAND WERE SPANISH HE MARCHED TO COLOGNE AND
960-125241-0014 AFTER EFFECTING A JUNCTION WITH THE IMPERIAL ARMY LAID SIEGE TO BONN WHICH SURRENDERED ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH THIS BRILLIANT STROKE HAD GREAT RESULTS THE FRENCH FEARING THAT THEIR COMMUNICATIONS MIGHT BE CUT
960-125241-0015 WITHDREW FROM THE DUTCH FRONTIER AND AT THE SAME TIME THE MUENSTER COLOGNE FORCES HASTILY EVACUATED THE EASTERN PROVINCES
960-125241-0016 THE STADHOLDER BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR ENTIRELY FREED THE COUNTRY FROM ITS INVADERS ONCE MORE A PRINCE OF ORANGE HAD SAVED THE DUTCH REPUBLIC IN ITS EXTREMITY THE EFFECT OF THIS WAS TO PLACE ALMOST SUPREME POWER IN HIS HANDS
960-125241-0017 HAD THE PRINCE AT THIS MOMENT SET HIS HEART UPON OBTAINING THE TITLE OF SOVEREIGN HE WOULD HAVE HAD BUT LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN GRATIFYING HIS AMBITION
960-125241-0018 THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MAN IN AMSTERDAM WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED HIM
960-125241-0019 LARGE TRACTS ON THE BORDERS OF HOLLAND UTRECHT AND FRIESLAND SUBMERGED BY THE SEA WATERS THROUGH THE CUTTING OF THE DAMS HAD BEEN RENDERED VALUELESS FOR SOME YEARS TO COME
960-125241-0020 WHILE THOSE PARTS OF HOLLAND AND ZEELAND ON WHICH THE ENEMY HAD NOT SET FOOT HAD BEEN CRUSHED BENEATH HEAVY TAXES AND THE LOSS OF COMMERCE THE POSITION OF THE THREE PROVINCES UTRECHT GELDERLAND AND OVERYSSEL WHICH HAD BEEN OVERRUN BY THE FRENCH AT THE OPENING OF HOSTILITIES AND HELD BY THEM EVER SINCE
960-125241-0021 HAD TO BE RE SETTLED THEY HAD DURING THIS PERIOD PAID NO TAXES AND HAD NO REPRESENTATION IN THE STATES GENERAL HOLLAND WAS IN FAVOUR OF REDUCING THEM TO THE STATUS OF GENERALITY LANDS UNTIL THEY HAD PAID THEIR ARREARS
960-125241-0022 THE PRINCE WAS OPPOSED TO ANY HARSHNESS OF TREATMENT AND HIS WILL PREVAILED THE THREE PROVINCES WERE RE ADMITTED INTO THE UNION BUT WITH SHORN PRIVILEGES AND WILLIAM WAS ELECTED STADHOLDER BY EACH OF THEM WITH LARGELY INCREASED POWERS
960-125241-0023 THE NOMINATION OR THE CHOICE OUT OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF NOMINEES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE TOWN CORPORATIONS OF THE COURTS OF JUSTICE AND OF THE DELEGATES TO THE STATES GENERAL WAS GRANTED TO HIM THE DUTCH REPUBLIC WAS FULL OF ANOMALIES
960-125241-0024 IN UTRECHT GELDERLAND AND OVERYSSEL WE HAVE THE CURIOUS SPECTACLE IN THE DAYS OF WILLIAM THE THIRD OF THE STADHOLDER WHO WAS NOMINALLY A SERVANT OF THE SOVEREIGN ESTATES HIMSELF APPOINTING HIS MASTERS AS A MATTER OF FACT THE VOICE OF THESE PROVINCES WAS HIS VOICE AND
960-125241-0025 AS HE LIKEWISE CONTROLLED THE ESTATES IN ZEELAND HE COULD ALWAYS COUNT UPON A MAJORITY VOTE IN THE STATES GENERAL IN SUPPORT OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY NOR WAS THIS ALL HOLLAND ITSELF IN GRATITUDE FOR ITS DELIVERANCE HAD BECOME ENTHUSIASTICALLY ORANGIST
960-125241-0026 IT DECLARED THE STADHOLDERSHIP HEREDITARY IN THE MALE LINE AND ITS EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED BY ZEELAND UTRECHT
960-125241-0027 GELDERLAND AND OVERYSSEL WHILE THE STATES GENERAL IN THEIR TURN MADE THE CAPTAIN AND ADMIRAL GENERALSHIP OF THE UNION HEREDITARY OFFICES NOR WAS GRATITUDE CONFINED TO THE CONFERRING OF POWERS AND DIGNITIES WHICH GAVE THE PRINCE IN ALL BUT NAME MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY
960-125241-0028 WITH A GRANT OF ONE THIRTY THIRD OF ITS DIVIDENDS
960-125241-0029 THE FIRST STEP WAS TO CONCLUDE PEACE THIS WAS NOT A DIFFICULT TASK THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND STILL MORE THE ENGLISH PEOPLE HAD THROUGHOUT BEEN AVERSE FROM FIGHTING ON THE SIDE OF THE FRENCH AGAINST THE DUTCH
960-125241-0030 CHARLES HIMSELF HAD A STRONG AFFECTION FOR HIS NEPHEW AND BEGAN TO TURN A FAVOURABLE EAR TO HIS PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS MORE ESPECIALLY AS HIS HEROIC EFFORTS TO STEM THE TIDE OF FRENCH INVASION HAD MET WITH SO MUCH SUCCESS
960-125241-0031 IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES EVERYTHING WAS FAVOURABLE TO AN UNDERSTANDING AND PEACE WAS CONCLUDED AT WESTMINSTER ON FEBRUARY NINETEENTH SIXTEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE TERMS DIFFERED LITTLE FROM THOSE OF BREDA EXCEPT THAT THE REPUBLIC
960-125241-0032 THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG WAS CONCEDED SURINAM REMAINED IN DUTCH HANDS NEW YORK WHICH HAD BEEN RETAKEN BY A SQUADRON UNDER CORNELIS EVERTSEN AUGUST SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE WAS GIVEN BACK TO THE ENGLISH CROWN NEGOTIATIONS WERE LIKEWISE OPENED WITH MUENSTER AND COLOGNE
960-125241-0033 AND WITH COLOGNE MAY ELEVENTH ON THE BASIS OF THE EVACUATION OF ALL CONQUERED TERRITORY FRANCE WAS ISOLATED AND OPPOSED NOW BY A STRONG COALITION THE REPUBLIC HAVING SECURED THE HELP OF AUSTRIA SPAIN BRANDENBURG
960-125241-0034 AND DENMARK THE CAMPAIGN OF THE SUMMER OF SIXTEEN SEVENTY FOUR THUS OPENED UNDER FAVOURING CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURRED UNTIL AUGUST ELEVENTH
960-125241-0035 IN HAINAULT THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT OUT WITH GREAT OBSTINACY AND THERE WERE HEAVY LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES THE FRENCH HOWEVER THOUGH INFERIOR IN NUMBERS HAD THE ADVANTAGE IN BEING A MORE COMPACT FORCE THAN THAT OF THE ALLIES AND WILLIAM POORLY SUPPORTED
960-125241-0036 BY THE IMPERIALIST CONTINGENTS HAD TO RETIRE FROM THE FIELD HE WAS NEVER A GREAT STRATEGIST BUT HE NOW CONDUCTED A RETREAT WHICH EXTRACTED ADMIRATION FROM HIS OPPONENTS
960-125241-0037 HIS TALENTS FOR COMMAND ALWAYS SHOWED THEMSELVES MOST CONSPICUOUSLY IN ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES HIS COOLNESS AND COURAGE IN MOMENTS OF PERIL AND DIFFICULTY NEVER DESERTED HIM AND THOUGH A STRICT DISCIPLINARIAN HE ALWAYS RETAINED THE CONFIDENCE AND AFFECTION OF HIS SOLDIERS
960-125241-0038 IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH THE WAR ON LAND DRAGGED ON WITHOUT ANY DECISIVE RESULTS DURING SIXTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE STADHOLDER WAS BADLY SUPPORTED BY HIS ALLIES AND REDUCED TO THE DEFENSIVE
960-125241-0039 BUT THOUGH TENTATIVE EFFORTS WERE MADE BY THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT TO SET ON FOOT NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE AND A GROWING PARTY IN HOLLAND WERE BEGINNING TO CLAMOUR FOR THE CESSATION OF A WAR WHICH WAS CRIPPLING THEIR TRADE AND DRAINING THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY
960-125241-0040 THE PRINCE WAS RESOLUTELY OPPOSED TO THE ENGLISH OFFER OF MEDIATION WHICH HE REGARDED AS INSINCERE AND PREMATURE
960-125241-0041 HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT THERE WAS IN ENGLAND A VERY STRONG AND WIDESPREAD OPPOSITION TO THE SUCCESSION OF JAMES DUKE OF YORK WHO MADE NO SECRET OF HIS DEVOTED ATTACHMENT TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC FAITH SO STRONG WAS THE FEELING THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO RESIGN HIS POST OF LORD HIGH ADMIRAL
960-125241-0042 THE DISLIKE AND DISTRUST HE AROUSED HAD BEEN ACCENTUATED BY HIS SECOND MARRIAGE TO MARY OF MODENA A ZEALOUS CATHOLIC WILLIAM WAS THE SON OF THE ELDEST DAUGHTER
960-125241-0043 AND TO HIM THE EYES OF A LARGE PARTY IN ENGLAND WERE TURNING
960-125241-0044 HE KEPT HIMSELF WELL INFORMED OF THE INTRIGUES OF THE COURT AND OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC OPINION BY SECRET AGENTS AND ENTERED INTO CLANDESTINE CORRESPONDENCE WITH PROMINENT STATESMEN
960-125241-0045 HE WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH OTHER THINGS AND THE AGE OF MARY SHE WAS ONLY TWELVE RENDERED IT EASY FOR HIM TO POSTPONE HIS FINAL DECISION EVENTS WERE TO FORCE HIS HAND IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE FRENCH KING FEARING THE POWER OF THE COALITION THAT WAS GROWING IN STRENGTH
960-125241-0046 ENDEAVOURED TO DETACH THE REPUBLIC BY OFFERING TO MAKE A SEPARATE PEACE ON GENEROUS TERMS
960-125241-0047 IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HOWEVER THE CAPTURE OF VALENCIENNES
960-125241-0048 APRIL ELEVENTH MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO RESIST THE GROWING IMPATIENCE OF THE BURGHER CLASS IN HOLLAND AND ESPECIALLY OF THE MERCHANTS OF AMSTERDAM AT HIS OPPOSITION TO PEACE
960-125241-0049 HE WAS ACCUSED OF WISHING TO CONTINUE THE WAR FROM MOTIVES OF PERSONAL AMBITION AND THE DESIRE OF MILITARY GLORY IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR HOWEVER
960-125241-0050 IT NO SOONER MET THAN IT SHOWED ITS STRONG SYMPATHY WITH THE NETHERLANDS AND THE KING SPEEDILY SAW THAT HE COULD NO LONGER PURSUE A POLICY OPPOSED TO THE WISHES OF HIS PEOPLE WHEN THEREFORE WILLIAM SENT OVER HIS MOST TRUSTED FRIEND AND COUNSELLOR BENTINCK
960-125241-0051 TO LONDON ON A SECRET MISSION IN THE SUMMER HE MET WITH A MOST FAVOURABLE RECEPTION
960-125241-0052 WILLIAM ACCORDINGLY ARRIVED IN LONDON ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH AND THE ASSENT OF THE KING AND THE DUKE OF YORK BEING OBTAINED THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH ALMOST INDECENT HASTE IT WAS A PURELY POLITICAL UNION AND WHEN EARLY IN DECEMBER THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF ORANGE SET SAIL FOR HOLLAND
960-125241-0053 THE YOUNG GIRL WEPT BITTERLY AT HAVING TO LEAVE HER HOME FOR A STRANGE LAND AT THE SIDE OF A COLD UNSYMPATHETIC HUSBAND THE WEEKS HE SPENT IN ENGLAND HAD BEEN UTILISED BY THE PRINCE TO GOOD PURPOSE
960-125241-0054 HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO PROMISE HIS SUPPORT BY LAND AND SEA TO THE NETHERLANDS IN CASE THE TERMS OF PEACE OFFERED BY THE ALLIES WERE REJECTED BY THE FRENCH A TREATY BETWEEN THE STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN GIVING EFFECT TO THIS PROMISE WAS ACTUALLY SIGNED ON JANUARY TWENTY NINTH SIXTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
960-125241-0055 THE RESULTS HOWEVER DID NOT ANSWER WILLIAM'S EXPECTATIONS THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND THE STATES ALIKE HAD NO TRUST IN KING CHARLES NOR WAS THE ENGLISH MATCH AT FIRST POPULAR IN HOLLAND A STRONG OPPOSITION AROSE AGAINST THE PRINCE'S WAR POLICY
960-125241-0056 THE COMMERCIAL CLASSES HAD BEEN HARD HIT BY THE FRENCH INVASION AND THEY WERE NOW SUFFERING HEAVY LOSSES AT SEA THROUGH THE DUNKIRK PRIVATEERS LED BY THE DARING JEAN BART
960-125241-0057 THE PEACE PARTY INCLUDED SUCH TRIED AND TRUSTED STATESMEN AS VAN BEVERNINGH VAN BEUNINGEN AND THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY FAGEL ALL OF THEM LOYAL COUNSELLORS OF THE STADHOLDER SO RESOLUTE WAS THE ATTITUDE OF AMSTERDAM THAT THE LEADERS OF BOTH MUNICIPAL PARTIES
960-125241-0058 VALCKENIER AND HOOFT WERE AGREED IN DEMANDING THAT THE FRENCH OFFERS OF A SEPARATE PEACE SHOULD BE ACCEPTED ON THE SAME SIDE WAS FOUND HENRY CASIMIR STADHOLDER OF FRIESLAND WHO WAS JEALOUS OF HIS COUSIN'S AUTOCRATIC EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY
960-125241-0059 WAS NOT SLOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
960-125241-0060 WILLIAM DESPITE THE ARRIVAL OF AN ENGLISH AUXILIARY FORCE UNDER MONMOUTH COULD DO LITTLE TO CHECK THE ENEMY'S SUPERIOR FORCES MEANWHILE FRENCH DIPLOMACY WAS BUSY AT AMSTERDAM AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STATES WORKING AGAINST THE WAR PARTIES
960-125241-0061 AND BY THE OFFER OF FAVOURABLE TERMS THE STATES GENERAL WERE INDUCED TO ASK FOR A TRUCE OF SIX WEEKS
960-125241-0062 SPEEDILY AGREED TO CONCLUDE PEACE ON THE FOLLOWING TERMS THE FRENCH TO RESTORE MAESTRICHT AND TO EVACUATE ALL OCCUPIED DUTCH TERRITORY AND TO MAKE A COMMERCIAL TREATY SPAIN TO SURRENDER AN IMPORTANT SLICE OF SOUTHERN FLANDERS
960-125241-0063 BUT TO BE LEFT IN POSSESSION OF A BELT OF FORTRESSES TO COVER THEIR NETHERLAND POSSESSIONS AGAINST FURTHER FRENCH ATTACK
960-125241-0064 THE FRENCH RAISED VARIOUS PRETEXTS TO DELAY THE SIGNATURE OF THE TREATY HOPING THAT MEANWHILE MONS WHICH WAS CLOSELY BELEAGUERED BY LUXEMBURG MIGHT FALL INTO THEIR HANDS AND THUS BECOME AN ASSET WHICH THEY COULD EXCHANGE FOR SOME OTHER POSSESSION
960-125241-0065 THE STATES AND THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT WERE BOTH ANXIOUS TO AVOID THIS AND THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WHO STEADILY OPPOSED THE TREATY RETURNED TOWARDS THE END OF JULY TO HIS CAMP TO WATCH THE SIEGE OF MONS AND PREVENT ITS FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY
960-125241-0066 AT THE SAME TIME JULY TWENTY SIXTH KING CHARLES WHO HAD BEEN WORKING THROUGH SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE FOR THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE NOW DECLARED THAT UNLESS THE TREATY WAS SIGNED BEFORE AUGUST ELEVENTH HE WOULD ASSIST THE ALLIES TO ENFORCE IT
960-125241-0067 THE FRENCH DIPLOMATISTS AT NIJMWEGEN HAD HITHERTO DECLARED THAT THEIR TROOPS WOULD NOT EVACUATE MAESTRICHT AND THE OTHER PLACES WHICH THEY HAD AGREED TO RESTORE TO THE STATES UNTIL BRANDENBURG AND DENMARK HAD EVACUATED THE TERRITORY THEY HAD CONQUERED FROM SWEDEN
960-125241-0068 ON AUGUST TENTH JUST BEFORE TIME FOR RESUMING HOSTILITIES HAD BEEN REACHED THEY TACTFULLY CONCEDED THIS POINT AND PROMISED IMMEDIATE EVACUATION IF THE TREATY WERE AT ONCE CONCLUDED VAN BEVERNINGH AND HIS COLLEAGUES ACCORDINGLY ACTING ON THEIR INSTRUCTIONS
960-125241-0069 AFFIXED THEIR SIGNATURES JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT THEY FELL INTO THE TRAP LAID FOR THEM FOR THE TREATY BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN WAS NOT YET SIGNED AND IT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE FRENCH TO MAKE FURTHER PRETEXTS FOR DELAY IN THE HOPE THAT MONS MEANWHILE WOULD FALL
960-125241-0070 THE REPORT OF THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE REACHED THE STADHOLDER IN HIS CAMP ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH BUT UNOFFICIALLY
960-125241-0071 AND HE FELT THAT HONOUR COMPELLED HIM TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE
960-125241-0072 A SHORT DISTANCE FROM MONS WILLIAM EXPOSED HIS LIFE FREELY AND THOUGH THE RESULT WAS NOMINALLY A DRAWN BATTLE HE ACHIEVED HIS PURPOSE
960-125241-0073 THE TREATY WAS SIGNED ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH SIXTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE PEACE OF NIJMWEGEN THUS BROUGHT HOSTILITIES TO AN END LEAVING THE UNITED PROVINCES IN POSSESSION OF ALL THEIR TERRITORY IT LASTED TEN YEARS BUT IT WAS ONLY AN ARMED TRUCE
960-125241-0074 AND HIS TIRELESS OPPONENT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE HENCEFORTH MADE IT THE ONE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE TO FORM A GRAND ALLIANCE TO CURB FRENCH AMBITION AND UPHOLD IN EUROPE WHAT WAS HENCEFORTH KNOWN AS THE BALANCE OF POWER IN SETTING ABOUT THIS TASK WILLIAM WAS CONFRONTED WITH ALMOST INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES
960-125241-0075 THE DUTCH PEOPLE GENERALLY HAD SUFFERED TERRIBLY IN THE LATE INVASIONS AND WERE HEARTILY SICK OF WAR THE INTEREST OF THE HOLLANDERS AND ESPECIALLY OF THE AMSTERDAMMERS WAS ABSORBED IN THE PEACEFUL PURSUITS OF COMMERCE
960-125241-0076 HAD NO ATTRACTION FOR THEM EVEN HAD THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR PURPOSE AND MOTIVE
960-125241-0077 THEY HELD THAT IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE REPUBLIC TO ATTEND TO ITS OWN AFFAIRS AND TO LEAVE LOUIS TO PURSUE HIS AGGRESSIVE POLICY AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES SO LONG AS HE LEFT THEM ALONE THE IDEAL WHICH WILLIAM THE THIRD HAD SET BEFORE HIM WAS THE EXACT REVERSE OF THIS AND
960-125241-0078 UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS OWN COUNTRY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE HE OFTEN SUBORDINATED ITS PARTICULAR INTERESTS TO THE WIDER EUROPEAN INTERESTS WHICH OCCUPIED HIS ATTENTION THE WORK OF BUILDING UP AFRESH A COALITION TO WITHSTAND THE EVER GROWING MENACE OF THE FORMIDABLE FRENCH POWER
960-125241-0079 COULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN MORE UNPROMISING THAN IT NOW APPEARED SPAIN WAS UTTERLY EXHAUSTED AND FEEBLE
960-125241-0080 THE ATTENTION OF THE EMPEROR WAS FULLY OCCUPIED IN DEFENDING HUNGARY AND VIENNA ITSELF AGAINST THE TURKS
960-125241-0081 A VISIT MADE BY WILLIAM TO LONDON CONVINCED HIM THAT NOTHING WAS AT PRESENT TO BE HOPED FOR FROM THAT QUARTER AT THE SAME TIME THE VERY ABLE FRENCH AMBASSADOR AT THE HAGUE D'AVAUX DID HIS UTMOST TO FOMENT THE DIVISIONS AND FACTIONS IN THE PROVINCES
960-125241-0082 HE ALWAYS INSISTED THAT HE WAS ACCREDITED TO THE STATES GENERAL
960-125241-0083 AND CARRIED ON CORRESPONDENCE AND INTRIGUES WITH THE PARTY IN AMSTERDAM OPPOSED TO THE STADHOLDER'S ANTI FRENCH POLICY THE CUMBROUS AND COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT ENABLED HIM THUS TO DO MUCH TO THWART THE PRINCE AND TO THROW OBSTACLES IN HIS WAY
960-125241-0084 THE CURIOUS THING IS THAT WILLIAM WAS SO INTENT ON HIS LARGER PROJECTS THAT HE WAS CONTENT TO USE THE POWERS HE HAD WITHOUT MAKING ANY SERIOUS ATTEMPT AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO MAKE THE MACHINE OF GOVERNMENT MORE WORKABLE BY REFORMS IN THE DIRECTION OF CENTRALISATION
960-125241-0085 IMMERSED IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS HE LEFT THE INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE HANDS OF SUBORDINATES CHOSEN RATHER FOR THEIR SUBSERVIENCE THAN FOR THEIR ABILITY AND PROBITY
960-125241-0086 HAD A LARGE PATRONAGE AND HE SHAMELESSLY ENRICHED HIMSELF BY HIS VENAL TRAFFIC IN THE DISPOSAL OF OFFICES WITHOUT A WORD OF REBUKE FROM WILLIAM IN WHOSE NAME HE ACTED ON THE CONTRARY HE CONTINUED TO ENJOY HIS FAVOUR CORRUPTION WAS SCARCELY LESS RIFE IN HOLLAND
960-125241-0087 HE HAD WALDECK AT HIS SIDE NOT MERELY AS A MILITARY ADVISER BUT AS A SKILFUL DIPLOMATIST WELL VERSED IN THE INTRICATE POLITICS OF THE SMALLER GERMAN STATES
960-125241-0088 PROVED WORTHY SUCCESSORS OF VAN BEVERNINGH AND VAN BEUNINGEN
960-125241-0089 DESPITE THE STRONG OPPOSITION HE ENCOUNTERED AT AMSTERDAM AND SOME OTHER TOWNS WHERE THE INTERESTS OF COMMERCE REIGNED SUPREME
960-125241-0090 MOST OF THEM ALWAYS READY TO HIRE OUT THEIR ARMED FORCES FOR A SUBSIDY SWEDEN ALSO OFFERED ASSISTANCE BUT BOTH ENGLAND AND BRANDENBURG WERE IN SECRET COLLUSION WITH FRANCE AND THE EMPEROR WOULD NOT MOVE OWING TO THE TURKISH MENACE
960-125241-0091 IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SPAIN WAS COMPELLED SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY THE ENTRY OF THE ARMIES OF LOUIS INTO THE SOUTHERN NETHERLANDS TO DECLARE WAR UPON FRANCE AND CALLED UPON THE STATES FOR THEIR MILITARY AID OF EIGHT THOUSAND MEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE TREATY OF NIJMWEGEN
960-125241-0092 ORANGE AT ONCE REFERRED THE MATTER TO THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND HIMSELF PROPOSED THAT SIXTEEN THOUSAND SHOULD BE SENT AS THIS HOWEVER COULD ONLY MEAN A RENEWAL OF THE WAR WITH FRANCE THE PROPOSAL MET WITH STRONG OPPOSITION IN MANY QUARTERS
960-125241-0093 AND ESPECIALLY IN AMSTERDAM PROSPERITY WAS JUST BEGINNING TO REVIVE AND A REMEMBRANCE OF PAST EXPERIENCES FILLED THE HEARTS OF MANY WITH DREAD AT THE THOUGHT OF THE FRENCH ARMIES ONCE MORE INVADING THEIR LAND
960-125241-0094 THE AMSTERDAM REGENTS EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO ENTER INTO SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH D'AVAUX AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY HENRY CASIMIR WHO WAS ALWAYS READY TO THWART HIS COUSIN'S POLICY WILLIAM WAS CHECKMATED AND AT FIRST IN HIS ANGER
960-125241-0095 INCLINED TO FOLLOW HIS FATHER'S EXAMPLE AND CRUSH THE OPPOSITION OF AMSTERDAM BY FORCE
960-125241-0096 THE SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY IN THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND HE USED THIS WITH EFFECT
960-125241-0097 AN INTERCEPTED CIPHER LETTER FROM D'AVAUX BEING SKILFULLY USED TO DISCREDIT THE AMSTERDAM LEADERS WHO WERE ACCUSED OF TRAITOROUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH A FOREIGN POWER NEVERTHELESS THE PRINCE ALTHOUGH HE WAS ABLE TO OVERRIDE ANY ACTIVE OPPOSITION AT HOME DID NOT VENTURE
960-125241-0098 SO LONG AS ENGLAND AND BRANDENBURG WERE ON FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH FRANCE TO PUT PRESSURE UPON THE STATES GENERAL THE FRENCH TROOPS TO THE PRINCE'S CHAGRIN OVERRAN FLANDERS AND HE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO CONCUR IN THE TRUCE FOR TWENTY YEARS CONCLUDED AT RATISBON
960-125241-0099 AUGUST FIFTEENTH SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH LEFT THE FRENCH KING IN POSSESSION OF ALL HIS CONQUESTS NO MORE CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF THE INFLEXIBLE RESOLVE OF WILLIAM THE THIRD CAN BE FOUND THAN THE PATIENCE HE NOW EXHIBITED HIS FAITH IN HIMSELF WAS NEVER SHAKEN
960-125241-0100 AND HIS PATIENCE IN AWAITING THE FAVOURABLE MOMENT WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE TO HIM FAR MORE APPROPRIATELY THAN TO HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER MIGHT THE NAME OF WILLIAM THE SILENT HAVE BEEN GIVEN HE HAD NO CONFIDANTS EXCEPT WALDECK AND WILLIAM BENTINCK
960-125241-0101 AND FEW COULD EVEN GUESS AT THE HIDDEN WORKINGS OF THAT SCHEMING MIND OR AT THE BURNING FIRES OF ENERGY AND WILL POWER BENEATH THE PROUD AND FRIGID RESERVE OF A MAN SO FRAIL IN BODY AND ALWAYS AILING
960-125241-0102 VERY RARELY COULD A BORN LEADER OF MEN HAVE BEEN MORE UNAMIABLE OR LESS ANXIOUS TO WIN POPULAR APPLAUSE BUT HIS WHOLE DEMEANOUR INSPIRED CONFIDENCE AND IGNORING THE MANY DIFFICULTIES AND OPPOSITIONS WHICH THWARTED HIM
960-125241-0103 HE STEADFASTLY BIDED HIS TIME AND OPPORTUNITY IT NOW CAME QUICKLY FOR THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WAS MARKED BY TWO EVENTS
960-125241-0104 AND THE REVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF NANTES WHICH WERE TO HAVE FAR REACHING CONSEQUENCES THE NEW KING OF ENGLAND WAS NOT MERELY A STRONG BUT A BIGOTED ROMAN CATHOLIC
960-125241-0105 WRONG HEADED AND FANATICAL AND FROM THE FIRST HE AIMED AT THE IMPOSSIBLE HIS ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH ABSOLUTE RULE TO BRING BACK THE ENGLISH NATION TO THE FOLD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND AS A MEANS TO THAT END
960-125241-0106 TO MAKE HIMSELF INDEPENDENT OF PARLIAMENT BY ACCEPTING SUBSIDIES FROM THE FRENCH KING WERE BOUND TO END IN CATASTROPHE
960-125241-0107 ACCESSION AFTER HAVING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS PERSECUTED THE HUGUENOTS IN DEFIANCE OF THE EDICT OF NANTES TAKEN THE STEP OF REVOKING THAT GREAT INSTRUMENT OF RELIGIOUS TOLERATION ON NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
960-125241-0108 THE EXILE OF NUMEROUS FAMILIES WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN DRIVEN OUT BY THE DRAGONNADES WAS NOW FOLLOWED BY THE EXPULSION OF THE ENTIRE HUGUENOT BODY OF ALL AT LEAST WHO REFUSED TO CONFORM TO THE CATHOLIC FAITH
960-125241-0109 HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS LEFT THEIR HOMES TO FIND REFUGE IN FOREIGN LANDS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY BUT AMONGST THEM WERE GREAT NUMBERS OF INDUSTRIOUS AND SKILLED ARTISANS AND HANDICRAFTSMEN WHO SOUGHT ASYLUM IN THE DUTCH REPUBLIC AND THERE FOUND A READY AND SYMPATHETIC WELCOME
960-125241-0110 THE ARRIVAL OF THESE UNHAPPY IMMIGRANTS HAD THE EFFECT OF AROUSING A STRONG FEELING OF INDIGNATION IN HOLLAND
960-125241-0111 BUT WAS A CRUSADE AGAINST PROTESTANTISM THE GOVERNING CLASSES IN HOLLAND ZEELAND FRIESLAND AND GRONINGEN
960-125241-0112 WERE STIRRED UP BY THE PREACHERS TO ENFORCE MORE STRICTLY THE LAWS AGAINST THE CATHOLICS IN THOSE PROVINCES FOR GENUINE ALARM WAS FELT AT THE FRENCH MENACE TO THE RELIGION FOR WHICH THEIR FATHERS HAD FOUGHT AND SUFFERED
960-125241-0113 HAD THE EFFECT OF INFLUENCING PUBLIC OPINION POWERFULLY IN THE STATES IN FAVOUR OF THEIR STADHOLDER'S WARLIKE POLICY
960-125241-0114 THE ELECTOR OF BRANDENBURG AS HEAD OF THE PRINCIPAL PROTESTANT STATE IN GERMANY HAD ALSO OFFERED AN ASYLUM TO THE FRENCH EXILES AND NOW REVERTED ONCE MORE TO HIS NATURAL ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES HE SENT HIS TRUSTED COUNCILLOR
960-125241-0115 PAUL FUCHS IN MAY SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO OFFER TO HIS NEPHEW THE PRINCE OF ORANGE HIS FRIENDLY CO OPERATION IN THE FORMATION OF A POWERFUL COALITION AGAINST FRANCE FUCHS WAS A SKILLED DIPLOMATIST
960-125241-0116 AND BY HIS MEDIATION AN UNDERSTANDING WAS ARRIVED AT BETWEEN THE STADHOLDER AND HIS OPPONENTS IN AMSTERDAM AT THE SAME TIME STRONG FAMILY INFLUENCE WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON HENRY CASIMIR OF FRIESLAND AND A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO STADHOLDERS WAS EFFECTED
960-125241-0117 WILLIAM THUS FOUND HIMSELF BEFORE THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE CAME TO AN END ABLE TO PURSUE HIS POLICY WITHOUT SERIOUS LET OR HINDRANCE HE WAS QUITE READY TO SEIZE HIS OPPORTUNITY
960-125241-0118 THE NAVAL POWER AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF ENGLAND WERE NEEDED TO ENABLE THE COALITION
960-125241-0119 WILLIAM WATCHED KEENLY ALL THAT WAS GOING ON AND KEPT HIMSELF IN CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE WITH SEVERAL OF THE PRINCIPAL MALCONTENTS HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT ALL EYES WERE TURNING TO HIM AND HE ACCEPTED THE POSITION AS THE NATURAL DEFENDER SHOULD THE NEED ARISE
960-125241-0120 OF ENGLAND'S CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES THE NEED AROSE AND THE CALL CAME IN THE SUMMER OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND IT FOUND WILLIAM PREPARED
960-125241-0121 SPEEDILY FOLLOWED ON JUNE TENTH BY THE BIRTH OF A PRINCE OF WALES THE REPORT WAS SPREAD THAT THE CHILD WAS SUPPOSITITIOUS AND IT WAS ACCEPTED AS TRUE BY LARGE NUMBERS OF PERSONS INCLUDING THE PRINCESS ANNE AND ALSO ON THE STRENGTH OF HER TESTIMONY
960-125241-0122 BY THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF ORANGE
