8075-279239-0000 PERSONALLY I CLASS ROAST BEEF WITH WATERCRESS AND VANILLA CORNSTARCH PUDDING AS TASTY ARTICLES OF DIET IT UNDOUBTEDLY HAS MORE THAN THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF CALORIES
8075-279239-0001 BUT FOR ALL THAT I CAN'T SEEM TO FEEL THAT I AM HAVING A GOOD TIME WHILE I AM EATING IT IT STIMULATES THE SAME NERVE CENTERS IN ME THAT A LANTERN SLIDE LECTURE ON PALESTINE THE OLD AND THE NEW DOES
8075-279239-0002 HOWEVER I HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT BORED BY IT IN FACT I HAVE SEEN THEM DELIBERATELY ORDER IT IN A RESTAURANT WHEN THEY HAD THE CHOICE OF SOMETHING ELSE SO I THOUGHT THAT THE ONLY FAIR THING I COULD DO WOULD BE TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER AND SEE IF
8075-279239-0003 IN THIS GREAT CITY THERE WEREN'T SOME DIFFERENT WAYS OF SERVING ROAST BEEF TO VARY ITS MONOTONY ROAST BEEF IS NOT THE SAME PRICE IN ALL EATING PLACES WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
8075-279239-0004 THAT MAKES IT DISTINCTIVE FROM THE SPECIAL TO DAY ROAST BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES OF THE BOWERY RESTAURANT TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS I STARTED OUT ON A TOUR OF THE REPRESENTATIVE EATING PLACES
8075-279239-0005 OF SOME OF OUR BEST KNOWN STRATA OF SOCIETY AND WHATEVER MY CONCLUSIONS ARE YOU MAY BE SURE THAT THEY ARE THOROUGHLY INEXPERT FIRST I TRIED OUT WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE BAY STATE LUNCH SO CALLED BECAUSE ON THURSDAYS
8075-279239-0006 THEY HAVE A FISHCAKE SPECIAL IT IS ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF SELF SERVING LUNCHROOMS WHERE YOU APPROACH THE MARBLE COUNTER AND GIVE YOUR ORDER IN A LOW TONE TO A MAN IN A BARBER'S COAT AND THEN REPEAT IT AT INTERVALS OF ONE MINUTE
8075-279239-0007 EACH TIME LOUDER AND EACH TIME TO A DIFFERENT MAN UNTIL YOU ARE FORCED TO POINT TO A TUB OF SALMON SALAD AND SAY SOME OF THAT FOR WHICH YOUR TICKET IS PUNCHED AND YOU ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE YOUR PORTION AND NURSE IT ON THE OVER DEVELOPED ARM OF A CHAIR
8075-279239-0008 HERE THE ROAST BEEF SHOT THROUGH THE PUNCH AND JUDY ARRANGEMENT IN THE WALL A PIECE OF MEAT ABOUT AS LARGE AROUND AS A MAN'S SIZE MITTEN STEEPING IN ITS OWN GRAVY
8075-279239-0009 WHERE BUSINESS MEN ARE WONT TO GATHER FOR LUNCHEON MEN WHO PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THEIR ACUMEN AND ADHERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF EFFICIENCY THE PLACE HAS A FRENCH NAME
8075-279239-0010 WHEN I WAS A BOY I USED TO HAVE TO DIG ESCAROLE OUT OF THE FRONT LAWN WITH A TROWEL SO THAT THE GRASS COULD HAVE A CHANCE FOR SEVENTY FIVE CENTS THE MEAT BULKED A LITTLE LARGER THAN AT THE BAY STATE LUNCH BUT WHEN THE FAT HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND TRIMMED OFF
8075-279239-0011 THE SALVAGE WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BOY'S MITTEN AS FOR THE TASTE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THAT I COULD DETECT WAS THAT ONE HAD BEEN HOT AND THE OTHER COLD AND INCIDENTALLY THE WAITER HAD SOME BOSOM FRIENDS IN THE NEXT ROOM
8075-279239-0012 WHO FASCINATED HIM SO THAT IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO MAKE HIM SEE THAT IF HE DIDN'T COME AROUND TO ME ONCE IN A WHILE JUST AS A MATTER OF FORM THERE WOULD BE NO WAY FOR ME TO TIP HIM BEEF AND SALAD PLUS TIP NINETY CENTS
8075-279239-0013 BUSY HOME RESTAURANT ON A BLACK BOARD IN FRONT WAS WRITTEN ROAST BEEF MASHED POTATOES AND COFFEE TEN CENTS MY OLD HUNGER AGAIN SEIZED ME I SAID TO MYSELF LOOK HERE BE A MAN THIS THING IS GETTING THE BEST OF YOU
8075-279239-0014 BUT BEFORE I KNEW IT I WAS INSIDE AND SEATED AT AN OILCLOTH COVERED TABLE SAYING IN A HOARSE VOICE ROAST BEEF THE WAITER WAS DRESSED IN AN INFORMAL COSTUME WITH HIS SHIRT SLEEVES ROLLED UP
8075-279239-0015 BUT HE SMILED GENIALLY WHEN HE TOOK MY ORDER AND WAS BACK WITH IT IN TWO MINUTES THE ARTICLE ITSELF WAS OF THE REGULATION SIZE CUT SOMEWHAT THINNER PERHAPS AND BORDERING ON THE GRAY IN HUE BUT UNDOUBTEDLY ROAST BEEF
8075-279239-0016 IT TOO HAD AN AFFINITY FOR ITS OWN GRAVY AND HID ITSELF MODESTLY UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF MASHED POTATOES A CUP OF COFFEE WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE TEN CENTS INITIAL EXPENSE BUT I SOMEHOW WASN'T COFFEE THIRSTY THAT NIGHT
8075-279239-0017 AND SO DIDN'T SAMPLE IT BUT I DID HELP MYSELF TO THE PLATE PILED HIGH WITH FRESH BREAD WHICH WAS LEFT IN FRONT OF ME ALL IN ALL IT WAS WHAT I SHOULD CALL A REPRESENTATIVE ROAST BEEF DINNER AND I GOT MORE THAN TEN CENTS WORTH OF CALORIES I KNOW
8075-279239-0018 BUT SO FAR I HAD KEPT BELOW THE FOURTEENTH STREET BELT IN MY INVESTIGATIONS ROAST BEEF IS A COSMOPOLITAN HABIT AND KNOWS NO ARBITRARY BOUNDARIES SO I WENT UPTOWN INTO ONE OF THE LARGER OF OUR LARGEST HOTELS
8075-279239-0019 AS TO BE REPRESENTED BY A DIFFERENT ASSEMBLYMAN HERE I FELT WOULD BE THE TEST COULD ROAST BEEF COME BACK SURROUNDED BY GLITTERING CHANDELIERS AND RICH TAPESTRIES SNOWY TABLE LINEN AND SILVER SERVICE
8075-279239-0020 HERE WAS THE CHANCE FOR THE ORDINARY ROAST BEEF TO BECOME A VERITABLE DAINTY WITH SOME CHARACTER SOME DISTINCTIVE TOUCH THAT SHOULD LIFT IT ABOVE ALL THAT ROAST BEEF HAS EVER MEANT BEFORE I ENTERED THE DINING ROOM IN HIGH HOPES
8075-279239-0021 CLAD IN A WALKING SUIT OF VIRILE TWEED I CONSIDERED MYSELF RESPECTABLY DRESSED NOT OSTENTATIOUSLY RESPECTABLE MIND YOU BUT SINCE MOST OF THE OTHER DINERS WERE IN EVENING DRESS RATHER DISTINGUE I THOUGHT
8075-279239-0022 BUT APPARENTLY THE HOTEL RETAINERS WEREN'T TRAINED TO LOOK THROUGH A ROUGH EXTERIOR AND FIND THE STERLING QUALITIES BENEATH THEY LOOKED THROUGH MY ROUGH EXTERIOR ALL RIGHT BUT THEY DIDN'T STOP AT MY STERLING QUALITIES
8075-279239-0023 THEY LOOKED RIGHT THROUGH TO THE MAN BEHIND ME AND GAVE HIM THE SIGNAL THAT THERE WAS A SEAT FOR HIM NOT TO BE OUTDONE HOWEVER I GOT MY PLACE IN THE SUN BY CLEVERLY TRIPPING MY RIVAL AS HE PASSED ME SO THAT HE FELL INTO THE FOUNTAIN ARRANGEMENT
8075-279239-0024 FIVE MINUTES LATER ANOTHER MAN PLACED A KNIFE AND SPOON AT MY PLATE LATER IN THE EVENING A BOY WITH A BASKET OF ROLLS WANDERED BY AND DEPOSITED ONE ON MY TABLE WITH A PAIR OF PINCERS PERSONALLY I WAS RATHER GLAD THAT IT WAS WORKING OUT THIS WAY
8075-279239-0025 BUT I MIGHT HAVE REALLY BEEN IN A HURRY FOR MY DINNER IT WASN'T LONG AS THE CROW FLIES BEFORE ONE OF THE THIRD ASSISTANT WAITERS UNLOOSENED ENOUGH TO DROP ROUND AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE I WANTED BESIDES ONE ROLL AND A KNIFE AND SPOON
8075-279239-0026 I LOOKED OVER THE MENU AS IF I WERE IN A PRETTY CAPTIOUS MOOD AND THEN WITH THE AIR OF AN EPICURE WHO HAS TASTED TO THE DREGS ALL THE CONDIMENTS OF ARABIA AND WHOSE JADED PALATE REFUSES TO THRILL ANY LONGER I ORDERED
8075-279239-0027 THAT LOOKED ENOUGH SIGHT BETTER THAN HIS BUT THERE IS NO USE IN MAKING A SCENE WHEN IT CAN BE AVOIDED DURING THE NEXT TWENTY MINUTES THE ORCHESTRA PLAYED ONCE AND I ATE MY ROLL THEN THE ROAST BEEF CAME ON A SILVER PLATTER
8075-279239-0028 WITH A SILVER COVER IT WAS PLACED BEFORE ME UNDER THE BEST POSSIBLE SCENIC CONDITIONS BUT THE THING THAT MET MY GAZE WHEN THE COVER WAS LIFTED MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE BEEN THE SAME PROPERTY PIECE OF ROAST BEEF
8075-279239-0029 THAT WAS KEEPING COMPANY WITH A DAB OF MASHED POTATO IN THE BAY STATE LUNCH IT HAD A TRIFLE MORE FAT WAS JUST A SHADE PINKER AND PERHAPS A MICROMETER COULD HAVE DETECTED A BIT MORE BULK BUT SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED
8075-279239-0030 OR SO FAR AS THE CALORIES WERE CONCERNED IT WAS THE SAME I WON'T SAY THAT IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ROAST BEEF SPECIAL OF THE BOWERY RESTAURANT BECAUSE THE SERVICE IN THE BOWERY RESTAURANT WAS INFINITELY BETTER AS A FITTING GARNITURE TO SUCH A DISH
8075-279239-0031 THERE WAS A CORSAGE OF WATERCRESS DRAPED ON THE CORNER OF THE SALVER AT ANY RATE IT COULD BE SAID FOR IT THAT IT WAS NOT INTOXICATING AND SO COULD NEVER CAUSE ANY REAL MISERY IN THIS WORLD
8075-279239-0032 I NIBBLED AT MY ROAST BEEF BUT MY SPIRIT WAS BROKEN I HAD GONE THROUGH A WEEK OF SELF DENIAL ORDERING ROAST BEEF WHEN I CRAVED EDIBLES EATING AT RESTAURANTS WHILE MY FAMILY WAITED FOR ME AT HOME
8075-279239-0033 AND HERE WAS THE RESULT OF MY RESEARCHES ROAST BEEF IS ROAST BEEF AND NOTHING CAN PREVENT IT FROM THE TEN CENT ORDER OF THE BUSY HOME RESTAURANT UP THROUGH TO THE PIECE I WAS THEN EATING IT WAS THE SAME GRIM REALITY
8075-279239-0034 THE ONLY JUSTIFICATION FOR A DIFFERENCE IN PRICE BEING A SILVER SALVER OR A WAITER IN A TUXEDO BUT I SAID TO MYSELF EIGHTY CENTS ISN'T SO MUCH AT THAT
8075-279239-0035 THIS QUITE RECONCILED ME UNTIL MY CHECK WAS BROUGHT THERE ADDED TO THE INITIAL EXPENSE OF EIGHTY CENTS WAS THE UPKEEP SUCH AS
8075-279239-0036 AND TO THIS MUST BE ADDED THE MODEST FEE OF TWENTY CENTS TO THE WAITER AND TEN CENTS TO THE HAT BOY WHO GAVE ME THE WRONG HAT TOTAL EXPENSE FOR ONE PIECE OF ROAST BEEF
8075-279239-0037 THESE INVESTIGATIONS MAY NOT PROVE TO BE MUCH OF A CONTRIBUTION TO MODERN SCIENCE OR ECONOMICS I DOUBT IF THEY ARE EVER INCORPORATED IN ANY TEXTBOOK EVEN IF IT SHOULD BE A TEXTBOOK ON THIS VERY SUBJECT
8075-279239-0038 BUT I MUST TAKE CREDIT TO MYSELF FOR ONE THING
