7297-275885-0000 THE LIBRARY SMOKING ROOM AND DEN IN THE DAYS WHEN FURNITURE WAS DEFINED AS THAT WHICH MAY BE CARRIED ABOUT THE NATURAL BOOKCASE WAS A CHEST WITH A STRONG LOCK THESE CHESTS PACKED WITH PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPTS
7297-275885-0001 FOLLOWED THE PRINCE OR NOBLE FROM ONE CASTLE TO ANOTHER AND WERE EVEN CARRIED AFTER HIM INTO CAMP BEFORE THE INVENTION OF PRINTING WHEN TWENTY OR THIRTY BOOKS FORMED AN EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE LIBRARY AND MANY GREAT PERSONAGES WERE CONTENT WITH THE POSSESSION OF ONE VOLUME
7297-275885-0002 SUCH AMBULANT BOOKCASES WERE SUFFICIENT FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MOST EAGER BIBLIOPHILE OCCASIONALLY THE VOLUMES WERE KEPT IN A SMALL PRESS OR CUPBOARD AND PLACED IN A CHEST ONLY WHEN THEIR OWNER TRAVELLED BUT THE BOOKCASE AS NOW KNOWN
7297-275885-0003 DID NOT TAKE SHAPE UNTIL MUCH LATER FOR WHEN BOOKS MULTIPLIED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF PRINTING IT BECAME CUSTOMARY TO FIT UP FOR THEIR RECEPTION LITTLE ROOMS CALLED CABINETS IN THE FAMOUS CABINET OF CATHERINE DE MEDICI AT BLOIS
7297-275885-0004 THE WALLS ARE LINED WITH BOOK SHELVES CONCEALED BEHIND SLIDING PANELS A CONTRIVANCE RENDERED DOUBLY NECESSARY BY THE GENERAL INSECURITY OF PROPERTY AND BY THE FACT THAT THE BOOKS OF THAT PERIOD WHETHER IN MANUSCRIPT OR PRINTED
7297-275885-0005 WERE MADE SUMPTUOUS AS CHURCH JEWELRY BY THE ART OF PAINTER AND GOLDSMITH LONG AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRINTING PRESS BOOKS EXCEPT IN THE HANDS OF THE SCHOLAR CONTINUED TO BE A KIND OF CURIOSITY LIKE OTHER OBJECTS OF ART
7297-275885-0006 LESS AN INTELLECTUAL NEED THAN A TREASURE UPON WHICH RICH MEN PRIDED THEMSELVES IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THAT THE TASTE FOR BOOKS BECAME A TASTE FOR READING FRANCE LED THE WAY IN THIS NEW FASHION
7297-275885-0007 WHICH WAS ASSIDUOUSLY CULTIVATED IN THOSE PARISIAN SALONS OF WHICH MADAME DE RAMBOUILLET'S IS THE RECOGNIZED TYPE THE POSSESSION OF A LIBRARY HITHERTO THE PRIVILEGE OF KINGS
7297-275885-0008 BEAUTIFUL BINDINGS WERE STILL HIGHLY VALUED AND SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL WORK PRODUCED IN FRANCE BELONGS TO THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES
7297-275885-0009 BUT AS PEOPLE BEGAN TO BUY BOOKS FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED LESS EXAGGERATED IMPORTANCE WAS ATTACHED TO THEIR EXTERIOR SO THAT BINDINGS THOUGH PERFECT AS TASTE AND SKILL COULD MAKE THEM
7297-275885-0010 THUS UTILIZING THE BOOKS AS PART OF HIS SCHEME OF DECORATION THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY THE MOST PRACTICAL BUT THE MOST DECORATIVE WAY OF HOUSING ANY COLLECTION OF BOOKS LARGE ENOUGH TO BE SO EMPLOYED
7297-275885-0011 TO ADORN THE WALLS OF A LIBRARY AND THEN CONCEAL THEIR ORNAMENTATION BY EXPENSIVE BOOKCASES IS A WASTE OR RATHER A MISAPPLICATION OF EFFECTS ALWAYS A SIN AGAINST AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES THE IMPORTANCE OF BOOKBINDINGS AS AN ELEMENT IN HOUSE DECORATION HAS ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED UPON
7297-275885-0012 BUT SINCE A TASTE FOR GOOD BINDINGS HAS COME TO BE REGARDED AS A COLLECTOR'S FAD LIKE ACCUMULATING SNUFF BOXES OR BAISERS DE PAIX IT SEEMS NEEDFUL TO POINT OUT HOW OBVIOUS AND VALUABLE A MEANS OF DECORATION IS LOST BY DISREGARDING THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF BOOKS
7297-275885-0013 TO BE DECORATIVE A BOOKCASE NEED NOT CONTAIN THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE MASTER BINDERS
7297-275885-0014 OR THE WORK OF ROGER PAYNE AND SANDERSON UNSURPASSED AS THEY ARE IN COLOR VALUE ORDINARY BINDINGS OF HALF MOROCCO OR VELLUM FORM AN EXPANSE OF WARM LUSTROUS COLOR SUCH BINDINGS ARE COMPARATIVELY INEXPENSIVE
7297-275885-0015 THE QUESTION OF BINDING LEADS INCIDENTALLY TO THAT OF EDITIONS THOUGH THE LATTER IS HARDLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS BOOK PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEGUN TO NOTICE THE OUTSIDE OF THEIR BOOKS NATURALLY COME TO APPRECIATE PAPER AND TYPE
7297-275885-0016 AND THUS LEARN THAT THE MODERN BOOK IS TOO OFTEN MERELY THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE VEHICLE FOR PUTTING WORDS INTO PRINT THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT SOME IMPROVEMENT AND IT IS NOW NOT UNUSUAL FOR A PUBLISHER IN BRINGING OUT A BOOK AT THE ORDINARY RATES
7297-275885-0017 TO PRODUCE ALSO A SMALL EDITION IN LARGE PAPER COPIES THESE LARGE PAPER BOOKS THOUGH AS YET FAR FROM PERFECT IN TYPE AND MAKE UP ARE SUPERIOR TO THE AVERAGE COMMERCIAL ARTICLE AND APART FROM THEIR ARTISTIC MERIT ARE IN THEMSELVES A GOOD INVESTMENT
7297-275885-0018 THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD BOTH EDITION AND BINDING WILL DO BETTER TO BUY LARGE PAPER BOOKS OR CURRENT FIRST EDITIONS IN BOARDS THAN HANDSOMELY BOUND VOLUMES UNWORTHY IN TYPE AND PAPER THE PLAIN PAPER OR BUCKRAM COVERS OF A GOOD PUBLISHER ARE
7297-275885-0019 IN FACT MORE DECORATIVE BECAUSE MORE ARTISTIC THAN SHOWY TREE CALF OR ANTIQUE MOROCCO THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO THE LIBRARY ITSELF PLAIN SHELVES FILLED WITH GOOD EDITIONS IN GOOD BINDINGS ARE MORE TRULY DECORATIVE THAN ORNATE BOOKCASES LINED WITH TAWDRY BOOKS
7297-275885-0020 IT HAS ALREADY BEEN POINTED OUT THAT THE PLAN OF BUILDING BOOK SHELVES INTO THE WALLS IS THE MOST DECORATIVE AND THE MOST PRACTICAL
7297-275885-0021 THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THIS TREATMENT ARE FOUND IN FRANCE THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS THUS DECORATED WERE USUALLY OF PANELLED WOOD EITHER IN NATURAL OAK OR WALNUT
7297-275885-0022 WILL SHOW HOW SELDOM THE DETACHED BOOKCASE WAS USED IN FRENCH LIBRARIES BUT FEW MODELS ARE TO BE FOUND AND THESE WERE PROBABLY DESIGNED FOR USE IN THE BOUDOIR OR STUDY
7297-275885-0023 IN ENGLAND WHERE PRIVATE LIBRARIES WERE FEWER AND LESS EXTENSIVE THE MOVABLE BOOKCASE WAS MUCH USED AND EXAMPLES OF BUILT IN SHELVES ARE PROPORTIONATELY RARER
7297-275885-0024 AND IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ACCORDING TO JOHN EVELYN THE THREE NATIONS OF GREAT BRITAIN CONTAINED FEWER BOOKS THAN PARIS ALMOST ALL THE OLD BOOKCASES HAD ONE FEATURE IN COMMON THAT IS THE LOWER CUPBOARD WITH SOLID DOORS THE BOOKCASE PROPER RESTED UPON THIS PROJECTING CUPBOARD
7297-275885-0025 THUS RAISING THE BOOKS ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE FURNITURE THE PREVALENT FASHION OF LOW BOOK SHELVES STARTING FROM THE FLOOR AND NOT EXTENDING MUCH HIGHER THAN THE DADO MOULDING HAS PROBABLY BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE OTHER RECENT FASHION OF LOW STUDDED ROOMS
7297-275885-0026 ARCHITECTS ARE BEGINNING TO REDISCOVER THE FORGOTTEN FACT THAT THE STUD OF A ROOM SHOULD BE REGULATED BY THE DIMENSIONS OF ITS FLOOR SPACE SO THAT IN THE NEWER HOUSES THE DWARF BOOKCASE IS NO LONGER A NECESSITY IT IS CERTAINLY LESS CONVENIENT THAN THE TALL OLD FASHIONED PRESS
7297-275885-0027 FOR NOT ONLY MUST ONE KNEEL TO REACH THE LOWER SHELVES BUT THE BOOKS ARE HIDDEN AND ACCESS TO THEM IS OBSTRUCTED BY THEIR BEING ON A LEVEL WITH THE FURNITURE THE GENERAL DECORATION OF THE LIBRARY SHOULD BE OF SUCH CHARACTER AS TO FORM A BACKGROUND OR SETTING TO THE BOOKS
7297-275885-0028 RATHER THAN TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THEM THE RICHLY ADORNED ROOM IN WHICH BOOKS ARE BUT A MINOR INCIDENT IS IN FACT NO LIBRARY AT ALL THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE DECORATIONS OF A LIBRARY SHOULD NOT BE SPLENDID BUT IN THAT CASE THE BOOKS MUST BE SPLENDID TOO
7297-275885-0029 AND SUFFICIENT IN NUMBER TO DOMINATE ALL THE ACCESSORY DECORATIONS OF THE ROOM WHEN THERE ARE BOOKS ENOUGH IT IS BEST TO USE THEM AS PART OF THE DECORATIVE TREATMENT OF THE WALLS
7297-275885-0030 SPACE MAY OF COURSE BE GAINED BY MEANS OF A SERIES OF BOOKCASES PROJECTING INTO THE ROOM AND FORMING DEEP BAYS ALONG EACH OF THE WALLS BUT THIS ARRANGEMENT IS SELDOM NECESSARY SAVE IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY
7297-275885-0031 THE SMOKING ROOM PROPER WITH ITS MISE EN SCENE OF TURKISH DIVANS NARGHILEHS BRASS COFFEE TRAYS AND OTHER ORIENTAL PROPERTIES IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED A NECESSITY IN THE MODERN HOUSE
7297-275885-0032 SINCE THE LATTER WORD SEEMS TO HAVE ATTAINED THE DIGNITY OF A TECHNICAL TERM
7297-275885-0033 IT IS USUALLY CONCEDED THAT COMMON SENSE SHOULD REGULATE THE FURNISHING OF THE DEN FRAGILE CHAIRS LACE PETTICOAT LAMP SHADES AND IRRELEVANT BRIC A BRAC ARE CONSEQUENTLY EXCLUDED AND THE MASTER'S SENSE OF COMFORT OFTEN EXPRESSES ITSELF IN A SET OF OFFICE FURNITURE
7297-275885-0034 A ROLLER TOP DESK A REVOLVING CHAIR AND OTHERS OF THE PUFFY TYPE ALREADY DESCRIBED AS THE ACCEPTED MODEL OF A LUXURIOUS SEAT
7297-275885-0035 PROTOTYPES OF THE MODERN ROLLER TOP AND THE CANE OR LEATHER SEATED WRITING CHAIR WITH ROUNDED BACK AND FIVE SLIM STRONG LEGS
7297-275885-0036 CONVENIENCE WAS NOT SACRIFICED TO BEAUTY IN EITHER DESK OR CHAIR BUT BOTH THE OLD PIECES BEING DESIGNED BY SKILLED CABINET MAKERS WERE AS DECORATIVE AS THEY WERE USEFUL THERE SEEMS IN FACT NO REASON WHY THE MODERN DEN SHOULD NOT RESEMBLE THE FINANCIERS BUREAUX SEEN IN SO MANY OLD PRINTS
7297-275885-0037 REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE TO THE WAY IN WHICH EVEN IN SMALL HOUSES A ROOM MAY BE SACRIFICED TO A SUPPOSED EFFECT OR TO SOME INHERITED TRADITION AS TO ITS FORMER USE
7297-275885-0038 THUS THE FAMILY DRAWING ROOM IS TOO OFTEN MADE UNINHABITABLE FROM SOME VAGUE FEELING THAT A DRAWING ROOM IS NOT WORTHY OF ITS NAME UNLESS TOO FINE TO SIT IN
7297-275885-0039 WHILE THE SMALL FRONT ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR IN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSE THE ONLY CORNER GIVEN OVER TO THE MASTER IS THROWN INTO THE HALL EITHER THAT THE HOUSE MAY APPEAR LARGER AND HANDSOMER OR FROM SHEER INABILITY TO MAKE SO SMALL A ROOM HABITABLE
7297-275885-0040 CLOSE TO THE FRONT DOOR WHILE THERE IS USUALLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM FACING THE WINDOW ONE AT LEAST OF THESE OPENINGS BEING AS A RULE OF EXAGGERATED WIDTH IN SUCH CASES THE DOOR IN THE SIDE OF THE ROOM SHOULD BE WALLED UP
7297-275885-0041 THE BEST WAY OF OBTAINING AN EFFECT OF SIZE IS TO PANEL THE WALLS BY MEANS OF CLEAR CUT ARCHITECTURAL MOULDINGS A FEW STRONG VERTICAL LINES WILL GIVE DIGNITY TO THE ROOM AND HEIGHT TO THE CEILING
7297-275885-0042 THE WALLS SHOULD BE FREE FROM PATTERN AND LIGHT IN COLOR SINCE DARK WALLS NECESSITATE MUCH ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND HAVE THE DISADVANTAGE OF MAKING A ROOM LOOK SMALL THE CEILING IF NOT PLAIN MUST BE ORNAMENTED WITH THE LIGHTEST TRACERY AND SUPPORTED BY A CORNICE CORRESPONDINGLY SIMPLE IN DESIGN
7297-275885-0043 HEAVY CEILING MOULDINGS ARE OBVIOUSLY OUT OF PLACE IN A SMALL ROOM AND A PLAIN EXPANSE OF PLASTER IS ALWAYS PREFERABLE TO MISAPPLIED ORNAMENT A SINGLE CURTAIN MADE OF SOME FLEXIBLE MATERIAL SUCH AS CORDUROY OR THIN UNLINED DAMASK
7297-275885-0044 AND SO HUNG THAT IT MAY BE READILY DRAWN BACK DURING THE DAY IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE WINDOW WHILE IN A CORNER NEAR THIS WINDOW MAY BE PLACED AN EASY CHAIR AND A SMALL SOLIDLY MADE TABLE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD A LAMP AND A BOOK OR TWO THESE ROOMS IN SOME RECENTLY BUILT TOWN HOUSES CONTAIN CHIMNEYS SET IN AN ANGLE OF THE WALL
7297-275885-0045 A MISPLACED ATTEMPT AT QUAINTNESS MAKING IT INCONVENIENT TO SIT NEAR THE HEARTH AND SERIOUSLY INTERFERING WITH THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE ROOM WHEN THE CHIMNEY OCCUPIES THE CENTRE OF THE LONGITUDINAL WALL THERE IS SPACE EVEN IN A VERY NARROW ROOM FOR A GROUP OF CHAIRS ABOUT THE FIREPLACE
7297-275885-0046 PROVIDED AS WE ARE NOW SUPPOSING THE OPENING IN THE PARALLEL WALL HAS BEEN CLOSED A BOOKCASE OR SOME OTHER HIGH PIECE OF FURNITURE MAY BE PLACED ON EACH SIDE OF THE MANTEL AND THERE WILL BE SPACE OPPOSITE FOR A SOFA AND A GOOD SIZED WRITING TABLE
