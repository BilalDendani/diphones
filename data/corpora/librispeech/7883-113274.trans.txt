7883-113274-0000 ALMOST STARVED AND VERY ILL SHE HAD WALKED A LONG WAY FOR HER SHOES WERE WORN TO PIECES BUT WHERE SHE CAME FROM OR WHERE SHE WAS GOING NOBODY KNEW AS SHE HAD NO MONEY SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE POORHOUSE
7883-113274-0001 THE LOCKET FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE MISTRESS OF THE POORHOUSE WHO WAS NAMED MISSUS BUMBLE IT CONTAINED THE DEAD MOTHER'S WEDDING RING AND AS MISSUS BUMBLE WAS A DISHONEST WOMAN
7883-113274-0002 SHE HID BOTH LOCKET AND RING INTENDING SOMETIME TO SELL THEM THE BABY WAS LEFT WITH NO ONE TO CARE FOR IT
7883-113274-0003 AND HAD LITTLE TO EAT AND MANY WHIPPINGS MISTER BUMBLE THE MASTER OF THE POORHOUSE WAS A POMPOUS SELF IMPORTANT BULLY WHO BROWBEAT EVERY ONE WEAKER THAN HIMSELF
7883-113274-0004 AND SCOLDED AND CUFFED THE PAUPERS TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT IT WAS HE WHO NAMED THE BABY OLIVER TWIST HE USED TO NAME ALL THE BABIES AS THEY CAME ALONG BY THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET
7883-113274-0005 THE ONE BEFORE OLIVER WAS NAMED SWUBBLE THEN CAME OLIVER WITH A T THE NEXT WOULD BE UNWIN THE NEXT VILKINS
7883-113274-0006 THEN HE WOULD BEGIN THE ALPHABET ALL OVER AGAIN LITTLE OLIVER THE BABY GREW WITHOUT ANY IDEA OF WHO HE WAS WHEN HE WAS A YEAR OLD HE WAS SENT TO THE POOR FARM WHERE AN OLD WOMAN TOOK CARE OF ORPHAN CHILDREN
7883-113274-0007 FOR A VERY SMALL SUM APIECE EACH WEEK THIS MONEY WHICH WAS PAID BY THE TOWN WAS HARDLY ENOUGH TO BUY THEM FOOD BUT NEVERTHELESS THE OLD WOMAN TOOK GOOD CARE TO SAVE THE BIGGER SHARE FOR HERSELF
7883-113274-0008 HE LIVED THERE TILL HE WAS A PALE HANDSOME BOY OF NINE YEARS AND THEN HE WAS TAKEN TO THE WORKHOUSE WHERE WITH MANY OTHER BOYS OF HIS OWN AGE OR OLDER HE HAD TO WORK HARD ALL DAY PICKING OAKUM
7883-113274-0009 THE BOYS HAD NOTHING BUT THIN GRUEL FOR THEIR MEALS WITH AN ONION TWICE A WEEK AND HALF A ROLL ON SUNDAYS THEY ATE IN A GREAT STONE HALL IN ONE END OF WHICH STOOD THE BIG COPPER OF GRUEL
7883-113274-0010 WHICH MISTER BUMBLE LADLED OUT EACH BOY GOT ONLY ONE HELPING AND THE BOWLS NEVER NEEDED WASHING BECAUSE WHEN THE MEAL WAS THROUGH THERE WAS NOT A DROP OF GRUEL LEFT IN THEM
7883-113274-0011 AFTER EACH MEAL THEY ALL SAT STARING AT THE COPPER AND SUCKING THEIR FINGERS BUT NOBODY DARED ASK FOR MORE ONE DAY THEY FELT SO TERRIBLY HUNGRY
7883-113274-0012 THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST BOYS SAID UNLESS HE GOT ANOTHER HELPING OF GRUEL HE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD HAVE TO EAT THE BOY WHO SLEPT NEXT HIM THE LITTLE BOYS ALL BELIEVED THIS AND CAST LOTS TO SEE WHO SHOULD ASK FOR MORE
7883-113274-0013 IT FELL TO OLIVER TWIST SO THAT NIGHT AFTER SUPPER THOUGH HE WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED OLIVER ROSE AND WENT UP TO THE END OF THE ROOM AND SAID TO MISTER BUMBLE PLEASE SIR
7883-113274-0014 I WANT SOME MORE MISTER BUMBLE WAS SO SURPRISED HE TURNED PALE WHAT HE GASPED PLEASE SIR SAID OLIVER AGAIN I WANT SOME MORE
7883-113274-0015 MISTER BUMBLE PICKED UP THE LADLE AND STRUCK OLIVER ON THE HEAD WITH IT THEN HE POUNCED ON HIM AND SHOOK HIM WHEN HE WAS TIRED SHAKING HIM HE DRAGGED HIM AWAY AND SHUT HIM UP IN A DARK ROOM
7883-113274-0016 WHERE HE STAYED A WHOLE WEEK AND WAS ONLY TAKEN OUT ONCE A DAY TO BE WHIPPED THEN TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF HIM A NOTICE WAS PASTED ON THE GATE OF THE WORKHOUSE
7883-113274-0017 AND DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM THE FIRST ONE WHO CAME BY WAS A MIDDLE AGED CHIMNEY SWEEP WHO WANTED A BOY TO CLIMB UP THE INSIDES OF CHIMNEYS AND CLEAN OUT THE SOOT THIS WAS A DANGEROUS THING TO DO FOR SOMETIMES THE BOYS WHO DID IT
7883-113274-0018 HE BURST OUT CRYING SO THAT A KIND HEARTED MAGISTRATE INTERFERED AND WOULD NOT LET THE CHIMNEY SWEEP HAVE HIM MISTER BUMBLE FINALLY GAVE HIM TO THE VILLAGE UNDERTAKER
7883-113274-0019 AND THERE HE HAD TO MIND THE SHOP AND DO ALL THE CHORES HE SLEPT UNDER THE COUNTER AMONG PILES OF EMPTY COFFINS THE UNDERTAKER'S WIFE BEAT HIM OFTEN AND WHENEVER HE WAS NOT AT WORK HE HAD TO ATTEND FUNERALS
7883-113274-0020 WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS AMUSING SO THAT HE FOUND LIFE NO BETTER THAN IT HAD BEEN AT THE WORKHOUSE THE UNDERTAKER HAD AN APPRENTICE TOO WHO KICKED HIM WHENEVER HE CAME NEAR
7883-113274-0021 ALL THIS WRETCHEDNESS OLIVER BORE AS WELL AS HE COULD WITHOUT COMPLAINING BUT ONE DAY THE COWARDLY APPRENTICE BEGAN TO SAY UNKIND THINGS OF OLIVER'S DEAD MOTHER AND THIS HE COULD NOT STAND
7883-113274-0022 HIS ANGER MADE HIM STRONGER EVEN THAN HIS TORMENTOR THOUGH THE LATTER WAS MORE THAN A HEAD TALLER AND MUCH OLDER AND HE SPRANG UPON HIM CAUGHT HIM BY THE THROAT AND AFTER SHAKING HIM TILL HIS TEETH RATTLED
7883-113274-0023 KNOCKED HIM FLAT ON THE FLOOR THE BIG BULLY SCREAMED FOR HELP AND CRIED THAT HE WAS BEING MURDERED SO THAT THE UNDERTAKER AND HIS WIFE CAME RUNNING IN OLIVER TOLD THEM WHAT THE APPRENTICE HAD SAID BUT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
7883-113274-0024 AND SENT HIM TO BED WITHOUT ANYTHING TO EAT TILL THEN OLIVER HAD NOT SHED A TEAR BUT NOW ALONE IN THE DARK HE FELT SO MISERABLE THAT HE CRIED FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO
7883-113274-0025 HE THOUGHT AT LAST BUT TO RUN AWAY SO HE TIED UP HIS FEW BELONGINGS IN A HANDKERCHIEF AND WAITING TILL THE FIRST BEAM OF SUNRISE HE UNBARRED THE DOOR
7883-113274-0026 AND RAN AWAY AS FAST AS HE COULD THROUGH THE TOWN INTO THE COUNTRY HE HID BEHIND HEDGES WHENEVER HE SAW ANYBODY FOR FEAR THE UNDERTAKER OR MISTER BUMBLE WERE AFTER HIM
7883-113274-0027 AND BEFORE LONG HE FOUND A ROAD THAT HE KNEW LED TO LONDON OLIVER HAD NEVER SEEN A CITY BUT HE THOUGHT WHERE THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THERE WOULD CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING FOR A BOY TO DO TO EARN HIS LIVING
7883-113274-0028 SO HE TRUDGED STOUTLY ON AND BEFORE NIGHTFALL HAD WALKED TWENTY MILES HE BEGGED A CRUST OF BREAD AT A COTTAGE AND SLEPT UNDER A HAYRICK THE NEXT DAY AND NIGHT HE WAS SO VERY HUNGRY AND COLD
7883-113274-0029 THAT WHEN MORNING CAME AGAIN HE COULD SCARCELY WALK AT ALL HE SAT DOWN FINALLY AT THE EDGE OF A VILLAGE WONDERING WHETHER HE WAS GOING TO DIE WHEN HE SAW COMING ALONG THE QUEEREST LOOKING BOY
7883-113274-0030 HE WAS ABOUT OLIVER'S AGE WITH A SNUB NOSE BOW LEGS AND LITTLE SHARP EYES
7883-113274-0031 WHOSE RAGGED TAILS CAME TO HIS HEELS THE BOY SAW OLIVER'S PLIGHT AND ASKED HIM WHAT THE MATTER WAS MIXING HIS WORDS WITH SUCH A LOT OF STRANGE SLANG THAT OLIVER COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND HIM
7883-113274-0032 WHEN OLIVER EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD BEEN WALKING A NUMBER OF DAYS AND WAS VERY HUNGRY THE OTHER TOOK HIM TO A SHOP NEAR BY BOUGHT HIM SOME BREAD AND HAM AND WATCHED HIM EAT IT WITH GREAT ATTENTION ASKING HIM MANY QUESTIONS
7883-113274-0033 WHETHER HE HAD ANY MONEY OR KNEW ANY PLACE IN LONDON WHERE HE COULD STAY OLIVER ANSWERED NO DON'T FRET ABOUT THAT SAID THE OTHER I KNOW A SPECTABLE OLD GENELMAN AS LIVES THERE WOT'LL GIVE YOU LODGINGS FOR NOTHING
7883-113274-0034 IF I INTERDUCE YOU OLIVER DID NOT THINK HIS NEW HOST LOOKED VERY RESPECTABLE HIMSELF BUT HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AS WELL FOR HIM TO KNOW THE OLD GENTLEMAN PARTICULARLY AS HE HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO
7883-113274-0035 SO THEY SET OFF IT WAS NIGHT WHEN THEY REACHED LONDON AND IT WAS SO BIG AND CROWDED THAT OLIVER KEPT CLOSE TO HIS GUIDE
7883-113274-0036 AND THE HOUSES OLD AND HIDEOUSLY FILTHY THE PEOPLE TOO SEEMED LOW AND WRETCHED HE WAS JUST WONDERING IF HE HAD NOT BETTER RUN AWAY WHEN THE BOY PUSHED OPEN A DOOR
7883-113274-0037 DREW OLIVER INSIDE UP A BROKEN STAIRWAY AND INTO A BACK ROOM HERE FRYING SOME SAUSAGES OVER A STOVE WAS A SHRIVELED OLD JEW IN A GREASY FLANNEL GOWN HE WAS VERY UGLY
7883-113274-0038 AND HIS MATTED RED HAIR HUNG DOWN OVER HIS VILLAINOUS FACE IN A CORNER STOOD A CLOTHES HORSE ON WHICH HUNG HUNDREDS OF SILK HANDKERCHIEFS AND FOUR OR FIVE BOYS AS DIRTY AND ODDLY DRESSED
7883-113274-0039 AS THE ONE WHO HAD BROUGHT OLIVER SAT ABOUT A TABLE SMOKING PIPES LIKE ROUGH GROWN MEN OLIVER'S GUIDE INTRODUCED HIM TO THE JEW WHOSE NAME WAS FAGIN
7883-113274-0040 AND THE BOYS CROWDED AROUND HIM PUTTING THEIR HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS WHICH HE THOUGHT A QUEER JOKE FAGIN GRINNED HORRIBLY AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND TOLD HIM HE WAS VERY WELCOME WHICH DID NOT TEND TO REASSURE HIM
7883-113274-0041 AND THEN THE SAUSAGES WERE PASSED AROUND THE JEW GAVE OLIVER A GLASS OF SOMETHING TO DRINK AND AS SOON AS HE DRANK IT HE BECAME VERY SLEEPY AND KNEW NOTHING MORE TILL THE FOLLOWING MORNING
7883-113274-0042 WHOM THEY CALLED THE ARTFUL DODGER CAME IN AND GAVE THE JEW SOME POCKETBOOKS AND HANDKERCHIEFS OLIVER THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE MADE THE POCKETBOOKS ONLY THEY DID NOT LOOK NEW AND SOME SEEMED TO HAVE MONEY IN THEM
7883-113274-0043 HE NOTICED TOO THAT WHENEVER THE ARTFUL DODGER CAME HOME EMPTY HANDED FAGIN SEEMED ANGRY AND CUFFED AND KICKED HIM AND SENT HIM TO BED SUPPERLESS BUT WHEN HE BROUGHT HOME A GOOD NUMBER EVERYTHING WAS VERY JOLLY
7883-113274-0044 WHENEVER THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO THE OLD JEW PLAYED A VERY CURIOUS GAME WITH THE BOYS THIS WAS THE WAY THEY PLAYED IT FAGIN WOULD PUT A SNUFF BOX IN ONE POCKET A WATCH IN ANOTHER AND A HANDKERCHIEF IN A THIRD
7883-113274-0045 THEN HE WOULD WALK ABOUT THE ROOM JUST AS ANY OLD GENTLEMAN WOULD WALK ABOUT THE STREET STOPPING NOW AND THEN AS IF HE WERE LOOKING INTO SHOP WINDOWS ALL THE TIME THE BOYS FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY SOMETIMES TREADING ON HIS TOES
7883-113274-0046 OR STUMBLING AGAINST HIM AND WHEN THIS HAPPENED ONE OF THEM WOULD SLIP A HAND INTO HIS POCKET AND TAKE OUT EITHER THE WATCH OR THE SNUFF BOX OR THE HANDKERCHIEF IF THE JEW FELT A HAND IN HIS POCKET HE CRIED OUT
7883-113274-0047 WHICH IT WAS AND THEN THE GAME BEGAN ALL OVER AGAIN AT LAST FAGIN MADE OLIVER TRY IF HE COULD TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIS POCKET WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT AND WHEN OLIVER SUCCEEDED HE PATTED HIS HEAD AND SEEMED WELL PLEASED
7883-113274-0048 BUT OLIVER GREW VERY TIRED OF THE DIRTY ROOM AND THE SAME GAME HE LONGED FOR THE OPEN AIR AND BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO GO OUT SO ONE DAY THE JEW PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF THE ARTFUL DODGER AND THEY WENT UPON THE STREETS
7883-113274-0049 OLIVER WONDERING WHERE IN THE WORLD HE WAS GOING TO BE TAUGHT TO MAKE POCKETBOOKS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING WHEN THE ARTFUL DODGER SIGNED TO HIM TO BE SILENT
7883-113274-0050 AND SLUNK BEHIND AN OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WAS READING A BOOK IN FRONT OF A BOOK STALL YOU CAN IMAGINE OLIVER'S HORROR WHEN HE SAW HIM THRUST HIS HAND INTO THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S POCKET
7883-113274-0051 DRAW OUT A SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND RUN OFF AT FULL SPEED IN AN INSTANT OLIVER UNDERSTOOD THE MYSTERY OF THE HANDKERCHIEFS THE WATCHES THE PURSES
7883-113274-0052 AND THE CURIOUS GAME HE HAD LEARNED AT FAGIN'S HE KNEW THEN THAT THE ARTFUL DODGER WAS A PICKPOCKET HE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT FOR A MINUTE HE LOST HIS WITS AND RAN OFF AS FAST AS HE COULD GO
7883-113274-0053 JUST THEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN FOUND HIS HANDKERCHIEF WAS GONE AND SEEING OLIVER RUNNING AWAY SHOUTED STOP THIEF WHICH FRIGHTENED THE POOR BOY EVEN MORE AND MADE HIM RUN ALL THE FASTER EVERYBODY JOINED THE CHASE
7883-113274-0054 A POLICEMAN WAS AT HAND AND HE WAS DRAGGED MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE TO THE POLICE COURT FOLLOWED BY THE ANGRY OLD GENTLEMAN THE MOMENT THE LATTER SAW THE BOY'S FACE
7883-113274-0055 HOWEVER HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WAS THE FACE OF A THIEF AND REFUSED TO APPEAR AGAINST HIM BUT THE MAGISTRATE WAS IN A BAD HUMOR AND WAS ABOUT TO SENTENCE OLIVER TO PRISON ANYWAY
7883-113274-0056 WHEN THE OWNER OF THE BOOK STALL CAME HURRYING IN HE HAD SEEN THE THEFT AND KNEW OLIVER WAS NOT GUILTY SO THE MAGISTRATE WAS OBLIGED TO LET HIM GO BUT THE TERROR AND THE BLOW HE HAD RECEIVED HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR OLIVER
7883-113274-0057 HE FELL DOWN IN A FAINT AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHOSE NAME WAS MISTER BROWNLOW OVERCOME WITH PITY PUT HIM INTO A COACH AND DROVE HIM TO HIS OWN HOME
