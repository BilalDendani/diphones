6981-70843-0044 THREATENING TO STRIKE IF BOTH SIDES DID NOT COMPROMISE THE CONQUERORS OF THESE RIOTS THE SAVIOURS OF THE WRECK OF OUR COUNTRY THESE WILL BE NEITHER THE BOLSHEVIKI NOR THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION NOR THE TROOPS OF KERENSKY BUT WE THE UNION OF RAILWAYMEN
6981-70843-0045 RED GUARDS ARE INCAPABLE OF HANDLING A COMPLICATED BUSINESS LIKE THE RAILWAYS AS FOR THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT IT HAS SHOWN ITSELF INCAPABLE OF HOLDING THE POWER WE REFUSE TO LEND OUR SERVICES TO ANY PARTY
6981-70843-0046 WHICH DOES NOT ACT BY AUTHORITY OF A GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE CONFIDENCE OF ALL THE DEMOCRACY SMOLNY THRILLED WITH THE BOUNDLESS VITALITY OF INEXHAUSTIBLE HUMANITY IN ACTION

6981-70843-0059 KAMENIEV ANSWERED DISCREETLY
6981-70843-0060 THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY HOWEVER LAY NOT IN COMPOSITION OF SUCH A GOVERNMENT BUT IN ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROGRAMME OF THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS

6981-70843-0071 ONLY FIVE THOUSAND REGULAR SOLDIERS HAD JOINED THEM THE REST OF THE GARRISON WAS EITHER BUSY SUPPRESSING THE YUNKER REVOLT GUARDING THE CITY OR UNDECIDED WHAT TO DO AT TEN IN THE EVENING LENIN ADDRESSED A MEETING OF DELEGATES FROM THE CITY REGIMENTS
6981-70843-0072 WHO VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO FIGHT A COMMITTEE OF FIVE SOLDIERS WAS ELECTED TO SERVE AS GENERAL STAFF AND IN THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING THE REGIMENTS LEFT THEIR BARRACKS IN FULL BATTLE ARRAY GOING HOME I SAW THEM PASS
6981-70843-0073 SWINGING ALONG WITH THE REGULAR TREAD OF VETERANS BAYONETS IN PERFECT ALIGNMENT THROUGH THE DESERTED STREETS OF THE CONQUERED CITY
6981-70843-0074 AFTER BITTER QUARRELLING A COMMISSION WAS ELECTED TO DRAW UP A WORKABLE PLAN ALL THAT NIGHT THE COMMISSION WRANGLED AND ALL THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT NIGHT ONCE BEFORE ON THE NINTH OF NOVEMBER
6981-70843-0075 THE RIGHT WING OF THE MENSHEVIKI SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND POPULIST SOCIALISTS SUDDENLY WITHDREW NOW THEY WERE AWED BY THE CRUSHING OF THE YUNKER REBELLION MONDAY THE TWELFTH WAS A DAY OF SUSPENSE
6981-70843-0076 THE EYES OF ALL RUSSIA WERE FIXED ON THE GREY PLAIN BEYOND THE GATES OF PETROGRAD WHERE ALL THE AVAILABLE STRENGTH OF THE OLD ORDER FACED THE UNORGANISED POWER OF THE NEW THE UNKNOWN IN MOSCOW A TRUCE HAD BEEN DECLARED BOTH SIDES PARLEYED
6981-70843-0077 AWAITING THE RESULT IN THE CAPITAL NOW THE DELEGATES TO THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HURRYING ON SPEEDING TRAINS TO THE FARTHEST REACHES OF ASIA WERE COMING TO THEIR HOMES CARRYING THE FIERY CROSS

6981-70843-0079 RED GUARDS AGAINST WHITE STREET FIGHTING AND PASSIONATE SPEECH THE RESULT WAITED ON THE WORD FROM PETROGRAD SMOLNY WAS ALMOST EMPTY BUT THE DUMA WAS THRONGED AND NOISY
6981-70843-0080 THE PEACEFUL POPULATION RECOGNISES THIS FACT THE FOREIGN EMBASSIES RECOGNISE ONLY SUCH DOCUMENTS AS ARE SIGNED BY THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN THE MIND OF A EUROPEAN DOES NOT ADMIT OF ANY OTHER SITUATION
6981-70843-0081 AS THE MUNICIPAL SELF GOVERNMENT IS THE ONLY ORGAN WHICH IS CAPABLE OF PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF THE CITIZENS THE CITY IS BOUND TO SHOW HOSPITALITY TO ALL ORGANISATIONS WHICH DESIRE TO PROFIT BY SUCH HOSPITALITY
6981-70843-0082 WHEN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS OCCUPIED BY THE YUNKERS COLONEL POLKOVNIKOV ORDERED THE TELEPHONES TO SMOLNY DISCONNECTED BUT I PROTESTED AND THE TELEPHONES WERE KEPT GOING AT THIS THERE WAS IRONIC LAUGHTER FROM THE BOLSHEVIK BENCHES
6981-70843-0083 AND IMPRECATIONS FROM THE RIGHT AND YET WENT ON SCHREIDER THEY LOOK UPON US AS COUNTER REVOLUTIONARIES AND REPORT US TO THE POPULATION THEY DEPRIVE US OF OUR MEANS OF TRANSPORT BY TAKING AWAY OUR LAST MOTOR CARS
6981-70843-0084 HAD REQUISITIONED THE MUNICIPAL AUTOMOBILES
6981-70843-0085 BUT EVERY MENSHEVIK AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY HERE TALKS NOTHING BUT PARTY PROPAGANDA AND AT THE DOOR THEY DISTRIBUTE THEIR ILLEGAL NEWSPAPERS ISKRI SPARKS SOLDATSKI GOLOS AND RABOTCHAYA GAZETA INCITING TO INSURRECTION
6981-70843-0086 WHAT IF WE BOLSHEVIKI SHOULD ALSO BEGIN TO DISTRIBUTE OUR PAPERS HERE BUT THIS SHALL NOT BE FOR WE RESPECT THE DUMA WE HAVE NOT ATTACKED THE MUNICIPAL SELF GOVERNMENT AND WE SHALL NOT DO SO BUT YOU HAVE ADDRESSED AN APPEAL TO THE POPULATION
6981-70843-0087 THEN TWO MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS DECLARING THAT THE APPEAL OF THE BOLSHEVIK COUNCILLORS WAS A DIRECT INCITEMENT TO MASSACRE IF EVERYTHING THAT IS AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI IS COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY SAID PINKEVITCH
6981-70843-0088 THEN I DO NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REVOLUTION AND ANARCHY THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE DEPENDING UPON THE PASSIONS OF THE UNBRIDLED MASSES WE HAVE NOTHING BUT MORAL FORCE WE WILL PROTEST AGAINST MASSACRES AND VIOLENCE FROM BOTH SIDES AS OUR TASK IS TO FIND A PEACEFUL ISSUE
6981-70843-0089 THE NOTICE POSTED IN THE STREETS UNDER THE HEADING TO THE PILLORY WHICH CALLS UPON THE PEOPLE TO DESTROY THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES SAID NAZARIEV IS A CRIME WHICH YOU BOLSHEVIKI WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WASH AWAY
6981-70843-0090 YESTERDAY'S HORRORS ARE BUT A PREFACE TO WHAT YOU ARE PREPARING BY SUCH A PROCLAMATION
6981-70843-0091 BUT AT PRESENT I FEEL FOR YOU NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT THE BOLSHEVIK COUNCILLORS WERE ON THEIR FEET SHOUTING ANGRILY ASSAILED BY HOARSE HATEFUL VOICES AND WAVING ARMS

6981-70843-0100 WITHOUT TAKING OFFENCE THE OFFICER REPLIED YES I KNOW BUT WHAT CAN WE DO HE SHRUGGED
6981-70843-0101 THE OTHER MAN INTERRUPTED THIS IS MERELY AN ADVENTURE ON THE PART OF THE BOLSHEVIKI THEY HAVE NO INTELLECTUALS THE MINISTRIES WON'T WORK RUSSIA IS NOT A CITY BUT A WHOLE COUNTRY

6981-70843-0103 WE HAVE NO FOLLOWING NOW WE CAN'T MOBILISE A HANDFUL OF SOLDIERS THERE ARE NO ARMS AVAILABLE
6981-70843-0104 THERE ARE AT THIS MOMENT IN RUSSIA ONLY TWO PARTIES WITH ANY FORCE
6981-70843-0105 WHO ARE ALL HIDING UNDER THE COAT TAILS OF THE CADETS
6981-70843-0106 WHEN WE SMASH THE BOLSHEVIKI WE SHALL TURN AGAINST THE CADETS
6981-70843-0107 HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THAT'S A PROBLEM HE ADMITTED OF COURSE IF THEY ARE NOT ADMITTED THEY'LL PROBABLY DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN
6981-70843-0108 THAT IS IF THERE IS A CONSTITUENT AND THEN TOO SAID THE OFFICER THAT BRINGS UP THE QUESTION OF ADMITTING THE CADETS INTO THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND FOR THE SAME REASONS YOU KNOW THE CADETS DO NOT REALLY WANT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY NOT IF THE BOLSHEVIKI CAN BE DESTROYED NOW
6981-70843-0109 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD IT IS NOT EASY FOR US RUSSIANS POLITICS YOU AMERICANS ARE BORN POLITICIANS YOU HAVE HAD POLITICS ALL YOUR LIVES BUT FOR US WELL IT HAS ONLY BEEN A YEAR YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF KERENSKY I ASKED

6981-70843-0112 VOTED UNANIMOUSLY AGAINST IT AND WHAT COULD I DO IT WAS A MATTER OF PARTY DISCIPLINE IN A WEEK THE BOLSHEVIK GOVERNMENT WILL GO TO PIECES IF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES COULD ONLY STAND ASIDE AND WAIT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD FALL INTO THEIR HANDS
6981-70843-0113 AT FIRST THEY SAID THEY WOULD COME OUT IF THEY HAD INFANTRY SUPPORT THEY SAID MOREOVER THAT THEY HAD THEIR MEN WITH KERENSKY AND THAT THEY WERE DOING THEIR PART
6981-70843-0114 AND FINALLY THE BOLSHEVIKI PROMISE THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE AWAY OUR LAND THERE IS NO DANGER TO US WE REMAIN NEUTRAL DURING THIS TALK PEOPLE WERE CONSTANTLY ENTERING AND LEAVING MOST OF THEM OFFICERS THEIR SHOULDER STRAPS TORN OFF
