6660-103647-0000 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE IVY SUMMER HOUSE ELEVEN O'CLOCK HE HAS NOT YET GOT MY LETTER
6660-103647-0001 THAT I MIGHT HAVE TIME FOR THE INTENDED INTERVIEW AND HAD HIT UPON AN EXPEDIENT WHICH I BELIEVE WOULD HAVE DONE CAME MY AUNT AND FURNISHED ME WITH A MUCH BETTER SHE SAW MY LITTLE TABLE COVERED PREPARATIVE TO MY SOLITARY DINNER AND HOPED SHE TOLD ME THAT THIS WOULD BE THE LAST DAY
6660-103647-0002 THAT MY FRIENDS WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF MY COMPANY AT TABLE YOU MAY BELIEVE MY DEAR THAT THE THOUGHTS OF MEETING MISTER LOVELACE FOR FEAR OF BEING DISCOVERED TOGETHER WITH THE CONTENTS OF MY COUSIN DOLLY'S LETTER GAVE ME GREAT AND VISIBLE EMOTIONS SHE TOOK NOTICE OF THEM
6660-103647-0003 WHY THESE SIGHS WHY THESE HEAVINGS HERE SAID SHE PATTING MY NECK O MY DEAR NIECE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO MUCH NATURAL SWEETNESS COULD BE SO VERY UNPERSUADABLE I COULD NOT ANSWER HER AND SHE PROCEEDED I AM COME I DOUBT UPON A VERY UNWELCOME ERRAND
6660-103647-0004 SOME THINGS HAVE BEEN TOLD US YESTERDAY WHICH CAME FROM THE MOUTH OF ONE OF THE MOST DESPERATE AND INSOLENT MEN IN THE WORLD CONVINCE YOUR FATHER AND ALL OF US THAT YOU STILL FIND MEANS TO WRITE OUT OF THE HOUSE MISTER LOVELACE KNOWS EVERY THING THAT IS DONE HERE AND THAT AS SOON AS DONE
6660-103647-0005 IT WILL BE THE BETTER TAKEN IF YOU GIVE ME CHEERFULLY YOUR KEYS I HOPE MY DEAR YOU WON'T DISPUTE IT YOUR DESIRE OF DINING IN THIS PLACE WAS THE MORE READILY COMPLIED WITH FOR THE SAKE OF SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY
6660-103647-0006 I THOUGHT MYSELF VERY LUCKY TO BE SO WELL PREPARED BY MY COUSIN DOLLY'S MEANS FOR THIS SEARCH BUT YET I ARTFULLY MADE SOME SCRUPLES AND NOT A FEW COMPLAINTS OF THIS TREATMENT AFTER WHICH I NOT ONLY GAVE HER THE KEYS OF ALL BUT EVEN OFFICIOUSLY EMPTIED MY POCKETS BEFORE HER
6660-103647-0007 IT BEING SHE SAID HIS CUSTOM BOASTINGLY TO PRATE TO HIS VERY SERVANTS OF HIS INTENTIONS IN PARTICULAR CASES SHE ADDED THAT DEEP AS HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE MY BROTHER WAS AS DEEP AS HE AND FAIRLY TOO HARD FOR HIM AT HIS OWN WEAPONS AS ONE DAY IT WOULD BE FOUND
6660-103647-0008 I KNEW NOT I SAID THE MEANING OF THESE DARK HINTS I THOUGHT THE CUNNING SHE HINTED AT ON BOTH SIDES CALLED RATHER FOR CONTEMPT THAN APPLAUSE I MYSELF MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUT UPON ARTIFICES WHICH MY HEART DISDAINED TO PRACTISE HAD I GIVEN WAY TO THE RESENTMENT WHICH I WAS BOLD TO SAY
6660-103647-0009 WAS MUCH MORE JUSTIFIABLE THAN THE ACTIONS THAT OCCASIONED IT THAT IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME FROM WHAT SHE HAD SAID THAT THEIR PRESENT SUSPICIONS OF ME WERE PARTLY OWING TO THIS SUPPOSED SUPERIOR CUNNING OF MY BROTHER AND PARTLY TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE USAGE I MET WITH MIGHT NATURALLY PRODUCE A REASON FOR SUCH SUSPICIONS
6660-103647-0010 THAT IT WAS VERY UNHAPPY FOR ME TO BE MADE THE BUTT OF MY BROTHER'S WIT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS PRAISE TO HAVE AIMED AT SHEWING A KIND HEART THAN A CUNNING HEAD THAT NEVERTHELESS I WISHED HE KNEW HIMSELF AS WELL AS I IMAGINED I KNEW HIM AND HE WOULD THEN HAVE LESS CONCEIT OF HIS ABILITIES
6660-103647-0011 WHICH ABILITIES WOULD IN MY OPINION BE LESS THOUGHT OF IF HIS POWER TO DO ILL OFFICES WERE NOT MUCH GREATER THAN THEY I WAS VEXED I COULD NOT HELP MAKING THIS REFLECTION THE DUPE THE OTHER TOO PROBABLY MAKES OF HIM THROUGH HIS OWN SPY DESERVED IT
6660-103647-0012 BUT I SO LITTLE APPROVE OF THIS LOW ART IN EITHER THAT WERE I BUT TOLERABLY USED THE VILENESS OF THAT MAN THAT JOSEPH LEMAN SHOULD BE INQUIRED INTO SHE WAS SORRY SHE SAID TO FIND THAT I THOUGHT SO DISPARAGINGLY OF MY BROTHER HE WAS A YOUNG MAN BOTH OF LEARNING AND PARTS
6660-103647-0013 LEARNING ENOUGH I SAID TO MAKE HIM VAIN OF IT AMONG US WOMEN BUT NOT OF PARTS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE HIS LEARNING VALUABLE EITHER TO HIMSELF OR TO ANY BODY ELSE SHE WISHED INDEED THAT HE HAD MORE GOOD NATURE
6660-103647-0014 BUT SHE FEARED THAT I HAD TOO GREAT AN OPINION OF SOMEBODY ELSE TO THINK SO WELL OF MY BROTHER AS A SISTER OUGHT SINCE BETWEEN THE TWO THERE WAS A SORT OF RIVALRY AS TO ABILITIES THAT MADE THEM HATE ONE ANOTHER RIVALRY MADAM SAID I IF THAT BE THE CASE OR WHETHER IT BE OR NOT
6660-103647-0015 I WISH THEY BOTH UNDERSTOOD BETTER THAN EITHER OF THEM SEEM TO DO WHAT IT BECOMES GENTLEMEN AND MEN OF LIBERAL EDUCATION TO BE AND TO DO NEITHER OF THEM THEN WOULD GLORY IN WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF
6660-103647-0016 BUT WAVING THIS SUBJECT IT WAS NOT IMPOSSIBLE I SAID THAT THEY MIGHT FIND A LITTLE OF MY WRITING AND A PEN OR TWO AND A LITTLE INK HATED ART OR RATHER HATEFUL THE NECESSITY FOR IT AS I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO GO UP TO PUT THEM OUT OF THE WAY BUT IF THEY DID I MUST BE CONTENTED
6660-103647-0017 AND I ASSURED HER THAT TAKE WHAT TIME THEY PLEASED I WOULD NOT GO IN TO DISTURB THEM BUT WOULD BE EITHER IN OR NEAR THE GARDEN IN THIS SUMMER HOUSE OR IN THE CEDAR ONE OR ABOUT MY POULTRY YARD OR NEAR THE GREAT CASCADE TILL I WAS ORDERED TO RETURN TO MY PRISON WITH LIKE CUNNING I SAID
6660-103647-0018 I SUPPOSED THE UNKIND SEARCH WOULD NOT BE MADE TILL THE SERVANTS HAD DINED BECAUSE I DOUBTED NOT THAT THE PERT BETTY BARNES WHO KNEW ALL THE CORNERS OF MY APARTMENT AND CLOSET WOULD BE EMPLOYED IN IT SHE HOPED SHE SAID THAT NOTHING COULD BE FOUND THAT WOULD GIVE A HANDLE AGAINST ME FOR SHE WOULD ASSURE ME
6660-103647-0019 THE MOTIVES TO THE SEARCH ON MY MOTHER'S PART ESPECIALLY WERE THAT SHE HOPED TO FIND REASON RATHER TO ACQUIT THAN TO BLAME ME
6660-103647-0020 OR WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH TEMPER WITH TENDERNESS I SHOULD RATHER SAY SAID SHE FOR HE IS RESOLVED TO DO SO IF NO NEW OFFENCE BE GIVEN AH MADAM SAID I WHY THAT AH MADAM AND SHAKING YOUR HEAD SO SIGNIFICANTLY
6660-103647-0021 I WISH MADAM THAT I MAY NOT HAVE MORE REASON TO DREAD MY FATHER'S CONTINUED DISPLEASURE THAN TO HOPE FOR HIS RETURNING TENDERNESS YOU DON'T KNOW MY DEAR THINGS MAY TAKE A TURN THINGS MAY NOT BE SO BAD AS YOU FEAR DEAREST MADAM
6660-103647-0022 HAVE YOU ANY CONSOLATION TO GIVE ME WHY MY DEAR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MAY BE MORE COMPLIABLE THAN YOU HAVE BEEN WHY RAISED YOU MY HOPES MADAM
6660-103647-0023 CRUEL TO A NIECE WHO TRULY HONOURS HER I MAY TELL YOU MORE PERHAPS SAID SHE BUT IN CONFIDENCE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IF THE INQUIRY WITHIN CAME OUT IN YOUR FAVOUR
6660-103647-0024 SOME PAPERS THEY WILL FIND I DOUBT BUT I MUST TAKE CONSEQUENCES MY BROTHER AND SISTER WILL BE AT HAND WITH THEIR GOOD NATURED CONSTRUCTIONS
6660-103647-0025 I HOPE I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT NOTHING CAN BE FOUND THAT WILL IMPEACH YOUR DISCRETION AND THEN BUT I MAY SAY TOO MUCH AND AWAY SHE WENT HAVING ADDED TO MY PERPLEXITY BUT I NOW CAN THINK OF NOTHING BUT THIS INTERVIEW WOULD TO HEAVEN IT WERE OVER

6660-103647-0027 BUT AFTER ALL SHOULD I OUGHT I TO MEET HIM HOW HAVE I TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT I SHOULD I WISH THERE WERE TIME TO TAKE YOUR ADVICE YET YOU ARE SO LOTH TO SPEAK QUITE OUT BUT THAT I OWE AS YOU OWN TO THE DIFFICULTY OF MY SITUATION
6660-103647-0028 I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT IN THE COURSE OF THIS CONVERSATION I BESOUGHT MY AUNT TO STAND MY FRIEND AND TO PUT IN A WORD FOR ME ON MY APPROACHING TRIAL AND TO ENDEAVOUR TO PROCURE ME TIME FOR CONSIDERATION IF I COULD OBTAIN NOTHING ELSE SHE TOLD ME THAT AFTER THE CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED
6660-103647-0029 ODIOUS CONFIRMATION OF A HINT IN MY COUSIN DOLLY'S LETTER I SHOULD HAVE WHAT TIME I PLEASED TO RECONCILE MYSELF TO MY LOT BEFORE COHABITATION THIS PUT ME OUT OF ALL PATIENCE SHE REQUESTED OF ME IN HER TURN SHE SAID THAT I WOULD RESOLVE TO MEET THEM ALL WITH CHEERFUL DUTY
6660-103647-0030 AND WITH A SPIRIT OF ABSOLUTE ACQUIESCENCE IT WAS IN MY POWER TO MAKE THEM ALL HAPPY AND HOW JOYFUL WOULD IT BE TO HER SHE SAID TO SEE MY FATHER MY MOTHER MY UNCLES MY BROTHER MY SISTER ALL EMBRACING ME WITH RAPTURES AND FOLDING ME IN TURNS TO THEIR FOND HEARTS
6660-103647-0031 WILL YOU DOUBT MY DEAR THAT MY NEXT TRIAL WILL BE THE MOST AFFECTING THAT I HAVE YET HAD MY AUNT SET FORTH ALL THIS IN SO STRONG A LIGHT AND I WAS SO PARTICULARLY TOUCHED ON MY COUSIN DOLLY'S ACCOUNT THAT IMPATIENT AS I WAS JUST BEFORE I WAS GREATLY MOVED
6660-103647-0032 YET COULD ONLY SHEW BY MY SIGHS AND MY TEARS HOW DESIRABLE SUCH AN EVENT WOULD BE TO ME COULD IT BE BROUGHT ABOUT UPON CONDITIONS WITH WHICH IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO COMPLY HERE COMES BETTY BARNES WITH MY DINNER THE WENCH IS GONE THE TIME OF MEETING IS AT HAND
6660-103647-0033 O THAT HE MAY NOT COME BUT SHOULD I OR SHOULD I NOT MEET HIM HOW I QUESTION WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF A TIMELY ANSWER BETTY ACCORDING TO MY LEADING HINT TO MY AUNT BOASTED TO ME THAT SHE WAS TO BE EMPLOYED AS SHE CALLED IT AFTER SHE HAD EAT HER OWN DINNER

6660-103647-0035 AND ON HER RETURN TO TAKE AWAY AS I ANGRILY BID HER SHE BEGGED MY EXCUSE BUT BUT AND THEN THE SAUCY CREATURE LAUGHED AGAIN SHE COULD NOT HELP IT TO THINK HOW I HAD DRAWN MYSELF IN BY MY SUMMER HOUSE DINNERING SINCE IT HAD GIVEN SO FINE AN OPPORTUNITY
6660-103647-0036 BY WAY OF SURPRISE TO LOOK INTO ALL MY PRIVATE HOARDS SHE THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS IN THE WIND WHEN MY BROTHER CAME INTO MY DINING HERE SO READILY HER YOUNG MASTER WAS TOO HARD FOR EVERY BODY SQUIRE LOVELACE HIMSELF WAS NOTHING AT ALL AT A QUICK THOUGHT TO HER YOUNG MASTER
6660-103647-0037 MY AUNT MENTIONED MISTER LOVELACE'S BOASTING BEHAVIOUR TO HIS SERVANTS PERHAPS HE MAY BE SO MEAN BUT AS TO MY BROTHER HE ALWAYS TOOK A PRIDE IN MAKING HIMSELF APPEAR TO BE A MAN OF PARTS AND LEARNING TO OUR OWN SERVANTS PRIDE AND MEANNESS I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT ARE AS NEARLY ALLIED
6660-103647-0038 AND AS CLOSE BORDERERS UPON EACH OTHER AS THE POET TELLS US WIT AND MADNESS ARE BUT WHY DO I TROUBLE YOU AND MYSELF AT SUCH A CRISIS WITH THESE IMPERTINENCES YET I WOULD FORGET IF I COULD THE NEAREST EVIL THE INTERVIEW
6660-103647-0039 BECAUSE MY APPREHENSIONS INCREASING AS THE HOUR IS AT HAND I SHOULD WERE MY INTENTIONS TO BE ENGROSSED BY THEM BE UNFIT TO SEE HIM IF HE DOES COME AND THEN HE WILL HAVE TOO MUCH ADVANTAGE OVER ME AS HE WILL HAVE SEEMING REASON TO REPROACH ME WITH CHANGE OF RESOLUTION
6660-103647-0040 THE UPBRAIDER YOU KNOW MY DEAR IS IN SOME SENSE A SUPERIOR WHILE THE UPBRAIDED IF WITH REASON UPBRAIDED MUST MAKE A FIGURE AS SPIRITLESS AS CONSCIOUS I KNOW THAT THIS WRETCH WILL IF HE CAN BE HIS OWN JUDGE AND MINE TOO BUT THE LATTER HE SHALL NOT BE
6660-103647-0041 I DARE SAY WE SHALL BE ALL TO PIECES BUT I DON'T CARE FOR THAT IT WOULD BE HARD IF I WHO HAVE HELD IT OUT SO STURDILY TO MY FATHER AND UNCLES SHOULD NOT BUT HE IS AT THE GARDEN DOOR I WAS MISTAKEN

6660-103647-0043 IF HE HAS NOT I WILL TAKE IT BACK AND SHEW HIM WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN THAT WILL BREAK THE ICE AS I MAY SAY AND SAVE ME MUCH CIRCUMLOCUTION AND REASONING AND A STEADY ADHERENCE TO THAT MY WRITTEN MIND IS ALL THAT WILL BE NECESSARY THE INTERVIEW MUST BE AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE
6660-103647-0044 FOR SHOULD IT BE DISCOVERED IT WOULD FURNISH A NEW AND STRONG PRETENCE FOR THE INTENDED EVIL OF WEDNESDAY NEXT PERHAPS I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO WRITE AGAIN ONE WHILE PERHAPS NOT TILL I AM THE MISERABLE PROPERTY OF THAT SOLMES BUT THAT SHALL NEVER NEVER BE WHILE I HAVE MY SENSES
