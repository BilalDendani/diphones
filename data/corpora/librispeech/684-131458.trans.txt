684-131458-0000 MILDENDO THE METROPOLIS OF LILLIPUT DESCRIBED TOGETHER WITH THE EMPEROR'S PALACE A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND A PRINCIPAL SECRETARY CONCERNING THE AFFAIRS OF THAT EMPIRE THE AUTHOR'S OFFERS TO SERVE THE EMPEROR IN HIS WARS
684-131458-0001 THE FIRST REQUEST I MADE
684-131458-0002 WAS THAT I MIGHT HAVE LICENSE TO SEE MILDENDO THE METROPOLIS WHICH THE EMPEROR EASILY GRANTED ME BUT WITH A SPECIAL CHARGE TO DO NO HURT EITHER TO THE INHABITANTS OR THEIR HOUSES
684-131458-0003 OF MY DESIGN TO VISIT THE TOWN THE WALL WHICH ENCOMPASSED IT IS TWO FEET AND A HALF HIGH AND AT LEAST ELEVEN INCHES BROAD SO THAT A COACH AND HORSES MAY BE DRIVEN VERY SAFELY ROUND IT AND IT IS FLANKED WITH STRONG TOWERS AT TEN FEET DISTANCE
684-131458-0004 I STEPPED OVER THE GREAT WESTERN GATE AND PASSED VERY GENTLY AND SIDLING THROUGH THE TWO PRINCIPAL STREETS ONLY IN MY SHORT WAISTCOAT FOR FEAR OF DAMAGING THE ROOFS AND EAVES OF THE HOUSES WITH THE SKIRTS OF MY COAT
684-131458-0005 I WALKED WITH THE UTMOST CIRCUMSPECTION TO AVOID TREADING ON ANY STRAGGLERS WHO MIGHT REMAIN IN THE STREETS ALTHOUGH THE ORDERS WERE VERY STRICT THAT ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KEEP IN THEIR HOUSES AT THEIR OWN PERIL
684-131458-0006 THE GARRET WINDOWS AND TOPS OF HOUSES WERE SO CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS THAT I THOUGHT IN ALL MY TRAVELS I HAD NOT SEEN A MORE POPULOUS PLACE
684-131458-0007 EACH SIDE OF THE WALL BEING FIVE HUNDRED FEET LONG THE TWO GREAT STREETS WHICH RUN ACROSS AND DIVIDE IT INTO FOUR QUARTERS ARE FIVE FEET WIDE THE LANES AND ALLEYS WHICH I COULD NOT ENTER BUT ONLY VIEW THEM AS I PASSED
684-131458-0008 ARE FROM TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN INCHES THE TOWN IS CAPABLE OF HOLDING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS THE HOUSES ARE FROM THREE TO FIVE STORIES THE SHOPS AND MARKETS WELL PROVIDED THE EMPEROR'S PALACE IS IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY
684-131458-0009 WHERE THE TWO GREAT STREETS MEET IT IS ENCLOSED BY A WALL OF TWO FEET HIGH AND TWENTY FEET DISTANCE FROM THE BUILDINGS I HAD HIS MAJESTY'S PERMISSION TO STEP OVER THIS WALL AND THE SPACE BEING SO WIDE BETWEEN THAT AND THE PALACE
684-131458-0010 I COULD EASILY VIEW IT ON EVERY SIDE THE OUTWARD COURT IS A SQUARE OF FORTY FEET AND INCLUDES TWO OTHER COURTS IN THE INMOST ARE THE ROYAL APARTMENTS WHICH I WAS VERY DESIROUS TO SEE
684-131458-0011 FROM ONE SQUARE INTO ANOTHER WERE BUT EIGHTEEN INCHES HIGH AND SEVEN INCHES WIDE NOW THE BUILDINGS OF THE OUTER COURT WERE AT LEAST FIVE FEET HIGH AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO STRIDE OVER THEM WITHOUT INFINITE DAMAGE TO THE PILE
684-131458-0012 THOUGH THE WALLS WERE STRONGLY BUILT OF HEWN STONE AND FOUR INCHES THICK AT THE SAME TIME THE EMPEROR HAD A GREAT DESIRE THAT I SHOULD SEE THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS PALACE BUT THIS I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO TILL THREE DAYS AFTER
684-131458-0013 WHICH I SPENT IN CUTTING DOWN WITH MY KNIFE SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES IN THE ROYAL PARK ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT FROM THE CITY OF THESE TREES I MADE TWO STOOLS EACH ABOUT THREE FEET HIGH
684-131458-0014 AND STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR MY WEIGHT THE PEOPLE HAVING RECEIVED NOTICE A SECOND TIME I WENT AGAIN THROUGH THE CITY TO THE PALACE WITH MY TWO STOOLS IN MY HANDS WHEN I CAME TO THE SIDE OF THE OUTER COURT I STOOD UPON ONE STOOL
684-131458-0015 AND TOOK THE OTHER IN MY HAND THIS I LIFTED OVER THE ROOF AND GENTLY SET IT DOWN ON THE SPACE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND COURT WHICH WAS EIGHT FEET WIDE I THEN STEPT OVER THE BUILDING VERY CONVENIENTLY FROM ONE STOOL TO THE OTHER
684-131458-0016 AND DREW UP THE FIRST AFTER ME WITH A HOOKED STICK
684-131458-0017 AND LYING DOWN UPON MY SIDE I APPLIED MY FACE TO THE WINDOWS OF THE MIDDLE STORIES WHICH WERE LEFT OPEN ON PURPOSE AND DISCOVERED THE MOST SPLENDID APARTMENTS THAT CAN BE IMAGINED THERE I SAW THE EMPRESS AND THE YOUNG PRINCES IN THEIR SEVERAL LODGINGS
684-131458-0018 WITH THEIR CHIEF ATTENDANTS ABOUT THEM HER IMPERIAL MAJESTY WAS PLEASED TO SMILE VERY GRACIOUSLY UPON ME AND GAVE ME OUT OF THE WINDOW HER HAND TO KISS BUT I SHALL NOT ANTICIPATE THE READER WITH FURTHER DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS KIND
684-131458-0019 BECAUSE I RESERVE THEM FOR A GREATER WORK WHICH IS NOW ALMOST READY FOR THE PRESS CONTAINING A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS EMPIRE FROM ITS FIRST ERECTION THROUGH ALONG SERIES OF PRINCES WITH A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THEIR WARS AND POLITICS
684-131458-0020 LAWS LEARNING AND RELIGION THEIR PLANTS AND ANIMALS THEIR PECULIAR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS WITH OTHER MATTERS VERY CURIOUS AND USEFUL MY CHIEF DESIGN AT PRESENT BEING ONLY TO RELATE SUCH EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS AS HAPPENED TO THE PUBLIC
684-131458-0021 ONE MORNING ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER I HAD OBTAINED MY LIBERTY RELDRESAL PRINCIPAL SECRETARY AS THEY STYLE HIM FOR PRIVATE AFFAIRS CAME TO MY HOUSE ATTENDED ONLY BY ONE SERVANT
684-131458-0022 AND DESIRED I WOULD GIVE HIM AN HOURS AUDIENCE WHICH I READILY CONSENTED TO
684-131458-0023 AS WELL AS OF THE MANY GOOD OFFICES HE HAD DONE ME DURING MY SOLICITATIONS AT COURT I OFFERED TO LIE DOWN THAT HE MIGHT THE MORE CONVENIENTLY REACH MY EAR BUT HE CHOSE RATHER TO LET ME HOLD HIM IN MY HAND DURING OUR CONVERSATION
684-131458-0024 SAID HE MIGHT PRETEND TO SOME MERIT IN IT BUT HOWEVER ADDED THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THINGS AT COURT
684-131458-0025 FOR SAID HE AS FLOURISHING A CONDITION AS WE MAY APPEAR TO BE IN TO FOREIGNERS WE LABOUR UNDER TWO MIGHTY EVILS A VIOLENT FACTION AT HOME AND THE DANGER OF AN INVASION
684-131458-0026 BUT HOWEVER THIS BE
684-131458-0027 AND ALL OFFICES IN THE GIFT OF THE CROWN AS YOU CANNOT BUT OBSERVE AND PARTICULARLY THAT HIS MAJESTY'S IMPERIAL HEELS ARE LOWER AT LEAST BY A DRURR THAN
684-131458-0028 AND TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT BECOME ME WHO WAS A FOREIGNER TO INTERFERE WITH PARTIES BUT I WAS READY WITH THE HAZARD OF MY LIFE
