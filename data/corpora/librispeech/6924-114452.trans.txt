6924-114452-0011 IS THERE NO JEALOUSY AMONG THEM OR DISAPPOINTMENT TO THAT ONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN ELECTED TO A MAGISTRACY OR TO ANY OTHER DIGNITY TO WHICH HE ASPIRES CAPTAIN CERTAINLY NOT FOR NO ONE WANTS EITHER NECESSARIES OR LUXURIES MOREOVER
6924-114452-0012 THE RACE IS MANAGED FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMMONWEALTH
6924-114452-0013 THAT IT IS NATURAL TO MAN TO RECOGNIZE HIS OFFSPRING AND TO EDUCATE THEM AND TO USE HIS WIFE AND HOUSE AND CHILDREN AS HIS OWN FOR THEY SAY THAT CHILDREN ARE BRED FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE SPECIES AND NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL PLEASURE AS SAINT THOMAS ALSO ASSERTS
6924-114452-0014 EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE CONSTITUENTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND SINCE INDIVIDUALS FOR THE MOST PART BRING FORTH CHILDREN WRONGLY AND EDUCATE THEM WRONGLY THEY CONSIDER THAT THEY REMOVE DESTRUCTION FROM THE STATE AND THEREFORE FOR THIS REASON WITH MOST SACRED FEAR
6924-114452-0015 THEY COMMIT THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILDREN WHO AS IT WERE ARE THE ELEMENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO THE CARE OF MAGISTRATES FOR THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT THAT OF A FEW AND THUS THEY DISTRIBUTE MALE AND FEMALE BREEDERS
6924-114452-0016 OF THE BEST NATURES ACCORDING TO PHILOSOPHICAL RULES PLATO THINKS
6924-114452-0017 LEST SOME MEN SEEING THAT THEY ARE KEPT AWAY FROM THE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN SHOULD RISE UP WITH ANGER AND HATRED AGAINST THE MAGISTRATES AND HE THINKS FURTHER THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT DESERVE COHABITATION WITH THE MORE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN SHOULD BE DECEIVED
6924-114452-0018 WHILE THE LOTS ARE BEING LED OUT OF THE CITY BY THE MAGISTRATES SO THAT AT ALL TIMES THE WOMEN WHO ARE SUITABLE SHOULD FALL TO THEIR LOT NOT THOSE WHOM THEY DESIRE THIS SHREWDNESS HOWEVER IS NOT NECESSARY AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE CITY OF THE SUN
6924-114452-0019 FOR WITH THEM DEFORMITY IS UNKNOWN WHEN THE WOMEN ARE EXERCISED THEY GET A CLEAR COMPLEXION AND BECOME STRONG OF LIMB
6924-114452-0020 SHE IS CONDEMNED TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT IF THE WOMEN SHOULD EVEN DESIRE THEM THEY HAVE NO FACILITY FOR DOING THESE THINGS FOR WHO INDEED WOULD GIVE THEM THIS FACILITY FURTHER
6924-114452-0021 THEY ASSERT THAT AMONG US ABUSES OF THIS KIND ARISE FROM THE LEISURE AND SLOTH OF WOMEN BY THESE MEANS THEY LOSE THEIR COLOR AND HAVE PALE COMPLEXIONS AND BECOME FEEBLE AND SMALL FOR THIS REASON THEY ARE WITHOUT PROPER COMPLEXIONS USE HIGH SANDALS
6924-114452-0022 AND BECOME BEAUTIFUL NOT FROM STRENGTH BUT FROM SLOTHFUL TENDERNESS AND THUS THEY RUIN THEIR OWN TEMPERS AND NATURES AND CONSEQUENTLY THOSE OF THEIR OFFSPRING FURTHERMORE IF AT ANY TIME A MAN IS TAKEN CAPTIVE WITH ARDENT LOVE FOR A CERTAIN WOMAN
6924-114452-0023 THE TWO ARE ALLOWED TO CONVERSE AND JOKE TOGETHER AND TO GIVE ONE ANOTHER GARLANDS OF FLOWERS OR LEAVES AND TO MAKE VERSES BUT IF THE RACE IS ENDANGERED
6924-114452-0024 MOREOVER THE LOVE BORN OF EAGER DESIRE IS NOT KNOWN AMONG THEM ONLY THAT BORN OF FRIENDSHIP DOMESTIC AFFAIRS AND PARTNERSHIPS ARE OF LITTLE ACCOUNT BECAUSE EXCEPTING THE SIGN OF HONOR EACH ONE RECEIVES WHAT HE IS IN NEED OF
6924-114452-0025 IT IS CUSTOMARY TO GIVE THE PLEASING GIFTS OF HONOR BEAUTIFUL WREATHS SWEET FOOD OR SPLENDID CLOTHES WHILE THEY ARE FEASTING
6924-114452-0026 BUT AT NIGHT OR OUTSIDE THE CITY THEY USE RED GARMENTS EITHER OF WOOL OR SILK THEY HATE BLACK AS THEY DO DUNG AND THEREFORE THEY DISLIKE THE JAPANESE WHO ARE FOND OF BLACK PRIDE THEY CONSIDER THE MOST EXECRABLE VICE
6924-114452-0027 AND ONE WHO ACTS PROUDLY IS CHASTISED WITH THE MOST RUTHLESS CORRECTION WHEREFORE NO ONE THINKS IT LOWERING
6924-114452-0028 ALL WORK THEY CALL DISCIPLINE AND THUS THEY SAY THAT IT IS HONORABLE TO GO ON FOOT TO DO ANY ACT OF NATURE TO SEE WITH THE EYE AND TO SPEAK WITH THE TONGUE AND WHEN THERE IS NEED THEY DISTINGUISH PHILOSOPHICALLY
