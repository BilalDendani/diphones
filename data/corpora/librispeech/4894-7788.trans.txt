4894-7788-0000 MAKE A LARGE BOOK A FOLIO BOSWELL
4894-7788-0001 MANY OF SHAKSPEARE'S PLAYS ARE THE WORSE FOR BEING ACTED
4894-7788-0002 WHAT SIR IS NOTHING GAINED BY DECORATION AND ACTION
4894-7788-0003 JOHNSON MY DEAR SIR HAD I MENTIONED HIM I MUST HAVE MENTIONED MANY MORE MISSUS PRITCHARD MISSUS CIBBER NAY AND MISTER CIBBER TOO
4894-7788-0004 I COULD NOT BEAR SUCH NONSENSE AND WOULD NOT LET HIM READ IT TO THE END
4894-7788-0005 BOSWELL BUT IS NOT THE FEAR OF DEATH NATURAL TO MAN JOHNSON
4894-7788-0006 HE THEN IN A LOW AND EARNEST TONE TALKED OF HIS MEDITATING UPON THE AWEFUL HOUR OF HIS OWN DISSOLUTION AND IN WHAT MANNER HE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF UPON THAT OCCASION I KNOW NOT SAID HE
4894-7788-0007 WHETHER I SHOULD WISH TO HAVE A FRIEND BY ME OR HAVE IT ALL BETWEEN GOD AND MYSELF TALKING OF OUR FEELING FOR THE DISTRESSES OF OTHERS JOHNSON
4894-7788-0008 I SHOULD DO WHAT I COULD TO BAIL HIM AND GIVE HIM ANY OTHER ASSISTANCE BUT IF HE WERE ONCE FAIRLY HANGED I SHOULD NOT SUFFER BOSWELL WOULD YOU EAT YOUR DINNER THAT DAY SIR
4894-7788-0009 RECOMMENDING TO HIM AN INDUSTRIOUS YOUNG MAN WHO KEPT A PICKLE SHOP JOHNSON AY SIR HERE YOU HAVE A SPECIMEN OF HUMAN SYMPATHY A FRIEND HANGED AND A CUCUMBER PICKLED
4894-7788-0010 WE KNOW NOT WHETHER BARETTI OR THE PICKLE MAN HAS KEPT DAVIES FROM SLEEP NOR DOES HE KNOW HIMSELF AND AS TO HIS NOT SLEEPING SIR TOM DAVIES IS A VERY GREAT MAN TOM HAS BEEN UPON THE STAGE AND KNOWS HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS
4894-7788-0011 I HAVE NOT BEEN UPON THE STAGE AND CANNOT DO THOSE THINGS BOSWELL I HAVE OFTEN BLAMED MYSELF SIR FOR NOT FEELING FOR OTHERS AS SENSIBLY AS MANY SAY THEY DO JOHNSON SIR DON'T BE DUPED BY THEM ANY MORE
4894-7788-0012 YOU WILL FIND THESE VERY FEELING PEOPLE ARE NOT VERY READY TO DO YOU GOOD THEY PAY YOU BY FEELING BOSWELL FOOTE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF HUMOUR JOHNSON YES SIR BOSWELL
4894-7788-0013 IT IS WHAT OTHERS ABSTAIN FROM IT IS NOT COMEDY WHICH EXHIBITS THE CHARACTER OF A SPECIES AS THAT OF A MISER GATHERED FROM MANY MISERS IT IS FARCE WHICH EXHIBITS INDIVIDUALS BOSWELL
4894-7788-0014 JOHNSON I DO NOT KNOW SIR THAT THE FELLOW IS AN INFIDEL BUT IF HE BE AN INFIDEL HE IS AN INFIDEL AS A DOG IS AN INFIDEL
4894-7788-0015 I SUPPOSE SIR HE HAS THOUGHT SUPERFICIALLY AND SEIZED THE FIRST NOTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIS MIND JOHNSON WHY THEN SIR STILL HE IS LIKE A DOG
4894-7788-0016 HE AGAIN TALKED OF THE PASSAGE IN CONGREVE WITH HIGH COMMENDATION AND SAID SHAKSPEARE NEVER HAS SIX LINES TOGETHER WITHOUT A FAULT PERHAPS YOU MAY FIND SEVEN BUT THIS DOES NOT REFUTE MY GENERAL ASSERTION
4894-7788-0017 IF I COME TO AN ORCHARD AND SAY THERE'S NO FRUIT HERE AND THEN COMES A PORING MAN
4894-7788-0018 NEXT DAY OCTOBER TWENTIETH HE APPEARED FOR THE ONLY TIME I SUPPOSE IN HIS LIFE AS A WITNESS IN A COURT OF JUSTICE
4894-7788-0019 JOHNSON GAVE HIS EVIDENCE IN A SLOW DELIBERATE AND DISTINCT MANNER WHICH WAS UNCOMMONLY IMPRESSIVE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MISTER BARETTI WAS ACQUITTED ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF OCTOBER WE DINED TOGETHER AT THE MITRE TAVERN I FOUND FAULT WITH FOOTE
4894-7788-0020 FOR INDULGING HIS TALENT OF RIDICULE AT THE EXPENCE OF HIS VISITORS WHICH I COLLOQUIALLY TERMED MAKING FOOLS OF HIS COMPANY JOHNSON WHY SIR WHEN YOU GO TO SEE FOOTE YOU DO NOT GO TO SEE A SAINT
4894-7788-0021 WHO WILL ENTERTAIN YOU AT HIS HOUSE FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OF BRINGING YOU ON A PUBLICK STAGE SIR HE DOES NOT MAKE FOOLS OF HIS COMPANY THEY WHOM HE EXPOSES ARE FOOLS ALREADY HE ONLY BRINGS THEM INTO ACTION TALKING OF TRADE
4894-7788-0022 HE OBSERVED IT IS A MISTAKEN NOTION THAT A VAST DEAL OF MONEY IS BROUGHT INTO A NATION BY TRADE IT IS NOT SO COMMODITIES COME FROM COMMODITIES BUT TRADE PRODUCES NO CAPITAL ACCESSION OF WEALTH HOWEVER
4894-7788-0023 THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE PROFIT IN MONEY THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE PROFIT IN PLEASURE AS IT GIVES TO ONE NATION THE PRODUCTIONS OF ANOTHER
4894-7788-0024 BOSWELL YES SIR AND THERE IS A PROFIT IN PLEASURE BY ITS FURNISHING OCCUPATION TO SUCH NUMBERS OF MANKIND JOHNSON
4894-7788-0025 A THING WHICH MEN DISLIKE BEFORE THEY HAVE TRIED IT AND WHEN THEY HAVE TRIED IT BOSWELL BUT SIR THE MIND MUST BE EMPLOYED AND WE GROW WEARY WHEN IDLE JOHNSON THAT IS SIR BECAUSE OTHERS BEING BUSY WE WANT COMPANY
4894-7788-0026 BUT IF WE WERE ALL IDLE THERE WOULD BE NO GROWING WEARY WE SHOULD ALL ENTERTAIN ONE ANOTHER THERE IS INDEED THIS IN TRADE IT GIVES MEN AN OPPORTUNITY OF IMPROVING THEIR SITUATION IF THERE WERE NO TRADE MANY WHO ARE POOR WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN POOR
4894-7788-0027 MEDICATED BATHS CAN BE NO BETTER THAN WARM WATER THEIR ONLY EFFECT CAN BE THAT OF TEPID MOISTURE ONE OF THE COMPANY TOOK THE OTHER SIDE MAINTAINING THAT MEDICINES OF VARIOUS SORTS AND SOME TOO OF MOST POWERFUL EFFECT
4894-7788-0028 ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE HUMAN FRAME BY THE MEDIUM OF THE PORES AND THEREFORE WHEN WARM WATER IS IMPREGNATED WITH SALUTIFEROUS SUBSTANCES IT MAY PRODUCE GREAT EFFECTS AS A BATH THIS APPEARED TO ME VERY SATISFACTORY JOHNSON
4894-7788-0029 DID NOT ANSWER IT BUT TALKING FOR VICTORY AND DETERMINED TO BE MASTER OF THE FIELD HE HAD RECOURSE TO THE DEVICE WHICH GOLDSMITH IMPUTED TO HIM IN THE WITTY WORDS OF ONE OF CIBBER'S COMEDIES
4894-7788-0030 THERE IS NO ARGUING WITH JOHNSON FOR WHEN HIS PISTOL MISSES FIRE HE KNOCKS YOU DOWN WITH THE BUTT END OF IT HE TURNED TO THE GENTLEMAN
4894-7788-0031 BUT BE SURE THAT THE STEAM BE DIRECTED TO THY HEAD FOR THAT IS THE PECCANT PART THIS PRODUCED A TRIUMPHANT ROAR OF LAUGHTER FROM THE MOTLEY ASSEMBLY OF PHILOSOPHERS PRINTERS AND DEPENDENTS MALE AND FEMALE
4894-7788-0032 I KNOW NOT HOW SO WHIMSICAL A THOUGHT CAME INTO MY MIND BUT I ASKED IF SIR YOU WERE SHUT UP IN A CASTLE AND A NEWBORN CHILD WITH YOU WHAT WOULD YOU DO JOHNSON WHY SIR I SHOULD NOT MUCH LIKE MY COMPANY
4894-7788-0033 BOSWELL BUT WOULD YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE OF REARING IT
4894-7788-0034 BUT UPON MY PERSEVERING IN MY QUESTION REPLIED WHY YES SIR I WOULD BUT I MUST HAVE ALL CONVENIENCIES IF I HAD NO GARDEN I WOULD MAKE A SHED ON THE ROOF AND TAKE IT THERE FOR FRESH AIR I SHOULD FEED IT
4894-7788-0035 AND WASH IT MUCH AND WITH WARM WATER TO PLEASE IT NOT WITH COLD WATER TO GIVE IT PAIN BOSWELL BUT SIR DOES NOT HEAT RELAX JOHNSON SIR YOU ARE NOT TO IMAGINE THE WATER IS TO BE VERY HOT I WOULD NOT CODDLE THE CHILD
4894-7788-0036 NO SIR THE HARDY METHOD OF TREATING CHILDREN DOES NO GOOD I'LL TAKE YOU FIVE CHILDREN FROM LONDON WHO SHALL CUFF FIVE HIGHLAND CHILDREN SIR A MAN BRED IN LONDON WILL CARRY A BURTHEN OR RUN OR WRESTLE
4894-7788-0037 JOHNSON WHY SIR I DON'T KNOW THAT IT DOES
4894-7788-0038 HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP UPON POTATOES QUANTITY MAKES UP FOR QUALITY BOSWELL WOULD YOU TEACH THIS CHILD THAT I HAVE FURNISHED YOU WITH ANY THING JOHNSON NO I SHOULD NOT BE APT TO TEACH IT BOSWELL
4894-7788-0039 WOULD NOT YOU HAVE A PLEASURE IN TEACHING IT JOHNSON NO SIR I SHOULD NOT HAVE A PLEASURE IN TEACHING IT BOSWELL HAVE YOU NOT A PLEASURE IN TEACHING MEN THERE I HAVE YOU YOU HAVE THE SAME PLEASURE IN TEACHING MEN THAT I SHOULD HAVE IN TEACHING CHILDREN
4894-7788-0040 RUSSIA BEING MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BECOME A GREAT EMPIRE BY THE RAPID INCREASE OF POPULATION JOHNSON WHY SIR I SEE NO PROSPECT OF THEIR PROPAGATING MORE
4894-7788-0041 THEY CAN HAVE NO MORE CHILDREN THAN THEY CAN GET I KNOW OF NO WAY TO MAKE THEM BREED MORE THAN THEY DO IT IS NOT FROM REASON AND PRUDENCE THAT PEOPLE MARRY BUT FROM INCLINATION A MAN IS POOR HE THINKS I CANNOT BE WORSE AND SO I'LL E E N TAKE PEGGY BOSWELL
4894-7788-0042 BUT HAVE NOT NATIONS BEEN MORE POPULOUS AT ONE PERIOD THAN ANOTHER JOHNSON YES SIR BUT THAT HAS BEEN OWING TO THE PEOPLE BEING LESS THINNED AT ONE PERIOD THAN ANOTHER WHETHER BY EMIGRATIONS WAR OR PESTILENCE NOT BY THEIR BEING MORE OR LESS PROLIFICK
4894-7788-0043 BIRTHS AT ALL TIMES BEAR THE SAME PROPORTION TO THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE BOSWELL BUT TO CONSIDER THE STATE OF OUR OWN COUNTRY
4894-7788-0044 THOUGH THE PEOPLE MAY BE DISPOSED OF IN DIFFERENT WAYS WE SEE IF CORN BE DEAR AND BUTCHERS MEAT CHEAP THE FARMERS ALL APPLY THEMSELVES TO THE RAISING OF CORN TILL IT BECOMES PLENTIFUL AND CHEAP AND THEN BUTCHERS MEAT BECOMES DEAR
4894-7788-0045 SO THAT AN EQUALITY IS ALWAYS PRESERVED NO SIR LET FANCIFUL MEN DO AS THEY WILL DEPEND UPON IT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTURB THE SYSTEM OF LIFE BOSWELL BUT SIR
4894-7788-0046 IS IT NOT A VERY BAD THING FOR LANDLORDS TO OPPRESS THEIR TENANTS BY RAISING THEIR RENTS JOHNSON VERY BAD BUT SIR IT NEVER CAN HAVE ANY GENERAL INFLUENCE IT MAY DISTRESS SOME INDIVIDUALS FOR CONSIDER THIS LANDLORDS CANNOT DO WITHOUT TENANTS
4894-7788-0047 NOW TENANTS WILL NOT GIVE MORE FOR LAND THAN LAND IS WORTH IF THEY CAN MAKE MORE OF THEIR MONEY BY KEEPING A SHOP OR ANY OTHER WAY THEY'LL DO IT
4894-7788-0048 IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY GET TENANTS LAND IN ENGLAND IS AN ARTICLE OF COMMERCE A TENANT WHO PAYS HIS LANDLORD HIS RENT THINKS HIMSELF NO MORE OBLIGED TO HIM THAN YOU THINK YOURSELF OBLIGED TO A MAN IN WHOSE SHOP YOU BUY A PIECE OF GOODS
4894-7788-0049 HE KNOWS THE LANDLORD DOES NOT LET HIM HAVE HIS LAND FOR LESS THAN HE CAN GET FROM OTHERS IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE SHOPKEEPER SELLS HIS GOODS NO SHOPKEEPER SELLS A YARD OF RIBBAND FOR SIXPENCE WHEN SEVEN PENCE IS THE CURRENT PRICE BOSWELL
4894-7788-0050 BUT SIR IS IT NOT BETTER THAT TENANTS SHOULD BE DEPENDANT ON LANDLORDS JOHNSON WHY SIR AS THERE ARE MANY MORE TENANTS THAN LANDLORDS PERHAPS STRICTLY SPEAKING WE SHOULD WISH NOT
4894-7788-0051 BUT IF YOU PLEASE YOU MAY LET YOUR LANDS CHEAP AND SO GET THE VALUE PART IN MONEY AND PART IN HOMAGE I SHOULD AGREE WITH YOU IN THAT BOSWELL SO SIR YOU LAUGH AT SCHEMES OF POLITICAL IMPROVEMENT JOHNSON
4894-7788-0052 WHY SIR MOST SCHEMES OF POLITICAL IMPROVEMENT ARE VERY LAUGHABLE THINGS HE OBSERVED PROVIDENCE HAS WISELY ORDERED THAT THE MORE NUMEROUS MEN ARE THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM TO AGREE IN ANY THING AND SO THEY ARE GOVERNED
4894-7788-0053 THEY COULD EASILY DO IT WERE IT NOT THAT THEY CAN'T AGREE SO THE COMMON SOLDIERS
4894-7788-0054 ARE GOVERNED BY THEM FOR THE SAME REASON HE SAID MANKIND HAVE A STRONG ATTACHMENT TO THE HABITATIONS TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED YOU SEE THE INHABITANTS OF NORWAY DO NOT WITH ONE CONSENT QUIT IT
4894-7788-0055 NO SIR THEIR AFFECTION FOR THEIR OLD DWELLINGS AND THE TERROUR OF A GENERAL CHANGE KEEP THEM AT HOME THUS WE SEE MANY OF THE FINEST SPOTS IN THE WORLD THINLY INHABITED AND MANY RUGGED SPOTS WELL INHABITED
4894-7788-0056 BEING BROUGHT THE OFFICE OF READING IT ALOUD WAS ASSIGNED TO ME I WAS DIVERTED BY HIS IMPATIENCE HE MADE ME PASS OVER SO MANY PARTS OF IT THAT MY TASK WAS VERY EASY
4894-7788-0057 JOHNSON WHY NO SIR IF HE HAS NO OBJECTION YOU CAN HAVE NONE BOSWELL SO SIR YOU ARE NO GREAT ENEMY TO THE ROMAN CATHOLICK RELIGION JOHNSON NO MORE SIR THAN TO THE PRESBYTERIAN RELIGION BOSWELL YOU ARE JOKING
4894-7788-0058 JOHNSON NO SIR I REALLY THINK SO
4894-7788-0059 JOHNSON WHY SIR THE PRESBYTERIANS HAVE NO CHURCH NO APOSTOLICAL ORDINATION BOSWELL AND DO YOU THINK THAT ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL SIR JOHNSON WHY SIR AS IT WAS AN APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION I THINK IT IS DANGEROUS TO BE WITHOUT IT
4894-7788-0060 AND SIR THE PRESBYTERIANS HAVE NO PUBLIC WORSHIP THEY HAVE NO FORM OF PRAYER IN WHICH THEY KNOW THEY ARE TO JOIN THEY GO TO HEAR A MAN PRAY AND ARE TO JUDGE WHETHER THEY WILL JOIN WITH HIM BOSWELL BUT SIR THEIR DOCTRINE IS THE SAME WITH THAT OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
4894-7788-0061 THEIR CONFESSION OF FAITH AND THE THIRTY NINE ARTICLES CONTAIN THE SAME POINTS EVEN THE DOCTRINE OF PREDESTINATION JOHNSON WHY YES SIR PREDESTINATION WAS A PART OF THE CLAMOUR OF THE TIMES
4894-7788-0062 BOSWELL
4894-7788-0063 JOHNSON WHY SIR THAT IS A QUESTION WHICH HAS BEEN MUCH AGITATED
4894-7788-0064 OTHERS HAVE CONSIDERED THEM TO BE ONLY ARTICLES OF PEACE
4894-7788-0065 IT APPEARS TO ME SIR THAT PREDESTINATION OR WHAT IS EQUIVALENT TO IT CANNOT BE AVOIDED
4894-7788-0066 JOHNSON WHY SIR DOES NOT GOD EVERY DAY SEE THINGS GOING ON WITHOUT PREVENTING THEM BOSWELL TRUE SIR BUT IF A THING BE CERTAINLY FORESEEN IT MUST BE FIXED AND CANNOT HAPPEN OTHERWISE
4894-7788-0067 AND IF WE APPLY THIS CONSIDERATION TO THE HUMAN MIND THERE IS NO FREE WILL
4894-7788-0068 HE MENTIONED DOCTOR CLARKE AND BISHOP BRAMHALL ON LIBERTY AND NECESSITY AND BID ME READ SOUTH'S SERMONS ON PRAYER BUT AVOIDED THE QUESTION WHICH HAS EXCRUCIATED PHILOSOPHERS AND DIVINES BEYOND ANY OTHER
4894-7788-0069 I DID NOT PRESS IT FURTHER
4894-7788-0070 OF AN ATTRIBUTE USUALLY ASCRIBED TO THE DIVINITY HOWEVER IRRECONCILABLE IN ITS FULL EXTENT WITH THE GRAND SYSTEM OF MORAL GOVERNMENT HIS SUPPOSED ORTHODOXY HERE CRAMPED THE VIGOROUS POWERS OF HIS UNDERSTANDING
4894-7788-0071 HE WAS CONFINED BY A CHAIN WHICH EARLY IMAGINATION AND LONG HABIT MADE HIM THINK MASSY AND STRONG BUT WHICH HAD HE VENTURED TO TRY HE COULD AT ONCE HAVE SNAPT ASUNDER I PROCEEDED
4894-7788-0072 JOHNSON WHY SIR IT IS A VERY HARMLESS DOCTRINE THEY ARE OF OPINION THAT THE GENERALITY OF MANKIND ARE NEITHER SO OBSTINATELY WICKED AS TO DESERVE EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT NOR SO GOOD AS TO MERIT BEING ADMITTED INTO THE SOCIETY OF BLESSED SPIRITS
4894-7788-0073 AND THEREFORE THAT GOD IS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO ALLOW OF A MIDDLE STATE WHERE THEY MAY BE PURIFIED BY CERTAIN DEGREES OF SUFFERING YOU SEE SIR THERE IS NOTHING UNREASONABLE IN THIS BOSWELL BUT THEN SIR THEIR MASSES FOR THE DEAD JOHNSON WHY SIR
4894-7788-0074 IT IS AS PROPER TO PRAY FOR THEM AS FOR OUR BRETHREN OF MANKIND WHO ARE YET IN THIS LIFE BOSWELL THE IDOLATRY OF THE MASS JOHNSON SIR THERE IS NO IDOLATRY IN THE MASS THEY BELIEVE GOD TO BE THERE AND THEY ADORE HIM
4894-7788-0075 I GRANT YOU THAT IN PRACTICE PURGATORY IS MADE A LUCRATIVE IMPOSITION AND THAT THE PEOPLE DO BECOME IDOLATROUS AS THEY RECOMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE TUTELARY PROTECTION OF PARTICULAR SAINTS I THINK THEIR GIVING THE SACRAMENT ONLY IN ONE KIND IS CRIMINAL
4894-7788-0076 BECAUSE IT IS CONTRARY TO THE EXPRESS INSTITUTION OF CHRIST
4894-7788-0077 BOSWELL CONFESSION JOHNSON WHY I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT IS A GOOD THING THE SCRIPTURE SAYS
4894-7788-0078 THEN IT MUST BE CONSIDERED THAT THEIR ABSOLUTION IS ONLY UPON REPENTANCE AND OFTEN UPON PENANCE ALSO YOU THINK YOUR SINS MAY BE FORGIVEN WITHOUT PENANCE UPON REPENTANCE ALONE
4894-7788-0079 I THUS VENTURED TO MENTION ALL THE COMMON OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE ROMAN CATHOLICK CHURCH THAT I MIGHT HEAR SO GREAT A MAN UPON THEM
4894-7788-0080 BUT IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT IF ONE HAD TAKEN THE OTHER SIDE HE MIGHT HAVE REASONED DIFFERENTLY I MUST HOWEVER MENTION THAT HE HAD A RESPECT FOR THE OLD RELIGION
4894-7788-0081 EVEN WHILE HE WAS EXERTING HIMSELF FOR ITS REFORMATION IN SOME PARTICULARS SIR WILLIAM SCOTT INFORMS ME THAT HE HEARD JOHNSON SAY A MAN WHO IS CONVERTED FROM PROTESTANTISM TO POPERY MAY BE SINCERE HE PARTS WITH NOTHING
4894-7788-0082 HE IS ONLY SUPERADDING TO WHAT HE ALREADY HAD BUT A CONVERT FROM POPERY TO PROTESTANTISM GIVES UP SO MUCH OF WHAT HE HAS HELD AS SACRED AS ANY THING THAT HE RETAINS
4894-7788-0083 MAY BE CONFIRMED BY MANY AND EMINENT INSTANCES SOME OF WHICH WILL OCCUR TO MOST OF MY READERS WHEN WE WERE ALONE I INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT OF DEATH AND ENDEAVOURED TO MAINTAIN THAT THE FEAR OF IT MIGHT BE GOT OVER I TOLD HIM THAT DAVID HUME SAID TO ME
4894-7788-0084 THAN THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN BEFORE HE BEGAN TO EXIST JOHNSON SIR IF HE REALLY THINKS SO HIS PERCEPTIONS ARE DISTURBED HE IS MAD IF HE DOES NOT THINK SO HE LIES HE MAY TELL YOU
4894-7788-0085 HE HOLDS HIS FINGER IN THE FLAME OF A CANDLE WITHOUT FEELING PAIN WOULD YOU BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE DIES HE AT LEAST GIVES UP ALL HE HAS BOSWELL FOOTE SIR TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE WAS VERY ILL HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO DIE JOHNSON
4894-7788-0086 AND THREATEN TO KILL THEM AND YOU'LL SEE HOW THEY BEHAVE BOSWELL
4894-7788-0087 HERE I AM SENSIBLE I WAS IN THE WRONG
4894-7788-0088 FOR ALTHOUGH WHEN IN A CELESTIAL FRAME IN HIS VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES HE HAS SUPPOSED DEATH TO BE KIND NATURE'S SIGNAL FOR RETREAT
4894-7788-0089 FULL OF DISMAL APPREHENSIONS HIS MIND RESEMBLED THE VAST AMPHITHEATRE THE COLISAEUM AT ROME IN THE CENTRE STOOD HIS JUDGEMENT WHICH LIKE A MIGHTY GLADIATOR COMBATED THOSE APPREHENSIONS THAT LIKE THE WILD BEASTS OF THE ARENA
4894-7788-0090 WERE ALL AROUND IN CELLS READY TO BE LET OUT UPON HIM AFTER A CONFLICT HE DRIVES THEM BACK INTO THEIR DENS BUT NOT KILLING THEM THEY WERE STILL ASSAILING HIM TO MY QUESTION
4894-7788-0091 HE ANSWERED IN A PASSION NO SIR LET IT ALONE IT MATTERS NOT HOW A MAN DIES BUT HOW HE LIVES
4894-7788-0092 A MAN KNOWS IT MUST BE SO AND SUBMITS IT WILL DO HIM NO GOOD TO WHINE I ATTEMPTED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION HE WAS SO PROVOKED THAT HE SAID GIVE US NO MORE OF THIS AND WAS THROWN INTO SUCH A STATE OF AGITATION
4894-7788-0093 THAT HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT ALARMED AND DISTRESSED ME SHEWED AN IMPATIENCE THAT I SHOULD LEAVE HIM AND WHEN I WAS GOING AWAY CALLED TO ME STERNLY DON'T LET US MEET TO MORROW I WENT HOME EXCEEDINGLY UNEASY
4894-7788-0094 ALL THE HARSH OBSERVATIONS WHICH I HAD EVER HEARD MADE UPON HIS CHARACTER CROWDED INTO MY MIND AND I SEEMED TO MYSELF LIKE THE MAN WHO HAD PUT HIS HEAD INTO THE LION'S MOUTH A GREAT MANY TIMES WITH PERFECT SAFETY BUT AT LAST HAD IT BIT OFF
4894-7788-0095 NEXT MORNING I SENT HIM A NOTE STATING THAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WRONG BUT IT WAS NOT INTENTIONALLY HE WAS THEREFORE I COULD NOT HELP THINKING TOO SEVERE UPON ME THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUR AGREEMENT NOT TO MEET THAT DAY
4894-7788-0096 I WOULD CALL ON HIM IN MY WAY TO THE CITY AND STAY FIVE MINUTES BY MY WATCH YOU ARE SAID I IN MY MIND SINCE LAST NIGHT SURROUNDED WITH CLOUD AND STORM LET ME HAVE A GLIMPSE OF SUNSHINE
4894-7788-0097 UPON ENTERING HIS STUDY I WAS GLAD THAT HE WAS NOT ALONE WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE OUR MEETING MORE AWKWARD
4894-7788-0098 FOR HE RECEIVED ME VERY COMPLACENTLY SO THAT I UNEXPECTEDLY FOUND MYSELF AT EASE AND JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION HE SAID THE CRITICKS HAD DONE TOO MUCH HONOUR
4894-7788-0099 A LINE BY PHILLIPS AND A LINE BY TICKELL
4894-7788-0100 WELL SIR YOU ARE NOW IN GOOD HUMOUR JOHNSON YES SIR I WAS GOING TO LEAVE HIM AND HAD GOT AS FAR AS THE STAIRCASE HE STOPPED ME AND SMILING SAID GET YOU GONE IN
4894-7788-0101 A CURIOUS MODE OF INVITING ME TO STAY WHICH I ACCORDINGLY DID FOR SOME TIME LONGER THIS LITTLE INCIDENTAL QUARREL AND RECONCILIATION WHICH PERHAPS I MAY BE THOUGHT TO HAVE DETAILED TOO MINUTELY
4894-7788-0102 BEGGING THAT HE WOULD MEET ME IN TOWN ON THE NINTH BUT IF THIS SHOULD BE VERY INCONVENIENT TO HIM I WOULD GO THITHER HIS ANSWER WAS AS FOLLOWS
4894-7788-0103 DEAR SIR UPON BALANCING THE INCONVENIENCES OF BOTH PARTIES I FIND IT WILL LESS INCOMMODE YOU TO SPEND YOUR NIGHT HERE THAN ME TO COME TO TOWN I WISH TO SEE YOU AND AM ORDERED BY THE LADY OF THIS HOUSE TO INVITE YOU HITHER WHETHER YOU CAN COME OR NOT
4894-7788-0104 AND THEREFORE TELL YOU NOW THAT WITH GREAT SINCERITY I WISH YOU HAPPINESS I AM DEAR SIR YOUR MOST AFFECTIONATE HUMBLE SERVANT SAM JOHNSON NOVEMBER NINE SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE I WAS DETAINED IN TOWN TILL IT WAS TOO LATE ON THE NINTH
4894-7788-0105 NOW SAID HE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO MARRY DO NOT EXPECT MORE FROM LIFE THAN LIFE WILL AFFORD YOU MAY OFTEN FIND YOURSELF OUT OF HUMOUR AND YOU MAY OFTEN THINK YOUR WIFE NOT STUDIOUS ENOUGH TO PLEASE YOU
4894-7788-0106 AND YET YOU MAY HAVE REASON TO CONSIDER YOURSELF AS UPON THE WHOLE VERY HAPPILY MARRIED TALKING OF MARRIAGE IN GENERAL HE OBSERVED OUR MARRIAGE SERVICE IS TOO REFINED IT IS CALCULATED ONLY FOR THE BEST KIND OF MARRIAGES
4894-7788-0107 WHEREAS WE SHOULD HAVE A FORM FOR MATCHES OF CONVENIENCE OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY HE AGREED WITH ME THAT THERE WAS NO ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR HAVING THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY PERFORMED BY A REGULAR CLERGYMAN FOR THIS WAS NOT COMMANDED IN SCRIPTURE
4894-7788-0108 I WAS VOLATILE ENOUGH TO REPEAT TO HIM A LITTLE EPIGRAMMATICK SONG OF MINE ON MATRIMONY
4894-7788-0109 A MATRIMONIAL THOUGHT IN THE BLITHE DAYS OF HONEY MOON WITH KATE'S ALLUREMENTS SMITTEN I LOV'D HER LATE I LOV'D HER SOON AND CALL'D HER DEAREST KITTEN BUT NOW MY KITTEN'S GROWN A CAT AND CROSS LIKE OTHER WIVES
4894-7788-0110 O BY MY SOUL MY HONEST MAT I FEAR SHE HAS NINE LIVES MY ILLUSTRIOUS FRIEND SAID IT IS VERY WELL SIR BUT YOU SHOULD NOT SWEAR UPON WHICH I ALTERED O BY MY SOUL TO ALAS ALAS
4894-7788-0111 HE WAS SO GOOD AS TO ACCOMPANY ME TO LONDON AND SEE ME INTO THE POST CHAISE WHICH WAS TO CARRY ME ON MY ROAD TO SCOTLAND
