5401-39515-0000 WITH THE CLOSE OF THE PERMIAN THE WORLD OF ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE HAD SO CHANGED THAT THE LINE IS DRAWN HERE WHICH MARKS THE END OF THE OLD ORDER AND THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AND SEPARATES THE PALEOZOIC FROM THE SUCCEEDING ERA THE MESOZOIC THE MIDDLE AGE OF GEOLOGICAL HISTORY
5401-39515-0001 ALTHOUGH THE MESOZOIC ERA IS SHORTER THAN THE PALEOZOIC AS MEASURED BY THE THICKNESS OF THEIR STRATA YET ITS DURATION MUST BE RECKONED IN MILLIONS OF YEARS
5401-39515-0002 THE MESOZOIC COMPRISES THREE SYSTEMS THE TRIASSIC NAMED FROM ITS THREEFOLD DIVISION IN GERMANY THE JURASSIC WHICH IS WELL DISPLAYED IN THE JURA MOUNTAINS AND THE CRETACEOUS WHICH CONTAINS THE EXTENSIVE CHALK LATIN CRETA DEPOSITS OF EUROPE IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA
5401-39515-0003 THE MESOZOIC ROCKS ARE MUCH LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE PALEOZOIC FOR MUCH OF THIS PORTION OF THE CONTINENT WAS LAND DURING THE MESOZOIC ERA AND THE AREA OF THE MESOZOIC ROCKS IS SMALL IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA ON THE OTHER HAND THE STRATA OF THE MESOZOIC
5401-39515-0004 THE PALEOZOIC ROCKS ARE BURIED QUITE GENERALLY FROM VIEW
5401-39515-0005 THE TRIASSIC AND JURASSIC EASTERN NORTH AMERICA THE SEDIMENTARY RECORD INTERRUPTED BY THE APPALACHIAN DEFORMATION WAS NOT RENEWED IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA UNTIL LATE IN THE TRIASSIC
5401-39515-0006 HENCE DURING THIS LONG INTERVAL THE LAND STOOD HIGH THE COAST WAS FARTHER OUT THAN NOW
5401-39515-0007 EVIDENTLY SUBSIDENCE WAS IN PROGRESS WHERE THESE ROCKS WERE DEPOSITED THE EASTERN BORDER OF APPALACHIA WAS NOW DEPRESSED THE OLDLAND WAS WARPING AND LONG BELTS OF COUNTRY LYING PARALLEL TO THE SHORE SUBSIDED FORMING TROUGHS IN WHICH THOUSANDS OF FEET OF SEDIMENT NOW GATHERED
5401-39515-0008 THESE TRIASSIC ROCKS WHICH ARE CHIEFLY SANDSTONES HOLD NO MARINE FOSSILS AND HENCE WERE NOT LAID IN OPEN ARMS OF THE SEA BUT THEIR LAYERS ARE OFTEN RIPPLE MARKED AND CONTAIN MANY TRACKS OF REPTILES IMPRINTS OF RAINDROPS AND SOME FOSSIL WOOD
5401-39515-0009 WHILE AN OCCASIONAL BED OF SHALE IS FILLED WITH THE REMAINS OF FISHES WE MAY CONCEIVE THEN OF THE CONNECTICUT VALLEY
5401-39515-0010 PERHAPS NOW AND THEN THE BASINS BECAME LONG BRACKISH ESTUARIES WHOSE LOW SHORES WERE SWEPT BY THE INCOMING TIDE AND WERE IN TURN LEFT BARE AT ITS RETREAT TO RECEIVE THE RAIN PRINTS OF PASSING SHOWERS AND THE TRACKS OF THE TROOPS OF REPTILES WHICH INHABITED THESE VALLEYS
5401-39515-0011 THE TRIASSIC ROCKS ARE MAINLY RED SANDSTONES OFTEN FELDSPATHIC OR ARKOSE WITH SOME CONGLOMERATES AND SHALES CONSIDERING THE LARGE AMOUNT OF FELDSPATHIC MATERIAL IN THESE ROCKS DO YOU INFER THAT THEY WERE DERIVED FROM THE ADJACENT CRYSTALLINE AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS OF THE OLDLAND OF APPALACHIA
5401-39515-0012 OR FROM THE SEDIMENTARY PALEOZOIC ROCKS WHICH HAD BEEN FOLDED INTO MOUNTAINS DURING THE APPALACHIAN DEFORMATION IF FROM THE FORMER WAS THE DRAINAGE OF THE NORTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAIN REGION THEN AS NOW EASTWARD AND SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARD THE ATLANTIC
5401-39515-0013 THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES ARE VOLUMINOUS MEASURING AT LEAST A MILE IN THICKNESS AND ARE LARGELY OF COARSE WASTE
5401-39515-0014 IN THE SOUTHERN BASINS AS ABOUT RICHMOND VIRGINIA ARE VALUABLE BEDS OF COAL WHAT WAS THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THESE AREAS WHEN THE COAL WAS BEING FORMED INTERBEDDED WITH THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES ARE CONTEMPORANEOUS LAVA BEDS WHICH WERE FED FROM DIKES
5401-39515-0015 VOLCANIC ACTION WHICH HAD BEEN REMARKABLY ABSENT IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA DURING PALEOZOIC TIMES WAS WELL MARKED IN CONNECTION WITH THE WARPING NOW IN PROGRESS THICK INTRUSIVE SHEETS HAVE ALSO BEEN DRIVEN IN AMONG THE STRATA AS FOR EXAMPLE
5401-39515-0016 THE SHEET OF THE PALISADES OF THE HUDSON
5401-39515-0017 WHAT EFFECT HAVE THESE SHEETS ON THE PRESENT TOPOGRAPHY AND WHY ASSUMING THAT THE TRIASSIC DEFORMATION WENT ON MORE RAPIDLY THAN DENUDATION WHAT WAS ITS EFFECT ON THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE TIME ARE THERE ANY OF ITS RESULTS REMAINING IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF TO DAY
5401-39515-0018 DO THE TRIASSIC AREAS NOW STAND HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AND WHY HOW DO THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES AND SHALES COMPARE IN HARDNESS WITH THE IGNEOUS AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS ABOUT THEM
5401-39515-0019 PENNSYLVANIA AND FARTHER SOUTHWEST THE LOWEST STRATA OF THE NEXT PERIOD THE CRETACEOUS
5401-39515-0020 THE SURFACE ON WHICH THEY LIE IS WORN SO EVEN THAT WE MUST BELIEVE THAT AT THE OPENING OF THE CRETACEOUS THE OLDLAND OF APPALACHIA INCLUDING THE TRIASSIC AREAS HAD BEEN BASELEVELED AT LEAST NEAR THE COAST
5401-39515-0021 WHEN THEREFORE DID THE DEFORMATION OF THE TRIASSIC ROCKS OCCUR WESTERN NORTH AMERICA TRIASSIC STRATA INFOLDED IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS CARRY MARINE FOSSILS AND REACH A THICKNESS OF NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND FEET
5401-39515-0022 CALIFORNIA WAS THEN UNDER WATER AND THE SITE OF THE SIERRA WAS A SUBSIDING TROUGH SLOWLY FILLING WITH WASTE FROM THE GREAT BASIN LAND TO THE EAST OVER A LONG BELT WHICH REACHES FROM WYOMING ACROSS COLORADO INTO NEW MEXICO
5401-39515-0023 NO TRIASSIC SEDIMENTS ARE FOUND NOR IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE EVER PRESENT HENCE THIS AREA WAS HIGH LAND SUFFERING EROSION DURING THE TRIASSIC ON EACH SIDE OF IT
5401-39515-0024 WITH SOME ROCK SALT AND GYPSUM FOSSILS ARE VERY RARE AND NONE OF THEM MARINE HERE THEN LAY BROAD SHALLOW LAKES OFTEN SALT AND WARPED BASINS IN WHICH THE WASTE OF THE ADJACENT UPLANDS GATHERED
5401-39515-0025 FROM THE LAND LYING TO THE EAST CONTEMPORANEOUS LAVA FLOWS INTERBEDDED WITH THE STRATA SHOW THAT VOLCANIC ACTION ACCOMPANIED THE DOWNWARP AND THAT MOLTEN ROCK WAS DRIVEN UPWARD THROUGH FISSURES IN THE CRUST AND OUTSPREAD OVER THE SEA FLOOR IN SHEETS OF LAVA
5401-39515-0026 THE SIERRA DEFORMATION EVER SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE SILURIAN THE SIERRA TROUGH HAD BEEN SINKING THOUGH NO DOUBT WITH HALTS AND INTERRUPTIONS UNTIL IT CONTAINED NEARLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FEET OF SEDIMENT
5401-39515-0027 AT THE CLOSE OF THE JURASSIC IT YIELDED TO LATERAL PRESSURE AND THE VAST PILE OF STRATA WAS CRUMPLED AND UPHEAVED INTO TOWERING MOUNTAINS THE MESOZOIC MUDS WERE HARDENED AND SQUEEZED INTO SLATES THE ROCKS WERE WRENCHED AND BROKEN
5401-39515-0028 THE BRITISH ISLES THE TRIASSIC STRATA OF THE BRITISH ISLES ARE CONTINENTAL AND INCLUDE BRECCIA BEDS OF CEMENTED TALUS DEPOSITS OF SALT AND GYPSUM AND SANDSTONES WHOSE ROUNDED AND POLISHED GRAINS ARE THOSE OF THE WIND BLOWN SANDS OF DESERTS
5401-39515-0029 IN TRIASSIC TIMES THE BRITISH ISLES WERE PART OF A DESERT EXTENDING OVER MUCH OF NORTHWESTERN EUROPE THE CRETACEOUS THE THIRD GREAT SYSTEM OF THE MESOZOIC INCLUDES MANY FORMATIONS MARINE AND CONTINENTAL
5401-39515-0030 WHICH RECORD A LONG AND COMPLICATED HISTORY MARKED BY GREAT OSCILLATIONS OF THE CRUST AND WIDE CHANGES IN THE OUTLINES OF SEA AND LAND EARLY CRETACEOUS
5401-39515-0031 IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA THE LOWEST CRETACEOUS SERIES COMPRISES FRESH WATER FORMATIONS WHICH ARE TRACED FROM NANTUCKET ACROSS MARTHA'S VINEYARD AND LONG ISLAND AND THROUGH NEW JERSEY SOUTHWARD INTO GEORGIA THEY REST UNCONFORMABLY ON THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES AND THE OLDER ROCKS OF THE REGION
5401-39515-0032 REACHING FROM GEORGIA NORTHWESTWARD INTO TENNESSEE AND THENCE ACROSS INTO ARKANSAS AND SOUTHWARD INTO TEXAS IN THE SOUTHWEST THE SUBSIDENCE CONTINUED UNTIL THE TRANSGRESSING SEA COVERED MOST OF MEXICO AND TEXAS AND EXTENDED A GULF NORTHWARD INTO KANSAS
5401-39515-0033 IN ITS WARM AND QUIET WATERS LIMESTONES ACCUMULATED TO A DEPTH OF FROM ONE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND FEET IN TEXAS AND OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND FEET IN MEXICO MEANWHILE THE LOWLANDS WHERE THE GREAT PLAINS ARE NOW RECEIVED CONTINENTAL DEPOSITS
5401-39515-0034 COAL SWAMPS STRETCHED FROM WESTERN MONTANA INTO BRITISH COLUMBIA THE MIDDLE CRETACEOUS THIS WAS A LAND EPOCH THE EARLY CRETACEOUS SEA RETIRED FROM TEXAS AND MEXICO
5401-39515-0035 FOR ITS SEDIMENTS ARE OVERLAIN UNCONFORMABLY BY FORMATIONS OF THE UPPER CRETACEOUS SO LONG WAS THE TIME GAP BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES THAT NO SPECIES FOUND IN THE ONE OCCURS IN THE OTHER THE UPPER CRETACEOUS
5401-39515-0036 THERE NOW BEGAN ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE EVENTS IN ALL GEOLOGICAL HISTORY THE GREAT CRETACEOUS SUBSIDENCE ITS EARLIER WARPINGS WERE RECORDED IN CONTINENTAL DEPOSITS WIDE SHEETS OF SANDSTONE SHALE AND SOME COAL WHICH WERE SPREAD FROM TEXAS TO BRITISH COLUMBIA
5401-39515-0037 WE MAY INFER THAT AS THE DEPRESSION OF THE CONTINENT CONTINUED THE SEA CAME IN FAR AND WIDE OVER THE COAST LANDS AND THE PLAINS WORN LOW DURING THE PREVIOUS EPOCHS UPPER CRETACEOUS FORMATIONS SHOW THAT SOUTH OF NEW ENGLAND
5401-39515-0038 THE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC SOMEWHAT OVERLAPPED THE CRYSTALLINE ROCKS OF THE PIEDMONT BELT AND SPREAD THEIR WASTE OVER THE SUBMERGED COASTAL PLAIN THE GULF OF MEXICO AGAIN COVERED THE MISSISSIPPI EMBAYMENT
5401-39515-0039 REACHING AS FAR NORTH AS SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND EXTENDED OVER TEXAS A MEDITERRANEAN SEA NOW STRETCHED FROM THE GULF TO THE ARCTIC REGIONS AND FROM CENTRAL IOWA TO THE EASTERN SHORE OF THE GREAT BASIN LAND AT ABOUT THE LONGITUDE OF SALT LAKE CITY THE COLORADO MOUNTAINS RISING FROM IT IN A CHAIN OF ISLANDS
5401-39515-0040 THE LONG BELT LYING WEST OF THE ANCIENT AXES OF THE COLORADO ISLANDS AND EAST OF THE GREAT BASIN LAND HAD BEEN AN AREA OF DEPOSITION FOR MANY AGES AND IN ITS SUBSIDING TROUGHS PALEOZOIC AND MESOZOIC SEDIMENTS HAD GATHERED TO THE DEPTH OF MANY THOUSAND FEET
5401-39515-0041 AND NOW FROM MEXICO WELL NIGH TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN THIS BELT YIELDED TO LATERAL PRESSURE THE CRETACEOUS LIMESTONES OF MEXICO WERE FOLDED INTO LOFTY MOUNTAINS A MASSIVE RANGE WAS UPFOLDED WHERE THE WASATCH MOUNTAINS NOW ARE
5401-39515-0042 AND VARIOUS RANGES OF THE ROCKIES IN COLORADO AND OTHER STATES WERE UPRIDGED HOWEVER SLOWLY THESE DEFORMATIONS WERE EFFECTED THEY WERE NO DOUBT ACCOMPANIED BY WORLD SHAKING EARTHQUAKES AND IT IS KNOWN THAT VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS TOOK PLACE ON A MAGNIFICENT SCALE
5401-39515-0043 OUTFLOWS OF LAVA OCCURRED ALONG THE WASATCH THE LACCOLITHS OF THE HENRY MOUNTAINS WERE FORMED WHILE THE GREAT MASSES OF IGNEOUS ROCK WHICH CONSTITUTE THE CORES OF THE SPANISH PEAKS AND OTHER WESTERN MOUNTAINS WERE THRUST UP AMID THE STRATA
5401-39515-0044 THE MESOZOIC ERA WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS
5401-39515-0045 THE SAME PLAIN EXTENDED OVER SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND
