7730-304541-0000 THIS CHAPTER IS WRITTEN MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS LATER THAN THE FOREGOING IN FURTHER TESTIMONY AND PRAISE RETURNING TO CANADA AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT WAR WE CAME FACE TO FACE WITH A SERIOUS FINANCIAL CRISIS
7730-304541-0001 ONLY TWO WAYS SEEMED OPEN TO US ONE WAS TO LAY OUR AFFAIRS FRANKLY BEFORE THE BOARD SHOWING THAT OUR SALARY WAS QUITE INSUFFICIENT WITH WAR CONDITIONS AND PRICES TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS
7730-304541-0002 AS WE ENTERED THE DINING ROOM WE FOUND A LARGE MAIL FROM CHINA ON THE TABLE ONE LETTER WAS FORWARDED FROM THE LADY IN AUSTRALIA WHOSE GIFTS IN THE PAST SEEMED ALWAYS TO HAVE MET SOME FELT NEED
7730-304541-0003 HER LETTER ENCLOSED FIFTY POUNDS WITH THE EXPRESSED WISH THAT THIRTY POUNDS SHOULD BE USED FOR WORK IN CHINA BUT TWENTY POUNDS WAS TO BE USED TO MEET SOME PERSONAL NEED I HANDED THE LETTER TO MY DAUGHTER SAYING SHALL WE NOT BELIEVE THAT GOD WILL UNDERTAKE FOR US
7730-304541-0004 IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF OUR FATHER WERE BESIDE US SAYING MY CHILD TAKE THIS HUNDRED DOLLARS AS AN EARNEST OF WHAT I AM GOING TO DO FOR YOU TEARS STOOD IN HER EYES AS MY DAUGHTER GAVE THE LETTER BACK SAYING MOTHER WE DON'T TRUST GOD HALF ENOUGH
7730-304541-0005 WERE I TO ATTEMPT TO WRITE THE HISTORY OF THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED A LONG CHAPTER WOULD BE REQUIRED BUT MY TESTIMONY ALONG THIS LINE IS SURELY SUFFICIENT IT WAS ON THIS SAME FURLOUGH THAT I CAME TO HAVE AN ENLARGED VISION OF MY HEAVENLY FATHER'S WILLINGNESS
7730-304541-0006 AND I REJOICE TO TESTIFY THAT THE RESULT OF THIS DECISION BECAME A CONSTANT SOURCE OF WONDER AND PRAISE YES I FOUND THE LORD COULD GUIDE ME EVEN IN TRIMMING MY HAT TO HIS GLORY
7730-304541-0007 THAT IS SO THAT I COULD STAND UP BEFORE AN AUDIENCE AND NOT BRING DISCREDIT TO MY MASTER PRAISE HIS NAME THERE IS NOTHING TOO GREAT FOR HIS POWER AND NOTHING TOO SMALL FOR HIS LOVE
7730-304541-0008 AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT WAR A SON HAD GONE TO ENGLAND WITH THE FIRST CANADIAN CONTINGENT WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED US IN CHINA I BEGAN TO PRAY DEFINITELY THAT THE LORD WOULD USE MY SON'S GIFTS IN THE BEST WAY FOR HIS COUNTRY'S GOOD
7730-304541-0009 BUT WOULD KEEP HIM BACK FROM THE TRENCHES AND FROM ACTUAL WARFARE MY BOY DID NOT KNOW OF THIS PRAYER SOME WEEKS AFTER REACHING ENGLAND HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO LEAVING FOR THE TRENCHES IN FRANCE
7730-304541-0010 WHEN ORDERS CAME THAT HE WAS NEEDED IN THE ORDERLY ROOM AND HIS UNIT LEFT WITHOUT HIM MONTHS LATER A CALL CAME FOR VOLUNTEERS TO FILL THE GREAT GAPS MADE AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST USE OF GAS
7730-304541-0011 MY BOY RESIGNED HIS POSITION AND JOINED THE COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS TO BE SENT TO FRANCE JUST BEFORE THEY WERE TO LEAVE HE WAS AGAIN SENT FOR FROM HEADQUARTERS AND TOLD HE WAS TO GO TO THE CANADIAN BASE IN FRANCE AS ADJUTANT
7730-304541-0012 HIS DUTIES IN THIS CAPACITY KEPT HIM AT THE FORWARDING BASE A YEAR LATER HE AGAIN PLANNED TO RESIGN IN ORDER TO GET TO THE TRENCHES HE HAD BEGUN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THIS STEP WHEN HE HAD A FALL FROM HIS HORSE
7730-304541-0013 WHICH CAUSED HIM TO BE INVALIDED HOME TO CANADA WHERE HE WAS KEPT TILL THE CLOSE OF THE WAR IT WOULD INDEED BE DIFFICULT TO PERSUADE HIS MOTHER THAT ALL THIS HAPPENED BY CHANCE
7730-304541-0014 FOR ONE DAY WHEN IN GREAT DISTRESS EXPECTING ANY DAY A CABLE TO SAY HE HAD LEFT FOR THE TRENCHES I RECEIVED A MOST CLEAR ASSURANCE FROM THE LORD THAT HE HAD THE BOY IN HIS KEEPING
7730-304541-0015 AFTER OUR RETURN TO CHINA WHEN IN GREAT TROUBLE I PRAYED THE LORD TO GRANT ME A CLEAR SIGN OF HIS FAVOR BY GIVING ME A CERTAIN PETITION WHICH AFFECTED A CHILD IN THE HOMELAND THE REQUEST WAS A COMPLICATED ONE INCLUDING SEVERAL DEFINITE DETAILS
7730-304541-0016 A LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH LATER A LETTER REACHED ME FROM THE ONE FOR WHOM I HAD ASKED THE LORD'S FAVOR SHE WROTE JOYOUSLY TELLING THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED JUST WHAT I HAD ASKED FOR AND IN EVERY DETAIL AS I HAD PRAYED
7730-304541-0017 IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR US TO FIND A HOME ELSEWHERE
7730-304541-0018 ON GOING THERE TO GET A SITE FOR OUR HOME THOUGH WE LOOKED FOR MORE THAN A WEEK WE COULD FIND NO PLACE AS WE STARTED DOWN THE HILL ONE MORNING SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT
7730-304541-0019 A FRIEND ON THE TRAIN TRAVELING THIRD CLASS SAW US GETTING ON THE SECOND CLASS AND CAME IN FOR A FEW WORDS BEFORE GETTING OFF THE TRAIN WHEN HE HEARD WE HAD FAILED TO GET A SITE HE SAID
7730-304541-0020 I KNOW OF A BEAUTIFUL SITE WHICH OUR MISSION IS RESERVING FOR A FUTURE MISSIONARY I'LL ASK THEM TO GIVE IT TO YOU
7730-304541-0021 I AM NOW WRITING THESE CLOSING WORDS IN OUR GOD GIVEN HOME BUILT ON THIS BEAUTIFUL SITE ONE OF THE MOST LOVELY SPOTS TO BE FOUND IN CHINA SO FROM THIS QUIET MOUNTAIN RETREAT A MONUMENT OF WHAT GOD CAN GIVE IN ANSWER TO PRAYER
7730-304541-0022 THIS LITTLE BOOK OF PRAYER TESTIMONIES IS SENT FORTH AS THE PAST HAS BEEN REVIEWED AND GOD'S WONDERFUL FAITHFULNESS RECALLED THERE HAS COME A GREAT SENSE OF REGRET THAT I HAVE NOT TRUSTED GOD MORE AND ASKED MORE OF HIM BOTH FOR MY FAMILY AND THE CHINESE
7730-304541-0023 YES IT IS TRULY WONDERFUL BUT THE WONDER IS NOT THAT GOD CAN ANSWER PRAYER BUT THAT HE DOES WHEN WE SO IMPERFECTLY MEET THE CONDITIONS CLEARLY LAID DOWN IN HIS WORD IN RECENT YEARS I HAVE OFTEN TESTED MYSELF BY THESE CONDITIONS
7730-304541-0024 AND THERE HAS COME A CONSCIOUS SPIRITUAL SAGGING AS THE DISCERNING SOUL CAN PLAINLY SEE ALL THE CONDITIONS MENTIONED IN THE LIST BELOW MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE ONE WORD ABIDE CONDITIONS OF PREVAILING PRAYER
7730-304541-0025 ONE CONTRITE HUMILITY BEFORE GOD AND FORSAKING OF SIN
7730-304541-0026 MUST BE WILLING TO MAKE AMENDS FOR WRONGS TO OTHERS
7730-304541-0027 FIVE WRONG MOTIVES JAMES FOUR TWO THREE SIX DESPISING GOD'S LAW AMOS TWO FOUR
