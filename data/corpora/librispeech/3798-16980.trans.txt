3798-16980-0001 AND STEPPED OUT SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE ROAD WHICH RAN BY THE HOUSE ACROSS THE CANAL ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE LEVEL GREEN FIELDS THAT LAY BEYOND CLEAR TO THE BLUE RIM OF THE WORLD WHERE THE SKY TOUCHES THE EARTH
3798-16980-0002 THE SKY WAS VERY BLUE
3798-16980-0003 AS SHE WENT BACK INTO HER KITCHEN KIT AND KAT WERE STILL ASLEEP
3798-16980-0004 SHE GAVE THEM EACH A KISS THE TWINS OPENED THEIR EYES AND SAT UP
