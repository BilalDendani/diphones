114-129317-0000 CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER IT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH HAPPINESS TO BEAR
114-129317-0001 OLIVER FELT STUNNED AND STUPEFIED BY THE UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE HE COULD NOT WEEP OR SPEAK OR REST HE HAD SCARCELY THE POWER OF UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING THAT HAD PASSED UNTIL AFTER A LONG RAMBLE IN THE QUIET EVENING AIR
114-129317-0002 A BURST OF TEARS CAME TO HIS RELIEF AND HE SEEMED TO AWAKEN ALL AT ONCE TO A FULL SENSE OF THE JOYFUL CHANGE THAT HAD OCCURRED AND THE ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE LOAD OF ANGUISH WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIS BREAST THE NIGHT WAS FAST CLOSING IN WHEN HE RETURNED HOMEWARD
114-129317-0003 LADEN WITH FLOWERS WHICH HE HAD CULLED WITH PECULIAR CARE FOR THE ADORNMENT OF THE SICK CHAMBER AS HE WALKED BRISKLY ALONG THE ROAD HE HEARD BEHIND HIM THE NOISE OF SOME VEHICLE APPROACHING AT A FURIOUS PACE
114-129317-0004 RUNNING UP TO THE CHAISE DOOR GILES POPPED OUT HIS NIGHTCAP AGAIN PREPARATORY TO MAKING SOME REPLY WHEN HE WAS SUDDENLY PULLED BACK BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO OCCUPIED THE OTHER CORNER OF THE CHAISE AND WHO EAGERLY DEMANDED WHAT WAS THE NEWS
114-129317-0005 IN A WORD CRIED THE GENTLEMAN BETTER OR WORSE BETTER MUCH BETTER REPLIED OLIVER HASTILY THANK HEAVEN EXCLAIMED THE GENTLEMAN YOU ARE SURE QUITE SIR REPLIED OLIVER THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE ONLY A FEW HOURS AGO
114-129317-0006 AND MISTER LOSBERNE SAYS THAT ALL DANGER IS AT AN END THE GENTLEMAN SAID NOT ANOTHER WORD BUT OPENING THE CHAISE DOOR LEAPED OUT AND TAKING OLIVER HURRIEDLY BY THE ARM LED HIM ASIDE YOU ARE QUITE CERTAIN
114-129317-0007 THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ANY MISTAKE ON YOUR PART MY BOY IS THERE DEMANDED THE GENTLEMAN IN A TREMULOUS VOICE DO NOT DECEIVE ME BY AWAKENING HOPES THAT ARE NOT TO BE FULFILLED I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD SIR REPLIED OLIVER INDEED YOU MAY BELIEVE ME
114-129317-0008 HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE STEPS OF THE CHAISE SUPPORTING AN ELBOW ON EACH KNEE AND WIPING HIS EYES WITH A BLUE COTTON POCKET HANDKERCHIEF DOTTED WITH WHITE SPOTS THAT THE HONEST FELLOW HAD NOT BEEN FEIGNING EMOTION
114-129317-0009 I WOULD RATHER WALK SLOWLY ON SO AS TO GAIN A LITTLE TIME BEFORE I SEE HER YOU CAN SAY I AM COMING I BEG YOUR PARDON MISTER HARRY SAID GILES GIVING A FINAL POLISH TO HIS RUFFLED COUNTENANCE WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF BUT IF YOU WOULD LEAVE THE POSTBOY TO SAY THAT
114-129317-0010 THIS DONE THE POSTBOY DROVE OFF GILES MISTER MAYLIE AND OLIVER FOLLOWED AT THEIR LEISURE AS THEY WALKED ALONG OLIVER GLANCED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH MUCH INTEREST AND CURIOSITY AT THE NEW COMER
114-129317-0011 HE SEEMED ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND WAS OF THE MIDDLE HEIGHT HIS COUNTENANCE WAS FRANK AND HANDSOME AND HIS DEMEANOR EASY AND PREPOSSESSING NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUTH AND AGE
114-129317-0012 HE BORE SO STRONG A LIKENESS TO THE OLD LADY THAT OLIVER WOULD HAVE HAD NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN IMAGINING THEIR RELATIONSHIP IF HE HAD NOT ALREADY SPOKEN OF HER AS HIS MOTHER MISSUS MAYLIE WAS ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO RECEIVE HER SON WHEN HE REACHED THE COTTAGE
114-129317-0013 IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE HARRY SAID MISSUS MAYLIE
114-129317-0014 AND THAT YOUR ARRIVAL HERE A DAY SOONER OR A DAY LATER

114-129317-0016 I KNOW THAT SHE DESERVES THE BEST AND PUREST LOVE THE HEART OF MAN CAN OFFER SAID MISSUS MAYLIE I KNOW THAT THE DEVOTION AND AFFECTION OF HER NATURE REQUIRE NO ORDINARY RETURN BUT ONE THAT SHALL BE DEEP AND LASTING IF I DID NOT FEEL THIS
114-129317-0017 DO YOU STILL SUPPOSE THAT I AM A BOY IGNORANT OF MY OWN MIND AND MISTAKING THE IMPULSES OF MY OWN SOUL I THINK MY DEAR SON RETURNED MISSUS MAYLIE LAYING HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
114-129317-0018 THAT YOUTH HAS MANY GENEROUS IMPULSES WHICH DO NOT LAST AND THAT AMONG THEM ARE SOME WHICH BEING GRATIFIED BECOME ONLY THE MORE FLEETING ABOVE ALL I THINK SAID THE LADY FIXING HER EYES ON HER SON'S FACE THAT IF AN ENTHUSIASTIC
114-129317-0019 AND IN EXACT PROPORTION TO HIS SUCCESS IN THE WORLD BE CAST IN HIS TEETH AND MADE THE SUBJECT OF SNEERS AGAINST HIM HE MAY NO MATTER HOW GENEROUS AND GOOD HIS NATURE
114-129317-0020 MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN IMPATIENTLY HE WOULD BE A SELFISH BRUTE UNWORTHY ALIKE OF THE NAME OF MAN AND OF THE WOMAN YOU DESCRIBE WHO ACTED THUS YOU THINK SO NOW HARRY REPLIED HIS MOTHER AND EVER WILL SAID THE YOUNG MAN

114-129317-0022 AND WHY SHOULD I SUFFER THE PAIN OF A DELAY IN GIVING THEM VENT WHICH CAN BE PRODUCTIVE OF NO EARTHLY GOOD NO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE ROSE SHALL HEAR ME SHE SHALL SAID MISSUS MAYLIE
114-129317-0023 THERE IS SOMETHING IN YOUR MANNER WHICH WOULD ALMOST IMPLY THAT SHE WILL HEAR ME COLDLY MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN NOT COLDLY REJOINED THE OLD LADY FAR FROM IT HOW THEN
114-129317-0024 URGED THE YOUNG MAN SHE HAS FORMED NO OTHER ATTACHMENT NO INDEED REPLIED HIS MOTHER YOU HAVE OR I MISTAKE TOO STRONG A HOLD ON HER AFFECTIONS ALREADY WHAT I WOULD SAY RESUMED THE OLD LADY STOPPING HER SON AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK
114-129317-0025 HAS ALWAYS BEEN HER CHARACTERISTIC WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT I LEAVE YOU TO DISCOVER REPLIED MISSUS MAYLIE I MUST GO BACK TO HER GOD BLESS YOU I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT SAID THE YOUNG MAN EAGERLY
114-129317-0026 THE FORMER NOW HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HARRY MAYLIE AND HEARTY SALUTATIONS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM THE DOCTOR THEN COMMUNICATED IN REPLY TO MULTIFARIOUS QUESTIONS FROM HIS YOUNG FRIEND A PRECISE ACCOUNT OF HIS PATIENT'S SITUATION
114-129317-0027 WHICH WAS QUITE AS CONSOLATORY AND FULL OF PROMISE AS OLIVER'S STATEMENT HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE AND TO THE WHOLE OF WHICH MISTER GILES WHO AFFECTED TO BE BUSY ABOUT THE LUGGAGE LISTENED WITH GREEDY EARS
114-129317-0028 HAVE YOU SHOT ANYTHING PARTICULAR LATELY GILES INQUIRED THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED NOTHING PARTICULAR SIR REPLIED MISTER GILES COLOURING UP TO THE EYES NOR CATCHING ANY THIEVES NOR IDENTIFYING ANY HOUSE BREAKERS
114-129317-0029 SAID THE DOCTOR NONE AT ALL SIR REPLIED MISTER GILES WITH MUCH GRAVITY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR I AM SORRY TO HEAR IT BECAUSE YOU DO THAT SORT OF THING ADMIRABLY PRAY HOW IS BRITTLES
114-129317-0030 TO DEPOSIT IN THE LOCAL SAVINGS BANK THE SUM OF FIVE AND TWENTY POUNDS FOR HIS SOLE USE AND BENEFIT AT THIS THE TWO WOMEN SERVANTS LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS AND EYES AND SUPPOSED THAT MISTER GILES PULLING OUT HIS SHIRT FRILL REPLIED NO NO
114-129317-0031 AND WERE WITHAL AS ORIGINAL AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS THE REMARKS OF GREAT MEN COMMONLY ARE ABOVE STAIRS THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY FOR THE DOCTOR WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND HOWEVER FATIGUED OR THOUGHTFUL HARRY MAYLIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST
114-129317-0032 AND IT WAS LATE BEFORE THEY RETIRED WITH LIGHT AND THANKFUL HEARTS TO TAKE THAT REST OF WHICH AFTER THE DOUBT AND SUSPENSE THEY HAD RECENTLY UNDERGONE THEY STOOD MUCH IN NEED OLIVER ROSE NEXT MORNING IN BETTER HEART
114-129317-0033 AND WENT ABOUT HIS USUAL OCCUPATIONS WITH MORE HOPE AND PLEASURE THAN HE HAD KNOWN FOR MANY DAYS THE BIRDS WERE ONCE MORE HUNG OUT TO SING IN THEIR OLD PLACES AND THE SWEETEST WILD FLOWERS THAT COULD BE FOUND WERE ONCE MORE GATHERED TO GLADDEN ROSE WITH THEIR BEAUTY
114-129317-0034 THE MELANCHOLY WHICH HAD SEEMED TO THE SAD EYES OF THE ANXIOUS BOY TO HANG FOR DAYS PAST OVER EVERY OBJECT BEAUTIFUL AS ALL WERE WAS DISPELLED BY MAGIC THE DEW SEEMED TO SPARKLE MORE BRIGHTLY ON THE GREEN LEAVES THE AIR TO RUSTLE AMONG THEM WITH A SWEETER MUSIC
114-129317-0035 ARE IN THE RIGHT BUT THE SOMBRE COLOURS ARE REFLECTIONS FROM THEIR OWN JAUNDICED EYES AND HEARTS THE REAL HUES ARE DELICATE AND NEED A CLEARER VISION IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK AND OLIVER DID NOT FAIL TO NOTE IT AT THE TIME THAT HIS MORNING EXPEDITIONS WERE NO LONGER MADE ALONE
114-129317-0036 OLIVER COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT THE WITHERED FLOWERS WERE NEVER THROWN AWAY ALTHOUGH THE LITTLE VASE WAS REGULARLY REPLENISHED NOR COULD HE HELP OBSERVING THAT WHENEVER THE DOCTOR CAME INTO THE GARDEN HE INVARIABLY CAST HIS EYES UP TO THAT PARTICULAR CORNER
114-129317-0037 YET LEFT HER CHAMBER AND THERE WERE NO EVENING WALKS SAVE NOW AND THEN FOR A SHORT DISTANCE WITH MISSUS MAYLIE HE APPLIED HIMSELF WITH REDOUBLED ASSIDUITY TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE WHITE HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN AND LABOURED SO HARD THAT HIS QUICK PROGRESS SURPRISED EVEN HIMSELF
114-129317-0038 IT WAS WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN THIS PURSUIT THAT HE WAS GREATLY STARTLED AND DISTRESSED BY A MOST UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE THE LITTLE ROOM IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SIT WHEN BUSY AT HIS BOOKS
114-129317-0039 THAT CREPT OVER THE CASEMENT AND FILLED THE PLACE WITH THEIR DELICIOUS PERFUME IT LOOKED INTO A GARDEN WHENCE A WICKET GATE OPENED INTO A SMALL PADDOCK ALL BEYOND WAS FINE MEADOW LAND AND WOOD THERE WAS NO OTHER DWELLING NEAR IN THAT DIRECTION
114-129317-0040 AND THE PROSPECT IT COMMANDED WAS VERY EXTENSIVE ONE BEAUTIFUL EVENING WHEN THE FIRST SHADES OF TWILIGHT WERE BEGINNING TO SETTLE UPON THE EARTH OLIVER SAT AT THIS WINDOW INTENT UPON HIS BOOKS HE HAD BEEN PORING OVER THEM FOR SOME TIME
114-129317-0041 AND AS THE DAY HAD BEEN UNCOMMONLY SULTRY AND HE HAD EXERTED HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL IT IS NO DISPARAGEMENT TO THE AUTHORS WHOEVER THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TO SAY THAT GRADUALLY AND BY SLOW DEGREES HE FELL ASLEEP
114-129317-0042 THERE IS A KIND OF SLEEP THAT STEALS UPON US SOMETIMES WHICH WHILE IT HOLDS THE BODY PRISONER DOES NOT FREE THE MIND FROM A SENSE OF THINGS ABOUT IT AND ENABLE IT TO RAMBLE AT ITS PLEASURE SO FAR AS AN OVERPOWERING HEAVINESS A PROSTRATION OF STRENGTH
114-129317-0043 AND AN UTTER INABILITY TO CONTROL OUR THOUGHTS OR POWER OF MOTION CAN BE CALLED SLEEP THIS IS IT AND YET WE HAVE A CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT IS GOING ON ABOUT US AND IF WE DREAM AT SUCH A TIME WORDS WHICH ARE REALLY SPOKEN OR SOUNDS WHICH REALLY EXIST AT THE MOMENT
114-129317-0044 ACCOMMODATE THEMSELVES WITH SURPRISING READINESS TO OUR VISIONS UNTIL REALITY AND IMAGINATION BECOME SO STRANGELY BLENDED THAT IT IS AFTERWARDS ALMOST MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY TO SEPARATE THE TWO
114-129317-0045 NOR IS THIS THE MOST STRIKING PHENOMENON INCIDENTAL TO SUCH A STATE IT IS AN UNDOUBTED FACT THAT ALTHOUGH OUR SENSES OF TOUCH AND SIGHT BE FOR THE TIME DEAD YET OUR SLEEPING THOUGHTS AND THE VISIONARY SCENES THAT PASS BEFORE US
114-129317-0046 WILL BE INFLUENCED AND MATERIALLY INFLUENCED BY THE MERE SILENT PRESENCE OF SOME EXTERNAL OBJECT WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NEAR US WHEN WE CLOSED OUR EYES AND OF WHOSE VICINITY WE HAVE HAD NO WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS
114-129317-0047 OLIVER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE WAS IN HIS OWN LITTLE ROOM THAT HIS BOOKS WERE LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM THAT THE SWEET AIR WAS STIRRING AMONG THE CREEPING PLANTS OUTSIDE AND YET HE WAS ASLEEP SUDDENLY THE SCENE CHANGED
114-129317-0048 IF YOU BURIED HIM FIFTY FEET DEEP AND TOOK ME ACROSS HIS GRAVE I FANCY I SHOULD KNOW IF THERE WASN'T A MARK ABOVE IT
114-129317-0049 THERE THERE AT THE WINDOW CLOSE BEFORE HIM SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD HAVE ALMOST TOUCHED HIM BEFORE HE STARTED BACK WITH HIS EYES PEERING INTO THE ROOM AND MEETING HIS THERE STOOD THE JEW AND BESIDE HIM WHITE WITH RAGE OR FEAR OR BOTH
114-129317-0050 WERE THE SCOWLING FEATURES OF THE MAN WHO HAD ACCOSTED HIM IN THE INN YARD
