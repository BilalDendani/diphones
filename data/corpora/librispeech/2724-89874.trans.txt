2724-89874-0000 BRITAIN AN ISLAND IN THE ATLANTIC FORMERLY CALLED ALBION
2724-89874-0001 FACING THOUGH AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THE COASTS OF GERMANY FRANCE AND SPAIN WHICH FORM THE GREATEST PART OF EUROPE IT EXTENDS EIGHT HUNDRED MILES IN LENGTH TOWARDS THE NORTH
2724-89874-0002 AND IS TWO HUNDRED MILES IN BREADTH EXCEPT WHERE SEVERAL PROMONTORIES EXTEND FURTHER IN BREADTH BY WHICH ITS COMPASS IS MADE TO BE
2724-89874-0003 TO ITS NEAREST SHORE THERE IS AN EASY PASSAGE FROM THE CITY OF RUTUBI PORTUS
2724-89874-0004 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND WHERE IT OPENS UPON THE BOUNDLESS OCEAN IT HAS THE ISLANDS CALLED ORCADES BRITAIN IS RICH IN GRAIN AND TREES AND IS WELL ADAPTED FOR FEEDING CATTLE AND BEASTS OF BURDEN
2724-89874-0005 IT ALSO PRODUCES VINES IN SOME PLACES
2724-89874-0006 IT IS REMARKABLE ALSO FOR RIVERS ABOUNDING IN FISH AND PLENTIFUL SPRINGS IT HAS THE GREATEST PLENTY OF SALMON AND EELS SEALS ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY TAKEN AND DOLPHINS AS ALSO WHALES
2724-89874-0007 BESIDES MANY SORTS OF SHELL FISH SUCH AS MUSSELS IN WHICH ARE OFTEN FOUND EXCELLENT PEARLS OF ALL COLOURS RED PURPLE VIOLET AND GREEN BUT CHIEFLY WHITE THERE IS ALSO A GREAT ABUNDANCE OF SNAILS
2724-89874-0008 OF WHICH THE SCARLET DYE IS MADE A MOST BEAUTIFUL RED WHICH NEVER FADES WITH THE HEAT OF THE SUN OR EXPOSURE TO RAIN BUT THE OLDER IT IS THE MORE BEAUTIFUL IT BECOMES IT HAS BOTH SALT AND HOT SPRINGS
2724-89874-0009 AND FROM THEM FLOW RIVERS WHICH FURNISH HOT BATHS PROPER FOR ALL AGES AND BOTH SEXES IN SEPARATE PLACES ACCORDING TO THEIR REQUIREMENTS FOR WATER
2724-89874-0010 AND BECOMES NOT ONLY HOT BUT SCALDING BRITAIN IS RICH ALSO IN VEINS OF METALS AS COPPER IRON LEAD AND SILVER IT PRODUCES A GREAT DEAL OF EXCELLENT JET WHICH IS BLACK AND SPARKLING
2724-89874-0011 AND BURNS WHEN PUT TO THE FIRE AND WHEN SET ON FIRE DRIVES AWAY SERPENTS BEING WARMED WITH RUBBING IT ATTRACTS WHATEVER IS APPLIED TO IT LIKE AMBER THE ISLAND WAS FORMERLY DISTINGUISHED
2724-89874-0012 BY TWENTY EIGHT FAMOUS CITIES BESIDES INNUMERABLE FORTS WHICH WERE ALL STRONGLY SECURED WITH WALLS TOWERS GATES AND BARS AND BECAUSE IT LIES ALMOST UNDER THE NORTH POLE THE NIGHTS ARE LIGHT IN SUMMER
2724-89874-0013 SO THAT AT MIDNIGHT THE BEHOLDERS ARE OFTEN IN DOUBT WHETHER THE EVENING TWILIGHT STILL CONTINUES OR THAT OF THE MORNING HAS COME SINCE THE SUN AT NIGHT RETURNS TO THE EAST IN THE NORTHERN REGIONS WITHOUT PASSING FAR BENEATH THE EARTH
2724-89874-0014 FOR THIS REASON THE DAYS ARE OF A GREAT LENGTH IN SUMMER AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE NIGHTS IN WINTER ARE EIGHTEEN HOURS LONG FOR THE SUN THEN WITHDRAWS INTO SOUTHERN PARTS IN LIKE MANNER THE NIGHTS ARE VERY SHORT IN SUMMER
2724-89874-0015 AND THE DAYS IN WINTER THAT IS ONLY SIX EQUINOCTIAL HOURS WHEREAS IN ARMENIA MACEDONIA ITALY AND OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE SAME LATITUDE THE LONGEST DAY OR NIGHT EXTENDS BUT TO FIFTEEN HOURS
2724-89874-0016 AND THE SHORTEST TO NINE THERE ARE IN THE ISLAND AT PRESENT FOLLOWING THE NUMBER OF THE BOOKS IN WHICH THE DIVINE LAW WAS WRITTEN
2724-89874-0017 IN THE STUDY AND CONFESSION OF THE ONE SELF SAME KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS OF HIGHEST TRUTH AND TRUE SUBLIMITY TO WIT ENGLISH BRITISH SCOTTISH PICTISH AND LATIN
2724-89874-0018 THE LAST HAVING BECOME COMMON TO ALL BY THE STUDY OF THE SCRIPTURES BUT AT FIRST THIS ISLAND HAD NO OTHER INHABITANTS BUT THE BRITONS FROM WHOM IT DERIVED ITS NAME AND WHO
2724-89874-0019 STARTING FROM THE SOUTH THEY HAD OCCUPIED THE GREATER PART OF THE ISLAND WHEN IT HAPPENED THAT THE NATION OF THE PICTS
2724-89874-0020 IN A FEW SHIPS OF WAR AND BEING DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF BRITAIN CAME TO IRELAND AND LANDED ON ITS NORTHERN SHORES THERE FINDING THE NATION OF THE SCOTS THEY BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO SETTLE AMONG THEM
2724-89874-0021 BUT COULD NOT SUCCEED IN OBTAINING THEIR REQUEST IRELAND IS THE LARGEST ISLAND NEXT TO BRITAIN AND LIES TO THE WEST OF IT BUT AS IT IS SHORTER THAN BRITAIN TO THE NORTH SO ON THE OTHER HAND IT RUNS OUT FAR BEYOND IT TO THE SOUTH
2724-89874-0022 OVER AGAINST THE NORTHERN PART OF SPAIN THOUGH A WIDE SEA LIES BETWEEN THEM THE PICTS THEN AS HAS BEEN SAID ARRIVING IN THIS ISLAND BY SEA DESIRED TO HAVE A PLACE GRANTED THEM IN WHICH THEY MIGHT SETTLE
2724-89874-0023 COULD NOT CONTAIN THEM BOTH BUT WE CAN GIVE YOU GOOD COUNSEL SAID THEY WHEREBY YOU MAY KNOW WHAT TO DO WE KNOW THERE IS ANOTHER ISLAND NOT FAR FROM OURS TO THE EASTWARD WHICH WE OFTEN SEE AT A DISTANCE WHEN THE DAYS ARE CLEAR
2724-89874-0024 IF YOU WILL GO THITHER YOU CAN OBTAIN SETTLEMENTS OR IF ANY SHOULD OPPOSE YOU WE WILL HELP YOU THE PICTS ACCORDINGLY SAILING OVER INTO BRITAIN BEGAN TO INHABIT THE NORTHERN PARTS THEREOF
2724-89874-0025 FOR THE BRITONS HAD POSSESSED THEMSELVES OF THE SOUTHERN NOW THE PICTS HAD NO WIVES AND ASKED THEM OF THE SCOTS WHO WOULD NOT CONSENT TO GRANT THEM UPON ANY OTHER TERMS THAN THAT WHEN ANY QUESTION SHOULD ARISE
2724-89874-0026 THEY SHOULD CHOOSE A KING FROM THE FEMALE ROYAL RACE RATHER THAN FROM THE MALE WHICH CUSTOM AS IS WELL KNOWN
2724-89874-0027 BESIDES THE BRITONS AND THE PICTS RECEIVED A THIRD NATION THE SCOTS WHO MIGRATING FROM IRELAND UNDER THEIR LEADER REUDA EITHER BY FAIR MEANS OR BY FORCE OF ARMS SECURED TO THEMSELVES THOSE SETTLEMENTS AMONG THE PICTS WHICH THEY STILL POSSESS
2724-89874-0028 FROM THE NAME OF THEIR COMMANDER THEY ARE TO THIS DAY CALLED DALREUDINI
2724-89874-0029 FOR THE SNOW SCARCELY EVER LIES THERE ABOVE THREE DAYS NO MAN MAKES HAY IN THE SUMMER FOR WINTER'S PROVISION OR BUILDS STABLES FOR HIS BEASTS OF BURDEN NO REPTILES ARE FOUND THERE AND NO SNAKE CAN LIVE THERE FOR
2724-89874-0030 THOUGH SNAKES ARE OFTEN CARRIED THITHER OUT OF BRITAIN
2724-89874-0031 AND THE SCENT OF THE AIR REACHES THEM THEY DIE ON THE CONTRARY ALMOST ALL THINGS IN THE ISLAND ARE EFFICACIOUS AGAINST POISON IN TRUTH WE HAVE KNOWN THAT WHEN MEN HAVE BEEN BITTEN BY SERPENTS
2724-89874-0032 THE SCRAPINGS OF LEAVES OF BOOKS THAT WERE BROUGHT OUT OF IRELAND BEING PUT INTO WATER AND GIVEN THEM TO DRINK HAVE IMMEDIATELY ABSORBED THE SPREADING POISON AND ASSUAGED THE SWELLING THE ISLAND ABOUNDS IN MILK AND HONEY
2724-89874-0033 AND IT IS NOTED FOR THE HUNTING OF STAGS AND ROE DEER
2724-89874-0034 MIGRATING FROM THENCE AS HAS BEEN SAID
2724-89874-0035 IN ADDITION TO THE BRITONS AND THE PICTS THERE IS A VERY LARGE GULF OF THE SEA WHICH FORMERLY DIVIDED THE NATION OF THE BRITONS FROM THE PICTS
2724-89874-0036 HOW CAIUS JULIUS CAESAR WAS THE FIRST ROMAN THAT CAME INTO BRITAIN NOW BRITAIN HAD NEVER BEEN VISITED BY THE ROMANS AND WAS ENTIRELY UNKNOWN TO THEM BEFORE THE TIME OF CAIUS JULIUS CAESAR WHO
2724-89874-0037 WHILE HE WAS MAKING WAR UPON THE GERMANS AND THE GAULS WHO WERE DIVIDED ONLY BY THE RIVER RHINE
2724-89874-0038 WHENCE IS THE NEAREST AND SHORTEST PASSAGE INTO BRITAIN HERE HAVING PROVIDED ABOUT EIGHTY SHIPS OF BURDEN AND FAST SAILING VESSELS HE SAILED OVER INTO BRITAIN WHERE BEING FIRST ROUGHLY HANDLED IN A BATTLE AND THEN CAUGHT IN A STORM
2724-89874-0039 HE LOST A CONSIDERABLE PART OF HIS FLEET NO SMALL NUMBER OF FOOT SOLDIERS AND ALMOST ALL HIS CAVALRY RETURNING INTO GAUL HE PUT HIS LEGIONS INTO WINTER QUARTERS AND GAVE ORDERS FOR BUILDING SIX HUNDRED SAIL OF BOTH SORTS WITH THESE
2724-89874-0040 THE SHIPS RIDING AT ANCHOR WERE CAUGHT IN A STORM AND EITHER DASHED ONE AGAINST ANOTHER OR DRIVEN UPON THE SANDS AND WRECKED FORTY OF THEM WERE LOST THE REST WERE WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY REPAIRED
2724-89874-0041 CAESAR'S CAVALRY WAS AT THE FIRST ENCOUNTER DEFEATED BY THE BRITONS AND THERE LABIENUS THE TRIBUNE WAS SLAIN IN THE SECOND ENGAGEMENT WITH GREAT HAZARD TO HIS MEN HE DEFEATED THE BRITONS
2724-89874-0042 AND PUT THEM TO FLIGHT THENCE HE PROCEEDED TO THE RIVER THAMES WHERE A GREAT MULTITUDE OF THE ENEMY HAD POSTED THEMSELVES ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER
2724-89874-0043 AND ALMOST ALL THE FORD UNDER WATER WITH SHARP STAKES
2724-89874-0044 APPARENTLY ABOUT THE THICKNESS OF A MAN'S THIGH CASED WITH LEAD AND FIXED IMMOVABLY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER THIS BEING PERCEIVED AND AVOIDED BY THE ROMANS
2724-89874-0045 HID THEMSELVES IN THE WOODS WHENCE THEY GRIEVOUSLY HARASSED THE ROMANS WITH REPEATED SALLIES
2724-89874-0046 GIVING HIM FORTY HOSTAGES MANY OTHER CITIES FOLLOWING THEIR EXAMPLE MADE A TREATY WITH THE ROMANS GUIDED BY THEM CAESAR AT LENGTH AFTER SEVERE FIGHTING
2724-89874-0047 FORTIFIED BY SHELTERING WOODS AND PLENTIFULLY FURNISHED WITH ALL NECESSARIES
2724-89874-0048 BROUGHT THE ISLANDS ORCADES INTO SUBJECTION TO THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND VESPASIAN SENT BY HIM REDUCED THE ISLE OF WIGHT UNDER THE DOMINION OF THE ROMANS
2724-89874-0049 CLAUDIUS FOURTH EMPEROR FROM AUGUSTUS BEING DESIROUS TO APPROVE HIMSELF A PRINCE BENEFICIAL TO THE REPUBLIC AND EAGERLY BENT UPON WAR AND CONQUEST ON EVERY SIDE UNDERTOOK AN EXPEDITION INTO BRITAIN
2724-89874-0050 WHICH AS IT APPEARED WAS ROUSED TO REBELLION BY THE REFUSAL OF THE ROMANS TO GIVE UP CERTAIN DESERTERS NO ONE BEFORE OR AFTER JULIUS CAESAR HAD DARED TO LAND UPON THE ISLAND CLAUDIUS CROSSED OVER TO IT
2724-89874-0051 AND WITHIN A VERY FEW DAYS WITHOUT ANY FIGHTING OR BLOODSHED THE GREATER PART OF THE ISLAND WAS SURRENDERED INTO HIS HANDS HE ALSO ADDED TO THE ROMAN EMPIRE
2724-89874-0052 AND RETURNING TO ROME IN THE SIXTH MONTH AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HE GAVE HIS SON THE TITLE OF BRITANNICUS THIS WAR HE CONCLUDED IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN WHICH IS THE FORTY SIXTH
2724-89874-0053 IN WHICH YEAR THERE CAME TO PASS A MOST GRIEVOUS FAMINE IN SYRIA WHICH IS RECORDED IN THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES TO HAVE BEEN FORETOLD BY THE PROPHET AGABUS
2724-89874-0054 BEING SENT INTO BRITAIN BY THE SAME CLAUDIUS BROUGHT ALSO UNDER THE ROMAN DOMINION THE ISLE OF WIGHT WHICH IS CLOSE TO BRITAIN ON THE SOUTH AND IS ABOUT THIRTY MILES IN LENGTH FROM EAST TO WEST AND TWELVE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
2724-89874-0055 NERO SUCCEEDING CLAUDIUS IN THE EMPIRE
2724-89874-0056 AND THEREFORE AMONG COUNTLESS OTHER DISASTERS BROUGHT BY HIM UPON THE ROMAN STATE HE ALMOST LOST BRITAIN FOR IN HIS TIME TWO MOST NOTABLE TOWNS WERE THERE TAKEN AND DESTROYED
2724-89874-0057 WAS MADE EMPEROR TOGETHER WITH HIS BROTHER AURELIUS COMMODUS
2724-89874-0058 SENT A LETTER TO HIM ENTREATING THAT BY A MANDATE FROM HIM
2724-89874-0059 AND THE BRITONS PRESERVED THE FAITH WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED UNCORRUPTED AND ENTIRE IN PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY UNTIL THE TIME OF THE EMPEROR DIOCLETIAN
2724-89874-0060 DIVIDED FROM THE REST BY A RAMPART THAT PART OF BRITAIN WHICH HAD BEEN RECOVERED

2724-89874-0063 AND ENGAGED IN MANY WARS HE GOVERNED THE STATE VIGOROUSLY BUT WITH MUCH TROUBLE HAVING BEEN VICTORIOUS IN ALL THE GRIEVOUS CIVIL WARS WHICH HAPPENED IN HIS TIME HE WAS DRAWN INTO BRITAIN BY THE REVOLT OF ALMOST ALL THE CONFEDERATED TRIBES
2724-89874-0064 AND AFTER MANY GREAT AND SEVERE BATTLES HE THOUGHT FIT TO DIVIDE THAT PART OF THE ISLAND WHICH HE HAD RECOVERED FROM THE OTHER UNCONQUERED NATIONS
2724-89874-0065 BUT A RAMPART WITH WHICH CAMPS ARE FORTIFIED TO REPEL THE ASSAULTS OF ENEMIES IS MADE OF SODS CUT OUT OF THE EARTH AND RAISED HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND LIKE A WALL HAVING IN FRONT OF IT THE TRENCH WHENCE THE SODS WERE TAKEN

2724-89874-0071 BUT A MAN OF GREAT ABILITY AND ENERGY BEING APPOINTED TO GUARD THE SEA COASTS THEN INFESTED BY THE FRANKS AND SAXONS ACTED MORE TO THE PREJUDICE THAN TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE COMMONWEALTH
2724-89874-0072 BY NOT RESTORING TO ITS OWNERS ANY OF THE BOOTY TAKEN FROM THE ROBBERS BUT KEEPING ALL TO HIMSELF THUS GIVING RISE TO THE SUSPICION THAT BY INTENTIONAL NEGLECT HE SUFFERED THE ENEMY TO INFEST THE FRONTIERS WHEN THEREFORE AN ORDER WAS SENT BY MAXIMIAN

2724-89874-0079 AND FRUITFUL BRITAIN NOBLE ALBAN REARS THIS ALBAN BEING YET A PAGAN
2724-89874-0080 THIS MAN HE OBSERVED TO BE ENGAGED IN CONTINUAL PRAYER AND WATCHING DAY AND NIGHT WHEN ON A SUDDEN THE DIVINE GRACE SHINING ON HIM HE BEGAN TO IMITATE THE EXAMPLE OF FAITH AND PIETY WHICH WAS SET BEFORE HIM
2724-89874-0081 AND BEING GRADUALLY INSTRUCTED BY HIS WHOLESOME ADMONITIONS HE CAST OFF THE DARKNESS OF IDOLATRY AND BECAME A CHRISTIAN IN ALL SINCERITY OF HEART
2724-89874-0082 THAT A CONFESSOR OF CHRIST TO WHOM A MARTYR'S PLACE HAD NOT YET BEEN ASSIGNED
2724-89874-0083 WHEREUPON HE SENT SOME SOLDIERS TO MAKE A STRICT SEARCH AFTER HIM
2724-89874-0084 INSTEAD OF HIS GUEST AND MASTER
2724-89874-0085 AND LED BEFORE THE JUDGE IT HAPPENED THAT THE JUDGE AT THE TIME WHEN ALBAN WAS CARRIED BEFORE HIM WAS STANDING AT THE ALTAR AND OFFERING SACRIFICE TO DEVILS WHEN HE SAW ALBAN BEING MUCH ENRAGED THAT HE SHOULD THUS
2724-89874-0086 OF HIS OWN ACCORD DARE TO PUT HIMSELF INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOLDIERS AND INCUR SUCH DANGER ON BEHALF OF THE GUEST WHOM HE HAD HARBOURED HE COMMANDED HIM TO BE DRAGGED TO THE IMAGES OF THE DEVILS BEFORE WHICH HE STOOD SAYING
2724-89874-0087 BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO CONCEAL A REBELLIOUS AND SACRILEGIOUS MAN RATHER THAN TO DELIVER HIM UP TO THE SOLDIERS
2724-89874-0088 IF YOU SEEK TO ABANDON THE WORSHIP OF OUR RELIGION
2724-89874-0089 WAS NOT AT ALL DAUNTED BY THE PRINCE'S THREATS BUT PUTTING ON THE ARMOUR OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE PUBLICLY DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT OBEY HIS COMMAND THEN SAID THE JUDGE OF WHAT FAMILY OR RACE ARE YOU
2724-89874-0090 WHAT DOES IT CONCERN YOU ANSWERED ALBAN OF WHAT STOCK I AM IF YOU DESIRE TO HEAR THE TRUTH OF MY RELIGION BE IT KNOWN TO YOU THAT I AM NOW A CHRISTIAN AND FREE TO FULFIL CHRISTIAN DUTIES I ASK YOUR NAME SAID THE JUDGE

2724-89874-0092 DO NOT DELAY TO OFFER SACRIFICE TO THE GREAT GODS
2724-89874-0093 NEITHER CAN AVAIL THE WORSHIPPERS NOR FULFIL THE DESIRES AND PETITIONS OF THE SUPPLIANTS RATHER
2724-89874-0094 SHALL RECEIVE THE EVERLASTING PAINS OF HELL FOR HIS REWARD THE JUDGE HEARING THESE WORDS AND BEING MUCH INCENSED ORDERED THIS HOLY CONFESSOR OF GOD TO BE SCOURGED BY THE EXECUTIONERS
2724-89874-0095 HE BEING MOST CRUELLY TORTURED BORE THE SAME PATIENTLY OR RATHER JOYFULLY FOR OUR LORD'S SAKE WHEN THE JUDGE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE OVERCOME BY TORTURES OR WITHDRAWN FROM THE EXERCISE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION HE ORDERED HIM TO BE PUT TO DEATH
2724-89874-0096 BEING LED TO EXECUTION HE CAME TO A RIVER WHICH WITH A MOST RAPID COURSE RAN BETWEEN THE WALL OF THE TOWN AND THE ARENA
2724-89874-0097 AND OF DIVERS AGES AND CONDITIONS WHO WERE DOUBTLESS ASSEMBLED BY DIVINE INSPIRATION
2724-89874-0098 AND HAD SO FILLED THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER THAT HE COULD SCARCE PASS OVER THAT EVENING IN TRUTH ALMOST ALL HAD GONE OUT SO THAT THE JUDGE REMAINED IN THE CITY WITHOUT ATTENDANCE SAINT ALBAN THEREFORE URGED BY AN ARDENT AND DEVOUT WISH TO ATTAIN THE SOONER TO MARTYRDOM
2724-89874-0099 WHEREUPON THE CHANNEL WAS IMMEDIATELY DRIED UP AND HE PERCEIVED THAT THE WATER HAD GIVEN PLACE AND MADE WAY FOR HIM TO PASS AMONG THE REST THE EXECUTIONER WHO SHOULD HAVE PUT HIM TO DEATH OBSERVED THIS AND MOVED DOUBTLESS BY DIVINE INSPIRATION
2724-89874-0100 HASTENED TO MEET HIM AT THE APPOINTED PLACE OF EXECUTION
2724-89874-0101 FELL AT HIS FEET PRAYING EARNESTLY THAT HE MIGHT RATHER BE ACCOUNTED WORTHY TO SUFFER WITH THE MARTYR WHOM HE WAS ORDERED TO EXECUTE OR IF POSSIBLE INSTEAD OF HIM WHILST HE WAS THUS CHANGED FROM A PERSECUTOR
2724-89874-0102 THE HOLY CONFESSOR ACCOMPANIED BY THE MULTITUDE
2724-89874-0103 BEAUTIFUL AS WAS FITTING AND OF MOST PLEASING APPEARANCE ADORNED OR RATHER CLOTHED EVERYWHERE WITH FLOWERS OF MANY COLOURS NOWHERE STEEP OR PRECIPITOUS OR OF SHEER DESCENT BUT WITH A LONG SMOOTH NATURAL SLOPE
2724-89874-0104 LIKE A PLAIN ON ITS SIDES A PLACE ALTOGETHER WORTHY FROM OF OLD
2724-89874-0105 AND IMMEDIATELY A LIVING SPRING
2724-89874-0106 SO THAT ALL MEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT EVEN THE STREAM HAD YIELDED ITS SERVICE TO THE MARTYR
2724-89874-0107 WHO HAD LEFT NO WATER REMAINING IN THE RIVER SHOULD DESIRE IT ON THE TOP OF THE HILL UNLESS HE THOUGHT IT FITTING THE RIVER THEN HAVING DONE SERVICE AND FULFILLED THE PIOUS DUTY RETURNED TO ITS NATURAL COURSE
2724-89874-0108 THEREFORE THE HEAD OF THE UNDAUNTED MARTYR WAS STRUCK OFF
2724-89874-0109 WHICH GOD HAS PROMISED TO THEM THAT LOVE HIM
2724-89874-0110 WAS NOT PERMITTED TO REJOICE OVER HIS DEAD BODY FOR HIS EYES DROPPED UPON THE GROUND AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE BLESSED MARTYR'S HEAD FELL AT THE SAME TIME WAS ALSO BEHEADED THE SOLDIER WHO BEFORE THROUGH THE DIVINE ADMONITION
2724-89874-0111 REFUSED TO STRIKE THE HOLY CONFESSOR OF WHOM IT IS APPARENT THAT THOUGH HE WAS NOT PURIFIED BY THE WATERS OF BAPTISM YET HE WAS CLEANSED BY THE WASHING OF HIS OWN BLOOD AND RENDERED WORTHY TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
2724-89874-0112 AND BEGAN TO HONOUR THE DEATH OF THE SAINTS BY WHICH HE ONCE THOUGHT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN TURNED FROM THEIR ZEAL FOR THE CHRISTIAN FAITH
2724-89874-0113 VERLAMACAESTIR OR
2724-89874-0114 WHERE AFTERWARDS WHEN PEACEABLE CHRISTIAN TIMES WERE RESTORED A CHURCH OF WONDERFUL WORKMANSHIP AND ALTOGETHER WORTHY
2724-89874-0115 WHO AFTER THAT THEY HAD ENDURED SUNDRY TORMENTS AND THEIR LIMBS HAD BEEN MANGLED AFTER AN UNHEARD OF MANNER WHEN THEIR WARFARE WAS ACCOMPLISHED
2724-89874-0116 WHEN THE PERSECUTION CEASED THE CHURCH IN BRITAIN ENJOYED PEACE TILL THE TIME OF THE ARIAN HERESY WHEN THE STORM OF PERSECUTION CEASED THE FAITHFUL CHRISTIANS
2724-89874-0117 WHO DURING THE TIME OF DANGER HAD HIDDEN THEMSELVES IN WOODS AND DESERTS AND SECRET CAVES CAME FORTH AND REBUILT THE CHURCHES WHICH HAD BEEN LEVELLED TO THE GROUND FOUNDED ERECTED AND FINISHED THE CATHEDRALS
2724-89874-0118 RAISED IN HONOUR OF THE HOLY MARTYRS AND AS IF DISPLAYING THEIR CONQUERING STANDARDS IN ALL PLACES CELEBRATED FESTIVALS AND PERFORMED THEIR SACRED RITES WITH PURE HEARTS AND LIPS THIS PEACE CONTINUED IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES OF BRITAIN
2724-89874-0119 UNTIL THE TIME OF THE ARIAN MADNESS WHICH HAVING CORRUPTED THE WHOLE WORLD INFECTED THIS ISLAND ALSO SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH THE POISON OF ITS ERROR AND WHEN ONCE A WAY WAS OPENED ACROSS THE SEA FOR THAT PLAGUE
2724-89874-0120 STRAIGHTWAY ALL THE TAINT OF EVERY HERESY FELL UPON THE ISLAND EVER DESIROUS TO HEAR SOME NEW THING AND NEVER HOLDING FIRM TO ANY SURE BELIEF
2724-89874-0121 WHILST DIOCLETIAN WAS ALIVE GOVERNED GAUL AND SPAIN A MAN OF GREAT CLEMENCY AND URBANITY DIED IN BRITAIN
2724-89874-0122 EMPEROR OF THE GAULS EUTROPIUS WRITES THAT CONSTANTINE BEING CREATED EMPEROR IN BRITAIN SUCCEEDED HIS FATHER IN THE SOVEREIGNTY IN HIS TIME THE ARIAN HERESY BROKE OUT
2724-89874-0123 THE DEADLY POISON OF ITS EVIL SPREAD AS HAS BEEN SAID TO THE CHURCHES IN THE ISLANDS
