8015-112691-0000 THREE JAMES UNABLE TO RESIST SO STRONG A COMBINATION AS THAT OF HIS PEOPLE HIS PARLIAMENT HIS SON AND HIS FAVORITE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO EMBRACE MEASURES FOR WHICH
8015-112691-0001 FROM TEMPER AS WELL AS JUDGMENT HE HAD EVER ENTERTAINED A MOST SETTLED AVERSION
8015-112691-0002 AND WHOM HE CONSIDERED AS THE AUTHOR BOTH OF THE PRINCE'S JOURNEY TO SPAIN AND OF THE BREACH OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY THE ARRIVAL OF BRISTOL HE IMPATIENTLY LONGED FOR
8015-112691-0003 AND IT WAS BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THAT MINISTER WHOSE WISDOM HE RESPECTED AND WHOSE VIEWS HE APPROVED THAT HE HOPED IN TIME TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM HIS PRESENT DIFFICULTIES DURING THE PRINCE'S ABODE IN SPAIN
8015-112691-0004 THAT ABLE NEGOTIATOR HAD EVER OPPOSED THOUGH UNSUCCESSFULLY TO THE IMPETUOUS MEASURES SUGGESTED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS OWN WISE AND WELL TEMPERED COUNSELS AFTER CHARLES'S DEPARTURE
8015-112691-0005 HE STILL UPON THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF A CHANGE OF RESOLUTION INTERPOSED HIS ADVICE AND STRENUOUSLY INSISTED ON THE SINCERITY OF THE SPANIARDS IN THE CONDUCT OF THE TREATY AS WELL AS THE ADVANTAGES WHICH ENGLAND MUST REAP FROM THE COMPLETION OF IT
8015-112691-0006 ENRAGED TO FIND THAT HIS SUCCESSFUL LABORS SHOULD BE RENDERED ABORTIVE BY THE LEVITIES AND CAPRICES OF AN INSOLENT MINION HE WOULD UNDERSTAND NO HINTS
8015-112691-0007 AND NOTHING BUT EXPRESS ORDERS FROM HIS MASTER COULD ENGAGE HIM TO MAKE THAT DEMAND WHICH HE WAS SENSIBLE MUST PUT A FINAL PERIOD TO THE TREATY HE WAS NOT THEREFORE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT BUCKINGHAM HAD DECLARED HIMSELF
8015-112691-0008 HIS OPEN ENEMY AND ON ALL OCCASIONS HAD THROWN OUT MANY VIOLENT REFLECTIONS AGAINST HIM NOTHING COULD BE OF GREATER CONSEQUENCE TO BUCKINGHAM THAN TO KEEP BRISTOL AT A DISTANCE BOTH FROM THE KING AND THE PARLIAMENT
8015-112691-0009 LEST THE POWER OF TRUTH ENFORCED BY SO WELL INFORMED A SPEAKER SHOULD OPEN SCENES WHICH WERE BUT SUSPECTED BY THE FORMER AND OF WHICH THE LATTER HAD AS YET ENTERTAINED NO MANNER OF JEALOUSY
8015-112691-0010 HE APPLIED THEREFORE TO JAMES WHOSE WEAKNESS DISGUISED TO HIMSELF UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF FINESSE AND DISSIMULATION WAS NOW BECOME ABSOLUTELY INCURABLE
8015-112691-0011 A WARRANT FOR SENDING BRISTOL TO THE TOWER WAS ISSUED IMMEDIATELY UPON HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND AND THOUGH HE WAS SOON RELEASED FROM CONFINEMENT YET ORDERS WERE CARRIED HIM FROM THE KING TO RETIRE TO HIS COUNTRY SEAT
8015-112691-0012 AND TO ABSTAIN FROM ALL ATTENDANCE IN PARLIAMENT HE OBEYED BUT LOUDLY DEMANDED AN OPPORTUNITY OF JUSTIFYING HIMSELF AND OF LAYING HIS WHOLE CONDUCT BEFORE HIS MASTER ON ALL OCCASIONS HE PROTESTED HIS INNOCENCE
8015-112691-0013 AND THREW ON HIS ENEMY THE BLAME OF EVERY MISCARRIAGE BUCKINGHAM AND AT HIS INSTIGATION THE PRINCE DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD BE RECONCILED TO BRISTOL IF HE WOULD BUT ACKNOWLEDGE HIS ERRORS AND ILL CONDUCT
8015-112691-0014 BUT THE SPIRITED NOBLEMAN JEALOUS OF HIS HONOR REFUSED TO BUY FAVOR AT SO HIGH A PRICE JAMES HAD THE EQUITY TO SAY THAT THE INSISTING ON THAT CONDITION WAS A STRAIN OF UNEXAMPLED TYRANNY BUT BUCKINGHAM SCRUPLED NOT TO ASSERT
8015-112691-0015 WITH HIS USUAL PRESUMPTION THAT NEITHER THE KING THE PRINCE NOR HIMSELF WERE AS YET SATISFIED OF BRISTOL'S INNOCENCE WHILE THE ATTACHMENT OF THE PRINCE TO BUCKINGHAM WHILE THE TIMIDITY OF JAMES OR THE SHAME OF CHANGING HIS FAVORITE
8015-112691-0016 KEPT THE WHOLE COURT IN AWE THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR INOIOSA ENDEAVORED TO OPEN THE KING'S EYES AND TO CURE HIS FEARS BY INSTILLING GREATER FEARS INTO HIM HE PRIVATELY SLIPPED INTO HIS HAND A PAPER AND GAVE HIM A SIGNAL TO READ IT ALONE
8015-112691-0017 THAT THE PRINCE AND BUCKINGHAM HAD CONSPIRED TOGETHER AND HAD THE WHOLE COURT AT THEIR DEVOTION THAT CABALS AMONG THE POPULAR LEADERS IN PARLIAMENT WERE CARRYING ON TO THE EXTREME PREJUDICE OF HIS AUTHORITY THAT THE PROJECT WAS TO CONFINE HIM TO SOME OF HIS HUNTING SEATS
8015-112691-0018 WERE FOUNDED ON THE SYSTEM OF ENMITY TO THE AUSTRIAN FAMILY
8015-112691-0019 THE STATES OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WERE AT THIS TIME GOVERNED BY MAURICE AND THAT ASPIRING PRINCE SENSIBLE THAT HIS CREDIT WOULD LANGUISH DURING PEACE HAD ON THE EXPIRATION OF THE TWELVE YEARS TRUCE
8015-112691-0020 RENEWED THE WAR WITH THE SPANISH MONARCHY HIS GREAT CAPACITY IN THE MILITARY ART WOULD HAVE COMPENSATED THE INFERIORITY OF HIS FORCES HAD NOT THE SPANISH ARMIES BEEN COMMANDED BY SPINOLA
8015-112691-0021 A GENERAL EQUALLY RENOWNED FOR CONDUCT AND MORE CELEBRATED FOR ENTERPRISE AND ACTIVITY IN SUCH A SITUATION NOTHING COULD BE MORE WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC THAN THE PROSPECT OF A RUPTURE BETWEEN JAMES AND THE CATHOLIC KING
8015-112691-0022 AND THEY FLATTERED THEMSELVES AS WELL FROM THE NATURAL UNION OF INTERESTS BETWEEN THEM AND ENGLAND AS FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE THAT POWERFUL SUCCORS WOULD SOON MARCH TO THEIR RELIEF
8015-112691-0023 ACCORDINGLY AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN WAS LEVIED IN ENGLAND AND SENT OVER TO HOLLAND COMMANDED BY FOUR YOUNG NOBLEMEN ESSEX OXFORD SOUTHAMPTON AND WILLOUGHBY
8015-112691-0024 WHO WERE AMBITIOUS OF DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES IN SO POPULAR A CAUSE AND OF ACQUIRING MILITARY EXPERIENCE UNDER SO RENOWNED A CAPTAIN AS MAURICE
8015-112691-0025 THE SAME ALLUREMENTS HAD NOT HERE PLACE WHICH HAD SO LONG ENTANGLED HIM IN THE SPANISH NEGOTIATION THE PORTION PROMISED WAS MUCH INFERIOR AND THE PEACEABLE RESTORATION OF THE PALATINE COULD NOT THENCE BE EXPECTED
8015-112691-0026 BUT JAMES WAS AFRAID LEST HIS SON SHOULD BE ALTOGETHER DISAPPOINTED OF A BRIDE AND THEREFORE AS SOON AS THE FRENCH KING DEMANDED FOR THE HONOR OF HIS CROWN THE SAME TERMS WHICH HAD BEEN GRANTED TO THE SPANISH HE WAS PREVAILED WITH TO COMPLY
8015-112691-0027 AND AS THE PRINCE DURING HIS ABODE IN SPAIN HAD GIVEN A VERBAL PROMISE TO ALLOW THE INFANTA THE EDUCATION OF HER CHILDREN TILL THE AGE OF THIRTEEN THIS ARTICLE WAS HERE INSERTED IN THE TREATY
8015-112691-0028 AND TO THAT IMPRUDENCE IS GENERALLY IMPUTED THE PRESENT DISTRESSED CONDITION OF HIS POSTERITY THE COURT OF ENGLAND HOWEVER IT MUST BE CONFESSED ALWAYS PRETENDED EVEN IN THEIR MEMORIALS TO THE FRENCH COURT THAT ALL THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS GRANTED TO THE CATHOLICS
8015-112691-0029 AND FROM HIS OWN INCAPACITY FOR SUCH A SCENE OF ACTION DURING THE SPANISH NEGOTIATION HEIDELBERG AND MANHEIM HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE IMPERIAL FORCES AND FRANKENDALE THOUGH THE GARRISON WAS ENTIRELY ENGLISH WAS CLOSELY BESIEGED BY THEM
8015-112691-0030 AFTER REITERATED REMONSTRANCES FROM JAMES SPAIN INTERPOSED AND PROCURED A SUSPENSION OF ARMS DURING EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT AS FRANKENDALE WAS THE ONLY PLACE OF FREDERIC'S ANCIENT DOMINIONS WHICH WAS STILL IN HIS HANDS
8015-112691-0031 AND OF LEAVING THAT STATE IN SECURITY WAS UNWILLING THAT SO IMPORTANT A FORTRESS SHOULD REMAIN IN THE POSSESSION OF THE ENEMY TO COMPROMISE ALL DIFFERENCES IT WAS AGREED TO SEQUESTRATE IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE INFANTA AS A NEUTRAL PERSON
8015-112691-0032 UPON CONDITION THAT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE TRUCE IT SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO FREDERIC THOUGH PEACE SHOULD NOT AT THAT TIME BE CONCLUDED BETWEEN HIM AND FERDINAND AFTER THE UNEXPECTED RUPTURE WITH SPAIN THE INFANTA
8015-112691-0033 WHEN JAMES DEMANDED THE EXECUTION OF THE TREATY OFFERED HIM PEACEABLE POSSESSION OF FRANKENDALE AND EVEN PROMISED A SAFE CONDUCT FOR THE GARRISON THROUGH THE SPANISH NETHERLANDS BUT THERE WAS SOME TERRITORY OF THE EMPIRE INTERPOSED
8015-112691-0034 AND FOR PASSAGE OVER THAT TERRITORY NO TERMS WERE STIPULATED BY THIS CHICANE WHICH CERTAINLY HAD NOT BEEN EMPLOYED
8015-112691-0035 COUNT MANSFELDT WAS TAKEN INTO PAY AND AN ENGLISH ARMY OF TWELVE THOUSAND FOOT AND TWO HUNDRED HORSE WAS LEVIED BY A GENERAL PRESS THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM DURING THE NEGOTIATION WITH FRANCE VAST PROMISES HAD BEEN MADE
8015-112691-0036 THOUGH IN GENERAL TERMS BY THE FRENCH MINISTRY NOT ONLY THAT A FREE PASSAGE SHOULD BE GRANTED TO THE ENGLISH TROOPS
8015-112691-0037 IN ENGLAND ALL THESE PROFESSIONS WERE HASTILY INTERPRETED TO BE POSITIVE ENGAGEMENTS THE TROOPS UNDER MANSFELDT'S COMMAND WERE EMBARKED AT DOVER BUT UPON SAILING OVER TO CALAIS FOUND NO ORDERS YET ARRIVED FOR THEIR ADMISSION
8015-112691-0038 AFTER WAITING IN VAIN DURING SOME TIME THEY WERE OBLIGED TO SAIL TOWARDS ZEALAND WHERE IT HAD ALSO BEEN NEGLECTED TO CONCERT PROPER MEASURES FOR THEIR DISEMBARKATION AND SOME SCRUPLES AROSE AMONG THE STATES ON ACCOUNT OF THE SCARCITY OF PROVISIONS
8015-112691-0039 SO LONG COOPED UP IN NARROW VESSELS HALF THE ARMY DIED WHILE ON BOARD AND THE OTHER HALF WEAKENED BY SICKNESS
8015-112691-0040 THAT REIGN WAS NOW DRAWING TOWARDS A CONCLUSION WITH PEACE SO SUCCESSFULLY CULTIVATED AND SO PASSIONATELY LOVED BY THIS MONARCH HIS LIFE ALSO TERMINATED
8015-112691-0041 AND WHEN ENCOURAGED BY HIS COURTIERS WITH THE COMMON PROVERB THAT SUCH A DISTEMPER DURING THAT SEASON WAS HEALTH FOR A KING HE REPLIED THAT THE PROVERB WAS MEANT OF A YOUNG KING AFTER SOME FITS HE FOUND HIMSELF EXTREMELY WEAKENED
8015-112691-0042 AND SENT FOR THE PRINCE WHOM HE EXHORTED TO BEAR A TENDER AFFECTION FOR HIS WIFE BUT TO PRESERVE A CONSTANCY IN RELIGION TO PROTECT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND TO EXTEND HIS CARE TOWARDS THE UNHAPPY FAMILY OF THE PALATINE
8015-112691-0043 WITH DECENCY AND COURAGE HE PREPARED HIMSELF FOR HIS END AND HE EXPIRED ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF MARCH AFTER A REIGN OVER ENGLAND OF TWENTY TWO YEARS AND SOME DAYS AND IN THE FIFTY NINTH YEAR OF HIS AGE
8015-112691-0044 HIS GENEROSITY BORDERED ON PROFUSION HIS LEARNING ON PEDANTRY HIS PACIFIC DISPOSITION ON PUSILLANIMITY HIS WISDOM ON CUNNING HIS FRIENDSHIP ON LIGHT FANCY AND BOYISH FONDNESS
8015-112691-0045 WHILE HE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS ONLY MAINTAINING HIS OWN AUTHORITY HE MAY PERHAPS BE SUSPECTED IN A FEW OF HIS ACTIONS AND STILL MORE OF HIS PRETENSIONS TO HAVE SOMEWHAT ENCROACHED ON THE LIBERTIES OF HIS PEOPLE
8015-112691-0046 WHILE HE ENDEAVORED BY AN EXACT NEUTRALITY TO ACQUIRE THE GOOD WILL OF ALL HIS NEIGHBORS HE WAS ABLE TO PRESERVE FULLY THE ESTEEM AND REGARD OF NONE HIS CAPACITY WAS CONSIDERABLE
8015-112691-0047 BUT FITTER TO DISCOURSE ON GENERAL MAXIMS THAN TO CONDUCT ANY INTRICATE BUSINESS HIS INTENTIONS WERE JUST BUT MORE ADAPTED TO THE CONDUCT OF PRIVATE LIFE THAN TO THE GOVERNMENT OF KINGDOMS
8015-112691-0048 AWKWARD IN HIS PERSON AND UNGAINLY IN HIS MANNERS HE WAS ILL QUALIFIED TO COMMAND RESPECT PARTIAL AND UNDISCERNING IN HIS AFFECTIONS HE WAS LITTLE FITTED TO ACQUIRE GENERAL LOVE
8015-112691-0049 OF A FEEBLE TEMPER MORE THAN OF A FRAIL JUDGMENT EXPOSED TO OUR RIDICULE FROM HIS VANITY BUT EXEMPT FROM OUR HATRED BY HIS FREEDOM FROM PRIDE AND ARROGANCE AND UPON THE WHOLE IT MAY BE PRONOUNCED OF HIS CHARACTER
8015-112691-0050 THAT ALL HIS QUALITIES WERE SULLIED WITH WEAKNESS AND EMBELLISHED BY HUMANITY OF POLITICAL COURAGE HE CERTAINLY WAS DESTITUTE AND THENCE CHIEFLY IS DERIVED THE STRONG PREJUDICE WHICH PREVAILS AGAINST HIS PERSONAL BRAVERY
8015-112691-0051 AN INFERENCE HOWEVER WHICH MUST BE OWNED FROM GENERAL EXPERIENCE TO BE EXTREMELY FALLACIOUS HE WAS ONLY ONCE MARRIED TO ANNE OF DENMARK WHO DIED ON THE THIRD OF MARCH SIXTEEN NINETEEN
8015-112691-0052 IN THE FORTY FIFTH YEAR OF HER AGE A WOMAN EMINENT NEITHER FOR HER VICES NOR HER VIRTUES SHE LOVED SHOWS AND EXPENSIVE AMUSEMENTS BUT POSSESSED LITTLE TASTE IN HER PLEASURES A GREAT COMET APPEARED ABOUT THE TIME OF HER DEATH
8015-112691-0053 AND THE VULGAR ESTEEMED IT THE PROGNOSTIC OF THAT EVENT SO CONSIDERABLE IN THEIR EYES ARE EVEN THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT PRINCES HE LEFT ONLY ONE SON CHARLES THEN IN THE TWENTY FIFTH YEAR OF HIS AGE
8015-112691-0054 AND ONE DAUGHTER ELIZABETH MARRIED TO THE ELECTOR PALATINE SHE WAS AGED TWENTY NINE YEARS THOSE ALONE REMAINED OF SIX LEGITIMATE CHILDREN BORN TO HIM HE NEVER HAD ANY ILLEGITIMATE
8015-112691-0055 AND HE NEVER DISCOVERED ANY TENDENCY EVEN THE SMALLEST TOWARDS A PASSION FOR ANY MISTRESS THE ARCHBISHOPS OF CANTERBURY DURING THIS REIGN WERE WHITGIFT WHO DIED IN SIXTEEN O FOUR BANCROFT IN SIXTEEN TEN

8015-112691-0060 WERE SEVENTY EIGHT TEMPORAL PEERS THE NUMBERS IN THE FIRST PARLIAMENT OF CHARLES WERE NINETY SEVEN CONSEQUENTLY JAMES DURING THAT PERIOD CREATED NINETEEN NEW PEERAGES ABOVE THOSE THAT EXPIRED
8015-112691-0061 THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN THE FIRST PARLIAMENT OF THIS REIGN CONSISTED OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MEMBERS IT APPEARS THAT FOUR BOROUGHS REVIVED THEIR CHARTERS WHICH THEY HAD FORMERLY NEGLECTED
