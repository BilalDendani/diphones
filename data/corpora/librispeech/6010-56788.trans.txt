6010-56788-0000 WOMEN IN PHYSICS PHYSICS BEING ONE OF THE INDUCTIVE SCIENCES RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION UNTIL MODERN TIMES TRUE THE GREEKS WERE FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FACTS OF THE MECHANICS OF SOLIDS AND FLUIDS
6010-56788-0001 WERE AMONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INVESTIGATORS OF THEIR TIME RESPECTING THE LAWS AND PROPERTIES OF MATTER AND CONTRIBUTED MATERIALLY TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE PHENOMENA OF THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE BUT THE SUM TOTAL OF THEIR INFORMATION OF WHAT WE NOW KNOW AS PHYSICS
6010-56788-0002 COULD BE EMBODIED IN A FEW PAGES IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING FACTS WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT TO FIND WOMEN ENGAGED IN THE STUDY MUCH LESS IN THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DURING ANCIENT TIMES AND YET IF WE ARE TO CREDIT BOCCACCIO
6010-56788-0003 WHO BASES HIS STATEMENTS ON THOSE OF EARLY GREEK WRITERS THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE WOMAN THAT WON DISTINCTION BY HER KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AS EARLY AS THE DAYS OF SOCRATES IN HIS WORK DE LAUDIBUS MULIERUM
6010-56788-0004 WHICH TREATS OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF SOME OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GENTLER SEX
6010-56788-0005 AND IS REPRESENTED AS BEING A VERITABLE PRODIGY OF LEARNING FOR AMONG HER MANY CLAIMS TO DISTINCTION SHE IS SAID TO HAVE PUBLICLY TAUGHT NATURAL AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES OF ATTICA FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS TO HAVE WRITTEN FORTY BOOKS
6010-56788-0006 AND REFLECT ON THE ADVANTAGES THEY ENJOYED AS PUPILS OF THE ABLEST TEACHERS OF THE LYCEUM THE PORTICO AND THE ACADEMY WHEN WE REMEMBER FURTHER THAT THEY LIVED IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF INTELLIGENCE SUCH AS HAS SINCE BEEN UNKNOWN
6010-56788-0007 WHEN WE PERUSE THE FRAGMENTARY NOTICES OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS AS RECORDED IN THE PAGES OF MORE RECENT INVESTIGATORS REGARDING THE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF WOMEN LIVING IN ATHENS AND THE EMINENCE WHICH THEY ATTAINED IN SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE
6010-56788-0008 AND AS A TEACHER HAVE NOT BEEN OVERESTIMATED LIVING IN AN AGE OF PRODIGIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WHEN WOMEN AS WELL AS MEN WERE ACTUATED BY AN ABIDING LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE
6010-56788-0009 TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S SCHOOL AFTER HIS DEATH AND DOES NOT ANTIQUITY CREDIT HER WITH BEING NOT ONLY A SUCCESSFUL TEACHER OF PHILOSOPHY BUT ALSO A WRITER OF BOOKS OF RECOGNIZED VALUE
6010-56788-0010 AND ABOUT HER EMINENCE AS A TEACHER OF SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY SHE WAS BUT ONE OF MANY OF THE GREEK WOMEN OF HER AGE THAT WON RENOWN BY THEIR GIFTS OF INTELLECT AND BY THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THEIR TIME AND COUNTRY
6010-56788-0011 SHE TOO LIKE HER DISTINGUISHED PREDECESSOR IN ATHENS WAS AN INSTRUCTOR IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY
6010-56788-0012 OF HER WE KNOW MORE THAN WE DO OF THE DAUGHTER OF ARISTIPPUS BUT EVEN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACQUISITIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF HYPATIA IS UNFORTUNATELY EXTREMELY MEAGER WE DO HOWEVER KNOW FROM THE HISTORIAN SOCRATES AND FROM SYNESIUS BISHOP OF PTOLEMAIS
6010-56788-0013 WHO WAS HER PUPIL THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THE MOST RICHLY DOWERED WOMEN OF ALL TIME BORN AND EDUCATED IN ALEXANDRIA WHEN ITS SCHOOLS AND SCHOLARS WERE THE MOST CELEBRATED IN THE WORLD
6010-56788-0014 SHE WAS EVEN AT AN EARLY AGE REGARDED AS A MARVEL OF LEARNING FOR
6010-56788-0015 OF WHICH HE WAS A DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR SHE AS SUIDAS INFORMS US DEVOTED HERSELF TO THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT SHE WAS SOON REGARDED AS THE ABLEST LIVING EXPONENT OF THE DOCTRINES OF PLATO AND ARISTOTLE HER KNOWLEDGE
6010-56788-0016 SHE HAD A WELL EQUIPPED PHYSICAL CABINET IN WHICH SHE TOOK SPECIAL DELIGHT BUT IN HER TIME AS IN THAT OF HYPATIA NATURAL PHILOSOPHY WAS FAR FROM BEING THE BROAD EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE
6010-56788-0017 WHICH IT HAS BECOME THROUGH THE MARVELOUS DISCOVERIES MADE IN HEAT LIGHT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM DURING THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS AS WELL AS THROUGH THOSE COUNTLESS BRILLIANT INVESTIGATIONS WHICH HAVE LED UP TO OUR PRESENT DOCTRINE OF THE CORRELATION AND CONSERVATION
6010-56788-0018 OF THE VARIOUS PHYSICAL FORCES THERE WAS THEN NO OCCASION FOR THOSE DELICATE INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION WHICH ARE NOW FOUND IN EVERY PHYSICAL LABORATORY BY MEANS OF WHICH THE MAN OF SCIENCE
6010-56788-0019 IS ABLE TO INVESTIGATE PHENOMENA AND DETERMINE LAWS THAT WERE QUITE UNKNOWN UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO
6010-56788-0020 PHILOSOPHIAE NATURALIS PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA THE MARQUISE'S FIRST SCIENTIFIC WORK WAS AN INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE NATURE OF FIRE THE FRENCH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES HAD OFFERED A PRIZE FOR THE BEST MEMOIR ON THE SUBJECT
6010-56788-0021 LEONARD EULER THE MARQUISE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN THE CONTEST BUT HER PAPER WAS OF SUCH VALUE THAT THE EMINENT PHYSICIST AND ASTRONOMER ARAGO WAS ABLE TO CHARACTERIZE IT AS AN ELEGANT PIECE OF WORK
6010-56788-0022 ARE BOTH MODES OF MOTION THE SECOND BOOK WRITTEN BY THIS REMARKABLE WOMAN IS ENTITLED INSTITUTIONS DE PHYSIQUE AND WAS DEDICATED TO HER SON FOR WHOSE BENEFIT IT WAS PRIMARILY WRITTEN
6010-56788-0023 IT DEALS SPECIALLY WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF LEIBNITZ AND DISCUSSES SUCH QUESTIONS AS FORCE TIME AND SPACE HER VIEWS RESPECTING THE NATURE OF THE FORCE CALLED VIS VIVA WHICH WAS MUCH DISCUSSED IN HER TIME
6010-56788-0024 ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST AS THEY ARE NOT ONLY OPPOSED TO THOSE WHICH WERE HELD BY DESCARTES AND NEWTON BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY ARE IN ESSENTIAL ACCORD WITH THOSE NOW ACCEPTED IN THE WORLD OF SCIENCE ALL THINGS CONSIDERED
6010-56788-0025 LAURA MARIA CATARINA BASSI
6010-56788-0026 AND FROM HER MOST TENDER YEARS SHE EXHIBITED AN EXCEPTIONAL FACILITY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE AFTER SHE HAD THROUGH THE ASSISTANCE OF EXCELLENT MASTERS BECOME PROFICIENT IN FRENCH AND LATIN
6010-56788-0027 HER ENTERING THE LISTS AGAINST SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SCHOLARS OF THE TIME WAS MADE THE OCCASION FOR AN UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION IN HER HONOR
6010-56788-0028 WHEN THE ARGUMENTATION BEGAN THE YOUNG GIRL FOUND HERSELF PITTED AGAINST FIVE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SCHOLARS OF BOLOGNA BUT SHE WAS FULLY EQUAL TO THE OCCASION AND PASSED THE ORDEAL TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED
6010-56788-0029 IN A MANNER THAT EXCITED THE ADMIRATION AND WON THE PLAUDITS OF ALL PRESENT CARDINAL LAMBERTINI WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THE BRILLIANT DEFENCE WHICH SHE HAD MADE AGAINST THE FIVE TRAINED DIALECTICIANS AND THE EVIDENCE SHE GAVE OF VARIED AND PROFOUND LEARNING
6010-56788-0030 PRESENTED HERSELF AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE DOCTORATE IN PHILOSOPHY THIS WAS THE OCCASION FOR A STILL MORE BRILLIANT AND IMPOSING CEREMONY IT WAS HELD IN THE SPACIOUS HALL OF HERCULES IN THE COMMUNAL PALACE WHICH WAS MAGNIFICENTLY DECORATED FOR THE SPLENDID FUNCTION
6010-56788-0031 THE HEROINE OF THE HOUR DRESSED IN A BLACK GOWN WAS USHERED INTO THE GREAT HALL PRECEDED BY TWO COLLEGE BEADLES AND ACCOMPANIED BY TWO OF THE MOST PROMINENT LADIES
6010-56788-0032 SHE WAS GIVEN A SEAT BETWEEN THE CHANCELLOR AND THE PRIOR OF THE UNIVERSITY WHO IN TURN WERE FLANKED BY THE PROFESSORS AND OFFICIALS OF THE INSTITUTION AFTER THE USUAL PRELIMINARIES OF THE FUNCTION WERE OVER THE PRIOR OF THE UNIVERSITY DOCTOR BAZZANI
6010-56788-0033 ROSE AND PRONOUNCED AN ELOQUENT DISCOURSE IN LATIN TO WHICH LAURA MADE A SUITABLE RESPONSE IN THE SAME LANGUAGE
6010-56788-0034 BOTH SYMBOLS OF THE DOCTORATE AFTER THIS THE YOUNG DOCTOR PROCEEDED TO WHERE THE THREE CARDINALS WERE SEATED AND IN DELICATELY CHOSEN WORDS ALSO IN LATIN EXPRESSED TO THEM HER THANKS FOR THE HONOR OF THEIR PRESENCE
6010-56788-0035 LONG ESTABLISHED CUSTOM REQUIRED THAT SHE SHOULD PASS A PUBLIC EXAMINATION ON THE SUBJECT MATTER WHICH SHE WAS TO TEACH FIVE EXAMINERS WERE CHOSEN BY LOT AND ALL OF THEM PROVED TO BE MEN WHOSE NAMES SAYS FANTUZZI
6010-56788-0036 WILL ALWAYS BE HELD BY OUR UNIVERSITY IN GLORIOUS REMEMBRANCE
6010-56788-0037 NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES SHE HAD TO CONFRONT LAURA ACQUITTED HERSELF WITH EVEN GREATER CREDIT THAN ON FORMER OCCASIONS OF A SIMILAR CHARACTER THERE WAS NO QUESTION IN THE MIND OF ANY ONE PRESENT AT THE EXAMINATION
6010-56788-0038 THE FIRST PUBLIC LECTURE OF THE GIFTED YOUNG DOTTORESSA WAS MADE THE OCCASION OF A DEMONSTRATION SUCH AS THE OLD WALLS OF THE UNIVERSITY HAD RARELY WITNESSED HER LECTURE ROOM WAS THRONGED BY THE ELITE OF THE CITY
6010-56788-0039 AS WELL AS BY A LARGE CLASS OF ENTHUSIASTIC STUDENTS ALL WERE CHARMED BY HER ELOQUENCE AND AMAZED AT THE COMPLETE MASTERY SHE EVINCED OF THE SUBJECT SHE HAD SELECTED FOR DISCUSSION
6010-56788-0040 FROM THAT DAY FORTH HER REPUTATION AS A SCHOLAR AND A TEACHER WAS ESTABLISHED AND HER LECTURES WERE ATTENDED BY APPRECIATIVE STUDENTS FROM ALL PARTS OF EUROPE SHE WAS ESPECIALLY POPULAR WITH THE STUDENTS FROM GREECE GERMANY AND POLAND
6010-56788-0041 AND HER POPULARITY FAR FROM WANING WAXED GREATER WITH THE PASSING YEARS AT THE TIME OF LAURA'S ENTERING UPON HER PROFESSIONAL CAREER THE SENATE OF BOLOGNA HAD A MEDAL COINED IN HER HONOR ON THE OBVERSE OF WHICH WAS HER NAME AND EFFIGY
6010-56788-0042 WHILE ON THE REVERSE THERE WAS AN IMAGE OF MINERVA WITH THE INSCRIPTION
6010-56788-0043 FAR FROM INTERRUPTING HER STUDIES WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN THE JOY OF HER LIFE LAURA'S UNIVERSITY WORK GAVE NEW ZEST TO THE LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC PURSUITS WHICH HAD ALWAYS SUCH A FASCINATION FOR HER AMONG THE SUBJECTS THAT SPECIALLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION
6010-56788-0044 WERE STUDIES SO DIVERSE AS GREEK AND THE HIGHER MATHEMATICS SHE WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE GREAT PHYSICO MATHEMATICAL WORK OF NEWTON AND DID NOT REST UNTIL SHE HAD THOROUGHLY MASTERED THE CONTENTS OF HIS EPOCH MAKING PRINCIPIA
6010-56788-0045 ENDOWED WITH A SOUL AND A GENIUS FAR ABOVE THAT OF ORDINARY MORTALS AND AS BEING THE POSSESSOR OF A TALENT THAT INDICATED SOMETHING SUPERHUMAN
6010-56788-0046 LAURA BASSI WAS IN CONSTANT CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE MOST CELEBRATED SCHOLARS OF EUROPE AND MORE ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE WHO HAD ATTAINED EMINENCE IN HER SPECIAL LINE OF WORK AMONG THE LETTERS RECEIVED FROM HER ILLUSTRIOUS CORRESPONDENTS WERE TWO FROM VOLTAIRE
6010-56788-0047 AND WOULD AT THE SAME TIME BE A BITING SATIRE ON THE DEMIGODS OF FRENCH LITERATURE WHO HAD DARED TO EXCLUDE HIM FROM THEIR SOCIETY THAT HE MIGHT NOT MEET THE SAME REFUSAL ON THE PART OF THE ACADEMY OF BOLOGNA AS HE HAD EXPERIENCED IN PARIS
6010-56788-0048 THE FIRST LETTER WRITTEN IN ITALIAN IS SO CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WRITER THAT IT WILL BEAR REPRODUCTION MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LADY
6010-56788-0049 AND TO SALUTE THE HONOR OF HER AGE AND OF WOMEN THERE IS NOT A BASSI IN LONDON
6010-56788-0050 ALTHOUGH IT HAS PRODUCED A NEWTON IF YOUR PROTECTION SHOULD OBTAIN FOR ME THIS TITLE OF WHICH I AM SO AMBITIOUS THE GRATITUDE OF MY HEART WILL BE EQUAL TO MY ADMIRATION FOR YOURSELF
6010-56788-0051 THE SECOND LETTER OF VOLTAIRE IS IN RESPONSE TO ONE RECEIVED FROM LAURA BASSI ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAD BEEN ELECTED TO MEMBERSHIP IN THE BOLOGNA ACADEMY
6010-56788-0052 OF A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS NATURE SHE WAS AS PIOUS AS SHE WAS INTELLIGENT AND WAS THROUGHOUT HER LIFE THE DEVOTED FRIEND OF THE POOR AND THE AFFLICTED THE MOTHER OF TWELVE CHILDREN SHE NEVER PERMITTED HER SCIENTIFIC AND LITERARY WORK TO CONFLICT WITH HER DOMESTIC DUTIES
6010-56788-0053 OR TO DETRACT IN THE LEAST FROM THE SINGULAR AFFECTION WHICH SO CLOSELY UNITED HER TO HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN SHE WAS AS MUCH AT HOME WITH THE NEEDLE AND THE SPINDLE AS SHE WAS WITH HER BOOKS AND THE APPARATUS OF HER LABORATORY
6010-56788-0054 AND SHE WAS EQUALLY ADMIRABLE WHETHER SUPERINTENDING HER HOUSEHOLD LOOKING AFTER HER CHILDREN ENTERTAINING THE GREAT AND THE LEARNED OF THE WORLD OR IN HOLDING THE RAPT ATTENTION OF HER STUDENTS IN THE LECTURE ROOM
6010-56788-0055 SHE WAS INDEED A LIVING PROOF THAT HIGHER EDUCATION IS NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH WOMAN'S NATURAL AVOCATIONS AND THAT CEREBRAL DEVELOPMENT DOES NOT LEAD TO RACE SUICIDE AND ALL THE OTHER DIRE RESULTS ATTRIBUTED TO IT BY A CERTAIN CLASS OF OUR MODERN SOCIOLOGISTS AND ANTI FEMINISTS
6010-56788-0056 CONSIDERING HER MANIFOLD DUTIES AS A PROFESSOR IN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE MOTHER OF A LARGE FAMILY IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED THAT LAURA BASSI WOULD HAVE MUCH TIME FOR WRITING FOR THE PRESS SHE WAS HOWEVER ABLE TO DEVOTE SOME OF HER LEISURE MOMENTS TO THE CULTIVATION OF THE MUSES
6010-56788-0057 HER VERSES AS WELL AS HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SCIENCE OF PHYSICS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH VARIOUS PUBLICATIONS BUT THEY SUFFICE TO SHOW THAT THE ACCOUNTS OF HER TRANSMITTED TO US BY HER CONTEMPORARIES WERE NOT EXAGGERATED
6010-56788-0058 DESCRIBES HER AS HAVING A FACE THAT WAS SWEET SERIOUS AND MODEST HER EYES WERE DARK AND SPARKLING AND SHE WAS BLESSED WITH A POWERFUL MEMORY A SOLID JUDGMENT AND A READY IMAGINATION
6010-56788-0059 SHE CONVERSED FLUENTLY WITH ME IN LATIN FOR AN HOUR WITH GRACE AND PRECISION SHE IS VERY PROFICIENT IN METAPHYSICS BUT SHE PREFERS MODERN PHYSICS PARTICULARLY THAT OF NEWTON
6010-56788-0060 IT MUST NOT HOWEVER BE INFERRED FROM THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY OF LAURA BASSI OR THE ENTHUSIASTIC DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WERE SO FREQUENTLY MADE IN HER HONOR THAT SHE WAS UNIQUE IN THIS RESPECT AMONG HER COUNTRYWOMEN
6010-56788-0061 SPECIAL ATTENTION HAS BEEN CALLED TO HER AS A TYPE
6010-56788-0062 THE NAME OF LAURA BASSI LIKE THAT OF HER ILLUSTRIOUS COLLEAGUE LUIGI GALVANI IS ONE TO CONJURE WITH
6010-56788-0063 SHE IS KNOWN IN THE ANNALS OF SCIENCE AS MARY SOMERVILLE AND WAS IN EVERY WAY A WORTHY SUCCESSOR OF HER FAMOUS SISTER IN ITALY BOTH AS A WOMAN AND AS A VOTARY OF SCIENCE
6010-56788-0064 ALTHOUGH HER CHIEF TITLE TO FAME IS HER NOTABLE WORK IN MATHEMATICAL ASTRONOMY ESPECIALLY HER TRANSLATION OF LAPLACE'S MECHANIQUE CELESTE
6010-56788-0065 SHE IS LIKEWISE TO BE ACCORDED A PROMINENT PLACE AMONG SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATORS FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO PHYSICS AND COGNATE BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE CHIEF AMONG THESE ARE HER WORKS ON THE CONNECTION OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
6010-56788-0066 OCCURS THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH TO THE GREAT SUPERIORITY YOU POSSESS AND WHICH HAS SO NOBLY ILLUSTRATED YOUR NAME ON THE HIGH REGIONS OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS YOU ADD MADAM A VARIETY OF INFORMATION IN ALL PARTS OF PHYSICS AND DESCRIPTIVE NATURAL HISTORY
6010-56788-0067 AFTER THE MECHANISM OF THE HEAVENS THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONNECTION OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES
6010-56788-0068 TREATING OF PHYSICAL SUBJECTS OR OF SUBJECTS INTIMATELY RELATED TO PHYSICS ARE THE FORM AND ROTATION OF THE EARTH THE TIDES OF THE OCEAN AND ATMOSPHERE AND AN ABSTRUSE INVESTIGATION
6010-56788-0069 ON MOLECULAR AND MICROSCOPIC SCIENCE THE LAST VOLUME WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE WHEN ITS AUTHOR WAS NEAR HER NINETIETH YEAR AND BORE AS ITS MOTTO SAINT AUGUSTINE'S SUBLIME WORDS
6010-56788-0070 DEUS MAGNUS IN MAGNIS MAXIMUS IN MINIMIS GOD IS GREAT IN GREAT THINGS GREATEST IN THE LEAST AFTER MISSUS SOMERVILLE'S DEATH IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AT THE ADVANCED AGE OF NINETY TWO
6010-56788-0071 THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE STUDY AND TEACHING OF PHYSICS WAS GREATLY AUGMENTED THE BRILLIANT SUCCESS OF LAURA BASSI AND MARY SOMERVILLE HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT RESULTS
6010-56788-0072 AND THEIR NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS AS AUTHORS AND TEACHERS HAD THE EFFECT OF STIMULATING WOMEN EVERYWHERE TO EMULATE THEIR EXAMPLE AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO DEVOTE MORE ATTENTION TO A BRANCH OF SCIENCE WHICH UNTIL THEN
6010-56788-0073 BEYOND THE SPHERE AND CAPACITY OF WHAT WAS ASSUMED TO BE THE INTELLECTUALLY WEAKER SEX
6010-56788-0074 HER INVESTIGATIONS ON THE ELECTRIC ARC AND ON THE SAND RIPPLES OF THE SEASHORE WON FOR HER THE FIRST MEDAL EVER AWARDED TO A WOMAN BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY
6010-56788-0075 WHEN HOWEVER IN NINETEEN O TWO SHE WAS FORMALLY NOMINATED FOR FELLOWSHIP IN THIS SAME SOCIETY SHE FAILED OF ELECTION BECAUSE THE COUNCIL OF THE SOCIETY DISCOVERED THAT
6010-56788-0076 HOW DIFFERENT IT WAS IN THE CASE OF LAURA BASSI
6010-56788-0077 WHERE FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL WOMEN HAVE BEEN AS CORDIALLY WELCOMED TO MEMBERSHIP IN ITS LEARNED SOCIETIES AS TO THE CHAIRS OF ITS GREAT UNIVERSITIES
