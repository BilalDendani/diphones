6548-96095-0008 INSOLENTLY CALM AND SELF POSSESSED YOU CALL YOURSELF GENERAL COLLINGHAM WENT ON THE CHIEF I DO NOT CALL MYSELF I AM GENERAL SIR CHARLES COLLINGHAM OF THE BRITISH ARMY RETIRED
6548-96095-0009 NO I AM STILL ON THE ACTIVE LIST THESE POINTS WILL HAVE TO BE VERIFIED WITH ALL MY HEART YOU HAVE ALREADY SENT TO THE BRITISH EMBASSY YES BUT NO ONE HAS COME
6548-96095-0010 CONTEMPTUOUSLY IF YOU DISBELIEVE ME WHY DO YOU QUESTION ME IT IS OUR DUTY TO QUESTION YOU AND YOURS TO ANSWER IF NOT WE HAVE MEANS TO MAKE YOU YOU ARE SUSPECTED
6548-96095-0011 INCULPATED IN A TERRIBLE CRIME AND YOUR WHOLE ATTITUDE IS IS OBJECTIONABLE UNWORTHY DISGR
6548-96095-0012 I AM SURE YOU CANNOT WISH TO IMPEDE OR OBSTRUCT US WE REPRESENT THE LAW OF THIS COUNTRY
6548-96095-0013 AS HE THREW AWAY HIS HALF BURNED CIGARETTE NO NO I DO NOT IMPLY THAT IN THE LEAST I ONLY ENTREAT YOU AS A GOOD AND GALLANT GENTLEMAN TO MEET US IN A PROPER SPIRIT AND GIVE US YOUR BEST HELP
6548-96095-0014 INDEED I AM QUITE READY IF THERE HAS BEEN ANY UNPLEASANTNESS IT HAS SURELY NOT BEEN OF MY MAKING BUT RATHER OF THAT LITTLE MAN THERE
6548-96095-0015 RATHER CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND NEARLY STARTED A FRESH DISTURBANCE WELL WELL LET US SAY NO MORE OF THAT AND PROCEED TO BUSINESS I UNDERSTAND
6548-96095-0016 SAID THE JUDGE AFTER FINGERING A FEW PAGES OF THE DISPOSITIONS IN FRONT OF HIM THAT YOU ARE A FRIEND OF THE CONTESSA DI CASTAGNETO INDEED SHE HAS TOLD US SO HERSELF IT WAS VERY GOOD OF HER TO CALL ME HER FRIEND
6548-96095-0017 I AM PROUD TO HEAR SHE SO CONSIDERS ME HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN HER FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST WINTER SEASON IN ROME DID YOU FREQUENT HER HOUSE
6548-96095-0018 IF YOU MEAN WAS I PERMITTED TO CALL ON HER ON FRIENDLY TERMS YES DID YOU KNOW ALL HER FRIENDS HOW CAN I ANSWER THAT I KNOW WHOM I MET THERE FROM TIME TO TIME EXACTLY
6548-96095-0019 DID YOU OFTEN MEET AMONG THEM A SIGNOR QUADLING QUADLING QUADLING I CANNOT SAY THAT I HAVE THE NAME IS FAMILIAR SOMEHOW BUT I CANNOT RECALL THE MAN
6548-96095-0020 HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE ROMAN BANKERS CORRESE AND QUADLING AH OF COURSE ALTHOUGH I HAVE HAD NO DEALING WITH THEM CERTAINLY I HAVE NEVER MET MISTER QUADLING NOT AT THE COUNTESS'S NEVER
6548-96095-0021 OF THAT I AM QUITE SURE AND YET WE HAVE HAD POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS A CONSTANT VISITOR THERE IT IS PERFECTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME NOT ONLY HAVE I NEVER MET HIM BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD THE COUNTESS MENTION HIS NAME
6548-96095-0022 IT WILL SURPRISE YOU THEN TO BE TOLD THAT HE CALLED AT HER APARTMENT IN THE VIA MARGUTTA ON THE VERY EVENING OF HER DEPARTURE FROM ROME CALLED WAS ADMITTED WAS CLOSETED WITH HER FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR
6548-96095-0023 I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT I HAVE MORE SURPRISES FOR YOU GENERAL WHAT WILL YOU THINK WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THIS VERY QUADLING THIS FRIEND ACQUAINTANCE CALL HIM WHAT YOU PLEASE
6548-96095-0024 BUT AT LEAST INTIMATE ENOUGH TO PAY HER A VISIT ON THE EVE OF A LONG JOURNEY
6548-96095-0025 CRIED SIR CHARLES ALMOST STARTING FROM HIS CHAIR
6548-96095-0026 WHO CALLS YOU HER FRIEND BUT WE ARE OFFICIALS FIRST AND SENTIMENT CANNOT BE PERMITTED TO INFLUENCE US WE HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR SUSPECTING THAT LADY I TELL YOU THAT FRANKLY
6548-96095-0027 BECAUSE SHE WAS IN THE CAR THE ONLY WOMAN YOU UNDERSTAND BETWEEN LAROCHE AND PARIS DO YOU SUSPECT A FEMALE HAND THEN ASKED THE GENERAL EVIDENTLY MUCH INTERESTED AND IMPRESSED
6548-96095-0028 THAT IS SO ALTHOUGH I AM EXCEEDING MY DUTY IN REVEALING THIS
6548-96095-0029 OF THE HIGHEST CHARACTER BELIEVE ME I KNOW THAT TO BE THE CASE WHOM YOU YET SUSPECT OF AN ATROCIOUS CRIME WAS THE ONLY FEMALE IN THE CAR OBVIOUSLY WHO ELSE WHAT OTHER WOMAN COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN IN THE CAR
6548-96095-0030 NO ONE GOT IN AT LAROCHE THE TRAIN NEVER STOPPED TILL IT REACHED PARIS ON THAT LAST POINT AT LEAST YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I ASSURE YOU WHY NOT UPON THE OTHER ALSO THE TRAIN STOPPED
6548-96095-0031 INTERJECTED THE DETECTIVE WHY HAS NO ONE TOLD US THAT POSSIBLY BECAUSE YOU NEVER ASKED BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS THE FACT VERIFY IT EVERY ONE WILL TELL YOU THE SAME THE DETECTIVE HIMSELF HURRIED TO THE DOOR AND CALLED IN THE PORTER
6548-96095-0032 HE WAS WITHIN HIS RIGHTS OF COURSE BUT THE ACTION SHOWED DISTRUST AT WHICH THE GENERAL ONLY SMILED BUT HE LAUGHED OUTRIGHT WHEN THE STILL STUPID AND HALF DAZED PORTER OF COURSE CORROBORATED THE STATEMENT AT ONCE
6548-96095-0033 AT WHOSE INSTANCE WAS THE TRAIN PULLED UP ASKED THE DETECTIVE AND THE JUDGE NODDED HIS HEAD APPROVINGLY TO KNOW THAT WOULD FIX FRESH SUSPICION BUT THE PORTER COULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION
6548-96095-0034 SOME ONE HAD RUNG THE ALARM BELL SO AT LEAST THE CONDUCTOR HAD DECLARED OTHERWISE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED YET HE THE PORTER
6548-96095-0035 BUT THERE HAD BEEN A HALT YES ASSUREDLY THIS IS A NEW LIGHT THE JUDGE CONFESSED DO YOU DRAW ANY CONCLUSION FROM IT HE WENT ON TO ASK THE GENERAL THAT IS SURELY YOUR BUSINESS I HAVE ONLY ELICITED THE FACT TO DISPROVE YOUR THEORY
6548-96095-0036 BUT IF YOU WISH I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT STRIKES ME THE JUDGE BOWED ASSENT THE BARE FACT THAT THE TRAIN WAS HALTED WOULD MEAN LITTLE THAT WOULD BE THE NATURAL ACT OF A TIMID OR EXCITABLE PERSON INVOLVED INDIRECTLY IN SUCH A CATASTROPHE
6548-96095-0037 THE FAIR INFERENCE IS THAT THERE WAS SOME REASON AN UNAVOWABLE REASON FOR HALTING THE TRAIN AND THAT REASON WOULD BE YOU MUST SEE IT WITHOUT MY ASSISTANCE SURELY WHY
6548-96095-0038 BUT HOW COULD THAT BE YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT PERSON SOME OF YOU ESPECIALLY AT SUCH A CRITICAL TIME THE AISLE WOULD BE FULL OF PEOPLE BOTH EXITS WERE THUS PRACTICALLY OVERLOOKED
6548-96095-0039 MY IDEA IS IT IS ONLY AN IDEA UNDERSTAND THAT THE PERSON HAD ALREADY LEFT THE CAR THAT IS TO SAY THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR ESCAPED HOW WHERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN
6548-96095-0040 ESCAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE COMPARTMENT WHERE YOU FOUND THE MURDERED MAN YOU NOTICED THE OPEN WINDOW THEN QUICKLY ASKED THE DETECTIVE WHEN WAS THAT DIRECTLY I ENTERED THE COMPARTMENT AT THE FIRST ALARM
6548-96095-0041 IT OCCURRED TO ME AT ONCE THAT SOME ONE MIGHT HAVE GONE THROUGH IT BUT NO WOMAN COULD HAVE DONE IT
6548-96095-0042 GOING AT TOP SPEED WOULD BE AN IMPOSSIBLE FEAT FOR A WOMAN
6548-96095-0043 WHY SHOULD IT BE A WOMAN MORE THAN A MAN BECAUSE
6548-96095-0044 THE LITTLE DETECTIVE WAS MUCH CONCERNED AT THE UTTER WANT OF RETICENCE DISPLAYED BY HIS COLLEAGUE BECAUSE
6548-96095-0045 BECAUSE THIS WAS FOUND IN THE COMPARTMENT AND HE HELD OUT THE PIECE OF LACE AND THE SCRAP OF BEADING FOR THE GENERAL'S INSPECTION ADDING QUICKLY YOU HAVE SEEN THESE OR ONE OF THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THEM BEFORE
6548-96095-0046 I AM SURE OF IT I CALL UPON YOU I DEMAND NO I APPEAL TO YOUR SENSE OF HONOUR SIR COLLINGHAM
