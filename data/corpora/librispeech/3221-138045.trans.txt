3221-138045-0000 FOR IN MY COUNTRY SKIRTS OR TAILS TAILS OR SKIRTS IT'S ALL ONE HUSH FRIEND SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE SINCE THIS LADY DUENNA COMES IN QUEST OF ME FROM SUCH A DISTANT LAND SHE CANNOT BE ONE OF THOSE THE APOTHECARY MEANT MOREOVER
3221-138045-0001 IT IS IN THE SERVICE OF QUEENS AND EMPRESSES FOR IN THEIR OWN HOUSES THEY ARE MISTRESSES PARAMOUNT AND HAVE OTHER DUENNAS TO WAIT ON THEM TO THIS DONA RODRIGUEZ WHO WAS PRESENT MADE ANSWER MY LADY
3221-138045-0002 BUT LAWS GO AS KINGS LIKE LET NOBODY SPEAK ILL OF DUENNAS ABOVE ALL OF ANCIENT MAIDEN ONES FOR THOUGH I AM NOT ONE MYSELF I KNOW AND AM AWARE OF THE ADVANTAGE A MAIDEN DUENNA HAS OVER ONE THAT IS A WIDOW
3221-138045-0003 BUT HE WHO CLIPPED US HAS KEPT THE SCISSORS FOR ALL THAT SAID SANCHO THERE'S SO MUCH TO BE CLIPPED ABOUT DUENNAS SO MY BARBER SAID THAT IT WILL BE BETTER NOT TO STIR THE RICE EVEN THOUGH IT STICKS THESE SQUIRES RETURNED DONA RODRIGUEZ
3221-138045-0004 AND AS THEY ARE THE HAUNTING SPIRITS OF THE ANTECHAMBERS AND WATCH US AT EVERY STEP WHENEVER THEY ARE NOT SAYING THEIR PRAYERS AND THAT'S OFTEN ENOUGH THEY SPEND THEIR TIME IN TATTLING ABOUT US DIGGING UP OUR BONES AND BURYING OUR GOOD NAME BUT I CAN TELL THESE WALKING BLOCKS
3221-138045-0005 THAT WE WILL LIVE IN SPITE OF THEM AND IN GREAT HOUSES TOO THOUGH WE DIE OF HUNGER AND COVER OUR FLESH BE IT DELICATE OR NOT WITH WIDOW'S WEEDS
3221-138045-0006 AND ROOT OUT THE PREJUDICE IN THE GREAT SANCHO PANZA'S MIND TO WHICH SANCHO REPLIED EVER SINCE I HAVE SNIFFED THE GOVERNORSHIP I HAVE GOT RID OF THE HUMOURS OF A SQUIRE AND I DON'T CARE A WILD FIG FOR ALL THE DUENNAS IN THE WORLD
3221-138045-0007 THEY WOULD HAVE CARRIED ON THIS DUENNA DISPUTE FURTHER HAD THEY NOT HEARD THE NOTES OF THE FIFE AND DRUMS ONCE MORE FROM WHICH THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE DISTRESSED DUENNA WAS MAKING HER ENTRANCE THE DUCHESS ASKED THE DUKE IF IT WOULD BE PROPER TO GO OUT TO RECEIVE HER
3221-138045-0008 AS SHE WAS A COUNTESS AND A PERSON OF RANK IN RESPECT OF HER BEING A COUNTESS SAID SANCHO BEFORE THE DUKE COULD REPLY I AM FOR YOUR HIGHNESSES GOING OUT TO RECEIVE HER
3221-138045-0009 IT IS MY OPINION YOU SHOULD NOT STIR A STEP WHO BADE THEE MEDDLE IN THIS SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE WHO SENOR SAID SANCHO I MEDDLE FOR I HAVE A RIGHT TO MEDDLE AS A SQUIRE WHO HAS LEARNED THE RULES OF COURTESY IN THE SCHOOL OF YOUR WORSHIP
3221-138045-0010 AND NOW THE DRUMS AND FIFE MADE THEIR ENTRANCE AS BEFORE AND HERE THE AUTHOR BROUGHT THIS SHORT CHAPTER TO AN END AND BEGAN THE NEXT FOLLOWING UP THE SAME ADVENTURE WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE IN THE HISTORY CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT
3221-138045-0011 WHEREIN IS TOLD THE DISTRESSED DUENNA'S TALE OF HER MISFORTUNES FOLLOWING THE MELANCHOLY MUSICIANS THERE FILED INTO THE GARDEN AS MANY AS TWELVE DUENNAS IN TWO LINES ALL DRESSED IN AMPLE MOURNING ROBES APPARENTLY OF MILLED SERGE
3221-138045-0012 WITH HOODS OF FINE WHITE GAUZE SO LONG THAT THEY ALLOWED ONLY THE BORDER OF THE ROBE TO BE SEEN BEHIND THEM CAME THE COUNTESS TRIFALDI THE SQUIRE TRIFALDIN OF THE WHITE BEARD LEADING HER BY THE HAND CLAD IN THE FINEST UNNAPPED BLACK BAIZE SUCH THAT
3221-138045-0013 HAD IT A NAP EVERY TUFT WOULD HAVE SHOWN AS BIG AS A MARTOS CHICKPEA THE TAIL OR SKIRT OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE CALLED ENDED IN THREE POINTS
3221-138045-0014 SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED THE COUNTESS ZORRUNA AS IT WAS THE CUSTOM IN THOSE PARTS FOR LORDS TO TAKE DISTINCTIVE TITLES FROM THE THING OR THINGS MOST ABUNDANT IN THEIR DOMINIONS THIS COUNTESS HOWEVER IN HONOUR OF THE NEW FASHION OF HER SKIRT
3221-138045-0015 AND TOOK UP TRIFALDI THE TWELVE DUENNAS AND THE LADY CAME ON AT PROCESSION PACE THEIR FACES BEING COVERED WITH BLACK VEILS NOT TRANSPARENT ONES LIKE TRIFALDIN'S BUT SO CLOSE THAT THEY ALLOWED NOTHING TO BE SEEN THROUGH THEM AS SOON AS THE BAND OF DUENNAS WAS FULLY IN SIGHT
3221-138045-0016 THE DUKE THE DUCHESS AND DON QUIXOTE STOOD UP AS WELL AS ALL WHO WERE WATCHING THE SLOW MOVING PROCESSION THE TWELVE DUENNAS HALTED AND FORMED A LANE ALONG WHICH THE DISTRESSED ONE ADVANCED TRIFALDIN STILL HOLDING HER HAND
3221-138045-0017 I SHOULD SAY TO THIS YOUR HANDMAID FOR I AM IN SUCH DISTRESS THAT I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE A PROPER RETURN BECAUSE MY STRANGE AND UNPARALLELED MISFORTUNE HAS CARRIED OFF MY WITS AND I KNOW NOT WHITHER
3221-138045-0018 BUT IT MUST BE A LONG WAY OFF FOR THE MORE I LOOK FOR THEM THE LESS I FIND THEM HE WOULD BE WANTING IN WITS SENORA COUNTESS SAID THE DUKE
3221-138045-0019 WHO DID NOT PERCEIVE YOUR WORTH BY YOUR PERSON FOR AT A GLANCE IT MAY BE SEEN IT DESERVES ALL THE CREAM OF COURTESY AND FLOWER OF POLITE USAGE AND RAISING HER UP BY THE HAND HE LED HER TO A SEAT BESIDE THE DUCHESS
3221-138045-0020 BUT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF IT UNTIL THEY THEMSELVES DISPLAYED THEM OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND FREE WILL
3221-138045-0021 THAT MY MOST MISERABLE MISERY WILL BE ACCORDED A RECEPTION NO LESS DISPASSIONATE THAN GENEROUS AND CONDOLENT IN YOUR MOST VALIANT BOSOMS FOR IT IS ONE THAT IS ENOUGH TO MELT MARBLE SOFTEN DIAMONDS AND MOLLIFY THE STEEL OF THE MOST HARDENED HEARTS IN THE WORLD
3221-138045-0022 BUT ERE IT IS PROCLAIMED TO YOUR HEARING NOT TO SAY YOUR EARS I WOULD FAIN BE ENLIGHTENED WHETHER THERE BE PRESENT IN THIS SOCIETY CIRCLE OR COMPANY THAT KNIGHT IMMACULATISSIMUS DON QUIXOTE DE LA MANCHISSIMA AND HIS SQUIRISSIMUS PANZA
3221-138045-0023 THE PANZA IS HERE SAID SANCHO BEFORE ANYONE COULD REPLY AND DON QUIXOTISSIMUS TOO AND SO MOST DISTRESSEDEST DUENISSIMA YOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU WILLISSIMUS
3221-138045-0024 ON HEARING THIS THE DISTRESSED DUENNA MADE AS THOUGH SHE WOULD THROW HERSELF AT DON QUIXOTE'S FEET AND ACTUALLY DID FALL BEFORE THEM AND SAID AS SHE STROVE TO EMBRACE THEM BEFORE THESE FEET AND LEGS I CAST MYSELF O UNCONQUERED KNIGHT
3221-138045-0025 TO THIS SANCHO MADE ANSWER AS TO MY GOODNESS SENORA BEING AS LONG AND AS GREAT AS YOUR SQUIRE'S BEARD IT MATTERS VERY LITTLE TO ME MAY I HAVE MY SOUL WELL BEARDED AND MOUSTACHED WHEN IT COMES TO QUIT THIS LIFE THAT'S THE POINT
3221-138045-0026 AND BETWEEN THEMSELVES THEY COMMENDED THE CLEVER ACTING OF THE TRIFALDI WHO RETURNING TO HER SEAT SAID
3221-138045-0027 AND DIRECTION I BEING THE OLDEST AND HIGHEST IN RANK OF HER MOTHER'S DUENNAS TIME PASSED AND THE YOUNG ANTONOMASIA REACHED THE AGE OF FOURTEEN AND SUCH A PERFECTION OF BEAUTY THAT NATURE COULD NOT RAISE IT HIGHER THEN
3221-138045-0028 IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED HER INTELLIGENCE WAS CHILDISH SHE WAS AS INTELLIGENT AS SHE WAS FAIR AND SHE WAS FAIRER THAN ALL THE WORLD AND IS SO STILL
3221-138045-0029 UNLESS THE ENVIOUS FATES AND HARD HEARTED SISTERS THREE HAVE CUT FOR HER THE THREAD OF LIFE BUT THAT THEY HAVE NOT FOR HEAVEN WILL NOT SUFFER SO GREAT A WRONG TO EARTH AS IT WOULD BE TO PLUCK UNRIPE THE GRAPES OF THE FAIREST VINEYARD ON ITS SURFACE
3221-138045-0030 GALLANT BEARING HIS NUMEROUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND GRACES AND HIS QUICKNESS AND READINESS OF WIT
3221-138045-0031 THAT HE PLAYED THE GUITAR SO AS TO MAKE IT SPEAK AND HE WAS BESIDES A POET AND A GREAT DANCER AND HE COULD MAKE BIRDCAGES SO WELL THAT BY MAKING THEM ALONE HE MIGHT HAVE GAINED A LIVELIHOOD HAD HE FOUND HIMSELF REDUCED TO UTTER POVERTY
3221-138045-0032 AND GIFTS AND GRACES OF THIS KIND ARE ENOUGH TO BRING DOWN A MOUNTAIN NOT TO SAY A TENDER YOUNG GIRL
3221-138045-0033 SOME VERSES I HEARD HIM SINGING ONE NIGHT FROM A GRATING THAT OPENED ON THE STREET WHERE HE LIVED
3221-138045-0034 ANOTHER TIME HE SANG COME DEATH SO SUBTLY VEILED THAT I THY COMING KNOW NOT HOW OR WHEN LEST IT SHOULD GIVE ME LIFE AGAIN TO FIND HOW SWEET IT IS TO DIE AND OTHER VERSES AND BURDENS OF THE SAME SORT SUCH AS
3221-138045-0035 AND THEN WHEN THEY CONDESCEND TO COMPOSE A SORT OF VERSE THAT WAS AT THAT TIME IN VOGUE IN KANDY WHICH THEY CALL SEGUIDILLAS
3221-138045-0036 THOUGH IT IS NOT THEY THAT ARE IN FAULT BUT THE SIMPLETONS THAT EXTOL THEM AND THE FOOLS THAT BELIEVE IN THEM AND HAD I BEEN THE FAITHFUL DUENNA I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS STALE CONCEITS WOULD HAVE NEVER MOVED ME
3221-138045-0037 NOR SHOULD I HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN BY SUCH PHRASES AS IN DEATH I LIVE IN ICE I BURN IN FLAMES I SHIVER
3221-138045-0038 PARADOXES OF THAT SORT WHICH THEIR WRITINGS ARE FULL OF
3221-138045-0039 AGAIN WOE IS ME HAPLESS THAT I AM IT WAS NOT VERSES THAT CONQUERED ME BUT MY OWN SIMPLICITY IT WAS NOT MUSIC MADE ME YIELD BUT MY OWN IMPRUDENCE
3221-138045-0040 DECEIVED NOT BY HIM BUT BY ME UNDER THE TITLE OF A LAWFUL HUSBAND FOR SINNER THOUGH I WAS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO APPROACH THE EDGE OF HER SHOE SOLE WITHOUT BEING HER HUSBAND NO NO NOT THAT
3221-138045-0041 DON CLAVIJO BEING A
3221-138045-0042 THE ENTANGLEMENT REMAINED FOR SOME TIME A SECRET KEPT HIDDEN BY MY CUNNING PRECAUTIONS UNTIL I PERCEIVED THAT A CERTAIN EXPANSION OF WAIST IN ANTONOMASIA MUST BEFORE LONG DISCLOSE IT THE DREAD OF WHICH MADE US ALL THERE TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER AND IT WAS AGREED
3221-138045-0043 IN VIRTUE OF AN AGREEMENT TO MARRY HIM MADE BY THE PRINCESS AND DRAFTED BY MY WIT IN SUCH BINDING TERMS THAT THE MIGHT OF SAMSON COULD NOT HAVE BROKEN IT THE NECESSARY STEPS WERE TAKEN THE VICAR SAW THE AGREEMENT AND TOOK THE LADY'S CONFESSION
3221-138045-0044 CHAPTER THIRTY NINE IN WHICH THE TRIFALDI CONTINUES HER MARVELLOUS AND MEMORABLE STORY BY EVERY WORD THAT SANCHO UTTERED THE DUCHESS WAS AS MUCH DELIGHTED AS DON QUIXOTE WAS DRIVEN TO DESPERATION
3221-138045-0045 HE BADE HIM HOLD HIS TONGUE AND THE DISTRESSED ONE WENT ON TO SAY AT LENGTH AFTER MUCH QUESTIONING AND ANSWERING AS THE PRINCESS HELD TO HER STORY WITHOUT CHANGING OR VARYING HER PREVIOUS DECLARATION
3221-138045-0046 THE VICAR GAVE HIS DECISION IN FAVOUR OF DON CLAVIJO AND SHE WAS DELIVERED OVER TO HIM AS HIS LAWFUL WIFE
3221-138045-0047 SO TOOK TO HEART THAT WITHIN THE SPACE OF THREE DAYS WE BURIED HER SHE DIED NO DOUBT SAID SANCHO OF COURSE SAID TRIFALDIN THEY DON'T BURY LIVING PEOPLE IN KANDY ONLY THE DEAD
3221-138045-0048 SENOR SQUIRE SAID SANCHO A MAN IN A SWOON HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE BURIED BEFORE NOW IN THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS DEAD
3221-138045-0049 TO HAVE SWOONED RATHER THAN DIED
3221-138045-0050 BUT TO MARRY SUCH AN ELEGANT ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN AS HAS BEEN JUST NOW DESCRIBED TO US INDEED INDEED THOUGH IT WAS A FOLLY IT WAS NOT SUCH A GREAT ONE AS YOU THINK FOR ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MY MASTER HERE AND
3221-138045-0051 AS OF MEN OF LETTERS BISHOPS ARE MADE
3221-138045-0052 THOU ART RIGHT SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR WITH A KNIGHT ERRANT IF HE HAS BUT TWO FINGERS BREADTH OF GOOD FORTUNE
3221-138045-0053 BUT LET SENORA THE DISTRESSED ONE PROCEED FOR I SUSPECT SHE HAS GOT YET TO TELL US THE BITTER PART OF THIS SO FAR SWEET STORY THE BITTER IS INDEED TO COME SAID THE COUNTESS
3221-138045-0054 OVER THE QUEEN'S GRAVE THERE APPEARED MOUNTED UPON A WOODEN HORSE THE GIANT MALAMBRUNO
3221-138045-0055 AND HE TO REVENGE THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN PUNISH THE AUDACITY OF DON CLAVIJO
3221-138045-0056 LEFT THEM BOTH ENCHANTED BY HIS ART ON THE GRAVE ITSELF SHE BEING CHANGED INTO AN APE OF BRASS AND HE
3221-138045-0057 INTO A HORRIBLE CROCODILE OF SOME UNKNOWN METAL WHILE BETWEEN THE TWO THERE STANDS A PILLAR ALSO OF METAL WITH CERTAIN CHARACTERS IN THE SYRIAC LANGUAGE INSCRIBED UPON IT WHICH BEING TRANSLATED INTO KANDIAN AND NOW INTO CASTILIAN
3221-138045-0058 NEVERTHELESS I SUMMONED UP MY STRENGTH AS WELL AS I COULD AND IN A TREMBLING AND PITEOUS VOICE I ADDRESSED SUCH WORDS TO HIM AS INDUCED HIM TO STAY THE INFLICTION OF A PUNISHMENT SO SEVERE HE THEN CAUSED ALL THE DUENNAS OF THE PALACE THOSE THAT ARE HERE PRESENT
3221-138045-0059 TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND AFTER HAVING DWELT UPON THE ENORMITY OF OUR OFFENCE AND DENOUNCED DUENNAS THEIR CHARACTERS THEIR EVIL WAYS AND WORSE INTRIGUES LAYING TO THE CHARGE OF ALL WHAT I ALONE WAS GUILTY OF
3221-138045-0060 HE SAID HE WOULD NOT VISIT US WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT WITH OTHERS OF A SLOW NATURE WHICH WOULD BE IN EFFECT CIVIL DEATH FOR EVER AND THE VERY INSTANT HE CEASED SPEAKING
3221-138045-0061 WE ALL FELT THE PORES OF OUR FACES OPENING AND PRICKING US AS IF WITH THE POINTS OF NEEDLES WE AT ONCE PUT OUR HANDS UP TO OUR FACES AND FOUND OURSELVES IN THE STATE YOU NOW SEE
3221-138045-0062 AND DISCLOSED COUNTENANCES ALL BRISTLING WITH BEARDS SOME RED SOME BLACK SOME WHITE AND SOME GRIZZLED AT WHICH SPECTACLE THE DUKE AND DUCHESS MADE A SHOW OF BEING FILLED WITH WONDER DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO WERE OVERWHELMED WITH AMAZEMENT AND THE BYSTANDERS
3221-138045-0063 WITH HIS ENORMOUS SCIMITAR INSTEAD OF OBSCURING THE LIGHT OF OUR COUNTENANCES WITH THESE WOOL COMBINGS THAT COVER US FOR IF WE LOOK INTO THE MATTER SIRS AND WHAT I AM NOW GOING TO SAY I WOULD SAY WITH EYES FLOWING LIKE FOUNTAINS
3221-138045-0064 KEEP THEM AS DRY AS BARLEY SPEARS AND SO I SAY IT WITHOUT TEARS
