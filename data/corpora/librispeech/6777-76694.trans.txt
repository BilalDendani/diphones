6777-76694-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE CITY OF THE ABSENT WHEN I THINK I DESERVE PARTICULARLY WELL OF MYSELF AND HAVE EARNED THE RIGHT TO ENJOY A LITTLE TREAT I STROLL FROM COVENT GARDEN INTO THE CITY OF LONDON
6777-76694-0001 AFTER BUSINESS HOURS THERE ON A SATURDAY OR BETTER YET ON A SUNDAY AND ROAM ABOUT ITS DESERTED NOOKS AND CORNERS IT IS NECESSARY TO THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF THESE JOURNEYS THAT THEY SHOULD BE MADE IN SUMMER TIME
6777-76694-0002 FOR THEN THE RETIRED SPOTS THAT I LOVE TO HAUNT ARE AT THEIR IDLEST AND DULLEST A GENTLE FALL OF RAIN IS NOT OBJECTIONABLE AND A WARM MIST SETS OFF MY FAVOURITE RETREATS TO DECIDED ADVANTAGE
6777-76694-0003 AMONG THESE CITY CHURCHYARDS HOLD A HIGH PLACE SUCH STRANGE CHURCHYARDS HIDE IN THE CITY OF LONDON CHURCHYARDS SOMETIMES SO ENTIRELY DETACHED FROM CHURCHES ALWAYS SO PRESSED UPON
6777-76694-0004 BY HOUSES SO SMALL SO RANK SO SILENT SO FORGOTTEN EXCEPT BY THE FEW PEOPLE WHO EVER LOOK DOWN INTO THEM FROM THEIR SMOKY WINDOWS AS I STAND
6777-76694-0005 PEEPING IN THROUGH THE IRON GATES AND RAILS I CAN PEEL THE RUSTY METAL OFF LIKE BARK FROM AN OLD TREE THE ILLEGIBLE TOMBSTONES ARE ALL LOP SIDED THE GRAVE MOUNDS LOST THEIR SHAPE IN THE RAINS
6777-76694-0006 OF A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE LOMBARDY POPLAR OR PLANE TREE THAT WAS ONCE A DRYSALTER'S DAUGHTER AND SEVERAL COMMON COUNCILMEN HAS WITHERED LIKE THOSE WORTHIES AND ITS DEPARTED LEAVES ARE DUST BENEATH IT
6777-76694-0007 CONTAGION OF SLOW RUIN OVERHANGS THE PLACE THE DISCOLOURED TILED ROOFS OF THE ENVIRONING BUILDINGS STAND SO AWRY THAT THEY CAN HARDLY BE PROOF AGAINST ANY STRESS OF WEATHER
6777-76694-0008 OLD CRAZY STACKS OF CHIMNEYS SEEM TO LOOK DOWN AS THEY OVERHANG DUBIOUSLY CALCULATING HOW FAR THEY WILL HAVE TO FALL IN AN ANGLE OF THE WALLS WHAT WAS ONCE THE TOOL HOUSE OF THE GRAVE DIGGER ROTS AWAY
6777-76694-0009 ENCRUSTED WITH TOADSTOOLS PIPES AND SPOUTS FOR CARRYING OFF THE RAIN FROM THE ENCOMPASSING GABLES BROKEN OR FELONIOUSLY CUT FOR OLD LEAD LONG AGO NOW LET THE RAIN DRIP AND SPLASH AS IT LIST
6777-76694-0010 UPON THE WEEDY EARTH SOMETIMES THERE IS A RUSTY PUMP SOMEWHERE NEAR AND AS I LOOK IN AT THE RAILS AND MEDITATE I HEAR IT WORKING UNDER AN UNKNOWN HAND WITH A CREAKING PROTEST
6777-76694-0011 AS THOUGH THE DEPARTED IN THE CHURCHYARD URGED LET US LIE HERE IN PEACE DON'T SUCK US UP AND DRINK US ONE OF MY BEST BELOVED CHURCHYARDS I CALL THE CHURCHYARD OF SAINT GHASTLY GRIM
6777-76694-0012 TOUCHING WHAT MEN IN GENERAL CALL IT I HAVE NO INFORMATION IT LIES AT THE HEART OF THE CITY AND THE BLACKWALL RAILWAY SHRIEKS AT IT DAILY IT IS A SMALL SMALL CHURCHYARD WITH A FEROCIOUS
6777-76694-0013 STRONG SPIKED IRON GATE LIKE A JAIL THIS GATE IS ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS AND CROSS BONES
6777-76694-0014 WROUGHT IN STONE BUT IT LIKEWISE CAME INTO THE MIND OF SAINT GHASTLY GRIM THAT TO STICK IRON SPIKES A TOP OF THE STONE SKULLS AS THOUGH THEY WERE IMPALED WOULD BE A PLEASANT DEVICE
6777-76694-0015 THEREFORE THE SKULLS GRIN ALOFT HORRIBLY THRUST THROUGH AND THROUGH WITH IRON SPEARS HENCE THERE IS ATTRACTION OF REPULSION FOR ME IN SAINT GHASTLY GRIM AND HAVING OFTEN CONTEMPLATED IT
6777-76694-0016 IN THE DAYLIGHT AND THE DARK I ONCE FELT DRAWN TOWARDS IT IN A THUNDERSTORM AT MIDNIGHT WHY NOT I SAID IN SELF EXCUSE I HAVE BEEN TO SEE THE COLOSSEUM BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
6777-76694-0017 IS IT WORSE TO GO TO SEE SAINT GHASTLY GRIM BY THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHTNING I REPAIRED TO THE SAINT IN A HACKNEY CAB AND FOUND THE SKULLS MOST EFFECTIVE HAVING THE AIR OF A PUBLIC EXECUTION AND
6777-76694-0018 SEEMING AS THE LIGHTNING FLASHED TO WINK AND GRIN WITH THE PAIN OF THE SPIKES HAVING NO OTHER PERSON TO WHOM TO IMPART MY SATISFACTION I COMMUNICATED IT TO THE DRIVER SO FAR FROM BEING RESPONSIVE
6777-76694-0019 HE SURVEYED ME HE WAS NATURALLY A BOTTLED NOSED RED FACED MAN WITH A BLANCHED COUNTENANCE AND AS HE DROVE ME BACK HE EVER AND AGAIN GLANCED IN OVER HIS SHOULDER THROUGH THE LITTLE FRONT WINDOW OF HIS CARRIAGE
6777-76694-0020 AS MISTRUSTING THAT I WAS A FARE ORIGINALLY FROM A GRAVE IN THE CHURCHYARD OF SAINT GHASTLY GRIM WHO MIGHT HAVE FLITTED HOME AGAIN WITHOUT PAYING SOMETIMES THE QUEER HALL OF SOME QUEER COMPANY
6777-76694-0021 GIVES UPON A CHURCHYARD SUCH AS THIS AND
6777-76694-0022 YOU MAY HEAR THEM IF YOU ARE LOOKING IN THROUGH THE IRON RAILS WHICH YOU NEVER ARE WHEN I AM TOASTING THEIR OWN WORSHIPFUL PROSPERITY SOMETIMES A WHOLESALE HOUSE OF BUSINESS
6777-76694-0023 REQUIRING MUCH ROOM FOR STOWAGE
6777-76694-0024 WILL LUMBER UP THE WINDOWS AS IF THEY WERE HOLDING SOME CROWDED TRADE MEETING OF THEMSELVES WITHIN SOMETIMES THE COMMANDING WINDOWS ARE ALL BLANK AND SHOW NO MORE SIGN OF LIFE THAN THE GRAVES BELOW NOT SO MUCH
6777-76694-0025 FOR THEY TELL OF WHAT ONCE UPON A TIME WAS LIFE UNDOUBTEDLY SUCH WAS THE SURROUNDING OF ONE CITY CHURCHYARD THAT I SAW LAST SUMMER ON A VOLUNTEERING SATURDAY EVENING TOWARDS EIGHT OF THE CLOCK
6777-76694-0026 WHEN WITH ASTONISHMENT I BEHELD AN OLD OLD MAN AND AN OLD OLD WOMAN IN IT MAKING HAY YES OF ALL OCCUPATIONS IN THIS WORLD MAKING HAY IT WAS A VERY CONFINED PATCH OF CHURCHYARD
6777-76694-0027 LYING BETWEEN GRACECHURCH STREET AND THE TOWER CAPABLE OF YIELDING SAY AN APRONFUL OF HAY BY WHAT MEANS THE OLD OLD MAN AND WOMAN HAD GOT INTO IT WITH AN ALMOST TOOTHLESS HAY MAKING RAKE
6777-76694-0028 I COULD NOT FATHOM NO OPEN WINDOW WAS WITHIN VIEW NO WINDOW AT ALL WAS WITHIN VIEW SUFFICIENTLY NEAR THE GROUND TO HAVE ENABLED THEIR OLD LEGS TO DESCEND FROM IT THE RUSTY CHURCHYARD GATE WAS LOCKED
6777-76694-0029 GRAVELY AMONG THE GRAVES THEY MADE HAY ALL ALONE BY THEMSELVES THEY LOOKED LIKE TIME AND HIS WIFE THERE WAS BUT THE ONE RAKE BETWEEN THEM AND THEY BOTH HAD HOLD OF IT
6777-76694-0030 IN A PASTORALLY LOVING MANNER AND THERE WAS HAY ON THE OLD WOMAN'S BLACK BONNET AS IF THE OLD MAN HAD RECENTLY BEEN PLAYFUL THE OLD MAN WAS QUITE AN OBSOLETE OLD MAN IN KNEE BREECHES AND COARSE GREY STOCKINGS
6777-76694-0031 AND THE OLD WOMAN WORE MITTENS
6777-76694-0032 THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME AS I LOOKED ON UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM THE OLD WOMAN WAS MUCH TOO BRIGHT FOR A PEW OPENER THE OLD MAN MUCH TOO MEEK FOR A BEADLE
6777-76694-0033 ON AN OLD TOMBSTONE IN THE FOREGROUND BETWEEN ME AND THEM WERE TWO CHERUBIM BUT FOR THOSE CELESTIAL EMBELLISHMENTS BEING REPRESENTED AS HAVING NO POSSIBLE USE FOR KNEE BREECHES STOCKINGS OR MITTENS
6777-76694-0034 I SHOULD HAVE COMPARED THEM WITH THE HAY MAKERS AND SOUGHT A LIKENESS I COUGHED
6777-76694-0035 THEY USED THE RAKE WITH A MEASURED ACTION DRAWING THE SCANTY CROP TOWARDS THEM AND SO I WAS FAIN TO LEAVE THEM UNDER THREE YARDS AND A HALF OF DARKENING SKY GRAVELY MAKING HAY AMONG THE GRAVES ALL ALONE
6777-76694-0036 BY THEMSELVES PERHAPS THEY WERE SPECTRES AND I WANTED A MEDIUM IN ANOTHER CITY CHURCHYARD OF SIMILAR CRAMPED DIMENSIONS I SAW THAT SELFSAME SUMMER TWO COMFORTABLE CHARITY CHILDREN THEY WERE MAKING LOVE
6777-76694-0037 TREMENDOUS PROOF OF THE VIGOUR OF THAT IMMORTAL ARTICLE FOR THEY WERE IN THE GRACEFUL UNIFORM UNDER WHICH ENGLISH CHARITY DELIGHTS TO HIDE HERSELF AND THEY WERE OVERGROWN AND THEIR LEGS HIS LEGS AT LEAST
6777-76694-0038 FOR I AM MODESTLY INCOMPETENT TO SPEAK OF HERS WERE AS MUCH IN THE WRONG AS MERE PASSIVE WEAKNESS OF CHARACTER CAN RENDER LEGS O IT WAS A LEADEN CHURCHYARD BUT NO DOUBT A GOLDEN GROUND TO THOSE YOUNG PERSONS
6777-76694-0039 I FIRST SAW THEM ON A SATURDAY EVENING AND PERCEIVING FROM THEIR OCCUPATION THAT SATURDAY EVENING WAS THEIR TRYSTING TIME I RETURNED THAT EVENING SE'NNIGHT AND RENEWED THE CONTEMPLATION OF THEM
6777-76694-0040 THEY CAME THERE TO SHAKE THE BITS OF MATTING WHICH WERE SPREAD IN THE CHURCH AISLES AND THEY AFTERWARDS ROLLED THEM UP HE ROLLING HIS END SHE ROLLING HERS UNTIL THEY MET AND OVER THE TWO ONCE DIVIDED
6777-76694-0041 NOW UNITED ROLLS SWEET EMBLEM GAVE AND RECEIVED A CHASTE SALUTE IT WAS SO REFRESHING TO FIND ONE OF MY FADED CHURCHYARDS BLOOMING INTO FLOWER THUS THAT I RETURNED A SECOND TIME AND A THIRD
6777-76694-0042 AND ULTIMATELY THIS BEFELL THEY HAD LEFT THE CHURCH DOOR OPEN IN THEIR DUSTING AND ARRANGING WALKING IN TO LOOK AT THE CHURCH I BECAME AWARE BY THE DIM LIGHT OF HIM IN THE PULPIT OF HER IN THE READING DESK
6777-76694-0043 OF HIM LOOKING DOWN OF HER LOOKING UP EXCHANGING TENDER DISCOURSE IMMEDIATELY BOTH DIVED AND BECAME AS IT WERE NON EXISTENT ON THIS SPHERE WITH AN ASSUMPTION OF INNOCENCE I TURNED TO LEAVE THE SACRED EDIFICE
6777-76694-0044 WHEN AN OBESE FORM STOOD IN THE PORTAL PUFFILY DEMANDING JOSEPH OR IN DEFAULT OF JOSEPH CELIA TAKING THIS MONSTER BY THE SLEEVE AND LURING HIM FORTH ON PRETENCE OF SHOWING HIM WHOM HE SOUGHT
6777-76694-0045 I GAVE TIME FOR THE EMERGENCE OF JOSEPH AND CELIA WHO PRESENTLY CAME TOWARDS US IN THE CHURCHYARD BENDING UNDER DUSTY MATTING A PICTURE OF THRIVING AND UNCONSCIOUS INDUSTRY IT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS
6777-76694-0046 BUT SUCH INSTANCES OR ANY TOKENS OF VITALITY ARE RARE INDEED IN MY CITY CHURCHYARDS A FEW SPARROWS OCCASIONALLY TRY TO RAISE A LIVELY CHIRRUP IN THEIR SOLITARY TREE PERHAPS
6777-76694-0047 AS TAKING A DIFFERENT VIEW OF WORMS FROM THAT ENTERTAINED BY HUMANITY BUT THEY ARE FLAT AND HOARSE OF VOICE LIKE THE CLERK THE ORGAN
6777-76694-0048 AND ALL THE REST OF THE CHURCH WORKS WHEN THEY ARE WOUND UP FOR SUNDAY
