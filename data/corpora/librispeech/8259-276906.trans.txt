8259-276906-0000 THE FIRST PERSONS WHOM THEY PASSED BY WERE THREE MEN IN FETTERS WHO WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES VERY MERRILY OVER A BOTTLE OF WINE AND A PIPE OF TOBACCO THESE MISTER ROBINSON INFORMED HIS FRIEND WERE THREE STREET ROBBERS AND WERE ALL CERTAIN OF BEING HANGED THE ENSUING SESSIONS
8259-276906-0001 SO INCONSIDERABLE AN OBJECT SAID HE IS MISERY TO LIGHT MINDS WHEN IT IS AT ANY DISTANCE A LITTLE FARTHER THEY BEHELD A MAN PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND WHOSE HEAVY GROANS AND FRANTIC ACTIONS PLAINLY INDICATED THE HIGHEST DISORDER OF MIND
8259-276906-0002 THIS PERSON WAS IT SEEMS COMMITTED FOR A SMALL FELONY AND HIS WIFE WHO THEN LAY IN UPON HEARING THE NEWS HAD THROWN HERSELF FROM A WINDOW TWO PAIR OF STAIRS HIGH BY WHICH MEANS HE HAD IN ALL PROBABILITY LOST BOTH HER AND HIS CHILD
8259-276906-0003 A VERY PRETTY GIRL THEN ADVANCED TOWARDS THEM WHOSE BEAUTY MISTER BOOTH COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING THE MOMENT HE SAW HER DECLARING AT THE SAME TIME HE THOUGHT SHE HAD GREAT INNOCENCE IN HER COUNTENANCE ROBINSON SAID SHE WAS COMMITTED THITHER AS AN IDLE AND DISORDERLY PERSON AND A COMMON STREET WALKER
8259-276906-0004 AS SHE PAST BY MISTER BOOTH SHE DAMNED HIS EYES AND DISCHARGED A VOLLEY OF WORDS EVERY ONE OF WHICH WAS TOO INDECENT TO BE REPEATED THEY NOW BEHELD A LITTLE CREATURE SITTING BY HERSELF IN A CORNER AND CRYING BITTERLY THIS GIRL MISTER ROBINSON SAID
8259-276906-0005 WAS COMMITTED BECAUSE HER FATHER IN LAW WHO WAS IN THE GRENADIER GUARDS HAD SWORN THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF HIS LIFE OR OF SOME BODILY HARM WHICH SHE WOULD DO HIM AND SHE COULD GET NO SURETIES FOR KEEPING THE PEACE FOR WHICH REASON JUSTICE THRASHER HAD COMMITTED HER TO PRISON
8259-276906-0006 A GREAT NOISE NOW AROSE OCCASIONED BY THE PRISONERS ALL FLOCKING TO SEE A FELLOW WHIPT FOR PETTY LARCENY TO WHICH HE WAS CONDEMNED BY THE COURT OF QUARTER SESSIONS BUT THIS SOON ENDED IN THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE SPECTATORS FOR THE FELLOW AFTER BEING STRIPT HAVING ADVANCED ANOTHER SIXPENCE
8259-276906-0007 WAS DISCHARGED UNTOUCHED THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER BUSTLE BLEAR EYED MOLL AND SEVERAL OF HER COMPANIONS HAVING GOT POSSESSION OF A MAN WHO WAS COMMITTED FOR CERTAIN ODIOUS UNMANLIKE PRACTICES NOT FIT TO BE NAMED WERE GIVING HIM VARIOUS KINDS OF DISCIPLINE
8259-276906-0008 AND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE PUT AN END TO HIM HAD HE NOT BEEN RESCUED OUT OF THEIR HANDS BY AUTHORITY WHEN THIS BUSTLE WAS A LITTLE ALLAYED MISTER BOOTH TOOK NOTICE OF A YOUNG WOMAN IN RAGS SITTING ON THE GROUND AND SUPPORTING THE HEAD OF AN OLD MAN IN HER LAP WHO APPEARED TO BE GIVING UP THE GHOST
8259-276906-0009 THESE MISTER ROBINSON INFORMED HIM WERE FATHER AND DAUGHTER THAT THE LATTER WAS COMMITTED FOR STEALING A LOAF IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE FORMER AND THE FORMER FOR RECEIVING IT KNOWING IT TO BE STOLEN A WELL DREST MAN THEN WALKED SURLILY BY THEM
8259-276906-0010 WHOM MISTER ROBINSON REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED ON AN INDICTMENT FOUND AGAINST HIM FOR A MOST HORRID PERJURY BUT SAYS HE WE EXPECT HIM TO BE BAILED TODAY GOOD HEAVEN CRIES BOOTH CAN SUCH VILLAINS FIND BAIL
8259-276906-0011 AND IS NO PERSON CHARITABLE ENOUGH TO BAIL THAT POOR FATHER AND DAUGHTER OH SIR ANSWERED ROBINSON THE OFFENCE OF THE DAUGHTER BEING FELONY IS HELD NOT TO BE BAILABLE IN LAW WHEREAS PERJURY IS A MISDEMEANOR ONLY
8259-276906-0012 NAY OF ALL PERJURIES THAT OF WHICH THIS MAN IS INDICTED IS THE WORST FOR IT WAS WITH AN INTENTION OF TAKING AWAY THE LIFE OF AN INNOCENT PERSON BY FORM OF LAW AS TO PERJURIES IN CIVIL MATTERS THEY ARE NOT SO VERY CRIMINAL THEY ARE NOT SAID BOOTH AND YET EVEN THESE ARE A MOST
8259-276906-0013 FLAGITIOUS OFFENCE AND WORTHY THE HIGHEST PUNISHMENT SURELY THEY OUGHT TO BE DISTINGUISHED ANSWERED ROBINSON FROM THE OTHERS
8259-276906-0014 COMPARED TO TAKING AWAY HIS LIFE AND HIS REPUTATION AND RUINING HIS FAMILY INTO THE BARGAIN
8259-276906-0015 HOWEVER AT PRESENT THE PUNISHMENT OF ALL PERJURY IS ONLY PILLORY AND TRANSPORTATION FOR SEVEN YEARS AND AS IT IS A TRAVERSABLE AND BAILABLE OFFENCE METHODS ARE FOUND TO ESCAPE ANY PUNISHMENT AT ALL FOOTNOTE
8259-276906-0016 THE TRIAL IS SO LONG POSTPONED AND THE COSTS ARE SO HIGHLY ENCREASED THAT PROSECUTORS ARE OFTEN TIRED OUT AND SOME INCAPACITATED FROM PURSUING VERBUM SAPIENTI BOOTH EXPREST GREAT ASTONISHMENT AT THIS
8259-276906-0017 THIS WAS A WRETCH ALMOST NAKED AND WHO BORE IN HIS COUNTENANCE JOINED TO AN APPEARANCE OF HONESTY THE MARKS OF POVERTY HUNGER AND DISEASE HE HAD MOREOVER A WOODEN LEG AND TWO OR THREE SCARS ON HIS FOREHEAD
8259-276906-0018 THE CASE OF THIS POOR MAN IS INDEED UNHAPPY ENOUGH SAID ROBINSON HE HATH SERVED HIS COUNTRY LOST HIS LIMB AND RECEIVED SEVERAL WOUNDS AT THE SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR WHEN HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL ABROAD HE CAME OVER TO GET INTO THAT OF CHELSEA
8259-276906-0019 BUT COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY AS NONE OF HIS OFFICERS WERE THEN IN ENGLAND IN THE MEAN TIME HE WAS ONE DAY APPREHENDED AND COMMITTED HITHER ON SUSPICION OF STEALING THREE HERRINGS FROM A FISHMONGER HE WAS TRIED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO FOR THIS OFFENCE AND ACQUITTED INDEED
8259-276906-0020 HIS INNOCENCE MANIFESTLY APPEARED AT THE TRIAL BUT HE WAS BROUGHT BACK AGAIN FOR HIS FEES AND HERE HE HATH LAIN EVER SINCE BOOTH EXPREST GREAT HORROR AT THIS ACCOUNT
8259-276906-0021 HE WOULD PAY HIS FEES FOR HIM BUT ADDED THAT HE WAS NOT POSSESSED OF A SINGLE FARTHING IN THE WORLD ROBINSON HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID WITH A SMILE
8259-276906-0022 IT WILL SERVE TO PASS A TEDIOUS HOUR AND MAY DIVERT YOUR THOUGHTS FROM MORE UNPLEASANT SPECULATIONS
8259-276906-0023 YET HE WAS NOT SO EGREGIOUSLY ADDICTED TO THAT VICE AS TO BE TEMPTED BY THE SHABBY PLIGHT OF ROBINSON WHO HAD IF I MAY SO EXPRESS MYSELF NO CHARMS FOR A GAMESTER
8259-276906-0024 IF HE HAD HOWEVER ANY SUCH INCLINATIONS HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW THEM FOR BEFORE HE COULD MAKE ANY ANSWER TO ROBINSON'S PROPOSAL A STRAPPING WENCH CAME UP TO BOOTH
8259-276906-0025 AND TAKING HOLD OF HIS ARM ASKED HIM TO WALK ASIDE WITH HER SAYING WHAT A POX ARE YOU SUCH A FRESH CULL THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW THIS FELLOW WHY HE IS A GAMBLER AND COMMITTED FOR CHEATING AT PLAY THERE IS NOT SUCH A PICKPOCKET IN THE WHOLE QUAD FOOTNOTE
8259-276906-0026 A SCENE OF ALTERCATION NOW ENSUED BETWEEN ROBINSON AND THE LADY WHICH ENDED IN A BOUT AT FISTICUFFS IN WHICH THE LADY WAS GREATLY SUPERIOR TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHILE THE TWO COMBATANTS WERE ENGAGED A GRAVE LOOKING MAN RATHER BETTER DREST THAN THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY
8259-276906-0027 CAME UP TO MISTER BOOTH AND TAKING HIM ASIDE SAID I AM SORRY SIR TO SEE A GENTLEMAN AS YOU APPEAR TO BE IN SUCH INTIMACY WITH THAT RASCAL WHO MAKES NO SCRUPLE OF DISOWNING ALL REVEALED RELIGION AS FOR CRIMES THEY ARE HUMAN ERRORS AND SIGNIFY BUT LITTLE
8259-276906-0028 NAY PERHAPS THE WORSE A MAN IS BY NATURE THE MORE ROOM THERE IS FOR GRACE
8259-276906-0029 WHATEVER YOUR CRIME BE THEREFORE I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU DESPAIR BUT RATHER REJOICE AT IT FOR PERHAPS IT MAY BE THE MEANS OF YOUR BEING CALLED HE RAN ON FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME WITH THIS CANT WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER AND ENDED IN DECLARING HIMSELF A METHODIST
8259-276906-0030 JUST AS THE METHODIST HAD FINISHED HIS DISCOURSE
8259-276906-0031 SHE WAS GENTEEL AND WELL DREST
8259-276906-0032 THAN SHE ASKED WITH A COMMANDING VOICE FOR THE KEEPER AND WHEN HE ARRIVED SHE SAID TO HIM WELL SIR WHITHER AM I TO BE CONDUCTED I HOPE I AM NOT TO TAKE UP MY LODGING WITH THESE CREATURES THE KEEPER ANSWERED WITH A KIND OF SURLY RESPECT
8259-276906-0033 MADAM WE HAVE ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR THEM AT THESE WORDS SHE PULLED A HANDSOME PURSE FROM HER POCKET IN WHICH MANY GUINEAS CHINKED SAYING WITH AN AIR OF INDIGNATION THAT SHE WAS NOT COME THITHER ON ACCOUNT OF POVERTY
8259-276906-0034 THE KEEPER NO SOONER VIEWED THE PURSE THAN HIS FEATURES BECAME ALL SOFTENED IN AN INSTANT AND WITH ALL THE COURTESY OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER HE DESIRED THE LADY TO WALK WITH HIM ASSURING HER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE BEST APARTMENT IN HIS HOUSE MISTER BOOTH WAS NOW LEFT ALONE
8259-276906-0035 HAVING AS THE PHRASE OF THE SECT IS SEARCHED HIM TO THE BOTTOM
8259-276906-0036 BOOTH WAS STANDING NEAR THE GATE OF THE PRISON WHEN THE YOUNG LADY ABOVE MENTIONED WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE YARD HE VIEWED HER FEATURES VERY ATTENTIVELY AND WAS PERSUADED THAT HE KNEW HER
8259-276906-0037 TO WHICH HE WAS ANSWERED THAT HER NAME WAS NOT MATTHEWS BUT VINCENT AND THAT SHE WAS COMMITTED FOR MURDER THE LATTER PART OF THIS INFORMATION MADE MISTER BOOTH SUSPECT HIS MEMORY MORE THAN THE FORMER
8259-276906-0038 FOR IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HER NAME BUT HE HARDLY THOUGHT SHE COULD SO FAR HAVE CHANGED HER NATURE AS TO BE GUILTY OF A CRIME SO VERY INCONGRUOUS WITH HER FORMER GENTLE MANNERS FOR MISS MATTHEWS HAD BOTH THE BIRTH AND EDUCATION OF A GENTLEWOMAN
