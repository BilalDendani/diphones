1944-159230-0000 THE SLATE WAS IN ITS OLD PLACE AND A MESSENGER CAME AND WENT ON HIS BEAT BUT A STRANGE FACE WAS UNDER THE RED CAP AND THIS MAN HAD TWO ARMS AND ONE EYE I ASKED FOR COLLINS
1944-159230-0001 BUT THE NEW COMER HAD ONLY A VAGUE IDEA THAT HE WAS DEAD AND THE SAME ANSWER WAS GIVEN ME AT HEADQUARTERS THOUGH NONE OF THE BUSY PEOPLE SEEMED TO KNOW WHEN OR WHERE HE DIED SO I MOURNED FOR JOE
1944-159230-0002 AND FELT THAT IT WAS VERY HARD HE COULD NOT HAVE LIVED TO ENJOY THE PROMISED REFUGE FOR RELYING UPON THE CHARITY THAT NEVER FAILS THE HOME WAS AN ACTUAL FACT NOW JUST BEGINNING ITS BENEFICENT CAREER
1944-159230-0003 PEOPLE WERE WAKING UP TO THIS DUTY MONEY WAS COMING IN MEETINGS WERE BEING HELD AND ALREADY A FEW POOR FELLOWS WERE IN THE REFUGE FEELING THEMSELVES NO LONGER PAUPERS
1944-159230-0004 BUT INVALID SOLDIERS HONORABLY SUPPORTED BY THE STATE THEY HAD SERVED TALKING IT OVER ONE DAY WITH A FRIEND WHO SPENT HER LIFE WORKING FOR THE ASSOCIATED CHARITIES SHE SAID BY THE WAY
1944-159230-0005 THERE IS A MAN BOARDING WITH ONE OF MY POOR WOMEN WHO OUGHT TO BE GOT INTO THE HOME IF HE WILL GO I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THAT HE WAS IN THE ARMY HAS BEEN VERY ILL WITH RHEUMATIC FEVER AND IS FRIENDLESS
1944-159230-0006 I ASKED MISSUS FLANAGIN HOW SHE MANAGED TO KEEP HIM AND SHE SAID SHE HAD HELP WHILE HE WAS SICK AND NOW HE IS ABLE TO HOBBLE ABOUT HE TAKES CARE OF THE CHILDREN SO SHE IS ABLE TO GO OUT TO WORK
1944-159230-0007 HE WON'T GO TO HIS OWN TOWN BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING FOR HIM THERE BUT THE ALMSHOUSE AND HE DREADS A HOSPITAL SO STRUGGLES ALONG TRYING TO EARN HIS BREAD TENDING BABIES WITH HIS ONE ARM A SAD CASE
1944-159230-0008 AND IN YOUR LINE I WISH YOU'D LOOK INTO IT THAT SOUNDS LIKE MY JOE ONE ARM AND ALL I'LL GO AND SEE HIM I'VE A WEAKNESS FOR SOLDIERS SICK OR WELL I WENT
1944-159230-0009 AND NEVER SHALL FORGET THE PATHETIC LITTLE TABLEAU I SAW AS I OPENED MISSUS FLANAGIN'S DINGY DOOR FOR SHE WAS OUT AND NO ONE HEARD MY TAP THE ROOM WAS REDOLENT OF SUDS
1944-159230-0010 AND IN A GROVE OF DAMP CLOTHES HUNG ON LINES SAT A MAN WITH A CRYING BABY LAID ACROSS HIS LAP WHILE HE FED THREE SMALL CHILDREN STANDING AT HIS KNEE WITH BREAD AND MOLASSES
1944-159230-0011 WAS PAST MY COMPREHENSION BUT HE DID TROTTING BABY GENTLY DEALING OUT SWEET MORSELS PATIENTLY AND WHISTLING TO HIMSELF AS IF TO BEGUILE HIS LABORS CHEERFULLY THE BROAD BACK
1944-159230-0012 THE LONG LEGS THE FADED COAT THE LOW WHISTLE WERE ALL FAMILIAR AND DODGING A WET SHEET I FACED THE MAN TO FIND IT WAS INDEED MY JOE A MERE SHADOW OF HIS FORMER SELF
1944-159230-0013 AFTER MONTHS OF SUFFERING THAT HAD CRIPPLED HIM FOR LIFE BUT BRAVE AND PATIENT STILL TRYING TO HELP HIMSELF AND NOT ASK AID THOUGH BROUGHT SO LOW FOR AN INSTANT
1944-159230-0014 I COULD NOT SPEAK TO HIM AND ENCUMBERED WITH BABY DISH SPOON AND CHILDREN HE COULD ONLY STARE AT ME WITH A SUDDEN BRIGHTENING OF THE ALTERED FACE THAT MADE IT FULL OF WELCOME BEFORE A WORD WAS UTTERED
1944-159230-0015 THERE AIN'T MUCH LEFT OF ME BUT BONES AND PAIN MA'AM I'M POWERFUL GLAD TO SEE YOU ALL THE SAME DUST OFF A CHAIR PATSEY AND LET THE LADY SET DOWN
1944-159230-0016 AND HOW CAME THEY TO THINK YOU DEAD I ASKED AS HE FESTOONED THE WET LINEN OUT OF THE WAY AND PREPARED TO ENJOY HIMSELF AS BEST HE COULD I DID SEND ONCE WHEN THINGS WAS AT THE WUST
1944-159230-0017 BUT YOU HADN'T GOT BACK AND THEN SOMEHOW I THOUGHT I WAS GOIN TO BE MUSTERED OUT FOR GOOD AND SO WOULDN'T TROUBLE NOBODY BUT MY ORDERS AIN'T COME YET AND I AM DOING THE FUST THING THAT COME ALONG
1944-159230-0018 IT AIN'T MUCH BUT THE GOOD SOUL STOOD BY ME AND I AIN'T ASHAMED TO PAY MY DEBTS THIS WAY SENCE I CAN'T DO IT IN NO OTHER
1944-159230-0019 AND JOE CRADLED THE CHUBBY BABY IN HIS ONE ARM AS TENDERLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HIS OWN THOUGH LITTLE BIDDY WAS NOT AN INVITING INFANT THAT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND RIGHT JOE
1944-159230-0020 AND I HONOR YOU FOR IT BUT YOU WERE NOT MEANT TO TEND BABIES SO SING YOUR LAST LULLABIES AND BE READY TO GO TO THE HOME AS SOON AS I CAN GET YOU THERE REALLY MA'AM
1944-159230-0021 I USED TO LAY AND KIND OF DREAM ABOUT IT WHEN I COULDN'T STIR WITHOUT YELLIN OUT BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD EVER COME TO HAPPEN I SEE A PIECE IN THE PAPER DESCRIBING IT AND IT SOUNDED DREADFUL NICE
1944-159230-0022 AS WELL IT MIGHT FOR THE CHANGE FROM THAT DAMP NURSERY TO THE COMFORTABLE QUARTERS PREPARED FOR HIM WOULD BE LIKE GOING FROM PURGATORY TO PARADISE I DON'T WONDER YOU DON'T GET WELL LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE JOE
1944-159230-0023 YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE HOME TO WOOLWICH AND LET YOUR FRIENDS HELP YOU I SAID FEELING PROVOKED WITH HIM FOR HIDING HIMSELF NO MA'AM HE ANSWERED WITH A LOOK I NEVER SHALL FORGET
1944-159230-0024 IT WAS SO FULL OF MINGLED PATIENCE PRIDE AND PAIN I HAVEN'T A RELATION IN THE WORLD BUT A COUPLE OF POOR OLD AUNTS AND THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME
1944-159230-0025 AS FOR ASKING HELP OF FOLKS I USED TO KNOW I COULDN'T DO IT AND IF YOU THINK I'D GO TO LUCINDY THOUGH SHE IS WAL OFF YOU DON'T KNOW JOE COLLINS I'D DIE FUST
1944-159230-0026 IF SHE WAS POOR AND I RICH I'D DO FOR HER LIKE A BROTHER BUT I COULDN'T ASK NO FAVORS OF HER NOT IF I BEGGED MY VITTLES IN THE STREET OR STARVED I FORGIVE
1944-159230-0027 AND THE WOMAN THAT STOOD BY ME WHEN I WAS DOWN IS THE WOMAN I BELIEVE IN AND CAN TAKE MY BREAD FROM WITHOUT SHAME HOORAY FOR BIDDY FLANAGIN GOD BLESS HER
1944-159230-0028 AND AS IF TO FIND A VENT FOR THE EMOTION THAT FILLED HIS EYES WITH GRATEFUL TEARS JOE LED OFF THE CHEER WHICH THE CHILDREN SHRILLY ECHOED AND I JOINED HEARTILY I SHALL COME FOR YOU IN A FEW DAYS
1944-159230-0029 SO CUDDLE THE BABY AND MAKE MUCH OF THE CHILDREN BEFORE YOU PART IT WON'T TAKE YOU LONG TO PACK UP WILL IT I ASKED AS WE SUBSIDED WITH A GENERAL LAUGH I RECKON NOT AS I DON'T OWN ANY CLOTHES BUT WHAT I SET IN
1944-159230-0030 EXCEPT A COUPLE OF OLD SHIRTS AND THEM SOCKS MY HAT'S STOPPIN UP THE WINDER AND MY OLD COAT IS MY BED COVER I'M AWFUL SHABBY MA'AM AND THAT'S ONE REASON I DON'T GO OUT MORE
1944-159230-0031 I CAN HOBBLE SOME BUT I AIN'T GOT USED TO BEIN A SCARECROW YET AND JOE GLANCED FROM THE HOSE WITHOUT HEELS THAT HUNG ON THE LINE TO THE RAGGED SUIT HE WORE WITH A RESIGNED EXPRESSION
1944-159230-0032 THAT MADE ME LONG TO RUSH OUT AND BUY UP HALF THE CONTENTS OF OAK HALL ON THE SPOT CURBING THIS WILD IMPULSE I PRESENTLY DEPARTED WITH PROMISES OF SPEEDY TRANSPORTATION FOR JOE
1944-159230-0033 AND UNLIMITED ORANGES TO ASSUAGE THE PANGS OF PARTING FOR THE YOUNG FLANAGINS WHO ESCORTED ME TO THE DOOR WHILE JOE WAVED THE BABY LIKE A TRIUMPHAL BANNER TILL I GOT ROUND THE CORNER
1944-159230-0034 IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND AND IF A VISITOR WANTS AN ENTHUSIASTIC GUIDE ABOUT THE PLACE JOE IS THE ONE TO TAKE FOR ALL IS COMFORT SUNSHINE AND GOOD WILL TO HIM
1944-159230-0035 AND HE UNCONSCIOUSLY SHOWS HOW GREAT THE NEED OF THIS REFUGE IS AS HE HOBBLES ABOUT ON HIS LAME FEET POINTING OUT ITS BEAUTIES CONVENIENCES AND DELIGHTS WITH HIS ONE ARM
