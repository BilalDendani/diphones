421-124401-0000 PART TWO I WAS THEN IN GERMANY ATTRACTED THITHER BY THE WARS IN THAT COUNTRY WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN BROUGHT TO A TERMINATION AND AS I WAS RETURNING TO THE ARMY FROM THE CORONATION OF THE EMPEROR
421-124401-0001 AND WAS BESIDES FORTUNATELY UNDISTURBED BY ANY CARES OR PASSIONS I REMAINED THE WHOLE DAY IN SECLUSION WITH FULL OPPORTUNITY TO OCCUPY MY ATTENTION WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS
421-124401-0002 OF THESE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS THAT THERE IS SELDOM SO MUCH PERFECTION IN WORKS COMPOSED OF MANY SEPARATE PARTS
421-124401-0003 UPON WHICH DIFFERENT HANDS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED AS IN THOSE COMPLETED BY A SINGLE MASTER THUS IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THE BUILDINGS WHICH A SINGLE ARCHITECT HAS PLANNED AND EXECUTED
421-124401-0004 ARE GENERALLY MORE ELEGANT AND COMMODIOUS THAN THOSE WHICH SEVERAL HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IMPROVE
421-124401-0005 SERVE FOR PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY WERE NOT ORIGINALLY BUILT THUS ALSO THOSE ANCIENT CITIES WHICH FROM BEING AT FIRST ONLY VILLAGES HAVE BECOME IN COURSE OF TIME LARGE TOWNS
421-124401-0006 ARE USUALLY BUT ILL LAID OUT COMPARED WITH THE REGULARITY CONSTRUCTED TOWNS WHICH A PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT HAS FREELY PLANNED ON AN OPEN PLAIN SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE SEVERAL BUILDINGS OF THE FORMER
421-124401-0007 MAY OFTEN EQUAL OR SURPASS IN BEAUTY THOSE OF THE LATTER YET WHEN ONE OBSERVES THEIR INDISCRIMINATE JUXTAPOSITION
421-124401-0008 ONE IS DISPOSED TO ALLEGE THAT CHANCE RATHER THAN ANY HUMAN WILL GUIDED BY REASON MUST HAVE LED TO SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT AND IF WE CONSIDER THAT NEVERTHELESS THERE HAVE BEEN AT ALL TIMES CERTAIN OFFICERS
421-124401-0009 WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO SEE THAT PRIVATE BUILDINGS CONTRIBUTED TO PUBLIC ORNAMENT THE DIFFICULTY OF REACHING HIGH PERFECTION WITH BUT THE MATERIALS OF OTHERS TO OPERATE ON WILL BE READILY ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE SAME WAY
421-124401-0010 I FANCIED THAT THOSE NATIONS WHICH STARTING FROM A SEMI BARBAROUS STATE AND ADVANCING TO CIVILIZATION BY SLOW DEGREES HAVE HAD THEIR LAWS SUCCESSIVELY DETERMINED AND AS IT WERE
421-124401-0011 FORCED UPON THEM SIMPLY BY EXPERIENCE OF THE HURTFULNESS OF PARTICULAR CRIMES AND DISPUTES WOULD BY THIS PROCESS COME TO BE POSSESSED OF LESS PERFECT INSTITUTIONS THAN THOSE WHICH FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR ASSOCIATION AS COMMUNITIES
421-124401-0012 HAVE FOLLOWED THE APPOINTMENTS OF SOME WISE LEGISLATOR IT IS THUS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TRUE RELIGION THE ORDINANCES OF WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM GOD MUST BE INCOMPARABLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF EVERY OTHER
421-124401-0013 AND TO SPEAK OF HUMAN AFFAIRS I BELIEVE THAT THE PRE EMINENCE OF SPARTA WAS DUE NOT TO THE GOODNESS OF EACH OF ITS LAWS IN PARTICULAR FOR MANY OF THESE WERE VERY STRANGE AND EVEN OPPOSED TO GOOD MORALS BUT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
421-124401-0014 IN THE SAME WAY I THOUGHT THAT THE SCIENCES CONTAINED IN BOOKS
421-124401-0015 PROBABLE REASONINGS WITHOUT DEMONSTRATIONS COMPOSED AS THEY ARE OF THE OPINIONS OF MANY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS MASSED TOGETHER ARE FARTHER REMOVED FROM TRUTH THAN THE SIMPLE INFERENCES WHICH A MAN OF GOOD SENSE
421-124401-0016 USING HIS NATURAL AND UNPREJUDICED JUDGMENT DRAWS RESPECTING THE MATTERS OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL TO PASS THROUGH A STATE OF INFANCY TO MANHOOD AND HAVE BEEN OF NECESSITY FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
421-124401-0017 GOVERNED BY OUR DESIRES AND PRECEPTORS WHOSE DICTATES WERE FREQUENTLY CONFLICTING WHILE NEITHER PERHAPS ALWAYS COUNSELED US FOR THE BEST I FARTHER CONCLUDED THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT OUR JUDGMENTS CAN BE SO CORRECT OR SOLID
421-124401-0018 AND HAD WE ALWAYS BEEN GUIDED BY IT ALONE IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO PULL DOWN ALL THE HOUSES OF A TOWN WITH THE SINGLE DESIGN OF REBUILDING THEM DIFFERENTLY
421-124401-0019 AND THEREBY RENDERING THE STREETS MORE HANDSOME BUT IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TAKES DOWN HIS OWN WITH THE VIEW OF ERECTING IT ANEW AND THAT PEOPLE ARE EVEN SOMETIMES CONSTRAINED TO THIS WHEN THEIR HOUSES ARE IN DANGER OF FALLING FROM AGE
421-124401-0020 OR WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS ARE INSECURE WITH THIS BEFORE ME BY WAY OF EXAMPLE I WAS PERSUADED THAT IT WOULD INDEED BE PREPOSTEROUS FOR A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TO THINK OF REFORMING A STATE BY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING IT THROUGHOUT
421-124401-0021 AND OVERTURNING IT IN ORDER TO SET IT UP AMENDED AND THE SAME I THOUGHT WAS TRUE OF ANY SIMILAR PROJECT FOR REFORMING THE BODY OF THE SCIENCES OR THE ORDER OF TEACHING THEM ESTABLISHED IN THE SCHOOLS
421-124401-0022 BUT AS FOR THE OPINIONS WHICH UP TO THAT TIME I HAD EMBRACED I THOUGHT THAT I COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN RESOLVE AT ONCE TO SWEEP THEM WHOLLY AWAY THAT I MIGHT AFTERWARDS BE IN A POSITION TO ADMIT EITHER OTHERS MORE CORRECT
421-124401-0023 I SHOULD MUCH BETTER SUCCEED IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE THAN IF I BUILT ONLY UPON OLD FOUNDATIONS AND LEANED UPON PRINCIPLES WHICH IN MY YOUTH I HAD TAKEN UPON TRUST
421-124401-0024 FOR ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZED VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES IN THIS UNDERTAKING THESE WERE NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT REMEDY NOR ONCE TO BE COMPARED WITH SUCH AS ATTEND THE SLIGHTEST REFORMATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS LARGE BODIES
421-124401-0025 IF ONCE OVERTHROWN ARE WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY SET UP AGAIN OR EVEN KEPT ERECT WHEN ONCE SERIOUSLY SHAKEN AND THE FALL OF SUCH IS ALWAYS DISASTROUS THEN IF THERE ARE ANY IMPERFECTIONS IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF STATES
421-124401-0026 AND THAT MANY SUCH EXIST THE DIVERSITY OF CONSTITUTIONS IS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO ASSURE US CUSTOM HAS WITHOUT DOUBT MATERIALLY SMOOTHED THEIR INCONVENIENCES AND HAS EVEN MANAGED TO STEER ALTOGETHER CLEAR OF
421-124401-0027 OR INSENSIBLY CORRECTED A NUMBER WHICH SAGACITY COULD NOT HAVE PROVIDED AGAINST WITH EQUAL EFFECT AND IN FINE THE DEFECTS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS MORE TOLERABLE
421-124401-0028 THAT I CANNOT IN ANY DEGREE APPROVE OF THOSE RESTLESS AND BUSY MEDDLERS WHO CALLED NEITHER BY BIRTH NOR FORTUNE TO TAKE PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARE YET ALWAYS PROJECTING REFORMS
421-124401-0029 AND IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS TRACT CONTAINED AUGHT WHICH MIGHT JUSTIFY THE SUSPICION THAT I WAS A VICTIM OF SUCH FOLLY I WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT ITS PUBLICATION
421-124401-0030 I HAVE NEVER CONTEMPLATED ANYTHING HIGHER THAN THE REFORMATION OF MY OWN OPINIONS AND BASING THEM ON A FOUNDATION WHOLLY MY OWN AND ALTHOUGH MY OWN SATISFACTION WITH MY WORK HAS LED ME TO PRESENT HERE A DRAFT OF IT
421-124401-0031 I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS THEREFORE RECOMMEND TO EVERY ONE ELSE TO MAKE A SIMILAR ATTEMPT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS ENDOWED WITH A LARGER MEASURE OF GENIUS WILL ENTERTAIN PERHAPS DESIGNS STILL MORE EXALTED
421-124401-0032 THE SINGLE DESIGN TO STRIP ONE'S SELF OF ALL PAST BELIEFS IS ONE THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE TAKEN BY EVERY ONE THE MAJORITY OF MEN IS COMPOSED OF TWO CLASSES
421-124401-0033 FOR NEITHER OF WHICH WOULD THIS BE AT ALL A BEFITTING RESOLUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THOSE WHO WITH MORE THAN A DUE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN POWERS ARE PRECIPITATE IN THEIR JUDGMENTS AND WANT THE PATIENCE REQUISITE FOR ORDERLY AND CIRCUMSPECT THINKING
421-124401-0034 WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF MEN OF THIS CLASS ONCE TAKE THE LIBERTY TO DOUBT OF THEIR ACCUSTOMED OPINIONS AND QUIT THE BEATEN HIGHWAY THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO THREAD THE BYWAY THAT WOULD LEAD THEM BY A SHORTER COURSE
421-124401-0035 AND WILL LOSE THEMSELVES AND CONTINUE TO WANDER FOR LIFE IN THE SECOND PLACE OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED OF SUFFICIENT SENSE OR MODESTY TO DETERMINE THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO EXCEL THEM IN THE POWER OF DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN TRUTH AND ERROR
421-124401-0036 AND BY WHOM THEY MAY BE INSTRUCTED OUGHT RATHER TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE OPINIONS OF SUCH THAN TRUST FOR MORE CORRECT TO THEIR OWN REASON FOR MY OWN PART
421-124401-0037 I SHOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BELONGED TO THE LATTER CLASS HAD I RECEIVED INSTRUCTION FROM BUT ONE MASTER OR HAD I NEVER KNOWN THE DIVERSITIES OF OPINION THAT FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAVE PREVAILED AMONG MEN OF THE GREATEST LEARNING
421-124401-0038 BUT I HAD BECOME AWARE EVEN SO EARLY AS DURING MY COLLEGE LIFE THAT NO OPINION HOWEVER ABSURD AND INCREDIBLE CAN BE IMAGINED WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MAINTAINED BY SOME ON OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AND AFTERWARDS
421-124401-0039 WHOSE OPINIONS ARE DECIDEDLY REPUGNANT TO OURS ARE NOT IN THAT ACCOUNT BARBARIANS AND SAVAGES BUT ON THE CONTRARY THAT MANY OF THESE NATIONS MAKE AN EQUALLY GOOD IF NOT BETTER USE OF THEIR REASON THAN WE DO
421-124401-0040 I TOOK INTO ACCOUNT ALSO THE VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER WHICH A PERSON BROUGHT UP FROM INFANCY IN FRANCE OR GERMANY EXHIBITS FROM THAT WHICH
421-124401-0041 OR WITH SAVAGES AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN DRESS ITSELF THE FASHION WHICH PLEASED US TEN YEARS AGO AND WHICH MAY AGAIN PERHAPS BE RECEIVED INTO FAVOR BEFORE TEN YEARS HAVE GONE APPEARS TO US AT THIS MOMENT EXTRAVAGANT
421-124401-0042 AND RIDICULOUS I WAS THUS LED TO INFER THAT THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS IS FAR MORE CUSTOM AND EXAMPLE THAN ANY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND FINALLY ALTHOUGH SUCH BE THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS
421-124401-0043 I REMARKED THAT A PLURALITY OF SUFFRAGES IS NO GUARANTEE OF TRUTH WHERE IT IS AT ALL OF DIFFICULT DISCOVERY AS IN SUCH CASES IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE FOUND BY ONE THAN BY MANY
421-124401-0044 AS IT WERE TO USE MY OWN REASON IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE BUT LIKE ONE WALKING ALONE AND IN THE DARK I RESOLVED TO PROCEED SO SLOWLY AND WITH SUCH CIRCUMSPECTION
421-124401-0045 THAT IF I DID NOT ADVANCE FAR I WOULD AT LEAST GUARD AGAINST FALLING I DID NOT EVEN CHOOSE TO DISMISS SUMMARILY ANY OF THE OPINIONS THAT HAD CREPT INTO MY BELIEF WITHOUT HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED BY REASON BUT FIRST OF ALL TOOK SUFFICIENT TIME
421-124401-0046 CAREFULLY TO SATISFY MYSELF OF THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE TASK I WAS SETTING MYSELF AND ASCERTAIN THE TRUE METHOD BY WHICH TO ARRIVE AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHATEVER LAY WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY POWERS
421-124401-0047 AMONG THE BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY I HAD AT AN EARLIER PERIOD GIVEN SOME ATTENTION TO LOGIC AND AMONG THOSE OF THE MATHEMATICS TO GEOMETRICAL ANALYSIS AND ALGEBRA
421-124401-0048 THREE ARTS OR SCIENCES WHICH OUGHT AS I CONCEIVED TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO MY DESIGN BUT ON EXAMINATION I FOUND THAT AS FOR LOGIC ITS SYLLOGISMS
421-124401-0049 AND THE MAJORITY OF ITS OTHER PRECEPTS ARE OF AVAIL RATHER IN THE COMMUNICATION OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW OR EVEN AS THE ART OF LULLY IN SPEAKING WITHOUT JUDGMENT OF THINGS OF WHICH WE ARE IGNORANT THAN IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE UNKNOWN
421-124401-0050 AND ALTHOUGH THIS SCIENCE CONTAINS INDEED A NUMBER OF CORRECT AND VERY EXCELLENT PRECEPTS THERE ARE NEVERTHELESS SO MANY OTHERS AND THESE
421-124401-0051 EITHER INJURIOUS OR SUPERFLUOUS MINGLED WITH THE FORMER THAT IT IS ALMOST QUITE AS DIFFICULT TO EFFECT A SEVERANCE OF THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE AS IT IS TO EXTRACT A DIANA OR A MINERVA FROM A ROUGH BLOCK OF MARBLE
421-124401-0052 THEN AS TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ANCIENTS AND THE ALGEBRA OF THE MODERNS BESIDES THAT THEY EMBRACE ONLY MATTERS HIGHLY ABSTRACT AND TO APPEARANCE OF NO USE THE FORMER IS SO EXCLUSIVELY RESTRICTED
421-124401-0053 TO THE CONSIDERATION OF FIGURES THAT IT CAN EXERCISE THE UNDERSTANDING ONLY ON CONDITION OF GREATLY FATIGUING THE IMAGINATION AND IN THE LATTER THERE IS SO COMPLETE A SUBJECTION TO CERTAIN RULES AND FORMULAS
421-124401-0054 BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS I WAS INDUCED TO SEEK SOME OTHER METHOD WHICH WOULD COMPRISE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE THREE AND BE EXEMPT FROM THEIR DEFECTS AND AS A MULTITUDE OF LAWS OFTEN ONLY HAMPERS JUSTICE
421-124401-0055 SO THAT A STATE IS BEST GOVERNED WHEN WITH FEW LAWS THESE ARE RIGIDLY ADMINISTERED IN LIKE MANNER INSTEAD OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF PRECEPTS OF WHICH LOGIC IS COMPOSED I BELIEVED THAT THE FOUR FOLLOWING WOULD PROVE PERFECTLY SUFFICIENT FOR ME
421-124401-0056 PROVIDED I TOOK THE FIRM AND UNWAVERING RESOLUTION NEVER IN A SINGLE INSTANCE TO FAIL IN OBSERVING THEM THE FIRST WAS NEVER TO ACCEPT ANYTHING FOR TRUE
421-124401-0057 WHICH I DID NOT CLEARLY KNOW TO BE SUCH THAT IS TO SAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID PRECIPITANCY AND PREJUDICE AND TO COMPRISE NOTHING MORE IN MY JUDGEMENT THAN WHAT WAS PRESENTED
421-124401-0058 TO MY MIND SO CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY AS TO EXCLUDE ALL GROUND OF DOUBT THE SECOND
421-124401-0059 AND AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR ITS ADEQUATE SOLUTION THE THIRD TO CONDUCT MY THOUGHTS IN SUCH ORDER THAT BY COMMENCING WITH OBJECTS THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW
421-124401-0060 I MIGHT ASCEND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND AS IT WERE STEP BY STEP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MORE COMPLEX ASSIGNING IN THOUGHT A CERTAIN ORDER EVEN TO THOSE OBJECTS WHICH IN THEIR OWN NATURE DO NOT STAND IN A RELATION OF ANTECEDENCE AND SEQUENCE
421-124401-0061 AND THE LAST IN EVERY CASE TO MAKE ENUMERATIONS SO COMPLETE AND REVIEWS SO GENERAL THAT I MIGHT BE ASSURED THAT NOTHING WAS OMITTED
421-124401-0062 THE LONG CHAINS OF SIMPLE AND EASY REASONINGS BY MEANS OF WHICH GEOMETERS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REACH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THEIR MOST DIFFICULT DEMONSTRATIONS
421-124401-0063 HAD LED ME TO IMAGINE THAT ALL THINGS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH MAN IS COMPETENT ARE MUTUALLY CONNECTED IN THE SAME WAY AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING SO FAR REMOVED FROM US AS TO BE BEYOND OUR REACH OR SO HIDDEN
421-124401-0064 THAT WE CANNOT DISCOVER IT PROVIDED ONLY WE ABSTAIN FROM ACCEPTING THE FALSE FOR THE TRUE AND ALWAYS PRESERVE IN OUR THOUGHTS THE ORDER NECESSARY FOR THE DEDUCTION OF ONE TRUTH FROM ANOTHER AND
421-124401-0065 I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
421-124401-0066 TRUTH IN THE SCIENCES THE MATHEMATICIANS ALONE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY DEMONSTRATIONS THAT IS ANY CERTAIN AND EVIDENT REASONS I DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT SUCH MUST HAVE BEEN THE RULE OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
421-124401-0067 I RESOLVED TO COMMENCE THEREFORE WITH THE EXAMINATION OF THE SIMPLEST OBJECTS NOT ANTICIPATING HOWEVER FROM THIS ANY OTHER ADVANTAGE THAN THAT TO BE FOUND IN ACCUSTOMING
421-124401-0068 MY MIND TO THE LOVE AND NOURISHMENT OF TRUTH AND TO A DISTASTE FOR ALL SUCH REASONINGS AS WERE UNSOUND BUT I HAD NO INTENTION ON THAT ACCOUNT OF ATTEMPTING TO MASTER ALL
421-124401-0069 THE PARTICULAR SCIENCES COMMONLY DENOMINATED MATHEMATICS BUT OBSERVING THAT HOWEVER DIFFERENT THEIR OBJECTS THEY ALL AGREE IN CONSIDERING ONLY THE VARIOUS RELATIONS OR PROPORTIONS
421-124401-0070 SUBSISTING AMONG THOSE OBJECTS I THOUGHT IT BEST FOR MY PURPOSE TO CONSIDER THESE PROPORTIONS IN THE MOST GENERAL FORM POSSIBLE WITHOUT REFERRING THEM TO ANY OBJECTS IN PARTICULAR
421-124401-0071 AND WITHOUT BY ANY MEANS RESTRICTING THEM TO THESE THAT AFTERWARDS I MIGHT THUS BE THE BETTER ABLE TO APPLY THEM TO EVERY OTHER CLASS OF OBJECTS TO WHICH THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY APPLICABLE
421-124401-0072 PERCEIVING FURTHER THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE RELATIONS I SHOULD SOMETIMES HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM ONE BY ONE AND SOMETIMES ONLY TO BEAR THEM IN MIND OR EMBRACE THEM IN THE AGGREGATE
421-124401-0073 I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER THE BETTER TO CONSIDER THEM INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD VIEW THEM AS SUBSISTING BETWEEN STRAIGHT LINES THAN WHICH I COULD FIND NO OBJECTS MORE SIMPLE
421-124401-0074 OR CAPABLE OF BEING MORE DISTINCTLY REPRESENTED TO MY IMAGINATION AND SENSES AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IN ORDER TO RETAIN THEM IN THE MEMORY OR EMBRACE AN AGGREGATE OF MANY I SHOULD EXPRESS THEM BY CERTAIN CHARACTERS
421-124401-0075 THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE IN THIS WAY I BELIEVED THAT I COULD BORROW ALL THAT WAS BEST BOTH IN GEOMETRICAL ANALYSIS AND IN ALGEBRA AND CORRECT ALL THE DEFECTS OF THE ONE BY HELP OF THE OTHER
421-124401-0076 AND IN POINT OF FACT THE ACCURATE OBSERVANCE OF THESE FEW PRECEPTS GAVE ME I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF SAYING SUCH EASE IN UNRAVELING ALL THE QUESTIONS EMBRACED IN THESE TWO SCIENCES
421-124401-0077 THAT IN THE TWO OR THREE MONTHS I DEVOTED TO THEIR EXAMINATION NOT ONLY DID I REACH SOLUTIONS OF QUESTIONS I HAD FORMERLY DEEMED EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT BUT EVEN AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF THE SOLUTION OF WHICH I CONTINUED IGNORANT
421-124401-0078 I WAS ENABLED AS IT APPEARED TO ME TO DETERMINE THE MEANS WHEREBY AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH A SOLUTION WAS POSSIBLE
421-124401-0079 RESULTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I COMMENCED WITH THE SIMPLEST AND MOST GENERAL TRUTHS AND THAT THUS EACH TRUTH DISCOVERED WAS A RULE AVAILABLE IN THE DISCOVERY OF SUBSEQUENT ONES
421-124401-0080 NOR IN THIS PERHAPS SHALL I APPEAR TOO VAIN IF IT BE CONSIDERED THAT AS THE TRUTH ON ANY PARTICULAR POINT IS ONE WHOEVER APPREHENDS THE TRUTH KNOWS ALL THAT ON THAT POINT CAN BE KNOWN
421-124401-0081 THE CHILD FOR EXAMPLE WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE ELEMENTS OF ARITHMETIC AND HAS MADE A PARTICULAR ADDITION ACCORDING TO RULE
421-124401-0082 IN THIS INSTANCE IS WITHIN THE REACH OF HUMAN GENIUS NOW IN CONCLUSION THE METHOD WHICH TEACHES ADHERENCE TO THE TRUE ORDER AND AN EXACT ENUMERATION OF ALL THE CONDITIONS OF THE THING SOUGHT
421-124401-0083 INCLUDES ALL THAT GIVES CERTITUDE TO THE RULES OF ARITHMETIC BUT THE CHIEF GROUND OF MY SATISFACTION WITH THUS METHOD
421-124401-0084 WAS THE ASSURANCE I HAD OF THEREBY EXERCISING MY REASON IN ALL MATTERS IF NOT WITH ABSOLUTE PERFECTION AT LEAST WITH THE GREATEST ATTAINABLE BY ME BESIDES I WAS CONSCIOUS
421-124401-0085 THAT BY ITS USE MY MIND WAS BECOMING GRADUALLY HABITUATED TO CLEARER AND MORE DISTINCT CONCEPTIONS OF ITS OBJECTS AND I HOPED ALSO FROM NOT HAVING RESTRICTED THIS METHOD TO ANY PARTICULAR MATTER TO APPLY IT TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE OTHER SCIENCES
421-124401-0086 FOR THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTRARY TO THE ORDER PRESCRIBED IN THE METHOD
421-124401-0087 IN WHICH I FOUND NOTHING CERTAIN I THOUGHT IT NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO ENDEAVOR TO ESTABLISH ITS PRINCIPLES AND BECAUSE I OBSERVED
421-124401-0088 AND ONE IN WHICH PRECIPITANCY AND ANTICIPATION IN JUDGMENT WERE MOST TO BE DREADED I THOUGHT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO APPROACH IT TILL I HAD REACHED A MORE MATURE AGE BEING AT THAT TIME BUT TWENTY THREE
421-124401-0089 EMPLOYED MUCH OF MY TIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE WORK AS WELL BY ERADICATING FROM MY MIND ALL THE ERRONEOUS OPINIONS I HAD UP TO THAT MOMENT ACCEPTED AS BY AMASSING VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE TO AFFORD MATERIALS FOR MY REASONINGS
421-124401-0090 AND BY CONTINUALLY EXERCISING MYSELF IN MY CHOSEN METHOD
