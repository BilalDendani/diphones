1212-75242-0000 THAT EVENING THE DOCTOR HAD NO CALLS TO MAKE SO ZIP WAS LEFT TO AMUSE HIMSELF AS BEST HE COULD HE HAD FINISHED TELLING TABBY ABOUT THE MONKEY AND THE TURKEY AND WAS WONDERING WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF WHEN HE HEARD CHILDREN LAUGHING IN THE BACK YARD OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE
1212-75242-0001 LOOKING UP HE SAW THAT THE HOUSE WAS LIGHTED MORE THAN WAS USUAL AND HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT THEY MUST BE HAVING A LITTLE DANCE OR A CHILDREN'S PARTY OF SOME KIND JUST THEN HE THOUGHT HE GOT A WHIFF OF BOILING MOLASSES
1212-75242-0002 HE STUCK HIS NOSE UP IN THE AIR AND GAVE A LONG SNIFF YES IT WAS MOLASSES HE SMELLED THEY ARE HAVING A CANDY PULL THAT'S WHAT IS GOING ON
1212-75242-0003 AND THEN PERHAPS I CAN SNEAK INTO THE KITCHEN AND STEAL A PIECE OF CAKE THOUGHT ZIP BUT ALAS HE WAS SO BUSY GAZING UP AT THE LIGHTED WINDOWS TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE HOUSE THAT HE NEGLECTED TO LOOK WHERE HE WAS STEPPING
1212-75242-0004 AND THE FIRST THING HE KNEW HE WAS STANDING WITH ALL FOUR FEET IN A PAN OF HOT MOLASSES CANDY
1212-75242-0005 THE CANDY WAS JUST IN THAT STATE OF COOLING WHEN THE TOP IS A LITTLE HARD AND THE BOTTOM IS SOFT AND STICKY SO WHEN HE TRIED TO LIFT HIS FEET THE CANDY PULLED UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AND MADE LONG STRINGY ENDS
1212-75242-0006 BUT DID NOT LEAVE HIS FEET INSTEAD IT GOT BETWEEN HIS TOES AND HELD HIM STILL FASTER HE TRIED TO BITE IT OFF BUT INSTEAD OF COMING OFF
1212-75242-0007 IT ONLY STUCK TO HIS TEETH AND HE FOUND HIMSELF STICKING TO THE PAN WITH HIS MOUTH AS WELL AS HIS FEET INDEED HE WAS HELD SECURELY BY THE STICKY STRINGY CANDY
1212-75242-0008 HE COULD NOT STAND IT TO HAVE THESE CHILDREN HE SAW EVERY DAY FIND HIM IN SUCH A FIX HE WOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT SO HE MADE A FRANTIC EFFORT TO LOOSEN HIMSELF IN DOING THIS HE PULLED BACKWARDS SO FAR
1212-75242-0009 THAT HIS FEET SLIPPED SOMEHOW AND HE SAT DOWN IN THE CANDY AND NOW HE WAS CAUGHT FOR HIS FOUR FEET
1212-75242-0010 WAS A BIG BALL OF MOLASSES CANDY ROLLING DOWN THE SLOPING WALK ALL THEY COULD SEE IN THE SEMI DARKNESS WAS THE CANDY FOR ZIP WAS TOO BALLED UP TO SHOW A BIT OF DOG STICKING OUT OF THE SOFT MESS
1212-75242-0011 THE CHILDREN RAN AFTER IT SCREAMING WITH LAUGHTER BUT WHEN THEY CAUGHT UP TO THE ROLLING BALL AND DISCOVERED THEIR WELL KNOWN MISCHIEVOUS ZIP ROLLED UP SO TIGHT HE WAS HELPLESS THEY CLAPPED THEIR HANDS WITH DELIGHT
1212-75242-0012 THE LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS GIVING THE PARTY LET'S PUT HIM IN THE BATH TUB AND SOAK IT OFF JUST THE VERY THING ONE OF THE BOYS REPLIED WAIT TILL I GET SOMETHING TO WRAP HIM IN SO I WON'T GET ALL STUCK UP WITH THE CANDY
1212-75242-0013 ON HEARING THIS ZIP BEGAN TO STRUGGLE AND SQUIRM FOR HE HAD VISIONS OF HOT WATER AND SOAPSUDS IN HIS EYES WITH EACH ONE OF THE CHILDREN FEELING IT WAS THEIR DUTY TO GIVE HIM AN EXTRA SCRUB HERE
1212-75242-0014 YOU ZIP KEEP STILL OR YOU'LL SLIP OUT OF THE APRON YOU'RE WRAPPED IN AND GET MY BEST SUIT ALL STICKY CALLED THE LITTLE BOY WHO HELD HIM IN HIS ARMS AND WAS CARRYING HIM UP TO THE BATHROOM BY SQUEEZING HIM TIGHTLY
1212-75242-0015 THE BOY MANAGED TO GET HIM TO THE ROOM AND WAS JUST ABOUT TO DROP HIM IN THE TUB FROM THE APRON WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT THE APRON WAS STICKING TO THE CANDY ONE OF THE BOYS GAVE IT A JERK TO LOOSEN IT BUT SAD TO RELATE HE GAVE TOO VIGOROUS A PULL
1212-75242-0016 AND ZIP DROPPED FROM THE BOY'S ARMS NOT INTO THE TUB BUT AT ONE SIDE AND BY A MIGHTY EFFORT HE GAVE HIMSELF TWO ROLLS WHICH BROUGHT HIM TO THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS ANOTHER ROLL SENT HIM TUMBLING BUMPETY BUMP DOWN THE LONG FLIGHT THAT LED TO THE KITCHEN
1212-75242-0017 ON THE WAY HE HIT A HAMPER OF CLOTHES ON THE LANDING AND IT JOINED HIM AND WENT BUMPETY BUMP BANGETY BANG TO THE BOTTOM AND OUT INTO THE KITCHEN HITTING THE WAITRESS WHO WAS CARRYING A TRAY OF GLASSES FILLED WITH FRUIT LEMONADE
1212-75242-0018 THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF A HAMPER APPARENTLY ON LEGS COMING TOWARD HER SURPRISED HER BUT NOTHING LIKE THE QUEER THING THAT WAS ROLLING ABOUT HER FEET AND WHICH SHE COULD NOT SEE FOR THE BIG TRAY IN HER HANDS SHE COULD NOT SEEM TO ESCAPE IT
1212-75242-0019 THIS BROUGHT MORE OF THE GUESTS TO THE SPOT AND YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED COULD YOU HAVE SEEN THEIR FACES WHEN FIRST THEY PEERED INTO THE KITCHEN
1212-75242-0020 A FEW FEET FROM THE DOOR WAS THE MAID SITTING WITH LIMBS OUTSPREAD TOO DAZED TO MOVE WHILE FROM UNDER THE CORNER OF HER SKIRT ROLLED A BIG STICKY BALL OF SOME KIND THAT HOWLED AS IT ROLLED
1212-75242-0021 BEYOND HIM WAS AN OVERTURNED HAMPER OF SOILED CLOTHES WITH STOCKINGS COLLARS SHEETS AND PETTICOATS SPILLING OUT OF IT AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM STOOD MISSUS HARDWAY WIPING THE LEMONADE OFF HER DRESS
1212-75242-0022 AS ZIP WAS STILL IN A BALL AND COULD NOT EXTRICATE HIMSELF THE SAME BOY WHO HAD CARRIED HIM TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE PUT THE APRON AROUND HIM AGAIN AND TOOK HIM BACK UPSTAIRS
1212-75242-0023 THIS TIME THEY GOT HIM IN THE TUB SAFELY AND BEGAN TO TURN THE WATER IN THE TUB WAS SLIPPERY AND SO WAS THE CANDY AND AS THE WATER CREPT UP TO WHERE ZIP WAS TIED NOT HAND AND FOOT BUT WORSE STILL
1212-75242-0024 HEAD NOSE EARS AND ALL FOUR LEGS AS WELL AS TAIL HE HOWLED AND HOWLED UNTIL ONE COULD HAVE HEARD HIM A BLOCK AWAY HE WAS SO AFRAID OF BEING DROWNED BEFORE THE WATER WOULD SOAK OFF THE CANDY
1212-75242-0025 AND WHEN THE CHILDREN TRIED TO PULL IT OFF IT NEARLY KILLED HIM WITH PAIN FOR IT TOOK ALL THE LITTLE FINE HAIRS OF HIS COAT WITH IT THE WINDOW OF THE BATHROOM WAS OPEN AND THE DOCTOR COMING OUT ON HIS FRONT PORCH TO LOOK AT THE SKY BEFORE RETIRING
1212-75242-0026 HEARD ZIP HOWLING SOMEWHERE ACROSS THE STREET HE WAS CRYING IN SUCH A PITIFUL FRIGHTENED MANNER THAT THE DOCTOR KNEW HE MUST BE FAST SOMEWHERE OR HURT SO HE COULD NOT GET HOME
1212-75242-0027 WITH THE WORRIED TABBY CLOSE AT HIS HEELS THE DOCTOR MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE HOUSE AND STABLE YARD BUT COULD FIND NO ZIP THE HOWLS SEEMED TO COME FROM UP IN THE AIR SOMEWHERE AS FROM THE TOP OF THE HOUSE
1212-75242-0028 SO FINALLY THE DOCTOR RAPPED ON THE HARDWAY KITCHEN DOOR TO ASK THE MAID IF ZIP HAD NOT SLIPPED IN THE HOUSE AND GOTTEN UP ON THE ROOF HE KNOCKED REPEATEDLY BUT NO ONE ANSWERED AS HE STILL HEARD ZIP HOWLING
1212-75242-0029 AND SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE TALKING ALL AT ONCE HE MADE BOLD TO OPEN THE DOOR AND STEP IN WHAT HE SAW YOU ALREADY KNOW AS BY THIS TIME THE CHILDREN HAD STARTED TO BATHE ZIP THE DOCTOR WAS TOLD TO GO RIGHT UPSTAIRS
1212-75242-0030 WHEN HE APPEARED IN THE DOOR ALL THE CHILDREN STOPPED LAUGHING AND STEPPED BACK TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO SEE ZIP AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAW JUST ONE OF ZIP'S EYES STUCK OUT OF A HOLE WHERE THE CANDY HAD DROPPED OFF
1212-75242-0031 AND HIS POOR LITTLE TAIL STUCK OUT LIKE A HANDLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALL THAT WAS ALL THAT COULD BE SEEN OF ZIP AT THAT MOMENT FOR IN HIS NUMEROUS ROLLS THE CANDY HAD SPREAD ALL OVER HIM UNTIL HE WAS NO LONGER A DOG WITH LEGS
1212-75242-0032 BUT JUST ONE ROUND BALL OF MOLASSES CANDY SEEING THE WATER WAS FAST CLIMBING UP TO WHERE IT WOULD REACH ZIP'S MOUTH AND KNOWING IT WOULD DROWN HIM THE DOCTOR TURNED OFF THE SPIGOT
1212-75242-0033 THE CHILDREN HAD NEVER THOUGHT THAT THE POOR DOG COULD NOT MOVE HIS HEAD TO KEEP OUT OF THE WATER NOW THE DOCTOR HURRIEDLY TOOK OFF HIS COAT ROLLED UP HIS SLEEVES AND IN A JIFFY HAD ZIP AND THE MOLASSES BALL IN HIS HANDS
1212-75242-0034 AND WAS HOLDING IT SO THAT THE WATER COULD NOT GET TO ZIP'S HEAD THEN WITH ONE HAND HE GENTLY THREW THE WATER UPON THE CANDY UNTIL IT BEGAN TO LOOSEN AND FALL OFF FIRST HE RELEASED THE LITTLE DOG'S HEAD
1212-75242-0035 WHICH HAD BEEN BENT DOWN BETWEEN HIS FORE LEGS AS THE CANDY BEGAN TO LOOSEN AND DROP OFF FIRST ONE BLACK EAR STOOD UP AND THEN THE OTHER AND LAST THE LITTLE LEGS BEGAN TO SHOOT OUT
1212-75242-0036 ALL THIS MADE THE CHILDREN LAUGH TO SEE WHAT APPEARED TO BE A BIG BALL OF CANDY DEVELOP INTO A LITTLE DOG AT LAST WHEN ZIP WAS ENTIRELY CLEAN AND HAD BEEN WRAPPED IN A BIG BATH TOWEL TO DRY
1212-75242-0037 SO WHEN THE DOCTOR BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE MISSUS HARDWAY STOPPED HIM SHORT AND TOLD HIM TO DRINK ZIP'S HEALTH IN A GLASS OF FRESHLY MADE LEMONADE AND SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT THE DOCTOR THANKING HER FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART
1212-75242-0038 DRANK NOT TO ZIP'S HEALTH BUT TO HERS AND THUS THE EXCITING EVENING ENDED PEACEFULLY AND EVERYONE WAS HAPPY INCLUDING ZIP AS THE DOCTOR GAVE HIM ALL THE MARASCHINO CHERRIES IN HIS GLASS SOMETHING HE DEARLY LOVED
