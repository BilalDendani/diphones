4226-12707-0002 WHEN MEAT IS FROZEN IT SHOULD BE PUT INTO LUKEWARM WATER AND NOT TAKEN OUT TILL THE FROST IS EXTRACTED IF THERE IS ANY FROST IN IT WHEN PUT TO THE FIRE IT WILL NOT COOK WELL THE BEST WAY TO BOIL IT IS TO PUT IT IN COLD WATER AND BOIL IT GENTLY

4226-12707-0005 PROVIDED YOU MAKE A SOUP OF THE LIQUOR IF NOT IT IS THE DEAREST AS MOST OF THE GELATINE IS EXTRACTED BY THE PROCESS OF BOILING WHICH IS THE MOST NOURISHING PART AND IF NOT USED FOR SOUP IS COMPLETELY LOST IN ROASTING MEAT ONLY THE JUICES AND FAT ARE EXTRACTED
4226-12707-0006 BUT NOT LOST AS THE JUICES MAKE GOOD GRAVY AND THE FAT IS GOOD FOR VARIOUS CULINARY PURPOSES WHEN IT IS PUT DOWN TO ROAST THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE WATER IN THE DRIPPING PAN FOR BROILING THE BARS OF THE GRIDIRON SHOULD BE PERFECTLY CLEAN AND GREASED WITH LARD OR BUTTER
4226-12707-0007 OTHERWISE THE MEAT WILL RETAIN THE IMPRESSION OF THE BARS THE BARS OF THE GRIDIRON SHOULD BE CONCAVE AND TERMINATE IN A TROUGH TO CATCH THE JUICES OR THEY WILL DROP IN THE FIRE AND SMOKE THE MEAT A GOOD FIRE OF HOT COALS IS NECESSARY
