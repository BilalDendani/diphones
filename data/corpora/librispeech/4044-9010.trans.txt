4044-9010-0000 FOR TWO DAYS THE YOUNG MONK HELD ON PADDLING AND FLOATING RAPIDLY DOWN THE NILE STREAM LEAVING CITY AFTER CITY TO RIGHT AND LEFT WITH LONGING EYES AND LOOKING BACK TO ONE VILLA AFTER ANOTHER TILL THE REACHES OF THE BANKS HID THEM FROM HIS SIGHT
4044-9010-0001 WITH MANY A YEARNING TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF PLACES THOSE GAY BUILDINGS AND GARDENS WOULD LOOK LIKE ON A NEARER VIEW AND WHAT SORT OF LIFE THE THOUSANDS LED WHO CROWDED THE BUSY QUAYS AND WALKED AND DROVE IN AN ENDLESS STREAM ALONG THE GREAT HIGHROADS WHICH RAN ALONG EITHER BANK
4044-9010-0002 HE CAREFULLY AVOIDED EVERY BOAT THAT PASSED HIM FROM THE GILDED BARGE OF THE WEALTHY LANDLORD OR MERCHANT TO THE TINY RAFT BUOYED UP WITH EMPTY JARS WHICH WAS FLOATING DOWN TO BE SOLD AT SOME MARKET IN THE DELTA HERE AND THERE HE MET AND HAILED A CREW OF MONKS
4044-9010-0003 DRAWING THEIR NETS IN A QUIET BAY OR PASSING ALONG THE GREAT WATERY HIGHWAY FROM MONASTERY TO MONASTERY BUT ALL THE NEWS HE RECEIVED FROM THEM WAS THAT THE CANAL OF ALEXANDRIA WAS STILL SEVERAL DAYS JOURNEY BELOW HIM IT SEEMED ENDLESS THAT MONOTONOUS VISTA OF THE TWO HIGH CLAY BANKS
4044-9010-0004 WITH THEIR SLUICES AND WATER WHEELS THEIR KNOTS OF PALMS AND DATE TREES ENDLESS SEEMED THAT WEARISOME SUCCESSION OF BARS OF SAND AND BANKS OF MUD EVERY ONE LIKE THE ONE BEFORE IT EVERY ONE DOTTED WITH THE SAME LINE OF LOGS AND STONES STREWN ALONG THE WATER'S EDGE
4044-9010-0005 WHICH TURNED OUT AS HE APPROACHED THEM TO BE BASKING CROCODILES AND SLEEPING PELICANS HIS EYE WEARIED WITH THE CONTINUAL CONFINEMENT AND WANT OF DISTANCE LONGED FOR THE BOUNDLESS EXPANSE OF THE DESERT FOR THE JAGGED OUTLINES OF THOSE FAR OFF HILLS
4044-9010-0006 WHICH HE HAD WATCHED FROM BOYHOOD RISING MYSTERIOUSLY AT MORN OUT OF THE EASTERN SKY AND MELTING MYSTERIOUSLY INTO IT AGAIN AT EVEN BEYOND WHICH DWELT A WHOLE WORLD OF WONDERS ELEPHANTS AND DRAGONS SATYRS AND ANTHROPOPHAGI AY
4044-9010-0007 TIRED AND MELANCHOLY HIS MIND RETURNED INWARD TO PREY ON ITSELF AND THE LAST WORDS OF ARSENIUS ROSE AGAIN AND AGAIN TO HIS THOUGHTS WAS HIS CALL OF THE SPIRIT OR OF THE FLESH HOW SHOULD HE TEST THAT PROBLEM HE WISHED TO SEETHE WORLD
4044-9010-0008 THAT MIGHT BE CARNAL TRUE BUT HE WISHED TO CONVERT THE WORLD WAS NOT THAT SPIRITUAL WAS HE NOT GOING ON A NOBLE ERRAND THIRSTING FOR TOIL FOR SAINTSHIP FOR MARTYRDOM ITSELF IF IT WOULD BUT COME AND CUT THE GORDIAN KNOT OF ALL TEMPTATIONS
4044-9010-0009 AND SAVE HIM FOR HE DIMLY FELT THAT IT WOULD SAVE HIM A WHOLE SEA OF TROUBLE IN GETTING SAFE AND TRIUMPHANT OUT OF THAT WORLD INTO WHICH HE HAD NOT YET ENTERED AND HIS HEART SHRANK BACK FROM THE UNTRIED HOMELESS WILDERNESS BEFORE HIM BUT NO
4044-9010-0010 THE DIE WAS CAST AND HE MUST DOWN AND ONWARD WHETHER IN OBEDIENCE TO THE SPIRIT OR THE FLESH OH FOR ONE HOUR OF THE QUIET OF THAT DEAR LAURA AND THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES AT LAST
4044-9010-0011 A SUDDEN TURN OF THE BANK BROUGHT HIM IN SIGHT OF A GAUDILY PAINTED BARGE OIL BOARD OF WHICH ARMED MEN IN UNCOUTH AND FOREIGN DRESSES WERE CHASING WITH BARBARIC SHOUTS SOME LARGE OBJECT IN THE WATER IN THE BOWS STOOD A MAN OF GIGANTIC STATURE
4044-9010-0012 BRANDISHING A HARPOON IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND IN HIS LEFT HOLDING THE LINE OF A SECOND THE HEAD OF WHICH WAS FIXED IN THE HUGE PURPLE SIDES OF A HIPPOPOTAMUS WHO FOAMED AND WALLOWED A FEW YARDS DOWN THE STREAM AN OLD GRIZZLED WARRIOR AT THE STERN
4044-9010-0013 WITH A RUDDER IN EITHER HAND KEPT THE BOAT'S HEAD CONTINUALLY TOWARDS THE MONSTER IN SPITE OF ITS SUDDEN AND FRANTIC WHEELINGS AND WHEN IT DASHED MADLY ACROSS THE STREAM
4044-9010-0014 ALL WAS ACTIVITY AND EXCITEMENT AND IT WAS NO WONDER IF PHILAMMON'S CURIOSITY HAD TEMPTED HIM TO DRIFT DOWN ALMOST ABREAST OF THE BARGE ERE HE DESCRIED PEEPING FROM UNDER A DECORATED AWNING IN THE AFTERPART SOME DOZEN PAIRS OF LANGUISHING BLACK EYES
4044-9010-0015 TURNED ALTERNATELY TO THE GAME AND TO HIMSELF THE SERPENTS CHATTERING AND SMILING WITH PRETTY LITTLE SHRIEKS AND SHAKING OF GLOSSY CURLS AND GOLD NECKLACES AND FLUTTERING OF MUSLIN DRESSES WITHIN A DOZEN YARDS OF HIM BLUSHING SCARLET
4044-9010-0016 HE KNEW NOT WHY HE SEIZED HIS PADDLE AND TRIED TO BACK OUT OF THE SNARE BUT SOMEHOW HIS VERY EFFORTS TO ESCAPE THOSE SPARKLING EYES DIVERTED HIS ATTENTION FROM EVERYTHING ELSE THE HIPPOPOTAMUS HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND FURIOUS WITH PAIN
4044-9010-0017 RUSHED STRAIGHT AT THE UNOFFENDING CANOE THE HARPOON LINE BECAME ENTANGLED ROUND HIS BODY
4044-9010-0018 HE AND HIS FRAIL BARK WERE OVERTURNED AND THE MONSTER WITH HIS HUGE WHITE TUSKS GAPING WIDE CLOSE ON HIM AS HE STRUGGLED IN THE STREAM LUCKILY PHILAMMON CONTRARY TO THE WONT OF MONKS WAS A BATHER AND SWAM LIKE A WATER FOWL
4044-9010-0019 FEAR HE HAD NEVER KNOWN DEATH FROM CHILDHOOD HAD BEEN TO HIM AS TO THE OTHER INMATES OF THE LAURA A CONTEMPLATION TOO PERPETUAL TO HAVE ANY PARALYSING TERROR IN IT EVEN THEN WHEN LIFE SEEMED JUST ABOUT TO OPEN ON HIM ANEW BUT THE MONK WAS A MAN
4044-9010-0020 AND A YOUNG ONE AND HAD NO INTENTION OF DYING TAMELY OR UNAVENGED
4044-9010-0021 DRAWN THE SHORT KNIFE WHICH WAS HIS ONLY WEAPON AND DIVING SUDDENLY AVOIDED THE MONSTER'S RUSH AND ATTACKED HIM FROM BEHIND WITH STABS
4044-9010-0022 THE BARBARIANS SHOUTED WITH DELIGHT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS TURNED FURIOUSLY AGAINST HIS NEW ASSAILANT CRUSHING ALAS THE EMPTY CANOE TO FRAGMENTS WITH A SINGLE SNAP OF HIS ENORMOUS JAWS BUT THE TURN WAS FATAL TO HIM
4044-9010-0023 THE BARGE WAS CLOSE UPON HIM AND AS HE PRESENTED HIS BROAD SIDE TO THE BLOW THE SINEWY ARM OF THE GIANT DROVE A HARPOON THROUGH HIS HEART AND WITH ONE CONVULSIVE SHUDDER THE HUGE BLUE MASS TURNED OVER ON ITS SIDE AND FLOATED DEAD POOR PHILAMMON
4044-9010-0024 HE ALONE WAS SILENT AMID THE YELLS OF TRIUMPH SORROWFULLY HE SWAM ROUND AND ROUND HIS LITTLE PAPER WRECK IT WOULD NOT HAVE FLOATED A MOUSE WISTFULLY
4044-9010-0025 HALF MINDED TO STRIKE OUT FOR THEM AND ESCAPE AND THOUGHT OF THE CROCODILES AND PADDLED ROUND AGAIN AND THOUGHT OF THE BASILISK EYES HE MIGHT ESCAPE THE CROCODILES BUT WHO COULD ESCAPE WOMEN AND HE STRUCK OUT VALIANTLY FOR SHORE
4044-9010-0026 WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT TO A SUDDEN STOP BY FINDING THE STEM OF THE BARGE CLOSE ON HIM A NOOSE THROWN OVER HIM BY SOME FRIENDLY BARBARIAN AND HIMSELF HAULED ON BOARD AMID THE LAUGHTER PRAISE ASTONISHMENT AND GRUMBLING OF THE GOOD NATURED CREW
4044-9010-0027 TO AVAIL HIMSELF AT ONCE OF THEIR HELP AND COULD NOT CONCEIVE THE CAUSE OF HIS RELUCTANCE PHILAMMON GAZED WITH WONDER ON HIS STRANGE HOSTS THEIR PALE COMPLEXIONS GLOBULAR HEADS AND FACES HIGH CHEEK BONES TALL AND STURDY FIGURES

4044-9010-0029 BROOCHES AND ROMAN COINS STRUNG LIKE NECKLACES ONLY THE STEERSMAN WHO HAD COME FORWARD TO WONDER AT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AND TO HELP IN DRAGGING THE UNWIELDY BRUTE ON BOARD SEEMED TO KEEP GENUINE AND UNORNAMENTED THE COSTUME OF HIS RACE THE WHITE LINEN LEGGINGS
4044-9010-0030 THE BEARS' FUR CLOAK THE ONLY ORNAMENTS OF WHICH WERE THE FANGS AND CLAWS OF THE BEAST ITSELF AND A FRINGE OF GRIZZLED TUFTS WHICH LOOKED BUT TOO LIKE HUMAN HAIR THE LANGUAGE WHICH THEY SPOKE WAS UTTERLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO PHILAMMON

4044-9010-0084 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE PHILAMMON FELT A HOSTILE GRIPE UPON HIM AND A NEW SENSATION RUSHED THROUGH EVERY NERVE AS HE GRAPPLED WITH THE WARRIOR CLUTCHED WITH HIS LEFT HAND THE UP LIFTED WRIST AND WITH HIS RIGHT THE GIRDLE AND COMMENCED WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE AIM
4044-9010-0085 A FIERCE STRUGGLE WHICH STRANGE TO SAY AS IT WENT ON GREW ABSOLUTELY PLEASANT THE WOMEN SHRIEKED TO THEIR LOVERS TO PART THE COMBATANTS BUT IN VAIN NOT FOR WORLDS A VERY FAIR MATCH AND A VERY FAIR FIGHT
4044-9010-0086 THAT'S RIGHT MY SMID DON'T USE THE KNIFE THEY WILL BE OVERBOARD IN A MOMENT
4044-9010-0087 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF IT AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT PHILAMMON WOULD HAVE WRENCHED THE BILL OUT OF HIS OPPONENT'S HAND WHEN TO THE UTTER ASTONISHMENT OF THE ONLOOKERS HE SUDDENLY LOOSED HIS HOLD SHOOK HIMSELF FREE BY ONE POWERFUL WRENCH AND QUIETLY RETREATED TO HIS SEAT
4044-9010-0088 THE ONLOOKERS WERE STRUCK DUMB WITH ASTONISHMENT THEY HAD TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT HE WOULD AS A MATTER OF COURSE HAVE USED HIS RIGHT OF SPLITTING HIS VANQUISHED OPPONENT'S SKULL AN EVENT WHICH THEY WOULD OF COURSE HAVE DEEPLY DEPLORED
4044-9010-0089 CARVING HIM INTO THE BLOOD EAGLE
4044-9010-0090 SMID ROSE WITH A BILL IN HIS HAND AND LOOKED ROUND HIM PERHAPS TO SEE WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM HE HALF LIFTED HIS WEAPON TO STRIKE PHILAMMON SEATED LOOKED HIM CALMLY IN THE FACE THE OLD WARRIOR'S EYE CAUGHT THE BANK
4044-9010-0091 WHICH WAS NOW RECEDING RAPIDLY PAST THEM AND WHEN HE SAW THAT THEY WERE REALLY FLOATING DOWNWARDS AGAIN WITHOUT AN EFFORT TO STEM THE STREAM HE PUT AWAY HIS BILL AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN DELIBERATELY IN HIS PLACE ASTONISHING THE ONLOOKERS QUITE AS MUCH AS PHILAMMON HAD DONE
4044-9010-0092 FIVE MINUTES GOOD FIGHTING AND NO ONE KILLED
4044-9010-0093 AND THEREWITH HE RUSHED ON POOR PHILAMMON HE SPOKE THE HEART OF THE CREW THE SLEEPING WOLF IN THEM HAD BEEN AWAKENED BY THE STRUGGLE AND BLOOD THEY WOULD HAVE AND NOT FRANTICALLY LIKE CELTS OR EGYPTIANS BUT WITH THE COOL HUMOROUS CRUELTY OF THE TEUTON
4044-9010-0094 THEY ROSE ALTOGETHER AND TURNING PHILAMMON OVER ON HIS BACK DELIBERATED BY WHAT DEATH HE SHOULD DIE PHILAMMON QUIETLY SUBMITTED IF SUBMISSION HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT STATE OF MIND IN WHICH SHEER ASTONISHMENT AND NOVELTY HAVE BROKEN UP ALL THE CUSTOM OF MAN'S NATURE
4044-9010-0095 TILL THE STRANGEST DEEDS AND SUFFERINGS ARE TAKEN AS MATTERS OF COURSE HIS SUDDEN ESCAPE FROM THE LAURA THE NEW WORLD OF THOUGHT AND ACTION
4044-9010-0096 THE NEW COMPANIONS WITH WHOM HE HAD FALLEN IN HAD DRIVEN HIM UTTERLY FROM HIS MOORINGS AND NOW ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO HIM HE WHO HAD PROMISED NEVER TO LOOK UPON WOMAN FOUND HIMSELF BY CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH HE HAD NO CONTROL
4044-9010-0097 AMID A BOATFUL OF THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE SPECIES OF THAT MOST OBJECTIONABLE GENUS AND THE UTTERLY WORST HAVING HAPPENED EVERYTHING ELSE WHICH HAPPENED MUST BE BETTER THAN THE WORST FOR THE REST HE HAD GONE FORTH TO SEE THE WORLD
4044-9010-0098 AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE WAYS OF IT SO HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEE IT AND BE FILLED WITH THE FRUIT OF HIS OWN DEVICES AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CERTAINLY FILLED WITH THE SAME IN FIVE MINUTES MORE IN SOME SHAPE TOO UGLY TO BE MENTIONED BUT
4044-9010-0099 AS EVEN SINFUL WOMEN HAVE HEARTS IN THEM PELAGIA SHRIEKED OUT
4044-9010-0100 THE WARRIORS ARE FREE MEN MY DARLING AND KNOW WHAT IS PROPER AND WHAT CAN THE LIFE OF SUCH A BRUTE BE TO YOU

4044-9010-0103 THE GOTHS DREW BACK FOR PELAGIA HERSELF THEY HAD AS LITTLE RESPECT AS THE REST OF THE WORLD HAD BUT FOR A MOMENT SHE WAS NOT THE MESSALINA OF ALEXANDRIA BUT A WOMAN AND TRUE TO THE OLD WOMAN WORSHIPPING INSTINCT
4044-9010-0104 THEY LOOKED ONE AND ALL AT HER FLASHING EYES FULL OF NOBLE PITY AND INDIGNATION AS WELL AS OF MERE WOMAN'S TERROR AND DREW BACK AND WHISPERED TOGETHER WHETHER THE GOOD SPIRIT OR THE EVIL ONE WOULD CONQUER SEEMED FOR A MOMENT DOUBTFUL
4044-9010-0105 WHEN PELAGIA FELT A HEAVY HAND ON HER SHOULDER AND TURNING SAW WULF THE SON OF OVIDA GO BACK PRETTY WOMAN MEN I CLAIM THE BOY SMID GIVE HIM TO ME

4044-9010-0108 NOT UNDERSTANDING THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH HE WAS ADDRESSED COULD ONLY SHAKE HIS HEAD THOUGH IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT ITS IMPORT WAS HE COULD HARDLY IN HONESTY HAVE SAID NO HE SHAKES HIS HEAD HE DOES NOT LIKE IT
4044-9010-0109 I HAD KILLED KINGS WHEN YOU WERE SHOOTING FROGS CRIED SMID LISTEN TO ME MY SONS A COWARD GRIPS SHARPLY AT FIRST AND LOOSENS HIS HAND AFTER A WHILE BECAUSE HIS BLOOD IS SOON HOT AND SOON COLD A BRAVE MAN'S GRIP
4044-9010-0110 THE LONGER HE HOLDS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF ODIN COMES UPON HIM I WATCHED THE BOY'S HANDS ON MY THREAT AND HE WILL MAKE A MAN AND I WILL MAKE HIM ONE HOWEVER WE MAY AS WELL MAKE HIM USEFUL AT ONCE SO GIVE HIM AN OAR WELL ANSWERED HIS NEW PROTECTOR
4044-9010-0111 THE QUICKER WE GO THE BETTER AND AS THE MEN SETTLED THEMSELVES AGAIN TO THEIR OARS ONE WAS PUT INTO PHILAMMON'S HAND WHICH HE MANAGED WITH SUCH STRENGTH AND SKILL THAT HIS LATE TORMENTORS WHO IN SPITE OF AN OCCASIONAL INCLINATION TO ROBBERY AND MURDER
4044-9010-0112 WERE THOROUGHLY GOOD NATURED HONEST FELLOWS
4044-9010-0113 AND THEN WENT FORWARD AS MANY OF THEM AS WERE NOT ROWING
4044-9010-0114 PAWING HIM OVER FROM TUSKS TO TAIL
