3132-167590-0000 WELL ARE YOU SATISFIED NOW SAID HE YOU'VE MADE ME QUARREL WITH MY SON SATISFIED
3132-167590-0001 SATISFIED IT HURTS ME IT HURTS I'M OLD AND WEAK AND THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED WELL THEN GLOAT OVER IT GLOAT OVER IT AFTER THAT PRINCESS MARY DID NOT SEE HER FATHER
3132-167590-0002 AND DID NOT LEAVE HIS STUDY PRINCESS MARY NOTICED TO HER SURPRISE THAT DURING THIS ILLNESS THE OLD PRINCE NOT ONLY EXCLUDED HER FROM HIS ROOM BUT DID NOT
3132-167590-0003 ADMIT MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE EITHER TIKHON ALONE ATTENDED HIM AT THE END OF THE WEEK THE PRINCE REAPPEARED AND RESUMED HIS FORMER WAY OF LIFE DEVOTING HIMSELF
3132-167590-0004 WITH SPECIAL ACTIVITY TO BUILDING OPERATIONS AND THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE GARDENS AND COMPLETELY BREAKING OFF
3132-167590-0005 MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE HIS LOOKS AND COLD TONE TO HIS DAUGHTER SEEMED TO SAY THERE YOU SEE
3132-167590-0006 AGAINST ME YOU LIED TO PRINCE ANDREW ABOUT MY RELATIONS WITH THAT FRENCHWOMAN AND MADE ME QUARREL WITH HIM BUT YOU SEE I NEED NEITHER HER NOR YOU
3132-167590-0007 PRINCESS MARY SPENT HALF OF EVERY DAY WITH LITTLE NICHOLAS WATCHING HIS LESSONS TEACHING HIM RUSSIAN AND MUSIC HERSELF AND
3132-167590-0008 SHE SPENT OVER HER BOOKS WITH HER OLD NURSE OR WITH GOD'S FOLK
3132-167590-0009 OF THE WAR PRINCESS MARY THOUGHT AS WOMEN DO THINK ABOUT WARS SHE FEARED FOR HER BROTHER WHO WAS IN IT WAS HORRIFIED BY AND AMAZED
3132-167590-0010 AT THE STRANGE CRUELTY THAT IMPELS MEN TO KILL ONE ANOTHER BUT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WAR WHICH SEEMED TO HER LIKE ALL PREVIOUS WARS
3132-167590-0011 SHE DID NOT REALIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WAR THOUGH DESSALLES WITH WHOM SHE CONSTANTLY CONVERSED WAS PASSIONATELY INTERESTED IN ITS PROGRESS
3132-167590-0012 AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN HIS OWN CONCEPTION OF IT TO HER AND THOUGH THE GOD'S FOLK WHO CAME TO SEE HER REPORTED IN THEIR OWN WAY THE RUMORS CURRENT AMONG THE PEOPLE
3132-167590-0013 THOUGH JULIE NOW PRINCESS DRUBETSKAYA WHO HAD RESUMED CORRESPONDENCE WITH HER WROTE PATRIOTIC LETTERS FROM MOSCOW I WRITE YOU IN RUSSIAN MY GOOD FRIEND
3132-167590-0014 WROTE JULIE IN HER FRENCHIFIED RUSSIAN BECAUSE I HAVE A DETESTATION
3132-167590-0015 AND THE SAME FOR THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH I CANNOT SUPPORT TO HEAR SPOKEN WE IN MOSCOW ARE ELATED BY ENTHUSIASM FOR OUR ADORED EMPEROR
3132-167590-0016 MY POOR HUSBAND IS ENDURING PAINS
3132-167590-0017 WHICH I HAVE INSPIRES ME YET MORE YOU HEARD
3132-167590-0018 RAEVSKI EMBRACING HIS TWO SONS AND SAYING I WILL PERISH WITH THEM BUT WE WILL NOT BE SHAKEN AND TRULY
3132-167590-0019 TWICE STRONGER THAN WE WE WERE UNSHAKABLE WE PASS THE TIME AS WE CAN BUT IN WAR AS IN WAR
3132-167590-0020 SIT WHOLE DAYS WITH ME AND WE UNHAPPY WIDOWS OF LIVE MEN MAKE BEAUTIFUL CONVERSATIONS OVER OUR CHARPIE
3132-167590-0021 ARE MISSING AND SO ON THE CHIEF REASON PRINCESS MARY DID NOT REALIZE THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WAR WAS THAT THE OLD PRINCE NEVER SPOKE OF IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE IT
3132-167590-0022 AND LAUGHED AT DESSALLES WHEN HE MENTIONED IT AT DINNER THE PRINCE'S TONE WAS SO CALM AND CONFIDENT THAT PRINCESS MARY UNHESITATINGLY BELIEVED HIM
3132-167590-0023 ALL THAT JULY THE OLD PRINCE WAS EXCEEDINGLY ACTIVE AND EVEN ANIMATED
3132-167590-0024 DOMESTIC SERFS THE ONLY THING THAT MADE PRINCESS MARY ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM WAS THAT HE SLEPT VERY LITTLE AND INSTEAD OF SLEEPING IN HIS STUDY AS USUAL CHANGED HIS
3132-167590-0025 SLEEPING PLACE EVERY DAY ONE DAY HE WOULD ORDER HIS CAMP BED TO BE SET UP IN THE GLASS GALLERY ANOTHER DAY
3132-167590-0026 OR ON THE LOUNGE CHAIR IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND DOZED THERE WITHOUT UNDRESSING WHILE INSTEAD OF MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE A SERF BOY READ TO HIM
3132-167590-0027 THEN AGAIN HE WOULD SPEND A NIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM ON AUGUST FIRST A SECOND LETTER WAS RECEIVED FROM PRINCE ANDREW IN HIS FIRST LETTER WHICH CAME SOON AFTER HE HAD LEFT HOME
3132-167590-0028 PRINCE ANDREW HAD DUTIFULLY ASKED HIS FATHER'S FORGIVENESS FOR WHAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO SAY AND BEGGED TO BE
3132-167590-0029 TO HIS FAVOR TO THIS LETTER THE OLD PRINCE HAD REPLIED AFFECTIONATELY AND FROM THAT TIME HAD KEPT THE FRENCHWOMAN AT A DISTANCE PRINCE ANDREW'S SECOND LETTER
3132-167590-0030 WRITTEN NEAR VITEBSK AFTER THE FRENCH HAD OCCUPIED THAT TOWN GAVE A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN ENCLOSED FOR THEM A PLAN HE HAD DRAWN AND
3132-167590-0031 FORECASTS AS TO THE FURTHER PROGRESS OF THE WAR IN THIS LETTER PRINCE ANDREW POINTED OUT TO HIS FATHER THE DANGER OF STAYING AT BALD HILLS SO NEAR THE THEATER OF WAR
3132-167590-0032 AND ON THE ARMY'S DIRECT LINE OF MARCH AND ADVISED HIM TO MOVE TO MOSCOW AT DINNER THAT DAY ON DESSALLES MENTIONING THAT THE FRENCH WERE SAID TO HAVE ALREADY
3132-167590-0033 THE OLD PRINCE REMEMBERED HIS SON'S LETTER THERE WAS A LETTER FROM PRINCE ANDREW TODAY HE SAID TO PRINCESS MARY HAVEN'T YOU READ IT NO FATHER SHE REPLIED IN A FRIGHTENED VOICE
3132-167590-0034 SHE COULD NOT HAVE READ THE LETTER AS SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW IT HAD ARRIVED HE WRITES ABOUT THIS WAR SAID THE PRINCE
3132-167590-0035 IN SPEAKING OF THE PRESENT WAR
3132-167590-0036 OH VERY INTERESTING SAID MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE GO AND GET IT FOR ME SAID THE OLD PRINCE TO MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE YOU KNOW UNDER THE PAPERWEIGHT ON THE LITTLE TABLE
3132-167590-0037 MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE JUMPED UP EAGERLY
3132-167590-0038 AND WENT TO THE STUDY BUT AS SOON AS HE HAD LEFT THE ROOM THE OLD PRINCE LOOKING UNEASILY ROUND THREW DOWN HIS NAPKIN AND WENT HIMSELF THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING
3132-167590-0039 ALWAYS MAKE SOME MUDDLE HE MUTTERED WHILE HE WAS AWAY PRINCESS MARY DESSALLES MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE AND EVEN LITTLE NICHOLAS EXCHANGED LOOKS IN SILENCE
3132-167590-0040 THE OLD PRINCE RETURNED WITH QUICK STEPS ACCOMPANIED BY MICHAEL
3132-167590-0041 BRINGING THE LETTER AND A PLAN THESE HE PUT DOWN BESIDE HIM NOT LETTING ANYONE READ THEM AT DINNER ON MOVING TO THE DRAWING ROOM HE HANDED THE LETTER TO PRINCESS MARY AND
3132-167590-0042 SPREADING OUT BEFORE HIM THE PLAN OF THE NEW BUILDING AND FIXING HIS EYES UPON IT TOLD HER TO READ THE LETTER ALOUD WHEN SHE HAD DONE SO PRINCESS MARY LOOKED INQUIRINGLY
3132-167590-0043 AT HER FATHER HE WAS EXAMINING THE PLAN EVIDENTLY ENGROSSED IN HIS OWN IDEAS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT PRINCE
3132-167590-0044 SAID THE PRINCE AS IF UNPLEASANTLY AWAKENED
3132-167590-0045 VERY POSSIBLY
3132-167590-0046 HA HA HA THE THEATER OF WAR SAID THE PRINCE I HAVE SAID AND STILL SAY THAT
3132-167590-0047 NIEMEN DESSALLES LOOKED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE PRINCE WHO WAS TALKING OF THE NIEMEN WHEN THE ENEMY WAS ALREADY AT THE
3132-167590-0048 BUT PRINCESS MARY FORGETTING
3132-167590-0049 WHEN THE SNOW MELTS THEY'LL SINK IN THE POLISH SWAMPS ONLY THEY COULD FAIL TO SEE IT THE PRINCE CONTINUED EVIDENTLY THINKING OF THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN O SEVEN WHICH
3132-167590-0050 SEEMED TO HIM SO RECENT BENNIGSEN SHOULD HAVE ADVANCED INTO PRUSSIA SOONER THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT TURN BUT PRINCE DESSALLES BEGAN TIMIDLY
3132-167590-0051 THE LETTER MENTIONS VITEBSK AH THE LETTER YES REPLIED THE PRINCE PEEVISHLY YES YES HIS FACE SUDDENLY
3132-167590-0052 TOOK ON A MOROSE EXPRESSION HE PAUSED YES HE WRITES THAT THE FRENCH WERE BEATEN AT AT WHAT RIVER IS IT
3132-167590-0053 DESSALLES DROPPED HIS EYES THE PRINCE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THAT HE REMARKED GENTLY DOESN'T HE BUT I DIDN'T INVENT IT MYSELF NO ONE SPOKE
3132-167590-0054 FOR A LONG TIME YES YES WELL
3132-167590-0055 HE SUDDENLY WENT ON RAISING HIS HEAD AND POINTING TO THE PLAN OF THE BUILDING TELL ME HOW YOU MEAN TO ALTER IT
3132-167590-0056 AND THE PRINCE AFTER SPEAKING TO HIM ABOUT THE BUILDING LOOKED ANGRILY AT PRINCESS MARY
3132-167590-0057 AND WENT TO HIS OWN ROOM PRINCESS MARY
3132-167590-0058 AND ASTONISHED LOOK FIXED ON HER FATHER NOTICED HIS SILENCE AND WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT HER FATHER HAD FORGOTTEN HIS SON'S LETTER ON THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE
3132-167590-0059 BUT SHE WAS NOT ONLY AFRAID TO SPEAK OF IT
3132-167590-0060 THE REASON OF HIS CONFUSION AND SILENCE BUT WAS AFRAID EVEN TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THE EVENING
3132-167590-0061 SENT BY THE PRINCE CAME TO PRINCESS MARY FOR PRINCE ANDREW'S LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE GAVE IT TO HIM AND UNPLEASANT AS IT WAS TO HER TO DO SO
3132-167590-0062 VENTURED TO ASK HIM WHAT HER FATHER WAS DOING ALWAYS BUSY REPLIED MICHAEL IVANOVICH WITH A RESPECTFULLY IRONIC SMILE WHICH CAUSED PRINCESS MARY TO TURN PALE
3132-167590-0063 HE'S WORRYING VERY MUCH ABOUT THE NEW BUILDING HE HAS BEEN READING A LITTLE BUT NOW
3132-167590-0064 LOWERING HIS VOICE NOW HE'S AT HIS DESK BUSY WITH HIS WILL I EXPECT
3132-167590-0065 ONE OF THE PRINCE'S FAVORITE OCCUPATIONS OF LATE HAD BEEN THE PREPARATION OF SOME PAPERS HE MEANT TO LEAVE AT HIS DEATH AND WHICH HE CALLED HIS WILL
3132-167590-0066 SMOLENSK ASKED PRINCESS MARY
