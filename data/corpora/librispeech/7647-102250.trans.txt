7647-102250-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THE DRIFT OF POLITICS THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE MADE THE SLAVERY QUESTION PARAMOUNT IN EVERY STATE OF THE UNION
7647-102250-0001 THE BOASTED FINALITY WAS A BROKEN REED THE LIFE BOAT OF COMPROMISE A HOPELESS WRECK IF THE AGREEMENT OF A GENERATION COULD BE THUS ANNULLED IN A BREATH WAS THERE ANY SAFETY EVEN IN THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF
7647-102250-0002 THIS FEELING COMMUNICATED ITSELF TO THE NORTHERN STATES AT THE VERY FIRST NOTE OF WARNING AND EVERY MAN'S PARTY FEALTY WAS AT ONCE DECIDED BY HIS TOLERATION OF OR OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY
7647-102250-0003 WHILE THE FATE OF THE NEBRASKA BILL HUNG IN A DOUBTFUL BALANCE IN THE HOUSE THE FEELING FOUND EXPRESSION IN LETTERS SPEECHES MEETINGS PETITIONS AND REMONSTRANCES
7647-102250-0004 EVERY OTHER POLITICAL SUBJECT WAS LEFT IN ABEYANCE THE MEASURE ONCE PASSED AND THE COMPROMISE REPEALED THE FIRST NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO COMBINE ORGANIZE AND AGITATE FOR ITS RESTORATION
7647-102250-0005 THIS WAS THE READY MADE COMMON GROUND OF COOPERATION IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS MERELY DEFENSIVE ENERGY WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERCOME AND DISSIPATED
7647-102250-0006 HAD IT NOT AT THIS JUNCTURE BEEN INSPIRITED AND LED BY THE FACTION KNOWN AS THE FREE SOIL PARTY OF THE COUNTRY COMPOSED MAINLY OF MEN OF INDEPENDENT ANTI SLAVERY VIEWS
7647-102250-0007 WHO HAD DURING FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS BEEN ORGANIZED AS A DISTINCT POLITICAL BODY WITH NO NEAR HOPE OF SUCCESS BUT ANIMATED MAINLY BY THE DESIRE TO GIVE EXPRESSION TO THEIR DEEP
7647-102250-0008 PERSONAL CONVICTIONS IF THERE WERE DEMAGOGUES HERE AND THERE AMONG THEM SEEKING MERELY TO CREATE A BALANCE OF POWER FOR BARGAIN AND SALE THEY WERE UNIMPORTANT IN NUMBER
7647-102250-0009 AND ONLY OF LOCAL INFLUENCE AND SOON BECAME DESERTERS THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE EARNESTNESS OF THE BODY OF THIS FACTION
7647-102250-0010 A FEW FANATICAL MEN WHO HAD MADE IT THE VEHICLE OF VIOLENT EXPRESSIONS HAD KEPT IT UNDER THE BAN OF POPULAR PREJUDICE IT HAD LONG BEEN HELD UP TO PUBLIC ODIUM
7647-102250-0011 ABOLITIONISTS MOST OF THE ABOLITIONISTS WERE DOUBTLESS IN THIS PARTY BUT THE PARTY WAS NOT ALL COMPOSED OF ABOLITIONISTS DESPITE OBJURGATION AND CONTEMPT IT HAD BECOME SINCE EIGHTEEN FORTY
7647-102250-0012 A CONSTANT AND GROWING FACTOR IN POLITICS IT HAD OPERATED AS A NEGATIVE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE LAST THREE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS CAUSING BY ITS DIVERSION OF VOTES AND MORE ESPECIALLY
7647-102250-0013 BY ITS RELAXING INFLUENCE UPON PARTIES THE SUCCESS OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE JAMES K POLK IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR THE WHIG CANDIDATE GENERAL TAYLOR IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT
7647-102250-0014 IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO THIS SMALL PARTY OF ANTISLAVERY VETERANS OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND VOTERS IN THE AGGREGATE AND DISTRIBUTED IN DETACHMENTS OF FROM THREE THOUSAND
7647-102250-0015 TO THIRTY THOUSAND IN TWELVE OF THE FREE STATES NOW CAME TO THE FRONT AND WITH ITS NEWSPAPERS AND SPEAKERS TRAINED IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE SUBJECT AND ITS COMMITTEES AND AFFILIATIONS
7647-102250-0016 ALREADY IN ACTION AND CORRESPONDENCE BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT AGAINST THE REPEAL HITHERTO ITS AIMS HAD APPEARED UTOPIAN AND ITS RESOLVES HAD BEEN DENUNCIATORY AND EXASPERATING
7647-102250-0017 NOW COMBINING WISDOM WITH OPPORTUNITY IT BECAME CONCILIATORY AND ABATING SOMETHING OF ITS ABSTRACTIONS MADE ITSELF THE EXPONENT OF A DEMAND FOR A PRESENT
7647-102250-0018 AND PRACTICAL REFORM A SIMPLE RETURN TO THE ANCIENT FAITH AND LANDMARKS IT LABORED SPECIALLY TO BRING ABOUT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE OLD PARTY ORGANIZATIONS AND THE FORMATION OF A NEW ONE
7647-102250-0019 BASED UPON THE GENERAL POLICY OF RESISTING THE EXTENSION OF SLAVERY SINCE HOWEVER THE REPEAL HAD SHAKEN BUT NOT OBLITERATED OLD PARTY LINES
7647-102250-0020 THIS EFFORT SUCCEEDED ONLY IN FAVORABLE LOCALITIES ILLUSTRATION HISTORICAL MAP OF THE UNITED STATES IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR
7647-102250-0021 THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO PREVIOUS TO EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT IS INDICATED THUS PLUS PLUS PLUS FOR THE PRESENT
7647-102250-0022 PARTY DISINTEGRATION WAS SLOW MEN WERE RELUCTANT TO ABANDON THEIR OLD TIME PRINCIPLES AND ASSOCIATIONS THE UNITED EFFORTS OF DOUGLAS AND THE ADMINISTRATION HELD THE BODY OF THE NORTHERN DEMOCRATS TO HIS FATAL POLICY
7647-102250-0023 THOUGH PROTESTS AND DEFECTIONS BECAME ALARMINGLY FREQUENT ON THE OTHER HAND THE GREAT MASS OF NORTHERN WHIGS PROMPTLY OPPOSED THE REPEAL AND FORMED THE BULK OF THE OPPOSITION
7647-102250-0024 NEVERTHELESS LOSING PERHAPS AS MANY PRO SLAVERY WHIGS AS THEY GAINED ANTISLAVERY DEMOCRATS THE REAL AND EFFECTIVE GAIN THEREFORE WAS THE MORE OR LESS THOROUGH ALLIANCE OF THE WHIG PARTY
7647-102250-0025 AND THE FREE SOIL PARTY OF THE NORTHERN STATES WHEREVER THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL IT GAVE IMMEDIATE AND AVAILABLE MAJORITIES TO THE OPPOSITION WHICH MADE THEIR INFLUENCE FELT EVEN IN THE VERY OPENING OF THE POPULAR CONTEST
7647-102250-0026 FOLLOWING THE CONGRESSIONAL REPEAL IT HAPPENED THAT THIS WAS A YEAR FOR ELECTING CONGRESSMEN THE NEBRASKA BILL DID NOT PASS TILL THE END OF MAY AND THE POLITICAL EXCITEMENT WAS AT ONCE TRANSFERRED FROM WASHINGTON
7647-102250-0027 TO EVERY DISTRICT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY IT MAY BE SAID WITH TRUTH THAT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR FORMED ONE CONTINUOUS AND SOLID POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FROM JANUARY TO NOVEMBER
7647-102250-0028 RISING IN INTEREST AND EARNESTNESS FROM FIRST TO LAST AND ENGAGING IN THE DISCUSSION MORE FULLY THAN HAD EVER OCCURRED IN PREVIOUS AMERICAN HISTORY ALL THE CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF OUR POPULATION
7647-102250-0029 IN THE SOUTHERN STATES THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WELCOMED SUPPORTED AND DEFENDED THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
7647-102250-0030 AND APPARENTLY FAVORABLE TO THEIR PRO SLAVERY INTERESTS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE SOUTH
7647-102250-0031 WAS OF COURSE A UNIT IN ITS FAVOR THE WHIG PARTY HOWEVER HAVING CARRIED TWO SLAVE STATES FOR SCOTT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO AND HOLDING A STRONG MINORITY IN THE REMAINDER
7647-102250-0032 WAS NOT SO UNANIMOUS SEVEN SOUTHERN REPRESENTATIVES AND TWO SOUTHERN SENATORS HAD VOTED AGAINST THE NEBRASKA BILL AND MANY INDIVIDUAL VOTERS CONDEMNED IT AS AN ACT OF BAD FAITH
7647-102250-0033 AS THE ABANDONMENT OF THE ACCEPTED FINALITY AND AS THE PROVOCATION OF A DANGEROUS ANTISLAVERY REACTION BUT PUBLIC OPINION IN THAT PART OF THE UNION WAS FEARFULLY TYRANNICAL
7647-102250-0034 AND INTOLERANT AND OPPOSITION DARED ONLY TO MANIFEST ITSELF TO DEMOCRATIC PARTY ORGANIZATION NOT TO THESE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEASURES
7647-102250-0035 THE WHIGS OF THE SOUTH WERE THEREFORE DRIVEN PRECIPITATELY TO DIVISION THOSE OF EXTREME PRO SLAVERY VIEWS LIKE DIXON OF KENTUCKY WHO WHEN HE INTRODUCED HIS AMENDMENT DECLARED
7647-102250-0036 UPON THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY I KNOW NO WHIGGERY AND NO DEMOCRACY WENT BOLDLY AND AT ONCE OVER INTO THE DEMOCRATIC CAMP
7647-102250-0037 WERE SUNDERED FROM THEIR ANCIENT ALLIES IN THE NORTHERN STATES BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF TAKING UP THE LATTER'S ANTISLAVERY WAR CRY AT THIS JUNCTURE
7647-102250-0038 THE POLITICAL SITUATION WAS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE SUDDEN RISE OF AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR IN POLITICS THE AMERICAN PARTY
7647-102250-0039 KNOW NOTHINGS ESSENTIALLY IT WAS A REVIVAL OF THE EXTINCT NATIVE AMERICAN FACTION BASED UPON A JEALOUSY OF AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FOREIGN BORN VOTERS
7647-102250-0040 DESIRING AN EXTENSION OF THEIR PERIOD OF NATURALIZATION AND THEIR EXCLUSION FROM OFFICE ALSO BASED UPON A CERTAIN HOSTILITY TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC RELIGION IT HAD BEEN REORGANIZED AS A SECRET ORDER
7647-102250-0041 IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND SEIZING UPON THE POLITICAL DISAPPOINTMENTS FOLLOWING GENERAL SCOTT'S OVERWHELMING DEFEAT FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO
7647-102250-0042 AND PROFITING BY THE DISINTEGRATION CAUSED BY THE NEBRASKA BILL IT RAPIDLY GAINED RECRUITS BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH OPERATING IN ENTIRE SECRECY
7647-102250-0043 THE COUNTRY WAS STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE IN ONE LOCALITY AFTER ANOTHER ON ELECTION DAY OF A POTENT AND UNSUSPECTED POLITICAL POWER WHICH IN MANY INSTANCES PUSHED BOTH THE OLD ORGANIZATIONS NOT ONLY TO DISASTROUS
7647-102250-0044 BUT EVEN TO RIDICULOUS DEFEAT BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH ITS FORCES WERE RECRUITED MAINLY FROM THE WHIG PARTY THOUGH MALCONTENTS FROM ALL QUARTERS RUSHED TO GROUP THEMSELVES UPON ITS NARROW PLATFORM
7647-102250-0045 AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXCITING BUT DELUSIVE TRIUMPHS OF ITS TEMPORARY AND LOCAL ASCENDENCY WHEN IN THE OPENING OF THE ANTI NEBRASKA CONTEST
7647-102250-0046 THEY HAD BECAUSE OF THEIR GENERALLY DEMOCRATIC ANTECEDENTS WITH GREAT UNANIMITY
7647-102250-0047 REPUBLICAN PARTY THUS REVIVING THE DISTINCTIVE APPELLATION BY WHICH THE FOLLOWERS OF JEFFERSON WERE KNOWN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE REPUBLIC
7647-102250-0048 IN HIS DRAFT OF THE ORDINANCE OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE NAME BECAME SINGULARLY APPROPRIATE AND WHEREVER THE FREE SOILERS SUCCEEDED IN FORMING A COALITION IT WAS ADOPTED WITHOUT QUESTION
7647-102250-0049 BUT THE REFUSAL OF THE WHIGS IN MANY STATES TO SURRENDER THEIR NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND MORE ESPECIALLY THE ABRUPT APPEARANCE OF THE KNOW NOTHINGS ON THE FIELD OF PARTIES RETARDED THE GENERAL COALITION
7647-102250-0050 BETWEEN THE WHIGS AND THE FREE SOILERS WHICH SO MANY INFLUENCES FAVORED AS IT TURNED OUT A GREAT VARIETY OF PARTY NAMES WERE RETAINED OR ADOPTED IN THE CONGRESSIONAL AND STATE CAMPAIGNS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR
7647-102250-0051 THE DESIGNATION OF ANTI NEBRASKA BEING PERHAPS THE MOST COMMON AND CERTAINLY FOR THE MOMENT THE MOST SERVICEABLE SINCE DENUNCIATION OF THE NEBRASKA BILL
7647-102250-0052 WAS THE ONE ALL PERVADING BOND OF SYMPATHY AND AGREEMENT
7647-102250-0053 ON ALMOST ALL OTHER POLITICAL TOPICS THIS AFFILIATION HOWEVER WAS CONFINED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE FREE STATES IN THE SLAVE STATES
7647-102250-0054 AND IT WAS NOT ONLY INCLINED BUT FORCED TO MAKE ITS BATTLE EITHER UNDER THE OLD NAME OF WHIGS OR AS BECAME MORE POPULAR UNDER THE NEW APPELLATION OF AMERICANS WHICH GREW INTO A MORE
7647-102250-0055 DIGNIFIED SYNONYM FOR KNOW NOTHINGS THUS CONFRONTED THE NEBRASKA AND ANTI NEBRASKA FACTIONS OR MORE PHILOSOPHICALLY SPEAKING THE PRO SLAVERY AND ANTISLAVERY SENTIMENT
7647-102250-0056 OF THE SEVERAL AMERICAN STATES BATTLED FOR POLITICAL SUPREMACY WITH A ZEAL AND DETERMINATION ONLY MANIFESTED ON OCCASIONS OF DEEP AND VITAL CONCERN TO THE WELFARE OF THE REPUBLIC
7647-102250-0057 THEY DO NOT SHRINK FROM IT WHEN THEY HEAR WARNING OF REAL DANGER THE ALARM OF THE NATION ON THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE WAS SERIOUS AND STARTLING ALL RANKS AND OCCUPATIONS
7647-102250-0058 THEREFORE JOINED WITH A NEW ENERGY IN THE CONTEST IT PROVOKED PARTICULARLY WAS THE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT OF THE NORTH PROFOUNDLY MOVED BY THE MORAL QUESTION INVOLVED
7647-102250-0059 PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR MODERN POLITICS THE PULPIT VIED WITH THE PRESS
7647-102250-0060 IN THE WORK OF DEBATE AND PROPAGANDISM THE VERY INCEPTION OF THE STRUGGLE HAD PROVOKED BITTER WORDS BEFORE THE THIRD NEBRASKA BILL HAD YET BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE SENATE
7647-102250-0061 THE THEN LITTLE BAND OF FREE SOILERS IN CONGRESS CHASE SUMNER GIDDINGS AND THREE OTHERS HAD ISSUED A NEWSPAPER ADDRESS CALLING THE REPEAL
7647-102250-0062 A GROSS VIOLATION OF A SACRED PLEDGE A CRIMINAL BETRAYAL OF PRECIOUS RIGHTS AN ATROCIOUS PLOT DESIGNED TO COVER UP FROM PUBLIC REPREHENSION
7647-102250-0063 ET CETERA DOUGLAS SEIZING ONLY TOO GLADLY THE PRETEXT TO USE DENUNCIATION INSTEAD OF ARGUMENT REPLIED IN HIS OPENING SPEECH IN TURN STIGMATIZING THEM AS
7647-102250-0064 ABOLITION CONFEDERATES ASSEMBLED IN SECRET CONCLAVE ON THE HOLY SABBATH WHILE OTHER SENATORS WERE ENGAGED IN DIVINE WORSHIP PLOTTING
7647-102250-0065 IN THE NAME OF THE HOLY RELIGION PERVERTING AND
7647-102250-0066 TO HIS COURTESY TO GET TIME TO CIRCULATE THEIR DOCUMENT BEFORE ITS INFAMY COULD BE EXPOSED ET CETERA
7647-102250-0067 GLOBE MARCH FOURTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR
7647-102250-0068 THE KEY NOTES OF THE DISCUSSION THUS GIVEN WERE WELL SUSTAINED ON BOTH SIDES AND CRIMINATION AND RECRIMINATION INCREASED WITH THE HEAT AND INTENSITY OF THE CAMPAIGN
7647-102250-0069 THE GRADUAL DISRUPTION OF PARTIES AND THE NEW AND RADICAL ATTITUDES ASSUMED BY MEN OF INDEPENDENT THOUGHT GAVE AMPLE OCCASION TO INDULGE IN SUCH EPITHETS AS APOSTATES RENEGADES
7647-102250-0070 AND TRAITORS UNUSUAL ACRIMONY GREW OUT OF THE ZEAL OF THE CHURCH AND ITS MINISTERS THE CLERGYMEN OF THE NORTHERN STATES NOT ONLY SPOKE AGAINST THE REPEAL FROM THEIR PULPITS
7647-102250-0071 BUT FORWARDED ENERGETIC PETITIONS AGAINST IT TO CONGRESS
7647-102250-0072 OF NEW ENGLAND OF DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS JOINING THEIR SIGNATURES IN ONE PROTEST WE PROTEST AGAINST IT THEY SAID AS A GREAT MORAL WRONG AS A BREACH OF FAITH EMINENTLY UNJUST
7647-102250-0073 TO THE MORAL PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMUNITY AND SUBVERSIVE OF ALL CONFIDENCE IN NATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS AS A MEASURE FULL OF DANGER TO THE PEACE AND EVEN THE EXISTENCE OF OUR BELOVED UNION
7647-102250-0074 AND EXPOSING US TO THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT OF THE ALMIGHTY IN RETURN DOUGLAS MADE A MOST VIRULENT ONSLAUGHT ON THEIR POLITICAL ACTION HERE WE FIND
7647-102250-0075 HE RETORTED THAT A LARGE BODY OF PREACHERS PERHAPS THREE THOUSAND FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF A CIRCULAR WHICH WAS ISSUED BY THE ABOLITION CONFEDERATES IN THIS BODY CALCULATED TO DECEIVE AND MISLEAD THE PUBLIC
7647-102250-0076 HAVE HERE COME FORWARD WITH AN ATROCIOUS FALSEHOOD AND AN ATROCIOUS CALUMNY AGAINST THIS SENATE DESECRATED THE PULPIT AND PROSTITUTED THE SACRED DESK TO THE MISERABLE AND CORRUPTING INFLUENCE
7647-102250-0077 OF PARTY POLITICS ALL HIS NEWSPAPERS AND PARTISANS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY CAUGHT THE STYLE AND SPIRIT OF HIS WARFARE AND BOLDLY DENIED THE MORAL RIGHT OF THE CLERGY TO TAKE PART IN POLITICS
7647-102250-0078 OTHERWISE THAN BY A SILENT VOTE BUT THEY ON THE OTHER HAND PERSISTED ALL THE MORE EARNESTLY IN JUSTIFYING THEIR INTERFERENCE IN MORAL QUESTIONS WHEREVER THEY APPEARED
7647-102250-0079 AND WERE CLEARLY SUSTAINED BY THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE NORTH THOUGH THE REPEAL WAS FORCED THROUGH CONGRESS UNDER PARTY PRESSURE AND BY THE SHEER WEIGHT OF A LARGE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN BOTH BRANCHES
7647-102250-0080 IT MET FROM THE FIRST A DECIDED AND UNMISTAKABLE POPULAR CONDEMNATION IN THE FREE STATES WHILE THE MEASURE WAS YET UNDER DISCUSSION IN THE HOUSE IN MARCH NEW HAMPSHIRE LED OFF BY AN ELECTION
7647-102250-0081 COMPLETELY OBLITERATING THE EIGHTY NINE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN HER LEGISLATURE CONNECTICUT FOLLOWED IN HER FOOTSTEPS EARLY IN APRIL LONG BEFORE NOVEMBER IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION
7647-102250-0082 AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH WAS THOROUGH AND THAT ELECTION DAY WAS ANXIOUSLY AWAITED MERELY TO RECORD THE POPULAR VERDICT ALREADY DECIDED THE INFLUENCE OF THIS RESULT UPON PARTIES
7647-102250-0083 OLD AND NEW IS PERHAPS BEST ILLUSTRATED IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE THIRTY FOURTH CONGRESS CHOSEN AT THESE ELECTIONS DURING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH WITNESSED THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
7647-102250-0084 EACH CONGRESS IN ORDINARY COURSE MEETS FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT ONE YEAR AFTER ITS MEMBERS ARE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AND THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICS DURING THE INTERIM
7647-102250-0085 NEEDS ALWAYS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE THIS EFFECT HAD IF ANYTHING BEEN SLIGHTLY REACTIONARY AND THE GREAT CONTEST FOR THE SPEAKERSHIP DURING THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
7647-102250-0086 MAY THEREFORE BE TAKEN AS A FAIR MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT OF POLITICS IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR THE STRENGTH OF THE PRECEDING HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHICH MET IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
7647-102250-0087 HAD BEEN WHIGS SEVENTY ONE FREE SOILERS FOUR DEMOCRATS
7647-102250-0088 A CLEAR DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY OF EIGHTY FOUR IN THE NEW CONGRESS THERE WERE IN THE HOUSE AS NEARLY AS THE CLASSIFICATION COULD BE MADE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHT ANTI NEBRASKA MEMBERS
7647-102250-0089 NEARLY FORTY KNOW NOTHINGS AND ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DEMOCRATS THE REMAINING MEMBERS WERE UNDECIDED THE PROUD DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY OF THE PIERCE ELECTION
7647-102250-0090 WAS ANNIHILATED BUT AS YET
7647-102250-0091 ITS ELEMENTS DISTRUSTFUL JEALOUS AND DISCORDANT THE FEUDS AND BATTLES OF A QUARTER OF A CENTURY WERE NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN OR BURIED THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS BOLDLY NOMINATING MISTER RICHARDSON
7647-102250-0092 THE HOUSE LEADER ON THE NEBRASKA BILL AS THEIR CANDIDATE FOR SPEAKER MADE A LONG AND DETERMINED PUSH FOR SUCCESS BUT HIS HIGHEST RANGE OF VOTES WAS ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR TO SEVENTY SIX
7647-102250-0093 WHILE THROUGH ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE BALLOTINGS CONTINUING FROM DECEMBER THIRD TO JANUARY TWENTY THIRD THE OPPOSITION REMAINED DIVIDED MISTER BANKS THE ANTI NEBRASKA FAVORITE
7647-102250-0094 WITHIN SEVEN VOTES OF AN ELECTION AT THIS POINT RICHARDSON FINDING IT A HOPELESS STRUGGLE WITHDREW HIS NAME AS A CANDIDATE AND THE DEMOCRATIC STRENGTH WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER
7647-102250-0095 BUT WITH NO BETTER PROSPECTS FINALLY SEEING NO CHANCE OF OTHERWISE TERMINATING THE CONTEST THE HOUSE YIELDED TO THE INEVITABLE DOMINATION OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION
7647-102250-0096 AND RESOLVED ON FEBRUARY SECOND
7647-102250-0097 TO ELECT UNDER THE PLURALITY RULE AFTER THE NEXT THREE BALLOTINGS UNDER THIS RULE NOTWITHSTANDING THE MOST STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO RESCIND IT NATHANIEL P BANKS OF MASSACHUSETTS
7647-102250-0098 AGAINST ONE HUNDRED VOTES FOR WILLIAM AIKEN OF SOUTH CAROLINA
