3654-171137-0000 BOOK THREE CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF ABOUT ONE YEAR FROM VESPASIAN'S COMING TO SUBDUE THE JEWS TO THE TAKING OF GAMALA CHAPTER ONE VESPASIAN IS SENT INTO SYRIA BY NERO
3654-171137-0001 AND AS HE THOUGHT IT FIT FOR HIM WHO BARE THE BURDEN OF THE WHOLE EMPIRE TO DESPISE SUCH MISFORTUNES
3654-171137-0002 NOW IT WAS IN SO GREAT A COMMOTION AND WHO MIGHT BE BEST ABLE TO PUNISH THE JEWS FOR THEIR REBELLION AND MIGHT PREVENT THE SAME DISTEMPER FROM SEIZING UPON THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS ALSO
3654-171137-0003 SEEING HE WAS GROWING AN OLD MAN ALREADY IN THE CAMP AND FROM HIS YOUTH HAD BEEN EXERCISED IN WARLIKE EXPLOITS
3654-171137-0004 AND THAT HE HAD HIS SONS AS HOSTAGES FOR HIS FIDELITY TO HIMSELF
3654-171137-0005 PERHAPS ALSO THERE WAS SOME INTERPOSITION OF PROVIDENCE WHICH WAS PAVING THE WAY FOR VESPASIAN'S BEING HIMSELF EMPEROR AFTERWARDS UPON THE WHOLE HE SENT THIS MAN TO TAKE UPON HIM THE COMMAND OF THE ARMIES THAT WERE IN SYRIA
3654-171137-0006 BUT THIS NOT WITHOUT GREAT ENCOMIUMS AND FLATTERING COMPELLATIONS SUCH AS NECESSITY REQUIRED AND SUCH AS MIGHT MOLLIFY HIM INTO COMPLAISANCE
3654-171137-0007 WHERE HE HAD BEEN WITH NERO TO ALEXANDRIA TO BRING BACK WITH HIM FROM THENCE THE FIFTH AND THE TENTH LEGIONS WHILE HE HIMSELF WHEN HE HAD PASSED OVER THE HELLESPONT CAME BY LAND INTO SYRIA
3654-171137-0008 BUT LIKE PEOPLE BLOWN UP INTO A FLAME BY THEIR GOOD FORTUNE CARRIED THE WAR TO REMOTER PLACES ACCORDINGLY THEY PRESENTLY GOT TOGETHER A GREAT MULTITUDE OF ALL THEIR MOST HARDY SOLDIERS AND MARCHED AWAY FOR ASCALON
3654-171137-0009 OUT OF THEIR ANGER MARCHED FASTER THAN ORDINARY AND AS IF THEY HAD COME BUT A LITTLE WAY APPROACHED VERY NEAR THE CITY AND WERE COME EVEN TO IT BUT ANTONIUS WHO WAS NOT UNAPPRIZED OF THE ATTACK THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE UPON THE CITY
3654-171137-0010 DREW OUT HIS HORSEMEN BEFOREHAND AND BEING NEITHER DAUNTED AT THE MULTITUDE NOR AT THE COURAGE OF THE ENEMY RECEIVED THEIR FIRST ATTACKS WITH GREAT BRAVERY AND WHEN THEY CROWDED TO THE VERY WALLS HE BEAT THEM OFF
3654-171137-0011 NOW THE JEWS WERE UNSKILLFUL IN WAR BUT WERE TO FIGHT WITH THOSE WHO WERE SKILLFUL THEREIN THEY WERE FOOTMEN TO FIGHT WITH HORSEMEN THEY WERE IN DISORDER TO FIGHT THOSE THAT WERE UNITED TOGETHER
3654-171137-0012 THEY WERE POORLY ARMED TO FIGHT THOSE THAT WERE COMPLETELY SO THEY WERE TO FIGHT MORE BY THEIR RAGE THAN BY SOBER COUNSEL AND WERE EXPOSED TO SOLDIERS THAT WERE EXACTLY OBEDIENT AND DID EVERY THING THEY WERE BIDDEN UPON THE LEAST INTIMATION
3654-171137-0013 SO THEY WERE EASILY BEATEN FOR AS SOON AS EVER THEIR FIRST RANKS WERE ONCE IN DISORDER THEY WERE PUT TO FLIGHT BY THE ENEMY'S CAVALRY AND THOSE OF THEM THAT CAME BEHIND SUCH AS CROWDED TO THE WALL FELL UPON THEIR OWN PARTY'S WEAPONS AND BECAME ONE ANOTHER'S ENEMIES
3654-171137-0014 WHICH PLAIN WAS WIDE AND ALL FIT FOR THE HORSEMEN WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE WAS VERY COMMODIOUS FOR THE ROMANS AND OCCASIONED THE SLAUGHTER OF THE GREATEST NUMBER OF THE JEWS FOR SUCH AS RAN AWAY THEY COULD OVERRUN THEM AND MAKE THEM TURN BACK
3654-171137-0015 AND WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT THEM BACK AFTER THEIR FLIGHT AND DRIVEN THEM TOGETHER THEY RAN THEM THROUGH AND SLEW A VAST NUMBER OF THEM
3654-171137-0016 INSOMUCH THAT OTHERS ENCOMPASSED OTHERS OF THEM AND DROVE THEM BEFORE THEM WHITHERSOEVER THEY TURNED THEMSELVES AND SLEW THEM EASILY WITH THEIR ARROWS
3654-171137-0017 TILL TEN THOUSAND MEN OF THE JEWS SIDE LAY DEAD WITH TWO OF THEIR GENERALS JOHN AND SILAS AND THE GREATER PART OF THE REMAINDER WERE WOUNDED WITH NIGER THEIR REMAINING GENERAL
3654-171137-0018 CALLED SALLIS SOME FEW ALSO OF THE ROMANS
3654-171137-0019 BUT THE LOSSES THEY HAD SUSTAINED RATHER QUICKENED THEIR RESOLUTION FOR OTHER ATTEMPTS
3654-171137-0020 SO WHEN THEY HAD LAIN STILL SO LITTLE A WHILE THAT THEIR WOUNDS WERE NOT YET THOROUGHLY CURED THEY GOT TOGETHER ALL THEIR FORCES
3654-171137-0021 BUT THEIR FORMER ILL FORTUNE FOLLOWED THEM AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR UNSKILFULNESS AND OTHER DEFICIENCIES IN WAR FOR ANTONIUS LAID AMBUSHES FOR THEM IN THE PASSAGES THEY WERE TO GO THROUGH
3654-171137-0022 HOWEVER THEY WERE DRIVEN ALONG TOGETHER BY THE ENEMY WHO PRESSED HARD UPON THEM INTO A CERTAIN STRONG TOWER BELONGING TO A VILLAGE CALLED BEZEDEH
3654-171137-0023 AND ON THE THIRD DAY AFTERWARD HE SPAKE OUT OF THE GROUND TO THOSE THAT WITH GREAT LAMENTATION WERE SEARCHING FOR HIM IN ORDER TO GIVE HIM A DECENT FUNERAL AND WHEN HE WAS COME OUT HE FILLED ALL THE JEWS WITH AN UNEXPECTED JOY AS THOUGH HE WERE PRESERVED BY GOD'S PROVIDENCE TO BE THEIR COMMANDER
3654-171137-0024 WHERE HE FOUND KING AGRIPPA WITH ALL HIS FORCES WAITING FOR HIS COMING AND MARCHED TO PTOLEMAIS AT THIS CITY ALSO THE INHABITANTS OF SEPPHORIS OF GALILEE MET HIM WHO WERE FOR PEACE WITH THE ROMANS
3654-171137-0025 THESE CITIZENS HAD BEFOREHAND TAKEN CARE OF THEIR OWN SAFETY AND BEING SENSIBLE OF THE POWER OF THE ROMANS THEY HAD BEEN WITH CESTIUS GALLUS BEFORE VESPASIAN CAME AND HAD GIVEN THEIR FAITH TO HIM
3654-171137-0026 AND RECEIVED THE SECURITY OF HIS RIGHT HAND AND HAD RECEIVED A ROMAN GARRISON AND AT THIS TIME WITHAL THEY RECEIVED VESPASIAN THE ROMAN GENERAL VERY KINDLY AND READILY PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD ASSIST HIM AGAINST THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN
3654-171137-0027 NOW THE GENERAL DELIVERED THEM AT THEIR DESIRE AS MANY HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN AS HE THOUGHT SUFFICIENT TO OPPOSE THE INCURSIONS OF THE JEWS IF THEY SHOULD COME AGAINST THEM AND INDEED THE DANGER OF LOSING SEPPHORIS WOULD BE NO SMALL ONE IN THIS WAR THAT WAS NOW BEGINNING
3654-171137-0028 SEEING IT WAS THE LARGEST CITY OF GALILEE AND BUILT IN A PLACE BY NATURE VERY STRONG AND MIGHT BE A SECURITY OF THE WHOLE NATION'S FIDELITY TO THE ROMANS
3654-171137-0029 TO WHICH MOUNTAIN ADJOINS GABA WHICH IS CALLED THE CITY OF HORSEMEN BECAUSE THOSE HORSEMEN THAT WERE DISMISSED BY HEROD THE KING DWELT THEREIN THEY ARE BOUNDED ON THE SOUTH

3654-171137-0038 THEY ARE NOT NATURALLY WATERED BY MANY RIVERS BUT DERIVE THEIR CHIEF MOISTURE FROM RAIN WATER OF WHICH THEY HAVE NO WANT AND FOR THOSE RIVERS WHICH THEY HAVE
3654-171137-0039 THAN DO THOSE IN OTHER PLACES AND WHAT IS THE GREATEST SIGN OF EXCELLENCY AND OF ABUNDANCE
