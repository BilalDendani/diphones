511-131226-0000 ALSO THERE WERE BLUE MOONS
511-131226-0001 NEVERTHELESS THEY WERE AS COMMON AS WERE GREEN SUNS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE SCIENCE HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCONVENTIONALITIES SUCH PUBLICATIONS AS NATURE AND KNOWLEDGE WERE BESIEGED WITH INQUIRIES
511-131226-0002 I SUPPOSE IN ALASKA AND IN THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS ALL THE MEDICINE MEN WERE SIMILARLY UPON TRIAL SOMETHING HAD TO BE THOUGHT OF UPON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE VOLCANO OF KRAKATOA OF THE STRAITS OF SUNDA
511-131226-0003 HAD BLOWN UP TERRIFIC WE'RE TOLD THAT THE SOUND WAS HEARD TWO THOUSAND MILES AND THAT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PERSONS WERE KILLED SEEMS JUST A LITTLE UNSCIENTIFIC OR IMPOSITIVE TO ME
511-131226-0004 IT IS SAID THAT THESE PHENOMENA WERE CAUSED BY PARTICLES OF VOLCANIC DUST THAT WERE CAST HIGH IN THE AIR BY KRAKATOA THIS IS THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS THE ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA CONTINUED
511-131226-0005 EXCEPT THAT IN THE SEVEN THERE WAS A LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS AND WHERE WAS THE VOLCANIC DUST ALL THAT TIME
511-131226-0006 SO HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT SOMETHING IS NOT SOMETHING ELSE WHEN NEITHER IS SOMETHING ELSE SOME OTHER THING THERE'S NOTHING TO PROVE THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFUNDITIES THAT WE ADVERTISED IN ADVANCE
511-131226-0007 YOU CAN OPPOSE AN ABSURDITY ONLY WITH SOME OTHER ABSURDITY BUT SCIENCE IS ESTABLISHED PREPOSTEROUSNESS WE DIVIDE ALL INTELLECTION THE OBVIOUSLY PREPOSTEROUSNESS AND THE ESTABLISHED BUT KRAKATOA
511-131226-0008 THAT'S THE EXPLANATION THAT THE SCIENTISTS GAVE
511-131226-0009 AS MUCH AS IT CAN EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH THIS BOOK IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF DATA OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR DATA HAVE BEEN DAMNED UPON NO CONSIDERATION FOR INDIVIDUAL MERITS OR DEMERITS
511-131226-0010 BUT IN CONFORMITY WITH A GENERAL ATTEMPT TO HOLD OUT FOR ISOLATION OF THIS EARTH THIS IS ATTEMPTED POSITIVENESS WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT SCIENCE CAN NO MORE SUCCEED THAN
511-131226-0011 SCIENTISTS HAVE PERPETRATED SUCH AN ENORMITY AS SUSPENSION OF VOLCANIC DUST SEVEN YEARS IN THE AIR DISREGARDING THE LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS
511-131226-0012 THE ARRIVAL OF DUST FROM SOMEWHERE BEYOND THIS EARTH NOT THAT SCIENTISTS THEMSELVES HAVE EVER ACHIEVED POSITIVENESS IN ITS ASPECT OF UNITEDNESS AMONG THEMSELVES BECAUSE NORDENSKIOLD
511-131226-0013 BEFORE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE WROTE A GREAT DEAL UPON HIS THEORY OF COSMIC DUST AND PROFESSOR CLEVELAND ABBE CONTENDED AGAINST THE KRAKATOAN EXPLANATION BUT THAT THIS IS THE ORTHODOXY OF THE MAIN BODY OF SCIENTISTS
511-131226-0014 MY OWN CHIEF REASON FOR INDIGNATION HERE THAT THIS PREPOSTEROUS EXPLANATION INTERFERES WITH SOME OF MY OWN ENORMITIES IT WOULD COST ME TOO MUCH EXPLAINING IF I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE
511-131226-0015 FOR INSTANCE THE TURTLE OF VICKSBURG
511-131226-0016 AND FORTY PLATES SOME OF THEM MARVELOUSLY COLORED IT WAS ISSUED AFTER AN INVESTIGATION THAT TOOK FIVE YEARS YOU COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING DONE MORE EFFICIENTLY ARTISTICALLY AUTHORITATIVELY THE MATHEMATICAL PARTS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPRESSIVE
511-131226-0017 DISTRIBUTION OF THE DUST OF KRAKATOA VELOCITY OF TRANSLATION
511-131226-0018 ANNUAL REGISTER
511-131226-0019 BEFORE THE ERUPTION OCCURRED
511-131226-0020 THAT THEY WERE SEEN IN NATAL SOUTH AFRICA SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE ERUPTION INERTIA AND ITS INHOSPITALITY OR
511-131226-0021 RAW MEAT SHOULD NOT BE FED TO BABIES WE SHALL HAVE A FEW DATA INITIATORILY I FEAR ME THAT THE HORSE AND THE BARN WERE A LITTLE EXTREME FOR OUR BUDDING LIBERALITIES THE OUTRAGEOUS IS THE REASONABLE
511-131226-0022 IF INTRODUCED POLITELY HAILSTONES FOR INSTANCE ONE READS IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF HAILSTONES THE SIZE OF HENS EGGS ONE SMILES NEVERTHELESS I WILL ENGAGE TO LIST ONE HUNDRED INSTANCES FROM THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
511-131226-0023 OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE TWO POUNDERS AUTHENTICATED AND SIX POUNDERS REPORTED AT SERINGAPATAM INDIA ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FELL A HAILSTONE
511-131226-0024 I FEAR ME I FEAR ME THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFOUNDLY DAMNED I BLURT OUT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD PERHAPS BE WITHHELD FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES BUT THAT DAMNED THING WAS THE SIZE OF AN ELEPHANT
511-131226-0025 ONE SMILES IN MONTANA IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FELL SNOWFLAKES FIFTEEN INCHES ACROSS AND EIGHT INCHES THICK MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW NINETEEN FIFTEEN SEVENTY THREE
511-131226-0026 IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF INTELLECTION I SHOULD SAY THAT WHAT WE CALL KNOWLEDGE IS IGNORANCE SURROUNDED BY LAUGHTER BLACK RAINS RED RAINS
511-131226-0027 THE FALL OF A THOUSAND TONS OF BUTTER JET BLACK SNOW PINK SNOW BLUE HAILSTONES HAILSTONES FLAVORED LIKE ORANGES PUNK AND SILK AND CHARCOAL
511-131226-0028 ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IF ANYONE WAS SO CREDULOUS AS TO THINK THAT STONES HAD EVER FALLEN FROM THE SKY HE WAS REASONED WITH IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE NO STONES IN THE SKY THEREFORE NO STONES CAN FALL FROM THE SKY
511-131226-0029 OR NOTHING MORE REASONABLE OR SCIENTIFIC OR LOGICAL THAN THAT COULD BE SAID UPON ANY SUBJECT THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THE UNIVERSAL TROUBLE THAT THE MAJOR PREMISE IS NOT REAL OR IS INTERMEDIATE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN REALNESS
511-131226-0030 AND UNREALNESS IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO A COMMITTEE OF WHOM LAVOISIER WAS A MEMBER WAS APPOINTED BY THE FRENCH ACADEMY TO INVESTIGATE A REPORT THAT A STONE HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY AT LUCE FRANCE
511-131226-0031 THE EXCLUSIONISTS EXPLANATION AT THAT TIME WAS THAT STONES DO NOT FALL FROM THE SKY
511-131226-0032 AND THAT HOT STONES MAY BE PICKED UP WHERE A LUMINOUS OBJECT SEEMINGLY HAD LANDED ONLY LIGHTNING STRIKING A STONE HEATING EVEN MELTING IT THE STONE OF LUCE SHOWED SIGNS OF FUSION
511-131226-0033 LAVOISIER'S ANALYSIS ABSOLUTELY PROVED
511-131226-0034 SO AUTHORITATIVELY FALLING STONES WERE DAMNED THE STOCK MEANS OF EXCLUSION REMAINED THE EXPLANATION OF LIGHTNING THAT WAS SEEN TO STRIKE SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE
511-131226-0035 BUT POSITIVENESS AND THE FATE OF EVERY POSITIVE STATEMENT IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO THINK OF DAMNED STONES RAISING AN OUTCRY AGAINST A SENTENCE OF EXCLUSION BUT SUBJECTIVELY
511-131226-0036 OR DATA OF THEM BOMBARDED THE WALLS RAISED AGAINST THEM MONTHLY REVIEW
511-131226-0037 THE PHENOMENON WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE REMARKS BEFORE US WILL SEEM TO MOST PERSONS AS LITTLE WORTHY OF CREDIT AS ANY THAT COULD BE OFFERED THE FALLING OF LARGE STONES FROM THE SKY WITHOUT ANY ASSIGNABLE CAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS ASCENT
511-131226-0038 SEEMS TO PARTAKE SO MUCH OF THE MARVELOUS AS ALMOST ENTIRELY TO EXCLUDE THE OPERATION OF KNOWN AND NATURAL AGENTS YET A BODY OF EVIDENCE IS HERE BROUGHT TO PROVE THAT SUCH EVENTS HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE
511-131226-0039 THE WRITER ABANDONS THE FIRST OR ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION AND MODIFIES IT WITH THE EXPLANATION THAT THE DAY BEFORE A REPORTED FALL OF STONES IN TUSCANY JUNE SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR THERE HAD BEEN AN ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS
511-131226-0040 IT'S MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS LATER
511-131226-0041 THAT HAS EVER BEEN ACCEPTABLY TRACED TO TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN FALLING STONES HAD TO BE UNDAMNED
511-131226-0042 OF OUTSIDE FORCES ONE MAY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF A LAVOISIER AND STILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANALYZE NOT BE ABLE EVEN TO SEE
511-131226-0043 EXCEPT CONFORMABLY WITH THE HYPNOSES OR THE CONVENTIONAL REACTIONS AGAINST HYPNOSES OF ONE'S ERA WE BELIEVE NO MORE WE ACCEPT
511-131226-0044 LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHIRLWIND AND VOLCANO EXPLANATIONS HAD TO BE ABANDONED BUT SO POWERFUL WAS THIS EXCLUSION HYPNOSIS SENTENCE OF DAMNATION OR THIS ATTEMPT AT POSITIVENESS
511-131226-0045 THAT FAR INTO OUR OWN TIMES SOME SCIENTISTS NOTABLY PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH AND SIR ROBERT BALL CONTINUED TO HOLD OUT AGAINST ALL EXTERNAL ORIGINS ASSERTING THAT NOTHING COULD FALL TO THIS EARTH
511-131226-0046 BUT THE COMMON IMPRESSION OF THEM IS ONLY A RETREAT OF ATTEMPTED EXCLUSION THAT ONLY TWO KINDS OF SUBSTANCE FALL FROM THE SKY METALLIC AND STONY
511-131226-0047 AS LATE AS NOVEMBER NINETEEN O TWO
511-131226-0048 A MEMBER OF THE SELBORNE SOCIETY STILL ARGUED THAT METEORITES DO NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY ARE MASSES OF IRON UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT ATTRACT LIGHTNING
