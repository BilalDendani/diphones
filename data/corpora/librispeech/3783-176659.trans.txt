3783-176659-0000 WITH MEMORIES OF THE FEUD WHICH HAD LONG EMBROILED THE WHOLE COUNTY NOT THAT EVERYBODY TOOK PART IN IT BUT ON THE MATTER EVERYBODY AS AN OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM HAD FEELIN'S IT HAD BEGUN SO HE LEARNED JUST AFTER THE WAR
3783-176659-0001 TWO BOYS WERE PLAYING MARBLES IN THE ROAD ALONG THE CUMBERLAND RIVER AND ONE HAD A PATCH ON THE SEAT OF HIS TROUSERS THE OTHER BOY MADE FUN OF IT AND THE BOY WITH THE PATCH WENT HOME AND TOLD HIS FATHER AS A RESULT THERE HAD ALREADY BEEN THIRTY YEARS OF LOCAL WAR
3783-176659-0002 IN THE LAST RACE FOR LEGISLATURE POLITICAL ISSUES WERE SUBMERGED AND THE FEUD WAS THE SOLE ISSUE AND A TOLLIVER HAD CARRIED THAT BOY'S TROUSER PATCH LIKE A FLAG TO VICTORY AND WAS SITTING IN THE LOWER HOUSE AT THAT TIME HELPING TO MAKE LAWS FOR THE REST OF THE STATE NOW BAD RUFE TOLLIVER
3783-176659-0003 WAS IN THE HILLS AGAIN AND THE END WAS NOT YET ALREADY PEOPLE WERE POURING IN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THE MEN SLOUCH HATTED AND STALKING THROUGH THE MUD IN THE RAIN OR FILING IN ON HORSEBACK RIDING DOUBLE SOMETIMES TWO MEN OR TWO WOMEN
3783-176659-0004 OR A WOMAN WITH A BABY IN HER LAP AND TWO MORE CHILDREN BEHIND ALL DRESSED IN HOMESPUN OR STORE CLOTHES AND THE PAINT FROM ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS ON HER HAT STREAKING THE FACE OF EVERY GIRL WHO HAD UNWISELY SCANNED THE HEAVENS THAT MORNING
3783-176659-0005 SOON THE SQUARE WAS FILLED WITH HITCHED HORSES AND AN AUCTIONEER WAS BIDDING OFF CATTLE SHEEP HOGS AND HORSES TO THE CROWD OF MOUNTAINEERS ABOUT HIM WHILE THE WOMEN SOLD EGGS AND BUTTER AND BOUGHT THINGS FOR USE AT HOME
3783-176659-0006 NOW AND THEN AN OPEN FEUDSMAN WITH A WINCHESTER PASSED AND MANY A MAN WAS BELTED WITH CARTRIDGES FOR THE BIG PISTOL DANGLING AT HIS HIP WHEN COURT OPENED THE RAIN CEASED THE SUN CAME OUT AND HALE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD TO THE BATTERED TEMPLE OF JUSTICE
3783-176659-0007 ON ONE CORNER OF THE SQUARE HE COULD SEE THE CHIEF STORE OF THE TOWN MARKED BUCK FALIN GENERAL MERCHANDISE AND THE BIG MAN IN THE DOOR WITH THE BUSHY REDHEAD HE GUESSED WAS THE LEADER OF THE FALIN CLAN OUTSIDE THE DOOR STOOD A SMALLER REPLICA OF THE SAME FIGURE
3783-176659-0008 WHOM HE RECOGNIZED AS THE LEADER OF THE BAND THAT HAD NEARLY RIDDEN HIM DOWN AT THE GAP WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING FOR YOUNG DAVE TOLLIVER THE AUTUMN BEFORE THAT DOUBTLESS WAS YOUNG BUCK
3783-176659-0009 AND THE GRIZZLED JUDGE WAS SPEAKING ANGRILY THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE HAD THIS TRIAL POSTPONED BECAUSE YOU HAIN'T GOT NO LAWYER I AIN'T GOIN TO PUT IT OFF HAVE YOU GOT YOU A LAWYER NOW YES JEDGE SAID THE DEFENDANT
3783-176659-0010 HE'LL DO YOU MORE GOOD THAR THAN ANY WHAR ELSE HALE LAUGHED ALOUD THE JUDGE GLARED AT HIM AND HE TURNED QUICKLY UPSTAIRS TO HIS WORK IN THE DEED ROOM TILL NOON HE WORKED AND YET THERE WAS NO TROUBLE AFTER DINNER HE WENT BACK AND IN TWO HOURS HIS WORK WAS DONE
3783-176659-0011 AN ATMOSPHERIC DIFFERENCE HE FELT AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE DOOR THE CROWD HAD MELTED FROM THE SQUARE THERE WERE NO WOMEN IN SIGHT BUT EIGHT ARMED MEN WERE IN FRONT OF THE DOOR AND TWO OF THEM A RED FALIN AND A BLACK TOLLIVER BAD RUFE IT WAS WERE QUARRELLING
3783-176659-0012 IN EVERY DOORWAY STOOD A MAN CAUTIOUSLY LOOKING ON AND IN A HOTEL WINDOW HE SAW A WOMAN'S FRIGHTENED FACE IT WAS SO STILL THAT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT A TRAGEDY COULD BE IMMINENT AND YET WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO TAKE THE CONDITIONS IN ONE OF THE QUARRELLING MEN
3783-176659-0013 BAD RUFE TOLLIVER WHIPPED OUT HIS REVOLVER AND BEFORE HE COULD LEVEL IT A FALIN STRUCK THE MUZZLE OF A PISTOL INTO HIS BACK ANOTHER TOLLIVER FLASHED HIS WEAPON ON THE FALIN THIS TOLLIVER WAS COVERED BY ANOTHER FALIN AND IN SO MANY FLASHES OF LIGHTNING
3783-176659-0014 THE EIGHT MEN IN FRONT OF HIM WERE COVERING EACH OTHER EVERY MAN AFRAID TO BE THE FIRST TO SHOOT SINCE HE KNEW THAT THE FLASH OF HIS OWN PISTOL MEANT INSTANTANEOUS DEATH FOR HIM AS HALE SHRANK BACK HE PUSHED AGAINST SOMEBODY WHO THRUST HIM ASIDE IT WAS THE JUDGE
3783-176659-0015 WHY DON'T SOMEBODY SHOOT HE ASKED SARCASTICALLY YOU'RE A PURTY SET O FOOLS AIN'T YOU
3783-176659-0016 NOW WHEN I GIVE THE WORD I WANT YOU JIM FALIN AND RUFE TOLLIVER THAR TO DRAP YER GUNS ALREADY RUFE WAS GRINNING LIKE A DEVIL OVER THE ABSURDITY OF THE SITUATION NOW SAID THE JUDGE AND THE TWO GUNS WERE DROPPED PUT EM IN YO POCKETS THEY DID DRAP
3783-176659-0017 ALL DROPPED AND WITH THOSE TWO ALL PUT UP THEIR GUNS EACH MAN HOWEVER WATCHING NOW THE MAN WHO HAD JUST BEEN COVERING HIM IT IS NOT WISE FOR THE STRANGER TO SHOW TOO MUCH INTEREST IN THE PERSONAL AFFAIRS OF MOUNTAIN MEN
3783-176659-0018 AND HALE LEFT THE JUDGE BERATING THEM AND WENT TO THE HOTEL TO GET READY FOR THE GAP LITTLE DREAMING HOW FIXED THE FACES OF SOME OF THOSE MEN WERE IN HIS BRAIN AND HOW LATER THEY WERE TO RISE IN HIS MEMORY AGAIN HIS HORSE WAS LAME BUT HE MUST GO ON
3783-176659-0019 FROM THE LANDLORD AND WHEN THE BEAST WAS BROUGHT AROUND HE OVERHEARD TWO MEN TALKING AT THE END OF THE PORCH
3783-176659-0020 THE HOME GOING PEOPLE WERE HELPING EACH OTHER ACROSS IT AND AS HALE APPROACHED THE FORD OF A CREEK HALF A MILE BEYOND THE RIVER A BLACK HAIRED GIRL WAS STANDING ON A BOULDER LOOKING HELPLESSLY AT THE YELLOW WATER AND TWO BOYS WERE ON THE GROUND BELOW HER ONE OF THEM LOOKED UP AT HALE
