6072-89736-0000 WHEN THE MAITRE D'HOTEL HAD SHOWN HIM ALL OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT
6072-89736-0001 BUT ALSO TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NO RODDY WERE DISPOSED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
6072-89736-0002 IN ADDITION TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TEMPERATE CONTEMPT FOR SPIES OF THE LAW AND ALL THEIR WAYS AGAINST THE PERIL INHERENT IN THIS LAST HOWEVER HE WAS SELF WARNED ESTEEMING IT THE MOST FATAL CHINK IN THE ARMOUR OF THE LAWBREAKER
6072-89736-0003 THIS DISPOSITION TO UNDERESTIMATE THE ACUMEN OF THE POLICE FAR TOO MANY PROMISING YOUNG ADVENTURERS LIKE HIMSELF WERE ANNUALLY LAID BY THE HEELS IN THAT SNARE OF THEIR OWN INFATUATE WEAVING
6072-89736-0004 THE MOUSE HAS EVERY RIGHT IF HE LIKES TO DESPISE THE CAT FOR A HEAVY HANDED AND BLOODTHIRSTY BEAST LACKING WIT AND IMAGINATION A CREATURE OF SIMPLE FORCE MAJEURE BUT THAT MOUSE WILL NOT ADVISEDLY SWAGGER IN CAT HAUNTED TERRITORY
6072-89736-0005 A BLOW OF THE PAW IS WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE A BLOW OF THE PAW SOMETHING TO NUMB THE WITS OF THE WILIEST MOUSE CONSIDERING RODDY HE BELIEVED IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GAUGE THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT ESSENTIALLY BRITISH INTELLIGENCE
6072-89736-0006 SOMETHING AS SELF CONTAINED AS A LONDON FLAT ONE THING ONLY WAS CERTAIN RODDY DIDN'T ALWAYS THINK IN TERMS OF BEEF AND BASS HE WAS NOBODY'S FACILE FOOL HE COULD MAKE A SHREWD INFERENCE AS WELL AS STRIKE A SHREWD BLOW REVIEWING THE SCENE IN THE RESTAURANT
6072-89736-0007 BUT THAT THE FRENCHMAN WAS WELL AWARE OF THAT INTEREST AND HE RESENTED SINCERELY HIS INABILITY TO FEEL AS CONFIDENT THAT THE COUNT WITH HIS GOSSIP ABOUT THE LONE WOLF HAD BEEN MERELY SEEKING TO DIVERT RODDY'S INTEREST TO PUTATIVELY LARGER GAME
6072-89736-0008 IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT DE MORBIHAN'S IDENTIFICATION OF LANYARD WITH THAT MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE AT LEAST BY INNUENDO HAD BEEN UNINTENTIONAL BUT SOMEHOW LANYARD DIDN'T BELIEVE IT HAD THE TWO QUESTIONS TROUBLED HIM SORELY
6072-89736-0009 DID DE MORBIHAN KNOW DID HE MERELY SUSPECT OR HAD HE ONLY LOOSED AN AIMLESS SHOT WHICH CHANCE HAD SPED TO THE RIGHT GOAL HAD THE MIND OF RODDY PROVED FALLOW TO THAT SUGGESTION OR HAD IT WITH ITS SIMPLE NATIONAL TENACITY
6072-89736-0010 BEEN IMPATIENT OF SUCH SIDE ISSUES OR INCREDULOUS AND PERSISTED IN FOCUSING ITS PROCESSES UPON THE PERSONALITY AND ACTIVITIES OF MONSIEUR LE COMTE REMY DE MORBIHAN HOWEVER ONE WOULD SURELY LEARN SOMETHING ILLUMINATING BEFORE VERY LONG
6072-89736-0011 JUST AT PRESENT REASONING FROM NOISES AUDIBLE THROUGH THE BOLTED DOOR THAT COMMUNICATED WITH THE ADJOINING BED CHAMBER THE BUSINESS OF A SLEUTH SEEMED TO COMPRISE GOING TO BED LANYARD SHAVING AND DRESSING
6072-89736-0012 COULD DISTINCTLY HEAR A TUNELESS VOICE CONTENTEDLY HUMMING SALLY IN OUR ALLEY A RENDITION PUNCTUATED BY ONE HEAVY THUMP AND THEN ANOTHER AND THEN BY A HEARTFELT SIGH OF RELIEF AS RODDY KICKED OFF HIS BOOTS AND FOLLOWED BY THE TAPPING OF A PIPE AGAINST GRATE BARS
6072-89736-0013 THE SQUEAL OF A WINDOW LOWERED FOR VENTILATION THE CLICK OF AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE CREAKING OF BED SPRINGS FINALLY AND BEFORE LANYARD HAD FINISHED DRESSING THE MAN FROM SCOTLAND YARD BEGAN PLACIDLY TO SNORE OF COURSE
6072-89736-0014 BUT THIS WAS A QUESTION WHICH THE ADVENTURER MEANT TO HAVE ANSWERED BEFORE HE WENT OUT IT WAS HARD UPON TWELVE O'CLOCK WHEN THE MIRROR ON THE DRESSING TABLE ASSURED HIM THAT HE WAS AT LENGTH POINT DEVICE IN THE HABIT AND APPAREL OF A GENTLEMAN OF ELEGANT NOCTURNAL LEISURE
6072-89736-0015 BUT IF HE APPROVED THE FIGURE HE CUT IT WAS MAINLY BECAUSE CLOTHES INTERESTED HIM AND HE RECKONED HIS OWN IMPECCABLE OF THEIR TENANT HE WAS FEELING JUST THEN A BIT LESS SURE THAN HE HAD HALF AN HOUR SINCE HIS REGARD WAS LOURING AND MISTRUSTFUL
6072-89736-0016 HE WAS IN SHORT SUFFERING REACTION FROM THE HIGH SPIRITS ENGENDERED BY HIS CROSS CHANNEL EXPLOITS HIS SUCCESSFUL GET AWAY AND THE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDANT UPON HIS RETURN TO THIS MEMORY HAUNTED MAUSOLEUM OF AN UNHAPPY CHILDHOOD
6072-89736-0017 HE EVEN SHIVERED A TRIFLE AS IF UNDER PREMONITION OF MISFORTUNE AND ASKED HIMSELF HEAVILY WHY NOT FOR LOGICALLY CONSIDERED A BREAK IN THE RUN OF HIS LUCK WAS DUE THUS FAR HE HAD PLAYED WITH A SUCCESS ALMOST TOO UNIFORM
6072-89736-0018 HIS DUAL ROLE BY DAY THE AMIABLE AMATEUR OF ART BY NIGHT THE NAMELESS MYSTERY THAT PROWLED UNSEEN AND PREYED UNHINDERED COULD SUCH SUCCESS BE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO ATTEND HIM ALWAYS SHOULD HE COUNT DE MORBIHAN'S YARN A WARNING
6072-89736-0019 BLACK MUST TURN UP EVERY SO OFTEN IN A RUN OF RED EVERY GAMBLER KNOWS AS MUCH AND WHAT WAS MICHAEL LANYARD BUT A COMMON GAMBLER
6072-89736-0020 WHO PERSISTENTLY STAKED LIFE AND LIBERTY AGAINST THE BLINDLY IMPARTIAL CASTS OF CHANCE WITH ONE LAST LOOK ROUND TO MAKE CERTAIN THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE CALCULATED DISORDER OF HIS ROOM TO INCRIMINATE HIM WERE IT TO BE SEARCHED IN HIS ABSENCE
6072-89736-0021 LANYARD ENVELOPED HIMSELF IN A LONG FULL SKIRTED COAT CLAPPED ON AN OPERA HAT AND WENT OUT NOISILY LOCKING THE DOOR HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE LEFT IT WIDE BUT IT WOULD DO NO HARM TO PRETEND HE DIDN'T KNOW THE BED CHAMBER KEYS AT TROYON'S WERE INTERCHANGEABLE
6072-89736-0022 IDENTICALLY THE SAME KEYS IN FACT THAT HAD BEEN IN SERVICE IN THE DAYS OF MARCEL THE WRETCHED A SINGLE HALF POWER ELECTRIC BULB NOW MODIFIED THE GLOOM OF THE CORRIDOR
6072-89736-0023 HE OPENED IT AND HESITATED A MOMENT LOOKING OUT AS THOUGH QUESTIONING THE WEATHER SIMULTANEOUSLY HIS DEFT FINGERS WEDGED THE LATCH BACK WITH A THIN SLIP OF STEEL NO RAIN IN FACT HAD FALLEN WITHIN THE HOUR
6072-89736-0024 BUT STILL THE SKY WAS DENSE WITH A SULLEN RACK AND STILL THE SIDEWALKS WERE INKY WET
6072-89736-0025 STEPPING OUT HE SLAMMED THE DOOR AND STRODE BRISKLY ROUND THE CORNER AS IF MAKING FOR THE CAB RANK THAT LINES UP ALONG THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS SIDE OF THE RUE DE MEDICIS HIS BOOT HEELS MADE A CHEERFUL RACKET IN THAT QUIET HOUR HE WAS QUITE AUDIBLY GOING AWAY FROM TROYON'S
6072-89736-0026 HE TURNED THE NEXT CORNER AND THEN THE NEXT ROUNDING THE BLOCK AND PRESENTLY REAPPROACHING THE ENTRANCE TO TROYON'S PAUSED IN THE RECESS OF A DARK DOORWAY AND LIFTING ONE FOOT AFTER ANOTHER SLIPPED RUBBER CAPS OVER HIS HEELS
6072-89736-0027 THEREAFTER HIS PROGRESS WAS PRACTICALLY NOISELESS THE SMALLER DOOR YIELDED TO HIS TOUCH WITHOUT A MURMUR INSIDE HE CLOSED IT GENTLY AND STOOD A MOMENT LISTENING WITH ALL HIS SENSES NOT WITH HIS EARS ALONE BUT WITH EVERY NERVE AND FIBRE OF HIS BEING
6072-89736-0028 WITH HIS IMAGINATION TO BOOT BUT THERE WAS NEVER A SOUND OR MOVEMENT IN ALL THE HOUSE THAT HE COULD DETECT
6072-89736-0029 AND NO SHADOW COULD HAVE MADE LESS NOISE THAN HE SLIPPING CAT FOOTED ACROSS THE COURTYARD AND UP THE STAIRS AVOIDING WITH SUPER DEVELOPED SENSITIVENESS EVERY LIFT THAT MIGHT COMPLAIN BENEATH HIS TREAD IN A TRICE HE WAS AGAIN IN THE CORRIDOR LEADING TO HIS BED CHAMBER
6072-89736-0030 IT WAS QUITE AS GLOOMY AND EMPTY AS IT HAD BEEN FIVE MINUTES AGO YET WITH A DIFFERENCE A SOMETHING IN ITS ATMOSPHERE THAT MADE HIM NOD BRIEFLY IN CONFIRMATION OF THAT SUSPICION WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM BACK SO STEALTHILY FOR ONE THING RODDY HAD STOPPED SNORING
6072-89736-0031 AND LANYARD SMILED OVER THE THOUGHT THAT THE MAN FROM SCOTLAND YARD MIGHT PROFITABLY HAVE COPIED THAT TRICK OF POOR BOURKE'S OF SNORING LIKE THE SEVEN SLEEPERS WHEN MOST COMPLETELY AWAKE
6072-89736-0032 IT WAS NATURALLY NO SURPRISE TO FIND HIS BED CHAMBER DOOR UNLOCKED AND SLIGHTLY AJAR LANYARD MADE SURE OF THE READINESS OF HIS AUTOMATIC STRODE INTO THE ROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR QUIETLY BUT BY NO MEANS SOUNDLESSLY
6072-89736-0033 HE HAD LEFT THE SHADES DOWN AND THE HANGINGS DRAWN AT BOTH WINDOWS AND SINCE THESE HAD NOT BEEN DISTURBED SOMETHING NEARLY APPROACHING COMPLETE DARKNESS REIGNED IN THE ROOM BUT THOUGH PROMPTLY ON ENTERING HIS FINGERS CLOSED UPON THE WALL SWITCH NEAR THE DOOR
6072-89736-0034 HE REFRAINED FROM TURNING UP THE LIGHTS IMMEDIATELY WITH A FANCY OF IMPISH INSPIRATION THAT IT WOULD BE AMUSING TO LEARN WHAT MOVE RODDY WOULD MAKE WHEN THE TENSION BECAME TOO MUCH EVEN FOR HIS TRAINED NERVES
6072-89736-0035 SEVERAL SECONDS PASSED WITHOUT THE LEAST SOUND DISTURBING THE STILLNESS LANYARD HIMSELF GREW A LITTLE IMPATIENT FINDING THAT HIS SIGHT FAILED TO GROW ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS BECAUSE THAT LAST WAS TOO ABSOLUTE
6072-89736-0036 PRESSING AGAINST HIS STARING EYEBALLS LIKE A BLACK FLUID IMPENETRABLY OPAQUE AS UNBROKEN AS THE HUSH STILL HE WAITED SURELY RODDY WOULDN'T BE ABLE MUCH LONGER TO ENDURE SUCH SUSPENSE AND SURELY ENOUGH
6072-89736-0037 THE SILENCE WAS ABRUPTLY BROKEN BY A STRANGE AND MOVING SOUND A HUSHED CRY OF ALARM THAT WAS HALF A MOAN AND HALF A SOB LANYARD HIMSELF WAS STARTLED FOR THAT WAS NEVER RODDY'S VOICE
6072-89736-0038 IN PITY'S NAME WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT
