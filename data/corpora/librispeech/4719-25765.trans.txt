4719-25765-0000 CHAPTER ONE AFTER SHILOH THE GREAT BATTLE OF SHILOH HAD BEEN FOUGHT AND VICTORY HAD BEEN SNATCHED FROM THE HANDS OF THE CONFEDERATES BY THE OPPORTUNE ARRIVAL OF BUELL'S ARMY THE SOUTHERNERS HAD LOST THEIR BELOVED COMMANDER SLAIN A THIRD OF THEIR NUMBER HAD FALLEN
4719-25765-0001 ALTHOUGH DEFEATED THEY HAD NOT BEEN CONQUERED THEY HAD SET FORTH FROM CORINTH IN THE HIGHEST HOPES FULLY EXPECTING TO DRIVE GRANT'S ARMY INTO THE TENNESSEE RIVER THIS HOPE WAS ALMOST REALIZED WHEN IT SUDDENLY PERISHED TWENTY THOUSAND FRESH TROOPS HAD ARRIVED UPON THE FIELD
4719-25765-0002 BUT THEY HAD FALLEN BACK UNMOLESTED FOR THE FEDERAL ARMY HAD BEEN TOO SEVERELY PUNISHED TO THINK OF PURSUING BOTH ARMIES WERE WILLING TO REST AND HAVE THEIR DECIMATED RANKS FILLED WITH FRESH TROOPS
4719-25765-0003 NONE FELT THEIR DEFEAT MORE KEENLY THAN THE KENTUCKY BRIGADE
4719-25765-0004 THEY HAD FOUGHT AS ONLY BRAVE MEN CAN FIGHT THEY LEFT ONE THIRD OF THEIR NUMBER ON THE FIELD KILLED AND WOUNDED DEFEAT COULD NOT DEMORALIZE THEM AND IT FELL TO THEIR LOT TO COVER THE RETREAT OF BEAUREGARD THEY HAD STOOD LIKE A WALL OF ADAMANT BETWEEN THEIR FLEEING ARMY AND THE VICTORIOUS FEDERALS
4719-25765-0005 NO CHARGE COULD PIERCE THAT LINE OF HEROES WITH FACES TO THE FOE THEY SLOWLY FELL BACK CONTESTING EVERY INCH OF GROUND
4719-25765-0006 AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF GENERAL JOHN C BRECKINRIDGE CONSPICUOUS IN THAT GROUP OF NOTABLE MEN WAS ONE WHOSE INSIGNIA OF OFFICE SHOWED HIM TO BE ONLY A CAPTAIN BUT HE WAS ALREADY A MARKED MAN
4719-25765-0007 IT WAS BUT NATURAL THAT IN SUCH A GATHERING THE SITUATION WOULD BE FREELY DISCUSSED IT LOOKS TO ME SAID BRECKINRIDGE WITH A SIGH THAT IF WE ARE FORCED TO GIVE UP CORINTH OUR CAUSE IN THE WEST WILL BE LOST I AM IN FAVOR OF HOLDING CORINTH TO THE LAST MAN WHAT IS YOUR OPINION MORGAN
4719-25765-0008 ASKED ONE OF THE OFFICERS TURNING TO THE CAPTAIN OF WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN THUS ADDRESSED JOHN H MORGAN MODESTLY ANSWERED THE GENERAL WILL PARDON ME IF I DIFFER WITH HIM SOMEWHAT IN HIS OPINION CORINTH SHOULD BE HELD AS LONG AS THAT CAN BE DONE WITH SAFETY TO THE ARMY
4719-25765-0009 BUT CORINTH ITSELF IS OF LITTLE VALUE TO US
4719-25765-0010 NOT KNOWING THE FLATTERING WORDS SPOKEN OF HIM MORGAN WENDED HIS WAY TO HIS HEADQUARTERS WHERE HE WAS INFORMED BY THE ORDERLY WHO TOOK HIS HORSE THAT A YOUNG CONFEDERATE OFFICER HAD BEEN WAITING FOR SOME TIME TO SEE HIM HE SAID HE MUST SEE YOU CONTINUED THE ORDERLY AND IF NECESSARY HE WOULD WAIT ALL NIGHT
4719-25765-0011 ALL RIGHT I WILL SEE WHAT HE WANTS REPLIED MORGAN
4719-25765-0012 THERE HE WAS GREETED BY A YOUNG MAN NOT MUCH MORE THAN A BOY WHO WORE THE UNIFORM OF A CONFEDERATE LIEUTENANT MORGAN GAVE HIM A SWIFT GLANCE AND THEN EXCLAIMED BLESS MY HEART IF THIS ISN'T CALHOUN PENNINGTON SON OF MY OLD FRIEND JUDGE PENNINGTON I AM MORE THAN GLAD TO SEE YOU
4719-25765-0013 LET'S SEE YOU WERE ON THE STAFF OF THE LATE LAMENTED GOVERNOR JOHNSON WERE YOU NOT YES REPLIED CALHOUN AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED AND TEARS CAME INTO HIS EYES IN SPITE OF HIMSELF AS HE THOUGHT OF THE DEATH OF HIS BELOVED CHIEF A GRAND MAN A BRAVE MAN SAID MORGAN GENTLY
4719-25765-0014 THAT IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO SEE YOU ABOUT GENERAL BEAUREGARD HAS OFFERED ME A POSITION ON HIS STAFF BUT I WANTED TO SEE YOU BEFORE I ACCEPTED WHAT A POSITION ON THE STAFF OF GENERAL BEAUREGARD THAT IS A RARE HONOR FOR ONE SO YOUNG AS YOU ARE OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING TO ACCEPT I DO NOT KNOW YET
4719-25765-0015 GREAT AS THE HONOR IS WHICH HAS BEEN OFFERED ME I FEEL IT IS A SERVICE WHICH WOULD NOT BE AGREEABLE TO ME I MUCH PREFER THE FREER LIFE OF A SCOUT AND RANGER
4719-25765-0016 MORGAN MUSED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SUDDENLY ASKED ARE YOU NOT A COUSIN OF FREDERIC SHACKELFORD
4719-25765-0017 CALHOUN'S BROW CLOUDED YES HE ANSWERED BUT WHY DO YOU SAY THE LATE COLONEL SHACKELFORD UNCLE DICK IS NOT DEAD IS THAT SO
4719-25765-0018 HE WAS DESPERATELY WOUNDED ANSWERED CALHOUN BUT HE DID NOT DIE AND HE IS NOW A PRISONER IN THE HANDS OF THE YANKEES UNCLE DICK IS A HERO BUT AS FOR THAT TRAITOR COUSIN OF MINE I HATE HIM AND AGAIN CALHOUN'S BROW GREW DARK I HAVE NO REASON TO LOVE HIM LAUGHED MORGAN
4719-25765-0019 BUT I CANNOT HELP ADMIRING HIM HE IT WAS WHO DISCOVERED OUR WELL LAID PLANS AND FORCED ME TO FLEE FROM LEXINGTON AS A THIEF IN THE NIGHT AYE ANSWERED CALHOUN BUT FOR HIM AND THAT BRUTE NELSON KENTUCKY WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE UNION BUT THAT IS NOT ALL
4719-25765-0020 HAD THERE BEEN NO NELSON BUELL'S ARMY WOULD NOT HAVE REACHED GRANT IN TIME TO SAVE HIM FROM DESTRUCTION
4719-25765-0021 I SHOULD HAVE BORNE THE NEWS TO GENERAL JOHNSTON THAT BUELL WOULD JOIN GRANT BY THE FIFTH AND JOHNSTON WOULD HAVE MADE HIS ATTACK A COUPLE OF DAYS EARLIER I WAS BEARING THE NEWS TO JOHNSTON THAT NELSON WOULD REACH SAVANNAH BY THE FIFTH WHEN I WAS CAPTURED CAPTURED ECHOED MORGAN IN SURPRISE
4719-25765-0022 YES CAPTURED AND BY NO LESS A PERSONAGE THAN MY COUSIN FRED SHACKELFORD BUT FOR THIS I WOULD HAVE REACHED JOHNSTON BY THE SECOND AS IT WAS I DID NOT REACH SHILOH UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE LAST DAY OF THE BATTLE THEN YOU ESCAPED QUERIED MORGAN NO MY COUSIN LET ME GO
4719-25765-0023 I WAS DRESSED IN CITIZEN'S CLOTHES
4719-25765-0024 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL TO HIM BUT I AM NOT
4719-25765-0025 AND YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL TO HIM WHETHER YOU ARE OR NOT
4719-25765-0026 BUT AS I FAILED TO GET HIM I BELIEVE YOU WOULD MAKE A SPLENDID SUBSTITUTE YOU STILL THINK YOU HAD RATHER GO WITH ME THAN BE ON BEAUREGARD'S STAFF A THOUSAND TIMES YES I HAD RATHER GO WITH YOU AS A PRIVATE THAN BE A LIEUTENANT ON THE GENERAL'S STAFF ANSWERED CALHOUN WITH VEHEMENCE MORGAN'S EYES SPARKLED
4719-25765-0027 TO SERVE IN THE RANKS AS A PRIVATE SOLDIER YET MY COMPANIES ARE FULLY OFFICERED NOW LET'S SEE HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO BACK TO KENTUCKY GO BACK TO KENTUCKY ASKED CALHOUN IN SURPRISE YES TO RECRUIT FOR MY COMMAND DO YOU THINK YOU COULD DODGE THE YANKEES
4719-25765-0028 I BELIEVE I COULD I COULD AT LEAST TRY ANSWERED CALHOUN HIS FACE AGLOW WITH THE IDEA
4719-25765-0029 AND AM GOING TO TRY TO REACH KENTUCKY MY PRESENT FORCE IS SMALL NOT MUCH OVER FOUR HUNDRED I DO NOT LOOK FOR MUCH HELP FROM THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT THOSE IN AUTHORITY DO NOT REGARD WITH MUCH FAVOR INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATIONS TO AUGMENT MY FORCE I MUST IN A GREAT MEASURE RELY ON MY OWN EFFORTS
4719-25765-0030 I KNOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THE FLOWER OF KENTUCKY YOUTHS EAGER TO JOIN ME IF THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY YOU ARE JUST THE PERSON TO SEND BACK TO ORGANIZE THEM WHEN CAN YOU START IN THE MORNING ANSWERED CALHOUN MORGAN SMILED GOOD HE SAID YOU ARE MADE OF THE RIGHT MATERIAL
4719-25765-0031 HE WAS TO BE ONE OF MORGAN'S MEN IT WAS ALL HE WISHED THE NEXT MORNING CALHOUN INFORMED GENERAL BEAUREGARD THAT WHILE SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT HONOR WHICH HE WOULD BESTOW ON HIM BY APPOINTING HIM A MEMBER OF HIS STAFF YET HE BELIEVED HE COULD BE OF MORE SERVICE TO THE SOUTH
4719-25765-0032 AND HE HAD CONCLUDED TO DO SO WHILE I GREATLY REGRET TO LOSE YOU REPLIED THE GENERAL I BELIEVE YOU HAVE CHOSEN WELL TO ONE OF YOUR TEMPERAMENT SERVICE WITH MORGAN WILL BE MUCH MORE CONGENIAL THAN THE DUTIES OF A STAFF OFFICER IN FACT CONTINUED THE GENERAL
4719-25765-0033 WITH A SMILE I THINK YOU RESEMBLE MORGAN IN BEING RESTIVE UNDER ORDERS AND PREFER TO HAVE YOUR OWN WAY AND GO WHERE YOU PLEASE A COMMAND OR TWO OF PARTISAN RANGERS MAY DO BUT TOO MANY WOULD BE FATAL TO THE DISCIPLINE OF AN ARMY MORGAN MAY DO THE ENEMY A GREAT DEAL OF MISCHIEF
4719-25765-0034 BUT AFTER ALL THE FATE OF THE SOUTH MUST BE DECIDED BY HER GREAT ARMIES TRUE GENERAL REPLIED CALHOUN BUT IF MORGAN CAN KEEP THOUSANDS OF THE ENEMY IN THE REAR GUARDING THEIR COMMUNICATIONS THE GREAT ARMIES OF THE NORTH WILL BE DEPLETED BY THAT NUMBER THAT IS TRUE ALSO ANSWERED BEAUREGARD
4719-25765-0035 I HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM FOR A COLONELCY CONVEY TO HIM MY REGARDS AND TELL HIM I HEARTILY CONGRATULATE HIM UPON HIS LAST RECRUIT GENERAL BEAUREGARD'S KIND WORDS TOUCHED CALHOUN DEEPLY THANK YOU GENERAL HE REPLIED WITH FEELING
4719-25765-0036 I TRUST I SHALL NEVER PROVE MYSELF UNWORTHY OF YOUR GOOD OPINION MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND CROWN YOUR EFFORTS WITH VICTORY
4719-25765-0037 A MORE SUPERB BODY OF ROUGH RIDERS WAS NEVER FORMED CALHOUN WAS INTRODUCED TO THE OFFICERS OF THE SQUADRON AND WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS GOING BACK TO KENTUCKY TO RECRUIT FOR THE COMMAND ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE OFFICERS WONDERED WHY THEIR CHIEF HAD SELECTED ONE SO YOUNG THEY GAVE HIM A HEARTY WELCOME
4719-25765-0038 BUT WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS THE SON OF JUDGE PENNINGTON OF DANVILLE THAT HE HAD ALREADY WON RENOWN AS A DARING SCOUT AND HAD BEEN OFFERED A POSITION ON THE STAFF OF GENERAL BEAUREGARD THEIR WELCOME WAS DOUBLY ENTHUSIASTIC TO THIS WELCOME THERE WAS ONE EXCEPTION ONE OF MORGAN'S OFFICERS
4719-25765-0039 CAPTAIN P C CONWAY HAD APPLIED TO MORGAN FOR PERMISSION TO GO BACK TO KENTUCKY ON THIS SAME DUTY AND HAD BEEN REFUSED HE WAS A SHORT THICKSET RED FACED MAN WITH A VERY POMPOUS AIR HIS WEAKNESS WAS LIQUOR YET HE WAS A BRAVE EFFICIENT OFFICER WHAT HE CONSIDERED AN AFFRONT WAS NEVER FORGIVEN
4719-25765-0040 FOR HE WAS OF A REVENGEFUL DISPOSITION IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH HIS CHARACTER THAT HE SHOULD BECOME A MORTAL ENEMY OF CALHOUN WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED TO CALHOUN HE MERELY BOWED AND DID NOT OFFER TO GIVE HIS HAND I BELIEVE I HAVE HEARD OF CAPTAIN CONWAY SAID CALHOUN WITH A SMILE
4719-25765-0041 I HAVE HEARD A COUSIN OF MINE SPEAK OF HIM WHY YES SPOKE UP MORGAN WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE CAPTAIN LIEUTENANT PENNINGTON IS A COUSIN OF YOUR PARTICULAR FRIEND CAPTAIN FRED SHACKELFORD OF THE YANKEE ARMY CONWAY FAIRLY TURNED PURPLE WITH RAGE
4719-25765-0042 LIEUTENANT PENNINGTON HAS NO REASON TO BE PROUD OF HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THAT SNEAK AND SPY HE SNORTED I HAVE NO MORE REASON TO LOVE MY COUSIN THAN YOU REPLIED CALHOUN WITH SOME WARMTH HE MAY HAVE PLAYED THE SPY SO HAVE I BUT SNEAK HE IS NOT AND I WOULD THANK YOU NOT TO USE THE TERM AGAIN
4719-25765-0043 TRAITOR THOUGH HE IS TO THE SOUTH AND HIS NATIVE STATE CONWAY GLARED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN CALHOUN'S EYE WHICH TOLD HIM THAT IF HE REPEATED THE TERM IT MIGHT CAUSE TROUBLE SO HE SNAPPED WELL SPY AND TRAITOR
4719-25765-0044 WITH A FEARFUL OATH I WILL SEE THAT HE IS WITH THESE WORDS HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND STALKED AWAY SHACKELFORD'S NAME HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON CONWAY THAT A RED RAG HAS ON A MAD BULL LAUGHED MORGAN HE CAN NEVER FORGET THAT TRICK YOUR COUSIN PLAYED ON HIM
4719-25765-0045 AH I REMEMBER SAID CALHOUN FRED TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT CONWAY MAY TAKE A DISLIKE TO ME SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM FRED'S COUSIN I NOTICED THAT HE GREETED ME RATHER COLDLY I RECKON HE WILL NOT CARRY HIS HATRED SO FAR AS THAT REPLIED MORGAN
4719-25765-0046 BUT MORGAN MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND IF HE HAD HEARD CONWAY TALKING TO A BROTHER OFFICER JUST TO THINK HE FUMED
4719-25765-0047 I VOLUNTEERED TO GO YESTERDAY AND HE PUT ME DOWN TO MY MIND PENNINGTON IS NO BETTER THAN THAT SNEAK OF A COUSIN OF HIS AND MORGAN WILL FIND IT OUT SOME DAY
