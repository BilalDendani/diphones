5717-94876-0000 IT'S GETTING AWFUL ROUGH WALKING SAID DOROTHY AS THEY TRUDGED ALONG BUTTON BRIGHT GAVE A DEEP SIGH AND SAID HE WAS HUNGRY INDEED ALL WERE HUNGRY AND THIRSTY TOO FOR THEY HAD EATEN NOTHING BUT THE APPLES SINCE BREAKFAST
5717-94876-0001 SO THEIR STEPS LAGGED AND THEY GREW SILENT AND WEARY AT LAST THEY SLOWLY PASSED OVER THE CREST OF A BARREN HILL AND SAW BEFORE THEM A LINE OF GREEN TREES WITH A STRIP OF GRASS AT THEIR FEET
5717-94876-0002 AN AGREEABLE FRAGRANCE WAS WAFTED TOWARD THEM OUR TRAVELERS HOT AND TIRED RAN FORWARD ON BEHOLDING THIS REFRESHING SIGHT AND WERE NOT LONG IN COMING TO THE TREES HERE THEY FOUND A SPRING OF PURE BUBBLING WATER
5717-94876-0003 AROUND WHICH THE GRASS WAS FULL OF WILD STRAWBERRY PLANTS THEIR PRETTY RED BERRIES RIPE AND READY TO EAT SOME OF THE TREES BORE YELLOW ORANGES AND SOME RUSSET PEARS
5717-94876-0004 SO THE HUNGRY ADVENTURERS SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES PROVIDED WITH PLENTY TO EAT AND TO DRINK THEY LOST NO TIME IN PICKING THE BIGGEST STRAWBERRIES AND RIPEST ORANGES AND SOON HAD FEASTED TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT
5717-94876-0005 WALKING BEYOND THE LINE OF TREES THEY SAW BEFORE THEM A FEARFUL DISMAL DESERT EVERYWHERE GRAY SAND AT THE EDGE OF THIS AWFUL WASTE
5717-94876-0006 AND THE LETTERS MADE THESE WORDS ALL PERSONS ARE WARNED NOT TO VENTURE UPON THIS DESERT FOR THE DEADLY SANDS WILL TURN ANY LIVING FLESH TO DUST IN AN INSTANT
5717-94876-0007 BEYOND THIS BARRIER IS THE LAND OF OZ BUT NO ONE CAN REACH THAT BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THESE DESTROYING SANDS OH SAID DOROTHY WHEN THE SHAGGY MAN HAD READ THE SIGN ALOUD
5717-94876-0008 I'VE SEEN THIS DESERT BEFORE AND IT'S TRUE NO ONE CAN LIVE WHO TRIES TO WALK UPON THE SANDS THEN WE MUSN'T TRY IT ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN THOUGHTFULLY
5717-94876-0009 I WISH FATHER WOULD COME FOR ME SIGHED THE PRETTY RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER I WOULD TAKE YOU ALL TO LIVE UPON THE RAINBOW WHERE YOU COULD DANCE ALONG ITS RAYS FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT WITHOUT A CARE OR WORRY OF ANY SORT
5717-94876-0010 BUT I SUPPOSE FATHER'S TOO BUSY JUST NOW TO SEARCH THE WORLD FOR ME DON'T WANT TO DANCE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT SITTING DOWN WEARILY UPON THE SOFT GRASS IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU POLLY SAID DOROTHY
5717-94876-0011 BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD SUIT ME BETTER THAN DANCING ON RAINBOWS I'M FRAID THEY'D BE KIND OF SOFT AN SQUASHY UNDER FOOT ANYHOW ALTHOUGH THEY'RE SO PRETTY TO LOOK AT THIS DIDN'T HELP TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
5717-94876-0012 JUST AS IF HE COULD NOT TELL EITHER WHAT TO DO BUTTON BRIGHT GOT A STICK AND BEGAN TO DIG IN THE EARTH AND THE OTHERS WATCHED HIM FOR A WHILE IN DEEP THOUGHT FINALLY THE SHAGGY MAN SAID
5717-94876-0013 IT'S NEARLY EVENING NOW SO WE MAY AS WELL SLEEP IN THIS PRETTY PLACE AND GET RESTED PERHAPS BY MORNING WE CAN DECIDE WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE TO MAKE BEDS FOR THE CHILDREN
5717-94876-0014 LONG AFTER THE OTHERS WERE ASLEEP HOWEVER THE SHAGGY MAN SAT IN THE STARLIGHT BY THE SPRING GAZING THOUGHTFULLY INTO ITS BUBBLING WATERS SUDDENLY HE SMILED AND NODDED TO HIMSELF
5717-94876-0015 AS IF HE HAD FOUND A GOOD THOUGHT AFTER WHICH HE TOO LAID HIMSELF DOWN UNDER A TREE AND WAS SOON LOST IN SLUMBER IN THE BRIGHT MORNING SUNSHINE AS THEY ATE OF THE STRAWBERRIES AND SWEET JUICY PEARS DOROTHY SAID
5717-94876-0016 POLLY CAN YOU DO ANY MAGIC NO DEAR ANSWERED POLYCHROME SHAKING HER DAINTY HEAD YOU OUGHT TO KNOW SOME MAGIC BEING THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER CONTINUED DOROTHY EARNESTLY
5717-94876-0017 REPLIED POLYCHROME WHAT I'D LIKE SAID DOROTHY IS TO FIND SOME WAY TO CROSS THE DESERT TO THE LAND OF OZ AND ITS EMERALD CITY I'VE CROSSED IT ALREADY YOU KNOW MORE THAN ONCE FIRST A CYCLONE CARRIED MY HOUSE OVER
5717-94876-0018 AND SOME SILVER SHOES BROUGHT ME BACK AGAIN IN HALF A SECOND THEN OZMA TOOK ME OVER ON HER MAGIC CARPET AND THE NOME KING'S MAGIC BELT TOOK ME HOME THAT TIME
5717-94876-0019 AND WE CAN'T SPECT A CYCLONE TO HAPPEN ALONG AND TAKE US TO THE EMERALD CITY NOW NO INDEED RETURNED POLLY WITH A SHUDDER I HATE CYCLONES ANYWAY
5717-94876-0020 SAID THE LITTLE KANSAS GIRL I'M SURE I CAN'T AND I'M SURE BUTTON BRIGHT CAN'T AND THE ONLY MAGIC THE SHAGGY MAN HAS IS THE LOVE MAGNET WHICH WON'T HELP US MUCH DON'T BE TOO SURE OF THAT MY DEAR
5717-94876-0021 SPOKE THE SHAGGY MAN A SMILE ON HIS DONKEY FACE I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO MAGIC MYSELF BUT I CAN CALL TO US A POWERFUL FRIEND WHO LOVES ME BECAUSE I OWN THE LOVE MAGNET
5717-94876-0022 AND THIS FRIEND SURELY WILL BE ABLE TO HELP US WHO IS YOUR FRIEND ASKED DOROTHY
5717-94876-0023 WHAT CAN JOHNNY DO ANYTHING ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN WITH CONFIDENCE ASK HIM TO COME SHE EXCLAIMED EAGERLY THE SHAGGY MAN TOOK THE LOVE MAGNET FROM HIS POCKET AND UNWRAPPED THE PAPER THAT SURROUNDED IT
5717-94876-0024 HOLDING THE CHARM IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND HE LOOKED AT IT STEADILY AND SAID THESE WORDS DEAR JOHNNY DOOIT COME TO ME I NEED YOU BAD AS BAD CAN BE
5717-94876-0025 WELL HERE I AM SAID A CHEERY LITTLE VOICE BUT YOU SHOULDN'T SAY YOU NEED ME BAD CAUSE I'M ALWAYS ALWAYS GOOD AT THIS THEY QUICKLY WHIRLED AROUND TO FIND A FUNNY LITTLE MAN SITTING ON A BIG COPPER CHEST
5717-94876-0026 PUFFING SMOKE FROM A LONG PIPE HIS HAIR WAS GREY HIS WHISKERS WERE GREY AND THESE WHISKERS WERE SO LONG THAT HE HAD WOUND THE ENDS OF THEM AROUND HIS WAIST AND TIED THEM IN A HARD KNOT UNDERNEATH THE LEATHER APRON
5717-94876-0027 THAT REACHED FROM HIS CHIN NEARLY TO HIS FEET AND WHICH WAS SOILED AND SCRATCHED AS IF IT HAD BEEN USED A LONG TIME HIS NOSE WAS BROAD AND STUCK UP A LITTLE
5717-94876-0028 AND DOROTHY THOUGHT JOHNNY DOOIT LOOKED AS IF HE HAD DONE A LOT OF HARD WORK IN HIS LIFETIME GOOD MORNING JOHNNY SAID THE SHAGGY MAN THANK YOU FOR COMING TO ME SO QUICKLY I NEVER WASTE TIME SAID THE NEWCOMER PROMPTLY
5717-94876-0029 BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU WHERE DID YOU GET THAT DONKEY HEAD REALLY I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN YOU AT ALL SHAGGY MAN IF I HADN'T LOOKED AT YOUR FEET THE SHAGGY MAN INTRODUCED JOHNNY DOOIT TO DOROTHY AND TOTO AND BUTTON BRIGHT AND THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER
5717-94876-0030 AND TOLD HIM THE STORY OF THEIR ADVENTURES ADDING THAT THEY WERE ANXIOUS NOW TO REACH THE EMERALD CITY IN THE LAND OF OZ WHERE DOROTHY HAD FRIENDS WHO WOULD TAKE CARE OF THEM AND SEND THEM SAFE HOME AGAIN BUT
5717-94876-0031 SAID HE WE FIND THAT WE CAN'T CROSS THIS DESERT WHICH TURNS ALL LIVING FLESH THAT TOUCHES IT INTO DUST SO I HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME AND HELP US JOHNNY DOOIT PUFFED HIS PIPE
5717-94876-0032 YOU MUST RIDE HE SAID BRISKLY WHAT IN ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN IN A SAND BOAT WHICH HAS RUNNERS LIKE A SLED AND SAILS LIKE A SHIP THE WIND WILL BLOW YOU SWIFTLY ACROSS THE DESERT
5717-94876-0033 AND THE SAND CANNOT TOUCH YOUR FLESH TO TURN IT INTO DUST GOOD CRIED DOROTHY CLAPPING HER HANDS DELIGHTEDLY THAT WAS THE WAY THE MAGIC CARPET TOOK US ACROSS WE DIDN'T HAVE TO TOUCH THE HORRID SAND AT ALL
5717-94876-0034 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN LOOKING ALL AROUND HIM I'LL MAKE YOU ONE SAID JOHNNY DOOIT AS HE SPOKE
5717-94876-0035 HE KNOCKED THE ASHES FROM HIS PIPE AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET THEN HE UNLOCKED THE COPPER CHEST AND LIFTED THE LID AND DOROTHY SAW IT WAS FULL OF SHINING TOOLS OF ALL SORTS AND SHAPES JOHNNY DOOIT MOVED QUICKLY NOW
5717-94876-0036 SO QUICKLY THAT THEY WERE ASTONISHED AT THE WORK HE WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH HE HAD IN HIS CHEST A TOOL FOR EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO DO AND THESE MUST HAVE BEEN MAGIC TOOLS BECAUSE THEY DID THEIR WORK SO FAST AND SO WELL
5717-94876-0037 THE MAN HUMMED A LITTLE SONG AS HE WORKED AND DOROTHY TRIED TO LISTEN TO IT SHE THOUGHT THE WORDS WERE SOMETHING LIKE THESE
5717-94876-0038 WHATEVER JOHNNY DOOIT WAS SINGING HE WAS CERTAINLY DOING THINGS AND THEY ALL STOOD BY AND WATCHED HIM IN AMAZEMENT HE SEIZED AN AXE AND IN A COUPLE OF CHOPS FELLED A TREE
5717-94876-0039 NEXT HE TOOK A SAW AND IN A FEW MINUTES SAWED THE TREE TRUNK INTO BROAD LONG BOARDS HE THEN NAILED THE BOARDS TOGETHER INTO THE SHAPE OF A BOAT ABOUT TWELVE FEET LONG AND FOUR FEET WIDE
5717-94876-0040 HE CUT FROM ANOTHER TREE A LONG SLENDER POLE WHICH WHEN TRIMMED OF ITS BRANCHES AND FASTENED UPRIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE BOAT SERVED AS A MAST
5717-94876-0041 ARRANGING IT SO IT COULD BE RAISED OR LOWERED UPON THE MAST DOROTHY FAIRLY GASPED WITH WONDER TO SEE THE THING GROW SO SPEEDILY BEFORE HER EYES AND BOTH BUTTON BRIGHT AND POLLY LOOKED ON WITH THE SAME ABSORBED INTEREST
5717-94876-0042 IT OUGHT TO BE PAINTED SAID JOHNNY DOOIT TOSSING HIS TOOLS BACK INTO THE CHEST FOR THAT WOULD MAKE IT LOOK PRETTIER BUT THOUGH I CAN PAINT IT FOR YOU IN THREE SECONDS IT WOULD TAKE AN HOUR TO DRY AND THAT'S A WASTE OF TIME
5717-94876-0043 WE DON'T CARE HOW IT LOOKS SAID THE SHAGGY MAN IF ONLY IT WILL TAKE US ACROSS THE DESERT IT WILL DO THAT DECLARED JOHNNY DOOIT ALL YOU NEED WORRY ABOUT IS TIPPING OVER DID YOU EVER SAIL A SHIP
