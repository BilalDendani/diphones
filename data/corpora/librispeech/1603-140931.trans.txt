1603-140931-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN STRANGE TO SAY THE ANGER OF THE RATURANS WAS NOT ASSUAGED BY THE REBUFF WHICH THEY RECEIVED AT THAT TIME THEY TOOK COUNSEL AGAIN
1603-140931-0001 AND THEN ATTACK THEM WHEN OFF THEIR GUARD MEANWHILE ZEPPA
1603-140931-0002 THE DAY ON WHICH THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM OPENED HIS MOUTH AND GAVE FORTH THE FIRST NOTES OF A HYMN IN A FINE SONOROUS BASS VOICE THE CHILD GAZED AT HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN OPEN EYED WONDER AND THEN BURST INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE FIT OF OPEN MOUTHED LAUGHTER
1603-140931-0003 THIS GAZE WAS EVIDENTLY REGARDED BY LIPPY AS AN ADDITIONAL TOUCH OF HUMOUR FOR SHE WENT OFF INTO RENEWED EXPLOSIONS OF DELIGHT AND THE LESSON HAD TO BE GIVEN UP FOR THAT TIME ZEPPA WAS GIFTED HOWEVER WITH PATIENT PERSEVERANCE IN A REMARKABLE DEGREE
1603-140931-0004 SHE WENT WRONG IN ONE OR TWO NOTES HOWEVER WHICH GAVE ZEPPA THE OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING HER RIGHT HE TOOK HER ON HIS KNEE AND TOLD HER
1603-140931-0005 AND HER TEACHER GAZED AT HER WITH INTENSE PLEASURE DEPICTED ON HIS HANDSOME FACE UNTIL SHE REACHED THE NOTE
1603-140931-0006 NO NOT SO SING THUS HE SAID GIVING THE RIGHT NOTES THE PUPIL TOOK IT UP AT ONCE AND THUS THE SINGING LESSONS WERE FAIRLY BEGUN BUT THE MATTER DID NOT REST HERE FOR LIPPY PROUD OF HER NEW ACQUIREMENT
1603-140931-0007 SOON BEGAN TO EXHIBIT HER POWERS TO HER LITTLE COMPANIONS AND ERE LONG A FEW OF THE SMALLEST OF THESE VENTURED TO CREEP INTO ZEPPA'S HUT WHILE THE DAILY LESSON WAS GOING ON GRADUALLY THEY GREW BOLDER AND JOINED IN THE EXERCISE ZEPPA TOOK PLEASURE IN HELPING THEM
1603-140931-0008 AND AT LAST PERMITTED AS MANY AS COULD CROWD INTO HIS HUT TO DO SO THOSE WHO COULD NOT GET INSIDE SAT ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE AND AS THE HUT WAS OPEN IN FRONT THE GATHERING SOON INCREASED THUS INSENSIBLY WITHOUT A WELL DEFINED INTENTION OR EFFORT ON THE PART OF ANY ONE
1603-140931-0009 THE ASSEMBLING OF THESE CHILDREN FOR THEIR LESSON BROUGHT POWERFULLY TO ZEPPA'S MIND ONE DAY THE MEETINGS OF THE RATINGA PEOPLE FOR WORSHIP AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF BEGINNING WITH PRAYER OCCURRED TO HIM ACCORDINGLY THAT MORNING JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO COMMENCE THE HYMNS HE CLASPED HIS HANDS
1603-140931-0010 AND BRIEFLY ASKED GOD'S BLESSING ON THE WORK
1603-140931-0011 AND BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO RECOVER THE PRAYER WAS OVER ZEPPA'S MODE OF TERMINATING THE ASSEMBLY WAS CHARACTERISTIC HE DID NOT LIKE TO ORDER THE CHILDREN AWAY MUCH LESS TO PUT THEM OUT OF HIS HUT
1603-140931-0012 THEY FELT THAT NOTHING SHORT OF EXTERMINATION WOULD SUFFICE AND THEY WERE RIGHT EXTERMINATION OF THE SINNERS OR THE SINS WAS INDEED THEIR ONLY CHANCE OF PEACE NOT KNOWING THE GOSPEL METHOD OF BLOTTING OUT THE LATTER THEIR ONE RESOURCE LAY IN OBLITERATING THE FORMER
1603-140931-0013 UNTIL THE ENTIRE FORCE OF THE TRIBE WAS UNDER HIS COMMAND LEAVING THE AGED MEN AND BOYS TO PROTECT THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN THOSE DARK SKINNED WARRIORS MARCHED AWAY TO BATTLE NOT WITH THE FLAUNTING BANNERS AND MARTIAL MUSIC OF CIVILISED MAN BUT WITH THE PROFOUND SILENCE AND THE STEALTHY TREAD OF THE SAVAGE
1603-140931-0014 AND SPARE JAVELINS BUT BEING A NIGHT ATTACK THE FIGHTING MEN WENT ALONE EACH ARMED WITH A HEAVY CLUB A LIGHT SPEAR AND A STONE KNIFE OR HATCHET
1603-140931-0015 THE MAIN BODY WAS HALTED AND SCOUTS WERE SENT OUT IN ADVANCE TO SEE THAT ALL WAS CLEAR THEN THE PLAN OF ATTACK WAS FORMED ONE DETACHMENT WAS TO APPROACH THE ENEMY'S VILLAGE ON THE RIGHT
1603-140931-0016 THERE IS A PROVERB RELATING TO THE PLANS OF MEN AS WELL AS MICE WHICH RECEIVES VERIFICATION IN EVERY LAND AND TIME ITS TRUTH RECEIVED CORROBORATION AT THIS TIME ON SUGAR LOAF ISLAND ON THAT SAME NIGHT IT CHANCED THAT THE CHIEF ONGOLOO WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP
1603-140931-0017 HE SENT FOR HIS PRIME MINISTERIAL JESTER AND ONE OF HIS CHIEFS TO WHOM HE PROPOSED A RAMBLE THE CHIEF AND JESTER PROFESSED THEMSELVES CHARMED WITH THE PROPOSAL ALTHOUGH EACH HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM A PLEASANT SLUMBER IN THE COURSE OF THE RAMBLE THEY CAME UNEXPECTEDLY ON ONE OF THE RATURAN SCOUTS
1603-140931-0018 WHOM THEY TEMPORARILY EXTINGUISHED WITH A CLUB ONGOLOO BECAME AT ONCE ALIVE TO THE SITUATION AND TOOK INSTANT ACTION WAPOOTA HE SAID IN AN EXCITED WHISPER RUN TO THE REAR OF THE FOE GO SWIFTLY LIKE THE SEA BIRD WHEN YOU GET THERE YELL SHRIEK LIKE LIKE YOU KNOW HOW
1603-140931-0019 AS YOU DID LAST TIME CHANGE YOUR GROUND AT EACH YELL SO THEY WILL THINK YOU A HOST FEAR NOT TO BE CAPTURED YOUR DEATH IS NOTHING AWAY A KICK FACILITATED WAPOOTA'S FLIGHT AND THE TWO CHIEFS RETURNED AT SPEED TO ROUSE THE SLEEPING CAMP WAPOOTA PERFORMED HIS PART NOBLY
1603-140931-0020 AND WITHOUT BEING CAPTURED FOR HE DID NOT AGREE WITH ONGOLOO AS TO THE UNIMPORTANCE OF HIS OWN DEATH AT THE UNEXPECTED OUTCRY IN THE REAR THE RATURANS HALTED AND HELD A HASTY COUNCIL OF WAR LET US GO BACK AND FIGHT THEM SAID ONE NO USE THEY ARE EVIL SPIRITS NOT MEN SAID ANOTHER
1603-140931-0021 WHILE WE WASTE TIME HERE SAID THE LEADING CHIEF THE MOUNTAIN DOGS WILL GET READY FOR US COME FORWARD THE CHIEF WAS RIGHT ONGOLOO'S RUSE CAUSED DELAY SO THAT WHEN THE RATURANS REACHED THE VILLAGE THEY FOUND ARMED MEN READY TO RECEIVE THEM
1603-140931-0022 THE WOMEN SCATTERED AND FLED THE SAVAGE WARRIORS PURSUED
1603-140931-0023 ALTHOUGH HE HAD REFUSED TO GO OUT TO WAR WITH HIS ENTERTAINERS HE FELT NO DISPOSITION TO STAND IDLY BY WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED DISORDERED THOUGH HIS MIND WAS HE COULD MAKE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN AGGRESSIVE WAR AND SELF DEFENCE
1603-140931-0024 AS THE TIDE OF BATTLE FLOWED AND VICTORY LEANED SOMETIMES TO ONE SIDE SOMETIMES TO THE OTHER ZEPPA WAS UNARMED AS HE DREW NEAR HE WAS OBSERVED BY BOTH PARTIES TO STOP ABRUPTLY IN HIS CAREER AND WRENCH OUT OF THE GROUND A STAKE
1603-140931-0025 THAT HAD BEEN MEANT FOR THE CORNER POST OF A NEWLY BEGUN HUT IT RESEMBLED THE GREAT CLUB OF HERCULES RATHER THAN A WEAPON OF MODERN MAN WHIRLING IT LIKE A FEATHER ROUND HIS HEAD THE MANIAC RUSHED ON HE WAS THOROUGHLY ROUSED A FEELING OF DESPERATE ANXIETY COUPLED WITH A SENSE OF HORRIBLE INJUSTICE
1603-140931-0026 HAD SET HIS SPIRIT IN A BLAZE HIS GREAT SIZE WHICH BECAME MORE APPARENT AS HE ADVANCED HIS FLASHING EYES COMPRESSED LIPS
1603-140931-0027 GAVE HIM ALTOGETHER AN ASPECT SO TERRIBLE
1603-140931-0028 THE RATURANS COULD NOT STAND IT BUT TURNED AND FLED IN A BODY UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS MORE THAN HUMAN HE WAS TOO FLEET FOR THEM HOWEVER OVERTAKING A FLYING KNOT
1603-140931-0029 THEN HURLING THE MIGHTY CLUB AWAY AS IF IT WERE A MERE HINDRANCE TO HIM HE RAN STRAIGHT AT THE LEADER OF THE RATURANS WHO BEING HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE HIS FELLOWS SEEMED A SUITABLE FOE TO SINGLE OUT BEFORE REACHING HIM HOWEVER
1603-140931-0030 WHO WAS HARD PRESSED AT THE TIME BY A CROWD OF OPPONENTS ONE ROAR FROM THE MANIAC SENT THESE FLYING LIKE CHAFF BEFORE THE WIND IT MUST BE ADDED HOWEVER FOR THE CREDIT OF THE MEN OF RATURA THAT ONGOLOO AND HIS WARRIORS HAD BACKED UP THEIR NEW LEADER GALLANTLY
1603-140931-0031 RAN WITH HIM AT RACING SPEED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RATURAN VILLAGES
1603-140931-0032 BUT IF IT HAD BEEN THIRTY HUNDRED IT WOULD HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECT OF ZEPPA'S ROAR AND ASPECT AS HE RUSHED UPON THEM WITH OBVIOUSLY AWFUL INTENTIONS THOUGH WITHOUT ARMS IN FACT THE LATTER CIRCUMSTANCE TENDED RATHER TO INCREASE THE FEARS OF THE SUPERSTITIOUS NATIVES
1603-140931-0033 THEY FLED AS ONE MAN AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF THE MANIAC AND LIPPY WAS RECOVERED INSTANTLY ZEPPA'S FEROCITY VANISHED AND THE TENDEREST OF SMILES RIPPLED OVER HIS FACE AS HE TOOK THE CHILD IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HER BUT WAPOOTA DID NOT FEEL QUITE SO EASY
1603-140931-0034 BUT THEY DID NOT AS IN FORMER TIMES RETURN TO SLAY THE AGED AND CARRY THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN INTO CAPTIVITY TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL HIS FOLLOWERS AND THE ANGER OF NOT A FEW ONGOLOO COMMANDED HIS MEN TO RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGE AND LEAVE THE RATURANS ALONE ONE OF HIS CHIEFS
1603-140931-0035 WHO SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO RESIST HIS AUTHORITY HE PROMPTLY KNOCKED DOWN WHEREUPON THE REST BECAME OBEDIENT AND WENT QUIETLY HOME ON REACHING THE VILLAGE ZEPPA WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS HUT WITH LIPPY ON HIS SHOULDER APPARENTLY HE HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE RECENT FIGHT FOR WITHOUT EVEN WAITING TO TAKE FOOD OR REST
1603-140931-0036 WHO FELT THAT SHE WAS ONLY RECEIVING HER DUE THE CHILD ACCEPTED THE ATTENTION HER YOUNG COMPANIONS ATTRACTED BY THE SWEET SOUNDS SOON FLOCKED TO THE OLD PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS AND WHEN THE LAST OF THE STRAGGLING WARRIORS RETURNED FROM THE FIELD OF BATTLE THEY FOUND THE SINGING CLASS GOING FULL SWING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
1603-140931-0037 OTHER SOUNDS BEGAN TO ARISE SOUNDS OF WAILING AND WOE WHICH SOON DROWNED THE HYMNS OF PRAISE AS SOON AS ZEPPA BECAME FULLY ALIVE TO THIS FACT
1603-140931-0038 AND PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS BROW AS IF TO CLEAR AWAY SOME MISTY CLOUDS THAT RESTED THERE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS SHATTERED INTELLECT HAD TAKEN IN A VERY IMPERFECT IMPRESSION OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED AS IF TO GET RID OF THIS BECLOUDED STATE HE STARTED OFF THAT EVENING AT A QUICK WALK
1603-140931-0039 NO ONE EVER FOLLOWED HIM ON THESE OCCASIONS THE NATIVES REGARDED HIS PERSON AS IN SOME MEASURE SACRED AND WOULD HAVE DEEMED IT NOT ONLY DANGEROUS BUT INSOLENT TO GO UP AMONG THE ROCKY HEIGHTS WHEN THE MADMAN WAS KNOWN TO BE THERE ONCE INDEED WAPOOTA
1603-140931-0040 WITH THAT PRESUMPTUOUS TEMERITY WHICH IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF FOOLS IN GENERAL VENTURED ON THE STRENGTH OF OLD ACQUAINTANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND EVEN WENT TOWARDS THE WELL KNOWN CAVE WHERE HE HAD FOUND REFUGE AND PROTECTION IN THE DAY OF HIS DISTRESS
1603-140931-0041 BUT ZEPPA HAD EITHER FORGOTTEN HIS FORMER INTERCOURSE WITH THE JESTER OR INTENDED TO REPUDIATE THE CONNECTION FOR HE DID NOT RECEIVE HIM KINDLY ON THE WAY UP WAPOOTA WHO FELT SOMEWHAT TIMOROUS ABOUT THE VISIT
1603-140931-0042 HAD MADE UP HIS MIND AS TO THE BEST MODE OF ADDRESS WITH WHICH TO APPROACH HIS FRIEND HE HAD DECIDED THAT ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY YOUTHFUL THE LANGUAGE AND MANNER OF A RESPECTFUL SON TO A REVERED FATHER WOULD BEST BEFIT THE OCCASION
1603-140931-0043 HE ASSUMED A STOOPING ATTITUDE OF PROFOUND RESPECT AND DREW NEAR ZEPPA LOOKED UP WITH A FROWN AS IF ANNOYED AT THE INTRUSION YOUR UNWORTHY SON BEGAN WAPOOTA COMES TO BUT HE GOT NO FURTHER HE COULD NOT WELL HAVE HIT UPON A MORE UNFORTUNATE PHRASE
1603-140931-0044 AND SAW THE MANIAC BOUND OVER THE FIRE TOWARDS HIM BUT HE SAW AND HEARD NO MORE FOR HIS LIMBS BECAME SUDDENLY ENDUED WITH SOMETHING LIKE ELECTRIC VITALITY HE TURNED AND SHOT OVER A SMALL PRECIPICE AS IF FLUNG FROM AN ANCIENT CATAPULT WHAT HE ALIGHTED ON HE DID NOT KNOW STILL LESS DID HE CARE
1603-140931-0045 AND INTENSIFIED THE ELECTRIC BATTERY WITHIN HIM HE WENT DOWN THE SLOPES REGARDLESS OF GRADIENT AT A PACE THAT MIGHT HAVE LEFT EVEN ZEPPA BEHIND IF HE HAD FOLLOWED BUT ZEPPA DID NOT FOLLOW WHEN WAPOOTA WENT OVER THE PRECIPICE AND DISAPPEARED ZEPPA HALTED AND STOOD ERECT
