4111-184447-0000 X WORKS ITSELF OUT INTO PERFECTLY GOOD SENSE
4111-184447-0001 MOLLY CARTER SAID MISSUS JOHNSON JUST DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY AFTER THE WHITE DRESS JUDGE WADE EPISODE THAT AUNT ADELINE HAD GONE TO ALL THE FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE STREET TO BE CONSOLED ABOUT
4111-184447-0002 IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT SENSE ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENT BLISSFUL CONDITION SOMEBODY OUGHT TO OPERATE ON YOUR MIND I WAS TEMPTED TO SAY WHY NOT MY HEART
4111-184447-0003 I WAS GLAD SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW GOOD THAT HEART DID FEEL UNDER MY BLOUSE WHEN THE BOY BROUGHT THAT BASKET OF FISH FROM JUDGE WADE'S FISHING EXPEDITION SATURDAY I HAVE FIRMLY DETERMINED NOT TO BLUSH ANY MORE AT THE THOUGHT OF THAT GORGEOUS MAN
4111-184447-0004 AT LEAST OUTWARDLY DON'T YOU THINK IT IS VERY VERY LONELY TO BE A WIDOW MISSUS JOHNSON I ASKED TIMIDLY TO SEE WHAT SHE WOULD SAY ABOUT MISTER JOHNSON WHO IS REALLY A KIND HEARTED SORT OF MAN I THINK
4111-184447-0005 LONELY LONELY MOLLY YOU TALK ABOUT THE MARRIED STATE EXACTLY LIKE AN OLD MAID DON'T DO IT IT'S FOOLISH AND YOU WILL GET THE LONE NOTION REALLY FASTENED IN YOUR MIND AND LET SOME MAN FIND OUT THAT IS HOW YOU FEEL
4111-184447-0006 I HAVE ONLY ONE REGRET AND IT IS THAT IF I EVER SHOULD BE A WIDOW MISTER JOHNSON WOULDN'T BE HERE TO SEE HOW QUICKLY I TURNED INTO AN OLD MAID
4111-184447-0007 AND AS SHE TALKED SHE WAS MENDING THE SLEEVE OF MISTER JOHNSON'S LOUNGE COAT I THINK AN OLD MAID IS JUST A WOMAN WHO HAS NEVER BEEN IN LOVE WITH A MAN WHO LOVES HER LOTS OF THEM HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR YEARS I SAID
4111-184447-0008 JUST AS INNOCENTLY AS THE SOFT FACE OF A PAN OF CREAM AND WENT ON DARNING ONE OF BILLY'S SOCKS WELL BE THAT AS IT MAY THEY ARE THE BLESSED MEMBERS OF THE WOMEN TRIBE SHE ANSWERED LOOKING AT ME SHARPLY
4111-184447-0009 NOW I HAVE OFTEN TOLD MISTER JOHNSON BUT HERE WE WERE INTERRUPTED IN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE REHEARSAL OF A GLORIOUS SCRAP BY THE APPEARANCE OF AUNT BETTIE POLLARD AND WITH HER CAME A LONG TALL LOVELY VISION OF A WOMAN IN THE MOST WONDERFUL
4111-184447-0010 CLOSE CLINGY DRESS AND HAT THAT YOU WANTED TO EAT THE MINUTE YOU SAW IT I HATED HER INSTANTLY WITH THE MOST INTENSE ADORATION THAT MADE ME WANT TO LIE DOWN AT HER FEET
4111-184447-0011 AND ALSO MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH I HAD GAINED ALL THE MORE THAN TWENTY POUNDS THAT I HAVE SLAVED OFF ME AND DOUBLED THEM ON AGAIN I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LEAD HER THAT MINUTE INTO DOCTOR JOHN'S OFFICE AND JUST TO HAVE LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID ONE WORD
4111-184447-0012 SCARLET RUNNER AUNT BETTY INTRODUCED HER AS MISS CLINTON FROM LONDON OH MY DEAR MISSUS CARTER HOW GLAD I AM TO MEET YOU SHE SAID AS SHE TOWERED OVER ME IN A WILLOWY WAY AND HER VOICE WAS LOVELY AND COOL ALMOST TO SLIMNESS
4111-184447-0013 HE CAME DOWN TO CHERBOURG TO SEE ME OFF AND ALMOST THE LAST THING HE SAID TO ME WAS NOW DON'T FAIL TO SEE MISSUS CARTER AS SOON AS YOU GET TO HILLSBORO AND THE MORE YOU SEE OF HER THE MORE YOU'LL ENJOY YOUR VISIT TO MISSUS POLLARD
4111-184447-0014 ISN'T HE THE MOST DELIGHTFUL OF MEN SHE ASKED ME THE QUESTION BUT SHE HAD THE MOST WONDERFUL WAY OF SEEMING TO BE TALKING TO EVERYBODY AT ONE TIME SO MISSUS JOHNSON GOT IN THE FIRST ANSWER DELIGHTFUL INDEED
4111-184447-0015 BUT ALFRED BENNETT IS A MAN OF SENSE NOT TO MARRY ANY OF THE STRING OF WOMEN WHO I SUPPOSE ARE RUNNING AFTER HIM SHE SAID MISS CLINTON LOOKED AT HER IN A MILD KIND OF WONDER BUT SHE WENT ON HACKING MISTER JOHNSON'S COAT SLEEVE WITH THE NEEDLE WITHOUT NOTICING THE GLANCE AT ALL
4111-184447-0016 WELL WELL DEARIE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
4111-184447-0017 BIG DARLING FAT SELF IN THE STRONG ROCKING CHAIR I ALWAYS KEPT FOR HER ALFRED IS NOT OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE PROVED HIMSELF ENTIRELY AND FROM WHAT I HEAR SHE PAUSED WITH THE BIG HEARTY SMILE THAT SHE ALWAYS WEARS WHEN SHE BEGINS TO TEASE OR MATCH MAKE
4111-184447-0018 AND SHE DOES THEM BOTH MOST OF HER TIME BUT AT WHOM DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE LOOKED NOT ME MISS CLINTON THAT WAS COLD TUB NUMBER TWO FOR THAT DAY AND I DIDN'T REACT AS QUICKLY AS I MIGHT
4111-184447-0019 BUT WHEN I DID I WAS IN THE PROPER GLOW ALL OVER WHEN I REVIVED AND SAW THE LOVELY PALE BLUSH ON HER FACE I FELT LIKE A CABBAGE ROSE BESIDE A TEA BUD I WAS GLAD AUNT ADELINE CAME IN JUST THEN SO I COULD GO IN AND TELL JULIA TO BRING OUT THE TEA AND CAKES
4111-184447-0020 AND PUT MY FINGER DOWN ON A LINE WITH MY EYES SHUT THIS WAS WHAT IT WAS AND ALL THESE YEARS I HAVE WALKED THE WORLD BLINDFOLDED TO ITS LOVELINESS WITH THE BLACKNESS THAT CAME TO ME WHEN I FOUND THAT YOU
4111-184447-0021 I DIDN'T READ ANY MORE BUT PUSHED IT BACK IN A HURRY AND WENT BACK TO THE COMPANY COMFORTED IN A WAY
4111-184447-0022 BUT FEELING A LITTLE MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH MISSUS JOHNSON THAN I HAD BEFORE AUNT BETTIE AND HER GUEST FROM LONDON HAD INTERRUPTED OUR ALGEBRAIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE MAN SUBJECT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS BE SURE OF THE RIGHT ANSWER TO X IN ANY PROPOSITION OF LIFE
4111-184447-0023 THAT IS A WOMAN CAN'T AND FURTHERMORE I DIDN'T LIKE THAT NEXT HOUR MUCH JUST AS A SAMPLE OF LIFE FOR INSTANCE AUNT BETTIE HAD GOT HER JOINING TOGETHER HUMOUR WELL STARTED AND THERE BEFORE MY FACE SHE MADE A PRESENT OF
4111-184447-0024 EVERY NICE MAN IN HILLSBORO TO THAT LOVELY DISTINGUISHED STRANGE GIRL WHO COULD HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH A BUCKET HOOP IF SHE HAD TRIED HARD I HAD TO SIT THERE LISTEN TO THE PRESENTATIONS
4111-184447-0025 WATCH HER DRINK TWO DELICIOUS CUPS OF TEA FULL OF SUGAR AND CREAM AND CONSUME WITHOUT FEAR THREE OF JANE'S PUFFY CAKES WHILE I CRUMBLED MINE IN SECRET AND SET HALF THE CUP OF TEA OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND A FERN POT
4111-184447-0026 IT WAS BAD ENOUGH TO HEAR AUNT BETTIE JUST OFFER HER TOM WHO IF HE IS HER OWN SON IS MY FAVOURITE COUSIN BUT I BELIEVE THE WORST MINUTE I ALMOST EVER FACED WAS WHEN SHE BEGAN ON THE JUDGE
4111-184447-0027 FOR I COULD SEE FROM AUNT ADELINE'S SHOULDER BEYOND MISS CLINTON HOW SHE WAS ENJOYING THAT AND SHE ADDED ANOTHER DISTINGUISHED ANCESTOR TO HIS PEDIGREE EVERY TIME AUNT BETTIE PAUSED FOR BREATH I COULDN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT THE FISH AND AUNT ADELINE WOULDN'T
4111-184447-0028 I ALMOST LOVED MISSUS JOHNSON WHEN SHE BIT OFF A THREAD VICIOUSLY AND SAID HUMPH AS SHE ROSE TO START THE TEA PARTY HOME
4111-184447-0029 I FELT TERRIBLY OLD AND UGLY AND DOWDY AND
4111-184447-0030 FOR I JUST LOVE THAT GIRL I WANT MOST AWFULLY TO HUG HER VERY SLIMNESS AND IT WAS MORE WHAT SHE MIGHT THINK OF POOR DUMPY ME THAN WHAT ANY MAN IN HILLSBORO OR PARIS COULD POSSIBLY FEEL ON THE SUBJECT THAT HURT SO HARD
4111-184447-0031 FOR SOMETHING MADE ME SIT UP SUDDENLY WITH A SPARK IN MY EYES AND REACH OUT TO THE DESK FOR MY PENCIL AND CHEQUE BOOK IT TOOK ME MORE THAN AN HOUR TO RECKON IT ALL UP BUT I WENT TO BED A HAPPIER THOUGH IN PROSPECTS A POORER WOMAN
4111-184447-0032 AS I SAT IN THE TRAIN ON MY WAY TO TOWN EARLY THE NEXT MORNING I THOUGHT A GOOD DEAL ABOUT POOR MISTER CARTER AFTER THIS I SHALL ALWAYS APPRECIATE AND ADMIRE HIM FOR THE WAY HE MADE MONEY AND HIS KINDNESS IN LEAVING IT TO ME SINCE
4111-184447-0033 AND I BOUGHT THINGS
4111-184447-0034 I HAD HEARD ABOUT HER AND I KNEW IT MEANT A FORTUNE BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER SHE CAME IN AND LOOKED AT ME FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT SAYING A WORD AND THEN SHE RAN HER HANDS DOWN AND DOWN OVER ME UNTIL I COULD FEEL THE SUPERFLUOUS FLESH JUST
4111-184447-0035 WALKING OFF OF ME IT WAS DELICIOUS THEN SHE AND TWO GIRLS WEARING FASHIONABLE FROCKS AND FASHIONABLE HAIR CAME IN AND DID THINGS TO A CORSET THEY LACED ON ME THAT I CAN'T EVEN WRITE DOWN FOR I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS
4111-184447-0036 I WASN'T TIGHT AND I WASN'T STIFF AND I LOOKED
4111-184447-0037 I WAS SPELLBOUND WITH DELIGHT
4111-184447-0038 BUT I CAME TO WITH A JOLT WHEN THE PRETTIEST GIRL BEGAN TO GET ME INTO THAT BLACK SILK BAG I HAD WORN DOWN TO THE WEST END I MUST HAVE SHRUNK THE WHOLE REMAINING POUNDS I HAD FELT OBLIGED TO LOSE FOR ALFRED AND RUTH CLINTON FROM THE HORROR I FELT WHEN I LOOKED AT MYSELF
4111-184447-0039 SHALL I CALL A TAXI FOR MADAME AND HAVE IT TAKE HER TO KLEIN'S
4111-184447-0040 MEN DO BUSINESS WELL BUT WHEN WOMEN ENTER THE FIELD THEY ARE GENIUSES AT MONEY EXTRACTING I FELT MYSELF ALREADY CLOTHED PERFECTLY WHEN THAT GIRL SAID MY FIGURE COMMANDED A PROPER DRESS
4111-184447-0041 OF COURSE KLEIN PAYS MADAME COURTIER A COMMISSION FOR THE CUSTOMERS SHE PASSES ON TO HIM THE ONE FOR ME MUST HAVE LOOKED TO HER LIKE A BIG TRANSACTION
4111-184447-0042 ONLY GOING TO THE HOTEL TO SLEEP AND MOST OF THE TIME I FORGOT TO EAT MADAME RENE MUST HAVE BEEN MADAME COURTIER'S TWIN SISTER IN YOUTH AND MADAME TELLIERS IN THE HAT DEPARTMENT WAS THE TRIPLET TO THEM BOTH
4111-184447-0043 WHEN WOMEN HAVE GENIUS IT BREAKS OUT ALL OVER THEM LIKE MEASLES AND THEY NEVER RECOVER FROM IT THOSE WOMEN HAD THE CONFLUENT KIND BUT I KNOW THAT MADAME RENE REALLY APPROVED OF ME
4111-184447-0044 FOR WHEN I BLUSHED AND ASKED HER IF SHE COULD RECOMMEND A GOOD BEAUTY DOCTOR SHE HELD UP HER HANDS AND SHUDDERED NEVER MADAME NEVER POUR VOUS
4111-184447-0045 I THOUGHT KLEIN WAS GOING TO DO THE SAME THING OR WORSE WHEN I SIGNED THE CHEQUE WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE HIM WITH A NEW MOTOR CAR BUT HE DIDN'T HE ONLY SAID POLITELY AND I AM DELIGHTED THAT THE TROUSSEAU IS PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY TO YOU MADAME
4111-184447-0046 THAT WAS AN AWFUL SHOCK AND I HOPE I DIDN'T SHOW IT AS I MURMURED PERFECTLY THANK YOU THE WORD TROUSSEAU CAN BE SPOKEN IN A WOMAN'S PRESENCE FOR MANY YEARS WITH NO EFFECT BUT IT IS AN AWFUL SHOCK WHEN SHE FIRST REALLY HEARS IT
4111-184447-0047 I FELT QUEER ALL THE AFTERNOON AS I PACKED THOSE TRUNKS FOR THE FIVE O'CLOCK TRAIN YES THE WORD TROUSSEAU OUGHT TO HAVE A DEFINITE SURNAME AFTER IT ALWAYS AND THAT'S WHY MY LOYALTY DRAGGED POOR MISTER CARTER OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF MY CONSCIENCE
4111-184447-0048 I HAD LAID OUT THE DREAM IN DARK GREY BLUE CLOTH TAILORED ALMOST BEYOND ENDURANCE TO WEAR IN THE TRAIN GOING HOME AND HAD THROWN THE OLD BLACK SILK BAG ACROSS THE CHAIR TO GIVE TO THE HOTEL MAID
4111-184447-0049 BUT THE DECISION OF THE SESSION BETWEEN CONSCIENCE AND LOYALTY MADE ME PACK THE PRECIOUS BLUE WONDER AND PUT ON ONCE MORE THE BLACK RAGS OF REMEMBRANCE IN A KIND OF PANIC OF RESPECT I WOULD LOTS RATHER HAVE BOUGHT POOR MISTER CARTER THE MONUMENT I HAVE BEEN PLANNING FOR MONTHS
4111-184447-0050 TO KEEP UP CONVERSATION WITH AUNT ADELINE THAN WEAR THAT DRESS AGAIN
4111-184447-0051 BECAUSE I REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE STAYED A DAY LONGER TO BUY THAT MONUMENT BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH I WANTED TO SEE BILLY SO DESPERATELY THAT HIS SLEEP PLACE ABOVE MY HEART HURT AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE PRICKLY HEAT BREAK OUT AT ANY MINUTE
4111-184447-0052 SO I HURRIED AND STUFFED THE GREY BLUE DARLING IN THE TOP TRAY
4111-184447-0053 DOWN TO THE BUTCHER'S IN THE HIGH STREET I SUPPOSE THAT IS ABOUT THE ONLY MORNING DISSIPATION IN HILLSBORO THAT I CAN THINK OF AND IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHOM YOU MEET HOW MUCH OF A DISSIPATION IT IS
4111-184447-0054 THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU HAVE DONE A NOBLE DEED IS YOU EITHER REGARD IT AS A REWARD OF VIRTUE OR AS A PUNISHMENT FOR HAVING BEEN FOOLISH I FELT BOTH WAYS WHEN JUDGE WADE CAME DOWN THE PLATFORM AT SAINT PANCRAS
4111-184447-0055 LOOKING SO MUCH GRANDER THAN ANY OTHER MAN IN SIGHT THAT I DON'T SEE HOW THEY EVER STAND HIM AT THAT MINUTE THE NOBLE BLACK SILK DEED FELT FOOLISH BUT AT THE NEXT MINUTE I WAS GLAD I HAD DONE IT
4111-184447-0056 IT IS NICE TO WATCH FOR A PERSON TO CATCH SIGHT OF YOU IF YOU FEEL SURE HOW THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE IT AND SOMEHOW IN THIS CASE I FELT SURE I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED FOR HIS SMILE BROKE HIS FACE UP INTO A JOY LAUGH
4111-184447-0057 OFF CAME HIS HAT INSTANTLY SO I COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE FASCINATING FROST OVER HIS TEMPLES AND WITH A POSITIVE SIGH OF PLEASURE HE GOT INTO THE SAME CARRIAGE AND TOOK A SEAT BESIDE ME I TURNED WITH AN ECHO SMILE ALL OVER ME
4111-184447-0058 MISSUS CARTER HE SAID VERY KINDLY IN A VOICE THAT PITCHED ME OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND LEFT ME A MILE BEHIND ON THE RAILS ALL BY MYSELF I WISH I HAD KNOWN OF YOUR SAD ERRAND TO TOWN
4111-184447-0059 SO THAT I COULD HAVE OFFERED YOU SOME ASSISTANCE IN YOUR SELECTION YOU KNOW WE HAVE JUST HAD OUR FAMILY GRAVE IN THE CEMETERY FINALLY ARRANGED AND I FOUND THE DEALERS IN MEMORIAL STONES VERY CONFUSING IN THEIR IDEAS AND DESIGNS
4111-184447-0060 MISSUS HENDERSON JUST TOLD MY MOTHER OF YOUR ABSENCE FROM HOME LAST NIGHT AND I COULD ONLY COME UP TO TOWN FOR THE DAY ON IMPORTANT BUSINESS OR I WOULD HAVE ARRANGED TO SEE YOU I HOPE YOU FOUND SOMETHING THAT SATISFIED YOU
4111-184447-0061 WHAT IS A WOMAN GOING TO SAY WHEN SHE HAS A TOMBSTONE THROWN IN HER FACE LIKE THAT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BUT WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT AUNT ADELINE FILLED IN A DREADFUL PAUSE
4111-184447-0062 PERFECTLY DUMB AND QUIET I SAT FOR A SPACE OF TIME AND WONDERED JUST WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IT WAS BEYOND ME AT THE MOMENT AND THE MOLLY THAT IS READY FOR LIFE QUICK DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY I SHUT MY EYES
4111-184447-0063 COUNTED THREE TO MYSELF AS I DO WHEN I GO OVER INTO THE COLD TUB AND THEN TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT IT WE BOTH GOT A SATISFACTORY REACTION AND I NEVER ENJOYED MYSELF SO MUCH AS THAT BEFORE
4111-184447-0064 I UNDERSTAND NOW WHY JUDGE WADE HAS HAD SO MANY WOMEN MARTYR THEMSELVES OVER HIM AND LIVE UNHAPPILY EVER AFTERWARD AS EVERYBODY SAYS HENRIETTA MASON IS DOING HE'S A VERY INSPIRING MAN AND HE FAIRLY BRISTLES WITH FASCINATIONS
4111-184447-0065 WHILE OTHERS ARE DRAWING AND AFTER YOU ARE DRAWN TO THEM THEY WILL CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF TAKING YOU THE JUDGE IS LIKE THAT
4111-184447-0066 I MAY GET HURT BUT I SHALL AT LEAST HAVE ONLY MYSELF TO THANK FOR IT WHEN WE REACHED HOME THE JUDGE STOPPED UNDER THE OLD LILAC BUSH THAT LEANS OVER MY SIDE GATE AND KISSED MY HAND
4111-184447-0067 OLD LILAC SHOOK A LAUGH OF PERFUME ALL OVER US AND I BELIEVE SIGNALLED THE EVENT WITH THE TOP OF HIS BOUGH TO THE WHITE CLUMP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GARDEN I'M GLAD AUNT ADELINE ISN'T IN THE FLOWER FRATERNITY SUPPOSE SHE HAD SEEN OR HEARD
4111-184447-0068 ALSO FOR THE LAST TIME INSIDE OF THOSE BUTTONS AND RUN THROUGH THE GARDEN MY HEART SINGING BILLY BILLY IN A PERFECT RAPTURE OF TUNE I RAN PAST THE SURGERY DOOR AND FOUND HIM IN HIS COT ALMOST ASLEEP
4111-184447-0069 AND WE HAD A BEAR REUNION IN THE WICKER CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THAT MADE US BOTH BREATHLESS WHAT DID YOU BRING ME MOLLY HE FINALLY KISSED UNDER MY RIGHT EAR A REAL CRICKET BALL AND BAT LOVER AND AN ENGINE WITH FIVE CARRIAGES
4111-184447-0070 A RAKE AND A SPADE AND A HOE TWO GUNS THAT POP A NEW WAY AND SOMETHING THAT SQUIRTS WATER AND SOME OTHER THINGS WILL THAT BE ENOUGH
4111-184447-0071 AND I MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT THE VERY THING HE WANTED
4111-184447-0072 DID ANY WOMAN EVER HAVE A MORE LOVELY LOVER THAN THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I SHOULD HAVE ROCKED HIM IN THE TWILIGHT IF DOCTOR JOHN'S VOICE HADN'T COME ACROSS THE HALL IN COMMAND
4111-184447-0073 PUT HIM DOWN NOW MISSUS MOLLY AND COME AND SAY OTHER HOW DO YOU DOES HE CALLED SOFTLY
4111-184447-0074 JUST WHERE DOES THAT CORSET PRESS YOU WORST HE ASKED IN THE TONE OF VOICE HE USES TO SAY PUT OUT YOUR TONGUE SO MUCH OF MY BAD TEMPER ROSE TO MY FACE THAT IT IS A WONDER IT DIDN'T MAKE A SCAR BUT I WAS COLD ENOUGH TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES
4111-184447-0075 I SAID LOOKING INTO HIS FACE AS THOUGH I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE I BEG YOUR PARDON MOLLY HE EXCLAIMED AND HIS FACE WAS REDDER THAN MINE AND THEN IT WENT WHITE WITH MORTIFICATION I COULDN'T STAND THAT
4111-184447-0076 AND HAD IT IN BOTH OF MINE I KNOW I LOOK AS IF I WAS SHRUNK OR LACED BUT I'M NOT I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT I'M REALLY INCHES BIGGER IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND JUST JUST CONTROLLED THE WOMAN CALLED IT IN THE WRONG PLACE
4111-184447-0077 THE BLOOD CAME BACK INTO HIS FACE AND HE LAUGHED AS HE GAVE ME A LITTLE SHAKE THAT PUSHED ME AWAY FROM HIM DON'T YOU EVER SCARE ME LIKE THAT AGAIN CHILD OR IT MIGHT BE SERIOUS HE SAID IN THE
4111-184447-0078 BILLY AND ME TONE OF VOICE THAT I LIKE A LITTLE ONLY I NEVER WILL I SAID IN A HURRY I WANT YOU TO ASK ME ANYTHING IN THE WORLD YOU WANT TO AND I'LL ALWAYS DO IT WELL LET ME TAKE YOU HOME THROUGH THE GARDEN THEN
4111-184447-0079 AND YES I BELIEVE I'LL STAY TO SUPPER WITH MISSUS HENDERSON DON'T YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT A LITTLE GIRL LIKE YOU DID IN A BIG CITY AND AND READ ME PART OF THAT PARIS LETTER I SAW THE POSTMAN GIVE JANE THIS AFTERNOON
