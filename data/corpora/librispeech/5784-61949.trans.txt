5784-61949-0000 SNEFFELS IS THE TERMINATION OF A LONG RANGE OF VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS OF A DIFFERENT CHARACTER TO THE SYSTEM OF THE ISLAND ITSELF ONE OF ITS PECULIARITIES IS ITS TWO HUGE POINTED SUMMITS
5784-61949-0001 THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE GREAT UNDERTAKING FILLED ME WITH AWE NOW THAT WE HAD ACTUALLY STARTED I BEGAN TO BELIEVE IN THE REALITY OF THE UNDERTAKING OUR PARTY FORMED QUITE A PROCESSION
5784-61949-0002 WE WALKED IN SINGLE FILE PRECEDED BY HANS THE IMPERTURBABLE EIDER DUCK HUNTER HE CALMLY LED US BY NARROW PATHS WHERE TWO PERSONS COULD BY NO POSSIBILITY WALK ABREAST
5784-61949-0003 WE FOUND OURSELVES MAKING OUR WAY THROUGH FIBROUS TURF OVER WHICH GREW A SCANTY VEGETATION OF GRASS THE RESIDUUM OF THE ANCIENT VEGETATION OF THE SWAMPY PENINSULA THE VAST MASS OF THIS COMBUSTIBLE
5784-61949-0004 THE FIELD OF WHICH AS YET IS UTTERLY UNEXPLORED WOULD SUFFICE TO WARM ICELAND FOR A WHOLE CENTURY THIS MIGHTY TURF PIT MEASURED FROM THE BOTTOM OF CERTAIN RAVINES IS OFTEN NOT LESS THAN SEVENTY FEET DEEP
5784-61949-0005 BURNED UP ROCKY DETRITUS SEPARATED BY THIN STREAKS OF POROUS SANDSTONE THE GRANDEUR OF THE SPECTACLE WAS UNDOUBTED AS WELL AS ITS ARID AND DESERTED AIR
5784-61949-0006 AS A TRUE NEPHEW OF THE GREAT PROFESSOR HARDWIGG AND DESPITE MY PREOCCUPATION AND DOLEFUL FEARS OF WHAT WAS TO COME
5784-61949-0007 LOOKING BACK TO MY RECENT STUDIES I WENT OVER IN THOUGHT THE WHOLE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF ICELAND
5784-61949-0008 THIS EXTRAORDINARY AND CURIOUS ISLAND MUST HAVE MADE ITS APPEARANCE FROM OUT OF THE GREAT WORLD OF WATERS AT A COMPARATIVELY RECENT DATE LIKE THE CORAL ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC IT MAY FOR AUGHT WE KNOW
5784-61949-0009 BE STILL RISING BY SLOW AND IMPERCEPTIBLE DEGREES IF THIS REALLY BE THE CASE ITS ORIGIN CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO ONLY ONE CAUSE THAT OF THE CONTINUED ACTION OF SUBTERRANEAN FIRES
5784-61949-0010 AWAY WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE PARCHMENT OF ARNE SAKNUSSEMM THE WONDERFUL PRETENSIONS TO DISCOVERY ON THE PART OF MY UNCLE AND TO OUR JOURNEY ALL MUST END IN SMOKE CHARMED WITH THE IDEA
5784-61949-0011 I BEGAN MORE CAREFULLY TO LOOK ABOUT ME A SERIOUS STUDY OF THE SOIL WAS NECESSARY TO NEGATIVE OR CONFIRM MY HYPOTHESIS I TOOK IN EVERY ITEM OF WHAT I SAW
5784-61949-0012 AND I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND THE SUCCESSION OF PHENOMENA WHICH HAD PRECEDED ITS FORMATION ICELAND BEING ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT SEDIMENTARY SOIL IS COMPOSED EXCLUSIVELY OF VOLCANIC TUFA THAT IS TO SAY
5784-61949-0013 OF AN AGGLOMERATION OF STONES AND OF ROCKS OF A POROUS TEXTURE LONG BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF VOLCANOES IT WAS COMPOSED OF A SOLID BODY OF MASSIVE TRAP ROCK LIFTED BODILY AND SLOWLY OUT OF THE SEA
5784-61949-0014 BY THE ACTION OF THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE AT WORK IN THE EARTH THE INTERNAL FIRES HOWEVER HAD NOT AS YET BURST THEIR BOUNDS AND FLOODED THE EXTERIOR CAKE OF MOTHER EARTH WITH HOT AND RAGING LAVA
5784-61949-0015 A HUGE AND MIGHTY FISSURE MUST REASONING BY ANALOGY HAVE BEEN DUG DIAGONALLY FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE ISLAND THROUGH WHICH BY DEGREES FLOWED THE VOLCANIC CRUST THE GREAT AND WONDROUS PHENOMENON
5784-61949-0016 THEN WENT ON WITHOUT VIOLENCE THE OUTPOURING WAS ENORMOUS AND THE SEETHING FUSED MATTER EJECTED FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH SPREAD SLOWLY AND PEACEFULLY IN THE FORM OF VAST LEVEL PLAINS OR WHAT ARE CALLED
5784-61949-0017 BUT AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS OVERFLOW THE DEPTH OF THE ISLAND INCREASED IT CAN READILY BE BELIEVED WHAT AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF ELASTIC FLUIDS WERE PILED UP WITHIN ITS CENTRE
5784-61949-0018 WHEN AT LAST IT AFFORDED NO OTHER OPENINGS AFTER THE PROCESS OF COOLING THE CRUST HAD TAKEN PLACE AT LENGTH A TIME CAME WHEN DESPITE THE ENORMOUS THICKNESS AND WEIGHT OF THE UPPER CRUST
5784-61949-0019 THE MECHANICAL FORCES OF THE COMBUSTIBLE GASES BELOW BECAME SO GREAT THAT THEY ACTUALLY UPHEAVED THE WEIGHTY BACK AND MADE FOR THEMSELVES HUGE AND GIGANTIC SHAFTS
5784-61949-0020 HENCE THE VOLCANOES WHICH SUDDENLY AROSE THROUGH THE UPPER CRUST AND NEXT THE CRATERS WHICH BURST FORTH AT THE SUMMIT OF THESE NEW CREATIONS
5784-61949-0021 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE FIRST PHENOMENA IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORMATION OF THE ISLAND WERE SIMPLY ERUPTIVE TO THESE HOWEVER SHORTLY SUCCEEDED THE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA
5784-61949-0022 THROUGH THE NEWLY FORMED OPENINGS ESCAPED THE MARVELOUS MASS OF BASALTIC STONES WITH WHICH THE PLAIN WE WERE NOW CROSSING WAS COVERED WE WERE TRAMPLING OUR WAY OVER HEAVY ROCKS OF DARK GREY COLOR
5784-61949-0023 WHICH WHILE COOLING HAD BEEN MOULDED INTO SIX SIDED PRISMS IN THE BACK DISTANCE WE COULD SEE A NUMBER OF FLATTENED CONES WHICH FORMERLY WERE SO MANY FIRE VOMITING MOUTHS
5784-61949-0024 AFTER THE BASALTIC ERUPTION WAS APPEASED AND SET AT REST THE VOLCANO THE FORCE OF WHICH INCREASED WITH THAT OF THE EXTINCT CRATERS GAVE FREE PASSAGE TO THE FIERY OVERFLOW OF LAVA
5784-61949-0025 STONE NOW SCATTERED OVER THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAIN LIKE DISHEVELED HAIR ON THE SHOULDERS OF A
5784-61949-0026 HERE IN A NUTSHELL I HAD THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE PHENOMENA FROM WHICH ICELAND AROSE ALL TAKE THEIR RISE IN THE FIERCE ACTION OF INTERIOR FIRES
5784-61949-0027 AND TO BELIEVE THAT THE CENTRAL MASS DID NOT REMAIN IN A STATE OF LIQUID FIRE WHITE HOT WAS SIMPLY AND PURELY MADNESS
5784-61949-0028 AND THEREFORE WENT LIKE A BRAVE SOLDIER MOUNTING A BRISTLING BATTERY TO THE ASSAULT OF OLD SNEFFELS AS WE ADVANCED THE ROAD BECAME EVERY MOMENT MORE DIFFICULT THE SOIL WAS BROKEN AND DANGEROUS
5784-61949-0029 THE ROCKS BROKE AND GAVE WAY UNDER OUR FEET AND WE HAD TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CAREFUL IN ORDER TO AVOID DANGEROUS AND CONSTANT FALLS HANS ADVANCED AS CALMLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING OVER SALISBURY PLAIN
5784-61949-0030 SOMETIMES HE WOULD DISAPPEAR BEHIND HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE AND WE MOMENTARILY LOST SIGHT OF HIM THERE WAS A LITTLE PERIOD OF ANXIETY AND THEN THERE WAS A SHRILL WHISTLE
5784-61949-0031 AND SILENTLY PILE THEM UP INTO SMALL HEAPS IN ORDER THAT WE MIGHT NOT LOSE OUR WAY ON OUR RETURN HE HAD NO IDEA OF THE JOURNEY WE WERE ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE AT ALL EVENTS THE PRECAUTION WAS A GOOD ONE
5784-61949-0032 THOUGH HOW UTTERLY USELESS AND UNNECESSARY BUT I MUST NOT ANTICIPATE THREE HOURS OF TERRIBLE FATIGUE WALKING INCESSANTLY HAD ONLY BROUGHT US TO THE FOOT OF THE GREAT MOUNTAIN
5784-61949-0033 THIS WILL GIVE SOME NOTION OF WHAT WE HAD STILL TO UNDERGO SUDDENLY HOWEVER HANS CRIED A HALT THAT IS HE MADE SIGNS TO THAT EFFECT AND A SUMMARY KIND OF BREAKFAST WAS LAID OUT ON THE LAVA BEFORE US
5784-61949-0034 MY UNCLE WHO NOW WAS SIMPLY PROFESSOR HARDWIGG WAS SO EAGER TO ADVANCE THAT HE BOLTED HIS FOOD LIKE A GREEDY CLOWN THIS HALT FOR REFRESHMENT WAS ALSO A HALT FOR REPOSE
5784-61949-0035 THE PROFESSOR WAS THEREFORE COMPELLED TO WAIT THE GOOD PLEASURE OF HIS IMPERTURBABLE GUIDE WHO DID NOT GIVE THE SIGNAL FOR DEPARTURE FOR A GOOD HOUR THE THREE ICELANDERS
5784-61949-0036 WHO WERE AS TACITURN AS THEIR COMRADE DID NOT SAY A WORD BUT WENT ON EATING AND DRINKING VERY QUIETLY AND SOBERLY FROM THIS OUR FIRST REAL STAGE WE BEGAN TO ASCEND THE SLOPES OF THE SNEFFELS VOLCANO
5784-61949-0037 ITS MAGNIFICENT SNOWY NIGHTCAP AS WE BEGAN TO CALL IT BY AN OPTICAL DELUSION VERY COMMON IN MOUNTAINS APPEARED TO ME TO BE CLOSE AT HAND
5784-61949-0038 WHAT UNHEARD OF FATIGUE MUST WE ENDURE THE STONES ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE HELD TOGETHER BY NO CEMENT OF SOIL BOUND TOGETHER BY NO ROOTS OR CREEPING HERBS GAVE WAY CONTINUALLY UNDER OUR FEET
5784-61949-0039 AND WENT RUSHING BELOW INTO THE PLAINS LIKE A SERIES OF SMALL AVALANCHES IN CERTAIN PLACES THE SIDES OF THIS STUPENDOUS MOUNTAIN WERE AT AN ANGLE SO STEEP THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CLIMB UPWARDS
5784-61949-0040 AND WE WERE COMPELLED TO GET ROUND THESE OBSTACLES AS BEST WE MIGHT THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND ALPINE CLIMBING WILL COMPREHEND OUR DIFFICULTIES OFTEN WE WERE OBLIGED TO HELP EACH OTHER ALONG BY MEANS OF OUR CLIMBING POLES
5784-61949-0041 I MUST SAY THIS FOR MY UNCLE THAT HE STUCK AS CLOSE TO ME AS POSSIBLE HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF ME AND ON MANY OCCASIONS HIS ARM SUPPLIED ME WITH FIRM AND SOLID SUPPORT HE WAS STRONG
5784-61949-0042 THE ICELANDERS THOUGH HEAVILY LOADED CLIMBED WITH THE AGILITY OF MOUNTAINEERS LOOKING UP EVERY NOW AND THEN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE GREAT VOLCANO OF SNEFFELS IT APPEARED TO ME WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH TO THE SUMMIT ON THAT SIDE
5784-61949-0043 AT ALL EVENTS IF THE ANGLE OF INCLINATION DID NOT SPEEDILY CHANGE FORTUNATELY AFTER AN HOUR OF UNHEARD OF FATIGUES AND OF GYMNASTIC EXERCISES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TRYING TO AN ACROBAT
5784-61949-0044 AND THEIR ROADS TABLE BAY HERE TO OUR MUTUAL SURPRISE WE FOUND AN ACTUAL FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS WHICH WONDERFULLY ASSISTED OUR ASCENT THIS SINGULAR FLIGHT OF STAIRS WAS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE VOLCANIC
5784-61949-0045 THE ICELANDIC NAME IS STINA IF THIS SINGULAR TORRENT HAD NOT BEEN CHECKED IN ITS DESCENT BY THE PECULIAR SHAPE OF THE FLANKS OF THE MOUNTAIN IT WOULD HAVE SWEPT INTO THE SEA AND WOULD HAVE FORMED NEW ISLANDS
5784-61949-0046 SUCH AS IT WAS IT SERVED US ADMIRABLY THE ABRUPT CHARACTER OF THE SLOPES MOMENTARILY INCREASED BUT THESE REMARKABLE STONE STEPS A LITTLE LESS DIFFICULT THAN THOSE OF THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS
5784-61949-0047 AFTER HAVING CLAMBERED UP TWO THOUSAND OF THESE ROUGH STEPS WE FOUND OURSELVES OVERLOOKING A KIND OF SPUR OR PROJECTION OF THE MOUNTAIN A SORT OF BUTTRESS UPON WHICH THE CONELIKE CRATER PROPERLY SO CALLED
5784-61949-0048 LEANED FOR SUPPORT THE OCEAN LAY BENEATH US AT A DEPTH OF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FEET A GRAND AND MIGHTY SPECTACLE WE HAD REACHED THE REGION OF ETERNAL SNOWS THE COLD WAS KEEN
5784-61949-0049 SEARCHING AND INTENSE THE WIND BLEW WITH EXTRAORDINARY VIOLENCE I WAS UTTERLY EXHAUSTED MY WORTHY UNCLE THE PROFESSOR SAW CLEARLY THAT MY LEGS REFUSED FURTHER SERVICE AND THAT IN FACT
5784-61949-0050 I WAS UTTERLY EXHAUSTED DESPITE HIS HOT AND FEVERISH IMPATIENCE HE DECIDED WITH A SIGH UPON A HALT HE CALLED THE EIDER DUCK HUNTER TO HIS SIDE THAT WORTHY HOWEVER SHOOK HIS HEAD
5784-61949-0051 WAS HIS SOLE SPOKEN REPLY IT APPEARS SAYS MY UNCLE WITH A WOEBEGONE LOOK THAT WE MUST GO HIGHER
5784-61949-0052 DECISIVE RESPONSE MISTOUR REPLIED THE GUIDE JA MISTOUR YES THE MISTOUR CRIED ONE OF THE ICELANDIC GUIDES IN A TERRIFIED TONE
5784-61949-0053 OF SAND OF DUST RISING TO THE HEAVENS IN THE FORM OF A MIGHTY WATERSPOUT IT RESEMBLED THE FEARFUL PHENOMENON OF A SIMILAR CHARACTER KNOWN TO THE TRAVELERS IN THE DESERT OF THE GREAT SAHARA
5784-61949-0054 ON WHICH WE WERE PERCHED THIS OPAQUE VEIL STANDING UP BETWEEN US AND THE SUN PROJECTED A DEEP SHADOW ON THE FLANKS OF THE MOUNTAIN IF THIS SAND SPOUT BROKE OVER US WE MUST ALL BE INFALLIBLY DESTROYED
5784-61949-0055 CRUSHED IN ITS FEARFUL EMBRACES THIS EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON VERY COMMON WHEN THE WIND SHAKES THE GLACIERS AND SWEEPS OVER THE ARID PLAINS IS IN THE ICELANDIC TONGUE CALLED MISTOUR
5784-61949-0056 HASTIGT HASTIGT CRIED OUR GUIDE NOW I CERTAINLY KNEW NOTHING OF DANISH BUT I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS GESTURES WERE MEANT TO QUICKEN US
5784-61949-0057 THE GUIDE TURNED RAPIDLY IN A DIRECTION WHICH WOULD TAKE US TO THE BACK OF THE CRATER ALL THE WHILE ASCENDING SLIGHTLY WE FOLLOWED RAPIDLY DESPITE OUR EXCESSIVE FATIGUE
5784-61949-0058 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER HANS PAUSED TO ENABLE US TO LOOK BACK THE MIGHTY WHIRLWIND OF SAND WAS SPREADING UP THE SLOPE OF THE MOUNTAIN TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE WE HAD PROPOSED TO HALT HUGE STONES WERE CAUGHT UP
5784-61949-0059 CAST INTO THE AIR AND THROWN ABOUT AS DURING AN ERUPTION WE WERE HAPPILY A LITTLE OUT OF THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND
5784-61949-0060 BUT FOR THE PRECAUTION AND KNOWLEDGE OF OUR GUIDE OUR DISLOCATED BODIES OUR CRUSHED AND BROKEN LIMBS WOULD HAVE BEEN CAST TO THE WIND LIKE DUST FROM SOME UNKNOWN METEOR
5784-61949-0061 HANS HOWEVER DID NOT THINK IT PRUDENT TO PASS THE NIGHT ON THE BARE SIDE OF THE CONE WE THEREFORE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY IN A ZIGZAG DIRECTION THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET WHICH REMAINED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED TOOK US AT
5784-61949-0062 LEAST FIVE HOURS THE TURNINGS AND WINDINGS THE NO THOROUGHFARES THE MARCHES AND MARCHES TURNED THAT INSIGNIFICANT DISTANCE INTO AT LEAST THREE LEAGUES I NEVER FELT SUCH MISERY
5784-61949-0063 WHEN I THOUGHT MYSELF AT MY LAST GASP ABOUT ELEVEN AT NIGHT IT BEING IN THAT REGION QUITE DARK WE REACHED THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT SNEFFELS
