1154-129975-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN MARIANNE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HERSELF VERY INEXCUSABLE HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER PARTING FROM WILLOUGHBY SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO LOOK HER FAMILY IN THE FACE THE NEXT MORNING HAD SHE NOT RISEN FROM HER BED
1154-129975-0001 BUT THE FEELINGS WHICH MADE SUCH COMPOSURE A DISGRACE LEFT HER IN NO DANGER OF INCURRING IT SHE WAS AWAKE THE WHOLE NIGHT AND SHE WEPT THE GREATEST PART OF IT SHE GOT UP WITH A HEADACHE WAS UNABLE TO TALK AND UNWILLING TO TAKE ANY NOURISHMENT
1154-129975-0002 GIVING PAIN EVERY MOMENT TO HER MOTHER AND SISTERS AND FORBIDDING ALL ATTEMPT AT CONSOLATION FROM EITHER HER SENSIBILITY WAS POTENT ENOUGH WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER SHE WALKED OUT BY HERSELF AND WANDERED ABOUT THE VILLAGE OF ALLENHAM INDULGING
1154-129975-0003 AND CRYING OVER THE PRESENT REVERSE FOR THE CHIEF OF THE MORNING
1154-129975-0004 SHE PLAYED OVER EVERY FAVOURITE SONG THAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO PLAY TO WILLOUGHBY EVERY AIR IN WHICH THEIR VOICES HAD BEEN OFTENEST JOINED AND SAT AT THE INSTRUMENT GAZING ON EVERY LINE OF MUSIC THAT HE HAD WRITTEN OUT FOR HER
1154-129975-0005 TILL HER HEART WAS SO HEAVY THAT NO FARTHER SADNESS COULD BE GAINED AND THIS NOURISHMENT OF GRIEF WAS EVERY DAY APPLIED SHE SPENT WHOLE HOURS AT THE PIANOFORTE ALTERNATELY SINGING AND CRYING HER VOICE OFTEN TOTALLY SUSPENDED BY HER TEARS
1154-129975-0006 IN BOOKS TOO AS WELL AS IN MUSIC SHE COURTED THE MISERY WHICH A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE PAST AND PRESENT WAS CERTAIN OF GIVING SHE READ NOTHING BUT WHAT THEY HAD BEEN USED TO READ TOGETHER
1154-129975-0007 SUCH VIOLENCE OF AFFLICTION INDEED COULD NOT BE SUPPORTED FOR EVER IT SUNK WITHIN A FEW DAYS INTO A CALMER MELANCHOLY BUT THESE EMPLOYMENTS TO WHICH SHE DAILY RECURRED HER SOLITARY WALKS AND SILENT MEDITATIONS
1154-129975-0008 STILL PRODUCED OCCASIONAL EFFUSIONS OF SORROW AS LIVELY AS EVER NO LETTER FROM WILLOUGHBY CAME AND NONE SEEMED EXPECTED BY MARIANNE
1154-129975-0009 BUT MISSUS DASHWOOD COULD FIND EXPLANATIONS WHENEVER SHE WANTED THEM WHICH AT LEAST SATISFIED HERSELF
1154-129975-0010 HOW VERY OFTEN SIR JOHN FETCHES OUR LETTERS HIMSELF FROM THE POST AND CARRIES THEM TO IT WE HAVE ALREADY AGREED THAT SECRECY MAY BE NECESSARY
1154-129975-0011 ELINOR COULD NOT DENY THE TRUTH OF THIS
1154-129975-0012 BUT THERE WAS ONE METHOD SO DIRECT SO SIMPLE AND IN HER OPINION SO ELIGIBLE OF KNOWING THE REAL STATE OF THE AFFAIR AND OF INSTANTLY REMOVING ALL MYSTERY
1154-129975-0013 WHY DO YOU NOT ASK MARIANNE AT ONCE SAID SHE
1154-129975-0014 FROM YOU HER MOTHER AND SO KIND SO INDULGENT A MOTHER THE QUESTION COULD NOT GIVE OFFENCE IT WOULD BE THE NATURAL RESULT OF YOUR AFFECTION FOR HER
1154-129975-0015 I WOULD NOT ASK SUCH A QUESTION FOR THE WORLD SUPPOSING IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE NOT ENGAGED WHAT DISTRESS WOULD NOT SUCH AN ENQUIRY INFLICT AT ANY RATE IT WOULD BE MOST UNGENEROUS I SHOULD NEVER DESERVE HER CONFIDENCE AGAIN AFTER FORCING FROM HER A CONFESSION
1154-129975-0016 OF WHAT IS MEANT AT PRESENT TO BE UNACKNOWLEDGED TO ANY ONE I KNOW MARIANNE'S HEART
1154-129975-0017 CONSIDERING HER SISTER'S YOUTH AND URGED THE MATTER FARTHER BUT IN VAIN COMMON SENSE COMMON CARE COMMON PRUDENCE WERE ALL SUNK IN MISSUS DASHWOOD'S ROMANTIC DELICACY
1154-129975-0018 IT WAS SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE WILLOUGHBY'S NAME WAS MENTIONED BEFORE MARIANNE BY ANY OF HER FAMILY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS INDEED WERE NOT SO NICE
1154-129975-0019 BUT ONE EVENING MISSUS DASHWOOD ACCIDENTALLY TAKING UP A VOLUME OF SHAKESPEARE EXCLAIMED WE HAVE NEVER FINISHED HAMLET MARIANNE OUR DEAR WILLOUGHBY WENT AWAY BEFORE WE COULD GET THROUGH IT
1154-129975-0020 MONTHS CRIED MARIANNE WITH STRONG SURPRISE NO NOR MANY WEEKS MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS SORRY FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
1154-129975-0021 AND KNOWLEDGE OF HIS INTENTIONS ONE MORNING ABOUT A WEEK AFTER HIS LEAVING THE COUNTRY MARIANNE WAS PREVAILED ON TO JOIN HER SISTERS IN THEIR USUAL WALK INSTEAD OF WANDERING AWAY BY HERSELF
1154-129975-0022 HITHERTO SHE HAD CAREFULLY AVOIDED EVERY COMPANION IN HER RAMBLES IF HER SISTERS INTENDED TO WALK ON THE DOWNS SHE DIRECTLY STOLE AWAY TOWARDS THE LANES
1154-129975-0023 AND COULD NEVER BE FOUND WHEN THE OTHERS SET OFF
1154-129975-0024 WHO GREATLY DISAPPROVED SUCH CONTINUAL SECLUSION THEY WALKED ALONG THE ROAD THROUGH THE VALLEY AND CHIEFLY IN SILENCE FOR MARIANNE'S MIND COULD NOT BE CONTROLLED
1154-129975-0025 BEYOND THE ENTRANCE OF THE VALLEY WHERE THE COUNTRY THOUGH STILL RICH WAS LESS WILD AND MORE OPEN A LONG STRETCH OF THE ROAD WHICH THEY HAD TRAVELLED ON FIRST COMING TO BARTON LAY BEFORE THEM
1154-129975-0026 AND ON REACHING THAT POINT THEY STOPPED TO LOOK AROUND THEM AND EXAMINE A PROSPECT WHICH FORMED THE DISTANCE OF THEIR VIEW FROM THE COTTAGE FROM A SPOT WHICH THEY HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO REACH IN ANY OF THEIR WALKS BEFORE
1154-129975-0027 AMONGST THE OBJECTS IN THE SCENE THEY SOON DISCOVERED AN ANIMATED ONE IT WAS A MAN ON HORSEBACK RIDING TOWARDS THEM IN A FEW MINUTES THEY COULD DISTINGUISH HIM TO BE A GENTLEMAN
1154-129975-0028 A THIRD ALMOST AS WELL KNOWN AS WILLOUGHBY'S JOINED THEM IN BEGGING HER TO STOP AND SHE TURNED ROUND WITH SURPRISE TO SEE AND WELCOME EDWARD FERRARS HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO COULD AT THAT MOMENT BE FORGIVEN FOR NOT BEING WILLOUGHBY
1154-129975-0029 THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD HAVE GAINED A SMILE FROM HER BUT SHE DISPERSED HER TEARS TO SMILE ON HIM
1154-129975-0030 WHITHER HE WAS PURPOSELY COMING TO VISIT THEM HE WAS WELCOMED BY THEM ALL WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
1154-129975-0031 TO MARIANNE INDEED THE MEETING BETWEEN EDWARD AND HER SISTER WAS BUT A CONTINUATION OF THAT UNACCOUNTABLE COLDNESS WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN OBSERVED AT NORLAND IN THEIR MUTUAL BEHAVIOUR
1154-129975-0032 ON EDWARD'S SIDE MORE PARTICULARLY THERE WAS A DEFICIENCY OF ALL THAT A LOVER OUGHT TO LOOK AND SAY ON SUCH AN OCCASION HE WAS CONFUSED SEEMED SCARCELY SENSIBLE OF PLEASURE IN SEEING THEM LOOKED NEITHER RAPTUROUS NOR GAY SAID LITTLE BUT WHAT WAS FORCED FROM HIM BY QUESTIONS
1154-129975-0033 MARIANNE SAW AND LISTENED WITH INCREASING SURPRISE SHE BEGAN ALMOST TO FEEL A DISLIKE OF EDWARD AND IT ENDED AS EVERY FEELING MUST END WITH HER BY CARRYING BACK HER THOUGHTS TO WILLOUGHBY
1154-129975-0034 WHOSE MANNERS FORMED A CONTRAST SUFFICIENTLY STRIKING TO THOSE OF HIS BROTHER ELECT
1154-129975-0035 MARIANNE ASKED EDWARD IF HE CAME DIRECTLY FROM LONDON NO HE HAD BEEN IN DEVONSHIRE A FORTNIGHT A FORTNIGHT SHE REPEATED SURPRISED AT HIS BEING SO LONG IN THE SAME COUNTY WITH ELINOR WITHOUT SEEING HER BEFORE
1154-129975-0036 HAVE YOU BEEN LATELY IN SUSSEX SAID ELINOR I WAS AT NORLAND ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND HOW DOES DEAR DEAR NORLAND LOOK CRIED MARIANNE
1154-129975-0037 THE WOODS AND WALKS THICKLY COVERED WITH DEAD LEAVES
1154-129975-0038 WITH WHAT TRANSPORTING SENSATION HAVE I FORMERLY SEEN THEM FALL
1154-129975-0039 WHAT FEELINGS HAVE THEY THE SEASON THE AIR ALTOGETHER INSPIRED
1154-129975-0040 BUT ROUSING HERSELF AGAIN NOW EDWARD SAID SHE CALLING HIS ATTENTION TO THE PROSPECT HERE IS BARTON VALLEY LOOK UP TO IT AND BE TRANQUIL IF YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE HILLS DID YOU EVER SEE THEIR EQUALS TO THE LEFT IS BARTON PARK
1154-129975-0041 AMONGST THOSE WOODS AND PLANTATIONS YOU MAY SEE THE END OF THE HOUSE AND THERE BENEATH THAT FARTHEST HILL WHICH RISES WITH SUCH GRANDEUR IS OUR COTTAGE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY HE REPLIED BUT THESE BOTTOMS MUST BE DIRTY IN WINTER
1154-129975-0042 HOW CAN YOU THINK OF DIRT WITH SUCH OBJECTS BEFORE YOU BECAUSE REPLIED HE SMILING
1154-129975-0043 HOW STRANGE SAID MARIANNE TO HERSELF AS SHE WALKED ON
1154-129975-0044 NO NOT ALL ANSWERED MARIANNE WE COULD NOT BE MORE UNFORTUNATELY SITUATED MARIANNE CRIED HER SISTER HOW CAN YOU SAY SO HOW CAN YOU BE SO UNJUST
1154-129975-0045 THEY ARE A VERY RESPECTABLE FAMILY MISTER FERRARS AND TOWARDS US HAVE BEHAVED IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER HAVE YOU FORGOT MARIANNE HOW MANY PLEASANT DAYS WE HAVE OWED TO THEM NO SAID MARIANNE IN A LOW VOICE NOR HOW MANY PAINFUL MOMENTS
1154-129975-0046 ENDEAVOURED TO SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE DISCOURSE WITH HIM BY TALKING OF THEIR PRESENT RESIDENCE
