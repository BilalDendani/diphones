2988-7587-0000 THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M VALDEMAR
2988-7587-0001 OF COURSE I SHALL NOT PRETEND TO CONSIDER IT ANY MATTER FOR WONDER THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF M VALDEMAR HAS EXCITED DISCUSSION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MIRACLE HAD IT NOT ESPECIALLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
2988-7587-0002 THROUGH THE DESIRE OF ALL PARTIES CONCERNED TO KEEP THE AFFAIR FROM THE PUBLIC AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT OR UNTIL WE HAD FARTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTIGATION THROUGH OUR ENDEAVORS TO EFFECT THIS A GARBLED OR EXAGGERATED ACCOUNT
2988-7587-0003 MADE ITS WAY INTO SOCIETY AND BECAME THE SOURCE OF MANY UNPLEASANT MISREPRESENTATIONS AND VERY NATURALLY OF A GREAT DEAL OF DISBELIEF IT IS NOW RENDERED NECESSARY THAT I GIVE THE FACTS
2988-7587-0004 THEY ARE SUCCINCTLY THESE MY ATTENTION FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY DRAWN TO THE SUBJECT OF MESMERISM AND ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO IT OCCURRED TO ME QUITE SUDDENLY THAT IN THE SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS MADE HITHERTO
2988-7587-0005 THERE HAD BEEN A VERY REMARKABLE AND MOST UNACCOUNTABLE OMISSION NO PERSON HAD AS YET BEEN MESMERIZED IN ARTICULO MORTIS IT REMAINED TO BE SEEN FIRST WHETHER
2988-7587-0006 IN SUCH CONDITION THERE EXISTED IN THE PATIENT ANY SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE MAGNETIC INFLUENCE SECONDLY WHETHER IF ANY EXISTED IT WAS IMPAIRED OR INCREASED BY THE CONDITION THIRDLY TO WHAT EXTENT OR FOR HOW LONG A PERIOD
2988-7587-0007 THE ENCROACHMENTS OF DEATH MIGHT BE ARRESTED BY THE PROCESS THERE WERE OTHER POINTS TO BE ASCERTAINED BUT THESE MOST EXCITED MY CURIOSITY THE LAST IN ESPECIAL FROM THE IMMENSELY IMPORTANT CHARACTER OF ITS CONSEQUENCES
2988-7587-0008 IN LOOKING AROUND ME FOR SOME SUBJECT BY WHOSE MEANS I MIGHT TEST THESE PARTICULARS I WAS BROUGHT TO THINK OF MY FRIEND M ERNEST VALDEMAR THE WELL KNOWN COMPILER OF THE BIBLIOTHECA FORENSICA AND AUTHOR
2988-7587-0009 OF THE POLISH VERSIONS OF WALLENSTEIN AND GARGANTUA M VALDEMAR WHO HAS RESIDED PRINCIPALLY AT HARLAEM
2988-7587-0010 IS OR WAS PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE FOR THE EXTREME SPARENESS OF HIS PERSON HIS LOWER LIMBS MUCH RESEMBLING THOSE OF JOHN RANDOLPH AND ALSO FOR THE WHITENESS OF HIS WHISKERS IN VIOLENT CONTRAST TO THE BLACKNESS OF HIS HAIR
2988-7587-0011 THE LATTER IN CONSEQUENCE BEING VERY GENERALLY MISTAKEN FOR A WIG HIS TEMPERAMENT WAS MARKEDLY NERVOUS AND RENDERED HIM A GOOD SUBJECT FOR MESMERIC EXPERIMENT ON TWO OR THREE OCCASIONS
2988-7587-0012 I HAD PUT HIM TO SLEEP WITH LITTLE DIFFICULTY BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED IN OTHER RESULTS WHICH HIS PECULIAR CONSTITUTION HAD NATURALLY LED ME TO ANTICIPATE HIS WILL WAS AT NO PERIOD POSITIVELY OR THOROUGHLY UNDER MY CONTROL AND IN REGARD TO CLAIRVOYANCE
2988-7587-0013 I COULD ACCOMPLISH WITH HIM NOTHING TO BE RELIED UPON I ALWAYS ATTRIBUTED MY FAILURE AT THESE POINTS
2988-7587-0014 FOR SOME MONTHS PREVIOUS TO MY BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH HIM HIS PHYSICIANS HAD DECLARED HIM
2988-7587-0015 IT WAS HIS CUSTOM INDEED TO SPEAK CALMLY OF HIS APPROACHING DISSOLUTION AS OF A MATTER NEITHER TO BE AVOIDED NOR REGRETTED WHEN THE IDEAS TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED FIRST OCCURRED TO ME IT WAS OF COURSE VERY NATURAL THAT I SHOULD THINK OF M VALDEMAR
2988-7587-0016 I KNEW THE STEADY PHILOSOPHY OF THE MAN TOO WELL TO APPREHEND ANY SCRUPLES FROM HIM AND HE HAD NO RELATIVES IN AMERICA WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO INTERFERE I SPOKE TO HIM FRANKLY UPON THE SUBJECT AND TO MY SURPRISE
2988-7587-0017 HIS INTEREST SEEMED VIVIDLY EXCITED I SAY TO MY SURPRISE FOR ALTHOUGH HE HAD ALWAYS YIELDED HIS PERSON FREELY TO MY EXPERIMENTS HE HAD NEVER BEFORE GIVEN ME ANY TOKENS OF SYMPATHY WITH WHAT I DID
2988-7587-0018 HIS DISEASE WAS OF THAT CHARACTER WHICH WOULD ADMIT OF EXACT CALCULATION IN RESPECT TO THE EPOCH OF ITS TERMINATION IN DEATH AND IT WAS FINALLY ARRANGED BETWEEN US THAT HE WOULD SEND FOR ME ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE PERIOD ANNOUNCED BY HIS PHYSICIANS AS THAT OF HIS DECEASE
2988-7587-0019 IT IS NOW RATHER MORE THAN SEVEN MONTHS SINCE I RECEIVED FROM M VALDEMAR HIMSELF THE SUBJOINED NOTE MY DEAR P YOU MAY AS WELL COME NOW D AND F ARE AGREED THAT I CANNOT HOLD OUT BEYOND TO MORROW MIDNIGHT
2988-7587-0020 AND I THINK THEY HAVE HIT THE TIME VERY NEARLY VALDEMAR I RECEIVED THIS NOTE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR AFTER IT WAS WRITTEN AND IN FIFTEEN MINUTES MORE I WAS IN THE DYING MAN'S CHAMBER I HAD NOT SEEN HIM FOR TEN DAYS
2988-7587-0021 WAS SO EXTREME THAT THE SKIN HAD BEEN BROKEN THROUGH BY THE CHEEK BONES HIS EXPECTORATION WAS EXCESSIVE THE PULSE WAS BARELY PERCEPTIBLE HE RETAINED NEVERTHELESS IN A VERY REMARKABLE MANNER
2988-7587-0022 BOTH HIS MENTAL POWER AND A CERTAIN DEGREE OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH HE SPOKE WITH DISTINCTNESS TOOK SOME PALLIATIVE MEDICINES WITHOUT AID AND WHEN I ENTERED THE ROOM WAS OCCUPIED IN PENCILING MEMORANDA IN A POCKET BOOK
2988-7587-0023 DOCTORS D AND F WERE IN ATTENDANCE AFTER PRESSING VALDEMAR'S HAND I TOOK THESE GENTLEMEN ASIDE AND OBTAINED FROM THEM A MINUTE ACCOUNT OF THE PATIENT'S CONDITION THE LEFT LUNG HAD BEEN FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS
2988-7587-0024 IN A SEMI OSSEOUS OR CARTILAGINOUS STATE
2988-7587-0025 THE RIGHT IN ITS UPPER PORTION WAS ALSO PARTIALLY IF NOT THOROUGHLY OSSIFIED WHILE THE LOWER REGION WAS MERELY A MASS
2988-7587-0026 RUNNING ONE INTO ANOTHER SEVERAL EXTENSIVE PERFORATIONS EXISTED AND AT ONE POINT PERMANENT ADHESION TO THE RIBS HAD TAKEN PLACE THESE APPEARANCES IN THE RIGHT LOBE
2988-7587-0027 WERE OF COMPARATIVELY RECENT DATE THE OSSIFICATION HAD PROCEEDED WITH VERY UNUSUAL RAPIDITY NO SIGN OF IT HAD BEEN DISCOVERED A MONTH BEFORE AND THE ADHESION HAD ONLY BEEN OBSERVED DURING THE THREE PREVIOUS DAYS
2988-7587-0028 THE PATIENT WAS SUSPECTED OF ANEURISM OF THE AORTA BUT ON THIS POINT THE OSSEOUS SYMPTOMS RENDERED AN EXACT DIAGNOSIS IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS THE OPINION OF BOTH PHYSICIANS
2988-7587-0029 SUNDAY IT WAS THEN SEVEN O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY EVENING ON QUITTING THE INVALID'S BED SIDE TO HOLD CONVERSATION WITH MYSELF DOCTORS D AND F HAD BIDDEN HIM A FINAL FAREWELL IT HAD NOT BEEN THEIR INTENTION TO RETURN
2988-7587-0030 BUT AT MY REQUEST THEY AGREED TO LOOK IN UPON THE PATIENT ABOUT TEN THE NEXT NIGHT
2988-7587-0031 AS WELL AS MORE PARTICULARLY OF THE EXPERIMENT PROPOSED HE STILL PROFESSED HIMSELF QUITE WILLING AND EVEN ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT MADE AND URGED ME TO COMMENCE IT AT ONCE
2988-7587-0032 BUT I DID NOT FEEL MYSELF ALTOGETHER AT LIBERTY TO ENGAGE IN A TASK OF THIS CHARACTER WITH NO MORE RELIABLE WITNESSES THAN THESE PEOPLE IN CASE OF SUDDEN ACCIDENT MIGHT PROVE I THEREFORE POSTPONED OPERATIONS UNTIL ABOUT EIGHT THE NEXT NIGHT
2988-7587-0033 WHEN THE ARRIVAL OF A MEDICAL STUDENT WITH WHOM I HAD SOME ACQUAINTANCE
2988-7587-0034 RELIEVED ME FROM FARTHER EMBARRASSMENT IT HAD BEEN MY DESIGN ORIGINALLY TO WAIT FOR THE PHYSICIANS BUT I WAS INDUCED TO PROCEED FIRST BY THE URGENT ENTREATIES OF M VALDEMAR AND SECONDLY BY MY CONVICTION THAT I HAD NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE
2988-7587-0035 AS HE WAS EVIDENTLY SINKING FAST
2988-7587-0036 THAT HE WOULD TAKE NOTES OF ALL THAT OCCURRED AND IT IS FROM HIS MEMORANDA
2988-7587-0037 EITHER CONDENSED OR COPIED VERBATIM IT WANTED ABOUT FIVE MINUTES OF EIGHT WHEN TAKING THE PATIENT'S HAND
2988-7587-0038 WAS ENTIRELY WILLING THAT I SHOULD MAKE THE EXPERIMENT OF MESMERIZING HIM IN HIS THEN CONDITION HE REPLIED FEEBLY
2988-7587-0039 ADDING IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
2988-7587-0040 WHICH I HAD ALREADY FOUND MOST EFFECTUAL IN SUBDUING HIM HE WAS EVIDENTLY INFLUENCED WITH THE FIRST LATERAL STROKE OF MY HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD BUT ALTHOUGH I EXERTED ALL MY POWERS NO FURTHER PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT WAS INDUCED UNTIL SOME MINUTES AFTER TEN O'CLOCK
2988-7587-0041 WHEN DOCTORS D AND F CALLED ACCORDING TO APPOINTMENT I EXPLAINED TO THEM IN A FEW WORDS WHAT I DESIGNED AND AS THEY OPPOSED NO OBJECTION SAYING THAT THE PATIENT WAS ALREADY IN THE DEATH AGONY I PROCEEDED WITHOUT HESITATION
2988-7587-0042 EXCHANGING HOWEVER THE LATERAL PASSES FOR DOWNWARD ONES AND DIRECTING MY GAZE ENTIRELY INTO THE RIGHT EYE OF THE SUFFERER BY THIS TIME HIS PULSE WAS IMPERCEPTIBLE AND HIS BREATHING WAS STERTOROUS AND AT INTERVALS OF HALF A MINUTE
2988-7587-0043 THIS CONDITION WAS NEARLY UNALTERED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT THE EXPIRATION OF THIS PERIOD HOWEVER A NATURAL ALTHOUGH A VERY DEEP SIGH ESCAPED THE BOSOM OF THE DYING MAN
2988-7587-0044 AND THE STERTOROUS BREATHING CEASED THAT IS TO SAY ITS STERTOROUSNESS WAS NO LONGER APPARENT THE INTERVALS WERE UNDIMINISHED THE PATIENT'S EXTREMITIES WERE OF AN ICY COLDNESS
2988-7587-0045 AT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE ELEVEN I PERCEIVED UNEQUIVOCAL SIGNS OF THE MESMERIC INFLUENCE THE GLASSY ROLL OF THE EYE WAS CHANGED FOR THAT EXPRESSION OF UNEASY INWARD EXAMINATION
2988-7587-0046 WITH A FEW RAPID LATERAL PASSES I MADE THE LIDS QUIVER AS IN INCIPIENT SLEEP AND WITH A FEW MORE I CLOSED THEM ALTOGETHER I WAS NOT SATISFIED HOWEVER WITH THIS
2988-7587-0047 AND REPOSED ON THE BED AT A MODERATE DISTANCE FROM THE LOIN THE HEAD WAS VERY SLIGHTLY ELEVATED WHEN I HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS IT WAS FULLY MIDNIGHT AND I REQUESTED THE GENTLEMEN PRESENT TO EXAMINE M VALDEMAR'S CONDITION
2988-7587-0048 AFTER A FEW EXPERIMENTS THEY ADMITTED HIM TO BE AN UNUSUALLY PERFECT STATE OF MESMERIC TRANCE THE CURIOSITY OF BOTH THE PHYSICIANS WAS GREATLY EXCITED DOCTOR D RESOLVED AT ONCE TO REMAIN WITH THE PATIENT ALL NIGHT
2988-7587-0049 WHILE DOCTOR F TOOK LEAVE WITH A PROMISE TO RETURN AT DAYBREAK
2988-7587-0050 THE PULSE WAS IMPERCEPTIBLE THE BREATHING WAS GENTLE SCARCELY NOTICEABLE UNLESS THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF A MIRROR TO THE LIPS THE EYES WERE CLOSED NATURALLY
2988-7587-0051 STILL THE GENERAL APPEARANCE WAS CERTAINLY NOT THAT OF DEATH AS I APPROACHED M VALDEMAR I MADE A KIND OF HALF EFFORT TO INFLUENCE HIS RIGHT ARM INTO PURSUIT OF MY OWN AS I PASSED THE LATTER GENTLY TO AND FRO ABOVE HIS PERSON
2988-7587-0052 IN SUCH EXPERIMENTS WITH THIS PATIENT
2988-7587-0053 AND ASSUREDLY I HAD LITTLE THOUGHT OF SUCCEEDING NOW BUT TO MY ASTONISHMENT HIS ARM VERY READILY ALTHOUGH FEEBLY FOLLOWED EVERY DIRECTION I ASSIGNED IT WITH MINE I DETERMINED TO HAZARD A FEW WORDS OF CONVERSATION
2988-7587-0054 M VALDEMAR I SAID ARE YOU ASLEEP HE MADE NO ANSWER BUT I PERCEIVED A TREMOR ABOUT THE LIPS AND WAS THUS INDUCED TO REPEAT THE QUESTION AGAIN AND AGAIN AT ITS THIRD REPETITION
2988-7587-0055 HIS WHOLE FRAME WAS AGITATED BY A VERY SLIGHT SHIVERING THE EYELIDS UNCLOSED THEMSELVES SO FAR AS TO DISPLAY A WHITE LINE OF THE BALL THE LIPS MOVED SLUGGISHLY AND FROM BETWEEN THEM IN A BARELY AUDIBLE WHISPER
2988-7587-0056 I QUESTIONED THE SLEEP WAKER AGAIN DO YOU STILL FEEL PAIN IN THE BREAST M VALDEMAR THE ANSWER NOW WAS IMMEDIATE BUT EVEN LESS AUDIBLE THAN BEFORE NO PAIN I AM DYING
2988-7587-0057 I DID NOT THINK IT ADVISABLE TO DISTURB HIM FARTHER JUST THEN AND NOTHING MORE WAS SAID OR DONE UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF DOCTOR F WHO CAME A LITTLE BEFORE SUNRISE
2988-7587-0058 AND EXPRESSED UNBOUNDED ASTONISHMENT AT FINDING THE PATIENT STILL ALIVE AFTER FEELING THE PULSE AND APPLYING A MIRROR TO THE LIPS HE REQUESTED ME TO SPEAK TO THE SLEEP WAKER AGAIN I DID SO SAYING M VALDEMAR DO YOU STILL SLEEP
2988-7587-0059 AS BEFORE SOME MINUTES ELAPSED ERE A REPLY WAS MADE AND DURING THE INTERVAL THE DYING MAN SEEMED TO BE COLLECTING HIS ENERGIES TO SPEAK AT MY FOURTH REPETITION OF THE QUESTION HE SAID VERY FAINTLY ALMOST INAUDIBLY
2988-7587-0060 YES STILL ASLEEP DYING IT WAS NOW THE OPINION OR RATHER THE WISH OF THE PHYSICIANS THAT M VALDEMAR SHOULD BE SUFFERED TO REMAIN UNDISTURBED IN HIS PRESENT APPARENTLY TRANQUIL CONDITION
2988-7587-0061 UNTIL DEATH SHOULD SUPERVENE AND THIS IT WAS GENERALLY AGREED MUST NOW TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW MINUTES I CONCLUDED HOWEVER TO SPEAK TO HIM ONCE MORE AND MERELY REPEATED MY PREVIOUS QUESTION
2988-7587-0062 THE EYES ROLLED THEMSELVES SLOWLY OPEN THE PUPILS DISAPPEARING UPWARDLY THE SKIN GENERALLY ASSUMED A CADAVEROUS HUE RESEMBLING NOT SO MUCH PARCHMENT AS WHITE PAPER
2988-7587-0063 AND THE CIRCULAR HECTIC SPOTS WHICH HITHERTO HAD BEEN STRONGLY DEFINED IN THE CENTRE OF EACH CHEEK WENT OUT AT ONCE I USE THIS EXPRESSION BECAUSE THE SUDDENNESS OF THEIR DEPARTURE
2988-7587-0064 PUT ME IN MIND OF NOTHING SO MUCH AS THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF A CANDLE BY A PUFF OF THE BREATH THE UPPER LIP AT THE SAME TIME WRITHED ITSELF AWAY FROM THE TEETH WHICH IT HAD PREVIOUSLY COVERED COMPLETELY WHILE THE LOWER JAW FELL WITH AN AUDIBLE JERK
2988-7587-0065 LEAVING THE MOUTH WIDELY EXTENDED AND DISCLOSING IN FULL VIEW THE SWOLLEN AND BLACKENED TONGUE I PRESUME THAT NO MEMBER OF THE PARTY THEN PRESENT HAD BEEN UNACCUSTOMED TO DEATH BED HORRORS BUT SO HIDEOUS BEYOND CONCEPTION
2988-7587-0066 WAS THE APPEARANCE OF M VALDEMAR AT THIS MOMENT THAT THERE WAS A GENERAL SHRINKING BACK FROM THE REGION OF THE BED
2988-7587-0067 WILL BE STARTLED INTO POSITIVE DISBELIEF IT IS MY BUSINESS HOWEVER SIMPLY TO PROCEED THERE WAS NO LONGER THE FAINTEST SIGN OF VITALITY IN M VALDEMAR AND CONCLUDING HIM TO BE DEAD WE WERE CONSIGNING HIM TO THE CHARGE OF THE NURSES
2988-7587-0068 A VOICE SUCH AS IT WOULD BE MADNESS IN ME TO ATTEMPT DESCRIBING THERE ARE INDEED TWO OR THREE EPITHETS WHICH MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS APPLICABLE TO IT IN PART I MIGHT SAY FOR EXAMPLE
2988-7587-0069 THAT THE SOUND WAS HARSH AND BROKEN AND HOLLOW BUT THE HIDEOUS WHOLE IS INDESCRIBABLE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT NO SIMILAR SOUNDS HAVE EVER JARRED UPON THE EAR OF HUMANITY
2988-7587-0070 THERE WERE TWO PARTICULARS NEVERTHELESS WHICH I THOUGHT THEN AND STILL THINK MIGHT FAIRLY BE STATED AS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE INTONATION AS WELL ADAPTED TO CONVEY SOME IDEA OF ITS UNEARTHLY PECULIARITY
2988-7587-0071 IN THE FIRST PLACE THE VOICE SEEMED TO REACH OUR EARS AT LEAST MINE FROM A VAST DISTANCE OR FROM SOME DEEP CAVERN WITHIN THE EARTH
2988-7587-0072 AS GELATINOUS OR GLUTINOUS MATTERS IMPRESS THE SENSE OF TOUCH I HAVE SPOKEN BOTH OF SOUND AND OF VOICE I MEAN TO SAY THAT THE SOUND WAS ONE OF DISTINCT OF EVEN WONDERFULLY THRILLINGLY DISTINCT
2988-7587-0073 SYLLABIFICATION M VALDEMAR SPOKE OBVIOUSLY IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION I HAD PROPOUNDED TO HIM A FEW MINUTES BEFORE I HAD ASKED HIM IT WILL BE REMEMBERED IF HE STILL SLEPT HE NOW SAID
2988-7587-0074 NO I HAVE BEEN SLEEPING
2988-7587-0075 NO PERSON PRESENT EVEN AFFECTED TO DENY
2988-7587-0076 WHICH THESE FEW WORDS THUS UTTERED WERE SO WELL CALCULATED TO CONVEY
2988-7587-0077 THE NURSES IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE CHAMBER AND COULD NOT BE INDUCED TO RETURN MY OWN IMPRESSIONS I WOULD NOT PRETEND TO RENDER INTELLIGIBLE TO THE READER FOR NEARLY AN HOUR
2988-7587-0078 WE BUSIED OURSELVES SILENTLY WITHOUT THE UTTERANCE OF A WORD
2988-7587-0079 WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF WE ADDRESSED OURSELVES AGAIN TO AN INVESTIGATION OF M VALDEMAR'S CONDITION IT REMAINED IN ALL RESPECTS AS I HAVE LAST DESCRIBED IT WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THE MIRROR NO LONGER AFFORDED EVIDENCE
2988-7587-0080 OF RESPIRATION AN ATTEMPT TO DRAW BLOOD FROM THE ARM FAILED I SHOULD MENTION TOO THAT THIS LIMB WAS NO FARTHER SUBJECT TO MY WILL I ENDEAVORED IN VAIN TO MAKE IT FOLLOW THE DIRECTION OF MY HAND
2988-7587-0081 THE ONLY REAL INDICATION INDEED OF THE MESMERIC INFLUENCE WAS NOW FOUND IN THE VIBRATORY MOVEMENT OF THE TONGUE
2988-7587-0082 TO QUERIES PUT TO HIM BY ANY OTHER PERSON THAN MYSELF HE SEEMED UTTERLY INSENSIBLE ALTHOUGH I ENDEAVORED TO PLACE EACH MEMBER OF THE COMPANY IN MESMERIC RAPPORT WITH HIM
2988-7587-0083 I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NOW RELATED ALL THAT IS NECESSARY
2988-7587-0084 IN THE AFTERNOON WE ALL CALLED AGAIN TO SEE THE PATIENT HIS CONDITION REMAINED PRECISELY THE SAME WE HAD NOW SOME DISCUSSION AS TO THE PROPRIETY AND FEASIBILITY OF AWAKENING HIM BUT WE HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY
2988-7587-0085 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SO FAR DEATH OR WHAT IS USUALLY TERMED DEATH HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE MESMERIC PROCESS IT SEEMED CLEAR TO US ALL
2988-7587-0086 TO INSURE HIS INSTANT OR AT LEAST HIS SPEEDY DISSOLUTION FROM THIS PERIOD UNTIL THE CLOSE OF LAST WEEK AN INTERVAL OF NEARLY SEVEN MONTHS WE CONTINUED TO MAKE DAILY CALLS AT M VALDEMAR'S HOUSE
2988-7587-0087 ACCOMPANIED NOW AND THEN BY MEDICAL AND OTHER FRIENDS ALL THIS TIME THE SLEEPER WAKER REMAINED EXACTLY AS I HAVE LAST DESCRIBED HIM THE NURSES ATTENTIONS WERE CONTINUAL IT WAS ON FRIDAY LAST
2988-7587-0088 WHICH HAS GIVEN RISE TO SO MUCH DISCUSSION IN PRIVATE CIRCLES TO SO MUCH OF WHAT I CANNOT HELP THINKING UNWARRANTED POPULAR FEELING
2988-7587-0089 I MADE USE OF THE CUSTOMARY PASSES
2988-7587-0090 THE FIRST INDICATION OF REVIVAL WAS AFFORDED BY A PARTIAL DESCENT OF THE IRIS IT WAS OBSERVED AS ESPECIALLY REMARKABLE THAT THIS LOWERING OF THE PUPIL WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE PROFUSE OUT FLOWING
2988-7587-0091 FROM BENEATH THE LIDS OF A PUNGENT AND HIGHLY OFFENSIVE ODOR IT WAS NOW SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE THE PATIENT'S ARM AS HERETOFORE I MADE THE ATTEMPT AND FAILED
2988-7587-0092 DOCTOR F THEN INTIMATED A DESIRE TO HAVE ME PUT A QUESTION I DID SO AS FOLLOWS M VALDEMAR CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS OR WISHES NOW
2988-7587-0093 THERE WAS AN INSTANT RETURN OF THE HECTIC CIRCLES ON THE CHEEKS THE TONGUE QUIVERED OR RATHER ROLLED VIOLENTLY IN THE MOUTH ALTHOUGH THE JAWS AND LIPS REMAINED RIGID AS BEFORE
2988-7587-0094 AND AT LENGTH THE SAME HIDEOUS VOICE WHICH I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED BROKE FORTH FOR GOD'S SAKE QUICK QUICK PUT ME TO SLEEP
2988-7587-0095 AND FOR AN INSTANT REMAINED UNDECIDED WHAT TO DO AT FIRST I MADE AN ENDEAVOR TO RE COMPOSE THE PATIENT BUT FAILING IN THIS THROUGH TOTAL ABEYANCE OF THE WILL I RETRACED MY STEPS AND AS EARNESTLY STRUGGLED TO AWAKEN HIM
2988-7587-0096 IN THIS ATTEMPT I SOON SAW THAT I SHOULD BE SUCCESSFUL OR AT LEAST I SOON FANCIED THAT MY SUCCESS WOULD BE COMPLETE AND I AM SURE THAT ALL IN THE ROOM WERE PREPARED TO SEE THE PATIENT AWAKEN
2988-7587-0097 FOR WHAT REALLY OCCURRED HOWEVER IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY HUMAN BEING COULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED AS I RAPIDLY MADE THE MESMERIC PASSES AMID EJACULATIONS OF
2988-7587-0098 AND NOT FROM THE LIPS OF THE SUFFERER HIS WHOLE FRAME AT ONCE WITHIN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE MINUTE
2988-7587-0099 CRUMBLED ABSOLUTELY ROTTED AWAY BENEATH MY HANDS UPON THE BED BEFORE THAT WHOLE COMPANY THERE LAY A NEARLY LIQUID MASS OF LOATHSOME OF DETESTABLE
