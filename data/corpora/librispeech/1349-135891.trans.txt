1349-135891-0009 WHEN THE PORTER HAD PUT ALL THESE THINGS INTO HIS BASKET AND PERCEIVED THAT IT GREW FULL MY GOOD LADY SAID HE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE GIVEN ME NOTICE THAT YOU HAD SO MUCH PROVISION TO CARRY AND THEN I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT A HORSE OR RATHER A CAMEL FOR THE PURPOSE
1349-135891-0010 FOR IF YOU BUY EVER SO LITTLE MORE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO BEAR IT THE LADY LAUGHED AT THE FELLOW'S PLEASANT HUMOUR AND ORDERED HIM STILL TO FOLLOW HER
1349-135891-0011 SHE THEN WENT TO A DRUGGIST WHERE SHE FURNISHED HERSELF WITH ALL MANNER OF SWEET SCENTED WATERS CLOVES MUSK PEPPER GINGER AND A GREAT PIECE OF AMBERGRIS AND SEVERAL OTHER INDIAN SPICES THIS QUITE FILLED THE PORTER'S BASKET AND SHE ORDERED HIM TO FOLLOW HER
1349-135891-0012 THEY WALKED TILL THEY CAME TO A MAGNIFICENT HOUSE WHOSE FRONT WAS ADORNED WITH FINE COLUMNS AND HAD A GATE OF IVORY THERE THEY STOPPED AND THE LADY KNOCKED SOFTLY WHILE THE YOUNG LADY AND THE PORTER WAITED FOR THE OPENING OF THE GATE THE PORTER
1349-135891-0013 MADE A THOUSAND REFLECTIONS HE WONDERED THAT SUCH A FINE LADY SHOULD COME ABROAD TO BUY PROVISIONS HE CONCLUDED SHE COULD NOT BE A SLAVE HER AIR WAS TOO NOBLE AND THEREFORE HE THOUGHT SHE MUST NEEDS BE A WOMAN OF QUALITY
1349-135891-0014 JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK HER SOME QUESTIONS UPON THIS HEAD ANOTHER LADY CAME TO OPEN THE GATE AND APPEARED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY SURPRISED OR RATHER SO MUCH STRUCK WITH HER CHARMS
1349-135891-0015 THAT HE HAD NEARLY SUFFERED HIS BASKET TO FALL FOR HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BEAUTY THAT EQUALLED HER THE LADY WHO BROUGHT THE PORTER WITH HER PERCEIVING HIS DISORDER AND KNOWING THE CAUSE WAS GREATLY DIVERTED AND TOOK SO MUCH PLEASURE IN WATCHING HIS LOOKS
1349-135891-0016 THAT SHE FORGOT THE GATE WAS OPENED PRAY SISTER SAID THE BEAUTIFUL PORTRESS COME IN WHAT DO YOU STAY FOR
1349-135891-0017 THAT HE IS SCARCELY ABLE TO STAND
1349-135891-0018 ENCOMPASSED WITH AN OPEN GALLERY WHICH HAD A COMMUNICATION WITH SEVERAL APARTMENTS OF EXTRAORDINARY MAGNIFICENCE
1349-135891-0019 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE COURT THERE WAS A PLATFORM RICHLY FURNISHED WITH A THRONE OF AMBER IN THE MIDDLE SUPPORTED BY FOUR COLUMNS OF EBONY ENRICHED WITH DIAMONDS AND PEARLS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY SIZE AND COVERED WITH RED SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH INDIAN GOLD OF ADMIRABLE WORKMANSHIP
1349-135891-0020 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT THERE WAS A FOUNTAIN FACED WITH WHITE MARBLE AND FULL OF CLEAR WATER WHICH WAS COPIOUSLY SUPPLIED OUT OF THE MOUTH OF A LION OF BRASS THE PORTER THOUGH HEAVY LADEN COULD NOT BUT ADMIRE THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THIS HOUSE
1349-135891-0021 AND THE EXCELLENT ORDER IN WHICH EVERY THING WAS PLACED BUT WHAT PARTICULARLY CAPTIVATED HIS ATTENTION WAS A THIRD LADY WHO SEEMED TO BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE SECOND AND WAS SEATED UPON THE THRONE JUST MENTIONED
1349-135891-0022 SHE DESCENDED AS SOON AS SHE SAW THE TWO OTHERS AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THEM HE JUDGED BY THE RESPECT WHICH THE OTHER LADIES SHOWED HER THAT SHE WAS THE CHIEF IN WHICH HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN
1349-135891-0023 AND SHE WHO WENT TO BUY THE PROVISIONS WAS NAMED AMENE
1349-135891-0024 THEN AMENE AND SAFIE TOOK THE BASKET THE ONE BEFORE AND THE OTHER BEHIND ZOBEIDE ALSO ASSISTED
1349-135891-0025 THEN EMPTIED IT AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE THE BEAUTIFUL AMENE TOOK OUT MONEY AND PAID THE PORTER LIBERALLY THE PORTER WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED BUT WHEN HE OUGHT TO HAVE DEPARTED HE COULD NOT SUMMON SUFFICIENT RESOLUTION FOR THE PURPOSE
1349-135891-0026 HE WAS CHAINED TO THE SPOT BY THE PLEASURE OF BEHOLDING THREE SUCH BEAUTIES WHO APPEARED TO HIM EQUALLY CHARMING FOR AMENE HAVING NOW LAID ASIDE HER VEIL PROVED TO BE AS HANDSOME AS EITHER OF THE OTHERS
1349-135891-0027 WHAT SURPRISED HIM MOST WAS THAT HE SAW NO MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE YET MOST OF THE PROVISIONS HE HAD BROUGHT IN AS THE DRY FRUITS AND THE SEVERAL SORTS OF CAKES AND CONFECTIONS WERE ADAPTED CHIEFLY FOR THOSE WHO COULD DRINK AND MAKE MERRY
1349-135891-0028 AND TURNING TO AMENE SHE CONTINUED SISTER GIVE HIM SOMETHING MORE THAT HE MAY DEPART SATISFIED MADAM REPLIED THE PORTER IT IS NOT THAT WHICH DETAINS ME I AM ALREADY MORE THAN PAID FOR MY SERVICES I AM SENSIBLE THAT I ACT RUDELY IN STAYING LONGER THAN I OUGHT
1349-135891-0029 THAT I AM ASTONISHED NOT TO SEE A MAN WITH THREE LADIES OF SUCH EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY AND YOU KNOW THAT A COMPANY OF WOMEN WITHOUT MEN IS AS MELANCHOLY AS A COMPANY OF MEN WITHOUT WOMEN TO THIS HE ADDED SEVERAL OTHER PLEASANT THINGS TO PROVE WHAT HE SAID
1349-135891-0030 AND DID NOT FORGET THE BAGDAD PROVERB THAT THE TABLE IS NOT COMPLETELY FURNISHED EXCEPT THERE BE FOUR IN COMPANY AND SO CONCLUDED THAT SINCE THEY WERE BUT THREE THEY WANTED ANOTHER

1349-135891-0032 WE HAVE BUT TOO MUCH REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS OF ACQUAINTING INDISCREET PERSONS WITH OUR COUNSEL AND A GOOD AUTHOR THAT WE HAVE READ SAYS KEEP THY OWN SECRET AND DO NOT REVEAL IT TO ANY ONE HE THAT MAKES HIS SECRET KNOWN IT NO LONGER ITS MASTER
1349-135891-0033 IF THY OWN BREAST CANNOT KEEP THY COUNSEL HOW CANST THOU EXPECT THE BREAST OF ANOTHER TO BE MORE FAITHFUL MY LADIES REPLIED THE PORTER BY YOUR VERY AIR I JUDGED AT FIRST THAT YOU WERE PERSONS OF EXTRAORDINARY MERIT
1349-135891-0034 AND I CONCEIVE THAT I AM NOT MISTAKEN THOUGH FORTUNE HAS NOT GIVEN ME WEALTH ENOUGH TO RAISE ME ABOVE MY MEAN PROFESSION YET I HAVE NOT OMITTED TO CULTIVATE MY MIND AS MUCH AS I COULD BY READING BOOKS OF SCIENCE AND HISTORY AND ALLOW ME I BESEECH YOU
1349-135891-0035 TO SAY THAT I HAVE ALSO READ IN ANOTHER AUTHOR A MAXIM WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS HAPPILY FOLLOWED WE CONCEAL OUR SECRET FROM SUCH PERSONS ONLY AS ARE KNOWN TO ALL THE WORLD TO WANT DISCRETION
1349-135891-0036 AND WOULD ABUSE OUR CONFIDENCE BUT WE HESITATE NOT TO DISCOVER IT TO THE PRUDENT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WITH THEM IT IS SAFE

1349-135891-0040 THE PORTER NOTWITHSTANDING HIS RHETORIC MUST IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE RETIRED IN CONFUSION IF AMENE HAD NOT TAKEN HIS PART AND SAID TO ZOBEIDE AND SAFIE MY DEAR SISTERS I CONJURE YOU TO LET HIM REMAIN I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT HE WILL AFFORD US SOME DIVERSION
1349-135891-0041 OF THIS YOU PERCEIVE HE IS CAPABLE I ASSURE YOU HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIS READINESS HIS ALACRITY AND COURAGE TO FOLLOW ME I COULD NOT HAVE DONE SO MUCH BUSINESS IN SO SHORT A TIME
