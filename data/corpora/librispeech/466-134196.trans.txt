466-134196-0000 BUT IF ANY ONE WERE TO ASK ME WHERE FRAUD AND HYPOCRISY MIGHT TRULY BE FOUND I SHOULD KNOW OF NO OTHER PLACE TO NAME THAN THE COURT WHERE DETRACTION ALWAYS WEARS THE MASK OF AMUSEMENT WHERE AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE CUT AND SEW UP WOUND AND HEAL
466-134196-0001 BREAK AND GLUE TOGETHER OF WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU ONE INSTANCE IN THE STORY THAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING OF WIDE RIVER AN EXCELLENT YOUTH NAMED CORVETTO WHO FOR HIS GOOD CONDUCT
466-134196-0002 WAS BELOVED BY HIS MASTER AND FOR THIS VERY CAUSE WAS DISLIKED AND HATED BY ALL THE COURTIERS THESE COURTIERS WERE FILLED WITH SPITE AND MALICE AND BURSTING WITH ENVY AT THE KINDNESS WHICH THE KING SHOWED TO CORVETTO
466-134196-0003 SO THAT ALL DAY LONG IN EVERY CORNER OF THE PALACE THEY DID NOTHING BUT TATTLE AND WHISPER MURMUR AND GRUMBLE AT THE POOR LAD SAYING WHAT SORCERY HAS THIS FELLOW PRACTISED ON THE KING THAT HE TAKES SUCH A FANCY TO HIM
466-134196-0004 HOW COMES HE BY THIS LUCK THAT NOT A DAY PASSES THAT HE RECEIVES SOME NEW FAVOURS WHILST WE ARE FOR EVER GOING BACKWARD LIKE A ROPE MAKER AND GETTING FROM BAD TO WORSE THOUGH WE SLAVE LIKE DOGS TOIL LIKE FIELD LABOURERS
466-134196-0005 AND RUN ABOUT LIKE DEER TO HIT THE KING'S PLEASURE TO A HAIR TRULY ONE MUST BE BORN TO GOOD FORTUNE IN THIS WORLD AND HE WHO HAS NOT LUCK MIGHT AS WELL BE THROWN INTO THE SEA WHAT IS TO BE DONE WE CAN ONLY LOOK ON AND ENVY
466-134196-0006 THESE AND OTHER WORDS FELL FROM THEIR MOUTHS LIKE POISONED ARROWS AIMED AT THE RUIN OF CORVETTO AS AT A TARGET ALAS FOR HIM WHO IS CONDEMNED TO THAT DEN THE COURT WHERE FLATTERY IS SOLD BY THE KILDERKIN
466-134196-0007 MALIGNITY AND ILL OFFICES ARE MEASURED OUT IN BUSHELS DECEIT AND TREACHERY ARE WEIGHED BY THE TON BUT WHO CAN COUNT ALL THE ATTEMPTS THESE COURTIERS MADE TO BRING HIM TO GRIEF
466-134196-0008 BUT CORVETTO WHO WAS ENCHANTED AND PERCEIVED THE TRAPS AND DISCOVERED THE TRICKS WAS AWARE OF ALL THE INTRIGUES AND THE AMBUSCADES THE PLOTS AND CONSPIRACIES OF HIS ENEMIES HE KEPT HIS EARS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT AND HIS EYES OPEN
466-134196-0009 IN ORDER NOT TO TAKE A FALSE STEP WELL KNOWING THAT THE FORTUNE OF COURTIERS IS AS GLASS BUT THE HIGHER THE LAD CONTINUED TO RISE THE LOWER THE OTHERS FELL TILL AT LAST BEING PUZZLED TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS FEET
466-134196-0010 AS THEIR SLANDER WAS NOT BELIEVED THEY THOUGHT OF LEADING HIM TO DISASTER BY THE PATH OF FLATTERY WHICH THEY ATTEMPTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TEN MILES DISTANT FROM SCOTLAND WHERE THE SEAT OF THIS KING WAS
466-134196-0011 THERE DWELT AN OGRE THE MOST INHUMAN AND SAVAGE THAT HAD EVER BEEN IN OGRELAND WHO BEING PERSECUTED BY THE KING HAD FORTIFIED HIMSELF IN A LONESOME WOOD ON THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHERE NO BIRD EVER FLEW AND WAS SO THICK AND TANGLED
466-134196-0012 THAT ONE COULD NEVER SEE THE SUN THERE THIS OGRE HAD A MOST BEAUTIFUL HORSE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT WERE FORMED WITH A PENCIL AND AMONGST OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS IT COULD SPEAK LIKE ANY MAN
466-134196-0013 NOW THE COURTIERS WHO KNEW HOW WICKED THE OGRE WAS HOW THICK THE WOOD HOW HIGH THE MOUNTAIN AND HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO GET AT THE HORSE WENT TO THE KING
466-134196-0014 WHICH WAS A THING WORTHY OF A KING ADDED THAT HE OUGHT TO ENDEAVOUR BY ALL MEANS TO GET IT OUT OF THE OGRE'S CLAWS AND THAT CORVETTO WAS JUST THE LAD TO DO THIS AS HE WAS EXPERT AND CLEVER AT ESCAPING OUT OF THE FIRE
466-134196-0015 THE KING WHO KNEW NOT THAT UNDER THE FLOWERS OF THESE WORDS A SERPENT WAS CONCEALED INSTANTLY CALLED CORVETTO AND SAID TO HIM IF YOU LOVE ME SEE THAT IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER YOU OBTAIN FOR ME THE HORSE OF MY ENEMY THE OGRE
466-134196-0016 AND YOU SHALL HAVE NO CAUSE TO REGRET HAVING DONE ME THIS SERVICE CORVETTO KNEW WELL THAT THIS DRUM WAS SOUNDED BY THOSE WHO WISHED HIM ILL NEVERTHELESS TO OBEY THE KING HE SET OUT AND TOOK THE ROAD TO THE MOUNTAIN
466-134196-0017 THEN GOING VERY QUIETLY TO THE OGRE'S STABLE HE SADDLED AND MOUNTED THE HORSE AND FIXING HIS FEET FIRMLY IN THE STIRRUP TOOK HIS WAY BACK BUT AS SOON AS THE HORSE SAW HIMSELF SPURRED OUT OF THE PALACE HE CRIED ALOUD HOLLO
466-134196-0018 BE ON YOUR GUARD CORVETTO IS RIDING OFF WITH ME AT THIS ALARM THE OGRE INSTANTLY SET OUT WITH ALL THE ANIMALS THAT SERVED HIM TO CUT CORVETTO IN PIECES FROM THIS SIDE JUMPED AN APE
466-134196-0019 FROM THAT WAS SEEN A LARGE BEAR HERE SPRANG FORTH A LION THERE CAME RUNNING A WOLF BUT THE YOUTH BY THE AID OF BRIDLE AND SPUR DISTANCED THE MOUNTAIN AND GALLOPING WITHOUT STOP TO THE CITY
466-134196-0020 ARRIVED AT THE COURT WHERE HE PRESENTED THE HORSE TO THE KING THEN THE KING EMBRACED HIM MORE THAN A SON AND PULLING OUT HIS PURSE FILLED HIS HANDS WITH CROWN PIECES AT THIS THE RAGE OF THE COURTIERS KNEW NO BOUNDS
466-134196-0021 AND WHEREAS AT FIRST THEY WERE PUFFED UP WITH A LITTLE PIPE THEY WERE NOW BURSTING WITH THE BLASTS OF A SMITH'S BELLOWS SEEING THAT THE CROWBARS WITH WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO LAY CORVETTO'S GOOD FORTUNE IN RUINS ONLY SERVED TO SMOOTH THE ROAD TO HIS PROSPERITY
466-134196-0022 KNOWING HOWEVER THAT WALLS ARE NOT LEVELLED BY THE FIRST ATTACK OF THE BATTERING RAM THEY RESOLVED TO TRY THEIR LUCK A SECOND TIME AND SAID TO THE KING WE WISH YOU JOY OF THE BEAUTIFUL HORSE IT WILL INDEED BE AN ORNAMENT TO THE ROYAL STABLE
466-134196-0023 BUT WHAT A PITY YOU HAVE NOT THE OGRE'S TAPESTRY WHICH IS A THING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WORDS CAN TELL AND WOULD SPREAD YOUR FAME FAR AND WIDE THERE IS NO ONE HOWEVER ABLE TO PROCURE THIS TREASURE BUT CORVETTO WHO IS JUST THE LAD TO DO SUCH A KIND OF SERVICE
466-134196-0024 AND IN FOUR SECONDS WAS ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE OGRE LIVED THEN PASSING UNSEEN INTO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH HE SLEPT HE HID HIMSELF UNDER THE BED AND WAITED AS STILL AS A MOUSE UNTIL NIGHT TO MAKE THE STARS LAUGH
466-134196-0025 PUTS A CARNIVAL MASK ON THE FACE OF THE SKY AND AS SOON AS THE OGRE AND HIS WIFE WERE GONE TO BED CORVETTO STRIPPED THE WALLS OF THE CHAMBER VERY QUIETLY AND WISHING TO STEAL THE COUNTERPANE OF THE BED LIKEWISE HE BEGAN TO PULL IT GENTLY
466-134196-0026 THEREUPON THE OGRE SUDDENLY STARTING UP TOLD HIS WIFE NOT TO PULL SO FOR SHE WAS DRAGGING ALL THE CLOTHES OFF HIM AND WOULD GIVE HIM HIS DEATH OF COLD
466-134196-0027 WHERE IS THE COUNTERPANE REPLIED THE OGRE AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO THE FLOOR HE TOUCHED CORVETTO'S FACE WHEREUPON HE SET UP A LOUD CRY THE IMP THE IMP HOLLO HERE LIGHTS RUN QUICKLY
466-134196-0028 TILL THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS TURNED TOPSY TURVY WITH THE NOISE BUT CORVETTO AFTER THROWING THE CLOTHES OUT OF THE WINDOW LET HIMSELF DROP DOWN UPON THEM THEN MAKING UP A GOOD BUNDLE HE SET OUT ON THE ROAD TO THE CITY
466-134196-0029 WHERE THE RECEPTION HE MET WITH FROM THE KING AND THE VEXATION OF THE COURTIERS WHO WERE BURSTING WITH SPITE ARE NOT TO BE TOLD NEVERTHELESS THEY LAID A PLAN TO FALL UPON CORVETTO WITH THE REAR GUARD OF THEIR ROGUERY AND WENT AGAIN TO THE KING
466-134196-0030 WHO WAS ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT AT THE TAPESTRY WHICH WAS NOT ONLY OF SILK EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD BUT HAD BESIDES MORE THAN A THOUSAND DEVICES AND THOUGHTS WORKED ON IT AND AMONGST THE REST IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
466-134196-0031 THERE WAS A COCK IN THE ACT OF CROWING AT DAYBREAK AND OUT OF ITS MOUTH WAS SEEN COMING A MOTTO IN TUSCAN IF I ONLY SEE YOU AND IN ANOTHER PART A DROOPING HELIOTROPE WITH A TUSCAN MOTTO AT SUNSET
466-134196-0032 WITH SO MANY OTHER PRETTY THINGS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A BETTER MEMORY AND MORE TIME THAN I HAVE TO RELATE THEM WHEN THE COURTIERS CAME TO THE KING WHO WAS THUS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY THEY SAID TO HIM
466-134196-0033 AS CORVETTO HAS DONE SO MUCH TO SERVE YOU IT WOULD BE NO GREAT MATTER FOR HIM IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU A SIGNAL PLEASURE TO GET THE OGRE'S PALACE WHICH IS FIT FOR AN EMPEROR TO LIVE IN FOR IT HAS SO MANY ROOMS AND CHAMBERS INSIDE AND OUT
466-134196-0034 THAT IT CAN HOLD AN ARMY AND YOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE ALL THE COURTYARDS PORTICOES COLONNADES BALCONIES AND SPIRAL CHIMNEYS WHICH THERE ARE BUILT WITH SUCH MARVELLOUS ARCHITECTURE THAT ART PRIDES HERSELF UPON THEM NATURE IS ABASHED
466-134196-0035 AND STUPOR IS IN DELIGHT THE KING WHO HAD A FRUITFUL BRAIN WHICH CONCEIVED QUICKLY CALLED CORVETTO AGAIN AND TELLING HIM THE GREAT LONGING THAT HAD SEIZED HIM FOR THE OGRE'S PALACE BEGGED HIM TO ADD THIS SERVICE TO ALL THE OTHERS HE HAD DONE HIM
466-134196-0036 PROMISING TO SCORE IT UP WITH THE CHALK OF GRATITUDE AT THE TAVERN OF MEMORY SO CORVETTO INSTANTLY SET OUT HEELS OVER HEAD AND ARRIVING AT THE OGRE'S PALACE HE FOUND THAT THE OGRESS WHILST HER HUSBAND WAS GONE TO INVITE THE KINSFOLK
466-134196-0037 WAS BUSYING HERSELF WITH PREPARING THE FEAST THEN CORVETTO ENTERING WITH A LOOK OF COMPASSION SAID GOOD DAY MY GOOD WOMAN
466-134196-0038 ONLY YESTERDAY YOU WERE ILL IN BED AND NOW YOU ARE SLAVING THUS AND HAVE NO PITY ON YOUR OWN FLESH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO REPLIED THE OGRESS I HAVE NO ONE TO HELP ME I AM HERE
466-134196-0039 READY TO HELP YOU TOOTH AND NAIL WELCOME THEN SAID THE OGRESS AND AS YOU PROFFER ME SO MUCH KINDNESS JUST HELP ME TO SPLIT FOUR LOGS OF WOOD
466-134196-0040 BUT IF FOUR LOGS ARE NOT ENOW LET ME SPLIT FIVE AND TAKING UP A NEWLY GROUND AXE INSTEAD OF STRIKING THE WOOD HE STRUCK THE OGRESS ON THE NECK AND MADE HER FALL TO THE GROUND LIKE A PEAR THEN RUNNING QUICKLY TO THE GATE
466-134196-0041 HE DUG A DEEP HOLE BEFORE THE ENTRANCE AND COVERING IT OVER WITH BUSHES AND EARTH HE HID HIMSELF BEHIND THE GATE AS SOON AS CORVETTO SAW THE OGRE COMING WITH HIS KINSFOLK HE SET UP A LOUD CRY IN THE COURTYARD STOP STOP
466-134196-0042 I'VE CAUGHT HIM AND
466-134196-0043 WHEN THE OGRE HEARD THIS CHALLENGE HE RAN LIKE MAD AT CORVETTO TO MAKE A HASH OF HIM BUT RUSHING FURIOUSLY TOWARDS THE GATE DOWN HE TUMBLED WITH ALL HIS COMPANIONS HEAD OVER HEELS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT
466-134196-0044 WHERE CORVETTO SPEEDILY STONED THEM TO DEATH THEN HE SHUT THE DOOR AND TOOK THE KEYS TO THE KING WHO SEEING THE VALOUR AND CLEVERNESS OF THE LAD IN SPITE OF ILL FORTUNE AND THE ENVY AND ANNOYANCE OF THE COURTIERS GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER TO WIFE
