6399-278846-0000 A DIGRESSION IN PRAISE OF DIGRESSIONS
6399-278846-0001 BUT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE WORLD IS CHIEFLY INDEBTED I SHALL LEAVE AMONG THE CURIOUS AS A PROBLEM WORTHY OF THEIR UTMOST INQUIRY FOR THE INVENTION OF THE LATTER I THINK THE COMMONWEALTH OF LEARNING IS CHIEFLY OBLIGED
6399-278846-0002 WHICH AMONG MEN OF A JUDICIOUS TASTE ARE DRESSED UP
6399-278846-0003 IT IS TRUE THERE IS A SORT OF MOROSE DETRACTING ILL BRED PEOPLE WHO PRETEND UTTERLY TO DISRELISH THESE POLITE INNOVATIONS
6399-278846-0004 AND AS TO THE SIMILITUDE FROM DIET THEY ALLOW THE PARALLEL BUT ARE SO BOLD AS TO PRONOUNCE THE EXAMPLE ITSELF A CORRUPTION
6399-278846-0005 THEY TELL US THAT THE FASHION OF JUMBLING FIFTY THINGS TOGETHER IN A DISH WAS AT FIRST INTRODUCED IN COMPLIANCE TO A DEPRAVED AND DEBAUCHED APPETITE AS WELL AS TO A CRAZY CONSTITUTION
6399-278846-0006 IS A SIGN HE WANTS A STOMACH AND DIGESTION FOR MORE SUBSTANTIAL VICTUALS FURTHER THEY AFFIRM THAT DIGRESSIONS IN A BOOK ARE LIKE FOREIGN TROOPS IN A STATE WHICH ARGUE THE NATION TO WANT A HEART AND HANDS OF ITS OWN
6399-278846-0007 AND OFTEN EITHER SUBDUE THE NATIVES OR DRIVE THEM INTO THE MOST UNFRUITFUL CORNERS BUT AFTER ALL THAT CAN BE OBJECTED BY THESE SUPERCILIOUS CENSORS IT IS MANIFEST THE SOCIETY OF WRITERS WOULD QUICKLY BE REDUCED TO A VERY
6399-278846-0008 IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WERE THE CASE THE SAME AMONG US AS WITH THE GREEKS AND ROMANS WHEN LEARNING WAS IN ITS CRADLE TO BE REARED AND FED AND CLOTHED BY INVENTION IT WOULD BE AN EASY TASK TO FILL UP VOLUMES UPON
6399-278846-0009 PARTICULAR OCCASIONS WITHOUT FURTHER EXPATIATING FROM THE SUBJECT THAN BY MODERATE EXCURSIONS HELPING TO ADVANCE OR CLEAR THE MAIN DESIGN BUT WITH KNOWLEDGE IT HAS FARED AS
6399-278846-0010 THEY SEND TO FORAGE MANY A MILE AMONG FRIENDS OR ENEMIES IT MATTERS NOT MEANWHILE THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS TRAMPLED AND BEATEN DOWN BECOME BARREN AND DRY
6399-278846-0011 THE WHOLE COURSE OF THINGS BEING THUS ENTIRELY CHANGED BETWEEN US AND THE ANCIENTS AND THE MODERNS WISELY SENSIBLE OF IT
6399-278846-0012 THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED WAY OF USING BOOKS AT PRESENT IS TWOFOLD EITHER FIRST TO SERVE THEM AS SOME MEN DO LORDS LEARN THEIR TITLES EXACTLY AND THEN BRAG OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
6399-278846-0013 THEREFORE MEN OF MUCH HASTE AND LITTLE CEREMONY ARE CONTENT TO GET IN BY THE BACK DOOR FOR THE ARTS ARE ALL IN A FLYING MARCH AND THEREFORE MORE EASILY SUBDUED BY ATTACKING THEM IN THE REAR THUS PHYSICIANS DISCOVER THE STATE
6399-278846-0014 OF THE WHOLE BODY BY CONSULTING ONLY WHAT COMES FROM BEHIND THUS MEN CATCH KNOWLEDGE BY THROWING THEIR WIT ON THE POSTERIORS OF A BOOK AS BOYS DO SPARROWS WITH FLINGING SALT UPON THEIR TAILS THUS HUMAN LIFE IS BEST UNDERSTOOD
6399-278846-0015 BY THE WISE MAN'S RULE OF REGARDING THE END THUS ARE THE SCIENCES FOUND LIKE HERCULES OXEN BY TRACING THEM BACKWARDS
6399-278846-0016 SO THAT A VIEW OR A MUSTER MAY BE TAKEN OF IT WITH ABUNDANCE OF EXPEDITION FOR THIS GREAT BLESSING WE ARE WHOLLY INDEBTED TO SYSTEMS AND ABSTRACTS IN WHICH THE MODERN FATHERS OF LEARNING LIKE PRUDENT USURERS
6399-278846-0017 HAPPINESS OF OUR NOBLE AGE TO GATHER THE FRUIT NOW THE METHOD OF GROWING WISE LEARNED AND SUBLIME HAVING BECOME SO REGULAR AN AFFAIR AND SO ESTABLISHED IN ALL ITS FORMS THE NUMBER OF WRITERS MUST NEEDS HAVE INCREASED ACCORDINGLY
6399-278846-0018 WITH EACH OTHER BESIDES IT IS RECKONED THAT THERE IS NOT AT THIS PRESENT A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF NEW MATTER LEFT IN NATURE TO FURNISH AND ADORN ANY ONE PARTICULAR SUBJECT TO THE EXTENT OF A VOLUME
6399-278846-0019 THIS I AM TOLD BY A VERY SKILFUL COMPUTER WHO HATH GIVEN A FULL DEMONSTRATION OF IT FROM RULES OF ARITHMETIC THIS PERHAPS MAY BE OBJECTED AGAINST BY THOSE WHO MAINTAIN THE INFINITY OF MATTER
6399-278846-0020 AND THEREFORE WILL NOT ALLOW THAT ANY SPECIES OF IT CAN BE EXHAUSTED FOR ANSWER TO WHICH LET US EXAMINE THE NOBLEST BRANCH OF MODERN WIT OR INVENTION PLANTED AND CULTIVATED BY THE PRESENT AGE
6399-278846-0021 AND WHICH OF ALL OTHERS HATH BORNE THE MOST AND THE FAIREST FRUIT FOR THOUGH SOME REMAINS OF IT WERE LEFT US BY THE ANCIENTS YET HAVE NOT ANY OF THOSE AS I REMEMBER
6399-278846-0022 BEEN TRANSLATED OR COMPILED INTO SYSTEMS FOR MODERN USE THEREFORE WE MAY AFFIRM TO OUR OWN HONOUR THAT IT HAS IN SOME SORT BEEN BOTH INVENTED AND BROUGHT TO A PERFECTION BY THE SAME HANDS
6399-278846-0023 WHAT I MEAN IS THAT HIGHLY CELEBRATED TALENT AMONG THE MODERN WITS OF DEDUCING SIMILITUDES ALLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS VERY SURPRISING AGREEABLE AND APPOSITE FROM THE SIGNS OF EITHER SEX TOGETHER WITH THEIR PROPER USES
6399-278846-0024 AND TRULY HAVING OBSERVED HOW LITTLE INVENTION BEARS ANY VOGUE BESIDES WHAT IS DERIVED INTO THESE CHANNELS I HAVE SOMETIMES HAD A THOUGHT THAT THE HAPPY GENIUS OF OUR AGE AND
6399-278846-0025 PERTINGENTIA NOW I HAVE BEEN VERY CURIOUS TO INSPECT THE LATE PRODUCTIONS WHEREIN THE BEAUTIES OF THIS KIND
6399-278846-0026 AND ALL ENDEAVOURS HAVE BEEN USED
6399-278846-0027 OF THEIR MARES THAT THEY MIGHT YIELD THE MORE MILK YET I AM UNDER AN APPREHENSION IT IS NEAR GROWING DRY AND PAST ALL RECOVERY AND THAT EITHER SOME NEW FONDE OF WIT SHOULD IF POSSIBLE BE PROVIDED
6399-278846-0028 OR ELSE THAT WE MUST E E N BE CONTENT WITH REPETITION HERE AS WELL AS UPON ALL OTHER OCCASIONS THIS WILL STAND AS AN UNCONTESTABLE ARGUMENT THAT OUR MODERN WITS
6399-278846-0029 WHAT REMAINS THEREFORE BUT THAT OUR LAST RECOURSE MUST BE HAD TO LARGE INDEXES AND LITTLE COMPENDIUMS QUOTATIONS MUST BE PLENTIFULLY GATHERED AND BOOKED IN ALPHABET TO THIS END THOUGH AUTHORS NEED BE LITTLE CONSULTED
6399-278846-0030 YET CRITICS AND COMMENTATORS AND LEXICONS CAREFULLY MUST BUT ABOVE ALL THOSE JUDICIOUS COLLECTORS OF BRIGHT PARTS AND FLOWERS AND OBSERVANDAS ARE TO BE NICELY DWELT ON BY SOME CALLED THE SIEVES AND BOULTERS OF LEARNING
6399-278846-0031 THOUGH IT IS LEFT UNDETERMINED WHETHER THEY DEALT IN PEARLS OR MEAL
6399-278846-0032 OR WHAT STAYED BEHIND BY THESE METHODS IN A FEW WEEKS THERE STARTS UP MANY A WRITER CAPABLE OF MANAGING THE PROFOUNDEST AND MOST UNIVERSAL SUBJECTS FOR WHAT THOUGH HIS HEAD BE EMPTY PROVIDED HIS COMMONPLACE BOOK BE FULL AND IF
6399-278846-0033 YOU WILL BATE HIM BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF METHOD AND STYLE AND GRAMMAR AND INVENTION ALLOW HIM BUT THE COMMON PRIVILEGES OF TRANSCRIBING FROM OTHERS AND DIGRESSING FROM HIMSELF AS OFTEN AS HE SHALL SEE OCCASION
6399-278846-0034 HE WILL DESIRE NO MORE INGREDIENTS TOWARDS FITTING UP A TREATISE THAT SHALL MAKE A VERY COMELY FIGURE ON A BOOKSELLER'S SHELF
6399-278846-0035 ADORNED WITH THE HERALDRY OF ITS TITLE FAIRLY INSCRIBED ON A LABEL NEVER TO BE THUMBED OR GREASED BY STUDENTS NOR BOUND TO EVERLASTING
