6030-57826-0000 ROBERTS THE WEAK BOY WITH THE STRONG WILL WHEN ONE IS PICKING OUT SOLDIERS ONE USUALLY CHOOSES BIG MEN YOU SEE A STRAPPING FELLOW GOING BY IN REGIMENTALS AND YOU SAY MY WHAT A DANDY SOLDIER
6030-57826-0001 SUCH AS WASHINGTON BUT IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT MANY OF OUR GREAT GENERALS HAVE BEEN UNDERSIZED SUCH WERE GRANT WELLINGTON AND NAPOLEON SUCH WAS LORD ROBERTS WHO BECAME EARL AND MARSHAL
6030-57826-0002 AND WAS ONE OF THE BEST LOVED LEADERS THAT ENGLAND HAS PRODUCED HE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH TWO GREAT CAMPAIGNS TO EXTEND THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN INDIA AND SOUTH AFRICA AND PASSED AWAY IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT WORLD WAR WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF KITCHENER
6030-57826-0003 ROBERTS HIMSELF HAS LEFT AN ENTERTAINING STORY OF HIS LIFE IN FORTY ONE YEARS IN INDIA WHICH SHOWS THAT A SOLDIER'S LIFE IS NOT TINSEL AND PARADE BUT IS MADE UP OF INFINITE HARDSHIP THE WEAK BOY MUST INDEED HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG WILL IN ORDER TO PULL THROUGH
6030-57826-0004 FREDERICK ROBERTS WAS BORN IN INDIA AT A TIME WHEN HIS FATHER ABRAHAM ROBERTS WAS LIEUTENANT COLONEL OF INFANTRY AT CAWNPORE THIS FINE OLD SOLDIER GAVE A LIFE TIME OF SERVICE TO THE CROWN AND WAS ACTIVE IN THE BORDER RAIDS IN INDIA
6030-57826-0005 HIS SON LIVED TO COMPLETE THE TASK WHICH HE BEGAN OF HELPING TO OPEN INDIA TO THE CIVILIZED WORLD FOR HIS SERVICES ABRAHAM ROBERTS BECAME A GENERAL AND WAS KNIGHTED
6030-57826-0006 THE SON WHO WAS DESTINED TO WIN STILL HIGHER HONORS BEGAN HIS CAREER SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
6030-57826-0007 HE MUST HAVE BEEN A DISAPPOINTMENT TO HIS SOLDIER FATHER HE WAS PUNY AND SICKLY AND FOR A TIME IT DID NOT SEEM LIKELY THAT HE WOULD LIVE AT ALL SO WHEN HE WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS OLD HE WAS TAKEN FROM THE UNCONGENIAL AIR OF INDIA AND BROUGHT BY HIS PARENTS TO ENGLAND
6030-57826-0008 HERE HE SPENT HIS BOYHOOD AWAY FROM THE FATHER AND MOTHER WHO WERE FORCED BY OFFICIAL DUTIES TO RETURN TO THE EAST HIS HOME WAS A CHARMING COUNTRY HOUSE AT CLIFTON NEAR BRISTOL WHERE FOR THE FIRST YEARS HE HAD PRIVATE TUTORS
6030-57826-0009 ONE INTERESTING EXPERIENCE WAS IN A SMALL SCHOOL AT CARRICKMACROSS IN IRELAND THEN AT ELEVEN HE ATTENDED PUBLIC SCHOOL AT HAMPTON BUT ALMOST NOTHING IS SET DOWN IN DETAIL AS TO THESE EARLY YEARS WHICH WOULD SHOW THAT BESIDES BEING A WEAKLING
6030-57826-0010 HE WAS IN NO SENSE REMARKABLE HE WAS MERELY ANOTHER OF THOSE SMALL BACKWARD URCHINS THAT ONE MAY SEE AT ANY RECESS ON ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL PLAYGROUND
6030-57826-0011 IT WILL DO NO HARM ANYWAY AND MAY STRAIGHTEN HIS SHOULDERS A BIT HE DOUBTLESS SAID AND SO AT THIRTEEN YOUNG ROBERTS WAS ENTERED AT ETON THAT TRAINING GROUND OF SO MANY OF ENGLAND'S SOLDIERS HE MADE HIS FIRST MARK IN THIS FAMOUS SCHOOL BY WINNING A PRIZE IN MATHEMATICS
6030-57826-0012 THE OBSCURE LAD WAS BEGINNING TO ASSERT HIMSELF TO THE END OF HIS DAYS ROBERTS HELD A WARM REGARD FOR ETON ONCE WHEN AT THE END OF A GREAT CAMPAIGN HE WAS PRESENTED WITH A SWORD OF HONOR ON THIS BOYHOOD'S DRILL GROUND HE SAID TO A YOUNGER GENERATION THEN ASSEMBLED
6030-57826-0013 TO YOU BOYS WHO INTEND TO ENTER THE ARMY
6030-57826-0014 ENGLAND'S GREATEST GENERAL HIMSELF AN ETONIAN
6030-57826-0015 IN THUS EXPRESSING HIMSELF THE DUKE WELLINGTON MEANT THAT BODILY VIGOR POWER OF ENDURANCE COURAGE AND RAPIDITY OF DECISION ARE PRODUCED BY THE MANLY GAMES WHICH ARE FOSTERED HERE
6030-57826-0016 UNDOUBTEDLY THERE WAS A PERSONAL TOUCH TO THESE REMARKS AS ROBERTS RECALLED HOW HE HIMSELF HAD BEGUN TO GAIN THESE STERLING QUALITIES ON THE CRICKET FIELD AND GRIDIRON
6030-57826-0017 BUT REMAINED THERE ONLY TWO TERMS BY NATURE HE WAS A STUDIOUS CHAP DOING ESPECIALLY WELL IN GERMAN AND MATHEMATICS SO EASILY DID HE SOLVE PROBLEMS IN ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY THAT HIS MATES PROMPTLY NICKNAMED HIM DEDUCTIONS
6030-57826-0018 DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STAND INDIA NOW MY LAD HE ASKED WHY NOT SIR REPLIED THE BOY BRIEFLY THEN I THINK THAT THE EAST INDIA COMPANY'S SERVICE IS THE PLACE FOR YOU COLONEL ROBERTS HIMSELF HAD BEEN CONNECTED WITH THIS GREAT COMPANY
6030-57826-0019 WHICH WAS THE FORERUNNER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN INDIA AND HE WAS RIGHT IN THINKING THAT ITS SERVICE OFFERED MANY CHANCES OF ADVANCEMENT ACCORDINGLY THE BOY WAS ENTERED IN THE COMPANY'S OWN MILITARY SCHOOL AT ADDISCOMBE AND IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HAD BECOME A SECOND LIEUTENANT IN THE BENGAL ARTILLERY
6030-57826-0020 IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO IN HIS TWENTIETH YEAR HE RECEIVED HIS FIRST MARCHING ORDERS THEY WERE TO REPORT FOR DUTY HE SET SAIL BY WAY OF SUEZ BUT THERE WAS NO CANAL IN THOSE DAYS TO MAKE POSSIBLE AN ALL WATER JOURNEY INSTEAD AT ALEXANDRIA HE CHANGED TO A SMALL INLAND STEAMER
6030-57826-0021 GOING BY CANAL AND RIVER TO CAIRO THENCE A HOT DUSTY TREK ACROSS THE DESERT WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO REACH SUEZ ONCE IN CALCUTTA THE YOUNG SUBALTERN LOST NO TIME IN PROVING THAT HE WAS NOT A MOLLYCODDLE
6030-57826-0022 HE BEGAN BY RIDING EVERY HORSE IN THE BATTERY OR TROOP AS IT WAS CALLED IN THOSE DAYS THUS HE TELLS US I LEARNED TO UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF NERVE PATIENCE AND SKILL NECESSARY TO THE MAKING OF A GOOD HORSE ARTILLERY DRIVER
6030-57826-0023 WITH THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE THAT I WAS BROUGHT INTO CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE MEN ROBERTS WAS EARLY LEARNING THE SECRET OF MORE THAN ONE GREAT GENERAL'S SUCCESS TO KNOW HIS MEN IN LATER LIFE HE COULD CALL MANY A MAN BY NAME AND KNEW JUST WHAT EACH COULD DO
6030-57826-0024 WHILE THEY RESPONDED WITH A CLOSE AFFECTION AND THE NICKNAME BY WHICH HE WILL BE KNOWN TO HISTORY BOBS IT IS SAID THAT NAPOLEON EXPECTED HIS OFFICERS TO KNOW THE NAMES AND PERSONAL HISTORIES OF EVERY MAN IN THEIR COMMAND AS ANOTHER RESULT OF ROBERTS FELLOWSHIP WITH THE RANK AND FILE
6030-57826-0025 HE BECAME A CRACK SHOT AND EXPERT HORSEMAN DURING THE FIGHTING IN THE MUTINY OF INDIAN SEPOYS HE PROVED HIMSELF A GOOD SWORDSMAN AS WELL AND EVEN WHEN HE BECAME COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE WOULD RIDE WITH A TENT PEGGING TEAM OF HIS OWN STAFF
6030-57826-0026 IT WAS A LONG AND THOROUGH SERVICE THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO RECEIVE HE JOINED THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL'S OFFICE BEFORE THE MUTINY BROKE OUT AND REMAINED IN IT FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS DURING THIS PERIOD HE GRADUALLY WORKED HIS WAY UP FROM ONE POST OF RESPONSIBILITY TO ANOTHER
6030-57826-0027 DOING IT SO GRADUALLY THAT EVEN HE HIMSELF HARDLY NOTICED THE ADVANCE ON ONE OCCASION FOR EXAMPLE HE SUPERINTENDED ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR EMBARKING THE BENGAL DIVISION WHICH SAILED FROM CALCUTTA TO TAKE PART IN AN EXPEDITION AGAINST ABYSSINIA
6030-57826-0028 BUT HOW HE MUST HAVE CHAFED AT THE LONG DELAY IN GETTING INTO THE FIELD HE ASKED HIS FATHER MORE THAN ONCE TO GET HIM TRANSFERRED TO BURMA WHERE WAR HAD BROKEN OUT AND THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR ACTIVE SERVICE THE TRANSFER WAS NOT GRANTED
6030-57826-0029 IT WAS ACTUALLY WELCOMED ANYTHING FOR A CHANGE ROBERTS GIVES A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF IT IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY HE AND A NATIVE SERVANT WERE CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN WHEN THE STORM DESCENDED WITH LITTLE WARNING
6030-57826-0030 I SHOUTED TO HIM THE SERVANT AS LOUDLY AS I COULD HE RELATES BUT THE UPROAR WAS SO TERRIFIC THAT HE COULD NOT HEAR A WORD
6030-57826-0031 THE DARKNESS WAS PROFOUND AS I WAS WALKING CAREFULLY ALONG I SUDDENLY CAME IN CONTACT WITH AN OBJECT WHICH A TIMELY FLASH OF LIGHTNING SHOWED ME WAS A COLUMN STANDING IN EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM MY OWN HOUSE I COULD NOW LOCATE MYSELF CORRECTLY
6030-57826-0032 AND THE LIGHTNING BECOMING EVERY MOMENT MORE VIVID I WAS ENABLED TO GROPE MY WAY BY SLOW DEGREES TO THE MESS WHERE I EXPECTED TO FIND SOME ONE TO SHOW ME MY WAY HOME
6030-57826-0033 HAD ALREADY CLOSED THE OUTSIDE VENETIAN SHUTTERS AND BARRED ALL THE DOORS IN VAIN I BANGED AT THE DOOR AND CALLED AT THE TOP OF MY VOICE THEY HEARD NOTHING IN DESPERATION HE HAD TO MAKE HIS WAY AS BEST HE COULD BACK TO HIS OWN BUNGALOW
6030-57826-0034 ABOUT HALF A MILE AWAY ONLY TO FIND THAT ALSO BARRED AGAINST HIM I HAD TO CONTINUE HAMMERING FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY HEARD AND ADMITTED ME THANKFUL TO BE COMPARATIVELY SAFE INSIDE A HOUSE ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT TO ROBERTS LAY IN THE FACT THAT HE WAS STILL AWAY FROM HIS FATHER
6030-57826-0035 WHO SEEMED DESTINED ALL HIS LIFE TO REMAIN A STRANGER TO HIM THE JUNIOR OFFICER WAS STATIONED AT DUM DUM FAMOUS AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE SOFT NOSED BULLETS NOW PROSCRIBED IN CIVILIZED WARFARE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE TROOPS AT PESHAWAR
6030-57826-0036 AND NOW WROTE HIM A WELCOME NOTE BIDDING HIM COME TO JOIN HIM THIS WAS EASIER SAID THAN DONE BUT WAS FINALLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THREE MONTHS OF TOILSOME AND DANGEROUS TRAVEL HE USED EVERY SORT OF NATIVE CONVEYANCE BARGE POST CHAISE PALANQUIN PONY AND SHANK'S MARES
6030-57826-0037 HE WENT BY WAY OF BENARES
6030-57826-0038 CAWNPORE AND MEERUT PLACES DESTINED TO WIN UNPLEASANT FAME IN THE MUTINY PESHAWAR HIS DESTINATION PROVED NO LESS FASCINATING THAN THE WAY STATIONS IT COMMANDED THE CARAVAN ROUTE BETWEEN INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN
6030-57826-0039 AND GUARDED THE ENTRANCE TO KHYBER PASS
6030-57826-0040 A VERY ACCURATE TITLE AT PESHAWAR AT LAST FREDERICK ROBERTS BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH HIS FATHER WHO PROVED A GOOD COMRADE THE JUNIOR OFFICER SERVED AS AIDE DE CAMP ON THE GENERAL'S STAFF AND WENT WITH HIM ON SEVERAL EXPEDITIONS OUTWARDLY PEACEFUL BUT INWARDLY FULL OF DANGER
6030-57826-0041 INDIA THEN WAS A SEETHING CALDRON OF TROUBLE NEVERTHELESS THIS PERIOD WITH HIS FATHER IS DESCRIBED BY FREDERICK ROBERTS AS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST AND HAPPIEST OF MY EARLY LIFE UNFORTUNATELY THE SENIOR OFFICER'S HEALTH SHOWED SIGNS OF BREAKING AND AGAIN FATHER AND SON HAD TO PART
6030-57826-0042 PESHAWAR WAS A NOTORIOUSLY UNHEALTHY STATION AND YOUNG ROBERTS ALSO SOON BEGAN TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THE CLIMATE HE WAS STILL FAR FROM ROBUST AND TRADED CONTINUALLY ON HIS WILL AND NERVE THE NATIVE FEVER SAPPED HIS ENERGY AND HE WAS SENT TO RECUPERATE TO KASHMIR
6030-57826-0043 HE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE SCENERY HERE AND HIS TRAMPING AND SHOOTING TRIPS IN THE BRACING CLIMATE SOON GAVE BACK HIS STRENGTH AND VIM IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT HE REALIZED HIS PET AMBITION OF JOINING THE HORSE ARTILLERY HE ALSO SET HIMSELF WITH A WILL TO THE STUDY OF HINDUSTANI
6030-57826-0044 AS HE REALIZED THAT HIS USEFULNESS IN THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULD BE VASTLY INCREASED IF HE COULD DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THE NATIVES THIS WAS A TURNING POINT IN ROBERTS CAREER IT WAS TO BE HIS FIRST STEPPING STONE UPWARD AND IT ILLUSTRATES THE POINT THAT EVEN THOUGH OPPORTUNITY MAY KNOCK AT THE DOOR
6030-57826-0045 ONE MUST BE READY FOR HER THAT ROBERTS FINALLY WON HIS LARGER SUCCESS WAS DUE NOT SO MUCH TO HIS GENIUS AS TO HIS INDUSTRY
