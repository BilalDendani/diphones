3557-8341-0000 AT THE FIRST GREY DAWN OF THE DAY
3557-8341-0001 SLEEPLESS AND ALONE ON THE SUMMIT OF THE LOFTY AND PYRAMIDAL TOWER WHICH FLANKED HIS HOUSE A TALL PARAPET AROUND IT SERVED AS A WALL AND CONSPIRED
3557-8341-0002 TO DEFY THE PRYING EYES OF CURIOSITY OR OBSERVATION A TABLE ON WHICH LAY A SCROLL FILLED WITH MYSTIC FIGURES WAS BEFORE HIM ON HIGH THE STARS WAXED DIM AND FAINT
3557-8341-0003 AND THE SHADES OF NIGHT MELTED FROM THE STERILE MOUNTAIN TOPS
3557-8341-0004 THE STRUGGLE OF NIGHT AND DAY WAS MORE VISIBLE OVER THE BROAD OCEAN WHICH STRETCHED CALM LIKE A GIGANTIC LAKE BOUNDED BY THE CIRCLING SHORES THAT COVERED WITH VINES AND FOLIAGE AND GLEAMING HERE AND THERE WITH THE WHITE WALLS OF SLEEPING CITIES
3557-8341-0005 IT WAS THE HOUR ABOVE ALL OTHERS MOST SACRED TO THE DARING SCIENCE OF THE EGYPTIAN THE SCIENCE WHICH WOULD READ OUR CHANGEFUL DESTINIES IN THE STARS HE HAD FILLED HIS SCROLL
3557-8341-0006 AGAIN DO THE STARS FOREWARN ME SOME DANGER THEN ASSUREDLY AWAITS ME SAID HE SLOWLY SOME DANGER VIOLENT AND SUDDEN IN ITS NATURE
3557-8341-0007 THE STARS WEAR FOR ME THE SAME MOCKING MENACE WHICH IF OUR CHRONICLES DO NOT ERR
3557-8341-0008 FOR HIM DOOMED TO STRIVE FOR ALL THINGS TO ENJOY NONE ALL ATTACKING NOTHING GAINING BATTLES WITHOUT FRUIT LAURELS WITHOUT TRIUMPH FAME WITHOUT SUCCESS AT LAST MADE CRAVEN BY HIS OWN SUPERSTITIONS
3557-8341-0009 AND SLAIN LIKE A DOG BY A TILE FROM THE HAND OF AN OLD WOMAN VERILY THE STARS FLATTER WHEN THEY GIVE ME A TYPE IN THIS FOOL OF WAR WHEN THEY PROMISE TO THE ARDOUR OF MY WISDOM THE SAME RESULTS AS TO THE MADNESS OF HIS AMBITION
3557-8341-0010 LET ME LOOK AGAIN BEWARE SAY THE SHINING PROPHETS HOW THOU PASSEST UNDER ANCIENT ROOFS OR BESIEGED WALLS
3557-8341-0011 IS CHARGED BY THE CURSES OF DESTINY AGAINST THEE AND AT NO DISTANT DATE FROM THIS COMES THE PERIL BUT I CANNOT OF A CERTAINTY
3557-8341-0012 WELL IF MY GLASS RUNS LOW THE SANDS SHALL SPARKLE TO THE LAST YET IF I ESCAPE THIS PERIL
3557-8341-0013 I SEE HONORS HAPPINESS SUCCESS SHINING UPON EVERY BILLOW OF THE DARK GULF BENEATH WHICH I MUST SINK AT LAST WHAT THEN WITH SUCH DESTINIES BEYOND THE PERIL SHALL I SUCCUMB TO THE PERIL
3557-8341-0014 MY SOUL WHISPERS HOPE IT SWEEPS EXULTINGLY BEYOND THE BODING HOUR
3557-8341-0015 HE PACED RAPIDLY THE NARROW SPACE OF THAT STAR ROOFED FLOOR AND PAUSING AT THE PARAPET LOOKED AGAIN UPON THE GREY AND MELANCHOLY HEAVENS THE CHILLS OF THE FAINT DAWN CAME REFRESHINGLY UPON HIS BROW
3557-8341-0016 NO LIGHTS SAVE HERE AND THERE FROM BEFORE THE COLUMNS OF A TEMPLE
3557-8341-0017 THE STREAMS OF LIFE CIRCULATED NOT THEY LAY LOCKED UNDER THE ICE OF SLEEP
3557-8341-0018 WITH ITS STONY SEATS RISING ONE ABOVE THE OTHER COILED AND ROUND AS SOME SLUMBERING MONSTER ROSE A THIN AND GHASTLY MIST WHICH GATHERED DARKER AND MORE DARK OVER THE SCATTERED FOLIAGE THAT GLOOMED IN ITS VICINITY
3557-8341-0019 THE CITY SEEMED AS AFTER THE AWFUL CHANGE OF SEVENTEEN AGES IT SEEMS NOW TO THE TRAVELER A CITY OF THE DEAD THE OCEAN ITSELF THAT SERENE AND TIDELESS SEA
3557-8341-0020 STABIAE AND HERCULANEUM AND POMPEII THOSE CHILDREN AND DARLINGS OF THE DEEP YE SLUMBER SAID THE EGYPTIAN
3557-8341-0021 AS HE SCOWLED OVER THE CITIES THE BOAST AND FLOWER OF CAMPANIA YE SLUMBER
3557-8341-0022 AS YE NOW JEWELS IN THE CROWN OF EMPIRE SO ONCE WERE THE CITIES OF THE NILE THEIR GREATNESS HATH PERISHED FROM THEM THEY SLEEP AMIDST RUINS THEIR PALACES AND THEIR SHRINES ARE TOMBS
3557-8341-0023 THE SERPENT COILS IN THE GRASS OF THEIR STREETS THE LIZARD BASKS IN THEIR SOLITARY HALLS BY THAT MYSTERIOUS LAW OF NATURE WHICH HUMBLES ONE TO EXALT THE OTHER
3557-8341-0024 THOU HAUGHTY ROME
3557-8341-0025 THE TIME SHALL COME WHEN EGYPT SHALL BE AVENGED
3557-8341-0026 AS THE EGYPTIAN UTTERED A PREDICTION WHICH FATE SO FEARFULLY FULFILLED
3557-8341-0027 THE MORNING LIGHT WHICH CAN PALE SO WANLY EVEN THE YOUNG CHEEK OF BEAUTY GAVE HIS MAJESTIC AND STATELY FEATURES ALMOST THE COLORS OF THE GRAVE
3557-8341-0028 AND THE GLITTERING EYES FIERCE WITH A SAVAGE GLADNESS HALF PROPHET AND HALF FIEND
3557-8341-0029 BEFORE HIM LAY THE VINEYARDS AND MEADOWS OF THE RICH CAMPANIA THE GATE AND WALLS ANCIENT HALF PELASGIC OF THE CITY SEEMED NOT TO BOUND ITS EXTENT
3557-8341-0030 VILLAS AND VILLAGES STRETCHED ON EVERY SIDE UP THE ASCENT OF VESUVIUS NOT NEARLY THEN SO STEEP OR SO LOFTY AS AT PRESENT FOR AS ROME ITSELF IS BUILT ON AN EXHAUSTED VOLCANO
3557-8341-0031 SO IN SIMILAR SECURITY THE INHABITANTS OF THE SOUTH TENANTED THE GREEN AND VINE CLAD PLACES
3557-8341-0032 FROM THE GATE STRETCHED THE LONG STREET OF TOMBS VARIOUS IN SIZE AND ARCHITECTURE BY WHICH ON THAT SIDE THE CITY IS AS YET APPROACHED ABOVE ALL
3557-8341-0033 RODE THE CLOUD CAPPED SUMMIT OF THE DREAD MOUNTAIN WITH THE SHADOWS NOW DARK NOW LIGHT BETRAYING THE MOSSY CAVERNS AND ASHY ROCKS WHICH TESTIFIED THE PAST CONFLAGRATIONS AND MIGHT HAVE PROPHESIED
3557-8341-0034 BUT MAN IS BLIND THAT WHICH WAS TO COME DIFFICULT WAS IT THEN AND THERE TO GUESS THE CAUSES WHY THE TRADITION OF THE PLACE WORE SO GLOOMY AND STERN A HUE WHY IN THOSE SMILING PLAINS
3557-8341-0035 FOR MILES AROUND TO BAIAE AND MISENUM
3557-8341-0036 WHY IN THOSE PHLEGRAE NOW LAUGHING WITH THE VINE
3557-8341-0037 SAVE INDEED THAT YET IN YON SEARED AND BLASTED SUMMIT FANCY MIGHT THINK TO READ THE CHARACTERS OF THE OLYMPIAN THUNDERBOLT BUT IT WAS NEITHER THE RUGGED HEIGHT OF THE STILL VOLCANO
3557-8341-0038 NOR THE MELANCHOLY AVENUE OF TOMBS NOR THE GLITTERING VILLAS OF A POLISHED AND LUXURIOUS PEOPLE
3557-8341-0039 BROKEN HERE AND THERE BY JAGGED CRAGS AND COPSES OF WILD FOLIAGE AT THE BASE OF THIS LAY A MARSHY AND UNWHOLESOME POOL AND THE INTENT GAZE OF ARBACES CAUGHT THE OUTLINE OF SOME LIVING FORM MOVING BY THE MARSHES
3557-8341-0040 AND STOOPING EVER AND ANON AS IF TO PLUCK ITS RANK PRODUCE HO SAID HE ALOUD I HAVE THEN ANOTHER COMPANION IN THESE UNWORLDLY NIGHT WATCHES
3557-8341-0041 WHAT DOTH SHE TOO AS THE CREDULOUS IMAGINE DOTH SHE TOO LEARN THE LORE OF THE GREAT STARS HATH SHE BEEN UTTERING FOUL MAGIC TO THE MOON OR CULLING
3557-8341-0042 AS HER PAUSES BETOKEN FOUL HERBS FROM THE VENOMOUS MARSH WELL
