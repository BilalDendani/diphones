242-122626-0000 THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY WE HAD BEEN WANDERING INDEED IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING BUT SINCE DINNER MISSUS REED WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY DINED EARLY THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT
242-122626-0001 AND HUMBLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY PHYSICAL INFERIORITY TO ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA REED THE SAID ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA WERE NOW CLUSTERED ROUND THEIR MAMA IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE LAY RECLINED ON A SOFA BY THE FIRESIDE
242-122626-0002 AND COULD DISCOVER BY HER OWN OBSERVATION THAT I WAS ENDEAVOURING IN GOOD EARNEST TO ACQUIRE A MORE SOCIABLE AND CHILDLIKE DISPOSITION A MORE ATTRACTIVE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNER SOMETHING LIGHTER FRANKER MORE NATURAL AS IT WERE
242-122626-0003 WHAT DOES BESSIE SAY I HAVE DONE I ASKED JANE I DON'T LIKE CAVILLERS OR QUESTIONERS BESIDES THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY FORBIDDING IN A CHILD TAKING UP HER ELDERS IN THAT MANNER
242-122626-0004 BE SEATED SOMEWHERE AND UNTIL YOU CAN SPEAK PLEASANTLY REMAIN SILENT A BREAKFAST ROOM ADJOINED THE DRAWING ROOM I SLIPPED IN THERE IT CONTAINED A BOOKCASE I SOON POSSESSED MYSELF OF A VOLUME
242-122626-0005 I MOUNTED INTO THE WINDOW SEAT GATHERING UP MY FEET I SAT CROSS LEGGED LIKE A TURK AND HAVING DRAWN THE RED MOREEN CURTAIN NEARLY CLOSE I WAS SHRINED IN DOUBLE RETIREMENT
242-122626-0006 AT INTERVALS WHILE TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF MY BOOK I STUDIED THE ASPECT OF THAT WINTER AFTERNOON AFAR IT OFFERED A PALE BLANK OF MIST AND CLOUD NEAR A SCENE OF WET LAWN AND STORM BEAT SHRUB WITH CEASELESS RAIN
242-122626-0007 I RETURNED TO MY BOOK
242-122626-0008 NOR COULD I PASS UNNOTICED THE SUGGESTION OF THE BLEAK SHORES OF LAPLAND SIBERIA SPITZBERGEN NOVA ZEMBLA ICELAND GREENLAND WITH THE VAST SWEEP OF THE ARCTIC ZONE AND THOSE FORLORN REGIONS OF DREARY SPACE
242-122626-0009 THAT RESERVOIR OF FROST AND SNOW WHERE FIRM FIELDS OF ICE THE ACCUMULATION OF CENTURIES OF WINTERS
242-122626-0010 OF THESE DEATH WHITE REALMS I FORMED AN IDEA OF MY OWN
242-122626-0011 AND GAVE SIGNIFICANCE TO THE ROCK STANDING UP ALONE IN A SEA OF BILLOW AND SPRAY TO THE BROKEN BOAT STRANDED ON A DESOLATE COAST
242-122626-0012 THE TWO SHIPS BECALMED ON A TORPID SEA I BELIEVED TO BE MARINE PHANTOMS
242-122626-0013 EACH PICTURE TOLD A STORY MYSTERIOUS OFTEN TO MY UNDEVELOPED UNDERSTANDING AND IMPERFECT FEELINGS YET EVER PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING AS INTERESTING AS THE TALES BESSIE SOMETIMES NARRATED ON WINTER EVENINGS
242-122626-0014 WHEN SHE CHANCED TO BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AND WHEN HAVING BROUGHT HER IRONING TABLE TO THE NURSERY HEARTH SHE ALLOWED US TO SIT ABOUT IT AND WHILE SHE GOT UP MISSUS REED'S LACE FRILLS AND CRIMPED HER NIGHTCAP BORDERS
242-122626-0015 I FEARED NOTHING BUT INTERRUPTION AND THAT CAME TOO SOON
242-122626-0016 TELL MAMA SHE IS RUN OUT INTO THE RAIN BAD ANIMAL IT IS WELL I DREW THE CURTAIN THOUGHT I AND I WISHED FERVENTLY HE MIGHT NOT DISCOVER MY HIDING PLACE NOR WOULD JOHN REED HAVE FOUND IT OUT HIMSELF HE WAS NOT QUICK
242-122626-0017 EITHER OF VISION OR CONCEPTION BUT ELIZA JUST PUT HER HEAD IN AT THE DOOR AND SAID AT ONCE
242-122626-0018 BUT THE MOTHER'S HEART TURNED FROM AN OPINION SO HARSH
242-122626-0019 AND PERHAPS TO PINING AFTER HOME JOHN HAD NOT MUCH AFFECTION FOR HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AN ANTIPATHY TO ME HE BULLIED AND PUNISHED ME NOT TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE WEEK
242-122626-0020 BUT CONTINUALLY EVERY NERVE I HAD FEARED HIM AND EVERY MORSEL OF FLESH IN MY BONES SHRANK WHEN HE CAME NEAR THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I WAS BEWILDERED BY THE TERROR HE INSPIRED
242-122626-0021 SHE NEVER SAW HIM STRIKE OR HEARD HIM ABUSE ME THOUGH HE DID BOTH NOW AND THEN IN HER VERY PRESENCE MORE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER BEHIND HER BACK
242-122626-0022 OF HIM WHO WOULD PRESENTLY DEAL IT
242-122626-0023 HE STRUCK SUDDENLY AND STRONGLY I TOTTERED AND ON REGAINING MY EQUILIBRIUM RETIRED BACK A STEP OR TWO FROM HIS CHAIR
242-122626-0024 AND FOR THE LOOK YOU HAD IN YOUR EYES TWO MINUTES SINCE YOU RAT
242-122626-0025 MY CARE WAS HOW TO ENDURE THE BLOW WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW THE INSULT WHAT WERE YOU DOING BEHIND THE CURTAIN HE ASKED I WAS READING SHOW THE BOOK I RETURNED TO THE WINDOW AND FETCHED IT THENCE
242-122626-0026 YOU ARE A DEPENDENT MAMA SAYS YOU HAVE NO MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU NONE YOU OUGHT TO BEG AND NOT TO LIVE HERE WITH GENTLEMEN'S CHILDREN LIKE US AND EAT THE SAME MEALS WE DO
242-122626-0027 NOW I'LL TEACH YOU TO RUMMAGE MY BOOKSHELVES FOR THEY ARE MINE ALL THE HOUSE BELONGS TO ME OR WILL DO IN A FEW YEARS
242-122626-0028 NOT SOON ENOUGH HOWEVER THE VOLUME WAS FLUNG IT HIT ME AND I FELL STRIKING MY HEAD AGAINST THE DOOR AND CUTTING IT THE CUT BLED THE PAIN WAS SHARP MY TERROR HAD PASSED ITS CLIMAX OTHER FEELINGS SUCCEEDED
242-122626-0029 ALSO I HAD DRAWN PARALLELS IN SILENCE WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT THUS TO HAVE DECLARED ALOUD
242-122626-0030 DID SHE SAY THAT TO ME DID YOU HEAR HER ELIZA AND GEORGIANA WON'T I TELL MAMA BUT FIRST HE RAN HEADLONG AT ME I FELT HIM GRASP MY HAIR AND MY SHOULDER HE HAD CLOSED WITH A DESPERATE THING
242-122626-0031 I REALLY SAW IN HIM A TYRANT A MURDERER I FELT A DROP OR TWO OF BLOOD FROM MY HEAD TRICKLE DOWN MY NECK AND WAS SENSIBLE OF SOMEWHAT PUNGENT SUFFERING THESE SENSATIONS FOR THE TIME PREDOMINATED OVER FEAR AND I RECEIVED HIM IN FRANTIC SORT
242-122626-0032 SHE NOW CAME UPON THE SCENE FOLLOWED BY BESSIE AND HER MAID ABBOT
