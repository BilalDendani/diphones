3105-166683-0000 WHY THE HAND MAY BE DIPPED IN MOLTEN METALS
3105-166683-0001 EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IF IT IS NOT TOO HOT THE WATER WILL SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE AND EVAPORATE BUT IF IT IS TOO HOT THE WATER WILL GLANCE OFF WITHOUT WETTING THE IRON AND IF THIS DROP BE ALLOWED TO FALL ON THE HAND IT WILL BE FOUND THAT IT IS STILL COOL
3105-166683-0002 THE FACT IS THAT THE WATER NEVER TOUCHES THE HOT IRON AT ALL PROVIDED THE HEAT IS SUFFICIENTLY INTENSE BUT ASSUMES A SLIGHTLY ELLIPTICAL SHAPE AND IS SUPPORTED BY A CUSHION OF VAPOR
3105-166683-0003 IF INSTEAD OF A FLAT IRON WE USE A CONCAVE METAL DISK ABOUT THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF A WATCH CRYSTAL SOME VERY INTERESTING RESULTS MAY BE OBTAINED IF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE DISK IS AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE BOILING POINT
3105-166683-0004 WATER DROPPED ON IT FROM A MEDICINE DROPPER WILL BOIL
3105-166683-0005 SINCE THE VAPOR IS SO RAPIDLY EVAPORATED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE DROP THAT IT FORMS THE CUSHION JUST MENTIONED BY A CAREFUL MANIPULATION OF THE DROPPER THE DISK MAY BE FILLED WITH WATER WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING THE INTENSE HEAT NEVER REACHES THE BOILING POINT
3105-166683-0006 WHEN IN THAT STATE OR NINETEEN DEGREES BELOW THE FREEZING POINT OF WATER SO THAT IF A LITTLE WATER BE DROPPED INTO THE ACID IT WILL IMMEDIATELY FREEZE AND THE PELLET OF ICE MAY BE DROPPED INTO THE HAND FROM THE STILL RED HOT DISK
3105-166683-0007 EVEN MERCURY CAN BE FROZEN IN THIS WAY BY A COMBINATION OF CHEMICALS THROUGH THE ACTION OF THIS PRINCIPLE IT IS POSSIBLE TO DIP THE HAND FOR A SHORT TIME INTO MELTED LEAD
3105-166683-0008 OR EVEN INTO MELTED COPPER THE MOISTURE OF THE SKIN SUPPLYING A VAPOR WHICH PREVENTS DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE MOLTEN METAL NO MORE THAN AN ENDURABLE DEGREE OF HEAT REACHES THE HAND WHILE THE MOISTURE LASTS
3105-166683-0009 THE NATURAL MOISTURE OF THE HAND IS USUALLY SUFFICIENT FOR THIS RESULT BUT IT IS BETTER TO WIPE THE HAND WITH A DAMP TOWEL IN DAVID A WELLS THINGS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN NEW YORK EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN
3105-166683-0010 HE ADDS THAT WHEN THE HAND WAS DAMPENED WITH ETHER THERE WAS NO SENSATION OF HEAT BUT ON THE CONTRARY AN AGREEABLE FEELING OF COOLNESS BECKMANN IN HIS HISTORY OF INVENTIONS VOL TWO
3105-166683-0011 HE THEN SQUEEZED THE FINGERS OF HIS HORNY HAND CLOSE TOGETHER PUT IT FOR A FEW MINUTES UNDER HIS ARMPIT TO MAKE IT SWEAT AS HE SAID AND TAKING IT AGAIN OUT DREW IT OVER A LADLE FILLED WITH MELTED COPPER SOME OF WHICH HE SKIMMED OFF
3105-166683-0012 AND MOVED HIS HAND BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS VERY QUICKLY BY WAY OF OSTENTATION WHILE I WAS VIEWING THIS PERFORMANCE I REMARKED A SMELL LIKE THAT OF SINGED HORN OR LEATHER THOUGH HIS HAND WAS NOT BURNT
3105-166683-0013 THE WORKMEN AT THE SWEDISH MELTING HOUSE SHOWED THE SAME THING TO SOME TRAVELLERS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FOR REGNARD SAW IT IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY ONE AT THE COPPER WORKS IN LAPLAND
3105-166683-0014 SAW THE SAME STUNT PERFORMED BY WORKMEN AT THE MERIDAN BRITTANIA COMPANY'S PLANT THEY TOLD HIM THAT IF THE HAND HAD BEEN WET IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BADLY SCALDED
3105-166683-0015 THUS FAR OUR INTEREST IN HEAT RESISTANCE HAS UNCOVERED SECRETS OF NO VERY GREAT PRACTICAL VALUE HOWEVER ENTERTAINING THE USES TO WHICH WE HAVE SEEN THEM PUT BUT NOT ALL THE INVESTIGATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES HAS BEEN DICTATED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF CURIOSITY AND ENTERTAINMENT
3105-166683-0016 AS LONG AGO AS EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE FOR INSTANCE AN ENGLISH NEWSPAPER PRINTED THE FOLLOWING PROOF AGAINST FIRE ON TUESDAY WEEK AN EXPERIMENT WAS MADE IN PRESENCE OF A COMMITTEE OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT PARIS
3105-166683-0017 SO AS TO ENABLE FIREMEN TO CARRY ON THEIR OPERATIONS WITH SAFETY HIS EXPERIMENT IS STATED TO HAVE GIVEN SATISFACTION THE POMPIERS WERE CLOTHED IN ASBESTOS OVER WHICH WAS A NETWORK OF IRON
3105-166683-0018 SOME OF THEM IT WAS STATED WHO WORE DOUBLE GLOVES OF AMIANTHUS HELD A RED HOT BAR DURING FOUR MINUTES
3105-166683-0019 GIVES A MORE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF ALDINI FROM WHICH THE NATURAL DEDUCTION IS THAT THE CHEVALIER WAS A SHOWMAN WITH AN INTELLECT FULLY UP TO THE DEMANDS OF HIS ART SIR DAVID SAYS
3105-166683-0020 HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE NOBLER PURPOSE OF SAVING HUMAN LIFE AND RESCUING PROPERTY FROM THE FLAMES
3105-166683-0021 WHO HAS TRAVELLED THROUGH ALL EUROPE TO PRESENT THIS VALUABLE GIFT TO HIS SPECIES SIR H DAVY HAD LONG AGO SHOWN THAT A SAFETY LAMP FOR ILLUMINATING MINES CONTAINING INFLAMMABLE AIR MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED OF WIRE GAUZE ALONE
3105-166683-0022 WHICH PREVENTED THE FLAME WITHIN HOWEVER LARGE OR INTENSE FROM SETTING FIRE TO THE INFLAMMABLE AIR WITHOUT THIS VALUABLE PROPERTY WHICH HAS BEEN LONG IN PRACTICAL USE HE ASCRIBED TO THE CONDUCTING AND RADIATING POWER OF THE WIRE GAUZE WHICH CARRIED OFF THE HEAT OF THE FLAME
3105-166683-0023 THE INCOMBUSTIBLE PIECES OF DRESS WHICH HE USES FOR THE BODY ARMS AND LEGS ARE FORMED OUT OF STRONG CLOTH WHICH HAS BEEN STEEPED IN A SOLUTION OF ALUM WHILE THOSE FOR THE HEAD HANDS AND FEET ARE MADE OF CLOTH OF ASBESTOS OR AMIANTHUS
3105-166683-0024 THE HEAD DRESS IS A LARGE CAP WHICH ENVELOPS THE WHOLE HEAD DOWN TO THE NECK HAVING SUITABLE PERFORATIONS FOR THE EYES NOSE AND MOUTH THE STOCKINGS AND CAP ARE SINGLE BUT THE GLOVES ARE MADE OF DOUBLE AMIANTHUS CLOTH
3105-166683-0025 AND FIVE FEET THREE INCHES WIDE WHICH IS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE ANCIENT PIECE AND POSSESSES SUPERIOR QUALITIES IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING BEEN WOVEN WITHOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF ANY FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IN THIS MANUFACTURE THE FIBERS ARE PREVENTED FROM BREAKING BY ACTION OF STEAM
3105-166683-0026 THE METALLIC DRESS WHICH IS SUPERADDED TO THESE MEANS OF DEFENCE CONSISTS OF FIVE PRINCIPAL PIECES
3105-166683-0027 WITH A MASK LARGE ENOUGH TO LEAVE A PROPER SPACE BETWEEN IT AND THE ASBESTOS CAP A CUIRASS WITH ITS BRASSETS A PIECE OF ARMOUR FOR THE TRUNK AND THIGHS A PAIR OF BOOTS OF DOUBLE WIRE GAUZE
3105-166683-0028 BEFORE THE HEAT BECAME INCONVENIENT A FIREMAN HAVING HIS HAND WITHIN A DOUBLE ASBESTOS GLOVE AND ITS PALM PROTECTED BY A PIECE OF ASBESTOS CLOTH SEIZED WITH IMPUNITY A LARGE PIECE OF RED HOT IRON
3105-166683-0029 INFLAMED STRAW WITH IT AND BROUGHT IT BACK AGAIN TO THE FURNACE ON OTHER OCCASIONS THE FIREMAN HANDLED BLAZING WOOD AND BURNING SUBSTANCES AND WALKED DURING FIVE MINUTES UPON AN IRON GRATING PLACED OVER FLAMING FAGOTS
3105-166683-0030 IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW THE HEAD EYES AND LUNGS ARE PROTECTED THE FIREMAN PUT ON THE ASBESTOS AND WIRE GAUZE CAP AND THE CUIRASS AND HELD THE SHIELD BEFORE HIS BREAST
3105-166683-0031 A FIRE OF SHAVINGS WAS THEN LIGHTED AND KEPT BURNING IN A LARGE RAISED CHAFING DISH THE FIREMAN PLUNGED HIS HEAD INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLAMES WITH HIS FACE TO THE FUEL AND IN THAT POSITION WENT SEVERAL TIMES ROUND THE CHAFING DISH FOR A PERIOD LONGER THAN A MINUTE
3105-166683-0032 IN A SUBSEQUENT TRIAL AT PARIS A FIREMAN PLACED HIS HEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE BRAZIER FILLED WITH FLAMING HAY AND WOOD AND RESISTED THE ACTION OF THE FIRE DURING FIVE OR SIX MINUTES AND EVEN TEN MINUTES
3105-166683-0033 IN THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH WERE MADE AT PARIS IN THE PRESENCE OF A COMMITTEE OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES TWO PARALLEL ROWS OF STRAW AND BRUSHWOOD SUPPORTED BY IRON WIRES WERE FORMED AT THE DISTANCE OF THREE FEET FROM EACH OTHER AND EXTENDED THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
3105-166683-0034 WHEN THIS COMBUSTIBLE MASS WAS SET ON FIRE
3105-166683-0035 AT THIS MOMENT SIX FIREMEN CLOTHED IN THE INCOMBUSTIBLE DRESSES AND MARCHING AT A SLOW PACE BEHIND EACH OTHER REPEATEDLY PASSED THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH BETWEEN THE TWO ROWS OF FLAME WHICH WERE CONSTANTLY FED WITH ADDITIONAL COMBUSTIBLES
3105-166683-0036 ONE OF THE FIREMEN CARRIED ON HIS BACK A CHILD EIGHT YEARS OLD IN A WICKER BASKET COVERED WITH METALLIC GAUZE AND THE CHILD HAD NO OTHER DRESS THAN A CAP MADE OF AMIANTHINE CLOTH IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE
3105-166683-0037 ONE OF THEM WITH THE BASKET AND CHILD RUSHED INTO A NARROW PLACE WHERE THE FLAMES WERE RAGING EIGHT YARDS HIGH THE VIOLENCE OF THE FIRE WAS SO GREAT THAT HE COULD NOT BE SEEN WHILE A THICK BLACK SMOKE SPREAD AROUND
3105-166683-0038 THROWING OUT A HEAT WHICH WAS UNSUPPORTABLE BY SPECTATORS THE FIREMAN REMAINED SO LONG INVISIBLE THAT SERIOUS DOUBTS WERE ENTERTAINED OF HIS SAFETY HE AT LENGTH HOWEVER ISSUED FROM THE FIERY GULF UNINJURED
3105-166683-0039 AND PROUD OF HAVING SUCCEEDED IN BRAVING SO GREAT A DANGER IT IS A REMARKABLE RESULT OF THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT THE FIREMEN ARE ABLE TO BREATHE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLAMES
3105-166683-0040 IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH ITS TEMPERATURE BECOMES SUPPORTABLE BUT ALSO TO THE SINGULAR POWER WHICH THE BODY POSSESSES OF RESISTING GREAT HEATS AND OF BREATHING AIR OF HIGH TEMPERATURES
3105-166683-0041 AND REMAINED TEN MINUTES BUT AS THE THERMOMETER SUNK VERY RAPIDLY THEY RESOLVED TO ENTER THE ROOM SINGLY
3105-166683-0042 AND SIR JOSEPH ENTERED WHEN THE HEAT WAS TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN DEGREES THOUGH EXPOSED TO SUCH AN ELEVATED TEMPERATURE THEIR BODIES PRESERVED THEIR NATURAL DEGREE OF HEAT WHENEVER THEY BREATHED UPON A THERMOMETER IT SUNK SEVERAL DEGREES
3105-166683-0043 EVERY EXPIRATION PARTICULARLY IF STRONGLY MADE GAVE A PLEASANT IMPRESSION OF COOLNESS TO THEIR NOSTRILS AND THEIR COLD BREATH COOLED THEIR FINGERS WHENEVER IT REACHED THEM ON TOUCHING HIS SIDE SIR CHARLES BLAGDEN FOUND IT COLD LIKE A CORPSE
3105-166683-0044 HENCE THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE HUMAN BODY POSSESSES THE POWER OF DESTROYING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HEAT WHEN COMMUNICATED WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF QUICKNESS THIS POWER HOWEVER VARIES GREATLY IN DIFFERENT MEDIA
3105-166683-0045 THE SAME PERSON WHO EXPERIENCED NO INCONVENIENCE FROM AIR HEATED TO TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN DEGREES COULD JUST BEAR RECTIFIED SPIRITS OF WINE AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES
3105-166683-0046 COOLING WATER AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE DEGREES
3105-166683-0047 A FAMILIAR INSTANCE OF THIS OCCURRED IN THE HEATED ROOM ALL THE PIECES OF METAL THERE EVEN THEIR WATCH CHAINS FELT SO HOT THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY BEAR TO TOUCH THEM FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE AIR FROM WHICH THE METAL HAD DERIVED ALL ITS HEAT WAS ONLY UNPLEASANT
3105-166683-0048 THE SAME GENTLEMAN WHO PERFORMED THE EXPERIMENTS ABOVE DESCRIBED VENTURED TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO STILL HIGHER TEMPERATURES SIR CHARLES BLAGDEN WENT INTO A ROOM WHERE THE HEAT WAS ONE DEGREE OR TWO DEGREES ABOVE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES
3105-166683-0049 AND REMAINED EIGHT MINUTES IN THIS SITUATION FREQUENTLY WALKING ABOUT TO ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM BUT STANDING STILL MOST OF THE TIME IN THE COOLEST SPOT
3105-166683-0050 THE AIR THOUGH VERY HOT GAVE NO PAIN AND SIR CHARLES AND ALL THE OTHER GENTLEMEN WERE OF OPINION THAT THEY COULD SUPPORT A MUCH GREATER HEAT
3105-166683-0051 BUT AFTER THAT TIME HE FELT AN OPPRESSION IN HIS LUNGS WITH A SENSE OF ANXIETY WHICH INDUCED HIM TO LEAVE THE ROOM HIS PULSE WAS THEN ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR DOUBLE ITS ORDINARY QUICKNESS
3105-166683-0052 IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS NO MISTAKE RESPECTING THE DEGREE OF HEAT INDICATED BY THE THERMOMETER AND THAT THE AIR WHICH THEY BREATHED WAS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING ALL THE WELL KNOWN EFFECTS OF SUCH A HEAT ON INANIMATE MATTER
3105-166683-0053 THEY PLACED SOME EGGS AND A BEEF STEAK UPON A TIN FRAME NEAR THE THERMOMETER BUT MORE DISTANT FROM THE FURNACE THAN FROM THE WALL OF THE ROOM
3105-166683-0054 AND AS THEY HAD NOTICED THAT THE EFFECT OF THE HOT AIR WAS GREATLY INCREASED BY PUTTING IT IN MOTION THEY BLEW UPON THE STEAK WITH A PAIR OF BELLOWS AND THUS HASTENED THE DRESSING OF IT TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE GREATEST PORTION OF IT WAS FOUND TO BE PRETTY WELL DONE IN THIRTEEN MINUTES
3105-166683-0055 OUR DISTINGUISHED COUNTRYMAN SIR F CHANTREY HAS VERY RECENTLY EXPOSED HIMSELF TO A TEMPERATURE STILL HIGHER THAN ANY WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED THE FURNACE WHICH HE EMPLOYS FOR DRYING HIS MOULDS IS ABOUT FOURTEEN FEET LONG TWELVE FEET HIGH AND TWELVE FEET BROAD
3105-166683-0056 WHEN IT IS RAISED TO ITS HIGHEST TEMPERATURE WITH THE DOORS CLOSED THE THERMOMETER STANDS AT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DEGREES AND THE IRON FLOOR IS RED HOT THE WORKMEN OFTEN ENTER IT AT A TEMPERATURE OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY DEGREES WALKING OVER THE IRON FLOOR WITH WOODEN CLOGS
3105-166683-0057 WHICH ARE OF COURSE CHARRED ON THE SURFACE ON ONE OCCASION SIR F CHANTREY ACCOMPANIED BY FIVE OR SIX OF HIS FRIENDS ENTERED THE FURNACE AND AFTER REMAINING TWO MINUTES THEY BROUGHT OUT A THERMOMETER WHICH STOOD AT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES
