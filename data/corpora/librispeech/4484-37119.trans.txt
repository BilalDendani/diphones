4484-37119-0000 THE DEACON GOT UP DRESSED TOOK HIS THICK GNARLED STICK AND SLIPPED QUIETLY OUT OF THE HOUSE IT WAS DARK AND FOR THE FIRST MINUTE WHEN HE WENT INTO THE STREET
4484-37119-0001 HE COULD NOT EVEN SEE HIS WHITE STICK THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE STAR IN THE SKY AND IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THERE WOULD BE RAIN AGAIN THERE WAS A SMELL OF WET SAND AND SEA IT'S TO BE HOPED THAT THE MOUNTAINEERS WON'T ATTACK US
4484-37119-0002 THOUGHT THE DEACON HEARING THE TAP OF THE STICK ON THE PAVEMENT AND NOTICING HOW LOUD AND LONELY THE TAPS SOUNDED IN THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT WHEN HE GOT OUT OF TOWN HE BEGAN TO SEE BOTH THE ROAD AND HIS STICK
4484-37119-0003 HERE AND THERE IN THE BLACK SKY THERE WERE DARK CLOUDY PATCHES AND SOON A STAR PEEPED OUT AND TIMIDLY BLINKED ITS ONE EYE THE DEACON WALKED ALONG THE HIGH ROCKY COAST
4484-37119-0004 AND DID NOT SEE THE SEA IT WAS SLUMBERING BELOW AND ITS UNSEEN WAVES BROKE LANGUIDLY AND HEAVILY ON THE SHORE AS THOUGH SIGHING OUF AND HOW SLOWLY
4484-37119-0005 ONE WAVE BROKE THE DEACON HAD TIME TO COUNT EIGHT STEPS THEN ANOTHER BROKE AND SIX STEPS LATER A THIRD AS BEFORE NOTHING COULD BE SEEN
4484-37119-0006 AND IN THE DARKNESS ONE COULD HEAR THE LANGUID DROWSY DRONE OF THE SEA ONE COULD HEAR THE INFINITELY FARAWAY INCONCEIVABLE TIME WHEN GOD MOVED ABOVE CHAOS
4484-37119-0007 THE DEACON FELT UNCANNY HE HOPED GOD WOULD NOT PUNISH HIM FOR KEEPING COMPANY WITH INFIDELS AND EVEN GOING TO LOOK AT THEIR DUELS THE DUEL WOULD BE NONSENSICAL
4484-37119-0008 BLOODLESS ABSURD BUT HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE IT WAS A HEATHEN SPECTACLE AND IT WAS ALTOGETHER UNSEEMLY FOR AN ECCLESIASTICAL PERSON TO BE PRESENT AT IT HE STOPPED AND WONDERED
4484-37119-0009 SHOULD HE GO BACK BUT AN INTENSE RESTLESS CURIOSITY TRIUMPHED OVER HIS DOUBTS AND HE WENT ON THOUGH THEY ARE INFIDELS THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND WILL BE SAVED HE ASSURED HIMSELF
4484-37119-0010 THEY ARE SURE TO BE SAVED HE SAID ALOUD LIGHTING A CIGARETTE BY WHAT STANDARD MUST ONE MEASURE MEN'S QUALITIES TO JUDGE RIGHTLY OF THEM
4484-37119-0011 WHO BELIEVED IN GOD LIVED IN CHASTITY AND DID NOT FIGHT DUELS BUT HE USED TO FEED THE DEACON ON BREAD WITH SAND IN IT AND ON ONE OCCASION ALMOST PULLED OFF THE DEACON'S EAR
4484-37119-0012 IF HUMAN LIFE WAS SO ARTLESSLY CONSTRUCTED THAT EVERY ONE RESPECTED THIS CRUEL AND DISHONEST INSPECTOR WHO STOLE THE GOVERNMENT FLOUR AND HIS HEALTH AND SALVATION WERE PRAYED FOR IN THE SCHOOLS
4484-37119-0013 WAS IT JUST TO SHUN SUCH MEN AS VON KOREN AND LAEVSKY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE UNBELIEVERS THE DEACON WAS WEIGHING THIS QUESTION BUT HE RECALLED HOW ABSURD SAMOYLENKO HAD LOOKED YESTERDAY
4484-37119-0014 AND THAT BROKE THE THREAD OF HIS IDEAS WHAT FUN THEY WOULD HAVE NEXT DAY THE DEACON IMAGINED HOW HE WOULD SIT UNDER A BUSH AND LOOK ON AND WHEN VON KOREN BEGAN BOASTING NEXT DAY AT DINNER
4484-37119-0015 HE THE DEACON WOULD BEGIN LAUGHING AND TELLING HIM ALL THE DETAILS OF THE DUEL HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THE ZOOLOGIST WOULD ASK WELL THERE YOU ARE
4484-37119-0016 I STAYED AT HOME BUT I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT IT WOULD BE NICE TO WRITE A COMIC DESCRIPTION OF THE DUEL HIS FATHER IN LAW WOULD READ IT AND LAUGH A GOOD STORY TOLD OR WRITTEN
4484-37119-0017 WAS MORE THAN MEAT AND DRINK TO HIS FATHER IN LAW THE VALLEY OF THE YELLOW RIVER OPENED BEFORE HIM THE STREAM WAS BROADER AND FIERCER FOR THE RAIN AND INSTEAD OF MURMURING AS BEFORE IT WAS RAGING
4484-37119-0018 IT BEGAN TO GET LIGHT THE GREY DINGY MORNING AND THE CLOUDS RACING TOWARDS THE WEST TO OVERTAKE THE STORM CLOUDS THE MOUNTAINS GIRT WITH MIST AND THE WET TREES
4484-37119-0019 ALL STRUCK THE DEACON AS UGLY AND SINISTER HE WASHED AT THE BROOK REPEATED HIS MORNING PRAYER AND FELT A LONGING FOR TEA AND HOT ROLLS WITH SOUR CREAM
4484-37119-0020 WHICH WERE SERVED EVERY MORNING AT HIS FATHER IN LAW'S HE REMEMBERED HIS WIFE AND THE DAYS PAST RECALL WHICH SHE PLAYED ON THE PIANO WHAT SORT OF WOMAN WAS SHE
4484-37119-0021 HIS WIFE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED BETROTHED AND MARRIED TO HIM ALL IN ONE WEEK HE HAD LIVED WITH HER LESS THAN A MONTH WHEN HE WAS ORDERED HERE SO THAT HE HAD NOT HAD TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE WAS LIKE
4484-37119-0022 ALL THE SAME HE RATHER MISSED HER I MUST WRITE HER A NICE LETTER HE THOUGHT THE FLAG ON THE DUHAN HUNG LIMP SOAKED BY THE RAIN AND THE DUHAN ITSELF
4484-37119-0023 WITH ITS WET ROOF SEEMED DARKER AND LOWER THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE NEAR THE DOOR WAS STANDING A CART KERBALAY WITH TWO MOUNTAINEERS AND A YOUNG TATAR WOMAN IN TROUSERS
4484-37119-0024 NO DOUBT KERBALAY'S WIFE OR DAUGHTER WERE BRINGING SACKS OF SOMETHING OUT OF THE DUHAN AND PUTTING THEM ON MAIZE STRAW IN THE CART NEAR THE CART STOOD A PAIR OF ASSES HANGING THEIR HEADS
4484-37119-0025 BEGAN COVERING THEM OVER WITH STRAW WHILE KERBALAY BEGAN HURRIEDLY HARNESSING THE ASSES SMUGGLING PERHAPS THOUGHT THE DEACON HERE WAS THE FALLEN TREE WITH THE DRIED PINE NEEDLES
4484-37119-0026 HERE WAS THE BLACKENED PATCH FROM THE FIRE HE REMEMBERED THE PICNIC AND ALL ITS INCIDENTS THE FIRE THE SINGING OF THE MOUNTAINEERS HIS SWEET DREAMS OF BECOMING A BISHOP AND OF THE CHURCH PROCESSION
4484-37119-0027 THE BLACK RIVER HAD GROWN BLACKER AND BROADER WITH THE RAIN THE DEACON WALKED CAUTIOUSLY OVER THE NARROW BRIDGE WHICH BY NOW WAS REACHED BY THE TOPMOST CRESTS OF THE DIRTY WATER
4484-37119-0028 AND WENT UP THROUGH THE LITTLE COPSE TO THE DRYING SHED A SPLENDID HEAD HE THOUGHT STRETCHING HIMSELF ON THE STRAW AND THINKING OF VON KOREN A FINE HEAD GOD GRANT HIM HEALTH
4484-37119-0029 ONLY THERE IS CRUELTY IN HIM WHY DID HE HATE LAEVSKY AND LAEVSKY HATE HIM WHY WERE THEY GOING TO FIGHT A DUEL
4484-37119-0030 IF FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY HAD KNOWN POVERTY AS THE DEACON HAD IF THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AMONG IGNORANT HARD HEARTED GRASPING COARSE AND ILL MANNERED PEOPLE
4484-37119-0031 WHO GRUDGED YOU A CRUST OF BREAD WHO SPAT ON THE FLOOR AND HICCOUGHED AT DINNER AND AT PRAYERS IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN SPOILT FROM CHILDHOOD BY THE PLEASANT SURROUNDINGS AND THE SELECT CIRCLE OF FRIENDS THEY LIVED IN
4484-37119-0032 HOW THEY WOULD HAVE RUSHED AT EACH OTHER HOW READILY THEY WOULD HAVE OVERLOOKED EACH OTHER'S SHORTCOMINGS AND WOULD HAVE PRIZED EACH OTHER'S STRONG POINTS
4484-37119-0033 IT WAS TRUE THAT LAEVSKY WAS FLIGHTY DISSIPATED QUEER BUT HE DID NOT STEAL DID NOT SPIT LOUDLY ON THE FLOOR HE DID NOT ABUSE HIS WIFE AND SAY
4484-37119-0034 HE WOULD NOT BEAT A CHILD WITH REINS OR GIVE HIS SERVANTS STINKING MEAT TO EAT SURELY THIS WAS REASON ENOUGH TO BE INDULGENT TO HIM BESIDES HE WAS THE CHIEF SUFFERER FROM HIS FAILINGS
4484-37119-0035 LIKE A SICK MAN FROM HIS SORES INSTEAD OF BEING LED BY BOREDOM AND SOME SORT OF MISUNDERSTANDING TO LOOK FOR DEGENERACY EXTINCTION HEREDITY AND OTHER SUCH INCOMPREHENSIBLE THINGS IN EACH OTHER
4484-37119-0036 WOULD THEY NOT DO BETTER TO STOOP A LITTLE LOWER AND TURN THEIR HATRED AND ANGER WHERE WHOLE STREETS RESOUNDED WITH MOANINGS FROM COARSE IGNORANCE GREED SCOLDING IMPURITY SWEARING
4484-37119-0037 THE SHRIEKS OF WOMEN THE SOUND OF A CARRIAGE INTERRUPTED THE DEACON'S THOUGHTS HE GLANCED OUT OF THE DOOR AND SAW A CARRIAGE AND IN IT THREE PERSONS LAEVSKY SHESHKOVSKY
4484-37119-0038 AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE POST OFFICE STOP SAID SHESHKOVSKY ALL THREE GOT OUT OF THE CARRIAGE AND LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER THEY ARE NOT HERE YET SAID SHESHKOVSKY SHAKING THE MUD OFF WELL
4484-37119-0039 THERE'S NOT ROOM TO TURN ROUND HERE THEY WENT FURTHER UP THE RIVER AND SOON VANISHED FROM SIGHT THE TATAR DRIVER SAT IN THE CARRIAGE WITH HIS HEAD RESTING ON HIS SHOULDER AND FELL ASLEEP
4484-37119-0040 AFTER WAITING TEN MINUTES THE DEACON CAME OUT OF THE DRYING SHED AND TAKING OFF HIS BLACK HAT THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE NOTICED HE BEGAN THREADING HIS WAY AMONG THE BUSHES AND STRIPS OF MAIZE ALONG THE BANK
4484-37119-0041 CROUCHING AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM THE GRASS AND MAIZE WERE WET AND BIG DROPS FELL ON HIS HEAD FROM THE TREES AND BUSHES DISGRACEFUL HE MUTTERED PICKING UP HIS WET AND MUDDY SKIRT
4484-37119-0042 HAD I REALISED IT I WOULD NOT HAVE COME SOON HE HEARD VOICES AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THEM LAEVSKY WAS WALKING RAPIDLY TO AND FRO IN THE SMALL GLADE WITH BOWED BACK
4484-37119-0043 AND HANDS THRUST IN HIS SLEEVES HIS SECONDS WERE STANDING AT THE WATER'S EDGE ROLLING CIGARETTES STRANGE THOUGHT THE DEACON NOT RECOGNISING LAEVSKY'S WALK
4484-37119-0044 HE LOOKS LIKE AN OLD MAN HOW RUDE IT IS OF THEM SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE POST OFFICE LOOKING AT HIS WATCH IT MAY BE LEARNED MANNERS TO BE LATE BUT TO MY THINKING IT'S HOGGISH
4484-37119-0045 SHESHKOVSKY A STOUT MAN WITH A BLACK BEARD LISTENED AND SAID
