6963-81511-0000 IT IS SURELY THE STUPIDEST OF LOSSES TO CONFUSE THINGS WHICH RIGHT REASON HAS PUT ASUNDER TO LOSE THE SENSE OF ACHIEVED DISTINCTIONS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN POETRY AND PROSE FOR INSTANCE OR TO SPEAK MORE EXACTLY
6963-81511-0001 BETWEEN THE LAWS AND CHARACTERISTIC EXCELLENCES OF VERSE AND PROSE COMPOSITION ON THE OTHER HAND THOSE WHO HAVE DWELT MOST EMPHATICALLY ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PROSE AND VERSE PROSE AND POETRY
6963-81511-0002 MAY SOMETIMES HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO LIMIT THE PROPER FUNCTIONS OF PROSE TOO NARROWLY AND THIS AGAIN IS AT LEAST FALSE ECONOMY AS BEING IN EFFECT THE RENUNCIATION OF A CERTAIN MEANS OR FACULTY IN A WORLD
6963-81511-0003 WHERE AFTER ALL WE MUST NEEDS MAKE THE MOST OF THINGS CRITICAL EFFORTS TO LIMIT ART A PRIORI BY ANTICIPATIONS REGARDING THE NATURAL INCAPACITY OF THE MATERIAL WITH WHICH THIS OR THAT ARTIST WORKS AS THE SCULPTOR WITH SOLID FORM
6963-81511-0004 ARE ALWAYS LIABLE TO BE DISCREDITED BY THE FACTS OF ARTISTIC PRODUCTION AND WHILE PROSE IS ACTUALLY FOUND TO BE A COLOURED THING WITH BACON
6963-81511-0005 MUSICAL WITH CICERO AND NEWMAN
6963-81511-0006 WITH MILTON AND TAYLOR IT WILL BE USELESS TO PROTEST THAT IT CAN BE NOTHING AT ALL EXCEPT SOMETHING VERY TAMELY AND NARROWLY CONFINED TO MAINLY PRACTICAL ENDS
6963-81511-0007 AS USELESS AS THE PROTEST THAT POETRY MIGHT NOT TOUCH PROSAIC SUBJECTS AS WITH WORDSWORTH OR AN ABSTRUSE MATTER AS WITH BROWNING OR TREAT CONTEMPORARY LIFE NOBLY AS WITH TENNYSON
6963-81511-0008 IN SUBORDINATION TO ONE ESSENTIAL BEAUTY IN ALL GOOD LITERARY STYLE IN ALL LITERATURE AS A FINE ART
6963-81511-0009 AND IT IS THE BUSINESS OF CRITICISM TO ESTIMATE THEM AS SUCH AS IT IS GOOD IN THE CRITICISM OF VERSE TO LOOK FOR THOSE HARD LOGICAL AND QUASI PROSAIC EXCELLENCES WHICH THAT TOO HAS OR NEEDS
6963-81511-0010 TO FIND IN THE POEM AMID THE FLOWERS THE ALLUSIONS THE MIXED PERSPECTIVES OF LYCIDAS FOR INSTANCE THE THOUGHT THE LOGICAL STRUCTURE HOW WHOLESOME
6963-81511-0011 AS TO IDENTIFY IN PROSE WHAT WE CALL THE POETRY THE IMAGINATIVE POWER NOT TREATING IT AS OUT OF PLACE AND A KIND OF VAGRANT INTRUDER BUT BY WAY OF AN ESTIMATE OF ITS RIGHTS THAT IS
6963-81511-0012 WITH THE CHARACTERISTIC INSTINCT OF HIS AGE LOVED TO EMPHASISE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN POETRY AND PROSE THE PROTEST AGAINST THEIR CONFUSION WITH EACH OTHER COMING WITH SOMEWHAT DIMINISHED EFFECT FROM ONE WHOSE POETRY WAS SO PROSAIC IN TRUTH
6963-81511-0013 HIS SENSE OF PROSAIC EXCELLENCE AFFECTED HIS VERSE RATHER THAN HIS PROSE WHICH IS NOT ONLY FERVID RICHLY FIGURED POETIC AS WE SAY BUT VITIATED ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY BY MANY A SCANNING LINE
6963-81511-0014 SETTING UP CORRECTNESS THAT HUMBLE MERIT OF PROSE AS THE CENTRAL LITERARY EXCELLENCE HE IS REALLY A LESS CORRECT WRITER THAN HE MAY SEEM STILL WITH AN IMPERFECT MASTERY OF THE RELATIVE PRONOUN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORESEEN THAT
6963-81511-0015 IN THE ROTATIONS OF MIND THE PROVINCE OF POETRY IN PROSE WOULD FIND ITS ASSERTOR AND A CENTURY AFTER DRYDEN AMID VERY DIFFERENT INTELLECTUAL NEEDS AND WITH THE NEED THEREFORE OF GREAT MODIFICATIONS IN LITERARY FORM
6963-81511-0016 THE RANGE OF THE POETIC FORCE IN LITERATURE WAS EFFECTIVELY ENLARGED BY WORDSWORTH THE TRUE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PROSE AND POETRY HE REGARDED AS THE ALMOST TECHNICAL OR ACCIDENTAL ONE OF THE ABSENCE OR PRESENCE OF METRICAL BEAUTY
6963-81511-0017 OR SAY METRICAL RESTRAINT AND FOR HIM THE OPPOSITION CAME TO BE BETWEEN VERSE AND PROSE OF COURSE BUT AS THE ESSENTIAL DICHOTOMY IN THIS MATTER BETWEEN IMAGINATIVE AND UNIMAGINATIVE WRITING
6963-81511-0018 THE LITERATURE OF POWER AND THE LITERATURE OF KNOWLEDGE
6963-81511-0019 BUT HIS PECULIAR SENSE OF FACT WHETHER PAST OR PRESENT DISMISSING THEN UNDER SANCTION OF WORDSWORTH THAT HARSHER OPPOSITION OF POETRY TO PROSE AS SAVOURING IN FACT OF THE ARBITRARY PSYCHOLOGY OF THE LAST CENTURY
6963-81511-0020 AND WITH IT THE PREJUDICE THAT THERE CAN BE BUT ONE ONLY BEAUTY OF PROSE STYLE
6963-81511-0021 WHICH IF THEY APPLY TO THE LITERATURE OF FACT
6963-81511-0022 WHILE THEY APPLY INDIFFERENTLY TO VERSE AND PROSE SO FAR AS EITHER IS REALLY IMAGINATIVE CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF TRUE ART IN BOTH ALIKE
6963-81511-0023 WHICH CONDITIONS MAY ALSO CONTAIN IN THEM THE SECRET OF THE PROPER DISCRIMINATION AND GUARDIANSHIP OF THE PECULIAR EXCELLENCES OF EITHER THE LINE BETWEEN FACT AND SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM EXTERNAL FACT IS INDEED HARD TO DRAW
6963-81511-0024 IN PASCAL FOR INSTANCE IN THE PERSUASIVE WRITERS GENERALLY HOW DIFFICULT TO DEFINE THE POINT WHERE FROM TIME TO TIME ARGUMENT WHICH IF IT IS TO BE WORTH ANYTHING AT ALL MUST CONSIST OF FACTS OR GROUPS OF FACTS
6963-81511-0025 BECOMES A PLEADING A THEOREM NO LONGER BUT ESSENTIALLY AN APPEAL TO THE READER TO CATCH THE WRITER'S SPIRIT TO THINK WITH HIM IF ONE CAN OR WILL AN EXPRESSION NO LONGER OF FACT BUT OF HIS SENSE OF IT
6963-81511-0026 HIS PECULIAR INTUITION OF A WORLD PROSPECTIVE OR DISCERNED BELOW THE FAULTY CONDITIONS OF THE PRESENT
6963-81511-0027 IN SCIENCE ON THE OTHER HAND IN HISTORY SO FAR AS IT CONFORMS TO SCIENTIFIC RULE WE HAVE A LITERARY DOMAIN WHERE THE IMAGINATION MAY BE THOUGHT TO BE ALWAYS AN INTRUDER AND AS IN ALL SCIENCE
6963-81511-0028 THE FUNCTIONS OF LITERATURE REDUCE THEMSELVES EVENTUALLY TO THE TRANSCRIBING OF FACT SO ALL THE EXCELLENCES OF LITERARY FORM IN REGARD TO SCIENCE ARE REDUCIBLE TO VARIOUS KINDS OF PAINS TAKING
6963-81511-0029 IN THE DRAFTING OF AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT AS IN SEWING YET HERE AGAIN THE WRITER'S SENSE OF FACT IN HISTORY ESPECIALLY AND IN ALL THOSE COMPLEX SUBJECTS WHICH DO BUT LIE ON THE BORDERS OF SCIENCE
6963-81511-0030 WILL STILL TAKE THE PLACE OF FACT IN VARIOUS DEGREES YOUR HISTORIAN FOR INSTANCE WITH ABSOLUTELY TRUTHFUL INTENTION AMID THE MULTITUDE OF FACTS PRESENTED TO HIM MUST NEEDS SELECT AND IN SELECTING
6963-81511-0031 ASSERT SOMETHING OF HIS OWN HUMOUR SOMETHING THAT COMES NOT OF THE WORLD WITHOUT BUT OF A VISION WITHIN SO GIBBON MOULDS HIS UNWIELDY MATERIAL TO A PRECONCEIVED VIEW
6963-81511-0032 MOVING FULL OF POIGNANT SENSIBILITY AMID THE RECORDS OF THE PAST EACH AFTER HIS OWN SENSE MODIFIES WHO CAN TELL WHERE AND TO WHAT DEGREE AND BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE THAN A TRANSCRIBER EACH AS HE THUS MODIFIES
6963-81511-0033 PASSING INTO THE DOMAIN OF ART PROPER FOR JUST IN PROPORTION AS THE WRITER'S AIM CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY COMES TO BE THE TRANSCRIBING NOT OF THE WORLD NOT OF MERE FACT
6963-81511-0034 HE BECOMES AN ARTIST HIS WORK FINE ART AND GOOD ART AS I HOPE ULTIMATELY TO SHOW IN PROPORTION TO THE TRUTH OF HIS PRESENTMENT OF THAT SENSE AS IN THOSE HUMBLER OR PLAINER FUNCTIONS OF LITERATURE ALSO
6963-81511-0035 TRUTH TRUTH TO BARE FACT THERE IS THE ESSENCE OF SUCH ARTISTIC QUALITY AS THEY MAY HAVE TRUTH THERE CAN BE NO MERIT NO CRAFT AT ALL WITHOUT THAT AND FURTHER
6963-81511-0036 ALL BEAUTY IS IN THE LONG RUN ONLY FINENESS OF TRUTH OR WHAT WE CALL EXPRESSION THE FINER ACCOMMODATION OF SPEECH TO THAT VISION WITHIN THE TRANSCRIPT OF HIS SENSE OF FACT RATHER THAN THE FACT
6963-81511-0037 AS BEING PREFERABLE PLEASANTER MORE BEAUTIFUL TO THE WRITER HIMSELF IN LITERATURE AS IN EVERY OTHER PRODUCT OF HUMAN SKILL IN THE MOULDING OF A BELL OR A PLATTER FOR INSTANCE WHEREVER THIS SENSE ASSERTS ITSELF
6963-81511-0038 WHEREVER THE PRODUCER SO MODIFIES HIS WORK AS OVER AND ABOVE ITS PRIMARY USE OR INTENTION TO MAKE IT PLEASING TO HIMSELF OF COURSE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THERE
6963-81511-0039 AS OPPOSED TO MERELY SERVICEABLE ART EXISTS LITERARY ART THAT IS LIKE ALL ART WHICH IS IN ANY WAY IMITATIVE OR REPRODUCTIVE OF FACT FORM OR COLOUR OR INCIDENT
6963-81511-0040 IS THE REPRESENTATION OF SUCH FACT AS CONNECTED WITH SOUL OF A SPECIFIC PERSONALITY IN ITS PREFERENCES ITS VOLITION AND POWER SUCH IS THE MATTER OF IMAGINATIVE OR ARTISTIC LITERATURE
6963-81511-0041 THIS TRANSCRIPT NOT OF MERE FACT BUT OF FACT IN ITS INFINITE VARIETY AS MODIFIED BY HUMAN PREFERENCE
6963-81511-0042 IT WILL BE GOOD LITERARY ART NOT BECAUSE IT IS BRILLIANT OR SOBER OR RICH OR IMPULSIVE OR SEVERE BUT JUST IN PROPORTION AS ITS REPRESENTATION OF THAT SENSE THAT SOUL FACT IS TRUE
6963-81511-0043 VERSE BEING ONLY ONE DEPARTMENT OF SUCH LITERATURE AND IMAGINATIVE PROSE IT MAY BE THOUGHT BEING THE SPECIAL ART OF THE MODERN WORLD THAT IMAGINATIVE PROSE SHOULD BE THE SPECIAL AND OPPORTUNE ART OF THE MODERN WORLD
6963-81511-0044 RESULTS FROM TWO IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT THE LATTER FIRST THE CHAOTIC VARIETY AND COMPLEXITY OF ITS INTERESTS MAKING THE INTELLECTUAL ISSUE THE REALLY MASTER CURRENTS OF THE PRESENT TIME INCALCULABLE
6963-81511-0045 A CONDITION OF MIND LITTLE SUSCEPTIBLE OF THE RESTRAINT PROPER TO VERSE FORM SO THAT THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC VERSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAS BEEN LAWLESS VERSE AND SECONDLY AN ALL PERVADING NATURALISM
6963-81511-0046 A CURIOSITY ABOUT EVERYTHING WHATEVER AS IT REALLY IS INVOLVING A CERTAIN HUMILITY OF ATTITUDE COGNATE TO WHAT MUST AFTER ALL BE THE LESS AMBITIOUS FORM OF LITERATURE
6963-81511-0047 AND PROSE THUS ASSERTING ITSELF AS THE SPECIAL AND PRIVILEGED ARTISTIC FACULTY OF THE PRESENT DAY WILL BE HOWEVER CRITICS MAY TRY TO NARROW ITS SCOPE
6963-81511-0048 AND IN WHAT HE PROPOSES TO DO WILL HAVE IN MIND FIRST OF ALL THE SCHOLAR AND THE SCHOLARLY CONSCIENCE THE MALE CONSCIENCE IN THIS MATTER AS WE MUST THINK IT UNDER A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WHICH STILL TO SO LARGE AN EXTENT LIMITS REAL SCHOLARSHIP TO MEN
6963-81511-0049 IN HIS SELF CRITICISM
6963-81511-0050 CONSIDERATELY THOUGH WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR HIM OVER THE GROUND WHICH THE FEMALE CONSCIENCE TRAVERSES SO LIGHTLY SO AMIABLY FOR THE MATERIAL IN WHICH HE WORKS IS NO MORE A CREATION OF HIS OWN THAN THE SCULPTOR'S MARBLE
6963-81511-0051 PRODUCT OF A MYRIAD VARIOUS MINDS AND CONTENDING TONGUES COMPACT OF OBSCURE AND MINUTE ASSOCIATION A LANGUAGE HAS ITS OWN ABUNDANT AND OFTEN RECONDITE LAWS
6963-81511-0052 IN THE HABITUAL AND SUMMARY RECOGNITION OF WHICH SCHOLARSHIP CONSISTS A WRITER FULL OF A MATTER HE IS BEFORE ALL THINGS ANXIOUS TO EXPRESS MAY THINK OF THOSE LAWS THE LIMITATIONS OF VOCABULARY STRUCTURE AND THE LIKE AS A RESTRICTION
6963-81511-0053 HIS PUNCTILIOUS OBSERVANCE OF THE PROPRIETIES OF HIS MEDIUM WILL DIFFUSE THROUGH ALL HE WRITES A GENERAL AIR OF SENSIBILITY OF REFINED USAGE
6963-81511-0054 THE EXCLUSIONS OR REJECTIONS WHICH NATURE DEMANDS WE KNOW HOW LARGE A PART THESE PLAY ACCORDING TO BACON IN THE SCIENCE OF NATURE IN A SOMEWHAT CHANGED SENSE
6963-81511-0055 WE MIGHT SAY THAT THE ART OF THE SCHOLAR IS SUMMED UP IN THE OBSERVANCE OF THOSE REJECTIONS DEMANDED BY THE NATURE OF HIS MEDIUM THE MATERIAL HE MUST USE ALIVE TO THE VALUE OF AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH EVERY TERM FINDS ITS UTMOST DEGREE OF EXPRESSION
6963-81511-0056 AND WITH ALL THE JEALOUSY OF A LOVER OF WORDS HE WILL RESIST A CONSTANT TENDENCY ON THE PART OF THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO USE THEM TO EFFACE THE DISTINCTIONS OF LANGUAGE THE FACILITY OF WRITERS OFTEN REINFORCING IN THIS RESPECT THE WORK OF THE VULGAR
6963-81511-0057 HE WILL FEEL THE OBLIGATION NOT OF THE LAWS ONLY BUT OF THOSE AFFINITIES AVOIDANCES THOSE MERE PREFERENCES OF HIS LANGUAGE WHICH THROUGH THE ASSOCIATIONS OF LITERARY HISTORY HAVE BECOME A PART OF ITS NATURE
6963-81511-0058 PRESCRIBING THE REJECTION OF MANY A NEOLOGY MANY A LICENSE MANY A GIPSY PHRASE WHICH MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF AS ACTUALLY EXPRESSIVE HIS APPEAL AGAIN IS TO THE SCHOLAR WHO HAS GREAT EXPERIENCE IN LITERATURE
6963-81511-0059 AND WILL SHOW NO FAVOUR TO SHORT CUTS OR HACKNEYED ILLUSTRATION OR AN AFFECTATION OF LEARNING DESIGNED FOR THE UNLEARNED HENCE A CONTENTION
6963-81511-0060 HAVING FOR THE SUSCEPTIBLE READER THE EFFECT OF A CHALLENGE FOR MINUTE CONSIDERATION
6963-81511-0061 BEING A PLEDGE THAT IT IS WORTH THE READER'S WHILE TO BE ATTENTIVE TOO THAT THE WRITER IS DEALING SCRUPULOUSLY WITH HIS INSTRUMENT AND THEREFORE INDIRECTLY WITH THE READER HIMSELF ALSO THAT HE HAS THE SCIENCE OF THE INSTRUMENT HE PLAYS ON
6963-81511-0062 PERHAPS AFTER ALL WITH A FREEDOM WHICH IN SUCH CASE WILL BE THE FREEDOM OF A MASTER FOR MEANWHILE BRACED ONLY BY THOSE RESTRAINTS HE IS REALLY VINDICATING HIS LIBERTY IN THE MAKING OF A VOCABULARY
6963-81511-0063 AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF COMPOSITION FOR HIMSELF HIS OWN TRUE MANNER AND WHEN WE SPEAK OF THE MANNER OF A TRUE MASTER WE MEAN WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IN HIS ART PEDANTRY BEING ONLY THE SCHOLARSHIP OF LE CUISTRE
6963-81511-0064 WE HAVE NO ENGLISH EQUIVALENT HE IS NO PEDANT AND DOES BUT SHOW HIS INTELLIGENCE OF THE RULES OF LANGUAGE IN HIS FREEDOMS WITH IT ADDITION OR EXPANSION WHICH LIKE THE SPONTANEITIES OF MANNER IN A WELL BRED PERSON WILL STILL FURTHER ILLUSTRATE GOOD TASTE
6963-81511-0065 THE RIGHT VOCABULARY TRANSLATORS HAVE NOT INVARIABLY SEEN HOW ALL IMPORTANT THAT IS IN THE WORK OF TRANSLATION DRIVING FOR THE MOST PART AT IDIOM OR CONSTRUCTION WHEREAS IF THE ORIGINAL BE FIRST RATE
6963-81511-0066 ONE'S FIRST CARE SHOULD BE WITH ITS ELEMENTARY PARTICLES PLATO FOR INSTANCE BEING OFTEN REPRODUCIBLE BY AN EXACT FOLLOWING WITH NO VARIATION IN STRUCTURE OF WORD AFTER WORD
6963-81511-0067 SO ONLY EACH WORD OR SYLLABLE BE NOT OF FALSE COLOUR TO CHANGE MY ILLUSTRATION A LITTLE WELL THAT IS BECAUSE ANY WRITER WORTH TRANSLATING AT ALL HAS WINNOWED AND SEARCHED THROUGH HIS VOCABULARY
6963-81511-0068 IS CONSCIOUS OF THE WORDS HE WOULD SELECT IN SYSTEMATIC READING OF A DICTIONARY AND STILL MORE OF THE WORDS HE WOULD REJECT WERE THE DICTIONARY OTHER THAN JOHNSON'S AND DOING THIS WITH HIS PECULIAR SENSE OF THE WORLD EVER IN VIEW
6963-81511-0069 IN SEARCH OF AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE ADEQUATE EXPRESSION OF THAT HE BEGETS A VOCABULARY FAITHFUL TO THE COLOURING OF HIS OWN SPIRIT AND IN THE STRICTEST SENSE ORIGINAL THAT LIVING AUTHORITY WHICH LANGUAGE NEEDS LIES IN TRUTH
6963-81511-0070 IN ITS SCHOLARS WHO RECOGNISING ALWAYS THAT EVERY LANGUAGE POSSESSES A GENIUS A VERY FASTIDIOUS GENIUS OF ITS OWN EXPAND AT ONCE AND PURIFY ITS VERY ELEMENTS WHICH MUST NEEDS CHANGE ALONG WITH THE CHANGING THOUGHTS OF LIVING PEOPLE
6963-81511-0071 NINETY YEARS AGO FOR INSTANCE
6963-81511-0072 WAS NEEDED BY WORDSWORTH TO BREAK THROUGH THE CONSECRATED POETIC ASSOCIATIONS OF A CENTURY AND SPEAK THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS HIS THAT WAS TO BECOME IN A MEASURE THE LANGUAGE OF THE NEXT GENERATION BUT HE DID IT WITH THE TACT OF A SCHOLAR ALSO
6963-81511-0073 ENGLISH FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY PAST HAS BEEN ASSIMILATING THE PHRASEOLOGY OF PICTORIAL ART FOR HALF A CENTURY THE PHRASEOLOGY OF THE GREAT GERMAN METAPHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF EIGHTY YEARS AGO IN PART ALSO
6963-81511-0074 AND NONE BUT PEDANTS WILL REGRET A GREAT CONSEQUENT INCREASE OF ITS RESOURCES FOR MANY YEARS TO COME ITS ENTERPRISE MAY WELL LIE IN THE NATURALISATION OF THE VOCABULARY OF SCIENCE SO ONLY IT BE UNDER THE EYE OF A SENSITIVE SCHOLARSHIP
6963-81511-0075 IN A LIBERAL NATURALISATION OF THE IDEAS OF SCIENCE TOO FOR AFTER ALL THE CHIEF STIMULUS OF GOOD STYLE IS TO POSSESS A FULL RICH COMPLEX MATTER TO GRAPPLE WITH THE LITERARY ARTIST THEREFORE
6963-81511-0076 WILL BE WELL AWARE OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE SCIENCE ALSO ATTAINING IN ITS TURN ITS TRUE LITERARY IDEAL AND THEN AS THE SCHOLAR IS NOTHING WITHOUT THE HISTORIC SENSE HE WILL BE APT TO RESTORE NOT REALLY OBSOLETE OR REALLY WORN OUT WORDS
6963-81511-0077 BUT THE FINER EDGE OF WORDS STILL IN USE ASCERTAIN COMMUNICATE DISCOVER
6963-81511-0078 TO MISUSE AND STILL AS LANGUAGE WAS MADE FOR MAN HE WILL BE NO AUTHORITY FOR CORRECTNESSES WHICH LIMITING FREEDOM OF UTTERANCE WERE YET BUT ACCIDENTS IN THEIR ORIGIN
6963-81511-0079 WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IN SHAKESPEARE
6963-81511-0080 FOR INANIMATE OBJECTS BEING BUT A BARBAROUS AND REALLY INEXPRESSIVE SURVIVAL YET WE HAVE KNOWN MANY THINGS LIKE THIS RACY SAXON MONOSYLLABLES CLOSE TO US AS TOUCH AND SIGHT
6963-81511-0081 HE WILL INTERMIX READILY WITH THOSE LONG SAVOURSOME LATIN WORDS
6963-81511-0082 IN THIS LATE DAY CERTAINLY NO CRITICAL PROCESS CAN BE CONDUCTED REASONABLY WITHOUT ECLECTICISM
6963-81511-0083 HOW ILLUSTRATIVE OF MONOSYLLABIC EFFECT OF SONOROUS LATIN OF THE PHRASEOLOGY OF SCIENCE OF METAPHYSIC OF COLLOQUIALISM EVEN ARE THE WRITINGS OF TENNYSON YET WITH WHAT A FINE FASTIDIOUS SCHOLARSHIP THROUGHOUT
6963-81511-0084 A SCHOLAR WRITING FOR THE SCHOLARLY HE WILL OF COURSE LEAVE SOMETHING TO THE WILLING INTELLIGENCE OF HIS READER
6963-81511-0085 TO BECOME TUTOR TO THE IGNORANCE OF THE FIRST I MEET IS A THING I ABHOR
6963-81511-0086 A THING IN FACT NATURALLY DISTRESSING TO THE SCHOLAR WHO WILL THEREFORE EVER BE SHY OF OFFERING UNCOMPLIMENTARY ASSISTANCE TO THE READER'S WIT
6963-81511-0087 TO REALLY STRENUOUS MINDS THERE IS A PLEASURABLE STIMULUS IN THE CHALLENGE FOR A CONTINUOUS EFFORT ON THEIR PART TO BE REWARDED BY SECURER AND MORE INTIMATE GRASP OF THE AUTHOR'S SENSE SELF RESTRAINT A SKILFUL ECONOMY OF MEANS
6963-81511-0088 THAT TOO HAS A BEAUTY OF ITS OWN AND FOR THE READER SUPPOSED THERE WILL BE AN AESTHETIC SATISFACTION IN THAT FRUGAL CLOSENESS OF STYLE WHICH MAKES THE MOST OF A WORD IN THE EXACTION FROM EVERY SENTENCE OF A PRECISE RELIEF
6963-81511-0089 IN THE JUST SPACING OUT OF WORD TO THOUGHT IN THE LOGICALLY FILLED SPACE CONNECTED ALWAYS WITH THE DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF DIFFICULTY OVERCOME DIFFERENT CLASSES OF PERSONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES MAKE OF COURSE VERY VARIOUS DEMANDS UPON LITERATURE
6963-81511-0090 BUT ALL DISINTERESTED LOVERS OF BOOKS WILL ALWAYS LOOK TO IT AS TO ALL OTHER FINE ART FOR A REFUGE A SORT OF CLOISTRAL REFUGE FROM A CERTAIN VULGARITY IN THE ACTUAL WORLD A PERFECT POEM LIKE LYCIDAS
6963-81511-0091 A PERFECT FICTION LIKE ESMOND THE PERFECT HANDLING OF A THEORY LIKE NEWMAN'S IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY HAS FOR THEM SOMETHING OF THE USES
6963-81511-0092 HERE THEN WITH A VIEW TO THE CENTRAL NEED OF A SELECT FEW
6963-81511-0093 EVERYTHING EVERY COMPONENT ELEMENT WILL HAVE UNDERGONE EXACT TRIAL AND ABOVE ALL THERE WILL BE NO UNCHARACTERISTIC OR TARNISHED OR VULGAR DECORATION PERMISSIBLE ORNAMENT BEING FOR THE MOST PART STRUCTURAL OR NECESSARY
6963-81511-0094 AS THE PAINTER IN HIS PICTURE SO THE ARTIST IN HIS BOOK AIMS AT THE PRODUCTION BY HONOURABLE ARTIFICE OF A PECULIAR ATMOSPHERE
6963-81511-0095 MAY BE KNOWN RATHER BY WHAT HE OMITS
6963-81511-0096 THE TRUE ARTIST MAY BE BEST RECOGNISED BY HIS TACT OF OMISSION
6963-81511-0097 AND THE ORNAMENTAL WORD THE FIGURE
6963-81511-0098 IS RARELY CONTENT TO DIE TO THOUGHT PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT MOMENT BUT WILL INEVITABLY LINGER AWHILE
6963-81511-0099 BEHIND IT OF PERHAPS QUITE ALIEN ASSOCIATIONS JUST THERE IT MAY BE
6963-81511-0100 BUT THE TRUE ARTIST ALLOWS FOR IT HE WILL REMEMBER THAT AS THE VERY WORD ORNAMENT INDICATES WHAT IS IN ITSELF NON ESSENTIAL
6963-81511-0101 OF ALL LITERARY STYLE IS OF ITS VERY ESSENCE AND INDEPENDENT IN PROSE AND VERSE ALIKE OF ALL REMOVABLE DECORATION THAT IT MAY EXIST IN ITS FULLEST LUSTRE AS IN FLAUBERT'S MADAME BOVARY FOR INSTANCE OR IN STENDHAL'S
6963-81511-0102 IN A COMPOSITION UTTERLY UNADORNED WITH HARDLY A SINGLE SUGGESTION OF VISIBLY BEAUTIFUL THINGS PARALLEL ALLUSION THE ALLUSIVE WAY GENERALLY THE FLOWERS IN THE GARDEN
6963-81511-0103 HE KNOWS THE NARCOTIC FORCE OF THESE UPON THE NEGLIGENT INTELLIGENCE TO WHICH ANY DIVERSION LITERALLY IS WELCOME ANY VAGRANT INTRUDER BECAUSE ONE CAN GO WANDERING AWAY WITH IT FROM THE IMMEDIATE SUBJECT JEALOUS
6963-81511-0104 IF HE HAVE A REALLY QUICKENING MOTIVE WITHIN OF ALL THAT DOES NOT HOLD DIRECTLY TO THAT OF THE FACILE THE OTIOSE HE WILL NEVER DEPART FROM THE STRICTLY PEDESTRIAN PROCESS UNLESS HE GAINS A PONDERABLE SOMETHING THEREBY
6963-81511-0105 EVEN ASSURED OF ITS CONGRUITY HE WILL STILL QUESTION ITS SERVICEABLENESS IS IT WORTH WHILE CAN WE AFFORD TO ATTEND TO JUST THAT TO JUST THAT FIGURE OR LITERARY REFERENCE JUST THEN
6963-81511-0106 SURPLUSAGE HE WILL DREAD THAT AS THE RUNNER ON HIS MUSCLES FOR IN TRUTH ALL ART DOES BUT CONSIST IN THE REMOVAL OF SURPLUSAGE FROM THE LAST FINISH OF THE GEM ENGRAVER BLOWING AWAY THE LAST PARTICLE OF INVISIBLE DUST
6963-81511-0107 LYING SOMEWHERE ACCORDING TO MICHELANGELO'S FANCY IN THE ROUGH HEWN BLOCK OF STONE AND WHAT APPLIES TO FIGURE OR FLOWER MUST BE UNDERSTOOD OF ALL OTHER ACCIDENTAL OR REMOVABLE ORNAMENTS OF WRITING WHATEVER
6963-81511-0108 AND NOT OF SPECIFIC ORNAMENT ONLY BUT OF ALL THAT LATENT COLOUR AND IMAGERY WHICH LANGUAGE AS SUCH CARRIES IN IT A LOVER OF WORDS FOR THEIR OWN SAKE TO WHOM NOTHING ABOUT THEM IS UNIMPORTANT
6963-81511-0109 A MINUTE AND CONSTANT OBSERVER OF THEIR PHYSIOGNOMY HE WILL BE ON THE ALERT NOT ONLY FOR OBVIOUSLY MIXED METAPHORS OF COURSE BUT FOR THE METAPHOR THAT IS MIXED IN ALL OUR SPEECH THOUGH A RAPID USE MAY INVOLVE NO COGNITION OF IT
6963-81511-0110 CURRENTLY RECOGNISING THE INCIDENT THE COLOUR THE PHYSICAL ELEMENTS OR PARTICLES IN WORDS LIKE ABSORB CONSIDER EXTRACT TO TAKE THE FIRST THAT OCCUR
6963-81511-0111 HE WILL AVAIL HIMSELF OF THEM AS FURTHER ADDING TO THE RESOURCES OF EXPRESSION THE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES OF LANGUAGE WILL BE REALISED AS COLOUR AND LIGHT AND SHADE THROUGH HIS SCHOLARLY LIVING IN THE FULL SENSE OF THEM
6963-81511-0112 STILL OPPOSING THE CONSTANT DEGRADATION OF LANGUAGE BY THOSE WHO USE IT CARELESSLY HE WILL NOT TREAT COLOURED GLASS AS IF IT WERE CLEAR AND WHILE HALF THE WORLD IS USING FIGURE UNCONSCIOUSLY
6963-81511-0113 BUT OF THE VAGUE LAZY HALF FORMED PERSONIFICATION A RHETORIC DEPRESSING
6963-81511-0114 WHICH PLAYS SO LARGE A PART THERE AND AS IN THE CASE OF MORE OSTENTATIOUS ORNAMENT SCRUPULOUSLY EXACT OF IT FROM SYLLABLE TO SYLLABLE ITS PRECISE VALUE
6963-81511-0115 SO FAR I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE LITERARY ART ARISING OUT OF THE MEDIUM OR MATERIAL IN OR UPON WHICH IT WORKS THE ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF LANGUAGE AND ITS APTITUDES FOR CONTINGENT ORNAMENTATION
6963-81511-0116 MATTERS WHICH DEFINE SCHOLARSHIP AS SCIENCE AND GOOD TASTE RESPECTIVELY THEY ARE BOTH SUBSERVIENT TO A MORE INTIMATE QUALITY OF GOOD STYLE MORE INTIMATE AS COMING NEARER TO THE ARTIST HIMSELF
6963-81511-0117 THE OTIOSE THE FACILE SURPLUSAGE WHY ARE THESE ABHORRENT TO THE TRUE LITERARY ARTIST EXCEPT BECAUSE IN LITERARY AS IN ALL OTHER ART STRUCTURE IS ALL IMPORTANT FELT OR PAINFULLY MISSED EVERYWHERE
6963-81511-0118 THAT ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPTION OF WORK WHICH FORESEES THE END IN THE BEGINNING AND NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF IT
6963-81511-0119 WITH UNDIMINISHED VIGOUR UNFOLD AND JUSTIFY THE FIRST A CONDITION OF LITERARY ART WHICH IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO ANOTHER QUALITY OF THE ARTIST HIMSELF TO BE SPOKEN OF LATER
