4487-1799-0000 SHOCKS OF JOY THEY TELL ME SELDOM KILL OF MY OWN KNOWLEDGE I CANNOT SAY FOR I HAVE HAD PRECIOUS LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF SUCH SHOCKS IN MY LIFETIME HEAVEN KNOWS BUT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE
4487-1799-0001 I CAN SAFELY AVER THEY HAD NO SUCH DISMAL EFFECT ON ORMISTON NOTHING EARTHLY COULD HAVE GIVEN THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN A GREATER SHOCK OF JOY THAN THE KNOWLEDGE HE WAS TO BEHOLD THE LONG HIDDEN FACE OF HIS IDOL
4487-1799-0002 THAT THAT FACE WAS UGLY HE DID NOT FOR AN INSTANT BELIEVE OR AT LEAST IT NEVER WOULD BE UGLY TO HIM WITH A FORM SO PERFECT A FORM A SYLPH MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
4487-1799-0003 A VOICE SWEETER THAN THE SINGING FOUNTAIN OF ARABIA HANDS AND FEET THE MOST PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL THE SUN EVER SHONE ON IT WAS SIMPLY A MORAL AND PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY THAT THEY COULD BE JOINED TO A REPULSIVE FACE
4487-1799-0004 THERE WAS A REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS A LITTLE LESS EXQUISITE THAN THOSE RAVISHING ITEMS AND THAT HER MORBID FANCY MADE HER IMAGINE IT HOMELY COMPARED WITH THEM BUT HE KNEW HE NEVER WOULD SHARE IN THAT OPINION
4487-1799-0005 IT WAS THE REASONING OF LOVE RATHER THAN LOGIC
4487-1799-0006 REASON STALKS GRAVELY NOT TO SAY SULKILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AND STANDING AFAR OFF
4487-1799-0007 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE REASON THEREFORE
4487-1799-0008 JOY JOY THAT THRILLED AND VIBRATED THROUGH EVERY NERVE WITHIN HIM LEANING AGAINST THE PORTAL IN AN ABSURD DELIRIUM OF DELIGHT
4487-1799-0009 FROM THE SLIMIEST DEPTHS OF THE SLOUGH OF DESPOND TO THE TOPMOST PEAK OF THE MOUNTAIN OF ECSTASY HE UNCOVERED HIS HEAD THAT THE NIGHT AIR MIGHT COOL ITS FEVERISH THROBBINGS BUT THE NIGHT AIR WAS AS HOT AS HIS HEART AND
4487-1799-0010 ALMOST SUFFOCATED BY THE SULTRY CLOSENESS
4487-1799-0011 FOR ON EVERY HAND ALL WAS SILENT
4487-1799-0012 FOOTSTEPS AND VOICES CAME CLOSER TWO FIGURES TOOK SHAPE IN THE GLOOM AND EMERGED FROM THE DARKNESS INTO THE GLIMMERING LAMP LIGHT HE RECOGNISED THEM BOTH
4487-1799-0013 WITH A STRONG FOREIGN ACCENT I KNOW IT STRUCK TEN AS WE PASSED SAINT PAUL'S THIS GRAND BONFIRE OF OUR MOST WORSHIPFUL LORD MAYOR WILL BE A SIGHT WORTH SEEING REMARKED THE EARL WHEN ALL THESE PILES ARE LIGHTED
4487-1799-0014 THE CITY WILL BE ONE SEA OF FIRE A SLIGHT FORETASTE OF WHAT MOST OF ITS INHABITANTS WILL BEHOLD IN ANOTHER WORLD SAID THE PAGE WITH A FRENCH SHRUG I HAVE HEARD LILLY'S PREDICTION THAT LONDON IS TO BE PURIFIED BY FIRE
4487-1799-0015 LIKE A SECOND SODOM PERHAPS IT IS TO BE VERIFIED TO NIGHT NOT UNLIKELY THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO VIEW THE CONFLAGRATION
4487-1799-0016 AND THE BOATMAN WAITING AS THEY PASSED FROM SIGHT ORMISTON CAME FORTH AND WATCHED THOUGHTFULLY AFTER THEM THE FACE AND FIGURE WERE THAT OF THE LADY BUT THE VOICE WAS DIFFERENT BOTH WERE CLEAR AND MUSICAL ENOUGH
4487-1799-0017 BUT SHE SPOKE ENGLISH WITH THE PUREST ACCENT WHILE HIS WAS THE VOICE OF A FOREIGNER IT MOST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE LIKENESSES WE SOMETIMES SEE AMONG PERFECT STRANGERS BUT THE RESEMBLANCE IN THIS EASE
4487-1799-0018 WAS SOMETHING WONDERFUL IT BROUGHT HIS THOUGHTS BACK FROM HIMSELF AND HIS OWN FORTUNATE LOVE TO HIS VIOLENTLY SMITTEN FRIEND SIR NORMAN AND HIS PLAGUE STRICKEN BELOVED AND HE BEGAN SPECULATING WHAT HE COULD POSSIBLY BE ABOUT JUST THEN
4487-1799-0019 SUDDENLY HE WAS AROUSED A MOMENT BEFORE THE SILENCE HAD BEEN ALMOST OPPRESSIVE BUT NOW ON THE WINGS OF THE NIGHT THERE CAME A SHOUT A TUMULT OF VOICES AND FOOTSTEPS WERE APPROACHING
4487-1799-0020 STOP HER STOP HER WAS CRIED BY MANY VOICES AND THE NEXT INSTANT A FLEET FIGURE WENT FLYING PAST HIM WITH A RUSH
4487-1799-0021 A SLIGHT FEMALE FIGURE WITH FLOATING ROBES OF WHITE WAVING HAIR OF DEEPEST BLACKNESS WITH A SPARKLE OF JEWELS ON NECK AND ARMS ONLY FOR AN INSTANT DID HE SEE IT BUT HE KNEW IT WELL
4487-1799-0022 AND HIS VERY HEART STOOD STILL STOP HER STOP HER SHE IS ILL OF THE PLAGUE SHOUTED THE CROWD PREYING PANTING ON BUT THEY CAME TOO LATE
4487-1799-0023 AND DISAPPEARED WHO IS IT WHAT IS IT WHERE IS IT CRIED TWO OR THREE WATCHMEN BRANDISHING THEIR HALBERDS AND RUSHING UP AND THE CROWD A SMALL MOB OF A DOZEN OR SO
4487-1799-0024 SHE IS DELIRIOUS WITH THE PLAGUE SHE WAS RUNNING THROUGH THE STREETS WE GAVE CHASE BUT SHE OUT STEPPED US AND IS NOW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THAMES ORMISTON WAITED TO HEAR NO MORE BUT RUSHED PRECIPITATELY DOWN TO THE WATERS EDGE
4487-1799-0025 THE ALARM HAS NOW REACHED THE BOATS ON THE RIVER AND MANY EYES WITHIN THEM WERE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE SHE HAD GONE DOWN SOON SHE REAPPEARED ON THE DARK SURFACE SOMETHING WHITER THAN SNOW WHITER THAN DEATH
4487-1799-0026 SHINING LIKE SILVER SHONE THE GLITTERING DRESS AND MARBLE FACE OF THE BRIDE A SMALL BATTEAU LAY CLOSE TO WHERE ORMISTON STOOD IN TWO SECONDS HE HAD SPRANG IN SHOVED IT OFF AND WAS ROWING VIGOROUSLY TOWARD THAT SNOW WREATH IN THE INKY RIVER
4487-1799-0027 BUT HE WAS FORESTALLED TWO HANDS WHITE AND JEWELED AS HER OWN REACHED OVER THE EDGE OF A GILDED BARGE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE BOATMEN LIFTED HER IN BEFORE SHE COULD BE PROPERLY ESTABLISHED ON THE CUSHIONED SEATS
4487-1799-0028 THE BATTEAU WAS ALONGSIDE AND ORMISTON TURNED A VERY WHITE AND EXCITED FACE TOWARD THE EARL OF ROCHESTER
4487-1799-0029 WHY WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE ALONE ON THE RIVER AT THIS HOUR
4487-1799-0030 PRESSING OVER TO LIFT THE LADY MAY I BEG YOU TO ASSIST ME MY LORD
4487-1799-0031 AGAIN AT THE LADY AND LASTLY AT ORMISTON HIS HANDSOME COUNTENANCE FULL OF THE MOST UNMITIGATED WONDER TO WHOM ASKED ORMISTON WHO HAD VERY LITTLE NEED TO INQUIRE
4487-1799-0032 WHY DON'T YOU SEE IT YOURSELF SHE MIGHT BE HIS TWIN SISTER SHE MIGHT BE BUT AS SHE IS NOT
4487-1799-0033 AND I MUST BRING HER BACK TO THEM HE HALF LIFTED HER AS HE SPOKE AND THE BOATMAN GLAD ENOUGH TO GET RID OF ONE SICK OF THE PLAGUE HELPED HER INTO THE BATTEAU THE LADY WAS NOT INSENSIBLE
4487-1799-0034 BUT EXTREMELY WIDE AWAKE AND GAZING AROUND HER WITH HER GREAT BLACK SHINING EYES BUT SHE MADE NO RESISTANCE EITHER SHE WAS TOO FAINT OR FRIGHTENED FOR THAT AND SUFFERED HERSELF TO BE HOISTED ABOUT PASSIVE TO ALL CHANGES
4487-1799-0035 ORMISTON SPREAD HIS CLOAK IN THE STERN OF THE BOAT AND LAID HER TENDERLY UPON IT AND THOUGH THE BEAUTIFUL WISTFUL EYES WERE SOLEMNLY AND UNWINKINGLY FIXED ON HIS FACE THE PALE SWEET LIPS PARTED NOT UTTERED NEVER A WORD
4487-1799-0036 THE WET BRIDAL ROBES WERE DRENCHED AND DRIPPING ABOUT HER THE LONG DARK HAIR HUNG IN SATURATED MASSES OVER HER NECK AND ARMS AND CONTRASTED VIVIDLY WITH A FACE ORMISTON THOUGHT AT ONCE
4487-1799-0037 THE WHITEST MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MOST STONELIKE HE HAD EVER SEEN THANK YOU MY MAN THANK YOU MY LORD SAID ORMISTON PREPARING TO PUSH OFF ROCHESTER WHO HAD BEEN LEANING FROM THE BARGE GAZING IN MINGLED CURIOSITY
4487-1799-0038 TURNED NOW TO HER CHAMPION WHO IS SHE ORMISTON HE SAID PERSUASIVELY BUT ORMISTON ONLY LAUGHED AND ROWED ENERGETICALLY FOR THE SHORE THE CROWD WAS STILL LINGERING
4487-1799-0039 AND HALF A DOZEN HANDS WERE EXTENDED TO DRAW THE BOAT UP TO THE LANDING HE LIFTED THE LIGHT FORM IN HIS ARMS AND BORE IT FROM THE BOAT
4487-1799-0040 AND ASSISTED HER THERE AS TENDERLY AS HE COULD HAVE DONE LA MASQUE HERSELF HE PAUSED ON THE THRESHOLD FOR THE ROOM WAS DARK THERE IS A LAMP AND A TINDER BOX ON THE MANTEL SAID THE FAINT SWEET VOICE
4487-1799-0041 IF YOU WILL ONLY PLEASE TO FIND THEM ORMISTON CROWED THE ROOM FORTUNATELY HE KNEW THE LATITUDE OF THE PLACE AND MOVING HIS HAND WITH GINGERLY PRECAUTION ALONG THE MANTEL SHELF LEST HE SHOULD UPSET ANY OF THE GIMCRACKS THEREON
4487-1799-0042 SOON OBTAINED THE ARTICLES NAMED AND STRUCK A LIGHT THE LADY WAS LEANING WEARILY AGAINST THE DOOR POST BUT NOW SHE CAME FORWARD AND DROPPED EXHAUSTED INTO THE DOWNY PILLOWS OF A LOUNGE IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU MADAME
4487-1799-0043 BEGAN ORMISTON WITH AS SOLICITOUS AN AIR AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN HER FATHER A GLASS OF WINE WOULD BE OF USE TO YOU I THINK AND THEN IF YOU WISH I WILL GO FOR A DOCTOR YOU ARE VERY KIND
4487-1799-0044 YOU WILL FIND WINE AND GLASSES IN THE ROOM OPPOSITE THIS AND I FEEL SO FAINT THAT I THINK YOU HAD BETTER BRING ME SOME ORMISTON MOVED ACROSS THE PASSAGE LIKE THE GOOD OBEDIENT YOUNG MAN THAT HE WAS FILLED A GLASS OF BURGUNDY
4487-1799-0045 WAS STARTLED BY A CRY FROM THE LADY THAT NEARLY MADE HIM DROP AND SHIVER IT ON THE FLOOR WHAT UNDER HEAVEN HAS COME TO HER NOW HE THOUGHT HASTENING IN WONDERING HOW SHE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE COME TO GRIEF SINCE HE LEFT HER SHE WAS SITTING UPRIGHT ON THE SOFA
4487-1799-0046 HER DRESS PALLED DOWN OFF HER SHOULDER WHERE THE PLAGUE SPOT HAD BEEN AND WHICH TO HIS AMAZEMENT HE SAW NOW PURE AND STAINLESS AND FREE FROM EVERY LOATHSOME TRACE YOU ARE CURED OF THE PLAGUE WAS ALL HE COULD SAY
4487-1799-0047 THANK GOD SHE EXCLAIMED FERVENTLY CLASPING HER HANDS
4487-1799-0048 NO IT WAS YOUR PLUNGE INTO THE RIVER I HAVE HEARD OF ONE OR TWO SUCH CASES BEFORE AND IF EVER I TAKE IT SAID ORMISTON HALF LAUGHING HALF SHUDDERING MY FIRST RUSH SHALL BE FOR OLD FATHER THAMES HERE DRINK THIS
4487-1799-0049 THE GIRL SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A GIRL DRANK IT OFF AND SAT UPRIGHT LIKE ONE INSPIRED WITH NEW LIFE AS SHE SET DOWN THE GLASS

4487-1799-0054 AND SEEING YOUR FACE AND HIS BENDING OVER ME ALL THE HORROR CAME BACK WITH THAT AWAKENING AND BETWEEN IT AND ANGUISH OF THE PLAGUE SORE I THINK I FAINTED AGAIN ORMISTON NODDED SAGACIOUSLY
4487-1799-0055 I NOTICED THAT THOUGH I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN DELIRIOUS AND THEN HALF MAD WITH AGONY I GOT OUT TO THE STREET SOMEHOW AND RAN AND RAN AND RAN UNTIL THE PEOPLE SAW AND FOLLOWED ME HERE
4487-1799-0056 I SUPPOSE I HAD SOME IDEA OF REACHING HOME WHEN I CAME HERE BUT THE CROWD PRESSED SO CLOSE BEHIND
4487-1799-0057 AND DROWNING SEEMED TO ME PREFERABLE TO THAT SO I WAS IN THE RIVER BEFORE I KNEW IT AND YOU KNOW THE REST AS WELL AS I DO BUT I OWE YOU MY LIFE MISTER ORMISTON OWE IT TO YOU AND ANOTHER AND I THANK YOU BOTH WITH ALL MY HEART

4487-1799-0062 YOU MUST HAVE HAD A FATHER SOME TIME IN YOUR LIFE MOST PEOPLE HAVE SAID THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN REFLECTIVELY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD A LITTLE SADLY I NEVER HAD THAT I KNOW OF EITHER FATHER OR MOTHER OR ANY ONE BUT PRUDENCE
4487-1799-0063 AND BY THE WAY SHE SAID HALF STARTING UP THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE IS TO SEE ABOUT THIS SAME PRUDENCE SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE PRUDENCE IS NOWHERE IN THE HOUSE SAID ORMISTON QUIETLY AND WILL NOT BE SHE SAYS
