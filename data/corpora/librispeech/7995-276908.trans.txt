7995-276908-0000 THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN TO APPEAR TO BE WHAT SHE REALLY IS NOT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS HAD PAST SINCE ANY INTERVIEW BETWEEN MISTER BOOTH AND MISS MATTHEWS AND THEIR MEETING NOW IN SO EXTRAORDINARY A PLACE
7995-276908-0001 AFFECTED BOTH OF THEM WITH AN EQUAL SURPRIZE AFTER SOME IMMATERIAL CEREMONIES THE LADY ACQUAINTED MISTER BOOTH THAT HAVING HEARD THERE WAS A PERSON IN THE PRISON WHO KNEW HER BY THE NAME OF MATTHEWS
7995-276908-0002 SHE HAD GREAT CURIOSITY TO INQUIRE WHO HE WAS WHEREUPON HE HAD BEEN SHEWN TO HER FROM THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE THAT SHE IMMEDIATELY RECOLLECTED HIM AND BEING INFORMED OF HIS DISTRESSFUL SITUATION
7995-276908-0003 FOR WHICH SHE EXPRESSED GREAT CONCERN SHE HAD SENT HIM THAT GUINEA WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED THE DAY BEFORE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO EXCUSE HERSELF FOR NOT HAVING DESIRED TO SEE HIM AT THAT TIME
7995-276908-0004 WHEN SHE WAS UNDER THE GREATEST DISORDER AND HURRY OF SPIRITS BOOTH MADE MANY HANDSOME ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF HER FAVOUR AND ADDED THAT HE VERY LITTLE WONDERED AT THE DISORDER OF HER SPIRITS CONCLUDING THAT HE WAS HEARTILY CONCERNED AT SEEING HER THERE
7995-276908-0005 HERE HE HESITATED UPON WHICH BURSTING INTO AN AGONY OF TEARS SHE CRIED OUT O CAPTAIN CAPTAIN MANY EXTRAORDINARY THINGS HAVE PASSED SINCE LAST I SAW YOU O GRACIOUS HEAVEN
7995-276908-0006 DID I EVER EXPECT THAT THIS WOULD BE THE NEXT PLACE OF OUR MEETING SHE THEN FLUNG HERSELF INTO HER CHAIR WHERE SHE GAVE A LOOSE TO HER PASSION WHILST HE IN THE MOST AFFECTIONATE AND TENDER MANNER ENDEAVOURED TO SOOTHE AND COMFORT HER
7995-276908-0007 HAVING VENTED THIS IN A LARGE FLOOD OF TEARS SHE BECAME PRETTY WELL COMPOSED BUT BOOTH UNHAPPILY MENTIONING HER FATHER
7995-276908-0008 I HAVE DISGRACED HIM MISTER BOOTH I AM UNWORTHY THE NAME OF HIS DAUGHTER HERE PASSION AGAIN STOPPED HER WORDS AND DISCHARGED ITSELF IN TEARS
7995-276908-0009 AFTER THIS SECOND VENT OF SORROW OR SHAME OR IF THE READER PLEASES OF RAGE SHE ONCE MORE RECOVERED FROM HER AGONIES TO SAY THE TRUTH THESE ARE I BELIEVE AS CRITICAL DISCHARGES OF NATURE
7995-276908-0010 AS ANY OF THOSE WHICH ARE SO CALLED BY THE PHYSICIANS AND DO MORE EFFECTUALLY RELIEVE THE MIND THAN ANY REMEDIES WITH WHICH THE WHOLE MATERIA MEDICA OF PHILOSOPHY CAN SUPPLY IT
7995-276908-0011 WHEN MISSUS VINCENT HAD RECOVERED HER FACULTIES SHE PERCEIVED BOOTH STANDING SILENT WITH A MIXTURE OF CONCERN AND ASTONISHMENT IN HIS COUNTENANCE THEN ADDRESSING HERSELF TO HIM WITH AN AIR OF MOST BEWITCHING SOFTNESS
7995-276908-0012 OF WHICH SHE WAS A PERFECT MISTRESS SHE SAID I DO NOT WONDER AT YOUR AMAZEMENT CAPTAIN BOOTH NOR INDEED AT THE CONCERN WHICH YOU SO PLAINLY DISCOVER FOR ME FOR I WELL KNOW THE GOODNESS OF YOUR NATURE
7995-276908-0013 YOU ARE A STRANGER TO THE CAUSE OF MY SORROWS I HOPE I AM MADAM ANSWERED HE FOR I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE HEARD IN THE PRISON SURELY MURDER AT WHICH WORDS SHE STARTED FROM HER CHAIR REPEATING
7995-276908-0014 MURDER OH IT IS MUSIC IN MY EARS YOU HAVE HEARD THEN THE CAUSE OF MY COMMITMENT MY GLORY MY DELIGHT MY REPARATION
7995-276908-0015 THIS IS THE HAND THIS IS THE ARM THAT DROVE THE PENKNIFE TO HIS HEART UNKIND FORTUNE THAT NOT ONE DROP OF HIS BLOOD REACHED MY HAND INDEED SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE WASHED IT FROM IT
7995-276908-0016 BUT THOUGH I HAVE NOT THE HAPPINESS TO SEE IT ON MY HAND I HAVE THE GLORIOUS SATISFACTION OF REMEMBERING I SAW IT RUN IN RIVERS ON THE FLOOR I SAW IT FORSAKE HIS CHEEKS
7995-276908-0017 NOT OF THAT MONSTER MAN MISTER BOOTH I AM UNDONE AM REVENGED AND HAVE NOW NO MORE BUSINESS FOR LIFE LET THEM TAKE IT FROM ME WHEN THEY WILL OUR POOR GENTLEMAN TURNED PALE WITH HORROR AT THIS SPEECH
7995-276908-0018 AND THE EJACULATION OF GOOD HEAVENS WHAT DO I HEAR BURST SPONTANEOUSLY FROM HIS LIPS NOR CAN WE WONDER AT THIS THOUGH HE WAS THE BRAVEST OF MEN FOR HER VOICE HER LOOKS HER GESTURES
7995-276908-0019 WERE PROPERLY ADAPTED TO THE SENTIMENTS SHE EXPREST SUCH INDEED WAS HER IMAGE THAT NEITHER COULD SHAKSPEAR DESCRIBE NOR HOGARTH PAINT NOR CLIVE ACT A FURY IN HIGHER PERFECTION
7995-276908-0020 WHAT DO YOU HEAR REITERATED SHE YOU HEAR THE RESENTMENT OF THE MOST INJURED OF WOMEN YOU HAVE HEARD YOU SAY OF THE MURDER BUT DO YOU KNOW THE CAUSE MISTER BOOTH HAVE YOU SINCE YOUR RETURN TO ENGLAND VISITED THAT COUNTRY
7995-276908-0021 WHERE WE FORMERLY KNEW ONE ANOTHER TELL ME DO YOU KNOW MY WRETCHED STORY TELL ME THAT MY FRIEND BOOTH HESITATED FOR AN ANSWER INDEED HE HAD HEARD SOME IMPERFECT STORIES NOT MUCH TO HER ADVANTAGE
7995-276908-0022 THAT I SHOULD EVER HAVE BEEN FOUND IN NOR CAN YOU KNOW THE CAUSE OF ALL THAT I HAVE UTTERED AND WHICH I AM CONVINCED YOU NEVER EXPECTED TO HAVE HEARD FROM MY MOUTH IF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RAISE YOUR CURIOSITY
7995-276908-0023 I WILL SATISFY IT HE ANSWERED THAT CURIOSITY WAS TOO MEAN A WORD TO EXPRESS HIS ARDENT DESIRE OF KNOWING HER STORY UPON WHICH WITH VERY LITTLE PREVIOUS CEREMONY
7995-276908-0024 SHE BEGAN TO RELATE WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE FOLLOWING CHAPTER BUT BEFORE WE PUT AN END TO THIS IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO WHISPER A WORD OR TWO TO THE CRITICS WHO HAVE PERHAPS BEGUN TO EXPRESS NO LESS ASTONISHMENT THAN MISTER BOOTH
7995-276908-0025 THAT A LADY IN WHOM WE HAD REMARKED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY POWER OF DISPLAYING SOFTNESS SHOULD THE VERY NEXT MOMENT AFTER THE WORDS WERE OUT OF HER MOUTH EXPRESS SENTIMENTS BECOMING THE LIPS OF
7995-276908-0026 JOAN OF NAPLES CHRISTINA OF SWEDEN KATHARINE HAYS SARAH MALCOLM CON PHILIPS
7995-276908-0027 FOOTNOTE THOUGH LAST NOT LEAST
7995-276908-0028 OR ANY OTHER HEROINE OF THE TENDER SEX WHICH HISTORY SACRED OR PROFANE ANCIENT OR MODERN FALSE OR TRUE HATH RECORDED WE DESIRE SUCH CRITICS TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS THE SAME ENGLISH CLIMATE
7995-276908-0029 IN WHICH ON THE LOVELY TENTH OF JUNE UNDER A SERENE SKY THE AMOROUS JACOBITE KISSING THE ODORIFEROUS ZEPHYR'S BREATH GATHERS A NOSEGAY OF WHITE ROSES TO DECK THE WHITER BREAST OF CELIA
7995-276908-0030 AND IN WHICH ON THE ELEVENTH OF JUNE THE VERY NEXT DAY THE BOISTEROUS BOREAS ROUSED BY THE HOLLOW THUNDER RUSHES HORRIBLE THROUGH THE AIR AND DRIVING THE WET TEMPEST BEFORE HIM LEVELS THE HOPE OF THE HUSBANDMAN WITH THE EARTH
7995-276908-0031 SOFT AND DELICATE WHO WITH A VOICE THE SWEETNESS OF WHICH THE SYRENS MIGHT ENVY WARBLES THE HARMONIOUS SONG IN PRAISE OF THE YOUNG ADVENTURER AND AGAIN THE NEXT DAY OR PERHAPS THE NEXT HOUR
7995-276908-0032 WITH FIERY EYES WRINKLED BROWS AND FOAMING LIPS ROARS FORTH TREASON AND NONSENSE IN A POLITICAL ARGUMENT WITH SOME FAIR ONE OF A DIFFERENT PRINCIPLE OR IF THE CRITIC BE A WHIG
7995-276908-0033 AND CONSEQUENTLY DISLIKES SUCH KIND OF SIMILES AS BEING TOO FAVOURABLE TO JACOBITISM LET HIM BE CONTENTED WITH THE FOLLOWING STORY I HAPPENED IN MY YOUTH TO SIT BEHIND TWO LADIES IN A SIDE BOX AT A PLAY
7995-276908-0034 WHERE IN THE BALCONY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WAS PLACED THE INIMITABLE B
7995-276908-0035 IN COMPANY WITH A YOUNG FELLOW OF NO VERY FORMAL OR INDEED SOBER APPEARANCE ONE OF THE LADIES I REMEMBER SAID TO THE OTHER DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING LOOK SO MODEST
7995-276908-0036 FOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE A GREATER APPEARANCE OF MODESTY INNOCENCE AND SIMPLICITY THAN WHAT NATURE HAD DISPLAYED IN THE COUNTENANCE OF THAT GIRL AND YET ALL APPEARANCES NOTWITHSTANDING I MYSELF
