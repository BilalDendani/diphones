7475-232691-0000 YE HAVE SAID THAT YE COULD NOT WORSHIP YOUR GOD BECAUSE YE ARE CAST OUT OF YOUR SYNAGOGUES BUT BEHOLD I SAY UNTO YOU IF YE SUPPOSE THAT YE CANNOT WORSHIP GOD YE DO GREATLY ERR
7475-232691-0001 YE MUST BELIEVE WHAT ZENOS SAID FOR BEHOLD HE SAID THOU HAST TURNED AWAY THY JUDGMENTS BECAUSE OF THY SON
7475-232691-0002 THOU ART ANGRY O LORD WITH THIS PEOPLE
7475-232691-0003 YE SEE THAT A SECOND PROPHET OF OLD HAS TESTIFIED OF THE SON OF GOD
7475-232691-0004 HE WAS SPOKEN OF BY MOSES YEA AND BEHOLD A TYPE WAS RAISED UP IN THE WILDERNESS THAT WHOSOEVER WOULD LOOK UPON IT MIGHT LIVE
7475-232691-0005 AND THIS BECAUSE OF THE HARDNESS OF THEIR HEARTS BUT THERE WERE MANY WHO WERE SO HARDENED THAT THEY WOULD NOT LOOK THEREFORE THEY PERISHED
7475-232691-0006 IF YE COULD BE HEALED BY MERELY CASTING ABOUT YOUR EYES THAT YE MIGHT BE HEALED WOULD YE NOT BEHOLD QUICKLY OR WOULD YE RATHER HARDEN YOUR HEARTS IN UNBELIEF AND BE SLOTHFUL THAT YE WOULD NOT CAST ABOUT YOUR EYES
7475-232691-0007 BUT IF NOT SO THEN CAST ABOUT YOUR EYES AND BEGIN TO BELIEVE IN THE SON OF GOD THAT HE WILL COME TO REDEEM HIS PEOPLE AND THAT HE SHALL SUFFER AND DIE TO ATONE FOR THEIR SINS
7475-232691-0008 AND THAT HE SHALL RISE AGAIN FROM THE DEAD WHICH SHALL BRING TO PASS THE RESURRECTION THAT ALL MEN SHALL STAND BEFORE HIM TO BE JUDGED AT THE LAST AND JUDGMENT DAY
7475-232691-0009 AND AS IT BEGINNETH TO SWELL EVEN SO NOURISH IT BY YOUR FAITH AND BEHOLD IT WILL BECOME A TREE SPRINGING UP IN YOU UNTO EVERLASTING LIFE AND THEN MAY GOD GRANT UNTO YOU
7475-232691-0010 THAT YOUR BURDENS MAY BE LIGHT THROUGH THE JOY OF HIS SON
7475-232691-0011 FOR ACCORDING TO THE GREAT PLAN OF THE ETERNAL GOD THERE MUST BE AN ATONEMENT MADE OR ELSE ALL MANKIND MUST UNAVOIDABLY PERISH YEA ALL ARE HARDENED YEA ALL ARE FALLEN AND ARE LOST AND MUST PERISH EXCEPT IT BE THROUGH THE ATONEMENT
7475-232691-0012 YEA NOT A SACRIFICE OF MAN NEITHER OF BEAST NEITHER OF ANY MANNER OF FOWL FOR IT SHALL NOT BE A HUMAN SACRIFICE BUT IT MUST BE AN INFINITE
7475-232691-0013 WHICH WILL ATONE FOR THE SINS OF ANOTHER NOW IF A MAN MURDERETH BEHOLD WILL OUR LAW WHICH IS JUST TAKE THE LIFE OF HIS BROTHER
7475-232691-0014 THEREFORE THERE CAN BE NOTHING WHICH IS SHORT OF AN INFINITE ATONEMENT
7475-232691-0015 AND THEN SHALL THERE BE OR IT IS EXPEDIENT THERE SHOULD BE A STOP TO THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD THEN SHALL THE LAW OF MOSES BE FULFILLED YEA IT SHALL BE ALL FULFILLED EVERY JOT AND TITTLE
7475-232691-0016 EVERY WHIT POINTING TO THAT GREAT AND LAST SACRIFICE AND THAT GREAT AND LAST SACRIFICE WILL BE THE SON OF GOD YEA INFINITE
7475-232691-0017 THIS BEING THE INTENT OF THIS LAST SACRIFICE TO BRING ABOUT THE BOWELS OF MERCY WHICH OVERPOWERETH JUSTICE AND BRINGETH ABOUT MEANS UNTO MEN THAT THEY MAY HAVE FAITH
7475-232691-0018 AND ENCIRCLES THEM IN THE ARMS OF SAFETY WHILE HE THAT EXERCISES NO FAITH UNTO REPENTANCE IS EXPOSED TO THE WHOLE LAW OF THE DEMANDS OF JUSTICE THEREFORE ONLY UNTO HIM THAT HAS FAITH UNTO REPENTANCE
7475-232691-0019 THAT YE MAY BEGIN TO EXERCISE YOUR FAITH UNTO REPENTANCE THAT YE BEGIN TO CALL UPON HIS HOLY NAME
7475-232691-0020 YEA OVER ALL YOUR HOUSEHOLD BOTH MORNING
7475-232691-0021 YE MUST POUR OUT YOUR SOULS IN YOUR CLOSETS AND YOUR SECRET PLACES
7475-232691-0022 LET YOUR HEARTS BE FULL DRAWN OUT IN PRAYER UNTO HIM CONTINUALLY FOR YOUR WELFARE
7475-232691-0023 DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THIS IS ALL FOR AFTER YE HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS IF YE TURN AWAY THE NEEDY AND THE NAKED AND VISIT NOT THE SICK AND AFFLICTED AND IMPART OF YOUR SUBSTANCE IF YE HAVE TO THOSE WHO STAND IN NEED
7475-232691-0024 I SAY UNTO YOU IF YE DO NOT ANY OF THESE THINGS BEHOLD YOUR PRAYER IS VAIN AND AVAILETH YOU NOTHING AND YE ARE AS HYPOCRITES
7475-232691-0025 IF YE DO NOT REMEMBER TO BE CHARITABLE YE ARE AS DROSS WHICH THE REFINERS DO CAST OUT IT BEING OF NO WORTH
7475-232691-0026 SEEING THAT THE HOLY SCRIPTURES TESTIFY OF THESE THINGS
7475-232691-0027 FOR BEHOLD NOW IS THE TIME AND THE DAY OF YOUR SALVATION AND THEREFORE IF YE WILL REPENT AND HARDEN NOT YOUR HEARTS
7475-232691-0028 THIS LIFE IS THE TIME FOR MEN TO PREPARE TO MEET GOD
7475-232691-0029 AS YE HAVE HAD SO MANY WITNESSES THEREFORE I BESEECH OF YOU THAT YE DO NOT PROCRASTINATE THE DAY OF YOUR REPENTANCE UNTIL THE END FOR AFTER THIS DAY OF LIFE WHICH IS GIVEN US TO PREPARE FOR ETERNITY
7475-232691-0030 BEHOLD IF WE DO NOT IMPROVE OUR TIME WHILE IN THIS LIFE THEN COMETH THE NIGHT OF DARKNESS
7475-232691-0031 WHEN YE ARE BROUGHT TO THAT AWFUL CRISIS THAT I WILL REPENT THAT I WILL RETURN TO MY GOD NAY YE CANNOT SAY THIS FOR THAT SAME SPIRIT WHICH DOTH POSSESS YOUR BODIES AT THE TIME THAT YE GO OUT OF THIS LIFE THAT SAME SPIRIT
7475-232691-0032 BEHOLD YE HAVE BECOME SUBJECTED TO THE SPIRIT OF THE DEVIL AND HE DOTH SEAL YOU HIS THEREFORE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD HATH WITHDRAWN FROM YOU AND HATH NO PLACE IN YOU AND THE DEVIL HATH ALL POWER OVER YOU AND THIS
7475-232691-0033 BUT IN THE HEARTS OF THE RIGHTEOUS DOTH HE DWELL YEA AND HE HAS ALSO SAID THAT THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL SIT DOWN IN HIS KINGDOM TO GO NO MORE OUT
7475-232691-0034 I DESIRE THAT YE SHOULD REMEMBER THESE THINGS AND THAT YE SHOULD WORK OUT YOUR SALVATION WITH FEAR BEFORE GOD
7475-232691-0035 BUT THAT YE RECEIVE IT AND TAKE UPON YOU THE NAME OF CHRIST THAT YE HUMBLE YOURSELVES EVEN TO THE DUST AND WORSHIP GOD IN WHATSOEVER PLACE YE MAY BE IN IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH AND THAT YE LIVE IN THANKSGIVING DAILY
7475-232691-0036 THAT YE BE WATCHFUL UNTO PRAYER CONTINUALLY THAT YE MAY NOT BE LED AWAY BY THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE DEVIL THAT HE MAY NOT OVERPOWER YOU THAT YE MAY NOT BECOME HIS SUBJECTS AT THE LAST DAY FOR BEHOLD HE REWARDETH YOU
7475-232691-0037 I WOULD EXHORT YOU TO HAVE PATIENCE AND THAT YE BEAR WITH ALL MANNER OF AFFLICTIONS THAT YE DO NOT REVILE AGAINST THOSE WHO DO CAST YOU OUT BECAUSE OF YOUR EXCEEDING POVERTY
