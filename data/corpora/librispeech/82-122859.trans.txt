82-122859-0000 A CONCERT A CATASTROPHE AND A CONFESSION MARILLA
82-122859-0001 SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE VERY BADLY OFF TO SEE HER AGAIN BUT SHE WANTS TO SEE ME PLEADED ANNE SHE HAS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL ME HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE HAS
82-122859-0002 TWO FLASHES MEAN ARE YOU THERE THREE MEAN YES AND FOUR NO
82-122859-0003 DIANA HAS JUST SIGNALED FIVE FLASHES AND I'M REALLY SUFFERING TO KNOW WHAT IT IS WELL YOU NEEDN'T SUFFER ANY LONGER SAID MARILLA SARCASTICALLY YOU CAN GO BUT YOU'RE TO BE BACK HERE IN JUST TEN MINUTES REMEMBER THAT
82-122859-0004 ANNE DID REMEMBER IT AND WAS BACK IN THE STIPULATED TIME ALTHOUGH PROBABLY NO MORTAL WILL EVER KNOW JUST WHAT IT COST HER TO CONFINE THE DISCUSSION OF DIANA'S IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE LIMITS OF TEN MINUTES BUT AT LEAST SHE HAD MADE GOOD USE OF THEM
82-122859-0005 OH MARILLA WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW TOMORROW IS DIANA'S BIRTHDAY WELL HER MOTHER TOLD HER SHE COULD ASK ME TO GO HOME WITH HER FROM SCHOOL AND STAY ALL NIGHT WITH HER
82-122859-0006 AND THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE DIANA AND ME TO THE CONCERT IF YOU'LL LET ME GO THAT IS YOU WILL WON'T YOU MARILLA OH I FEEL SO EXCITED YOU CAN CALM DOWN THEN BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING
82-122859-0007 I'M SURE THE DEBATING CLUB IS A MOST RESPECTABLE AFFAIR PLEADED ANNE I'M NOT SAYING IT ISN'T
82-122859-0008 THAT WILL BE JUST ABOUT THE SAME THING AS A SERMON PLEASE MAYN'T I GO MARILLA YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID ANNE DIDN'T YOU TAKE OFF YOUR BOOTS NOW AND GO TO BED IT'S PAST EIGHT THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING MARILLA
82-122859-0009 SAID ANNE WITH THE AIR OF PRODUCING THE LAST SHOT IN HER LOCKER MISSUS BARRY TOLD DIANA THAT WE MIGHT SLEEP IN THE SPARE ROOM BED
82-122859-0010 OPENED HIS EYES AND SAID DECIDEDLY WELL NOW MARILLA
82-122859-0011 I DON'T THEN RETORTED MARILLA WHO'S BRINGING THIS CHILD UP MATTHEW YOU OR ME WELL NOW YOU ADMITTED MATTHEW DON'T INTERFERE THEN WELL NOW I AIN'T INTERFERING
82-122859-0012 IT AIN'T INTERFERING TO HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION AND MY OPINION IS THAT YOU OUGHT TO LET ANNE GO
82-122859-0013 BUT I DON'T APPROVE OF THIS CONCERT PLAN
82-122859-0014 IT WOULD UNSETTLE HER FOR A WEEK I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD'S DISPOSITION AND WHAT'S GOOD FOR IT BETTER THAN YOU MATTHEW I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LET ANNE GO REPEATED MATTHEW FIRMLY ARGUMENT WAS NOT HIS STRONG POINT BUT HOLDING FAST TO HIS OPINION CERTAINLY WAS
82-122859-0015 MARILLA GAVE A GASP OF HELPLESSNESS AND TOOK REFUGE IN SILENCE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN ANNE WAS WASHING THE BREAKFAST DISHES IN THE PANTRY MATTHEW PAUSED ON HIS WAY OUT TO THE BARN TO SAY TO MARILLA AGAIN I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LET ANNE GO MARILLA
82-122859-0016 FOR A MOMENT MARILLA LOOKED THINGS NOT LAWFUL TO BE UTTERED THEN SHE YIELDED TO THE INEVITABLE AND SAID TARTLY VERY WELL SHE CAN GO SINCE NOTHING ELSE'LL PLEASE YOU ANNE FLEW OUT OF THE PANTRY DRIPPING DISHCLOTH IN HAND
82-122859-0017 I GUESS ONCE IS ENOUGH TO SAY THEM
82-122859-0018 DON'T BLAME ME BLAME MATTHEW ANNE SHIRLEY YOU'RE DRIPPING GREASY WATER ALL OVER THE FLOOR I NEVER SAW SUCH A CARELESS CHILD
82-122859-0019 SAID ANNE REPENTANTLY I MAKE SO MANY MISTAKES BUT THEN JUST THINK OF ALL THE MISTAKES I DON'T MAKE ALTHOUGH I MIGHT I'LL GET SOME SAND AND SCRUB UP THE SPOTS BEFORE I GO TO SCHOOL OH MARILLA MY HEART WAS JUST SET ON GOING TO THAT CONCERT I NEVER WAS TO A CONCERT IN MY LIFE
82-122859-0020 BUT YOU SEE MATTHEW DID MATTHEW UNDERSTANDS ME AND IT'S SO NICE TO BE UNDERSTOOD MARILLA ANNE WAS TOO EXCITED TO DO HERSELF JUSTICE AS TO LESSONS THAT MORNING IN SCHOOL
82-122859-0021 SHE AND DIANA TALKED SO CONSTANTLY ABOUT IT ALL DAY THAT WITH A STRICTER TEACHER THAN MISTER PHILLIPS DIRE DISGRACE
82-122859-0022 ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE BORNE IT IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN GOING TO THE CONCERT FOR NOTHING ELSE WAS DISCUSSED THAT DAY IN SCHOOL THE AVONLEA DEBATING CLUB WHICH MET FORTNIGHTLY ALL WINTER HAD HAD SEVERAL SMALLER FREE ENTERTAINMENTS
82-122859-0023 BUT THIS WAS TO BE A BIG AFFAIR ADMISSION TEN CENTS IN AID OF THE LIBRARY
82-122859-0024 AND ALL THE SCHOLARS WERE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN IT BY REASON OF OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO WERE GOING TO TAKE PART EVERYBODY IN SCHOOL OVER NINE YEARS OF AGE EXPECTED TO GO EXCEPT CARRIE SLOANE
82-122859-0025 THEY HAD A PERFECTLY ELEGANT TEA AND THEN CAME THE DELICIOUS OCCUPATION OF DRESSING IN DIANA'S LITTLE ROOM UPSTAIRS
82-122859-0026 AT LAST THEY WERE READY CHEEKS SCARLET AND EYES GLOWING WITH EXCITEMENT TRUE ANNE COULD NOT HELP A LITTLE PANG WHEN SHE CONTRASTED HER PLAIN BLACK TAM AND SHAPELESS TIGHT SLEEVED HOMEMADE GRAY CLOTH COAT
82-122859-0027 WITH DIANA'S JAUNTY FUR CAP AND SMART LITTLE JACKET BUT SHE REMEMBERED IN TIME THAT SHE HAD AN IMAGINATION AND COULD USE IT THEN DIANA'S COUSINS THE MURRAYS FROM NEWBRIDGE CAME
82-122859-0028 THEY ALL CROWDED INTO THE BIG PUNG SLEIGH AMONG STRAW AND FURRY ROBES
82-122859-0029 THERE WAS A MAGNIFICENT SUNSET AND THE SNOWY HILLS AND DEEP BLUE WATER OF THE SAINT LAWRENCE GULF SEEMED TO RIM IN THE SPLENDOR LIKE A HUGE BOWL OF PEARL AND SAPPHIRE BRIMMED WITH WINE AND FIRE
82-122859-0030 TINKLES OF SLEIGH BELLS AND DISTANT LAUGHTER THAT SEEMED LIKE THE MIRTH OF WOOD ELVES CAME FROM EVERY QUARTER OH DIANA BREATHED ANNE SQUEEZING DIANA'S MITTENED HAND UNDER THE FUR ROBE
82-122859-0031 ISN'T IT ALL LIKE A BEAUTIFUL DREAM DO I REALLY LOOK THE SAME AS USUAL
82-122859-0032 YOU'VE GOT THE LOVELIEST COLOR
82-122859-0033 AND AS ANNE ASSURED DIANA EVERY SUCCEEDING THRILL WAS THRILLIER THAN THE LAST WHEN PRISSY ANDREWS ATTIRED IN A NEW PINK SILK WAIST WITH A STRING OF PEARLS ABOUT HER SMOOTH WHITE THROAT AND REAL CARNATIONS IN HER HAIR
82-122859-0034 WHEN SAM SLOANE PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN AND ILLUSTRATE HOW SOCKERY SET A HEN ANNE LAUGHED UNTIL PEOPLE SITTING NEAR HER LAUGHED TOO MORE OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH HER THAN WITH AMUSEMENT AT A SELECTION THAT WAS RATHER THREADBARE EVEN IN AVONLEA
82-122859-0035 LOOKING AT PRISSY ANDREWS AT THE END OF EVERY SENTENCE ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD RISE AND MUTINY ON THE SPOT IF BUT ONE ROMAN CITIZEN LED THE WAY ONLY ONE NUMBER ON THE PROGRAM FAILED TO INTEREST HER WHEN GILBERT BLYTHE RECITED
82-122859-0036 BINGEN ON THE RHINE ANNE PICKED UP RHODA MURRAY'S LIBRARY BOOK AND READ IT UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED
82-122859-0037 IT WAS ELEVEN WHEN THEY GOT HOME SATED WITH DISSIPATION BUT WITH THE EXCEEDING SWEET PLEASURE OF TALKING IT ALL OVER STILL TO COME
82-122859-0038 ANNE AND DIANA TIPTOED INTO THE PARLOR A LONG NARROW ROOM OUT OF WHICH THE SPARE ROOM OPENED IT WAS PLEASANTLY WARM AND DIMLY LIGHTED BY THE EMBERS OF A FIRE IN THE GRATE
82-122859-0039 SIGHED ANNE RAPTUROUSLY IT MUST BE SPLENDID TO GET UP AND RECITE THERE DO YOU SUPPOSE WE WILL EVER BE ASKED TO DO IT DIANA YES OF COURSE SOMEDAY THEY'RE ALWAYS WANTING THE BIG SCHOLARS TO RECITE
