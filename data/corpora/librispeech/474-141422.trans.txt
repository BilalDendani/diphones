474-141422-0000 A DISPUTED AUTHORSHIP HOW ARE YOU CHARON SAID SHAKESPEARE AS THE JANITOR ASSISTED HIM ON BOARD ANY ONE HERE TO NIGHT YES SIR SAID CHARON LORD BACON IS UP IN THE LIBRARY
474-141422-0001 AND DOCTOR JOHNSON IS DOWN IN THE BILLIARD ROOM PLAYING POOL WITH NERO HA HA LAUGHED SHAKESPEARE POOL EH DOES NERO PLAY POOL NOT AS WELL AS HE DOES THE FIDDLE SIR SAID THE JANITOR WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE
474-141422-0002 SHAKESPEARE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND TOSSED UP AN OBOLUS HEADS BACON TAILS POOL WITH NERO AND JOHNSON HE SAID THE COIN CAME DOWN WITH HEADS UP AND SHAKESPEARE WENT INTO THE POOL ROOM
474-141422-0003 JUST TO SHOW THE FATES THAT HE DIDN'T CARE A TUPPENCE FOR THEIR VERDICT AS REGISTERED THROUGH THE OBOLUS IT WAS A PECULIAR CUSTOM OF SHAKESPEARE'S TO TOSS UP A COIN TO DECIDE QUESTIONS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE AND THEN DO THE THING THE COIN DECIDED HE SHOULD NOT DO
474-141422-0004 IT SHOWED IN SHAKESPEARE'S ESTIMATION HIS ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE OF THOSE DULL PERSONS WHO SUPPOSED THAT IN THEM WAS CENTRED THE DESTINY OF ALL MANKIND THE FATES HOWEVER ONLY SMILED AT THESE LITTLE ACTS OF REBELLION
474-141422-0005 AND IT WAS COMMON GOSSIP IN EREBUS THAT ONE OF THE TRIO HAD TOLD THE FURIES THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED SHAKESPEARE'S TENDENCY TO KICK OVER THE TRACES AND ALWAYS ACTED ACCORDINGLY THEY NEVER LET THE COIN FALL SO AS TO DECIDE A QUESTION THE WAY THEY WANTED IT
474-141422-0006 SO THAT UNWITTINGLY THE GREAT DRAMATIST DID THEIR WILL AFTER ALL IT WAS A PART OF THEIR PLAN THAT UPON THIS OCCASION SHAKESPEARE SHOULD PLAY POOL WITH DOCTOR JOHNSON AND THE EMPEROR NERO
474-141422-0007 HULLO WILLIAM SAID THE DOCTOR POCKETING THREE BALLS ON THE BREAK HOW'S OUR LITTLE SWANLET OF AVON THIS AFTERNOON WORN OUT SHAKESPEARE REPLIED I'VE BEEN HARD AT WORK ON A PLAY THIS MORNING AND I'M TIRED
474-141422-0008 ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY SAID NERO GRINNING BROADLY YOU ARE A BRIGHT SPIRIT SAID SHAKESPEARE WITH A SIGH I WISH I HAD THOUGHT TO WORK YOU UP INTO A TRAGEDY I'VE OFTEN WONDERED WHY YOU DIDN'T
474-141422-0009 SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON HE'D HAVE MADE A SUPERB TRAGEDY NERO WOULD I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WAS ANY KIND OF A CRIME HE LEFT UNCOMMITTED WAS THERE EMPEROR YES I NEVER WROTE AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY RETURNED THE EMPEROR DRYLY
474-141422-0010 I'VE MURDERED EVERYTHING BUT ENGLISH THOUGH I COULD HAVE MADE A FINE TRAGEDY OUT OF YOU SAID SHAKESPEARE JUST THINK WHAT A DREADFUL CLIMAX FOR A TRAGEDY IT WOULD BE JOHNSON TO HAVE NERO AS THE CURTAIN FELL PLAYING A VIOLIN SOLO
474-141422-0011 PRETTY GOOD RETURNED THE DOCTOR BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF KILLING OFF YOUR AUDIENCE THAT WAY IT'S BETTER BUSINESS TO LET EM LIVE I SAY SUPPOSE NERO GAVE A LONDON AUDIENCE THAT LITTLE MUSICALE HE PROVIDED AT QUEEN ELIZABETH'S WEDNESDAY NIGHT
474-141422-0012 NOT ONE SAID SHAKESPEARE I WAS MIGHTY GLAD THAT NIGHT THAT WE WERE AN IMMORTAL BAND IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO KILL US WE'D HAVE DIED THEN AND THERE THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID NERO WITH A SIGNIFICANT SHAKE OF HIS HEAD
474-141422-0013 WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY ATTRIBUTING THOSE WORDS TO BACON DEMANDED SHAKESPEARE GETTING RED IN THE FACE OH COME NOW WILLIAM REMONSTRATED NERO
474-141422-0014 IT'S ALL RIGHT TO PULL THE WOOL OVER THE EYES OF THE MORTALS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR BUT AS FOR US WE'RE ALL IN THE SECRET HERE WHAT'S THE USE OF PUTTING ON NONSENSE WITH US WE'LL SEE IN A MINUTE WHAT THE USE IS RETORTED THE AVONIAN WE'LL HAVE BACON DOWN HERE
474-141422-0015 GET SOME ICE FOR THE EMPEROR AND ASK LORD BACON TO STEP DOWN HERE A MINUTE I DON'T WANT ANY ICE SAID NERO NOT NOW RETORTED SHAKESPEARE BUT YOU WILL IN A FEW MINUTES WHEN WE HAVE FINISHED WITH YOU YOU'LL WANT AN ICEBERG
474-141422-0016 I'M GETTING TIRED OF THIS IDIOTIC TALK ABOUT NOT HAVING WRITTEN MY OWN WORKS THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT NERO'S MUSIC THAT I'VE NEVER SAID BECAUSE I HAVEN'T WANTED TO HURT HIS FEELINGS BUT SINCE HE HAS CHOSEN TO CAST ASPERSIONS UPON MY HONESTY I HAVEN'T ANY HESITATION IN SAYING IT NOW
474-141422-0017 I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF HIS FIDDLINGS THAT SENT NATURE INTO CONVULSIONS AND CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII SO THERE PUT THAT ON YOUR MUSIC RACK AND FIDDLE IT MY LITTLE EMPEROR NERO'S FACE GREW PURPLE WITH ANGER
474-141422-0018 FOR THE ENRAGED ROMAN POISING HIS CUE ON HIGH AS THOUGH IT WERE A LANCE HURLED IT AT THE IMPERTINENT DRAMATIST WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH AND WITH SUCH ACCURACY OF AIM WITHAL THAT IT PIERCED THE SPOT BENEATH WHICH IN LIFE THE HEART OF SHAKESPEARE USED TO BEAT
474-141422-0019 GOOD SHOT SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON NONCHALANTLY
474-141422-0020 YOU CAN'T KILL ME SAID SHAKESPEARE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS I KNOW SEVEN DOZEN ACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE TRYING TO DO IT BUT THEY CAN'T
474-141422-0021 I WENT OVER TO BOSTON ONE NIGHT LAST WEEK AND UNKNOWN TO ANYBODY I WAYLAID A FELLOW WHO WAS TO PLAY HAMLET THAT NIGHT I DRUGGED HIM AND WENT TO THE THEATRE AND PLAYED THE PART MYSELF IT WAS THE COLDEST HOUSE YOU EVER SAW IN YOUR LIFE
474-141422-0022 FAVORABLE ASKED THE DOCTOR THEY ALL DISMISSED ME WITH A LINE SAID THE DRAMATIST SAID MY CONCEPTION OF THE PART WAS NOT SHAKESPEARIAN AND THAT'S CRITICISM
474-141422-0023 NO SAID THE SHADE OF EMERSON WHICH HAD STROLLED IN WHILE SHAKESPEARE WAS TALKING THAT ISN'T CRITICISM THAT'S BOSTON WHO DISCOVERED BOSTON ANYHOW ASKED DOCTOR JOHNSON IT WASN'T COLUMBUS WAS IT
474-141422-0024 OH NO SAID EMERSON OLD GOVERNOR WINTHROP IS TO BLAME FOR THAT WHEN HE SETTLED AT CHARLESTOWN HE SAW THE OLD INDIAN TOWN OF SHAWMUT ACROSS THE CHARLES AND SHAWMUT WAS THE BOSTON MICROBE WAS IT ASKED JOHNSON YES

474-141422-0026 I WISH I'D SAID THAT WELL TELL BOSWELL SAID SHAKESPEARE
474-141422-0027 LORD BACON ACCOMPANIED BY CHARON AND THE ICE FOR NERO AND THE ALE FOR DOCTOR JOHNSON APPEARED AS SHAKESPEARE SPOKE THE PHILOSOPHER BOWED STIFFLY AT DOCTOR JOHNSON AS THOUGH HE HARDLY APPROVED OF HIM EXTENDED HIS LEFT HAND TO SHAKESPEARE
474-141422-0028 AND STARED COLDLY AT NERO DID YOU SEND FOR ME WILLIAM HE ASKED LANGUIDLY I DID SAID SHAKESPEARE
474-141422-0029 WHAT NONSENSE SAID BACON THE ONLY PLAYS OF YOURS I WROTE WERE HAM SH SAID SHAKESPEARE SHAKING HIS HEAD MADLY HUSH NOBODY'S SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT THIS IS PURELY A DISCUSSION OF OTHELLO
474-141422-0030 THE FIDDLING EX EMPEROR NERO SAID BACON LOUDLY ENOUGH TO BE HEARD ALL ABOUT THE ROOM IS MISTAKEN WHEN HE ATTRIBUTES OTHELLO TO ME AHA MASTER NERO CRIED SHAKESPEARE TRIUMPHANTLY WHAT DID I TELL YOU
474-141422-0031 THEN I ERRED THAT IS ALL SAID NERO AND I APOLOGIZE BUT REALLY MY LORD HE ADDED ADDRESSING BACON I FANCIED I DETECTED YOUR FINE ITALIAN HAND IN THAT NO I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OTHELLO SAID BACON
474-141422-0032 BACON SMILED AND NODDED APPROVINGLY AT THE BLUSHING AVONIAN
474-141422-0033 HA HA IT WAS THE GREATEST JOKE OF THE CENTURY WELL THE LAUGH IS ON YOU SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON IF YOU WROTE HAMLET AND DIDN'T HAVE THE SENSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT
474-141422-0034 YOU PRESENT TO MY MIND A CLOSER RESEMBLANCE TO SIMPLE SIMON THAN TO SOCRATES FOR MY PART I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DID WRITE IT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT SHAKESPEARE DID I CAN TELL THAT BY THE SPELLING IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION
474-141422-0035 SHAKESPEARE WAS MY STENOGRAPHER GENTLEMEN SAID LORD BACON IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH HE DID WRITE HAMLET LITERALLY BUT IT WAS AT MY DICTATION I DENY IT SAID SHAKESPEARE
474-141422-0036 I ADMIT YOU GAVE ME A SUGGESTION NOW AND THEN SO AS TO KEEP IT DULL AND HEAVY IN SPOTS SO THAT IT WOULD SEEM MORE LIKE A REAL TRAGEDY THAN A COMEDY PUNCTUATED WITH DEATHS BUT BEYOND THAT YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT I SIDE WITH SHAKESPEARE PUT IN EMERSON
474-141422-0037 I'VE SEEN HIS AUTOGRAPHS AND NO SANE PERSON WOULD EMPLOY A MAN WHO WROTE SUCH A VILLANOUSLY BAD HAND AS AN AMANUENSIS IT'S NO USE BACON WE KNOW A THING OR TWO I'M A NEW ENGLANDER I AM
474-141422-0038 WELL SAID BACON SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AS THOUGH THE RESULTS OF THE CONTROVERSY WERE IMMATERIAL TO HIM HAVE IT SO IF YOU PLEASE THERE ISN'T ANY MONEY IN SHAKESPEARE THESE DAYS SO WHAT'S THE USE OF QUARRELLING I WROTE HAMLET
474-141422-0039 AND SHAKESPEARE KNOWS IT OTHERS KNOW IT AH HERE COMES SIR WALTER RALEIGH WE'LL LEAVE IT TO HIM HE WAS COGNIZANT OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR I LEAVE IT TO NOBODY SAID SHAKESPEARE SULKILY WHAT'S THE TROUBLE ASKED RALEIGH
474-141422-0040 SAUNTERING UP AND TAKING A CHAIR UNDER THE CUE RACK TALKING POLITICS NOT WE SAID BACON IT'S THE OLD QUESTION ABOUT THE AUTHORSHIP OF HAMLET WILL AS USUAL CLAIMS IT FOR HIMSELF HE'LL BE SAYING HE WROTE GENESIS NEXT
474-141422-0041 WE ALL KNOW WILL AND HIS DROLL WAYS NO DOUBT PUT IN NERO BUT THE QUESTION OF HAMLET ALWAYS EXCITES HIM SO THAT WE'D LIKE TO HAVE IT SETTLED ONCE AND FOR ALL AS TO WHO WROTE IT BACON SAYS YOU KNOW
