596-139612-0000 LONG LONG AGO THERE LIVED AN OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO SUPPORTED THEMSELVES BY CULTIVATING A SMALL PLOT OF LAND THEIR LIFE HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY AND PEACEFUL ONE SAVE FOR ONE GREAT SORROW AND THIS WAS THEY HAD NO CHILD
596-139612-0001 THEIR ONLY PET WAS A DOG NAMED SHIRO AND ON HIM THEY LAVISHED ALL THE AFFECTION OF THEIR OLD AGE INDEED THEY LOVED HIM SO MUCH THAT WHENEVER THEY HAD ANYTHING NICE TO EAT
596-139612-0002 THEY DENIED THEMSELVES TO GIVE IT TO SHIRO NOW SHIRO MEANS WHITE AND HE WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE OF HIS COLOR HE WAS A REAL JAPANESE DOG AND VERY LIKE A SMALL WOLF IN APPEARANCE
596-139612-0003 THE HAPPIEST HOUR OF THE DAY BOTH FOR THE OLD MAN AND HIS DOG WAS WHEN THE MAN RETURNED FROM HIS WORK IN THE FIELD AND HAVING FINISHED HIS FRUGAL SUPPER OF RICE AND VEGETABLES
596-139612-0004 WOULD TAKE WHAT HE HAD SAVED FROM THE MEAL OUT TO THE LITTLE VERANDA THAT RAN ROUND THE COTTAGE SURE ENOUGH SHIRO WAS WAITING FOR HIS MASTER AND THE EVENING TIT BIT THEN THE OLD MAN SAID CHIN CHIN AND SHIRO SAT UP AND BEGGED
596-139612-0005 AND HIS MASTER GAVE HIM THE FOOD NEXT DOOR TO THIS GOOD OLD COUPLE THERE LIVED ANOTHER OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO WERE BOTH WICKED AND CRUEL AND WHO HATED THEIR GOOD NEIGHBORS AND THE DOG SHIRO WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
596-139612-0006 THEY AT ONCE KICKED HIM OR THREW SOMETHING AT HIM SOMETIMES EVEN WOUNDING HIM ONE DAY SHIRO WAS HEARD BARKING FOR A LONG TIME IN THE FIELD AT THE BACK OF HIS MASTER'S HOUSE
596-139612-0007 THE OLD MAN THINKING THAT PERHAPS SOME BIRDS WERE ATTACKING THE CORN HURRIED OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AS SOON AS SHIRO SAW HIS MASTER HE RAN TO MEET HIM WAGGING HIS TAIL AND SEIZING THE END OF HIS KIMONO
596-139612-0008 DRAGGED HIM UNDER A LARGE YENOKI TREE HERE HE BEGAN TO DIG VERY INDUSTRIOUSLY WITH HIS PAWS YELPING WITH JOY ALL THE TIME THE OLD MAN UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT ALL MEANT STOOD LOOKING ON IN BEWILDERMENT
596-139612-0009 BUT SHIRO WENT ON BARKING AND DIGGING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE HIDDEN BENEATH THE TREE AND THAT THE DOG HAD SCENTED IT AT LAST STRUCK THE OLD MAN HE RAN BACK TO THE HOUSE
596-139612-0010 FETCHED HIS SPADE AND BEGAN TO DIG THE GROUND AT THAT SPOT WHAT WAS HIS ASTONISHMENT WHEN AFTER DIGGING FOR SOME TIME HE CAME UPON A HEAP OF OLD AND VALUABLE COINS AND THE DEEPER HE DUG THE MORE GOLD COINS DID HE FIND
596-139612-0011 SO INTENT WAS THE OLD MAN ON HIS WORK THAT HE NEVER SAW THE CROSS FACE OF HIS NEIGHBOR PEERING AT HIM THROUGH THE BAMBOO HEDGE AT LAST ALL THE GOLD COINS LAY SHINING ON THE GROUND
596-139612-0012 SHIRO SAT BY ERECT WITH PRIDE AND LOOKING FONDLY AT HIS MASTER AS IF TO SAY YOU SEE THOUGH ONLY A DOG I CAN MAKE SOME RETURN FOR ALL THE KINDNESS YOU SHOW ME THE OLD MAN RAN IN TO CALL HIS WIFE
596-139612-0013 IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE THE CROSS OLD NEIGHBOR ATTRACTED BY SHIRO'S BARKING HAD BEEN AN UNSEEN AND ENVIOUS WITNESS OF THE FINDING OF THE TREASURE HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE TOO WOULD LIKE TO FIND A FORTUNE
596-139612-0014 SO A FEW DAYS LATER HE CALLED AT THE OLD MAN'S HOUSE AND VERY CEREMONIOUSLY ASKED PERMISSION TO BORROW SHIRO FOR A SHORT TIME SHIRO'S MASTER THOUGHT THIS A STRANGE REQUEST
596-139612-0015 BUT THAT HE NEVER LOST AN OPPORTUNITY OF STRIKING AND TORMENTING HIM WHENEVER THE DOG CROSSED HIS PATH BUT THE GOOD OLD MAN WAS TOO KIND HEARTED TO REFUSE HIS NEIGHBOR SO HE CONSENTED TO LEND THE DOG
596-139612-0016 ON CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKEN GREAT CARE OF THE WICKED OLD MAN RETURNED TO HIS HOME WITH AN EVIL SMILE ON HIS FACE AND TOLD HIS WIFE HOW HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN HIS CRAFTY INTENTIONS HE THEN TOOK HIS SPADE
596-139612-0017 AND HASTENED TO HIS OWN FIELD FORCING THE UNWILLING SHIRO TO FOLLOW HIM AS SOON AS HE REACHED A YENOKI TREE HE SAID TO THE DOG THREATENINGLY
596-139612-0018 THERE MUST ALSO BE GOLD COINS UNDER MY TREE YOU MUST FIND THEM FOR ME WHERE ARE THEY WHERE WHERE AND CATCHING HOLD OF SHIRO'S NECK HE HELD THE DOG'S HEAD TO THE GROUND
596-139612-0019 SO THAT SHIRO BEGAN TO SCRATCH AND DIG IN ORDER TO FREE HIMSELF FROM THE HORRID OLD MAN'S GRASP
596-139612-0020 THE OLD MAN WAS VERY PLEASED WHEN HE SAW THE DOG BEGIN TO SCRATCH AND DIG FOR HE AT ONCE SUPPOSED THAT SOME GOLD COINS LAY BURIED UNDER HIS TREE AS WELL AS UNDER HIS NEIGHBOR'S AND THAT THE DOG HAD SCENTED THEM AS BEFORE
596-139612-0021 SO PUSHING SHIRO AWAY HE BEGAN TO DIG HIMSELF BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE FOUND AS HE WENT ON DIGGING A FOUL SMELL WAS NOTICEABLE AND HE AT LAST CAME UPON A REFUSE HEAP
596-139612-0022 THE OLD MAN'S DISGUST CAN BE IMAGINED THIS SOON GAVE WAY TO ANGER
596-139612-0023 AND NOW JUST AS HE SEEMED ON THE POINT OF FINDING WHAT HE SOUGHT ONLY A HORRID SMELLING REFUSE HEAP HAD REWARDED HIM FOR A MORNING'S DIGGING INSTEAD OF BLAMING HIS OWN GREED FOR HIS DISAPPOINTMENT HE BLAMED THE POOR DOG
596-139612-0024 HE SEIZED HIS SPADE AND WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH STRUCK SHIRO AND KILLED HIM ON THE SPOT HE THEN THREW THE DOG'S BODY INTO THE HOLE WHICH HE HAD DUG IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A TREASURE OF GOLD COINS AND COVERED IT OVER WITH THE EARTH
596-139612-0025 THEN HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE TELLING NO ONE NOT EVEN HIS WIFE WHAT HE HAD DONE AFTER WAITING SEVERAL DAYS AS THE DOG SHIRO DID NOT RETURN HIS MASTER BEGAN TO GROW ANXIOUS
596-139612-0026 DAY AFTER DAY WENT BY AND THE GOOD OLD MAN WAITED IN VAIN THEN HE WENT TO HIS NEIGHBOR AND ASKED HIM TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS DOG WITHOUT ANY SHAME OR HESITATION
596-139612-0027 THE WICKED NEIGHBOR ANSWERED THAT HE HAD KILLED SHIRO BECAUSE OF HIS BAD BEHAVIOR AT THIS DREADFUL NEWS SHIRO'S MASTER WEPT MANY SAD AND BITTER TEARS GREAT INDEED WAS HIS WOFUL SURPRISE
596-139612-0028 EVEN THE CROSS OLD NEIGHBOR COULD NOT REFUSE SUCH A SIMPLE REQUEST SO HE CONSENTED TO GIVE THE OLD MAN THE TREE UNDER WHICH SHIRO LAY BURIED SHIRO'S MASTER THEN CUT THE TREE DOWN AND CARRIED IT HOME OUT OF THE TRUNK HE MADE A MORTAR
596-139612-0029 IN THIS HIS WIFE PUT SOME RICE AND HE BEGAN TO POUND IT WITH THE INTENTION OF MAKING A FESTIVAL TO THE MEMORY OF HIS DOG SHIRO A STRANGE THING HAPPENED HIS WIFE PUT THE RICE INTO THE MORTAR
596-139612-0030 AND NO SOONER HAD HE BEGUN TO POUND IT TO MAKE THE CAKES THAN IT BEGAN TO INCREASE IN QUANTITY GRADUALLY TILL IT WAS ABOUT FIVE TIMES THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT AND THE CAKES WERE TURNED OUT OF THE MORTAR
596-139612-0031 AS IF AN INVISIBLE HAND WERE AT WORK WHEN THE OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE SAW THIS THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS A REWARD TO THEM FROM SHIRO FOR THEIR FAITHFUL LOVE TO HIM THEY TASTED THE CAKES
596-139612-0032 AND FOUND THEM NICER THAN ANY OTHER FOOD SO FROM THIS TIME THEY NEVER TROUBLED ABOUT FOOD FOR THEY LIVED UPON THE CAKES WITH WHICH THE MORTAR NEVER CEASED TO SUPPLY THEM THE GREEDY NEIGHBOR HEARING OF THIS NEW PIECE OF GOOD LUCK
596-139612-0033 WAS FILLED WITH ENVY AS BEFORE AND CALLED ON THE OLD MAN AND ASKED LEAVE TO BORROW THE WONDERFUL MORTAR FOR A SHORT TIME PRETENDING THAT HE TOO SORROWED FOR THE DEATH OF SHIRO AND WISHED TO MAKE CAKES FOR A FESTIVAL TO THE DOG'S MEMORY
596-139612-0034 THE OLD MAN DID NOT IN THE LEAST WISH TO LEND IT TO HIS CRUEL NEIGHBOR BUT HE WAS TOO KIND TO REFUSE SO THE ENVIOUS MAN CARRIED HOME THE MORTAR BUT HE NEVER BROUGHT IT BACK SEVERAL DAYS PASSED
596-139612-0035 ON THE GROUND LAY WHAT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE PIECES OF A BROKEN MORTAR IN ANSWER TO THE OLD MAN'S INQUIRY THE WICKED NEIGHBOR ANSWERED HAUGHTILY HAVE YOU COME TO ASK ME FOR YOUR MORTAR
596-139612-0036 I BROKE IT TO PIECES AND NOW I AM MAKING A FIRE OF THE WOOD FOR WHEN I TRIED TO POUND CAKES IN IT ONLY SOME HORRID SMELLING STUFF CAME OUT THE GOOD OLD MAN SAID I AM VERY SORRY FOR THAT
596-139612-0037 AND THE OLD MAN CARRIED HOME A BASKET FULL OF ASHES NOT LONG AFTER THIS THE OLD MAN ACCIDENTALLY SCATTERED SOME OF THE ASHES MADE BY THE BURNING OF THE MORTAR ON THE TREES OF HIS GARDEN A WONDERFUL THING HAPPENED
596-139612-0038 IT WAS LATE IN AUTUMN AND ALL THE TREES HAD SHED THEIR LEAVES BUT NO SOONER DID THE ASHES TOUCH THEIR BRANCHES THAN THE CHERRY TREES THE PLUM TREES AND ALL OTHER BLOSSOMING SHRUBS
596-139612-0039 BURST INTO BLOOM SO THAT THE OLD MAN'S GARDEN WAS SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED INTO A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF SPRING THE OLD MAN'S DELIGHT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND HE CAREFULLY PRESERVED THE REMAINING ASHES
596-139612-0040 THE STORY OF THE OLD MAN'S GARDEN SPREAD FAR AND WIDE AND PEOPLE FROM FAR AND NEAR CAME TO SEE THE WONDERFUL SIGHT ONE DAY SOON AFTER THIS THE OLD MAN HEARD SOME ONE KNOCKING AT HIS DOOR
596-139612-0041 THAT ONE OF THE FAVORITE CHERRY TREES IN THIS NOBLEMAN'S GARDEN HAD WITHERED
596-139612-0042 NONE TOOK EFFECT THE KNIGHT WAS SORE PERPLEXED WHEN HE SAW WHAT GREAT DISPLEASURE THE LOSS OF HIS FAVORITE CHERRY TREE CAUSED THE DAIMIO AT THIS POINT FORTUNATELY
596-139612-0043 THEY HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS A WONDERFUL OLD MAN WHO COULD MAKE WITHERED TREES TO BLOSSOM AND THAT HIS LORD HAD SENT HIM TO ASK THE OLD MAN TO COME TO HIM AND ADDED THE KNIGHT I SHALL BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WILL COME AT ONCE
596-139612-0044 THE GOOD OLD MAN WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT WHAT HE HEARD BUT RESPECTFULLY FOLLOWED THE KNIGHT TO THE NOBLEMAN'S PALACE THE DAIMIO WHO HAD BEEN IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE OLD MAN'S COMING AS SOON AS HE SAW HIM ASKED HIM AT ONCE
596-139612-0045 ARE YOU THE OLD MAN WHO CAN MAKE WITHERED TREES FLOWER EVEN OUT OF SEASON THE OLD MAN MADE AN OBEISANCE AND REPLIED I AM THAT OLD MAN THEN THE DAIMIO SAID
596-139612-0046 YOU MUST MAKE THAT DEAD CHERRY TREE IN MY GARDEN BLOSSOM AGAIN BY MEANS OF YOUR FAMOUS ASHES I SHALL LOOK ON THEN THEY ALL WENT INTO THE GARDEN THE DAIMIO AND HIS RETAINERS AND THE LADIES IN WAITING WHO CARRIED THE DAIMIO'S SWORD
596-139612-0047 EXCUSE ME HE TOOK THE POT OF ASHES WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND BEGAN TO CLIMB THE TREE EVERY ONE WATCHING HIS MOVEMENTS WITH GREAT INTEREST AT LAST HE CLIMBED TO THE SPOT WHERE THE TREE DIVIDED INTO TWO GREAT BRANCHES
596-139612-0048 AND TAKING UP HIS POSITION HERE THE OLD MAN SAT DOWN AND SCATTERED THE ASHES RIGHT AND LEFT ALL OVER THE BRANCHES AND TWIGS WONDERFUL INDEED WAS THE RESULT
596-139612-0049 AND OF ALL THAT HAD SO AUSPICIOUSLY BEFALLEN HIM AND HE COULD NOT SUPPRESS ALL THE ENVY AND JEALOUSY THAT FILLED HIS HEART HE CALLED TO MIND HOW HE HAD FAILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO FIND THE GOLD COINS AND THEN IN MAKING THE MAGIC CAKES
596-139612-0050 SO HE SET TO WORK AND GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE ASHES WHICH REMAINED IN THE FIRE PLACE FROM THE BURNING OF THE WONDERFUL MORTAR THEN HE SET OUT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SOME GREAT MAN TO EMPLOY HIM
596-139612-0051 IT WILL AMUSE ME TO LOOK ON SO THE RETAINERS WENT OUT AND BROUGHT IN THE IMPOSTOR BEFORE THEIR LORD
596-139612-0052 BUT THE DAIMIO LOOKING AT HIM THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THE OLD MAN HE HAD SEEN BEFORE SO HE ASKED HIM ARE YOU THE MAN WHOM I NAMED HANA SAKA JIJII AND THE ENVIOUS NEIGHBOR ANSWERED WITH A LIE YES MY LORD
596-139612-0053 TRY WHAT YOU CAN DO AND LET ME SEE THE ENVIOUS NEIGHBOR WITH THE DAIMIO AND HIS COURT FOLLOWING THEN WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND APPROACHING A DEAD TREE TOOK OUT A HANDFUL OF THE ASHES WHICH HE CARRIED WITH HIM
596-139612-0054 AND SCATTERED THEM OVER THE TREE BUT NOT ONLY DID THE TREE NOT BURST INTO FLOWER
596-139612-0055 THINKING THAT HE HAD NOT USED ENOUGH ASHES THE OLD MAN TOOK HANDFULS AND AGAIN SPRINKLED THEM OVER THE WITHERED TREE BUT ALL TO NO EFFECT AFTER TRYING SEVERAL TIMES THE ASHES WERE BLOWN INTO THE DAIMIO'S EYES
596-139612-0056 THIS MADE HIM VERY ANGRY AND HE ORDERED HIS RETAINERS TO ARREST THE FALSE HANA SAKA JIJII AT ONCE AND PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR AN IMPOSTOR FROM THIS IMPRISONMENT THE WICKED OLD MAN WAS NEVER FREED
