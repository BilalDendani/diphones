8897-294717-0000 THE PHYSICIAN'S OPINION SIX MONTHS HAVE ELAPSED SUMMER TIME HAS COME AGAIN THE LAST PARTING IS OVER PROLONGED BY MY CARE THE DAYS OF MY MOTHER'S LIFE HAVE COME TO THEIR END
8897-294717-0001 SHE HAS DIED IN MY ARMS HER LAST WORDS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN TO ME HER LAST LOOK ON EARTH HAS BEEN MINE I AM NOW IN THE SADDEST AND PLAINEST MEANING OF THE WORDS ALONE IN THE WORLD
8897-294717-0002 HAS LEFT CERTAIN DUTIES TO BE PERFORMED THAT REQUIRE MY PRESENCE IN LONDON MY HOUSE IS LET I AM STAYING AT A HOTEL MY FRIEND SIR JAMES
8897-294717-0003 WE BREAKFAST AND DINE TOGETHER IN MY SITTING ROOM FOR THE MOMENT SOLITUDE IS DREADFUL TO ME AND YET I CANNOT GO INTO SOCIETY I SHRINK FROM PERSONS WHO ARE MERE ACQUAINTANCES
8897-294717-0004 AT SIR JAMES'S SUGGESTION HOWEVER ONE VISITOR AT THE HOTEL HAS BEEN ASKED TO DINE WITH US WHO CLAIMS DISTINCTION AS NO ORDINARY GUEST THE PHYSICIAN WHO FIRST WARNED ME OF THE CRITICAL STATE OF MY MOTHER'S HEALTH
8897-294717-0005 IS ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHAT I CAN TELL HIM OF HER LAST MOMENTS HIS TIME IS TOO PRECIOUS TO BE WASTED IN THE EARLIER HOURS OF THE DAY
8897-294717-0006 AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN HIS PATIENTS LEAVE HIM FREE TO VISIT HIS FRIENDS THE DINNER IS NEARLY AT AN END
8897-294717-0007 AND IN FEW WORDS HAVE TOLD THE SIMPLE STORY OF MY MOTHER'S LAST PEACEFUL DAYS ON EARTH THE CONVERSATION TURNS NEXT ON TOPICS OF LITTLE INTEREST TO ME MY MIND RESTS
8897-294717-0008 AFTER THE EFFORT THAT IT HAS MADE MY OBSERVATION IS LEFT FREE TO EXERT ITSELF AS USUAL LITTLE BY LITTLE WHILE THE TALK GOES ON
8897-294717-0009 I OBSERVE SOMETHING IN THE CONDUCT OF THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN WHICH FIRST PUZZLES ME AND THEN AROUSES MY SUSPICION OF SOME MOTIVE FOR HIS PRESENCE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED AND IN WHICH I AM CONCERNED
8897-294717-0010 OVER AND OVER AGAIN
8897-294717-0011 AND ATTENTION WHICH HE SEEMS ANXIOUS TO CONCEAL OVER AND OVER AGAIN
8897-294717-0012 AND TO LURE ME INTO TALKING OF MYSELF AND STRANGER STILL UNLESS I AM QUITE MISTAKEN SIR JAMES UNDERSTANDS AND ENCOURAGES HIM
8897-294717-0013 UNDER VARIOUS PRETENSES I AM QUESTIONED ABOUT WHAT I HAVE SUFFERED IN THE PAST AND WHAT PLANS OF LIFE I HAVE FORMED FOR THE FUTURE AMONG OTHER SUBJECTS OF PERSONAL INTEREST TO ME
8897-294717-0014 I AM DEXTEROUSLY LED INTO HINTING THAT MY VIEWS ON THIS DIFFICULT AND DEBATABLE QUESTION ARE IN SOME DEGREE INFLUENCED BY EXPERIENCES OF MY OWN HINTS HOWEVER
8897-294717-0015 ARE NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE DOCTOR'S INNOCENT CURIOSITY HE TRIES TO INDUCE ME TO RELATE IN DETAIL WHAT I HAVE MYSELF SEEN AND FELT
8897-294717-0016 BUT BY THIS TIME I AM ON MY GUARD I MAKE EXCUSES I STEADILY ABSTAIN FROM TAKING MY FRIEND INTO MY CONFIDENCE IT IS MORE AND MORE PLAIN TO ME THAT I
8897-294717-0017 AM BEING MADE THE SUBJECT OF AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH SIR JAMES AND THE PHYSICIAN ARE EQUALLY INTERESTED OUTWARDLY ASSUMING TO BE GUILTLESS OF ANY SUSPICION OF WHAT IS GOING ON
8897-294717-0018 I INWARDLY DETERMINE TO DISCOVER THE TRUE MOTIVE FOR THE DOCTOR'S PRESENCE THAT EVENING AND FOR THE PART THAT SIR JAMES HAS TAKEN IN INVITING HIM TO BE MY GUEST
8897-294717-0019 EVENTS FAVOR MY PURPOSE SOON AFTER THE DESSERT HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE TABLE
8897-294717-0020 ANNOUNCING THE COMPLETION OF SOME FORMAL MATTER OF BUSINESS I AT ONCE SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IS OFFERED TO ME INSTEAD OF SENDING A VERBAL MESSAGE DOWNSTAIRS I MAKE MY APOLOGIES
8897-294717-0021 AND USE THE LETTER AS A PRETEXT FOR LEAVING THE ROOM DISMISSING THE MESSENGER WHO WAITS BELOW I RETURN TO THE CORRIDOR IN WHICH MY ROOMS ARE SITUATED AND SOFTLY OPEN THE DOOR OF MY BED CHAMBER
8897-294717-0022 A SECOND DOOR COMMUNICATES WITH THE SITTING ROOM AND HAS A VENTILATOR IN THE UPPER PART OF IT I HAVE ONLY TO STAND UNDER THE VENTILATOR AND EVERY WORD OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN SIR JAMES AND THE PHYSICIAN REACHES MY EARS
8897-294717-0023 ARE THE FIRST WORDS I HEAR IN SIR JAMES'S VOICE QUITE RIGHT THE DOCTOR ANSWERS I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE HIM CHANGE HIS DULL WAY OF LIFE SIR JAMES PROCEEDS
8897-294717-0024 I HAVE ASKED HIM TO PAY A VISIT TO MY HOUSE IN SCOTLAND I HAVE PROPOSED TRAVELING WITH HIM ON THE CONTINENT I HAVE OFFERED TO TAKE HIM WITH ME ON MY NEXT VOYAGE IN THE YACHT HE HAS BUT ONE ANSWER
8897-294717-0025 HE SIMPLY SAYS NO TO EVERYTHING THAT I CAN SUGGEST YOU HAVE HEARD FROM HIS OWN LIPS THAT HE HAS NO DEFINITE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE WHAT IS TO BECOME OF HIM WHAT HAD WE BETTER DO
8897-294717-0026 IT IS NOT EASY TO SAY I HEAR THE PHYSICIAN REPLY TO SPEAK PLAINLY
8897-294717-0027 I NOTICED SOMETHING STRANGE IN HIM
8897-294717-0028 THE MISCHIEF HAS NOT BEEN CAUSED ENTIRELY BY THE AFFLICTION OF HER DEATH IN MY BELIEF
8897-294717-0029 FOR SOME TIME PAST HE IS A VERY RESERVED PERSON I SUSPECT HE HAS BEEN OPPRESSED BY ANXIETIES
8897-294717-0030 THE UNACKNOWLEDGED TROUBLES OF LIFE ARE GENERALLY
8897-294717-0031 TO TAKE THE ROMANTIC VIEW OF LOVE AND SOME MATTER OF FACT WOMAN OF THE PRESENT DAY MAY HAVE BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED HIM WHATEVER MAY BE THE CAUSE THE EFFECT IS PLAIN HIS NERVES HAVE BROKEN DOWN AND
8897-294717-0032 I HAVE KNOWN MEN IN HIS CONDITION WHO HAVE ENDED BADLY
8897-294717-0033 IF HIS PRESENT COURSE OF LIFE IS NOT ALTERED
8897-294717-0034 SIR JAMES REMARKS SHEER DELUSION WOULD BE THE MORE CORRECT FORM OF EXPRESSION THE DOCTOR REJOINS AND OTHER DELUSIONS MAY GROW OUT OF IT AT ANY MOMENT
8897-294717-0035 I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK THE CASE IS BAD ENOUGH TO BE A CASE FOR RESTRAINT CERTAINLY NOT AS YET ANSWERS THE DOCTOR SO FAR THERE IS NO POSITIVE BRAIN DISEASE
8897-294717-0036 AND THERE IS ACCORDINGLY NO SORT OF REASON FOR PLACING HIM UNDER RESTRAINT IT IS ESSENTIALLY A DIFFICULT AND A DOUBTFUL CASE HAVE HIM PRIVATELY LOOKED AFTER BY A COMPETENT PERSON AND THWART HIM IN NOTHING
8897-294717-0037 IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY HELP IT THE MEREST TRIFLE MAY EXCITE HIS SUSPICIONS AND IF THAT HAPPENS
8897-294717-0038 CONTROL OVER HIM YOU DON'T THINK HE SUSPECTS US ALREADY DO YOU DOCTOR
8897-294717-0039 I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE LOOK AT ME VERY STRANGELY AND HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A LONG TIME OUT OF THE ROOM HEARING THIS I WAIT TO HEAR NO MORE I RETURN TO THE SITTING ROOM BY WAY OF THE CORRIDOR
8897-294717-0040 AND RESUME MY PLACE AT THE TABLE THE INDIGNATION THAT I FEEL NATURALLY ENOUGH I THINK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MAKES A GOOD ACTOR OF ME FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE
8897-294717-0041 I INVENT THE NECESSARY EXCUSE FOR MY LONG ABSENCE AND TAKE MY PART IN THE CONVERSATION KEEPING THE STRICTEST GUARD ON EVERY WORD THAT ESCAPES ME WITHOUT BETRAYING
8897-294717-0042 ANY APPEARANCE OF RESTRAINT IN MY MANNER EARLY IN THE EVENING THE DOCTOR LEAVES US TO GO TO A SCIENTIFIC MEETING FOR HALF AN HOUR OR MORE SIR JAMES REMAINS WITH ME
8897-294717-0043 OF FARTHER TESTING THE STATE OF MY MIND HE RENEWS THE INVITATION TO HIS HOUSE IN SCOTLAND I PRETEND TO FEEL FLATTERED BY HIS ANXIETY TO SECURE ME AS HIS GUEST
8897-294717-0044 WE SHAKE HANDS CORDIALLY AND WISH EACH OTHER GOOD NIGHT AT LAST I AM LEFT ALONE MY RESOLUTION AS TO MY NEXT COURSE OF PROCEEDING IS FORMED WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION
8897-294717-0045 I DETERMINE TO LEAVE THE HOTEL PRIVATELY THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE SIR JAMES IS OUT OF HIS BEDROOM TO WHAT DESTINATION I AM TO BETAKE MYSELF IS NATURALLY THE NEXT QUESTION THAT ARISES AND THIS
8897-294717-0046 DURING THE LAST DAYS OF MY MOTHER'S LIFE WE SPOKE TOGETHER FREQUENTLY OF THE HAPPY PAST DAYS WHEN WE WERE LIVING TOGETHER ON THE BANKS OF THE GREENWATER LAKE THE LONGING
8897-294717-0047 THUS INSPIRED TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT THE OLD SCENES TO LIVE FOR A WHILE AGAIN AMONG THE OLD ASSOCIATIONS HAS GROWN ON ME SINCE MY MOTHER'S DEATH I HAVE HAPPILY FOR MYSELF
8897-294717-0048 I RESOLVE TO GO THE NEXT MORNING WANDERING AMONG THE SCENES OF MY BOYHOOD I CAN CONSIDER WITH MYSELF HOW I MAY BEST BEAR THE BURDEN
8897-294717-0049 OF THE LIFE THAT LIES BEFORE ME AFTER WHAT I HAVE HEARD THAT EVENING I CONFIDE IN NOBODY
8897-294717-0050 MY OWN SERVANT MAY BE EMPLOYED TO MORROW AS THE SPY WHO WATCHES MY ACTIONS WHEN THE MAN MAKES HIS APPEARANCE TO TAKE HIS ORDERS FOR THE NIGHT I TELL HIM TO WAKE ME AT SIX THE NEXT MORNING
8897-294717-0051 AND RELEASE HIM FROM FURTHER ATTENDANCE I NEXT EMPLOY MYSELF IN WRITING TWO LETTERS THEY WILL BE LEFT ON THE TABLE TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AFTER MY DEPARTURE IN THE FIRST LETTER
8897-294717-0052 I BRIEFLY INFORM SIR JAMES THAT I HAVE DISCOVERED HIS TRUE REASON FOR INVITING THE DOCTOR TO DINNER WHILE I THANK HIM FOR THE INTEREST HE TAKES IN MY WELFARE
8897-294717-0053 I DECLINE TO BE MADE THE OBJECT OF ANY FURTHER MEDICAL INQUIRIES AS TO THE STATE OF MY MIND IN DUE COURSE OF TIME WHEN MY PLANS ARE SETTLED HE WILL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN MEANWHILE
8897-294717-0054 HE NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ABOUT MY SAFETY
8897-294717-0055 MY SECOND LETTER IS ADDRESSED TO THE LANDLORD OF THE HOTEL AND SIMPLY PROVIDES FOR THE DISPOSAL OF MY LUGGAGE AND THE PAYMENT OF MY BILL I ENTER MY BEDROOM NEXT
8897-294717-0056 AND PACK A TRAVELING BAG WITH THE FEW THINGS THAT I CAN CARRY WITH ME MY MONEY IS IN MY DRESSING CASE OPENING IT I DISCOVER MY PRETTY KEEPSAKE THE GREEN FLAG CAN I RETURN TO GREENWATER BROAD
8897-294717-0057 CAN I LOOK AGAIN AT THE BAILIFF'S COTTAGE WITHOUT THE ONE MEMORIAL OF LITTLE MARY THAT I POSSESS BESIDES HAVE I NOT PROMISED MISS DUNROSS THAT MARY'S GIFT SHALL ALWAYS GO WITH ME WHEREVER I GO
8897-294717-0058 AND IS THE PROMISE NOT DOUBLY SACRED NOW THAT SHE IS DEAD FOR A WHILE I SIT IDLY LOOKING AT THE DEVICE ON THE FLAG THE WHITE DOVE EMBROIDERED ON THE GREEN GROUND
8897-294717-0059 I LIE DOWN ON MY BED AND I DISCOVER THAT THERE IS NO REST FOR ME THAT NIGHT NOW THAT I HAVE NO OCCUPATION TO KEEP MY ENERGIES EMPLOYED NOW THAT MY FIRST SENSE OF TRIUMPH
8897-294717-0060 IN THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE FRIENDS WHO HAVE PLOTTED AGAINST ME HAS HAD TIME TO SUBSIDE MY MIND REVERTS TO THE CONVERSATION THAT I HAVE OVERHEARD AND CONSIDERS IT
8897-294717-0061 THE TERRIBLE QUESTION CONFRONTS ME THE DOCTOR'S OPINION ON MY CASE HAS BEEN GIVEN VERY POSITIVELY HOW DO I KNOW
8897-294717-0062 THIS FAMOUS PHYSICIAN HAS RISEN TO THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION ENTIRELY BY HIS OWN ABILITIES HE IS ONE OF THE MEDICAL MEN WHO SUCCEED BY MEANS OF AN INGRATIATING MANNER
8897-294717-0063 AND THE DEXTEROUS HANDLING OF GOOD OPPORTUNITIES EVEN HIS ENEMIES ADMIT THAT HE STANDS UNRIVALED IN THE ART OF SEPARATING THE TRUE CONDITIONS FROM THE FALSE IN THE DISCOVERY OF DISEASE
8897-294717-0064 AND IN TRACING EFFECTS ACCURATELY TO THEIR DISTANT AND HIDDEN CAUSE
8897-294717-0065 LIKELY TO BE MISTAKEN ABOUT ME IS IT NOT FAR MORE PROBABLE THAT I AM MISTAKEN IN MY JUDGMENT OF MYSELF
8897-294717-0066 REALITIES TO ME AND TO NO ONE ELSE WHAT ARE THE DREAMS OF MISSUS VAN BRANDT WHAT ARE THE GHOSTLY APPARITIONS OF HER WHICH I BELIEVE MYSELF TO HAVE SEEN
8897-294717-0067 DELUSIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN THE STEALTHY GROWTH OF YEARS DELUSIONS WHICH ARE LEADING ME BY SLOW DEGREES NEARER AND NEARER TO MADNESS IN THE END
8897-294717-0068 IS IT INSANE SUSPICION WHICH HAS MADE ME SO ANGRY WITH THE GOOD FRIENDS WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE MY REASON IS IT INSANE TERROR WHICH SETS ME ON ESCAPING
8897-294717-0069 I RISE AND DRESS MYSELF AND WAIT FOR THE DAYLIGHT LOOKING THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW INTO THE STREET THE SUMMER NIGHT IS SHORT THE GRAY LIGHT OF DAWN
8897-294717-0070 COMES TO ME LIKE A DELIVERANCE THE GLOW OF THE GLORIOUS SUNRISE CHEERS MY SOUL ONCE MORE WHY SHOULD I WAIT IN THE ROOM THAT IS STILL HAUNTED BY MY HORRIBLE DOUBTS OF THE NIGHT
8897-294717-0071 I TAKE UP MY TRAVELING BAG I LEAVE MY LETTERS ON THE SITTING ROOM TABLE AND I DESCEND THE STAIRS TO THE HOUSE DOOR
8897-294717-0072 THE NIGHT PORTER AT THE HOTEL IS SLUMBERING IN HIS CHAIR HE WAKES AS I PASS HIM AND GOD HELP ME HE TOO LOOKS AS IF HE THOUGHT
8897-294717-0073 I WAS MAD GOING TO LEAVE US ALREADY SIR HE SAYS LOOKING AT THE BAG IN MY HAND MAD OR SANE I AM READY WITH MY REPLY I TELL HIM I AM
8897-294717-0074 I DECLINE TO LET ANYBODY BE DISTURBED HE INQUIRES IF I HAVE ANY MESSAGES TO LEAVE FOR MY FRIEND I INFORM HIM THAT I HAVE LEFT WRITTEN MESSAGES UPSTAIRS FOR
8897-294717-0075 SIR JAMES AND THE LANDLORD UPON THIS HE DRAWS THE BOLTS AND OPENS THE DOOR TO THE LAST HE LOOKS AT ME
8897-294717-0076 AS IF HE THOUGHT I WAS MAD WAS HE RIGHT OR WRONG WHO CAN ANSWER FOR HIMSELF HOW
