7553-101289-0000 LONG LONG AGO THERE WAS BORN TO A ROMAN KNIGHT AND HIS WIFE MAJA A LITTLE BOY CALLED VIRGILIUS WHILE HE WAS STILL QUITE LITTLE HIS FATHER DIED AND THE KINSMEN
7553-101289-0001 INSTEAD OF BEING A HELP AND PROTECTION TO THE CHILD AND HIS MOTHER ROBBED THEM OF THEIR LANDS AND MONEY AND THE WIDOW FEARING THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE THE BOY'S LIFE ALSO SENT HIM AWAY TO SPAIN THAT HE MIGHT STUDY IN THE GREAT UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO
7553-101289-0002 VIRGILIUS WAS FOND OF BOOKS AND PORED OVER THEM ALL DAY LONG BUT ONE AFTERNOON WHEN THE BOYS WERE GIVEN A HOLIDAY HE TOOK A LONG WALK AND FOUND HIMSELF IN A PLACE WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE
7553-101289-0003 IN FRONT OF HIM WAS A CAVE AND AS NO BOY EVER SEES A CAVE WITHOUT ENTERING IT HE WENT IN THE CAVE WAS SO DEEP THAT IT SEEMED TO VIRGILIUS AS IF IT MUST RUN FAR INTO THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN
7553-101289-0004 AND HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF IT CAME OUT ANYWHERE ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR SOME TIME HE WALKED ON IN PITCH DARKNESS BUT HE WENT STEADILY ON AND BY AND BY A GLIMMER OF LIGHT SHOT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
7553-101289-0005 ANSWERED THE VOICE DO YOU MARK UPON THE GROUND WHERE YOU ARE STANDING A SLIDE OR BOLT I DO REPLIED VIRGILIUS THEN SAID THE VOICE
7553-101289-0006 BUT WHO ARE YOU ASKED VIRGILIUS WHO NEVER DID ANYTHING IN A HURRY
7553-101289-0007 SAID THE VOICE SHUT UP HERE TILL
7553-101289-0008 BUT IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR WHEN AT LAST HE STOOD UPON THE GROUND HE PROVED TO BE ABOUT THREE TIMES AS LARGE AS VIRGILIUS HIMSELF AND COAL BLACK BESIDES WHY
7553-101289-0009 YOU CAN'T HAVE BEEN AS BIG AS THAT WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HOLE CRIED VIRGILIUS BUT I WAS REPLIED THE SPIRIT I DON'T BELIEVE IT ANSWERED VIRGILIUS
7553-101289-0010 SAID THE SPIRIT AND AFTER TURNING AND TWISTING AND CURLING HIMSELF UP
7553-101289-0011 THEN VIRGILIUS DREW THE BOLT
7553-101289-0012 HE LEFT THE CAVE FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS VIRGILIUS HARDLY ATE OR SLEPT SO BUSY WAS HE IN LEARNING THE MAGIC THE BOOKS CONTAINED BUT AT THE END OF THAT TIME A MESSENGER FROM HIS MOTHER ARRIVED IN TOLEDO
7553-101289-0013 BEGGING HIM TO COME AT ONCE TO ROME AS SHE HAD BEEN ILL AND COULD LOOK AFTER THEIR AFFAIRS NO LONGER THOUGH SORRY TO LEAVE TOLEDO WHERE HE WAS MUCH THOUGHT OF AS SHOWING PROMISE OF GREAT LEARNING VIRGILIUS WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE SET OUT AT ONCE
7553-101289-0014 BUT THERE WERE MANY THINGS HE HAD FIRST TO SEE TO SO HE ENTRUSTED TO THE MESSENGER FOUR PACK HORSES LADEN WITH PRECIOUS THINGS AND A WHITE PALFREY ON WHICH SHE WAS TO RIDE OUT EVERY DAY THEN HE SET ABOUT HIS OWN PREPARATIONS
7553-101289-0015 AND FOLLOWED BY A LARGE TRAIN OF SCHOLARS HE AT LENGTH STARTED FOR ROME FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN ABSENT TWELVE YEARS HIS MOTHER WELCOMED HIM BACK WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AND HIS POOR KINSMEN PRESSED ROUND HIM
7553-101289-0016 AND EVERYONE WHO OWNED LAND WAS BOUND TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE EMPEROR LIKE THE REST VIRGILIUS WENT TO COURT AND DEMANDED JUSTICE FROM THE EMPEROR AGAINST THE MEN WHO HAD ROBBED HIM BUT AS THESE WERE KINSMEN TO THE EMPEROR HE GAINED NOTHING
7553-101289-0017 AS THE EMPEROR TOLD HIM HE WOULD THINK OVER THE MATTER FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS AND THEN GIVE JUDGMENT THIS REPLY NATURALLY DID NOT SATISFY VIRGILIUS AND TURNING ON HIS HEEL HE WENT BACK TO HIS OWN HOME AND GATHERING IN HIS HARVEST
7553-101289-0018 HE STORED IT UP IN HIS VARIOUS HOUSES WHEN THE ENEMIES OF VIRGILIUS HEARD OF THIS THEY ASSEMBLED TOGETHER AND LAID SIEGE TO HIS CASTLE BUT VIRGILIUS WAS A MATCH FOR THEM COMING FORTH FROM THE CASTLE
7553-101289-0019 SO AS TO MEET THEM FACE TO FACE HE CAST A SPELL OVER THEM OF SUCH POWER THAT THEY COULD NOT MOVE AND THEN BADE THEM DEFIANCE AFTER WHICH HE LIFTED THE SPELL AND THE INVADING ARMY SLUNK BACK TO ROME
7553-101289-0020 AND REPORTED WHAT VIRGILIUS HAD SAID TO THE EMPEROR NOW THE EMPEROR WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE HIS LIGHTEST WORD OBEYED ALMOST BEFORE IT WAS UTTERED AND HE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO BELIEVE HIS EARS BUT HE GOT TOGETHER ANOTHER ARMY
7553-101289-0021 AND MARCHED STRAIGHT OFF TO THE CASTLE BUT DIRECTLY THEY TOOK UP THEIR POSITION VIRGILIUS GIRDED THEM ABOUT WITH A GREAT RIVER SO THAT THEY COULD NEITHER MOVE HAND NOR FOOT THEN HAILING THE EMPEROR HE OFFERED HIM PEACE AND ASKED FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP
7553-101289-0022 SO VIRGILIUS WHOSE PATIENCE WAS EXHAUSTED FEASTED HIS OWN FOLLOWERS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE STARVING HOST WHO COULD NOT STIR HAND OR FOOT THINGS SEEMED GETTING DESPERATE WHEN A MAGICIAN ARRIVED IN THE CAMP
7553-101289-0023 AND OFFERED TO SELL HIS SERVICES TO THE EMPEROR HIS PROPOSALS WERE GLADLY ACCEPTED AND IN A MOMENT THE WHOLE OF THE GARRISON SANK DOWN AS IF THEY WERE DEAD AND VIRGILIUS HIMSELF HAD MUCH ADO TO KEEP AWAKE
7553-101289-0024 HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIGHT THE MAGICIAN BUT WITH A GREAT EFFORT STRUGGLED TO OPEN HIS BLACK BOOK WHICH TOLD HIM WHAT SPELLS TO USE IN AN INSTANT ALL HIS FOES SEEMED TURNED TO STONE
7553-101289-0025 ALL DAY THEY STAYED THERE LIKE FLIES UPON THE WALL BUT DURING THE NIGHT VIRGILIUS STOLE SOFTLY TO THE EMPEROR AND OFFERED HIM HIS FREEDOM AS LONG AS HE WOULD DO HIM JUSTICE THE EMPEROR
7553-101289-0026 WHO BY THIS TIME WAS THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENED SAID HE WOULD AGREE TO ANYTHING VIRGILIUS DESIRED SO VIRGILIUS TOOK OFF HIS SPELLS AND AFTER FEASTING THE ARMY AND BESTOWING ON EVERY MAN A GIFT BADE THEM RETURN TO ROME
7553-101289-0027 AND MORE THAN THAT HE BUILT A SQUARE TOWER FOR THE EMPEROR AND IN EACH CORNER ALL THAT WAS SAID IN THAT QUARTER OF THE CITY MIGHT BE HEARD WHILE IF YOU STOOD IN THE CENTRE EVERY WHISPER THROUGHOUT ROME WOULD REACH YOUR EARS
7553-101289-0028 HAVING SETTLED HIS AFFAIRS WITH THE EMPEROR AND HIS ENEMIES VIRGILIUS HAD TIME TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS AND HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO FALL IN LOVE
7553-101289-0029 AND HER FACE FAIRER THAN ANY IN ROME BUT SHE ONLY MOCKED VIRGILIUS AND WAS ALWAYS PLAYING TRICKS UPON HIM TO THIS END SHE BADE HIM ONE DAY COME TO VISIT HER IN THE TOWER WHERE SHE LIVED PROMISING TO LET DOWN A BASKET
7553-101289-0030 TO DRAW HIM UP AS FAR AS THE ROOF VIRGILIUS WAS ENCHANTED AT THIS QUITE UNEXPECTED FAVOUR AND STEPPED WITH GLEE INTO THE BASKET IT WAS DRAWN UP VERY SLOWLY AND BY AND BY
7553-101289-0031 CAME ALTOGETHER TO A STANDSTILL WHILE FROM ABOVE
7553-101289-0032 ROGUE OF A SORCERER THERE SHALT THOU HANG AND THERE HE HUNG OVER THE MARKET PLACE WHICH WAS SOON THRONGED WITH PEOPLE WHO MADE FUN OF HIM TILL HE WAS MAD WITH RAGE AT LAST THE EMPEROR HEARING OF HIS PLIGHT
7553-101289-0033 AND VIRGILIUS WENT HOME VOWING VENGEANCE THE NEXT MORNING EVERY FIRE IN ROME WENT OUT
7553-101289-0034 THIS WAS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER THE EMPEROR GUESSING THAT THIS WAS THE WORK OF VIRGILIUS BESOUGHT HIM TO BREAK THE SPELL THEN VIRGILIUS ORDERED A SCAFFOLD TO BE ERECTED IN THE MARKET PLACE
7553-101289-0035 IN A SINGLE WHITE GARMENT AND FURTHER HE BADE EVERY ONE TO SNATCH FIRE FROM THE MAIDEN AND TO SUFFER NO NEIGHBOUR TO KINDLE IT AND WHEN THE MAIDEN APPEARED CLAD IN HER WHITE SMOCK
7553-101289-0036 TILL EVERY HEARTH IN ROME WAS ALIGHT AND THEN SHE WAS SUFFERED TO GO WHERE SHE WOULD BUT THE EMPEROR WAS WROTH AT THE VENGEANCE OF VIRGILIUS AND THREW HIM INTO PRISON VOWING THAT HE SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH AND WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY
7553-101289-0037 HE WAS LED OUT TO THE VIMINAL HILL WHERE HE WAS TO DIE HE WENT QUIETLY WITH HIS GUARDS BUT THE DAY WAS HOT AND ON REACHING HIS PLACE OF EXECUTION HE BEGGED FOR SOME WATER A PAIL WAS BROUGHT
7553-101289-0038 AND HE CRYING EMPEROR ALL HAIL SEEK FOR ME IN SICILY JUMPED HEADLONG INTO THE PAIL AND VANISHED FROM THEIR SIGHT FOR SOME TIME
7553-101289-0039 WE HEAR NO MORE OF VIRGILIUS OR HOW HE MADE HIS PEACE WITH THE EMPEROR BUT THE NEXT EVENT IN HIS HISTORY WAS HIS BEING SENT FOR TO THE PALACE TO GIVE THE EMPEROR ADVICE
7553-101289-0040 WHICH WAS THE MOST FAMOUS PUBLIC BUILDING IN THE CITY HE SET UP STATUES REPRESENTING THE GODS WORSHIPPED BY EVERY NATION SUBJECT TO ROME AND IN THE MIDDLE STOOD THE GOD OF ROME HERSELF
7553-101289-0041 EACH OF THE CONQUERED GODS HELD IN ITS HAND A BELL AND IF THERE WAS EVEN A THOUGHT OF TREASON IN ANY OF THE COUNTRIES ITS GOD TURNED ITS BACK UPON THE GOD OF ROME AND RANG ITS BELL FURIOUSLY
7553-101289-0042 AND THE SENATORS CAME HURRYING TO SEE WHO WAS REBELLING AGAINST THE MAJESTY OF THE EMPIRE THEN THEY MADE READY THEIR ARMIES AND MARCHED AGAINST THE FOE
7553-101289-0043 NOW THERE WAS A COUNTRY WHICH HAD LONG FELT BITTER JEALOUSY OF ROME AND WAS ANXIOUS FOR SOME WAY OF BRINGING ABOUT ITS DESTRUCTION SO THE PEOPLE CHOSE THREE MEN WHO COULD BE TRUSTED AND LOADING THEM WITH MONEY
7553-101289-0044 SENT THEM TO ROME BIDDING THEM TO PRETEND THAT THEY WERE DIVINERS OF DREAMS NO SOONER HAD THE MESSENGERS REACHED THE CITY THAN THEY STOLE OUT AT NIGHT AND BURIED A POT OF GOLD FAR DOWN IN THE EARTH
7553-101289-0045 AND LET DOWN ANOTHER INTO THE BED OF THE TIBER JUST WHERE A BRIDGE SPANS THE RIVER NEXT DAY THEY WENT TO THE SENATE HOUSE WHERE THE LAWS WERE MADE AND BOWING LOW THEY SAID OH NOBLE LORDS
7553-101289-0046 LAST NIGHT WE DREAMED THAT BENEATH THE FOOT OF A HILL THERE LIES BURIED A POT OF GOLD HAVE WE YOUR LEAVE TO DIG FOR IT AND LEAVE HAVING BEEN GIVEN THE MESSENGERS TOOK WORKMEN
7553-101289-0047 AND DUG UP THE GOLD AND MADE MERRY WITH IT A FEW DAYS LATER THE DIVINERS AGAIN APPEARED BEFORE THE SENATE AND SAID OH NOBLE LORDS GRANT US LEAVE TO SEEK OUT ANOTHER TREASURE WHICH HAS BEEN REVEALED TO US IN A DREAM
7553-101289-0048 A WEEK OR TWO PASSED BY AND ONCE MORE THEY APPEARED IN THE SENATE HOUSE O NOBLE LORDS SAID THEY LAST NIGHT IN A VISION WE BEHELD TWELVE CASKS OF GOLD LYING UNDER THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE CAPITOL
7553-101289-0049 ON WHICH STANDS THE STATUE OF THE PRESERVATION OF ROME NOW SEEING THAT BY YOUR GOODNESS WE HAVE BEEN GREATLY ENRICHED BY OUR FORMER DREAMS WE WISH IN GRATITUDE TO BESTOW THIS THIRD TREASURE ON YOU
7553-101289-0050 FOR YOUR OWN PROFIT SO GIVE US WORKERS AND WE WILL BEGIN TO DIG WITHOUT DELAY AND RECEIVING PERMISSION THEY BEGAN TO DIG AND WHEN THE MESSENGERS HAD ALMOST UNDERMINED THE CAPITOL
7553-101289-0051 THEY STOLE AWAY AS SECRETLY AS THEY HAD COME AND NEXT MORNING THE STONE GAVE WAY AND THE SACRED STATUE FELL ON ITS FACE AND WAS BROKEN AND THE SENATORS KNEW THAT THEIR GREED HAD BEEN THEIR RUIN
7553-101289-0052 FROM THAT DAY THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE AND EVERY MORNING CROWDS PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE THE EMPEROR COMPLAINING OF THE ROBBERIES MURDERS AND OTHER CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED NIGHTLY IN THE STREETS
7553-101289-0053 THE EMPEROR DESIRING NOTHING SO MUCH AS THE SAFETY OF HIS SUBJECTS TOOK COUNSEL WITH VIRGILIUS HOW THIS VIOLENCE COULD BE PUT DOWN VIRGILIUS THOUGHT HARD FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN HE SPOKE GREAT PRINCE SAID HE
7553-101289-0054 CAUSE A COPPER HORSE AND RIDER TO BE MADE AND STATIONED IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL THEN MAKE A PROCLAMATION THAT AT TEN O'CLOCK A BELL WILL TOLL AND EVERY MAN IS TO ENTER HIS HOUSE AND NOT LEAVE IT AGAIN
7553-101289-0055 THE EMPEROR DID AS VIRGILIUS ADVISED BUT THIEVES AND MURDERERS LAUGHED AT THE HORSE AND WENT ABOUT THEIR MISDEEDS AS USUAL BUT AT THE LAST STROKE OF THE BELL
7553-101289-0056 AND BY DAYLIGHT MEN COUNTED OVER TWO HUNDRED CORPSES THAT IT HAD TRODDEN DOWN THE REST OF THE THIEVES AND THERE WERE STILL MANY REMAINING INSTEAD OF BEING FRIGHTENED INTO HONESTY AS VIRGILIUS HAD HOPED
7553-101289-0057 PREPARED ROPE LADDERS WITH HOOKS TO THEM AND WHEN THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF THE HORSE'S HOOFS THEY STUCK THEIR LADDERS INTO THE WALLS AND CLIMBED UP ABOVE THE REACH OF THE HORSE AND ITS RIDER
7553-101289-0058 THEN THE EMPEROR COMMANDED TWO COPPER DOGS TO BE MADE THAT WOULD RUN AFTER THE HORSE AND WHEN THE THIEVES HANGING FROM THE WALLS MOCKED AND JEERED AT VIRGILIUS AND THE EMPEROR THE DOGS LEAPED HIGH AFTER THEM
7553-101289-0059 WHO RULED OVER THE PROVINCE OF BABYLON AND INDEED SHE WAS SAID TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS IN THE WORLD VIRGILIUS LIKE THE REST LISTENED TO THE STORIES THAT WERE TOLD OF HER
7553-101289-0060 AND FELL SO VIOLENTLY IN LOVE WITH ALL HE HEARD THAT HE BUILT A BRIDGE IN THE AIR WHICH STRETCHED ALL THE WAY BETWEEN ROME AND BABYLON HE THEN PASSED OVER IT TO VISIT THE PRINCESS
7553-101289-0061 GAVE HIM WELCOME AND AFTER SOME CONVERSATION BECAME IN HER TURN ANXIOUS TO SEE THE DISTANT COUNTRY WHERE THIS STRANGER LIVED AND HE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD CARRY HER THERE HIMSELF
7553-101289-0062 WITHOUT WETTING THE SOLES OF HIS FEET THE PRINCESS SPENT SOME DAYS IN THE PALACE OF VIRGILIUS LOOKING AT WONDERS OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER DREAMED THOUGH SHE DECLINED TO ACCEPT THE PRESENTS
7553-101289-0063 HE LONGED TO HEAP ON HER THE HOURS PASSED AS IF THEY WERE MINUTES TILL THE PRINCESS SAID THAT SHE COULD BE NO LONGER ABSENT FROM HER FATHER
7553-101289-0064 THEN VIRGILIUS CONDUCTED HER HIMSELF OVER THE AIRY BRIDGE AND LAID HER GENTLY DOWN ON HER OWN BED WHERE SHE WAS FOUND NEXT MORNING BY HER FATHER
7553-101289-0065 AND PRESENTED THE CUP TO VIRGILIUS WHO DIRECTLY HE HAD DRUNK FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP THEN THE SULTAN ORDERED HIS GUARDS TO BIND HIM AND LEFT HIM THERE TILL THE FOLLOWING DAY
7553-101289-0066 DIRECTLY THE SULTAN WAS UP HE SUMMONED HIS LORDS AND NOBLES INTO HIS GREAT HALL AND COMMANDED THAT THE CORDS WHICH BOUND VIRGILIUS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF AND THE PRISONER BROUGHT BEFORE HIM THE MOMENT HE APPEARED
7553-101289-0067 THE SULTAN'S PASSION BROKE FORTH AND HE ACCUSED HIS CAPTIVE OF THE CRIME OF CONVEYING THE PRINCESS INTO DISTANT LANDS WITHOUT HIS LEAVE VIRGILIUS REPLIED THAT IF HE HAD TAKEN HER AWAY
7553-101289-0068 AND THE PRINCESS FELL ON HER KNEES AND BEGGED SHE MIGHT DIE WITH HIM YOU ARE OUT IN YOUR RECKONING SIR SULTAN SAID VIRGILIUS WHOSE PATIENCE WAS AT AN END AND HE CAST A SPELL OVER THE SULTAN AND HIS LORDS
7553-101289-0069 SO THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT THE GREAT RIVER OF BABYLON WAS FLOWING THROUGH THE HALL AND THAT THEY MUST SWIM FOR THEIR LIVES SO LEAVING THEM TO PLUNGE AND LEAP LIKE FROGS AND FISHES VIRGILIUS TOOK THE PRINCESS IN HIS ARMS
7553-101289-0070 AND CARRIED HER OVER THE AIRY BRIDGE BACK TO ROME NOW VIRGILIUS DID NOT THINK THAT EITHER HIS PALACE OR EVEN ROME ITSELF WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO CONTAIN SUCH A PEARL AS THE PRINCESS SO HE BUILT HER A CITY
7553-101289-0071 WHOSE FOUNDATIONS STOOD UPON EGGS BURIED FAR AWAY DOWN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA AND IN THE CITY WAS A SQUARE TOWER AND ON THE ROOF OF THE TOWER WAS A ROD OF IRON
7553-101289-0072 AND ON THE BOTTLE HE PLACED AN EGG AND FROM THE EGG THERE HUNG CHAINED AN APPLE WHICH HANGS THERE TO THIS DAY AND WHEN THE EGG SHAKES THE CITY QUAKES AND WHEN THE EGG SHALL BE BROKEN
7553-101289-0073 AND THE CITY VIRGILIUS FILLED FULL OF WONDERS
