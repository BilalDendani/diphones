4926-23281-0000 IT WAS WITHOUT ANY MARKS EITHER OF SATISFACTION OR CONCERN MISS MILNER'S PRIDE BEGAN TO BE ALARMED WHILE HE WAS MISTER DORRIFORTH AND CONFINED TO A SINGLE LIFE
4926-23281-0001 HIS INDIFFERENCE TO HER CHARMS WAS RATHER AN HONOURABLE THAN A REPROACHFUL TRAIT IN HIS CHARACTER AND IN REALITY SHE ADMIRED HIM FOR THE INSENSIBILITY BUT ON THE EVE OF BEING AT LIBERTY AND ON THE EVE OF MAKING HIS CHOICE
4926-23281-0002 SHE WAS OFFENDED THAT CHOICE WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY FIXED UPON HER SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE THE DEVOTION OF EVERY MAN WHO SAW HER AND NOT TO OBTAIN IT OF THE MAN FROM WHOM OF ALL OTHERS SHE MOST WISHED IT WAS CRUELLY HUMILIATING
4926-23281-0003 SHE COMPLAINED TO MISS WOODLEY WHO ADVISED HER TO HAVE PATIENCE BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE VIRTUES IN WHICH SHE WAS THE LEAST PRACTISED ENCOURAGED NEVERTHELESS BY HER FRIEND IN THE COMMENDABLE DESIRE OF GAINING THE AFFECTIONS OF HIM
4926-23281-0004 WHO POSSESSED ALL HER OWN SHE HOWEVER LEFT NO MEANS UNATTEMPTED FOR THE CONQUEST BUT SHE BEGAN WITH TOO GREAT A CERTAINTY OF SUCCESS NOT TO BE SENSIBLE OF THE DEEPEST MORTIFICATION IN THE DISAPPOINTMENT
4926-23281-0005 NAY SHE ANTICIPATED A DISAPPOINTMENT AS SHE HAD BEFORE ANTICIPATED HER SUCCESS BY TURNS FEELING THE KEENEST EMOTIONS FROM HOPE AND FROM DESPAIR AS THESE PASSIONS ALTERNATELY GOVERNED HER
4926-23281-0006 SHE WAS ALTERNATELY IN SPIRITS OR DEJECTED IN GOOD OR IN ILL HUMOUR AND THE VICISSITUDES OF HER PROSPECT AT LENGTH GAVE TO HER BEHAVIOUR AN AIR OF CAPRICE WHICH NOT ALL HER FOLLIES HAD TILL NOW PRODUCED
4926-23281-0007 THIS WAS NOT THE WAY TO SECURE THE AFFECTIONS OF LORD ELMWOOD SHE KNEW IT WAS NOT AND BEFORE HIM SHE WAS UNDER SOME RESTRICTION SANDFORD OBSERVED THIS AND WITHOUT RESERVE ADDED TO THE LIST OF HER OTHER FAILINGS HYPOCRISY
4926-23281-0008 IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT MISTER SANDFORD ESTEEMED HER LESS AND LESS EVERY DAY AND AS HE WAS THE PERSON WHO MOST INFLUENCED THE OPINION OF HER GUARDIAN HE BECAME TO HER VERY SOON AN OBJECT NOT MERELY OF DISLIKE BUT OF ABHORRENCE
4926-23281-0009 THERE IS ONE FAULT HOWEVER MISTER SANDFORD I CANNOT LAY TO HER CHARGE AND WHAT IS THAT MY LORD CRIED SANDFORD EAGERLY WHAT IS THAT ONE FAULT WHICH MISS MILNER HAS NOT I NEVER REPLIED LORD ELMWOOD
4926-23281-0010 HEARD MISS MILNER IN YOUR ABSENCE UTTER A SYLLABLE TO YOUR DISADVANTAGE SHE DARES NOT MY LORD BECAUSE SHE IS IN FEAR OF YOU AND SHE KNOWS YOU WOULD NOT SUFFER IT
4926-23281-0011 I AM UNDECEIVED NOW AND SHALL NEVER TAKE THAT LIBERTY AGAIN AS LORD ELMWOOD ALWAYS TREATED SANDFORD WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT HE BEGAN TO FEAR HE HAD BEEN DEFICIENT UPON THIS OCCASION AND THE DISPOSITION WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO TAKE HIS WARD'S PART
4926-23281-0012 WAS LIKELY IN THE END TO PROVE UNFAVOURABLE TO HER FOR PERCEIVING SANDFORD WAS OFFENDED AT WHAT HAD PASSED AS THE ONLY MEANS OF RETRIBUTION HE BEGAN HIMSELF TO LAMENT HER VOLATILE AND CAPTIOUS
4926-23281-0013 PROPENSITIES IN WHICH LAMENTATION SANDFORD NOW FORGETTING HIS AFFRONT JOINED WITH THE HEARTIEST CONCURRENCE ADDING YOU SIR HAVING NOW OTHER CARES TO EMPLOY YOUR THOUGHTS OUGHT TO INSIST UPON HER MARRYING
4926-23281-0014 OR RETIRING INTO THE COUNTRY SHE RETURNED HOME JUST AS THIS CONVERSATION WAS FINISHED AND SANDFORD THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED RANG FOR HIS CANDLE TO RETIRE MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD BEEN AT THE OPERA WITH MISS MILNER CRIED
4926-23281-0015 BLESS ME MISTER SANDFORD ARE YOU NOT WELL YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE US SO EARLY HE REPLIED NO I HAVE A PAIN IN MY HEAD MISS MILNER WHO NEVER LISTENED TO COMPLAINTS WITHOUT SYMPATHY ROSE IMMEDIATELY FROM HER SEAT SAYING
4926-23281-0016 I THINK I NEVER HEARD YOU MISTER SANDFORD COMPLAIN OF INDISPOSITION BEFORE WILL YOU ACCEPT OF MY SPECIFIC FOR THE HEAD ACHE INDEED IT IS A CERTAIN RELIEF I'LL FETCH IT INSTANTLY SHE WENT HASTILY OUT OF THE ROOM AND RETURNED WITH A BOTTLE
4926-23281-0017 WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM WAS A PRESENT FROM LADY LUNEHAM AND WOULD CERTAINLY CURE HIM AND SHE PRESSED IT UPON HIM WITH SUCH AN ANXIOUS EARNESTNESS THAT WITH ALL HIS CHURLISHNESS HE COULD NOT REFUSE TAKING IT
4926-23281-0018 THIS WAS BUT A COMMON PLACE CIVILITY SUCH AS IS PAID BY ONE ENEMY TO ANOTHER EVERY DAY BUT THE MANNER WAS THE MATERIAL PART THE UNAFFECTED CONCERN THE ATTENTION THE GOOD WILL SHE DEMONSTRATED IN THIS LITTLE INCIDENT
4926-23281-0019 WAS THAT WHICH MADE IT REMARKABLE AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK FROM LORD ELMWOOD THE DISPLEASURE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN JUST BEFORE PROVOKED OR RATHER TRANSFORMED IT INTO A DEGREE OF ADMIRATION EVEN SANDFORD WAS NOT INSENSIBLE TO HER BEHAVIOUR
4926-23281-0020 AND IN RETURN WHEN HE LEFT THE ROOM WISHED HER A GOOD NIGHT TO HER AND MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD NOT BEEN WITNESSES OF THE PRECEDING CONVERSATION WHAT SHE HAD DONE APPEARED OF NO MERIT
4926-23281-0021 BUT TO THE MIND OF LORD ELMWOOD THE MERIT WAS INFINITE AND UPON THE DEPARTURE OF SANDFORD HE BEGAN TO BE UNUSUALLY CHEERFUL HE FIRST PLEASANTLY REPROACHED THE LADIES FOR NOT OFFERING HIM A PLACE IN THEIR BOX AT THE OPERA
4926-23281-0022 I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SAID HE AND YOU CONTINUED SHE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO CHURCH MUSIC WILL BE MORE THAN ANY ONE ENCHANTED WITH HEARING THE SOFTER MUSIC OF LOVE
4926-23281-0023 I KNOW NOT WHETHER MY WEAK SENSES WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM SHE HAD HER EYES UPON HIM WHEN HE SPOKE THIS AND SHE DISCOVERED IN HIS THAT WERE FIXED UPON HER A SENSIBILITY UNEXPECTED A KIND OF FASCINATION WHICH ENTICED HER TO LOOK ON
4926-23281-0024 WHILE HER EYELIDS FELL INVOLUNTARILY BEFORE ITS MIGHTY FORCE AND A THOUSAND BLUSHES CROWDED OVER HER FACE HE WAS STRUCK WITH THESE SUDDEN SIGNALS HASTILY RECALLED HIS FORMER COUNTENANCE AND STOPPED THE CONVERSATION MISS WOODLEY
4926-23281-0025 EVERY NECESSARY CEREMONY HAS TAKEN PLACE HERE THEN YOUR LORDSHIP IS NO LONGER IN ORDERS SAID MISS WOODLEY NO THEY HAVE BEEN RESIGNED THESE FIVE DAYS MY LORD I GIVE YOU JOY SAID MISS MILNER
4926-23281-0026 HE THANKED HER BUT ADDED WITH A SIGH IF I HAVE GIVEN UP CONTENT IN SEARCH OF JOY I SHALL PERHAPS BE A LOSER BY THE VENTURE SOON AFTER THIS HE WISHED THEM A GOOD NIGHT AND RETIRED
4926-23281-0027 HAPPY AS MISS MILNER FOUND HERSELF IN HIS COMPANY SHE SAW HIM LEAVE THE ROOM WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION BECAUSE HER HEART WAS IMPATIENT TO GIVE A LOOSE TO ITS HOPES ON THE BOSOM OF MISS WOODLEY SHE BADE MISSUS HORTON IMMEDIATELY GOOD NIGHT AND IN HER FRIEND'S APARTMENT
4926-23281-0028 GAVE WAY TO ALL THE LANGUAGE OF PASSION WARMED WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF MEETING ITS RETURN SHE DESCRIBED THE SENTIMENTS SHE HAD READ IN LORD ELMWOOD'S LOOKS AND THOUGH MISS WOODLEY HAD BEHELD THEM TOO
4926-23281-0029 OR EVEN SUPPOSING HIS WISHES INCLINED TOWARDS HER THERE WERE YET GREAT OBSTACLES BETWEEN THEM WOULD NOT SANDFORD WHO DIRECTED HIS EVERY THOUGHT AND PURPOSE BE CONSULTED UPON THIS AND IF HE WAS UPON WHAT
4926-23281-0030 BUT THE MOST ROMANTIC AFFECTION ON THE PART OF LORD ELMWOOD HAD MISS MILNER TO DEPEND AND HIS LORDSHIP WAS NOT A MAN TO BE SUSPECTED OF SUBMITTING TO THE EXCESS OF ANY PASSION
4926-23281-0031 ANOTHER GENTLEMAN OF FAMILY AND FORTUNE MADE OVERTURES TO MISS MILNER AND HER GUARDIAN SO FAR FROM HAVING HIS THOUGHTS INCLINED TOWARDS HER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT PLEADED THIS LOVER'S CAUSE EVEN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN HE HAD PLEADED
4926-23281-0032 FOR SIR EDWARD AND LORD FREDERICK THUS AT ONCE DESTROYING ALL THOSE PLANS OF HAPPINESS WHICH POOR MISS MILNER HAD FORMED IN CONSEQUENCE HER MELANCHOLY HUMOUR WAS NOW PREDOMINANT SHE CONFINED HERSELF AT HOME AND YET BY HER OWN ORDER
4926-23281-0033 WAS DENIED TO ALL HER VISITORS WHETHER THIS AROSE FROM PURE MELANCHOLY OR THE STILL LINGERING HOPE OF MAKING HER CONQUEST BY THAT SEDATENESS OF MANNERS WHICH SHE KNEW HER GUARDIAN ADMIRED SHE HERSELF PERHAPS DID NOT PERFECTLY KNOW
4926-23281-0034 BE THAT AS IT MAY LORD ELMWOOD COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THIS CHANGE AND ONE MORNING THOUGHT FIT TO MENTION AND TO APPLAUD IT MISS WOODLEY AND SHE WERE AT WORK TOGETHER WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
4926-23281-0035 AND AFTER SITTING SEVERAL MINUTES AND TALKING UPON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS TO WHICH HIS WARD REPLIED WITH A DEJECTION IN HER VOICE AND MANNER HE SAID PERHAPS I AM WRONG MISS MILNER BUT I HAVE OBSERVED THAT YOU ARE LATELY MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN USUAL
4926-23281-0036 SHE BLUSHED AS SHE ALWAYS DID WHEN THE SUBJECT WAS HERSELF HE CONTINUED YOUR HEALTH APPEARS PERFECTLY RESTORED AND YET I HAVE OBSERVED YOU TAKE NO DELIGHT IN YOUR FORMER AMUSEMENTS
4926-23281-0037 AND I WAS GOING TO CONGRATULATE YOU UPON THE CHANGE BUT GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENQUIRE
4926-23281-0038 YOUR LORDSHIP THEN THINKS ALL MY COMMENDABLE DEEDS ARISE FROM ACCIDENT AND THAT I HAVE NO VIRTUES OF MY OWN PARDON ME I THINK YOU HAVE MANY THIS HE SPOKE EMPHATICALLY AND HER BLUSHES INCREASED HE RESUMED
4926-23281-0039 BELIEVE ME MISS MILNER THAT IN THE MIDST OF YOUR GAYEST FOLLIES WHILE YOU THUS CONTINUE TO BLUSH I SHALL REVERENCE YOUR INTERNAL SENSATIONS OH MY LORD DID YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM I AM AFRAID YOU WOULD THINK THEM UNPARDONABLE
4926-23281-0040 THIS WAS SO MUCH TO THE PURPOSE THAT MISS WOODLEY FOUND HERSELF ALARMED BUT WITHOUT REASON MISS MILNER LOVED TOO SINCERELY TO REVEAL IT TO THE OBJECT HE ANSWERED AND DID YOU KNOW SOME OF MINE YOU MIGHT THINK THEM EQUALLY UNPARDONABLE
4926-23281-0041 SHE TURNED PALE AND COULD NO LONGER GUIDE HER NEEDLE IN THE FOND TRANSPORT OF HER HEART SHE IMAGINED THAT HIS LOVE FOR HER WAS AMONG THE SENSATIONS TO WHICH HE ALLUDED SHE WAS TOO MUCH EMBARRASSED TO REPLY AND HE CONTINUED
4926-23281-0042 WE HAVE ALL MUCH TO PARDON IN ONE ANOTHER AND I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE OFFICIOUS PERSON WHO FORCES EVEN HIS GOOD ADVICE IS NOT AS BLAMEABLE AS THE OBSTINATE ONE WHO WILL NOT LISTEN TO IT
4926-23281-0043 AND NOW HAVING MADE A PREFACE TO EXCUSE YOU SHOULD YOU ONCE MORE REFUSE MINE I SHALL VENTURE TO GIVE IT MY LORD I HAVE NEVER YET REFUSED TO FOLLOW YOUR ADVICE BUT WHERE MY OWN PEACE OF MIND WAS SO NEARLY CONCERNED
4926-23281-0044 AS TO HAVE MADE ME CULPABLE HAD I COMPLIED WELL MADAM I SUBMIT TO YOUR DETERMINATIONS AND SHALL NEVER AGAIN OPPOSE YOUR INCLINATION TO REMAIN SINGLE THIS SENTENCE AS IT EXCLUDED THE IDEA OF SOLICITING FOR HIMSELF
4926-23281-0045 GAVE HER THE UTMOST PAIN AND HER EYE GLANCED AT HIM FULL OF REPROACH HE DID NOT OBSERVE IT BUT WENT ON WHILE YOU CONTINUE UNMARRIED IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN YOUR FATHER'S INTENTION THAT YOU SHOULD CONTINUE UNDER MY IMMEDIATE CARE
4926-23281-0046 BUT AS I MEAN FOR THE FUTURE TO RESIDE CHIEFLY IN THE COUNTRY ANSWER ME CANDIDLY DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BE HAPPY THERE FOR AT LEAST THREE PARTS OF THE YEAR AFTER A SHORT HESITATION SHE REPLIED I HAVE NO OBJECTION
4926-23281-0047 I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT HE RETURNED EAGERLY FOR IT IS MY EARNEST DESIRE TO HAVE YOU WITH ME YOUR WELFARE IS DEAR TO ME AS MY OWN AND WERE WE APART CONTINUAL APPREHENSIONS WOULD PREY UPON MY MIND
4926-23281-0048 THE TEAR STARTED IN HER EYE AT THE EARNESTNESS THAT ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS HE SAW IT AND TO SOFTEN HER STILL MORE WITH THE SENSE OF HIS ESTEEM FOR HER HE INCREASED HIS EARNESTNESS WHILE HE SAID IF YOU WILL TAKE THE RESOLUTION TO QUIT LONDON
4926-23281-0049 FOR THE TIME I MENTION THERE SHALL BE NO MEANS OMITTED TO MAKE THE COUNTRY ALL YOU CAN WISH I SHALL INSIST UPON MISS WOODLEY'S COMPANY FOR BOTH OUR SAKES AND IT WILL NOT ONLY BE MY STUDY TO FORM
4926-23281-0050 SUCH A SOCIETY AS YOU MAY APPROVE BUT I AM CERTAIN IT WILL BE LIKEWISE THE STUDY OF LADY ELMWOOD HE WAS GOING ON BUT AS IF A PONIARD HAD THRUST HER TO THE HEART
4926-23281-0051 HE SAW HER COUNTENANCE CHANGE HE LOOKED AT HER STEADFASTLY IT WAS NOT A COMMON CHANGE FROM JOY TO SORROW FROM CONTENT TO UNEASINESS
4926-23281-0052 SHE FELT AND SHE EXPRESSED ANGUISH LORD ELMWOOD WAS ALARMED AND SHOCKED SHE DID NOT WEEP BUT SHE CALLED MISS WOODLEY TO COME TO HER WITH A VOICE THAT INDICATED A DEGREE OF AGONY
4926-23281-0053 MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY SEEING HIS CONSTERNATION AND TREMBLING LEST HE SHOULD GUESS THE SECRET MY LORD MISS MILNER HAS AGAIN DECEIVED YOU YOU MUST NOT TAKE HER FROM LONDON
4926-23281-0054 IT IS THAT AND THAT ALONE WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF HER UNEASINESS HE SEEMED MORE AMAZED STILL AND STILL MORE SHOCKED AT HER DUPLICITY THAN AT HER TORTURE
4926-23281-0055 HOW CAN I JUDGE IF SHE WILL NOT CONFIDE IN ME BUT THUS FOR EVER DECEIVE ME SHE LEANED PALE AS DEATH ON THE SHOULDER OF MISS WOODLEY HER EYE FIXED WITH APPARENT INSENSIBILITY TO ALL THAT WAS SAID WHILE HE CONTINUED
4926-23281-0056 HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS IF I KNEW IF I COULD CONCEIVE THE MEANS HOW TO MAKE HER HAPPY I WOULD SACRIFICE MY OWN HAPPINESS TO HERS MY LORD SAID MISS WOODLEY WITH A SMILE
4926-23281-0057 PERHAPS I MAY CALL UPON YOU HEREAFTER TO FULFIL YOUR WORD HE WAS TOTALLY IGNORANT WHAT SHE MEANT NOR HAD HE LEISURE FROM THE CONFUSION OF HIS THOUGHTS TO REFLECT UPON HER MEANING HE NEVERTHELESS REPLIED WITH WARMTH DO
4926-23281-0058 YOU SHALL FIND I'LL PERFORM IT DO I WILL FAITHFULLY PERFORM IT THOUGH MISS MILNER WAS CONSCIOUS THIS DECLARATION COULD NOT IN DELICACY BE EVER ADDUCED AGAINST HIM
4926-23281-0059 YET THE FERVENT AND SOLEMN MANNER IN WHICH HE MADE IT CHEERED HER SPIRITS AND AS PERSONS ENJOY THE REFLECTION OF HAVING IN THEIR POSSESSION SOME VALUABLE GEM THOUGH THEY ARE DETERMINED NEVER TO USE IT SO SHE UPON THIS WAS COMFORTED AND GREW BETTER
4926-23281-0060 SHE NOW LIFTED UP HER HEAD AND LEANED IT ON HER HAND AS SHE SAT BY THE SIDE OF A TABLE STILL SHE DID NOT SPEAK BUT SEEMED OVERCOME WITH SORROW AS HER SITUATION BECAME HOWEVER LESS ALARMING
4926-23281-0061 AND THOUGH HE DID NOT SAY SO HE WAS AND LOOKED HIGHLY OFFENDED AT THIS JUNCTURE MISTER SANDFORD ENTERED ON BEHOLDING THE PRESENT PARTY IT REQUIRED NOT HIS SAGACITY TO SEE AT THE FIRST VIEW THAT THEY WERE ALL UNEASY
4926-23281-0062 BUT INSTEAD OF THE SYMPATHY THIS MIGHT HAVE EXCITED IN SOME DISPOSITIONS MISTER SANDFORD
4926-23281-0063 YOU DO NOT MISTER SANDFORD LORD ELMWOOD REPLIED NO MY LORD NOR WOULD I WERE I IN YOUR SITUATION WHAT SHOULD MAKE A MAN OF SENSE OUT OF TEMPER BUT A WORTHY OBJECT AND HE LOOKED AT MISS MILNER
4926-23281-0064 THERE ARE NO OBJECTS UNWORTHY OUR CARE REPLIED LORD ELMWOOD BUT THERE ARE OBJECTS ON WHOM ALL CARE IS FRUITLESS YOUR LORDSHIP WILL ALLOW I NEVER YET DESPAIRED OF ANY ONE MISTER SANDFORD AND YET THERE ARE PERSONS OF WHOM IT IS PRESUMPTION
4926-23281-0065 TO ENTERTAIN HOPES AND HE LOOKED AGAIN AT MISS MILNER DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE MISS MILNER ASKED HER FRIEND SEEING HER HOLD IT WITH HER HAND VERY MUCH RETURNED SHE MISTER SANDFORD SAID MISS WOODLEY
4926-23281-0066 DID YOU USE ALL THOSE DROPS MISS MILNER GAVE YOU FOR A PAIN IN THE HEAD YES ANSWERED HE I DID BUT THE QUESTION AT THAT MOMENT SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED HIM
4926-23281-0067 AND I HOPE YOU FOUND BENEFIT FROM THEM SAID MISS MILNER WITH GREAT KINDNESS AS SHE ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND WALKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE ROOM THOUGH MISS WOODLEY FOLLOWED HER SO THAT MISTER SANDFORD WAS LEFT ALONE WITH LORD ELMWOOD
4926-23281-0068 AND MIGHT HAVE CONTINUED HIS UNKIND INSINUATIONS WITHOUT ONE RESTRAINT
