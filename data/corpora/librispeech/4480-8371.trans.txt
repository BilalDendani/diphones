4480-8371-0000 A THIN AND DULL MIST GATHERED OVER THE VALLEYS AND HOLLOWS OF THE BROAD CAMPANIAN FIELDS BUT YET IT WAS REMARKED IN SURPRISE BY THE EARLY FISHERMEN THAT DESPITE THE EXCEEDING STILLNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE WAVES OF THE SEA WERE AGITATED
4480-8371-0001 AND SEEMED AS IT WERE TO RUN DISTURBEDLY BACK FROM THE SHORE
4480-8371-0002 THERE CREPT A HOARSE AND SULLEN MURMUR AS IT GLIDED BY THE LAUGHING PLAINS AND THE GAUDY VILLAS OF THE WEALTHY CITIZENS CLEAR ABOVE THE LOW MIST ROSE THE TIME WORN TOWERS OF THE IMMEMORIAL TOWN
4480-8371-0003 THE RED TILED ROOFS OF THE BRIGHT STREETS THE SOLEMN COLUMNS OF MANY TEMPLES AND THE STATUE CROWNED PORTALS OF THE FORUM AND THE ARCH OF TRIUMPH
4480-8371-0004 HAD SUDDENLY VANISHED AND ITS RUGGED AND HAUGHTY BROW LOOKED WITHOUT A FROWN OVER THE BEAUTIFUL SCENES BELOW DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR THE GATES OF THE CITY WERE ALREADY OPENED HORSEMEN UPON HORSEMEN
4480-8371-0005 AND STRANGERS FROM THE POPULOUS NEIGHBORHOOD OF POMPEII AND NOISILY FAST CONFUSEDLY SWEPT THE MANY STREAMS OF LIFE TOWARDS THE FATAL SHOW DESPITE THE VAST SIZE OF THE AMPHITHEATRE
4480-8371-0006 SO GREAT ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS WAS THE CONCOURSE OF STRANGERS FROM ALL PARTS OF CAMPANIA
4480-8371-0007 TO APPOINTED AND SPECIAL SEATS AND THE INTENSE CURIOSITY WHICH THE TRIAL AND SENTENCE OF TWO CRIMINALS SO REMARKABLE HAD OCCASIONED INCREASED THE CROWD ON THIS DAY TO AN EXTENT WHOLLY UNPRECEDENTED
4480-8371-0008 PRESERVING AS IS NOW THE WONT WITH ITALIANS IN SUCH MEETINGS A WONDERFUL ORDER AND UNQUARRELSOME GOOD HUMOR A STRANGE VISITOR TO ARBACES WAS THREADING HER WAY TO HIS SEQUESTERED MANSION
4480-8371-0009 AT THE SIGHT OF HER QUAINT AND PRIMAEVAL GARB OF HER WILD GAIT AND GESTURES THE PASSENGERS SHE ENCOUNTERED TOUCHED EACH OTHER AND SMILED BUT AS THEY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER COUNTENANCE THE MIRTH WAS HUSHED AT ONCE
4480-8371-0010 FOR THE FACE WAS AS THE FACE OF THE DEAD AND WHAT WITH THE GHASTLY FEATURES AND OBSOLETE ROBES OF THE STRANGER IT SEEMED AS IF ONE LONG ENTOMBED HAD RISEN ONCE MORE AMONGST THE LIVING IN SILENCE AND AWE
4480-8371-0011 AND SHE SOON GAINED THE BROAD PORCH OF THE EGYPTIAN'S PALACE THE BLACK PORTER LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD ASTIR AT AN UNUSUAL HOUR STARTED AS HE OPENED THE DOOR TO HER SUMMONS
4480-8371-0012 THE SLEEP OF THE EGYPTIAN HAD BEEN USUALLY PROFOUND DURING THE NIGHT BUT AS THE DAWN APPROACHED IT WAS DISTURBED BY STRANGE AND UNQUIET DREAMS WHICH IMPRESSED HIM THE MORE
4480-8371-0013 ATHWART WHOSE ETERNAL DARKNESS NO BEAM OF DAY HAD EVER GLANCED AND IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THESE COLUMNS WERE HUGE WHEELS THAT WHIRLED ROUND AND ROUND UNCEASINGLY AND WITH A RUSHING AND ROARING NOISE
4480-8371-0014 ONLY TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT EXTREMITIES OF THE CAVERN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE PILLARS WAS LEFT BARE AND THE APERTURES STRETCHED AWAY INTO GALLERIES NOT WHOLLY DARK BUT DIMLY LIGHTED BY WANDERING AND ERRATIC FIRES THAT METEOR LIKE
4480-8371-0015 AND NOW LEAPED FIERCELY TO AND FRO DARTING ACROSS THE VAST GLOOM IN WILD GAMBOLS SUDDENLY DISAPPEARING AND AS SUDDENLY BURSTING INTO TENFOLD BRILLIANCY AND POWER
4480-8371-0016 AND WHILE HE GAZED WONDERINGLY UPON THE GALLERY TO THE LEFT THIN MIST LIKE AERIAL SHAPES PASSED SLOWLY UP AND WHEN THEY HAD GAINED THE HALL THEY SEEMED TO RISE ALOFT AND TO VANISH AS THE SMOKE VANISHES
4480-8371-0017 IN THE MEASURELESS ASCENT HE TURNED IN FEAR TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE EXTREMITY AND BEHOLD THERE CAME SWIFTLY FROM THE GLOOM ABOVE SIMILAR SHADOWS WHICH SWEPT HURRIEDLY ALONG THE GALLERY TO THE RIGHT
4480-8371-0018 AS IF BORNE INVOLUNTARILY ADOWN THE SIDES OF SOME INVISIBLE STREAM AND THE FACES OF THESE SPECTRES WERE MORE DISTINCT THAN THOSE THAT EMERGED FROM THE OPPOSITE PASSAGE AND ON SOME WAS JOY AND ON OTHERS SORROW
4480-8371-0019 SOME WERE VIVID WITH EXPECTATION AND HOPE SOME UNUTTERABLY DEJECTED BY AWE AND HORROR AND SO THEY PASSED SWIFT AND CONSTANTLY ON TILL THE EYES OF THE GAZER GREW DIZZY AND BLINDED
4480-8371-0020 WITH THE WHIRL OF AN EVER VARYING SUCCESSION OF THINGS IMPELLED BY A POWER APPARENTLY NOT THEIR OWN ARBACES TURNED AWAY AND IN THE RECESS OF THE HALL HE SAW THE MIGHTY FORM OF A GIANTESS SEATED UPON A PILE OF SKULLS
4480-8371-0021 AND HE SAW THAT THE WOOF COMMUNICATED WITH THE NUMBERLESS WHEELS AS IF IT GUIDED THE MACHINERY OF THEIR MOVEMENTS
4480-8371-0022 TILL HE STOOD BEFORE HER FACE TO FACE THE COUNTENANCE OF THE GIANTESS WAS SOLEMN AND HUSHED AND BEAUTIFULLY SERENE IT WAS AS THE FACE OF SOME COLOSSAL SCULPTURE OF HIS OWN ANCESTRAL SPHINX NO PASSION
4480-8371-0023 NO HUMAN EMOTION DISTURBED ITS BROODING AND UNWRINKLED BROW THERE WAS NEITHER SADNESS NOR JOY NOR MEMORY NOR HOPE IT WAS FREE FROM ALL WITH WHICH THE WILD HUMAN HEART CAN SYMPATHIZE
4480-8371-0024 THE MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES RESTED ON ITS BEAUTY IT AWED BUT TERRIFIED NOT IT WAS THE INCARNATION OF THE SUBLIME AND ARBACES FELT THE VOICE LEAVE HIS LIPS
4480-8371-0025 GREW INTO SOMETHING LIKE A SHAPE A SPECTRAL OUTLINE OF THE WINGS AND TALONS OF AN EAGLE WITH LIMBS FLOATING FAR AND INDISTINCTLY ALONG THE AIR AND EYES THAT ALONE CLEARLY AND VIVIDLY SEEN
4480-8371-0026 GLARED STONILY AND REMORSELESSLY ON HIS OWN WHAT ART THOU
4480-8371-0027 THEN IS MY WISDOM VAIN GROANED THE DREAMER
4480-8371-0028 HE WITHERED HE GASPED BENEATH THE INFLUENCE OF THE BLIGHTING BREATH HE FELT HIMSELF BLASTED
4480-8371-0029 HE COLLECTED HIMSELF HE BLESSED THE GODS WHOM HE DISBELIEVED THAT HE WAS IN A DREAM HE TURNED HIS EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE HE SAW THE DAWNING LIGHT BREAK THROUGH HIS SMALL BUT LOFTY WINDOW
4480-8371-0030 HE WAS IN THE PRECINCTS OF DAY HE REJOICED HE SMILED HIS EYES FELL AND OPPOSITE TO HIM HE BEHELD THE GHASTLY FEATURES THE LIFELESS EYE THE LIVID LIP
4480-8371-0031 OF THE HAG OF VESUVIUS HA HE CRIED PLACING HIS HANDS BEFORE HIS EYES AS TO SHUT OUT THE GRISLY VISION DO I DREAM STILL AM I WITH THE DEAD
4480-8371-0032 THOU ART WITH ONE DEATH LIKE BUT NOT DEAD RECOGNIZE THY FRIEND AND SLAVE THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE
4480-8371-0033 SLOWLY THE SHUDDERS THAT PASSED OVER THE LIMBS OF THE EGYPTIAN CHASED EACH OTHER AWAY FAINTLIER AND FAINTLIER DYING TILL HE WAS HIMSELF AGAIN IT WAS A DREAM THEN SAID HE WELL LET ME DREAM NO MORE
4480-8371-0034 OR THE DAY CANNOT COMPENSATE FOR THE PANGS OF NIGHT
4480-8371-0035 WHILE IT BE TIME THOU KNOWEST THAT I HOLD MY HOME ON THAT MOUNTAIN BENEATH WHICH OLD TRADITION SAITH THERE YET BURN THE FIRES OF THE RIVER
4480-8371-0036 CREEP SLOWLY SLOWLY ON AND HEARD MANY AND MIGHTY SOUNDS HISSING AND ROARING THROUGH THE GLOOM BUT LAST NIGHT AS I LOOKED THEREON BEHOLD
4480-8371-0037 THE STREAM WAS NO LONGER DULL BUT INTENSELY AND FIERCELY LUMINOUS AND WHILE I GAZED THE BEAST THAT LIVETH WITH ME AND WAS COWERING BY MY SIDE
4480-8371-0038 ALL THE NIGHT THE ROCK SHAKE AND TREMBLE AND THOUGH THE AIR WAS HEAVY AND STILL THERE WERE THE HISSING OF PENT WINDS AND THE GRINDING AS OF WHEELS BENEATH THE GROUND
4480-8371-0039 I LOOKED AGAIN DOWN THE ABYSS
4480-8371-0040 AND THE STREAM ITSELF WAS BROADER FIERCER REDDER THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE THEN I WENT FORTH AND ASCENDED TO THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCK AND IN THAT SUMMIT
4480-8371-0041 THERE APPEARED A SUDDEN AND VAST HOLLOW WHICH I HAD NEVER PERCEIVED BEFORE
4480-8371-0042 FAINT SMOKE AND THE VAPOR WAS DEATHLY AND I GASPED AND SICKENED AND NEARLY DIED
4480-8371-0043 I TOOK MY GOLD AND MY DRUGS AND LEFT THE HABITATION OF MANY YEARS FOR I REMEMBERED THE DARK ETRUSCAN PROPHECY WHICH SAITH
4480-8371-0044 THERE SHALL BE WOE AND WEEPING IN THE HEARTHS OF THE CHILDREN OF THE SEA DREAD MASTER ERE I LEAVE THESE WALLS FOR SOME MORE DISTANT DWELLING
4480-8371-0045 I DREAMT NOT THAT THERE LIVED ONE OUT OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF ISIS WHO WOULD HAVE SAVED ARBACES FROM DESTRUCTION THE SIGNS THOU HAST SEEN IN THE BED OF THE EXTINCT VOLCANO CONTINUED THE EGYPTIAN MUSINGLY
4480-8371-0046 WHITHER WENDEST THOU I SHALL CROSS OVER TO HERCULANEUM THIS DAY AND WANDERING THENCE ALONG THE COAST SHALL SEEK OUT A NEW HOME I AM FRIENDLESS MY TWO COMPANIONS
4480-8371-0047 THOU HAST PROMISED ME TWENTY ADDITIONAL YEARS OF LIFE AYE SAID THE EGYPTIAN I HAVE PROMISED THEE BUT WOMAN HE ADDED LIFTING HIMSELF UPON HIS ARM AND GAZING CURIOUSLY ON HER FACE
4480-8371-0048 TELL ME I PRAY THEE WHEREFORE THOU WISHEST TO LIVE WHAT SWEETS DOST THOU DISCOVER IN EXISTENCE IT IS NOT LIFE THAT IS SWEET BUT DEATH THAT IS AWFUL
4480-8371-0049 REPLIED THE HAG IN A SHARP IMPRESSIVE TONE THAT STRUCK FORCIBLY UPON THE HEART OF THE VAIN STAR SEER HE WINCED AT THE TRUTH OF THE REPLY AND NO LONGER ANXIOUS TO RETAIN SO UNINVITING A COMPANION HE SAID
4480-8371-0050 TIME WANES I MUST PREPARE FOR THE SOLEMN SPECTACLE OF THIS DAY SISTER FAREWELL ENJOY THYSELF AS THOU CANST OVER THE ASHES OF LIFE THE HAG
4480-8371-0051 WHO HAD PLACED THE COSTLY GIFT OF ARBACES IN THE LOOSE FOLDS OF HER VEST NOW ROSE TO DEPART WHEN SHE HAD GAINED THE DOOR SHE PAUSED TURNED BACK AND SAID THIS MAY BE THE LAST TIME WE MEET ON EARTH
4480-8371-0052 BUT WHITHER FLIETH THE FLAME WHEN IT LEAVES THE ASHES WANDERING TO AND FRO UP AND DOWN AS AN EXHALATION ON THE MORASS THE FLAME MAY BE SEEN IN THE MARSHES OF THE LAKE BELOW
4480-8371-0053 AND THE WITCH AND THE MAGIAN THE PUPIL AND THE MASTER THE GREAT ONE AND THE ACCURSED ONE MAY MEET AGAIN FAREWELL OUT CROAKER
4480-8371-0054 MUTTERED ARBACES AS THE DOOR CLOSED ON THE HAG'S TATTERED ROBES AND IMPATIENT OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS NOT YET RECOVERED FROM THE PAST DREAM HE HASTILY SUMMONED HIS SLAVES
4480-8371-0055 IT WAS THE CUSTOM TO ATTEND THE CEREMONIALS OF THE AMPHITHEATRE IN FESTIVE ROBES AND ARBACES ARRAYED HIMSELF THAT DAY WITH MORE THAN USUAL CARE HIS TUNIC WAS OF THE MOST DAZZLING WHITE
4480-8371-0056 OVER HIS TUNIC FLOWED A LOOSE EASTERN ROBE HALF GOWN HALF MANTLE GLOWING IN THE RICHEST HUES OF THE TYRIAN DYE
4480-8371-0057 AND THE LONG FAMILY OF ARBACES WERE ALREADY ARRANGED IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE LITTER OF THEIR LORD ONLY TO THEIR GREAT CHAGRIN THE SLAVES IN ATTENDANCE ON IONE
4480-8371-0058 WERE CONDEMNED TO REMAIN AT HOME CALLIAS SAID ARBACES APART TO HIS FREEDMAN WHO WAS BUCKLING ON HIS GIRDLE I AM WEARY OF POMPEII I PROPOSE TO QUIT IT IN THREE DAYS SHOULD THE WIND FAVOR
4480-8371-0059 THOU KNOWEST THE VESSEL THAT LIES IN THE HARBOR WHICH BELONGED TO NARSES OF ALEXANDRIA I HAVE PURCHASED IT OF HIM THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE SHALL BEGIN TO REMOVE MY STORES SO SOON TIS WELL ARBACES SHALL BE OBEYED
4480-8371-0060 AND HIS WARD IONE ACCOMPANIES ME ENOUGH IS THE MORNING FAIR DIM AND OPPRESSIVE IT WILL PROBABLY BE INTENSELY HOT IN THE FORENOON THE POOR GLADIATORS AND MORE WRETCHED CRIMINALS
4480-8371-0061 DESCEND AND SEE THAT THE SLAVES ARE MARSHALLED
4480-8371-0062 AND THENCE UPON THE PORTICO WITHOUT HE SAW THE DENSE MASSES OF MEN POURING FAST INTO THE AMPHITHEATRE AND HEARD THE CRY OF THE ASSISTANTS AND THE CRACKING OF THE CORDAGE
4480-8371-0063 MOLESTED BY NO DISCOMFORTING RAY WERE TO BEHOLD AT LUXURIOUS EASE THE AGONIES OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES SUDDENLY A WILD STRANGE SOUND WENT FORTH AND AS SUDDENLY DIED AWAY IT WAS THE ROAR
4480-8371-0064 OF THE LION THERE WAS A SILENCE IN THE DISTANT CROWD BUT THE SILENCE WAS FOLLOWED BY JOYOUS LAUGHTER THEY WERE MAKING MERRY AT THE HUNGRY IMPATIENCE OF THE ROYAL BEAST BRUTES
4480-8371-0065 ARE YE LESS HOMICIDES THAN I AM I SLAY BUT IN SELF DEFENCE YE MAKE MURDER PASTIME HE TURNED WITH A RESTLESS AND CURIOUS EYE TOWARDS VESUVIUS BEAUTIFULLY GLOWED THE GREEN VINEYARDS ROUND ITS BREAST
4480-8371-0066 AND TRANQUIL AS ETERNITY LAY IN THE BREATHLESS SKIES THE FORM OF THE MIGHTY HILL WE HAVE TIME YET IF THE EARTHQUAKE BE NURSING THOUGHT ARBACES AND HE TURNED FROM THE SPOT
