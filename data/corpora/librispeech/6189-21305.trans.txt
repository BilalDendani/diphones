6189-21305-0000 SO I UNDERSTAND YOU WISH ME TO GO DOWN AT ONCE SAID LOUIS CRAVEN THIS IS FRIDAY SAY MONDAY WHARTON NODDED HE AND CRAVEN WERE SITTING IN MARCELLA'S LITTLE SITTING ROOM
6189-21305-0001 THEIR HOSTESS AND EDITH CRAVEN HAD ESCAPED THROUGH THE DOOR IN THE BACK KITCHEN COMMUNICATING WITH THE HURDS TENEMENT SO THAT THE TWO MEN MIGHT BE LEFT ALONE A WHILE THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THEM HAD GONE SMOOTHLY
6189-21305-0002 AND LOUIS CRAVEN HAD ACCEPTED IMMEDIATE EMPLOYMENT ON THE LABOUR CLARION AS THE PAPER'S CORRESPONDENT IN THE MIDLANDS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE IMPORTANT STRIKE JUST PENDING
6189-21305-0003 WHARTON WHOSE TENDENCY IN MATTERS OF BUSINESS WAS ALWAYS TO GO RATHER FURTHER THAN HE HAD MEANT TO GO FOR THE SAKE GENERALLY OF MAKING AN IMPRESSION ON THE MAN WITH WHOM HE WAS DEALING HAD SPOKEN OF A TWO YEARS ENGAGEMENT
6189-21305-0004 AND HAD OFFERED TWO HUNDRED A YEAR SO FAR AS THAT WENT CRAVEN WAS ABUNDANTLY SATISFIED AND I UNDERSTAND FROM YOU HE SAID THAT THE PAPER GOES IN FOR THE STRIKE THAT YOU WILL FIGHT IT THROUGH
6189-21305-0005 HE FIXED HIS PENETRATING GREENISH EYES ON HIS COMPANION LOUIS CRAVEN WAS NOW A TALL MAN WITH NARROW SHOULDERS A FINE OVAL HEAD AND FACE DELICATE FEATURES AND A NERVOUS LOOK OF SHORT SIGHT
6189-21305-0006 PRODUCING IN APPEARANCE AND MANNER A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF THIN GRACE AND OF A COURTESY WHICH WAS APT TO PASS UNACCOUNTABLY INTO SARCASM WHARTON HAD NEVER FELT HIMSELF PERSONALLY AT EASE WITH HIM
6189-21305-0007 EITHER NOW OR IN THE OLD DAYS OF VENTURIST DEBATES CERTAINLY WE SHALL FIGHT IT THROUGH WHARTON REPLIED WITH EMPHASIS I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SECRETARY'S STATEMENT WHICH I NOW HAND OVER TO YOU
6189-21305-0008 AND I NEVER SAW A CLEARER CASE THE POOR WRETCHES HAVE BEEN SKINNED TOO LONG IT IS HIGH TIME THE PUBLIC BACKED THEM UP THERE ARE TWO OF THE MASTERS IN THE HOUSE DENNY I SHOULD SAY BELONGED QUITE TO THE WORST TYPE OF EMPLOYER GOING
6189-21305-0009 HE SPOKE WITH LIGHT VENOM BUTTONING HIS COAT AS HE SPOKE WITH THE AIR OF THE BUSY PUBLIC MAN WHO MUST NOT LINGER OVER AN APPOINTMENT OH DENNY SAID CRAVEN MUSING YES DENNY IS A HARD MAN
6189-21305-0010 BUT A JUST ONE ACCORDING TO HIS LIGHTS THERE ARE PLENTY WORSE THAN HE WHARTON WAS DISAGREEABLY REMINDED OF THE VENTURIST HABIT OF NEVER ACCEPTING ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID QUITE AS IT STOOD OF NOT EVEN IN SMALL THINGS SWEARING TO THE WORDS OF ANYBODY
6189-21305-0011 HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE QUICK PASSING FEELING THAT HIS JUDGMENT WITH REGARD TO DENNY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR CRAVEN ONE THING MORE SAID CRAVEN SUDDENLY AS WHARTON LOOKED FOR HIS STICK YOU SEE THERE IS TALK OF ARBITRATION
6189-21305-0012 OH YES I KNOW SAID WHARTON IMPATIENTLY A MERE BLIND THE MEN HAVE BEEN DONE BY IT TWICE BEFORE THEY GET SOME BIG WIG FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NOT IN THE TRADE INDEED BUT NEXT DOOR TO IT AND OF COURSE THE AWARD GOES AGAINST THE MEN
6189-21305-0013 THEN THE PAPER WILL NOT BACK ARBITRATION CRAVEN TOOK OUT A NOTE BOOK NO THE QUARREL ITSELF IS AS PLAIN AS A PIKESTAFF THE MEN ARE ASKING FOR A MERE PITTANCE AND MUST GET IT IF THEY ARE TO LIVE

6189-21305-0015 CRAVEN LOOKED UP ABSENTLY AND I THINK HE SAID YOU GAVE ME MISTER THORPE'S ADDRESS MISTER THORPE WAS THE SECRETARY AGAIN WHARTON GULPED DOWN HIS ANNOYANCE
6189-21305-0016 IF HE CHOSE TO BE EXPANSIVE IT WAS NOT FOR CRAVEN TO TAKE NO NOTICE CRAVEN HOWEVER EXCEPT IN PRINT WHERE HE COULD BE AS VEHEMENT AS ANYBODY ELSE NEVER SPOKE BUT IN THE DRIEST WAY OF THOSE WORKMAN'S GRIEVANCES WHICH IN REALITY BURNT AT THE MAN'S HEART
6189-21305-0017 A DEEP DISDAIN FOR WHAT HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIM THE CHEAPEST FORM OF SELF ADVERTISEMENT HELD HIM BACK IT WAS THIS DRYNESS COMBINED WITH AN AMAZING DISINTERESTEDNESS WHICH HAD SO FAR STOOD IN HIS WAY
6189-21305-0018 MAY WE COME IN SAID MARCELLA'S VOICE BY ALL MEANS SAID WHARTON WITH A COMPLETE CHANGE OF TONE BUSINESS IS UP AND I AM OFF HE TOOK UP HIS HAT AS HE SPOKE NOT AT ALL
6189-21305-0019 TEA IS JUST COMING WITHOUT WHICH NO GUEST DEPARTS SAID MARCELLA TAKING AS SHE SPOKE A LITTLE TRAY FROM THE RED HAIRED DAISY WHO FOLLOWED HER AND MOTIONING TO THE CHILD TO BRING THE TEA TABLE WHARTON LOOKED AT HER IRRESOLUTE
6189-21305-0020 HE HAD SPENT HALF AN HOUR WITH HER TETE A TETE BEFORE LOUIS CRAVEN ARRIVED AND HE WAS REALLY DUE AT THE HOUSE BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS ON THE SCENE AGAIN HE DID NOT FIND IT SO EASY TO GO AWAY
6189-21305-0021 HOW ASTONISHINGLY BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS EVEN IN THIS DISGUISE SHE WORE HER NURSE'S DRESS FOR HER SECOND DAILY ROUND BEGAN AT HALF PAST FOUR AND HER CLOAK BONNET AND BAG WERE LYING READY ON A CHAIR BESIDE HER
6189-21305-0022 THE DRESS WAS PLAIN BROWN HOLLAND WITH COLLAR AND ARMLETS OF WHITE LINEN BUT TO WHARTON'S EYE THE DARK ITALIAN HEAD AND THE LONG SLENDERNESS OF FORM HAD NEVER SHOWN MORE FINELY HE HESITATED AND STAYED
6189-21305-0023 ALL WELL SAID MARCELLA IN A HALF WHISPER AS SHE PASSED LOUIS CRAVEN ON HER WAY TO GET SOME CAKE HE NODDED AND SMILED AND SHE WENT BACK TO THE TEA TABLE WITH AN EYE ALL GAIETY PLEASED WITH HERSELF AND EVERYBODY ELSE
6189-21305-0024 THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR THAT FOLLOWED WENT AGREEABLY ENOUGH WHARTON SAT AMONG THE LITTLE GROUP FAR TOO CLEVER TO PATRONISE A CAT LET ALONE A VENTURIST BUT NONE THE LESS MASTER AND CONSCIOUS MASTER OF THE OCCASION
6189-21305-0025 BECAUSE IT SUITED HIM TO TAKE THE AIRS OF EQUALITY CRAVEN SAID LITTLE BUT AS HE LOUNGED IN MARCELLA'S LONG CANE CHAIR WITH HIS ARMS BEHIND HIS HEAD HIS SERENE AND HAZY AIR SHOWED HIM CONTENTED
6189-21305-0026 AND MARCELLA TALKED AND LAUGHED WITH THE ANIMATION THAT BELONGS TO ONE WHOSE PLOTS FOR IMPROVING THE UNIVERSE HAVE AT LEAST TEMPORARILY SUCCEEDED
6189-21305-0027 OR DID IT BETRAY PERHAPS A WOMAN'S SECRET CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME PRESENCE BESIDE HER MORE TROUBLING AND MAGNETIC TO HER THAN OTHERS WELL THEN FRIDAY SAID WHARTON AT LAST WHEN HIS TIME WAS MORE THAN SPENT
