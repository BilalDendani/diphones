2581-157858-0002 HE EVEN FOUND A QUEER SORT OF INTEREST IN EXAMINING HIS STOCK OF TIES AND OTHER GARMENTS THE MEMORY OF ELIZABETH DALSTAN'S WORDS WAS STILL IN HIS BRAIN THEY HAD BECOME THE TEXT OF HIS LIFE THIS HE TOLD HIMSELF WAS HIS BIRTHDAY
2581-157858-0003 THE ENVELOPE OF THE LETTER HE OPENED WITH A LITTLE MORE COMPUNCTION IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE PRINTED NOTEPAPER OF THE DOUGLAS ROMILLY SHOE COMPANY AND WAS OF NO GREAT LENGTH DEAR MISTER ROMILLY

2581-157858-0007 HIS SENSE OF ENJOYMENT WAS SO EXTRAORDINARILY KEEN THAT HE FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO ANY OF THE USUAL LIGHT OCCUPATIONS OF IDLE TRAVELLERS HE WAS CONTENT TO STAND BY THE RAIL AND GAZE ACROSS THE SEA A NEW WONDER TO HIM
2581-157858-0008 OR TO LIE ABOUT IN HIS STEAMER CHAIR AND LISTEN WITH HALF CLOSED EYES
2581-157858-0009 HIS MIND TURNED BY CHANCE TO ONE OF THOSE STORIES OF WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN A SUDDEN NEW VIGOUR OF THOUGHT SEEMED TO REND IT INSIDE OUT ALMOST IN THOSE FIRST FEW SECONDS
2581-157858-0010 THE WRETCHED SURROUNDINGS THE ODORIFEROUS FOOD THE THICK CROCKERY THE SMOKE PALLED VISTA OF ROOFS AND CHIMNEYS THE GENIUS OF A STEVENSON WOULD HAVE BECOME DWARFED IN SUCH SURROUNDINGS A PHRASE A HAPPY IDEA SUDDENLY CAUGHT HIS FANCY
2581-157858-0011 HE ITCHED FOR A PENCIL AND PAPER THEN HE LOOKED UP TO FIND THE ONE THING WANTING ELIZABETH DALSTAN FOLLOWED BY A MAID CARRYING RUGS AND CUSHIONS HAD PAUSED SMILING BY HIS SIDE

2581-157858-0018 AND THE STORY ITSELF WAS UNHAPPINESS SO NECESSARY AFTER ALL THEY SUDDENLY SEEMED TO CRUMBLE AWAY INTO INSIGNIFICANCE THESE MEN AND WOMEN OF HIS CREATION IN THEIR PLACE HE COULD ALMOST FANCY A RACE OF LARGER BEINGS
2581-157858-0019 A MORE EXTENSIVE CANVAS A MORE SPLENDID A RIPER AND RICHER VOCABULARY NOTHING THAT I HAVE EVER DONE HE SIGHED IS WORTH TALKING TO YOU ABOUT BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE MY FRIEND WELL

2581-157858-0021 WOULD YOU HELP ME I WONDER HE ASKED IMPULSIVELY SHE LOOKED AWAY FROM HIM OUT ACROSS THE STEAMER RAIL SHE SEEMED TO BE MEASURING WITH HER EYES THE ROLL OF THE SHIP AS IT ROSE AND FELL IN THE TROUGH OF THE SEA YOU ARE A STRANGE PERSON SHE SAID
