2531-156724-0000 I THINK THEY'RE OPEN TILL SIX SAID DAVID SHAKING THE SAND OUT OF HIS SHOES ARE WE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING PRECISELY MY BOY A HARDWARE STORE SHOULD HAVE WHAT WE NEED NOW YOU WILL TAKE OUR GOLD AND PURCHASE THE FOLLOWING
2531-156724-0001 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH IT MY BOY THE FELINE'S EXISTENCE WAS TERMINATED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF ITS INQUISITIVENESS WHAT DID YOU SAY CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT EXPLAINED THE PHOENIX OH BUT
2531-156724-0002 NOW RUN ALONG MY BOY A VERY IMPORTANT THOUGHT HAS JUST COME TO ME I MUST MEDITATE A WHILE THE PHOENIX GLANCED AT THE THICKET AND HID A YAWN BEHIND ONE WING OH ALL RIGHT SAID DAVID I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING THEN
2531-156724-0003 IT WASN'T UNTIL HE GOT HOME THAT HE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING HE COULDN'T SPEND PIRATE GOLD PIECES OR EVEN SHOW THEM TO ANYONE WITHOUT BEING ASKED A LOT OF EMBARRASSING QUESTIONS WHAT TO DO ASK DAD OR MOTHER OR AUNT AMY TO LEND HIM SOME MONEY
2531-156724-0004 MORE EMBARRASSING QUESTIONS WELL HE WOULD HAVE TO ROB HIS BANK BUT WAIT WHY HADN'T HE REMEMBERED JUST BEFORE THEY HAD MOVED UNCLE CHARLES HAD GIVEN HIM A TEN DOLLAR BILL AS A FAREWELL PRESENT HE HAD BEEN SAVING IT FOR A MODEL AIRPLANE
2531-156724-0005 BUT THE EXCITEMENT OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD DRIVEN IT COMPLETELY OUT OF HIS MIND OF COURSE THE PHOENIX'S PLAN WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY MODEL PLANE COULD BE SO HE KEPT THE GOLD PIECES TIED UP IN HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND TOOK HIS TEN DOLLARS TO A HARDWARE STORE
2531-156724-0006 WHERE HE BOUGHT WHAT THE PHOENIX WANTED A COIL OF ROPE AN ELECTRIC DOOR BELL A PUSHBUTTON AND ONE HUNDRED FEET OF INSULATED WIRE THEN HE BROUGHT THE PACKAGE HOME
2531-156724-0007 WHATEVER THE PLAN WAS THEY WOULD HAVE TO CARRY IT OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TWO DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE THE SCIENTIST HAD SHOWN UP THE NEW GUN HE HAD ORDERED MIGHT ARRIVE AT ANY TIME NOW PERHAPS EVEN TODAY WHEN THEY HAD BEEN DIGGING UP THE PIRATE TREASURE
2531-156724-0008 EARLY NEXT MORNING DAVID CLIMBED UP TO THE LEDGE BRINGING WITH HIM THE COIL OF ROPE AND THE HATCHET AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT HE HAD ADDED A PAPER BAG FULL OF COOKIES HERE'S THE STUFF PHOENIX HE CALLED OUT AS HE STEPPED ONTO THE LEDGE WHERE ARE YOU
2531-156724-0009 THERE WAS A CRASH FROM THE THICKET AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD JUMPED UP IN IT SUDDENLY AND THE PHOENIX STUMBLED OUT RUBBING ITS EYES AH SPLENDID MY BOY YES I WAS JUST AH THINKING PHOENIX SAID DAVID I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU AGAIN WHAT YOUR PLAN IS
2531-156724-0010 BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL TELL ME WHEN IT'S TIME BUT WHATEVER IT IS WE'D BETTER DO IT RIGHT NOW THE SCIENTIST MAY SHOW UP ANY MINUTE PRECISELY MY BOY NEVER PUT OFF UNTIL TOMORROW WHAT CAN BE DONE TODAY ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROVERBS
2531-156724-0011 WE SHALL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY HERE THE PHOENIX CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BAG IN DAVID'S HAND AND ADDED HASTILY BUT OF COURSE WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT FIRST THINGS COME FIRST YOU MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT MORE SAID THE PHOENIX FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THERE WEREN'T ANY MORE IN THE JAR DAVID SAID
2531-156724-0012 PHOENIX PLEASE TELL ME WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO I DON'T CARE IF CURIOSITY DID KILL THE CAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE ROPE AND WIRE AND BELL ALL NIGHT AND I CAN'T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OUT OF IT THE PHOENIX GAVE A PLEASED LAUGH
2531-156724-0013 OF COURSE YOU CANNOT MY BOY THE PLAN IS FAR TOO PROFOUND FOR YOU TO GUESS WHAT IT IS BUT SET YOUR MIND AT REST I SHALL NOW EXPLAIN THE ROPE AND HATCHET DAVID LEANED FORWARD EAGERLY NOW SCIENTISTS YOU KNOW HAVE FIXED HABITS
2531-156724-0014 OUR PARTICULAR SCIENTIST IS A DAYTIME CREATURE THAT IS TO SAY HE COMES AT DAWN AND GOES AT DUSK HIS INVARIABLE HABIT MY BOY WELL THERE YOU ARE MY BOY SAID THE PHOENIX TRIUMPHANTLY
2531-156724-0015 WE SHALL SLEEP DURING THE DAY AND CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION AT NIGHT OH SAID DAVID HE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A WHILE THEN ASKED BUT SUPPOSE THE SCIENTIST COMES UP ON THE LEDGE DURING THE DAY AND CATCHES YOU ASLEEP AHA THAT IS WHERE THE ROPE AND HATCHET COME IN
2531-156724-0016 NEVER FEAR MY BOY I THOUGHT OF THAT ALSO WE ARE GOING TO CONSTRUCT A SNARE AT EACH END OF THE LEDGE HOW HAND ME THAT TWIG MY BOY THE PHOENIX TOOK THE TWIG FOUND A BARE SPOT OF EARTH AND SKETCHED A PICTURE
2531-156724-0017 FIRST WE FIND A SAPLING AND CLEAR THE BRANCHES FROM IT WITH THE HATCHET LIKE THIS NEXT WE GET A STAKE CUT A NOTCH IN IT AND DRIVE IT INTO THE GROUND SO THE SAPLING IS BENT DOWN TO IT AND FITTED INTO THE NOTCH WHICH HOLDS IT DOWN YOU SEE MY BOY
2531-156724-0018 NOW WE MAKE A NOOSE SO FROM A PIECE OF ROPE TIE IT TO THE END OF THE SAPLING AND SPREAD THE LOOP OUT ON THE PATH THIS WAY THE WHOLE SNARE IS HIDDEN UNDER GRASS AND LEAVES
2531-156724-0019 THE PHOENIX BEAMED AND FLUNG OUT ITS WINGS IN A DRAMATIC GESTURE JUST PICTURE IT MY DEAR CHAP
2531-156724-0020 THE UNWARY FOOTSTEP THE SAPLING JARRED OUT OF THE NOTCH SPRINGING UPWARD THE TIGHTENED NOOSE AND OUR ARCHENEMY DANGLING BY THE FOOT IN MID AIR COMPLETELY AT OUR MERCY MAGNIFICENT GOLLY PHOENIX SAID DAVID THAT'S PRETTY CLEVER
2531-156724-0021 CLEVER MY BOY BETTER TO SAY A STROKE OF GENIUS ONLY I PHOENIX COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AND CONSIDER THE POETIC JUSTICE OF IT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF TRAP THAT THE SCIENTIST ONCE SET FOR ME
2531-156724-0022 FIRST THEY HAD TO FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF SAPLING SPRINGY AND STRONG THE SAPLING HAD TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE ONE BY THE GOAT TRAIL THE OTHER AT THE FAR END OF THE LEDGE WHEN THEY HAD BEEN CHOSEN DAVID HAD TO SHINNY UP THEM TO LOP OFF THEIR BRANCHES
2531-156724-0023 AND FITTING IT INTO THE NOTCH IT TOOK THE WEIGHT OF BOTH OF THEM TO BRING THE SAPLING TO THE GROUND IF THEY GOT THE SLIGHTEST BIT OFF BALANCE IT WOULD SPRING UP AGAIN ONCE DAVID FELL OFF THE SAPLING WENT SWISH BACK INTO THE AIR
2531-156724-0024 FLINGING THE ASTONISHED PHOENIX THIRTY FEET UP THE MOUNTAINSIDE
2531-156724-0025 THEY SAT DOWN AND LOOKED PROUDLY AT EACH OTHER MY BOY SAID THE PHOENIX I HAVE HAD A WIDE AND SOMETIMES PAINFUL EXPERIENCE WITH TRAPS
2531-156724-0026 WE SHALL BURN THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE REACH IT MY BOY NOW DO YOU HAVE THE PLIERS WIRE CUTTERS AND SCREW DRIVER BELOW YES THEY'RE DOWN IN THE CELLAR WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THEM PHOENIX PATIENCE PATIENCE
2531-156724-0027 YOU WILL BE TOLD WHEN THE TIME COMES I SHALL MEET YOU TONIGHT AFTER DARK AS SOON AS IT IS SAFE FOR ME TO COME DOWN I TRUST YOU WILL HAVE EVERYTHING READY ARE YOU COMING DOWN PRECISELY MY BOY A RISK I ADMIT BUT A NECESSARY ONE
2531-156724-0028 THERE IS A HEDGE AT THE BACK OF YOUR HOUSE IS THERE NOT SPLENDID YOU MAY AWAIT ME THERE DAVID SITTING IN THE SHADOW OF THE HEDGE JUMPED WHEN HE HEARD THE PHOENIX'S QUIET GOOD EVENING MY BOY PHOENIX HE WHISPERED HOW DID YOU DO IT
2531-156724-0029 GOLLY I DIDN'T SEE YOU AT ALL AND IT ISN'T EVEN DARK YET I HAVE BEEN HUNTED LONG ENOUGH MY BOY TO HAVE LEARNED A FEW TRICKS IT IS MERELY A MATTER OF GLIDING CLOSE TO THE GROUND SELECTING THE BEST SHADOWS AND KEEPING A SHARP LOOKOUT
2531-156724-0030 AND UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS I CAN DO IT QUITE SAFELY THE QUESTION NOW IS HOW WILL YOU KNOW WHEN I HAVE ARRIVED THAT MY BOY IS THE NUB OR CRUX OF THE SITUATION A DIFFICULT PROBLEM YOU WILL ADMIT BUT I HAVE WORKED OUT THE SOLUTION
2531-156724-0031 THE PHOENIX LOWERED ITS VOICE IMPRESSIVELY MY BOY WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL THIS BELL IN YOUR ROOM AND THE PUSHBUTTON ON THE BASE OF THAT TELEPHONE POLE
2531-156724-0032 IT DID NOT SEEM VERY PRACTICAL TO DAVID WELL PHOENIX THAT'S A GOOD IDEA HE SAID CAREFULLY BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO HIDE THE WIRES AND WHAT ABOUT THE NOISE OF THE BELL NOTHING TO IT MY BOY THE WIRES
2531-156724-0033 JUST IMAGINE IT THE PHOENIX CONTINUED ENTHUSIASTICALLY PERHAPS LATER WE CAN INSTALL ANOTHER BELL AT THIS END THEN WE COULD LEARN MORSE CODE AND SEND MESSAGES TO EACH OTHER EXACTLY LIKE A PRIVATE TELEPHONE LINE
2531-156724-0034 PUT IN THIS WAY THE IDEA HAD A CERTAIN APPEAL AND DAVID FOUND HIMSELF WARMING TO IT BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER HOW ABOUT ELECTRICITY PHOENIX LOOK ABOVE YOU MY BOY
2531-156724-0035 THE TELEPHONE POLE IS SIMPLY LOADED DOWN WITH POWER LINES WAITING TO BE TAPPED THE PHOENIX WAS EVIDENTLY SET ON CARRYING OUT THE PLAN AND DAVID DID NOT WANT TO WEAR OUT THE BIRD'S PATIENCE WITH MORE OBJECTIONS AND WELL WHY NOT
2531-156724-0036 THERE SHOULD BE NO HARM IN TRYING IT OUT ANYWAY THEY GATHERED UP THE TOOLS AND WALKED ALONG THE HEDGE TO THE TELEPHONE POLE WHICH WAS IN ONE CORNER OF THE YARD THE PHOENIX BEGAN TO UNCOIL THE WIRE
2531-156724-0037 WHILE DAVID GAZED UP DOUBTFULLY AT THE SHADOWY MAZE OF LINES AND INSULATORS ON THE CROSS ARMS ELECTRICITY SAID THE PHOENIX THOUGHTFULLY IS A COMPLICATED AND PROFOUND SUBJECT
2531-156724-0038 TO THE TOP OF THE POLE DAVID COULD HEAR THE CREAK OF THE LINES UNDER THE PHOENIX'S WEIGHT AND THE RATTLING OF THE SCREW DRIVER AGAINST THE PORCELAIN INSULATORS FOR SOME MINUTES THE PHOENIX INVESTIGATED CLICKING AND SCRAPING ABOUT AND MUTTERING QUITE SO AND THERE WE ARE
2531-156724-0039 THE COVERING ON THE LINES IS RATHER TOUGH HOWEVER WE SHALL HAVE TO USE THE WIRE CUTTERS THE PHOENIX RETURNED TO THE TOP OF THE POLE WITH THE CUTTERS AND WORKED ON THE WIRES FOR FIVE MORE MINUTES BITS OF DEBRIS BEGAN TO SHOWER DOWN ON THE HEDGE
2531-156724-0040 WHERE IS OUR WIRE AH THERE WE ARE THE PLIERS PLEASE DO YOU NEED ANY HELP UP THERE DAVID ASKED NO EVERYTHING IS COMING ALONG BEAUTIFULLY THANK YOU I SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING FINISHED IN A FLASH TRAILING ONE END OF THE WIRE IN ITS BEAK
2531-156724-0041 THE PHOENIX FLEW UP INTO THE DARKNESS ONCE MORE THE TINKERING SOUNDS BEGAN AGAIN AND A SPURT OF FALLING DEBRIS RATTLED IN THE LEAVES OF THE HEDGE SUDDENLY IT HAPPENED
2531-156724-0042 AND A SHOWER OF SPARKS ANOTHER BLUE FLASH BLAZED UP THE LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE AND DOWN THE WHOLE STREET FLICKERED AND WENT OUT IN THE BLACKNESS WHICH FOLLOWED EACH STAGE OF THE PHOENIX'S DESCENT COULD BE HEARD AS CLEARLY AS CANNON SHOTS
2531-156724-0043 THE TWANGING AND SNAPPING AS IT TUMBLED THROUGH THE WIRES A DRAWN OUT SQUAWK AND THE FLOP OF WINGS IN THE AIR BELOW THE CRASH INTO THE HEDGE THE JARRING THUD AGAINST THE GROUND BROKEN WIRES BEGAN TO SPUTTER OMINOUSLY AND FIRE OUT SPARKS
2531-156724-0044 THE PHOENIX BEAT AT THE SMOLDERING SPARKS IN ITS TAIL AND FLEW OFF LEAVING A TRAIL OF ACRID SMOKE HANGING IN THE AIR DAVID HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO GATHER UP ALL THE TOOLS THE WIRE BELL AND PUSHBUTTON
2531-156724-0045 AND ONE OF THE PHOENIX'S FEATHERS WHICH HAD BEEN TORN OUT DURING THE FALL HE SLIPPED THROUGH A CELLAR WINDOW HID THE EQUIPMENT UNDER A STACK OF OLD BOXES AND RAN NOISILY UP THE STAIRS INTO THE KITCHEN HEY HE SHOUTED THE LIGHTS ARE OUT
2531-156724-0046 TURNING OUT ALL THE LIGHTS SO HE CAN MURDER US IN OUR BEDS LOOK DAVID SHOUTED THE LINE'S BROKEN IN OUR BACK YARD THEY COULD HEAR THE WAILING OF SIRENS NOW FIRE TRUCKS REPAIR TRUCKS
2531-156724-0047 AND POLICE CARS PULLED UP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE EVERYONE IN THE BLOCK TURNED OUT TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED IT TOOK THE REPAIR MEN AN HOUR TO UNTANGLE THE WIRES AND FIX THEM
