5606-54667-0000 AND INQUIRED WHETHER HE SHOULD TELL HER THAT I HAD COME IN I DESIRED HIM NOT TO DISTURB HER AS IT WAS MY INTENTION TO GO OUT AGAIN IMMEDIATELY I WENT INTO MY STUDY AND WROTE A SHORT NOTE THERE TO CLARA MERELY TELLING HER THAT I SHOULD BE ABSENT IN THE COUNTRY FOR TWO DAYS
5606-54667-0001 AND WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN I HEARD THE LIBRARY DOOR OPEN I INSTANTLY DREW BACK AND HALF CLOSED MY OWN DOOR AGAIN CLARA HAD GOT THE BOOK SHE WANTED AND WAS TAKING IT UP TO HER OWN SITTING ROOM
5606-54667-0002 I WAITED TILL SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN LEFT THE HOUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER AVOIDED MY SISTER MY SISTER WHO HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE ASKED A QUESTION OR UTTERED A WORD THAT COULD ANNOY ME MY SISTER WHO HAD CONFIDED
5606-54667-0003 AS I THOUGHT ON WHAT I HAD DONE I FELT A SENSE OF HUMILIATION WHICH WAS ALMOST PUNISHMENT ENOUGH FOR THE MEANNESS OF WHICH I HAD BEEN GUILTY I WENT ROUND TO THE STABLES AND HAD MY HORSE SADDLED IMMEDIATELY
5606-54667-0004 NO IDEA OF PROCEEDING IN ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION OCCURRED TO ME I SIMPLY FELT RESOLVED TO PASS MY TWO DAYS ORDEAL OF SUSPENSE AWAY FROM HOME FAR ENOUGH AWAY TO KEEP ME FAITHFUL TO MY PROMISE NOT TO SEE MARGARET SOON AFTER I STARTED
5606-54667-0005 I LEFT MY HORSE TO HIS OWN GUIDANCE AND GAVE MYSELF UP TO MY THOUGHTS AND RECOLLECTIONS AS ONE BY ONE THEY ROSE WITHIN ME THE ANIMAL TOOK THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD BEEN OFTENEST USED TO TAKE DURING MY RESIDENCE IN LONDON THE NORTHERN ROAD
5606-54667-0006 IT WAS NOT UNTIL I HAD RIDDEN HALF A MILE BEYOND THE SUBURBS THAT I LOOKED ROUND ME AND DISCOVERED TOWARDS WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY I WAS PROCEEDING I DREW THE REIN DIRECTLY AND TURNED MY HORSE'S HEAD BACK AGAIN
5606-54667-0007 TO FOLLOW THE FAVOURITE ROAD WHICH I HAD SO OFTEN FOLLOWED WITH CLARA TO STOP PERHAPS AT SOME PLACE WHERE I HAD OFTEN STOPPED WITH HER WAS MORE THAN I HAD THE COURAGE OR THE INSENSIBILITY TO DO AT THAT MOMENT
5606-54667-0008 I RODE AS FAR AS EWELL AND STOPPED THERE THE DARKNESS HAD OVERTAKEN ME AND IT WAS USELESS TO TIRE MY HORSE BY GOING ON ANY GREATER DISTANCE THE NEXT MORNING I WAS UP ALMOST WITH SUNRISE AND PASSED THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY IN WALKING ABOUT AMONG VILLAGES LANES AND FIELDS
5606-54667-0009 JUST AS CHANCE LED ME DURING THE NIGHT MANY THOUGHTS THAT I HAD BANISHED FOR THE LAST WEEK HAD RETURNED THOSE THOUGHTS OF EVIL OMEN UNDER WHICH THE MIND SEEMS TO ACHE JUST AS THE BODY ACHES UNDER A DULL HEAVY PAIN
5606-54667-0010 TO WHICH WE CAN ASSIGN NO PARTICULAR PLACE OR CAUSE ABSENT FROM MARGARET I HAD NO RESOURCE AGAINST THE OPPRESSION THAT NOW OVERCAME ME I COULD ONLY ENDEAVOUR TO ALLEVIATE IT BY KEEPING INCESSANTLY IN ACTION BY WALKING OR RIDING
5606-54667-0011 BESIDES WHAT I HAD OBSERVED OF MARGARET'S FATHER ESPECIALLY DURING THE LATTER PART OF MY INTERVIEW WITH HIM SHOWED ME PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT HE WAS TRYING TO CONCEAL UNDER EXAGGERATED SURPRISE AND ASSUMED HESITATION HIS SECRET DESIRE TO PROFIT AT ONCE BY MY OFFER
5606-54667-0012 WHICH WHATEVER CONDITIONS MIGHT CLOG IT WAS INFINITELY MORE ADVANTAGEOUS IN A SOCIAL POINT OF VIEW THAN ANY HE COULD HAVE HOPED FOR IT WAS NOT HIS DELAY IN ACCEPTING MY PROPOSALS BUT THE BURDEN OF DECEIT
5606-54667-0013 THE FETTERS OF CONCEALMENT FORCED ON ME BY THE PROPOSALS THEMSELVES WHICH NOW HUNG HEAVY ON MY HEART THAT EVENING I LEFT EWELL AND RODE TOWARDS HOME AGAIN AS FAR AS RICHMOND WHERE I REMAINED FOR THE NIGHT AND THE FOREPART OF THE NEXT DAY
5606-54667-0014 I REACHED LONDON IN THE AFTERNOON AND GOT TO NORTH VILLA WITHOUT GOING HOME FIRST ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK THE OPPRESSION WAS STILL ON MY SPIRITS EVEN THE SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE MARGARET LIVED FAILED TO INVIGORATE OR AROUSE ME
5606-54667-0015 ON THIS OCCASION WHEN I WAS SHOWN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM BOTH MISTER AND MISSUS SHERWIN WERE AWAITING ME THERE ON THE TABLE WAS THE SHERRY WHICH HAD BEEN SO PERSEVERINGLY PRESSED ON ME AT THE LAST INTERVIEW AND BY IT A NEW POUND CAKE
5606-54667-0016 MISSUS SHERWIN WAS CUTTING THE CAKE AS I CAME IN WHILE HER HUSBAND WATCHED THE PROCESS WITH CRITICAL EYES THE POOR WOMAN'S WEAK WHITE FINGERS TREMBLED AS THEY MOVED THE KNIFE UNDER CONJUGAL INSPECTION
5606-54667-0017 MOST HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN MOST HAPPY INDEED MY DEAR SIR SAID MISTER SHERWIN ADVANCING WITH HOSPITABLE SMILE AND OUTSTRETCHED HAND ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MY BETTER HALF MISSUS S HIS WIFE ROSE IN A HURRY AND CURTSEYED
5606-54667-0018 LEAVING THE KNIFE STICKING IN THE CAKE UPON WHICH MISTER SHERWIN WITH A STERN LOOK AT HER OSTENTATIOUSLY PULLED IT OUT AND SET IT DOWN RATHER VIOLENTLY ON THE DISH POOR MISSUS SHERWIN
5606-54667-0019 I HAD HARDLY NOTICED HER ON THE DAY WHEN SHE GOT INTO THE OMNIBUS WITH HER DAUGHTER IT WAS AS IF I NOW SAW HER FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE IS A NATURAL COMMUNICATIVENESS ABOUT WOMEN'S EMOTIONS A HAPPY WOMAN
5606-54667-0020 IMPERCEPTIBLY DIFFUSES HER HAPPINESS AROUND HER SHE HAS AN INFLUENCE THAT IS SOMETHING AKIN TO THE INFLUENCE OF A SUNSHINY DAY SO AGAIN THE MELANCHOLY OF A MELANCHOLY WOMAN IS INVARIABLY THOUGH SILENTLY INFECTIOUS
5606-54667-0021 AND MISSUS SHERWIN WAS ONE OF THIS LATTER ORDER HER PALE SICKLY MOIST LOOKING SKIN HER LARGE MILD WATERY LIGHT BLUE EYES THE RESTLESS TIMIDITY OF HER EXPRESSION
5606-54667-0022 THE MIXTURE OF USELESS HESITATION AND INVOLUNTARY RAPIDITY IN EVERY ONE OF HER ACTIONS ALL FURNISHED THE SAME SIGNIFICANT BETRAYAL OF A LIFE OF INCESSANT FEAR AND RESTRAINT
5606-54667-0023 OF A DISPOSITION FULL OF MODEST GENEROSITIES AND MEEK SYMPATHIES WHICH HAD BEEN CRUSHED DOWN PAST ROUSING TO SELF ASSERTION PAST EVER SEEING THE LIGHT THERE IN THAT MILD WAN FACE OF HERS
5606-54667-0024 IN THOSE PAINFUL STARTINGS AND HURRYINGS WHEN SHE MOVED IN THAT TREMULOUS FAINT UTTERANCE WHEN SHE SPOKE THERE I COULD SEE ONE OF THOSE GHASTLY HEART TRAGEDIES LAID OPEN BEFORE ME WHICH ARE ACTED AND RE ACTED SCENE BY SCENE
5606-54667-0025 IN THE SECRET THEATRE OF HOME TRAGEDIES WHICH ARE EVER SHADOWED BY THE SLOW FALLING OF THE BLACK CURTAIN THAT DROPS LOWER AND LOWER EVERY DAY THAT DROPS TO HIDE ALL AT LAST FROM THE HAND OF DEATH
5606-54667-0026 SAID MISSUS SHERWIN ALMOST INAUDIBLY LOOKING AS SHE SPOKE WITH ANXIOUS EYES TOWARDS HER HUSBAND TO SEE IF SHE WAS JUSTIFIED IN UTTERING EVEN THOSE PITEOUSLY COMMON PLACE WORDS VERY BEAUTIFUL WEATHER TO BE SURE CONTINUED THE POOR WOMAN
5606-54667-0027 AND HAD BEEN ORDERED TO SAY HER FIRST LESSON IN A STRANGER'S PRESENCE DELIGHTFUL WEATHER MISSUS SHERWIN I HAVE BEEN ENJOYING IT FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS IN THE COUNTRY IN A PART OF SURREY THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF EWELL THAT I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE THERE WAS A PAUSE
5606-54667-0028 MISTER SHERWIN COUGHED IT WAS EVIDENTLY A WARNING MATRIMONIAL PEAL THAT HE HAD OFTEN RUNG BEFORE FOR MISSUS SHERWIN STARTED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM DIRECTLY
5606-54667-0029 AS THE LADY OF THE HOUSE MISSUS S IT STRIKES ME THAT YOU MIGHT OFFER A VISITOR LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN SOME CAKE AND WINE WITHOUT MAKING ANY PARTICULAR HOLE IN YOUR MANNERS
5606-54667-0030 THAT THE DECANTER TINKLED ALL THE WHILE AGAINST THE GLASS THOUGH I WANTED NOTHING I ATE AND DRANK SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY IN COMMON CONSIDERATION FOR MISSUS SHERWIN'S EMBARRASSMENT MISTER SHERWIN FILLED HIMSELF A GLASS HELD IT UP ADMIRINGLY TO THE LIGHT
5606-54667-0031 SAID YOUR GOOD HEALTH SIR YOUR VERY GOOD HEALTH
5606-54667-0032 HIS WIFE TO WHOM HE OFFERED NOTHING LOOKED AT HIM ALL THE TIME WITH THE MOST REVERENTIAL ATTENTION YOU ARE TAKING NOTHING YOURSELF MISSUS SHERWIN I SAID
5606-54667-0033 THIS SHERRY STANDS ME IN SIX SHILLINGS A BOTTLE OUGHT TO BE FIRST RATE WINE AT THAT PRICE AND SO IT IS WELL IF YOU WON'T HAVE ANY MORE WE WILL PROCEED TO BUSINESS HA HA BUSINESS AS I CALL IT
5606-54667-0034 MISSUS SHERWIN COUGHED A VERY WEAK SMALL COUGH HALF STIFLED IN ITS BIRTH
5606-54667-0035 WELL SIR THE EVENING AFTER YOU LEFT ME I HAD WHAT YOU MAY CALL AN EXPLANATION WITH MY DEAR GIRL
5606-54667-0036 HERE MISSUS SHERWIN PUT HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES QUITE NOISELESSLY FOR SHE HAD DOUBTLESS ACQUIRED BY LONG PRACTICE THE HABIT OF WEEPING IN SILENCE HER HUSBAND'S QUICK GLANCE TURNED ON HER HOWEVER IMMEDIATELY
5606-54667-0037 HE SAID INDIGNANTLY WHAT IS THERE TO CRY ABOUT
5606-54667-0038 THIS IS A MOST ANNOYING CIRCUMSTANCE AND BEFORE A VISITOR TOO YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME TO DISCUSS THE MATTER ALONE YOU ALWAYS WERE IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS AND IT'S MY OPINION YOU ALWAYS WILL BE MISSUS SHERWIN PREPARED WITHOUT A WORD OF REMONSTRANCE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
5606-54667-0039 I SINCERELY FELT FOR HER BUT COULD SAY NOTHING IN THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT I ROSE TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR HER AND IMMEDIATELY REPENTED HAVING DONE SO THE ACTION ADDED SO MUCH TO HER EMBARRASSMENT THAT SHE KICKED HER FOOT AGAINST A CHAIR
5606-54667-0040 MISTER SHERWIN HELPED HIMSELF TO A SECOND GLASS OF WINE WITHOUT TAKING THE SMALLEST NOTICE OF THIS I HOPE MISSUS SHERWIN HAS NOT HURT HERSELF I SAID OH DEAR NO NOT WORTH A MOMENT'S THOUGHT AWKWARDNESS AND NERVOUSNESS NOTHING ELSE SHE ALWAYS WAS NERVOUS THE DOCTORS ALL HUMBUGS
5606-54667-0041 CAN DO NOTHING WITH HER IT'S VERY SAD VERY SAD INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT BY THIS TIME IN SPITE OF ALL MY EFFORTS TO PRESERVE SOME RESPECT FOR HIM AS MARGARET'S FATHER HE HAD SUNK TO HIS PROPER PLACE IN MY ESTIMATION WELL MY DEAR SIR HE RESUMED
