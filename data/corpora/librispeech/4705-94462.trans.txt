4705-94462-0000 UP TO THIS POINT IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE SCIENCE BY THE STATEMENT OF HIGHLY ABSTRACT GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH WE HAVE REACHED BY PURELY METAPHYSICAL REASONING WE NOW PASS ON TO THE CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN NATURAL LAWS
4705-94462-0001 WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BY A LONG SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS THE FULL MEANING AND IMPORTANCE OF WHICH WILL BECOME CLEAR WHEN WE SEE THEIR APPLICATION TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH HAVE HITHERTO OCCUPIED OUR ATTENTION THE PHENOMENA OF HYPNOSIS
4705-94462-0002 ARE NOW SO FULLY RECOGNIZED AS ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC FACTS THAT IT IS QUITE SUPERFLUOUS TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF THEIR CREDIBILITY TWO GREAT MEDICAL SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN FOUNDED UPON THEM AND IN SOME COUNTRIES
4705-94462-0003 THEY HAVE BECOME THE SUBJECT OF SPECIAL LEGISLATION THE QUESTION BEFORE US AT THE PRESENT DAY IS NOT AS TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE FACTS BUT AS TO THE PROPER INFERENCES TO BE DRAWN FROM THEM AND A CORRECT APPREHENSION OF THESE INFERENCES
4705-94462-0004 IS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE AIDS TO THE MENTAL SCIENTIST FOR IT CONFIRMS THE CONCLUSIONS OF PURELY A PRIORI REASONING BY AN ARRAY OF EXPERIMENTAL INSTANCES WHICH PLACES THE CORRECTNESS OF THOSE CONCLUSIONS BEYOND DOUBT THE GREAT TRUTH
4705-94462-0005 WHICH THE SCIENCE OF HYPNOTISM HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT IS THE DUAL NATURE OF THE HUMAN MIND MUCH CONFLICT EXISTS BETWEEN DIFFERENT WRITERS AS TO WHETHER THIS DUALITY RESULTS FROM THE PRESENCE OF TWO ACTUALLY SEPARATE MINDS IN THE ONE MAN
4705-94462-0006 OR IN THE ACTION OF THE SAME MIND IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DISTINCTIONS WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE WHICH ARE SO PROLIFIC A SOURCE OF HINDRANCE TO THE OPENING OUT OF TRUTH
4705-94462-0007 ON THE THREAD OF HIS ONE INDIVIDUALITY AND EACH ADAPTED TO A PARTICULAR USE OR AS VARIED FUNCTIONS OF A SINGLE MIND IN EITHER CASE WE ARE DEALING WITH A SINGLE INDIVIDUALITY AND HOW WE MAY PICTURE THE WHEEL WORK OF THE MENTAL MECHANISM
4705-94462-0008 HOME TO US MOST CLEARLY THEREFORE AS A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE I SHALL IN THESE LECTURES SPEAK OF THIS DUAL ACTION AS THOUGH IT PROCEEDED FROM TWO MINDS AN OUTER AND AN INNER
4705-94462-0009 SOME OF THEM MEN OF WORLD WIDE REPUTATION HAS FULLY ESTABLISHED CERTAIN REMARKABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTION OF THE SUBJECTIVE AND THAT OF THE OBJECTIVE MIND WHICH MAY BE BRIEFLY STATED AS FOLLOWS
4705-94462-0010 THE SUBJECTIVE MIND IS ONLY ABLE TO REASON DEDUCTIVELY AND NOT INDUCTIVELY WHILE THE OBJECTIVE MIND CAN DO BOTH DEDUCTIVE REASONING IS THE PURE SYLLOGISM WHICH SHOWS WHY A THIRD PROPOSITION MUST NECESSARILY RESULT
4705-94462-0011 WHETHER THE TWO INITIAL STATEMENTS ARE TRUE OR NOT TO DETERMINE THIS IS THE PROVINCE OF INDUCTIVE REASONING WHICH DRAWS ITS CONCLUSIONS FROM THE OBSERVATION OF A SERIES OF FACTS THE RELATION OF THE TWO MODES OF REASONING IS THAT
4705-94462-0012 FIRST BY OBSERVING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF INSTANCES WE INDUCTIVELY REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT A CERTAIN PRINCIPLE IS OF GENERAL APPLICATION AND THEN WE ENTER UPON THE DEDUCTIVE PROCESS BY ASSUMING THE TRUTH OF THIS PRINCIPLE
4705-94462-0013 AND DETERMINING WHAT RESULT MUST FOLLOW IN A PARTICULAR CASE ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF ITS TRUTH THUS DEDUCTIVE REASONING PROCEEDS ON THE ASSUMPTION OF THE CORRECTNESS OF CERTAIN HYPOTHESES OR SUPPOSITIONS WITH WHICH IT SETS OUT
4705-94462-0014 IT IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE TRUTH OR FALSITY OF THOSE SUPPOSITIONS BUT ONLY WITH THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT RESULTS MUST NECESSARILY FOLLOW SUPPOSING THEM TO BE TRUE INDUCTIVE REASONING ON THE OTHER HAND
4705-94462-0015 IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE COMPARE A NUMBER OF SEPARATE INSTANCES WITH ONE ANOTHER UNTIL WE SEE THE COMMON FACTOR THAT GIVES RISE TO THEM ALL INDUCTION PROCEEDS BY THE COMPARISON OF FACTS AND DEDUCTION BY THE APPLICATION OF UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES
4705-94462-0016 WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO THE INDUCTIVE PROCESS BUT WILL ACCEPT ANY SUGGESTION HOWEVER FALSE BUT HAVING ONCE ACCEPTED ANY SUGGESTION IT IS STRICTLY LOGICAL IN DEDUCING THE PROPER CONCLUSIONS FROM IT
4705-94462-0017 AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SUBJECTIVE MIND IS ENTIRELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE OBJECTIVE MIND WITH THE UTMOST FIDELITY IT REPRODUCES AND WORKS OUT TO ITS FINAL CONSEQUENCES WHATEVER THE OBJECTIVE MIND IMPRESSES UPON IT
4705-94462-0018 AND THE FACTS OF HYPNOTISM SHOW THAT IDEAS CAN BE IMPRESSED ON THE SUBJECTIVE MIND BY THE OBJECTIVE MIND OF ANOTHER AS WELL AS BY THAT OF ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY THIS IS A MOST IMPORTANT POINT FOR IT IS ON THIS AMENABILITY TO SUGGESTION BY THE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER
4705-94462-0019 HE IS A SWIMMER BREASTING THE WAVES A BIRD FLYING IN THE AIR A SOLDIER IN THE TUMULT OF BATTLE AN INDIAN STEALTHILY TRACKING HIS VICTIM IN SHORT FOR THE TIME BEING
4705-94462-0020 BY THE WILL OF THE OPERATOR AND ACTS THE PART WITH INIMITABLE ACCURACY BUT THE EXPERIMENTS OF HYPNOTISM GO FURTHER THAN THIS AND SHOW THE EXISTENCE IN THE SUBJECTIVE MIND
4705-94462-0021 THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE PHYSICAL SENSES POWERS OF THOUGHT READING OF THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE AND THE LIKE ALL OF WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY MANIFESTED WHEN THE PATIENT IS BROUGHT INTO THE HIGHER MESMERIC STATE
4705-94462-0022 THAT THE CONTROL MUST BE OUR OWN AND NOT THAT OF ANY EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE WHETHER IN THE FLESH OR OUT OF IT BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT WHICH HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED IS THAT THE SUBJECTIVE MIND IS THE BUILDER OF THE BODY
4705-94462-0023 THE SUBJECTIVE ENTITY IN THE PATIENT IS ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE CHARACTER OF THE DISEASE FROM WHICH HE IS SUFFERING AND TO POINT OUT SUITABLE REMEDIES INDICATING A PHYSIOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE EXCEEDING THAT OF THE MOST HIGHLY TRAINED PHYSICIANS
4705-94462-0024 AND ALSO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODILY ORGANS AND THE MATERIAL REMEDIES WHICH CAN AFFORD RELIEF AND FROM THIS IT IS BUT A STEP FURTHER TO THOSE NUMEROUS INSTANCES
4705-94462-0025 IN WHICH IT ENTIRELY DISPENSES WITH THE USE OF MATERIAL REMEDIES AND ITSELF WORKS DIRECTLY ON THE ORGANISM SO THAT COMPLETE RESTORATION TO HEALTH FOLLOWS AS THE RESULT OF THE SUGGESTIONS OF PERFECT SOUNDNESS
4705-94462-0026 MADE BY THE OPERATOR TO THE PATIENT WHILE IN THE HYPNOTIC STATE
4705-94462-0027 PROCEEDS FROM ITS ASSOCIATION WITH THE PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE MIND OF ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY WHATEVER PERSONALITY THE OBJECTIVE MIND IMPRESSES UPON IT THAT PERSONALITY IT ASSUMES AND ACTS UP TO AND SINCE IT IS THE BUILDER OF THE BODY
4705-94462-0028 THESE TWO LAWS OF THE SUBJECTIVE MIND FORM THE FOUNDATION OF THE AXIOM THAT OUR BODY REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE OF OUR BELIEFS IF OUR FIXED BELIEF IS THAT THE BODY IS SUBJECT TO ALL SORTS OF INFLUENCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND THAT THIS THAT
4705-94462-0029 OR THE OTHER SYMPTOM SHOWS THAT SUCH AN UNCONTROLLABLE INFLUENCE IS AT WORK UPON US THEN THIS BELIEF IS IMPRESSED UPON THE SUBJECTIVE MIND WHICH BY THE LAW OF ITS NATURE ACCEPTS IT WITHOUT QUESTION
4705-94462-0030 AND PROCEEDS TO FASHION BODILY CONDITIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS BELIEF AGAIN IF OUR FIXED BELIEF IS THAT CERTAIN MATERIAL REMEDIES ARE THE ONLY MEANS OF CURE THEN WE FIND IN THIS BELIEF THE FOUNDATION OF ALL MEDICINE
4705-94462-0031 THERE IS NOTHING UNSOUND IN THE THEORY OF MEDICINE IT IS THE STRICTLY LOGICAL CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE MEASURE OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH THOSE WHO RELY ON IT ARE AS YET ABLE TO ASSIMILATE AND IT ACTS ACCURATELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR BELIEF
4705-94462-0032 THAT IN A LARGE NUMBER OF CASES MEDICINE WILL DO GOOD BUT ALSO IN MANY INSTANCES IT FAILS THEREFORE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET REACHED A MORE INTERIOR PERCEPTION OF THE LAW OF NATURE THE HEALING AGENCY OF MEDICINE IS A MOST VALUABLE AID
4705-94462-0033 TO THE ALLEVIATION OF PHYSICAL MALADIES THE ERROR TO BE COMBATED IS NOT THE BELIEF THAT IN ITS OWN WAY MEDICINE IS CAPABLE OF DOING GOOD BUT THE BELIEF THAT THERE IS NO HIGHER OR BETTER WAY THEN ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE
4705-94462-0034 AND THAT THE BODY IS SUBJECT TO NO INFLUENCES EXCEPT THOSE WHICH REACH IT THROUGH THE SUBJECTIVE MIND THEN WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS TO IMPRESS THIS UPON THE SUBJECTIVE MIND AND HABITUALLY THINK OF IT AS A FOUNTAIN OF PERPETUAL LIFE
4705-94462-0035 IN THE MOST COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE OF ANY INFLUENCES OF ANY SORT SAVE THOSE OF OUR OWN DESIRE IMPRESSED UPON OUR OWN SUBJECTIVE MIND BY OUR OWN THOUGHT WHEN ONCE WE FULLY GRASP THESE CONSIDERATIONS
4705-94462-0036 WE SHALL SEE THAT IT IS JUST AS EASY TO EXTERNALIZE HEALTHY CONDITIONS OF BODY AS THE CONTRARY PRACTICALLY THE PROCESS AMOUNTS TO A BELIEF IN OUR OWN POWER OF LIFE AND SINCE THIS BELIEF
4705-94462-0037 IF IT BE THOROUGHLY DOMICILED WITHIN US WILL NECESSARILY PRODUCE A CORRESPONDINGLY HEALTHY BODY WE SHOULD SPARE NO PAINS TO CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT THERE ARE SOUND AND REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR HOLDING IT
