6549-71114-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR NIGHT AND STORM THE HEAVENS WERE GROWING VERY DARK THE WIND WAS RISING AND DRIVING BLACK CLOUDS ATHWART THE SKY THE ATMOSPHERE WAS BECOMING PIERCINGLY COLD THE SNOW
6549-71114-0001 THAT DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY HAD THAWED WAS FREEZING HARD YET MARIAN HURRIED FEARLESSLY AND GAYLY ON OVER THE RUGGED AND SLIPPERY STUBBLE FIELDS THAT LAY BETWEEN THE COTTAGE AND THE BEACH A RAPID WALK OF FIFTEEN MINUTES
6549-71114-0002 BROUGHT HER DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BUT IT WAS NOW QUITE DARK NOTHING COULD BE MORE DESERTED LONELY AND DESOLATE THAN THE ASPECT OF THIS PLACE FROM HER FEET THE BLACK WATERS SPREAD OUTWARD
6549-71114-0003 TILL THEIR UTMOST BOUNDARIES WERE LOST AMONG THE BLACKER VAPORS OF THE DISTANT HORIZON AFAR OFF A SAIL DIMLY SEEN OR GUESSED AT GLIDED GHOST LIKE THROUGH THE SHADOWS LANDWARD THE BOUNDARIES OF FIELD AND FOREST
6549-71114-0004 HILL AND VALE WERE ALL BLENDED FUSED IN MURKY OBSCURITY HEAVENWARD THE LOWERING SKY WAS DARKENED BY WILD SCUDDING BLACK CLOUDS DRIVEN BY THE WIND THROUGH WHICH THE YOUNG MOON SEEMED PLUNGING
6549-71114-0005 AND HIDING AS IN TERROR THE TIDE WAS COMING IN AND THE WAVES SURGED HEAVILY WITH A DEEP MOAN UPON THE BEACH NOT A SOUND WAS HEARD EXCEPT THE DULL MONOTONOUS MOAN OF THE SEA AND THE FITFUL
6549-71114-0006 HOLLOW WAIL OF THE WIND THE CHARACTER OF THE SCENE WAS IN THE LAST DEGREE WILD DREARY GLOOMY AND FEARFUL NOT SO HOWEVER IT SEEMED TO MARIAN WHO FILLED WITH HAPPY GENEROUS
6549-71114-0007 AND TUMULTUOUS THOUGHTS WAS SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF THE GATHERING DARKNESS AND THE LOWERING STORM AS SHE WALKED UP AND DOWN UPON THE BEACH LISTENING AND WAITING SHE WONDERED THAT THURSTON HAD NOT BEEN THERE READY TO RECEIVE HER
6549-71114-0008 BUT THIS THOUGHT GAVE HER LITTLE UNEASINESS IT WAS NEARLY LOST AS THE STORM AND DARKNESS ALSO WERE IN THE BRIGHTNESS AND GLADNESS OF HER OWN LOVING GENEROUS EMOTIONS THERE WAS NO ROOM IN HER HEART FOR DOUBT OR TROUBLE
6549-71114-0009 IF THE THOUGHT OF THE MORNING'S CONVERSATION AND OF ANGELICA ENTERED HER MIND IT WAS ONLY TO BE SOON DISMISSED WITH FAIR CONSTRUCTION AND CHEERFUL HOPE AND THEN SHE PICTURED TO HERSELF THE SURPRISE THE PLEASURE OF THURSTON
6549-71114-0010 WHICH SHOULD SET THEM BOTH FREE TO PURSUE THEIR INCLINATIONS AND PLANS FOR THEIR OWN HAPPINESS AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS AND SHE SOUGHT IN HER BOSOM IF THE LETTERS WERE SAFE YES THERE THEY WERE SHE FELT THEM
6549-71114-0011 HER HAPPINESS HAD SEEMED A DREAM WITHOUT THAT PROOF OF ITS REALITY FOR ONCE SHE GAVE WAY TO IMAGINATION AND ALLOWED THAT MAGICIAN TO BUILD CASTLES IN THE AIR AT WILL
6549-71114-0012 THURSTON AND HERSELF MUST GO TO ENGLAND IMMEDIATELY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE ESTATE THAT WAS CERTAIN THEN THEY MUST RETURN BUT ERE THAT SHE WOULD CONFIDE TO HIM HER DARLING PROJECT ONE
6549-71114-0013 ONE THAT SHE HAD LONGINGLY DREAMED OF BUT NEVER AS NOW HOPED TO REALIZE AND EDITH SHE WOULD MAKE EDITH SO COMFORTABLE EDITH SHOULD BE AGAIN SURROUNDED WITH THE ELEGANCIES AND REFINEMENTS OF LIFE
6549-71114-0014 AND MIRIAM MIRIAM SHOULD HAVE EVERY ADVANTAGE OF EDUCATION THAT WEALTH COULD POSSIBLY SECURE FOR HER EITHER IN THIS COUNTRY OR IN EUROPE IF EDITH WOULD SPARE MIRIAM
6549-71114-0015 ABOVE ALL THURSTON A HEAVY DROP OF RAIN STRUCK MARIAN IN THE FACE AND FOR AN INSTANT WOKE HER FROM HER BLISSFUL REVERIE SHE LOOKED UP WHY DID NOT THURSTON COME
6549-71114-0016 THE STORM WOULD SOON BURST FORTH UPON THE EARTH
6549-71114-0017 WERE HE BY HER SIDE THERE WOULD BE NOTHING FORMIDABLE IN THE STORM FOR HE WOULD SHELTER HER WITH HIS CLOAK AND UMBRELLA AS THEY SHOULD SCUD ALONG OVER THE FIELDS TO THE COTTAGE AND REACH THE FIRESIDE BEFORE THE RAIN COULD OVERTAKE THEM
6549-71114-0018 WHAT COULD DETAIN HIM AT SUCH A TIME SHE PEERED THROUGH THE DARKNESS UP AND DOWN THE BEACH TO HER ACCUSTOMED EYE THE FEATURES OF THE LANDSCAPE WERE DIMLY VISIBLE THAT BLACK FORM LOOMING LIKE A SHADOWY GIANT BEFORE HER
6549-71114-0019 WAS THE HEADLAND OF PINE BLUFF WITH ITS BASE WASHED BY THE SULLEN WAVES
6549-71114-0020 SHE LISTENED THE MOAN OF THE SEA THE WAIL OF THE WIND WERE BLENDED IN MOURNFUL CHORUS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND THAT BROKE THE DREARY SILENCE OF THE HOUR HARK NO THERE WAS ANOTHER SOUND
6549-71114-0021 AMID THE MOANING AND THE WAILING OF WINDS AND WAVES AND THE GROANING OF THE COMING STORM WAS HEARD THE REGULAR FALL OF OARS SOON FOLLOWED BY THE SLOW GRATING SOUND OF A BOAT
6549-71114-0022 MARIAN PAUSED AND STRAINED HER EYES THROUGH THE DARKNESS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND BUT COULD SEE NOTHING SAVE THE DEEPER DENSER DARKNESS AROUND PINE BLUFF SHE TURNED
6549-71114-0023 AND UNDER COVER OF THE DARKNESS MOVED SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY FROM THE LOCALITY THE STORM WAS COMING ON VERY FAST THE RAIN WAS FALLING AND THE WIND RISING AND DRIVING IT INTO HER FACE
6549-71114-0024 AND WRAPPED HER SHAWL TIGHTLY ABOUT HER AS SHE MET THE BLAST OH WHERE WAS THURSTON AND WHY DID HE NOT COME SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HAVING VENTURED OUT YET COULD SHE HAVE FORESEEN THIS NO
6549-71114-0025 FOR SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY TRUSTED IN HIS KEEPING HIS APPOINTMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN HIM TO FAIL BEFORE WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE FAILURE NOW HAD HE KEPT HIS TRYSTE THEY WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN SAFELY HOUSED AT OLD FIELD COTTAGE
6549-71114-0026 PERHAPS THURSTON SEEING THE CLOUDS HAD TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT SHE WOULD NOT COME AND HE HAD THEREFORE STAYED AWAY YET NO SHE COULD NOT FOR AN INSTANT ENTERTAIN THAT THOUGHT WELL SHE KNEW THAT HAD A STORM RISEN AND RAGED AS NEVER A STORM DID BEFORE
6549-71114-0027 THURSTON UPON THE BARE POSSIBILITY OF HER PRESENCE THERE WOULD KEEP HIS APPOINTMENT NO SOMETHING BEYOND HIS CONTROL HAD DELAYED HIM AND UNLESS HE SHOULD NOW VERY SOON APPEAR SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
6549-71114-0028 AND SHE RESOLVED TO HURRY HOME SHE HAD JUST TURNED TO GO WHEN THE SOUND OF A MAN'S HEAVY MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FELL UPON HER EAR SHE LOOKED UP HALF IN DREAD
6549-71114-0029 AND STRAINED HER EYES OUT INTO THE BLACKNESS OF THE NIGHT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING BUT THE OUTLINE OF A MAN'S FIGURE WRAPPED IN A LARGE CLOAK COMING SLOWLY ON TOWARD HER AS THE MAN DREW NEAR
6549-71114-0030 SHE RECOGNIZED THE WELL KNOWN FIGURE AIR AND GAIT SHE HAD OF THE IDENTITY SHE HASTENED TO MEET HIM EXCLAIMING IN A LOW EAGER TONE THURSTON
6549-71114-0031 THE MAN PAUSED FOLDED HIS CLOAK ABOUT HIM DREW UP AND STOOD PERFECTLY STILL WHY DID HE NOT ANSWER HER WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK TO HER WHY DID HE STAND SO MOTIONLESS AND LOOK SO STRANGE
6549-71114-0032 SHE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS COUNTENANCE EVEN IF A FLAP OF HIS CLOAK HAD NOT BEEN FOLDED ACROSS HIS FACE BUT HIS WHOLE FORM SHOOK
6549-71114-0033 THURSTON DEAR THURSTON
6549-71114-0034 AS SHE PRESSED TOWARD HIM BUT HE SUDDENLY STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO REPULSE HER GASPING AS IT WERE BREATHLESSLY NOT YET NOT YET AND AGAIN HIS WHOLE FRAME SHOOK WITH AN INWARD STORM
6549-71114-0035 WHAT COULD BE THE REASON OF HIS STRANGE BEHAVIOR OH SOME MISFORTUNE HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THAT WAS EVIDENT WOULD IT WERE ONLY OF A NATURE THAT HER OWN GOOD NEWS MIGHT BE ABLE TO CURE AND IT MIGHT BE SO
6549-71114-0036 FULL OF THIS THOUGHT SHE WAS AGAIN PRESSING TOWARD HIM WHEN A VIOLENT FLURRY OF RAIN AND WIND WHISTLED BEFORE HER AND DROVE INTO HER FACE CONCEALING HIM FROM HER VIEW WHEN THE SUDDEN GUST AS SUDDENLY PASSED
6549-71114-0037 SHE SAW THAT HE REMAINED IN THE SAME SPOT HIS BREAST HEAVING HIS WHOLE FORM SHAKING SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER SHE STARTED FORWARD AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND DROPPED HER HEAD UPON HIS BOSOM
6549-71114-0038 AND WHISPERED IN SUPPRESSED TONES DEAREST THURSTON WHAT IS THE MATTER TELL ME FOR I LOVE YOU MORE THAN LIFE THE MAN CLASPED HIS LEFT ARM FIERCELY AROUND HER WAIST LIFTED HIS RIGHT HAND
6549-71114-0039 AND HISSING SHARPLY THROUGH HIS CLENCHED TEETH YOU HAVE DRAWN ON YOUR OWN DOOM DIE
6549-71114-0040 AND PUSHED HER FROM HIM ONE SUDDEN PIERCING SHRIEK AND SHE DROPPED AT HIS FEET GRASPING AT THE GROUND AND WRITHING IN AGONY HER SOUL SEEMED STRIVING TO RECOVER THE SHOCK
6549-71114-0041 AND RECOLLECT ITS FACULTIES SHE HALF AROSE UPON HER ELBOW SUPPORTED HER HEAD UPON HER HAND AND WITH HER OTHER HAND DREW THE STEEL OUT FROM HER BOSOM
6549-71114-0042 THE BLOOD FOLLOWED AND WITH THE LIFE STREAM HER STRENGTH FLOWED AWAY THE HAND THAT SUPPORTED HER HEAD SUDDENLY DROPPED AND SHE FELL BACK THE MAN HAD BEEN STANDING OVER HER SPEECHLESS
6549-71114-0043 MOTIONLESS BREATHLESS LIKE SOME WRETCHED SOMNAMBULIST SUDDENLY AWAKENED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME AND GAZING IN HORROR AMAZEMENT AND UNBELIEF UPON THE WORK OF HIS SLEEP SUDDENLY HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES BY HER SIDE
6549-71114-0044 PUT HIS ARM UNDER HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS AND RAISED HER UP BUT HER CHIN FELL FORWARD UPON HER BOSOM AND HER EYES FIXED AND GLAZED HE LAID HER DOWN GENTLY GROANING IN A TONE OF UNSPEAKABLE ANGUISH
6549-71114-0045 MISS MAYFIELD MY GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE AND WITH AN AWFUL CRY BETWEEN A SHRIEK AND A GROAN THE WRETCHED MAN CAST HIMSELF UPON THE GROUND BY THE SIDE OF THE FALLEN BODY THE STORM WAS BEATING WILDLY
6549-71114-0046 UPON THE ASSASSIN AND HIS VICTIM BUT THE ONE FELT IT NO MORE THAN THE OTHER
