6695-252325-0000 AS WE DESIRE THROUGHOUT THIS TALE TO MAKE THE ACTORS THEMSELVES WHEREVER IT BE POSSIBLE THE NARRATORS USING THEIR WORDS IN PREFERENCE TO OUR OWN WE SHALL NOW PLACE BEFORE THE READER
6695-252325-0001 A LETTER WRITTEN BY COLONEL HARCOURT ABOUT A WEEK AFTER HIS ARRIVAL AT GLENCORE WHICH WILL AT LEAST SERVE TO RESCUE HIM AND OURSELVES FROM THE TASK OF REPETITION IT WAS ADDRESSED TO SIR HORACE UPTON
6695-252325-0002 HER MAJESTY'S ENVOY AT STUTTGARD ONE WHO HAD FORMERLY SERVED IN THE SAME REGIMENT WITH GLENCORE AND HIMSELF BUT WHO LEFT THE ARMY EARLY TO FOLLOW THE CAREER OF DIPLOMACY
6695-252325-0003 HE HAD RISEN TO THE RANK OF A MINISTER IT IS NOT IMPORTANT AT THIS MOMENT TO SPEAK MORE PARTICULARLY OF HIS CHARACTER THAN THAT IT WAS IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT THE OPPOSITE OF HIS CORRESPONDENT'S WHERE THE ONE WAS FRANK OPEN AND UNGUARDED
6695-252325-0004 THE OTHER WAS COLD CAUTIOUS AND RESERVED WHERE ONE BELIEVED THE OTHER DOUBTED WHERE ONE WAS HOPEFUL THE OTHER HAD NOTHING BUT MISGIVINGS
6695-252325-0005 HARCOURT WOULD HAVE TWENTY TIMES A DAY WOUNDED THE FEELINGS OR JARRED AGAINST THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF HIS BEST FRIEND UPTON COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO TRENCH UPON THE SLIGHTEST PREJUDICE OF HIS GREATEST ENEMY
6695-252325-0006 WE MIGHT CONTINUE THIS CONTRAST TO EVERY DETAIL OF THEIR CHARACTERS BUT ENOUGH HAS NOW BEEN SAID AND WE PROCEED TO THE LETTER IN QUESTION GLENCORE CASTLE DEAR UPTON
6695-252325-0007 TRUE TO MY PROMISE TO GIVE YOU EARLY TIDINGS OF OUR OLD FRIEND I SIT DOWN TO PEN A FEW LINES WHICH IF A RICKETY TABLE AND SOME INFERNAL LAMPBLACK FOR INK SHOULD MAKE ILLEGIBLE YOU LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE ELUCIDATION TILL MY ARRIVAL
6695-252325-0008 I FOUND GLENCORE TERRIBLY ALTERED
6695-252325-0009 HE USED TO BE MUSCULAR AND RATHER FULL IN HABIT HE IS NOW A MERE SKELETON HIS HAIR AND MUSTACHE WERE COAL BLACK THEY ARE A MOTLEY GRAY HE WAS STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW PRETENTIOUSLY ERECT MANY THOUGHT HE IS STOOPED NOW
6695-252325-0010 AND BENT NEARLY DOUBLE HIS VOICE TOO THE MOST CLEAR AND RINGING IN THE SQUADRON IS BECOME A HOARSE WHISPER YOU REMEMBER WHAT A PASSION HE HAD FOR DRESS AND HOW HEARTILY WE ALL DEPLORED THE CHANCE OF HIS BEING COLONEL
6695-252325-0011 WELL KNOWING WHAT PRECIOUS CAPRICES OF COSTLY COSTUME WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE WELL A DISCHARGED CORPORAL IN A CAST OFF MUFTI IS STYLISH COMPARED TO HIM I DON'T THINK HE HAS A HAT
6695-252325-0012 I HAVE ONLY SEEN AN OILSKIN CAP BUT HIS COAT HIS ONE COAT IS A CURIOSITY OF INDUSTRIOUS PATCHWORK AND HIS TROUSERS ARE A PAIR OF OUR OLD OVERALLS THE SAME PATTERN WE WORE AT HOUNSLOW WHEN THE KING REVIEWED US
6695-252325-0013 GREAT AS THESE CHANGES ARE THEY ARE NOTHING TO THE ALTERATION IN THE POOR FELLOW'S DISPOSITION HE THAT WAS GENEROUS TO MUNIFICENCE IS NOW AN ABSOLUTE MISER
6695-252325-0014 DESCENDING TO THE MOST PITIFUL ECONOMY AND MOANING OVER EVERY TRIFLING OUTLAY HE IS IRRITABLE TOO TO A DEGREE FAR FROM THE JOLLY LIGHT HEARTED COMRADE READY TO JOIN IN THE LAUGH AGAINST HIMSELF AND ENJOY A JEST OF WHICH HE WAS THE OBJECT
6695-252325-0015 HE SUSPECTS A SLIGHT IN EVERY ALLUSION AND BRISTLES UP TO RESENT A MERE FAMILIARITY AS THOUGH IT WERE AN INSULT OF COURSE I PUT MUCH OF THIS DOWN TO THE SCORE OF ILLNESS AND OF BAD HEALTH BEFORE HE WAS SO ILL
6695-252325-0016 BUT DEPEND UPON IT HE'S NOT THE MAN WE KNEW HIM HEAVEN KNOWS IF HE EVER WILL BE SO AGAIN THE NIGHT I ARRIVED HERE HE WAS MORE NATURAL MORE LIKE HIMSELF IN FACT THAN HE HAS EVER BEEN SINCE
6695-252325-0017 HIS MANNER WAS HEARTIER AND IN HIS WELCOME THERE WAS A TOUCH OF THE OLD JOVIAL GOOD FELLOW WHO NEVER WAS SO HAPPY AS WHEN SHARING HIS QUARTERS WITH A COMRADE SINCE THAT HE HAS GROWN PUNCTILIOUS ANXIOUSLY ASKING ME IF I AM COMFORTABLE
6695-252325-0018 AND TEASING ME WITH APOLOGIES FOR WHAT I DON'T MISS AND EXCUSES ABOUT THINGS THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DISCOVERED WANTING I THINK I SEE WHAT IS PASSING WITHIN HIM HE WANTS TO BE CONFIDENTIAL AND HE DOES N'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT
6695-252325-0019 I SUPPOSE HE LOOKS ON ME AS RATHER A ROUGH FATHER TO CONFESS TO HE IS N'T QUITE SURE WHAT KIND OF SYMPATHY IF ANY HE LL MEET WITH FROM ME AND HE MORE THAN HALF DREADS A CERTAIN CARELESS OUTSPOKEN WAY IN WHICH I HAVE NOW AND THEN ADDRESSED HIS BOY
6695-252325-0020 OF WHOM MORE ANON I MAY BE RIGHT OR I MAY BE WRONG IN THIS CONJECTURE BUT CERTAIN IT IS THAT NOTHING LIKE CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION HAS YET PASSED BETWEEN US AND EACH DAY SEEMS TO RENDER THE PROSPECT OF SUCH ONLY LESS AND LESS LIKELY
6695-252325-0021 I WISH FROM MY HEART YOU WERE HERE YOU ARE JUST THE FELLOW TO SUIT HIM JUST CALCULATED TO NOURISH THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES THAT I ONLY SHOCK I SAID AS MUCH T OTHER DAY IN A HALF CARELESS WAY AND HE IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT IT UP AND SAID
6695-252325-0022 AY GEORGE UPTON IS A MAN ONE WANTS NOW AND THEN IN LIFE AND WHEN THE MOMENT COMES THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR HIM IN A JOKING MANNER I THEN REMARKED WHY NOT COME OVER TO SEE HIM
6695-252325-0023 MORE BRUTAL PITY IN A TORRENT OF PASSION HE WENT ON IN THIS STRAIN TILL I HEARTILY REGRETTED THAT I HAD EVER TOUCHED THIS UNLUCKY TOPIC I DATE HIS GREATEST RESERVE FROM THAT SAME MOMENT
6695-252325-0024 AND I AM SURE HE IS DISPOSED TO CONNECT ME WITH THE CASUAL SUGGESTION TO GO OVER TO STUTTGARD AND DEEMS ME IN CONSEQUENCE ONE UTTERLY DEFICIENT IN ALL TRUE FEELING AND DELICACY
6695-252325-0025 IS THE REVERSE OF A PLEASURE I M NEVER WHAT FINE PEOPLE CALL BORED ANYWHERE AND I COULD AMUSE MYSELF GLORIOUSLY IN THIS QUEER SPOT I HAVE SHOT SOME HALF DOZEN SEALS
6695-252325-0026 AND HAVE HAD RARE COURSING NOT TO SAY THAT GLENCORE'S TABLE WITH CERTAIN REFORMS I HAVE INTRODUCED IS VERY TOLERABLE AND HIS CELLAR UNIMPEACHABLE
6695-252325-0027 I'LL BACK HIS CHAMBERTIN AGAINST YOUR EXCELLENCY'S AND I HAVE DISCOVERED A BIN OF RED HERMITAGE THAT WOULD CONVERT A WHOLE VINEYARD OF THE SMALLEST LAFITTE
6695-252325-0028 BUT WITH ALL THESE SEDUCTIONS I CAN'T STAND THE LIFE OF CONTINUED RESTRAINT I M REDUCED TO GLENCORE EVIDENTLY SENT FOR ME TO MAKE SOME REVELATIONS WHICH NOW THAT HE SEES ME HE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH
6695-252325-0029 FOR AUGHT I KNOW THERE MAY BE AS MANY CHANGES IN ME TO HIS EYES AS TO MINE THERE ARE IN HIM I ONLY CAN VOUCH FOR IT THAT IF I RIDE THREE STONE HEAVIER
6695-252325-0030 AND I DON'T DETECT ANY STRIKING FALLING OFF IN MY APPRECIATION OF GOOD FARE AND GOOD FELLOWS I SPOKE OF THE BOY HE IS A FINE LAD SOMEWHAT HAUGHTY PERHAPS A LITTLE SPOILED BY THE COUNTRY PEOPLE CALLING HIM THE YOUNG LORD
6695-252325-0031 BUT A GENEROUS FELLOW AND VERY LIKE GLENCORE WHEN HE FIRST JOINED US AT CANTERBURY BY WAY OF EDUCATING HIM HIMSELF GLENCORE HAS BEEN DRIVING VIRGIL AND DECIMAL FRACTIONS INTO HIM AND THE BOY BRED IN THE COUNTRY
6695-252325-0032 NEVER OUT OF IT FOR A DAY CAN'T LOAD A GUN OR TIE A HACKLE NOT THE WORST THING ABOUT THE LAD IS HIS INORDINATE LOVE FOR GLENCORE WHOM HE IMAGINES TO BE ABOUT THE GREATEST AND MOST GIFTED BEING THAT EVER LIVED
6695-252325-0033 I CAN SCARCELY HELP SMILING AT THE IMPLICITNESS OF THIS HONEST FAITH BUT I TAKE GOOD CARE NOT TO SMILE ON THE CONTRARY I GIVE EVERY POSSIBLE ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE BELIEF I CONCLUDE THE DISENCHANTMENT WILL ARRIVE ONLY TOO EARLY AT LAST
6695-252325-0034 YOU LL NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF SUCH A LENGTHY EPISTLE FROM ME AND YOU LL DOUBTLESS TORTURE THAT FINE DIPLOMATIC INTELLIGENCE OF YOURS TO DETECT THE SECRET MOTIVE OF MY LONG WINDEDNESS BUT THE SIMPLE FACT IS IT HAS RAINED INCESSANTLY FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS
6695-252325-0035 AND PROMISES THE SAME CHEERING WEATHER FOR AS MANY MORE GLENCORE DOESN'T FANCY THAT THE BOY'S LESSONS SHOULD BE BROKEN IN UPON AND HINC ISTAE LITTERAE THAT'S CLASSICAL FOR YOU I WISH I COULD SAY WHEN I AM LIKELY TO BEAT MY RETREAT
6695-252325-0036 IF I THOUGHT MYSELF OF ANY USE BUT I CANNOT PERSUADE MYSELF THAT I AM SUCH GLENCORE IS NOW ABOUT AGAIN FEEBLE OF COURSE AND MUCH PULLED DOWN BUT ABLE TO GO ABOUT THE HOUSE AND THE GARDEN
6695-252325-0037 I CAN CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TO HIS RECOVERY AND I FEAR AS LITTLE TO HIS COMFORT I EVEN DOUBT IF HE DESIRES ME TO PROLONG MY VISIT BUT SUCH IS MY FEAR OF OFFENDING HIM THAT I ACTUALLY DREAD TO ALLUDE TO MY DEPARTURE TILL I CAN SOUND MY WAY AS TO HOW HE LL TAKE IT
6695-252325-0038 THIS FACT ALONE WILL SHOW YOU HOW MUCH HE IS CHANGED FROM THE GLENCORE OF LONG AGO ANOTHER FEATURE IN HIM TOTALLY UNLIKE HIS FORMER SELF STRUCK ME THE OTHER EVENING WE WERE TALKING OF OLD MESSMATES CROYDON STANHOPE LOFTUS AND YOURSELF
6695-252325-0039 AND INSTEAD OF DWELLING AS HE ONCE WOULD HAVE DONE EXCLUSIVELY ON YOUR TRAITS OF CHARACTER AND DISPOSITION HE DISCUSSED NOTHING BUT YOUR ABILITIES AND THE CAPACITY BY WHICH YOU COULD WIN YOUR WAY TO HONORS AND DISTINCTION
6695-252325-0040 YOU CAME OFF BEST INDEED HE PROFESSES THE HIGHEST ESTEEM FOR YOUR TALENTS AND SAYS YOU'LL SEE UPTON EITHER A CABINET MINISTER OR AMBASSADOR AT PARIS YET AND THIS HE REPEATED IN THE SAME WORDS LAST NIGHT
6695-252325-0041 AS IF TO SHOW IT WAS NOT DROPPED AS A MERE RANDOM OBSERVATION I HAVE SOME SCRUPLES ABOUT VENTURING TO OFFER ANYTHING BORDERING ON A SUGGESTION TO A GREAT AND WILY DIPLOMATIST LIKE YOURSELF
6695-252325-0042 BUT IF AN ILLUSTRIOUS FRAMER OF TREATIES AND PROTOCOLS WOULD CONDESCEND TO TAKE A HINT FROM AN OLD DRAGOON COLONEL
6695-252325-0043 AND LEAD HIM TO UNBURTHEN TO YOU WHAT HE EVIDENTLY CANNOT PERSUADE HIMSELF TO REVEAL TO ME I CAN SEE PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ON HIS MIND BUT I KNOW IT JUST AS A STUPID OLD HOUND FEELS THERE IS A FOX IN THE COVER
6695-252325-0044 BUT CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF HIM SEE HOW HE'S TO DRAW HIM A LETTER FROM YOU WOULD DO HIM GOOD AT ALL EVENTS EVEN THE LITTLE GOSSIP OF YOUR GOSSIPING CAREER WOULD CHEER AND AMUSE HIM HE SAID VERY PLAINTIVELY TWO NIGHTS AGO
6695-252325-0045 WHEN A MAN RETIRES FROM THE WORLD HE BEGINS TO DIE
6695-252325-0046 TO A LONG AGONY OF TORTURE DO WRITE TO HIM THEN THE ADDRESS IS GLENCORE CASTLE LEENANE IRELAND WHERE I SUPPOSE I SHALL BE STILL A RESIDENT FOR ANOTHER FORTNIGHT TO COME
6695-252325-0047 GLENCORE HAS JUST SENT FOR ME BUT I MUST CLOSE THIS FOR THE POST OR IT WILL BE TOO LATE YOURS EVER TRULY GEORGE HARCOURT I OPEN THIS TO SAY THAT HE SENT FOR ME TO ASK YOUR ADDRESS WHETHER THROUGH THE FOREIGN OFFICE OR DIRECT TO STUTTGARD
6695-252325-0048 POOR FELLOW HE LOOKS VERY ILL TO DAY HE SAYS THAT HE NEVER SLEPT THE WHOLE NIGHT AND THAT THE LAUDANUM HE TOOK TO INDUCE DROWSINESS ONLY EXCITED AND MADDENED HIM I COUNSELLED A HOT JORUM OF MULLED PORTER BEFORE GETTING INTO BED
6695-252325-0049 BUT HE DEEMED ME A MONSTER FOR THE RECOMMENDATION AND SEEMED QUITE DISGUSTED BESIDES COULD N'T YOU SEND HIM OVER A DESPATCH
