6784-76152-0000 THE VICTORY MY FIRST INTENT WAS TO LET THEM ADVANCE UNHAMPERED
6784-76152-0001 AND SO WE DISPUTED THEIR COURSE ALL THE WAY I GAVE ORDERS TO SHOW NO GREAT AMOUNT OF RESISTANCE AND THUS THE LOUTS REACHED VLAMA IN HIGH FEATHER CONFIDENT THAT THE GAME WAS THEIRS
6784-76152-0002 I STOOD AT THE DOOR OF THE PALACE AS KLOW HIMSELF ROLLED UP TO THE EDGE OF THE PARADE GROUND MY MEN OBEYING ORDERS HAD GIVEN WAY TO HIM HIS CREWS SWARMED THE SPACE BEHIND AND ON ALL SIDES OF HIM
6784-76152-0003 WHILE MY OWN BULLIES WERE ALL ABOUT AND BEHIND THE PALACE NEVER DID TWO SUCH GIANT ARMIES FACE ONE ANOTHER IN PEACE FOR I HAD CAUSED MY BANNER TO BE FLOATED WRONG END TO IN TOKEN OF SURRENDER
6784-76152-0004 FIRST A SMALL BODY OF SUBORDINATES WAITED UPON ME DEMANDING THAT I GIVE UP THE THRONE
6784-76152-0005 AND SHORTLY THE KNAVE SURROUNDED BY PERHAPS FIFTY UNDERLINGS STEPPED UP BEFORE ME HAIL STROKER HE GROWLED HIS VOICE SHAKING A BIT WITH EXCITEMENT NOT WITH FEAR FOR HE WERE A BRAVE MAN
6784-76152-0006 HAIL TO THEE AND TO THINE AND A PLEASANT STAY IN HOFE FOR YE ALL HAIL KLOW REPLIED I GLANCING UP MEANINGLY AT THE AIR MONSTERS WHEELING THERE
6784-76152-0007 I TAKE IT THAT YE PURPOSE TO EXECUTE US
6784-76152-0008 THOU DIDST ATTACK WITHOUT PROVOCATION THY LIFE IS FORFEIT AND AS MANY MORE AS MAY BE FOUND NEEDFUL TO GUARANTEE PEACE THEN I QUOTH MY MANNER CHANGING
6784-76152-0009 THEN YE HAVE SAVED ME THE TROUBLE OF DECIDING WHAT SHALL BE THY FATE EXECUTION SAY YOU SO BE IT AND I STRODE DOWN TO THE GREAT LOG OF IRON WHICH LAY READY TO FILL THE GAP
6784-76152-0010 KLOW LOOKED AT ME WITH A PECULIAR EXPRESSION AS THOUGH HE THOUGHT ME MAD TRUE IT LOOKED IT HOW COULD I DO HIM HARM WITHOUT MYSELF SUFFERING BUT I KICKED THE PROPS WHICH HELD THE IRON
6784-76152-0011 AND GAVE IT A START WITH MY FOOT THE ENDS OF THE POLE TO POLE ROD LAY CONCEALED BY BRUSH PERCHANCE FIFTY YARDS AWAY IN TEN SECONDS THAT LAST SECTION HAD ROLLED COMPLETELY BETWEEN THEM
6784-76152-0012 AND ONLY A FOOL WOULD HAVE MISSED SEEING THAT THE LAST TEN FEET THE IRON WAS FAIR JERKED THROUGH THE AIR AS THIS HAPPENED WE ALL HEARD A TREMENDOUS CRACKLING LIKE THAT OF NEARBY LIGHTNING
6784-76152-0013 WHILE ENORMOUS CLOUDS OF DUST AROSE FROM THE TWO CONCEALED ENDS WHICH WERE NOW BECOME CONNECTIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME A LOUD STEELY CLICK JUST ONE AND NO MORE SOUNDED FROM THE INTRUDING HOST
6784-76152-0014 THEN HE SNARLED ANGRILY WHAT MEANS THIS FOOLERY STROKOR ADVANCE AND GIVE UP THY AX FOR ANSWER I TURNED ME ABOUT SO AS TO FACE MY MEN AND HELD UP MY HAND IN SIGNAL
6784-76152-0015 INSTANTLY THE WHISTLES SOUNDED AND MY HEARTIES CAME BOUNDING INTO THE FIELD TREACHERY SHOUTED KLOW AND HIS OFFICERS RAN HERE AND THERE SHOUTING TO ARMS CHARGE AND DESTROY
6784-76152-0016 BUT I PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE HUBBUB I WERE GAZING UP AT THOSE INFERNAL CREATURES OF THE AIR AND MY HEART SANG WITHIN ME AS I SAW THEM CIRCLING ERRATICALLY BUT VERY SURELY DOWN TO THE EARTH
6784-76152-0017 AND AS THEY CAME NEARER MY SATISFACTION WAS ENTIRE FOR THEIR ENGINES WERE SILENT AT THE SAME TIME CONSTERNATION WAS REIGNING AMONG OUR VISITORS
6784-76152-0018 EVERY SLINGER WAS JAMMED AS THOUGH FROZEN BY INVISIBLE ICE ALL THEIR BALLS AND SHELLS WERE STUCK TOGETHER LIKE THE WORK OF A TRANSPARENT GLUE EVEN THEIR SIDE ARMS WERE LOCKED IN THEIR SCABBARDS
6784-76152-0019 AND ALL THEIR TUGGING COULD BUDGE THEM NOT BUT NONE OF MY MEN WERE SO HANDICAPPED EACH MAN'S CHARIOT WAS RUNNING AS THOUGH NAUGHT HAD HAPPENED
6784-76152-0020 THEY THUNDERED FORWARD DISCHARGING THEIR BALLS AND SHELLS AS FREELY AS THEY HAD ACROSS THE SEA THEIR CHARGE WAS A MURDEROUS ONE NOT A MAN OF KLOW'S WAS ABLE TO RESIST SAVE WITH WHAT FORCE HE COULD PUT INTO HIS BARE HANDS
6784-76152-0021 NONE WERE ABLE TO MORE THAN PLACE HIS BODY TWIXT US AND THEIR CHIEF IN A VERY FEW MOMENTS THEY SAW THAT THE UNKNOWN MAGIC HAD MADE THEM AS CHILDREN IN OUR HANDS THEY WERE UTTERLY LOST
6784-76152-0022 WHAT MEANS THIS YE HUGE BUNDLE OF LIES WHAT MEAN YE BY TRICKING US WITH YON BADGE OF SURRENDER ONLY TO TIE OUR HANDS WITH THY MAGIC OF HOFE IS THIS THE WAY TO FIGHT LIKE A MAN
6784-76152-0023 I HAD STOOD AT EASE IN MY DOOR SINCE ROLLING THE IRON NOW I LOOKED ABOUT ME STILL MORE EASILY MY MEN WERE RUNNING DOWN THE LOUTS WHO HAD JUMPED FROM THEIR USELESS CHARIOTS AND TAKEN TO THEIR HEELS
6784-76152-0024 YE ARE RIGHT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO FIGHT LIKE A MAN NEITHER I POINTED OUT ONE OF THE FALLEN AIR CARS NEITHER IS THAT THE WAY
6784-76152-0025 FLITTING OVER OUR HEADS LIKE SHADOWS AND DESTROYING US WITH FILTHY SMOKE
6784-76152-0026 YOU ATTACKED US WITHOUT PROVOCATION HE MUTTERED SOURLY AYE AND FOR A VERY GOOD REASON I REPLIED YET I SEE THY VIEWPOINT
6784-76152-0027 AND SHALT GIVE THEE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT I TURNED TO MY WHISTLERS AND GAVE AN ORDER SO THAT PRESENTLY THE GREAT SLAUGHTER HAD STOPPED MY MEN AND KLOW'S ALIKE STRUGGLED BACK TO SEE WHAT WERE AMISS
6784-76152-0028 I HANDED KLOW AN AX THROW AWAY THINE OWN SCABBARD AND ALL I TOLD HIM IT IS USELESS FOR TIS MADE OF IRON
6784-76152-0029 OURS AND ALL OUR TOOLS OF WAR ARE FORMED OF AN ALLOY WHICH IS IMMUNE FROM THE MAGIC HE TOOK THE AX IN WONDERMENT WHAT MEANS IT STROKOR
6784-76152-0030 ASKED HE AGAIN MEANWHILE STRIPPING HIMSELF IN A BUSINESSLIKE FASHION THAT IT WERE GOOD TO SEE IT MEANS SAID I THROWING OFF MY ROBE THAT I HAVE UNCHAINED THE MAGNETISM OF THIS WORLD
6784-76152-0031 IT IS LIKE UNTO THAT OF THE TINY MAGNET WHICH YE GIVE CHILDREN FOR TO PLAY BUT IT IS MIGHTY EVEN AS OUR WORLD IS MIGHTY GOOD JON HE GASPED FOR HIS WAS NOT A DARING MIND
6784-76152-0032 WHAT HAVE YE DONE YE TRIFLER I HAVE TRANSFORMED THIS EMPIRE INTO ONE VAST MAGNET I ANSWERED COOLLY THEN I SHOWED HIM A BOULDER ON THE SUMMIT OF A DISTANT HILL
6784-76152-0033 THROUGH THE TUBE KLOW COULD SEE SOME OF MY MEN STANDING BESIDE IT PLACE ONE OF THY OWN MEN ON THE ROOF OF THE PALACE I TOLD KLOW AND GIVE HIM ORDERS TO LOWER MY BANNER SHOULD YE GIVE HIM THE WORD
6784-76152-0034 HINGES THE WHOLE AFFAIR IF THOU DOST SURVIVE DOWN COMES MY BANNER AND MY MEN ON THE HILL SHALL TOPPLE THE BOULDER WHICH SHALL RUSH DOWN THE SLOPE AND BURST THE IRON ROD AND BREAK THE SPELL
6784-76152-0035 STAND THEN AND DEFEND THYSELF AND IT DID ME GOOD TO SEE THE SPIRIT FLY INTO HIS EYES HE SAW THAT HIS EMPIRE LIVED OR DIED AS HE LIVED OR DIED
6784-76152-0036 AND HE FOUGHT AS HE HAD NEVER FOUGHT BEFORE SMALL MAN THAT HE WAS BESIDE MYSELF HE WERE WONDROUS QUICK AND SURE IN HIS MOTIONS BEFORE I KNEW IT HE HAD BIT HIS AX DEEP INTO MY SIDE
6784-76152-0037 AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT OR TWO IT WAS OVER
