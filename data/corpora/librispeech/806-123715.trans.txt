806-123715-0000 HA HA HA BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CHOICE IN REALITY SAY WHAT YOU LIKE YOU WILL INTERPOSE WITH A CHUCKLE SCIENCE HAS SUCCEEDED IN SO FAR ANALYSING MAN THAT WE KNOW ALREADY THAT CHOICE AND WHAT IS CALLED FREEDOM OF WILL IS NOTHING ELSE THAN
806-123715-0001 STAY GENTLEMEN I MEANT TO BEGIN WITH THAT MYSELF I CONFESS I WAS RATHER FRIGHTENED I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT THE DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHAT CHOICE DEPENDS ON AND THAT PERHAPS THAT WAS A VERY GOOD THING BUT I REMEMBERED THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE
806-123715-0002 AND PULLED MYSELF UP AND HERE YOU HAVE BEGUN UPON IT INDEED IF THERE REALLY IS SOME DAY DISCOVERED A FORMULA FOR ALL OUR DESIRES AND CAPRICES THAT IS AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT THEY DEPEND UPON BY WHAT LAWS THEY ARISE
806-123715-0003 HOW THEY DEVELOP WHAT THEY ARE AIMING AT IN ONE CASE AND IN ANOTHER AND SO ON THAT IS A REAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULA THEN MOST LIKELY MAN WILL AT ONCE CEASE TO FEEL DESIRE INDEED HE WILL BE CERTAIN TO FOR WHO WOULD WANT TO CHOOSE BY RULE
806-123715-0004 BESIDES HE WILL AT ONCE BE TRANSFORMED FROM A HUMAN BEING INTO AN ORGAN STOP OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT FOR WHAT IS A MAN WITHOUT DESIRES WITHOUT FREE WILL AND WITHOUT CHOICE IF NOT A STOP IN AN ORGAN WHAT DO YOU THINK
806-123715-0005 OUR CHOICE IS USUALLY MISTAKEN FROM A FALSE VIEW OF OUR ADVANTAGE WE SOMETIMES CHOOSE ABSOLUTE NONSENSE BECAUSE IN OUR FOOLISHNESS WE SEE IN THAT NONSENSE THE EASIEST MEANS FOR ATTAINING A SUPPOSED ADVANTAGE
806-123715-0006 BUT WHEN ALL THAT IS EXPLAINED AND WORKED OUT ON PAPER WHICH IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE FOR IT IS CONTEMPTIBLE AND SENSELESS TO SUPPOSE THAT SOME LAWS OF NATURE MAN WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THEN CERTAINLY SO CALLED DESIRES WILL NO LONGER EXIST
806-123715-0007 FOR IF A DESIRE SHOULD COME INTO CONFLICT WITH REASON WE SHALL THEN REASON AND NOT DESIRE BECAUSE IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE RETAINING OUR REASON TO BE SENSELESS IN OUR DESIRES AND IN THAT WAY KNOWINGLY ACT AGAINST REASON AND DESIRE TO INJURE OURSELVES
806-123715-0008 AND AS ALL CHOICE AND REASONING CAN BE REALLY CALCULATED BECAUSE THERE WILL SOME DAY BE DISCOVERED THE LAWS OF OUR SO CALLED FREE WILL SO JOKING APART THERE MAY ONE DAY BE SOMETHING LIKE A TABLE CONSTRUCTED OF THEM SO THAT WE REALLY SHALL CHOOSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT
806-123715-0009 IF FOR INSTANCE SOME DAY THEY CALCULATE AND PROVE TO ME THAT I MADE A LONG NOSE AT SOMEONE BECAUSE I COULD NOT HELP MAKING A LONG NOSE AT HIM AND THAT I HAD TO DO IT IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY WHAT FREEDOM IS LEFT ME
806-123715-0010 ESPECIALLY IF I AM A LEARNED MAN AND HAVE TAKEN MY DEGREE SOMEWHERE THEN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CALCULATE MY WHOLE LIFE FOR THIRTY YEARS BEFOREHAND IN SHORT IF THIS COULD BE ARRANGED THERE WOULD BE NOTHING LEFT FOR US TO DO ANYWAY WE SHOULD HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT
806-123715-0011 AND IN FACT WE OUGHT UNWEARYINGLY TO REPEAT TO OURSELVES THAT AT SUCH AND SUCH A TIME AND IN SUCH AND SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES NATURE DOES NOT ASK OUR LEAVE THAT WE HAVE GOT TO TAKE HER AS SHE IS AND NOT FASHION HER TO SUIT OUR FANCY
806-123715-0012 AND IF WE REALLY ASPIRE TO FORMULAS AND TABLES OF RULES AND WELL EVEN TO THE CHEMICAL RETORT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT WE MUST ACCEPT THE RETORT TOO OR ELSE IT WILL BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT OUR CONSENT
806-123715-0013 YES BUT HERE I COME TO A STOP GENTLEMEN YOU MUST EXCUSE ME FOR BEING OVER PHILOSOPHICAL IT'S THE RESULT OF FORTY YEARS UNDERGROUND ALLOW ME TO INDULGE MY FANCY
806-123715-0014 YOU SEE GENTLEMEN REASON IS AN EXCELLENT THING THERE'S NO DISPUTING THAT BUT REASON IS NOTHING BUT REASON AND SATISFIES ONLY THE RATIONAL SIDE OF MAN'S NATURE WHILE WILL IS A MANIFESTATION OF THE WHOLE LIFE
806-123715-0015 THAT IS OF THE WHOLE HUMAN LIFE INCLUDING REASON AND ALL THE IMPULSES AND ALTHOUGH OUR LIFE IN THIS MANIFESTATION OF IT IS OFTEN WORTHLESS YET IT IS LIFE AND NOT SIMPLY EXTRACTING SQUARE ROOTS
806-123715-0016 HERE I FOR INSTANCE QUITE NATURALLY WANT TO LIVE IN ORDER TO SATISFY ALL MY CAPACITIES FOR LIFE AND NOT SIMPLY MY CAPACITY FOR REASONING THAT IS NOT SIMPLY ONE TWENTIETH OF MY CAPACITY FOR LIFE
806-123715-0017 WHAT DOES REASON KNOW REASON ONLY KNOWS WHAT IT HAS SUCCEEDED IN LEARNING SOME THINGS PERHAPS IT WILL NEVER LEARN THIS IS A POOR COMFORT BUT WHY NOT SAY SO FRANKLY AND HUMAN NATURE ACTS AS A WHOLE WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS IN IT
806-123715-0018 CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY AND EVEN IF IT GOES WRONG IT LIVES I SUSPECT GENTLEMEN THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT ME WITH COMPASSION YOU TELL ME AGAIN THAT AN ENLIGHTENED AND DEVELOPED MAN SUCH IN SHORT AS THE FUTURE MAN WILL BE
806-123715-0019 CANNOT CONSCIOUSLY DESIRE ANYTHING DISADVANTAGEOUS TO HIMSELF THAT THAT CAN BE PROVED MATHEMATICALLY I THOROUGHLY AGREE IT CAN BY MATHEMATICS BUT I REPEAT FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME THERE IS ONE CASE ONE ONLY
806-123715-0020 WHEN MAN MAY CONSCIOUSLY PURPOSELY DESIRE WHAT IS INJURIOUS TO HIMSELF WHAT IS STUPID VERY STUPID SIMPLY IN ORDER TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DESIRE FOR HIMSELF EVEN WHAT IS VERY STUPID
806-123715-0021 OF COURSE THIS VERY STUPID THING THIS CAPRICE OF OURS MAY BE IN REALITY GENTLEMEN MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR US THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON EARTH ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN CASES AND IN PARTICULAR IT MAY BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS THAN ANY ADVANTAGE
806-123715-0022 EVEN WHEN IT DOES US OBVIOUS HARM AND CONTRADICTS THE SOUNDEST CONCLUSIONS OF OUR REASON CONCERNING OUR ADVANTAGE FOR IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT PRESERVES FOR US WHAT IS MOST PRECIOUS AND MOST IMPORTANT THAT IS OUR PERSONALITY OUR INDIVIDUALITY
806-123715-0023 SOME YOU SEE MAINTAIN THAT THIS REALLY IS THE MOST PRECIOUS THING FOR MANKIND CHOICE CAN OF COURSE IF IT CHOOSES BE IN AGREEMENT WITH REASON AND ESPECIALLY IF THIS BE NOT ABUSED BUT KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS
806-123715-0024 IT IS PROFITABLE AND SOMETIMES EVEN PRAISEWORTHY BUT VERY OFTEN AND EVEN MOST OFTEN CHOICE IS UTTERLY AND STUBBORNLY OPPOSED TO REASON AND AND DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT TOO IS PROFITABLE
806-123715-0025 SOMETIMES EVEN PRAISEWORTHY GENTLEMEN LET US SUPPOSE THAT MAN IS NOT STUPID INDEED ONE CANNOT REFUSE TO SUPPOSE THAT IF ONLY FROM THE ONE CONSIDERATION THAT IF MAN IS STUPID THEN WHO IS WISE BUT IF HE IS NOT STUPID
806-123715-0026 PHENOMENALLY UNGRATEFUL
806-123715-0027 BUT THAT IS NOT ALL THAT IS NOT HIS WORST DEFECT HIS WORST DEFECT IS HIS PERPETUAL MORAL OBLIQUITY PERPETUAL FROM THE DAYS OF THE FLOOD TO THE SCHLESWIG HOLSTEIN PERIOD
806-123715-0028 MORAL OBLIQUITY AND CONSEQUENTLY LACK OF GOOD SENSE FOR IT HAS LONG BEEN ACCEPTED THAT LACK OF GOOD SENSE IS DUE TO NO OTHER CAUSE THAN MORAL OBLIQUITY PUT IT TO THE TEST AND CAST YOUR EYES UPON THE HISTORY OF MANKIND
806-123715-0029 WHAT WILL YOU SEE IS IT A GRAND SPECTACLE GRAND IF YOU LIKE TAKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES FOR INSTANCE THAT'S WORTH SOMETHING
806-123715-0030 THAT SOME SAY THAT IT IS THE WORK OF MAN'S HANDS WHILE OTHERS MAINTAIN THAT IT HAS BEEN CREATED BY NATURE HERSELF IS IT MANY COLOURED MAY BE IT IS MANY COLOURED TOO IF ONE TAKES THE DRESS UNIFORMS MILITARY AND CIVILIAN
806-123715-0031 OF ALL PEOPLES IN ALL AGES THAT ALONE IS WORTH SOMETHING AND IF YOU TAKE THE UNDRESS UNIFORMS YOU WILL NEVER GET TO THE END OF IT NO HISTORIAN WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE JOB IS IT MONOTONOUS
806-123715-0032 MAY BE IT'S MONOTONOUS TOO IT'S FIGHTING AND FIGHTING THEY ARE FIGHTING NOW THEY FOUGHT FIRST AND THEY FOUGHT LAST YOU WILL ADMIT THAT IT IS ALMOST TOO MONOTONOUS IN SHORT ONE MAY SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
806-123715-0033 ANYTHING THAT MIGHT ENTER THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION THE ONLY THING ONE CAN'T SAY IS THAT IT'S RATIONAL THE VERY WORD STICKS IN ONE'S THROAT AND INDEED THIS IS THE ODD THING THAT IS CONTINUALLY HAPPENING
806-123715-0034 THERE ARE CONTINUALLY TURNING UP IN LIFE MORAL AND RATIONAL PERSONS SAGES AND LOVERS OF HUMANITY WHO MAKE IT THEIR OBJECT TO LIVE ALL THEIR LIVES AS MORALLY AND RATIONALLY AS POSSIBLE TO BE SO TO SPEAK
806-123715-0035 A LIGHT TO THEIR NEIGHBOURS SIMPLY IN ORDER TO SHOW THEM THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO LIVE MORALLY AND RATIONALLY IN THIS WORLD AND YET WE ALL KNOW THAT THOSE VERY PEOPLE SOONER OR LATER HAVE BEEN FALSE TO THEMSELVES PLAYING SOME QUEER TRICK
806-123715-0036 OFTEN A MOST UNSEEMLY ONE NOW I ASK YOU WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF MAN SINCE HE IS A BEING ENDOWED WITH STRANGE QUALITIES SHOWER UPON HIM EVERY EARTHLY BLESSING
806-123715-0037 DROWN HIM IN A SEA OF HAPPINESS SO THAT NOTHING BUT BUBBLES OF BLISS CAN BE SEEN ON THE SURFACE GIVE HIM ECONOMIC PROSPERITY SUCH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT SLEEP EAT CAKES AND BUSY HIMSELF WITH THE CONTINUATION OF HIS SPECIES
806-123715-0038 AND EVEN THEN OUT OF SHEER INGRATITUDE SHEER SPITE MAN WOULD PLAY YOU SOME NASTY TRICK HE WOULD EVEN RISK HIS CAKES AND WOULD DELIBERATELY DESIRE THE MOST FATAL RUBBISH
806-123715-0039 THE MOST UNECONOMICAL ABSURDITY SIMPLY TO INTRODUCE INTO ALL THIS POSITIVE GOOD SENSE HIS FATAL FANTASTIC ELEMENT IT IS JUST HIS FANTASTIC DREAMS HIS VULGAR FOLLY THAT HE WILL DESIRE TO RETAIN
806-123715-0040 SIMPLY IN ORDER TO PROVE TO HIMSELF AS THOUGH THAT WERE SO NECESSARY THAT MEN STILL ARE MEN AND NOT THE KEYS OF A PIANO WHICH THE LAWS OF NATURE THREATEN TO CONTROL SO COMPLETELY THAT SOON ONE WILL BE ABLE TO DESIRE NOTHING BUT BY THE CALENDAR
806-123715-0041 AND THAT IS NOT ALL EVEN IF MAN REALLY WERE NOTHING BUT A PIANO KEY EVEN IF THIS WERE PROVED TO HIM BY NATURAL SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EVEN THEN HE WOULD NOT BECOME REASONABLE
806-123715-0042 BUT WOULD PURPOSELY DO SOMETHING PERVERSE OUT OF SIMPLE INGRATITUDE SIMPLY TO GAIN HIS POINT AND IF HE DOES NOT FIND MEANS HE WILL CONTRIVE DESTRUCTION AND CHAOS WILL CONTRIVE SUFFERINGS OF ALL SORTS
806-123715-0043 ONLY TO GAIN HIS POINT HE WILL LAUNCH A CURSE UPON THE WORLD AND AS ONLY MAN CAN CURSE IT IS HIS PRIVILEGE THE PRIMARY DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIM AND OTHER ANIMALS MAY BE BY HIS CURSE ALONE HE WILL ATTAIN HIS OBJECT
806-123715-0044 THAT IS CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT HE IS A MAN AND NOT A PIANO KEY IF YOU SAY THAT ALL THIS TOO CAN BE CALCULATED AND TABULATED CHAOS AND DARKNESS AND CURSES SO THAT THE MERE POSSIBILITY OF CALCULATING IT ALL BEFOREHAND
806-123715-0045 WOULD STOP IT ALL AND REASON WOULD REASSERT ITSELF THEN MAN WOULD PURPOSELY GO MAD IN ORDER TO BE RID OF REASON AND GAIN HIS POINT I BELIEVE IN IT I ANSWER FOR IT
806-123715-0046 FOR THE WHOLE WORK OF MAN REALLY SEEMS TO CONSIST IN NOTHING BUT PROVING TO HIMSELF EVERY MINUTE THAT HE IS A MAN AND NOT A PIANO KEY IT MAY BE AT THE COST OF HIS SKIN IT MAY BE BY CANNIBALISM AND THIS BEING SO
806-123715-0047 CAN ONE HELP BEING TEMPTED TO REJOICE THAT IT HAS NOT YET COME OFF AND THAT DESIRE STILL DEPENDS ON SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW YOU WILL SCREAM AT ME THAT IS IF YOU CONDESCEND TO DO SO THAT NO ONE IS TOUCHING MY FREE WILL
806-123715-0048 WITH THE LAWS OF NATURE AND ARITHMETIC GOOD HEAVENS GENTLEMEN WHAT SORT OF FREE WILL IS LEFT WHEN WE COME TO TABULATION AND ARITHMETIC WHEN IT WILL ALL BE A CASE OF TWICE TWO MAKE FOUR
