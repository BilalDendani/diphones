5044-30592-0028 AND WHIPPED EGGS STONED RAISINS STIRRED CONCOCTED AND BAKED UNTIL DARK WHEN BEDTIME CAME SHE WAS SO TIRED THAT SHE COULD HARDLY CRAWL UPSTAIRS BUT SHE FELT HAPPY TOO FOR THE DAY HAD BEEN A SUCCESSFUL ONE AND SO ALSO WERE THE DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED
5044-30592-0029 IT WAS HARD AND CONSTANT WORK BUT IT BROUGHT ITS REWARD LILIAN HAD NOT PROMISED MORE THAN SHE COULD PERFORM AND HER CUSTOMERS WERE SATISFIED IN A SHORT TIME SHE FOUND HERSELF WITH A REGULAR AND GROWING BUSINESS ON HER HANDS FOR NEW CUSTOMERS WERE GRADUALLY ADDED AND ALWAYS CAME TO STAY
5044-30592-0030 SHE HAD A VERY BUSY WINTER AND OF COURSE IT WAS NOT ALL PLAIN SAILING SHE HAD MANY DIFFICULTIES TO CONTEND WITH SOMETIMES DAYS CAME ON WHICH EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GO WRONG WHEN THE STOVE SMOKED OR THE OVEN WOULDN'T HEAT PROPERLY
5044-30592-0031 WHEN CAKES FELL FLAT AND BREAD WAS SOUR AND PIES BEHAVED AS ONLY TOTALLY DEPRAVED PIES CAN WHEN SHE BURNED HER FINGERS AND FELT LIKE GIVING UP IN DESPAIR
5044-30592-0032 THE FRIENDS REALLY WORTH HAVING WERE STILL HERS HER MOTHER'S FACE HAD LOST ITS LOOK OF CARE AND HER BUSINESS WAS PROSPERING SHE WAS HOPEFUL AND WIDE AWAKE KEPT HER WITS ABOUT HER AND LOOKED OUT FOR HINTS AND LEARNED TO LAUGH OVER HER FAILURES
5044-30592-0033 DURING THE WINTER SHE AND HER MOTHER HAD MANAGED TO DO MOST OF THE WORK THEMSELVES HIRING LITTLE MARY ROBINSON NEXT DOOR ON ESPECIALLY BUSY DAYS
5044-30592-0034 BUT WHEN SPRING CAME LILIAN PREPARED TO OPEN UP HER SUMMER CAMPAIGN ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE MARY ROBINSON WAS HIRED FOR THE SEASON
5044-30592-0035 A SUMMER KITCHEN WAS BOARDED IN IN THE BACKYARD AND A NEW RANGE BOUGHT LILIAN BEGAN OPERATIONS WITH A STRIKING ADVERTISEMENT IN THE WILLINGTON NEWS AND AN ATTRACTIVE CIRCULAR SENT AROUND TO ALL HER PATRONS PICNICS AND SUMMER WEDDINGS WERE FREQUENT
5044-30592-0036 IN BREAD AND ROLLS HER TRADE WAS BRISK AND CONSTANT SHE ALSO TOOK ORDERS FOR PICKLES PRESERVES AND JELLIES AND THIS BECAME SUCH A FLOURISHING BRANCH THAT A SECOND ASSISTANT HAD TO BE HIRED
5044-30592-0037 IT WAS A CARDINAL RULE WITH LILIAN NEVER TO SEND OUT ANY ARTICLE THAT WAS NOT UP TO HER STANDARD SHE BORE THE LOSS OF HER FAILURES
5044-30592-0038 PROMPT AND PERFECT WAS HER MOTTO THE LONG HOT SUMMER DAYS WERE VERY TRYING AND SOMETIMES SHE GOT VERY TIRED OF IT ALL BUT WHEN ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER FIRST VENTURE SHE MADE UP HER ACCOUNTS SHE WAS WELL PLEASED TO BE SURE SHE HAD NOT MADE A FORTUNE BUT SHE HAD PAID ALL THEIR EXPENSES
