2967-4901-0000 DEDICATION TO SIR CHARLES GAVAN DUFFY MY DEAR SIR CHARLES I TAKE LEAVE TO DEDICATE THIS WORK TO YOU NOT MERELY BECAUSE YOUR NINETEEN YEARS OF POLITICAL AND LITERARY LIFE IN AUSTRALIA RENDER IT VERY FITTING
2967-4901-0001 AND HAVING TO DO WITH THE HISTORY OF PAST COLONIAL DAYS SHOULD BEAR YOUR NAME UPON ITS DEDICATORY PAGE BUT BECAUSE THE PUBLICATION OF MY BOOK IS DUE TO YOUR ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THE CONVICT OF FICTION HAS BEEN HITHERTO SHOWN ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OR AT THE END OF HIS CAREER
2967-4901-0002 CHARLES READE HAS DRAWN THE INTERIOR OF A HOUSE OF CORRECTION IN ENGLAND AND VICTOR HUGO HAS SHOWN HOW A FRENCH CONVICT FARES AFTER THE FULFILMENT OF HIS SENTENCE BUT NO WRITER SO FAR AS I AM AWARE
2967-4901-0003 HAS ATTEMPTED TO DEPICT THE DISMAL CONDITION OF A FELON DURING HIS TERM OF TRANSPORTATION I HAVE ENDEAVOURED IN HIS NATURAL LIFE TO SET FORTH THE WORKING AND THE RESULTS OF AN ENGLISH SYSTEM OF TRANSPORTATION CAREFULLY CONSIDERED AND CARRIED OUT UNDER OFFICIAL SUPERVISION
2967-4901-0004 AND TO ILLUSTRATE IN THE MANNER BEST CALCULATED AS I THINK TO ATTRACT GENERAL ATTENTION THE INEXPEDIENCY OF AGAIN ALLOWING OFFENDERS AGAINST THE LAW TO BE HERDED TOGETHER IN PLACES REMOTE FROM THE WHOLESOME INFLUENCE OF PUBLIC OPINION
2967-4901-0005 AND TO BE SUBMITTED TO A DISCIPLINE WHICH MUST NECESSARILY DEPEND FOR ITS JUST ADMINISTRATION UPON THE PERSONAL CHARACTER AND TEMPER OF THEIR GAOLERS YOUR CRITICAL FACULTY WILL DOUBTLESS FIND IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND ARTISTIC WORKING OF THIS BOOK MANY FAULTS
2967-4901-0006 I DO NOT THINK HOWEVER THAT YOU WILL DISCOVER ANY EXAGGERATIONS SOME OF THE EVENTS NARRATED ARE DOUBTLESS TRAGIC AND TERRIBLE BUT I HOLD IT NEEDFUL TO MY PURPOSE TO RECORD THEM FOR THEY ARE EVENTS WHICH HAVE ACTUALLY OCCURRED
2967-4901-0007 AND WHICH IF THE BLUNDERS WHICH PRODUCED THEM BE REPEATED MUST INFALLIBLY OCCUR AGAIN IT IS TRUE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE CEASED TO DEPORT THE CRIMINALS OF ENGLAND BUT THE METHOD OF PUNISHMENT OF WHICH THAT DEPORTATION WAS A PART IS STILL IN EXISTENCE
2967-4901-0008 AND WITHIN THE LAST YEAR FRANCE HAS ESTABLISHED AT NEW CALEDONIA A PENAL SETTLEMENT WHICH WILL IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS REPEAT IN ITS ANNALS THE HISTORY OF MACQUARIE HARBOUR AND OF NORFOLK ISLAND WITH THIS BRIEF PREFACE I BEG YOU TO ACCEPT THIS WORK

2967-4901-0066 AT HALF PAST NINE RICHARD DEVINE QUITTED HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE TO BEGIN THE NEW LIFE HE HAD CHOSEN AND SO
2967-4901-0067 THE FATHER AND SON APPROACHED EACH OTHER AS THE YOUNG MAN GAINED THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE HEATH HE MET SIR RICHARD RETURNING FROM THE VILLAGE
2967-4901-0068 AND HE WOULD HAVE SLUNK PAST IN THE GLOOM
2967-4901-0069 TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HOWEVER SIR RICHARD PASSED SWIFTLY ON WITH BODY BENT FORWARD AS ONE IN THE ACT OF FALLING AND WITH EYES UNCONSCIOUS OF SURROUNDINGS STARING STRAIGHT INTO THE DISTANCE HALF TERRIFIED AT THIS STRANGE APPEARANCE RICHARD HURRIED ONWARD
2967-4901-0070 AND AT A TURN OF THE PATH STUMBLED UPON SOMETHING WHICH HORRIBLY ACCOUNTED FOR THE CURIOUS ACTION OF THE OLD MAN A DEAD BODY LAY UPON ITS FACE IN THE HEATHER BESIDE IT WAS A HEAVY RIDING WHIP STAINED AT THE HANDLE WITH BLOOD AND AN OPEN POCKET BOOK
2967-4901-0071 RICHARD TOOK UP THE BOOK AND READ IN GOLD LETTERS ON THE COVER LORD BELLASIS THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE BODY AND RAISED IT THE SKULL HAD BEEN FRACTURED BY A BLOW BUT IT SEEMED THAT LIFE YET LINGERED

2967-4901-0073 IT SEEMED AN HOUR TO HIS EXCITED FANCY BEFORE HE SAW A LIGHT PASS ALONG THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE HE HAD QUITTED AND KNEW THAT SIR RICHARD HAD SAFELY REACHED HIS CHAMBER WITH SOME BEWILDERED INTENTION OF SUMMONING AID HE LEFT THE BODY AND MADE TOWARDS THE TOWN
2967-4901-0074 AS HE STEPPED OUT ON THE PATH HE HEARD VOICES AND PRESENTLY SOME DOZEN MEN ONE OF WHOM HELD A HORSE BURST OUT UPON HIM AND WITH SUDDEN FURY SEIZED AND FLUNG HIM TO THE GROUND
2967-4901-0075 AT FIRST THE YOUNG MAN SO RUDELY ASSAILED DID NOT COMPREHEND HIS OWN DANGER HIS MIND BENT UPON ONE HIDEOUS EXPLANATION OF THE CRIME DID NOT SEE ANOTHER OBVIOUS ONE WHICH HAD ALREADY OCCURRED TO THE MIND OF THE LANDLORD OF THE THREE SPANIARDS
