7959-109185-0000 THE HARRIER WAS SITTING ON HER NEWLY HATCHED YOUNG AND THE PAIR OF CROWS WERE FEEDING THEIRS FOR THE LAST TIME IT WAS THE TIME OF THE OWLS AND THE NIGHTINGALES
7959-109185-0001 SILENT AND WEARY THE CUCKOO CAME FROM THE MEADOW LAND TO THE BOG WHERE THE TWILIGHT ENVELOPED IT AND HID IT ON ITS BRANCH
7959-109185-0002 THE WATER BEGAN TO SPARKLE WITH STRONG BRIGHT COLOURS AND PATCHES OF YELLOW SCARLET AND BLUE FLOATED ABOUT SHOT WITH BRILLIANT FLAKES OF EMERALD AND PURPLE
7959-109185-0003 WHICH GAVE DARKENED REFLECTIONS OF THE BIRCH TOPS ONLY A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE ALL THE SLOPING BANKS OF THE BOG HAD BEEN HELD BY THE SUN IT SHONE UPON THE FLOWERS OF THE WILD CHERVIL
7959-109185-0004 AND UPON A NARROW STRIP OF ORANGE GRAVEL THAT HAD BEEN SCRAPED OUT OF ONE OF THE BANKS BUT NOW IT WAS GONE THE FULLY OPENED HAWTHORN FLOWERS RELUCTANTLY GAVE UP THEIR SUNSET BLUSH
7959-109185-0005 AND BEGINS TO SNARL A LARGE OTTER WITH LOW SET EARS CAUTIOUSLY RAISES ITS HEAD ABOVE THE STRIP OF GRAVEL
7959-109185-0006 AS IT STRETCHES ITS ROUND SHAGGY NECK OUT OVER THE RIDGE ABOVE THE DISTANT BANKS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOG THE FIRST GLOW OF THE FULL MOON PEEPS OUT
7959-109185-0007 LIKE A MONSTER TOADSTOOL IT GROWS UP OUT OF THE HORIZON SENDING UP A CLOUD OF PURPLE INTO THE AIR UP AND UP IT GOES AND WHEN ALMOST HALF ITS DISC IS VISIBLE
7959-109185-0008 A GROUP OF FIRS WHOSE TOPS STAND OUT AGAINST IT
7959-109185-0009 TO A GIANT POPPY JUST UNFOLDING FOR A MOMENT THE FLOWER STANDS OUT PERFECT LARGE AND ROUND AT THE END OF ITS SLENDER BLACK STALK
7959-109185-0010 AND THEN THE ILLUSION IS SHATTERED FROM A TOADSTOOL THE POPPY HAS TURNED INTO A MOON THEN THE OTTER COMES RIGHT UP OUT OF THE EARTH WITH BODY AND TAIL AND FOUR LEGS
7959-109185-0011 AND SHUFFLES DOWN THE SLOPE A COUPLE OF HERONS FISHING AT THE EDGE OF THE BOG BEND THEIR NECKS AND MAKE OFF WITH HOARSE SHRILL TRUMPETINGS AND A HERD OF SPLASHING HEIFERS
7959-109185-0012 SCENTING THE APPROACH OF A BEAST OF PREY BEGIN TO GROWL AND SNORT THE OTTER CAME TO THE BOG EVERY TWO OR THREE MONTHS WHEN IT WAS TIRED OF HUNTING FISH IN THE LAKE
7959-109185-0013 A ROVER'S BLOOD FLOWED IN ITS VEINS NATURE HAD ENDOWED IT WITH A PECULIARLY ACTIVE POWER OF ASSIMILATION WHICH WAS PROBABLY NECESSARY IF IT WAS TO KEEP WARM IN THE COLD WATER
7959-109185-0014 IT NEEDED DAILY ITS OWN WEIGHT IN FISH AND THEREFORE HAD TO BE INCESSANTLY CHANGING ITS HUNTING GROUND IT WAS TIMID AND SUSPICIOUS BUT A GREAT GLUTTON
7959-109185-0015 WHICH IT USED ESPECIALLY TO CATCH IN THE BOGS WERE SOMEWHAT DRY IT IS TRUE BUT AFTER ALL ONE COULD NOT HAVE SALMON AND TROUT EVERY DAY
7959-109185-0016 AND REACHED THE LARGEST OF THE BIG POOLS IT ALLOWED ITSELF TO GLIDE NOISELESSLY FROM ITS SLIP A PATH TRODDEN IN THE GRASS INTO ITS TRUE ELEMENT A FEW MINUTES LATER
7959-109185-0017 THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL DISTURBANCE IN THE WATER WHICH SPLASHED HIGH UP ABOUT THE DUNES AND FOAMED OVER THE BANKS A WILD CHASE WAS GOING ON IN THE DEPTHS AND WHERE IT PASSED THE RUSHES BOWED THEIR SHEAVES
7959-109185-0018 AND THE FLAGS THEIR FANS BLACK MUD WAS STIRRED UP IN WHIRLPOOLS SEETHING BUBBLES CAME TO THE SURFACE AND BURST THE OTTER WITH A NEWLY CAUGHT FISH IN ITS MOUTH
7959-109185-0019 HAD BEEN ON ITS WAY OUT TO A LITTLE ISLAND INTENDING TO HAVE ITS MEAL UNDER A SALLOW WHEN IT WAS SUDDENLY ATTACKED AND ROBBED OF ITS PREY IT CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE INDISTINCT OUTLINE OF A GREAT FISH
7959-109185-0020 AND EXASPERATED AT SUCH AUDACITY DETERMINED TO GO IN CHASE OF THE ROBBER AN ATTEMPT TO GET BENEATH GRIM IN ORDER TO SEIZE HER ROUND THE GILLS OR BY THE BELLY WAS UNSUCCESSFUL
7959-109185-0021 AT THE DECISIVE MOMENT GRIM HAD TURNED ASIDE SO THAT THE OTTER HAD TO SET ITS TEETH WHERE IT COULD AND IT NEEDED A WELL PLACED GRIP TO HOLD SUCH A GIANT FISH
7959-109185-0022 THE INSTANT IT HAS TAKEN HOLD A LITTLE BEHIND THE NECK GRIM DARTS INTO DEEP WATER WITH HER ASSAILANT THE OTTER BACKS EXTENDS HIS FORE AND HIND LEGS FAR OUT FROM HIS BODY
7959-109185-0023 AND SPREADS HIS WEB SO AS TO OFFER AS MUCH RESISTANCE AS POSSIBLE JUST AS THE WEASEL LETS ITSELF BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE HARE IN WHOSE NECK IT HAS FIXED ITSELF
7959-109185-0024 SO NOW THE OTTER ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DRAGGED THROUGH THE BOG BY THE LYNX OF THE WATERS GRIM SOON SEES THAT THIS PACE IS WEARING OUT HER STRENGTH AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT
7959-109185-0025 AS SHE DOES SO SHE FEELS AS IF AN EEL WERE WINDING ITS PLIANT BODY ROUND HER CHEST SHE ROLLS ROUND UNABLE TO USE HER FINS
7959-109185-0026 AND SETS OFF WITH SUDDEN TWISTS AND LEAPS FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE SURFACE TURNING SO SUDDENLY THAT THE FISH SNATCHER'S BODY SWINGS OUT AND HANGS DOWN IN THE WATER BUT THE OTTER ONLY KEEPS A FIRMER HOLD
7959-109185-0027 HE IS USED TO THESE DESPERATE RALLIES WHICH ALWAYS BECOME FIERCER AND MORE VIOLENT AS THE QUARRY IS ON THE POINT OF GIVING IN HE TAKES CARE HOWEVER IN TURNING NOT TO LET ANY OF HIS LEGS HANG IN FRONT OF THE PIKE'S MOUTH
7959-109185-0028 HE IS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE TEETH OF THE FRESH WATER SHARK UP AND DOWN THE TWO WELL MATCHED OPPONENTS DIVE INCESSANTLY
7959-109185-0029 WHENEVER GRIM GOES TO THE SURFACE A PUFFING AND GROWLING IS HEARD THE OTTER HASTILY GASPS FOR BREATH AND TIGHTENS HIS HOLD WITH HIS FORE CLAWS BUT WHEN THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY DOWN TO THE DEPTHS
7959-109185-0030 AND AIR BUBBLES LIKE SILVER BEADS ROLL THROUGH THE WATER BEHIND HIM HE HAS ONLY TO HOLD ON AND LET HIMSELF GO ONCE GRIM IS LUCKY AN OLD SNAG STICKS UP IN THE WATER
7959-109185-0031 AND IN TURNING THE OTTER'S BODY IS DASHED AGAINST IT IT SENDS A SHOCK THROUGH THE ANIMAL BUT AS GRIM FOR THE MOMENT HAS EXHAUSTED HER ENERGY AND SUCCUMBED TO ONE OF THE WELL KNOWN FITS OF WEAKNESS COMMON TO HER SPECIES
7959-109185-0032 THE OTTER ONCE MORE APPARENTLY GETS THE UPPER HAND THUS WITH VARYING FORTUNES THE BATTLE RAGES FOR SOME TIME THEY LIE FIGHTING ON THE SURFACE
7959-109185-0033 A GOLDEN STREAKED SLIMY SCALY FISH TWISTED INTO A KNOT WITH A DARK HAIRY FURRED BODY ONCE MORE THERE IS A PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING
7959-109185-0034 UNOBSERVED BY GRIM WHO HAS JUST FALLEN INTO ONE OF HER APATHETIC FITS THE OTTER ENDEAVOURS CAREFULLY TO FLOAT THE PIKE UP UNDER ONE OF THE LARGE MOUNDS
7959-109185-0035 IN ORDER TO DRAG HER UP WITH AN EFFORT OF STRENGTH ON TO DRY LAND BUT THE ATTEMPT FAILS UTTERLY HE IS SIMPLY UNABLE TO MANAGE SO GREAT A LOAD
7959-109185-0036 NOW GRIM'S STRENGTH RETURNS ONCE MORE WITH A POWERFUL STROKE OF HER TAIL SHE DISAPPEARS WITH LIGHTNING RAPIDITY FROM THE SURFACE AND GOES TO THE BOTTOM WITH HER RIDER WHOSE MERRY GO ROUND JAUNT MAKES HIS HEAD SWIM
7959-109185-0037 SHE IS TRYING TO GET HOLD OF HIS LEG OR BODY AND THEREFORE TWISTS ROUND WITH HIM SO THAT HE FLAPS LIKE A LOOSE PIECE OF STRAP ON AN AXLE BUT SHE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY SUPPLE TO REACH HIM HER BACK ACHES HER FLEXOR MUSCLES HURT
7959-109185-0038 HER INGENUITY AND HER ENDURANCE TO THE EXTREME TEST DOWN ON THE BOTTOM STICKING OUT FROM THE BANK ARE THE ROOTS OF THE WILLOW BUSHES ON THE EDGE IN HER MAD RUSH DOWN GRIM HAS COME NEAR THESE
7959-109185-0039 AND INSTINCTIVELY SEEKS SHELTER BENEATH THEM AT FULL SPEED SHE RUNS HER LONG BODY INTO THE NETWORK AND STICKS FAST RAPIDLY TWISTING HER TAIL SCREW BOTH AHEAD AND ASTERN
7959-109185-0040 THE OTTER TREADS WATER NOW ON THE RIGHT NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HER AND TRIES BY UTILIZING THE ROOTS AS STEPS TO LIFT HER UP WITH HIM BUT IN VAIN HE CANNOT EVEN STIR THE HUGE FISH
7959-109185-0041 HIS TEETH ARE STILL FAR FROM HAVING FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH IT SEEMS AS IF SHORT AND ROUNDED AS THEY ARE THEY CANNOT REACH THE BOTTOM BUT HE MAKES TREMENDOUS EXERTIONS WHIPPING HIS TAIL IN UNDER THE PEAT BANK
7959-109185-0042 WHILE WITH HIS HIND PAWS HE SEEKS FOR SUPPORT IN CLEFTS AND CRACKS SUDDENLY HE FEELS ONE OF HIS FEET SEIZED THE GRASP TIGHTENS SO THAT HIS WHOLE LEG ACHES HE TRIES TO DRAW IN HIS FOOT
7959-109185-0043 BUT IT IS HELD IMMOVABLE A MONSTER CRAYFISH THAT HAS BECOME SO STIFF WITH AGE THAT IT CAN SCARCELY MANAGE TO STRIKE A PROPER BLOW WITH ITS TAIL HAS MADE FOR ITSELF IN FEAR OF GRIM
7959-109185-0044 A RELIABLE PLACE OF REFUGE IN THE HOLE FOR A LONG TIME IT HAS PATIENTLY FOLLOWED THE BATTLE THROUGH ITS FEELERS AND HOPED THAT SOME MORSEL WOULD FALL TO ITS HUNGRY STOMACH NOW WITH GRATITUDE TO PROVIDENCE
7959-109185-0045 IT CLOSES ITS GREAT CLAW UPON THE WARM BLOODED FISHER A GROWING UNEASINESS STEALS OVER THE OTTER HE HAD ONCE BEEN CAUGHT BY THE TIP OF ONE CLAW IN AN OTTER TRAP
7959-109185-0046 AND HIS EYES SEEM ON THE POINT OF BURSTING UP UP WITH OR WITHOUT HIS PREY HE HAS LET GO OF GRIM AND NOW MAKES HIS ESCAPE FROM THE HOLE WITH SO SUDDEN A JERK THAT THE OLD CRAYFISH ACCOMPANIES HIM
7959-109185-0047 AND AS HE APPROACHES THE SURFACE AND FINDS THE BLESSED LIGHT BEATING MORE AND MORE STRONGLY UPON THE MUD ABOUT HIS EYES HE HASTENS HIS FLIGHT UNTIL WITH AN EAGER SNIFF HE REACHES THE SURFACE
7959-109185-0048 GRIM IS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND AS THE OTTER LANDS THERE IS A LOUD SPLASH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL OVER WITH THE BROWN BEAST
7959-109185-0049 IF THE OLD CRAYFISH ON ITS WAY DOWN FROM THE SURFACE WHERE IT HAD AT LAST LET GO ITS HOLD HAD NOT DROPPED LIKE A STONE STRAIGHT INTO GRIM'S MOUTH
7959-109185-0050 THE WOUND THAT THE OLD GIANT PIKE HAD RECEIVED WAS NOT A DANGEROUS ONE TRUE THERE WERE TWO ROWS OF DEEP CUTS
7959-109185-0051 MADE BY A PAIR OF THICK ROUND TOOTHED JAWS IN THE FLESH ON ONE SIDE OF HER BACK BUT THEY HEALED LIKE SO MANY OTHERS THAT SHE HAD HAD IN HER TIME HER BACK HOWEVER WAS TENDER FOR DAYS AFTER
7959-109185-0052 AND SHE FOUND IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO LEAP THE IMPUDENT FOUR FOOTED FISHER NEVER WENT HUNTING AGAIN IN HER WATER HOLE
