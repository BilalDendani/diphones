6538-81859-0000 THEY WAITED YET A LITTLE WHILE LONGER AND THEN THE BOOM OF A HEAVY GUN IN THE FOREST TOLD THEM THAT THE ENEMY WAS ADVANCING TO BEGIN THE BATTLE AFRESH
6538-81859-0001 YET BEAUREGARD AND HIS GENERALS WERE STILL SANGUINE OF COMPLETING THE VICTORY THEIR SCOUTS AND SKIRMISHERS HAD FAILED TO DISCOVER THAT THE ENTIRE ARMY OF BUELL ALSO WAS NOW IN FRONT OF THEM BRAGG WAS GATHERING HIS DIVISION ON THE LEFT TO HURL IT LIKE A THUNDERBOLT UPON GRANT'S SHATTERED BRIGADES
6538-81859-0002 HARDEE AND THE BISHOP GENERAL WERE IN THE CENTER AND BRECKINRIDGE LED THE RIGHT BUT AS THEY MOVED FORWARD TO ATTACK THE UNION TROOPS CAME OUT TO MEET THEM NELSON HAD OCCUPIED THE HIGH GROUND BETWEEN LICK AND OWL CREEKS
6538-81859-0003 AND HIS AND THE SOUTHERN TROOPS MET IN A FIERCE CLASH SHORTLY AFTER DAWN BEAUREGARD DRAWN BY THE FIRING AT THAT POINT AND NOTICING THE COURAGE AND TENACITY WITH WHICH THE NORTHERN TROOPS HELD THEIR GROUND SENDING IN VOLLEY AFTER VOLLEY
6538-81859-0004 WEARY THOUGH THE SOUTHERN SOLDIERS WERE THEIR ATTACK WAS MADE WITH UTMOST FIRE AND VIGOR A LONG AND FURIOUS COMBAT ENSUED A SOUTHERN DIVISION UNDER CHEATHAM RUSHED TO THE HELP OF THEIR FELLOWS
6538-81859-0005 FRESH AND WITH UNBROKEN RANKS NOT A MAN WOUNDED OR MISSING THEY HAD ENTERED THE BATTLE AND BOTH GRANT AND BUELL AS WELL AS THEIR DIVISION COMMANDERS EXPECTED AN EASY VICTORY WHERE THE ARMY OF THE OHIO STOOD BUELL TO HIS AMAZEMENT SAW HIMSELF REDUCED TO THE DEFENSIVE
6538-81859-0006 HE AND GRANT HAD RECKONED THAT THE DECIMATED BRIGADES OF THE SOUTH COULD NOT STAND AT ALL BEFORE HIM BUT JUST AS ON THE FIRST DAY THEY CAME ON WITH THE FIERCE REBEL YELL HURLING THEMSELVES UPON SUPERIOR NUMBERS TAKING THE CANNON OF THEIR ENEMY LOSING THEM AND RETAKING THEM AND LOSING THEM AGAIN BUT NEVER YIELDING
6538-81859-0007 THE GREAT CONFLICT INCREASED IN VIOLENCE BUELL A MAN OF IRON COURAGE SAW THAT HIS SOLDIERS MUST FIGHT TO THE UTTERMOST NOT FOR VICTORY ONLY BUT EVEN TO WARD OFF DEFEAT THE DAWN WAS NOW FAR ADVANCED
6538-81859-0008 THE RAIN HAD CEASED AND THE SUN AGAIN SHOT DOWN SHEAVES OF FIERY RAYS UPON A VAST LOW CLOUD OF FIRE AND SMOKE IN WHICH THOUSANDS OF MEN MET IN DESPERATE COMBAT NINE O'CLOCK CAME
6538-81859-0009 BUT FOR THREE HOURS BUELL HAD BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM BEING SWEPT AWAY THE SOUTHERN TROOPS SEEMED ANIMATED BY THAT EXTRAORDINARY BATTLE FEVER AND ABSOLUTE CONTEMPT OF DEATH WHICH DISTINGUISHED THEM SO OFTEN DURING THIS WAR
6538-81859-0010 BUELL'S ARMY WAS DRIVEN IN ON BOTH FLANKS AND ONLY THE CENTER HELD FAST IT BEGAN TO SEEM POSSIBLE THAT THE SOUTH DESPITE HER REDUCED RANKS MIGHT YET DEFEAT BOTH NORTHERN ARMIES ANOTHER BATTERY DASHED UP TO THE RELIEF OF THE MEN IN BLUE
6538-81859-0011 IT WAS CHARGED AT ONCE BY THE MEN IN GRAY SO FIERCELY THAT THE GUNNERS WERE GLAD TO ESCAPE WITH THEIR GUNS AND ONCE MORE THE WILD REBEL YELL OF TRIUMPH SWELLED THROUGH THE SOUTHERN FOREST DICK STANDING WITH HIS COMRADES ON ONE OF THE RIDGES THAT THEY HAD DEFENDED SO WELL LISTENED TO THE ROAR OF CONFLICT ON THE WING
6538-81859-0012 EVER INCREASING IN VOLUME AND WATCHED THE VAST CLOUDS OF SMOKE GATHERING OVER THE FOREST HE COULD SEE FROM WHERE HE STOOD THE FLASH OF RIFLE FIRE AND THE BLAZE OF CANNON AND BOTH EYE AND EAR TOLD HIM THAT THE BATTLE WAS NOT MOVING BACK UPON THE SOUTH
6538-81859-0013 IT SEEMS THAT WE DO NOT MAKE HEADWAY SIR HE SAID TO COLONEL WINCHESTER WHO ALSO STOOD BY HIM LOOKING AND LISTENING NOT THAT I CAN PERCEIVE REPLIED THE COLONEL AND YET WITH THE RUSH OF FORTY THOUSAND FRESH TROOPS OF OURS UPON THE FIELD I DEEMED VICTORY QUICK AND EASY
6538-81859-0014 HOW THE BATTLE GROWS HOW THE SOUTH FIGHTS COLONEL WINCHESTER WALKED AWAY PRESENTLY AND JOINED SHERMAN WHO WAS EAGERLY WATCHING THE MIGHTY CONFLICT INTO WHICH HE KNEW THAT HIS OWN WORN AND SHATTERED TROOPS MUST SOONER OR LATER BE DRAWN
6538-81859-0015 HE WALKED UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF HIS LINES SAYING LITTLE BUT SEEING EVERYTHING HIS TALL FORM WAS SEEN BY ALL HIS MEN HE TOO MUST HAVE FELT A SINGULAR THRILL AT THAT MOMENT HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT HIS STAR WAS RISING
6538-81859-0016 HE MORE THAN ANY OTHER WITH HIS VALOR PENETRATING MIND AND DECISION HAD SAVED THE NORTHERN ARMY FROM COMPLETE DESTRUCTION THE FIRST DAY AT SHILOH HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO AVERT DEFEAT BUT HE HAD PREVENTED UTTER RUIN HIS DIVISION ALONE HAD HELD TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF THE SOUTHERN ATTACK UNTIL NIGHT CAME
6538-81859-0017 BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN ACHIEVE ANY BIG VICTORY LOOK THERE'S GENERAL GRANT HIMSELF GRANT WAS PASSING ALONG HIS WHOLE LINE WHILE LEAVING THE MAIN BATTLE TO BUELL HE RETAINED GENERAL COMMAND AND WATCHED EVERYTHING
6538-81859-0018 HE TOO OBSERVED THE FAILURE OF BUELL'S ARMY TO DRIVE THE ENEMY BEFORE THEM AND HE MUST HAVE FELT A SINKING OF THE HEART BUT HE DID NOT SHOW IT INSTEAD HE SPOKE ONLY OF VICTORY WHEN HE MADE ANY COMMENT AT ALL AND SENT THE MEMBERS OF HIS STAFF TO MAKE NEW ARRANGEMENTS
6538-81859-0019 HE MUST BRING INTO ACTION EVERY GUN AND MAN HE HAD OR HE WOULD YET LOSE IT WAS NOW TEN O'CLOCK AND THE NEW BATTLE HAD LASTED WITH THE UTMOST FURY AND DESPERATION FOR FOUR HOURS DICK AFTER GENERAL GRANT RODE ON FELT AS IF A SUDDEN THRILL HAD RUN THROUGH THE WHOLE ARMY
6538-81859-0020 HE SAW MEN RISING FROM THE EARTH AND TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS HE SAW GUNNERS GATHERING AROUND THEIR GUNS AND MAKING READY WITH THE AMMUNITION HE KNEW THE REMAINS OF GRANT'S ARMY WERE ABOUT TO MARCH UPON THE ENEMY HELPING THE ARMY OF THE OHIO TO ACHIEVE THE TASK THAT HAD PROVED SO GREAT
6538-81859-0021 SHERMAN MC CLERNAND AND OTHER GENERALS NOW PASSED AMONG THEIR TROOPS CHEERING THEM TELLING THEM THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO WIN BACK WHAT THEY HAD LOST THE DAY BEFORE AND THAT VICTORY WAS SURE THEY CALLED UPON THEM FOR ANOTHER GREAT EFFORT AND A SHOUT ROLLED ALONG THE LINE OF WILLING SOLDIERS
6538-81859-0022 SHERMAN'S WHOLE DIVISION NOW RAISED ITSELF UP AND RUSHED AT THE ENEMY DICK AND HIS COMRADES IN THE FRONT OF THEIR OWN REGIMENT THE WHOLE NORTHERN LINE WAS NOW ENGAGED GRANT TRUE TO HIS RESOLUTION HAD HURLED EVERY MAN AND EVERY GUN UPON HIS FOE
6538-81859-0023 THE SOUTHERN GENERALS FELT THE IMMENSE WEIGHT OF THE NUMBERS THAT WERE NOW DRIVING DOWN UPON THEM THEIR DECIMATED RANKS COULD NOT WITHSTAND THE CHARGE OF TWO ARMIES IN THE CENTER WHERE BUELL'S MEN HAVING STOOD FAST FROM THE FIRST WERE NOW ADVANCING
6538-81859-0024 THEY WERE COMPELLED TO GIVE WAY AND LOST SEVERAL GUNS ON THE WINGS THE HEAVY NORTHERN BRIGADES WERE ADVANCING ALSO AND THE WHOLE SOUTHERN LINE WAS PUSHED BACK SO MUCH INFERIOR WAS THE SOUTH IN NUMBERS THAT HER ENEMY BEGAN TO OVERLAP HER ON THE FLANKS ALSO
6538-81859-0025 A TREMENDOUS SHOUT OF EXULTATION SWEPT THROUGH THE NORTHERN RANKS AS THEY FELT THEMSELVES ADVANCING THE PROMISES OF THEIR GENERALS WERE COMING TRUE AND THERE IS NOTHING SWEETER THAN VICTORY AFTER DEFEAT FORTUNE AFTER FROWNING UPON HER SO LONG WAS NOW SMILING UPON THE NORTH
6538-81859-0026 THE EXULTANT CHEER SWEPT THROUGH THE RANKS AGAIN AND BACK CAME THE DEFIANT REBEL YELL A YOUNG SOLDIER OFTEN FEELS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH AS TRUE INSTINCT AS A GENERAL DICK NOW KNEW THAT THE NORTH WOULD RECOVER THE FIELD AND THAT THE SOUTH CUT DOWN FEARFULLY
6538-81859-0027 THOUGH HAVING PERFORMED PRODIGIES OF VALOR MUST FIGHT TO SAVE HERSELF HE FELT THAT THE RESISTANCE IN FRONT OF THEM WAS NO LONGER INVINCIBLE HE SAW IN THE FLASH OF THE FIRING THAT THE SOUTHERN RANKS WERE THIN VERY THIN AND HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO BREAK IN THEIR OWN ADVANCE
6538-81859-0028 ONCE MORE THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH IN THE WOODS LOOKED DOWN UPON ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY CONFLICTS OF THE WHOLE WAR IF SHERMAN COULD BREAK THROUGH THE SOUTHERN LINE HERE BEAUREGARD'S WHOLE ARMY WOULD BE LOST BUT THE SOUTHERN SOLDIERS WERE CAPABLE OF ANOTHER AND A MIGHTY EFFORT
6538-81859-0029 THEY GATHERED TOGETHER THEIR SHATTERED BRIGADES AND HURLED THEM LIKE A THUNDERBOLT UPON THE UNION LEFT AND CENTER THE SHOCK WAS TERRIFIC SHERMAN WITH ALL HIS STAUNCHNESS AND THE VALOR OF HIS MEN WAS COMPELLED TO GIVE WAY MC CLERNAND TOO REELED BACK OTHERS WERE DRIVEN IN ALSO
6538-81859-0030 WHOLE BRIGADES AND REGIMENTS WERE CUT TO PIECES OR THROWN IN CONFUSION THE SOUTHERNERS CUT A WIDE GAP IN THE NORTHERN ARMY THROUGH WHICH THEY RUSHED IN TRIUMPH HOLDING THE CORINTH ROAD AGAINST EVERY ATTACK AND MAKING THEIR REAR SECURE
6538-81859-0031 THE BUGLES SOUNDED THE RETREAT AND RELUCTANTLY THEY GAVE UP THE GROUND WHICH THEY HAD WON WITH SO MUCH COURAGE AND DARING THEY RETREATED RATHER AS VICTORS THAN DEFEATED MEN PRESENTING A BRISTLING FRONT TO THE ENEMY UNTIL THEIR REGIMENTS WERE LOST IN THE FOREST
6538-81859-0032 AND BEATING OFF EVERY ATTEMPT OF SKIRMISHERS OR CAVALRY TO MOLEST THEM IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE LAST SHOT WAS FIRED AND THE SOUTHERN ARMY AT ITS LEISURE RESUMED ITS MARCH TOWARD CORINTH PROTECTED ON THE FLANKS BY ITS CAVALRY
6538-81859-0033 AND CARRYING WITH IT THE ASSURANCE THAT ALTHOUGH NOT VICTORIOUS OVER TWO ARMIES IT HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS OVER ONE AND HAD STRUCK THE MOST STUNNING BLOW YET KNOWN IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHEN THE LAST OF THE SOUTHERN REGIMENTS DISAPPEARED IN THE DEEP WOODS
6538-81859-0034 DICK AND MANY OF THOSE AROUND HIM SANK EXHAUSTED UPON THE GROUND EVEN HAD THEY BEEN ORDERED TO FOLLOW THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INCAPABLE OF IT COMPLETE NERVOUS COLLAPSE FOLLOWED SUCH DAYS AND NIGHTS AS THOSE THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED NOR DID GRANT AND BUELL WISH TO PURSUE
6538-81859-0035 THEIR ARMIES HAD BEEN TOO TERRIBLY SHAKEN TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTACK NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEIR MEN HAD FALLEN AND THE DEAD AND WOUNDED STILL LAY SCATTERED WIDELY THROUGH THE WOODS THE SOUTH HAD LOST ALMOST AS MANY NEARLY A THIRD OF HER ARMY HAD BEEN KILLED OR WOUNDED IN THE BATTLE
6538-81859-0036 AND YET THEY RETIRED IN GOOD ORDER SHOWING THE DESPERATE VALOR OF THESE SONS OF HERS THE DOUBLE ARMY WHICH HAD SAVED ITSELF BUT WHICH HAD YET BEEN UNABLE TO DESTROY ITS ENEMY SLEPT THAT NIGHT IN THE RECOVERED CAMP THE GENERALS DISCUSSED IN SUBDUED TONES THEIR NARROW ESCAPE
