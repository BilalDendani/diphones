4492-8904-0000 HE LEFT HER AT THE DOOR OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE AS HE RECEDED AND WAS CLASPED OUT OF SIGHT BY THE FILMY SHADES HE IMPRESSED GRACE AS A MAN WHO HARDLY APPERTAINED TO HER EXISTENCE AT ALL
4492-8904-0001 CLEVERER GREATER THAN HERSELF ONE OUTSIDE HER MENTAL ORBIT AS SHE CONSIDERED HIM HE SEEMED TO BE HER RULER RATHER THAN HER EQUAL PROTECTOR AND DEAR FAMILIAR FRIEND THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD EXPERIENCED AT HIS WISH
4492-8904-0002 THE SHOCK GIVEN TO HER GIRLISH SENSIBILITIES BY HIS IRREVERENT VIEWS OF MARRIAGE TOGETHER WITH THE SURE AND NEAR APPROACH OF THE DAY FIXED FOR COMMITTING HER FUTURE TO HIS KEEPING MADE HER SO RESTLESS
4492-8904-0003 SHE ROSE WHEN THE SPARROWS BEGAN TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOF HOLES SAT ON THE FLOOR OF HER ROOM IN THE DIM LIGHT AND BY AND BY PEEPED OUT BEHIND THE WINDOW CURTAINS IT WAS EVEN NOW DAY OUT OF DOORS
4492-8904-0004 THOUGH THE TONES OF MORNING WERE FEEBLE AND WAN AND IT WAS LONG BEFORE THE SUN WOULD BE PERCEPTIBLE IN THIS OVERSHADOWED VALE NOT A SOUND CAME FROM ANY OF THE OUT HOUSES AS YET THE TREE TRUNKS THE ROAD
4492-8904-0005 THE OUT BUILDINGS THE GARDEN EVERY OBJECT WORE THAT ASPECT OF MESMERIC FIXITY
4492-8904-0006 LENDS TO SUCH SCENES OUTSIDE HER WINDOW HELPLESS IMMOBILITY SEEMED TO BE COMBINED WITH INTENSE CONSCIOUSNESS A MEDITATIVE INERTNESS POSSESSED ALL THINGS OPPRESSIVELY CONTRASTING WITH HER OWN ACTIVE EMOTIONS
4492-8904-0007 BEYOND THE ROAD WERE SOME COTTAGE ROOFS AND ORCHARDS OVER THESE ROOFS AND OVER THE APPLE TREES BEHIND
4492-8904-0008 WAS THE HOUSE YET OCCUPIED BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND THE ROUGH CAST FRONT SHOWING WHITELY THROUGH ITS CREEPERS THE WINDOW SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED THE BEDROOM CURTAINS CLOSELY DRAWN AND NOT THE THINNEST COIL OF SMOKE ROSE FROM THE RUGGED CHIMNEYS
4492-8904-0009 SOMETHING BROKE THE STILLNESS THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE SHE WAS GAZING AT OPENED SOFTLY AND THERE CAME OUT INTO THE PORCH A FEMALE FIGURE WRAPPED IN A LARGE SHAWL BENEATH WHICH WAS VISIBLE
4492-8904-0010 THE WHITE SKIRT OF A LONG LOOSE GARMENT A GRAY ARM STRETCHING FROM WITHIN THE PORCH ADJUSTED THE SHAWL OVER THE WOMAN'S SHOULDERS IT WAS WITHDRAWN AND DISAPPEARED THE DOOR CLOSING BEHIND HER
4492-8904-0011 THE WOMAN WENT QUICKLY DOWN THE BOX EDGED PATH BETWEEN THE RASPBERRIES AND CURRANTS AND AS SHE WALKED HER WELL DEVELOPED FORM AND GAIT BETRAYED HER INDIVIDUALITY
4492-8904-0012 TIM TANGS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN SHE ENTERED THE SHELTER OF THE TALL HEDGE AND ONLY THE TOP OF HER HEAD COULD BE SEEN HASTENING IN THE DIRECTION OF HER OWN DWELLING
4492-8904-0013 THE SLEEVE OF A DRESSING GOWN WHICH MISTER FITZPIERS HAD BEEN WEARING ON HER OWN MEMORABLE VISIT TO HIM HER FACE FIRED RED SHE HAD JUST BEFORE THOUGHT OF DRESSING HERSELF AND TAKING A LONELY WALK UNDER THE TREES
4492-8904-0014 PREPARING DOWN STAIRS THOUGH ON ROUSING HERSELF TO ROBE AND DESCEND SHE FOUND THAT THE SUN WAS THROWING HIS RAYS COMPLETELY OVER THE TREE TOPS A PROGRESS OF NATURAL PHENOMENA DENOTING THAT AT LEAST THREE HOURS HAD ELAPSED
4492-8904-0015 WHEN ATTIRED SHE SEARCHED ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR HER FATHER SHE FOUND HIM AT LAST IN THE GARDEN STOOPING TO EXAMINE THE POTATOES FOR SIGNS OF DISEASE HEARING HER RUSTLE HE STOOD UP AND STRETCHED HIS BACK AND ARMS SAYING
4492-8904-0016 I CONGRATULATE YE IT IS ONLY A MONTH TO DAY TO THE TIME SHE DID NOT ANSWER BUT WITHOUT LIFTING HER DRESS WADED BETWEEN THE DEWY ROWS OF TALL POTATO GREEN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PLOT WHERE HE WAS
4492-8904-0017 I HAVE BEEN THINKING VERY MUCH ABOUT MY POSITION THIS MORNING EVER SINCE IT WAS LIGHT SHE BEGAN EXCITEDLY AND TREMBLING SO THAT SHE COULD HARDLY STAND AND I FEEL IT IS A FALSE ONE I WISH NOT TO MARRY MISTER FITZPIERS
4492-8904-0018 I WISH NOT TO MARRY ANYBODY BUT I'LL MARRY GILES WINTERBORNE IF YOU SAY I MUST AS AN ALTERNATIVE HER FATHER'S FACE SETTLED INTO RIGIDITY HE TURNED PALE AND CAME DELIBERATELY OUT OF THE PLOT BEFORE HE ANSWERED HER
4492-8904-0019 SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM LOOK SO INCENSED BEFORE NOW HEARKEN TO ME HE SAID THERE'S A TIME FOR A WOMAN TO ALTER HER MIND AND THERE'S A TIME WHEN SHE CAN NO LONGER ALTER IT IF SHE HAS ANY RIGHT EYE TO HER PARENTS HONOR
4492-8904-0020 AND THE SEEMLINESS OF THINGS
4492-8904-0021 I WON'T SAY TO YE YOU SHALL MARRY HIM BUT I WILL SAY THAT IF YOU REFUSE I SHALL FOREVER BE ASHAMED AND A WEARY OF YE AS A DAUGHTER AND SHALL LOOK UPON YOU AS THE HOPE OF MY LIFE NO MORE
4492-8904-0022 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LIFE AND WHAT IT CAN BRING FORTH AND HOW YOU OUGHT TO ACT TO LEAD UP TO BEST ENDS OH YOU ARE AN UNGRATEFUL MAID GRACE YOU'VE SEEN THAT FELLOW GILES AND HE HAS GOT OVER YE
4492-8904-0023 THAT'S WHERE THE SECRET LIES I'LL WARRANT ME NO FATHER NO IT IS NOT GILES IT IS SOMETHING I CANNOT TELL YOU OF WELL MAKE FOOLS OF US ALL MAKE US LAUGHING STOCKS BREAK IT OFF HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
4492-8904-0024 BUT WHO KNOWS OF THE ENGAGEMENT AS YET HOW CAN BREAKING IT DISGRACE YOU MELBURY THEN BY DEGREES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD MENTIONED THE ENGAGEMENT
4492-8904-0025 TILL SHE PERCEIVED THAT IN HIS RESTLESSNESS AND PRIDE HE HAD PUBLISHED IT EVERYWHERE
4492-8904-0026 YOU'VE HAD A TIFF A LOVERS TIFF THAT'S ALL I SUPPOSE IT IS SOME WOMAN
4492-8904-0027 DON'T TELL ME NOW DO YOU BIDE HERE I'LL SEND FITZPIERS TO YOU I SAW HIM SMOKING IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE BUT A MINUTE BY GONE HE WENT OFF HASTILY OUT OF THE GARDEN GATE AND DOWN THE LANE BUT SHE WOULD NOT STAY WHERE SHE WAS
4492-8904-0028 AND EDGING THROUGH A SLIT IN THE GARDEN FENCE WALKED AWAY INTO THE WOOD JUST ABOUT HERE THE TREES WERE LARGE AND WIDE APART AND THERE WAS NO UNDERGROWTH SO THAT SHE COULD BE SEEN TO SOME DISTANCE A SYLPH LIKE GREENISH WHITE CREATURE
4492-8904-0029 AS TONED BY THE SUNLIGHT AND LEAFAGE SHE HEARD A FOOT FALL CRUSHING DEAD LEAVES BEHIND HER AND FOUND HERSELF RECONNOITERED BY FITZPIERS HIMSELF APPROACHING GAY AND FRESH AS THE MORNING AROUND THEM
4492-8904-0030 HIS REMOTE GAZE AT HER HAD BEEN ONE OF MILD INTEREST RATHER THAN OF RAPTURE BUT SHE LOOKED SO LOVELY IN THE GREEN WORLD ABOUT HER HER PINK CHEEKS HER SIMPLE LIGHT DRESS
4492-8904-0031 AND THE DELICATE FLEXIBILITY OF HER MOVEMENT ACQUIRED SUCH RARITY FROM THEIR WILD WOOD SETTING THAT HIS EYES KINDLED AS HE DREW NEAR MY DARLING WHAT IS IT YOUR FATHER SAYS YOU ARE IN THE POUTS AND JEALOUS
4492-8904-0032 AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HA HA HA
4492-8904-0033 WE KNOW BETTER JEALOUS OH NO
4492-8904-0034 THAT'S A MISTAKE OF HIS AND YOURS SIR I SPOKE TO HIM SO CLOSELY ABOUT THE QUESTION OF MARRIAGE WITH YOU THAT HE DID NOT APPREHEND MY STATE OF MIND
4492-8904-0035 SHE SHRANK AWAY AND HIS PURPOSED KISS MISCARRIED WHAT IS IT HE SAID MORE SERIOUSLY FOR THIS LITTLE DEFEAT SHE MADE NO ANSWER BEYOND MISTER FITZPIERS I HAVE HAD NO BREAKFAST I MUST GO IN
4492-8904-0036 COME HE INSISTED FIXING HIS EYES UPON HER TELL ME AT ONCE I SAY IT WAS THE GREATER STRENGTH AGAINST THE SMALLER BUT SHE WAS MASTERED LESS BY HIS MANNER THAN BY HER OWN SENSE OF THE UNFAIRNESS OF SILENCE
4492-8904-0037 SHE SAID WITH HESITATION I'LL TELL YOU BY AND BY I MUST GO IN DOORS I HAVE HAD NO BREAKFAST BY A SORT OF DIVINATION HIS CONJECTURE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FACT NOR I SAID HE LIGHTLY
4492-8904-0038 INDEED I ROSE LATE TO DAY I HAVE HAD A BROKEN NIGHT OR RATHER MORNING
4492-8904-0039 PERFECTLY MADDENED WITH AN ACHING TOOTH AS NO BODY HEARD HER RING SHE THREW SOME GRAVEL AT MY WINDOW TILL AT LAST I HEARD HER AND SLIPPED ON MY DRESSING GOWN AND WENT DOWN THE POOR THING BEGGED ME WITH TEARS IN HER EYES TO TAKE OUT HER TORMENTOR
4492-8904-0040 IF I DRAGGED HER HEAD OFF DOWN SHE SAT AND OUT IT CAME A LOVELY MOLAR NOT A SPECK UPON IT AND OFF SHE WENT WITH IT IN HER HANDKERCHIEF
4492-8904-0041 IT WAS ALL SO PLAUSIBLE SO COMPLETELY EXPLAINED KNOWING NOTHING OF THE INCIDENT IN THE WOOD ON OLD MIDSUMMER EVE GRACE FELT THAT HER SUSPICIONS WERE UNWORTHY AND ABSURD AND WITH THE READINESS OF AN HONEST HEART
4492-8904-0042 SHE JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY OF HONORING HIS WORD AT THE MOMENT OF HER MENTAL LIBERATION THE BUSHES ABOUT THE GARDEN HAD MOVED AND HER FATHER EMERGED INTO THE SHADY GLADE WELL I HOPE IT IS MADE UP HE SAID CHEERILY
4492-8904-0043 OH YES SAID FITZPIERS WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON GRACE WHOSE EYES WERE SHYLY BENT DOWNWARD NOW SAID HER FATHER TELL ME THE PAIR OF YE
4492-8904-0044 FITZPIERS TOOK HER HAND WE DECLARE IT DO WE NOT MY DEAR GRACE SAID HE RELIEVED OF HER DOUBT SOMEWHAT OVERAWED AND EVER ANXIOUS TO PLEASE SHE WAS DISPOSED TO SETTLE THE MATTER YET WOMANLIKE
4492-8904-0045 SHE WOULD NOT RELINQUISH HER OPPORTUNITY
4492-8904-0046 IF OUR WEDDING CAN BE AT CHURCH I SAY YES SHE ANSWERED IN A MEASURED VOICE IF NOT I SAY NO FITZPIERS WAS GENEROUS IN HIS TURN IT SHALL BE SO HE REJOINED GRACEFULLY
4492-8904-0047 TO HOLY CHURCH WE'LL GO AND MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO US THEY RETURNED THROUGH THE BUSHES INDOORS GRACE WALKING FULL OF THOUGHT BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO SOMEWHAT COMFORTED BOTH BY FITZPIERS'S INGENIOUS EXPLANATION AND BY THE SENSE THAT SHE WAS NOT
4492-8904-0048 TO BE DEPRIVED OF A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY
4492-8904-0049 PRAY GOD IT IS FOR THE BEST FROM THIS HOUR THERE WAS NO SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT RECALCITRATION ON HER PART FITZPIERS KEPT HIMSELF CONTINUALLY NEAR HER DOMINATING ANY REBELLIOUS IMPULSE
4492-8904-0050 AND SHAPING HER WILL INTO PASSIVE CONCURRENCE WITH ALL HIS DESIRES APART FROM HIS LOVER LIKE ANXIETY TO POSSESS HER THE FEW GOLDEN HUNDREDS OF THE TIMBER DEALER READY TO HAND FORMED A WARM BACKGROUND TO GRACE'S LOVELY FACE
4492-8904-0051 AND WENT SOME WAY TO REMOVE HIS UNEASINESS AT THE PROSPECT OF ENDANGERING HIS PROFESSIONAL AND SOCIAL CHANCES BY AN ALLIANCE WITH THE FAMILY OF A SIMPLE COUNTRYMAN THE INTERIM CLOSED UP ITS PERSPECTIVE
4492-8904-0052 SURELY AND SILENTLY WHENEVER GRACE HAD ANY DOUBTS OF HER POSITION THE SENSE OF CONTRACTING TIME WAS LIKE A SHORTENING CHAMBER AT OTHER MOMENTS SHE WAS COMPARATIVELY BLITHE DAY AFTER DAY WAXED AND WANED
4492-8904-0053 THE ONE OR TWO WOODMEN WHO SAWED SHAPED SPOKESHAVED ON HER FATHER'S PREMISES AT THIS INACTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR REGULARLY CAME AND UNLOCKED THE DOORS IN THE MORNING LOCKED THEM IN THE EVENING SUPPED
4492-8904-0054 LEANED OVER THEIR GARDEN GATES FOR A WHIFF OF EVENING AIR AND TO CATCH ANY LAST AND FARTHEST THROB OF NEWS FROM THE OUTER WORLD WHICH ENTERED AND EXPIRED AT LITTLE HINTOCK LIKE THE EXHAUSTED SWELL OF A WAVE IN SOME INNERMOST CAVERN
4492-8904-0055 OF SOME INNERMOST CREEK OF AN EMBAYED SEA YET NO NEWS INTERFERED WITH THE NUPTIAL PURPOSE AT THEIR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE THE SAPPY GREEN TWIG TIPS OF THE SEASON'S GROWTH WOULD NOT SHE THOUGHT BE APPRECIABLY WOODIER
4492-8904-0056 ON THE DAY SHE BECAME A WIFE SO NEAR WAS THE TIME THE TINTS OF THE FOLIAGE WOULD HARDLY HAVE CHANGED EVERYTHING WAS SO MUCH AS USUAL THAT NO ITINERANT STRANGER WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED A WOMAN'S FATE TO BE HANGING IN THE BALANCE AT THAT SUMMER'S DECLINE
4492-8904-0057 BUT THERE WERE PREPARATIONS IMAGINABLE READILY ENOUGH BY THOSE WHO HAD SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE REMOTE AND FASHIONABLE TOWN OF SANDBOURNE SOMETHING WAS GROWING UP UNDER THE HANDS OF SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN GRACE MELBURY
4492-8904-0058 NEVER WOULD SEE HER OR CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HER AT ALL THOUGH THEIR CREATION HAD SUCH INTERESTING RELATION TO HER LIFE THAT IT WOULD ENCLOSE HER VERY HEART AT A MOMENT WHEN THAT HEART WOULD BEAT IF NOT WITH MORE EMOTIONAL ARDOR
4492-8904-0059 AT LEAST WITH MORE EMOTIONAL TURBULENCE THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS TIME WHY DID MISSUS DOLLERY'S VAN INSTEAD OF PASSING ALONG AT THE END OF THE SMALLER VILLAGE TO GREAT HINTOCK DIRECT TURN ONE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO LITTLE HINTOCK LANE
4492-8904-0060 AND NEVER PULL UP TILL IT REACHED MISTER MELBURY'S GATES THE GILDING SHINE OF EVENING FELL UPON A LARGE FLAT BOX NOT LESS THAN A YARD SQUARE AND SAFELY TIED WITH CORD AS IT WAS HANDED OUT FROM UNDER THE TILT
4492-8904-0061 WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CARE BUT IT WAS NOT HEAVY FOR ITS SIZE MISSUS DOLLERY HERSELF CARRIED IT INTO THE HOUSE
4492-8904-0062 AND MADE REMARKS TO EACH OTHER AS THEY WATCHED ITS ENTRANCE MELBURY STOOD AT THE DOOR OF THE TIMBER SHED IN THE ATTITUDE OF A MAN TO WHOM SUCH AN ARRIVAL WAS A TRIFLING DOMESTIC DETAIL WITH WHICH HE DID NOT CONDESCEND TO BE CONCERNED
4492-8904-0063 YET HE WELL DIVINED THE CONTENTS OF THAT BOX AND WAS IN TRUTH ALL THE WHILE IN A PLEASANT EXALTATION AT THE PROOF THAT THUS FAR AT ANY RATE NO DISAPPOINTMENT HAD SUPERVENED
4492-8904-0064 BEEN PAID AND HAD RUMBLED AWAY HE ENTERED THE DWELLING
4492-8904-0065 HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER IN A FLUTTER OF EXCITEMENT OVER THE WEDDING GOWN JUST ARRIVED FROM THE LEADING DRESS MAKER OF SANDBOURNE WATERING PLACE AFORESAID DURING THESE WEEKS GILES WINTERBORNE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN OR HEARD OF
4492-8904-0066 AT THE CLOSE OF HIS TENURE IN HINTOCK HE HAD SOLD SOME OF HIS FURNITURE
4492-8904-0067 IN THE HOUSE OF A FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR AND GONE AWAY PEOPLE SAID THAT A CERTAIN LAXITY HAD CREPT INTO HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD NEVER GONE NEAR A CHURCH LATTERLY AND HAD BEEN SOMETIMES SEEN ON SUNDAYS WITH UNBLACKED BOOTS LYING ON HIS ELBOW UNDER A TREE
4492-8904-0068 WITH A CYNICAL GAZE AT SURROUNDING OBJECTS HE WAS LIKELY TO RETURN TO HINTOCK WHEN THE CIDER MAKING SEASON CAME ROUND HIS APPARATUS BEING STORED THERE AND TRAVEL WITH HIS MILL AND PRESS FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE
4492-8904-0069 THE NARROW INTERVAL THAT STOOD BEFORE THE DAY DIMINISHED YET THERE WAS IN GRACE'S MIND SOMETIMES A CERTAIN ANTICIPATIVE SATISFACTION THE SATISFACTION OF FEELING THAT SHE WOULD BE THE HEROINE OF AN HOUR
4492-8904-0070 MOREOVER SHE WAS PROUD AS A CULTIVATED WOMAN TO BE THE WIFE OF A CULTIVATED MAN IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY DENIED VERY FREQUENTLY TO YOUNG WOMEN IN HER POSITION NOWADAYS NOT A FEW
4492-8904-0071 THOSE IN WHOM PARENTAL DISCOVERY OF THE VALUE OF EDUCATION HAS IMPLANTED TASTES WHICH PARENTAL CIRCLES FAIL TO GRATIFY BUT WHAT AN ATTENUATION WAS THIS COLD PRIDE OF THE DREAM OF HER YOUTH
4492-8904-0072 IN WHICH SHE HAD PICTURED HERSELF WALKING IN STATE TOWARDS THE ALTAR FLUSHED BY THE PURPLE LIGHT AND BLOOM OF HER OWN PASSION WITHOUT A SINGLE MISGIVING AS TO THE SEALING OF THE BOND AND FERVENTLY RECEIVING AS HER DUE
4492-8904-0073 THE HOMAGE OF A THOUSAND HEARTS THE FOND DEEP LOVE OF ONE EVERYTHING HAD BEEN CLEAR THEN IN IMAGINATION NOW SOMETHING WAS UNDEFINED SHE HAD LITTLE CARKING ANXIETIES A CURIOUS FATEFULNESS SEEMED TO RULE HER
4492-8904-0074 AND SHE EXPERIENCED A MOURNFUL WANT OF SOME ONE TO CONFIDE IN THE DAY LOOMED SO BIG AND NIGH THAT HER PROPHETIC EAR COULD IN FANCY CATCH THE NOISE OF IT HEAR THE MURMUR OF THE VILLAGERS AS SHE CAME OUT OF CHURCH
4492-8904-0075 IMAGINE THE JANGLE OF THE THREE THIN TONED HINTOCK BELLS THE DIALOGUES SEEMED TO GROW LOUDER AND THE DING DING DONG OF THOSE THREE CRAZED BELLS MORE PERSISTENT SHE AWOKE THE MORNING HAD COME
