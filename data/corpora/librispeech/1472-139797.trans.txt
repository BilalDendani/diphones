1472-139797-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN A WORLD OF HIGH MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE I SPENT A LONG AND PROFITABLE SEASON IN THE VICINITY OF THE GREAT DIPPER WITNESSING THE ALMOST INFINITE VARIATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE AS FOUND FROM WORLD TO WORLD AND LOOKING UPON THE WILD WASTES OF THE MANY PLANETS THAT ARE NOT INHABITED
1472-139797-0001 FINALLY I AGAIN SPREAD MY SWIFT WINGS REACHED THE BEAUTIFUL STAR ARCTURUS AND NOTICED AMONG THE WORLDS THAT REVOLVE AROUND IT A FEW THAT ARE SINLESS I WAS TEMPTED TO PAUSE AT ONE OR ANOTHER OF THESE EXCEPTIONAL STATIONS BUT I KNEW THAT I COULD NOT TARRY UNTIL I HAD REACHED THE FAR DISTANT CONSTELLATION OF SCORPIO
1472-139797-0002 IN THIS WIDE FLIGHT I TRAVELED A DISTANCE SO GREAT THAT I WILL NOT WEARY THE MIND WITH MENTIONING THE TRILLIONS OF MILES NOW I WAS IN THE DIRECT PATH OF THE MILKY WAY AND MY IMAGINATION STAGGERED AS I SAW THE ENDLESSNESS OF STARS AND SOLAR SYSTEMS
1472-139797-0003 AS FAR OUT BEYOND ME AS MY ASSISTED EYES COULD REACH THE STAR AT WHICH I ARRIVED IS ONE OF THE LARGEST SUNS THAT BLAZE IN THE DEPTHS OF IMMENSITY IT IS SO WONDERFULLY GREAT THAT IF TWELVE HUNDRED MILLION WORLDS AS LARGE AS OURS WERE ALL CRUSHED INTO ONE GREAT BALL
1472-139797-0004 IT WOULD NOT MAKE ONE SPHERE AS IMMENSE AS THIS STAR OR SUN AROUND WHICH REVOLVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED WORLDS OR PLANETS MANY OF WHICH ARE GREATER THAN OUR JUPITER WITH ABOUNDING INTEREST I VISITED ALL THE INHABITED WORLDS OF THIS VAST SYSTEM HOW LONG IT TOOK I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING
1472-139797-0005 SOME OF THESE WORLDS SUSTAIN A LOW ORDER OF HUMAN CREATURES WHILE ON OTHERS THERE ARE RACES THAT HAVE REACHED A HIGH DEGREE IN THE SCALE OF ADVANCEMENT OF THESE FIVE HUNDRED WORLDS NEARLY ONE HALF ARE BARREN OF ALL LIFE AND OF THOSE THAT ARE INHABITED SOME TWENTY ARE SINLESS WORLDS
1472-139797-0006 A PERIOD TOWARD WHICH WE ARE ANXIOUSLY LOOKING AND WHICH WE DESIGNATE AS THE MILLENNIUM OF ALL THIS PONDEROUS SOLAR SYSTEM THERE IS ONE WORLD THAT EXCELS ALL THE OTHERS IN ITS MEDICAL ATTAINMENTS AND OF THIS ONE FIRST I WILL GIVE A FLYING NOTICE
1472-139797-0007 I HAVE NAMED THIS WORLD DORE LYN IT IS FIFTY TIMES AS LARGE AS OUR EARTH AND OF GREATER SPECIFIC GRAVITY ITS HUMAN CREATURES ARE DELIGHTFULLY FORMED AND ARE IN RUDDY HEALTH AND REFINED HAPPINESS IN SHAPE THESE DORE LYNITES DIFFER SOMEWHAT FROM US
1472-139797-0008 AND ASCERTAINED THAT CREATURES COULD BE BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT RESEMBLING US WHATEVER HERE I FOUND FOUR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND THERE IS ROOM FOR TWENTY BILLIONS MORE SO IF YOU ARE IN ILL HEALTH AND HAVE RUN THE ROUND OF OUR MEDICAL FRATERNITY WITHOUT SUCCESS I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO GO TO DORE LYN
1472-139797-0009 IF YOU KNOW HOW TO REACH IT THESE DORE LYNITES ARE ALMOST THREE TIMES OUR SIZE AND THEY ARE SUBJECT TO MOST OF OUR ILLS AND MANY MORE FROM AN EARLY DATE THE HEAD GOVERNMENT OF THIS WORLD PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO HYGIENE KEEPING ALL MEDICAL WORK UNDER ITS OWN CARE
1472-139797-0010 THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS THE WHOLE FIELD OF MEDICAL SCIENCE JUST AS WE DO THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT THERE ARE NO CONFLICTING SCHOOLS OF MEDICINES SUCH AS ALLOPATHIC HOMEOPATHIC HYDROPATHIC ECLECTIC AND OSTEOPATHIC
1472-139797-0011 THAT NO PHYSICIAN OR MEDICAL SCHOOL WOULD THINK OF HAVING IN OUR WORLD THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOLS OF DORE LYN ARE MARVELS INDEED NOTHING IS SPARED THAT MONEY OR TALENT CAN FURNISH THE FULL GRADUATES OF THESE SCHOOLS ARE ONLY THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
1472-139797-0012 THE GOVERNMENT HAS A SERIES OF INSTITUTIONS THAT DO A WORK SIMILAR TO OUR HOSPITALS AND HAVE A CORPS OF FULL GRADUATES SUPPLYING THE STATIONS THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM IS SO ARRANGED THAT EVERY FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES ALL NECESSARY TREATMENT FREE
1472-139797-0013 THE COST OF CARRYING ON THIS VAST SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE ITEMS OF NATIONAL EXPENSE I WILL NOW MENTION SOME OF THE MEDICAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THESE DORE LYNITES WHEN A PHYSICIAN SUSPECTS THAT THE BLOOD IS POISONED HE AT ONCE PROCEEDS TO A CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
1472-139797-0014 AND IF CERTAIN KINDS OF POISON ARE FOUND THE BLOOD IS FILTERED BY THE USE OF A FINE INSTRUMENT A BLOOD VESSEL IS EXPOSED AND CUT AND THE TWO ENDS FASTENED TO THE DELICATE FILTER THUS THE BLOOD IS CLEANSED BY PASSING THROUGH THIS INSTRUMENT
1472-139797-0015 THOSE ACQUAINTED WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE BLOOD CIRCULATES CAN READILY SEE HOW ALL THE BLOOD OF THE BODY CAN BE REACHED IN A SHORT TIME
1472-139797-0016 AND ALL TYPES OF HYDROPHOBIA WHICH ARE TEN FOLD MORE NUMEROUS IN DORE LYN THAN IN OUR WORLD THERE ARE NO PATENT MEDICINES IN DORE LYN THE FEW MEDICINES THEY HAVE ARE MANUFACTURED ONLY BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY
1472-139797-0017 NO DISTINCTION BEING MADE BETWEEN RICH AND POOR ONE THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF DORE LYN WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH ARE SEEN IN OUR WORLD TO DAY PEOPLE WERE COMPELLED TO TAKE ALL MANNER OF POISONS AND OPIATES EVEN FROM SKILLED HANDS
1472-139797-0018 BUT IN DORE LYN THOSE DAYS OF DARKNESS AND MISERY ARE PAST AND THE PEOPLE ENJOY THE BENEFIT OF A MEDICAL SKILL ONE THOUSAND YEARS AHEAD OF US THEY LOOK BACK TO THE PRACTICE OF THE OLD PHYSICIANS WITH LUDICROUS FEELINGS
1472-139797-0019 JUST AS WE DO WHEN READING THE PRESCRIPTIONS THAT WERE USED IN THE FIRST CENTURY OF OUR DISPENSATION WE CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE ANTIQUATED REMEDIES OF OUR WORLD AS RELATED BY GEIKE AND COPIED FROM A MEDICAL JOURNAL OF OUR OWN COUNTRY FOLLOWING IS A LIST
1472-139797-0020 ASHES OF WOLF'S SKULL STAG'S HORN THE HEADS OF MICE THE EYES OF CRABS OWL'S BRAINS LIVER OF FROGS VIPER'S FAT GRASSHOPPERS BATS ET CETERA
1472-139797-0021 THESE SUPPLIED THE ALKALIS WHICH WERE PRESCRIBED PHYSICIANS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO ORDER DOSES OF THE GALL OF WILD SWINE IT IS PRESUMED THE TAME HOG WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY EFFICACIOUS
1472-139797-0022 MICE EXCRETION MADE INTO A PLASTER AND OTHER EQUALLY VILE AND UNSAVORY COMPOUNDS COLDS IN THE HEAD WERE CURED BY KISSING THE NOSE OF A MULE FOR SORE THROAT SNAIL SLIME WAS A FAVORITE PRESCRIPTION
1472-139797-0023 AND MOUSE FLESH WAS CONSIDERED EXCELLENT FOR DISEASE OF THE LUNGS BOILED SNAILS AND POWDERED BATS WERE PRESCRIBED FOR INTESTINAL DISORDERS WHEN WE READ SUCH A LIST OF REMEDIES WE CAN SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE EVER POPULAR
1472-139797-0024 BUT ACCORDING TO THE HISTORY OF DORE LYN THE TIME WILL COME WHEN MANY OF OUR PRESENT MEDICINES WILL BE OUT OF DATE AND ONLY MENTIONED IN THE OLD MEDICAL WORKS THE PEOPLE OF DORE LYN HAVE SUFFERED IN PAST AGES INNUMERABLE WOES ON ACCOUNT OF INTEMPERANCE ALCOHOL IS UNKNOWN TO THEM
1472-139797-0025 BUT THEY HAVE HAD A TWO THOUSAND YEAR'S BATTLE AGAINST THREE LIQUIDS THAT AFFECT THEM AS OPIUM AFFECTS US STRANGE TO SAY THAT THESE TERRIBLE LIQUIDS WERE THE BASES OF MANY OF THEIR MEDICINES JUST LIKE THE ANODYNE MEDICINES OF OUR PRESENT DAY
1472-139797-0026 THUS IN DORE LYN THE OLD KINDS OF MEDICINES CREATED MANY DRUNKARDS SINCE THE DAWN OF THE BRIGHTER AGE A STRICT LAW PREVAILS REGARDING THE USE OF ALL NARCOTICS IN MEDICINES THEN CAME GRADUALLY INTO USE THE MANY METHODS OF TREATING DISEASE WITHOUT MEDICINE
1472-139797-0027 EXCEPT THE MATERIALS USED TO SUSTAIN LIFE REGULARLY BEING INTERESTED IN THESE THINGS I EXAMINED MORE CLOSELY INTO THEIR PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND SAW MORE CLEARLY THE PRESENT FOLLY OF A CERTAIN PART OF OUR MEDICINAL PRACTICE HOW WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH ALCOHOL
1472-139797-0028 ESPECIALLY AS FOUND IN SO MANY OF OUR PATENT MEDICINES AND HOW HELPLESS WE ARE IN TRYING TO ABOLISH THE SALE OF THESE MEDICINES BY REASON OF OUR UNBOUNDED LIBERTY IN OUR WORLD A MAN MAY CONCOCT ANY ALCOHOLIC MEDICINE AND SELL IT WITHOUT LIQUOR LICENSE
1472-139797-0029 FOR PEOPLE BECOME VERILY MAD FOR THE BOTTLED STUFF OUR NATION MAY SOME DAY BECOME WISE ENOUGH TO KEEP ITS OWN HAND ON THE BUSINESS THAT IS DETERMINING THE HEALTH AND HAPPINESS OF MILLIONS OF ITS INHABITANTS BUT LET ME CEASE THIS DIGRESSION AND GET BACK ONCE MORE TO DORE LYN
1472-139797-0030 ONE OF THE MOST NOTED MEDICAL ACHIEVEMENTS ON THIS WORLD CONSISTS IN THE MANNER OF RENDERING A PERSON UNCONSCIOUS OF PAIN THE ANATOMY OF A DORE LYNITE IS IN GENERAL THE SAME AS OUR ANATOMY THEIR BONES ARE ARRANGED A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY
1472-139797-0031 AND THE SECTIONS OF THE BACKBONE HAVE A QUITE DIFFERENT FORMATION WHEN A SURGEON OF THAT WORLD WISHES TO PERFORM AN OPERATION AND THEREFORE RENDER THE PATIENT UNCONSCIOUS HE PRESSES THE TOUGH CARTILAGENOUS PART OF A SECTION OF THE BACKBONE WITH A SCREW DEVICE FASTENED TO THE BODY OF THE PATIENT
1472-139797-0032 THIS SIMPLE ACT RENDERS THE SPINAL CORD INSENSITIVE WHICH CONDITION MAY BE MAINTAINED FOR HOURS WITHOUT INJURING THE PATIENT OF COURSE ANY POINT ABOVE THE SCREW DEVICE IS SENSITIVE AND FOR THIS REASON IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO RENDER A PERSON UNCONSCIOUS IN THE PARTS ABOUT THE HEAD
1472-139797-0033 MANY AGES AGO THE WORLD OF MICROBES WAS LAID BARE BUT NOT BEFORE THESE PEOPLE WERE MASTERS OF THE MICROSCOPE OR AN INSTRUMENT SERVING THE SAME PURPOSES ALTHOUGH FORMED ON A PARTLY DIFFERENT PRINCIPLE
1472-139797-0034 THESE DORE LYNITES HAVE BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE NUMEROUS VARIETIES OF PARASITE BROODS THAT CAUSE FERMENTATIONS AND DISEASES BOTH INFECTIOUS AND OTHERWISE A DISEASED BODY IS LOOKED UPON AS BEING IN POSSESSION OF A CERTAIN BROOD OF MICROBES WHICH ARE DESTROYED EITHER BY THE BLOOD FILTER
1472-139797-0035 THIS IS MERELY A HYGIENIC SELECTION OF FOODS GIVEN TO PEOPLE OF DECLINING HEALTH INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM SWALLOW TEN OR TWENTY DOLLARS WORTH OF STRONG MEDICINES ABNORMAL APPETITES CRAVE FOR A CLASS OF FOODS INJURIOUS TO THE SYSTEM
1472-139797-0036 IN DORE LYN THEY HAVE DISCOVERED A NOVEL METHOD OF TURNING THE DISEASED APPETITE FROM ITS CRAVINGS TOWARD THE THINGS NEEDED BY THE SYSTEM IN PERFORMING OPERATIONS THE EXPERTS OF DORE LYN HAVE REACHED A MARVELOUS DEGREE OF PERFECTION
1472-139797-0037 IT TOOK THREE AND ONE HALF THOUSAND YEARS OF CONTINUAL EXPERIMENTING ON THIS DELICATE CREATION BEFORE IT WAS PRONOUNCED SATISFACTORY THE FALSE EYE IS NOT OF FLESH BUT ONE OF MANUFACTURE IT IS PLACED IN SENSITIVE CONNECTION WITH THE OPTIC NERVE
1472-139797-0038 ON WHICH IMAGES ARE THROWN BY THE DELICATE MECHANISM OF THE FALSE EYE THE SIGHT THUS OBTAINED IS ALMOST ONE HALF AS DISTINCT AS THAT WHICH IS ENJOYED BY THE NORMAL EYE THESE MEDICAL WIZARDS ALSO MAKE ARTIFICIAL EARS WHICH ARE ABOUT AS SATISFACTORY AS THE NATURAL EARS
1472-139797-0039 IN CERTAIN LINES OF SURGERY WE ARE EQUAL TO THESE DORE LYNITES BUT WE CANNOT REGISTER WITH THEM IN THE WHOLE CATEGORY OF SURGICAL ACHIEVEMENTS THEY HAVE SIMPLY DISTANCED US BY FIVE HUNDRED YEARS THAT IS I BELIEVE THAT IN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS WE CAN REACH THE FIELDS OF GLORY WHICH THEY NOW OCCUPY
1472-139797-0040 THINK OF LAYING BARE A HUMAN LUNG AND TREATING IT WITH A SPECIAL PREPARATION FOR EXTREME CASES OF LUNG DISEASES AND ALSO TREATING IT WITH A BAKING FOR DEPARTMENT CASES OF A DISEASE SIMILAR TO PNEUMONIA PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL CLASS OF OPERATIONS IS PERFORMED ON THE HEART AND THE BRAIN
1472-139797-0041 THE HEART IS LAID BARE UNDER A SHEET OF THERMAL RAYS FATTY TISSUES ARE REMOVED AND OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS ERADICATED DURING THE REGULAR HEART BEATS THE GOVERNMENT GRANTS CERTAIN PRIVILEGES OF EXPERIMENTING ON HER LOWEST CLASS OF CRIMINALS
1472-139797-0042 THAT THEY HAVE NO POWER OF RECALLING THEIR PAST LIFE AND ARE INCAPABLE OF UTTERING AN OATH
