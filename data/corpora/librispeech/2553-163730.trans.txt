2553-163730-0000 HOW TO GET OUT OF CHANCERY THINGS AT THIS TIME SO BEFELL ME THAT I CANNOT TELL ONE HALF BUT AM LIKE A BOY WHO HAS LEFT HIS LESSON TO THE MASTER'S VERY FOOTFALL UNREADY
2553-163730-0001 EXCEPT WITH FALSE EXCUSES AND AS THIS MAKES NO GOOD WORK SO I LAMENT UPON MY LINGERING IN THE TIMES WHEN I MIGHT HAVE GOT THROUGH A GOOD PAGE BUT WENT ASTRAY AFTER TRIFLES HOWEVER
2553-163730-0002 EVERY MAN MUST DO ACCORDING TO HIS INTELLECT AND LOOKING AT THE EASY MANNER OF MY CONSTITUTION I THINK THAT MOST MEN WILL REGARD ME WITH PITY AND GOODWILL FOR TRYING MORE THAN WITH CONTEMPT AND WRATH FOR HAVING TRIED UNWORTHILY
2553-163730-0003 EVEN AS IN THE WRESTLING RING WHATEVER MAN DID HIS BEST AND MADE AN HONEST CONFLICT I ALWAYS LAID HIM DOWN WITH SOFTNESS EASING OFF HIS DUSTY FALL BUT THE THING WHICH NEXT BETIDED ME
2553-163730-0004 IN WONDERFUL HEALTH AND SPIRITS AND AS GLAD AS A BIRD TO GET BACK AGAIN IT WOULD HAVE DONE ANY ONE GOOD FOR A TWELVE MONTH TO BEHOLD HER FACE AND DOINGS AND HER BEAMING EYES AND SMILE
2553-163730-0005 ALL THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF BRIGHTNESS AS IF THE SUN HAD COME OVER THE HILL AND LORNA WERE HIS MIRROR
2553-163730-0006 AND LOOKED AT HER AND EVEN LIZZIE'S EYES MUST DANCE TO THE FRESHNESS AND JOY OF HER BEAUTY AS FOR ME YOU MIGHT CALL ME MAD
2553-163730-0007 AND KISSED MOTHER FRY TILL SHE MADE AT ME WITH THE SUGAR NIPPERS WHAT A QUANTITY OF THINGS LORNA HAD TO TELL US AND YET HOW OFTEN WE STOPPED HER MOUTH AT LEAST MOTHER I MEAN AND LIZZIE
2553-163730-0008 AND SHE QUITE AS OFTEN WOULD STOP HER OWN RUNNING UP IN HER JOY TO SOME ONE OF US AND THEN THERE AROSE THE EATING BUSINESS WHICH PEOPLE NOW CALL REFRESHMENT
2553-163730-0009 DAYS OF OUR LANGUAGE FOR HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT OUR LORNA COULD HAVE COME ALL THAT WAY
2553-163730-0010 WITHOUT BEING TERRIBLY HUNGRY OH I DO LOVE IT ALL SO MUCH SAID LORNA NOW FOR THE FIFTIETH TIME AND NOT MEANING ONLY THE VICTUALS THE SCENT OF THE
2553-163730-0011 GORSE ON THE MOORS DROVE ME WILD AND THE PRIMROSES UNDER THE HEDGES I AM SURE I WAS MEANT FOR A FARMER'S I MEAN FOR A FARM HOUSE LIFE DEAR LIZZIE' FOR LIZZIE WAS LOOKING SAUCILY
2553-163730-0012 AND FOR WRITING DESPATCHES OF VICTORY AND NOW
2553-163730-0013 BUT MY RESOLUTION FAILS ME I AM MY OWN MISTRESS WHAT THINK YOU OF THAT MOTHER I AM MY OWN MISTRESS THEN YOU SHALL NOT BE SO LONG CRIED I
2553-163730-0014 AND BEYOND DOUBT A TRUE ONE BUT SURELY UNUSUAL AT THIS STAGE AND A LITTLE PREMATURE JOHN HOWEVER WHAT MUST BE MUST BE AND WITH TEARS SPRINGING OUT OF SMILES
2553-163730-0015 SHE FELL ON MY BREAST AND CRIED A BIT WHEN I CAME TO SMOKE A PIPE OVER IT AFTER THE REST WERE GONE TO BED I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IN MY GOOD LUCK FOR HERE WAS I WITHOUT ANY MERIT EXCEPT OF BODILY POWER
2553-163730-0016 WHICH SURELY IS NO COMMENDATION SO PLACED THAT THE NOBLEST MAN IN ENGLAND MIGHT ENVY ME AND BE VEXED WITH ME FOR THE NOBLEST LADY IN ALL THE LAND AND THE PUREST AND THE SWEETEST HUNG UPON MY HEART
2553-163730-0017 AS IF THERE WAS NONE TO EQUAL IT I DWELLED UPON THIS MATTER LONG AND VERY SEVERELY WHILE I SMOKED A NEW TOBACCO BROUGHT BY MY OWN LORNA FOR ME AND NEXT TO HERSELF MOST DELICIOUS
2553-163730-0018 THE SMOKE CURLED AWAY I THOUGHT SURELY THIS IS TOO FINE TO LAST FOR A MAN WHO NEVER DESERVED IT SEEING NO WAY OUT OF THIS I RESOLVED TO PLACE MY FAITH IN GOD
2553-163730-0019 HAVING LORNA UNDER IT IN THE MORNING LORNA WAS READY TO TELL HER STORY AND WE TO
2553-163730-0020 AND SHE WORE A DRESS OF MOST SIMPLE STUFF AND YET PERFECTLY WONDERFUL BY MEANS OF THE SHAPE AND HER FIGURE LIZZIE WAS WILD WITH JEALOUSY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED THOUGH NEVER WOULD ANNIE HAVE BEEN SO
2553-163730-0021 AND WAS NEVER QUITE BRISK UNLESS THE QUESTION WERE ABOUT MYSELF SHE HAD SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE AND GRIEF BEGINS TO CLOSE ON PEOPLE AS THEIR POWER OF LIFE DECLINES
2553-163730-0022 WE SAID THAT SHE WAS HARD OF HEARING BUT MY OPINION WAS THAT SEEING ME INCLINED FOR MARRIAGE MADE HER THINK OF MY FATHER AND SO PERHAPS A LITTLE TOO MUCH
2553-163730-0023 ANYHOW SHE WAS THE VERY BEST OF MOTHERS AND WOULD SMILE AND COMMAND HERSELF AND BE OR TRY TO BELIEVE HERSELF AS HAPPY AS COULD BE IN THE DOINGS OF THE YOUNGER FOLK
2553-163730-0024 AND HER OWN SKILL IN DETECTING THEM YET WITH THE WISDOM OF AGE RENOUNCING ANY OPINION UPON THE MATTER
2553-163730-0025 AND HER KNOWLEDGE OF MY HEART WAS NOT TO BE CHECKED BY ANY THOUGHTS OF HAPLY COMING EVIL IN THE MORNING SHE WAS UP EVEN SOONER THAN I WAS AND THROUGH ALL THE CORNERS OF THE HENS REMEMBERING EVERY ONE OF THEM I CAUGHT HER
2553-163730-0026 TO BE LOVED BY A VIRTUOUS
2553-163730-0027 AND TO LOVE HER WITH ALL ONE'S HEART NEITHER WAS MY PRIDE DIMINISHED WHEN I FOUND WHAT SHE HAD DONE ONLY FROM HER LOVE OF ME EARL BRANDIR'S ANCIENT STEWARD
2553-163730-0028 ESPECIALLY AFTER HE HAD SEEN OUR SIMPLE HOUSE AND MANNERS ON THE OTHER HAND LORNA CONSIDERED HIM A WORTHY BUT FOOLISH OLD GENTLEMAN TO WHOM TRUE HAPPINESS MEANT NO MORE THAN MONEY AND HIGH POSITION THESE TWO LAST
2553-163730-0029 AND THE GREATEST MONEY TAKER IN THE KINGDOM NEXT TO THE KING AND QUEEN OF COURSE WHO HAD DUE PRE EMINENCE AND HAD TAUGHT THE MAIDS OF HONOUR WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE JEFFREYS
2553-163730-0030 WITH TRIUMPH AND GREAT GLORY AFTER HANGING EVERY MAN WHO WAS TOO POOR TO HELP IT HE PLEASED HIS GRACIOUS MAJESTY SO PURELY WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THEIR DELIGHTFUL AGONIES THAT THE KING EXCLAIMED
2553-163730-0031 FOR AT THIS TIME EARL BRANDIR DIED BEING TAKEN WITH GOUT IN THE HEART SOON AFTER I LEFT LONDON LORNA WAS VERY SORRY FOR HIM BUT AS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO HEAR ONE TONE OF HER SWEET SILVERY VOICE
2553-163730-0032 NOW THE LADY LORNA DUGAL APPEARED TO LORD CHANCELLOR JEFFREYS SO EXCEEDING WEALTHY A WARD THAT THE LOCK WOULD PAY FOR TURNING THEREFORE HE CAME OF HIS OWN ACCORD TO VISIT HER
2553-163730-0033 AND TO TREAT WITH HER HAVING HEARD FOR THE MAN WAS AS BIG A GOSSIP AS NEVER CARED FOR ANYBODY YET LOVED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT EVERYBODY THAT THIS WEALTHY AND BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN
2553-163730-0034 WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ANY YOUNG LORD HAVING PLEDGED HER FAITH TO THE PLAIN JOHN RIDD THEREUPON OUR LORNA MANAGED SO TO HOLD OUT GOLDEN HOPES TO THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR
2553-163730-0035 THE AMOUNT OF WHICH I WILL NOT MENTION BECAUSE OF HIS KINDNESS TOWARDS ME HE GAVE TO HIS FAIR WARD PERMISSION
2553-163730-0036 AND REGARDING ME AS A GOOD CATHOLIC BEING MOVED MOREOVER BY THE QUEEN WHO DESIRED TO PLEASE LORNA CONSENTED WITHOUT MUCH HESITATION UPON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT LORNA WHEN SHE BECAME OF FULL AGE AND THE MISTRESS OF HER PROPERTY
2553-163730-0037 INASMUCH HOWEVER AS KING JAMES WAS DRIVEN OUT OF HIS KINGDOM BEFORE THIS ARRANGEMENT COULD TAKE EFFECT AND ANOTHER KING SUCCEEDED WHO DESIRED NOT THE PROMOTION OF THE CATHOLIC RELIGION NEITHER HANKERED AFTER SUBSIDIES
2553-163730-0038 AND I REPLIED WITH THE GREATEST WARMTH AND A READINESS TO WORSHIP HER THAT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT I LONGED FOR BUT HAD NEVER DARED TO PROPOSE IT BUT DEAR MOTHER LOOKED MOST EXCEEDING GRAVE AND SAID THAT
2553-163730-0039 AND WHO COULD TELL IN THREE YEARS TIME WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ALL OR ANY OF US WHY PERHAPS HIS FARM WOULD BE FOR SALE AND PERHAPS LADY LORNA'S ESTATES IN SCOTLAND WOULD FETCH ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY IT
2553-163730-0040 AND SO THROW THE TWO FARMS INTO ONE AND SAVE ALL THE TROUBLE ABOUT THE BROOK AS MY POOR FATHER HAD LONGED TO DO MANY AND MANY A TIME BUT NOT HAVING A TITLE COULD NOT DO ALL QUITE AS HE WANTED
2553-163730-0041 JUST SUITED FOR CHANGE OF DIET TO OUR SHEEP AS WELL AS LARGE CATTLE AND BESIDE THIS EVEN WITH ALL ANNIE'S SKILL AND OF COURSE YET MORE NOW SHE WAS GONE THEIR BUTTER WOULD ALWAYS COMMAND IN THE MARKET FROM
2553-163730-0042 AS I HEARTILY HOPED HE MIGHT
