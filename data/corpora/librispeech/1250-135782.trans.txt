1250-135782-0000 IT DENOTED THE ADVANCE OF THE PROCESSION OF MAGISTRATES AND CITIZENS ON ITS WAY TOWARDS THE MEETING HOUSE WHERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH A CUSTOM THUS EARLY ESTABLISHED AND EVER SINCE OBSERVED
1250-135782-0001 THE REVEREND MISTER DIMMESDALE WAS TO DELIVER AN ELECTION SERMON
1250-135782-0002 TURNING A CORNER AND MAKING ITS WAY ACROSS THE MARKET PLACE FIRST CAME THE MUSIC IT COMPRISED A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS PERHAPS IMPERFECTLY ADAPTED TO ONE ANOTHER AND PLAYED WITH NO GREAT SKILL
1250-135782-0003 BUT YET ATTAINING THE GREAT OBJECT FOR WHICH THE HARMONY OF DRUM AND CLARION ADDRESSES ITSELF TO THE MULTITUDE
1250-135782-0004 THAT OF IMPARTING A HIGHER AND MORE HEROIC AIR TO THE SCENE OF LIFE THAT PASSES BEFORE THE EYE LITTLE PEARL AT FIRST CLAPPED HER HANDS BUT THEN LOST FOR AN INSTANT THE RESTLESS AGITATION THAT HAD KEPT HER IN A CONTINUAL EFFERVESCENCE THROUGHOUT THE MORNING SHE GAZED SILENTLY
1250-135782-0005 AND SEEMED TO BE BORNE UPWARD LIKE A FLOATING SEA BIRD ON THE LONG HEAVES AND SWELLS OF SOUND BUT SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HER FORMER MOOD BY THE SHIMMER OF THE SUNSHINE ON THE WEAPONS AND BRIGHT ARMOUR OF THE MILITARY COMPANY WHICH FOLLOWED AFTER THE MUSIC AND FORMED THE HONORARY ESCORT OF THE PROCESSION
1250-135782-0006 THIS BODY OF SOLDIERY WHICH STILL SUSTAINS A CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND MARCHES DOWN FROM PAST AGES WITH AN ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE FAME WAS COMPOSED OF NO MERCENARY MATERIALS
1250-135782-0007 ITS RANKS WERE FILLED WITH GENTLEMEN WHO FELT THE STIRRINGS OF MARTIAL IMPULSE AND SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A KIND OF COLLEGE OF ARMS WHERE AS IN AN ASSOCIATION OF KNIGHTS TEMPLARS
1250-135782-0008 THEY MIGHT LEARN THE SCIENCE AND SO FAR AS PEACEFUL EXERCISE WOULD TEACH THEM THE PRACTICES OF WAR THE HIGH ESTIMATION THEN PLACED UPON THE MILITARY CHARACTER MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE LOFTY PORT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE COMPANY
1250-135782-0009 SOME OF THEM INDEED BY THEIR SERVICES IN THE LOW COUNTRIES AND ON OTHER FIELDS OF EUROPEAN WARFARE HAD FAIRLY WON THEIR TITLE TO ASSUME THE NAME AND POMP OF SOLDIERSHIP THE ENTIRE ARRAY MOREOVER
1250-135782-0010 CLAD IN BURNISHED STEEL AND WITH PLUMAGE NODDING OVER THEIR BRIGHT MORIONS HAD A BRILLIANCY OF EFFECT WHICH NO MODERN DISPLAY CAN ASPIRE TO EQUAL AND YET THE MEN OF CIVIL EMINENCE
1250-135782-0011 WHO CAME IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE MILITARY ESCORT WERE BETTER WORTH A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER'S EYE EVEN IN OUTWARD DEMEANOUR THEY SHOWED A STAMP OF MAJESTY THAT MADE THE WARRIOR'S HAUGHTY STRIDE LOOK VULGAR IF NOT ABSURD
1250-135782-0012 HAD FAR LESS CONSIDERATION THAN NOW BUT THE MASSIVE MATERIALS WHICH PRODUCE STABILITY AND DIGNITY OF CHARACTER A GREAT DEAL MORE THE PEOPLE POSSESSED BY HEREDITARY RIGHT THE QUALITY OF REVERENCE
1250-135782-0013 WHICH IN THEIR DESCENDANTS IF IT SURVIVE AT ALL EXISTS IN SMALLER PROPORTION AND WITH A VASTLY DIMINISHED FORCE IN THE SELECTION AND ESTIMATE OF PUBLIC MEN THE CHANGE MAY BE FOR GOOD OR ILL
1250-135782-0014 AND IS PARTLY PERHAPS FOR BOTH IN THAT OLD DAY THE ENGLISH SETTLER ON THESE RUDE SHORES HAVING LEFT KING NOBLES AND ALL DEGREES OF AWFUL RANK BEHIND
1250-135782-0015 WHILE STILL THE FACULTY AND NECESSITY OF REVERENCE WAS STRONG IN HIM BESTOWED IT ON THE WHITE HAIR AND VENERABLE BROW OF AGE ON LONG TRIED INTEGRITY
1250-135782-0016 ON SOLID WISDOM AND SAD COLOURED EXPERIENCE ON ENDOWMENTS OF THAT GRAVE AND WEIGHTY ORDER WHICH GAVE THE IDEA OF PERMANENCE
1250-135782-0017 AND COMES UNDER THE GENERAL DEFINITION OF RESPECTABILITY THESE PRIMITIVE STATESMEN THEREFORE BRADSTREET ENDICOTT DUDLEY BELLINGHAM AND THEIR COMPEERS
1250-135782-0018 SEEM TO HAVE BEEN NOT OFTEN BRILLIANT BUT DISTINGUISHED BY A PONDEROUS SOBRIETY RATHER THAN ACTIVITY OF INTELLECT THEY HAD FORTITUDE AND SELF RELIANCE
1250-135782-0019 AND IN TIME OF DIFFICULTY OR PERIL STOOD UP FOR THE WELFARE OF THE STATE LIKE A LINE OF CLIFFS AGAINST A TEMPESTUOUS TIDE THE TRAITS OF CHARACTER HERE INDICATED
1250-135782-0020 WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SQUARE CAST OF COUNTENANCE AND LARGE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW COLONIAL MAGISTRATES SO FAR AS A DEMEANOUR OF NATURAL AUTHORITY WAS CONCERNED THE MOTHER COUNTRY NEED NOT HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO SEE
1250-135782-0021 THESE FOREMOST MEN OF AN ACTUAL DEMOCRACY ADOPTED INTO THE HOUSE OF PEERS OR MAKE THE PRIVY COUNCIL OF THE SOVEREIGN
1250-135782-0022 NEXT IN ORDER TO THE MAGISTRATES CAME THE YOUNG AND EMINENTLY DISTINGUISHED DIVINE FROM WHOSE LIPS THE RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE OF THE ANNIVERSARY WAS EXPECTED
1250-135782-0023 HIS WAS THE PROFESSION AT THAT ERA IN WHICH INTELLECTUAL ABILITY DISPLAYED ITSELF FAR MORE THAN IN POLITICAL LIFE FOR LEAVING A HIGHER MOTIVE OUT OF THE QUESTION IT OFFERED
1250-135782-0024 INDUCEMENTS POWERFUL ENOUGH IN THE ALMOST WORSHIPPING RESPECT OF THE COMMUNITY TO WIN THE MOST ASPIRING AMBITION INTO ITS SERVICE EVEN POLITICAL POWER AS IN THE CASE OF INCREASE MATHER WAS WITHIN THE GRASP OF A SUCCESSFUL PRIEST
1250-135782-0025 IT WAS THE OBSERVATION OF THOSE WHO BEHELD HIM NOW THAT NEVER SINCE MISTER DIMMESDALE FIRST SET HIS FOOT ON THE NEW ENGLAND SHORE HAD HE EXHIBITED SUCH ENERGY
1250-135782-0026 THERE WAS NO FEEBLENESS OF STEP AS AT OTHER TIMES HIS FRAME WAS NOT BENT NOR DID HIS HAND REST OMINOUSLY UPON HIS HEART YET IF THE CLERGYMAN WERE RIGHTLY VIEWED HIS STRENGTH SEEMED
1250-135782-0027 NOT OF THE BODY IT MIGHT BE SPIRITUAL AND IMPARTED TO HIM BY ANGELICAL MINISTRATIONS IT MIGHT BE THE EXHILARATION OF THAT POTENT CORDIAL WHICH IS DISTILLED ONLY IN THE FURNACE GLOW OF EARNEST AND
1250-135782-0028 LONG CONTINUED THOUGHT OR PERCHANCE HIS SENSITIVE TEMPERAMENT WAS INVIGORATED BY THE LOUD AND PIERCING MUSIC THAT SWELLED HEAVEN WARD AND UPLIFTED HIM ON ITS ASCENDING WAVE NEVERTHELESS
1250-135782-0029 SO ABSTRACTED WAS HIS LOOK IT MIGHT BE QUESTIONED WHETHER MISTER DIMMESDALE EVEN HEARD THE MUSIC THERE WAS HIS BODY MOVING ONWARD AND WITH AN UNACCUSTOMED FORCE BUT WHERE WAS HIS MIND
1250-135782-0030 FAR AND DEEP IN ITS OWN REGION BUSYING ITSELF WITH PRETERNATURAL ACTIVITY TO MARSHAL A PROCESSION OF STATELY THOUGHTS THAT WERE SOON TO ISSUE THENCE AND SO HE SAW NOTHING
1250-135782-0031 HEARD NOTHING KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS AROUND HIM BUT THE SPIRITUAL ELEMENT TOOK UP THE FEEBLE FRAME AND CARRIED IT ALONG UNCONSCIOUS OF THE BURDEN AND CONVERTING IT TO SPIRIT LIKE ITSELF
1250-135782-0032 POSSESS THIS OCCASIONAL POWER OF MIGHTY EFFORT INTO WHICH THEY THROW THE LIFE OF MANY DAYS AND THEN ARE LIFELESS FOR AS MANY MORE HESTER PRYNNE GAZING STEADFASTLY AT THE CLERGYMAN FELT
1250-135782-0033 A DREARY INFLUENCE COME OVER HER BUT WHEREFORE OR WHENCE SHE KNEW NOT UNLESS THAT HE SEEMED SO REMOTE FROM HER OWN SPHERE
1250-135782-0034 ONE GLANCE OF RECOGNITION SHE HAD IMAGINED MUST NEEDS PASS BETWEEN THEM SHE
1250-135782-0035 AND THE MOSSY TREE TRUNK WHERE SITTING HAND IN HAND THEY HAD MINGLED THEIR SAD AND PASSIONATE TALK WITH THE MELANCHOLY MURMUR OF THE BROOK HOW DEEPLY HAD THEY KNOWN EACH OTHER THEN AND WAS THIS THE MAN
1250-135782-0036 SHE HARDLY KNEW HIM NOW HE MOVING PROUDLY PAST ENVELOPED AS IT WERE IN THE RICH MUSIC WITH THE PROCESSION OF MAJESTIC AND VENERABLE FATHERS HE SO UNATTAINABLE IN HIS WORLDLY POSITION AND STILL MORE SO IN THAT FAR VISTA
1250-135782-0037 OF HIS UNSYMPATHIZING THOUGHTS THROUGH WHICH SHE NOW BEHELD HIM HER SPIRIT SANK WITH THE IDEA THAT ALL MUST HAVE BEEN A DELUSION AND THAT VIVIDLY AS SHE HAD DREAMED IT
1250-135782-0038 THERE COULD BE NO REAL BOND BETWIXT THE CLERGYMAN AND HERSELF AND THUS MUCH OF WOMAN WAS THERE IN HESTER THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY FORGIVE HIM LEAST OF ALL NOW
1250-135782-0039 FOR BEING ABLE SO COMPLETELY TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF FROM THEIR MUTUAL WORLD
1250-135782-0040 WHILE SHE GROPED DARKLY AND STRETCHED FORTH HER COLD HANDS AND FOUND HIM NOT PEARL EITHER SAW AND RESPONDED TO HER MOTHER'S FEELINGS OR HERSELF FELT THE REMOTENESS AND INTANGIBILITY THAT HAD FALLEN AROUND THE MINISTER
1250-135782-0041 WHILE THE PROCESSION PASSED
