6689-64264-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN MARY IN THE SHOP MORE THAN A YEAR HAD NOW PASSED FROM THE OPENING OF MY NARRATIVE IT WAS FULL SUMMER AGAIN AT TESTBRIDGE AND THINGS TO THE CARELESS EYE WERE UNCHANGED
6689-64264-0001 AND TO THE CARELESS MIND WOULD NEVER CHANGE ALTHOUGH IN FACT NOTHING WAS THE SAME AND NOTHING COULD CONTINUE AS IT NOW WAS FOR WERE NOT THE EARTH AND THE SUN A LITTLE COLDER
6689-64264-0002 LETTY WAS GONE AND THE LINK BETWEEN MISTER WARDOUR AND HER NOT ONLY BROKEN BUT A GULF OF SEPARATION IN ITS PLACE NOT THE LESS REMAINED THE GOOD HE HAD GIVEN HER NO GOOD IS EVER LOST THE HEAVENLY PORTER WAS DEPARTED
6689-64264-0003 BUT HAD LEFT THE DOOR WIDE SHE HAD SEEN HIM BUT ONCE SINCE LETTY'S MARRIAGE AND THEN HIS SALUTATION WAS LIKE THAT OF A DEAD MAN IN A DREAM FOR IN HIS SORE HEART HE STILL IMAGINED HER THE CONFIDANTE OF LETTY'S DECEPTION
6689-64264-0004 BUT THE SHADOW OF HER FATHER'S ABSENCE SWALLOWED ALL THE OTHER SHADOWS THE AIR OF WARMTH AND PEACE AND CONSCIOUS SAFETY WHICH HAD HITHERTO SURROUNDED HER WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE COLD EXPOSURE AND ANNOYANCE
6689-64264-0005 BETWEEN THEM HER FATHER AND SHE HAD ORIGINATED A MUTUALLY PROTECTIVE ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE WHEN THAT FAILED THE ATMOSPHERE OF EARTHLY RELATION RUSHED IN AND ENVELOPED HER THE MOMENT OF HER FATHER'S DEPARTURE
6689-64264-0006 MALIGN INFLUENCES INIMICAL TO THE VERY SPRINGS OF HER LIFE CONCENTRATED THEMSELVES UPON HER IT WAS THE DESIGN OF JOHN TURNBULL THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE SO LONG AS SHE DID NOT IRREVOCABLY CAST IN HER LOT WITH HIS FAMILY
6689-64264-0007 AND THE REST IN THE SHOP BEING MOSTLY CREATURES OF HIS OWN CHOICE BY A SORT OF IMPLICIT UNDERSTANDING THEY PROCEEDED TO MAKE HER UNCOMFORTABLE SO LONG AS THEY CONFINED THEMSELVES TO SILENCE NEGLECT AND GENERAL EXCLUSION
6689-64264-0008 MARY HEEDED LITTLE THEIR BEHAVIOR FOR NO INTERCOURSE WITH THEM BEYOND THAT OF EXTERNAL GOOD OFFICES COULD BE BETTER THAN INDIFFERENT TO HER BUT WHEN THEY ADVANCED TO POSITIVE INTERFERENCE HER POSITION BECAME INDEED HARD TO ENDURE
6689-64264-0009 THEY WOULD FOR INSTANCE KEEP WATCH ON HER SERVING AND AS SOON AS THE CUSTOMER WAS GONE WOULD FIND OPEN FAULT WITH THIS OR THAT SHE HAD SAID OR DONE BUT EVEN THIS WAS COMPARATIVELY ENDURABLE
6689-64264-0010 WHEN THEY ADVANCED TO THE INSOLENCE OF DOING THE SAME IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CUSTOMER SHE FOUND IT MORE THAN SHE COULD BEAR WITH EVEN A SHOW OF EQUANIMITY SHE DID HER BEST HOWEVER AND FOR SOME TIME THINGS WENT ON WITHOUT ANY SYMPTOM OF APPROACHING CRISIS
6689-64264-0011 BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THIS SHOULD CONTINUE FOR HAD SHE BEEN CAPABLE OF ENDLESS ENDURANCE HER PERSECUTORS WOULD ONLY HAVE GONE ON TO WORSE BUT MARY WAS NATURALLY QUICK TEMPERED AND THE CHIEF TROUBLE THEY CAUSED HER WAS THE CONTROL OF HER TEMPER
6689-64264-0012 FOR ALTHOUGH SHE HAD EARLY COME TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPERATIVE DUTY OF THIS BRANCH OF SELF GOVERNMENT SHE WAS NOT YET PERFECT IN IT NOT EVERY ONE WHO CAN SERVE UNBOUNDEDLY CAN ENDURE PATIENTLY AND THE MORE GENTLE SOME NATURES
6689-64264-0013 THE MORE THEY RESENT THE RUDENESS WHICH SPRINGS FROM AN OPPOSITE NATURE ABSOLUTELY COURTEOUS THEY FLAME AT DISCOURTESY AND THUS LACK OF THE PERFECTION TO WHICH PATIENCE WOULD AND MUST RAISE THEM
6689-64264-0014 WHEN TURNBULL IN THE NARROW SPACE BEHIND THE COUNTER WOULD PUSH HIS WAY PAST HER WITHOUT OTHER PRETENSE OF APOLOGY THAN SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER SHE DID FEEL FOR A MOMENT AS IF EVIL WERE ABOUT TO HAVE THE VICTORY OVER HER
6689-64264-0015 AND WHEN MISSUS TURNBULL CAME IN WHICH HAPPILY WAS BUT SELDOM SHE FELT AS IF FROM SOME SEPULCHRE IN HER MIND A VERY DEMON SPRANG TO MEET HER FOR SHE BEHAVED TO HER WORST OF ALL
6689-64264-0016 SHE WOULD HEAVE HERSELF IN WITH THE AIR AND LOOK OF A VULGAR DUCHESS FOR FROM THE HEIGHT OF HER SMALL CONSCIOUSNESS SHE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE SHOP AND NEVER ENTERED IT SAVE AS A CUSTOMER THE DAUGHTER OF A SMALL COUNTRY ATTORNEY
6689-64264-0017 WHO NOTWITHSTANDING HIS UNNEGLECTED OPPORTUNITIES HAD NOT BEEN TOO SUCCESSFUL TO ACCEPT AS A HUSBAND FOR HIS DAUGHTER SUCH A TRADESMAN AS JOHN TURNBULL SHE ARROGATED POSITION FROM HER IDEA OF HER FATHER'S POSITION AND
6689-64264-0018 WHILE BITTERLY CHERISHING THE FEELING THAT SHE HAD MARRIED BENEATH HER OBSTINATELY EXCLUDED THE FACT THAT THEREIN SHE HAD DESCENDED TO HER HUSBAND'S LEVEL REGARDING HERSELF MUCH IN THE LIGHT OF A PRINCESS WHOSE DISGUISE TAKES NOTHING FROM HER RANK
6689-64264-0019 SHE WAS LIKE THOSE LADIES WHO HAVING SET THEIR SEAL TO THE DEATH OF THEIR FIRST HUSBANDS BY MARRYING AGAIN YET CLING TO THE TITLE THEY GAVE THEM AND CONTINUE TO CALL THEMSELVES BY THEIR NAME
6689-64264-0020 MISSUS TURNBULL NEVER BOUGHT A DRESS AT THE SHOP NO ONE SHOULD SAY OF HER IT WAS EASY FOR A SNAIL TO LIVE IN A CASTLE SHE TOOK PAINS TO LET HER PRECIOUS PUBLIC KNOW THAT SHE WENT TO LONDON TO MAKE HER PURCHASES
6689-64264-0021 IF SHE DID NOT MENTION ALSO THAT SHE MADE THEM AT THE WAREHOUSES WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS A CUSTOMER PROCURING THEM AT THE SAME PRICE HE WOULD HAVE PAID IT WAS BECAUSE SHE SAW NO OCCASION IT WAS INDEED ONLY FOR SOME SMALL OCCASIONAL NECESSITY
6689-64264-0022 SHE EVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF THE PLACE WHENCE CAME ALL THE MONEY SHE HAD TO SPEND WHEN SHE DID SHE ENTERED IT WITH SUCH AIRS AS SHE IMAGINED TO REPRESENT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SCION OF A COUNTY FAMILY
6689-64264-0023 THERE IS ONE SHOW OF BREEDING VULGARITY SELDOM ASSUMES SIMPLICITY NO SIGN OF RECOGNITION WOULD PASS BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND HERSELF BY ONE STERN REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS ADVANCES
6689-64264-0024 SHE HAD FROM THE FIRST TAUGHT HIM THAT IN THE SHOP THEY WERE STRANGERS HE SAW THE ROCK OF RIDICULE AHEAD AND REQUIRED NO SECOND LESSON WHEN SHE WAS PRESENT HE NEVER KNEW IT GEORGE HAD LEARNED THE LESSON BEFORE HE WENT INTO THE BUSINESS
6689-64264-0025 AND MARY HAD NEVER REQUIRED IT THE OTHERS BEHAVED TO HER AS TO ANY CUSTOMER KNOWN TO STAND UPON HER DIGNITY BUT SHE MADE THEM NO RETURN IN POLITENESS AND THE WAY SHE WOULD ORDER MARY NOW THERE WAS NO FATHER TO OFFEND
6689-64264-0026 WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSING ENOUGH BUT FOR THE IRRITATION ITS EXTREME RUDENESS CAUSED HER SHE DID HOWEVER MANAGE SOMETIMES TO BE AT ONCE BOTH A LITTLE ANGRY AND MUCH AMUSED
6689-64264-0027 SMALL IDEA HAD MISSUS TURNBULL OF THE DIVERSION WHICH ON SUCH OCCASIONS SHE AFFORDED THE CUSTOMERS PRESENT ONE DAY A SHORT TIME BEFORE HER MARRIAGE DELAYED BY THE ILLNESS OF MISTER REDMAIN MISS MORTIMER HAPPENED TO BE IN THE SHOP
6689-64264-0028 AND WAS BEING SERVED BY MARY WHEN MISSUS TURNBULL ENTERED CARELESS OF THE CUSTOMER SHE WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO HER AS IF SHE SAW NONE AND IN A TONE THAT WOULD BE DIGNIFIED AND WAS HAUGHTY DESIRED HER TO BRING HER A REEL OF MARKING COTTON
6689-64264-0029 NOW IT HAD BEEN A PRINCIPLE WITH MARY'S FATHER AND SHE HAD THOROUGHLY LEARNED IT THAT WHATEVER WOULD BE COUNTED A RUDENESS BY ANY CUSTOMER MUST BE SHOWN TO NONE IF ALL ARE EQUAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD HE WOULD SAY
6689-64264-0030 HOW DARE I LEAVE A POOR WOMAN TO SERVE A RICH WOULD I LEAVE ONE COUNTESS TO SERVE ANOTHER MY BUSINESS IS TO SELL IN THE NAME OF CHRIST TO RESPECT PERSONS IN THE SHOP WOULD BE JUST THE SAME AS TO DO IT IN THE CHAPEL AND WOULD BE
6689-64264-0031 TO DENY HIM EXCUSE ME MA'AM SAID MARY I AM WAITING ON MISS MORTIMER AND WENT ON WITH WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT MISSUS TURNBULL FLOUNCED AWAY A LITTLE ABASHED NOT BY MARY BUT BY FINDING WHO THE CUSTOMER WAS
6689-64264-0032 AND COULD NOT ATTEND TO YOU YOUR TONE WAS
6689-64264-0033 CRIED THE GRAND LADY BUT WHAT MORE SHE WOULD HAVE SAID I CAN NOT TELL FOR JUST THEN MISS MORTIMER RESUMED HER PLACE IN FRONT OF MARY SHE HAD NO IDEA OF HER POSITION IN THE SHOP NEITHER SUSPECTED WHO HER ASSAILANT WAS AND
6689-64264-0034 FEARING THE WOMAN'S ACCUSATION MIGHT DO HER AN INJURY FELT COMPELLED TO INTERFERE MISS MARSTON SHE SAID SHE HAD JUST HEARD MISSUS TURNBULL USE HER NAME IF YOU SHOULD BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT BY YOUR EMPLOYER WILL YOU PLEASE REFER TO ME
6689-64264-0035 YOU WERE PERFECTLY CIVIL BOTH TO ME AND TO THIS SHE HESITATED A PERCEPTIBLE MOMENT BUT ENDED WITH THE WORD LADY PECULIARLY TONED THANK YOU MA'AM SAID MARY WITH A SMILE
6689-64264-0036 BUT IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE THIS ANSWER WOULD HAVE ALMOST DRIVEN THE WOMAN OUT OF HER REASON ALREADY BETWEEN ANNOYANCE WITH HERSELF AND ANGER WITH MARY HER HUE WAS PURPLE SOMETHING SHE CALLED HER CONSTITUTION
6689-64264-0037 REQUIRED A NIGHTLY GLASS OF BRANDY AND WATER BUT SHE WAS SO DUMFOUNDED BY MISS MORTIMER'S DEFENSE OF MARY WHICH SHE LOOKED UPON AS AN ASSAULT ON HERSELF SO PAINFULLY AWARE THAT ALL HANDS WERE ARRESTED AND ALL EYES FIXED ON HERSELF
6689-64264-0038 AND SO MORTIFIED WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HER HUSBAND WAS ENJOYING HER DISCOMFITURE THAT WITH WHAT HAUGHTINESS SHE COULD EXTEMPORIZE FROM CONSUMING OFFENSE SHE MADE A SUDDEN VERTICAL GYRATION AND WALKED FROM THE VILE PLACE
6689-64264-0039 NOW GEORGE NEVER LOST A CHANCE OF RECOMMENDING HIMSELF TO MARY BY SIDING WITH HER BUT ONLY AFTER THE BATTLE HE CAME UP TO HER NOW WITH A MEAN UNPLEASANT LOOK INTENDED TO REPRESENT SYMPATHY AND APPROACHING HIS FACE TO HERS
6689-64264-0040 SAID CONFIDENTIALLY WHAT MADE MY MOTHER SPEAK TO YOU LIKE THAT MARY YOU MUST ASK HERSELF SHE ANSWERED THERE YOU ARE AS USUAL MARY HE PROTESTED YOU WILL NEVER LET A FELLOW TAKE YOUR PART
6689-64264-0041 IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE MY PART YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE SO WHEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME GOOD IN IT HOW COULD I BEFORE MISS MORTIMER YOU KNOW THEN WHY DO IT NOW
6689-64264-0042 WELL YOU SEE IT'S HARD TO BEAR HEARING YOU ILL USED WHAT DID YOU SAY TO MISS MORTIMER THAT ANGERED MY MOTHER HIS FATHER HEARD HIM AND TAKING THE CUE CALLED OUT IN THE RUDEST FASHION
