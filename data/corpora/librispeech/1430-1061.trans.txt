1430-1061-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE A VISIT FROM LOUISE THAT DAY WAS DESTINED TO BE AN EVENTFUL ONE FOR WHEN I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND FOUND ELIZA ENSCONCED IN THE UPPER HALL ON A CHAIR WITH MARY ANNE DOING HER BEST
1430-1061-0001 TO STIFLE HER WITH HOUSEHOLD AMMONIA AND LIDDY RUBBING HER WRISTS WHATEVER GOOD THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO I KNEW THAT THE GHOST HAD BEEN WALKING AGAIN AND THIS TIME IN DAYLIGHT ELIZA WAS IN A FRENZY OF FEAR
1430-1061-0002 SHE CLUTCHED AT MY SLEEVE WHEN I WENT CLOSE TO HER AND REFUSED TO LET GO
1430-1061-0003 COMING JUST AFTER THE FIRE THE HOUSEHOLD WAS DEMORALIZED AND IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO ME TO FIND ALEX AND THE UNDER GARDENER STRUGGLING DOWN STAIRS WITH A HEAVY TRUNK BETWEEN THEM
1430-1061-0004 BUT SHE WAS SO EXCITED I WAS AFRAID SHE WOULD DO AS SHE SAID DRAG IT DOWN HERSELF AND SCRATCH THE STAIRCASE I WAS TRYING TO GET MY BONNET OFF AND TO KEEP THE MAIDS QUIET AT THE SAME TIME NOW ELIZA
1430-1061-0005 WHEN YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR FACE AND STOPPED BAWLING I SAID COME INTO MY SITTING ROOM AND TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED LIDDY PUT AWAY MY THINGS WITHOUT SPEAKING THE VERY SET OF HER SHOULDERS EXPRESSED DISAPPROVAL
1430-1061-0006 WELL I SAID WHEN THE SILENCE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS SEEM TO BE WARMING UP SILENCE FROM LIDDY AND A LONG SIGH IF ELIZA GOES I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER COOK
1430-1061-0007 MORE SILENCE ROSIE IS PROBABLY A GOOD COOK SNIFF LIDDY I SAID AT LAST DON'T DARE TO DENY THAT YOU ARE HAVING THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE YOU POSITIVELY GLOAT IN THIS EXCITEMENT
1430-1061-0008 YOU NEVER LOOKED BETTER IT'S MY OPINION ALL THIS RUNNING AROUND AND GETTING JOLTED OUT OF A RUT HAS STIRRED UP THAT TORPID LIVER OF YOURS IT'S NOT MYSELF I'M THINKING ABOUT SHE SAID GOADED INTO SPEECH
1430-1061-0009 AND MAYBE IT WASN'T BUT I KNOW THIS I'VE GOT SOME FEELINGS LEFT AND TO SEE YOU STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THAT STAIRCASE SHOOTIN THROUGH THE DOOR I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME WOMAN AGAIN WELL I'M GLAD OF THAT
1430-1061-0010 ANYTHING FOR A CHANGE I SAID AND IN CAME ELIZA FLANKED BY ROSIE AND MARY ANNE HER STORY BROKEN WITH SOBS AND CORRECTIONS FROM THE OTHER TWO WAS THIS AT TWO O'CLOCK TWO FIFTEEN
1430-1061-0011 ROSIE INSISTED SHE HAD GONE UP STAIRS TO GET A PICTURE FROM HER ROOM TO SHOW MARY ANNE A PICTURE OF A LADY MARY ANNE INTERPOSED SHE WENT UP THE SERVANTS STAIRCASE AND ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO HER ROOM WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE TRUNK ROOM AND THE UNFINISHED BALL ROOM
1430-1061-0012 SHE HEARD A SOUND AS SHE WENT DOWN THE CORRIDOR
1430-1061-0013 BUT SHE LOOKED IN THE TRUNK ROOM AND SAW NOBODY SHE WENT INTO HER ROOM QUIETLY THE NOISE HAD CEASED AND EVERYTHING WAS QUIET THEN SHE SAT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF HER BED AND FEELING FAINT
1430-1061-0014 SHE WAS SUBJECT TO SPELLS I TOLD YOU THAT WHEN I CAME DIDN'T I ROSIE
1430-1061-0015 TOOK A NAP ALL RIGHT I SAID GO ON
1430-1061-0016 I THOUGHT I'D DIE SOMETHIN HIT ME ON THE FACE AND I SET UP SUDDEN AND THEN I SEEN THE PLASTER DROP DROPPIN FROM A LITTLE HOLE IN THE WALL AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW AN IRON BAR THAT LONG
1430-1061-0017 FULLY TWO YARDS BY HER MEASURE SHOT THROUGH THAT HOLE AND TUMBLED ON THE BED
1430-1061-0018 FAINTING CORRECTED ROSIE I'D A BEEN HIT ON THE HEAD AND KILLED I WISHT YOU'D HEARD HER SCREAM PUT IN MARY ANNE AND HER FACE AS WHITE AS A PILLOW SLIP WHEN SHE TUMBLED DOWN THE STAIRS
1430-1061-0019 YOU MAY HAVE DREAMED IT IN YOUR FAINTING ATTACK BUT IF IT IS TRUE THE METAL ROD AND THE HOLE IN THE WALL WILL SHOW IT ELIZA LOOKED A LITTLE BIT SHEEPISH
1430-1061-0020 BUT THE BAR WAS GONE WHEN MARY ANNE AND ROSIE WENT UP TO PACK MY TRUNK THAT WASN'T ALL LIDDY'S VOICE CAME FUNEREALLY FROM A CORNER ELIZA SAID THAT FROM THE HOLE IN THE WALL A BURNING EYE LOOKED DOWN AT HER
1430-1061-0021 THE WALL MUST BE AT LEAST SIX INCHES THICK I SAID WITH ASPERITY UNLESS THE PERSON WHO DRILLED THE HOLE CARRIED HIS EYES ON THE ENDS OF A STICK ELIZA COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN THEM BUT THE FACT REMAINED
1430-1061-0022 AND A VISIT TO ELIZA'S ROOM PROVED IT I MIGHT JEER ALL I WISHED SOME ONE HAD DRILLED A HOLE IN THE UNFINISHED WALL OF THE BALL ROOM PASSING BETWEEN THE BRICKS OF THE PARTITION AND SHOOTING THROUGH THE UNRESISTING PLASTER OF ELIZA'S ROOM WITH SUCH FORCE
1430-1061-0023 AS TO SEND THE ROD FLYING ON TO HER BED I HAD GONE UP STAIRS ALONE AND I CONFESS THE THING PUZZLED ME IN TWO OR THREE PLACES IN THE WALL SMALL APERTURES HAD BEEN MADE NONE OF THEM OF ANY DEPTH
1430-1061-0024 NOT THE LEAST MYSTERIOUS THING WAS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE IRON IMPLEMENT THAT HAD BEEN USED I REMEMBERED A STORY I READ ONCE ABOUT AN IMPISH DWARF THAT LIVED IN THE SPACES BETWEEN THE DOUBLE WALLS OF AN ANCIENT CASTLE
1430-1061-0025 I WONDERED VAGUELY IF MY ORIGINAL IDEA OF A SECRET ENTRANCE TO A HIDDEN CHAMBER COULD BE RIGHT AFTER ALL AND IF WE WERE HOUSING SOME ERRATIC GUEST WHO PLAYED PRANKS ON US IN THE DARK AND DESTROYED THE WALLS THAT HE MIGHT LISTEN HIDDEN SAFELY AWAY
1430-1061-0026 TO OUR AMAZED INVESTIGATIONS MARY ANNE AND ELIZA LEFT THAT AFTERNOON BUT ROSIE DECIDED TO STAY IT WAS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN THE HACK CAME FROM THE STATION TO GET THEM AND TO MY AMAZEMENT IT HAD AN OCCUPANT
1430-1061-0027 WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME TO COME UP FOR TWO GIRLS AND THEIR TRUNKS I SUPPOSED THERE WAS SOMETHING DOING AND AS THIS HERE WOMAN HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK IN THE VILLAGE I THOUGHT I'D BRING HER ALONG ALREADY I HAD ACQUIRED THE TRUE SUBURBANITE ABILITY TO
1430-1061-0028 TAKE SERVANTS ON FAITH I NO LONGER DEMANDED WRITTEN AND UNIMPEACHABLE REFERENCES I
1430-1061-0029 HAVE LEARNED NOT TO MIND IF THE COOK SITS DOWN COMFORTABLY IN MY SITTING ROOM WHEN SHE IS TAKING THE ORDERS FOR THE DAY
1430-1061-0030 WHEN SHE CAME HOWEVER I COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN A GASP OF SURPRISE IT WAS THE WOMAN WITH THE PITTED FACE SHE STOOD SOMEWHAT AWKWARDLY JUST INSIDE THE DOOR AND SHE HAD AN AIR OF SELF CONFIDENCE THAT WAS INSPIRING
1430-1061-0031 YES SHE COULD COOK WAS NOT A FANCY COOK BUT COULD MAKE GOOD SOUPS AND DESSERTS IF THERE WAS ANY ONE TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE SALADS AND SO IN THE END I TOOK HER AS HALSEY SAID WHEN WE TOLD HIM
1430-1061-0032 IT DIDN'T MATTER MUCH ABOUT THE COOK'S FACE IF IT WAS CLEAN I HAVE SPOKEN OF HALSEY'S RESTLESSNESS ON THAT DAY IT SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN EVER A RESISTLESS IMPULSE THAT KEPT HIM OUT UNTIL AFTER LUNCHEON I THINK HE HOPED CONSTANTLY
1430-1061-0033 THAT HE MIGHT MEET LOUISE DRIVING OVER THE HILLS IN HER RUNABOUT POSSIBLY HE DID MEET HER OCCASIONALLY BUT FROM HIS CONTINUED GLOOM I FELT SURE THE SITUATION BETWEEN THEM WAS UNCHANGED
1430-1061-0034 PART OF THE AFTERNOON I BELIEVE HE READ GERTRUDE AND I WERE OUT AS I HAVE SAID AND AT DINNER WE BOTH NOTICED THAT SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED TO DISTRACT HIM HE WAS DISAGREEABLE WHICH IS UNLIKE HIM NERVOUS
1430-1061-0035 LOOKING AT HIS WATCH EVERY FEW MINUTES AND HE ATE ALMOST NOTHING HE ASKED TWICE DURING THE MEAL ON WHAT TRAIN MISTER JAMIESON AND THE OTHER DETECTIVE WERE COMING
1430-1061-0036 HE DUG HIS FORK INTO MY DAMASK CLOTH AND DID NOT HEAR WHEN HE WAS SPOKEN TO HE REFUSED DESSERT AND LEFT THE TABLE EARLY EXCUSING HIMSELF ON THE GROUND THAT HE WANTED TO SEE ALEX
1430-1061-0037 WAS NOT TO BE FOUND IT WAS AFTER EIGHT WHEN HALSEY ORDERED THE CAR AND STARTED DOWN THE HILL AT A PACE THAT EVEN FOR HIM WAS UNUSUALLY RECKLESS SHORTLY AFTER ALEX REPORTED THAT HE WAS READY TO GO OVER THE HOUSE PREPARATORY
1430-1061-0038 TO CLOSING IT FOR THE NIGHT SAM BOHANNON CAME AT A QUARTER BEFORE NINE AND BEGAN HIS PATROL OF THE GROUNDS AND WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE TWO DETECTIVES TO LOOK FORWARD TO
1430-1061-0039 AT HALF PAST NINE I HEARD THE SOUND OF A HORSE DRIVEN FURIOUSLY UP THE DRIVE IT CAME TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THERE WERE HURRIED STEPS ON THE VERANDA OUR
1430-1061-0040 AND GERTRUDE ALWAYS APPREHENSIVE LATELY WAS AT THE DOOR ALMOST INSTANTLY A MOMENT LATER LOUISE HAD BURST INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD THERE BAREHEADED AND BREATHING HARD WHERE IS HALSEY SHE DEMANDED
1430-1061-0041 ABOVE HER PLAIN BLACK GOWN HER EYES LOOKED BIG AND SOMBER AND THE RAPID DRIVE HAD BROUGHT NO COLOR TO HER FACE I GOT UP AND DREW FORWARD A CHAIR HE HAS NOT COME BACK I SAID QUIETLY SIT DOWN CHILD
1430-1061-0042 YOU ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THIS KIND OF THING I DON'T THINK SHE EVEN HEARD ME HE HAS NOT COME BACK SHE ASKED LOOKING FROM ME TO GERTRUDE
1430-1061-0043 WHERE CAN I FIND HIM FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LOUISE GERTRUDE BURST OUT TELL US WHAT IS WRONG
1430-1061-0044 HE HAS GONE TO THE STATION FOR MISTER JAMIESON WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE STATION
1430-1061-0045 YES I SAID LISTEN THERE IS THE WHISTLE OF THE TRAIN NOW SHE RELAXED A LITTLE AT OUR MATTER OF FACT TONE AND ALLOWED HERSELF TO SINK INTO A CHAIR PERHAPS I WAS WRONG SHE SAID HEAVILY HE
1430-1061-0046 WILL BE HERE IN A FEW MOMENTS
1430-1061-0047 EVERYTHING IS RIGHT WE SAT THERE THE THREE OF US WITHOUT ATTEMPT AT CONVERSATION BOTH GERTRUDE AND I RECOGNIZED THE FUTILITY OF ASKING LOUISE ANY QUESTIONS HER RETICENCE WAS A PART OF A ROLE SHE HAD ASSUMED
1430-1061-0048 OUR EARS WERE STRAINED FOR THE FIRST THROB OF THE MOTOR AS IT TURNED INTO THE DRIVE AND COMMENCED THE CLIMB TO THE HOUSE TEN MINUTES PASSED FIFTEEN TWENTY I SAW LOUISE'S HANDS GROW RIGID AS THEY CLUTCHED THE ARMS OF HER CHAIR
1430-1061-0049 I WATCHED GERTRUDE'S BRIGHT COLOR SLOWLY EBBING AWAY AND AROUND MY OWN HEART I SEEMED TO FEEL THE GRASP OF A GIANT HAND TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN A SOUND BUT IT WAS NOT THE CHUG OF THE MOTOR
1430-1061-0050 IT WAS THE UNMISTAKABLE RUMBLE OF THE CASANOVA HACK GERTRUDE DREW ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS IT'S THE HACK I AM SURE SHE SAID EVIDENTLY RELIEVED SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE CAR AND NO WONDER
1430-1061-0051 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE THE CREAKING VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP AT THE DOOR LOUISE ROSE AND STOOD WATCHING HER HAND TO HER THROAT AND THEN GERTRUDE OPENED THE DOOR ADMITTING MISTER JAMIESON AND A STOCKY MIDDLE AGED MAN
1430-1061-0052 WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED AND LOUISE REALIZED THAT HALSEY HAD NOT COME HER EXPRESSION CHANGED FROM TENSE WATCHFULNESS TO RELIEF AND NOW AGAIN TO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR HER FACE WAS AN OPEN PAGE
1430-1061-0053 I ASKED UNCEREMONIOUSLY IGNORING THE STRANGER DID HE NOT MEET YOU NO MISTER JAMIESON LOOKED SLIGHTLY SURPRISED I RATHER EXPECTED THE CAR BUT WE GOT UP ALL RIGHT YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM AT ALL
1430-1061-0054 LOUISE DEMANDED BREATHLESSLY MISTER JAMIESON KNEW HER AT ONCE ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT SEEN HER BEFORE SHE HAD KEPT TO HER ROOMS UNTIL THE MORNING SHE LEFT NO MISS ARMSTRONG HE SAID I SAW NOTHING OF HIM WHAT IS WRONG
1430-1061-0055 EVERY INSTANT IS PRECIOUS MISTER JAMIESON I HAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT HE IS IN DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ONLY HE MUST BE FOUND
1430-1061-0056 NOW HOWEVER HE WENT QUICKLY TOWARD THE DOOR I'LL CATCH THE HACK DOWN THE ROAD AND HOLD IT HE SAID IS THE GENTLEMAN DOWN IN THE TOWN MISTER JAMIESON LOUISE SAID IMPULSIVELY I CAN USE THE HACK
1430-1061-0057 TAKE MY HORSE AND TRAP OUTSIDE AND DRIVE LIKE MAD TRY TO FIND THE DRAGON FLY IT OUGHT TO BE EASY TO TRACE I CAN THINK OF NO OTHER WAY ONLY DON'T LOSE A MOMENT THE NEW DETECTIVE HAD GONE AND A MOMENT LATER
1430-1061-0058 JAMIESON WENT RAPIDLY DOWN THE DRIVE THE COB'S FEET STRIKING FIRE AT EVERY STEP LOUISE STOOD LOOKING AFTER THEM WHEN SHE TURNED AROUND SHE FACED GERTRUDE WHO STOOD INDIGNANT ALMOST TRAGIC IN THE HALL
1430-1061-0059 SHE SAID ACCUSINGLY I BELIEVE YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE HORRIBLE THING THIS MYSTERY THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HALSEY I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
1430-1061-0060 I TRIED TO WARN HIM NONSENSE I SAID
1430-1061-0061 HE IS ALWAYS LATE ANY MOMENT WE MAY HEAR THE CAR COMING UP THE ROAD BUT IT DID NOT COME AFTER A HALF HOUR OF SUSPENSE LOUISE WENT OUT QUIETLY AND DID NOT COME BACK I HARDLY KNEW SHE WAS GONE
1430-1061-0062 AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE TELEPHONE RANG IT WAS MISTER JAMIESON
1430-1061-0063 IT HAS COLLIDED WITH A FREIGHT CAR ON THE SIDING ABOVE THE STATION
1430-1061-0064 BUT WE SHALL PROBABLY FIND HIM SEND WARNER FOR THE CAR BUT THEY DID NOT FIND HIM AT FOUR O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING
1430-1061-0065 AT DAYLIGHT I DROPPED INTO EXHAUSTED SLEEP HALSEY HAD NOT COME BACK
