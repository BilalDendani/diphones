5325-36587-0000 ARRESTS OF DEVELOPMENT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT AND ARRESTED GROWTH FOR PARTS IN THE FORMER STATE CONTINUE TO GROW WHILST STILL RETAINING THEIR EARLY CONDITION VARIOUS MONSTROSITIES COME UNDER THIS HEAD AND SOME AS A CLEFT PALATE
5325-36587-0001 THEY CANNOT ACQUIRE THE POWER OF SPEECH AND ARE WHOLLY INCAPABLE OF PROLONGED ATTENTION BUT ARE MUCH GIVEN TO IMITATION THEY ARE STRONG AND REMARKABLY ACTIVE CONTINUALLY GAMBOLLING AND JUMPING ABOUT AND MAKING GRIMACES
5325-36587-0002 THEY OFTEN ASCEND STAIRS ON ALL FOURS AND ARE CURIOUSLY FOND OF CLIMBING UP FURNITURE OR TREES WE ARE THUS REMINDED OF THE DELIGHT SHEWN BY ALMOST ALL BOYS IN CLIMBING TREES AND THIS AGAIN REMINDS US HOW LAMBS AND KIDS ORIGINALLY ALPINE ANIMALS
5325-36587-0003 DELIGHT TO FRISK ON ANY HILLOCK HOWEVER SMALL IDIOTS ALSO RESEMBLE THE LOWER ANIMALS IN SOME OTHER RESPECTS THUS SEVERAL CASES ARE RECORDED OF THEIR CAREFULLY SMELLING EVERY MOUTHFUL OF FOOD BEFORE EATING IT
5325-36587-0004 ONE IDIOT IS DESCRIBED AS OFTEN USING HIS MOUTH IN AID OF HIS HANDS WHILST HUNTING FOR LICE THEY ARE OFTEN FILTHY IN THEIR HABITS
5325-36587-0005 IN SOME LOWER AND ADULT MEMBER OF THE SAME GROUP IT MAY IN ONE SENSE BE CONSIDERED AS A CASE OF REVERSION THE LOWER MEMBERS IN A GROUP GIVE US SOME IDEA HOW THE COMMON PROGENITOR WAS PROBABLY CONSTRUCTED AND IT IS HARDLY CREDIBLE
5325-36587-0006 THAT A COMPLEX PART ARRESTED AT AN EARLY PHASE OF EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT SHOULD GO ON GROWING SO AS ULTIMATELY TO PERFORM ITS PROPER FUNCTION UNLESS IT HAD ACQUIRED SUCH POWER DURING SOME EARLIER STATE OF EXISTENCE WHEN THE PRESENT EXCEPTIONAL
5325-36587-0007 OR ARRESTED STRUCTURE WAS NORMAL THE SIMPLE BRAIN OF A MICROCEPHALOUS IDIOT IN AS FAR AS IT RESEMBLES THAT OF AN APE MAY IN THIS SENSE BE SAID TO OFFER A CASE OF REVERSION THIRTY EIGHT
5325-36587-0008 IS THUS MUCH WEAKENED NEVERTHELESS IT STILL SEEMS TO ME PROBABLE BECAUSE TWO PAIRS ARE OFTEN FOUND SYMMETRICALLY ON THE BREAST AND OF THIS I MYSELF HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION IN SEVERAL CASES IT IS WELL KNOWN
5325-36587-0009 THAT SOME LEMURS NORMALLY HAVE TWO PAIRS OF MAMMAE ON THE BREAST FIVE CASES HAVE BEEN RECORDED OF THE PRESENCE OF MORE THAN A PAIR OF MAMMAE OF COURSE RUDIMENTARY IN THE MALE SEX OF MANKIND
5325-36587-0010 IN WHICH TWO BROTHERS EXHIBITED THIS PECULIARITY
5325-36587-0011 IN REICHERT'S AND DU BOIS REYMOND'S ARCHIV EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO P THREE HUNDRED FOUR IN ONE OF THE CASES ALLUDED TO BY DOCTOR BARTELS A MAN BORE FIVE MAMMAE ONE BEING MEDIAL AND PLACED ABOVE THE NAVEL
5325-36587-0012 MECKEL VON HEMSBACH THINKS THAT THIS LATTER CASE IS ILLUSTRATED BY A MEDIAL MAMMA OCCURRING IN CERTAIN CHEIROPTERA ON THE WHOLE WE MAY WELL DOUBT IF ADDITIONAL MAMMAE WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN BOTH SEXES OF MANKIND HAD NOT HIS EARLY PROGENITORS BEEN PROVIDED WITH MORE THAN A SINGLE PAIR
5325-36587-0013 I ALSO ATTRIBUTED THOUGH WITH MUCH HESITATION
5325-36587-0014 WHICH IS PROVIDED WITH ARTICULATED BONY RAYS ON BOTH SIDES OF A CENTRAL CHAIN OF BONES THERE SEEMS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ADMITTING THAT SIX OR MORE DIGITS ON ONE SIDE OR ON BOTH SIDES MIGHT REAPPEAR THROUGH REVERSION
5325-36587-0015 I AM INFORMED BY DOCTOR ZOUTEVEEN THAT THERE IS A CASE ON RECORD OF A MAN HAVING TWENTY FOUR FINGERS AND TWENTY FOUR TOES I WAS CHIEFLY LED TO THE CONCLUSION
5325-36587-0016 THAT THE PRESENCE OF SUPERNUMERARY DIGITS MIGHT BE DUE TO REVERSION FROM THE FACT THAT SUCH DIGITS NOT ONLY ARE STRONGLY INHERITED BUT AS I THEN BELIEVED HAD THE POWER OF REGROWTH AFTER AMPUTATION LIKE THE NORMAL DIGITS OF THE LOWER VERTEBRATA
5325-36587-0017 BUT I HAVE EXPLAINED IN THE SECOND EDITION OF MY VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION WHY I NOW PLACE LITTLE RELIANCE ON THE RECORDED CASES OF SUCH REGROWTH NEVERTHELESS IT DESERVES NOTICE
5325-36587-0018 INASMUCH AS ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT AND REVERSION ARE INTIMATELY RELATED PROCESSES THAT VARIOUS STRUCTURES IN AN EMBRYONIC OR ARRESTED CONDITION SUCH AS A CLEFT PALATE
5325-36587-0019 ARE FREQUENTLY ACCOMPANIED BY POLYDACTYLISM THIS HAS BEEN STRONGLY INSISTED ON BY MECKEL AND ISIDORE GEOFFROY SAINT HILAIRE BUT AT PRESENT IT IS THE SAFEST COURSE TO GIVE UP ALTOGETHER THE IDEA THAT THERE IS ANY RELATION BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERNUMERARY DIGITS
5325-36587-0020 AND REVERSION TO SOME LOWLY ORGANISED PROGENITOR OF MAN
5325-36587-0021 THERE ARE OTHER CASES WHICH COME MORE STRICTLY UNDER OUR PRESENT HEAD OF REVERSION CERTAIN STRUCTURES REGULARLY OCCURRING IN THE LOWER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP TO WHICH MAN BELONGS OCCASIONALLY MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE IN HIM THOUGH NOT FOUND IN THE NORMAL HUMAN EMBRYO OR
5325-36587-0022 IF NORMALLY PRESENT IN THE HUMAN EMBRYO THEY BECOME ABNORMALLY DEVELOPED ALTHOUGH IN A MANNER WHICH IS NORMAL IN THE LOWER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP THESE REMARKS WILL BE RENDERED CLEARER BY THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATIONS IN VARIOUS MAMMALS
5325-36587-0023 THE UTERUS GRADUATES FROM A DOUBLE ORGAN WITH TWO DISTINCT ORIFICES AND TWO PASSAGES AS IN THE MARSUPIALS
5325-36587-0024 WHICH IS IN NO WAY DOUBLE EXCEPT FROM HAVING A SLIGHT INTERNAL FOLD AS IN THE HIGHER APES AND MAN THE RODENTS EXHIBIT A PERFECT SERIES OF GRADATIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREME STATES
5325-36587-0025 IN ALL MAMMALS THE UTERUS IS DEVELOPED FROM TWO SIMPLE PRIMITIVE TUBES THE INFERIOR PORTIONS OF WHICH FORM THE CORNUA AND IT IS IN THE WORDS OF DOCTOR FARRE BY THE COALESCENCE OF THE TWO CORNUA AT THEIR LOWER EXTREMITIES
5325-36587-0026 THAT THE BODY OF THE UTERUS IS FORMED IN MAN WHILE IN THOSE ANIMALS IN WHICH NO MIDDLE PORTION OR BODY EXISTS THE CORNUA REMAIN UNUNITED AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UTERUS PROCEEDS THE TWO CORNUA BECOME GRADUALLY SHORTER
5325-36587-0027 UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ARE LOST OR AS IT WERE ABSORBED INTO THE BODY OF THE UTERUS THE ANGLES OF THE UTERUS ARE STILL PRODUCED INTO CORNUA EVEN IN ANIMALS AS HIGH UP IN THE SCALE AS THE LOWER APES AND LEMURS
5325-36587-0028 NOW IN WOMEN ANOMALOUS CASES ARE NOT VERY INFREQUENT IN WHICH THE MATURE UTERUS IS FURNISHED WITH CORNUA OR IS PARTIALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO ORGANS AND SUCH CASES ACCORDING TO OWEN REPEAT
5325-36587-0029 THE GRADE OF CONCENTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT ATTAINED BY CERTAIN RODENTS HERE PERHAPS WE HAVE AN INSTANCE OF A SIMPLE ARREST OF EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT WITH SUBSEQUENT GROWTH AND PERFECT FUNCTIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EITHER SIDE OF THE PARTIALLY DOUBLE UTERUS
5325-36587-0030 THOUGH PERHAPS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE TWO SIMPLE MINUTE PRIMITIVE TUBES SHOULD KNOW HOW IF SUCH AN EXPRESSION MAY BE USED
5325-36587-0031 EACH WITH A WELL CONSTRUCTED ORIFICE AND PASSAGE AND EACH FURNISHED WITH NUMEROUS MUSCLES NERVES GLANDS AND VESSELS IF THEY HAD NOT FORMERLY PASSED THROUGH A SIMILAR COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT AS IN THE CASE OF EXISTING MARSUPIALS
5325-36587-0032 NO ONE WILL PRETEND THAT SO PERFECT A STRUCTURE AS THE ABNORMAL DOUBLE UTERUS IN WOMAN COULD BE THE RESULT OF MERE CHANCE BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF REVERSION BY WHICH A LONG LOST STRUCTURE IS CALLED BACK INTO EXISTENCE MIGHT SERVE AS THE GUIDE FOR ITS FULL DEVELOPMENT
5325-36587-0033 IT SOMETIMES REMAINS THUS IN MAN WHEN ADULT MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE LOWER PROGNATHOUS RACES HENCE CANESTRINI CONCLUDES THAT SOME ANCIENT PROGENITOR OF MAN MUST HAVE HAD THIS BONE NORMALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO PORTIONS WHICH AFTERWARDS BECAME FUSED TOGETHER
5325-36587-0034 ACCORDING TO MY THEORY EVERY TRANSIENT CONDITION OF AN ORGAN DURING ITS DEVELOPMENT IS NOT ONLY A MEANS TO AN END BUT ONCE WAS AN END IN ITSELF THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO ME NECESSARILY TO HOLD GOOD WHY SHOULD NOT VARIATIONS OCCUR
5325-36587-0035 DURING AN EARLY PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT HAVING NO RELATION TO REVERSION YET SUCH VARIATIONS MIGHT BE PRESERVED AND ACCUMULATED IF IN ANY WAY SERVICEABLE FOR INSTANCE
5325-36587-0036 AND BY A STRONGER FANG THAN THE INCISORS NEVERTHELESS THIS TOOTH NO LONGER SERVES MAN AS A SPECIAL WEAPON FOR TEARING HIS ENEMIES OR PREY IT MAY THEREFORE AS FAR AS ITS PROPER FUNCTION IS CONCERNED
5325-36587-0037 ARE LEFT FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE CANINES OF THE OPPOSITE JAW AN INTER SPACE OF THIS KIND IN A KAFFIR SKULL
5325-36587-0038 NO TRACE OF IT IN ONLY TWO OUT OF THIRTY FEMALE SUBJECTS WAS THIS MUSCLE DEVELOPED ON BOTH SIDES BUT IN THREE OTHERS THE RUDIMENTARY LIGAMENT WAS PRESENT THIS MUSCLE THEREFORE APPEARS TO BE MUCH MORE COMMON IN THE MALE THAN IN THE FEMALE SEX
5325-36587-0039 AND ON THE BELIEF IN THE DESCENT OF MAN FROM SOME LOWER FORM THE FACT IS INTELLIGIBLE FOR IT HAS BEEN DETECTED IN SEVERAL OF THE LOWER ANIMALS
5325-36587-0040 IN OUR NEAREST ALLIES THE QUADRUMANA ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO BE HERE EVEN SPECIFIED IN A SINGLE MALE SUBJECT HAVING A STRONG BODILY FRAME AND WELL FORMED SKULL NO LESS THAN SEVEN MUSCULAR VARIATIONS WERE OBSERVED
5325-36587-0041 ALL OF WHICH PLAINLY REPRESENTED MUSCLES PROPER TO VARIOUS KINDS OF APES THIS MAN FOR INSTANCE HAD ON BOTH SIDES OF HIS NECK A TRUE AND POWERFUL
5325-36587-0042 AND OTHERS IN WOMAN WITHOUT OUR BEING ABLE TO ASSIGN ANY REASON MISTER WOOD AFTER DESCRIBING NUMEROUS VARIATIONS
5325-36587-0043 OF THUMB AND FINGERS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MACAQUE BUT WHETHER SUCH A CASE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A MACAQUE PASSING UPWARDS INTO A MAN OR A MAN PASSING DOWNWARDS INTO A MACAQUE OR AS A CONGENITAL FREAK OF NATURE I CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO SAY
5325-36587-0044 IT IS SATISFACTORY TO HEAR SO CAPABLE AN ANATOMIST AND SO EMBITTERED AN OPPONENT OF EVOLUTIONISM ADMITTING EVEN THE POSSIBILITY
5325-36587-0045 AND HOW OFTEN AND HOW CLOSELY THE VARIATIONS RESEMBLE THE NORMAL MUSCLES OF THE LOWER ANIMALS HE SUMS UP BY REMARKING IT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR MY PURPOSE IF I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SHEWING THE MORE IMPORTANT FORMS WHICH WHEN OCCURRING AS VARIETIES IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT
5325-36587-0046 TEND TO EXHIBIT IN A SUFFICIENTLY MARKED MANNER WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS PROOFS AND EXAMPLES OF THE DARWINIAN PRINCIPLE OF REVERSION OR LAW OF INHERITANCE IN THIS DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMICAL SCIENCE
5325-36587-0047 IT IS QUITE INCREDIBLE
5325-36587-0048 ON THE OTHER HAND IF MAN IS DESCENDED FROM SOME APE LIKE CREATURE
5325-36587-0049 WHY CERTAIN MUSCLES SHOULD NOT SUDDENLY REAPPEAR AFTER AN INTERVAL OF MANY THOUSAND GENERATIONS
5325-36587-0050 ASSES AND MULES DARK COLOURED STRIPES SUDDENLY REAPPEAR ON THE LEGS AND SHOULDERS AFTER AN INTERVAL OF HUNDREDS OR MORE PROBABLY OF THOUSANDS OF GENERATIONS
5325-36587-0051 THESE VARIOUS CASES OF REVERSION ARE SO CLOSELY RELATED TO THOSE OF RUDIMENTARY ORGANS GIVEN IN THE FIRST CHAPTER THAT MANY OF THEM MIGHT HAVE BEEN INDIFFERENTLY INTRODUCED EITHER THERE OR HERE THUS A HUMAN UTERUS FURNISHED WITH CORNUA
5325-36587-0052 MAY BE SAID TO REPRESENT IN A RUDIMENTARY CONDITION THE SAME ORGAN IN ITS NORMAL STATE IN CERTAIN MAMMALS SOME PARTS WHICH ARE RUDIMENTARY IN MAN AS THE OS COCCYX IN BOTH SEXES AND THE MAMMAE IN THE MALE SEX ARE ALWAYS PRESENT WHILST OTHERS
5325-36587-0053 ONLY OCCASIONALLY APPEAR AND THEREFORE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED UNDER THE HEAD OF REVERSION THESE SEVERAL REVERSIONARY STRUCTURES AS WELL AS THE STRICTLY RUDIMENTARY ONES REVEAL THE DESCENT OF MAN FROM SOME LOWER FORM IN AN UNMISTAKABLE MANNER
5325-36587-0054 CORRELATED VARIATION IN MAN AS IN THE LOWER ANIMALS MANY STRUCTURES ARE SO INTIMATELY RELATED THAT WHEN ONE PART VARIES SO DOES ANOTHER
5325-36587-0055 WITHOUT OUR BEING ABLE IN MOST CASES TO ASSIGN ANY REASON WE CANNOT SAY WHETHER THE ONE PART GOVERNS THE OTHER OR WHETHER BOTH ARE GOVERNED BY SOME EARLIER DEVELOPED PART VARIOUS MONSTROSITIES AS I GEOFFROY REPEATEDLY INSISTS
5325-36587-0056 ARE THUS INTIMATELY CONNECTED HOMOLOGOUS STRUCTURES ARE PARTICULARLY LIABLE TO CHANGE TOGETHER AS WE SEE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE BODY
