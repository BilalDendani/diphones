8474-281187-0000 ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES
8474-281187-0001 THERE ONCE LIVED IN A TOWN OF PERSIA TWO BROTHERS ONE NAMED CASSIM AND THE OTHER ALI BABA THEIR FATHER DIVIDED A SMALL INHERITANCE EQUALLY BETWEEN THEM CASSIM MARRIED A VERY RICH WIFE AND BECAME A WEALTHY MERCHANT
8474-281187-0002 ALI BABA MARRIED A WOMAN AS POOR AS HIMSELF AND LIVED BY CUTTING WOOD AND BRINGING IT UPON THREE ASSES INTO THE TOWN TO SELL ONE DAY WHEN ALI BABA WAS IN THE FOREST
8474-281187-0003 HE SAW AT A DISTANCE A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST WHICH SEEMED TO APPROACH HIM HE OBSERVED IT WITH ATTENTION AND DISTINGUISHED SOON AFTER A BODY OF HORSEMEN WHOM HE SUSPECTED MIGHT BE ROBBERS HE DETERMINED TO LEAVE HIS ASSES TO SAVE HIMSELF
8474-281187-0004 HE CLIMBED UP A LARGE TREE PLANTED ON A HIGH ROCK WHOSE BRANCHES WERE THICK ENOUGH TO CONCEAL HIM AND YET ENABLED HIM TO SEE ALL THAT PASSED WITHOUT BEING DISCOVERED THE TROOP WHO WERE TO THE NUMBER OF FORTY ALL WELL MOUNTED AND ARMED
8474-281187-0005 CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE ROCK ON WHICH THE TREE STOOD AND THERE DISMOUNTED EVERY MAN UNBRIDLED HIS HORSE TIED HIM TO SOME SHRUB AND HUNG ABOUT HIS NECK A BAG OF CORN WHICH THEY BROUGHT BEHIND THEM THEN EACH OF THEM TOOK OFF HIS SADDLE BAG
8474-281187-0006 HE FOLLOWED THEM WHEN THE DOOR SHUT AGAIN OF ITSELF THE ROBBERS STAYED SOME TIME WITHIN THE ROCK DURING WHICH ALI BABA FEARFUL OF BEING CAUGHT REMAINED IN THE TREE AT LAST THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN AND AS THE CAPTAIN WENT IN LAST
8474-281187-0007 SO HE CAME OUT FIRST AND STOOD TO SEE THEM ALL PASS BY HIM WHEN ALI BABA HEARD HIM MAKE THE DOOR CLOSE BY PRONOUNCING THESE WORDS SHUT SESAME EVERY MAN AT ONCE WENT AND BRIDLED HIS HORSE FASTENED HIS WALLET
8474-281187-0008 AND MOUNTED AGAIN WHEN THE CAPTAIN SAW THEM ALL READY HE PUT HIMSELF AT THEIR HEAD AND THEY RETURNED THE WAY THEY HAD COME ALI BABA FOLLOWED THEM WITH HIS EYES AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE THEM AND AFTERWARD STAYED A CONSIDERABLE TIME BEFORE HE DESCENDED
8474-281187-0009 HE HAD THE CURIOSITY TO TRY IF HIS PRONOUNCING THEM WOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ACCORDINGLY HE WENT AMONG THE SHRUBS AND PERCEIVING THE DOOR CONCEALED BEHIND THEM STOOD BEFORE IT AND SAID OPEN SESAME THE DOOR INSTANTLY FLEW WIDE OPEN
8474-281187-0010 BROCADE AND VALUABLE CARPETING PILED UPON ONE ANOTHER GOLD AND SILVER INGOTS IN GREAT HEAPS AND MONEY IN BAGS
8474-281187-0011 ALI BABA WENT BOLDLY INTO THE CAVE AND COLLECTED AS MUCH OF THE GOLD COIN WHICH WAS IN BAGS AS HE THOUGHT HIS THREE ASSES COULD CARRY WHEN HE HAD LOADED THEM WITH THE BAGS HE LAID WOOD OVER THEM IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY COULD NOT BE SEEN
8474-281187-0012 WHEN HE HAD PASSED IN AND OUT AS OFTEN AS HE WISHED HE STOOD BEFORE THE DOOR AND PRONOUNCING THE WORDS SHUT SESAME THE DOOR CLOSED OF ITSELF HE THEN MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY TO TOWN WHEN ALI BABA GOT HOME
8474-281187-0013 HE DROVE HIS ASSES INTO A LITTLE YARD SHUT THE GATES VERY CAREFULLY THREW OFF THE WOOD THAT COVERED THE PANNIERS CARRIED THE BAGS INTO THE HOUSE AND RANGED THEM IN ORDER BEFORE HIS WIFE HE THEN EMPTIED THE BAGS
8474-281187-0014 WHICH RAISED SUCH A GREAT HEAP OF GOLD AS DAZZLED HIS WIFE'S EYES AND THEN HE TOLD HER THE WHOLE ADVENTURE FROM BEGINNING TO END AND ABOVE ALL RECOMMENDED HER TO KEEP IT SECRET THE WIFE REJOICED GREATLY AT THEIR GOOD FORTUNE AND WOULD COUNT ALL THE GOLD PIECE BY PIECE
8474-281187-0015 WIFE REPLIED ALI BABA YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU UNDERTAKE WHEN YOU PRETEND TO COUNT THE MONEY YOU WILL NEVER HAVE DONE I WILL DIG A HOLE AND BURY IT THERE IS NO TIME TO BE LOST YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT HUSBAND REPLIED SHE BUT LET US KNOW AS NIGH AS POSSIBLE
8474-281187-0016 HOW MUCH WE HAVE I WILL BORROW A SMALL MEASURE AND MEASURE IT WHILE YOU DIG THE HOLE AWAY THE WIFE RAN TO HER BROTHER IN LAW CASSIM WHO LIVED JUST BY AND ADDRESSING HERSELF TO HIS WIFE DESIRED HER TO LEND HER A MEASURE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
8474-281187-0017 THE OTHER ASKED FOR A SMALL ONE SHE BADE HER STAY A LITTLE AND SHE WOULD READILY FETCH ONE THE SISTER IN LAW DID SO BUT AS SHE KNEW ALI BABA'S POVERTY SHE WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF GRAIN HIS WIFE WANTED TO MEASURE
8474-281187-0018 AND EMPTIED IT OFTEN UPON THE SOFA TILL SHE HAD DONE WHEN SHE WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED TO FIND THE NUMBER OF MEASURES AMOUNTED TO SO MANY AS THEY DID
8474-281187-0019 WHO HAD ALMOST FINISHED DIGGING THE HOLE WHILE ALI BABA WAS BURYING THE GOLD HIS WIFE TO SHOW HER EXACTNESS AND DILIGENCE TO HER SISTER IN LAW CARRIED THE MEASURE BACK AGAIN BUT WITHOUT TAKING NOTICE THAT A PIECE OF GOLD HAD STUCK TO THE BOTTOM SISTER
8474-281187-0020 SAID SHE GIVING IT TO HER AGAIN YOU SEE THAT I HAVE NOT KEPT YOUR MEASURE LONG I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR IT AND RETURN IT WITH THANKS AS SOON AS ALI BABA'S WIFE WAS GONE CASSIM'S WIFE LOOKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MEASURE
8474-281187-0021 AND WAS IN INEXPRESSIBLE SURPRISE TO FIND A PIECE OF GOLD STICKING TO IT ENVY IMMEDIATELY POSSESSED HER BREAST WHAT SAID SHE HAS ALI BABA GOLD SO PLENTIFUL AS TO MEASURE IT WHENCE HAS HE ALL THIS WEALTH
8474-281187-0022 CASSIM HER HUSBAND WAS AT HIS COUNTING HOUSE WHEN HE CAME HOME HIS WIFE SAID TO HIM CASSIM I KNOW YOU THINK YOURSELF RICH BUT ALI BABA IS INFINITELY RICHER THAN YOU HE DOES NOT COUNT HIS MONEY BUT MEASURES IT
8474-281187-0023 CASSIM DESIRED HER TO EXPLAIN THE RIDDLE WHICH SHE DID BY TELLING HIM THE STRATAGEM SHE HAD USED TO MAKE THE DISCOVERY AND SHOWED HIM THE PIECE OF MONEY WHICH WAS SO OLD THAT THEY COULD NOT TELL IN WHAT PRINCE'S REIGN IT WAS COINED
8474-281187-0024 AND WENT TO HIM IN THE MORNING BEFORE SUNRISE ALI BABA SAID HE I AM SURPRISED AT YOU YOU PRETEND TO BE MISERABLY POOR AND YET YOU MEASURE GOLD MY WIFE FOUND THIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MEASURE YOU BORROWED YESTERDAY BY THIS DISCOURSE
8474-281187-0025 ALI BABA PERCEIVED THAT CASSIM AND HIS WIFE THROUGH HIS OWN WIFE'S FOLLY KNEW WHAT THEY HAD SO MUCH REASON TO CONCEAL BUT WHAT WAS DONE COULD NOT BE UNDONE THEREFORE WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST SURPRISE OR TROUBLE HE CONFESSED ALL
8474-281187-0026 CASSIM ROSE THE NEXT MORNING LONG BEFORE THE SUN AND SET OUT FOR THE FOREST WITH TEN MULES BEARING GREAT CHESTS WHICH HE DESIGNED TO FILL AND FOLLOWED THE ROAD WHICH ALI BABA HAD POINTED OUT TO HIM IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE ROCK
8474-281187-0027 ON EXAMINING THE CAVE HE WAS IN GREAT ADMIRATION TO FIND MUCH MORE RICHES THAN HE HAD EXPECTED FROM ALI BABA'S RELATION HE QUICKLY LAID AS MANY BAGS OF GOLD AS HE COULD CARRY AT THE DOOR OF THE CAVERN BUT HIS THOUGHTS WERE SO FULL OF THE GREAT RICHES HE SHOULD POSSESS
8474-281187-0028 THAT HE COULD NOT THINK OF THE NECESSARY WORD TO MAKE IT OPEN AND INSTEAD OF SESAME SAID OPEN BARLEY AND WAS MUCH AMAZED TO FIND THAT THE DOOR REMAINED FAST SHUT HE NAMED SEVERAL SORTS OF GRAIN BUT STILL THE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN
8474-281187-0029 HE THREW DOWN THE BAGS HE HAD LOADED HIMSELF WITH AND WALKED DISTRACTEDLY UP AND DOWN THE CAVE WITHOUT HAVING THE LEAST REGARD TO THE RICHES THAT WERE ROUND HIM ABOUT NOON THE ROBBERS VISITED THEIR CAVE
8474-281187-0030 AND RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE EFFORT FOR HIS LIFE HE RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND NO SOONER SAW THE DOOR OPEN THAN HE RAN OUT AND THREW THE LEADER DOWN BUT COULD NOT ESCAPE THE OTHER ROBBERS WHO WITH THEIR CIMETERS SOON DEPRIVED HIM OF LIFE
8474-281187-0031 THE FIRST CARE OF THE ROBBERS AFTER THIS WAS TO EXAMINE THE CAVE THEY FOUND ALL THE BAGS WHICH CASSIM HAD BROUGHT TO THE DOOR TO BE READY TO LOAD HIS MULES AND CARRIED THEM AGAIN TO THEIR PLACES BUT THEY DID NOT MISS WHAT ALI BABA HAD TAKEN AWAY BEFORE
8474-281187-0032 THEN HOLDING A COUNCIL AND DELIBERATING UPON THIS OCCURRENCE THEY GUESSED THAT CASSIM WHEN HE WAS IN COULD NOT GET OUT AGAIN BUT COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW HE HAD LEARNED THE SECRET WORDS BY WHICH ALONE HE COULD ENTER THEY COULD NOT DENY THE FACT OF HIS BEING THERE
8474-281187-0033 AND TO TERRIFY ANY PERSON OR ACCOMPLICE WHO SHOULD ATTEMPT THE SAME THING THEY AGREED TO CUT CASSIM'S BODY INTO FOUR QUARTERS TO HANG TWO ON ONE SIDE AND TWO ON THE OTHER WITHIN THE DOOR OF THE CAVE
8474-281187-0034 AND WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING MORE TO DETAIN THEM LEFT THE PLACE OF THEIR HOARDS WELL CLOSED THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES WENT TO BEAT THE ROADS AGAIN AND TO ATTACK THE CARAVANS THEY MIGHT MEET IN THE MEANTIME CASSIM'S WIFE WAS VERY UNEASY WHEN NIGHT CAME
8474-281187-0035 AND HER HUSBAND WAS NOT RETURNED SHE RAN TO ALI BABA IN GREAT ALARM AND SAID I BELIEVE BROTHER IN LAW THAT YOU KNOW CASSIM IS GONE TO THE FOREST AND UPON WHAT ACCOUNT IT IS NOW NIGHT AND HE HAS NOT RETURNED I AM AFRAID SOME MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED TO HIM
