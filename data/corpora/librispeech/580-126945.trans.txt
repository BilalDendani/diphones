580-126945-0000 THIS BELIEF WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS GROUNDS THE PREPARATIONS OF BOTH THE COMBATANTS
580-126945-0001 IN THE LAST STATE OF PERFECTION AND HE COULD SEE THE REST OF THE HELLENIC RACE TAKING SIDES IN THE QUARREL THOSE WHO DELAYED DOING SO AT ONCE HAVING IT IN CONTEMPLATION INDEED THIS WAS THE GREATEST MOVEMENT YET KNOWN IN HISTORY
580-126945-0002 OF TIME BE CLEARLY ASCERTAINED YET THE EVIDENCES WHICH AN INQUIRY CARRIED AS FAR BACK AS WAS PRACTICABLE LEADS ME TO TRUST ALL POINT TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ON A GREAT SCALE
580-126945-0003 EITHER IN WAR OR IN OTHER MATTERS FOR INSTANCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED HELLAS HAD IN ANCIENT TIMES NO SETTLED POPULATION ON THE CONTRARY MIGRATIONS WERE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE
580-126945-0004 THE SEVERAL TRIBES READILY ABANDONING THEIR HOMES UNDER THE PRESSURE OF SUPERIOR NUMBERS WITHOUT COMMERCE WITHOUT FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION EITHER BY LAND OR SEA CULTIVATING NO MORE OF THEIR TERRITORY THAN THE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE REQUIRED
580-126945-0005 THEY CARED LITTLE FOR SHIFTING THEIR HABITATION AND CONSEQUENTLY NEITHER BUILT LARGE CITIES NOR ATTAINED TO ANY OTHER FORM OF GREATNESS THE RICHEST SOILS WERE ALWAYS MOST SUBJECT TO THIS CHANGE OF MASTERS SUCH AS THE DISTRICT NOW CALLED THESSALY BOEOTIA
580-126945-0006 MOST OF THE PELOPONNESE ARCADIA EXCEPTED AND THE MOST FERTILE PARTS OF THE REST OF HELLAS THE GOODNESS OF THE LAND FAVOURED THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS AND THUS CREATED FACTION WHICH PROVED A FERTILE SOURCE OF RUIN
580-126945-0007 IT ALSO INVITED INVASION ACCORDINGLY ATTICA FROM THE POVERTY OF ITS SOIL ENJOYING FROM A VERY REMOTE PERIOD FREEDOM FROM FACTION NEVER CHANGED ITS INHABITANTS
580-126945-0008 AND HERE IS NO INCONSIDERABLE EXEMPLIFICATION OF MY ASSERTION THAT THE MIGRATIONS WERE THE CAUSE OF THERE BEING NO CORRESPONDENT GROWTH IN OTHER PARTS THE MOST POWERFUL VICTIMS OF WAR OR FACTION
580-126945-0009 FROM THE REST OF HELLAS TOOK REFUGE WITH THE ATHENIANS AS A SAFE RETREAT AND AT AN EARLY PERIOD BECOMING NATURALIZED SWELLED THE ALREADY LARGE POPULATION OF THE CITY TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT ATTICA BECAME AT LAST TOO SMALL TO HOLD THEM
580-126945-0010 NOR INDEED OF THE UNIVERSAL PREVALENCE OF THE NAME ON THE CONTRARY BEFORE THE TIME OF HELLEN SON OF DEUCALION NO SUCH APPELLATION EXISTED BUT THE COUNTRY WENT BY THE NAMES OF THE DIFFERENT TRIBES
580-126945-0011 AND WERE INVITED AS ALLIES INTO THE OTHER CITIES THAT ONE BY ONE THEY GRADUALLY ACQUIRED FROM THE CONNECTION THE NAME OF HELLENES
580-126945-0012 BORN LONG AFTER THE TROJAN WAR HE NOWHERE CALLS ALL OF THEM BY THAT NAME NOR INDEED ANY OF THEM EXCEPT THE FOLLOWERS OF ACHILLES FROM PHTHIOTIS WHO WERE THE ORIGINAL HELLENES
580-126945-0013 IN HIS POEMS THEY ARE CALLED DANAANS ARGIVES AND ACHAEANS HE DOES NOT EVEN USE THE TERM BARBARIAN
580-126945-0014 BY ONE DISTINCTIVE APPELLATION IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT THE SEVERAL HELLENIC COMMUNITIES COMPRISING NOT ONLY THOSE WHO FIRST ACQUIRED THE NAME CITY BY CITY AS THEY CAME TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BUT ALSO THOSE WHO ASSUMED IT AFTERWARDS AS THE NAME OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE
580-126945-0015 WERE BEFORE THE TROJAN WAR PREVENTED BY THEIR WANT OF STRENGTH AND THE ABSENCE OF MUTUAL INTERCOURSE FROM DISPLAYING ANY COLLECTIVE ACTION INDEED THEY COULD NOT UNITE FOR THIS EXPEDITION TILL THEY HAD GAINED INCREASED FAMILIARITY WITH THE SEA
580-126945-0016 AND THE FIRST PERSON KNOWN TO US BY TRADITION AS HAVING ESTABLISHED A NAVY IS MINOS HE MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE HELLENIC SEA AND RULED OVER THE CYCLADES INTO MOST OF WHICH
580-126945-0017 AND THUS DID HIS BEST TO PUT DOWN PIRACY IN THOSE WATERS A NECESSARY STEP TO SECURE THE REVENUES FOR HIS OWN USE
580-126945-0018 AND EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY MANY OF HELLAS STILL FOLLOW THE OLD FASHION THE OZOLIAN
580-126945-0019 THE ACARNANIANS AND THAT REGION OF THE CONTINENT AND THE CUSTOM OF CARRYING ARMS IS STILL KEPT UP AMONG THESE CONTINENTALS FROM THE OLD PIRATICAL HABITS THE WHOLE OF HELLAS USED ONCE TO CARRY ARMS THEIR HABITATIONS BEING UNPROTECTED
580-126945-0020 AND TO ADOPT AN EASIER AND MORE LUXURIOUS MODE OF LIFE INDEED IT IS ONLY LATELY THAT THEIR RICH OLD MEN LEFT OFF THE LUXURY OF WEARING UNDERGARMENTS OF LINEN AND FASTENING A KNOT OF THEIR HAIR WITH A TIE OF GOLDEN GRASSHOPPERS
580-126945-0021 A FASHION WHICH SPREAD TO THEIR IONIAN KINDRED AND LONG PREVAILED AMONG THE OLD MEN THERE
580-126945-0022 MORE IN CONFORMITY WITH MODERN IDEAS WAS FIRST ADOPTED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS THE RICH DOING THEIR BEST TO ASSIMILATE THEIR WAY OF LIFE TO THAT OF THE COMMON PEOPLE THEY ALSO SET THE EXAMPLE OF CONTENDING NAKED
580-126945-0023 PUBLICLY STRIPPING AND ANOINTING THEMSELVES WITH OIL IN THEIR GYMNASTIC EXERCISES FORMERLY EVEN IN THE OLYMPIC CONTESTS THE ATHLETES WHO CONTENDED WORE BELTS ACROSS THEIR MIDDLES AND IT IS BUT A FEW YEARS SINCE THAT THE PRACTICE CEASED
580-126945-0024 TO THIS DAY AMONG SOME OF THE BARBARIANS ESPECIALLY IN ASIA WHEN PRIZES FOR BOXING AND WRESTLING ARE OFFERED BELTS ARE WORN BY THE COMBATANTS AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER POINTS IN WHICH A LIKENESS MIGHT BE SHOWN BETWEEN THE LIFE OF THE HELLENIC WORLD OF OLD AND THE BARBARIAN OF TO DAY
580-126945-0025 BUT THE OLD TOWNS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT PREVALENCE OF PIRACY WERE BUILT AWAY FROM THE SEA WHETHER ON THE ISLANDS OR THE CONTINENT AND STILL REMAIN IN THEIR OLD SITES FOR THE PIRATES USED TO PLUNDER ONE ANOTHER
580-126945-0026 AND INDEED ALL COAST POPULATIONS WHETHER SEAFARING OR NOT THE ISLANDERS TOO WERE GREAT PIRATES THESE ISLANDERS WERE CARIANS AND PHOENICIANS BY WHOM MOST OF THE ISLANDS WERE COLONIZED AS WAS PROVED BY THE FOLLOWING FACT
580-126945-0027 WERE CARIANS THEY WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE FASHION OF THE ARMS BURIED WITH THEM AND BY THE METHOD OF INTERMENT WHICH WAS THE SAME AS THE CARIANS STILL FOLLOW BUT AS SOON AS MINOS HAD FORMED HIS NAVY COMMUNICATION BY SEA BECAME EASIER
580-126945-0028 AS HE COLONIZED MOST OF THE ISLANDS AND THUS EXPELLED THE MALEFACTORS THE COAST POPULATION NOW BEGAN TO APPLY THEMSELVES MORE CLOSELY TO THE ACQUISITION OF WEALTH AND THEIR LIFE BECAME MORE SETTLED
580-126945-0029 SOME EVEN BEGAN TO BUILD THEMSELVES WALLS ON THE STRENGTH OF THEIR NEWLY ACQUIRED RICHES FOR THE LOVE OF GAIN WOULD RECONCILE THE WEAKER TO THE DOMINION OF THE STRONGER AND THE POSSESSION OF CAPITAL ENABLED THE MORE POWERFUL TO REDUCE THE SMALLER TOWNS TO SUBJECTION
580-126945-0030 AND IT WAS AT A SOMEWHAT LATER STAGE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT
580-126945-0031 WHAT ENABLED AGAMEMNON TO RAISE THE ARMAMENT WAS MORE IN MY OPINION HIS SUPERIORITY IN STRENGTH THAN THE OATHS OF TYNDAREUS WHICH BOUND THE SUITORS TO FOLLOW HIM
580-126945-0032 INDEED THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY THOSE PELOPONNESIANS WHO HAVE BEEN THE RECIPIENTS OF THE MOST CREDIBLE TRADITION IS THIS
580-126945-0033 PELOPS ARRIVING AMONG A NEEDY POPULATION FROM ASIA WITH VAST WEALTH ACQUIRED SUCH POWER THAT STRANGER THOUGH HE WAS THE COUNTRY WAS CALLED AFTER HIM AND THIS POWER FORTUNE SAW FIT MATERIALLY TO INCREASE IN THE HANDS OF HIS DESCENDANTS
580-126945-0034 AND TO THE HANDS OF HIS RELATION WHO HAD LEFT HIS FATHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF CHRYSIPPUS
580-126945-0035 WHEN HE SET OUT ON HIS EXPEDITION HAD COMMITTED MYCENAE AND THE GOVERNMENT AS TIME WENT ON AND EURYSTHEUS DID NOT RETURN
580-126945-0036 BESIDES HIS POWER SEEMED CONSIDERABLE AND HE HAD NOT NEGLECTED TO COURT THE FAVOUR OF THE POPULACE AND ASSUMED THE SCEPTRE OF MYCENAE
580-126945-0037 AND SO THE POWER OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PELOPS CAME TO BE GREATER THAN THAT OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS
580-126945-0038 AND THAT OF THE ARCADIANS WAS FURNISHED BY HIM THIS AT LEAST IS WHAT HOMER SAYS IF HIS TESTIMONY IS DEEMED SUFFICIENT BESIDES IN HIS ACCOUNT OF THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SCEPTRE
580-126945-0039 NOW AGAMEMNON'S WAS A CONTINENTAL POWER AND HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OF ANY EXCEPT THE ADJACENT ISLANDS AND THESE WOULD NOT BE MANY BUT THROUGH THE POSSESSION OF A FLEET
580-126945-0040 BUT NO EXACT OBSERVER WOULD THEREFORE FEEL JUSTIFIED IN REJECTING THE ESTIMATE GIVEN BY THE POETS AND BY TRADITION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ARMAMENT FOR I SUPPOSE IF LACEDAEMON WERE TO BECOME DESOLATE
580-126945-0041 AND THE TEMPLES AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS WERE LEFT THAT AS TIME WENT ON THERE WOULD BE A STRONG DISPOSITION WITH POSTERITY TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT HER FAME AS A TRUE EXPONENT OF HER POWER AND YET THEY OCCUPY TWO FIFTHS OF PELOPONNESE
580-126945-0042 AND LEAD THE WHOLE NOT TO SPEAK OF THEIR NUMEROUS ALLIES WITHOUT STILL AS THE CITY IS NEITHER BUILT IN A COMPACT FORM NOR ADORNED WITH MAGNIFICENT TEMPLES AND PUBLIC EDIFICES BUT COMPOSED OF VILLAGES AFTER THE OLD FASHION OF HELLAS
580-126945-0043 WHEREAS IF ATHENS WERE TO SUFFER THE SAME MISFORTUNE I SUPPOSE THAT ANY INFERENCE FROM THE APPEARANCE PRESENTED TO THE EYE
580-126945-0044 WE HAVE THEREFORE NO RIGHT TO BE SCEPTICAL NOR TO CONTENT OURSELVES WITH AN INSPECTION OF A TOWN TO THE EXCLUSION OF A CONSIDERATION OF ITS POWER BUT WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT THE ARMAMENT IN QUESTION SURPASSED ALL BEFORE IT
580-126945-0045 HE HAS REPRESENTED IT AS CONSISTING OF TWELVE HUNDRED VESSELS THE BOEOTIAN COMPLEMENT OF EACH SHIP BEING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEN
580-126945-0046 BY THIS I CONCEIVE HE MEANT TO CONVEY THE MAXIMUM AND THE MINIMUM COMPLEMENT AT ANY RATE HE DOES NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF ANY OTHERS IN HIS CATALOGUE OF THE SHIPS THAT THEY WERE ALL ROWERS
580-126945-0047 WHICH ALL THE MEN AT THE OAR ARE BOWMEN NOW IT IS IMPROBABLE THAT MANY SUPERNUMERARIES SAILED IF WE EXCEPT THE KINGS AND HIGH OFFICERS ESPECIALLY AS THEY HAD TO CROSS THE OPEN SEA WITH MUNITIONS OF WAR IN SHIPS
580-126945-0048 DURING THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR EVEN AFTER THE VICTORY THEY OBTAINED ON THEIR ARRIVAL AND A VICTORY THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OR THE FORTIFICATIONS OF THE NAVAL CAMP COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN BUILT THERE IS NO INDICATION OF THEIR WHOLE FORCE HAVING BEEN EMPLOYED ON THE CONTRARY
580-126945-0049 THEY SEEM TO HAVE TURNED TO CULTIVATION OF THE CHERSONESE AND TO PIRACY FROM WANT OF SUPPLIES THIS WAS WHAT REALLY ENABLED THE TROJANS TO KEEP THE FIELD FOR TEN YEARS AGAINST THEM THE DISPERSION OF THE ENEMY MAKING THEM ALWAYS A MATCH FOR THE DETACHMENT LEFT BEHIND
580-126945-0050 THEY WOULD HAVE EASILY DEFEATED THE TROJANS IN THE FIELD SINCE THEY COULD HOLD THEIR OWN AGAINST THEM WITH THE DIVISION ON SERVICE IN SHORT IF THEY HAD STUCK TO THE SIEGE
580-126945-0051 BUT AS WANT OF MONEY PROVED THE WEAKNESS OF EARLIER EXPEDITIONS SO FROM THE SAME CAUSE EVEN THE ONE IN QUESTION MORE FAMOUS THAN ITS PREDECESSORS MAY BE PRONOUNCED ON THE EVIDENCE OF WHAT IT EFFECTED TO HAVE BEEN INFERIOR TO ITS RENOWN
580-126945-0052 EVEN AFTER THE TROJAN WAR HELLAS WAS STILL ENGAGED IN REMOVING AND SETTLING AND THUS COULD NOT ATTAIN TO THE QUIET WHICH MUST PRECEDE GROWTH THE LATE RETURN OF THE HELLENES FROM ILIUM CAUSED MANY REVOLUTIONS
580-126945-0053 SO THAT MUCH HAD TO BE DONE AND MANY YEARS HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE HELLAS COULD ATTAIN TO A DURABLE TRANQUILLITY UNDISTURBED BY REMOVALS AND COULD BEGIN TO SEND OUT COLONIES AS ATHENS DID TO IONIA AND MOST OF THE ISLANDS
580-126945-0054 AND THE PELOPONNESIANS TO MOST OF ITALY AND SICILY AND SOME PLACES IN THE REST OF HELLAS ALL THESE PLACES WERE FOUNDED SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE WAR WITH TROY BUT AS THE POWER OF HELLAS GREW AND THE ACQUISITION OF WEALTH BECAME MORE AN OBJECT
580-126945-0055 THE REVENUES OF THE STATES INCREASING TYRANNIES WERE BY THEIR MEANS ESTABLISHED ALMOST EVERYWHERE THE OLD FORM OF GOVERNMENT BEING HEREDITARY MONARCHY WITH DEFINITE PREROGATIVES
580-126945-0056 AND HELLAS BEGAN TO FIT OUT FLEETS AND APPLY HERSELF MORE CLOSELY TO THE SEA IT IS SAID THAT THE CORINTHIANS WERE THE FIRST TO APPROACH THE MODERN STYLE OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE AND THAT CORINTH WAS THE FIRST PLACE IN HELLAS WHERE GALLEYS WERE BUILT
580-126945-0057 AND WE HAVE AMEINOCLES A CORINTHIAN SHIPWRIGHT MAKING FOUR SHIPS FOR THE SAMIANS DATING FROM THE END OF THIS WAR IT IS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
580-126945-0058 AGAIN THE EARLIEST SEA FIGHT IN HISTORY WAS BETWEEN THE CORINTHIANS AND CORCYRAEANS
580-126945-0059 DATING FROM THE SAME TIME PLANTED ON AN ISTHMUS CORINTH HAD FROM TIME OUT OF MIND BEEN A COMMERCIAL EMPORIUM AS FORMERLY ALMOST ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HELLENES WITHIN AND WITHOUT PELOPONNESE WAS CARRIED ON OVERLAND
580-126945-0060 AND THE CORINTHIAN TERRITORY WAS THE HIGHWAY THROUGH WHICH IT TRAVELLED SHE HAD CONSEQUENTLY GREAT MONEY RESOURCES AS IS SHOWN BY THE EPITHET WEALTHY BESTOWED BY THE OLD POETS ON THE PLACE AND THIS ENABLED HER WHEN TRAFFIC BY SEA BECAME MORE COMMON
580-126945-0061 TO PROCURE HER NAVY AND PUT DOWN PIRACY AND AS SHE COULD OFFER A MART FOR BOTH BRANCHES OF THE TRADE SHE ACQUIRED FOR HERSELF ALL THE POWER WHICH A LARGE REVENUE AFFORDS
580-126945-0062 SUBSEQUENTLY THE IONIANS ATTAINED TO GREAT NAVAL STRENGTH IN THE REIGN OF CYRUS THE FIRST KING OF THE PERSIANS AND OF HIS SON CAMBYSES
580-126945-0063 SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PRINCIPALLY COMPOSED OF THE OLD FIFTY OARS AND LONG BOATS
580-126945-0064 IT WAS QUITE AT THE END OF THIS PERIOD THAT THE WAR WITH AEGINA AND THE PROSPECT OF THE BARBARIAN INVASION ENABLED THEMISTOCLES TO PERSUADE THE ATHENIANS TO BUILD THE FLEET WITH WHICH THEY FOUGHT AT SALAMIS
580-126945-0065 THEY WERE THE MEANS BY WHICH THE ISLANDS WERE REACHED AND REDUCED THOSE OF THE SMALLEST AREA FALLING THE EASIEST PREY WARS BY LAND THERE WERE NONE NONE AT LEAST BY WHICH POWER WAS ACQUIRED
580-126945-0066 VARIOUS TOO WERE THE OBSTACLES WHICH THE NATIONAL GROWTH ENCOUNTERED IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES THE POWER OF THE IONIANS WAS ADVANCING WITH RAPID STRIDES WHEN IT CAME INTO COLLISION WITH PERSIA UNDER KING CYRUS WHO AFTER HAVING DETHRONED CROESUS
580-126945-0067 AGAIN WHEREVER THERE WERE TYRANTS THEIR HABIT OF PROVIDING SIMPLY FOR THEMSELVES OF LOOKING SOLELY TO THEIR PERSONAL COMFORT AND FAMILY AGGRANDIZEMENT MADE SAFETY THE GREAT AIM OF THEIR POLICY AND PREVENTED ANYTHING GREAT PROCEEDING FROM THEM
580-126945-0068 OR OF ANY VIGOROUS ACTION OF THEIR OWN BUT AT LAST A TIME CAME WHEN THE TYRANTS OF ATHENS AND THE FAR OLDER TYRANNIES OF THE REST OF HELLAS WERE
580-126945-0069 ONCE AND FOR ALL PUT DOWN BY LACEDAEMON FOR THIS CITY THOUGH AFTER THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DORIANS ITS PRESENT INHABITANTS IT SUFFERED FROM FACTIONS FOR AN UNPARALLELED LENGTH OF TIME STILL AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD OBTAINED GOOD LAWS
580-126945-0070 AND ENJOYED A FREEDOM FROM TYRANTS WHICH WAS UNBROKEN IT HAS POSSESSED THE SAME FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS RECKONING TO THE END OF THE LATE WAR AND HAS THUS BEEN IN A POSITION TO ARRANGE THE AFFAIRS OF THE OTHER STATES
580-126945-0071 NOT MANY YEARS AFTER THE DEPOSITION OF THE TYRANTS THE BATTLE OF MARATHON WAS FOUGHT BETWEEN THE MEDES AND THE ATHENIANS TEN YEARS AFTERWARDS THE BARBARIAN RETURNED WITH THE ARMADA FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF HELLAS
580-126945-0072 IN THE FACE OF THIS GREAT DANGER THE COMMAND OF THE CONFEDERATE HELLENES WAS ASSUMED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS IN VIRTUE OF THEIR SUPERIOR POWER AND THE ATHENIANS HAVING MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO ABANDON THEIR CITY BROKE UP THEIR HOMES
580-126945-0073 THREW THEMSELVES INTO THEIR SHIPS AND BECAME A NAVAL PEOPLE THIS COALITION AFTER REPULSING THE BARBARIAN SOON AFTERWARDS SPLIT INTO TWO SECTIONS WHICH INCLUDED THE HELLENES WHO HAD REVOLTED FROM THE KING AS WELL AS THOSE WHO HAD AIDED HIM IN THE WAR
580-126945-0074 OR WITH ITS OWN REVOLTED ALLIES AND CONSEQUENTLY AFFORDED THEM CONSTANT PRACTICE IN MILITARY MATTERS AND THAT EXPERIENCE WHICH IS LEARNT IN THE SCHOOL OF DANGER
580-126945-0075 AND IMPOSED INSTEAD CONTRIBUTIONS IN MONEY ON ALL EXCEPT CHIOS AND LESBOS BOTH FOUND THEIR RESOURCES FOR THIS WAR SEPARATELY TO EXCEED THE SUM OF THEIR STRENGTH WHEN THE ALLIANCE FLOURISHED INTACT
580-126945-0076 HAVING NOW GIVEN THE RESULT OF MY INQUIRIES INTO EARLY TIMES I GRANT THAT THERE WILL BE A DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING EVERY PARTICULAR DETAIL THE WAY THAT MOST MEN DEAL WITH TRADITIONS EVEN TRADITIONS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY
580-126945-0077 PISISTRATUS WAS REALLY SUPREME
580-126945-0078 YET NOT LIKING TO BE APPREHENDED AND RISK THEIR LIVES FOR NOTHING FELL UPON HIPPARCHUS NEAR THE TEMPLE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF LEOS
580-126945-0079 WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN OBSCURED BY TIME FOR INSTANCE
580-126945-0080 KINGS HAVE TWO VOTES EACH THE FACT BEING THAT THEY HAVE ONLY ONE
580-126945-0081 SO LITTLE PAINS DO THE VULGAR TAKE IN THE INVESTIGATION OF TRUTH ACCEPTING READILY THE FIRST STORY THAT COMES TO HAND ON THE WHOLE HOWEVER THE CONCLUSIONS I HAVE DRAWN FROM THE PROOFS QUOTED MAY I BELIEVE SAFELY BE RELIED ON
580-126945-0082 TO COME TO THIS WAR DESPITE THE KNOWN DISPOSITION OF THE ACTORS IN A STRUGGLE TO OVERRATE ITS IMPORTANCE
580-126945-0083 SO MY HABIT HAS BEEN TO MAKE THE SPEAKERS SAY WHAT WAS IN MY OPINION DEMANDED OF THEM BY THE VARIOUS OCCASIONS OF COURSE ADHERING AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THE GENERAL SENSE OF WHAT THEY REALLY SAID AND WITH REFERENCE TO THE NARRATIVE OF EVENTS
580-126945-0084 FAR FROM PERMITTING MYSELF TO DERIVE IT FROM THE FIRST SOURCE THAT CAME TO HAND I DID NOT EVEN TRUST MY OWN IMPRESSIONS BUT IT RESTS PARTLY ON WHAT I SAW MYSELF PARTLY ON WHAT OTHERS SAW FOR ME THE ACCURACY OF THE REPORT BEING ALWAYS TRIED BY THE MOST SEVERE AND DETAILED TESTS POSSIBLE
580-126945-0085 IN FINE I HAVE WRITTEN MY WORK NOT AS AN ESSAY WHICH IS TO WIN THE APPLAUSE OF THE MOMENT BUT AS A POSSESSION FOR ALL TIME THE MEDIAN WAR THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF PAST TIMES YET FOUND A SPEEDY DECISION IN TWO ACTIONS BY SEA AND TWO BY LAND
580-126945-0086 HERE BY THE PARTIES CONTENDING THE OLD INHABITANTS BEING SOMETIMES REMOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR OTHERS NEVER WAS THERE SO MUCH BANISHING AND BLOOD SHEDDING NOW ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE NOW IN THE STRIFE OF FACTION
580-126945-0087 THERE WERE GREAT DROUGHTS IN SUNDRY PLACES AND CONSEQUENT FAMINES AND THAT MOST CALAMITOUS AND AWFULLY FATAL VISITATION THE PLAGUE ALL THIS CAME UPON THEM WITH THE LATE WAR WHICH WAS BEGUN BY THE ATHENIANS AND PELOPONNESIANS
580-126945-0088 TO THE QUESTION WHY THEY BROKE THE TREATY I ANSWER BY PLACING FIRST AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR GROUNDS OF COMPLAINT AND POINTS OF DIFFERENCE THAT NO ONE MAY EVER HAVE TO ASK THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE WHICH PLUNGED THE HELLENES INTO A WAR OF SUCH MAGNITUDE
