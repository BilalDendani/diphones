8536-244441-0000 AND FINDING AN ABUNDANCE OF FALLEN WOOD ALONG THE BEACH THEY PULLED IT INTO A HEAP AND KINDLED A FIRE THE NIGHT AS USUAL WAS COOL BUT THE PLEASANT FLAMES DISPELLED THE CHILL
8536-244441-0001 AND THE COVE WAS VERY SNUG AND COMFORTABLE AFTER A DAY OF HARD AND CONTINUOUS WORK JARVIS AND IKE DID THE COOKING AT WHICH THEY WERE ADEPTS AFTER PULLIN A BOAT TEN OR TWELVE HOURS

8536-244441-0004 JARVIS TOOK A SMALL FLAT SKILLET FROM THE BOAT AND FRIED THE CORN CAKES HARRY FRIED BACON AND STRIPS OF DRIED BEEF IN ANOTHER THE HOMELY TASK IN GOOD COMPANY
8536-244441-0005 WAS MOST GRATEFUL TO HIM HIS FACE REFLECTED HIS PLEASURE PROVIDIN IT DON'T RAIN ON YOU
8536-244441-0006 SAID JARVIS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A GENUINE APPETITE IS UNTIL YOU LIVE UNDER THE BLUE SKY BY DAY
8536-244441-0007 HARRY YOU'LL FIND THREE TIN PLATES IN THE LOCKER IN THE BOAT FETCH EM HARRY ABANDONED HIS SKILLET FOR A MOMENT AND BROUGHT THE PLATES IKE THE COFFEE NOW BEING ABOUT READY
8536-244441-0008 PRODUCED THREE TIN CUPS AND WITH THESE SIMPLE PREPARATIONS THEY BEGAN THEIR SUPPER THE FLAMES WENT DOWN AND THE FIRE BECAME A GREAT BED OF COALS GLOWING IN THE DARKNESS
8536-244441-0009 AND MAKING A CIRCLE OF LIGHT THE EDGES OF WHICH TOUCHED THE BOAT HARRY FOUND THAT JARVIS WAS TELLING THE TRUTH THE LONG WORK AND THE COOL NIGHT AIR WITHOUT A ROOF ABOVE HIM
8536-244441-0010 GAVE HIM A HUNGER THE LIKE OF WHICH HE HAD NOT KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME HE ATE CAKE AFTER CAKE OF THE CORN BREAD AND PIECE AFTER PIECE OF THE MEAT JARVIS AND IKE
8536-244441-0011 KEPT HIM FULL COMPANY DIDN'T I TELL YOU IT WAS FINE SAID JARVIS STRETCHING HIS LONG LENGTH AND SIGHING WITH CONTENT I FEEL SO GOOD THAT I'M NEAR BUSTIN INTO SONG

8536-244441-0014 THE NOTES OF THE OLD MELODY SWELLED AND AS BEFORE THE DEEP CHANNEL OF THE RIVER GAVE THEM BACK AGAIN IN FAINT AND DYING ECHOES TIME AND PLACE
8536-244441-0015 AND THE VOICE OF JARVIS WITH ITS HAUNTING QUALITY THREW A SPELL OVER HARRY THE PRESENT ROLLED AWAY HE WAS BACK IN THE ROMANTIC OLD PAST OF WHICH HE HAD READ SO MUCH
8536-244441-0016 AND KENTON AND HARROD AND THE OTHER GREAT FOREST RANGERS THE DARKNESS SANK DOWN DEEPER AND HEAVIER THE STARS CAME OUT PRESENTLY AND TWINKLED IN THE BLUE
8536-244441-0017 YET IT WAS STILL DIM IN THE GORGE SAVE WHERE THE GLOWING BED OF COALS CAST A CIRCLE OF LIGHT THE KENTUCKY SHOWING A FAINT TINGE OF BLUE FLOWED WITH A SOFT MURMUR
8536-244441-0018 HARRY AND IKE WERE LYING ON THE GRASS PROPPED EACH ON ONE ELBOW WHILE JARVIS SITTING WITH HIS BACK AGAINST A SMALL TREE WAS STILL SINGING WHEN IN THY DREAMING

8536-244441-0020 NITA JUANITA LET ME LINGER BY THY SIDE NITA JUANITA BE THOU MY OWN FAIR BRIDE THE SONG CEASED AND THE MURMUR OF THE RIVER CAME MORE CLEARLY
8536-244441-0021 HARRY WAS DRAWN DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD DIM PAST LYING THERE IN THE GORGE WITH ONLY THE RIVER TO BE SEEN THE WILDERNESS CAME BACK AND THE WHOLE LAND
8536-244441-0022 WAS CLOTHED WITH THE MIGHTY FORESTS HE BROUGHT HIMSELF BACK WITH AN EFFORT WHEN HE SAW JARVIS LOOKING AT HIM AND SMILING TAIN'T SO BAD DOWN HERE ON A SPRING NIGHT IS IT HARRY HE SAID
8536-244441-0023 AS I SAID THAT IT DON'T RAIN WHERE DID YOU GET THAT SONG SAM ASKED HARRY THEY HAD ALREADY FALLEN INTO THE EASY HABIT OF CALLING ONE ANOTHER BY THEIR FIRST NAMES

8536-244441-0032 NOW FELLERS WE'LL PUT OUT THE FIRE AN ROLL IN OUR BLANKETS I GUESS WE DON'T NEED TO KEEP ANY WATCH HERE HARRY WAS SOON IN A DREAMLESS SLEEP
8536-244441-0033 HE SAT UP IN HIS BLANKETS AND LOOKED AROUND A MERE MASS OF BLACK COALS SHOWED WHERE THE FIRE HAD BEEN AND TWO LONG DARK OBJECTS LOOKING LIKE LOGS IN THE DIM LIGHT WERE HIS COMRADES
8536-244441-0034 HE CAST THE BLANKETS ASIDE ENTIRELY AND WALKED A LITTLE DISTANCE UP THE STREAM THE INSTINCT THAT HAD AWAKENED HIM WAS RIGHT HE HEARD VOICES AND SAW A LIGHT
8536-244441-0035 THEN HE REMEMBERED THE ROPE FERRY
8536-244441-0036 THAT SOME ONE WAS CROSSING ALTHOUGH IT WAS MIDNIGHT AND PAST HE WENT BACK AND TOUCHED JARVIS LIGHTLY ON THE SHOULDER THE MOUNTAINEER AWOKE INSTANTLY AND SAT UP ALL HIS FACULTIES ALERT
8536-244441-0037 WHAT IS IT HE ASKED IN A WHISPER PEOPLE CROSSING THE RIVER AT THE FERRY ABOVE HARRY WHISPERED BACK
8536-244441-0038 LIKE AS NOT THEY'RE SOLDIERS IN THIS WAR
8536-244441-0039 WHEN THEY COULD HAVE A LOT MORE FUN AT HOME JEST LET IKE SLEEP ON HE'S MY SISTER'S SON BUT I DON'T B'LIEVE ANYBODY WOULD EVER THINK OF KIDNAPPIN HIM
8536-244441-0040 WHICH CROSSED THE RIVER AT A POINT WHERE THE HILLS ON EITHER SIDE DIPPED LOW AS THEY DREW NEAR THEY HEARD MANY VOICES AND THE LIGHTS INCREASED TO A DOZEN JARVIS'S BELIEF
8536-244441-0041 THAT IT WAS NO PARTY OF ORDINARY TRAVELERS SEEMED CORRECT LET'S GO A LITTLE NEARER THE BUSHES WILL STILL HIDE US WHISPERED THE MOUNTAINEER TO THE BOY
8536-244441-0042 BUT I GUESS WE'D BETTER KEEP OUT O THEIR BUSINESS THOUGH MY INQUIRIN TURN O MIND MAKES ME ANXIOUS TO SEE JUST WHO THEY ARE THEY WALKED TO THE END OF THE STRETCH OF BUSHES AND
8536-244441-0043 WHILE YET IN SHELTER COULD SEE CLEARLY ALL THAT WAS GOING ON ESPECIALLY AS THERE WAS NO EFFORT AT CONCEALMENT ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO WERE CROSSING THE STREAM THEY NUMBERED AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED MEN
8536-244441-0044 AND ALL HAD ARMS AND HORSES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE DISMOUNTED NOW AND THE HORSES ACCOMPANIED BY SMALL GUARDS WERE BEING CARRIED OVER THE RIVER FIRST EVIDENTLY THE MEN UNDERSTOOD THEIR WORK
8536-244441-0045 AS IT WAS BEING DONE RAPIDLY AND WITHOUT MUCH NOISE HARRY'S ATTENTION WAS SOON CONCENTRATED ON THREE MEN WHO STOOD NEAR THE EDGE OF THE BUSHES NOT MORE THAN THIRTY FEET AWAY
8536-244441-0046 THEY WORE SLOUCH HATS AND WERE WRAPPED IN HEAVY DARK CLOAKS
8536-244441-0047 WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM AND ALTHOUGH THEY SEEMED TO BE TAKING NO PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CROSSING THEY WATCHED EVERYTHING INTENTLY TWO OF THEM WERE VERY TALL BUT THE THIRD WAS SHORTER AND SLENDER
8536-244441-0048 THE MOON BRIGHTENED PRESENTLY AND SOME MOVEMENT AT THE FERRY CAUSED THE THREE MEN TO TURN
8536-244441-0049 I GUESS YOU KNOW EM HARRY HE SAID YES REPLIED THE BOY SEE THE ONE IN THE CENTER WITH THE DROOPING MUSTACHES AND THE SPLENDID FIGURE PEOPLE HAVE CALLED HIM THE HANDSOMEST MAN
8536-244441-0050 IN THE UNITED STATES HE WAS A GUEST AT MY FATHER'S HOUSE LAST YEAR WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY IT IS THE MAN WHO RECEIVED MORE POPULAR VOTES THAN LINCOLN BUT FEWER IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
8536-244441-0051 BRECKINRIDGE YES JOHN C BRECKINRIDGE WHY HE'S YOUNGER THAN I EXPECTED HE DON'T LOOK MORE'N FORTY JUST ABOUT FORTY I SHOULD SAY
8536-244441-0052 THE OTHER TALL MAN IS NAMED MORGAN JOHN H MORGAN I SAW HIM IN LEXINGTON ONCE HE'S A GREAT HORSEMAN THE THIRD THE SLENDER MAN WHO LOOKS AS IF HE WERE ALL FIRE IS NAMED DUKE
8536-244441-0053 I THINK THAT HE AND MORGAN ARE RELATED I FANCY THEY ARE GOING SOUTH OR MAYBE TO VIRGINIA HARRY THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE YES SAM THEY ARE MY PEOPLE
8536-244441-0054 THE MOUNTAINEER
8536-244441-0055 AND HESITATED BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT THEN HE SPOKE IN A DECIDED WHISPER SINCE THEY ARE YOUR PEOPLE AN ARE GOIN ON THE SAME BUSINESS THAT YOU ARE
8536-244441-0056 NOW IS YOUR TIME TO JOIN EM STEAD O WORKIN YOUR WAY CROSS THE HILLS WITH TWO IGNORANT MOUNTAINEERS
8536-244441-0057 MY NEPHEW NO SAM I'LL CONFESS TO YOU THAT IT'S A TEMPTATION BUT IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING WHERE I MEAN TO GO AND WHERE I SHOULD GO I'M GOING TO KEEP ON WITH YOU
8536-244441-0058 UNLESS YOU AND IKE THROW ME OUT OF THE BOAT WELL SPOKE BOY SAID JARVIS HE DID NOT TELL HARRY THAT COLONEL KENTON
8536-244441-0059 UNTIL HE SHOULD LEAVE HIM IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THAT HE HAD GIVEN HIM HIS SACRED PROMISE HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT A POWERFUL PULL THE SIGHT OF BRECKINRIDGE MORGAN AND DUKE HAD GIVEN TO HARRY AND HE KNEW
8536-244441-0060 THAT IF THE BOY WERE RESOLVED TO GO WITH THEM HE COULD NOT STOP HIM ALL THE HORSES WERE NOW ACROSS THE THREE LEADERS TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE BOAT REACHED THE FARTHER SHORE
8536-244441-0061 AND THE WHOLE COMPANY RODE AWAY IN THE DARKNESS DESPITE HIS RESOLUTION HARRY FELT A PANG WHEN THE LAST FIGURE DISAPPEARED OUR CURIOSITY BEIN GRATIFIED I THINK WE'D BETTER GO BACK TO SLEEP
8536-244441-0062 FAREWELL FAREWELL WE'RE SEEIN EM GOIN SOUTH HARRY I DREAM AHEAD SOMETIMES AN I DREAM WITH MY EYES OPEN
8536-244441-0063 TREADIN ON DEAD MEN THOSE ARE GOOD MEN BRAVE AND GENEROUS OH I DON'T MEAN THEM IN PARTICKLER
8536-244441-0064 THEM THAT SAY NOTHIN
8536-244441-0065 AN DON'T NEVER MAKE FOOLS O THEIRSELVES IT'S TIME WE WAS BACK IN OUR BLANKETS SLEEPIN SOUND CAUSE WE'VE GOT ANOTHER LONG DAY O HARD ROWIN BEFORE US IKE HAD NOT AWAKENED
8536-244441-0066 AND JARVIS AND HARRY WERE SOON ASLEEP AGAIN BUT THEY WERE UP AT DAWN AND AFTER A BRIEF BREAKFAST RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY ON THE RIVER GOING AT A GOOD PACE TOWARD THE SOUTHEAST
8536-244441-0067 THEY WERE HAILED TWO OR THREE TIMES FROM THE BANK BY ARMED MEN WHETHER OF THE NORTH OR SOUTH HARRY COULD NOT TELL BUT WHEN THEY REVEALED THEMSELVES AS MERE MOUNTAINEERS ON THEIR WAY BACK HAVING SOLD A RAFT
8536-244441-0068 THEY WERE PERMITTED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE LAST SUCH STOP JARVIS REMARKED RATHER GRIMLY THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE THREE GOOD RIFLES IN THIS BOAT
8536-244441-0069 BACKED BY FIVE OR SIX PISTOLS AN THAT AT LEAST TWO OF US MEANIN ME AND IKE ARE BOUT THE BEST SHOTS THAT EVER COME OUT O THE MOUNTAINS BUT HIS GOOD NATURE SOON RETURNED HE WAS NOT A MAN WHO COULD RETAIN ANGER LONG
8536-244441-0070 AND BEFORE NIGHT HE WAS SINGING AGAIN AS I STRAYED FROM MY COT AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY TO MUSE ON THE BEAUTIES OF JUNE NEATH A JESSAMINE SHADE
8536-244441-0071 AND SHE SADLY COMPLAINED TO THE MOON BUT IT'S NOT JUNE SAM
8536-244441-0072 THAT IS IF THEM CLOUDS STRAIGHT AHEAD DON'T CONCLUDE TO J'IN AN MAKE A FUSS THE CLOUDS DID JOIN AND THEY MADE QUITE A FUSS POURING OUT A GREAT QUANTITY OF RAIN
8536-244441-0073 WHICH A RISING WIND WHIPPED ABOUT SHARPLY BUT JARVIS FIRST STEERED THE BOAT UNDER THE EDGE OF A HIGH BANK WHERE IT WAS PROTECTED PARTLY AND THEY STRETCHED THE STRONG CANVAS BEFORE THE FIRST DROPS OF RAIN FELL
8536-244441-0074 IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THE THREE AND ALL THEIR SUPPLIES DRY AND HARRY WATCHED THE STORM BEAT SULLEN THUNDER ROLLED UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST
8536-244441-0075 AND THE SKIES WERE CUT DOWN THE CENTER BY BURNING STROKES OF LIGHTNING THE WIND WHIPPED THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER INTO WHITE FOAMY WAVES BUT HARRY HEARD AND BEHELD IT ALL WITH A CERTAIN PLEASURE
8536-244441-0076 IT WAS GOOD TO SEE THE STORM SEEK THEM AND YET NOT FIND THEM BEHIND THEIR CANVAS COVER HE REMAINED CLOSE IN HIS PLACE AND STARED OUT AT THE FOAMING SURFACE OF THE WATER BACK
8536-244441-0077 WENT HIS THOUGHTS AGAIN TO THE FAR OFF TROUBLED TIME WHEN THE HUNTER IN THE VAST WILDERNESS DEPENDED FOR HIS LIFE ON THE QUICKNESS OF EYE AND EAR HE HAD READ SO MUCH OF BOONE AND KENTON
8536-244441-0078 AND HARROD AND HIS OWN GREAT ANCESTOR AND THE IMPRESSION WAS SO VIVID THAT THE VISION WAS TRANSLATED INTO FACT
8536-244441-0079 SAID JARVIS WHO GLANCING AT HIM HAD READ HIS MIND WITH ALMOST UNCANNY INTUITION TIMES LIKE THESE THE INJUNS AN THE WILD ANIMALS ALL COME BACK
8536-244441-0080 WAY UP IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE NOTHIN OF THE OLD DAYS IS GONE CEPT THE INJUNS IKE I GUESS IT'S COLD GRUB FOR US TONIGHT
8536-244441-0081 IN ALL THIS RAIN REACH INTO THAT LOCKER AN BRING OUT THE MEAT AN BREAD THIS AIN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL WE'RE SNUG AN DRY
8536-244441-0082 SO LET THE STORM HOWL THEY BORE HIM AWAY WHEN THE DAY HAD FLED AND THE STORM WAS ROLLING HIGH AND THEY LAID HIM DOWN IN HIS LONELY BED
8536-244441-0083 THE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND THE WILD SEA LASHED THE SHORE WITH ITS FOAMING WAVE AND THE THUNDER PASSED ON THE RUSHING BLAST AS IT HOWLED O'ER THE ROVER'S GRAVE
8536-244441-0084 THE FULL TENOR ROSE AND SWELLED ABOVE THE SWEEP OF WIND AND RAIN AND THE MAN'S SOUL WAS IN THE WORDS HE SANG A GREAT VOICE WITH THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF STORM THE WATER BEFORE THEM
8536-244441-0085 THE LIGHTNING BLAZING AT INTERVALS AND THE THUNDER ROLLING IN A SUBLIME REFRAIN MOVED HARRY TO HIS INMOST SOUL THE SONG CEASED BUT ITS ECHO
8536-244441-0086 WAS LONG IN DYING ON THE RIVER DID YOU PICK UP THAT TOO FROM A WANDERING FIDDLER ASKED HARRY NO I DON'T KNOW WHERE I GOT IT
8536-244441-0087 I AIN'T EVER SEEN THE SEA HARRY BUT IT MUST BE A MIGHTY SIGHT PARTICKLARLY
8536-244441-0088 VERY LIKELY YOU'D BE SEASICK IF YOU WERE ON IT THEN I LIKE IT BEST WHEN THE WAVES ARE NOT RUNNING THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING CEASED AFTER A WHILE
8536-244441-0089 BUT THE RAIN CAME WITH A STEADY DRIVING RUSH THE NIGHT HAD NOW SETTLED DOWN THICK AND DARK AND AS THE BANKS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WERE VERY HIGH HARRY FELT AS IF THEY WERE IN A BLACK CANYON
8536-244441-0090 HE COULD SEE BUT DIMLY THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER ALL ELSE WAS LOST IN THE HEAVY GLOOM BUT THE BOAT HAD BEEN BUILT SO WELL AND THE CANVAS COVER WAS SO TAUT AND TIGHT THAT NOT A DROP ENTERED
8536-244441-0091 HIS SENSE OF COMFORT INCREASED AND THE REGULAR EVEN MUSICAL THRESH OF THE RAIN PROMOTED SLEEP WE WON'T BE WAKED UP TONIGHT BY PEOPLE CROSSIN THE RIVER THAT'S SHORE SAID JARVIS
8536-244441-0092 PEOPLE WOULDN'T USE THAT CROSSIN NOHOW ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS SO BOYS
8536-244441-0093 AN IF YOU DON'T HURRY I'LL BEAT YOU TO THAT HAPPY LAND THE THREE WERE OFF TO THE REALMS OF SLUMBER WITHIN TEN MINUTES RUNNING A RACE ABOUT EQUAL THE RAIN POURED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
8536-244441-0094 BUT THEY DID NOT AWAKE UNTIL THE YOUNG SUN SENT THE FIRST BEAMS OF DAY INTO THE GORGE THEN JARVIS SAT UP HE HAD THE FACULTY OF AWAKENING ALL AT ONCE
