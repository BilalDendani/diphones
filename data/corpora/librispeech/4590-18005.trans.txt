4590-18005-0000 THE DEATH OF THE SECOND MAN EATER
4590-18005-0001 CLIMBING UP THE STEPS OF HIS BUNGALOW AND PROWLING ROUND THE VERANDAH THE INSPECTOR HEARING THE NOISE AND THINKING IT WAS A DRUNKEN COOLIE SHOUTED ANGRILY GO AWAY BUT FORTUNATELY FOR HIM DID NOT ATTEMPT TO COME OUT OR TO OPEN THE DOOR
4590-18005-0002 THUS DISAPPOINTED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A MEAL OF HUMAN FLESH THE LION SEIZED A COUPLE OF THE INSPECTOR'S GOATS AND DEVOURED THEM THERE AND THEN ON HEARING OF THIS OCCURRENCE I DETERMINED TO SIT UP THE NEXT NIGHT NEAR THE INSPECTOR'S BUNGALOW
4590-18005-0003 FORTUNATELY THERE WAS A VACANT IRON SHANTY CLOSE AT HAND WITH A CONVENIENT LOOPHOLE IN IT FOR FIRING FROM AND OUTSIDE THIS I PLACED THREE FULL GROWN GOATS AS BAIT
4590-18005-0004 THE SAME TIME DRAGGING AWAY THE OTHERS RAIL AND ALL I FIRED SEVERAL SHOTS IN HIS DIRECTION
4590-18005-0005 SO I ONLY SUCCEEDED IN HITTING ONE OF THE GOATS I OFTEN LONGED FOR A FLASH LIGHT ON SUCH OCCASIONS NEXT MORNING I STARTED OFF IN PURSUIT AND WAS JOINED BY SOME OTHERS FROM THE CAMP I FOUND THAT THE TRAIL OF THE GOATS AND RAIL WAS EASILY FOLLOWED
4590-18005-0006 AND WE SOON CAME UP ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY TO WHERE THE LION WAS STILL BUSY AT HIS MEAL HE WAS CONCEALED IN SOME THICK BUSH AND GROWLED ANGRILY ON HEARING OUR APPROACH FINALLY AS WE GOT CLOSER HE SUDDENLY MADE A CHARGE
4590-18005-0007 RUSHING THROUGH THE BUSHES AT A GREAT PACE IN AN INSTANT EVERY MAN OF THE PARTY SCRAMBLED HASTILY UP THE NEAREST TREE
4590-18005-0008 WHO STOOD STEADILY BY ME THROUGHOUT
4590-18005-0009 WHERE WE HAD LAST SEEN HIM WE GUESSED BY THE SILENCE THAT HE HAD SLUNK OFF WE THEREFORE ADVANCED CAUTIOUSLY AND ON GETTING UP TO THE PLACE
4590-18005-0010 THINKING THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY THE LION WOULD RETURN AS USUAL TO FINISH HIS MEAL I HAD A VERY STRONG SCAFFOLDING PUT UP A FEW FEET AWAY FROM THE DEAD GOATS AND TOOK UP MY POSITION ON IT BEFORE DARK ON THIS OCCASION I BROUGHT MY GUN BEARER MAHINA TO TAKE A TURN AT WATCHING
4590-18005-0011 AS I WAS BY THIS TIME WORN OUT FOR WANT OF SLEEP HAVING SPENT SO MANY NIGHTS ON THE LOOK OUT I WAS JUST DOZING OFF COMFORTABLY WHEN SUDDENLY I FELT MY ARM SEIZED AND ON LOOKING UP SAW MAHINA POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GOATS SHER
4590-18005-0012 LION WAS ALL HE WHISPERED I GRASPED MY DOUBLE SMOOTH BORE WHICH I HAD CHARGED WITH SLUG AND WAITED PATIENTLY IN A FEW MOMENTS I WAS REWARDED FOR AS I WATCHED THE SPOT WHERE I EXPECTED THE LION TO APPEAR
4590-18005-0013 THERE WAS A RUSTLING AMONG THE BUSHES AND I SAW HIM STEALTHILY EMERGE INTO THE OPEN AND PASS ALMOST DIRECTLY BENEATH US I FIRED BOTH BARRELS PRACTICALLY TOGETHER INTO HIS SHOULDER AND TO MY JOY COULD SEE HIM GO DOWN UNDER THE FORCE OF THE BLOW
4590-18005-0014 HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AMONG THE BUSHES AND I HAD TO FIRE AFTER HIM QUITE AT RANDOM NEVERTHELESS I WAS CONFIDENT OF GETTING HIM IN THE MORNING AND ACCORDINGLY SET OUT AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT FOR OVER A MILE THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN FOLLOWING THE BLOOD TRAIL
4590-18005-0015 AND AS HE HAD RESTED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT SURE THAT HE HAD BEEN BADLY WOUNDED IN THE END HOWEVER MY HUNT PROVED FRUITLESS FOR AFTER A TIME THE TRACES OF BLOOD CEASED AND THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND BECAME ROCKY
4590-18005-0016 PASSED THROUGH TSAVO ON A TOUR OF INSPECTION ON BEHALF OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE AFTER EXAMINING THE BRIDGE AND OTHER WORKS AND EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION
4590-18005-0017 ONE OR TWO OF WHICH HE HAS KINDLY ALLOWED ME TO REPRODUCE IN THIS BOOK
4590-18005-0018 AND WAS DELIGHTED THAT ONE AT LEAST WAS DEAD WHEN HE ASKED ME IF I EXPECTED TO GET THE SECOND LION SOON I WELL REMEMBER HIS HALF DOUBTING SMILE AS I RATHER TOO CONFIDENTLY ASSERTED THAT I HOPED TO BAG HIM ALSO IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS
4590-18005-0019 AS IT HAPPENED THERE WAS NO SIGN OF OUR ENEMY FOR ABOUT TEN DAYS AFTER THIS AND WE BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HE HAD DIED OF HIS WOUNDS IN THE BUSH
4590-18005-0020 AS OTHERWISE AT LEAST ONE MORE VICTIM WOULD HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE LIST FOR ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH I WAS SUDDENLY AROUSED BY TERRIFIED SHOUTS FROM MY TROLLEY MEN WHO SLEPT IN A TREE CLOSE OUTSIDE MY BOMA
4590-18005-0021 TO THE EFFECT THAT A LION WAS TRYING TO GET AT THEM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS TO HAVE GONE OUT AS THE MOON WAS HIDDEN BY DENSE CLOUDS AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE ANYTHING MORE THAN A YARD IN FRONT OF ONE
4590-18005-0022 AND ROUND THE TREE WAS A REGULAR RING OF HIS FOOTMARKS THE FOLLOWING EVENING I TOOK UP MY POSITION IN THIS SAME TREE IN THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT THE NIGHT BEGAN BADLY AS WHILE CLIMBING UP TO MY PERCH
4590-18005-0023 AS MAY BE IMAGINED I CAME DOWN AGAIN VERY QUICKLY BUT ONE OF MY MEN MANAGED TO DESPATCH IT WITH A LONG POLE FORTUNATELY THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR AND CLOUDLESS AND THE MOON MADE EVERY THING ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS DAY
4590-18005-0024 I KEPT WATCH UNTIL ABOUT TWO A M WHEN I ROUSED MAHINA TO TAKE HIS TURN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR I SLEPT PEACEFULLY WITH MY BACK TO THE TREE
4590-18005-0025 MAHINA HOWEVER WAS ON THE ALERT AND HAD SEEN NOTHING AND ALTHOUGH I LOOKED CAREFULLY ROUND US ON ALL SIDES I TOO COULD DISCOVER NOTHING UNUSUAL ONLY HALF SATISFIED I WAS ABOUT TO LIE BACK AGAIN
4590-18005-0026 WHEN I FANCIED I SAW SOMETHING MOVE A LITTLE WAY OFF AMONG THE LOW BUSHES
4590-18005-0027 IT WAS THE MAN EATER CAUTIOUSLY STALKING US THE GROUND WAS FAIRLY OPEN ROUND OUR TREE WITH ONLY A SMALL BUSH EVERY HERE AND THERE
4590-18005-0028 AND FROM OUR POSITION IT WAS A MOST FASCINATING SIGHT TO WATCH THIS GREAT BRUTE STEALING STEALTHILY ROUND US TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERY BIT OF COVER AS HE CAME HIS SKILL SHOWED THAT HE WAS AN OLD HAND AT THE TERRIBLE GAME OF MAN HUNTING
4590-18005-0029 SO I DETERMINED TO RUN NO UNDUE RISK OF LOSING HIM THIS TIME I ACCORDINGLY WAITED UNTIL HE GOT QUITE CLOSE ABOUT TWENTY YARDS AWAY
4590-18005-0030 I HEARD THE BULLET STRIKE HIM BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT HAD NO KNOCKDOWN EFFECT
4590-18005-0031 AND MADE OFF WITH GREAT LONG BOUNDS BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT HOWEVER I MANAGED TO HAVE THREE MORE SHOTS AT HIM FROM THE MAGAZINE RIFLE AND ANOTHER GROWL TOLD ME THAT THE LAST OF THESE HAD ALSO TAKEN EFFECT
4590-18005-0032 I TOOK A NATIVE TRACKER WITH ME SO THAT I WAS FREE TO KEEP A GOOD LOOK OUT WHILE MAHINA FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BEHIND WITH A MARTINI CARBINE SPLASHES OF BLOOD BEING PLENTIFUL WE WERE ABLE TO GET ALONG QUICKLY AND WE HAD NOT PROCEEDED MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILE THROUGH THE JUNGLE
4590-18005-0033 WHEN SUDDENLY A FIERCE WARNING GROWL WAS HEARD RIGHT IN FRONT OF US LOOKING CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE BUSHES I COULD SEE THE MAN EATER GLARING OUT IN OUR DIRECTION AND SHOWING HIS TUSKS IN AN ANGRY SNARL I AT ONCE TOOK CAREFUL AIM AND FIRED
4590-18005-0034 INSTANTLY HE SPRANG OUT AND MADE A MOST DETERMINED CHARGE DOWN ON US I FIRED AGAIN AND KNOCKED HIM OVER BUT IN A SECOND HE WAS UP ONCE MORE AND COMING FOR ME AS FAST AS HE COULD IN HIS CRIPPLED CONDITION A THIRD SHOT HAD NO APPARENT EFFECT
4590-18005-0035 SO I PUT OUT MY HAND FOR THE MARTINI HOPING TO STOP HIM WITH IT TO MY DISMAY HOWEVER IT WAS NOT THERE THE TERROR OF THE SUDDEN CHARGE HAD PROVED TOO MUCH FOR MAHINA AND BOTH HE AND THE CARBINE WERE BY THIS TIME WELL ON THEIR WAY UP A TREE
4590-18005-0036 EVEN AS IT WAS I HAD BARELY TIME TO SWING MYSELF UP OUT OF HIS REACH BEFORE HE ARRIVED AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE WHEN THE LION FOUND HE WAS TOO LATE HE STARTED TO LIMP BACK TO THE THICKET BUT BY THIS TIME I HAD SEIZED THE CARBINE FROM MAHINA
4590-18005-0037 AND THE FIRST SHOT I FIRED FROM IT SEEMED TO GIVE HIM HIS QUIETUS
4590-18005-0038 RATHER FOOLISHLY I AT ONCE SCRAMBLED DOWN FROM THE TREE AND WALKED UP TOWARDS HIM
4590-18005-0039 AND ATTEMPTED ANOTHER CHARGE THIS TIME HOWEVER A MARTINI BULLET IN THE CHEST AND ANOTHER IN THE HEAD FINISHED HIM FOR GOOD AND ALL HE DROPPED IN HIS TRACKS NOT FIVE YARDS AWAY FROM ME AND DIED GAMELY BITING SAVAGELY AT A BRANCH WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE GROUND
4590-18005-0040 EVENTUALLY AMID THE WILD REJOICINGS OF THE NATIVES AND COOLIES I HAD THE LION CARRIED TO MY BOMA WHICH WAS CLOSE AT HAND ON EXAMINATION WE FOUND NO LESS THAN SIX BULLET HOLES IN THE BODY AND EMBEDDED ONLY A LITTLE WAY IN THE FLESH OF THE BACK
4590-18005-0041 WAS THE SLUG WHICH I HAD FIRED INTO HIM FROM THE SCAFFOLDING ABOUT TEN DAYS PREVIOUSLY HE MEASURED NINE FEET SIX INCHES FROM TIP OF NOSE TO TIP OF TAIL AND STOOD THREE FEET ELEVEN AND A HALF INCHES HIGH
4590-18005-0042 THE NEWS OF THE DEATH OF THE SECOND DEVIL SOON SPREAD FAR AND WIDE OVER THE COUNTRY
4590-18005-0043 BEST OF ALL THE COOLIES WHO HAD ABSCONDED CAME FLOCKING BACK TO TSAVO
4590-18005-0044 THEY COULD NOT NOW DO ENOUGH FOR ME
4590-18005-0045 WRITTEN IN HINDUSTANI DESCRIBING ALL OUR TRIALS AND MY ULTIMATE VICTORY AS THE POEM RELATES OUR TROUBLES IN SOMEWHAT QUAINT AND BIBLICAL LANGUAGE I HAVE GIVEN A TRANSLATION OF IT IN THE APPENDIX
4590-18005-0046 THE BOWL I SHALL ALWAYS CONSIDER MY MOST HIGHLY PRIZED AND HARDEST WON TROPHY THE INSCRIPTION ON IT READS AS FOLLOWS SIR WE YOUR OVERSEER TIMEKEEPERS MISTARIS AND WORKMEN
4590-18005-0047 PRESENT YOU WITH THIS BOWL AS A TOKEN OF OUR GRATITUDE TO YOU FOR YOUR BRAVERY IN KILLING TWO MAN EATING LIONS AT GREAT RISK TO YOUR OWN LIFE THEREBY SAVING US FROM THE FATE OF BEING DEVOURED BY THESE TERRIBLE MONSTERS
4590-18005-0048 WHO NIGHTLY BROKE INTO OUR TENTS AND TOOK OUR FELLOW WORKERS FROM OUR SIDE IN PRESENTING YOU WITH THIS BOWL WE ALL ADD OUR PRAYERS FOR YOUR LONG LIFE HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY WE SHALL EVER REMAIN SIR YOUR GRATEFUL SERVANTS
4590-18005-0049 OVERSEER AND CLERK OF WORKS ON BEHALF OF YOUR WORKMEN DATED AT TSAVO JANUARY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE
4590-18005-0050 OF HAVING BEEN SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE DAY SPEAKING OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH HAD BEEN ENCOUNTERED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE UGANDA RAILWAY THE LATE LORD SALISBURY SAID
4590-18005-0051 AND CONCEIVED A MOST UNFORTUNATE TASTE FOR OUR PORTERS
4590-18005-0052 AT LAST THE LABOURERS ENTIRELY DECLINED TO GO ON UNLESS THEY WERE GUARDED BY AN IRON ENTRENCHMENT OF COURSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO WORK A RAILWAY UNDER THESE CONDITIONS AND UNTIL WE FOUND AN ENTHUSIASTIC SPORTSMAN TO GET RID OF THESE LIONS OUR ENTERPRISE WAS SERIOUSLY HINDERED
4590-18005-0053 ALSO THE SPECTATOR OF MARCH THIRD NINETEEN HUNDRED HAD AN ARTICLE ENTITLED THE LIONS THAT STOPPED THE RAILWAY FROM WHICH THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS ARE TAKEN
4590-18005-0054 THEIR WISH TO PROPITIATE THE LOCAL DEITIES IS EASILY UNDERSTOOD
4590-18005-0055 WHITE OR BLACK THE STORY OF THESE TWO BEASTS TO WHAT A DISTANCE THE WHOLE STORY CARRIES US BACK AND HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT BECOMES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SURVIVAL OF PRIMITIVE MAN AGAINST THIS KIND OF FOE FOR FIRE
4590-18005-0056 WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN REGARDED AS HIS MAIN SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE CARNIVORA THESE CARED NOTHING
4590-18005-0057 I MAY MENTION THAT POISON WAS TRIED BUT WITHOUT EFFECT THE POISONED CARCASES OF TRANSPORT ANIMALS WHICH HAD DIED FROM THE BITE OF THE TSETSE FLY WERE PLACED IN LIKELY SPOTS BUT THE WILY MAN EATERS WOULD NOT TOUCH THEM AND MUCH PREFERRED LIVE MEN TO DEAD DONKEYS
4590-18005-0058 IN THE TROPICAL FOREST BOTH IN AMERICAN AND WEST CENTRAL AFRICA BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE OLD INHABITANTS OF EUROPE OR OF ASSYRIA OR ASIA MINOR EVER KILLED LIONS OR WOLVES BY THIS MEANS THEY LOOKED TO THE KING OR CHIEF OR SOME CHAMPION TO KILL THESE MONSTERS FOR THEM
4590-18005-0059 IT WAS NOT THE SPORT BUT THE DUTY OF KINGS AND WAS IN ITSELF A TITLE TO BE A RULER OF MEN
4590-18005-0060 FROM THE STORY OF THE TSAVO RIVER WE CAN APPRECIATE THEIR SERVICES TO MAN EVEN AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME
