3125-163698-0000 ALL THINGS BEING FULL OF FLAW ALL THINGS BEING FULL OF HOLES THE STRENGTH OF ALL THINGS IS IN SHORTNESS IF SIR ENSOR DOONE HAD DWELLED FOR HALF AN HOUR UPON HIMSELF
3125-163698-0001 AND AN HOUR PERHAPS UPON LORNA AND ME WE MUST BOTH HAVE WEARIED OF HIM AND REQUIRED CHANGE OF AIR BUT NOW I LONGED TO SEE AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT HIM AND HOPED THAT HE MIGHT NOT GO TO HEAVEN FOR AT LEAST A WEEK OR MORE HOWEVER
3125-163698-0002 HE WAS TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD AS WE SAY OF ALL PEOPLE WHO LEAVE IT AND I VERILY BELIEVE HIS HEART WAS NOT A BAD ONE AFTER ALL
3125-163698-0003 YET HOW MANY HAVE DONE EVIL WHILE RECEIVING ONLY GOOD
3125-163698-0004 SETTLED FOR EVER WITHOUT OUR VOTES LET US OWN THAT HE WAS AT LEAST
3125-163698-0005 AND HIS LOSS AROUSED GREAT LAMENTATION NOT AMONG THE DOONES ALONE AND THE WOMEN THEY HAD CARRIED OFF
3125-163698-0006 AND THIS NOT ONLY FROM FEAR LEST ONE MORE WICKED MIGHT SUCCEED HIM AS APPEARED INDEED TOO PROBABLE BUT FROM TRUE ADMIRATION OF HIS STRONG WILL AND SYMPATHY WITH HIS MISFORTUNES
3125-163698-0007 A LAWYER PERHAPS MIGHT HAVE ARGUED IT NOT BUT WHAT HE MAY HAVE MEANT TO BESTOW ON US HIS BLESSING ONLY THAT HE DIED NEXT DAY WITHOUT TAKING THE TROUBLE TO DO IT HE CALLED INDEED FOR HIS BOX OF SNUFF
3125-163698-0008 WHICH WAS A VERY HIGH THING TO TAKE AND WHICH HE NEVER TOOK WITHOUT BEING IN VERY GOOD HUMOUR AT LEAST FOR HIM AND THOUGH IT WOULD NOT GO UP HIS NOSTRILS THROUGH THE FAILURE OF HIS BREATH HE WAS PLEASED TO HAVE IT THERE AND NOT TO THINK OF DYING
3125-163698-0009 I ASKED HIM VERY SOFTLY FOR THE BROWN APPEARANCE OF IT SPOILED TO MY IDEA HIS WHITE MOSTACCHIO BUT HE SEEMED TO SHAKE HIS HEAD AND I THOUGHT IT KEPT HIS SPIRITS UP I HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN ANY ONE DO WHAT ALL OF US HAVE TO DO SOME DAY
3125-163698-0010 AND IT GREATLY KEPT MY SPIRITS DOWN ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT SO VERY MUCH FRIGHTEN ME FOR IT TAKES A MAN BUT A LITTLE WHILE HIS INSTINCT BEING OF DEATH PERHAPS
3125-163698-0011 AT LEAST AS MUCH AS OF LIFE WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR HIS SLAYING HIS FELLOW MEN SO AND EVERY OTHER CREATURE IT DOES NOT TAKE A MAN VERY LONG TO ENTER INTO ANOTHER MAN'S DEATH AND BRING HIS OWN MOOD TO SUIT IT
3125-163698-0012 HE KNOWS THAT HIS OWN IS SURE TO COME AND NATURE IS FOND OF THE PRACTICE HENCE IT CAME TO PASS THAT I AFTER EASING MY MOTHER'S FEARS AND SEEING A LITTLE TO BUSINESS RETURNED AS IF DRAWN BY A POLAR NEEDLE
3125-163698-0013 TO THE DEATH BED OF SIR ENSOR THERE WAS SOME LITTLE CONFUSION PEOPLE WANTING TO GET AWAY AND PEOPLE TRYING TO COME IN FROM DOWNRIGHT CURIOSITY OF ALL THINGS THE MOST HATEFUL
3125-163698-0014 HE FOR HIS PART NEVER ASKED FOR ANY ONE TO COME NEAR HIM NOT EVEN A PRIEST NOR A MONK OR FRIAR BUT SEEMED TO BE GOING HIS OWN WAY PEACEFUL AND WELL CONTENTED
3125-163698-0015 WHEN ONLY WE TWO WERE WITH HIM HE LOOKED AT US BOTH VERY DIMLY AND SOFTLY AS IF HE WISHED TO DO SOMETHING FOR US BUT HAD LEFT IT NOW TOO LATE LORNA HOPED THAT HE WANTED TO BLESS US
3125-163698-0016 I FOLLOWED THE BENT OF HIS POOR SHRUNKEN HAND AND SOUGHT AMONG THE PILINGS AND THERE I FELT SOMETHING HARD AND SHARP AND DREW IT FORTH AND GAVE IT TO HIM
3125-163698-0017 IT FLASHED LIKE THE SPRAY OF A FOUNTAIN UPON US IN THE DARK WINTER OF THE ROOM HE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN HIS HAND BUT LET IT HANG AS DAISIES DO ONLY MAKING LORNA SEE THAT HE MEANT HER TO HAVE IT
3125-163698-0018 AND FROM WHICH YOU HAVE GOT THE RING JOHN BUT GRANDFATHER KEPT IT BECAUSE THE CHILDREN WANTED TO PULL IT FROM MY NECK MAY I HAVE IT NOW DEAR GRANDFATHER NOT UNLESS YOU WISH DEAR DARLING LORNA WEPT AGAIN BECAUSE THE OLD MAN COULD NOT TELL HER
3125-163698-0019 EXCEPT BY ONE VERY FEEBLE NOD THAT SHE WAS DOING WHAT HE WISHED THEN SHE GAVE TO ME THE TRINKET FOR THE SAKE OF SAFETY AND I STOWED IT IN MY BREAST HE SEEMED TO ME TO FOLLOW THIS AND TO BE WELL CONTENT WITH IT
3125-163698-0020 BEFORE SIR ENSOR DOONE WAS BURIED THE GREATEST FROST OF THE CENTURY HAD SET IN WITH ITS IRON HAND AND STEP OF STONE ON EVERYTHING HOW IT CAME IS NOT MY BUSINESS NOR CAN I EXPLAIN IT
3125-163698-0021 AS PEOPLE NOW BEGIN TO DO WHEN THE GROUND IS NOT TO THEIR LIKING THOUGH OF ALL THIS I KNOW NOTHING AND LESS THAN NOTHING I MAY SAY BECAUSE I OUGHT TO KNOW SOMETHING I CAN HEAR WHAT PEOPLE TELL ME AND I CAN SEE BEFORE MY EYES
3125-163698-0022 THE STRONG MEN BROKE THREE GOOD PICKAXES ERE THEY GOT THROUGH THE HARD BROWN SOD STREAKED WITH LITTLE MAPS OF GRAY WHERE OLD SIR ENSOR WAS TO LIE UPON HIS BACK AWAITING THE DARKNESS OF THE JUDGMENT DAY
3125-163698-0023 IT WAS IN THE LITTLE CHAPEL YARD I WILL NOT TELL THE NAME OF IT BECAUSE WE ARE NOW SUCH PROTESTANTS THAT I MIGHT DO IT AN EVIL TURN ONLY IT WAS THE LITTLE PLACE WHERE LORNA'S AUNT SABINA LAY
3125-163698-0024 HERE WAS I REMAINING LONG WITH A LITTLE CURIOSITY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE TOLD ME PLAINLY THAT I MUST BE DAMNED FOR EVER BY A PAPIST FUNERAL AND HERE CAME LORNA SCARCELY BREATHING THROUGH THE THICK OF STUFF AROUND HER
3125-163698-0025 YET WITH ALL HER LITTLE BREATH STEAMING ON THE AIR LIKE FROST I STOOD APART FROM THE CEREMONY IN WHICH OF COURSE I WAS NOT ENTITLED EITHER BY BIRTH OR RELIGION TO BEAR ANY PORTION
3125-163698-0026 AND INDEED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER IN ME TO HAVE KEPT AWAY ALTOGETHER FOR NOW THERE WAS NO ONE TO PROTECT ME AMONG THOSE WILD AND LAWLESS MEN AND BOTH CARVER AND THE COUNSELLOR HAD VOWED A FEARFUL VENGEANCE ON ME AS I HEARD FROM GWENNY
3125-163698-0027 THEY HAD NOT DARED TO MEDDLE WITH ME WHILE THE CHIEF LAY DYING NOR WAS IT IN THEIR POLICY FOR A SHORT TIME AFTER THAT TO ENDANGER THEIR SUCCESSION BY AN OPEN BREACH WITH LORNA WHOSE TENDER AGE AND BEAUTY HELD SO MANY OF THE YOUTHS IN THRALL
3125-163698-0028 THE ANCIENT OUTLAW'S FUNERAL WAS A GRAND AND MOVING SIGHT MORE PERHAPS FROM THE SENSE OF CONTRAST THAN FROM THAT OF FITNESS TO SEE THOSE DARK AND MIGHTY MEN INURED TO ALL OF SIN AND CRIME RECKLESS BOTH OF MAN AND GOD
3125-163698-0029 YET NOW WITH HEADS DEVOUTLY BENT CLASPED HANDS AND DOWNCAST EYES FOLLOWING THE LONG BLACK COFFIN OF THEIR COMMON ANCESTOR TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY MUST JOIN HIM WHEN THEIR SUM OF ILL WAS DONE AND TO SEE THE FEEBLE PRIEST CHANTING OVER THE DEAD FORM
3125-163698-0030 WORDS THE LIVING WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT SPRINKLING WITH HIS LITTLE BROOM DROPS THAT COULD NOT PURIFY WHILE THE CHILDREN ROBED IN WHITE SWUNG THEIR SMOKING CENSERS SLOWLY OVER THE COLD AND TWILIGHT GRAVE
3125-163698-0031 AND AFTER SEEING ALL TO ASK WITH A SHUDDER UNEXPRESSED IS THIS THE END THAT GOD INTENDED FOR A MAN SO PROUD AND STRONG NOT A TEAR WAS SHED UPON HIM EXCEPT FROM THE SWEETEST OF ALL SWEET EYES
3125-163698-0032 NOT A SIGH PURSUED HIM HOME EXCEPT IN HOT ANGER HIS LIFE HAD BEEN COLD AND BITTER AND DISTANT AND NOW A WEEK HAD EXHAUSTED ALL THE SORROW OF THOSE AROUND HIM A GRIEF FLOWING LESS FROM AFFECTION THAN FEAR
3125-163698-0033 AGED MEN WILL SHOW HIS TOMBSTONE MOTHERS HASTE WITH THEIR INFANTS BY IT CHILDREN SHRINK FROM THE NAME UPON IT UNTIL IN TIME HIS HISTORY SHALL LAPSE AND BE FORGOTTEN BY ALL EXCEPT THE GREAT JUDGE AND GOD
3125-163698-0034 TRYING TO KEEP THE COLD AWAY BY VIRTUE OF QUICK MOVEMENT NOT A FLAKE OF SNOW HAD FALLEN YET ALL THE EARTH WAS CAKED AND HARD WITH A DRY BROWN CRUST UPON IT
3125-163698-0035 ALL THE SKY WAS BANKED WITH DARKNESS HARD AUSTERE AND FROWNING THE FOG OF THE LAST THREE WEEKS WAS GONE NEITHER DID ANY RIME REMAIN BUT ALL THINGS HAD A LOOK OF SAMENESS AND A KIND OF FURZY COLOUR
3125-163698-0036 IT WAS FREEZING HARD AND SHARP WITH A PIERCING WIND TO BACK IT AND I HAD OBSERVED THAT THE HOLY WATER FROZE UPON SIR ENSOR'S COFFIN
3125-163698-0037 WITH A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HEAVE AN ASH TREE UP THE CHIMNEY PLACE AND THAT WAS HOW THE BIRDS WERE GOING RATHER THAN FLYING AS THEY USED TO FLY ALL THE BIRDS WERE SET IN ONE DIRECTION STEADILY JOURNEYING WESTWARD
3125-163698-0038 NOT WITH ANY HEAT OF SPEED NEITHER FLYING FAR AT ONCE BUT ALL AS IF ON BUSINESS BOUND PARTLY RUNNING PARTLY FLYING PARTLY FLUTTERING ALONG
3125-163698-0039 THIS MOVEMENT OF THE BIRDS WENT ON EVEN FOR A WEEK OR MORE EVERY KIND OF THRUSHES PASSED US EVERY KIND OF WILD FOWL EVEN PLOVERS WENT AWAY AND CROWS AND SNIPES AND WOOD COCKS
3125-163698-0040 PARTRIDGES THAT CAME TO HAND WITH A DRY NOISE IN THEIR CROPS HEATH POULTS MAKING CUPS OF SNOW AND A FEW POOR HOPPING REDWINGS FLIPPING IN AND OUT THE HEDGE HAVING LOST THE POWER TO FLY
3125-163698-0041 AND ALL THE TIME THEIR GREAT BLACK EYES SET WITH GOLD AROUND THEM SEEMED TO LOOK AT ANY MAN FOR MERCY AND FOR COMFORT ANNIE TOOK A MANY OF THEM ALL THAT SHE COULD FIND HERSELF AND ALL THE BOYS WOULD BRING HER
3125-163698-0042 AND ALL THE SEED SHE COULD THINK OF AND LUMPS OF ROTTEN APPLES
3125-163698-0043 SOME GOT ON AND SOME DIED OFF
3125-163698-0044 BUT I DO ASSURE YOU IT WAS A PRETTY THING TO SEE WHEN SHE WENT TO THEM IN THE MORNING THERE WAS NOT A BIRD BUT KNEW HER WELL AFTER ONE DAY OF COMFORTING AND SOME WOULD COME TO HER HAND AND SIT AND SHUT ONE EYE AND LOOK AT HER
3125-163698-0045 THEN SHE USED TO STROKE THEIR HEADS AND FEEL THEIR BREASTS AND TALK TO THEM AND NOT A BIRD OF THEM ALL WAS THERE BUT LIKED TO HAVE IT DONE TO HIM AND I DO BELIEVE THEY WOULD EAT FROM HER HAND THINGS UNNATURAL TO THEM
3125-163698-0046 OF VERY FINE BRIGHT PLUMAGE AND LARGER THAN A MISSEL THRUSH HE WAS THE HARDEST OF ALL TO PLEASE AND YET HE TRIED TO DO HIS BEST I HAVE HEARD SINCE THEN FROM A MAN WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT BIRDS AND BEASTS AND FISHES
3125-163698-0047 THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN A NORWEGIAN BIRD CALLED IN THIS COUNTRY A ROLLER WHO NEVER COMES TO ENGLAND BUT IN THE MOST TREMENDOUS WINTERS ANOTHER LITTLE BIRD THERE WAS WHOM I LONGED TO WELCOME HOME AND PROTECT FROM ENEMIES
3125-163698-0048 A LITTLE BIRD NO NATIVE TO US BUT THAN ANY NATIVE DEARER BUT LO IN THE VERY NIGHT WHICH FOLLOWED OLD SIR ENSOR'S FUNERAL SUCH A STORM OF SNOW BEGAN AS NEVER HAVE I HEARD NOR READ OF NEITHER COULD HAVE DREAMED IT
3125-163698-0049 AT WHAT TIME OF NIGHT IT FIRST BEGAN IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY AT LEAST FROM MY OWN KNOWLEDGE FOR WE ALL WENT TO BED SOON AFTER SUPPER BEING COLD AND NOT INCLINED TO TALK AT THAT TIME THE WIND WAS MOANING SADLY AND THE SKY AS DARK AS A WOOD
3125-163698-0050 WITH THEIR CHINS UPON ONE ANOTHER BUT WE BEING BLINDER THAN THEY I SUPPOSE AND NOT HAVING HAD A GREAT SNOW FOR YEARS MADE NO PREPARATION AGAINST THE STORM EXCEPT THAT THE LAMBING EWES WERE IN SHELTER
3125-163698-0051 IT STRUCK ME AS I LAY IN BED THAT WE WERE ACTING FOOLISHLY FOR AN ANCIENT SHEPHERD HAD DROPPED IN AND TAKEN SUPPER WITH US AND FORETOLD A HEAVY FALL AND GREAT DISASTER TO LIVE STOCK
3125-163698-0052 HE SAID THAT HE HAD KNOWN A FROST BEGINNING JUST AS THIS HAD DONE WITH A BLACK EAST WIND AFTER DAYS OF RAW COLD FOG AND THEN ON THE THIRD NIGHT OF THE FROST AT THIS VERY TIME OF YEAR
3125-163698-0053 TO WIT ON THE FIFTEENTH OF DECEMBER SUCH A SNOW SET IN AS KILLED HALF OF THE SHEEP AND MANY EVEN OF THE RED DEER AND THE FOREST PONIES
3125-163698-0054 AND EVEN THE POULTRY SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN SNUG AND WITH PLENTY TO EAT AND FODDER ENOUGH TO ROAST THEM
3125-163698-0055 WHEN THEY COME A DAY TOO LATE EVEN IF THEY MAY AVAIL A LITTLE WHEN THEY ARE MOST PUNCTUAL IN THE BITTER MORNING I AROSE TO FOLLOW OUT MY PURPOSE KNOWING THE TIME FROM THE FORCE OF HABIT ALTHOUGH THE ROOM WAS SO DARK AND GRAY
3125-163698-0056 WHILE ALL THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM WAS GRISLY LIKE THE HEART OF A MOULDY OAT RICK I WENT TO THE WINDOW AT ONCE OF COURSE
3125-163698-0057 AND THERE GOT HOLD OF A FINE ASH STAKE CUT BY MYSELF NOT LONG AGO WITH THIS I PLOUGHED ALONG PRETTY WELL AND THUNDERED SO HARD AT JOHN FRY'S DOOR THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE DOONES AT LEAST AND COCKED HIS BLUNDERBUSS OUT OF THE WINDOW
3125-163698-0058 UNLESS HE CAME IN FIVE MINUTES NOT THAT HE COULD DO MUCH GOOD BUT BECAUSE THE OTHER MEN WOULD BE SURE TO SKULK IF HE SET THEM THE EXAMPLE
