7240-92200-0000 I WAS PASSIVE IN THE WHOLE MATTER A LITTLE GIRL COUSIN OF MINE WAS PUT IN A BAG AND SUSPENDED FROM THE HORN OF AN INDIAN SADDLE
7240-92200-0001 ACCORDINGLY I WAS PUT INTO ANOTHER SACK AND MADE TO KEEP THE SADDLE AND THE GIRL IN POSITION I DID NOT OBJECT FOR I HAD A VERY PLEASANT GAME OF PEEK A BOO WITH THE LITTLE GIRL
7240-92200-0002 UNTIL WE CAME TO A BIG SNOW DRIFT WHERE THE POOR BEAST WAS STUCK FAST AND BEGAN TO LIE DOWN THEN IT WAS NOT SO NICE
7240-92200-0003 AT LEAST I USED TO THINK SO I BELIEVE I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ALL THE PRECARIOUS INDIAN CONVEYANCES AND AS A BOY I ENJOYED THE DOG TRAVAUX RIDE AS MUCH AS ANY
7240-92200-0004 WHICH WERE HARNESSED TO THE SIDES OF THE ANIMAL AS IF HE STOOD BETWEEN SHAFTS WHILE THE FREE ENDS WERE ALLOWED TO DRAG ON THE GROUND BOTH PONIES AND LARGE DOGS WERE USED AS BEASTS OF BURDEN
7240-92200-0005 AND THEY CARRIED IN THIS WAY THE SMALLER CHILDREN AS WELL AS THE BAGGAGE THIS MODE OF TRAVELLING FOR CHILDREN WAS POSSIBLE ONLY IN THE SUMMER AND AS THE DOGS WERE SOMETIMES UNRELIABLE
7240-92200-0006 THE LITTLE ONES WERE EXPOSED TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DANGER FOR INSTANCE WHENEVER A TRAIN OF DOGS HAD BEEN TRAVELLING FOR A LONG TIME ALMOST PERISHING WITH THE HEAT AND THEIR HEAVY LOADS
7240-92200-0007 A GLIMPSE OF WATER WOULD CAUSE THEM TO FORGET ALL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES SOME OF THEM IN SPITE OF THE SCREAMS OF THE WOMEN WOULD SWIM WITH THEIR BURDENS INTO THE COOLING STREAM AND I WAS THUS ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION
7240-92200-0008 MADE TO PARTAKE OF AN UNWILLING BATH I WAS A LITTLE OVER FOUR YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE IN MINNESOTA IN THE GENERAL TURMOIL WE TOOK FLIGHT INTO BRITISH COLUMBIA
7240-92200-0009 AND THE JOURNEY IS STILL VIVIDLY REMEMBERED BY ALL OUR FAMILY A YOKE OF OXEN AND A LUMBER WAGON WERE TAKEN FROM SOME WHITE FARMER AND BROUGHT HOME FOR OUR CONVEYANCE
7240-92200-0010 HOW DELIGHTED I WAS WHEN I LEARNED THAT WE WERE TO RIDE BEHIND THOSE WISE LOOKING ANIMALS AND IN THAT GORGEOUSLY PAINTED WAGON IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE A LIVING CREATURE TO ME THIS NEW VEHICLE WITH FOUR LEGS
7240-92200-0011 AND THE MORE SO WHEN WE GOT OUT OF AXLE GREASE AND THE WHEELS WENT ALONG SQUEALING LIKE PIGS THE BOYS FOUND A GREAT DEAL OF INNOCENT FUN IN JUMPING FROM THE HIGH WAGON WHILE THE OXEN WERE LEISURELY MOVING ALONG
7240-92200-0012 ALAS BEFORE I COULD REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED I WAS UNDER THE WHEELS AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE NEIGHBOR IMMEDIATELY BEHIND US I MIGHT HAVE BEEN RUN OVER BY THE NEXT TEAM AS WELL
7240-92200-0013 THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH A CIVILIZED VEHICLE I CRIED OUT ALL POSSIBLE REPROACHES ON THE WHITE MAN'S TEAM AND CONCLUDED THAT A DOG TRAVAUX WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
7240-92200-0014 I WAS REALLY REJOICED THAT WE WERE MOVING AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THE WAGON THAT HAD ALMOST ENDED MY LIFE AND IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME THAT I ALONE WAS TO BLAME I COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO RIDE IN THAT WAGON AGAIN
7240-92200-0015 NOW THE MISSOURI IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST TREACHEROUS RIVERS IN THE WORLD EVEN A GOOD MODERN BOAT IS NOT SAFE UPON ITS UNCERTAIN CURRENT WE WERE FORCED TO CROSS IN BUFFALO SKIN BOATS AS ROUND AS TUBS
7240-92200-0016 BRACED WITH RIBS OF WILLOW SOME OF THESE WERE TOWED BY TWO OR THREE WOMEN OR MEN SWIMMING IN THE WATER AND SOME BY PONIES IT WAS NOT AN EASY MATTER TO KEEP THEM RIGHT SIDE UP
7240-92200-0017 AND IN THE LONG NIGHT MARCHES TO GET AWAY FROM THE SOLDIERS WE SUFFERED FROM LOSS OF SLEEP AND INSUFFICIENT FOOD OUR MEALS WERE EATEN HASTILY AND SOMETIMES IN THE SADDLE WATER WAS NOT ALWAYS TO BE FOUND
7240-92200-0018 WHICH SAVED OUR LIVES ONE OF THE MOST THRILLING EXPERIENCES OF THE FOLLOWING WINTER WAS A BLIZZARD WHICH OVERTOOK US IN OUR WANDERINGS HERE AND THERE A FAMILY LAY DOWN IN THE SNOW
7240-92200-0019 FOR A DAY AND A NIGHT WE LAY UNDER THE SNOW UNCLE STUCK A LONG POLE BESIDE US TO TELL US WHEN THE STORM WAS OVER WE HAD PLENTY OF BUFFALO ROBES AND THE SNOW KEPT US WARM BUT WE FOUND IT HEAVY
7240-92200-0020 AND WE HAD SEVERAL NARROW ESCAPES FROM DEATH IN SAVAGE LIFE THE EARLY SPRING IS THE MOST TRYING TIME AND ALMOST ALL THE FAMINES OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD OF THE YEAR
7240-92200-0021 IN TIMES OF FAMINE THE ADULTS OFTEN DENIED THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO MAKE THE FOOD LAST AS LONG AS POSSIBLE FOR THE CHILDREN WHO WERE NOT ABLE TO BEAR HUNGER AS WELL AS THE OLD
7240-92200-0022 AS A PEOPLE THEY CAN LIVE WITHOUT FOOD MUCH LONGER THAN ANY OTHER NATION I ONCE PASSED THROUGH ONE OF THESE HARD SPRINGS WHEN WE HAD NOTHING TO EAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS
7240-92200-0023 ALTHOUGH I HAD ONLY A SMALL WING OF A SMALL BIRD FOR MY SHARE SOON AFTER THIS WE CAME INTO A REGION WHERE BUFFALOES WERE PLENTY AND HUNGER AND SCARCITY WERE FORGOTTEN SUCH WAS THE INDIANS WILD LIFE
7240-92200-0024 LITTLE PREPARATION WAS MADE FOR THE FUTURE THEY ARE CHILDREN OF NATURE AND OCCASIONALLY SHE WHIPS THEM WITH THE LASHES OF EXPERIENCE YET THEY ARE FORGETFUL AND CARELESS MUCH OF THEIR SUFFERING MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED
7240-92200-0025 BY A LITTLE CALCULATION DURING THE SUMMER WHEN NATURE IS AT HER BEST AND PROVIDES ABUNDANTLY FOR THE SAVAGE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO LIFE IS HAPPIER THAN HIS FOOD IS FREE
7240-92200-0026 EVERYTHING FREE ALL WERE ALIKE RICH IN THE SUMMER AND AGAIN ALL WERE ALIKE POOR IN THE WINTER AND EARLY SPRING HOWEVER THEIR DISEASES WERE FEWER AND NOT SO DESTRUCTIVE AS NOW
7240-92200-0027 AND THE INDIAN'S HEALTH WAS GENERALLY GOOD THE INDIAN BOY ENJOYED SUCH A LIFE AS ALMOST ALL BOYS DREAM OF AND WOULD CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES IF THEY WERE PERMITTED TO DO SO
7240-92200-0028 ONLY A FEW OF THEM WERE RECOVERED AND OUR JOURNEYS AFTER THIS MISFORTUNE WERE EFFECTED MOSTLY BY MEANS OF THE DOG TRAVAUX THE SECOND WINTER AFTER THE MASSACRE MY FATHER AND MY TWO OLDER BROTHERS WITH SEVERAL OTHERS
7240-92200-0029 WERE BETRAYED BY A HALF BREED AT WINNIPEG TO THE UNITED STATES AUTHORITIES AS I WAS THEN LIVING WITH MY UNCLE IN ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY I BECAME SEPARATED FROM THEM FOR TEN YEARS
