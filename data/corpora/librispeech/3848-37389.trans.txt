3848-37389-0000 CHAPTER SIX AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT RICARDO WAS LOUNGING ALONE ON THE VERANDA OF THE FORMER COUNTING HOUSE HE SCENTED SOME NEW DEVELOPMENT AT ONCE AND RAN DOWN TO MEET THE TROTTING BEAR LIKE FIGURE
3848-37389-0001 THE DEEP GROWLING NOISES IT MADE THOUGH THEY HAD ONLY A VERY REMOTE RESEMBLANCE TO THE SPANISH LANGUAGE OR INDEED TO ANY SORT OF HUMAN SPEECH WERE FROM LONG PRACTICE QUITE INTELLIGIBLE TO MISTER JONES'S SECRETARY
3848-37389-0002 RICARDO WAS RATHER SURPRISED HE HAD IMAGINED THAT THE GIRL WOULD CONTINUE TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT THAT LINE APPARENTLY WAS GIVEN UP HE DID NOT MISTRUST HER HOW COULD HE INDEED
3848-37389-0003 HE COULD NOT THINK OF HER EXISTENCE CALMLY HE TRIED TO KEEP HER IMAGE OUT OF HIS MIND
3848-37389-0004 BOTH FOR HIS OWN SAKE AND AS THE FAITHFUL FOLLOWER OF PLAIN MISTER JONES GENTLEMAN HE COLLECTED HIS WITS AND THOUGHT THIS WAS A CHANGE OF POLICY PROBABLY ON THE PART OF HEYST IF SO
3848-37389-0005 WHAT COULD IT MEAN A DEEP FELLOW UNLESS IT WAS HER DOING IN WHICH CASE
3848-37389-0006 BEFORE HIM PEDRO LIFTING HIS FEET ALTERNATELY SWAYED TO AND FRO SIDEWAYS HIS USUAL ATTITUDE OF EXPECTATION HIS LITTLE RED EYES LOST IN THE MASS OF HAIR WERE MOTIONLESS
3848-37389-0007 RICARDO STARED INTO THEM WITH CALCULATED CONTEMPT AND SAID IN A ROUGH ANGRY VOICE WOMAN OF COURSE THERE IS WE KNOW THAT WITHOUT YOU HE GAVE THE TAME MONSTER A PUSH GIT
3848-37389-0008 VAMOS WADDLE GET BACK AND COOK THE DINNER
3848-37389-0009 PEDRO EXTENDED A HUGE HAIRY FOREARM TO SHOW THE DIRECTION AND WENT OFF ON HIS BANDY LEGS ADVANCING A FEW STEPS RICARDO WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE ABOVE SOME BUSHES
3848-37389-0010 TWO WHITE HELMETS MOVING SIDE BY SIDE IN THE CLEARING THEY DISAPPEARED
3848-37389-0011 THAT THERE WAS A WOMAN ON THE ISLAND HE COULD INDULGE IN SPECULATION AS TO THE MOVEMENTS OF THESE PEOPLE HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS MISTER JONES HAD UNDERGONE A SPIRITUAL CHANGE OF WHICH HE HIMSELF WAS NOT YET FULLY AWARE
3848-37389-0012 THAT MORNING BEFORE TIFFIN
3848-37389-0013 THE HEYST BUNGALOW COMPLETED IN SUCH AN INSPIRING WAY BY THE RECOVERY OF THE SLIPPER
3848-37389-0014 REELING AS HE RAN HIS HEAD IN A WHIRL HE WAS WILDLY EXCITED BY VISIONS OF INCONCEIVABLE PROMISE HE WAITED TO COMPOSE HIMSELF BEFORE HE DARED TO MEET THE GOVERNOR ON ENTERING THE ROOM HE FOUND MISTER JONES
3848-37389-0015 SITTING ON THE CAMP BEDSTEAD LIKE A TAILOR ON HIS BOARD CROSS LEGGED
3848-37389-0016 I SAY SIR YOU AREN'T GOING TO TELL ME YOU ARE BORED BORED NO WHERE THE DEVIL HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME OBSERVING WATCHING NOSING AROUND WHAT ELSE
3848-37389-0017 I KNEW YOU HAD COMPANY HAVE YOU TALKED FREELY SIR YES I HAVE MUTTERED MISTER JONES NOT DOWNRIGHT PLAIN SIR NO I WISHED YOU HAD BEEN HERE
3848-37389-0018 YOU LOAF ALL THE MORNING AND NOW YOU COME IN OUT OF BREATH WHAT'S THE MATTER
3848-37389-0019 SAID RICARDO NOTHING'S THE MATTER
3848-37389-0020 HE WAS IN TRUTH STILL PANTING ONLY IT WAS NOT WITH RUNNING BUT WITH THE TUMULT OF THOUGHTS AND SENSATIONS LONG REPRESSED
3848-37389-0021 HE WAS ALMOST DISTRACTED BY THEM NOW HE FORGOT HIMSELF IN THE MAZE OF POSSIBILITIES THREATENING AND INSPIRING AND SO YOU HAD A LONG TALK HE SAID TO GAIN TIME CONFOUND YOU
3848-37389-0022 THE SUN HASN'T AFFECTED YOUR HEAD HAS IT
3848-37389-0023 BEG PARDON SIR WASN'T AWARE I STARED RICARDO APOLOGIZED GOOD HUMOUREDLY THE SUN MIGHT WELL AFFECT A THICKER SKULL THAN MINE
3848-37389-0024 A SALAMANDER YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HERE OBSERVED MISTER JONES DID THE BEAST GIVE ANY SIGNS OF WANTING TO PRANCE ASKED RICARDO QUICKLY WITH ABSOLUTELY GENUINE ANXIETY IT WOULDN'T DO SIR
3848-37389-0025 YOU MUST PLAY HIM EASY FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF DAYS SIR I HAVE A PLAN I HAVE A NOTION THAT I CAN FIND OUT A LOT IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
3848-37389-0026 IN WHAT WAY WHY BY WATCHING RICARDO ANSWERED SLOWLY MISTER JONES GRUNTED NOTHING NEW THAT
3848-37389-0027 WHY NOT PRAY A LITTLE TOO HA HA HA THAT'S A GOOD ONE BURST OUT THE SECRETARY FIXING MISTER JONES WITH MIRTHLESS EYES THE LATTER DROPPED THE SUBJECT INDOLENTLY OH
3848-37389-0028 YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF AT LEAST TWO DAYS HE SAID RICARDO RECOVERED HIMSELF HIS EYES GLEAMED VOLUPTUOUSLY WE'LL PULL THIS OFF YET CLEAN WHOLE RIGHT THROUGH
3848-37389-0029 I AM TRUSTING YOU RIGHT ENOUGH SAID MISTER JONES IT'S YOUR INTEREST TOO AND INDEED RICARDO WAS TRUTHFUL ENOUGH IN HIS STATEMENT HE DID ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IN SUCCESS NOW
3848-37389-0030 BUT HE COULDN'T TELL HIS GOVERNOR THAT HE HAD INTELLIGENCES IN THE ENEMY'S CAMP IT WOULDN'T DO TO TELL HIM OF THE GIRL DEVIL ONLY KNEW WHAT HE WOULD DO IF HE LEARNED THERE WAS A WOMAN ABOUT
3848-37389-0031 WE'LL PULL IT OFF SIR HE SAID WITH PERFECTLY ACTED CHEERFULNESS HE EXPERIENCED GUSTS OF AWFUL JOY EXPANDING IN HIS HEART AND HOT LIKE A FANNED FLAME WE MUST
3848-37389-0032 PRONOUNCED MISTER JONES THIS THING MARTIN IS NOT LIKE OUR OTHER TRIES
3848-37389-0033 IT'S A DIFFERENT THING IT'S A SORT OF TEST RICARDO WAS IMPRESSED BY THE GOVERNOR'S MANNER FOR THE FIRST TIME A HINT OF PASSION COULD BE DETECTED IN HIM
3848-37389-0034 THE WORD TEST HAD STRUCK HIM AS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT SOMEHOW IT WAS THE LAST WORD UTTERED DURING THAT MORNING'S CONVERSATION IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS RICARDO WENT OUT OF THE ROOM
3848-37389-0035 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO KEEP STILL AN ELATION IN WHICH AN EXTRAORDINARY SOFTNESS MINGLED WITH SAVAGE TRIUMPH WOULD NOT ALLOW IT IT PREVENTED HIS THINKING ALSO
3848-37389-0036 HE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE VERANDA FAR INTO THE AFTERNOON EYEING THE OTHER BUNGALOW AT EVERY TURN IT GAVE NO SIGN OF BEING INHABITED ONCE OR TWICE HE STOPPED DEAD SHORT AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIS LEFT SLIPPER
3848-37389-0037 EACH TIME HE CHUCKLED AUDIBLY HIS RESTLESSNESS KEPT ON INCREASING TILL AT LAST IT FRIGHTENED HIM HE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE BALUSTRADE OF THE VERANDA AND STOOD STILL
3848-37389-0038 BUT AT THE STRONG SENSE OF LIFE WITHIN HIM HE ABANDONED HIMSELF TO IT CARELESSLY EVEN RECKLESSLY HE CARED FOR NO ONE FRIEND OR ENEMY AT THAT MOMENT MISTER JONES CALLED HIM BY NAME FROM WITHIN
3848-37389-0039 A SHADOW FELL ON THE SECRETARY'S FACE HERE SIR HE ANSWERED BUT IT WAS A MOMENT BEFORE HE COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO GO IN HE FOUND THE GOVERNOR ON HIS FEET MISTER JONES WAS TIRED OF LYING DOWN
3848-37389-0040 WHEN THERE WAS NO NECESSITY FOR IT HIS SLENDER FORM GLIDING ABOUT THE ROOM CAME TO A STANDSTILL I'VE BEEN THINKING MARTIN OF SOMETHING YOU SUGGESTED AT THE TIME IT DID NOT STRIKE ME AS PRACTICAL
3848-37389-0041 BUT ON REFLECTION IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO PROPOSE A GAME IS AS GOOD A WAY AS ANY TO LET HIM UNDERSTAND THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO DISGORGE IT'S LESS HOW SHOULD I SAY VULGAR
3848-37389-0042 HE WILL KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IT'S NOT A BAD FORM TO GIVE TO THE BUSINESS WHICH IN ITSELF IS CRUDE MARTIN CRUDE WANT TO SPARE HIS FEELINGS JEERED THE SECRETARY IN SUCH A BITTER TONE THAT
3848-37389-0043 MISTER JONES WAS REALLY SURPRISED WHY IT WAS YOUR OWN NOTION CONFOUND YOU WHO SAYS IT WASN'T RETORTED RICARDO SULKILY BUT I AM FAIRLY SICK OF THIS CRAWLING NO NO
3848-37389-0044 GET THE EXACT BEARINGS OF HIS SWAG AND THEN A RIP UP THAT'S PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM HIS PASSIONS BEING THOROUGHLY AROUSED A THIRST FOR BLOOD WAS ALLIED IN HIM WITH A THIRST FOR TENDERNESS YES TENDERNESS
3848-37389-0045 A SORT OF ANXIOUS MELTING SENSATION PERVADED AND SOFTENED HIS HEART WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THAT GIRL ONE OF HIS OWN SORT AND AT THE SAME TIME JEALOUSY STARTED GNAWING AT HIS BREAST AS THE IMAGE OF HEYST
3848-37389-0046 INTRUDED ITSELF ON HIS FIERCE ANTICIPATION OF BLISS THE CRUDENESS OF YOUR FEROCITY IS POSITIVELY GROSS MARTIN MISTER JONES SAID DISDAINFULLY YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND MY PURPOSE
3848-37389-0047 I MEAN TO HAVE SOME SPORT OUT OF HIM JUST TRY TO IMAGINE THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE GAME THE FELLOW HANDLING THE CARDS THE AGONIZING MOCKERY OF IT OH I SHALL APPRECIATE THIS GREATLY YES
3848-37389-0048 LET HIM LOSE HIS MONEY INSTEAD OF BEING FORCED TO HAND IT OVER YOU OF COURSE WOULD SHOOT HIM AT ONCE BUT I SHALL ENJOY THE REFINEMENT AND THE JEST OF IT HE'S A MAN OF THE BEST SOCIETY
3848-37389-0049 I'VE BEEN HOUNDED OUT OF MY SPHERE BY PEOPLE VERY MUCH LIKE THAT FELLOW HOW ENRAGED AND HUMILIATED HE WILL BE I PROMISE MYSELF SOME EXQUISITE MOMENTS WHILE WATCHING HIS PLAY AY AND
3848-37389-0050 SUPPOSE HE SUDDENLY STARTS PRANCING HE MAY NOT APPRECIATE THE FUN
3848-37389-0051 AS I AM FREE TO PLUG HIM OR RIP HIM UP WHENEVER I THINK THE TIME HAS COME YOU ARE WELCOME TO YOUR BIT OF SPORT SIR
