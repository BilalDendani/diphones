1421-8534-0000 MARY HAD HAD HER EVILS BUT UPON THE WHOLE AS WAS EVIDENT BY HER STAYING SO LONG SHE HAD FOUND MORE TO ENJOY THAN TO SUFFER
1421-8534-0001 AND WHEN THEY DINED WITH THE HARVILLES THERE HAD BEEN ONLY A MAID SERVANT TO WAIT AND AT FIRST MISSUS HARVILLE HAD ALWAYS GIVEN MISSUS MUSGROVE PRECEDENCE BUT THEN SHE HAD RECEIVED SO VERY HANDSOME AN APOLOGY FROM HER ON FINDING OUT WHOSE DAUGHTER SHE WAS
1421-8534-0002 AND THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH GOING ON EVERY DAY THERE HAD BEEN SO MANY WALKS BETWEEN THEIR LODGINGS AND THE HARVILLES AND SHE HAD GOT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY AND CHANGED THEM SO OFTEN THAT THE BALANCE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN MUCH IN FAVOUR OF LYME SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO CHARMOUTH TOO
1421-8534-0003 AND SHE HAD BATHED AND SHE HAD GONE TO CHURCH AND THERE WERE A GREAT MANY MORE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT IN THE CHURCH AT LYME THAN AT UPPERCROSS AND ALL THIS JOINED TO THE SENSE OF BEING SO VERY USEFUL HAD MADE REALLY AN AGREEABLE FORTNIGHT ANNE ENQUIRED AFTER CAPTAIN BENWICK
1421-8534-0004 MARY'S FACE WAS CLOUDED DIRECTLY CHARLES LAUGHED OH CAPTAIN BENWICK IS VERY WELL I BELIEVE
1421-8534-0005 WE ASKED HIM TO COME HOME WITH US FOR A DAY OR TWO CHARLES UNDERTOOK TO GIVE HIM SOME SHOOTING AND HE
1421-8534-0006 ON TUESDAY NIGHT HE MADE A VERY AWKWARD SORT OF EXCUSE
1421-8534-0007 AND HE HAD PROMISED THIS AND HE HAD PROMISED THAT
1421-8534-0008 I SUPPOSE HE WAS AFRAID OF FINDING IT DULL BUT UPON MY WORD I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE LIVELY ENOUGH AT THE COTTAGE FOR SUCH A HEART BROKEN MAN AS CAPTAIN BENWICK CHARLES LAUGHED AGAIN AND SAID NOW MARY YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW IT REALLY WAS IT WAS ALL YOUR DOING TURNING TO ANNE
1421-8534-0009 HE FANCIED THAT IF HE WENT WITH US HE SHOULD FIND YOU CLOSE BY HE FANCIED EVERYBODY TO BE LIVING IN UPPERCROSS AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT LADY RUSSELL LIVED THREE MILES OFF HIS HEART FAILED HIM AND HE HAD NOT COURAGE TO COME THAT IS THE FACT UPON MY HONOUR MARY KNOWS IT IS
1421-8534-0010 BUT MARY DID NOT GIVE INTO IT VERY GRACIOUSLY WHETHER FROM NOT CONSIDERING CAPTAIN BENWICK ENTITLED BY BIRTH AND SITUATION TO BE IN LOVE WITH AN ELLIOT OR FROM NOT WANTING TO BELIEVE ANNE A GREATER ATTRACTION TO UPPERCROSS THAN HERSELF MUST BE LEFT TO BE GUESSED
1421-8534-0011 ANNE'S GOOD WILL HOWEVER WAS NOT TO BE LESSENED BY WHAT SHE HEARD SHE BOLDLY ACKNOWLEDGED HERSELF FLATTERED AND CONTINUED HER ENQUIRIES OH HE TALKS OF YOU CRIED CHARLES IN SUCH TERMS
1421-8534-0012 NO ADMITTED CHARLES I DO NOT KNOW THAT HE EVER DOES IN A GENERAL WAY BUT HOWEVER IT IS A VERY CLEAR THING THAT HE ADMIRES YOU EXCEEDINGLY HIS HEAD IS FULL OF SOME BOOKS THAT HE IS READING UPON YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THEM
1421-8534-0013 I OVERHEARD HIM TELLING HENRIETTA ALL ABOUT IT AND THEN MISS ELLIOT WAS SPOKEN OF IN THE HIGHEST TERMS NOW MARY I DECLARE IT WAS SO I HEARD IT MYSELF AND YOU WERE IN THE OTHER ROOM
1421-8534-0014 IT WAS A VERY LITTLE TO HIS CREDIT IF HE DID MISS HARVILLE ONLY DIED LAST JUNE SUCH A HEART IS VERY LITTLE WORTH HAVING IS IT LADY RUSSELL
1421-8534-0015 I MUST SEE CAPTAIN BENWICK BEFORE I DECIDE SAID LADY RUSSELL SMILING
1421-8534-0016 SAID CHARLES THOUGH HE HAD NOT NERVES FOR COMING AWAY WITH US AND SETTING OFF AGAIN AFTERWARDS TO PAY A FORMAL VISIT HERE HE WILL MAKE HIS WAY OVER TO KELLYNCH ONE DAY BY HIMSELF YOU MAY DEPEND ON IT I TOLD HIM THE DISTANCE AND THE ROAD AND I TOLD HIM OF THE CHURCH'S BEING SO VERY WELL WORTH SEEING
1421-8534-0017 SO I GIVE YOU NOTICE LADY RUSSELL ANY ACQUAINTANCE OF ANNE'S WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOME TO ME WAS LADY RUSSELL'S KIND ANSWER
1421-8534-0018 FOR I HAVE BEEN SEEING HIM EVERY DAY THIS LAST FORTNIGHT WELL AS YOUR JOINT ACQUAINTANCE THEN I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE CAPTAIN BENWICK
1421-8534-0019 HE IS ONE OF THE DULLEST YOUNG MEN THAT EVER LIVED
1421-8534-0020 THERE WE DIFFER MARY SAID ANNE I THINK LADY RUSSELL WOULD LIKE HIM I THINK SHE WOULD BE SO MUCH PLEASED WITH HIS MIND THAT SHE WOULD VERY SOON SEE NO DEFICIENCY IN HIS MANNER SO DO I ANNE SAID CHARLES I AM SURE LADY RUSSELL WOULD LIKE HIM HE IS JUST LADY RUSSELL'S SORT
1421-8534-0021 GIVE HIM A BOOK AND HE WILL READ ALL DAY LONG YES THAT HE WILL EXCLAIMED MARY TAUNTINGLY HE WILL SIT PORING OVER HIS BOOK AND NOT KNOW WHEN A PERSON SPEAKS TO HIM OR WHEN ONE DROP'S ONE'S SCISSORS OR
1421-8534-0022 DO YOU THINK LADY RUSSELL WOULD LIKE THAT LADY RUSSELL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING UPON MY WORD SAID SHE I SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT MY OPINION OF ANY ONE COULD HAVE ADMITTED OF SUCH DIFFERENCE OF CONJECTURE
1421-8534-0023 I HAVE REALLY A CURIOSITY TO SEE THE PERSON WHO CAN GIVE OCCASION TO SUCH DIRECTLY OPPOSITE NOTIONS
1421-8534-0024 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT TO JUDGE HIM BEFOREHAND YOU WILL NOT LIKE HIM I WILL ANSWER FOR IT LADY RUSSELL BEGAN TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE MARY SPOKE WITH ANIMATION OF THEIR MEETING WITH OR RATHER MISSING MISTER ELLIOT SO EXTRAORDINARILY HE IS A MAN SAID LADY RUSSELL
1421-8534-0025 WHOM I HAVE NO WISH TO SEE HIS DECLINING TO BE ON CORDIAL TERMS WITH THE HEAD OF HIS FAMILY HAS LEFT A VERY STRONG IMPRESSION IN HIS DISFAVOUR WITH ME
1421-8534-0026 WITH REGARD TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THOUGH ANNE HAZARDED NO ENQUIRIES THERE WAS VOLUNTARY COMMUNICATION SUFFICIENT HIS SPIRITS HAD BEEN GREATLY RECOVERING LATELY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED AS LOUISA IMPROVED HE HAD IMPROVED
1421-8534-0027 AND HE WAS NOW QUITE A DIFFERENT CREATURE FROM WHAT HE HAD BEEN THE FIRST WEEK HE HAD NOT SEEN LOUISA AND WAS SO EXTREMELY FEARFUL OF ANY ILL CONSEQUENCE TO HER FROM AN INTERVIEW THAT HE DID NOT PRESS FOR IT AT ALL
1421-8534-0028 HE HAD TALKED OF GOING DOWN TO PLYMOUTH FOR A WEEK AND WANTED TO PERSUADE CAPTAIN BENWICK TO GO WITH HIM BUT AS CHARLES MAINTAINED TO THE LAST CAPTAIN BENWICK SEEMED MUCH MORE DISPOSED TO RIDE OVER TO KELLYNCH
1421-8534-0029 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT LADY RUSSELL AND ANNE WERE BOTH OCCASIONALLY THINKING OF CAPTAIN BENWICK FROM THIS TIME LADY RUSSELL COULD NOT HEAR THE DOOR BELL WITHOUT FEELING THAT IT MIGHT BE HIS HERALD NOR COULD ANNE RETURN FROM ANY STROLL OF SOLITARY INDULGENCE IN HER FATHER'S GROUNDS
1421-8534-0030 WITHOUT WONDERING WHETHER SHE MIGHT SEE HIM OR HEAR OF HIM CAPTAIN BENWICK CAME NOT HOWEVER
1421-8534-0031 OR HE WAS TOO SHY AND AFTER GIVING HIM A WEEK'S INDULGENCE LADY RUSSELL DETERMINED HIM TO BE UNWORTHY OF THE INTEREST WHICH HE HAD BEEN BEGINNING TO EXCITE THE MUSGROVES CAME BACK TO RECEIVE THEIR HAPPY BOYS AND GIRLS FROM SCHOOL
1421-8534-0032 BRINGING WITH THEM MISSUS HARVILLE'S LITTLE CHILDREN TO IMPROVE THE NOISE OF UPPERCROSS AND LESSEN THAT OF LYME HENRIETTA REMAINED WITH LOUISA BUT ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE AGAIN IN THEIR USUAL QUARTERS LADY RUSSELL AND ANNE PAID THEIR COMPLIMENTS TO THEM ONCE
1421-8534-0033 WHEN ANNE COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT UPPERCROSS WAS ALREADY QUITE ALIVE AGAIN THOUGH NEITHER HENRIETTA NOR LOUISA NOR CHARLES HAYTER NOR CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WERE THERE
1421-8534-0034 IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING MISSUS MUSGROVE WERE THE LITTLE HARVILLES WHOM SHE WAS SEDULOUSLY GUARDING FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE TWO CHILDREN FROM THE COTTAGE EXPRESSLY ARRIVED TO AMUSE THEM ON ONE SIDE WAS A TABLE OCCUPIED BY SOME CHATTERING GIRLS CUTTING UP SILK AND GOLD PAPER
1421-8534-0035 AND ON THE OTHER WERE TRESSELS AND TRAYS BENDING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF BRAWN AND COLD PIES WHERE RIOTOUS BOYS WERE HOLDING HIGH REVEL THE WHOLE COMPLETED BY A ROARING CHRISTMAS FIRE WHICH SEEMED DETERMINED TO BE HEARD IN SPITE OF ALL THE NOISE OF THE OTHERS
1421-8534-0036 CHARLES AND MARY ALSO CAME IN OF COURSE DURING THEIR VISIT AND MISTER MUSGROVE MADE A POINT OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO LADY RUSSELL AND SAT DOWN CLOSE TO HER FOR TEN MINUTES TALKING WITH A VERY RAISED VOICE BUT FROM THE CLAMOUR OF THE CHILDREN ON HIS KNEES GENERALLY IN VAIN IT WAS A FINE FAMILY PIECE
1421-8534-0037 WOULD HAVE DEEMED SUCH A DOMESTIC HURRICANE A BAD RESTORATIVE OF THE NERVES WHICH LOUISA'S ILLNESS MUST HAVE SO GREATLY SHAKEN BUT MISSUS MUSGROVE WHO GOT ANNE NEAR HER ON PURPOSE TO THANK HER MOST CORDIALLY AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR ALL HER ATTENTIONS TO THEM
1421-8534-0038 CONCLUDED A SHORT RECAPITULATION OF WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED HERSELF BY OBSERVING WITH A HAPPY GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM THAT AFTER ALL SHE HAD GONE THROUGH NOTHING WAS SO LIKELY TO DO HER GOOD AS A LITTLE QUIET CHEERFULNESS AT HOME LOUISA WAS NOW RECOVERING APACE
1421-8534-0039 THE HARVILLES HAD PROMISED TO COME WITH HER AND STAY AT UPPERCROSS WHENEVER SHE RETURNED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS GONE FOR THE PRESENT TO SEE HIS BROTHER IN SHROPSHIRE I HOPE I SHALL REMEMBER IN FUTURE SAID LADY RUSSELL AS SOON AS THEY WERE RESEATED IN THE CARRIAGE NOT TO CALL AT UPPERCROSS IN THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS
1421-8534-0040 EVERYBODY HAS THEIR TASTE IN NOISES AS WELL AS IN OTHER MATTERS AND SOUNDS ARE QUITE INNOXIOUS OR MOST DISTRESSING BY THEIR SORT RATHER THAN THEIR QUANTITY WHEN LADY RUSSELL NOT LONG AFTERWARDS WAS ENTERING BATH ON A WET AFTERNOON
1421-8534-0041 AND DRIVING THROUGH THE LONG COURSE OF STREETS FROM THE OLD BRIDGE TO CAMDEN PLACE AMIDST THE DASH OF OTHER CARRIAGES THE HEAVY RUMBLE OF CARTS AND DRAYS THE BAWLING OF NEWSPAPERMEN MUFFIN MEN AND MILKMEN AND THE CEASELESS CLINK OF PATTENS SHE MADE NO COMPLAINT NO
1421-8534-0042 THESE WERE NOISES WHICH BELONGED TO THE WINTER PLEASURES HER SPIRITS ROSE UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE AND LIKE MISSUS MUSGROVE SHE WAS FEELING THOUGH NOT SAYING THAT AFTER BEING LONG IN THE COUNTRY NOTHING COULD BE SO GOOD FOR HER AS A LITTLE QUIET CHEERFULNESS
1421-8534-0043 ANNE DID NOT SHARE THESE FEELINGS SHE PERSISTED IN A VERY DETERMINED THOUGH VERY SILENT DISINCLINATION FOR BATH CAUGHT THE FIRST DIM VIEW OF THE EXTENSIVE BUILDINGS SMOKING IN RAIN WITHOUT ANY WISH OF SEEING THEM BETTER
1421-8534-0044 FELT THEIR PROGRESS THROUGH THE STREETS TO BE HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE YET TOO RAPID FOR WHO WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND LOOKED BACK WITH FOND REGRET TO THE BUSTLES OF UPPERCROSS AND THE SECLUSION OF KELLYNCH
1421-8534-0045 ELIZABETH'S LAST LETTER HAD COMMUNICATED A PIECE OF NEWS OF SOME INTEREST MISTER ELLIOT WAS IN BATH HE HAD CALLED IN CAMDEN PLACE HAD CALLED A SECOND TIME A THIRD HAD BEEN POINTEDLY ATTENTIVE IF ELIZABETH AND HER FATHER DID NOT DECEIVE THEMSELVES
1421-8534-0046 HAD BEEN TAKING MUCH PAINS TO SEEK THE ACQUAINTANCE AND PROCLAIM THE VALUE OF THE CONNECTION AS HE HAD FORMERLY TAKEN PAINS TO SHEW NEGLECT THIS WAS VERY WONDERFUL IF IT WERE TRUE AND LADY RUSSELL WAS IN A STATE OF VERY AGREEABLE CURIOSITY AND PERPLEXITY ABOUT MISTER ELLIOT
1421-8534-0047 OF HIS BEING A MAN WHOM SHE HAD NO WISH TO SEE SHE HAD A GREAT WISH TO SEE HIM
1421-8534-0048 HE MUST BE FORGIVEN FOR HAVING DISMEMBERED HIMSELF FROM THE PATERNAL TREE ANNE WAS NOT ANIMATED TO AN EQUAL PITCH BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT SHE FELT THAT SHE WOULD RATHER SEE MISTER ELLIOT AGAIN THAN NOT WHICH WAS MORE THAN SHE COULD SAY FOR MANY OTHER PERSONS IN BATH
