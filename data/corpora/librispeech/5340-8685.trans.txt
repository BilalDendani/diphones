5340-8685-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED AN OLD MAN WHO HAD ONLY ONE SON WHOM HE LOVED DEARLY BUT THEY WERE VERY POOR AND OFTEN HAD SCARCELY ENOUGH TO EAT THEN THE OLD MAN FELL ILL AND THINGS GREW WORSE THAN EVER
5340-8685-0001 SO HE CALLED HIS SON AND SAID TO HIM MY DEAR BOY I HAVE NO LONGER ANY FOOD TO GIVE YOU AND YOU MUST GO INTO THE WORLD AND GET IT FOR YOURSELF IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT WORK YOU DO BUT REMEMBER
5340-8685-0002 IF YOU DO IT WELL AND ARE FAITHFUL TO YOUR MASTER YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR REWARD SO PETER PUT A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD IN HIS KNAPSACK AND STRAPPING IT ON HIS BACK TOOK A STOUT STICK IN HIS HAND AND SET OUT TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE
5340-8685-0003 FOR A LONG WHILE HE TRAVELLED ON AND ON AND NOBODY SEEMED TO WANT HIM BUT ONE DAY HE MET AN OLD MAN AND BEING A POLITE YOUTH HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND SAID GOOD MORNING IN A PLEASANT VOICE
5340-8685-0004 AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING I AM WANDERING THROUGH THE COUNTRY TRYING TO GET WORK REPLIED PETER THEN STAY WITH ME FOR I CAN GIVE YOU PLENTY SAID THE OLD MAN AND PETER STAYED HIS WORK DID NOT SEEM HARD
5340-8685-0005 FOR HE HAD ONLY TWO HORSES AND A COW TO SEE AFTER AND THOUGH HE HAD BEEN HIRED FOR A YEAR THE YEAR CONSISTED OF BUT THREE DAYS SO THAT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE RECEIVED HIS WAGES IN PAYMENT THE OLD MAN GAVE HIM A NUT
5340-8685-0006 AND OFFERED TO KEEP HIM FOR ANOTHER YEAR BUT PETER WAS HOME SICK AND BESIDES HE WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN PAID EVER SO SMALL A PIECE OF MONEY THAN A NUT FOR THOUGHT HE NUTS GROW ON EVERY TREE AND I CAN GATHER AS MANY AS I LIKE HOWEVER
5340-8685-0007 HE DID NOT SAY THIS TO THE OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN KIND TO HIM BUT JUST BADE HIM FAREWELL THE NEARER PETER DREW TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE THE MORE ASHAMED HE FELT AT HAVING BROUGHT BACK SUCH POOR WAGES WHAT COULD ONE NUT DO FOR HIM
5340-8685-0008 WHY IT WOULD NOT BUY EVEN A SLICE OF BACON IT WAS NO USE TAKING IT HOME HE MIGHT AS WELL EAT IT SO HE SAT DOWN ON A STONE AND CRACKED IT WITH HIS TEETH AND THEN TOOK IT OUT OF HIS MOUTH TO BREAK OFF THE SHELL
5340-8685-0009 HORSES AND OXEN AND SHEEP STEPPED OUT IN SUCH NUMBERS THAT THEY SEEMED AS IF THEY WOULD STRETCH TO THE WORLD'S END
5340-8685-0010 WHAT WAS HE TO DO WITH ALL THESE CREATURES WHERE WAS HE TO PUT THEM
5340-8685-0011 THE OLD MAN COULD NOT BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW THE MULTITUDES OF HORSES OXEN AND SHEEP STANDING BEFORE HIS DOOR HOW DID YOU COME BY ALL THESE HE GASPED AS SOON AS HE COULD SPEAK AND THE SON TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY
5340-8685-0012 AND OF THE PROMISE HE HAD GIVEN EISENKOPF THE NEXT DAY SOME OF THE CATTLE WERE DRIVEN TO MARKET AND SOLD AND WITH THE MONEY THE OLD MAN WAS ABLE TO BUY SOME OF THE FIELDS AND GARDENS ROUND HIS HOUSE
5340-8685-0013 TILL ONE DAY WHEN HE AND HIS SON WERE SITTING IN THE ORCHARD WATCHING THEIR HERDS OF CATTLE GRAZING IN THE MEADOWS HE SUDDENLY SAID PETER MY BOY IT IS TIME THAT YOU WERE THINKING OF MARRYING BUT MY DEAR FATHER I TOLD YOU I CAN NEVER MARRY
5340-8685-0014 BECAUSE OF THE PROMISE I GAVE TO EISENKOPF OH ONE PROMISES HERE AND PROMISES THERE BUT NO ONE EVER THINKS OF KEEPING SUCH PROMISES IF EISENKOPF DOES NOT LIKE YOUR MARRYING HE WILL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT ALL THE SAME
5340-8685-0015 BESIDES THERE STANDS IN THE STABLE A GREY HORSE WHICH IS SADDLED NIGHT AND DAY AND IF EISENKOPF SHOULD SHOW HIS FACE YOU HAVE ONLY GOT TO JUMP ON THE HORSE'S BACK AND RIDE AWAY AND NOBODY ON EARTH CAN CATCH YOU WHEN ALL IS SAFE YOU WILL COME BACK AGAIN
5340-8685-0016 AND SO IT ALL HAPPENED THE YOUNG MAN FOUND A PRETTY BROWN SKINNED GIRL WHO WAS WILLING TO HAVE HIM FOR A HUSBAND AND THE WHOLE VILLAGE CAME TO THE WEDDING FEAST THE MUSIC WAS AT ITS GAYEST AND THE DANCE AT ITS MERRIEST
5340-8685-0017 WHEN EISENKOPF LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOW OH HO MY BROTHER WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IT HAS THE AIR OF BEING A WEDDING FEAST YET I FANCIED WAS I MISTAKEN
5340-8685-0018 BUT PETER HAD NOT WAITED FOR THE END OF THIS SPEECH SCARCELY HAD HE SEEN EISENKOPF THAN HE DARTED LIKE THE WIND TO THE STABLE AND FLUNG HIMSELF ON THE HORSE'S BACK IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE WAS AWAY OVER THE MOUNTAIN
5340-8685-0019 WITH EISENKOPF RUNNING FAST BEHIND HIM ON THEY WENT THROUGH THICK FORESTS WHERE THE SUN NEVER SHONE OVER RIVERS SO WIDE THAT IT TOOK A WHOLE DAY TO SAIL ACROSS THEM UP HILLS WHOSE SIDES WERE ALL OF GLASS
5340-8685-0020 ON THEY WENT THROUGH SEVEN TIMES SEVEN COUNTRIES TILL PETER REINED IN HIS HORSE BEFORE THE HOUSE OF AN OLD WOMAN GOOD DAY MOTHER SAID HE JUMPING DOWN AND OPENING THE DOOR GOOD DAY MY SON ANSWERED SHE
