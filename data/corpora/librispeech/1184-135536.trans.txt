1184-135536-0000 TO THE DAY'S END IT WAS INDEED HIGH TIME FOR THEM TO RUN
1184-135536-0001 SOME BEING BETTER RUNNERS OR HAVING OPEN GROUND TO RUN UPON HAD FAR OUTSTRIPPED THE OTHERS AND WERE ALREADY CLOSE UPON THE GOAL SOME FOLLOWING VALLEYS
1184-135536-0002 AND OUTFLANKED THE LADS ON EITHER SIDE DICK PLUNGED INTO THE NEAREST COVER IT WAS A TALL GROVE OF OAKS FIRM UNDER FOOT AND CLEAR OF UNDERBRUSH AND AS IT LAY DOWN HILL THEY MADE GOOD SPEED THERE FOLLOWED NEXT A PIECE OF OPEN
1184-135536-0003 WHICH DICK AVOIDED HOLDING TO HIS LEFT TWO MINUTES AFTER AND THE SAME OBSTACLE ARISING THE LADS FOLLOWED THE SAME COURSE THUS IT FOLLOWED THAT WHILE THE LADS BENDING CONTINUALLY TO THE LEFT DREW NEARER AND NEARER TO THE HIGH ROAD AND THE RIVER
1184-135536-0004 WHICH THEY HAD CROSSED AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE THE GREAT BULK OF THEIR PURSUERS WERE LEANING TO THE OTHER HAND AND RUNNING TOWARDS TUNSTALL THE LADS PAUSED TO BREATHE THERE WAS NO SOUND OF PURSUIT DICK PUT HIS EAR TO THE GROUND
1184-135536-0005 ON AGAIN SAID DICK AND TIRED AS THEY WERE AND MATCHAM LIMPING WITH HIS INJURED FOOT THEY PULLED THEMSELVES TOGETHER AND ONCE MORE PELTED DOWN THE HILL THREE MINUTES LATER THEY WERE BREASTING THROUGH A LOW THICKET OF EVERGREEN HIGH OVERHEAD
1184-135536-0006 THE TALL TREES MADE A CONTINUOUS ROOF OF FOLIAGE IT WAS A PILLARED GROVE AS HIGH AS A CATHEDRAL AND EXCEPT FOR THE HOLLIES AMONG WHICH THE LADS WERE STRUGGLING OPEN AND SMOOTHLY SWARDED ON THE OTHER SIDE PUSHING THROUGH THE LAST FRINGE OF EVERGREEN
1184-135536-0007 THEY BLUNDERED FORTH AGAIN INTO THE OPEN TWILIGHT OF THE GROVE STAND CRIED A VOICE AND THERE BETWEEN THE HUGE STEMS NOT FIFTY FEET BEFORE THEM THEY BEHELD A STOUT FELLOW IN GREEN SORE BLOWN WITH RUNNING WHO INSTANTLY DREW AN ARROW TO THE HEAD
1184-135536-0008 AND COVERED THEM MATCHAM STOPPED WITH A CRY BUT DICK WITHOUT A PAUSE RAN STRAIGHT UPON THE FORESTER DRAWING HIS DAGGER AS HE WENT THE OTHER WHETHER HE WAS STARTLED BY THE DARING OF THE ONSLAUGHT OR WHETHER HE WAS HAMPERED BY HIS ORDERS DID NOT SHOOT
1184-135536-0009 HE STOOD WAVERING AND BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO COME TO HIMSELF DICK BOUNDED AT HIS THROAT AND SENT HIM SPRAWLING BACKWARD ON THE TURF
1184-135536-0010 THE DISARMED FORESTER GRAPPLED HIS ASSAILANT BUT THE DAGGER SHONE AND DESCENDED TWICE THEN CAME A COUPLE OF GROANS
1184-135536-0011 STABBED TO THE HEART ON
1184-135536-0012 MATCHAM TRAILING IN THE REAR TO SAY TRUTH THEY MADE BUT POOR SPEED OF IT BY NOW LABOURING DISMALLY AS THEY RAN AND CATCHING FOR THEIR BREATH LIKE FISH MATCHAM HAD A CRUEL STITCH AND HIS HEAD SWAM AND AS FOR DICK HIS KNEES WERE LIKE LEAD
1184-135536-0013 BUT THEY KEPT UP THE FORM OF RUNNING WITH UNDIMINISHED COURAGE PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO THE END OF THE GROVE IT STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND THERE A FEW YARDS BEFORE THEM WAS THE HIGH ROAD FROM RISINGHAM TO SHOREBY LYING AT THIS POINT
1184-135536-0014 BETWEEN TWO EVEN WALLS OF FOREST AT THE SIGHT DICK PAUSED AND AS SOON AS HE STOPPED RUNNING HE BECAME AWARE OF A CONFUSED NOISE WHICH RAPIDLY GREW LOUDER IT WAS AT FIRST LIKE THE RUSH OF A VERY HIGH GUST OF WIND
1184-135536-0015 BUT SOON IT BECAME MORE DEFINITE AND RESOLVED ITSELF INTO THE GALLOPING OF HORSES AND THEN IN A FLASH
1184-135536-0016 SWEPT BEFORE THE LADS AND WERE GONE AGAIN UPON THE INSTANT THEY RODE AS FOR THEIR LIVES IN COMPLETE DISORDER SOME OF THEM WERE WOUNDED RIDERLESS HORSES GALLOPED AT THEIR SIDE WITH BLOODY SADDLES THEY WERE PLAINLY FUGITIVES FROM THE GREAT BATTLE
1184-135536-0017 THE NOISE OF THEIR PASSAGE HAD SCARCE BEGUN TO DIE AWAY TOWARDS SHOREBY BEFORE FRESH HOOFS CAME ECHOING IN THEIR WAKE AND ANOTHER DESERTER CLATTERED DOWN THE ROAD THIS TIME A SINGLE RIDER AND BY HIS SPLENDID ARMOUR A MAN OF HIGH DEGREE CLOSE AFTER HIM
1184-135536-0018 THERE FOLLOWED SEVERAL BAGGAGE WAGGONS FLEEING AT AN UNGAINLY CANTER THE DRIVERS FLAILING AT THE HORSES AS IF FOR LIFE THESE MUST HAVE RUN EARLY IN THE DAY BUT THEIR COWARDICE WAS NOT TO SAVE THEM FOR JUST BEFORE THEY CAME ABREAST OF WHERE THE LADS STOOD WONDERING
1184-135536-0019 A MAN IN HACKED ARMOUR AND SEEMINGLY BESIDE HIMSELF WITH FURY OVERTOOK THE WAGGONS AND WITH THE TRUNCHEON OF A SWORD BEGAN TO CUT THE DRIVERS DOWN SOME LEAPED FROM THEIR PLACES AND PLUNGED INTO THE WOOD THE OTHERS HE SABRED AS THEY SAT
