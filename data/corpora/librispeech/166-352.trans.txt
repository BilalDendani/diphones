166-352-0000 WITH AN ANXIETY THAT ALMOST AMOUNTED TO AGONY I COLLECTED THE INSTRUMENTS OF LIFE AROUND ME THAT I MIGHT INFUSE A SPARK OF BEING INTO THE LIFELESS THING THAT LAY AT MY FEET IT WAS ALREADY ONE IN THE MORNING
166-352-0001 THE RAIN PATTERED DISMALLY AGAINST THE PANES AND MY CANDLE WAS NEARLY BURNT OUT WHEN BY THE GLIMMER OF THE HALF EXTINGUISHED LIGHT I SAW THE DULL YELLOW EYE OF THE CREATURE OPEN IT BREATHED HARD
166-352-0002 AND A CONVULSIVE MOTION AGITATED ITS LIMBS HOW CAN I DESCRIBE MY EMOTIONS AT THIS CATASTROPHE OR HOW DELINEATE THE WRETCH WHOM WITH SUCH INFINITE PAINS AND CARE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO FORM
166-352-0003 HIS LIMBS WERE IN PROPORTION AND I HAD SELECTED HIS FEATURES AS BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL GREAT GOD HIS YELLOW SKIN SCARCELY COVERED THE WORK OF MUSCLES AND ARTERIES BENEATH
166-352-0004 HIS HAIR WAS OF A LUSTROUS BLACK AND FLOWING HIS TEETH OF A PEARLY WHITENESS BUT THESE LUXURIANCES ONLY FORMED A MORE HORRID CONTRAST WITH HIS WATERY EYES
166-352-0005 FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INFUSING LIFE INTO AN INANIMATE BODY FOR THIS I HAD DEPRIVED MYSELF OF REST AND HEALTH I HAD DESIRED IT WITH AN ARDOUR THAT FAR EXCEEDED MODERATION
166-352-0006 HER FEATURES APPEARED TO CHANGE AND I THOUGHT THAT I HELD THE CORPSE OF MY DEAD MOTHER IN MY ARMS A SHROUD ENVELOPED HER FORM AND I SAW THE GRAVE WORMS CRAWLING IN THE FOLDS OF THE FLANNEL I STARTED FROM MY SLEEP WITH HORROR
166-352-0007 AND HE MUTTERED SOME INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHILE A GRIN WRINKLED HIS CHEEKS HE MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN BUT I DID NOT HEAR ONE HAND WAS STRETCHED OUT SEEMINGLY TO DETAIN ME
166-352-0008 BUT I ESCAPED AND RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS I TOOK REFUGE IN THE COURTYARD BELONGING TO THE HOUSE WHICH I INHABITED WHERE I REMAINED DURING THE REST OF THE NIGHT WALKING UP AND DOWN IN THE GREATEST AGITATION
166-352-0009 LISTENING ATTENTIVELY CATCHING AND FEARING EACH SOUND AS IF IT WERE TO ANNOUNCE THE APPROACH OF THE DEMONIACAL CORPSE TO WHICH I HAD SO MISERABLY GIVEN LIFE OH NO MORTAL COULD SUPPORT THE HORROR OF THAT COUNTENANCE
166-352-0010 A MUMMY AGAIN ENDUED WITH ANIMATION COULD NOT BE SO HIDEOUS AS THAT WRETCH I HAD GAZED ON HIM WHILE UNFINISHED HE WAS UGLY THEN BUT WHEN THOSE MUSCLES AND JOINTS WERE RENDERED CAPABLE OF MOTION
166-352-0011 AT OTHERS I NEARLY SANK TO THE GROUND THROUGH LANGUOR AND EXTREME WEAKNESS MINGLED WITH THIS HORROR I FELT THE BITTERNESS OF DISAPPOINTMENT
166-352-0012 AND DISCOVERED TO MY SLEEPLESS AND ACHING EYES THE CHURCH OF INGOLSTADT ITS WHITE STEEPLE AND CLOCK WHICH INDICATED THE SIXTH HOUR THE PORTER OPENED THE GATES OF THE COURT WHICH HAD THAT NIGHT BEEN MY ASYLUM AND I ISSUED INTO THE STREETS
166-352-0013 PACING THEM WITH QUICK STEPS AS IF I SOUGHT TO AVOID THE WRETCH WHOM I FEARED EVERY TURNING OF THE STREET WOULD PRESENT TO MY VIEW I DID NOT DARE RETURN TO THE APARTMENT WHICH I INHABITED BUT FELT IMPELLED TO HURRY ON
166-352-0014 COLERIDGE'S ANCIENT MARINER CONTINUING THUS I CAME AT LENGTH OPPOSITE TO THE INN AT WHICH THE VARIOUS DILIGENCES AND CARRIAGES USUALLY STOPPED HERE I PAUSED I KNEW NOT WHY
166-352-0015 BUT I REMAINED SOME MINUTES WITH MY EYES FIXED ON A COACH THAT WAS COMING TOWARDS ME FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STREET AS IT DREW NEARER I OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE SWISS DILIGENCE
166-352-0016 IT STOPPED JUST WHERE I WAS STANDING AND ON THE DOOR BEING OPENED I PERCEIVED HENRY CLERVAL WHO ON SEEING ME INSTANTLY SPRUNG OUT MY DEAR FRANKENSTEIN EXCLAIMED HE HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU
166-352-0017 HOW FORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE AT THE VERY MOMENT OF MY ALIGHTING NOTHING COULD EQUAL MY DELIGHT ON SEEING CLERVAL HIS PRESENCE BROUGHT BACK TO MY THOUGHTS MY FATHER ELIZABETH
166-352-0018 AND ALL THOSE SCENES OF HOME SO DEAR TO MY RECOLLECTION I GRASPED HIS HAND AND IN A MOMENT FORGOT MY HORROR AND MISFORTUNE I FELT SUDDENLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING MANY MONTHS CALM AND SERENE JOY
166-352-0019 I BELIEVE I LEFT HIM INCREDULOUS TO THE LAST FOR HIS CONSTANT ANSWER TO MY UNWEARIED ENTREATIES WAS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE DUTCH SCHOOLMASTER IN THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD I HAVE TEN THOUSAND FLORINS A YEAR WITHOUT GREEK
166-352-0020 BUT TELL ME HOW YOU LEFT MY FATHER BROTHERS AND ELIZABETH VERY WELL AND VERY HAPPY ONLY A LITTLE UNEASY THAT THEY HEAR FROM YOU SO SELDOM BY THE BY I MEAN TO LECTURE YOU A LITTLE UPON THEIR ACCOUNT MYSELF
166-352-0021 I DID NOT BEFORE REMARK HOW VERY ILL YOU APPEAR SO THIN AND PALE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD BEEN WATCHING FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS YOU HAVE GUESSED RIGHT
166-352-0022 I HAVE LATELY BEEN SO DEEPLY ENGAGED IN ONE OCCUPATION THAT I HAVE NOT ALLOWED MYSELF SUFFICIENT REST AS YOU SEE BUT I HOPE I SINCERELY HOPE THAT ALL THESE EMPLOYMENTS ARE NOW AT AN END
166-352-0023 AND THAT I AM AT LENGTH FREE I TREMBLED EXCESSIVELY I COULD NOT ENDURE TO THINK OF AND FAR LESS TO ALLUDE TO THE OCCURRENCES OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT I WALKED WITH A QUICK PACE
166-352-0024 AND WE SOON ARRIVED AT MY COLLEGE I THEN REFLECTED AND THE THOUGHT MADE ME SHIVER THAT THE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LEFT IN MY APARTMENT MIGHT STILL BE THERE ALIVE AND WALKING ABOUT
166-352-0025 I DREADED TO BEHOLD THIS MONSTER BUT I FEARED STILL MORE THAT HENRY SHOULD SEE HIM ENTREATING HIM THEREFORE TO REMAIN A FEW MINUTES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS I DARTED UP TOWARDS MY OWN ROOM
166-352-0026 I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT SO GREAT A GOOD FORTUNE COULD HAVE BEFALLEN ME BUT WHEN I BECAME ASSURED THAT MY ENEMY HAD INDEED FLED I CLAPPED MY HANDS FOR JOY AND RAN DOWN TO CLERVAL
166-352-0027 WE ASCENDED INTO MY ROOM AND THE SERVANT PRESENTLY BROUGHT BREAKFAST BUT I WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF IT WAS NOT JOY ONLY THAT POSSESSED ME
166-352-0028 I FELT MY FLESH TINGLE WITH EXCESS OF SENSITIVENESS AND MY PULSE BEAT RAPIDLY I WAS UNABLE TO REMAIN FOR A SINGLE INSTANT IN THE SAME PLACE I JUMPED OVER THE CHAIRS CLAPPED MY HANDS AND LAUGHED ALOUD
166-352-0029 CLERVAL AT FIRST ATTRIBUTED MY UNUSUAL SPIRITS TO JOY ON HIS ARRIVAL BUT WHEN HE OBSERVED ME MORE ATTENTIVELY HE SAW A WILDNESS IN MY EYES FOR WHICH HE COULD NOT ACCOUNT
166-352-0030 AND MY LOUD UNRESTRAINED HEARTLESS LAUGHTER FRIGHTENED AND ASTONISHED HIM MY DEAR VICTOR CRIED HE WHAT FOR GOD'S SAKE IS THE MATTER DO NOT LAUGH IN THAT MANNER HOW ILL YOU ARE
166-352-0031 DO NOT ASK ME CRIED I PUTTING MY HANDS BEFORE MY EYES FOR I THOUGHT I SAW THE DREADED SPECTRE GLIDE INTO THE ROOM HE CAN TELL OH SAVE ME SAVE ME
166-352-0032 I IMAGINED THAT THE MONSTER SEIZED ME I STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY AND FELL DOWN IN A FIT POOR CLERVAL WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS FEELINGS A MEETING WHICH HE ANTICIPATED WITH SUCH JOY
166-352-0033 SO STRANGELY TURNED TO BITTERNESS BUT I WAS NOT THE WITNESS OF HIS GRIEF FOR I WAS LIFELESS AND DID NOT RECOVER MY SENSES FOR A LONG LONG TIME
166-352-0034 I AFTERWARDS LEARNED THAT KNOWING MY FATHER'S ADVANCED AGE AND UNFITNESS FOR SO LONG A JOURNEY AND HOW WRETCHED MY SICKNESS WOULD MAKE ELIZABETH HE SPARED THEM THIS GRIEF BY CONCEALING THE EXTENT OF MY DISORDER
166-352-0035 HE KNEW THAT I COULD NOT HAVE A MORE KIND AND ATTENTIVE NURSE THAN HIMSELF AND FIRM IN THE HOPE HE FELT OF MY RECOVERY HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT INSTEAD OF DOING HARM
166-352-0036 HE PERFORMED THE KINDEST ACTION THAT HE COULD TOWARDS THEM BUT I WAS IN REALITY VERY ILL AND SURELY NOTHING BUT THE UNBOUNDED AND UNREMITTING ATTENTIONS OF MY FRIEND COULD HAVE RESTORED ME TO LIFE
166-352-0037 THE FORM OF THE MONSTER ON WHOM I HAD BESTOWED EXISTENCE WAS FOREVER BEFORE MY EYES AND I RAVED INCESSANTLY CONCERNING HIM DOUBTLESS MY WORDS SURPRISED HENRY
166-352-0038 HE AT FIRST BELIEVED THEM TO BE THE WANDERINGS OF MY DISTURBED IMAGINATION BUT THE PERTINACITY WITH WHICH I CONTINUALLY RECURRED TO THE SAME SUBJECT PERSUADED HIM THAT MY DISORDER INDEED OWED ITS ORIGIN TO SOME UNCOMMON AND TERRIBLE
166-352-0039 I PERCEIVED THAT THE FALLEN LEAVES HAD DISAPPEARED AND THAT THE YOUNG BUDS WERE SHOOTING FORTH FROM THE TREES THAT SHADED MY WINDOW IT WAS A DIVINE SPRING AND THE SEASON CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO MY CONVALESCENCE
166-352-0040 I FELT ALSO SENTIMENTS OF JOY AND AFFECTION REVIVE IN MY BOSOM MY GLOOM DISAPPEARED AND IN A SHORT TIME I BECAME AS CHEERFUL AS BEFORE I WAS ATTACKED BY THE FATAL PASSION
166-352-0041 HOW KIND HOW VERY GOOD YOU ARE TO ME THIS WHOLE WINTER INSTEAD OF BEING SPENT IN STUDY AS YOU PROMISED YOURSELF HAS BEEN CONSUMED IN MY SICK ROOM HOW SHALL I EVER REPAY YOU
166-352-0042 I FEEL THE GREATEST REMORSE FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN THE OCCASION BUT YOU WILL FORGIVE ME YOU WILL REPAY ME ENTIRELY IF YOU DO NOT DISCOMPOSE YOURSELF BUT GET WELL AS FAST AS YOU CAN
166-352-0043 AND SINCE YOU APPEAR IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS I MAY SPEAK TO YOU ON ONE SUBJECT MAY I NOT I TREMBLED ONE SUBJECT WHAT COULD IT BE
166-352-0044 COULD HE ALLUDE TO AN OBJECT ON WHOM I DARED NOT EVEN THINK COMPOSE YOURSELF SAID CLERVAL WHO OBSERVED MY CHANGE OF COLOUR I WILL NOT MENTION IT IF IT AGITATES YOU
