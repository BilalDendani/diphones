102-129232-0000 AND SHAKSPEARE'S STRAIN ONE HISTORY THERE IS ONE MIND COMMON TO ALL INDIVIDUAL MEN EVERY MAN IS AN INLET TO THE SAME AND TO ALL OF THE SAME
102-129232-0001 HE THAT IS ONCE ADMITTED TO THE RIGHT OF REASON IS MADE A FREEMAN OF THE WHOLE ESTATE WHAT PLATO HAS THOUGHT HE MAY THINK WHAT A SAINT HAS FELT HE MAY FEEL
102-129232-0002 FOR THIS IS THE ONLY AND SOVEREIGN AGENT OF THE WORKS OF THIS MIND HISTORY IS THE RECORD ITS GENIUS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE ENTIRE SERIES OF DAYS
102-129232-0003 MAN IS EXPLICABLE BY NOTHING LESS THAN ALL HIS HISTORY WITHOUT HURRY WITHOUT REST THE HUMAN SPIRIT GOES FORTH FROM THE BEGINNING TO EMBODY EVERY FACULTY
102-129232-0004 EVERY THOUGHT EVERY EMOTION WHICH BELONGS TO IT IN APPROPRIATE EVENTS BUT THE THOUGHT IS ALWAYS PRIOR TO THE FACT
102-129232-0005 ALL THE FACTS OF HISTORY PREEXIST IN THE MIND AS LAWS EACH LAW IN TURN IS MADE BY CIRCUMSTANCES PREDOMINANT AND THE LIMITS OF NATURE GIVE POWER TO BUT ONE AT A TIME
102-129232-0006 AND THIS MUST READ IT THE SPHINX MUST SOLVE HER OWN RIDDLE IF THE WHOLE OF HISTORY IS IN ONE MAN IT IS ALL TO BE EXPLAINED FROM INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE
102-129232-0007 THERE IS A RELATION BETWEEN THE HOURS OF OUR LIFE AND THE CENTURIES OF TIME AS THE AIR I BREATHE IS DRAWN FROM THE GREAT REPOSITORIES OF NATURE
102-129232-0008 EVERY REVOLUTION WAS FIRST A THOUGHT IN ONE MAN'S MIND AND WHEN THE SAME THOUGHT OCCURS TO ANOTHER MAN IT IS THE KEY TO THAT ERA EVERY REFORM WAS ONCE A PRIVATE OPINION
102-129232-0009 AND WHEN IT SHALL BE A PRIVATE OPINION AGAIN IT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE AGE THE FACT NARRATED MUST CORRESPOND TO SOMETHING IN ME TO BE CREDIBLE OR INTELLIGIBLE
102-129232-0010 WE AS WE READ MUST BECOME GREEKS ROMANS TURKS PRIEST AND KING MARTYR AND EXECUTIONER
102-129232-0011 MUST FASTEN THESE IMAGES TO SOME REALITY IN OUR SECRET EXPERIENCE OR WE SHALL LEARN NOTHING RIGHTLY WHAT BEFELL ASDRUBAL OR CAESAR BORGIA
102-129232-0012 IS AS MUCH AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE MIND'S POWERS AND DEPRAVATIONS AS WHAT HAS BEFALLEN US EACH NEW LAW AND POLITICAL MOVEMENT HAS MEANING FOR YOU STAND BEFORE EACH OF ITS TABLETS AND SAY
102-129232-0013 UNDER THIS MASK DID MY PROTEUS NATURE HIDE ITSELF THIS REMEDIES THE DEFECT OF OUR TOO GREAT NEARNESS TO OURSELVES THIS THROWS OUR ACTIONS INTO PERSPECTIVE
102-129232-0014 AND AS CRABS GOATS SCORPIONS THE BALANCE AND THE WATERPOT LOSE THEIR MEANNESS WHEN HUNG AS SIGNS IN THE ZODIAC SO I CAN SEE MY OWN VICES WITHOUT HEAT
102-129232-0015 AND WE HEDGE IT ROUND WITH PENALTIES AND LAWS ALL LAWS DERIVE HENCE THEIR ULTIMATE REASON ALL EXPRESS MORE OR LESS DISTINCTLY SOME COMMAND OF THIS SUPREME ILLIMITABLE ESSENCE
102-129232-0016 PROPERTY ALSO HOLDS OF THE SOUL COVERS GREAT SPIRITUAL FACTS AND INSTINCTIVELY WE AT FIRST HOLD TO IT WITH SWORDS AND LAWS AND WIDE AND COMPLEX COMBINATIONS
102-129232-0017 WHICH BELONG TO ACTS OF SELF RELIANCE IT IS REMARKABLE THAT INVOLUNTARILY WE ALWAYS READ AS SUPERIOR BEINGS UNIVERSAL HISTORY THE POETS THE ROMANCERS
102-129232-0018 DO NOT IN THEIR STATELIEST PICTURES IN THE SACERDOTAL THE IMPERIAL PALACES IN THE TRIUMPHS OF WILL OR OF GENIUS ANYWHERE LOSE OUR EAR
102-129232-0019 YONDER SLIP OF A BOY THAT READS IN THE CORNER FEELS TO BE TRUE OF HIMSELF WE SYMPATHIZE IN THE GREAT MOMENTS OF HISTORY IN THE GREAT DISCOVERIES THE GREAT RESISTANCES
102-129232-0020 THE GREAT PROSPERITIES OF MEN BECAUSE THERE LAW WAS ENACTED THE SEA WAS SEARCHED THE LAND WAS FOUND OR THE BLOW WAS STRUCK
102-129232-0021 AS WE OURSELVES IN THAT PLACE WOULD HAVE DONE OR APPLAUDED WE HAVE THE SAME INTEREST IN CONDITION AND CHARACTER
102-129232-0022 POWER AND GRACE WHICH WE FEEL TO BE PROPER TO MAN PROPER TO US SO ALL THAT IS SAID OF THE WISE MAN BY STOIC OR ORIENTAL OR MODERN ESSAYIST
102-129232-0023 DESCRIBES TO EACH READER HIS OWN IDEA DESCRIBES HIS UNATTAINED BUT ATTAINABLE SELF ALL LITERATURE WRITES THE CHARACTER OF THE WISE MAN BOOKS
102-129232-0024 AS BY PERSONAL ALLUSIONS A TRUE ASPIRANT THEREFORE NEVER NEEDS LOOK FOR ALLUSIONS PERSONAL AND LAUDATORY IN DISCOURSE HE HEARS THE COMMENDATION
102-129232-0025 NOT OF HIMSELF BUT MORE SWEET OF THAT CHARACTER HE SEEKS IN EVERY WORD THAT IS SAID CONCERNING CHARACTER YEA FURTHER IN EVERY FACT AND CIRCUMSTANCE
102-129232-0026 THESE HINTS DROPPED AS IT WERE FROM SLEEP AND NIGHT LET US USE IN BROAD DAY THE STUDENT IS TO READ HISTORY ACTIVELY AND NOT PASSIVELY
102-129232-0027 THERE IS NO AGE OR STATE OF SOCIETY OR MODE OF ACTION IN HISTORY TO WHICH THERE IS NOT SOMEWHAT CORRESPONDING IN HIS LIFE EVERY THING TENDS IN A WONDERFUL MANNER TO ABBREVIATE ITSELF
102-129232-0028 AND YIELD ITS OWN VIRTUE TO HIM HE SHOULD SEE THAT HE CAN LIVE ALL HISTORY IN HIS OWN PERSON HE MUST SIT SOLIDLY AT HOME AND NOT SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE BULLIED BY KINGS OR EMPIRES
102-129232-0029 BUT KNOW THAT HE IS GREATER THAN ALL THE GEOGRAPHY AND ALL THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD
102-129232-0030 FROM ROME AND ATHENS AND LONDON TO HIMSELF AND NOT DENY HIS CONVICTION THAT HE IS THE COURT AND IF ENGLAND OR EGYPT HAVE ANY THING TO SAY TO HIM HE WILL TRY THE CASE
102-129232-0031 BABYLON TROY TYRE PALESTINE AND EVEN EARLY ROME ARE PASSING ALREADY INTO FICTION THE GARDEN OF EDEN THE SUN STANDING STILL IN GIBEON
102-129232-0032 IS POETRY THENCEFORWARD TO ALL NATIONS WHO CARES WHAT THE FACT WAS WHEN WE HAVE MADE A CONSTELLATION OF IT TO HANG IN HEAVEN AN IMMORTAL SIGN LONDON AND PARIS AND NEW YORK MUST GO THE SAME WAY
102-129232-0033 WHAT IS HISTORY SAID NAPOLEON BUT A FABLE AGREED UPON THIS LIFE OF OURS IS STUCK ROUND WITH EGYPT GREECE GAUL ENGLAND WAR COLONIZATION CHURCH COURT AND COMMERCE
102-129232-0034 I WILL NOT MAKE MORE ACCOUNT OF THEM I BELIEVE IN ETERNITY I CAN FIND GREECE ASIA ITALY SPAIN AND THE ISLANDS
102-129232-0035 IN MY OWN MIND WE ARE ALWAYS COMING UP WITH THE EMPHATIC FACTS OF HISTORY IN OUR PRIVATE EXPERIENCE AND VERIFYING THEM HERE ALL HISTORY BECOMES SUBJECTIVE IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS PROPERLY
102-129232-0036 THE BETTER FOR HIM HISTORY MUST BE THIS OR IT IS NOTHING EVERY LAW WHICH THE STATE ENACTS INDICATES A FACT IN HUMAN NATURE THAT IS ALL
102-129232-0037 BEFORE A FRENCH REIGN OF TERROR AND A SALEM HANGING OF WITCHES BEFORE A FANATIC REVIVAL AND THE ANIMAL MAGNETISM IN PARIS OR IN PROVIDENCE
102-129232-0038 WE ASSUME THAT WE UNDER LIKE INFLUENCE SHOULD BE ALIKE AFFECTED AND SHOULD ACHIEVE THE LIKE
102-129232-0039 OUR PROXY HAS DONE ALL INQUIRY INTO ANTIQUITY
102-129232-0040 STONEHENGE THE OHIO CIRCLES MEXICO MEMPHIS IS THE DESIRE TO DO AWAY THIS WILD SAVAGE AND PREPOSTEROUS THERE OR THEN AND INTRODUCE IN ITS PLACE THE HERE AND THE NOW
102-129232-0041 BELZONI DIGS AND MEASURES IN THE MUMMY PITS AND PYRAMIDS OF THEBES UNTIL HE CAN SEE THE END OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MONSTROUS WORK AND HIMSELF
102-129232-0042 WHEN HE HAS SATISFIED HIMSELF IN GENERAL AND IN DETAIL THAT IT WAS MADE BY SUCH A PERSON AS HE SO ARMED AND SO MOTIVED
102-129232-0043 HIS THOUGHT LIVES ALONG THE WHOLE LINE OF TEMPLES AND SPHINXES AND CATACOMBS PASSES THROUGH THEM ALL WITH SATISFACTION AND THEY LIVE AGAIN TO THE MIND OR ARE NOW
102-129232-0044 A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL AFFIRMS THAT IT WAS DONE BY US AND NOT DONE BY US SURELY IT WAS BY MAN BUT WE FIND IT NOT IN OUR MAN BUT WE APPLY OURSELVES TO THE HISTORY OF ITS PRODUCTION
102-129232-0045 WE PUT OURSELVES INTO THE PLACE AND STATE OF THE BUILDER WE REMEMBER THE FOREST DWELLERS THE FIRST TEMPLES THE ADHERENCE TO THE FIRST TYPE AND THE DECORATION OF IT AS THE WEALTH OF THE NATION INCREASED
102-129232-0046 THE VALUE WHICH IS GIVEN TO WOOD BY CARVING LED TO THE CARVING OVER THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN OF STONE OF A CATHEDRAL WHEN WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS
102-129232-0047 WE HAVE AS IT WERE BEEN THE MAN THAT MADE THE MINSTER WE HAVE SEEN HOW IT COULD AND MUST BE WE HAVE THE SUFFICIENT REASON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN IS IN THEIR PRINCIPLE OF ASSOCIATION
102-129232-0048 SOME MEN CLASSIFY OBJECTS BY COLOR AND SIZE AND OTHER ACCIDENTS OF APPEARANCE OTHERS BY INTRINSIC LIKENESS OR BY THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT
102-129232-0049 ALL EVENTS PROFITABLE ALL DAYS HOLY ALL MEN DIVINE FOR THE EYE IS FASTENED ON THE LIFE AND SLIGHTS THE CIRCUMSTANCE EVERY CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
102-129232-0050 EVERY PLANT EVERY ANIMAL IN ITS GROWTH TEACHES THE UNITY OF CAUSE THE VARIETY OF APPEARANCE UPBORNE AND SURROUNDED AS WE ARE BY THIS ALL CREATING NATURE
102-129232-0051 SOFT AND FLUID AS A CLOUD OR THE AIR WHY SHOULD WE BE SUCH HARD PEDANTS AND MAGNIFY A FEW FORMS WHY SHOULD WE MAKE ACCOUNT OF TIME OR OF MAGNITUDE OR OF FIGURE THE SOUL KNOWS THEM NOT
102-129232-0052 AND GENIUS OBEYING ITS LAW KNOWS HOW TO PLAY WITH THEM AS A YOUNG CHILD PLAYS WITH GRAYBEARDS AND IN CHURCHES
102-129232-0053 AND FAR BACK IN THE WOMB OF THINGS SEES THE RAYS PARTING FROM ONE ORB
102-129232-0054 BY INFINITE DIAMETERS GENIUS WATCHES THE MONAD THROUGH ALL HIS MASKS AS HE PERFORMS THE METEMPSYCHOSIS OF NATURE GENIUS DETECTS THROUGH THE FLY THROUGH THE CATERPILLAR
102-129232-0055 THROUGH THE GRUB THROUGH THE EGG THE CONSTANT INDIVIDUAL THROUGH COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS THE FIXED SPECIES THROUGH MANY SPECIES THE GENUS THROUGH ALL GENERA THE STEADFAST TYPE
102-129232-0056 THROUGH ALL THE KINGDOMS OF ORGANIZED LIFE THE ETERNAL UNITY NATURE IS A MUTABLE CLOUD WHICH IS ALWAYS AND NEVER THE SAME SHE CASTS THE SAME THOUGHT INTO TROOPS OF FORMS
102-129232-0057 AND WHILST I LOOK AT IT ITS OUTLINE AND TEXTURE ARE CHANGED AGAIN NOTHING IS SO FLEETING AS FORM YET NEVER DOES IT QUITE DENY ITSELF
102-129232-0058 IN MAN WE STILL TRACE THE REMAINS OR HINTS OF ALL THAT WE ESTEEM BADGES OF SERVITUDE IN THE LOWER RACES YET IN HIM THEY ENHANCE HIS NOBLENESS AND GRACE
102-129232-0059 A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WITH NOTHING OF THE METAMORPHOSIS LEFT BUT THE LUNAR HORNS AS THE SPLENDID ORNAMENT OF HER BROWS THE IDENTITY OF HISTORY IS EQUALLY INTRINSIC THE DIVERSITY EQUALLY OBVIOUS
102-129232-0060 AND WHAT THEY DID WE HAVE THE SAME NATIONAL MIND EXPRESSED FOR US AGAIN IN THEIR LITERATURE IN EPIC AND LYRIC POEMS
102-129232-0061 AND NEVER TRANSGRESSING THE IDEAL SERENITY LIKE VOTARIES PERFORMING SOME RELIGIOUS DANCE BEFORE THE GODS AND THOUGH IN CONVULSIVE PAIN OR MORTAL COMBAT NEVER DARING TO BREAK THE FIGURE AND DECORUM OF THEIR DANCE
102-129232-0062 EVERY ONE MUST HAVE OBSERVED FACES AND FORMS WHICH WITHOUT ANY RESEMBLING FEATURE MAKE A LIKE IMPRESSION ON THE BEHOLDER
102-129232-0063 WILL YET SUPERINDUCE THE SAME SENTIMENT
102-129232-0064 BUT IS OCCULT AND OUT OF THE REACH OF THE UNDERSTANDING NATURE IS AN ENDLESS COMBINATION AND REPETITION OF A VERY FEW LAWS SHE HUMS THE OLD WELL KNOWN AIR THROUGH INNUMERABLE VARIATIONS
102-129232-0065 NATURE IS FULL OF A SUBLIME FAMILY LIKENESS
102-129232-0066 AND THE FURROWS OF THE BROW SUGGESTED THE STRATA OF THE ROCK THERE ARE MEN WHOSE MANNERS HAVE THE SAME ESSENTIAL SPLENDOR AS THE SIMPLE AND AWFUL SCULPTURE ON THE FRIEZES OF THE PARTHENON AND THE REMAINS OF THE EARLIEST GREEK ART
102-129232-0067 AND THERE ARE COMPOSITIONS OF THE SAME STRAIN TO BE FOUND IN THE BOOKS OF ALL AGES WHAT IS GUIDO'S ROSPIGLIOSI AURORA BUT A MORNING THOUGHT AS THE HORSES IN IT ARE ONLY A MORNING CLOUD IF ANY ONE WILL BUT TAKE PAINS TO OBSERVE THE VARIETY OF ACTIONS
102-129232-0068 OR DRAW A CHILD BY STUDYING THE OUTLINES OF ITS FORM MERELY
102-129232-0069 IT IS THE SPIRIT AND NOT THE FACT THAT IS IDENTICAL BY A DEEPER APPREHENSION
102-129232-0070 IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT COMMON SOULS PAY WITH WHAT THEY DO NOBLER SOULS WITH THAT WHICH THEY ARE AND WHY BECAUSE A PROFOUND NATURE AWAKENS IN US BY ITS ACTIONS AND WORDS BY ITS VERY LOOKS AND MANNERS
102-129232-0071 SANTA CROCE AND THE DOME OF SAINT PETER'S
102-129232-0072 SHALL PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME WITH ALL THE ORNAMENT THAT TITLES OF NOBILITY COULD EVER ADD THE TRIVIAL EXPERIENCE OF EVERY DAY IS ALWAYS VERIFYING SOME OLD PREDICTION TO US AND CONVERTING INTO THINGS THE WORDS AND SIGNS
102-129232-0073 WHICH WE HAD HEARD AND SEEN WITHOUT HEED A LADY WITH WHOM I WAS RIDING IN THE FOREST SAID TO ME THAT THE WOODS ALWAYS SEEMED TO HER TO WAIT
102-129232-0074 IN THE FIELDS MY COMPANION POINTED OUT TO ME A BROAD CLOUD WHICH MIGHT EXTEND A QUARTER OF A MILE PARALLEL TO THE HORIZON
102-129232-0075 WHICH IT WAS EASY TO ANIMATE WITH EYES AND MOUTH
102-129232-0076 WHAT APPEARS ONCE IN THE ATMOSPHERE MAY APPEAR OFTEN AND IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE ARCHETYPE OF THAT FAMILIAR ORNAMENT I HAVE SEEN IN THE SKY A CHAIN OF SUMMER LIGHTNING
102-129232-0077 WHICH AT ONCE SHOWED TO ME THAT THE GREEKS DREW FROM NATURE WHEN THEY PAINTED THE THUNDERBOLT IN THE HAND OF JOVE
102-129232-0078 ALONG THE SIDES OF THE STONE WALL WHICH OBVIOUSLY GAVE THE IDEA OF THE COMMON ARCHITECTURAL SCROLL
102-129232-0079 BY SURROUNDING OURSELVES WITH THE ORIGINAL CIRCUMSTANCES WE INVENT ANEW THE ORDERS AND THE ORNAMENTS OF ARCHITECTURE
102-129232-0080 STILL BETRAY THE MOUNDS AND SUBTERRANEAN HOUSES OF THEIR FOREFATHERS
102-129232-0081 SAYS HEEREN IN HIS RESEARCHES ON THE ETHIOPIANS DETERMINED VERY NATURALLY THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTER OF THE NUBIAN EGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE TO THE COLOSSAL FORM WHICH IT ASSUMED
102-129232-0082 SO THAT WHEN ART CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF NATURE IT COULD NOT MOVE ON A SMALL SCALE WITHOUT DEGRADING ITSELF WHAT WOULD STATUES OF THE USUAL SIZE OR NEAT PORCHES AND WINGS HAVE BEEN
102-129232-0083 THE GOTHIC CHURCH PLAINLY ORIGINATED IN A RUDE ADAPTATION OF THE FOREST TREES
102-129232-0084 STILL INDICATE THE GREEN WITHES THAT TIED THEM NO ONE CAN WALK IN A ROAD
102-129232-0085 ESPECIALLY IN WINTER WHEN THE BARRENNESS OF ALL OTHER TREES SHOWS THE LOW ARCH OF THE SAXONS IN THE WOODS IN A WINTER AFTERNOON ONE WILL SEE AS READILY THE ORIGIN OF THE STAINED GLASS WINDOW
102-129232-0086 ENTER THE OLD PILES OF OXFORD AND THE ENGLISH CATHEDRALS WITHOUT FEELING THAT THE FOREST OVERPOWERED THE MIND OF THE BUILDER AND THAT HIS CHISEL HIS SAW AND PLANE STILL REPRODUCED ITS FERNS ITS SPIKES OF FLOWERS ITS LOCUST
102-129232-0087 ELM OAK PINE FIR AND SPRUCE THE GOTHIC CATHEDRAL
102-129232-0088 AS WELL AS THE AERIAL PROPORTIONS AND PERSPECTIVE OF VEGETABLE BEAUTY IN LIKE MANNER ALL PUBLIC FACTS ARE TO BE INDIVIDUALIZED ALL PRIVATE FACTS ARE TO BE GENERALIZED THEN AT ONCE HISTORY BECOMES FLUID AND TRUE
102-129232-0089 SO THE PERSIAN COURT IN ITS MAGNIFICENT ERA
102-129232-0090 TO SUSA IN SUMMER AND TO BABYLON FOR THE WINTER
102-129232-0091 NOMADISM AND AGRICULTURE ARE THE TWO ANTAGONIST FACTS THE GEOGRAPHY OF ASIA AND OF AFRICA
102-129232-0092 OR THE ADVANTAGES OF A MARKET HAD INDUCED TO BUILD TOWNS AGRICULTURE THEREFORE WAS A RELIGIOUS INJUNCTION BECAUSE OF THE PERILS OF THE STATE FROM NOMADISM AND IN THESE LATE AND CIVIL COUNTRIES OF ENGLAND AND AMERICA
102-129232-0093 THESE PROPENSITIES STILL FIGHT OUT THE OLD BATTLE IN THE NATION AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL THE NOMADS OF AFRICA WERE CONSTRAINED TO WANDER BY THE ATTACKS OF THE GAD FLY
102-129232-0094 FOLLOW THE PASTURAGE FROM MONTH TO MONTH
102-129232-0095 THE NOMADISM IS OF TRADE AND CURIOSITY A PROGRESS CERTAINLY
102-129232-0096 SACRED CITIES TO WHICH A PERIODICAL RELIGIOUS PILGRIMAGE WAS ENJOINED OR STRINGENT LAWS AND CUSTOMS TENDING TO INVIGORATE THE NATIONAL BOND
102-129232-0097 A MAN OF RUDE HEALTH AND FLOWING SPIRITS HAS THE FACULTY OF RAPID DOMESTICATION LIVES IN HIS WAGON AND ROAMS THROUGH ALL LATITUDES AS EASILY AS A CALMUC AT SEA OR IN THE FOREST OR IN THE SNOW HE SLEEPS AS WARM
102-129232-0098 OR PERHAPS HIS FACILITY IS DEEPER SEATED IN THE INCREASED RANGE OF HIS FACULTIES OF OBSERVATION
102-129232-0099 AND THIS INTELLECTUAL NOMADISM
102-129232-0100 IS THAT CONTINENCE OR CONTENT WHICH FINDS ALL THE ELEMENTS OF LIFE IN ITS OWN SOIL AND
102-129232-0101 IF NOT STIMULATED BY FOREIGN INFUSIONS
102-129232-0102 DOWN TO THE DOMESTIC LIFE OF THE ATHENIANS AND SPARTANS FOUR OR FIVE CENTURIES LATER WHAT BUT THIS
102-129232-0103 THE GRECIAN STATE IS THE ERA OF THE BODILY NATURE
102-129232-0104 IN IT EXISTED THOSE HUMAN FORMS WHICH SUPPLIED THE SCULPTOR WITH HIS MODELS OF HERCULES PHOEBUS AND JOVE
102-129232-0105 SHARPLY DEFINED AND SYMMETRICAL FEATURES WHOSE EYE SOCKETS ARE SO FORMED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH EYES TO SQUINT AND TAKE FURTIVE GLANCES ON THIS SIDE AND ON THAT BUT THEY MUST TURN THE WHOLE HEAD THE MANNERS OF THAT PERIOD ARE PLAIN AND FIERCE
102-129232-0106 THE REVERENCE EXHIBITED IS FOR PERSONAL QUALITIES COURAGE ADDRESS SELF COMMAND JUSTICE STRENGTH SWIFTNESS A LOUD VOICE A BROAD CHEST
102-129232-0107 COOK BUTCHER AND SOLDIER AND THE HABIT OF SUPPLYING HIS OWN NEEDS EDUCATES THE BODY TO WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES
102-129232-0108 THROUGHOUT HIS ARMY EXISTS A BOUNDLESS LIBERTY OF SPEECH THEY QUARREL FOR PLUNDER THEY WRANGLE WITH THE GENERALS ON EACH NEW ORDER AND XENOPHON IS AS SHARP TONGUED AS ANY AND SHARPER TONGUED THAN MOST AND SO GIVES AS GOOD AS HE GETS
102-129232-0109 WHO DOES NOT SEE THAT THIS IS A GANG OF GREAT BOYS WITH SUCH A CODE OF HONOR AND SUCH LAX DISCIPLINE AS GREAT BOYS HAVE THE COSTLY CHARM OF THE ANCIENT TRAGEDY AND INDEED OF ALL THE OLD LITERATURE IS THAT THE PERSONS SPEAK SIMPLY
102-129232-0110 OUR ADMIRATION OF THE ANTIQUE IS NOT ADMIRATION OF THE OLD BUT OF THE NATURAL
102-129232-0111 THEY COMBINE THE ENERGY OF MANHOOD WITH THE ENGAGING UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF CHILDHOOD THE ATTRACTION OF THESE MANNERS IS THAT THEY BELONG TO MAN AND ARE KNOWN TO EVERY MAN IN VIRTUE OF HIS BEING ONCE A CHILD
102-129232-0112 BESIDES THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS INDIVIDUALS WHO RETAIN THESE CHARACTERISTICS A PERSON OF CHILDLIKE GENIUS AND INBORN ENERGY
102-129232-0113 IN READING THOSE FINE APOSTROPHES TO SLEEP TO THE STARS ROCKS MOUNTAINS AND WAVES I FEEL TIME PASSING AWAY AS AN EBBING SEA I FEEL THE ETERNITY OF MAN THE IDENTITY OF HIS THOUGHT THE GREEK HAD IT SEEMS
102-129232-0114 AND DO AS IT WERE RUN INTO ONE WHY SHOULD I MEASURE DEGREES OF LATITUDE WHY SHOULD I COUNT EGYPTIAN YEARS THE STUDENT INTERPRETS THE AGE OF CHIVALRY BY HIS OWN AGE OF CHIVALRY AND THE DAYS OF MARITIME ADVENTURE
102-129232-0115 MERELY ECHOES TO HIM A SENTIMENT OF HIS INFANCY A PRAYER OF HIS YOUTH HE THEN PIERCES TO THE TRUTH THROUGH ALL THE CONFUSION OF TRADITION AND THE CARICATURE OF INSTITUTIONS RARE EXTRAVAGANT SPIRITS COME BY US AT INTERVALS
102-129232-0116 HENCE EVIDENTLY THE TRIPOD THE PRIEST THE PRIESTESS INSPIRED BY THE DIVINE AFFLATUS JESUS ASTONISHES AND OVERPOWERS SENSUAL PEOPLE THEY CANNOT UNITE HIM TO HISTORY OR RECONCILE HIM WITH THEMSELVES
102-129232-0117 THEIR OWN PIETY EXPLAINS EVERY FACT EVERY WORD HOW EASILY THESE OLD WORSHIPS OF MOSES OF ZOROASTER OF MENU OF SOCRATES DOMESTICATE THEMSELVES IN THE MIND I CANNOT FIND ANY ANTIQUITY IN THEM
102-129232-0118 MORE THAN ONCE SOME INDIVIDUAL HAS APPEARED TO ME WITH SUCH NEGLIGENCE OF LABOR AND SUCH COMMANDING CONTEMPLATION A HAUGHTY BENEFICIARY BEGGING IN THE NAME OF GOD AS MADE GOOD TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SIMEON THE STYLITE
102-129232-0119 IS EXPOUNDED IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S PRIVATE LIFE THE CRAMPING INFLUENCE OF A HARD FORMALIST ON A YOUNG CHILD IN REPRESSING HIS SPIRITS AND COURAGE
102-129232-0120 EXPLAINED TO THE CHILD WHEN HE BECOMES A MAN ONLY BY SEEING THAT THE OPPRESSOR OF HIS YOUTH IS HIMSELF A CHILD TYRANNIZED OVER BY THOSE NAMES AND WORDS AND FORMS OF WHOSE INFLUENCE HE WAS MERELY THE ORGAN TO THE YOUTH
102-129232-0121 WAS WORSHIPPED AND HOW THE PYRAMIDS WERE BUILT BETTER THAN THE DISCOVERY BY CHAMPOLLION OF THE NAMES OF ALL THE WORKMEN AND THE COST OF EVERY TILE HE FINDS ASSYRIA AND THE MOUNDS OF CHOLULA AT HIS DOOR AND HIMSELF HAS LAID THE COURSES
102-129232-0122 NEW PERILS TO VIRTUE HE LEARNS AGAIN WHAT MORAL VIGOR IS NEEDED TO SUPPLY THE GIRDLE OF A SUPERSTITION A GREAT LICENTIOUSNESS TREADS ON THE HEELS OF A REFORMATION
102-129232-0123 DOCTOR SAID HIS WIFE TO MARTIN LUTHER ONE DAY
102-129232-0124 WHILST NOW WE PRAY WITH THE UTMOST COLDNESS AND VERY SELDOM
102-129232-0125 HIS OWN SECRET BIOGRAPHY HE FINDS IN LINES WONDERFULLY INTELLIGIBLE TO HIM DOTTED DOWN BEFORE HE WAS BORN ONE AFTER ANOTHER HE COMES UP IN HIS PRIVATE ADVENTURES WITH EVERY FABLE OF AESOP OF HOMER OF HAFIZ
102-129232-0126 AND VERIFIES THEM WITH HIS OWN HEAD AND HANDS THE BEAUTIFUL FABLES OF THE GREEKS BEING PROPER CREATIONS OF THE IMAGINATION AND NOT OF THE FANCY ARE UNIVERSAL VERITIES WHAT A RANGE OF MEANINGS AND WHAT PERPETUAL PERTINENCE HAS THE STORY OF PROMETHEUS
102-129232-0127 WITH SOME CLOSENESS TO THE FAITH OF LATER AGES PROMETHEUS IS THE JESUS OF THE OLD MYTHOLOGY HE IS THE FRIEND OF MAN STANDS BETWEEN THE UNJUST JUSTICE OF THE ETERNAL FATHER AND THE RACE OF MORTALS
102-129232-0128 AND READILY SUFFERS ALL THINGS ON THEIR ACCOUNT
102-129232-0129 NAMELY A DISCONTENT WITH THE BELIEVED FACT THAT A GOD EXISTS AND A FEELING THAT THE OBLIGATION OF REVERENCE IS ONEROUS
102-129232-0130 AND LIVE APART FROM HIM AND INDEPENDENT OF HIM THE PROMETHEUS VINCTUS IS THE ROMANCE OF SKEPTICISM NOT LESS TRUE TO ALL TIME ARE THE DETAILS OF THAT STATELY APOLOGUE
102-129232-0131 WHEN THE GODS COME AMONG MEN THEY ARE NOT KNOWN JESUS WAS NOT SOCRATES AND SHAKSPEARE WERE NOT ANTAEUS WAS SUFFOCATED BY THE GRIPE OF HERCULES BUT EVERY TIME HE TOUCHED HIS MOTHER EARTH HIS STRENGTH WAS RENEWED
102-129232-0132 ARE INVIGORATED BY HABITS OF CONVERSATION WITH NATURE THE POWER OF MUSIC THE POWER OF POETRY TO UNFIX AND AS IT WERE CLAP WINGS TO SOLID NATURE INTERPRETS THE RIDDLE OF ORPHEUS
102-129232-0133 WHAT ELSE AM I WHO LAUGHED OR WEPT YESTERDAY WHO SLEPT LAST NIGHT LIKE A CORPSE
102-129232-0134 TANTALUS IS BUT A NAME FOR YOU AND ME TANTALUS MEANS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DRINKING THE WATERS OF THOUGHT WHICH ARE ALWAYS GLEAMING AND WAVING WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SOUL THE TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS IS NO FABLE I WOULD IT WERE BUT MEN AND WOMEN ARE ONLY HALF HUMAN

102-129232-0137 SERVE THEM FACTS ENCUMBER THEM TYRANNIZE OVER THEM AND MAKE THE MEN OF ROUTINE THE MEN OF SENSE IN WHOM A LITERAL OBEDIENCE TO FACTS HAS EXTINGUISHED EVERY SPARK OF THAT LIGHT BY WHICH MAN IS TRULY MAN
102-129232-0138 SEE IN GOETHE'S HELENA THE SAME DESIRE THAT EVERY WORD SHOULD BE A THING THESE FIGURES HE WOULD SAY
102-129232-0139 PHORKYAS HELEN AND LEDA ARE SOMEWHAT AND DO EXERT A SPECIFIC INFLUENCE ON THE MIND SO FAR THEN ARE THEY ETERNAL ENTITIES AS REAL TO DAY AS IN THE FIRST OLYMPIAD
102-129232-0140 AND ALTHOUGH THAT POEM BE AS VAGUE AND FANTASTIC AS A DREAM YET IS IT MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN THE MORE REGULAR DRAMATIC PIECES OF THE SAME AUTHOR FOR THE REASON THAT IT OPERATES A WONDERFUL RELIEF TO THE MIND FROM THE ROUTINE OF CUSTOMARY IMAGES
102-129232-0141 AWAKENS THE READER'S INVENTION AND FANCY
102-129232-0142 OF THAT WHICH IN GRAVE EARNEST THE MIND OF THAT PERIOD TOILED TO ACHIEVE MAGIC AND ALL THAT IS ASCRIBED TO IT
102-129232-0143 THE SHOES OF SWIFTNESS THE SWORD OF SHARPNESS THE POWER OF SUBDUING THE ELEMENTS OF USING THE SECRET VIRTUES OF MINERALS
102-129232-0144 THE GIFT OF PERPETUAL YOUTH AND THE LIKE ARE ALIKE THE ENDEAVOUR OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT TO BEND THE SHOWS OF THINGS TO THE DESIRES OF THE MIND IN PERCEFOREST AND AMADIS DE GAUL A GARLAND AND A ROSE BLOOM ON THE HEAD OF HER WHO IS FAITHFUL
102-129232-0145 AT THE TRIUMPH OF THE GENTLE VENELAS AND INDEED ALL THE POSTULATES OF ELFIN ANNALS THAT THE FAIRIES DO NOT LIKE TO BE NAMED THAT THEIR GIFTS ARE CAPRICIOUS AND NOT TO BE TRUSTED THAT WHO SEEKS A TREASURE MUST NOT SPEAK AND THE LIKE
