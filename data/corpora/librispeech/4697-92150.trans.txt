4697-92150-0000 BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO SUPPOSE THAT IT IS NOT ALSO QUITE APPARENT TO ME I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT NEITHER I IMAGINE HAS TOBY TO ME THERE ARE ONLY TWO KINDS OF HORSE
4697-92150-0001 CHESTNUTS ROANS BAY RUMS I KNOW NOTHING OF ALL THESE I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE A HORSE SIMPLY AS A NICE HORSE OR A NASTY HORSE TOBY IS A NICE HORSE
4697-92150-0002 TOBY OF COURSE KNOWS MUCH MORE ABOUT MEN THAN I DO ABOUT HORSES AND NO DOUBT HE DESCRIBES ME PROFESSIONALLY TO HIS COLLEAGUES AS A FLEA BITTEN FELLOW STANDING ABOUT EIGHTEEN HOOFS
4697-92150-0003 I LIKE TO THINK THAT HE SUMS ME UP TO HIMSELF AS A NICE MAN AT ANY RATE I AM NOT ALLOWED TO WEAR SPURS AND THAT MUST WEIGH WITH A HORSE A GOOD DEAL I HAVE NO REAL RIGHT TO TOBY
4697-92150-0004 THE SIGNALLING OFFICER'S OFFICIAL MOUNT IS A BICYCLE BUT A BICYCLE IN THIS WEATHER
4697-92150-0005 IT WOULD ONLY CAUSE JEALOUSY IF ONE OF THEM RODE HIM AND WHY WOULD IT CREATE MORE JEALOUSY THAN IF YOU DO ASKED ONE OF THEM WELL I SAID YOU'RE THE OFFICER COMMANDING PLATOON NUMBER
4697-92150-0006 FIFTEEN FIFTEEN NOW WHY SHOULD THE OFFICER COMMANDING THE FIFTEENTH PLATOON RIDE A HORSE WHEN THE OFFICER COMMANDING THE NINETEENTH HE REMINDED ME THAT THERE WERE ONLY SIXTEEN PLATOONS IN A BATTALION
4697-92150-0007 IT'S SUCH A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLATOONS THAT I FORGET ALL RIGHT WE'LL SAY THE SIXTEENTH WHY SHOULDN'T HE HAVE A HORSE OF ALL THE UNJUST WELL
4697-92150-0008 YOU SEE WHAT RECRIMINATIONS IT WOULD LEAD TO NOW I DON'T SAY I'M MORE VALUABLE THAN A PLATOON COMMANDER OR MORE EFFECTIVE ON A HORSE BUT AT ANY RATE THERE AREN'T SIXTEEN OF ME THERE'S ONLY ONE SIGNALLING OFFICER
4697-92150-0009 AND IF THERE IS A SPARE HORSE OVER WHAT ABOUT THE BOMBING OFFICER SAID O C PLATOON FIFTEEN CARELESSLY I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE BOMBING OFFICER OF COURSE HE IS A SPECIALIST TOO
4697-92150-0010 I SAID THINKING HARD ALL THE TIME YOU WOULD WELL PUT IT THIS WAY THE RANGE OF A MILLS BOMB IS ABOUT FIFTY YARDS THE RANGE OF A FIELD TELEPHONE IS SEVERAL MILES
4697-92150-0011 WHICH OF US IS MORE LIKELY TO REQUIRE A HORSE AND THE SNIPING OFFICER HE WENT ON DREAMILY THIS ANNOYED ME YOU DON'T SHOOT SNIPE FROM HORSEBACK
4697-92150-0012 I SAID SHARPLY YOU'RE MIXING UP SHOOTING AND HUNTING MY LAD AND IN ANY CASE THERE ARE REASONS SPECIAL REASONS WHY I RIDE TOBY REASONS OF WHICH YOU KNOW NOTHING HERE ARE THE REASONS
4697-92150-0013 ONE I THINK I HAVE MORE CLAIM TO A HORSE CALLED TOBY THAN HAS A CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR FEATHERED FRIENDS OR WHATEVER PAPER THE SNIPING OFFICER WRITES FOR TWO
4697-92150-0014 WHEN I JOINED THE ARMY CELIA WAS INCONSOLABLE I BEGGED HER TO KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP TO WHICH SHE REPLIED THAT SHE COULD DO IT BETTER IF I PROMISED NOT TO KEEP A BRISTLY ONE
4697-92150-0015 I POINTED OUT THAT THE COUNTRY WANTED BRISTLES AND THOUGH BETWEEN OURSELVES WE MIGHT REGARD IT AS A PROMISING FACE SPOILT FOR A TRADITION STILL DISCIPLINE WAS DISCIPLINE
4697-92150-0016 AND SO THE BRISTLES CAME AND REMAINED UNTIL THE HAPPY DAY WHEN THE WAR OFFICE AT THE RISK OF LOSING THE WAR MADE THEM OPTIONAL IMMEDIATELY THEY WERE UPROOTED
4697-92150-0017 NOW THE COLONEL HAS ONLY ONE FAULT I HAVE BEEN DEFINITELY PROMISED MY SECOND STAR IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN SO HE WON'T THINK I AM FLATTERING HIM WITH A PURPOSE
4697-92150-0018 HE LIKES MOUSTACHES HIS OWN IS ADMIRABLE AND I HAVE NO WISH FOR HIM TO REMOVE IT BUT I THINK HE SHOULD BE EQUALLY BROAD MINDED ABOUT MINE YOU AREN'T REALLY MORE BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT IT
4697-92150-0019 HE SAID A MOUSTACHE SUITS YOU MY WIFE DOESN'T THINK SO I SAID FIRMLY I HAD THE WAR OFFICE ON MY SIDE SO I COULD AFFORD TO BE FIRM THE COLONEL LOOKED AT ME
4697-92150-0020 AND THEN HE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND MADE THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE STATEMENT TOBY HE SAID GENTLY TO HIMSELF DOESN'T LIKE CLEAN SHAVEN OFFICERS
4697-92150-0021 THIS HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME I LET IT SINK IN OF COURSE I SAID AT LAST ONE MUST CONSIDER ONE'S HORSE I QUITE SEE THAT WITH A BICYCLE
4697-92150-0022 HE SAID IT'S DIFFERENT AND SO THERE YOU HAVE THE SECOND REASON IF THE BOMBING OFFICER RODE TOBY I SHOULD SHAVE AGAIN TO MORROW AND THEN WHERE WOULD THE BATTALION BE RUINED
4697-92150-0023 SO TOBY AND I GO OFF TOGETHER UP TILL NOW HE HAS BEEN GOOD TO ME HE HAS BITTEN ONE COMPANY COMMANDER REMOVED ANOTHER AND LED THE COLONEL A THREE MILE CHASE ACROSS COUNTRY AFTER HIM
4697-92150-0024 SO IF ANY MISUNDERSTANDING OCCURS BETWEEN US THERE WILL BE GOOD PRECEDENT FOR IT SO FAR MY ONLY REAL TROUBLE HAS BEEN ONCE WHEN BILLETING
4697-92150-0025 BILLETING IS DELIGHTFUL FUN
4697-92150-0026 I SAY NOTHING OF THE RESULT BUT FOR REASONS CONNECTED WITH TOBY I HOPE HE WON'T COME AGAIN FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF A NARROW STREET CROWDED WITH LORRIES HE JUMPED OFF HIS HORSE FLUNG I THINK THAT'S THE EXPRESSION
4697-92150-0027 FLUNG ME THE REINS AND SAID
4697-92150-0028 THE MAJOR'S HORSE I CAN DESCRIBE QUITE SHORTLY A NASTY BIG BLACK HORSE TOBY
4697-92150-0029 BUT HE HAD BEEN KNEE DEEP IN MUD INSPECTING HUTS FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR AND WAS SICK OF BILLETING I NEED NOT DESCRIBE TWO HUNDRED LORRIES ON A DARK EVENING TO YOU AND SO SEEING THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUENTS
4697-92150-0030 I MUST LET YOU IMAGINE HOW THEY ALL MIXED THIS IS A BEASTLY WAR BUT IT HAS ITS TIMES
4697-92150-0031 I DOUBT IF EVEN IN ENGLAND WHICH SEEMS VERY FAR OFF YOU WILL FIND TWO PEOPLE MORE CONTENTED WITH THE MORNING THAN TOBY AND I
