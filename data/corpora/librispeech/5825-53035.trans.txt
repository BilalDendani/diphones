5825-53035-0000 FORTUNE SHOWED ITSELF STRANGELY FAVOURABLE TO THE PLANS OF NAHOON AND NANEA ONE OF THE ZULU CAPTAIN'S PERPLEXITIES WAS AS TO HOW HE SHOULD LULL THE SUSPICIONS AND EVADE THE VIGILANCE OF HIS OWN COMPANIONS
5825-53035-0001 WHO TOGETHER WITH HIMSELF HAD BEEN DETAILED BY THE KING TO ASSIST HADDEN IN HIS HUNTING AND TO GUARD AGAINST HIS ESCAPE AS IT CHANCED HOWEVER ON THE DAY AFTER THE INCIDENT OF THE VISIT OF MAPUTA
5825-53035-0002 WHICH WAS TO BE PLACED UPON FULL WAR FOOTING ACCORDINGLY
5825-53035-0003 TO ALLOW OF HIS TRAVELLING FAST AND FAR SO THE SOLDIERS WENT DOUBTING NOTHING
5825-53035-0004 TAKING WITH HIM HIS DAUGHTER NANEA
5825-53035-0005 AND ALSO THOSE FIFTEEN HEAD OF CATTLE THAT HAD BEEN LOBOLA'D BY NAHOON IN CONSIDERATION OF HIS FORTHCOMING MARRIAGE
5825-53035-0006 UNDER PRETENCE THAT THEY REQUIRED A CHANGE OF VELDT
5825-53035-0007 TELLING HIM TO KEEP THEM BY THE CROCODILE DRIFT AS THERE THE GRASS WAS GOOD AND SWEET ALL PREPARATIONS BEING COMPLETED ON THE THIRD DAY THE PARTY STARTED HEADING STRAIGHT FOR ULUNDI
5825-53035-0008 AFTER THEY HAD TRAVELLED SOME MILES HOWEVER THEY LEFT THE ROAD AND TURNING SHARP TO THE RIGHT PASSED UNOBSERVED OF ANY THROUGH A GREAT STRETCH OF UNINHABITED BUSH THEIR PATH NOW LAY NOT FAR FROM THE POOL OF DOOM
5825-53035-0009 WHICH INDEED WAS CLOSE TO UMGONA'S KRAAL AND THE FOREST THAT WAS CALLED HOME OF THE DEAD BUT OUT OF SIGHT OF THESE IT WAS THEIR PLAN TO TRAVEL BY NIGHT REACHING THE BROKEN COUNTRY NEAR THE CROCODILE DRIFT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
5825-53035-0010 HERE THEY PROPOSED TO LIE HID THAT DAY AND THROUGH THE NIGHT THEN HAVING FIRST COLLECTED THE CATTLE WHICH HAD PRECEDED THEM TO CROSS THE RIVER AT THE BREAK OF DAWN AND ESCAPE INTO NATAL AT LEAST THIS WAS THE PLAN OF HIS COMPANIONS
5825-53035-0011 WHEREON AFTER ONE LAST APPEARANCE TWO OF THE PARTY WOULD PLAY NO PART DURING THAT LONG AFTERNOON'S JOURNEY UMGONA WHO KNEW EVERY INCH OF THE COUNTRY
5825-53035-0012 HADDEN WHO BROUGHT UP THE REAR NOTICED THAT THE GIRL SEEMED TO BE UNDER THE SPELL OF AN IMMINENT APPREHENSION FOR FROM TIME TO TIME SHE CLASPED HER LOVER'S ARM AND LOOKING UP INTO HIS FACE ADDRESSED HIM WITH VEHEMENCE
5825-53035-0013 ALMOST WITH PASSION CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE SIGHT TOUCHED HADDEN AND ONCE OR TWICE HE WAS SHAKEN BY SO SHARP A PANG OF REMORSE AT THE THOUGHT OF HIS SHARE IN THIS TRAGEDY
5825-53035-0014 THAT HE CAST ABOUT IN HIS MIND SEEKING A MEANS TO UNRAVEL THE WEB OF DEATH WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD WOVEN BUT EVER THAT EVIL VOICE WAS WHISPERING AT HIS EAR
5825-53035-0015 THE WHITE INKOOS HAD BEEN REFUSED BY THIS DUSKY BEAUTY AND THAT IF HE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE HIM WITHIN SOME FEW HOURS SHE WOULD BE THE WIFE OF THE SAVAGE GENTLEMAN AT HER SIDE
5825-53035-0016 THE MAN WHO HAD NAMED HIM BLACK HEART AND WHO DESPISED HIM THE MAN WHOM HE HAD MEANT TO MURDER AND WHO IMMEDIATELY REPAID HIS TREACHERY BY RESCUING HIM FROM THE JAWS OF THE LEOPARD
5825-53035-0017 MOREOVER IT WAS A LAW OF HADDEN'S EXISTENCE NEVER TO DENY HIMSELF OF ANYTHING THAT HE DESIRED IF IT LAY WITHIN HIS POWER TO TAKE IT A LAW WHICH HAD LED HIM ALWAYS DEEPER INTO SIN
5825-53035-0018 IN OTHER RESPECTS INDEED IT HAD NOT CARRIED HIM FAR FOR IN THE PAST HE HAD NOT DESIRED MUCH AND HE HAD WON LITTLE BUT THIS PARTICULAR FLOWER WAS TO HIS HAND AND HE WOULD PLUCK IT
5825-53035-0019 IF NAHOON STOOD BETWEEN HIM AND THE FLOWER SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR NAHOON AND IF IT SHOULD WITHER IN HIS GRASP SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THE FLOWER IT COULD ALWAYS BE THROWN AWAY
5825-53035-0020 THUS IT CAME ABOUT THAT NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE PHILIP HADDEN DISCARDED THE SOMEWHAT SPASMODIC PRICKINGS OF CONSCIENCE AND LISTENED TO THAT EVIL WHISPERING AT HIS EAR
5825-53035-0021 ABOUT HALF PAST FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE FOUR REFUGEES PASSED THE STREAM THAT A MILE OR SO DOWN FELL OVER THE LITTLE PRECIPICE INTO THE DOOM POOL
5825-53035-0022 AND ENTERING A PATCH OF THORN TREES ON THE FURTHER SIDE WALKED STRAIGHT INTO THE MIDST OF TWO AND TWENTY SOLDIERS WHO WERE BEGUILING THE TEDIUM OF EXPECTANCY BY THE TAKING OF SNUFF AND THE SMOKING OF DAKKA OR NATIVE HEMP
5825-53035-0023 REPLACED THE SNUFF BOXES IN THE SLITS MADE IN THE LOBES OF THEIR EARS AND SECURED THE FOUR OF THEM WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS O KING'S SOLDIERS ASKED UMGONA IN A QUAVERING VOICE
5825-53035-0024 WHY DO YOU MOLEST US INDEED WHEREFORE THEN ARE YOUR FACES SET TOWARDS THE SOUTH DOES THE BLACK ONE LIVE IN THE SOUTH WELL
5825-53035-0025 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND STAMMERED UMGONA THEN I WILL EXPLAIN WHILE YOU REST SAID THE CAPTAIN THE CHIEF MAPUTA YONDER SENT WORD TO THE BLACK ONE AT ULUNDI THAT HE HAD LEARNED OF YOUR INTENDED FLIGHT TO NATAL
5825-53035-0026 FROM THE LIPS OF THIS WHITE MAN WHO HAD WARNED HIM OF IT THE BLACK ONE WAS ANGRY AND DESPATCHED US TO CATCH YOU AND MAKE AN END OF YOU THAT IS ALL COME ON NOW QUIETLY AND LET US FINISH THE MATTER
5825-53035-0027 AS THE DOOM POOL IS NEAR YOUR DEATHS WILL BE EASY NAHOON HEARD THE WORDS AND SPRANG STRAIGHT AT THE THROAT OF HADDEN BUT HE DID NOT REACH IT FOR THE SOLDIERS PULLED HIM DOWN NANEA HEARD THEM ALSO
5825-53035-0028 SHE SAID NOTHING SHE ONLY LOOKED BUT HE COULD NEVER FORGET THAT LOOK THE WHITE MAN FOR HIS PART WAS FILLED WITH A FIERY INDIGNATION AGAINST MAPUTA YOU WICKED VILLAIN HE GASPED
5825-53035-0029 WHEREAT THE CHIEF SMILED IN A SICKLY FASHION AND TURNED AWAY THEN THEY WERE MARCHED ALONG THE BANKS OF THE STREAM TILL THEY REACHED THE WATERFALL THAT FELL INTO THE POOL OF DOOM HADDEN WAS A BRAVE MAN AFTER HIS FASHION
5825-53035-0030 BUT HIS HEART QUAILED AS HE GAZED INTO THAT ABYSS ARE YOU GOING TO THROW ME IN THERE HE ASKED OF THE ZULU CAPTAIN IN A THICK VOICE YOU WHITE MAN REPLIED THE SOLDIER UNCONCERNEDLY NO
5825-53035-0031 OUR ORDERS ARE TO TAKE YOU TO THE KING BUT WHAT HE WILL DO WITH YOU I DO NOT KNOW THERE IS TO BE WAR BETWEEN YOUR PEOPLE AND OURS SO PERHAPS HE MEANS TO POUND YOU INTO MEDICINE FOR THE USE OF THE WITCH DOCTORS
5825-53035-0032 OR TO PEG YOU OVER AN ANT HEAP AS A WARNING TO OTHER WHITE MEN HADDEN RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION IN SILENCE BUT ITS EFFECT UPON HIS BRAIN WAS BRACING FOR INSTANTLY HE BEGAN TO SEARCH OUT SOME MEANS OF ESCAPE
5825-53035-0033 BY NOW THE PARTY HAD HALTED NEAR THE TWO THORN TREES THAT HUNG OVER THE WATERS OF THE POOL WHO DIVES FIRST ASKED THE CAPTAIN OF THE CHIEF MAPUTA THE OLD WIZARD HE REPLIED
5825-53035-0034 NODDING AT UMGONA THEN HIS DAUGHTER AFTER HIM AND LAST OF ALL THIS FELLOW AND HE STRUCK NAHOON IN THE FACE WITH HIS OPEN HAND COME ON WIZARD SAID THE CAPTAIN GRASPING UMGONA BY THE ARM
5825-53035-0035 AND LET US SEE HOW YOU CAN SWIM AT THE WORDS OF DOOM UMGONA SEEMED TO RECOVER HIS SELF COMMAND AFTER THE FASHION OF HIS RACE NO NEED TO LEAD ME SOLDIER HE SAID
5825-53035-0036 SHAKING HIMSELF LOOSE WHO AM OLD AND READY TO DIE THEN HE KISSED HIS DAUGHTER AT HIS SIDE WRUNG NAHOON BY THE HAND AND TURNING FROM HADDEN WITH A GESTURE OF CONTEMPT
5825-53035-0037 WALKED OUT UPON THE PLATFORM THAT JOINED THE TWO THORN TRUNKS HERE HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT LOOKING AT THE SETTING SUN THEN SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT A SOUND HE HURLED HIMSELF INTO THE ABYSS BELOW AND VANISHED
5825-53035-0038 THAT WAS A BRAVE ONE SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH ADMIRATION CAN YOU SPRING TOO GIRL OR MUST WE THROW YOU I CAN WALK MY FATHER'S PATH
5825-53035-0039 NANEA ANSWERED FAINTLY BUT FIRST I CRAVE LEAVE TO SAY ONE WORD IT IS TRUE THAT WE WERE ESCAPING FROM THE KING AND THEREFORE BY THE LAW WE MUST DIE BUT IT WAS BLACK HEART HERE WHO MADE THE PLOT
5825-53035-0040 AND HE WHO HAS BETRAYED US WOULD YOU KNOW WHY HE HAS BETRAYED US BECAUSE HE SOUGHT MY FAVOUR AND I REFUSED HIM AND THIS IS THE VENGEANCE THAT HE TAKES A WHITE MAN'S VENGEANCE
5825-53035-0041 BROKE IN THE CHIEF MAPUTA THIS PRETTY ONE SPEAKS TRUTH FOR THE WHITE MAN WOULD HAVE MADE A BARGAIN WITH ME UNDER WHICH UMGONA THE WIZARD AND NAHOON THE SOLDIER WERE TO BE KILLED AT THE CROCODILE DRIFT
5825-53035-0042 AND HE HIMSELF SUFFERED TO ESCAPE WITH THE GIRL I SPOKE HIM SOFTLY AND SAID YES AND THEN LIKE A LOYAL MAN I REPORTED TO THE KING YOU HEAR SIGHED NANEA NAHOON
5825-53035-0043 FARE YOU WELL THOUGH PRESENTLY PERHAPS WE SHALL BE TOGETHER AGAIN IT WAS I WHO TEMPTED YOU FROM YOUR DUTY FOR MY SAKE YOU FORGOT YOUR HONOUR AND I AM REPAID FAREWELL MY HUSBAND
5825-53035-0044 SHE TURNED AND ADDRESSED HADDEN SAYING BLACK HEART YOU SEEM TO HAVE WON THE DAY
5825-53035-0045 AFTER SUNSET COMES THE NIGHT BLACK HEART AND IN THAT NIGHT I PRAY THAT YOU MAY WANDER ETERNALLY AND BE GIVEN TO DRINK OF MY BLOOD AND THE BLOOD OF UMGONA MY FATHER
5825-53035-0046 AND THE BLOOD OF NAHOON MY HUSBAND WHO SAVED YOUR LIFE AND WHOM YOU HAVE MURDERED PERCHANCE BLACK HEART
5825-53035-0047 THEN UTTERING A LOW CRY NANEA CLASPED HER HANDS AND SPRANG UPWARDS AND OUTWARDS FROM THE PLATFORM THE WATCHERS BENT THEIR HEADS FORWARD TO LOOK
5825-53035-0048 THEY SAW HER RUSH HEADLONG DOWN THE FACE OF THE FALL TO STRIKE THE WATER FIFTY FEET BELOW A FEW SECONDS AND FOR THE LAST TIME THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER WHITE GARMENT
5825-53035-0049 GLIMMERING ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLOOMY POOL THEN THE SHADOWS AND MIST WREATHS HID IT AND SHE WAS GONE NOW HUSBAND CRIED THE CHEERFUL VOICE OF THE CAPTAIN
5825-53035-0050 SO BE SWIFT TO FOLLOW A BRIDE WHO IS SO READY TO LEAD THE WAY
5825-53035-0051 BUT YOU ARE GOOD PEOPLE TO KILL NEVER HAVE I HAD TO DO WITH ANY WHO GAVE LESS TROUBLE YOU AND HE STOPPED FOR MENTAL AGONY HAD DONE ITS WORK
5825-53035-0052 AND SUDDENLY NAHOON WENT MAD BEFORE HIS EYES WITH A ROAR LIKE THAT OF A LION THE GREAT MAN CAST OFF THOSE WHO HELD HIM AND SEIZING ONE OF THEM ROUND THE WAIST AND THIGH HE PUT OUT ALL HIS TERRIBLE STRENGTH
5825-53035-0053 LIFTING HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN AN INFANT HE HURLED HIM OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF TO FIND HIS DEATH ON THE ROCKS OF THE POOL OF DOOM THEN CRYING BLACK HEART YOUR TURN BLACK HEART THE TRAITOR HE RUSHED AT HADDEN
5825-53035-0054 BUT HE COULD NOT COME AT HIM FOR THE SOLDIERS SPRANG UPON HIM AND NOTWITHSTANDING HIS FEARFUL STRUGGLES THEY PULLED HIM TO THE GROUND AS AT CERTAIN FESTIVALS THE ZULU REGIMENTS WITH THEIR NAKED HANDS
5825-53035-0055 PULL DOWN A BULL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING CAST HIM OVER BEFORE HE CAN WORK MORE MISCHIEF SAID A VOICE BUT THE CAPTAIN CRIED OUT NAY NAY HE IS SACRED THE FIRE FROM HEAVEN HAS FALLEN ON HIS BRAIN
5825-53035-0056 AND WE MAY NOT HARM HIM ELSE EVIL WOULD OVERTAKE US ALL BIND HIM HAND AND FOOT AND BEAR HIM TENDERLY TO WHERE HE CAN BE CARED FOR SURELY I THOUGHT THAT THESE EVIL DOERS WERE GIVING US TOO LITTLE TROUBLE
5825-53035-0057 AND THUS IT HAS PROVED SO THEY SET THEMSELVES TO MAKE FAST NAHOON'S HANDS AND WRISTS USING AS MUCH GENTLENESS AS THEY MIGHT FOR AMONG THE ZULUS A LUNATIC IS ACCOUNTED HOLY
5825-53035-0058 IT WAS NO EASY TASK AND IT TOOK TIME HADDEN GLANCED AROUND HIM AND SAW HIS OPPORTUNITY ON THE GROUND CLOSE BESIDE HIM LAY HIS RIFLE WHERE ONE OF THE SOLDIERS HAD PLACED IT
5825-53035-0059 AND ABOUT A DOZEN YARDS AWAY MAPUTA'S PONY WAS GRAZING WITH A SWIFT MOVEMENT HE SEIZED THE MARTINI AND FIVE SECONDS LATER HE WAS ON THE BACK OF THE PONY HEADING FOR THE CROCODILE DRIFT AT A GALLOP
5825-53035-0060 THAT OCCUPIED AS THEY ALL WERE IN BINDING NAHOON FOR HALF A MINUTE OR MORE NONE OF THE SOLDIERS NOTICED WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEN MAPUTA CHANCED TO SEE AND WADDLED AFTER HIM TO THE TOP OF THE RISE SCREAMING
5825-53035-0061 HE HAS STOLEN MY HORSE AND THE GUN TOO THE GUN THAT HE PROMISED TO GIVE ME HADDEN WHO BY THIS TIME WAS A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY HEARD HIM CLEARLY AND A RAGE FILLED HIS HEART
5825-53035-0062 THIS MAN HAD MADE AN OPEN MURDERER OF HIM MORE HE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF ROBBING HIM OF THE GIRL FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD DIPPED HIS HANDS IN THESE INIQUITIES HE GLANCED OVER HIS SHOULDER MAPUTA WAS STILL RUNNING AND ALONE
5825-53035-0063 YES THERE WAS TIME AT ANY RATE HE WOULD RISK IT PULLING UP THE PONY WITH A JERK HE LEAPT FROM ITS BACK SLIPPING HIS ARM THROUGH THE REIN WITH AN ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT AS IT CHANCED
5825-53035-0064 AND AS HE HAD HOPED WOULD BE THE CASE THE ANIMAL WAS A TRAINED SHOOTING HORSE AND STOOD STILL
