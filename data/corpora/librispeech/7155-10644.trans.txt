7155-10644-0000 HOW IS ONE TO RECONCILE THE WANT OF MANLINESS MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL WHICH HADOW ASSERTS
7155-10644-0001 HERE ARE THE CANNON BURIED IN FLOWERS OF ROBERT SCHUMANN HERE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCES OF VERSATILITY VIRILITY AND PASSION CHOPIN BLINDED HIS CRITICS AND ADMIRERS ALIKE A DELICATE PUNY FELLOW
7155-10644-0002 HE COULD PLAY THE PIANO ON OCCASION LIKE A DEVIL INCARNATE HE TOO HAD HIS DEMON AS WELL AS LISZT AND ONLY AS EHLERT PUTS IT THEORETICAL FEAR OF THIS SPIRIT DRIVING HIM OVER THE CLIFFS OF REASON MADE HIM CURB ITS ANTICS
7155-10644-0003 IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE CHOPIN AS BEING IRASCIBLE AND ALMOST BRUTAL YET HE WAS AT TIMES EVEN THIS
7155-10644-0004 WRESTLING WITH HIS WRATH AS ONE UNDER THE OBSESSION OF A FIEND IT IS NO DESIRE TO EXAGGERATE THIS SIDE OF HIS NATURE THAT IMPELS THIS PLAIN WRITING CHOPIN LEFT COMPOSITIONS THAT BEAR WITNESS TO HIS MASCULINE SIDE DIMINUTIVE IN PERSON
7155-10644-0005 BAD TEMPER BECAME HIM ILL BESIDES HIS WHOLE EDUCATION AND TASTES WERE OPPOSED TO SCENES OF VIOLENCE SO THIS ENERGY SPLEEN AND RAGING AT FORTUNE FOUND ESCAPE IN SOME OF HIS MUSIC
7155-10644-0006 BECAME PSYCHICAL IN ITS MANIFESTATIONS BUT YOU MAY SAY THIS IS FEMININE HYSTERIA THE IMPOTENT CRIES OF AN UNMANLY WEAK NATURE READ THE E FLAT MINOR THE C MINOR THE A MAJOR THE F SHARP MINOR
7155-10644-0007 AND THE TWO A FLAT MAJOR POLONAISES BALLADES SCHERZI STUDIES PRELUDES AND THE GREAT F MINOR FANTAISIE ARE PURPOSELY OMITTED FROM THIS AWING SCHEME CHOPIN WAS WEAK IN PHYSIQUE
7155-10644-0008 THERE IS NO DOUBT HE IDEALIZED HIS COUNTRY AND HER WRONGS
7155-10644-0009 POLITICALLY THE POLES AND CELTS RUB SHOULDERS NIECKS POINTS OUT THAT IF CHOPIN WAS A FLATTERING IDEALIST AS A NATIONAL POET AS A PERSONAL POET HE WAS AN UNCOMPROMISING REALIST SO IN THE POLONAISES WE FIND TWO DISTINCT GROUPS
7155-10644-0010 IN ONE THE OBJECTIVE MARTIAL SIDE PREDOMINATES IN THE OTHER IS CHOPIN THE MOODY MOURNFUL AND MOROSE BUT IN ALL THE POLISH ELEMENT PERVADES BARRING THE MAZURKAS THESE DANCES ARE THE MOST POLISH OF HIS WORKS
7155-10644-0011 WOULD HAVE SPAREDTHE WORLD THE FALSE SILLY DISTORTED PORTRAITS OF HIM HE HAD THE WARRIOR IN HIM EVEN IF HIS MAILED FIST WAS SELDOM USED THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN HE DISCARDS GLOVES AND SOFT PHRASES AND DEALS BLOWS
7155-10644-0012 THAT REVERBERATE WITH FORMIDABLE CLANGOR BY ALL MEANS READ LISZT'S GORGEOUS DESCRIPTION OF THE POLONAISE ORIGINATING DURING THE LAST HALF OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS AT FIRST A MEASURED PROCESSION OF NOBLES AND THEIR WOMANKIND TO THE SOUND OF MUSIC
7155-10644-0013 IN THE COURT OF HENRY OF ANJOU IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AFTER HIS ELECTION TO THE POLISH THRONE THE POLONAISE WAS BORN AND THROVE IN THE HARDY WARLIKE ATMOSPHERE IT BECAME A DANCE POLITICAL AND HAD WORDS SET TO IT
7155-10644-0014 THUS CAME THE KOSCIUSZKO THE OGINSKI THE MONIUSZKO
7155-10644-0015 IT IS REALLY A MARCH A PROCESSIONAL DANCE GRAVE MODERATE FLOWING AND BY NO MEANS STEREOTYPED LISZT TELLS OF THE CAPRICIOUS LIFE INFUSED INTO ITS COURTLY MEASURES BY THE POLISH ARISTOCRACY
7155-10644-0016 IT IS AT ONCE THE SYMBOL OF WAR AND LOVE A VIVID PAGEANT OF MARTIAL SPLENDOR A WEAVING CADENCED VOLUPTUOUS DANCE THE PURSUIT OF SHY COQUETTISH WOMAN BY THE FIERCE WARRIOR THE POLONAISE
7155-10644-0017 IS IN THREE FOUR TIME WITH THE ACCENT ON THE SECOND BEAT OF THE BAR IN SIMPLE BINARY FORM TERNARY IF A TRIO IS ADDED THIS DANCE HAS FEMININE ENDINGS TO ALL THE PRINCIPAL CADENCES THE RHYTHMICAL CAST OF THE BASS IS SELDOM CHANGED
7155-10644-0018 DESPITE ITS ESSENTIALLY MASCULINE MOULD IT IS GIVEN A FEMININE TITLE FORMERLY
7155-10644-0019 LISZT WROTE OF IT IN THIS FORM THE NOBLEST TRADITIONAL FEELINGS OF ANCIENT POLAND ARE REPRESENTED THE POLONAISE IS THE TRUE AND PUREST TYPE OF POLISH NATIONAL CHARACTER AS IN THE COURSE OF CENTURIES IT WAS DEVELOPED PARTLY THROUGH THE POLITICAL POSITION OF THE KINGDOM TOWARD EAST AND WEST
7155-10644-0020 PARTLY THROUGH AN UNDEFINABLE PECULIAR INBORN DISPOSITION OF THE ENTIRE RACE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLONAISE EVERYTHING CO OPERATED WHICH SPECIFICALLY DISTINGUISHED THE NATION FROM OTHERS IN THE POLES OF DEPARTED TIMES MANLY RESOLUTION WAS UNITED
7155-10644-0021 WITH GLOWING DEVOTION TO THE OBJECT OF THEIR LOVE THEIR KNIGHTLY HEROISM WAS SANCTIONED BY HIGH SOARING DIGNITY AND EVEN THE LAWS OF GALLANTRY AND THE NATIONAL COSTUME EXERTED AN INFLUENCE OVER THE TURNS OF THIS DANCE
7155-10644-0022 THE POLONAISES ARE THE KEYSTONE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FORM THEY BELONG TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF CHOPIN INSPIRATIONS WITH THEIR ENERGETIC RHYTHM THEY ELECTRIFY TO THE POINT OF EXCITED DEMONSTRATION EVEN THE SLEEPIEST INDIFFERENTISM
7155-10644-0023 CHOPIN WAS BORN TOO LATE AND LEFT HIS NATIVE HEARTH TOO EARLY TO BE INITIATED INTO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE POLONAISE AS DANCED THROUGH HIS OWN OBSERVATION BUT WHAT OTHERS IMPARTED TO HIM IN REGARD TO IT WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY HIS FANCY AND HIS NATIONALITY
7155-10644-0024 CHOPIN WROTE FIFTEEN POLONAISES THE AUTHENTICITY OF ONE IN G FLAT MAJOR BEING DOUBTED BY NIECKS
7155-10644-0025 THIS LATTER POLONAISE IS PRECEDED BY AN ANDANTE SPIANATO IN G IN SIX EIGHT TIME AND UNACCOMPANIED IT IS A CHARMING LIQUID TONED NOCTURNE LIKE COMPOSITION CHOPIN IN HIS MOST SUAVE
7155-10644-0026 HIS MOST PLACID MOOD A BARCAROLLE SCARCELY A RIPPLE OF EMOTION DISTURBS THE MIRRORED CALM OF THIS LAKE AFTER SIXTEEN BARS OF A CRUDELY HARMONIZED TUTTI COMES THE POLONAISE
7155-10644-0027 IN THE WIDELY REMOTE KEY OF E FLAT IT IS BRILLIANT EVERY NOTE TELLING THE FIGURATION RICH AND NOVEL THE MOVEMENT SPIRITED AND FLOWING PERHAPS IT IS TOO LONG AND LACKS RELIEF THE THEME ON EACH RE ENTRANCE IS
7155-10644-0028 VARIED ORNAMENTALLY THE SECOND THEME IN C MINOR HAS A POLISH AND POETIC RING WHILE THE CODA IS EFFECTIVE THIS OPUS IS VIVACIOUS BUT NOT CHARACTERIZED BY GREAT DEPTH CRYSTALLINE GRACIOUS AND REFINED
7155-10644-0029 THE PIECE IS STAMPED PARIS THE ELEGANT PARIS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY COMPOSED IN THAT YEAR AND PUBLISHED IN JULY EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX
7155-10644-0030 CHOPIN INTRODUCED IT AT A CONSERVATOIRE CONCERT FOR THE BENEFIT OF HABENECK APRIL TWENTY SIXTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE THIS ACCORDING TO NIECKS WAS THE ONLY TIME HE PLAYED THE POLONAISE WITH ORCHESTRAL ACCOMPANIMENT
7155-10644-0031 IT WAS PRACTICALLY A NOVELTY TO NEW YORK WHEN RAFAEL JOSEFFY PLAYED IT HERE SUPERLATIVELY WELL IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE ORCHESTRAL PART SEEMS WHOLLY SUPERFLUOUS FOR THE SCORING IS NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE
7155-10644-0032 AND THERE IS A RUMOR THAT CHOPIN CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR IT XAVER SCHARWENKA MADE A NEW INSTRUMENTATION THAT IS DISCREET AND EXTREMELY WELL SOUNDING WITH EXCELLENT TACT
7155-10644-0033 GIVING SOME THEMATIC WORK OF THE SLIGHTEST TEXTURE TO THE STRINGS AND IN THE PRETTY CODA TO THE WOOD WIND A DELICATELY MANAGED ALLUSION IS MADE BY THE HORNS TO THE SECOND THEME OF THE NOCTURNE IN G
7155-10644-0034 THERE ARE EVEN FIVE FAINT TAPS OF THE TRIANGLE AND THE IDYLLIC ATMOSPHERE IS NEVER DISTURBED SCHARWENKA FIRST PLAYED THIS ARRANGEMENT
7155-10644-0035 IN CHICKERING HALL NEW YORK APRIL EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT YET I CANNOT TRUTHFULLY SAY THE POLONAISE SOUNDS SO CHARACTERISTIC AS WHEN PLAYED SOLO
7155-10644-0036 HAS HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING SENTIMENTALIZED TO DEATH WHAT CAN BE MORE APPASSIONATA THAN THE OPENING WITH ITS GRAND RHYTHMICAL SWING
7155-10644-0037 THE FIRST THREE LINES ARE HUGELY HEROIC BUT THE INDIGNATION SOON MELTS AWAY LEAVING AN APATHETIC HUMOR AFTER THE THEME RETURNS AND IS REPEATED WE GET A GENUINE LOVE MOTIF TENDER ENOUGH IN ALL FAITH WHEREWITH TO WOO A PRINCESS
7155-10644-0038 ON THIS THE POLONAISE CLOSES AN ODD ENDING FOR SUCH A FIERY OPENING
7155-10644-0039 IN E FLAT MINOR IT IS VARIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE SIBERIAN THE REVOLT POLONAISE IT BREATHES DEFIANCE AND RANCOR FROM THE START WHAT SUPPRESSED AND THREATENING RUMBLINGS ARE THERE VOLCANIC MUTTERINGS THESE
7155-10644-0040 MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT IT IS A SINISTER PAGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE INJUNCTION TO OPEN WITH PIANISSIMO ONE WISHES THAT THE SHRILL HIGH G FLAT
7155-10644-0041 HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN FULL CHORDS AS THE THEME SUFFERS FROM A WANT OF MASSIVENESS THEN FOLLOWS A SUBSIDIARY BUT THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT RETURNS RELENTLESSLY THE EPISODE IN B MAJOR GIVES PAUSE FOR BREATHING
7155-10644-0042 IT HAS A HINT OF MEYERBEER BUT AGAIN WITH SMOTHERED EXPLOSIONS THE POLONAISE PROPER APPEARS AND ALL ENDS IN GLOOM AND THE IMPOTENT CLANKING OF CHAINS IT IS AN AWE PROVOKING WORK
7155-10644-0043 IT WAS PUBLISHED JULY EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX AND IS DEDICATED TO M J DESSAUER
7155-10644-0044 LE MILITAIRE TO RUBINSTEIN THIS SEEMED A PICTURE OF POLAND'S GREATNESS AS ITS COMPANION IN C MINOR IS OF POLAND'S DOWNFALL ALTHOUGH KARASOWSKI AND KLECZYNSKI
7155-10644-0045 GIVE TO THE A FLAT MAJOR POLONAISE THE HONOR OF SUGGESTING A WELL KNOWN STORY IT IS REALLY THE A MAJOR THAT PROVOKED IT SO THE POLISH PORTRAIT PAINTER KWIATOWSKI INFORMED NIECKS THE STORY RUNS THAT AFTER COMPOSING IT
7155-10644-0046 CHOPIN IN THE DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WAS SURPRISED TERRIFIED IS A BETTER WORD BY THE OPENING OF HIS DOOR AND THE ENTRANCE OF A LONG TRAIN OF POLISH NOBLES AND LADIES RICHLY ROBED WHO MOVED SLOWLY BY HIM
7155-10644-0047 TROUBLED BY THE GHOSTS OF THE PAST HE HAD RAISED THE COMPOSER HOLLOW EYED FLED THE APARTMENT
7155-10644-0048 CAN ANYTHING BE MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THIS OPENING MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT IT IS INDEED POLAND'S DOWNFALL THE TRIO IN A FLAT WITH ITS KALEIDOSCOPIC MODULATIONS PRODUCES AN IMPRESSION OF VAGUE UNREST AND SUPPRESSED SORROW
7155-10644-0049 THERE IS LOFTINESS OF SPIRIT AND DARING IN IT WHAT CAN ONE SAY NEW OF THE TREMENDOUS F SHARP MINOR POLONAISE WILLEBY CALLS IT NOISY
7155-10644-0050 WHOM VANCE THOMPSON CHRISTENED A PRESTIDIGIOUS NOCTAMBULIST HAS LITERALLY STORMED OVER IT IT IS BARBARIC IT IS PERHAPS PATHOLOGIC AND OF IT LISZT HAS SAID MOST ELOQUENT THINGS IT IS FOR HIM A DREAM POEM
7155-10644-0051 THE LURID HOUR THAT PRECEDES A HURRICANE
7155-10644-0052 THE OPENING IS VERY IMPRESSIVE THE NERVE PULP BEING HARASSED BY THE GRADUALLY SWELLING PRELUDE THERE IS DEFIANT POWER IN THE FIRST THEME AND THE CONSTANT REFERENCE TO IT BETRAYS THE COMPOSER'S EXASPERATED MENTAL CONDITION
7155-10644-0053 THIS TENDENCY TO RETURN UPON HIMSELF A TORMENTING INTROSPECTION CERTAINLY SIGNIFIES A GRAVE STATE BUT CONSIDER THE MUSICAL WEIGHT OF THE WORK THE RECKLESSLY BOLD OUTPOURINGS OF A MIND ALMOST DISTRAUGHT
7155-10644-0054 THERE IS NO GREATER TEST FOR THE POET PIANIST THAN THE F SHARP MINOR POLONAISE IT IS PROFOUNDLY IRONICAL WHAT ELSE MEANS THE INTRODUCTION OF THAT LOVELY MAZURKA A FLOWER BETWEEN TWO ABYSSES
7155-10644-0055 THIS STRANGE DANCE IS USHERED IN BY TWO OF THE MOST ENIGMATIC PAGES OF CHOPIN
7155-10644-0056 IS NOT EASILY DEFENSIBLE ON THE SCORE OF FORM YET IT UNMISTAKABLY FITS IN THE PICTURE THE MAZURKA IS FULL OF INTERROGATION AND EMOTIONAL NUANCIREN THE RETURN OF THE TEMPEST IS NOT LONG DELAYED
7155-10644-0057 IT BURSTS WANES AND WITH THE CODA COMES SAD YEARNING THEN THE SAVAGE DRAMA PASSES TREMBLINGLY INTO THE NIGHT AFTER FLUID AND WAVERING AFFIRMATIONS A ROAR IN F SHARP
7155-10644-0058 AND FINALLY A SILENCE THAT MARKS THE CESSATION OF AN AGITATING NIGHTMARE NO SABRE DANCE THIS BUT A CONFESSION FROM THE DARK DEPTHS OF A SELF TORTURED SOUL
7155-10644-0059 DE BEAUVAU THERE ARE FEW EDITORIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE EIGHTEENTH BAR FROM THE BEGINNING
7155-10644-0060 FILLS OUT AN OCTAVE NOT SO IN KLINDWORTH NOR IN THE ORIGINAL AT THE TWENTIETH BAR KLINDWORTH DIFFERS FROM THE ORIGINAL AS FOLLOWS THE CHOPIN TEXT IS THE UPPER ONE MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPTS
7155-10644-0061 AND IS SAID BY KARASOWSKI TO HAVE BEEN COMPOSED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY
7155-10644-0062 IT IS DEDICATED TO A LEO THIS IS THE ONE KARASOWSKI CALLS THE STORY OF CHOPIN'S VISION OF THE ANTIQUE DEAD IN AN ISOLATED TOWER OF MADAME SAND'S CHATEAU AT NOHANT
7155-10644-0063 WE HAVE SEEN THIS LEGEND DISPROVED BY ONE WHO KNOWS THIS POLONAISE IS NOT AS FEVERISH AND AS EXALTED AS THE PREVIOUS ONE IT IS AS KLECZYNSKI WRITES THE TYPE OF A WAR SONG
7155-10644-0064 AND SILVER SPUR THERE IS IMAGINATIVE SPLENDOR IN THIS THRILLING WORK WITH ITS THUNDER OF HORSES HOOFS AND FIERCE CHALLENGINGS WHAT FIRE WHAT SWORD THRUSTS AND SMOKE AND CLASH OF MORTAL CONFLICT
7155-10644-0065 HERE IS NO PSYCHICAL PRESENTATION BUT AN OBJECTIVE PICTURE OF BATTLE OF CONCRETE CONTOURS AND WITH A CLEAVING BRILLIANCY THAT EXCITES THE BLOOD TO BOILING PITCH THAT CHOPIN EVER PLAYED IT AS INTENDED IS INCREDIBLE
7155-10644-0066 NONE BUT THE HEROES OF THE KEYBOARD MAY GRASP ITS DENSE CHORDAL MASSES ITS FIERY PROJECTILES OF TONE BUT THERE IS SOMETHING DISTURBING EVEN GHOSTLY IN THE STRANGE INTERMEZZO THAT SEPARATES THE TRIO FROM THE POLONAISE BOTH MIST AND STARLIGHT ARE IN IT
7155-10644-0067 YET THE WORK IS PLAYED TOO FAST AND HAS BEEN NICKNAMED THE DRUM POLONAISE LOSING IN MAJESTY AND FORCE BECAUSE OF THE VANITY OF VIRTUOSI THE OCTAVES IN E MAJOR ARE SPUN OUT AS IF SPEED WERE THE SOLE IDEA OF THIS EPISODE
7155-10644-0068 FOLLOW KLECZYNSKI'S ADVICE AND DO NOT SACRIFICE THE POLONAISE TO THE OCTAVES KARL TAUSIG SO JOSEFFY AND DE LENZ ASSERT PLAYED THIS POLONAISE IN AN UNAPPROACHABLE MANNER POWERFUL BATTLE TABLEAU AS IT IS
7155-10644-0069 IT MAY STILL BE PRESENTED SO AS NOT TO SHOCK ONE'S SENSE OF THE EUPHONIOUS OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THE INSTRUMENT THIS WORK BECOMES VAPID AND UNHEROIC WHEN TRANSFERRED TO THE ORCHESTRA
7155-10644-0070 GIVEN TO THE WORLD SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX IS DEDICATED TO MADAME A VEYRET ONE OF THREE GREAT POLONAISES IT IS JUST BEGINNING TO BE UNDERSTOOD HAVING BEEN DERIDED AS AMORPHOUS FEBRILE
7155-10644-0071 OF LITTLE MUSICAL MOMENT EVEN LISZT DECLARING THAT SUCH PICTURES POSSESS BUT LITTLE REAL VALUE TO ART DEPLORABLE VISIONS WHICH THE ARTIST SHOULD ADMIT WITH EXTREME CIRCUMSPECTION WITHIN THE GRACEFUL CIRCLE OF HIS CHARMED REALM
7155-10644-0072 THIS WAS WRITTEN IN THE OLD FASHIONED DAYS WHEN ART WAS ARISTOCRATIC AND EXCLUDED THE BASER AND MORE PAINFUL EMOTIONS FOR A GENERATION ACCUSTOMED TO THE REALISM OF RICHARD STRAUSS THE FANTAISIE POLONAISE SEEMS VAPOROUS AND IDEALISTIC WITHAL NEW
7155-10644-0073 THIS POLONAISE AT NO TIME EXHIBITS THE SOLIDITY OF ITS TWO PREDECESSORS ITS PLASTICITY DEFIES THE IMPRINT OF THE CONVENTIONAL POLONAISE THOUGH WE EVER FEEL ITS RHYTHMS IT MAY BE FULL OF MONOLOGUES INTERSPERSED CADENZAS
7155-10644-0074 IMPROVISED PRELUDES AND SHORT PHRASES AS KULLAK SUGGESTS YET THERE IS UNITY IN THE COMPOSITION THE UNITS OF STRUCTURE AND STYLE IT WAS MUSIC OF THE FUTURE WHEN CHOPIN COMPOSED IT IS NOW MUSIC OF THE PRESENT AS MUCH AS RICHARD WAGNER'S
7155-10644-0075 HERE IS THE DUALITY OF CHOPIN THE SUFFERING MAN AND CHOPIN THE PROPHET OF POLAND UNDIMMED IS HIS POETIC VISION POLAND WILL BE FREE UNDAUNTED HIS SOUL THOUGH OPPRESSED BY A SUFFERING BODY
7155-10644-0076 THERE ARE IN THE WORK THROES OF AGONY BLENDED WITH THE TRUMPET NOTES OF TRIUMPH AND WHAT PUZZLED OUR FATHERS THE SHIFTING LIGHTS AND SHADOWS THE RESTLESS TONALITIES ARE WELCOME FOR AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS NEW CENTURY THE CHROMATIC IS KING
7155-10644-0077 THE ENDING OF THIS POLONAISE IS TRIUMPHANT RECALLING IN KEY AND CLIMAXING THE A FLAT BALLADE CHOPIN IS STILL THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL AND POLAND WILL BE FREE
7155-10644-0078 ARE CELT AND SLAV DOOMED TO FOLLOW EVER THE PHOSPHORESCENT LIGHTS OF PATRIOTISM LISZT ACKNOWLEDGES THE BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR OF THIS LAST POLONAISE WHICH UNITES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SUPERB AND ORIGINAL MANIPULATION
7155-10644-0079 THE MARTIAL AND THE MELANCHOLIC OPUS SEVENTY ONE THREE POSTHUMOUS POLONAISES GIVEN TO THE WORLD BY JULIUS FONTANA ARE IN D MINOR PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
7155-10644-0080 AND F MINOR EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE THEY ARE INTERESTING TO CHOPINISTS THE INFLUENCE OF WEBER
7155-10644-0081 IS FELT OF THE THREE THE LAST IN F MINOR IS THE STRONGEST ALTHOUGH IF CHOPIN'S AGE IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THE FIRST IN D MINOR IS A FEAT FOR A LAD OF EIGHTEEN I AGREE WITH NIECKS THAT THE POSTHUMOUS POLONAISE WITHOUT OPUS NUMBER
7155-10644-0082 IN G SHARP MINOR WAS COMPOSED LATER THAN EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO THE DATE GIVEN IN THE BREITKOPF AND HARTEL EDITION IT IS AN ARTISTIC CONCEPTION AND IN LIGHT WINGED FIGURATION FAR MORE MATURE
7155-10644-0083 THAN THE CHOPIN OF OP SEVENTY ONE REALLY A GRACEFUL AND EFFECTIVE LITTLE COMPOSITION OF THE FLORID ORDER BUT LIKE HIS EARLY MUSIC WITHOUT POETIC DEPTH THE WARSAW ECHO MUSICALE
7155-10644-0084 PUBLISHED A SPECIAL NUMBER IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE WITH THE PICTURE OF A FARMER NAMED KRYSIAK BORN IN EIGHTEEN TEN THE YEAR AFTER THE COMPOSER THEREAT FINCK REMARKED
7155-10644-0085 A FAC SIMILE REPRODUCTION OF A HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED POLONAISE IN A FLAT WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS UNIQUE NUMBER THIS TINY DANCE SHOWS IT IS SAID THE CHARACTERISTIC PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE COMPOSER IN REALITY
7155-10644-0086 THIS POLACCA IS THIN A TENTATIVE GROPING AFTER A FORM THAT LATER WAS MASTERED SO MAGNIFICENTLY BY THE COMPOSER
7155-10644-0087 THE AUTOGRAPH IS CHOPIN'S MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT
7155-10644-0088 IT IS PRECEDED BY AN INTRODUCTION AND IS DEDICATED TO JOSEPH MERK THE CELLIST CHOPIN HIMSELF PRONOUNCED IT A BRILLIANT SALON PIECE IT IS NOW NOT EVEN THAT FOR IT SOUNDS ANTIQUATED AND THREADBARE
7155-10644-0089 THE PASSAGE WORK AT TIMES SMACKS OF CHOPIN AND WEBER A HINT OF THE MOUVEMENT PERPETUEL AND THE CELLO HAS THE BETTER OF THE BARGAIN EVIDENTLY WRITTEN FOR MY LADY'S CHAMBER TWO POLONAISES REMAIN
7155-10644-0090 ONE IN B FLAT MINOR WAS COMPOSED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX ON THE OCCASION OF THE COMPOSER'S DEPARTURE FOR REINERZ A FOOTNOTE TO THE EDITION OF THIS RATHER ELEGIAC PIECE TELLS THIS ADIEU
7155-10644-0091 IS THE TITLE AND THE TRIO IN D FLAT IS ACCREDITED TO AN AIR OF GAZZA LADRA WITH A SENTIMENTAL AU REVOIR INSCRIBED KLECZYNSKI HAS REVISED THE GEBETHNER AND WOLFF EDITION
7155-10644-0092 THE LITTLE CADENZA IN CHROMATIC DOUBLE NOTES ON THE LAST PAGE IS OF A CERTAINTY CHOPIN BUT THE POLONAISE IN G FLAT MAJOR PUBLISHED BY SCHOTT IS DOUBTFUL IT HAS A SHALLOW RING A BRILLIANT SUPERFICIALITY
7155-10644-0093 THERE ARE TRACES OF THE MASTER THROUGHOUT PARTICULARLY IN THE E FLAT MINOR TRIO BUT THERE ARE SOME VILE PROGRESSIONS AND AN AIR OF VULGARITY SURELY NOT CHOPIN'S THIS DANCE FORM SINCE THE DEATH OF THE GREAT COMPOSER HAS BEEN CHIEFLY DEVELOPED ON THE VIRTUOSO SIDE
7155-10644-0094 BEETHOVEN SCHUBERT WEBER AND EVEN BACH IN HIS B MINOR SUITE FOR STRINGS AND FLUTE ALSO INDULGED IN THIS FORM WAGNER AS A STUDENT WROTE A POLONAISE FOR FOUR HANDS IN D AND IN SCHUMANN'S PAPILLONS
7155-10644-0095 THERE IS A CHARMING SPECIMEN RUBINSTEIN COMPOSED A MOST BRILLIANT AND DRAMATIC EXAMPLE IN E FLAT IN LE BAL THE LISZT POLONAISES ALL SAID AND DONE ARE THE MOST REMARKABLE IN DESIGN AND EXECUTION SINCE CHOPIN
