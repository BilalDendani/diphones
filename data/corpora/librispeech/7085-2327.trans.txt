7085-2327-0000 SHE HAD EMBARKED ON A SOCIAL ADVENTURE OF NO LITTLE MAGNITUDE AS COMPARED WITH THE ACCUSTOMED SECLUSION AND STAGNATION OF HER PAST LIFE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT
7085-2327-0001 THEIR NEIGHBOURS HAD BEEN ELDERLY AND FEW NOT MUCH GIVEN TO SOCIAL INTERCOURSE BUT HELPFUL OR POLITELY SYMPATHETIC IN TIMES OF ILLNESS NEWSPAPERS OF THE ORDINARY KIND WERE A RARITY
7085-2327-0002 WERE DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY EITHER TO RELIGION OR TO POULTRY AND THE WORLD OF POLITICS WAS TO HER AN UNHEEDED UNEXPLORED REGION HER IDEAS ON LIFE IN GENERAL HAD BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF POPULAR RESPECTABLE NOVEL WRITERS
7085-2327-0003 AND MODIFIED OR EMPHASISED BY SUCH KNOWLEDGE AS HER AUNT THE VICAR AND HER AUNT'S HOUSEKEEPER HAD PUT AT HER DISPOSAL AND NOW IN HER TWENTY NINTH YEAR HER AUNT'S DEATH HAD LEFT HER WELL PROVIDED FOR AS REGARDS INCOME
7085-2327-0004 BUT SOMEWHAT ISOLATED IN THE MATTER OF KITH AND KIN AND HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP SHE HAD SOME COUSINS WHO WERE ON TERMS OF FRIENDLY THOUGH INFREQUENT CORRESPONDENCE WITH HER BUT AS THEY LIVED PERMANENTLY IN CEYLON
7085-2327-0005 A LOCALITY ABOUT WHICH SHE KNEW LITTLE BEYOND THE ASSURANCE CONTAINED IN THE MISSIONARY HYMN THAT THE HUMAN ELEMENT THERE WAS VILE THEY WERE NOT OF MUCH IMMEDIATE USE TO HER OTHER COUSINS SHE ALSO POSSESSED
7085-2327-0006 MORE DISTANT AS REGARDS RELATIONSHIP BUT NOT QUITE SO GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE SEEING THAT THEY LIVED SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDLANDS SHE COULD HARDLY REMEMBER EVER HAVING MET THEM BUT ONCE OR TWICE IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS
7085-2327-0007 THEY HAD EXPRESSED A POLITE WISH THAT SHE SHOULD PAY THEM A VISIT THEY HAD PROBABLY NOT BEEN UNDULY DEPRESSED BY THE FACT THAT HER AUNT'S FAILING HEALTH HAD PREVENTED HER FROM ACCEPTING THEIR INVITATION THE NOTE OF CONDOLENCE
7085-2327-0008 SHE HAD WRITTEN TO PROPOSE HERSELF AS A GUEST FOR A DEFINITE DATE SOME WEEK AHEAD THE FAMILY SHE REFLECTED WITH RELIEF WAS NOT A LARGE ONE THE TWO DAUGHTERS WERE MARRIED AND AWAY
7085-2327-0009 AND HER SON ROBERT AT HOME MISSUS BLUDWARD WAS SOMETHING OF AN INVALID AND ROBERT WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN AT OXFORD AND WAS GOING INTO PARLIAMENT FURTHER THAN THAT ALETHIA'S INFORMATION DID NOT GO
7085-2327-0010 HER IMAGINATION FOUNDED ON HER EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PEOPLE ONE MET IN NOVELS HAD TO SUPPLY THE GAPS THE MOTHER WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO PLACE SHE WOULD EITHER BE AN ULTRA AMIABLE OLD LADY
7085-2327-0011 BEARING HER FEEBLE HEALTH WITH UNCOMPLAINING FORTITUDE AND HAVING A KIND WORD FOR THE GARDENER'S BOY AND A SUNNY SMILE FOR THE CHANCE VISITOR OR ELSE SHE WOULD BE COLD AND PEEVISH WITH EYES THAT PIERCED YOU LIKE A GIMLET
7085-2327-0012 THERE WAS SIR JASPER WHO WAS UTTERLY VILE AND ABSOLUTELY UNSCRUPULOUS AND THERE WAS NEVIL WHO WAS NOT REALLY BAD AT HEART BUT HAD A WEAK MOUTH AND USUALLY REQUIRED THE LIFE WORK OF TWO GOOD WOMEN
7085-2327-0013 TO KEEP HIM FROM ULTIMATE DISASTER IT WAS PROBABLE ALETHIA CONSIDERED THAT ROBERT CAME INTO THE LAST CATEGORY IN WHICH CASE SHE WAS CERTAIN TO ENJOY THE COMPANIONSHIP OF ONE OR TWO EXCELLENT WOMEN AND MIGHT POSSIBLY CATCH GLIMPSES
7085-2327-0014 IN THE NOVEL SHE HAD JUST BEEN READING SO SHE RECOGNISED THAT SUCH A PROCEEDING WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THE TRAIN WHICH CARRIED ALETHIA TOWARDS HER DESTINATION WAS A LOCAL ONE WITH THE WAYSIDE STATION HABIT STRONGLY DEVELOPED
7085-2327-0015 AT MOST OF THE STATIONS NO ONE SEEMED TO WANT TO GET INTO THE TRAIN OR TO LEAVE IT BUT AT ONE THERE WERE SEVERAL MARKET FOLK ON THE PLATFORM AND TWO MEN OF THE FARMER OR SMALL CATTLE DEALER CLASS ENTERED ALETHIA'S CARRIAGE
7085-2327-0016 APPARENTLY THEY HAD JUST FOREGATHERED AFTER A DAY'S BUSINESS AND THEIR CONVERSATION CONSISTED OF A RAPID EXCHANGE OF SHORT FRIENDLY INQUIRIES AS TO HEALTH FAMILY STOCK AND SO FORTH AND SOME GRUMBLING REMARKS ON THE WEATHER
7085-2327-0017 SUDDENLY HOWEVER THEIR TALK TOOK A DRAMATICALLY INTERESTING TURN AND ALETHIA LISTENED WITH WIDE EYED ATTENTION
7085-2327-0018 DID YOU SEE THE WAY THE ARGUS SHOWED HIM UP THIS WEEK PROPERLY EXPOSED HIM HIP AND THIGH I TELL YOU AND SO ON THEY RAN IN THEIR WITHERING INDICTMENT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS ALETHIA'S COUSIN AND PROSPECTIVE HOST
7085-2327-0019 TO WHOM THEY WERE REFERRING THE ALLUSION TO A PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATURE SETTLED THAT WHAT COULD ROBERT BLUDWARD HAVE DONE WHAT MANNER OF MAN COULD HE BE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD SPEAK OF HIM WITH SUCH OBVIOUS REPROBATION
7085-2327-0020 HE WAS HISSED DOWN AT SHOALFORD YESTERDAY SAID ONE OF THE SPEAKERS
7085-2327-0021 NOW ALETHIA CAME TO THINK OF IT IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER OF MATTERBY TOWERS WHILE IN THE ACT OF OPENING A WESLEYAN BAZAAR BECAUSE HE WAS SUSPECTED UNJUSTLY AS IT TURNED OUT AFTERWARDS OF HAVING BEATEN THE GERMAN GOVERNESS TO DEATH
7085-2327-0022 WHAT MANNER OF EVILDOER WAS ROBERT BLUDWARD THE TRAIN STOPPED AT ANOTHER SMALL STATION AND THE TWO MEN GOT OUT ONE OF THEM LEFT BEHIND HIM A COPY OF THE ARGUS THE LOCAL PAPER TO WHICH HE HAD MADE REFERENCE
7085-2327-0023 AND THIS MONSTER WAS GOING TO MEET HER AT DERRELTON STATION IN A FEW SHORT MINUTES SHE WOULD KNOW HIM AT ONCE HE WOULD HAVE THE DARK BEETLING BROWS THE QUICK FURTIVE GLANCE
7085-2327-0024 THE SNEERING UNSAVOURY SMILE THAT ALWAYS CHARACTERISED THE SIR JASPERS OF THIS WORLD IT WAS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE SHE MUST FORCE HERSELF TO MEET HIM WITH OUTWARD CALM
7085-2327-0025 IT WAS A CONSIDERABLE SHOCK TO HER TO FIND THAT ROBERT WAS FAIR WITH A SNUB NOSE MERRY EYE AND RATHER A SCHOOLBOY MANNER A SERPENT IN DUCKLING'S PLUMAGE WAS HER PRIVATE COMMENT
7085-2327-0026 AS THEY DROVE AWAY FROM THE STATION A DISSIPATED LOOKING MAN OF THE LABOURING CLASS WAVED HIS HAT IN FRIENDLY SALUTE GOOD LUCK TO YOU MISTER BLUDWARD HE SHOUTED YOU'LL COME OUT ON TOP
7085-2327-0027 SO THESE WERE THE SORT OF ASSOCIATES THAT ROBERT BLUDWARD CONSORTED WITH THOUGHT ALETHIA WHO IS THE PERSON HE REFERRED TO AS OLD CHOBHAM SHE ASKED SIR JOHN CHOBHAM THE MAN WHO IS OPPOSING ME
7085-2327-0028 ANSWERED ROBERT THAT IS HIS HOUSE AWAY THERE AMONG THE TREES ON THE RIGHT SO THERE WAS AN UPRIGHT MAN POSSIBLY A VERY HUGO IN CHARACTER WHO WAS THWARTING AND DEFYING THE EVILDOER IN HIS NEFARIOUS CAREER
7085-2327-0029 GAVE THEM NO VERY FRIENDLY LOOKS AND ALETHIA THOUGHT SHE HEARD A FURTIVE HISS A MOMENT LATER THEY CAME UPON AN ERRAND BOY RIDING A BICYCLE HE HAD THE FRANK OPEN COUNTENANCE NEATLY BRUSHED HAIR AND TIDY CLOTHES
7085-2327-0030 THAT BETOKEN A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND A GOOD MOTHER HE STARED STRAIGHT AT THE OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR AND AFTER HE HAD PASSED THEM SANG IN HIS CLEAR BOYISH VOICE
7085-2327-0031 ROBERT MERELY LAUGHED THAT WAS HOW HE TOOK THE SCORN AND CONDEMNATION OF HIS FELLOW MEN HE HAD GOADED THEM TO DESPERATION WITH HIS SHAMELESS DEPRAVITY TILL THEY SPOKE OPENLY OF PUTTING HIM TO A VIOLENT DEATH
7085-2327-0032 AND HE LAUGHED MISSUS BLUDWARD PROVED TO BE OF THE TYPE THAT ALETHIA HAD SUSPECTED THIN LIPPED COLD EYED AND OBVIOUSLY DEVOTED TO HER WORTHLESS SON
7085-2327-0033 FROM HER NO HELP WAS TO BE EXPECTED ALETHIA LOCKED HER DOOR THAT NIGHT AND PLACED SUCH RAMPARTS OF FURNITURE AGAINST IT THAT THE MAID HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN BREAKING IN WITH THE EARLY TEA IN THE MORNING
7085-2327-0034 AFTER BREAKFAST ALETHIA ON THE PRETEXT OF GOING TO LOOK AT AN OUTLYING ROSE GARDEN SLIPPED AWAY TO THE VILLAGE THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING SHE REMEMBERED
7085-2327-0035 A GRAPHIC TWELVE DAYS OLD A YET OLDER COPY OF PUNCH AND ONE OR TWO LOCAL PAPERS LAY UPON THE CENTRAL TABLE THE OTHER TABLES WERE STACKED FOR THE MOST PART WITH CHESS AND DRAUGHTS BOARDS AND WOODEN BOXES OF CHESSMEN AND DOMINOES
7085-2327-0036 LISTLESSLY SHE PICKED UP ONE OF THE PAPERS THE SENTINEL AND GLANCED AT ITS CONTENTS SUDDENLY SHE STARTED AND BEGAN TO READ WITH BREATHLESS ATTENTION A PROMINENTLY PRINTED ARTICLE HEADED A LITTLE LIMELIGHT ON SIR JOHN CHOBHAM
7085-2327-0037 A LOOK OF FRIGHTENED DESPAIR CREPT INTO HER EYES NEVER IN ANY NOVEL THAT SHE HAD READ HAD A DEFENCELESS YOUNG WOMAN BEEN CONFRONTED WITH A SITUATION LIKE THIS SIR JOHN THE HUGO OF HER IMAGINATION WAS
7085-2327-0038 IF ANYTHING RATHER MORE DEPRAVED AND DESPICABLE THAN ROBERT BLUDWARD HE WAS MEAN EVASIVE CALLOUSLY INDIFFERENT TO HIS COUNTRY'S INTERESTS A CHEAT
7085-2327-0039 HENCE NO DOUBT THE RIVALRY AND ENMITY BETWEEN THESE OTHERWISE KINDRED SOULS ONE WAS SEEKING TO HAVE HIS ENEMY DONE TO DEATH THE OTHER WAS APPARENTLY TRYING TO STIR UP HIS SUPPORTERS TO AN ACT OF LYNCH LAW
7085-2327-0040 ALL THIS IN ORDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN UNOPPOSED ELECTION THAT ONE OR OTHER OF THE CANDIDATES MIGHT GO INTO PARLIAMENT WITH HONEYED ELOQUENCE ON HIS LIPS
7085-2327-0041 WERE MEN REALLY SO VILE I MUST GO BACK TO WEBBLEHINTON AT ONCE ALETHIA INFORMED HER ASTONISHED HOSTESS AT LUNCH TIME I HAVE HAD A TELEGRAM A FRIEND IS VERY SERIOUSLY ILL AND I HAVE BEEN SENT FOR
7085-2327-0042 IT WAS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO CONCOCT LIES BUT IT WOULD BE MORE DREADFUL TO HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT UNDER THAT ROOF ALETHIA READS NOVELS NOW WITH EVEN GREATER APPRECIATION THAN BEFORE SHE HAS BEEN HERSELF
7085-2327-0043 IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE WEBBLEHINTON THE WORLD WHERE THE GREAT DRAMAS OF SIN AND VILLAINY ARE PLAYED UNCEASINGLY
7085-2327-0044 BUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF SHE HAD GONE UNSUSPECTINGLY TO VISIT SIR JOHN CHOBHAM AND WARN HIM OF HIS DANGER
