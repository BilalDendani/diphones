7061-85640-0000 AILBE'S BABYHOOD THIS IS THE STORY OF A POOR LITTLE IRISH BABY
7061-85640-0001 BUT BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT SELL HIM NOR GIVE HIM AWAY THEY TRIED TO LOSE HIM THEY WRAPPED HIM IN A PIECE OF CLOTH AND TOOK HIM UP ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AND THERE THEY LEFT HIM LYING ALL ALONE ON A BUSH OF HEATHER
7061-85640-0002 NOW AN OLD MOTHER WOLF WAS OUT TAKING HER EVENING WALK ON THE MOUNTAIN AFTER TENDING HER CUBS IN THE DEN ALL DAY AND AS SHE WAS PASSING THE HEATHER BUSH SHE HEARD A FAINT FUNNY LITTLE CRY SHE PRICKED UP HER POINTED EARS AND SAID WHAT'S THAT
7061-85640-0003 FOR SHE THOUGHT OF HER OWN LITTLE ONES AT HOME AND HOW SAD IT WOULD BE TO SEE THEM SO HELPLESS AND LONELY AND FORGOTTEN SO SHE PICKED THE BABY UP IN HER MOUTH CAREFULLY AND RAN WITH HIM TO HER DEN IN THE ROCKS AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN
7061-85640-0004 NOW ONE DAY A YEAR OR TWO AFTER THIS A HUNTER CAME RIDING OVER THE MOUNTAIN ON HIS WAY HOME FROM THE CHASE
7061-85640-0005 BESIDES IT DID NOT HOP THE HUNTER JUMPED DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND RAN AFTER THE FUNNY ANIMAL TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS HIS LONG LEGS SOON OVERTOOK IT IN A CLUMP OF BUSHES WHERE IT WAS HIDING
7061-85640-0006 AND IMAGINE THE HUNTER'S SURPRISE WHEN HE FOUND THAT IT HAD NEITHER FUR NOR HORNS NOR FOUR FEET NOR A TAIL BUT THAT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHILD WHO COULD NOT STAND UPRIGHT AND WHOSE LITTLE BARE BODY RAN ON ALL FOURS LIKE A BABY WOLF
7061-85640-0007 BUT HE WAS NOT QUITE ABLE THE HUNTER THOUGHT AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD CARRY THE POOR LITTLE THING HOME TO HIS KIND WIFE THAT SHE MIGHT TAKE CARE OF HIM
7061-85640-0008 SO HE SCREAMED AND STRUGGLED TO GET AWAY FROM THE BIG HUNTER
7061-85640-0009 NOR GET BACK HER ADOPTED SON THE LITTLE SMOOTH SKINNED FOUNDLING SO AFTER FOLLOWING THEM FOR MILES THE FIVE WOLVES GRADUALLY DROPPED FARTHER AND FARTHER BEHIND AND AT LAST AS HE STRETCHED OUT HIS LITTLE ARMS TO THEM OVER THE HUNTER'S VELVET SHOULDER
7061-85640-0010 PANTING WITH ONE LAST HOWL OF FAREWELL THEY HAD GIVEN UP THE HOPELESS CHASE AND WITH THEIR TAILS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS AND THEIR HEADS DROOPING LOW THEY SLUNK BACK TO THEIR LONELY DEN WHERE THEY WOULD NEVER SEE THEIR LITTLE BOY PLAYMATE ANY MORE
7061-85640-0011 BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A BAD CRUEL WOMAN HIS SECOND MOTHER WAS THE KIND WOLF AND THIS ONE THE THIRD WAS A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS FOR THE HUNTER WHO HAD FOUND THE CHILD WAS A PRINCE AND HE LIVED IN A GRAND CASTLE BY A LAKE NEAR TIPPERARY
7061-85640-0012 WITH HUNDREDS OF SERVANTS AND HORSES AND DOGS AND
7061-85640-0013 AND HERE HE LIVED AND WAS VERY HAPPY AND HERE HE LEARNED ALL THE THINGS WHICH IN THOSE DAYS MADE A LITTLE BOY GROW UP INTO A WISE AND GREAT MAN HE GREW SO WISE AND GREAT THAT HE WAS MADE A BISHOP AND HAD A PALACE OF HIS OWN IN THE TOWN OF EMLY
7061-85640-0014 NOR HIS FOUR FOOTED BROTHERS IN THEIR COATS OF GREY FUR AND SOMETIMES WHEN HIS VISITORS WERE STUPID AND STAYED A LONG TIME OR WHEN THEY ASKED TOO MANY QUESTIONS OR WHEN THEY MADE HIM PRESENTS WHICH HE DID NOT LIKE
7061-85640-0015 HE DID NOT SEE ANY SPORT IN KILLING POOR CREATURES IT WAS ALMOST NIGHT AND THE PEOPLE OF EMLY WERE OUT WATCHING FOR THE HUNTERS TO RETURN THE BISHOP WAS COMING DOWN THE VILLAGE STREET ON HIS WAY FROM CHURCH
7061-85640-0016 A SAD HOWL OF FEAR AND WEARINESS AND PAIN IT SPOKE A LANGUAGE WHICH HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN BUT HARDLY HAD HE TIME TO THINK AGAIN AND REMEMBER BEFORE DOWN THE VILLAGE STREET
7061-85640-0017 CAME A GAUNT FIGURE FLYING IN LONG LEAPS FROM THE FOREMOST DOGS WHO WERE SNAPPING AT HER HEELS IT WAS AILBE'S WOLF MOTHER HE RECOGNIZED HER AS SOON AS HE SAW HER GREEN EYES AND THE PATCH OF WHITE ON HER RIGHT FORELEG
7061-85640-0018 AND SHE RECOGNIZED HIM TOO HOW I CANNOT SAY FOR HE HAD CHANGED GREATLY SINCE SHE LAST SAW HIM A NAKED LITTLE SUN BROWNED BOY BUT AT ANY RATE IN HIS FINE ROBES OF PURPLE AND LINEN AND RICH LACE
7061-85640-0019 AND THE GOOD BISHOP WAS TRUE TO HER FOR HE DREW HIS BEAUTIFUL VELVET CLOAK ABOUT HER TIRED PANTING BODY AND LAID HIS HAND LOVINGLY ON HER HEAD THEN IN THE OTHER HE HELD UP HIS CROOK WARNINGLY TO KEEP BACK THE FEROCIOUS DOGS
7061-85640-0020 I WILL PROTECT THEE OLD MOTHER HE SAID TENDERLY WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND YOUNG AND FEEBLE THOU DIDST NOURISH AND CHERISH AND PROTECT ME AND NOW THAT THOU ART OLD AND GREY AND WEAK SHALL I NOT RENDER THE SAME LOVE AND CARE TO THEE
7061-85640-0021 NONE SHALL INJURE THEE THEN THE HUNTERS CAME TEARING UP ON THEIR FOAMING HORSES SOME WERE ANGRY AND WANTED EVEN NOW TO KILL THE POOR WOLF JUST AS THE DOGS DID WHICH WERE PROWLING ABOUT SNARLING WITH DISAPPOINTMENT
7061-85640-0022 HE FORBADE THEM TO TOUCH THE WOLF AND HE WAS SO POWERFUL AND WISE AND HOLY THAT THEY DARED NOT DISOBEY HIM BUT HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH SEEING THEIR PREY TAKEN OUT OF THEIR CLUTCHES BUT BEFORE THE HUNTERS AND THEIR DOGS RODE AWAY
7061-85640-0023 AND HE BADE ALL THE CURIOUS TOWNS FOLK WHO HAD GATHERED ABOUT HIM AND THE WOLF LISTEN HE REPEATED THE PROMISE WHICH HE HAD MADE TO THE WOLF AND WARNED EVERYONE HENCEFORTH NOT TO HURT HER OR HER CHILDREN EITHER IN THE VILLAGE OR IN THE WOODS OR ON THE MOUNTAIN
7061-85640-0024 AND TURNING TO HER ONCE MORE HE SAID SEE MOTHER YOU NEED NOT FEAR THEY DARE NOT HURT YOU NOW YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SON TO PROTECT YOU COME EVERY DAY WITH MY BROTHERS TO MY TABLE AND YOU AND YOURS SHALL SHARE MY FOOD AS ONCE I SO OFTEN SHARED YOURS
7061-85640-0025 AND SO IT WAS EVERY DAY AFTER THAT SO LONG AS SHE LIVED THE OLD WOLF MOTHER BROUGHT HER FOUR CHILDREN TO THE BISHOP'S PALACE AND HOWLED AT THE GATE FOR THE PORTER TO LET THEM IN AND EVERY DAY HE OPENED TO THEM AND THE STEWARD SHOWED THE FIVE INTO THE GREAT DINING HALL
7061-85640-0026 AND THERE WITH HER FIVE CHILDREN ABOUT HER IN A HAPPY CIRCLE THE KIND WOLF MOTHER SAT AND ATE THE GOOD THINGS WHICH THE BISHOP'S FRIENDS HAD SENT HIM BUT THE CHILD SHE LOVED BEST WAS NONE OF THOSE IN FURRY COATS AND FINE WHISKERS THAT LOOKED LIKE HER
7061-85640-0027 IT WAS THE BLUE EYED SAINT AT THE TOP OF THE TABLE IN HIS ROBES OF PURPLE AND WHITE
7061-85640-0028 WHAT A HANDSOME FAMILY WE ARE HE WOULD SAY AND
