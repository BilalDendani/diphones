7079-89644-0000 AFTER ALL I HAD PASSED THROUGH DURING THE PRECEDING TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEN TO BE SUDDENLY CAST FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS INTO A HOLE AS LIGHT AS IF ILLUMINATED BY THE MID DAY SUN WAS A REVELATION
7079-89644-0001 THAT CAUSED ME TO SERIOUSLY DOUBT MY OWN SENSES BUT HAVING SPENT A LIFE OF TRAVEL AND ADVENTURE IN WHICH I HAD FACED MANY UNEXPECTED DANGERS AND INEXPLICABLE SIGHTS
7079-89644-0002 I SOON REGAINED MY NORMAL PRESENCE OF MIND AND BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST I WAS NOW FULLY CONVINCED
7079-89644-0003 THAT THE GREAT PILE OF STONE WHICH I HAD SO STRANGELY REACHED HAD AT ONE TIME FORMED A GIGANTIC STRUCTURE MOULDED TOGETHER BY HUMAN INGENUITY THE ENCLOSURE I FOUND MYSELF WITHIN
7079-89644-0004 MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HALLWAY OF THE EDIFICE BUT IT WAS HARD TO POSITIVELY DISTINGUISH IT AS SUCH FOR THE BUILDING IN FALLING HAD PLACED THINGS IN AN ALMOST UNRECOGNIZABLE CONDITION SOME OF THE GREAT STONES FROM ABOVE
7079-89644-0005 HAD PASSED THROUGH THE CEILING AND FLOOR WHILE OTHERS HAD BECOME WEDGED TOGETHER BEFORE REACHING THE SURFACE THUS FORMING A VERY RAGGED AND PECULIAR APERTURE IN PLACES WHERE THERE WERE NO OBSTRUCTIONS
7079-89644-0006 I NOTICED A BEAUTIFUL WHITE MARBLE FLOOR
7079-89644-0007 THE SPACE I FOUND MYSELF IN WAS TOO IRREGULAR IN ITS OUTLINES TO FORM AN ADEQUATE IDEA OF WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED FOR IN SOME PLACES I HAD TO STOOP TO PASS ALONG
7079-89644-0008 WHILE IN OTHERS I WAS FORCED TO CLIMB OVER GREAT BLOCKS OF STONE AFTER BEING IN THIS PASSAGE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR MAKING AN INSPECTION OF THE PREMISES I DISCOVERED
7079-89644-0009 A SMALL OPENING WHICH LED INTO ANOTHER APARTMENT IT APPEARED THAT A GREAT DOOR HAD SEPARATED THE TWO ROOMS BUT HAD APPARENTLY BECOME BROKEN WITH THE FALL OF THE BUILDING AND LEFT A SPACE BARELY WIDE ENOUGH FOR MY BODY TO PASS THROUGH
7079-89644-0010 SO IN I WENT OR OUT I WENT I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHICH FOR AFTER SQUEEZING THROUGH THE DOORWAY A SCENE PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY ASTONISHED GAZE
7079-89644-0011 THAT I MUST CONFESS MY INABILITY TO PROPERLY DESCRIBE THE VIEW BEFORE ME WAS A MAMMOTH PARK WITH ITS VARIETY OF TREES FLOWERS AND SHRUBBERY OF EVERY POSSIBLE DESCRIPTION
7079-89644-0012 STRAIGHT AHEAD IN THE DISTANCE AND PLAINLY DISCERNIBLE WAS A RUNNING BROOK WHICH FLOWED ALONG IN A DEVIOUS COURSE AND EMPTIED INTO A LAKE FAR BEYOND AND THERE IN ALL ITS MAJESTY WAS THE SUN
7079-89644-0013 JUST SINKING BEHIND THE HORIZON ITS BRILLIANT RADIANCE FORMING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EFFECTS OF COLORIZATION UPON THE DISTANT CLOUDS IT HAS EVER BEEN MY GOOD FORTUNE TO BEHOLD I STOOD
7079-89644-0014 IN MOTIONLESS REVERENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AS MY MIND EXPANDED WITH WONDER AT THE MAGNIFICENT PANORAMA WHILE MY NOSTRILS INHALED
7079-89644-0015 A MOST DELICIOUS FRAGRANCE FROM THE INNUMERABLE PLANTS WHICH SEEMED TO PUT NEW LIFE INTO MY ENERVATED BODY WHAT STRANGE PHENOMENA IS THIS I SOLILOQUIZED
7079-89644-0016 ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE EARTH THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN AND DARKNESS PREVAILED WHILE DOWN HERE IN UNDER ITS CRUST I FOUND IT BLAZING AWAY IN ALL ITS SPLENDOR IN FACT IT SEEMED
7079-89644-0017 THAT AN ENTIRELY NEW WORLD HAD SUDDENLY BEEN THROWN IN FRONT OF ME WAS I REALLY ALIVE OR HAD I PASSED INTO SOME OTHER WORLD WAS THE NEXT QUESTION TO ENTER MY MIND
7079-89644-0018 I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD FALLEN A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE INTO THIS STRANGE PLACE AND WAS SOMEWHAT STUNNED IN THE TUMBLE
7079-89644-0019 PERHAPS THOUGHT I MY BODY IS STILL LYING SOMEWHERE AMONG THE ROCKS ABOVE WHILE THIS IS ONLY MY SPIRIT WANDERING ABOUT IN A FANCIFUL MANNER BUT NO
7079-89644-0020 LOOKING DOWNWARD I PLAINLY SAW MY MASSIVE FRAME DRESSED IN SAILOR'S CLOTHES JUST AS I HAD LEFT THE SHIP AND I WAS POSITIVE OF BEING ALIVE AWAKE AND IN MY RIGHT SENSES
7079-89644-0021 AND THE WONDERS MULTIPLIED
7079-89644-0022 I OBSERVED A MARBLE PLATFORM ELEVATED ABOUT TWO FEET FROM THE GROUND IN THE MIDST OF HUGE FLOWER BEDS AND SHADED BY LARGE TREES UPON WHICH SAT A NUMBER OF MEN SILENT AND MOTIONLESS
7079-89644-0023 WITH VARIOUS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN THEIR HANDS AS IF THEY HAD JUST FINISHED PLAYING AND WERE TAKING A SHORT REST THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PATTERN FROM ANY I HAD EVER SEEN AND THE MEN
7079-89644-0024 AS I SAW THEM WHAT AN IMPOSING NOBLE LOOKING LOT THEY WERE THEY WERE ALL ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND NOT ONE OF THEM COULD HAVE BEEN LESS THAN EIGHT FEET IN HEIGHT IN LOOKING AT THEM CLOSELY
7079-89644-0025 I NOTICED THAT THEY POSSESSED MOST MAGNIFICENT PHYSIQUES
7079-89644-0026 THEY WERE NEITHER FAT NOR LEAN AND THEIR WELL GROOMED BODIES SHOWED PLAINLY THAT NO HORSE OR PIECE OF MACHINERY EVER RECEIVED BETTER CARE OR ATTENTION WHILE THEY APPEARED TO BE FROM THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS IN AGES
7079-89644-0027 NOT ONE OF THEM WORE A MUSTACHE BEARD OR ANY OTHER SHAGGY DECORATION OF THE FACE THEIR FOREHEADS WERE BROAD AND MASSIVE AND EXTENDED TO THE CENTER OF THEIR SPLENDIDLY SHAPED CRANIUMS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLIGENCE
7079-89644-0028 KINDNESS AND GENTLENESS SHOWED FORTH FROM EVERY FEATURE OF THEIR HANDSOME COUNTENANCES JUDGING FROM THEIR WELL PROPORTIONED FRAMES EACH ONE LOOKED POWERFUL ENOUGH TO BATTLE SINGLE HANDED WITH AN ELEPHANT
7079-89644-0029 JUDGING FROM THEIR FACES NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE HURT A FLEA EACH MAN APPEARED TO BE BURIED IN THE DEPTH OF THOUGHT SERIOUS THOUGHT NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY PHYSIOGNOMY PLAINLY SHOWED
7079-89644-0030 THAT THE UTMOST HAPPINESS AND CONTENTMENT EXISTED WITHIN EACH AND GOOD WILL BETWEEN ALL OF THEM
7079-89644-0031 HANDS AND FEET WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW TRANSPARENT AND BACKED BY A BEAUTIFUL PINK AT FIRST SIGHT
7079-89644-0032 UNIFORMLY CLOTHED IN CLOSELY FITTING GARMENTS FROM THE ANKLES TO THE NECK THEIR SUPERB FORMS SHOWED COMPLETE SYMMETRICAL PERFECTION THE HUE OF THEIR RAIMENT WAS INDESCRIBABLE FOR I
7079-89644-0033 HAD NEVER SEEN THE LIKE BEFORE IN FACT THE COLORS ACTUALLY APPEARED TO CHANGE BEFORE MY STEADY GAZE THEIR FEET WERE BARE VERY SHAPELY AND THE TOES OF GREATER LENGTH THAN ORDINARILY
7079-89644-0034 AS I STOOD ROOTED TO THE GROUND AND VIEWED THEM WITH INTENSE ADMIRATION I WONDERED WHY THEY DID NOT SPEAK OR TAKE NOTICE OF MY PRESENCE
7079-89644-0035 I SHOUTED HELLO MY VOICE SOUNDED RATHER HARSH AND PECULIAR ON THIS OCCASION AND WAS MORE LIKE THE BRAY OF AN ASS THAN ANYTHING ELSE BUT THEY MADE NO MOTION AS IF THEY HEARD ME OR WERE AWARE OF MY EXISTENCE
7079-89644-0036 WALKING OVER TO THE NEAREST ONE I REACHED UP AND TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER THEN I SPRANG BACK IN AMAZEMENT FOR INSTEAD OF GIVING ANY SIGN OF RECOGNITION HE MERELY PLACED HIS INSTRUMENT IN POSITION AS DID ALL THE OTHERS
7079-89644-0037 AND WITH SLOW GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS BEGAN TO PLAY THE FIRST STRAINS OF MUSIC
7079-89644-0038 ALTHOUGH DISTINCT AND SUPERNATURALLY GRAND SEEMED TO BE MILES AWAY BUT GRADUALLY INCREASED IN SOUND AS IF COMING NEARER AND NEARER AT THE SAME TIME I OBSERVED THAT THE MUSICIANS
7079-89644-0039 WHO WERE NOT ONLY USING BOTH HANDS IN THE MANIPULATION OF THEIR INSTRUMENTS BUT WITH GRACEFUL DEXTERITY THEIR FEET AS WELL WERE BECOMING ENTHUSIASTIC AND APPEARED TO THROW THEIR VERY LIVES AND SOULS INTO THE WORK IF
7079-89644-0040 AT FIRST WHILE INACTIVE THEY APPEARED TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY INTELLECTUAL BEINGS NOW IN ACTION THEY LOOKED DIVINE THEIR EYES BLAZED LIKE MINIATURE SUNS SHOOTING FORTH SPARKS OF A THOUSAND DIFFERENT HUES
7079-89644-0041 IT SEEMED AS IF THE VERY MUSIC ITSELF CAME FROM THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR FACES AND ON ON ON CAME THE INTOXICATING STRAINS INCREASING IN VOLUME AND EXCELLENCE UNTIL I IMAGINED
7079-89644-0042 THAT ALL HEAVEN HAD BROKEN LOOSE IN ONE GREAT EFFORT TO CHARM MY FEEBLE SENSES AND THEN WITH A THUNDEROUS CLIMAX IT CEASED INSTANTLY THE MUSICIANS SMILED AND BOWED PLEASANTLY TO ONE ANOTHER AND THEN
7079-89644-0043 RESUMED THEIR FORMER ATTITUDES NO MORTAL'S PEN COULD DESCRIBE MY ECSTASY WHILE LISTENING TO THE MUSIC PRODUCED BY THIS BODY OF I MUST SAY HEAVENLY CREATURES
7079-89644-0044 THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE AND ANALOGOUS ABOUT IT TOO THAT SEEMED TO RECALL A MYSTERIOUS DREAM OR VISION I HAD ONCE PASSED THROUGH WHETHER IT WAS CAUSED BY
7079-89644-0045 THE MUSIC OR THE KINDLY EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER ON THE FACES OF THE PLAYERS I KNOW NOT BUT NEVERTHELESS GREAT TEARS SPONTANEOUSLY ROLLED DOWN MY CHEEKS
7079-89644-0046 THE FIRST I EVER RECOLLECT HAVING SHED AND AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PIECE I REMAINED TRANSFIXED TO THE SPOT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IN DEEP COGITATION ONCE MORE HOWEVER
7079-89644-0047 MY INQUIRING NATURE AROUSED ME AND I WALKED OVER TOWARD THE LEADER HIS FACE WAS TURNED SLIGHTLY IN ANOTHER DIRECTION SO I DECIDED TO STEP UP ON THE PLATFORM GET SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HIM
7079-89644-0048 AND LOOK STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES SO WITH A LIGHT MOVEMENT I SPRANG FOR THE ROSTRUM BUT INSTEAD OF REACHING IT MY FOOT AND HEAD STRUCK NOT THE PLATFORM BUT SOLID WALL
7079-89644-0049 AND A SECOND LATER I FOUND MYSELF IN A HEAP ON THE GROUND
