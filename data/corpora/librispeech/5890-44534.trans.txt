5890-44534-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO A PRISONER AFTER SOME CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE LEADERS
5890-44534-0001 IT WAS KNOWN TO POSSESS A GARRISON OF SOME SIXTY MEN ONLY AND ALTHOUGH STRONG
5890-44534-0002 AND TAKING TWO MOUNTED RETAINERS HE STARTED THE FORCE REMAINING IN THE FOREST SOME EIGHT MILES DISTANT
5890-44534-0003 I WILL RIDE HE SAID CLOSE UP TO THE CASTLE WALLS MY ARMOUR IS GOOD AND I CARE NOT FOR ARROW OR CROSSBOW BOLT IT WERE BEST YOU FELL BACK
5890-44534-0004 ARCHIE THEN RODE FORWARD TOWARD THE CASTLE
5890-44534-0005 HE TURNED ASIDE AND RODE TO THE EDGE OF THE FOSSE THAT THEY SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A FOE RUNNING TO THE WALLS THEY OPENED FIRE WITH ARROWS UPON HIM BUT BY THIS TIME ARCHIE HAD SEEN ALL THAT HE REQUIRED
5890-44534-0006 ACROSS THE PROMONTORY RAN A SORT OF FISSURE SOME TEN YARDS WIDE AND AS MANY DEEP FROM THE OPPOSITE EDGE OF THIS THE WALL ROSE ABRUPTLY
5890-44534-0007 SEVERAL ARROWS HAD STRUCK HIS ARMOUR AND GLANCED OFF AND ARCHIE NOW TURNED AND QUIETLY RODE AWAY HIS HORSE BEING PROTECTED BY MAIL LIKE HIMSELF
5890-44534-0008 COMING AT FULL GALLOP TOWARD THE PROMONTORY WAS A STRONG BODY OF ENGLISH HORSE FLYING THE BANNER OF SIR INGRAM DE UMFRAVILLE
5890-44534-0009 AND DRAWING HIS SWORD HE GALLOPED AT FULL SPEED TO MEET THEM AS HE NEARED THEM SIR INGRAM HIMSELF ONE OF THE DOUGHTIEST OF EDWARD'S KNIGHTS RODE OUT WITH LEVELLED LANCE TO MEET HIM AT FULL GALLOP THE KNIGHTS CHARGED EACH OTHER
5890-44534-0010 STRIKING THE KNIGHT FORWARD ON TO HIS HORSE'S NECK
5890-44534-0011 SUCH A CONFLICT COULD NOT LAST LONG
5890-44534-0012 WHEN HE RECOVERED HE WAS IN A ROOM IN THE KEEP OF THE CASTLE TWO KNIGHTS WERE SITTING AT A TABLE NEAR THE COUCH ON WHICH HE WAS LYING AH EXCLAIMED ONE ON SEEING ARCHIE OPEN HIS EYES AND MOVE I AM GLAD TO SEE YOUR SENSES COMING BACK TO YOU SIR PRISONER
5890-44534-0013 SEEING THAT IN THIS WAR WE MUST NEEDS SEND OUR PRISONERS TO KING EDWARD WHOSE TREATMENT OF THEM IS NOT I MUST E E N OWN GENTLE FOR INDEED YOU FOUGHT LIKE ANY PALADIN I DEEMED NOT THAT THERE WAS A KNIGHT IN SCOTLAND SAVE THE BRUCE HIMSELF
5890-44534-0014 WHO COULD HAVE SO BORNE HIMSELF AND NEVER DID I INGRAM DE UMFRAVILLE
5890-44534-0015 MY HEAD RINGS WITH IT STILL MY HELMET WILL NEVER BE FIT TO WEAR AGAIN AND AS THE LEECH SAID WHEN PLASTERING MY HEAD HAD NOT MY SKULL BEEN OF THE THICKEST YOU HAD ASSUREDLY CUT THROUGH IT

5890-44534-0017 THERE IS NONE IN THE SCOTTISH RANKS AGAINST WHOM KING EDWARD IS SO BITTER
5890-44534-0018 AND NOW UNDER BRUCE IT IS EVER COMING TO THE FRONT
5890-44534-0019 NEVERTHELESS SIR KNIGHT I WILL SEND TO KING EDWARD BEGGING HIM TO LOOK MERCIFULLY UPON YOUR CASE SEEING HOW BRAVELY AND HONOURABLY YOU HAVE FOUGHT THANKS FOR YOUR GOOD OFFICES SIR INGRAM
5890-44534-0020 HAVE FOUGHT FOR MY COUNTRY AGAINST A FOREIGN ENEMY BUT KING EDWARD DOES NOT HOLD HIMSELF TO BE A FOREIGN ENEMY THE KNIGHT SAID
5890-44534-0021 IT WERE AN EASY WAY ARCHIE REJOINED TO GAIN A POSSESSION TO NOMINATE A PUPPET FROM AMONG THE NOBLES ALREADY YOUR VASSALS
5890-44534-0022 BUT I OWN TO YOU THAT SEEING I HAVE FOUGHT BESIDE HIM IN GASCONY WHEN HE AS A FEUDAL VASSAL OF THE KING OF FRANCE MADE WAR UPON HIS LORD I CANNOT SEE THAT THE OFFENCE IS AN UNPARDONABLE ONE WHEN YOU SCOTCHMEN DO THE SAME HERE
5890-44534-0023 HOWEVER SIR I REGRET MUCH THAT YOU HAVE FALLEN INTO MY HANDS FOR TO CARLISLE
5890-44534-0024 I MUST FORTHWITH SEND YOU I MUST LEAVE YOU HERE WITH THE GOVERNOR FOR IN HALF AN HOUR I MOUNT AND RIDE AWAY WITH MY TROOP HE WILL DO HIS BEST TO MAKE YOUR SOJOURN HERE EASY UNTIL SUCH TIME AS I MAY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF SENDING YOU BY SHIP TO CARLISLE AND NOW FAREWELL SIR HE SAID GIVING ARCHIE HIS HAND
5890-44534-0025 THANKS SIR INGRAM ARCHIE REPLIED I HAVE EVER HEARD OF YOU AS A BRAVE KNIGHT AND IF THIS MISFORTUNE MUST FALL UPON ME
5890-44534-0026 THE GOVERNOR NOW HAD A MEAL WITH SOME WINE SET BEFORE ARCHIE AND THEN LEFT HIM ALONE I AM NOT AT CARLISLE YET ARCHIE SAID TO HIMSELF UNLESS I MISTAKE WE SHALL HAVE SIR JAMES THUNDERING AT THE GATE BEFORE MORNING
5890-44534-0027 AND E E N NOW HE WILL BE MARCHING TOWARDS THE CASTLE
5890-44534-0028 A PRODIGIOUS UPROAR RAGED IN THE CASTLE
5890-44534-0029 THREE OR FOUR MINUTES LATER THE GOVERNOR WITH SIX SOLDIERS TWO OF WHOM BORE TORCHES ENTERED THE ROOM YOU MUST COME ALONG AT ONCE SIR KNIGHT THE GOVERNOR SAID
5890-44534-0030 IT WAS IN VAIN FOR ARCHIE TO THINK OF RESISTANCE HE WAS UNARMED AND HELPLESS TWO OF THE SOLDIERS LAID HANDS ON HIM AND HURRIED HIM ALONG UNTIL THEY REACHED THE LOWER CHAMBERS OF THE CASTLE THE GOVERNOR UNLOCKED A DOOR AND WITH ONE OF THE TORCH BEARERS LED THE WAY DOWN SOME NARROW STEPS
5890-44534-0031 ANOTHER DOOR WAS OPENED AND THE FRESH BREEZE BLEW UPON THEM AS THEY ISSUED FORTH
5890-44534-0032 ARCHIE AND THE SIX SOLDIERS ENTERED HER FOUR OF THE LATTER TOOK THE OARS
5890-44534-0033 WITH MUTTERED CURSES THE MEN BENT TO THEIR OARS AND EVERY MINUTE TOOK THEM FURTHER AWAY FROM KNOCKBAWN
5890-44534-0034 AND THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS BEING SENT OFF BY SEA HAD NOT ENTERED HIS MIND
5890-44534-0035 HE HAD NOTICED ON EMBARKING THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER BOATS LYING AT THE FOOT OF THE PROMONTORY AND PURSUIT WOULD THEREFORE BE IMPOSSIBLE
5890-44534-0036 WHERE ARCHIE WAS DELIVERED BY THE SOLDIERS TO THE GOVERNOR WITH A MESSAGE FROM THEIR COMMANDER SAYING THAT THE PRISONER SIR ARCHIBALD FORBES WAS A CAPTIVE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND WAS BY THE ORDERS OF SIR INGRAM DE UMFRAVILLE WHO HAD CAPTURED HIM
5890-44534-0037 TO BE SENT ON TO CARLISLE TO THE KING WHEN A SHIP SHOULD BE GOING THITHER A FORTNIGHT PASSED BEFORE A VESSEL SAILED ARCHIE WAS PLACED IN IRONS AND SO SECURELY GUARDED IN HIS DUNGEON THAT ESCAPE WAS ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE
5890-44534-0038 THE WINDS WERE CONTRARY AND THE VESSEL WAS TEN DAYS UPON THE VOYAGE
5890-44534-0039 THE AGED MONARCH IN THE LAST EXTREMITY OF SICKNESS LAY UPON A COUCH SEVERAL OF HIS NOBLES STOOD AROUND HIM SO HE SAID AS THE PRISONER WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM THIS IS ARCHIBALD FORBES THE ONE COMPANION OF THE TRAITOR WALLACE WHO HAS HITHERTO ESCAPED MY VENGEANCE
5890-44534-0040 SO YOUNG SIR YOU HAVE VENTURED TO BRAVE MY ANGER AND TO THINK YOURSELF CAPABLE OF COPING WITH THE LION OF ENGLAND I HAVE DONE MY UTMOST SIR KING ARCHIE SAID FIRMLY SUCH AS IT WAS FOR THE FREEDOM OF MY COUNTRY
5890-44534-0041 NOR I EVER TOOK VOW OF ALLEGIANCE TO YOU MAINTAINING EVER THAT THE KINGS OF ENGLAND HAD NEITHER CLAIM NOR RIGHT OVER SCOTLAND
5890-44534-0042 BUT OTHERS WILL TAKE OUR PLACES AND SO THE FIGHT WILL GO ON UNTIL SCOTLAND IS FREE SCOTLAND WILL NEVER BE FREE THE KING SAID WITH ANGRY VEHEMENCE
5890-44534-0043 MAN WOMAN OR CHILD TO BEAR THE NAME
5890-44534-0044 WITH THESE WORDS ARCHIE TURNED AND WALKED PROUDLY FROM THE KING'S PRESENCE AN INVOLUNTARY MURMUR OF ADMIRATION AT HIS FEARLESS BEARING ESCAPED FROM THE KNIGHTS AND NOBLES ASSEMBLED ROUND THE COUCH OF THE DYING MONARCH
5890-44534-0045 WHEN TWO DAYS LATER ARCHIE ENTERED THE GATES OF BERWICK CASTLE THE BELLS OF THE CITY WERE TOLLING FOR A HORSEMAN HAD JUST RIDDEN IN WITH THE NEWS THAT EDWARD HAD EXPIRED ON THE EVENING BEFORE
5890-44534-0046 HIS BODY SHOULD BE BOILED IN A CAULDRON UNTIL THE FLESH SHOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE BONES AFTER WHICH THE FLESH SHOULD BE COMMITTED TO THE EARTH BUT THE BONES PRESERVED AND THAT AS OFTEN AS THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND REBELLED
5890-44534-0047 HIS HEART HE DIRECTED SHOULD BE CONVEYED TO AND DEPOSITED IN THE HOLY LAND
5890-44534-0048 IN MANY RESPECTS HIS REIGN WAS A GREAT AND GLORIOUS ONE FOR HE WAS MORE THAN A GREAT CONQUEROR HE WAS TO ENGLAND A WISE AND NOBLE KING
5890-44534-0049 GREATEST OF THE PLANTAGENETS HISTORIANS HAVE STRIVEN TO EXCUSE AND PALLIATE HIS CONDUCT TOWARD SCOTLAND
5890-44534-0050 WHICH HAD NOT A SHADOW OF FOUNDATION SAVE FROM THE SUBMISSION OF HER ANGLO NORMAN NOBLES ALMOST ALL OF WHOM WERE HIS OWN VASSALS AND OWNED ESTATES IN ENGLAND WERE JUST AND RIGHTEOUS SUCH IS NOT THE TRUE FUNCTION OF HISTORY
5890-44534-0051 EDWARD'S SOLE CLAIM TO SCOTLAND WAS THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO UNITE UNDER HIS RULE ENGLAND SCOTLAND WALES AND IRELAND
