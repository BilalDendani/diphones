4447-14912-0000 THE POINTER IT HAS NEVER BEEN MADE QUITE CLEAR IN HISTORY WHY THE SPANIARDS HAD A DOG THAT WAS VERY REMARKABLE FOR POINTING ALL KINDS OF GAME
4447-14912-0001 SINGULARLY ENOUGH TOO THE MOST ESTEEMED BREEDS IN MANY COUNTRIES CAN BE TRACED FROM THE SAME SOURCE SUCH AS THE RUSSIAN POINTER THE GERMAN POINTER THE FRENCH DOUBLE NOSED GRIFFON AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT STILL THE ENGLISH POINTER
4447-14912-0002 A VIEW HAS BEEN TAKEN THAT THE SPANISH DOUBLE NOSED POINTER WAS INTRODUCED INTO ENGLAND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN FIRE ARMS WERE BEGINNING TO BE POPULAR FOR FOWLING PURPOSES SETTERS AND SPANIELS HAD BEEN USED TO FIND AND DRIVE BIRDS INTO NETS
4447-14912-0003 BUT AS THE SPANISH POINTER BECAME KNOWN IT WAS APPARENTLY CONSIDERED THAT HE ALONE HAD THE CAPACITY TO FIND GAME FOR THE GUN THIS MUST HAVE BEEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
4447-14912-0004 AND FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS AT LEAST SOMETHING VERY SLOW WAS WANTED TO MEET THE NECESSITIES OF THE OLD FASHIONED FLINTLOCK GUN WHICH OCCUPIED MANY MINUTES IN LOADING AND GETTING INTO POSITION
4447-14912-0005 IMPROVEMENTS CAME BY DEGREES UNTIL THEY SET IN VERY RAPIDLY BUT PROBABLY BY SEVENTEEN FIFTY WHEN HUNTING HAD PROGRESSED A GOOD DEAL AND PACE WAS INCREASED IN ALL PASTIMES
4447-14912-0006 THE OLD FASHIONED POINTER WAS VOTED A NUISANCE THROUGH HIS EXTREME CAUTION AND TORTOISE LIKE MOVEMENTS THERE IS EVIDENCE THROUGH PORTRAITS THAT POINTERS HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER CHANGED BY THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED
4447-14912-0007 BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE BREED THEN HAD BEEN CONTINUED BY SELECTION RATHER THAN BY CROSSING FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES AS IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT BY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN SPORTSMEN WERE STILL DISSATISFIED WITH THE WANT OF PACE IN THE POINTER
4447-14912-0008 AND MANY SPORTSMEN ARE KNOWN TO HAVE CROSSED THEIR POINTERS WITH FOXHOUNDS AT ABOUT THAT TIME BY EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE THE OLD SPANISH POINTER HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND THE ENGLISH DOG WAS A PERFECT MODEL FOR PACE STAMINA
4447-14912-0009 RESOLUTION AND NERVE THE BREED WAS EXACTLY ADAPTED TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT DAY WHICH WAS NOT QUITE AS FAST AS THE PRESENT MEN SHOT WITH GOOD JOE MANTONS DID THEIR OWN LOADING
4447-14912-0010 THE DOGS BEAT THEIR GROUND METHODICALLY THEIR HEADS AT THE RIGHT LEVEL FOR BODY SCENT AND WHEN THEY CAME ON GAME DOWN THEY WERE THE DOG THAT HAD GOT IT POINTING AND THE OTHER BARKING OR AWAITING DEVELOPMENTS
4447-14912-0011 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE WORK OF A WELL BRED AND WELL BROKEN BRACE OF POINTERS OR MORE PERFECT THAN THE WAY A MAN GOT HIS SHOTS FROM THEM THERE WAS NOTHING SLOW ABOUT THEM
4447-14912-0012 THE TRUTH OF IT WAS THAT THE CAPACITY TO CONCENTRATE THE WHOLE ATTENTION ON THE OBJECT FOUND WAS SO INTENSE AS TO HAVE LESSENED EVERY OTHER PROPENSITY THE RUSH OF THE FOXHOUND HAD BEEN ABSORBED BY THE ADDITIONAL FORCE OF THE POINTER CHARACTER
4447-14912-0013 AND ALTHOUGH SETTERS HAD BEEN GETTING INTO EQUAL REPUTE FOR THE BEAUTY OF THEIR WORK THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE BRILLIANT ABOUT THE POINTERS AT FIRST BROCKTON'S BOUNCE WAS A MAGNIFICENT DOG A WINNER ON THE SHOW BENCH AND OF THE FIRST FIELD TRIAL IN ENGLAND
4447-14912-0014 NEWTON'S RANGER WAS ANOTHER OF THE EARLY PERFORMERS AND HE WAS VERY STAUNCH AND BRILLIANT BUT IT WAS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THAT THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY POINTER MERIT WAS SEEN AS QUITE INCOMPARABLE WAS SIR RICHARD GARTH'S DRAKE
4447-14912-0015 WHO WAS JUST FIVE GENERATIONS FROM THE SPANISH POINTER DRAKE WAS RATHER A TALL GAUNT DOG BUT WITH IMMENSE DEPTH OF GIRTH LONG SHOULDERS LONG HAUNCHES AND A BENEVOLENT QUIET COUNTENANCE
4447-14912-0016 THERE WAS NOTHING VERY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT HIM WHEN WALKING ABOUT AT STAFFORD PRIOR TO HIS TRIAL BUT THE MOMENT HE WAS DOWN
4447-14912-0017 AS HE WENT HALF AS FAST AGAIN IT WAS CALCULATED THAT HE WENT FIFTY MILES AN HOUR AND AT THIS TREMENDOUS PACE HE WOULD STOP AS IF PETRIFIED AND THE MOMENTUM WOULD COVER HIM WITH EARTH AND DUST HE DID NOT SEEM CAPABLE OF MAKING A MISTAKE
4447-14912-0018 AND HIS BIRDS WERE ALWAYS AT ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM HIM TO SHOW THEREBY HIS EXTRAORDINARY NOSE AND CONFIDENCE NOTHING IN HIS DAY COULD BEAT HIM IN A FIELD HE GOT SOME GOOD STOCK BUT THEY WERE NOT GENERALLY SHOW FORM
4447-14912-0019 THE BITCHES BY HIM BEING MOSTLY LIGHT AND SMALL AND HIS SONS A BIT HIGH ON THE LEG NONE OF THEM HAD HIS PACE BUT SOME WERE CAPITAL PERFORMERS SUCH AS SIR THOMAS LENNARD'S MALLARD MISTER GEORGE PILKINGTON'S TORY
4447-14912-0020 MISTER LLOYD PRICE'S LUCK OF EDENHALL WINNER OF THE FIELD TRIAL DERBY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT LORD DOWNE'S MARS AND BOUNCE AND MISTER BARCLAY FIELD'S RIOT WHEN SIR RICHARD GARTH WENT TO INDIA AND SOLD HIS KENNEL OF POINTERS AT TATTERSALL'S
4447-14912-0021 THE MID CENTURY OWNERS AND BREEDERS HAD PROBABLY ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF WHAT A PAST GENERATION HAD DONE AS THERE WERE CERTAINLY MANY WONDERFUL POINTERS IN THE FIFTIES SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES AS OLD MEN LIVING TO DAY WILL FREELY ALLOW
4447-14912-0022 THEY WERE PRODUCED VERY REGULARLY TOO IN A MARVELLOUS TYPE OF PERFECTION MISTER WILLIAM ARKWRIGHT OF SUTTON SCARSDALE DERBYSHIRE HAS PROBABLY THE BEST KENNEL IN ENGLAND AT THE PRESENT TIME
4447-14912-0023 HE DISCOVERED AND REVIVED AN OLD BREED OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THAT WAS BLACK AND BRED FOR A GREAT MANY YEARS BY MISTER PAPE OF CARLISLE AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM WITH THESE MISTER ARKWRIGHT HAS BRED
4447-14912-0024 AND THE BRACKENBURG ROMPS AND HIS HAVE BEEN AMONGST THE BEST AT THE SHOWS AND THE FIELD TRIALS DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS THERE ARE OF COURSE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE THAT MANY OF THE MODERN POINTERS DO NOT CARRY ABOUT THEM THE AIR OF THEIR TRUE BUSINESS
4447-14912-0025 BUT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT FEWER PEOPLE KEEP THEM NOW THAN WAS THE CASE A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO OWING TO THE ADVANCE OF QUICK SHOOTING OTHERWISE DRIVING
4447-14912-0026 AND IT WOULD BE A SIN INDEED IN THE CALENDAR OF BRITISH SPORTS IF THE FINE OLD BREED OF POINTER WERE ALLOWED EVEN TO DETERIORATE THE APPARENT DANGER IS THAT THE PERSONAL OR INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT IS DYING OUT IN THE SEVENTIES THE NAME OF DRAKE
4447-14912-0027 BANG OR GARNET WERE LIKE HOUSEHOLD WORDS PEOPLE TALKED OF THE GREAT POINTERS THEY WERE SPOKEN OF IN CLUB CHAT OR GOSSIP WRITTEN ABOUT AND THE PROSPECTS OF THE MOORS WERE MUCH ASSOCIATED WITH THE UP TO DATE CHARACTERS OF THE POINTERS AND SETTERS
4447-14912-0028 THERE IS VERY LITTLE OF THIS SORT OF TALK NOW A DAYS GUNS ARE MORE CRITICALLY SPOKEN OF THERE IS HOWEVER A WIDE ENOUGH WORLD TO SUPPLY WITH FIRST CLASS POINTERS IN ENGLAND'S NUMEROUS COLONIES IT MAY BE MUCH MORE FITTING TO SHOOT OVER DOGS
4447-14912-0029 IT HAS BEEN TRIED IN SOUTH AFRICA WITH MARVELLOUS RESULTS DESCENDANTS OF BANG HAVE DELIGHTED THE LONE COLONIST ON CAPE PARTRIDGE AND QUAILS AND POINTERS SUIT THE CLIMATE WHEREAS SETTERS DO NOT THE POINTER IS A NOBLE BREED TO TAKE UP
4447-14912-0030 AS THOSE STILL IN MIDDLE LIFE HAVE SEEN ITS EXTRAORDINARY MERIT WHENEVER BRED IN THE RIGHT WAY AS TO THE ESSENTIAL POINTS OF THE BREED THEY MAY BE SET DOWN AS FOLLOWS HEAD SHOULD BE WIDE FROM EAR TO EAR
4447-14912-0031 CHEEK BONES PROMINENT EARS SET LOW AND THIN IN TEXTURE SOFT AND VELVETY NOSE BROAD AT THE BASE MOUTH LARGE AND JAWS LEVEL NECK
4447-14912-0032 THE NECK SHOULD BE VERY STRONG BUT LONG AND SLIGHTLY ARCHED MEETING SHOULDERS WELL KNIT INTO THE BACK WHICH SHOULD BE STRAIGHT AND JOINING A WIDE LOIN THERE SHOULD BE GREAT DEPTH OF HEART ROOM VERY DEEP BRISKET NARROW CHEST RATHER THAN OTHERWISE
4447-14912-0033 SHOULDERS LONG AND SLANTING LEGS AND FEET
4447-14912-0034 THERE SHOULD BE REALLY NO DIFFERENCE AS THEY MUST BE STRAIGHT THE KNEES BIG AND THE BONE SHOULD BE OF GOODLY SIZE DOWN TO THE TOES AND THE FEET SHOULD BE VERY ROUND AND CAT SHAPED HIND QUARTERS
4447-14912-0035 A GREAT FEATURE IN THE POINTER IS HIS HIND QUARTERS HE CANNOT WELL BE TOO LONG IN THE HAUNCH OR STRONG IN THE STIFLE WHICH SHOULD BE WELL BENT AND THE MUSCLES IN THE SECOND THIGH OF A GOOD POINTER ARE ALWAYS REMARKABLE
4447-14912-0036 THE HOCKS MAY BE STRAIGHTER THAN EVEN IN A FOXHOUND AS IN PULLING UP SHARP ON HIS POINT HE IN A GREAT MEASURE THROWS HIS WEIGHT ON THEM THE SHANK BONES BELOW THE HOCK SHOULD BE SHORT COLOUR
4447-14912-0037 THERE HAVE BEEN GOOD ONES OF ALL COLOURS THE DERBY COLOURS WERE ALWAYS LIVER AND WHITES FOR THEIR POINTERS AND BLACK BREASTED REDS FOR THEIR GAME COCKS THE SEFTONS WERE LIVER AND WHITES ALSO AND SO WERE THE EDGES OF STRELLY BUT MOSTLY HEAVILY TICKED
4447-14912-0038 MIKE AND YOUNG BANG DRAKE WAS MORE OF THE DERBY COLOUR DARK LIVER AND WHITE MISTER WHITEHOUSE'S WERE MOSTLY LEMON AND WHITES AFTER HAMLET OF THAT COLOUR
4447-14912-0039 MISTER FRANCIS'S AFTERWARDS MISTER SALTER'S CHANG WAS A FIELD TRIAL WINNER OF THIS COLOUR A STILL BETTER ONE WAS MISTER S BECKET'S RECTOR A SOMEWHAT MEAN LITTLE DOG TO LOOK AT
4447-14912-0040 BUT QUITE EXTRAORDINARY IN HIS WORK AS HE WON THE POINTER PUPPY STAKE AT SHREWSBURY AND THE ALL AGED STAKE THREE YEARS IN SUCCESSION MISTER SALTER'S ROMP FAMILY WERE QUITE REMARKABLE IN COLOUR
4447-14912-0041 A WHITE GROUND HEAVILY SHOT WITH BLACK IN PATCHES AND IN TICKS THERE HAVE NEVER BEEN ANY BETTER POINTERS THAN THESE THERE HAVE BEEN AND ARE GOOD BLACK POINTERS ALSO HEIGHT AND SIZE
4447-14912-0042 WERE OF THE FORMER HEIGHT AND THE GREAT BITCH MISTER LLOYD PRICE'S BELLE WAS TWENTY FOUR INCHES FOR BIG POINTERS SIXTY POUNDS IS ABOUT THE WEIGHT FOR DOGS AND FIFTY SIX POUNDS BITCHES SMALLER SIZE FIFTY FOUR POUNDS DOGS AND FORTY EIGHT POUNDS BITCHES
