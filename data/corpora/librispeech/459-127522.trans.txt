459-127522-0000 ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE OPEN STOOD ONE OF THE HILLS WITH TWO QUAINT CRAGGY PEAKS SHINING VIVIDLY IN THE SUN I NOW FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE JOY OF EXPLORATION THE ISLE WAS UNINHABITED
459-127522-0001 HERE AND THERE I SAW SNAKES AND ONE RAISED HIS HEAD FROM A LEDGE OF ROCK AND HISSED AT ME WITH A NOISE NOT UNLIKE THE SPINNING OF A TOP LITTLE DID I SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS A DEADLY ENEMY AND THAT THE NOISE WAS THE FAMOUS RATTLE
459-127522-0002 THE THICKET STRETCHED DOWN FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE SANDY KNOLLS SPREADING AND GROWING TALLER AS IT WENT UNTIL IT REACHED THE MARGIN OF THE BROAD REEDY FEN THROUGH WHICH THE NEAREST OF THE LITTLE RIVERS SOAKED ITS WAY INTO THE ANCHORAGE
459-127522-0003 ANOTHER FOLLOWED AND SOON OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE MARSH A GREAT CLOUD OF BIRDS HUNG SCREAMING AND CIRCLING IN THE AIR I JUDGED AT ONCE THAT SOME OF MY SHIPMATES MUST BE DRAWING NEAR ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE FEN NOR WAS I DECEIVED
459-127522-0004 FOR SOON I HEARD THE VERY DISTANT AND LOW TONES OF A HUMAN VOICE WHICH AS I CONTINUED TO GIVE EAR GREW STEADILY LOUDER AND NEARER THIS PUT ME IN A GREAT FEAR AND I CRAWLED UNDER COVER OF THE NEAREST LIVE OAK AND SQUATTED THERE
459-127522-0005 HEARKENING AS SILENT AS A MOUSE ANOTHER VOICE ANSWERED AND THEN THE FIRST VOICE WHICH I NOW RECOGNIZED TO BE SILVER'S ONCE MORE TOOK UP THE STORY AND RAN ON FOR A LONG WHILE IN A STREAM
459-127522-0006 ONLY NOW AND AGAIN INTERRUPTED BY THE OTHER BY THE SOUND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING EARNESTLY AND ALMOST FIERCELY BUT NO DISTINCT WORD CAME TO MY HEARING AT LAST THE SPEAKERS SEEMED TO HAVE PAUSED AND PERHAPS TO HAVE SAT DOWN
459-127522-0007 FOR NOT ONLY DID THEY CEASE TO DRAW ANY NEARER BUT THE BIRDS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GROW MORE QUIET AND TO SETTLE AGAIN TO THEIR PLACES IN THE SWAMP AND NOW I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT I WAS NEGLECTING MY BUSINESS
459-127522-0008 THAT SINCE I HAD BEEN SO FOOLHARDY AS TO COME ASHORE WITH THESE DESPERADOES THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS TO OVERHEAR THEM AT THEIR COUNCILS AND THAT MY PLAIN AND OBVIOUS DUTY WAS TO DRAW AS CLOSE AS I COULD MANAGE UNDER THE FAVOURABLE AMBUSH OF THE CROUCHING TREES
459-127522-0009 I MADE STEADILY BUT SLOWLY TOWARDS THEM TILL AT LAST RAISING MY HEAD TO AN APERTURE AMONG THE LEAVES I COULD SEE CLEAR DOWN INTO A LITTLE GREEN DELL BESIDE THE MARSH AND CLOSELY SET ABOUT WITH TREES WHERE LONG JOHN SILVER
459-127522-0010 AND ANOTHER OF THE CREW STOOD FACE TO FACE IN CONVERSATION THE SUN BEAT FULL UPON THEM SILVER HAD THROWN HIS HAT BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND AND HIS GREAT SMOOTH BLOND FACE
459-127522-0011 ALL SHINING WITH HEAT WAS LIFTED TO THE OTHER MAN'S IN A KIND OF APPEAL MATE HE WAS SAYING IT'S BECAUSE I THINKS GOLD DUST OF YOU GOLD DUST AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT IF I HADN'T TOOK TO YOU LIKE PITCH
459-127522-0012 ALL'S UP YOU CAN'T MAKE NOR MEND IT'S TO SAVE YOUR NECK THAT I'M A SPEAKING AND IF ONE OF THE WILD UNS KNEW IT WHERE'D I BE TOM NOW TELL ME WHERE'D I BE SILVER SAID THE OTHER MAN
459-127522-0013 AND YOU'VE MONEY TOO WHICH LOTS OF POOR SAILORS HASN'T AND YOU'RE BRAVE OR I'M MISTOOK
459-127522-0014 NOT YOU AS SURE AS GOD SEES ME I'D SOONER LOSE MY HAND IF I TURN AGIN MY DOOTY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A NOISE I HAD FOUND ONE OF THE HONEST HANDS WELL
459-127522-0015 HERE AT THAT SAME MOMENT CAME NEWS OF ANOTHER FAR AWAY OUT IN THE MARSH THERE AROSE ALL OF A SUDDEN A SOUND LIKE THE CRY OF ANGER THEN ANOTHER ON THE BACK OF IT AND THEN ONE HORRID LONG DRAWN SCREAM
459-127522-0016 THE ROCKS OF THE SPY GLASS RE ECHOED IT A SCORE OF TIMES THE WHOLE TROOP OF MARSH BIRDS ROSE AGAIN DARKENING HEAVEN WITH A SIMULTANEOUS WHIRR AND LONG AFTER THAT DEATH YELL WAS STILL RINGING IN MY BRAIN
459-127522-0017 SILENCE HAD RE ESTABLISHED ITS EMPIRE AND ONLY THE RUSTLE OF THE REDESCENDING BIRDS AND THE BOOM OF THE DISTANT SURGES DISTURBED THE LANGUOR OF THE AFTERNOON TOM HAD LEAPED AT THE SOUND LIKE A HORSE AT THE SPUR
459-127522-0018 LEAPING BACK A YARD AS IT SEEMED TO ME WITH THE SPEED AND SECURITY OF A TRAINED GYMNAST HANDS OFF IF YOU LIKE JOHN SILVER SAID THE OTHER IT'S A BLACK CONSCIENCE THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEARED OF ME BUT IN HEAVEN'S NAME TELL ME WHAT WAS THAT
459-127522-0019 HIS EYE A MERE PIN POINT IN HIS BIG FACE BUT GLEAMING LIKE A CRUMB OF GLASS THAT
459-127522-0020 AND AT THIS POINT TOM FLASHED OUT LIKE A HERO ALAN HE CRIED THEN REST HIS SOUL FOR A TRUE SEAMAN AND AS FOR YOU JOHN SILVER LONG YOU'VE BEEN A MATE OF MINE BUT YOU'RE MATE OF MINE NO MORE
459-127522-0021 IF I DIE LIKE A DOG I'LL DIE IN MY DOOTY YOU'VE KILLED ALAN HAVE YOU KILL ME TOO IF YOU CAN BUT I DEFIES YOU AND WITH THAT THIS BRAVE FELLOW TURNED HIS BACK DIRECTLY ON THE COOK AND SET OFF WALKING FOR THE BEACH
459-127522-0022 BUT HE WAS NOT DESTINED TO GO FAR WITH A CRY JOHN SEIZED THE BRANCH OF A TREE WHIPPED THE CRUTCH OUT OF HIS ARMPIT AND SENT THAT UNCOUTH MISSILE HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR IT STRUCK POOR TOM POINT FOREMOST
459-127522-0023 AND WITH STUNNING VIOLENCE RIGHT BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK HIS HANDS FLEW UP HE GAVE A SORT OF GASP AND FELL WHETHER HE WERE INJURED MUCH OR LITTLE NONE COULD EVER TELL
459-127522-0024 LIKE ENOUGH TO JUDGE FROM THE SOUND HIS BACK WAS BROKEN ON THE SPOT BUT HE HAD NO TIME GIVEN HIM TO RECOVER SILVER AGILE AS A MONKEY EVEN WITHOUT LEG OR CRUTCH WAS ON THE TOP OF HIM NEXT MOMENT
459-127522-0025 BUT I DO KNOW THAT FOR THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE THE WHOLE WORLD SWAM AWAY FROM BEFORE ME IN A WHIRLING MIST SILVER AND THE BIRDS AND THE TALL SPY GLASS HILLTOP GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND TOPSY TURVY BEFORE MY EYES
459-127522-0026 JUST BEFORE HIM TOM LAY MOTIONLESS UPON THE SWARD BUT THE MURDERER MINDED HIM NOT A WHIT CLEANSING HIS BLOOD STAINED KNIFE THE WHILE UPON A WISP OF GRASS EVERYTHING ELSE WAS UNCHANGED
459-127522-0027 THE SUN STILL SHINING MERCILESSLY ON THE STEAMING MARSH AND THE TALL PINNACLE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND I COULD SCARCE PERSUADE MYSELF THAT MURDER HAD BEEN ACTUALLY DONE AND A HUMAN LIFE CRUELLY CUT SHORT A MOMENT SINCE BEFORE MY EYES
459-127522-0028 BUT NOW JOHN PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET BROUGHT OUT A WHISTLE AND BLEW UPON IT SEVERAL MODULATED BLASTS THAT RANG FAR ACROSS THE HEATED AIR I COULD NOT TELL OF COURSE THE MEANING OF THE SIGNAL
459-127522-0029 I COULD HEAR HAILS COMING AND GOING BETWEEN THE OLD BUCCANEER AND HIS COMRADES AND THIS SOUND OF DANGER LENT ME WINGS AS SOON AS I WAS CLEAR OF THE THICKET I RAN AS I NEVER RAN BEFORE SCARCE MINDING THE DIRECTION OF MY FLIGHT
459-127522-0030 SO LONG AS IT LED ME FROM THE MURDERERS AND AS I RAN FEAR GREW AND GREW UPON ME UNTIL IT TURNED INTO A KIND OF FRENZY INDEED COULD ANYONE BE MORE ENTIRELY LOST THAN I
459-127522-0031 WHEN THE GUN FIRED HOW SHOULD I DARE TO GO DOWN TO THE BOATS AMONG THOSE FIENDS STILL SMOKING FROM THEIR CRIME WOULD NOT THE FIRST OF THEM WHO SAW ME WRING MY NECK LIKE A SNIPE'S
459-127522-0032 WOULD NOT MY ABSENCE ITSELF BE AN EVIDENCE TO THEM OF MY ALARM AND THEREFORE OF MY FATAL KNOWLEDGE IT WAS ALL OVER I THOUGHT
459-127522-0033 GOOD BYE TO THE SQUIRE THE DOCTOR AND THE CAPTAIN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME BUT DEATH BY STARVATION OR DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS ALL THIS WHILE AS I SAY I WAS STILL RUNNING
459-127522-0034 AND WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE I HAD DRAWN NEAR TO THE FOOT OF THE LITTLE HILL WITH THE TWO PEAKS AND HAD GOT INTO A PART OF THE ISLAND WHERE THE LIVE OAKS GREW MORE WIDELY APART AND SEEMED MORE LIKE FOREST TREES IN THEIR BEARING AND DIMENSIONS
459-127522-0035 MINGLED WITH THESE WERE A FEW SCATTERED PINES SOME FIFTY SOME NEARER SEVENTY FEET HIGH THE AIR TOO SMELT MORE FRESHLY THAN DOWN BESIDE THE MARSH
