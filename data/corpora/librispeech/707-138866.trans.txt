707-138866-0000 OR RATHER HE BEGAN TO THINK OF ALICE'S BEHAVIOUR THEN AND OF ALICE'S WORDS ALICE HAD STEADFASTLY REFUSED TO GIVE ANY AID NO LESS LIKELY ASSISTANT FOR SUCH A PURPOSE COULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED
707-138866-0001 BUT SHE HAD BEEN VERY EARNEST IN DECLARING THAT IT WAS GLENCORA'S DUTY TO STAND BY HER PROMISE TO BURGO HE IS A DESPERATE SPENDTHRIFT KATE VAVASOR HAD SAID TO HER THEN LET HER TEACH HIM TO BE OTHERWISE ALICE HAD ANSWERED
707-138866-0002 THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD REASON FOR REFUSING HIS OFFER WHEN HE FIRST MADE IT BUT IT CAN BE NO EXCUSE FOR UNTRUTH NOW THAT SHE HAS TOLD HIM THAT SHE LOVES HIM IF A WOMAN SHE HAD SAID AGAIN WON'T VENTURE HER FORTUNE FOR THE MAN SHE LOVES HER LOVE IS NOT WORTH HAVING
707-138866-0003 ALL THIS GEORGE VAVASOR REMEMBERED NOW AND AS HE REMEMBERED IT HE ASKED HIMSELF WHETHER THE WOMAN THAT HAD ONCE LOVED HIM WOULD VENTURE HER FORTUNE FOR HIM STILL THOUGH HIS SISTER HAD PRESSED HIM ON THE SUBJECT WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT SHE COULD USE
707-138866-0004 HE HAD HARDLY HITHERTO MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE REALLY DESIRED TO MARRY ALICE THERE HAD GROWN UPON HIM LATELY CERTAIN BOHEMIAN PROPENSITIES A LOVE OF ABSOLUTE INDEPENDENCE IN HIS THOUGHTS AS WELL AS ACTIONS WHICH WERE ANTAGONISTIC TO MARRIAGE
707-138866-0005 AS MANY MEN BOTH IN HEATHEN AND IN CHRISTIAN AGES HAVE TAUGHT THEMSELVES TO THINK OF RELIGION BUT WHICH WAS NOT ADAPTED TO HIS ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE IF HE LOVED ANY WOMAN HE LOVED HIS COUSIN ALICE IF HE THOROUGHLY RESPECTED ANY WOMAN HE RESPECTED HER
707-138866-0006 BUT THAT IDEA OF TYING HIMSELF DOWN TO A HOUSEHOLD WAS IN ITSELF DISTASTEFUL TO HIM IT IS A THING TERRIBLE TO THINK OF HE ONCE SAID TO A CONGENIAL FRIEND IN THESE DAYS OF HIS LIFE
707-138866-0007 THAT A MAN SHOULD GIVE PERMISSION TO A PRIEST TO TIE HIM TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING LIKE A SIAMESE TWIN SO THAT ALL POWER OF SEPARATE AND SOLITARY ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM HIM FOR EVER THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD DO NOT TREAT EACH OTHER SO BADLY THEY NEITHER DRINK THEMSELVES DRUNK NOR EAT THEMSELVES STUPID
707-138866-0008 HAD TAUGHT HIMSELF SOME THEORIES OF A PECULIAR NATURE BUT NEVERTHELESS AS HE THOUGHT OF ALICE VAVASOR ON THIS OCCASION HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT IF A SIAMESE TWIN WERE NECESSARY FOR HIM SHE OF ALL OTHERS WAS THE WOMAN TO WHOM HE WOULD WISH TO BE SO BOUND
707-138866-0009 AND IF HE DID IT AT ALL HE MUST DO IT NOW UNDER THE JOINT INSTIGATION OF HIMSELF AND HIS SISTER AS HE THOUGHT AND PERHAPS NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT REASON SHE HAD BROKEN HER ENGAGEMENT WITH MISTER GREY THAT SHE WOULD RENEW IT AGAIN IF LEFT TO HERSELF HE BELIEVED PROBABLE
707-138866-0010 AND THEN DESPITE THAT ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAD TAUGHT HIM TO REGARD ALL FORMS AND CEREMONIES WITH THE EYE OF A PHILOSOPHER HE HAD STILL ENOUGH OF HUMAN FRAILTY ABOUT HIM TO FEEL KEENLY ALIVE TO THE PLEASURE OF TAKING FROM JOHN GREY THE PRIZE WHICH JOHN GREY
707-138866-0011 HAD SO NEARLY TAKEN FROM HIM IF ALICE COULD HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO THINK AS HE DID AS TO THE ABSURDITY OF THOSE INDISSOLUBLE TIES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT NOTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE IMPOSSIBLE THAN THE TEACHING OF SUCH A LESSON TO HIS COUSIN ALICE
707-138866-0012 GEORGE VAVASOR WAS A MAN OF COURAGE AND DARED DO MOST THINGS BUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO COMMENCE THE TEACHING OF SUCH A LESSON TO HER AND NOW AT THIS MOMENT WHAT WAS HIS OUTLOOK INTO LIFE GENERALLY
707-138866-0013 HE HAD VERY HIGH AMBITION AND A FAIR HOPE OF GRATIFYING IT IF HE COULD ONLY PROVIDE THAT THINGS SHOULD GO WELL WITH HIM FOR A YEAR OR SO HE WAS STILL A POOR MAN HAVING BEEN ONCE NEARLY A RICH MAN BUT STILL SO MUCH OF THE RESULT OF HIS NEARLY ACQUIRED RICHES
707-138866-0014 REMAINED TO HIM THAT ON THE STRENGTH OF THEM HE MIGHT PROBABLY FIND HIS WAY INTO PARLIAMENT HE HAD PAID THE COST OF THE LAST ATTEMPT AND MIGHT IN A GREAT DEGREE CARRY ON THIS PRESENT ATTEMPT ON CREDIT
707-138866-0015 IF HE SUCCEEDED THERE WOULD BE OPEN TO HIM A MODE OF LIFE AGREEABLE IN ITSELF AND HONOURABLE AMONG MEN BUT HOW WAS HE TO BEAR THE COST OF THIS FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR THE NEXT TWO YEARS HIS GRANDFATHER WAS STILL ALIVE AND WOULD PROBABLY LIVE OVER THAT PERIOD
707-138866-0016 IF HE MARRIED ALICE HE WOULD DO SO WITH NO IDEA OF CHEATING HER OUT OF HER MONEY SHE SHOULD LEARN NAY SHE HAD ALREADY LEARNED FROM HIS OWN LIPS HOW PERILOUS WAS HIS ENTERPRISE BUT HE KNEW HER TO BE A WOMAN WHO WOULD BOLDLY RISK ALL IN MONEY
707-138866-0017 THOUGH NO CONSIDERATION WOULD INDUCE HER TO STIR A HAIR'S BREADTH TOWARDS DANGER IN REPUTATION TOWARDS TEACHING HER THAT DOCTRINE AT WHICH I HAVE HINTED HE WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT
707-138866-0018 BUT HE FELT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NO REPUGNANCE TO TELLING HER THAT HE WANTED TO SPEND ALL HER MONEY IN THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE HE WAS STILL IN HIS ARM CHAIR THINKING OF ALL THIS WITH THAT SMALL UNTASTED MODICUM OF BRANDY AND WATER BESIDE HIM
707-138866-0019 WHEN HE HEARD SOME DISTANT LAMBETH CLOCK STRIKE THREE FROM OVER THE RIVER THEN HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND TAKING THE CANDLES IN HIS HAND SAT HIMSELF DOWN AT A WRITING DESK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM I NEEDN'T SEND IT WHEN IT'S WRITTEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT I WON'T
707-138866-0020 THEN HE TOOK HIS PAPER AND WROTE AS FOLLOWS DEAR ALICE THE TIME WAS WHEN THE PRIVILEGE WAS MINE OF BEGINNING MY LETTERS TO YOU WITH A WARMER SHOW OF LOVE THAN THE ABOVE WORD CONTAINS WHEN I MIGHT AND DID CALL YOU DEAREST
707-138866-0021 BUT I LOST THAT PRIVILEGE THROUGH MY OWN FOLLY AND SINCE THAT IT HAS BEEN ACCORDED TO ANOTHER BUT YOU HAVE FOUND WITH A THOROUGH HONESTY OF PURPOSE THAN WHICH I KNOW NOTHING GREATER THAT IT HAS BEHOVED YOU TO WITHDRAW THAT PRIVILEGE ALSO
707-138866-0022 I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN AS I NOW WRITE HAD YOU NOT FOUND IT EXPEDIENT TO DO AS YOU HAVE DONE I NOW ONCE AGAIN ASK YOU TO BE MY WIFE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT PASSED IN THOSE OLD DAYS
707-138866-0023 OF ALL THE SELFISH FOLLY OF WHICH I WAS THEN GUILTY I THINK YOU KNOW AND AT THE TIME KNEW THAT I EVER LOVED YOU I CLAIM TO SAY FOR MYSELF THAT MY LOVE TO YOU WAS TRUE FROM FIRST TO LAST AND I CLAIM FROM YOU BELIEF FOR THAT STATEMENT
707-138866-0024 INDEED I DO NOT THINK THAT YOU EVER DOUBTED MY LOVE NEVERTHELESS WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT I MIGHT NO LONGER HOPE TO MAKE YOU MY WIFE I HAD NO WORD OF REMONSTRANCE THAT I COULD UTTER YOU ACTED AS ANY WOMAN WOULD ACT WHOM LOVE HAD NOT MADE A FOOL
707-138866-0025 THEN CAME THE EPISODE OF MISTER GREY AND BITTER AS HAVE BEEN MY FEELINGS WHILST THAT ENGAGEMENT LASTED I NEVER MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO COME BETWEEN YOU AND THE LIFE YOU HAD CHOSEN IN SAYING THIS I DO NOT FORGET THE WORDS WHICH I SPOKE LAST SUMMER AT BASLE WHEN AS FAR AS I KNEW
707-138866-0026 YOU STILL INTENDED THAT HE SHOULD BE YOUR HUSBAND BUT WHAT I SAID THEN WAS NOTHING TO THAT WHICH WITH MUCH VIOLENCE I REFRAINED FROM SAYING WHETHER YOU REMEMBER THOSE FEW WORDS I CANNOT TELL BUT CERTAINLY YOU WOULD NOT HAVE REMEMBERED THEM
707-138866-0027 WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE NOTICED THEM HAD YOUR HEART BEEN AT NETHERCOATS BUT ALL THIS IS NOTHING YOU ARE NOW AGAIN A FREE WOMAN AND ONCE AGAIN I ASK YOU TO BE MY WIFE WE ARE BOTH OLDER THAN WE WERE WHEN WE LOVED BEFORE AND WILL BOTH BE PRONE TO THINK OF MARRIAGE IN A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT LIGHT
707-138866-0028 THEN PERSONAL LOVE FOR EACH OTHER WAS MOST IN OUR THOUGHTS GOD FORBID THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE MUCH IN OUR THOUGHTS NOW PERHAPS I AM DECEIVING MYSELF IN SAYING THAT IT IS NOT EVEN NOW STRONGER IN MINE THAN ANY OTHER CONSIDERATION BUT WE HAVE BOTH REACHED THAT TIME OF LIFE
707-138866-0029 THAT IN ANY PROPOSITION OF MARRIAGE WE SHOULD THINK MORE OF OUR ADAPTABILITY TO EACH OTHER THAN WE DID BEFORE FOR MYSELF I KNOW THAT THERE IS MUCH IN MY CHARACTER AND DISPOSITION TO MAKE ME UNFIT TO MARRY A WOMAN OF THE COMMON STAMP YOU KNOW MY MODE OF LIFE
707-138866-0030 AND WHAT ARE MY HOPES AND MY CHANCES OF SUCCESS I RUN GREAT RISK OF FAILING IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL ENCOUNTER RUIN WHERE I LOOK FOR REPUTATION AND A CAREER OF HONOUR
707-138866-0031 BUT WHATEVER MAY BE THE CHANCES I SHALL GO ON AS LONG AS ANY MEANS OF CARRYING ON THE FIGHT ARE AT MY DISPOSAL IF YOU WERE MY WIFE TO MORROW I SHOULD EXPECT TO USE YOUR MONEY IF IT WERE NEEDED IN STRUGGLING TO OBTAIN A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT AND A HEARING THERE
707-138866-0032 I WILL HARDLY STOOP TO TELL YOU THAT I DO NOT ASK YOU TO BE MY WIFE FOR THE SAKE OF THIS AID BUT IF YOU WERE TO BECOME MY WIFE I SHOULD EXPECT ALL YOUR COOPERATION WITH YOUR MONEY POSSIBLY BUT CERTAINLY WITH YOUR WARMEST SPIRIT AND NOW ONCE AGAIN ALICE DEAREST ALICE
707-138866-0033 WILL YOU BE MY WIFE I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED
707-138866-0034 YOU CANNOT ACCUSE MY LOVE SINCE THE TIME IN WHICH I MIGHT SIT WITH MY ARM ROUND YOUR WAIST I HAVE SAT WITH IT ROUND NO OTHER WAIST SINCE YOUR LIPS WERE MINE NO OTHER LIPS HAVE BEEN DEAR TO ME SINCE YOU WERE MY COUNSELLOR I HAVE HAD NO OTHER COUNSELLOR
707-138866-0035 UNLESS IT BE POOR KATE WHOSE WISH THAT WE MAY AT LENGTH BE MARRIED IS SECOND IN EARNESTNESS ONLY TO MY OWN NOR DO I THINK YOU WILL DOUBT MY REPENTANCE SUCH REPENTANCE INDEED CLAIMS NO MERIT
707-138866-0036 PROVIDENCE HAS HITHERTO BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME IN NOT HAVING MADE THAT LOSS IRREMEDIABLE BY YOUR MARRIAGE WITH MISTER GREY I WISH YOU NOW TO CONSIDER THE MATTER WELL AND TO TELL ME WHETHER YOU CAN PARDON ME AND STILL LOVE ME
707-138866-0037 DO I FLATTER MYSELF WHEN I FEEL THAT I DOUBT YOUR PARDON ALMOST MORE THAN I DOUBT YOUR LOVE THINK OF THIS THING IN ALL ITS BEARINGS BEFORE YOU ANSWER ME I AM SO ANXIOUS THAT YOU SHOULD THINK OF IT THAT I WILL NOT EXPECT YOUR REPLY TILL THIS DAY WEEK
707-138866-0038 IT CAN HARDLY BE YOUR DESIRE TO GO THROUGH LIFE UNMARRIED I SHOULD SAY THAT IT MUST BE ESSENTIAL TO YOUR AMBITION THAT YOU SHOULD JOIN YOUR LOT TO THAT OF SOME MAN THE NATURE OF WHOSE ASPIRATIONS
707-138866-0039 IT IS BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT SO AS REGARDED HIM WHOSE SUIT YOU HAD ACCEPTED THAT YOU FOUND YOURSELF AT LAST OBLIGED TO PART FROM HIM MAY I NOT SAY THAT WITH US THERE WOULD BE NO SUCH DIFFERENCE IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IN THIS RESPECT WE ARE FITTED FOR EACH OTHER
707-138866-0040 AS MAN AND WOMAN SELDOM ARE FITTED THAT I ONCE AGAIN ASK YOU TO BE MY WIFE THIS WILL REACH YOU AT VAVASOR WHERE YOU WILL NOW BE WITH THE OLD SQUIRE AND KATE I HAVE TOLD HER NOTHING OF MY PURPOSE IN WRITING THIS LETTER
707-138866-0041 IF IT SHOULD BE THAT YOUR ANSWER IS SUCH AS I DESIRE I SHOULD USE THE OPPORTUNITY OF OUR RE ENGAGEMENT TO ENDEAVOUR TO BE RECONCILED TO MY GRANDFATHER HE HAS MISUNDERSTOOD ME AND HAS ILL USED ME BUT I AM READY TO FORGIVE THAT IF HE WILL ALLOW ME TO DO SO
707-138866-0042 IN SUCH CASE YOU AND KATE WOULD ARRANGE THAT AND I WOULD IF POSSIBLE GO DOWN TO VAVASOR WHILE YOU ARE THERE BUT I AM GALLOPING ON A HEAD FOOLISHLY IN THINKING OF THIS AND AM COUNTING UP MY WEALTH WHILE THE CROCKERY IN MY BASKET IS SO VERY FRAGILE
707-138866-0043 ONE WORD FROM YOU WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NO I SHALL EVER BRING IT INTO MARKET IF THAT WORD IS TO BE ADVERSE DO NOT SAY ANYTHING OF A MEETING BETWEEN ME AND THE SQUIRE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT OH ALICE DO NOT LET IT BE ADVERSE
707-138866-0044 I THINK YOU LOVE ME YOUR WOMAN'S PRIDE TOWARDS ME HAS BEEN GREAT AND GOOD AND WOMANLY BUT IT HAS HAD ITS WAY AND IF YOU LOVE ME MIGHT NOW BE TAUGHT TO SUCCUMB DEAR ALICE WILL YOU BE MY WIFE
707-138866-0045 YOURS IN ANY EVENT MOST AFFECTIONATELY GEORGE VAVASOR VAVASOR WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS LETTER WENT BACK TO HIS SEAT OVER THE FIRE AND THERE HE SAT WITH IT CLOSE AT HIS HAND FOR NEARLY AN HOUR ONCE OR TWICE HE TOOK IT UP WITH FINGERS ALMOST ITCHING TO THROW IT INTO THE FIRE
707-138866-0046 HE TOOK IT UP AND HELD THE CORNERS BETWEEN HIS FOREFINGER AND THUMB THROWING FORWARD HIS HAND TOWARDS THE FLAME AS THOUGH WILLING THAT THE LETTER SHOULD ESCAPE FROM HIM AND PERISH IF CHANCE SHOULD SO DECIDE BUT CHANCE DID NOT SO DECIDE AND THE LETTER WAS PUT BACK UPON THE TABLE AT HIS ELBOW
707-138866-0047 THEN WHEN THE HOUR WAS NEARLY OVER HE READ IT AGAIN I'LL BET TWO TO ONE THAT SHE GIVES WAY HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE PUT THE SHEET OF PAPER BACK INTO THE ENVELOPE WOMEN ARE SUCH OUT AND OUT FOOLS THEN HE TOOK HIS CANDLE AND CARRYING HIS LETTER WITH HIM WENT INTO HIS BEDROOM
707-138866-0048 THE NEXT MORNING WAS THE MORNING OF CHRISTMAS EVE AT ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK A BOY CAME INTO HIS ROOM WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CALL FOR ORDERS FOR THE DAY JEM HE SAID TO THE BOY THERE'S HALF A CROWN LYING THERE ON THE LOOKING GLASS JEM LOOKED AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE PRESENCE OF THE HALF CROWN
707-138866-0049 ASKED THE BOY'S MASTER JEM SCRUTINIZED THE COIN AND DECLARED THAT THE UPPERMOST SURFACE SHOWED A TAIL THEN TAKE THAT LETTER AND POST IT SAID GEORGE VAVASOR WHEREUPON JEM ASKING NO QUESTION AND THINKING BUT LITTLE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE COMMAND WAS GIVEN
707-138866-0050 DID TAKE THE LETTER AND DID POST IT IN DUE ACCORDANCE WITH POSTAL REGULATIONS
707-138866-0051 ON THE CHRISTMAS MORNING A MERRY CHRISTMAS DID NOT FALL TO THE LOT OF GEORGE VAVASOR ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AN EARLY CHRISTMAS BOX HE DID RECEIVE IN THE SHAPE OF A VERY HURRIED NOTE FROM HIS FRIEND BURGO THIS WILL BE BROUGHT TO YOU BY STICKLING THE NOTE SAID
707-138866-0052 BUT WHO STICKLING WAS VAVASOR DID NOT KNOW I SEND THE BILL COULDN'T YOU GET THE MONEY AND SEND IT ME AS I DON'T WANT TO GO UP TO TOWN AGAIN BEFORE THE THING COMES OFF YOU'RE A TRUMP AND WILL DO THE BEST YOU CAN DON'T LET THAT ROGUE OFF FOR LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY
707-138866-0053 YOURS B F VAVASOR THEREFORE HAVING NOTHING BETTER TO DO SPENT HIS CHRISTMAS MORNING IN CALLING ON MISTER MAGRUIN
707-138866-0054 REALLY THIS IS NO MORNING FOR BUSINESS TIME AND TIDE WAIT FOR NO MAN MISTER MAGRUIN AND MY FRIEND WANTS HIS MONEY TO MORROW OH MISTER VAVASOR TO MORROW YES TO MORROW IF TIME AND TIDE WON'T WAIT NEITHER WILL LOVE

707-138866-0056 LADIES NEVER ARE SURE SAID VAVASOR HARDLY MORE SURE THAN BILLS MADE OVER TO MONEY LENDERS

707-138866-0058 AND CARRIED IT OFF IN TRIUMPH DO TELL HIM TO BE PUNCTUAL SAID MISTER MAGRUIN WHEN VAVASOR TOOK HIS LEAVE I DO SO LIKE YOUNG MEN TO BE PUNCTUAL BUT I REALLY THINK MISTER FITZGERALD IS THE MOST UNPUNCTUAL YOUNG MAN I EVER DID KNOW YET
707-138866-0059 I THINK HE IS SAID GEORGE VAVASOR AS HE WENT AWAY HE ATE HIS CHRISTMAS DINNER IN ABSOLUTE SOLITUDE AT AN EATING HOUSE NEAR HIS LODGINGS
707-138866-0060 HE AT ANY RATE DID NOT SO DARE AND AFTER DINNER HE WANDERED ABOUT THROUGH THE STREETS WONDERING WITHIN HIS MIND HOW HE WOULD ENDURE THE RESTRAINTS OF MARRIED LIFE
707-138866-0061 DURING WHICH HE WAITED NOT IMPATIENTLY FOR AN ANSWER TO HIS LETTER AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK
