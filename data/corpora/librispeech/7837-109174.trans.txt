7837-109174-0000 GRIM WAS A YEAR OLD WHEN HER SCALES BEGAN TO GROW IN HER EARLY YOUTH WHEN SHE COULD ONLY EAT SMALL CREATURES SHE HAD LIVED EXCLUSIVELY UPON WATER INSECTS AND LARVAE
7837-109174-0001 BUT FROM NOW ONWARDS SHE HAD NO RESPECT FOR ANY FLESH BUT THAT WHICH CLOTHED HER OWN RIBS SHE ATTACKED ANY FISH THAT WAS NOT BIG ENOUGH TO SWALLOW HER AND DEVOURED BLEAK AND SMALL ROACH WITH PECULIAR SATISFACTION
7837-109174-0002 NOW SHE TOOK HER REVENGE ON THE VORACIOUS SMALL FRY THAT HAD OFFENDED HER WHEN SHE WAS STILL IN AN EMBRYO STATE SHE HAD NOT BEEN HATCHED ARTIFICIALLY OR COME INTO THE WORLD IN A WOODEN BOX WITH RUNNING WATER PASSING THROUGH IT
7837-109174-0003 NO THE WHOLE THING HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER IN THE FLICKERING SUNSHINE OF A MARCH DAY HER MOTHER SURROUNDED BY THREE EQUALLY ARDENT WOOERS
7837-109174-0004 HAD SPAWNED AND THE EGGS HAD DROPPED AND ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO SOME TUFTS OF GRASS AT THE EDGE OF THE LAKE THE VERY NEXT DAY HOWEVER LITTLE FISH HAD BEGUN TO GATHER ABOUT THOSE TUFTS ONE DAY MORE AND THERE WERE SWARMS OF THEM
7837-109174-0005 EAGERLY THEY SEARCHED THE TUFTS AND DEVOURED ALL THE EGGS THEY COULD FIND AND SO THOROUGHLY DID THEY GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS THAT OF THE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF THE MOTHER'S EGGS ONLY TWO THAT HAD FALLEN INTO THE HEART OF A GRASS STALK WERE LEFT
7837-109174-0006 OUT OF ONE OF THESE GRIM HAD COME THE SUN HAD LOOKED AFTER HER HATCHED HER OUT AND TAUGHT HER TO SEIZE WHATEVER CAME IN HER WAY NOW SHE WAS AVENGING THE INJURIES TO HER TRIBE
7837-109174-0007 SHE POSSESSED A REMARKABLE POWER OF PLACING HERSELF AND KNEW HOW TO CHOOSE HER POSITION SO AS TO DISAPPEAR AS IT WERE IN THE WATER THE STALKS OF THE REEDS THREW THEIR SHADOWS ACROSS HER BODY IN ALL DIRECTIONS
7837-109174-0008 WATER GRASS AND DRIFTING DUCK WEED VEILED HER THE SILLY ROACH AND OTHER RESTLESS LITTLE FISH FLITTED ABOUT HER SOMETIMES SO CLOSE TO HER MOUTH THAT SHE COULD FEEL THE WAVES MADE BY THEIR TAIL FINS SOME WOULD ALMOST RUN RIGHT INTO HER
7837-109174-0009 BUT WHEN THEY SAW HER THEN HOW THE WATER FLASHED WITH STARRY GLEAMS AND HOW QUICKLY THEY ALL MADE OFF SHE LIKED BEST TO HIDE WHERE THE WATER LILIES FLOATED IN ISLANDS OF GREEN FOR THERE THE TREACHEROUS SHADOWS HER BEST FRIENDS
7837-109174-0010 FELL CLEARLY THROUGH THE WATER ABSORBED HER AS IT WERE AND MADE CAPTURE EASY FOR HER IF SHE FOUND HERSELF DISCOVERED SHE WOULD RETREAT WITH AS LITTLE HASTE AS POSSIBLE FOR THAT SORT OF THING AROUSED TOO MUCH ATTENTION
7837-109174-0011 AND CREATED WIDESPREAD DISTURBANCE IN THE FISHY WORLD IF SHE LAY ON THE SURFACE FOR INSTANCE AND SUSPECTED THAT SHE WAS BEING WATCHED FROM ABOVE SHE BECAME AS IT WERE MORE AND MORE INDISTINCT AND ONE WITH THE DARK WATER
7837-109174-0012 LETTING HERSELF SINK IMPERCEPTIBLY AT THE SAME TIME BEGINNING TO WORK ALL HER FINS IN AMPLE FOLDS THEY SOFTLY CREPT ROUND THE LONG STICK THAT HER BODY NOW RESEMBLED FRINGED AND VEILED IT AND BORE IT AWAY
7837-109174-0013 AND JUST AS SHE KNEW HOW TO PLACE HERSELF SO DID SHE KNOW HOW TO MOVE CAUTIOUSLY AND DISCREETLY FORMERLY SHE HAD MEASURED ONLY A FINGER'S LENGTH AND NOW SHE WAS ALREADY ABOUT A FOOT LONG
7837-109174-0014 HER VORACIOUSNESS HAD INCREASED IN A CORRESPONDING DEGREE SHE COULD EAT EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY SHE WOULD FILL HERSELF RIGHT UP TO THE NECK AND EVEN HAVE HALF A FISH STICKING OUT BEYOND
7837-109174-0015 IT WAS QUITE A COMMON SIGHT TO SEE A LITTLE FLAPPING FISH TAIL FOR WHICH HER DIGESTIVE ORGANS HAD NOT ROOM AS YET STICKING OUT OF HER MOUTH LIKE A LIVELY TONGUE SHE WOULD SWIM ABOUT DELIGHTEDLY SUCKING IT AS A BOY WOULD SUCK A STICK OF CANDY
7837-109174-0016 ONE DAY SHE WAS GLIDING SLOWLY THROUGH A CLUMP OF RUSHES AS LIFELESS AND DEAD AS ANY STICK HER EYES SEEMED TO BE ON STALKS AND SPIED EAGERLY ROUND BUT HER BODY EXHIBITED THE LEAST POSSIBLE MOVEMENT AND EAGERNESS
7837-109174-0017 SHE TURNED BUT EVEN THEN HOLDING HERSELF STIFF AND PLAYING HER NEW PART OF A DRIFTING STICK IN A MASTERLY MANNER AS SHE DID SO SHE DISCOVERED HER BROTHER AS PROMISING A SPECIMEN OF A YOUNG PIKE AS HERSELF
7837-109174-0018 WITH ALL THE DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF THE RACE ALTHOUGH COLD BLOODED SHE WAS OF A FIERY TEMPERAMENT AND AS SHE WAS ALSO HUNGRY SHE STARED GREEDILY AND WITH CANNIBAL FEELINGS AT THE APPARITION
7837-109174-0019 HER APPETITE GREW IN IMMEASURABLE UNITS OF TIME THE FOOD WAS AT HAND IT STARED HER IN THE FACE SHE FORGOT RELATIONSHIP AND RESEMBLANCE
7837-109174-0020 AND BENDING IN THE MIDDLE SO THAT HEAD AND TAIL MET SHE SEIZED HER BROTHER WITH A LIGHTNING MOVEMENT HE WAS QUITE AS BIG AS SHE STRUGGLED UNTIL HE WAS UNABLE TO MOVE A FIN BUT THE STROKE WAS SUCCESSFUL
7837-109174-0021 HER TEETH WERE DOUBLED AND AS THEY GREW THEY WERE SHARPENED BY THE CONTINUAL SUCTION OF THE WATER THROUGH THE GILLS IT WAS AS IF SHE UNDERSTOOD THEIR VALUE TOO
7837-109174-0022 FOR SHE WOULD OFTEN TAKE UP HER POSITION ON THE BOTTOM AND STIR UP GRAINS OF FINE HARD SAND THUS IMPROVING THE GRINDING PROCESS CONSIDERABLY IT WAS MOSTLY IN THE HALF LIGHT THAT SHE NOW WENT HUNTING
7837-109174-0023 IN THE EARLY DAWN OR AT DUSK HER SHARP EYES COULD SEE IN THE DARK LIKE THOSE OF THE OWL AND THE CAT WHEN THE SHADOWS LENGTHENED AND THE RED GLOW FROM THE SKY SPREAD OVER THE WATER
7837-109174-0024 SHE FELT HOW FAVOURABLE HER SURROUNDINGS WERE AND SHE BECAME ONE WITH THE POWER IN HER MIGHTY NATURE BUT IN THE DAYTIME SHE LAY PEACEFULLY DROWSING THE CREEK IN WHICH SHE LIVED HAD LOW LYING BANKS
7837-109174-0025 AMONG THE SHORT THICK GRASS ORCHIDS AND MARSH MARIGOLDS BLOOMED SIDE BY SIDE AND THE RAGGED ROBIN UNFOLDED ITS FRAYED DEEP PINK FLOWERS UPON A STIFF DARK BROWN STALK
7837-109174-0026 THAT ALWAYS HAD A MASS OF FROTHY WETNESS ABOUT ITS HEAD FARTHER OUT THE MUDDY WATER AND HORSETAILS BEGAN AND BEYOND THEM THE TALL WAVING REEDS
7837-109174-0027 WHICH STRETCHED AWAY IN GREAT CLUMPS AS FAR AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO REACH THE BOTTOM WHERE THEY LEFT OFF THE ROUND STALKED OLIVE GREEN BOG RUSHES BEGAN WADING FARTHER AND FARTHER OUT
7837-109174-0028 UNTIL IN MIDSTREAM THEY GATHERED IN LOW CLUMPS AND GROVES INHABITED BY AN ABUNDANT INSECT LIFE BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES DANCED THEIR BRIDAL DANCE OUT THERE
7837-109174-0029 SOME BRIGHT YELLOW WITH BLACK BORDERS OTHERS WITH THE SUNSET GLOW UPON THEIR WINGS DRAGON FLIES AND WATER NYMPHS BY THE SCORE REFRACTED THE SUN'S RAYS AS THEY TURNED WITH A FLASH OF ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
7837-109174-0030 BLACK WHIRLIGIGS LAY IN CLUSTERS AND SLEPT AND ON THE INDIA RUBBER LIKE LEAVES OF THE WATER LILY FLIES AND WASPS CRAWLED ABOUT DRY SHOP AND REFRESHED THEMSELVES WITH THE WATER
7837-109174-0031 IN THE STILL EARLY MORNING THE REEDS SIGH AND TREMBLE THE LITTLE YELLOWISH GREY SEDGE WARBLER COMES OUT SUDDENLY FROM ITS HIDING PLACE SEIZES THE LARGEST OF THE BUTTERFLIES BY THE BODY AND AS SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS AGAIN
7837-109174-0032 A LITTLE LATER IT BEGINS ITS SOFT LITTLE SAWING SONG WHICH BLENDS SO WELL WITH THE PERPETUAL MONOTONOUS WHISPERING OF THE REEDS GRIM DOWN AMONG THE VEGETATION ONLY FAINTLY CATCHES THE SUBDUED TONES
7837-109174-0033 SHE IS OCCUPIED WITH AN EVENT THAT IS DEVELOPING WITH GREAT RAPIDITY A MOTH HAS FALLEN SUDDENLY INTO THE CLEAR WATER IT TRIES TO RISE BUT CANNOT SO DARTS RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
7837-109174-0034 DRAGGING ITS TAWNY WINGS BEHIND IT IT PUTS FORTH ITS GREATEST SPEED MAKING IN A STRAIGHT LINE FOR THE SHORE BUT THE WHIRLIGIGS HAVE SEEN THE SHIPWRECK AND DART OUT ON THEIR WATER SKI TO TEAR THE THING TO PIECES
7837-109174-0035 THEY ADVANCE WITH THE SPEED OF A TORPEDO BOAT AND IN PECULIAR SPIRAL WINDINGS A WEDGE SHAPED FURROW STANDS OUT FROM THE BOW OF EACH LITTLE PIRATE AND A TINY CASCADE IN HIS WAKE
7837-109174-0036 THE POOR MOTH BECOMES WETTER AND WETTER AND LESS AND LESS OF HIS BODY REMAINS VISIBLE AS HE EXERTS HIMSELF TO REACH THE SAFETY OF THE REEDS WHERE HE CAN CLIMB UP INTO A HORSE TAIL AND ESCAPE JUST AS A CAT CLIMBS INTO A TREE TO ESCAPE FROM A DOG
7837-109174-0037 UNFORTUNATELY HE DOES NOT SUCCEED HE IS IN A SINKING CONDITION AND ONE OF THE WHIRLIGIGS FASTENS VORACIOUSLY UPON HIS HIND QUARTERS THE SUCCESSFUL CAPTOR HOWEVER IS GIVEN NO PEACE IN WHICH TO DEVOUR HIS PREY
7837-109174-0038 HE HAS TO LET IT GO AND SEIZE IT AND LET IT GO AGAIN AND NOW A LITTLE FISH A BLEAK BEGINS TO TAKE A PART IN THE PLAY THE FLUTTERING CHASE CONTINUES NOISELESSLY ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND URGED ON BY THE WHIRLIGIGS ABOVE AND THE BLEAK BENEATH
7837-109174-0039 THE MOTH APPROACHES THE REEDS WITH MUSCLES RELAXED AND DORSAL FIN LAID FLAT GRIM LIES MOTIONLESS AT ITS EDGE WHENCE AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE LITTLE SILVERY FISH
7837-109174-0040 ITS DELICATE BODY IS FAT OUTSIDE AND IN PLUMP AND WELL NOURISHED AND TO THE EYES OF THE FRATRICIDE IS AN IRRESISTIBLE TEMPTATION MAKING HER HUNGER CREEP OUT TO THE VERY TIPS OF HER TEETH
7837-109174-0041 WHILE HER EYES GREEDILY WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE NIMBLE LITTLE FISH FLASH FOLLOWS FLASH EACH BIGGER AND BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER GRIM FEELS THE EXCITEMENT AND ECSTASY OF THE SPOILER RUSH OVER HER
7837-109174-0042 ALL THAT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDES POSSESSION OF THE SPOIL AND DELIGHTS IN THE SENSATION SHE BEGINS TO CHANGE FROM HER STICK LIKE ATTITUDE AND IMPERCEPTIBLY TO BEND IN THE MIDDLE THE PLUMP LITTLE FISH IS TOO MUCH ENGROSSED IN ITS MOTH HUNT
7837-109174-0043 UNCONCERNEDLY IT LETS ITS BACK DISPLAY A VIVID BRIGHT GREEN LAKE HUE WHILE WITH ITS SILVERY BELLY IT REFLECTS ALL THE RAINBOW COLOURS OF THE WATER ANOTHER COUPLE OF SECONDS AND THE PREY IS NEAR
7837-109174-0044 THEN GRIM MAKES HER FIRST REAL LEAP IT IS SUCCESSFUL EVER SINCE SHE WAS THE LENGTH OF A DARNING NEEDLE SHE HAD DREAMT OF THIS LEAP DREAMT THAT IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL
7837-109174-0045 THE SEDGE WARBLER IN THE REEDY ISLAND HEARD THE SPLASH AND THE CLOSING SNAP OF THE JAWS THEY CLOSED WITH SUCH FIRMNESS THAT THE BIRD COULD FEEL AS IT WERE THE HELPLESS SIGH OF THE VICTIM
7837-109174-0046 AND THE GRATEFUL SATISFACTION OF THE PROMISING YOUNG PIRATE SHE WAS THE TIGER OF THE WATER SHE WOULD TAKE HER PREY BY CUNNING AND BY CRAFT AND BY TREACHEROUS ATTACK
7837-109174-0047 SHE WAS SELDOM ABLE TO SWIM STRAIGHT UP TO HER FOOD HOW COULD SHE CHASE THE NIMBLE ANTELOPES OF THE LAKE WHEN TIMID AND EASILY STARTLED THEY WERE GRAZING ON THE PLAINS OF THE DEEP WATERS
7837-109174-0048 THEY DISCOVERED HER BEFORE SHE GOT NEAR THEM AND COULD BEGIN HER LEAP HUGE HERDS WERE THERE FOR HER PLEASURE SHE HAD NO NEED TO EXERT HERSELF BUT COULD CHOOSE HER QUARRY IN EASE AND COMFORT
7837-109174-0049 THE LARGER ITS SIZE AND THE GREATER THE HUNGER AND LUST FOR MURDER THAT SHE FELT WITHIN HER THE MORE VIOLENCE AND ENERGY DID SHE PUT INTO THE LEAP BUT JUST AS THE FALCON MAY MISS ITS AIM SO MIGHT SHE AND IT MADE HER ASHAMED
7837-109174-0050 LIKE ANY OTHER BEAST OF PREY SHE DID NOT REPEAT THE LEAP BUT ONLY HASTENED AWAY BUT WHEN HER PREY WAS STRUGGLING IN HER HUNDRED TOOTHED JAWS AND SLAPPING HER ON THE MOUTH WITH ITS QUIVERING TAIL FIN
7837-109174-0051 THEN SLOWLY AND WITH A PECULIAR LINGERING ENJOYMENT SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF OUT FROM HER BENT LEAPING POSTURE IF SHE WAS HUNGRY SHE IMMEDIATELY SWALLOWED HER CAPTIVE BUT IF NOT SHE WAS FOND LIKE THE CAT
7837-109174-0052 OF PLAYING WITH HER VICTIM SWIMMING ABOUT WITH IT IN HER MOUTH TWISTING AND TURNING IT OVER AND CHEWING IT FOR HOURS BEFORE SHE COULD MAKE UP HER MIND TO SWALLOW IT SHE ATE
