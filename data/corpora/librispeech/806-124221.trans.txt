806-124221-0000 THE DEPARTMENT INTO WHICH MIKE WAS SENT WAS THE CASH OR TO BE MORE EXACT THAT SECTION OF IT WHICH WAS KNOWN AS PAYING CASHIER
806-124221-0001 DID NOT BELONG TO MIKE HIMSELF BUT TO MISTER WALLER MIKE'S WORK WAS LESS OSTENTATIOUS AND WAS PERFORMED WITH PEN INK AND LEDGERS IN THE BACKGROUND OCCASIONALLY WHEN MISTER WALLER WAS OUT AT LUNCH MIKE HAD TO ACT AS SUBSTITUTE FOR HIM
806-124221-0002 AND CASH CHEQUES BUT MISTER WALLER ALWAYS WENT OUT AT A SLACK TIME WHEN FEW CUSTOMERS CAME IN AND MIKE SELDOM HAD ANY VERY STARTLING SUM TO HAND OVER HE ENJOYED BEING IN THE CASH DEPARTMENT HE LIKED MISTER WALLER
806-124221-0003 THE WORK WAS EASY AND WHEN HE DID HAPPEN TO MAKE MISTAKES THEY WERE CORRECTED PATIENTLY BY THE GREY BEARDED ONE AND NOT USED AS LEVERS FOR BOOSTING HIM INTO THE PRESENCE OF MISTER BICKERSDYKE AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN SOME DEPARTMENTS THE CASHIER SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO MIKE
806-124221-0004 AND MIKE AS WAS USUALLY THE WAY WITH HIM WHEN PEOPLE WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO BE FRIENDLY WAS AT HIS BEST MIKE AT HIS EASE AND UNSUSPICIOUS OF HOSTILE INTENTIONS WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON FROM MIKE WITH HIS PRICKLES OUT
806-124221-0005 PSMITH MEANWHILE WAS NOT ENJOYING HIMSELF IT WAS AN UNHEARD OF THING HE SAID DEPRIVING A MAN OF HIS CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARY WITHOUT SO MUCH AS ASKING HIS LEAVE
806-124221-0006 IT HAS CAUSED ME THE GREATEST INCONVENIENCE HE TOLD MIKE DRIFTING ROUND IN A MELANCHOLY WAY TO THE CASH DEPARTMENT DURING A SLACK SPELL ONE AFTERNOON I MISS YOU AT EVERY TURN
806-124221-0007 YOUR KEEN INTELLIGENCE AND READY SYMPATHY WERE INVALUABLE TO ME NOW WHERE AM I IN THE CART I EVOLVED A SLIGHTLY BRIGHT THOUGHT ON LIFE JUST NOW THERE WAS NOBODY TO TELL IT TO EXCEPT THE NEW MAN I TOLD IT HIM AND THE FOOL GAPED
806-124221-0008 I TELL YOU COMRADE JACKSON I FEEL LIKE SOME LION THAT HAS BEEN ROBBED OF ITS CUB I FEEL AS MARSHALL WOULD FEEL IF THEY TOOK SNELGROVE AWAY FROM HIM
806-124221-0009 COMRADE ROSSITER DOES HIS BEST WE STILL TALK BROKENLY ABOUT MANCHESTER UNITED THEY GOT ROUTED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE CUP YESTERDAY AND COMRADE ROSSITER IS WEARING BLACK BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME
806-124221-0010 I TRY WORK BUT THAT IS NO GOOD EITHER FROM LEDGER TO LEDGER THEY HURRY ME TO STIFLE MY REGRET AND WHEN THEY WIN A SMILE FROM ME THEY THINK THAT I FORGET BUT I DON'T I AM A BROKEN MAN
806-124221-0011 THAT NEW EXHIBIT THEY'VE GOT IN YOUR PLACE IS ABOUT AS NEAR TO THE EXTREME EDGE AS ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN ONE OF NATURE'S BLIGHTERS WELL WELL I MUST AWAY COMRADE ROSSITER AWAITS ME
806-124221-0012 MIKE'S SUCCESSOR A YOUTH OF THE NAME OF BRISTOW WAS CAUSING PSMITH A GREAT DEAL OF PENSIVE MELANCHOLY HIS WORST DEFECT WHICH HE COULD NOT HELP WAS THAT HE WAS NOT MIKE HIS OTHERS WHICH HE COULD
806-124221-0013 WERE NUMEROUS HIS CLOTHES WERE CUT IN A WAY THAT HARROWED PSMITH'S SENSITIVE SOUL EVERY TIME HE LOOKED AT THEM THE FACT THAT HE WORE DETACHABLE CUFFS WHICH HE TOOK OFF ON BEGINNING WORK AND STACKED IN A GLISTENING PILE ON THE DESK IN FRONT OF HIM
806-124221-0014 WAS NO PROOF OF INNATE VICIOUSNESS OF DISPOSITION BUT IT PREJUDICED THE OLD ETONIAN AGAINST HIM IT WAS PART OF PSMITH'S PHILOSOPHY THAT A MAN WHO WORE DETACHABLE CUFFS HAD PASSED BEYOND THE LIMIT OF HUMAN TOLERATION
806-124221-0015 IN ADDITION BRISTOW WORE A SMALL BLACK MOUSTACHE AND A RING AND THAT AS PSMITH INFORMED MIKE PUT THE LID ON IT MIKE WOULD SOMETIMES STROLL ROUND TO THE POSTAGE DEPARTMENT TO LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO
806-124221-0016 BRISTOW WAS ALWAYS FRIENDLINESS ITSELF HE HABITUALLY ADDRESSED PSMITH AS SMITHY A FACT WHICH ENTERTAINED MIKE GREATLY BUT DID NOT SEEM TO AMUSE PSMITH TO ANY OVERWHELMING EXTENT ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN AS HE GENERALLY DID HE CALLED MIKE
806-124221-0017 MISTER CRICKETER THE HUMOUR OF THE THING APPEARED TO ELUDE MIKE THOUGH THE MODE OF ADDRESS ALWAYS DREW FROM PSMITH A PALE WAN SMILE AS OF A BROKEN HEART MADE CHEERFUL AGAINST ITS OWN INCLINATION
806-124221-0018 THE NET RESULT OF THE COMING OF BRISTOW WAS THAT PSMITH SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME WHEN NOT ACTUALLY OPPRESSED BY A RUSH OF WORK IN THE PRECINCTS OF THE CASH DEPARTMENT TALKING TO MIKE AND MISTER WALLER
806-124221-0019 THE LATTER DID NOT SEEM TO SHARE THE DISLIKE COMMON AMONG THE OTHER HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS OF SEEING HIS SUBORDINATES RECEIVING VISITORS UNLESS THE WORK WAS REALLY HEAVY IN WHICH CASE A MILD REMONSTRANCE ESCAPED HIM HE OFFERED NO OBJECTION TO MIKE BEING AT HOME TO PSMITH
806-124221-0020 IT WAS THIS TOLERANCE WHICH SOMETIMES GOT HIM INTO TROUBLE WITH MISTER BICKERSDYKE THE MANAGER DID NOT OFTEN PERAMBULATE THE OFFICE BUT HE DID OCCASIONALLY AND THE INTERVIEW WHICH ENSUED UPON HIS FINDING HUTCHINSON THE UNDERLING IN THE CASH DEPARTMENT AT THAT TIME
806-124221-0021 WITH HIS STOOL TILTED COMFORTABLY AGAINST THE WALL READING THE SPORTING NEWS FROM A PINK PAPER TO A FRIEND FROM THE OUTWARD BILLS DEPARTMENT WHO LAY LUXURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM DID NOT RANK AMONG MISTER WALLER'S PLEASANTEST MEMORIES
806-124221-0022 BUT MISTER WALLER WAS TOO SOFT HEARTED TO INTERFERE WITH HIS ASSISTANTS UNLESS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE NEW ASIATIC BANK WAS OVER STAFFED THERE WERE TOO MANY MEN FOR THE WORK
806-124221-0023 THE LONDON BRANCH OF THE BANK WAS REALLY ONLY A NURSERY NEW MEN WERE CONSTANTLY WANTED IN THE EASTERN BRANCHES SO THEY HAD TO BE PUT INTO THE LONDON BRANCH TO LEARN THE BUSINESS WHETHER THERE WAS ANY WORK FOR THEM TO DO OR NOT
806-124221-0024 IT WAS AFTER ONE OF THESE VISITS OF PSMITH'S THAT MISTER WALLER DISPLAYED A NEW AND UNSUSPECTED SIDE TO HIS CHARACTER PSMITH HAD COME ROUND IN A STATE OF SOME DEPRESSION TO DISCUSS BRISTOW AS USUAL
806-124221-0025 THAT PSMITH STOUTLY REFUSED TO SIT IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT WITH IT WHAT WITH COMRADES BRISTOW AND BICKERSDYKE COMBINED SAID PSMITH PLAINTIVELY THE WORK IS BECOMING TOO HARD FOR ME THE WHISPER IS BEGINNING TO CIRCULATE PSMITH'S NUMBER IS UP
806-124221-0026 AS A REFORMER HE IS MERELY AMONG THOSE PRESENT HE IS LOSING HIS DASH BUT WHAT CAN I DO I CANNOT KEEP AN EYE ON BOTH OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME THE MOMENT I CONCENTRATE MYSELF ON COMRADE BICKERSDYKE FOR A BRIEF SPELL AND SEEM TO BE DOING HIM A BIT OF GOOD
806-124221-0027 WHAT HAPPENS WHY COMRADE BRISTOW SNEAKS OFF AND BUYS A SORT OF WOOLLEN SUNSET I SAW THE THING UNEXPECTEDLY I TELL YOU I WAS SHAKEN IT IS THE SUDDENNESS OF THAT WAISTCOAT WHICH HITS YOU IT'S DISCOURAGING THIS SORT OF THING
806-124221-0028 I TRY ALWAYS TO THINK WELL OF MY FELLOW MAN AS AN ENERGETIC SOCIALIST I DO MY BEST TO SEE THE GOOD THAT IS IN HIM BUT IT'S HARD COMRADE BRISTOW'S THE MOST STRIKING ARGUMENT AGAINST THE EQUALITY OF MAN I'VE EVER COME ACROSS
806-124221-0029 MISTER WALLER INTERVENED AT THIS POINT I THINK YOU MUST REALLY LET JACKSON GO ON WITH HIS WORK SMITH HE SAID THERE SEEMS TO BE TOO MUCH TALKING MY BESETTING SIN SAID PSMITH SADLY
806-124221-0030 WELL WELL I WILL GO BACK AND DO MY BEST TO FACE IT BUT IT'S A TOUGH JOB HE TOTTERED WEARILY AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE POSTAGE DEPARTMENT OH JACKSON SAID MISTER WALLER
806-124221-0031 WILL YOU KINDLY TAKE MY PLACE FOR A FEW MINUTES I MUST GO ROUND AND SEE THE INWARD BILLS ABOUT SOMETHING I SHALL BE BACK VERY SOON MIKE WAS BECOMING ACCUSTOMED TO DEPUTIZING FOR THE CASHIER FOR SHORT SPACES OF TIME
806-124221-0032 IT GENERALLY HAPPENED THAT HE HAD TO DO SO ONCE OR TWICE A DAY STRICTLY SPEAKING PERHAPS MISTER WALLER WAS WRONG TO LEAVE SUCH AN IMPORTANT TASK AS THE ACTUAL CASHING OF CHEQUES TO AN INEXPERIENCED PERSON OF MIKE'S STANDING BUT THE NEW ASIATIC BANK DIFFERED FROM MOST BANKS
806-124221-0033 IN THAT THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF CROSS COUNTER WORK PEOPLE CAME IN FAIRLY FREQUENTLY TO CASH CHEQUES OF TWO OR THREE POUNDS BUT IT WAS RARE THAT ANY VERY LARGE DEALINGS TOOK PLACE HAVING COMPLETED HIS BUSINESS WITH THE INWARD BILLS
806-124221-0034 MISTER WALLER MADE HIS WAY BACK BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TAKING IN THE POSTAGE DESK HE FOUND PSMITH WITH A PALE SET FACE INSCRIBING FIGURES IN A LEDGER
806-124221-0035 THE OLD ETONIAN GREETED HIM WITH THE FAINT SMILE OF A PERSECUTED SAINT WHO IS DETERMINED TO BE CHEERFUL EVEN AT THE STAKE COMRADE BRISTOW HE SAID
806-124221-0036 HULLO SMITHY SAID THE OTHER TURNING PSMITH SADLY DIRECTED MISTER WALLER'S ATTENTION TO THE WAISTCOAT WHICH WAS CERTAINLY DEFINITE IN ITS COLOURING NOTHING SAID PSMITH I ONLY WANTED TO LOOK AT YOU
806-124221-0037 FUNNY ASS SAID BRISTOW RESUMING HIS WORK PSMITH GLANCED AT MISTER WALLER AS WHO SHOULD SAY SEE WHAT I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH AND YET I DO NOT GIVE WAY OH ER SMITH SAID MISTER WALLER
806-124221-0038 WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO JACKSON JUST NOW SAY NO MORE SAID PSMITH IT SHALL NOT OCCUR AGAIN WHY SHOULD I DISLOCATE THE WORK OF YOUR DEPARTMENT IN MY EFFORTS TO WIN A SYMPATHETIC WORD I WILL BEAR COMRADE BRISTOW LIKE A MAN HERE
806-124221-0039 AFTER ALL THERE ARE WORSE THINGS AT THE ZOO NO NO SAID MISTER WALLER HASTILY I DID NOT MEAN THAT BY ALL MEANS PAY US A VISIT NOW AND THEN IF IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH YOUR OWN WORK BUT I NOTICED JUST NOW THAT YOU SPOKE TO BRISTOW AS COMRADE BRISTOW
806-124221-0040 IT IS TOO TRUE SAID PSMITH I MUST CORRECT MYSELF OF THE HABIT HE WILL BE GETTING ABOVE HIMSELF AND WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING TO JACKSON YOU SPOKE OF YOURSELF AS A SOCIALIST SOCIALISM IS THE PASSION OF MY LIFE SAID PSMITH
806-124221-0041 MISTER WALLER'S FACE GREW ANIMATED HE STAMMERED IN HIS EAGERNESS I AM DELIGHTED HE SAID REALLY I AM DELIGHTED I ALSO A FELLOW WORKER IN THE CAUSE SAID PSMITH ER EXACTLY PSMITH EXTENDED HIS HAND GRAVELY
806-124221-0042 MISTER WALLER SHOOK IT WITH ENTHUSIASM I HAVE NEVER LIKED TO SPEAK OF IT TO ANYBODY IN THE OFFICE SAID MISTER WALLER BUT I TOO AM HEART AND SOUL IN THE MOVEMENT YOURS FOR THE REVOLUTION SAID PSMITH JUST SO JUST SO EXACTLY
806-124221-0043 THE FACT IS I AM IN THE HABIT OF SPEAKING ON SUNDAYS IN THE OPEN AIR AND HYDE PARK NO NO CLAPHAM COMMON IT IS ER HANDIER FOR ME WHERE I LIVE NOW AS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE MOVEMENT
806-124221-0044 I WAS THINKING THAT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT CARE TO COME AND HEAR ME SPEAK NEXT SUNDAY
806-124221-0045 I SHOULD LIKE TO EXCESSIVELY SAID PSMITH EXCELLENT BRING JACKSON WITH YOU AND BOTH OF YOU COME TO SUPPER AFTERWARDS IF YOU WILL THANKS VERY MUCH PERHAPS YOU WOULD SPEAK YOURSELF
806-124221-0046 I SELDOM SPEAK BUT IT WOULD BE A TREAT TO LISTEN TO YOU
806-124221-0047 OH WELL SAID MISTER WALLER PULLING NERVOUSLY AT HIS BEARD
806-124221-0048 I AM PERHAPS A LITTLE BITTER YES YES A LITTLE MORDANT AND IRONICAL YOU WOULD BE AGREED PSMITH I SHALL LOOK FORWARD TO SUNDAY WITH EVERY FIBRE QUIVERING AND COMRADE JACKSON SHALL BE AT MY SIDE
