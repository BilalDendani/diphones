8824-279153-0000 SENSATIONS AND IMAGES THE DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER IF WE HAVE BEEN RIGHT SO FAR CANNOT BE ALLOWED AS METAPHYSICALLY VALID NEVERTHELESS WE SEEM TO FIND A CERTAIN DUALISM PERHAPS NOT ULTIMATE
8824-279153-0001 WITHIN THE WORLD AS WE OBSERVE IT THE DUALISM IS NOT PRIMARILY AS TO THE STUFF OF THE WORLD BUT AS TO CAUSAL LAWS ON THIS SUBJECT WE MAY AGAIN QUOTE WILLIAM JAMES HE POINTS OUT THAT WHEN AS WE SAY WE MERELY IMAGINE THINGS
8824-279153-0002 THERE ARE NO SUCH EFFECTS AS WOULD ENSUE IF THE THINGS WERE WHAT WE CALL REAL HE TAKES THE CASE OF IMAGINING A FIRE
8824-279153-0003 I MAKE FOR MYSELF AN EXPERIENCE OF BLAZING FIRE I PLACE IT NEAR MY BODY BUT IT DOES NOT WARM ME IN THE LEAST I LAY A STICK UPON IT AND THE STICK EITHER BURNS OR REMAINS GREEN AS I PLEASE I CALL UP WATER
8824-279153-0004 AND POUR IT ON THE FIRE AND ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE ENSUES I ACCOUNT FOR ALL SUCH FACTS BY CALLING THIS WHOLE TRAIN OF EXPERIENCES UNREAL A MENTAL TRAIN MENTAL FIRE
8824-279153-0005 IS WHAT WON'T BURN REAL STICKS MENTAL WATER IS WHAT WON'T NECESSARILY THOUGH OF COURSE IT MAY PUT OUT EVEN A MENTAL FIRE WITH REAL OBJECTS ON THE CONTRARY CONSEQUENCES ALWAYS ACCRUE
8824-279153-0006 JUST AS MUCH AS PHYSICAL PHENOMENA DO BUT THEIR EFFECTS FOLLOW DIFFERENT LAWS FOR EXAMPLE DREAMS AS FREUD HAS SHOWN ARE JUST AS MUCH SUBJECT TO LAWS AS ARE THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANETS BUT THE LAWS ARE DIFFERENT IN A DREAM YOU MAY BE TRANSPORTED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER IN A MOMENT
8824-279153-0007 OR ONE PERSON MAY TURN INTO ANOTHER UNDER YOUR EYES SUCH DIFFERENCES COMPEL YOU TO DISTINGUISH THE WORLD OF DREAMS FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD IF THE TWO SORTS OF CAUSAL LAWS COULD BE SHARPLY DISTINGUISHED WE COULD CALL AN OCCURRENCE PHYSICAL WHEN IT OBEYS CAUSAL LAWS APPROPRIATE TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD
8824-279153-0008 AND MENTAL WHEN IT OBEYS CAUSAL LAWS APPROPRIATE TO THE MENTAL WORLD SINCE THE MENTAL WORLD AND THE PHYSICAL WORLD INTERACT THERE WOULD BE A BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE TWO THERE WOULD BE EVENTS WHICH WOULD HAVE PHYSICAL CAUSES AND MENTAL EFFECTS WHILE THERE WOULD BE OTHERS WHICH WOULD HAVE MENTAL CAUSES AND PHYSICAL EFFECTS
8824-279153-0009 THOSE THAT HAVE PHYSICAL CAUSES AND MENTAL EFFECTS WE SHOULD DEFINE AS SENSATIONS THOSE THAT HAVE MENTAL CAUSES AND PHYSICAL EFFECTS MIGHT PERHAPS BE IDENTIFIED WITH WHAT WE CALL VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS BUT THEY DO NOT CONCERN US AT PRESENT
8824-279153-0010 IF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSATION WERE CLEAR AND SHARP AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER THIS DISTINCTION IS AS YET BY NO MEANS SHARP IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WITH FULLER KNOWLEDGE IT WILL BE FOUND TO BE NO MORE ULTIMATE
8824-279153-0011 THAN THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LAWS OF GASES AND THE LAWS OF RIGID BODIES IT ALSO SUFFERS FROM THE FACT THAT AN EVENT MAY BE AN EFFECT OF SEVERAL CAUSES ACCORDING TO SEVERAL CAUSAL LAWS
8824-279153-0012 WE CANNOT IN GENERAL POINT TO ANYTHING UNIQUE AS THE CAUSE OF SUCH AND SUCH AN EVENT AND FINALLY IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT THE PECULIAR CAUSAL LAWS WHICH GOVERN MENTAL EVENTS
8824-279153-0013 THE LAW OF HABIT WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCTIVE MAY BE FULLY EXPLICABLE IN TERMS OF THE PECULIARITIES OF NERVOUS TISSUE AND THESE PECULIARITIES IN TURN MAY BE EXPLICABLE BY THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
8824-279153-0014 IT SEEMS THEREFORE THAT WE ARE DRIVEN TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF DEFINITION IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THE DEFINITION OF PERCEPTION WITH THIS DEFINITION WE CAN DEFINE A SENSATION AS THE NON MNEMIC ELEMENTS IN A PERCEPTION
8824-279153-0015 WHEN FOLLOWING OUR DEFINITION WE TRY TO DECIDE WHAT ELEMENTS IN OUR EXPERIENCE ARE OF THE NATURE OF SENSATIONS
8824-279153-0016 EVERYTHING IS SENSATION THAT COMES TO US THROUGH THE SENSES THE SIGHTS WE SEE THE SOUNDS WE HEAR THE SMELLS WE SMELL AND SO ON ALSO SUCH THINGS AS HEADACHE OR THE FEELING OF MUSCULAR STRAIN BUT IN ACTUAL FACT SO MUCH INTERPRETATION SO MUCH OF HABITUAL CORRELATION
8824-279153-0017 IS MIXED WITH ALL SUCH EXPERIENCES THAT THE CORE OF PURE SENSATION IS ONLY TO BE EXTRACTED BY CAREFUL INVESTIGATION TO TAKE A SIMPLE ILLUSTRATION IF YOU GO TO THE THEATRE IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY YOU SEEM TO HEAR EQUALLY WELL IN THE STALLS OR THE DRESS CIRCLE
8824-279153-0018 IN EITHER CASE YOU THINK YOU MISS NOTHING
8824-279153-0019 YOU WILL SEEM TO HAVE GROWN PARTIALLY DEAF AND YOU WILL FIND IT NECESSARY TO BE MUCH NEARER THE STAGE THAN YOU WOULD NEED TO BE IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY
8824-279153-0020 THE REASON IS THAT IN HEARING OUR OWN LANGUAGE SPOKEN WE QUICKLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY FILL OUT WHAT WE REALLY HEAR WITH INFERENCES TO WHAT THE MAN MUST BE SAYING AND WE NEVER REALIZE THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD THE WORDS WE HAVE MERELY INFERRED IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE THESE INFERENCES ARE MORE DIFFICULT
8824-279153-0021 AND WE ARE MORE DEPENDENT UPON ACTUAL SENSATION IF WE FOUND OURSELVES IN A FOREIGN WORLD WHERE TABLES LOOKED LIKE CUSHIONS AND CUSHIONS LIKE TABLES WE SHOULD SIMILARLY DISCOVER HOW MUCH OF WHAT WE THINK WE SEE IS REALLY INFERENCE
8824-279153-0022 I REMEMBER IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MOTOR CARS BEING WITH A FRIEND WHEN A TYRE BURST WITH A LOUD REPORT HE THOUGHT IT WAS A PISTOL AND SUPPORTED HIS OPINION BY MAINTAINING THAT HE HAD SEEN THE FLASH BUT OF COURSE THERE HAD BEEN NO FLASH NOWADAYS NO ONE SEES A FLASH WHEN A TYRE BURSTS
8824-279153-0023 IN ORDER THEREFORE TO ARRIVE AT WHAT REALLY IS SENSATION IN AN OCCURRENCE WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS TO CONTAIN NOTHING ELSE WE HAVE TO PARE AWAY ALL THAT IS DUE TO HABIT OR EXPECTATION OR INTERPRETATION
8824-279153-0024 THIS IS A MATTER FOR THE PSYCHOLOGIST AND BY NO MEANS AN EASY MATTER FOR OUR PURPOSES IT IS NOT IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE WHAT EXACTLY IS THE SENSATIONAL CORE IN ANY CASE IT IS ONLY IMPORTANT TO NOTICE
8824-279153-0025 THAT THERE CERTAINLY IS A SENSATIONAL CORE SINCE HABIT EXPECTATION AND INTERPRETATION ARE DIVERSELY AROUSED ON DIVERSE OCCASIONS AND THE DIVERSITY IS CLEARLY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN WHAT IS PRESENTED TO THE SENSES
8824-279153-0026 WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR NEWSPAPER IN THE MORNING THE ACTUAL SENSATIONS OF SEEING THE PRINT FORM A VERY MINUTE PART OF WHAT GOES ON IN YOU BUT THEY ARE THE STARTING POINT OF ALL THE REST AND IT IS THROUGH THEM THAT THE NEWSPAPER IS A MEANS OF INFORMATION OR MIS INFORMATION
8824-279153-0027 THUS ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT EXACTLY IS SENSATION IN ANY GIVEN EXPERIENCE
8824-279153-0028 WE DENY ALL ACTION OF THE OUTER WORLD UPON US SENSATIONS ARE OBVIOUSLY THE SOURCE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD INCLUDING OUR OWN BODY
8824-279153-0029 AND UNTIL LATELY I DID SO REGARD IT WHEN SAY I SEE A PERSON I KNOW COMING TOWARDS ME IN THE STREET IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE MERE SEEING WERE KNOWLEDGE
8824-279153-0030 IT IS OF COURSE UNDENIABLE THAT KNOWLEDGE COMES THROUGH THE SEEING BUT I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE TO REGARD THE MERE SEEING ITSELF AS KNOWLEDGE IF WE ARE SO TO REGARD IT WE MUST DISTINGUISH THE SEEING FROM WHAT IS SEEN WE MUST SAY THAT WHEN WE SEE A PATCH OF COLOUR OF A CERTAIN SHAPE
8824-279153-0031 THE PATCH OF COLOUR IS ONE THING AND OUR SEEING OF IT IS ANOTHER THIS VIEW HOWEVER DEMANDS THE ADMISSION OF THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN THE SENSE DISCUSSED IN OUR FIRST LECTURE IF THERE IS A SUBJECT IT CAN HAVE A RELATION TO THE PATCH OF COLOUR NAMELY
8824-279153-0032 THE SORT OF RELATION WHICH WE MIGHT CALL AWARENESS IN THAT CASE THE SENSATION AS A MENTAL EVENT WILL CONSIST OF AWARENESS OF THE COLOUR WHILE THE COLOUR ITSELF WILL REMAIN WHOLLY PHYSICAL AND MAY BE CALLED THE SENSE DATUM TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE SENSATION
8824-279153-0033 THE SUBJECT HOWEVER APPEARS TO BE A LOGICAL FICTION LIKE MATHEMATICAL POINTS AND INSTANTS IT IS INTRODUCED NOT BECAUSE OBSERVATION REVEALS IT BUT BECAUSE IT IS LINGUISTICALLY CONVENIENT AND APPARENTLY DEMANDED BY GRAMMAR
8824-279153-0034 NOMINAL ENTITIES OF THIS SORT MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST BUT THERE IS NO GOOD GROUND FOR ASSUMING THAT THEY DO THE FUNCTIONS THAT THEY APPEAR TO PERFORM CAN ALWAYS BE PERFORMED BY CLASSES OR SERIES OR OTHER LOGICAL CONSTRUCTIONS CONSISTING OF LESS DUBIOUS ENTITIES
8824-279153-0035 IF WE ARE TO AVOID A PERFECTLY GRATUITOUS ASSUMPTION WE MUST DISPENSE WITH THE SUBJECT AS ONE OF THE ACTUAL INGREDIENTS OF THE WORLD BUT WHEN WE DO THIS THE POSSIBILITY OF DISTINGUISHING THE SENSATION FROM THE SENSE DATUM VANISHES
8824-279153-0036 ACCORDINGLY THE SENSATION THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE SEE A PATCH OF COLOUR SIMPLY IS THAT PATCH OF COLOUR AN ACTUAL CONSTITUENT OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND PART OF WHAT PHYSICS IS CONCERNED WITH
8824-279153-0037 A PATCH OF COLOUR IS CERTAINLY NOT KNOWLEDGE AND THEREFORE WE CANNOT SAY THAT PURE SENSATION IS COGNITIVE THROUGH ITS PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS IT IS THE CAUSE OF COGNITIONS PARTLY BY BEING ITSELF A SIGN OF THINGS THAT ARE CORRELATED WITH IT
8824-279153-0038 AND PARTLY BY GIVING RISE TO IMAGES AND MEMORIES AFTER THE SENSATION IS FADED BUT IN ITSELF THE PURE SENSATION IS NOT COGNITIVE IN THE FIRST LECTURE WE CONSIDERED THE VIEW OF BRENTANO
8824-279153-0039 WE ARE NOW CONCERNED TO SHOW THAT IT MUST BE REJECTED IN THE PARTICULAR CASE OF SENSATIONS THE KIND OF ARGUMENT WHICH FORMERLY MADE ME ACCEPT BRENTANO'S VIEW IN THIS CASE WAS EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE
8824-279153-0040 WHILE MY SEEING IS NOT PHYSICAL BUT PSYCHICAL HENCE I CONCLUDED THAT THE COLOUR IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN MY SEEING OF THE COLOUR THIS ARGUMENT TO ME HISTORICALLY WAS DIRECTED AGAINST IDEALISM THE EMPHATIC PART OF IT
8824-279153-0041 I HAVE SET THEM FORTH BEFORE AND I SEE NO REASON TO MODIFY THEM BUT IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THE PATCH OF COLOUR IS NOT ALSO PSYCHICAL UNLESS WE ASSUME THAT THE PHYSICAL AND THE PSYCHICAL CANNOT OVERLAP WHICH I NO LONGER CONSIDER A VALID ASSUMPTION
8824-279153-0042 IF WE ADMIT AS I THINK WE SHOULD THAT THE PATCH OF COLOUR MAY BE BOTH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHICAL THE REASON FOR DISTINGUISHING THE SENSE DATUM FROM THE SENSATION DISAPPEARS AND WE MAY SAY THAT THE PATCH OF COLOUR AND OUR SENSATION IN SEEING IT ARE IDENTICAL
8824-279153-0043 THIS IS THE VIEW OF WILLIAM JAMES PROFESSOR DEWEY AND THE AMERICAN REALISTS PERCEPTIONS SAYS PROFESSOR DEWEY ARE NOT PER SE CASES OF KNOWLEDGE BUT SIMPLY NATURAL EVENTS WITH NO MORE KNOWLEDGE STATUS THAN SAY A SHOWER
8824-279153-0044 LET THEM THE REALISTS
8824-279153-0045 OF INNUMERABLE TRANSIENT PARTICULARS SUCH AS OCCUR IN SEEING HEARING ET CETERA TOGETHER WITH IMAGES MORE OR LESS RESEMBLING THESE OF WHICH I SHALL SPEAK SHORTLY IF PHYSICS IS TRUE THERE ARE BESIDES THE PARTICULARS THAT WE EXPERIENCE OTHERS PROBABLY EQUALLY OR ALMOST EQUALLY TRANSIENT
8824-279153-0046 BUT THIS TOPIC BELONGS TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF PHYSICS AND NEED NOT CONCERN US IN OUR PRESENT INQUIRY SENSATIONS ARE WHAT IS COMMON TO THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WORLDS THEY MAY BE DEFINED AS THE INTERSECTION OF MIND AND MATTER
8824-279153-0047 THIS IS BY NO MEANS A NEW VIEW IT IS ADVOCATED NOT ONLY BY THE AMERICAN AUTHORS I HAVE MENTIONED BUT BY MACH IN HIS ANALYSIS OF SENSATIONS WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX THE ESSENCE OF SENSATION ACCORDING TO THE VIEW I AM ADVOCATING
8824-279153-0048 IS ITS INDEPENDENCE OF PAST EXPERIENCE IT IS A CORE IN OUR ACTUAL EXPERIENCES NEVER EXISTING IN ISOLATION EXCEPT POSSIBLY IN VERY YOUNG INFANTS IT IS NOT ITSELF KNOWLEDGE BUT IT SUPPLIES THE DATA FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD INCLUDING OUR OWN BODIES
8824-279153-0049 THERE ARE SOME WHO BELIEVE THAT OUR MENTAL LIFE IS BUILT UP OUT OF SENSATIONS ALONE THIS MAY BE TRUE BUT IN ANY CASE I THINK THE ONLY INGREDIENTS REQUIRED IN ADDITION TO SENSATIONS ARE IMAGES WHAT IMAGES ARE AND HOW THEY ARE TO BE DEFINED WE HAVE NOW TO INQUIRE
8824-279153-0050 THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN IMAGES AND SENSATIONS MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT BY NO MEANS DIFFICULT WHEN WE SHUT OUR EYES AND CALL UP PICTURES OF FAMILIAR SCENES WE USUALLY HAVE NO DIFFICULTY SO LONG AS WE REMAIN AWAKE IN DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN WHAT WE ARE IMAGINING AND WHAT IS REALLY SEEN
8824-279153-0051 IF WE IMAGINE SOME PIECE OF MUSIC THAT WE KNOW WE CAN GO THROUGH IT IN OUR MIND FROM BEGINNING TO END WITHOUT ANY DISCOVERABLE TENDENCY TO SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE REALLY HEARING IT BUT ALTHOUGH SUCH CASES ARE SO CLEAR THAT NO CONFUSION SEEMS POSSIBLE
8824-279153-0052 THERE ARE MANY OTHERS THAT ARE FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND THE DEFINITION OF IMAGES IS BY NO MEANS AN EASY PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH WE DO NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHETHER WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS A SENSATION OR AN IMAGE THE THINGS WE SEE IN DREAMS WHEN OUR EYES ARE SHUT
8824-279153-0053 MUST COUNT AS IMAGES YET WHILE WE ARE DREAMING THEY SEEM LIKE SENSATIONS HALLUCINATIONS OFTEN BEGIN AS PERSISTENT IMAGES AND ONLY GRADUALLY ACQUIRE THAT INFLUENCE OVER BELIEF THAT MAKES THE PATIENT REGARD THEM AS SENSATIONS
8824-279153-0054 WHEN WE ARE LISTENING FOR A FAINT SOUND THE STRIKING OF A DISTANT CLOCK OR A HORSE'S HOOFS ON THE ROAD WE THINK WE HEAR IT MANY TIMES BEFORE WE REALLY DO
8824-279153-0055 TWO BY OUR ABSENCE OF BELIEF IN THEIR PHYSICAL REALITY THREE BY THE FACT THAT THEIR CAUSES AND EFFECTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF SENSATIONS
8824-279153-0056 THE OTHER TWO ARE APPLICABLE IN VERY MANY CASES BUT CANNOT BE USED FOR PURPOSES OF DEFINITION BECAUSE THEY ARE LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS NEVERTHELESS THEY BOTH DESERVE TO BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED ONE
8824-279153-0057 HUME WHO GIVES THE NAMES IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS TO WHAT MAY FOR PRESENT PURPOSES BE IDENTIFIED WITH OUR SENSATIONS AND IMAGES SPEAKS OF IMPRESSIONS AS THOSE PERCEPTIONS WHICH ENTER WITH MOST FORCE AND VIOLENCE
8824-279153-0058 WHILE HE DEFINES IDEAS AS THE FAINT IMAGES OF THESE
8824-279153-0059 IN THINKING AND REASONING HIS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS HOWEVER SHOW THE INADEQUACY OF HIS CRITERIA OF FORCE AND FAINTNESS
8824-279153-0060 EVERY ONE OF HIMSELF WILL READILY PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWIXT FEELING AND THINKING THE COMMON DEGREES OF THESE ARE EASILY DISTINGUISHED THOUGH IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IN PARTICULAR INSTANCES THEY MAY VERY NEARLY APPROACH TO EACH OTHER
8824-279153-0061 THUS IN SLEEP IN A FEVER
8824-279153-0062 AS ON THE OTHER HAND IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT OUR IMPRESSIONS ARE SO FAINT AND LOW THAT WE CANNOT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM OUR IDEAS
8824-279153-0063 THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF A DEFINITION IS TO PROVIDE A MARK WHICH IS APPLICABLE EVEN IN MARGINAL CASES EXCEPT OF COURSE WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH A CONCEPTION LIKE
8824-279153-0064 HAS AN AGGRESSIVENESS WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO THE IMAGE IT STRIKES THE MIND WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FORCE OR LIVELINESS
8824-279153-0065 THAT SUGGESTION WHOSE HORRID IMAGE DOTH UNFIX MY HAIR AND MAKE MY SEATED HEART KNOCK AT MY RIBS AGAINST THE USE OF NATURE
8824-279153-0066 THE WHISTLE OF A STEAM ENGINE COULD HARDLY HAVE A STRONGER EFFECT THAN THIS A VERY INTENSE EMOTION WILL OFTEN BRING WITH IT ESPECIALLY WHERE SOME FUTURE ACTION OR SOME UNDECIDED ISSUE IS INVOLVED POWERFUL COMPELLING IMAGES
8824-279153-0067 THERE MUST BE JUST THAT FORCE OR LIVELINESS WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE ALWAYS ABSENT FROM IMAGES THE CASES OF DREAMS
8824-279153-0068 I CONCLUDE THEREFORE THAT THE TEST OF LIVELINESS HOWEVER APPLICABLE IN ORDINARY INSTANCES CANNOT BE USED TO DEFINE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SENSATIONS AND IMAGES TWO
8824-279153-0069 WE MIGHT ATTEMPT TO DISTINGUISH IMAGES FROM SENSATIONS BY OUR ABSENCE OF BELIEF IN THE PHYSICAL REALITY OF IMAGES WHEN WE ARE AWARE THAT WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS AN IMAGE
8824-279153-0070 WE DO NOT THINK THAT IT HAS THE SAME POWER OF PRODUCING KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD IMAGES ARE IMAGINARY IN SOME SENSE THEY ARE UNREAL
8824-279153-0071 WHAT WE CALL THE UNREALITY OF IMAGES REQUIRES INTERPRETATION
8824-279153-0072 WHEN WE CALL UP A VISUAL IMAGE OF A CHAIR WE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SIT IN IT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT LIKE MACBETH'S DAGGER IT IS NOT SENSIBLE TO FEELING AS TO SIGHT
8824-279153-0073 WHICH IT WOULD HAVE IF IT WERE A VISUAL SENSATION AND NOT MERELY A VISUAL IMAGE BUT THIS MEANS THAT THE SO CALLED UNREALITY OF IMAGES CONSISTS MERELY IN THEIR NOT OBEYING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
8824-279153-0074 AND THUS BRINGS US BACK TO THE CAUSAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN IMAGES AND SENSATIONS THIS VIEW IS CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT WE ONLY FEEL IMAGES TO BE UNREAL WHEN WE ALREADY KNOW THEM TO BE IMAGES IMAGES CANNOT BE DEFINED BY THE FEELING OF UNREALITY
8824-279153-0075 BECAUSE WHEN WE FALSELY BELIEVE AN IMAGE TO BE A SENSATION AS IN THE CASE OF DREAMS IT FEELS JUST AS REAL AS IF IT WERE A SENSATION OUR FEELING OF UNREALITY RESULTS FROM OUR HAVING ALREADY REALIZED THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH AN IMAGE
8824-279153-0076 AND CANNOT THEREFORE BE THE DEFINITION OF WHAT WE MEAN BY AN IMAGE AS SOON AS AN IMAGE BEGINS TO DECEIVE US AS TO ITS STATUS IT ALSO DECEIVES US AS TO ITS CORRELATIONS WHICH ARE WHAT WE MEAN BY ITS REALITY THREE
8824-279153-0077 THIS BRINGS US TO THE THIRD MODE OF DISTINGUISHING IMAGES FROM SENSATIONS NAMELY BY THEIR CAUSES AND EFFECTS I BELIEVE THIS TO BE THE ONLY VALID GROUND OF DISTINCTION JAMES IN THE PASSAGE ABOUT THE MENTAL FIRE WHICH WON'T BURN REAL STICKS
8824-279153-0078 SENSATIONS COME THROUGH SENSE ORGANS WHILE IMAGES DO NOT WE CANNOT HAVE VISUAL SENSATIONS IN THE DARK OR WITH OUR EYES SHUT BUT WE CAN VERY WELL HAVE VISUAL IMAGES UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ACCORDINGLY IMAGES HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS CENTRALLY EXCITED SENSATIONS
8824-279153-0079 NOT ALSO IN THE SENSE ORGANS AND THE NERVES THAT RUN FROM THE SENSE ORGANS TO THE BRAIN I THINK THE PHRASE CENTRALLY EXCITED SENSATIONS ASSUMES MORE THAN IS NECESSARY SINCE IT TAKES IT FOR GRANTED THAT AN IMAGE MUST HAVE A PROXIMATE PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSE
8824-279153-0080 THIS IS PROBABLY TRUE BUT IT IS AN HYPOTHESIS AND FOR OUR PURPOSES AN UNNECESSARY ONE IT WOULD SEEM TO FIT BETTER WITH WHAT WE CAN IMMEDIATELY OBSERVE IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT AN IMAGE IS OCCASIONED THROUGH ASSOCIATION
8824-279153-0081 IN OTHER WORDS THAT IT HAS A MNEMIC CAUSE WHICH DOES NOT PREVENT IT FROM ALSO HAVING A PHYSICAL CAUSE
8824-279153-0082 IT IS GOVERNED BY HABIT AND PAST EXPERIENCE IF YOU LISTEN TO A MAN PLAYING THE PIANOLA WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM YOU WILL HAVE IMAGES OF HIS HANDS ON THE KEYS AS IF HE WERE PLAYING THE PIANO
8824-279153-0083 WHEN HABIT AND PAST EXPERIENCE PLAY THIS PART WE ARE IN THE REGION OF MNEMIC AS OPPOSED TO ORDINARY PHYSICAL CAUSATION AND I THINK THAT IF WE COULD REGARD AS ULTIMATELY VALID THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND MNEMIC CAUSATION
8824-279153-0084 WE COULD DISTINGUISH IMAGES FROM SENSATIONS AS HAVING MNEMIC CAUSES THOUGH THEY MAY ALSO HAVE PHYSICAL CAUSES SENSATIONS ON THE OTHER HAND WILL ONLY HAVE PHYSICAL CAUSES HOWEVER THIS MAY BE
8824-279153-0085 THE PRACTICALLY EFFECTIVE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SENSATIONS AND IMAGES IS THAT IN THE CAUSATION OF SENSATIONS BUT NOT OF IMAGES THE STIMULATION OF NERVES CARRYING AN EFFECT INTO THE BRAIN USUALLY FROM THE SURFACE OF THE BODY PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL PART
8824-279153-0086 AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT IMAGES AND SENSATIONS CANNOT ALWAYS BE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR INTRINSIC NATURE IMAGES ALSO DIFFER FROM SENSATIONS AS REGARDS THEIR EFFECTS SENSATIONS AS A RULE HAVE BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EFFECTS
8824-279153-0087 AS YOU WATCH THE TRAIN YOU MEANT TO CATCH LEAVING THE STATION
8824-279153-0088 AND THE SUCCESSIVE WAVES OF FURY AND DISAPPOINTMENT MENTAL EFFECTS IMAGES ON THE CONTRARY THOUGH THEY MAY PRODUCE BODILY MOVEMENTS DO SO ACCORDING TO MNEMIC LAWS NOT ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
8824-279153-0089 ALL THEIR EFFECTS OF WHATEVER NATURE FOLLOW MNEMIC LAWS BUT THIS DIFFERENCE IS LESS SUITABLE FOR DEFINITION THAN THE DIFFERENCE AS TO CAUSES PROFESSOR WATSON AS A LOGICAL CARRYING OUT OF HIS BEHAVIOURIST THEORY
8824-279153-0090 DENIES ALTOGETHER THAT THERE ARE ANY OBSERVABLE PHENOMENA SUCH AS IMAGES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HE REPLACES THEM ALL BY FAINT SENSATIONS
8824-279153-0091 WHEN WE THINK OF A TABLE SAY AS OPPOSED TO SEEING IT WHAT HAPPENS ACCORDING TO HIM IS USUALLY THAT WE ARE MAKING SMALL MOVEMENTS OF THE THROAT AND TONGUE SUCH AS WOULD LEAD TO OUR UTTERING THE WORD TABLE
8824-279153-0092 I SHALL CONSIDER HIS VIEW AGAIN IN CONNECTION WITH WORDS FOR THE PRESENT I AM ONLY CONCERNED TO COMBAT HIS DENIAL OF IMAGES THIS DENIAL IS SET FORTH BOTH IN HIS BOOK ON BEHAVIOR AND IN AN ARTICLE CALLED IMAGE AND AFFECTION IN BEHAVIOR
8824-279153-0093 PLAIN FACTS IN THE INTERESTS OF A THEORY NAMELY THE SUPPOSED IMPOSSIBILITY OF INTROSPECTION
8824-279153-0094 I WISH TO REINFORCE THE VIEW THAT THE FACTS ARE UNDENIABLE IMAGES ARE OF VARIOUS SORTS ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE SENSATIONS WHICH THEY COPY
8824-279153-0095 IMAGES OF BODILY MOVEMENTS SUCH AS WE HAVE WHEN WE IMAGINE MOVING AN ARM OR ON A SMALLER SCALE PRONOUNCING A WORD MIGHT POSSIBLY BE EXPLAINED AWAY ON PROFESSOR WATSON'S LINES AS REALLY CONSISTING IN SMALL INCIPIENT MOVEMENTS SUCH AS IF MAGNIFIED AND PROLONGED
8824-279153-0096 WOULD BE THE MOVEMENTS WE ARE SAID TO BE IMAGINING WHETHER THIS IS THE CASE OR NOT MIGHT EVEN BE DECIDED EXPERIMENTALLY IF THERE WERE A DELICATE INSTRUMENT FOR RECORDING SMALL MOVEMENTS IN THE MOUTH AND THROAT
8824-279153-0097 WE MIGHT PLACE SUCH AN INSTRUMENT IN A PERSON'S MOUTH AND THEN TELL HIM TO RECITE A POEM TO HIMSELF AS FAR AS POSSIBLE ONLY IN IMAGINATION I SHOULD NOT BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF IT WERE FOUND THAT ACTUAL SMALL MOVEMENTS TAKE PLACE WHILE HE IS MENTALLY SAYING OVER THE VERSES
8824-279153-0098 THE POINT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT IS CALLED THOUGHT CONSISTS MAINLY THOUGH I THINK NOT WHOLLY OF INNER SPEECH IF PROFESSOR WATSON IS RIGHT AS REGARDS INNER SPEECH THIS WHOLE REGION IS TRANSFERRED FROM IMAGINATION TO SENSATION
8824-279153-0099 BUT SINCE THE QUESTION IS CAPABLE OF EXPERIMENTAL DECISION IT WOULD BE GRATUITOUS RASHNESS TO OFFER AN OPINION WHILE THAT DECISION IS LACKING BUT VISUAL AND AUDITORY IMAGES ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH IN THIS WAY
8824-279153-0100 BECAUSE THEY LACK THE CONNECTION WITH PHYSICAL EVENTS IN THE OUTER WORLD WHICH BELONGS TO VISUAL AND AUDITORY SENSATIONS SUPPOSE FOR EXAMPLE THAT I AM SITTING IN MY ROOM IN WHICH THERE IS AN EMPTY ARM CHAIR
8824-279153-0101 I SHUT MY EYES AND CALL UP A VISUAL IMAGE OF A FRIEND SITTING IN THE ARM CHAIR IF I THRUST MY IMAGE INTO THE WORLD OF PHYSICS IT CONTRADICTS ALL THE USUAL PHYSICAL LAWS MY FRIEND REACHED THE CHAIR WITHOUT COMING IN AT THE DOOR IN THE USUAL WAY
8824-279153-0102 SUBSEQUENT INQUIRY WILL SHOW THAT HE WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE AT THE MOMENT IF REGARDED AS A SENSATION MY IMAGE HAS ALL THE MARKS OF THE SUPERNATURAL MY IMAGE THEREFORE IS REGARDED AS AN EVENT IN ME
8824-279153-0103 NOT AS HAVING THAT POSITION IN THE ORDERLY HAPPENINGS OF THE PUBLIC WORLD THAT BELONGS TO SENSATIONS BY SAYING THAT IT IS AN EVENT IN ME WE LEAVE IT POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY BE PHYSIOLOGICALLY CAUSED ITS PRIVACY MAY BE ONLY DUE TO ITS CONNECTION WITH MY BODY
8824-279153-0104 BUT IN ANY CASE IT IS NOT A PUBLIC EVENT LIKE AN ACTUAL PERSON WALKING IN AT THE DOOR AND SITTING DOWN IN MY CHAIR AND IT CANNOT LIKE INNER SPEECH BE REGARDED AS A SMALL SENSATION SINCE IT OCCUPIES JUST AS LARGE AN AREA IN MY VISUAL FIELD AS THE ACTUAL SENSATION WOULD DO
8824-279153-0105 THIS VIEW SEEMS TO ME FLATLY TO CONTRADICT EXPERIENCE IF YOU TRY TO PERSUADE ANY UNEDUCATED PERSON THAT SHE CANNOT CALL UP A VISUAL PICTURE OF A FRIEND SITTING IN A CHAIR BUT CAN ONLY USE WORDS DESCRIBING WHAT SUCH AN OCCURRENCE WOULD BE LIKE
8824-279153-0106 SHE WILL CONCLUDE THAT YOU ARE MAD THIS STATEMENT IS BASED UPON EXPERIMENT GALTON AS EVERY ONE KNOWS INVESTIGATED VISUAL IMAGERY AND FOUND THAT EDUCATION TENDS TO KILL IT THE FELLOWS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY TURNED OUT TO HAVE MUCH LESS OF IT THAN THEIR WIVES
8824-279153-0107 I SEE NO REASON TO DOUBT HIS CONCLUSION THAT THE HABIT OF ABSTRACT PURSUITS MAKES LEARNED MEN MUCH INFERIOR TO THE AVERAGE IN POWER OF VISUALIZING AND MUCH MORE EXCLUSIVELY OCCUPIED WITH WORDS IN THEIR THINKING AND PROFESSOR WATSON IS A VERY LEARNED MAN
8824-279153-0108 I SHALL HENCEFORTH ASSUME THAT THE EXISTENCE OF IMAGES IS ADMITTED AND THAT THEY ARE TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM SENSATIONS BY THEIR CAUSES AS WELL AS IN A LESSER DEGREE BY THEIR EFFECTS IN THEIR INTRINSIC NATURE
8824-279153-0109 THOUGH THEY OFTEN DIFFER FROM SENSATIONS BY BEING MORE DIM OR VAGUE OR FAINT YET THEY DO NOT ALWAYS OR UNIVERSALLY DIFFER FROM SENSATIONS IN ANY WAY THAT CAN BE USED FOR DEFINING THEM
8824-279153-0110 THEIR PRIVACY NEED FORM NO BAR TO THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THEM ANY MORE THAN THE PRIVACY OF BODILY SENSATIONS DOES BODILY SENSATIONS ARE ADMITTED BY EVEN THE MOST SEVERE CRITICS OF INTROSPECTION ALTHOUGH LIKE IMAGES THEY CAN ONLY BE OBSERVED BY ONE OBSERVER
8824-279153-0111 THERE REMAINS ONE VERY IMPORTANT POINT CONCERNING IMAGES WHICH WILL OCCUPY US MUCH HEREAFTER AND THAT IS THEIR RESEMBLANCE TO PREVIOUS SENSATIONS THEY ARE SAID TO BE COPIES OF SENSATIONS ALWAYS AS REGARDS THE SIMPLE QUALITIES THAT ENTER INTO THEM
8824-279153-0112 ON THIS SUBJECT HUME IS THE CLASSIC HE SAYS IN THE DEFINITIONS ALREADY QUOTED
8824-279153-0113 THOSE PERCEPTIONS WHICH ENTER WITH MOST FORCE AND VIOLENCE WE MAY NAME IMPRESSIONS AND UNDER THIS NAME I COMPREHEND ALL OUR SENSATIONS PASSIONS AND EMOTIONS AS THEY MAKE THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE SOUL BY IDEAS I MEAN THE FAINT IMAGES OF THESE IN THINKING AND REASONING
8824-279153-0114 BUT AS REGARDS SIMPLE IDEAS HE STATES THAT EVERY SIMPLE IDEA HAS A SIMPLE IMPRESSION WHICH RESEMBLES IT
8824-279153-0115 OF KNOWLEDGE GENERALLY THE RECOGNIZABLE RESEMBLANCE OF IMAGES AND SENSATIONS IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES IN ESTABLISHING HUME'S PRINCIPLES AND DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER IT IS EXACTLY TRUE
8824-279153-0116 NEVERTHELESS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT THAT IN THE MAIN SIMPLE IMAGES ARE COPIES OF SIMILAR SIMPLE SENSATIONS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED EARLIER AND THAT THE SAME IS TRUE OF COMPLEX IMAGES IN ALL CASES OF MEMORY AS OPPOSED TO MERE IMAGINATION
8824-279153-0117 OUR POWER OF ACTING WITH REFERENCE TO WHAT IS SENSIBLY ABSENT IS LARGELY DUE TO THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF IMAGES ALTHOUGH AS EDUCATION ADVANCES IMAGES TEND TO BE MORE AND MORE REPLACED BY WORDS
8824-279153-0118 WE SHALL HAVE MUCH TO SAY IN THE NEXT TWO LECTURES ON THE SUBJECT OF IMAGES AS COPIES OF SENSATIONS WHAT HAS BEEN SAID NOW IS MERELY BY WAY OF REMINDER THAT THIS IS THEIR MOST NOTABLE CHARACTERISTIC I AM BY NO MEANS CONFIDENT
8824-279153-0119 THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN IMAGES AND SENSATIONS IS ULTIMATELY VALID AND I SHOULD BE GLAD TO BE CONVINCED THAT IMAGES CAN BE REDUCED TO SENSATIONS OF A PECULIAR KIND I THINK IT IS CLEAR HOWEVER THAT AT ANY RATE IN THE CASE OF AUDITORY AND VISUAL IMAGES
8824-279153-0120 THEY DO DIFFER FROM ORDINARY AUDITORY AND VISUAL SENSATIONS AND THEREFORE FORM A RECOGNIZABLE CLASS OF OCCURRENCES EVEN IF IT SHOULD PROVE THAT THEY CAN BE REGARDED AS A SUB CLASS OF SENSATIONS
