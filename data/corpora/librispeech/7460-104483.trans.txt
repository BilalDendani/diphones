7460-104483-0000 CHAPTER TEN SIR MAGNUS MOUNTJOY IT WAS THE PECULIARITY OF FLORENCE MOUNTJOY THAT SHE DID NOT EXPECT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE AS GOOD AS HERSELF IT WAS NOT THAT SHE ERECTED FOR HERSELF A HIGH STANDARD
7460-104483-0001 AND HAD THEN TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO DEMAND FROM OTHERS ONE SO EXALTED SHE HAD ERECTED NOTHING NOR DID SHE KNOW THAT SHE ATTEMPTED TO LIVE BY GRAND RULES SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT SHE WAS BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
7460-104483-0002 BUT IT CAME TO HER NATURALLY AS THE RESULT OF WHAT HAD GONE BEFORE
7460-104483-0003 GENEROUS TRUSTING AND PURE THESE MAY BE REGARDED AS FEMININE VIRTUES AND MAY BE SAID TO BE SOMETIMES TARNISHED BY FAULTS WHICH ARE EQUALLY FEMININE UNSELFISHNESS MAY BECOME WANT OF CHARACTER GENEROSITY ESSENTIALLY UNJUST
7460-104483-0004 CONFIDENCE MAY BE WEAK AND PURITY INSIPID HERE IT WAS THAT THE STRENGTH OF FLORENCE MOUNTJOY ASSERTED ITSELF SHE KNEW WELL WHAT WAS DUE TO HERSELF THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT CLAIM IT SHE COULD TRUST TO ANOTHER
7460-104483-0005 BUT IN SILENCE BE QUITE SURE OF HERSELF THOUGH PURE HERSELF SHE WAS RARELY SHOCKED BY THE WAYS OF OTHERS AND SHE WAS AS TRUE AS A MAN PRETENDS TO BE IN FIGURE FORM AND FACE
7460-104483-0006 SHE NEVER DEMANDED IMMEDIATE HOMAGE BY THE SUDDEN FLASH OF HER BEAUTY BUT WHEN HER SPELL HAD ONCE FALLEN ON A MAN'S SPIRIT IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE COULD ESCAPE FROM IT QUICKLY WHEN SHE SPOKE A PECULIAR MELODY STRUCK THE HEARER'S EARS
7460-104483-0007 HER VOICE WAS SOFT AND LOW AND SWEET
7460-104483-0008 BUT WHEN SHE LAUGHED IT WAS LIKE SOFT WINDS PLAYING AMONG COUNTLESS SILVER BELLS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER TOUCH WHICH TO MEN WAS ALMOST DIVINE OF THIS SHE WAS ALL UNCONSCIOUS
7460-104483-0009 BUT WAS AS CHARY WITH HER FINGERS AS THOUGH IT SEEMED THAT SHE COULD ILL SPARE HER DIVINITY IN HEIGHT SHE WAS A LITTLE ABOVE THE COMMON
7460-104483-0010 BUT THEN IT IS KNOWN OF THEM AND MOMENTARILY SEEN THAT THEIR GRACE IS PECULIAR
7460-104483-0011 AND THE RESULT IS THERE ONLY TOO EVIDENT BUT FLORENCE SEEMED TO HAVE STUDIED NOTHING THE BEHOLDER FELT THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN AS GRACEFUL WHEN PLAYING WITH HER DOLL IN THE NURSERY AND IT WAS THE SAME WITH HER BEAUTY
7460-104483-0012 THERE WAS NO PECULIARITY OF CHISELLED FEATURES HAD YOU TAKEN HER FACE AND MEASURED IT BY CERTAIN RULES YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT HER MOUTH WAS TOO LARGE AND HER NOSE IRREGULAR
7460-104483-0013 AND IN HER COMPLEXION THERE WAS NONE OF THAT PELLUCID CLEARNESS IN WHICH MEN ORDINARILY DELIGHT BUT HER EYES WERE MORE THAN ORDINARILY BRIGHT AND WHEN SHE LAUGHED THERE SEEMED TO STREAM FROM THEM SOME HEAVENLY DELIGHT
7460-104483-0014 WHEN SHE DID LAUGH IT WAS AS THOUGH SOME SPRING HAD BEEN OPENED FROM WHICH RAN FOR THE TIME A STREAM OF SWEETEST INTIMACY
7460-104483-0015 YOU WOULD FEEL THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ALSO IN YOURSELF IN THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERMITTED
7460-104483-0016 OF THE HUE MOST COMMON TO MEN AND WOMEN AND HAD IN THEM NOTHING THAT WAS PECULIAR BUT HER HAIR WAS SOFT AND SMOOTH AND EVER WELL DRESSED AND NEVER REDOLENT OF PECULIAR ODORS IT WAS SIMPLY FLORENCE MOUNTJOY'S HAIR
7460-104483-0017 AND THAT MADE IT PERFECT IN THE EYES OF HER MALE FRIENDS GENERALLY SHE'S NOT SUCH A WONDERFUL BEAUTY AFTER ALL ONCE SAID OF HER A GENTLEMAN TO WHOM IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT SHE HAD NOT TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO BE PECULIARLY ATTRACTIVE
7460-104483-0018 NO SAID ANOTHER NO BUT BY GEORGE I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO HAVE THE ALTERING OF HER IT WAS THUS THAT MEN GENERALLY FELT IN REGARD TO FLORENCE MOUNTJOY WHEN THEY CAME TO RECKON HER UP THEY DID NOT SEE HOW ANY CHANGE WAS TO BE MADE
7460-104483-0019 FOR THE BETTER TO FLORENCE AS TO MOST OTHER GIRLS THE QUESTION OF HER FUTURE LIFE HAD BEEN A GREAT TROUBLE WHOM SHOULD SHE MARRY AND WHOM SHOULD SHE DECLINE TO MARRY
7460-104483-0020 TO A GIRL WHEN IT IS PROPOSED TO HER SUDDENLY TO CHANGE EVERYTHING IN LIFE TO GO ALTOGETHER AWAY AND PLACE HERSELF UNDER THE CUSTODY OF A NEW MASTER TO FIND FOR HERSELF A NEW HOME NEW PURSUITS
7460-104483-0021 NEW ASPIRATIONS AND A STRANGE COMPANION THE CHANGE MUST BE SO COMPLETE AS ALMOST TO FRIGHTEN HER BY ITS AWFULNESS AND YET IT HAS TO BE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AND GENERALLY DONE
7460-104483-0022 BUT THIS CHANGE HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO FLORENCE IN A MANNER MORE THAN ORDINARILY BURDENSOME EARLY IN LIFE WHEN NATURALLY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEGUN TO THINK SERIOUSLY OF MARRIAGE SHE HAD BEEN TOLD RATHER THAN ASKED TO GIVE HERSELF
7460-104483-0023 TO HER COUSIN MOUNTJOY SHE WAS TOO FIRM OF CHARACTER TO ACCEDE AT ONCE TO DELIVER HERSELF OVER BODY AND SOUL TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF ONE IN TRUTH UNKNOWN BUT SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO INTERPOSE ANY REASON THAT WAS VALID
7460-104483-0024 AND HAD CONTENTED HERSELF BY DEMANDING TIME SINCE THAT THERE HAD BEEN MOMENTS IN WHICH SHE HAD ALMOST YIELDED MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH HAD BEEN SO REPRESENTED TO HER THAT SHE HAD CONSIDERED IT TO BE ALMOST A DUTY TO YIELD
7460-104483-0025 MORE THAN ONCE THE WORD HAD BEEN ALL BUT SPOKEN BUT THE WORD HAD NEVER BEEN SPOKEN SHE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED CRUEL PRESSURE IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON HER MOTHER HAD REPRESENTED AS A DUTY THIS MARRIAGE WITH HER COUSIN
7460-104483-0026 WHY SHOULD SHE NOT MARRY HER COUSIN IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE QUESTIONS HAD BEEN ASKED BEFORE ANY OF THE TERRIBLE FACTS OF CAPTAIN SCARBOROUGH'S LIFE HAD BEEN MADE KNOWN TO HER BECAUSE IT MAY BE SAID SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM
7460-104483-0027 BUT IN THESE DAYS SHE HAD LOVED NO MAN AND WAS INCLINED TO THINK SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AS TO MAKE HER WANT OF LOVE NO NECESSARY BAR TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE WISH OF OTHERS BY DEGREES
7460-104483-0028 AND THOUGH SHE EVER DENIED THE IMPUTATION THERE CAME OVER HER GIRL'S HEART A FEELING VERY SAD AND VERY SOLEMN BUT STILL ALL BUT ACCEPTED THAT SO IT MUST BE THEN
7460-104483-0029 BUT WAS ALMOST SURE THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO BECOME THE WIFE OF MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH
7460-104483-0030 AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE PERSONAL MANNERS OF HER COUSIN WHICH SEEMED TO JUSTIFY HER IN DECLARING HER ABHORRENCE HE WAS A DARK HANDSOME MILITARY LOOKING MAN WHOSE CHIEF SIN IT WAS IN THE EYES OF HIS COUSIN THAT HE SEEMED TO DEMAND FROM HER AFFECTION
7460-104483-0031 WORSHIP AND OBEDIENCE
7460-104483-0032 BUT SHE FELT IT AND WHEN IT CAME TO PASS THAT TIDINGS OF HIS DEBTS AT LAST REACHED HER SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS GLAD OF AN EXCUSE THOUGH SHE KNEW THAT THE EXCUSE WOULD NOT HAVE PREVAILED WITH HER HAD SHE LIKED HIM THEN CAME HIS DEBTS
7460-104483-0033 AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEM A KEENER PERCEPTION OF HIS IMPERIOUSNESS SHE COULD CONSENT TO BECOME THE WIFE OF THE MAN WHO HAD SQUANDERED HIS PROPERTY AND WASTED HIS ESTATE BUT NOT OF ONE WHO BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE DEMANDED OF HER THAT SUBMISSION WHICH
7460-104483-0034 AS SHE THOUGHT SHOULD BE GIVEN BY HER FREELY AFTER HER MARRIAGE
7460-104483-0035 SHE KNEW THAT HE ADORED HER BUT YET HE DID NOT HASTEN TO TELL HER SO SHE KNEW THAT SHE LOVED HIM BUT SHE DOUBTED WHETHER A TIME WOULD EVER COME IN WHICH SHE COULD CONFESS IT IT WAS NOT
7460-104483-0036 TILL HE HAD COME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TROUBLE TO WHICH MOUNTJOY HAD SUBJECTED HIM THAT HE HAD EVER VENTURED TO SPEAK PLAINLY OF HIS OWN PASSION AND EVEN THEN HE HAD NOT ASKED FOR A REPLY SHE WAS STILL FREE AS SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THIS
7460-104483-0037 BUT SHE DID AT LAST TELL HERSELF THAT LET HER MOTHER SAY WHAT SHE WOULD SHE CERTAINLY NEVER WOULD STAND AT THE ALTAR WITH HER COUSIN MOUNTJOY EVEN NOW WHEN THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN DECLARED NOT TO BE HIS FATHER'S HEIR
7460-104483-0038 AND WHEN ALL THE WORLD KNEW THAT HE HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH MISSUS MOUNTJOY DID NOT ALTOGETHER GIVE HIM UP SHE PARTLY DISBELIEVED HER BROTHER AND PARTLY THOUGHT THAT CIRCUMSTANCES COULD NOT BE SO BAD AS THEY WERE DESCRIBED
7460-104483-0039 TO HER FEMININE MIND TO HER LIVING NOT IN THE WORLD OF LONDON BUT IN THE VERY MODERATE FASHION OF CHELTENHAM IT SEEMED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT AN ENTAIL SHOULD BE THUS BLIGHTED IN THE BUD
7460-104483-0040 WHY WAS AN ENTAIL CALLED AN ENTAIL UNLESS IT WERE INERADICABLE A DECISION OF FATE RATHER THAN OF MAN AND OF LAW AND TO HER EYES
7460-104483-0041 MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH WAS SO COMMANDING THAT ALL THINGS MUST AT LAST BE COMPELLED TO GO AS HE WOULD HAVE THEM AND TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE HAD LATELY COME TO MISSUS MOUNTJOY A WORD OF COMFORT WHICH MIGHT BE NECESSARY
7460-104483-0042 WITH THE WICKED SKILL OF HER BROTHER WHICH EVEN IN THAT CASE MIGHT MAKE CROOKED THINGS SMOOTH AUGUSTUS WHOM SHE HAD REGARDED ALWAYS AS QUITE A MOUNTJOY BECAUSE OF HIS TALENT AND APPEARANCE AND HABIT OF COMMAND HAD WHISPERED TO HER A WORD
7460-104483-0043 WHY SHOULD NOT FLORENCE BE TRANSFERRED WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE PROPERTY THERE WAS SOMETHING TO MISSUS MOUNTJOY'S FEELINGS BASE IN THE IDEA AT THE FIRST BLUSH OF IT SHE DID NOT LIKE TO BE UNTRUE TO HER GALLANT NEPHEW
7460-104483-0044 BUT AS SHE CAME TO TURN IT IN HER MIND THERE WERE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH RECOMMENDED THE CHANGE TO HER SHOULD THE CHANGE BE NECESSARY FLORENCE CERTAINLY HAD EXPRESSED AN UNINTELLIGIBLE OBJECTION TO THE ELDER BROTHER
7460-104483-0045 WHY SHOULD THE YOUNGER NOT BE MORE SUCCESSFUL MISSUS MOUNTJOY'S HEART HAD BEGUN TO DROOP WITHIN HER
7460-104483-0046 TO THE VOICE OF THE CHARMER ANOTHER CHARMER HAD COME MOST OBJECTIONABLE IN HER SIGHT BUT TO HIM NO WORD OF ABSOLUTE ENCOURAGEMENT HAD AS SHE THOUGHT BEEN YET SPOKEN
7460-104483-0047 AUGUSTUS HAD ALREADY OBTAINED FOR HIMSELF AMONG HIS FRIENDS THE CHARACTER OF AN ELOQUENT YOUNG LAWYER LET HIM COME AND TRY HIS ELOQUENCE ON HIS COUSIN ONLY LET IT FIRST BE ASCERTAINED AS AN ASSURED FACT AND BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL RETROGRESSION
7460-104483-0048 THAT THE SQUIRE'S VILLAINY WAS CERTAIN I THINK MY LOVE SHE SAID TO HER DAUGHTER ONE DAY THAT UNDER THE IMMEDIATE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FAMILY WE SHOULD RETIRE FOR A WHILE INTO PRIVATE LIFE
