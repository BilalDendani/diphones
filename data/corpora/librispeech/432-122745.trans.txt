432-122745-0000 FAIR GREEN VALLEYS LYING SPREAD OUT BELOW WITH STREAMS WINDING THROUGH THEM AND ISLAND GROVES OF TREES HERE AND THERE AND HUGE LONELY OAKS SCATTERED ABOUT AND CASTING BLACK BLOTS OF SHADE
432-122745-0001 WE CROSSED BROAD NATURAL LAWNS SPARKLING WITH DEW AND WE MOVED LIKE SPIRITS THE CUSHIONED TURF GIVING OUT NO SOUND OF FOOTFALL WE DREAMED ALONG THROUGH GLADES IN A
432-122745-0002 MIST OF GREEN LIGHT THAT GOT ITS TINT FROM THE SUN DRENCHED ROOF OF LEAVES OVERHEAD
432-122745-0003 CLEAREST AND COLDEST OF RUNLETS WENT FRISKING AND GOSSIPING OVER ITS REEFS AND MAKING A SORT OF WHISPERING MUSIC COMFORTABLE TO HEAR AND AT TIMES WE LEFT THE WORLD BEHIND AND ENTERED INTO THE SOLEMN GREAT DEEPS AND
432-122745-0004 RICH GLOOM OF THE FOREST WHERE
432-122745-0005 BEFORE YOU COULD EVEN GET YOUR EYE ON THE PLACE WHERE THE NOISE WAS AND WHERE ONLY THE EARLIEST BIRDS WERE TURNING OUT AND GETTING TO BUSINESS WITH A SONG HERE AND A QUARREL YONDER AND A MYSTERIOUS
432-122745-0006 FAR OFF HAMMERING AND DRUMMING FOR WORMS ON A TREE TRUNK AWAY SOMEWHERE IN THE IMPENETRABLE REMOTENESSES OF THE WOODS AND BY AND BY OUT WE WOULD SWING AGAIN INTO THE GLARE ABOUT THE THIRD OR
432-122745-0007 FOURTH OR FIFTH TIME THAT WE SWUNG OUT INTO THE GLARE IT WAS ALONG THERE SOMEWHERE A COUPLE OF HOURS OR SO AFTER SUN UP IT WASN'T AS PLEASANT AS IT HAD BEEN IT WAS BEGINNING TO GET HOT THIS WAS QUITE NOTICEABLE
432-122745-0008 DIDN'T MIND AT ALL AT FIRST I BEGAN TO MIND NOW AND MORE AND MORE TOO ALL THE TIME THE FIRST TEN OR FIFTEEN TIMES I WANTED MY HANDKERCHIEF I DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE I GOT ALONG AND
432-122745-0009 HANG A MAN THAT WOULD MAKE A SUIT OF ARMOR WITHOUT ANY POCKETS IN IT YOU SEE I HAD MY HANDKERCHIEF IN MY HELMET AND SOME OTHER THINGS
432-122745-0010 THAT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME WHEN I PUT IT THERE AND IN FACT I DIDN'T KNOW IT I SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY CONVENIENT THERE AND SO NOW THE THOUGHT OF ITS BEING THERE SO HANDY AND CLOSE BY AND YET
432-122745-0011 EVERY ONE HAS NOTICED THAT WELL IT TOOK MY MIND OFF FROM EVERYTHING ELSE TOOK IT CLEAR OFF AND CENTERED IT IN MY HELMET AND MILE AFTER MILE THERE IT STAYED
432-122745-0012 IMAGINING THE HANDKERCHIEF PICTURING THE HANDKERCHIEF AND IT WAS BITTER AND AGGRAVATING TO HAVE THE SALT SWEAT KEEP TRICKLING DOWN INTO MY EYES AND I COULDN'T GET AT IT IT SEEMS LIKE A LITTLE THING ON PAPER
432-122745-0013 BUT IT WAS NOT A LITTLE THING AT ALL IT WAS THE MOST REAL KIND OF MISERY I WOULD NOT SAY IT IF IT WAS NOT SO I MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WOULD CARRY ALONG A RETICULE NEXT TIME LET IT LOOK HOW IT MIGHT
432-122745-0014 AND PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY WOULD OF COURSE THESE IRON DUDES OF THE ROUND TABLE WOULD THINK IT WAS SCANDALOUS AND MAYBE RAISE SHEOL ABOUT IT BUT AS FOR ME GIVE ME COMFORT FIRST AND STYLE AFTERWARDS
432-122745-0015 I DON'T DENY THAT I AM NOT BETTER THAN OTHERS WE COULDN'T SEEM TO MEET ANYBODY IN THIS LONESOME BRITAIN NOT EVEN AN OGRE AND IN THE MOOD I WAS IN THEN IT WAS WELL FOR THE OGRE THAT IS AN OGRE WITH A HANDKERCHIEF
432-122745-0016 BUT SO I GOT HIS BANDANNA HE COULD KEEP HIS HARDWARE FOR ALL OF ME MEANTIME
432-122745-0017 YOU SEE THE SUN WAS BEATING DOWN AND WARMING UP THE IRON MORE AND MORE ALL THE TIME WELL WHEN YOU ARE HOT THAT WAY EVERY LITTLE THING IRRITATES YOU WHEN I TROTTED I RATTLED LIKE A CRATE OF DISHES AND THAT ANNOYED ME
432-122745-0018 AND MOREOVER I COULDN'T SEEM TO STAND THAT SHIELD SLATTING AND BANGING NOW ABOUT MY BREAST
432-122745-0019 IF I DROPPED INTO A WALK MY JOINTS CREAKED AND SCREECHED IN THAT WEARISOME WAY THAT A WHEELBARROW DOES AND AS WE DIDN'T CREATE ANY BREEZE AT THAT GAIT I WAS LIKE TO GET FRIED IN THAT STOVE AND BESIDES THE QUIETER YOU WENT
432-122745-0020 THE HEAVIER THE IRON SETTLED DOWN ON YOU
432-122745-0021 AND YOU HAD TO BE ALWAYS CHANGING HANDS AND PASSING YOUR SPEAR OVER TO THE OTHER FOOT IT GOT SO IRKSOME FOR ONE HAND TO HOLD IT LONG AT A TIME WELL
432-122745-0022 YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PERSPIRE THAT WAY IN RIVERS THERE COMES A TIME WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WELL WHEN YOU ITCH YOU ARE INSIDE YOUR HANDS ARE OUTSIDE
432-122745-0023 SO THERE YOU ARE NOTHING BUT IRON BETWEEN IT IS NOT A LIGHT THING LET IT SOUND AS IT MAY FIRST IT IS ONE PLACE THEN ANOTHER THEN SOME MORE
432-122745-0024 AND IT GOES ON SPREADING AND SPREADING AND AT LAST THE TERRITORY IS ALL OCCUPIED AND NOBODY CAN IMAGINE WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE NOR HOW UNPLEASANT IT IS AND WHEN IT HAD GOT TO THE WORST AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I COULD NOT STAND ANYTHING MORE
432-122745-0025 A FLY GOT IN THROUGH THE BARS AND SETTLED ON MY NOSE AND THE BARS WERE STUCK AND WOULDN'T WORK AND I COULDN'T GET THE VISOR UP AND I COULD ONLY SHAKE MY HEAD WHICH WAS
432-122745-0026 SO I GAVE IN
432-122745-0027 AND RELIEVE ME OF IT THEN SHE EMPTIED THE CONVENIENCES OUT OF IT AND FETCHED IT FULL OF WATER AND I DRANK AND THEN STOOD UP AND SHE POURED THE REST DOWN INSIDE THE ARMOR ONE CANNOT THINK HOW REFRESHING IT WAS
432-122745-0028 SHE CONTINUED TO FETCH AND POUR UNTIL I WAS WELL SOAKED AND THOROUGHLY COMFORTABLE IT WAS GOOD TO HAVE A REST AND PEACE
432-122745-0029 BUT NOTHING IS QUITE PERFECT IN THIS LIFE AT ANY TIME I HAD MADE A PIPE A WHILE BACK AND ALSO SOME PRETTY FAIR TOBACCO NOT THE REAL THING BUT WHAT SOME OF THE INDIANS USE THE INSIDE BARK OF THE WILLOW
432-122745-0030 THAT WE WERE WEATHER BOUND AN ARMED NOVICE CANNOT MOUNT HIS HORSE WITHOUT HELP AND PLENTY OF IT SANDY WAS NOT ENOUGH NOT ENOUGH FOR ME ANYWAY WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEBODY SHOULD COME ALONG
432-122745-0031 WAITING IN SILENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN AGREEABLE ENOUGH FOR I WAS FULL OF MATTER FOR REFLECTION AND WANTED TO GIVE IT A CHANCE TO WORK I WANTED TO TRY AND THINK OUT HOW IT WAS THAT RATIONAL OR EVEN HALF RATIONAL MEN
432-122745-0032 CONSIDERING ITS INCONVENIENCES AND HOW THEY HAD MANAGED TO KEEP UP SUCH A FASHION FOR GENERATIONS WHEN IT WAS PLAIN THAT WHAT I HAD SUFFERED TO DAY THEY HAD HAD TO SUFFER ALL THE DAYS OF THEIR LIVES
432-122745-0033 I WANTED TO THINK THAT OUT AND MOREOVER I WANTED TO THINK OUT SOME WAY TO REFORM THIS EVIL AND PERSUADE THE PEOPLE TO LET THE FOOLISH FASHION DIE OUT BUT THINKING WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES
432-122745-0034 YOU COULDN'T THINK WHERE SANDY WAS SHE WAS A QUITE BIDDABLE CREATURE AND GOOD HEARTED BUT SHE HAD A FLOW OF TALK THAT WAS AS STEADY AS A MILL AND MADE YOUR HEAD SORE LIKE THE DRAYS AND WAGONS IN A CITY
432-122745-0035 BUT YOU CAN'T CORK THAT KIND THEY WOULD DIE HER CLACK WAS GOING ALL DAY AND YOU WOULD THINK SOMETHING WOULD SURELY HAPPEN TO HER WORKS BY AND BY BUT NO THEY NEVER GOT OUT OF ORDER AND SHE NEVER HAD TO SLACK UP FOR WORDS
432-122745-0036 ANY MORE THAN A FOG HAS SHE WAS A PERFECT BLATHERSKITE I MEAN FOR JAW JAW JAW TALK TALK TALK JABBER JABBER JABBER BUT JUST AS GOOD AS SHE COULD BE
