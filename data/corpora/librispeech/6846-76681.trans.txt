6846-76681-0000 MY LAST SPECIAL FEAT WAS TURNING OUT OF BED AT TWO AFTER A HARD DAY
6846-76681-0001 AND WALKING THIRTY MILES INTO THE COUNTRY TO BREAKFAST THE ROAD WAS SO LONELY IN THE NIGHT THAT I FELL ASLEEP TO THE MONOTONOUS SOUND OF MY OWN FEET DOING THEIR REGULAR FOUR MILES AN HOUR MILE AFTER MILE I WALKED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SENSE OF EXERTION
6846-76681-0002 DOZING HEAVILY AND DREAMING CONSTANTLY IT WAS ONLY WHEN I MADE A STUMBLE LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN OR STRUCK OUT INTO THE ROAD TO AVOID A HORSEMAN CLOSE UPON ME ON THE PATH WHO HAD NO EXISTENCE THAT I CAME TO MYSELF AND LOOKED ABOUT THE DAY BROKE MISTILY
6846-76681-0003 IT WAS AUTUMN TIME AND I COULD NOT DISEMBARRASS MYSELF OF THE IDEA THAT I HAD TO CLIMB THOSE HEIGHTS AND BANKS OF CLOUD AND THAT THERE WAS AN ALPINE CONVENT SOMEWHERE BEHIND THE SUN WHERE I WAS GOING TO BREAKFAST
6846-76681-0004 THIS SLEEPY NOTION WAS SO MUCH STRONGER THAN SUCH SUBSTANTIAL OBJECTS AS VILLAGES AND HAYSTACKS THAT AFTER THE SUN WAS UP AND BRIGHT
6846-76681-0005 I STILL OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT MYSELF LOOKING ABOUT FOR WOODEN ARMS TO POINT THE RIGHT TRACK UP THE MOUNTAIN
6846-76681-0006 IT IS A CURIOSITY OF BROKEN SLEEP THAT I MADE IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF VERSES ON THAT PEDESTRIAN OCCASION OF COURSE I NEVER MAKE ANY WHEN I AM IN MY RIGHT SENSES AND THAT I SPOKE A CERTAIN LANGUAGE ONCE PRETTY FAMILIAR TO ME BUT WHICH I HAVE NEARLY FORGOTTEN FROM DISUSE WITH FLUENCY
6846-76681-0007 THAT I SOMETIMES ARGUE WITH MYSELF THAT I KNOW I CANNOT BE AWAKE FOR IF I WERE I SHOULD NOT BE HALF SO READY THE READINESS IS NOT IMAGINARY BECAUSE I OFTEN RECALL LONG STRINGS OF THE VERSES AND MANY TURNS OF THE FLUENT SPEECH AFTER I AM BROAD AWAKE
6846-76681-0008 MY WALKING IS OF TWO KINDS ONE STRAIGHT ON END TO A DEFINITE GOAL AT A ROUND PACE ONE OBJECTLESS LOITERING AND PURELY VAGABOND IN THE LATTER STATE NO GIPSY ON EARTH IS A GREATER VAGABOND THAN MYSELF
6846-76681-0009 IT IS SO NATURAL TO ME AND STRONG WITH ME THAT I THINK I MUST BE THE DESCENDANT AT NO GREAT DISTANCE OF SOME IRRECLAIMABLE TRAMP ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST THINGS I HAVE LATELY MET WITH IN A VAGABOND COURSE OF SHY METROPOLITAN NEIGHBOURHOODS AND SMALL SHOPS
6846-76681-0010 IS THE FANCY OF A HUMBLE ARTIST AS EXEMPLIFIED IN TWO PORTRAITS REPRESENTING MISTER THOMAS SAYERS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND MISTER JOHN HEENAN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THESE ILLUSTRIOUS MEN ARE HIGHLY COLOURED IN FIGHTING TRIM AND FIGHTING ATTITUDE
6846-76681-0011 TO SUGGEST THE PASTORAL AND MEDITATIVE NATURE OF THEIR PEACEFUL CALLING MISTER HEENAN IS REPRESENTED ON EMERALD SWARD WITH PRIMROSES AND OTHER MODEST FLOWERS SPRINGING UP UNDER THE HEELS OF HIS HALF BOOTS WHILE MISTER SAYERS IS IMPELLED TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HIS FAVOURITE BLOW THE AUCTIONEER
6846-76681-0012 BY THE SILENT ELOQUENCE OF A VILLAGE CHURCH THE HUMBLE HOMES OF ENGLAND WITH THEIR DOMESTIC VIRTUES AND HONEYSUCKLE PORCHES URGE BOTH HEROES TO GO IN AND WIN AND THE LARK AND OTHER SINGING BIRDS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE UPPER AIR ECSTATICALLY CAROLLING THEIR THANKS TO HEAVEN FOR A FIGHT
6846-76681-0013 FOR HUMAN NOTES WE MAY RETURN TO SUCH NEIGHBOURHOODS WHEN LEISURE AND OPPORTUNITY SERVE NOTHING IN SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS PERPLEXES MY MIND MORE THAN THE BAD COMPANY BIRDS KEEP FOREIGN BIRDS OFTEN GET INTO GOOD SOCIETY BUT BRITISH BIRDS ARE INSEPARABLE FROM LOW ASSOCIATES
6846-76681-0014 THEY SEEM TO LEAD PEOPLE INTO DRINKING AND EVEN THE MAN WHO MAKES THEIR CAGES USUALLY GETS INTO A CHRONIC STATE OF BLACK EYE WHY IS THIS ALSO THEY WILL DO THINGS FOR PEOPLE IN SHORT SKIRTED VELVETEEN COATS WITH BONE BUTTONS
6846-76681-0015 OR IN SLEEVED WAISTCOATS AND FUR CAPS WHICH THEY CANNOT BE PERSUADED BY THE RESPECTABLE ORDERS OF SOCIETY TO UNDERTAKE IN A DIRTY COURT IN SPITALFIELDS ONCE I FOUND A GOLDFINCH DRAWING HIS OWN WATER
6846-76681-0016 AND DRAWING AS MUCH OF IT AS IF HE WERE IN A CONSUMING FEVER THAT GOLDFINCH LIVED AT A BIRD SHOP AND OFFERED IN WRITING TO BARTER HIMSELF AGAINST OLD CLOTHES EMPTY BOTTLES OR EVEN KITCHEN STUFF SURELY A LOW THING AND A DEPRAVED TASTE IN ANY FINCH
6846-76681-0017 I BOUGHT THAT GOLDFINCH FOR MONEY HE WAS SENT HOME AND HUNG UPON A NAIL OVER AGAINST MY TABLE HE LIVED OUTSIDE A COUNTERFEIT DWELLING HOUSE SUPPOSED AS I ARGUED TO BE A DYER'S
6846-76681-0018 OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS PERCH STICKING OUT OF THE GARRET WINDOW FROM THE TIME OF HIS APPEARANCE IN MY ROOM EITHER HE LEFT OFF BEING THIRSTY WHICH WAS NOT IN THE BOND OR HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO HEAR HIS LITTLE BUCKET DROP BACK INTO HIS WELL WHEN HE LET IT GO
6846-76681-0019 A SHOCK WHICH IN THE BEST OF TIMES HAD MADE HIM TREMBLE HE DREW NO WATER BUT BY STEALTH AND UNDER THE CLOAK OF NIGHT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF FUTILE AND AT LENGTH HOPELESS EXPECTATION THE MERCHANT WHO HAD EDUCATED HIM WAS APPEALED TO
6846-76681-0020 THE MERCHANT WAS A BOW LEGGED CHARACTER WITH A FLAT AND CUSHIONY NOSE LIKE THE LAST NEW STRAWBERRY HE WORE A FUR CAP AND SHORTS AND WAS OF THE VELVETEEN RACE VELVETEENY HE SENT WORD THAT HE WOULD LOOK ROUND
6846-76681-0021 APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY OF THE ROOM AND SLIGHTLY COCKED UP HIS EVIL EYE AT THE GOLDFINCH INSTANTLY A RAGING THIRST BESET THAT BIRD WHEN IT WAS APPEASED HE STILL DREW SEVERAL UNNECESSARY BUCKETS OF WATER AND FINALLY LEAPED ABOUT HIS PERCH AND SHARPENED HIS BILL
6846-76681-0022 AS IF HE HAD BEEN TO THE NEAREST WINE VAULTS AND GOT DRUNK DONKEYS AGAIN I KNOW SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS WHERE THE DONKEY GOES IN AT THE STREET DOOR AND APPEARS TO LIVE UP STAIRS FOR I HAVE EXAMINED THE BACK YARD FROM OVER THE PALINGS AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE HIM OUT
6846-76681-0023 GENTILITY NOBILITY ROYALTY WOULD APPEAL TO THAT DONKEY IN VAIN TO DO WHAT HE DOES FOR A COSTERMONGER FEED HIM WITH OATS AT THE HIGHEST PRICE PUT AN INFANT PRINCE AND PRINCESS IN A PAIR OF PANNIERS ON HIS BACK ADJUST HIS DELICATE TRAPPINGS TO A NICETY
6846-76681-0024 TAKE HIM TO THE SOFTEST SLOPES AT WINDSOR AND TRY WHAT PACE YOU CAN GET OUT OF HIM THEN STARVE HIM HARNESS HIM ANYHOW TO A TRUCK WITH A FLAT TRAY ON IT AND SEE HIM BOWL FROM WHITECHAPEL TO BAYSWATER
6846-76681-0025 THERE APPEARS TO BE NO PARTICULAR PRIVATE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN BIRDS AND DONKEYS IN A STATE OF NATURE BUT IN THE SHY NEIGHBOURHOOD STATE YOU SHALL SEE THEM ALWAYS IN THE SAME HANDS AND ALWAYS DEVELOPING THEIR VERY BEST ENERGIES FOR THE VERY WORST COMPANY
6846-76681-0026 I HAVE KNOWN A DONKEY BY SIGHT WE WERE NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS WHO LIVED OVER ON THE SURREY SIDE OF LONDON BRIDGE AMONG THE FASTNESSES OF JACOB'S ISLAND AND DOCKHEAD IT WAS THE HABIT OF THAT ANIMAL WHEN HIS SERVICES WERE NOT IN IMMEDIATE REQUISITION
6846-76681-0027 TO GO OUT ALONE IDLING I HAVE MET HIM A MILE FROM HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE LOITERING ABOUT THE STREETS AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS COUNTENANCE AT SUCH TIMES WAS MOST DEGRADED
6846-76681-0028 AND HE USED TO STAND ON SATURDAY NIGHTS WITH A CARTFUL OF THOSE DELICACIES OUTSIDE A GIN SHOP PRICKING UP HIS EARS WHEN A CUSTOMER CAME TO THE CART AND TOO EVIDENTLY DERIVING SATISFACTION FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY GOT BAD MEASURE HIS MISTRESS WAS SOMETIMES OVERTAKEN BY INEBRIETY
6846-76681-0029 THE LAST TIME I EVER SAW HIM ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO HE WAS IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF DIFFICULTY CAUSED BY THIS FAILING HAVING BEEN LEFT ALONE WITH THE CART OF PERIWINKLES AND FORGOTTEN HE WENT OFF IDLING
6846-76681-0030 HE PROWLED AMONG HIS USUAL LOW HAUNTS FOR SOME TIME GRATIFYING HIS DEPRAVED TASTES UNTIL NOT TAKING THE CART INTO HIS CALCULATIONS HE ENDEAVOURED TO TURN UP A NARROW ALLEY AND BECAME GREATLY INVOLVED
6846-76681-0031 HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY THE POLICE AND THE GREEN YARD OF THE DISTRICT BEING NEAR AT HAND WAS BACKED INTO THAT PLACE OF DURANCE AT THAT CRISIS I ENCOUNTERED HIM THE STUBBORN SENSE HE EVINCED OF BEING NOT TO COMPROMISE THE EXPRESSION
6846-76681-0032 A BLACKGUARD I NEVER SAW EXCEEDED IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT A FLARING CANDLE IN A PAPER SHADE STUCK IN AMONG HIS PERIWINKLES SHOWED HIM WITH HIS RAGGED HARNESS BROKEN AND HIS CART EXTENSIVELY SHATTERED TWITCHING HIS MOUTH AND SHAKING HIS HANGING HEAD A PICTURE OF DISGRACE AND OBDURACY
6846-76681-0033 I HAVE SEEN BOYS BEING TAKEN TO STATION HOUSES WHO WERE AS LIKE HIM AS HIS OWN BROTHER THE DOGS OF SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS I OBSERVE TO AVOID PLAY AND TO BE CONSCIOUS OF POVERTY THEY AVOID WORK TOO IF THEY CAN OF COURSE THAT IS IN THE NATURE OF ALL ANIMALS
6846-76681-0034 WHO HAS GREATLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF IN THE MINOR DRAMA AND WHO TAKES HIS PORTRAIT WITH HIM WHEN HE MAKES AN ENGAGEMENT FOR THE ILLUSTRATION OF THE PLAY BILL
6846-76681-0035 OR ESSAYED TO TOMAHAWK A BRITISH OFFICER
6846-76681-0036 AND NO SUCH INCIDENT HE IS A DOG OF THE NEWFOUNDLAND BREED FOR WHOSE HONESTY I WOULD BE BAIL TO ANY AMOUNT BUT WHOSE INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES IN ASSOCIATION WITH DRAMATIC FICTION I CANNOT RATE HIGH INDEED HE IS TOO HONEST FOR THE PROFESSION HE HAS ENTERED
6846-76681-0037 AND SEEING HIM POSTED IN THE BILL OF THE NIGHT I ATTENDED THE PERFORMANCE HIS FIRST SCENE WAS EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL BUT AS IT OCCUPIED A SECOND IN ITS REPRESENTATION AND FIVE LINES IN THE BILL IT SCARCELY AFFORDED GROUND FOR A COOL AND DELIBERATE JUDGMENT OF HIS POWERS
6846-76681-0038 HE HAD MERELY TO BARK RUN ON AND JUMP THROUGH AN INN WINDOW AFTER A COMIC FUGITIVE THE NEXT SCENE OF IMPORTANCE TO THE FABLE WAS A LITTLE MARRED IN ITS INTEREST BY HIS OVER ANXIETY FORASMUCH AS WHILE HIS MASTER A BELATED SOLDIER IN A DEN OF ROBBERS ON A TEMPESTUOUS NIGHT
6846-76681-0039 AND LAYING GREAT STRESS ON THE FACT THAT HE WAS THIRTY LEAGUES AWAY THE FAITHFUL DOG WAS BARKING FURIOUSLY IN THE PROMPTER'S BOX AND CLEARLY CHOKING HIMSELF AGAINST HIS COLLAR BUT IT WAS IN HIS GREATEST SCENE OF ALL THAT HIS HONESTY GOT THE BETTER OF HIM HE HAD TO ENTER A DENSE AND TRACKLESS FOREST
6846-76681-0040 ON THE TRAIL OF THE MURDERER AND THERE TO FLY AT THE MURDERER WHEN HE FOUND HIM RESTING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE WITH HIS VICTIM BOUND READY FOR SLAUGHTER IT WAS A HOT NIGHT AND HE CAME INTO THE FOREST FROM AN ALTOGETHER UNEXPECTED DIRECTION IN THE SWEETEST TEMPER
6846-76681-0041 AT A VERY DELIBERATE TROT NOT IN THE LEAST EXCITED TROTTED TO THE FOOT LIGHTS WITH HIS TONGUE OUT AND THERE SAT DOWN PANTING AND AMIABLY SURVEYING THE AUDIENCE WITH HIS TAIL BEATING ON THE BOARDS LIKE A DUTCH CLOCK MEANWHILE THE MURDERER
6846-76681-0042 ASSAILED HIM WITH THE MOST INJURIOUS EXPRESSIONS IT HAPPENED THROUGH THESE MEANS THAT WHEN HE WAS IN COURSE OF TIME PERSUADED TO TROT UP AND REND THE MURDERER LIMB FROM LIMB HE MADE IT FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES
6846-76681-0043 A LITTLE TOO OBVIOUS THAT HE WORKED OUT THAT AWFUL RETRIBUTION BY LICKING BUTTER OFF HIS BLOOD STAINED HANDS IN A SHY STREET BEHIND LONG ACRE TWO HONEST DOGS LIVE WHO PERFORM IN PUNCH'S SHOWS I MAY VENTURE TO SAY THAT I AM ON TERMS OF INTIMACY WITH BOTH
6846-76681-0044 AND THAT I NEVER SAW EITHER GUILTY OF THE FALSEHOOD OF FAILING TO LOOK DOWN AT THE MAN INSIDE THE SHOW DURING THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE
6846-76681-0045 FROM THIS COVENT GARDEN WINDOW OF MINE I NOTICED A COUNTRY DOG ONLY THE OTHER DAY WHO HAD COME UP TO COVENT GARDEN MARKET UNDER A CART AND HAD BROKEN HIS CORD AN END OF WHICH HE STILL TRAILED ALONG WITH HIM HE LOITERED ABOUT THE CORNERS OF THE FOUR STREETS COMMANDED BY MY WINDOW
6846-76681-0046 AND BAD LONDON DOGS CAME UP AND TOLD HIM LIES THAT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE AND WORSE LONDON DOGS CAME UP AND MADE PROPOSALS TO HIM TO GO AND STEAL IN THE MARKET WHICH HIS PRINCIPLES REJECTED
6846-76681-0047 AND HE CREPT ASIDE AND LAY DOWN IN A DOORWAY HE HAD SCARCELY GOT A WINK OF SLEEP WHEN UP COMES PUNCH WITH TOBY HE WAS DARTING TO TOBY FOR CONSOLATION AND ADVICE WHEN HE SAW THE FRILL AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET APPALLED
6846-76681-0048 THE SHOW WAS PITCHED TOBY RETIRED BEHIND THE DRAPERY THE AUDIENCE FORMED THE DRUM AND PIPES STRUCK UP MY COUNTRY DOG REMAINED IMMOVABLE INTENTLY STARING AT THESE STRANGE APPEARANCES UNTIL TOBY OPENED THE DRAMA BY APPEARING ON HIS LEDGE
6846-76681-0049 AND TO HIM ENTERED PUNCH WHO PUT A TOBACCO PIPE INTO TOBY'S MOUTH AT THIS SPECTACLE THE COUNTRY DOG THREW UP HIS HEAD GAVE ONE TERRIBLE HOWL AND FLED DUE WEST WE TALK OF MEN KEEPING DOGS
6846-76681-0050 BUT WE MIGHT OFTEN TALK MORE EXPRESSIVELY OF DOGS KEEPING MEN I KNOW A BULL DOG IN A SHY CORNER OF HAMMERSMITH WHO KEEPS A MAN HE KEEPS HIM UP A YARD AND MAKES HIM GO TO PUBLIC HOUSES AND LAY WAGERS ON HIM AND OBLIGES HIM TO LEAN AGAINST POSTS AND LOOK AT HIM
6846-76681-0051 AND FORCES HIM TO NEGLECT WORK FOR HIM AND KEEPS HIM UNDER RIGID COERCION I ONCE KNEW A FANCY TERRIER WHO KEPT A GENTLEMAN
6846-76681-0052 THE DOG KEPT THE GENTLEMAN ENTIRELY FOR HIS GLORIFICATION
6846-76681-0053 THIS HOWEVER WAS NOT IN A SHY NEIGHBOURHOOD
6846-76681-0054 THERE ARE A GREAT MANY DOGS IN SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS WHO KEEP BOYS I HAVE MY EYE ON A MONGREL IN SOMERSTOWN WHO KEEPS THREE BOYS HE FEIGNS THAT HE CAN BRING DOWN SPARROWS AND UNBURROW RATS HE CAN DO NEITHER
6846-76681-0055 AND HE TAKES THE BOYS OUT ON SPORTING PRETENCES INTO ALL SORTS OF SUBURBAN FIELDS HE HAS LIKEWISE MADE THEM BELIEVE THAT HE POSSESSES SOME MYSTERIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE ART OF FISHING AND THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES INCOMPLETELY EQUIPPED FOR THE HAMPSTEAD PONDS WITH A PICKLE JAR AND WIDE MOUTHED BOTTLE
6846-76681-0056 UNLESS HE IS WITH THEM AND BARKING TREMENDOUSLY
6846-76681-0057 HE MAY BE SEEN MOST DAYS IN OXFORD STREET
6846-76681-0058 AND UNINTELLIGIBLE TO THE MAN WHOLLY OF THE DOG'S CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION CONTRARIWISE WHEN THE MAN HAS PROJECTS
6846-76681-0059 APPARENTLY TO VISIT A DOG AT HARROW HE WAS SO INTENT ON THAT DIRECTION THE NORTH WALL OF BURLINGTON HOUSE GARDENS BETWEEN THE ARCADE AND THE ALBANY OFFERS A SHY SPOT FOR APPOINTMENTS AMONG BLIND MEN AT ABOUT TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THEY SIT VERY UNCOMFORTABLY
6846-76681-0060 ON A SLOPING STONE THERE AND COMPARE NOTES THEIR DOGS MAY ALWAYS BE OBSERVED AT THE SAME TIME OPENLY DISPARAGING THE MEN THEY KEEP TO ONE ANOTHER AND SETTLING WHERE THEY SHALL RESPECTIVELY TAKE THEIR MEN WHEN THEY BEGIN TO MOVE AGAIN AT A SMALL BUTCHER'S IN A SHY NEIGHBOURHOOD
6846-76681-0061 THERE IS NO REASON FOR SUPPRESSING THE NAME IT IS BY NOTTING HILL AND GIVES UPON THE DISTRICT CALLED THE POTTERIES I KNOW A SHAGGY BLACK AND WHITE DOG WHO KEEPS A DROVER HE IS A DOG OF AN EASY DISPOSITION AND TOO FREQUENTLY ALLOWS THIS DROVER TO GET DRUNK
6846-76681-0062 ON THESE OCCASIONS IT IS THE DOG'S CUSTOM TO SIT OUTSIDE THE PUBLIC HOUSE KEEPING HIS EYE ON A FEW SHEEP AND THINKING I HAVE SEEN HIM WITH SIX SHEEP PLAINLY CASTING UP IN HIS MIND HOW MANY HE BEGAN WITH WHEN HE LEFT THE MARKET AND AT WHAT PLACES HE HAS LEFT THE REST
6846-76681-0063 A LIGHT HAS GRADUALLY BROKEN ON HIM HE HAS REMEMBERED AT WHAT BUTCHER'S HE LEFT THEM AND IN A BURST OF GRAVE SATISFACTION HAS CAUGHT A FLY OFF HIS NOSE AND SHOWN HIMSELF MUCH RELIEVED IF I COULD AT ANY TIME HAVE DOUBTED THE FACT THAT IT WAS HE WHO KEPT THE DROVER
6846-76681-0064 AND NOT THE DROVER WHO KEPT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABUNDANTLY PROVED BY HIS WAY OF TAKING UNDIVIDED CHARGE OF THE SIX SHEEP WHEN THE DROVER CAME OUT BESMEARED WITH RED OCHRE AND BEER AND GAVE HIM WRONG DIRECTIONS WHICH HE CALMLY DISREGARDED
6846-76681-0065 HE HAS TAKEN THE SHEEP ENTIRELY INTO HIS OWN HANDS HAS MERELY REMARKED WITH RESPECTFUL FIRMNESS THAT INSTRUCTION WOULD PLACE THEM UNDER AN OMNIBUS YOU HAD BETTER CONFINE YOUR ATTENTION TO YOURSELF YOU WILL WANT IT ALL AND HAS DRIVEN HIS CHARGE AWAY WITH AN INTELLIGENCE OF EARS AND TAIL
6846-76681-0066 AND A KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS THAT HAS LEFT HIS LOUT OF A MAN VERY VERY FAR BEHIND AS THE DOGS OF SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS USUALLY BETRAY A SLINKING CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING IN POOR CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE MOST PART MANIFESTED IN AN ASPECT OF ANXIETY AN AWKWARDNESS IN THEIR PLAY
6846-76681-0067 AND A MISGIVING THAT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO HARNESS THEM TO SOMETHING TO PICK UP A LIVING SO THE CATS OF SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS EXHIBIT A STRONG TENDENCY TO RELAPSE INTO BARBARISM NOT ONLY ARE THEY MADE SELFISHLY FEROCIOUS BY RUMINATING ON THE SURPLUS POPULATION AROUND THEM
6846-76681-0068 AND ON THE DENSELY CROWDED STATE OF ALL THE AVENUES TO CAT'S MEAT NOT ONLY IS THERE A MORAL AND POLITICO ECONOMICAL HAGGARDNESS IN THEM TRACEABLE TO THESE REFLECTIONS BUT THEY EVINCE A PHYSICAL DETERIORATION
6846-76681-0069 AND ALSO IN THE BACK SETTLEMENTS OF DRURY LANE IN APPEARANCE THEY ARE VERY LIKE THE WOMEN AMONG WHOM THEY LIVE THEY SEEM TO TURN OUT OF THEIR UNWHOLESOME BEDS INTO THE STREET WITHOUT ANY PREPARATION THEY LEAVE THEIR YOUNG FAMILIES TO STAGGER ABOUT THE GUTTERS
6846-76681-0070 IN PARTICULAR I REMARK THAT WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT TO INCREASE THEIR FAMILIES AN EVENT OF FREQUENT RECURRENCE THE RESEMBLANCE IS STRONGLY EXPRESSED IN A CERTAIN DUSTY DOWDINESS DOWN AT HEEL SELF NEGLECT AND GENERAL GIVING UP OF THINGS
6846-76681-0071 I CANNOT HONESTLY REPORT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN A FELINE MATRON OF THIS CLASS WASHING HER FACE WHEN IN AN INTERESTING CONDITION NOT TO PROLONG THESE NOTES OF UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVEL AMONG THE LOWER ANIMALS OF SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS BY DWELLING AT LENGTH UPON THE EXASPERATED MOODINESS OF THE TOM CATS
6846-76681-0072 I WILL COME TO A CLOSE WITH A WORD ON THE FOWLS OF THE SAME LOCALITIES THAT ANYTHING BORN OF AN EGG AND INVESTED WITH WINGS SHOULD HAVE GOT TO THE PASS THAT IT HOPS CONTENTEDLY DOWN A LADDER INTO A CELLAR AND CALLS THAT GOING HOME
6846-76681-0073 IS A CIRCUMSTANCE SO AMAZING AS TO LEAVE ONE NOTHING MORE IN THIS CONNEXION TO WONDER AT
6846-76681-0074 HAVE TAKEN TO GROVELLING IN BRICKS AND MORTAR AND MUD HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT LIVE TREES AND MAKE ROOSTING PLACES OF SHOP BOARDS BARROWS OYSTER TUBS BULK HEADS AND DOOR SCRAPERS I WONDER AT NOTHING CONCERNING THEM AND TAKE THEM AS THEY ARE
6846-76681-0075 I ACCEPT AS PRODUCTS OF NATURE AND THINGS OF COURSE A REDUCED BANTAM FAMILY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE HACKNEY ROAD WHO ARE INCESSANTLY AT THE PAWNBROKER'S I CANNOT SAY THAT THEY ENJOY THEMSELVES FOR THEY ARE OF A MELANCHOLY TEMPERAMENT BUT WHAT ENJOYMENT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF
6846-76681-0076 THEY DERIVE FROM CROWDING TOGETHER IN THE PAWNBROKER'S SIDE ENTRY HERE THEY ARE ALWAYS TO BE FOUND IN A FEEBLE FLUTTER AS IF THEY WERE NEWLY COME DOWN IN THE WORLD AND WERE AFRAID OF BEING IDENTIFIED I KNOW A LOW FELLOW ORIGINALLY OF A GOOD FAMILY FROM DORKING
6846-76681-0077 WHO TAKES HIS WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT OF WIVES IN SINGLE FILE
6846-76681-0078 EMERGES WITH THEM AT THE BOTTLE ENTRANCE AND SO PASSES HIS LIFE SELDOM IN THE SEASON GOING TO BED BEFORE TWO IN THE MORNING OVER WATERLOO BRIDGE THERE IS A SHABBY OLD SPECKLED COUPLE THEY BELONG TO THE WOODEN FRENCH BEDSTEAD WASHING STAND AND TOWEL HORSE MAKING TRADE
6846-76681-0079 HAS AN IDEA OF ENTRUSTING AN EGG TO THAT PARTICULAR DENOMINATION OR MERELY UNDERSTANDS THAT SHE HAS NO BUSINESS IN THE BUILDING AND IS CONSEQUENTLY FRANTIC TO ENTER IT I CANNOT DETERMINE BUT SHE IS CONSTANTLY ENDEAVOURING TO UNDERMINE THE PRINCIPAL DOOR WHILE HER PARTNER WHO IS INFIRM UPON HIS LEGS
6846-76681-0080 WALKS UP AND DOWN ENCOURAGING HER AND DEFYING THE UNIVERSE BUT THE FAMILY I HAVE BEEN BEST ACQUAINTED WITH
6846-76681-0081 RESIDE IN THE DENSEST PART OF BETHNAL GREEN THEIR ABSTRACTION FROM THE OBJECTS AMONG WHICH THEY LIVE OR RATHER THEIR CONVICTION THAT THOSE OBJECTS HAVE ALL COME INTO EXISTENCE IN EXPRESS SUBSERVIENCE TO FOWLS HAS SO ENCHANTED ME THAT I HAVE MADE THEM THE SUBJECT OF MANY JOURNEYS AT DIVERS HOURS
6846-76681-0082 AFTER CAREFUL OBSERVATION OF THE TWO LORDS AND THE TEN LADIES OF WHOM THIS FAMILY CONSISTS I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEIR OPINIONS ARE REPRESENTED BY THE LEADING LORD AND LEADING LADY THE LATTER AS I JUDGE AN AGED PERSONAGE
6846-76681-0083 AFFLICTED WITH A PAUCITY OF FEATHER AND VISIBILITY OF QUILL THAT GIVES HER THE APPEARANCE OF A BUNDLE OF OFFICE PENS WHEN A RAILWAY GOODS VAN THAT WOULD CRUSH AN ELEPHANT COMES ROUND THE CORNER TEARING OVER THESE FOWLS THEY EMERGE UNHARMED FROM UNDER THE HORSES
6846-76681-0084 PERFECTLY SATISFIED THAT THE WHOLE RUSH WAS A PASSING PROPERTY IN THE AIR WHICH MAY HAVE LEFT SOMETHING TO EAT BEHIND IT THEY LOOK UPON OLD SHOES WRECKS OF KETTLES AND SAUCEPANS AND FRAGMENTS OF BONNETS AS A KIND OF METEORIC DISCHARGE FOR FOWLS TO PECK AT
6846-76681-0085 PEG TOPS AND HOOPS THEY ACCOUNT I THINK AS A SORT OF HAIL SHUTTLECOCKS AS RAIN OR DEW GASLIGHT COMES QUITE AS NATURAL TO THEM AS ANY OTHER LIGHT AND I HAVE MORE THAN A SUSPICION THAT IN THE MINDS OF THE TWO LORDS
6846-76681-0086 I HAVE ESTABLISHED IT AS A CERTAIN FACT THAT THEY ALWAYS BEGIN TO CROW WHEN THE PUBLIC HOUSE SHUTTERS BEGIN TO BE TAKEN DOWN
