1985-144468-0000 I AM DOUBTFUL WHETHER I WAS AT HEART GLAD OR SORRY WHEN MY SCHOOL DAYS DREW TO AN END AND THE TIME CAME FOR MY LEAVING DOCTOR STRONG'S
1985-144468-0001 I HAD A GREAT ATTACHMENT FOR THE DOCTOR AND I WAS EMINENT AND DISTINGUISHED IN THAT LITTLE WORLD FOR THESE REASONS I WAS SORRY TO GO BUT FOR OTHER REASONS UNSUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH I WAS GLAD MISTY IDEAS OF BEING A YOUNG MAN AT MY OWN DISPOSAL
1985-144468-0002 OF THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHING TO A YOUNG MAN AT HIS OWN DISPOSAL OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS TO BE SEEN AND DONE BY THAT MAGNIFICENT ANIMAL AND THE WONDERFUL EFFECTS HE COULD NOT FAIL TO MAKE UPON SOCIETY LURED ME AWAY
1985-144468-0003 SO POWERFUL WERE THESE VISIONARY CONSIDERATIONS IN MY BOYISH MIND THAT I SEEM ACCORDING TO MY PRESENT WAY OF THINKING
1985-144468-0004 THE SEPARATION HAS NOT MADE THE IMPRESSION ON ME THAT OTHER SEPARATIONS HAVE I TRY IN VAIN TO RECALL HOW I FELT ABOUT IT AND WHAT ITS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE BUT IT IS NOT MOMENTOUS IN MY RECOLLECTION I SUPPOSE THE OPENING PROSPECT CONFUSED ME
1985-144468-0005 I KNOW THAT MY JUVENILE EXPERIENCES WENT FOR LITTLE OR NOTHING THEN AND THAT LIFE WAS MORE LIKE A GREAT FAIRY STORY WHICH I WAS JUST ABOUT TO BEGIN TO READ THAN ANYTHING ELSE
1985-144468-0006 FOR A YEAR OR MORE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO FIND A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO HER OFTEN REPEATED QUESTION
1985-144468-0007 BUT I HAD NO PARTICULAR LIKING THAT I COULD DISCOVER FOR ANYTHING
1985-144468-0008 I THINK I MIGHT HAVE CONSIDERED MYSELF COMPLETELY SUITED BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY SUCH MIRACULOUS PROVISION MY DESIRE WAS TO APPLY MYSELF TO SOME PURSUIT THAT WOULD NOT LIE TOO HEAVILY UPON HER PURSE AND TO DO MY DUTY IN IT WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE
1985-144468-0009 MISTER DICK HAD REGULARLY ASSISTED AT OUR COUNCILS WITH A MEDITATIVE AND SAGE DEMEANOUR HE NEVER MADE A SUGGESTION BUT ONCE AND ON THAT OCCASION I DON'T KNOW WHAT PUT IT IN HIS HEAD HE SUDDENLY PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD BE A BRAZIER
1985-144468-0010 MY AUNT RECEIVED THIS PROPOSAL SO VERY UNGRACIOUSLY THAT HE NEVER VENTURED ON A SECOND BUT EVER AFTERWARDS CONFINED HIMSELF TO LOOKING WATCHFULLY AT HER FOR HER SUGGESTIONS AND RATTLING HIS MONEY
1985-144468-0011 TROT I TELL YOU WHAT MY DEAR SAID MY AUNT ONE MORNING IN THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL AS THIS KNOTTY POINT IS STILL UNSETTLED AND AS WE MUST NOT MAKE A MISTAKE IN OUR DECISION IF WE CAN HELP IT I THINK WE HAD BETTER TAKE A LITTLE BREATHING TIME
1985-144468-0012 IN THE MEANWHILE YOU MUST TRY TO LOOK AT IT FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW AND NOT AS A SCHOOLBOY I WILL AUNT IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME PURSUED MY AUNT THAT A LITTLE CHANGE AND A GLIMPSE OF LIFE OUT OF DOORS MAY BE USEFUL IN HELPING YOU TO KNOW YOUR OWN MIND AND FORM A COOLER JUDGEMENT
1985-144468-0013 SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO GO DOWN INTO THE OLD PART OF THE COUNTRY AGAIN FOR INSTANCE AND SEE THAT THAT OUT OF THE WAY WOMAN WITH THE SAVAGEST OF NAMES SAID MY AUNT RUBBING HER NOSE FOR SHE COULD NEVER THOROUGHLY FORGIVE PEGGOTTY FOR BEING SO CALLED
1985-144468-0014 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD AUNT I SHOULD LIKE IT BEST WELL SAID MY AUNT THAT'S LUCKY FOR I SHOULD LIKE IT TOO BUT IT'S NATURAL AND RATIONAL THAT YOU SHOULD LIKE IT
1985-144468-0015 I HOPE SO AUNT YOUR SISTER BETSEY TROTWOOD SAID MY AUNT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS NATURAL AND RATIONAL A GIRL AS EVER BREATHED YOU'LL BE WORTHY OF HER WON'T YOU I HOPE I SHALL BE WORTHY OF YOU AUNT THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR ME
1985-144468-0016 IT'S A MERCY THAT POOR DEAR BABY OF A MOTHER OF YOURS DIDN'T LIVE SAID MY AUNT LOOKING AT ME APPROVINGLY OR SHE'D HAVE BEEN SO VAIN OF HER BOY BY THIS TIME THAT HER SOFT LITTLE HEAD WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY TURNED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING OF IT LEFT TO TURN
1985-144468-0017 MY AUNT ALWAYS EXCUSED ANY WEAKNESS OF HER OWN IN MY BEHALF BY TRANSFERRING IT IN THIS WAY TO MY POOR MOTHER BLESS ME TROTWOOD HOW YOU DO REMIND ME OF HER PLEASANTLY I HOPE AUNT SAID I HE'S AS LIKE HER DICK SAID MY AUNT EMPHATICALLY
1985-144468-0018 HE'S AS LIKE HER AS SHE WAS THAT AFTERNOON BEFORE SHE BEGAN TO FRET BLESS MY HEART HE'S AS LIKE HER AS HE CAN LOOK AT ME OUT OF HIS TWO EYES IS HE INDEED SAID MISTER DICK AND HE'S LIKE DAVID TOO SAID MY AUNT DECISIVELY HE IS VERY LIKE DAVID SAID MISTER DICK
1985-144468-0019 BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO BE TROT RESUMED MY AUNT I DON'T MEAN PHYSICALLY BUT MORALLY YOU ARE VERY WELL PHYSICALLY
1985-144468-0020 WITH RESOLUTION SAID MY AUNT SHAKING HER CAP AT ME AND CLENCHING HER HAND WITH DETERMINATION WITH CHARACTER TROT WITH STRENGTH OF CHARACTER THAT IS NOT TO BE INFLUENCED EXCEPT ON GOOD REASON BY ANYBODY OR BY ANYTHING THAT'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO BE THAT'S WHAT YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER MIGHT BOTH HAVE BEEN
1985-144468-0021 HEAVEN KNOWS AND BEEN THE BETTER FOR IT I INTIMATED THAT I HOPED I SHOULD BE WHAT SHE DESCRIBED
1985-144468-0022 I SHALL SEND YOU UPON YOUR TRIP ALONE I DID THINK ONCE OF MISTER DICK'S GOING WITH YOU BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS I SHALL KEEP HIM TO TAKE CARE OF ME MISTER DICK FOR A MOMENT LOOKED A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
1985-144468-0023 UNTIL THE HONOUR AND DIGNITY OF HAVING TO TAKE CARE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD RESTORED THE SUNSHINE TO HIS FACE BESIDES SAID MY AUNT THERE'S THE MEMORIAL OH CERTAINLY SAID MISTER DICK IN A HURRY I INTEND TROTWOOD TO GET THAT DONE IMMEDIATELY IT REALLY MUST BE DONE IMMEDIATELY
1985-144468-0024 AND THEN IT WILL GO IN YOU KNOW AND THEN SAID MISTER DICK AFTER CHECKING HIMSELF AND PAUSING A LONG TIME THERE'LL BE A PRETTY KETTLE OF FISH IN PURSUANCE OF MY AUNT'S KIND SCHEME I WAS SHORTLY AFTERWARDS FITTED OUT WITH A HANDSOME PURSE OF MONEY
1985-144468-0025 AND A PORTMANTEAU AND TENDERLY DISMISSED UPON MY EXPEDITION AT PARTING MY AUNT GAVE ME SOME GOOD ADVICE AND A GOOD MANY KISSES AND SAID THAT AS HER OBJECT WAS THAT I SHOULD LOOK ABOUT ME AND SHOULD THINK A LITTLE SHE WOULD RECOMMEND ME TO STAY A FEW DAYS IN LONDON
1985-144468-0026 IN A WORD I WAS AT LIBERTY TO DO WHAT I WOULD FOR THREE WEEKS OR A MONTH AND NO OTHER CONDITIONS WERE IMPOSED UPON MY FREEDOM THAN THE BEFORE MENTIONED THINKING AND LOOKING ABOUT ME AND A PLEDGE TO WRITE THREE TIMES A WEEK AND FAITHFULLY REPORT MYSELF
1985-144468-0027 I WENT TO CANTERBURY FIRST THAT I MIGHT TAKE LEAVE OF AGNES AND MISTER WICKFIELD MY OLD ROOM IN WHOSE HOUSE I HAD NOT YET RELINQUISHED AND ALSO OF THE GOOD DOCTOR AGNES WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE ME AND TOLD ME THAT THE HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN LIKE ITSELF SINCE I HAD LEFT IT
1985-144468-0028 I AM SURE I AM NOT LIKE MYSELF WHEN I AM AWAY SAID I I SEEM TO WANT MY RIGHT HAND WHEN I MISS YOU THOUGH THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH FOR THERE'S NO HEAD IN MY RIGHT HAND AND NO HEART EVERYONE WHO KNOWS YOU CONSULTS WITH YOU AND IS GUIDED BY YOU AGNES
1985-144468-0029 EVERYONE WHO KNOWS ME SPOILS ME I BELIEVE SHE ANSWERED SMILING NO IT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE LIKE NO ONE ELSE YOU ARE SO GOOD AND SO SWEET TEMPERED YOU HAVE SUCH A GENTLE NATURE AND YOU ARE ALWAYS RIGHT
1985-144468-0030 AS IF I WERE THE LATE MISS LARKINS COME IT'S NOT FAIR TO ABUSE MY CONFIDENCE I ANSWERED REDDENING AT THE RECOLLECTION OF MY BLUE ENSLAVER
1985-144468-0031 EVEN WHEN I COME TO FALL IN LOVE IN EARNEST WHY YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN EARNEST SAID AGNES LAUGHING AGAIN OH THAT WAS AS A CHILD OR A SCHOOLBOY SAID I LAUGHING IN MY TURN NOT WITHOUT BEING A LITTLE SHAME FACED
1985-144468-0032 TIMES ARE ALTERING NOW AND I SUPPOSE I SHALL BE IN A TERRIBLE STATE OF EARNESTNESS ONE DAY OR OTHER MY WONDER IS THAT YOU ARE NOT IN EARNEST YOURSELF BY THIS TIME AGNES AGNES LAUGHED AGAIN AND SHOOK HER HEAD
1985-144468-0033 BUT THERE IS NO ONE THAT I KNOW OF WHO DESERVES TO LOVE YOU AGNES SOMEONE OF A NOBLER CHARACTER AND MORE WORTHY ALTOGETHER THAN ANYONE I HAVE EVER SEEN HERE MUST RISE UP BEFORE I GIVE MY CONSENT
1985-144468-0034 IN THE TIME TO COME I SHALL HAVE A WARY EYE ON ALL ADMIRERS AND SHALL EXACT A GREAT DEAL FROM THE SUCCESSFUL ONE I ASSURE YOU WE HAD GONE ON SO FAR IN A MIXTURE OF CONFIDENTIAL JEST AND EARNEST
1985-144468-0035 BUT AGNES NOW SUDDENLY LIFTING UP HER EYES TO MINE AND SPEAKING IN A DIFFERENT MANNER SAID TROTWOOD THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU AND THAT I MAY NOT HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS SOMETHING I WOULD ASK I THINK OF NO ONE ELSE
1985-144468-0036 HAVE YOU OBSERVED ANY GRADUAL ALTERATION IN PAPA
1985-144468-0037 I MUST HAVE SHOWN AS MUCH NOW IN MY FACE FOR HER EYES WERE IN A MOMENT CAST DOWN AND I SAW TEARS IN THEM TELL ME WHAT IT IS SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE I THINK SHALL I BE QUITE PLAIN AGNES LIKING HIM SO MUCH YES SHE SAID
1985-144468-0038 I THINK HE DOES HIMSELF NO GOOD BY THE HABIT THAT HAS INCREASED UPON HIM SINCE I FIRST CAME HERE HE IS OFTEN VERY NERVOUS OR I FANCY SO IT IS NOT FANCY SAID AGNES SHAKING HER HEAD HIS HAND TREMBLES HIS SPEECH IS NOT PLAIN AND HIS EYES LOOK WILD
1985-144468-0039 YES AND THE SENSE OF BEING UNFIT FOR IT OR OF NOT HAVING UNDERSTOOD IT OR OF HAVING SHOWN HIS CONDITION IN SPITE OF HIMSELF SEEMS TO MAKE HIM SO UNEASY THAT NEXT DAY HE IS WORSE AND NEXT DAY WORSE
1985-144468-0040 DO NOT BE ALARMED BY WHAT I SAY AGNES BUT IN THIS STATE I SAW HIM ONLY THE OTHER EVENING LAY DOWN HIS HEAD UPON HIS DESK AND SHED TEARS LIKE A CHILD HER HAND PASSED SOFTLY BEFORE MY LIPS WHILE I WAS YET SPEAKING
1985-144468-0041 AND IN A MOMENT SHE HAD MET HER FATHER AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM AND WAS HANGING ON HIS SHOULDER THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE AS THEY BOTH LOOKED TOWARDS ME I FELT TO BE VERY TOUCHING
1985-144468-0042 AND THERE WAS SUCH A FERVENT APPEAL TO ME TO DEAL TENDERLY BY HIM EVEN IN MY INMOST THOUGHTS AND TO LET NO HARSH CONSTRUCTION FIND ANY PLACE AGAINST HIM SHE WAS AT ONCE SO PROUD OF HIM AND DEVOTED TO HIM YET SO COMPASSIONATE AND SORRY AND SO RELIANT UPON ME TO BE SO TOO
1985-144468-0043 THAT NOTHING SHE COULD HAVE SAID WOULD HAVE EXPRESSED MORE TO ME OR MOVED ME MORE
1985-144468-0044 THE DOCTOR WHO MADE AS MUCH OF MY GOING AWAY AS IF I WERE GOING TO CHINA RECEIVED ME AS AN HONOURED GUEST AND CALLED FOR A LOG OF WOOD TO BE THROWN ON THE FIRE THAT HE MIGHT SEE THE FACE OF HIS OLD PUPIL REDDENING IN THE BLAZE
1985-144468-0045 I SHALL NOT SEE MANY MORE NEW FACES IN TROTWOOD'S STEAD WICKFIELD SAID THE DOCTOR WARMING HIS HANDS I AM GETTING LAZY AND WANT EASE I SHALL RELINQUISH ALL MY YOUNG PEOPLE IN ANOTHER SIX MONTHS AND LEAD A QUIETER LIFE
1985-144468-0046 BUT NOW I MEAN TO DO IT RETURNED THE DOCTOR
1985-144468-0047 AND TO TAKE CARE SAID MISTER WICKFIELD THAT YOU'RE NOT IMPOSED ON EH
1985-144468-0048 WELL I AM READY THERE ARE WORSE TASKS THAN THAT IN MY CALLING I SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO THINK OF THEN SAID THE DOCTOR WITH A SMILE BUT MY DICTIONARY AND THIS OTHER CONTRACT BARGAIN ANNIE
1985-144468-0049 AS MISTER WICKFIELD GLANCED TOWARDS HER SITTING AT THE TEA TABLE BY AGNES SHE SEEMED TO ME TO AVOID HIS LOOK WITH SUCH UNWONTED HESITATION AND TIMIDITY THAT HIS ATTENTION BECAME FIXED UPON HER AS IF SOMETHING WERE SUGGESTED TO HIS THOUGHTS
1985-144468-0050 BY THE BY AND LETTERS FROM MISTER JACK MALDON SAID THE DOCTOR INDEED POOR DEAR JACK SAID MISSUS MARKLEHAM SHAKING HER HEAD THAT TRYING CLIMATE LIKE LIVING THEY TELL ME ON A SAND HEAP UNDERNEATH A BURNING GLASS
1985-144468-0051 FROM THE TIME WHEN MY DAUGHTER AND HIMSELF WERE CHILDREN TOGETHER AND WALKING ABOUT ARM IN ARM THE LIVELONG DAY
1985-144468-0052 ILL REPLIED THE OLD SOLDIER MY DEAR SIR HE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS EXCEPT WELL SAID MISTER WICKFIELD EXCEPT WELL INDEED SAID THE OLD SOLDIER
1985-144468-0053 AS TO HIS LIVER SAID THE OLD SOLDIER RESIGNEDLY THAT OF COURSE HE GAVE UP ALTOGETHER WHEN HE FIRST WENT OUT DOES HE SAY ALL THIS ASKED MISTER WICKFIELD SAY MY DEAR SIR RETURNED MISSUS MARKLEHAM SHAKING HER HEAD AND HER FAN
1985-144468-0054 YOU LITTLE KNOW MY POOR JACK MALDON WHEN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION SAY NOT HE YOU MIGHT DRAG HIM AT THE HEELS OF FOUR WILD HORSES FIRST MAMA SAID MISSUS STRONG ANNIE MY DEAR RETURNED HER MOTHER
1985-144468-0055 YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT YOUR COUSIN MALDON WOULD BE DRAGGED AT THE HEELS OF ANY NUMBER OF WILD HORSES
1985-144468-0056 TWO AND THIRTY RATHER THAN SAY ANYTHING CALCULATED TO OVERTURN THE DOCTOR'S PLANS WICKFIELD'S PLANS SAID THE DOCTOR STROKING HIS FACE AND LOOKING PENITENTLY AT HIS ADVISER THAT IS TO SAY OUR JOINT PLANS FOR HIM I SAID MYSELF ABROAD OR AT HOME
1985-144468-0057 AND I SAID ADDED MISTER WICKFIELD GRAVELY ABROAD I WAS THE MEANS OF SENDING HIM ABROAD IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY OH RESPONSIBILITY SAID THE OLD SOLDIER EVERYTHING WAS DONE FOR THE BEST MY DEAR MISTER WICKFIELD EVERYTHING WAS DONE FOR THE KINDEST AND BEST WE KNOW
1985-144468-0058 BUT IF THE DEAR FELLOW CAN'T LIVE THERE HE CAN'T LIVE THERE
1985-144468-0059 AND I KNOW HE'LL DIE THERE SOONER THAN HE'LL OVERTURN THE DOCTOR'S PLANS WELL WELL MA'AM SAID THE DOCTOR CHEERFULLY I AM NOT BIGOTED TO MY PLANS AND I CAN OVERTURN THEM MYSELF I CAN SUBSTITUTE SOME OTHER PLANS
1985-144468-0060 IF MISTER JACK MALDON COMES HOME ON ACCOUNT OF ILL HEALTH HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO GO BACK
1985-144468-0061 AFTER WHICH SHE GENTLY CHID HER DAUGHTER ANNIE FOR NOT BEING MORE DEMONSTRATIVE WHEN SUCH KINDNESSES WERE SHOWERED FOR HER SAKE ON HER OLD PLAYFELLOW AND ENTERTAINED US WITH SOME PARTICULARS CONCERNING OTHER DESERVING MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY WHOM IT WAS DESIRABLE TO SET ON THEIR DESERVING LEGS
1985-144468-0062 ALL THIS TIME HER DAUGHTER ANNIE NEVER ONCE SPOKE OR LIFTED UP HER EYES ALL THIS TIME MISTER WICKFIELD HAD HIS GLANCE UPON HER AS SHE SAT BY HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S SIDE IT APPEARED TO ME THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING OBSERVED BY ANYONE
1985-144468-0063 BUT WAS SO INTENT UPON HER AND UPON HIS OWN THOUGHTS IN CONNEXION WITH HER AS TO BE QUITE ABSORBED HE NOW ASKED WHAT MISTER JACK MALDON HAD ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF AND TO WHOM HE HAD WRITTEN WHY HERE SAID MISSUS MARKLEHAM TAKING A LETTER FROM THE CHIMNEY PIECE ABOVE THE DOCTOR'S HEAD
1985-144468-0064 THE DEAR FELLOW SAYS TO THE DOCTOR HIMSELF WHERE IS IT OH I AM SORRY TO INFORM YOU THAT MY HEALTH IS SUFFERING SEVERELY AND THAT I FEAR I MAY BE REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF RETURNING HOME FOR A TIME AS THE ONLY HOPE OF RESTORATION THAT'S PRETTY PLAIN POOR FELLOW
1985-144468-0065 HIS ONLY HOPE OF RESTORATION BUT ANNIE'S LETTER IS PLAINER STILL ANNIE SHOW ME THAT LETTER AGAIN NOT NOW MAMA SHE PLEADED IN A LOW TONE MY DEAR YOU ABSOLUTELY ARE ON SOME SUBJECTS ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS PERSONS IN THE WORLD RETURNED HER MOTHER
1985-144468-0066 AND PERHAPS THE MOST UNNATURAL TO THE CLAIMS OF YOUR OWN FAMILY WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE HEARD OF THE LETTER AT ALL I BELIEVE UNLESS I HAD ASKED FOR IT MYSELF
1985-144468-0067 I AM SURPRISED YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THE LETTER WAS RELUCTANTLY PRODUCED AND AS I HANDED IT TO THE OLD LADY I SAW HOW THE UNWILLING HAND FROM WHICH I TOOK IT TREMBLED NOW LET US SEE SAID MISSUS MARKLEHAM PUTTING HER GLASS TO HER EYE WHERE THE PASSAGE IS
1985-144468-0068 THE REMEMBRANCE OF OLD TIMES MY DEAREST ANNIE AND SO FORTH IT'S NOT THERE THE AMIABLE OLD PROCTOR WHO'S HE DEAR ME ANNIE HOW ILLEGIBLY YOUR COUSIN MALDON WRITES AND HOW STUPID I AM DOCTOR OF COURSE AH AMIABLE INDEED
1985-144468-0069 HERE SHE LEFT OFF TO KISS HER FAN AGAIN AND SHAKE IT AT THE DOCTOR WHO WAS LOOKING AT US IN A STATE OF PLACID SATISFACTION NOW I HAVE FOUND IT YOU MAY NOT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR ANNIE NO TO BE SURE KNOWING THAT HE NEVER WAS REALLY STRONG WHAT DID I SAY JUST NOW
1985-144468-0070 THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE SO MUCH IN THIS DISTANT PLACE AS TO HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE IT AT ALL HAZARDS ON SICK LEAVE IF I CAN ON TOTAL RESIGNATION IF THAT IS NOT TO BE OBTAINED WHAT I HAVE ENDURED AND DO ENDURE HERE IS INSUPPORTABLE
1985-144468-0071 AND BUT FOR THE PROMPTITUDE OF THAT BEST OF CREATURES SAID MISSUS MARKLEHAM
1985-144468-0072 IT WOULD BE INSUPPORTABLE TO ME TO THINK OF MISTER WICKFIELD SAID NOT ONE WORD THOUGH THE OLD LADY LOOKED TO HIM AS IF FOR HIS COMMENTARY ON THIS INTELLIGENCE BUT SAT SEVERELY SILENT WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND
1985-144468-0073 HE REMAINED SO SELDOM RAISING HIS EYES UNLESS TO REST THEM FOR A MOMENT WITH A THOUGHTFUL FROWN UPON THE DOCTOR OR HIS WIFE OR BOTH THE DOCTOR WAS VERY FOND OF MUSIC AGNES SANG WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND EXPRESSION AND SO DID MISSUS STRONG
1985-144468-0074 BUT I REMARKED TWO THINGS FIRST THAT THOUGH ANNIE SOON RECOVERED HER COMPOSURE AND WAS QUITE HERSELF THERE WAS A BLANK BETWEEN HER AND MISTER WICKFIELD WHICH SEPARATED THEM WHOLLY FROM EACH OTHER SECONDLY THAT MISTER WICKFIELD SEEMED TO DISLIKE THE INTIMACY BETWEEN HER AND AGNES
1985-144468-0075 AND TO WATCH IT WITH UNEASINESS AND NOW I MUST CONFESS
1985-144468-0076 AND TO TROUBLE ME THE INNOCENT BEAUTY OF HER FACE WAS NOT AS INNOCENT TO ME AS IT HAD BEEN I MISTRUSTED THE NATURAL GRACE AND CHARM OF HER MANNER AND WHEN I LOOKED AT AGNES BY HER SIDE
1985-144468-0077 AND THOUGHT HOW GOOD AND TRUE AGNES WAS SUSPICIONS AROSE WITHIN ME THAT IT WAS AN ILL ASSORTED FRIENDSHIP SHE WAS SO HAPPY IN IT HERSELF HOWEVER AND THE OTHER WAS SO HAPPY TOO THAT THEY MADE THE EVENING FLY AWAY AS IF IT WERE BUT AN HOUR
1985-144468-0078 IT CLOSED IN AN INCIDENT WHICH I WELL REMEMBER THEY WERE TAKING LEAVE OF EACH OTHER AND AGNES WAS GOING TO EMBRACE HER AND KISS HER WHEN MISTER WICKFIELD STEPPED BETWEEN THEM AS IF BY ACCIDENT AND DREW AGNES QUICKLY AWAY
1985-144468-0079 I CANNOT SAY WHAT AN IMPRESSION THIS MADE UPON ME OR HOW IMPOSSIBLE I FOUND IT WHEN I THOUGHT OF HER AFTERWARDS TO SEPARATE HER FROM THIS LOOK AND REMEMBER HER FACE IN ITS INNOCENT LOVELINESS AGAIN IT HAUNTED ME WHEN I GOT HOME I SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT THE DOCTOR'S ROOF WITH A DARK CLOUD LOWERING ON IT
1985-144468-0080 THE IMPENDING SHADOW OF A GREAT AFFLICTION AND A GREAT DISGRACE THAT HAD NO DISTINCT FORM IN IT YET FELL LIKE A STAIN UPON THE QUIET PLACE WHERE I HAD WORKED AND PLAYED AS A BOY
1985-144468-0081 IT WAS AS IF THE TRANQUIL SANCTUARY OF MY BOYHOOD HAD BEEN SACKED BEFORE MY FACE AND ITS PEACE AND HONOUR GIVEN TO THE WINDS BUT MORNING BROUGHT WITH IT MY PARTING FROM THE OLD HOUSE WHICH AGNES HAD FILLED WITH HER INFLUENCE AND THAT OCCUPIED MY MIND SUFFICIENTLY
1985-144468-0082 I SHOULD BE THERE AGAIN SOON NO DOUBT I MIGHT SLEEP AGAIN PERHAPS OFTEN IN MY OLD ROOM
1985-144468-0083 I WAS HEAVIER AT HEART WHEN I PACKED UP SUCH OF MY BOOKS AND CLOTHES AS STILL REMAINED THERE TO BE SENT TO DOVER
1985-144468-0084 WHO WAS SO OFFICIOUS TO HELP ME THAT I UNCHARITABLY THOUGHT HIM MIGHTY GLAD THAT I WAS GOING I GOT AWAY FROM AGNES AND HER FATHER SOMEHOW WITH AN INDIFFERENT SHOW OF BEING VERY MANLY AND TOOK MY SEAT UPON THE BOX OF THE LONDON COACH
1985-144468-0085 THAT I HAD HALF A MIND TO NOD TO MY OLD ENEMY THE BUTCHER AND THROW HIM FIVE SHILLINGS TO DRINK BUT HE LOOKED SUCH A VERY OBDURATE BUTCHER AS HE STOOD SCRAPING THE GREAT BLOCK IN THE SHOP AND MOREOVER HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO LITTLE IMPROVED BY THE LOSS OF A FRONT TOOTH WHICH I HAD KNOCKED OUT
1985-144468-0086 THAT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO MAKE NO ADVANCES THE MAIN OBJECT ON MY MIND I REMEMBER WHEN WE GOT FAIRLY ON THE ROAD WAS TO APPEAR AS OLD AS POSSIBLE TO THE COACHMAN AND TO SPEAK EXTREMELY GRUFF
1985-144468-0087 THE LATTER POINT I ACHIEVED AT GREAT PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE BUT I STUCK TO IT BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS A GROWN UP SORT OF THING YOU ARE GOING THROUGH SIR SAID THE COACHMAN YES WILLIAM I SAID CONDESCENDINGLY I KNEW HIM I AM GOING TO LONDON I SHALL GO DOWN INTO SUFFOLK AFTERWARDS
1985-144468-0088 SHOOTING SIR SAID THE COACHMAN HE KNEW AS WELL AS I DID THAT IT WAS JUST AS LIKELY AT THAT TIME OF YEAR I WAS GOING DOWN THERE WHALING BUT I FELT COMPLIMENTED TOO I DON'T KNOW I SAID PRETENDING TO BE UNDECIDED WHETHER I SHALL TAKE A SHOT OR NOT BIRDS IS GOT WERY SHY I'M TOLD SAID WILLIAM
1985-144468-0089 SO I UNDERSTAND SAID I IS SUFFOLK YOUR COUNTY SIR ASKED WILLIAM YES I SAID WITH SOME IMPORTANCE SUFFOLK'S MY COUNTY I'M TOLD THE DUMPLINGS IS UNCOMMON FINE DOWN THERE SAID WILLIAM I WAS NOT AWARE OF IT MYSELF BUT I FELT IT NECESSARY TO UPHOLD THE INSTITUTIONS OF MY COUNTY
1985-144468-0090 AIN'T I WHAT SAID THE GENTLEMAN BEHIND BRED THEM SUFFOLK PUNCHES BY WHOLESALE
1985-144468-0091 THEY'RE WITTLES AND DRINK TO ME LODGING WIFE AND CHILDREN READING WRITING AND ARITHMETIC SNUFF TOBACKER AND SLEEP
1985-144468-0092 I CONSTRUED THIS REMARK INTO AN INDICATION OF A WISH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE MY PLACE SO I BLUSHINGLY OFFERED TO RESIGN IT WELL IF YOU DON'T MIND SIR SAID WILLIAM I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE CORRECT
1985-144468-0093 I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED THIS AS THE FIRST FALL I HAD IN LIFE WHEN I BOOKED MY PLACE AT THE COACH OFFICE I HAD HAD BOX SEAT WRITTEN AGAINST THE ENTRY AND HAD GIVEN THE BOOK KEEPER HALF A CROWN I WAS GOT UP IN A SPECIAL GREAT COAT AND SHAWL EXPRESSLY TO DO HONOUR TO THAT DISTINGUISHED EMINENCE
1985-144468-0094 AND HERE IN THE VERY FIRST STAGE I WAS SUPPLANTED BY A SHABBY MAN WITH A SQUINT WHO HAD NO OTHER MERIT THAN SMELLING LIKE A LIVERY STABLES AND BEING ABLE TO WALK ACROSS ME MORE LIKE A FLY THAN A HUMAN BEING WHILE THE HORSES WERE AT A CANTER
1985-144468-0095 A DISTRUST OF MYSELF WHICH HAS OFTEN BESET ME IN LIFE ON SMALL OCCASIONS WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AWAY WAS ASSUREDLY NOT STOPPED IN ITS GROWTH BY THIS LITTLE INCIDENT OUTSIDE THE CANTERBURY COACH IT WAS IN VAIN TO TAKE REFUGE IN GRUFFNESS OF SPEECH
1985-144468-0096 I SPOKE FROM THE PIT OF MY STOMACH FOR THE REST OF THE JOURNEY BUT I FELT COMPLETELY EXTINGUISHED AND DREADFULLY YOUNG IT WAS CURIOUS AND INTERESTING NEVERTHELESS TO BE SITTING UP THERE BEHIND FOUR HORSES WELL EDUCATED WELL DRESSED AND WITH PLENTY OF MONEY IN MY POCKET
1985-144468-0097 AND TO LOOK OUT FOR THE PLACES WHERE I HAD SLEPT ON MY WEARY JOURNEY I HAD ABUNDANT OCCUPATION FOR MY THOUGHTS IN EVERY CONSPICUOUS LANDMARK ON THE ROAD WHEN I LOOKED DOWN AT THE TRAMPERS WHOM WE PASSED AND SAW THAT WELL REMEMBERED STYLE OF FACE TURNED UP
1985-144468-0098 WHEN WE CLATTERED THROUGH THE NARROW STREET OF CHATHAM AND I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE IN PASSING OF THE LANE WHERE THE OLD MONSTER LIVED WHO HAD BOUGHT MY JACKET I STRETCHED MY NECK EAGERLY TO LOOK FOR THE PLACE WHERE I HAD SAT
1985-144468-0099 WE WENT TO THE GOLDEN CROSS AT CHARING CROSS THEN A MOULDY SORT OF ESTABLISHMENT IN A CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD A WAITER SHOWED ME INTO THE COFFEE ROOM AND A CHAMBERMAID INTRODUCED ME TO MY SMALL BEDCHAMBER WHICH SMELT LIKE A HACKNEY COACH AND WAS SHUT UP LIKE A FAMILY VAULT
1985-144468-0100 I WAS STILL PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MY YOUTH FOR NOBODY STOOD IN ANY AWE OF ME AT ALL
1985-144468-0101 WELL NOW SAID THE WAITER IN A TONE OF CONFIDENCE WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR DINNER YOUNG GENTLEMEN LIKES POULTRY IN GENERAL HAVE A FOWL I TOLD HIM AS MAJESTICALLY AS I COULD THAT I WASN'T IN THE HUMOUR FOR A FOWL AIN'T YOU SAID THE WAITER
1985-144468-0102 YOUNG GENTLEMEN IS GENERALLY TIRED OF BEEF AND MUTTON HAVE A WEAL CUTLET
1985-144468-0103 YOUNG GENTLEMEN GENERALLY HAS BEEN OVERDOSED WITH TATERS I COMMANDED HIM IN MY DEEPEST VOICE
1985-144468-0104 LETTERS FOR TROTWOOD COPPERFIELD ESQUIRE WHICH I KNEW THERE WERE NOT AND COULDN'T BE BUT THOUGHT IT MANLY TO APPEAR TO EXPECT HE SOON CAME BACK TO SAY THAT THERE WERE NONE AT WHICH I WAS MUCH SURPRISED AND BEGAN TO LAY THE CLOTH FOR MY DINNER IN A BOX BY THE FIRE
1985-144468-0105 WHILE HE WAS SO ENGAGED HE ASKED ME WHAT I WOULD TAKE WITH IT AND ON MY REPLYING HALF A PINT OF SHERRY
1985-144468-0106 I AM OF THIS OPINION BECAUSE WHILE I WAS READING THE NEWSPAPER I OBSERVED HIM BEHIND A LOW WOODEN PARTITION WHICH WAS HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT VERY BUSY POURING OUT OF A NUMBER OF THOSE VESSELS INTO ONE LIKE A CHEMIST AND DRUGGIST MAKING UP A PRESCRIPTION
1985-144468-0107 BUT I WAS BASHFUL ENOUGH TO DRINK IT AND SAY NOTHING BEING THEN IN A PLEASANT FRAME OF MIND FROM WHICH I INFER THAT POISONING IS NOT ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE IN SOME STAGES OF THE PROCESS I RESOLVED TO GO TO THE PLAY
1985-144468-0108 IT WAS COVENT GARDEN THEATRE THAT I CHOSE AND THERE FROM THE BACK OF A CENTRE BOX I SAW JULIUS CAESAR
1985-144468-0109 WAS A MOST NOVEL AND DELIGHTFUL EFFECT BUT THE MINGLED REALITY AND MYSTERY OF THE WHOLE SHOW THE INFLUENCE UPON ME OF THE POETRY THE LIGHTS THE MUSIC THE COMPANY
1985-144468-0110 WERE SO DAZZLING AND OPENED UP SUCH ILLIMITABLE REGIONS OF DELIGHT THAT WHEN I CAME OUT INTO THE RAINY STREET AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I FELT AS IF I HAD COME FROM THE CLOUDS WHERE I HAD BEEN LEADING A ROMANTIC LIFE FOR AGES TO A BAWLING SPLASHING LINK LIGHTED UMBRELLA STRUGGLING HACKNEY COACH JOSTLING
1985-144468-0111 PATTEN CLINKING MUDDY MISERABLE WORLD I HAD EMERGED BY ANOTHER DOOR AND STOOD IN THE STREET FOR A LITTLE WHILE AS IF I REALLY WERE A STRANGER UPON EARTH BUT THE UNCEREMONIOUS PUSHING AND HUSTLING THAT I RECEIVED SOON RECALLED ME TO MYSELF
1985-144468-0112 AND PUT ME IN THE ROAD BACK TO THE HOTEL WHITHER I WENT REVOLVING THE GLORIOUS VISION ALL THE WAY AND WHERE AFTER SOME PORTER AND OYSTERS I SAT REVOLVING IT STILL AT PAST ONE O'CLOCK WITH MY EYES ON THE COFFEE ROOM FIRE
1985-144468-0113 THROUGH WHICH I SAW MY EARLIER LIFE MOVING ALONG THAT I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE FIGURE OF A HANDSOME WELL FORMED YOUNG MAN DRESSED WITH A TASTEFUL EASY NEGLIGENCE WHICH I HAVE REASON TO REMEMBER VERY WELL BECAME A REAL PRESENCE TO ME
