6391-65553-0000 THE LYNNFIELD PEOPLE SHRUGGED THEIR SHOULDERS AND SAID HE MIGHT HAVE PICKED OUT SOMEBODY A LITTLE YOUNGER AND PRETTIER BUT THEN OF COURSE BESSY WAS WELL OFF A TWO HUNDRED ACRE FARM AND A SUBSTANTIAL BANK ACCOUNT WERE WORTH GOING IN FOR
6391-65553-0001 TRUST AN EASTMAN FOR KNOWING UPON WHICH SIDE HIS BREAD WAS BUTTERED LAWRENCE WAS ONLY TWENTY AND LOOKED EVEN YOUNGER OWING TO HIS SMOOTH BOYISH FACE CURLY HAIR AND HALF GIRLISH BLOOM
6391-65553-0002 BESSY HOUGHTON WAS IN REALITY NO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE BUT LYNNFIELD PEOPLE HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS PAST THIRTY SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN OLDER THAN HER YEARS
6391-65553-0003 A QUIET RESERVED GIRL WHO DRESSED PLAINLY AND NEVER WENT ABOUT WITH OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE HER MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN BESSY WAS VERY YOUNG
6391-65553-0004 WHEN SHE WAS TWENTY HER FATHER DIED AND BESSY WAS HIS SOLE HEIR SHE KEPT THE FARM AND TOOK THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT IN HER OWN CAPABLE HANDS SHE MADE A SUCCESS OF IT TOO WHICH WAS MORE THAN MANY A MAN IN LYNNFIELD HAD DONE
6391-65553-0005 BESSY HAD NEVER HAD A LOVER
6391-65553-0006 AND PASSED FOR AN OLD MAID WHEN HER CONTEMPORARIES WERE IN THE FLUSH OF SOCIAL SUCCESS AND BLOOM MISSUS EASTMAN LAWRENCE'S MOTHER WAS A WIDOW WITH TWO SONS GEORGE THE OLDER WAS THE MOTHER'S FAVOURITE
6391-65553-0007 AND THE PROPERTY HAD BEEN WILLED TO HIM BY HIS FATHER TO LAWRENCE HAD BEEN LEFT THE FEW HUNDREDS IN THE BANK HE STAYED AT HOME AND HIRED HIMSELF TO GEORGE THEREBY ADDING SLOWLY TO HIS SMALL HOARD
6391-65553-0008 HE HAD HIS EYE ON A FARM IN LYNNFIELD BUT HE WAS AS YET A MERE BOY AND HIS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE WERE VERY VAGUE UNTIL HE FELL IN LOVE
6391-65553-0009 IN REALITY NOBODY WAS MORE SURPRISED OVER THIS THAN LAWRENCE HIMSELF IT HAD CERTAINLY BEEN THE LAST THING IN HIS THOUGHTS ON THE DARK DAMP NIGHT WHEN HE HAD OVERTAKEN BESSY WALKING HOME ALONE FROM PRAYER MEETING AND HAD OFFERED TO DRIVE HER THE REST OF THE WAY
6391-65553-0010 AT FIRST SHE WAS VERY SILENT AND LAWRENCE WHO WAS A BASHFUL LAD AT THE BEST OF TIMES FELT TONGUE TIED AND UNCOMFORTABLE BUT PRESENTLY BESSY PITYING HIS EVIDENT EMBARRASSMENT BEGAN TO TALK TO HIM
6391-65553-0011 SHE COULD TALK WELL AND LAWRENCE FOUND HIMSELF ENTERING EASILY INTO THE SPIRIT OF HER PIQUANT SPEECHES
6391-65553-0012 HE HAD CERTAINLY NEVER GUESSED THAT SHE COULD BE SUCH GOOD COMPANY SHE WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER GIRLS HE KNEW BUT HE DECIDED THAT HE LIKED THE DIFFERENCE ARE YOU GOING TO THE PARTY AT BAILEYS TOMORROW NIGHT HE ASKED
6391-65553-0013 AS HE HELPED HER TO ALIGHT AT HER DOOR I DON'T KNOW SHE ANSWERED I'M INVITED
6391-65553-0014 AND PARTIES HAVE NEVER BEEN VERY MUCH IN MY LINE THERE WAS A WISTFUL NOTE IN HER VOICE AND LAWRENCE DETECTING IT SAID HURRIEDLY NOT GIVING HIMSELF TIME TO GET FRIGHTENED OH YOU'D BETTER GO TO THIS ONE AND IF YOU LIKE
6391-65553-0015 I'LL CALL AROUND AND TAKE YOU HE WONDERED IF SHE WOULD THINK HIM VERY PRESUMPTUOUS HE THOUGHT HER VOICE SOUNDED COLDER AS SHE SAID I AM AFRAID THAT IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE FOR YOU IT WOULDN'T BE ANY TROUBLE AT ALL
6391-65553-0016 HE STAMMERED I'LL BE VERY PLEASED TO TAKE YOU IN THE END BESSY HAD CONSENTED TO GO AND THE NEXT EVENING LAWRENCE CALLED FOR HER IN THE ROSE RED AUTUMN DUSK
6391-65553-0017 SHE WAS DRESSED IN WHAT WAS FOR HER UNUSUAL ELEGANCE AND LAWRENCE WONDERED WHY
6391-65553-0018 HER FIGURE WAS STRIKINGLY SYMMETRICAL AND SOFTLY CURVED HER ABUNDANT DARK BROWN HAIR INSTEAD OF BEING PARTED PLAINLY AND DRAWN BACK INTO A PRIM COIL AS USUAL WAS DRESSED HIGH ON HER HEAD
6391-65553-0019 AND A CREAMY ROSE NESTLED AMID THE BECOMING PUFFS AND WAVES SHE WORE BLACK AS SHE USUALLY DID BUT IT WAS A LUSTROUS BLACK SILK SIMPLY AND FASHIONABLY MADE
6391-65553-0020 WITH FROST LIKE FRILLS OF LACE AT HER FIRM ROUND THROAT AND DAINTY WRISTS HER CHEEKS WERE DELICATELY FLUSHED AND HER WOOD BROWN EYES WERE SPARKLING UNDER HER LONG LASHES
6391-65553-0021 SHE OFFERED HIM A HALF OPENED BUD FOR HIS COAT AND PINNED IT ON FOR HIM AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER HE NOTICED WHAT A SWEET MOUTH SHE HAD FULL AND RED WITH A HALF CHILD LIKE CURVE
6391-65553-0022 MADE QUITE A SENSATION AT THAT FESTAL SCENE PEOPLE NODDED AND WINKED AND WONDERED
6391-65553-0023 MILLY AS WAS WELL KNOWN HAD A LIKING FOR LAWRENCE HERSELF LAWRENCE BEGAN TO GO WITH BESSY HOUGHTON REGULARLY AFTER THAT
6391-65553-0024 IN HIS SINGLE MINDEDNESS HE NEVER FEARED THAT BESSY WOULD MISJUDGE HIS MOTIVES OR IMAGINE HIM TO BE PROMPTED BY MERCENARY DESIGNS HE NEVER THOUGHT OF HER RICHES HIMSELF AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT SHE WOULD SUPPOSE HE DID
6391-65553-0025 HE SOON REALIZED THAT HE LOVED HER AND HE VENTURED TO HOPE TIMIDLY THAT SHE LOVED HIM IN RETURN SHE WAS ALWAYS RATHER RESERVED BUT THE FEW FAVOURS THAT MEANT NOTHING FROM OTHER GIRLS MEANT A GREAT DEAL FROM BESSY
6391-65553-0026 THE EVENINGS HE SPENT WITH HER IN HER PRETTY SITTING ROOM THEIR MOONLIGHT DRIVES OVER LONG SATIN SMOOTH STRETCHES OF SNOWY ROADS AND THEIR WALKS HOME FROM CHURCH AND PRAYER MEETING UNDER THE WINTER STARS

6391-65553-0028 AND WHO WOULD CERTAINLY THROW HIM OVER IN THE END
6391-65553-0029 MISSUS EASTMAN WAS A PROUD WOMAN AND A DETERMINED ONE
6391-65553-0030 AND SHE WENT HOME FROM THE QUILTING RESOLVED TO PUT AN INSTANT STOP TO ALL SUCH NONSENSE
6391-65553-0031 AS SHE ENTERED THE SMALL KITCHEN WHERE GEORGE EASTMAN WAS LOUNGING BY THE FIRE OUT IN THE STABLE GROOMING UP LADY GREY RESPONDED HER OLDER SON SULKILY
6391-65553-0032 SAID MISSUS EASTMAN GRIMLY
6391-65553-0033 GEORGE EASTMAN MUTTERED SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HER HE WAS A SHORT THICKSET MAN NOT IN THE LEAST LIKE LAWRENCE WHO WAS TEN YEARS HIS JUNIOR TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY
6391-65553-0034 AND HER DECIDED REPULSE OF HIS ADVANCES WAS A REMEMBRANCE THAT MADE HIM GRIT HIS TEETH YET HE HAD HATED HER BITTERLY EVER SINCE LAWRENCE WAS BRUSHING HIS PET MARE'S COAT UNTIL IT SHONE LIKE SATIN AND WHISTLING
6391-65553-0035 ANNIE LAURIE UNTIL THE RAFTERS RANG BESSY HAD SUNG IT FOR HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE
6391-65553-0036 WITH HER FAVOURITE LACES AT WRIST AND THROAT AND A WHITE ROSE IN HER HAIR WHICH WAS DRESSED IN THE HIGH BECOMING KNOT SHE HAD ALWAYS WORN
6391-65553-0037 SHE HAD PLAYED AND SUNG MANY OF THE SWEET OLD SCOTCH BALLADS FOR HIM AND WHEN SHE HAD GONE TO THE DOOR WITH HIM
6391-65553-0038 EMBOLDENED BY THE LOOK IN HER BROWN EYES HE HAD STOOPED AND KISSED HER THEN HE HAD STEPPED BACK
6391-65553-0039 AND ONLY BLUSHED HOTLY CRIMSON SHE MUST CARE FOR HIM HE THOUGHT HAPPILY OR ELSE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANGRY WHEN HIS MOTHER CAME IN AT THE STABLE DOOR HER FACE WAS HARD AND UNCOMPROMISING LAWRIE
6391-65553-0040 COME NOW DON'T QUIZ A FELLOW TOO CLOSE

6391-65553-0045 SHE HAD SUPPOSED HER WORD WOULD BE LAW REBELLION WAS SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT DREAMED OF HER LIPS TIGHTENED OMINOUSLY AND HER EYES NARROWED
6391-65553-0046 SHE SAID IN A VOICE THAT TREMBLED WITH ANGER BESSY HOUGHTON LAUGHS AT YOU EVERYWHERE

6391-65553-0048 SHE DREW HER SHAWL ABOUT HER PALE MALICIOUS FACE AND LEFT HIM WITH A PARTING GLANCE OF CONTEMPT I GUESS THAT'LL SETTLE HIM SHE THOUGHT GRIMLY
6391-65553-0049 ALONE IN THE STABLE
6391-65553-0050 HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN HIS MOTHER AND THE STAB HAD GONE STRAIGHT TO HIS HEART
6391-65553-0051 FOR HIS WELL KNOWN FOOTFALL ON THE VERANDAH THE NEXT NIGHT LAWRENCE WENT HOME WITH MILLY FISKE FROM PRAYER MEETING
6391-65553-0052 AS SHE CAME DOWN THE STEPS OF THE LITTLE CHURCH BESSY WALKED HOME ALONE
6391-65553-0053 AND IN THE MIRROR OVER THE MANTEL SHE SAW HER OWN PALE FACE WITH ITS TRAGIC PAIN STRICKEN EYES ANNIE HILLIS HER HELP WAS OUT SHE WAS ALONE IN THE BIG HOUSE WITH HER MISERY AND DESPAIR
6391-65553-0054 AND FLUNG HERSELF ON THE BED IN THE CHILL MOONLIGHT IT IS ALL OVER SHE SAID DULLY ALL NIGHT SHE LAY THERE FIGHTING WITH HER PAIN
6391-65553-0055 IN THE WAN GREY MORNING SHE LOOKED AT HER MIRRORED SELF WITH PITYING SCORN AT THE PALLID FACE THE LIFELESS FEATURES THE DISPIRITED EYES WITH THEIR BLUISH CIRCLES
6391-65553-0056 WHAT A FOOL I HAVE BEEN TO IMAGINE HE COULD CARE FOR ME SHE SAID BITTERLY
6391-65553-0057 SHE THOUGHT OF THAT KISS WITH A PITIFUL SHAME SHE HATED HERSELF FOR THE WEAKNESS THAT COULD NOT CHECK HER TEARS HER LONELY LIFE HAD BEEN BRIGHTENED BY THE COMPANIONSHIP OF HER YOUNG LOVER THE YOUTH
6391-65553-0058 AND GIRLHOOD OF WHICH FATE HAD CHEATED HER HAD COME TO HER WITH LOVE THE FUTURE HAD LOOKED ROSY WITH PROMISE NOW IT HAD DARKENED WITH DOURNESS AND GREYNESS
