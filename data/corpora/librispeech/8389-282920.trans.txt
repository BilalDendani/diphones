8389-282920-0011 I WAS FEELING LIKE ADAM BEFORE THE APPLE STAMPEDE AND WAS DIGGING MY SPURS INTO THE SIDE OF THE COUNTER AND WORKING WITH MY TWENTY FOUR INCH SPOON WHEN I HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO THE YARD OF UNCLE EMSLEY'S HOUSE WHICH WAS NEXT TO THE STORE
8389-282920-0012 THERE WAS A GIRL STANDING THERE AN IMPORTED GIRL WITH FIXINGS ON PHILANDERING WITH A CROQUET MAUL AND AMUSING HERSELF BY WATCHING MY STYLE OF ENCOURAGING THE FRUIT CANNING INDUSTRY I SLID OFF THE COUNTER AND DELIVERED UP MY SHOVEL TO UNCLE EMSLEY
8389-282920-0013 THE HOLY LAND I SAYS TO MYSELF MY THOUGHTS MILLING SOME AS I TRIED TO RUN EM INTO THE CORRAL WHY NOT THERE WAS SURE ANGELS IN PALES
8389-282920-0014 SO UNCLE EMSLEY TOOK ME OUT IN THE YARD AND GAVE US EACH OTHER'S ENTITLEMENTS I NEVER WAS SHY ABOUT WOMEN I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND WHY SOME MEN WHO CAN BREAK A MUSTANG BEFORE BREAKFAST AND SHAVE IN THE DARK
8389-282920-0015 GET ALL LEFT HANDED AND FULL OF PERSPIRATION AND EXCUSES WHEN THEY SEE A BOLD OF CALICO DRAPED AROUND WHAT BELONGS TO IT INSIDE OF EIGHT MINUTES ME AND MISS WILLELLA WAS AGGRAVATING THE CROQUET BALLS AROUND AS AMIABLE AS SECOND COUSINS
8389-282920-0016 SHE GAVE ME A DIG ABOUT THE QUANTITY OF CANNED FRUIT I HAD EATEN AND I GOT BACK AT HER FLAT FOOTED ABOUT HOW A CERTAIN LADY NAMED EVE STARTED THE FRUIT TROUBLE IN THE FIRST FREE GRASS PASTURE
8389-282920-0017 THAT WAS HOW I ACQUIRED CORDIALITY FOR THE PROXIMITIES OF MISS WILLELLA LEARIGHT AND THE DISPOSITION GREW LARGER AS TIME PASSED
8389-282920-0018 SHE WAS STOPPING AT PIMIENTA CROSSING FOR HER HEALTH WHICH WAS VERY GOOD AND FOR THE CLIMATE WHICH WAS FORTY PER CENT HOTTER THAN PALESTINE I RODE OVER TO SEE HER ONCE EVERY WEEK FOR A WHILE AND THEN I FIGURED IT OUT THAT IF I DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF TRIPS I WOULD SEE HER TWICE AS OFTEN
8389-282920-0019 ONE WEEK I SLIPPED IN A THIRD TRIP AND THAT'S WHERE THE PANCAKES AND THE PINK EYED SNOOZER BUSTED INTO THE GAME
8389-282920-0020 THAT EVENING WHILE I SET ON THE COUNTER WITH A PEACH AND TWO DAMSONS IN MY MOUTH I ASKED UNCLE EMSLEY HOW MISS WILLELLA WAS WHY SAYS UNCLE EMSLEY SHE'S GONE RIDING WITH JACKSON BIRD THE SHEEP MAN FROM OVER AT MIRED MULE CANADA
8389-282920-0021 I GUESS SOMEBODY HELD THE COUNTER BY THE BRIDLE WHILE I GOT OFF AND THEN I WALKED OUT STRAIGHT AHEAD TILL I BUTTED AGAINST THE MESQUITE WHERE MY ROAN WAS TIED

8389-282920-0024 I WENT OUT AND SAT ON THE GROUND IN THE SHADE OF THE STORE AND LEANED AGAINST A PRICKLY PEAR I SIFTED SAND INTO MY BOOTS WITH UNTHINKING HANDS WHILE I SOLILOQUISED A QUANTITY ABOUT THIS BIRD WITH THE JACKSON PLUMAGE TO HIS NAME
8389-282920-0025 I NEVER HAD BELIEVED IN HARMING SHEEP MEN I SEE ONE ONE DAY READING A LATIN GRAMMAR ON HOSSBACK AND I NEVER TOUCHED HIM THEY NEVER IRRITATED ME LIKE THEY DO MOST COWMEN
8389-282920-0026 I HAD ALWAYS LET EM PASS JUST AS YOU WOULD A JACK RABBIT WITH A POLITE WORD AND A GUESS ABOUT THE WEATHER BUT NO STOPPING TO SWAP CANTEENS I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO BE HOSTILE WITH A SNOOZER
8389-282920-0027 THE SHEEP PERSON HELPED HER OFF AND THEY STOOD THROWING EACH OTHER SENTENCES ALL SPRIGHTFUL AND SAGACIOUS FOR A WHILE
8389-282920-0028 AND THEN THIS FEATHERED JACKSON FLIES UP IN HIS SADDLE AND RAISES HIS LITTLE STEWPOT OF A HAT AND TROTS OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS MUTTON RANCH BY THIS TIME I HAD TURNED THE SAND OUT OF MY BOOTS AND UNPINNED MYSELF FROM THE PRICKLY PEAR
8389-282920-0029 HIS SEEING ARRANGEMENT WAS GREY ENOUGH BUT HIS EYE LASHES WAS PINK AND HIS HAIR WAS SANDY AND THAT GAVE YOU THE IDEA SHEEP MAN HE WASN'T MORE THAN A LAMB MAN ANYHOW
8389-282920-0030 A LITTLE THING WITH HIS NECK INVOLVED IN A YELLOW SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND SHOES TIED UP IN BOWKNOTS
8389-282920-0031 YOU NOW RIDE WITH A EQUESTRIAN WHO IS COMMONLY CALLED DEAD MORAL CERTAINTY JUDSON ON ACCOUNT OF THE WAY I SHOOT WHEN I WANT A STRANGER TO KNOW ME I ALWAYS INTRODUCE MYSELF BEFORE THE DRAW FOR I NEVER DID LIKE TO SHAKE HANDS WITH GHOSTS
