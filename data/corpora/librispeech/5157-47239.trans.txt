5157-47239-0009 WITHOUT MAKING UP FOR MY LOSSES UPON THE WHOLE THEN I DO NOT EXPECT TO GET MORE THAN THE NETT ANNUITY ABOVE MENTIONED AND THE EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS BUT UNLESS THAT IS GRANTED

5157-47239-0016 EIGHTEEN O ONE MY VERY DEAR LORD I WISH IT WAS IN MY POWER TO PROFIT OF YOUR KIND INVITATION
5157-47239-0017 AND WHICH I THOUGHT SURELY LOST ON BOARD THE COLOSSUS IT HAS COMFORTED ME MUCH WE REMAIN IN THE SAME CRUEL STATE WITH RESPECT TO THE KING'S RECOVERY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT BUT THAT HIS MAJESTY IS BETTER
5157-47239-0018 HOWEVER IF MY CONJECTURES ARE TRUE THE REGENCY MUST SOON TAKE PLACE AS IT MAY BE LONG BEFORE HIS MAJESTY COULD BE TROUBLED WITH BUSINESS SUPPOSING EVEN HIS FEVER TO HAVE TOTALLY SUBSIDED
5157-47239-0019 THE CERTAINTY OF THE FRENCH SQUADRON'S BEING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN GOD KNOWS HOW ALL THIS WILL END BUT I HOPE IT WILL BE YOUR LORDSHIP'S LOT TO BRING PAUL TO HIS SENSES GOD SEND YOU EVERY SUCCESS AND SEND YOU HOME
5157-47239-0020 SAFE AND WELL CROWNED WITH ADDITIONAL LAURELS AND THEN I HOPE YOU WILL REPOSE YOUR SHATTERED FRAME AND MAKE YOUR FRIENDS HAPPY BY STAYING WITH THEM
5157-47239-0021 BUT NOT QUITE FREE FROM BILE EVER MY DEAR LORD YOUR LORDSHIP'S MOST ATTACHED AND ETERNALLY OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT WM HAMILTON
5157-47239-0022 AND READ IN YOUR OWN HAND THAT GOD HAD NOT ONLY GRANTED YOU COMPLETE SUCCESS AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF OUR COUNTRY
5157-47239-0023 PREVENTED YOUR RECEIVING THE SMALLEST SCRATCH WE CAN ONLY REPEAT WHAT WE KNEW WELL AND OFTEN SAID BEFORE THAT NELSON WAS IS AND TO THE LAST WILL EVER BE THE FIRST HOWEVER
5157-47239-0024 WE ALL AGREE THAT WHEN WE GET YOU SAFE HOME ONCE MORE THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER MORE RISK YOUR SHATTERED FRAME YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH AND ARE WELL ENTITLED TO THE MOTTO OF VIRGIL
5157-47239-0025 THE FAMOUS BROUGHTON AFTER HE HAD BEATEN EVERY OPPONENT THAT DARED TO MEASURE HARD BLOWS WITH HIM SET UP AN ALE HOUSE THE BROUGHTON'S HEAD IN LONDON WITH THE ABOVE VERSE OF VIRGIL UNDER IT SOME YEARS AFTER
5157-47239-0026 HE WAS PERSUADED TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE OF A COACHMAN AND WAS BEATEN NOT THAT I MEAN TO CONVEY THAT ANY SUCH THING COULD HAPPEN TO YOUR LORDSHIP BUT YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH LET OTHERS FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLES
5157-47239-0027 THEY WILL BE REMEMBERED TO THE LATEST POSTERITY IT APPEARED TO ME MOST EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE SIXTH INST THE DATE OF YOUR LAST LETTER TO EMMA THE DEATH OF THE EMPEROR PAUL WHICH WE HAVE NO DOUBT OF HERE
5157-47239-0028 SHOULD NOT BE KNOWN AT COPENHAGEN IT APPEARS TO US THAT AS SOON AS THAT GREAT EVENT IS KNOWN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK
5157-47239-0029 THE FORMIDABLE GIANT NORTHERN COALITION WILL OF ITSELF FALL TO PIECES
5157-47239-0030 IN A VERY SHORT TIME YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED TO HAVE SEEN WHAT I SAW YESTERDAY EMMA DID NOT KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS ON HER HEAD OR HEELS IN SUCH A HURRY TO TELL YOUR GREAT NEWS
5157-47239-0031 THAT SHE COULD UTTER NOTHING BUT TEARS OF JOY AND TENDERNESS I WENT TO DAVISON YESTERDAY MORNING AND FOUND HIM STILL IN BED HAVING HAD A SEVERE FIT OF THE GOUT AND WITH YOUR LETTER WHICH HE HAD JUST RECEIVED AND HE CRIED LIKE A CHILD
5157-47239-0032 BUT WHAT WAS VERY EXTRAORDINARY ASSURED ME THAT FROM THE INSTANT HE HAD READ YOUR LETTER ALL PAIN HAD LEFT HIM AND THAT HE FELT HIMSELF ABLE TO GET UP AND WALK ABOUT YOUR BROTHER
5157-47239-0033 MISSUS NELSON AND HORACE DINED WITH US YOUR BROTHER WAS MORE EXTRAORDINARY THAN EVER HE WOULD GET UP SUDDENLY AND CUT A CAPER RUBBING HIS HANDS EVERY TIME THAT THE THOUGHT OF YOUR FRESH LAURELS CAME INTO HIS HEAD
5157-47239-0034 BUT I AM SURE THAT NO ONE REALLY REJOICED MORE AT HEART THAN I DID I HAVE LIVED TOO LONG TO HAVE EXTACIES BUT WITH CALM REFLECTION I FELT FOR MY FRIEND HAVING GOT TO THE VERY SUMMIT OF GLORY
5157-47239-0035 ENEMIES YOU HAVE NONE BUT THOSE THAT ARE BURSTING WITH ENVY AND SUCH ANIMALS INFEST ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD THE KING BE ASSURED IS THOUGH WEAK GETTING WELL FAST LORD LOUGHBOROUGH TOLD LIVINGSTON WHO HAS JUST BEEN HERE
5157-47239-0036 THAT HE WAS WITH THE KING THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BEFORE AND AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SEALS AND THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY CALM AND RECOLLECTED EVER YOUR SINCERELY ATTACHED AND TRULY OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT WM HAMILTON
5157-47239-0037 YOU HAVE ALREADY CALMED THE MINDS OF EVERY BODY WITH RESPECT TO THE THREATENED FRENCH INVASION IN SHORT ALL YOUR LORDSHIP DOES IS COMPLETE LIKE YOURSELF AND NOBODY ELSE
5157-47239-0038 BUT STILL I THINK THERE IS NO OCCASION FOR THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO EXPOSE HIS PERSON AS MUCH AS YOU DO WHY SHOULD YOU NOT HAVE A PRIVATE FLAG KNOWN TO YOUR FLEET AND NOT TO THE ENEMY WHEN YOU SHIFT IT AND GO RECONNOITRING
5157-47239-0039 CAPTAIN HOPKINS GOING FROM HENCE IN THE SPEEDWELL CUTTER TO JOIN YOUR LORDSHIP WILL BE HAPPY TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO YOU BY PRESENTING THIS LETTER HIMSELF THEY GIVE HIM A GOOD CHARACTER IN THIS COUNTRY
5157-47239-0040 BUT MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM IS BUT OF TWO DAYS I WAS YESTERDAY WITH CAPTAIN DOBBINS IN THE DILIGENCE CUTTER WE SAILED OUT OF THIS GLORIOUS HARBOUR AND THE DAY BEING FINE SAILED OUT SOME LEAGUES AND EXAMINED THE CROW ROCK
5157-47239-0041 WHICH IS RECKONED THE GREATEST DANGER AS TO ENTERING THE HARBOUR BUT THE TWO LIGHT HOUSES LATELY ERECTED TAKE OFF ALL DANGER IN THE NIGHT AND IT IS VISIBLE IN THE DAY TIME EXCEPT A SHORT TIME
5157-47239-0042 IN SPRING TIDES I AM DELIGHTED WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS AT MILFORD IT WILL SURELY BE A GREAT TOWN IF WE HAVE PEACE IN THREE YEARS THE HOUSES RISING UP LIKE MUSHROOMS EVEN IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES
5157-47239-0043 I VISITED THE TWO LIGHT HOUSES AND FOUND THEM PERFECTLY CLEAN AND IN GOOD ORDER
5157-47239-0044 AS I THINK IN THE MANNER YOU DISPATCH BUSINESS YOU WILL HAVE COMPLETED ALL BY WEDNESDAY NEXT THE DAY I SHALL PROBABLY BE IN LONDON CHARLES GREVILLE'S KIND COMPLIMENTS THE NAME OF NELSON IS IN EVERY MOUTH
5157-47239-0045 OR WHAT IS I BELIEVE OFTENER THE CASE BY THE IGNORANCE AND MISTAKES OF THE PHYSICIANS THEN INDEED THERE IS REASON TO LAMENT BUT AS IN THE CASE OF YOUR GOOD FATHER
5157-47239-0046 THE LAMP WAS SUFFERED TO BURN OUT FAIRLY AND THAT HIS SUFFERINGS WERE NOT GREAT AND THAT BY HIS SON'S GLORIOUS AND UNPARALLELED SUCCESSES HE SAW HIS FAMILY ENNOBLED AND WITH THE PROBABILITY IN TIME
5157-47239-0047 OF ITS BEING AMPLY REWARDED AS IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LONG AGO HIS MIND COULD NOT BE TROUBLED IN HIS LATTER MOMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILY HE LEFT BEHIND HIM AND AS TO HIS OWN PEACE OF MIND AT THE MOMENT OF HIS DISSOLUTION
5157-47239-0048 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AMONG THOSE WHO EVER HAD THE HONOUR OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE SAID MORE THAN I INTENDED BUT DARE SAY YOUR LORDSHIP HAD NEARLY THE SAME THOUGHTS WITH THE ADDITION OF THE FEELINGS OF A DUTIFUL SON
5157-47239-0049 FOR THE LOSS OF A MOST EXCELLENT FATHER IT IS HOWEVER NOW AS YOUR LORDSHIP IS THE FATHER OF YOUR FAMILY INCUMBENT UPON YOU TO TAKE PARTICULAR CARE OF YOUR OWN HEALTH
