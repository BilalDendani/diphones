5093-26496-0000 A SAD MISFORTUNE BEFELL HIS HOUSE ON THE OCCASION FOLLOWING HE HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS YET A VIRGIN AND VERY HANDSOME INSOMUCH THAT SHE SURPASSED ALL THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN HER NAME WAS TAMAR
5093-26496-0001 NAY HIS GRIEF SO EAT UP HIS BODY THAT HE GREW LEAN AND HIS COLOR WAS CHANGED NOW THERE WAS ONE JENADAB A KINSMAN AND FRIEND OF HIS WHO DISCOVERED THIS HIS PASSION
5093-26496-0002 AMNON CONFESSED HIS PASSION THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH A SISTER OF HIS WHO HAD THE SAME FATHER WITH HIMSELF SO JENADAB SUGGESTED TO HIM BY WHAT METHOD AND CONTRIVANCE HE MIGHT OBTAIN HIS DESIRES
5093-26496-0003 FOR HE PERSUADED HIM TO PRETEND SICKNESS AND BADE HIM WHEN HIS FATHER SHOULD COME TO HIM TO BEG OF HIM THAT HIS SISTER MIGHT COME AND MINISTER TO HIM FOR IF THAT WERE DONE HE SHOULD BE BETTER AND SHOULD QUICKLY RECOVER FROM HIS DISTEMPER
5093-26496-0004 AND FRY THEM IN A PAN AND DO IT ALL WITH HER OWN HANDS BECAUSE HE SHOULD TAKE THEM BETTER FROM HER HAND
5093-26496-0005 AND ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE HER TO LIE WITH HIM WHEREUPON THE DAMSEL CRIED OUT AND SAID NAY BROTHER DO NOT FORCE ME NOR BE SO WICKED AS TO TRANSGRESS THE LAWS AND BRING UPON THYSELF THE UTMOST CONFUSION
5093-26496-0006 AND WHILE IT WAS LIGHT THAT SHE MIGHT MEET WITH PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE WITNESSES OF HER SHAME HE COMMANDED HIS SERVANT TO TURN HER OUT OF HIS HOUSE WHEREUPON SHE WAS SORELY GRIEVED AT THE INJURY AND VIOLENCE THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HER
5093-26496-0007 AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HIM WHAT INJURY HAD BEEN OFFERED HER HE COMFORTED HER AND DESIRED HER TO BE QUIET AND TAKE ALL PATIENTLY AND NOT TO ESTEEM HER BEING CORRUPTED BY HER BROTHER AS AN INJURY
5093-26496-0008 AND DISCOVERING THE FORCE OFFERED HER TO THE MULTITUDE
5093-26496-0009 BUT BECAUSE HE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY AFFECTION FOR HIM FOR HE WAS HIS ELDEST SON HE WAS COMPELLED NOT TO AFFLICT HIM BUT ABSALOM WATCHED FOR A FIT OPPORTUNITY OF REVENGING THIS CRIME UPON HIM FOR HE THOROUGHLY HATED HIM
5093-26496-0010 THEN ABSALOM CHARGED HIS OWN SERVANTS THAT WHEN THEY SHOULD SEE AMNON DISORDERED AND DROWSY WITH WINE
5093-26496-0011 AND WERE AFRAID FOR THEMSELVES SO THEY IMMEDIATELY GOT ON HORSEBACK AND RODE AWAY TO THEIR FATHER BUT SOMEBODY THERE WAS WHO PREVENTED THEM AND TOLD THEIR FATHER THEY WERE ALL SLAIN BY ABSALOM WHEREUPON HE WAS OVERCOME WITH SORROW
5093-26496-0012 WHEN SO VERY GREAT AND BY THAT GREATNESS SO INCREDIBLE A MISFORTUNE WAS RELATED TO HIM HE RENT HIS CLOTHES AND THREW HIMSELF UPON THE GROUND AND THERE LAY LAMENTING THE LOSS OF ALL HIS SONS
5093-26496-0013 BOTH THOSE WHO AS HE WAS INFORMED WERE SLAIN AND OF HIM WHO SLEW THEM BUT JONADAB THE SON OF HIS BROTHER SHEMEAH ENTREATED HIM NOT TO INDULGE HIS SORROW SO FAR
5093-26496-0014 FOR AS TO THE REST OF HIS SONS HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE SLAIN FOR HE FOUND NO CAUSE FOR SUCH A SUSPICION
5093-26496-0015 FOR IT WAS NOT UNLIKELY THAT ABSALOM MIGHT VENTURE TO KILL HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THE INJURY HE HAD OFFERED TO TAMAR IN THE MEAN TIME A GREAT NOISE OF HORSES AND A TUMULT OF SOME PEOPLE THAT WERE COMING TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THEM
5093-26496-0016 THEY WERE THE KING'S SONS WHO WERE FLED AWAY FROM THE FEAST SO THEIR FATHER MET THEM AS THEY WERE IN THEIR GRIEF AND HE HIMSELF GRIEVED WITH THEM BUT IT WAS MORE THAN HE EXPECTED TO SEE THOSE HIS SONS AGAIN
5093-26496-0017 WHOM HE HAD A LITTLE BEFORE HEARD TO HAVE PERISHED HOWEVER THEIR WERE TEARS ON BOTH SIDES THEY LAMENTING THEIR BROTHER WHO WAS KILLED AND THE KING LAMENTING HIS SON WHO WAS KILLED ALSO
5093-26496-0018 AND THAT ONE WAS SMITTEN BY THE OTHER AND WAS DEAD AND SHE DESIRED HIM TO INTERPOSE IN THIS CASE AND TO DO HER THE FAVOR TO SAVE THIS HER SON FROM HER KINDRED WHO WERE VERY ZEALOUS TO HAVE HIM THAT HAD SLAIN HIS BROTHER PUT TO DEATH
5093-26496-0019 SHE MADE THIS REPLY TO HIM I OWE THEE THANKS FOR THY BENIGNITY TO ME IN PITYING MY OLD AGE AND PREVENTING THE LOSS OF MY ONLY REMAINING CHILD BUT IN ORDER TO ASSURE ME OF THIS THY KINDNESS
5093-26496-0020 BE FIRST RECONCILED TO THINE OWN SON AND CEASE TO BE ANGRY WITH HIM FOR HOW SHALL I PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THOU HAST REALLY BESTOWED THIS FAVOR UPON ME WHILE THOU THYSELF CONTINUEST AFTER THE LIKE MANNER IN THY WRATH TO THINE OWN SON
5093-26496-0021 FOR IT IS A FOOLISH THING TO ADD WILLFULLY ANOTHER TO THY DEAD SON WHILE THE DEATH OF THE OTHER WAS BROUGHT ABOUT WITHOUT THY CONSENT AND NOW THE KING PERCEIVED THAT THIS PRETENDED STORY WAS A SUBORNATION DERIVED FROM JOAB
5093-26496-0022 AND COMMANDED HIM TO RETIRE TO HIS OWN HOUSE FOR HE WAS NOT YET IN SUCH A DISPOSITION AS TO THINK FIT AT PRESENT TO SEE HIM ACCORDINGLY UPON THE FATHER'S COMMAND
5093-26496-0023 HE AVOIDED COMING INTO HIS PRESENCE AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THE RESPECTS PAID HIM BY HIS OWN FAMILY ONLY NOW HIS BEAUTY WAS NOT IMPAIRED EITHER BY THE GRIEF HE HAD BEEN UNDER
5093-26496-0024 HOWEVER HE DWELT IN JERUSALEM TWO YEARS AND BECAME THE FATHER OF THREE SONS AND ONE DAUGHTER WHICH DAUGHTER WAS OF VERY GREAT BEAUTY AND WHICH REHOBOAM THE SON OF SOLOMON TOOK TO WIFE AFTERWARD
