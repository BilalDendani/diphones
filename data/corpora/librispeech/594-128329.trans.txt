594-128329-0000 THEY HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME MANY HOURS WHEN HE PRESENTED HIMSELF HE WAS NOT IMPROVED IN HABITS OR IN LOOKS OR IN MANNER BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN RUGGED AIR OF FIDELITY ABOUT HIM WHICH WAS NEW TO THE OBSERVATION OF CHARLES DARNAY
594-128329-0001 HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING DARNAY ASIDE INTO A WINDOW AND OF SPEAKING TO HIM WHEN NO ONE OVERHEARD MISTER DARNAY SAID CARTON
594-128329-0002 YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY SO AS A FASHION OF SPEECH BUT I DON'T MEAN ANY FASHION OF SPEECH INDEED WHEN I SAY I WISH WE MIGHT BE FRIENDS I SCARCELY MEAN QUITE THAT EITHER
594-128329-0003 UPON MY LIFE SAID CARTON SMILING I FIND THAT EASIER TO COMPREHEND IN MY OWN MIND THAN TO CONVEY TO YOURS HOWEVER LET ME TRY YOU REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN I WAS MORE DRUNK THAN THAN USUAL
594-128329-0004 I REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN YOU FORCED ME TO CONFESS THAT YOU HAD BEEN DRINKING I REMEMBER IT TOO THE CURSE OF THOSE OCCASIONS IS HEAVY UPON ME FOR I ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM I HOPE IT MAY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ONE DAY WHEN ALL DAYS ARE AT AN END FOR ME
594-128329-0005 DON'T BE ALARMED I AM NOT GOING TO PREACH I AM NOT AT ALL ALARMED EARNESTNESS IN YOU IS ANYTHING BUT ALARMING TO ME AH SAID CARTON WITH A CARELESS WAVE OF HIS HAND AS IF HE WAVED THAT AWAY ON THE DRUNKEN OCCASION IN QUESTION
594-128329-0006 ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER AS YOU KNOW I WAS INSUFFERABLE ABOUT LIKING YOU AND NOT LIKING YOU I WISH YOU WOULD FORGET IT I FORGOT IT LONG AGO
594-128329-0007 BUT MISTER DARNAY OBLIVION IS NOT SO EASY TO ME AS YOU REPRESENT IT TO BE TO YOU I HAVE BY NO MEANS FORGOTTEN IT AND A LIGHT ANSWER DOES NOT HELP ME TO FORGET IT IF IT WAS A LIGHT ANSWER RETURNED DARNAY I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR IT
594-128329-0008 I HAD NO OTHER OBJECT THAN TO TURN A SLIGHT THING WHICH TO MY SURPRISE SEEMS TO TROUBLE YOU TOO MUCH ASIDE I DECLARE TO YOU ON THE FAITH OF A GENTLEMAN THAT I HAVE LONG DISMISSED IT FROM MY MIND GOOD HEAVEN WHAT WAS THERE TO DISMISS
594-128329-0009 AS TO THE GREAT SERVICE SAID CARTON
594-128329-0010 THAT IT WAS MERE PROFESSIONAL CLAPTRAP I DON'T KNOW THAT I CARED WHAT BECAME OF YOU WHEN I RENDERED IT MIND I SAY WHEN I RENDERED IT I AM SPEAKING OF THE PAST YOU MAKE LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION RETURNED DARNAY BUT I WILL NOT QUARREL WITH YOUR LIGHT ANSWER
594-128329-0011 GENUINE TRUTH MISTER DARNAY TRUST ME I HAVE GONE ASIDE FROM MY PURPOSE I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR BEING FRIENDS NOW YOU KNOW ME YOU KNOW I AM INCAPABLE OF ALL THE HIGHER AND BETTER FLIGHTS OF MEN IF YOU DOUBT IT ASK STRYVER AND HE'LL TELL YOU SO
594-128329-0012 BUT I DO AND YOU MUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT WELL IF YOU COULD ENDURE TO HAVE SUCH A WORTHLESS FELLOW AND A FELLOW OF SUCH INDIFFERENT REPUTATION COMING AND GOING AT ODD TIMES I SHOULD ASK THAT I MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME AND GO AS A PRIVILEGED PERSON HERE
594-128329-0013 THAT I MIGHT BE REGARDED AS AN USELESS AND I WOULD ADD IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE RESEMBLANCE I DETECTED BETWEEN YOU AND ME AN UNORNAMENTAL PIECE OF FURNITURE TOLERATED FOR ITS OLD SERVICE AND TAKEN NO NOTICE OF I DOUBT IF I SHOULD ABUSE THE PERMISSION
594-128329-0014 IT IS A HUNDRED TO ONE IF I SHOULD AVAIL MYSELF OF IT FOUR TIMES IN A YEAR IT WOULD SATISFY ME I DARE SAY TO KNOW THAT I HAD IT WILL YOU TRY THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT I AM PLACED ON THE FOOTING I HAVE INDICATED
594-128329-0015 I THANK YOU DARNAY I MAY USE THAT FREEDOM WITH YOUR NAME I THINK SO CARTON BY THIS TIME THEY SHOOK HANDS UPON IT AND SYDNEY TURNED AWAY
594-128329-0016 CHARLES DARNAY MADE SOME MENTION OF THIS CONVERSATION IN GENERAL TERMS AND SPOKE OF SYDNEY CARTON AS A PROBLEM OF CARELESSNESS AND RECKLESSNESS HE SPOKE OF HIM IN SHORT NOT BITTERLY OR MEANING TO BEAR HARD UPON HIM BUT AS ANYBODY MIGHT WHO SAW HIM AS HE SHOWED HIMSELF
594-128329-0017 HE HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS COULD DWELL IN THE THOUGHTS OF HIS FAIR YOUNG WIFE BUT WHEN HE AFTERWARDS JOINED HER IN THEIR OWN ROOMS HE FOUND HER WAITING FOR HIM WITH THE OLD PRETTY LIFTING OF THE FOREHEAD STRONGLY MARKED WE ARE THOUGHTFUL TO NIGHT SAID DARNAY DRAWING HIS ARM ABOUT HER
594-128329-0018 YES DEAREST CHARLES WITH HER HANDS ON HIS BREAST AND THE INQUIRING AND ATTENTIVE EXPRESSION FIXED UPON HIM WE ARE RATHER THOUGHTFUL TO NIGHT FOR WE HAVE SOMETHING ON OUR MIND TO NIGHT WHAT IS IT MY LUCIE
594-128329-0019 WILL YOU PROMISE NOT TO PRESS ONE QUESTION ON ME IF I BEG YOU NOT TO ASK IT WILL I PROMISE WHAT WILL I NOT PROMISE TO MY LOVE WHAT INDEED WITH HIS HAND PUTTING ASIDE THE GOLDEN HAIR FROM THE CHEEK
594-128329-0020 AND HIS OTHER HAND AGAINST THE HEART THAT BEAT FOR HIM I THINK CHARLES POOR MISTER CARTON DESERVES MORE CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT THAN YOU EXPRESSED FOR HIM TO NIGHT INDEED MY OWN WHY SO THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE NOT TO ASK ME
594-128329-0021 BUT I THINK I KNOW HE DOES IF YOU KNOW IT IT IS ENOUGH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO MY LIFE
594-128329-0022 ALWAYS AND VERY LENIENT ON HIS FAULTS WHEN HE IS NOT BY I WOULD ASK YOU TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS A HEART HE VERY VERY SELDOM REVEALS AND THAT THERE ARE DEEP WOUNDS IN IT MY DEAR I HAVE SEEN IT BLEEDING IT IS A PAINFUL REFLECTION TO ME
594-128329-0023 SAID CHARLES DARNAY QUITE ASTOUNDED THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE HIM ANY WRONG I NEVER THOUGHT THIS OF HIM MY HUSBAND IT IS SO I FEAR HE IS NOT TO BE RECLAIMED THERE IS SCARCELY A HOPE THAT ANYTHING IN HIS CHARACTER OR FORTUNES IS REPARABLE NOW
594-128329-0024 GENTLE THINGS EVEN MAGNANIMOUS THINGS SHE LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PURITY OF HER FAITH IN THIS LOST MAN THAT HER HUSBAND COULD HAVE LOOKED AT HER AS SHE WAS FOR HOURS AND O MY DEAREST LOVE SHE URGED
594-128329-0025 I WILL REMEMBER IT AS LONG AS I LIVE
594-128329-0026 IF ONE FORLORN WANDERER THEN PACING THE DARK STREETS COULD HAVE HEARD HER INNOCENT DISCLOSURE AND COULD HAVE SEEN THE DROPS OF PITY KISSED AWAY BY HER HUSBAND FROM THE SOFT BLUE EYES SO LOVING OF THAT HUSBAND HE MIGHT HAVE CRIED TO THE NIGHT
594-128329-0027 AND THE WORDS WOULD NOT HAVE PARTED FROM HIS LIPS FOR THE FIRST TIME
