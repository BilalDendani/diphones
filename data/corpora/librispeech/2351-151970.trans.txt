2351-151970-0000 IT WAS A COLD WET JANUARY DAY ON WHICH TOM WENT BACK TO SCHOOL A DAY QUITE IN KEEPING WITH THIS SEVERE PHASE OF HIS DESTINY IF HE HAD NOT CARRIED IN HIS POCKET A PARCEL OF SUGAR CANDY AND A SMALL DUTCH DOLL FOR LITTLE LAURA
2351-151970-0001 HE TOOK OUT THE PARCEL MADE A SMALL HOLE IN THE PAPER AND BIT OFF A CRYSTAL OR TWO WHICH HAD SO SOLACING AN EFFECT UNDER THE CONFINED PROSPECT AND DAMP ODORS OF THE GIG UMBRELLA
2351-151970-0002 THAT HE REPEATED THE PROCESS MORE THAN ONCE ON HIS WAY WELL TULLIVER WE'RE GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SAID MISTER STELLING HEARTILY TAKE OFF YOUR WRAPPINGS AND COME INTO THE STUDY TILL DINNER
2351-151970-0003 YOU'LL FIND A BRIGHT FIRE THERE AND A NEW COMPANION TOM FELT IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE FLUTTER AS HE TOOK OFF HIS WOOLLEN COMFORTER AND OTHER WRAPPINGS HE HAD SEEN PHILIP WAKEM AT SAINT OGG'S
2351-151970-0004 BUT HAD ALWAYS TURNED HIS EYES AWAY FROM HIM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE WOULD HAVE DISLIKED HAVING A DEFORMED BOY FOR HIS COMPANION EVEN IF PHILIP HAD NOT BEEN THE SON OF A BAD MAN AND TOM DID NOT SEE HOW A BAD MAN'S SON COULD BE VERY GOOD
2351-151970-0005 HIS OWN FATHER WAS A GOOD MAN AND HE WOULD READILY HAVE FOUGHT ANY ONE WHO SAID THE CONTRARY HE WAS IN A STATE OF MINGLED EMBARRASSMENT AND DEFIANCE AS HE FOLLOWED MISTER STELLING TO THE STUDY
2351-151970-0006 HERE IS A NEW COMPANION FOR YOU TO SHAKE HANDS WITH TULLIVER SAID THAT GENTLEMAN ON ENTERING THE STUDY MASTER PHILIP WAKEM I SHALL LEAVE YOU TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE BY YOURSELVES
2351-151970-0007 AND HE WAS NOT PREPARED TO SAY HOW DO YOU DO ON SO SHORT A NOTICE MISTER STELLING WISELY TURNED AWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM BOYS SHYNESS ONLY WEARS OFF IN THE ABSENCE OF THEIR ELDERS
2351-151970-0008 PHILIP WAS AT ONCE TOO PROUD AND TOO TIMID TO WALK TOWARD TOM HE THOUGHT OR RATHER FELT THAT TOM HAD AN AVERSION TO LOOKING AT HIM EVERY ONE ALMOST DISLIKED LOOKING AT HIM
2351-151970-0009 AND AS HE DREW WAS THINKING WHAT HE COULD SAY TO TOM AND TRYING TO OVERCOME HIS OWN REPUGNANCE TO MAKING THE FIRST ADVANCES TOM BEGAN TO LOOK OFTENER AND LONGER AT PHILIP'S FACE
2351-151970-0010 FOR HE COULD SEE IT WITHOUT NOTICING THE HUMP AND IT WAS REALLY NOT A DISAGREEABLE FACE VERY OLD LOOKING TOM THOUGHT HE WONDERED HOW MUCH OLDER PHILIP WAS THAN HIMSELF AN ANATOMIST EVEN A MERE PHYSIOGNOMIST
2351-151970-0011 WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT THE DEFORMITY OF PHILIP'S SPINE WAS NOT A CONGENITAL HUMP BUT THE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT IN INFANCY BUT YOU DO NOT EXPECT FROM TOM ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH SUCH DISTINCTIONS
2351-151970-0012 TO HIM PHILIP WAS SIMPLY A HUMPBACK HE HAD A VAGUE NOTION THAT THE DEFORMITY OF WAKEM'S SON HAD SOME RELATION TO THE LAWYER'S RASCALITY OF WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD HIS FATHER TALK WITH HOT EMPHASIS
2351-151970-0013 THERE WAS A HUMPBACKED TAILOR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MISTER JACOBS'S ACADEMY WHO WAS CONSIDERED A VERY UNAMIABLE CHARACTER AND WAS MUCH HOOTED AFTER BY PUBLIC SPIRITED BOYS
2351-151970-0014 SOLELY ON THE GROUND OF HIS UNSATISFACTORY MORAL QUALITIES SO THAT TOM WAS NOT WITHOUT A BASIS OF FACT TO GO UPON STILL NO FACE COULD BE MORE UNLIKE THAT UGLY TAILOR'S THAN THIS MELANCHOLY BOY'S FACE
2351-151970-0015 BUT HE HANDLED HIS PENCIL IN AN ENVIABLE MANNER AND WAS APPARENTLY MAKING ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE WHAT WAS HE DRAWING TOM WAS QUITE WARM NOW AND WANTED SOMETHING NEW TO BE GOING FORWARD IT WAS CERTAINLY MORE AGREEABLE
2351-151970-0016 TO HAVE AN ILL NATURED HUMPBACK AS A COMPANION THAN TO STAND LOOKING OUT OF THE STUDY WINDOW AT THE RAIN AND KICKING HIS FOOT AGAINST THE WASHBOARD IN SOLITUDE SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN EVERY DAY A QUARREL OR SOMETHING AND TOM THOUGHT HE SHOULD RATHER LIKE TO SHOW PHILIP
2351-151970-0017 HE SUDDENLY WALKED ACROSS THE HEARTH AND LOOKED OVER PHILIP'S PAPER WHY THAT'S A DONKEY WITH PANNIERS AND A SPANIEL AND PARTRIDGES IN THE CORN HE EXCLAIMED HIS TONGUE BEING COMPLETELY LOOSED BY SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION
2351-151970-0018 OH MY BUTTONS I WISH I COULD DRAW LIKE THAT I'M TO LEARN DRAWING THIS HALF I WONDER IF I SHALL LEARN TO MAKE DOGS AND DONKEYS OH YOU CAN DO THEM WITHOUT LEARNING SAID PHILIP I NEVER LEARNED DRAWING
2351-151970-0019 NEVER LEARNED SAID TOM IN AMAZEMENT WHY WHEN I MAKE DOGS AND HORSES AND THOSE THINGS THE HEADS AND THE LEGS WON'T COME RIGHT THOUGH I CAN SEE HOW THEY OUGHT TO BE VERY WELL I CAN MAKE HOUSES AND ALL SORTS OF CHIMNEYS
2351-151970-0020 AND WINDOWS IN THE ROOF AND ALL THAT BUT I DARE SAY I COULD DO DOGS AND HORSES IF I WAS TO TRY MORE HE ADDED REFLECTING THAT PHILIP MIGHT FALSELY SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS GOING TO KNOCK UNDER IF HE WERE TOO FRANK ABOUT THE IMPERFECTION OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS
2351-151970-0021 OH YES SAID PHILIP IT'S VERY EASY YOU'VE ONLY TO LOOK WELL AT THINGS AND DRAW THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT YOU DO WRONG ONCE YOU CAN ALTER THE NEXT TIME
2351-151970-0022 SAID TOM BEGINNING TO HAVE A PUZZLED SUSPICION THAT PHILIP'S CROOKED BACK MIGHT BE THE SOURCE OF REMARKABLE FACULTIES I THOUGHT YOU'D BEEN TO SCHOOL A LONG WHILE YES SAID PHILIP SMILING
2351-151970-0023 I DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT IT SAID PHILIP AH BUT PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO THE PROPRIA QUAE MARIBUS SAID TOM NODDING HIS HEAD SIDEWAYS AS MUCH AS TO SAY
2351-151970-0024 ACTIVE LOOKING BOY BUT MADE POLITE BY HIS OWN EXTREME SENSITIVENESS AS WELL AS BY HIS DESIRE TO CONCILIATE HE CHECKED HIS INCLINATION TO LAUGH AND SAID QUIETLY I'VE DONE WITH THE GRAMMAR I DON'T LEARN THAT ANY MORE
2351-151970-0025 THEN YOU WON'T HAVE THE SAME LESSONS AS I SHALL SAID TOM WITH A SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT NO BUT I DARE SAY I CAN HELP YOU I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO HELP YOU IF I CAN TOM DID NOT SAY THANK YOU
2351-151970-0026 FOR HE WAS QUITE ABSORBED IN THE THOUGHT THAT WAKEM'S SON DID NOT SEEM SO SPITEFUL A FELLOW AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED I SAY HE SAID PRESENTLY DO YOU LOVE YOUR FATHER YES SAID PHILIP COLORING DEEPLY DON'T YOU LOVE YOURS
2351-151970-0027 OH YES I ONLY WANTED TO KNOW SAID TOM RATHER ASHAMED OF HIMSELF NOW HE SAW PHILIP COLORING AND LOOKING UNCOMFORTABLE
2351-151970-0028 AND IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF PHILIP DISLIKED HIS FATHER THAT FACT MIGHT GO SOME WAY TOWARD CLEARING UP HIS PERPLEXITY SHALL YOU LEARN DRAWING NOW HE SAID BY WAY OF CHANGING THE SUBJECT NO SAID PHILIP
2351-151970-0029 MY FATHER WISHES ME TO GIVE ALL MY TIME TO OTHER THINGS NOW WHAT LATIN AND EUCLID AND THOSE THINGS SAID TOM YES SAID PHILIP WHO HAD LEFT OFF USING HIS PENCIL AND WAS RESTING HIS HEAD ON ONE HAND WHILE TOM WAS LEARNING FORWARD ON BOTH ELBOWS
2351-151970-0030 AND LOOKING WITH INCREASING ADMIRATION AT THE DOG AND THE DONKEY AND YOU DON'T MIND THAT SAID TOM WITH STRONG CURIOSITY NO I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE KNOWS I CAN STUDY WHAT I LIKE BY AND BY
2351-151970-0031 I CAN'T THINK WHY ANYBODY SHOULD LEARN LATIN SAID TOM IT'S NO GOOD IT'S PART OF THE EDUCATION OF A GENTLEMAN SAID PHILIP ALL GENTLEMEN LEARN THE SAME THINGS WHAT DO YOU THINK SIR JOHN CRAKE
2351-151970-0032 WHO HAD OFTEN THOUGHT HE SHOULD LIKE TO RESEMBLE SIR JOHN CRAKE HE LEARNED IT WHEN HE WAS A BOY OF COURSE SAID PHILIP BUT I DARE SAY HE'S FORGOTTEN IT OH WELL I CAN DO THAT THEN SAID TOM NOT WITH ANY EPIGRAMMATIC INTENTION
2351-151970-0033 BUT WITH SERIOUS SATISFACTION AT THE IDEA THAT AS FAR AS LATIN WAS CONCERNED THERE WAS NO HINDRANCE TO HIS RESEMBLING SIR JOHN CRAKE ONLY YOU'RE OBLIGED TO REMEMBER IT WHILE YOU'RE AT SCHOOL ELSE YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN EVER SO MANY LINES OF SPEAKER
2351-151970-0034 MISTER STELLING'S VERY PARTICULAR DID YOU KNOW
2351-151970-0035 OH I DON'T MIND SAID PHILIP UNABLE TO CHOKE A LAUGH I CAN REMEMBER THINGS EASILY AND THERE ARE SOME LESSONS I'M VERY FOND OF I'M VERY FOND OF GREEK HISTORY AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GREEKS I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN A GREEK
2351-151970-0036 AND FOUGHT THE PERSIANS AND THEN HAVE COME HOME AND HAVE WRITTEN TRAGEDIES OR ELSE HAVE BEEN LISTENED TO BY EVERYBODY FOR MY WISDOM LIKE SOCRATES AND HAVE DIED A GRAND DEATH
