5147-32137-0000 WHAT WOULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN THAT THESE ADVENTUROUS NAVIGATORS PASSING AROUND THE SHORES OF THE GULF SHOULD SOONER OR LATER DISCOVER THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND WHAT MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT THEY WOULD ENTER IT EXPLORE IT AND PLANT COLONIES ALONG ITS SHORES WHEREVER THEY FOUND A FERTILE SOIL AND A SALUBRIOUS CLIMATE
5147-32137-0001 THE RESULTS WE HAVE PRESUPPOSED ARE PRECISELY THOSE WHICH WE FIND TO HAVE EXISTED AT ONE TIME IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THE MOUND BUILDERS OF THE UNITED STATES WERE PRE EMINENTLY A RIVER PEOPLE
5147-32137-0002 THEIR DENSEST SETTLEMENTS AND GREATEST WORKS WERE NEAR THE MISSISSIPPI AND ITS TRIBUTARIES SAYS FOSTER
5147-32137-0003 NAVIGABLE STREAMS WERE THE GREAT HIGHWAYS OF THE MOUND BUILDERS MISTER FONTAINE CLAIMS
5147-32137-0004 THAT THIS ANCIENT PEOPLE CONSTRUCTED LEVEES TO CONTROL AND UTILIZE THE BAYOUS OF THE MISSISSIPPI FOR THE PURPOSE OF AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE THE YAZOO RIVER IS CALLED YAZOO OKHINNAH THE RIVER OF ANCIENT RUINS
5147-32137-0005 THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CIVILIZATION OF THIS PEOPLE ADVANCED UP THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND SPREAD OUT OVER ITS TRIBUTARIES BUT DID NOT CROSS THE ALLEGHANY
5147-32137-0006 THE HEAD WATERS OF THE MISSOURI BECAME ONE OF THEIR GREAT CENTRES OF POPULATION BUT THEIR CHIEF SITES WERE UPON THE MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO RIVERS IN WISCONSIN WE FIND THE NORTHERN CENTRAL LIMIT OF THEIR WORK THEY SEEM TO HAVE OCCUPIED THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF THE STATE AND THE WESTERN SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN
5147-32137-0007 THEIR CIRCULAR MOUNDS ARE FOUND IN MINNESOTA AND IOWA AND SOME VERY LARGE ONES IN DAKOTA ILLINOIS AND INDIANA WERE DENSELY POPULATED BY THEM IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE VITAL CENTRE OF THEIR COLONIES WAS NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THE OHIO AND MISSISSIPPI RIVERS
5147-32137-0008 THEIR MOUNDS WERE NOT CONES BUT FOUR SIDED PYRAMIDS
5147-32137-0009 AT HOPETOWN OHIO ARE TWO WALLED FIGURES ONE A SQUARE THE OTHER A CIRCLE EACH CONTAINING PRECISELY TWENTY ACRES
5147-32137-0010 SO THAT THE SPACE ENCLOSED BY EACH MIGHT EXACTLY CORRESPOND
5147-32137-0011 COPPER IMPLEMENTS ARE VERY NUMEROUS IN THE MOUNDS COPPER AXES SPEAR HEADS HOLLOW BUTTONS BOSSES FOR ORNAMENTS BRACELETS RINGS ET CETERA ARE FOUND IN VERY MANY OF THEM STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE BRONZE AGE IN EUROPE IN ONE IN BUTLER COUNTY OHIO
5147-32137-0012 PRESENTING AN UNBROKEN METALLIC LUSTRE THE OVERLAPPING EDGES SO WELL POLISHED AS TO BE SCARCELY DISCOVERABLE BEADS AND STARS MADE OF SHELLS HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN FOUND DOUBLY PLATED FIRST WITH COPPER THEN WITH SILVER
5147-32137-0013 A RUDE ARTICLE IN THE SHAPE OF AN AXE COMPOSED OF PURE LEAD WEIGHING ABOUT HALF A POUND WAS FOUND IN SINKING A WELL WITHIN THE TRENCH OF THE ANCIENT WORKS AT CIRCLEVILLE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT IT WAS THE PRODUCTION OF THE MOUND BUILDERS AS GALENA HAS OFTEN BEEN FOUND ON THE ALTARS IN THE MOUNDS
5147-32137-0014 IT HAS BEEN GENERALLY THOUGHT BY MISTER SQUIER AND OTHERS THAT THERE WERE NO EVIDENCES THAT THE MOUND BUILDERS WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE USE OF IRON OR THAT THEIR PLATING WAS MORE THAN A SIMPLE OVERLAYING OF ONE METAL ON ANOTHER OR ON SOME FOREIGN SUBSTANCE SOME YEARS SINCE HOWEVER
5147-32137-0015 OR ORNAMENTS FOR A SWORD BELT OR BUCKLER THEY ARE COMPOSED OF COPPER OVERLAID WITH A THICK PLATE OF SILVER THE FRONTS ARE SLIGHTLY CONVEX WITH A DEPRESSION LIKE A CUP IN THE CENTRE AND THEY MEASURE TWO INCHES AND A QUARTER ACROSS THE FACE OF EACH
5147-32137-0016 IT IS SIX INCHES IN LENGTH TWO IN BREADTH AND WEIGHS ONE OUNCE
5147-32137-0017 TWO OR THREE PIECES OF COPPER TUBE WERE ALSO FOUND FILLED WITH IRON RUST THESE PIECES FROM THEIR APPEARANCE COMPOSED THE LOWER END OF THE SCABBARD NEAR THE POINT OF THE SWORD
5147-32137-0018 THE MOUND HAD EVERY APPEARANCE OF BEING AS OLD AS ANY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WAS AT THE FIRST SETTLEMENT OF MARIETTA COVERED WITH LARGE TREES
5147-32137-0019 AS THIS SKELETON ALONE WAS DISCOVERED THE BONES WERE VERY MUCH DECAYED AND MANY OF THEM CRUMBLED TO DUST UPON EXPOSURE TO THE AIR
5147-32137-0020 THESE ARTICLES HAVE BEEN CRITICALLY EXAMINED AND IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THAT THE COPPER BOSSES WERE ABSOLUTELY PLATED NOT SIMPLY OVERLAID WITH SILVER BETWEEN THE COPPER AND THE SILVER EXISTS A CONNECTION SUCH AS IT SEEMS TO ME COULD ONLY BE PRODUCED BY HEAT
5147-32137-0021 AND IF IT IS ADMITTED THAT THESE ARE GENUINE RELICS OF THE MOUND BUILDERS IT MUST AT THE SAME TIME BE ADMITTED THAT THEY POSSESSED THE DIFFICULT ART OF PLATING ONE METAL UPON ANOTHER THERE IS BUT ONE ALTERNATIVE VIZ THAT THEY HAD OCCASIONAL OR CONSTANT INTERCOURSE WITH A PEOPLE ADVANCED IN THE ARTS
5147-32137-0022 FROM WHOM THESE ARTICLES WERE OBTAINED AGAIN IF DOCTOR HILDRETH IS NOT MISTAKEN OXYDIZED IRON OR STEEL WAS ALSO DISCOVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ABOVE REMAINS FROM WHICH ALSO FOLLOWS THE EXTRAORDINARY CONCLUSION THAT THE MOUND BUILDERS WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE USE OF IRON
5147-32137-0023 THE CONCLUSION BEING OF COURSE SUBJECT TO THE IMPROBABLE ALTERNATIVE ALREADY MENTIONED
5147-32137-0024 THERE WERE FOUND DEEP EXCAVATIONS WITH RUDE LADDERS HUGE MASSES OF ROCK BROKEN OFF ALSO NUMEROUS STONE TOOLS AND ALL THE EVIDENCES OF EXTENSIVE AND LONG CONTINUED LABOR IT IS EVEN SAID THAT THE GREAT ONTONAGON MASS OF PURE COPPER WHICH IS NOW IN WASHINGTON WAS EXCAVATED BY THESE ANCIENT MINERS
5147-32137-0025 AND THAT WHEN FIRST FOUND ITS SURFACE SHOWED NUMEROUS MARKS OF THEIR TOOLS
5147-32137-0026 THEY POSSESSED VARIOUS MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES THEY WERE VERY PROBABLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE LATHE
5147-32137-0027 IN A MOUND ON THE SCIOTO RIVER WAS FOUND AROUND THE NECK OF A SKELETON TRIPLE ROWS OF BEADS MADE OF MARINE SHELLS AND THE TUSKS OF SOME ANIMAL SEVERAL OF THESE SAYS SQUIER
5147-32137-0028 STILL RETAIN THEIR POLISH AND BEAR MARKS WHICH SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THEY WERE TURNED IN SOME MACHINE INSTEAD OF BEING CARVED OR RUBBED INTO SHAPE BY HAND NOT AMONG THE LEAST INTERESTING AND REMARKABLE RELICS CONTINUES THE SAME AUTHOR
5147-32137-0029 OBTAINED FROM THE MOUNDS ARE THE STONE TUBES THEY ARE ALL CARVED FROM FINE GRAINED MATERIALS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING A POLISH AND BEING MADE ORNAMENTAL AS WELL AS USEFUL
5147-32137-0030 WAS FOUND IN A MOUND IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF CHILLICOTHE IT IS COMPOSED OF A COMPACT VARIETY OF SLATE THIS STONE CUTS WITH GREAT CLEARNESS AND RECEIVES A FINE THOUGH NOT GLARING POLISH
5147-32137-0031 AND THE OTHER TERMINATES IN A BROAD FLATTENED TRIANGULAR MOUTH PIECE OF FINE PROPORTIONS WHICH IS CARVED WITH MATHEMATICAL PRECISION IT IS DRILLED THROUGHOUT THE BORE IS SEVEN TENTHS OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AT THE CYLINDRICAL END OF THE TUBE AND RETAINS THAT CALIBRE UNTIL IT REACHES THE POINT WHERE THE CYLINDER
5147-32137-0032 SUBSIDES INTO THE MOUTH PIECE WHEN IT CONTRACTS GRADUALLY TO ONE TENTH OF AN INCH THE INNER SURFACE OF THE TUBE IS PERFECTLY SMOOTH TILL WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE POINT OF CONTRACTION
5147-32137-0033 WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT SOME OF THEIR PORPHYRY CARVINGS WILL TURN THE EDGE OF THE BEST TEMPERED KNIFE WE ARE FORCED TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY POSSESSED THAT SINGULAR PROCESS KNOWN TO THE MEXICANS AND PERUVIANS OF TEMPERING COPPER TO THE HARDNESS OF STEEL
5147-32137-0034 WE FIND IN THE MOUNDS ADZES SIMILAR IN SHAPE TO OUR OWN WITH THE EDGES BEVELLED FROM THE INSIDE DRILLS AND GRAVERS OF COPPER HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND WITH CHISEL SHAPED EDGES OR SHARP POINTS IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE SAYS SQUIER
5147-32137-0035 BUT ON THE CONTRARY VERY PROBABLE FROM A CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE MOUND POTTERY THAT THE ANCIENT PEOPLE POSSESSED THE SIMPLE APPROXIMATION TOWARD THE POTTER'S WHEEL AND THE POLISH WHICH SOME OF THE FINER VESSELS POSSESS IS DUE TO OTHER CAUSES THAN VITRIFICATION
5147-32137-0036 THEY CONSIST OF FIGURES OF BIRDS ANIMALS REPTILES AND THE FACES OF MEN CARVED FROM VARIOUS KINDS OF STONES UPON THE BOWLS OF PIPES UPON TOYS UPON RINGS AND IN DISTINCT AND SEPARATE FIGURES WE GIVE THE OPINIONS OF THOSE WHO HAVE EXAMINED THEM MISTER SQUIER OBSERVES
5147-32137-0037 THE BOWLS OF MOST OF THE STONE PIPES ARE CARVED IN MINIATURE FIGURES OF ANIMALS BIRDS REPTILES ET CETERA ALL OF THEM ARE EXECUTED WITH STRICT FIDELITY TO NATURE AND WITH EXQUISITE SKILL NOT ONLY ARE THE FEATURES OF THE OBJECTS FAITHFULLY REPRESENTED
5147-32137-0038 AMONG THEIR SCULPTURES IN OHIO WE FIND ACCURATE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE LAMANTINE MANATEE OR SEA COW FOUND TO DAY ON THE SHORES OF FLORIDA BRAZIL AND CENTRAL AMERICA AND OF THE TOUCAN A TROPICAL AND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY SOUTH AMERICAN BIRD
5147-32137-0039 SEA SHELLS FROM THE GULF PEARLS FROM THE ATLANTIC AND OBSIDIAN FROM MEXICO HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND SIDE BY SIDE IN THEIR MOUNDS THE ANTIQUITY OF THEIR WORKS IS NOW GENERALLY CONCEDED FROM THE RUINS OF NINEVEH AND BABYLON SAYS MISTER GLIDDON
5147-32137-0040 IN PERFECT PRESERVATION NEVERTHELESS THE SKELETONS DEPOSITED IN OUR INDIAN MOUNDS FROM THE LAKES TO THE GULF ARE CRUMBLING INTO DUST THROUGH AGE ALONE ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT CIVILIZED OR SEMI CIVILIZED MAN HAS DWELT ON THE WESTERN CONTINENT FROM A VAST ANTIQUITY
5147-32137-0041 MAIZE TOBACCO QUINOA AND THE MANDICO PLANTS HAVE BEEN CULTIVATED SO LONG THAT THEIR WILD ORIGINALS HAVE QUITE DISAPPEARED
5147-32137-0042 ALLUDING TO THE ABOVE NAMED PLANTS DOCTOR BRINTON
5147-32137-0043 REMARKS SEVERAL ARE SURE TO PERISH UNLESS FOSTERED BY HUMAN CARE WHAT NUMBERLESS AGES DOES THIS SUGGEST HOW MANY CENTURIES ELAPSED ERE MAN THOUGHT OF CULTIVATING INDIAN CORN HOW MANY MORE ERE IT HAD SPREAD OVER NEARLY A HUNDRED DEGREES OF LATITUDE AND LOST ALL RESEMBLANCE TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM
5147-32137-0044 IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM CERTAIN ANIMALS WERE DOMESTICATED BY THE ABORIGINES FROM SO REMOTE A PERIOD THAT SCARCELY ANY OF THEIR SPECIES AS IN THE CASE OF THE LAMA OF PERU WERE TO BE FOUND IN A STATE OF UNRESTRAINED FREEDOM AT THE ADVENT OF THE SPANIARDS
5147-32137-0045 SHORT'S NORTH AMERICANS OF ANTIQUITY
5147-32137-0046 MOST ANCIENT REMAINS OF MAN FOUND IN EUROPE ARE DISTINGUISHED BY A FLATTENING OF THE TIBIA AND THIS PECULIARITY IS FOUND TO BE PRESENT IN AN EXAGGERATED FORM IN SOME OF THE AMERICAN MOUNDS
5147-32137-0047 AND AS THERE IS NO GOOD REASON WHY THEIR BUILDERS SHOULD HAVE AVOIDED ERECTING THEM ON THAT TERRACE WHILE THEY RAISED THEM PROMISCUOUSLY ON ALL THE OTHERS IT FOLLOWS NOT UNREASONABLY
5147-32137-0048 THEY CALLED THE REGION THEY LEFT IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
5147-32137-0049 IN ALLUSION PROBABLY TO THE RED CLAY SOIL OF PART OF THE COUNTRY IN THE MOUNDS WE FIND MANY WORKS OF COPPER BUT NONE OF BRONZE
5147-32137-0050 BY MIXING ONE PART OF TIN WITH NINE PARTS OF COPPER OR WHICH IS MORE PROBABLE THE MANUFACTURES OF THE MOUND BUILDERS MAY HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPOT AND AS THEY HAD NO TIN WITHIN THEIR TERRITORY THEY USED COPPER ALONE EXCEPT IT MAY BE FOR SUCH TOOLS AS WERE NEEDED TO CARVE STONE AND THESE PERHAPS WERE HARDENED WITH TIN
5147-32137-0051 IT IS KNOWN THAT THE MEXICANS POSSESSED THE ART OF MANUFACTURING TRUE BRONZE AND THE INTERCOURSE WHICH EVIDENTLY EXISTED BETWEEN MEXICO AND THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AS PROVED BY THE PRESENCE OF IMPLEMENTS OF OBSIDIAN IN THE MOUNDS OF OHIO RENDERS IT PROBABLE THAT THE SAME COMMERCE WHICH BROUGHT THEM OBSIDIAN BROUGHT THEM ALSO SMALL QUANTITIES OF TIN
5147-32137-0052 OR TIN HARDENED COPPER IMPLEMENTS NECESSARY FOR THEIR SCULPTURES THE PROOFS THEN OF THE CONNECTION OF THE MOUND BUILDERS WITH ATLANTIS ARE ONE THEIR RACE IDENTITY WITH THE NATIONS OF CENTRAL AMERICA WHO POSSESSED FLOOD LEGENDS AND WHOSE TRADITIONS ALL POINT TO AN EASTERN
5147-32137-0053 TWO THE SIMILARITY OF THEIR CIVILIZATION AND THEIR WORKS OF STONE AND BRONZE WITH THE CIVILIZATION OF THE BRONZE AGE IN EUROPE THREE THE PRESENCE OF GREAT TRUNCATED MOUNDS KINDRED TO THE PYRAMIDS OF CENTRAL AMERICA MEXICO EGYPT AND INDIA
5147-32137-0054 FOUR THE REPRESENTATION OF TROPICAL ANIMALS WHICH POINT TO AN INTERCOURSE WITH THE REGIONS AROUND THE GULF OF MEXICO WHERE THE ATLANTEANS WERE COLONIZED FIVE
