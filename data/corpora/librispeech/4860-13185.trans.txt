4860-13185-0000 THE ISLE OF BLASTED HOPES THERE IS A LARGE ISLAND WHERE THE NINETY MILE BEACH ENDS IN A WILDERNESS OF ROARING BREAKERS IT IS THE ISLE OF BLASTED HOPES
4860-13185-0001 ITS ENCHANTING LANDSCAPE HAS ALLURED MANY A LANDSMAN TO HIS RUIN AND ITS BEACON SEEN THROUGH THE HAZE OF A SOUTH EAST GALE HAS GUIDED MANY A WATCHFUL MARINER TO SHIPWRECK AND DEATH AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF GIPPSLAND
4860-13185-0002 PEARSON AND BLACK FIRST OCCUPIED THE ISLAND UNDER A GRAZING LICENSE AND THEY PUT ELEVEN THOUSAND SHEEP ON IT WITH SOME HORSES BULLOCKS AND PIGS THE SHEEP BEGAN TO DIE SO THEY SOLD THEM TO CAPTAIN COLE AT TEN SHILLINGS A HEAD GIVING IN THE OTHER STOCK
4860-13185-0003 THEY WERE OF THE OPINION THAT THEY HAD MADE AN EXCELLENT BARGAIN BUT WHEN THE MUSTER WAS MADE NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED OF THE SHEEP WERE MISSING THE PIGS RAN WILD BUT MULTIPLIED WHEN THE LAST SHEEP HAD PERISHED COLE SOLD HIS LICENSE TO A MAN NAMED THOMAS
4860-13185-0004 WHO PUT ON MORE SHEEP AND AFTERWARDS EXCHANGED AS MANY AS HE COULD FIND WITH JOHN KING FOR CATTLE AND HORSES MORRISON NEXT OCCUPIED THE ISLAND UNTIL HE WAS STARVED OUT THEN ANOTHER MAN NAMED THOMAS TOOK THE FATAL GRAZING LICENSE
4860-13185-0005 BUT HE DID NOT LIVE ON THE LAND HE PLACED HIS BROTHER IN CHARGE OF IT TO BE OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION AS HE WAS TOO FOND OF LIQUOR THE BROTHER WAS NOT ALLOWED THE USE OF A BOAT HE WITH HIS WIFE AND FAMILY WAS VIRTUALLY A PRISONER
4860-13185-0006 CONDEMNED TO SOBRIETY BUT BY THIS TIME A LIGHTHOUSE HAD BEEN ERECTED AND WATTS THE KEEPER OF IT HAD A BOAT AND WAS MOREOVER FOND OF LIQUOR THE TWO MEN SOON BECAME FIRM FRIENDS AND OFTEN FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE VOYAGES TO PORT ALBERT FOR FLOUR
4860-13185-0007 OR TEA OR SUGAR THE LAST TIME THEY SAILED TOGETHER THE BAROMETER WAS LOW AND A GALE WAS BREWING WHEN THEY LEFT THE WHARF THEY HAD TAKEN ON BOARD ALL THE STORES THEY REQUIRED AND MORE THEY WERE HAPPY AND GLORIOUS
4860-13185-0008 NEXT DAY THE MASTHEAD OF THEIR BOAT WAS SEEN STICKING OUT OF THE WATER NEAR SUNDAY ISLAND THE PILOT SCHOONER WENT DOWN AND HAULED THE BOAT TO THE SURFACE BUT NOTHING WAS FOUND IN HER EXCEPT THE SAND BALLAST AND A BOTTLE OF RUM
4860-13185-0009 HER SHEET WAS MADE FAST AND WHEN THE SQUALL STRUCK HER SHE HAD GONE DOWN LIKE A STONE THE ISLE OF BLASTED HOPES WAS USELESS EVEN AS AN ASYLUM FOR INEBRIATES THE ECLIPTIC WAS CARRYING COALS FROM NEWCASTLE THE TIME WAS MIDNIGHT
4860-13185-0010 THE SKY WAS MISTY AND THE GALE WAS FROM THE SOUTH EAST WHEN THE WATCH REPORTED A LIGHT AHEAD THE CABIN BOY WAS STANDING ON DECK NEAR THE CAPTAIN
4860-13185-0011 FATHER AND SON AGREED THEY SAID THE LIGHT AHEAD WAS THE ONE ON KENT'S GROUP AND THEN THE VESSEL GROUNDED AMONGST THE BREAKERS THE SEAMEN STRIPPED OFF THEIR HEAVY CLOTHING AND WENT OVERBOARD
4860-13185-0012 HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO JUMP OVERBOARD HE HEARD THE MEN IN THE WATER SHOUTING TO ONE ANOTHER MAKE FOR THE LIGHT THAT COURSE LED THEM AWAY FROM THE NEAREST LAND WHICH THEY COULD NOT SEE AT LENGTH A GREAT SEA SWEPT THE BOY AMONG THE BREAKERS
4860-13185-0013 BUT HIS GOOD ANGEL PUSHED A PIECE OF TIMBER WITHIN REACH
4860-13185-0014 HE THEN LET THE TIMBER GO AND SCRAMBLED OUT OF REACH OF THE ANGRY SURGE BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE DRY SAND HE FAINTED AND FELL DOWN WHEN HE RECOVERED HIS SENSES HE BEGAN TO LOOK FOR SHELTER THERE WAS A SIGNAL STATION NOT FAR OFF BUT HE COULD NOT SEE IT
4860-13185-0015 HE WENT AWAY FROM THE PITILESS SEA THROUGH AN OPENING BETWEEN LOW CONICAL HILLS COVERED WITH DARK SCRUB OVER A PATHWAY COMPOSED OF DRIFT SAND AND BROKEN SHELLS HE FOUND AN OLD HUT WITHOUT A DOOR THERE WAS NO ONE IN IT
4860-13185-0016 HE WENT INSIDE AND LAY DOWN SHIVERING AT DAYBREAK A BOY THE SON OF RATCLIFF THE SIGNAL MAN STARTED OUT TO LOOK FOR HIS GOATS AND AS THEY SOMETIMES PASSED THE NIGHT IN THE OLD FOWLHOUSE HE LOOKED IN FOR THEM BUT INSTEAD OF THE GOATS
4860-13185-0017 HE SAW THE NAKED CABIN BOY WHO ARE YOU HE SAID AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND WHERE DID YOU COME FROM I HAVE BEEN SHIPWRECKED REPLIED THE CABIN BOY AND THEN HE SAT UP AND BEGAN TO CRY
4860-13185-0018 AND THE BOY WAS BROUGHT TO THE COTTAGE PUT TO BED AND SUPPLIED WITH FOOD AND DRINK THE SIGNAL FOR A WRECK WAS HOISTED AT THE FLAGSTAFF BUT WHEN THE SIGNALLMAN WENT TO LOOK FOR A WRECK HE COULD NOT FIND ONE HE SEARCHED ALONG THE SHORE AND FOUND THE DEAD BODY OF THE CAPTAIN
4860-13185-0019 AND A PIECE OF SPLINTERED SPAR SEVEN OR EIGHT FEET LONG ON WHICH THE CABIN BOY HAD COME ASHORE THE ECLIPTIC WITH HER CARGO AND CREW HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED WHILE THE SIGNALMAN NEAR AT HAND SLEPT PEACEFULLY UNDISTURBED BY HER CRASHING TIMBERS
4860-13185-0020 OR THE SHOUTS OF THE DROWNING SEAMEN RATCLIFF WAS NOT A SEER AND HAD NO MYSTICAL LORE HE WAS A RUNAWAY SAILOR WHO HAD IN THE FORTIES TRAVELLED DAILY OVER THE EGERTON RUN UNCONSCIOUS OF THE TONS OF GOLD BENEATH HIS FEET
4860-13185-0021 THERE WAS A FAIR WIND AND A SMOOTH SEA WHEN THE CLONMEL WENT ASHORE AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND DAY OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE EIGHTEEN HOURS BEFORE SHE HAD TAKEN A FRESH DEPARTURE FROM RAM'S HEAD TO WILSON'S PROMONTORY
4860-13185-0022 THE ANCHORS WERE LET GO SHE SWUNG TO WIND AND AT THE FALL OF THE TIDE SHE BEDDED HERSELF SECURELY IN THE SAND HER HULL MACHINERY AND CARGO UNINJURED THE SEVENTY FIVE PASSENGERS AND CREW WERE SAFELY LANDED
4860-13185-0023 SAILS LUMBER AND PROVISIONS WERE TAKEN ASHORE IN THE WHALEBOATS AND QUARTER BOATS TENTS WERE ERECTED THE FOOD SUPPLIES WERE STOWED AWAY UNDER A CAPSIZED BOAT AND A GUARD SET OVER THEM BY CAPTAIN TOLLERVEY
4860-13185-0024 NEXT MORNING SEVEN VOLUNTEERS LAUNCHED ONE OF THE WHALEBOATS BOARDED THE STEAMER TOOK IN PROVISIONS MADE A LUG OUT OF A PIECE OF CANVAS HOISTED THE UNION JACK TO THE MAINMAST UPSIDE DOWN AND PULLED SAFELY AWAY FROM THE CLONMEL AGAINST A HEAD WIND
4860-13185-0025 THEY HOISTED THE LUG AND RAN FOR ONE OF THE SEAL ISLANDS WHERE THEY FOUND A SNUG LITTLE COVE ATE A HEARTY MEAL AND RESTED FOR THREE HOURS THEY THEN PULLED FOR THE MAINLAND AND REACHED SEALER'S COVE ABOUT MIDNIGHT WHERE THEY LANDED COOKED SUPPER
4860-13185-0026 AND PASSED THE REST OF THE NIGHT IN THE BOAT FOR FEAR OF THE BLACKS NEXT MORNING THREE MEN WENT ASHORE FOR WATER AND FILLED THE BREAKER WHEN THEY SAW THREE BLACKS COMING DOWN TOWARDS THEM SO THEY HURRIED ON BOARD AND THE ANCHOR WAS HAULED UP
4860-13185-0027 AS THE WIND WAS COMING FROM THE EAST THEY HAD TO PULL FOR FOUR HOURS BEFORE THEY WEATHERED THE SOUTHERN POINT OF THE COVE THEY THEN HOISTED SAIL AND RAN FOR WILSON'S PROMENTORY WHICH THEY ROUNDED AT TEN O'CLOCK A M
4860-13185-0028 AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THEY BROUGHT UP IN A SMALL BAY AT THE EASTERN EXTREMITY OF WESTERN PORT GLAD TO GET ASHORE AND STRETCH THEIR WEARY LIMBS AFTER A NIGHT'S REFRESHING REPOSE ON THE SANDY BEACH THEY STARTED AT BREAK OF DAY
4860-13185-0029 SAILING ALONG VERY FAST WITH A STRONG AND STEADY BREEZE FROM THE EAST ALTHOUGH THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING SWAMPED AS THE SEA BROKE OVER THE BOAT REPEATEDLY AT TWO O'CLOCK P M THEY WERE ABREAST OF PORT PHILIP HEADS
4860-13185-0030 BUT THEY FOUND A STRONG EBB TIDE WITH SUCH A RIPPLE AND BROKEN WATER THAT THEY DID NOT CONSIDER IT PRUDENT TO RUN OVER IT THEY THEREFORE PUT THE BOAT'S HEAD TO WINDWARD AND WAITED FOR FOUR HOURS WHEN THEY SAW A CUTTER BEARING DOWN ON THEM WHICH PROVED TO BE THE SISTERS
4860-13185-0031 CAPTAIN MULHOLLAND WHO TOOK THE BOAT IN TOW AND LANDED THEM AT WILLIAMSTOWN AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK P M SIXTY THREE HOURS FROM THE TIME THEY LEFT THE CLONMEL CAPTAIN LEWIS THE HARBOUR MASTER WENT TO RESCUE THE CREW AND PASSENGERS AND BROUGHT THEM ALL TO MELBOURNE
4860-13185-0032 TOGETHER WITH THE MAILS WHICH HAD BEEN LANDED ON THE ISLAND SINCE KNOWN BY THE NAME OF THE CLONMEL FOR FIFTY TWO YEARS THE BLACK BOILERS OF THE CLONMEL HAVE LAIN HALF BURIED IN THE SANDSPIT AND THEY MAY STILL BE SEEN AMONG THE BREAKERS FROM THE DECK OF EVERY VESSEL SAILING UP THE CHANNEL TO PORT ALBERT THE CLONMEL WITH HER VALUABLE CARGO WAS SOLD IN SYDNEY AND THE PURCHASER MISTER GROSE
4860-13185-0033 SET ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF MAKING HIS FORTUNE OUT OF HER HE SENT A PARTY OF WRECKERS WHO PITCHED THEIR CAMPS ON SNAKE ISLAND WHERE THEY HAD PLENTY OF GRASS SCRUB AND TIMBER
4860-13185-0034 THE WORK OF TAKING OUT THE CARGO WAS CONTINUED UNDER VARIOUS CAPTAINS FOR SIX YEARS AND THEN MISTER GROSE LOST A SCHOONER AND WAS HIMSELF LANDED IN THE COURT OF INSOLVENCY WHILE THE PIONEERS AT THE OLD PORT WERE ON THE VERGE OF STARVATION
4860-13185-0035 THE CLONMEL MEN WERE LIVING IN LUXURY THEY HAD ALL THE BLESSINGS BOTH OF LAND AND SEA CORNED BEEF SALT PORK POTATOES PLUM DUFF TEA SUGAR COFFEE WINE BEER SPIRITS AND TOBACCO FROM THE CARGO OF THE CLONMEL
4860-13185-0036 AND OYSTERS WITHOUT END FROM A NEIGHBOURING LAGOON THEY CONSTRUCTED A LARGE SQUARE PUNT WHICH THEY FILLED WITH CARGO DAILY WIND AND WEATHER PERMITTING AT OTHER TIMES THEY RESTED FROM THEIR LABOURS OR ROAMED ABOUT THE ISLAND SHOOTING BIRDS OR HUNTING KANGAROO
4860-13185-0037 BUT THOUGH UNSEEN HE WAS WATCHING THEM AND ALL THEIR WORKS ONE MORNING THE WRECKERS HAD GONE TO THE WRECK A MAN NAMED KENNEDY WAS LEFT IN CHARGE OF THE CAMP SAMBO THE BLACK COOK WAS ATTENDING TO HIS DUTIES AT THE FIRE
4860-13185-0038 AND MISSUS KENNEDY THE ONLY LADY OF THE PARTY WAS AT THE WATER HOLE WASHING CLOTHES HER HUSBAND HAD LEFT THE CAMP WITH HIS GUN IN THE HOPE OF SHOOTING SOME WATTLE BIRDS WHICH WERE THEN FAT WITH FEEDING ON THE SWEET BLOSSOMS OF THE HONEYSUCKLE
4860-13185-0039 HE WAS SITTING ON A LOG NEAR THE WATER HOLE TALKING TO HIS WIFE
4860-13185-0040 SHE STOOD WITH HER HANDS ON HER HIPS PENSIVELY CONTEMPLATING THE GARMENTS SHE HAD HER TROUBLES AND WAS TURNING THEM OVER IN HER MIND WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE QUITE DIFFERENT IT IS I BELIEVE A THING THAT OFTEN HAPPENS
4860-13185-0041 I AM THINKING FLORA HE SAID THAT THIS WOULD BE A GRAND ISLAND TO LIVE ON FAR BETTER THAN SKYE BECAUSE IT HAS NO ROCKS ON IT
4860-13185-0042 I COULD PUT SHEEP AND CATTLE ON IT AND THEY COULD NOT GO AWAY NOR BE LIFTED BECAUSE
4860-13185-0043 AND MUTTON AND WOOL AND GAME AND FISH AND OYSTERS WE COULD MAKE A GARDEN AND HAF PLENTY OF KAIL AND POTATOES AND APPLES IT'S ALL FERRY WELL DONALD SHE REPLIED FOR YOU TO BE TALKING ABOUT SHEEP AND CATTLE
4860-13185-0044 AND APPLES BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEREFER WE WOULD BE GETTING THE MONEY TO BUY THE SHEEP AND CATTLE
4860-13185-0045 AND WHEREFER I'M TO GET ANOTHER GOON IN A COUNTRY LIKE THIS I'M
4860-13185-0046 DONALD THOUGHT HIS WIFE WAS TROUBLING HERSELF ABOUT MERE TRIFLES BUT BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO SAY SO A BLACKFELLOW SNATCHED HIS GUN FROM ACROSS HIS KNEES
4860-13185-0047 AND A THIRD DID THE SAME TO FLORA AND THE UNFORTUNATE COUPLE LAY SENSELESS ON THE GROUND
4860-13185-0048 THE TENTS OCCUPIED BY THE WRECKERS HAD BEEN ENCLOSED IN A THICK HEDGE OF SCRUB TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE DRIFTING SAND THERE WAS ONLY ONE OPENING IN THE HEDGE THROUGH WHICH THE BLACKS COULD SEE SAMBO COOKING THE WRECKERS DINNER BEFORE A FIRE HIS HEAD WAS BARE
4860-13185-0049 AND HE WAS ENJOYING THE GENIAL HEAT OF EARLY SUMMER SINGING SNATCHES OF THE MELODIES OF OLD VIRGINNY THE HEARING OF THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL IS ACUTE AND HIS TALENT FOR MIMICRY ASTONISHING
4860-13185-0050 HE CAN IMITATE THE NOTES OF EVERY BIRD AND THE CALL OF EVERY ANIMAL WITH PERFECT ACCURACY SAMBO'S SENSELESS SONG ENCHANTED THE FOUR BLACKS IT WAS FIRST HEARD WITH TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE IN NEW ORLEANS
4860-13185-0051 IT WAS RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM BY EVERY AUDIENCE IN THE GREAT REPUBLIC AND IT HAD BEEN THE DELIGHT OF EVERY THEATRE IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE IT MAY BE SAID THAT JIM CROW BURIED THE LEGITIMATE DRAMA AND DANCED ON ITS GRAVE
4860-13185-0052 IT REALLY SEEMED TO JUSTIFY THE SEVERE JUDGMENT PASSED ON US BY THE SAGE OF CHELSEA THAT WE WERE SIXTEEN MILLIONS MOSTLY FOOLS NO AIR WAS EVER AT THE SAME TIME SO SILLY AND SO SUCCESSFUL AS JIM CROW
4860-13185-0053 AND DO JUST SO AND EBERY TIME I TURN ABOUT I JUMP JIM CROW THEY FORGOT THEIR MURDEROUS ERRAND
4860-13185-0054 AT LAST THERE WAS AN ECHO OF THE CLOSING WORDS WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM A LARGE GUM TREE BEYOND THE TENTS AGAINST WHICH A LADDER HAD BEEN REARED TO THE FORKS USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF A LOOK OUT BY CAPTAIN LEEBRACE SAMBO PAUSED
4860-13185-0055 LOOKED UP TO THE GUM TREE AND SAID
4860-13185-0056 THE ECHO WAS REPEATED AND THEN HE WHEELED ABOUT IN REAL EARNEST TRANSFIXED WITH HORROR UNABLE TO MOVE A LIMB THE BLACKS WERE CLOSE TO HIM NOW
4860-13185-0057 BUT FIRST THEY EXAMINED THEIR GAME CRITICALLY POKING THEIR FINGERS ABOUT HIM PINCHING HIM IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY STROKING HIS BROAD NOSE AND AMPLE LIPS WITH EVIDENT ADMIRATION AND TRYING TO PULL OUT THE CURLS ON HIS WOOLLY HEAD
4860-13185-0058 SAMBO WAS USUALLY PROUD OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE BUT JUST NOW FEAR PREVENTED HIM FROM ENJOYING THE APPLAUSE OF THE STRANGERS AT LENGTH HE RECOVERED HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO AVERT HIS IMPENDING DOOM
4860-13185-0059 IF THE BLACKS COULD BE INDUCED TO EAT THE DINNER HE WAS COOKING THEIR ATTENTION TO HIMSELF MIGHT BE DIVERTED AND THEIR APPETITES APPEASED SO HE POINTED TOWARDS THE POTS SAYING PLENTY BEEF PORK PLUM DUFF
4860-13185-0060 SO INSTEAD OF TAKING THE FOOD LIKE SENSIBLE MEN THEY UPSET ALL THE POTS WITH THEIR WADDIES AND SCATTERED THE BEEF PORK PLUM DUFF AND POTATOES SO THAT THEY WERE COVERED WITH SAND AND COMPLETELY SPOILED
4860-13185-0061 BUT THERE WAS A SOUND OF VOICES FROM THE WATERHOLE AND THEY QUICKLY GATHERED TOGETHER THEIR STOLEN GOODS AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES CAPTAIN LEEBRACE AND THE WRECKERS ARRIVED AT THE CAMP BRINGING WITH THEM KENNEDY AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD RECOVERED THEIR SENSES AND WERE ABLE TO TELL WHAT HAD HAPPENED
4860-13185-0062 DONE SPOIL ALL DE DINNER AND RUN AWAY WID DE KNIVES AND FORKS SAMBO SAID CAPTAIN LEEBRACE SOON RESOLVED ON A COURSE OF REPRISALS
4860-13185-0063 HE WENT UP THE LADDER TO THE FORKS OF THE GUM TREE WITH HIS TELESCOPE AND SOON OBTAINED A VIEW OF THE RETREATING THIEVES APPEARING OCCASIONALLY AND DISAPPEARING AMONG THE LONG GRASS AND TIMBER AND AFTER OBSERVING THE COURSE THEY WERE TAKING HE CAME DOWN THE LADDER
4860-13185-0064 WEAPONS SUITABLE FOR GAME BOTH LARGE AND SMALL DURING THE PURSUIT THE CAPTAIN EVERY NOW AND THEN FROM BEHIND A TREE SEARCHED FOR THE ENEMY WITH HIS TELESCOPE UNTIL AT LAST HE COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD HALTED AND HAD JOINED A NUMBER OF THEIR TRIBE
4860-13185-0065 THEN HE AND HIS MEN CREPT SLOWLY ALONG THE GROUND UNTIL THEY ARRIVED WITHIN SHORT RANGE OF THE NATIVES THREE OF THE BLACKS WERE WEARING THE STOLEN SHIRTS A FOURTH HAD PUT ON THE LILAC DRESS
4860-13185-0066 AND THEY WERE STRUTTING AROUND TO DISPLAY THEIR BRAVE APPAREL JUST LIKE WHITE FOLKS
4860-13185-0067 AND NEVER WASTES ANY OF IT ON HIS DESPICABLE WIFE BUT STILL CAPTAIN LEEBRACE HAD SOME DOUBT IN THE MATTER HE WHISPERED TO HIS MEN I DON'T LIKE TO SHOOT AT A GOWN
4860-13185-0068 AND YOU TAKE THE OTHER TWO ONE TO THE RIGHT THE OTHER TO THE LEFT WHEN I SAY ONE TWO THREE FIRE THE ORDER WAS OBEYED AND WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED AWAY THE PRINT DRESS WAS GONE
4860-13185-0069 BUT ALL THE REST OF THE PLUNDER WAS RECOVERED ON THE SPOT
4860-13185-0070 AND WAS FOUND IN THE CANOE AT THE OLD PORT THE BLACKFELLOW WHO WORE IT HAD TAKEN IT OFF AND PUT IT UNDER HIS KNEES IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS CANOE AND WHEN THE WHITE MEN'S BOAT CAME AFTER HIM HE WAS IN SO GREAT A HURRY TO HIDE HIMSELF IN THE SCRUB THAT HE LEFT THE DRESS BEHIND
4860-13185-0071 NEXT DAY THERE WAS A SUDDEN ALARM IN THE CAMP AT THE OLD PORT CLANCY AND DICK THE DEVIL CAME RUNNING TOWARD THE BEACH FULL OF FEAR AND EXCITEMENT SCREAMING THE BLACKS THE BLACKS THEY ARE COMING HUNDREDS OF THEM
4860-13185-0072 AND THEY ARE ALL NAKED AND DAUBED OVER WHITE AND THEY HAVE LONG SPEARS THE MEN WHO HAD GUNS CAMPBELL SHAY AND DAVY FETCHED THEM OUT OF THEIR HUTS AND STOOD READY TO RECEIVE THE ENEMY EVEN MC CLURE ALTHOUGH VERY WEAK LEFT HIS BED AND CAME OUTSIDE TO ASSIST IN THE FIGHT
4860-13185-0073 THE FRINGE OF THE SCRUB WAS DOTTED WITH THE PIEBALD BODIES OF THE BLACKS DANCING ABOUT BRANDISHING THEIR SPEARS AND SHOUTING DEFIANCE AT THE WHITE MEN
4860-13185-0074 AND THEY SHOWED NO DISPOSITION TO MAKE A RUSH OR ANYTHING LIKE A CONCERTED ATTACK CAMPBELL AFTER WATCHING THE ENEMY'S MOVEMENTS FOR SOME TIME SAID I THINK IT WILL BE BETTER TO GIVE THEM A TASTE OF THE NINE POUNDER KEEP A LOOK OUT WHILE I LOAD HER
4860-13185-0075 HE WENT INTO HIS STORE TO GET THE CHARGE READY HE TIED SOME POWDER TIGHTLY IN A PIECE OF CALICO AND RAMMED IT HOME
4860-13185-0076 ON THIS HE PUT A NINE POUND SHOT BUT REFLECTING THAT THE AIM AT THE DANCING SAVAGES WOULD BE UNCERTAIN HE PUT IN A DOUBLE CHARGE CONSISTING OF SOME BROKEN GLASS AND A HANDFUL OF NAILS
4860-13185-0077 HE THEN THRUST A WOODEN SKEWER DOWN THE TOUCH HOLE INTO THE POWDER BAG BELOW PRIMED AND DIRECTED THE PIECE TOWARDS THE SCRUB GIVING IT AS HE JUDGED SUFFICIENT ELEVATION TO SEND THE CHARGE AMONG THE THICKEST OF THE FOE AS THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THE GUN HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO ACTION
4860-13185-0078 CAMPBELL THOUGHT IT BEST TO BE CAUTIOUS SO HE ORDERED ALL HIS MEN TO TAKE SHELTER BEHIND THE STORE HE THEN SELECTED A LONG PIECE OF BARK WHICH HE LIGHTED AT THE FIRE AND STANDING BEHIND AN ANGLE OF THE BUILDING HE APPLIED THE LIGHT TO THE TOUCH HOLE
4860-13185-0079 EVERY MAN WAS WATCHING THE SCRUB TO SEE THE EFFECT OF THE DISCHARGE THERE WAS A FEARFUL EXPLOSION SUCCEEDED BY SHRIEKS OF HORROR AND FEAR FROM THE BLACKS AS THE BALL AND NAILS AND BROKEN GLASS WENT WHISTLING OVER THEIR HEADS THROUGH THE TREES
4860-13185-0080 THEN THERE WAS A MOMENT OF COMPLETE SILENCE
4860-13185-0081 BUT ON ARRIVING AT THE SCRUB NO FOE WAS TO BE SEEN EITHER DEAD OR ALIVE THE ELEVATION OF THE ARTILLERY HAD BEEN TOO GREAT AND THE MISSILES HAD PASSED OVERHEAD BUT THE RESULT WAS ALL THAT COULD BE HOPED FOR
4860-13185-0082 FOR TWO MONTHS AFTERWARDS NOT A SINGLE NATIVE WAS VISIBLE TWO VICTORIES HAD BEEN GAINED BY THE PIONEERS AND IT WAS FELT THAT THEY DESERVED SOME COMMEMORATION AT NIGHT THERE WAS A FEAST AROUND THE CAMP FIRE IT WAS OF NECESSITY A FRUGAL ONE
4860-13185-0083 CAMPBELL PRODUCED FLOUR ENOUGH FOR A LARGE DAMPER A LUXURY UNSEEN FOR THE LAST EIGHT WEEKS
4860-13185-0084 DAVY BROUGHT OUT A BOX FULL OF EGGS AND A DOZEN MUTTON BIRDS
4860-13185-0085 CLANCY AND DICK THE DEVIL THE POOR PIRATES GAVE ALL THE GAME THEY HAD THAT DAY KILLED
4860-13185-0086 THE TWELVE CANOES THE SPOILS OF VICTORY WERE OF LITTLE VALUE THEY WERE PLACED ON THE CAMP FIRE ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND REDUCED TO ASHES THE WARRIORS SAT AROUND ON LOGS AND BOXES ENJOYING THE GOOD THINGS PROVIDED AND TALKING CHEERFULLY
4860-13185-0087 BUT THEY MADE NO SET SPEECHES DINNER ORATORY IS FULL OF EMPTINESS AND THEY HAD PLENTY OF THAT EVERY DAY THEY DIPPED PANNIKINS OF TEA OUT OF THE IRON POT WHEN BURKE AND WILLS WERE STARVING AT COOPER'S CREEK ON A DIET OF NARDOO
4860-13185-0088 THE LATTER RECORDED IN HIS DIARY THAT WHAT THE FOOD WANTED WAS SUGAR HE BELIEVED THAT NARDOO AND SUGAR WOULD KEEP HIM ALIVE THE PIONEERS AT THE OLD PORT WERE CONVINCED THAT THEIR GREAT WANT WAS FAT WITH THAT THEIR SUPPER WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT
4860-13185-0089 MC CLURE WAS DYING OF CONSUMPTION AS EVERYBODY KNEW BUT HIMSELF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD COME SO FAR FROM HOME ONLY TO DIE AND HE JOINED THE REVELLERS AT THE CAMP FIRE HE SAID TO KINDLY ENQUIRERS THAT HE FELT QUITE WELL
4860-13185-0090 AND WOULD SOON REGAIN HIS STRENGTH BEFORE THAT TERRIBLE JOURNEY OVER THE MOUNTAINS HE HAD BEEN THE LIFE AND SOUL OF THE PORT
4860-13185-0091 LOOKING AS INNOCENT AS A CHILD THAT NO ONE COULD BE LONG DISPIRITED IN HIS COMPANY
4860-13185-0092 AND HE BEGAN PLAYING THE LIVELIEST OF TUNES STRATHSPEYS JIGS AND REELS UNTIL SOME OF THE MEN COULD HARDLY KEEP THEIR HEELS STILL BUT IT IS HARD TO DANCE ON LOOSE SAND AND THEY HAD TO BE CONTENTED WITH EXPRESSING THEIR FEELINGS IN SONG
4860-13185-0093 DAVY SANG YE MARINERS OF ENGLAND AND OTHER SONGS OF THE SEA AND PATELEY JIM GAVE THE ANGEL'S WHISPER FOLLOWED BY AN OLD BALLAD OF THE DAYS OF ROBIN HOOD CALLED THE WEDDING OF AYTHUR O'BRAIDLEY
4860-13185-0094 THE VIOLIN ACCOMPANYING THE AIRS AND PUTTING THE VERY SOUL OF MUSIC INTO EVERY SONG BUT BY DEGREES THE MUSICIAN GREW WEARY AND BEGAN TO PLAY ODDS AND ENDS OF OLD TUNES SACRED AND PROFANE
4860-13185-0095 AND AT LAST GLIDED UNCONSCIOUSLY AS IT WERE INTO THE LAND O THE LEAL I'M WEARIN AWAY JEAN
4860-13185-0096 TO THE LAND O THE LEAL THERE'S NAE SORROW THERE JEAN THERE'S NAE CAUL OR CARE JEAN THE DAYS AYE FAIR JEAN I THE LAND OF THE LEAL AT LAST MC CLURE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND SAID
4860-13185-0097 AND BID YE A GOOD NICHT I THINK I'LL BE GOING HAME TO MY MITHER THE MORN HE WENT INTO HIS TENT IT WAS HIGH TIDE AND THERE WAS A GENTLE SWISH OF LONG LOW WAVES LAPPING THE SANDY BEACH
4860-13185-0098 WITH THE EBB HE WAS THE FIRST MAN WHO DIED AT THE OLD PORT AND HE WAS BURIED ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER WHERE FRIDAY FIRST SAW ITS WATERS FLOWING TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN
