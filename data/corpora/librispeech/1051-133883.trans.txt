1051-133883-0000 CHAPTER FOUR STEPPING STONES WHEN NAT WENT INTO SCHOOL ON MONDAY MORNING HE QUAKED INWARDLY FOR NOW HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE TO DISPLAY HIS IGNORANCE BEFORE THEM ALL
1051-133883-0001 BUT MISTER BHAER GAVE HIM A SEAT IN THE DEEP WINDOW WHERE HE COULD TURN HIS BACK ON THE OTHERS AND FRANZ HEARD HIM SAY HIS LESSONS THERE SO NO ONE COULD HEAR HIS BLUNDERS OR SEE HOW HE BLOTTED HIS COPYBOOK HE WAS TRULY GRATEFUL FOR THIS AND TOILED AWAY SO DILIGENTLY THAT MISTER BHAER SAID SMILING
1051-133883-0002 WHEN HE SAW HIS HOT FACE AND INKY FINGERS DON'T WORK SO HARD MY BOY YOU WILL TIRE YOURSELF OUT AND THERE IS TIME ENOUGH
1051-133883-0003 THEY KNOW HEAPS AND I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING SAID NAT
1051-133883-0004 SITTING DOWN BESIDE HIM WHILE FRANZ LED A CLASS OF SMALL STUDENTS THROUGH THE INTRICACIES OF THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE DO I AND NAT LOOKED UTTERLY INCREDULOUS YES FOR ONE THING YOU CAN KEEP YOUR TEMPER AND JACK WHO IS QUICK AT NUMBERS CANNOT THAT IS AN EXCELLENT LESSON
1051-133883-0005 THEN YOU CAN PLAY THE VIOLIN AND NOT ONE OF THE LADS CAN THOUGH THEY WANT TO DO IT VERY MUCH BUT BEST OF ALL NAT YOU REALLY CARE TO LEARN SOMETHING AND THAT IS HALF THE BATTLE
1051-133883-0006 THEN HE SAID ALOUD AND SO EARNESTLY THAT DEMI HEARD HIM I DO WANT TO LEARN AND I WILL TRY
1051-133883-0007 THEY SHAN'T LAUGH AT YOU IF THEY DO I'LL I'LL TELL THEM NOT TO CRIED DEMI QUITE FORGETTING WHERE HE WAS THE CLASS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF SEVEN TIMES NINE AND EVERYONE LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
1051-133883-0008 THINKING THAT A LESSON IN LEARNING TO HELP ONE ANOTHER WAS BETTER THAN ARITHMETIC JUST THEN MISTER BHAER TOLD THEM ABOUT NAT MAKING SUCH AN INTERESTING AND TOUCHING LITTLE STORY OUT OF IT THAT THE GOOD HEARTED LADS ALL PROMISED TO LEND HIM A HAND
1051-133883-0009 THIS APPEAL ESTABLISHED THE RIGHT FEELING AMONG THEM AND NAT HAD FEW HINDRANCES TO STRUGGLE AGAINST FOR EVERY ONE WAS GLAD TO GIVE HIM A BOOST UP THE LADDER OF LEARNING TILL HE WAS STRONGER MUCH STUDY WAS NOT GOOD FOR HIM HOWEVER
1051-133883-0010 NEVER WAS A GARDEN MORE FAITHFULLY HOED MISTER BHAER REALLY FEARED THAT NOTHING WOULD FIND TIME TO GROW NAT KEPT UP SUCH A STIRRING OF THE SOIL
1051-133883-0011 WHERE HE WORKED AND HUMMED AS BUSILY AS THE BEES BOOMING ALL ABOUT HIM THIS IS THE CROP I LIKE BEST MISSUS BHAER USED TO SAY AS SHE PINCHED THE ONCE THIN CHEEKS NOW GETTING PLUMP AND RUDDY
1051-133883-0012 POVERTY DEMI WAS HIS LITTLE FRIEND TOMMY HIS PATRON AND DAISY THE COMFORTER OF ALL HIS WOES FOR THOUGH THE CHILDREN WERE YOUNGER THAN HE HIS TIMID SPIRIT FOUND A PLEASURE IN THEIR INNOCENT SOCIETY AND RATHER SHRUNK FROM THE ROUGH SPORTS OF THE ELDER LADS
1051-133883-0013 MISTER LAURENCE DID NOT FORGET HIM BUT SENT CLOTHES AND BOOKS MUSIC AND KIND MESSAGES AND NOW AND THEN CAME OUT TO SEE HOW HIS BOY WAS GETTING ON OR TOOK HIM INTO TOWN TO A CONCERT ON WHICH OCCASIONS NAT FELT HIMSELF TRANSLATED INTO THE SEVENTH HEAVEN OF BLISS
1051-133883-0014 FOR HE WENT TO MISTER LAURENCE'S GREAT HOUSE SAW HIS PRETTY WIFE AND LITTLE FAIRY OF A DAUGHTER HAD A GOOD DINNER AND WAS MADE SO COMFORTABLE THAT HE TALKED AND DREAMED OF IT FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS AFTERWARD IT TAKES SO LITTLE TO MAKE A CHILD HAPPY THAT IT IS A PITY
1051-133883-0015 IN A WORLD SO FULL OF SUNSHINE AND PLEASANT THINGS THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANY WISTFUL FACES EMPTY HANDS OR LONELY LITTLE HEARTS FEELING THIS THE BHAERS GATHERED UP ALL THE CRUMBS THEY COULD FIND TO FEED THEIR FLOCK OF HUNGRY SPARROWS FOR THEY WERE NOT RICH EXCEPT IN CHARITY
1051-133883-0016 AND IN MENDING THESE NAT FOUND AN EMPLOYMENT THAT JUST SUITED HIM HE WAS VERY NEAT AND SKILLFUL WITH THOSE SLENDER FINGERS OF HIS AND PASSED MANY A RAINY AFTERNOON WITH HIS GUM BOTTLE PAINT BOX AND KNIFE
1051-133883-0017 REPAIRING FURNITURE ANIMALS AND GAMES WHILE DAISY WAS DRESSMAKER TO THE DILAPIDATED DOLLS AS FAST AS THE TOYS WERE MENDED
1051-133883-0018 REVELLING OVER ROBINSON CRUSOE ARABIAN NIGHTS EDGEWORTH'S TALES
1051-133883-0019 AND HIS EAGERNESS TO SEE WHAT CAME NEXT IN THE STORY HELPED HIM ON TILL HE COULD READ AS WELL AS ANYBODY
1051-133883-0020 ANOTHER HELPFUL THING HAPPENED IN A MOST UNEXPECTED AND AGREEABLE MANNER SEVERAL OF THE BOYS WERE IN BUSINESS AS THEY CALLED IT FOR MOST OF THEM WERE POOR AND KNOWING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN WAY TO MAKE BY AND BY THE BHAERS ENCOURAGED ANY EFFORTS AT INDEPENDENCE TOMMY SOLD HIS EGGS
1051-133883-0021 JACK SPECULATED IN LIVE STOCK FRANZ HELPED IN THE TEACHING AND WAS PAID FOR IT NED HAD A TASTE FOR CARPENTRY
1051-133883-0022 WHILE DEMI CONSTRUCTED WATER MILLS WHIRLIGIGS AND UNKNOWN MACHINES OF AN INTRICATE AND USELESS NATURE AND DISPOSED OF THEM TO THE BOYS LET HIM BE A MECHANIC IF HE LIKES SAID MISTER BHAER GIVE A BOY A TRADE AND HE IS INDEPENDENT WORK IS WHOLESOME AND WHATEVER TALENT THESE LADS POSSESS
1051-133883-0023 BE IT FOR POETRY OR PLOUGHING IT SHALL BE CULTIVATED AND MADE USEFUL TO THEM IF POSSIBLE SO WHEN NAT CAME RUNNING TO HIM ONE DAY TO ASK WITH AN EXCITED FACE
1051-133883-0024 CAN I GO AND FIDDLE FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE TO HAVE A PICNIC IN OUR WOODS THEY WILL PAY ME AND I'D LIKE TO EARN SOME MONEY AS THE OTHER BOYS DO AND FIDDLING IS THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO DO IT MISTER BHAER ANSWERED READILY GO AND WELCOME
1051-133883-0025 WHICH HE DISPLAYED WITH INTENSE SATISFACTION
1051-133883-0026 IT IS SO MUCH NICER THAN FIDDLING IN THE STREET FOR THEN I GOT NONE OF THE MONEY AND NOW I HAVE IT ALL AND A GOOD TIME BESIDES
1051-133883-0027 PROUDLY PATTING THE OLD POCKETBOOK AND FEELING LIKE A MILLIONAIRE ALREADY HE WAS IN BUSINESS TRULY FOR PICNICS WERE PLENTY AS SUMMER OPENED AND NAT'S SKILL WAS IN GREAT DEMAND HE WAS ALWAYS AT LIBERTY TO GO IF LESSONS WERE NOT NEGLECTED AND IF THE PICNICKERS WERE RESPECTABLE YOUNG PEOPLE
1051-133883-0028 FOR MISTER BHAER EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT A GOOD PLAIN EDUCATION IS NECESSARY FOR EVERYONE AND THAT NO AMOUNT OF MONEY SHOULD HIRE HIM TO GO WHERE HE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO DO WRONG NAT QUITE AGREED TO THIS AND IT WAS A PLEASANT SIGHT TO SEE THE INNOCENT HEARTED LAD GO DRIVING AWAY IN THE GAY WAGONS THAT STOPPED AT THE GATE FOR HIM
1051-133883-0029 I'M GOING TO SAVE UP TILL I GET ENOUGH TO BUY A VIOLIN FOR MYSELF AND THEN I CAN EARN MY OWN LIVING CAN'T I HE USED TO SAY AS HE BROUGHT HIS DOLLARS TO MISTER BHAER TO KEEP I HOPE SO NAT BUT WE MUST GET YOU STRONG AND HEARTY FIRST AND PUT A LITTLE MORE KNOWLEDGE INTO THIS MUSICAL HEAD OF YOURS
1051-133883-0030 WITH MUCH CONGENIAL WORK ENCOURAGEMENT AND HOPE NAT FOUND LIFE GETTING EASIER AND HAPPIER EVERY DAY AND MADE SUCH PROGRESS IN HIS MUSIC LESSONS THAT HIS TEACHER FORGAVE HIS SLOWNESS IN SOME OTHER THINGS KNOWING VERY WELL THAT WHERE THE HEART IS THE MIND WORKS BEST
1051-133883-0031 AND SHE WAS OFTEN FOUND SITTING ON THE STAIRS OUTSIDE NAT'S DOOR WHILE HE WAS PRACTISING THIS PLEASED HIM VERY MUCH AND HE PLAYED HIS BEST FOR THAT ONE QUIET LITTLE LISTENER FOR SHE NEVER WOULD COME IN BUT PREFERRED TO SIT SEWING HER GAY PATCHWORK OR TENDING ONE OF HER MANY DOLLS WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DREAMY PLEASURE ON HER FACE THAT MADE AUNT JO SAY
1051-133883-0032 WITH TEARS IN HER EYES SO LIKE MY BETH AND GO SOFTLY BY LEST EVEN HER FAMILIAR PRESENCE MAR THE CHILD'S SWEET SATISFACTION NAT WAS VERY FOND OF MISSUS BHAER BUT FOUND SOMETHING EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE IN THE GOOD PROFESSOR WHO TOOK FATHERLY CARE OF THE SHY FEEBLE BOY
1051-133883-0033 PERHAPS HIS LOVE OF MUSIC KEPT IT SWEET IN SPITE OF THE DISCORD ALL ABOUT HIM MISTER LAURIE SAID SO AND HE OUGHT TO KNOW HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE FATHER BHAER TOOK PLEASURE IN FOSTERING POOR NAT'S VIRTUES AND IN CURING HIS FAULTS FINDING HIS NEW PUPIL AS DOCILE AND AFFECTIONATE AS A GIRL
1051-133883-0034 THOUGH YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT FOR SHE PETTED HIM AS SHE DID DAISY AND HE THOUGHT HER A VERY DELIGHTFUL WOMAN ONE FAULT OF NAT'S GAVE THE BHAERS MUCH ANXIETY ALTHOUGH THEY SAW HOW IT HAD BEEN STRENGTHENED BY FEAR AND IGNORANCE I REGRET TO SAY THAT NAT SOMETIMES TOLD LIES
1051-133883-0035 NOT VERY BLACK ONES SELDOM GETTING DEEPER THAN GRAY AND OFTEN THE MILDEST OF WHITE FIBS BUT THAT DID NOT MATTER A LIE IS A LIE AND THOUGH WE ALL TELL MANY POLITE UNTRUTHS IN THIS QUEER WORLD OF OURS IT IS NOT RIGHT AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT
1051-133883-0036 YOU CANNOT BE TOO CAREFUL WATCH YOUR TONGUE AND EYES AND HANDS FOR IT IS EASY TO TELL AND LOOK AND ACT UNTRUTH
1051-133883-0037 IN ONE OF THE TALKS HE HAD WITH NAT ABOUT HIS CHIEF TEMPTATION I KNOW IT AND I DON'T MEAN TO BUT IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO GET ALONG IF YOU AIN'T VERY FUSSY ABOUT BEING EXACTLY TRUE
1051-133883-0038 AND NOW I DO SOMETIMES BECAUSE THE BOYS LAUGH AT ME I KNOW IT'S BAD BUT I FORGET AND NAT LOOKED MUCH DEPRESSED BY HIS SINS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE LAD I USED TO TELL LIES ACH WHAT FIBS THEY WERE
1051-133883-0039 MY PARENTS HAD TALKED AND CRIED AND PUNISHED BUT STILL DID I FORGET AS YOU THEN SAID THE DEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER I SHALL HELP YOU TO REMEMBER AND PUT A CHECK ON THIS UNRULY PART WITH THAT SHE DREW OUT MY TONGUE AND SNIPPED THE END WITH HER SCISSORS TILL THE BLOOD RAN THAT WAS TERRIBLE YOU MAY BELIEVE
1051-133883-0040 THAT I HAD TIME TO THINK AFTER THAT I WAS MORE CAREFUL AND GOT ON BETTER FOR I FEARED THE BIG SCISSORS
1051-133883-0041 BUT IF YOU THINK IT WILL CURE ME I'LL LET YOU SNIP MY TONGUE SAID NAT HEROICALLY FOR HE DREADED PAIN YET DID WISH TO STOP FIBBING MISTER BHAER SMILED BUT SHOOK HIS HEAD
1051-133883-0042 SEE NOW WHEN YOU TELL A LIE I WILL NOT PUNISH YOU BUT YOU SHALL PUNISH ME HOW ASKED NAT STARTLED AT THE IDEA YOU SHALL FERULE ME IN THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED WAY I SELDOM DO IT MYSELF BUT IT MAY MAKE YOU REMEMBER BETTER TO GIVE ME PAIN THAN TO FEEL IT YOURSELF
1051-133883-0043 STRIKE YOU OH I COULDN'T CRIED NAT THEN MIND THAT TRIPPING TONGUE OF THINE I HAVE NO WISH TO BE HURT BUT I WOULD GLADLY BEAR MUCH PAIN TO CURE THIS FAULT THIS SUGGESTION MADE SUCH AN IMPRESSION ON NAT THAT FOR A LONG TIME HE SET A WATCH UPON HIS LIPS
1051-133883-0044 AND WAS DESPERATELY ACCURATE FOR MISTER BHAER JUDGED RIGHTLY
1051-133883-0045 NAT DECLARED HE DIDN'T AND THEN WAS ASHAMED TO OWN UP THAT HE DID DO IT WHEN JACK WAS CHASING HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE HE THOUGHT NO ONE WOULD FIND IT OUT
1051-133883-0046 TOMMY GAVE HIS EVIDENCE AND MISTER BHAER HEARD IT
1051-133883-0047 AND LOOK AT HIM WITH A FRIGHTENED FACE HE PUT THE LITTLE BOY DOWN SAYING GO TO THY MOTHER BUBCHEN I WILL COME SOON
1051-133883-0048 THE BOYS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE
1051-133883-0049 MISTER BHAER HAD JUST TAKEN DOWN THE LONG RULE THAT HUNG OVER HIS DESK
1051-133883-0050 WISH I HADN'T TOLD THOUGHT GOOD NATURED TOMMY FOR TO BE FERULED WAS THE DEEPEST DISGRACE AT THIS SCHOOL
1051-133883-0051 YES BUT PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME I CAN'T BEAR IT CRIED NAT
1051-133883-0052 WHY DON'T HE UP AND TAKE IT LIKE A MAN I WOULD THOUGHT TOMMY THOUGH HIS HEART BEAT FAST AT THE SIGHT I SHALL KEEP MY WORD AND YOU MUST REMEMBER TO TELL THE TRUTH OBEY ME NAT TAKE THIS AND GIVE ME SIX GOOD STROKES
1051-133883-0053 TOMMY WAS SO STAGGERED BY THIS LAST SPEECH THAT HE NEARLY TUMBLED DOWN THE BANK BUT SAVED HIMSELF
1051-133883-0054 LOOKING AS SCARED AND GUILTY AS IF ABOUT TO STAB HIS MASTER HE GAVE TWO FEEBLE BLOWS ON THE BROAD HAND HELD OUT TO HIM THEN HE STOPPED AND LOOKED UP HALF BLIND WITH TEARS BUT MISTER BHAER SAID STEADILY GO ON AND STRIKE HARDER AS IF SEEING THAT IT MUST BE DONE AND EAGER TO HAVE THE HARD TASK SOON OVER
1051-133883-0055 NAT DREW HIS SLEEVE ACROSS HIS EYES AND GAVE TWO MORE QUICK HARD STROKES THAT REDDENED THE HAND YET HURT THE GIVER MORE ISN'T THAT ENOUGH HE ASKED IN A BREATHLESS SORT OF TONE TWO MORE WAS ALL THE ANSWER AND HE GAVE THEM HARDLY SEEING WHERE THEY FELL THEN THREW THE RULE ALL ACROSS THE ROOM
1051-133883-0056 AND HUGGING THE KIND HAND IN BOTH HIS OWN LAID HIS FACE DOWN ON IT SOBBING OUT IN A PASSION OF LOVE AND SHAME AND PENITENCE I WILL REMEMBER OH I WILL THEN MISTER BHAER PUT AN ARM ABOUT HIM AND SAID IN A TONE AS COMPASSIONATE AS IT HAD JUST NOW BEEN FIRM
1051-133883-0057 I THINK YOU WILL ASK THE DEAR GOD TO HELP YOU AND TRY TO SPARE US BOTH ANOTHER SCENE LIKE THIS TOMMY SAW NO MORE FOR HE CREPT BACK TO THE HALL LOOKING SO EXCITED AND SOBER THAT THE BOYS CROWDED ROUND HIM TO ASK WHAT WAS BEING DONE TO NAT
1051-133883-0058 FOR THIS REVERSING THE ORDER OF THINGS ALMOST TOOK THEIR BREATH AWAY HE MADE ME DO THE SAME THING ONCE SAID EMIL AS IF CONFESSING A CRIME OF THE DEEPEST DYE AND YOU HIT HIM DEAR OLD FATHER BHAER BY THUNDER I'D JUST LIKE TO SEE YOU DO IT NOW SAID NED
1051-133883-0059 I'D RATHER HAVE MY HEAD CUT OFF THAN DO IT NOW
1051-133883-0060 AND I COULDN'T GO ON NO SIR
1051-133883-0061 SAID TENDER HEARTED TOMMY OF COURSE WE WON'T BUT IT'S AWFUL TO TELL LIES AND DEMI LOOKED AS IF HE FOUND THE AWFULNESS MUCH INCREASED WHEN THE PUNISHMENT FELL NOT UPON THE SINNER BUT HIS BEST UNCLE FRITZ
1051-133883-0062 NAT DID NOT COME TO DINNER BUT MISSUS JO TOOK SOME UP TO HIM AND SAID A TENDER WORD WHICH DID HIM GOOD THOUGH HE COULD NOT LOOK AT HER BY AND BY THE LADS PLAYING OUTSIDE HEARD THE VIOLIN AND SAID AMONG THEMSELVES HE'S ALL RIGHT NOW HE WAS ALL RIGHT BUT FELT SHY ABOUT GOING DOWN
1051-133883-0063 I'M GOING TO WALK WANT TO COME ASKED NAT TRYING TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING WAS THE MATTER YET FEELING VERY GRATEFUL FOR HER SILENT SYMPATHY BECAUSE HE FANCIED EVERYONE MUST LOOK UPON HIM AS A WRETCH OH YES
1051-133883-0064 FOR BOYS HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE DELICACY THAN THEY GET CREDIT FOR
1051-133883-0065 WHEN IN DISGRACE GENTLE LITTLE DAISY WAS THEIR MOST CONGENIAL FRIEND
1051-133883-0066 AND HUNG ALL OVER WITH DAISY CHAINS MADE BY HIS LITTLE PLAYMATE WHILE HE LAY ON THE GRASS AND TOLD HER STORIES NO ONE SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SCENE OF THE MORNING BUT ITS EFFECT WAS ALL THE MORE LASTING FOR THAT REASON PERHAPS
