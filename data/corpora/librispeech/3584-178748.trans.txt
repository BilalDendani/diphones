3584-178748-0001 THE SPACIOUS AND COMFORTABLE MANSION OF WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF THE LITTLE MISTRESS THE HIGH RANK OF THE VETERAN OFFICER WHO CLAIMED HER AS HIS WARD AND NIECE THE ABUNDANCE REGULARITY AND RESPECTABILITY OF HER NEW LIFE THE LEISURE THE PRIVACY THE ATTENDANCE OF SERVANTS
3584-178748-0002 WERE ALL SO DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING TO WHICH SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ACCUSTOMED THAT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE DOUBTED ITS REALITY AND DISTRUSTED HER OWN IDENTITY SOMETIMES OF A MORNING AFTER A VERY VIVID DREAM OF THE ALLEYS CELLARS AND GUTTERS RAGPICKERS NEWSBOYS AND BEGGARS OF NEW YORK
3584-178748-0003 SHE WOULD OPEN HER EYES UPON HER OWN COMFORTABLE CHAMBER WITH ITS GLOWING FIRE AND CRIMSON CURTAINS AND BRIGHT MIRROR CROWNING THE WALNUT BUREAU BETWEEN THEM SHE WOULD JUMP UP AND GAZE WILDLY AROUND NOT REMEMBERING WHERE SHE WAS OR HOW SHE CAME THITHER
3584-178748-0004 SOMETIMES SUDDENLY STARTLED BY AN INTENSE REALIZATION OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER PAST AND HER PRESENT LIFE SHE WOULD MENTALLY INQUIRE CAN THIS BE REALLY I MYSELF AND NOT ANOTHER I THE LITTLE HOUSELESS WANDERER THROUGH THE STREETS AND ALLEYS OF NEW YORK
3584-178748-0005 I THE LITTLE NEWSGIRL IN BOY'S CLOTHES I THE WRETCHED LITTLE VAGRANT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BEFORE THE RECORDER AND WAS ABOUT TO BE SENT TO THE HOUSE OF REFUGE FOR JUVENILE DELINQUENTS CAN THIS BE I CAPITOLA THE LITTLE OUTCAST OF THE CITY

3584-178748-0013 I DIDN'T GROW UP IN RAG ALLEY NEW YORK FOR NOTHING SO HALF IN JEST AND HALF IN EARNEST CAPITOLA SOLILOQUIZED UPON HER CHANGE OF FORTUNE HER EDUCATION WAS COMMENCED BUT PROGRESSED RATHER IRREGULARLY
3584-178748-0014 OLD HURRICANE BOUGHT HER BOOKS AND MAPS SLATES AND COPY BOOKS SET HER LESSONS IN GRAMMAR GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY AND MADE HER WRITE COPIES DO SUMS AND READ AND RECITE LESSONS TO HIM MISSUS CONDIMENT TAUGHT HER THE MYSTERIES OF CUTTING AND BASTING BACK STITCHING AND FELLING
3584-178748-0015 HEMMING AND SEAMING A PUPIL AS SHARP AS CAPITOLA SOON MASTERED HER TASKS AND FOUND HERSELF EACH DAY WITH MANY HOURS OF LEISURE WITH WHICH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
3584-178748-0016 WITH ALL ITS ATTICS CUDDIES COCK LOFTS AND CELLARS THEN IN WANDERING THROUGH THE OLD ORNAMENTAL GROUNDS THAT WERE EVEN IN WINTER AND IN TOTAL NEGLECT BEAUTIFUL WITH THEIR WILD GROWTH OF EVERGREENS
3584-178748-0017 THENCE SHE EXTENDED HER RESEARCHES INTO THE WILD AND PICTURESQUE COUNTRY AROUND SHE WAS NEVER WEARY OF ADMIRING THE GREAT FOREST THAT CLIMBED THE HEIGHTS OF THE MOUNTAINS BEHIND THEIR HOUSE THE GREAT BLEAK PRECIPICES OF GRAY ROCK SEEN THROUGH THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES OF THE TREES
3584-178748-0018 AND THE RIVER ITSELF WITH ITS RUSHING STREAM AND RAGING RAPIDS CAPITOLA HAD BECOME A SKILFUL AS SHE HAD FIRST BEEN A FEARLESS RIDER BUT HER RIDES WERE CONFINED TO THE DOMAIN BETWEEN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE AND THE RIVER SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO FORD THE ONE OR CLIMB THE OTHER
3584-178748-0019 PERHAPS IF SUCH A PROHIBITION HAD NEVER BEEN MADE CAPITOLA WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF DOING THE ONE OR THE OTHER BUT WE ALL KNOW THE DIABOLICAL FASCINATION THERE IS IN FORBIDDEN PLEASURES FOR YOUNG HUMAN NATURE AND NO SOONER HAD CAP BEEN COMMANDED
3584-178748-0020 IF SHE VALUED HER SAFETY NOT TO CROSS THE WATER OR CLIMB THE PRECIPICE THAN AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS IN THE VALLEY BEHIND THE MOUNTAIN AND WHAT MIGHT BE IN THE WOODS ACROSS THE RIVER AND SHE LONGED ABOVE ALL THINGS TO EXPLORE AND FIND OUT FOR HERSELF
3584-178748-0021 SHE WOULD EAGERLY HAVE DONE SO NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROHIBITION BUT WOOL WHO ALWAYS ATTENDED HER RIDES WAS SADLY IN THE WAY IF SHE COULD ONLY GET RID OF WOOL SHE RESOLVED TO GO UPON A LIMITED EXPLORING EXPEDITION ONE DAY A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED
3584-178748-0022 IT WAS A DAY OF UNUSUAL BEAUTY WHEN AUTUMN SEEMED TO BE SMILING UPON THE EARTH WITH HER BRIGHTEST SMILES BEFORE PASSING AWAY IN A WORD IT WAS INDIAN SUMMER THE BEAUTY OF THE WEATHER HAD TEMPTED OLD HURRICANE TO RIDE TO THE COUNTY SEAT ON PARTICULAR BUSINESS
3584-178748-0023 CONNECTED WITH HIS WARD HERSELF CAPITOLA LEFT ALONE AMUSED HERSELF WITH HER TASKS UNTIL THE AFTERNOON THEN CALLING A BOY SHE ORDERED HIM TO SADDLE HER HORSE AND BRING HIM AROUND
3584-178748-0024 THERE IS NO ONE TO ATTEND YOU WOOL HAS GONE WITH HIS MASTER SAID MISSUS CONDIMENT AS SHE MET CAPITOLA IN THE HALL HABITED FOR HER RIDE I KNOW THAT BUT I CANNOT BE MEWED UP HERE IN THE OLD HOUSE AND DEPRIVED OF MY AFTERNOON RIDE EXCLAIMED CAPITOLA DECIDEDLY

3584-178748-0029 ROBBING MAIL COACHES STEALING NEGROES BREAKING INTO HOUSES AND COMMITTING EVERY SORT OF DEPREDATION THEIR HANDS ARE RED WITH MURDER AND THEIR SOULS BLACK WITH DARKER CRIMES DARKER CRIMES THAN MURDER EJACULATED CAPITOLA
3584-178748-0030 YES CHILD YES THERE ARE DARKER CRIMES ONLY LAST WINTER HE AND THREE OF HIS GANG BROKE INTO A SOLITARY HOUSE WHERE THERE WAS A LONE WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER AND IT IS NOT A STORY FOR YOU TO HEAR BUT IF THE PEOPLE HAD CAUGHT BLACK DONALD THEN THEY WOULD HAVE BURNED HIM AT THE STAKE
3584-178748-0031 HIS LIFE IS FORFEIT BY A HUNDRED CRIMES HE IS AN OUTLAW AND A HEAVY PRICE IS SET UPON HIS HEAD
3584-178748-0032 NO MY DEAR AT LEAST NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO SO YET HIS VERY HAUNTS ARE UNKNOWN BUT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN CONCEALED MOUNTAIN CAVERNS HOW I WOULD LIKE THE GLORY OF CAPTURING BLACK DONALD SAID CAPITOLA YOU CHILD YOU CAPTURE BLACK DONALD
3584-178748-0033 YOU ARE CRAZY OH BY STRATAGEM I MEAN NOT BY FORCE OH HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO CAPTURE BLACK DONALD THERE'S MY HORSE GOOD BY AND BEFORE MISSUS CONDIMENT COULD RAISE ANOTHER OBJECTION CAPITOLA RAN OUT SPRANG INTO HER SADDLE
3584-178748-0034 AND WAS SEEN CAREERING DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE RIVER AS FAST AS HER HORSE COULD FLY MY LORD BUT THE MAJOR WILL BE HOPPING IF HE FINDS IT OUT WAS GOOD MISSUS CONDIMENT'S DISMAYED EXCLAMATION REJOICING IN HER FREEDOM
3584-178748-0035 AND THEN WALKED HER HORSE UP AND DOWN ALONG THE COURSE OF THE STREAM UNTIL SHE FOUND A GOOD FORDING PLACE THEN GATHERING UP HER RIDING SKIRT AND THROWING IT OVER THE NECK OF HER HORSE SHE PLUNGED BOLDLY INTO THE STREAM AND WITH THE WATER SPLASHING AND FOAMING ALL AROUND HER
3584-178748-0036 URGED HIM ONWARD TILL THEY CROSSED THE RIVER AND CLIMBED UP THE OPPOSITE BANK A BRIDLE PATH LAY BEFORE HER LEADING FROM THE FORDING PLACE THROUGH A DEEP WOOD THAT PATH ATTRACTED HER SHE FOLLOWED IT CHARMED ALIKE BY THE SOLITUDE OF THE WOOD THE NOVELTY OF THE SCENE
3584-178748-0037 AND HER OWN SENSE OF FREEDOM BUT ONE THOUGHT WAS GIVEN TO THE STORY OF BLACK DONALD AND THAT WAS A REASSURING ONE IF BLACK DONALD IS A MAIL ROBBER THEN THIS LITTLE BRIDLE PATH IS FAR ENOUGH OFF HIS BEAT AND SO SAYING SHE GAYLY GALLOPED ALONG SINGING AS SHE WENT
3584-178748-0038 FOLLOWING THE NARROW PATH UP HILL AND DOWN DALE THROUGH THE WINTRY WOODS DRAWN ON BY THE ATTRACTION OF THE UNKNOWN AND DECEIVING HERSELF BY THE CONTINUED REPETITION OF ONE RESOLVE NAMELY
3584-178748-0039 THEN I WILL TURN BACK SHE GALLOPED ON AND ON ON AND ON ON AND ON UNTIL SHE HAD PUT SEVERAL MILES BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER HOME UNTIL HER HORSE BEGAN TO EXHIBIT SIGNS OF WEARINESS AND THE LEVEL RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN
3584-178748-0040 WERE STRIKING REDLY THROUGH THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES OF THE TREES CAP DREW REIN AT THE TOP OF A HIGH WOODED HILL AND LOOKED ABOUT HER ON HER LEFT HAND THE SUN WAS SINKING LIKE A BALL OF FIRE BELOW THE HORIZON ALL AROUND HER EVERYWHERE WERE THE WINTRY WOODS
3584-178748-0041 FAR AWAY IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE SHE HAD COME SHE SAW THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS BEHIND HURRICANE HALL LOOKING LIKE BLUE CLOUDS AGAINST THE SOUTHERN HORIZON THE HALL ITSELF AND THE RIVER BELOW WERE OUT OF SIGHT I WONDER HOW FAR I AM FROM HOME
3584-178748-0042 SAID CAPITOLA UNEASILY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN MILES I RECKON DEAR ME I DIDN'T MEAN TO RIDE SO FAR I'VE GOT OVER A GREAT DEAL OF GROUND IN THESE TWO HOURS I SHALL NOT GET BACK SO SOON MY HORSE IS TIRED TO DEATH
3584-178748-0043 IT WILL TAKE ME THREE HOURS TO REACH HURRICANE HALL GOOD GRACIOUS IT WILL BE PITCH DARK BEFORE I GET THERE NO THANK HEAVEN THERE WILL BE A MOON BUT WON'T THERE BE A ROW THOUGH
3584-178748-0044 WELL I MUST TURN ABOUT AND LOSE NO TIME COME GYP GET UP GYP GOOD HORSE WE'RE GOING HOME AND SO SAYING CAPITOLA TURNED HER HORSE'S HEAD AND URGED HIM INTO A GALLOP SHE HAD GONE ON FOR ABOUT A MILE AND IT WAS GROWING DARK AND HER HORSE WAS AGAIN SLACKENING HIS PACE
3584-178748-0045 WHEN SHE THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF ANOTHER HORSE'S HOOFS BEHIND HER SHE DREW REIN AND LISTENED AND WAS SURE OF IT NOW WITHOUT BEING THE LEAST OF A COWARD CAPITOLA THOUGHT OF THE LONELINESS OF THE WOODS THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR HER OWN HELPLESSNESS AND BLACK DONALD
3584-178748-0046 AND THINKING DISCRETION THE BETTER PART OF VALOR SHE URGED HER HORSE ONCE MORE INTO A GALLOP FOR A FEW HUNDRED YARDS BUT THE JADED BEAST SOON BROKE INTO A TROT AND SUBSIDED INTO A WALK THAT THREATENED SOON TO COME TO A STANDSTILL THE INVISIBLE PURSUER GAINED ON HER
3584-178748-0047 IN VAIN SHE URGED HER STEED WITH WHIP AND VOICE THE POOR BEAST WOULD OBEY AND TROT FOR A FEW YARDS AND THEN FALL INTO A WALK THE THUNDERING FOOTFALLS OF THE PURSUING HORSE WERE CLOSE IN THE REAR
