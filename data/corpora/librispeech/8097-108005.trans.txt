8097-108005-0000 OF THE INCONVENIENCE OF GREATNESS SINCE WE CANNOT ATTAIN UNTO IT LET US REVENGE OUR SELVES BY RAILING AT IT AND YET
8097-108005-0001 IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY RAILING AGAINST ANYTHING TO PROCLAIM ITS DEFECTS BECAUSE THEY ARE IN ALL THINGS TO BE FOUND HOW BEAUTIFUL OR HOW MUCH TO BE COVETED SOEVER
8097-108005-0002 GREATNESS HAS IN GENERAL THIS MANIFEST ADVANTAGE THAT IT CAN LOWER ITSELF WHEN IT PLEASES AND HAS VERY NEAR THE CHOICE OF BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER CONDITION FOR A MAN DOES NOT FALL FROM ALL HEIGHTS
8097-108005-0003 THERE ARE SEVERAL FROM WHICH ONE MAY DESCEND WITHOUT FALLING DOWN IT DOES INDEED APPEAR TO ME THAT WE VALUE IT AT TOO HIGH A RATE
8097-108005-0004 AND ALSO OVERVALUE THE RESOLUTION OF THOSE WHOM WE HAVE EITHER SEEN OR HEARD HAVE CONTEMNED IT OR DISPLACED THEMSELVES OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
8097-108005-0005 ITS ESSENCE IS NOT SO EVIDENTLY COMMODIOUS THAT A MAN MAY NOT WITH OUT A MIRACLE REFUSE IT I FIND IT A VERY HARD THING TO UNDERGO MISFORTUNES
8097-108005-0006 AND TO AVOID GREATNESS I THINK A VERY EASY MATTER TIS METHINKS A VIRTUE TO WHICH I WHO AM NO CONJUROR COULD WITHOUT ANY GREAT ENDEAVOUR ARRIVE
8097-108005-0007 WHAT THEN IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM THEM THAT WOULD YET PUT INTO CONSIDERATION THE GLORY ATTENDING THIS REFUSAL WHEREIN THERE MAY LURK WORSE AMBITION THAN EVEN IN THE DESIRE ITSELF
8097-108005-0008 AND FRUITION OF GREATNESS FORASMUCH AS AMBITION NEVER COMPORTS ITSELF BETTER ACCORDING TO ITSELF THAN WHEN IT PROCEEDS BY OBSCURE AND UNFREQUENTED WAYS
8097-108005-0009 I INCITE MY COURAGE TO PATIENCE BUT I REIN IT AS MUCH AS I CAN TOWARDS DESIRE I HAVE AS MUCH TO WISH FOR AS ANOTHER AND ALLOW MY WISHES AS MUCH LIBERTY AND INDISCRETION
8097-108005-0010 BUT YET IT NEVER BEFELL ME TO WISH FOR EITHER EMPIRE OR ROYALTY OR THE EMINENCY OF THOSE HIGH AND COMMANDING FORTUNES I DO NOT AIM THAT WAY I LOVE MYSELF TOO WELL
8097-108005-0011 WHEN I THINK TO GROW GREATER TIS BUT VERY MODERATELY AND BY A COMPELLED AND TIMOROUS ADVANCEMENT SUCH AS IS PROPER FOR ME IN RESOLUTION IN PRUDENCE IN HEALTH IN BEAUTY
8097-108005-0012 AND EVEN IN RICHES TOO BUT THIS SUPREME REPUTATION THIS MIGHTY AUTHORITY OPPRESS MY IMAGINATION AND QUITE CONTRARY TO THAT OTHER JULIUS CAESAR I SHOULD PERADVENTURE RATHER CHOOSE TO BE
8097-108005-0013 THE SECOND OR THIRD IN PERIGORD THAN THE FIRST AT PARIS AT LEAST WITHOUT LYING RATHER THE THIRD AT PARIS THAN THE FIRST
8097-108005-0014 I WOULD NEITHER DISPUTE WITH A PORTER A MISERABLE UNKNOWN NOR MAKE CROWDS OPEN IN ADORATION AS I PASS I AM TRAINED UP TO A MODERATE CONDITION
8097-108005-0015 ALL NATURAL CONSTITUTION IS EQUALLY JUST AND EASY MY SOUL IS SUCH A POLTROON THAT I MEASURE NOT GOOD FORTUNE BY THE HEIGHT BUT BY THE FACILITY
8097-108005-0016 BUT IF MY HEART BE NOT GREAT ENOUGH TIS OPEN ENOUGH TO MAKE AMENDS AT ANY ONE'S REQUEST FREELY TO LAY OPEN ITS WEAKNESS
8097-108005-0017 SHOULD ANY ONE PUT ME UPON COMPARING THE LIFE OF L THORIUS BALBUS A BRAVE MAN HANDSOME LEARNED HEALTHFUL UNDERSTANDING AND ABOUNDING IN ALL SORTS OF CONVENIENCES AND PLEASURES
8097-108005-0018 LEADING A QUIET LIFE AND ALL HIS OWN HIS MIND WELL PREPARED AGAINST DEATH SUPERSTITION PAIN AND OTHER INCUMBRANCES OF HUMAN NECESSITY DYING AT LAST IN BATTLE WITH HIS SWORD IN HIS HAND
8097-108005-0019 FOR THE DEFENCE OF HIS COUNTRY ON THE ONE PART AND ON THE OTHER PART THE LIFE OF M REGULUS
8097-108005-0020 END ADMIRABLE THE ONE WITHOUT NAME AND WITHOUT DIGNITY THE OTHER EXEMPLARY AND GLORIOUS TO A WONDER I SHOULD DOUBTLESS SAY AS CICERO DID COULD I SPEAK AS WELL AS HE
8097-108005-0021 BUT IF I WAS TO COMPARE THEM WITH MY OWN I SHOULD THEN ALSO SAY THAT THE FIRST IS AS MUCH ACCORDING TO MY CAPACITY AND FROM DESIRE WHICH I CONFORM TO MY CAPACITY AS THE SECOND IS FAR BEYOND IT
8097-108005-0022 THAT I COULD NOT APPROACH THE LAST BUT WITH VENERATION THE OTHER I COULD READILY ATTAIN BY USE LET US RETURN TO OUR TEMPORAL GREATNESS FROM WHICH WE ARE DIGRESSED
8097-108005-0023 I DISRELISH ALL DOMINION WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
8097-108005-0024 DID AS I SHOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DONE WHICH WAS THAT HE GAVE UP TO HIS COMPETITORS HIS RIGHT OF BEING PROMOTED TO IT EITHER BY ELECTION OR BY LOT PROVIDED THAT HE AND HIS MIGHT LIVE IN THE EMPIRE
8097-108005-0025 OUT OF ALL AUTHORITY AND SUBJECTION THOSE OF THE ANCIENT LAWS EXCEPTED AND MIGHT ENJOY ALL LIBERTY THAT WAS NOT PREJUDICIAL TO THESE BEING AS IMPATIENT OF COMMANDING AS OF BEING COMMANDED
8097-108005-0026 THE MOST PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT EMPLOYMENT IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION IS WORTHILY TO DISCHARGE THE OFFICE OF A KING I EXCUSE MORE OF THEIR MISTAKES THAN MEN COMMONLY DO
8097-108005-0027 IN CONSIDERATION OF THE INTOLERABLE WEIGHT OF THEIR FUNCTION WHICH ASTOUNDS ME TIS HARD TO KEEP MEASURE IN SO IMMEASURABLE A POWER YET SO IT IS THAT IT IS
8097-108005-0028 EVEN TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT OF THE BEST NATURE A SINGULAR INCITEMENT TO VIRTUE TO BE SEATED IN A PLACE WHERE YOU CANNOT DO THE LEAST GOOD THAT SHALL NOT BE PUT UPON RECORD
8097-108005-0029 AND WHERE THE LEAST BENEFIT REDOUNDS TO SO MANY MEN AND WHERE YOUR TALENT OF ADMINISTRATION LIKE THAT OF PREACHERS PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSES ITSELF TO THE PEOPLE NO VERY EXACT JUDGE
8097-108005-0030 EASY TO DECEIVE AND EASILY CONTENT THERE ARE FEW THINGS WHEREIN WE CAN GIVE A SINCERE JUDGMENT BY REASON THAT THERE ARE FEW WHEREIN WE HAVE NOT IN SOME SORT A PRIVATE INTEREST
8097-108005-0031 SUPERIORITY AND INFERIORITY DOMINION AND SUBJECTION ARE BOUND TO A NATURAL ENVY AND CONTEST AND MUST OF NECESSITY PERPETUALLY INTRENCH UPON ONE ANOTHER
8097-108005-0032 I BELIEVE NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER TOUCHING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER PARTY LET REASON THEREFORE WHICH IS INFLEXIBLE AND WITHOUT PASSION DETERMINE WHEN WE CAN AVAIL OURSELVES OF IT
8097-108005-0033 TWO SCOTTISH AUTHORS CONTENDING UPON THIS SUBJECT OF WHOM HE WHO STANDS FOR THE PEOPLE MAKES THE KING TO BE IN A WORSE CONDITION THAN A CARTER HE WHO WRITES FOR MONARCHY PLACES HIM SOME DEGREES ABOVE GOD IN POWER AND SOVEREIGNTY
8097-108005-0034 THAN THE TRIALS THAT WE MAKE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER OUT OF EMULATION OF HONOUR AND WORTH WHETHER IN THE EXERCISES OF THE BODY OR IN THOSE OF THE MIND WHEREIN SOVEREIGN GREATNESS CAN HAVE NO TRUE PART
8097-108005-0035 AND IN EARNEST I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT BY FORCE OF RESPECT ITSELF MEN USE PRINCES DISDAINFULLY AND INJURIOUSLY IN THAT PARTICULAR FOR THE THING I WAS INFINITELY OFFENDED AT IN MY CHILDHOOD
8097-108005-0036 THAT THEY WHO EXERCISED WITH ME FORBORE TO DO THEIR BEST BECAUSE THEY FOUND ME UNWORTHY OF THEIR UTMOST ENDEAVOUR IS WHAT WE SEE HAPPEN TO THEM DAILY EVERY ONE FINDING HIMSELF UNWORTHY TO CONTEND WITH THEM
8097-108005-0037 IF WE DISCOVER THAT THEY HAVE THE LEAST DESIRE TO GET THE BETTER OF US
8097-108005-0038 AND WHO WILL NOT RATHER BETRAY HIS OWN GLORY THAN OFFEND THEIRS AND WILL THEREIN EMPLOY SO MUCH FORCE ONLY AS IS NECESSARY TO SAVE THEIR HONOUR WHAT SHARE HAVE THEY THEN IN THE ENGAGEMENT
8097-108005-0039 WHERE EVERY ONE IS ON THEIR SIDE METHINKS I SEE THOSE PALADINS OF ANCIENT TIMES PRESENTING THEMSELVES TO JOUSTS AND BATTLE
8097-108005-0040 BUT HE OUGHT TO HAVE HAD HIM WHIPPED
8097-108005-0041 LEARNED NOTHING RIGHT BUT TO MANAGE HORSES BY REASON THAT IN ALL THEIR OTHER EXERCISES EVERY ONE BENDS AND YIELDS TO THEM BUT A HORSE THAT IS NEITHER A FLATTERER NOR A COURTIER THROWS THE SON OF A KING
8097-108005-0042 WITH NO MORE CEREMONY THAN HE WOULD THROW THAT OF A PORTER HOMER WAS FAIN TO CONSENT THAT VENUS SO SWEET AND DELICATE A GODDESS AS SHE WAS SHOULD BE WOUNDED AT THE BATTLE OF TROY
8097-108005-0043 THEREBY TO ASCRIBE COURAGE AND BOLDNESS TO HER QUALITIES THAT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE IN THOSE WHO ARE EXEMPT FROM DANGER THE GODS ARE MADE TO BE ANGRY TO FEAR TO RUN AWAY TO BE JEALOUS TO GRIEVE
8097-108005-0044 TO BE TRANSPORTED WITH PASSIONS TO HONOUR THEM WITH THE VIRTUES THAT AMONGST US ARE BUILT UPON THESE IMPERFECTIONS WHO DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE HAZARD AND DIFFICULTY
8097-108005-0045 THAT ALL THINGS MUST GIVE WAY TO HIM FORTUNE THEREIN SETS YOU TOO REMOTE FROM SOCIETY AND PLACES YOU IN TOO GREAT A SOLITUDE THIS EASINESS AND MEAN FACILITY OF MAKING ALL THINGS BOW UNDER YOU
8097-108005-0046 IS AN ENEMY TO ALL SORTS OF PLEASURE TIS TO SLIDE NOT TO GO TIS TO SLEEP AND NOT TO LIVE CONCEIVE MAN ACCOMPANIED WITH OMNIPOTENCE
8097-108005-0047 YOU OVERWHELM HIM HE MUST BEG DISTURBANCE AND OPPOSITION AS AN ALMS HIS BEING AND HIS GOOD ARE IN INDIGENCE EVIL TO MAN IS IN ITS TURN GOOD AND GOOD
8097-108005-0048 EVIL NEITHER IS PAIN ALWAYS TO BE SHUNNED NOR PLEASURE ALWAYS TO BE PURSUED THEIR GOOD QUALITIES ARE DEAD AND LOST
8097-108005-0049 FOR THEY CAN ONLY BE PERCEIVED BY COMPARISON AND WE PUT THEM OUT OF THIS THEY HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE PRAISE HAVING THEIR EARS DEAFENED WITH SO CONTINUAL AND UNIFORM AN APPROBATION
8097-108005-0050 HAVE THEY TO DO WITH THE STUPIDEST OF ALL THEIR SUBJECTS THEY HAVE NO MEANS TO TAKE ANY ADVANTAGE OF HIM IF HE BUT SAY TIS BECAUSE HE IS MY KING
8097-108005-0051 HE THINKS HE HAS SAID ENOUGH TO EXPRESS THAT HE THEREFORE SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE OVERCOME THIS QUALITY STIFLES AND CONSUMES THE OTHER TRUE AND ESSENTIAL QUALITIES THEY ARE SUNK IN THE ROYALTY
8097-108005-0052 THE OUTER GLARE THAT ENVIRONS HIM CONCEALS AND SHROUDS HIM FROM US OUR SIGHT IS THERE REPELLED AND DISSIPATED BEING FILLED AND STOPPED BY THIS PREVAILING LIGHT
8097-108005-0053 THE SENATE AWARDED THE PRIZE OF ELOQUENCE TO TIBERIUS HE REFUSED IT ESTEEMING THAT THOUGH IT HAD BEEN JUST HE COULD DERIVE NO ADVANTAGE FROM A JUDGMENT SO PARTIAL
8097-108005-0054 AND THAT WAS SO LITTLE FREE TO JUDGE AS WE GIVE THEM ALL ADVANTAGES OF HONOUR SO DO WE SOOTHE AND AUTHORISE ALL THEIR VICES AND DEFECTS
8097-108005-0055 NOT ONLY BY APPROBATION BUT BY IMITATION ALSO EVERY ONE OF ALEXANDER'S FOLLOWERS CARRIED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AS HE DID AND THE FLATTERERS OF DIONYSIUS
8097-108005-0056 AND STUMBLED AT AND OVERTURNED WHATEVER WAS UNDER FOOT
8097-108005-0057 I HAVE SEEN DEAFNESS AFFECTED AND BECAUSE THE MASTER HATED HIS WIFE PLUTARCH
8097-108005-0058 HAS SEEN HIS COURTIERS REPUDIATE THEIRS WHOM THEY LOVED
8097-108005-0059 WHO AS THEIR MASTER PRETENDED TO THE HONOUR OF A GOOD PHYSICIAN CAME TO HIM TO HAVE INCISIONS AND CAUTERIES MADE IN THEIR LIMBS FOR THESE OTHERS SUFFERED THE SOUL A MORE DELICATE AND NOBLE PART TO BE CAUTERISED
8097-108005-0060 BUT TO END WHERE I BEGAN THE EMPEROR ADRIAN DISPUTING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER FAVORINUS ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF SOME WORD
8097-108005-0061 FAVORINUS SOON YIELDED HIM THE VICTORY FOR WHICH HIS FRIENDS REBUKING HIM YOU TALK SIMPLY SAID HE WOULD YOU NOT HAVE HIM WISER THAN I WHO COMMANDS THIRTY LEGIONS AUGUSTUS WROTE VERSES AGAINST ASINIUS
8097-108005-0062 POLLIO AND I SAID POLLIO SAY NOTHING FOR IT IS NOT PRUDENCE TO WRITE IN CONTEST WITH HIM WHO HAS POWER TO PROSCRIBE AND THEY WERE RIGHT
