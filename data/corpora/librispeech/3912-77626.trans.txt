3912-77626-0000 WHAT A SINGULAR MOMENT IS THE FIRST ONE WHEN YOU HAVE HARDLY BEGUN TO RECOLLECT YOURSELF AFTER STARTING FROM MIDNIGHT SLUMBER BY UNCLOSING YOUR EYES SO SUDDENLY
3912-77626-0001 YOU SEEM TO HAVE SURPRISED THE PERSONAGES OF YOUR DREAM IN FULL CONVOCATION ROUND YOUR BED
3912-77626-0002 OR TO VARY THE METAPHOR YOU FIND YOURSELF FOR A SINGLE INSTANT WIDE AWAKE IN THAT REALM OF ILLUSIONS WHITHER SLEEP HAS BEEN THE PASSPORT AND BEHOLD ITS GHOSTLY INHABITANTS AND WONDROUS SCENERY WITH A PERCEPTION OF THEIR STRANGENESS
3912-77626-0003 SUCH AS YOU NEVER ATTAIN WHILE THE DREAM IS UNDISTURBED THE DISTANT SOUND OF A CHURCH CLOCK IS BORNE FAINTLY ON THE WIND YOU QUESTION WITH YOURSELF HALF SERIOUSLY
3912-77626-0004 WHETHER IT HAS STOLEN TO YOUR WAKING EAR FROM SOME GRAY TOWER THAT STOOD WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF YOUR DREAM WHILE YET IN SUSPENSE ANOTHER CLOCK FLINGS ITS HEAVY CLANG OVER THE SLUMBERING TOWN WITH
3912-77626-0005 SO FULL AND DISTINCT A SOUND AND SUCH A LONG MURMUR IN THE NEIGHBORING AIR THAT YOU ARE CERTAIN IT MUST PROCEED FROM THE STEEPLE AT THE NEAREST CORNER YOU COUNT THE STROKES ONE TWO
3912-77626-0006 AND THERE THEY CEASE WITH A BOOMING SOUND LIKE THE GATHERING OF A THIRD STROKE WITHIN THE BELL IF YOU COULD CHOOSE AN HOUR OF WAKEFULNESS OUT OF THE WHOLE NIGHT IT WOULD BE THIS SINCE YOUR SOBER BEDTIME AT ELEVEN
3912-77626-0007 YOU HAVE HAD REST ENOUGH TO TAKE OFF THE PRESSURE OF YESTERDAY'S FATIGUE WHILE BEFORE YOU TILL THE SUN COMES FROM FAR CATHAY TO BRIGHTEN YOUR WINDOW
3912-77626-0008 AND TWO IN THAT STRANGEST OF ENJOYMENTS THE FORGETFULNESS ALIKE OF JOY AND WOE THE MOMENT OF RISING BELONGS TO ANOTHER PERIOD OF TIME AND APPEARS SO DISTANT THAT THE PLUNGE OUT OF A WARM BED INTO THE FROSTY AIR
3912-77626-0009 CANNOT YET BE ANTICIPATED WITH DISMAY YESTERDAY HAS ALREADY VANISHED AMONG THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST TO MORROW HAS NOT YET EMERGED FROM THE FUTURE YOU HAVE FOUND AN INTERMEDIATE SPACE WHERE THE BUSINESS OF LIFE DOES NOT INTRUDE
3912-77626-0010 WHERE THE PASSING MOMENT LINGERS AND BECOMES TRULY THE PRESENT A SPOT WHERE FATHER TIME WHEN HE THINKS NOBODY IS WATCHING HIM SITS DOWN BY THE WAYSIDE TO TAKE BREATH
3912-77626-0011 BECAUSE THE SLIGHTEST MOTION WOULD DISSIPATE THE FRAGMENTS OF YOUR SLUMBER NOW BEING IRREVOCABLY AWAKE YOU PEEP THROUGH THE HALF DRAWN WINDOW CURTAIN AND OBSERVE THAT THE GLASS IS ORNAMENTED WITH FANCIFUL DEVICES IN FROST WORK
3912-77626-0012 AND THAT EACH PANE PRESENTS SOMETHING LIKE A FROZEN DREAM THERE WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO TRACE OUT THE ANALOGY WHILE WAITING THE SUMMONS TO BREAKFAST
3912-77626-0013 SEEN THROUGH THE CLEAR PORTION OF THE GLASS WHERE THE SILVERY MOUNTAIN PEAKS OF THE FROST SCENERY DO NOT ASCEND THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OBJECT IS THE STEEPLE
3912-77626-0014 YOU MAY ALMOST DISTINGUISH THE FIGURES ON THE CLOCK THAT HAS JUST TOLD THE HOUR SUCH A FROSTY SKY AND THE SNOW COVERED ROOFS AND THE LONG VISTA OF THE FROZEN STREET ALL WHITE
3912-77626-0015 AND THE DISTANT WATER HARDENED INTO ROCK MIGHT MAKE YOU SHIVER EVEN UNDER FOUR BLANKETS AND A WOOLLEN COMFORTER YET LOOK AT THAT ONE GLORIOUS STAR ITS BEAMS ARE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM ALL THE REST
3912-77626-0016 IT IS TOO COLD EVEN FOR THE THOUGHTS TO VENTURE ABROAD YOU SPECULATE ON THE LUXURY OF WEARING OUT A WHOLE EXISTENCE IN BED LIKE AN OYSTER IN ITS SHELL
3912-77626-0017 CONTENT WITH THE SLUGGISH ECSTASY OF INACTION AND DROWSILY CONSCIOUS OF NOTHING BUT DELICIOUS WARMTH SUCH AS YOU NOW FEEL AGAIN AH THAT IDEA HAS BROUGHT A HIDEOUS ONE IN ITS TRAIN
3912-77626-0018 YOU THINK HOW THE DEAD ARE LYING IN THEIR COLD SHROUDS AND NARROW COFFINS THROUGH THE DREAR WINTER OF THE GRAVE AND CANNOT PERSUADE YOUR FANCY THAT THEY NEITHER SHRINK NOR SHIVER
3912-77626-0019 WHEN THE SNOW IS DRIFTING OVER THEIR LITTLE HILLOCKS AND THE BITTER BLAST HOWLS AGAINST THE DOOR OF THE TOMB THAT GLOOMY THOUGHT WILL COLLECT A GLOOMY MULTITUDE AND THROW ITS COMPLEXION OVER YOUR WAKEFUL HOUR
3912-77626-0020 IN THE DEPTHS OF EVERY HEART THERE IS A TOMB AND A DUNGEON THOUGH THE LIGHTS THE MUSIC AND REVELRY ABOVE MAY CAUSE US TO FORGET THEIR EXISTENCE AND THE BURIED ONES OR PRISONERS WHOM THEY HIDE
3912-77626-0021 BUT SOMETIMES AND OFTENEST AT MIDNIGHT THOSE DARK RECEPTACLES ARE FLUNG WIDE OPEN IN AN HOUR LIKE THIS WHEN THE MIND HAS A PASSIVE SENSIBILITY BUT NO ACTIVE STRENGTH
3912-77626-0022 WHEN THE IMAGINATION IS A MIRROR IMPARTING VIVIDNESS TO ALL IDEAS WITHOUT THE POWER OF SELECTING OR CONTROLLING THEM THEN PRAY THAT YOUR GRIEFS MAY SLUMBER AND THE BROTHERHOOD OF REMORSE NOT BREAK THEIR CHAIN
3912-77626-0023 IT IS TOO LATE A FUNERAL TRAIN COMES GLIDING BY YOUR BED IN WHICH PASSION AND FEELING ASSUME BODILY SHAPE AND THINGS OF THE MIND BECOME DIM SPECTRES TO THE EYE
3912-77626-0024 THERE IS YOUR EARLIEST SORROW A PALE YOUNG MOURNER WEARING A SISTER'S LIKENESS TO FIRST LOVE SADLY BEAUTIFUL WITH A HALLOWED SWEETNESS IN HER MELANCHOLY FEATURES AND GRACE IN THE FLOW OF HER SABLE ROBE
3912-77626-0025 NEXT APPEARS A SHADE OF RUINED LOVELINESS WITH DUST AMONG HER GOLDEN HAIR AND HER BRIGHT GARMENTS ALL FADED AND DEFACED STEALING FROM YOUR GLANCE WITH DROOPING HEAD AS FEARFUL OF REPROACH
3912-77626-0026 BUT A DELUSIVE ONE SO CALL HER DISAPPOINTMENT NOW A STERNER FORM SUCCEEDS WITH A BROW OF WRINKLES A LOOK AND GESTURE OF IRON AUTHORITY THERE IS NO NAME FOR HIM UNLESS IT BE FATALITY
3912-77626-0027 AN EMBLEM OF THE EVIL INFLUENCE THAT RULES YOUR FORTUNES A DEMON TO WHOM YOU SUBJECTED YOURSELF BY SOME ERROR AT THE OUTSET OF LIFE AND WERE BOUND HIS SLAVE FOR EVER BY ONCE OBEYING HIM
3912-77626-0028 SEE THOSE FIENDISH LINEAMENTS GRAVEN ON THE DARKNESS
3912-77626-0029 THE POINTED FINGER TOUCHING THE SORE PLACE IN YOUR HEART DO YOU REMEMBER ANY ACT OF ENORMOUS FOLLY AT WHICH YOU WOULD BLUSH EVEN IN THE REMOTEST CAVERN OF THE EARTH THEN RECOGNIZE YOUR SHAME
3912-77626-0030 PASS WRETCHED BAND WELL FOR THE WAKEFUL ONE IF RIOTOUSLY MISERABLE A FIERCER TRIBE DO NOT SURROUND HIM
3912-77626-0031 WHAT IF REMORSE SHOULD ASSUME THE FEATURES OF AN INJURED FRIEND WHAT IF THE FIEND SHOULD COME IN WOMAN'S GARMENTS WITH A PALE BEAUTY AMID SIN AND DESOLATION AND LIE DOWN BY YOUR SIDE
3912-77626-0032 WHAT IF HE SHOULD STAND AT YOUR BED'S FOOT IN THE LIKENESS OF A CORPSE WITH A BLOODY STAIN UPON THE SHROUD SUFFICIENT WITHOUT SUCH GUILT IS THIS NIGHTMARE OF THE SOUL THIS HEAVY HEAVY SINKING OF THE SPIRITS
3912-77626-0033 THIS WINTRY GLOOM ABOUT THE HEART THIS INDISTINCT HORROR OF THE MIND BLENDING ITSELF WITH THE DARKNESS OF THE CHAMBER
3912-77626-0034 BY A DESPERATE EFFORT YOU START UPRIGHT BREAKING FROM A SORT OF CONSCIOUS SLEEP AND GAZING WILDLY ROUND THE BED AS IF THE FIENDS WERE ANYWHERE BUT IN YOUR HAUNTED MIND
3912-77626-0035 AT THE SAME MOMENT THE SLUMBERING EMBERS ON THE HEARTH SEND FORTH A GLEAM WHICH PALELY ILLUMINATES THE WHOLE OUTER ROOM AND FLICKERS THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE BEDCHAMBER BUT CANNOT QUITE DISPEL ITS OBSCURITY
3912-77626-0036 YOUR EYE SEARCHES FOR WHATEVER MAY REMIND YOU OF THE LIVING WORLD
3912-77626-0037 THE BOOK WITH AN IVORY KNIFE BETWEEN ITS LEAVES THE UNFOLDED LETTER
3912-77626-0038 SOON THE FLAME VANISHES AND WITH IT THE WHOLE SCENE IS GONE THOUGH ITS IMAGE REMAINS AN INSTANT IN YOUR MIND'S EYE WHEN DARKNESS HAS SWALLOWED THE REALITY
3912-77626-0039 THROUGHOUT THE CHAMBER THERE IS THE SAME OBSCURITY AS BEFORE BUT NOT THE SAME GLOOM WITHIN YOUR BREAST AS YOUR HEAD FALLS BACK UPON THE PILLOW YOU THINK IN A WHISPER BE IT SPOKEN
3912-77626-0040 HOW PLEASANT IN THESE NIGHT SOLITUDES WOULD BE THE RISE AND FALL OF A SOFTER BREATHING THAN YOUR OWN THE SLIGHT PRESSURE OF A TENDERER BOSOM THE QUIET THROB OF A PURER HEART IMPARTING ITS PEACEFULNESS TO YOUR TROUBLED ONE
3912-77626-0041 AS IF THE FOND SLEEPER WERE INVOLVING YOU IN HER DREAM HER INFLUENCE IS OVER YOU THOUGH SHE HAVE NO EXISTENCE BUT IN THAT MOMENTARY IMAGE
3912-77626-0042 YOU SINK DOWN IN A FLOWERY SPOT ON THE BORDERS OF SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS WHILE YOUR THOUGHTS RISE BEFORE YOU IN PICTURES ALL DISCONNECTED YET ALL ASSIMILATED BY A PERVADING GLADSOMENESS AND BEAUTY
3912-77626-0043 THE WHEELING OF GORGEOUS SQUADRONS THAT GLITTER IN THE SUN IS SUCCEEDED BY THE MERRIMENT OF CHILDREN ROUND THE DOOR OF A SCHOOLHOUSE BENEATH THE GLIMMERING SHADOW OF OLD TREES AT THE CORNER OF A RUSTIC LANE
3912-77626-0044 YOU STAND IN THE SUNNY RAIN OF A SUMMER SHOWER AND WANDER AMONG THE SUNNY TREES OF AN AUTUMNAL WOOD AND LOOK UPWARD AT THE BRIGHTEST OF ALL RAINBOWS OVERARCHING THE UNBROKEN SHEET OF SNOW ON THE AMERICAN SIDE OF NIAGARA
3912-77626-0045 AND THE TWITTERING FLIGHT OF BIRDS IN SPRING ABOUT THEIR NEW MADE NEST YOU FEEL THE MERRY BOUNDING OF A SHIP BEFORE THE BREEZE
3912-77626-0046 AND WATCH THE TUNEFUL FEET OF ROSY GIRLS AS THEY TWINE THEIR LAST AND MERRIEST DANCE IN A SPLENDID BALL ROOM AND FIND YOURSELF IN THE BRILLIANT CIRCLE OF A CROWDED THEATRE AS THE CURTAIN FALLS OVER A LIGHT AND AIRY SCENE
3912-77626-0047 WITH AN INVOLUNTARY START YOU SEIZE HOLD ON CONSCIOUSNESS AND PROVE YOURSELF BUT HALF AWAKE BY RUNNING A DOUBTFUL PARALLEL BETWEEN HUMAN LIFE AND THE HOUR WHICH HAS NOW ELAPSED
3912-77626-0048 IN BOTH YOU EMERGE FROM MYSTERY PASS THROUGH A VICISSITUDE THAT YOU CAN BUT IMPERFECTLY CONTROL AND ARE BORNE ONWARD TO ANOTHER MYSTERY
3912-77626-0049 NOW COMES THE PEAL OF THE DISTANT CLOCK WITH FAINTER AND FAINTER STROKES AS YOU PLUNGE FARTHER INTO THE WILDERNESS OF SLEEP IT IS THE KNELL OF A TEMPORARY DEATH YOUR SPIRIT HAS DEPARTED
3912-77626-0050 AND STRAYS LIKE A FREE CITIZEN AMONG THE PEOPLE OF A SHADOWY WORLD BEHOLDING STRANGE SIGHTS YET WITHOUT WONDER OR DISMAY
