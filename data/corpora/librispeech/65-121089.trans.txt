65-121089-0010 THE ANSWER WAS SO LITTLE LIKE THE ONE MERCEDES DESIRED THAT SHE TURNED AWAY TO GIVE VENT TO A SIGH WHICH SOUNDED MORE LIKE A GROAN THANK YOU SHE SAID AND THEY WALKED ON AGAIN
65-121089-0011 THEY WENT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE GARDEN WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD SIR SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED THE COUNTESS AFTER THEIR WALK HAD CONTINUED TEN MINUTES IN SILENCE IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE SEEN SO MUCH TRAVELLED SO FAR AND SUFFERED SO DEEPLY
