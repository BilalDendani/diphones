8389-120181-0000 MANY OF MY READERS WILL REMEMBER THE MYSTERIOUS RADIO MESSAGES WHICH WERE HEARD BY BOTH AMATEUR AND PROFESSIONAL SHORT WAVE OPERATORS DURING THE NIGHTS OF THE TWENTY THIRD AND TWENTY FOURTH OF LAST SEPTEMBER
8389-120181-0001 AND EVEN MORE WILL REMEMBER THE ASTOUNDING DISCOVERY MADE BY PROFESSOR MONTESCUE OF THE LICK OBSERVATORY ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH AT THE TIME SOME INSPIRED WRITERS TRIED TO CONNECT THE TWO EVENTS MAINTAINING THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THE FACT THAT THE EARTH HAD A NEW SATELLITE
8389-120181-0002 COINCIDENT WITH THE RECEIPT OF THE MYSTERIOUS MESSAGES WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE NEW PLANETOID WAS INHABITED AND THAT THE MESSAGES WERE ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE INHABITANTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH US
8389-120181-0003 AND THE ADDITIONAL FACT THAT THEY APPEARED TO COME FROM AN IMMENSE DISTANCE LENT A CERTAIN AIR OF PLAUSIBILITY TO THESE EBULLITIONS IN THE SUNDAY MAGAZINE SECTIONS FOR SOME WEEKS THE FEATURE WRITERS HARPED ON THE SUBJECT
8389-120181-0004 BUT THE HURRIED CONSTRUCTION OF NEW RECEIVERS WHICH WOULD WORK ON A LOWER WAVE LENGTH YIELDED NO RESULTS AND THE SOLEMN PRONOUNCEMENTS OF ASTRONOMERS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE NEW CELESTIAL BODY COULD BY NO POSSIBILITY HAVE AN ATMOSPHERE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS SMALL SIZE FINALLY PUT AN END TO THE TALK
8389-120181-0005 SO THE MATTER LAPSED INTO OBLIVION
8389-120181-0006 HE WAS A MAN OF SOME LOCAL PROMINENCE BUT HE HAD NO MORE THAN A LOCAL FAME AND FEW PAPERS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN NOTED THE EVENT IN THEIR COLUMNS I DO NOT THINK THAT ANYONE EVER TRIED TO CONNECT UP HIS DISAPPEARANCE WITH THE RADIO MESSAGES OR THE DISCOVERY OF THE NEW EARTHLY SATELLITE
8389-120181-0007 YET THE THREE EVENTS WERE CLOSELY BOUND UP TOGETHER
8389-120181-0008 DOCTOR LIVERMORE TAUGHT PHYSICS AT CALVADA OR AT LEAST HE TAUGHT THE SUBJECT WHEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD A CLASS AND FELT LIKE TEACHING HIS STUDENTS NEVER KNEW WHETHER HE WOULD APPEAR AT CLASS OR NOT BUT HE ALWAYS PASSED EVERYONE WHO TOOK HIS COURSES AND SO OF COURSE THEY WERE ALWAYS CROWDED
8389-120181-0009 THE UNIVERSITY AUTHORITIES USED TO REMONSTRATE WITH HIM BUT HIS ABILITY AS A RESEARCH WORKER WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND RECOGNIZED THAT HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO ABOUT AS HE PLEASED HE WAS A BACHELOR WHO LIVED ALONE AND WHO HAD NO INTERESTS IN LIFE SO FAR AS ANYONE KNEW OTHER THAN HIS WORK
8389-120181-0010 I FIRST MADE CONTACT WITH HIM WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN AT CALVADA AND FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON HE TOOK A LIKING TO ME MY FATHER HAD INSISTED THAT I FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER
8389-120181-0011 AS HE WAS PAYING MY BILLS I HAD TO MAKE A SHOW AT STUDYING ENGINEERING WHILE I CLANDESTINELY PURSUED MY HOBBY LITERATURE DOCTOR LIVERMORE'S COURSES WERE THE EASIEST IN THE SCHOOL AND THEY COUNTED AS SCIENCE SO I REGULARLY REGISTERED FOR THEM CUT THEM AND ATTENDED A CLASS IN LITERATURE AS AN AUDITOR
8389-120181-0012 THE DOCTOR USED TO MEET ME ON THE CAMPUS AND LAUGHINGLY SCOLD ME FOR MY ABSENCE BUT HE WAS REALLY IN SYMPATHY WITH MY AMBITION AND HE REGULARLY GAVE ME A PASSING MARK AND MY UNITS OF CREDIT WITHOUT REGARD TO MY ATTENDANCE OR RATHER LACK OF IT WHEN I GRADUATED FROM CALVADA I WAS THEORETICALLY AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER
8389-120181-0013 PRACTICALLY I HAD A PRETTY GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE AND KNEW ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT MY SO CALLED PROFESSION I STALLED AROUND DAD'S OFFICE FOR A FEW MONTHS UNTIL I LANDED A JOB AS A CUB REPORTER ON THE SAN FRANCISCO GRAPHIC AND THEN I QUIT HIM COLD
8389-120181-0014 WHEN THE STORM BLEW OVER DAD ADMITTED THAT YOU COULDN'T MAKE A SILK PURSE OUT OF A SOW'S EAR AND AGREED WITH A GRUNT TO MY NEW LINE OF WORK HE SAID THAT I WOULD PROBABLY BE A BETTER REPORTER THAN AN ENGINEER BECAUSE I COULDN'T BY ANY POSSIBILITY BE A WORSE ONE AND LET IT GO AT THAT
8389-120181-0015 HOWEVER ALL THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY IT JUST EXPLAINS HOW I CAME TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH DOCTOR LIVERMORE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHY HE SENT FOR ME ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND IN THE SECOND PLACE THE MORNING OF THE TWENTY SECOND THE CITY EDITOR CALLED ME IN AND ASKED ME IF I KNEW OLD LIVERPILLS
8389-120181-0016 WENT ON BARNES I OFFERED TO SEND OUT A GOOD MAN FOR WHEN OLD LIVERPILLS STARTS A STORY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD BUT ALL I GOT WAS A HIGH POWERED BAWLING OUT
8389-120181-0017 YOU'D BETTER TAKE A RUN OUT TO CALVADA AND SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY
8389-120181-0018 I WAS MORE OR LESS USED TO THAT SORT OF TALK FROM BARNES SO I PAID NO ATTENTION TO IT I DROVE MY FLIVVER DOWN TO CALVADA AND ASKED FOR THE DOCTOR DOCTOR LIVERMORE SAID THE BURSAR WHY HE HASN'T BEEN AROUND HERE FOR THE LAST TEN MONTHS
8389-120181-0019 YOU'LL HAVE TO GO THERE IF YOU WANT TO SEE HIM I KNEW BETTER THAN TO REPORT BACK TO BARNES WITHOUT THE STORY SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO IT BUT TO DRIVE UP TO HAT CREEK AND A LONG HARD DRIVE IT WAS I MADE REDDING LATE THAT NIGHT
8389-120181-0020 THE NEXT DAY I DROVE ON TO BURNEY AND ASKED FOR DIRECTIONS TO THE DOCTOR'S RANCH SO YOU'RE GOING UP TO DOC LIVERMORE'S ARE YOU ASKED THE POSTMASTER MY INFORMANT
8389-120181-0021 IT'S BEEN GOING ON EVER SINCE HE LANDED THERE
8389-120181-0022 FORCED TO BE SATISFIED WITH THIS MEAGER INFORMATION I STARTED OLD LIZZIE AND LIT OUT FOR THE RANCH AFTER I HAD TURNED OFF THE MAIN TRAIL I MET NO ONE UNTIL THE RANCH HOUSE WAS IN SIGHT
8389-120181-0023 AS I ROUNDED A BEND IN THE ROAD WHICH BROUGHT ME IN SIGHT OF THE BUILDING I WAS FORCED TO PUT ON MY BRAKES AT TOP SPEED TO AVOID RUNNING INTO A CHAIN WHICH WAS STRETCHED ACROSS THE ROAD AN INDIAN ARMED WITH A WINCHESTER RIFLE STOOD BEHIND IT
8389-120181-0024 MY BUSINESS IS WITH DOCTOR LIVERMORE I SAID TARTLY YOU GOT LETTER HE INQUIRED NO I ANSWERED NO KETCHUM LETTER NO KETCHUM DOCTOR HE REPLIED AND WALKED STOLIDLY BACK TO HIS POST
8389-120181-0025 THIS IS ABSURD I SHOUTED AND DROVE LIZZIE UP TO THE CHAIN
8389-120181-0026 A THIRTY THIRTY BULLET EMBEDDED ITSELF IN THE POST AN INCH OR TWO FROM MY HEAD AND I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT TAKING DOWN THAT CHAIN NO KETCHUM LETTER NO KETCHUM DOCTOR SAID THE INDIAN LACONICALLY AS HE PUMPED ANOTHER SHELL INTO HIS GUN I WAS BALKED
8389-120181-0027 THE INDIAN GRUNTED AN ASSENT DOCTOR LIVERMORE TELEPHONED ME TO COME AND SEE HIM I SAID CAN'T I CALL HIM UP AND SEE IF HE STILL WANTS TO SEE ME
8389-120181-0028 I CRANKED THE OLD COFFEE MILL TYPE OF TELEPHONE WHICH I FOUND AND PRESENTLY HEARD THE VOICE OF DOCTOR LIVERMORE THIS IS TOM FABER DOCTOR I SAID THE GRAPHIC SENT ME UP TO GET A STORY FROM YOU BUT THERE'S AN INDIAN HERE WHO STARTED TO MURDER ME WHEN I TRIED TO GET PAST YOUR BARRICADE
8389-120181-0029 GOOD FOR HIM CHUCKLED THE DOCTOR I HEARD THE SHOT BUT DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE WAS SHOOTING AT YOU TELL HIM TO TALK TO ME THE INDIAN TOOK THE TELEPHONE AT MY BIDDING AND LISTENED FOR A MINUTE YOU GO IN
8389-120181-0030 HE TOOK DOWN THE CHAIN AND I DROVE ON UP TO THE HOUSE TO FIND THE DOCTOR WAITING FOR ME ON THE VERANDA HELLO TOM HE GREETED ME HEARTILY SO YOU HAD TROUBLE WITH MY GUARD DID YOU I NEARLY GOT MURDERED I SAID RUEFULLY
8389-120181-0031 HE REMARKED CHEERFULLY I FORGOT TO TELL HIM THAT YOU WERE COMING TO DAY I TOLD HIM YOU WOULD BE HERE YESTERDAY BUT YESTERDAY ISN'T TO DAY TO THAT INDIAN I WASN'T SURE YOU WOULD GET HERE AT ALL IN POINT OF FACT FOR I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THAT OLD FOOL I TALKED TO IN YOUR OFFICE WOULD SEND YOU OR SOME ONE ELSE
8389-120181-0032 I HAVEN'T ONE I REPLIED I WENT TO CALVADA YESTERDAY TO SEE YOU AND DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL I GOT THERE THAT YOU WERE UP HERE THE DOCTOR CHUCKLED I GUESS I FORGOT TO TELL WHERE I WAS HE SAID THAT MAN I TALKED TO GOT ME SO MAD THAT I HUNG UP ON HIM BEFORE I TOLD HIM
8389-120181-0033 COME IN I FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE HOUSE AND HE SHOWED ME A ROOM FITTED WITH A CRUDE BUNK A WASHSTAND A BOWL AND A PITCHER YOU WON'T HAVE MANY LUXURIES HERE TOM HE SAID BUT YOU WON'T NEED TO STAY HERE FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS MY WORK IS DONE I AM READY TO START
8389-120181-0034 NOW DON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS IT'S NEARLY LUNCH TIME WHAT'S THE STORY DOCTOR I ASKED AFTER LUNCH AS I PUFFED ONE OF HIS EXCELLENT CIGARS AND WHY DID YOU PICK ME TO TELL IT TO FOR SEVERAL REASONS HE REPLIED IGNORING MY FIRST QUESTION
8389-120181-0035 IN THE SECOND PLACE I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT YOU HAD THE GIFT OF VISION OR IMAGINATION AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO BELIEVE IN THE THIRD PLACE YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN I KNOW WHO HAD THE LITERARY ABILITY TO WRITE UP A GOOD STORY AND AT THE SAME TIME HAS THE SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND TO GRASP WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT
8389-120181-0036 UNDERSTAND THAT UNLESS I HAVE YOUR PROMISE NOT TO WRITE THIS STORY UNTIL I TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN NOT A WORD WILL I TELL YOU I REFLECTED FOR A MOMENT
8389-120181-0037 THE GRAPHIC WOULD EXPECT THE STORY WHEN I GOT BACK BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I KNEW THAT UNLESS I GAVE THE DESIRED PROMISE THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T TALK ALL RIGHT I ASSENTED I'LL PROMISE GOOD HE REPLIED IN THAT CASE I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
8389-120181-0038 IN POINT OF FACT I HAD OFTEN HARBORED SUCH A SUSPICION OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT HE WENT ON CHEERFULLY I AM CRAZY CRAZY AS A LOON WHICH BY THE WAY IS A HIGHLY SENSIBLE BIRD WITH A WELL BALANCED MENTALITY THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT I AM CRAZY BUT MY CRAZINESS IS NOT OF THE USUAL TYPE
8389-120181-0039 MINE IS THE INSANITY OF GENIUS HE LOOKED AT ME SHARPLY AS HE SPOKE BUT LONG SESSIONS AT POKER IN THE SAN FRANCISCO PRESS CLUB HAD TAUGHT ME HOW TO CONTROL MY FACIAL MUSCLES AND I NEVER BATTED AN EYE HE SEEMED SATISFIED AND WENT ON
8389-120181-0040 FROM YOUR COLLEGE WORK YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE LAWS OF MAGNETISM HE SAID PERHAPS CONSIDERING JUST WHAT YOUR COLLEGE CAREER REALLY WAS I MIGHT BETTER SAY THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THEM I JOINED WITH HIM IN HIS LAUGHTER
8389-120181-0041 IT WON'T REQUIRE A VERY DEEP KNOWLEDGE TO FOLLOW THE THREAD OF MY ARGUMENT HE WENT ON YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT THE FORCE OF MAGNETIC ATTRACTION IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCES SEPARATING THE MAGNET AND THE ATTRACTED PARTICLES
8389-120181-0042 AND ALSO THAT EACH MAGNETIZED PARTICLE HAD TWO POLES A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE POLE
8389-120181-0043 I NODDED CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THAT THE LAWS OF MAGNETISM INSOFAR AS CONCERNS THE RELATION BETWEEN DISTANCE AND POWER OF ATTRACTION ARE EXACTLY MATCHED BY THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO FORCES ENDS I INTERRUPTED BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY DOES NOT END
8389-120181-0044 HE SAID SHARPLY THAT IS THE CRUX OF THE DISCOVERY WHICH I HAVE MADE
8389-120181-0045 THE PARALLEL BETWEEN THE TWO GROWS CLOSER WITH EACH SUCCEEDING EXPERIMENT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT EACH MAGNETIZED PARTICLE HAS TWO POLES
