2581-157857-0000 PHILIP ROMILLY FOUND HIMSELF ALONE AT LAST WITH THE THINGS WHICH HE HAD CRAVED DARKNESS SOLITUDE THE RUSHING OF THE SALT WIND THE SENSE OF OPEN SPACES
2581-157857-0001 ON THE OTHER THE SHELTERED SIDE OF THE STEAMER LONG LINES OF PASSENGERS WERE STRETCHED IN WICKER CHAIRS SMOKING AND DRINKING THEIR COFFEE BUT WHERE HE WAS NO ONE CAME SAVE AN OCCASIONAL PROMENADER
2581-157857-0002 FOR A BRIEF ESCAPE FROM THE THRALL OF MEMORIES WHICH DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS HAD BECOME CHARGED WITH UNDREAMED OF HORRORS AND THERE WAS TO BE NO PEACE
2581-157857-0003 IN THE SHADOWY DARKNESS WHICH RESTED UPON THE WHITE CHURNED SEA FLYING PAST HIM HE SAW AGAIN WITH HORRIBLE DISTINCTNESS THE FACE THE FIGURE OF THE MAN WHO
2581-157857-0004 WITH A DESPERATE AND PASSIONATE HATRED HE SAW THE BROKEN PHOTOGRAPH THE GLASS SPLINTERED INTO A THOUSAND PIECES HE SAW THE MAN HIMSELF CHOKING SINKING DOWN BENEATH THE BLACK WATERS
2581-157857-0005 HEARD THE STIFLED CRY FROM HIS PALSIED LIPS SAW THE SLOW DAWNING AGONY OF DEATH IN HIS DISTORTED FEATURES SOME ONE WAS PLAYING A MANDOLIN DOWN IN THE SECOND CLASS HE HEARD THE FEET OF A DANCER UPON THE DECK THE LITTLE MURMUR OF APPLAUSE
2581-157857-0006 WELL AFTER ALL THIS WAS LIFE IT WAS A REBUKE OF FATE TO HIS OWN ILLOGICAL AND USELESS VAPOURINGS MEN DIED EVERY SECOND WHILST WOMEN DANCED AND NO ONE WHO KNEW LIFE HAD ANY CARE SAVE FOR THE MEASURE OF THEIR OWN DAYS
2581-157857-0007 SOME FREAKISH THOUGHT PLEADED STRIDENTLY HIS OWN JUSTIFICATION HIS MIND TRAVELLED BACK DOWN THE GLOOMY AVENUES OF HIS PAST ALONG THOSE LAST ACHING YEARS OF GRINDING AND UNDESERVED POVERTY
2581-157857-0008 HE REMEMBERED HIS UPBRINGING HIS WIDOWED MOTHER A WOMAN USED TO EVERY LUXURY STRUGGLING TO MAKE BOTH ENDS MEET IN A SUBURBAN STREET IN A HIRED COTTAGE FILLED WITH HIRED FURNITURE
2581-157857-0009 HE REMEMBERED HIS SCHOOLDAYS DEVOID OF POCKET MONEY UNABLE TO JOIN IN THE SPORTS OF OTHERS SLAVING WITH MELANCHOLY PERSEVERANCE FOR A SCHOLARSHIP TO LIGHTEN HIS MOTHER'S BURDEN ALWAYS THERE WAS THE SAME GHASTLY CRUSHING PENURIOUSNESS
2581-157857-0010 THE STRUGGLE TO MAKE A LIVING BEFORE HIS SCHOOLDAYS WERE WELL OVER
2581-157857-0011 THE SCANTY FOOD HE HAD EATEN THE NARROW DRIVING WAYS OF POVERTY CULMINATING IN HIS MOTHER'S DEATH AND HIS OWN FEAR HE AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN YEARS LEST THE MONEY FOR HER FUNERAL SHOULD NOT BE FORTHCOMING
2581-157857-0012 IF THERE WERE ANY HELL SURELY HE HAD LIVED IN IT THIS OTHER WHOSE FLAMES MOCKED HIM NOW COULD BE NO WORSE SIN CRIME HE REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF THE GIRL WHO DURING THESE LATTER YEARS HAD REPRESENTED TO HIM WHAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OF LIGHT IN LIFE
2581-157857-0013 HE REMEMBERED AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE COULD MEET THAT GHOSTLY IMAGE WHICH HAD RISEN FROM THE BLACK WATERS WITHOUT SHRINKING ALMOST CONTEMPTUOUSLY FATE HAD MOCKED HIM LONG ENOUGH IT WAS TIME INDEED THAT HE HELPED HIMSELF
2581-157857-0014 HE SWUNG AWAY FROM THE SOLITUDE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STEAMER PAUSED IN A SHELTERED SPOT WHILE HE LIT A CIGARETTE AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE MORE FREQUENTED WAYS A SOFT VOICE FROM AN INVISIBLE MASS OF FURS AND RUGS CALLED TO HIM
2581-157857-0015 I THINK HE HAS JUST BEEN TOLD THAT THERE IS A RIVAL CINEMA PRODUCER ON BOARD AND HE IS TRYING TO RUN HIM TO GROUND PHILIP SETTLED HIMSELF WITHOUT HESITATION IN THE VACANT PLACE ONE IS FORCED TO ENVY MISTER RAYMOND GREENE HE SIGHED
2581-157857-0016 WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN SHE ASKED HIM BUT YOU ARE A MANUFACTURER ARE YOU NOT SOMEHOW OR OTHER THAT SURPRISES ME AND ME HE ACKNOWLEDGED FRANKLY
2581-157857-0017 YOUNG OR OLD HE ANSWERED
2581-157857-0018 SHE TURNED IN HER CHAIR A LITTLE MORE TOWARDS HIM AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF EMPTY SPACES THE PALE SOFTNESS OF HER FACE SEEMED TO GAIN A NEW ATTRACTIVENESS WELL THAT DEPENDS SHE SAID REFLECTIVELY UPON WHAT THESE NEW THINGS MIGHT BE WHICH YOU DESIRE
2581-157857-0019 THEN I SHOULD SAY THAT NEW YORK IS THE ONE PLACE IN THE WORLD SHE TOLD HIM YOU ARE SPEAKING OF YOURSELF YES YOU HAVE AMBITIONS I AM SURE SHE CONTINUED TELL ME ARE THEY LITERARY

2581-157857-0023 THERE WERE ONE OR TWO SLUMBERING FORMS BUT MOST WERE EMPTY THERE WERE NO PROMENADERS IN SIGHT
2581-157857-0024 SHE ASKED HER VOICE STILL VERY LOW WHY I LEFT THE SALOON A LITTLE ABRUPTLY THIS EVENING WHY HE DEMANDED BECAUSE SHE WENT ON I COULD SEE THE EFFECT WHICH MISTER RAYMOND GREENE'S STORY HAD UPON YOU BECAUSE I ALSO WAS IN THAT TRAIN
2581-157857-0025 AND I HAVE BETTER EYESIGHT THAN MISTER GREENE YOU WERE ONE OF THE TWO MEN WHO WERE WALKING ALONG THE TOWPATH WELL HE MUTTERED YOU HAVE NOTHING TO TELL ME NOTHING SHE WAITED FOR A MOMENT
2581-157857-0026 SHE REMARKED IF I CANNOT TELL YOU THE TRUTH HE PROMISED I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU A LIE BUT APART FROM THAT I ADMIT NOTHING I DO NOT EVEN ADMIT THAT IT WAS I WHOM YOU SAW SHE LAID HER HAND UPON HIS
2581-157857-0027 THE TOUCH OF HER FINGERS WAS WONDERFUL COOL AND SOFT AND SOMEHOW REASSURING HE FELT A SENSE OF RELAXATION FELT THE STRAIN OF LIVING SUDDENLY GROW LESS YOU KNOW SHE SAID

2581-157857-0032 AT THE FAR END OF THE SHIP SHE CLUNG TO HIM ONCE OR TWICE AS THE WIND CAME BOOMING OVER THE FRESHENING WAVES SHE WEIGHED AND MEASURED HIS CRITICISMS OF THE PLAYS THEY SPOKE OF AND IN THE MAIN APPROVED OF THEM
2581-157857-0033 WHEN AT LAST SHE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE COMPANIONWAY AND BADE HIM GOOD NIGHT THE DECK WAS ALMOST DESERTED THEY WERE NEAR ONE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND HE SAW HER FACE MORE DISTINCTLY THAN HE HAD SEEN IT AT ALL REALISED MORE ADEQUATELY ITS WONDERFUL CHARM
2581-157857-0034 SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND A WOMAN'S SOFT AND DELICATE FINGERS YET CLASPING HIS WITH AN ALMOST VIRILE STRENGTH AND FRIENDLINESS SHE LEFT HIM WITH JUST THAT FEELING ABOUT HER THAT SHE WAS EXPANSIVE IN HER HEART HER SYMPATHIES
2581-157857-0035 EVEN HER BRAIN AND PECULIAR GIFTS OF APPREHENSION SHE LEFT HIM TOO WITH A CURIOUS SENSE OF RESTFULNESS
2581-157857-0036 AND HAD FOUND A SORELY NEEDED GUARDIAN HE ABANDONED WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT HIS INTENTION OF GOING TO THE SMOKING ROOM AND SITTING UP LATE
