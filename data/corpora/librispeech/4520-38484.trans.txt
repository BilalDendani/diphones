4520-38484-0000 IT IS FURTHERMORE REMARKABLE THAT THOUGH THE TWO STORIES ARE DISTINCT MY OWN AS IT WERE AND THIS OTHER THEY EQUALLY BEGAN IN A MANNER THE FIRST NIGHT OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH FRANK SALTRAM THE NIGHT I CAME BACK FROM WIMBLEDON
4520-38484-0001 SO AGITATED WITH A NEW SENSE OF LIFE THAT IN LONDON FOR THE VERY THRILL OF IT I COULD ONLY WALK HOME WALKING AND SWINGING MY STICK I OVERTOOK AT BUCKINGHAM GATE GEORGE GRAVENER
4520-38484-0002 AND GEORGE GRAVENER'S STORY MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEGUN WITH MY MAKING HIM AS OUR PATHS LAY TOGETHER COME HOME WITH ME FOR A TALK I DULY REMEMBER LET ME PARENTHESISE THAT IT WAS STILL MORE THAT OF ANOTHER PERSON
4520-38484-0003 TO A SECOND CHAPTER I HAD MUCH TO SAY TO HIM NONE THE LESS ABOUT MY VISIT TO THE MULVILLES WHOM HE MORE INDIFFERENTLY KNEW AND I WAS AT ANY RATE SO AMUSING
4520-38484-0004 THAT FOR LONG AFTERWARDS HE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ME WITHOUT ASKING FOR NEWS OF THE OLD MAN OF THE SEA I HADN'T SAID MISTER SALTRAM WAS OLD AND IT WAS TO BE SEEN THAT HE WAS OF AN AGE TO OUTWEATHER GEORGE GRAVENER
4520-38484-0005 AND GRAVENER WAS STAYING AT HIS BROTHER'S EMPTY HOUSE IN EATON SQUARE AT CAMBRIDGE FIVE YEARS BEFORE EVEN IN OUR DEVASTATING SET HIS INTELLECTUAL POWER HAD SEEMED TO ME ALMOST AWFUL
4520-38484-0006 SOME ONE HAD ONCE ASKED ME PRIVATELY WITH BLANCHED CHEEKS WHAT IT WAS THEN THAT AFTER ALL SUCH A MIND AS THAT LEFT STANDING IT LEAVES ITSELF I COULD RECOLLECT DEVOUTLY REPLYING
4520-38484-0007 I COULD SMILE AT PRESENT FOR THIS REMEMBRANCE
4520-38484-0008 WITH THE FACT THAT SAVE IN THE SENSE OF BEING WELL SET UP ON HIS LEGS GEORGE GRAVENER HAD ACTUALLY CEASED TO TOWER THE UNIVERSE HE LAID LOW HAD SOMEHOW BLOOMED AGAIN THE USUAL EMINENCES WERE VISIBLE
4520-38484-0009 I WONDERED WHETHER HE HAD LOST HIS HUMOUR OR ONLY DREADFUL THOUGHT HAD NEVER HAD ANY NOT EVEN WHEN I HAD FANCIED HIM MOST ARISTOPHANESQUE WHAT WAS THE NEED OF APPEALING TO LAUGHTER HOWEVER
4520-38484-0010 I COULD ENVIOUSLY ENQUIRE WHERE YOU MIGHT APPEAL SO CONFIDENTLY TO MEASUREMENT MISTER SALTRAM'S QUEER FIGURE HIS THICK NOSE AND HANGING LIP WERE FRESH TO ME IN THE LIGHT OF MY OLD FRIEND'S FINE COLD SYMMETRY
4520-38484-0011 THEY PRESENTED MERE SUCCESS IN AMUSING AS THE REFUGE OF CONSCIOUS UGLINESS ALREADY AT HUNGRY TWENTY SIX GRAVENER LOOKED AS BLANK AND PARLIAMENTARY AS IF HE WERE FIFTY AND POPULAR
4520-38484-0012 IN MY SCRAP OF A RESIDENCE HE HAD A WORLDLING'S EYE FOR ITS FUTILE CONVENIENCES BUT NEVER A COMRADE'S JOKE I SOUNDED FRANK SALTRAM IN HIS EARS A CIRCUMSTANCE I MENTION IN ORDER TO NOTE THAT EVEN THEN
4520-38484-0013 I WAS SURPRISED AT HIS IMPATIENCE OF MY ENLIVENMENT AS HE HAD NEVER BEFORE HEARD OF THE PERSONAGE IT TOOK INDEED THE FORM OF IMPATIENCE OF THE PREPOSTEROUS MULVILLES HIS RELATION TO WHOM LIKE MINE
4520-38484-0014 HAD HAD ITS ORIGIN IN AN EARLY A CHILDISH INTIMACY WITH THE YOUNG ADELAIDE THE FRUIT OF MULTIPLIED TIES IN THE PREVIOUS GENERATION
4520-38484-0015 I GAINED A FRIEND BUT GRAVENER PRACTICALLY LOST ONE WE REACTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS FROM THE FORM TAKEN BY WHAT HE CALLED THEIR DEPLORABLE SOCIAL ACTION THE FORM THE TERM WAS ALSO HIS OF NASTY SECOND RATE
4520-38484-0016 GUSH I MAY HAVE HELD IN MY FOR INTERIEUR THAT THE GOOD PEOPLE AT WIMBLEDON WERE BEAUTIFUL FOOLS BUT WHEN HE SNIFFED AT THEM I COULDN'T HELP TAKING THE OPPOSITE LINE
4520-38484-0017 FOR I ALREADY FELT THAT EVEN SHOULD WE HAPPEN TO AGREE IT WOULD ALWAYS BE FOR REASONS THAT DIFFERED IT CAME HOME TO ME THAT HE WAS ADMIRABLY BRITISH AS WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A SOCIABLE SNEER AT MY BOOKBINDER
4520-38484-0018 HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE SERRIED ROWS OF MY LITTLE FRENCH LIBRARY OF COURSE I'VE NEVER SEEN THE FELLOW BUT IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH HE'S A HUMBUG CLEAR ENOUGH IS JUST WHAT IT ISN'T I REPLIED IF IT ONLY WERE
4520-38484-0019 A LONG ACHE FOR FINAL FRIVOLOUS REST GRAVENER WAS PROFOUND ENOUGH TO REMARK AFTER A MOMENT THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE HE COULDN'T BE ANYTHING BUT A DISSENTER AND WHEN I ANSWERED THAT THE VERY NOTE OF HIS FASCINATION
4520-38484-0020 WAS HIS EXTRAORDINARY SPECULATIVE BREADTH MY FRIEND RETORTED THAT THERE WAS NO CAD LIKE YOUR CULTIVATED CAD AND THAT I MIGHT DEPEND UPON DISCOVERING SINCE I HAD HAD THE LEVITY NOT ALREADY TO HAVE ENQUIRED
4520-38484-0021 THAT MY SHINING LIGHT PROCEEDED A GENERATION BACK FROM A METHODIST CHEESEMONGER I CONFESS I WAS STRUCK WITH HIS INSISTENCE AND I SAID AFTER REFLEXION
4520-38484-0022 ASKING THE QUESTION MAINLY TO LAY HIM THE TRAP OF SAYING THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THE POOR MAN DIDN'T DRESS FOR DINNER HE TOOK AN INSTANT TO CIRCUMVENT MY TRAP AND COME BLANDLY OUT THE OTHER SIDE
4520-38484-0023 IF I DIDN'T REFLECT THAT THEY DON'T RAVE ABOUT ME DON'T BE TOO SURE I'LL GRANT THAT HE'S A GENTLEMAN GRAVENER PRESENTLY ADDED IF YOU'LL ADMIT THAT HE'S A SCAMP
4520-38484-0024 MY FRIEND COLOURED AT THIS BUT HE DIDN'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT WHERE DID THEY PICK HIM UP I THINK THEY WERE STRUCK WITH SOMETHING HE HAD PUBLISHED I CAN FANCY THE DREARY THING I BELIEVE THEY FOUND OUT HE HAD ALL SORTS OF WORRIES AND DIFFICULTIES
4520-38484-0025 THAT OF COURSE WASN'T TO BE ENDURED SO THEY JUMPED AT THE PRIVILEGE OF PAYING HIS DEBTS I PROFESSED THAT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIS DEBTS AND I REMINDED MY VISITOR THAT THOUGH THE DEAR MULVILLES WERE ANGELS THEY WERE NEITHER IDIOTS NOR MILLIONAIRES
4520-38484-0026 WHAT THEY MAINLY AIMED AT WAS REUNITING MISTER SALTRAM TO HIS WIFE I WAS EXPECTING TO HEAR HE HAS BASELY ABANDONED HER GRAVENER WENT ON AT THIS
4520-38484-0027 I TRIED TO RECALL EXACTLY WHAT MISSUS MULVILLE HAD TOLD ME
4520-38484-0028 IT'S SHE WHO HAS LEFT HIM
4520-38484-0029 I CAN'T NO I REALLY CAN'T RESIST THE IMPRESSION THAT HE'S A BIG MAN I WAS ALREADY MASTERING TO MY SHAME PERHAPS BE IT SAID JUST THE TONE MY OLD FRIEND LEAST LIKED IT'S DOUBTLESS ONLY A TRIFLE
4520-38484-0030 WHY ON WHAT I BEGAN BY BORING YOU WITH HIS EXTRAORDINARY MIND
4520-38484-0031 POSSIBLY IN HIS WRITINGS BUT CERTAINLY IN HIS TALK WHICH IS FAR AND AWAY THE RICHEST I EVER LISTENED TO AND WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT MY DEAR FELLOW DON'T ASK ME ABOUT EVERYTHING I PURSUED
4520-38484-0032 REMINDING MYSELF OF POOR ADELAIDE ABOUT HIS IDEAS OF THINGS I THEN MORE CHARITABLY ADDED YOU MUST HAVE HEARD HIM TO KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT EVER WAS HEARD I COLOURED I ADMIT I OVERCHARGED A LITTLE
4520-38484-0033 FOR SUCH A PICTURE WAS AN ANTICIPATION OF SALTRAM'S LATER DEVELOPMENT AND STILL MORE OF MY FULLER ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM HOWEVER I REALLY EXPRESSED A LITTLE LYRICALLY PERHAPS MY ACTUAL IMAGINATION OF HIM
4520-38484-0034 WHEN I PROCEEDED TO DECLARE THAT IN A CLOUD OF TRADITION OF LEGEND HE MIGHT VERY WELL GO DOWN TO POSTERITY AS THE GREATEST OF ALL GREAT TALKERS BEFORE WE PARTED
4520-38484-0035 GEORGE GRAVENER HAD WONDERED WHY SUCH A ROW SHOULD BE MADE ABOUT A CHATTERBOX THE MORE AND WHY HE SHOULD BE PAMPERED AND PENSIONED THE GREATER THE WIND BAG THE GREATER THE CALAMITY OUT OF PROPORTION TO EVERYTHING ELSE ON EARTH
4520-38484-0036 HAD COME TO BE THIS WAGGING OF THE TONGUE WE WERE DRENCHED WITH TALK OUR WRETCHED AGE WAS DYING OF IT I DIFFERED FROM HIM HERE SINCERELY ONLY GOING SO FAR AS TO CONCEDE AND GLADLY THAT WE WERE DRENCHED WITH SOUND
4520-38484-0037 IT WAS NOT HOWEVER THE MERE SPEAKERS WHO WERE KILLING US IT WAS THE MERE STAMMERERS FINE TALK WAS AS RARE AS IT WAS REFRESHING THE GIFT OF THE GODS THEMSELVES
4520-38484-0038 THE ONE STARRY SPANGLE ON THE RAGGED CLOAK OF HUMANITY HOW MANY MEN WERE THERE WHO ROSE TO THIS PRIVILEGE OF HOW MANY MASTERS OF CONVERSATION COULD HE BOAST THE ACQUAINTANCE DYING OF TALK
4520-38484-0039 WHY WE WERE DYING OF THE LACK OF IT BAD WRITING WASN'T TALK AS MANY PEOPLE SEEMED TO THINK AND EVEN GOOD WASN'T ALWAYS TO BE COMPARED TO IT FROM THE BEST TALK INDEED THE BEST WRITING HAD SOMETHING TO LEARN
4520-38484-0040 SHOULD BE POINTED AT FOR HAVING LISTENED FOR HAVING ACTUALLY HEARD GRAVENER WHO HAD GLANCED AT HIS WATCH AND DISCOVERED IT WAS MIDNIGHT FOUND TO ALL THIS A RETORT BEAUTIFULLY CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM
4520-38484-0041 THERE'S ONE LITTLE FACT TO BE BORNE IN MIND IN THE PRESENCE EQUALLY OF THE BEST TALK AND OF THE WORST HE LOOKED IN SAYING THIS AS IF HE MEANT GREAT THINGS AND I WAS SURE HE COULD ONLY MEAN ONCE MORE
4520-38484-0042 THAT NEITHER OF THEM MATTERED IF A MAN WASN'T A REAL GENTLEMAN PERHAPS IT WAS WHAT HE DID MEAN HE DEPRIVED ME HOWEVER OF THE EXULTATION OF BEING RIGHT BY PUTTING THE TRUTH IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
4520-38484-0043 THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY COUNTS FOR ONE'S ESTIMATE OF A PERSON IS HIS CONDUCT HE HAD HIS WATCH STILL IN HIS PALM AND I REPROACHED HIM WITH UNFAIR PLAY IN HAVING ASCERTAINED BEFOREHAND THAT IT WAS NOW THE HOUR
4520-38484-0044 AT WHICH I ALWAYS GAVE IN MY PLEASANTRY SO FAR FAILED TO MOLLIFY HIM THAT HE PROMPTLY ADDED THAT TO THE RULE HE HAD JUST ENUNCIATED THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTION NONE WHATEVER NONE WHATEVER
