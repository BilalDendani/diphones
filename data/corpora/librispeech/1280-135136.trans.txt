1280-135136-0000 THE SECOND AND THIRD YEARS OF WHICH PERIOD EIGHTEEN O SIX AND EIGHTEEN O SEVEN WERE COMPARATIVELY STERILE BUT THE REST FROM EIGHTEEN O FIVE TO EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN INCLUSIVELY FURNISHED A LONG SUCCESSION OF VICTORIES
1280-135136-0001 THE LEAST OF WHICH IN A CONTEST OF THAT PORTENTOUS NATURE HAD AN INAPPRECIABLE VALUE OF POSITION PARTLY FOR ITS ABSOLUTE INTERFERENCE WITH THE PLANS OF OUR ENEMY
1280-135136-0002 BUT STILL MORE FROM ITS KEEPING ALIVE IN CENTRAL EUROPE THE SENSE OF A DEEP SEATED VULNERABILITY IN FRANCE EVEN TO TEASE THE COASTS OF OUR ENEMY TO MORTIFY THEM BY CONTINUAL BLOCKADES
1280-135136-0003 TO INSULT THEM BY CAPTURING IF IT WERE BUT A BAUBLING SCHOONER UNDER THE EYES OF THEIR ARROGANT ARMIES REPEATED FROM TIME TO TIME A SULLEN PROCLAMATION OF POWER LODGED IN A QUARTER TO WHICH THE HOPES OF CHRISTENDOM TURNED IN SECRET
1280-135136-0004 AND HAVING BEATEN THEM IN PITCHED BATTLES
1280-135136-0005 FIVE YEARS OF LIFE IT WAS WORTH PAYING DOWN FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF AN OUTSIDE PLACE ON A MAIL COACH WHEN CARRYING DOWN THE FIRST TIDINGS OF ANY SUCH EVENT AND IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT
1280-135136-0006 FROM OUR INSULAR SITUATION AND THE MULTITUDE OF OUR FRIGATES DISPOSABLE FOR THE RAPID TRANSMISSION OF INTELLIGENCE
1280-135136-0007 THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL NEWS WAS GENERALLY THE FIRST NEWS FROM EIGHT P M TO FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES LATER IMAGINE THE MAILS ASSEMBLED ON PARADE IN LOMBARD STREET WHERE AT THAT TIME WAS SEATED THE GENERAL POST OFFICE
1280-135136-0008 IN WHAT EXACT STRENGTH WE MUSTERED I DO NOT REMEMBER BUT FROM THE LENGTH OF EACH SEPARATE ATTELAGE WE FILLED THE STREET THOUGH A LONG ONE AND THOUGH WE WERE DRAWN UP IN DOUBLE FILE ON ANY NIGHT THE SPECTACLE WAS BEAUTIFUL
1280-135136-0009 THE ABSOLUTE PERFECTION OF ALL THE APPOINTMENTS ABOUT THE CARRIAGES AND THE HARNESS AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE HORSES WERE WHAT MIGHT FIRST HAVE FIXED THE ATTENTION EVERY CARRIAGE ON EVERY MORNING IN THE YEAR WAS TAKEN DOWN TO AN INSPECTOR FOR EXAMINATION
1280-135136-0010 EVERY PART OF EVERY CARRIAGE HAD BEEN CLEANED EVERY HORSE HAD BEEN GROOMED WITH AS MUCH RIGOR AS IF THEY BELONGED TO A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN AND THAT PART OF THE SPECTACLE OFFERED ITSELF ALWAYS
1280-135136-0011 BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE US IS A NIGHT OF VICTORY AND BEHOLD TO THE ORDINARY DISPLAY WHAT A HEART SHAKING ADDITION HORSES MEN CARRIAGES ALL ARE DRESSED IN LAURELS AND FLOWERS OAK LEAVES AND RIBBONS THE GUARDS
1280-135136-0012 WHO ARE HIS MAJESTY'S SERVANTS AND THE COACHMEN WHO ARE WITHIN THE PRIVILEGE OF THE POST OFFICE WEAR THE ROYAL LIVERIES OF COURSE AND AS IT IS SUMMER FOR ALL THE LAND VICTORIES WERE WON IN SUMMER
1280-135136-0013 THEY WEAR ON THIS FINE EVENING THESE LIVERIES EXPOSED TO VIEW WITHOUT ANY COVERING OF UPPER COATS SUCH A COSTUME AND THE ELABORATE ARRANGEMENT OF THE LAURELS IN THEIR HATS DILATED THEIR HEARTS
1280-135136-0014 BY GIVING TO THEM OPENLY AN OFFICIAL CONNECTION WITH THE GREAT NEWS IN WHICH ALREADY THEY HAVE THE GENERAL INTEREST OF PATRIOTISM THAT GREAT NATIONAL SENTIMENT SURMOUNTS AND QUELLS ALL SENSE OF ORDINARY DISTINCTIONS
1280-135136-0015 THOSE PASSENGERS WHO HAPPEN TO BE GENTLEMEN ARE NOW HARDLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED AS SUCH EXCEPT BY DRESS THE USUAL RESERVE OF THEIR MANNER IN SPEAKING TO THE ATTENDANTS HAS ON THIS NIGHT MELTED AWAY
1280-135136-0016 ONE HEART ONE PRIDE ONE GLORY CONNECTS EVERY MAN BY THE TRANSCENDENT BOND OF HIS ENGLISH BLOOD THE SPECTATORS WHO ARE NUMEROUS BEYOND PRECEDENT EXPRESS THEIR SYMPATHY WITH THESE FERVENT FEELINGS BY CONTINUAL HURRAHS
1280-135136-0017 EVERY MOMENT ARE SHOUTED ALOUD BY THE POST OFFICE SERVANTS THE GREAT ANCESTRAL NAMES OF CITIES KNOWN TO HISTORY THROUGH A THOUSAND YEARS LINCOLN WINCHESTER PORTSMOUTH GLOUCESTER OXFORD BRISTOL
1280-135136-0018 MANCHESTER YORK NEWCASTLE EDINBURGH PERTH GLASGOW EXPRESSING THE GRANDEUR OF THE EMPIRE BY THE ANTIQUITY OF ITS TOWNS AND THE GRANDEUR OF THE MAIL ESTABLISHMENT BY THE DIFFUSIVE RADIATION OF ITS SEPARATE MISSIONS
1280-135136-0019 EVERY MOMENT YOU HEAR THE THUNDER OF LIDS LOCKED DOWN UPON THE MAIL BAGS THAT SOUND TO EACH INDIVIDUAL MAIL IS THE SIGNAL FOR DRAWING OFF WHICH PROCESS IS THE FINEST PART OF THE ENTIRE SPECTACLE
1280-135136-0020 THEN COME THE HORSES INTO PLAY HORSES CAN THESE BE HORSES THAT UNLESS POWERFULLY REINED IN WOULD BOUND OFF WITH THE ACTION AND GESTURES OF LEOPARDS WHAT STIR WHAT SEA LIKE FERMENT
1280-135136-0021 WHAT A THUNDERING OF WHEELS WHAT A TRAMPLING OF HORSES WHAT FAREWELL CHEERS WHAT REDOUBLING PEALS OF BROTHERLY CONGRATULATION CONNECTING THE NAME OF THE PARTICULAR MAIL LIVERPOOL FOR EVER WITH THE NAME OF THE PARTICULAR VICTORY
1280-135136-0022 BADAJOZ FOR EVER OR SALAMANCA FOR EVER THE HALF SLUMBERING CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ALL NIGHT LONG AND ALL THE NEXT DAY PERHAPS FOR EVEN A LONGER PERIOD MANY OF THESE MAILS LIKE FIRE RACING ALONG A TRAIN OF GUNPOWDER
1280-135136-0023 WILL BE KINDLING AT EVERY INSTANT NEW SUCCESSIONS OF BURNING JOY HAS AN OBSCURE EFFECT OF MULTIPLYING THE VICTORY ITSELF BY MULTIPLYING TO THE IMAGINATION INTO INFINITY THE STAGES OF ITS PROGRESSIVE DIFFUSION
1280-135136-0024 A FIERY ARROW SEEMS TO BE LET LOOSE
1280-135136-0025 NORTHWARDS FOR SIX HUNDRED AND THE SYMPATHY OF OUR LOMBARD STREET FRIENDS AT PARTING IS EXALTED A HUNDRED FOLD BY A SORT OF VISIONARY SYMPATHY WITH THE APPROACHING SYMPATHIES YET UNBORN WHICH WE ARE GOING TO EVOKE
1280-135136-0026 IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THE SUMMER EVENING THE SUN PERHAPS ONLY JUST AT THE POINT OF SETTING WE ARE SEEN FROM EVERY STORY OF EVERY HOUSE
1280-135136-0027 HEADS OF EVERY AGE CROWD TO THE WINDOWS YOUNG AND OLD UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF OUR VICTORIOUS SYMBOLS AND ROLLING VOLLEYS OF SYMPATHIZING CHEERS RUN ALONG BEHIND AND BEFORE OUR COURSE
1280-135136-0028 THE BEGGAR REARING HIMSELF AGAINST THE WALL FORGETS HIS LAMENESS REAL OR ASSUMED THINKS NOT OF HIS WHINING TRADE BUT STANDS ERECT WITH BOLD EXULTING SMILES AS WE PASS HIM THE VICTORY HAS HEALED HIM AND SAYS BE THOU WHOLE
1280-135136-0029 WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM GARRETS ALIKE AND CELLARS LOOK DOWN OR LOOK UP WITH LOVING EYES UPON OUR GAY RIBBONS AND OUR MARTIAL LAURELS SOMETIMES KISS THEIR HANDS SOMETIMES HANG OUT AS SIGNALS OF AFFECTION
1280-135136-0030 POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS APRONS DUSTERS ANYTHING THAT LIES READY TO THEIR HANDS ON THE LONDON SIDE OF BARNET TO WHICH WE DRAW NEAR WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTER NINE OBSERVE THAT PRIVATE CARRIAGE WHICH IS APPROACHING US
1280-135136-0031 THE WEATHER BEING SO WARM THE GLASSES ARE ALL DOWN AND ONE MAY READ AS ON THE STAGE OF A THEATRE EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON WITHIN THE CARRIAGE IT CONTAINS THREE LADIES ONE LIKELY TO BE MAMA AND TWO OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN
1280-135136-0032 WHO ARE PROBABLY HER DAUGHTERS WHAT LOVELY ANIMATION WHAT BEAUTIFUL UNPREMEDITATED PANTOMIME EXPLAINING TO US EVERY SYLLABLE THAT PASSES IN THESE INGENUOUS GIRLS BY THE SUDDEN START AND RAISING OF THE HANDS
1280-135136-0033 ON FIRST DISCOVERING OUR LAURELLED EQUIPAGE BY THE SUDDEN MOVEMENT AND APPEAL TO THE ELDER LADY FROM BOTH OF THEM AND BY THE HEIGHTENED COLOR ON THEIR ANIMATED COUNTENANCES WE CAN ALMOST HEAR THEM SAYING
1280-135136-0034 SEE SEE LOOK AT THEIR LAURELS OH MAMA THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT BATTLE IN SPAIN AND IT HAS BEEN A GREAT VICTORY IN A MOMENT WE ARE ON THE POINT OF PASSING THEM WE PASSENGERS I ON THE BOX AND THE TWO ON THE ROOF BEHIND ME RAISE OUR HATS
1280-135136-0035 THE COACHMAN MAKES HIS PROFESSIONAL SALUTE WITH THE WHIP THE GUARD EVEN THOUGH PUNCTILIOUS ON THE MATTER OF HIS DIGNITY AS AN OFFICER UNDER THE CROWN TOUCHES HIS HAT THE LADIES MOVE TO US IN RETURN WITH A WINNING GRACIOUSNESS OF GESTURE
1280-135136-0036 ALL SMILE ON EACH SIDE IN A WAY THAT NOBODY COULD MISUNDERSTAND AND THAT NOTHING SHORT OF A GRAND NATIONAL SYMPATHY COULD SO INSTANTANEOUSLY PROMPT WILL THESE LADIES SAY THAT WE ARE NOTHING TO THEM
1280-135136-0037 OH NO THEY WILL NOT SAY THAT THEY CANNOT DENY THEY DO NOT DENY THAT FOR THIS NIGHT THEY ARE OUR SISTERS GENTLE OR SIMPLE SCHOLAR OR ILLITERATE SERVANT FOR TWELVE HOURS TO COME WE ON THE OUTSIDE HAVE THE HONOR TO BE THEIR BROTHERS
1280-135136-0038 THOSE POOR WOMEN AGAIN WHO STOP TO GAZE UPON US WITH DELIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE OF BARNET AND SEEM BY THEIR AIR OF WEARINESS TO BE RETURNING FROM LABOR DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY ARE WASHERWOMEN AND CHAR WOMEN
1280-135136-0039 OH MY POOR FRIEND YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN THEY ARE NOTHING OF THE KIND I ASSURE YOU THEY STAND IN A HIGHER RANK FOR THIS ONE NIGHT THEY FEEL THEMSELVES BY BIRTHRIGHT TO BE DAUGHTERS OF ENGLAND AND ANSWER TO NO HUMBLER TITLE
1280-135136-0040 EVERY JOY HOWEVER EVEN RAPTUROUS JOY SUCH IS THE SAD LAW OF EARTH MAY CARRY WITH IT GRIEF OR FEAR OF GRIEF TO SOME
1280-135136-0041 THREE MILES BEYOND BARNET WE SEE APPROACHING US ANOTHER PRIVATE CARRIAGE NEARLY REPEATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FORMER CASE HERE ALSO THE GLASSES ARE ALL DOWN HERE ALSO IS AN ELDERLY LADY SEATED
1280-135136-0042 BUT THE TWO AMIABLE DAUGHTERS ARE MISSING FOR THE SINGLE YOUNG PERSON SITTING BY THE LADY'S SIDE SEEMS TO BE AN ATTENDANT SO I JUDGE FROM HER DRESS AND HER AIR OF RESPECTFUL RESERVE THE LADY IS IN MOURNING
1280-135136-0043 AND HER COUNTENANCE EXPRESSES SORROW AT FIRST SHE DOES NOT LOOK UP SO THAT I BELIEVE SHE IS NOT AWARE OF OUR APPROACH UNTIL SHE HEARS THE MEASURED BEATING OF OUR HORSES HOOFS THEN SHE RAISES HER EYES TO SETTLE THEM PAINFULLY ON OUR TRIUMPHAL EQUIPAGE
1280-135136-0044 OUR DECORATIONS EXPLAIN THE CASE TO HER AT ONCE BUT SHE BEHOLDS THEM WITH APPARENT ANXIETY OR EVEN WITH TERROR
1280-135136-0045 SOME TIME BEFORE THIS I FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO HIT A FLYING MARK WHEN EMBARRASSED BY THE COACHMAN'S PERSON AND REINS INTERVENING HAD GIVEN TO THE GUARD A COURIER EVENING PAPER CONTAINING THE GAZETTE FOR THE NEXT CARRIAGE THAT MIGHT PASS
1280-135136-0046 GLORIOUS VICTORY MIGHT CATCH THE EYE AT ONCE TO SEE THE PAPER HOWEVER AT ALL INTERPRETED AS IT WAS BY OUR ENSIGNS OF TRIUMPH EXPLAINED EVERYTHING AND IF THE GUARD WERE RIGHT IN THINKING THE LADY TO HAVE RECEIVED IT WITH A GESTURE OF HORROR
1280-135136-0047 IT COULD NOT BE DOUBTFUL THAT SHE HAD SUFFERED SOME DEEP PERSONAL AFFLICTION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SPANISH WAR
1280-135136-0048 HERE NOW WAS THE CASE OF ONE WHO HAVING FORMERLY SUFFERED MIGHT ERRONEOUSLY PERHAPS BE DISTRESSING HERSELF WITH ANTICIPATIONS OF ANOTHER SIMILAR SUFFERING THAT SAME NIGHT AND HARDLY THREE HOURS LATER OCCURRED THE REVERSE CASE
1280-135136-0049 A POOR WOMAN WHO TOO PROBABLY WOULD FIND HERSELF IN A DAY OR TWO TO HAVE SUFFERED THE HEAVIEST OF AFFLICTIONS BY THE BATTLE BLINDLY ALLOWED HERSELF TO EXPRESS AN EXULTATION SO UNMEASURED IN THE NEWS AND ITS DETAILS
1280-135136-0050 THIS WAS AT SOME LITTLE TOWN I FORGET WHAT WHERE WE HAPPENED TO CHANGE HORSES NEAR MIDNIGHT
1280-135136-0051 WE SAW MANY LIGHTS MOVING ABOUT AS WE DREW NEAR AND PERHAPS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SCENE ON OUR ROUTE WAS OUR RECEPTION AT THIS PLACE THE FLASHING OF TORCHES AND THE BEAUTIFUL RADIANCE OF BLUE LIGHTS TECHNICALLY BENGAL LIGHTS UPON THE HEADS OF OUR HORSES
1280-135136-0052 THE FINE EFFECT OF SUCH A SHOWERY AND GHOSTLY ILLUMINATION FALLING UPON FLOWERS AND GLITTERING LAURELS WHILST ALL AROUND THE MASSY DARKNESS SEEMED TO INVEST US WITH WALLS OF IMPENETRABLE BLACKNESS TOGETHER WITH THE PRODIGIOUS ENTHUSIASM OF THE PEOPLE
1280-135136-0053 COMPOSED A PICTURE AT ONCE SCENICAL AND AFFECTING AS WE STAID FOR THREE OR FOUR MINUTES I ALIGHTED AND IMMEDIATELY FROM A DISMANTLED STALL IN THE STREET WHERE PERHAPS SHE HAD BEEN PRESIDING AT SOME PART OF THE EVENING
1280-135136-0054 ADVANCED EAGERLY A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN THE SIGHT OF MY NEWSPAPER IT WAS THAT HAD DRAWN HER ATTENTION UPON MYSELF THE VICTORY WHICH WE WERE CARRYING DOWN TO THE PROVINCES ON THIS OCCASION WAS THE IMPERFECT ONE OF TALAVERA
1280-135136-0055 I TOLD HER THE MAIN OUTLINE OF THE BATTLE BUT HER AGITATION THOUGH NOT THE AGITATION OF FEAR BUT OF EXULTATION RATHER AND ENTHUSIASM HAD BEEN SO CONSPICUOUS WHEN LISTENING AND WHEN FIRST APPLYING FOR INFORMATION
1280-135136-0056 THAT I COULD NOT BUT ASK HER IF SHE HAD NOT SOME RELATION IN THE PENINSULAR ARMY OH YES HER ONLY SON WAS THERE IN WHAT REGIMENT
1280-135136-0057 MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME AS SHE MADE THAT ANSWER THIS SUBLIME REGIMENT WHICH AN ENGLISHMAN SHOULD NEVER MENTION WITHOUT RAISING HIS HAT TO THEIR MEMORY
1280-135136-0058 THEY LEAPED THEIR HORSES OVER A TRENCH WHERE THEY COULD INTO IT AND WITH THE RESULT OF DEATH OR MUTILATION WHEN THEY COULD NOT WHAT PROPORTION CLEARED THE TRENCH IS NOWHERE STATED
1280-135136-0059 THOSE WHO DID CLOSED UP AND WENT DOWN UPON THE ENEMY WITH SUCH DIVINITY OF FERVOR I USE THE WORD DIVINITY BY DESIGN THE INSPIRATION OF GOD MUST HAVE PROMPTED THIS MOVEMENT TO THOSE WHOM EVEN THEN HE WAS CALLING TO HIS PRESENCE THAT TWO RESULTS FOLLOWED
1280-135136-0060 PARALYZED A FRENCH COLUMN SIX THOUSAND STRONG THEN ASCENDING THE HILL AND FIXED THE GAZE OF THE WHOLE FRENCH ARMY AS REGARDED THEMSELVES
1280-135136-0061 BUT EVENTUALLY I BELIEVE NOT SO MANY AS ONE IN FOUR SURVIVED AND THIS THEN WAS THE REGIMENT A REGIMENT ALREADY FOR SOME HOURS KNOWN TO MYSELF AND ALL LONDON AS STRETCHED BY A LARGE MAJORITY UPON ONE BLOODY ACELDAMA
1280-135136-0062 IN WHICH THE YOUNG TROOPER SERVED WHOSE MOTHER WAS NOW TALKING WITH MYSELF IN A SPIRIT OF SUCH HOPEFUL ENTHUSIASM DID I TELL HER THE TRUTH HAD I THE HEART TO BREAK UP HER DREAMS NO
1280-135136-0063 I SAID TO MYSELF TO MORROW OR THE NEXT DAY SHE WILL HEAR THE WORST FOR THIS NIGHT WHEREFORE SHOULD SHE NOT SLEEP IN PEACE AFTER TO MORROW THE CHANCES ARE TOO MANY THAT PEACE WILL FORSAKE HER PILLOW
1280-135136-0064 BUT IF I TOLD HER NOT OF THE BLOODY PRICE THAT HAD BEEN PAID THERE WAS NO REASON FOR SUPPRESSING THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM HER SON'S REGIMENT TO THE SERVICE AND GLORY OF THE DAY
1280-135136-0065 FOR THE VERY FEW WORDS THAT I HAD TIME FOR SPEAKING I GOVERNED MYSELF ACCORDINGLY I SHOWED HER NOT THE FUNERAL BANNERS UNDER WHICH THE NOBLE REGIMENT WAS SLEEPING
1280-135136-0066 I LIFTED NOT THE OVERSHADOWING LAURELS FROM THE BLOODY TRENCH IN WHICH HORSE AND RIDER LAY MANGLED TOGETHER BUT I TOLD HER HOW THESE DEAR CHILDREN OF ENGLAND PRIVATES AND OFFICERS
1280-135136-0067 HAD LEAPED THEIR HORSES OVER ALL OBSTACLES AS GAILY AS HUNTERS TO THE MORNING'S CHASE I TOLD HER HOW THEY RODE THEIR HORSES INTO THE MISTS OF DEATH SAYING TO MYSELF BUT NOT SAYING TO HER
1280-135136-0068 POURED OUT THEIR NOBLE BLOOD AS CHEERFULLY AS EVER AFTER A LONG DAY'S SPORT WHEN INFANTS THEY HAD RESTED THEIR WEARIED HEADS UPON THEIR MOTHER'S KNEES OR HAD SUNK TO SLEEP IN HER ARMS
