8222-274379-0000 THE EARL OF MANCHESTER PROVOKED AT THE IMPEACHMENT WHICH THE KING HAD LODGED AGAINST HIM HAD LONG FORWARDED THE WAR WITH ALACRITY BUT BEING A MAN OF HUMANITY AND GOOD PRINCIPLES THE VIEW OF PUBLIC CALAMITIES AND THE PROSPECT OF A TOTAL SUBVERSION OF GOVERNMENT
8222-274379-0001 THAT THIS NOBLEMAN HAD WILFULLY NEGLECTED AT DENNINGTON CASTLE A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY OF FINISHING THE WAR BY A TOTAL DEFEAT OF THE ROYALISTS I SHOWED HIM EVIDENTLY SAID CROMWELL HOW THIS SUCCESS MIGHT BE OBTAINED
8222-274379-0002 AND ONLY DESIRED LEAVE WITH MY OWN BRIGADE OF HORSE TO CHARGE THE KING'S ARMY IN THEIR RETREAT LEAVING IT IN THE EARL'S CHOICE IF HE THOUGHT PROPER
8222-274379-0003 SO FULL WAS CROMWELL OF THESE REPUBLICAN PROJECTS THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS HABITS OF PROFOUND DISSIMULATION HE COULD NOT SO CAREFULLY GUARD HIS EXPRESSIONS BUT THAT SOMETIMES HIS FAVORITE NOTIONS WOULD ESCAPE HIM
8222-274379-0004 IT WAS IN SOME MEASURE OWING TO HIS POPULARITY THAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN ENABLED TO LEVY AN ARMY OR MAKE HEAD AGAINST THE ROYAL CAUSE MANCHESTER WARWICK AND THE OTHER COMMANDERS
8222-274379-0005 TOOK CARE TO TREAT OF THE REIGNING DIVISIONS IN THE PARLIAMENT AND ASCRIBED THEM ENTIRELY TO THE SELFISH ENDS PURSUED BY THE MEMBERS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE MEMBERS THEY SAID ARE LODGED ALL THE CONSIDERABLE COMMANDS OF THE ARMY
8222-274379-0006 ALL THE LUCRATIVE OFFICES IN THE CIVIL ADMINISTRATION AND WHILE THE NATION IS FALLING EVERY DAY INTO POVERTY AND GROANS UNDER AN INSUPPORTABLE LOAD OF TAXES THESE MEN MULTIPLY POSSESSION ON POSSESSION AND WILL IN A LITTLE TIME BE MASTERS OF ALL THE WEALTH OF THE KINGDOM
8222-274379-0007 AND OPERATIONS IN THE FIELD CONCURRING IN THE SAME PERNICIOUS END WITH DELIBERATIONS IN THE CABINET
8222-274379-0008 SIR HENRY VANE TOLD THE COMMONS THAT IF EVER GOD APPEARED TO THEM IT WAS IN THE ORDINANCES OF YESTERDAY THAT AS HE WAS CREDIBLY INFORMED BY MANY WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT IN DIFFERENT CONGREGATIONS THE SAME LAMENTATIONS AND DISCOURSES WHICH THE GODLY PREACHERS HAD MADE BEFORE THEM
8222-274379-0009 HAD BEEN HEARD IN OTHER CHURCHES THAT SO REMARKABLE A CONCURRENCE COULD PROCEED ONLY FROM THE IMMEDIATE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT HE THEREFORE ENTREATED THEM IN VINDICATION OF THEIR OWN HONOR IN CONSIDERATION OF THEIR DUTY TO GOD AND THEIR COUNTRY
8222-274379-0010 TO LAY ASIDE ALL PRIVATE ENDS AND RENOUNCE EVERY OFFICE ATTENDED WITH PROFIT OR ADVANTAGE THAT THE ABSENCE OF SO MANY MEMBERS OCCUPIED IN DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS HAD RENDERED THE HOUSE EXTREMELY THIN AND DIMINISHED THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR DETERMINATIONS
8222-274379-0011 AND THAT HE COULD NOT FORBEAR FOR HIS OWN PART ACCUSING HIMSELF AS ONE WHO ENJOYED A GAINFUL OFFICE THAT OF TREASURER OF THE NAVY AND THOUGH HE WAS POSSESSED OF IT BEFORE THE CIVIL COMMOTIONS AND OWED IT NOT TO THE FAVOR OF THE PARLIAMENT
8222-274379-0012 NOTHING WHICH THEY UNDERTOOK COULD POSSIBLY PROSPER THE PARLIAMENT NO DOUBT CONTINUED HE
8222-274379-0013 HAD DONE WISELY ON THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR IN ENGAGING SEVERAL OF ITS MEMBERS IN THE MOST DANGEROUS PARTS OF IT AND THEREBY SATISFYING THE NATION THAT THEY INTENDED TO SHARE ALL HAZARDS WITH THE MEANEST OF THE PEOPLE BUT AFFAIRS ARE NOW CHANGED DURING THE PROGRESS OF MILITARY OPERATIONS
8222-274379-0014 YET HE COULD ASSURE THEM THAT THEIR TROOPS CONTAINED GENERALS FIT TO COMMAND IN ANY ENTERPRISE IN CHRISTENDOM THE ARMY INDEED HE WAS SORRY TO SAY IT DID NOT CORRESPOND BY ITS DISCIPLINE TO THE MERIT OF THE OFFICERS NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES
8222-274379-0015 MANY OF THE PRESBYTERIANS SHOWED THE INCONVENIENCE AND DANGER OF THE PROJECTED ALTERATION WHITLOCKE IN PARTICULAR A MAN OF HONOR WHO LOVED HIS COUNTRY THOUGH IN EVERY CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT HE ALWAYS ADHERED TO THE RULING POWER SAID
8222-274379-0016 THAT BESIDES THE INGRATITUDE OF DISCARDING AND THAT BY FRAUD AND ARTIFICE SO MANY NOBLE PERSONS TO WHOM THE PARLIAMENT HAD HITHERTO OWED ITS CHIEF SUPPORT
8222-274379-0017 THEY WOULD FIND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF MEN NOW FORMED BY EXPERIENCE TO COMMAND AND AUTHORITY THAT THE RANK ALONE POSSESSED BY SUCH AS WERE MEMBERS OF EITHER HOUSE PREVENTED ENVY RETAINED THE ARMY IN OBEDIENCE AND GAVE WEIGHT TO MILITARY ORDERS
8222-274379-0018 THAT THE GREEKS AND ROMANS THE WISEST AND MOST PASSIONATE LOVERS OF LIBERTY HAD EVER INTRUSTED TO THEIR SENATORS THE COMMAND OF ARMIES
8222-274379-0019 AND FOR A LONG TIME RENT THE PARLIAMENT AND CITY INTO FACTIONS BUT AT LAST BY THE PREVALENCE OF ENVY WITH SOME WITH OTHERS OF FALSE MODESTY WITH A GREAT MANY OF THE REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT VIEWS IT PASSED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND WAS SENT TO THE UPPER HOUSE
8222-274379-0020 THE PEERS THOUGH THE SCHEME WAS IN PART LEVELLED AGAINST THEIR ORDER THOUGH ALL OF THEM WERE AT BOTTOM EXTREMELY AVERSE TO IT THOUGH THEY EVEN VENTURED ONCE TO REJECT IT YET POSSESSED SO LITTLE AUTHORITY THAT THEY DURST NOT PERSEVERE IN OPPOSING THE RESOLUTION OF THE COMMONS
8222-274379-0021 AND THEY THOUGHT IT BETTER POLICY BY AN UNLIMITED COMPLIANCE TO WARD OFF THAT RUIN WHICH THEY SAW APPROACHING THE ORDINANCE THEREFORE HAVING PASSED BOTH HOUSES
8222-274379-0022 BRERETON AND MANY OTHERS RESIGNED THEIR COMMANDS AND RECEIVED THE THANKS OF PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR GOOD SERVICES
8222-274379-0023 IT IS REMARKABLE THAT HIS COMMISSION DID NOT RUN LIKE THAT OF ESSEX IN THE NAME OF THE KING AND PARLIAMENT BUT IN THAT OF THE PARLIAMENT ALONE AND THE ARTICLE CONCERNING THE SAFETY OF THE KING'S PERSON WAS OMITTED SO MUCH HAD ANIMOSITIES INCREASED BETWEEN THE PARTIES
8222-274379-0024 AT THE TIME WHEN THE OTHER OFFICERS RESIGNED THEIR COMMISSIONS CARE WAS TAKEN THAT HE SHOULD BE SENT WITH A BODY OF HORSE TO RELIEVE TAUNTON BESIEGED BY THE ROYALISTS HIS ABSENCE BEING REMARKED ORDERS WERE DESPATCHED FOR HIS IMMEDIATE ATTENDANCE IN PARLIAMENT
8222-274379-0025 WROTE TO THE PARLIAMENT AND DESIRED LEAVE TO RETAIN FOR SOME DAYS LIEUTENANT GENERAL CROMWELL WHOSE ADVICE HE SAID WOULD BE USEFUL IN SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF THOSE OFFICERS WHO HAD RESIGNED SHORTLY AFTER HE BEGGED WITH MUCH EARNESTNESS
8222-274379-0026 OR PRINCIPLES DERIVED FROM RELIGIOUS AND PARTY ZEAL HE SEEMS NEVER IN THE COURSE OF HIS PUBLIC CONDUCT TO HAVE BEEN DIVERTED BY PRIVATE INTEREST OR AMBITION FROM ADHERING STRICTLY TO THESE PRINCIPLES SINCERE IN HIS PROFESSIONS
8222-274379-0027 DISINTERESTED IN HIS VIEWS OPEN IN HIS CONDUCT HE HAD FORMED ONE OF THE MOST SHINING CHARACTERS OF THE AGE
8222-274379-0028 AND HIS EMBARRASSED AND CONFUSED ELOCUTION ON EVERY OCCASION BUT WHEN HE GAVE ORDERS DIMINISHED THE LUSTRE OF HIS MERIT AND RENDERED THE PART WHICH HE ACTED EVEN WHEN VESTED WITH THE SUPREME COMMAND BUT SECONDARY AND SUBORDINATE CROMWELL
8222-274379-0029 BY WHOSE SAGACITY AND INSINUATION FAIRFAX WAS ENTIRELY GOVERNED IS ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT AND MOST SINGULAR PERSONAGES THAT OCCURS IN HISTORY THE STROKES OF HIS CHARACTER ARE AS OPEN AND STRONGLY MARKED AS THE SCHEMES OF HIS CONDUCT WERE DURING THE TIME
8222-274379-0030 DARK AND IMPENETRABLE HIS EXTENSIVE CAPACITY ENABLED HIM TO FORM THE MOST ENLARGED PROJECTS HIS ENTERPRISING GENIUS WAS NOT DISMAYED WITH THE BOLDEST AND MOST DANGEROUS CARRIED BY HIS NATURAL TEMPER TO MAGNANIMITY TO GRANDEUR
8222-274379-0031 AND BY USING WELL THAT AUTHORITY WHICH HE HAD ATTAINED BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE HE HAS LESSENED IF NOT OVERPOWERED OUR DETESTATION OF HIS ENORMITIES BY OUR ADMIRATION OF HIS SUCCESS AND OF HIS GENIUS
8222-274379-0032 DURING THIS IMPORTANT TRANSACTION OF THE SELF DENYING ORDINANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE WERE LIKEWISE CARRIED ON THOUGH WITH SMALL HOPES OF SUCCESS THE KING HAVING SENT TWO MESSAGES
8222-274379-0033 IT NOW BECAME NECESSARY FOR HIM TO RETRACT HIS FORMER DECLARATION THAT THE TWO HOUSES AT WESTMINSTER WERE NOT A FREE PARLIAMENT AND ACCORDINGLY HE WAS INDUCED THOUGH WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE TO GIVE THEM IN HIS ANSWER THE APPELLATION OF THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND
8222-274379-0034 IS THE MOST NOTED OF THOSE VERY FEW INSTANCES FROM WHICH THE ENEMIES OF THIS PRINCE HAVE ENDEAVORED TO LOAD HIM WITH THE IMPUTATION OF INSINCERITY AND HAVE INFERRED THAT THE PARLIAMENT COULD REPOSE NO CONFIDENCE IN HIS PROFESSIONS AND DECLARATIONS NOT EVEN IN HIS LAWS AND STATUTES
