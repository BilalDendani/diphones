3546-9342-0000 AND THEN HER VOICE RESPONDING YES OH IT'S YOU INDEED I SHOULD OF COURSE THEN I'LL EXPECT YOU ABOUT THREE YES GOOD BYE TILL THEN
3546-9342-0001 A FEW MINUTES LATER HE HEARD HER SPEAKING TO SOMEONE BENEATH HIS WINDOW AND LOOKING OUT SAW HER DIRECTING THE REMOVAL OF PLANTS FROM A SMALL GARDEN BED TO THE MAJOR'S CONSERVATORY FOR THE WINTER THERE WAS AN AIR OF BRISKNESS ABOUT HER
3546-9342-0002 AS SHE TURNED AWAY TO GO INTO THE HOUSE SHE LAUGHED GAILY WITH THE MAJOR'S GARDENER OVER SOMETHING HE SAID AND THIS UNCONCERNED CHEERFULNESS OF HER WAS TERRIBLE TO HER SON HE WENT TO HIS DESK AND SEARCHING THE JUMBLED CONTENTS OF A DRAWER
3546-9342-0003 BROUGHT FORTH A LARGE UNFRAMED PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS FATHER UPON WHICH HE GAZED LONG AND PITEOUSLY TILL AT LAST HOT TEARS STOOD IN HIS EYES IT WAS STRANGE HOW THE INCONSEQUENT FACE OF WILBUR SEEMED TO INCREASE IN HIGH SIGNIFICANCE
3546-9342-0004 DURING THIS BELATED INTERVIEW BETWEEN FATHER AND SON AND HOW IT SEEMED TO TAKE ON A REPROACHFUL NOBILITY AND YET UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE NATURAL THAN THAT GEORGE HAVING PAID BUT THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO HIS FATHER IN LIFE
3546-9342-0005 SHOULD BEGIN TO DEIFY HIM NOW THAT HE WAS DEAD POOR POOR FATHER THE SON WHISPERED BROKENLY POOR MAN I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T KNOW HE WRAPPED THE PICTURE IN A SHEET OF NEWSPAPER PUT IT UNDER HIS ARM AND LEAVING THE HOUSE HURRIEDLY AND STEALTHILY
3546-9342-0006 THE ROOM MOST USED BY ISABEL AND FANNY AND HIMSELF THEN HE WENT TO A FRONT WINDOW OF THE LONG RECEPTION ROOM AND SAT LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE LACE CURTAINS THE HOUSE WAS QUIET THOUGH ONCE OR TWICE HE HEARD HIS MOTHER AND FANNY MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS
3546-9342-0007 AND A RIPPLE OF SONG IN THE VOICE OF ISABEL A FRAGMENT FROM THE ROMANTIC BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN LORD BATEMAN WAS A NOBLE LORD A NOBLE LORD OF HIGH DEGREE AND HE SAILED WEST AND HE SAILED EAST FAR COUNTRIES FOR TO SEE
3546-9342-0008 THE WORDS BECAME INDISTINCT THE AIR WAS HUMMED ABSENTLY THE HUMMING SHIFTED TO A WHISTLE THEN DRIFTED OUT OF HEARING AND THE PLACE WAS STILL AGAIN GEORGE LOOKED OFTEN AT HIS WATCH BUT HIS VIGIL DID NOT LAST AN HOUR
3546-9342-0009 AT TEN MINUTES OF THREE PEERING THROUGH THE CURTAIN HE SAW AN AUTOMOBILE STOP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND EUGENE MORGAN JUMP LIGHTLY DOWN FROM IT THE CAR WAS OF A NEW PATTERN LOW AND LONG WITH AN AMPLE SEAT IN THE TONNEAU FACING FORWARD AND A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER SAT AT THE WHEEL
3546-9342-0010 A STRANGE FIGURE IN LEATHER GOGGLED OUT OF ALL PERSONALITY AND SEEMINGLY PART OF THE MECHANISM EUGENE HIMSELF AS HE CAME UP THE CEMENT PATH TO THE HOUSE WAS A FIGURE OF THE NEW ERA WHICH WAS IN TIME TO BE SO DISASTROUS TO STIFF HATS AND SKIRTED COATS
3546-9342-0011 EUGENE THIS AFTERNOON WAS RICHLY IN THE NEW OUTDOOR MODE
3546-9342-0012 HIS CAP AND GLOVES WERE OF GRAY SUEDE
3546-9342-0013 EVEN WITH BECOMING HINT OF JAUNTINESS
3546-9342-0014 ESPECIALLY IF HIS TEMPER BE GENIAL EUGENE HAD BEGUN TO LOOK LIKE A MILLIONAIRE BUT ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE
3546-9342-0015 THE ANTICIPATION IN HIS EYES COULD HAVE BEEN READ BY A STRANGER HIS LOOK AT THE DOOR OF ISABEL'S HOUSE WAS THE LOOK OF A MAN WHO IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE NEXT MOMENT WILL REVEAL SOMETHING INEFFABLY CHARMING INEXPRESSIBLY DEAR
3546-9342-0016 GEORGE WENT SLOWLY TO THE FRONT DOOR AND HALTED REGARDING THE MISTY SILHOUETTE OF THE CALLER UPON THE ORNAMENTAL FROSTED GLASS AFTER A MINUTE OF WAITING THIS SILHOUETTE CHANGED OUTLINE SO THAT AN ARM COULD BE DISTINGUISHED
3546-9342-0017 AN ARM OUTSTRETCHED TOWARD THE BELL AS IF THE GENTLEMAN OUTSIDE DOUBTED WHETHER OR NOT IT HAD SOUNDED AND WERE MINDED TO TRY AGAIN BUT BEFORE THE GESTURE WAS COMPLETED GEORGE ABRUPTLY THREW OPEN THE DOOR AND STEPPED SQUARELY UPON THE MIDDLE OF THE THRESHOLD
3546-9342-0018 EUGENE WAS INCREDULOUS EVEN WHEN HIS SECOND GLANCE REVEALED HOW HOT OF EYE WAS THE HAGGARD YOUNG MAN BEFORE HIM I BEG YOUR PARDON I SAID I HEARD YOU SAID GEORGE YOU SAID YOU HAD AN ENGAGEMENT WITH MY MOTHER AND I TOLD YOU NO
3546-9342-0019 EUGENE GAVE HIM A STEADY LOOK
3546-9342-0020 WHAT IS THE THE DIFFICULTY GEORGE KEPT HIS OWN VOICE QUIET ENOUGH BUT THAT DID NOT MITIGATE THE VIBRANT FURY OF IT
3546-9342-0021 AND WITH THE LAST WORD HE CLOSED THE DOOR IN EUGENE'S FACE THEN NOT MOVING AWAY HE STOOD JUST INSIDE DOOR AND NOTED THAT THE MISTY SILHOUETTE REMAINED UPON THE FROSTED GLASS FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS
3546-9342-0022 EUGENE GOT INTO HIS CAR SLOWLY NOT LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE WHICH HAD JUST TAUGHT HIM SUCH A LESSON AND IT WAS EASILY VISIBLE EVEN FROM A WINDOW SEVENTY FEET DISTANT
3546-9342-0023 OBSERVING THE HEAVINESS OF HIS MOVEMENTS AS HE CLIMBED INTO THE TONNEAU GEORGE INDULGED IN A SICKISH THROAT RUMBLE WHICH BORE A DISTANT COUSINSHIP TO MIRTH THE CAR WAS QUICKER THAN ITS OWNER IT SHOT AWAY AS SOON AS HE HAD SUNK INTO HIS SEAT
3546-9342-0024 AND GEORGE HAVING WATCHED ITS IMPETUOUS DISAPPEARANCE FROM HIS FIELD OF VISION CEASED TO HAUNT THE WINDOW HE WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND SEATING HIMSELF BESIDE THE TABLE WHEREON HE HAD PLACED THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS FATHER PICKED UP A BOOK AND PRETENDED TO BE ENGAGED IN READING IT
3546-9342-0025 PRESENTLY ISABEL'S BUOYANT STEP WAS HEARD DESCENDING THE STAIRS AND HER LOW SWEET WHISTLING RENEWING THE AIR OF LORD BATEMAN SHE CAME INTO THE LIBRARY STILL WHISTLING THOUGHTFULLY A FUR COAT OVER HER ARM READY TO PUT ON
3546-9342-0026 AND TWO VEILS ROUND HER SMALL BLACK HAT HER RIGHT HAND ENGAGED IN BUTTONING THE GLOVE UPON HER LEFT AND AS THE LARGE ROOM CONTAINED TOO MANY PIECES OF HEAVY FURNITURE AND THE INSIDE SHUTTERS EXCLUDED MOST OF THE LIGHT OF DAY SHE DID NOT AT ONCE PERCEIVE GEORGE'S PRESENCE
3546-9342-0027 INSTEAD SHE WENT TO THE BAY WINDOW AT THE END OF THE ROOM WHICH AFFORDED A VIEW OF THE STREET AND GLANCED OUT EXPECTANTLY THEN BENT HER ATTENTION UPON HER GLOVE AFTER THAT LOOKED OUT TOWARD THE STREET AGAIN CEASED TO WHISTLE AND TURNED TOWARD THE INTERIOR OF THE ROOM
3546-9342-0028 A TINKLING BELL WAS AUDIBLE AND SHE MOVED TO THE DOORWAY INTO THE HALL I'M GOING OUT DRIVING DEAR I SHE INTERRUPTED HERSELF TO ADDRESS THE HOUSEMAID WHO WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HALL I THINK IT'S MISTER MORGAN MARY TELL HIM I'LL BE THERE AT ONCE YES MA'AM
3546-9342-0029 MARY RETURNED TWAS A PEDLAR MA'AM ANOTHER ONE ISABEL SAID SURPRISED I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS A PEDLAR WHEN THE BELL RANG A LITTLE WHILE AGO MISTER GEORGE SAID IT WAS MA'AM HE WENT TO THE DOOR MARY INFORMED HER DISAPPEARING
3546-9342-0030 THERE SEEM TO BE A GREAT MANY OF THEM ISABEL MUSED WHAT DID YOURS WANT TO SELL GEORGE HE DIDN'T SAY YOU MUST HAVE CUT HIM OFF SHORT SHE LAUGHED AND THEN STILL STANDING IN THE DOORWAY SHE NOTICED THE BIG SILVER FRAME UPON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM
3546-9342-0031 GRACIOUS GEORGIE SHE EXCLAIMED YOU HAVE BEEN INVESTING AND AS SHE CAME ACROSS THE ROOM FOR A CLOSER VIEW IS IT IS IT LUCY SHE ASKED HALF TIMIDLY HALF ARCHLY
3546-9342-0032 BUT THE NEXT INSTANT SHE SAW WHOSE LIKENESS WAS THUS SET FORTH IN ELEGIAC SPLENDOUR AND SHE WAS SILENT EXCEPT FOR A LONG JUST AUDIBLE OH HE NEITHER LOOKED UP NOR MOVED
3546-9342-0033 THEN AS GENTLY WITHDREW IT AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM BUT SHE DID NOT GO UPSTAIRS HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLE OF HER DRESS IN THE HALL AND THEN THE SOUND OF HER FOOTSTEPS IN THE RECEPTION ROOM
3546-9342-0034 AND SHE WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW EXPECTANTLY A LITTLE TROUBLED HE WENT BACK TO THE LIBRARY WAITED AN INTERMINABLE HALF HOUR THEN RETURNED NOISELESSLY TO THE SAME POSITION IN THE HALL WHERE HE COULD SEE HER SHE WAS STILL SITTING PATIENTLY BY THE WINDOW
