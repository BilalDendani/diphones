6206-14960-0016 NO I WON'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE BOOKS THEY'LL NEED TO BE DUSTED AND PUT IN BOXES THERE ARE A LOT OF BOXES IN THE CELLAR AND THERE'S A PILE OF PAPERS TO USE FOR LINING THE BOXES
6206-14960-0017 LET THE BOOKS GO TILL TO MORROW ALLISON WENT WHISTLING UP STAIRS AND BEGAN TAKING DOWN THE PICTURES BUT ANYBODY COULD SEE BY THE SET OF HIS SHOULDERS THAT HE MEANT TO GET THE BOOKS OUT OF THE WAY TOO BEFORE NOON
6206-14960-0018 EVERYTHING IS TIED UP AND LABELLED I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DISTURB IT THE MEN CAN MOVE IT UP AS IT IS BUT WE NEED TO GET THE REST OF THE BED CLOTHES OUT ON THE LINE FOR AN AIRING BEFORE I PACK THEM AWAY IN THE CHEST UP STAIRS YOU MIGHT DO THAT
6206-14960-0019 SO LESLIE WENT BACK AND FORTH CARRYING BLANKETS AND QUILTS AND HANGING THEM ON THE LINE TILL MISSUS PERKINS HAD TO COME OVER TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON SHE CAME WITH A CUP IN HER HAND TO ASK FOR SOME BAKING POWDER AND JULIA CLOUD GAVE HER THE WHOLE BOX
6206-14960-0020 NO YOU NEEDN'T RETURN IT SHE SAID SMILING I SHALL NOT NEED IT I'VE RENTED THE HOUSE AND AM GOING AWAY FOR A WHILE MISSUS PERKINS WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE ACTUALLY WENT HOME WITHOUT FINDING OUT WHERE JULIA CLOUD WAS GOING AND HAD TO COME BACK TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING SHE COULD DO TO HELP
6206-14960-0021 THE ROOMS HAD ASSUMED THAT CLEARED UP READY LOOK THAT RESTS THE TIRED WORKER JUST TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH A CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS BEING QUITE A CHILD TO RUN AWAY THIS WAY WHEN THERE WAS STILL A LOT TO BE DONE
6206-14960-0022 THE CAR WAS ALREADY AT THE DOOR AND SHE FELT ALMOST GUILTY AS SHE LOCKED THE DOOR AND WENT DOWN THE PATH BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE DAY INTOXICATED HER AT ONCE AND SHE FORGOT IMMEDIATELY EVERYTHING BUT THE JOY OF RIDING OUT INTO THE WORLD
6206-14960-0023 LESLIE WAS A BIT QUIET AS THEY GLIDED DOWN THE ROAD OUT OF TOWN AND KEPT EYEING HER AUNT SILENTLY AT LAST AS JULIA CLOUD WAS CALLING ATTENTION TO A WONDERFUL RED WOODBINE THAT HAD TWINED ITSELF ABOUT AN OLD DEAD TREE AND WAS SETTING THE ROADSIDE ABLAZE WITH SPLENDOR
6206-14960-0024 LESLIE CAUGHT HER EYE WHAT IS IT DEAR DOES SOMETHING TROUBLE YOU IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME ASKED JULIA CLOUD PUTTING UP A PROSPECTING HAND TO HER HAIR AND HAT LESLIE'S CHEEKS WENT ROSY RED O CLOUDY DEAR SAID LESLIE I WAS JUST WONDERING

6206-14960-0043 AND COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM THROWING HER ARMS ABOUT THE CHILDREN RIGHT THERE IN THE STORE BUT SHE STOPPED IN TIME AND LET HER EYES DO THE CARESSING AS SHE SAID WITH A TREMBLE IN HER LOW SWEET VOICE O YOU DEAR CHILDREN HOW YOU ARE GOING TO SPOIL ME

6206-14960-0051 BUT HER EAGER FINGERS UNTIED THE STRING WHILE LESLIE AND ALLISON EXECUTED LITTLE SILENT DANCES AROUND THE ROOM AND TRIED TO STIFLE THEIR MIRTH THE COVER FELL OFF AT LAST AND THE TISSUE PAPER BLEW UP IN A GREAT FLUFF
6206-14960-0052 AND OUT OF IT ROLLED A BEAUTIFUL LONG SOFT THICK GRAY CLOAK OF FINEST TEXTURE AND SILKEN LINING WITH A GREAT PUFFY COLLAR AND CUFFS OF DEEP SOFT SILVER GRAY FOX
