5952-54019-0010 THEN DOWN HE TOOK HIS FUR CAP AND UP HE TOOK HIS NETS AND OFF HE AND THE OLD MAN MARCHED THROUGH THE MOONLIGHT THEIR SHADOWS BOBBING ALONG LIKE BLACK SPIDERS BEHIND THEM WELL ON THEY WENT
5952-54019-0011 OUT FROM THE TOWN AND ACROSS THE FIELDS AND THROUGH THE WOODS UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO A DREARY LONESOME DESERT WHERE NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT GRAY ROCKS AND WEEDS AND THISTLES

5952-54019-0024 THE FISHERMAN UNROLLED HIS NETS AND CAST THEM AND DRAGGED THEM AND THEN CAST THEM AND DRAGGED THEM AGAIN BUT NEITHER TIME CAUGHT SO MUCH AS A HERRING BUT THE THIRD TIME
5952-54019-0025 THAT HE CAST HE FOUND THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SOMETHING THAT WEIGHED AS HEAVY AS LEAD HE PULLED AND PULLED UNTIL BY AND BY HE DRAGGED THE LOAD ASHORE AND WHAT SHOULD IT BE BUT A GREAT CHEST OF WOOD BLACKENED BY THE SEA WATER
5952-54019-0026 AND COVERED WITH SHELLS AND GREEN MOSS THAT WAS THE VERY THING THAT THE MAGICIAN HAD COME TO FISH FOR FROM HIS POUCH THE OLD MAN TOOK A LITTLE GOLDEN KEY WHICH HE FITTED INTO A KEY HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE CHEST
5952-54019-0027 HE THREW BACK THE LID THE FISHERMAN LOOKED WITHIN AND THERE WAS THE PRETTIEST LITTLE PALACE THAT MAN'S EYE EVER BEHELD ALL MADE OF MOTHER OF PEARL AND SILVER FROSTED AS WHITE AS SNOW
5952-54019-0028 FOR THE PALACE INSTANTLY BEGAN TO GROW FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE UNTIL IT STOOD IN THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING AND GLISTENING LIKE SNOW
5952-54019-0029 THE WINDOWS BRIGHT WITH THE LIGHTS OF A THOUSAND WAX TAPERS AND THE SOUND OF MUSIC AND VOICES AND LAUGHTER COMING FROM WITHIN HARDLY COULD THE FISHERMAN CATCH HIS BREATH FROM ONE STRANGE THING WHEN ANOTHER HAPPENED
5952-54019-0030 THE OLD MAGICIAN TOOK OFF HIS CLOTHES AND HIS FACE YES HIS FACE FOR ALL THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A MASK AND THERE STOOD AS HANDSOME AND NOBLE A YOUNG MAN AS EVER THE LIGHT LOOKED ON THEN BECKONING TO THE FISHERMAN DUMB WITH WONDER
5952-54019-0031 AS HE CAME THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN WITH A BLAZE OF LIGHT AND THERE STOOD HUNDREDS OF NOBLEMEN ALL CLAD IN SILKS AND SATINS AND VELVETS WHO WHEN THEY SAW THE MAGICIAN BOWED LOW BEFORE HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A KING
5952-54019-0032 LEADING THE WAY THEY BROUGHT THE TWO THROUGH HALLS AND CHAMBERS AND ROOM AFTER ROOM EACH MORE MAGNIFICENT THAN THE OTHER UNTIL THEY CAME TO ONE THAT SURPASSED A HUNDREDFOLD ANY OF THE OTHERS
5952-54019-0033 AT THE FARTHER END WAS A GOLDEN THRONE AND UPON IT SAT A LADY MORE LOVELY AND BEAUTIFUL THAN A DREAM HER EYES AS BRIGHT AS DIAMONDS HER CHEEKS LIKE ROSE LEAVES AND HER HAIR LIKE SPUN GOLD
5952-54019-0034 SHE CAME HALF WAY DOWN THE STEPS OF THE THRONE TO WELCOME THE MAGICIAN AND WHEN THE TWO MET THEY KISSED ONE ANOTHER BEFORE ALL THOSE WHO WERE LOOKING ON THEN SHE BROUGHT HIM TO THE THRONE AND SEATED HIM BESIDE HER AND THERE THEY TALKED FOR A LONG TIME VERY EARNESTLY
5952-54019-0035 NOBODY SAID A WORD TO THE FISHERMAN WHO STOOD STARING ABOUT HIM LIKE AN OWL I WONDER SAID HE TO HIMSELF AT LAST
5952-54019-0036 IF THEY WILL GIVE A BODY A BITE TO EAT BY AND BY FOR TO TELL THE TRUTH THE GOOD SUPPER THAT HE HAD COME AWAY FROM AT HOME HAD LEFT A SHARP HUNGER GNAWING AT HIS INSIDES AND HE LONGED FOR SOMETHING GOOD AND WARM TO FILL THE EMPTY PLACE BUT TIME PASSED
5952-54019-0037 AND NOT SO MUCH AS A CRUST OF BREAD WAS BROUGHT TO STAY HIS STOMACH BY AND BY THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND THEN THE TWO WHO SAT UPON THE THRONE AROSE THE BEAUTIFUL LADY TOOK THE MAGICIAN BY THE HAND AND TURNING TO THOSE WHO STOOD AROUND SAID IN A LOUD VOICE
5952-54019-0038 BEHOLD HIM WHO ALONE IS WORTHY TO POSSESS THE JEWEL OF JEWELS UNTO HIM DO I GIVE IT AND WITH IT ALL POWER OF POWERS THEREON SHE OPENED A GOLDEN CASKET THAT STOOD BESIDE HER

5952-54019-0043 IT IS SAID THE BEAUTIFUL LADY THEN GOD BLESS YOUR PRETTY EYES SAID THE FISHERMAN THEN THE MAGICIAN KISSED THE BEAUTIFUL LADY AND BECKONING TO THE FISHERMAN LEFT THE THRONE ROOM THE SAME WAY THAT THEY HAD COME
5952-54019-0044 THE NOBLEMEN IN SILKS AND SATINS AND VELVETS MARCHED AHEAD AND BACK THEY WENT THROUGH THE OTHER APARTMENTS UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE DOOR OUT THEY STEPPED AND THEN WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HAPPENED
5952-54019-0045 IF THE WONDERFUL PALACE HAD GROWN LIKE A BUBBLE LIKE A BUBBLE IT VANISHED THERE THE TWO STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT ROCKS AND SAND AND WATER AND THE STARRY SKY OVERHEAD
5952-54019-0046 THE FISHERMAN SHOOK HIS CAP OF GOLD AND IT JINGLED AND TINKLED AND WAS AS HEAVY AS LEAD IF IT WAS NOT ALL A DREAM HE WAS RICH FOR LIFE BUT ANYHOW SAID HE THEY MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A BODY A BITE TO EAT
5952-54019-0047 THE MAGICIAN PUT ON HIS RED CLOTHES AND HIS FACE AGAIN MAKING HIMSELF AS HOARY AND AS OLD AS BEFORE HE TOOK OUT HIS FLINT AND STEEL AND HIS STICKS OF SPICE WOOD AND HIS GRAY POWDER AND MADE A GREAT FIRE AND SMOKE JUST AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE
5952-54019-0048 THEN AGAIN HE TIED HIS HANDKERCHIEF OVER THE FISHERMAN'S EYES REMEMBER SAID HE WHAT I TOLD YOU WHEN WE STARTED UPON OUR JOURNEY KEEP YOUR MOUTH TIGHT SHUT FOR IF YOU UTTER SO MUCH AS A SINGLE WORD YOU ARE A LOST MAN
5952-54019-0049 NOW THROW YOUR LEG OVER WHAT YOU FEEL AND HOLD FAST THE FISHERMAN HAD HIS NET OVER ONE ARM AND HIS CAP OF GOLD IN THE OTHER HAND NEVERTHELESS THERE HE FELT THE SAME HAIRY THING HE HAD FELT BEFORE
5952-54019-0050 HE FLUNG HIS LEG OVER IT AND AWAY HE WAS GONE THROUGH THE AIR LIKE A SKY ROCKET NOW HE HAD GROWN SOMEWHAT USED TO STRANGE THINGS BY THIS TIME SO HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT SORT OF A CREATURE IT WAS UPON WHICH HE WAS RIDING THUS THROUGH THE SKY
5952-54019-0051 SO HE CONTRIVED IN SPITE OF HIS NET AND CAP TO PUSH UP THE HANDKERCHIEF FROM OVER ONE EYE OUT HE PEEPED AND THEN HE SAW AS CLEAR AS DAY WHAT THE STRANGE STEED WAS
5952-54019-0052 HE WAS RIDING UPON A HE GOAT AS BLACK AS NIGHT AND IN FRONT OF HIM WAS THE MAGICIAN RIDING UPON JUST SUCH ANOTHER HIS GREAT RED ROBE FLUTTERING OUT BEHIND HIM IN THE MOONLIGHT LIKE HUGE RED WINGS GREAT HERRING AND LITTLE FISHES ROARED THE FISHERMAN
5952-54019-0053 INSTANTLY GOATS OLD MAN AND ALL WERE GONE LIKE A FLASH DOWN FELL THE FISHERMAN THROUGH THE EMPTY SKY WHIRLING OVER AND OVER AND AROUND AND AROUND LIKE A FROG HE HELD TIGHTLY TO HIS NET BUT AWAY FLEW HIS FUR CAP
