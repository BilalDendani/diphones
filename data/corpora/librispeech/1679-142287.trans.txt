1679-142287-0000 THAT DEATH ITSELF SHALL NOT REMAIN THAT WEARY DESERTS WE MAY TREAD A DREARY LABYRINTH MAY THREAD THRO DARK WAYS UNDERGROUND BE LED YET IF WE WILL ONE GUIDE OBEY
1679-142287-0001 THE DREARIEST PATH THE DARKEST WAY SHALL ISSUE OUT IN HEAVENLY DAY AND WE ON DIVERS SHORES NOW CAST SHALL MEET OUR PERILOUS VOYAGE PAST ALL IN OUR FATHER'S HOUSE AT LAST R C TRENCH
1679-142287-0002 MARGARET FLEW UPSTAIRS AS SOON AS THEIR VISITORS WERE GONE AND PUT ON HER BONNET AND SHAWL TO RUN AND INQUIRE HOW BESSY HIGGINS WAS AND SIT WITH HER AS LONG AS SHE COULD BEFORE DINNER
1679-142287-0003 AS SHE WENT ALONG THE CROWDED NARROW STREETS SHE FELT HOW MUCH OF INTEREST THEY HAD GAINED BY THE SIMPLE FACT OF HER HAVING LEARNT TO CARE FOR A DWELLER IN THEM
1679-142287-0004 THERE HAD BEEN ROUGH STONING DONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR WHILE THE FLAGS UNDER THE CHAIRS AND TABLE AND ROUND THE WALLS RETAINED THEIR DARK UNWASHED APPEARANCE ALTHOUGH THE DAY WAS HOT THERE BURNT A LARGE FIRE IN THE GRATE
1679-142287-0005 MAKING THE WHOLE PLACE FEEL LIKE AN OVEN MARGARET DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAVISHNESS OF COALS WAS A SIGN OF HOSPITABLE WELCOME TO HER ON MARY'S PART AND THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE OPPRESSIVE HEAT WAS NECESSARY FOR BESSY
1679-142287-0006 BESSY HERSELF LAY ON A SQUAB OR SHORT SOFA PLACED UNDER THE WINDOW SHE WAS VERY MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND TIRED WITH RAISING HERSELF AT EVERY STEP TO LOOK OUT AND SEE IF IT WAS MARGARET COMING
1679-142287-0007 AND NOW THAT MARGARET WAS THERE AND HAD TAKEN A CHAIR BY HER BESSY LAY BACK SILENT AND CONTENT TO LOOK AT MARGARET'S FACE AND TOUCH HER ARTICLES OF DRESS WITH A CHILDISH ADMIRATION OF THEIR FINENESS OF TEXTURE
1679-142287-0008 I NEVER KNEW WHY FOLK IN THE BIBLE CARED FOR SOFT RAIMENT AFORE BUT IT MUST BE NICE TO GO DRESSED AS YO DO IT'S DIFFERENT FRO COMMON MOST FINE FOLK TIRE MY EYES OUT WI THEIR COLOURS BUT SOME HOW YOURS REST ME
1679-142287-0009 WHERE DID YE GET THIS FROCK IN LONDON SAID MARGARET MUCH AMUSED LONDON HAVE YO BEEN IN LONDON YES I LIVED THERE FOR SOME YEARS BUT MY HOME WAS IN A FOREST IN THE COUNTRY TELL ME ABOUT IT SAID BESSY
1679-142287-0010 AND TREES AND SUCH LIKE THINGS
1679-142287-0011 LYING AT PERFECT REST AS IF TO RECEIVE ALL THE IDEAS MARGARET COULD SUGGEST MARGARET HAD NEVER SPOKEN OF HELSTONE SINCE SHE LEFT IT EXCEPT JUST NAMING THE PLACE INCIDENTALLY
1679-142287-0012 SHE SAW IT IN DREAMS MORE VIVID THAN LIFE AND AS SHE FELL AWAY TO SLUMBER AT NIGHTS HER MEMORY WANDERED IN ALL ITS PLEASANT PLACES BUT HER HEART WAS OPENED TO THIS GIRL OH BESSY
1679-142287-0013 I WISH YOU COULD SEE IT I CANNOT TELL YOU HALF ITS BEAUTY THERE ARE GREAT TREES STANDING ALL ABOUT IT WITH THEIR BRANCHES STRETCHING LONG AND LEVEL AND MAKING A DEEP SHADE OF REST EVEN AT NOONDAY
1679-142287-0014 AND YET THOUGH EVERY LEAF MAY SEEM STILL THERE IS A CONTINUAL RUSHING SOUND OF MOVEMENT ALL AROUND NOT CLOSE AT HAND
1679-142287-0015 HIDDEN TINKLING BROOK NEAR AT HAND AND THEN IN OTHER PARTS THERE ARE BILLOWY FERNS WHOLE STRETCHES OF FERN SOME IN THE GREEN SHADOW SOME WITH LONG STREAKS OF GOLDEN SUNLIGHT LYING ON THEM JUST LIKE THE SEA
1679-142287-0016 I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE SEA MURMURED BESSY BUT GO ON THEN HERE AND THERE THERE ARE WIDE COMMONS HIGH UP AS IF ABOVE THE VERY TOPS OF THE TREES I'M GLAD OF THAT I FELT SMOTHERED LIKE DOWN BELOW
1679-142287-0017 WHEN I HAVE GONE FOR AN OUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GET HIGH UP AND SEE FAR AWAY
1679-142287-0018 AND I THINK THE SOUND YO SPEAK OF AMONG THE TREES GOING ON FOR EVER AND EVER WOULD SEND ME DAZED
1679-142287-0019 NOW ON THESE COMMONS I RECKON THERE IS BUT LITTLE NOISE NO SAID MARGARET NOTHING BUT HERE AND THERE A LARK HIGH IN THE AIR
1679-142287-0020 I USED TO THINK ONCE THAT IF I COULD HAVE A DAY OF DOING NOTHING
1679-142287-0021 AS I WAS O MY WORK SOMETIMES I'M SO TIRED OUT I THINK I CANNOT ENJOY HEAVEN WITHOUT A PIECE OF REST FIRST
1679-142287-0022 DON'T BE AFRAID BESSY SAID MARGARET LAYING HER HAND ON THE GIRL'S GOD CAN GIVE YOU MORE PERFECT REST THAN EVEN IDLENESS ON EARTH OR THE DEAD SLEEP OF THE GRAVE CAN DO BESSY MOVED UNEASILY THEN SHE SAID
1679-142287-0023 I WISH FATHER WOULD NOT SPEAK AS HE DOES
1679-142287-0024 I DON'T BELIEVE HIM A BIT BY DAY YET BY NIGHT WHEN I'M IN A FEVER HALF ASLEEP AND HALF AWAKE IT COMES BACK UPON ME OH SO BAD
1679-142287-0025 AND IF ALL I'VE BEEN BORN FOR IS JUST TO WORK MY HEART AND MY LIFE AWAY AND TO SICKEN THIS DREE PLACE WI THEM MILL NOISES IN MY EARS FOR EVER UNTIL I COULD SCREAM OUT FOR THEM TO STOP
1679-142287-0026 AND MY MOTHER GONE AND I NEVER ABLE TO TELL HER AGAIN HOW I LOVED HER
1679-142287-0027 SITTING UP AND CLUTCHING VIOLENTLY ALMOST FIERCELY AT MARGARET'S HAND I COULD GO MAD AND KILL YO I COULD SHE FELL BACK COMPLETELY WORN OUT WITH HER PASSION MARGARET KNELT DOWN BY HER
1679-142287-0028 BESSY WE HAVE A FATHER IN HEAVEN I KNOW IT I KNOW IT MOANED SHE TURNING HER HEAD UNEASILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE I'M VERY WICKED I'VE SPOKEN VERY WICKEDLY OH DON'T BE FRIGHTENED BY ME AND NEVER COME AGAIN I WOULD NOT HARM A HAIR OF YOUR HEAD
1679-142287-0029 AND OPENING HER EYES AND LOOKING EARNESTLY AT MARGARET
1679-142287-0030 I READ THE BOOK O REVELATIONS UNTIL I KNOW IT OFF BY HEART AND I NEVER DOUBT WHEN I'M WAKING AND IN MY SENSES OF ALL THE GLORY I'M TO COME TO
1679-142287-0031 DON'T LET US TALK OF WHAT FANCIES COME INTO YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU ARE FEVERISH I WOULD RATHER HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT YOU USED TO DO WHEN YOU WERE WELL I THINK I WAS WELL WHEN MOTHER DIED BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN RIGHTLY STRONG SIN SOMEWHERE ABOUT THAT TIME
1679-142287-0032 I BEGAN TO WORK IN A CARDING ROOM SOON AFTER AND THE FLUFF GOT INTO MY LUNGS AND POISONED ME FLUFF SAID MARGARET INQUIRINGLY FLUFF REPEATED BESSY LITTLE BITS AS FLY OFF FRO THE COTTON WHEN THEY'RE CARDING IT
1679-142287-0033 AND FILL THE AIR TILL IT LOOKS ALL FINE WHITE DUST THEY SAY IT WINDS ROUND THE LUNGS AND TIGHTENS THEM UP
1679-142287-0034 JUST POISONED BY THE FLUFF BUT CAN'T IT BE HELPED ASKED MARGARET I DUNNO SOME FOLK HAVE A GREAT WHEEL AT ONE END O THEIR CARDING ROOMS TO MAKE A DRAUGHT
1679-142287-0035 BUT THAT WHEEL COSTS A DEAL O MONEY FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED POUND MAYBE AND BRINGS IN NO PROFIT
1679-142287-0036 THEIR WAGE OUGHT TO BE RAISED IF THEY WERE TO WORK IN SUCH PLACES
1679-142287-0037 I KNOW I WISH THERE'D BEEN A WHEEL IN OUR PLACE THOUGH DID NOT YOUR FATHER KNOW ABOUT IT ASKED MARGARET YES AND HE WERE SORRY BUT OUR FACTORY WERE A GOOD ONE ON THE WHOLE
1679-142287-0038 FOR THOUGH YO WOULD NA THINK IT NOW MANY A ONE THEN USED TO CALL ME A GRADELY LASS ENOUGH AND I DID NA LIKE TO BE RECKONED NESH AND SOFT AND MARY'S SCHOOLING WERE TO BE KEPT UP MOTHER SAID AND FATHER HE WERE ALWAYS LIKING TO BUY BOOKS AND GO TO LECTURES O ONE KIND OR ANOTHER
1679-142287-0039 HOW OLD ARE YOU ASKED MARGARET NINETEEN COME JULY AND I TOO AM NINETEEN SHE THOUGHT MORE SORROWFULLY THAN BESSY DID OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THEM
1679-142287-0040 ABOUT MARY SAID BESSY I WANTED TO ASK YO TO BE A FRIEND TO HER
1679-142287-0041 SHE COULD NOT D O MARGARET GLANCED UNCONSCIOUSLY AT THE UNCLEANED CORNERS OF THE ROOM
1679-142287-0042 WE HAVE AN OLD FAITHFUL SERVANT ALMOST A FRIEND WHO WANTS HELP BUT WHO IS VERY PARTICULAR AND IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT TO PLAGUE HER WITH GIVING HER ANY ASSISTANCE THAT WOULD REALLY BE AN ANNOYANCE AND AN IRRITATION
1679-142287-0043 NO I SEE I RECKON YO'RE RIGHT OUR MARY'S A GOOD WENCH
1679-142287-0044 NO MOTHER AND ME AT THE MILL TILL I WERE GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT SCOLDING HER FOR DOING BADLY WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO A BIT
1679-142287-0045 AND NOW I MUST GO I WILL COME AGAIN AS SOON AS I CAN BUT IF IT SHOULD NOT BE TO MORROW OR THE NEXT DAY OR EVEN A WEEK OR A FORTNIGHT HENCE DON'T THINK I'VE FORGOTTEN YOU I MAY BE BUSY I'LL KNOW YO WON'T FORGET ME AGAIN I'LL NOT MISTRUST YO NO MORE

1679-142287-0047 FROM THAT DAY FORWARDS MISSUS HALE BECAME MORE AND MORE OF A SUFFERING INVALID IT WAS NOW DRAWING NEAR TO THE ANNIVERSARY OF EDITH'S MARRIAGE AND LOOKING BACK UPON THE YEAR'S ACCUMULATED HEAP OF TROUBLES
1679-142287-0048 IF SHE COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED THEM HOW SHE WOULD HAVE SHRUNK AWAY AND HID HERSELF FROM THE COMING TIME AND YET DAY BY DAY HAD OF ITSELF AND BY ITSELF BEEN VERY ENDURABLE
1679-142287-0049 SMALL KEEN BRIGHT LITTLE SPOTS OF POSITIVE ENJOYMENT HAVING COME SPARKLING INTO THE VERY MIDDLE OF SORROWS A YEAR AGO OR WHEN SHE FIRST WENT TO HELSTONE AND FIRST BECAME SILENTLY CONSCIOUS OF THE QUERULOUSNESS IN HER MOTHER'S TEMPER
1679-142287-0050 BUT WITH THE INCREASE OF SERIOUS AND JUST GROUND OF COMPLAINT A NEW KIND OF PATIENCE HAD SPRUNG UP IN HER MOTHER'S MIND
1679-142287-0051 MISTER HALE WAS IN EXACTLY THAT STAGE OF APPREHENSION WHICH IN MEN OF HIS STAMP TAKES THE SHAPE OF WILFUL BLINDNESS HE WAS MORE IRRITATED THAN MARGARET HAD EVER KNOWN HIM AT HIS DAUGHTER'S EXPRESSED ANXIETY
1679-142287-0052 INDEED MARGARET YOU ARE GROWING FANCIFUL GOD KNOWS I SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO TAKE THE ALARM IF YOUR MOTHER WERE REALLY ILL WE ALWAYS SAW WHEN SHE HAD HER HEADACHES AT HELSTONE EVEN WITHOUT HER TELLING US SHE LOOKS QUITE PALE AND WHITE WHEN SHE IS ILL
1679-142287-0053 AND NOW SHE HAS A BRIGHT HEALTHY COLOUR IN HER CHEEKS JUST AS SHE USED TO HAVE WHEN I FIRST KNEW HER BUT PAPA SAID MARGARET WITH HESITATION DO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IS THE FLUSH OF PAIN NONSENSE MARGARET I TELL YOU YOU ARE TOO FANCIFUL
1679-142287-0054 YOU ARE THE PERSON NOT WELL I THINK SEND FOR THE DOCTOR TO MORROW FOR YOURSELF AND THEN IF IT WILL MAKE YOUR MIND EASIER HE CAN SEE YOUR MOTHER THANK YOU DEAR PAPA IT WILL MAKE ME HAPPIER INDEED AND SHE WENT UP TO HIM TO KISS HIM
1679-142287-0055 BUT HE PUSHED HER AWAY GENTLY ENOUGH BUT STILL AS IF SHE HAD SUGGESTED UNPLEASANT IDEAS WHICH HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO GET RID OF AS READILY AS HE COULD OF HER PRESENCE HE WALKED UNEASILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM POOR MARIA SAID HE HALF SOLILOQUISING
1679-142287-0056 NO PAPA SAID MARGARET SADLY THEN YOU SEE SHE CAN'T BE FRETTING AFTER THEM EH IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A COMFORT TO ME TO THINK THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS SO SIMPLE AND OPEN THAT I KNEW EVERY LITTLE GRIEVANCE SHE HAD
1679-142287-0057 SHE NEVER WOULD CONCEAL ANYTHING SERIOUSLY AFFECTING HER HEALTH FROM ME WOULD SHE EH MARGARET I AM QUITE SURE SHE WOULD NOT SO DON'T LET ME HEAR OF THESE FOOLISH MORBID IDEAS
