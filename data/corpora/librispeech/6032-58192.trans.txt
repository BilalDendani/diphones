6032-58192-0000 CHAPTER ONE WHERE I WAS BORN MY LIFE HAS BEEN AN EVENTFUL ONE I WAS BORN A SLAVE WAS THE CHILD OF SLAVE PARENTS
6032-58192-0001 THEREFORE I CAME UPON THE EARTH FREE IN GOD LIKE THOUGHT BUT FETTERED IN ACTION
6032-58192-0002 MY RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD ARE DISTINCT PERHAPS FOR THE REASON THAT MANY STIRRING INCIDENTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PERIOD I AM NOW ON THE SHADY SIDE OF FORTY
6032-58192-0003 AND AS I SIT ALONE IN MY ROOM THE BRAIN IS BUSY AND A RAPIDLY MOVING PANORAMA BRINGS SCENE AFTER SCENE BEFORE ME SOME PLEASANT AND OTHERS SAD
6032-58192-0004 AND WHEN I THUS GREET OLD FAMILIAR FACES I OFTEN FIND MYSELF WONDERING IF I AM NOT LIVING THE PAST OVER AGAIN THE VISIONS ARE SO TERRIBLY DISTINCT
6032-58192-0005 THAT I ALMOST IMAGINE THEM TO BE REAL HOUR AFTER HOUR I SIT WHILE THE SCENES ARE BEING SHIFTED AND AS I GAZE UPON THE PANORAMA OF THE PAST
6032-58192-0006 I REALIZE HOW CROWDED WITH INCIDENTS MY LIFE HAS BEEN EVERY DAY SEEMS LIKE A ROMANCE WITHIN ITSELF AND THE YEARS GROW INTO PONDEROUS VOLUMES
6032-58192-0007 AS I CANNOT CONDENSE I MUST OMIT MANY STRANGE PASSAGES IN MY HISTORY FROM SUCH A WILDERNESS OF EVENTS IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A SELECTION
6032-58192-0008 BUT AS I AM NOT WRITING ALTOGETHER THE HISTORY OF MYSELF I WILL CONFINE MY STORY TO THE MOST IMPORTANT INCIDENTS WHICH I BELIEVE INFLUENCED THE MOULDING OF MY CHARACTER
6032-58192-0009 AS I GLANCE OVER THE CROWDED SEA OF THE PAST THESE INCIDENTS STAND FORTH PROMINENTLY THE GUIDE POSTS OF MEMORY I PRESUME THAT I MUST HAVE BEEN FOUR YEARS OLD
6032-58192-0010 WHEN I FIRST BEGAN TO REMEMBER AT LEAST I CANNOT NOW RECALL ANYTHING OCCURRING PREVIOUS TO THIS PERIOD MY MASTER COLONEL A BURWELL WAS SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED IN HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS
6032-58192-0011 AND WHILE I WAS YET AN INFANT HE MADE SEVERAL REMOVALS WHILE LIVING AT HAMPTON SIDNEY COLLEGE PRINCE EDWARD COUNTY VIRGINIA MISSUS BURWELL GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER
6032-58192-0012 A SWEET BLACK EYED BABY MY EARLIEST AND FONDEST PET TO TAKE CARE OF THIS BABY WAS MY FIRST DUTY TRUE I WAS BUT A CHILD MYSELF ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD
6032-58192-0013 BUT THEN I HAD BEEN RAISED IN A HARDY SCHOOL HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO RELY UPON MYSELF AND TO PREPARE MYSELF TO RENDER ASSISTANCE TO OTHERS THE LESSON WAS NOT A BITTER ONE
6032-58192-0014 FOR I WAS TOO YOUNG TO INDULGE IN PHILOSOPHY AND THE PRECEPTS THAT I THEN TREASURED AND PRACTISED I BELIEVE DEVELOPED THOSE PRINCIPLES OF CHARACTER WHICH HAVE ENABLED ME TO TRIUMPH OVER SO MANY DIFFICULTIES
6032-58192-0015 NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE WRONGS THAT SLAVERY HEAPED UPON ME I CAN BLESS IT FOR ONE THING YOUTH'S IMPORTANT LESSON OF SELF RELIANCE
6032-58192-0016 AND IT WAS PLEASANT TO ME TO BE ASSIGNED A DUTY IN CONNECTION WITH IT FOR THE DISCHARGE OF THAT DUTY TRANSFERRED ME FROM THE RUDE CABIN TO THE HOUSEHOLD OF MY MASTER
6032-58192-0017 MY SIMPLE ATTIRE WAS A SHORT DRESS AND A LITTLE WHITE APRON MY OLD MISTRESS ENCOURAGED ME IN ROCKING THE CRADLE BY TELLING ME THAT IF I WOULD WATCH OVER THE BABY WELL
6032-58192-0018 KEEP THE FLIES OUT OF ITS FACE AND NOT LET IT CRY I SHOULD BE ITS LITTLE MAID THIS WAS A GOLDEN PROMISE AND I REQUIRED NO BETTER INDUCEMENT FOR THE FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE OF MY TASK
6032-58192-0019 I BEGAN TO ROCK THE CRADLE MOST INDUSTRIOUSLY WHEN LO OUT PITCHED LITTLE PET ON THE FLOOR
6032-58192-0020 OH THE BABY IS ON THE FLOOR AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I SEIZED THE FIRE SHOVEL IN MY PERPLEXITY AND WAS TRYING TO SHOVEL UP MY TENDER CHARGE WHEN MY MISTRESS CALLED TO ME TO LET THE CHILD ALONE
6032-58192-0021 WAS THE CAUSE OF MUCH TROUBLE TO ME I GREW STRONG AND HEALTHY AND NOTWITHSTANDING I KNIT SOCKS AND ATTENDED TO VARIOUS KINDS OF WORK I WAS REPEATEDLY TOLD WHEN EVEN FOURTEEN YEARS OLD
6032-58192-0022 MY MOTHER WAS KIND AND FORBEARING MISSUS BURWELL A HARD TASK MASTER AND AS MOTHER HAD SO MUCH WORK TO DO IN MAKING CLOTHES ET CETERA FOR THE FAMILY BESIDES THE SLAVES
6032-58192-0023 I DETERMINED TO RENDER HER ALL THE ASSISTANCE IN MY POWER AND IN RENDERING HER SUCH ASSISTANCE MY YOUNG ENERGIES WERE TAXED TO THE UTMOST I WAS MY MOTHER'S ONLY CHILD
6032-58192-0024 WHICH MADE HER LOVE FOR ME ALL THE STRONGER I DID NOT KNOW MUCH OF MY FATHER FOR HE WAS THE SLAVE OF ANOTHER MAN AND WHEN MISTER BURWELL MOVED FROM DINWIDDIE HE WAS SEPARATED FROM US
6032-58192-0025 AND ONLY ALLOWED TO VISIT MY MOTHER TWICE A YEAR DURING THE EASTER HOLIDAYS AND CHRISTMAS AT LAST MISTER BURWELL DETERMINED TO REWARD MY MOTHER
6032-58192-0026 BY MAKING AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE OWNER OF MY FATHER BY WHICH THE SEPARATION OF MY PARENTS COULD BE BROUGHT TO AN END IT WAS A BRIGHT DAY INDEED FOR MY MOTHER
6032-58192-0027 WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT MY FATHER WAS COMING TO LIVE WITH US THE OLD WEARY LOOK FADED FROM HER FACE AND SHE WORKED AS IF HER HEART WAS IN EVERY TASK
6032-58192-0028 BUT THE GOLDEN DAYS DID NOT LAST LONG THE RADIANT DREAM FADED ALL TOO SOON IN THE MORNING MY FATHER CALLED ME TO HIM AND KISSED ME
6032-58192-0029 THEN HELD ME OUT AT ARMS LENGTH AS IF HE WERE REGARDING HIS CHILD WITH PRIDE SHE IS GROWING INTO A LARGE FINE GIRL HE REMARKED TO MY MOTHER I DUN NO WHICH I LIKE BEST YOU
6032-58192-0030 OR LIZZIE AS BOTH ARE SO DEAR TO ME MY MOTHER'S NAME WAS AGNES AND MY FATHER DELIGHTED TO CALL ME HIS LITTLE LIZZIE WHILE YET MY FATHER AND MOTHER WERE SPEAKING HOPEFULLY
6032-58192-0031 HIS LAST KISS HIS WILD STRAINING OF MY MOTHER TO HIS BOSOM THE SOLEMN PRAYER TO HEAVEN THE TEARS AND SOBS
6032-58192-0032 THE SHADOW ECLIPSED THE SUNSHINE AND LOVE BROUGHT DESPAIR THE PARTING WAS ETERNAL THE CLOUD HAD NO SILVER LINING
6032-58192-0033 EARN OUR RIGHT TO ENJOY THE SUNSHINE IN THE GREAT HEREAFTER AT THE GRAVE AT LEAST WE SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO LAY OUR BURDENS DOWN THAT A NEW WORLD A WORLD OF BRIGHTNESS
6032-58192-0034 DEEP AS WAS THE DISTRESS OF MY MOTHER IN PARTING WITH MY FATHER HER SORROW DID NOT SCREEN HER FROM INSULT MY OLD MISTRESS SAID TO HER STOP YOUR NONSENSE
6032-58192-0035 THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR YOU PUTTING ON AIRS YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT THE ONLY SLAVE THAT HAS BEEN SOLD FROM HIS FAMILY AND YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS HAD TO PART THERE ARE PLENTY MORE MEN ABOUT HERE AND IF YOU WANT A HUSBAND SO BADLY
6032-58192-0036 STOP YOUR CRYING AND GO AND FIND ANOTHER TO THESE UNFEELING WORDS MY MOTHER MADE NO REPLY SHE TURNED AWAY IN STOICAL SILENCE
6032-58192-0037 WITH A CURL OF THAT LOATHING SCORN UPON HER LIPS WHICH SWELLED IN HER HEART MY FATHER AND MOTHER NEVER MET AGAIN IN THIS WORLD THEY KEPT UP A REGULAR CORRESPONDENCE FOR YEARS
6032-58192-0038 AND THE MOST PRECIOUS MEMENTOES OF MY EXISTENCE ARE THE FADED OLD LETTERS THAT HE WROTE FULL OF LOVE AND ALWAYS HOPING THAT THE FUTURE WOULD BRING BRIGHTER DAYS
6032-58192-0039 AND TELL HER THAT I WILL COME TO SEE HER SOME DAY THUS HE WROTE TIME AND AGAIN BUT HE NEVER CAME HE LIVED IN HOPE

6032-58192-0049 GEORGE PLEASANT HOBBS A SERVANT OF GRUM THE LAST LETTER THAT MY MOTHER RECEIVED FROM MY FATHER WAS DATED SHELBYVILLE TENNESSEE MARCH TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
6032-58192-0050 BUT THE HOPE WAS ONLY REALIZED BEYOND THE DARK PORTALS OF THE GRAVE WHEN I WAS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD I WITNESSED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SALE OF A HUMAN BEING
6032-58192-0051 WE WERE LIVING AT PRINCE EDWARD IN VIRGINIA AND MASTER HAD JUST PURCHASED HIS HOGS FOR THE WINTER FOR WHICH HE WAS UNABLE TO PAY IN FULL
6032-58192-0052 TO ESCAPE FROM HIS EMBARRASSMENT IT WAS NECESSARY TO SELL ONE OF THE SLAVES LITTLE JOE THE SON OF THE COOK WAS SELECTED AS THE VICTIM HIS MOTHER WAS ORDERED TO DRESS HIM UP IN HIS SUNDAY CLOTHES
6032-58192-0053 HE CAME IN WITH A BRIGHT FACE WAS PLACED IN THE SCALES AND WAS SOLD LIKE THE HOGS AT SO MUCH PER POUND HIS MOTHER WAS KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF THE TRANSACTION
6032-58192-0054 BUT HER SUSPICIONS WERE AROUSED WHEN HER SON STARTED FOR PETERSBURGH IN THE WAGON THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HER MIND AND SHE PLEADED PITEOUSLY THAT HER BOY SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN FROM HER
6032-58192-0055 MORNING AFTER MORNING PASSED AND THE MOTHER WENT DOWN TO THE GRAVE WITHOUT EVER SEEING HER CHILD AGAIN ONE DAY SHE WAS WHIPPED FOR GRIEVING FOR HER LOST BOY
6032-58192-0056 OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY SLAVES ALL OF WHICH WERE SOLD AND IN A MAJORITY OF INSTANCES WIVES WERE SEPARATED FROM HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS SLAVERY IN THE BORDER STATES FORTY YEARS AGO
6032-58192-0057 WAS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO TIME SEEMED TO SOFTEN THE HEARTS OF MASTER AND MISTRESS AND TO INSURE KINDER AND MORE HUMANE TREATMENT TO BONDSMEN AND BONDSWOMEN
6032-58192-0058 WHEN I WAS QUITE A CHILD AN INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH MY MOTHER AFTERWARD IMPRESSED MORE STRONGLY ON MY MIND ONE OF MY UNCLES A SLAVE OF COLONEL BURWELL
6032-58192-0059 LOST A PAIR OF PLOUGHLINES AND WHEN THE LOSS WAS MADE KNOWN THE MASTER GAVE HIM A NEW PAIR AND TOLD HIM THAT IF HE DID NOT TAKE CARE OF THEM HE WOULD PUNISH HIM SEVERELY
6032-58192-0060 AND MY UNCLE HUNG HIMSELF RATHER THAN MEET THE DISPLEASURE OF HIS MASTER
6032-58192-0061 AND ON LOOKING UP INTO THE WILLOW TREE WHICH SHADED THE BUBBLING CRYSTAL STREAM SHE DISCOVERED THE LIFELESS FORM OF HER BROTHER SUSPENDED BENEATH ONE OF THE STRONG BRANCHES
6032-58192-0062 RATHER THAN BE PUNISHED THE WAY COLONEL BURWELL PUNISHED HIS SERVANTS HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE SLAVERY HAD ITS DARK SIDE
