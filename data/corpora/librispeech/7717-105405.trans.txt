7717-105405-0015 NOT A WORD OF THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN HIM AND CHAUVELIN HAD ESCAPED MARGUERITE AND EVERY WORD THEY HAD SPOKEN SEEMED TO STRIKE AT HER HEART WITH TERRIBLE HOPELESSNESS AND DARK FOREBODING SHE HAD COME ALL THIS WAY
7717-105405-0016 AND WITH SUCH HIGH HOPES AND FIRM DETERMINATION TO HELP HER HUSBAND AND SO FAR SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO NOTHING BUT TO WATCH WITH A HEART BREAKING WITH ANGUISH THE MESHES OF THE DEADLY NET CLOSING ROUND THE DARING SCARLET PIMPERNEL
7717-105405-0017 HE COULD NOT NOW ADVANCE MANY STEPS WITHOUT SPYING EYES TO TRACK AND DENOUNCE HIM HER OWN HELPLESSNESS STRUCK HER WITH THE TERRIBLE SENSE OF UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING THE SLIGHTEST USE TO HER HUSBAND HAD BECOME ALMOST NIL
7717-105405-0018 AND HER ONLY HOPE RESTED IN BEING ALLOWED TO SHARE HIS FATE WHATEVER IT MIGHT ULTIMATELY BE FOR THE MOMENT EVEN HER CHANCE OF EVER SEEING THE MAN SHE LOVED AGAIN HAD BECOME A REMOTE ONE
7717-105405-0019 STILL SHE WAS DETERMINED TO KEEP A CLOSE WATCH OVER HIS ENEMY AND A VAGUE HOPE FILLED HER HEART THAT WHILST SHE KEPT CHAUVELIN IN SIGHT PERCY'S FATE MIGHT STILL BE HANGING IN THE BALANCE
7717-105405-0020 DESGAS LEFT CHAUVELIN MOODILY PACING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WHILST HE HIMSELF WAITED OUTSIDE FOR THE RETURN OF THE MAN WHOM HE HAD SENT IN SEARCH OF REUBEN THUS SEVERAL MINUTES WENT BY CHAUVELIN WAS EVIDENTLY DEVOURED WITH IMPATIENCE
7717-105405-0021 APPARENTLY HE TRUSTED NO ONE THIS LAST TRICK PLAYED UPON HIM BY THE DARING SCARLET PIMPERNEL HAD MADE HIM SUDDENLY DOUBTFUL OF SUCCESS UNLESS HE HIMSELF WAS THERE TO WATCH DIRECT AND SUPERINTEND THE CAPTURE OF THIS IMPUDENT ENGLISHMAN
7717-105405-0022 ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LATER DESGAS RETURNED FOLLOWED BY AN ELDERLY JEW IN A DIRTY THREADBARE GABERDINE WORN GREASY ACROSS THE SHOULDERS HIS RED HAIR WHICH HE WORE AFTER THE FASHION OF THE POLISH JEWS WITH THE CORKSCREW CURLS EACH SIDE OF HIS FACE
