2405-148581-0000 THE MEANS OF RAISING THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAME DURING THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THE ANXIOUS THEME OF ALL RALPH'S THOUGHTS HIS LAWYERS ENQUIRIES SOON BROUGHT THE CONFIRMATION OF CLARE'S SURMISE
2405-148581-0001 AND IT BECAME CLEAR THAT FOR REASONS SWATHED IN ALL THE INGENUITIES OF LEGAL VERBIAGE
2405-148581-0002 IN RETURN FOR A SUBSTANTIAL CONSIDERATION BE PREVAILED ON TO ADMIT THAT IT WAS FOR HER SON'S ADVANTAGE TO REMAIN WITH HIS FATHER THE DAY THIS ADMISSION WAS COMMUNICATED TO RALPH
2405-148581-0003 HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO CARRY THE NEWS TO HIS COUSIN HIS MOOD WAS ONE OF PURE EXALTATION HE SEEMED TO BE HUGGING HIS BOY TO HIM AS HE WALKED PAUL AND HE WERE TO BELONG TO EACH OTHER FOREVER
2405-148581-0004 NO MYSTERIOUS THREAT OF SEPARATION COULD EVER MENACE THEM AGAIN HE HAD THE BLISSFUL SENSE OF RELIEF THAT THE CHILD HIMSELF MIGHT HAVE HAD ON WAKING OUT OF A FRIGHTENED DREAM AND FINDING THE JOLLY DAYLIGHT IN HIS ROOM
2405-148581-0005 CLARE AT ONCE RENEWED HER ENTREATY TO BE ALLOWED TO AID IN RANSOMING HER LITTLE COUSIN BUT RALPH TRIED TO PUT HER OFF BY EXPLAINING THAT HE MEANT TO LOOK ABOUT LOOK WHERE IN THE DAGONET COFFERS
2405-148581-0006 OH RALPH WHAT'S THE USE OF PRETENDING TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HER IT WAS AMAZING HOW HIS COUSIN SUDDENLY DOMINATED HIM BUT AS YET HE COULDN'T GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THE BARGAIN
2405-148581-0007 THAT THE RECKONING BETWEEN HIMSELF AND UNDINE SHOULD BE SETTLED IN DOLLARS AND CENTS SEEMED THE LAST BITTEREST SATIRE ON HIS DREAMS HE FELT HIMSELF MISERABLY DIMINISHED BY THE SMALLNESS OF WHAT HAD FILLED HIS WORLD
2405-148581-0008 NEVERTHELESS THE LOOKING ABOUT HAD TO BE DONE AND A DAY CAME WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE AT THE DOOR OF ELMER MOFFATT'S OFFICE HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN DRAWN BACK TO MOFFATT
2405-148581-0009 BY THE INSISTENCE WITH WHICH THE LATTER'S NAME HAD LATELY BEEN PUT FORWARD BY THE PRESS IN CONNECTION WITH A REVIVAL OF THE ARARAT INVESTIGATION MOFFATT IT APPEARED HAD BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE WITNESSES FOR THE STATE
2405-148581-0010 HIS RETURN FROM EUROPE HAD BEEN ANXIOUSLY AWAITED HIS UNREADINESS TO TESTIFY CAUSTICALLY CRITICIZED THEN AT LAST HE HAD ARRIVED HAD GONE ON TO WASHINGTON AND HAD APPARENTLY HAD NOTHING TO TELL
2405-148581-0011 RALPH WAS TOO DEEP IN HIS OWN TROUBLES TO WASTE ANY WONDER OVER THIS ANTICLIMAX BUT THE FREQUENT APPEARANCE OF MOFFATT'S NAME IN THE MORNING PAPERS ACTED AS AN UNCONSCIOUS SUGGESTION BESIDES TO WHOM ELSE COULD HE LOOK FOR HELP
2405-148581-0012 THE SUM HIS WIFE DEMANDED COULD BE ACQUIRED ONLY BY A QUICK TURN AND THE FACT THAT RALPH HAD ONCE RENDERED THE SAME KIND OF SERVICE TO MOFFATT MADE IT NATURAL TO APPEAL TO HIM NOW THE MARKET MOREOVER HAPPENED TO BE BOOMING
2405-148581-0013 MIGHT HAVE A GOOD THING UP HIS SLEEVE MOFFATT'S OFFICE HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED SINCE RALPH'S LAST VISIT PAINT VARNISH AND BRASS RAILINGS GAVE AN AIR OF OPULENCE TO THE OUTER PRECINCTS AND THE INNER ROOM
2405-148581-0014 WITH ITS MAHOGANY BOOKCASES CONTAINING MOROCCO BOUND SETS AND ITS WIDE BLUE LEATHER ARM CHAIRS LACKED ONLY A PALM OR TWO TO RESEMBLE THE LOUNGE OF A FASHIONABLE HOTEL MOFFATT HIMSELF AS HE CAME FORWARD
2405-148581-0015 GAVE RALPH THE IMPRESSION OF HAVING BEEN DONE OVER BY THE SAME HAND HE WAS SMOOTHER BROADER MORE SUPREMELY TAILORED AND HIS WHOLE PERSON EXHALED THE FAINTEST WHIFF OF AN EXPENSIVE SCENT
2405-148581-0016 HE INSTALLED HIS VISITOR IN ONE OF THE BLUE ARM CHAIRS AND SITTING OPPOSITE AN ELBOW ON HIS IMPRESSIVE WASHINGTON DESK LISTENED ATTENTIVELY WHILE RALPH MADE HIS REQUEST
2405-148581-0017 MOFFATT TWISTED HIS MOUSTACHE BETWEEN TWO PLUMP SQUARE TIPPED FINGERS WITH A LITTLE BLACK GROWTH ON THEIR LOWER JOINTS I DON'T SUPPOSE HE REMARKED THERE'S A SANE MAN BETWEEN HERE AND SAN FRANCISCO WHO ISN'T CONSUMED BY THAT YEARNING
2405-148581-0018 HAVING PERMITTED HIMSELF THIS PLEASANTRY HE PASSED ON TO BUSINESS YES IT'S A FIRST RATE TIME TO BUY NO DOUBT OF THAT
2405-148581-0019 HEARD OF A SOFT THING THAT WON'T WAIT I PRESUME
2405-148581-0020 ALL KINDS OF EM THERE'S ALWAYS OTHER FELLOWS AFTER THEM MOFFATT'S SMILE WAS PLAYFUL WELL I'D GO CONSIDERABLY OUT OF MY WAY TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN BECAUSE YOU DID ME ONE WHEN I NEEDED IT MIGHTY BAD
2405-148581-0021 IN YOUTH YOU SHELTERED ME YES SIR THAT'S THE KIND I AM HE STOOD UP SAUNTERED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AND TOOK A SMALL OBJECT FROM THE TOP OF THE BOOKCASE FOND OF THESE PINK CRYSTALS
2405-148581-0022 HE HELD THE ORIENTAL TOY AGAINST THE LIGHT OH I AIN'T A JUDGE BUT NOW AND THEN I LIKE TO PICK UP A PRETTY THING RALPH NOTICED THAT HIS EYES CARESSED IT WELL NOW LET'S TALK
2405-148581-0023 YOU SAY YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE FUNDS FOR YOUR YOUR INVESTMENT WITHIN THREE WEEKS THAT'S QUICK WORK AND YOU WANT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CAN YOU PUT UP FIFTY RALPH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE QUESTION BUT WHEN IT CAME
2405-148581-0024 HE FELT A MOMENT'S TREMOR HE KNEW HE COULD COUNT ON HALF THE AMOUNT FROM HIS GRANDFATHER
2405-148581-0025 BUT WHAT OF THE REST WELL THERE WAS CLARE
2405-148581-0026 AND AFTER ALL THE MONEY WAS CLARE'S IT WAS DAGONET MONEY AT LEAST SHE SAID IT WAS ALL THE MISERY OF HIS PREDICAMENT WAS DISTILLED INTO THE SHORT SILENCE THAT PRECEDED HIS ANSWER YES
2405-148581-0027 I THINK SO WELL I GUESS I CAN DOUBLE IT FOR YOU MOFFATT SPOKE WITH AN AIR OF OLYMPIAN MODESTY ANYHOW I'LL TRY ONLY DON'T TELL THE OTHER GIRLS
2405-148581-0028 THERE BROKE THE SHOUT OF A SMALL BOY RACING ACROSS A SUBURBAN LAWN WHEN I PICK HIM UP TO NIGHT HE'LL BE MINE FOR GOOD RALPH THOUGHT AS MOFFATT SUMMED UP THERE'S THE WHOLE SCHEME IN A NUT SHELL
2405-148581-0029 OH IF YOU'RE SURE RALPH WAS ALREADY CALCULATING THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO DASH UP TO CLARE VAN DEGEN'S ON HIS WAY TO CATCH THE TRAIN FOR THE FAIRFORDS HIS IMPATIENCE MADE IT HARD TO PAY DUE REGARD TO MOFFATT'S PARTING CIVILITIES
2405-148581-0030 GLAD TO HAVE SEEN YOU HE HEARD THE LATTER ASSURING HIM WITH A FINAL HAND GRASP WISH YOU'D DINE WITH ME SOME EVENING AT MY CLUB AND AS RALPH MURMURED A VAGUE ACCEPTANCE HOW'S THAT BOY OF YOURS BY THE WAY MOFFATT CONTINUED
2405-148581-0031 BUT I UNDERSTOOD YOU KEPT HIM WITH YOU YES THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT WELL SO LONG CLARE'S INNER SITTING ROOM WAS EMPTY BUT THE SERVANT PRESENTLY RETURNING
2405-148581-0032 LED RALPH INTO THE GILDED AND TAPESTRIED WILDERNESS WHERE SHE OCCASIONALLY CHOSE TO RECEIVE HER VISITORS THERE UNDER POPPLE'S EFFIGY OF HERSELF SHE SAT SMALL AND ALONE ON A MONUMENTAL SOFA
2405-148581-0033 BEHIND A TEA TABLE LADEN WITH GOLD PLATE WHILE FROM HIS LOFTY FRAME ON THE OPPOSITE WALL
2405-148581-0034 PORTRAYED BY A POWERFUL ARTIST CAST ON HER THE SATISFIED EYE OF PROPRIETORSHIP RALPH SWEPT FORWARD ON THE BLAST OF HIS EXCITEMENT FELT AS IN A DREAM THE FRIVOLOUS PERVERSITY OF HER RECEIVING HIM IN SUCH A SETTING
2405-148581-0035 INSTEAD OF IN THEIR USUAL QUIET CORNER BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM IN HIS MIND FOR ANYTHING BUT THE CRY THAT BROKE FROM HIM I BELIEVE I'VE DONE IT HE SAT DOWN AND EXPLAINED TO HER BY WHAT MEANS TRYING AS BEST HE COULD
2405-148581-0036 I UNDERSTAND HE'S IN WITH ROLLIVER NOW AND ROLLIVER PRACTICALLY CONTROLS APEX THIS IS SOME KIND OF A SCHEME TO BUY UP ALL THE WORKS OF PUBLIC UTILITY AT APEX THEY'RE PRACTICALLY SURE OF THEIR CHARTER
