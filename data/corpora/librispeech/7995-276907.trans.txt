7995-276907-0000 CHAPTER FIVE CONTAINING CERTAIN ADVENTURES WHICH BEFEL MISTER BOOTH IN THE PRISON THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY MISTER BOOTH SPENT IN MELANCHOLY CONTEMPLATION ON HIS PRESENT CONDITION
7995-276907-0001 GRIEF FOR SOME TIME BANISHED THE THOUGHTS OF FOOD FROM HIS MIND BUT IN THE MORNING NATURE BEGAN TO GROW UNEASY FOR WANT OF HER USUAL NOURISHMENT FOR HE HAD NOT EAT A MORSEL DURING THE LAST FORTY HOURS
7995-276907-0002 A PENNY LOAF WHICH IS IT SEEMS THE ORDINARY ALLOWANCE TO THE PRISONERS IN BRIDEWELL WAS NOW DELIVERED HIM AND WHILE HE WAS EATING THIS A MAN BROUGHT HIM A LITTLE PACKET SEALED UP
7995-276907-0003 INFORMING HIM THAT IT CAME BY A MESSENGER WHO SAID IT REQUIRED NO ANSWER MISTER BOOTH NOW OPENED HIS PACKET AND AFTER UNFOLDING SEVERAL PIECES OF BLANK PAPER SUCCESSIVELY AT LAST
7995-276907-0004 AND NOT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AS HE WAS APPRIZED KNEW OF HIS CONFINEMENT AS THERE WAS NO DIRECTION TO THE PACKET NOR A WORD OF WRITING CONTAINED IN IT HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT IT WAS DELIVERED TO THE WRONG PERSON
7995-276907-0005 THAT HE HAD MADE NO MISTAKE SAYING IF YOUR NAME IS BOOTH SIR I AM POSITIVE YOU ARE THE GENTLEMAN TO WHOM THE PARCEL I GAVE YOU BELONGS
7995-276907-0006 THE MOST SCRUPULOUS HONESTY WOULD PERHAPS IN SUCH A SITUATION HAVE BEEN WELL ENOUGH SATISFIED IN FINDING NO OWNER FOR THE GUINEA ESPECIALLY WHEN PROCLAMATION HAD BEEN MADE IN THE PRISON
7995-276907-0007 THAT MISTER BOOTH HAD RECEIVED A PACKET WITHOUT ANY DIRECTION TO WHICH IF ANY PERSON HAD ANY CLAIM AND WOULD DISCOVER THE CONTENTS HE WAS READY TO DELIVER IT TO SUCH CLAIMANT NO SUCH CLAIMANT BEING FOUND
7995-276907-0008 I MEAN NONE WHO KNEW THE CONTENTS FOR MANY SWORE THAT THEY EXPECTED JUST SUCH A PACKET AND BELIEVED IT TO BE THEIR PROPERTY MISTER BOOTH VERY CALMLY RESOLVED TO APPLY THE MONEY TO HIS OWN USE
7995-276907-0009 THE FIRST THING AFTER REDEMPTION OF THE COAT WHICH MISTER BOOTH HUNGRY AS HE WAS THOUGHT OF WAS TO SUPPLY HIMSELF WITH SNUFF WHICH HE HAD LONG TO HIS GREAT SORROW BEEN WITHOUT ON THIS OCCASION HE PRESENTLY MISSED THAT IRON BOX
7995-276907-0010 WHICH THE METHODIST HAD SO DEXTEROUSLY CONVEYED OUT OF HIS POCKET AS WE MENTIONED IN THE LAST CHAPTER HE NO SOONER MISSED THIS BOX THAN HE IMMEDIATELY SUSPECTED THAT THE GAMBLER WAS THE PERSON WHO HAD STOLEN IT
7995-276907-0011 YET WAS HE RATHER OVERWARM HAVING THEREFORE NO DOUBT CONCERNING THE PERSON OF THE THIEF HE EAGERLY SOUGHT HIM OUT AND VERY BLUNTLY CHARGED HIM WITH THE FACT THE GAMBLER
7995-276907-0012 LOOK AT MY APPAREL FRIEND DO THIEVES AND GAMESTERS WEAR SUCH CLOATHS AS THESE PLAY IS MY FOLLY NOT MY VICE IT IS MY IMPULSE AND I HAVE BEEN A MARTYR TO IT
7995-276907-0013 AND IN THAT ONE THERE IS THE EIGHTEEN PENCE I TOLD YOU OF HE THEN TURNED UP HIS CLOATHS AND HIS POCKETS ENTIRELY RESEMBLED THE PITCHERS OF THE BELIDES BOOTH WAS A LITTLE STAGGERED AT THIS DEFENCE
7995-276907-0014 HE SAID THE REAL VALUE OF THE IRON BOX WAS TOO INCONSIDERABLE TO MENTION BUT THAT HE HAD A CAPRICIOUS VALUE FOR IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE PERSON WHO GAVE IT HIM FOR THOUGH IT IS NOT SAID HE WORTH SIXPENCE
7995-276907-0015 I WOULD WILLINGLY GIVE A CROWN TO ANY ONE WHO WOULD BRING IT ME AGAIN ROBINSON ANSWERED IF THAT BE THE CASE YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO BUT TO SIGNIFY YOUR INTENTION IN THE PRISON AND I AM WELL CONVINCED
7995-276907-0016 YOU WILL NOT BE LONG WITHOUT REGAINING THE POSSESSION OF YOUR SNUFF BOX THIS ADVICE WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED AND WITH SUCCESS THE METHODIST PRESENTLY PRODUCING THE BOX WHICH HE SAID HE HAD FOUND AND SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT BEFORE
7995-276907-0017 WHY SO FRIEND SAID ROBINSON HAVE I NOT HEARD YOU OFTEN SAY THE WICKEDER ANY MAN WAS THE BETTER PROVIDED HE WAS WHAT YOU CALL A BELIEVER YOU MISTAKE ME CRIES COOPER FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE METHODIST
7995-276907-0018 NO MAN CAN BE WICKED AFTER HE IS POSSESSED BY THE SPIRIT THERE IS A WIDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DAYS OF SIN AND THE DAYS OF GRACE I HAVE BEEN A SINNER MYSELF
7995-276907-0019 I CARE NOT ANSWERED THE OTHER WHAT AN ATHEIST BELIEVES I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD INSINUATE THAT I STOLE THE SNUFF BOX BUT I VALUE NOT YOUR MALICE THE LORD KNOWS MY INNOCENCE
7995-276907-0020 HE THEN WALKED OFF WITH THE REWARD AND BOOTH TURNING TO ROBINSON VERY EARNESTLY ASKED PARDON FOR HIS GROUNDLESS SUSPICION WHICH THE OTHER WITHOUT ANY HESITATION ACCORDED HIM SAYING
7995-276907-0021 BUT I HAVE NO REASON TO BE OFFENDED WITH YOU FOR BELIEVING WHAT THE WOMAN AND THE RASCAL WHO IS JUST GONE
7995-276907-0022 WHICH YOU DID NOT PERHAPS KNOW TOLD YOU TO MY DISADVANTAGE AND IF YOU THOUGHT ME TO BE A GAMBLER YOU HAD JUST REASON TO SUSPECT ANY ILL OF ME FOR I MYSELF AM CONFINED HERE BY THE PERJURY OF ONE OF THOSE VILLAINS
7995-276907-0023 WHO HAVING CHEATED ME OF MY MONEY AT PLAY AND HEARING THAT I INTENDED TO APPLY TO A MAGISTRATE AGAINST HIM HIMSELF BEGAN THE ATTACK AND OBTAINED A WARRANT AGAINST ME OF JUSTICE THRASHER
7995-276907-0024 IN THE AFTERNOON BOOTH INDULGED HIS FRIEND WITH A GAME AT CARDS AT FIRST FOR HALFPENCE AND AFTERWARDS FOR SHILLINGS WHEN FORTUNE SO FAVOURED ROBINSON THAT HE DID NOT LEAVE THE OTHER A SINGLE SHILLING IN HIS POCKET
7995-276907-0025 A SURPRIZING RUN OF LUCK IN A GAMESTER IS OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR SOMEWHAT ELSE BY PERSONS WHO ARE NOT OVER ZEALOUS BELIEVERS IN THE DIVINITY OF FORTUNE
7995-276907-0026 WHO HATH HAPPENED FORTUNATELY I MIGHT ALMOST SAY UNFORTUNATELY TO HAVE FOUR BY HONOURS IN HIS HAND ALMOST EVERY TIME HE DEALT FOR A WHOLE EVENING SHUNNED UNIVERSALLY BY THE WHOLE COMPANY THE NEXT DAY
7995-276907-0027 AND CERTAIN IT IS THAT MISTER BOOTH THOUGH OF A TEMPER VERY LITTLE INCLINED TO SUSPICION BEGAN TO WAVER IN HIS OPINION WHETHER THE CHARACTER GIVEN BY MISTER ROBINSON OF HIMSELF
7995-276907-0028 OR THAT WHICH THE OTHERS GAVE OF HIM WAS THE TRUER IN THE MORNING HUNGER PAID HIM A SECOND VISIT AND FOUND HIM AGAIN IN THE SAME SITUATION AS BEFORE AFTER SOME DELIBERATION THEREFORE
7995-276907-0029 HE RESOLVED TO ASK ROBINSON TO LEND HIM A SHILLING OR TWO OF THAT MONEY WHICH WAS LATELY HIS OWN AND THIS EXPERIMENTS HE THOUGHT WOULD CONFIRM HIM EITHER IN A GOOD OR EVIL OPINION OF THAT GENTLEMAN
7995-276907-0030 TO THIS DEMAND ROBINSON ANSWERED WITH GREAT ALACRITY THAT HE SHOULD VERY GLADLY HAVE COMPLIED HAD NOT FORTUNE PLAYED ONE OF HER JADE TRICKS WITH HIM FOR SINCE MY WINNING OF YOU SAID HE I HAVE BEEN STRIPT
7995-276907-0031 NOT ONLY OF YOUR MONEY BUT MY OWN HE WAS GOING TO HARANGUE FARTHER BUT BOOTH WITH GREAT INDIGNATION TURNED FROM HIM THIS POOR GENTLEMAN HAD VERY LITTLE TIME TO REFLECT ON HIS OWN MISERY
7995-276907-0032 OR THE RASCALITY AS IT APPEARED TO HIM OF THE OTHER WHEN THE SAME PERSON WHO HAD THE DAY BEFORE DELIVERED HIM THE GUINEA FROM THE UNKNOWN HAND AGAIN ACCOSTED HIM AND TOLD HIM A LADY IN THE HOUSE SO HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF
7995-276907-0033 DESIRED THE FAVOUR OF HIS COMPANY MISTER BOOTH IMMEDIATELY OBEYED THE MESSAGE AND WAS CONDUCTED INTO A ROOM IN THE PRISON WHERE HE WAS PRESENTLY CONVINCED THAT MISSUS VINCENT WAS NO OTHER THAN HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE
