6211-66279-0000 IT WAS SCARCE AN HOUR AFTER THIS THAT THE FOOTMEN OF THIODOLF CAME OUT OF THE THICKET ROAD ON TO THE MEADOW OF THE BEARINGS THERE SAW THEY MEN GATHERED ON A RISING GROUND
6211-66279-0001 AND THEY CAME UP TO THEM AND SAW HOW SOME OF THEM WERE LOOKING WITH TROUBLED FACES TOWARDS THE FORD AND WHAT LAY BEYOND IT AND SOME TOWARD THE WOOD AND THE COMING OF THIODOLF
6211-66279-0002 THE FIRST TOLD HOW OTTER HAD BEEN COMPELLED IN A MANNER TO FALL ON THE ROMANS ALONG WITH THE RIDERS OF THE BEARINGS AND THE WORMINGS AND THE SECOND WHO HAD BUT JUST THEN COME TOLD HOW THE MARKMEN HAD BEEN WORSTED BY THE ROMANS
6211-66279-0003 BUT LED THE WHOLE HOST STRAIGHTWAY DOWN TO THE FORD LEST THE REMNANT OF OTTER'S MEN SHOULD BE DRIVEN DOWN THERE AND THE ROMANS SHOULD HOLD THE WESTERN BANK AGAINST HIM AT THE FORD THERE WAS NONE TO WITHSTAND THEM
6211-66279-0004 NOR INDEED ANY MAN AT ALL FOR THE MEN WHOM OTTER HAD SET THERE WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THE BATTLE HAD GONE AGAINST THEIR KINDRED HAD RIDDEN THEIR WAYS TO JOIN THEM
6211-66279-0005 HE AND HIS IN GOOD ORDER ALL AFOOT HE LIKE TO THE OTHERS BUT FOR HIM HE WAS CLAD IN THE DWARF WROUGHT HAUBERK BUT WAS UNHELMETED AND BARE NO SHIELD
6211-66279-0006 BUT HE DID NOT LOOK AS JOYOUS AS HIS WONT WAS IN GOING DOWN TO THE BATTLE NOW THEY HAD GONE BUT A SHORT WAY FROM THE FORD BEFORE THE NOISE OF THE FIGHT AND THE BLOWING OF HORNS CAME DOWN THE WIND TO THEM
6211-66279-0007 BUT IT WAS A LITTLE WAY FURTHER BEFORE THEY SAW THE FRAY WITH THEIR EYES BECAUSE THE GROUND FELL AWAY FROM THE RIVER SOMEWHAT AT FIRST
6211-66279-0008 BUT WHEN THEY WERE COME TO THE TOP OF THE NEXT SWELLING OF THE GROUND THEY BEHELD FROM THENCE WHAT THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH FOR THERE ROUND ABOUT A GROUND OF VANTAGE WAS THE FIELD BLACK WITH THE ROMAN HOST
6211-66279-0009 AND IN THE MIDST OF IT WAS A TANGLE OF STRUGGLING MEN AND TOSSING SPEARS AND GLITTERING SWORDS SO WHEN THEY BEHELD THE BATTLE OF THEIR KINDRED THEY GAVE A GREAT SHOUT AND HASTENED ONWARD THE FASTER
6211-66279-0010 AND NOW EVEN AS THEY WHO WERE ON THE OUTWARD EDGE OF THE ARRAY AND COULD SEE WHAT WAS TOWARD WERE LOOKING ON THE BATTLE WITH EAGER EYES THERE CAME AN ANSWERING SHOUT DOWN THE WIND WHICH THEY KNEW FOR THE VOICE OF THE GOTHS AMID THE FOEMEN
6211-66279-0011 AND THEN THEY SAW HOW THE RING OF THE ROMANS SHOOK AND PARTED AND THEIR ARRAY FELL BACK AND LO THE COMPANY OF THE MARKMEN STANDING STOUTLY TOGETHER THOUGH SORELY MINISHED AND SURE IT WAS THAT THEY HAD NOT FLED OR BEEN SCATTERED
6211-66279-0012 IN ONE BAND FOR THERE WERE NO MEN STRAGGLING TOWARDS THE FORD THOUGH MANY MASTERLESS HORSES RAN HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE MEADOW NOW THEREFORE NONE DOUBTED BUT THAT THEY WOULD DELIVER THEIR FRIENDS FROM THE ROMANS AND OVERTHROW THE FOEMEN
6211-66279-0013 BUT NOW BEFEL A WONDER A STRANGE THING TO TELL OF THE ROMANS SOON PERCEIVED WHAT WAS ADOING WHEREUPON THE HALF OF THEM TURNED ABOUT TO FACE THE NEW COMERS WHILE THE OTHER HALF STILL WITHSTOOD THE COMPANY OF OTTER
6211-66279-0014 TILL IT WAS HARD ON THE PLACE WHERE IT SHOULD SPREAD ITSELF OUT TO STORM DOWN ON THE FOE AND THE GOTHS BESET BY THE ROMANS MADE THEM READY TO FALL ON FROM THEIR SIDE
6211-66279-0015 AND ALL MEN LOOKING FOR THE TOKEN AND SIGN TO FALL ON BUT EVEN AS HE LIFTED UP THRONG PLOUGH TO GIVE THAT SIGN A CLOUD CAME OVER HIS EYES AND HE SAW NOUGHT OF ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HIM AND HE STAGGERED BACK AS ONE WHO HATH GOTTEN A DEADLY STROKE
6211-66279-0016 AND SO FELL SWOONING TO THE EARTH THOUGH NONE HAD SMITTEN HIM THEN STAYED WAS THE WEDGE ARRAY EVEN AT THE VERY POINT OF ONSET AND THE HEARTS OF THE GOTHS SANK FOR THEY DEEMED THAT THEIR LEADER WAS SLAIN
6211-66279-0017 AND THOSE WHO WERE NEAREST TO HIM RAISED HIM UP AND BORE HIM HASTILY ABACK OUT OF THE BATTLE AND THE ROMANS ALSO HAD BEHELD HIM FALL AND THEY ALSO DEEMED HIM DEAD OR SORE HURT AND SHOUTED FOR JOY AND LOITERED NOT
6211-66279-0018 BUT STORMED FORTH ON THE WEDGE ARRAY LIKE VALIANT MEN FOR IT MUST BE TOLD THAT THEY WHO ERST OUT NUMBERED THE COMPANY OF OTTER WERE NOW MUCH OUT NUMBERED BUT THEY DEEMED IT MIGHT WELL BE THAT THEY COULD DISMAY THE GOTHS SINCE THEY HAD BEEN STAYED BY THE FALL OF THEIR LEADER
6211-66279-0019 AND OTTER'S COMPANY WERE WEARIED WITH SORE FIGHTING AGAINST A GREAT HOST NEVERTHELESS THESE LAST
6211-66279-0020 FELL ON WITH SUCH EXCEEDING FURY THAT THEY DROVE THE ROMANS WHO FACED THEM BACK ON THOSE WHO HAD SET ON THE WEDGE ARRAY WHICH ALSO STOOD FAST UNDISMAYED FOR HE WHO STOOD NEXT TO THIODOLF A MAN BIG OF BODY AND STOUT OF HEART
6211-66279-0021 BUT THERE WAS NO OTTER THERE AND MANY ANOTHER MAN WAS GONE
6211-66279-0022 THESE STORMED ON SO FIERCELY THAT THEY CLEFT THEIR WAY THROUGH ALL AND JOINED THEMSELVES TO THEIR KINDRED AND THE BATTLE WAS RENEWED IN THE WOLFING MEADOW BUT THE ROMANS HAD THIS GAIN
6211-66279-0023 THAT THIODOLF'S MEN HAD LET GO THEIR OCCASION FOR FALLING ON THE ROMANS WITH THEIR LINE SPREAD OUT SO THAT EVERY MAN MIGHT USE HIS WEAPONS YET WERE THE GOTHS STRONG BOTH IN VALIANCY AND IN NUMBERS NOR MIGHT THE ROMANS BREAK INTO THEIR ARRAY
6211-66279-0024 AND SWEINBIORN OF THE BEARINGS THAT THEY SEEMED TO THE ROMANS BUT A FEEBLE BAND EASY TO OVERCOME SO FOUGHT THEY IN THE WOLFING MEADOW IN THE FIFTH HOUR AFTER HIGH NOON AND NEITHER YIELDED TO THE OTHER
6211-66279-0025 ROUND WHOSE BOLE CLUNG FLOCKS OF WOOL FROM THE SHEEP THAT DREW AROUND IT IN THE HOT SUMMER TIDE AND RUBBED THEMSELVES AGAINST IT AND THE GROUND WAS TRODDEN BARE OF GRASS ROUND THE BOLE AND CLOSE TO THE TRUNK WAS WORN INTO A KIND OF TRENCH
6211-66279-0026 AND THEY WONDERED THAT NO BLOOD CAME FROM HIM
6211-66279-0027 SWIMMING IN THE RIVER GOING A HUNTING WITH THE ELDER CARLES AND ESPECIALLY HE DEEMED THAT HE WAS IN THE COMPANY OF ONE OLD MAN WHO HAD TAUGHT HIM BOTH WOOD CRAFT AND THE HANDLING OF WEAPONS AND FAIR AT FIRST WAS HIS DREAM OF HIS DOINGS WITH THIS MAN
6211-66279-0028 AND TELLING THIODOLF IN WHAT WISE IT WAS BEST TO GO ABOUT TO GET THE WIND OF A HART BUT ALL THE WHILE THERE WAS GOING ON THE THUNDER OF A GREAT GALE OF WIND THROUGH THE WOODLAND BOUGHS EVEN AS THE DRONE OF A BAG PIPE CLEAVES TO THE TUNE
6211-66279-0029 THOUGH THE WIND STIRRED HIS HAIR AND HIS RAIMENT AS THEY DID BEFORE THEREWITH A GREAT PANG SMOTE THIODOLF IN HIS DREAM
6211-66279-0030 AND HE STROVE AND STRUGGLED AND LO THE WILD WOOD WAS GONE AND A WHITE LIGHT EMPTY OF ALL VISION WAS BEFORE HIM AND AS HE MOVED HIS HEAD THIS BECAME THE WOLFING MEADOW AS HE HAD KNOWN IT SO LONG AND THEREAT A SOFT PLEASURE AND JOY TOOK HOLD OF HIM
6211-66279-0031 SO HE STOOD UP AND LOOKED ABOUT AND AROUND HIM WAS A RING OF THE SORROWFUL FACES OF THE WARRIORS WHO HAD DEEMED THAT HE WAS HURT DEADLY THOUGH NO HURT COULD THEY FIND UPON HIM
6211-66279-0032 BUT THE DWARF WROUGHT HAUBERK LAY UPON THE GROUND BESIDE HIM FOR THEY HAD TAKEN IT OFF HIM TO LOOK FOR HIS HURTS SO HE LOOKED INTO THEIR FACES AND SAID WHAT AILETH YOU YE MEN I AM ALIVE AND UNHURT WHAT HATH BETIDED
6211-66279-0033 AND ONE SAID ART THOU VERILY ALIVE OR A MAN COME BACK FROM THE DEAD WE SAW THEE FALL AS THOU WENTEST LEADING US AGAINST THE FOE AS IF THOU HADST BEEN SMITTEN BY A THUNDER BOLT AND WE DEEMED THEE DEAD OR GRIEVOUSLY HURT
6211-66279-0034 SAID AN OLD WARRIOR IF THAT BE SO THIODOLF WILT THOU BLENCH TWICE IS NOT ONCE ENOUGH NOW LET US GO BACK TO THE HARD HANDPLAY AND IF THOU WILT SMITE THYSELF AFTER THE BATTLE WHEN WE HAVE ONCE MORE HAD A MAN'S HELP OF THEE
6211-66279-0035 THEREWITH HE HELD OUT THRONG PLOUGH TO HIM BY THE POINT
6211-66279-0036 LET US HASTEN WHILE THE GODS WILL HAVE IT SO AND WHILE THEY ARE STILL SUFFERING ME TO STRIKE A STROKE FOR THE KINDRED AND THEREWITH HE BRANDISHED THRONG PLOUGH AND WENT FORTH TOWARD THE BATTLE AND THE HEART GREW HOT WITHIN HIM
6211-66279-0037 AND THE JOY OF WAKING LIFE CAME BACK TO HIM THE JOY WHICH BUT EREWHILE HE HAD GIVEN TO A MERE DREAM BUT THE OLD MAN WHO HAD REBUKED HIM STOOPED DOWN AND LIFTED THE HAUBERK FROM THE GROUND AND CRIED OUT AFTER HIM
6211-66279-0038 THE ROMANS GIVING BACK BEFORE THE GOTHS AND THE GOTHS FOLLOWING UP THE CHASE BUT SLOWLY AND STEADILY THEN THIODOLF HEEDED NOTHING SAVE THE BATTLE BUT RAN FORWARD HASTILY
6211-66279-0039 AND THOSE WARRIORS FOLLOWED HIM THE OLD MAN LAST OF ALL HOLDING THE HAUBERK IN HIS HAND AND MUTTERING SO FARES HOT BLOOD TO THE GLOOMING AND THE WORLD BENEATH THE GRASS AND THE FRUIT OF THE WOLFINGS ORCHARD IN A FLASH FROM THE WORLD MUST PASS
