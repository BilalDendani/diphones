4010-10798-0000 THE HEART WITH THE TREASURE
4010-10798-0001 LAY NOT UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES UPON EARTH WHERE MOTH AND RUST DOTH CORRUPT AND WHERE THIEVES BREAK THROUGH AND STEAL BUT LAY UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES IN HEAVEN WHERE NEITHER MOTH NOR RUST DOTH CORRUPT
4010-10798-0002 AND WHERE THIEVES DO NOT BREAK THROUGH NOR STEAL FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO
4010-10798-0003 TO UNDERSTAND THE WORDS OF OUR LORD IS THE BUSINESS OF LIFE FOR IT IS THE MAIN ROAD TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD HIMSELF AND TO RECEIVE HIM
4010-10798-0004 IS TO RECEIVE THE FATHER AND SO TO HAVE LIFE IN OURSELVES AND LIFE THE HIGHER THE DEEPER THE SIMPLER
4010-10798-0005 IS THE BUSINESS OF LIFE THE WORD IS THAT BY WHICH WE LIVE NAMELY JESUS HIMSELF
4010-10798-0006 IN SHADOW IN SUGGESTION HIMSELF ANY UTTERANCE WORTHY OF BEING CALLED A TRUTH IS HUMAN FOOD HOW MUCH MORE THE WORD PRESENTING NO ABSTRACT LAWS OF OUR BEING
4010-10798-0007 BUT THE VITAL RELATION OF SOUL AND BODY HEART AND WILL STRENGTH AND REJOICING BEAUTY AND LIGHT TO HIM WHO FIRST GAVE BIRTH TO THEM ALL THE SON CAME FORTH TO BE
4010-10798-0008 BEFORE OUR EYES AND IN OUR HEARTS THAT WHICH HE HAD MADE US FOR THAT WE MIGHT BEHOLD THE TRUTH IN HIM AND CRY OUT FOR THE LIVING GOD WHO IN THE HIGHEST SENSE OF ALL IS THE TRUTH
4010-10798-0009 NOT AS UNDERSTOOD BUT AS UNDERSTANDING LIVING AND BEING DOING AND CREATING THE TRUTH I AM THE TRUTH SAID OUR LORD
4010-10798-0010 AND BY THOSE WHO ARE IN SOME MEASURE LIKE HIM IN BEING THE TRUTH THE WORD CAN BE UNDERSTOOD LET US TRY TO UNDERSTAND HIM SOMETIMES NO DOUBT THE SAVIOUR WOULD HAVE SPOKEN AFTER A DIFFERENT FASHION OF SPEECH
4010-10798-0011 IF HE HAD COME TO ENGLISHMEN INSTEAD OF TO JEWS BUT THE LESSONS HE GAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME FOR EVEN WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT A MATTER FOR ITS PASSING IMPORT HIS REPLY CONTAINED THE ENUNCIATION OF THE GREAT HUMAN PRINCIPLE WHICH LAY IN IT
4010-10798-0012 AND THAT LIES CHANGELESS IN EVERY VARIATION OF CHANGEFUL CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE LIGHT OF ADDED AGES OF CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE IT OUGHT TO BE EASIER FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HIS WORDS
4010-10798-0013 BECAUSE OF ITS DEPTH AT ONCE AND ITS SIMPLICITY BUT IT IS SO COMPLETE SO IMAGINATIVELY COMPREHENSIVE SO IMMEDIATELY OPERATIVE ON THE CONSCIENCE THROUGH ITS POETIC SUGGESTIVENESS
4010-10798-0014 THAT WHEN IT IS ONCE UNDERSTOOD THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID BUT EVERYTHING TO BE DONE WHY NOT LAY UP FOR OURSELVES TREASURES UPON EARTH BECAUSE THERE THE MOTH AND RUST
4010-10798-0015 AND THE THIEF COME AND SO WE SHOULD LOSE THOSE TREASURES YES BY THE MOTH AND THE RUST AND THE THIEF
4010-10798-0016 FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO OF COURSE THE HEART WILL BE WHERE THE TREASURE IS BUT WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH THE ARGUMENT THIS
4010-10798-0017 THAT WHAT IS WITH THE TREASURE MUST FARE AS THE TREASURE THAT THE HEART WHICH HAUNTS THE TREASURE HOUSE WHERE THE MOTH AND RUST CORRUPT WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE SAME RAVAGES AS THE TREASURE
4010-10798-0018 WILL ITSELF BE RUSTED AND MOTH EATEN MANY A MAN MANY A WOMAN FAIR AND FLOURISHING TO SEE IS GOING ABOUT WITH A RUSTY MOTH EATEN HEART WITHIN THAT FORM OF STRENGTH OR BEAUTY
4010-10798-0019 BUT THIS IS ONLY A FIGURE TRUE BUT IS THE REALITY INTENDED LESS OR MORE THAN THE FIGURE DOES NOT THE RUST AND THE MOTH MEAN MORE THAN DISEASE
4010-10798-0020 BUT BLESSEDNESS YEA ECSTASY A HEART WHICH IS THE INMOST CHAMBER WHEREIN SPRINGS THE DIVINE FOUNTAIN OF YOUR BEING A HEART WHICH GOD REGARDS THOUGH YOU MAY NEVER HAVE KNOWN ITS EXISTENCE
4010-10798-0021 NOT EVEN WHEN ITS WRITHINGS UNDER THE GNAWING OF THE MOTH AND THE SLOW FIRE OF THE RUST HAVE COMMUNICATED A DULL PAIN TO THAT OUTER HEART WHICH SENDS THE BLOOD TO ITS APPOINTED COURSE THROUGH YOUR BODY IF GOD SEES THAT HEART CORRODED
4010-10798-0022 WITH THE RUST OF CARES RIDDLED INTO CAVERNS AND FILMS BY THE WORMS OF AMBITION AND GREED THEN YOUR HEART IS AS GOD SEES IT FOR GOD SEES THINGS AS THEY ARE AND ONE DAY
4010-10798-0023 YOU WILL BE COMPELLED TO SEE NAY TO FEEL YOUR HEART AS GOD SEES IT AND TO KNOW THAT THE CANKERED THING WHICH YOU HAVE WITHIN YOU
4010-10798-0024 IS INDEED THE CENTRE OF YOUR BEING YOUR VERY HEART NOR DOES THE LESSON APPLY TO THOSE ONLY WHO WORSHIP MAMMON WHO GIVE THEIR LIVES THEIR BEST ENERGIES TO THE ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH
4010-10798-0025 BY TASTE BY INTELLECT BY POWER BY ART BY GENIUS OF ANY KIND AND SO WOULD GATHER GOLDEN OPINIONS TO BE TREASURED IN A STOREHOUSE OF EARTH NOR TO SUCH ONLY
4010-10798-0026 DO THESE WORDS BEAR TERRIBLE WARNING FOR THE HURT LIES NOT IN THIS THAT THESE PLEASURES ARE FALSE LIKE THE DECEPTIONS OF MAGIC FOR SUCH THEY ARE NOT PLEASURES THEY ARE NOR YET IN THIS
4010-10798-0027 THAT THEY PASS AWAY AND LEAVE A FIERCE DISAPPOINTMENT BEHIND THAT IS ONLY SO MUCH THE BETTER
4010-10798-0028 THAT THE IMMORTAL THE INFINITE CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF THE EVERLASTING GOD IS HOUSED WITH THE FADING AND THE CORRUPTING AND CLINGS TO THEM AS ITS GOOD CLINGS TO THEM
4010-10798-0029 TILL IT IS INFECTED AND INTERPENETRATED WITH THEIR PROPER DISEASES WHICH ASSUME IN IT A FORM MORE TERRIBLE IN PROPORTION TO THE SUPERIORITY OF ITS KIND THAT WHICH IS MERE DECAY IN THE ONE BECOMING MORAL VILENESS IN THE OTHER
4010-10798-0030 THAT WHICH FITS THE ONE FOR THE DUNGHILL
4010-10798-0031 AND STRENGTHENING THEM IN FURTHER AND FURTHER FLIGHTS TILL AT LAST THEY SHOULD BECOME STRONG TO BEAR THE GOD BORN INTO THE PRESENCE OF ITS FATHER IN HEAVEN THEREIN LIES THE HURT
4010-10798-0032 HE WHOSE HEART IS SOUND BECAUSE IT HAUNTS THE TREASURE HOUSE OF HEAVEN MAY BE TEMPTED OF THE DEVIL
