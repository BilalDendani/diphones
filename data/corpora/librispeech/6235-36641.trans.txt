6235-36641-0000 A PEARL WORTH TEN MILLION NIGHT FELL I WENT TO BED I SLEPT PRETTY POORLY MAN EATERS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN MY DREAMS AND I FOUND IT MORE OR LESS APPROPRIATE
6235-36641-0001 HAS ITS LINGUISTIC ROOTS IN THE WORD REQUIEM THE NEXT DAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
6235-36641-0002 I GOT UP QUICKLY DRESSED AND WENT INTO THE LOUNGE CAPTAIN NEMO WAS WAITING FOR ME PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE SAID TO ME ARE YOU READY TO START I'M READY KINDLY FOLLOW ME
6235-36641-0003 WHAT ABOUT MY COMPANIONS CAPTAIN THEY'VE BEEN ALERTED AND ARE WAITING FOR US AREN'T WE GOING TO PUT ON OUR DIVING SUITS I ASKED NOT YET
6235-36641-0004 I HAVEN'T LET THE NAUTILUS PULL TOO NEAR THE COAST AND WE'RE FAIRLY WELL OUT
6235-36641-0005 BUT I HAVE THE SKIFF READY AND IT WILL TAKE US TO THE EXACT SPOT WHERE WE'LL DISEMBARK WHICH WILL SAVE US A PRETTY LONG TREK IT'S CARRYING OUR DIVING EQUIPMENT
6235-36641-0006 CAPTAIN NEMO TOOK ME TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY WHOSE STEPS LED TO THE PLATFORM NED AND CONSEIL WERE THERE
6235-36641-0007 OARS IN POSITION FIVE OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS WERE WAITING FOR US ABOARD THE SKIFF WHICH WAS MOORED ALONGSIDE THE NIGHT WAS STILL DARK LAYERS OF CLOUDS CLOAKED THE SKY AND LEFT ONLY A FEW STARS IN VIEW
6235-36641-0008 COVERING THREE QUARTERS OF THE HORIZON FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHWEST GOING UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST DURING THE NIGHT THE NAUTILUS LAY WEST OF THE BAY
6235-36641-0009 UNDER THESE DARK WATERS THERE STRETCHED THE BANK OF SHELLFISH AN INEXHAUSTIBLE FIELD OF PEARLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILES LONG
6235-36641-0010 FOUND SEATS IN THE STERN OF THE SKIFF THE LONGBOAT'S COXSWAIN TOOK THE TILLER
6235-36641-0011 AND WE PULLED CLEAR THE SKIFF HEADED SOUTHWARD THE OARSMEN TOOK THEIR TIME I WATCHED THEIR STROKES VIGOROUSLY CATCH THE WATER AND THEY ALWAYS WAITED TEN SECONDS BEFORE ROWING AGAIN
6235-36641-0012 FOLLOWING THE PRACTICE USED IN MOST NAVIES WHILE THE LONGBOAT COASTED DROPS OF LIQUID FLICKED FROM THE OARS AND HIT THE DARK TROUGHS OF THE WAVES PITTER PATTERING LIKE SPLASHES OF MOLTEN LEAD
6235-36641-0013 COMING FROM WELL OUT A MILD SWELL MADE THE SKIFF ROLL GENTLY AND A FEW CRESTING BILLOWS LAPPED AT ITS BOW WE WERE SILENT WHAT WAS CAPTAIN NEMO THINKING
6235-36641-0014 CONTRARY TO THE CANADIAN'S VIEWS IN WHICH IT STILL SEEMED TOO FAR AWAY AS FOR CONSEIL HE HAD COME ALONG OUT OF SIMPLE CURIOSITY
6235-36641-0015 DEFINED THE UPPER LINES OF THE COAST WITH GREATER DISTINCTNESS FAIRLY FLAT TO THE EAST IT SWELLED A LITTLE TOWARD THE SOUTH
6235-36641-0016 BETWEEN US AND THE SHORE THE SEA WAS DESERTED NOT A BOAT NOT A DIVER PROFOUND SOLITUDE REIGNED OVER THIS GATHERING PLACE OF PEARL FISHERMEN AS CAPTAIN NEMO HAD COMMENTED
6235-36641-0017 A MONTH TOO SOON AT SIX O'CLOCK THE DAY BROKE SUDDENLY WITH THAT SPEED UNIQUE TO TROPICAL REGIONS
6235-36641-0018 THE SUN'S RAYS PIERCED THE CLOUD CURTAIN GATHERED ON THE EASTERLY HORIZON AND THE RADIANT ORB ROSE SWIFTLY I COULD CLEARLY SEE THE SHORE WHICH FEATURED A FEW SPARSE TREES HERE AND THERE
6235-36641-0019 THE SKIFF ADVANCED TOWARD MANNAR ISLAND WHICH CURVED TO THE SOUTH CAPTAIN NEMO STOOD UP FROM HIS THWART AND STUDIED THE SEA AT HIS SIGNAL THE ANCHOR WAS LOWERED
6235-36641-0020 BUT ITS CHAIN BARELY RAN BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LAY NO MORE THAN A METER DOWN AND THIS LOCALITY WAS ONE OF THE SHALLOWEST SPOTS
6235-36641-0021 YOU OBSERVE THIS CONFINED BAY A MONTH FROM NOW IN THIS VERY PLACE THE NUMEROUS FISHING BOATS OF THE HARVESTERS WILL GATHER AND THESE ARE THE WATERS THEIR DIVERS WILL RANSACK SO DARINGLY THIS
6235-36641-0022 BAY IS FELICITOUSLY LAID OUT FOR THEIR TYPE OF FISHING IT'S SHELTERED FROM THE STRONGEST WINDS AND THE SEA IS NEVER VERY TURBULENT HERE HIGHLY FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR DIVING WORK NOW LET'S PUT ON OUR UNDERWATER SUITS
6235-36641-0023 AND WE'LL BEGIN OUR STROLL I DIDN'T REPLY AND WHILE STARING AT THESE SUSPICIOUS WAVES I BEGAN TO PUT ON MY HEAVY AQUATIC CLOTHES HELPED BY THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS
6235-36641-0024 NONE OF THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE TO GO WITH US ON THIS NEW EXCURSION
6235-36641-0025 AS FOR THE RUHMKORFF DEVICE IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE IN THE PICTURE BEFORE INSERTING MY HEAD INTO ITS COPPER CAPSULE I COMMENTED ON THIS TO THE CAPTAIN OUR LIGHTING EQUIPMENT WOULD BE USELESS TO US THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME
6235-36641-0026 WE WON'T BE GOING VERY DEEP AND THE SUN'S RAYS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO LIGHT OUR WAY BESIDES IT'S UNWISE TO CARRY ELECTRIC LANTERNS UNDER THESE WAVES
6235-36641-0027 THEIR BRIGHTNESS MIGHT UNEXPECTEDLY ATTRACT CERTAIN DANGEROUS OCCUPANTS OF THESE WATERWAYS AS CAPTAIN NEMO PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS I TURNED TO CONSEIL AND NED LAND
6235-36641-0028 BUT MY TWO FRIENDS HAD ALREADY ENCASED THEIR CRANIUMS IN THEIR METAL HEADGEAR AND THEY COULD NEITHER HEAR NOR REPLY
6235-36641-0029 WHAT ABOUT OUR WEAPONS I ASKED HIM OUR RIFLES RIFLES WHAT FOR DON'T YOUR MOUNTAINEERS ATTACK BEARS DAGGER IN HAND AND ISN'T STEEL SURER THAN LEAD HERE'S A STURDY BLADE SLIP IT UNDER YOUR BELT AND LET'S BE OFF
6235-36641-0030 I STARED AT MY COMPANIONS THEY WERE ARMED IN THE SAME FASHION
6235-36641-0031 THEN FOLLOWING THE CAPTAIN'S EXAMPLE I LET MYSELF BE CROWNED WITH MY HEAVY COPPER SPHERE AND OUR AIR TANKS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO ACTION AN INSTANT LATER THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS HELPED US OVERBOARD ONE AFTER THE OTHER
6235-36641-0032 AND WE SET FOOT ON LEVEL SAND IN A METER AND A HALF OF WATER
6235-36641-0033 WE FOLLOWED HIM DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE AND DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WAVES THERE THE OBSESSIVE FEARS IN MY BRAIN LEFT ME I BECAME SURPRISINGLY CALM AGAIN THE EASE WITH WHICH I COULD MOVE INCREASED MY CONFIDENCE
6235-36641-0034 AND THE MANY STRANGE SIGHTS CAPTIVATED MY IMAGINATION THE SUN WAS ALREADY SENDING SUFFICIENT LIGHT UNDER THESE WAVES THE TINIEST OBJECTS REMAINED VISIBLE AFTER TEN MINUTES OF WALKING
6235-36641-0035 WE WERE IN FIVE METERS OF WATER AND THE TERRAIN HAD BECOME ALMOST FLAT
6235-36641-0036 THERE ROSE UNDERFOOT SCHOOLS OF UNUSUAL FISH FROM THE GENUS MONOPTERUS WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE NO FIN
6235-36641-0037 A GENUINE EIGHT DECIMETER SERPENT WITH A BLUISH GRAY BELLY WHICH WITHOUT THE GOLD LINES OVER ITS FLANKS COULD EASILY BE CONFUSED WITH THE CONGER EEL FROM THE BUTTERFISH GENUS WHOSE OVAL BODIES ARE VERY FLAT
6235-36641-0038 EDIBLE FISH THAT WHEN DRIED AND MARINATED MAKE AN EXCELLENT DISH KNOWN BY THE NAME
6235-36641-0039 THEN SOME SEA POACHERS FISH BELONGING TO THE GENUS
6235-36641-0040 WHOSE BODIES ARE COVERED WITH SCALY ARMOR DIVIDED INTO EIGHT LENGTHWISE SECTIONS MEANWHILE AS THE SUN GOT PROGRESSIVELY HIGHER IT LIT UP THE WATERY MASS MORE AND MORE THE SEAFLOOR CHANGED LITTLE BY LITTLE
6235-36641-0041 AMONG OTHER SPECIMENS IN THESE TWO BRANCHES I NOTED SOME WINDOWPANE OYSTERS WITH THIN VALVES OF UNEQUAL SIZE A TYPE OF OSTRACOD
6235-36641-0042 WITH CIRCULAR SHELLS AWL SHAPED AUGER SHELLS
6235-36641-0043 WITH SUCH WONDERFUL DYE SPIKY PERIWINKLES FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS LONG THAT ROSE UNDER THE WAVES LIKE HANDS READY TO GRAB YOU TURBAN SNAILS WITH SHELLS MADE OF HORN
6235-36641-0044 LAMP SHELLS EDIBLE DUCK CLAMS THAT FEED THE HINDU MARKETPLACE SUBTLY LUMINOUS JELLYFISH
6235-36641-0045 AND FINALLY SOME WONDERFUL OCULINA FLABELLIFORMA MAGNIFICENT SEA FANS THAT
6235-36641-0046 IN THE MIDST OF THIS MOVING VEGETATION UNDER ARBORS OF WATER PLANTS THERE RACED LEGIONS OF CLUMSY ARTICULATES IN PARTICULAR SOME FANGED FROG CRABS
6235-36641-0047 SLIGHTLY ROUNDED TRIANGLE ROBBER CRABS EXCLUSIVE TO THESE WATERWAYS AND HORRIBLE PARTHENOPE CRABS WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS REPULSIVE TO THE EYE ONE ANIMAL NO LESS HIDEOUS WHICH I ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL TIMES
6235-36641-0048 HERE UNDER THESE CLEAR WAVES THIS CRAB RACED AROUND WITH MATCHLESS AGILITY WHILE GREEN TURTLES FROM THE SPECIES FREQUENTING THE MALABAR COAST MOVED SLUGGISHLY AMONG THE CRUMBLING ROCKS
6235-36641-0049 NEAR SEVEN O'CLOCK WE FINALLY SURVEYED THE BANK OF SHELLFISH WHERE PEARL OYSTERS REPRODUCE BY THE MILLIONS
6235-36641-0050 THAT WOMB FOR PEARLS WHOSE VALVES ARE NEARLY EQUAL IN SIZE HAS THE SHAPE OF A ROUND SHELL WITH THICK WALLS
6235-36641-0051 SOME OF THESE SHELLS WERE FURROWED WITH FLAKY GREENISH BANDS THAT RADIATED DOWN FROM THE TOP THESE WERE THE YOUNG OYSTERS THE OTHERS HAD RUGGED BLACK SURFACES MEASURED UP TO FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS IN WIDTH
6235-36641-0052 AND WERE TEN OR MORE YEARS OLD
6235-36641-0053 WERE GENUINELY INEXHAUSTIBLE SINCE NATURE'S CREATIVE POWERS ARE GREATER THAN MAN'S DESTRUCTIVE INSTINCTS TRUE TO THOSE INSTINCTS NED LAND GREEDILY STUFFED THE FINEST OF THESE MOLLUSKS
6235-36641-0054 INTO A NET HE CARRIED AT HIS SIDE BUT WE COULDN'T STOP WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN
6235-36641-0055 AND WHEN I LIFTED MY ARMS SOMETIMES THEY WOULD PASS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA THEN THE LEVEL OF THE OYSTERBANK WOULD LOWER UNPREDICTABLY OFTEN WE WENT AROUND TALL POINTED ROCKS RISING LIKE PYRAMIDS
6235-36641-0056 AIMING THEIR LONG LEGS LIKE HEAVY ARTILLERY WATCHED US WITH UNBLINKING EYES WHILE UNDERFOOT THERE CREPT MILLIPEDES BLOODWORMS
6235-36641-0057 WHOSE ANTENNAS AND TUBULAR TENTACLES WERE INCREDIBLY LONG JUST THEN A HUGE CAVE OPENED UP IN OUR PATH HOLLOWED FROM A PICTURESQUE PILE OF ROCKS WHOSE SMOOTH HEIGHTS WERE COMPLETELY HUNG WITH UNDERWATER FLORA
6235-36641-0058 AT FIRST THIS CAVE LOOKED PITCH BLACK TO ME INSIDE THE SUN'S RAYS SEEMED TO DIMINISH BY DEGREES THEIR HAZY TRANSPARENCY WAS NOTHING MORE THAN DROWNED LIGHT CAPTAIN NEMO WENT IN WE FOLLOWED HIM
6235-36641-0059 I DISTINGUISHED THE UNPREDICTABLY CONTOURED SPRINGINGS OF A VAULT SUPPORTED BY NATURAL PILLARS FIRMLY BASED ON A GRANITE FOUNDATION LIKE THE WEIGHTY COLUMNS OF TUSCAN ARCHITECTURE WHY HAD OUR INCOMPREHENSIBLE GUIDE
6235-36641-0060 I WOULD SOON FIND OUT AFTER GOING DOWN A FAIRLY STEEP SLOPE OUR FEET TROD THE FLOOR OF A SORT OF CIRCULAR PIT
6235-36641-0061 A HOLY WATER FONT THAT COULD HAVE HELD A WHOLE LAKE A BASIN MORE THAN TWO METERS WIDE HENCE EVEN BIGGER THAN THE ONE ADORNING THE NAUTILUS'S LOUNGE
6235-36641-0062 I APPROACHED THIS PHENOMENAL MOLLUSK ITS MASS OF FILAMENTS ATTACHED IT TO A TABLE OF GRANITE
6235-36641-0063 I ESTIMATED THE WEIGHT OF THIS GIANT CLAM AT THREE HUNDRED KILOGRAMS HENCE SUCH AN OYSTER HELD FIFTEEN KILOS OF MEAT AND YOU'D NEED THE STOMACH OF KING GARGANTUA TO EAT A COUPLE DOZEN
6235-36641-0064 AND I THOUGHT HIS SOLE REASON FOR LEADING US TO THIS LOCALITY
6235-36641-0065 ON THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THIS GIANT CLAM THE MOLLUSK'S TWO VALVES WERE PARTLY OPEN
6235-36641-0066 THEN WITH HIS HANDS HE RAISED THE FRINGED MEMBRANE FILLED TUNIC THAT MADE UP THE ANIMAL'S MANTLE THERE
6235-36641-0067 I SAW A LOOSE PEARL AS BIG AS A COCONUT ITS GLOBULAR SHAPE PERFECT CLARITY AND WONDERFUL ORIENT
6235-36641-0068 CARRIED AWAY BY CURIOSITY I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND TO TAKE IT WEIGH IT FONDLE IT BUT THE CAPTAIN STOPPED ME SIGNALED NO REMOVED HIS DAGGER IN ONE SWIFT MOTION
6235-36641-0069 HE ALLOWED IT TO GROW IMPERCEPTIBLY WITH EACH PASSING YEAR THE MOLLUSK'S SECRETIONS ADDED NEW CONCENTRIC LAYERS THE CAPTAIN ALONE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CAVE WHERE THIS WONDERFUL FRUIT OF NATURE WAS RIPENING
6235-36641-0070 HE ALONE REARED IT SO TO SPEAK IN ORDER TO TRANSFER IT ONE DAY TO HIS DEARLY BELOVED MUSEUM PERHAPS FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLES OF OYSTER FARMERS IN CHINA AND INDIA HE HAD EVEN PREDETERMINED THE CREATION OF THIS PEARL
6235-36641-0071 BY STICKING UNDER THE MOLLUSK'S FOLDS SOME PIECE OF GLASS OR METAL THAT WAS GRADUALLY COVERED WITH MOTHER OF PEARL IN ANY CASE COMPARING THIS PEARL TO OTHERS I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT
6235-36641-0072 AND TO THOSE SHIMMERING IN THE CAPTAIN'S COLLECTION I ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS WORTH AT LEAST TEN MILLION FRANCS IT WAS A SUPERB NATURAL CURIOSITY RATHER THAN A LUXURIOUS PIECE OF JEWELRY
6235-36641-0073 BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY FEMALE EAR THAT COULD HANDLE IT OUR VISIT TO THIS OPULENT GIANT CLAM CAME TO AN END
6235-36641-0074 NOT YET DISTURBED BY DIVERS AT WORK WE WALKED BY OURSELVES GENUINE LOITERERS STOPPING OR STRAYING AS OUR FANCIES DICTATED FOR MY PART I WAS NO LONGER WORRIED ABOUT THOSE DANGERS MY IMAGINATION HAD SO RIDICULOUSLY EXAGGERATED
6235-36641-0075 THE SHALLOWS DREW NOTICEABLY CLOSER TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SOON WALKING IN ONLY A METER OF WATER MY HEAD PASSED WELL ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE OCEAN CONSEIL REJOINED ME
6235-36641-0076 AND GLUING HIS HUGE COPPER CAPSULE TO MINE HIS EYES GAVE ME A FRIENDLY GREETING BUT THIS LOFTY PLATEAU MEASURED ONLY A FEW FATHOMS AND SOON WE REENTERED OUR ELEMENT I THINK I'VE NOW EARNED THE RIGHT TO DUB IT THAT TEN MINUTES LATER
6235-36641-0077 NO WITH A GESTURE HE ORDERED US TO CROUCH BESIDE HIM AT THE FOOT OF A WIDE CREVICE
6235-36641-0078 FIVE METERS AWAY A SHADOW APPEARED AND DROPPED TO THE SEAFLOOR THE ALARMING IDEA OF SHARKS CROSSED MY MIND BUT I WAS MISTAKEN
6235-36641-0079 IT WAS A MAN A LIVING MAN A BLACK INDIAN FISHERMAN A POOR DEVIL WHO NO DOUBT HAD COME TO GATHER WHAT HE COULD BEFORE HARVEST TIME I SAW THE BOTTOM OF HIS DINGHY MOORED A FEW FEET ABOVE HIS HEAD
6235-36641-0080 SERVED TO LOWER HIM MORE QUICKLY TO THE OCEAN FLOOR THIS WAS THE EXTENT OF HIS EQUIPMENT
6235-36641-0081 HE FELL TO HIS KNEES AND STUFFED HIS SACK WITH SHELLFISH GATHERED AT RANDOM
6235-36641-0082 PULLED UP HIS STONE AND STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN THE WHOLE PROCESS LASTING ONLY THIRTY SECONDS THIS DIVER DIDN'T SEE US A SHADOW CAST BY OUR CRAG HID US FROM HIS VIEW AND BESIDES
6235-36641-0083 HOW COULD THIS POOR INDIAN EVER HAVE GUESSED THAT HUMAN BEINGS CREATURES LIKE HIMSELF
6235-36641-0084 EAVESDROPPING ON HIS MOVEMENTS NOT MISSING A SINGLE DETAIL OF HIS FISHING SO HE WENT UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES HE GATHERED ONLY ABOUT TEN SHELLFISH PER DIVE
6235-36641-0085 BECAUSE HE HAD TO TEAR THEM FROM THE BANKS WHERE EACH CLUNG WITH ITS TOUGH MASS OF FILAMENTS AND HOW MANY OF THESE OYSTERS FOR WHICH HE RISKED HIS LIFE WOULD HAVE NO PEARL IN THEM I OBSERVED HIM WITH GREAT CARE
6235-36641-0086 HIS MOVEMENTS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY EXECUTED AND FOR HALF AN HOUR NO DANGER SEEMED TO THREATEN HIM
6235-36641-0087 WHEN ALL AT ONCE JUST AS THE INDIAN WAS KNEELING ON THE SEAFLOOR I SAW HIM MAKE A FRIGHTENED GESTURE
6235-36641-0088 I UNDERSTOOD HIS FEAR A GIGANTIC SHADOW APPEARED ABOVE THE POOR DIVER IT WAS A SHARK OF HUGE SIZE MOVING IN DIAGONALLY EYES ABLAZE JAWS WIDE OPEN I WAS SPEECHLESS WITH HORROR
6235-36641-0089 WHO JUMPED ASIDE AND AVOIDED THE SHARK'S BITE BUT NOT THE THRASHING OF ITS TAIL BECAUSE THAT TAIL STRUCK HIM ACROSS THE CHEST AND STRETCHED HIM OUT ON THE SEAFLOOR THIS SCENE LASTED BARELY A FEW SECONDS THE SHARK RETURNED ROLLED OVER ON ITS BACK
6235-36641-0090 WHO WAS STATIONED BESIDE ME SUDDENLY STOOD UP THEN HE STRODE RIGHT TOWARD THE MONSTER DAGGER IN HAND READY TO FIGHT IT AT CLOSE QUARTERS JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO SNAP UP THE POOR FISHERMAN THE MAN EATER SAW ITS NEW ADVERSARY
6235-36641-0091 REPOSITIONED ITSELF ON ITS BELLY AND HEADED SWIFTLY TOWARD HIM I CAN SEE CAPTAIN NEMO'S BEARING TO THIS DAY BRACING HIMSELF HE WAITED FOR THE FEARSOME MAN EATER
6235-36641-0092 AND WHEN THE LATTER RUSHED AT HIM THE CAPTAIN LEAPED ASIDE WITH PRODIGIOUS QUICKNESS AVOIDED A COLLISION AND SANK HIS DAGGER INTO ITS BELLY BUT THAT WASN'T THE END OF THE STORY A DREADFUL BATTLE WAS JOINED
6235-36641-0093 BELLOWED SO TO SPEAK BLOOD WAS POURING INTO THE WAVES FROM ITS WOUNDS
6235-36641-0094 NOTHING ELSE UNTIL THE MOMENT WHEN
6235-36641-0095 I SAW THE DARING CAPTAIN CLINGING TO ONE OF THE ANIMAL'S FINS FIGHTING THE MONSTER AT CLOSE QUARTERS BELABORING HIS
6235-36641-0096 A DIRECT HIT TO THE HEART IN ITS STRUGGLES THE MAN EATER CHURNED THE WATERY MASS SO FURIOUSLY ITS EDDIES THREATENED TO KNOCK ME OVER I WANTED TO RUN TO THE CAPTAIN'S RESCUE BUT I WAS TRANSFIXED WITH HORROR UNABLE TO MOVE
6235-36641-0097 I STARED WILD EYED I SAW THE FIGHT ENTER A NEW PHASE THE CAPTAIN FELL TO THE SEAFLOOR TOPPLED BY THE ENORMOUS MASS WEIGHING HIM DOWN THEN THE SHARK'S JAWS OPENED ASTOUNDINGLY WIDE LIKE A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL SHEARS
6235-36641-0098 HAD NOT NED LAND QUICK AS THOUGHT RUSHED FORWARD WITH HIS HARPOON AND DRIVEN ITS DREADFUL POINT INTO THE SHARK'S UNDERSIDE THE WAVES WERE SATURATED WITH MASSES OF BLOOD
6235-36641-0099 WHICH THRASHED ABOUT WITH INDESCRIBABLE FURY NED LAND HADN'T MISSED HIS TARGET THIS WAS THE MONSTER'S DEATH RATTLE PIERCED TO THE HEART IT WAS STRUGGLING WITH DREADFUL SPASMS
6235-36641-0100 WHOSE AFTERSHOCKS KNOCKED CONSEIL OFF HIS FEET MEANWHILE NED LAND PULLED THE CAPTAIN CLEAR UNINJURED THE LATTER STOOD UP WENT RIGHT TO THE INDIAN QUICKLY CUT THE ROPE BINDING THE MAN TO HIS STONE
6235-36641-0101 THE THREE OF US FOLLOWED HIM AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER MIRACULOUSLY SAFE WE REACHED THE FISHERMAN'S LONGBOAT CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST CONCERN WAS TO REVIVE THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN I WASN'T SURE HE WOULD SUCCEED
6235-36641-0102 I HOPED SO SINCE THE POOR DEVIL HADN'T BEEN UNDER VERY LONG BUT THAT STROKE FROM THE SHARK'S TAIL COULD HAVE BEEN HIS DEATHBLOW
6235-36641-0103 LITTLE BY LITTLE HE OPENED HIS EYES HOW STARTLED HE MUST HAVE FELT HOW FRIGHTENED EVEN AT SEEING FOUR HUGE COPPER CRANIUMS LEANING OVER HIM AND ABOVE ALL
6235-36641-0104 THIS MAGNIFICENT BENEFACTION FROM THE MAN OF THE WATERS TO THE POOR INDIAN FROM CEYLON WAS ACCEPTED BY THE LATTER WITH TREMBLING HANDS HIS BEWILDERED EYES INDICATED
6235-36641-0105 THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW TO WHAT SUPERHUMAN CREATURES HE OWED BOTH HIS LIFE AND HIS FORTUNE AT THE CAPTAIN'S SIGNAL WE RETURNED TO THE BANK OF SHELLFISH AND RETRACING OUR STEPS
6235-36641-0106 WE WALKED FOR HALF AN HOUR UNTIL WE ENCOUNTERED THE ANCHOR CONNECTING THE SEAFLOOR WITH THE NAUTILUS'S SKIFF BACK ON BOARD THE SAILORS HELPED DIVEST US OF OUR HEAVY COPPER CARAPACES CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST WORDS WERE SPOKEN TO THE CANADIAN
6235-36641-0107 THANK YOU MISTER LAND HE TOLD HIM TIT FOR TAT CAPTAIN NED LAND REPLIED I OWED IT TO YOU THE GHOST OF A SMILE GLIDED ACROSS THE CAPTAIN'S LIPS AND THAT WAS ALL
6235-36641-0108 TO THE NAUTILUS HE SAID THE LONGBOAT FLEW OVER THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES LATER WE ENCOUNTERED THE SHARK'S CORPSE AGAIN FLOATING FROM THE BLACK MARKINGS ON THE TIPS OF ITS FINS
6235-36641-0109 I RECOGNIZED THE DREADFUL SQUALUS MELANOPTERUS FROM THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES
6235-36641-0110 IT WAS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE FEET LONG ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH OCCUPIED A THIRD OF ITS BODY IT WAS AN ADULT AS COULD BE SEEN FROM THE SIX ROWS OF TEETH FORMING AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE IN ITS UPPER JAW
6235-36641-0111 CONSEIL LOOKED AT IT WITH PURELY SCIENTIFIC FASCINATION AND I'M SURE HE PLACED IT NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON IN THE CLASS
6235-36641-0112 ORDER CHONDROPTERYGIA WITH FIXED GILLS
6235-36641-0113 AROUND OUR LONGBOAT BUT PAYING NO ATTENTION TO US THEY POUNCED ON THE CORPSE AND QUARRELED OVER EVERY SCRAP OF IT BY EIGHT THIRTY WE WERE BACK ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS THERE I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT THE INCIDENTS THAT MARKED OUR EXCURSION
6235-36641-0114 OVER THE MANNAR OYSTERBANK TWO IMPRESSIONS INEVITABLY STOOD OUT ONE CONCERNED CAPTAIN NEMO'S MATCHLESS BRAVERY
6235-36641-0115 A REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT RACE FROM WHICH HE HAD FLED BENEATH THE SEAS IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THIS STRANGE MAN HADN'T YET SUCCEEDED IN COMPLETELY STIFLING HIS HEART
6235-36641-0116 WHEN I SHARED THESE IMPRESSIONS WITH HIM HE ANSWERED ME IN A TONE TOUCHED WITH EMOTION THAT INDIAN PROFESSOR LIVES IN THE LAND OF THE OPPRESSED AND I AM TO THIS DAY AND WILL BE UNTIL MY LAST
