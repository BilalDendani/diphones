5296-26680-0021 THE LAWYER BEGAN A FEW CONGRATULATORY REMARKS BUT DAVID STOPPED HIM WITH UPLIFTED HAND IT IS CALAMITOUS IT IS TOO TERRIBLE HE SAID SADLY AND WHAT IT BRINGS MAY BE FAR MORE OF A BURDEN THAN A JOY

5296-26680-0027 AND IT TAKES SOME TIME TO GET WONTED TO A NEW ONE HE GRAVELY LAID THE OLD ONE WITHIN EASY REACH OF HIS ARM AND RESTORED THE NEW ONE TO ITS BOX THEN HE SAT HIMSELF NEAR DAVID AND PLACED HIS HAND KINDLY ON HIS KNEE

5296-26680-0030 BETTER THAN I COULD DAVID LIFTED HIS EYES TO HIS OLD FRIEND'S THEN TURNED THEM AWAY I FEEL HIM TO BE A SACRED TRUST AGAIN HE PAUSED IT WOULD TAKE A
5296-26680-0031 LONG TIME TO GO TO HER FIRST TO HER FOR THE INSTANT THE OLD MAN HAD FORGOTTEN CASSANDRA NOT SO DAVID MY WIFE IT WILL BE DESPERATELY HARD
5296-26680-0032 FOR HER YES YES BUT YOUR UNCLE YOU KNOW DIED OF GRIEF AND YOUR M MOTHER I KNOW SO THE LAWYER SAID NOW AT LAST WE'LL READ MOTHER'S LETTER
5296-26680-0033 HE WONDERED I SUPPOSE THAT I DIDN'T LOOK AT IT WHEN HE GAVE IT TO ME BUT I FELT CONSCIENCE STRICKEN I'VE BEEN SO FILLED WITH MY LIFE DOWN THERE THE PEACE
5296-26680-0034 THAT I HAVE NEGLECTED HER MY OWN MOTHER I COULDN'T OPEN AND READ IT WITH THAT MAN'S EYES ON ME NO NO STAY HERE I BEG OF YOU STAY YOU ARE DIFFERENT I WANT YOU
5296-26680-0035 HE OPENED HIS MOTHER'S LETTER AND SLOWLY READ IT THEN PASSED IT TO HIS FRIEND AND RISING WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD GAZING DOWN INTO THE SQUARE
5296-26680-0036 LIKE FLOCKS OF BROWN AND YELLOW BIRDS ALONG THE STREET THE SKY WAS OVERCAST WITH THIN HURRYING CLOUDS AND THE FEELING OF AUTUMN WAS IN THE AIR BUT DAVID'S EYES WERE BLURRED AND HE SAW NOTHING BEFORE HIM
5296-26680-0037 THE DOCTOR'S VOICE BROKE THE SILENCE WITH SUDDEN IMPULSE IN THIS SHE SPEAKS AS IF SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE I TOLD YOU I HAD NEGLECTED HER CRIED DAVID CONTRITELY
5296-26680-0038 CRIED THE YOUNGER MAN DESPERATELY I COULD NEVER IN THE WORLD MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND ME OR MY MOTIVES I GAVE IT UP LONG AGO I'VE NOT TOLD MY MOTHER TO SAVE HER FROM A NEEDLESS SORROW THAT WOULD BE INFLICTED ON HER BY HER FRIENDS
5296-26680-0039 THEY WOULD ALL FLOCK TO HER AND PESTER HER WITH THEIR OUTCRY OF HOW VERY EXTRAORDINARY I CAN HEAR THEM AND SEE THEM NOW I TELL YOU IF A MAN STEPS OUT OF THE BEATEN TRACK OVER THERE IF HE ATTEMPTS TO ORDER HIS OWN LIFE MARRY TO PLEASE HIMSELF
5296-26680-0040 OR CUT HIS COAT AFTER ANY PATTERN OTHER THAN THE ORDINARY CONVENTIONAL LINES EVEN THE BOYS ON THE STREET WILL FLING STONES AT HIM HER PATRONIZING FRIENDS WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST POLITELY RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS SHE IS PROUD AND SENSITIVE
5296-26680-0041 AND ANY FLING AT HER SONS IS A BLOW TO HER BUT WHAT I SAY I COULDN'T TELL HER I TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN DRINKING FROM THE CUP OF HAPPINESS I HAVE DRAINED IT TO THE LAST DROP MY WIFE IS MINE
5296-26680-0042 SHE DOES NOT BELONG TO THOSE PEOPLE OVER THERE TO BE TALKED OVER AND DINED OVER AND ALL HER BEAUTY AND FINENESS OVERLOOKED THROUGH THEIR MONOCLES BRUTES MY MOUNTAIN FLOWER IN HER HOMESPUN DRESS
5296-26680-0043 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT DO ABOUT IT I MEANT TO KEEP HER TO MYSELF UNTIL THE RIGHT TIME CAME PERHAPS IN ANOTHER YEAR BRING HER HERE AND BEGIN LIFE IN A MODEST WAY AND LET MY MOTHER VISIT US AND SEE FOR HERSELF
5296-26680-0044 I WAS PLANNING IT OUT SLOWLY BUT THIS YOU SEE DOCTOR THEIR IDEAS ARE ALL WARPED OVER THERE THEY ACCEPT ALL THAT CUSTOM DECREES AND HAVE BUT THE ONE POINT OF VIEW
5296-26680-0045 THE TRUE VALUES OF LIFE ARE LOST SIGHT OF THEY HAVE NO HILLTOPS LIKE CASSANDRA'S ONLY THE POETS HAVE A QUIZZICAL SMILE PLAYED ABOUT THE OLD MAN'S MOUTH
5296-26680-0046 HE CAME AND LAID HIS ARM ACROSS DAVID'S SHOULDERS AND THE ACT SOFTENED THE SLIGHT STING OF HIS WORDS AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A POET NOT THAT SAID THE YOUNG MAN HUMBLY
5296-26680-0047 BUT I HAVE BEEN LEARNING I WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO BE CALLED A POET UNTIL I LEARNED OF THIS GIRL AND HER FATHER I THOUGHT I HAD IDEALS
5296-26680-0048 UNTIL I CAME DOWN TO THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS WITH THEM HER HER FATHER WHY HE'S DEAD HE
5296-26680-0049 I HAVE LEARNED OF HIM I BELIEVE HE WAS A MAN WHO WALKED WITH GOD AND AT CASSANDRA'S SIDE I HAVE TROD IN HIS SECRET PLACES THAT'S RIGHT I'M SATISFIED NOW ABOUT HER YOU'RE ALL RIGHT BUT
5296-26680-0050 BUT YOUR MOTHER DAVID TURNED AND WALKED TO THE TABLE AND SAT WITH HIS HEAD BOWED ON HIS ARMS HAD HE BEEN ALONE HE WOULD HAVE WEPT AS IT WAS HE SPOKE BROKENLY OF HIS OLD HOME
5296-26680-0051 AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES NOW SO RUTHLESSLY THRUST UPON HIM OF HIS MOTHER'S GRIEF AND HIS OWN
5296-26680-0052 AND THEREFORE HAD NEVER DESIRED NOW GIVEN HIM BY SO CRUEL A BLOW HE WOULD NOT SHRINK FROM WHATEVER DUTY
5296-26680-0053 AT LAST IT WAS DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD SAIL FOR ENGLAND WITHOUT DELAY TAKING THE PASSAGE ALREADY PROVISIONALLY ENGAGED FOR HIM BY MISTER STRETTON I CAN WRITE TO CASSANDRA SHE WILL UNDERSTAND MORE EASILY THAN MY MOTHER
5296-26680-0054 SHE SEES INTO THE HEART OF THINGS HER THOUGHTS GO TO THE TRUTH LIKE ARROWS OF LIGHT SHE WILL SEE THAT I MUST GO BUT SHE MUST NEVER KNOW I MUST SAVE HER FROM IT IF I HAVE TO DO SO AT THE EXPENSE OF MY OWN SOUL
5296-26680-0055 THAT THE REASON I CANNOT TAKE HER WITH ME NOW IS THAT OUR GREAT FRIENDS OVER THERE ARE TOO SMALL TO UNDERSTAND HER NATURE AND MIGHT DESPISE HER I MUST GO TO MY MOTHER FIRST AND FEEL MY WAY SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
5296-26680-0056 NEITHER OF THEM MUST BE MADE TO SUFFER THAT'S RIGHT PERFECTLY BUT DON'T WAIT TOO LONG JUST HAVE IT OUT WITH YOUR MOTHER ALL OF THEM
