6724-74002-0000 MISSUS WALLACE HAD WANTED TO GO TO SOME FASHIONABLE WATERING PLACE BUT HER HUSBAND HAD BLUNTLY TOLD HER HE COULDN'T AFFORD IT STAY IN THE CITY WHEN ALL HER SET WERE OUT SHE WOULD NOT AND THE AFORESAID FARMHOUSE HAD BEEN THE COMPROMISE
6724-74002-0001 I SHOULDN'T SUPPOSE IT COULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU WHO SHE IS SAID MISSUS WALLACE IMPATIENTLY I DO WISH PAULINE THAT YOU WERE MORE CAREFUL IN YOUR CHOICE OF ASSOCIATES YOU HOBNOB WITH EVERYONE
6724-74002-0002 PAULINE HID A RATHER UNDUTIFUL SMILE BEHIND HER NAPKIN AUNT OLIVIA'S SNOBBISH OPINIONS ALWAYS AMUSED HER YOU'VE NO IDEA WHAT AN INTERESTING OLD MAN HE IS SHE SAID HE CAN TALK MORE ENTERTAININGLY THAN ANY OTHER MAN I KNOW
6724-74002-0003 WHAT IS THE USE OF BEING SO EXCLUSIVE AUNT OLIVIA YOU MISS SO MUCH FUN YOU WOULDN'T BE SO HORRIBLY BORED AS YOU ARE IF YOU FRATERNIZED A LITTLE WITH THE NATIVES AS YOU CALL THEM NO THANK YOU SAID MISSUS WALLACE DISDAINFULLY
6724-74002-0004 WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MORGAN KNOWLES WOULD THINK IF THEY SAW YOU TAKING UP WITH SOME TOMBOY GIRL ON A FARM I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULD MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE WHAT THEY WOULD THINK SINCE THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE AWARE OF MY EXISTENCE OR EVEN OF YOURS AUNTY SAID PAULINE WITH TWINKLING EYES
6724-74002-0005 SHE KNEW IT WAS HER AUNT'S DEAREST DESIRE TO GET IN WITH THE MORGAN KNOWLES SET A DESIRE THAT SEEMED AS FAR FROM BEING REALIZED AS EVER MISSUS WALLACE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY THE MORGAN KNOWLES SHUT HER FROM THEIR CHARMED CIRCLE
6724-74002-0006 THEY CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE MUCH POORER AND OF MORE DOUBTFUL WORLDLY STATION THAN HERS THE MARKHAMS FOR INSTANCE
6724-74002-0007 JUST BEFORE SHE HAD LEFT COLCHESTER MISSUS WALLACE HAD SEEN MISSUS KNOWLES AND MISSUS MARKHAM TOGETHER IN THE FORMER'S AUTOMOBILE JAMES WALLACE AND MORGAN KNOWLES WERE ASSOCIATED IN BUSINESS DEALINGS BUT IN SPITE OF MISSUS WALLACE'S SCHEMINGS AND ASPIRATIONS AND HEART BURNINGS
6724-74002-0008 THE ASSOCIATION REMAINED A PURELY BUSINESS ONE AND NEVER ADVANCED AN INCH IN THE DIRECTION OF FRIENDSHIP AS FOR PAULINE SHE WAS HOPELESSLY DEVOID OF SOCIAL AMBITIONS AND SHE DID NOT IN THE LEAST MIND THE MORGAN KNOWLES REMOTE ATTITUDE BESIDES CONTINUED PAULINE
6724-74002-0009 SHE ISN'T A TOMBOY AT ALL SHE LOOKS LIKE A VERY WOMANLY WELL BRED SORT OF GIRL WHY SHOULD YOU THINK HER A TOMBOY BECAUSE SHE DRIVES COWS COWS ARE PLACID USEFUL ANIMALS WITNESS THIS DELICIOUS CREAM WHICH I AM POURING OVER MY BLUEBERRIES AND THEY HAVE TO BE DRIVEN IT'S AN HONEST OCCUPATION
6724-74002-0010 NOT A MITE SAID PAULINE CHEERFULLY ONE OF THE VERY NICEST GIRLS I EVER KNEW WAS A MAID MOTHER HAD THE LAST YEAR OF HER DEAR LIFE I LOVED THAT GIRL AUNT OLIVIA AND I CORRESPOND WITH HER SHE WRITES LETTERS THAT ARE TEN TIMES MORE CLEVER AND ENTERTAINING THAN THOSE STUPID EPISTLES CLARISSE GRAY SENDS ME
6724-74002-0011 ADA CAMERON I GUESS WAS MISSUS BOYD'S RESPONSE SHE LIVES WITH THE EMBREES DOWN ON THE OLD EMBREE PLACE JUST BELOW HERE THEY'RE PASTURING THEIR COWS ON THE UPPER FARM THIS SUMMER
6724-74002-0012 IS SHE AS NICE AS SHE LOOKS
6724-74002-0013 BUT I HOPE BETTER THINGS OF ADA MISSUS BOYD TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING
6724-74002-0014 I THINK THEY MUST MELLOW OCCASIONALLY INTO FUN AND JOLLITY AND WHOLESOME NONSENSE
6724-74002-0015 AND IF I CAN ONLY GET THAT COVE WITH ALL ITS BEAUTIFUL LIGHTS AND SHADOWS IT WILL BE THE GEM OF MY COLLECTION
6724-74002-0016 SHE CARRIED HERSELF WITH A PRETTY DIGNITY BUT WHEN HER EYES MET PAULINE'S SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD SMILE ON THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION PAULINE PROMPTLY GAVE HER THE PROVOCATION
6724-74002-0017 WON'T YOU PLEASE STOP A FEW MOMENTS AND LOOK ME OVER
6724-74002-0018 ADA CAMERON DID MORE THAN SMILE SHE LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AND WENT OVER TO THE FENCE WHERE PAULINE WAS SITTING ON A STUMP SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE MERRY BLACK EYES OF THE TOWN GIRL SHE HAD BEEN HALF ENVYING FOR A WEEK AND SAID HUMOROUSLY
6724-74002-0019 IF I'M ONE YOU'LL HAVE TO BE THE OTHER I'M THE OTHER SHAKE SAID PAULINE HOLDING OUT HER HAND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A FRIENDSHIP THAT MADE POOR MISSUS WALLACE GROAN OUTWARDLY AS WELL AS INWARDLY
6724-74002-0020 THEY WALKED ROWED BERRIED AND PICNICKED TOGETHER ADA DID NOT GO TO MISSUS BOYD'S A GREAT DEAL FOR SOME INSTINCT TOLD HER THAT MISSUS WALLACE DID NOT LOOK FAVOURABLY ON HER
6724-74002-0021 SHE HAD NEVER MET ANY GIRL SHE THOUGHT SO NICE AS ADA SHE IS NICE EVERY WAY SHE TOLD THE UNCONVINCED AUNT OLIVIA
6724-74002-0022 WITNESS HER LIKING FOR YOUR NIECE SHE CAN TALK INTERESTINGLY AND SHE CAN ALSO BE SILENT WHEN SILENCE IS BECOMING
6724-74002-0023 AUNT OLIVIA MAY I ASK HER TO VISIT ME NEXT WINTER NO INDEED SAID MISSUS WALLACE WITH CRUSHING EMPHASIS
6724-74002-0024 OH AUNTY DEAR CAN'T YOU SEE THAT ADA IS JUST THE SAME GIRL IN COTTON PRINT THAT SHE WOULD BE IN SILK ATTIRE SHE IS REALLY FAR MORE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING THAN ANY GIRL IN THE KNOWLES SET PAULINE SAID AUNT OLIVIA LOOKING AS SHOCKED AS IF PAULINE HAD COMMITTED BLASPHEMY
6724-74002-0025 PAULINE LAUGHED AGAIN BUT SHE SIGHED AS SHE WENT TO HER ROOM AUNT OLIVIA HAS THE KINDEST HEART IN THE WORLD SHE THOUGHT WHAT A PITY SHE ISN'T ABLE TO SEE THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE MY FRIENDSHIP WITH ADA CAN'T BE PERFECT IF I CAN'T INVITE HER TO MY HOME
6724-74002-0026 THE SUMMER WANED AND AUGUST BURNED ITSELF OUT
6724-74002-0027 THE TWO GIRLS WERE IN THE EMBREE GARDEN WHERE PAULINE WAS PREPARING TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADA STANDING AMONG THE ASTERS WITH A GREAT SHEAF OF THEM IN HER ARMS
6724-74002-0028 I DON'T THINK I SHALL BE HERE THEN SAID ADA WITH A SIGH YOU SEE IT IS TIME I WAS DOING SOMETHING FOR MYSELF PAULINE
6724-74002-0029 BUT THEY HAVE A LARGE FAMILY AND ARE NOT VERY WELL OFF SO I THINK I'LL TRY FOR A SITUATION IN ONE OF THE REMINGTON STORES THIS FALL IT'S SUCH A PITY YOU COULDN'T HAVE GONE TO THE ACADEMY AND STUDIED FOR A TEACHER'S LICENCE SAID PAULINE
6724-74002-0030 YOU COULDN'T LOOK ANYTHING ELSE LAUGHED PAULINE DON'T SMILE TOO BROADLY I WANT YOU TO BE LOOKING OVER THE ASTERS WITH A BIT OF A DREAM ON YOUR FACE AND IN YOUR EYES IF THE PICTURE TURNS OUT AS BEAUTIFUL AS I FONDLY EXPECT
6724-74002-0031 THERE THAT'S THE VERY EXPRESSION
6724-74002-0032 ALL READY NOW DON'T MOVE THERE DEARIE IT IS ALL OVER WHEN PAULINE WENT BACK TO COLCHESTER SHE WAS BUSY FOR A MONTH PREPARING HER PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE EXHIBITION
6724-74002-0033 A TALL GIRL WITH A WISTFUL FACE STANDING IN AN OLD FASHIONED GARDEN WITH HER ARMS FULL OF ASTERS THE VERY DAY AFTER THE EXHIBITION WAS OPENED THE MORGAN KNOWLES AUTOMOBILE STOPPED AT THE WALLACE DOOR
6724-74002-0034 MISSUS WALLACE WAS OUT BUT IT WAS PAULINE WHOM STATELY MISSUS MORGAN KNOWLES ASKED FOR PAULINE WAS AT THAT MOMENT BURIED IN HER DARKROOM DEVELOPING PHOTOGRAPHS AND SHE RAN DOWN JUST AS SHE WAS
6724-74002-0035 BUT MISSUS MORGAN KNOWLES DID NOT SEEM TO MIND AT ALL SHE LIKED PAULINE'S SIMPLICITY OF MANNER IT WAS MORE THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED FROM THE AUNT'S RATHER VULGAR AFFECTATIONS
6724-74002-0036 THE RESEMBLANCE TO A VERY DEAR CHILDHOOD FRIEND OF MINE IS SO STARTLING THAT I AM SURE IT CANNOT BE ACCIDENTAL
6724-74002-0037 SHE MUST BE ADA FRAME'S DAUGHTER THEN EXCLAIMED MISSUS KNOWLES IN EXCITEMENT THEN SEEING PAULINE'S PUZZLED FACE SHE EXPLAINED YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A CHILD I ALWAYS SPENT MY SUMMERS ON THE FARM OF MY UNCLE JOHN FRAME MY COUSIN ADA FRAME WAS THE DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
6724-74002-0038 BUT AFTER WE GREW UP WE SAW NOTHING OF EACH OTHER FOR I WENT WITH MY PARENTS TO EUROPE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND ADA MARRIED A NEIGHBOUR'S SON ALEC CAMERON AND WENT OUT WEST
6724-74002-0039 WHEN SOMEBODY TOLD ME SHE WAS DEAD AND HAD LEFT NO FAMILY
6724-74002-0040 I BELIEVE SHE IS SAID PAULINE QUICKLY ADA WAS BORN OUT WEST AND LIVED THERE UNTIL SHE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HER PARENTS DIED AND SHE WAS SENT EAST TO HER FATHER'S HALF SISTER
6724-74002-0041 SHE COULDN'T BE ANYTHING ELSE IF SHE IS ADA FRAME'S DAUGHTER SAID MISSUS KNOWLES
6724-74002-0042 BUT TO HEAR AUNT OLIVIA TALK NOW YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THAT SHE AND NOT PAULINE HAD DISCOVERED ADA
6724-74002-0043 AND THE SUMMER FRIENDSHIP PROVED A LIFE LONG ONE AND WAS FOR THE WALLACES THE OPEN SESAME TO THE ENCHANTED GROUND OF THE KNOWLES
