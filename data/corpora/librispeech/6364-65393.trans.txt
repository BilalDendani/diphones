6364-65393-0000 I BRING THE APPARENT INCONSISTENCY FORWARD AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS APPENDIX BECAUSE THE ILLUSTRATION OF IT WILL BE FARTHER USEFUL IN SHOWING THE REAL NATURE OF THE SELF CONTRADICTION WHICH IS OFTEN ALLEGED AGAINST ME BY CARELESS READERS IT IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE
6364-65393-0001 BUT A FREQUENT CONDITION OF HUMAN ACTION TO DO RIGHT AND BE RIGHT YET SO AS TO MISLEAD OTHER PEOPLE IF THEY RASHLY IMITATE THE THING DONE FOR THERE ARE MANY RIGHTS WHICH ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY BUT RELATIVELY RIGHT
6364-65393-0002 RIGHT ONLY FOR THAT PERSON TO DO UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT FOR THIS PERSON TO DO UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THUS IT STANDS BETWEEN TITIAN AND TINTORET TITIAN IS ALWAYS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
6364-65393-0003 YOU MAY IMITATE HIM WITH ENTIRE SECURITY THAT YOU ARE DOING THE BEST THING THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE FOR THE PURPOSE IN HAND TINTORET IS ALWAYS RELATIVELY RIGHT RELATIVELY TO HIS OWN AIMS AND PECULIAR POWERS
6364-65393-0004 HE BECOMES ENTIRELY INSTRUCTIVE AND EXEMPLARY JUST AS TITIAN IS
6364-65393-0005 AND YOU CAN ONLY STUDY HIM RIGHTLY WITH THAT REVERENCE FOR HIM THEN THE ARTISTS WHO ARE NAMED AS ADMITTING QUESTION OF RIGHT AND WRONG
6364-65393-0006 EVEN WITH RELATION TO THEIR OWN AIMS AND POWERS TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE QUALITY OF IMPERFECTION IN DRAWING FORM THERE ARE MANY PICTURES OF TINTORET IN WHICH THE TREES ARE DRAWN WITH A FEW CURVED FLOURISHES OF THE BRUSH INSTEAD OF LEAVES
6364-65393-0007 THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG IF YOU COPIED THE TREE AS A MODEL YOU WOULD BE GOING VERY WRONG INDEED BUT IT IS RELATIVELY AND FOR TINTORET'S PURPOSES RIGHT IN THE NATURE OF THE SUPERFICIAL WORK
6364-65393-0008 LET HIM WAIT ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES AND THIS IS THE BEST FOLIAGE WE CAN DO IN THE TIME ENTIRELY ADMIRABLY UNSURPASSABLY RIGHT UNDER THE CONDITIONS TITIAN WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED UNDER THEM BUT TINTORET WAS KINDER AND HUMBLER
6364-65393-0009 YET HE MAY LEAD YOU WRONG IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM OR PERHAPS ANOTHER DAY SOMEBODY CAME IN WHILE TINTORET WAS AT WORK WHO TORMENTED TINTORET AN IGNOBLE PERSON
6364-65393-0010 TINTORET CANNOT STAND THE IGNOBLENESS IT IS UNENDURABLY REPULSIVE AND DISCOMFITING TO HIM THE BLACK PLAGUE TAKE HIM AND THE TREES TOO SHALL SUCH A FELLOW SEE ME PAINT AND THE TREES GO ALL TO PIECES
6364-65393-0011 THIS IN YOU WOULD BE MERE ILL BREEDING AND ILL TEMPER IN TINTORET IT WAS ONE OF THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS OF HIS INTENSE SENSIBILITY HAD HE BEEN CAPABLE THEN OF KEEPING HIS TEMPER HE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE HIS GREATEST WORKS
6364-65393-0012 LET THE TREES GO TO PIECES BY ALL MEANS IT IS QUITE RIGHT THEY SHOULD HE IS ALWAYS RIGHT BUT IN A BACKGROUND OF GAINSBOROUGH YOU WOULD FIND THE TREES UNJUSTIFIABLY GONE TO PIECES
6364-65393-0013 FOOTNOTE AT LEAST AFTER HIS STYLE WAS FORMED EARLY PICTURES LIKE THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI IN OUR GALLERY ARE OF LITTLE VALUE
6364-65393-0014 ONLY ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO SAY THINGS THAT SHOCK PEOPLE SOME WORDS OF WARNING AGAINST PAINTERS LIKELY TO MISLEAD THE STUDENT FOR INDEED THOUGH HERE AND THERE SOMETHING MAY BE GAINED BY LOOKING AT INFERIOR MEN THERE IS ALWAYS MORE TO BE GAINED BY LOOKING AT THE BEST
6364-65393-0015 AND THERE IS NOT TIME WITH ALL THE LOOKING OF HUMAN LIFE TO EXHAUST EVEN ONE GREAT PAINTER'S INSTRUCTION HOW THEN SHALL WE DARE TO WASTE OUR SIGHT AND THOUGHTS ON INFERIOR ONES EVEN IF WE COULD DO SO
6364-65393-0016 WHICH WE RARELY CAN WITHOUT DANGER OF BEING LED ASTRAY NAY STRICTLY SPEAKING WHAT PEOPLE CALL INFERIOR PAINTERS ARE IN GENERAL NO PAINTERS ARTISTS ARE DIVIDED BY AN IMPASSABLE GULF INTO THE MEN WHO CAN PAINT
6364-65393-0017 AND WHO CANNOT THE MEN WHO CAN PAINT OFTEN FALL SHORT OF WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE ARE REPRESSED OR DEFEATED OR OTHERWISE RENDERED INFERIOR ONE TO ANOTHER STILL THERE IS AN EVERLASTING BARRIER BETWEEN THEM
6364-65393-0018 AND THE MEN WHO CANNOT PAINT WHO CAN ONLY IN VARIOUS POPULAR WAYS PRETEND TO PAINT AND IF ONCE YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE THERE IS ALWAYS SOME GOOD TO BE GOT BY LOOKING AT A REAL PAINTER
6364-65393-0019 SELDOM ANYTHING BUT MISCHIEF TO BE GOT OUT OF A FALSE ONE BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE REAL PAINTERS ARE COMMON I DO NOT SPEAK OF LIVING MEN BUT AMONG THOSE WHO LABOUR NO MORE IN THIS ENGLAND OF OURS SINCE IT FIRST HAD A SCHOOL
6364-65393-0020 WE HAVE HAD ONLY FIVE REAL PAINTERS REYNOLDS GAINSBOROUGH HOGARTH RICHARD WILSON AND TURNER THE READER MAY PERHAPS THINK I HAVE FORGOTTEN WILKIE NO I ONCE MUCH OVERRATED HIM AS AN EXPRESSIONAL DRAUGHTSMAN
6364-65393-0021 NOT HAVING THEN STUDIED THE FIGURE LONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DETECT SUPERFICIAL SENTIMENT
6364-65393-0022 IT IS ENTIRELY FALSE AND VALUELESS
6364-65393-0023 THOUGH UNPARALLELED FOR NARROWNESS WERE AS FAR AS THEY WENT TRUE BUT AS IT IS HE IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN INDUSTRIOUS AND INNOCENT AMATEUR BLUNDERING HIS WAY TO A SUPERFICIAL EXPRESSION OF ONE OR TWO POPULAR ASPECTS OF COMMON NATURE
6364-65393-0024 AND MY READERS MAY DEPEND UPON IT THAT ALL BLAME WHICH I EXPRESS IN THIS SWEEPING WAY IS TRUSTWORTHY I HAVE OFTEN HAD TO REPENT OF OVER PRAISE OF INFERIOR MEN AND CONTINUALLY TO REPENT OF INSUFFICIENT PRAISE OF GREAT MEN
6364-65393-0025 HE MAY BE ASSURED EVERY WORD IS TRUE FOOTNOTE HE MUST HOWEVER BE CAREFUL TO DISTINGUISH BLAME HOWEVER STRONGLY EXPRESSED OF SOME SPECIAL FAULT OR ERROR IN A TRUE PAINTER
6364-65393-0026 FROM THESE GENERAL STATEMENTS OF INFERIORITY OR WORTHLESSNESS THUS HE WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY LAUGHING AT WILSON'S TREE PAINTING
6364-65393-0027 IT IS JUST BECAUSE IT SO MUCH OFFENDS HIM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY AND KNOWING THAT IT MUST OFFEND HIM I SHOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO SAY IT WITHOUT CERTAINTY OF ITS TRUTH I SAY CERTAINTY FOR IT IS JUST AS POSSIBLE TO BE CERTAIN
6364-65393-0028 AS WHETHER THE DRAWING OF A TRIANGLE IS AND WHAT I MEAN PRIMARILY BY SAYING THAT A PICTURE IS IN ALL RESPECTS WORTHLESS IS THAT IT IS IN ALL RESPECTS FALSE WHICH IS NOT A MATTER OF OPINION AT ALL
6364-65393-0029 BUT A MATTER OF ASCERTAINABLE FACT SUCH AS I NEVER ASSERT TILL I HAVE ASCERTAINED AND THE THING SO COMMONLY SAID ABOUT MY WRITINGS THAT THEY ARE RATHER PERSUASIVE THAN JUST
6364-65393-0030 AND THAT THOUGH MY LANGUAGE MAY BE GOOD I AM AN UNSAFE GUIDE IN ART CRITICISM IS LIKE MANY OTHER POPULAR ESTIMATES IN SUCH MATTERS NOT MERELY UNTRUE BUT PRECISELY THE REVERSE OF THE TRUTH
6364-65393-0031 IT IS TRUTH LIKE REFLECTIONS IN WATER DISTORTED MUCH BY THE SHAKING RECEPTIVE SURFACE AND IN EVERY PARTICULAR UPSIDE DOWN FOR MY LANGUAGE
6364-65393-0032 AND STILL THOUGH I HAVE TRIED HARD TO MEND IT THE BEST I CAN DO IS INFERIOR TO MUCH CONTEMPORARY WORK NO DESCRIPTION THAT I HAVE EVER GIVEN OF ANYTHING IS WORTH FOUR LINES OF TENNYSON AND IN SERIOUS THOUGHT
6364-65393-0033 BUT I AM AN ENTIRELY SAFE GUIDE IN ART JUDGMENT AND THAT
6364-65393-0034 IT IS QUITE EASY FOR INSTANCE TO TAKE AN ACCIDENTAL IRREGULARITY IN A PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE WHICH LESS CAREFUL EXAMINATION WOULD NEVER HAVE DETECTED AT ALL FOR AN INTENTIONAL IRREGULARITY QUITE POSSIBLE TO MISINTERPRET AN OBSCURE PASSAGE IN A PICTURE
6364-65393-0035 FALLS FORWARD ON THE ROAD NOT INTO THE DITCH BESIDE IT AND THEY ARE SURE TO BE CORRECTED BY THE NEXT COMER BUT THE BLUNT AND DEAD MISTAKES MADE BY TOO MANY OTHER WRITERS ON ART THE MISTAKES OF SHEER INATTENTION AND WANT OF SYMPATHY
6364-65393-0036 NAY QUITE BOTTOMLESS AND UNREDEEMABLE MISTAKE IS THE FOOL'S THOUGHT THAT HE HAD NO MEANING I DO NOT REFER IN SAYING THIS TO ANY OF MY STATEMENTS RESPECTING SUBJECTS WHICH IT HAS BEEN MY MAIN WORK TO STUDY
6364-65393-0037 AS FAR AS I AM AWARE I HAVE NEVER YET MISINTERPRETED ANY PICTURE OF TURNER'S THOUGH OFTEN REMAINING BLIND TO THE HALF OF WHAT HE HAD INTENDED NEITHER HAVE I AS YET FOUND ANYTHING TO CORRECT IN MY STATEMENTS RESPECTING VENETIAN ARCHITECTURE
6364-65393-0038 THEY WILL BE FOUND BY EVERY ONE WHO WILL TAKE THE PAINS TO EXAMINE THEM MOST ASSUREDLY AND INDISPUTABLY INTENTIONAL AND NOT ONLY SO BUT ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS OF THE DESIGNER'S CARE
6364-65393-0039 APPENDIX TWO REYNOLDS DISAPPOINTMENT
6364-65393-0040 RECORD IS PRESERVED OF SIR JOSHUA'S FEELINGS RESPECTING THE PAINTINGS IN THE WINDOW OF NEW COLLEGE WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO GIVE HIS FULL SANCTION TO THIS MODE OF PAINTING ON GLASS
6364-65393-0041 BUT SO IT IS AND WITH THE SIMPLICITY AND HUMBLENESS OF AN ENTIRELY GREAT MAN HE HOPES THAT MISTER JERVAS ON GLASS IS TO EXCEL SIR JOSHUA ON CANVAS HAPPILY MASON TELLS US THE RESULT
6364-65393-0042 HOW GREATLY THAT EFFECT WOULD BE HEIGHTENED BY THE TRANSPARENCY WHICH THE PAINTING ON GLASS WOULD BE SURE TO PRODUCE IT TURNED OUT QUITE THE REVERSE APPENDIX THREE CLASSICAL ARCHITECTURE
