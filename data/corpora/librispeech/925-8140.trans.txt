925-8140-0000 NOTHING COULD BE MORE STRIKING THAN TO FIND THIS HERE WE ARE INCLINED TO LOOK UPON BAD TEMPER AS A VERY HARMLESS WEAKNESS WE SPEAK OF IT AS A MERE INFIRMITY OF NATURE A FAMILY FAILING A MATTER OF TEMPERAMENT
925-8140-0001 AS ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE ELEMENTS IN HUMAN NATURE THE PECULIARITY OF ILL TEMPER IS THAT IT IS THE VICE OF THE VIRTUOUS
925-8140-0002 OR TOUCHY DISPOSITION THIS COMPATIBILITY OF ILL TEMPER WITH HIGH MORAL CHARACTER IS ONE OF THE STRANGEST AND SADDEST PROBLEMS OF ETHICS
925-8140-0003 SINS OF THE BODY AND SINS OF THE DISPOSITION THE PRODIGAL SON MAY BE TAKEN AS A TYPE OF THE FIRST THE ELDER BROTHER OF THE SECOND
925-8140-0004 ITS BRAND FALLS WITHOUT A CHALLENGE UPON THE PRODIGAL BUT ARE WE RIGHT
925-8140-0005 AND COARSER AND FINER ARE BUT HUMAN WORDS BUT FAULTS IN THE HIGHER NATURE MAY BE LESS VENAL THAN THOSE IN THE LOWER AND TO THE EYE OF HIM WHO IS LOVE A SIN AGAINST LOVE
925-8140-0006 MAY SEEM A HUNDRED TIMES MORE BASE NO FORM OF VICE NOT WORLDLINESS NOT GREED OF GOLD NOT DRUNKENNESS ITSELF DOES MORE TO UN CHRISTIANIZE SOCIETY
925-8140-0007 FOR TAKING THE BLOOM OF CHILDHOOD IN SHORT FOR SHEER GRATUITOUS MISERY PRODUCING POWER THIS INFLUENCE STANDS ALONE
925-8140-0008 LOOK AT THE ELDER BROTHER MORAL HARD WORKING PATIENT DUTIFUL LET HIM GET ALL CREDIT FOR HIS VIRTUES LOOK AT THIS MAN THIS BABY
925-8140-0009 HE WAS ANGRY WE READ AND WOULD NOT GO IN LOOK AT THE EFFECT UPON THE FATHER UPON THE SERVANTS UPON THE HAPPINESS OF THE GUESTS
925-8140-0010 AND HOW MANY PRODIGALS ARE KEPT OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
925-8140-0011 ANALYZE AS A STUDY IN TEMPER THE THUNDER CLOUD ITSELF AS IT GATHERS UPON THE ELDER BROTHER'S BROW WHAT IS IT MADE OF JEALOUSY ANGER
925-8140-0012 IN VARYING PROPORTIONS ALSO THESE ARE THE INGREDIENTS OF ALL ILL TEMPER JUDGE IF SUCH SINS OF THE DISPOSITION ARE NOT WORSE TO LIVE IN
925-8140-0013 THERE IS REALLY NO PLACE IN HEAVEN FOR A DISPOSITION LIKE THIS A MAN WITH SUCH A MOOD COULD ONLY MAKE HEAVEN MISERABLE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN IT
925-8140-0014 EXCEPT THEREFORE SUCH A MAN BE BORN AGAIN HE CANNOT
925-8140-0015 IT IS NOT IN WHAT IT IS ALONE BUT IN WHAT IT REVEALS
925-8140-0016 THE OCCASIONAL BUBBLE ESCAPING TO THE SURFACE WHICH BETRAYS SOME ROTTENNESS UNDERNEATH A SAMPLE OF THE MOST HIDDEN PRODUCTS OF THE SOUL DROPPED INVOLUNTARILY
925-8140-0017 A WANT OF KINDNESS A WANT OF GENEROSITY A WANT OF COURTESY A WANT OF UNSELFISHNESS ARE ALL INSTANTANEOUSLY SYMBOLIZED IN ONE FLASH OF TEMPER
925-8140-0018 HENCE IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE TEMPER WE MUST GO TO THE SOURCE AND CHANGE THE INMOST NATURE AND THE ANGRY HUMORS WILL DIE AWAY OF THEMSELVES
925-8140-0019 SOULS ARE MADE SWEET NOT BY TAKING THE ACID FLUIDS OUT
925-8140-0020 A GREAT LOVE A NEW SPIRIT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST CHRIST THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST INTERPENETRATING OURS SWEETENS PURIFIES TRANSFORMS ALL
925-8140-0021 TIME DOES NOT CHANGE MEN CHRIST DOES THEREFORE LET THAT MIND BE IN YOU WHICH WAS ALSO IN CHRIST JESUS
925-8140-0022 SOME OF US HAVE NOT MUCH TIME TO LOSE REMEMBER ONCE MORE
925-8140-0023 I CANNOT HELP SPEAKING URGENTLY FOR MYSELF FOR YOURSELVES WHOSO SHALL OFFEND ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES WHICH BELIEVE IN ME IT WERE BETTER FOR HIM
925-8140-0024 NOT TO LIVE THAN NOT TO LOVE IT IS BETTER NOT TO LIVE THAN NOT TO LOVE GUILELESSNESS
925-8140-0025 GUILELESSNESS IS THE GRACE FOR SUSPICIOUS PEOPLE
925-8140-0026 IS THE GREAT SECRET OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE YOU WILL FIND IF YOU THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO INFLUENCE YOU ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN YOU IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF SUSPICION MEN SHRIVEL UP
925-8140-0027 BUT IN THAT ATMOSPHERE THEY EXPAND AND FIND ENCOURAGEMENT AND EDUCATIVE FELLOWSHIP IT IS A WONDERFUL THING THAT HERE AND THERE IN THIS HARD UNCHARITABLE WORLD
925-8140-0028 THERE SHOULD STILL BE LEFT A FEW RARE SOULS WHO THINK NO EVIL THIS IS THE GREAT UNWORLDLINESS LOVE THINKETH NO EVIL
925-8140-0029 IMPUTES NO MOTIVE SEES THE BRIGHT SIDE PUTS THE BEST CONSTRUCTION ON EVERY ACTION WHAT A DELIGHTFUL STATE OF MIND TO LIVE IN
925-8140-0030 WHAT A STIMULUS AND BENEDICTION EVEN TO MEET WITH IT FOR A DAY TO BE TRUSTED IS TO BE SAVED AND IF WE TRY TO INFLUENCE OR ELEVATE OTHERS
925-8140-0031 WE SHALL SOON SEE THAT SUCCESS IS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR BELIEF OF OUR BELIEF IN THEM
925-8140-0032 IS THE FIRST RESTORATION OF THE SELF RESPECT A MAN HAS LOST OUR IDEAL OF WHAT HE IS BECOMES TO HIM THE HOPE AND PATTERN OF WHAT HE MAY BECOME
925-8140-0033 I HAVE CALLED THIS SINCERITY FROM THE WORDS RENDERED IN THE AUTHORIZED VERSION BY REJOICETH IN THE TRUTH AND CERTAINLY WERE THIS THE REAL TRANSLATION NOTHING COULD BE MORE JUST
925-8140-0034 FOR HE WHO LOVES WILL LOVE TRUTH NOT LESS THAN MEN HE WILL REJOICE IN THE TRUTH REJOICE NOT IN WHAT HE HAS BEEN TAUGHT TO BELIEVE NOT IN THIS CHURCH'S DOCTRINE OR IN THAT
925-8140-0035 NOT IN THIS ISM OR IN THAT ISM BUT IN THE TRUTH HE WILL ACCEPT ONLY WHAT IS REAL HE WILL STRIVE TO GET AT FACTS
925-8140-0036 HE WILL SEARCH FOR TRUTH WITH A HUMBLE AND UNBIASED MIND AND CHERISH WHATEVER HE FINDS AT ANY SACRIFICE BUT THE MORE LITERAL TRANSLATION OF THE REVISED VERSION
925-8140-0037 CALLS FOR JUST SUCH A SACRIFICE FOR TRUTH'S SAKE HERE FOR WHAT PAUL REALLY MEANT IS
925-8140-0038 BUT REJOICETH WITH THE TRUTH A QUALITY WHICH PROBABLY NO ONE ENGLISH WORD AND CERTAINLY NOT SINCERITY ADEQUATELY DEFINES
925-8140-0039 IT INCLUDES PERHAPS MORE STRICTLY THE SELF RESTRAINT WHICH REFUSES TO MAKE CAPITAL OUT OF OTHERS FAULTS
925-8140-0040 THE CHARITY WHICH DELIGHTS NOT IN EXPOSING THE WEAKNESS OF OTHERS BUT COVERETH ALL THINGS
