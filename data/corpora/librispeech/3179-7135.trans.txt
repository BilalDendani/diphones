3179-7135-0000 ANNE'S HISTORY DO YOU KNOW SAID ANNE CONFIDENTIALLY I'VE MADE UP MY MIND TO ENJOY THIS DRIVE IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN NEARLY ALWAYS ENJOY THINGS IF YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND FIRMLY THAT YOU WILL OF COURSE YOU MUST MAKE IT UP FIRMLY
3179-7135-0001 I'M JUST GOING TO THINK ABOUT THE DRIVE OH LOOK THERE'S ONE LITTLE EARLY WILD ROSE OUT ISN'T IT LOVELY DON'T YOU THINK IT MUST BE GLAD TO BE A ROSE
3179-7135-0002 I'M SURE THEY COULD TELL US SUCH LOVELY THINGS AND ISN'T PINK THE MOST BEWITCHING COLOR IN THE WORLD I LOVE IT BUT I CAN'T WEAR IT REDHEADED PEOPLE CAN'T WEAR PINK NOT EVEN IN IMAGINATION
3179-7135-0003 DID YOU EVER KNOW OF ANYBODY WHOSE HAIR WAS RED WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG BUT GOT TO BE ANOTHER COLOR WHEN SHE GREW UP NO
3179-7135-0004 AND I SHOULDN'T THINK IT LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN YOUR CASE EITHER ANNE SIGHED WELL THAT IS ANOTHER HOPE GONE MY LIFE IS A PERFECT GRAVEYARD OF BURIED HOPES
3179-7135-0005 I DON'T SEE WHERE THE COMFORTING COMES IN MYSELF SAID MARILLA WHY BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO NICE AND ROMANTIC JUST AS IF I WERE A HEROINE IN A BOOK YOU KNOW I AM SO FOND OF ROMANTIC THINGS
3179-7135-0006 AND A GRAVEYARD FULL OF BURIED HOPES IS ABOUT AS ROMANTIC A THING AS ONE CAN IMAGINE ISN'T IT I'M RATHER GLAD I HAVE ONE ARE WE GOING ACROSS THE LAKE OF SHINING WATERS TODAY
3179-7135-0007 WE'RE GOING BY THE SHORE ROAD SHORE ROAD SOUNDS NICE SAID ANNE DREAMILY IS IT AS NICE AS IT SOUNDS JUST WHEN YOU SAID
3179-7135-0008 AND WHITE SANDS IS A PRETTY NAME TOO BUT I DON'T LIKE IT AS WELL AS AVONLEA AVONLEA IS A LOVELY NAME
3179-7135-0009 HOW FAR IS IT TO WHITE SANDS IT'S FIVE MILES AND AS YOU'RE EVIDENTLY BENT ON TALKING YOU MIGHT AS WELL TALK TO SOME PURPOSE BY TELLING ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT YOURSELF
3179-7135-0010 IF YOU'LL ONLY LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I IMAGINE ABOUT MYSELF YOU'LL THINK IT EVER SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING
3179-7135-0011 I WAS ELEVEN LAST MARCH SAID ANNE RESIGNING HERSELF TO BALD FACTS WITH A LITTLE SIGH AND I WAS BORN IN BOLINGBROKE NOVA SCOTIA
3179-7135-0012 MY MOTHER'S NAME WAS BERTHA SHIRLEY AREN'T WALTER AND BERTHA LOVELY NAMES I'M SO GLAD MY PARENTS HAD NICE NAMES
3179-7135-0013 WELL SAY JEDEDIAH WOULDN'T IT
3179-7135-0014 BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO BELIEVE IT I DON'T BELIEVE A ROSE WOULD BE AS NICE IF IT WAS CALLED A THISTLE OR A SKUNK CABBAGE
3179-7135-0015 A HUSBAND WAS ENOUGH RESPONSIBILITY MISSUS THOMAS SAID THAT THEY WERE A PAIR OF BABIES AND AS POOR AS CHURCH MICE
3179-7135-0016 YES AND MUSLIN CURTAINS IN ALL THE WINDOWS MUSLIN CURTAINS GIVE A HOUSE SUCH AN AIR I WAS BORN IN THAT HOUSE MISSUS THOMAS SAID I WAS THE HOMELIEST BABY SHE EVER SAW I WAS SO SCRAWNY AND TINY AND NOTHING BUT EYES
3179-7135-0017 BUT THAT MOTHER THOUGHT I WAS PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL I SHOULD THINK A MOTHER WOULD BE A BETTER JUDGE THAN A POOR WOMAN WHO CAME IN TO SCRUB WOULDN'T YOU I'M GLAD SHE WAS SATISFIED WITH ME ANYHOW
3179-7135-0018 BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LIVE VERY LONG AFTER THAT YOU SEE SHE DIED OF FEVER WHEN I WAS JUST THREE MONTHS OLD I DO WISH SHE'D LIVED LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO REMEMBER CALLING HER MOTHER
3179-7135-0019 AND FATHER DIED FOUR DAYS AFTERWARDS
3179-7135-0020 THAT LEFT ME AN ORPHAN AND FOLKS WERE AT THEIR WITS END SO MISSUS THOMAS SAID WHAT TO DO WITH ME YOU SEE NOBODY WANTED ME EVEN THEN IT SEEMS TO BE MY FATE
3179-7135-0021 BROUGHT UP BY HAND THAT OUGHT TO MAKE PEOPLE WHO ARE BROUGHT UP THAT WAY BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE WHENEVER I WAS NAUGHTY MISSUS THOMAS WOULD ASK ME HOW I COULD BE SUCH A BAD GIRL
3179-7135-0022 AND I LIVED WITH THEM UNTIL I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD I HELPED LOOK AFTER THE THOMAS CHILDREN
3179-7135-0023 AND I CAN TELL YOU THEY TOOK A LOT OF LOOKING AFTER THEN MISTER THOMAS WAS KILLED FALLING UNDER A TRAIN AND HIS MOTHER OFFERED TO TAKE MISSUS THOMAS AND THE CHILDREN BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT ME
3179-7135-0024 MISTER HAMMOND WORKED A LITTLE SAWMILL UP THERE AND MISSUS HAMMOND HAD EIGHT CHILDREN SHE HAD TWINS THREE TIMES I LIKE BABIES IN MODERATION BUT TWINS THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION IS TOO MUCH
3179-7135-0025 I TOLD MISSUS HAMMOND SO FIRMLY WHEN THE LAST PAIR CAME
3179-7135-0026 I LIVED UP RIVER WITH MISSUS HAMMOND OVER TWO YEARS AND THEN MISTER HAMMOND DIED AND MISSUS HAMMOND BROKE UP HOUSEKEEPING SHE DIVIDED HER CHILDREN AMONG HER RELATIVES AND WENT TO THE STATES I HAD TO GO TO THE ASYLUM AT HOPETON BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD TAKE ME THEY DIDN'T WANT ME AT THE ASYLUM EITHER
3179-7135-0027 NOT A GREAT DEAL I WENT A LITTLE THE LAST YEAR I STAYED WITH MISSUS THOMAS
3179-7135-0028 WE WERE SO FAR FROM A SCHOOL THAT I COULDN'T WALK IT IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A VACATION IN SUMMER SO I COULD ONLY GO IN THE SPRING AND FALL
3179-7135-0029 AND MOST OF THE SEASONS BY JAMES THOMPSON
3179-7135-0030 THAT IS JUST FULL OF THRILLS OF COURSE I WASN'T IN THE FIFTH READER I WAS ONLY IN THE FOURTH
3179-7135-0031 MISSUS THOMAS AND MISSUS HAMMOND GOOD TO YOU ASKED MARILLA LOOKING AT
3179-7135-0032 YOU DON'T MIND VERY MUCH WHEN THEY'RE NOT QUITE ALWAYS
3179-7135-0033 YOU KNOW IT'S VERY TRYING TO HAVE A DRUNKEN HUSBAND YOU SEE AND IT MUST BE VERY TRYING TO HAVE TWINS THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION DON'T YOU THINK BUT I FEEL SURE THEY MEANT TO BE GOOD TO ME
3179-7135-0034 ANNE GAVE HERSELF UP TO A SILENT RAPTURE OVER THE SHORE ROAD AND MARILLA
3179-7135-0035 PITY WAS SUDDENLY STIRRING IN HER HEART FOR THE CHILD
3179-7135-0036 WHAT IF SHE MARILLA SHOULD INDULGE MATTHEW'S UNACCOUNTABLE WHIM AND LET HER STAY HE WAS SET ON IT AND THE CHILD SEEMED A NICE TEACHABLE LITTLE THING SHE'S GOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THOUGHT MARILLA
3179-7135-0037 SHE'S LADYLIKE IT'S LIKELY HER PEOPLE WERE NICE FOLKS THE SHORE ROAD WAS WOODSY AND WILD AND LONESOME ON THE RIGHT HAND SCRUB FIRS
3179-7135-0038 ON THE LEFT WERE THE STEEP RED SANDSTONE CLIFFS SO NEAR THE TRACK IN PLACES THAT A MARE OF LESS STEADINESS THAN THE SORREL MIGHT HAVE TRIED THE NERVES OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND HER DOWN AT THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS WERE HEAPS OF SURF WORN ROCKS
3179-7135-0039 OR LITTLE SANDY COVES INLAID WITH PEBBLES AS WITH OCEAN JEWELS BEYOND LAY THE SEA SHIMMERING AND BLUE AND OVER IT SOARED THE GULLS THEIR PINIONS FLASHING SILVERY IN THE SUNLIGHT
3179-7135-0040 ISN'T THE SEA WONDERFUL SAID ANNE ROUSING FROM A LONG WIDE EYED SILENCE ONCE WHEN I LIVED IN MARYSVILLE MISTER THOMAS HIRED AN EXPRESS WAGON AND TOOK US ALL TO SPEND THE DAY AT THE SHORE TEN MILES AWAY I ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THAT DAY
3179-7135-0041 EVEN IF I HAD TO LOOK AFTER THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME I LIVED IT OVER IN HAPPY DREAMS FOR YEARS BUT THIS SHORE IS NICER THAN THE MARYSVILLE SHORE AREN'T THOSE GULLS SPLENDID WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE A GULL I THINK I WOULD THAT IS IF I COULDN'T BE A HUMAN GIRL
3179-7135-0042 DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE NICE TO WAKE UP AT SUNRISE AND SWOOP DOWN OVER THE WATER AND AWAY OUT OVER THAT LOVELY BLUE ALL DAY
3179-7135-0043 OH I CAN JUST IMAGINE MYSELF DOING IT
