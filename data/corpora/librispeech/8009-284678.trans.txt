8009-284678-0010 HUMMING FOR VIOLET WAS BETTER BUT THE MOMENT SHE SAW THE STRANGER ASLEEP SHE STOPPED HER SINGING ABRUPTLY AND TIPTOED THE REST OF THE WAY THEN AS SUDDENLY SHE TURNED AROUND AND CAME BACK
8009-284678-0011 IT WAS SO GENTLY DONE THAT EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN REALLY ASLEEP HE WOULD NEVER HAVE WAKENED AS IT WAS HE COULD NOT RESIST OPENING ONE EYE THE SLIGHTEST CRACK TO SEE THE BRIGHT CHESTNUT HAIR
