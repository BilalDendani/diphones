836-131106-0027 THE MEN ASTONISHED PULLED AT THEIR OARS AND SPREAD MORE SAIL TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS BY THE AID OF BOTH BUT ALL IN VAIN IVY TWINED ROUND THE OARS AND HINDERED THEIR MOTION AND CLUNG TO THE SAILS WITH HEAVY CLUSTERS OF BERRIES
836-131106-0028 THE GOD HIMSELF HAD A CHAPLET OF VINE LEAVES AND BORE IN HIS HAND A SPEAR WREATHED WITH IVY TIGERS CROUCHED AT HIS FEET AND FORMS OF LYNXES AND SPOTTED PANTHERS PLAYED AROUND HIM THE MEN WERE SEIZED WITH TERROR OR MADNESS
836-131106-0029 SOME LEAPED OVERBOARD OTHERS PREPARING TO DO THE SAME BEHELD THEIR COMPANIONS IN THE WATER UNDERGOING A CHANGE THEIR BODIES BECOMING FLATTENED AND ENDING IN A CROOKED TAIL ONE EXCLAIMED WHAT MIRACLE IS THIS
836-131106-0030 AND AS HE SPOKE HIS MOUTH WIDENED HIS NOSTRILS EXPANDED AND SCALES COVERED ALL HIS BODY ANOTHER ENDEAVORING TO PULL THE OAR FELT HIS HANDS SHRINK UP AND PRESENTLY TO BE NO LONGER HANDS BUT FINS
836-131106-0031 FOUND HE HAD NO ARMS AND CURVING HIS MUTILATED BODY JUMPED INTO THE SEA WHAT HAD BEEN HIS LEGS BECAME THE TWO ENDS OF A CRESCENT SHAPED TAIL THE WHOLE CREW BECAME DOLPHINS AND SWAM ABOUT THE SHIP
836-131106-0032 NOW UPON THE SURFACE NOW UNDER IT SCATTERING THE SPRAY AND SPOUTING THE WATER FROM THEIR BROAD NOSTRILS OF TWENTY MEN I ALONE WAS LEFT TREMBLING WITH FEAR THE GOD CHEERED ME FEAR NOT SAID HE STEER TOWARDS NAXOS
836-131106-0033 I OBEYED AND WHEN WE ARRIVED THERE I KINDLED THE ALTARS AND CELEBRATED THE SACRED RITES OF BACCHUS PENTHEUS HERE EXCLAIMED WE HAVE WASTED TIME ENOUGH ON THIS SILLY STORY TAKE HIM AWAY AND HAVE HIM EXECUTED WITHOUT DELAY
836-131106-0034 BUT WHILE THEY WERE GETTING READY THE INSTRUMENTS OF EXECUTION THE PRISON DOORS CAME OPEN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND THE CHAINS FELL FROM HIS LIMBS AND WHEN THEY LOOKED FOR HIM HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND PENTHEUS WOULD TAKE NO WARNING
836-131106-0035 HE PENETRATED THROUGH THE WOOD AND REACHED AN OPEN SPACE WHERE THE CHIEF SCENE OF THE ORGIES MET HIS EYES AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WOMEN SAW HIM
836-131106-0036 BLINDED BY THE GOD CRIED OUT SEE THERE THE WILD BOAR THE HUGEST MONSTER THAT PROWLS IN THESE WOODS COME ON SISTERS I WILL BE THE FIRST TO STRIKE THE WILD BOAR THE WHOLE BAND RUSHED UPON HIM AND WHILE HE NOW TALKS LESS ARROGANTLY
836-131106-0037 NOW EXCUSES HIMSELF AND NOW CONFESSES HIS CRIME AND IMPLORES PARDON THEY PRESS UPON HIM AND WOUND HIM IN VAIN HE CRIES TO HIS AUNTS TO PROTECT HIM FROM HIS MOTHER AUTONOE SEIZED ONE ARM INO THE OTHER
836-131106-0038 AND BETWEEN THEM HE WAS TORN TO PIECES WHILE HIS MOTHER SHOUTED VICTORY VICTORY WE HAVE DONE IT THE GLORY IS OURS SO THE WORSHIP OF BACCHUS WAS ESTABLISHED IN GREECE
836-131106-0039 THERE IS AN ALLUSION TO THE STORY OF BACCHUS AND THE MARINERS IN MILTON'S COMUS AT LINE FORTY SIX
836-131106-0040 BACCHUS THAT FIRST FROM OUT THE PURPLE GRAPES CRUSHED THE SWEET POISON OF MISUSED WINE AFTER THE TUSCAN MANNERS TRANSFORMED COASTING THE TYRRHENE SHORE AS THE WINDS LISTED ON CIRCE'S ISLAND FELL
836-131106-0041 WHOSE CHARMED CUP WHOEVER TASTED LOST HIS UPRIGHT SHAPE AND DOWNWARD FELL INTO A GROVELLING SWINE ARIADNE
836-131106-0042 WE HAVE SEEN IN THE STORY OF THESEUS HOW ARIADNE THE DAUGHTER OF KING MINOS AFTER HELPING THESEUS TO ESCAPE FROM THE LABYRINTH WAS CARRIED BY HIM TO THE ISLAND OF NAXOS
836-131106-0043 AND WAS LEFT THERE ASLEEP WHILE THE UNGRATEFUL THESEUS PURSUED HIS WAY HOME WITHOUT HER ARIADNE ON WAKING AND FINDING HERSELF DESERTED ABANDONED HERSELF TO GRIEF BUT VENUS TOOK PITY ON HER AND CONSOLED HER WITH THE PROMISE
836-131106-0044 THE ISLAND WHERE ARIADNE WAS LEFT WAS THE FAVORITE ISLAND OF BACCHUS THE SAME THAT HE WISHED
836-131106-0045 WHEN THEY SO TREACHEROUSLY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE PRIZE OF HIM AS ARIADNE SAT LAMENTING HER FATE BACCHUS FOUND HER CONSOLED HER AND MADE HER HIS WIFE AS A MARRIAGE PRESENT HE GAVE HER A GOLDEN CROWN ENRICHED WITH GEMS
836-131106-0046 BETWEEN THE KNEELING HERCULES AND THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE SERPENT SPENSER ALLUDES TO ARIADNE'S CROWN THOUGH HE HAS MADE SOME MISTAKES IN HIS MYTHOLOGY IT WAS AT THE WEDDING OF PIRITHOUS AND NOT THESEUS
836-131106-0047 THAT THE CENTAURS AND LAPITHAE QUARRELLED LOOK HOW THE CROWN WHICH ARIADNE WORE UPON HER IVORY FOREHEAD THAT SAME DAY THAT THESEUS HER UNTO HIS BRIDAL BORE
