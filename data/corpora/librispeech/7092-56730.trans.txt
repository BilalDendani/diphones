7092-56730-0000 CICERO SAYS
7092-56730-0001 THIRTY ONE THAT TO STUDY PHILOSOPHY IS NOTHING BUT TO PREPARE ONE'S SELF TO DIE THE REASON OF WHICH IS
7092-56730-0002 AND EMPLOY IT SEPARATELY FROM THE BODY WHICH IS A KIND OF APPRENTICESHIP AND A RESEMBLANCE OF DEATH OR ELSE BECAUSE ALL THE WISDOM AND REASONING IN THE WORLD DO IN THE END CONCLUDE IN THIS POINT TO TEACH US NOT TO FEAR TO DIE
7092-56730-0003 AND TO SAY THE TRUTH EITHER OUR REASON MOCKS US OR IT OUGHT TO HAVE NO OTHER AIM BUT OUR CONTENTMENT ONLY NOR TO ENDEAVOUR ANYTHING BUT IN SUM TO MAKE US LIVE WELL AND AS THE HOLY SCRIPTURE SAYS
7092-56730-0004 AT OUR EASE ALL THE OPINIONS OF THE WORLD AGREE IN THIS THAT PLEASURE IS OUR END THOUGH WE MAKE USE OF DIVERS MEANS TO ATTAIN IT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE REJECTED AT THE FIRST MOTION
7092-56730-0005 FOR WHO WOULD GIVE EAR TO HIM THAT SHOULD PROPOSE AFFLICTION AND MISERY FOR HIS END THE CONTROVERSIES AND DISPUTES OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL SECTS UPON THIS POINT ARE MERELY VERBAL TRANSCURRAMUS SOLERTISSIMAS
7092-56730-0006 NUGAS LET US SKIP OVER THOSE SUBTLE TRIFLES
7092-56730-0007 THERE IS MORE IN THEM OF OPPOSITION AND OBSTINACY THAN IS CONSISTENT WITH SO SACRED A PROFESSION BUT WHATSOEVER PERSONAGE A MAN TAKES UPON HIMSELF TO PERFORM HE EVER MIXES HIS OWN PART WITH IT
7092-56730-0008 LET THE PHILOSOPHERS SAY WHAT THEY WILL THE THING AT WHICH WE ALL AIM EVEN IN VIRTUE IS PLEASURE IT AMUSES ME TO RATTLE IN EARS THIS WORD WHICH THEY SO NAUSEATE TO AND IF IT SIGNIFY SOME SUPREME PLEASURE AND CONTENTMENT
7092-56730-0009 IT IS MORE DUE TO THE ASSISTANCE OF VIRTUE THAN TO ANY OTHER ASSISTANCE WHATEVER
7092-56730-0010 IS ONLY THE MORE SERIOUSLY VOLUPTUOUS
7092-56730-0011 AS THAT WHICH IS MORE FAVOURABLE GENTLE AND NATURAL AND NOT THAT FROM WHICH WE HAVE DENOMINATED IT THE OTHER AND MEANER PLEASURE IF IT COULD DESERVE THIS FAIR NAME IT OUGHT TO BE BY WAY OF COMPETITION AND NOT OF PRIVILEGE
7092-56730-0012 I FIND IT LESS EXEMPT FROM TRAVERSES AND INCONVENIENCES THAN VIRTUE ITSELF AND BESIDES THAT THE ENJOYMENT IS MORE MOMENTARY FLUID AND FRAIL IT HAS ITS WATCHINGS FASTS AND LABOURS ITS SWEAT AND ITS BLOOD
7092-56730-0013 AND MOREOVER HAS PARTICULAR TO ITSELF SO MANY SEVERAL SORTS OF SHARP AND WOUNDING PASSIONS AND SO DULL A SATIETY ATTENDING IT AS EQUAL IT TO THE SEVEREST PENANCE
7092-56730-0014 AS IN NATURE ONE CONTRARY IS QUICKENED BY ANOTHER OR SAY WHEN WE COME TO VIRTUE THAT LIKE CONSEQUENCES AND DIFFICULTIES OVERWHELM AND RENDER IT AUSTERE AND INACCESSIBLE WHEREAS
7092-56730-0015 MUCH MORE APTLY THAN IN VOLUPTUOUSNESS THEY ENNOBLE SHARPEN AND HEIGHTEN THE PERFECT AND DIVINE PLEASURE THEY PROCURE US HE RENDERS HIMSELF UNWORTHY OF IT WHO WILL COUNTERPOISE ITS COST WITH ITS FRUIT
7092-56730-0016 AND NEITHER UNDERSTANDS THE BLESSING NOR HOW TO USE IT THOSE WHO PREACH TO US THAT THE QUEST OF IT IS CRAGGY DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL BUT ITS FRUITION PLEASANT WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY THAT BUT TO TELL US THAT IT IS ALWAYS UNPLEASING
7092-56730-0017 FOR WHAT HUMAN MEANS WILL EVER ATTAIN ITS ENJOYMENT THE MOST PERFECT HAVE BEEN FAIN TO CONTENT THEMSELVES TO ASPIRE UNTO IT AND TO APPROACH IT ONLY WITHOUT EVER POSSESSING IT BUT THEY ARE DECEIVED
7092-56730-0018 SEEING THAT OF ALL THE PLEASURES WE KNOW THE VERY PURSUIT IS PLEASANT THE ATTEMPT EVER RELISHES OF THE QUALITY OF THE THING TO WHICH IT IS DIRECTED FOR IT IS A GOOD PART OF AND CONSUBSTANTIAL WITH THE EFFECT
7092-56730-0019 THE FELICITY AND BEATITUDE THAT GLITTERS IN VIRTUE SHINES THROUGHOUT ALL HER APPURTENANCES AND AVENUES EVEN TO THE FIRST ENTRY AND UTMOST LIMITS NOW
7092-56730-0020 OF ALL THE BENEFITS THAT VIRTUE CONFERS UPON US THE CONTEMPT OF DEATH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AS THE MEANS THAT ACCOMMODATES HUMAN LIFE WITH A SOFT AND EASY TRANQUILLITY AND GIVES US A PURE AND PLEASANT TASTE OF LIVING
7092-56730-0021 WITHOUT WHICH ALL OTHER PLEASURE WOULD BE EXTINCT WHICH IS THE REASON WHY ALL THE RULES CENTRE AND CONCUR IN THIS ONE ARTICLE AND ALTHOUGH THEY ALL IN LIKE MANNER WITH COMMON ACCORD TEACH US ALSO TO DESPISE PAIN
7092-56730-0022 THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND PASSING OVER THEIR WHOLE LIVES WITHOUT EVER KNOWING WHAT POVERTY IS AND SOME WITHOUT SORROW OR SICKNESS AS XENOPHILUS THE MUSICIAN WHO LIVED A HUNDRED AND SIX YEARS IN A PERFECT AND CONTINUAL HEALTH
7092-56730-0023 AS ALSO BECAUSE AT THE WORST DEATH CAN WHENEVER WE PLEASE CUT SHORT AND PUT AN END TO ALL OTHER INCONVENIENCES BUT AS TO DEATH IT IS INEVITABLE OMNES EODEM COGIMUR
7092-56730-0024 OMNIUM VERSATUR URNA
7092-56730-0025 WE ARE ALL BOUND ONE VOYAGE THE LOT OF ALL SOONER OR LATER IS TO COME OUT OF THE URN ALL MUST TO ETERNAL EXILE SAIL AWAY
7092-56730-0026 AND CONSEQUENTLY IF IT FRIGHTS US TIS A PERPETUAL TORMENT FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SORT OF CONSOLATION THERE IS NO WAY BY WHICH IT MAY NOT REACH US WE MAY CONTINUALLY TURN OUR HEADS THIS WAY AND THAT
7092-56730-0027 AS IN A SUSPECTED COUNTRY QUAE QUASI SAXUM TANTALO SEMPER IMPENDET EVER
7092-56730-0028 HANGS OVER US CICERO
7092-56730-0029 EIGHTEEN OUR COURTS OF JUSTICE OFTEN SEND BACK CONDEMNED CRIMINALS TO BE EXECUTED UPON THE PLACE WHERE THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BUT CARRY THEM TO FINE HOUSES BY THE WAY PREPARE FOR THEM THE BEST ENTERTAINMENT YOU CAN
7092-56730-0030 SOMNUM REDUCENT SICILIAN DAINTIES WILL NOT TICKLE THEIR PALATES NOR THE MELODY OF BIRDS AND HARPS BRING BACK SLEEP
7092-56730-0031 AND TORMENTS HIMSELF BY THINKING OF THE BLOW TO COME CLAUDIANUS IN RUF II ONE
7092-56730-0032 THE END OF OUR RACE IS DEATH TIS THE NECESSARY OBJECT OF OUR AIM WHICH IF IT FRIGHT US
7092-56730-0033 THE REMEDY THE VULGAR USE IS NOT TO THINK ON'T BUT FROM WHAT BRUTISH STUPIDITY CAN THEY DERIVE SO GROSS A BLINDNESS THEY MUST BRIDLE THE ASS BY THE TAIL
7092-56730-0034 WHO IN HIS FOLLY SEEKS TO ADVANCE BACKWARDS
7092-56730-0035 TIS NO WONDER IF HE BE OFTEN TRAPPED IN THE PITFALL THEY AFFRIGHT PEOPLE WITH THE VERY MENTION OF DEATH AND MANY CROSS THEMSELVES AS IT WERE THE NAME OF THE DEVIL AND BECAUSE THE MAKING A MAN'S WILL IS IN REFERENCE TO DYING
7092-56730-0036 NOT A MAN WILL BE PERSUADED TO TAKE A PEN IN HAND TO THAT PURPOSE TILL THE PHYSICIAN HAS PASSED SENTENCE UPON AND TOTALLY GIVEN HIM OVER AND THEN BETWIXT AND TERROR GOD KNOWS IN HOW FIT A CONDITION
7092-56730-0037 OF UNDERSTANDING HE IS TO DO IT THE ROMANS BY REASON THAT THIS POOR SYLLABLE DEATH SOUNDED SO HARSHLY TO THEIR EARS AND SEEMED SO OMINOUS
7092-56730-0038 THE LATE MONSIEUR SUCH AND SUCH A ONE
7092-56730-0039 I WAS BORN BETWIXT ELEVEN AND TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON THE LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY FIFTEEN THIRTY THREE ACCORDING TO OUR COMPUTATION
7092-56730-0040 PREVIOUSLY THE YEAR COMMENCED AT EASTER
7092-56730-0041 AND IT IS NOW BUT JUST FIFTEEN DAYS SINCE I WAS COMPLETE NINE AND THIRTY YEARS OLD I MAKE ACCOUNT TO LIVE AT LEAST AS MANY MORE IN THE MEANTIME TO TROUBLE A MAN'S SELF WITH THE THOUGHT OF A THING SO FAR OFF WERE FOLLY
7092-56730-0042 BUT WHAT YOUNG AND OLD DIE UPON THE SAME TERMS NO ONE DEPARTS OUT OF LIFE OTHERWISE THAN IF HE HAD BUT JUST BEFORE ENTERED INTO IT NEITHER IS ANY MAN SO OLD AND DECREPIT WHO
7092-56730-0043 HAVING HEARD OF METHUSELAH DOES NOT THINK HE HAS YET TWENTY GOOD YEARS TO COME FOOL THAT THOU ART
7092-56730-0044 RATHER CONSULT EFFECTS AND EXPERIENCE ACCORDING TO THE COMMON COURSE OF THINGS TIS LONG SINCE THAT THOU HAST LIVED BY EXTRAORDINARY FAVOUR THOU HAST ALREADY OUTLIVED THE ORDINARY TERM OF LIFE AND THAT IT IS SO
7092-56730-0045 RECKON UP THY ACQUAINTANCE HOW MANY MORE HAVE DIED BEFORE THEY ARRIVED AT THY AGE THAN HAVE ATTAINED UNTO IT
7092-56730-0046 HOW MANY SEVERAL WAYS HAS DEATH TO SURPRISE US
7092-56730-0047 BE AS CAUTIOUS AS HE MAY
7092-56730-0048 WHILST CAIUS JULIUS THE PHYSICIAN WAS ANOINTING THE EYES OF A PATIENT DEATH CLOSED HIS OWN AND IF I MAY BRING IN AN EXAMPLE OF MY OWN BLOOD A BROTHER OF MINE CAPTAIN SAINT MARTIN A YOUNG MAN
7092-56730-0049 PLAYING A MATCH AT TENNIS RECEIVED A BLOW OF A BALL A LITTLE ABOVE HIS RIGHT EAR WHICH AS IT GAVE NO MANNER OF SIGN OF WOUND OR CONTUSION HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF IT NOR SO MUCH AS SAT DOWN TO REPOSE HIMSELF BUT NEVERTHELESS
7092-56730-0050 DIED WITHIN FIVE OR SIX HOURS AFTER OF AN APOPLEXY OCCASIONED BY THAT BLOW THESE SO FREQUENT AND COMMON EXAMPLES PASSING EVERY DAY BEFORE OUR EYES
7092-56730-0051 HOW IS IT POSSIBLE A MAN SHOULD DISENGAGE HIMSELF FROM THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OR AVOID FANCYING THAT IT HAS US EVERY MOMENT BY THE THROAT WHAT MATTER IS IT YOU WILL SAY WHICH WAY IT COMES TO PASS
7092-56730-0052 PROVIDED A MAN DOES NOT TERRIFY HIMSELF WITH THE EXPECTATION FOR MY PART I AM OF THIS MIND AND IF A MAN COULD BY ANY MEANS AVOID IT THOUGH BY CREEPING UNDER A CALF'S SKIN I AM ONE
7092-56730-0053 BUT TIS FOLLY TO THINK OF DOING ANYTHING THAT WAY THEY GO THEY COME THEY GALLOP AND DANCE AND NOT A WORD OF DEATH ALL THIS IS VERY FINE BUT WITHAL WHEN IT COMES EITHER TO THEMSELVES THEIR WIVES THEIR CHILDREN OR FRIENDS
7092-56730-0054 SURPRISING THEM AT UNAWARES AND UNPREPARED THEN WHAT TORMENT WHAT OUTCRIES WHAT MADNESS AND DESPAIR DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING SO SUBDUED SO CHANGED AND SO CONFOUNDED A MAN MUST THEREFORE MAKE MORE EARLY PROVISION FOR IT
7092-56730-0055 AND THIS BRUTISH NEGLIGENCE COULD IT POSSIBLY LODGE IN THE BRAIN OF ANY MAN OF SENSE
7092-56730-0056 AND TO BEGIN TO DEPRIVE HIM OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE HE HAS OVER US LET US TAKE A WAY QUITE CONTRARY TO THE COMMON COURSE LET US DISARM HIM OF HIS NOVELTY AND STRANGENESS LET US CONVERSE AND BE FAMILIAR WITH HIM
7092-56730-0057 AND HAVE NOTHING SO FREQUENT IN OUR THOUGHTS AS DEATH UPON ALL OCCASIONS REPRESENT HIM TO OUR IMAGINATION IN HIS EVERY SHAPE AT THE STUMBLING OF A HORSE AT THE FALLING OF A TILE AT THE LEAST PRICK WITH A PIN
7092-56730-0058 LET US PRESENTLY CONSIDER AND SAY TO OURSELVES WELL AND WHAT IF IT HAD BEEN DEATH ITSELF AND THEREUPON LET US ENCOURAGE AND FORTIFY OURSELVES LET US EVERMORE AMIDST OUR JOLLITY AND FEASTING
7092-56730-0059 SET THE REMEMBRANCE OF OUR FRAIL CONDITION BEFORE OUR EYES NEVER SUFFERING OURSELVES TO BE SO FAR TRANSPORTED WITH OUR DELIGHTS BUT THAT WE HAVE SOME INTERVALS OF REFLECTING UPON AND CONSIDERING HOW MANY SEVERAL WAYS THIS JOLLITY OF OURS TENDS TO DEATH
7092-56730-0060 AND WITH HOW MANY DANGERS IT THREATENS IT THE EGYPTIANS WERE WONT TO DO AFTER THIS MANNER WHO IN THE HEIGHT OF THEIR FEASTING AND MIRTH CAUSED A DRIED SKELETON OF A MAN TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM TO SERVE FOR A MEMENTO TO THEIR GUESTS
7092-56730-0061 GRATA SUPERVENIET QUAE
7092-56730-0062 THINK EACH DAY WHEN PAST IS THY LAST THE NEXT DAY AS UNEXPECTED
7092-56730-0063 WHERE DEATH WAITS FOR US IS UNCERTAIN LET US LOOK FOR HIM EVERYWHERE THE PREMEDITATION OF DEATH IS THE PREMEDITATION OF LIBERTY HE WHO HAS LEARNED TO DIE HAS UNLEARNED TO SERVE
7092-56730-0064 THERE IS NOTHING EVIL IN LIFE FOR HIM WHO RIGHTLY COMPREHENDS THAT THE PRIVATION OF LIFE IS NO EVIL TO KNOW HOW TO DIE DELIVERS US FROM ALL SUBJECTION AND CONSTRAINT
7092-56730-0065 SURPRISED A FEW DAYS BEFORE WITH A BURNING FEVER OF WHICH HE DIED RETURNING FROM AN ENTERTAINMENT LIKE THIS WITH HIS HEAD FULL OF IDLE FANCIES OF LOVE AND JOLLITY AS MINE WAS THEN AND THAT FOR AUGHT I KNEW THE SAME DESTINY WAS ATTENDING ME
7092-56730-0066 PRESENTLY THE PRESENT WILL HAVE GONE NEVER TO BE RECALLED LUCRETIUS III
7092-56730-0067 YET DID NOT THIS THOUGHT WRINKLE MY FOREHEAD ANY MORE THAN ANY OTHER IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT WE MUST FEEL A STING IN SUCH IMAGINATIONS AS THESE AT FIRST BUT WITH OFTEN TURNING AND RETURNING THEM IN ONE'S MIND THEY AT LAST
7092-56730-0068 BECOME SO FAMILIAR AS TO BE NO TROUBLE AT ALL OTHERWISE I FOR MY PART SHOULD BE IN A PERPETUAL FRIGHT AND FRENZY FOR NEVER MAN WAS SO DISTRUSTFUL OF HIS LIFE NEVER MAN SO UNCERTAIN AS TO ITS DURATION
7092-56730-0069 NEITHER HEALTH WHICH I HAVE HITHERTO EVER ENJOYED VERY STRONG AND VIGOROUS AND VERY SELDOM INTERRUPTED DOES PROLONG NOR SICKNESS CONTRACT MY HOPES EVERY MINUTE METHINKS I AM ESCAPING
7092-56730-0070 AND IT ETERNALLY RUNS IN MY MIND THAT WHAT MAY BE DONE TO MORROW MAY BE DONE TO DAY HAZARDS AND DANGERS DO IN TRUTH LITTLE OR NOTHING HASTEN OUR END AND IF WE CONSIDER HOW MANY THOUSANDS MORE REMAIN AND HANG OVER OUR HEADS
7092-56730-0071 BESIDES THE ACCIDENT THAT IMMEDIATELY THREATENS US WE SHALL FIND THAT THE SOUND AND THE SICK THOSE THAT ARE ABROAD AT SEA AND THOSE THAT SIT BY THE FIRE THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BATTLE AND THOSE WHO SIT IDLE AT HOME ARE THE ONE AS NEAR IT AS THE OTHER
7092-56730-0072 NO MAN IS MORE FRAGILE THAN ANOTHER NO MAN MORE CERTAIN THAN ANOTHER OF TO MORROW SENECA
7092-56730-0073 FOR ANYTHING I HAVE TO DO BEFORE I DIE THE LONGEST LEISURE WOULD APPEAR TOO SHORT WERE IT BUT AN HOUR'S BUSINESS I HAD TO DO A FRIEND OF MINE THE OTHER DAY TURNING OVER MY TABLETS FOUND THEREIN A MEMORANDUM OF SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE DONE AFTER MY DECEASE
7092-56730-0074 WHEREUPON I TOLD HIM AS IT WAS REALLY TRUE THAT THOUGH I WAS NO MORE THAN A LEAGUE'S DISTANCE ONLY FROM MY OWN HOUSE AND MERRY AND WELL
7092-56730-0075 BECAUSE I WAS NOT CERTAIN TO LIVE TILL I CAME HOME AS A MAN THAT AM ETERNALLY BROODING OVER MY OWN THOUGHTS AND CONFINE THEM TO MY OWN PARTICULAR CONCERNS I AM AT ALL HOURS AS WELL PREPARED AS I AM EVER LIKE TO BE AND DEATH WHENEVER HE SHALL COME
7092-56730-0076 CAN BRING NOTHING ALONG WITH HIM I DID NOT EXPECT LONG BEFORE WE SHOULD ALWAYS AS NEAR AS WE CAN BE BOOTED AND SPURRED AND READY TO GO AND ABOVE ALL THINGS TAKE CARE AT THAT TIME TO HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH ANY ONE BUT ONE'S SELF
7092-56730-0077 WHY FOR SO SHORT A LIFE TEASE OURSELVES WITH SO MANY PROJECTS
7092-56730-0078 FOR WE SHALL THERE FIND WORK ENOUGH TO DO WITHOUT ANY NEED OF ADDITION ONE MAN COMPLAINS MORE THAN OF DEATH THAT HE IS THEREBY PREVENTED OF A GLORIOUS VICTORY
7092-56730-0079 FOR MY PART I AM THANKS BE TO GOD AT THIS INSTANT IN SUCH A CONDITION THAT I AM READY TO DISLODGE WHENEVER IT SHALL PLEASE HIM WITHOUT REGRET FOR ANYTHING WHATSOEVER
7092-56730-0080 I DISENGAGE MYSELF THROUGHOUT FROM ALL WORLDLY RELATIONS MY LEAVE IS SOON TAKEN OF ALL BUT MYSELF NEVER DID ANY ONE PREPARE TO BID ADIEU TO THE WORLD MORE ABSOLUTELY AND UNRESERVEDLY
7092-56730-0081 AND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ALL MANNER OF INTEREST IN IT THAN I EXPECT TO DO THE DEADEST DEATHS ARE THE BEST
7092-56730-0082 WRETCH THAT I AM THEY CRY ONE FATAL DAY HAS DEPRIVED ME OF ALL JOYS OF LIFE
7092-56730-0083 AND THE BUILDER
7092-56730-0084 A MAN MUST DESIGN NOTHING THAT WILL REQUIRE SO MUCH TIME TO THE FINISHING OR AT LEAST WITH NO SUCH PASSIONATE DESIRE TO SEE IT BROUGHT TO PERFECTION WE ARE BORN TO ACTION
7092-56730-0085 LET IT BE DOING THAT I HAD DESIGNED
7092-56730-0086 I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A MAN TO BE DOING AND AS MUCH AS IN HIM LIES TO EXTEND AND SPIN OUT THE OFFICES OF LIFE AND THEN LET DEATH TAKE ME PLANTING MY CABBAGES INDIFFERENT TO HIM AND STILL LESS OF MY GARDENS NOT BEING FINISHED
7092-56730-0087 I SAW ONE DIE WHO AT HIS LAST GASP COMPLAINED OF NOTHING SO MUCH AS THAT DESTINY WAS ABOUT TO CUT THE THREAD OF A CHRONICLE HE WAS THEN COMPILING WHEN HE WAS GONE NO FARTHER THAN THE FIFTEENTH OR SIXTEENTH OF OUR KINGS
7092-56730-0088 IN HIS REBUS NON ADDUNT
7092-56730-0089 UNA THEY DO NOT ADD THAT DYING WE HAVE NO LONGER A DESIRE TO POSSESS THINGS
7092-56730-0090 WE ARE TO DISCHARGE OURSELVES FROM THESE VULGAR AND HURTFUL HUMOURS TO THIS PURPOSE IT WAS THAT MEN FIRST APPOINTED THE PLACES OF SEPULTURE ADJOINING THE CHURCHES AND IN THE MOST FREQUENTED PLACES OF THE CITY
7092-56730-0091 TO ACCUSTOM SAYS LYCURGUS THE COMMON PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE STARTLED AT THE SIGHT OF A CORPSE AND TO THE END THAT THE CONTINUAL SPECTACLE OF BONES GRAVES AND FUNERAL OBSEQUIES SHOULD PUT US IN MIND OF OUR FRAIL CONDITION
7092-56730-0092 EPULIS SPECTACULA DIRA
7092-56730-0093 MENSIS IT WAS FORMERLY THE CUSTOM TO ENLIVEN BANQUETS WITH SLAUGHTER AND TO COMBINE WITH THE REPAST THE DIRE SPECTACLE OF MEN CONTENDING WITH THE SWORD
7092-56730-0094 SILIUS ITALICUS
7092-56730-0095 FIFTY ONE AND AS THE EGYPTIANS AFTER THEIR FEASTS WERE WONT TO PRESENT THE COMPANY WITH A GREAT IMAGE OF DEATH BY ONE THAT CRIED OUT TO THEM DRINK AND BE MERRY FOR SUCH SHALT THOU BE WHEN THOU ART DEAD
7092-56730-0096 SO IT IS MY CUSTOM TO HAVE DEATH NOT ONLY IN MY IMAGINATION BUT CONTINUALLY IN MY MOUTH NEITHER IS THERE ANYTHING OF WHICH I AM SO INQUISITIVE AND DELIGHT TO INFORM MYSELF AS THE MANNER OF MEN'S DEATHS THEIR WORDS LOOKS AND BEARING
7092-56730-0097 AND IT IS MANIFEST ENOUGH BY MY CROWDING IN EXAMPLES OF THIS KIND THAT I HAVE A PARTICULAR FANCY FOR THAT SUBJECT IF I WERE A WRITER OF BOOKS I WOULD COMPILE A REGISTER WITH A COMMENT OF THE VARIOUS DEATHS OF MEN HE WHO SHOULD TEACH MEN TO DIE
7092-56730-0098 WOULD AT THE SAME TIME TEACH THEM TO LIVE DICARCHUS MADE ONE TO WHICH HE GAVE THAT TITLE BUT IT WAS DESIGNED FOR ANOTHER AND LESS PROFITABLE END PERADVENTURE SOME ONE MAY OBJECT THAT THE PAIN AND TERROR OF DYING
7092-56730-0099 SO INFINITELY EXCEED ALL MANNER OF IMAGINATION
7092-56730-0100 TO PREMEDITATE IS DOUBTLESS A VERY GREAT ADVANTAGE AND BESIDES IS IT NOTHING TO GO SO FAR AT LEAST WITHOUT DISTURBANCE OR ALTERATION MOREOVER NATURE HERSELF ASSISTS AND ENCOURAGES US
7092-56730-0101 IF THE DEATH BE SUDDEN AND VIOLENT WE HAVE NOT LEISURE TO FEAR IF OTHERWISE I PERCEIVE THAT AS I ENGAGE FURTHER IN MY DISEASE
7092-56730-0102 I FIND I HAVE MUCH MORE ADO TO DIGEST THIS RESOLUTION OF DYING WHEN I AM WELL IN HEALTH THAN WHEN LANGUISHING OF A FEVER AND BY HOW MUCH I HAVE LESS TO DO WITH THE COMMODITIES OF LIFE
7092-56730-0103 BY REASON THAT I BEGIN TO LOSE THE USE AND PLEASURE OF THEM BY SO MUCH I LOOK UPON DEATH WITH LESS TERROR WHICH MAKES ME HOPE
7092-56730-0104 I SHALL THE MORE EASILY EXCHANGE THE ONE FOR THE OTHER AND AS I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN OTHER OCCURRENCES THAT AS CAESAR SAYS
7092-56730-0105 I HAVE FOUND THAT BEING WELL I HAVE HAD MALADIES IN MUCH GREATER HORROR THAN WHEN REALLY AFFLICTED WITH THEM
7092-56730-0106 THAT BY IMAGINATION I MAGNIFY THOSE INCONVENIENCES BY ONE HALF AND APPREHEND THEM TO BE MUCH MORE TROUBLESOME THAN I FIND THEM REALLY TO BE WHEN THEY LIE THE MOST HEAVY UPON ME I HOPE TO FIND DEATH THE SAME
7092-56730-0107 HOW NATURE DEPRIVES US OF THE LIGHT AND SENSE OF OUR BODILY DECAY WHAT REMAINS TO AN OLD MAN OF THE VIGOUR OF HIS YOUTH AND BETTER DAYS
7092-56730-0108 SIXTEEN CAESAR TO AN OLD WEATHER BEATEN SOLDIER OF HIS GUARDS WHO CAME TO ASK HIM LEAVE THAT HE MIGHT KILL HIMSELF TAKING NOTICE OF HIS WITHERED BODY AND DECREPIT MOTION PLEASANTLY ANSWERED
7092-56730-0109 THOU FANCIEST THEN THAT THOU ART YET ALIVE SENECA
7092-56730-0110 I DO NOT THINK HUMANITY CAPABLE OF ENDURING SUCH A CHANGE BUT NATURE LEADING US BY THE HAND AN EASY AND AS IT WERE AN INSENSIBLE PACE STEP BY STEP CONDUCTS US TO THAT MISERABLE STATE
7092-56730-0111 AND BY THAT MEANS MAKES IT FAMILIAR TO US SO THAT WE ARE INSENSIBLE OF THE STROKE WHEN OUR YOUTH DIES IN US THOUGH IT BE REALLY A HARDER DEATH THAN THE FINAL DISSOLUTION OF A LANGUISHING BODY THAN THE DEATH OF OLD AGE
7092-56730-0112 FORASMUCH AS THE FALL IS NOT SO GREAT FROM AN UNEASY BEING TO NONE AT ALL
7092-56730-0113 THE BODY BENT AND BOWED HAS LESS FORCE TO SUPPORT A BURDEN AND IT IS THE SAME WITH THE SOUL AND THEREFORE IT IS THAT WE ARE TO RAISE HER UP FIRM AND ERECT AGAINST THE POWER OF THIS ADVERSARY FOR
7092-56730-0114 SO IF SHE ONCE CAN ASSURE HERSELF SHE MAY BOAST WHICH IS A THING AS IT WERE SURPASSING HUMAN CONDITION THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT DISQUIET
7092-56730-0115 ANXIETY OR FEAR OR ANY OTHER DISTURBANCE SHOULD INHABIT OR HAVE ANY PLACE IN HER NON VULNUS INSTANTS TYRANNI
7092-56730-0116 NOT THE MENACING LOOK OF A TYRANT SHAKES HER WELL SETTLED SOUL NOR TURBULENT AUSTER THE PRINCE OF THE STORMY ADRIATIC NOR YET THE STRONG HAND OF THUNDERING JOVE SUCH A TEMPER MOVES
7092-56730-0117 SHE IS THEN BECOME SOVEREIGN OF ALL HER LUSTS AND PASSIONS
7092-56730-0118 LET US THEREFORE AS MANY OF US AS CAN GET THIS ADVANTAGE
7092-56730-0119 FOR WHY SHOULD WE FEAR TO LOSE A THING WHICH BEING LOST CANNOT BE LAMENTED BUT ALSO SEEING WE ARE THREATENED BY SO MANY SORTS OF DEATH
7092-56730-0120 THAN ONCE TO UNDERGO ONE OF THEM AND WHAT MATTERS IT
7092-56730-0121 SO IN OUR DEATH IS THE DEATH OF ALL THINGS INCLUDED AND THEREFORE TO LAMENT THAT WE SHALL NOT BE ALIVE A HUNDRED YEARS HENCE IS THE SAME FOLLY AS TO BE SORRY WE WERE NOT ALIVE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO DEATH IS THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER LIFE
7092-56730-0122 SO DID WE WEEP AND SO MUCH IT COST US TO ENTER INTO THIS AND SO DID WE PUT OFF OUR FORMER VEIL IN ENTERING INTO IT NOTHING CAN BE A GRIEVANCE THAT IS BUT ONCE
7092-56730-0123 FOR THERE IS NO LONG NOR SHORT TO THINGS THAT ARE NO MORE ARISTOTLE TELLS US THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LITTLE BEASTS UPON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER HYPANIS THAT NEVER LIVE ABOVE A DAY
7092-56730-0124 THEY WHICH DIE AT EIGHT OF THE CLOCK IN THE MORNING DIE IN THEIR YOUTH
7092-56730-0125 SHALL I EXCHANGE FOR YOU THIS BEAUTIFUL CONTEXTURE OF THINGS TIS THE CONDITION OF YOUR CREATION DEATH IS A PART OF YOU AND WHILST YOU ENDEAVOUR TO EVADE IT YOU EVADE YOURSELVES
7092-56730-0126 THIS VERY BEING OF YOURS THAT YOU NOW ENJOY IS EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWIXT LIFE AND DEATH THE DAY OF YOUR BIRTH IS ONE DAY'S ADVANCE TOWARDS THE GRAVE PRIMA
7092-56730-0127 THE FIRST HOUR THAT GAVE US LIFE TOOK AWAY ALSO AN HOUR
7092-56730-0128 ALL THE WHOLE TIME YOU LIVE YOU PURLOIN FROM LIFE AND LIVE AT THE EXPENSE OF LIFE ITSELF THE PERPETUAL WORK OF YOUR LIFE IS BUT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION OF DEATH YOU ARE IN DEATH WHILST YOU ARE IN LIFE
7092-56730-0129 BECAUSE YOU STILL ARE AFTER DEATH WHEN YOU ARE NO MORE ALIVE OR IF YOU HAD RATHER HAVE IT SO YOU ARE DEAD AFTER LIFE BUT DYING ALL THE WHILE YOU LIVE AND DEATH HANDLES THE DYING MUCH MORE RUDELY THAN THE DEAD
7092-56730-0130 AND MORE SENSIBLY AND ESSENTIALLY
7092-56730-0131 YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT GO YOUR WAY SATISFIED
7092-56730-0132 WHY NOT DEPART FROM LIFE AS A SATED GUEST FROM A FEAST
7092-56730-0133 IF YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN HOW TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF IT
7092-56730-0134 LIFE IN ITSELF IS NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL IT IS THE SCENE OF GOOD OR EVIL AS YOU MAKE IT AND IF YOU HAVE LIVED A DAY YOU HAVE SEEN ALL ONE DAY IS EQUAL AND LIKE TO ALL OTHER DAYS
7092-56730-0135 THIS VERY SUN THIS MOON THESE VERY STARS THIS VERY ORDER AND DISPOSITION OF THINGS IS THE SAME YOUR ANCESTORS ENJOYED AND THAT SHALL ALSO ENTERTAIN YOUR POSTERITY
7092-56730-0136 YOUR GRANDSIRES SAW NO OTHER THING NOR WILL YOUR POSTERITY
7092-56730-0137 AND COME THE WORST THAT CAN COME THE DISTRIBUTION AND VARIETY OF ALL THE ACTS OF MY COMEDY ARE PERFORMED IN A YEAR IF YOU HAVE OBSERVED THE REVOLUTION OF MY FOUR SEASONS THEY COMPREHEND THE INFANCY THE YOUTH
7092-56730-0138 THE VIRILITY AND THE OLD AGE OF THE WORLD THE YEAR HAS PLAYED HIS PART AND KNOWS NO OTHER ART BUT TO BEGIN AGAIN IT WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME THING
7092-56730-0139 NOR FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO PLEASE YOU TIS THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
7092-56730-0140 GIVE PLACE TO OTHERS AS OTHERS HAVE GIVEN PLACE TO YOU EQUALITY IS THE SOUL OF EQUITY WHO CAN COMPLAIN OF BEING COMPREHENDED IN THE SAME DESTINY WHEREIN ALL ARE INVOLVED BESIDES LIVE AS LONG AS YOU CAN
7092-56730-0141 AND YET I WILL PLACE YOU IN SUCH A CONDITION AS YOU SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO BE DISPLEASED
7092-56730-0142 KNOW YOU NOT THAT WHEN DEAD THERE CAN BE NO OTHER LIVING SELF TO LAMENT YOU DEAD STANDING ON YOUR GRAVE
7092-56730-0143 NOR SHALL YOU SO MUCH AS WISH FOR THE LIFE YOU ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT
7092-56730-0144 DEATH IS LESS TO BE FEARED THAN NOTHING IF THERE COULD BE ANYTHING LESS THAN NOTHING MULTO
7092-56730-0145 NEITHER CAN IT ANY WAY CONCERN YOU WHETHER YOU ARE LIVING OR DEAD LIVING BY REASON THAT YOU ARE STILL IN BEING DEAD BECAUSE YOU ARE NO MORE MOREOVER NO ONE DIES BEFORE HIS HOUR
7092-56730-0146 THE TIME YOU LEAVE BEHIND WAS NO MORE YOURS THAN THAT WAS LAPSED AND GONE BEFORE YOU CAME INTO THE WORLD NOR DOES IT ANY MORE CONCERN YOU
7092-56730-0147 WHEREVER YOUR LIFE ENDS IT IS ALL THERE THE UTILITY OF LIVING CONSISTS NOT IN THE LENGTH OF DAYS BUT IN THE USE OF TIME A MAN MAY HAVE LIVED LONG AND YET LIVED BUT A LITTLE

7092-56730-0156 CHIRON REFUSED TO BE IMMORTAL WHEN HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH HE WAS TO ENJOY IT BY THE GOD OF TIME ITSELF AND ITS DURATION HIS FATHER SATURN
7092-56730-0157 DO BUT SERIOUSLY CONSIDER HOW MUCH MORE INSUPPORTABLE AND PAINFUL AN IMMORTAL LIFE WOULD BE TO MAN THAN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN HIM IF YOU HAD NOT DEATH YOU WOULD ETERNALLY CURSE ME FOR HAVING DEPRIVED YOU OF IT
7092-56730-0158 I HAVE MIXED A LITTLE BITTERNESS WITH IT
