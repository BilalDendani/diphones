8066-290901-0024 SHE FELT PERFECTLY FINE THEN I KNOW BUT SHE'S AN OLD CAT SHE NEVER STRAYS AWAY OF HER OWN ACCORD AND CERTAINLV NO ONE WOULD STEAL AN OLD BLIND CAT
8066-290901-0025 LATER ON DURING THE DAY A MAN CAME WALKING UP TO THEIR HOUSE HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS THE NEW NEIGHBOR WHO JUST MOVED ACROSS THE LITTLE CREEK HE MADE INQUIRIES AS TO WHERE HE COULD BUY FRESH VEGETABLES AND MILK
8066-290901-0026 AND JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE HE REMARKED I DID A STRANGE THING EARLY THIS MORNING THERE WAS AN OLD CAT CAME OVER TO MY PLACE ONE EAR WAS ALMOST GONE AND IT WAS BLIND I'M NOT MUCH OF A HAND TO MAKE WAY WITH THINGS
8066-290901-0027 BUT I FELT SO SORRY FOR THAT POOR OLD ANIMAL THAT I KILLED IT OH WITH A STRANGLED SOB JIMMY QUICKLY LEFT THE ROOM
8066-290901-0028 HE WAS VERY SORRY BUT OF COURSE THAT DID NOT BRING THE CAT BACK WHEN I SAW IT I JUST BANGED IT OVER THE HEAD WITH A STICK AND THEN BURIED IT YOU WILL NEVER KNOW HOW BADLY I FEEL ABOUT IT
8066-290901-0029 WHEN HE WAS GONE MOTHER WENT OUT TO FIND JIMMY AND COMFORT HIM HE WAS OUT IN THE ORCHARD ON HIS KNEES QUIETLY SHE WENT UP AND KNELT BESIDE HIM SLIPPING HER ARM ABOUT HIS SHOULDER HE TURNED TO HER AT ONCE MOTHER
8066-290901-0030 THERE'S SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT ANNETTE I'VE BEEN PRAYING AND I FEEL ALL HAPPY INSIDE IT'S JUST AS IF SHE WASN'T DEAD AT ALL
8066-290901-0031 SHE SAID HE DOES HELP US BEAR OUR BURDENS IN A WONDERFUL WAY I'LL SAY HE DOES THIS MORNING I FELT SO BAD I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THEN WHEN THAT MAN SAID HE HAD KILLED ANNETTE
8066-290901-0032 AND HERE I AM HAPPY AS ANYTHING AGAIN AND JUST BECAUSE I TOOK IT ALL TO JESUS I THINK ANNETTE IS ALL RIGHT NOW
8066-290901-0033 BUT JIMMY WAS RUNNING SWIFTLY ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARD AN OLD BLIND CAT THAT WAS STAGGERING IN HIS DIRECTION APPARENTLY THE NEW NEIGHBOR HAD ONLY STUNNED THE CAT AND SHE HAD DUG HER WAY OUT OF THE SHALLOW HOLE AND COME HOME AGAIN
8066-290901-0034 IT WAS YEARS BEFORE SHE REALLY DIED AND LONG BEFORE SHE PRESENTED JIMMY WITH A VERY TINY KITTEN WITH TWO WHOLE EARS AND TWO VERY BRIGHT EYES THIS STORY MAY SOUND STRANGE TO YOU
8066-290901-0035 THAT IT IS REALLY TRUE MARY M NAYLOR HOW GOD ANSWERED DONALD'S PRAYER
8066-290901-0036 GOD OFTEN USES CHILDREN TO WIN GROWN FOLKS FOR CHRIST LITTLE CHILDREN NOT ONLY HAVE A DEEP FAITH BUT A CHILDLIKE TRUST IN BELIEVING THAT GOD ANSWERS THEIR PRAYERS ALL THAT YE ASK IN MY NAME BELIEVING
8066-290901-0037 AS A YOUNG GIRL I WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL AND LEARNED ABOUT JESUS ALTHOUGH I KNEW ABOUT MY SAVIOR AND WHAT HE HAD DONE TO SAVE ME YET I NEVER ACCEPTED HIM AS MY OWN REDEEMER AND FRIEND AS YEARS WENT BY
8066-290901-0038 FOR TEN YEARS I NEVER ENTERED A CHURCH HOUSE EXCEPT TO ATTEND MY FATHER'S FUNERAL I SAW HIM GO INTO ETERNITY WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO POINT HIM TO THE LAMB OF GOD WHICH TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD DURING THESE YEARS I HAD MARRIED AND GOD HAD GIVEN US A DEAR LITTLE BOY
8066-290901-0039 DONALD BEGAN TO ATTEND SUNDAY SCHOOL EARLY IN YEARS OFTEN ON SUNDAY MORNINGS HE WOULD GET READY FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL AFTER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT WILD PARTIES WERE A PART OF THE UNGODLY LIFE WE LIVED IN OUR HOME
8066-290901-0040 I PROMISED HIM TO COME UP SOON BUT I CONTINUED ON FOR SOME HOURS WITH THE DRUNKEN CROWD WHEN I DID COME UP TO OUR APARTMENT I FOUND DONALD ON HIS KNEES BY HIS BED WITH HIS TESTAMENT AND AN OLD HYMN BOOK OF MY MOTHER IN LAW'S
8066-290901-0041 THE BOOKS WERE OPEN ON THE BED HE LOOKED UP THROUGH HIS TEARS AND SAID MOTHER I AM PRAYING FOR YOU I LOOKED AT THE TESTAMENT AND HYMNAL WHICH WERE WET WITH TEARS THAT HE HAD SHED FOR HIS UNGODLY MOTHER
8066-290901-0042 ON SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH FOLLOWING THIS EXPERIENCE I WENT TO A MISSION THAT NIGHT A GROUP OF CHRISTIANS UNITED IN ASKING GOD FOR MY SOUL WHEN THE SONG LORD I'M COMING HOME WAS SUNG AFTER THE SERVICE
8066-290901-0043 I MADE MY WAY TO THE ALTAR WHILE KNEELING THERE I FELT SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO MY SIDE IT WAS DONALD WHO WAS PRAYING FOR HIS MOTHER GOD HEARD MY PRAYER TO BE SAVED HE WAS MERCIFUL AND WASHED AWAY MY SINS
8066-290901-0044 PSALM FIFTY ONE HAS BECOME PRECIOUS TO ME GOD SAVED ME FOR SERVICE I MARVEL AT HIS GRACE AND MERCY TOWARD ME
8066-290901-0045 I AM THANKFUL ALSO FOR MY LITTLE BOY WHO NEVER CEASED TO PRAY FOR HIS MOTHER NOW MY LIFE IS IN GOD'S HANDS
8066-290901-0046 I AM ESPECIALLY BURDENED FOR OTHERS IN THE BONDAGE OF SIN AS I WAS
