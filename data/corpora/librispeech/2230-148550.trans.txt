2230-148550-0000 THE HOUSE TO BEGIN WITH WAS SMALL AND RATHER SHABBY THERE WAS NO GILDING NO LAVISH DIFFUSION OF LIGHT THE ROOM THEY SAT IN AFTER DINNER WITH ITS GREEN SHADED LAMPS MAKING FAINT POOLS OF BRIGHTNESS AND ITS ROWS OF BOOKS FROM FLOOR TO CEILING
2230-148550-0001 BEFORE THE NEW MARBLE BUILDING WAS PUT UP THEN INSTEAD OF A GAS LOG OR A POLISHED GRATE WITH ELECTRIC BULBS BEHIND RUBY GLASS THERE WAS AN OLD FASHIONED WOOD FIRE LIKE PICTURES OF BACK TO THE FARM FOR CHRISTMAS AND WHEN THE LOGS FELL FORWARD
2230-148550-0002 MISSUS PAIRFORD OR HER BROTHER HAD TO JUMP UP TO PUSH THEM IN PLACE AND THE ASHES SCATTERED OVER THE HEARTH UNTIDILY THE DINNER TOO WAS DISAPPOINTING UNDINE WAS TOO YOUNG TO TAKE NOTE OF CULINARY DETAILS
2230-148550-0003 BUT SHE HAD EXPECTED TO VIEW THE COMPANY THROUGH A BOWER OF ORCHIDS AND EAT PRETTY COLOURED ENTREES IN RUFFLED PAPERS INSTEAD THERE WAS ONLY A LOW CENTRE DISH OF FERNS AND PLAIN ROASTED AND BROILED MEAT THAT ONE COULD RECOGNIZE AS IF THEY'D BEEN DYSPEPTICS ON A DIET
2230-148550-0004 AND THE FOURTH A GIRL LIKE HERSELF WHO WAS INTRODUCED AS MISS HARRIET RAY SHE DISMISSED AT A GLANCE AS PLAIN AND WEARING A LAST YEAR'S MODEL THE MEN TOO WERE LESS STRIKING THAN SHE HAD HOPED
2230-148550-0005 SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED MUCH OF MISTER FAIRFORD SINCE MARRIED MEN WERE INTRINSICALLY UNINTERESTING AND HIS BALDNESS AND GREY MOUSTACHE SEEMED NATURALLY TO RELEGATE HIM TO THE BACKGROUND BUT SHE HAD LOOKED FOR SOME BRILLIANT YOUTHS OF HER OWN AGE IN HER INMOST HEART SHE HAD LOOKED FOR MISTER POPPLE
2230-148550-0006 UNDINE SAT BETWEEN MISTER BOWEN AND YOUNG MARVELL WHO STRUCK HER AS VERY SWEET IT WAS HER WORD FOR FRIENDLINESS BUT EVEN SHYER THAN AT THE HOTEL DANCE YET SHE WAS NOT SURE IF HE WERE SHY
2230-148550-0007 BUT HE LEFT IT TO HIS SISTER AND THE OTHERS TO DRAW HER OUT AND FIT HER INTO THE PATTERN MISSUS FAIRFORD TALKED SO WELL THAT THE GIRL WONDERED WHY MISSUS HEENY HAD FOUND HER LACKING IN CONVERSATION BUT THOUGH UNDINE THOUGHT SILENT PEOPLE AWKWARD SHE WAS NOT EASILY IMPRESSED BY
2230-148550-0008 BEATING TIME FOR THEM WITH HER SMILE AND SOMEHOW HARMONIZING AND LINKING TOGETHER WHAT THEY SAID SHE TOOK PARTICULAR PAINS TO GIVE UNDINE HER DUE PART IN THE PERFORMANCE BUT THE GIRL'S EXPANSIVE IMPULSES WERE ALWAYS BALANCED BY ODD REACTIONS OF MISTRUST
2230-148550-0009 WHEN HER HOST ASKED HER TO TRY SOME GRAPES AND I WOULDN'T WONDER WHEN SHE THOUGHT ANY ONE WAS TRYING TO ASTONISH HER
2230-148550-0010 TO WHICH MISSUS FAIRFORD SHRUGGED ASSENTINGLY THAT DELIGHTFUL POPPLE HE PAINTS SO EXACTLY AS HE TALKS THE WHITE HAIRED LADY TOOK IT UP ALL HIS PORTRAITS SEEM TO PROCLAIM WHAT A GENTLEMAN HE IS AND HOW HE FASCINATES WOMEN
2230-148550-0011 THEY'RE NOT PICTURES OF MISSUS OR MISS SO AND SO BUT SIMPLY OF THE IMPRESSION POPPLE THINKS HE'S MADE ON THEM MISSUS FAIRFORD SMILED I'VE SOMETIMES THOUGHT SHE MUSED THAT MISTER POPPLE MUST BE THE ONLY GENTLEMAN I KNOW
2230-148550-0012 AT LEAST HE'S THE ONLY MAN WHO HAS EVER TOLD ME HE WAS A GENTLEMAN AND MISTER POPPLE NEVER FAILS TO MENTION IT UNDINE'S EAR WAS TOO WELL ATTUNED TO THE NATIONAL NOTE OF IRONY FOR HER NOT TO PERCEIVE THAT HER COMPANIONS WERE MAKING SPORT OF THE PAINTER
2230-148550-0013 SHE WINCED AT THEIR BANTER AS IF IT HAD BEEN AT HER OWN EXPENSE YET IT GAVE HER A DIZZY SENSE OF BEING AT LAST IN THE VERY STRONGHOLD OF FASHION HER ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED BY HEARING MISSUS VAN DEGEN UNDER COVER OF THE GENERAL LAUGH SAY IN A LOW TONE TO YOUNG MARVELL
2230-148550-0014 SOMETHING IN HER TONE MADE ALL UNDINE'S PERCEPTIONS BRISTLE AND SHE STRAINED HER EARS FOR THE ANSWER I THINK HE'LL DO YOU CAPITALLY YOU MUST LET ME COME AND SEE SOME DAY SOON MARVELL'S TONE WAS ALWAYS SO LIGHT SO UNEMPHASIZED
2230-148550-0015 THAT SHE COULD NOT BE SURE OF ITS BEING AS INDIFFERENT AS IT SOUNDED SHE LOOKED DOWN AT THE FRUIT ON HER PLATE AND SHOT A SIDE GLANCE THROUGH HER LASHES AT MISSUS PETER VAN DEGEN MISSUS VAN DEGEN WAS NEITHER BEAUTIFUL NOR IMPOSING JUST A DARK GIRLISH LOOKING CREATURE WITH PLAINTIVE EYES
2230-148550-0016 AND A FIDGETY FREQUENT LAUGH BUT SHE WAS MORE ELABORATELY DRESSED AND JEWELLED THAN THE OTHER LADIES AND HER ELEGANCE AND HER RESTLESSNESS MADE HER SEEM LESS ALIEN TO UNDINE SHE HAD TURNED ON MARVELL A GAZE AT ONCE PLEADING AND POSSESSIVE
2230-148550-0017 BUT WHETHER BETOKENING MERELY AN INHERITED INTIMACY UNDINE HAD NOTICED THAT THEY WERE ALL MORE OR LESS COUSINS OR A MORE PERSONAL FEELING HER OBSERVER WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE JUST AS THE TONE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S REPLY MIGHT HAVE EXPRESSED THE OPEN AVOWAL OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
2230-148550-0018 OR THE DISGUISE OF A DIFFERENT SENTIMENT ALL WAS BLURRED AND PUZZLING TO THE GIRL IN THIS WORLD OF HALF LIGHTS HALF TONES ELIMINATIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS AND SHE FELT A VIOLENT LONGING TO BRUSH AWAY THE COBWEBS AND ASSERT HERSELF AS THE DOMINANT FIGURE OF THE SCENE
2230-148550-0019 YET IN THE DRAWING ROOM WITH THE LADIES WHERE MISSUS FAIRFORD CAME AND SAT BY HER THE SPIRIT OF CAUTION ONCE MORE PREVAILED SHE WANTED TO BE NOTICED BUT SHE DREADED TO BE PATRONIZED AND HERE AGAIN HER HOSTESS'S GRADATIONS OF TONE WERE CONFUSING
2230-148550-0020 MISSUS FAIRFORD MADE NO TACTLESS ALLUSIONS TO HER BEING A NEWCOMER IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NOTHING AS BITTER TO THE GIRL AS THAT BUT HER QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT PICTURES HAD INTERESTED UNDINE AT THE VARIOUS EXHIBITIONS OF THE MOMENT AND WHICH OF THE NEW BOOKS SHE HAD READ
2230-148550-0021 WERE ALMOST AS OPEN TO SUSPICION SINCE THEY HAD TO BE ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE UNDINE DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THERE WERE ANY PICTURES TO BE SEEN MUCH LESS THAT PEOPLE WENT TO SEE THEM AND SHE HAD READ NO NEW BOOK BUT WHEN THE KISSING HAD TO STOP
2230-148550-0022 OF WHICH MISSUS FAIRFORD SEEMED NOT TO HAVE HEARD ON THE THEATRE THEY WERE EQUALLY AT ODDS FOR WHILE UNDINE HAD SEEN OOLALOO FOURTEEN TIMES AND WAS WILD ABOUT NED NORRIS IN THE SODA WATER FOUNTAIN
2230-148550-0023 AND KNEW ONLY BY NAME THE CLEVER AMERICAN ACTRESS WHO WAS TRYING TO GIVE REPERTORY PLAYS WITH A GOOD STOCK COMPANY THE CONVERSATION WAS REVIVED FOR A MOMENT BY HER RECALLING THAT SHE HAD SEEN SARAH BERNHARD IN A PLAY SHE CALLED LEG LONG
2230-148550-0024 SHE INFERRED THAT THE OTHERS DIDN'T CARE TO TALK TO HER AND THAT HER HOST AND HOSTESS WERE IN LEAGUE TO TAKE HER OFF THEIR HANDS THIS DISCOVERY RESULTED IN HER HOLDING HER VIVID HEAD VERY HIGH AND ANSWERING I COULDN'T REALLY SAY OR IS THAT SO
2230-148550-0025 TO ALL MISTER FAIRFORD'S VENTURES AND AS THESE WERE NEITHER NUMEROUS NOR STRIKING IT WAS A RELIEF TO BOTH WHEN THE RISING OF THE ELDERLY LADY GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR DEPARTURE IN THE HALL WHERE YOUNG MARVELL HAD MANAGED TO PRECEDE HER
2230-148550-0026 AS SHE GATHERED IT ABOUT HER SHE LAID HER HAND ON MARVELL'S ARM RALPHIE DEAR YOU'LL COME TO THE OPERA WITH ME ON FRIDAY WE'LL DINE TOGETHER FIRST PETER'S GOT A CLUB DINNER THEY EXCHANGED WHAT SEEMED A SMILE OF INTELLIGENCE AND UNDINE HEARD THE YOUNG MAN ACCEPT
2230-148550-0027 WHEN SHE HAD DRAWN IT ON WITH HAUGHTY DELIBERATION SHE FOUND MARVELL AT HER SIDE IN HAT AND OVERCOAT AND HER HEART GAVE A HIGHER BOUND HE WAS GOING TO ESCORT HER HOME OF COURSE THIS BRILLIANT YOUTH SHE FELT NOW THAT HE WAS BRILLIANT WHO DINED ALONE WITH MARRIED WOMEN
2230-148550-0028 WHOM THE VAN DEGEN SET CALLED RALPHIE DEAR HAD REALLY NO EYES FOR ANY ONE BUT HERSELF AND AT THE THOUGHT HER LOST SELF COMPLACENCY FLOWED BACK WARM THROUGH HER VEINS THE STREET WAS COATED WITH ICE
2230-148550-0029 AND HOLDING IT FAST WHILE THEY WAITED FOR HER CAB TO COME UP BUT WHEN HE HAD HELPED HER IN HE CLOSED THE DOOR AND HELD HIS HAND OUT OVER THE LOWERED WINDOW GOOD BYE HE SAID SMILING AND SHE COULD NOT HELP THE BREAK OF PRIDE IN HER VOICE AS SHE FALTERED OUT STUPIDLY FROM THE DEPTHS OF HER DISILLUSIONMENT OH
