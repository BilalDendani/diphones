2946-163375-0000 I COULD SEE THE SUN OUT AT ONE OR TWO HOLES BUT MOSTLY IT WAS BIG TREES ALL ABOUT AND GLOOMY IN THERE AMONGST THEM THERE WAS FRECKLED PLACES ON THE GROUND WHERE THE LIGHT SIFTED DOWN THROUGH THE LEAVES
2946-163375-0001 AND THE FRECKLED PLACES SWAPPED ABOUT A LITTLE SHOWING THERE WAS A LITTLE BREEZE UP THERE A COUPLE OF SQUIRRELS SET ON A LIMB AND JABBERED AT ME VERY FRIENDLY
2946-163375-0002 WELL I WAS DOZING OFF AGAIN WHEN I THINKS I HEARS A DEEP SOUND OF BOOM AWAY UP THE RIVER I ROUSES UP AND RESTS ON MY ELBOW AND LISTENS PRETTY SOON I HEARS IT AGAIN
2946-163375-0003 I HOPPED UP AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT AT A HOLE IN THE LEAVES AND I SEE A BUNCH OF SMOKE LAYING ON THE WATER
2946-163375-0004 AND THERE WAS THE FERRYBOAT FULL OF PEOPLE FLOATING ALONG DOWN I KNOWED WHAT WAS THE MATTER NOW BOOM I SEE THE WHITE SMOKE SQUIRT OUT OF THE FERRYBOAT'S SIDE YOU SEE THEY WAS FIRING CANNON OVER THE WATER
2946-163375-0005 TRYING TO MAKE MY CARCASS COME TO THE TOP I WAS PRETTY HUNGRY
2946-163375-0006 SO I SET THERE AND WATCHED THE CANNON SMOKE AND LISTENED TO THE BOOM THE RIVER WAS A MILE WIDE THERE AND IT
2946-163375-0007 IF I ONLY HAD A BITE TO EAT WELL THEN I HAPPENED TO THINK HOW THEY ALWAYS PUT QUICKSILVER IN LOAVES OF BREAD AND FLOAT THEM OFF BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS GO RIGHT TO THE DROWNDED CARCASS AND STOP THERE SO SAYS I
2946-163375-0008 I'LL KEEP A LOOKOUT AND IF ANY OF THEM'S FLOATING AROUND AFTER ME I'LL GIVE THEM A SHOW I CHANGED TO THE ILLINOIS EDGE OF THE ISLAND TO SEE WHAT LUCK I COULD HAVE AND I WARN'T DISAPPOINTED
2946-163375-0009 A BIG DOUBLE LOAF COME ALONG AND I MOST GOT IT WITH A LONG STICK BUT MY FOOT SLIPPED AND SHE FLOATED OUT FURTHER OF COURSE I WAS WHERE THE CURRENT SET IN THE CLOSEST TO THE SHORE I KNOWED ENOUGH FOR THAT
2946-163375-0010 BUT BY AND BY ALONG COMES ANOTHER ONE AND THIS TIME I WON I TOOK OUT THE PLUG AND SHOOK OUT THE LITTLE DAB OF QUICKSILVER AND SET MY TEETH IN IT WAS BAKER'S BREAD
2946-163375-0011 I GOT A GOOD PLACE AMONGST THE LEAVES AND SET THERE ON A LOG MUNCHING THE BREAD AND WATCHING THE FERRY BOAT AND VERY WELL SATISFIED AND THEN SOMETHING STRUCK ME I SAYS
2946-163375-0012 NOW I RECKON THE WIDOW OR THE PARSON OR SOMEBODY PRAYED THAT THIS BREAD WOULD FIND ME AND HERE IT HAS GONE AND DONE IT SO THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT BUT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT THINGTHAT
2946-163375-0013 THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT WHEN A BODY LIKE THE WIDOW OR THE PARSON PRAYS BUT IT DON'T WORK FOR ME AND I RECKON IT DON'T WORK FOR ONLY JUST THE RIGHT KIND I LIT A PIPE AND HAD A GOOD LONG SMOKE AND WENT ON WATCHING
2946-163375-0014 THE FERRYBOAT WAS FLOATING WITH THE CURRENT AND I ALLOWED I'D HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE WHO WAS ABOARD WHEN SHE COME ALONG BECAUSE SHE WOULD COME IN CLOSE WHERE THE BREAD DID WHEN SHE'D GOT PRETTY WELL ALONG DOWN TOWARDS ME
2946-163375-0015 I PUT OUT MY PIPE AND WENT TO WHERE I FISHED OUT THE BREAD AND LAID DOWN BEHIND A LOG ON THE BANK IN A LITTLE OPEN PLACE WHERE THE LOG FORKED I COULD PEEP THROUGH
2946-163375-0016 BY AND BY SHE COME ALONG AND SHE DRIFTED IN SO CLOSE THAT THEY COULD A RUN OUT A PLANK AND WALKED ASHORE MOST EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BOAT
2946-163375-0017 PAP AND JUDGE THATCHER AND BESSIE THATCHER AND JO HARPER AND TOM SAWYER AND HIS OLD AUNT POLLY AND SID AND MARY AND PLENTY MORE EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MURDER BUT THE CAPTAIN BROKE IN AND SAYS
2946-163375-0018 LOOK SHARP NOW THE CURRENT SETS IN THE CLOSEST HERE AND MAYBE HE'S WASHED ASHORE AND GOT TANGLED AMONGST THE BRUSH AT THE WATER'S EDGE I HOPE SO ANYWAY I DIDN'T HOPE SO
2946-163375-0019 THEY ALL CROWDED UP AND LEANED OVER THE RAILS NEARLY IN MY FACE AND KEPT STILL WATCHING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT I COULD SEE THEM FIRST RATE BUT THEY COULDN'T SEE ME THEN THE CAPTAIN SUNG OUT STAND AWAY
2946-163375-0020 AND THE CANNON LET OFF SUCH A BLAST RIGHT BEFORE ME
2946-163375-0021 AND PRETTY NEAR BLIND WITH THE SMOKE AND I JUDGED I WAS GONE
2946-163375-0022 I RECKON THEY'D A GOT THE CORPSE THEY WAS AFTER WELL I SEE I WARN'T HURT THANKS TO GOODNESS THE BOAT FLOATED ON AND WENT OUT OF SIGHT AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE ISLAND I COULD HEAR THE BOOMING NOW AND THEN
2946-163375-0023 FURTHER AND FURTHER OFF AND BY AND BY AFTER AN HOUR I DIDN'T HEAR IT NO MORE THE ISLAND WAS THREE MILE LONG I JUDGED THEY HAD GOT TO THE FOOT AND WAS GIVING IT UP BUT THEY DIDN'T YET A WHILE
2946-163375-0024 THEY TURNED AROUND THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND AND STARTED UP THE CHANNEL ON THE MISSOURI SIDE UNDER STEAM AND BOOMING ONCE IN A WHILE AS THEY WENT I CROSSED OVER TO THAT SIDE AND WATCHED THEM
2946-163375-0025 WHEN THEY GOT ABREAST THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND THEY QUIT SHOOTING AND DROPPED OVER TO THE MISSOURI SHORE AND WENT HOME TO THE TOWN I KNOWED I WAS ALL RIGHT NOW NOBODY ELSE WOULD COME A HUNTING AFTER ME
2946-163375-0026 I GOT MY TRAPS OUT OF THE CANOE AND MADE ME A NICE CAMP IN THE THICK WOODS I MADE A KIND OF A TENT OUT OF MY BLANKETS TO PUT MY THINGS UNDER SO THE RAIN COULDN'T GET AT THEM I CATCHED A CATFISH AND HAGGLED HIM OPEN WITH MY SAW
2946-163375-0027 AND TOWARDS SUNDOWN I STARTED MY CAMP FIRE AND HAD SUPPER THEN I SET OUT A LINE TO CATCH SOME FISH FOR BREAKFAST WHEN IT WAS DARK I SET BY MY CAMP FIRE SMOKING AND FEELING PRETTY WELL SATISFIED
2946-163375-0028 BUT BY AND BY IT GOT SORT OF LONESOME AND SO I WENT AND SET ON THE BANK AND LISTENED TO THE CURRENT SWASHING ALONG AND COUNTED THE STARS AND DRIFT LOGS AND RAFTS THAT COME DOWN AND THEN WENT TO BED
2946-163375-0029 YOU CAN'T STAY SO YOU SOON GET OVER IT AND SO FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS NO DIFFERENCEJUST THE SAME THING BUT THE NEXT DAY I WENT EXPLORING AROUND DOWN THROUGH THE ISLAND I WAS BOSS OF IT
2946-163375-0030 IT ALL BELONGED TO ME SO TO SAY AND I WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT BUT MAINLY I WANTED TO PUT IN THE TIME I FOUND PLENTY STRAWBERRIES RIPE AND PRIME AND GREEN SUMMER GRAPES AND GREEN RAZBERRIES AND THE GREEN BLACKBERRIES WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW
2946-163375-0031 THEY WOULD ALL COME HANDY BY AND BY I JUDGED WELL I WENT FOOLING ALONG IN THE DEEP WOODS TILL I JUDGED I WARN'T FAR FROM THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND I HAD MY GUN ALONG BUT I HADN'T SHOT NOTHING
2946-163375-0032 IT WAS FOR PROTECTION THOUGHT I WOULD KILL SOME GAME NIGH HOME ABOUT THIS TIME I MIGHTY NEAR STEPPED ON A GOOD SIZED SNAKE AND IT WENT SLIDING OFF THROUGH THE GRASS AND FLOWERS AND I AFTER IT TRYING TO GET A SHOT AT IT
2946-163375-0033 I CLIPPED ALONG AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I BOUNDED RIGHT ON TO THE ASHES OF A CAMP FIRE THAT WAS STILL SMOKING MY HEART JUMPED UP AMONGST MY LUNGS
2946-163375-0034 BUT UNCOCKED MY GUN AND WENT SNEAKING BACK ON MY TIPTOES
2946-163375-0035 EVERY NOW AND THEN I STOPPED A SECOND AMONGST THE THICK LEAVES AND LISTENED BUT MY BREATH COME SO HARD I COULDN'T HEAR NOTHING ELSE I SLUNK ALONG ANOTHER PIECE FURTHER THEN LISTENED AGAIN AND SO ON AND SO ON
2946-163375-0036 IF I SEE A STUMP I TOOK IT FOR A MAN IF I TROD ON A STICK AND BROKE IT IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE A PERSON HAD CUT ONE OF MY BREATHS IN TWO AND I ONLY GOT HALF AND THE SHORT HALF TOO WHEN I GOT TO CAMP I WARN'T FEELING VERY BRASH
2946-163375-0037 THERE WARN'T MUCH SAND IN MY CRAW BUT I SAYS THIS AIN'T NO TIME TO BE FOOLING AROUND
2946-163375-0038 SO AS TO HAVE THEM OUT OF SIGHT AND I PUT OUT THE FIRE AND SCATTERED THE ASHES AROUND TO LOOK LIKE AN OLD LAST YEAR'S CAMP AND THEN CLUMB A TREE I RECKON I WAS UP IN THE TREE TWO HOURS BUT I DIDN'T SEE NOTHING
2946-163375-0039 I DIDN'T HEAR NOTHING I ONLY THOUGHT I HEARD AND SEEN AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND THINGS WELL I COULDN'T STAY UP THERE FOREVER SO AT LAST I GOT DOWN BUT I KEPT IN THE THICK WOODS AND ON THE LOOKOUT ALL THE TIME
2946-163375-0040 ALL I COULD GET TO EAT WAS BERRIES AND WHAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM BREAKFAST BY THE TIME IT WAS NIGHT I WAS PRETTY HUNGRY SO WHEN IT WAS GOOD AND DARK I SLID OUT FROM SHORE BEFORE MOONRISE AND PADDLED OVER TO THE ILLINOIS BANKABOUT
2946-163375-0041 I WENT OUT IN THE WOODS AND COOKED A SUPPER AND I HAD ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND I WOULD STAY THERE ALL NIGHT WHEN I HEAR A PLUNKETY PLUNK PLUNKETY PLUNK AND SAYS TO MYSELF
2946-163375-0042 AND NEXT I HEAR PEOPLE'S VOICES
2946-163375-0043 CREEPING THROUGH THE WOODS TO SEE WHAT I COULD FIND OUT I HADN'T GOT FAR WHEN I HEAR A MAN SAY WE BETTER CAMP HERE IF WE CAN FIND A GOOD PLACE
2946-163375-0044 LET'S LOOK AROUND I DIDN'T WAIT BUT SHOVED OUT AND PADDLED AWAY EASY I TIED UP IN THE OLD PLACE AND RECKONED I WOULD SLEEP IN THE CANOE I DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH I COULDN'T SOMEHOW FOR THINKING AND EVERY TIME I WAKED UP
2946-163375-0045 I THOUGHT SOMEBODY HAD ME BY THE NECK SO THE SLEEP DIDN'T DO ME NO GOOD BY AND BY I SAYS TO MYSELF I CAN'T LIVE THIS WAY I'M A GOING TO FIND OUT WHO IT IS THAT'S HERE ON THE ISLAND WITH ME
2946-163375-0046 I'LL FIND IT OUT OR BUST WELL I FELT BETTER RIGHT OFF SO I TOOK MY PADDLE AND SLID OUT FROM SHORE JUST A STEP OR TWO AND THEN LET THE CANOE DROP ALONG DOWN AMONGST THE SHADOWS
