7051-259009-0000 THE MEANING AND SCOPE OF ECONOMICS CAN BE BETTER SEEN AT THE END THAN AT THE BEGINNING OF ITS STUDY THE PROPOSITION WITH WHICH THIS INQUIRY OPENED MAY WELL BE RECALLED IN THE CLOSING CHAPTER
7051-259009-0001 THE WORDS OF THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF ECONOMICS SHOULD AT THIS POINT CONVEY A FULLER MEANING IN THE WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS PASSED IN REVIEW
7051-259009-0002 ECONOMIC STUDENTS HAVE GAINED THE EAR OF STATESMEN AND RULERS AND HAVE EXERCISED MUCH INFLUENCE UPON PRACTICAL POLITICS IT IS SOMETIMES BEMOANED THAT ECONOMISTS HAVE TO DAY SO SMALL A DIRECT PART
7051-259009-0003 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF OUR REPUBLIC THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A GREATER PART TO DAY THAN THEY HAD TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT IF THEY HAD NOT THERE WOULD BE SMALL OCCASION FOR REGRET THE IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE OF THE SPECIALIST ON THOSE IN AUTHORITY
7051-259009-0004 IS AT MOST TIMES LESS IN A REPUBLIC THAN IT IS IN A MONARCHY AT THOSE RARE TIMES
7051-259009-0005 THIS TEST HOWEVER IS ONE THAT ONLY ASTRONOMY CAN MEET IN ANY REMARKABLE DEGREE CHEMISTRY CAN TELL MUCH OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE LABORATORY BUT NOTHING OF THE DATE OF FUTURE POWDER MILL EXPLOSIONS
7051-259009-0006 GEOLOGY ANSWERS THE QUESTION WHAT WITH SURMISES AND WHEN WITH AN ESTIMATE OF A FEW MILLION YEARS MORE OR LESS IS IT SURPRISING THAT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS STILL LESS PREDICTION IS POSSIBLE THERE ARE COUNTLESS UNMEASURED FACTORS IN HUMAN ACTION
7051-259009-0007 SUCH GENERALIZATIONS AS ARE POSSIBLE MUST BE BASED ON ACTIONS THAT APPEAR AND REAPPEAR WITH PRACTICAL CONSTANCY THOUGH A NUMBER OF FACTS UNITE TO SUGGEST SOME CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
7051-259009-0008 THE CLOSE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION WAS A PERIOD MARKED BY MUCH SPECULATION REGARDING THE FUTURE OF SOCIETY THE OPTIMISTS WITH FAITH IN THE PERFECTABILITY OF HUMAN NATURE AND OF SOCIETY
7051-259009-0009 BELIEVED THAT ALL SOCIAL ILLS WERE DUE TO BAD GOVERNMENT IF DESPOTISM WERE BUT OVERTHROWN MAN'S NATURE WOULD DEVELOP UNTRAMMELED TO PERFECTION THE ECONOMISTS OF THAT DAY WERE SCEPTICAL
7051-259009-0010 BECAUSE LOOKING DEEPER THEY SAW SOURCES OF MISERY IN THE SCANTINESS OF MAN'S ENVIRONMENT AND IN THE SLOTH IGNORANCE AND INCAPACITY OF HUMAN NATURE THE PESSIMISTS THE COMMUNISTS AND SOCIALISTS OF THAT DAY
7051-259009-0011 SEEING THE SAME EVILS HAD OTHER EXPLANATIONS TO OFFER WHILE THE ECONOMISTS OF THAT DAY BELIEVED THE CONDITIONS OF POVERTY AND MISERY TO BE INEVITABLE THE PESSIMISTS PRONOUNCED THEM UNENDURABLE
7051-259009-0012 AND ADVOCATED A RADICAL SOCIAL CHANGE AS THE ONLY HOPE OF SAVING THE MASSES FROM STARVATION IN SUCH A VARIETY OF MUTUALLY CONTRADICTORY VIEWS
7051-259009-0013 APPEARS ABSURD IN THE LIGHT OF HISTORY THE INVENTIONS OF THE PERIOD FROM ADAM SMITH'S WRITINGS TO RICARDO'S SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX TO EIGHTEEN TWENTY WERE MOSTLY FOR USE IN MANUFACTURING
7051-259009-0014 THIS SUGGESTED TO THE MINDS OF THAT TIME THE PROGRESSIVE CHEAPENING OF CLOTH IRON POTTERY AND OF ALL OTHER PRODUCTS OF MACHINERY BUT NOT THE CHEAPENING OF FOOD INDEED THE SITUATION IN WESTERN EUROPE
7051-259009-0015 THEN SUGGESTED STRONGLY THE OPINION THAT THE PRODUCTS OF THE SOIL WOULD STEADILY BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO GET THE RAILROAD WAS NOT OF PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE UNTIL AFTER EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE STEAMBOAT
7051-259009-0016 WAS NOT APPLIED TO OCEAN TRAVEL UNTIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE OPENING OF A RICH CONTINENT AND ITS ANNEXATION BY THESE NEW AGENCIES TO THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES OF THE OLDER COUNTRIES WERE NOT DREAMED OF
7051-259009-0017 IT WAS NOT FULLY APPRECIATED THAT A GREAT CHANGE IN SOCIAL STANDARDS CONTROLLING THE GROWTH OF POPULATION WAS IN PROGRESS THIS WAS THE PANORAMA OF THE PROGRESS OF SOCIETY AS SEEN BY BOTH THE CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS
7051-259009-0018 AND THE SOCIALISTS OF LESS THAN A CENTURY AGO CONTINUED INVENTION AN INCREASING POPULATION
7051-259009-0019 THE MEN OF THAT DAY NATURALLY THOUGHT OF THE SUPPLY OF LAND AS LIMITED AND FIXED SUPPLY IN THE ECONOMIC SENSE MEANS THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE AT THE GIVEN TIME IN THE MARKET BUT DESPITE THE GREAT AREAS SINCE BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD MARKETS
7051-259009-0020 THE FALSE IDEA OF A CENTURY AGO STILL PERSISTS IN THE TEXT BOOKS
7051-259009-0021 IT IS VAIN TO SAY THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BEEN UNIQUE AND THAT THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE IS STILL VALID MUCH OF THE SO CALLED ORTHODOX ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WAS ESSENTIALLY ERRONEOUS AS APPLIED TO THE CONDITIONS OF THE PAST CENTURY
7051-259009-0022 IT IS ERRONEOUS TO DAY AND WILL BE SO FOR YEARS TO COME IF IT EVER FITS THE FACTS NEW CONTINENTS ARE ABOUT TO BE OPENED THE BUILDING OF RAILROADS THE LENGTH OF SOUTH AMERICA
7051-259009-0023 AND TO THE CENTER OF AFRICA WILL MAKE AVAILABLE NEW MINERAL WEALTH RARE WOODS ENORMOUS FORESTS AND SOME OF THE GREATEST FOOD PRODUCING AREAS ON THE GLOBE POPULATION IN CHRISTENDOM HAS INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
7051-259009-0024 BUT IT HAS NOT OVERTAKEN THE PROGRESS IN RESOURCES THE RATE OF INCREASE OF POPULATION IS SLACKENING THE RESULT OF THIS COMBINATION OF EVENTS HAS BEEN A GENERAL RISE OF THE CONDITIONS MAKING FOR POPULAR WELFARE
7051-259009-0025 DESPITE THE PROBLEMS AND THE ABUSES THAT EVERY NEW CHANGE BRINGS THE CIVILIZED WORLD UNDOUBTEDLY IS MORE PROSPEROUS TO DAY THAN EVER BEFORE THE GREATEST MISERY AND DISCONTENT IS IN THE MORE BACKWARD COMMUNITIES
7051-259009-0026 THIS IS PAST AND PRESENT WHAT OF THE ECONOMIC FUTURE IS THE PRESENT CONDITION A NORMAL ONE IS THIS PROSPERITY LIKELY TO GROW OR TO DECLINE THUS FAR SURELY THE ECONOMIC STUDENT MAY QUESTION THE ORACLES
7051-259009-0027 HAVE BEEN SLOWLY STORED UP THROUGH THE AGES
7051-259009-0028 MAN KNEW LITTLE OF THE WORLD BENEATH ITS CRUST LIVING HE SCRATCHED THE EARTH'S SURFACE AND DYING LEFT HIS BONES TO FERTILIZE THE SOIL BUT TO DAY MAN EXHAUSTS THE STORES IN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH
7051-259009-0029 BURNS THE TREASURES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS AGE CASTS THE FERTILIZING ELEMENTS INTO THE OCEAN AND LEAVES THE WORLD AN EMPTY SHELL FORESTS ARE BEING SO RAPIDLY CUT OFF
7051-259009-0030 THAT THE PRICE OF FUEL WOOD AND LUMBER IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES HAS WITHIN TWENTY YEARS BEEN MULTIPLIED BY THREE THE WORLD'S STORE OF IRON ORE IS NOT YET FULLY KNOWN BUT MUCH OF IT HAS BEEN MEASURED
7051-259009-0031 AND OF THE DEPOSITS KNOWN TO BE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OVER ONE HALF ARE SAID TO BE OWNED BY ONE CORPORATION AND THEY ARE ENOUGH TO CONTINUE ITS PRESENT OUTPUT NO MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS MANY OTHER NATURAL PRODUCTS
7051-259009-0032 ARE IN LIKE MANNER GATHERED BY CIVILIZED MAN
7051-259009-0033 BUT SO LONG AS THE SUN SHINES AND THE RAINS FALL NIAGARA WILL REMAIN AS A SOURCE OF LIGHT HEAT AND POWER THE TIDES FLOW ON FOREVER IN EVERY THUNDER STORM
7051-259009-0034 ENOUGH FORCE IS DISSIPATED TO RUN THOUSANDS OF FACTORIES THE HEAT IN THE CENTER OF THE GLOBE THOUGH NOT INEXHAUSTIBLE WOULD SUFFICE FOR MAN'S NEEDS FOR MANY CENTURIES
7051-259009-0035 IF CHAINED AND UTILIZED WOULD RUN A MILLION FACTORIES A MILLION YEARS IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO HOPE THAT ENGINEERING SKILL WILL SOME DAY REACH AND UTILIZE THESE SOURCES SUCH A CHEAPENING AND DIFFUSION OF POWER
7051-259009-0036 WOULD PUT A NEW FACE ON MANY OF THE PROBLEMS OF INDUSTRY NEW SOURCES OF MATERIALS UNDOUBTEDLY WILL BE DEVELOPED IT IS REASONABLE TO HOPE THAT BEFORE IRON ORE HAS BECOME EXTREMELY SCARCE A CHEAP
7051-259009-0037 AND PRACTICABLE METHOD OF EXTRACTING ALUMINIUM FROM CLAY
7051-259009-0038 NEW ENGLAND EVEN NOW FINDS HERSELF HARD PUSHED IN HER RIVALRY WITH THE SOUTHERN STATES IN THE MANUFACTURE OF TEXTILES THE INDUSTRIAL MAP OF OUR COUNTRY
7051-259009-0039 MUST BE THE PUTTING OF ENERGIES AND RESOURCES INTO MORE ABIDING FORMS IN ORDER THAT A MOTIVE FOR SAVING MAY BE PRESENT THERE MUST BE STABLE CONDITIONS INCREASING SUBORDINATION OF PRESENT TO FUTURE
7051-259009-0040 WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A FALL IN THE RATE OF INTEREST THE GROWTH OF WEALTH MEANS A HIGHER QUALITY OF ALL ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTIVE AGENTS A LARGER PART OF THE ENERGIES OF MEN WILL THEN BE DIRECTED MERELY TO SUPERVISING THE DEVELOPED MACHINERY
7051-259009-0041 MAN WILL LIVE IN A BETTER ENVIRONMENT IN A BETTER AND RICHER WORLD WAGES MUST RISE AS THE QUALITY OF TOOLS AND MACHINERY IMPROVES POPULATION MOST PROBABLY WILL NOT INCREASE PROPORTIONATELY
7051-259009-0042 AND THE RELATION OF THE LABOR SUPPLY TO THE RESOURCES WITH WHICH IT WORKS
7051-259009-0043 THE STEADY BIOLOGICAL BETTERMENT OF THE NATIVE ABILITY OF MEN THE EDUCATION OF THE AVERAGE MEMBER OF SOCIETY
7051-259009-0044 IN SO FAR AS IT BUILDS UP A BETTER ENVIRONMENT INTO WHICH OTHER CHILDREN WILL BE BORN BUT THE BETTERMENT IS NOT DUE TO THE INHERITANCE BY THE CHILD OF THE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL OF THE PARENT
7051-259009-0045 IF THIS QUESTION IS OPEN TO DISPUTE AMONG BIOLOGISTS IT IS ONLY AS REGARDS A MINUTE INCREMENT OF IMPROVEMENT PRACTICALLY SELECTION IS THE ONLY MEANS OF IMPROVING THE INNATE CAPACITY OF ANY SPECIES
7051-259009-0046 IN ANY LARGE MEASURE MANY FORCES WERE AT WORK IN THE PAST TO LIFT MAN ABOVE THE BRUTE AND ESPECIALLY TO INCREASE THE AVERAGE BRAIN POWER OF THE HUMAN RACE THE WEAK THE IGNORANT THE INCAPABLE IN PRIMITIVE SOCIETIES
7051-259009-0047 ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE LAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY THE SUCCESSFUL ELEMENTS OF SOCIETY ARE BECOMING LESS FERTILE LARGE FAMILIES WERE THE RULE AMONG THE CAPABLE PIONEERS OF AMERICA NOW THEY ARE RARE
7051-259009-0048 EXCEPT IN THE LOWER INDUSTRIAL RANKS DEMOCRACY AND OPPORTUNITY ARE FAVORING THIS PROCESS OF INCREASING THE MEDIOCRE AND REDUCING THE EXCELLENT STRAINS OF STOCK CASTE AND STATUS KEPT SUCCESSFUL GENERATIONS OF CAPABLE MEN
7051-259009-0049 IN HUMBLE SOCIAL RANKS FROM WHICH ONLY BY CHANCE SOME REMARKABLE INDIVIDUAL COULD RISE IN A DEMOCRACY THOSE OF MARKED ABILITY CAN MORE EASILY MOVE INTO THE BETTER PAID CALLINGS AND PROFESSIONS
7051-259009-0050 THIS INDIVIDUAL GOOD FORTUNE HOWEVER REDUCES THE PROBABILITY OF OFFSPRING IN THE HIGHER SOCIAL RANKS ARE MORE BACHELORS AND OLD MAIDS THAN IN THE LOWER RANKS AND FEWER CHILDREN ARE BORN TO EACH MARRIAGE
7051-259009-0051 THE PRESIDENT OF OUR OLDEST UNIVERSITY HAS SHOWN THAT ONE FOURTH OF THE GRADUATES OF THE LAST GENERATION HAVE REMAINED SINGLE AND THAT THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN OF THE MARRIED GRADUATE IS TWO THAT GROUP OF MEN THEREFORE
7051-259009-0052 HAS LEFT ONLY THREE FOURTHS ENOUGH DESCENDANTS TO MAINTAIN ITS NUMBERS AND AS THE POPULATION HAS DOUBLED WITHIN THE SAME GENERATION THAT CLASS REPRESENTS ONLY THREE EIGHTHS AS LARGE A PROPORTION
7051-259009-0053 IF SOCIETY WERE COMPOSED IN EQUAL PARTS OF TWO DISTINCT STRAINS OF STOCK NOT INTERMARRYING IF THE TOTAL POPULATION KEPT INTACT FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER SAY EACH PERIOD OF THIRTY YEARS
7051-259009-0054 BUT THE SUPERIOR STRAIN CONTRIBUTED ONLY THREE FOURTHS OF ITS OWN NUMBER AT THE END OF FIVE GENERATIONS IT WOULD HAVE SUNK FROM ONE HALF TO A LITTLE MORE THAN ONE EIGHTH OF THE POPULATION A PERIOD BRIEF IN THE LIFE OF NATIONS
7051-259009-0055 WOULD SERVE TO LEAVE IT AN ALMOST NEGLIGIBLE FACTOR IN SOCIAL LIFE THERE CAN HARDLY BE A DOUBT THAT AT PRESENT OUR SOCIETY IS ON THE AVERAGE INCREASING FAR MORE FROM THE LESS PROVIDENT LESS ENTERPRISING
7051-259009-0056 THERE MUST BE LEFT A WIDE FIELD FOR THE AMBITIONS AND FOR THE COMPETITION OF INDIVIDUALS THE RESULTS OF ANY GIVEN ABILITY ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE ENERGY WITH WHICH IT IS USED THE SOCIAL MACHINERY FINDS ITS MOTIVE FORCE IN THE NATURE OF MEN
7051-259009-0057 IN TAKING ECONOMIC WANTS AS THE STARTING POINT OF OUR STUDY IT WAS NOT IMPLIED THAT MEN WERE ENTIRELY SELFISH SYMPATHY WIDENS ECONOMIC WANTS INCLUDE FAMILY FRIENDS AND IN A GROWING MEASURE HUMANITY
7051-259009-0058 THE HAPPINESS OF A TRULY SOCIALIZED MAN CONSISTS IN PART IN THE HAPPINESS OF HIS FELLOWS AS SOCIAL SYMPATHY BROADENS THE SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES A STRONGER ECONOMIC FORCE
7051-259009-0059 MEN CHANGE BUT NOT RAPIDLY AND NOT ALWAYS FOR THE BETTER IT IS UNSAFE TO OVERESTIMATE THE GENEROSITY OF MEN INDIVIDUAL WANTS AND INTERESTS MUST SO FAR AS CAN NOW BE SEEN
7051-259009-0060 BY SOCIAL CONVENTION COME TO BE REGARDED AS DEGRADING TAKES MUCH ABILITY OUT OF BUSINESS THE FREEDOM OF AMERICA TO SO GREAT A DEGREE FROM THIS DISDAIN OF HONEST LABOR
7051-259009-0061 HAS BEEN A LARGE FACTOR IN HER PROGRESS BUT IT IS ENDANGERED WHEN MEN BECOME TIMIDLY CONSERVATIVE OF SOCIAL POSITION PROGRESS IS THREATENED SECONDLY BY DEMOCRACY WITH ITS TENDENCY TO CARRY THE NOTION
7051-259009-0062 OF LITERAL EQUALITY OVER INTO INDUSTRY WHEN DEMOCRACY BECOMES ENVIOUS IT DENIES TO EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY AN EXCEPTIONAL REWARD THE LINE OF GROWTH MUST BE THE RESULTANT
7051-259009-0063 OF THE POSITIVE FORCES IN THESE TWO PRINCIPLES THE ENERGY OF THE SOCIAL REFORMER MUST BE DIRECTED ALONG RATIONAL LINES
