712-123615-0000 THE BOWDEN REUNION IT IS VERY RARE IN COUNTRY LIFE
712-123615-0001 THAT ANY OCCASION OF GENERAL INTEREST PROVES TO BE LESS THAN GREAT SUCH IS THE HIDDEN FIRE OF ENTHUSIASM IN THE NEW ENGLAND NATURE THAT ONCE GIVEN AN OUTLET IT SHINES FORTH
712-123615-0002 WITH ALMOST VOLCANIC LIGHT AND HEAT IN QUIET NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH INWARD FORCE DOES NOT WASTE ITSELF UPON THOSE PETTY EXCITEMENTS OF EVERY DAY THAT BELONG TO CITIES
712-123615-0003 BUT WHEN AT LONG INTERVALS THE ALTARS TO PATRIOTISM TO FRIENDSHIP TO THE TIES OF KINDRED ARE REARED IN OUR FAMILIAR FIELDS THEN THE FIRES GLOW THE FLAMES COME UP
712-123615-0004 AS IF FROM THE INEXHAUSTIBLE BURNING HEART OF THE EARTH THE PRIMAL FIRES BREAK THROUGH THE GRANITE DUST IN WHICH OUR SOULS ARE SET EACH HEART IS WARM AND EVERY FACE SHINES WITH THE ANCIENT LIGHT
712-123615-0005 SUCH A DAY AS THIS HAS TRANSFIGURING POWERS AND EASILY MAKES FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN COLD HEARTED AND GIVES TO THOSE WHO ARE DUMB THEIR CHANCE TO SPEAK
712-123615-0006 AND LENDS SOME BEAUTY TO THE PLAINEST FACE OH I EXPECT I SHALL MEET FRIENDS TODAY THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN IN A LONG WHILE SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH DEEP SATISFACTION
712-123615-0007 TWILL BRING OUT A GOOD MANY OF THE OLD FOLKS TIS SUCH A LOVELY DAY I'M ALWAYS GLAD NOT TO HAVE THEM DISAPPOINTED
712-123615-0008 STEALING A GLANCE AT ME THERE'S ONE THING CERTAIN THERE'S NOTHING TAKES IN THIS WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE ANYTHING RELATED TO THE BOWDENS YES I DO FEEL
712-123615-0009 THAT WHEN YOU CALL UPON THE BOWDENS YOU MAY EXPECT MOST FAMILIES TO RISE UP BETWEEN THE LANDING AND THE FAR END OF THE BACK COVE THOSE THAT AREN'T KIN BY BLOOD ARE KIN BY MARRIAGE
712-123615-0010 THERE USED TO BE AN OLD STORY GOIN ABOUT WHEN I WAS A GIRL SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT THERE WAS A GREAT MANY MORE BOWDENS THEN THAN THERE ARE NOW AND THE FOLKS
712-123615-0011 WAS ALL SETTING IN MEETING A DREADFUL HOT SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND A SCATTER WITTED LITTLE BOUND GIRL CAME RUNNING TO THE MEETIN' HOUSE DOOR ALL OUT O BREATH FROM SOMEWHERES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD MIS BOWDEN MIS BOWDEN
712-123615-0012 YOUR BABY'S IN A FIT THEY USED TO TELL THAT THE WHOLE CONGREGATION WAS UP ON ITS FEET IN A MINUTE AND RIGHT OUT INTO THE AISLES ALL THE MIS BOWDENS WAS SETTING RIGHT OUT FOR HOME
712-123615-0013 THE MINISTER STOOD THERE IN THE PULPIT TRYIN TO KEEP SOBER AN ALL AT ONCE HE BURST RIGHT OUT LAUGHIN HE WAS A VERY NICE MAN THEY SAID AND HE SAID HE'D BETTER GIVE EM THE BENEDICTION AND THEY COULD HEAR THE SERMON NEXT SUNDAY
712-123615-0014 SO HE KEPT IT OVER MY MOTHER WAS THERE AND SHE THOUGHT CERTAIN TWAS ME NONE OF OUR FAMILY WAS EVER SUBJECT TO FITS INTERRUPTED MISSUS TODD SEVERELY NO
712-123615-0015 WE NEVER HAD FITS NONE OF US AND TWAS LUCKY WE DIDN'T WAY OUT THERE TO GREEN ISLAND NOW THESE FOLKS RIGHT IN FRONT
712-123615-0016 I'VE HAD TO FAVOR OLD MIS EVINS WITH DRYIN YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS ALL THEM EVINS FOLKS THERE JUST YOU LOOK UP TO THE CROSSROADS MOTHER SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED SEE ALL THE TEAMS AHEAD OF US
712-123615-0017 AND OH LOOK DOWN ON THE BAY YES LOOK DOWN ON THE BAY SEE WHAT A SIGHT O BOATS ALL HEADIN FOR THE BOWDEN PLACE COVE OH AIN'T IT BEAUTIFUL SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH ALL THE DELIGHT OF A GIRL
712-123615-0018 SHE STOOD UP IN THE HIGH WAGON TO SEE EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN SHE TOOK FAST HOLD OF MY HAND HADN'T YOU BETTER URGE THE HORSE A LITTLE ALMIRY SHE ASKED HE'S HAD IT EASY AS WE CAME ALONG
712-123615-0019 AND HE CAN REST WHEN WE GET THERE THE OTHERS ARE SOME LITTLE WAYS AHEAD AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE A MINUTE WE WATCHED THE BOATS DROP THEIR SAILS ONE BY ONE IN THE COVE AS WE DROVE ALONG THE HIGH LAND
712-123615-0020 THE OLD BOWDEN HOUSE STOOD LOW STORIED AND BROAD ROOFED IN ITS GREEN FIELDS AS IF IT WERE A MOTHERLY BROWN HEN WAITING FOR THE FLOCK THAT CAME STRAYING TOWARD IT FROM EVERY DIRECTION THE FIRST BOWDEN SETTLER
712-123615-0021 HAD MADE HIS HOME THERE AND IT WAS STILL THE BOWDEN FARM FIVE GENERATIONS OF SAILORS AND FARMERS AND SOLDIERS HAD BEEN ITS CHILDREN AND PRESENTLY MISSUS BLACKETT
712-123615-0022 SHOWED ME THE STONE WALLED BURYING GROUND THAT STOOD LIKE A LITTLE FORT ON A KNOLL OVERLOOKING THE BAY BUT AS SHE SAID THERE WERE PLENTY OF SCATTERED BOWDENS WHO WERE NOT LAID THERE SOME LOST AT SEA AND SOME OUT WEST
712-123615-0023 AND SOME WHO DIED IN THE WAR MOST OF THE HOME GRAVES WERE THOSE OF WOMEN WE COULD SEE NOW THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENT FOOTPATHS FROM ALONG SHORE AND ACROSS COUNTRY
712-123615-0024 IN ALL THESE THERE WERE STRAGGLING PROCESSIONS WALKING IN SINGLE FILE LIKE OLD ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS THERE WAS A CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE AS IF HUGE BEES WERE SWARMING IN THE LILAC BUSHES
712-123615-0025 BEYOND THE FIELDS AND COVE A HIGHER POINT OF LAND RAN OUT INTO THE BAY COVERED WITH WOODS WHICH MUST HAVE KEPT AWAY MUCH OF THE NORTHWEST WIND IN WINTER
712-123615-0026 NOW THERE WAS A PLEASANT LOOK OF SHADE AND SHELTER THERE FOR THE GREAT FAMILY MEETING WE HURRIED ON OUR WAY BEGINNING TO FEEL AS IF WE WERE VERY LATE AND IT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION
712-123615-0027 AT LAST TO TURN OUT OF THE STONY HIGHROAD INTO A GREEN LANE SHADED WITH OLD APPLE TREES MISSUS TODD ENCOURAGED THE HORSE UNTIL HE FAIRLY PRANCED WITH GAYETY AS WE DROVE ROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE ON THE SOFT TURF
712-123615-0028 THERE WAS AN INSTANT CRY OF REJOICING AND TWO OR THREE PERSONS RAN TOWARD US FROM THE BUSY GROUP WHY DEAR MIS BLACKETT HERE'S MIS BLACKETT I HEARD THEM SAY AS IF IT WERE PLEASURE ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY TO HAVE A SIGHT OF HER
712-123615-0029 MISSUS TODD TURNED TO ME WITH A LOVELY LOOK OF TRIUMPH AND SELF FORGETFULNESS AN ELDERLY MAN WHO WORE THE LOOK OF A PROSPEROUS SEA CAPTAIN PUT UP BOTH ARMS
712-123615-0030 AND LIFTED MISSUS BLACKETT DOWN FROM THE HIGH WAGON LIKE A CHILD AND KISSED HER WITH HEARTY AFFECTION I WAS MASTER AFRAID SHE WOULDN'T BE HERE HE SAID LOOKING AT MISSUS TODD WITH A FACE LIKE A HAPPY SUNBURNT SCHOOLBOY
712-123615-0031 WHILE EVERYBODY CROWDED ROUND TO GIVE THEIR WELCOME MOTHER'S ALWAYS THE QUEEN SAID MISSUS TODD YES THEY'LL ALL MAKE EVERYTHING OF MOTHER SHE'LL HAVE A LOVELY TIME TO DAY I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD HER MISS IT
712-123615-0032 AND THERE WON'T BE A THING SHE'LL EVER REGRET EXCEPT TO MOURN BECAUSE WILLIAM WA'N'T HERE MISSUS BLACKETT HAVING BEEN PROPERLY ESCORTED TO THE HOUSE MISSUS TODD RECEIVED HER OWN FULL SHARE OF HONOR AND SOME OF THE MEN
712-123615-0033 WITH A SIMPLE KINDNESS THAT WAS THE SOUL OF CHIVALRY WAITED UPON US AND OUR BASKETS AND LED AWAY THE WHITE HORSE I ALREADY KNEW SOME OF MISSUS TODD'S FRIENDS AND KINDRED AND FELT LIKE AN ADOPTED BOWDEN IN THIS HAPPY MOMENT
712-123615-0034 WHO PRESENTLY HAD HER COURT INSIDE THE HOUSE WHILE MISSUS TODD LARGE HOSPITABLE AND PREEMINENT WAS THE CENTRE OF A RAPIDLY INCREASING CROWD ABOUT THE LILAC BUSHES
712-123615-0035 SMALL COMPANIES WERE CONTINUALLY COMING UP THE LONG GREEN SLOPE FROM THE WATER AND NEARLY ALL THE BOATS HAD COME TO SHORE
712-123615-0036 I COUNTED THREE OR FOUR THAT WERE BAFFLED BY THE LIGHT BREEZE BUT BEFORE LONG ALL THE BOWDENS SMALL AND GREAT SEEMED TO HAVE ASSEMBLED AND WE STARTED TO GO UP TO THE GROVE ACROSS THE FIELD
712-123615-0037 OUT OF THE CHATTERING CROWD OF NOISY CHILDREN AND LARGE WAISTED WOMEN WHOSE BEST BLACK DRESSES FELL STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND IN GENEROUS FOLDS AND SUNBURNT MEN WHO LOOKED AS SERIOUS AS IF IT WERE TOWN MEETING DAY
712-123615-0038 THERE SUDDENLY CAME SILENCE AND ORDER I SAW THE STRAIGHT SOLDIERLY LITTLE FIGURE OF A MAN WHO BORE A FINE RESEMBLANCE TO MISSUS BLACKETT AND WHO APPEARED TO MARSHAL US WITH PERFECT EASE HE WAS IMPERATIVE ENOUGH
712-123615-0039 BUT WITH A GRAND MILITARY SORT OF COURTESY AND BORE HIMSELF WITH SOLEMN DIGNITY OF IMPORTANCE WE WERE SORTED OUT ACCORDING TO SOME CLEAR DESIGN OF HIS OWN AND STOOD AS SPEECHLESS AS A TROOP TO AWAIT HIS ORDERS
712-123615-0040 EVEN THE CHILDREN WERE READY TO MARCH TOGETHER A PRETTY FLOCK AND AT THE LAST MOMENT MISSUS BLACKETT AND A FEW DISTINGUISHED COMPANIONS THE MINISTERS AND THOSE WHO WERE VERY OLD CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND TOOK THEIR PLACES
712-123615-0041 WE RANKED BY FOURS AND EVEN THEN WE MADE A LONG PROCESSION THERE WAS A WIDE PATH MOWED FOR US ACROSS THE FIELD AND AS WE MOVED ALONG
712-123615-0042 THE BIRDS FLEW UP OUT OF THE THICK SECOND CROP OF CLOVER AND THE BEES HUMMED
712-123615-0043 THERE WAS A FLASHING OF WHITE GULLS OVER THE WATER WHERE THE FLEET OF BOATS RODE THE LOW WAVES TOGETHER IN THE COVE SWAYING THEIR SMALL MASTS AS IF THEY KEPT TIME TO OUR STEPS
712-123615-0044 YET STILL BE HEARD WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COMPANY OF ANCIENT GREEKS GOING TO CELEBRATE A VICTORY OR TO WORSHIP THE GOD OF HARVESTS IN THE GROVE ABOVE IT WAS STRANGELY MOVING TO SEE THIS AND TO MAKE PART OF IT
712-123615-0045 THE SKY THE SEA HAVE WATCHED POOR HUMANITY AT ITS RITES SO LONG WE WERE NO MORE A NEW ENGLAND FAMILY CELEBRATING ITS OWN EXISTENCE AND SIMPLE PROGRESS
712-123615-0046 WE CARRIED THE TOKENS AND INHERITANCE OF ALL SUCH HOUSEHOLDS FROM WHICH THIS HAD DESCENDED AND WERE ONLY THE LATEST OF OUR LINE WE POSSESSED THE INSTINCTS OF A FAR FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD
712-123615-0047 I FOUND MYSELF THINKING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE CARRYING GREEN BRANCHES AND SINGING AS WE WENT
712-123615-0048 THERE WAS A THICK GROWTH OF DARK PINES AND FIRS WITH AN OCCASIONAL MAPLE OR OAK THAT GAVE A GLEAM OF COLOR LIKE A BRIGHT WINDOW IN THE GREAT ROOF ON THREE SIDES WE COULD SEE THE WATER SHINING BEHIND THE TREE TRUNKS
712-123615-0049 AND FEEL THE COOL SALT BREEZE
712-123615-0050 JUST AS THE DAY REACHED ITS HIGHEST POINT OF HEAT WE COULD SEE THE GREEN SUNLIT FIELD WE HAD JUST CROSSED AS IF WE LOOKED OUT AT IT FROM A DARK ROOM
712-123615-0051 AND THE OLD HOUSE AND ITS LILACS STANDING PLACIDLY IN THE SUN AND THE GREAT BARN WITH A STOCKADE OF CARRIAGES FROM WHICH TWO OR THREE CARE TAKING MEN WHO HAD LINGERED WERE COMING ACROSS THE FIELD TOGETHER
712-123615-0052 MISSUS TODD HAD TAKEN OFF HER WARM GLOVES AND LOOKED THE PICTURE OF CONTENT THERE SHE EXCLAIMED I'VE ALWAYS MEANT TO HAVE YOU SEE THIS PLACE BUT I NEVER LOOKED FOR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY
712-123615-0053 WEATHER AN OCCASION BOTH MADE TO MATCH YES IT SUITS ME I DON'T ASK NO MORE I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU SAW MOTHER WALKIN AT THE HEAD IT CHOKED ME RIGHT UP TO SEE MOTHER AT THE HEAD WALKIN WITH THE MINISTERS
712-123615-0054 TURNED AWAY TO HIDE THE FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT INSTANTLY CONTROL WHO WAS THE MARSHAL I HASTENED TO ASK WAS HE AN OLD SOLDIER DON'T HE DO WELL ANSWERED MISSUS TODD WITH SATISFACTION
712-123615-0055 HE DON'T OFTEN HAVE SUCH A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF HIS GIFTS SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A FRIEND FROM THE LANDING WHO HAD JOINED US THAT'S SANT BOWDEN HE ALWAYS TAKES THE LEAD SUCH DAYS
712-123615-0056 GOOD FOR NOTHING ELSE MOST O HIS TIME TROUBLE IS HE I TURNED WITH INTEREST TO HEAR THE WORST MISSUS CAPLIN'S TONE WAS BOTH ZEALOUS AND IMPRESSIVE STIM'LATES SHE EXPLAINED SCORNFULLY
712-123615-0057 NO SANTIN NEVER WAS IN THE WAR SAID MISSUS TODD WITH LOFTY INDIFFERENCE IT WAS A CAUSE OF REAL DISTRESS TO HIM HE KEP ENLISTIN AND TRAVELED FAR AN WIDE ABOUT HERE AN EVEN TOOK THE BO'T
712-123615-0058 AND WENT TO BOSTON TO VOLUNTEER BUT HE AIN'T A SOUND MAN AN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HIM THEY SAY HE KNOWS ALL THEIR TACTICS AN CAN TELL ALL ABOUT THE BATTLE O WATERLOO WELL'S HE CAN BUNKER HILL
712-123615-0059 I TOLD HIM ONCE THE COUNTRY'D LOST A GREAT GENERAL AN I MEANT IT TOO I EXPECT YOU'RE NEAR RIGHT SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A LITTLE CRESTFALLEN AND APOLOGETIC I BE RIGHT INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH MUCH
712-123615-0060 AMIABILITY TWAS MOST TOO BAD TO CRAMP HIM DOWN TO HIS PEACEFUL TRADE BUT HE'S A MOST EXCELLENT SHOEMAKER AT HIS BEST AN HE ALWAYS SAYS IT'S A TRADE THAT GIVES HIM TIME TO THINK AN PLAN HIS MANEUVERS
712-123615-0061 OVER TO THE PORT THEY ALWAYS INVITE HIM TO MARCH DECORATION DAY SAME AS THE REST AN HE DOES LOOK NOBLE HE COMES OF SOLDIER STOCK
712-123615-0062 I HAD BEEN NOTICING WITH GREAT INTEREST THE CURIOUSLY FRENCH TYPE OF FACE WHICH PREVAILED IN THIS RUSTIC COMPANY I HAD SAID TO MYSELF BEFORE THAT MISSUS BLACKETT WAS PLAINLY OF FRENCH DESCENT
712-123615-0063 IN BOTH HER APPEARANCE AND HER CHARMING GIFTS
712-123615-0064 ON THIS NORTHERN COAST OF NEW ENGLAND WERE OF HUGUENOT BLOOD AND THAT IT IS THE NORMAN ENGLISHMAN NOT THE SAXON WHO GOES ADVENTURING TO A NEW WORLD THEY USED TO SAY IN OLD TIMES SAID MISSUS TODD MODESTLY
712-123615-0065 THAT OUR FAMILY CAME OF VERY HIGH FOLKS IN FRANCE AND ONE OF EM WAS A GREAT GENERAL IN SOME O THE OLD WARS I SOMETIMES THINK THAT SANTIN'S ABILITY HAS COME WAY DOWN FROM THEN TAIN'T NOTHIN HE'S EVER ACQUIRED
712-123615-0066 TWAS BORN IN HIM I DON'T KNOW'S HE EVER SAW A FINE PARADE OR MET WITH THOSE THAT STUDIED UP SUCH THINGS HE'S FIGURED IT ALL OUT AN GOT HIS PAPERS SO HE KNOWS HOW TO AIM A CANNON

712-123615-0068 BUT HE WILL HAVE THOSE POOR GLOOMY SPELLS COME OVER HIM NOW AN THEN AN THEN HE HAS TO DRINK MISSUS CAPLIN GAVE A HEAVY SIGH THERE'S A GREAT MANY SUCH STRAYAWAY FOLKS
712-123615-0069 JUST AS THERE IS PLANTS CONTINUED MISSUS TODD WHO WAS NOTHING IF NOT BOTANICAL I KNOW OF JUST ONE SPRIG OF LAUREL THAT GROWS OVER BACK HERE IN A WILD SPOT
712-123615-0070 AN I NEVER COULD HEAR OF NO OTHER ON THIS COAST I HAD A LARGE BUNCH BROUGHT ME ONCE FROM MASSACHUSETTS WAY SO I KNOW IT THIS PIECE GROWS IN AN OPEN SPOT WHERE YOU'D THINK TWOULD DO WELL BUT IT'S SORT O POOR LOOKIN
712-123615-0071 I'VE VISITED IT TIME AN AGAIN JUST TO NOTICE ITS POOR BLOOMS TIS A REAL SANT BOWDEN OUT OF ITS OWN PLACE MISSUS CAPLIN LOOKED BEWILDERED AND BLANK WELL ALL I KNOW IS
712-123615-0072 CONFERENCE IN PLATOONS AND GOT EM ALL FLUSTERED UP TRYIN TO SENSE HIS IDEAS OF A HOLLER SQUARE SHE BURST FORTH
712-123615-0073 AND THEY'D BEEN TREATED TO A SERMON ON FAITH AN WORKS FROM OLD FAYTHER HARLOW THAT NEVER KNOWS WHEN TO CEASE TWA'N'T NO TIME FOR TACTICS THEN THEY WA'N'T A'THINKIN OF THE CHURCH MILITARY SANT

712-123615-0075 AIN'T I JUST BEEN MAINTAININ THAT HE AIN'T LIKE EM URGED MISSUS TODD DECIDEDLY STRANGE FOLKS HAS GOT TO HAVE STRANGE WAYS FOR WHAT I SEE
712-123615-0076 SOMEBODY OBSERVED ONCE THAT YOU COULD PICK OUT THE LIKENESS OF MOST EVERY SORT OF A FOREIGNER WHEN YOU LOOKED ABOUT YOU IN OUR PARISH SAID SISTER CAPLIN HER FACE BRIGHTENING WITH SUDDEN ILLUMINATION I DIDN'T SEE THE BEARIN OF IT THEN QUITE SO PLAIN
712-123615-0077 I ALWAYS DID THINK MARI HARRIS RESEMBLED A CHINEE MARI HARRIS WAS PRETTY AS A CHILD I REMEMBER SAID THE PLEASANT VOICE OF MISSUS BLACKETT WHO AFTER RECEIVING THE AFFECTIONATE GREETINGS OF NEARLY THE WHOLE COMPANY
712-123615-0078 CAME TO JOIN US TO SEE AS SHE INSISTED THAT WE WERE OUT OF MISCHIEF YES MARI WAS ONE O THEM PRETTY LITTLE LAMBS THAT MAKE DREADFUL HOMELY OLD SHEEP REPLIED MISSUS TODD WITH ENERGY CAP'N LITTLEPAGE
712-123615-0079 NEVER'D LOOK SO DISCONSOLATE IF SHE WAS ANY SORT OF A PROPER PERSON TO DIRECT THINGS SHE MIGHT DIVERT HIM YES SHE MIGHT DIVERT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AN LET HIM THINK HE HAD HIS OWN WAY STEAD O ARGUING EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE BARE BONE
712-123615-0080 TWOULDN'T HURT HER TO SIT DOWN AN HEAR HIS GREAT STORIES ONCE IN A WHILE THE STORIES ARE VERY INTERESTING I VENTURED TO SAY YES YOU ALWAYS CATCH YOURSELF A THINKIN WHAT IF THEY ALL WAS TRUE AND HE HAD THE RIGHT OF IT
712-123615-0081 ANSWERED MISSUS TODD HE'S A GOOD SIGHT BETTER COMPANY THOUGH DREAMY THAN SUCH SORDID CREATUR'S AS MARI HARRIS LIVE AND LET LIVE SAID DEAR OLD MISSUS BLACKETT GENTLY I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CAPTAIN FOR A GOOD WHILE
712-123615-0082 SHE ADDED WISTFULLY WE ALWAYS HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER WHY IF IT IS A GOOD PLEASANT DAY TOMORROW
712-123615-0083 THERE THEY'RE CALLIN OUT IT'S TIME TO SET THE TABLES SAID MISSUS CAPLIN WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT HERE'S COUSIN SARAH JANE BLACKETT WELL I AM PLEASED CERTAIN
712-123615-0084 EXCLAIMED MISSUS TODD WITH UNAFFECTED DELIGHT AND THESE KINDRED SPIRITS MET AND PARTED WITH THE PROMISE OF A GOOD TALK LATER ON AFTER THIS
712-123615-0085 THERE WAS NO MORE TIME FOR CONVERSATION UNTIL WE WERE SEATED IN ORDER AT THE LONG TABLES I'M ONE THAT ALWAYS DREADS SEEING SOME O THE FOLKS THAT I DON'T LIKE AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS
712-123615-0086 AFTER A SEASON OF REFLECTION WE WERE JUST WAITING FOR THE FEAST TO BEGIN
712-123615-0087 I REMEMBER THE DAY I PROMISED TO NATHAN HOW IT COME OVER ME
712-123615-0088 AN IT SEEMED AS IF DIE I SHOULD POOR NATHAN SAW SOMETHIN HAD CROSSED ME HE HAD VERY NICE FEELINGS
712-123615-0089 I TOLD HIM I NEVER COULD LIKE HER MYSELF SAID HE YOU SHA'N'T BE BOTHERED DEAR HE SAYS AN TWAS ONE O THE THINGS THAT MADE ME SET A GOOD DEAL BY NATHAN
712-123615-0090 YES SAYS I BUT THINK O THANKSGIVIN TIMES AN FUNERALS SHE'S OUR RELATION AN WE'VE GOT TO OWN HER YOUNG FOLKS DON'T THINK O THOSE THINGS
712-123615-0091 SAID MISSUS TODD WITH AN ALARMING TRANSITION FROM GENERAL OPINIONS TO PARTICULAR ANIMOSITIES I HATE HER JUST THE SAME AS I ALWAYS DID
712-123615-0092 I DO TRY TO REMEMBER THAT SHE'S NATHAN'S COUSIN OH DEAR WELL SHE'S GONE BY AFTER ALL AN AIN'T SEEN ME I EXPECTED SHE'D COME PLEASANTIN ROUND JUST TO SHOW OFF AN SAY AFTERWARDS SHE WAS ACQUAINTED
712-123615-0093 THIS WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM MISSUS TODD'S USUAL LARGENESS OF MIND THAT I HAD A MOMENT'S UNEASINESS BUT THE CLOUD PASSED QUICKLY OVER HER SPIRIT AND WAS GONE WITH THE OFFENDER
712-123615-0094 THERE NEVER WAS A MORE GENEROUS OUT OF DOOR FEAST ALONG THE COAST THEN THE BOWDEN FAMILY SET FORTH THAT DAY TO CALL IT A PICNIC WOULD MAKE IT SEEM TRIVIAL
712-123615-0095 WHICH THE BOYS AND GIRLS MADE WE BROUGHT FLOWERS FROM THE FENCE THICKETS OF THE GREAT FIELD AND OUT OF THE DISORDER OF FLOWERS AND PROVISIONS SUDDENLY APPEARED AS ORDERLY A SCHEME FOR THE FEAST AS THE MARSHAL HAD SHAPED FOR THE PROCESSION
712-123615-0096 I BEGAN TO RESPECT THE BOWDENS FOR THEIR INHERITANCE OF GOOD TASTE AND SKILL AND A CERTAIN PLEASING GIFT OF FORMALITY SOMETHING MADE THEM DO ALL THESE THINGS IN A FINER WAY THAN MOST COUNTRY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DONE THEM
712-123615-0097 AS I LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE TABLES THERE WAS A GOOD CHEER A GRAVE SOBERNESS THAT SHONE WITH PLEASURE A HUMBLE DIGNITY OF BEARING THERE WERE SOME WHO SHOULD HAVE SAT BELOW THE SALT FOR LACK OF THIS GOOD BREEDING
712-123615-0098 BUT THEY WERE NOT MANY SO I SAID TO MYSELF THEIR ANCESTORS MAY HAVE SAT IN THE GREAT HALL OF SOME OLD FRENCH HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN BATTLES AND SIEGES AND PROCESSIONS AND FEASTS
712-123615-0099 WERE FAMILIAR THINGS THE MINISTERS AND MISSUS BLACKETT WITH A FEW OF THEIR RANK AND AGE WERE PUT IN PLACES OF HONOR AND FOR ONCE THAT I LOOKED ANY OTHER WAY I LOOKED TWICE AT MISSUS BLACKETT'S FACE
712-123615-0100 SERENE AND MINDFUL OF PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSIBILITY THE MISTRESS BY SIMPLE FITNESS OF THIS GREAT DAY MISSUS TODD LOOKED UP AT THE ROOF OF GREEN TREES AND THEN CAREFULLY SURVEYED THE COMPANY
712-123615-0101 I SEE EM BETTER NOW THEY'RE ALL SETTIN DOWN SHE SAID WITH SATISFACTION
712-123615-0102 I WISH THEY WERE SITTIN WITH US THEY'RE NOT AMONG FOLKS THEY CAN PARLEY WITH AN THEY LOOK DISAPPOINTED AS THE FEAST WENT ON THE SPIRITS OF MY COMPANION STEADILY ROSE
712-123615-0103 THE EXCITEMENT OF AN UNEXPECTEDLY GREAT OCCASION WAS A SUBTLE STIMULANT TO HER DISPOSITION AND I COULD SEE THAT SOMETIMES WHEN MISSUS TODD HAD SEEMED LIMITED AND HEAVILY DOMESTIC
712-123615-0104 SHE HAD SIMPLY GROWN SLUGGISH FOR LACK OF PROPER SURROUNDINGS SHE WAS NOT SO MUCH REMINISCENT NOW AS EXPECTANT AND AS ALERT AND GAY AS A GIRL WE WHO WERE HER NEIGHBORS WERE FULL OF GAYETY
712-123615-0105 WHICH WAS BUT THE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM HER BEAMING COUNTENANCE IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS FULL OF WONDER AT THE WASTE OF HUMAN ABILITY IN THIS WORLD AS A BOTANIST WONDERS AT THE WASTEFULNESS OF NATURE THE THOUSAND SEEDS THAT DIE
712-123615-0106 THE UNUSED PROVISION OF EVERY SORT THE RESERVE FORCE OF SOCIETY GROWS MORE AND MORE AMAZING TO ONE'S THOUGHT MORE THAN ONE FACE AMONG THE BOWDENS SHOWED THAT ONLY OPPORTUNITY AND STIMULUS WERE LACKING
712-123615-0107 AND HELD IT CAPTIVE ONE SEES EXACTLY THE SAME TYPES IN A COUNTRY GATHERING AS IN THE MOST BRILLIANT CITY COMPANY
