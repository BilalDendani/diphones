1168-134958-0000 THERE WAS A POOR HUSBANDMAN WHO HAD MANY CHILDREN AND LITTLE TO GIVE THEM IN THE WAY EITHER OF FOOD OR CLOTHING THEY WERE ALL PRETTY BUT THE PRETTIEST OF ALL WAS THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER WHO WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
1168-134958-0001 THAT THERE WERE NO BOUNDS TO HER BEAUTY SO ONCE IT WAS LATE ON A THURSDAY EVENING IN AUTUMN AND WILD WEATHER OUTSIDE TERRIBLY DARK
1168-134958-0002 AND RAINING SO HEAVILY AND BLOWING SO HARD THAT THE WALLS OF THE COTTAGE SHOOK AGAIN THEY WERE ALL SITTING TOGETHER BY THE FIRESIDE EACH OF THEM BUSY WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER
1168-134958-0003 WHEN SUDDENLY SOME ONE RAPPED THREE TIMES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE THE MAN WENT OUT TO SEE WHAT COULD BE THE MATTER AND WHEN HE GOT OUT THERE STOOD A GREAT BIG WHITE BEAR
1168-134958-0004 WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SAID THE WHITE BEAR IF YOU WILL YOU SHALL BE AS RICH AS YOU ARE NOW POOR TRULY THE MAN WOULD HAVE HAD NO OBJECTION TO BE RICH
1168-134958-0005 BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
1168-134958-0006 WHO HAD FAITHFULLY PROMISED TO MAKE THEM ALL RICH IF HE MIGHT BUT HAVE THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SHE SAID NO AND WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT SO THE MAN WENT OUT AGAIN AND SETTLED WITH THE WHITE BEAR
1168-134958-0007 THAT HE SHOULD COME AGAIN NEXT THURSDAY EVENING AND GET HER ANSWER THEN THE MAN PERSUADED HER AND TALKED SO MUCH TO HER ABOUT THE WEALTH THAT THEY WOULD HAVE AND WHAT A GOOD THING IT WOULD BE FOR HERSELF
1168-134958-0008 AND WASHED AND MENDED ALL HER RAGS MADE HERSELF AS SMART AS SHE COULD AND HELD HERSELF IN READINESS TO SET OUT LITTLE ENOUGH HAD SHE TO TAKE AWAY WITH HER NEXT THURSDAY EVENING
1168-134958-0009 THE WHITE BEAR CAME TO FETCH HER SHE SEATED HERSELF ON HIS BACK WITH HER BUNDLE AND THUS THEY DEPARTED WHEN THEY HAD GONE A GREAT PART OF THE WAY THE WHITE BEAR SAID ARE YOU AFRAID
1168-134958-0010 THAT I AM NOT SAID SHE KEEP TIGHT HOLD OF MY FUR AND THEN THERE IS NO DANGER SAID HE AND THUS SHE RODE FAR FAR AWAY
1168-134958-0011 UNTIL THEY CAME TO A GREAT MOUNTAIN THEN THE WHITE BEAR KNOCKED ON IT AND A DOOR OPENED AND THEY WENT INTO A CASTLE WHERE THERE WERE MANY BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED ROOMS
1168-134958-0012 WHICH SHONE WITH GOLD AND SILVER LIKEWISE A LARGE HALL IN WHICH THERE WAS A WELL SPREAD TABLE AND IT WAS SO MAGNIFICENT
1168-134958-0013 THAT IT WOULD BE HARD TO MAKE ANYONE UNDERSTAND HOW SPLENDID IT WAS THE WHITE BEAR GAVE HER A SILVER BELL AND TOLD HER THAT WHEN SHE NEEDED ANYTHING SHE HAD BUT TO RING THIS BELL
1168-134958-0014 AND WHAT SHE WANTED WOULD APPEAR SO AFTER SHE HAD EATEN AND NIGHT WAS DRAWING NEAR SHE GREW SLEEPY AFTER HER JOURNEY AND THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO BED
1168-134958-0015 SHE RANG THE BELL AND SCARCELY HAD SHE TOUCHED IT BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELF IN A CHAMBER WHERE A BED STOOD READY MADE FOR HER WHICH WAS AS PRETTY AS ANYONE COULD WISH TO SLEEP IN
1168-134958-0016 IT HAD PILLOWS OF SILK AND CURTAINS OF SILK FRINGED WITH GOLD AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE ROOM WAS OF GOLD OR SILVER BUT WHEN SHE HAD LAIN DOWN AND PUT OUT THE LIGHT
1168-134958-0017 A MAN CAME AND LAY DOWN BESIDE HER AND BEHOLD IT WAS THE WHITE BEAR WHO CAST OFF THE FORM OF A BEAST DURING THE NIGHT SHE NEVER SAW HIM HOWEVER
1168-134958-0018 FOR HE ALWAYS CAME AFTER SHE HAD PUT OUT HER LIGHT AND WENT AWAY BEFORE DAYLIGHT APPEARED SO ALL WENT WELL AND HAPPILY FOR A TIME BUT THEN SHE BEGAN TO BE VERY SAD AND SORROWFUL
1168-134958-0019 FOR ALL DAY LONG SHE HAD TO GO ABOUT ALONE AND SHE DID SO WISH TO GO HOME TO HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS THEN THE WHITE BEAR ASKED WHAT IT WAS THAT SHE WANTED AND SHE TOLD HIM
1168-134958-0020 THAT IT WAS SO DULL THERE IN THE MOUNTAIN AND THAT SHE HAD TO GO ABOUT ALL ALONE AND THAT IN HER PARENTS HOUSE AT HOME THERE WERE ALL HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND IT WAS BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT GO TO THEM THAT SHE WAS SO SORROWFUL
1168-134958-0021 IF YOU WOULD BUT PROMISE ME NEVER TO TALK WITH YOUR MOTHER ALONE BUT ONLY WHEN THE OTHERS ARE THERE TOO
1168-134958-0022 BUT THAT YOU MUST BY NO MEANS DO OR YOU WILL BRING GREAT MISERY ON BOTH OF US SO ONE SUNDAY THE WHITE BEAR CAME AND SAID THAT THEY COULD NOW SET OUT TO SEE HER FATHER AND MOTHER
1168-134958-0023 AND THEY JOURNEYED THITHER SHE SITTING ON HIS BACK AND THEY WENT A LONG LONG WAY AND IT TOOK A LONG LONG TIME BUT AT LAST THEY CAME TO A LARGE WHITE FARMHOUSE
1168-134958-0024 AND HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE RUNNING ABOUT OUTSIDE IT PLAYING AND IT WAS SO PRETTY THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT IT
1168-134958-0025 BUT DO NOT FORGET WHAT I SAID TO YOU OR YOU WILL DO MUCH HARM BOTH TO YOURSELF AND ME NO INDEED SAID SHE I SHALL NEVER FORGET
1168-134958-0026 AND AS SOON AS SHE WAS AT HOME THE WHITE BEAR TURNED ROUND AND WENT BACK AGAIN THERE WERE SUCH REJOICINGS WHEN SHE WENT IN TO HER PARENTS THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER COME TO AN END
1168-134958-0027 AND EVERYTHING WAS AS GOOD AS IT COULD BE THEY ALL ASKED HER HOW SHE WAS GETTING ON WHERE SHE WAS ALL WAS WELL WITH HER TOO SHE SAID AND SHE HAD EVERYTHING THAT SHE COULD WANT WHAT OTHER ANSWERS SHE GAVE
1168-134958-0028 I CANNOT SAY BUT I AM PRETTY SURE THAT THEY DID NOT LEARN MUCH FROM HER BUT IN THE AFTERNOON AFTER THEY HAD DINED AT MIDDAY ALL HAPPENED
1168-134958-0029 HER MOTHER WANTED TO TALK WITH HER ALONE IN HER OWN CHAMBER BUT SHE REMEMBERED WHAT THE WHITE BEAR HAD SAID AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT GO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY CAN BE SAID AT ANY TIME
1168-134958-0030 SHE ANSWERED BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HER MOTHER AT LAST PERSUADED HER
1168-134958-0031 THE WHITE BEAR ASKED HER IF EVERYTHING HAD NOT HAPPENED JUST AS HE HAD FORETOLD AND SHE COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT IT HAD THEN IF YOU HAVE DONE WHAT YOUR MOTHER WISHED
1168-134958-0032 SAID HE YOU HAVE BROUGHT GREAT MISERY ON BOTH OF US NO SHE SAID
1168-134958-0033 AND HAD GONE TO BED IT WAS JUST THE SAME AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE AND A MAN CAME AND LAY DOWN BESIDE HER AND LATE AT NIGHT WHEN SHE COULD HEAR THAT HE WAS SLEEPING SHE GOT UP AND KINDLED A LIGHT
1168-134958-0034 LIT HER CANDLE LET HER LIGHT SHINE ON HIM AND SAW HIM AND HE WAS THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE THAT EYES HAD EVER BEHELD
1168-134958-0035 AND SHE LOVED HIM SO MUCH THAT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE MUST DIE IF SHE DID NOT KISS HIM THAT VERY MOMENT SO SHE DID KISS HIM
1168-134958-0036 BUT WHILE SHE WAS DOING IT SHE LET THREE DROPS OF HOT TALLOW FALL UPON HIS SHIRT AND HE AWOKE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW
1168-134958-0037 SAID HE YOU HAVE BROUGHT MISERY ON BOTH OF US IF YOU HAD BUT HELD OUT FOR THE SPACE OF ONE YEAR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE
1168-134958-0038 I HAVE A STEP MOTHER WHO HAS BEWITCHED ME SO THAT I AM A WHITE BEAR BY DAY AND A MAN BY NIGHT BUT NOW ALL IS AT AN END BETWEEN YOU AND ME
1168-134958-0039 AND I MUST LEAVE YOU AND GO TO HER
1168-134958-0040 AND WEST OF THE MOON AND THERE TOO IS A PRINCESS WITH A NOSE WHICH IS THREE ELLS LONG
1168-134958-0041 SHE WEPT AND LAMENTED BUT ALL IN VAIN FOR GO HE MUST

1168-134958-0043 YOU MAY DO THAT SAID HE BUT THERE IS NO WAY THITHER IT LIES EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
1168-134958-0044 AND NEVER WOULD YOU FIND YOUR WAY THERE WHEN SHE AWOKE IN THE MORNING BOTH THE PRINCE AND THE CASTLE WERE GONE
1168-134958-0045 AND SHE WAS LYING ON A SMALL GREEN PATCH IN THE MIDST OF A DARK THICK WOOD BY HER SIDE LAY THE SELF SAME BUNDLE OF RAGS WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER FROM HER OWN HOME
1168-134958-0046 SO WHEN SHE HAD RUBBED THE SLEEP OUT OF HER EYES AND WEPT TILL SHE WAS WEARY SHE SET OUT ON HER WAY
1168-134958-0047 UNTIL AT LAST SHE CAME TO A GREAT MOUNTAIN OUTSIDE IT AN AGED WOMAN WAS SITTING PLAYING WITH A GOLDEN APPLE
1168-134958-0048 THE GIRL ASKED HER IF SHE KNEW THE WAY TO THE PRINCE WHO LIVED WITH HIS STEPMOTHER IN THE CASTLE
1168-134958-0049 SO IT IS YOU THEN SAID THE OLD WOMAN

1168-134958-0052 WHEN YOU HAVE GOT THERE
1168-134958-0053 BENEATH THE LEFT EAR AND BID IT GO HOME AGAIN BUT YOU MAY TAKE THE GOLDEN APPLE WITH YOU SO THE GIRL SEATED HERSELF ON THE HORSE AND RODE FOR A LONG LONG WAY

1168-134958-0055 IF EVER YOU GET THERE AT ALL BUT YOU SHALL HAVE THE LOAN OF MY HORSE TO AN OLD WOMAN WHO LIVES THE NEAREST TO ME PERHAPS SHE MAY KNOW WHERE THE CASTLE IS AND WHEN YOU HAVE GOT TO HER
1168-134958-0056 YOU MAY JUST STRIKE THE HORSE BENEATH THE LEFT EAR AND BID IT GO HOME AGAIN THEN SHE GAVE HER THE GOLD CARDING COMB FOR IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE OF USE TO HER SHE SAID
1168-134958-0057 SO THE GIRL SEATED HERSELF ON THE HORSE
1168-134958-0058 SHE CAME TO A GREAT MOUNTAIN WHERE AN AGED WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING AT A GOLDEN SPINNING WHEEL OF THIS WOMAN TOO SHE INQUIRED IF SHE KNEW THE WAY TO THE PRINCE
1168-134958-0059 AND WHERE TO FIND THE CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON BUT IT WAS ONLY THE SAME THING ONCE AGAIN

1168-134958-0062 PERHAPS HE MAY KNOW WHERE THE CASTLE IS AND WILL BLOW YOU THITHER BUT WHEN YOU HAVE GOT TO HIM YOU MUST JUST STRIKE THE HORSE BENEATH THE LEFT EAR AND HE WILL COME HOME AGAIN AND THEN SHE GAVE HER THE GOLDEN SPINNING WHEEL
1168-134958-0063 SAYING PERHAPS YOU MAY FIND THAT YOU HAVE A USE FOR IT THE GIRL HAD TO RIDE FOR A GREAT MANY DAYS AND FOR A LONG AND WEARISOME TIME BEFORE SHE GOT THERE
1168-134958-0064 BUT AT LAST SHE DID ARRIVE AND THEN SHE ASKED THE EAST WIND IF HE COULD TELL HER THE WAY TO THE PRINCE WHO DWELT EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON WELL SAID THE EAST WIND
1168-134958-0065 HE MAY KNOW THAT
1168-134958-0066 SO SHE SEATED HERSELF ON HIS BACK AND THEY DID GO SO SWIFTLY
1168-134958-0067 THE EAST WIND WENT IN AND SAID THAT THE GIRL WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT WAS THE ONE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE HAD THE PRINCE UP AT THE CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON AND THAT NOW SHE WAS TRAVELING ABOUT TO FIND HIM AGAIN
1168-134958-0068 SO HE HAD COME THERE WITH HER AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IF THE WEST WIND KNEW WHEREABOUT THE CASTLE WAS
1168-134958-0069 BUT IF YOU LIKE I WILL GO WITH YOU TO THE SOUTH WIND
1168-134958-0070 AND PERHAPS HE CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW
1168-134958-0071 SO SHE DID THIS AND JOURNEYED TO THE SOUTH WIND NEITHER WAS SHE VERY LONG ON THE WAY WHEN THEY HAD GOT THERE THE WEST WIND ASKED HIM IF HE COULD TELL HER THE WAY TO THE CASTLE
1168-134958-0072 THAT LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON FOR SHE WAS THE GIRL WHO OUGHT TO MARRY THE PRINCE WHO LIVED THERE
1168-134958-0073 WELL SAID HE I HAVE WANDERED ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN MY TIME AND IN ALL KINDS OF PLACES
1168-134958-0074 IF YOU LIKE HOWEVER I WILL GO WITH YOU TO MY BROTHER THE NORTH WIND HE IS THE OLDEST AND STRONGEST OF ALL OF US
1168-134958-0075 SO SHE SEATED HERSELF ON HIS BACK AND OFF HE WENT FROM HIS HOUSE IN GREAT HASTE AND THEY WERE NOT LONG ON THE WAY
1168-134958-0076 AND THEY FROZE AS THEY HEARD SAID THE SOUTH WIND IT IS I AND THIS IS SHE WHO SHOULD HAVE HAD THE PRINCE
1168-134958-0077 GLADLY FIND HIM AGAIN YES
1168-134958-0078 GET THERE I MUST SAID SHE
1168-134958-0079 FOR IF WE ARE EVER TO GET THERE WE MUST HAVE THE DAY BEFORE US THE NORTH WIND WOKE HER BETIMES NEXT MORNING AND PUFFED HIMSELF UP AND MADE HIMSELF SO
1168-134958-0080 AND AWAY THEY WENT HIGH UP THROUGH THE AIR AS IF THEY WOULD NOT STOP UNTIL THEY HAD REACHED THE VERY END OF THE WORLD
1168-134958-0081 WOODS AND HOUSES AND WHEN THEY WERE ABOVE THE SEA THE SHIPS WERE WRECKED BY HUNDREDS
1168-134958-0082 A LONG TIME WENT BY AND THEN YET MORE TIME PASSED AND STILL THEY WERE ABOVE THE SEA AND THE NORTH WIND GREW TIRED
1168-134958-0083 AND MORE TIRED AND AT LAST SO UTTERLY WEARY THAT HE WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO BLOW ANY LONGER
1168-134958-0084 LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL AT LAST HE WENT SO LOW
1168-134958-0085 SAID THE NORTH WIND I HAVE NO FEAR SAID SHE AND IT WAS TRUE BUT THEY WERE NOT VERY VERY FAR FROM LAND
1168-134958-0086 AND THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH STRENGTH LEFT IN THE NORTH WIND TO ENABLE HIM TO THROW HER ON TO THE SHORE IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE WINDOWS OF A CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
1168-134958-0087 NEXT MORNING SHE SAT DOWN BENEATH THE WALLS OF THE CASTLE TO PLAY WITH THE GOLDEN APPLE AND THE FIRST PERSON SHE SAW
1168-134958-0088 SAID SHE OPENING THE WINDOW IT CAN'T BE BOUGHT EITHER FOR GOLD OR MONEY ANSWERED THE GIRL
1168-134958-0089 WELL IF I MAY GO TO THE PRINCE WHO IS HERE AND BE WITH HIM TO NIGHT YOU SHALL HAVE IT
1168-134958-0090 SAID THE PRINCESS FOR SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND WHAT SHE WOULD DO
1168-134958-0091 FOR THE PRINCESS HAD SO CONTRIVED IT THE POOR GIRL CALLED TO HIM AND SHOOK HIM AND BETWEEN WHILES SHE WEPT BUT SHE COULD NOT WAKE HIM IN THE MORNING AS SOON AS DAY DAWNED
1168-134958-0092 AND DROVE HER OUT AGAIN IN THE DAYTIME SHE SAT DOWN ONCE MORE BENEATH THE WINDOWS OF THE CASTLE AND BEGAN TO CARD WITH HER GOLDEN CARDING COMB
1168-134958-0093 THE PRINCESS ASKED HER WHAT SHE WANTED FOR IT AND SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT FOR SALE EITHER FOR GOLD OR MONEY BUT THAT IF SHE COULD GET LEAVE TO GO TO THE PRINCE AND BE WITH HIM DURING THE NIGHT SHE SHOULD HAVE IT
1168-134958-0094 BUT WHEN SHE WENT UP TO THE PRINCE'S ROOM HE WAS AGAIN ASLEEP AND LET HER CALL HIM OR SHAKE HIM OR WEEP AS SHE WOULD HE STILL SLEPT ON AND SHE COULD NOT PUT ANY LIFE IN HIM
1168-134958-0095 AND ONCE MORE DROVE HER AWAY WHEN DAY HAD QUITE COME THE GIRL SEATED HERSELF UNDER THE CASTLE WINDOWS TO SPIN WITH HER GOLDEN SPINNING WHEEL
1168-134958-0096 AND ASKED WHAT SHE WOULD TAKE FOR IT THE GIRL SAID WHAT SHE HAD SAID ON EACH OF THE FORMER OCCASIONS THAT IT WAS NOT FOR SALE EITHER FOR GOLD OR FOR MONEY
1168-134958-0097 BUT IF SHE COULD GET LEAVE TO GO TO THE PRINCE WHO LIVED THERE AND BE WITH HIM DURING THE NIGHT
1168-134958-0098 BUT IN THAT PLACE THERE WERE SOME CHRISTIAN FOLK WHO HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AND THEY HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE CHAMBER WHICH WAS NEXT TO THAT OF THE PRINCE AND HAD HEARD HOW A WOMAN HAD BEEN IN THERE WHO HAD WEPT AND CALLED ON HIM TWO NIGHTS RUNNING
1168-134958-0099 SO THAT EVENING WHEN THE PRINCESS CAME ONCE MORE WITH HER SLEEPING DRINK
1168-134958-0100 AND SHE HAD TO TELL HIM HOW SHE HAD COME THERE YOU HAVE COME JUST IN TIME SAID THE PRINCE FOR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO MORROW BUT I WILL NOT HAVE THE LONG NOSED PRINCESS
1168-134958-0101 AND YOU ALONE CAN SAVE ME I WILL SAY THAT I WANT TO SEE WHAT MY BRIDE CAN DO AND BID HER WASH THE SHIRT
1168-134958-0102 FOR SHE DOES NOT KNOW THAT IT IS YOU WHO LET THEM FALL ON IT BUT NO ONE CAN WASH THEM OUT BUT ONE BORN OF CHRISTIAN FOLK IT CANNOT BE DONE BY ONE OF A PACK OF TROLLS
1168-134958-0103 AND THEN I WILL SAY THAT NO ONE SHALL EVER BE MY BRIDE BUT THE WOMAN WHO CAN DO THIS AND I KNOW THAT YOU
1168-134958-0104 THERE WAS GREAT JOY AND GLADNESS BETWEEN THEM ALL THAT NIGHT BUT THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE WEDDING WAS TO TAKE PLACE THE PRINCE SAID I MUST SEE WHAT MY BRIDE CAN DO
1168-134958-0105 THAT YOU MAY DO SAID THE STEPMOTHER I HAVE A FINE SHIRT WHICH I WANT TO WEAR AS MY WEDDING SHIRT BUT THREE DROPS OF TALLOW HAVE GOT UPON IT
1168-134958-0106 WHICH I WANT TO HAVE WASHED OFF AND I HAVE VOWED TO MARRY NO ONE BUT THE WOMAN WHO IS ABLE TO DO IT IF SHE CANNOT DO THAT SHE IS NOT WORTH HAVING
1168-134958-0107 WELL THAT WAS A VERY SMALL MATTER THEY THOUGHT AND AGREED TO DO IT
1168-134958-0108 BUT THE MORE SHE WASHED AND RUBBED THE LARGER THE SPOTS GREW
1168-134958-0109 BUT SHE TOO HAD NOT HAD THE SHIRT VERY LONG IN HER HANDS BEFORE IT LOOKED WORSE STILL AND THE MORE SHE WASHED IT AND RUBBED IT THE LARGER AND BLACKER GREW THE SPOTS
1168-134958-0110 SO THE OTHER TROLLS HAD TO COME AND WASH BUT THE MORE THEY DID THE BLACKER AND UGLIER GREW THE SHIRT UNTIL AT LENGTH IT WAS AS BLACK AS IF IT HAD BEEN UP THE CHIMNEY
1168-134958-0111 CRIED THE PRINCE NOT ONE OF YOU IS GOOD FOR ANYTHING AT ALL THERE IS A BEGGAR GIRL SITTING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND I'LL BE BOUND THAT SHE CAN WASH BETTER THAN ANY OF YOU COME IN YOU GIRL THERE HE CRIED
1168-134958-0112 SO SHE CAME IN CAN YOU WASH THIS SHIRT CLEAN HE CRIED OH I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID BUT I WILL TRY
1168-134958-0113 AND DIPPED IT IN THE WATER THAN IT WAS WHITE AS DRIVEN SNOW
1168-134958-0114 THAT SHE BURST
1168-134958-0115 AND ALL THE LITTLE TROLLS MUST HAVE BURST TOO FOR THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN HEARD OF SINCE THE PRINCE AND HIS BRIDE SET FREE ALL THE CHRISTIAN FOLK WHO WERE IMPRISONED THERE
1168-134958-0116 AND TOOK AWAY WITH THEM ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER THAT THEY COULD CARRY AND MOVED FAR AWAY FROM THE CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST
