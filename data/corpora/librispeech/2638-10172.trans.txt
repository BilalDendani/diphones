2638-10172-0000 THE POSTERN BY WHICH SKELDERGATE WAS FORMERLY APPROACHED NO LONGER EXISTS AND THE FEW OLD HOUSES LEFT IN THE STREET ARE DISGUISED IN MELANCHOLY MODERN COSTUME OF WHITEWASH AND CEMENT
2638-10172-0001 SHOPS OF THE SMALLER AND POORER ORDER INTERMIXED HERE AND THERE WITH DINGY WAREHOUSES AND JOYLESS PRIVATE RESIDENCES OF RED BRICK COMPOSE THE PRESENT A SPECT OF SKELDERGATE ON THE RIVER SIDE
2638-10172-0002 AND THE TOWING PATH ON THE OTHER OPEN TO VIEW HERE WHERE THE STREET ENDS AND ON THE SIDE OF IT FURTHEST FROM THE RIVER A NARROW LITTLE LANE LEADS UP TO THE PAVED FOOTWAY SURMOUNTING THE ANCIENT WALLS OF YORK THE ONE SMALL ROW OF BUILDINGS
2638-10172-0003 WHICH IS ALL THAT THE LANE POSSESSES IS COMPOSED OF CHEAP LODGING HOUSES WITH AN OPPOSITE VIEW AT THE DISTANCE OF A FEW FEET OF A PORTION OF THE MASSIVE CITY WALL THIS PLACE IS CALLED ROSEMARY LANE VERY LITTLE LIGHT ENTERS IT VERY FEW PEOPLE LIVE IN IT
2638-10172-0004 OPENED SOFTLY ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY THIRD OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX AND A SOLITARY INDIVIDUAL OF THE MALE SEX SAUNTERED INTO SKELDERGATE FROM THE SECLUSION OF ROSEMARY LANE TURNING NORTHWARD
2638-10172-0005 AND HE SURVEYED THE SCENE AROUND HIM WITH EYES OF TWO DIFFERENT COLORS A BILIOUS BROWN EYE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR EMPLOYMENT AND A BILIOUS GREEN EYE IN A SIMILAR PREDICAMENT IN PLAINER TERMS
2638-10172-0006 HAD WITHDRAWN HIM FROM HIS CUSTOMARY PURSUITS AND HAD LEFT HIM PROSTRATE IN THE END LIKE MANY A BETTER MAN HE HAD LOST HIS CLERICAL APPEARANCE HE HAD FADED WITH THE AUTUMN LEAVES HIS CRAPE HAT BAND HAD PUT ITSELF IN BROWN MOURNING FOR ITS OWN BEREAVEMENT OF BLACK
2638-10172-0007 SUPERIOR TO ALL FORMS OF MORAL MILDEW IMPERVIOUS TO THE ACTION OF SOCIAL RUST HE WAS AS COURTEOUS AS PERSUASIVE AS BLANDLY DIGNIFIED AS EVER HE CARRIED HIS HEAD AS HIGH WITHOUT A SHIRT COLLAR AS EVER HE HAD CARRIED IT WITH ONE
2638-10172-0008 THE THREADBARE BLACK HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS NECK WAS PERFECTLY TIED HIS ROTTEN OLD SHOES WERE NEATLY BLACKED
2638-10172-0009 TIME CHANGE AND POVERTY HAD ALL ATTACKED THE CAPTAIN TOGETHER AND HAD ALL FAILED ALIKE TO GET HIM DOWN ON THE GROUND HE PACED THE STREETS OF YORK A MAN SUPERIOR TO CLOTHES AND CIRCUMSTANCES HIS VAGABOND VARNISH AS BRIGHT ON HIM AS EVER
2638-10172-0010 IT WAS PLAINLY EVIDENT THAT HE HAD NO PARTICULAR DESTINATION TO REACH AND NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WHILE HE WAS STILL LOITERING THE CLOCK OF YORK MINSTER CHIMED THE HALF HOUR PAST FIVE CABS RATTLED BY HIM OVER THE BRIDGE ON THEIR WAY TO MEET THE TRAIN FROM LONDON
2638-10172-0011 AT TWENTY MINUTES TO SIX AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION THE CAPTAIN SAUNTERED AFTER THE CABS WHEN IT IS ONE OF A MAN'S REGULAR HABITS TO LIVE UPON HIS FELLOW CREATURES THAT MAN IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS FOND OF HAUNTING LARGE RAILWAY STATIONS
2638-10172-0012 THAT ENTIRE INCAPABILITY OF DEVISING ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF LARGE CROWDS WHICH IS ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ENGLISHMEN IN AUTHORITY
2638-10172-0013 THREE DIFFERENT LINES OF RAILWAY ASSEMBLE THREE PASSENGER MOBS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT UNDER ONE ROOF AND LEAVE THEM TO RAISE A TRAVELER'S RIOT WITH ALL THE ASSISTANCE WHICH THE BEWILDERED SERVANTS OF THE COMPANY CAN RENDER TO INCREASE THE CONFUSION
2638-10172-0014 THE CUSTOMARY DISTURBANCE WAS RISING TO ITS CLIMAX AS CAPTAIN WRAGGE APPROACHED THE PLATFORM DOZENS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO ATTAIN DOZENS OF DIFFERENT OBJECTS IN DOZENS OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ALL STARTING FROM THE SAME COMMON POINT
2638-10172-0015 AND ALL EQUALLY DEPRIVED OF THE MEANS OF INFORMATION A SUDDEN PARTING OF THE CROWD NEAR THE SECOND CLASS CARRIAGES ATTRACTED THE CAPTAIN'S CURIOSITY HE PUSHED HIS WAY IN AND FOUND A DECENTLY DRESSED MAN ASSISTED BY A PORTER AND A POLICEMAN
2638-10172-0016 ATTEMPTING TO PICK UP SOME PRINTED BILLS SCATTERED FROM A PAPER PARCEL WHICH HIS FRENZIED FELLOW PASSENGERS HAD KNOCKED OUT OF HIS HAND OFFERING HIS ASSISTANCE IN THIS EMERGENCY WITH THE POLITE ALACRITY WHICH MARKED HIS CHARACTER
2638-10172-0017 FIFTY POUNDS REWARD PRINTED IN CAPITAL LETTERS ON THE BILLS WHICH HE ASSISTED IN RECOVERING AND INSTANTLY SECRETED ONE OF THEM TO BE MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED AT THE FIRST CONVENIENT OPPORTUNITY
2638-10172-0018 AS HE CRUMPLED UP THE BILL IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND HIS PARTY COLORED EYES FIXED WITH HUNGRY INTEREST ON THE PROPRIETOR OF THE UNLUCKY PARCEL WHEN A MAN HAPPENS NOT TO BE POSSESSED OF FIFTY PENCE IN HIS OWN POCKET IF HIS HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT BOUNDS
2638-10172-0019 IF HIS MOUTH IS PROPERLY CONSTITUTED IT WATERS AT THE SIGHT OF ANOTHER MAN WHO CARRIES ABOUT WITH HIM A PRINTED OFFER OF FIFTY POUNDS STERLING ADDRESSED TO HIS FELLOW CREATURES THE UNFORTUNATE TRAVELER WRAPPED UP HIS PARCEL AS HE BEST MIGHT
2638-10172-0020 LEAVING THE STATION FOR THE RIVER SIDE WHICH WAS CLOSE AT HAND THE STRANGER ENTERED THE FERRYBOAT AT THE NORTH STREET POSTERN
2638-10172-0021 ENTERED THE BOAT ALSO AND EMPLOYED THE SHORT INTERVAL OF TRANSIT TO THE OPPOSITE BANK IN A PERUSAL OF THE HANDBILL
2638-10172-0022 WITH HIS BACK CAREFULLY TURNED ON THE TRAVELER
2638-10172-0023 A YOUNG LADY AGE EIGHTEEN DRESS DEEP MOURNING PERSONAL APPEARANCE HAIR OF A VERY LIGHT BROWN EYEBROWS AND EYELASHES DARKER EYES LIGHT GRAY COMPLEXION STRIKINGLY PALE
2638-10172-0024 TWO LITTLE MOLES CLOSE TOGETHER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE NECK MARK ON THE UNDER CLOTHING
2638-10172-0025 IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE JOINED OR ATTEMPTED TO JOIN UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME A THEATRICAL COMPANY NOW PERFORMING AT YORK HAD WHEN SHE LEFT LONDON ONE BLACK BOX AND NO OTHER LUGGAGE WHOEVER WILL GIVE SUCH INFORMATION AS WILL RESTORE HER TO HER FRIENDS
2638-10172-0026 SHALL RECEIVE THE ABOVE REWARD APPLY AT THE OFFICE OF MISTER HARKNESS SOLICITOR CONEY STREET YORK OR TO MESSRS WYATT PENDRIL AND GWILT SERLE STREET LINCOLN'S INN LONDON
2638-10172-0027 POCKETED THE HANDBILL AND FOLLOWED HIS LEADER FOR THE SECOND TIME THE STRANGER DIRECTED HIS STEPS TO THE NEAREST STREET WHICH RAN DOWN TO THE RIVER COMPARED A NOTE IN HIS POCKETBOOK WITH THE NUMBERS OF THE HOUSES ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE STOPPED AT ONE OF THEM AND RANG THE BELL
2638-10172-0028 THE CAPTAIN WENT ON TO THE NEXT HOUSE AFFECTED TO RING THE BELL IN HIS TURN AND STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO THE TRAVELER IN APPEARANCE WAITING TO BE LET IN IN REALITY
2638-10172-0029 LISTENING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FOR ANY SCRAPS OF DIALOGUE WHICH MIGHT REACH HIS EARS ON THE OPENING OF THE DOOR BEHIND HIM THE DOOR WAS ANSWERED WITH ALL DUE ALACRITY
2638-10172-0030 DOES MISTER HUXTABLE LIVE HERE ASKED THE TRAVELER YES SIR WAS THE ANSWER IN A WOMAN'S VOICE IS HE AT HOME NOT AT HOME NOW SIR BUT HE WILL BE IN AGAIN AT EIGHT TO NIGHT I THINK A YOUNG LADY CALLED HERE EARLY IN THE DAY DID SHE NOT
2638-10172-0031 JUST SO I WILL CALL AND SEE MISTER HUXTABLE AT THE SAME TIME ANY NAME SIR NO SAY A GENTLEMAN CALLED ON THEATRICAL BUSINESS THAT WILL BE ENOUGH WAIT ONE MINUTE IF YOU PLEASE I AM A STRANGER IN YORK WILL YOU KINDLY TELL ME WHICH IS THE WAY TO CONEY STREET
2638-10172-0032 THE WOMAN GAVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION THE DOOR CLOSED AND THE STRANGER HASTENED AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF CONEY STREET
2638-10172-0033 THE HANDBILL REVEALED PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT THE MAN'S NEXT OBJECT WAS TO COMPLETE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE LOCAL SOLICITOR ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PROMISED REWARD HAVING SEEN AND HEARD ENOUGH FOR HIS IMMEDIATE PURPOSE THE CAPTAIN RETRACED HIS STEPS DOWN THE STREET TURNED TO THE RIGHT
2638-10172-0034 AND ENTERED ON THE ESPLANADE WHICH IN THAT QUARTER OF THE CITY BORDERS THE RIVER SIDE BETWEEN THE SWIMMING BATHS AND LENDAL TOWER THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER
2638-10172-0035 PERSISTING FROM SHEER FORCE OF HABIT IN THE OLD ASSERTION OF HIS RELATIONSHIP TO MAGDALEN'S MOTHER
2638-10172-0036 AND SO HE SAW IT NOW THREE COURSES WERE OPEN TO HIM IN CONNECTION WITH THE REMARKABLE DISCOVERY WHICH HE HAD JUST MADE THE FIRST COURSE WAS TO DO NOTHING IN THE MATTER AT ALL INADMISSIBLE ON FAMILY GROUNDS EQUALLY INADMISSIBLE ON PECUNIARY GROUNDS
2638-10172-0037 REJECTED ACCORDINGLY THE SECOND COURSE WAS TO DESERVE THE GRATITUDE OF THE YOUNG LADY'S FRIENDS RATED AT FIFTY POUNDS THE THIRD COURSE WAS BY A TIMELY WARNING TO DESERVE THE GRATITUDE OF THE YOUNG LADY HERSELF RATED AT AN UNKNOWN FIGURE
2638-10172-0038 NOT FROM DOUBT OF MAGDALEN'S PECUNIARY RESOURCES FOR HE WAS TOTALLY IGNORANT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAD DEPRIVED THE SISTERS OF THEIR INHERITANCE BUT FROM DOUBT WHETHER AN OBSTACLE IN THE SHAPE OF AN UNDISCOVERED GENTLEMAN MIGHT NOT BE PRIVATELY CONNECTED WITH HER DISAPPEARANCE FROM HOME
2638-10172-0039 I FEEL FOR THIS MISGUIDED GIRL MUSED THE CAPTAIN SOLEMNLY STRUTTING BACKWARD AND FORWARD BY THE LONELY RIVER SIDE
2638-10172-0040 I ALWAYS SHALL LOOK UPON HER
2638-10172-0041 WHERE WAS THE ADOPTED RELATIVE AT THAT MOMENT IN OTHER WORDS HOW WAS A YOUNG LADY IN MAGDALEN'S CRITICAL POSITION
2638-10172-0042 IF THERE WAS AN OBSTRUCTIVE GENTLEMAN IN THE BACKGROUND IT WOULD BE MERE WASTE OF TIME TO PURSUE THE QUESTION BUT IF THE INFERENCE WHICH THE HANDBILL SUGGESTED WAS CORRECT IF SHE WAS REALLY ALONE AT THAT MOMENT IN THE CITY OF YORK WHERE WAS SHE LIKELY TO BE
2638-10172-0043 NOT IN THE CROWDED THOROUGHFARES TO BEGIN WITH NOT VIEWING THE OBJECTS OF INTEREST IN THE MINSTER
2638-10172-0044 WAS SHE IN THE WAITING ROOM AT THE RAILWAY SHE WOULD HARDLY RUN THAT RISK WAS SHE IN ONE OF THE HOTELS DOUBTFUL CONSIDERING THAT SHE WAS ENTIRELY BY HERSELF IN A PASTRY COOK'S SHOP FAR MORE LIKELY
2638-10172-0045 DRIVING ABOUT IN A CAB POSSIBLE CERTAINLY BUT NO MORE LOITERING AWAY THE TIME IN SOME QUIET LOCALITY OUT OF DOORS LIKELY ENOUGH AGAIN ON THAT FINE AUTUMN EVENING
2638-10172-0046 THE CAPTAIN PAUSED WEIGHED THE RELATIVE CLAIMS ON HIS ATTENTION OF THE QUIET LOCALITY AND THE PASTRY COOK'S SHOP
2638-10172-0047 THE SUN HAD SET MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR SINCE THE RED LIGHT LAY BROAD AND LOW IN THE CLOUDLESS WESTERN HEAVEN ALL VISIBLE OBJECTS WERE SOFTENING IN THE TENDER TWILIGHT BUT WERE NOT DARKENING YET THE FIRST FEW LAMPS LIT IN THE STREET BELOW
2638-10172-0048 ON HIS LEFT HAND THE MAJESTIC WEST FRONT OF YORK MINSTER SOARED OVER THE CITY AND CAUGHT THE LAST BRIGHTEST LIGHT OF HEAVEN ON THE SUMMITS OF ITS LOFTY TOWERS HAD THIS NOBLE PROSPECT TEMPTED THE LOST GIRL TO LINGER AND LOOK AT IT NO
2638-10172-0049 THUS FAR NOT A SIGN OF HER THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ROUND HIM ATTENTIVELY AND WALKED ON HE REACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE IRON COURSE OF THE RAILROAD STRIKES ITS WAY THROUGH ARCHES IN THE OLD WALL HE PAUSED AT THIS PLACE
2638-10172-0050 WHERE THE CENTRAL ACTIVITY OF A GREAT RAILWAY ENTERPRISE BEATS WITH ALL THE PULSES OF ITS LOUD CLANGING LIFE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE DEAD MAJESTY OF THE PAST DEEP UNDER THE OLD HISTORIC STONES WHICH TELL OF FORTIFIED YORK AND THE SIEGES OF TWO CENTURIES SINCE
2638-10172-0051 HE STOOD ON THIS SPOT AND SEARCHED FOR HER AGAIN AND SEARCHED IN VAIN OTHERS WERE LOOKING IDLY DOWN AT THE DESOLATE ACTIVITY ON THE WILDERNESS OF THE IRON RAILS BUT SHE WAS NOT AMONG THEM THE CAPTAIN GLANCED DOUBTFULLY AT THE DARKENING SKY
2638-10172-0052 ASCENDS AGAIN AND CONTINUES ITS COURSE SOUTHWARD UNTIL THE WALLS REACH THE RIVER ONCE MORE HE PAUSED AND PEERED ANXIOUSLY INTO THE DIM INNER CORNERS OF THE OLD GUARD ROOM WAS SHE WAITING THERE FOR THE DARKNESS TO COME AND HIDE HER FROM PRYING EYES
2638-10172-0053 NO A SOLITARY WORKMAN LOITERED THROUGH THE STONE CHAMBER BUT NO OTHER LIVING CREATURE STIRRED IN THE PLACE THE CAPTAIN MOUNTED THE STEPS WHICH LED OUT FROM THE POSTERN AND WALKED ON HE ADVANCED SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY YARDS ALONG THE PAVED FOOTWAY
2638-10172-0054 THE OUTLYING SUBURBS OF YORK ON ONE SIDE OF HIM A ROPE WALK AND SOME PATCHES OF KITCHEN GARDEN OCCUPYING A VACANT STRIP OF GROUND ON THE OTHER HE ADVANCED WITH EAGER EYES AND QUICKENED STEP FOR HE SAW BEFORE HIM THE LONELY FIGURE OF A WOMAN
2638-10172-0055 STANDING BY THE PARAPET OF THE WALL WITH HER FACE SET TOWARD THE WESTWARD VIEW HE APPROACHED CAUTIOUSLY TO MAKE SURE OF HER BEFORE SHE TURNED AND OBSERVED HIM THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THAT TALL DARK FIGURE AS IT RESTED AGAINST THE PARAPET WITH A LISTLESS GRACE
2638-10172-0056 THERE SHE STOOD IN HER LONG BLACK CLOAK AND GOWN THE LAST DIM LIGHT OF EVENING FALLING TENDERLY ON HER PALE RESOLUTE YOUNG FACE THERE SHE STOOD NOT THREE MONTHS SINCE
2638-10172-0057 THE SPOILED DARLING OF HER PARENTS THE PRICELESS TREASURE OF THE HOUSEHOLD NEVER LEFT UNPROTECTED NEVER TRUSTED ALONE THERE SHE STOOD IN THE LOVELY DAWN OF HER WOMANHOOD A CASTAWAY IN A STRANGE CITY WRECKED ON THE WORLD
2638-10172-0058 I THINK I HAVE THE HONOR OF ADDRESSING THE YOUNGER MISS VANSTONE HE BEGAN
2638-10172-0059 AND HIS ALTERED DRESS YOU ARE MISTAKEN SHE SAID QUIETLY YOU ARE A PERFECT STRANGER TO ME PARDON ME REPLIED THE CAPTAIN I AM A SPECIES OF RELATION
2638-10172-0060 I PRESENTED MYSELF ON THAT MEMORABLE OCCASION TO AN HONORED PRECEPTRESS IN YOUR LATE FATHER'S FAMILY PERMIT ME UNDER EQUALLY AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES TO PRESENT MYSELF TO YOU
2638-10172-0061 HE TUCKED HIS UMBRELLA UNDER HIS ARM AND JOCOSELY SPELLED HIS NAME FOR HER FURTHER ENLIGHTENMENT
2638-10172-0062 SAID THE CAPTAIN TICKING OFF THE LETTERS PERSUASIVELY ON HIS FINGERS I REMEMBER YOUR NAME SAID MAGDALEN EXCUSE ME FOR LEAVING YOU ABRUPTLY I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT SHE TRIED TO PASS HIM AND WALK ON NORTHWARD TOWARD THE RAILWAY
2638-10172-0063 HE INSTANTLY MET THE ATTEMPT BY RAISING BOTH HANDS AND DISPLAYING A PAIR OF DARNED BLACK GLOVES OUTSPREAD IN POLITE PROTEST NOT THAT WAY HE SAID NOT THAT WAY MISS VANSTONE I BEG AND ENTREAT
2638-10172-0064 WHY NOT SHE ASKED HAUGHTILY BECAUSE ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN THAT IS THE WAY WHICH LEADS TO MISTER HUXTABLE'S IN THE UNGOVERNABLE ASTONISHMENT OF HEARING HIS REPLY SHE SUDDENLY BENT FORWARD
2638-10172-0065 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME LOOKED HIM CLOSE IN THE FACE HE SUSTAINED HER SUSPICIOUS SCRUTINY WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF FEELING HIGHLY GRATIFIED BY IT H U X HUX SAID THE CAPTAIN PLAYFULLY TURNING TO THE OLD JOKE
2638-10172-0066 T A TA HUXTA B L E BLE HUXTABLE WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MISTER HUXTABLE SHE ASKED WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY MENTIONING HIM TO ME
2638-10172-0067 THE CAPTAIN'S CURLY LIP TOOK A NEW TWIST UPWARD HE IMMEDIATELY REPLIED TO THE BEST PRACTICAL PURPOSE BY PRODUCING THE HANDBILL FROM HIS POCKET THERE IS JUST LIGHT ENOUGH LEFT HE SAID
2638-10172-0068 FOR YOUNG AND LOVELY EYES TO READ BY BEFORE I ENTER UPON THE PERSONAL STATEMENT WHICH YOUR FLATTERING INQUIRY CLAIMS FROM ME PRAY BESTOW A MOMENT'S ATTENTION ON THIS DOCUMENT
2638-10172-0069 SHE TOOK THE HANDBILL FROM HIM BY THE LAST GLEAM OF TWILIGHT SHE READ THE LINES WHICH SET A PRICE ON HER RECOVERY WHICH PUBLISHED THE DESCRIPTION OF HER IN PITILESS PRINT LIKE THE DESCRIPTION OF A STRAYED DOG
2638-10172-0070 NO TENDER CONSIDERATION HAD PREPARED HER FOR THE SHOCK NO KIND WORD SOFTENED IT TO HER WHEN IT CAME THE VAGABOND WHOSE CUNNING EYES WATCHED HER EAGERLY WHILE SHE READ
2638-10172-0071 KNEW NO MORE THAT THE HANDBILL WHICH HE HAD STOLEN HAD ONLY BEEN PREPARED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE WORST AND WAS ONLY TO BE PUBLICLY USED IN THE EVENT OF ALL MORE CONSIDERATE MEANS OF TRACING HER BEING TRIED IN VAIN THAN SHE KNEW IT THE BILL DROPPED FROM HER HAND
2638-10172-0072 HER FACE FLUSHED DEEPLY SHE TURNED AWAY FROM CAPTAIN WRAGGE AS IF ALL IDEA OF HIS EXISTENCE HAD PASSED OUT OF HER MIND OH NORAH NORAH
2638-10172-0073 OH NORAH NORAH HOW IS NORAH INQUIRED THE CAPTAIN WITH THE UTMOST POLITENESS
2638-10172-0074 PRAY COMPOSE YOURSELF
2638-10172-0075 AT PRESENT I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE JUST PERUSED THE ONLY COPY IN CIRCULATION ALLOW ME TO PICK IT UP BEFORE HE COULD TOUCH THE BILL SHE SNATCHED IT FROM THE PAVEMENT TORE IT INTO FRAGMENTS AND THREW THEM OVER THE WALL
2638-10172-0076 HOW DID YOU COME BY IT SHE ASKED SUDDENLY MY DEAR CREATURE I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU REMONSTRATED THE CAPTAIN WE ALL COME BY IT FROM MY MATERNAL GRANDFATHER HOW DID YOU COME BY THAT HANDBILL
2638-10172-0077 PERMITTED HIMSELF TO TELL THE UNMITIGATED TRUTH THE EFFECT OF THE NARRATIVE ON MAGDALEN BY NO MEANS FULFILLED CAPTAIN WRAGGE'S ANTICIPATIONS IN RELATING IT SHE WAS NOT STARTLED SHE WAS NOT IRRITATED
2638-10172-0078 SHE SHOWED NO DISPOSITION TO CAST HERSELF ON HIS MERCY AND TO SEEK HIS ADVICE SHE LOOKED HIM STEADILY IN THE FACE AND ALL SHE SAID WHEN HE HAD NEATLY ROUNDED HIS LAST SENTENCE WAS GO ON GO ON REPEATED THE CAPTAIN
2638-10172-0079 SHOCKED TO DISAPPOINT YOU I AM SURE BUT THE FACT IS I HAVE DONE NO YOU HAVE NOT
2638-10172-0080 THE END OF IT IS YOU CAME HERE TO LOOK FOR ME AND YOU MEAN TO EARN THE FIFTY POUNDS REWARD
2638-10172-0081 SMART SAID THE CAPTAIN LAUGHING INDULGENTLY AND DRUMMING WITH HIS UMBRELLA ON THE PAVEMENT SOME MEN MIGHT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY I'M NOT EASILY OFFENDED TRY AGAIN
2638-10172-0082 MAGDALEN LOOKED AT HIM THROUGH THE GATHERING DARKNESS IN MUTE PERPLEXITY ALL HER LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF SOCIETY HAD BEEN EXPERIENCE AMONG PEOPLE WHO POSSESSED A COMMON SENSE OF HONOR AND A COMMON RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIAL POSITION
2638-10172-0083 SHE HAD HITHERTO SEEN NOTHING BUT THE SUCCESSFUL HUMAN PRODUCT FROM THE GREAT MANUFACTORY OF CIVILIZATION HERE WAS ONE OF THE FAILURES AND WITH ALL HER QUICKNESS SHE WAS PUZZLED HOW TO DEAL WITH IT
2638-10172-0084 PURSUED THE CAPTAIN IT HAS JUST OCCURRED TO MY MIND THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE SPOKEN IN EARNEST MY POOR CHILD HOW CAN I EARN THE FIFTY POUNDS BEFORE THE REWARD IS OFFERED TO ME
2638-10172-0085 THOSE HANDBILLS MAY NOT BE PUBLICLY POSTED FOR A WEEK TO COME PRECIOUS AS YOU ARE TO ALL YOUR RELATIVES MYSELF INCLUDED
2638-10172-0086 THERE IS A TRAIN TO LONDON AT NINE FORTY FIVE TO NIGHT
2638-10172-0087 AND GO BACK BY IT NEVER SAID MAGDALEN FIRING AT THE BARE SUGGESTION EXACTLY AS THE CAPTAIN HAD INTENDED SHE SHOULD IF MY MIND HAD NOT BEEN MADE UP BEFORE THAT VILE HANDBILL WOULD HAVE DECIDED ME I FORGIVE NORAH
2638-10172-0088 SHE ADDED TURNING AWAY AND SPEAKING TO HERSELF BUT NOT MISTER PENDRIL AND NOT MISS GARTH QUITE RIGHT
2638-10172-0089 THE FAMILY SPIRIT I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME MYSELF AT YOUR AGE
2638-10172-0090 HARK THERE GOES THE CLOCK AGAIN HALF PAST SEVEN MISS VANSTONE
2638-10172-0091 PARDON THIS SEASONABLE ABRUPTNESS IF YOU ARE TO CARRY OUT YOUR RESOLUTION IF YOU ARE TO BE YOUR OWN MISTRESS MUCH LONGER YOU MUST TAKE A COURSE OF SOME KIND BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK YOU ARE YOUNG
2638-10172-0092 YOU ARE INEXPERIENCED YOU ARE IN IMMINENT DANGER HERE IS A POSITION OF EMERGENCY ON ONE SIDE AND HERE AM I ON THE OTHER WITH AN UNCLE'S INTEREST IN YOU FULL OF ADVICE
2638-10172-0093 TAP ME SUPPOSE I CHOOSE TO DEPEND ON NOBODY AND TO ACT FOR MYSELF SAID MAGDALEN WHAT THEN THEN REPLIED THE CAPTAIN YOU WILL WALK STRAIGHT INTO ONE OF THE FOUR TRAPS
2638-10172-0094 WHICH ARE SET TO CATCH YOU IN THE ANCIENT AND INTERESTING CITY OF YORK TRAP THE FIRST AT MISTER HUXTABLE'S HOUSE TRAP THE SECOND AT ALL THE HOTELS
2638-10172-0095 AT THE RAILWAY STATION TRAP THE FOURTH AT THE THEATER THAT MAN WITH THE HANDBILLS HAS HAD AN HOUR AT HIS DISPOSAL IF HE HAS NOT SET THOSE FOUR TRAPS
2638-10172-0096 WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE LOCAL SOLICITOR BY THIS TIME HE IS NOT THE COMPETENT LAWYER'S CLERK I TAKE HIM FOR
2638-10172-0097 IF THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE BACKGROUND WHOSE ADVICE YOU PREFER TO MINE YOU SEE THAT I AM ALONE SHE INTERPOSED PROUDLY IF YOU KNEW ME BETTER YOU WOULD KNOW THAT I DEPEND ON NOBODY BUT MYSELF
2638-10172-0098 THOSE WORDS DECIDED THE ONLY DOUBT WHICH NOW REMAINED IN THE CAPTAIN'S MIND THE DOUBT WHETHER THE COURSE WAS CLEAR BEFORE HIM THE MOTIVE OF HER FLIGHT FROM HOME WAS EVIDENTLY WHAT THE HANDBILLS ASSUMED IT TO BE A RECKLESS FANCY FOR GOING ON THE STAGE
2638-10172-0099 ONE OF TWO THINGS THOUGHT WRAGGE TO HIMSELF IN HIS LOGICAL WAY SHE'S WORTH MORE THAN FIFTY POUNDS TO ME IN HER PRESENT SITUATION OR SHE ISN'T IF SHE IS HER FRIENDS MAY WHISTLE FOR HER
2638-10172-0100 IF SHE ISN'T I HAVE ONLY TO KEEP HER TILL THE BILLS ARE POSTED FORTIFIED BY THIS SIMPLE PLAN OF ACTION THE CAPTAIN RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AND POLITELY PLACED MAGDALEN BETWEEN THE TWO INEVITABLE ALTERNATIVES
2638-10172-0101 OF TRUSTING HERSELF TO HIM ON THE ONE HAND OR OF RETURNING TO HER FRIENDS ON THE OTHER I RESPECT INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER WHEREVER I FIND IT HE SAID WITH AN AIR OF VIRTUOUS SEVERITY
2638-10172-0102 UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IS YOUR WAY MISTER HUXTABLE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO BEGIN WITH OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR TO NIGHT SAID MAGDALEN
2638-10172-0103 EXCELLENT HOTELS FOR SINGLE GENTLEMEN THE VERY WORST HOTELS IN THE WORLD FOR HANDSOME YOUNG LADIES WHO PRESENT THEMSELVES ALONE AT THE DOOR WITHOUT MALE ESCORT WITHOUT A MAID IN ATTENDANCE
2638-10172-0104 AND WITHOUT A SINGLE ARTICLE OF LUGGAGE DARK AS IT IS I THINK I COULD SEE A LADY'S BOX IF THERE WAS ANYTHING OF THE SORT IN OUR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD
2638-10172-0105 WHAT IS TO PREVENT MY SENDING THE TICKET FOR IT NOTHING IF YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE YOUR ADDRESS BY MEANS OF YOUR BOX NOTHING WHATEVER THINK PRAY THINK
2638-10172-0106 AS NOT TO INQUIRE AT ALL THE HOTELS
2638-10172-0107 OF YOUR STRIKING APPEARANCE EVEN IF THEY CONSENTED TO RECEIVE YOU
2638-10172-0108 OF UNIVERSAL CURIOSITY AND REMARK HERE IS NIGHT COMING ON AS FAST AS IT CAN DON'T LET ME BORE YOU ONLY LET ME ASK ONCE MORE WHERE ARE YOU TO SLEEP
2638-10172-0109 THERE WAS NO ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IN MAGDALEN'S POSITION THERE WAS LITERALLY NO ANSWER TO IT ON HER SIDE SHE WAS SILENT
2638-10172-0110 REPEATED THE CAPTAIN THE REPLY IS OBVIOUS UNDER MY ROOF
2638-10172-0111 LOOK UPON HER AS YOUR AUNT PRAY LOOK UPON HER AS YOUR AUNT THE LANDLADY IS A WIDOW THE HOUSE IS CLOSE BY THERE ARE NO OTHER LODGERS AND THERE IS A BEDROOM TO LET
2638-10172-0112 CAN ANYTHING BE MORE SATISFACTORY UNDER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
2638-10172-0113 AND CONFINE MYSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO THE NIGHT I MAY OR MAY NOT COMMAND THEATRICAL FACILITIES WHICH I AM IN A POSITION TO OFFER YOU
2638-10172-0114 SYMPATHY AND ADMIRATION MAY OR MAY NOT BE STRONG WITHIN ME WHEN I CONTEMPLATE THE DASH AND INDEPENDENCE OF YOUR CHARACTER HOSTS OF EXAMPLES OF BRIGHT STARS OF THE BRITISH DRAMA
2638-10172-0115 WE ARE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES WALK OF MY PRESENT ADDRESS ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU MY ARM NO YOU HESITATE YOU DISTRUST ME
2638-10172-0116 GOOD HEAVENS IS IT POSSIBLE YOU CAN HAVE HEARD ANYTHING TO MY DISADVANTAGE QUITE POSSIBLE SAID MAGDALEN WITHOUT A MOMENT'S FLINCHING FROM THE ANSWER MAY I INQUIRE THE PARTICULARS ASKED THE CAPTAIN WITH THE POLITEST COMPOSURE
2638-10172-0117 WHAT IS MISTER HUXTABLE
2638-10172-0118 VERY GOOD NOW OBSERVE
2638-10172-0119 TO GO ON THE STAGE MY DEAR GIRL
2638-10172-0120 IT'S NOT A RESPECTABLE MAN YOU WANT IN YOUR PRESENT PREDICAMENT IT'S A ROGUE LIKE ME MAGDALEN LAUGHED BITTERLY THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN THAT SHE SAID
2638-10172-0121 THANK YOU FOR RECALLING ME TO MYSELF AND MY CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE MY END TO GAIN
2638-10172-0122 IS MY TURN TO BEG PARDON NOW I HAVE BEEN TALKING AS IF I WAS A YOUNG LADY OF FAMILY AND POSITION ABSURD WE KNOW BETTER THAN THAT DON'T WE CAPTAIN WRAGGE YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT NOBODY'S CHILD MUST SLEEP UNDER SOMEBODY'S ROOF AND WHY NOT YOURS
2638-10172-0123 SAID THE CAPTAIN DEXTEROUSLY PROFITING BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER HUMOR AND CUNNINGLY REFRAINING FROM EXASPERATING IT BY SAYING MORE HIMSELF THIS WAY SHE FOLLOWED HIM A FEW STEPS AND SUDDENLY STOPPED SUPPOSE I AM DISCOVERED
2638-10172-0124 SHE BROKE OUT ABRUPTLY WHO HAS ANY AUTHORITY OVER ME WHO CAN TAKE ME BACK IF I DON'T CHOOSE TO GO IF THEY ALL FIND ME TO MORROW WHAT THEN CAN'T I SAY NO TO MISTER PENDRIL CAN'T I TRUST MY OWN COURAGE WITH MISS GARTH
2638-10172-0125 SHE ROUSED HERSELF LOOKED UP AT THE DARKENING HEAVEN LOOKED ROUND AT THE DARKENING VIEW WHAT MUST BE MUST SHE SAID AND FOLLOWED HIM THE MINSTER CLOCK STRUCK THE QUARTER TO EIGHT AS THEY LEFT THE WALK ON THE WALL
