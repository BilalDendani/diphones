249-121331-0000 CHAPTER FOUR NARCISSUS OFF DUTY DURING PRINCETON'S TRANSITION PERIOD THAT IS DURING AMORY'S LAST TWO YEARS THERE WHILE HE SAW IT CHANGE AND BROADEN AND LIVE UP TO ITS GOTHIC BEAUTY BY BETTER MEANS THAN NIGHT PARADES
249-121331-0001 SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN FRESHMEN AND WILD FRESHMEN WITH AMORY SOME WERE IN THE CLASS BELOW
249-121331-0002 AND AROUND SMALL TABLES AT THE NASSAU INN
249-121331-0003 FIRST AND PARTLY BY ACCIDENT THEY STRUCK ON CERTAIN BOOKS A DEFINITE TYPE OF BIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL THAT AMORY CHRISTENED QUEST BOOKS IN THE QUEST BOOK
249-121331-0004 THE HERO SET OFF IN LIFE ARMED WITH THE BEST WEAPONS AND AVOWEDLY INTENDING TO USE THEM AS SUCH WEAPONS ARE USUALLY USED TO PUSH THEIR POSSESSORS AHEAD AS SELFISHLY AND BLINDLY AS POSSIBLE BUT THE HEROES OF THE QUEST BOOKS DISCOVERED
249-121331-0005 NONE OTHER GODS SINISTER STREET AND THE RESEARCH MAGNIFICENT WERE EXAMPLES OF SUCH BOOKS IT WAS THE LATTER OF THESE THREE THAT GRIPPED BURNE HOLIDAY AND MADE HIM WONDER IN THE BEGINNING OF SENIOR YEAR
249-121331-0006 HOW MUCH IT WAS WORTH WHILE BEING A DIPLOMATIC AUTOCRAT AROUND HIS CLUB ON PROSPECT AVENUE AND BASKING IN THE HIGH LIGHTS OF CLASS OFFICE IT WAS DISTINCTLY THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF ARISTOCRACY THAT BURNE FOUND HIS WAY AMORY THROUGH KERRY
249-121331-0007 HAD HAD A VAGUE DRIFTING ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM
249-121331-0008 DID THEIR FRIENDSHIP COMMENCE HEARD THE LATEST SAID TOM
249-121331-0009 NO SOMEBODY FLUNKED OUT OR ANOTHER SHIP SUNK WORSE THAN THAT
249-121331-0010 WHAT ACTUAL FACT WHY SPIRIT OF REFORM AND ALL THAT BURNE HOLIDAY IS BEHIND IT THE CLUB PRESIDENTS ARE HOLDING A MEETING TO NIGHT TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND A JOINT MEANS OF COMBATING IT WELL WHAT'S THE IDEA OF THE THING
249-121331-0011 OH CLUBS INJURIOUS TO PRINCETON DEMOCRACY COST A LOT DRAW SOCIAL LINES TAKE TIME THE REGULAR LINE YOU GET SOMETIMES FROM DISAPPOINTED SOPHOMORES
249-121331-0012 BUT THIS IS THE REAL THING ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'LL GO THROUGH FOR PETE'S SAKE TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT WELL BEGAN TOM
249-121331-0013 AND THE POINT OF ABOLISHING THE CLUBS WAS BROUGHT UP BY SOME ONE EVERYBODY THERE LEAPED AT IT IT HAD BEEN IN EACH ONE'S MIND MORE OR LESS AND IT JUST NEEDED A SPARK TO BRING IT OUT FINE I SWEAR I THINK IT'LL BE MOST ENTERTAINING
249-121331-0014 WILD OF COURSE EVERY ONE'S BEEN SITTING AND ARGUING AND SWEARING AND GETTING MAD AND GETTING SENTIMENTAL AND GETTING BRUTAL IT'S THE SAME AT ALL THE CLUBS I'VE BEEN THE ROUNDS THEY GET ONE OF THE RADICALS IN THE CORNER AND FIRE QUESTIONS AT HIM
249-121331-0015 OH MODERATELY WELL BURNE'S A DAMN GOOD TALKER AND SO OBVIOUSLY SINCERE THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE WITH HIM IT'S SO EVIDENT THAT RESIGNING FROM HIS CLUB MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO HIM THAN PREVENTING IT DOES TO US THAT I FELT FUTILE WHEN I ARGUED
249-121331-0016 FINALLY TOOK A POSITION THAT WAS BRILLIANTLY NEUTRAL IN FACT
249-121331-0017 CALL IT A FOURTH AND BE SAFE LORD WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE
249-121331-0018 HELLO AMORY HELLO TOM AMORY ROSE EVENING BURNE DON'T MIND IF I SEEM TO RUSH I'M GOING TO RENWICK'S BURNE TURNED TO HIM QUICKLY
249-121331-0019 AND IT ISN'T A BIT PRIVATE I WISH YOU'D STAY I'D BE GLAD TO
249-121331-0020 BROAD BROWED AND STRONG CHINNED WITH A FINENESS IN THE HONEST GRAY EYES THAT WERE LIKE KERRY'S BURNE WAS A MAN WHO GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPRESSION OF BIGNESS AND SECURITY STUBBORN THAT WAS EVIDENT
249-121331-0021 AND WHEN HE HAD TALKED FOR FIVE MINUTES AMORY KNEW THAT THIS KEEN ENTHUSIASM HAD IN IT NO QUALITY OF DILETTANTISM THE INTENSE POWER AMORY FELT LATER IN BURNE HOLIDAY DIFFERED FROM THE ADMIRATION HE HAD HAD FOR HUMBIRD
249-121331-0022 THIS TIME IT BEGAN AS PURELY A MENTAL INTEREST
249-121331-0023 BUT THAT NIGHT AMORY WAS STRUCK BY BURNE'S INTENSE EARNESTNESS A QUALITY HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ASSOCIATE ONLY WITH THE DREAD STUPIDITY AND BY THE GREAT ENTHUSIASM THAT STRUCK DEAD CHORDS IN HIS HEART
249-121331-0024 NEVER DID THEY SEEM TO HAVE NEW EXPERIENCES IN COMMON FOR TOM AND ALEC HAD BEEN AS BLINDLY BUSY WITH THEIR COMMITTEES AND BOARDS AS AMORY HAD BEEN BLINDLY IDLING
249-121331-0025 THEY HAD HASHED AND REHASHED FOR MANY A FRUGAL CONVERSATIONAL MEAL THAT NIGHT THEY DISCUSSED THE CLUBS UNTIL TWELVE AND IN THE MAIN THEY AGREED WITH BURNE
249-121331-0026 DOVETAILED SO COMPLETELY WITH EVERYTHING THEY HAD THOUGHT THAT THEY QUESTIONED RATHER THAN ARGUED AND ENVIED THE SANITY THAT ENABLED THIS MAN TO STAND OUT SO AGAINST ALL TRADITIONS THEN AMORY BRANCHED OFF AND FOUND THAT BURNE WAS DEEP IN OTHER THINGS AS WELL
249-121331-0027 HOW ABOUT RELIGION AMORY ASKED HIM DON'T KNOW I'M IN A MUDDLE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS I'VE JUST DISCOVERED THAT I'VE A MIND AND I'M STARTING TO READ READ WHAT EVERYTHING I HAVE TO PICK AND CHOOSE OF COURSE BUT MOSTLY THINGS TO MAKE ME THINK
249-121331-0028 I'M READING THE FOUR GOSPELS NOW AND THE VARIETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE WHAT CHIEFLY STARTED YOU WELLS I GUESS AND TOLSTOI AND A MAN NAMED EDWARD CARPENTER I'VE BEEN READING FOR OVER A YEAR NOW
249-121331-0029 ON A FEW LINES ON WHAT I CONSIDER THE ESSENTIAL LINES POETRY WELL FRANKLY NOT WHAT YOU CALL POETRY OR FOR YOUR REASONS YOU TWO WRITE OF COURSE AND LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHITMAN IS THE MAN THAT ATTRACTS ME WHITMAN
249-121331-0030 HOW ABOUT YOU TOM TOM NODDED SHEEPISHLY WELL CONTINUED BURNE
249-121331-0031 BUT I MEAN THE MASS OF HIS WORK HE'S TREMENDOUS LIKE TOLSTOI THEY BOTH LOOK THINGS IN THE FACE AND SOMEHOW DIFFERENT AS THEY ARE STAND FOR SOMEWHAT THE SAME THINGS YOU HAVE ME STUMPED BURNE AMORY ADMITTED I'VE READ ANNA KARENINA
249-121331-0032 AND THE KREUTZER SONATA OF COURSE BUT TOLSTOI IS MOSTLY IN THE ORIGINAL RUSSIAN AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED HE'S THE GREATEST MAN IN HUNDREDS OF YEARS CRIED BURNE ENTHUSIASTICALLY
249-121331-0033 THEY TALKED UNTIL THREE FROM BIOLOGY TO ORGANIZED RELIGION AND WHEN AMORY CREPT SHIVERING INTO BED
249-121331-0034 BURNE HOLIDAY WAS SO EVIDENTLY DEVELOPING
249-121331-0035 PLOTTED THE IMPERFECTABILITY OF MAN AND READ SHAW AND CHESTERTON ENOUGH TO KEEP HIS MIND FROM THE EDGES OF DECADENCE
249-121331-0036 A PETTY CONSUMMATION OF HIMSELF AND LIKE A SOMBRE BACKGROUND LAY THAT INCIDENT OF THE SPRING BEFORE THAT FILLED HALF HIS NIGHTS WITH A DREARY TERROR AND MADE HIM UNABLE TO PRAY
249-121331-0037 THE GAUDY RITUALISTIC PARADOXICAL CATHOLICISM WHOSE PROPHET WAS CHESTERTON
249-121331-0038 WITH HIS ADULATION OF THIRTEENTH CENTURY CATHEDRALS A CATHOLICISM WHICH AMORY FOUND CONVENIENT AND READY MADE WITHOUT PRIEST OR SACRAMENTS OR SACRIFICE
249-121331-0039 SO HE TURNED ON HIS READING LAMP AND TAKING DOWN THE KREUTZER SONATA SEARCHED IT CAREFULLY FOR THE GERMS OF BURNE'S ENTHUSIASM BEING BURNE WAS SUDDENLY SO MUCH REALLER THAN BEING CLEVER YET HE SIGHED HERE WERE OTHER POSSIBLE CLAY FEET
249-121331-0040 QUITE SUBMERGED IN HIS BROTHER'S PERSONALITY
249-121331-0041 IN THE COURSE OF THE ALTERCATION THE DEAN REMARKED THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL BUY THE TAXICAB HE PAID AND WALKED OFF BUT NEXT MORNING HE ENTERED HIS PRIVATE OFFICE TO FIND THE TAXICAB ITSELF IN THE SPACE USUALLY OCCUPIED BY HIS DESK BEARING A SIGN WHICH READ
249-121331-0042 PROPERTY OF DEAN HOLLISTER BOUGHT AND PAID FOR
249-121331-0043 WHICH ONLY GOES TO PROVE THE RARE ENERGY OF SOPHOMORE HUMOR UNDER EFFICIENT LEADERSHIP THEN AGAIN THAT VERY FALL BURNE HAD CAUSED A SENSATION A CERTAIN PHYLLIS STYLES AN INTERCOLLEGIATE PROM TROTTER HAD FAILED TO GET HER YEARLY INVITATION TO THE HARVARD PRINCETON GAME
249-121331-0044 IF YOU ASK ME CRIED PHYLLIS QUICKLY OF COURSE I DO SAID BURNE FEEBLY
249-121331-0045 PHYLLIS HAD PINNED HIM DOWN AND SERVED HIM UP
249-121331-0046 AND DEPRESSED HIM THOROUGHLY ASIDE FROM LOATHING PHYLLIS
249-121331-0047 AND ENTERTAIN SOME HARVARD FRIENDS SHE'LL SEE HE INFORMED A DELEGATION WHO ARRIVED IN HIS ROOM TO JOSH HIM
249-121331-0048 BURNE YOU KNOW YOU'RE SECRETLY MAD ABOUT HER THAT'S THE REAL TROUBLE WHAT CAN YOU DO BURNE WHAT CAN YOU DO AGAINST PHYLLIS BUT BURNE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MUTTERED THREATS WHICH CONSISTED LARGELY OF THE PHRASE SHE'LL SEE SHE'LL SEE
249-121331-0049 THE BLITHESOME PHYLLIS BORE HER TWENTY FIVE SUMMERS GAYLY FROM THE TRAIN BUT ON THE PLATFORM A GHASTLY SIGHT MET HER EYES
249-121331-0050 AND GIGANTIC PADDED SHOULDERS ON THEIR HEADS WERE RAKISH COLLEGE HATS PINNED UP IN FRONT AND SPORTING BRIGHT ORANGE AND BLACK BANDS WHILE FROM THEIR CELLULOID COLLARS BLOSSOMED FLAMING ORANGE TIES THEY WORE BLACK ARM BANDS WITH ORANGE P'S AND CARRIED CANES FLYING PRINCETON PENNANTS
249-121331-0051 TORN BETWEEN HORRIFIED PITY AND RIOTOUS MIRTH AND AS PHYLLIS WITH HER SVELTE JAW DROPPING APPROACHED THE PAIR BENT OVER AND EMITTED A COLLEGE CHEER IN LOUD FAR CARRYING VOICES THOUGHTFULLY ADDING THE NAME PHYLLIS TO THE END
249-121331-0052 SHE WAS VOCIFEROUSLY GREETED AND ESCORTED ENTHUSIASTICALLY ACROSS THE CAMPUS FOLLOWED BY HALF A HUNDRED VILLAGE URCHINS TO THE STIFLED LAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF ALUMNI AND VISITORS HALF OF WHOM HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS WAS A PRACTICAL JOKE
249-121331-0053 BUT THOUGHT THAT BURNE AND FRED WERE TWO VARSITY SPORTS SHOWING THEIR GIRL A COLLEGIATE TIME PHYLLIS'S FEELINGS AS SHE WAS PARADED BY THE HARVARD AND PRINCETON STANDS WHERE SAT DOZENS OF HER FORMER DEVOTEES CAN BE IMAGINED SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE AHEAD
249-121331-0054 SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE BEHIND BUT THEY STAYED CLOSE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT WHOM SHE WAS WITH TALKING IN LOUD VOICES OF THEIR FRIENDS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM UNTIL SHE COULD ALMOST HEAR HER ACQUAINTANCES WHISPERING
249-121331-0055 THAT HAD BEEN BURNE DYNAMICALLY HUMOROUS FUNDAMENTALLY SERIOUS
249-121331-0056 ABOUT A HUNDRED JUNIORS AND SENIORS RESIGNED FROM THEIR CLUBS IN A FINAL FURY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE CLUBS IN HELPLESSNESS TURNED UPON BURNE THEIR FINEST WEAPON RIDICULE EVERY ONE WHO KNEW HIM LIKED HIM BUT WHAT HE STOOD FOR AND HE BEGAN TO STAND FOR MORE ALL THE TIME
249-121331-0057 CAME UNDER THE LASH OF MANY TONGUES UNTIL A FRAILER MAN THAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SNOWED UNDER DON'T YOU MIND LOSING PRESTIGE ASKED AMORY ONE NIGHT THEY HAD TAKEN TO EXCHANGING CALLS SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK OF COURSE I DON'T WHAT'S PRESTIGE AT BEST
249-121331-0058 SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU'RE JUST A RATHER ORIGINAL POLITICIAN HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER THAT'S WHAT FRED SLOANE TOLD ME TO DAY I SUPPOSE I HAVE IT COMING ONE AFTERNOON THEY DIPPED INTO A SUBJECT THAT HAD INTERESTED AMORY FOR A LONG TIME
249-121331-0059 OF COURSE HEALTH COUNTS A HEALTHY MAN HAS TWICE THE CHANCE OF BEING GOOD HE SAID I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU I DON'T BELIEVE IN MUSCULAR CHRISTIANITY I DO I BELIEVE CHRIST HAD GREAT PHYSICAL VIGOR
249-121331-0060 OH NO AMORY PROTESTED HE WORKED TOO HARD FOR THAT I IMAGINE THAT WHEN HE DIED HE WAS A BROKEN DOWN MAN AND THE GREAT SAINTS HAVEN'T BEEN STRONG HALF OF THEM HAVE WELL EVEN GRANTING THAT I DON'T THINK HEALTH HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH GOODNESS OF COURSE
249-121331-0061 BUT THIS FAD OF POPULAR PREACHERS RISING ON THEIR TOES IN SIMULATED VIRILITY
249-121331-0062 NO BURNE I CAN'T GO THAT WELL LET'S WAIVE IT WE WON'T GET ANYWHERE AND BESIDES I HAVEN'T QUITE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT MYSELF NOW HERE'S SOMETHING I DO KNOW PERSONAL APPEARANCE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT COLORING
249-121331-0063 AMORY ASKED EAGERLY YES THAT'S WHAT TOM AND I FIGURED AMORY AGREED
249-121331-0064 BUT IT DOES REPRESENT SUCCESS HERE IN A GENERAL WAY WELL I SUPPOSE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF EVERY CLASS HERE ARE BLONDS ARE REALLY LIGHT YET TWO THIRDS OF EVERY SENIOR COUNCIL ARE LIGHT WE LOOKED AT PICTURES OF TEN YEARS OF THEM MIND YOU
249-121331-0065 ONE IS ON THE SENIOR COUNCIL AND OF THE DARK HAIRED MEN IT'S ONLY ONE IN FIFTY IT'S TRUE BURNE AGREED THE LIGHT HAIRED MAN IS A HIGHER TYPE GENERALLY SPEAKING
249-121331-0066 YET THINK OF THE PREPONDERANT NUMBER OF BRUNETTES IN THE RACE PEOPLE UNCONSCIOUSLY ADMIT IT SAID AMORY YOU'LL NOTICE A BLOND PERSON IS EXPECTED TO TALK IF A BLOND GIRL DOESN'T TALK WE CALL HER A DOLL IF A LIGHT HAIRED MAN IS SILENT HE'S CONSIDERED STUPID
249-121331-0067 YET THE WORLD IS FULL OF DARK SILENT MEN AND LANGUOROUS BRUNETTES
249-121331-0068 BUT SOMEHOW ARE NEVER ACCUSED OF THE DEARTH AND THE LARGE MOUTH AND BROAD CHIN AND RATHER BIG NOSE UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE THE SUPERIOR FACE I'M NOT SO SURE AMORY WAS ALL FOR CLASSICAL FEATURES OH YES I'LL SHOW YOU AND BURNE PULLED OUT OF HIS DESK
249-121331-0069 A PHOTOGRAPHIC COLLECTION OF HEAVILY BEARDED SHAGGY CELEBRITIES TOLSTOI WHITMAN CARPENTER AND OTHERS AREN'T THEY WONDERFUL AMORY TRIED POLITELY TO APPRECIATE THEM AND GAVE UP LAUGHINGLY BURNE
249-121331-0070 I THINK THEY'RE THE UGLIEST LOOKING CROWD I EVER CAME ACROSS
249-121331-0071 OH AMORY LOOK AT THAT FOREHEAD ON EMERSON LOOK AT TOLSTOI'S EYES HIS TONE WAS REPROACHFUL AMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD NO CALL THEM REMARKABLE LOOKING
249-121331-0072 UNABASHED BURNE RAN HIS HAND LOVINGLY ACROSS THE SPACIOUS FOREHEADS AND PILING UP THE PICTURES PUT THEM BACK IN HIS DESK WALKING AT NIGHT WAS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE PURSUITS AND ONE NIGHT HE PERSUADED AMORY TO ACCOMPANY HIM
249-121331-0073 I HATE THE DARK AMORY OBJECTED I DIDN'T USE TO EXCEPT WHEN I WAS PARTICULARLY IMAGINATIVE BUT NOW I REALLY DO I'M A REGULAR FOOL ABOUT IT THAT'S USELESS YOU KNOW QUITE POSSIBLY
249-121331-0074 WE'LL GO EAST BURNE SUGGESTED AND DOWN THAT STRING OF ROADS THROUGH THE WOODS DOESN'T SOUND VERY APPEALING TO ME ADMITTED AMORY RELUCTANTLY BUT LET'S GO
249-121331-0075 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHY I CAN WALK ANYWHERE NOW AND NOT BE AFRAID GO ON AMORY URGED EAGERLY THEY WERE STRIDING TOWARD THE WOODS BURNE'S NERVOUS ENTHUSIASTIC VOICE WARMING TO HIS SUBJECT I USED TO COME OUT HERE ALONE AT NIGHT
249-121331-0076 OH THREE MONTHS AGO AND I ALWAYS STOPPED AT THAT CROSS ROAD WE JUST PASSED THERE WERE THE WOODS LOOMING UP AHEAD JUST AS THEY DO NOW
249-121331-0077 OF COURSE I PEOPLED THE WOODS WITH EVERYTHING GHASTLY JUST LIKE YOU DO DON'T YOU I DO AMORY ADMITTED WELL I BEGAN ANALYZING IT
249-121331-0078 AND LET IT LOOK OUT AT ME I LET IT PLAY STRAY DOG OR ESCAPED CONVICT OR GHOST AND THEN SAW MYSELF COMING ALONG THE ROAD THAT MADE IT ALL RIGHT AS IT ALWAYS MAKES EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT TO PROJECT YOURSELF COMPLETELY INTO ANOTHER'S PLACE
249-121331-0079 I KNEW THAT IF I WERE THE DOG OR THE CONVICT OR THE GHOST I WOULDN'T BE A MENACE TO BURNE HOLIDAY ANY MORE THAN HE WAS A MENACE TO ME THEN I THOUGHT OF MY WATCH I'D BETTER GO BACK AND LEAVE IT AND THEN ESSAY THE WOODS NO I DECIDED IT'S BETTER ON THE WHOLE THAT I SHOULD LOSE A WATCH
249-121331-0080 THAN THAT I SHOULD TURN BACK AND I DID GO INTO THEM NOT ONLY FOLLOWED THE ROAD THROUGH THEM BUT WALKED INTO THEM UNTIL I WASN'T FRIGHTENED ANY MORE
249-121331-0081 THEN I KNEW I WAS THROUGH BEING AFRAID OF THE DARK LORDY AMORY BREATHED
249-121331-0082 I'D HAVE COME IN WELL BURNE SAID SUDDENLY AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE WE'RE HALF WAY THROUGH LET'S TURN BACK ON THE RETURN HE LAUNCHED INTO A DISCUSSION OF WILL IT'S THE WHOLE THING HE ASSERTED
249-121331-0083 IT'S THE ONE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL I'VE NEVER MET A MAN WHO LED A ROTTEN LIFE AND DIDN'T HAVE A WEAK WILL HOW ABOUT GREAT CRIMINALS THEY'RE USUALLY INSANE IF NOT THEY'RE WEAK THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A STRONG SANE CRIMINAL
249-121331-0084 BURNE I DISAGREE WITH YOU ALTOGETHER HOW ABOUT THE SUPERMAN WELL HE'S EVIL I THINK YET HE'S STRONG AND SANE I'VE NEVER MET HIM I'LL BET THOUGH THAT HE'S STUPID OR INSANE I'VE MET HIM OVER AND OVER AND HE'S NEITHER
249-121331-0085 THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU'RE WRONG I'M SURE I'M NOT AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN IMPRISONMENT EXCEPT FOR THE INSANE ON THIS POINT AMORY COULD NOT AGREE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT LIFE AND HISTORY WERE RIFE WITH THE STRONG CRIMINAL KEEN BUT OFTEN SELF DELUDING
249-121331-0086 IN POLITICS AND BUSINESS ONE FOUND HIM AND AMONG THE OLD STATESMEN AND KINGS AND GENERALS
249-121331-0087 BURNE WAS DRAWING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE WORLD ABOUT HIM HE RESIGNED THE VICE PRESIDENCY OF THE SENIOR CLASS AND TOOK TO READING AND WALKING AS ALMOST HIS ONLY PURSUITS HE VOLUNTARILY ATTENDED GRADUATE LECTURES IN PHILOSOPHY AND BIOLOGY
249-121331-0088 AS IF WAITING FOR SOMETHING THE LECTURER WOULD NEVER QUITE COME TO SOMETIMES AMORY WOULD SEE HIM SQUIRM IN HIS SEAT AND HIS FACE WOULD LIGHT UP HE WAS ON FIRE TO DEBATE A POINT HE GREW MORE ABSTRACTED ON THE STREET
249-121331-0089 AND WAS EVEN ACCUSED OF BECOMING A SNOB BUT AMORY KNEW IT WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT AND ONCE WHEN BURNE PASSED HIM FOUR FEET OFF ABSOLUTELY UNSEEINGLY HIS MIND A THOUSAND MILES AWAY AMORY ALMOST CHOKED WITH THE ROMANTIC JOY OF WATCHING HIM
249-121331-0090 BURNE SEEMED TO BE CLIMBING HEIGHTS WHERE OTHERS WOULD BE FOREVER UNABLE TO GET A FOOTHOLD I TELL YOU AMORY DECLARED TO TOM HE'S THE FIRST CONTEMPORARY I'VE EVER MET
249-121331-0091 IT'S A BAD TIME TO ADMIT IT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO THINK HE'S ODD HE'S WAY OVER THEIR HEADS

249-121331-0095 THAT THE PEOPLE WHO VIOLENTLY DISAPPROVE OF BURNE'S RADICALISM ARE DISTINCTLY THE PHARISEE CLASS I MEAN THEY'RE THE BEST EDUCATED MEN IN COLLEGE
249-121331-0096 THE YOUNGER PROFESSORS THE ILLITERATE ATHLETES LIKE LANGUEDUC THINK HE'S GETTING ECCENTRIC BUT THEY JUST SAY GOOD OLD BURNE HAS GOT SOME QUEER IDEAS IN HIS HEAD AND PASS ON THE PHARISEE CLASS GEE THEY RIDICULE HIM UNMERCIFULLY
