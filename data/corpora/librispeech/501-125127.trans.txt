501-125127-0000 THE BIRD OF PREY BROUGHT DOWN COLD ON THE SHORE IN THE RAW COLD OF THAT LEADEN CRISIS IN THE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WHEN THE VITAL FORCE OF ALL THE NOBLEST AND PRETTIEST THINGS THAT LIVE IS AT ITS LOWEST
501-125127-0001 THE THREE WATCHERS LOOKED EACH AT THE BLANK FACES OF THE OTHER TWO
501-125127-0002 GAFFER'S BOAT GAFFER IN LUCK AGAIN AND YET NO GAFFER SO SPAKE RIDERHOOD STARING DISCONSOLATE
501-125127-0003 IT WAS FAINTER AND DULLER PERHAPS FIRE LIKE THE HIGHER ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE IT HELPS TO SUSTAIN HAS ITS GREATEST TENDENCY TOWARDS DEATH WHEN THE NIGHT IS DYING AND THE DAY IS NOT YET BORN
501-125127-0004 IF IT WAS ME THAT HAD THE LAW OF THIS HERE JOB IN HAND GROWLED RIDERHOOD WITH A THREATENING SHAKE OF HIS HEAD BLEST IF I WOULDN'T LAY HOLD OF HER AT ANY RATE AY BUT IT IS NOT YOU SAID EUGENE
501-125127-0005 WITH SOMETHING SO SUDDENLY FIERCE IN HIM THAT THE INFORMER RETURNED SUBMISSIVELY WELL WELL WELL T'OTHER GOVERNOR I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A MAN MAY SPEAK AND VERMIN MAY BE SILENT SAID EUGENE
501-125127-0006 HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU WATER RAT ASTONISHED BY HIS FRIEND'S UNUSUAL HEAT LIGHTWOOD STARED TOO AND THEN SAID WHAT CAN HAVE BECOME OF THIS MAN CAN'T IMAGINE UNLESS HE DIVED OVERBOARD
501-125127-0007 THE INFORMER WIPED HIS BROW RUEFULLY AS HE SAID IT SITTING IN HIS BOAT AND ALWAYS STARING DISCONSOLATE DID YOU MAKE HIS BOAT FAST SHE'S FAST ENOUGH TILL THE TIDE RUNS BACK I COULDN'T MAKE HER FASTER THAN SHE IS
501-125127-0008 COME ABOARD OF MINE AND SEE FOR YOUR OWN SELVES THERE WAS A LITTLE BACKWARDNESS IN COMPLYING FOR THE FREIGHT LOOKED TOO MUCH FOR THE BOAT BUT ON RIDERHOOD'S PROTESTING
501-125127-0009 THAT HE HAD HAD HALF A DOZEN DEAD AND ALIVE IN HER AFORE NOW AND SHE WAS NOTHING DEEP IN THE WATER NOR DOWN IN THE STERN EVEN THEN TO SPEAK OF THEY CAREFULLY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND TRIMMED THE CRAZY THING WHILE THEY WERE DOING SO RIDERHOOD STILL SAT STARING DISCONSOLATE
501-125127-0010 ALL RIGHT GIVE WAY SAID LIGHTWOOD GIVE WAY BY GEORGE REPEATED RIDERHOOD BEFORE SHOVING OFF IF HE'S GONE AND MADE OFF ANY HOW LAWYER LIGHTWOOD IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ME GIVE WAY IN A DIFFERENT MANNER
501-125127-0011 BUT HE ALWAYS WAS A CHEAT CON FOUND HIM HE ALWAYS WAS A INFERNAL CHEAT WAS GAFFER NOTHING STRAIGHTFOR'ARD NOTHING ON THE SQUARE SO MEAN SO UNDERHANDED NEVER GOING THROUGH WITH A THING NOR CARRYING IT OUT LIKE A MAN HALLO STEADY
501-125127-0012 AS THEY BUMPED HEAVILY AGAINST A PILE AND THEN IN A LOWER VOICE REVERSED HIS LATE APOSTROPHE BY REMARKING I WISH THE BOAT OF MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND MAY BE ENDOWED WITH PHILANTHROPY ENOUGH NOT TO TURN BOTTOM UPWARD AND EXTINGUISH US STEADY STEADY SIT CLOSE MORTIMER
501-125127-0013 THAT HE DROPPED UNDER THE LEE OF A TIER OF SHIPPING AND THEY LAY THERE UNTIL IT WAS OVER THE SQUALL HAD COME UP LIKE A SPITEFUL MESSENGER BEFORE THE MORNING THERE FOLLOWED IN ITS WAKE A RAGGED TEAR OF LIGHT WHICH RIPPED THE DARK CLOUDS UNTIL THEY SHOWED A GREAT GREY HOLE OF DAY
501-125127-0014 THEY WERE ALL SHIVERING AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM SEEMED TO BE SHIVERING THE RIVER ITSELF CRAFT RIGGING SAILS SUCH EARLY SMOKE AS THERE YET WAS ON THE SHORE BLACK WITH WET AND ALTERED TO THE EYE BY WHITE PATCHES OF HAIL AND SLEET
501-125127-0015 THE HUDDLED BUILDINGS LOOKED LOWER THAN USUAL AS IF THEY WERE COWERING AND HAD SHRUNK WITH THE COLD VERY LITTLE LIFE WAS TO BE SEEN ON EITHER BANK WINDOWS AND DOORS WERE SHUT
501-125127-0016 ALL THE OBJECTS AMONG WHICH THEY CREPT WERE SO HUGE IN CONTRAST WITH THEIR WRETCHED BOAT AS TO THREATEN TO CRUSH IT NOT A SHIP'S HULL WITH ITS RUSTY IRON LINKS OF CABLE RUN OUT OF HAWSE HOLES LONG DISCOLOURED WITH THE IRON'S RUSTY TEARS
501-125127-0017 BUT SEEMED TO BE THERE WITH A FELL INTENTION NOT A FIGURE HEAD BUT HAD THE MENACING LOOK OF BURSTING FORWARD TO RUN THEM DOWN NOT A SLUICE GATE
501-125127-0018 THAT'S TO DROWN YOU IN MY DEARS NOT A LUMBERING BLACK BARGE WITH ITS CRACKED AND BLISTERED SIDE IMPENDING OVER THEM BUT SEEMED TO SUCK AT THE RIVER WITH A THIRST FOR SUCKING THEM UNDER AND EVERYTHING SO VAUNTED THE SPOILING INFLUENCES OF WATER
501-125127-0019 DISCOLOURED COPPER ROTTEN WOOD HONEY COMBED STONE GREEN DANK DEPOSIT THAT THE AFTER CONSEQUENCES OF BEING CRUSHED SUCKED UNDER AND DRAWN DOWN LOOKED AS UGLY TO THE IMAGINATION AS THE MAIN EVENT
501-125127-0020 SOME HALF HOUR OF THIS WORK AND RIDERHOOD UNSHIPPED HIS SCULLS STOOD HOLDING ON TO A BARGE AND HAND OVER HAND LONG WISE ALONG THE BARGE'S SIDE GRADUALLY WORKED HIS BOAT UNDER HER HEAD INTO A SECRET LITTLE NOOK OF SCUMMY WATER
501-125127-0021 AND DRIVEN INTO THAT NOOK AND WEDGED AS HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS GAFFER'S BOAT THAT BOAT WITH THE STAIN STILL IN IT BEARING SOME RESEMBLANCE TO A MUFFLED HUMAN FORM NOW TELL ME I'M A LIAR SAID THE HONEST MAN
501-125127-0022 WITH A MORBID EXPECTATION MURMURED EUGENE TO LIGHTWOOD THAT SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS GOING TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH THIS IS HEXAM'S BOAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
501-125127-0023 LOOK AT THE BROKEN SCULL LOOK AT THE T'OTHER SCULL GONE NOW TELL ME I AM A LIAR SAID THE HONEST MAN MISTER INSPECTOR STEPPED INTO THE BOAT EUGENE AND MORTIMER LOOKED ON AND SEE NOW

501-125127-0029 AND LEANING WELL OVER THE STERN WITH A WILL COME IT WAS AN AWFUL SORT OF FISHING BUT IT NO MORE DISCONCERTED MISTER INSPECTOR THAN IF HE HAD BEEN FISHING IN A PUNT ON A SUMMER EVENING BY SOME SOOTHING WEIR HIGH UP THE PEACEFUL RIVER
501-125127-0030 AFTER CERTAIN MINUTES AND A FEW DIRECTIONS TO THE REST TO EASE HER A LITTLE FOR'ARD AND NOW EASE HER A TRIFLE AFT AND THE LIKE HE SAID COMPOSEDLY ALL CLEAR AND THE LINE AND THE BOAT CAME FREE TOGETHER
501-125127-0031 ACCEPTING LIGHTWOOD'S PROFFERED HAND TO HELP HIM UP HE THEN PUT ON HIS COAT AND SAID TO RIDERHOOD HAND ME OVER THOSE SPARE SCULLS OF YOURS AND I'LL PULL THIS IN TO THE NEAREST STAIRS GO AHEAD YOU AND KEEP OUT IN PRETTY OPEN WATER THAT I MAYN'T GET FOULED AGAIN
501-125127-0032 HIS DIRECTIONS WERE OBEYED AND THEY PULLED ASHORE DIRECTLY TWO IN ONE BOAT TWO IN THE OTHER NOW SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AGAIN TO RIDERHOOD WHEN THEY WERE ALL ON THE SLUSHY STONES YOU HAVE HAD MORE PRACTICE IN THIS THAN I HAVE HAD

501-125127-0034 WHEN HE CAME SCRAMBLING BACK AS PALE AS THE MORNING AND GASPED OUT BY THE LORD HE'S DONE ME
501-125127-0035 HE POINTED BEHIND HIM AT THE BOAT AND GASPED TO THAT DEGREE THAT HE DROPPED UPON THE STONES TO GET HIS BREATH GAFFER'S DONE ME IT'S GAFFER THEY RAN TO THE ROPE LEAVING HIM GASPING THERE SOON THE FORM OF THE BIRD OF PREY

501-125127-0043 AND YOU WILL OBSERVE NOW THAT THIS KNOT WHICH WAS DRAWN CHOCK TIGHT ROUND HIS NECK BY THE STRAIN OF HIS OWN ARMS IS A SLIP KNOT HOLDING IT UP FOR DEMONSTRATION PLAIN ENOUGH
501-125127-0044 IT HAD THE CURVES AND INDENTATIONS IN IT STILL

501-125127-0056 EUGENE SAID LIGHTWOOD AND WAS ABOUT TO ADD WE MAY WAIT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WHEN TURNING HIS HEAD HE FOUND THAT NO EUGENE WAS THERE HE RAISED HIS VOICE AND CALLED EUGENE HOLLOA BUT NO EUGENE REPLIED
501-125127-0057 IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT NOW AND HE LOOKED ABOUT BUT NO EUGENE WAS IN ALL THE VIEW MISTER INSPECTOR SPEEDILY RETURNING DOWN THE WOODEN STAIRS WITH A POLICE CONSTABLE LIGHTWOOD ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN HIS FRIEND LEAVE THEM MISTER INSPECTOR
501-125127-0058 COULD NOT EXACTLY SAY THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM GO BUT HAD NOTICED THAT HE WAS RESTLESS SINGULAR AND ENTERTAINING COMBINATION SIR YOUR FRIEND
501-125127-0059 SAID LIGHTWOOD CAN WE GET ANYTHING HOT TO DRINK WE COULD AND WE DID IN A PUBLIC HOUSE KITCHEN WITH A LARGE FIRE
501-125127-0060 MISTER INSPECTOR HAVING TO MISTER RIDERHOOD ANNOUNCED HIS OFFICIAL INTENTION OF KEEPING HIS EYE UPON HIM STOOD HIM IN A CORNER OF THE FIREPLACE LIKE A WET UMBRELLA AND TOOK NO FURTHER OUTWARD AND VISIBLE NOTICE OF THAT HONEST MAN
501-125127-0061 AS MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD SAT BEFORE THE BLAZING FIRE CONSCIOUS OF DRINKING BRANDY AND WATER THEN AND THERE IN HIS SLEEP AND YET AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME DRINKING BURNT SHERRY AT THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIPS AND LYING UNDER THE BOAT ON THE RIVER SHORE AND SITTING IN THE BOAT THAT RIDERHOOD ROWED
501-125127-0062 AND LISTENING TO THE LECTURE RECENTLY CONCLUDED AND HAVING TO DINE IN THE TEMPLE WITH AN UNKNOWN MAN WHO DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS M H F EUGENE GAFFER HARMON AND SAID HE LIVED AT HAILSTORM
501-125127-0063 AS HE PASSED THROUGH THESE CURIOUS VICISSITUDES OF FATIGUE AND SLUMBER ARRANGED UPON THE SCALE OF A DOZEN HOURS TO THE SECOND HE BECAME AWARE OF ANSWERING ALOUD A COMMUNICATION OF PRESSING IMPORTANCE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN MADE TO HIM AND THEN TURNED IT INTO A COUGH ON BEHOLDING MISTER INSPECTOR
501-125127-0064 FOR HE FELT WITH SOME NATURAL INDIGNATION THAT THAT FUNCTIONARY MIGHT OTHERWISE SUSPECT HIM OF HAVING CLOSED HIS EYES OR WANDERED IN HIS ATTENTION HERE JUST BEFORE US YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR I SEE SAID LIGHTWOOD WITH DIGNITY
501-125127-0065 AND HAD HOT BRANDY AND WATER TOO YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AND THEN CUT OFF AT A GREAT RATE WHO SAID LIGHTWOOD YOUR FRIEND YOU KNOW I KNOW HE REPLIED AGAIN WITH DIGNITY AFTER HEARING IN A MIST THROUGH WHICH MISTER INSPECTOR LOOMED VAGUE AND LARGE
501-125127-0066 THAT THE OFFICER TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO PREPARE THE DEAD MAN'S DAUGHTER FOR WHAT HAD BEFALLEN IN THE NIGHT AND GENERALLY THAT HE TOOK EVERYTHING UPON HIMSELF MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD STUMBLED IN HIS SLEEP TO A CAB STAND CALLED A CAB
501-125127-0067 AND FOUND GUILTY AND HAD ARRANGED HIS AFFAIRS AND BEEN MARCHED OUT TO BE SHOT BEFORE THE DOOR BANGED HARD WORK ROWING THE CAB THROUGH THE CITY TO THE TEMPLE FOR A CUP OF FROM FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND POUNDS VALUE GIVEN BY MISTER BOFFIN
501-125127-0068 AND HARD WORK HOLDING FORTH AT THAT IMMEASURABLE LENGTH TO EUGENE WHEN HE HAD BEEN RESCUED WITH A ROPE FROM THE RUNNING PAVEMENT FOR MAKING OFF IN THAT EXTRAORDINARY MANNER BUT HE OFFERED SUCH AMPLE APOLOGIES AND WAS SO VERY PENITENT
501-125127-0069 THAT HE HAD BECOME A MERE SOMNAMBULIST HE WAS TOO TIRED TO REST IN HIS SLEEP UNTIL HE WAS EVEN TIRED OUT OF BEING TOO TIRED AND DROPPED INTO OBLIVION LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE AWOKE
501-125127-0070 WHY WHAT BLOODSHOT DRAGGLED DISHEVELLED SPECTACLE IS THIS CRIED MORTIMER
501-125127-0071 BUT CONSIDER SUCH A NIGHT FOR PLUMAGE SUCH A NIGHT REPEATED MORTIMER WHAT BECAME OF YOU IN THE MORNING MY DEAR FELLOW SAID EUGENE SITTING ON HIS BED I FELT THAT WE HAD BORED ONE ANOTHER SO LONG
501-125127-0072 THAT AN UNBROKEN CONTINUANCE OF THOSE RELATIONS MUST INEVITABLY TERMINATE IN OUR FLYING TO OPPOSITE POINTS OF THE EARTH I ALSO FELT THAT I HAD COMMITTED EVERY CRIME IN THE NEWGATE CALENDAR SO FOR MINGLED CONSIDERATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND FELONY
