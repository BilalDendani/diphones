580-126947-0000 AND CORINTHIAN AND PELOPONNESIAN CITIZENS WITHIN IT WERE BEING BESIEGED THAT OF ATHENS AGAINST THE PELOPONNESIANS THAT THEY HAD INCITED A TOWN OF HERS A MEMBER OF HER ALLIANCE AND A CONTRIBUTOR TO HER REVENUE TO REVOLT
580-126947-0001 AND HAD COME AND WERE OPENLY FIGHTING AGAINST HER ON THE SIDE OF THE POTIDAEANS FOR ALL THIS WAR HAD NOT YET BROKEN OUT THERE WAS STILL TRUCE FOR A WHILE FOR THIS WAS A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE ON THE PART OF CORINTH
580-126947-0002 BUT THE SIEGE OF POTIDAEA PUT AN END TO HER INACTION SHE HAD MEN INSIDE IT BESIDES SHE FEARED FOR THE PLACE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONING THE ALLIES TO LACEDAEMON
580-126947-0003 SHE CAME AND LOUDLY ACCUSED ATHENS OF BREACH OF THE TREATY AND AGGRESSION ON THE RIGHTS OF PELOPONNESE WITH HER THE AEGINETANS FORMALLY UNREPRESENTED FROM FEAR OF ATHENS IN SECRET PROVED NOT THE LEAST URGENT OF THE ADVOCATES FOR WAR
580-126947-0004 HELD THEIR ORDINARY ASSEMBLY AND INVITED THEM TO SPEAK THERE WERE MANY WHO CAME FORWARD AND MADE THEIR SEVERAL ACCUSATIONS AMONG THEM THE MEGARIANS IN A LONG LIST OF GRIEVANCES CALLED SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE FACT OF THEIR EXCLUSION FROM THE PORTS OF THE ATHENIAN EMPIRE
580-126947-0005 AND THE MARKET OF ATHENS IN DEFIANCE OF THE TREATY LAST OF ALL THE CORINTHIANS CAME FORWARD AND HAVING LET THOSE WHO PRECEDED THEM INFLAME THE LACEDAEMONIANS NOW FOLLOWED WITH A SPEECH TO THIS EFFECT
580-126947-0006 THE CONFIDENCE WHICH YOU FEEL IN YOUR CONSTITUTION AND SOCIAL ORDER INCLINES YOU TO RECEIVE ANY REFLECTIONS OF OURS ON OTHER POWERS WITH A CERTAIN SCEPTICISM HENCE SPRINGS YOUR MODERATION BUT HENCE ALSO THE RATHER LIMITED KNOWLEDGE WHICH YOU BETRAY
580-126947-0007 IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLITICS TIME AFTER TIME WAS OUR VOICE RAISED TO WARN YOU OF THE BLOWS ABOUT TO BE DEALT US BY ATHENS AND TIME AFTER TIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE TROUBLE TO ASCERTAIN THE WORTH OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS
580-126947-0008 YOU CONTENTED YOURSELVES WITH SUSPECTING THE SPEAKERS OF BEING INSPIRED BY PRIVATE INTEREST AND SO INSTEAD OF CALLING THESE ALLIES TOGETHER BEFORE THE BLOW FELL YOU HAVE DELAYED TO DO SO TILL WE ARE SMARTING UNDER IT
580-126947-0009 ALLIES AMONG WHOM WE HAVE NOT THE WORST TITLE TO SPEAK AS HAVING THE GREATEST COMPLAINTS TO MAKE COMPLAINTS OF ATHENIAN OUTRAGE AND LACEDAEMONIAN NEGLECT NOW IF THESE ASSAULTS ON THE RIGHTS OF HELLAS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE DARK
580-126947-0010 AS IT IS LONG SPEECHES ARE NOT NEEDED WHERE YOU SEE SERVITUDE ACCOMPLISHED FOR SOME OF US MEDITATED FOR OTHERS IN PARTICULAR FOR OUR ALLIES AND PROLONGED PREPARATIONS IN THE AGGRESSOR AGAINST THE HOUR OF WAR OR WHAT PRAY
580-126947-0011 FOR THE TRUE AUTHOR OF THE SUBJUGATION OF A PEOPLE IS NOT SO MUCH THE IMMEDIATE AGENT
580-126947-0012 PARTICULARLY IF THAT POWER ASPIRES TO THE GLORY OF BEING THE LIBERATOR OF HELLAS WE ARE AT LAST ASSEMBLED IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY TO ASSEMBLE NOR EVEN NOW ARE OUR OBJECTS DEFINED
580-126947-0013 HAVE CAST THREATS ASIDE AND BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO ACTION AND WE KNOW WHAT ARE THE PATHS BY WHICH ATHENIAN AGGRESSION TRAVELS
580-126947-0014 A DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE SHE MAY FEEL FROM THE IDEA THAT YOUR BLUNTNESS OF PERCEPTION PREVENTS YOUR NOTICING HER BUT IT IS NOTHING TO THE IMPULSE WHICH HER ADVANCE WILL RECEIVE FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SEE BUT DO NOT CARE TO INTERFERE
580-126947-0015 AND DEFEND YOURSELVES NOT BY DOING ANYTHING BUT BY LOOKING AS IF YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING YOU ALONE WAIT TILL THE POWER OF AN ENEMY IS BECOMING TWICE ITS ORIGINAL SIZE INSTEAD OF CRUSHING IT IN ITS INFANCY AND YET THE WORLD USED TO SAY
580-126947-0016 THAT YOU WERE TO BE DEPENDED UPON BUT IN YOUR CASE WE FEAR IT SAID MORE THAN THE TRUTH THE MEDE WE OURSELVES KNOW HAD TIME TO COME FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO PELOPONNESE
580-126947-0017 WITHOUT ANY FORCE OF YOURS WORTHY OF THE NAME ADVANCING TO MEET HIM BUT THIS WAS A DISTANT ENEMY WELL ATHENS AT ALL EVENTS IS A NEAR NEIGHBOUR AND YET ATHENS YOU UTTERLY DISREGARD
580-126947-0018 AGAINST ATHENS YOU PREFER TO ACT ON THE DEFENSIVE INSTEAD OF ON THE OFFENSIVE
580-126947-0019 INDEED EXPECTATIONS FROM YOU HAVE BEFORE NOW BEEN THE RUIN OF SOME WHOSE FAITH INDUCED THEM TO OMIT PREPARATION WE HOPE THAT NONE OF YOU WILL CONSIDER THESE WORDS OF REMONSTRANCE TO BE RATHER WORDS OF HOSTILITY
580-126947-0020 MEN REMONSTRATE WITH FRIENDS WHO ARE IN ERROR ACCUSATIONS THEY RESERVE FOR ENEMIES WHO HAVE WRONGED THEM BESIDES WE CONSIDER THAT WE HAVE AS GOOD A RIGHT AS ANY ONE TO POINT OUT A NEIGHBOUR'S FAULTS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE CONTEMPLATE
580-126947-0021 THE GREAT CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONAL CHARACTERS A CONTRAST OF WHICH AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE YOU HAVE LITTLE PERCEPTION HAVING NEVER YET CONSIDERED WHAT SORT OF ANTAGONISTS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN THE ATHENIANS HOW WIDELY
580-126947-0022 HOW ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT FROM YOURSELVES THE ATHENIANS ARE ADDICTED TO INNOVATION AND THEIR DESIGNS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SWIFTNESS ALIKE IN CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION YOU HAVE A GENIUS FOR KEEPING WHAT YOU HAVE GOT ACCOMPANIED BY A TOTAL WANT OF INVENTION
580-126947-0023 AND WHEN FORCED TO ACT YOU NEVER GO FAR ENOUGH AGAIN THEY ARE ADVENTUROUS BEYOND THEIR POWER AND DARING BEYOND THEIR JUDGMENT AND IN DANGER THEY ARE SANGUINE YOUR WONT IS TO ATTEMPT LESS THAN IS JUSTIFIED BY YOUR POWER
580-126947-0024 TO MISTRUST EVEN WHAT IS SANCTIONED BY YOUR JUDGMENT AND TO FANCY THAT FROM DANGER THERE IS NO RELEASE FURTHER THERE IS PROMPTITUDE ON THEIR SIDE AGAINST PROCRASTINATION ON YOURS THEY ARE NEVER AT HOME YOU ARE NEVER FROM IT
580-126947-0025 FOR THEY HOPE BY THEIR ABSENCE TO EXTEND THEIR ACQUISITIONS YOU FEAR BY YOUR ADVANCE TO ENDANGER WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEY ARE SWIFT TO FOLLOW UP A SUCCESS AND SLOW TO RECOIL FROM A REVERSE THEIR BODIES THEY SPEND UNGRUDGINGLY IN THEIR COUNTRY'S CAUSE
580-126947-0026 YOU STILL DELAY AND FAIL TO SEE THAT PEACE STAYS LONGEST WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT MORE CAREFUL TO USE THEIR POWER JUSTLY THAN TO SHOW THEIR DETERMINATION NOT TO SUBMIT TO INJUSTICE ON THE CONTRARY
580-126947-0027 BUT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE AS WE HAVE JUST SHOWN YOUR HABITS ARE OLD FASHIONED AS COMPARED WITH THEIRS IT IS THE LAW AS IN ART SO IN POLITICS THAT IMPROVEMENTS EVER PREVAIL
580-126947-0028 AND THOUGH FIXED USAGES MAY BE BEST FOR UNDISTURBED COMMUNITIES CONSTANT NECESSITIES OF ACTION MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS
580-126947-0029 BY A SPEEDY INVASION OF ATTICA AND DO NOT SACRIFICE FRIENDS AND KINDRED TO THEIR BITTEREST ENEMIES AND DRIVE THE REST OF US IN DESPAIR TO SOME OTHER ALLIANCE SUCH A STEP WOULD NOT BE CONDEMNED EITHER BY THE GODS WHO RECEIVED OUR OATHS OR BY THE MEN WHO WITNESSED THEM
580-126947-0030 THE BREACH OF A TREATY CANNOT BE LAID TO THE PEOPLE WHOM DESERTION COMPELS TO SEEK NEW RELATIONS BUT TO THE POWER THAT FAILS TO ASSIST ITS CONFEDERATE BUT IF YOU WILL ONLY ACT WE WILL STAND BY YOU IT WOULD BE UNNATURAL FOR US TO CHANGE
580-126947-0031 SUCH WERE THE WORDS OF THE CORINTHIANS
580-126947-0032 ON OTHER BUSINESS ON HEARING THE SPEECHES THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES CALLED UPON TO COME BEFORE THE LACEDAEMONIANS
580-126947-0033 THAT IT WAS NOT A MATTER TO BE HASTILY DECIDED ON BUT ONE THAT DEMANDED FURTHER CONSIDERATION
580-126947-0034 AND TO REFRESH THE MEMORY OF THE OLD AND ENLIGHTEN THE IGNORANCE OF THE YOUNG FROM A NOTION THAT THEIR WORDS MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF INDUCING THEM TO PREFER TRANQUILLITY TO WAR
