8334-119398-0000 HAD STRUCK AGAIN DOCTOR BIRD LOOKED UP IMPATIENTLY AS THE DOOR OF HIS PRIVATE LABORATORY IN THE BUREAU OF STANDARDS SWUNG OPEN BUT THE FROWN ON HIS FACE CHANGED TO A SMILE
8334-119398-0001 AS HE SAW THE FORM OF OPERATIVE CARNES OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY HELLO CARNES HE CALLED CHEERFULLY
8334-119398-0002 I'LL BE WITH YOU AS SOON AS I FINISH GETTING THIS WEIGHT CARNES SAT ON THE EDGE OF A BENCH AND WATCHED WITH ADMIRATION THE LONG NERVOUS HANDS AND THE SLIM TAPERING FINGERS OF THE FAMOUS SCIENTIST
8334-119398-0003 DOCTOR BIRD STOOD WELL OVER SIX FEET AND WEIGHED TWO HUNDRED AND SIX POUNDS STRIPPED HIS MASSIVE SHOULDERS AND HEAVY SHOCK OF UNRULY BLACK HAIR COMBINED TO GIVE HIM THE APPEARANCE OF A PRIZE FIGHTER UNTIL ONE LOOKED AT HIS HANDS
8334-119398-0004 ACID STAINS AND SCARS COULD NOT HIDE THE BEAUTY OF THOSE MOBILE HANDS THE HANDS OF AN ARTIST AND A DREAMER AN ARTIST DOCTOR BIRD WAS
8334-119398-0005 ALBEIT HIS ARTISTRY EXPRESSED ITSELF IN THE MOST DELICATE AND COMPLICATED EXPERIMENTS IN THE REALMS OF PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCE THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN RATHER THAN IN THE COMMONER FORMS OF ART
8334-119398-0006 THE DOCTOR FINISHED HIS TASK OF WEIGHING A PORCELAIN CRUCIBLE SET IT CAREFULLY INTO A DESSICATOR AND TURNED TO HIS FRIEND WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND CARNES HE ASKED YOU LOOK WORRIED IS THERE ANOTHER COUNTERFEIT ON THE MARKET THE OPERATIVE SHOOK HIS HEAD
8334-119398-0007 HAVE YOU BEEN READING THOSE STORIES THAT THE PAPERS HAVE BEEN CARRYING ABOUT MAMMOTH CAVE HE ASKED DOCTOR BIRD EMITTED A SNORT OF DISGUST I READ THE FIRST ONE OF THEM PART WAY THROUGH ON THE STRENGTH OF ITS BEING AN ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH HE REPLIED BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
8334-119398-0008 IT DIDN'T EXACTLY IMPRESS ME WITH ITS VERACITY AND FROM A VIEWPOINT OF LITERATURE THE THING WAS IMPOSSIBLE I HAVE NO TIME TO PORE OVER THE LUCUBRATIONS OF AN INSPIRED PRESS AGENT SO YOU DISMISSED THEM AS MERE PRESS AGENT WORK
8334-119398-0009 CERTAINLY WHAT ELSE COULD THEY BE THINGS LIKE THAT DON'T HAPPEN FORTUITOUSLY JUST AS THE TOURIST SEASON IS ABOUT TO OPEN
8334-119398-0010 THE PUBLIC ALWAYS RESPONDS WELL TO SEA SERPENT YARNS MAMMOTH CAVE HAS BEEN CLOSED TO VISITORS FOR THE SEASON SAID CARNES QUIETLY WHAT CRIED THE DOCTOR IN SURPRISE WAS THERE REALLY SOMETHING TO THOSE WILD YARNS THERE WAS
8334-119398-0011 AT LEAST THERE IS ENOUGH TO IT THAT I AM LEAVING FOR KENTUCKY THIS EVENING AND I CAME HERE FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF ASKING YOU WHETHER YOU WANTED TO COME ALONG
8334-119398-0012 MAMMOTH CAVE ISN'T A NATIONAL PARK
8334-119398-0013 IT WAS A STATE MATTER UNTIL THE GOVERNOR ASKED FOR FEDERAL TROOPS WHENEVER THE REGULARS GET INTO TROUBLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RATHER APT TO TAKE A HAND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT REGULARS HAD BEEN SENT THERE TELL ME ABOUT THE CASE WILL YOU COME ALONG
8334-119398-0014 DOCTOR BIRD SHOOK HIS HEAD SLOWLY I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW I CAN SPARE THE TIME CARNES HE SAID
8334-119398-0015 SIT DOWN CONFOUND YOU CRIED THE DOCTOR YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO TRY TO PULL THAT ON ME TELL ME YOUR CASE AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU WHETHER I'LL GO OR NOT I CAN'T SPARE THE TIME BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF IT SOUNDS INTERESTING ENOUGH
8334-119398-0016 ALL RIGHT DOCTOR HE SAID I'LL TAKE ENOUGH TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT EVEN IF YOU CAN'T GO DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
8334-119398-0017 START AT THE BEGINNING AND TELL ME THE WHOLE THING
8334-119398-0018 NO IT OR RATHER THEY FOR WHILE IT IS CALLED MAMMOTH CAVE IT IS REALLY A SERIES OF CAVES ARE LOCATED IN EDMONSON COUNTY IN CENTRAL KENTUCKY ON A SPUR RAILROAD FROM GLASGOW JUNCTION ON THE LOUISVILLE AND NASHVILLE RAILROAD
8334-119398-0019 THEY ARE NATURAL LIMESTONE CAVERNS WITH THE CUSTOMARY STALACTITE AND STALAGMITE FORMATION BUT ARE UNUSUALLY LARGE AND VERY BEAUTIFUL THE CAVES ARE QUITE EXTENSIVE AND THEY ARE ON DIFFERENT LEVELS SO THAT A GUIDE IS NECESSARY IF ONE WANTS TO ENTER THEM
8334-119398-0020 AND BE AT ALL SURE OF FINDING THE WAY OUT VISITORS ARE TAKEN OVER A REGULAR ROUTE
8334-119398-0021 ENTERED THE CAVE WITH A REGULAR GUIDE THE PARTY CONSISTED OF A MAN AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN
8334-119398-0022 THEY WENT QUITE A DISTANCE BACK INTO THE CAVES AND THEN AS THE MOTHER WAS FEELING TIRED SHE AND HER HUSBAND SAT DOWN INTENDING TO WAIT UNTIL THE GUIDE SHOWED THE CHILDREN SOME SIGHTS WHICH LAY JUST AHEAD AND THEN RETURN TO THEM THE GUIDE AND THE CHILDREN NEVER RETURNED
8334-119398-0023 WHAT HAPPENED NO ONE KNOWS ALL THAT IS KNOWN IS THE BARE FACT THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE A KIDNAPPING CASE APPARENTLY NOT IN THE LIGHT OF LATER HAPPENINGS
8334-119398-0024 AT ANY RATE THEY DIDN'T IMPRESS HER AT THE TIME WHEN HALF AN HOUR HAD PASSED THEY BEGAN TO FEEL ANXIOUS AND THE FATHER TOOK A TORCH AND STARTED OUT TO HUNT FOR THEM THE USUAL THING HAPPENED HE GOT LOST
8334-119398-0025 NOW THOROUGHLY ALARMED MADE HER WAY BY SOME UNCANNY SENSE OF DIRECTION TO THE ENTRANCE AND GAVE THE ALARM
8334-119398-0026 THE FATHER WAS SOON LOCATED NOT FAR FROM THE BEATEN TRAIL BUT DESPITE THREE DAYS OF CONSTANT SEARCH THE CHILDREN WERE NOT LOCATED THE ONLY TRACE OF THEM THAT WAS FOUND WAS A BRACELET WHICH THE MOTHER IDENTIFIED
8334-119398-0027 WHEN THE BRACELET WAS FOUND THE KIDNAPPING THEORY GAINED VOGUE FOR JOHN HARREL THE MISSING GUIDE KNEW THE CAVE WELL AND NATIVES OF THE VICINITY SCOUTED THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE LOST INSPIRED BY THE LARGE REWARD OFFERED BY THE FATHER
8334-119398-0028 FRESH PARTIES BEGAN TO EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN PORTIONS OF THE CAVE AND THEN CAME THE SECOND TRAGEDY TWO OF THE SEARCHERS FAILED TO RETURN THIS TIME THERE SEEMED TO BE LITTLE DOUBT OF VIOLENCE FOR SCREAMS AND A PISTOL SHOT WERE FAINTLY HEARD BY OTHER SEARCHERS
8334-119398-0029 TOGETHER WITH A PECULIAR SCREAMING HOWL AS IT WAS DESCRIBED BY THOSE WHO HEARD IT A SEARCH WAS AT ONCE MADE TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE BRACELET HAD BEEN PICKED UP
8334-119398-0030 THE SEARCHERS SAID THAT THE FLOOR APPEARED TO BE RATHER MORE MOIST AND SLIMY THAN USUAL BUT THAT WAS ALL
8334-119398-0031 THIS OBSERVATION WAS NOT CONFIRMED BY OTHERS WHO ARRIVED A FEW MOMENTS LATER WHAT HAPPENED NEXT THE GOVERNOR WAS APPEALED TO AND A COMPANY OF THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS SENT FROM LOUISVILLE TO MAMMOTH CAVE THEY TOOK UP CAMP AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE AND PREVENTED EVERYONE FROM ENTERING
8334-119398-0032 SOLDIERS ARMED WITH SERVICE RIFLES PENETRATED THE CAVERNS BUT FOUND NOTHING VISITORS WERE EXCLUDED AND THE GUARDSMEN ESTABLISHED REGULAR PATROLS AND SENTRY POSTS IN THE CAVE WITH THE RESULT THAT ONE NIGHT
8334-119398-0033 IT HAD NOT BEEN FIRED DOUBLE GUARDS WERE THEN POSTED AND NOTHING HAPPENED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND THEN ANOTHER SENTRY DISAPPEARED HIS COMPANION CAME RUSHING OUT OF THE CAVE SCREAMING
8334-119398-0034 HE FLASHED HIS ELECTRIC TORCH ALL AROUND
8334-119398-0035 HE SWEARS HOWEVER THAT HE HEARD A SLIPPING SLIDING NOISE APPROACHING HIM AND HE FELT THAT SOME ONE WAS LOOKING AT HIM
8334-119398-0036 HAD HE BEEN DRINKING NO IT WASN'T DELIRIUM EITHER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT A PATROL FOUND HIS GUN WHERE HE HAD THROWN IT BUT NO TRACE OF THE OTHER SENTRY
8334-119398-0037 A COMPANY OF INFANTRY WAS ORDERED DOWN FROM FORT THOMAS TO RELIEVE THE GUARDSMEN BUT THEY FARED WORSE THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS THEY LOST TWO MEN THE FIRST NIGHT OF THEIR GUARD THE REGULARS WEREN'T CAUGHT NAPPING FOR THE MAIN GUARD HEARD FIVE SHOTS FIRED
8334-119398-0038 THEY RUSHED A PATROL TO THE SCENE AND FOUND BOTH OF THE RIFLES WHICH HAD BEEN FIRED BUT THE MEN WERE GONE THE OFFICER OF THE DAY MADE A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE VICINITY AND FOUND SOME TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE SENTRIES HAD BEEN POSTED
8334-119398-0039 A CRACK IN THE WALL THROUGH WHICH THE BODY OF A MAN COULD BE FORCED THIS BODYCRACK HAD FRESH BLOOD ON EACH SIDE OF IT
8334-119398-0040 AND ENTERED HIMSELF THAT WAS LAST TUESDAY AND HE HAS NOT RETURNED WAS THERE ANY DISTURBANCE HEARD FROM THE CRACK NONE AT ALL
8334-119398-0041 A GUARD WAS POSTED WITH TWO MACHINE GUNS POINTED AT THE CRACK IN THE WALL AND A GUARD OF EIGHT MEN AND A SERGEANT STATIONED THERE LAST NIGHT ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK WHILE THE GUARD WERE SITTING AROUND THEIR GUNS A FAINT SMELL OF MUSK BECAME EVIDENT
8334-119398-0042 NO ONE PAID A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION TO IT BUT SUDDENLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON AT ALL ONE OF THE MEN ON GUARD WAS JERKED INTO THE AIR FEET UPWARDS HE GAVE A SCREAM OF FEAR AND AN UNEARTHLY SCREECH ANSWERED HIM THE GUARD
8334-119398-0043 ONE MAN STUCK BY HIS GUN AND POURED A STREAM OF BULLETS INTO THE CRACK THE RETREATING MEN COULD HEAR THE RATTLE OF THE GUN FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN THERE WAS A CHOKING SCREAM FOLLOWED BY SILENCE
8334-119398-0044 WHEN THE OFFICER OF THE DAY GOT BACK WITH A PATROL THERE WAS A HEAVY SMELL OF MUSK IN THE AIR AND A GOOD DEAL OF BLOOD WAS SPLASHED AROUND THE MACHINE GUNS WERE BOTH THERE ALTHOUGH ONE OF THEM WAS TWISTED UP UNTIL IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN THROUGH AN EXPLOSION
8334-119398-0045 THE OFFICER COMMANDING THE COMPANY INVESTIGATED THE PLACE ORDERED ALL MEN OUT OF THE CAVE AND COMMUNICATED WITH THE WAR DEPARTMENT
8334-119398-0046 THE CREASES ON DOCTOR BIRD'S HIGH FOREHEAD HAD GROWN DEEPER AND DEEPER AS CARNES HAD TOLD HIS STORY BUT NOW THEY SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
8334-119398-0047 WITH AN ADVENTURE LIKE THIS AHEAD OF YOU LEG IRONS AND HANDCUFFS WOULDN'T KEEP YOU AWAY FROM MAMMOTH CAVE
8334-119398-0048 THEY INTRODUCED THEMSELVES TO THE MAJOR COMMANDING THE GUARD BATTALION WHICH HAD BEEN ORDERED DOWN TO REINFORCE THE SINGLE COMPANY WHICH HAD BORNE THE FIRST BRUNT OF THE AFFAIR AND THEN INTERVIEWED THE GUARDS WHO HAD BEEN ROUTED BY THE UNSEEN HORROR WHICH WAS HAUNTING THE FAMOUS CAVE
8334-119398-0049 NOTHING WAS LEARNED WHICH DIFFERED IN ANY GREAT DEGREE FROM THE TALE WHICH CARNES HAD RELATED TO THE DOCTOR IN WASHINGTON
8334-119398-0050 FAILED TO ENTIRELY CORROBORATE THE SMELL OF MUSK WHICH HAD BEEN REPORTED BY THE OTHER OBSERVERS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MUSK BUT TO ME IT SMELLED DIFFERENTLY HE SAID WERE YOU EVER NEAR A RATTLESNAKE DEN IN THE WEST DOCTOR BIRD NODDED
8334-119398-0051 WELL THIS SMELL WAS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR ALTHOUGH NOT THE SAME BY ANY MANNER OF MEANS IT WAS MUSKY ALL RIGHT BUT IT WAS MORE SNAKE THAN MUSK TO ME
8334-119398-0052 NONE AT ALL THE MEN DESCRIBE SOME RATHER PECULIAR NOISES AND SERGEANT JERVIS IS AN OLD FILE AND PRETTY APT TO GET THINGS STRAIGHT BUT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE MEN WHO WERE IN TROUBLE
8334-119398-0053 I SAW A MAN CAUGHT BY A BOA IN SOUTH AMERICA ONCE AND THE NOISES HE MADE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN ALMOST THE SAME WORDS AS JERVIS USED THANKS LIEUTENANT REPLIED THE DOCTOR
8334-119398-0054 NOW I THINK THAT WE'LL GO INTO THE CAVE MY ORDERS ARE TO ALLOW NO ONE TO ENTER DOCTOR
8334-119398-0055 WHERE IS THAT LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY OF WAR CARNES PRODUCED THE DOCUMENT THE LIEUTENANT EXAMINED IT AND EXCUSED HIMSELF HE RETURNED IN A FEW MOMENTS WITH THE COMMANDING OFFICER IN THE FACE OF THAT LETTER DOCTOR BIRD SAID THE MAJOR
8334-119398-0056 I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE TO ALLOWING YOU TO ENTER THE CAVE BUT I WILL WARN YOU THAT IT IS AT YOUR OWN PERIL I'LL GIVE YOU AN ESCORT IF YOU WISH IF LIEUTENANT PEARCE WILL COME WITH ME AS A GUIDE
8334-119398-0057 THE LIEUTENANT PALED SLIGHTLY BUT THREW BACK HIS SHOULDERS DO YOU WISH TO START AT ONCE SIR HE ASKED IN A FEW MOMENTS
8334-119398-0058 IN THAT CASE BEFORE WE GO IN WE WANT TO PUT ON BASEBALL SHOES WITH CLEATS ON THEM SO THAT WE CAN RUN IF WE HAVE TO CAN YOU GET US ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN A FEW MOMENTS SIR
8334-119398-0059 IN THE MEANTIME MAY I LOOK AT THAT GUN THAT WAS FOUND THE BROWNING MACHINE GUN WAS LAID BEFORE THE DOCTOR HE LOOKED IT OVER CRITICALLY AND SNIFFED DELICATELY AT IT
8334-119398-0060 MOISTENED A PORTION OF THE WATER JACKET OF THE WEAPON AND THEN RUBBED THE MOISTENED PART BRISKLY WITH HIS HAND HE SNIFFED AGAIN HE LOOKED DISAPPOINTED AND AGAIN EXAMINED THE GUN CLOSELY CARNES HE SAID AT LENGTH
8334-119398-0061 NOTHING DOCTOR NEITHER DO I THERE ARE SOME MARKS HERE WHICH MIGHT QUITE CONCEIVABLY BE FINGER PRINTS OF A FORTY FOOT GIANT AND THOSE TWO PARALLEL GROOVES LOOK LIKE THE RESULT OF SEVERE SQUEEZING BUT THERE ARE NO TOOTH MARKS
8334-119398-0062 STRANGE THERE IS NO PERSISTENT ODOR ON THE GUN WHICH IS ALSO STRANGE WELL THERE'S NO USE IN THEORIZING WE ARE CONFRONTED BY A CONDITION AND NOT A THEORY
8334-119398-0063 DOCTOR BIRD LED THE WAY INTO THE CAVE CARNES AND THE LIEUTENANT FOLLOWING CLOSELY WITH ELECTRIC TORCHES IN EACH HAND DOCTOR BIRD CARRIED A PHOSPHORUS HAND GRENADE
8334-119398-0064 I'M GOING FIRST SAID THE DOCTOR FOLLOW ME AND INDICATE THE TURNS BY PRESSURE ON MY SHOULDER
8334-119398-0065 AND THE NOISE ECHOED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE WALLS DYING OUT IN LITTLE EERIE WHISPERS OF SOUND THAT MADE CARNES HAIR RISE EVER FORWARD THEY PRESSED THE LIEUTENANT GUIDING THE DOCTOR BY SILENT PRESSURE ON HIS SHOULDER
8334-119398-0066 AND CARNES FOLLOWING CLOSELY FOR HALF A MILE THEY WENT ON UNTIL A RESTRAINABLE PRESSURE BROUGHT THE DOCTOR TO A HALT THE LIEUTENANT POINTED SILENTLY TOWARD A CRACK IN THE WALL BEFORE THEM CARNES STARTED FORWARD TO EXAMINE IT
8334-119398-0067 BUT A WARNING GESTURE FROM THE DOCTOR STOPPED HIM SLOWLY AN INCH AT A TIME THE DOCTOR CREPT FORWARD HAND GRENADES IN READINESS PRESENTLY HE REACHED THE CRACK AND SHIFTING ONE OF THE GRENADES INTO HIS POCKET
8334-119398-0068 HE DREW FORTH AN ELECTRIC TORCH AND SENT A BEAM OF LIGHT THROUGH THE CRACK INTO THE DARK INTERIOR OF THE EARTH FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD THUS AND THEN SUDDENLY SNAPPED OFF HIS TORCH AND STRAIGHTENED UP IN AN ATTITUDE OF LISTENING
8334-119398-0069 THE STRAINING EARS OF CARNES AND LIEUTENANT PEARCE COULD HEAR A FAINT SLITHERING NOISE COMING TOWARD THEM
8334-119398-0070 BUT FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE CAVE SIMULTANEOUSLY A FAINT MUSKY REPTILIAN ODOR BECAME APPARENT RUN SHOUTED THE DOCTOR RUN LIKE HELL IT'S LOOSE IN THE CAVE
8334-119398-0071 DOCTOR BIRD PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT STRAINING HIS EARS AND THEN THREW A GRENADE A BLINDING FLASH CAME FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MISSILE STRUCK AND A WHITE CLOUD ROSE IN THE AIR THE DOCTOR TURNED AND FLED AFTER HIS COMPANIONS
8334-119398-0072 NOT FOR NOTHING HAD DOCTOR BIRD BEEN AN ATHLETE OF NOTE IN HIS COLLEGE DAYS DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF HIS COMPANIONS WHO WERE LITERALLY RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES HE SOON CAUGHT UP WITH THEM AS HE DID SO A WEIRD
8334-119398-0073 BLOOD CURDLING SCREECH ROSE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM HIGHER AND HIGHER IN PITCH THE NOTE ROSE UNTIL IT ENDED SUDDENLY IN A GURGLING GRUNT AS THOUGH THE BREATH WHICH UTTERED IT HAD BEEN SUDDENLY CUT OFF
8334-119398-0074 THE SLITHERING RUSTLING NOISE BECAME LOUDER ON THEIR TRAIL FASTER GASPED THE DOCTOR AS HE PUT HIS HAND ON CARNES SHOULDER AND PUSHED HIM FORWARD THE NOISE OF PURSUIT GAINED SLIGHTLY ON THEM AND A SOUND AS OF INTENSE BREATHING BECAME AUDIBLE
8334-119398-0075 DOCTOR BIRD PAUSED AND TURNED AND FACED THE ONCOMING HORROR HIS ELECTRIC TORCH REVEALED NOTHING BUT HE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN THREW HIS SECOND GRENADE KEENLY HE WATCHED ITS FLIGHT IT FLEW THROUGH THE AIR FOR THIRTY YARDS
8334-119398-0076 AND THEN STRUCK AN INVISIBLE OBSTRUCTION AND BOUNDED TOWARD THE GROUND
8334-119398-0077 AND IT ROSE IN THE AIR AS IT ROSE IT BURST WITH A SHARP REPORT AND A WILD SCREAM OF PAIN FILLED THE CAVERN WITH A DEAFENING ROAR THE DOCTOR FLED AGAIN AFTER HIS COMPANIONS BY THE TIME HE OVERTOOK THEM THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE LOOMED BEFORE THEM
8334-119398-0078 WITH SOBS OF RELIEF THEY
8334-119398-0079 THE GUARDS SPRANG FORWARD WITH RAISED RIFLES BUT DOCTOR BIRD WAVED THEM BACK THERE'S NOTHING AFTER US MEN HE PANTED
8334-119398-0080 AND IT MUST HAVE BURNED HIS FINGERS A LITTLE JUDGING FROM THE RACKET HE MADE AT ANY RATE IT STOPPED THE PURSUIT THE MAJOR HURRIED UP DID YOU SEE IT DOCTOR HE ASKED NO I DIDN'T NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN IT OR ANYTHING LIKE IT
8334-119398-0081 I HEARD IT AND FROM ITS VOICE I THINK IT HAS A BAD COLD
8334-119398-0082 I DIDN'T GET A GLIMPSE OF IT FOR GOD'S SAKE DOCTOR WHAT IS IT I CAN'T TELL YOU YET MAJOR SO FAR I CAN TELL IT IS SOMETHING NEW TO SCIENCE
8334-119398-0083 HOWEVER I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW IT TO YOU SHORTLY IS THERE A TELEGRAPH OFFICE HERE NO BUT WE HAVE A SIGNAL CORPS DETACHMENT WITH US AND THEY HAVE A PORTABLE RADIO SET WHICH WILL PUT US IN TOUCH WITH THE ARMY NET GOOD CAN YOU PLACE A TENT AT MY DISPOSAL CERTAINLY DOCTOR
8334-119398-0084 I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE BUREAU OF STANDARDS TO FORWARD ME SOME APPARATUS WHICH I NEED I'LL ATTEND TO IT DOCTOR HAVE YOU ANY SPECIAL ADVICE TO GIVE ME ABOUT THE GUARDING YES HAVE YOU OR CAN YOU GET ANY LIVE STOCK LIVE STOCK YES
8334-119398-0085 CATTLE PREFERRED ALTHOUGH HOGS OR SHEEP WILL DO AT A PINCH SHEEP WILL DO QUITE WELL I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO DOCTOR GET THEM BY ALL MEANS IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT PAYING FOR THEM
8334-119398-0086 TELL THEM TO BREAK AND RUN I HOPE IT WON'T COME OUT BUT I CAN'T TELL
8334-119398-0087 TWO HOURS LATER A SERIES OF HORRIBLE SCREAMS AND BELLOWINGS WERE HEARD IN THE CAVE FOLLOWING THEIR ORDERS THE SENTRIES ABANDONED THEIR POSTS AND SCATTERED BUT THE NOISE CAME NO NEARER THE MOUTH AND IN A FEW MINUTES SILENCE AGAIN REIGNED
8334-119398-0088 BUT YOU HAD BETTER HAVE A COUPLE MORE CATTLE DRIVEN IN IN THE MORNING
8334-119398-0089 DON'T BOTHER WITH MILITARY CHANNELS RADIO DIRECT TO THE ADJUTANT GENERAL QUOTING THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY AS AUTHORITY TELL HIM THAT IT'S A RUSH MATTER AND SIGN THE MESSAGE BIRD IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF GETTING YOUR TAIL TWISTED
8334-119398-0090 EACH TIME SEARCHING PARTIES FOUND THE CATTLE GONE IN THE MORNING A WEEK AFTER THE DOCTOR'S ARRIVAL A SPECIAL TRAIN CAME UP
8334-119398-0091 UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE DOCTOR THE CASES WERE UNPACKED AND THE APPARATUS PUT TOGETHER BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN COMPLETED
8334-119398-0092 THE FIRST APPARATUS WHICH WAS INSTALLED IN THE TANK CONSISTED OF AN ELECTRIC GENERATOR OF PECULIAR DESIGN WHICH WAS GEARED TO THE TANK MOTOR THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE THUS GENERATED WAS LED ACROSS A SPARK GAP WITH POINTS OF A METALLIC SUBSTANCE
8334-119398-0093 THE LIGHT PRODUCED WAS CONCENTRATED BY A SERIES OF PARABOLIC REFLECTORS DIRECTED AGAINST A LARGE QUARTZ PRISM AND THENCE THROUGH A LENS WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO THROW A SLIGHTLY DIVERGENT BEAM THIS APPARATUS DOCTOR BIRD EXPLAINED TO THE SIGNAL CORPS OFFICER WHO WAS AN INTERESTED OBSERVER
8334-119398-0094 HOWEVER SUCH POINTS COULD NOT BE USED FOR THE HANDLING OF A STEADY CURRENT BECAUSE OF LACK OF DURABILITY AND EASE OF FUSION
8334-119398-0095 THUS WE GET THE TRIPLE ADVANTAGES OF ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT PRODUCTION DURABILITY AND HIGH RESISTANCE THE SYSTEM OF REFLECTORS CATCHES ALL OF THE LIGHT THUS PRODUCED EXCEPT THE RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION WHICH GOES INITIALLY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
8334-119398-0096 AND DIRECTS IT ON THIS QUARTZ PRISM WHERE DUE TO THE REFRACTIVE POWERS OF THE PRISM THE LIGHT IS BROKEN UP INTO ITS COMPONENT PARTS THE INFRA RED RAYS AND THAT PORTION OF THE SPECTRUM WHICH LIES IN THE VISIBLE RANGE THAT IS FROM RED TO VIOLET INCLUSIVE
8334-119398-0097 ARE ABSORBED BY A BLACK BODY LEAVING ONLY THE ULTRA VIOLET PORTION FREE TO SEND A BEAM THROUGH THIS QUARTZ LENS I THOUGHT THAT A LENS WOULD ABSORB ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT OBJECTED THE SIGNAL OFFICER A LENS MADE OF GLASS WILL BUT THIS LENS IS MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL
8334-119398-0098 WHICH IS READILY PERMEABLE TO ULTRA VIOLET THE NET RESULT OF THIS APPARATUS IS THAT WE CAN DIRECT BEFORE US AS WE MOVE IN THE TANK A BEAM OF LIGHT WHICH IS COMPOSED SOLELY OF THE ULTRA VIOLET PORTION OF THE SPECTRUM IN OTHER WORDS AN INVISIBLE LIGHT
8334-119398-0099 YES THAT IS INVISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE THE EFFECT OF THIS BEAM OF ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT IN THE FORM OF SEVERE SUNBURN WOULD BE READILY APPARENT IF YOU EXPOSED YOUR SKIN TO IT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
8334-119398-0100 IT WOULD PRODUCE A SEVERE OPTHALMIA AND TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OF THE VISION SOMEWHAT THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS ARE OBSERVED IN SNOW BLINDNESS I SEE MAY I ASK WHAT IS THE OBJECT OF THE WHOLE THING SURELY
8334-119398-0101 BEFORE WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMBAT THIS PECULIAR VISITANT FROM ANOTHER WORLD IT IS NECESSARY THAT WE GAIN SOME IDEA OF THE SIZE AND APPEARANCE OF IT NOTHING OF THE SORT HAS BEFORE MADE ITS APPEARANCE SO FAR AS THE ANNALS OF SCIENCE GO
8334-119398-0102 AND SO I AM FORCED TO MAKE SOME RATHER WILD GUESSES AT THE NATURE OF THE ANIMAL YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THE PROPERTY OF PENETRATION POSSESSED BY ALL WAVES IS A FUNCTION OF THEIR FREQUENCY OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY OF THEIR WAVE LENGTH CERTAINLY
8334-119398-0103 THE LONGER RAYS OF VISIBLE LIGHT WILL NOT PENETRATE AS DEEPLY INTO A GIVEN SUBSTANCE AS THE SHORTER ULTRA VIOLET RAYS THIS VISITOR IS EVIDENTLY FROM SOME UNEXPLORED AND INDEED UNKNOWN CAVERN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH WHERE VISIBLE LIGHT HAS NEVER PENETRATED
8334-119398-0104 PARDON ME YOU UNDERSTAND OF COURSE WHAT COLOR IS WHEN SUNLIGHT WHICH IS A MIXTURE OF ALL COLORS FROM INFRA RED TO ULTRA VIOLET INCLUSIVE FALLS OH AN OBJECT CERTAIN RAYS ARE REFLECTED AND CERTAIN OTHERS ARE ABSORBED
8334-119398-0105 AND ALL OTHERS ABSORBED THE OBJECT APPEARS RED TO OUR EYES IF ALL THE RAYS ARE REFLECTED THE OBJECT APPEARS WHITE
8334-119398-0106 THE HUMAN EYE CANNOT DETECT ULTRA VIOLET SUPPOSE THEN THAT WE HAVE AN OBJECT EITHER ANIMATE OR INANIMATE THE SURFACE OF WHICH REFLECTS ONLY ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT WHAT WILL BE THE RESULT THE OBJECT WILL BE INVISIBLE
8334-119398-0107 I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE BLACK IF ALL THE RAYS EXCEPT THE ULTRA VIOLET WERE ABSORBED IT WOULD BUT MARK I DID NOT SAY THE OTHERS WERE ABSORBED ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH FLUORESCEIN NO I THINK YOU ARE
8334-119398-0108 IT IS THE DYE USED IN MAKING CHANGEABLE SILK IF WE FILL A GLASS CONTAINER WITH A FLUORESCEIN SOLUTION AND LOOK AT IT BY REFLECTED LIGHT IT APPEARS GREEN IF WE LOOK AT IT BY TRANSMITTED LIGHT THAT IS LIGHT WHICH HAS TRAVERSED THE SOLUTION
8334-119398-0109 IT APPEARS RED IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS A SUBSTANCE WHICH REFLECTS GREEN LIGHT
8334-119398-0110 IF MY THEORY IS CORRECT IS COMPOSED OF A SUBSTANCE WHICH ALLOWS FREE PASSAGE TO ALL OF THE VISIBLE LIGHT RAYS AND AT THE SAME TIME REFLECTS ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT DO I MAKE THIS CLEAR PERFECTLY VERY WELL THEN
8334-119398-0111 MY APPARATUS WILL PROJECT FORWARD A BEAM OF ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT WHICH WILL BE IN MUCH GREATER CONCENTRATION THAN EXISTS IN AN INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHT
8334-119398-0112 BUT WON'T YOUR LENS PREVENT THE ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT FROM REACHING YOUR PLATE
8334-119398-0113 I HAVE A CAMERA HERE EQUIPPED WITH A ROCK CRYSTAL LENS WHICH WILL ALLOW ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT TO PASS THROUGH IT PRACTICALLY UNHINDERED AND WITH VERY SLIGHT DISTORTION WHEN I ADD THAT I WILL HAVE MY CAMERA CHARGED WITH X RAY FILM
8334-119398-0114 A FILM WHICH IS PECULIARLY SENSITIVE TO THE SHORTER WAVE LENGTHS YOU WILL SEE THAT I WILL HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF SUCCESS IT SOUNDS LOGICAL WOULD YOU ALLOW ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR ATTEMPT I WILL BE GLAD OF YOUR COMPANY IF YOU CAN DRIVE A TANK
8334-119398-0115 I CAN DRIVE A TRACTOR IN THAT CASE YOU SHOULD MASTER THE TRICKS OF TANK DRIVING IN SHORT ORDER GET FAMILIAR WITH IT AND WE'LL APPOINT YOU AS DRIVER WE'LL BE READY TO GO IN TO NIGHT BUT I AM GOING TO WAIT A DAY
8334-119398-0116 OUR FRIEND WAS FED LAST NIGHT AND THERE IS LESS CHANCE HE'LL BE ABOUT THE EARLY PART OF THE NEXT EVENING WAS MARKED BY HOWLS AND SCREAMS COMING FROM THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE
8334-119398-0117 AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE NOISES WERE QUITE EVIDENTLY COMING NEARER AND THE SENTRIES WATCHED THE CAVE MOUTH NERVOUSLY READY TO BOLT AND SCATTER ACCORDING TO THEIR ORDERS AT THE FIRST ALARM ABOUT TWO A M THE DOCTOR AND CARNES CLIMBED INTO THE TANK BESIDE LIEUTENANT LEFFINGWELL
8334-119398-0118 AND THE MACHINE MOVED SLOWLY INTO THE CAVE A SEARCH LIGHT ON THE FRONT OF THE TANK LIGHTED THE WAY FOR THEM AND ATTACHED TO A FRAME WHICH HELD IT SOME DISTANCE AHEAD OF THEM WAS A LUCKLESS SHEEP
8334-119398-0119 AS SOON AS ANYTHING HAPPENS TO IT SHUT OFF THE SEARCH LIGHT AND LET ME TRY TO GET A PICTURE AS SOON AS I HAVE MADE MY EXPOSURES I'LL TELL YOU AND YOU CAN SNAP IT ON AGAIN
8334-119398-0120 FORWARD THE TANK CRAWLED
8334-119398-0121 EVEN AS HE SPOKE THE SHEEP WAS SUDDENLY LIFTED INTO THE AIR IT GAVE A FINAL BLEAT OF TERROR AND THEN ITS HEAD WAS TORN FROM ITS BODY QUICK CARNES SHOUTED THE DOCTOR THE SEARCH LIGHT WENT OUT
8334-119398-0122 AND CARNES AND THE LIEUTENANT COULD HEAR THE SLIDE OF THE ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT WHICH DOCTOR BIRD WAS MANIPULATING OPEN
8334-119398-0123 CARNES SNAPPED ON THE SEARCH LIGHT AND LIEUTENANT LEFFINGWELL SWUNG THE TANK AROUND AND HEADED FOR THE CAVE MOUTH FOR A FEW FEET THEIR PROGRESS WAS UNHINDERED AND THEN THE TANK CEASED ITS FORWARD MOTION
8334-119398-0124 ALTHOUGH THE MOTOR STILL ROARED AND THE TRACK SLID ON THE CAVE FLOOR CARNES WATCHED WITH HORROR AS ONE SIDE OF THE TANK BENT SLOWLY IN TOWARD HIM THERE WAS A RENDING SOUND AND A PORTION OF THE HEAVY STEEL FABRIC WAS TORN AWAY
8334-119398-0125 PRESENTLY HE STRAIGHTENED UP AND THREW A SMALL OBJECT INTO THE DARKNESS THERE WAS A FLASH OF LIGHT AND BITS OF FLAMING PHOSPHORUS FLEW IN EVERY DIRECTION THE ANCHOR WHICH HELD THE TANK WAS SUDDENLY LOOSED
8334-119398-0126 AND THE MACHINE CRAWLED FORWARD AT FULL SPEED WHILE A ROAR AS OF ESCAPING AIR MINGLED WITH A BELLOWING SHRIEK BURDENED THE SMOKE LADEN AIR FASTER CRIED THE DOCTOR AS HE THREW ANOTHER GRENADE
8334-119398-0127 LIEUTENANT LEFFINGWELL GOT THE LAST BIT OF SPEED POSSIBLE OUT OF THE TANK AND THEY REACHED THE CAVE MOUTH WITHOUT FURTHER MOLESTATION
8334-119398-0128 HE MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER SEVERELY BURNED THE OTHER DAY AND ONCE BURNED IS USUALLY TWICE SHY WHERE IS MAJOR BROWN THE COMMANDING OFFICER STEPPED FORWARD
8334-119398-0129 I WANT TO FILL THAT BRUTE UP AND KEEP HIM QUIET FOR A WHILE I'M GOING TO DEVELOPE MY FILMS LIEUTENANT LEFFINGWELL AND CARNES PEERED OVER THE DOCTOR'S SHOULDERS AS HE MANIPULATED HIS FILMS IN A DEVELOPING BATH
8334-119398-0130 BUT THE FORM WAS INDISTINCT DOCTOR BIRD DROPPED THE FILMS IN A FIXING TANK AND STRAIGHTENED UP WE HAVE SOMETHING GENTLEMEN HE ANNOUNCED BUT I CAN'T TELL YET HOW CLEAR IT IS IT WILL TAKE THOSE FILMS FIFTEEN MINUTES TO FIX AND THEN WE'LL KNOW
8334-119398-0131 IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE LIFTED THE FIRST FILM FROM THE TANK AND HELD IT TO THE LIGHT THE FILM SHOWED A BLANK WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF DISAPPOINTMENT HE LIFTED A SECOND AND THIRD FILM FROM THE TANK WITH THE SAME RESULT HE RAISED THE FOURTH ONE GOOD LORD
8334-119398-0132 GASPED CARNES IN THE PLATE COULD BE PLAINLY SEEN THE HIND QUARTERS OF THE SHEEP HELD IN THE GRASP OF SUCH A MONSTER AS EVEN THE DRUG LADEN BRAIN OF AN OPIUM SMOKER NEVER PICTURED
8334-119398-0133 JUDGING FROM THE SHEEP THE MONSTER STOOD ABOUT TWENTY FEET TALL AND ITS FRAME WAS SURMOUNTED BY A HEAD RESEMBLING AN OVERGROWN FROG ENORMOUS JAWS WERE OPENED TO SEIZE THE SHEEP
8334-119398-0134 BUT TO THE AMAZEMENT OF THE THREE OBSERVERS THE JAWS WERE ENTIRELY TOOTHLESS WHERE TEETH WERE TO BE EXPECTED LONG PARALLEL RIDGES OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE BARE BONE APPEARED WITHOUT EVEN A RUDIMENTARY SEGREGATION INTO TEETH
8334-119398-0135 ENDING IN FEET WITH THREE LONG TOES ARMED WITH VICIOUS CLAWS THE CROWNING HORROR OF THE CREATURE WAS ITS FORELEGS THERE WERE OF ENORMOUS LENGTH THIN AND ATTENUATED LOOKING
8334-119398-0136 AND ENDED IN HUGE MISSHAPEN HANDS KNOBBY AND BLOTCHED WHICH GRASPED THE SHEEP IN THE SAME MANNER AS HUMAN HANDS THE EYES WERE AS LARGE AS DINNER PLATES
8334-119398-0137 AND THEY WERE GLARING AT THE CAMERA WITH AN EXPRESSION OF FIENDISH MALEVOLENCE WHICH MADE CARNES SHUDDER
8334-119398-0138 DOCTOR BIRD RUBBED HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY IT'S NOT AN AMPHIBIAN HE MUTTERED
