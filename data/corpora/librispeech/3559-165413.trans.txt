3559-165413-0000 ON THE OUTWARD PASSAGE THEY ENCOUNTERED A HEAVY GALE OFF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WHICH SPRUNG THE MAINMAST AND OTHERWISE INJURED THE SHIP
3559-165413-0001 A QUARREL HAVING TAKEN PLACE ON THE PASSAGE OUT BETWEEN LAFITTE AND THE CAPTAIN HE ABANDONED THE SHIP AND REFUSED TO CONTINUE THE VOYAGE SEVERAL PRIVATEERS WERE AT THIS TIME FITTING OUT AT THIS ISLAND AND LAFITTE WAS APPOINTED CAPTAIN OF ONE OF THESE VESSELS
3559-165413-0002 AFTER A CRUISE DURING WHICH HE ROBBED THE VESSELS OF OTHER NATIONS BESIDES THOSE OF ENGLAND AND THUS COMMITTING PIRACY
3559-165413-0003 BUT BEING CHASED BY AN ENGLISH FRIGATE AS FAR NORTH AS THE EQUATOR HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A VERY AWKWARD CONDITION NOT HAVING PROVISIONS ENOUGH ON BOARD HIS SHIP TO CARRY HIM BACK TO THE FRENCH COLONY HE THEREFORE CONCEIVED THE BOLD PROJECT OF PROCEEDING TO THE BAY OF BENGAL
3559-165413-0004 IN ORDER TO GET PROVISIONS FROM ON BOARD SOME ENGLISH SHIPS IN HIS SHIP OF TWO HUNDRED TONS WITH ONLY TWO GUNS AND TWENTY SIX MEN HE ATTACKED AND TOOK AN ENGLISH ARMED SCHOONER WITH A NUMEROUS CREW AFTER PUTTING NINETEEN OF HIS OWN CREW ON BOARD THE SCHOONER
3559-165413-0005 HE TOOK THE COMMAND OF HER AND PROCEEDED TO CRUISE UPON THE COAST OF BENGAL HE THERE FELL IN WITH THE PAGODA A VESSEL BELONGING TO THE ENGLISH EAST INDIA COMPANY ARMED WITH TWENTY SIX TWELVE POUNDERS AND MANNED WITH ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN
3559-165413-0006 EXPECTING THAT THE ENEMY WOULD TAKE HIM FOR A PILOT OF THE GANGES HE MANOEUVRED ACCORDINGLY THE PAGODA MANIFESTED NO SUSPICIONS WHEREUPON HE SUDDENLY DARTED WITH HIS BRAVE FOLLOWERS UPON HER DECKS OVERTURNED ALL WHO OPPOSED THEM AND SPEEDILY TOOK THE SHIP
3559-165413-0007 AFTER A VERY SUCCESSFUL CRUISE
3559-165413-0008 LAFITTE FELL IN WITH THE QUEEN EAST INDIAMAN
3559-165413-0009 HE CONCEIVED THE BOLD PROJECT OF GETTING POSSESSION OF HER
3559-165413-0010 BUT THE DIFFICULTY AND DANGER FAR FROM DISCOURAGING THIS INTREPID SAILOR ACTED AS AN ADDITIONAL SPUR TO HIS BRILLIANT VALOR AFTER ELECTRIFYING HIS CREW WITH A FEW WORDS OF HOPE AND ARDOR
3559-165413-0011 IN THIS POSITION HE RECEIVED A BROADSIDE WHEN CLOSE TOO BUT HE EXPECTED THIS AND MADE HIS MEN LAY FLAT UPON THE DECK AFTER THE FIRST FIRE THEY ALL ROSE AND FROM THE YARDS AND TOPS
3559-165413-0012 THIS SUDDEN AND UNFORESEEN ATTACK CAUSED A GREAT HAVOC IN AN INSTANT DEATH AND TERROR MADE THEM ABANDON A PART OF THE VESSEL NEAR THE MIZEN MAST LAFITTE WHO OBSERVED EVERY THING
3559-165413-0013 SEIZED THE DECISIVE MOMENT BEAT TO ARMS AND FORTY OF HIS CREW PREPARED TO BOARD WITH PISTOLS IN THEIR HANDS AND DAGGERS HELD BETWEEN THEIR TEETH AS SOON AS THEY GOT ON DECK THEY RUSHED UPON THE AFFRIGHTED CROWD WHO RETREATED TO THE STEERAGE AND ENDEAVORED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THERE
3559-165413-0014 LAFITTE THEREUPON ORDERED A SECOND DIVISION TO BOARD WHICH HE HEADED HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN OF THE INDIAMAN WAS KILLED AND ALL WERE SWEPT AWAY IN A MOMENT LAFITTE CAUSED A GUN TO BE LOADED WITH GRAPE WHICH HE POINTED TOWARDS THE PLACE WHERE THE CROWD WAS ASSEMBLED
3559-165413-0015 MOUNTING TWENTY GUNS AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN AND SAILED FOR GAUDALOUPE AMONGST THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS HE MADE SEVERAL VALUABLE PRIZES BUT DURING HIS ABSENCE ON A CRUISE THE ISLAND HAVING BEEN TAKEN BY THE BRITISH

3559-165413-0032 AT NINE O'CLOCK A M THE CHASE FIRED UPON THE CAROLINA WHICH WAS RETURNED EACH VESSEL CONTINUED FIRING DURING THE CHASE WHEN THEIR LONG GUNS COULD REACH
3559-165413-0033 AT TEN O'CLOCK THE CHASE GROUNDED OUTSIDE OF THE BAR AT WHICH TIME THE CAROLINA WAS FROM THE SHOALNESS OF THE WATER OBLIGED TO HAUL HER WIND OFF SHORE AND GIVE UP THE CHASE OPENED A FIRE UPON THE CHASE ACROSS THE ISLAND FROM THE GUN VESSELS

3559-165413-0037 WHEN TWO PRIVATEERS BEING AT ANCHOR OFF CAT ISLAND A BRITISH SLOOP OF WAR ANCHORED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE PASS AND SENT HER BOATS TO ENDEAVOR TO TAKE THE PRIVATEERS BUT THEY WERE REPULSED WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS
3559-165413-0038 VENTURING SO FAR THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM THE PINNACE SENT FROM THE BRIG AND MAKING TOWARDS THE SHORE BEARING BRITISH COLORS AND A FLAG OF TRUCE IN THIS PINNACE WERE TWO NAVAL OFFICERS ONE WAS CAPTAIN LOCKYER COMMANDER OF THE BRIG
3559-165413-0039 REQUESTING HIM TO TAKE PARTICULAR CARE OF IT AND TO DELIVER IT INTO MISTER LAFITTE'S HANDS
3559-165413-0040 AND AS SOON AS THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO BE IN HIS POWER HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN RECOMMENDING TO THEM AT THE SAME TIME TO CONCEAL THE BUSINESS ON WHICH THEY HAD COME UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED PERSONS LINED THE SHORE AND IT WAS A GENERAL CRY AMONGST THE CREWS OF THE PRIVATEERS AT GRAND TERRE
3559-165413-0041 THAT THOSE BRITISH OFFICERS SHOULD BE MADE PRISONERS AND SENT TO NEW ORLEANS AS SPIES IT WAS WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY THAT LAFITTE DISSUADED THE MULTITUDE FROM THIS INTENT AND LED THE OFFICERS IN SAFETY TO HIS DWELLING HE THOUGHT VERY PRUDENTLY
3559-165413-0042 THAT THE PAPERS CONTAINED IN THE PACKET MIGHT BE OF IMPORTANCE TOWARDS THE SAFETY OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT THE OFFICERS IF WELL WATCHED COULD OBTAIN NO INTELLIGENCE THAT MIGHT TURN TO THE DETRIMENT OF LOUISIANA HE NOW EXAMINED THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET
3559-165413-0043 A LETTER FROM THE SAME TO MISTER LAFITTE THE COMMANDER OF BARRATARIA AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE HONORABLE W H PERCY CAPTAIN OF THE SLOOP OF WAR HERMES DIRECTED TO LAFITTE
3559-165413-0044 AND PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENTER INTO THE SERVICE OF HIS BRITTANIC MAJESTY WITH THE RANK OF POST CAPTAIN AND TO RECEIVE THE COMMAND OF A FORTY FOUR GUN FRIGATE ALSO ALL THOSE UNDER HIS COMMAND OR OVER WHOM HE HAD SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE

3559-165413-0046 CAPTAIN LOCKYER OBSERVED TO HIM THAT NO REFLECTION COULD BE NECESSARY RESPECTING PROPOSALS THAT OBVIOUSLY PRECLUDED HESITATION AS HE WAS A FRENCHMAN AND PROSCRIBED BY THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT BUT TO ALL HIS SPLENDID PROMISES AND DARING INSINUATIONS
3559-165413-0047 LAFITTE REPLIED THAT IN A FEW DAYS HE WOULD GIVE A FINAL ANSWER HIS OBJECT IN THIS PROCRASTINATION BEING TO GAIN TIME TO INFORM THE OFFICERS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT OF THIS NEFARIOUS PROJECT
3559-165413-0048 THE PERSONS WHO HAD PROPOSED TO SEND THE BRITISH OFFICERS PRISONERS TO NEW ORLEANS WENT AND SEIZED THEM IN HIS ABSENCE AND CONFINED BOTH THEM AND THE CREW OF THE PINNACE IN A SECURE PLACE LEAVING A GUARD AT THE DOOR
3559-165413-0049 WITH THIS VIEW HE REPRESENTED TO THE LATTER THAT BESIDES THE INFAMY THAT WOULD ATTACH TO THEM IF THEY TREATED AS PRISONERS PEOPLE WHO HAD COME WITH A FLAG OF TRUCE THEY WOULD LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY OF DISCOVERING THE PROJECTS OF THE BRITISH AGAINST LOUISIANA
3559-165413-0050 EARLY THE NEXT MORNING LAFITTE CAUSED THEM TO BE RELEASED FROM THEIR CONFINEMENT AND SAW THEM SAFE ON BOARD THEIR PINNACE APOLOGIZING THE DETENTION HE NOW WROTE TO CAPTAIN LOCKYER THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO CAPTAIN LOCKYER
3559-165413-0051 BARRATARIA FOURTH SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN SIR THE CONFUSION WHICH PREVAILED IN OUR CAMP YESTERDAY AND THIS MORNING AND OF WHICH YOU HAVE A COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE HAS PREVENTED ME FROM ANSWERING IN A PRECISE MANNER TO THE OBJECT OF YOUR MISSION

3559-165413-0061 AND MY VESSELS ARE PERFECTLY REGULAR IN THAT RESPECT IF I COULD HAVE BROUGHT MY LAWFUL PRIZES INTO THE PORTS OF THIS STATE I SHOULD NOT HAVE EMPLOYED THE ILLICIT MEANS THAT HAVE CAUSED ME TO BE PROSCRIBED

3559-165413-0067 HIS SHIP APPEARED AGAIN ON THE COAST WITH TWO OTHERS AND CONTINUED STANDING OFF AND ON BEFORE THE PASS FOR SEVERAL DAYS BUT HE PRETENDED NOT TO PERCEIVE THE RETURN OF THE SLOOP OF WAR WHO TIRED OF WAITING TO NO PURPOSE PUT OUT TO SEA AND DISAPPEARED

3559-165413-0072 THESE GENERAL ORDERS WERE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF LAFITTE
3559-165413-0073 MOST OF WHOM READILY EMBRACED THE CONDITIONS OF PARDON THEY HELD OUT IN A FEW DAYS MANY BRAVE MEN AND SKILLFUL ARTILLERISTS WHOSE SERVICES CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO THE SAFETY OF THE INVADED STATE FLOCKED TO THE STANDARD OF THE UNITED STATES AND BY THEIR CONDUCT
3559-165413-0074 RECEIVED THE HIGHEST APPROBATION OF GENERAL JACKSON BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION AMONG THE MANY EVILS PRODUCED BY THE WARS
3559-165413-0075 WHICH WITH LITTLE INTERMISSION HAVE AFFLICTED EUROPE AND EXTENDED THEIR RAVAGES INTO OTHER QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE FOR A PERIOD EXCEEDING TWENTY YEARS THE DISPERSION OF A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE INHABITANTS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN SORROW AND IN WANT
3559-165413-0076 HAS NOT BEEN THE LEAST INJURIOUS TO HUMAN HAPPINESS NOR THE LEAST SEVERE IN THE TRIAL OF HUMAN VIRTUE IT HAD BEEN LONG ASCERTAINED THAT MANY FOREIGNERS FLYING FROM THE DANGERS OF THEIR OWN HOME
3559-165413-0077 THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAUSED THE ESTABLISHMENT TO BE BROKEN UP AND DESTROYED AND HAVING OBTAINED THE MEANS OF DESIGNATING THE OFFENDERS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION IT ONLY REMAINED TO ANSWER THE DEMANDS OF JUSTICE BY INFLICTING AN EXEMPLARY PUNISHMENT
3559-165413-0078 BUT IT HAS SINCE BEEN REPRESENTED THAT THE OFFENDERS HAVE MANIFESTED A SINCERE PENITENCE THAT THEY HAVE ABANDONED THE PROSECUTION OF THE WORST CAUSE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE BEST AND PARTICULARLY THAT THEY HAVE EXHIBITED IN THE DEFENCE OF NEW ORLEANS
3559-165413-0079 UNEQUIVOCAL TRAITS OF COURAGE AND FIDELITY OFFENDERS WHO HAVE REFUSED TO BECOME THE ASSOCIATES OF THE ENEMY IN THE WAR UPON THE MOST SEDUCING TERMS OF INVITATION AND WHO HAVE AIDED TO REPEL HIS HOSTILE INVASION OF THE TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES
3559-165413-0080 CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED AS OBJECTS OF PUNISHMENT BUT AS OBJECTS OF A GENEROUS FORGIVENESS IT HAS THEREFORE BEEN SEEN WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THAT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA EARNESTLY RECOMMEND THOSE OFFENDERS
3559-165413-0081 TO THE BENEFIT OF A FULL PARDON AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION AS WELL AS IN CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE OTHER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE CASE I JAMES MADISON PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DO ISSUE THIS PROCLAMATION

3559-165413-0089 AND THE CHEERS OF THE BRITISH SOLDIERS ADVANCING TO THE ATTACK THE AMERICANS BEHIND THE BREASTWORK AWAITED IN CALM INTREPIDITY THEIR APPROACH THE ENEMY ADVANCED IN CLOSE COLUMN OF SIXTY MEN IN FRONT SHOULDERING THEIR MUSKETS
3559-165413-0090 A STORM OF ROCKETS PRECEDED THEM AND AN INCESSANT FIRE OPENED FROM THE BATTERY WHICH COMMANDED THE ADVANCED COLUMN
3559-165413-0091 THE MUSKETRY AND RIFLES FROM THE KENTUCKIANS AND TENNESSEANS JOINED THE FIRE OF THE ARTILLERY AND IN A FEW MOMENTS WAS HEARD ALONG THE LINE A CEASELESS ROLLING FIRE WHOSE TREMENDOUS NOISE RESEMBLED THE CONTINUED REVERBERATION OF THUNDER
3559-165413-0092 ONE OF THESE GUNS A TWENTY FOUR POUNDER PLACED UPON THE BREASTWORK IN THE THIRD EMBRASURE FROM THE RIVER DREW FROM THE FATAL SKILL AND ACTIVITY WITH WHICH IT WAS MANAGED EVEN IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE THE ADMIRATION OF BOTH AMERICANS AND BRITISH
3559-165413-0093 AND BECAME ONE OF THE POINTS MOST DREADED BY THE ADVANCING FOE HERE WAS STATIONED LAFITTE AND HIS LIEUTENANT DOMINIQUE AND A LARGE BAND OF HIS MEN WHO DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF THE BATTLE FOUGHT WITH UNPARALLELED BRAVERY
3559-165413-0094 THE BRITISH ALREADY HAD BEEN TWICE DRIVEN BACK IN THE UTMOST CONFUSION WITH THE LOSS OF THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND TWO GENERAL OFFICERS TWO OTHER BATTERIES WERE MANNED BY THE BARRATARIANS WHO SERVED THEIR PIECES WITH THE STEADINESS AND PRECISION OF VETERAN GUNNERS
3559-165413-0095 IN THE FIRST ATTACK OF THE ENEMY A COLUMN PUSHED FORWARD BETWEEN THE LEVEE AND RIVER AND SO PRECIPITATE WAS THEIR CHARGE THAT THE OUTPOSTS WERE FORCED TO RETIRE CLOSELY PRESSED BY THE ENEMY BEFORE THE BATTERIES COULD MEET THE CHARGE CLEARING THE DITCH
3559-165413-0096 THEY GAINED THE REDOUBT THROUGH THE EMBRASURES LEAPING OVER THE PARAPET AND OVERWHELMING BY THEIR SUPERIOR FORCE THE SMALL PARTY STATIONED THERE LAFITTE WHO WAS COMMANDING IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS OFFICERS AT ONE OF THE GUNS NO SOONER SAW THE BOLD MOVEMENT OF THE ENEMY
3559-165413-0097 THAN CALLING A FEW OF HIS BEST MEN BY HIS SIDE HE SPRUNG FORWARD TO THE POINT OF DANGER AND CLEARING THE BREASTWORK OF THE ENTRENCHMENTS LEAPED CUTLASS IN HAND INTO THE MIDST OF THE ENEMY FOLLOWED BY A SCORE OF HIS MEN WHO IN MANY A HARD FOUGHT BATTLE UPON HIS OWN DECK
3559-165413-0098 HAD BEEN WELL TRIED ASTONISHED AT THE INTREPIDITY WHICH COULD LEAD MEN TO LEAVE THEIR ENTRENCHMENTS AND MEET THEM HAND TO HAND AND PRESSED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF THE CHARGE WHICH WAS MADE WITH THE RECKLESSNESS SKILL AND RAPIDITY OF PRACTISED BOARDERS BOUNDING UPON THE DECK OF AN ENEMY'S VESSEL
3559-165413-0099 THEY BEGAN TO GIVE WAY WHILE ONE AFTER ANOTHER TWO BRITISH OFFICERS FELL BEFORE THE CUTLASS OF THE PIRATE AS THEY WERE BRAVELY ENCOURAGING THEIR MEN ALL THE ENERGIES OF THE BRITISH WERE NOW CONCENTRATED TO SCALE THE BREASTWORK WHICH ONE DARING OFFICER HAD ALREADY MOUNTED
3559-165413-0100 WHILE LAFITTE AND HIS FOLLOWERS SECONDING A GALLANT BAND OF VOLUNTEER RIFLEMEN FORMED A PHALANX WHICH THEY IN VAIN ASSAYED TO PENETRATE THE BRITISH FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE THE CITY AND THE HAVOC IN THEIR RANKS BEING DREADFUL MADE A PRECIPITATE RETREAT
3559-165413-0101 GENERAL JACKSON IN HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE SECRETARY OF WAR DID NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE CONDUCT OF THE CORSAIRS OF BARRATARIA WHO WERE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN EMPLOYED IN THE ARTILLERY SERVICE
3559-165413-0102 IN THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN THEY PROVED IN AN UNEQUIVOCAL MANNER THAT THEY HAD BEEN MISJUDGED BY THE ENEMY WHO A SHORT TIME PREVIOUS TO THE INVASION OF LOUISIANA HAD HOPED TO ENLIST THEM IN HIS CAUSE MANY OF THEM WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED IN THE DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY
3559-165413-0103 THEIR ZEAL THEIR COURAGE AND THEIR SKILL WERE REMARKED BY THE WHOLE ARMY WHO COULD NO LONGER CONSIDER SUCH BRAVE MEN AS CRIMINALS IN A FEW DAYS PEACE WAS DECLARED BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES
3559-165413-0104 THE PIRATICAL ESTABLISHMENT OF BARRATARIA HAVING BEEN BROKEN UP AND LAFITTE NOT BEING CONTENT WITH LEADING AN HONEST PEACEFUL LIFE PROCURED SOME FAST SAILING VESSELS AND WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF HIS FOLLOWERS PROCEEDED TO GALVEZTON BAY IN TEXAS
