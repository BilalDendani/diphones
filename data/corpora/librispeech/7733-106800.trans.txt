7733-106800-0000 ROUNDING UP INDIANS IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN GENERAL SHERIDAN ORGANIZED AN EXPEDITION TO OPERATE AGAINST THE INDIANS WHO INFESTED THE REPUBLICAN RIVER REGION CODY SAID HE
7733-106800-0001 I HAVE DECIDED TO APPOINT YOU AS GUIDE AND CHIEF OF SCOUTS WITH THE COMMAND HOW DOES THAT SUIT YOU FIRST RATE GENERAL AND THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR I REPLIED AS GRACEFULLY AS I KNEW HOW
7733-106800-0002 THE DOG SOLDIER INDIANS WERE A BAND OF CHEYENNES AND UNRULY TURBULENT MEMBERS OF OTHER TRIBES WHO WOULD NOT ENTER INTO ANY TREATY OR KEEP A TREATY IF THEY MADE ONE AND WHO HAD ALWAYS REFUSED TO GO UPON A RESERVATION
7733-106800-0003 THEY WERE A WARLIKE BODY OF WELL BUILT DARING AND RESTLESS BRAVES AND WERE DETERMINED TO HOLD POSSESSION OF THE COUNTRY IN THE VICINITY OF THE REPUBLICAN AND SOLOMON RIVERS THEY WERE CALLED DOG SOLDIERS BECAUSE THEY WERE PRINCIPALLY CHEYENNES
7733-106800-0004 GENERAL SHERIDAN BEING ANXIOUS TO PUNISH THE INDIANS WHO HAD LATELY FOUGHT GENERAL FORSYTH DID NOT GIVE THE REGIMENT MUCH OF A REST AND ACCORDINGLY ON THE FIFTH OF OCTOBER IT BEGAN ITS MARCH FOR THE BEAVER CREEK COUNTRY THE FIRST NIGHT WE CAMPED ON THE SOUTH FORK OF BIG CREEK
7733-106800-0005 FOUR MILES WEST OF HAYS CITY BY THIS TIME I HAD BECOME PRETTY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH MAJOR BROWN AND CAPTAIN SWEETMAN WHO INVITED ME TO MESS WITH THEM ON THIS EXPEDITION AND A JOLLY MESS WE HAD THERE WERE OTHER SCOUTS IN THE COMMAND BESIDES MYSELF
7733-106800-0006 AND I PARTICULARLY REMEMBER TOM RENAHAN HANK FIELDS AND A CHARACTER CALLED NOSEY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LONG NOSE THE NEXT DAY WE MARCHED THIRTY MILES AND LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WE CAME INTO CAMP ON THE SOUTH FORK OF THE SOLOMON
7733-106800-0007 AT THIS ENCAMPMENT COLONEL ROYAL ASKED ME TO GO OUT AND KILL SOME BUFFALOES FOR THE BOYS ALL RIGHT COLONEL SEND ALONG A WAGON OR TWO TO BRING IN THE MEAT I SAID I AM NOT IN THE HABIT OF SENDING OUT MY WAGONS UNTIL I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE HAULED IN
7733-106800-0008 KILL YOUR BUFFALOES FIRST AND THEN I'LL SEND OUT THE WAGONS WAS THE COLONEL'S REPLY I SAID NO MORE BUT WENT OUT ON A HUNT AND AFTER A SHORT ABSENCE RETURNED AND ASKED THE COLONEL TO SEND OUT HIS WAGONS OVER THE HILL FOR THE HALF DOZEN BUFFALOES I HAD KILLED
7733-106800-0009 THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON HE AGAIN REQUESTED ME TO GO OUT AND GET SOME FRESH BUFFALO MEAT I DIDN'T ASK HIM FOR ANY WAGONS THIS TIME BUT RODE OUT SOME DISTANCE AND COMING UP WITH A SMALL HERD I MANAGED TO GET SEVEN OF THEM HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE ENCAMPMENT
7733-106800-0010 AND INSTEAD OF SHOOTING THEM JUST THEN I RAN THEM AT FULL SPEED RIGHT INTO THE CAMP AND THEN KILLED THEM ALL ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN RAPID SUCCESSION COLONEL ROYAL WITNESSED THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WHICH PUZZLED HIM SOMEWHAT AS HE COULD SEE NO REASON WHY I HAD NOT KILLED THEM ON THE PRAIRIE
7733-106800-0011 HE CAME UP RATHER ANGRILY AND DEMANDED AN EXPLANATION I CAN'T ALLOW ANY SUCH BUSINESS AS THIS CODY SAID HE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IT I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ASKING FOR ANY WAGONS THIS TIME COLONEL SO I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE THE BUFFALOES FURNISH THEIR OWN TRANSPORTATION
7733-106800-0012 WAS MY REPLY THE COLONEL SAW THE POINT IN A MOMENT AND HAD NO MORE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT NO INDIANS HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE VICINITY DURING THE DAY AND COLONEL ROYAL HAVING CAREFULLY POSTED HIS PICKETS SUPPOSED EVERYTHING WAS SERENE FOR THE NIGHT
7733-106800-0013 BUT BEFORE MORNING WE WERE AROUSED FROM OUR SLUMBERS BY HEARING SHOTS FIRED AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD ONE OF THE MOUNTED PICKETS CAME GALLOPING INTO CAMP SAYING THAT THERE WERE INDIANS CLOSE AT HAND THE COMPANIES ALL FELL INTO LINE
7733-106800-0014 AND WERE SOON PREPARED AND ANXIOUS TO GIVE THE REDSKINS BATTLE BUT AS THE MEN WERE YET NEW IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY A GREAT MANY OF THEM WERE CONSIDERABLY EXCITED NO INDIANS HOWEVER MADE THEIR APPEARANCE
7733-106800-0015 AND UPON GOING TO THE PICKET POST WHERE THE PICKET SAID HE HAD SEEN THEM NONE COULD BE FOUND NOR COULD ANY TRACES OF THEM BE DISCOVERED THE SENTINEL WHO WAS AN IRISHMAN INSISTED THAT THERE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN REDSKINS THERE BUT YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN
7733-106800-0016 AS SHURE EZ ME NAME'S PAT MALONEY ONE OF THEM REDSKINS HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A CLUB SO HE DID SAID PAT AND SO WHEN MORNING CAME THE MYSTERY WAS FURTHER INVESTIGATED AND WAS EASILY SOLVED ELK TRACKS WERE FOUND IN THE VICINITY
7733-106800-0017 AND IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A HERD OF ELKS THAT HAD FRIGHTENED PAT AS HE HAD TURNED TO RUN HE HAD GONE UNDER A LIMB OF A TREE AGAINST WHICH HE HIT HIS HEAD
7733-106800-0018 A THREE DAYS UNINTERESTING MARCH BROUGHT US TO BEAVER CREEK WHERE WE WERE CAMPED AND FROM WHICH POINT SCOUTING PARTIES WERE SENT OUT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS NONE OF THESE HOWEVER DISCOVERING INDIANS THEY ALL RETURNED TO CAMP ABOUT THE SAME TIME
7733-106800-0019 IT HAVING BEEN ATTACKED A FEW HOURS PREVIOUSLY BY A PARTY OF INDIANS WHO HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING TWO MEN AND IN MAKING OFF WITH SIXTY HORSES BELONGING TO COMPANY H THAT EVENING THE COMMAND STARTED ON THE TRAIL OF THESE INDIAN HORSE THIEVES
7733-106800-0020 MAJOR BROWN WITH TWO COMPANIES AND THREE DAYS RATIONS PUSHING AHEAD IN ADVANCE OF THE MAIN COMMAND BEING UNSUCCESSFUL HOWEVER IN OVERTAKING THE INDIANS AND GETTING NEARLY OUT OF PROVISIONS IT BEING OUR EIGHTEENTH DAY OUT
7733-106800-0021 THE ENTIRE COMMAND MARCHED TOWARD THE NEAREST RAILWAY POINT AND CAMPED ON THE SALINE RIVER DISTANT THREE MILES FROM BUFFALO TANK WHILE WAITING FOR SUPPLIES WE RECEIVED A NEW COMMANDING OFFICER BREVET MAJOR GENERAL E A CARR
7733-106800-0022 HE BROUGHT WITH HIM THE CELEBRATED FORSYTH SCOUTS WHO WERE COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT PEPOON A REGULAR ARMY OFFICER THE NEXT MORNING AT AN EARLY HOUR THE COMMAND STARTED OUT ON A HUNT FOR INDIANS
7733-106800-0023 GENERAL CARR HAVING A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHERE HE WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO FIND THEM DIRECTED ME TO GUIDE THEM BY THE NEAREST ROUTE TO ELEPHANT ROCK ON BEAVER CREEK UPON ARRIVING AT THE SOUTH FORK OF THE BEAVER ON THE SECOND DAY'S MARCH
7733-106800-0024 WE DISCOVERED A LARGE FRESH INDIAN TRAIL WHICH WE HURRIEDLY FOLLOWED FOR A DISTANCE OF EIGHT MILES WHEN SUDDENLY WE SAW ON THE BLUFFS AHEAD OF US QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIANS GENERAL CARR ORDERED LIEUTENANT PEPOON'S SCOUTS AND COMPANY M TO THE FRONT
7733-106800-0025 THIS COMPANY WAS COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT SCHINOSKY A FRENCHMAN BY BIRTH AND RECKLESS BY NATURE HAVING ADVANCED HIS COMPANY NEARLY A MILE AHEAD OF THE MAIN COMMAND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED INDIANS SUDDENLY CHARGED DOWN UPON HIM AND GAVE HIM A LIVELY LITTLE FIGHT
7733-106800-0026 UNTIL HE WAS SUPPORTED BY OUR FULL FORCE THE INDIANS KEPT INCREASING IN NUMBERS ALL THE WHILE UNTIL IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT WE WERE FIGHTING FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND OF THEM THE ENGAGEMENT BECAME QUITE GENERAL AND SEVERAL WERE KILLED AND WOUNDED ON EACH SIDE
7733-106800-0027 THE INDIANS WERE EVIDENTLY FIGHTING TO GIVE THEIR FAMILIES AND VILLAGE A CHANCE TO GET AWAY WE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY SURPRISED THEM WITH A LARGER FORCE THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED TO SEE IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY WE FOUGHT THEM UNTIL DARK ALL THE TIME DRIVING THEM BEFORE US
7733-106800-0028 AT NIGHT THEY ANNOYED US CONSIDERABLY BY FIRING DOWN INTO OUR CAMP FROM THE HIGHER HILLS AND SEVERAL TIMES THE COMMAND WAS ORDERED TO DISLODGE THEM FROM THEIR POSITION AND DRIVE THEM BACK AFTER HAVING RETURNED FROM ONE OF THESE SALLIES
7733-106800-0029 MAJOR BROWN CAPTAIN SWEETMAN LIEUTENANT BACHE AND MYSELF WERE TAKING SUPPER TOGETHER WHEN WHANG CAME A BULLET INTO LIEUTENANT BACHE'S PLATE BREAKING A HOLE THROUGH IT THE BULLET CAME FROM THE GUN OF ONE OF THE INDIANS WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE HIGH BLUFF OVERLOOKING OUR CAMP
7733-106800-0030 MAJOR BROWN DECLARED IT WAS A CRACK SHOT BECAUSE IT BROKE THE PLATE WE FINISHED OUR SUPPER WITHOUT HAVING ANY MORE SUCH CLOSE CALLS AT DAYLIGHT NEXT MORNING WE STRUCK OUT ON THE TRAIL AND SOON CAME TO THE SPOT WHERE THE INDIANS HAD CAMPED THE DAY BEFORE WE COULD SEE THAT THEIR VILLAGE WAS A VERY LARGE ONE
7733-106800-0031 CONSISTING OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED LODGES AND WE PUSHED FORWARD RAPIDLY FROM THIS POINT ON THE TRAIL WHICH RAN BACK TOWARD PRAIRIE DOG CREEK ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK WE CAME IN SIGHT OF THE RETREATING VILLAGE AND SOON THE WARRIORS TURNED BACK TO GIVE US BATTLE
7733-106800-0032 THEY SET FIRE TO THE PRAIRIE GRASS IN FRONT OF US AND ON ALL SIDES IN ORDER TO DELAY US AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE KEPT UP A RUNNING FIGHT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON AND THE INDIANS REPEATEDLY ATTEMPTED TO LEAD US OFF THE TRACK OF THEIR FLYING VILLAGE BUT THEIR TRAIL WAS EASILY FOLLOWED
7733-106800-0033 AS THEY WERE CONTINUALLY DROPPING TEPEE POLES CAMP KETTLES ROBES FURS AND ALL HEAVY ARTICLES BELONGING TO THEM THEY WERE EVIDENTLY SCATTERING AND IT FINALLY BECAME DIFFICULT FOR US TO KEEP ON THE MAIN TRAIL WHEN DARKNESS SET IN WE WENT INTO CAMP
7733-106800-0034 IT BEING USELESS TO TRY TO FOLLOW THE INDIANS AFTER NIGHTFALL NEXT MORNING WE WERE AGAIN ON THE TRAIL THE INDIANS SOON SCATTERED IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT WE FOLLOWED THE MAIN TRAIL TO THE REPUBLICAN RIVER WHERE WE MADE A CUT OFF AND THEN WENT NORTH TOWARD THE PLATTE RIVER
7733-106800-0035 WE FOUND HOWEVER THAT THE INDIANS BY TRAVELING NIGHT AND DAY HAD GOT A LONG START AND THE GENERAL CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO FOLLOW THEM ANY FARTHER THE GENERAL TOLD ME THAT THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH WOULD BE TOWARD THE HEADWATERS OF THE BEAVER AND ASKED ME THE DISTANCE
7733-106800-0036 I REPLIED THAT IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES AND HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE IT THE NEXT DAY GETTING AN EARLY START IN THE MORNING WE STRUCK OUT ACROSS THE PRAIRIE MY POSITION AS GUIDE BEING AHEAD OF THE ADVANCE GUARD ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK GENERAL CARR OVERTOOK ME
7733-106800-0037 AND ASKED ME HOW FAR I SUPPOSED IT WAS TO WATER I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT MILES ALTHOUGH WE COULD SEE NO SIGN OR INDICATION OF ANY STREAM IN FRONT PEPOON'S SCOUTS SAY YOU ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SAID THE GENERAL
7733-106800-0038 AND IN THE WAY YOU ARE BEARING IT WILL BE FIFTEEN MILES BEFORE YOU CAN STRIKE ANY OF THE BRANCHES OF THE BEAVER AND THAT WHEN YOU DO YOU WILL FIND NO WATER FOR THE BEAVERS ARE DRY AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR AT THAT POINT GENERAL I THINK THE SCOUTS ARE MISTAKEN SAID I
7733-106800-0039 FOR THE BEAVER HAS MORE WATER NEAR ITS HEAD THAN IT HAS BELOW AND AT THE PLACE WHERE WE WILL STRIKE THE STREAM WE WILL FIND IMMENSE BEAVER DAMS LARGE ENOUGH AND STRONG ENOUGH TO CROSS THE WHOLE COMMAND IF YOU WISH WELL CODY GO AHEAD SAID HE I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU BUT REMEMBER THAT I DON'T WANT A DRY CAMP
7733-106800-0040 NO DANGER OF THAT SAID I AND THEN I RODE ON LEAVING HIM TO RETURN TO THE COMMAND AS I HAD PREDICTED WE FOUND WATER SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES FARTHER ON WHERE WE CAME UPON A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE STREAM A TRIBUTARY OF THE BEAVER HIDDEN IN THE HILLS
7733-106800-0041 WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN SELECTING A GOOD HALTING PLACE AND OBTAINING FRESH SPRING WATER AND GRASS THE GENERAL UPON LEARNING FROM ME THAT THE STREAM WHICH WAS ONLY EIGHT OR NINE MILES LONG HAD NO NAME TOOK OUT HIS MAP AND LOCATED IT
7733-106800-0042 AND NAMED IT CODY'S CREEK WHICH NAME IT STILL BEARS WE PULLED OUT EARLY NEXT MORNING FOR THE BEAVER AND WHEN WE WERE APPROACHING THE STREAM I RODE ON AHEAD OF THE ADVANCE GUARD IN ORDER TO FIND THE CROSSING JUST AS I TURNED A BEND OF THE CREEK
7733-106800-0043 BANG WENT A SHOT AND DOWN WENT MY HORSE MYSELF WITH HIM I DISENTANGLED MYSELF AND JUMPED BEHIND THE DEAD BODY LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THE SHOT HAD COME I SAW TWO INDIANS AND AT ONCE TURNED MY GUN LOOSE ON THEM
7733-106800-0044 BUT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT I MISSED MY AIM THEY FIRED TWO OR THREE MORE SHOTS AND I RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT WOUNDING ONE OF THEIR HORSES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CREEK GOING OVER THE HILL I OBSERVED A FEW LODGES MOVING RAPIDLY AWAY
7733-106800-0045 AND ALSO SOME MOUNTED WARRIORS WHO COULD SEE ME AND WHO KEPT BLAZING AWAY WITH THEIR GUNS THE TWO INDIANS WHO HAD FIRED AT ME AND HAD KILLED MY HORSE WERE RETREATING ACROSS THE CREEK ON A BEAVER DAM I SENT A FEW SHOTS AFTER THEM TO ACCELERATE THEIR SPEED
7733-106800-0046 AND ALSO FIRED AT THE ONES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM I WAS UNDECIDED AS TO WHETHER IT WAS BEST TO RUN BACK TO THE COMMAND ON FOOT OR HOLD MY POSITION I KNEW THAT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THE TROOPS WOULD COME UP AND I THEREFORE DECIDED TO HOLD MY POSITION
7733-106800-0047 WHEN GENERAL CARR CAME UP HE ORDERED COMPANY I TO GO IN PURSUIT OF THE BAND I ACCOMPANIED LIEUTENANT BRADY WHO COMMANDED AND WE HAD A RUNNING FIGHT WITH THE INDIANS LASTING SEVERAL HOURS WE CAPTURED SEVERAL HEAD OF THEIR HORSES AND MOST OF THEIR LODGES
7733-106800-0048 AT NIGHT WE RETURNED TO THE COMMAND WHICH BY THIS TIME HAD CROSSED THE CREEK ON THE BEAVER DAM WE SCOUTED FOR SEVERAL DAYS ALONG THE RIVER AND HAD TWO OR THREE LIVELY SKIRMISHES FINALLY OUR SUPPLIES BEGAN TO RUN LOW AND GENERAL CARR GAVE ORDERS TO RETURN TO FORT WALLACE
7733-106800-0049 WHICH WE REACHED THREE DAYS AFTERWARD AND WHERE WE REMAINED SEVERAL DAYS VERY SOON AFTER GENERAL CARR RECEIVED ORDERS FROM GENERAL SHERIDAN FOR A WINTER'S CAMPAIGN IN THE CANADIAN RIVER COUNTRY INSTRUCTING HIM TO PROCEED AT ONCE TO FORT LYON COLORADO
7733-106800-0050 AND THERE TO FIT OUT FOR THE EXPEDITION LEAVING FORT WALLACE IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WE ARRIVED AT FORT LYON IN THE LATTER PART OF THE MONTH WITHOUT SPECIAL INCIDENT AND AT ONCE BEGAN OUR PREPARATIONS FOR INVADING THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY
7733-106800-0051 GENERAL PENROSE HAD LEFT HIS POST THREE WEEKS PREVIOUSLY WITH A COMMAND OF SOME THREE HUNDRED MEN HE HAD TAKEN NO WAGONS WITH HIM AND HIS SUPPLY TRAIN WAS COMPOSED ONLY OF PACK MULES GENERAL CARR WAS ORDERED TO FOLLOW WITH SUPPLIES ON HIS TRAIL AND OVERTAKE HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
7733-106800-0052 I WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO CATCH UP WITH PENROSE'S COMMAND AS MY OLD FRIEND WILD BILL WAS AMONG HIS SCOUTS WE FOLLOWED THE TRAIL VERY EASILY FOR THE FIRST THREE DAYS AND THEN WE WERE CAUGHT IN FREEZE OUT CANYON BY A FEARFUL SNOWSTORM
7733-106800-0053 WHICH COMPELLED US TO GO INTO CAMP FOR A DAY THE GROUND NOW BEING COVERED WITH SNOW WE FOUND IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW PENROSE'S TRAIL ANY FARTHER ESPECIALLY AS HE HAD LEFT NO SIGN TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION HE WAS GOING GENERAL CARR SENT FOR ME
7733-106800-0054 AND SAID THAT AS IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD NOT LOSE THE TRAIL HE WISHED THAT I WOULD TAKE SOME SCOUTS WITH ME AND WHILE THE COMMAND REMAINED IN CAMP PUSH ON AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND SEE IF I COULD NOT DISCOVER SOME TRACES OF PENROSE OR WHERE HE HAD CAMPED AT ANY TIME ACCOMPANIED BY FOUR MEN
7733-106800-0055 I STARTED OUT IN THE BLINDING SNOWSTORM TAKING A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION WE RODE TWENTY FOUR MILES AND UPON REACHING A TRIBUTARY OF THE CIMARRON WE SCOUTED UP AND DOWN THE STREAM FOR A FEW MILES AND FINALLY FOUND ONE OF PENROSE'S OLD CAMPS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
7733-106800-0056 SO RIDING DOWN INTO A SHELTERED PLACE IN THE BEND OF THE CREEK WE BUILT A FIRE AND BROILED SOME VENISON FROM A DEER WHICH WE HAD SHOT DURING THE DAY AND AFTER EATING A SUBSTANTIAL MEAL I LEFT THE FOUR MEN THERE WHILE I RETURNED TO BRING UP THE TROOPS
7733-106800-0057 IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE CAMP A LIGHT WAS STILL BURNING IN THE GENERAL'S TENT HE HAVING REMAINED AWAKE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING MY RETURN HE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME AND WAS OVERJOYED AT THE INFORMATION I BROUGHT
7733-106800-0058 FOR HE HAD GREAT FEARS CONCERNING THE SAFETY OF GENERAL PENROSE THE COMMAND TOOK UP ITS MARCH NEXT DAY FOR THE CIMARRON AND HAD A HARD TRAMP OF IT ON ACCOUNT OF THE SNOW HAVING DRIFTED TO A GREAT DEPTH IN MANY OF THE RAVINES AND IN SOME PLACES THE TEAMSTERS HAD TO SHOVEL THEIR WAY THROUGH
7733-106800-0059 WE ARRIVED AT THE CIMARRON AT SUNDOWN AND WENT INTO CAMP UPON LOOKING AROUND NEXT MORNING WE FOUND THAT PENROSE HAVING BEEN UNENCUMBERED BY WAGONS HAD KEPT ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CIMARRON
7733-106800-0060 BUT KNOWING THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW DOWN THE RIVER GENERAL CARR CONCLUDED TO TAKE THE BEST WAGON ROUTE ALONG THE STREAM WHICH I DISCOVERED TO BE ON THE EAST SIDE BEFORE WE COULD MAKE ANY HEADWAY WITH OUR WAGON TRAIN WE HAD TO LEAVE THE RIVER AND GET OUT ON THE DIVIDE
7733-106800-0061 WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT DAY IN FINDING A SPLENDID ROAD FOR SOME DISTANCE UNTIL WE WERE ALL AT ONCE BROUGHT TO A STANDSTILL ON A HIGH TABLELAND OVERLOOKING A BEAUTIFUL WINDING CREEK THAT LAY FAR BELOW US IN THE VALLEY THE QUESTION THAT TROUBLED US
7733-106800-0062 WAS HOW WE WERE TO GET THE WAGONS DOWN WE WERE NOW IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE RATTOON MOUNTAINS AND THE BLUFF WE WERE ON WAS VERY STEEP CODY WE'RE IN A NICE FIX NOW SAID GENERAL CARR OH THAT'S NOTHING WAS MY REPLY

7733-106800-0064 BUT HOW TO GET THE WAGONS DOWN THERE IS A PUZZLER TO ME SAID HE BY THE TIME YOU ARE LOCATED IN YOUR CAMP YOUR WAGONS SHALL BE THERE SAID I ALL RIGHT CODY I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU AS YOU SEEM TO WANT TO BE BOSS HE REPLIED PLEASANTLY
7733-106800-0065 HE AT ONCE ORDERED THE COMMAND TO DISMOUNT AND LEAD THE HORSES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THE WAGON TRAIN WAS A MILE IN THE REAR AND WHEN IT CAME UP ONE OF THE DRIVERS ASKED HOW ARE WE GOING DOWN THERE RUN DOWN SLIDE DOWN OR FALL DOWN ANY WAY TO GET DOWN
7733-106800-0066 SAID I WE CAN NEVER DO IT IT'S TOO STEEP THE WAGONS WILL RUN OVER THE MULES
7733-106800-0067 THE MULES HAVE GOT TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY WAS MY REPLY I TOLD WILSON THE CHIEF WAGON MASTER TO BRING ON HIS MESS WAGON WHICH WAS AT THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN AND I WOULD TRY THE EXPERIMENT AT LEAST WILSON DROVE THE TEAM AND WAGON TO THE BRINK OF THE HILL
7733-106800-0068 AND FOLLOWING MY DIRECTIONS HE BROUGHT OUT SOME EXTRA CHAINS WITH WHICH WE LOCKED THE WHEELS ON EACH SIDE AND THEN ROUGH LOCKED THEM WE NOW STARTED THE WAGON DOWN THE HILL THE WHEEL HORSES OR RATHER THE WHEEL MULES
7733-106800-0069 WERE GOOD ON THE HOLD BACK AND WE GOT ALONG FINELY UNTIL WE NEARLY REACHED THE BOTTOM WHEN THE WAGON CROWDED THE MULES SO HARD
7733-106800-0070 THREE OTHER WAGONS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN THE SAME WAY AND IN HALF AN HOUR EVERY WAGON WAS IN CAMP WITHOUT THE LEAST ACCIDENT HAVING OCCURRED IT WAS INDEED AN EXCITING SIGHT TO SEE THE SIX MULE TEAMS COME STRAIGHT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
7733-106800-0071 WE HAD NO TROUBLE IN FOLLOWING PENROSE'S TRAIL WHICH LED US IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION TOWARD THE CANADIAN RIVER NO INDIANS WERE SEEN NOR ANY SIGNS OF THEM FOUND ONE DAY WHILE RIDING IN ADVANCE OF THE COMMAND DOWN SAN FRANCISCO CREEK

7733-106800-0077 GENERAL CARR CONCLUDED FROM WHAT THEY COULD TELL HIM
7733-106800-0078 FOR THEY KNEW NOT WHERE THEY WERE THEMSELVES HAVING LEARNED THAT GENERAL PENROSE'S TROOPS WERE IN SUCH BAD SHAPE GENERAL CARR ORDERED MAJOR BROWN TO START OUT THE NEXT MORNING WITH TWO COMPANIES OF CAVALRY AND FIFTY PACK MULES LOADED WITH PROVISIONS
7733-106800-0079 AND TO MAKE ALL POSSIBLE SPEED TO REACH AND RELIEVE THE SUFFERING SOLDIERS I ACCOMPANIED THIS DETACHMENT AND ON THE THIRD DAY OUT WE FOUND THE HALF FAMISHED SOLDIERS CAMPED ON THE PALLADORA THE CAMP PRESENTED A PITIFUL SIGHT INDEED
7733-106800-0080 FOR OVER TWO WEEKS THE MEN HAD HAD ONLY QUARTER RATIONS AND WERE NOW NEARLY STARVED TO DEATH OVER TWO HUNDRED HORSES AND MULES WERE LYING DEAD HAVING DIED FROM FATIGUE AND STARVATION GENERAL PENROSE FEARING THAT GENERAL CARR WOULD NOT FIND HIM
7733-106800-0081 HAD SENT BACK A COMPANY OF THE SEVENTH CAVALRY TO FORT LYON FOR SUPPLIES BUT NO WORD HAD AS YET BEEN HEARD FROM THEM THE RATIONS WHICH MAJOR BROWN BROUGHT TO THE COMMAND CAME NONE TOO SOON AND WERE THE MEANS OF SAVING MANY LIVES
