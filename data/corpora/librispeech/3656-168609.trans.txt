3656-168609-0000 THE DISASTER OF THE HOLLOW ROAD HAD DECIMATED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED THEM THEY BELONGED TO THAT CLASS OF MEN WHO WHEN DIMINISHED IN NUMBER INCREASE IN COURAGE WATHIER'S COLUMN ALONE HAD SUFFERED IN THE DISASTER
3656-168609-0001 DELORT'S COLUMN WHICH NEY HAD DEFLECTED TO THE LEFT AS THOUGH HE HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF AN AMBUSH HAD ARRIVED WHOLE
3656-168609-0002 AT FULL SPEED WITH BRIDLES LOOSE SWORDS IN THEIR TEETH PISTOLS IN FIST SUCH WAS THE ATTACK THERE ARE MOMENTS IN BATTLES IN WHICH THE SOUL HARDENS THE MAN UNTIL THE SOLDIER IS CHANGED INTO A STATUE AND WHEN ALL THIS FLESH TURNS INTO GRANITE
3656-168609-0003 THE ENGLISH BATTALIONS DESPERATELY ASSAULTED DID NOT STIR THEN IT WAS TERRIBLE ALL THE FACES OF THE ENGLISH SQUARES WERE ATTACKED AT ONCE A FRENZIED WHIRL ENVELOPED THEM THAT COLD INFANTRY REMAINED IMPASSIVE
3656-168609-0004 THE SECOND RANKS SHOT THEM DOWN BEHIND THE SECOND RANK THE CANNONEERS CHARGED THEIR GUNS THE FRONT OF THE SQUARE PARTED PERMITTED THE PASSAGE OF AN ERUPTION OF GRAPE SHOT AND CLOSED AGAIN
3656-168609-0005 THEIR GREAT HORSES REARED STRODE ACROSS THE RANKS LEAPED OVER THE BAYONETS AND FELL GIGANTIC IN THE MIDST OF THESE FOUR LIVING WELLS
3656-168609-0006 FILES OF MEN DISAPPEARED GROUND TO DUST UNDER THE HORSES THE BAYONETS PLUNGED INTO THE BELLIES OF THESE CENTAURS HENCE A HIDEOUSNESS OF WOUNDS WHICH HAS PROBABLY NEVER BEEN SEEN ANYWHERE ELSE THE SQUARES
3656-168609-0007 WASTED BY THIS MAD CAVALRY CLOSED UP THEIR RANKS WITHOUT FLINCHING INEXHAUSTIBLE IN THE MATTER OF GRAPE SHOT THEY CREATED EXPLOSIONS IN THEIR ASSAILANTS MIDST THE FORM OF THIS COMBAT WAS MONSTROUS
3656-168609-0008 THEY WERE A TEMPEST EACH SQUARE WAS A VOLCANO ATTACKED BY A CLOUD LAVA CONTENDED WITH LIGHTNING THE SQUARE ON THE EXTREME RIGHT THE MOST EXPOSED OF ALL BEING IN THE AIR WAS ALMOST ANNIHILATED AT THE VERY FIRST SHOCK
3656-168609-0009 THE BAGPIPE PLAYER IN THE CENTRE DROPPED HIS MELANCHOLY EYES FILLED WITH THE REFLECTIONS OF THE FORESTS AND THE LAKES IN PROFOUND INATTENTION WHILE MEN WERE BEING EXTERMINATED AROUND HIM AND SEATED ON A DRUM WITH HIS PIBROCH UNDER HIS ARM
3656-168609-0010 PLAYED THE HIGHLAND AIRS THESE SCOTCHMEN DIED THINKING OF BEN LOTHIAN AS DID THE GREEKS RECALLING ARGOS
3656-168609-0011 THE CUIRASSIERS RELATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER AND STILL FURTHER DIMINISHED BY THE CATASTROPHE OF THE RAVINE HAD ALMOST THE WHOLE ENGLISH ARMY AGAINST THEM BUT THEY MULTIPLIED THEMSELVES SO THAT EACH MAN OF THEM WAS EQUAL TO TEN
3656-168609-0012 NEVERTHELESS SOME HANOVERIAN BATTALIONS YIELDED WELLINGTON PERCEIVED IT AND THOUGHT OF HIS CAVALRY HAD NAPOLEON AT THAT SAME MOMENT THOUGHT OF HIS INFANTRY HE WOULD HAVE WON THE BATTLE
3656-168609-0013 THIS FORGETFULNESS WAS HIS GREAT AND FATAL MISTAKE ALL AT ONCE THE CUIRASSIERS WHO HAD BEEN THE ASSAILANTS FOUND THEMSELVES ASSAILED THE ENGLISH CAVALRY WAS AT THEIR BACK BEFORE THEM TWO SQUARES
3656-168609-0014 BEHIND THEM SOMERSET SOMERSET MEANT FOURTEEN HUNDRED DRAGOONS OF THE GUARD ON THE RIGHT SOMERSET HAD DORNBERG WITH THE GERMAN LIGHT HORSE AND ON HIS LEFT TRIP WITH THE BELGIAN CARABINEERS THE CUIRASSIERS ATTACKED ON THE FLANK AND IN FRONT
3656-168609-0015 BEFORE AND IN THE REAR BY INFANTRY AND CAVALRY HAD TO FACE ALL SIDES WHAT MATTERED IT TO THEM THEY WERE A WHIRLWIND THEIR VALOR WAS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLE IN ADDITION TO THIS THEY HAD BEHIND THEM THE BATTERY
3656-168609-0016 WHICH WAS STILL THUNDERING IT WAS NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD BE SO OR THEY COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN THE BACK ONE OF THEIR CUIRASSES
3656-168609-0017 FOR SUCH FRENCHMEN NOTHING LESS THAN SUCH ENGLISHMEN WAS NEEDED IT WAS NO LONGER A HAND TO HAND CONFLICT IT WAS A SHADOW A FURY A DIZZY TRANSPORT OF SOULS AND COURAGE A HURRICANE OF LIGHTNING SWORDS
3656-168609-0018 IN AN INSTANT THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED DRAGOON GUARDS NUMBERED ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED FULLER THEIR LIEUTENANT COLONEL FELL DEAD NEY RUSHED UP WITH THE LANCERS
3656-168609-0019 THE PLATEAU OF MONT SAINT JEAN WAS CAPTURED RECAPTURED CAPTURED AGAIN
3656-168609-0020 OR TO PUT IT MORE EXACTLY THE WHOLE OF THAT FORMIDABLE ROUT COLLARED EACH OTHER WITHOUT RELEASING THE OTHER THE SQUARES STILL HELD FIRM THERE WERE A DOZEN ASSAULTS NEY HAD FOUR HORSES KILLED UNDER HIM
3656-168609-0021 THIS CONFLICT LASTED TWO HOURS THE ENGLISH ARMY WAS PROFOUNDLY SHAKEN THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HAD THEY NOT BEEN ENFEEBLED IN THEIR FIRST SHOCK BY THE DISASTER OF THE HOLLOW ROAD THE CUIRASSIERS WOULD HAVE OVERWHELMED THE CENTRE
3656-168609-0022 TOOK OR SPIKED SIXTY PIECES OF ORDNANCE AND CAPTURED FROM THE ENGLISH REGIMENTS SIX FLAGS
3656-168609-0023 OF THE GUARD BORE TO THE EMPEROR IN FRONT OF THE FARM OF LA BELLE ALLIANCE WELLINGTON'S SITUATION HAD GROWN WORSE THIS STRANGE BATTLE WAS LIKE A DUEL BETWEEN TWO RAGING WOUNDED MEN EACH OF WHOM STILL FIGHTING AND STILL RESISTING
3656-168609-0024 IS EXPENDING ALL HIS BLOOD WHICH OF THE TWO WILL BE THE FIRST TO FALL THE CONFLICT ON THE PLATEAU CONTINUED WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE CUIRASSIERS NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT ON THE DAY AFTER THE BATTLE
3656-168609-0025 GENAPPE LA HULPE AND BRUSSELS MEET AND INTERSECT EACH OTHER
3656-168609-0026 ONE OF THE MEN WHO PICKED UP THE BODY STILL LIVES AT MONT SAINT JEAN HIS NAME IS DEHAZE HE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AT THAT TIME WELLINGTON FELT THAT HE WAS YIELDING THE CRISIS WAS AT HAND THE CUIRASSIERS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED
3656-168609-0027 SINCE THE CENTRE WAS NOT BROKEN THROUGH AS EVERY ONE WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE PLATEAU NO ONE HELD IT AND IN FACT IT REMAINED TO A GREAT EXTENT WITH THE ENGLISH WELLINGTON HELD THE VILLAGE AND THE CULMINATING PLAIN NEY HAD ONLY THE CREST AND THE SLOPE
3656-168609-0028 THEY SEEMED ROOTED IN THAT FATAL SOIL ON BOTH SIDES BUT THE WEAKENING OF THE ENGLISH SEEMED IRREMEDIABLE THE BLEEDING OF THAT ARMY WAS HORRIBLE KEMPT ON THE LEFT WING DEMANDED REINFORCEMENTS THERE ARE NONE
3656-168609-0029 REPLIED WELLINGTON HE MUST LET HIMSELF BE KILLED ALMOST AT THAT SAME MOMENT A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE WHICH PAINTS THE EXHAUSTION OF THE TWO ARMIES NEY DEMANDED INFANTRY FROM NAPOLEON AND NAPOLEON EXCLAIMED INFANTRY
3656-168609-0030 WHERE DOES HE EXPECT ME TO GET IT DOES HE THINK I CAN MAKE IT NEVERTHELESS THE ENGLISH ARMY WAS IN THE WORSE CASE OF THE TWO THE FURIOUS ONSETS OF THOSE GREAT SQUADRONS WITH CUIRASSES OF IRON AND BREASTS OF STEEL HAD GROUND THE INFANTRY TO NOTHING
3656-168609-0031 A FEW MEN CLUSTERED ROUND A FLAG MARKED THE POST OF A REGIMENT SUCH AND SUCH A BATTALION WAS COMMANDED ONLY BY A CAPTAIN OR A LIEUTENANT ALTEN'S DIVISION
3656-168609-0032 HARDLY ANYTHING WAS LEFT OF THOSE DUTCH GRENADIERS WHO INTERMINGLED WITH SPANIARDS IN OUR RANKS IN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN FOUGHT AGAINST WELLINGTON AND WHO IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN RALLIED TO THE ENGLISH STANDARD FOUGHT AGAINST NAPOLEON
3656-168609-0033 THE LOSS IN OFFICERS WAS CONSIDERABLE LORD UXBRIDGE WHO HAD HIS LEG BURIED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HAD HIS KNEE SHATTERED IF ON THE FRENCH SIDE IN THAT TUSSLE OF THE CUIRASSIERS DELORT L'HERITIER
3656-168609-0034 ON THE SIDE OF THE ENGLISH THERE WAS ALTEN WOUNDED BARNE WOUNDED DELANCEY KILLED VAN MEEREN KILLED OMPTEDA KILLED THE WHOLE OF WELLINGTON'S STAFF DECIMATED AND ENGLAND HAD THE WORSE OF IT IN THAT BLOODY SCALE
3656-168609-0035 THE SECOND REGIMENT OF FOOT GUARDS HAD LOST FIVE LIEUTENANT COLONELS FOUR CAPTAINS AND THREE ENSIGNS THE FIRST BATTALION OF THE THIRTIETH INFANTRY HAD LOST TWENTY FOUR OFFICERS AND ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SOLDIERS THE SEVENTY NINTH HIGHLANDERS HAD LOST TWENTY FOUR OFFICERS WOUNDED
3656-168609-0036 EIGHTEEN OFFICERS KILLED FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SOLDIERS KILLED THE HANOVERIAN HUSSARS OF CUMBERLAND A WHOLE REGIMENT WITH COLONEL HACKE AT ITS HEAD WHO WAS DESTINED TO BE TRIED LATER ON AND CASHIERED HAD TURNED BRIDLE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE FRAY
3656-168609-0037 THE TRANSPORTS AMMUNITION WAGONS THE BAGGAGE WAGONS THE WAGONS FILLED WITH WOUNDED ON PERCEIVING THAT THE FRENCH WERE GAINING GROUND AND APPROACHING THE FOREST RUSHED HEADLONG THITHER THE DUTCH MOWED DOWN BY THE FRENCH CAVALRY CRIED ALARM
3656-168609-0038 ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF EYE WITNESSES WHO ARE STILL ALIVE
3656-168609-0039 A NUMBER OF BATTERIES LAY UNHORSED THESE FACTS ARE ATTESTED BY SIBORNE AND PRINGLE EXAGGERATING THE DISASTER GOES SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE ANGLO DUTCH ARMY WAS REDUCED TO THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND MEN
3656-168609-0040 THE IRON DUKE REMAINED CALM BUT HIS LIPS BLANCHED VINCENT THE AUSTRIAN COMMISSIONER ALAVA THE SPANISH COMMISSIONER WHO WERE PRESENT AT THE BATTLE IN THE ENGLISH STAFF THOUGHT THE DUKE LOST
3656-168609-0041 AT FIVE O'CLOCK WELLINGTON DREW OUT HIS WATCH AND HE WAS HEARD TO MURMUR THESE SINISTER WORDS BLUCHER OR NIGHT IT WAS AT ABOUT THAT MOMENT THAT A DISTANT LINE OF BAYONETS GLEAMED ON THE HEIGHTS IN THE DIRECTION OF FRISCHEMONT
