666-11243-0023 THE NEXT EVENING HENRY CAME UP SHE OBSERVED THAT HIS FACE HAD A GRAVE LOOK BUT INTENT ON HER OWN DIFFICULTIES SHE DID NOT REMARK ON IT AND PROCEEDED AT ONCE TO DO WHAT SHE RESOLVED TO DO
666-11243-0024 IT WAS A COLD NIGHT IN NOVEMBER YET THE MISER WRATHFULLY SULLEN CHOSE TO SIT IN HIS OFFICE WITHOUT A FIRE AGNES WAS WORKING SUMS IN THE KITCHEN HENRY ANNA BEGAN
666-11243-0025 I'VE HAD A DIFFICULTY WITH FATHER AND I MUST TELL YOU NOT ABOUT THE WEDDING I HOPE HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT MONEY OF COURSE HENRY I CAN'T GET MARRIED WITHOUT A LOT OF MONEY WHY NOT HE INQUIRED

666-11243-0029 HENRY'S FACE BROKE INTO A LAUGH AND ANNA WAS OBLIGED TO SMILE CAPITAL HE SAID COULDN'T BE BETTER I WANT YOU TO TELL ME HOW MUCH I'VE GOT IN THE BANK SHE SAID
666-11243-0030 I ONLY KNOW I'M ALWAYS PAYING IN ODD CHEQUES HE EXAMINED THE THREE BOOKS A VERY TIDY BIT HE SAID SOMETHING OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS SO YOU CAN DRAW CHEQUES AT YOUR EASE

666-11243-0032 THERE OUGHT TO BE A SETTLEMENT ON YOU STILL IF YOUR FATHER SAYS NOTHING IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING FATHER WILL SAY NOTHING NOW SHE SAID YOU'VE NEVER SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN IT HENRY
666-11243-0033 BUT AS WE'RE TALKING OF MONEY I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THAT FATHER SAYS I'M WORTH FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS THE MAN OF BUSINESS WAS ASTONISHED AND ENRAPTURED BEYOND MEASURE HIS COUNTENANCE SHONE WITH DELIGHT
666-11243-0034 SURELY NOT HE PROTESTED FORMALLY THAT'S WHAT FATHER TOLD ME AND HE MADE ME READ A LIST OF SHARES AND SO ON
666-11243-0035 HE HAD NOT EXPECTED MORE THAN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS AND EVEN THIS SUM HAD DAZZLED HIS IMAGINATION HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD ONLY TAKEN THE HOUSE AT TOFT END ON A YEARLY TENANCY
666-11243-0036 HE NOW SAW HIMSELF THE DOMINANT FIGURE IN ALL THE FIVE TOWNS LATER IN THE EVENING HE DISCLOSED PERFUNCTORILY THE MATTER WHICH HAD BEEN A SERIOUS WEIGHT ON HIS MIND WHEN HE ENTERED THE HOUSE
666-11243-0037 BUT WHICH THIS REVELATION OF VAST WEALTH HAD DIMINISHED TO A TRIFLE TITUS PRICE HAD BEEN THE TREASURER OF THE BUILDING FUND WHICH THE BAZAAR WAS DESIGNED TO ASSIST MYNORS HAD ASSUMED THE POSITION OF THE DEAD MAN
666-11243-0038 AND THAT DAY IN GOING THROUGH THE ACCOUNTS HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT A SUM OF FIFTY POUNDS WAS MISSING IT'S A DREADFUL THING FOR WILLIE IF IT GETS ABOUT HE SAID A TALE OF THAT SORT WOULD FOLLOW HIM TO AUSTRALIA
666-11243-0039 OH HENRY IT IS SHE EXCLAIMED SORROW STRICKEN BUT WE MUSTN'T LET IT GET ABOUT LET US PAY THE MONEY OURSELVES YOU MUST ENTER IT IN THE BOOKS AND SAY NOTHING THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID FIRMLY
666-11243-0040 I CAN'T ALTER THE ACCOUNTS AT LEAST I CAN'T ALTER THE BANK BOOK AND THE VOUCHERS THE AUDITOR WOULD DETECT IT IN A MINUTE BESIDES I SHOULD NOT BE DOING MY DUTY IF I KEPT A THING LIKE THIS FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT MINISTER
666-11243-0041 HE AT ANY RATE MUST KNOW AND PERHAPS THE STEWARDS BUT YOU CAN URGE THEM TO SAY NOTHING TELL THEM THAT YOU WILL MAKE IT GOOD I WILL WRITE A CHEQUE AT ONCE
666-11243-0042 I HAD MEANT TO FIND THE FIFTY MYSELF HE SAID IT WAS A PEDDLING SUM TO HIM NOW
666-11243-0043 IF YOU LIKE HE URGED SMILING FAINTLY AT HER EAGERNESS THE THING IS BOUND TO BE KEPT QUIET IT WOULD CREATE SUCH A FRIGHTFUL SCANDAL POOR OLD CHAP HE ADDED CARELESSLY
666-11243-0044 I SUPPOSE HE WAS HARD RUN AND MEANT TO PUT IT BACK AS THEY ALL DO MEAN BUT IT WAS USELESS FOR MYNORS TO AFFECT DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS OR MOURNFUL SYMPATHY WITH THE ERRORS OF A DEAD SINNER
666-11243-0045 THE FIFTY THOUSAND DANCED A JIG IN HIS BRAIN THAT NIGHT ANNA WAS ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATING THE MISFORTUNE OF WILLIE PRICE SHE PRAYED WILDLY THAT HE MIGHT NEVER LEARN THE FULL DEPTH OF HIS FATHER'S FALL
666-11243-0046 THE MISERABLE ROBBERY OF SARAH'S WAGES WAS BURIED FOR EVERMORE AND THIS NEW DELINQUENCY WHICH ALL WOULD REGARD AS FLAGRANT SACRILEGE MUST BE BURIED ALSO A SOUL LESS LOYAL THAN ANNA'S MIGHT HAVE FEARED
666-11243-0047 THAT WILLIE A SELF CONVICTED FORGER HAD BEEN A PARTY TO THE EMBEZZLEMENT BUT ANNA KNEW THAT IT COULD NOT BE SO
666-11243-0048 THE FIRST INTOXICATION HAVING PASSED HE MADE NO FURTHER REFERENCE OF ANY KIND TO ANNA'S FORTUNE THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEIR MARRIED LIFE WERE PLANNED ON A SCALE WHICH IGNORED THE FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS
666-11243-0049 HE DID NOT PRECISELY ANTICIPATE TROUBLE BUT THE FACT HAD NOT ESCAPED HIM
666-11243-0050 HE WAS IN NO HURRY TO ENLARGE HIS BORDERS HE KNEW THAT THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN EVERY DAY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS IN EVERY YEAR AND THIRTY GOOD YEARS IN LIFE STILL LEFT TO HIM AND THEREFORE
666-11243-0051 THAT THERE WOULD BE AMPLE TIME AFTER THE WEDDING FOR THE EXECUTION OF HIS PURPOSES IN REGARD TO THAT FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS MEANWHILE HE TOLD ANNA THAT HE HAD SET ASIDE
666-11243-0052 TWO HUNDRED POUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF FURNITURE FOR THE PRIORY A MODEST SUM BUT HE JUDGED IT SUFFICIENT HIS METHOD WAS TO BUY A PIECE AT A TIME ALWAYS SECOND HAND BUT ALWAYS GOOD
666-11243-0053 THE BARGAIN HUNT WAS UP AND ANNA SOON YIELDED TO ITS MILD SATISFACTIONS IN THE MATTER OF HER TROUSSEAU AND THE HOUSE LINEN ANNA HAVING OBTAINED THE NEEDED MONEY AT SO DEAR A COST
666-11243-0054 FOUND YET ANOTHER OBSTACLE IN THE IMMINENT BAZAAR WHICH OCCUPIED MISSUS SUTTON AND BEATRICE SO COMPLETELY THAT THEY COULD NOT CONTRIVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO ASSIST HER IN SHOPPING IT WAS DECIDED BETWEEN THEM
666-11243-0055 THAT EVERY ARTICLE SHOULD BE BOUGHT READY MADE AND SEAMED AND THAT THE FIRST WEEK OF THE NEW YEAR IF INDEED MISSUS SUTTON SURVIVED THE BAZAAR SHOULD BE ENTIRELY AND ABSOLUTELY DEVOTED TO ANNA'S BUSINESS
666-11243-0056 AT NIGHTS WHEN SHE HAD LEISURE TO THINK ANNA WAS ASTONISHED HOW DURING THE DAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER PREOCCUPATIONS
666-11243-0057 BUT SHE NEVER SLEPT WITHOUT THINKING OF WILLIE PRICE AND HOPING THAT NO FURTHER DISASTER MIGHT OVERTAKE HIM THE INCIDENT OF THE EMBEZZLED FIFTY POUNDS HAD BEEN CLOSED
666-11243-0058 HE HAD ACQUAINTED THE MINISTER WITH THE FACTS AND MISTER BANKS HAD DECIDED THAT THE TWO CIRCUIT STEWARDS MUST BE INFORMED BEYOND THESE THE SCANDALOUS SECRET WAS NOT TO GO BUT ANNA WONDERED WHETHER A SECRET SHARED BY FIVE PERSONS
666-11243-0059 COULD LONG REMAIN A SECRET THE BAZAAR WAS A TRIUMPHANT AND UNPARALLELED SUCCESS AND OF THE SEVEN STALLS THE SUNDAY SCHOOL STALL STOOD FIRST EACH NIGHT IN THE NIGHTLY RETURNS THE SCENE IN THE TOWN HALL
666-11243-0060 ON THE FOURTH AND FINAL NIGHT A SATURDAY WAS AS DELIRIOUS AND GAY AS A CARNIVAL FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS HAD BEEN RAISED UP TO TEA TIME AND IT WAS THE IMPASSIONED DESIRE OF EVERYONE TO ACHIEVE FIVE HUNDRED
