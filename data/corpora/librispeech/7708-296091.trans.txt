7708-296091-0000 THE TASKS OF PEACE NOW THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND HAD BEEN ON TIPTOE FOR SOME DAYS WITH EAGERNESS WAITING TO WELCOME THE HEROINE OF THE CRIMEA BACK TO HER NATIVE SHORES
7708-296091-0001 THEY WOULD GIVE HER SUCH A RECEPTION AS NO ONE HAD EVER YET HAD IN THAT LAND OF HOSPITALITY AND WELCOMINGS SHE SHOULD HAVE BELLS AND CANNON AND BONFIRES PROCESSIONS AND DEPUTATIONS AND ADDRESSES
7708-296091-0002 SHE SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING THAT ANYBODY COULD THINK OF WHEN THEY FOUND THAT THEIR HEROINE HAD SLIPPED QUIETLY THROUGH THEIR FINGERS AS IT WERE AND WAS BACK IN HER OWN PEACEFUL HOME ONCE MORE PEOPLE WERE SADLY DISAPPOINTED
7708-296091-0003 THEY MUST GIVE UP THE CANNON AND THE BONFIRES BUT AT LEAST THEY MIGHT HAVE A GLIMPSE OF HER SO HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE CROWDED THE ROADS AND LANES ABOUT LEA HURST WAITING AND WATCHING AN OLD LADY LIVING AT THE PARK GATE TOLD MISSUS TOOLEY
7708-296091-0004 FOLKS CAME IN CARRIAGES AND ON FOOT
7708-296091-0005 SOME OF THEM WITHOUT ARMS AND LEGS
7708-296091-0006 IF THEY WANTED HELP ABOUT THEIR PENSIONS THEY WERE TOLD TO PUT IT DOWN IN WRITING AND MISS FLORENCE'S MAID CAME WITH AN ANSWER OF COURSE SHE WAS WILLING TO HELP EVERYBODY BUT IT STOOD TO REASON SHE COULD NOT RECEIVE THEM ALL WHY THE PARK WOULDN'T HAVE HELD ALL THE FOLKS THAT CAME AND BESIDES
7708-296091-0007 ALL SENSIBLE PEOPLE REALIZED HOW WEARY MISS NIGHTINGALE MUST BE AFTER HER TREMENDOUS LABORS AND HOW MUCH SHE MUST NEED REST
7708-296091-0008 SO THEY LEFT HER IN PEACE AND BEGAN SENDING HER THINGS TO SHOW THEIR GRATITUDE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THE FIRST GIFT OF THIS KIND SHE HAD RECEIVED BEFORE SHE LEFT THE CRIMEA FROM GOOD QUEEN VICTORIA HERSELF THIS WAS THE NIGHTINGALE JEWEL AS IT IS CALLED
7708-296091-0009 A RUBY RED ENAMEL CROSS ON A WHITE FIELD ENCIRCLED BY A BLACK BAND WITH THE WORDS
7708-296091-0010 THE LETTERS V R SURMOUNTED BY A CROWN IN DIAMONDS ARE IMPRESSED UPON THE CENTRE OF THE CROSS GREEN ENAMEL BRANCHES OF PALM TIPPED WITH GOLD FORM THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SHIELD WHILE AROUND THEIR STEMS IS A RIBAND OF BLUE ENAMEL
7708-296091-0011 WITH THE SINGLE WORD CRIMEA ON THE TOP ARE THREE BRILLIANT STARS OF DIAMONDS ON THE BACK IS AN INSCRIPTION WRITTEN BY THE QUEEN ANOTHER GIFT RECEIVED ON THE SCENE OF HER LABORS WAS A MAGNIFICENT DIAMOND BRACELET
7708-296091-0012 SENT HER BY THE SULTAN OF TURKEY I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY MORE JEWELS BUT TWO GIFTS THAT MISS NIGHTINGALE PRIZED HIGHLY
7708-296091-0013 EACH KNIFE BLADE INSCRIBED WITH THE WORDS PRESENTED TO FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND THE SILVER BOUND OAK CASE INLAID WITH A REPRESENTATION OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN
7708-296091-0014 AND A BEAUTIFUL PEARL INLAID WRITING DESK PRESENTED BY HER FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS NEAR LEA HURST ALL THESE THINGS WERE VERY TOUCHING STILL MORE TOUCHING WERE THE LETTERS THAT CAME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THANKING AND BLESSING HER FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE
7708-296091-0015 TRULY IT WAS A HAPPY HOME COMING MISS NIGHTINGALE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VERY VERY WEARY SHE REALIZED THAT SHE MUST HAVE A LONG REST BUT SHE LITTLE THOUGHT HOW LONG IT MUST BE SHE AND ALL HER FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT AFTER A FEW MONTHS
7708-296091-0016 AND BECOME THE ACTIVE LEADER IN INTRODUCING THE NEW METHODS OF NURSING INTO ENGLAND BUT THE MONTHS PASSED AND GREW FROM FEW TO MANY AND STILL HER STRENGTH DID NOT RETURN THE NEXT YEAR INDEED WHEN THE DREADFUL INDIAN MUTINY BROKE OUT
7708-296091-0017 SHE WROTE TO HER FRIEND LADY CANNING WIFE OF THE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF INDIA OFFERING TO COME AT TWENTY FOUR HOURS NOTICE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING TO DO IN HER LINE OF BUSINESS
7708-296091-0018 SLOWLY GRADUALLY THE TRUTH CAME TO FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE SHE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE STRONG OR WELL AGAIN ALWAYS DELICATE THE TREMENDOUS LABORS OF THE CRIMEA HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HER WHILE THE WORK WENT ON
7708-296091-0019 THE FRAIL BODY ANSWERED THE CALL OF THE POWERFUL WILL THE UNDAUNTED MIND THE GREAT HEART NOW THAT THE TASK WAS FINISHED IT SANK DOWN BROKEN AND EXHAUSTED
7708-296091-0020 TRULY SHE HAD GIVEN HER LIFE AS MUCH AS ANY SOLDIER WHO FOUGHT AND DIED IN THE TRENCHES OR ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND WHAT DID SHE DO WHEN SHE FINALLY CAME TO REALIZE THIS DID SHE GIVE UP AND SAY MY WORK ON EARTH IS DONE NOT SHE
7708-296091-0021 THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME DARK HOURS BUT THE WORLD HAS NEVER HEARD OF THEM SHE NEVER FOR AN INSTANT THOUGHT OF GIVING UP HER WORK SHE SIMPLY CHANGED THE METHODS OF IT
7708-296091-0022 VERY WELL BUT THE MIND WAS NOT TIRED AT ALL THE WILL WAS NOT WEAKENED THE HEART HAD NOT CEASED TO THROB WITH LOVE AND COMPASSION FOR THE SICK THE SORROWFUL THE SUFFERING
7708-296091-0023 THE QUESTION WAS TO FIND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY COULD WORK WITH AS LITTLE TROUBLE AS MIGHT BE TO THEIR POOR SICK FRIEND THE BODY THE WAY WAS SOON FOUND
7708-296091-0024 HER SICK ROOM BECAME ONE OF THE BUSIEST PLACES IN ALL ENGLAND
7708-296091-0025 ALL THESE MUST BE BROUGHT TO MISS NIGHTINGALE ALL THE SOLDIERS IN THE COUNTRY MUST WRITE TO HER WHENEVER THEY WANTED ANYTHING FROM A PENSION DOWN TO A WOODEN LEG TO THEIR HONOR BE IT SAID HOWEVER
7708-296091-0026 NOT A SOLDIER EVER ASKED HER FOR MONEY THE NIGHTINGALE FUND NOW NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS WAS ADMINISTERED UNDER HER ADVICE AND DIRECTION AND THE FIRST TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES ORGANIZED AND OPENED THE OLD INCAPABLE IGNORANT NURSE VANISHED
7708-296091-0027 AND THE MODERN NURSE EDUCATED METHODICAL CLEAR EYED AND CLEAR HEADED TOOK HER PLACE QUIETLY ONE OF THE GREAT CHANGES OF MODERN TIMES WAS EFFECTED AND THE HAND THAT DIRECTED IT WAS THE SAME ONE THAT WE HAVE SEEN HOLDING THE LAMP
7708-296091-0028 OR WRITING DOWN THE DYING SOLDIER'S LAST WORDS IN THE BARRACK HOSPITAL AT SCUTARI THAT SLENDER HAND WROTE BOOKS WITH ALL THE REST OF ITS WORK IN THE SICK ROOM AS IN THE HOSPITAL MISS NIGHTINGALE HAD NO TIME TO WASTE
7708-296091-0029 HER NOTES ON NURSING BECAME THE HANDBOOK OF THE NURSING REFORM AND OUGHT TO BE IN THE HANDS OF EVERY NURSE TO DAY AS IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN NOR IN THE HANDS OF NURSES ONLY
7708-296091-0030 I WISH EVERY GIRL AND EVERY BOY WHO READS THIS STORY WOULD TRY TO FIND THAT SLENDER DINGY VOLUME IN SOME LIBRARY AND READ MARK LEARN AND INWARDLY DIGEST ITS CONTENTS THEY WOULD KNOW A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN THEY DO NOW
7708-296091-0031 WELL MIGHT MISS NIGHTINGALE WRITE IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
7708-296091-0032 ONLY VARIED TO OTHER FOUR WALLS ONCE A YEAR AND I BELIEVE THERE IS NO PROSPECT BUT OF MY HEALTH BECOMING EVER WORSE AND WORSE TILL THE HOUR OF MY RELEASE BUT I HAVE NEVER CEASED DURING ONE WAKING HOUR SINCE MY RETURN TO ENGLAND FIVE YEARS AGO
7708-296091-0033 AS I DID ABROAD AND NO HOUR HAVE I GIVEN TO FRIENDSHIP OR AMUSEMENT DURING THAT TIME BUT ALL TO WORK DROP A STONE IN THE WATER AND SEE HOW THE CIRCLES SPREAD GROWING WIDER AND WIDER
7708-296091-0034 BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE MOTION YOU HAVE STARTED MUST GO ON AND ON TILL IT WHISPERS AGAINST THE PEBBLES ON THE FARTHER SHORE SO IT IS WITH A GOOD DEED OR AN EVIL ONE WE SEE ITS BEGINNING WE CANNOT SEE WHAT DISTANT SHORE IT MAY REACH
7708-296091-0035 SO NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW THE FULL AMOUNT OF GOOD THAT THIS NOBLE WOMAN HAS DONE THE SANITARY COMMISSION OF OUR OWN CIVIL WAR THE RED CROSS WHICH TO DAY COUNTS ITS WORKERS BY THOUSANDS IN EVERY PART OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD
7708-296091-0036 BOTH OWED THEIR FIRST IMPULSE TO THE PEBBLE DROPPED BY FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE EVEN HER OWN LIFE GIVEN FREELY TO SUFFERING HUMANITY
7708-296091-0037 WHERE SHE LIES TO DAY IN THE WHITE BEAUTY OF HER AGE NEARLY NINETY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE LITTLE GIRL BABY WOKE TO LIFE AMONG THE BLOSSOMS OF THE CITY OF FLOWERS MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY HAS GONE BY SINCE THE LADY WITH THE LAMP PASSED LIKE LIGHT ALONG THE CORRIDORS OF THE BARRACK HOSPITAL
7708-296091-0038 YET STILL FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE LIVES AND LOVES STILL HER THOUGHTS GO OUT IN TENDERNESS AND COMPASSION TOWARD ALL WHO ARE IN TROUBLE SORROW NEED SICKNESS OR ANY OTHER ADVERSITY
7708-296091-0039 LET US THINK OF THAT QUIET ROOM AS ONE OF THE HOLY PLACES OF THE EARTH
