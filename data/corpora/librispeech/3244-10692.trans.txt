3244-10692-0000 ASKING TO SEE HER I FOUND SHE WAS OF INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY
3244-10692-0001 SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER THIS NOUREDDIN HAS RUN THROUGH HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE HAS SOLD ALL HIS POSSESSIONS AND IS NOW REDUCED TO SELLING THE SLAVE CALLING HIM TO ME I SAID NOUREDDIN I WILL GIVE YOU TEN THOUSAND GOLD PIECES FOR YOUR SLAVE WHOM I WILL PRESENT TO THE KING
3244-10692-0002 I WILL INTEREST HIM AT THE SAME TIME IN YOUR BEHALF AND THIS WILL BE WORTH MUCH MORE TO YOU THAN WHAT EXTRA MONEY YOU MIGHT OBTAIN FROM THE MERCHANTS BAD OLD MAN HE EXCLAIMED
3244-10692-0003 THROWING HIMSELF ON ME LIKE A MADMAN HE TORE ME FROM MY HORSE BEAT ME TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND LEFT ME IN THE STATE YOUR MAJESTY SEES SO SAYING SAOUY TURNED ASIDE HIS HEAD AND WEPT BITTERLY
3244-10692-0004 THE KING'S WRATH WAS KINDLED AGAINST NOUREDDIN HE ORDERED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD TO TAKE WITH HIM FORTY MEN TO PILLAGE NOUREDDIN'S HOUSE TO RASE IT TO THE GROUND AND TO BRING NOUREDDIN AND THE SLAVE TO HIM A DOORKEEPER NAMED SANGIAR
3244-10692-0005 HEARING THIS ORDER GIVEN SLIPPED OUT OF THE KING'S APARTMENT AND HASTENED TO WARN NOUREDDIN TO TAKE FLIGHT INSTANTLY WITH THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN THEN PRESENTING HIM WITH FORTY GOLD PIECES HE DISAPPEARED BEFORE NOUREDDIN HAD TIME TO THANK HIM
3244-10692-0006 AS SOON THEN AS THE FAIR PERSIAN HAD PUT ON HER VEIL THEY FLED TOGETHER AND HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO GET OUT OF THE TOWN WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED AT THE MOUTH OF THE EUPHRATES THEY FOUND A SHIP JUST ABOUT TO START FOR BAGDAD
3244-10692-0007 THEY EMBARKED AND IMMEDIATELY THE ANCHOR WAS RAISED AND THEY SET SAIL WHEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD REACHED NOUREDDIN'S HOUSE HE CAUSED HIS SOLDIERS TO BURST OPEN THE DOOR AND TO ENTER BY FORCE BUT NO TRACE WAS TO BE FOUND OF NOUREDDIN AND HIS SLAVE
3244-10692-0008 NOR COULD THE NEIGHBOURS GIVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THEM WHEN THE KING HEARD THAT THEY HAD ESCAPED HE ISSUED A PROCLAMATION THAT A REWARD OF ONE THOUSAND GOLD PIECES WOULD BE GIVEN TO WHOEVER WOULD BRING HIM NOUREDDIN AND THE SLAVE
3244-10692-0009 BUT THAT ON THE CONTRARY WHOEVER HID THEM WOULD BE SEVERELY PUNISHED MEANWHILE NOUREDDIN AND THE FAIR PERSIAN HAD SAFELY REACHED BAGDAD
3244-10692-0010 WHEN THE VESSEL HAD COME TO AN ANCHOR THEY PAID FIVE GOLD PIECES FOR THEIR PASSAGE AND WENT ASHORE NEVER HAVING BEEN IN BAGDAD BEFORE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO SEEK A LODGING
3244-10692-0011 THEY SKIRTED A GARDEN ENCLOSED BY A HIGH WALL THE GATE WAS SHUT BUT IN FRONT OF IT WAS AN OPEN VESTIBULE WITH A SOFA ON EITHER SIDE HERE SAID NOUREDDIN LET US PASS THE NIGHT AND RECLINING ON THE SOFAS THEY SOON FELL ASLEEP
3244-10692-0012 IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WAS A VAST PAVILION WHOSE SUPERB SALOON HAD EIGHTY WINDOWS EACH WINDOW HAVING A LUSTRE
3244-10692-0013 ONLY THE DOOR KEEPER LIVED THERE

3244-10692-0015 WHEN HE CAME BACK AND SAW TWO PERSONS ASLEEP ON THE SOFAS HE WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE THEM OUT WITH BLOWS BUT DRAWING NEARER HE PERCEIVED THAT THEY WERE A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN AND BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN AND DECIDED TO AWAKE THEM BY GENTLER MEANS
3244-10692-0016 NOUREDDIN ON BEING AWOKE TOLD THE OLD MAN THAT THEY WERE STRANGERS AND MERELY WISHED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE COME WITH ME SAID SCHEIH IBRAHIM I WILL LODGE YOU BETTER AND WILL SHOW YOU A MAGNIFICENT GARDEN BELONGING TO ME

3244-10692-0018 WHILE HE WAS GONE NOUREDDIN AND THE PERSIAN WANDERED THROUGH THE GARDENS AND WENT UP THE WHITE MARBLE STAIRCASE OF THE PAVILION AS FAR AS THE LOCKED DOOR OF THE SALOON ON THE RETURN OF SCHEIH IBRAHIM
3244-10692-0019 THE PAINTINGS AND FURNITURE WERE OF ASTONISHING BEAUTY AND BETWEEN EACH WINDOW WAS A SILVER ARM HOLDING A CANDLE
3244-10692-0020 AND ALL THREE ATE TOGETHER WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED EATING NOUREDDIN ASKED THE OLD MAN TO BRING THEM A BOTTLE OF WINE

3244-10692-0025 FIRST FROM A DISTANCE THEN HE DREW NEARER AND FINALLY PUT HIS HEAD IN AT THE DOOR NOUREDDIN SEEING HIM CALLED TO HIM TO COME IN AND KEEP THEM COMPANY AT FIRST THE OLD MAN DECLINED
3244-10692-0026 BUT WAS PERSUADED TO ENTER THE ROOM TO SIT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE SOFA NEAREST THE DOOR AND AT LAST TO DRAW CLOSER AND TO SEAT HIMSELF BY THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN WHO URGED HIM SO PERSISTENTLY TO DRINK HER HEALTH THAT AT LENGTH HE YIELDED
3244-10692-0027 AND TOOK THE CUP SHE OFFERED NOW THE OLD MAN ONLY MADE A PRETENCE OF RENOUNCING WINE

3244-10692-0065 WHILE THE KING READ THE LETTER HE CHANGED COLOUR HE WOULD INSTANTLY HAVE EXECUTED THE CALIPH'S ORDER BUT FIRST HE SHOWED THE LETTER TO SAOUY WHOSE INTERESTS WERE EQUALLY AT STAKE WITH HIS OWN
3244-10692-0066 PRETENDING THAT HE WISHED TO READ IT A SECOND TIME
3244-10692-0067 UNPERCEIVED BY ANYONE HE TORE OFF THE FORMULA FROM THE TOP OF THE LETTER PUT IT TO HIS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED IT THEN TURNING TO THE KING HE SAID

3244-10692-0069 SUCH A SEVERE BASTINADO WAS FIRST ADMINISTERED TO HIM THAT HE WAS LEFT MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
3244-10692-0070 AND FED HIM ONLY ON BREAD AND WATER
3244-10692-0071 BUT DARED NOT WITHOUT THE KING'S AUTHORITY TO GAIN THIS END HE LOADED SEVERAL OF HIS OWN SLAVES WITH RICH GIFTS AND PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THEIR HEAD TO THE KING

3244-10692-0075 WENT TO THE PRISON TO FETCH NOUREDDIN WHOM HE MOUNTED ON A WRETCHED HORSE WITHOUT A SADDLE ARRIVED AT THE PALACE SAOUY WENT IN TO THE KING LEAVING NOUREDDIN IN THE SQUARE
3244-10692-0076 CALLED TO THE EXECUTIONER TO STRIKE AT ONCE THE KING HOWEVER ORDERED HIM TO DELAY NOT ONLY WAS HE JEALOUS OF SAOUY'S INTERFERENCE BUT HE HAD ANOTHER REASON A TROOP OF HORSEMEN WAS SEEN AT THAT MOMENT RIDING AT FULL GALLOP TOWARDS THE SQUARE
3244-10692-0077 BUT THIS THE KING REFUSED TO DO
3244-10692-0078 WITHOUT WHICH THE LETTER WAS USELESS HEARING A BEAUTIFUL VOICE ONE DAY IN THE WOMEN'S PART OF THE PALACE UTTERING LAMENTATIONS HE WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS THE VOICE OF THE FAIR PERSIAN
3244-10692-0079 AND ALIGHTED AT THE STEPS OF THE PALACE WHERE THE KING CAME TO GREET HIM THE VIZIR'S FIRST QUESTION WAS WHETHER NOUREDDIN WERE STILL ALIVE THE KING REPLIED THAT HE WAS AND HE WAS IMMEDIATELY LED FORTH THOUGH BOUND HAND AND FOOT
3244-10692-0080 BY THE VIZIR'S ORDERS HIS BONDS WERE IMMEDIATELY UNDONE AND SAOUY WAS TIED WITH THE SAME CORDS
3244-10692-0081 WHAT TREATMENT NOUREDDIN HAD RECEIVED
3244-10692-0082 BUT HE DECLINED TO SHED THE BLOOD OF HIS ENEMY WHO WAS FORTHWITH HANDED OVER TO THE EXECUTIONER
3244-10692-0083 BUT THIS TOO HE DECLINED SAYING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED THERE HE PREFERRED NEVER TO RETURN BUT TO ENTER THE SERVICE OF THE CALIPH HE
3244-10692-0084 AND LIVED LONG IN GREAT HAPPINESS WITH THE FAIR PERSIAN AS TO THE KING
