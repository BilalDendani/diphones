2553-163692-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE RUTH IS NOT LIKE LORNA ALTHOUGH BY OUR MOTHER'S RELUCTANT CONSENT A LARGE PART OF THE OBSTACLES BETWEEN ANNIE AND HER LOVER APPEARED TO BE REMOVED
2553-163692-0001 AS SHE SAID TO LEAVE ME TO MY OWN GOOD SENSE AND HONOUR ONLY BEGGING ME ALWAYS TO TELL HER OF MY INTENTION BEFOREHAND
2553-163692-0002 AND ON THAT ACCOUNT I PROMISED INSTEAD
2553-163692-0003 SHE WAS FULL OF PLANS FOR FETCHING LORNA IN SOME WONDERFUL MANNER OUT OF THE POWER OF THE DOONES ENTIRELY AND INTO HER OWN HANDS WHERE SHE WAS TO REMAIN FOR AT LEAST A TWELVE MONTH
2553-163692-0004 ALL MOTHER AND ANNIE COULD TEACH HER OF DAIRY BUSINESS AND FARM HOUSE LIFE AND THE BEST MODE OF PACKING BUTTER AND ALL THIS AROSE FROM MY HAPPENING TO SAY WITHOUT MEANING ANYTHING HOW THE POOR DEAR HAD LONGED FOR QUIET
2553-163692-0005 WHEN I THINK OF THY LOVING KINDNESS WARMTH AND ROMANTIC INNOCENCE AS TO STEALING MY BELOVED FROM THAT VILE GLEN DOONE THE DEED ITSELF WAS NOT IMPOSSIBLE NOR BEYOND MY DARING BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE WOULD SHE COME
2553-163692-0006 LEAVING HER OLD GRANDFATHER TO DIE WITHOUT HER TENDENCE AND EVEN IF THROUGH FEAR OF CARVER AND THAT WICKED COUNSELLOR SHE SHOULD CONSENT TO FLY WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO KEEP HER WITHOUT A REGIMENT OF SOLDIERS
2553-163692-0007 WOULD NOT THE DOONES AT ONCE RIDE FORTH TO SCOUR THE COUNTRY FOR THEIR QUEEN AND FINDING HER AS THEY MUST DO
2553-163692-0008 AS MOTHER UNWISELY HINTED
2553-163692-0009 ALTHOUGH OF INFERIOR BLOOD WHO WOULD BE DAILY AT MY ELBOW I AM NOT SURE BUT WHAT DEAR MOTHER HERSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED
2553-163692-0010 AND MY DISDAIN AND INDIGNATION AT THE MERE SUGGESTION DID NOT SO MUCH DISPLEASE HER FOR SHE ONLY SMILED AND ANSWERED WELL IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY
2553-163692-0011 THAT HIS PET SCHEME SHOULD MISCARRY HE WHO CALLED MY BOY A COWARD
2553-163692-0012 RISKING HIS LIFE DAILY THERE WITHOUT A WORD TO ANY ONE HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE FOR ALL HER MISERABLE MONEY
2553-163692-0013 SHE TURNED
2553-163692-0014 HUCKABACK HERSELF WHITE AND SAD AND LOOKING STEADILY AT MY MOTHER'S FACE WHICH BECAME AS RED AS A PLUM WHILE HER BREATH DESERTED HER
2553-163692-0015 I KNEW NOT THAT YOU REGARDED ME WITH SO MUCH CONTEMPT ON THAT ACCOUNT NEITHER HAVE YOU TOLD MY GRANDFATHER AT LEAST WITHIN MY HEARING THAT HE WAS AN INSOLENT OLD MISER WHEN I RETURN TO DULVERTON
2553-163692-0016 ANY SCHEMES YOU MAY HAVE UPON HIS PROPERTY I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO ME WHICH HAS BEEN VERY GREAT
2553-163692-0017 EXPECT I WILL ONLY ADD FOR YOUR FURTHER GUIDANCE
2553-163692-0018 SHE GAVE ME A GLANCE WHICH I SCARCELY KNEW WHAT TO DO
2553-163692-0019 UPRIGHT AS HE IS WOULD LEAVE ME WITHOUT A SHILLING
2553-163692-0020 IMPUDENT LITTLE DWARF SAID MY MOTHER RECOVERING HER BREATH AFTER EVER SO LONG OH JOHN HOW THANKFUL YOU OUGHT TO BE
2553-163692-0021 WELL I AM SURE SAID ANNIE THROWING HER ARMS AROUND POOR MOTHER
2553-163692-0022 I NEVER ADMIRED RUTH HUCKABACK HALF OR A QUARTER SO MUCH BEFORE SHE IS RARE STUFF I WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO HAVE MARRIED HER TO MORROW
2553-163692-0023 I HAD NEVER SEEN MY LORNA
2553-163692-0024 I NEVER CAN BE THANKFUL ENOUGH TO DARLING LORNA FOR SAVING ME DID YOU SEE HOW HER EYES FLASHED THAT I DID AND VERY FINE THEY WERE NOW NINE MAIDENS OUT OF TEN WOULD HAVE FEIGNED
2553-163692-0025 AND HAVE BORNE BLACK MALICE IN THEIR HEARTS COME ANNIE NOW WOULD NOT YOU HAVE DONE SO I THINK SAID ANNIE ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I CANNOT TELL YOU KNOW JOHN
2553-163692-0026 THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED AT HEARING WHAT WAS NEVER MEANT FOR ME AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST AS ANGRY WITH MYSELF AS ANYBODY
2553-163692-0027 LITTLE MAIDEN NEVER YET HAD RIGHT UPON HER SIDE
2553-163692-0028 I MIGHT HAVE SAID THE SAME THING MYSELF AND SHE WAS HARD UPON YOU MOTHER DEAR AFTER THIS WE SAID NO MORE AT LEAST ABOUT THAT MATTER AND LITTLE RUTH
2553-163692-0029 THE NEXT MORNING LEFT US IN SPITE OF ALL THAT WE COULD DO SHE VOWED AN EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP TO MY YOUNGER SISTER ELIZA BUT SHE LOOKED AT ANNIE WITH SOME RESENTMENT
2553-163692-0030 AND THEN I LEFT HER WITH JOHN FRY NOT WISHING TO BE TOO PARTICULAR AFTER ALL THE TALK ABOUT HER MONEY
2553-163692-0031 WHOSE SELF LOVE WAS OUTRAGED WITH SPIRIT I MEAN AND PROPER PRIDE AND YET WITH A GREAT ENDEAVOUR TO FORGIVE WHICH IS MESEEMS THE HARDEST OF ALL THINGS TO A WOMAN
2553-163692-0032 OUTSIDE OF HER OWN FAMILY AFTER THIS FOR ANOTHER MONTH NOTHING WORTHY OF NOTICE HAPPENED EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT I FOUND IT NEEDFUL ACCORDING TO THE STRICTEST GOOD SENSE AND HONOUR
2553-163692-0033 TO VISIT LORNA IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY DISCOURSE WITH MOTHER AND TO TELL HER ALL ABOUT IT MY BEAUTY GAVE ME ONE SWEET KISS WITH ALL HER HEART AS SHE ALWAYS DID WHEN SHE KISSED AT ALL
2553-163692-0034 AND I BEGGED FOR ONE MORE TO TAKE TO OUR MOTHER AND BEFORE LEAVING I OBTAINED IT IT IS NOT FOR ME TO TELL ALL SHE SAID EVEN SUPPOSING WHAT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ANY ONE CARED TO KNOW IT
2553-163692-0035 ALL THE CRIME AND OUTRAGE WROUGHT BY MY RECKLESS FAMILY IT EVER CAN BE MEANT FOR ME TO SETTLE DOWN TO PEACE AND COMFORT IN A SIMPLE HOUSEHOLD WITH ALL MY HEART I LONG FOR HOME ANY HOME
2553-163692-0036 TO THOSE USED TO IT WOULD SEEM A PARADISE TO ME IF ONLY FREE FROM BRAWL AND TUMULT AND SUCH AS I COULD CALL MY OWN BUT EVEN IF GOD WOULD ALLOW ME THIS IN LIEU OF MY WILD INHERITANCE
2553-163692-0037 AND NEVER WILL AGAIN
2553-163692-0038 SHE ONLY ANSWERED WITH A BRIGHT BLUSH THAT WHILE HER GRANDFATHER WAS LIVING SHE WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIM
2553-163692-0039 THIS WAS TOO PLAIN TO BE DENIED AND SEEING MY DEJECTION AT IT SHE TOLD ME BRAVELY THAT WE MUST HOPE FOR BETTER TIMES IF POSSIBLE AND ASKED HOW LONG I WOULD WAIT FOR HER
2553-163692-0040 NOT A DAY IF I HAD MY WILL I ANSWERED VERY WARMLY AT WHICH SHE TURNED AWAY CONFUSED AND WOULD NOT LOOK AT ME FOR AWHILE BUT ALL MY LIFE I WENT ON TO SAY
2553-163692-0041 IF MY FORTUNE IS SO ILL AND HOW LONG WOULD YOU WAIT FOR ME LORNA
2553-163692-0042 WITH A SMILE WHICH WAS BRIGHTER TO ME THAN THE BRIGHTEST WIT COULD BE AND NOW SHE CONTINUED YOU BOUND ME JOHN WITH A VERY BEAUTIFUL RING TO YOU AND WHEN I DARE NOT WEAR IT
2553-163692-0043 BUT I WILL BIND YOU TO ME YOU DEAREST
2553-163692-0044 WHAT A QUEER OLD THING THERE ARE SOME ANCIENT MARKS UPON IT VERY GROTESQUE AND WONDERFUL IT LOOKS LIKE A CAT IN A TREE ALMOST BUT NEVER MIND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

2553-163692-0046 GREATLY AMAZED PRAY WHAT THINKS MY LORD OF IT THAT IS WORTH FIFTY OF THE PEARL THING WHICH I GAVE YOU YOU DARLING AND THAT I WILL NOT TAKE IT FROM YOU
2553-163692-0047 THAT IS ALL I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH A GENTLEMAN' NO GENTLEMAN DEAR A YEOMAN VERY WELL A YEOMAN NOTHING TO DO WITH A YEOMAN WHO WILL NOT ACCEPT MY LOVE GAGE
2553-163692-0048 SO IF YOU PLEASE GIVE IT BACK AGAIN AND TAKE YOUR LOVELY RING BACK SHE LOOKED AT ME IN SUCH A MANNER HALF IN EARNEST HALF IN JEST AND THREE TIMES THREE IN LOVE
2553-163692-0049 THAT IN SPITE OF ALL GOOD RESOLUTIONS AND HER OWN FAINT PROTEST I WAS FORCED TO ABANDON ALL FIRM IDEAS AND KISS HER TILL SHE WAS QUITE ASHAMED AND HER HEAD HUNG ON MY BOSOM WITH THE NIGHT
2553-163692-0050 THEN I PLACED THE PEARL RING BACK ON THE SOFT ELASTIC BEND OF THE FINGER SHE HELD UP TO SCOLD ME AND ON MY OWN SMALLEST FINGER DREW THE HEAVY HOOP SHE HAD GIVEN ME
2553-163692-0051 I CONSIDERED THIS WITH SATISFACTION UNTIL MY DARLING RECOVERED HERSELF
2553-163692-0052 TO KEEP HER IF I COULD FROM CHIDING ME MISTRESS LORNA THIS IS NOT THE RING OF ANY GIANT IT IS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN A VERY ANCIENT THUMB RING
2553-163692-0053 SUCH AS ONCE IN MY FATHER'S TIME WAS PLOUGHED UP OUT OF THE GROUND IN OUR FARM AND SENT TO LEARNED DOCTORS WHO TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT BUT KEPT THE RING FOR THEIR TROUBLE I WILL ACCEPT IT
2553-163692-0054 MY OWN ONE LOVE AND IT SHALL GO TO MY GRAVE WITH ME AND SO IT SHALL UNLESS THERE BE VILLAINS WHO WOULD DARE TO ROB THE DEAD NOW I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS RING
2553-163692-0055 AND IT BECAME JOHN RIDD'S DELIGHT ALL THIS OR AT LEAST GREAT PART OF IT I TOLD MY MOTHER TRULY ACCORDING TO MY PROMISE
2553-163692-0056 AND SHE WAS GREATLY PLEASED WITH LORNA FOR HAVING BEEN SO GOOD TO ME AND FOR SPEAKING SO VERY SENSIBLY AND THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE GREAT GOLD RING
2553-163692-0057 ONLY SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN AS INDEED I MYSELF WAS THAT IT MUST HAVE BELONGED TO AN ANCIENT RACE OF GREAT CONSIDERATION AND HIGH RANK IN THEIR TIME UPON WHICH I WAS FOR TAKING IT OFF
2553-163692-0058 IT SHOULD BE DEGRADED BY A COMMON FARMER'S FINGER
2553-163692-0059 IF THE COMMON FARMER HAD WON THE GREAT LADY OF THE ANCIENT RACE WHAT WERE RINGS AND OLD WORLD TRINKETS WHEN COMPARED TO THE LIVING JEWEL BEING QUITE OF HER OPINION IN THIS
2553-163692-0060 AND LOVING THE RING WHICH HAD NO GEM IN IT AS THE TOKEN OF MY PRICELESS GEM I RESOLVED TO WEAR IT AT ANY COST EXCEPT WHEN I SHOULD BE PLOUGHING OR DOING THINGS LIKELY TO BREAK IT ALTHOUGH
