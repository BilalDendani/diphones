5460-24509-0000 BUT TROUBLED TIMES CAME AGAIN TO JERUSALEM THE GREAT EMPIRES OF BABYLON AND ASSYRIA HAD PASSED AWAY FOR EVER EXACTLY AS THE PROPHETS OF ISRAEL HAD FORETOLD BUT NEW POWERS HAD ARISEN IN THE WORLD
5460-24509-0001 AND THE GREAT NATIONS FOUGHT TOGETHER SO CONSTANTLY THAT ALL THE SMALLER COUNTRIES AND WITH THEM THE KINGDOM OF JUDAH CHANGED HANDS VERY OFTEN AT LAST ALEXANDER THE GREAT
5460-24509-0002 MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF MASTER OF ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE THEN KNOWN WORLD ALEXANDER WAS AN EVEN GREATER CONQUEROR THAN NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAD BEEN HE DID NOT TREAT THE JEWS UNKINDLY HE NEITHER
5460-24509-0003 INTERFERED WITH THEIR RELIGION NOR TOOK TREASURE FROM THEIR TEMPLE YET WHILE ALEXANDER DID GOD'S PEOPLE NO OUTWARD INJURY HIS INFLUENCE AND EXAMPLE LED THEM ASTRAY FOR ALEXANDER WAS A GREEK AND THE GREEKS
5460-24509-0004 ALTHOUGH AT THIS TIME THE CLEVEREST PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WERE A HEATHEN NATION AND AS SUCH DID MANY FOOLISH AND WICKED THINGS ALEXANDER HIMSELF OFFERED SACRIFICE TO VENUS JUPITER AND BACCHUS THE
5460-24509-0005 NEVER AGAIN WOULD GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE WILLINGLY WORSHIP FALSE GODS THEIR TROUBLES HAD CURED THEM ONCE FOR ALL OF THAT SIN BUT ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW THE GREEK RELIGION TO BE UNTRUE
5460-24509-0006 THEY BEGAN GREATLY TO ADMIRE THE GREEKS THEMSELVES AND TO TAKE THEIR OPINION ABOUT MANY THINGS WHO CAN BUILD LIKE THESE GREEKS THEY WILL HAVE SAID WHO CAN CARVE SUCH BEAUTIFUL STATUES OR PAINT SUCH BEAUTIFUL PICTURES
5460-24509-0007 EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT THEIR POETRY IS THE FINEST IN THE WORLD AND THAT THEIR BOOKS ARE THE WISEST AND PLEASANTEST TO READ AND THEN HOW WELL THEY TRAIN THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE
5460-24509-0008 THE LADS OF GREECE ARE THE STRONGEST WRESTLERS AND THE SWIFTEST RUNNERS IN THE WORLD ALL THIS WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THE JEWS FORGOT THAT MERE CLEVERNESS DOES NOT MAKE A MAN OR WOMAN GOOD
5460-24509-0009 AND THAT THE FEAR OF GOD IS THE BEGINNING OF ALL TRUE WISDOM MANY PEOPLE FORGET THIS EVEN TO DAY SO THE JEWS BEGAN TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN GREEK NAMES AND TO SEND THEM TO GREEK SCHOOLS
5460-24509-0010 AND WHAT WAS WORSE THEY PUT GREEK BOOKS INTO THEIR HANDS INSTEAD OF THE BIBLE SLOWLY BUT SURELY THIS UNHOLY LEAVEN ENTERED THE PEOPLE'S LIFE AND INFLUENCED THEIR THOUGHTS
5460-24509-0011 BUT IN SPITE OF ALL MANY JEWISH MEN AND WOMEN REMAINED FAITHFUL TO GOD THEY KEPT HIS LAWS AND READ IN HIS BOOK DAILY LOOKING ALWAYS FOR THE COMING SAVIOUR THE MESSIAH WHO WOULD RULE AND REDEEM HIS PEOPLE
5460-24509-0012 HE SET HIMSELF TO DESTROY ALL OTHER FORMS OF FAITH I AM KING ALL MY SUBJECTS SHALL THINK AS I DO HE SAID HE WAS TOLD THAT THE JEWS BELIEVED IN ONLY ONE GOD BUT
5460-24509-0013 HE CRIED WITH A SCORNFUL LAUGH YES BUT I WILL SOON ALTER THAT BEFORE THIS THERE HAD BEEN TROUBLE BETWEEN ANTIOCHUS AND THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM AND HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
5460-24509-0014 I MUST BREAK DOWN THEIR OLD IDEAS AND FORCE THEM TO DISOBEY THE LAWS OF MOSES AS THEY CALL THEM ABOVE ALL I MUST UTTERLY DESTROY THEIR BOOK THE BOOK OF THEIR LAW ONCE GONE
5460-24509-0015 THEY WILL BE EASY ENOUGH TO MANAGE SO HE SENT ONE OF HIS GENERALS TO JERUSALEM AND BADE HIM TAKE AN ARMY OF SOLDIERS AND SPEAK PEACEABLE WORDS UNTO THEM
5460-24509-0016 THE SOLDIERS KEPT QUIET UNTIL THE SABBATH DAY BUT WHILE THE JEWS WERE AT PRAYER AND UNABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THE TREACHEROUS GREEKS FELL SUDDENLY UPON THE CITY
5460-24509-0017 AND SMOTE IT VERY SORE AND DESTROYED MUCH PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THEN THESE WICKED MEN BUILT A STRONG CASTLE ON THE HILL OF ZION SO OVERLOOKING THE ENTRANCE TO THE TEMPLE THAT NO ONE COULD COME IN OR GO OUT
5460-24509-0018 WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE CASTLE BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF SORROWS SOON THE DREADFUL ORDERS OF THE HEATHEN KING WERE CRIED THROUGH THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM
5460-24509-0019 IT IS THE WILL OF ANTIOCHUS THE KING THAT ALL THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT HIS WHOLE EMPIRE SHALL WORSHIP THE SAME GODS AS HIMSELF AND SHALL DECLARE THAT HIS RELIGION ALONE IS TRUE DEATH TO ALL THOSE WHO DISOBEY
5460-24509-0020 THE JEWS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN UTTER DISMAY FOR THEY KNEW WELL THAT ANTIOCHUS HAD POWER TO KEEP HIS WORD NO MORE BURNT OFFERINGS MAY BE MADE TO THE GOD OF THE JEWS IN THE TEMPLE I FORBID THE KEEPING OF THE SABBATH
5460-24509-0021 THE JEWS LAW DECLARES THE FLESH OF SWINE TO BE UNCLEAN I COMMAND THAT ON THE ALTAR OF THE JEWISH GOD IN HIS TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM A SOW BE OFFERED IN HONOUR OF MY GOD JUPITER
5460-24509-0022 THE PRIESTS THEMSELVES SHALL BE FORCED TO EAT OF IT AS FOR THE BOOKS OF THEIR LAW DESTROY THEM UTTERLY LET NOT A WORD REMAIN IN THE WHOLE LAND PUBLISH THIS ORDER AGAINST THE BOOK
5460-24509-0023 LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH HORRIBLE AS IT SEEMS ALL THESE WICKED COMMANDS WERE CARRIED OUT A SOW WAS SLAUGHTERED ON THE ALTAR AND AN IMAGE OF JUPITER SET UP IN GOD'S HOLY TEMPLE MORE CRUEL THAN ALL
5460-24509-0024 THE BOOK OF THE LAW WAS TORN AND TRODDEN UNDERFOOT THROUGHOUT JERUSALEM AND ALL THE CITIES OF PALESTINE BANDS OF SOLDIERS WENT EVERYWHERE SEARCHING FOR COPIES OF THE SCRIPTURES TORN TO FRAGMENTS BURNT WITH FIRE
5460-24509-0025 OFTEN ALAS DRENCHED WITH THE LIFE BLOOD OF THOSE WHO LOVED THEM NOW INDEED THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE WERE IN TERRIBLE DANGER FOR THE MOST POWERFUL KING OF THE FIERCE HEATHEN WORLD WAS FIGHTING DIRECTLY AGAINST THEM O GOD
5460-24509-0026 THY HOLY TEMPLE HAVE THEY DEFILED THEY HAVE LAID JERUSALEM ON HEAPS THE BLOOD OF THY SERVANTS HAVE THEY SHED LIKE WATER ROUND ABOUT JERUSALEM AND THERE WAS NONE TO BURY THEM
5460-24509-0027 SO THE CRY WENT UP FROM THOSE FAITHFUL HEARTS WHO STILL DARED TO SERVE THE TRUE GOD THE ALTAR THE TEMPLE ITSELF WAS NOW DEFILED MADE UNCLEAN
5460-24509-0028 BUT HIS PEOPLE COULD STILL CRY TO THE LORD AND HE HEARD
5460-24509-0029 FOR THEY SHOW US WHAT THOSE SAINTS OF OLD SUFFERED RATHER THAN DENY THEIR GOD
5460-24509-0030 THEY WANDERED ABOUT IN SHEEPSKINS AND GOATSKINS BEING DESTITUTE AFFLICTED TORMENTED OF WHOM THE WORLD WAS NOT WORTHY
5460-24509-0031 IT WAS OF THESE TIMES ESPECIALLY THAT THE WRITER OF HEBREWS WAS THINKING WHEN HE PENNED THOSE WORDS SEVEN YOUNG MEN THE SONS OF ONE WOMAN WERE WITH THEIR MOTHER BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING'S OFFICER OR
5460-24509-0032 AS SOME SAY BEFORE THE KING HIMSELF FOR REFUSING TO BREAK THE LAWS OF GOD THEY WERE CRUELLY BEATEN BUT ONE OF THEM CRIED WHAT WOULDST THOU ASK OF US WE ARE READY TO DIE
5460-24509-0033 RATHER THAN TO TRANSGRESS THE LAWS OF OUR FATHERS THE TORTURERS THEREUPON SEIZED THE BRAVE FELLOW AND SO CRUELLY TORMENTED HIM THAT HE DIED HIS MOTHER AND BROTHERS BEING FORCED TO LOOK ON
5460-24509-0034 BUT THOUGH THEIR FACES GREW PALE AS DEATH AND THEY QUIVERED WITH ANGUISH TO SEE THEIR LOVED ONE SUFFER THEY GAZED STEADFASTLY AT EACH OTHER THE LORD LOOKETH UPON US THE LORD GOD HATH COMFORT IN US THEY SAID
5460-24509-0035 THEN THE SECOND SON WAS TAKEN AND BEFORE HE DIED HE CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE
5460-24509-0036 TAKEST US OUT OF THIS PRESENT LIFE BUT THE KING OF THE WORLD SHALL RAISE US UP WHO HAVE DIED FOR HIS LAWS UNTO LIFE EVERLASTING
5460-24509-0037 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE TURN OF THE YOUNGEST SON EVEN THE HEATHEN JUDGE WAS ANXIOUS TO SPARE HIM AND HE PROMISED THE LAD HONOUR AND GREAT RICHES IF HE WOULD BUT TURN FROM HIS FAITH
5460-24509-0038 WHOM WAIT YE FOR HE ASKED I WILL OBEY THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LAW THAT WAS GIVEN UNTO OUR FATHERS BY MOSES BUT THOU SHALT NOT ESCAPE THE HANDS OF GOD WE SUFFER FOR OUR SINS BUT OUR PAIN IS SHORT
5460-24509-0039 SEE I OFFER UP MY BODY AND LIFE FOR THE LAWS OF MY FATHERS BESEECHING GOD TO BE MERCIFUL TO MY NATION AND THAT THOU AT LAST MAYEST CONFESS THAT HE ALONE IS GOD
5460-24509-0040 CONFESSING THEIR SINS AND PLEADING FOR PARDON SO THE VERY FIERCENESS OF THE TRIAL PROVED A BLESSING AND THE DAYS OF TORTURE WERE FOLLOWED BY A REVIVAL OF FAITH IN GOD AND DEVOTION TO HIS SERVICE
5460-24509-0041 HAD NEVER LISTENED TO THE CUNNING TEMPTATIONS OF THE HEATHEN GREEKS
5460-24509-0042 AND HAD BROUGHT UP HIS SONS TO FOLLOW IN HIS STEPS WHEN MATTATHIAS AND HIS SONS HEARD WHAT WAS BEING DONE AT JERUSALEM THEY CLOTHED THEMSELVES IN SACKCLOTH AND WEPT PRAYING AND FASTING CONTINUALLY BESEECHING GOD TO FORGIVE HIS PEOPLE
5460-24509-0043 AND TO PUT AWAY THEIR SINS IN A LITTLE WHILE THE KING'S OFFICERS CAME TO THE HEATHEN ALTAR AT MODIN THE TOWN WHERE THE OLD PRIEST LIVED SACRIFICE TO JUPITER OUR MASTER'S GOD THEY SAID
5460-24509-0044 SACRIFICE AS ALL JEWS SHALL BE FORCED TO DO OR DIE BUT THE OLD MAN LOOKED THE GREEK STRAIGHT IN THE FACE
5460-24509-0045 AS HE SPOKE A BACKSLIDING JEW STEPPED UP TO THE ALTAR TO SACRIFICE THE OLD PRIEST'S EYES FLASHED FIRE AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD STRUCK HIM DOWN AND THE GREEK OFFICER WITH HIM
5460-24509-0046 QUIVERING WITH INDIGNATION MATTATHIAS THEN TURNED TO THE STARTLED PEOPLE WHOSOEVER LOVES GOD LET HIM FOLLOW ME AND HE TURNED AND FLED SWIFTLY THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY
5460-24509-0047 MANY FOLLOWED HIM AT ONCE OTHERS JOINED HIM LATER IN THE STRONG CAMP HE FORMED IN THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL AT LAST HE WAS AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY WONDERFUL IT IS TO READ HOW LITTLE BY LITTLE
5460-24509-0048 THIS ARMY OF GOD'S PEOPLE DROVE THE HEATHEN FROM THE CITIES OF JUDAH HOW THEY OVERTURNED THE HEATHEN ALTARS AND CAST DOWN THE IMAGES OF THE FALSE GODS
5460-24509-0049 STAINS OF HEATHEN SACRIFICES THEN TENDERLY AND REVERENTLY THEY GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THE COPIES OF THEIR SCRIPTURES WEEPING AS THEY SAW THE POOR FRAGMENTS BLACKENED WITH FIRE STAINED WITH BLOOD AND
5460-24509-0050 SCRAWLED ALL OVER WITH THE HORRIBLE FIGURES OF HEATHEN GODS AS TO DAY WE READ IN THE CLEAN WHITE PAGES OF OUR BIBLE LET US REMEMBER THIS SCENE AND OF THE TIME WHEN THOSE TORN AND BLOOD STAINED FRAGMENTS WERE
5460-24509-0051 ALL THAT REMAINED TO THE WORLD BUT THANK GOD WHEN ALL THE PIECES HAD BEEN COLLECTED TOGETHER THERE WAS PLENTY OF MATERIAL FROM WHICH TO MAKE FRESH COPIES AND NO SOONER HAD PEACE BEEN RESTORED TO THE CITY
5460-24509-0052 THAN THE SCRIBES SET TO WORK WITH EAGER LOVING CARE THE BOOK HAD BECOME DOUBLY PRECIOUS NOW ITS WRITTEN WORDS WERE INDEED SACRED FOR THE BLOOD OF MARTYRS HAD FALLEN UPON THEM
