6534-71091-0019 AND AS YEAR AFTER YEAR PASSED UNTIL HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WERE WELL STRICKEN IN YEARS PEOPLE WHO NEVER LOST INTEREST IN THE GREAT ESTATE
6534-71091-0020 NICKOLAS WAUGH WOULD BEQUEATH THE MANOR OF LUCKENOUGH HIS CHOICE FELL AT LENGTH UPON HIS ORPHAN GRANDNIECE THE BEAUTIFUL EDITH LANCE WHOM HE TOOK FROM THE CATHOLIC ORPHAN ASYLUM WHERE SHE HAD FOUND REFUGE SINCE THE DEATH OF HER PARENTS
6534-71091-0021 AND WHEN AT THE CALL OF SOCIAL DUTY SHE DID GO INTO COMPANY SHE EXERCISED A REFINING AND SUBDUING INFLUENCE INVOLUNTARY AS IT WAS POTENT YET IN THAT LOVELY FRAGILE FORM IN THAT DREAMING POETICAL SOUL
6534-71091-0022 LAY UNDEVELOPED A LATENT POWER OF HEROISM SOON TO BE AROUSED INTO ACTION DARLING OF ALL HEARTS AND EYES EDITH HAD BEEN AT HOME A YEAR
6534-71091-0023 MARYLAND AS USUAL CONTRIBUTED HER LARGE PROPORTION OF VOLUNTEERS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE COUNTRY ALL MEN CAPABLE OF BEARING ARMS RAPIDLY MUSTERED INTO COMPANIES AND HASTENED TO PUT THEMSELVES AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE GOVERNMENT
6534-71091-0024 THE LOWER COUNTIES OF MARYLAND WERE LEFT COMPARATIVELY UNPROTECTED OLD MEN WOMEN CHILDREN AND NEGROES WERE ALL THAT REMAINED IN CHARGE OF THE FARMS AND PLANTATIONS
6534-71091-0025 YET REMOTE FROM THE SCENES OF CONFLICT AND HITHERTO UNDISTURBED BY THE CONVULSIONS OF THE GREAT WORLD THEY REPOSED IN FANCIED SAFETY AND NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH UNPRECEDENTED MISFORTUNES AS THE EVILS OF THE WAR PENETRATING TO THEIR QUIET HOMES
6534-71091-0026 BUT THEIR REST OF SECURITY WAS BROKEN BY A TREMENDOUS SHOCK THE BRITISH FLEET UNDER ADMIRAL SIR A COCKBURN SUDDENLY ENTERED THE CHESAPEAKE AND THE QUIET LONELY SHORES OF THE BAY
6534-71091-0027 BECAME THE SCENE OF A WARFARE SCARCELY PARALLELED IN ATROCITY IN ANCIENT OR MODERN TIMES IF AMONG THE MARAUDING BAND OF LICENSED PIRATES AND ASSASSINS THERE WAS ONE NAME MORE DREADED MORE LOATHED AND ACCURSED THAN THE REST
6534-71091-0028 IT WAS THAT OF THE BRUTAL AND FEROCIOUS THORG THE FREQUENT LEADER OF FORAGING PARTIES THE UNSPARING DESTROYER OF WOMANHOOD INFANCY AND AGE THE JACKAL AND PURVEYOR OF ADMIRAL COCKBURN IF ANYWHERE THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN UNPROTECTED
6534-71091-0029 OR A RICH PLANTATION HOUSE ILL DEFENDED THIS JACKAL WAS SURE TO SCENT OUT THE GAME FOR HIS MASTER THE LION AND MANY WERE THE COMELY MAIDENS AND YOUTHFUL WIVES SEIZED AND CARRIED OFF BY THIS MONSTER THE PATUXENT AND THE WICOMICO
6534-71091-0030 THE INHABITANTS REPOSED IN THE FANCIED SECURITY OF THEIR ISOLATION AND UNIMPORTANCE THE BUSINESS OF LIFE WENT ON FAINTLY AND SORROWFULLY TO BE SURE BUT STILL WENT ON THE VILLAGE SHOPS AT B AND C WERE KEPT OPEN
6534-71091-0031 THOUGH TENDED CHIEFLY BY WOMEN AND BOYS
6534-71091-0032 OR PLAYED AT FORMING JUVENILE MILITARY COMPANIES THE FARMS AND PLANTATIONS WERE CULTIVATED CHIEFLY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF LADIES WHOSE HUSBANDS SONS AND BROTHERS WERE ABSENT WITH THE ARMY NO ONE THOUGHT OF DANGER TO SAINT MARY'S
6534-71091-0033 MOST TERRIBLE WAS THE AWAKENING FROM THIS DREAM OF SAFETY WHEN ON THE MORNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH OF AUGUST THE DIVISION UNDER THE COMMAND OF ADMIRAL COCKBURN THE MOST DREADED AND ABHORRED OF ALL WAS SEEN TO ENTER THE MOUTH OF THE PATUXENT
6534-71091-0034 IN FULL SAIL FOR BENEDICT NEARLY ALL THE ABLE BODIED MEN WERE ABSENT WITH THE ARMY AT THE TIME
6534-71091-0035 WOMEN INFANTS AND NEGROES A UNIVERSAL PANIC SEIZED THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOTHING OCCURRED TO THE DEFENSELESS PEOPLE BUT INSTANT FLIGHT FEMALES AND CHILDREN WERE HASTILY PUT INTO CARRIAGES THE MOST VALUABLE ITEMS OF PLATE OR MONEY HASTILY PACKED UP
6534-71091-0036 NEGROES MUSTERED AND THE WHOLE CARAVAN PUT UPON A HURRIED MARCH FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S MONTGOMERY OR OTHER UPPER COUNTIES OF THE STATE WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS THE FARMS AND PLANTATIONS WERE EVACUATED AND LEFT TO THE MERCY OF THE INVADERS
6534-71091-0037 AT SUNRISE ALL WAS NOISE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION AT LUCKENOUGH THE LAWN WAS FILLED WITH BAGGAGE WAGONS HORSES MULES COWS OXEN SHEEP SWINE
6534-71091-0038 BASKETS OF POULTRY BARRELS OF PROVISIONS BOXES OF PROPERTY AND MEN AND MAID SERVANTS HURRYING WILDLY ABOUT AMONG THEM CARRYING TRUNKS AND PARCELS LOADING CARTS TACKLING HARNESS
6534-71091-0039 MARSHALING CATTLE AND MAKING OTHER PREPARATIONS FOR A RAPID RETREAT TOWARD COMMODORE WAUGH'S PATRIMONIAL ESTATE IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY EDITH WAS PLACED UPON HER PONY AND ATTENDED BY HER OLD MAID JENNY AND HER OLD GROOM OLIVER
6534-71091-0040 COMMODORE AND MISSUS WAUGH ENTERED THE FAMILY CARRIAGE WHICH THEY PRETTY WELL FILLED UP MISSUS WAUGH'S WOMAN SAT UPON THE BOX BEHIND AND THE COMMODORE'S MAN DROVE THE COACH AND THE WHOLE FAMILY PARTY SET FORWARD ON THEIR JOURNEY
6534-71091-0041 BEFORE THEY COULD REACH MONTGOMERY SHE SHOULD PROCEED TO HAY HILL A PLANTATION NEAR THE LINE OF CHARLES COUNTY OWNED BY COLONEL FAIRLIE WHOSE YOUNG DAUGHTER FANNY RECENTLY MADE A BRIDE HAD BEEN THE SCHOOLMATE OF EDITH
6534-71091-0042 HERE AT THE FORK THE PARTY HALTED TO TAKE LEAVE COMMODORE WAUGH CALLED HIS NIECE TO RIDE UP TO THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND GAVE HER MANY MESSAGES FOR COLONEL FAIRLIE FOR FANNY AND FOR FANNY'S YOUNG BRIDEGROOM
6534-71091-0043 SO ARGUED COMMODORE WAUGH
6534-71091-0044 THIS PLEASANT ROAD RAN ALONG THE SIDE OF A PURLING BROOK UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT TREES THAT SKIRTED THE FOREST
6534-71091-0045 OR LISTENING TO THE MERRY CAROLS OF THE BIRDS OR NOTICING THE SPECKLED FISH THAT GAMBOLED THROUGH THE DARK GLIMMERING STREAM OR REVERTING TO THE SUBJECT OF HER LAST READING BUT BENEATH ALL THIS CHILDISH PLAY OF FANCY ONE GRAVE SORROWFUL THOUGHT
6534-71091-0046 LAY HEAVY UPON EDITH'S TENDER HEART IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF POOR OLD LUCKENOUGH DESERTED AT ITS UTMOST NEED TO THE RAVAGES OF THE FOE THEN CAME THE QUESTION IF IT WERE NOT POSSIBLE IN CASE OF THE HOUSE BEING ATTACKED TO SAVE IT EVEN FOR HER TO SAVE IT
6534-71091-0047 WHILE THESE THINGS WERE BREWING IN EDITH'S MIND SHE RODE SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY UNTIL AT LENGTH HER PONY STOPPED THEN SHE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE HEAVY DOWNCAST LOOKS OF HER ATTENDANTS WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED
6534-71091-0048 OH MISS EDITH DON'T ASK ME HONEY DON'T AIN'T WE DEM GOT TO GO BACK TO DE HOUSE AND STAY DAR BY OUR TWO SELVES ARTER WE SEE YOU SAFE SAID JENNY CRYING NO WHAT YOU TWO ALONE

6534-71091-0050 AN IF DE BRITISH DO COME DAR AND BURN DE HOUSE
6534-71091-0051 SOBBED JENNY NOW COMPLETELY BROKEN DOWN BY HER TERRORS
6534-71091-0052 EDITH PASSED HER SLENDER FINGERS THROUGH HER CURLS STRINGING THEM OUT AS WAS HER WAY WHEN ABSENT IN THOUGHT SHE WAS TURNING THE WHOLE MATTER OVER IN HER MIND SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY SAVE THE MANSION THOUGH THESE TWO OLD PEOPLE WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO DO SO
6534-71091-0053 ON THE CONTRARY THEIR LUDICROUS TERRORS WOULD TEND TO STIMULATE THE WANTON CRUELTY OF THE MARAUDERS TO DESTROY THEM WITH THE HOUSE EDITH SUDDENLY TOOK HER RESOLUTION AND TURNED HER HORSE'S HEAD DIRECTING HER ATTENDANTS TO FOLLOW
6534-71091-0054 ASKED HER GROOM OLIVER NOW SPEAKING FOR THE FIRST TIME BACK TO LUCKENOUGH
6534-71091-0055 BACK TO LUCKENOUGH TO GUARD THE DEAR OLD HOUSE AND TAKE CARE OF YOU TWO

6534-71091-0057 IF I MEET THE ENEMY AND SAVE THE HOUSE THEY WILL SAY THAT EDITH LANCE IS A HEROINE
6534-71091-0058 BUT IF I FAIL AND LOSE MY LIFE THEY WILL SAY THAT EDITH WAS A CRACKED BRAINED GIRL WHO DESERVED HER FATE AND THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS PREDICTED SHE WOULD COME TO A BAD END BETTER GO ON TO HAY HILL MISS EDY DEED FORE MARSTER BETTER GO TO HAY HILL
6534-71091-0059 WE WILL RETURN TO LUCKENOUGH THE ARGUMENTS OF THE OLD NEGROES WAXED FAINTER AND FEWER THEY FELT A VAGUE BUT POTENT CONFIDENCE IN EDITH AND HER ABILITIES AND A SENSE OF PROTECTION IN HER PRESENCE FROM WHICH THEY WERE LOTH TO PART
6534-71091-0060 THE SUN WAS HIGH WHEN THEY ENTERED THE FOREST SHADES AGAIN SEE SAID EDITH TO HER COMPANIONS

6534-71091-0062 SHE WAS VIOLENTLY SHOCKED OUT OF A FITFUL DOZE OLD JENNY STOOD OVER HER LIFTING HER UP SHAKING HER AND SHOUTING IN HER EARS MISS EDITH MISS EDITH THEY ARE HERE THEY ARE HERE
6534-71091-0063 IN THE ROOM STOOD OLD OLIVER GRAY WITH TERROR WHILE ALL THE DOGS ON THE PREMISES WERE BARKING MADLY AND A NOISY PARTY AT THE FRONT WAS TRYING TO FORCE AN ENTRANCE VIOLENT KNOCKING AND SHAKING AT THE OUTER DOOR AND THE SOUND OF VOICES
6534-71091-0064 OPEN OPEN LET US IN FOR GOD'S SAKE LET US IN
6534-71091-0065 THEY PLEAD THEY DO NOT THREATEN GO AND UNBAR THE DOOR OLIVER SAID EDITH RELUCTANTLY AND CAUTIOUSLY THE OLD MAN OBEYED LIGHT ANOTHER CANDLE JENNY THAT IS DYING IN ITS SOCKET IT WILL BE OUT IN A MINUTE
6534-71091-0066 BUT ONLY SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING OUT THE EXPIRING LIGHT THE SOUND OF THE UNBARRING OF THE DOOR HAD DEPRIVED HER OF THE LAST REMNANT OF SELF CONTROL
