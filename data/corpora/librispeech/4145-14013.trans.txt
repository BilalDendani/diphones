4145-14013-0025 SO EASY AND GOOD NATURED AND RICH AND GENEROUS SHE WAS SURE LINDORE DID NO CARE WHAT HIS WIFE DID SHE MIGHT GIVE WHAT PARTIES SHE PLEASED GO WHERE SHE LIKED SPEND AS MUCH MONEY AS SHE CHOSE AND HE WOULD NEVER TROUBLE HIS HEAD ABOUT THE MATTER
4145-14013-0026 SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN LADY LINDORE HAD NOT A SINGLE THING TO WISH FOR ERGO SHE MUST BE THE HAPPIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD
4145-14013-0027 ALL THIS WAS ADDRESSED TO HENRY WHO HAD HOWEVER ATTAINED THE HAPPY ART OF NOT HEARING ABOVE ONE WORD OUT OF A HUNDRED THAT HAPPENED TO FALL FROM THE ANGEL LIPS OF HIS ADORED JULIA AND HAVING FINISHED THE NEWSPAPERS

4145-14013-0029 REQUESTED SHE WOULD RETURN WITH HIM INTO THE HOUSE AS HE WISHED TO CONVERSE WITH HER UPON A SUBJECT OF SOME IMPORTANCE HE PREVAILED ON HER TO RETURN UPON CONDITION THAT HE WOULD NOT DETAIN HER ABOVE FIVE MINUTES
4145-14013-0030 WHEN SHUTTING THE DRAWING ROOM DOORS HE SAID WITH EARNESTNESS I THINK JULIA YOU WERE TALKING OF LADY LINDORE THIS MORNING OBLIGE ME BY REPEATING WHAT YOU SAID AS I WAS READING THE PAPERS AND REALLY DID NOT ATTEND MUCH TO WHAT PASSED HER LADYSHIP
4145-14013-0031 IN EXTREME SURPRISE WONDERED HOW HARRY COULD BE SO TIRESOME AND ABSURD AS TO STOP HER AIRING FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE SHE REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE SAID HOW COULD SHE IT WAS MORE THAN AN HOUR AGO
