7702-292568-0000 A RIVAL GRECIAN STATE AND THAT THREE HUNDRED MEN HAD SAVED THEIR LIVES IN FLIGHT THE NEWS WAS BROUGHT AT THE MOMENT WHEN SOME GREAT FESTIVAL WAS BEING CELEBRATED IN THE CITY
7702-292568-0001 AND THE WOMEN WERE FORBIDDEN TO MOURN BUT THE MOTHER OF EUCRATES COULD NOT AT FIRST HIDE HER GRIEF
7702-292568-0002 WHY SHOULD SHE BE SORROWFUL HER SON HAS DIED BRAVELY IF HE HAD DISGRACED HIMSELF BY FLIGHT THEN ONLY WOULD SHE HAVE THE RIGHT TO MOURN THE OLD MAN PHIDON CAME IN TO SEE HER AND FOUND HER SPINNING BUSILY ENGAGED AT HER WORK IT IS TRUE
7702-292568-0003 BUT WITH TEARS IN HER SADDENED EYES HE WAS A VERY STERN OLD MAN
7702-292568-0004 IONE HE SAID NOT ONE SINGLE TEAR SHOULD COURSE DOWN YOUR CHEEKS NOT ONE SINGLE PANG OF GRIEF SHOULD ASSAIL YOUR HEART I IT IS WHO SHOULD WEEP I IT IS WHO SHOULD MOURN
7702-292568-0005 HE LIVES AND BY LIVING HE HAS BROUGHT DISHONOUR AND SHAME ON HIS FAMILY HOW CAN I MEET HIM WHAT CAN I SAY TO HIM NAY I WILL NOT LOOK UPON HIS FACE I WILL NOT VOUCHSAFE ONE WORD OF GREETING TO HIM
7702-292568-0006 HIS FATHER WAS THE GLORY OF MY LIFE BUT HE IS THE SOUL OF ITS SHAME THE GODS HAVE BEEN CRUEL TO ME IN MY OLD AGE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN MERCIFUL TO YOU IONE FOR YOUR SON DEATH WITH HONOUR
7702-292568-0007 LIFE WITH DISHONOUR HIS FATHER WON THE CROWN OF WILD OLIVE IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND EARNED THE RIGHT OF FIGHTING BY THE KING'S SIDE AND DIED THERE AND I WAS PROUD OF HIM
7702-292568-0008 IONE KNEW WELL THAT HERE WAS A GRIEF FAR GREATER THAN HER OWN LOSS OF HER BELOVED SON SHE BRUSHED HER LAST TEAR ASIDE AND TRIED TO COMFORT OLD PHIDON
7702-292568-0009 HAD BEEN FRIENDS TOGETHER EVER SINCE THEY WERE CHILDREN AND IN THE DAYS GONE BY
7702-292568-0010 AND WOULD HEAR NO WORD OF COMFORT THOUGH AS THE DAYS WENT BY IT SEEMED TO EASE HIS STERN SPIRIT TO SIT BESIDE HER AND WATCH HER AT HER WORK
7702-292568-0011 AND URGE HIM NOT TO BE OVER HARD ON THE LAD WHEN HE RETURNED YOU MUST PARDON HIM PHIDON SHE SAID PERCHANCE HE WILL LIVE TO DO GREAT THINGS FOR SPARTA BUT THE OLD MAN SAID PROUDLY NAY IONE
7702-292568-0012 AND IT WAS IN VAIN THAT IONE PLEADED FOR THE FRIEND OF EUCRATES
7702-292568-0013 FULL OF THESE THOUGHTS AND HAUNTED BY PHIDON'S UNYIELDING SEVERITY SHE HAD A STRANGE DREAM ONE NIGHT SHE DREAMED THAT KING AGESILAUS WAS WILLING TO PARDON ALL THOSE THREE HUNDRED SOLDIERS WHO HAD FLED FROM THE FIELD OF LEUCTRA
7702-292568-0014 BUT THAT PHIDON INTERPOSED AND STANDING IN THE PUBLIC ASSEMBLY GAVE HIS VOTE AGAINST THE PARDON
7702-292568-0015 HE SAID IT MAY BE THAT YOU ARE RIGHT IONE IT MAY BE THAT THE GODS WILL YET GIVE HIM SOME GREAT AND GLORIOUS CHANCE I WILL STEEL MY HEART TO RECEIVE HIM SO IONE TRIUMPHED AT LAST
7702-292568-0016 AND TRULY HER DREAM WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF DIVINATION FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS A DECREE WAS PROPOSED BY THE KING AND PASSED IN THE ASSEMBLY TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL THOSE WHO HAD FLED FROM THE FIELD OF LEUCTRA WERE TO BE PARDONED AND RECEIVED HOME WITHOUT DISHONOUR ORDINARILY
7702-292568-0017 ALL SURVIVORS OF A DEFEAT WERE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES OF CIVIL OFFENCE AND SO THIS WAS QUITE AN UNUSUAL PROCEEDING BUT NO DOUBT IT WAS THOUGHT DANGEROUS TO TAKE STERN MEASURES AGAINST SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF SPARTAN CITIZENS WELL WHATEVER THE REASON WAS
7702-292568-0018 THERE WERE MANY GLAD HEARTS IN SPARTA THAT DAY AND OLD PHIDON HIMSELF OWNED IN SECRET TO IONE THAT HE LONGED TO SEE CALLIAS ONCE MORE FOR I MUST NEEDS FORGIVE HIM WHOLEHEARTEDLY HE SAID SINCE SPARTA HAS FORGIVEN HIM
7702-292568-0019 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY GLORY AS SOON AS NEWS HAD COME OF THE DEFEAT OF THE SPARTAN ARMY THE WHOLE REMAINING MILITARY FORCE OF SPARTA WAS SENT TO THE RESCUE AND AFTER SOME TIME RETURNED TO SPARTA BRINGING BACK THE SURVIVORS FROM THE DISASTROUS FIELD OF LEUCTRA
7702-292568-0020 BUT IONE SAT AT HOME SPINNING THERE WERE NO TEARS IN HER EYES NOW AND HER COUNTENANCE WAS LIT UP BY A CALM PRIDE SHE HAD LEARNT TO BE GLAD THAT SHE HAD NO ONE TO MEET THAT DAY SUDDENLY THE DOOR OPENED AND PHIDON CAME IN
7702-292568-0021 HIS MANNER WAS STRANGELY EXCITED
7702-292568-0022 COULD THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MISTAKE I WONDER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME A LOUD KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND IONE OPENED IT TO TIMOTHEUS A NEIGHBOUR'S SON GREETINGS TO THE MOTHER OF EUCRATES HE SAID AS HE STOOD BEFORE IONE I AM FROM LEUCTRA
7702-292568-0023 I SAW EUCRATES FIGHTING IN THE THICKEST OF THE FRAY I SAW HIM FALL AND THERE FELL ANOTHER BY HIS SIDE FIGHTING AS GALLANTLY AS HE HIS COMRADE IN DEATH AS WELL AS IN LIFE AND WHO WAS IT THAT DIED WITH MY BRAVE SON
7702-292568-0024 ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN FAREWELL HONOURED MOTHER OF EUCRATES I MUST GO AND SEEK PHIDON TO TELL HIM BUT PHIDON ROSE TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
7702-292568-0025 PHIDON HAS HEARD THE NEWS HE SAID AND HE THANKS THE GODS FOR THIS CROWNING MERCY
7702-292568-0026 THEN TURNING TO IONE HE SAID NOW WE CAN THINK OF THEM TOGETHER AND SHARE OUR PRIDE IN THEM IONE FOR ONE FLEETING MOMENT IONE SAW A VISION OF HER YOUNG FAIR SON FALLING BEFORE THE FOE
