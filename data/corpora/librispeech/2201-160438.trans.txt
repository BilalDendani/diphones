2201-160438-0000 THE GREAT COMMERCE OF EVERY CIVILIZED SOCIETY IS THAT CARRIED ON BETWEEN THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN AND THOSE OF THE COUNTRY IT CONSISTS IN THE EXCHANGE OF RUDE FOR MANUFACTURED PRODUCE EITHER IMMEDIATELY OR BY THE INTERVENTION OF MONEY
2201-160438-0001 OR OF SOME SORT OF PAPER WHICH REPRESENTS MONEY THE COUNTRY SUPPLIES THE TOWN WITH THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THE MATERIALS OF MANUFACTURE THE TOWN REPAYS THIS SUPPLY BY SENDING BACK A PART OF THE MANUFACTURED PRODUCE TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY
2201-160438-0002 THE TOWN IN WHICH THERE NEITHER IS NOR CAN BE ANY REPRODUCTION OF SUBSTANCES MAY VERY PROPERLY BE SAID TO GAIN ITS WHOLE WEALTH AND SUBSISTENCE FROM THE COUNTRY WE MUST NOT HOWEVER UPON THIS ACCOUNT IMAGINE THAT THE GAIN OF THE TOWN IS THE LOSS OF THE COUNTRY
2201-160438-0003 THE GAINS OF BOTH ARE MUTUAL AND RECIPROCAL AND THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS IN THIS AS IN ALL OTHER CASES ADVANTAGEOUS TO ALL THE DIFFERENT PERSONS EMPLOYED IN THE VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS INTO WHICH IT IS SUBDIVIDED
2201-160438-0004 THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY PURCHASE OF THE TOWN A GREATER QUANTITY OF MANUFACTURED GOODS WITH THE PRODUCE OF A MUCH SMALLER QUANTITY OF THEIR OWN LABOUR THAN THEY MUST HAVE EMPLOYED HAD THEY ATTEMPTED TO PREPARE THEM THEMSELVES
2201-160438-0005 THE TOWN AFFORDS A MARKET FOR THE SURPLUS PRODUCE OF THE COUNTRY OR WHAT IS OVER AND ABOVE THE MAINTENANCE OF THE CULTIVATORS AND IT IS THERE THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY EXCHANGE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS IN DEMAND AMONG THEM THE GREATER THE NUMBER AND REVENUE OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN
2201-160438-0006 THE MORE EXTENSIVE IS THE MARKET WHICH IT AFFORDS TO THOSE OF THE COUNTRY AND THE MORE EXTENSIVE THAT MARKET IT IS ALWAYS THE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO A GREAT NUMBER THE CORN WHICH GROWS WITHIN A MILE OF THE TOWN SELLS THERE FOR THE SAME PRICE WITH THAT WHICH COMES FROM TWENTY MILES DISTANCE
2201-160438-0007 BUT THE PRICE OF THE LATTER MUST GENERALLY NOT ONLY PAY THE EXPENSE OF RAISING IT AND BRINGING IT TO MARKET BUT AFFORD TOO THE ORDINARY PROFITS OF AGRICULTURE TO THE FARMER
2201-160438-0008 THE PROPRIETORS AND CULTIVATORS OF THE COUNTRY THEREFORE WHICH LIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE TOWN OVER AND ABOVE THE ORDINARY PROFITS OF AGRICULTURE GAIN IN THE PRICE OF WHAT THEY SELL THE WHOLE VALUE OF THE CARRIAGE OF THE LIKE PRODUCE THAT IS BROUGHT FROM MORE DISTANT PARTS
2201-160438-0009 AND THEY SAVE BESIDES THE WHOLE VALUE OF THIS CARRIAGE IN THE PRICE OF WHAT THEY BUY COMPARE THE CULTIVATION OF THE LANDS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ANY CONSIDERABLE TOWN WITH THAT OF THOSE WHICH LIE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM IT
2201-160438-0010 AMONG ALL THE ABSURD SPECULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPAGATED CONCERNING THE BALANCE OF TRADE IT HAS NEVER BEEN PRETENDED THAT EITHER THE COUNTRY LOSES BY ITS COMMERCE WITH THE TOWN OR THE TOWN BY THAT WITH THE COUNTRY WHICH MAINTAINS IT
2201-160438-0011 AS SUBSISTENCE IS IN THE NATURE OF THINGS PRIOR TO CONVENIENCY AND LUXURY SO THE INDUSTRY WHICH PROCURES THE FORMER MUST NECESSARILY BE PRIOR TO THAT WHICH MINISTERS TO THE LATTER
2201-160438-0012 THE CULTIVATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE COUNTRY THEREFORE WHICH AFFORDS SUBSISTENCE MUST NECESSARILY BE PRIOR TO THE INCREASE OF THE TOWN WHICH FURNISHES ONLY THE MEANS OF CONVENIENCY AND LUXURY
2201-160438-0013 THE TOWN INDEED MAY NOT ALWAYS DERIVE ITS WHOLE SUBSISTENCE FROM THE COUNTRY IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD OR EVEN FROM THE TERRITORY TO WHICH IT BELONGS BUT FROM VERY DISTANT COUNTRIES AND THIS THOUGH IT FORMS NO EXCEPTION FROM THE GENERAL RULE
2201-160438-0014 HAS OCCASIONED CONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS IN THE PROGRESS OF OPULENCE IN DIFFERENT AGES AND NATIONS THAT ORDER OF THINGS WHICH NECESSITY IMPOSES IN GENERAL THOUGH NOT IN EVERY PARTICULAR COUNTRY IS IN EVERY PARTICULAR COUNTRY PROMOTED BY THE NATURAL INCLINATIONS OF MAN
2201-160438-0015 IF HUMAN INSTITUTIONS HAD NEVER THWARTED THOSE NATURAL INCLINATIONS THE TOWNS COULD NOWHERE HAVE INCREASED BEYOND WHAT THE IMPROVEMENT AND CULTIVATION OF THE TERRITORY IN WHICH THEY WERE SITUATED COULD SUPPORT TILL SUCH TIME AT LEAST AS THE WHOLE OF THAT TERRITORY WAS COMPLETELY CULTIVATED AND IMPROVED
2201-160438-0016 UPON EQUAL OR NEARLY EQUAL PROFITS MOST MEN WILL CHOOSE TO EMPLOY THEIR CAPITALS RATHER IN THE IMPROVEMENT AND CULTIVATION OF LAND THAN EITHER IN MANUFACTURES OR IN FOREIGN TRADE THE MAN WHO EMPLOYS HIS CAPITAL IN LAND HAS IT MORE UNDER HIS VIEW AND COMMAND
2201-160438-0017 THE CAPITAL OF THE LANDLORD ON THE CONTRARY WHICH IS FIXED IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIS LAND SEEMS TO BE AS WELL SECURED AS THE NATURE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS CAN ADMIT OF THE BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY BESIDES THE PLEASURE OF A COUNTRY LIFE THE TRANQUILLITY OF MIND WHICH IT PROMISES
2201-160438-0018 HE SEEMS TO RETAIN A PREDILECTION FOR THIS PRIMITIVE EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF SOME ARTIFICERS INDEED THE CULTIVATION OF LAND CANNOT BE CARRIED ON BUT WITH GREAT INCONVENIENCY AND CONTINUAL INTERRUPTION SMITHS CARPENTERS
2201-160438-0019 LIKE THAT OF THE FARMER NECESSARILY TIED DOWN TO A PRECISE SPOT THEY NATURALLY SETTLE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ONE ANOTHER AND THUS FORM A SMALL TOWN OR VILLAGE THE BUTCHER THE BREWER AND THE BAKER SOON JOIN THEM TOGETHER WITH MANY OTHER ARTIFICERS AND RETAILERS
2201-160438-0020 NECESSARY OR USEFUL FOR SUPPLYING THEIR OCCASIONAL WANTS AND WHO CONTRIBUTE STILL FURTHER TO AUGMENT THE TOWN THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN AND THOSE OF THE COUNTRY ARE MUTUALLY THE SERVANTS OF ONE ANOTHER THE TOWN IS A CONTINUAL FAIR OR MARKET
2201-160438-0021 TO WHICH THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY RESORT IN ORDER TO EXCHANGE THEIR RUDE FOR MANUFACTURED PRODUCE IT IS THIS COMMERCE WHICH SUPPLIES THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN BOTH WITH THE MATERIALS OF THEIR WORK AND THE MEANS OF THEIR SUBSISTENCE
2201-160438-0022 THE QUANTITY OF THE FINISHED WORK WHICH THEY SELL TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY NECESSARILY REGULATES THE QUANTITY OF THE MATERIALS AND PROVISIONS WHICH THEY BUY NEITHER THEIR EMPLOYMENT NOR SUBSISTENCE THEREFORE CAN AUGMENT BUT IN PROPORTION TO THE AUGMENTATION OF THE DEMAND FROM THE COUNTRY FOR FINISHED WORK
2201-160438-0023 AND THIS DEMAND CAN AUGMENT ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE EXTENSION OF IMPROVEMENT AND CULTIVATION HAD HUMAN INSTITUTIONS THEREFORE NEVER DISTURBED THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS THE PROGRESSIVE WEALTH AND INCREASE OF THE TOWNS WOULD IN EVERY POLITICAL SOCIETY BE CONSEQUENTIAL
2201-160438-0024 AND IN PROPORTION TO THE IMPROVEMENT AND CULTIVATION OF THE TERRITORY OF COUNTRY IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES WHERE UNCULTIVATED LAND IS STILL TO BE HAD UPON EASY TERMS NO MANUFACTURES FOR DISTANT SALE HAVE EVER YET BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ANY OF THEIR TOWNS
2201-160438-0025 WHEN AN ARTIFICER HAS ACQUIRED A LITTLE MORE STOCK THAN IS NECESSARY FOR CARRYING ON HIS OWN BUSINESS IN SUPPLYING THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY HE DOES NOT IN NORTH AMERICA ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH WITH IT A MANUFACTURE FOR MORE DISTANT SALE
2201-160438-0026 BUT EMPLOYS IT IN THE PURCHASE AND IMPROVEMENT OF UNCULTIVATED LAND FROM ARTIFICER HE BECOMES PLANTER AND NEITHER THE LARGE WAGES NOR THE EASY SUBSISTENCE WHICH THAT COUNTRY AFFORDS TO ARTIFICERS CAN BRIBE HIM RATHER TO WORK FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAN FOR HIMSELF
2201-160438-0027 HE FEELS THAT AN ARTIFICER IS THE SERVANT OF HIS CUSTOMERS FROM WHOM HE DERIVES HIS SUBSISTENCE BUT THAT A PLANTER WHO CULTIVATES HIS OWN LAND AND DERIVES HIS NECESSARY SUBSISTENCE FROM THE LABOUR OF HIS OWN FAMILY IS REALLY A MASTER AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL THE WORLD
2201-160438-0028 IN COUNTRIES ON THE CONTRARY WHERE THERE IS EITHER NO UNCULTIVATED LAND OR NONE THAT CAN BE HAD UPON EASY TERMS EVERY ARTIFICER WHO HAS ACQUIRED MORE STOCK THAN HE CAN EMPLOY IN THE OCCASIONAL JOBS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ENDEAVOURS TO PREPARE WORK FOR MORE DISTANT SALE
2201-160438-0029 THE SMITH ERECTS SOME SORT OF IRON THE WEAVER SOME SORT OF LINEN OR WOOLLEN MANUFACTORY THOSE DIFFERENT MANUFACTURES COME IN PROCESS OF TIME TO BE GRADUALLY SUBDIVIDED AND THEREBY IMPROVED AND REFINED IN A GREAT VARIETY OF WAYS WHICH MAY EASILY BE CONCEIVED
2201-160438-0030 AND WHICH IT IS THEREFORE UNNECESSARY TO EXPLAIN ANY FARTHER IN SEEKING FOR EMPLOYMENT TO A CAPITAL MANUFACTURES ARE UPON EQUAL OR NEARLY EQUAL PROFITS NATURALLY PREFERRED TO FOREIGN COMMERCE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT AGRICULTURE IS NATURALLY PREFERRED TO MANUFACTURES
2201-160438-0031 OR THAT FOR WHICH THERE IS NO DEMAND AT HOME MUST BE SENT ABROAD IN ORDER TO BE EXCHANGED FOR SOMETHING FOR WHICH THERE IS SOME DEMAND AT HOME BUT WHETHER THE CAPITAL WHICH CARRIES THIS SURPLUS PRODUCE ABROAD BE A FOREIGN OR A DOMESTIC ONE IS OF VERY LITTLE IMPORTANCE
2201-160438-0032 IF THE SOCIETY HAS NOT ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT CAPITAL BOTH TO CULTIVATE ALL ITS LANDS AND TO MANUFACTURE IN THE COMPLETEST MANNER THE WHOLE OF ITS RUDE PRODUCE
2201-160438-0033 THOUGH THE GREATER PART OF ITS EXPORTATION TRADE BE CARRIED ON BY FOREIGNERS THE PROGRESS OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN AND WEST INDIAN COLONIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS RAPID HAD NO CAPITAL BUT WHAT BELONGED TO THEMSELVES BEEN EMPLOYED IN EXPORTING THEIR SURPLUS PRODUCE
2201-160438-0034 ACCORDING TO THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS THEREFORE THE GREATER PART OF THE CAPITAL OF EVERY GROWING SOCIETY IS FIRST DIRECTED TO AGRICULTURE AFTERWARDS TO MANUFACTURES AND LAST OF ALL TO FOREIGN COMMERCE
2201-160438-0035 THIS ORDER OF THINGS IS SO VERY NATURAL THAT IN EVERY SOCIETY THAT HAD ANY TERRITORY IT HAS ALWAYS I BELIEVE BEEN IN SOME DEGREE OBSERVED SOME OF THEIR LANDS MUST HAVE BEEN CULTIVATED BEFORE ANY CONSIDERABLE TOWNS COULD BE ESTABLISHED
2201-160438-0036 AND SOME SORT OF COARSE INDUSTRY OF THE MANUFACTURING KIND MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON IN THOSE TOWNS BEFORE THEY COULD WELL THINK OF EMPLOYING THEMSELVES IN FOREIGN COMMERCE
