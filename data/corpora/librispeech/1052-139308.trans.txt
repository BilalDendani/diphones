1052-139308-0000 THE FAINT HUMMING NOTE OF ITS EASY MOTION WAS THE ONLY CLEAR SOUND IN THAT QUIET PLACE AS THESE VANES SPRANG UP ONE AFTER THE OTHER GRAHAM COULD GET TRANSIENT GLIMPSES OF THE SKY HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE A STAR
1052-139308-0001 AND HE BEGAN TO RECALL THAT ALONG ALL THE VAST CHAMBERS AND PASSAGES HE HAD TRAVERSED WITH HOWARD HE HAD OBSERVED NO WINDOWS AT ALL HAD THERE BEEN WINDOWS THERE WERE WINDOWS ON THE STREET INDEED BUT WERE THEY FOR LIGHT OR WAS THE WHOLE CITY LIT DAY AND NIGHT FOR EVERMORE SO THAT THERE WAS NO NIGHT THERE
1052-139308-0002 AND ANOTHER THING DAWNED UPON HIM THERE WAS NO FIREPLACE IN EITHER ROOM WAS THE SEASON SUMMER AND WERE THESE MERELY SUMMER APARTMENTS OR WAS THE WHOLE CITY UNIFORMLY HEATED OR COOLED HE BECAME INTERESTED IN THESE QUESTIONS
1052-139308-0003 A CHAIR FACED THIS HE HAD A TRANSITORY IDEA THAT THESE CYLINDERS MIGHT BE BOOKS OR A MODERN SUBSTITUTE FOR BOOKS BUT AT FIRST IT DID NOT SEEM SO THE LETTERING ON THE CYLINDERS PUZZLED HIM AT FIRST SIGHT IT SEEMED LIKE RUSSIAN
1052-139308-0004 HE REMEMBERED READING A STORY WITH THAT TITLE THEN HE RECALLED THE STORY VIVIDLY ONE OF THE BEST STORIES IN THE WORLD BUT THIS THING BEFORE HIM WAS NOT A BOOK AS HE UNDERSTOOD IT HE PUZZLED OUT THE TITLES OF TWO ADJACENT CYLINDERS THE HEART OF DARKNESS HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE
1052-139308-0005 NOR THE MADONNA OF THE FUTURE NO DOUBT IF THEY WERE INDEED STORIES THEY WERE BY POST VICTORIAN AUTHORS HE PUZZLED OVER THIS PECULIAR CYLINDER FOR SOME TIME AND REPLACED IT THEN HE TURNED TO THE SQUARE APPARATUS AND EXAMINED THAT
1052-139308-0006 HE OPENED A SORT OF LID AND FOUND ONE OF THE DOUBLE CYLINDERS WITHIN AND ON THE UPPER EDGE A LITTLE STUD LIKE THE STUD OF AN ELECTRIC BELL HE PRESSED THIS AND A RAPID CLICKING BEGAN AND CEASED HE BECAME AWARE OF VOICES AND MUSIC AND NOTICED A PLAY OF COLOUR ON THE SMOOTH FRONT FACE
1052-139308-0007 HE SUDDENLY REALISED WHAT THIS MIGHT BE AND STEPPED BACK TO REGARD IT ON THE FLAT SURFACE WAS NOW A LITTLE PICTURE VERY VIVIDLY COLOURED AND IN THIS PICTURE WERE FIGURES THAT MOVED
1052-139308-0008 HIS INTEREST WAS SEIZED AT ONCE BY THE SITUATION WHICH PRESENTED A MAN PACING UP AND DOWN AND VOCIFERATING ANGRY THINGS TO A PRETTY BUT PETULANT WOMAN BOTH WERE IN THE PICTURESQUE COSTUME THAT SEEMED SO STRANGE TO GRAHAM I HAVE WORKED SAID THE MAN BUT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
1052-139308-0009 AT LAST THE MINIATURE DRAMA CAME TO AN END AND THE SQUARE FACE OF THE APPARATUS WAS BLANK AGAIN
1052-139308-0010 HE STOOD UP AND ABRUPTLY HE WAS BACK IN HIS OWN WONDERLAND THE CLEARNESS OF THE KINETOSCOPE DRAMA PASSED AND THE STRUGGLE IN THE VAST PLACE OF STREETS THE AMBIGUOUS COUNCIL THE SWIFT PHASES OF HIS WAKING HOUR CAME BACK
1052-139308-0011 THESE PEOPLE HAD SPOKEN OF THE COUNCIL WITH SUGGESTIONS OF A VAGUE UNIVERSALITY OF POWER AND THEY HAD SPOKEN OF THE SLEEPER IT HAD NOT REALLY STRUCK HIM VIVIDLY AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS THE SLEEPER HE HAD TO RECALL PRECISELY WHAT THEY HAD SAID
1052-139308-0012 HE WALKED INTO THE BEDROOM AND PEERED UP THROUGH THE QUICK INTERVALS OF THE REVOLVING FAN AS THE FAN SWEPT ROUND A DIM TURMOIL LIKE THE NOISE OF MACHINERY CAME IN RHYTHMIC EDDIES ALL ELSE WAS SILENCE
1052-139308-0013 THOUGH THE PERPETUAL DAY STILL IRRADIATED HIS APARTMENTS HE PERCEIVED THE LITTLE INTERMITTENT STRIP OF SKY WAS NOW DEEP BLUE BLACK ALMOST WITH A DUST OF LITTLE STARS HE RESUMED HIS EXAMINATION OF THE ROOMS
1052-139308-0014 AS HE DID SO IT CAME INTO HIS MIND THAT IT MUST BE THESE LITTLE APPLIANCES HAD FIXED THE LANGUAGE SO THAT IT WAS STILL CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE AFTER TWO HUNDRED YEARS THE HAPHAZARD CYLINDERS HE SUBSTITUTED DISPLAYED A MUSICAL FANTASIA
1052-139308-0015 THE MUSIC WAS UNFAMILIAR BUT THE RENDERING WAS REALISTIC AND WITH A CONTEMPORARY UNFAMILIARITY
1052-139308-0016 A DREAM SURELY THE FANCY OF A FANTASTIC VOLUPTUOUS WRITER HE BECAME INTERESTED CURIOUS THE STORY DEVELOPED WITH A FLAVOUR OF STRANGELY TWISTED SENTIMENTALITY SUDDENLY HE DID NOT LIKE IT HE LIKED IT LESS AS IT PROCEEDED
1052-139308-0017 HE HAD A REVULSION OF FEELING THESE WERE NO PICTURES NO IDEALISATIONS BUT PHOTOGRAPHED REALITIES HE WANTED NO MORE OF THE TWENTY SECOND CENTURY VENUSBERG HE FORGOT THE PART PLAYED BY THE MODEL IN NINETEENTH CENTURY ART
1052-139308-0018 AND GAVE WAY TO AN ARCHAIC INDIGNATION HE ROSE ANGRY AND HALF ASHAMED AT HIMSELF FOR WITNESSING THIS THING EVEN IN SOLITUDE
1052-139308-0019 WHEN HE ATTEMPTED NEXT DAY TO REPLACE THESE TANNHAUSER CYLINDERS BY ANOTHER PAIR HE FOUND THE APPARATUS BROKEN HE STRUCK OUT A PATH OBLIQUE TO THE ROOM AND PACED TO AND FRO STRUGGLING WITH INTOLERABLE VAST IMPRESSIONS
1052-139308-0020 WHAT HAVE THEY GOT TO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE
1052-139308-0021 THE VASTNESS OF STREET AND HOUSE HE WAS PREPARED FOR THE MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE BUT CONFLICTS IN THE CITY WAYS AND THE SYSTEMATISED SENSUALITY OF A CLASS OF RICH MEN HE THOUGHT OF BELLAMY THE HERO OF WHOSE SOCIALISTIC UTOPIA HAD SO ODDLY ANTICIPATED THIS ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
1052-139308-0022 BUT HERE WAS NO UTOPIA NO SOCIALISTIC STATE HE HAD ALREADY SEEN ENOUGH TO REALISE THAT THE ANCIENT ANTITHESIS OF LUXURY WASTE AND SENSUALITY ON THE ONE HAND AND ABJECT POVERTY ON THE OTHER STILL PREVAILED
1052-139308-0023 HE KNEW ENOUGH OF THE ESSENTIAL FACTORS OF LIFE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CORRELATION AND NOT ONLY WERE THE BUILDINGS OF THE CITY GIGANTIC AND THE CROWDS IN THE STREET GIGANTIC BUT THE VOICES HE HAD HEARD IN THE WAYS THE UNEASINESS OF HOWARD THE VERY ATMOSPHERE SPOKE OF GIGANTIC DISCONTENT
1052-139308-0024 HE PROWLED ABOUT HIS APARTMENT EXAMINING EVERYTHING AS A CAGED ANIMAL MIGHT DO HE WAS VERY TIRED WITH THAT FEVERISH EXHAUSTION THAT DOES NOT ADMIT OF REST HE LISTENED FOR LONG SPACES UNDER THE VENTILATOR TO CATCH SOME DISTANT ECHO OF THE TUMULTS HE
1052-139308-0025 FELT MUST BE PROCEEDING IN THE CITY HE BEGAN TO TALK TO HIMSELF
1052-139308-0026 THEN I AM TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD THE OLDEST INHABITANT SURELY THEY HAVEN'T REVERSED THE TENDENCY OF OUR TIME AND GONE BACK TO THE RULE OF THE OLDEST MY CLAIMS ARE INDISPUTABLE MUMBLE MUMBLE I REMEMBER THE BULGARIAN ATROCITIES AS THOUGH IT WAS YESTERDAY
1052-139308-0027 STEADY HE SAID STEADY HIS PACING BECAME MORE REGULAR THIS NEW WORLD HE SAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY BUT IT IS ALL WHY
1052-139308-0028 I SUPPOSE THEY CAN FLY AND DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS LET ME TRY AND REMEMBER JUST HOW IT BEGAN HE WAS SURPRISED AT FIRST TO FIND HOW VAGUE THE MEMORIES OF HIS FIRST THIRTY YEARS HAD BECOME HE REMEMBERED FRAGMENTS FOR THE MOST PART TRIVIAL MOMENTS THINGS OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT HE HAD OBSERVED
1052-139308-0029 OF HIS RIVALS AND FRIENDS AND BETRAYERS OF THE DECISION OF THIS ISSUE AND THAT AND THEN OF HIS LAST YEARS OF MISERY OF FLUCTUATING RESOLVES AND AT LAST OF HIS STRENUOUS STUDIES IN A LITTLE WHILE HE PERCEIVED HE HAD IT ALL AGAIN DIM PERHAPS
1052-139308-0030 LIKE METAL LONG LAID ASIDE BUT IN NO WAY DEFECTIVE OR INJURED CAPABLE OF RE POLISHING AND THE HUE OF IT WAS A DEEPENING MISERY WAS IT WORTH RE POLISHING BY A MIRACLE HE HAD BEEN LIFTED OUT OF A LIFE THAT HAD BECOME INTOLERABLE
1052-139308-0031 THE MARVEL OF HIS FATE MINGLED WITH AND IN SOME WAY MINIMISED THE MARVEL OF HIS SURVIVAL HE HAD AWAKENED TO MANKIND IT SEEMED ONLY TO BE SNATCHED AWAY INTO THIS UNACCOUNTABLE SOLITUDE HOWARD CAME REGULARLY WITH SUBTLY SUSTAINING AND NUTRITIVE FLUIDS
1052-139308-0032 HIS ENQUIRIES BECAME MORE DEFINITE AND SEARCHING HOWARD RETREATED THROUGH PROTESTS AND DIFFICULTIES THE AWAKENING WAS UNFORESEEN HE REPEATED
1052-139308-0033 THE THING IS THIS SAID GRAHAM YOU ARE AFRAID OF SOMETHING I SHALL DO IN SOME WAY I AM ARBITRATOR I MIGHT BE ARBITRATOR IT IS NOT THAT BUT YOU HAVE I MAY TELL YOU THIS MUCH
1052-139308-0034 THE AUTOMATIC INCREASE OF YOUR PROPERTY PUTS GREAT POSSIBILITIES OF INTERFERENCE IN YOUR HANDS
1052-139308-0035 BUT IT IS TOO COMPLEX WE DARE NOT SUDDENLY WHILE YOU ARE STILL HALF AWAKE IT WON'T DO SAID GRAHAM SUPPOSE IT IS AS YOU SAY WHY AM I NOT BEING CRAMMED NIGHT AND DAY WITH FACTS AND WARNINGS AND ALL THE WISDOM OF THE TIME TO FIT ME FOR MY RESPONSIBILITIES
1052-139308-0036 AM I ANY WISER NOW THAN TWO DAYS AGO IF IT IS TWO DAYS WHEN I AWOKE HOWARD PULLED HIS LIP I AM BEGINNING TO FEEL EVERY HOUR I FEEL MORE CLEARLY A SYSTEM OF CONCEALMENT OF WHICH YOU ARE THE FACE
1052-139308-0037 IS THIS COUNCIL OR COMMITTEE OR WHATEVER THEY ARE COOKING THE ACCOUNTS OF MY ESTATE IS THAT IT THAT NOTE OF SUSPICION SAID HOWARD UGH
1052-139308-0038 I AM ALIVE MAKE NO DOUBT OF IT I AM ALIVE EVERY DAY MY PULSE IS STRONGER AND MY MIND CLEARER AND MORE VIGOROUS NO MORE QUIESCENCE I AM A MAN COME BACK TO LIFE AND I WANT TO LIVE LIVE
1052-139308-0039 HOWARD'S FACE LIT WITH AN IDEA HE CAME TOWARDS GRAHAM AND SPOKE IN AN EASY CONFIDENTIAL TONE THE COUNCIL SECLUDES YOU HERE FOR YOUR GOOD YOU ARE RESTLESS NATURALLY AN ENERGETIC MAN YOU FIND IT DULL HERE
1052-139308-0040 NOW WE HAVE TREATED YOU NEGLECTFULLY THE CROWDS IN YONDER STREETS OF YOURS THAT SAID HOWARD I AM AFRAID BUT GRAHAM BEGAN PACING THE ROOM HOWARD STOOD NEAR THE DOOR WATCHING HIM
1052-139308-0041 THE IMPLICATION OF HOWARD'S SUGGESTION WAS ONLY HALF EVIDENT TO GRAHAM COMPANY SUPPOSE HE WERE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL DEMAND SOME SORT OF COMPANY
1052-139308-0042 WOULD THERE BE ANY POSSIBILITIES OF GATHERING FROM THE CONVERSATION OF THIS ADDITIONAL PERSON SOME VAGUE INKLING OF THE STRUGGLE THAT HAD BROKEN OUT SO VIVIDLY AT HIS WAKING MOMENT HE MEDITATED AGAIN
1052-139308-0043 HE TURNED ON HOWARD ABRUPTLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMPANY HOWARD RAISED HIS EYES AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
1052-139308-0044 OUR SOCIAL IDEAS HE SAID HAVE A CERTAIN INCREASED LIBERALITY PERHAPS IN COMPARISON WITH YOUR TIMES
1052-139308-0045 BY FEMININE SOCIETY FOR INSTANCE WE THINK IT NO SCANDAL WE HAVE CLEARED OUR MINDS OF FORMULAE THERE IS IN OUR CITY A CLASS A NECESSARY CLASS NO LONGER DESPISED DISCREET GRAHAM STOPPED DEAD
1052-139308-0046 IT IS A THING I SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE THOUGHT OF BEFORE BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT SO MUCH IS HAPPENING HE INDICATED THE EXTERIOR WORLD GRAHAM HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THE FIGURE OF A POSSIBLE WOMAN DOMINATED HIS MIND WITH AN INTENSE ATTRACTION
1052-139308-0047 THEN HE FLASHED INTO ANGER NO HE SHOUTED HE BEGAN STRIDING RAPIDLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM EVERYTHING YOU SAY EVERYTHING YOU DO CONVINCES ME OF SOME GREAT ISSUE IN WHICH I AM CONCERNED
1052-139308-0048 DESIRE AND INDULGENCE ARE LIFE IN A SENSE AND DEATH EXTINCTION IN MY LIFE BEFORE I SLEPT I HAD WORKED OUT THAT PITIFUL QUESTION I WILL NOT BEGIN AGAIN THERE IS A CITY A MULTITUDE AND MEANWHILE I AM HERE LIKE A RABBIT IN A BAG
1052-139308-0049 FOR NO GOOD PURPOSE I WARN YOU I WARN YOU OF THE CONSEQUENCES
1052-139308-0050 HE REALISED THAT TO THREATEN THUS MIGHT BE A DANGER TO HIMSELF HE STOPPED HOWARD STOOD REGARDING HIM WITH A CURIOUS EXPRESSION I TAKE IT THIS IS A MESSAGE TO THE COUNCIL SAID HOWARD
1052-139308-0051 GRAHAM HAD A MOMENTARY IMPULSE TO LEAP UPON THE MAN FELL OR STUN HIM IT MUST HAVE SHOWN UPON HIS FACE AT ANY RATE HOWARD'S MOVEMENT WAS QUICK
1052-139308-0052 IT WAS NOT LIKELY THEY WOULD BE LESS HUMANE YET THEY HAD CLEARED THEIR MINDS OF FORMULAE WAS HUMANITY A FORMULA AS WELL AS CHASTITY HIS IMAGINATION SET TO WORK TO SUGGEST THINGS THAT MIGHT BE DONE TO HIM
1052-139308-0053 HE RETURNED TO HIS FORMER PREOCCUPATION WITH THE COUNCIL'S POSSIBLE INTENTIONS HE BEGAN TO RECONSIDER THE DETAILS OF HOWARD'S BEHAVIOUR SINISTER GLANCES INEXPLICABLE HESITATIONS THEN FOR A TIME HIS MIND CIRCLED ABOUT THE IDEA OF ESCAPING FROM THESE ROOMS
1052-139308-0054 BUT WHITHER COULD HE ESCAPE INTO THIS VAST CROWDED WORLD HE WOULD BE WORSE OFF THAN A SAXON YEOMAN SUDDENLY DROPPED INTO NINETEENTH CENTURY LONDON AND BESIDES HOW COULD ANYONE ESCAPE FROM THESE ROOMS HOW CAN IT BENEFIT ANYONE IF HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME
1052-139308-0055 HE THOUGHT OF THE TUMULT THE GREAT SOCIAL TROUBLE OF WHICH HE WAS SO UNACCOUNTABLY THE AXIS A TEXT IRRELEVANT ENOUGH AND YET CURIOUSLY INSISTENT CAME FLOATING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF HIS MEMORY THIS ALSO A COUNCIL HAD SAID
