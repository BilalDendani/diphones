3540-163612-0000 HE ATE FOUR MEALS A DAY SLEPT TWELVE HOURS OUT OF THE TWENTY FOUR AND THE ONLY THING HE EVER DID WAS TO SHOOT AT SMALL BIRDS WITH HIS BOW AND ARROW STILL WITH ALL HIS PRACTICE HE SHOT VERY BADLY HE WAS SO FAT AND HEAVY
3540-163612-0001 AND AS HE GREW DAILY FATTER HE WAS AT LAST OBLIGED TO GIVE UP WALKING AND BE DRAGGED ABOUT IN A WHEEL CHAIR AND THE PEOPLE MADE FUN OF HIM AND GAVE HIM THE NAME OF MY LORD TUBBY NOW THE ONLY TROUBLE THAT LORD TUBBY HAD WAS ABOUT HIS SON
3540-163612-0002 WHOM HE LOVED VERY MUCH ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT IN THE LEAST ALIKE FOR THE YOUNG PRINCE WAS AS THIN AS A CUCKOO AND WHAT VEXED HIM MORE THAN ALL WAS THAT THOUGH THE YOUNG LADIES THROUGHOUT ALL HIS LANDS DID THEIR BEST TO MAKE THE PRINCE FALL IN LOVE WITH THEM HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ANY OF THEM
3540-163612-0003 AND TOLD HIS FATHER HE DID NOT WISH TO MARRY INSTEAD OF CHATTING WITH THEM IN THE DUSK HE WANDERED ABOUT THE WOODS WHISPERING TO THE MOON NO WONDER THE YOUNG LADIES THOUGHT HIM VERY ODD BUT THEY LIKED HIM ALL THE BETTER FOR THAT
3540-163612-0004 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU HIS FATHER OFTEN SAID TO HIM YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY WISH FOR A GOOD BED GOOD FOOD AND TUNS FULL OF BEER THE ONLY THING YOU WANT IN ORDER TO BECOME AS FAT AS A PIG
3540-163612-0005 IS A WIFE THAT CAN BRING YOU BROAD RICH LANDS SO MARRY AND YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY HAPPY
3540-163612-0006 BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A WOMAN THAT PLEASES ME
3540-163612-0007 MY FAITH CRIED TUBBY DO YOU WANT TO MARRY A NEGRESS AND GIVE ME GRANDCHILDREN AS UGLY AS MONKEYS AND AS STUPID AS OWLS NO FATHER NOTHING OF THE SORT BUT THERE MUST BE WOMEN SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD WHO ARE NEITHER PINK NOR WHITE
3540-163612-0008 AND I TELL YOU ONCE FOR ALL THAT I WILL NEVER MARRY UNTIL I HAVE FOUND ONE EXACTLY TO MY TASTE TWO SOME TIME AFTERWARDS IT HAPPENED THAT THE PRIOR OF THE ABBEY OF SAINT AMAND
3540-163612-0009 WITH A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN LETTER SAYING THAT THESE GOLDEN FRUIT THEN UNKNOWN IN FLANDERS CAME STRAIGHT FROM A LAND WHERE THE SUN ALWAYS SHONE THAT EVENING TUBBY AND HIS SON ATE THE GOLDEN APPLES AT SUPPER AND THOUGHT THEM DELICIOUS
3540-163612-0010 NEXT MORNING AS THE DAY DAWNED
3540-163612-0011 THEN HE WENT ALL DRESSED FOR A JOURNEY TO THE BEDSIDE OF TUBBY AND FOUND HIM SMOKING HIS FIRST PIPE FATHER HE SAID GRAVELY I HAVE COME TO BID YOU FAREWELL LAST NIGHT I DREAMED THAT I WAS WALKING IN A WOOD
3540-163612-0012 WHERE THE TREES WERE COVERED WITH GOLDEN APPLES I GATHERED ONE OF THEM AND WHEN I OPENED IT THERE CAME OUT A LOVELY PRINCESS WITH A GOLDEN SKIN THAT IS THE WIFE I WANT AND I AM GOING TO LOOK FOR HER
3540-163612-0013 THEN HE BECAME SO DIVERTED AT THE NOTION OF HIS SON MARRYING A YELLOW WOMAN AND A WOMAN SHUT UP INSIDE AN ORANGE THAT HE BURST INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER
3540-163612-0014 BUT AS HIS FATHER WENT ON LAUGHING AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF STOPPING THE YOUNG MAN TOOK HIS HAND KISSED IT TENDERLY
3540-163612-0015 HE JUMPED LIGHTLY ON HIS HORSE AND WAS A MILE FROM HOME BEFORE TUBBY HAD CEASED LAUGHING A YELLOW WIFE HE MUST BE MAD FIT FOR A STRAIT WAISTCOAT CRIED THE GOOD MAN WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK HERE QUICK BRING HIM BACK TO ME
3540-163612-0016 THE SERVANTS MOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND RODE AFTER THE PRINCE BUT AS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHICH ROAD HE HAD TAKEN THEY WENT ALL WAYS EXCEPT THE RIGHT ONE AND INSTEAD OF BRINGING HIM BACK THEY RETURNED THEMSELVES WHEN IT GREW DARK
3540-163612-0017 HE PULLED HIS HORSE INTO A WALK LIKE A PRUDENT MAN WHO KNOWS HE HAS FAR TO GO HE TRAVELLED IN THIS WAY FOR MANY WEEKS PASSING BY VILLAGES TOWNS MOUNTAINS VALLEYS AND PLAINS BUT ALWAYS PUSHING SOUTH
3540-163612-0018 WHERE EVERY DAY THE SUN SEEMED HOTTER AND MORE BRILLIANT AT LAST ONE DAY AT SUNSET
3540-163612-0019 THAT HE THOUGHT HE MUST NOW BE NEAR THE PLACE OF HIS DREAM HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT CLOSE TO THE CORNER OF A WOOD WHERE STOOD A LITTLE HUT BEFORE THE DOOR OF WHICH HIS HORSE STOPPED OF HIS OWN ACCORD AN OLD MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD WAS SITTING ON THE DOORSTEP ENJOYING THE FRESH AIR
3540-163612-0020 THE PRINCE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND ASKED LEAVE TO REST COME IN MY YOUNG FRIEND SAID THE OLD MAN MY HOUSE IS NOT LARGE BUT IT IS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD A STRANGER THE TRAVELLER ENTERED AND HIS HOST PUT BEFORE HIM A SIMPLE MEAL
3540-163612-0021 WHEN HIS HUNGER WAS SATISFIED THE OLD MAN SAID TO HIM IF I DO NOT MISTAKE YOU COME FROM FAR MAY I ASK WHERE YOU ARE GOING
3540-163612-0022 THOUGH MOST LIKELY YOU WILL LAUGH AT ME I DREAMED THAT IN THE LAND OF THE SUN THERE WAS A WOOD FULL OF ORANGE TREES AND THAT IN ONE OF THE ORANGES I SHOULD FIND A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS WHO IS TO BE MY WIFE IT IS SHE I AM SEEKING
3540-163612-0023 WHY SHOULD I LAUGH ASKED THE OLD MAN MADNESS IN YOUTH IS TRUE WISDOM GO YOUNG MAN FOLLOW YOUR DREAM
3540-163612-0024 THE WOOD THAT YOU SAW IN YOUR DREAM IS NOT FAR FROM HERE SAID THE OLD MAN IT IS IN THE DEPTH OF THE FOREST AND THIS ROAD WILL LEAD YOU THERE YOU WILL COME TO A VAST PARK SURROUNDED BY HIGH WALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK IS A CASTLE
3540-163612-0025 WHERE DWELLS A HORRIBLE WITCH WHO ALLOWS NO LIVING BEING TO ENTER THE DOORS BEHIND THE CASTLE IS THE ORANGE GROVE FOLLOW THE WALL TILL YOU COME TO A HEAVY IRON GATE DON'T TRY TO PRESS IT OPEN BUT OIL THE HINGES WITH THIS
3540-163612-0026 AND THE OLD MAN GAVE HIM A SMALL BOTTLE THE GATE WILL OPEN OF ITSELF HE CONTINUED AND A HUGE DOG WHICH GUARDS THE CASTLE WILL COME TO YOU WITH HIS MOUTH WIDE OPEN BUT JUST THROW HIM THIS OAT CAKE NEXT
3540-163612-0027 YOU WILL SEE A BAKING WOMAN LEANING OVER HER HEATED OVEN GIVE HER THIS BRUSH LASTLY YOU WILL FIND A WELL ON YOUR LEFT DO NOT FORGET TO TAKE THE CORD OF THE BUCKET AND SPREAD IT IN THE SUN WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THIS DO NOT ENTER THE CASTLE
3540-163612-0028 BUT GO ROUND IT AND ENTER THE ORANGE GROVE THEN GATHER THREE ORANGES AND GET BACK TO THE GATE AS FAST AS YOU CAN ONCE OUT OF THE GATE LEAVE THE FOREST BY THE OPPOSITE SIDE NOW ATTEND TO THIS WHATEVER HAPPENS
3540-163612-0029 DO NOT OPEN YOUR ORANGES TILL YOU REACH THE BANK OF A RIVER OR A FOUNTAIN OUT OF EACH ORANGE WILL COME A PRINCESS AND YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH YOU LIKE FOR YOUR WIFE YOUR CHOICE ONCE MADE BE VERY CAREFUL NEVER TO LEAVE YOUR BRIDE FOR AN INSTANT AND REMEMBER
3540-163612-0030 THAT THE DANGER WHICH IS MOST TO BE FEARED IS NEVER THE DANGER WE ARE MOST AFRAID OF
3540-163612-0031 AND TOOK THE ROAD HE POINTED OUT IN LESS THAN AN HOUR HE ARRIVED AT THE WALL WHICH WAS VERY HIGH INDEED HE SPRANG TO THE GROUND FASTENED HIS HORSE TO A TREE AND SOON FOUND THE IRON GATE
3540-163612-0032 THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS BOTTLE AND OILED THE HINGES WHEN THE GATE OPENED OF ITSELF AND HE SAW AN OLD CASTLE STANDING INSIDE THE PRINCE ENTERED BOLDLY INTO THE COURTYARD SUDDENLY HE HEARD FIERCE HOWLS AND A DOG AS TALL AS A DONKEY
3540-163612-0033 WITH EYES LIKE BILLIARD BALLS CAME TOWARDS HIM SHOWING HIS TEETH WHICH WERE LIKE THE PRONGS OF A FORK
3540-163612-0034 WHICH THE GREAT DOG INSTANTLY SNAPPED UP AND THE YOUNG PRINCE PASSED QUIETLY ON A FEW YARDS FURTHER HE SAW A HUGE OVEN WITH A WIDE RED HOT GAPING MOUTH A WOMAN AS TALL AS A GIANT WAS LEANING OVER THE OVEN
3540-163612-0035 THEN HE WENT ON TO THE WELL DREW UP THE CORD WHICH WAS HALF ROTTEN AND STRETCHED IT OUT IN THE SUN LASTLY HE WENT ROUND THE CASTLE AND PLUNGED INTO THE ORANGE GROVE THERE HE GATHERED THE THREE MOST BEAUTIFUL ORANGES HE COULD FIND
3540-163612-0036 AND TURNED TO GO BACK TO THE GATE BUT JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE SUN WAS DARKENED
3540-163612-0037 BAKER BAKER TAKE HIM BY HIS FEET AND THROW HIM INTO THE OVEN NO REPLIED THE BAKER A LONG TIME HAS PASSED SINCE I FIRST BEGAN TO SCOUR THIS OVEN WITH MY OWN FLESH YOU NEVER CARED TO GIVE ME A BRUSH BUT HE HAS GIVEN ME ONE
3540-163612-0038 AND HE SHALL GO IN PEACE ROPE O ROPE CRIED THE VOICE AGAIN TWINE YOURSELF ROUND HIS NECK AND STRANGLE HIM NO REPLIED THE ROPE YOU HAVE LEFT ME FOR MANY YEARS PAST TO FALL TO PIECES WITH THE DAMP

3540-163612-0041 IT IS A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE YOU LEFT ME TO RUST AND HE HAS OILED ME LET HIM GO IN PEACE
3540-163612-0042 ONCE OUTSIDE THE YOUNG ADVENTURER PUT HIS ORANGES INTO A BAG THAT HUNG FROM HIS SADDLE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE QUICKLY OUT OF THE FOREST NOW AS HE WAS LONGING TO SEE THE PRINCESSES HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO COME TO A RIVER OR A FOUNTAIN
3540-163612-0043 BUT THOUGH HE RODE FOR HOURS A RIVER OR FOUNTAIN WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN STILL HIS HEART WAS LIGHT FOR HE FELT THAT HE HAD GOT THROUGH THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF HIS TASK AND THE REST WAS EASY ABOUT MID DAY HE REACHED A SANDY PLAIN
3540-163612-0044 SCORCHING IN THE SUN HERE HE WAS SEIZED WITH DREADFUL THIRST HE TOOK HIS GOURD AND RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS BUT THE GOURD WAS EMPTY IN THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS JOY HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FILL IT HE RODE ON STRUGGLING WITH HIS SUFFERINGS
3540-163612-0045 BUT AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER HE LET HIMSELF SLIDE TO THE EARTH AND LAY DOWN BESIDE HIS HORSE HIS THROAT BURNING HIS CHEST HEAVING AND HIS HEAD GOING ROUND ALREADY
3540-163612-0046 HE FELT THAT DEATH WAS NEAR HIM WHEN HIS EYES FELL ON THE BAG WHERE THE ORANGES PEEPED OUT
3540-163612-0047 WHO HAD BRAVED SO MANY DANGERS TO WIN THE LADY OF HIS DREAMS WOULD HAVE GIVEN AT THIS MOMENT ALL THE PRINCESSES IN THE WORLD WERE THEY PINK OR GOLDEN FOR A SINGLE DROP OF WATER AH HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF ONLY THESE ORANGES WERE REAL FRUIT
3540-163612-0048 HE HAD THE STRENGTH TO LIFT HIMSELF UP AND PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS BAG HE DREW OUT AN ORANGE AND OPENED IT WITH HIS KNIFE OUT OF IT FLEW THE PRETTIEST LITTLE FEMALE CANARY THAT EVER WAS SEEN GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I AM DYING OF THIRST SAID THE GOLDEN BIRD
3540-163612-0049 SO MUCH ASTONISHED THAT HE FORGOT HIS OWN SUFFERINGS AND TO SATISFY THE BIRD HE TOOK A SECOND ORANGE AND OPENED IT WITHOUT THINKING WHAT HE WAS DOING OUT OF IT FLEW ANOTHER CANARY AND SHE TOO BEGAN TO CRY I AM DYING OF THIRST GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK
3540-163612-0050 THEN TUBBY'S SON SAW HIS FOLLY AND WHILE THE TWO CANARIES FLEW AWAY HE SANK ON THE GROUND WHERE EXHAUSTED BY HIS LAST EFFORT HE LAY UNCONSCIOUS
3540-163612-0051 HE HAD A PLEASANT FEELING OF FRESHNESS ALL ABOUT HIM IT WAS NIGHT THE SKY WAS SPARKLING WITH STARS AND THE EARTH WAS COVERED WITH A HEAVY DEW THE TRAVELLER HAVING RECOVERED MOUNTED HIS HORSE
3540-163612-0052 AND AT THE FIRST STREAK OF DAWN HE SAW A STREAM DANCING IN FRONT OF HIM AND STOOPED DOWN AND DRANK HIS FILL HE HARDLY HAD COURAGE TO OPEN HIS LAST ORANGE THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD DISOBEYED THE ORDERS OF THE OLD MAN
3540-163612-0053 PERHAPS HIS TERRIBLE THIRST WAS A TRICK OF THE CUNNING WITCH AND SUPPOSE EVEN THOUGH HE OPENED THE ORANGE ON THE BANKS OF THE STREAM THAT HE DID NOT FIND IN IT THE PRINCESS THAT HE SOUGHT HE TOOK HIS KNIFE AND CUT IT OPEN
3540-163612-0054 ALAS OUT OF IT FLEW A LITTLE CANARY JUST LIKE THE OTHERS WHO CRIED I AM THIRSTY GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK
3540-163612-0055 HOWEVER HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO LET THIS BIRD FLY AWAY SO HE TOOK UP SOME WATER IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND HELD IT TO ITS BEAK SCARCELY HAD THE CANARY DRUNK WHEN SHE BECAME A BEAUTIFUL GIRL TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A POPLAR TREE WITH BLACK EYES AND A GOLDEN SKIN
3540-163612-0056 ON HER SIDE SHE SEEMED QUITE BEWILDERED BUT SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH HAPPY EYES AND WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF HER DELIVERER HE ASKED HER NAME SHE ANSWERED
3540-163612-0057 SHE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND FOR TEN YEARS OF THAT TIME THE WITCH HAD KEPT HER SHUT UP IN AN ORANGE IN THE SHAPE OF A CANARY WELL THEN MY CHARMING ZIZI SAID THE YOUNG PRINCE WHO WAS LONGING TO MARRY HER LET US RIDE AWAY QUICKLY
3540-163612-0058 SO AS TO ESCAPE FROM THE WICKED WITCH BUT ZIZI WISHED TO KNOW WHERE HE MEANT TO TAKE HER TO MY FATHER'S CASTLE HE SAID HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND TOOK HER IN FRONT OF HIM AND HOLDING HER CAREFULLY IN HIS ARMS THEY BEGAN THEIR JOURNEY
3540-163612-0059 AND IN PASSING THROUGH MOUNTAINS VALLEYS AND TOWNS SHE ASKED A THOUSAND QUESTIONS
3540-163612-0060 IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL TO TEACH THOSE ONE LOVES ONCE SHE INQUIRED WHAT THE GIRLS IN HIS COUNTRY WERE LIKE THEY ARE PINK AND WHITE HE REPLIED AND THEIR EYES ARE BLUE DO YOU LIKE BLUE EYES SAID THE PRINCESS
3540-163612-0061 SO HE DID NOT ANSWER AND NO DOUBT WENT ON THE PRINCESS ONE OF THEM IS YOUR INTENDED BRIDE STILL HE WAS SILENT AND ZIZI DREW HERSELF UP PROUDLY NO HE SAID AT LAST
3540-163612-0062 NONE OF THE GIRLS OF MY OWN COUNTRY ARE BEAUTIFUL IN MY EYES AND THAT IS WHY I CAME TO LOOK FOR A WIFE IN THE LAND OF THE SUN WAS I WRONG MY LOVELY ZIZI THIS TIME IT WAS ZIZI'S TURN TO BE SILENT
3540-163612-0063 WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT FOUR STONE THROWS FROM THE GATES THEY DISMOUNTED IN THE FOREST BY THE EDGE OF A FOUNTAIN MY DEAR ZIZI SAID TUBBY'S SON WE CANNOT PRESENT OURSELVES BEFORE MY FATHER LIKE TWO COMMON PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME BACK FROM A WALK WE MUST ENTER THE CASTLE WITH MORE CEREMONY
3540-163612-0064 WAIT FOR ME HERE AND IN AN HOUR I WILL RETURN WITH CARRIAGES AND HORSES FIT FOR A PRINCESS DON'T BE LONG REPLIED ZIZI AND SHE WATCHED HIM GO WITH WISTFUL EYES WHEN SHE WAS LEFT BY HERSELF THE POOR GIRL BEGAN TO FEEL AFRAID
3540-163612-0065 SHE WAS ALONE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE AND IN THE MIDDLE OF A THICK FOREST SUDDENLY SHE HEARD A NOISE AMONG THE TREES FEARING LEST IT SHOULD BE A WOLF SHE HID HERSELF IN THE HOLLOW TRUNK OF A WILLOW TREE WHICH HUNG OVER THE FOUNTAIN
3540-163612-0066 IT WAS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD HER ALTOGETHER BUT SHE PEEPED OUT AND HER PRETTY HEAD WAS REFLECTED IN THE CLEAR WATER THEN THERE APPEARED NOT A WOLF BUT A CREATURE QUITE AS WICKED AND QUITE AS UGLY LET US SEE WHO THIS CREATURE WAS
3540-163612-0067 NOT FAR FROM THE FOUNTAIN THERE LIVED A FAMILY OF BRICKLAYERS NOW FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE THIS TIME THE FATHER IN WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST FOUND A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN DESERTED BY THE GYPSIES HE CARRIED HER HOME TO HIS WIFE
3540-163612-0068 AND THE GOOD WOMAN WAS SORRY FOR HER AND BROUGHT HER UP WITH HER OWN SONS AS SHE GREW OLDER THE LITTLE GYPSY BECAME MUCH MORE REMARKABLE FOR STRENGTH AND CUNNING THAN FOR SENSE OR BEAUTY SHE HAD A LOW FOREHEAD A FLAT NOSE THICK LIPS
3540-163612-0069 COARSE HAIR AND A SKIN NOT GOLDEN LIKE THAT OF ZIZI
3540-163612-0070 AS SHE WAS ALWAYS BEING TEASED ABOUT HER COMPLEXION SHE GOT AS NOISY AND CROSS AS A TITMOUSE SO THEY USED TO CALL HER TITTY TITTY WAS OFTEN SENT BY THE BRICKLAYER TO FETCH WATER FROM THE FOUNTAIN AND AS SHE WAS VERY PROUD AND LAZY
3540-163612-0071 THE GYPSY DISLIKED THIS VERY MUCH IT WAS SHE WHO HAD FRIGHTENED ZIZI BY APPEARING WITH HER PITCHER ON HER SHOULDER JUST AS SHE WAS STOOPING TO FILL IT SHE SAW REFLECTED IN THE WATER THE LOVELY IMAGE OF THE PRINCESS WHAT A PRETTY FACE SHE EXCLAIMED
3540-163612-0072 WHY IT MUST BE MINE HOW IN THE WORLD CAN THEY CALL ME UGLY I AM CERTAINLY MUCH TOO PRETTY TO BE THEIR WATER CARRIER SO SAYING SHE BROKE HER PITCHER AND WENT HOME WHERE IS YOUR PITCHER ASKED THE BRICKLAYER
3540-163612-0073 WELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE PITCHER MAY GO MANY TIMES TO THE WELL BUT AT LAST IT IS BROKEN WELL HERE IS A BUCKET THAT WILL NOT BREAK
3540-163612-0074 NO I DON'T MEAN TO BE A BEAST OF BURDEN ANY LONGER AND SHE FLUNG THE BUCKET SO HIGH IN THE AIR THAT IT STUCK IN THE BRANCHES OF AN OAK I MET A WOLF SHE TOLD THE BRICKLAYER AND I BROKE THE BUCKET ACROSS HIS NOSE
3540-163612-0075 THE BRICKLAYER ASKED HER NO MORE QUESTIONS BUT TOOK DOWN A BROOM AND GAVE HER SUCH A BEATING THAT HER PRIDE WAS HUMBLED A LITTLE
3540-163612-0076 IF YOU DON'T BRING IT BACK FULL YOUR BONES SHALL SUFFER FOR IT
3540-163612-0077 TITTY WENT OFF RUBBING HER SIDES BUT THIS TIME SHE DID NOT DARE TO DISOBEY AND IN A VERY BAD TEMPER STOOPED DOWN OVER THE WELL IT WAS NOT AT ALL EASY TO FILL THE MILK CAN WHICH WAS LARGE AND ROUND IT WOULD NOT GO DOWN INTO THE WELL
3540-163612-0078 AND THE GYPSY HAD TO TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN AT LAST HER ARMS GREW SO TIRED THAT WHEN SHE DID MANAGE TO GET THE CAN PROPERLY UNDER THE WATER SHE HAD NO STRENGTH TO PULL IT UP AND IT ROLLED TO THE BOTTOM ON SEEING THE CAN DISAPPEAR
3540-163612-0079 SHE MADE SUCH A MISERABLE FACE THAT ZIZI WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HER ALL THIS TIME BURST INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER TITTY TURNED ROUND AND PERCEIVED THE MISTAKE SHE HAD MADE AND SHE FELT SO ANGRY THAT SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO BE REVENGED AT ONCE
3540-163612-0080 WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE YOU LOVELY CREATURE SHE SAID TO ZIZI I AM WAITING FOR MY LOVER ZIZI REPLIED AND THEN WITH A SIMPLICITY QUITE NATURAL IN A GIRL WHO SO LATELY HAD BEEN A CANARY SHE TOLD ALL HER STORY
3540-163612-0081 THE GYPSY HAD OFTEN SEEN THE YOUNG PRINCE PASS BY WITH HIS GUN ON HIS SHOULDER WHEN HE WAS GOING AFTER CROWS SHE WAS TOO UGLY AND RAGGED FOR HIM EVER TO HAVE NOTICED HER BUT TITTY ON HER SIDE HAD ADMIRED HIM THOUGH SHE THOUGHT HE MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN A LITTLE FATTER
3540-163612-0082 DEAR DEAR SHE SAID TO HERSELF SO HE LIKES YELLOW WOMEN WHY I AM YELLOW TOO AND IF I COULD ONLY THINK OF A WAY IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE DID THINK OF IT
3540-163612-0083 THEY ARE COMING WITH GREAT POMP TO FETCH YOU AND YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO SHOW YOURSELF TO SO MANY FINE LORDS AND LADIES WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN LIKE THAT GET DOWN AT ONCE MY POOR CHILD AND LET ME DRESS YOUR HAIR FOR YOU THE INNOCENT ZIZI CAME DOWN AT ONCE
3540-163612-0084 AND STOOD BY TITTY THE GYPSY BEGAN TO COMB HER LONG BROWN LOCKS WHEN SUDDENLY SHE DREW A PIN FROM HER STAYS AND JUST AS THE TITMOUSE DIGS ITS BEAK INTO THE HEADS OF LINNETS AND LARKS TITTY DUG THE PIN INTO THE HEAD OF ZIZI
3540-163612-0085 NO SOONER DID ZIZI FEEL THE PRICK OF THE PIN THAN SHE BECAME A BIRD AGAIN AND SPREADING HER WINGS SHE FLEW AWAY THAT WAS NEATLY DONE SAID THE GYPSY THE PRINCE WILL BE CLEVER IF HE FINDS HIS BRIDE AND ARRANGING HER DRESS
3540-163612-0086 MEANWHILE THE PRINCE WAS COMING AS FAST AS HIS HORSE COULD CARRY HIM HE WAS SO IMPATIENT THAT HE WAS ALWAYS FULL FIFTY YARDS IN FRONT OF THE LORDS AND LADIES SENT BY TUBBY TO BRING BACK ZIZI AT THE SIGHT OF THE HIDEOUS GYPSY
3540-163612-0087 HE WAS STRUCK DUMB WITH SURPRISE AND HORROR AH ME SAID TITTY SO YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR POOR ZIZI WHILE YOU WERE AWAY THE WICKED WITCH CAME AND TURNED ME INTO THIS BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE THE COURAGE TO MARRY ME I SHALL GET BACK MY BEAUTY
3540-163612-0088 AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
3540-163612-0089 POOR GIRL HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF IT IS NOT HER FAULT AFTER ALL THAT SHE HAS GROWN SO UGLY IT IS MINE OH WHY DID I NOT FOLLOW THE OLD MAN'S ADVICE WHY DID I LEAVE HER ALONE AND BESIDES IT DEPENDS ON ME TO BREAK THE SPELL
3540-163612-0090 AND I LOVE HER TOO MUCH TO LET HER REMAIN LIKE THIS SO HE PRESENTED THE GYPSY TO THE LORDS AND LADIES OF THE COURT EXPLAINING TO THEM THE TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE THEY ALL PRETENDED TO BELIEVE IT
3540-163612-0091 AND THE LADIES AT ONCE PUT ON THE FALSE PRINCESS THE RICH DRESSES THEY HAD BROUGHT FOR ZIZI SHE WAS THEN PERCHED ON THE TOP OF A MAGNIFICENT AMBLING PALFREY AND THEY SET FORTH TO THE CASTLE BUT UNLUCKILY THE RICH DRESS AND JEWELS ONLY MADE TITTY LOOK UGLIER STILL
3540-163612-0092 BELLS WERE PEALING CHIMES RINGING AND THE PEOPLE FILLING THE STREETS AND STANDING AT THEIR DOORS TO WATCH THE PROCESSION GO BY AND THEY COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THEIR EYES AS THEY SAW WHAT A STRANGE BRIDE THEIR PRINCE HAD CHOSEN IN ORDER TO DO HER MORE HONOUR
3540-163612-0093 TUBBY CAME TO MEET HER AT THE FOOT OF THE GREAT MARBLE STAIRCASE AT THE SIGHT OF THE HIDEOUS CREATURE HE ALMOST FELL BACKWARDS WHAT HE CRIED IS THIS THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY
3540-163612-0094 BUT SHE HAS BEEN BEWITCHED BY A WICKED SORCERESS AND WILL NOT REGAIN HER BEAUTY UNTIL SHE IS MY WIFE DOES SHE SAY SO WELL IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY DRINK COLD WATER AND THINK IT BACON THE UNHAPPY TUBBY ANSWERED CROSSLY
3540-163612-0095 BUT ALL THE SAME AS HE ADORED HIS SON HE GAVE THE GYPSY HIS HAND AND LED HER TO THE GREAT HALL WHERE THE BRIDAL FEAST WAS SPREAD
3540-163612-0096 THE FEAST WAS EXCELLENT BUT DESIRE HARDLY TOUCHED ANYTHING HOWEVER TO MAKE UP THE OTHER GUESTS ATE GREEDILY AND AS FOR TUBBY NOTHING EVER TOOK AWAY HIS APPETITE WHEN THE MOMENT ARRIVED TO SERVE THE ROAST GOOSE
3540-163612-0097 THERE WAS A PAUSE AND TUBBY TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO LAY DOWN HIS KNIFE AND FORK FOR A LITTLE BUT AS THE GOOSE GAVE NO SIGN OF APPEARING HE SENT HIS HEAD CARVER TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS THE MATTER IN THE KITCHEN NOW THIS WAS WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHILE THE GOOSE WAS TURNING ON THE SPIT
3540-163612-0098 GOOD MORNING MY FINE COOK SHE SAID IN A SILVERY VOICE TO THE MAN WHO WAS WATCHING THE ROAST GOOD MORNING LOVELY GOLDEN BIRD REPLIED THE CHIEF OF THE SCULLIONS WHO HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP I PRAY THAT HEAVEN MAY SEND YOU TO SLEEP SAID THE GOLDEN BIRD
3540-163612-0099 AND THAT THE GOOSE MAY BURN SO THAT THERE MAY BE NONE LEFT FOR TITTY AND INSTANTLY THE CHIEF OF THE SCULLIONS FELL FAST ASLEEP AND THE GOOSE WAS BURNT TO A CINDER WHEN HE AWOKE
3540-163612-0100 HE WAS HORRIFIED AND GAVE ORDERS TO PLUCK ANOTHER GOOSE TO STUFF IT WITH CHESTNUTS AND PUT IT ON THE SPIT WHILE IT WAS BROWNING AT THE FIRE TUBBY INQUIRED FOR HIS GOOSE A SECOND TIME THE MASTER COOK HIMSELF MOUNTED TO THE HALL TO MAKE HIS EXCUSES
3540-163612-0101 AND TO BEG HIS LORD TO HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE TUBBY SHOWED HIS PATIENCE BY ABUSING HIS SON AS IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH HE GRUMBLED BETWEEN HIS TEETH THAT THE BOY SHOULD PICK UP A HAG WITHOUT A PENNY BUT THE GOOSE MUST GO AND BURN NOW
3540-163612-0102 THE GOLDEN BIRD CAME AGAIN TO PERCH ON THE WINDOW SILL AND CALLED IN HIS CLEAR VOICE TO THE HEAD SCULLION WHO WAS WATCHING THE SPIT GOOD MORNING MY FINE SCULLION GOOD MORNING LOVELY GOLDEN BIRD REPLIED THE SCULLION WHOM THE MASTER COOK HAD FORGOTTEN IN HIS EXCITEMENT TO WARN
3540-163612-0103 I PRAY HEAVEN WENT ON THE CANARY
3540-163612-0104 AND THAT THE GOOSE MAY BURN SO THAT THERE MAY BE NONE LEFT FOR TITTY AND THE SCULLION FELL FAST ASLEEP AND WHEN THE MASTER COOK CAME BACK HE FOUND THE GOOSE AS BLACK AS THE CHIMNEY IN A FURY HE WOKE THE SCULLION WHO IN ORDER TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM BLAME TOLD THE WHOLE STORY
3540-163612-0105 IT WILL END BY GETTING ME SENT AWAY COME SOME OF YOU AND HIDE YOURSELVES AND IF IT COMES AGAIN CATCH IT AND WRING ITS NECK HE SPITTED A THIRD GOOSE LIT A HUGE FIRE AND SEATED HIMSELF BY IT
3540-163612-0106 THE BIRD APPEARED A THIRD TIME AND SAID GOOD MORNING MY FINE COOK GOOD MORNING LOVELY GOLDEN BIRD REPLIED THE COOK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED AND AT THE MOMENT THAT THE CANARY WAS BEGINNING I PRAY HEAVEN THAT IT MAY SEND
3540-163612-0107 A SCULLION WHO WAS HIDDEN OUTSIDE RUSHED OUT AND SHUT THE SHUTTERS THE BIRD FLEW INTO THE KITCHEN THEN ALL THE COOKS AND SCULLIONS SPRANG AFTER IT KNOCKING AT IT WITH THEIR APRONS AT LENGTH ONE OF THEM CAUGHT IT JUST AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT TUBBY ENTERED THE KITCHEN
3540-163612-0108 WAVING HIS SCEPTRE HE HAD COME TO SEE FOR HIMSELF WHY THE GOOSE HAD NEVER MADE ITS APPEARANCE THE SCULLION STOPPED AT ONCE JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO WRING THE CANARY'S NECK
3540-163612-0109 YOUR EXCELLENCY IT IS THE BIRD REPLIED THE SCULLION AND HE PLACED IT IN HIS HAND
3540-163612-0110 AND IN STROKING ITS HEAD HE TOUCHED A PIN THAT WAS STICKING BETWEEN ITS FEATHERS HE PULLED IT OUT AND LO THE CANARY AT ONCE BECAME A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WITH A GOLDEN SKIN WHO JUMPED LIGHTLY TO THE GROUND GRACIOUS WHAT A PRETTY GIRL SAID TUBBY
3540-163612-0111 AND HE TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS CRYING MY DARLING ZIZI HOW HAPPY I AM TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE WELL AND THE OTHER ONE ASKED TUBBY THE OTHER ONE WAS STEALING QUIETLY TO THE DOOR STOP HER CALLED TUBBY
3540-163612-0112 WE WILL JUDGE HER CAUSE AT ONCE AND HE SEATED HIMSELF SOLEMNLY ON THE OVEN AND CONDEMNED TITTY TO BE BURNED ALIVE
3540-163612-0113 ALL THE BOYS IN THE COUNTRY SIDE WERE THERE ARMED WITH WOODEN SWORDS AND DECORATED WITH EPAULETS MADE OF GILT PAPER ZIZI OBTAINED TITTY'S PARDON AND SHE WAS SENT BACK TO THE BRICK FIELDS FOLLOWED AND HOOTED AT BY ALL THE BOYS
3540-163612-0114 AND THIS IS WHY TO DAY THE COUNTRY BOYS ALWAYS THROW STONES AT A TITMOUSE ON THE EVENING OF THE WEDDING DAY ALL THE LARDERS CELLARS CUPBOARDS AND TABLES OF THE PEOPLE WHETHER RICH OR POOR WERE LOADED AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT WITH BREAD WINE
3540-163612-0115 BEER CAKES AND TARTS ROAST LARKS AND EVEN GEESE SO THAT TUBBY COULD NOT COMPLAIN ANY MORE THAT HIS SON HAD MARRIED FAMINE
