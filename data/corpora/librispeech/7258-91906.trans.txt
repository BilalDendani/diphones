7258-91906-0000 RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION OF JESUS EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX IN REVIEWING MISTER R H HUTTON'S ESSAY ON CHRISTIAN EVIDENCES POPULAR AND CRITICAL
7258-91906-0001 ONLY FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT ITSELF I CONFINED MYSELF TO SHOWING OR ATTEMPTING TO SHOW THAT SUCH EVIDENCE IS UNSUBSTANTIAL BUT I COULD NOT CONSIDER THIS ARGUMENT ADEQUATE OR CONCLUSIVE
7258-91906-0002 FOR THERE ARE LARGE GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS OF INCOMPARABLY GREATER IMPORTANCE WHICH IT LEAVES OUT ALTOGETHER IT IS AS IF A CASE RULED BY BROAD PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY WERE TO BE DECIDED ON THE NARROWEST TECHNICAL GROUNDS
7258-91906-0003 THEREFORE WHILE CONFIDENT THAT EVEN ON THESE GROUNDS THE CASE MUST GO AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN BELIEVER I WISH TO ADD A FEW WORDS ON ITS WIDER RELATIONS IN ORDER THAT THE DECISION MAY BE ESTABLISHED
7258-91906-0004 WERE RECORDED OF ANY OTHER THAN JESUS IN ANY OTHER SACRED BOOK THAN THE BIBLE MISTER HUTTON AND ALL OTHER INTELLIGENT CHRISTIANS WOULD NOT ONLY DISBELIEVE IT BUT WOULD NOT EVEN CONDESCEND TO INVESTIGATE IT
7258-91906-0005 CONDEMNING IT OFFHAND AS TOO PREPOSTEROUS TO BE WORTHY OF SERIOUS ATTENTION THUS WHAT CHRISTIAN HAS EVER DEIGNED TO EXAMINE CRITICALLY THE MARVELS AFFIRMED IN THE KORAN SUCH AS MOHAMMED'S VISIT TO HEAVEN
7258-91906-0006 NAY WHAT BIBLIOLATER HAS EVER SERIOUSLY WEIGHED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE MIRACLES OF HIS FELLOW CHRISTIAN THE GREAT SAINT BERNARD SUCH AS THOSE WHICH ARE MINUTELY RELATED AND SOLEMNLY ATTESTED BY TEN EYE WITNESSES
7258-91906-0007 YOUR ENLIGHTENED PROTESTANT SIMPLY SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS AT ALL SUCH STORIES AND SAYS WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE OF COURSE MERE IMPOSTURE AND COLLUSION OR SUPERSTITION AND DELUSION
7258-91906-0008 WE DON'T THINK TWICE BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER THE IMPOSSIBLE EVER REALLY OCCURRED HOW THEN CAN THIS ENLIGHTENED PROTESTANT RECEIVE WITHOUT QUESTION THE MIRACLES OF THE JEWISH BOOKS
7258-91906-0009 WHILE REJECTING WITHOUT QUESTION ALL OTHERS WE HAVE SEEN THAT IT CANNOT BE BECAUSE OF ANY SUPERIORITY OF EVIDENCE FOR THE FORMER SINCE THE EVIDENCE FOR THE LATTER IS IN MANY CASES INFINITELY GREATER AND BETTER AUTHENTICATED
7258-91906-0010 AND SINCE HE DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO WEIGH EVIDENCE BEFORE EITHER ACCEPTING OR REJECTING THOUGH HE MAY SEEK EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT TO CONFIRM WHAT HE HAS ALREADY GIVEN HIMSELF TO BELIEVE
7258-91906-0011 HE ACCEPTS THE JEWISH MIRACLES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE COME DOWN TO HIM THROUGH MANY GENERATIONS OF HIS FOREFATHERS INVESTED WITH A GLAMOR OF SANCTITY AND HE REGARDS THEM WITH THE EYE OF FAITH WHICH SEES AND SEES NOT
7258-91906-0012 AND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS WHICH SLEPT AROSE AND CAME OUT OF THEIR GRAVES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION AND WENT INTO THE HOLY CITY AND APPEARED UNTO MANY
7258-91906-0013 THIS PRODIGAL MULTIPLICITY AND SUPERFLUITY OF RESURRECTIONS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN NOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO MODERN CHRISTIAN CHAMPIONS THOUGH DOUBTLESS IT DID NOT IN THE LEAST TROUBLE THE PRIMITIVE NON SCIENTIFIC BELIEVERS
7258-91906-0014 TO WHOM NOTHING WAS MORE NATURAL THAN THE UNNATURAL INCLUDING THE SUPERNATURAL AND THE INFRANATURAL AN APOLOGIST OF OUR DAYS WHO MUST AFFIRM THE ONE RESURRECTION SEEING THAT HIS WHOLE RELIGION IS BASED UPON IT
7258-91906-0015 AND WHO THOUGH VALIANTLY DEFYING SCIENCE SEEKS TO CONCILIATE HISTORICAL POSSIBILITY FINDS HIS TASK QUITE HEAVY ENOUGH IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACTS
7258-91906-0016 WE ARE SURELY AT THE UTMOST LIMITS OF THE POSSIBLE IN CONCEIVING THAT JESUS COULD APPEAR UNTO FIVE HUNDRED OF THE BRETHREN AT ONCE THERE IS NO HINT ELSEWHERE THAT HE HAD SO MANY PERMANENT FOLLOWERS IN HIS LIFETIME
7258-91906-0017 WE FIND THAT THERE WERE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY GATHERED AFTER THE ASCENSION WITHOUT THE PRIESTS AND THE ROMAN OFFICIALS HEARING OF THE APPARITION AND INVESTIGATING IT
7258-91906-0018 ONCE IN THE IMPERIAL ARCHIVES THE RECORD OF THE MIRACLE WOULD HAVE SPREAD EVERYWHERE ALL SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS WOULD HAVE RELATED IT ALL SUBSEQUENT WRITERS REFERRED TO IT SO IT IS NO WONDER THAT
7258-91906-0019 IS VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT NEITHER IN THE ACTS NOR IN THE EPISTLES IS THERE ANY ALLUSION TO THESE RESURRECTIONS WHEN PETER AND THE OTHERS WERE PREACHING THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
7258-91906-0020 WHOSE VISIBLE TANGIBLE LIVING AND SPEAKING EVIDENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE JUST AS THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS COULD BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT MISGIVING BY THE NON SCIENTIFIC EARLY CHRISTIANS
7258-91906-0021 TO WHOM MIRACLES APPEARED AMONG THE MOST FREQUENT OCCURRENCES OF LIFE SO COULD THE ASCENSION THEIR EARTH WAS A PLANE VAULTED BY THE SKY LAMPED BY THE LITTLE SUN AND MOON AND STARS
7258-91906-0022 THEIR CHRIST STANDING IN THE FLESH ON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES FLOATED UP THROUGH THIS VAULT TO SIT ENTHRONED BESIDE HIS FATHER IN THE MOST NATURAL SUPERNATURAL MANNER
7258-91906-0023 WE CAN CONCEIVE AND SYMPATHISE WITH THIS SIMPLE FAITH BUT IT IS HARD TO CONCEIVE AND SYMPATHISE WITH THE BLIND FAITH WHICH SEEMS WILFULLY BLIND
7258-91906-0024 IT HAS BEEN OFTEN REMARKED THAT COPERNICUS AND KEPLER AND NEWTON HAVE DESTROYED ALL THE OLD MYTHOLOGIES INCLUDING OF COURSE THE MYTHOLOGY OF BOTH THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS WITH THE EARTH NO LONGER THE UNIVERSE OF MORTAL LIFE
7258-91906-0025 BETWEEN A HEAVEN ABOVE ITS DOMED FIRMAMENT AND A HADES LIKE A VAST DUNGEON BENEATH BUT A QUITE INFINITESIMAL GRAIN OF SAND INVOLVED BY AN INFINITESIMAL DROP OF DEW
7258-91906-0026 AND AT INCONCEIVABLE DISTANCES FROM IT WITH MAN NO LONGER THE LORD OF THE CREATION FOR WHOSE SERVICE ALL THINGS WERE MADE BUT AN ANIMALCULE INEXPRESSIBLY SMALL LIVING FOR A MOMENT INEXPRESSIBLY BRIEF
7258-91906-0027 THE CHRISTIAN MYTHOLOGY AND SYSTEM AMONG OTHERS BECAUSE INEFFABLY ABSURD WHERE IS THE HEAVEN FOR ITS GOD WHERE THE HELL FOR ITS DEVIL WHERE IS ABOVE WHERE BENEATH
7258-91906-0028 IF JESUS HAD ASCENDED AND CONTINUED TO ASCEND WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT HE MIGHT BE ASCENDING NOW
7258-91906-0029 AS WE ARE LEARNING TO KNOW IT NOW TRY TO CONCEIVE AN INFINITE AND ETERNAL GOD OF THIS INFINITE AND ETERNAL WHOLE SACRIFICING HIS ONLY SON FOR THE SALVATION OF US MOST INSIGNIFICANT INSECTS
7258-91906-0030 NATURALLY THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS HATED AND RESISTED SCIENCE AND THE THEOLOGIANS HAVE SELDOM DARED TO FACE ITS CONCLUSIONS THEY IGNORE THE IMMENSITIES AND CONFINE THEIR VISION TO THE PAGES OF A SINGLE BOOK
7258-91906-0031 TO A HISTORY WHOSE CHRONOLOGY COUNTS NOT SIX THOUSAND YEARS BUT AS I HAVE REMARKED EVEN THIS MINUTE FIELD THEY CANNOT HOLD AGAINST THE SCEPTIC WHO HAS MADE THEM ABANDON ALL THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE
7258-91906-0032 WHY DID THEIR RISEN LORD ONLY SLINK ABOUT AMONG HIS OWN DISCIPLES APPEARING TO THESE BUT AT FLYING INSTANTS WHY DID HE NOT WITH HIS WELL KNOWN FEATURES AND WITH THE WOUNDS OF THE NAILS AND THE SPEAR IN HIS BODY
7258-91906-0033 AND THE WHOLE OF JERUSALEM AND COMPEL THEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND BEAR ENDURING WITNESS TO HIS RESURRECTION WHY DID HE NOT SUMMON ALL THE PEOPLE FROM THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST TO THE SOLEMN SPECTACLE OF HIS ASCENSION
7258-91906-0034 SECURING MULTITUDINOUS AND PERMANENTLY RECORDED EVIDENCE SUCH AS NONE OF US COULD DOUBT WE MIGHT GO ON ASKING WHY AND WHY AND WHY IN THIS FASHION ON A HUNDRED POINTS
7258-91906-0035 CONFIDENT THAT TO NOT ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS COULD THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST GIVE A STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SATISFACTORY ANSWER AS THE SCHEME OF THE ATONEMENT IS PRESENTED TO US GOD SACRIFICED HIS ONLY SON
