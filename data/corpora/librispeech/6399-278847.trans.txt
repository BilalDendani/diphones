6399-278847-0000 A DIGRESSION IN PRAISE OF DIGRESSIONS
6399-278847-0001 IN AN ILIAD THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HUMAN LIFE HAS RECEIVED MOST WONDERFUL ADVANTAGES FROM BOTH BUT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE WORLD IS CHIEFLY INDEBTED I SHALL LEAVE AMONG THE CURIOUS AS A PROBLEM WORTHY OF THEIR UTMOST INQUIRY
6399-278847-0002 FOR THE INVENTION OF THE LATTER I THINK THE COMMONWEALTH OF LEARNING IS CHIEFLY OBLIGED TO THE GREAT MODERN IMPROVEMENT OF DIGRESSIONS THE LATE REFINEMENTS IN KNOWLEDGE RUNNING PARALLEL TO THOSE OF DIET IN OUR NATION
6399-278847-0003 WHICH AMONG MEN OF A JUDICIOUS TASTE ARE DRESSED UP IN VARIOUS COMPOUNDS CONSISTING IN SOUPS AND OLIOS
6399-278847-0004 THERE IS A SORT OF MOROSE DETRACTING ILL BRED PEOPLE WHO PRETEND UTTERLY TO DISRELISH THESE POLITE INNOVATIONS
6399-278847-0005 AS TO THE SIMILITUDE FROM DIET THEY ALLOW THE PARALLEL BUT ARE SO BOLD AS TO PRONOUNCE THE EXAMPLE ITSELF
6399-278847-0006 IN A DISH WAS AT FIRST INTRODUCED IN COMPLIANCE TO A DEPRAVED AND DEBAUCHED APPETITE AS WELL AS TO A CRAZY CONSTITUTION AND TO SEE A MAN HUNTING THROUGH AN OLIO AFTER THE HEAD AND BRAINS OF A GOOSE A WIDGEON OR A WOODCOCK
6399-278847-0007 IS A SIGN HE WANTS A STOMACH AND DIGESTION FOR MORE SUBSTANTIAL VICTUALS FURTHER THEY AFFIRM THAT DIGRESSIONS IN A BOOK ARE LIKE FOREIGN TROOPS IN A STATE WHICH ARGUE THE NATION TO WANT A HEART AND HANDS OF ITS OWN
6399-278847-0008 THE SOCIETY OF WRITERS WOULD QUICKLY BE REDUCED TO A VERY INCONSIDERABLE NUMBER IF MEN WERE PUT UPON MAKING BOOKS WITH THE FATAL CONFINEMENT OF DELIVERING NOTHING BEYOND WHAT IS TO THE PURPOSE IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WERE THE CASE THE SAME AMONG US
6399-278847-0009 AS WITH THE GREEKS AND ROMANS WHEN LEARNING WAS IN ITS CRADLE TO BE REARED AND FED AND CLOTHED BY INVENTION IT WOULD BE AN EASY TASK
6399-278847-0010 TO FILL UP VOLUMES UPON PARTICULAR OCCASIONS WITHOUT FURTHER EXPATIATING FROM THE SUBJECT THAN BY MODERATE EXCURSIONS HELPING TO ADVANCE OR CLEAR THE MAIN DESIGN BUT WITH KNOWLEDGE IT HAS FARED AS WITH A NUMEROUS ARMY ENCAMPED IN A FRUITFUL COUNTRY
6399-278847-0011 WHICH FOR A FEW DAYS MAINTAINS ITSELF
6399-278847-0012 THEY SEND TO FORAGE MANY A MILE AMONG FRIENDS OR ENEMIES IT MATTERS NOT MEANWHILE THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS TRAMPLED AND BEATEN DOWN BECOME BARREN AND DRY AFFORDING NO SUSTENANCE BUT CLOUDS OF DUST
6399-278847-0013 THE WHOLE COURSE OF THINGS BEING THUS ENTIRELY CHANGED BETWEEN US AND THE ANCIENTS AND THE MODERNS WISELY SENSIBLE OF IT WE OF THIS AGE HAVE DISCOVERED A SHORTER AND MORE PRUDENT METHOD TO BECOME SCHOLARS AND WITS WITHOUT THE FATIGUE OF READING
6399-278847-0014 EITHER FIRST TO SERVE THEM AS SOME MEN DO LORDS LEARN THEIR TITLES EXACTLY AND THEN BRAG OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE OR SECONDLY
6399-278847-0015 THE PROFOUNDER AND POLITER METHOD TO GET A THOROUGH INSIGHT INTO THE INDEX BY WHICH THE WHOLE BOOK IS GOVERNED AND TURNED LIKE FISHES BY THE TAIL FOR TO ENTER THE PALACE OF LEARNING AT THE GREAT GATE REQUIRES AN EXPENSE OF TIME AND FORMS
6399-278847-0016 THEREFORE MEN OF MUCH HASTE AND LITTLE CEREMONY ARE CONTENT TO GET IN BY THE BACK DOOR
6399-278847-0017 BY CONSULTING ONLY WHAT COMES FROM BEHIND THUS MEN CATCH KNOWLEDGE BY THROWING THEIR WIT ON THE POSTERIORS OF A BOOK AS BOYS DO SPARROWS WITH FLINGING SALT UPON THEIR TAILS
6399-278847-0018 THUS HUMAN LIFE IS BEST UNDERSTOOD BY THE WISE MAN'S RULE OF REGARDING THE END THUS ARE THE SCIENCES FOUND LIKE HERCULES OXEN BY TRACING THEM BACKWARDS
6399-278847-0019 THUS ARE OLD SCIENCES UNRAVELLED LIKE OLD STOCKINGS BY BEGINNING AT THE FOOT BESIDES ALL THIS THE ARMY OF THE SCIENCES HATH BEEN OF LATE
6399-278847-0020 FOR THIS GREAT BLESSING WE ARE WHOLLY INDEBTED TO SYSTEMS AND ABSTRACTS IN WHICH THE MODERN FATHERS OF LEARNING LIKE PRUDENT USURERS SPENT THEIR SWEAT FOR THE EASE OF US THEIR CHILDREN FOR LABOUR IS THE SEED OF IDLENESS
6399-278847-0021 AND IT IS THE PECULIAR HAPPINESS OF OUR NOBLE AGE TO GATHER THE FRUIT NOW THE METHOD OF GROWING WISE LEARNED AND SUBLIME HAVING BECOME SO REGULAR AN AFFAIR AND SO ESTABLISHED IN ALL ITS FORMS THE NUMBER OF WRITERS MUST NEEDS HAVE INCREASED
6399-278847-0022 ACCORDINGLY AND TO A PITCH THAT HAS MADE IT OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR THEM TO INTERFERE CONTINUALLY WITH EACH OTHER BESIDES IT IS RECKONED THAT THERE IS NOT AT THIS PRESENT A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF NEW MATTER LEFT IN NATURE
6399-278847-0023 TO FURNISH AND ADORN ANY ONE PARTICULAR SUBJECT TO THE EXTENT OF A VOLUME THIS I AM TOLD BY A VERY SKILFUL COMPUTER WHO HATH GIVEN A FULL DEMONSTRATION OF IT FROM RULES OF ARITHMETIC
6399-278847-0024 THIS PERHAPS MAY BE OBJECTED AGAINST BY THOSE WHO MAINTAIN THE INFINITY OF MATTER AND THEREFORE WILL NOT ALLOW THAT ANY SPECIES OF IT CAN BE EXHAUSTED FOR ANSWER TO WHICH LET US EXAMINE THE NOBLEST BRANCH OF MODERN WIT OR INVENTION
6399-278847-0025 PLANTED AND CULTIVATED BY THE PRESENT AGE AND WHICH OF ALL OTHERS HATH BORNE THE MOST AND THE FAIREST FRUIT FOR THOUGH SOME REMAINS OF IT WERE LEFT US BY THE ANCIENTS YET HAVE NOT ANY OF THOSE AS I REMEMBER BEEN TRANSLATED OR COMPILED INTO SYSTEMS
6399-278847-0026 FOR MODERN USE THEREFORE WE MAY AFFIRM TO OUR OWN HONOUR THAT IT HAS IN SOME SORT BEEN BOTH INVENTED AND BROUGHT TO A PERFECTION BY THE SAME HANDS
6399-278847-0027 ALLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS VERY SURPRISING AGREEABLE AND APPOSITE FROM THE SIGNS OF EITHER SEX TOGETHER WITH THEIR PROPER USES AND TRULY HAVING OBSERVED HOW LITTLE INVENTION BEARS ANY VOGUE BESIDES WHAT IS DERIVED INTO THESE CHANNELS
6399-278847-0028 I HAVE SOMETIMES HAD A THOUGHT THAT THE HAPPY GENIUS OF OUR AGE AND COUNTRY WAS PROPHETICALLY HELD FORTH BY THAT ANCIENT TYPICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INDIAN PIGMIES
6399-278847-0029 PERTINGENTIA NOW I HAVE BEEN VERY CURIOUS TO INSPECT THE LATE PRODUCTIONS WHEREIN THE BEAUTIES OF THIS KIND HAVE MOST PROMINENTLY
6399-278847-0030 AND ALL ENDEAVOURS HAVE BEEN USED IN THE
6399-278847-0031 OF THEIR MARES THAT THEY MIGHT YIELD THE MORE MILK
6399-278847-0032 BE PROVIDED OR ELSE THAT WE MUST E E N BE CONTENT WITH REPETITION HERE AS WELL AS UPON ALL OTHER OCCASIONS THIS WILL STAND AS AN UNCONTESTABLE ARGUMENT THAT OUR MODERN WITS ARE NOT TO RECKON UPON THE INFINITY OF MATTER
6399-278847-0033 ARE TO BE NICELY DWELT ON BY SOME CALLED THE SIEVES AND BOULTERS OF LEARNING THOUGH IT IS LEFT UNDETERMINED WHETHER THEY DEALT IN PEARLS OR MEAL AND CONSEQUENTLY WHETHER WE ARE MORE TO VALUE THAT WHICH PASSED THROUGH OR WHAT STAYED
6399-278847-0034 BEHIND BY THESE METHODS IN A FEW WEEKS THERE STARTS UP MANY A WRITER CAPABLE OF MANAGING THE PROFOUNDEST AND MOST UNIVERSAL SUBJECTS
6399-278847-0035 BE FULL AND IF YOU WILL BATE HIM BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF METHOD AND STYLE AND GRAMMAR AND INVENTION ALLOW HIM BUT THE COMMON PRIVILEGES OF TRANSCRIBING FROM OTHERS
6399-278847-0036 AND DIGRESSING FROM HIMSELF AS OFTEN AS HE SHALL SEE OCCASION HE WILL DESIRE NO MORE INGREDIENTS TOWARDS FITTING UP A TREATISE THAT SHALL MAKE A VERY COMELY FIGURE ON A BOOKSELLER'S SHELF THERE TO BE PRESERVED NEAT AND CLEAN FOR A LONG ETERNITY
6399-278847-0037 ADORNED WITH THE HERALDRY OF ITS TITLE FAIRLY INSCRIBED ON A LABEL NEVER TO BE THUMBED OR GREASED BY STUDENTS NOR BOUND TO EVERLASTING CHAINS OF DARKNESS IN A LIBRARY BUT WHEN THE FULNESS OF TIME IS COME
6399-278847-0038 SHALL HAPPILY UNDERGO THE TRIAL OF PURGATORY IN ORDER TO ASCEND THE SKY WITHOUT THESE ALLOWANCES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE WE MODERN WITS SHOULD EVER HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE OUR COLLECTIONS LISTED UNDER SO MANY THOUSAND HEADS OF A DIFFERENT NATURE
6399-278847-0039 FOR WANT OF WHICH THE LEARNED WORLD WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF INFINITE DELIGHT AS WELL AS INSTRUCTION AND WE OURSELVES BURIED BEYOND REDRESS IN AN INGLORIOUS AND UNDISTINGUISHED OBLIVION
6399-278847-0040 A HAPPINESS DERIVED TO US WITH A GREAT MANY OTHERS FROM OUR SCYTHIAN ANCESTORS AMONG WHOM THE NUMBER OF PENS WAS SO INFINITE THAT THE GRECIAN ELOQUENCE HAD NO OTHER WAY OF EXPRESSING IT THAN BY SAYING THAT IN THE REGIONS FAR TO THE NORTH IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE
6399-278847-0041 FOR A MAN TO TRAVEL THE VERY AIR WAS SO REPLETE WITH FEATHERS THE NECESSITY OF THIS DIGRESSION WILL EASILY EXCUSE THE LENGTH AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR IT AS PROPER A PLACE AS I COULD READILY FIND
