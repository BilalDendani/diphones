2671-157948-0000 LET ME INTRODUCE MY BROTHER TO YOU SAID HELENE HER EYES SHIFTING UNEASILY FROM NATASHA TO ANATOLE NATASHA TURNED HER PRETTY LITTLE HEAD TOWARD THE ELEGANT YOUNG OFFICER AND SMILED AT HIM OVER HER BARE SHOULDER
2671-157948-0001 ANATOLE WHO WAS AS HANDSOME AT CLOSE QUARTERS AS AT A DISTANCE SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AND TOLD HER HE HAD LONG WISHED TO HAVE THIS HAPPINESS EVER SINCE THE NARYSHKINS BALL IN FACT AT WHICH HE HAD HAD THE WELL REMEMBERED PLEASURE OF SEEING HER
2671-157948-0002 KURAGIN WAS MUCH MORE SENSIBLE AND SIMPLE WITH WOMEN THAN AMONG MEN HE TALKED BOLDLY AND NATURALLY
2671-157948-0003 THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FORMIDABLE IN THIS MAN ABOUT WHOM THERE WAS SO MUCH TALK BUT THAT ON THE CONTRARY
2671-157948-0004 KURAGIN ASKED HER OPINION OF THE PERFORMANCE
2671-157948-0005 YOU OUGHT TO TAKE PART IN IT IT WILL BE GREAT FUN WE SHALL ALL MEET AT THE KARAGINS PLEASE COME NO REALLY EH SAID HE WHILE SAYING THIS HE NEVER REMOVED HIS SMILING EYES FROM HER FACE HER NECK AND HER BARE ARMS
2671-157948-0006 NATASHA KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT HE WAS ENRAPTURED BY HER THIS PLEASED HER YET HIS PRESENCE MADE HER FEEL CONSTRAINED AND OPPRESSED WHEN SHE WAS NOT LOOKING AT HIM SHE FELT THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT HER SHOULDERS AND SHE INVOLUNTARILY CAUGHT HIS EYE
2671-157948-0007 BUT LOOKING INTO HIS EYES SHE WAS FRIGHTENED REALIZING THAT THERE WAS NOT THAT BARRIER OF MODESTY
2671-157948-0008 WHEN SHE TURNED AWAY SHE FEARED HE MIGHT SEIZE HER FROM BEHIND BY HER BARE ARM AND KISS HER ON THE NECK THEY SPOKE OF MOST ORDINARY THINGS YET SHE FELT THAT THEY WERE CLOSER TO ONE ANOTHER THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN TO ANY MAN
2671-157948-0009 AS IF ASKING WHAT IT ALL MEANT BUT HELENE WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH A GENERAL AND DID NOT ANSWER HER LOOK AND HER FATHER'S EYES SAID NOTHING BUT WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAID HAVING A GOOD TIME WELL I'M GLAD OF IT
2671-157948-0010 DURING ONE OF THESE MOMENTS OF AWKWARD SILENCE WHEN ANATOLE'S PROMINENT EYES WERE GAZING CALMLY AND FIXEDLY AT HER NATASHA
2671-157948-0011 LOOKING AT HER SIGNIFICANTLY YOU'LL COME TO THE COSTUME TOURNAMENT COUNTESS DO COME AND PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO HER BOUQUET AND DROPPING HIS VOICE HE ADDED YOU WILL BE THE PRETTIEST THERE DO COME DEAR COUNTESS AND GIVE ME THIS FLOWER AS A PLEDGE
2671-157948-0012 BUT SHE FELT THAT HIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE WORDS HAD AN IMPROPER INTENTION SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND TURNED AWAY AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIS REMARK BUT AS SOON AS SHE HAD TURNED AWAY SHE FELT THAT HE WAS THERE BEHIND SO CLOSE BEHIND HER
2671-157948-0013 HOW IS HE NOW CONFUSED ANGRY OUGHT I TO PUT IT RIGHT SHE ASKED HERSELF AND SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TURNING ROUND SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES AND HIS NEARNESS SELF ASSURANCE AND THE GOOD NATURED TENDERNESS OF HIS SMILE VANQUISHED HER
2671-157948-0014 SHE SMILED JUST AS HE WAS DOING GAZING STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES AND AGAIN SHE FELT WITH HORROR THAT NO BARRIER LAY BETWEEN HIM AND HER THE CURTAIN ROSE AGAIN ANATOLE LEFT THE BOX SERENE AND GAY
2671-157948-0015 NATASHA WENT BACK TO HER FATHER IN THE OTHER BOX NOW QUITE SUBMISSIVE TO THE WORLD SHE FOUND HERSELF IN ALL THAT WAS GOING ON BEFORE HER NOW SEEMED QUITE NATURAL
2671-157948-0016 OR OF LIFE IN THE COUNTRY DID NOT ONCE RECUR TO HER MIND AND WERE AS IF BELONGING TO A REMOTE PAST IN THE FOURTH ACT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF DEVIL WHO SANG WAVING HIS ARM ABOUT TILL THE BOARDS WERE WITHDRAWN FROM UNDER HIM AND HE DISAPPEARED DOWN BELOW
2671-157948-0017 THAT WAS THE ONLY PART OF THE FOURTH ACT THAT NATASHA SAW SHE FELT AGITATED AND TORMENTED AND THE CAUSE OF THIS WAS KURAGIN WHOM SHE COULD NOT HELP WATCHING
2671-157948-0018 AS THEY WERE LEAVING THE THEATER ANATOLE CAME UP TO THEM CALLED THEIR CARRIAGE AND HELPED THEM IN AS HE WAS PUTTING NATASHA IN HE PRESSED HER ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW AGITATED AND FLUSHED SHE TURNED ROUND HE WAS LOOKING AT HER WITH GLITTERING EYES SMILING TENDERLY
2671-157948-0019 ONLY AFTER SHE HAD REACHED HOME WAS NATASHA ABLE CLEARLY TO THINK OVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERING PRINCE ANDREW SHE WAS HORRIFIED AND AT TEA TO WHICH ALL HAD SAT DOWN AFTER THE OPERA SHE GAVE A LOUD EXCLAMATION FLUSHED AND RAN OUT OF THE ROOM
2671-157948-0020 O GOD I AM LOST SHE SAID TO HERSELF HOW COULD I LET HIM SHE SAT FOR A LONG TIME HIDING HER FLUSHED FACE IN HER HANDS TRYING TO REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER BUT WAS UNABLE EITHER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED OR WHAT SHE FELT
2671-157948-0021 EVERYTHING SEEMED DARK OBSCURE AND TERRIBLE THERE IN THAT ENORMOUS ILLUMINATED THEATER WHERE THE BARE LEGGED DUPORT IN A TINSEL DECORATED JACKET JUMPED ABOUT TO THE MUSIC ON WET BOARDS AND YOUNG GIRLS AND OLD MEN
2671-157948-0022 IT HAD ALL SEEMED CLEAR AND SIMPLE BUT NOW ALONE BY HERSELF IT WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHAT IS IT WHAT WAS THAT TERROR I FELT OF HIM
2671-157948-0023 ONLY TO THE OLD COUNTESS AT NIGHT IN BED COULD NATASHA HAVE TOLD ALL SHE WAS FEELING SHE KNEW THAT SONYA WITH HER SEVERE AND SIMPLE VIEWS WOULD EITHER NOT UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL OR WOULD BE HORRIFIED AT SUCH A CONFESSION
2671-157948-0024 SO NATASHA TRIED TO SOLVE WHAT WAS TORTURING HER BY HERSELF AM I SPOILED FOR ANDREW'S LOVE OR NOT SHE ASKED HERSELF AND WITH SOOTHING IRONY REPLIED WHAT A FOOL I AM TO ASK THAT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO ME NOTHING
2671-157948-0025 I HAVE DONE NOTHING I DIDN'T LEAD HIM ON AT ALL NOBODY WILL KNOW AND I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN SHE TOLD HERSELF
2671-157948-0026 AND ANDREW CAN LOVE ME STILL BUT WHY STILL O GOD WHY ISN'T HE HERE NATASHA QUIETED HERSELF FOR A MOMENT BUT AGAIN SOME INSTINCT TOLD HER THAT THOUGH ALL THIS WAS TRUE AND THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
2671-157948-0027 YET THE FORMER PURITY OF HER LOVE FOR PRINCE ANDREW HAD PERISHED
