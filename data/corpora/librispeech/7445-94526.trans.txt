7445-94526-0000 BUT AFTER MAKING ALL PROPER ALLOWANCES HE STILL APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A WEAK PRINCE AND UNFIT FOR GOVERNMENT LESS FOR WANT OF NATURAL PARTS AND CAPACITY THAN OF SOLID JUDGMENT AND A GOOD EDUCATION
7445-94526-0001 AND CONSEQUENTLY DANGEROUS IN A LIMITED AND MIXED GOVERNMENT HAD HE POSSESSED THE TALENTS OF GAINING AND STILL MORE THOSE OF OVERAWING HIS GREAT BARONS HE MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED ALL THE MISFORTUNES OF HIS REIGN
7445-94526-0002 BUT WHEN THE GRANDEES WERE TEMPTED BY HIS WANT OF PRUDENCE AND OF VIGOR TO RESIST HIS AUTHORITY AND EXECUTE THE MOST VIOLENT ENTERPRISES UPON HIM HE WAS NATURALLY LED TO SEEK AN OPPORTUNITY OF RETALIATION JUSTICE WAS NEGLECTED
7445-94526-0003 THE LIVES OF THE CHIEF NOBILITY WERE SACRIFICED AND ALL THESE ENORMITIES SEEM TO HAVE PROCEEDED LESS FROM A SETTLED DESIGN OF ESTABLISHING ARBITRARY POWER THAN FROM THE INSOLENCE OF VICTORY AND THE NECESSITIES OF THE KING'S SITUATION
7445-94526-0004 OR IF ANY DIFFERENCE MAY BE REMARKED BETWEEN THEM WE SHALL FIND THAT THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN BEING MORE LEGAL WAS COMMONLY CARRIED WHEN IT PREVAILED TO LESS DESPERATE EXTREMITIES THAN WAS THAT OF THE ARISTOCRACY
7445-94526-0005 ON COMPARING THE CONDUCT AND EVENTS OF THIS REIGN WITH THOSE OF THE PRECEDING WE SHALL FIND EQUAL REASON TO ADMIRE EDWARD AND TO BLAME RICHARD BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF OPPOSITION SURELY WILL NOT LIE IN THE STRICT REGARD PAID BY THE FORMER TO NATIONAL PRIVILEGES
7445-94526-0006 AND THE NEGLECT OF THEM BY THE LATTER ON THE CONTRARY THE PRINCE OF SMALL ABILITIES AS HE FELT HIS WANT OF POWER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MORE MODERATE IN THIS RESPECT THAN THE OTHER
7445-94526-0007 TILL THE ASSEMBLING OF HIS LAST PARLIAMENT WHICH WAS SUMMONED BY HIS INVETERATE ENEMIES WHICH DETHRONED HIM WHICH FRAMED THEIR COMPLAINTS DURING THE TIME OF THE MOST FURIOUS CONVULTIONS AND WHOSE TESTIMONY MUST THEREFORE HAVE ON THAT ACCOUNT
7445-94526-0008 AND TO SELL SOME OF HIS PREROGATIVES FOR PRESENT SUPPLY BUT AS THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH HIS GENIUS AND CAPACITY THEY VENTURED NOT TO DEMAND ANY EXORBITANT CONCESSIONS OR SUCH AS WERE INCOMPATIBLE WITH REGAL AND SOVEREIGN POWER
7445-94526-0009 EDWARD HAD NO SOONER GOTTEN THE SUPPLY THAN HE DEPARTED FROM THE ENGAGEMENTS WHICH HAD INDUCED THE PARLIAMENT TO GRANT IT HE OPENLY TOLD HIS PEOPLE THAT HE HAD BUT DISSEMBLED WITH THEM WHEN HE SEEMED TO MAKE THEM THESE CONCESSIONS
7445-94526-0010 IT WERE HAPPY FOR SOCIETY DID THIS CONTRAST ALWAYS DEPEND ON THE JUSTICE OR INJUSTICE OF THE MEASURES WHICH MEN EMBRACE AND NOT RATHER ON THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF PRUDENCE AND VIGOR WITH WHICH THOSE MEASURES ARE SUPPORTED
7445-94526-0011 THERE WAS A SENSIBLE DECAY OF ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY DURING THIS PERIOD THE DISGUST WHICH THE LAITY HAD RECEIVED FROM THE NUMEROUS USURPATIONS BOTH OF THE COURT OF ROME AND OF THEIR OWN CLERGY
7445-94526-0012 HAD VERY MUCH WEANED THE KINGDOM FROM SUPERSTITION AND STRONG SYMPTOMS APPEARED FROM TIME TO TIME
7445-94526-0013 WICKLIFFE HIMSELF AS WELL AS HIS DISCIPLES WHO RECEIVED THE NAME OF WICKLIFFITES OR LOLLARDS WAS DISTINGUISHED BY A GREAT AUSTERITY OF LIFE AND MANNERS A CIRCUMSTANCE COMMON TO ALMOST ALL THOSE WHO DOGMATIZE IN ANY NEW WAY
7445-94526-0014 BOTH BECAUSE MEN WHO DRAW TO THEM THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC AND EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO THE ODIUM OF GREAT MULTITUDES ARE OBLIGED TO BE VERY GUARDED IN THEIR CONDUCT AND BECAUSE FEW WHO HAVE A STRONG PROPENSITY TO PLEASURE OR BUSINESS WILL ENTER UPON SO DIFFICULT AND LABORIOUS AN UNDERTAKING
7445-94526-0015 HE DENIED THE DOCTRINE OF THE REAL PRESENCE THE SUPREMACY OF THE CHURCH OF ROME THE MERIT OF MONASTIC VOWS HE MAINTAINED THAT THE SCRIPTURES WERE THE SOLE RULE OF FAITH THAT THE CHURCH WAS DEPENDENT ON THE STATE AND SHOULD BE REFORMED BY IT
7445-94526-0016 CITED HIM BEFORE HIS TRIBUNAL BUT THE REFORMER HAD NOW ACQUIRED POWERFUL PROTECTORS WHO SCREENED HIM FROM THE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION THE DUKE OF LANCASTER WHO THEN GOVERNED THE KINGDOM ENCOURAGED THE PRINCIPLES OF WICKLIFFE
7445-94526-0017 IN ORDER TO GIVE HIM COUNTENANCE UPON HIS TRIAL HE EVEN INSISTED THAT WICKLIFFE SHOULD SIT IN THE BISHOP'S PRESENCE WHILE HIS PRINCIPLES WERE EXAMINED COURTENEY EXCLAIMED AGAINST THE INSULT
7445-94526-0018 THE DUKE OF LANCASTER HOWEVER STILL CONTINUED HIS PROTECTION TO WICKLIFFE DURING THE MINORITY OF RICHARD AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT REFORMER HAD SO FAR PROPAGATED THEMSELVES
7445-94526-0019 THE UNIVERSITY DELIBERATED FOR SOME TIME WHETHER THEY SHOULD RECEIVE THE BULL AND THEY NEVER TOOK ANY VIGOROUS MEASURES IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE PAPAL ORDERS
7445-94526-0020 AFFIRMED THAT THEY HAD NO INTENTION TO BIND THEMSELVES TO THE PRELATES FURTHER THAN THEIR ANCESTORS HAD DONE BEFORE THEM AND REQUIRED THAT THE PRETENDED STATUTE SHOULD BE REPEALED WHICH WAS DONE ACCORDINGLY
7445-94526-0021 MOST OF HIS FOLLOWERS IMITATED HIS CAUTIOUS DISPOSITION AND SAVED THEMSELVES EITHER BY RECANTATIONS OR EXPLANATIONS HE DIED OF A PALSY IN THE YEAR THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE AT HIS RECTORY OF LUTTERWORTH IN THE COUNTY OF LEICESTER
7445-94526-0022 AND THE CLERGY MORTIFIED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ESCAPED THEIR VENGEANCE TOOK CARE BESIDES ASSURING THE PEOPLE OF HIS ETERNAL DAMNATION TO REPRESENT HIS LAST DISTEMPER AS A VISIBLE JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN UPON HIM FOR HIS MULTIPLIED HERESIES AND IMPIETIES
7445-94526-0023 THE PARLIAMENT IN THE REIGN OF RICHARD ENACTED A LAW AGAINST THIS ABUSE AND THE KING MADE A GENERAL REMONSTRANCE TO THE COURT OF ROME AGAINST ALL THOSE USURPATIONS WHICH HE CALLS HORRIBLE EXCESSES OF THAT COURT
7445-94526-0024 IT WAS USUAL FOR THE CHURCH THAT THEY MIGHT ELUDE THE MORTMAIN ACT TO MAKE THEIR VOTARIES LEAVE LANDS IN TRUST TO CERTAIN PERSONS
7445-94526-0025 THE FRENCH CARDINALS AS SOON AS THEY RECOVERED THEIR LIBERTY FLED FROM ROME AND PROTESTING AGAINST THE FORCED ELECTION CHOSE ROBERT SON OF THE COUNT OF GENEVA
7445-94526-0026 ALL THE KINGDOMS OF CHRISTENDOM ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL INTERESTS AND INCLINATIONS WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN THESE TWO PONTIFFS THE COURT OF FRANCE ADHERED TO CLEMENT AND WAS FOLLOWED BY ITS ALLIES THE KING OF CASTILE AND THE KING OF SCOTLAND
7445-94526-0027 ENGLAND OF COURSE WAS THROWN INTO THE OTHER PARTY AND DECLARED FOR URBAN THUS THE APPELLATION OF CLEMENTINES AND URBANISTS DISTRACTED EUROPE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND EACH PARTY DAMNED THE OTHER AS SCHISMATICS AND AS REBELS TO THE TRUE VICAR OF CHRIST
7445-94526-0028 BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THOUGH IT WEAKENED THE PAPAL AUTHORITY HAD NOT SO GREAT AN EFFECT AS MIGHT NATURALLY BE IMAGINED THOUGH ANY KING COULD EASILY AT FIRST MAKE HIS KINGDOM EMBRACE THE PARTY OF ONE POPE OR THE OTHER OR EVEN KEEP IT SOME TIME IN SUSPENSE BETWEEN THEM
7445-94526-0029 HE COULD NOT SO EASILY TRANSFER HIS OBEDIENCE AT PLEASURE THE PEOPLE ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN PARTY AS TO A RELIGIOUS OPINION AND CONCEIVED AN EXTREME ABHORRENCE TO THE OPPOSITE PARTY WHOM THEY REGARDED AS LITTLE BETTER THAN SARACENS OR INFIDELS
7445-94526-0030 CRUSADES WERE EVEN UNDERTAKEN IN THIS QUARREL AND THE ZEALOUS BISHOP OF NORWICH IN PARTICULAR LED OVER IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY TWO NEAR SIXTY THOUSAND BIGOTS INTO FLANDERS AGAINST THE CLEMENTINES
7445-94526-0031 BUT AFTER LOSING A GREAT PART OF HIS FOLLOWERS HE RETURNED WITH DISGRACE INTO ENGLAND EACH POPE SENSIBLE FROM THIS PREVAILING SPIRIT AMONG THE PEOPLE THAT THE KINGDOM WHICH ONCE EMBRACED HIS CAUSE WOULD ALWAYS ADHERE TO HIM BOLDLY MAINTAINED ALL THE PRETENSIONS OF HIS SEE
7445-94526-0032 WE MEET WITH THIS PREAMBLE TO A LAW ENACTED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS REIGN
7445-94526-0033 AS WELL OF ESQUIRES AS OF OTHERS IN MANY PARTS OF THE REALM GIVING TO THEM HATS AND OTHER LIVERY OF ONE SUIT
7445-94526-0034 THAT NO SUBJECT COULD TRUST TO THEIR PROTECTION MEN OPENLY ASSOCIATED THEMSELVES UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF SOME GREAT BARON FOR THEIR MUTUAL DEFENCE THEY WORE PUBLIC BADGES BY WHICH THEIR CONFEDERACY WAS DISTINGUISHED
7445-94526-0035 HENCE THE LARGE DISCRETIONARY PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN AND THE DANGER WHICH MIGHT HAVE ENSUED FROM THE TOO GREAT LIMITATION OF THEM IF THE KING HAD POSSESSED NO ARBITRARY POWERS WHILE ALL THE NOBLES ASSUMED AND EXERCISED THEM THERE MUST HAVE ENSUED AN ABSOLUTE ANARCHY IN THE STATE
7445-94526-0036 THEY ENACTED THAT NO PARDON FOR RAPES OR FOR MURDER FROM MALICE PREPENSE SHOULD BE VALID UNLESS THE CRIME WERE PARTICULARLY SPECIFIED IN IT
7445-94526-0037 THE QUALITY OF PATRON NATURALLY UNITED ITSELF TO THAT OF SUPERIOR
7445-94526-0038 BUT WHEN BY THE VARIOUS DIVISIONS AND MIXTURES OF PROPERTY A MAN'S SUPERIOR CAME TO LIVE AT A DISTANCE FROM HIM AND COULD NO LONGER GIVE HIM SHELTER OR COUNTENANCE THE TIE GRADUALLY BECAME MORE FICTITIOUS THAN REAL NEW CONNECTIONS FROM VICINITY OR OTHER CAUSES WERE FORMED
7445-94526-0039 THE APPEARANCE OF VALOR SPIRIT ABILITIES IN ANY GREAT MAN EXTENDED HIS INTEREST VERY FAR AND IF THE SOVEREIGN WERE DEFICIENT IN THESE QUALITIES HE WAS NO LESS IF NOT MORE EXPOSED TO THE USURPATIONS OF THE ARISTOCRACY THAN EVEN DURING THE VIGOR OF THE FEUDAL SYSTEM
7445-94526-0040 THE PRACTICE OF LEVYING BENEVOLENCES IS ALSO FIRST MENTIONED IN THE PRESENT REIGN THIS PRINCE LIVED IN A MORE MAGNIFICENT MANNER THAN PERHAPS ANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS OR SUCCESSORS HIS HOUSEHOLD CONSISTED OF TEN THOUSAND PERSONS
