2140-160867-0038 AT LENGTH HE COULD ONLY PROCEED WITH GREAT TROUBLE AND MUST NEEDS STOP EVERY MINUTE THE STONES TOO CRUSHED HIM TERRIBLY THEN HE COULD NOT CONCEAL THE THOUGHT HOW NICE IT WOULD BE NOW TO HAVE NOTHING TO CARRY
2140-160867-0039 LIKE A SNAIL HE CREPT UP TO A WELL WISHING TO REST HIMSELF AND ENJOY A REFRESHING DRINK IN ORDER NOT TO SPOIL THE STONES IN SETTING THEM DOWN HE LAID THEM CAREFULLY ON THE GROUND ONE BESIDE THE OTHER
