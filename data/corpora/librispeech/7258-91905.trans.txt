7258-91905-0000 WE HAVE ALL HEARD THE WONDERFUL STORY RECOUNTED BY PLUTARCH IN HIS TREATISE ON THE CESSATION OF THE ORACLES HOW
7258-91905-0001 WHEN A LOUD AND TERRIBLE VOICE FROM THE LAND CALLED THAMOUS THE PILOT AND HE HAVING RESPONDED AT THE THIRD APPEAL
7258-91905-0002 THE VOICE GROWN YET LOUDER AND MORE TERRIBLE
7258-91905-0003 THAT PAN THE GREAT WAS DEAD ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE VESSEL REACHED THIS PLACE
7258-91905-0004 THE GOOD PANTAGRUEL GOES ON TO EXPOUND THE STORY AFTER HIS OWN MANNER THINKING THAT IT REFERRED NOT TO THE HEATHEN GOD PAN BUT TO OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST IGNOMINIOUSLY PUT TO DEATH
7258-91905-0005 BY THE ENVY AND INIQUITY OF THE PONTIFFS DOCTORS PRESBYTERS AND MONKS OF THE MOSAIC DISPENSATION FOR WITH GOOD RIGHT MAY HE IN THE GREEK TONGUE BE CALLED PAN SEEING THAT HE IS OUR ALL ALL WE ARE
7258-91905-0006 IS HIM IN HIM OF HIM BY HIM HE IS THE GOOD PAN THE GREAT SHEPHERD AT WHOSE DEATH WERE MOANINGS SIGHS TREPIDATIONS
7258-91905-0007 AND LAMENTATIONS IN ALL THE MACHINE OF THE UNIVERSE HEAVENS EARTH SEA HELLS WITH THIS MY INTERPRETATION THE TIME AGREES FOR THAT MOST GOOD
7258-91905-0008 MOST GREAT PAN OUR ONLY SAVIOR DIED AT JERUSALEM REIGNING IN ROME TIBERIUS CAESAR PANTAGRUEL THESE WORDS SAID RESTED IN SILENCE AND PROFOUND CONTEMPLATION
7258-91905-0009 AND MY DEEP REVERENCE FOR RABELAIS WITH WHOM NO COMMENTATOR IN HOLY ORDERS KNOWN TO ME CAN BE COMPARED EXCEPT DEAN SWIFT I AM INCLINED ON THIS POINT TO FOLLOW THE ORDINARY OPINION THAT PAN THE GREAT GOD WHOSE DEATH WAS THUS
7258-91905-0010 MIRACULOUSLY ANNOUNCED WAS THE PAN OF THE HEATHEN GREEKS CHRIST HAD DIED BUT ONLY PRO TEM HAD DESCENDED INTO HELL BUT WITH A RETURN TICKET
7258-91905-0011 THIS WORLD AND LIFE WERE CONTEMNED FOR THE LIFE AND WORLD TO COME NATURE THE ALL THE GREAT PAN WAS ANNULLED AND THE SUPERNATURAL NOTHING THRONED SUPREME
7258-91905-0012 THE POETS HAVE CHANTED THIS MOMENTOUS REVOLUTION ACCORDING TO THEIR RELIGION THEIR PHANTASY OR THEIR MOOD MILTON IN HIS HYMN ON THE NATIVITY
7258-91905-0013 SHOUTS HARSH PURITANICAL SCORN ON THE ORACLES STRICKEN DUMB AND THE DEITIES OVERTHROWN SHELLEY IN A MAGNIFICENT CHORUS OF HELLAS
7258-91905-0014 CONTESTS NOT THE JUSTICE OF THEIR DOOM WHILE IN THE FINAL CHORUS HE PREDICTS THE SAME DOOM FOR THEIR CONQUEROR IN HIS TURN IN OUR OWN DAY
7258-91905-0015 AND ELSEWHERE HAS BEWAILED THE DEAD IMMORTALS WITH NOTHING BUT AVERSION AND CONTEMPT FOR THE PALE GALILEAN THE GHASTLY GLORIES OF SAINTS DEAD LIMBS OF GIBBETED GODS
7258-91905-0016 BEAUTIFUL BUT NOT OF HIS DEEPEST REGRETS THE BANISHED DIVINITIES AND SINCE THE HALLS OF OLYMPUS ARE VOID APPEALS TO NATURE TO RESTORE TO HIS SPIRIT ITS FIRST FIRE IF SHE INDEED LIVES
7258-91905-0017 AND THE REAL WE ACCEPT PERFORCE IN ITS FULNESS BUT DISCERN NOT HOW IT CAN DERIVE FROM AN UNREAL GOD NOVALIS IN HIS HYMNS TO THE NIGHT LAMENTS WITH SCHILLER
7258-91905-0018 THE UNSOULING OF NATURE BOUND IN IRON CHAINS BY ARID NUMBER AND RIGOROUS RULE BUT GOES ON TO CELEBRATE THE RESURRECTION OF HUMANITY IN CHRIST
7258-91905-0019 GODS OF GREECE AFTER DECLARING IN HIS WILD WAY THAT HE HAS NEVER LOVED THE OLD DEITIES THAT TO HIM THE GREEK ARE REPUGNANT AND THE ROMANS THOROUGHLY HATEFUL YET
7258-91905-0020 HE FEELS READY TO FIGHT FOR THE FORMER AGAINST THESE THIS CHANGE OF THE CELESTIAL DYNASTY IS INDEED A FAVORITE THEME WITH HIM ELSEWHERE HE PICTURES THE OLYMPIANS HOLDING HIGH REVELRY
7258-91905-0021 HIS BROW BLEEDING FROM A CROWN OF THORNS TRAILING ON HIS SHOULDER A HEAVY CROSS WHICH HE HEAVES UPON THE BANQUET TABLE AND FORTHWITH THE REVEL IS NO MORE
7258-91905-0022 IN HIS INCOMPARABLE GODS IN EXILE HE TELLS US WHAT BECAME OF THESE DISPERSED OLYMPIANS DURING THE DARK AGES IN THE THICK NIGHT OF THE NOONTIDE OF CHRISTIANITY HOW THEY WERE TRANSFORMED FROM CELESTIAL TO INFERNAL
7258-91905-0023 BY THE MONSTROUS SUPERSTITION OF THAT BALEFUL ERA AS WE FIND THE HOOFS AND HORNS OF PAN TRANSFERRED TO THE DEVIL HIMSELF AS WE FIND VENUS
7258-91905-0024 IT IS FULL TIME TO PROCLAIM THE DEATH OF THE GREAT GOD CHRIST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS MAKE A FAIRLY LONG PERIOD EVEN FOR A CELESTIAL DYNASTY BUT THIS ONE IN ITS PERISHING
7258-91905-0025 FATE IN THE FORM OF SCIENCE HAS DECREED THE EXTINCTION OF THE GODS MARY AND HER BABE MUST JOIN VENUS AND LOVE ISIS AND HORUS LIVING WITH THEM ONLY IN THE WORLD OF ART
7258-91905-0026 JESUS ON HIS CROSS MUST DWINDLE TO A POINT EVEN IN THE REALMS OF LEGEND UNDER PROMETHEUS ON CAUCASUS FOR AGES ALREADY THE FATHER HAS BEEN AS SPECTRAL AS JUPITER
7258-91905-0027 FOR AGES ALREADY THE HOLY GHOST HAS BEEN BUT THE SHADOW OF A SHADE AND THE LAST NOT LEAST MEMBER OF THE DIVINE ROYAL FAMILY SATAN THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS
7258-91905-0028 IS NO MORE ALIVE THAN PLUTO WHO ALSO WAS BORN BROTHER TO THE MONARCH OF HEAVEN THE HEBREW DYNASTY OF THE GODS IS NO MORE IT HAS DONE MUCH EVIL IN ITS LONG SOVRANTY
7258-91905-0029 WHICH WE WILL TRY TO FORGET NOW IT CEASES TO REIGN IT HAS DONE SOME LITTLE GOOD WHOSE REMEMBRANCE WE WILL CHERISH WHEN IT IS SEPULCHRED CHRIST THE GREAT IS DEAD
7258-91905-0030 BUT PAN THE GREAT LIVES AGAIN AS MISTER MACCALL TOLD US IN SOME LINES PUBLISHED IN THIS PAPER SEVERAL YEARS AGO PAN LIVES NOT AS A GOD BUT AS THE ALL NATURE
7258-91905-0031 NOW THAT THE OPPRESSION OF THE SUPERNATURAL IS REMOVED I MAY BE TOLD THAT CHRISTIANITY IS YET ALIVE AND FLOURISHING THAT ITS PRIESTHOOD AND ITS CHURCHES HOLD POSSESSION OF EUROPE AND AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA
7258-91905-0032 WHEN THE NOBLEST HEARTS WORSHIP NOT AT ITS ALTARS WHEN THE MOST VIGOROUS INTELLECTS ABANDON ITS CREEDS THE KNELL OF ITS DOOM HAS RUNG AT THE RISK OF BEING THOUGHT BIGOTED OR PREJUDICED
7258-91905-0033 I MUST AVOW THAT TO MY MIND THE DECOMPOSITION OF CHRISTIANITY IS SO OFFENSIVELY MANIFEST AND ADVANCED THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
7258-91905-0034 A VERY FEW PERSONS WHOSE TRANSCENDENT GENIUS COULD THROW A GLAMOR OF GLORY OVER ANY CREED HOWEVER CRUDE AND MEAN AND WHOM I RECOGNISE AS FAR ABOVE MY JUDGMENT
7258-91905-0035 I CAN NO LONGER GIVE MY ESTEEM TO ANY EDUCATED MAN WHO HAS INVESTIGATED AND STILL PROFESSES THIS RELIGION WITHOUT GRAVE DEDUCTION AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS HEART HIS INTELLECT OR HIS CONSCIENCE
