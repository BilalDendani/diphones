6788-96241-0000 FOURTH BOOK THE WORLD AS WILL SECOND ASPECT
6788-96241-0001 THE MATTER WHICH CONCERNS EVERY ONE DIRECTLY AND CAN BE FOREIGN OR INDIFFERENT TO NONE IT IS INDEED SO CHARACTERISTIC OF THE NATURE OF MAN TO RELATE EVERYTHING ELSE TO ACTION
6788-96241-0002 THAT IN EVERY SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION HE WILL ALWAYS TREAT THE PART THAT HAS TO DO WITH ACTION AS THE RESULT OR OUTCOME OF THE WHOLE WORK SO FAR AT LEAST AS IT INTERESTS HIM AND WILL THEREFORE GIVE HIS MOST SERIOUS ATTENTION TO THIS PART
6788-96241-0003 BUT IN MY OPINION ALL PHILOSOPHY IS THEORETICAL BECAUSE IT IS ESSENTIAL TO IT THAT IT SHOULD RETAIN A PURELY CONTEMPLATIVE ATTITUDE AND SHOULD INVESTIGATE NOT PRESCRIBE TO BECOME ON THE CONTRARY PRACTICAL
6788-96241-0004 TO GUIDE CONDUCT TO TRANSFORM CHARACTER ARE OLD CLAIMS WHICH WITH FULLER INSIGHT IT OUGHT FINALLY TO GIVE UP FOR HERE WHERE THE WORTH OR WORTHLESSNESS OF AN EXISTENCE WHERE SALVATION OR DAMNATION ARE IN QUESTION
6788-96241-0005 THE DEAD CONCEPTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY DO NOT DECIDE THE MATTER BUT THE INMOST NATURE OF MAN HIMSELF THE DAEMON THAT GUIDES HIM AND THAT HAS NOT CHOSEN HIM BUT BEEN CHOSEN BY HIM AS PLATO WOULD SAY
6788-96241-0006 THAT IS AS FEELING EXPRESSES ITSELF COMPREHENSIBLY TO EVERY ONE THIS HOWEVER IT DOES IN EVERY POSSIBLE REFERENCE AND FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW
6788-96241-0007 NOW AS THIS ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE FROM OTHER POINTS OF VIEW IN THE THREE PRECEDING BOOKS WITH THE GENERALITY THAT IS PROPER TO PHILOSOPHY IN THIS BOOK THE ACTION OF MEN WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE SAME WAY
6788-96241-0008 AND THIS SIDE OF THE WORLD MIGHT INDEED BE CONSIDERED THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL NOT ONLY SUBJECTIVELY AS I REMARKED ABOVE BUT ALSO OBJECTIVELY IN CONSIDERING IT I SHALL FAITHFULLY ADHERE TO THE METHOD I HAVE HITHERTO FOLLOWED
6788-96241-0009 AND SHALL SUPPORT MYSELF BY PRESUPPOSING ALL THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ADVANCED THERE IS INDEED JUST ONE THOUGHT WHICH FORMS THE CONTENT OF THIS WHOLE WORK I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO WORK IT OUT IN ALL OTHER SPHERES AND I SHALL NOW DO SO
6788-96241-0010 WITH REGARD TO HUMAN ACTION I SHALL THEN HAVE DONE ALL THAT IS IN MY POWER TO COMMUNICATE IT AS FULLY AS POSSIBLE THE GIVEN POINT OF VIEW AND THE METHOD OF TREATMENT ANNOUNCED
6788-96241-0011 ARE THEMSELVES SUFFICIENT TO INDICATE THAT IN THIS ETHICAL BOOK NO PRECEPTS NO DOCTRINE OF DUTY MUST BE LOOKED FOR STILL LESS WILL A GENERAL MORAL PRINCIPLE BE GIVEN AN UNIVERSAL RECEIPT AS IT WERE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ALL THE VIRTUES
6788-96241-0012 NEITHER SHALL WE TALK OF AN ABSOLUTE OUGHT FOR THIS CONTAINS A CONTRADICTION AS IS EXPLAINED IN THE APPENDIX NOR YET OF A LAW OF FREEDOM WHICH IS IN THE SAME POSITION
6788-96241-0013 SO DOES ITS ACTION AND ITS WORLD BECOME BOTH ARE THE SELF KNOWLEDGE OF THE WILL AND NOTHING MORE THE WILL DETERMINES ITSELF AND AT THE SAME TIME BOTH ITS ACTION AND ITS WORLD FOR BESIDES IT THERE IS NOTHING AND THESE ARE THE WILL ITSELF
6788-96241-0014 ONLY THUS IS THE WILL TRULY AUTONOMOUS AND FROM EVERY OTHER POINT OF VIEW IT IS HETERONOMOUS OUR PHILOSOPHICAL ENDEAVOURS CAN ONLY EXTEND TO EXHIBITING AND EXPLAINING THE ACTION OF MEN IN ITS INNER NATURE AND CONTENT
6788-96241-0015 THE VARIOUS AND EVEN OPPOSITE MAXIMS WHOSE LIVING EXPRESSION IT IS THIS WE SHALL DO IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRECEDING PORTION OF OUR WORK AND IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY AS WE HAVE HITHERTO EXPLAINED THE OTHER PHENOMENA OF THE WORLD
6788-96241-0016 AND HAVE SOUGHT TO BRING THEIR INMOST NATURE TO DISTINCT ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE OUR PHILOSOPHY WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME IMMANENCY IN THE CASE OF ACTION AS IN ALL THAT WE HAVE HITHERTO CONSIDERED
6788-96241-0017 NOTWITHSTANDING KANT'S GREAT DOCTRINE IT WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE FORMS OF THE PHENOMENON THE UNIVERSAL EXPRESSION OF WHICH IS THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT REASON AS A LEAPING POLE TO JUMP OVER THE PHENOMENON ITSELF
6788-96241-0018 WHICH ALONE GIVES MEANING TO THESE FORMS AND LAND IN THE BOUNDLESS SPHERE OF EMPTY FICTIONS BUT THIS ACTUAL WORLD OF EXPERIENCE IN WHICH WE ARE AND WHICH IS IN US REMAINS BOTH THE MATERIAL AND THE LIMITS OF OUR CONSIDERATION
6788-96241-0019 A WORLD WHICH IS SO RICH IN CONTENT THAT EVEN THE MOST SEARCHING INVESTIGATION OF WHICH THE HUMAN MIND IS CAPABLE COULD NOT EXHAUST IT
6788-96241-0020 SINCE THEN THE REAL WORLD OF EXPERIENCE WILL NEVER FAIL TO AFFORD MATERIAL AND REALITY TO OUR ETHICAL INVESTIGATIONS
6788-96241-0021 HOWEVER PLAUSIBLY DISGUISED BE HISTORICALLY COMPREHENDED IS INFINITELY FAR FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD YET THIS IS WHAT IS SUPPOSED WHENEVER A BECOMING OR A HAVING BECOME
6788-96241-0022 EITHER OPENLY OR DISGUISEDLY BOTH SOUGHT FOR AND FOUND AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO PHILOSOPHISES EVEN RECOGNISES HIS OWN POSITION ON THAT PATH SUCH HISTORICAL PHILOSOPHISING IN MOST CASES
6788-96241-0023 PRODUCES A COSMOGONY WHICH ADMITS OF MANY VARIETIES OR ELSE A SYSTEM OF EMANATIONS A DOCTRINE OF SUCCESSIVE DISENGAGEMENTS FROM ONE BEING OR FINALLY DRIVEN IN DESPAIR FROM FRUITLESS EFFORTS UPON THESE PATHS TO THE LAST PATH OF ALL
6788-96241-0024 WHICH IS MOST SHORTLY DISPOSED OF WITH THE REMARK THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT A WHOLE ETERNITY
6788-96241-0025 SO THAT EVERYTHING THAT CAN OR OUGHT TO BECOME MUST HAVE ALREADY DONE SO FOR ALL SUCH HISTORICAL PHILOSOPHY WHATEVER AIRS IT MAY GIVE ITSELF REGARDS TIME JUST AS IF KANT HAD NEVER LIVED
6788-96241-0026 AS A QUALITY OF THE THING IN ITSELF AND THUS STOPS AT THAT WHICH KANT CALLS THE PHENOMENON IN OPPOSITION TO THE THING IN ITSELF WHICH PLATO CALLS THE BECOMING AND NEVER BEING IN OPPOSITION TO THE BEING AND NEVER BECOMING AND WHICH FINALLY
6788-96241-0027 IS CALLED IN THE INDIAN PHILOSOPHY THE WEB OF MAYA IT IS JUST THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH BELONGS TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT REASON WITH WHICH NO ONE CAN PENETRATE TO THE INNER NATURE OF THINGS
6788-96241-0028 BUT ENDLESSLY PURSUES PHENOMENA MOVING WITHOUT END OR AIM LIKE A SQUIRREL IN ITS WHEEL TILL TIRED OUT AT LAST HE STOPS AT SOME POINT OR OTHER ARBITRARILY CHOSEN AND NOW DESIRES TO EXTORT RESPECT FOR IT FROM OTHERS ALSO
6788-96241-0029 THE GENUINE PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATION OF THE WORLD
6788-96241-0030 AND SO LEADS US BEYOND THE PHENOMENON IS PRECISELY THAT METHOD WHICH DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF WITH THE WHENCE THE WHITHER AND THE WHY OF THE WORLD BUT ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE DEMANDS ONLY THE WHAT
6788-96241-0031 THE METHOD WHICH CONSIDERS THINGS NOT ACCORDING TO ANY RELATION NOT AS BECOMING AND PASSING AWAY IN SHORT NOT ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE FOUR FORMS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT REASON
6788-96241-0032 BUT ON THE CONTRARY JUST THAT WHICH REMAINS WHEN ALL THAT BELONGS TO THE FORM OF KNOWLEDGE PROPER TO THAT PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN ABSTRACTED THE INNER NATURE OF THE WORLD WHICH ALWAYS APPEARS UNCHANGED IN ALL THE RELATIONS
6788-96241-0033 BUT IS ITSELF NEVER SUBJECT TO THEM AND HAS THE IDEAS OF THE WORLD AS ITS OBJECT OR MATERIAL FROM SUCH KNOWLEDGE AS THIS PROCEEDS PHILOSOPHY LIKE ART
