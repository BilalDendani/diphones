1171-134968-0000 IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE BROTHER HAD BEEN FORCED TO GIVE SOMETHING TO HIM AND HE WAS NOT BETTER PLEASED AT BEING ASKED NOW THAN HE GENERALLY WAS IF YOU WILL DO WHAT I ASK YOU
1171-134968-0001 YOU SHALL HAVE A WHOLE HAM SAID HE THE POOR ONE IMMEDIATELY THANKED HIM AND PROMISED THIS WELL HERE IS THE HAM AND NOW YOU MUST GO STRAIGHT TO DEAD MAN'S HALL SAID THE RICH BROTHER
1171-134968-0002 THROWING THE HAM TO HIM WELL I WILL DO WHAT I HAVE PROMISED SAID THE OTHER AND HE TOOK THE HAM AND SET OFF HE WENT ON AND ON FOR THE LIVELONG DAY AND AT NIGHTFALL HE CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT
1171-134968-0003 I HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS THE PLACE THOUGHT THE MAN WITH THE HAM AN OLD MAN WITH A LONG WHITE BEARD WAS STANDING IN THE OUTHOUSE CHOPPING YULE LOGS GOOD EVENING SAID THE MAN WITH THE HAM GOOD EVENING TO YOU
1171-134968-0004 WHERE ARE YOU GOING AT THIS LATE HOUR SAID THE MAN I AM GOING TO DEAD MAN'S HALL IF ONLY I AM ON THE RIGHT TRACK ANSWERED THE POOR MAN OH YES YOU ARE RIGHT ENOUGH FOR IT IS HERE SAID THE OLD MAN
1171-134968-0005 WHEN YOU GET INSIDE THEY WILL ALL WANT TO BUY YOUR HAM FOR THEY DON'T GET MUCH MEAT TO EAT THERE BUT YOU MUST NOT SELL IT UNLESS YOU CAN GET THE HAND MILL WHICH STANDS BEHIND THE DOOR FOR IT WHEN YOU COME OUT AGAIN
1171-134968-0006 EVERYTHING HAPPENED JUST AS THE OLD MAN HAD SAID IT WOULD ALL THE PEOPLE GREAT AND SMALL CAME ROUND HIM LIKE ANTS ON AN ANT HILL AND EACH TRIED TO OUTBID THE OTHER FOR THE HAM BY RIGHTS
1171-134968-0007 MY OLD WOMAN AND I OUGHT TO HAVE IT FOR OUR CHRISTMAS DINNER BUT SINCE YOU HAVE SET YOUR HEARTS UPON IT
1171-134968-0008 BUT IF I SELL IT I WILL HAVE THE HAND MILL WHICH IS STANDING THERE BEHIND THE DOOR AT FIRST THEY WOULD NOT HEAR OF THIS AND HAGGLED AND BARGAINED WITH THE MAN BUT HE STUCK TO WHAT HE HAD SAID
1171-134968-0009 AND THE PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO GIVE HIM THE HAND MILL WHEN THE MAN CAME OUT AGAIN INTO THE YARD HE ASKED THE OLD WOOD CUTTER HOW HE WAS TO STOP THE HAND MILL AND WHEN HE HAD LEARNED THAT HE THANKED HIM AND SET OFF HOME WITH ALL THE SPEED HE COULD
1171-134968-0010 BUT DID NOT GET THERE UNTIL AFTER THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK TWELVE ON CHRISTMAS EVE WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU BEEN SAID THE OLD WOMAN HERE I HAVE SAT WAITING HOUR AFTER HOUR
1171-134968-0011 AND HAVE NOT EVEN TWO STICKS TO LAY ACROSS EACH OTHER UNDER THE CHRISTMAS PORRIDGE POT OH I COULD NOT COME BEFORE I HAD SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE TO SEE ABOUT AND A LONG WAY TO GO TOO BUT NOW YOU SHALL JUST SEE SAID THE MAN
1171-134968-0012 BLESS ME SAID THE OLD WOMAN AS ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER APPEARED AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE HER HUSBAND HAD GOT THE MILL FROM BUT HE WOULD NOT TELL HER THAT NEVER MIND WHERE I GOT IT
1171-134968-0013 YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS A GOOD ONE AND THE WATER THAT TURNS IT WILL NEVER FREEZE SAID THE MAN SO HE GROUND MEAT AND DRINK AND ALL KINDS OF GOOD THINGS TO LAST ALL CHRISTMAS TIDE
1171-134968-0014 AND ON THE THIRD DAY HE INVITED ALL HIS FRIENDS TO COME TO A FEAST NOW WHEN THE RICH BROTHER SAW ALL THAT THERE WAS AT THE BANQUET AND IN THE HOUSE HE WAS BOTH VEXED AND ANGRY FOR HE GRUDGED EVERYTHING HIS BROTHER HAD
1171-134968-0015 ON CHRISTMAS EVE HE WAS SO POOR THAT HE CAME TO ME AND BEGGED FOR A TRIFLE FOR GOD'S SAKE AND NOW HE GIVES A FEAST AS IF HE WERE BOTH A COUNT AND A KING THOUGHT HE BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT YOUR RICHES FROM SAID HE TO HIS BROTHER
1171-134968-0016 FROM BEHIND THE DOOR SAID HE WHO OWNED THE MILL FOR HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO SATISFY HIS BROTHER ON THAT POINT BUT LATER IN THE EVENING WHEN HE HAD TAKEN A DROP TOO MUCH HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TELLING HOW HE HAD COME BY THE HAND MILL
1171-134968-0017 BUT HE HAD TO GIVE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT AND THE POOR BROTHER WAS TO KEEP IT TILL THE HAYMAKING WAS OVER FOR HE THOUGHT IF I KEEP IT AS LONG AS THAT I CAN MAKE IT GRIND MEAT AND DRINK THAT WILL LAST MANY A LONG YEAR
1171-134968-0018 DURING THAT TIME YOU MAY IMAGINE THAT THE MILL DID NOT GROW RUSTY AND WHEN HAY HARVEST CAME THE RICH BROTHER GOT IT BUT THE OTHER HAD TAKEN GOOD CARE NOT TO TEACH HIM HOW TO STOP IT
1171-134968-0019 IT WAS EVENING WHEN THE RICH MAN GOT THE MILL HOME AND IN THE MORNING HE BADE THE OLD WOMAN GO OUT AND SPREAD THE HAY AFTER THE MOWERS AND HE WOULD ATTEND TO THE HOUSE HIMSELF THAT DAY HE SAID SO
1171-134968-0020 WHEN DINNER TIME DREW NEAR HE SET THE MILL ON THE KITCHEN TABLE AND SAID GRIND HERRINGS AND MILK POTTAGE AND DO IT BOTH QUICKLY AND WELL SO THE MILL BEGAN TO GRIND HERRINGS AND MILK POTTAGE
1171-134968-0021 AND FIRST ALL THE DISHES AND TUBS WERE FILLED AND THEN IT CAME OUT ALL OVER THE KITCHEN FLOOR THE MAN TWISTED AND TURNED IT AND DID ALL HE COULD TO MAKE THE MILL STOP BUT HOWSOEVER HE TURNED IT AND SCREWED IT THE MILL WENT ON GRINDING
1171-134968-0022 AND IN A SHORT TIME THE POTTAGE ROSE SO HIGH THAT THE MAN WAS LIKE TO BE DROWNED SO HE THREW OPEN THE PARLOR DOOR BUT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE MILL HAD GROUND THE PARLOR FULL TOO
1171-134968-0023 AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY AND DANGER THAT THE MAN COULD GO THROUGH THE STREAM OF POTTAGE AND GET HOLD OF THE DOOR LATCH WHEN HE GOT THE DOOR OPEN HE DID NOT STAY LONG IN THE ROOM BUT RAN OUT AND THE HERRINGS AND POTTAGE CAME AFTER HIM
1171-134968-0024 AND IT STREAMED OUT OVER BOTH FARM AND FIELD NOW THE OLD WOMAN WHO WAS OUT SPREADING THE HAY BEGAN TO THINK DINNER WAS LONG IN COMING AND SAID TO THE WOMEN AND THE MOWERS THOUGH THE MASTER DOES NOT CALL US HOME
1171-134968-0025 WE MAY AS WELL GO IT MAY BE THAT HE FINDS HE IS NOT GOOD AT MAKING POTTAGE AND I SHOULD DO WELL TO HELP HIM SO THEY BEGAN TO STRAGGLE HOMEWARD BUT WHEN THEY HAD GOT A LITTLE WAY UP THE HILL
1171-134968-0026 THEY MET THE HERRINGS AND POTTAGE AND BREAD ALL POURING FORTH AND WINDING ABOUT ONE OVER THE OTHER AND THE MAN HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE FLOOD WOULD TO HEAVEN THAT EACH OF YOU HAD A HUNDRED STOMACHS
1171-134968-0027 TAKE CARE THAT YOU ARE NOT DROWNED IN THE POTTAGE HE CRIED AS HE WENT BY THEM AS IF MISCHIEF WERE AT HIS HEELS DOWN TO WHERE HIS BROTHER DWELT THEN HE BEGGED HIM FOR GOD'S SAKE TO TAKE THE MILL BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN AN INSTANT
1171-134968-0028 NOW THE POOR BROTHER HAD BOTH THE MONEY AND THE MILL AGAIN SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE HAD A FARMHOUSE MUCH FINER THAN THAT IN WHICH HIS BROTHER LIVED BUT THE MILL GROUND HIM SO MUCH MONEY
1171-134968-0029 THAT HE COVERED IT WITH PLATES OF GOLD AND THE FARMHOUSE LAY CLOSE BY THE SEA SHORE SO IT SHONE AND GLITTERED FAR OUT TO SEA
1171-134968-0030 AND EVERYONE WANTED TO SEE THE WONDERFUL MILL FOR THE REPORT OF IT SPREAD FAR AND WIDE AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHO HAD NOT HEARD TELL OF IT AFTER A LONG LONG TIME
1171-134968-0031 HE ASKED IF IT COULD MAKE SALT YES IT COULD MAKE SALT SAID HE WHO OWNED IT AND WHEN THE SKIPPER HEARD THAT HE WISHED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND MAIN TO HAVE THE MILL LET IT COST WHAT IT MIGHT
1171-134968-0032 FOR HE THOUGHT IF HE HAD IT HE WOULD GET OFF HAVING TO SAIL FAR AWAY OVER THE PERILOUS SEA FOR FREIGHTS OF SALT AT FIRST THE MAN WOULD NOT HEAR OF PARTING WITH IT BUT THE SKIPPER BEGGED AND PRAYED
1171-134968-0033 AND AT LAST THE MAN SOLD IT TO HIM AND GOT MANY MANY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT WHEN THE SKIPPER HAD GOT THE MILL ON HIS BACK HE DID NOT STAY THERE LONG FOR HE WAS SO AFRAID THAT THE MAN WOULD CHANGE HIS MIND AND HE HAD NO TIME TO ASK HOW HE WAS TO STOP IT GRINDING
1171-134968-0034 BUT GOT ON BOARD HIS SHIP AS FAST AS HE COULD WHEN HE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY OUT TO SEA HE TOOK THE MILL ON DECK GRIND SALT AND GRIND BOTH QUICKLY AND WELL SAID THE SKIPPER SO THE MILL
1171-134968-0035 AND THE HEAP OF SALT GREW HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL AT LAST THE SHIP SANK THERE LIES THE MILL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND STILL DAY BY DAY IT GRINDS ON
