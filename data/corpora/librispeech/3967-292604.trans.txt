3967-292604-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN TELLS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENT IN CULLEN MAYLE'S BEDROOM I WAS VERY TIRED BUT IN SPITE OF MY FATIGUE IT WAS SOME WHILE BEFORE I FELL ASLEEP
3967-292604-0001 PARMITER HAD THROWN A NEW LIGHT UPON THE BUSINESS TONIGHT AND BY THE HELP OF THAT LIGHT I ARRAYED AFRESH MY SCANTY KNOWLEDGE THE STRANGENESS OF MY POSITION BESIDES KEPT ME IN SOME EXCITEMENT
3967-292604-0002 CLUTTERBUCK MIGHT WELL TALK ABOUT IMPERTINENCE AND I COULD NOT BUT WONDER WHAT IN THE WORLD I SHOULD FIND TO SAY IF DICK WAS LATE IN THE MORNING FINALLY THERE WAS THE ADVENTURE OF THAT NIGHT
3967-292604-0003 I FELT MYSELF AGAIN SLIPPING DOWN THE WET GRASS AND DANGLING OVER THE PRECIPICE I HEARD AGAIN THAT UNEARTHLY SCREECHING WHICH HAD SO FRIGHTENED DICK AND PERPLEXED ME IT PERPLEXED ME STILL
3967-292604-0004 I COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT ENTERTAIN DICK'S SUPPOSITION OF A SPIRIT THIS WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND I HAD COME FRESH FROM LONDON GHOSTS AND BOGIES MIGHT DO VERY WELL FOR THE ISLAND OF TRESCO
3967-292604-0005 BUT MISTER BERKELEY WAS NOT TO BE TERRIFIED WITH ANY SUCH OLD WIVES STORIES AND SO MISTER BERKELEY FELL ASLEEP AT WHAT PRECISE HOUR THE THING HAPPENED I DO NOT KNOW
3967-292604-0006 THE ROOM WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD NOT HAVE READ MY WATCH EVEN IF I HAD LOOKED AT IT WHICH I DID NOT THINK TO DO BUT AT SOME TIME DURING THAT NIGHT I WOKE UP QUITE SUDDENLY WITH A CLEAR SENSE THAT I HAD BEEN WAKED UP
3967-292604-0007 I SAT UP IN MY BED WITH MY HEART BEATING VERY QUICK
3967-292604-0008 THE FOG WAS STILL THICK ABOUT THE HOUSE SO THAT HARDLY A GLIMMER OF LIGHT CAME FROM THE WINDOW BUT THERE WAS SOME ONE IN THE ROOM I KNEW FOR I COULD HEAR A RUSTLE AS OF STEALTHY MOVEMENTS
3967-292604-0009 AND THEN STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF ME BETWEEN THE TWO POSTS OF THE BED FOOT I SAW SOMETHING WHITE THAT WAVERED AND SWAYED THIS WAY AND THAT
3967-292604-0010 ONLY AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE I HAD BEEN BOASTING TO MYSELF THAT I WAS LONDON BRED AND LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BUT NONE THE LESS MY HAIR STIRRED UPON MY HEAD
3967-292604-0011 AND ALL THE MOISTURE DRIED UP IN MY THROAT AS I STARED AT THAT DIM WHITE THING WAVERING AND SWAYING BETWEEN THE BED POSTS IT WAS TALLER THAN ANY HUMAN BEING THAT I HAD SEEN
3967-292604-0012 I REMEMBERED THE WEIRD SCREECHING SOUND WHICH I HAD HEARD IN THE HOLLOW I THINK THAT IN MY HEART I BEGGED DICK PARMITER'S PARDON FOR LAUGHING AT HIS FEARS
3967-292604-0013 I KNOW THAT I CROUCHED BACK AMONG THE HANGINGS AND SHUDDERED TILL THE BED SHOOK AND SHOOK AGAIN AND THEN IT MADE A SOUND AND ALL THE BLOOD IN MY VEINS STOOD STILL I THOUGHT THAT MY HEART WOULD STOP OR MY BRAIN BURST
3967-292604-0014 FOR THE SOUND WAS NEITHER A SCREECH LIKE THAT WHICH ROSE FROM THE HOLLOW NOR A GROAN NOR ANY GHOSTLY NOISE IT WAS PURELY HUMAN IT WAS A KECKING SOUND IN THE THROAT SUCH AS ONE MAKES WHO GASPS FOR BREATH
3967-292604-0015 THE WHITE THING WAS A LIVE THING OF FLESH AND BLOOD I SPRANG UP ON THE BED AND JUMPED TO THE FOOT OF IT IT WAS VERY DARK IN THE ROOM BUT THROUGH THE DARKNESS I COULD SEE ON A LEVEL WITH MY FACE THE FACE OF A WOMAN
3967-292604-0016 HER EYES WERE OPEN AND THEY STARED INTO MINE I COULD SEE THE WHITES OF THEM OUR HEADS WERE SO NEAR THEY ALMOST TOUCHED EVEN THEN I DID NOT UNDERSTAND I WONDERED WHAT IT WAS ON WHICH SHE STOOD
3967-292604-0017 I NOTICED A STREAK OF WHITE WHICH RAN STRAIGHT UP TOWARDS THE CEILING FROM BEHIND HER HEAD AND I WONDERED WHAT THAT WAS AND THEN SUDDENLY HER BODY SWUNG AGAINST MY LEGS SHE WAS STANDING ON NOTHING WHATEVER
3967-292604-0018 AGAIN THE QUEER GASPING COUGHING NOISE BROKE FROM HER LIPS AND AT LAST I UNDERSTOOD IT IT WAS A GASP OF A WOMAN STRANGLING TO DEATH THAT WHITE STIFF STREAK ABOVE HER HEAD I KNEW WHAT IT WAS TOO
3967-292604-0019 I CAUGHT HER BY THE WAIST AND LIFTED HER UP TILL HER WEIGHT RESTED UPON MY ARM WITH THE OTHER ARM I FELT ABOUT HER NECK A THICK SOFT SCARF SILK IT SEEMED TO THE TOUCH WAS KNOTTED TIGHTLY ROUND IT
3967-292604-0020 AND THE END OF THE SCARF RAN UP TO THE CROSS BEAM ABOVE THE BED POSTS THE SCARF WAS THE STREAK OF WHITE I FUMBLED AT THE KNOT WITH MY FINGERS IT WAS A SLIP KNOT AND NOW THAT NO WEIGHT KEPT IT TAUT IT LOOSENED EASILY
3967-292604-0021 I SLIPPED THE NOOSE BACK OVER HER HEAD AND LEFT IT DANGLING THE WOMAN I LAID DOWN UPON THE BED WHERE SHE LAY CHOKING AND MOANING I FLUNG UP THE WINDOW AND THE COLD FOG POURED INTO THE ROOM
3967-292604-0022 I HAD NO CANDLE TO LIGHT AND NOTHING WHEREWITH TO LIGHT IT BUT I REMEMBERED THAT MY FOOT HAD KNOCKED AGAINST A CHAIR TO THE RIGHT OF THE WINDOW AS I CLIMBED INTO THE ROOM I GROPED FOR THE CHAIR AND SET IT TO FACE THE OPEN NIGHT
3967-292604-0023 THEN I CARRIED THE WOMAN TO THE WINDOW AND PLACED HER IN THE CHAIR AND SUPPORTED HER SO THAT SHE MIGHT NOT FALL OUTSIDE I COULD HEAR THE SURF BOOMING UPON THE SAND ALMOST WITHIN ARM'S REACH AND THE AIR WAS BRISK WITH THE SALT OF THE SEA
3967-292604-0024 SUCH LIGHT AS THERE WAS GLIMMERED UPON THE WOMAN'S FACE I SAW THAT SHE WAS YOUNG LITTLE MORE THAN A GIRL INDEED WITH HAIR AND EYES OF AN EXTREME BLACKNESS
3967-292604-0025 SHE WAS OF A SLIGHT FIGURE AS I KNEW FROM THE EASE WITH WHICH I CARRIED HER BUT TALL I COULD NOT DOUBT WHO IT WAS FOR ONE THING THE WHITE DRESS SHE WORE WAS OF SOME FINE SOFT FABRIC
3967-292604-0026 AND EVEN IN THAT LIGHT IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL I HELD HER THUS WITH THE COLD SALT AIR BLOWING UPON HER FACE AND IN A LITTLE SHE BEGAN TO RECOVER SHE MOVED HER HANDS UPON HER LAP
3967-292604-0027 AND FINALLY LIFTED ONE AND HELD HER THROAT WITH IT VERY LIKELY THERE WILL BE SOME WATER IN THE ROOM SAID I IF YOU ARE SAFE IF YOU WILL NOT FALL I WILL LOOK FOR IT THANK YOU SHE MURMURED
3967-292604-0028 MY PRESENCE OCCASIONED HER NO SURPRISE AND THIS I THOUGHT WAS NO MORE THAN NATURAL AT THE MOMENT I TOOK MY ARM FROM HER WAIST AND GROPED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR THE WATER JUG I FOUND IT AT LAST AND A GLASS BESIDE IT
3967-292604-0029 THESE I CARRIED BACK TO THE WINDOW THE GIRL WAS STILL SEATED ON THE CHAIR BUT SHE HAD CHANGED HER ATTITUDE SHE HAD LEANED HER ARMS UPON THE SILL AND HER HEAD UPON HER ARMS
3967-292604-0030 I POURED OUT THE WATER FROM THE JUG INTO THE TUMBLER SHE DID NOT RAISE HER HEAD I SPOKE TO HER SHE DID NOT ANSWER ME A HORRIBLE FEAR TURNED ME COLD
3967-292604-0031 I KNELT DOWN BY HER SIDE AND SETTING DOWN THE WATER GENTLY LIFTED HER HEAD SHE DID NOT RESIST BUT SANK BACK WITH A NATURAL MOVEMENT INTO MY ARMS HER EYES WERE CLOSED BUT SHE WAS BREATHING
3967-292604-0032 I COULD FEEL HER BREATH UPON MY CHEEK AND IT CAME STEADILY AND REGULAR I CANNOT DESCRIBE MY ASTONISHMENT SHE WAS IN A DEEP SLEEP I PONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHAT I SHOULD DO SHOULD I WAKE THE HOUSEHOLD
3967-292604-0033 SHOULD I EXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE FOR HELEN MAYLE'S SAKE I MUST NOT DO THAT SINCE HELEN MAYLE IT SURELY WAS WHOM I HELD IN MY ARMS I PROPPED HER SECURELY IN THE CHAIR THEN CROSSED THE ROOM
3967-292604-0034 OPENED THE DOOR AND LISTENED THE HOUSE WAS VERY STILL SO FAR NO ONE HAD BEEN DISTURBED A LONG NARROW PASSAGE STRETCHED IN FRONT OF ME WITH DOORS UPON EITHER SIDE
3967-292604-0035 REMEMBERING WHAT DICK PARMITER HAD TOLD ME I MEAN THAT EVERY SOUND REVERBERATED THROUGH THE HOUSE I CREPT DOWN THE LANDING ON TIPTOE I HAD ONLY MY STOCKINGS UPON MY FEET
3967-292604-0036 AND I CREPT FORWARD SO CAREFULLY THAT I COULD NOT HEAR MY OWN FOOTFALLS I HAD TAKEN SOME TWENTY PACES WHEN THE PASSAGE OPENED OUT TO MY RIGHT I PUT OUT MY HAND AND TOUCHED A BALUSTRADE
3967-292604-0037 A FEW YARDS FARTHER ON THE BALUSTRADE CEASED THERE WAS AN EMPTY SPACE WHICH I TOOK TO BE THE BEGINNING OF THE STAIRS AND BEYOND THE EMPTY SPACE THE PASSAGE CLOSED IN AGAIN I CREPT FORWARD
3967-292604-0038 AND AT LAST AT THE FAR END OF THE HOUSE AND ON THE LEFT HAND OF THE PASSAGE I CAME TO THAT FOR WHICH I SEARCHED AND WHICH I BARELY HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN DOOR I HELD MY BREATH AND LISTENED IN THE DOORWAY
3967-292604-0039 BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF ANY ONE BREATHING SO I STEPPED INTO THE ROOM THE FOG WAS LESS DENSE IT HUNG OUTSIDE THE WINDOW A THIN WHITE MIST AND BEHIND THAT MIST THE DAY WAS BREAKING I LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM
3967-292604-0040 IT WAS A LARGE BEDROOM AND THE BED HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN A GLANCE AT THE TOILETTE WITH ITS DAINTY KNICK KNACKS OF SILVER PROVED TO ME THAT IT WAS A WOMAN'S BEDROOM IT HAD TWO BIG WINDOWS LOOKING OUT TOWARDS THE SEA
3967-292604-0041 AND AS I STOOD IN THE DIM GREY LIGHT I WONDERED WHETHER IT WAS FROM ONE OF THOSE WINDOWS THAT ADAM MAYLE HAD LOOKED YEARS BEFORE AND SEEN THE BRIGANTINE BREAKING UP UPON THE GOLDEN BALL REEF
3967-292604-0042 BUT THE LIGHT WAS BROADENING WITH THE PASSAGE OF EVERY MINUTE WITH THE SAME CAUTION WHICH I HAD OBSERVED BEFORE I STOLE BACK ON TIPTOE TO CULLEN MAYLE'S ROOM HELEN MAYLE WAS STILL ASLEEP AND SHE HAD NOT MOVED FROM HER POSTURE
3967-292604-0043 I RAISED HER IN MY ARMS AND STILL SHE DID NOT WAKE I CARRIED HER DOWN THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AND LAID HER ON THE BED THERE WAS A COVERLET FOLDED AT THE END OF THE BED AND I SPREAD IT OVER HER
3967-292604-0044 SHE NESTLED DOWN BENEATH IT AND HER LIPS SMILED VERY PRETTILY AND SHE UTTERED A LITTLE PURRING MURMUR OF CONTENT BUT THIS SHE DID IN HER SLEEP SHE SLEPT WITH THE UNTROUBLED SLEEP OF A CHILD
3967-292604-0045 HER FACE WAS PALE BUT THAT I TOOK TO BE ITS NATURAL COMPLEXION HER LONG BLACK EYELASHES RESTED UPON HER CHEEKS THERE WAS NO HINT OF ANY TROUBLE IN HER EXPRESSION NO TRACE OF ANY PASSIONATE DESPAIR
3967-292604-0046 I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE GIRL WHO HAD SOUGHT TO HANG HERSELF WHOM I HAD SEEN STRUGGLING FOR HER BREATH YET THERE WAS NO DOUBT POSSIBLE SHE HAD COME INTO THE EMPTY ROOM
3967-292604-0047 HAD NOT A FISHER BOY BURST ONE NIGHT INTO LIEUTENANT CLUTTERBUCK'S LODGING OFF THE STRAND
