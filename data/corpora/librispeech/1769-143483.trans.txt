1769-143483-0000 A DISCOURSE UPON THE ORIGIN AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE INEQUALITY AMONG MANKIND
1769-143483-0001 INTRODUCTORY NOTE JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU WAS BORN AT GENEVA JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH SEVENTEEN TWELVE THE SON OF A WATCHMAKER OF FRENCH ORIGIN HIS EDUCATION WAS IRREGULAR
1769-143483-0002 HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT HIMSELF IN ANY OF THEM THE DISCOVERY OF HIS TALENT AS A WRITER CAME WITH THE WINNING OF A PRIZE OFFERED BY THE ACADEMY OF DIJON FOR A DISCOURSE ON THE QUESTION WHETHER THE PROGRESS OF THE SCIENCES AND OF LETTERS
1769-143483-0003 WAS WRITTEN IN A SIMILAR COMPETITION HE NOW CONCENTRATED HIS POWERS UPON LITERATURE PRODUCING TWO NOVELS
1769-143483-0004 A WORK WHICH HAS HAD ENORMOUS INFLUENCE ON THE THEORY AND PRACTISE OF PEDAGOGY DOWN TO OUR OWN TIME
1769-143483-0005 ELABORATED THE DOCTRINE OF THE DISCOURSE ON INEQUALITY BOTH HISTORICALLY AND PHILOSOPHICALLY IT IS UNSOUND BUT IT WAS THE CHIEF LITERARY SOURCE OF THE ENTHUSIASM FOR LIBERTY FRATERNITY AND EQUALITY WHICH INSPIRED THE LEADERS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
1769-143483-0006 IS OFTEN UNPLEASING IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE BUT IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT AUTOBIOGRAPHIES OF THE WORLD DURING ROUSSEAU'S LATER YEARS HE WAS THE VICTIM OF THE DELUSION OF PERSECUTION
1769-143483-0007 HE CAME TO DISTRUST AND QUARREL WITH EACH IN TURN HE DIED AT ERMENONVILLE NEAR PARIS JULY SECOND SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE MOST WIDELY INFLUENTIAL FRENCH WRITER OF HIS AGE
1769-143483-0008 BECAUSE HE WISHES TO EXHIBIT HIS PRINCIPLES AS THOSE WHICH SHOULD BE TAUGHT BUT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAY IN WHICH RELIGIOUS MATTERS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH THE YOUNG NEVERTHELESS IT IS UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED THAT THESE OPINIONS ARE ROUSSEAU'S OWN
1769-143483-0009 AND REPRESENT IN SHORT FORM HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TOWARD RELIGIOUS BELIEF
1769-143483-0010 A DISCOURSE UPON THE ORIGIN AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE INEQUALITY AMONG MANKIND TIS OF MAN I AM TO SPEAK AND THE VERY QUESTION IN ANSWER TO WHICH I AM TO SPEAK OF HIM
1769-143483-0011 SUFFICIENTLY INFORMS ME THAT I AM GOING TO SPEAK TO MEN FOR TO THOSE ALONE WHO ARE NOT AFRAID OF HONOURING TRUTH IT BELONGS TO PROPOSE DISCUSSIONS OF THIS KIND
1769-143483-0012 I CONCEIVE TWO SPECIES OF INEQUALITY AMONG MEN ONE WHICH I CALL NATURAL OR PHYSICAL INEQUALITY BECAUSE IT IS ESTABLISHED BY NATURE AND CONSISTS IN THE DIFFERENCE OF AGE
1769-143483-0013 OTHERS WITHOUT FURTHER CEREMONY ASCRIBING TO THE STRONGEST AN AUTHORITY OVER THE WEAKEST HAVE IMMEDIATELY STRUCK OUT GOVERNMENT WITHOUT THINKING OF THE TIME REQUISITE FOR MEN TO FORM ANY NOTION OF THE THINGS SIGNIFIED BY THE WORDS AUTHORITY AND GOVERNMENT
1769-143483-0014 ALL OF THEM IN FINE CONSTANTLY HARPING ON WANTS AVIDITY OPPRESSION DESIRES AND PRIDE HAVE TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE OF NATURE IDEAS PICKED UP IN THE BOSOM OF SOCIETY
1769-143483-0015 THOUGH IT PLAINLY APPEARS BY SACRED HISTORY THAT EVEN THE FIRST MAN IMMEDIATELY FURNISHED AS HE WAS BY GOD HIMSELF WITH BOTH INSTRUCTIONS AND PRECEPTS NEVER LIVED IN THAT STATE
1769-143483-0016 LIKE THOSE SYSTEMS WHICH OUR NATURALISTS DAILY MAKE OF THE FORMATION OF THE WORLD RELIGION COMMANDS US TO BELIEVE THAT MEN HAVING BEEN DRAWN BY GOD HIMSELF OUT OF A STATE OF NATURE ARE UNEQUAL BECAUSE IT IS HIS PLEASURE THEY SHOULD BE SO
1769-143483-0017 BUT RELIGION DOES NOT FORBID US TO DRAW CONJECTURES SOLELY FROM THE NATURE OF MAN CONSIDERED IN ITSELF AND FROM THAT OF THE BEINGS WHICH SURROUND HIM CONCERNING THE FATE OF MANKIND HAD THEY BEEN LEFT TO THEMSELVES THIS IS THEN THE QUESTION I AM TO ANSWER
1769-143483-0018 THE QUESTION I PROPOSE TO EXAMINE IN THE PRESENT DISCOURSE AS MANKIND IN GENERAL HAVE AN INTEREST IN MY SUBJECT I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO USE A LANGUAGE SUITABLE TO ALL NATIONS OR RATHER FORGETTING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF TIME AND PLACE IN ORDER TO THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE MEN I SPEAK TO
1769-143483-0019 THE TIMES I AM GOING TO SPEAK OF ARE VERY REMOTE HOW MUCH YOU ARE CHANGED FROM WHAT YOU ONCE WERE TIS IN A MANNER THE LIFE OF YOUR SPECIES THAT I AM GOING TO WRITE FROM THE QUALITIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECEIVED
