7065-74598-0000 THIS WILL APPEAR BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS FIRST THAT IN THE PASSAGE OF LIGHT OUT OF GLASS INTO AIR THERE IS A REFLEXION AS STRONG
7065-74598-0001 AND BY MANY DEGREES STRONGER THAN IN ITS PASSAGE OUT OF GLASS INTO WATER AND IT SEEMS NOT PROBABLE THAT AIR SHOULD HAVE MORE STRONGLY REFLECTING PARTS THAN WATER OR GLASS BUT IF THAT SHOULD POSSIBLY BE SUPPOSED
7065-74598-0002 YET IT WILL AVAIL NOTHING FOR THE REFLEXION IS AS STRONG OR STRONGER WHEN THE AIR IS DRAWN AWAY FROM THE GLASS SUPPOSE BY THE AIR PUMP INVENTED BY OTTO GUERIET AND IMPROVED AND MADE USEFUL BY MISTER BOYLE
7065-74598-0003 AS WHEN IT IS ADJACENT TO IT SECONDLY IF LIGHT IN ITS PASSAGE OUT OF GLASS INTO AIR BE INCIDENT MORE OBLIQUELY THAN AT AN ANGLE OF FORTY OR FORTY ONE DEGREES IT IS WHOLLY REFLECTED IF LESS OBLIQUELY
7065-74598-0004 IT IS IN GREAT MEASURE TRANSMITTED NOW IT IS NOT TO BE IMAGINED THAT LIGHT AT ONE DEGREE OF OBLIQUITY SHOULD MEET WITH PORES ENOUGH IN THE AIR TO TRANSMIT THE GREATER PART OF IT
7065-74598-0005 SHOULD MEET WITH NOTHING BUT PARTS TO REFLECT IT WHOLLY ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT IN ITS PASSAGE OUT OF AIR INTO GLASS HOW OBLIQUE SOEVER BE ITS INCIDENCE IT FINDS PORES ENOUGH IN THE GLASS TO TRANSMIT A GREAT PART OF IT
7065-74598-0006 IF ANY MAN SUPPOSE THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTED BY THE AIR BUT BY THE OUTMOST SUPERFICIAL PARTS OF THE GLASS THERE IS STILL THE SAME DIFFICULTY BESIDES THAT SUCH A SUPPOSITION IS UNINTELLIGIBLE
7065-74598-0007 AND WILL ALSO APPEAR TO BE FALSE BY APPLYING WATER BEHIND SOME PART OF THE GLASS INSTEAD OF AIR FOR SO IN A CONVENIENT OBLIQUITY OF THE RAYS SUPPOSE OF FORTY FIVE OR FORTY SIX DEGREES
7065-74598-0008 AT WHICH THEY ARE ALL REFLECTED WHERE THE AIR IS ADJACENT TO THE GLASS THEY SHALL BE IN GREAT MEASURE TRANSMITTED WHERE THE WATER IS ADJACENT TO IT WHICH ARGUES THAT THEIR REFLEXION OR TRANSMISSION DEPENDS ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE AIR
7065-74598-0009 AND WATER BEHIND THE GLASS AND NOT ON THE STRIKING OF THE RAYS UPON THE PARTS OF THE GLASS THIRDLY
7065-74598-0010 PLACED AT THE ENTRANCE OF A BEAM OF LIGHT INTO A DARKEN'D ROOM BE SUCCESSIVELY CAST ON A SECOND PRISM PLACED AT A GREATER DISTANCE FROM THE FORMER IN SUCH MANNER THAT THEY ARE ALL ALIKE INCIDENT UPON IT THE SECOND PRISM
7065-74598-0011 MAY BE SO INCLINED TO THE INCIDENT RAYS THAT THOSE WHICH ARE OF A BLUE COLOUR SHALL BE ALL REFLECTED BY IT AND YET THOSE OF A RED COLOUR PRETTY COPIOUSLY TRANSMITTED NOW IF THE REFLEXION BE CAUSED BY THE PARTS OF AIR OR GLASS I WOULD ASK
7065-74598-0012 WHY AT THE SAME OBLIQUITY OF INCIDENCE THE BLUE SHOULD WHOLLY IMPINGE ON THOSE PARTS SO AS TO BE ALL REFLECTED AND YET THE RED FIND PORES ENOUGH TO BE IN A GREAT MEASURE TRANSMITTED FOURTHLY
7065-74598-0013 WHERE TWO GLASSES TOUCH ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO SENSIBLE REFLEXION AS WAS DECLARED IN THE FIRST OBSERVATION AND YET I SEE NO REASON WHY THE RAYS SHOULD NOT IMPINGE ON THE PARTS OF GLASS AS MUCH WHEN CONTIGUOUS TO OTHER GLASS
7065-74598-0014 AS WHEN CONTIGUOUS TO AIR FIFTHLY WHEN THE TOP OF A WATER BUBBLE IN THE SEVENTEENTH OBSERVATION BY THE CONTINUAL SUBSIDING AND EXHALING OF THE WATER GREW VERY THIN
7065-74598-0015 THERE WAS SUCH A LITTLE AND ALMOST INSENSIBLE QUANTITY OF LIGHT REFLECTED FROM IT THAT IT APPEARED INTENSELY BLACK WHEREAS ROUND ABOUT THAT BLACK SPOT WHERE THE WATER WAS THICKER THE REFLEXION WAS SO STRONG AS TO MAKE THE WATER SEEM VERY WHITE
7065-74598-0016 NOR IS IT ONLY AT THE LEAST THICKNESS OF THIN PLATES OR BUBBLES THAT THERE IS NO MANIFEST REFLEXION BUT AT MANY OTHER THICKNESSES CONTINUALLY GREATER AND GREATER FOR IN THE FIFTEENTH OBSERVATION THE RAYS OF THE SAME COLOUR
7065-74598-0017 WERE BY TURNS TRANSMITTED AT ONE THICKNESS AND REFLECTED AT ANOTHER THICKNESS FOR AN INDETERMINATE NUMBER OF SUCCESSIONS AND YET
7065-74598-0018 WHERE IT IS OF ANY ONE THICKNESS THERE ARE AS MANY PARTS FOR THE RAYS TO IMPINGE ON AS WHERE IT IS OF ANY OTHER THICKNESS SIXTHLY IF REFLEXION WERE CAUSED BY THE PARTS OF REFLECTING BODIES
7065-74598-0019 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIN PLATES OR BUBBLES AT ONE AND THE SAME PLACE TO REFLECT THE RAYS OF ONE COLOUR AND TRANSMIT THOSE OF ANOTHER AS THEY DO ACCORDING TO THE THIRTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH OBSERVATIONS FOR IT IS NOT TO BE IMAGINED
7065-74598-0020 THAT AT ONE PLACE THE RAYS WHICH FOR INSTANCE EXHIBIT A BLUE COLOUR SHOULD HAVE THE FORTUNE TO DASH UPON THE PARTS AND THOSE WHICH EXHIBIT A RED TO HIT UPON THE PORES OF THE BODY AND THEN AT ANOTHER PLACE WHERE THE BODY IS EITHER A LITTLE THICKER OR A LITTLE THINNER
7065-74598-0021 THAT ON THE CONTRARY THE BLUE SHOULD HIT UPON ITS PORES AND THE RED UPON ITS PARTS LASTLY WERE THE RAYS OF LIGHT REFLECTED BY IMPINGING ON THE SOLID PARTS OF BODIES THEIR REFLEXIONS FROM POLISH'D BODIES
7065-74598-0022 COULD NOT BE SO REGULAR AS THEY ARE FOR IN POLISHING GLASS WITH SAND PUTTY OR TRIPOLY IT IS NOT TO BE IMAGINED THAT THOSE SUBSTANCES CAN BY GRATING AND FRETTING THE GLASS
7065-74598-0023 BRING ALL ITS LEAST PARTICLES TO AN ACCURATE POLISH SO THAT ALL THEIR SURFACES SHALL BE TRULY PLAIN OR TRULY SPHERICAL AND LOOK ALL THE SAME WAY SO AS TOGETHER TO COMPOSE ONE EVEN SURFACE
7065-74598-0024 THE SMALLER THE PARTICLES OF THOSE SUBSTANCES ARE THE SMALLER WILL BE THE SCRATCHES BY WHICH THEY CONTINUALLY FRET AND WEAR AWAY THE GLASS UNTIL IT BE POLISH'D BUT BE THEY NEVER SO SMALL
7065-74598-0025 THEY CAN WEAR AWAY THE GLASS NO OTHERWISE THAN BY GRATING AND SCRATCHING IT AND BREAKING THE PROTUBERANCES AND THEREFORE POLISH IT NO OTHERWISE THAN BY BRINGING ITS ROUGHNESS TO A VERY FINE GRAIN
7065-74598-0026 SO THAT THE SCRATCHES AND FRETTINGS OF THE SURFACE BECOME TOO SMALL TO BE VISIBLE AND THEREFORE IF LIGHT WERE REFLECTED BY IMPINGING UPON THE SOLID PARTS OF THE GLASS IT WOULD BE SCATTER'D AS MUCH BY THE MOST POLISH'D GLASS AS BY THE ROUGHEST
7065-74598-0027 SO THEN IT REMAINS A PROBLEM HOW GLASS POLISH'D BY FRETTING SUBSTANCES CAN REFLECT LIGHT SO REGULARLY AS IT DOES AND THIS PROBLEM IS SCARCE OTHERWISE TO BE SOLVED THAN BY SAYING THAT THE REFLEXION OF A RAY IS EFFECTED
7065-74598-0028 NOT BY A SINGLE POINT OF THE REFLECTING BODY BUT BY SOME POWER OF THE BODY WHICH IS EVENLY DIFFUSED ALL OVER ITS SURFACE AND BY WHICH IT ACTS UPON THE RAY WITHOUT IMMEDIATE CONTACT
7065-74598-0029 FOR THAT THE PARTS OF BODIES DO ACT UPON LIGHT AT A DISTANCE SHALL BE SHEWN HEREAFTER NOW IF LIGHT BE REFLECTED NOT BY IMPINGING ON THE SOLID PARTS OF BODIES BUT BY SOME OTHER PRINCIPLE
7065-74598-0030 IT'S PROBABLE THAT AS MANY OF ITS RAYS AS IMPINGE ON THE SOLID PARTS OF BODIES ARE NOT REFLECTED BUT STIFLED AND LOST IN THE BODIES FOR OTHERWISE WE MUST ALLOW TWO SORTS OF REFLEXIONS
7065-74598-0031 SHOULD ALL THE RAYS BE REFLECTED WHICH IMPINGE ON THE INTERNAL PARTS OF CLEAR WATER OR CRYSTAL THOSE SUBSTANCES WOULD RATHER HAVE A CLOUDY COLOUR THAN A CLEAR TRANSPARENCY TO MAKE BODIES LOOK BLACK IT'S NECESSARY THAT MANY RAYS BE STOPP'D
7065-74598-0032 RETAINED AND LOST IN THEM AND IT SEEMS NOT PROBABLE THAT ANY RAYS CAN BE STOPP'D AND STIFLED IN THEM WHICH DO NOT IMPINGE ON THEIR PARTS
7065-74598-0033 AND HENCE WE MAY UNDERSTAND THAT BODIES ARE MUCH MORE RARE AND POROUS THAN IS COMMONLY BELIEVED WATER IS NINETEEN TIMES LIGHTER AND BY CONSEQUENCE NINETEEN TIMES RARER THAN GOLD AND GOLD IS SO RARE
7065-74598-0034 AS VERY READILY AND WITHOUT THE LEAST OPPOSITION TO TRANSMIT THE MAGNETICK EFFLUVIA AND EASILY TO ADMIT QUICKSILVER INTO ITS PORES AND TO LET WATER PASS THROUGH IT
7065-74598-0035 AND SOLDER'D UP HAS UPON PRESSING THE SPHERE WITH GREAT FORCE LET THE WATER SQUEEZE THROUGH IT AND STAND ALL OVER ITS OUTSIDE IN MULTITUDES OF SMALL DROPS
7065-74598-0036 LIKE DEW WITHOUT BURSTING OR CRACKING THE BODY OF THE GOLD AS I HAVE BEEN INFORM'D BY AN EYE WITNESS FROM ALL WHICH WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT GOLD HAS MORE PORES THAN SOLID PARTS
7065-74598-0037 AND BY CONSEQUENCE THAT WATER HAS ABOVE FORTY TIMES MORE PORES THAN PARTS AND HE THAT SHALL FIND OUT AN HYPOTHESIS BY WHICH WATER MAY BE SO RARE AND YET NOT BE CAPABLE OF COMPRESSION BY FORCE MAY DOUBTLESS BY THE SAME HYPOTHESIS
7065-74598-0038 MAKE GOLD AND WATER AND ALL OTHER BODIES AS MUCH RARER AS HE PLEASES SO THAT LIGHT MAY FIND A READY PASSAGE THROUGH TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCES THE MAGNET ACTS UPON IRON THROUGH ALL DENSE BODIES NOT MAGNETICK NOR RED HOT
7065-74598-0039 WITHOUT ANY DIMINUTION OF ITS VIRTUE AS FOR INSTANCE THROUGH GOLD SILVER LEAD GLASS WATER THE GRAVITATING POWER OF THE SUN IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE VAST BODIES OF THE PLANETS WITHOUT ANY DIMINUTION
7065-74598-0040 WITH THE SAME FORCE AND ACCORDING TO THE SAME LAWS AS IF THE PART UPON WHICH IT ACTS WERE NOT SURROUNDED WITH THE BODY OF THE PLANET THE RAYS OF LIGHT WHETHER THEY BE VERY SMALL BODIES PROJECTED OR ONLY MOTION OR FORCE PROPAGATED
7065-74598-0041 ARE MOVED IN RIGHT LINES AND WHENEVER A RAY OF LIGHT IS BY ANY OBSTACLE TURNED OUT OF ITS RECTILINEAR WAY
7065-74598-0042 AND YET LIGHT IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH PELLUCID SOLID BODIES IN RIGHT LINES TO VERY GREAT DISTANCES HOW BODIES CAN HAVE A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF PORES FOR PRODUCING THESE EFFECTS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE
7065-74598-0043 BUT PERHAPS NOT ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COLOURS OF BODIES ARISE FROM THE MAGNITUDES OF THE PARTICLES WHICH REFLECT THEM AS WAS EXPLAINED ABOVE NOW IF WE CONCEIVE THESE PARTICLES OF BODIES TO BE SO DISPOSED AMONGST THEMSELVES
7065-74598-0044 THAT THE INTERVALS OR EMPTY SPACES BETWEEN THEM MAY BE EQUAL IN MAGNITUDE TO THEM ALL AND THAT THESE PARTICLES MAY BE COMPOSED OF OTHER PARTICLES MUCH SMALLER WHICH HAVE AS MUCH EMPTY SPACE BETWEEN THEM AS EQUALS
7065-74598-0045 ALL THE MAGNITUDES OF THESE SMALLER PARTICLES AND THAT IN LIKE MANNER THESE SMALLER PARTICLES ARE AGAIN COMPOSED OF OTHERS MUCH SMALLER ALL WHICH TOGETHER ARE EQUAL TO ALL THE PORES
7065-74598-0046 OR EMPTY SPACES BETWEEN THEM AND SO ON PERPETUALLY TILL YOU COME TO SOLID PARTICLES SUCH AS HAVE NO PORES OR EMPTY SPACES WITHIN THEM AND IF IN ANY GROSS BODY THERE BE FOR INSTANCE
7065-74598-0047 THREE SUCH DEGREES OF PARTICLES THE LEAST OF WHICH ARE SOLID THIS BODY WILL HAVE SEVEN TIMES MORE PORES THAN SOLID PARTS BUT IF THERE BE FOUR SUCH DEGREES OF PARTICLES THE LEAST OF WHICH ARE SOLID
7065-74598-0048 THE BODY WILL HAVE FIFTEEN TIMES MORE PORES THAN SOLID PARTS IF THERE BE FIVE DEGREES THE BODY WILL HAVE ONE AND THIRTY TIMES MORE PORES THAN SOLID PARTS IF SIX DEGREES
7065-74598-0049 THE BODY WILL HAVE SIXTY AND THREE TIMES MORE PORES THAN SOLID PARTS AND SO ON PERPETUALLY AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF CONCEIVING HOW BODIES MAY BE EXCEEDING POROUS BUT WHAT IS REALLY THEIR INWARD FRAME IS NOT YET KNOWN TO US
7065-74598-0050 BY ONE AND THE SAME POWER VARIOUSLY EXERCISED IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THIS APPEARS BY SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS FIRST BECAUSE WHEN LIGHT GOES OUT OF GLASS INTO AIR AS OBLIQUELY AS IT CAN POSSIBLY DO
7065-74598-0051 IF ITS INCIDENCE BE MADE STILL MORE OBLIQUE IT BECOMES TOTALLY REFLECTED FOR THE POWER OF THE GLASS AFTER IT HAS REFRACTED THE LIGHT AS OBLIQUELY AS IS POSSIBLE IF THE INCIDENCE BE STILL MADE MORE OBLIQUE
7065-74598-0052 BECOMES TOO STRONG TO LET ANY OF ITS RAYS GO THROUGH AND BY CONSEQUENCE CAUSES TOTAL REFLEXIONS SECONDLY BECAUSE LIGHT IS ALTERNATELY REFLECTED AND TRANSMITTED BY THIN PLATES OF GLASS FOR MANY SUCCESSIONS
7065-74598-0053 ACCORDINGLY AS THE THICKNESS OF THE PLATE INCREASES IN AN ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION
