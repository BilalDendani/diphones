2618-138042-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO OF THE REPLY DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS CENSURER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS GRAVE AND DROLL DON QUIXOTE THEN HAVING RISEN TO HIS FEET
2618-138042-0001 TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT LIKE A MAN DOSED WITH MERCURY SAID IN A HURRIED AGITATED VOICE THE PLACE I AM IN THE PRESENCE IN WHICH I STAND AND THE RESPECT I HAVE AND ALWAYS HAVE HAD FOR THE PROFESSION TO WHICH YOUR WORSHIP BELONGS
2618-138042-0002 HOLD AND BIND THE HANDS OF MY JUST INDIGNATION AND AS WELL FOR THESE REASONS AS BECAUSE I KNOW AS EVERYONE KNOWS THAT A GOWNSMAN'S WEAPON IS THE SAME AS A WOMAN'S THE TONGUE I WILL WITH MINE ENGAGE IN EQUAL COMBAT WITH YOUR WORSHIP
2618-138042-0003 FROM WHOM ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED GOOD ADVICE INSTEAD OF FOUL ABUSE PIOUS WELL MEANT REPROOF REQUIRES A DIFFERENT DEMEANOUR AND ARGUMENTS OF ANOTHER SORT AT ANY RATE TO HAVE REPROVED ME IN PUBLIC AND SO ROUGHLY EXCEEDS THE BOUNDS OF PROPER REPROOF
2618-138042-0004 FOR THAT COMES BETTER WITH GENTLENESS THAN WITH RUDENESS AND IT IS NOT SEEMLY TO CALL THE SINNER ROUNDLY BLOCKHEAD AND BOOBY WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING OF THE SIN THAT IS REPROVED COME TELL ME FOR WHICH OF THE STUPIDITIES YOU HAVE OBSERVED IN ME DO YOU CONDEMN AND ABUSE ME
2618-138042-0005 AND BID ME GO HOME AND LOOK AFTER MY HOUSE AND WIFE AND CHILDREN WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER I HAVE ANY IS NOTHING MORE NEEDED THAN TO GET A FOOTING BY HOOK OR BY CROOK IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES TO RULE OVER THE MASTERS
2618-138042-0006 AND THAT PERHAPS AFTER HAVING BEEN BROUGHT UP IN ALL THE STRAITNESS OF SOME SEMINARY AND WITHOUT HAVING EVER SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD THAN MAY LIE WITHIN TWENTY OR THIRTY LEAGUES ROUND TO FIT ONE TO LAY DOWN THE LAW RASHLY FOR CHIVALRY AND PASS JUDGMENT ON KNIGHTS ERRANT
2618-138042-0007 IS IT HAPLY AN IDLE OCCUPATION OR IS THE TIME ILL SPENT THAT IS SPENT IN ROAMING THE WORLD IN QUEST NOT OF ITS ENJOYMENTS BUT OF THOSE ARDUOUS TOILS WHEREBY THE GOOD MOUNT UPWARDS TO THE ABODES OF EVERLASTING LIFE
2618-138042-0008 IF GENTLEMEN GREAT LORDS NOBLES MEN OF HIGH BIRTH WERE TO RATE ME AS A FOOL I SHOULD TAKE IT AS AN IRREPARABLE INSULT BUT I CARE NOT A FARTHING IF CLERKS WHO HAVE NEVER ENTERED UPON OR TROD THE PATHS OF CHIVALRY SHOULD THINK ME FOOLISH KNIGHT I AM AND KNIGHT I WILL DIE
2618-138042-0009 IF SUCH BE THE PLEASURE OF THE MOST HIGH SOME TAKE THE BROAD ROAD OF OVERWEENING AMBITION OTHERS THAT OF MEAN AND SERVILE FLATTERY OTHERS THAT OF DECEITFUL HYPOCRISY AND SOME THAT OF TRUE RELIGION BUT I LED BY MY STAR FOLLOW THE NARROW PATH OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY
2618-138042-0010 AND IN PURSUIT OF THAT CALLING I DESPISE WEALTH BUT NOT HONOUR I HAVE REDRESSED INJURIES RIGHTED WRONGS PUNISHED INSOLENCES VANQUISHED GIANTS AND CRUSHED MONSTERS I AM IN LOVE FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT IT IS INCUMBENT ON KNIGHTS ERRANT TO BE SO
2618-138042-0011 BUT THOUGH I AM I AM NO CARNAL MINDED LOVER BUT ONE OF THE CHASTE PLATONIC SORT MY INTENTIONS ARE ALWAYS DIRECTED TO WORTHY ENDS TO DO GOOD TO ALL AND EVIL TO NONE AND IF HE WHO MEANS THIS DOES THIS AND MAKES THIS HIS PRACTICE DESERVES TO BE CALLED A FOOL
2618-138042-0012 GOOD BY GOD
2618-138042-0013 SAY NO MORE IN YOUR OWN DEFENCE MASTER MINE FOR THERE'S NOTHING MORE IN THE WORLD TO BE SAID THOUGHT OR INSISTED ON AND BESIDES WHEN THIS GENTLEMAN DENIES AS HE HAS
2618-138042-0014 IS IT ANY WONDER IF HE KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT HE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT PERHAPS BROTHER SAID THE ECCLESIASTIC YOU ARE THAT SANCHO PANZA THAT IS MENTIONED TO WHOM YOUR MASTER HAS PROMISED AN ISLAND
2618-138042-0015 AND WHAT'S MORE I AM ONE WHO DESERVES IT AS MUCH AS ANYONE I AM ONE OF THE SORT
2618-138042-0016 AND OF THOSE NOT WITH WHOM THOU ART BRED BUT WITH WHOM THOU ART FED AND OF THOSE WHO LEANS AGAINST A GOOD TREE A GOOD SHADE COVERS HIM I HAVE LEANT UPON A GOOD MASTER AND I HAVE BEEN FOR MONTHS GOING ABOUT WITH HIM AND PLEASE GOD
2618-138042-0017 I SHALL BE JUST SUCH ANOTHER LONG LIFE TO HIM AND LONG LIFE TO ME FOR NEITHER WILL HE BE IN ANY WANT OF EMPIRES TO RULE OR I OF ISLANDS TO GOVERN
2618-138042-0018 FOR IN THE NAME OF SENOR DON QUIXOTE I CONFER UPON YOU THE GOVERNMENT OF ONE OF NO SMALL IMPORTANCE THAT I HAVE AT MY DISPOSAL
2618-138042-0019 SANCHO OBEYED AND ON SEEING THIS THE ECCLESIASTIC STOOD UP FROM TABLE COMPLETELY OUT OF TEMPER EXCLAIMING
2618-138042-0020 NO WONDER THEY ARE MAD WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR SENSES SANCTION THEIR MADNESS I LEAVE YOUR EXCELLENCE WITH THEM FOR SO LONG AS THEY ARE IN THE HOUSE I WILL REMAIN IN MY OWN AND SPARE MYSELF THE TROUBLE OF REPROVING WHAT I CANNOT REMEDY
2618-138042-0021 AND WITHOUT UTTERING ANOTHER WORD OR EATING ANOTHER MORSEL HE WENT OFF THE ENTREATIES OF THE DUKE AND DUCHESS BEING ENTIRELY UNAVAILING TO STOP HIM NOT THAT THE DUKE SAID MUCH TO HIM FOR HE COULD NOT BECAUSE OF THE LAUGHTER HIS UNCALLED FOR ANGER PROVOKED
2618-138042-0022 WHEN HE HAD DONE LAUGHING HE SAID TO DON QUIXOTE
2618-138042-0023 THAT THERE IS NO OCCASION TO SEEK FURTHER SATISFACTION FOR THIS WHICH THOUGH IT MAY LOOK LIKE AN OFFENCE IS NOT SO AT ALL FOR AS WOMEN CAN GIVE NO OFFENCE NO MORE CAN ECCLESIASTICS AS YOU VERY WELL KNOW THAT IS TRUE SAID DON QUIXOTE
2618-138042-0024 AND THE REASON IS THAT HE WHO IS NOT LIABLE TO OFFENCE CANNOT GIVE OFFENCE TO ANYONE WOMEN CHILDREN AND ECCLESIASTICS AS THEY CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES THOUGH THEY MAY RECEIVE OFFENCE CANNOT BE INSULTED BECAUSE BETWEEN THE OFFENCE AND THE INSULT THERE IS AS YOUR EXCELLENCE VERY WELL KNOWS
2618-138042-0025 THIS DIFFERENCE THE INSULT COMES FROM ONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF OFFERING IT AND DOES SO AND MAINTAINS IT THE OFFENCE MAY COME FROM ANY QUARTER WITHOUT CARRYING INSULT TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE A MAN IS STANDING UNSUSPECTINGLY IN THE STREET AND TEN OTHERS COME UP ARMED AND BEAT HIM
2618-138042-0026 HE DRAWS HIS SWORD AND QUITS HIMSELF LIKE A MAN BUT THE NUMBER OF HIS ANTAGONISTS MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO EFFECT HIS PURPOSE AND AVENGE HIMSELF THIS MAN SUFFERS AN OFFENCE BUT NOT AN INSULT ANOTHER EXAMPLE WILL MAKE THE SAME THING PLAIN A MAN IS STANDING WITH HIS BACK TURNED
2618-138042-0027 ANOTHER COMES UP AND STRIKES HIM AND AFTER STRIKING HIM TAKES TO FLIGHT WITHOUT WAITING AN INSTANT AND THE OTHER PURSUES HIM BUT DOES NOT OVERTAKE HIM HE WHO RECEIVED THE BLOW RECEIVED AN OFFENCE BUT NOT AN INSULT BECAUSE AN INSULT MUST BE MAINTAINED IF HE WHO STRUCK HIM
2618-138042-0028 THOUGH HE DID SO SNEAKINGLY AND TREACHEROUSLY HAD DRAWN HIS SWORD AND STOOD AND FACED HIM
2618-138042-0029 OFFENCE BECAUSE HE WAS STRUCK TREACHEROUSLY INSULT BECAUSE HE WHO STRUCK HIM MAINTAINED WHAT HE HAD DONE STANDING HIS GROUND WITHOUT TAKING TO FLIGHT AND SO ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE ACCURSED DUEL I MAY HAVE RECEIVED OFFENCE BUT NOT INSULT
2618-138042-0030 FOR NEITHER WOMEN NOR CHILDREN CAN MAINTAIN IT NOR CAN THEY WOUND NOR HAVE THEY ANY WAY OF STANDING THEIR GROUND AND IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH THOSE CONNECTED WITH RELIGION FOR THESE THREE SORTS OF PERSONS ARE WITHOUT ARMS OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE
2618-138042-0031 AND SO THOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE BOUND TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO OFFEND ANYBODY AND THOUGH I SAID JUST NOW I MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED OFFENCE I SAY NOW CERTAINLY NOT FOR HE WHO CANNOT RECEIVE AN INSULT CAN STILL LESS GIVE ONE
2618-138042-0032 FOR WHICH REASONS I OUGHT NOT TO FEEL NOR DO I FEEL AGGRIEVED AT WHAT THAT GOOD MAN SAID TO ME I ONLY WISH HE HAD STAYED A LITTLE LONGER THAT I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THE MISTAKE HE MAKES IN SUPPOSING AND MAINTAINING THAT THERE ARE NOT AND NEVER HAVE BEEN ANY KNIGHTS ERRANT IN THE WORLD
2618-138042-0033 I WILL TAKE MY OATH OF THAT
2618-138042-0034 THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM A SLASH THAT WOULD HAVE SLIT HIM DOWN FROM TOP TO TOE LIKE A POMEGRANATE OR A RIPE MELON THEY WERE LIKELY FELLOWS TO PUT UP WITH JOKES OF THAT SORT BY MY FAITH
2618-138042-0035 AY LET HIM TACKLE THEM AND HE'LL SEE HOW HE'LL GET OUT OF THEIR HANDS
2618-138042-0036 WAS READY TO DIE WITH LAUGHTER AND IN HER OWN MIND SHE SET HIM DOWN AS DROLLER AND MADDER THAN HIS MASTER AND THERE WERE A GOOD MANY JUST THEN WHO WERE OF THE SAME OPINION DON QUIXOTE FINALLY GREW CALM AND DINNER CAME TO AN END
2618-138042-0037 AND AS THE CLOTH WAS REMOVED FOUR DAMSELS CAME IN ONE OF THEM WITH A SILVER BASIN ANOTHER WITH A JUG ALSO OF SILVER A THIRD WITH TWO FINE WHITE TOWELS ON HER SHOULDER AND THE FOURTH WITH HER ARMS BARED TO THE ELBOWS AND IN HER WHITE HANDS FOR WHITE THEY CERTAINLY WERE
2618-138042-0038 A ROUND BALL OF NAPLES SOAP THE ONE WITH THE BASIN APPROACHED AND WITH ARCH COMPOSURE AND IMPUDENCE THRUST IT UNDER DON QUIXOTE'S CHIN WHO WONDERING AT SUCH A CEREMONY
2618-138042-0039 SAID NEVER A WORD SUPPOSING IT TO BE THE CUSTOM OF THAT COUNTRY TO WASH BEARDS INSTEAD OF HANDS HE THEREFORE STRETCHED HIS OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD AND AT THE SAME INSTANT THE JUG BEGAN TO POUR AND THE DAMSEL WITH THE SOAP RUBBED HIS BEARD BRISKLY RAISING SNOW FLAKES FOR THE SOAP LATHER WAS NO LESS WHITE
2618-138042-0040 AND OVER THE EYES OF THE SUBMISSIVE KNIGHT SO THAT THEY WERE PERFORCE OBLIGED TO KEEP SHUT THE DUKE AND DUCHESS WHO HAD NOT KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT THIS WAITED TO SEE WHAT CAME OF THIS STRANGE WASHING THE BARBER DAMSEL WHEN SHE HAD HIM A HAND'S BREADTH DEEP IN LATHER
2618-138042-0041 PRETENDED THAT THERE WAS NO MORE WATER AND BADE THE ONE WITH THE JUG GO AND FETCH SOME WHILE SENOR DON QUIXOTE WAITED SHE DID SO AND DON QUIXOTE WAS LEFT THE STRANGEST AND MOST LUDICROUS FIGURE THAT COULD BE IMAGINED ALL THOSE PRESENT AND THERE WERE A GOOD MANY
2618-138042-0042 WERE WATCHING HIM AND AS THEY SAW HIM THERE WITH HALF A YARD OF NECK AND THAT UNCOMMONLY BROWN HIS EYES SHUT AND HIS BEARD FULL OF SOAP IT WAS A GREAT WONDER AND ONLY BY GREAT DISCRETION THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO RESTRAIN THEIR LAUGHTER THE DAMSELS THE CONCOCTERS OF THE JOKE
2618-138042-0043 KEPT THEIR EYES DOWN NOT DARING TO LOOK AT THEIR MASTER AND MISTRESS AND AS FOR THEM LAUGHTER AND ANGER STRUGGLED WITHIN THEM AND THEY KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO WHETHER TO PUNISH THE AUDACITY OF THE GIRLS OR TO REWARD THEM FOR THE AMUSEMENT THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM SEEING DON QUIXOTE IN SUCH A PLIGHT
2618-138042-0044 AT LENGTH THE DAMSEL WITH THE JUG RETURNED AND THEY MADE AN END OF WASHING DON QUIXOTE AND THE ONE WHO CARRIED THE TOWELS VERY DELIBERATELY WIPED HIM AND DRIED HIM AND ALL FOUR TOGETHER MAKING HIM A PROFOUND OBEISANCE AND CURTSEY THEY WERE ABOUT TO GO WHEN THE DUKE
2618-138042-0045 LEST DON QUIXOTE SHOULD SEE THROUGH THE JOKE CALLED OUT TO THE ONE WITH THE BASIN SAYING COME AND WASH ME AND TAKE CARE THAT THERE IS WATER ENOUGH THE GIRL SHARP WITTED AND PROMPT CAME AND PLACED THE BASIN FOR THE DUKE AS SHE HAD DONE FOR DON QUIXOTE AND THEY SOON HAD HIM WELL SOAPED AND WASHED
2618-138042-0046 AND HAVING WIPED HIM DRY THEY MADE THEIR OBEISANCE AND RETIRED IT APPEARED AFTERWARDS THAT THE DUKE HAD SWORN THAT IF THEY HAD NOT WASHED HIM AS THEY HAD DON QUIXOTE HE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THEM FOR THEIR IMPUDENCE WHICH THEY ADROITLY ATONED FOR BY SOAPING HIM AS WELL
2618-138042-0047 SANCHO OBSERVED THE CEREMONY OF THE WASHING VERY ATTENTIVELY AND SAID TO HIMSELF GOD BLESS ME
2618-138042-0048 FOR BY GOD AND UPON MY SOUL I WANT IT BADLY AND IF THEY GAVE ME A SCRAPE OF THE RAZOR BESIDES I'D TAKE IT AS A STILL GREATER KINDNESS WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO YOURSELF SANCHO ASKED THE DUCHESS I WAS SAYING SENORA HE REPLIED
2618-138042-0049 DON'T BE UNEASY FRIEND SANCHO SAID THE DUCHESS I WILL TAKE CARE THAT MY DAMSELS WASH YOU AND EVEN PUT YOU IN THE TUB IF NECESSARY
2618-138042-0050 AT ANY RATE FOR THE PRESENT AND AS FOR THE FUTURE GOD HAS DECREED WHAT IS TO BE ATTEND TO WORTHY SANCHO'S REQUEST SENESCHAL SAID THE DUCHESS AND DO EXACTLY WHAT HE WISHES
2618-138042-0051 THE SENESCHAL REPLIED THAT SENOR SANCHO SHOULD BE OBEYED IN EVERYTHING
2618-138042-0052 WHILE THE DUKE AND DUCHESS AND DON QUIXOTE REMAINED AT TABLE DISCUSSING A GREAT VARIETY OF THINGS BUT ALL BEARING ON THE CALLING OF ARMS AND KNIGHT ERRANTRY THE DUCHESS BEGGED DON QUIXOTE AS HE SEEMED TO HAVE A RETENTIVE MEMORY
2618-138042-0053 TO DESCRIBE AND PORTRAY TO HER THE BEAUTY AND FEATURES OF THE LADY DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO FOR JUDGING BY WHAT FAME TRUMPETED ABROAD OF HER BEAUTY SHE FELT SURE SHE MUST BE THE FAIREST CREATURE IN THE WORLD NAY IN ALL LA MANCHA
2618-138042-0054 DON QUIXOTE SIGHED ON HEARING THE DUCHESS'S REQUEST AND SAID IF I COULD PLUCK OUT MY HEART AND LAY IT ON A PLATE ON THIS TABLE HERE BEFORE YOUR HIGHNESS'S EYES IT WOULD SPARE MY TONGUE THE PAIN OF TELLING WHAT CAN HARDLY BE THOUGHT OF FOR IN IT YOUR EXCELLENCE WOULD SEE HER PORTRAYED IN FULL
2618-138042-0055 BUT WHY SHOULD I ATTEMPT TO DEPICT AND DESCRIBE IN DETAIL AND FEATURE BY FEATURE THE BEAUTY OF THE PEERLESS DULCINEA THE BURDEN BEING ONE WORTHY OF OTHER SHOULDERS THAN MINE
2618-138042-0056 AND THE GRAVER OF LYSIPPUS OUGHT TO BE EMPLOYED TO PAINT IT IN PICTURES AND CARVE IT IN MARBLE AND BRONZE AND CICERONIAN AND DEMOSTHENIAN ELOQUENCE TO SOUND ITS PRAISES WHAT DOES DEMOSTHENIAN MEAN SENOR DON QUIXOTE SAID THE DUCHESS
2618-138042-0057 IT IS A WORD I NEVER HEARD IN ALL MY LIFE DEMOSTHENIAN ELOQUENCE SAID DON QUIXOTE MEANS THE ELOQUENCE OF DEMOSTHENES
2618-138042-0058 WHO WERE THE TWO MOST ELOQUENT ORATORS IN THE WORLD TRUE SAID THE DUKE YOU MUST HAVE LOST YOUR WITS TO ASK SUCH A QUESTION NEVERTHELESS SENOR DON QUIXOTE WOULD GREATLY GRATIFY US IF HE WOULD DEPICT HER TO US FOR NEVER FEAR EVEN IN AN OUTLINE OR SKETCH
2618-138042-0059 SHE WILL BE SOMETHING TO MAKE THE FAIREST ENVIOUS I WOULD DO SO CERTAINLY SAID DON QUIXOTE HAD SHE NOT BEEN BLURRED TO MY MIND'S EYE BY THE MISFORTUNE THAT FELL UPON HER A SHORT TIME SINCE ONE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT I AM MORE READY TO WEEP OVER IT THAN TO DESCRIBE IT
2618-138042-0060 FOR YOUR HIGHNESSES MUST KNOW THAT GOING A FEW DAYS BACK TO KISS HER HANDS AND RECEIVE HER BENEDICTION APPROBATION AND PERMISSION FOR THIS THIRD SALLY I FOUND HER ALTOGETHER A DIFFERENT BEING FROM THE ONE I SOUGHT I FOUND HER ENCHANTED AND CHANGED FROM A PRINCESS INTO A PEASANT
2618-138042-0061 FROM FAIR TO FOUL FROM AN ANGEL INTO A DEVIL FROM FRAGRANT TO PESTIFEROUS FROM REFINED TO CLOWNISH FROM A DIGNIFIED LADY INTO A JUMPING TOMBOY AND IN A WORD FROM DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
2618-138042-0062 GOD BLESS ME SAID THE DUKE ALOUD AT THIS WHO CAN HAVE DONE THE WORLD SUCH AN INJURY WHO CAN HAVE ROBBED IT OF THE BEAUTY THAT GLADDENED IT OF THE GRACE AND GAIETY THAT CHARMED IT OF THE MODESTY THAT SHED A LUSTRE UPON IT WHO
2618-138042-0063 REPLIED DON QUIXOTE WHO COULD IT BE BUT SOME MALIGNANT ENCHANTER OF THE MANY THAT PERSECUTE ME OUT OF ENVY
2618-138042-0064 THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE GOOD AND GLORIFY AND EXALT THE DEEDS OF THE WICKED
2618-138042-0065 AND THEY INJURE AND WOUND ME WHERE THEY KNOW I FEEL IT MOST FOR TO DEPRIVE A KNIGHT ERRANT OF HIS LADY IS TO DEPRIVE HIM OF THE EYES HE SEES WITH OF THE SUN THAT GIVES HIM LIGHT OF THE FOOD WHEREBY HE LIVES
2618-138042-0066 AND I SAY IT NOW ONCE MORE A KNIGHT ERRANT WITHOUT A LADY IS LIKE A TREE WITHOUT LEAVES A BUILDING WITHOUT A FOUNDATION OR A SHADOW WITHOUT THE BODY THAT CAUSES IT THERE IS NO DENYING IT SAID THE DUCHESS BUT STILL
2618-138042-0067 IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE THE HISTORY OF DON QUIXOTE THAT HAS COME OUT HERE LATELY WITH GENERAL APPLAUSE IT IS TO BE INFERRED FROM IT IF I MISTAKE NOT THAT YOU NEVER SAW THE LADY DULCINEA AND THAT THE SAID LADY IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD BUT AN IMAGINARY LADY
2618-138042-0068 ONE THAT YOU YOURSELF BEGOT AND GAVE BIRTH TO IN YOUR BRAIN AND ADORNED WITH WHATEVER CHARMS AND PERFECTIONS YOU CHOSE THERE IS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID ON THAT POINT SAID DON QUIXOTE
2618-138042-0069 OR WHETHER SHE IS IMAGINARY OR NOT IMAGINARY THESE ARE THINGS THE PROOF OF WHICH MUST NOT BE PUSHED TO EXTREME LENGTHS I HAVE NOT BEGOTTEN NOR GIVEN BIRTH TO MY LADY THOUGH I BEHOLD HER AS SHE NEEDS MUST BE A LADY WHO CONTAINS IN HERSELF ALL THE QUALITIES TO MAKE HER FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
2618-138042-0070 BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT BLEMISH DIGNIFIED WITHOUT HAUGHTINESS TENDER AND YET MODEST GRACIOUS FROM COURTESY AND COURTEOUS FROM GOOD BREEDING AND LASTLY OF EXALTED LINEAGE BECAUSE BEAUTY SHINES FORTH AND EXCELS WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF PERFECTION UPON GOOD BLOOD
2618-138042-0071 THAN IN THE FAIR OF LOWLY BIRTH THAT IS TRUE SAID THE DUKE BUT SENOR DON QUIXOTE WILL GIVE ME LEAVE TO SAY WHAT I AM CONSTRAINED TO SAY BY THE STORY OF HIS EXPLOITS THAT I HAVE READ FROM WHICH IT IS TO BE INFERRED THAT GRANTING THERE IS A DULCINEA IN EL TOBOSO
2618-138042-0072 OR OUT OF IT AND THAT SHE IS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE BEAUTIFUL AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED HER TO US AS REGARDS THE LOFTINESS OF HER LINEAGE SHE IS NOT ON A PAR WITH THE ORIANAS ALASTRAJAREAS
2618-138042-0073 MADASIMAS OR OTHERS OF THAT SORT WITH WHOM AS YOU WELL KNOW THE HISTORIES ABOUND TO THAT I MAY REPLY SAID DON QUIXOTE THAT DULCINEA IS THE DAUGHTER OF HER OWN WORKS AND THAT VIRTUES RECTIFY BLOOD
2618-138042-0074 AND THAT LOWLY VIRTUE IS MORE TO BE REGARDED AND ESTEEMED THAN EXALTED VICE DULCINEA BESIDES HAS THAT WITHIN HER THAT MAY RAISE HER TO BE A CROWNED AND SCEPTRED QUEEN FOR THE MERIT OF A FAIR AND VIRTUOUS WOMAN IS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING GREATER MIRACLES
2618-138042-0075 AND VIRTUALLY THOUGH NOT FORMALLY SHE HAS IN HERSELF HIGHER FORTUNES I PROTEST SENOR DON QUIXOTE SAID THE DUCHESS
2618-138042-0076 HENCEFORTH I WILL BELIEVE MYSELF AND I WILL TAKE CARE THAT EVERYONE IN MY HOUSE BELIEVES EVEN MY LORD THE DUKE IF NEEDS BE THAT THERE IS A DULCINEA IN EL TOBOSO AND THAT SHE IS LIVING TO DAY
2618-138042-0077 AND THAT SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLY BORN AND DESERVES TO HAVE SUCH A KNIGHT AS SENOR DON QUIXOTE IN HER SERVICE AND THAT IS THE HIGHEST PRAISE THAT IT IS IN MY POWER TO GIVE HER OR THAT I CAN THINK OF BUT I CANNOT HELP ENTERTAINING A DOUBT
2618-138042-0078 THAT THE AFORESAID HISTORY DECLARES THAT THE SAID SANCHO PANZA WHEN HE CARRIED A LETTER ON YOUR WORSHIP'S BEHALF TO THE SAID LADY DULCINEA FOUND HER SIFTING A SACK OF WHEAT AND MORE BY TOKEN IT SAYS IT WAS RED WHEAT A THING WHICH MAKES ME DOUBT THE LOFTINESS OF HER LINEAGE
2618-138042-0079 TO THIS DON QUIXOTE MADE ANSWER SENORA YOUR HIGHNESS MUST KNOW THAT EVERYTHING OR ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ME
2618-138042-0080 WHETHER IT BE THAT IT IS DIRECTED BY THE INSCRUTABLE WILL OF DESTINY OR BY THE MALICE OF SOME JEALOUS ENCHANTER NOW IT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT ALL OR MOST FAMOUS KNIGHTS ERRANT HAVE SOME SPECIAL GIFT ONE THAT OF BEING PROOF AGAINST ENCHANTMENT
2618-138042-0081 ANOTHER THAT OF BEING MADE OF SUCH INVULNERABLE FLESH THAT HE CANNOT BE WOUNDED AS WAS THE FAMOUS ROLAND ONE OF THE TWELVE PEERS OF FRANCE OF WHOM IT IS RELATED THAT HE COULD NOT BE WOUNDED EXCEPT IN THE SOLE OF HIS LEFT FOOT AND THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE POINT OF A STOUT PIN AND NOT WITH ANY OTHER SORT OF WEAPON WHATEVER
2618-138042-0082 AND SO WHEN BERNARDO DEL CARPIO SLEW HIM AT RONCESVALLES FINDING THAT HE COULD NOT WOUND HIM WITH STEEL HE LIFTED HIM UP FROM THE GROUND IN HIS ARMS AND STRANGLED HIM CALLING TO MIND SEASONABLY THE DEATH WHICH HERCULES INFLICTED ON ANTAEUS THE FIERCE GIANT THAT THEY SAY WAS THE SON OF TERRA
2618-138042-0083 I WOULD INFER FROM WHAT I HAVE MENTIONED THAT PERHAPS I MAY HAVE SOME GIFT OF THIS KIND NOT THAT OF BEING INVULNERABLE BECAUSE EXPERIENCE HAS MANY TIMES PROVED TO ME THAT I AM OF TENDER FLESH AND NOT AT ALL IMPENETRABLE NOR THAT OF BEING PROOF AGAINST ENCHANTMENT
2618-138042-0084 FOR I HAVE ALREADY SEEN MYSELF THRUST INTO A CAGE IN WHICH ALL THE WORLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONFINE ME EXCEPT BY FORCE OF ENCHANTMENTS BUT AS I DELIVERED MYSELF FROM THAT ONE I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO OTHER THAT CAN HURT ME AND SO THESE ENCHANTERS
2618-138042-0085 SEEING THAT THEY CANNOT EXERT THEIR VILE CRAFT AGAINST MY PERSON REVENGE THEMSELVES ON WHAT I LOVE MOST AND SEEK TO ROB ME OF LIFE BY MALTREATING THAT OF DULCINEA IN WHOM I LIVE AND THEREFORE I AM CONVINCED THAT WHEN MY SQUIRE CARRIED MY MESSAGE TO HER THEY CHANGED HER INTO A COMMON PEASANT GIRL
2618-138042-0086 ENGAGED IN SUCH A MEAN OCCUPATION AS SIFTING WHEAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID HOWEVER THAT THAT WHEAT WAS NOT RED WHEAT NOR WHEAT AT ALL BUT GRAINS OF ORIENT PEARL
2618-138042-0087 THOUGH SANCHO MY SQUIRE SAW HER IN HER OWN PROPER SHAPE WHICH IS THE FAIREST IN THE WORLD TO ME SHE APPEARED TO BE A COARSE ILL FAVOURED FARM WENCH AND BY NO MEANS A WELL SPOKEN ONE SHE WHO IS PROPRIETY ITSELF
2618-138042-0088 AND SO AS I AM NOT AND SO FAR AS ONE CAN JUDGE CANNOT BE ENCHANTED SHE IT IS THAT IS ENCHANTED THAT IS SMITTEN THAT IS ALTERED CHANGED AND TRANSFORMED IN HER HAVE MY ENEMIES REVENGED THEMSELVES UPON ME
2618-138042-0089 AND FOR HER SHALL I LIVE IN CEASELESS TEARS UNTIL I SEE HER IN HER PRISTINE STATE I HAVE MENTIONED THIS LEST ANYBODY SHOULD MIND WHAT SANCHO SAID ABOUT DULCINEA'S WINNOWING OR SIFTING FOR AS THEY CHANGED HER TO ME IT IS NO WONDER IF THEY CHANGED HER TO HIM
2618-138042-0090 DULCINEA IS ILLUSTRIOUS AND WELL BORN AND OF ONE OF THE GENTLE FAMILIES OF EL TOBOSO WHICH ARE MANY ANCIENT AND GOOD THEREIN MOST ASSUREDLY NOT SMALL IS THE SHARE OF THE PEERLESS DULCINEA THROUGH WHOM HER TOWN WILL BE FAMOUS AND CELEBRATED IN AGES TO COME
2618-138042-0091 AS TROY WAS THROUGH HELEN AND SPAIN THROUGH LA CAVA THOUGH WITH A BETTER TITLE AND TRADITION FOR ANOTHER THING I WOULD HAVE YOUR GRACES UNDERSTAND THAT SANCHO PANZA IS ONE OF THE DROLLEST SQUIRES THAT EVER SERVED KNIGHT ERRANT SOMETIMES THERE IS A SIMPLICITY ABOUT HIM SO ACUTE
2618-138042-0092 THAT IT IS AN AMUSEMENT TO TRY AND MAKE OUT WHETHER HE IS SIMPLE OR SHARP HE HAS MISCHIEVOUS TRICKS THAT STAMP HIM ROGUE AND BLUNDERING WAYS THAT PROVE HIM A BOOBY HE DOUBTS EVERYTHING AND BELIEVES EVERYTHING WHEN I FANCY HE IS ON THE POINT OF COMING DOWN HEADLONG FROM SHEER STUPIDITY
2618-138042-0093 HE COMES OUT WITH SOMETHING SHREWD THAT SENDS HIM UP TO THE SKIES AFTER ALL I WOULD NOT EXCHANGE HIM FOR ANOTHER SQUIRE THOUGH I WERE GIVEN A CITY TO BOOT
2618-138042-0094 THOUGH I PERCEIVE IN HIM A CERTAIN APTITUDE FOR THE WORK OF GOVERNING SO THAT WITH A LITTLE TRIMMING OF HIS UNDERSTANDING HE WOULD MANAGE ANY GOVERNMENT AS EASILY AS THE KING DOES HIS TAXES AND MOREOVER WE KNOW ALREADY AMPLE EXPERIENCE THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE MUCH CLEVERNESS OR MUCH LEARNING TO BE A GOVERNOR
2618-138042-0095 THE MAIN POINT IS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS AND BE DESIROUS OF DOING RIGHT IN ALL THINGS FOR THEY WILL NEVER BE AT A LOSS FOR PERSONS TO ADVISE AND DIRECT THEM IN WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO LIKE THOSE KNIGHT GOVERNORS WHO BEING NO LAWYERS PRONOUNCE SENTENCES WITH THE AID OF AN ASSESSOR
2618-138042-0096 MY ADVICE TO HIM WILL BE TO TAKE NO BRIBE AND SURRENDER NO RIGHT AND I HAVE SOME OTHER LITTLE MATTERS IN RESERVE THAT SHALL BE PRODUCED IN DUE SEASON FOR SANCHO'S BENEFIT AND THE ADVANTAGE OF THE ISLAND HE IS TO GOVERN THE DUKE DUCHESS AND DON QUIXOTE HAD REACHED THIS POINT IN THEIR CONVERSATION
2618-138042-0097 WITH A STRAINING CLOTH BY WAY OF A BIB AND FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL SERVANTS OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING KITCHEN BOYS AND OTHER UNDERLINGS ONE OF WHOM CARRIED A SMALL TROUGH FULL OF WATER THAT FROM ITS COLOUR AND IMPURITY WAS PLAINLY DISHWATER
2618-138042-0098 THE ONE WITH THE TROUGH PURSUED HIM AND FOLLOWED HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT ENDEAVOURING WITH THE UTMOST PERSISTENCE TO THRUST IT UNDER HIS CHIN WHILE ANOTHER KITCHEN BOY SEEMED ANXIOUS TO WASH HIS BEARD WHAT IS ALL THIS BROTHERS ASKED THE DUCHESS WHAT IS IT
2618-138042-0099 DO YOU FORGET HE IS A GOVERNOR ELECT TO WHICH THE BARBER KITCHEN BOY REPLIED THE GENTLEMAN WILL NOT LET HIMSELF BE WASHED AS IS CUSTOMARY AND AS MY LORD AND THE SENOR HIS MASTER HAVE BEEN
2618-138042-0100 THE CUSTOMS OF COUNTRIES AND PRINCES PALACES ARE ONLY GOOD SO LONG AS THEY GIVE NO ANNOYANCE BUT THE WAY OF WASHING THEY HAVE HERE IS WORSE THAN DOING PENANCE I HAVE A CLEAN BEARD
2618-138042-0101 I MEAN TO SAY MY BEARD WITH ALL DUE RESPECT BE IT SAID I'LL GIVE HIM A PUNCH THAT WILL LEAVE MY FIST SUNK IN HIS SKULL
2618-138042-0102 THE DUCHESS WAS READY TO DIE WITH LAUGHTER WHEN SHE SAW SANCHO'S RAGE AND HEARD HIS WORDS BUT IT WAS NO PLEASURE TO DON QUIXOTE TO SEE HIM IN SUCH A SORRY TRIM WITH THE DINGY TOWEL ABOUT HIM AND THE HANGERS ON OF THE KITCHEN ALL ROUND HIM
2618-138042-0103 SO MAKING A LOW BOW TO THE DUKE AND DUCHESS AS IF TO ASK THEIR PERMISSION TO SPEAK
2618-138042-0104 HOLLOA GENTLEMEN YOU LET THAT YOUTH ALONE AND GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM OR ANYWHERE ELSE IF YOU LIKE MY SQUIRE IS AS CLEAN AS ANY OTHER PERSON AND THOSE TROUGHS ARE AS BAD AS NARROW THIN NECKED JARS TO HIM TAKE MY ADVICE AND LEAVE HIM ALONE
2618-138042-0105 FOR NEITHER HE NOR I UNDERSTAND JOKING SANCHO TOOK THE WORD OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND WENT ON NAY LET THEM COME AND TRY THEIR JOKES ON THE COUNTRY BUMPKIN
2618-138042-0106 AS THAT IT'S NOW MIDNIGHT LET THEM BRING ME A COMB HERE OR WHAT THEY PLEASE AND CURRY THIS BEARD OF MINE AND IF THEY GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT THAT OFFENDS AGAINST CLEANLINESS LET THEM CLIP ME TO THE SKIN UPON THIS THE DUCHESS LAUGHING ALL THE WHILE SAID SANCHO PANZA IS RIGHT
2618-138042-0107 AND ALWAYS WILL BE IN ALL HE SAYS HE IS CLEAN AND AS HE SAYS HIMSELF HE DOES NOT REQUIRE TO BE WASHED AND IF OUR WAYS DO NOT PLEASE HIM HE IS FREE TO CHOOSE BESIDES YOU PROMOTERS OF CLEANLINESS HAVE BEEN EXCESSIVELY CARELESS AND THOUGHTLESS
2618-138042-0108 I DON'T KNOW IF I OUGHT NOT TO SAY AUDACIOUS TO BRING TROUGHS AND WOODEN UTENSILS AND KITCHEN DISHCLOUTS INSTEAD OF BASINS AND JUGS OF PURE GOLD AND TOWELS OF HOLLAND TO SUCH A PERSON AND SUCH A BEARD
2618-138042-0109 BUT AFTER ALL YOU ARE ILL CONDITIONED AND ILL BRED AND SPITEFUL AS YOU ARE YOU CANNOT HELP SHOWING THE GRUDGE YOU HAVE AGAINST THE SQUIRES OF KNIGHTS ERRANT THE IMPUDENT SERVITORS AND EVEN THE SENESCHAL WHO CAME WITH THEM TOOK THE DUCHESS TO BE SPEAKING IN EARNEST SO THEY REMOVED THE STRAINING CLOTH FROM SANCHO'S NECK
2618-138042-0110 AND WITH SOMETHING LIKE SHAME AND CONFUSION OF FACE WENT OFF ALL OF THEM AND LEFT HIM WHEREUPON HE SEEING HIMSELF SAFE OUT OF THAT EXTREME DANGER AS IT SEEMED TO HIM RAN AND FELL ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE DUCHESS SAYING FROM GREAT LADIES GREAT FAVOURS MAY BE LOOKED FOR
2618-138042-0111 THIS WHICH YOUR GRACE HAS DONE ME TODAY CANNOT BE REQUITED WITH LESS THAN WISHING I WAS DUBBED A KNIGHT ERRANT TO DEVOTE MYSELF ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE TO THE SERVICE OF SO EXALTED A LADY I AM A LABOURING MAN MY NAME IS SANCHO PANZA I AM MARRIED
2618-138042-0112 I HAVE CHILDREN AND I AM SERVING AS A SQUIRE IF IN ANY ONE OF THESE WAYS I CAN SERVE YOUR HIGHNESS I WILL NOT BE LONGER IN OBEYING THAN YOUR GRACE IN COMMANDING IT IS EASY TO SEE SANCHO REPLIED THE DUCHESS
2618-138042-0113 THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED TO BE POLITE IN THE SCHOOL OF POLITENESS ITSELF I MEAN TO SAY IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN NURSED IN THE BOSOM OF SENOR DON QUIXOTE WHO IS OF COURSE THE CREAM OF GOOD BREEDING AND FLOWER OF CEREMONY OR CIRIMONY AS YOU WOULD SAY YOURSELF
2618-138042-0114 FAIR BE THE FORTUNES OF SUCH A MASTER AND SUCH A SERVANT THE ONE THE CYNOSURE OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY THE OTHER THE STAR OF SQUIRELY FIDELITY
2618-138042-0115 I WILL REPAY YOUR COURTESY BY TAKING CARE THAT MY LORD THE DUKE MAKES GOOD TO YOU THE PROMISED GIFT OF THE GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THIS THE CONVERSATION CAME TO AN END AND DON QUIXOTE RETIRED TO TAKE HIS MIDDAY SLEEP
2618-138042-0116 TO SERVE HER EXCELLENCE HE WOULD TRY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT NOT TO SLEEP EVEN ONE THAT DAY AND THAT HE WOULD COME IN OBEDIENCE TO HER COMMAND AND WITH THAT HE WENT OFF
