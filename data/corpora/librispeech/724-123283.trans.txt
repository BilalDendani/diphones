724-123283-0000 A NEW MARE INTERNUM AT FIRST I COULD HARDLY SEE ANYTHING MY EYES UNACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT QUICKLY CLOSED WHEN I WAS ABLE TO REOPEN THEM
724-123283-0001 AND I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY OTHER DISCOVERER WILL EVER DISPUTE MY CLAIM TO NAME IT AFTER MYSELF AS ITS FIRST DISCOVERER A VAST SHEET OF WATER
724-123283-0002 THE DEEPLY INDENTED SHORE WAS LINED WITH A BREADTH OF FINE SHINING SAND SOFTLY LAPPED BY THE WAVES AND STREWN WITH THE SMALL SHELLS WHICH HAD BEEN INHABITED BY THE FIRST OF CREATED BEINGS
724-123283-0003 ON THIS SLIGHTLY INCLINING SHORE ABOUT A HUNDRED FATHOMS FROM THE LIMIT OF THE WAVES CAME DOWN THE FOOT OF A HUGE WALL OF VAST CLIFFS WHICH ROSE MAJESTICALLY TO AN ENORMOUS HEIGHT
724-123283-0004 SOME OF THESE DIVIDING THE BEACH WITH THEIR SHARP SPURS FORMED CAPES AND PROMONTORIES WORN AWAY BY THE CEASELESS ACTION OF THE SURF FARTHER ON THE EYE DISCERNED THEIR MASSIVE OUTLINE
724-123283-0005 SHARPLY DEFINED AGAINST THE HAZY DISTANT HORIZON IT WAS QUITE AN OCEAN WITH THE IRREGULAR SHORES OF EARTH BUT DESERT AND FRIGHTFULLY WILD IN APPEARANCE
724-123283-0006 IF MY EYES WERE ABLE TO RANGE AFAR OVER THIS GREAT SEA IT WAS BECAUSE A PECULIAR LIGHT BROUGHT TO VIEW EVERY DETAIL OF IT IT WAS NOT THE LIGHT OF THE SUN
724-123283-0007 NOR WAS IT THE PALE AND UNCERTAIN SHIMMER OF THE MOONBEAMS THE DIM REFLECTION OF A NOBLER BODY OF LIGHT NO THE ILLUMINATING POWER OF THIS LIGHT ITS TREMBLING DIFFUSIVENESS ITS BRIGHT CLEAR WHITENESS AND ITS LOW TEMPERATURE
724-123283-0008 SHOWED THAT IT MUST BE OF ELECTRIC ORIGIN IT WAS LIKE AN AURORA BOREALIS A CONTINUOUS COSMICAL PHENOMENON FILLING A CAVERN OF SUFFICIENT EXTENT TO CONTAIN AN OCEAN
724-123283-0009 THE VAULT THAT SPANNED THE SPACE ABOVE THE SKY IF IT COULD BE CALLED SO SEEMED COMPOSED OF VAST PLAINS OF CLOUD SHIFTING AND VARIABLE VAPOURS
724-123283-0010 WHICH BY THEIR CONDENSATION MUST AT CERTAIN TIMES FALL IN TORRENTS OF RAIN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT UNDER SO POWERFUL A PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE THERE COULD BE NO EVAPORATION AND YET UNDER A LAW UNKNOWN TO ME
724-123283-0011 THERE WERE BROAD TRACTS OF VAPOUR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BUT THEN THE WEATHER WAS FINE THE PLAY OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT PRODUCED SINGULAR EFFECTS UPON THE UPPER STRATA OF CLOUD
724-123283-0012 DEEP SHADOWS REPOSED UPON THEIR LOWER WREATHS AND OFTEN BETWEEN TWO SEPARATED FIELDS OF CLOUD THERE GLIDED DOWN A RAY OF UNSPEAKABLE LUSTRE BUT IT WAS NOT SOLAR LIGHT AND THERE WAS NO HEAT
724-123283-0013 SUPREMELY MELANCHOLY INSTEAD OF THE SHINING FIRMAMENT SPANGLED WITH ITS INNUMERABLE STARS SHINING SINGLY OR IN CLUSTERS I FELT THAT
724-123283-0014 BY VAST WALLS OF GRANITE WHICH SEEMED TO OVERPOWER ME WITH THEIR WEIGHT AND THAT ALL THIS SPACE GREAT AS IT WAS WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE MARCH OF THE HUMBLEST OF SATELLITES
724-123283-0015 THEN I REMEMBERED THE THEORY OF AN ENGLISH CAPTAIN WHO LIKENED THE EARTH TO A VAST HOLLOW SPHERE IN THE INTERIOR OF WHICH THE AIR BECAME LUMINOUS BECAUSE OF THE VAST PRESSURE THAT WEIGHED UPON IT WHILE
724-123283-0016 TWO STARS PLUTO AND PROSERPINE ROLLED WITHIN UPON THE CIRCUIT OF THEIR MYSTERIOUS ORBITS
724-123283-0017 SHUT UP INSIDE AN IMMEASURABLE EXCAVATION ITS WIDTH COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED SINCE THE SHORE RAN WIDENING AS FAR AS EYE COULD REACH NOR COULD ITS LENGTH FOR THE DIM HORIZON BOUNDED THE NEW AS FOR ITS HEIGHT IT
724-123283-0018 MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL LEAGUES WHERE THIS VAULT RESTED UPON ITS GRANITE BASE NO EYE COULD TELL BUT THERE WAS A CLOUD HANGING FAR ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF WHICH WE ESTIMATED AT TWELVE THOUSAND FEET
724-123283-0019 A GREATER HEIGHT THAN THAT OF ANY TERRESTRIAL VAPOUR AND NO DOUBT DUE TO THE GREAT DENSITY OF THE AIR THE WORD CAVERN DOES NOT CONVEY ANY IDEA OF THIS IMMENSE SPACE
724-123283-0020 IN COLOMBIA VISITED BY HUMBOLDT HAD NOT GIVEN UP THE WHOLE OF THE SECRET OF ITS DEPTH TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHO INVESTIGATED IT TO THE DEPTH OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET IT PROBABLY DID NOT EXTEND MUCH FARTHER
724-123283-0021 THE IMMENSE MAMMOTH CAVE IN KENTUCKY IS OF GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS
724-123283-0022 OF AN UNFATHOMABLE LAKE AND TRAVELLERS HAVE EXPLORED ITS RAMIFICATIONS TO THE EXTENT OF FORTY MILES BUT WHAT WERE THESE CAVITIES COMPARED TO THAT IN WHICH I STOOD WITH WONDER AND ADMIRATION WITH ITS SKY OF LUMINOUS VAPOURS ITS BURSTS OF ELECTRIC LIGHT
724-123283-0023 AND A VAST SEA FILLING ITS BED MY IMAGINATION FELL POWERLESS BEFORE SUCH IMMENSITY I GAZED UPON THESE WONDERS IN SILENCE WORDS FAILED ME TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
724-123283-0024 HE ASKED YES CERTAINLY AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE DELIGHTFUL WELL TAKE MY ARM AXEL AND LET US FOLLOW THE WINDINGS OF THE SHORE I EAGERLY ACCEPTED AND WE BEGAN TO COAST ALONG THIS NEW SEA
724-123283-0025 ON THE LEFT HUGE PYRAMIDS OF ROCK PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER PRODUCED A PRODIGIOUS TITANIC EFFECT DOWN THEIR SIDES FLOWED NUMBERLESS WATERFALLS WHICH WENT ON THEIR WAY IN BRAWLING BUT PELLUCID STREAMS
724-123283-0026 A FEW LIGHT VAPOURS LEAPING FROM ROCK TO ROCK DENOTED THE PLACE OF HOT SPRINGS AND STREAMS FLOWED SOFTLY DOWN TO THE COMMON BASIN GLIDING DOWN THE GENTLE SLOPES WITH A SOFTER MURMUR
724-123283-0027 WHAT MATTERS REPLIED THE PHILOSOPHER WHETHER THIS OR ANOTHER SERVES TO GUIDE US I THOUGHT HIM RATHER UNGRATEFUL BUT AT THAT MOMENT MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO AN UNEXPECTED SIGHT
724-123283-0028 AT A DISTANCE OF FIVE HUNDRED PACES AT THE TURN OF A HIGH PROMONTORY APPEARED A HIGH TUFTED DENSE FOREST IT WAS COMPOSED OF TREES OF MODERATE HEIGHT FORMED LIKE UMBRELLAS WITH EXACT GEOMETRICAL OUTLINES
724-123283-0029 I COULD NOT GIVE ANY NAME TO THESE SINGULAR CREATIONS WERE THEY SOME OF THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SPECIES OF VEGETABLES KNOWN HITHERTO AND DID THEY CLAIM A PLACE OF THEIR OWN IN THE LACUSTRINE FLORA NO WHEN WE ARRIVED UNDER THEIR SHADE
724-123283-0030 MY SURPRISE TURNED INTO ADMIRATION THERE STOOD BEFORE ME PRODUCTIONS OF EARTH BUT OF GIGANTIC STATURE WHICH MY UNCLE IMMEDIATELY NAMED
724-123283-0031 IT IS ONLY A FOREST OF MUSHROOMS SAID HE AND HE WAS RIGHT IMAGINE THE LARGE DEVELOPMENT ATTAINED BY THESE PLANTS WHICH PREFER A WARM MOIST CLIMATE
724-123283-0032 THOUGH A CHILL FELL UPON ME AS SOON AS I CAME UNDER THOSE CELLULAR VAULTS FOR HALF AN HOUR WE WANDERED FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN THE DAMP SHADES AND IT WAS A COMFORTABLE AND PLEASANT CHANGE TO ARRIVE ONCE MORE UPON THE SEA SHORE
724-123283-0033 BUT THE SUBTERRANEAN VEGETATION WAS NOT CONFINED TO THESE FUNGI FARTHER ON ROSE GROUPS OF TALL TREES OF COLOURLESS FOLIAGE AND EASY TO RECOGNISE THEY WERE LOWLY SHRUBS OF EARTH
724-123283-0034 THE TRANSITION PERIOD THESE HUMBLE GARDEN PLANTS WITH US WERE TALL TREES IN THE EARLY AGES LOOK AXEL AND ADMIRE IT ALL NEVER HAD BOTANIST SUCH A FEAST AS THIS YOU ARE RIGHT MY UNCLE
724-123283-0035 BONES OF EXTINCT ANIMALS I HAD RUSHED UPON THESE REMAINS FORMED OF INDESTRUCTIBLE PHOSPHATES OF LIME AND WITHOUT HESITATION I NAMED THESE MONSTROUS BONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED ABOUT LIKE DECAYED TRUNKS OF TREES
724-123283-0036 WELL AXEL THERE IS A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER TO YOUR OBJECTION THAT THIS SOIL IS ALLUVIAL WHAT
724-123283-0037 ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF ATTRACTION AND GRAVITATION PROBABLY THERE WERE SUBSIDENCES OF THE OUTER CRUST WHEN A PORTION OF THE SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS WAS CARRIED DOWN SUDDEN OPENINGS THAT MAY BE I REPLIED
724-123283-0038 AND AS THIS UNPLEASANT NOTION GOT HOLD OF ME I SURVEYED WITH ANXIOUS SCRUTINY THE OPEN SPACES BEFORE ME BUT NO LIVING CREATURE APPEARED UPON THE BARREN STRAND
724-123283-0039 I FELT RATHER TIRED AND WENT TO SIT DOWN AT THE END OF A PROMONTORY AT THE FOOT OF WHICH THE WAVES CAME AND BEAT THEMSELVES INTO SPRAY THENCE MY EYE COULD SWEEP EVERY PART OF THE BAY
724-123283-0040 WITHIN ITS EXTREMITY A LITTLE HARBOUR WAS FORMED BETWEEN THE PYRAMIDAL CLIFFS WHERE THE STILL WATERS SLEPT UNTOUCHED BY THE BOISTEROUS WINDS A BRIG AND
724-123283-0041 I ALMOST FANCIED I SHOULD PRESENTLY SEE SOME SHIP ISSUE FROM IT FULL SAIL AND TAKE TO THE OPEN SEA UNDER THE SOUTHERN BREEZE BUT THIS ILLUSION LASTED A VERY SHORT TIME
724-123283-0042 I THEN DESIRED TO PIERCE THE DISTANT HAZE AND TO REND ASUNDER THE MYSTERIOUS CURTAIN THAT HUNG ACROSS THE HORIZON ANXIOUS QUERIES AROSE TO MY LIPS WHERE DID THAT SEA TERMINATE WHERE DID IT LEAD TO
