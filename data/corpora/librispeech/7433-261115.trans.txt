7433-261115-0003 FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN US WOULD BE MOCKERY AND ANY CLOSER RELATIONSHIP HAS BECOME IMPOSSIBLE IT HAD COST HIM AN IMMENSE EFFORT TO SAY THESE WORDS AND HE EXPECTED FONDLY EXPECTED
7433-261115-0004 THEN SLIPPED HER HAND DOWN HIS ARM TILL SHE REACHED HIS PALM WHICH SHE PRESSED WITH SUDDEN WARMTH DRAWING HIM INTO THE ROOM AS SHE DID SO AND SHUTTING THE DOOR BEHIND THEM
7433-261115-0005 FOR SHE NEVER HAD LOOKED SO HANDSOME OR SO GLOWING INSTEAD OF SHOWING DEPRESSION OR HUMILIATION EVEN
7433-261115-0006 WITH A SMILE MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANY DISPLAY OF GRIEF FOR IT CONTAINED WHAT IT HAD HITHERTO LACKED POSITIVE AND IRRESISTIBLE ADMIRATION HER WORDS WERE EQUALLY DANGEROUS
7433-261115-0007 I KISS YOUR HAND AS THE SPANIARDS SAY AND SHE ALMOST DID SO

7433-261115-0014 WITH A SUDDEN BURST OF FEELING THAT WAS ALMOST LIKE PRAYER HE RESUMED DO NOT TEMPT ME AMABEL I HAVE TROUBLE ENOUGH WITHOUT LAMENTING THE FAILURE OF MY FIRST STEADFAST PURPOSE

7433-261115-0016 WELL I'M NOT WORTH IT FREDERICK MORE AND MORE ASTOUNDED UNDERSTANDING HER LESS THAN EVER BUT CHARMED BY LOOKS THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED AN ANCHORITE HE TURNED
7433-261115-0017 HIS HEAD AWAY IN A VAIN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE AN INFLUENCE THAT WAS SO RAPIDLY UNDERMINING HIS DETERMINATION SHE SAW THE MOVEMENT RECOGNISED THE WEAKNESS IT BESPOKE
7433-261115-0018 AND IN THE TRIUMPH OF HER HEART ALLOWED A LOW LAUGH
7433-261115-0019 HER VOICE AS I HAVE BEFORE SAID
7433-261115-0020 YOU WILL COME TO SPRINGFIELD SOON SHE AVOWED SLIPPING FROM BEFORE HIM SO AS TO LEAVE THE WAY TO THE DOOR OPEN AMABEL
7433-261115-0021 AND THE INVOLUNTARY OPENING AND SHUTTING OF HIS HANDS REVEALED THE EMOTION UNDER WHICH HE WAS LABOURING
7433-261115-0022 NOW AND THEN BUT ALWAYS AS IF YOU DID NOT MEAN IT
7433-261115-0023 AND THIS TIME AS IF YOU DID MEAN IT WHAT IS THE TRUTH TELL ME WITHOUT COQUETRY OR DISSEMBLING
7433-261115-0024 AND HE PAUSED CHOKED
7433-261115-0025 BUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN THAT SOLEMN OATH THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT SEEMED TO COME BACK WITH THE MOVEMENT FLUSHING WITH A NEW AGITATION HE WHEELED UPON HER SHARPLY NO NO

7433-261115-0034 THE WORD SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM WITH THE FORCE OF A BLOW INNOCENT HE REPEATED INNOCENT BECOMING PALER STILL AS THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER MEANING BROKE GRADUALLY UPON HIM
7433-261115-0035 I FOLLOWED YOU INTO TOWN SHE WHISPERED COMING CLOSER AND BREATHING THE WORDS INTO HIS EAR BUT
7433-261115-0036 HENCEFORTH OUR LIVES ARE ONE MY GOD IT WAS ALL HE SAID BUT IT SEEMED TO CREATE A GULF BETWEEN THEM IN THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED
7433-261115-0037 WHILE UPON HIS FACE AFTER THE FIRST PARALYSING EFFECT OF HER WORDS HAD PASSED
7433-261115-0038 THAT THIS WAS MORE THAN A PASSING IMPULSE
7433-261115-0039 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU SAW ME DO SAID HE BUT WHATEVER IT WAS IT CAN MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN OUR RELATIONS HER WHISPER WHICH HAD BEEN BUT A BREATH BEFORE
7433-261115-0040 I DID NOT PAUSE AT THE GATE YOU ENTERED SAID SHE
7433-261115-0041 A GASP OF IRRESISTIBLE FEELING ESCAPED HIM
7433-261115-0042 SHE WENT ON BUT PREVIOUS TO THAT TIME
7433-261115-0043 AND HUSH HE COMMANDED IN UNCONTROLLABLE PASSION PRESSING HIS HAND WITH IMPULSIVE ENERGY AGAINST HER MOUTH NOT ANOTHER WORD OF THAT OR I SHALL FORGET YOU ARE A WOMAN
7433-261115-0044 OR THAT I HAVE EVER LOVED YOU HER EYES
7433-261115-0045 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME BEGAN TO REGARD HER WITH ANYTHING BUT A LOVER'S EYES I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN SIGHT AT THAT TIME SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE WORLD AT LARGE FEAR
7433-261115-0046 EVEN BY A SMILE BUT SHE WATCHED HIM AS IT SUNK INTO HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WITH AN INTENTNESS
7433-261115-0047 SUDDENLY HER BEARING AND EXPRESSION CHANGED THE FEW REMAINS OF SWEETNESS IN HER FACE VANISHED AND EVEN THE ALLUREMENT WHICH OFTEN LASTS WHEN THE SWEETNESS IS GONE
