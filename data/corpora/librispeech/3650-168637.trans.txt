3650-168637-0000 SOMETIMES HE SPOKE TO HIM THOSE WHO ENVIED THIS MENDICANT SAID THAT HE BELONGED TO THE POLICE HE WAS AN EX BEADLE OF SEVENTY FIVE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY MUMBLING HIS PRAYERS ONE EVENING AS JEAN VALJEAN WAS PASSING BY
3650-168637-0001 WHEN HE HAD NOT COSETTE WITH HIM HE SAW THE BEGGAR IN HIS USUAL PLACE BENEATH THE LANTERN WHICH HAD JUST BEEN LIGHTED THE MAN SEEMED ENGAGED IN PRAYER ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM AND WAS MUCH BENT OVER JEAN VALJEAN STEPPED UP TO HIM
3650-168637-0002 AND PLACED HIS CUSTOMARY ALMS IN HIS HAND THE MENDICANT RAISED HIS EYES SUDDENLY STARED INTENTLY AT JEAN VALJEAN THEN DROPPED HIS HEAD QUICKLY THIS MOVEMENT WAS LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING JEAN VALJEAN WAS SEIZED WITH A SHUDDER
3650-168637-0003 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT BY THE LIGHT OF THE STREET LANTERN NOT OF THE PLACID AND BEAMING VISAGE OF THE OLD BEADLE BUT OF A WELL KNOWN AND STARTLING FACE HE EXPERIENCED THE SAME IMPRESSION THAT ONE WOULD HAVE
3650-168637-0004 ON FINDING ONE'S SELF ALL OF A SUDDEN FACE TO FACE IN THE DARK WITH A TIGER HE RECOILED TERRIFIED PETRIFIED DARING NEITHER TO BREATHE TO SPEAK TO REMAIN NOR TO FLEE STARING AT THE BEGGAR WHO HAD DROPPED HIS HEAD
3650-168637-0005 WHICH WAS ENVELOPED IN A RAG AND NO LONGER APPEARED TO KNOW THAT HE WAS THERE AT THIS STRANGE MOMENT AN INSTINCT POSSIBLY THE MYSTERIOUS INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION RESTRAINED JEAN VALJEAN FROM UTTERING A WORD
3650-168637-0006 THE BEGGAR HAD THE SAME FIGURE THE SAME RAGS THE SAME APPEARANCE AS HE HAD EVERY DAY BAH SAID JEAN VALJEAN I AM MAD I AM DREAMING IMPOSSIBLE AND HE RETURNED PROFOUNDLY TROUBLED
3650-168637-0007 HE HARDLY DARED TO CONFESS EVEN TO HIMSELF THAT THE FACE WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD SEEN
3650-168637-0008 THAT NIGHT ON THINKING THE MATTER OVER HE REGRETTED NOT HAVING QUESTIONED THE MAN IN ORDER TO FORCE HIM TO RAISE HIS HEAD A SECOND TIME ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT NIGHTFALL HE WENT BACK THE BEGGAR WAS AT HIS POST
3650-168637-0009 GOOD DAY MY GOOD MAN SAID JEAN VALJEAN RESOLUTELY HANDING HIM A SOU THE BEGGAR RAISED HIS HEAD AND REPLIED IN A WHINING VOICE THANKS MY GOOD SIR IT WAS UNMISTAKABLY THE EX BEADLE
3650-168637-0010 HOW THE DEUCE COULD I HAVE THOUGHT THAT I SAW JAVERT THERE HE THOUGHT AM I GOING TO LOSE MY EYESIGHT NOW AND HE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING HE WAS IN HIS ROOM
3650-168637-0011 AND ENGAGED IN MAKING COSETTE SPELL ALOUD WHEN HE HEARD THE HOUSE DOOR OPEN AND THEN SHUT AGAIN THIS STRUCK HIM AS SINGULAR
3650-168637-0012 ALWAYS WENT TO BED AT NIGHTFALL SO THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BURN OUT HER CANDLES JEAN VALJEAN MADE A SIGN TO COSETTE TO BE QUIET HE HEARD SOME ONE ASCENDING THE STAIRS
3650-168637-0013 JEAN VALJEAN LISTENED THE STEP WAS HEAVY AND SOUNDED LIKE THAT OF A MAN BUT THE OLD WOMAN WORE STOUT SHOES AND THERE IS NOTHING WHICH SO STRONGLY RESEMBLES THE STEP OF A MAN AS THAT OF AN OLD WOMAN
3650-168637-0014 NEVERTHELESS JEAN VALJEAN BLEW OUT HIS CANDLE HE HAD SENT COSETTE TO BED SAYING TO HER IN A LOW VOICE GET INTO BED VERY SOFTLY AND AS HE KISSED HER BROW THE STEPS PAUSED JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED SILENT
3650-168637-0015 MOTIONLESS WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THE DOOR SEATED ON THE CHAIR FROM WHICH HE HAD NOT STIRRED AND HOLDING HIS BREATH IN THE DARK AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A RATHER LONG INTERVAL HE TURNED ROUND
3650-168637-0016 AS HE HEARD NOTHING MORE AND AS HE RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE DOOR OF HIS CHAMBER HE SAW A LIGHT THROUGH THE KEYHOLE THIS LIGHT FORMED A SORT OF SINISTER STAR IN THE BLACKNESS OF THE DOOR AND THE WALL
3650-168637-0017 SEVERAL MINUTES ELAPSED THUS AND THE LIGHT RETREATED
3650-168637-0018 THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR HAD REMOVED HIS SHOES JEAN VALJEAN THREW HIMSELF ALL DRESSED AS HE WAS ON HIS BED AND COULD NOT CLOSE HIS EYES ALL NIGHT AT DAYBREAK JUST AS HE WAS FALLING INTO A DOZE THROUGH FATIGUE
3650-168637-0019 HE WAS AWAKENED BY THE CREAKING OF A DOOR WHICH OPENED ON SOME ATTIC AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR THEN HE HEARD THE SAME MASCULINE FOOTSTEP WHICH HAD ASCENDED THE STAIRS ON THE PRECEDING EVENING THE STEP WAS APPROACHING HE SPRANG OFF THE BED AND APPLIED HIS EYE TO THE KEYHOLE
3650-168637-0020 WHICH WAS TOLERABLY LARGE HOPING TO SEE THE PERSON WHO HAD MADE HIS WAY BY NIGHT INTO THE HOUSE AND HAD LISTENED AT HIS DOOR AS HE PASSED IT WAS A MAN IN FACT WHO PASSED THIS TIME WITHOUT PAUSING IN FRONT OF JEAN VALJEAN'S CHAMBER
3650-168637-0021 AND JEAN VALJEAN HAD A COMPLETE VIEW OF HIS BACK THE MAN WAS OF LOFTY STATURE CLAD IN A LONG FROCK COAT WITH A CUDGEL UNDER HIS ARM THE FORMIDABLE NECK AND SHOULDERS BELONGED TO JAVERT
3650-168637-0022 JEAN VALJEAN MIGHT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CATCH ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIM THROUGH HIS WINDOW OPENING ON THE BOULEVARD
3650-168637-0023 HE DARED NOT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THIS MAN HAD ENTERED WITH A KEY AND LIKE HIMSELF WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THAT KEY WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THIS
3650-168637-0024 JEAN VALJEAN CAST A PENETRATING GLANCE ON HER BUT HE DID NOT QUESTION HER THE GOOD WOMAN APPEARED AS USUAL AS SHE SWEPT UP SHE REMARKED TO HIM POSSIBLY MONSIEUR MAY HAVE HEARD SOME ONE COME IN LAST NIGHT
3650-168637-0025 AT THAT AGE AND ON THAT BOULEVARD EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WAS THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT THAT IS TRUE BY THE WAY HE REPLIED IN THE MOST NATURAL TONE POSSIBLE WHO WAS IT
3650-168637-0026 I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY DUMONT OR DAUMONT OR SOME NAME OF THAT SORT AND WHO IS THIS MONSIEUR DUMONT THE OLD WOMAN GAZED AT HIM WITH HER LITTLE POLECAT EYES AND ANSWERED
3650-168637-0027 A GENTLEMAN OF PROPERTY LIKE YOURSELF PERHAPS SHE HAD NO ULTERIOR MEANING JEAN VALJEAN THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED ONE WHEN THE OLD WOMAN HAD TAKEN HER DEPARTURE HE DID UP A HUNDRED FRANCS WHICH HE HAD IN A CUPBOARD INTO A ROLL
3650-168637-0028 AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET IN SPITE OF ALL THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH HE TOOK IN THIS OPERATION SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE HEARD RATTLING SILVER A HUNDRED SOU PIECE ESCAPED FROM HIS HANDS AND ROLLED NOISILY ON THE FLOOR
3650-168637-0029 WHEN DARKNESS CAME ON HE DESCENDED AND CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED BOTH SIDES OF THE BOULEVARD HE SAW NO ONE THE BOULEVARD APPEARED TO BE ABSOLUTELY DESERTED IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN CONCEAL HIMSELF BEHIND TREES
