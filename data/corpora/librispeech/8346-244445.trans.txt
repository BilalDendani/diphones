8346-244445-0000 THEY BATHED THEIR FACES FREELY IN THE BROOK AND SAT DOWN ON THE BANK TO REST THE SERGEANT A REGULAR AND A VETERAN OF MANY BORDER CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE INDIANS REGARDED THEM BENEVOLENTLY
8346-244445-0001 AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE CONCERNED IN IT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MY ORDERS I'D HAVE COME FORWARD WITH SOME OF THE MEN SERGEANT SAID SAINT CLAIR IF YOU WERE IN THE WEST AGAIN AND YOU WERE ALL ALONE IN THE HILLS OR ON THE PLAINS
8346-244445-0002 AND A BAND OF YELLING SIOUX OR BLACKFEET WERE TO SET AFTER YOU WITH FELL DESIGNS UPON YOUR SCALP WHAT WOULD YOU DO I'D RUN SIR WITH ALL MY MIGHT I'D RUN FASTER THAN I EVER RAN BEFORE
8346-244445-0003 I'D RUN SO FAST SIR THAT MY FEET WOULDN'T TOUCH THE GROUND MORE THAN ONCE EVERY FORTY YARDS IT WOULD BE THE WISEST THING ONE COULD DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONLY THING IN FACT I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO SERGEANT CARRICK
8346-244445-0004 BECAUSE YOU ARE A MAN OF EXPERIENCE AND MAGNIFICENT SENSE WHAT YOU SAY PROVES THAT HARRY AND I ARE FULL OF WISDOM THEY WEREN'T SIOUX OR BLACKFEET BACK THERE AND I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY'D HAVE SCALPED US BUT THEY WERE YANKEES
8346-244445-0005 AND THEIR INTENTIONS WEREN'T EXACTLY PEACEFUL SO WE TOOK YOUR ADVICE BEFORE YOU GAVE IT IF YOU'LL EXAMINE THE EARTH OUT THERE TOMORROW YOU'LL FIND OUR FOOTPRINTS ONLY FIVE TIMES TO THE MILE FAR TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT OTHER SCATTERING SHOTS HAD BEEN FIRED
8346-244445-0006 WHERE SKIRMISHERS IN THE NIGHT CAME IN TOUCH WITH ONE ANOTHER HENCE THE ADVENTURE OF HARRY AND SAINT CLAIR ATTRACTED BUT LITTLE ATTENTION SHOTS AT LONG RANGE WERE FIRED NEARLY EVERY NIGHT AND SOMETIMES IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE RAW RECRUITS
8346-244445-0007 FROM PULLING TRIGGER MERELY FOR THE PLEASURE OF HEARING THE REPORT BUT WHEN HARRY AND SAINT CLAIR RELATED THE INCIDENT THE NEXT MORNING TO COLONEL TALBOT HE SPOKE WITH GRAVITY THERE ARE MANY YOUNG MEN OF BIRTH AND FAMILY IN OUR ARMY HE SAID
8346-244445-0008 AND THEY MUST LEARN THAT WAR IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS IT IS MORE THAN THAT IT IS A DEADLY BUSINESS THE MOST DEADLY BUSINESS OF ALL IF THE YANKEES HAD CAUGHT YOU TWO IT WOULD HAVE SERVED YOU RIGHT THEY SCARED US BADLY ENOUGH AS IT WAS SIR
8346-244445-0009 SAID SAINT CLAIR COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT SMILED SLIGHTLY THAT PART OF IT AT LEAST WILL DO YOU GOOD HE SAID YOU YOUNG MEN DON'T KNOW WHAT WAR IS AND YOU ARE GROWING FAT AND SAUCY IN A PLEASANT COUNTRY IN JUNE
8346-244445-0010 BUT THERE IS SOMETHING AHEAD THAT WILL TAKE A LITTLE OF THE STARCH OUT OF YOU AND TEACH YOU SENSE NO YOU NEEDN'T LOOK INQUIRINGLY AT ME BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BUT GO GET SOME SLEEP WHICH YOU WILL NEED BADLY
8346-244445-0011 AND BE READY AT FOUR O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE THE INVINCIBLES MARCH THEN AND YOU MARCH WITH THEM HARRY AND SAINT CLAIR SALUTED AND RETIRED
8346-244445-0012 SINCE HE HAD MET HIM AGAIN IN VIRGINIA HARRY HAD RECOGNIZED A DIFFERENCE IN THIS SOUTH CAROLINA COLONEL THE KINDLINESS WAS STILL THERE BUT THERE WAS A NEW STERNNESS ALSO THE FRIEND WAS BEING MERGED INTO THE COMMANDER
8346-244445-0013 THEY CHOSE A TENT IN ORDER TO SHUT OUT THE NOISE AND MAKE SLEEP POSSIBLE BUT ON THEIR WAY TO IT THEY WERE WAYLAID BY LANGDON WHO HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF THEIR ADVENTURE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND WHO FELT CHAGRIN BECAUSE HE HAD LACKED A PART IN IT
8346-244445-0014 ALTHOUGH EVERYTHING GENERALLY HAPPENS FOR THE BEST THERE IS A SLIP SOMETIMES HE SAID
8346-244445-0015 THERE IS A RUMOR THAT THE INVINCIBLES ARE TO MARCH YOU HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE COLONEL AND YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IS IT TRUE IT IS REPLIED HARRY BUT THAT'S ALL WE DO KNOW HE WAS PRETTY SHARP WITH US TOM
8346-244445-0016 AND AMONG OUR THREE SELVES WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANY FAVORS FROM COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL HECTOR SAINT HILAIRE BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS OF THEIRS AND WOULD BE LIKELY TO MEET IN THE SAME DRAWING ROOMS IF THERE WERE NO WAR
8346-244445-0017 HARRY AND SAINT CLAIR SLEPT WELL DESPITE THE NOISES OF A CAMP BUT THEY WERE READY AT THE APPOINTED TIME VERY PRECISE IN THEIR NEW UNIFORMS LANGDON WAS WITH THEM AND THE THREE WERE EAGER FOR THE MOVEMENT
8346-244445-0018 THE INVINCIBLES WERE AN INFANTRY REGIMENT AND THE THREE YOUTHS LIKE THE MEN WERE ON FOOT THEY FILED OFF TO THE LEFT BEHIND THE FRONT LINE OF THE SOUTHERN ARMY AND MARCHED STEADILY WESTWARD
8346-244445-0019 INCLINING SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH MANY OF THE MEN OR RATHER BOYS NOT YET FAST IN THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE BEGAN TO TALK AND GUESS TOGETHER ABOUT THEIR ERRAND BUT COLONEL TALBOT AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
8346-244445-0020 SAINT HILAIRE RODE ALONG THE LINE AND STERNLY COMMANDED SILENCE ONCE OR TWICE MAKING THE MENACE OF THE SWORD THE LADS SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD IT BUT THEY WERE AWED INTO SILENCE
8346-244445-0021 THEN THERE WAS NO NOISE BUT THE RATTLE OF THEIR WEAPONS AND THE STEADY TREAD OF EIGHT HUNDRED MEN THE YOUNG TROOPS HAD BEEN KEPT IN SPLENDID CONDITION DRILLING STEADILY AND THEY MARCHED WELL
8346-244445-0022 THEY PASSED TO THE EXTREME WESTERN END OF THE CONFEDERATE CAMP AND CONTINUED INTO THE HILLS THE SUN HAD PASSED ITS ZENITH WHEN THEY STARTED AND A PLEASANT COOL BREEZE BLEW FROM THE SLOPES OF THE WESTERN MOUNTAINS THE SUN SET LATE
8346-244445-0023 BUT THE TWILIGHT BEGAN TO FALL AT LAST AND THEY SAW ABOUT THEM MANY PLACES SUITABLE FOR A CAMP AND SUPPER BUT COLONEL TALBOT WHO WAS NOW AT THE HEAD OF THE LINE
8346-244445-0024 IF I WERE RIDING A BAY HORSE FIFTEEN HANDS HIGH I COULD GO ON TOO FOREVER WHISPERED LANGDON TO HARRY REMEMBER YOUR BELIEF THAT EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR THE BEST AND JUST KEEP ON MARCHING THE TWILIGHT RETREATED BEFORE THE DARK
8346-244445-0025 BUT THE REGIMENT CONTINUED HARRY SAW A DUSKY COLONEL ON A DUSKY HORSE AT THE HEAD OF THE LINE AND NEARER BY WAS LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAINT HILAIRE ALSO RIDING SILENT AND STERN THE INVINCIBLES WERE WEARY
8346-244445-0026 IT WAS NOW NINE O'CLOCK AND THEY HAD MARCHED MANY HOURS WITHOUT A REST BUT THEY DID NOT DARE TO MURMUR
8346-244445-0027 AND HIS LIEUTENANT COLONEL HECTOR SAINT HILAIRE I WONDER IF THIS IS GOING ON ALL NIGHT WHISPERED LANGDON VERY LIKELY RETURNED HARRY BUT REMEMBER THAT EVERYTHING IS FOR THE BEST LANGDON GAVE HIM A REPROACHFUL LOOK
8346-244445-0028 BUT TRUDGED STURDILY ON THEY HALTED ABOUT AN HOUR LATER BUT ONLY FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES THEY HAD NOW COME INTO MUCH ROUGHER COUNTRY STEEP WITH HIGH HILLS AND POPULATED THINLY
8346-244445-0029 WESTWARD THE MOUNTAINS SEEMED VERY NEAR IN THE CLEAR MOONLIGHT NO EXPLANATION WAS GIVEN TO THE INVINCIBLES BUT THE OFFICERS RODE AMONG THE GROUPS AND MADE A CAREFUL INSPECTION OF ARMS AND EQUIPMENT THEN THE WORD TO MARCH ONCE MORE WAS GIVEN
8346-244445-0030 THEY DID NOT STOP EXCEPT FOR SHORT RESTS UNTIL ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY CAME TO THE CREST OF A HIGH RIDGE COVERED WITH DENSE FOREST BUT WITHOUT UNDERGROWTH THEN THE OFFICERS DISMOUNTED
8346-244445-0031 AND THE WORD WAS PASSED TO THE MEN THAT THEY WOULD REMAIN THERE UNTIL DAWN BUT BEFORE THEY LAY DOWN ON THE GROUND COLONEL TALBOT TOLD THEM WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF THEM WHICH WAS MUCH
8346-244445-0032 IT IS IN A POSITION FROM WHICH THE LEFT FLANK OF OUR MAIN ARMY CAN BE THREATENED OUR ENEMIES THERE ARE FORTIFIED WITH EARTHWORKS AND THEY HAVE CANNON IF THEY HOLD THE PLACE THEY ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE HEAVILY IN NUMBERS
8346-244445-0033 IT IS OUR BUSINESS TO DRIVE THEM OUT THE COLONEL TOLD SOME OF THE OFFICERS WITHIN HARRY'S HEARING THAT THEY COULD ATTACK BEFORE DAWN BUT NIGHT ASSAULTS UNLESS WITH VETERAN TROOPS GENERALLY DEFEATED THEMSELVES THROUGH CONFUSION AND UNCERTAINTY
8346-244445-0034 NEVERTHELESS HE HOPED TO SURPRISE THE NORTHERN SOLDIERS OVER THEIR COFFEE FOR THAT REASON THE MEN WERE COMPELLED TO LIE DOWN IN THEIR BLANKETS IN THE DARK NOT A SINGLE LIGHT WAS PERMITTED
8346-244445-0035 WHICH THEY BROUGHT IN THEIR KNAPSACKS ALTHOUGH IT WAS JUNE THE NIGHT WAS CHILL ON THE HIGH HILLS AND HARRY AND HIS TWO FRIENDS AFTER THEIR DUTIES WERE DONE WRAPPED THEIR BLANKETS CLOSELY AROUND THEMSELVES AS THEY SAT ON THE GROUND
8346-244445-0036 WITH THEIR BACKS AGAINST A BIG TREE THE PHYSICAL RELAXATION AFTER SUCH HARD MARCHING AND THE SHARP WIND OF THE NIGHT MADE HARRY SHIVER DESPITE HIS BLANKET SAINT CLAIR AND LANGDON SHIVERED TOO
8346-244445-0037 THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT PART OF IT WAS THAT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FEELING HARRY SENSITIVE KEENLY ALIVE TO IMPRESSIONS WAS OPPRESSED BY A CERTAIN HEAVY AND UNCANNY FEELING
8346-244445-0038 THEY WERE GOING INTO BATTLE IN THE MORNING AND WITH MEN WHOM HE DID NOT HATE THE ATTACKS ON THE STAR OF THE WEST AND SUMTER HAD BEEN BOMBARDMENTS DISTANT AFFAIRS WHERE HE DID NOT SEE THE FACE OF HIS ENEMY
8346-244445-0039 BUT HERE IT WOULD BE ANOTHER MATTER THE REAL SHOCK OF BATTLE WOULD COME AND THE EYES OF MEN SEEKING TO KILL WOULD LOOK INTO THE EYES OF OTHERS WHO ALSO SOUGHT TO KILL HE AND SAINT CLAIR WERE NOT SLEEPY
8346-244445-0040 AS THEY HAD SLEPT THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY BUT LANGDON WAS ALREADY NODDING MOST OF THE SOLDIERS ALSO HAD FALLEN ASLEEP THROUGH EXHAUSTION AND HARRY SAW THEM IN THE DUSK LYING IN LONG ROWS
8346-244445-0041 THE FAINT MOON THROWING A GHOSTLY LIGHT OVER SO MANY MOTIONLESS FORMS MADE THE WHOLE SCENE WEIRD AND UNREAL TO HARRY HE SHOOK HIMSELF TO CAST OFF THE SPELL AND CLOSING HIS EYES SOUGHT SLEEP
8346-244445-0042 BUT SLEEP WOULD NOT COME AND THE OBSTINATE LIDS LIFTED AGAIN IT HAD TURNED A LITTLE DARKER AND THE MOTIONLESS FORMS AT THE FAR END OF THE LINE WERE HIDDEN
8346-244445-0043 BUT THOSE NEARER WERE SO STILL THAT THEY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PUT THERE TO STAY FOREVER SAINT CLAIR HAD YIELDED AT LAST TO WEARINESS AND WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE TREE SLEPT BY HARRY'S SIDE
8346-244445-0044 HE SAW FOUR FIGURES MOVING UP AND DOWN LIKE GHOSTS THROUGH THE SHADOWS THEY WERE COLONEL TALBOT LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAINT HILAIRE AND TWO CAPTAINS WATCHING THEIR MEN SEEING THAT SILENCE AND CAUTION WERE PRESERVED
8346-244445-0045 HARRY KNEW THAT SENTINELS WERE POSTED FURTHER DOWN THE RIDGE BUT HE COULD NOT SEE THEM FROM WHERE HE LAY ALTHOUGH IT WAS A LONG TIME THE FOREST AND HUMAN FIGURES WAVERED AT LAST AND HE DOZED FOR A WHILE
