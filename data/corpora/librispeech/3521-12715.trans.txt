3521-12715-0000 FOR SIX COMMON SIZED LOAVES OF BREAD TAKE THREE PINTS OF BOILING WATER AND MIX IT WITH FIVE OR SIX QUARTS OF FLOUR WHEN THOROUGHLY MIXED ADD THREE PINTS OF COLD WATER STIR IT TILL THE WHOLE OF THE DOUGH IS OF THE SAME TEMPERATURE
3521-12715-0001 WHEN LUKEWARM STIR IN HALF A PINT OF FAMILY YEAST IF BREWERS YEAST IS USED A LESS QUANTITY WILL ANSWER A TABLE SPOONFUL OF SALT KNEAD IN FLOUR TILL STIFF ENOUGH TO MOULD UP AND FREE FROM LUMPS THE MORE THE BREAD IS KNEADED THE BETTER IT WILL BE
3521-12715-0002 COVER IT OVER WITH A THICK CLOTH AND IF THE WEATHER IS COLD SET IT NEAR A FIRE TO ASCERTAIN WHEN IT HAS RISEN CUT IT THROUGH THE MIDDLE WITH A KNIFE IF FULL OF SMALL HOLES LIKE A SPONGE IT IS SUFFICIENTLY LIGHT FOR BAKING IT SHOULD BE BAKED AS SOON AS LIGHT
3521-12715-0003 IF YOUR BREAD SHOULD GET SOUR BEFORE YOU ARE READY TO BAKE IT DISSOLVE TWO OR MORE TEA SPOONSFUL OF SALERATUS ACCORDING TO THE ACIDITY OF IT IN A TEA CUP OF MILK OR WATER STRAIN IT ON TO THE DOUGH WORK IT IN WELL THEN CUT OFF ENOUGH FOR A LOAF OF BREAD
3521-12715-0004 MOULD IT UP WELL SLASH IT ON BOTH SIDES TO PREVENT ITS CRACKING WHEN BAKED PUT IT IN A BUTTERED TIN PAN THE BREAD SHOULD STAND TEN OR TWELVE MINUTES IN THE PANS BEFORE BAKING IT IF YOU LIKE YOUR BREAD BAKED A GOOD DEAL LET IT STAND IN THE OVEN AN HOUR AND A HALF
3521-12715-0005 WHEN THE WHEAT IS GROWN IT MAKES BETTER BREAD TO WET THE FLOUR ENTIRELY WITH BOILING WATER IT SHOULD REMAIN TILL COOL BEFORE WORKING IN THE YEAST SOME COOKS HAVE AN IDEA THAT IT KILLS THE LIFE OF THE FLOUR TO SCALD IT BUT IT IS A MISTAKEN IDEA
3521-12715-0006 IT IS SWEETER FOR IT AND WILL KEEP GOOD MUCH LONGER BREAD MADE IN THIS WAY IS NEARLY AS GOOD AS THAT WHICH IS WET WITH MILK CARE MUST BE TAKEN NOT TO PUT THE YEAST IN WHEN THE DOUGH IS HOT AS IT WILL SCALD IT AND PREVENTS ITS RISING MOST OVENS REQUIRE HEATING AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR BREAD
3521-12715-0007 A BRISK FIRE SHOULD BE KEPT UP AND THE DOORS OF THE ROOM SHOULD BE KEPT SHUT IF THE WEATHER IS COLD PINE AND ASH MIXED TOGETHER OR BIRCH WOOD IS THE BEST FOR HEATING AN OVEN TO ASCERTAIN IF YOUR OVEN IS OF THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE WHEN CLEANED THROW IN A LITTLE FLOUR
3521-12715-0008 IF IT BROWNS IN THE COURSE OF A MINUTE IT IS SUFFICIENTLY HOT IF IT TURNS BLACK DIRECTLY WAIT SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE PUTTING IN THE THINGS THAT ARE TO BE BAKED IF THE OVEN DOES NOT BAKE WELL SET IN A FURNACE OF LIVE COALS
3521-12715-0009 FOR FOUR LOAVES OF BREAD TAKE THREE QUARTS OF WHEAT FLOUR AND THE SAME QUANTITY OF BOILING WATER MIX THEM WELL TOGETHER
3521-12715-0010 SET IT IN A WARM PLACE TO RISE WHEN LIGHT KNEAD IN FLOUR TILL STIFF ENOUGH TO MOULD UP THEN LET IT STAND TILL RISEN AGAIN BEFORE MOULDING IT UP
3521-12715-0011 WET UP RYE FLOUR WITH LUKEWARM MILK WATER WILL DO TO WET IT WITH BUT IT WILL NOT MAKE THE BREAD SO GOOD PUT IN THE SAME PROPORTION OF YEAST AS FOR WHEAT BREAD FOR FOUR OR FIVE LOAVES OF BREAD PUT IN A COUPLE OF TEA SPOONSFUL OF SALT
3521-12715-0012 A COUPLE OF TABLE SPOONSFUL OF MELTED BUTTER MAKES THE CRUST MORE TENDER IT SHOULD NOT BE KNEADED AS STIFF AS WHEAT BREAD OR IT WILL BE HARD WHEN BAKED WHEN LIGHT TAKE IT OUT INTO PANS WITHOUT MOULDING IT UP LET IT REMAIN IN THEM ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE BAKING
3521-12715-0013 BROWN BREAD IS MADE BY SCALDING INDIAN MEAL AND STIRRING INTO IT WHEN LUKEWARM ABOUT THE SAME QUANTITY OF RYE FLOUR AS INDIAN MEAL ADD YEAST AND SALT IN THE SAME PROPORTION AS FOR OTHER KINDS OF BREAD BAKE IT BETWEEN TWO AND THREE HOURS
3521-12715-0014 WHEN LIGHT TAKE IT OUT INTO BUTTERED PANS LET IT REMAIN A FEW MINUTES THEN BAKE IT TWO HOURS AND A HALF
3521-12715-0015 BOIL THE POTATOES VERY SOFT THEN PEEL AND MASH THEM FINE PUT IN SALT AND VERY LITTLE BUTTER THEN RUB THEM WITH THE FLOUR WET THE FLOUR WITH LUKEWARM WATER THEN WORK IN THE YEAST AND FLOUR TILL STIFF TO MOULD UP
3521-12715-0016 IT WILL RISE QUICKER THAN COMMON WHEAT BREAD AND SHOULD BE BAKED AS SOON AS RISEN AS IT TURNS SOUR VERY SOON THE POTATOES THAT THE BREAD IS MADE OF SHOULD BE MEALY AND MIXED WITH THE FLOUR IN THE PROPORTION OF ONE THIRD OF POTATOES TO TWO THIRDS OF FLOUR
3521-12715-0017 RICE BREAD BOIL A PINT OF RICE TILL SOFT THEN MIX IT WITH A COUPLE OF QUARTS OF RICE OR WHEAT FLOUR WHEN COOL ADD HALF A TEA CUP OF YEAST A LITTLE SALT AND MILK TO RENDER IT OF THE CONSISTENCY OF RYE BREAD WHEN LIGHT BAKE IT IN SMALL BUTTERED PANS
3521-12715-0018 TURN A QUART OF LUKEWARM MILK ON TO A QUART OF FLOUR MELT A COUPLE OF OUNCES OF BUTTER AND PUT TO THE MILK AND FLOUR TOGETHER WITH A COUPLE OF EGGS AND A TEA SPOONFUL OF SALT WHEN COOL STIR IN HALF A TEA CUP OF YEAST AND FLOUR TO MAKE IT STIFF ENOUGH TO MOULD UP
3521-12715-0019 PUT IT IN A WARM PLACE WHEN LIGHT DO IT UP INTO SMALL ROLLS LAY THE ROLLS ON FLAT BUTTERED TINS LET THEM REMAIN TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE BAKING
3521-12715-0020 BOIL A SMALL HANDFUL OF HOPS IN A COUPLE OF QUARTS OF WATER WHEN THE STRENGTH IS OBTAINED FROM THEM STRAIN THE LIQUOR PUT IT BACK ON THE FIRE TAKE A LITTLE OF THE LIQUOR AND MIX SMOOTHLY WITH THREE HEAPING TABLE SPOONSFUL OF WHEAT FLOUR STIR IT INTO THE LIQUOR WHEN IT BOILS
3521-12715-0021 LET IT BOIL FIVE OR SIX MINUTES TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE WHEN LUKEWARM STIR IN A TEA CUP OF YEAST KEEP IT IN A WARM PLACE TILL RISEN WHEN OF A FROTHY APPEARANCE IT IS SUFFICIENTLY LIGHT
3521-12715-0022 ADD A TABLE SPOONFUL OF SALT TURN IT INTO A JAR AND COVER IT TIGHT SOME PEOPLE KEEP YEAST IN BOTTLES BUT THEY ARE APT TO BURST SOME USE JUGS BUT THEY CANNOT BE CLEANED SO EASILY AS JARS
3521-12715-0023 WHENEVER YOUR YEAST GETS SOUR THE JAR SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY CLEANED BEFORE FRESH IS PUT IN IF NOT CLEANED IT WILL SPOIL THE FRESH YEAST YEAST MADE IN THIS MANNER WILL KEEP GOOD A FORTNIGHT IN WARM WEATHER IN COLD WEATHER LONGER
3521-12715-0024 IF IT DOES NOT FOAM WELL WHEN PUT IN IT IS TOO STALE TO USE
3521-12715-0025 TAKE HALF THE QUANTITY OF MILK YOU NEED FOR YOUR BISCUIT SET IT IN A WARM PLACE WITH A LITTLE FLOUR AND A TEA SPOONFUL OF SALT WHEN LIGHT MIX IT WITH THE REST OF THE MILK AND USE IT DIRECTLY FOR THE BISCUIT IT TAKES A PINT OF THIS YEAST FOR FIVE OR SIX LOAVES OF BREAD
3521-12715-0026 ANOTHER METHOD OF MAKING YEAST WHICH IS VERY GOOD IS TO TAKE ABOUT HALF A POUND OF YOUR BREAD DOUGH WHEN RISEN AND ROLL IT OUT THIN AND DRY IT WHEN YOU WISH TO MAKE BREAD PUT A QUART OF LUKEWARM MILK TO IT SET IT NEAR THE FIRE TO RISE
3521-12715-0027 WHEN LIGHT SCALD THE FLOUR AND LET IT BE TILL LUKEWARM THEN ADD THE YEAST AND SALT
3521-12715-0028 THE DOUGH WILL NEED A LITTLE FRESH HOP LIQUOR PUT TO IT IN THE COURSE OF THREE OR FOUR TIMES BAKING POTATO YEAST MAKES VERY NICE BREAD BUT THE YEAST DOES NOT KEEP GOOD AS LONG AS WHEN MADE WITHOUT THEM IT IS MADE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
3521-12715-0029 BOIL A COUPLE OF GOOD SIZED POTATOES SOFT PEEL AND RUB THEM THROUGH A SIEVE PUT TO IT A COUPLE OF TABLE SPOONSFUL OF WHEAT FLOUR AND A QUART OF HOT HOP TEA WHEN LUKEWARM STIR IN HALF A TEA CUP OF YEAST
3521-12715-0030 WHEN LIGHT PUT IN A COUPLE OF TEA SPOONSFUL OF SALT PUT IT IN YOUR YEAST JAR AND COVER IT UP TIGHT
3521-12715-0031 STIR INTO A PINT OF GOOD LIVELY YEAST A TABLE SPOONFUL OF SALT AND RYE OR WHEAT FLOUR TO MAKE A THICK BATTER WHEN RISEN STIR IN INDIAN MEAL TILL OF THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY TO ROLL OUT
3521-12715-0032 WHEN RISEN AGAIN ROLL THEM OUT VERY THIN CUT THEM INTO CAKES WITH A TUMBLER AND DRY THEM IN THE SHADE IN CLEAR WINDY WEATHER CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO KEEP THEM FROM THE SUN OR THEY WILL FERMENT
3521-12715-0033 WHEN PERFECTLY DRY TIE THEM UP IN A BAG AND KEEP THEM IN A COOL DRY PLACE TO RAISE FOUR OR FIVE LOAVES OF BREAD TAKE ONE OF THESE CAKES AND PUT TO IT A LITTLE LUKEWARM MILK OR WATER
3521-12715-0034 BUTTER BISCUIT MELT A TEA CUP OF BUTTER MIX IT WITH TWO THIRDS OF A PINT OF MILK IF YOU HAVE NOT ANY MILK WATER MAY BE SUBSTITUTED BUT THE BISCUIT WILL NOT BE AS NICE PUT IN A TEA SPOONFUL OF SALT HALF A TEA CUP OF YEAST
3521-12715-0035 MILK YEAST IS THE BEST SEE DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING IT STIR IN FLOUR TILL IT IS STIFF ENOUGH TO MOULD UP A COUPLE OF EGGS IMPROVE THE BISCUIT BUT ARE NOT ESSENTIAL
3521-12715-0036 SET THE DOUGH IN A WARM PLACE WHEN RISEN MOULD THE DOUGH WITH THE HAND INTO SMALL CAKES LAY THEM ON FLAT TINS THAT HAVE BEEN BUTTERED LET THEM REMAIN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THEY ARE BAKED
3521-12715-0037 MIX IT WITH A PINT OF BUTTER MILK AND A COUPLE OF TEA SPOONSFUL OF SALT STIR IN FLOUR UNTIL STIFF ENOUGH TO MOULD UP MOULD IT UP INTO SMALL CAKES AND BAKE THEM IMMEDIATELY
3521-12715-0038 WEIGH OUT FOUR POUNDS OF FLOUR AND RUB THREE POUNDS AND A HALF OF IT WITH FOUR OUNCES OF BUTTER FOUR BEATEN EGGS AND A COUPLE OF TEA SPOONSFUL OF SALT MOISTEN IT WITH MILK POUND IT OUT THIN WITH A ROLLING PIN SPRINKLE A LITTLE OF THE RESERVED FLOUR OVER IT LIGHTLY
3521-12715-0039 THIS OPERATION CONTINUE TO REPEAT TILL YOU GET IN ALL THE RESERVED FLOUR THEN ROLL IT OUT THIN CUT IT INTO CAKES WITH A TUMBLER LAY THEM ON FLAT BUTTERED TINS COVER THEM WITH A DAMP CLOTH TO PREVENT THEIR DRYING BAKE THEM IN A QUICK OVEN
3521-12715-0040 MOULD THEM UP INTO SMALL BISCUIT AND BAKE THEM IMMEDIATELY
3521-12715-0041 POTATO BISCUIT BOIL MEALY POTATOES VERY SOFT PEEL AND MASH THEM TO FOUR GOOD SIZED POTATOES PUT A PIECE OF BUTTER OF THE SIZE OF A HEN'S EGG A TEA SPOONFUL OF SALT
3521-12715-0042 IF THE MILK COOLS THE POTATOES PUT IN A QUARTER OF A PINT OF YEAST AND FLOUR TO MAKE THEM OF THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY TO MOULD UP SET THEM IN A WARM PLACE WHEN RISEN MOULD THEM UP WITH THE HAND LET THEM REMAIN TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE BAKING THEM
3521-12715-0043 STIR INTO A PINT OF LUKEWARM MILK HALF A TEA CUP OF MELTED BUTTER A TEA SPOONFUL OF SALT HALF A TEA CUP OF FAMILY OR A TABLE SPOONFUL OF BREWERS YEAST THE LATTER IS THE BEST ADD FLOUR TILL IT IS A VERY STIFF BATTER
3521-12715-0044 WHEN LIGHT DROP THIS MIXTURE BY THE LARGE SPOONFUL ON TO FLAT BUTTERED TINS SEVERAL INCHES APART LET THEM REMAIN A FEW MINUTES BEFORE BAKING BAKE THEM IN A QUICK OVEN TILL THEY ARE A LIGHT BROWN
3521-12715-0045 CRACKERS RUB SIX OUNCES OF BUTTER WITH TWO POUNDS OF FLOUR DISSOLVE A COUPLE OF TEA SPOONSFUL OF SALERATUS IN A WINE GLASS OF MILK AND STRAIN IT ON TO THE FLOUR ADD A TEA SPOONFUL OF SALT AND MILK ENOUGH TO ENABLE YOU TO ROLL IT OUT
3521-12715-0046 BEAT IT WITH A ROLLING PIN FOR HALF AN HOUR POUNDING IT OUT THIN CUT IT INTO CAKES WITH A TUMBLER BAKE THEM ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES THEN TAKE THEM FROM THE OVEN
