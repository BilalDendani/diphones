1092-134562-0000 CHAPTER ONE IT IS WITH A KIND OF FEAR THAT I BEGIN TO WRITE THE HISTORY OF MY LIFE I HAVE AS IT WERE A SUPERSTITIOUS HESITATION IN LIFTING THE VEIL THAT CLINGS ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD LIKE A GOLDEN MIST
1092-134562-0001 THE TASK OF WRITING AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS A DIFFICULT ONE WHEN I TRY TO CLASSIFY MY EARLIEST IMPRESSIONS I FIND THAT FACT AND FANCY LOOK ALIKE ACROSS THE YEARS THAT LINK THE PAST WITH THE PRESENT THE WOMAN PAINTS THE CHILD'S EXPERIENCES IN HER OWN FANTASY
1092-134562-0002 A FEW IMPRESSIONS STAND OUT VIVIDLY FROM THE FIRST YEARS OF MY LIFE BUT THE SHADOWS OF THE PRISON HOUSE ARE ON THE REST BESIDES MANY OF THE JOYS AND SORROWS OF CHILDHOOD HAVE LOST THEIR POIGNANCY
1092-134562-0003 AND MANY INCIDENTS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE IN MY EARLY EDUCATION HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN IN THE EXCITEMENT OF GREAT DISCOVERIES IN ORDER THEREFORE NOT TO BE TEDIOUS I SHALL TRY TO PRESENT IN A SERIES OF SKETCHES
1092-134562-0004 THOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS NO KING WHO HAS NOT HAD A SLAVE AMONG HIS ANCESTORS AND NO SLAVE WHO HAS NOT HAD A KING AMONG HIS MY GRANDFATHER CASPAR KELLER'S SON ENTERED LARGE TRACTS OF LAND IN ALABAMA AND FINALLY SETTLED THERE
1092-134562-0005 TO PURCHASE SUPPLIES FOR THE PLANTATION
1092-134562-0006 WAS A CAPTAIN IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY AND MY MOTHER KATE ADAMS WAS HIS SECOND WIFE AND MANY YEARS YOUNGER HER GRANDFATHER BENJAMIN ADAMS MARRIED SUSANNA E GOODHUE
1092-134562-0007 THEIR SON CHARLES ADAMS WAS BORN IN NEWBURYPORT MASSACHUSETTS AND MOVED TO HELENA ARKANSAS
1092-134562-0008 WHO BELONGED TO THE SAME FAMILY OF EVERETTS AS EDWARD EVERETT AND DOCTOR EDWARD EVERETT HALE AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER THE FAMILY MOVED TO MEMPHIS TENNESSEE I LIVED UP TO THE TIME OF THE ILLNESS THAT DEPRIVED ME OF MY SIGHT AND HEARING
1092-134562-0009 IN A TINY HOUSE CONSISTING OF A LARGE SQUARE ROOM AND A SMALL ONE IN WHICH THE SERVANT SLEPT IT IS A CUSTOM IN THE SOUTH TO BUILD A SMALL HOUSE NEAR THE HOMESTEAD AS AN ANNEX TO BE USED ON OCCASION SUCH A HOUSE MY FATHER BUILT AFTER THE CIVIL WAR
1092-134562-0010 AND WHEN HE MARRIED MY MOTHER THEY WENT TO LIVE IN IT IT WAS COMPLETELY COVERED WITH VINES CLIMBING ROSES AND HONEYSUCKLES FROM THE GARDEN IT LOOKED LIKE AN ARBOUR THE LITTLE PORCH WAS HIDDEN FROM VIEW
1092-134562-0011 IT WAS THE FAVOURITE HAUNT OF HUMMING BIRDS AND BEES THE KELLER HOMESTEAD WHERE THE FAMILY LIVED
1092-134562-0012 BECAUSE THE HOUSE AND THE SURROUNDING TREES AND FENCES WERE COVERED WITH BEAUTIFUL ENGLISH IVY ITS OLD FASHIONED GARDEN WAS THE PARADISE OF MY CHILDHOOD EVEN IN THE DAYS BEFORE MY TEACHER CAME
1092-134562-0013 I USED TO FEEL ALONG THE SQUARE STIFF BOXWOOD HEDGES AND GUIDED BY THE SENSE OF SMELL WOULD FIND THE FIRST VIOLETS AND LILIES THERE TOO
1092-134562-0014 I RECOGNIZED IT BY ITS LEAVES AND BLOSSOMS AND KNEW IT WAS THE VINE WHICH COVERED THE TUMBLE DOWN SUMMER HOUSE AT THE FARTHER END OF THE GARDEN HERE ALSO WERE TRAILING CLEMATIS DROOPING JESSAMINE
1092-134562-0015 AND SOME RARE SWEET FLOWERS CALLED BUTTERFLY LILIES BECAUSE THEIR FRAGILE PETALS RESEMBLE BUTTERFLIES WINGS BUT THE ROSES
1092-134562-0016 NEVER HAVE I FOUND IN THE GREENHOUSES OF THE NORTH SUCH HEART SATISFYING ROSES AS THE CLIMBING ROSES OF MY SOUTHERN HOME THEY USED TO HANG IN LONG FESTOONS FROM OUR PORCH FILLING THE WHOLE AIR WITH THEIR FRAGRANCE
1092-134562-0017 THE BEGINNING OF MY LIFE WAS SIMPLE AND MUCH LIKE EVERY OTHER LITTLE LIFE I CAME I SAW I CONQUERED AS THE FIRST BABY IN THE FAMILY ALWAYS DOES THERE WAS THE USUAL AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION AS TO A NAME FOR ME
1092-134562-0018 THE FIRST BABY IN THE FAMILY WAS NOT TO BE LIGHTLY NAMED EVERY ONE WAS EMPHATIC ABOUT THAT MY FATHER SUGGESTED THE NAME OF MILDRED CAMPBELL AN ANCESTOR WHOM HE HIGHLY ESTEEMED
1092-134562-0019 AND HE DECLINED TO TAKE ANY FURTHER PART IN THE DISCUSSION MY MOTHER SOLVED THE PROBLEM BY GIVING IT AS HER WISH THAT I SHOULD BE CALLED AFTER HER MOTHER WHOSE MAIDEN NAME WAS HELEN EVERETT
1092-134562-0020 BUT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF CARRYING ME TO CHURCH MY FATHER LOST THE NAME ON THE WAY VERY NATURALLY SINCE IT WAS ONE IN WHICH HE HAD DECLINED TO HAVE A PART WHEN THE MINISTER ASKED HIM FOR IT
1092-134562-0021 THAT IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO CALL ME AFTER MY GRANDMOTHER AND HE GAVE HER NAME AS HELEN ADAMS I AM TOLD THAT WHILE I WAS STILL IN LONG DRESSES I SHOWED MANY SIGNS OF AN EAGER SELF ASSERTING DISPOSITION
1092-134562-0022 EVERYTHING THAT I SAW OTHER PEOPLE DO I INSISTED UPON IMITATING AT SIX MONTHS I COULD PIPE OUT HOW D'YE AND ONE DAY I ATTRACTED EVERY ONE'S ATTENTION BY SAYING TEA TEA TEA QUITE PLAINLY
1092-134562-0023 EVEN AFTER MY ILLNESS I REMEMBERED ONE OF THE WORDS I HAD LEARNED IN THESE EARLY MONTHS IT WAS THE WORD WATER AND I CONTINUED TO MAKE SOME SOUND FOR THAT WORD AFTER ALL OTHER SPEECH WAS LOST I CEASED MAKING THE SOUND WAH WAH
1092-134562-0024 ONLY WHEN I LEARNED TO SPELL THE WORD THEY TELL ME I WALKED THE DAY I WAS A YEAR OLD MY MOTHER HAD JUST TAKEN ME OUT OF THE BATH TUB AND WAS HOLDING ME IN HER LAP
1092-134562-0025 I SLIPPED FROM MY MOTHER'S LAP AND ALMOST RAN TOWARD THEM THE IMPULSE GONE I FELL DOWN AND CRIED FOR HER TO TAKE ME UP IN HER ARMS THESE HAPPY DAYS DID NOT LAST LONG ONE BRIEF SPRING
1092-134562-0026 MUSICAL WITH THE SONG OF ROBIN AND MOCKING BIRD ONE SUMMER RICH IN FRUIT AND ROSES ONE AUTUMN OF GOLD AND CRIMSON SPED BY AND LEFT THEIR GIFTS AT THE FEET OF AN EAGER DELIGHTED CHILD THEN IN THE DREARY MONTH OF FEBRUARY
1092-134562-0027 CAME THE ILLNESS WHICH CLOSED MY EYES AND EARS AND PLUNGED ME INTO THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF A NEW BORN BABY THEY CALLED IT ACUTE CONGESTION OF THE STOMACH AND BRAIN THE DOCTOR THOUGHT I COULD NOT LIVE
1092-134562-0028 SEE OR HEAR AGAIN I FANCY I STILL HAVE CONFUSED RECOLLECTIONS OF THAT ILLNESS I ESPECIALLY REMEMBER THE TENDERNESS
1092-134562-0029 WITH WHICH I AWOKE AFTER A TOSSING HALF SLEEP AND TURNED MY EYES SO DRY AND HOT TO THE WALL AWAY FROM THE ONCE LOVED LIGHT WHICH CAME TO ME DIM AND YET MORE DIM EACH DAY
1092-134562-0030 BUT EXCEPT FOR THESE FLEETING MEMORIES IF INDEED THEY BE MEMORIES IT ALL SEEMS VERY UNREAL LIKE A NIGHTMARE GRADUALLY I GOT USED TO THE SILENCE AND DARKNESS THAT SURROUNDED ME
1092-134562-0031 A LUMINOUS SKY TREES AND FLOWERS WHICH THE DARKNESS THAT FOLLOWED
