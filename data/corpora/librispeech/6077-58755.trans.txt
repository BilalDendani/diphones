6077-58755-0000 THE ATMOSPHERE METEOROLOGY IS A SCIENCE THAT AT ONE TIME INCLUDED ASTRONOMY BUT NOW IT IS RESTRICTED TO THE WEATHER SEASONS AND ALL PHENOMENA THAT ARE MANIFESTED IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN ITS RELATION TO HEAT ELECTRICITY AND MOISTURE
6077-58755-0001 AS WELL AS THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE EVER VARYING CONDITIONS OF THE CIRCUMAMBIENT AIR OF OUR GLOBE THE AIR IS MADE UP CHIEFLY OF OXYGEN AND NITROGEN IN THE PROPORTIONS OF ABOUT TWENTY ONE PARTS OF OXYGEN
6077-58755-0002 AND SEVENTY NINE PARTS NITROGEN BY VOLUME AND BY WEIGHT ABOUT TWENTY THREE PARTS OXYGEN AND SEVENTY SEVEN OF NITROGEN THESE GASES EXIST IN THE AIR AS FREE GASES AND NOT CHEMICALLY COMBINED THE AIR
6077-58755-0003 IS SIMPLY A MIXTURE OF THESE TWO GASES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A COMPOUND IN A MIXTURE THERE IS NO CHEMICAL CHANGE IN THE MOLECULES OF THE SUBSTANCES MIXED IN A COMPOUND
6077-58755-0004 NEW MOLECULES ARE FORMED AND A NEW SUBSTANCE IS THE RESULT
6077-58755-0005 AND ONE HALF PER CENT IS CHIEFLY CARBON DIOXIDE CARBON DIOXIDE IS A PRODUCT OF COMBUSTION DECAY AND ANIMAL EXHALATION IT IS POISON TO THE ANIMAL BUT FOOD FOR THE VEGETABLE HOWEVER THE PROPORTION IN THE AIR IS SO SMALL
6077-58755-0006 THAT ITS BANEFUL INFLUENCE UPON ANIMAL LIFE IS REDUCED TO A MINIMUM THE NITROGEN IS AN INERT ODORLESS GAS AND ITS USE IN THE AIR SEEMS TO BE TO DILUTE IT SO THAT MAN AND ANIMALS CAN BREATHE IT IF ALL THE NITROGEN WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE AIR
6077-58755-0007 I SUPPOSE MEN AND ANIMALS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO ORGANIZED THAT THEY COULD BREATHE PURE OXYGEN WITHOUT BEING HURT BUT THEY WERE NOT FOR SOME REASON MADE THAT WAY AIR CONTAINS MORE OR LESS MOISTURE IN THE FORM OF VAPOR
6077-58755-0008 THIS SUBJECT HOWEVER WILL BE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY UNDER THE HEAD OF EVAPORATION THE AIR AT SEA LEVEL WEIGHS FIFTEEN POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH AND IF THE WHOLE ENVELOPE OF AIR WERE HOMOGENEOUS THE SAME IN CHARACTER
6077-58755-0009 IT WOULD REACH ONLY ABOUT FIVE MILES HIGH BUT AS IT BECOMES GRADUALLY RAREFIED AS WE ASCEND IT PROBABLY EXTENDS IN A VERY THIN STATE TO A HEIGHT OF EIGHTY OR NINETY MILES AT LEAST AT THAT HEIGHT
6077-58755-0010 WE SHOULD FIND A MORE PERFECT VACUUM THAN CAN BE PRODUCED BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS THE WEIGHT OF ALL THE AIR ON THE GLOBE
6077-58755-0011 IF NO DEDUCTION HAD TO BE MADE FOR SPACE FILLED BY MOUNTAINS AND LAND ABOVE SEA LEVEL AS IT IS THE WHOLE BULK WEIGHS SOMETHING LESS THAN THE ABOVE FIGURES AS WE HAVE SAID THE AIR ENVELOPES THE GLOBE
6077-58755-0012 TO A HEIGHT AT SEA LEVEL OF EIGHTY OR NINETY MILES GRADUALLY THINNING OUT INTO THE ETHER THAT FILLS ALL INTERSTELLAR SPACE WE LIVE AND MOVE ON THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT OCEAN OF AIR
6077-58755-0013 THE BIRDS FLY IN IT JUST AS THE FISH SWIM IN THE OCEAN OF WATER BOTH ARE TRANSPARENT AND BOTH HAVE WEIGHT WATER IN THE CONDENSED STATE IS HEAVIER THAN THE AIR AND WILL SEEK THE LOWEST PLACES BUT WHEN VAPORIZED
6077-58755-0014 AS IN THE PROCESS OF EVAPORATION IT IS LIGHTER THAN AIR AND FLOATS UPWARD IN THE VAPOR STATE IT IS TRANSPARENT LIKE STEAM IF YOU STUDY A STEAM JET YOU WILL NOTICE THAT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AFTER IT ISSUES FROM THE BOILER
6077-58755-0015 IT IS TRANSPARENT BUT SOON IT CONDENSES INTO CLOUD IF WE COULD SEE INSIDE OF A BOILER IN WHICH STEAM HAD BEEN GENERATED ALL THE SPACE NOT OCCUPIED WITH WATER WOULD SEEM TO BE VACANT SINCE STEAM BEFORE IT IS CONDENSED
6077-58755-0016 SOMETHING MORE IS NEEDED WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL BOTH TO ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE AND THIS ESSENTIAL IS MOTION IF THE AIR REMAINED PERFECTLY STILL WITH NO LATERAL MOVEMENT OR UPWARD AND DOWNWARD CURRENTS OF ANY KIND
6077-58755-0017 WE SHOULD HAVE A PERFECTLY CONSTANT CONDITION OF THINGS SUBJECTED ONLY TO SUCH GRADUAL CHANGES AS THE ADVANCING AND RECEDING SEASONS WOULD PRODUCE OWING TO THE CHANGE IN THE ANGLE OF THE SUN'S RAYS NO CLOUD WOULD EVER FORM
6077-58755-0018 NO RAIN WOULD EVER FALL AND NO WIND WOULD EVER BLOW IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE
6077-58755-0019 BUT THAT COMPARATIVELY SUDDEN CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE TAKE PLACE IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN ORDER THAT VEGETATION AS WELL AS ANIMAL LIFE MAY EXIST UPON THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE THE ONLY PLACE WHERE ANIMAL LIFE COULD EXIST WOULD BE IN THE GREAT BODIES OF WATER
6077-58755-0020 AND IT IS EVEN DOUBTFUL IF WATER COULD REMAIN HABITABLE UNLESS THERE WERE MEANS PROVIDED FOR CONSTANT CIRCULATION MOTION THE MOBILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE IS SUCH THAT THE LEAST INFLUENCE THAT CHANGES ITS BALANCE WILL PUT IT IN MOTION
6077-58755-0021 SO TRUE IS THIS THAT IT IS NEVER SAFE TO PLAN A PICNIC FOR TO MORROW BASED UPON THE PREDICTIONS OF TO DAY THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY OF SOLVING THE GREAT PROBLEMS RELATING TO THE SUDDEN CHANGES IN THE WEATHER AND TEMPERATURE
6077-58755-0022 LIES IN THE FACT THAT TWO THIRDS OR MORE OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE IS COVERED WITH WATER THUS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH STATIONS FOR OBSERVATION THAT WOULD BE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED ALL OVER THE EARTH'S SURFACE
6077-58755-0023 ENOUGH IS KNOWN HOWEVER TO MAKE THE STUDY OF METEOROLOGY A MOST WONDERFULLY INTERESTING SUBJECT
6077-58755-0024 WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF CARBON DIOXIDE SO FAR AS THE LIFE AND HEALTH OF THE ANIMAL IS CONCERNED WE COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT THIS LATTER SUBSTANCE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A NECESSITY IN THE GROWTH OF VEGETATION THERE ARE OTHER THINGS IN THE AIR WHICH
6077-58755-0025 WHILE THEY ARE UNNECESSARY FOR BREATHING PURPOSES IT WILL BE WELL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AS SOME OF THEM ARE THINGS TO BE AVOIDED RATHER THAN INHALED AS BEFORE MENTIONED AIR CONTAINS MOISTURE WHICH IS A VERY VARIABLE QUANTITY
6077-58755-0026 IN A COLD DAY IN WINTER IT IS NOT MORE THAN ONE THOUSANDTH PART WHILE IN A WARM DAY IN SUMMER IT MAY EQUAL ONE FORTIETH OF THE QUANTITY OF AIR IN A GIVEN SPACE THERE IS ALSO A SMALL AMOUNT OF AMMONIA PERHAPS NOT OVER ONE SIXTY MILLIONTH
6077-58755-0027 OXYGEN ALSO EXISTS IN THE AIR IN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES IN ANOTHER FORM CALLED OZONE ONE WAY TO PRODUCE OZONE IS BY PASSING AN ELECTRIC SPARK THROUGH AIR ANYONE WHO HAS OPERATED A HOLTZ MACHINE
6077-58755-0028 HAS NOTICED A PECULIAR SMELL ATTENDING THE DISRUPTIVE DISCHARGES WHICH IS THE ODOR OF OZONE IT IS WHAT CHEMISTS CALL AN ALLOTROPIC FORM OF OXYGEN JUST AS THE DIAMOND GRAPHITE AND CHARCOAL ARE ALL DIFFERENT FORMS OF CARBON
6077-58755-0029 AND YET THE CHEMICAL DIFFERENCES ARE SCARCELY TRACEABLE IT IS MORE STIMULATING TO BREATHE THAN OXYGEN
6077-58755-0030 THE OXYGEN OF THE AIR IS CONSUMED BY ALL PROCESSES OF COMBUSTION AND IN THIS WE INCLUDE THE BREATHING OF MEN AND ANIMALS AND THE DECAY OF VEGETABLE MATTER AS WELL AS THE MORE ACTIVE COMBUSTION ARISING FROM FIRES A GROWN PERSON
6077-58755-0031 CONSUMES SOMETHING OVER FOUR HUNDRED GALLONS OF OXYGEN PER DAY AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ALL THE FIRES ON THE EARTH CONSUME IN A CENTURY AS MUCH OXYGEN AS IS CONTAINED IN THE AIR OVER AN AREA OF SEVENTY MILES SQUARE
6077-58755-0032 ALL OF THESE PROCESSES ARE THROWING INTO THE AIR CARBON DIOXIDE CARBONIC ACID WHICH HOWEVER IS OFFSET BY THE POWER OF VEGETATION TO ABSORB IT WHERE THE CARBON IS RETAINED AND FORMS A PART OF THE WOODY FIBER
6077-58755-0033 AND PURE OXYGEN IS GIVEN BACK INTO THE AIR BY THIS PROCESS THE NORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE AIR ARE MAINTAINED ONE DECIMETER NEARLY FOUR INCHES SQUARE OF GREEN LEAVES WILL DECOMPOSE IN ONE HOUR
6077-58755-0034 SEVEN CUBIC CENTIMETERS OF CARBON DIOXIDE IF THE SUN IS SHINING ON THEM IN THE SHADE THE SAME AREA WILL ABSORB ABOUT THREE IN THE SAME TIME THERE IS ANOTHER SUBSTANCE IN THE FORM OF VEGETABLE GERMS IN THE AIR
6077-58755-0035 CALLED BACTERIA AT ONE TIME THESE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LOW FORMS OF ANIMAL LIFE BUT IT IS NOW DETERMINED THAT THEY ARE THE LOWEST FORMS OF VEGETABLE GERMS BACTERIA IS THE GENERAL OR GENERIC NAME FOR A LARGE CLASS OF GERMS
6077-58755-0036 MANY OF THEM DISEASE GERMS BY ANALYSIS OF THE AIR IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT ON THE OCEAN AND ON THE MOUNTAIN TOPS THESE GERMS AVERAGE ONLY ONE TO EACH CUBIC YARD OF AIR
6077-58755-0037 IN THE STREETS OF THE AVERAGE CITY THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND OF THEM TO THE CUBIC YARD WHILE IN OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE IS SICKNESS AS IN A HOSPITAL WARD THERE MAY BE AS MANY AS EIGHTY THOUSAND TO THE CUBIC YARD
6077-58755-0038 WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE HIGHER ONE'S DWELLING IS LOCATED ABOVE THE COMMON LEVEL THE PURER WILL BE THE AIR THIS RULE HOWEVER HAS ITS LIMITS AS THE OXYGEN OF THE AIR IS HEAVIER THAN THE NITROGEN
6077-58755-0039 SO THAT THE AIR AT VERY GREAT ALTITUDES HAS NOT THE SAME PROPORTION OF OXYGEN TO NITROGEN THAT IT HAS AT A LOWER LEVEL AN ANALYSIS THAT WAS MADE SOME YEARS AGO OF THE AIR ON THE WEST SHORE OF LAKE MICHIGAN ESPECIALLY THAT SECTION WHERE THE BLUFFS ARE HIGH
6077-58755-0040 SHOWS THAT IT COMPARES FAVORABLY WITH THAT OF ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE UNITED STATES IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE TO THE SANITARY CONDITION OF ANY CITY TOWN OR VILLAGE
6077-58755-0041 THAT IT BE NOT TOO COMPACTLY BUILT IF MORE THAN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE OCCUPY A GIVEN AREA IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO PRESERVE
6077-58755-0042 OXYGEN IS THE GREAT PURIFIER OF THE BLOOD AND IF ONE DOES NOT GET ENOUGH OF IT HE SUFFERS EVEN THOUGH HE BREATHES NO IMPURITIES THE POWER TO RESIST THE EFFECTS OF BAD AIR IS MUCH GREATER WHEN ONE IS AWAKE AND ACTIVE THAN WHEN ASLEEP
