3411-187007-0002 AND MUST NOT KNOW WHY CHRIS MIGHT BE SURPRISED AT CERTAIN PLACES GEORGETOWN IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN NINETY MIGHT BE NEW FOR AMOS BUT NOT NEARLY AS NEW AS IT WOULD BE FOR CHRIS
3411-187007-0003 CHRIS HAD LONG AGO DECIDED
3411-187007-0004 WHILE LOOKING ABOUT HIM CHRIS GLANCED MORE THAN ONCE AT AMOS

3411-187007-0007 FOR SOME TIME CHRIS AND AMOS STOOD WATCHING THE MEN CARRYING OUT BALES OR KEGS ON THEIR SHOULDERS WHEN ONE PART OF THE CARGO HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED ON THE DOCK AN AUCTION WAS HELD FORTHWITH TO SELL IT OFF AT ONCE TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER

3411-187007-0012 FROWNING WITH DISAPPROVAL THAT OUR BRICKS FOR BUILDING HOUSES HAVE ALL COME FROM BRITISH KILNS NO SIR THANK YOU SIR
3411-187007-0013 NOT IN THE LEAST ABASHED HOW I SHOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE TOLD HIM I DIDN'T BELONG IN THIS AGE ANYWAY AND THAT IN MY TIME WE DO MAKE OUR OWN BRICKS HE CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF FURTHER ON A SHIP BEING PAINTED A DAZZLING WHITE CAUGHT THEIR EYES THE
3411-187007-0014 RUNNING FORWARD AND SURE ENOUGH BLACK AND GOLD LETTERS ALONG HER BOW PRONOUNCED THAT INDEED IT WAS THE MIRABELLE I'D KNOW THOSE LINES ANYWHERE CHRIS SAID TO AMOS AND THE TWO BOYS STOOD GAZING AT MISTER WICKER'S SHIP
3411-187007-0015 THE MIRABELLE WAS A THREE MASTED SCHOONER OF MORE THAN USUALLY TRIM LINES
3411-187007-0016 AT THE WATERLINE A CLEAR LIGHT GREEN CONTRASTED WELL WITH THE WHITE OF HER SIDES ABOVE DECKS THE SIZE OF THE MASTS AND NEATLY FURLED SAILS SHOWED AT A GLANCE THAT THE MIRABELLE WAS HARDY ENOUGH
3411-187007-0017 LOOKING ABOUT CHRIS SOON SPIED NED CILLEY ON DECK LOUNGING AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE SHIP AND SMOKING HIS PIPE MASTER CILLEY'S EYES LIT UP AS HE SAW HIS FRIENDS
3411-187007-0018 AS IF HE HAD NOT SEEN THEM FOR A MONTH INSTEAD OF JUST THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN HE HAD SHARED WITH THEM WHAT BECKY TERMED A TASTE
3411-187007-0019 NED CILLEY BEAMED ON THEM AND LEANED BACK ON HIS HEELS FOR A BETTER VIEW
3411-187007-0020 THE BOYS WERE AGREEING ENTHUSIASTICALLY WHEN A REMARKABLE COUPLE CAME INTO SIGHT PACING THE DECKS OF THE MIRABELLE SOON THE WATCHERS WERE GIVEN A BETTER LOOK FOR THE TWO MEN CAME DOWN THE GANGPLANK TO EXAMINE CASES THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO THE DOCK FOR LOADING
3411-187007-0021 AND CHRIS AND AMOS WERE HARD PUT TO IT NOT TO LAUGH OUT LOUD AT THE COMICAL PAIR THE FIRST MAN WAS SO ROUND AND SO SHORT HE APPEARED TO HAVE NO LEGS AT ALL
3411-187007-0022 BELOW A TIGHT ROUND PAUNCH TWO SMALL FEET LOOKING RATHER LIKE MICE WENT IN AND OUT AS HE WALKED THE ROUNDNESS OF HIS FACE WAS UNDERLINED BY THREE FOLDS OF CHIN
3411-187007-0023 THAT MADE CHRIS FEEL THE MAN WAS NO FOOL HE CONSTANTLY BURBLED WITH LAUGHTER AND WAS IN A HIGH GOOD HUMOR OCCASIONAL REMARKS FROM HIS COMPANION CAUSING HIM NOW AND AGAIN TO CHUCKLE WITH AMUSEMENT
3411-187007-0024 WHAT THE OTHER MAN COULD BE SAYING THAT WAS SO ENTERTAINING CHRIS COULD NOT IMAGINE FOR HE WAS THE OPPOSITE OF THE FAT GOOD HUMORED ONE THIS SECOND PERSON WAS TWICE AGAIN AS TALL AS THE PLUMP LITTLE FELLOW BESIDE HIM
3411-187007-0025 AND WAS AS DOUR AND THIN AS THE OTHER WAS CHEERY AND FAT HE SEEMED IN A STATE OF PERPETUAL DEPRESSION AND NO AMOUNT OF CHUCKLES ON THE PART OF THE PLUMP GENTLEMAN
3411-187007-0026 CILLEY LOOKED SCANDALIZED AT CHRIS'S IMPERTINENCE IN FINDING THEM IN ANY WAY DROLL THEM
3411-187007-0027 HE IS AND MISTER ELISHA FINNEY NED CILLEY TOLD THEM
3411-187007-0028 LOWERING HIS VOICE AND BENDING DOWN TO BE ON A LEVEL WITH CHRIS AND AMOS BUT BELIEVE ME THERE'S NO SOUNDER CAPTAIN AFLOAT THEY ALL KNOW IT HEREABOUTS FOR EZEKIAL BLIZZARD KNOWS THE CHINY SEAS BETTER THAN THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN FEET

3411-187007-0033 HE INVITED AND TAKING CHRIS AND AMOS'S ARMS DREW THEM TOWARDS A GROUP OF SEAMEN CHRIS LOOKED QUICKLY AROUND AT THE FACES OF THE MEN FOR THESE HE SECRETLY KNEW WERE TO BE HIS COMPANIONS ON A LONG SEA JOURNEY SOON TO START
3411-187007-0034 WITH A DEEP SENSE OF RELIEF HE FOUND THAT HE LIKED THEM ALL ALL PERHAPS BUT ONE
3411-187007-0035 NOW BOYS HE ROARED THIS GOOD MAN HERE IS BOWIE A SHORT MUSCULAR BOWLEGGED MAN WITH A FRIENDLY GRIN NODDED HIS HEAD AT THEM AND CUT OFF A PIECE OF BLACK TOBACCO WITH HIS KNIFE STUFFING IT INTO HIS MOUTH KNIFE BLADE AND ALL

3411-187007-0037 BUT WHEN THEY HAD REACHED ZACHARY A TALL YOUNG MAN OF EIGHTEEN YEARS OR SO ZACHARY BENT HIS HANDSOME SURLY FACE AND FUMBLED AT HIS SHOE CHRIS STOOD THERE WITH HIS HAND OUT FEELING THE RED BLOOD SURGING ANGRILY UP HIS CHEEKS
3411-187007-0038 AND THEN HE WONDERED WHO ZACHARY WAS LOOKING AT FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE CHRIS TURNED HIS HEAD AND DID NOT HAVE TO HEAR THE NAME MUTTERED BY CILLEY OR BY BOWIE AT HIS BACK
