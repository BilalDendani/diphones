2288-155711-0000 IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO PRESENT THE ACCOMPLISHED LADY WHO WAS OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE IN THE SUITE OF THE DORRIT FAMILY TO HAVE A LINE TO HERSELF IN THE TRAVELLERS BOOK MISSUS GENERAL WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A CLERICAL DIGNITARY IN A CATHEDRAL TOWN
2288-155711-0001 WHERE SHE HAD LED THE FASHION UNTIL SHE WAS AS NEAR FORTY FIVE AS A SINGLE LADY CAN BE A STIFF COMMISSARIAT OFFICER OF SIXTY FAMOUS AS A MARTINET
2288-155711-0002 AND HAD SOLICITED TO BE TAKEN BESIDE HER ON THE BOX OF THE COOL COACH OF CEREMONY TO WHICH THAT TEAM WAS HARNESSED HIS PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE BEING ACCEPTED BY THE LADY THE COMMISSARY TOOK HIS SEAT BEHIND THE PROPRIETIES WITH GREAT DECORUM
2288-155711-0003 AND MISSUS GENERAL DROVE UNTIL THE COMMISSARY DIED IN THE COURSE OF THEIR UNITED JOURNEY THEY RAN OVER SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO CAME IN THE WAY OF THE PROPRIETIES BUT ALWAYS IN A HIGH STYLE AND WITH COMPOSURE
2288-155711-0004 AND THEY ALL HAD FEATHERS AND BLACK VELVET HOUSINGS WITH HIS COAT OF ARMS IN THE CORNER MISSUS GENERAL BEGAN TO INQUIRE WHAT QUANTITY OF DUST AND ASHES WAS DEPOSITED AT THE BANKERS
2288-155711-0005 BUT FOR THE PERFECT REGULATION OF HER MIND SHE MIGHT HAVE FELT DISPOSED TO QUESTION THE ACCURACY OF THAT PORTION OF THE LATE SERVICE WHICH HAD DECLARED THAT THE COMMISSARY COULD TAKE NOTHING AWAY WITH HIM
2288-155711-0006 IN THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IT OCCURRED TO MISSUS GENERAL THAT SHE MIGHT FORM THE MIND AND EKE THE MANNERS OF SOME YOUNG LADY OF DISTINCTION OR THAT SHE MIGHT HARNESS THE PROPRIETIES TO THE CARRIAGE OF SOME RICH YOUNG HEIRESS OR WIDOW
2288-155711-0007 AND BECOME AT ONCE THE DRIVER AND GUARD OF SUCH VEHICLE THROUGH THE SOCIAL MAZES MISSUS GENERAL'S COMMUNICATION OF THIS IDEA TO HER CLERICAL AND COMMISSARIAT CONNECTION WAS SO WARMLY APPLAUDED THAT BUT FOR THE LADY'S UNDOUBTED MERIT
2288-155711-0008 IT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS THOUGH THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF HER TESTIMONIALS REPRESENTING MISSUS GENERAL AS A PRODIGY OF PIETY LEARNING VIRTUE AND GENTILITY WERE LAVISHLY CONTRIBUTED FROM INFLUENTIAL QUARTERS
2288-155711-0009 THUS DELEGATED ON HER MISSION AS IT WERE BY CHURCH AND STATE
2288-155711-0010 OPENED NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE LADY AND AS IT WAS A PART EITHER OF THE NATIVE DIGNITY OR OF THE ARTIFICIAL POLICY OF MISSUS GENERAL BUT CERTAINLY ONE OR THE OTHER TO COMPORT HERSELF AS IF SHE WERE MUCH MORE SOUGHT THAN SEEKING
2288-155711-0011 THE WIDOWER PURSUED MISSUS GENERAL UNTIL HE PREVAILED UPON HER TO FORM HIS DAUGHTER'S MIND
2288-155711-0012 THE EXECUTION OF THIS TRUST OCCUPIED MISSUS GENERAL ABOUT SEVEN YEARS IN THE COURSE OF WHICH TIME SHE MADE THE TOUR OF EUROPE AND SAW MOST OF THAT EXTENSIVE MISCELLANY OF OBJECTS WHICH IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL PERSONS OF POLITE CULTIVATION SHOULD SEE
2288-155711-0013 WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S EYES AND NEVER WITH THEIR OWN WHEN HER CHARGE WAS AT LENGTH FORMED THE MARRIAGE NOT ONLY OF THE YOUNG LADY BUT LIKEWISE OF HER FATHER THE WIDOWER WAS RESOLVED ON
2288-155711-0014 IN ALL QUARTERS WHERE HE THOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ARISE OF TRANSFERRING THE BLESSING TO SOMEBODY ELSE THAT MISSUS GENERAL WAS A NAME MORE HONOURABLE THAN EVER THE PHOENIX WAS TO LET ON THIS ELEVATED PERCH
2288-155711-0015 WHEN MISTER DORRIT WHO HAD LATELY SUCCEEDED TO HIS PROPERTY MENTIONED TO HIS BANKERS THAT HE WISHED TO DISCOVER A LADY WELL BRED ACCOMPLISHED WELL CONNECTED WELL ACCUSTOMED TO GOOD SOCIETY WHO WAS QUALIFIED AT ONCE TO COMPLETE THE EDUCATION OF HIS DAUGHTERS
2288-155711-0016 PURSUING THE LIGHT SO FORTUNATELY HIT UPON AND FINDING THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY OF THE WHOLE OF MISSUS GENERAL'S ACQUAINTANCE TO BE OF THE PATHETIC NATURE ALREADY RECORDED MISTER DORRIT TOOK THE TROUBLE OF GOING DOWN TO THE COUNTY OF THE COUNTY WIDOWER
2288-155711-0017 TO SEE MISSUS GENERAL IN WHOM HE FOUND A LADY OF A QUALITY SUPERIOR TO HIS HIGHEST EXPECTATIONS MIGHT I BE EXCUSED SAID MISTER DORRIT
2288-155711-0018 WHY INDEED RETURNED MISSUS GENERAL STOPPING THE WORD IT IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH I PREFER TO AVOID ENTERING I HAVE NEVER ENTERED ON IT WITH MY FRIENDS HERE AND I CANNOT OVERCOME THE DELICACY MISTER DORRIT
2288-155711-0019 WITH WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED IT I AM NOT AS I HOPE YOU ARE AWARE A GOVERNESS O DEAR NO SAID MISTER DORRIT PRAY MADAM DO NOT IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT I THINK SO
2288-155711-0020 HE REALLY BLUSHED TO BE SUSPECTED OF IT MISSUS GENERAL GRAVELY INCLINED HER HEAD I CANNOT THEREFORE PUT A PRICE UPON SERVICES WHICH IT IS A PLEASURE TO ME TO RENDER IF I CAN RENDER THEM SPONTANEOUSLY
2288-155711-0021 BUT WHICH I COULD NOT RENDER IN MERE RETURN FOR ANY CONSIDERATION NEITHER DO I KNOW HOW OR WHERE TO FIND A CASE PARALLEL TO MY OWN IT IS PECULIAR NO DOUBT BUT HOW THEN
2288-155711-0022 MISTER DORRIT NOT UNNATURALLY HINTED COULD THE SUBJECT BE APPROACHED I CANNOT OBJECT SAID MISSUS GENERAL
2288-155711-0023 TO MISTER DORRIT'S INQUIRING IN CONFIDENCE OF MY FRIENDS HERE WHAT AMOUNT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED AT QUARTERLY INTERVALS TO PAY TO MY CREDIT AT MY BANKERS MISTER DORRIT BOWED HIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS PERMIT ME TO ADD
2288-155711-0024 SAID MISSUS GENERAL THAT BEYOND THIS I CAN NEVER RESUME THE TOPIC ALSO THAT I CAN ACCEPT NO SECOND OR INFERIOR POSITION
2288-155711-0025 I THINK TWO DAUGHTERS WERE MENTIONED TWO DAUGHTERS I COULD ONLY ACCEPT IT ON TERMS OF PERFECT EQUALITY AS A COMPANION PROTECTOR MENTOR AND FRIEND
2288-155711-0026 TWO DAUGHTERS WERE MENTIONED TWO DAUGHTERS SAID MISTER DORRIT AGAIN IT WOULD THEREFORE SAID MISSUS GENERAL BE NECESSARY TO ADD A THIRD MORE TO THE PAYMENT WHATEVER ITS AMOUNT MAY PROVE TO BE
2288-155711-0027 WHICH MY FRIENDS HERE HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO MAKE TO MY BANKERS MISTER DORRIT LOST NO TIME IN REFERRING THE DELICATE QUESTION TO THE COUNTY WIDOWER AND FINDING THAT HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO PAY THREE HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR TO THE CREDIT OF MISSUS GENERAL
2288-155711-0028 ARRIVED WITHOUT ANY SEVERE STRAIN ON HIS ARITHMETIC AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HIMSELF MUST PAY FOUR MISSUS GENERAL BEING AN ARTICLE OF THAT LUSTROUS SURFACE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT IT IS WORTH ANY MONEY
2288-155711-0029 MISSUS GENERAL CONCEDED THAT HIGH PRIVILEGE AND HERE SHE WAS IN PERSON MISSUS GENERAL INCLUDING HER SKIRTS WHICH HAD MUCH TO DO WITH IT WAS OF A DIGNIFIED AND IMPOSING APPEARANCE AMPLE RUSTLING
2288-155711-0030 GRAVELY VOLUMINOUS ALWAYS UPRIGHT BEHIND THE PROPRIETIES SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THE TOP OF THE ALPS AND THE BOTTOM OF HERCULANEUM WITHOUT DISARRANGING A FOLD IN HER DRESS OR DISPLACING A PIN
2288-155711-0031 IF HER COUNTENANCE AND HAIR HAD RATHER A FLOURY APPEARANCE AS THOUGH FROM LIVING IN SOME TRANSCENDENTLY GENTEEL MILL IT WAS RATHER BECAUSE SHE WAS A CHALKY CREATION ALTOGETHER THAN BECAUSE SHE MENDED HER COMPLEXION WITH VIOLET POWDER
2288-155711-0032 OR HAD TURNED GREY IF HER EYES HAD NO EXPRESSION IT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY HAD NOTHING TO EXPRESS IF SHE HAD FEW WRINKLES IT WAS BECAUSE HER MIND HAD NEVER TRACED ITS NAME OR ANY OTHER INSCRIPTION ON HER FACE A COOL
2288-155711-0033 WAXY BLOWN OUT WOMAN WHO HAD NEVER LIGHTED WELL MISSUS GENERAL HAD NO OPINIONS HER WAY OF FORMING A MIND WAS TO PREVENT IT FROM FORMING OPINIONS SHE HAD A LITTLE CIRCULAR SET OF MENTAL GROOVES OR RAILS
2288-155711-0034 ON WHICH SHE STARTED LITTLE TRAINS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS WHICH NEVER OVERTOOK ONE ANOTHER AND NEVER GOT ANYWHERE EVEN HER PROPRIETY COULD NOT DISPUTE THAT THERE WAS IMPROPRIETY IN THE WORLD
2288-155711-0035 BUT MISSUS GENERAL'S WAY OF GETTING RID OF IT WAS TO PUT IT OUT OF SIGHT AND MAKE BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH THING THIS WAS ANOTHER OF HER WAYS OF FORMING A MIND TO CRAM ALL ARTICLES OF DIFFICULTY INTO CUPBOARDS
2288-155711-0036 ACCIDENTS MISERIES AND OFFENCES WERE NEVER TO BE MENTIONED BEFORE HER PASSION WAS TO GO TO SLEEP IN THE PRESENCE OF MISSUS GENERAL AND BLOOD WAS TO CHANGE TO MILK AND WATER
2288-155711-0037 WHEN ALL THESE DEDUCTIONS WERE MADE IT WAS MISSUS GENERAL'S PROVINCE TO VARNISH
2288-155711-0038 SHE DIPPED THE SMALLEST OF BRUSHES INTO THE LARGEST OF POTS AND VARNISHED THE SURFACE OF EVERY OBJECT THAT CAME UNDER CONSIDERATION THE MORE CRACKED IT WAS THE MORE MISSUS GENERAL VARNISHED IT
2288-155711-0039 THERE WAS VARNISH IN MISSUS GENERAL'S VOICE VARNISH IN MISSUS GENERAL'S TOUCH AN ATMOSPHERE OF VARNISH ROUND MISSUS GENERAL'S FIGURE MISSUS GENERAL'S DREAMS OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN VARNISHED
