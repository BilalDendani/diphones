3757-134142-0000 I HOPE I DIDN'T FRIGHTEN YOU I STAMMERED OUT AT LAST I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I SAID I WAS DREAMING YOU SAID UGGUG INDEED THE YOUNG LADY REPLIED WITH QUIVERING LIPS THAT WOULD CURVE THEMSELVES INTO A SMILE
3757-134142-0001 AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T SAY IT YOU SHOUTED IT I'M VERY SORRY WAS ALL I COULD SAY FEELING VERY PENITENT AND HELPLESS SHE HAS SYLVIE'S EYES I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
3757-134142-0002 BUT SYLVIE HASN'T GOT THAT CALM RESOLUTE MOUTH NOR THAT FAR AWAY LOOK OF DREAMY SADNESS LIKE ONE THAT HAS HAD SOME DEEP SORROW VERY LONG AGO AND THE THICK COMING FANCIES ALMOST PREVENTED MY HEARING THE LADY'S NEXT WORDS
3757-134142-0003 SOMETHING ABOUT GHOSTS OR DYNAMITE OR MIDNIGHT MURDER ONE COULD UNDERSTAND IT THOSE THINGS AREN'T WORTH THE SHILLING UNLESS THEY GIVE ONE A NIGHTMARE BUT REALLY WITH ONLY A MEDICAL TREATISE YOU KNOW AND SHE GLANCED WITH A PRETTY SHRUG OF CONTEMPT AT THE BOOK OVER WHICH I HAD FALLEN ASLEEP
3757-134142-0004 HER FRIENDLINESS AND UTTER UNRESERVE TOOK ME ABACK FOR A MOMENT YET THERE WAS NO TOUCH OF FORWARDNESS OR BOLDNESS ABOUT THE CHILD FOR CHILD ALMOST SHE SEEMED TO BE I GUESSED HER AT SCARCELY OVER TWENTY
3757-134142-0005 ALL WAS THE INNOCENT FRANKNESS OF SOME ANGELIC VISITANT NEW TO THE WAYS OF EARTH AND THE CONVENTIONALISMS OR IF YOU WILL THE BARBARISMS OF SOCIETY EVEN SO I MUSED WILL SYLVIE LOOK AND SPEAK IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS
3757-134142-0006 YOU DON'T CARE FOR GHOSTS THEN I VENTURED TO SUGGEST UNLESS THEY ARE REALLY TERRIFYING QUITE SO THE LADY ASSENTED THE REGULAR RAILWAY GHOSTS I MEAN THE GHOSTS OF ORDINARY RAILWAY LITERATURE
3757-134142-0007 I FEEL INCLINED TO SAY WITH ALEXANDER SELKIRK
3757-134142-0008 THEY COULDN'T WELTER IN GORE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES WELTERING IN GORE IS A VERY EXPRESSIVE PHRASE CERTAINLY CAN IT BE DONE IN ANY FLUID I WONDER
3757-134142-0009 FOR INSTANCE YOU MIGHT WELTER IN BREAD SAUCE THAT BEING WHITE WOULD BE MORE SUITABLE FOR A GHOST
3757-134142-0010 YOU HAVE A REAL GOOD TERRIFYING GHOST IN THAT BOOK I HINTED HOW COULD YOU GUESS SHE EXCLAIMED WITH THE MOST ENGAGING FRANKNESS AND PLACED THE VOLUME IN MY HANDS I OPENED IT EAGERLY
3757-134142-0011 WITH A NOT UNPLEASANT THRILL LIKE WHAT A GOOD GHOST STORY GIVES ONE AT THE UNCANNY COINCIDENCE OF MY HAVING SO UNEXPECTEDLY DIVINED THE SUBJECT OF HER STUDIES IT WAS A BOOK OF DOMESTIC COOKERY OPEN AT THE ARTICLE BREAD SAUCE
3757-134142-0012 I RETURNED THE BOOK LOOKING I SUPPOSE A LITTLE BLANK AS THE LADY LAUGHED MERRILY AT MY DISCOMFITURE IT'S FAR MORE EXCITING THAN SOME OF THE MODERN GHOSTS I ASSURE YOU NOW THERE WAS A GHOST LAST MONTH
3757-134142-0013 THREE SCORE YEARS AND TEN BALDNESS AND SPECTACLES HAVE THEIR ADVANTAGES AFTER ALL I SAID TO MYSELF INSTEAD OF A BASHFUL YOUTH AND MAIDEN GASPING OUT MONOSYLLABLES AT AWFUL INTERVALS
3757-134142-0014 HERE WE HAVE AN OLD MAN AND A CHILD QUITE AT THEIR EASE TALKING AS IF THEY HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS THEN YOU THINK I CONTINUED ALOUD THAT WE OUGHT SOMETIMES TO ASK A GHOST TO SIT DOWN BUT HAVE WE ANY AUTHORITY FOR IT
3757-134142-0015 THE LADY LOOKED PUZZLED AND THOUGHTFUL FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE ALMOST CLAPPED HER HANDS
3757-134142-0016 HE MAKES HAMLET SAY REST REST PERTURBED SPIRIT AND THAT I SUPPOSE MEANS AN EASY CHAIR AN AMERICAN ROCKING CHAIR I THINK FAYFIELD JUNCTION MY LADY CHANGE FOR ELVESTON THE GUARD ANNOUNCED FLINGING OPEN THE DOOR OF THE CARRIAGE
3757-134142-0017 AND WE SOON FOUND OURSELVES WITH ALL OUR PORTABLE PROPERTY AROUND US ON THE PLATFORM THE ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED FOR PASSENGERS WAITING AT THIS JUNCTION WAS DISTINCTLY INADEQUATE A SINGLE WOODEN BENCH APPARENTLY INTENDED FOR THREE SITTERS ONLY
3757-134142-0018 IN A SMOCK FROCK WHO SAT WITH ROUNDED SHOULDERS AND DROOPING HEAD AND WITH HANDS CLASPED ON THE TOP OF HIS STICK SO AS TO MAKE A SORT OF PILLOW FOR THAT WRINKLED FACE WITH ITS LOOK OF PATIENT WEARINESS COME YOU BE OFF THE STATION MASTER ROUGHLY ACCOSTED THE POOR OLD MAN
3757-134142-0019 THIS WAY MY LADY HE ADDED IN A PERFECTLY DIFFERENT TONE IF YOUR LADYSHIP WILL TAKE A SEAT
3757-134142-0020 TO THE ADDRESS LEGIBLE ON THE PILE OF LUGGAGE WHICH ANNOUNCED THEIR OWNER TO BE LADY MURIEL ORME PASSENGER TO ELVESTON VIA FAYFIELD JUNCTION AS I WATCHED THE OLD MAN SLOWLY RISE TO HIS FEET AND HOBBLE A FEW PACES DOWN THE PLATFORM
3757-134142-0021 THE LINES CAME TO MY LIPS FROM SACKCLOTH COUCH THE MONK AROSE
3757-134142-0022 I MOVED AWAY A FEW STEPS AND WAITED TO FOLLOW HER INTO THE CARRIAGE WHERE I RESUMED THE CONVERSATION
3757-134142-0023 PERTURBED SPIRIT IS SUCH A HAPPY PHRASE PERTURBED REFERRING NO DOUBT SHE REJOINED
3757-134142-0024 IF STEAM HAS DONE NOTHING ELSE IT HAS AT LEAST ADDED A WHOLE NEW SPECIES TO ENGLISH LITERATURE NO DOUBT OF IT I ECHOED THE TRUE ORIGIN OF ALL OUR MEDICAL BOOKS AND ALL OUR COOKERY BOOKS
3757-134142-0025 BUT THE BOOKLETS THE LITTLE THRILLING ROMANCES WHERE THE MURDER COMES AT PAGE FIFTEEN AND THE WEDDING AT PAGE FORTY SURELY THEY ARE DUE TO STEAM AND WHEN WE TRAVEL BY ELECTRICITY IF I MAY VENTURE TO DEVELOP YOUR THEORY WE SHALL HAVE LEAFLETS INSTEAD OF BOOKLETS
3757-134142-0026 A DEVELOPMENT WORTHY OF DARWIN THE LADY EXCLAIMED ENTHUSIASTICALLY ONLY YOU REVERSE HIS THEORY
3757-134142-0027 I THOUGHT I SAW I MURMURED SLEEPILY AND THEN THE PHRASE INSISTED ON CONJUGATING ITSELF AND RAN INTO YOU THOUGHT YOU SAW HE THOUGHT HE SAW AND THEN IT SUDDENLY WENT OFF INTO A SONG
3757-134142-0028 HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ELEPHANT THAT PRACTISED ON A FIFE HE LOOKED AGAIN AND FOUND IT WAS A LETTER FROM HIS WIFE AT LENGTH I REALISE HE SAID THE BITTERNESS OF LIFE AND WHAT A WILD BEING IT WAS WHO SANG THESE WILD WORDS
3757-134142-0029 A GARDENER HE SEEMED TO BE YET SURELY A MAD ONE BY THE WAY HE BRANDISHED HIS RAKE MADDER BY THE WAY HE BROKE EVER AND ANON INTO A FRANTIC JIG
3757-134142-0030 THAT HE HAD THE FEET OF AN ELEPHANT BUT THE REST OF HIM WAS SKIN AND BONE AND THE WISPS OF LOOSE STRAW THAT BRISTLED ALL ABOUT HIM SUGGESTED THAT HE HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY STUFFED WITH IT AND THAT NEARLY ALL THE STUFFING HAD COME OUT
3757-134142-0031 THEN SYLVIE ADVANCED ALONE BRUNO HAVING SUDDENLY TURNED SHY
3757-134142-0032 PLEASE I'M SYLVIE AND WHO'S THAT OTHER THING SAID THE GARDENER WHAT THING SAID SYLVIE LOOKING ROUND OH THAT'S BRUNO HE'S MY BROTHER
3757-134142-0033 I COULD BUT RUB MY EYES AND SAY WHERE THEN ARE THE RAGS GONE TO FOR THE OLD MAN WAS NOW DRESSED IN ROYAL ROBES THAT GLITTERED WITH JEWELS AND GOLD EMBROIDERY
