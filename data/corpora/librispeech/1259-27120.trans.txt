1259-27120-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE TWO LADIES RETIRED TO DRESS AND AT HALF PAST SIX ELIZABETH WAS SUMMONED TO DINNER TO THE CIVIL INQUIRIES WHICH THEN POURED IN AND AMONGST WHICH SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DISTINGUISHING THE MUCH SUPERIOR SOLICITUDE OF MISTER BINGLEY'S
1259-27120-0001 SHE COULD NOT MAKE A VERY FAVOURABLE ANSWER JANE WAS BY NO MEANS BETTER THE SISTERS ON HEARING THIS REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES HOW MUCH THEY WERE GRIEVED HOW SHOCKING IT WAS TO HAVE A BAD COLD AND HOW EXCESSIVELY THEY DISLIKED BEING ILL THEMSELVES
1259-27120-0002 AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE WHEN NOT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THEM RESTORED ELIZABETH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HER FORMER DISLIKE THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY
1259-27120-0003 HIS ANXIETY FOR JANE WAS EVIDENT AND HIS ATTENTIONS TO HERSELF MOST PLEASING AND THEY PREVENTED HER FEELING HERSELF SO MUCH AN INTRUDER AS SHE BELIEVED SHE WAS CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS SHE HAD VERY LITTLE NOTICE FROM ANY BUT HIM MISS BINGLEY WAS ENGROSSED BY MISTER DARCY
1259-27120-0004 HER SISTER SCARCELY LESS SO AND AS FOR MISTER HURST BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN WHO LIVED ONLY TO EAT DRINK AND PLAY AT CARDS WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER
1259-27120-0005 WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM HER MANNERS WERE PRONOUNCED TO BE VERY BAD INDEED A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND IMPERTINENCE SHE HAD NO CONVERSATION NO STYLE NO BEAUTY
1259-27120-0006 SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY COUNTENANCE VERY NONSENSICAL TO COME AT ALL
1259-27120-0007 BE SCAMPERING ABOUT THE COUNTRY
1259-27120-0008 SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND THE GOWN WHICH HAD BEEN LET DOWN TO HIDE IT NOT DOING ITS OFFICE YOUR PICTURE MAY BE VERY EXACT LOUISA SAID BINGLEY
1259-27120-0009 AND ALONE QUITE ALONE WHAT COULD SHE MEAN BY IT IT SEEMS TO ME TO SHOW AN ABOMINABLE SORT OF CONCEITED INDEPENDENCE A MOST COUNTRY TOWN INDIFFERENCE TO DECORUM
1259-27120-0010 IT SHOWS AN AFFECTION FOR HER SISTER THAT IS VERY PLEASING SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAS RATHER AFFECTED YOUR ADMIRATION OF HER FINE EYES
1259-27120-0011 CRIED BINGLEY IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT
1259-27120-0012 AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS WITH A RENEWAL OF TENDERNESS HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO HER ROOM ON LEAVING THE DINING PARLOUR AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL
1259-27120-0013 TILL LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH
1259-27120-0014 SHE DECLINED IT AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE
1259-27120-0015 SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE I DESERVE NEITHER SUCH PRAISE NOR SUCH CENSURE CRIED ELIZABETH I AM NOT A GREAT READER
1259-27120-0016 AND I HAVE PLEASURE IN MANY THINGS IN NURSING YOUR SISTER I AM SURE YOU HAVE PLEASURE SAID BINGLEY
1259-27120-0017 AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO ELIZABETH ASSURED HIM THAT SHE COULD SUIT HERSELF PERFECTLY WITH THOSE IN THE ROOM I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS
1259-27120-0018 WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE ADDED SO MUCH TO IT YOURSELF YOU ARE ALWAYS BUYING BOOKS
1259-27120-0019 I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE NEGLECT OF A FAMILY LIBRARY IN SUCH DAYS AS THESE
1259-27120-0020 I WISH IT MAY BE HALF AS DELIGHTFUL AS PEMBERLEY I WISH IT MAY BUT I WOULD REALLY ADVISE YOU TO MAKE YOUR PURCHASE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TAKE PEMBERLEY FOR A KIND OF MODEL
1259-27120-0021 WITH ALL MY HEART I WILL BUY PEMBERLEY ITSELF IF DARCY WILL SELL IT
1259-27120-0022 I SHOULD THINK IT MORE POSSIBLE TO GET PEMBERLEY BY PURCHASE THAN BY IMITATION ELIZABETH WAS SO MUCH CAUGHT WITH WHAT PASSED AS TO LEAVE HER VERY LITTLE ATTENTION FOR HER BOOK AND SOON LAYING IT WHOLLY ASIDE SHE DREW NEAR THE CARD TABLE
1259-27120-0023 AND STATIONED HERSELF BETWEEN MISTER BINGLEY AND HIS ELDEST SISTER TO OBSERVE THE GAME
1259-27120-0024 SHE IS NOW ABOUT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET'S HEIGHT OR RATHER TALLER HOW I LONG TO SEE HER AGAIN
1259-27120-0025 SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS
1259-27120-0026 SAID BINGLEY HOW YOUNG LADIES CAN HAVE PATIENCE TO BE SO VERY ACCOMPLISHED AS THEY ALL ARE ALL
1259-27120-0027 YOUR LIST OF THE COMMON EXTENT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS SAID DARCY HAS TOO MUCH TRUTH
1259-27120-0028 I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED
1259-27120-0029 SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT OH CERTAINLY CRIED HIS FAITHFUL ASSISTANT
1259-27120-0030 SINGING DRAWING DANCING AND THE MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESERVE THE WORD
1259-27120-0031 AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
1259-27120-0032 I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY BOTH CRIED OUT AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF HER IMPLIED DOUBT AND WERE BOTH PROTESTING THAT THEY KNEW MANY WOMEN WHO ANSWERED THIS DESCRIPTION
1259-27120-0033 WHEN MISTER HURST CALLED THEM TO ORDER WITH BITTER COMPLAINTS OF THEIR INATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD AS ALL CONVERSATION WAS THEREBY AT AN END ELIZABETH SOON AFTERWARDS LEFT THE ROOM ELIZABETH BENNET
1259-27120-0034 AND WITH MANY MEN I DARE SAY IT SUCCEEDS BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS A PALTRY DEVICE A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED
