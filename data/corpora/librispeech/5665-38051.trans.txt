5665-38051-0008 MISSUS TOOMEY BRAIDED A WISP OF HAIR TO AN INFINITESIMAL END AND SAID FIRMLY JAP WE'VE SIMPLY GOT TO DO SOMETHING CAN'T YOU BORROW BORROW

5665-38051-0012 HIS DAMNED INSOLENCE EVERY TIME I SEE HIM GOING INTO HIS SHACK OVER THERE HE NODDED TOWARDS THE DIAGONAL CORNER
5665-38051-0013 HIS BUILDING IT TO SAVE HOTEL BILLS WHEN HE COMES TO TOWN YES IRONICALLY I CAN SEE HIM LENDING ME MONEY MISSUS TOOMEY SAT UP AND CRIED EXCITEDLY

5665-38051-0016 BUT IN THE DARKNESS MISSUS TOOMEY CRIED QUIETLY SELLING TICKETS FOR A RAFFLE WHICH WAS FOR THEIR PERSONAL BENEFIT SEEMED A KIND OF GENTEEL BEGGING SHE WONDERED THAT JAP DID NOT FEEL AS SHE DID ABOUT IT
5665-38051-0017 AND WHAT WOULD MISSUS PANTIN THINK
5665-38051-0018 THE WIND HAD RISEN TO A GALE AND SHE THOUGHT NERVOUSLY OF FRINGED NAPKINS AND PILLOW SLIPS THE WIND ALWAYS GAVE HER THE BLUES ANYWAY AND NOW IT REMINDED HER OF WINTER WHICH WAS CLOSE WITH ITS BITTER COLD
5665-38051-0019 OF SNOW DRIVEN ACROSS TRACKLESS WASTES OF GAUNT PREDATORY ANIMALS OF CATTLE AND HORSES STARVING IN DRAWS AND GULCHES AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS WHICH WINTER MEANT IN THAT BARREN COUNTRY
5665-38051-0020 SHE SLEPT AFTER A TIME TO FIND THE NEXT MORNING THAT THE WIND STILL HOWLED AND THE FRINGE ON HER LAUNDRY WAS ALL SHE HAD PICTURED TOOMEY SET FORTH GAILY IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST WITH THE PUNCH BOWL WRAPPED IN A NEWSPAPER
5665-38051-0021 AND MISSUS TOOMEY NERVED HERSELF TO NEGOTIATE FOR THE SALE OF THE TEAPOT TO MISSUS SUDDS IN THE EVENT OF HIS BEING UNSUCCESSFUL SHE WATCHED FOR HIS RETURN EAGERLY BUT IT WAS TWO O'CLOCK BEFORE SHE SAW HIM COMING
5665-38051-0022 LEANING AGAINST THE WIND AND CLASPING THE PUNCH BOWL TO HIS BOSOM HER HEART SANK FOR HIS FACE TOLD HER THE RESULT WITHOUT ASKING TOOMEY SET UNCLE JASPER'S WEDDING GIFT UPON THE DINING ROOM TABLE WITH DISRESPECTFUL VIOLENCE
5665-38051-0023 YOU MUST BE CRAZY TO THINK I COULD SELL THAT IN PROUTY YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER DIDN'T ANYBODY WANT IT JAP MISSUS TOOMEY ASKED TIMIDLY WANT IT ANGRILY
5665-38051-0024 TINHORN THOUGHT IT WAS SOME KIND OF A TONY CUSPIDOR AND A ROUND UP COOK OFFERED ME A DOLLAR AND A HALF FOR IT TO SET BREAD SPONGE IN NEVER MIND SOOTHINGLY I'M SURE MISSUS SUDDS WILL TAKE THE TEAPOT
5665-38051-0025 WE CAN'T LIVE ALL WINTER ON A TEAPOT HE ANSWERED GLOOMILY BUT YOU'RE SURE TO GET INTO SOMETHING PRETTY QUICK NOW WHEN I LAND I'LL LAND BIG I'LL LAND WITH BOTH FEET HE RESPONDED MORE CHEERFULLY
5665-38051-0026 OF COURSE YOU WILL I NEVER DOUBT IT MISSUS TOOMEY ENDEAVORED TO MAKE HER TONE CONVINCING LET'S HAVE TEA IN THE HEIRLOOM BEFORE WE PART WITH IT SHE SUGGESTED BRIGHTLY IT'S NEVER BEEN USED THAT I CAN REMEMBER
5665-38051-0027 IT'S UGLY ENOUGH TO BE VALUABLE TOOMEY OBSERVED EYEING THE TEAPOT AS SHE TOOK IT FROM THE TOP OF THE BOOKCASE SOLID NEARLY AND CAME OVER IN THE MAYFLOWER MISSUS TOOMEY REPLIED PROUDLY
5665-38051-0028 WE'LL HAVE TEA AND TOAST AND CODFISH THE INFORMATION IS SUPERFLUOUS TOOMEY SNIFFED THE AIR AND MADE A WRY FACE I'D AS SOON EAT BILLPOSTER'S PASTE AS CODFISH
5665-38051-0029 TO NIGHT WE'LL HAVE STEAK THICK LIKE THAT
5665-38051-0030 TOOMEY EYED THE CODFISH DARKLY WHEN HIS WIFE PLACED IT ON THE TABLE SIT DOWN JAP SHE URGED THE TEA WILL BE STEEPED IN JUST A SECOND DON'T WAIT A SCREAM COMPLETED THE SENTENCE
5665-38051-0031 TOOMEY OVERTURNED HIS CHAIR AS HE RUSHED TO THE KITCHEN HE ARRIVED IN TIME TO SEE THE LID OF THE PRICELESS HEIRLOOM DISAPPEARING IN A PUDDLE OF PEWTER IT SEEMED TO THE TOOMEYS THAT THE FATES HAD SINGLED THEM OUT AS SPECIAL OBJECTS FOR THEIR MALEVOLENCE
5665-38051-0032 THE WIND CONTINUED TO BLOW AS THOUGH IT MEANT NEVER TO STOP IT WAS A WIND OF WHICH THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST WHO SPEAK AWESOMELY OF THEIR OWN GALES AND TEMPEST WOT NOT
5665-38051-0033 THIS WIND WHICH HAD KEPT PROUTY INDOORS FOR CLOSE TO A WEEK CAME OUT OF A CLOUDLESS SKY SAVE FOR A FEW INNOCENT LOOKING STREAKS ON THE WESTERN HORIZON IT HAD BLOWN AWAY EVERYTHING THAT WOULD MOVE
5665-38051-0034 ALL THE LOOSE PAPERS HAD SAILED THROUGH THE AIR TO AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION NEBRASKA PERHAPS WHILE AN ENDLESS PROCESSION OF TUMBLE WEED HAD ROLLED IN THE SAME DIRECTION FROM AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY IN THE WEST
5665-38051-0035 FOUND THEIR SATISFACTION SHORT LIVED FOR AS QUICKLY THEY ACQUIRED THE RUBBISH THAT BELONGED TO THEIR NEIGHBOR ON THE OTHER SIDE SHINGLES FLEW OFF AND CHIMNEY BRICKS
5665-38051-0036 AND ENDS OF CORRUGATED IRON ROOFING SLAPPED AND BANGED AS THOUGH FRANTIC TO BE LOOSE HOUSES SHIVERED ON THEIR FOUNDATIONS AND LESSER BUILDINGS LAY ON THEIR SIDES CLOUDS OF DUST OBSCURED THE SUN AT INTERVALS
5665-38051-0037 AND THE SHARP EDGED GRAVEL DRIVEN BEFORE THE GALE CUT LIKE TINY KNIVES ANY DARING CHICKEN THAT VENTURED FROM ITS COOP SLID AWAY AS IF IT WERE ON SKATES PITCHFORKS WERE USELESS
5665-38051-0038 AND THOSE WHO HAD HORSES TO FEED CARRIED THE HAY IN SACKS THE CAGED INHABITANTS STOOD AT THEIR WINDOWS AND MADE CAUSTIC COMMENTS UPON THE LEGS AND GENERAL CONTOUR OF SUCH UNFORTUNATES AS NECESSITY TOOK OUT
5665-38051-0039 WHILE THOSE PEDESTRIANS WHO WOULD CONVERSE UPON CATCHING SIGHT OF EACH OTHER MADE A DIVE FOR THE NEAREST TELEPHONE POLE THERE CLINGING BY AN ARM LIKE A SHIPWRECKED SAILOR TO A MAST
5665-38051-0040 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE EARTH WOULD SOON BE DENUDED OF ITS SOIL LEAVING THE ROCKS EXPOSED LIKE A SKELETON STRIPPED OF ITS FLESH
5665-38051-0041 WAS AS VARIED AS THAT OF DRINK NO ONE COULD SEEM TO REMEMBER THAT THE WIND HAD NOT ALWAYS BLOWN OR REALIZE THAT IT WOULD SOMETIME STOP NO CHARACTER WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN A PERFECT EQUILIBRIUM AFTER THREE DAYS OF IT
5665-38051-0042 LOGIC OR PHILOSOPHY MADE NO MORE IMPRESSION UPON THE MENTAL STATE THAN WATER SLIPPING OVER A ROCK IT SET THE NERVES ON EDGE IRRITATION RESTLESSNESS AND DISCONTENT WERE AS UNCONTROLLABLE AS GREAT FEAR
5665-38051-0043 TWO WILDCATS TIED TOGETHER WERE NOT MORE INCOMPATIBLE THAN HUSBANDS AND WIVES WHO UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS LIVED TOGETHER HAPPILY DOTING MOTHERS BECAME SHREWS
5665-38051-0044 FOND FATHERS BRUTES LAMBASTING THEIR OFFSPRING ON THE SMALLEST PRETEXT WHILE SEVEN WAS TOO CONSERVATIVE AN ESTIMATE TO PLACE UPON THE DEVILS OF WHICH THE CHILDREN WHO TURNED THE HOUSE INTO BEDLAM SEEMED TO BE POSSESSED
5665-38051-0045 OPTIMISTS GREW GREEN WITH MELANCHOLIA PESSIMISTS CONSIDERED SUICIDE AS AN ESCAPE FROM THE FUTILITY OF LIFE NEIGHBORS RESURRECTED BURIED HATCHETS FRIENDS FOUND FAULT WITH FRIENDS
5665-38051-0046 ENEMIES VOWED TO KILL EACH OTHER AS SOON AS THE WIND LET UP IF THE COMBINATION OF WIND AND ALTITUDE HAD THIS EFFECT UPON PHLEGMATIC TEMPERAMENTS SOMETHING OF MISSUS TOOMEY'S STATE MAY BE SURMISED
5665-38051-0047 WITH NERVES ALREADY OVERWROUGHT THIS PROLONGED WINDSTORM PUT HER IN A CONDITION IN WHICH AS SHE DECLARED HYSTERICALLY TO HER HUSBAND SHE WAS READY TO FLY LYING ON HIS BACK
5665-38051-0048 ON THE ONE TIME HANDSOME SOFA WHERE HE SPENT MANY OF HIS WAKING HOURS
