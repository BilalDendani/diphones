1343-158796-0000 NO DOUBT LORD FAWN WAS A MAN SUBSERVIENT TO THE LEADERS OF HIS PARTY MUCH AFRAID OF THE HARD JUDGMENT OF THOSE WITH WHOM HE WAS CONCERNED PAINFULLY OPEN TO IMPRESSION FROM WHAT HE WOULD HAVE CALLED PUBLIC OPINION TO A CERTAIN EXTENT A COWARD
1343-158796-0001 MOST ANXIOUS TO DO RIGHT SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE ACCUSED OF BEING IN THE WRONG AND AT THE SAME TIME GIFTED WITH BUT LITTLE OF THAT INSIGHT INTO THINGS WHICH TEACHES MEN TO KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG
1343-158796-0002 LADY GLENCORA HAVING PERCEIVED ALL THIS FELT THAT HE WAS A MAN UPON WHOM A FEW WORDS FROM HER MIGHT HAVE AN EFFECT BUT EVEN LADY GLENCORA MIGHT HESITATE TO TELL A GENTLEMAN THAT HE OUGHT TO MARRY A LADY
1343-158796-0003 WHEN THE GENTLEMAN HAD ALREADY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF NOT MARRYING AND HAD ATTEMPTED TO JUSTIFY HIS DECISION ALMOST PUBLICLY BY A REFERENCE TO THE LADY'S CONDUCT LADY GLENCORA ALMOST FELT THAT SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN TOO MUCH
1343-158796-0004 AS SHE TURNED OVER IN HER MIND THE MEANS SHE HAD OF PERFORMING HER PROMISE TO LADY EUSTACE THE FIVE FARTHING BILL HAD BEEN LAID UPON THE TABLE ON A TUESDAY AND WAS TO BE READ THE FIRST TIME ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY WEEK
1343-158796-0005 ON THE WEDNESDAY LADY GLENCORA HAD WRITTEN TO THE DUKE AND HAD CALLED IN HERTFORD STREET ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY SHE WAS AT MATCHING LOOKING AFTER THE DUKE BUT SHE RETURNED TO LONDON ON THE TUESDAY
1343-158796-0006 AND ON THE WEDNESDAY THERE WAS A LITTLE DINNER AT MISTER PALLISER'S HOUSE GIVEN AVOWEDLY WITH THE OBJECT OF FURTHER FRIENDLY DISCUSSION RESPECTING THE NEW PALLISER PENNY THE PRIME MINISTER WAS TO BE THERE
1343-158796-0007 AND THOSE SPECIAL MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT WHO WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR GIVING SPECIAL HELP TO THE FINANCIAL HERCULES OF THE DAY A QUESTION PERHAPS OF NO GREAT PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE HAD OCCURRED TO MISTER PALLISER
1343-158796-0008 BUT ONE WHICH IF OVERLOOKED MIGHT BE FATAL TO THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF THE MEASURE THERE IS SO MUCH IN A NAME AND THEN AN OUNCE OF RIDICULE IS OFTEN MORE POTENT THAN A HUNDREDWEIGHT OF ARGUMENT
1343-158796-0009 BY WHAT DENOMINATION SHOULD THE FIFTH PART OF A PENNY BE HEREAFTER KNOWN SOME ONE HAD ILL NATUREDLY WHISPERED TO MISTER PALLISER THAT A FARTHING MEANT A FOURTH AND AT ONCE THERE AROSE A NEW TROUBLE
1343-158796-0010 WHICH FOR A TIME BORE VERY HEAVILY ON HIM SHOULD HE BOLDLY DISREGARD THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE USEFUL OLD WORD OR SHOULD HE VENTURE ON THE DANGERS OF NEW NOMENCLATURE
1343-158796-0011 OCTOBER AS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IS STILL THE TENTH MONTH OF THE YEAR NOVEMBER THE ELEVENTH AND SO ON THOUGH BY THESE NAMES THEY ARE SO PLAINLY CALLED THE EIGHTH AND NINTH ALL FRANCE TRIED TO RID ITSELF OF THIS ABSURDITY AND FAILED
1343-158796-0012 SHOULD HE STICK BY THE FARTHING OR SHOULD HE CALL IT A FIFTHING A QUINT OR A SEMITENTH THERE'S THE FORTNIGHTLY REVIEW COMES OUT BUT ONCE A MONTH HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND MISTER BONTEEN
1343-158796-0013 MISTER GRESHAM HAD EXPRESSED AN OPINION SOMEWHAT OFF HAND THAT ENGLISH PEOPLE WOULD NEVER BE GOT TO TALK ABOUT QUINTS AND SO THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY A LITTLE DINNER WAS THEREFORE ARRANGED AND MISTER PALLISER
1343-158796-0014 AS WAS HIS CUSTOM IN SUCH MATTERS PUT THE AFFAIR OF THE DINNER INTO HIS WIFE'S HANDS WHEN HE WAS TOLD THAT SHE HAD INCLUDED LORD FAWN AMONG THE GUESTS HE OPENED HIS EYES LORD FAWN
1343-158796-0015 WHO MIGHT BE GOOD ENOUGH AT THE INDIA OFFICE KNEW LITERALLY NOTHING ABOUT THE PENNY HE'LL TAKE IT AS THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT IN THE WORLD SAID LADY GLENCORA I DON'T WANT TO PAY LORD FAWN A COMPLIMENT
1343-158796-0016 SAID MISTER PALLISER BUT I DO SAID LADY GLENCORA AND SO THE MATTER WAS ARRANGED IT WAS A VERY NICE LITTLE DINNER MISSUS GRESHAM AND MISSUS BONTEEN WERE THERE
1343-158796-0017 AND THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE DAY WAS SETTLED IN TWO MINUTES BEFORE THE GUESTS WENT OUT OF THE DRAWING ROOM STICK TO YOUR FARTHING SAID MISTER GRESHAM I THINK SO SAID MISTER PALLISER
1343-158796-0018 QUINT'S A VERY EASY WORD SAID MISTER BONTEEN BUT SQUINT IS AN EASIER SAID MISTER GRESHAM WITH ALL A PRIME MINISTER'S JOCOSE AUTHORITY THEY'D CERTAINLY BE CALLED COCK EYES
1343-158796-0019 THERE'S NOTHING OF THE SOUND OF A QUARTER IN FARTHING SAID MISTER PALLISER STICK TO THE OLD WORD
1343-158796-0020 LADY GLENCORA HAD EXACTED A PROMISE FROM LORD FAWN THAT HE WOULD RETURN TO THE DRAWING ROOM LADY GLENCORA WAS VERY CLEVER AT SUCH WORK AND SAID NOTHING THEN OF HER PURPOSE SHE DID NOT WANT HER GUESTS TO RUN AWAY
1343-158796-0021 AND THEREFORE LORD FAWN LORD FAWN ESPECIALLY MUST STAY IF HE WERE TO GO THERE WOULD BE NOTHING SPOKEN OF ALL THE EVENING BUT THAT WEARY NEW PENNY TO OBLIGE HER HE MUST REMAIN
1343-158796-0022 AND OF COURSE HE DID REMAIN WHOM DO YOU THINK I SAW THE OTHER DAY SAID LADY GLENCORA WHEN SHE GOT HER VICTIM INTO A CORNER OF COURSE LORD FAWN HAD NO IDEA WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE SEEN
1343-158796-0023 AND FOR A MOMENT HE WAS STRICKEN DUMB I DO FEEL FOR HER SO MUCH I THINK SHE HAS BEEN SO HARDLY USED HE WAS OBLIGED TO SAY SOMETHING
1343-158796-0024 MY NAME HAS OF COURSE BEEN MUCH MIXED UP WITH HERS YES LORD FAWN I KNOW IT HAS AND IT IS BECAUSE I AM SO SURE OF YOUR HIGH MINDED GENEROSITY AND AND THOROUGH DEVOTION
1343-158796-0025 THAT I HAVE VENTURED TO SPEAK TO YOU I AM SURE THERE IS NOTHING YOU WOULD WISH SO MUCH AS TO GET AT THE TRUTH CERTAINLY LADY GLENCORA ALL MANNER OF STORIES HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT HER
1343-158796-0026 AND AS I BELIEVE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST FOUNDATION THEY TELL ME NOW THAT SHE HAD AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO KEEP THE DIAMONDS THAT EVEN IF SIR FLORIAN DID NOT GIVE THEM TO HER THEY WERE HERS UNDER HIS WILL
1343-158796-0027 THOSE LAWYERS HAVE GIVEN UP ALL IDEA OF PROCEEDING AGAINST HER BECAUSE THE NECKLACE HAS BEEN STOLEN ALTOGETHER INDEPENDENTLY OF THAT DO YOU SEE MISTER EUSTACE AND ASK HIM IF WHAT I SAY IS NOT TRUE
1343-158796-0028 MISTER CAMPERDOWN THOUGHT THAT THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE GIVEN UP OH YES THAT'S THE MAN'S NAME A HORRID MAN I AM TOLD THAT HE WAS REALLY MOST CRUEL TO HER
1343-158796-0029 I DON'T THINK THEY QUITE SAID THAT LADY GLENCORA SOMETHING VERY MUCH LIKE IT LORD FAWN I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY OWN MIND WHO DID STEAL ALL THE THINGS WHO WAS IT OH
1343-158796-0030 ONE MUSTN'T MENTION NAMES IN SUCH AN AFFAIR WITHOUT EVIDENCE AT ANY RATE SHE HAS BEEN VERY BADLY TREATED AND I SHALL TAKE HER UP IF I WERE YOU I WOULD GO AND CALL UPON HER I WOULD INDEED
1343-158796-0031 I THINK YOU OWE IT TO HER WELL DUKE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PLANTAGENET'S PENNY NOW WILL IT EVER BE WORTH TWO HALFPENCE THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED OF THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY
1343-158796-0032 A GREAT NOBLEMAN WHOM ALL LIBERALS LOVED AND A MEMBER OF THE CABINET HE HAD COME IN SINCE DINNER AND HAD BEEN ASKING A QUESTION OR TWO AS TO WHAT HAD BEEN DECIDED WELL YES IF PROPERLY INVESTED I THINK IT WILL
1343-158796-0033 I'M GLAD THAT IT IS NOT TO CONTAIN FIVE SEMITENTHS A SEMITENTH WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN A POPULAR FORM OF MONEY IN ENGLAND WE HATE NEW NAMES SO MUCH THAT WE HAVE NOT YET GOT BEYOND TALKING OF FOURPENNY BITS
1343-158796-0034 THERE'S A GREAT DEAL IN A NAME ISN'T THERE YOU DON'T THINK THEY'LL CALL THEM PALLISERS OR PALLS OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT DO YOU I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO HEAR THAT UNDER THE NEW REGIME TWO LOLLYPOPS WERE TO COST THREE PALLS
1343-158796-0035 AND I MEAN TO SEE PALLISER'S MEASURE CARRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE OF LORDS NEXT SESSION I SHALL BE PAYING FOR MY MUTTON CHOPS AT THE CLUB AT SO MANY QUINTS A CHOP YET DON'T YOU THINK SO FAWN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK
