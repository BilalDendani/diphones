3483-119637-0000 SOME TWENTY MINUTES LATER THE SHIP ARRIVED IT SETTLED DOWN SLOWLY INTO THE RAVINE ON ITS REPELLER RAYS
3483-119637-0001 THERE IT WAS STOPPED AND FLOATED STEADILY
3483-119637-0002 INTO WHICH IT FITTED SNUGLY AND I STEPPED INTO THE INTERIOR OF A CRAFT NOT UNLIKE THE ONE WITH WHICH I HAD HAD MY FATEFUL ENCOUNTER THE CAGE BEING UNLOCKED THE CABIN IN WHICH I WAS CONFINED WAS NOT AN OUTSIDE COMPARTMENT BUT WAS EQUIPPED WITH A NUMBER OF VIEWPLATES
3483-119637-0003 THE SHIP ROSE TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND HEADED WESTWARD AT SUCH SPEED THAT THE HUM OF THE AIR PAST ITS SMOOTH PLATES ROSE TO A SHRILL ALMOST INAUDIBLE MOAN AFTER A LAPSE OF SOME HOURS WE CAME IN SIGHT OF AN IMPRESSIVE MOUNTAIN RANGE
3483-119637-0004 WHICH I CORRECTLY GUESSED TO BE THE ROCKIES SWERVING SLIGHTLY WE HEADED DOWN TOWARD ONE OF THE TOPMOST PINNACLES OF THE RANGE
3483-119637-0005 NOR WAS THERE ANY SHEEN OF SHIMMERING DISINTEGRATOR RAYS SURROUNDING IT TO INTERFERE WITH THE SPARKLING SIGHT SO FAR FLUNG WERE THE DEFENSES OF LO TAN I FOUND THAT IT WAS CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN AMERICAN ROCKET GUNNER TO GET WITHIN EFFECTIVE RANGE
3483-119637-0006 AND SO NUMEROUS WERE THE DIS RAY BATTERIES ON THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS AND IN THE RAVINES IN THIS ENCIRCLING LINE OF DEFENSES DRAWN ON A RADIUS OF NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED MILES THAT EVEN THE LARGEST CRAFT IN THE OPINION OF THE HANS
3483-119637-0007 COULD EASILY BE BROUGHT TO EARTH THROUGH AIR POCKETING TACTICS AND THIS I WAS THE MORE READY TO BELIEVE AFTER MY OWN RECENT EXPERIENCE I SPENT TWO MONTHS AS A PRISONER IN LO TAN
3483-119637-0008 EVERY ATTENTION WAS PAID TO MY PHYSICAL COMFORT LUXURIES WERE SHOWERED UPON ME
3483-119637-0009 MOST ELABORATELY STAGED ATTEMPTS AT SEDUCTION WERE MADE UPON ME WITH DRUGS WITH WOMEN HYPNOTISM WAS RESORTED TO VIEWPLATES WERE FAKED TO PICTURE TO ME THE COMPLETE ROUT OF AMERICAN FORCES ALL OVER THE CONTINENT
3483-119637-0010 WITH INCREDIBLE PATIENCE AND LABORING UNDER GREAT HANDICAPS IN VIEW OF THE VIGOR OF THE AMERICAN OFFENSIVE THE HAN INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT DUG UP THE FACT THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE FORCES SURROUNDING NU YOK I HAD LEFT BEHIND ME WILMA MY BRIDE OF LESS THAN A YEAR
3483-119637-0011 IN SOME MANNER I WILL NEVER TELL HOW THEY DISCOVERED SOME LIKENESS OF HER AND FAKED AN ELECTRONOSCOPIC PICTURE OF HER IN THE HANDS OF TORTURERS IN NU YOK IN WHICH SHE WAS SHOWN HOLDING OUT HER ARMS PITEOUSLY TOWARD ME AS THOUGH BEGGING ME TO SAVE HER BY SURRENDER
3483-119637-0012 SURRENDER OF WHAT STRANGELY ENOUGH THEY NEVER INDICATED THAT TO ME DIRECTLY AND TO THIS DAY I DO NOT KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY EXPECTED OR HOPED TO GET OUT OF ME
3483-119637-0013 THAT DID NOT SEEM REAL TO ME AND MY MIND STILL RESISTED I REMEMBER GAZING WITH STARING EYES AT THAT PICTURE THE SWEAT POURING DOWN MY FACE SEARCHING EAGERLY FOR SOME VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF FRAUD AND BEING UNABLE TO FIND IT IT WAS THE IDENTICAL LIKENESS OF WILMA
3483-119637-0014 PERHAPS HAD MY LOVE FOR HER BEEN LESS GREAT
3483-119637-0015 BUT ALL THE WHILE I KNEW SUBCONSCIOUSLY THAT THIS WAS NOT WILMA PRODUCT OF THE UTMOST OF NOBILITY IN THIS MODERN VIRILE RUGGED AMERICAN RACE SHE WOULD HAVE DIED UNDER EVEN WORSE TORTURE
3483-119637-0016 BEFORE SHE WOULD HAVE PLEADED WITH ME THIS WAY TO BETRAY MY RACE AND HER HONOR BUT THESE WERE THINGS THAT NOT EVEN THE MOST SKILLED OF THE HAN HYPNOTISTS AND PSYCHOANALYSTS COULD DRAG FROM ME THEIR INTELLIGENCE DIVISION ALSO FAILED TO PICK UP THE FACT
3483-119637-0017 THAT I WAS MYSELF THE PRODUCT OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND NOT THE TWENTY FIFTH HAD THEY DONE SO IT MIGHT HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SOME OF THEIR MOST SUBTLE MENTAL ASSAULTS MISSED FIRE
3483-119637-0018 THEIR HYPNOTISTS INFLICTED MANY HORRIFYING NIGHTMARES ON ME AND MADE ME DO AND SAY MANY THINGS THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IN MY RIGHT SENSES BUT EVEN IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WE HAD LEARNED THAT HYPNOTISM CANNOT MAKE A PERSON VIOLATE
3483-119637-0019 HIS FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF MORALITY AGAINST HIS WILL AND STEADFASTLY I STEELED MY WILL AGAINST THEM I HAVE SINCE THOUGHT THAT I WAS GREATLY AIDED BY MY NEWNESS TO THIS AGE
3483-119637-0020 BECOME ENTIRELY ATTUNED TO IT AND EVEN TODAY I CONFESS TO A LONGING WISH THAT MAN MIGHT TRAVEL BACKWARD AS WELL AS FORWARD IN TIME NOW THAT MY WILMA HAS BEEN AT REST THESE MANY YEARS
3483-119637-0021 AND TAKE UP MY OLD LIFE WHERE I LEFT IT OFF
3483-119637-0022 AND AT THE PERIOD OF WHICH I SPEAK I WAS LESS ATTUNED THAN NOW TO THE MODERN WORLD REAL AS MY LIFE WAS AND MY LOVE FOR MY WIFE THERE WAS MUCH ABOUT IT ALL THAT WAS LIKE A DREAM AND IN THE MIDST OF MY TORTURES BY THE HANS THIS COMPLEX
3483-119637-0023 THIS HABIT OF MANY MONTHS HELPED ME TO TELL MYSELF THAT THIS TOO WAS ALL A DREAM THAT I MUST NOT SUCCUMB FOR I WOULD WAKE UP IN A MOMENT AND SO THEY FAILED MORE THAN THAT I THINK I WON SOMETHING NEARER TO GENUINE RESPECT FROM THOSE AROUND ME
3483-119637-0024 THAN ANY OTHER HANS OF THAT GENERATION ACCORDED TO ANYBODY AMONG THESE WAS SAN LAN HIMSELF THE RULER IN THE END IT WAS HE WHO ORDERED THE CESSATION OF THESE TORTURES
3483-119637-0025 INSTEAD OF HAVING ME EXECUTED HE CONTINUED TO SHOWER LUXURIES AND ATTENTIONS ON ME
3483-119637-0026 ANOTHER WAS HIS FAVORITE CONCUBINE
3483-119637-0027 A CREATURE OF THE MOST ALLURING BEAUTY YOUNG GRACEFUL AND MOST DELICATELY SEDUCTIVE
3483-119637-0028 THIS CREATURE HIS MOST PRIZED POSSESSION SAN LAN WITH THE UTMOST MORAL CALLOUSNESS ORDERED TO SEDUCE ME URGING HER TO APPLY WITHOUT STINT AND TO ITS FULLEST EXTENT HER KNOWLEDGE OF EVIL ARTS HAD I NOT SEEN THE NAKED HORROR OF HER SOUL
3483-119637-0029 THAT SHE LET CREEP INTO HER EYES FOR JUST ONE UNGUARDED INSTANT AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR MY CONVICTION OF WILMA'S FAITH IN ME I DO NOT KNOW WHAT BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT I RESISTED THIS ASSAULT ALSO HAD SAN LAN ONLY KNOWN IT
3483-119637-0030 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A BETTER CHANCE OF BREAKING DOWN MY RESISTANCE THROUGH ANOTHER BIT OF FEMININITY IN HIS HOUSEHOLD THE LITTLE NINE YEAR OLD PRINCESS LU YAN HIS DAUGHTER I THINK SAN LAN HELD SOMETHING OF REAL AFFECTION FOR THIS SPRIGHTLY LITTLE MITE
3483-119637-0031 WHO IN SPITE OF THE SICKENING KNOWLEDGE OF ROTTENNESS SHE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED AT THIS EARLY AGE WAS THE NEAREST THING TO INNOCENCE I FOUND IN LO TAN BUT HE DID NOT REALIZE THIS AND COULD NOT FOR EVEN THE MOST NATURAL AND FUNDAMENTAL AFFECTION OF THE HUMAN RACE
3483-119637-0032 THAT OF PARENTS FOR THEIR OFFSPRING HAD BEEN SO DEGRADED AND SUPPRESSED IN THIS VICIOUS HAN CIVILIZATION AS TO BE UNRECOGNIZABLE NATURALLY SAN LAN COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF MY PITY FOR THIS POOR CHILD
3483-119637-0033 BUT HAD HE DONE SO I TRULY BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN READY TO INFLICT DEGRADATION TORTURE AND EVEN DEATH UPON HER TO MAKE ME SURRENDER THE INFORMATION HE WANTED YET THIS MAN PERVERTED PRODUCT OF A MORALLY DEGRADED RACE
3483-119637-0034 SOMETHING OF SINCERITY IN A WARPED TWISTED WAY THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE SEEMED TO SENSE VAGUELY GROPINGLY WONDERINGLY THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A SOUL THE HAN PHILOSOPHY FOR CENTURIES HAD NOT ADMITTED THE EXISTENCE OF SOULS
3483-119637-0035 ITS CONCEPTION EMBRACED NOTHING BUT ELECTRONS PROTONS AND MOLECULES AND STILL WAS STRUGGLING DESPERATELY FOR SOME SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT THOUGHTS WILL POWER AND CONSCIOUSNESS OF SELF WERE NOTHING BUT CHEMICAL REACTIONS
3483-119637-0036 HOWEVER IT HAD GOTTEN NO FURTHER THAN THE NEGATIVE KNOWLEDGE WE HAD IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THAT A SICK BODY DULLS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MATERIAL WORLD AND THAT KNOWLEDGE WHICH ALL MANKIND HAS HAD FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME THAT A DEAD BODY
3483-119637-0037 THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN PRODUCING BY SYNTHESIS WHAT APPEARED TO BE LIVING TISSUES AND EVEN ANIMALS OF MODERATELY COMPLEX STRUCTURE AND RUDIMENTARY BRAINS BUT THEY COULD NOT GIVE THESE CREATURES THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF LIFE'S CHARACTERISTICS
3483-119637-0038 NOR RAISE THE BRAINS TO MORE THAN MECHANICAL CONTROL OF MUSCULAR TISSUES IT WAS MY OWN OPINION THAT THEY NEVER COULD SUCCEED IN DOING SO THIS OPINION IMPRESSED SAN LAN GREATLY I HAD EXPECTED HIM TO SNORT HIS DISGUST
3483-119637-0039 AS THE EXTREME SCHOOL OF EVOLUTIONISTS WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BUT THE IDEA WAS AS NEW TO HIM AND THE SCIENTISTS OF HIS COURT AS DARWINISM WAS TO THE LATE NINETEENTH AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURIES SO IT WAS RECEIVED WITH MUCH RESPECT
3483-119637-0040 PAINFULLY AND WITH ENFORCED MENTAL READJUSTMENTS THEY BEGAN A PHILOSOPHICAL SEARCH FOR EXCUSES AND JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE IDEA
3483-119637-0041 FOR OF COURSE NEITHER THE NEWNESS NOR THE ORTHODOXY OF A HYPOTHESIS WILL MAKE IT TRUE IF IT IS NOT TRUE NOR UNTRUE IF IT IS TRUE NOR COULD THE LUCK OR WILL POWER WITH WHICH I HAD RESISTED THEIR HYPNOTISTS AND PSYCHOANALYSTS
3483-119637-0042 MAKE WHAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE A UNIVERSAL FACT ONE WHIT MORE OR LESS OF A FACT THAN IT REALLY WAS
3483-119637-0043 AND THE NOVELTY OF MY EXPRESSED OPINION CARRIED MUCH WEIGHT WITH THEM YET DID NOT EVEN BRILLIANT SCIENTISTS FREQUENTLY EXHIBIT THE SAME LACK OF LOGIC BACK IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY DID NOT THE HISTORIANS THE PHILOSOPHERS OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ROME
3483-119637-0044 SHOW THEMSELVES TO BE THE SAME SHREWD OBSERVERS AS THOSE OF SUCCEEDING CENTURIES THE SAME MASTERS OF THE LOGICAL AND SLAVES OF THE ILLOGICAL AFTER ALL I REFLECTED MAN MAKES LITTLE PROGRESS WITHIN HIMSELF
3483-119637-0045 THROUGH SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS HE PILES UP THOSE RESOURCES WHICH HE POSSESSES OUTSIDE OF HIMSELF THE TOOLS OF HIS HANDS AND THE WAREHOUSES OF KNOWLEDGE FOR HIS BRAIN WHETHER THEY BE PARCHMENT MANUSCRIPTS PRINTED BOOK OR ELECTRONORECORDOGRAPHS
3483-119637-0046 FOR THE REST HE IS BORN TODAY AS IN ANCIENT GREECE WITH A BLANK BRAIN AND STRUGGLES THROUGH TO HIS GRAVE WITH A MORE OR LESS BECLOUDED UNDERSTANDING AND WITH DISTINCT LIMITATIONS TO WHAT WE USED TO CALL HIS THINK TANK
3483-119637-0047 THIS PARTICULAR REFLECTION OF MINE PROVED UNPOPULAR WITH THEM FOR IT STABBED THEIR VANITY AND NEITHER MY PRESTIGE NOR THE NOVELTY OF THE IDEA WAS SUFFICIENT SALVE THESE HANS FOR CENTURIES HAD BELIEVED AND TAUGHT THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY WERE A SUPER RACE
3483-119637-0048 A RACE OF DESTINY DESTINED TO WHOM FOR WHAT WAS NOT SO CLEAR TO THEM BUT NEVERTHELESS DESTINED TO ELEVATE HUMANITY TO SOME SORT OF SUPER PLANE
