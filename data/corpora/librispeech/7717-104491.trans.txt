7717-104491-0000 THE CARROLL FAMILY AUNT CARROLL IS COMING TO DINNER TO DAY SAID DOLLY THE NEXT DAY WITH A SERIOUS FACE I KNOW SHE IS HAVE A NICE DINNER FOR HER I DON'T THINK SHE EVER HAS A NICE DINNER AT HOME
7717-104491-0001 AND THE THREE ELDEST GIRLS ARE COMING THREE YOU ASKED THEM YOURSELF ON SUNDAY VERY WELL THEY SAID THEIR PAPA WOULD BE AWAY ON BUSINESS IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT MISTER CARROLL WAS NEVER ASKED TO THE MANOR HOUSE
7717-104491-0002 BUSINESS THERE IS A CLUB HE BELONGS TO WHERE HE DINES AND GETS DRUNK ONCE A MONTH IT'S THE ONLY THING HE DOES REGULARLY THEY MUST HAVE THEIR DINNER AT ANY RATE SAID MISTER GREY
7717-104491-0003 THIS HAD BEEN A SUBJECT MUCH DISCUSSED BETWEEN THEM BUT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION MISS GREY WOULD NOT RENEW IT SHE DESPATCHED HER FATHER IN A CAB THE CAB HAVING BEEN PROCURED BECAUSE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATE AND THEN WENT TO WORK TO ORDER HER DINNER
7717-104491-0004 IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT MISS GREY HATED THE CARROLLS BUT SHE HATED THE DAUGHTERS WORSE THAN THE MOTHER AND OF ALL THE PEOPLE SHE HATED IN THE WORLD SHE HATED AMELIA CARROLL THE WORST AMELIA THE ELDEST
7717-104491-0005 ENTERTAINED AN IDEA THAT SHE WAS MORE OF A PERSONAGE IN THE WORLD'S EYES THAN HER COUSIN THAT SHE WENT TO MORE PARTIES WHICH CERTAINLY WAS TRUE IF SHE WENT TO ANY THAT SHE WORE FINER CLOTHES WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE AND THAT SHE HAD A LOVER
7717-104491-0006 WHEREAS DOLLY GREY AS SHE CALLED HER COUSIN BEHIND HER BACK HAD NONE THIS LOVER HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HORSES AND HAD ONLY BEEN HEARD OF HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN AT THE MANOR HOUSE
7717-104491-0007 SOPHY WAS A GOOD DEAL HATED ALSO BEING A FORWARD FLIRTING TRICKY GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHO HAD JUST LEFT THE SCHOOL AT WHICH UNCLE JOHN HAD PAID FOR HER EDUCATION GEORGINA THE THIRD WAS STILL AT SCHOOL UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
7717-104491-0008 BETSEY HAD TO PREPARE THE DINNER TABLE DOWN STAIRS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SADLY DISCOMFITED HAD SHE BEEN DRIVEN TO DO IT IN THE PRESENCE OF THREE CARROLL GIRLS
7717-104491-0009 WELL AUNT CARROLL HOW DOES THE WORLD USE YOU VERY BADLY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN UP TO SEE ME FOR TEN DAYS I HAVEN'T COUNTED BUT WHEN I DO COME I DON'T OFTEN DO ANY GOOD HOW ARE MINNA AND BRENDA AND POTSEY
7717-104491-0010 WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HER FATHER'S PET I HOPE HIS STATE OF HEALTH WILL NOT DEBAR HIM FROM DINING WITH HIS FRIENDS TO NIGHT SAID MISS GREY
7717-104491-0011 NOTHING WILL EVER KEEP HIM BACK WHEN CONVIVIALITY DEMANDS HIS PRESENCE THIS CAME FROM HIS AFFLICTED WIFE WHO IN SPITE OF ALL HIS MISFORTUNES WOULD EVER SPEAK WITH SOME RESPECT OF HER HUSBAND'S EMPLOYMENTS
7717-104491-0012 HE WASN'T AT ALL IN A FIT STATE TO GO TO NIGHT BUT HE HAD PROMISED AND THAT WAS ENOUGH WHEN THEY HAD WAITED THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR AMELIA BEGAN TO COMPLAIN CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT REASON
7717-104491-0013 PAPA HAS UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS TIME WHICH IS NOT ALTOGETHER HIS OWN THERE WAS NOT MUCH IN THESE WORDS BUT THE TONE IN WHICH THEY WERE UTTERED WOULD HAVE CRUSHED ANY ONE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THAN AMELIA CARROLL
7717-104491-0014 BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE CAB ARRIVED AND DOLLY WENT DOWN TO MEET HER FATHER HAVE THEY COME HE ASKED COME SHE ANSWERED TAKING HIS GLOVES AND COMFORTER FROM HIM AND GIVING HIM A KISS AS SHE DID SO THAT GIRL UP STAIRS IS NEARLY FAMISHED
7717-104491-0015 I WON'T BE HALF A MOMENT SAID THE REPENTANT FATHER HASTENING UP STAIRS TO GO THROUGH HIS ORDINARY DRESSING ARRANGEMENT I WOULDN'T HURRY FOR HER SAID DOLLY BUT OF COURSE YOU'LL HURRY YOU ALWAYS DO DON'T YOU PAPA THEN THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER
7717-104491-0016 WELL GIRLS WHAT IS YOUR NEWS WE WERE OUT TO DAY ON THE BROMPTON ROAD SAID THE ELDEST AND THERE CAME UP PRINCE CHITAKOV'S DRAG WITH FOUR ROANS PRINCE CHITAKOV I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A PRINCE
7717-104491-0017 OH DEAR YES WITH VERY STIFF MUSTACHES TURNED UP HIGH AT THE CORNERS AND PINK CHEEKS AND A VERY SHARP NOBBY LOOKING HAT WITH A LIGHT COLORED GREY COAT AND LIGHT GLOVES YOU MUST KNOW THE PRINCE UPON MY WORD I NEVER HEARD OF HIM MY DEAR
7717-104491-0018 HE WAS TOOLING HIS OWN DRAG
7717-104491-0019 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING MORE TASTY THAN HER DRESS
7717-104491-0020 CAN EITHER OF YOU TELL ME WHAT THE WIFE OF A PRINCE OF CHITAKOV WOULD CALL HERSELF PRINCESS OF CHITAKOV OF COURSE SAID SOPHY IT'S THE PRINCESS OF WALES BUT IT ISN'T THE PRINCESS OF CHRISTIAN NOR YET THE PRINCESS OF TECK NOR THE PRINCESS OF ENGLAND
7717-104491-0021 I DON'T SEE WHY THE LADY SHOULDN'T BE MISSUS CHITAKOV IF THERE IS SUCH A LADY PAPA DON'T BAMBOOZLE HER SAID HIS DAUGHTER BUT CONTINUED THE ATTORNEY WHY SHOULDN'T THE LADY HAVE BEEN HIS WIFE DON'T MARRIED LADIES WEAR LITTLE FLUFFY FUR ORNAMENTS
7717-104491-0022 HE DID SAID SOPHY IT'S THE MOST IMPERTINENT THING I EVER HEARD IF MY FATHER HAD SEEN IT HE'D HAVE HAD THE PRINCE OFF THE BOX OF THE COACH IN NO TIME
7717-104491-0023 POOR DOLLY DURING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PRINCE SAT ANGRY AND SILENT THINKING TO HERSELF IN DESPAIR OF WHAT EXTREMES OF VULGARITY EVEN A FIRST COUSIN OF HER OWN COULD BE GUILTY THAT SHE SHOULD BE SITTING AT TABLE WITH A GIRL
7717-104491-0024 WHO COULD BOAST THAT A REPROBATE FOREIGNER HAD KISSED HIS HAND TO HER FROM THE BOX OF A FASHIONABLE FOUR HORSED COACH FOR IT WAS IN THAT LIGHT THAT MISS GREY REGARDED IT AND DID YOU HAVE ANY FARTHER ADVENTURES BESIDES THIS MEMORABLE ENCOUNTER WITH THE PRINCE
7717-104491-0025 NOTHING NEARLY SO INTERESTING SAID SOPHY THAT WAS HARDLY TO BE EXPECTED SAID THE ATTORNEY JANE YOU WILL HAVE A GLASS OF PORT WINE GIRLS YOU MUST HAVE A GLASS OF PORT WINE TO SUPPORT YOU AFTER YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE PRINCE
7717-104491-0026 WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE LEAST SAID AMELIA PRAY PRAY LET THE SUBJECT DROP SAID DOLLY THAT IS BECAUSE THE PRINCE DID NOT KISS HIS HAND TO YOU SAID SOPHY THEN MISS GREY SUNK AGAIN INTO SILENCE CRUSHED BENEATH THIS LAST BLOW
7717-104491-0027 IN THE EVENING WHEN THE DINNER THINGS HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY A MATTER OF BUSINESS CAME UP AND TOOK THE PLACE OF THE PRINCE AND HIS MUSTACHES MISSUS CARROLL WAS MOST ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER HER BROTHER COULD LEND HER A SMALL SUM OF TWENTY POUNDS
7717-104491-0028 HE DOESN'T HAVE MANY BUT HE MUST HAVE SOME THERE HAD BEEN OTHER APPEALS ON THE SAME SUBJECT MADE NOT VERY LONG SINCE AND TO TELL THE TRUTH MISTER GREY DID REQUIRE TO HAVE THE SUBJECT ARGUED
7717-104491-0029 IN FEAR OF THE SUBSEQUENT REMARKS WHICH WOULD BE MADE TO HIM AFTERWARD BY HIS DAUGHTER IF HE GAVE THE MONEY TOO EASILY
7717-104491-0030 BUT THE ONE AUDITOR WHOM SHE FEARED WAS HER NIECE ON THE PRESENT OCCASION MISS GREY SIMPLY TOOK UP HER BOOK TO SHOW THAT THE SUBJECT WAS ONE WHICH HAD NO INTEREST FOR HER BUT SHE DID UNDOUBTEDLY LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS SAID ON THE SUBJECT
7717-104491-0031 THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING SETTLED ABOUT POOR PATRICK'S CLOTHES SAID MISSUS CARROLL IN A HALF WHISPER SHE DID NOT CARE HOW MUCH HER OWN CHILDREN HEARD
7717-104491-0032 I DARE SAY SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE AT SOME TIME SAID MISTER GREY WHO KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE TOLD WHEN THE EVENING WAS OVER THAT HE WOULD GIVE AWAY ALL HIS SUBSTANCE TO THAT MAN IF HE WERE ASKED
7717-104491-0033 PAPA HAS NOT HAD A NEW PAIR OF TROUSERS THIS YEAR SAID SOPHY EXCEPT THOSE GREEN ONES HE WORE AT THE RACES SAID GEORGINA HOLD YOUR TONGUE MISS SAID HER MOTHER THAT WAS A PAIR I MADE UP FOR HIM AND SENT THEM TO THE MAN TO GET PRESSED
7717-104491-0034 WHEN THE HUNDRED A YEAR WAS ARRANGED FOR ALL OUR DRESSES SAID AMELIA NOT A WORD WAS SAID ABOUT PAPA OF COURSE PAPA IS A TROUBLE I DON'T SEE THAT HE IS MORE OF A TROUBLE THAN ANY ONE ELSE SAID SOPHY UNCLE JOHN WOULD NOT LIKE NOT TO HAVE ANY CLOTHES
7717-104491-0035 NO I SHOULD NOT MY DEAR AND HIS OWN INCOME IS ALL GIVEN UP TO THE HOUSE USES HERE SOPHY TOUCHED IMPRUDENTLY ON A SORE SUBJECT HIS OWN INCOME CONSISTED OF WHAT HAD BEEN SAVED OUT OF HIS WIFE'S FORTUNE
7717-104491-0036 AND WAS THUS NAMED AS IN OPPOSITION TO THE LARGER SUM PAID TO MISSUS CARROLL BY MISTER GREY THERE WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR COMING FROM SETTLED PROPERTY WHICH HAD BEEN PRESERVED BY THE LAWYER'S CARE AND WHICH WAS REGARDED IN THE FAMILY AS PAPA'S OWN
7717-104491-0037 IT CERTAINLY IS ESSENTIAL FOR RESPECTABILITY THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE SET APART FROM A MAN'S INCOME FOR HIS WEARING APPAREL AND THOUGH THE MONEY WAS PERHAPS IMPROPERLY SO DESIGNATED
7717-104491-0038 IN COMPANY WITH THE GREEN TROUSERS SHE HAD HER OWN MEANS OF OBTAINING INFORMATION AS TO THE CARROLL FAMILY IT WAS VERY NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD DO SO IF THE FAMILY WAS TO BE KEPT ON ITS LEGS AT ALL
7717-104491-0039 I DON'T THINK ANY GOOD CAN COME FROM DISCUSSING WHAT MY UNCLE DOES WITH THE MONEY THIS WAS DOLLY'S FIRST SPEECH IF HE IS TO HAVE IT LET HIM HAVE IT BUT LET HIM HAVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
7717-104491-0040 YOUR COUSIN DOROTHY IS VERY FORTUNATE SAID MISSUS CARROLL SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT FOR ANYTHING SHE NEVER SPENDS ANYTHING ON HERSELF SAID HER FATHER IT IS DOLLY'S ONLY FAULT THAT SHE WON'T BECAUSE SHE HAS IT ALL DONE FOR HER SAID AMELIA
7717-104491-0041 DOLLY HAD GONE BACK TO HER BOOK AND DISDAINED TO MAKE ANY FARTHER REPLY HER FATHER FELT THAT QUITE ENOUGH HAD BEEN SAID ABOUT IT AND WAS PREPARED TO GIVE THE TWENTY POUNDS UNDER THE IDEA
7717-104491-0042 HE DOES WANT THEM VERY BADLY FOR DECENCY'S SAKE SAID THE POOR WIFE THUS WINDING UP HER PLEA THEN MISTER GREY GOT OUT HIS CHECK BOOK AND WROTE THE CHECK FOR TWENTY POUNDS BUT HE MADE IT PAYABLE NOT TO MISTER BUT TO MISSUS CARROLL
7717-104491-0043 I SUPPOSE PAPA NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT MISTER CARROLL THIS WAS SAID BY DOLLY AS SOON AS THE FAMILY HAD WITHDRAWN IN WHAT WAY DONE MY DEAR AS TO SETTLING SOME FARTHER SUM FOR HIMSELF HE'D ONLY SPEND IT MY DEAR
7717-104491-0044 THAT WOULD BE INTENDED SAID DOLLY AND THEN HE WOULD COME BACK JUST THE SAME BUT IN THAT CASE HE SHOULD HAVE NOTHING MORE THOUGH THEY WERE TO DECLARE THAT HE HADN'T A PAIR OF TROUSERS IN WHICH TO APPEAR AT A RACE COURSE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE IT MY DEAR SAID MISTER GREY
7717-104491-0045 YOU NEEDN'T TELL HIM BUT SO IT MUST BE IF I HAD MY WAY SAID DOLLY AFTER TEN MINUTES SILENCE I WOULD PUNISH HIM
7717-104491-0046 IT IS NOT THAT I WISH TO AVOID MY SHARE OF THE WORLD'S BURDENS BUT THAT JUSTICE SHOULD BE DONE I DON'T KNOW WHICH I HATE THE WORST UNCLE CARROLL OR MISTER SCARBOROUGH
7717-104491-0047 THE NEXT DAY WAS SUNDAY AND DOLLY WAS VERY ANXIOUS BEFORE BREAKFAST TO INDUCE HER FATHER TO SAY THAT HE WOULD GO TO CHURCH WITH HER BUT HE WAS INCLINED TO BE OBSTINATE AND FELL BACK UPON HIS USUAL EXCUSE
7717-104491-0048 SAYING THAT THERE WERE SCARBOROUGH PAPERS WHICH IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD READ BEFORE HE STARTED FOR TRETTON ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
7717-104491-0049 WELL YES I SUPPOSE IT WOULD THAT IS THE INTENTION BUT SOMEHOW IT FAILS WITH ME SOMETIMES DO YOU THINK THAT YOU HATE PEOPLE WHEN YOU GO TO CHURCH AS MUCH AS WHEN YOU DON'T I AM NOT SURE THAT I HATE ANYBODY VERY MUCH I DO THAT
7717-104491-0050 BUT IF YOU DON'T HATE THEM IT IS BECAUSE YOU WON'T TAKE THE TROUBLE AND THAT AGAIN IS NOT RIGHT IF YOU WOULD COME TO CHURCH YOU WOULD BE BETTER FOR IT ALL ROUND YOU'D HATE UNCLE CARROLL'S IDLENESS AND ABOMINABLE SELF INDULGENCE WORSE THAN YOU DO
7717-104491-0051 I KNOW YOU WOULD YOU DEAR SWEET KIND HEARTED BUT MOST UN CHRISTIAN FATHER YOU MUST COME TO CHURCH IN ORDER THAT SOME IDEA OF WHAT CHRISTIANITY DEMANDS OF YOU MAY MAKE ITS WAY INTO YOUR HEART
7717-104491-0052 IT IS NOT WHAT THE CLERGYMAN MAY SAY OF YOU BUT THAT YOUR MIND WILL GET AWAY FOR TWO HOURS FROM THAT OTHER REPTILE AND HIS CONCERNS THEN MISTER GREY WITH A LOUD LONG SIGH
7717-104491-0053 ALLOWED HIS BOOTS AND HIS GLOVES AND HIS CHURCH GOING HAT AND HIS CHURCH GOING UMBRELLA TO BE BROUGHT TO HIM IT WAS IN FACT HIS AVERSION TO THESE ARTICLES THAT DOLLY HAD TO ENCOUNTER IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER THE CHURCH SERVICES OF THAT DAY DID MISTER GREY MUCH GOOD
7717-104491-0054 BUT THEY SEEMED TO HAVE HAD SOME EFFECT UPON HIS DAUGHTER FROM THE FACT THAT IN THE AFTERNOON SHE WROTE A LETTER IN KINDLY WORDS TO HER AUNT PAPA IS GOING TO TRETTON AND I WILL COME UP TO YOU ON TUESDAY I HAVE GOT A FROCK WHICH I WILL BRING WITH ME AS A PRESENT FOR POTSEY
7717-104491-0055 AND I WILL MAKE HER SEW ON THE BUTTONS FOR HERSELF TELL MINNA I WILL LEND HER THAT BOOK I SPOKE OF ABOUT THOSE BOOTS I WILL GO WITH GEORGINA TO THE BOOT MAKER BUT AS TO AMELIA AND SOPHY SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SAY A GOOD NATURED WORD
7717-104491-0056 SO DEEP IN HER HEART HAD SUNK THAT SIN OF WHICH THEY HAD BEEN GUILTY WITH REFERENCE TO PRINCE CHITAKOV ON THAT NIGHT SHE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION WITH HER FATHER RESPECTING THE AFFAIRS OF THE SCARBOROUGH FAMILY THE DISCUSSION WAS HELD IN THE DINING ROOM AND MAY THEREFORE
7717-104491-0057 THOSE AT NIGHT IN MISTER GREY'S OWN BEDROOM WERE GENERALLY THE RESULT OF SUDDEN THOUGHT I SHOULD LAY DOWN THE LAW TO HIM BEGAN DOLLY THE LAW IS THE LAW SAID HER FATHER I DON'T MEAN THE LAW IN THAT SENSE I SHOULD TELL HIM FIRMLY WHAT I ADVISED
7717-104491-0058 AND SHOULD THEN MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT IF HE DID NOT FOLLOW MY ADVICE I MUST WITHDRAW IF HIS SON IS WILLING TO PAY THESE MONEY LENDERS WHAT SUMS THEY HAVE ACTUALLY ADVANCED AND IF BY ANY EFFORT ON HIS PART THE MONEY CAN BE RAISED LET IT BE DONE
7717-104491-0059 THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME JUSTICE IN REPAYING OUT OF THE PROPERTY THAT WHICH WAS LENT TO THE PROPERTY WHEN BY MISTER SCARBOROUGH'S OWN DOING THE PROPERTY WAS SUPPOSED TO GO INTO THE ELDEST SON'S HANDS THOUGH THE ELDEST SON AND THE MONEY LENDERS BE SPENDTHRIFTS AND PROFLIGATES ALIKE
7717-104491-0060 GO THERE PREPARED WITH YOUR OPINION BUT IF EITHER FATHER OR SON WILL NOT ACCEPT IT THEN DEPART AND SHAKE THE DUST FROM YOUR FEET YOU PROPOSE IT ALL AS THOUGH IT WERE THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD
7717-104491-0061 EASY OR DIFFICULT I WOULD NOT DISCUSS ANYTHING OF WHICH THE JUSTICE MAY HEREAFTER BE DISPUTED
