362-123048-0000 MY NEW MASTER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HE HAD BLACK EYES AND A HOOKED NOSE HIS MOUTH WAS AS FULL OF TEETH AS A BULL DOG'S AND HIS VOICE WAS AS HARSH AS THE GRINDING OF CART WHEELS
362-123048-0001 BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT FEELING IS BELIEVING
362-123048-0002 I NEVER KNEW TILL NOW THE UTTER MISERY OF A CAB HORSE'S LIFE SKINNER HAD A LOW SET OF CABS AND A LOW SET OF DRIVERS HE WAS HARD ON THE MEN AND THE MEN
362-123048-0003 WERE HARD ON THE HORSES IN THIS PLACE WE HAD NO SUNDAY REST
362-123048-0004 SOMETIMES ON A SUNDAY MORNING A PARTY OF FAST MEN WOULD HIRE THE CAB FOR THE DAY FOUR OF THEM INSIDE AND ANOTHER WITH THE DRIVER AND I HAD TO TAKE THEM TEN OR FIFTEEN MILES OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AND BACK AGAIN
362-123048-0005 LET IT BE EVER SO STEEP OR THE DAY EVER SO HOT UNLESS INDEED WHEN THE DRIVER WAS AFRAID I SHOULD NOT MANAGE IT AND SOMETIMES I WAS SO FEVERED AND WORN
362-123048-0006 THAT I COULD HARDLY TOUCH MY FOOD HOW I USED TO LONG FOR THE NICE BRAN MASH WITH NITER IN IT THAT JERRY USED TO GIVE US ON SATURDAY NIGHTS IN HOT WEATHER
362-123048-0007 THAT USED TO COOL US DOWN AND MAKE US SO COMFORTABLE THEN WE HAD TWO NIGHTS AND A WHOLE DAY FOR UNBROKEN REST AND ON MONDAY MORNING WE WERE AS FRESH AS YOUNG HORSES AGAIN
362-123048-0008 BUT HERE THERE WAS NO REST AND MY DRIVER WAS JUST AS HARD AS HIS MASTER HE HAD A CRUEL WHIP WITH SOMETHING SO SHARP AT THE END THAT IT SOMETIMES DREW BLOOD
362-123048-0009 AND HE WOULD EVEN WHIP ME UNDER THE BELLY AND FLIP THE LASH OUT AT MY HEAD INDIGNITIES LIKE THESE TOOK THE HEART OUT OF ME TERRIBLY BUT STILL I DID MY BEST
362-123048-0010 AND NEVER HUNG BACK FOR AS POOR GINGER SAID IT WAS NO USE
362-123048-0011 SO MY DRIVER PULLED UP AT THE BACK OF SOME OF THE OUTSIDE CABS TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF A RETURN FARE IT WAS A VERY HEAVY TRAIN AND AS ALL THE CABS WERE SOON ENGAGED OURS WAS CALLED FOR
362-123048-0012 THERE WAS A PARTY OF FOUR A NOISY BLUSTERING MAN WITH A LADY
362-123048-0013 OH HE'S ALL RIGHT MISS SAID MY DRIVER HE'S STRONG ENOUGH THE PORTER WHO WAS PULLING ABOUT SOME HEAVY BOXES SUGGESTED TO THE GENTLEMAN AS THERE WAS SO MUCH LUGGAGE
362-123048-0014 CAN YOUR HORSE DO IT OR CAN'T HE SAID THE BLUSTERING MAN
362-123048-0015 HE COULD TAKE MORE THAN THAT AND HE HELPED TO HAUL UP A BOX SO HEAVY
362-123048-0016 A PRETTY THING IT WOULD BE IF A MAN OF BUSINESS HAD TO EXAMINE EVERY CAB HORSE BEFORE HE HIRED IT THE MAN KNOWS HIS OWN BUSINESS OF COURSE THERE GET IN AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE MY GENTLE FRIEND HAD TO OBEY
362-123048-0017 AND BOX AFTER BOX WAS DRAGGED UP AND LODGED ON THE TOP OF THE CAB OR SETTLED BY THE SIDE OF THE DRIVER AT LAST ALL WAS READY AND WITH HIS USUAL JERK AT THE REIN AND SLASH OF THE WHIP
362-123048-0018 HE DROVE OUT OF THE STATION THE LOAD WAS VERY HEAVY AND I HAD HAD NEITHER FOOD NOR REST SINCE MORNING
362-123048-0019 I WAS STRUGGLING TO KEEP ON GOADED BY CONSTANT CHUCKS OF THE REIN AND USE OF THE WHIP WHEN IN A SINGLE MOMENT I CANNOT TELL HOW
362-123048-0020 NOW I WAS GOING TO DIE I HEARD A SORT OF CONFUSION ROUND ME LOUD ANGRY VOICES AND THE GETTING DOWN OF THE LUGGAGE BUT IT WAS ALL LIKE A DREAM I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT SWEET PITIFUL VOICE SAYING
362-123048-0021 SOME ONE CAME AND LOOSENED THE THROAT STRAP OF MY BRIDLE AND UNDID THE TRACES WHICH KEPT THE COLLAR SO TIGHT UPON ME SOME ONE SAID HE'S DEAD HE'LL NEVER GET UP AGAIN THEN
362-123048-0022 I COULD HEAR A POLICEMAN GIVING ORDERS BUT I DID NOT EVEN OPEN MY EYES I COULD ONLY DRAW A GASPING BREATH NOW AND THEN SOME COLD WATER WAS THROWN OVER MY HEAD
362-123048-0023 AND SOME CORDIAL WAS POURED INTO MY MOUTH AND SOMETHING WAS COVERED OVER ME I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG I LAY THERE BUT I FOUND MY LIFE COMING BACK AND A KIND VOICED MAN WAS PATTING ME
362-123048-0024 AND ENCOURAGING ME TO RISE AFTER SOME MORE CORDIAL HAD BEEN GIVEN ME AND AFTER ONE OR TWO ATTEMPTS I STAGGERED TO MY FEET AND WAS GENTLY LED TO SOME STABLES WHICH WERE CLOSE BY
362-123048-0025 HERE I WAS PUT INTO A WELL LITTERED STALL AND SOME WARM GRUEL WAS BROUGHT TO ME WHICH I DRANK THANKFULLY IN THE EVENING
362-123048-0026 I WAS SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED TO BE LED BACK TO SKINNER'S STABLES WHERE I THINK THEY DID THE BEST FOR ME THEY COULD IN THE MORNING SKINNER CAME WITH A FARRIER TO LOOK AT ME HE EXAMINED ME VERY CLOSELY AND SAID
362-123048-0027 THIS IS A CASE OF OVERWORK MORE THAN DISEASE
362-123048-0028 BUT NOW THERE IS NOT AN OUNCE OF STRENGTH LEFT IN HIM
362-123048-0029 I HAVE NO MEADOWS TO NURSE SICK HORSES IN HE MIGHT GET WELL OR HE MIGHT NOT THAT SORT OF THING DON'T SUIT MY BUSINESS MY PLAN IS TO WORK EM AS LONG AS THEY'LL GO AND THEN SELL EM FOR WHAT THEY'LL FETCH
362-123048-0030 AT THE KNACKER'S OR ELSEWHERE
362-123048-0031 YOU HAD BETTER HAVE HIM KILLED OUT OF HAND BUT HE IS NOT THERE IS A SALE OF HORSES COMING OFF IN ABOUT TEN DAYS IF YOU REST HIM AND FEED HIM UP HE MAY PICK UP AND YOU MAY GET MORE THAN HIS SKIN IS WORTH AT ANY RATE
362-123048-0032 UPON THIS ADVICE SKINNER RATHER UNWILLINGLY I THINK GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD BE WELL FED AND CARED FOR AND THE STABLE MAN HAPPILY FOR ME CARRIED OUT THE ORDERS
362-123048-0033 TEN DAYS OF PERFECT REST PLENTY OF GOOD OATS HAY BRAN MASHES WITH BOILED LINSEED MIXED IN THEM DID MORE TO GET UP MY CONDITION THAN ANYTHING ELSE COULD HAVE DONE
362-123048-0034 THOSE LINSEED MASHES WERE DELICIOUS AND I BEGAN TO THINK AFTER ALL
