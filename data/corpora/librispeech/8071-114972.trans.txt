8071-114972-0000 NEVER DID WINDOW OPEN UPON A SCENE OF SUCH ENCHANTMENT NEVER HAS THE DAWN RISEN OVER SO FAIR A LAND MEADOWS SO FRESH AND GRASS SO GREEN RIVERS OF SUCH MYSTIC SILVER AND FAR MOUNTAINS
8071-114972-0001 YET STRANGELY ENOUGH IT WAS NOT UPON THIS MIRACLE THAT THE EYES OF THE PRINCESS WERE GAZING IN FACT SHE SEEMED ENTIRELY OBLIVIOUS OF IT ALL OBLIVIOUS OF ALL THAT WAS PASSING IN THE SKY
8071-114972-0002 A STRANGER MARVEL
8071-114972-0003 ONLY CARE WAS TO GAZE ALL DAY AT HER OWN FACE AND INDEED IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL FACE THAT SHE SAW THERE SO BEAUTIFUL THAT THE PRINCESS MIGHT WELL BE PARDONED
8071-114972-0004 I AM MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE HAD LOOKED AT THE MORNING STAR AND THEN SHE HAD LOOKED IN HER MIRROR AND SAID
8071-114972-0005 SHE HAD LOOKED AT THE RISING MOON AND THEN SHE HAD LOOKED IN HER MIRROR AND STILL SHE SAID I AM MORE BEAUTIFUL WHENEVER SHE HEARD OF A BEAUTIFUL FACE IN HER KINGDOM
8071-114972-0006 SHE CAUSED IT TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HER AND THEN SHE LOOKED IN HER MIRROR AND ALWAYS SHE SMILED TO HERSELF AND SAID I AM MORE BEAUTIFUL
8071-114972-0007 THAT SHE HATED EVEN TO SLEEP BUT NOT EVEN IN SLEEP DID SHE LOSE THE BEAUTIFUL FACE SHE LOVED FOR IT WAS STILL THERE IN THE MIRROR OF DREAMS YET OFTEN SHE WOULD WAKE IN THE NIGHT TO GAZE AT IT AND ALWAYS
8071-114972-0008 SHE AROSE AT DAWN THAT WITH THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SHE MIGHT LOOK INTO HER MIRROR
8071-114972-0009 SHE WOULD SIT AT HER WINDOW AND NEVER TAKE HER EYES FROM THOSE BEAUTIFUL EYES THAT LOOKED BACK AT HER AND THE LONGEST DAY IN THE YEAR WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO RETURN THEIR GAZE
8071-114972-0010 THIS PARTICULAR MORNING WAS A MORNING IN MAY ALL BLOOM AND SONG AND CROWDING LEAVES AND THICKENING GRASS THE VALLEY WAS A MIST OF BLOSSOM
8071-114972-0011 AND THE AIR THRILLED WITH THE WARBLING OF INNUMERABLE BIRDS SOFT DEWY SCENTS FLOATED HITHER AND THITHER ON THE WANDERING BREEZE BUT THE PRINCESS TOOK NO NOTE OF THESE THINGS
8071-114972-0012 LOST IN THE DREAM OF HER FACE AND SAW THE CHANGES OF THE DAWN ONLY AS THEY WERE REFLECTED IN HER MIRROR AND SUFFUSED HER BEAUTY WITH THEIR RAINBOW TINTS
8071-114972-0013 AND BROKE INTO SUDDEN SONG SHE WAS SO STARTLED THAT THE MIRROR SLIPPED FROM HER HAND NOW THE PRINCESS'S WINDOW WAS IN THE WALL OF AN OLD CASTLE BUILT HIGH ABOVE THE VALLEY
8071-114972-0014 AND BENEATH IT THE GROUND SLOPED PRECIPITATELY COVERED WITH UNDERBRUSH AND THICK GRASSES TO A HIGHROAD WINDING FAR BENEATH AS THE MIRROR SLIPPED FROM THE HAND OF THE PRINCESS IT FELL AMONG THIS UNDERBRUSH AND ROLLED GLITTERING
8071-114972-0015 TILL THE PRINCESS FINALLY LOST SIGHT OF IT IN A BELT OF WILD FLOWERS OVERHANGING THE HIGHROAD AS IT FINALLY DISAPPEARED SHE SCREAMED SO LOUDLY THAT THE LADIES IN WAITING RAN TO HER IN ALARM
8071-114972-0016 AND SERVANTS WERE INSTANTLY SENT FORTH TO SEARCH FOR THE LOST MIRROR IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MIRROR THE WORK OF A GOLDSMITH FAMOUS FOR HIS FANTASTIC MASTERPIECES IN THE PRECIOUS METALS
8071-114972-0017 THE FANCY HE HAD SKILFULLY EMBODIED WAS THAT OF BEAUTY AS THE CANDLE ATTRACTING THE MOTHS THE HANDLE OF THE MIRROR WHICH WAS OF IVORY REPRESENTED THE CANDLE
8071-114972-0018 WROUGHT HERE AND THERE ON THE GOLDEN BACK OF THE MIRROR WERE MOTHS WITH WINGS OF ENAMEL AND PRECIOUS STONES IT WAS A MARVEL OF THE GOLDSMITH'S ART AND AS SUCH WAS BEYOND PRICE
8071-114972-0019 YET IT WAS NOT MERELY FOR THIS AS WE KNOW THAT THE PRINCESS LOVED IT BUT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO LONG THE INTIMATE OF HER BEAUTY FOR THIS REASON IT HAD BECOME SACRED IN HER EYES
8071-114972-0020 AND AS SHE WATCHED IT ROLL DOWN THE HILLSIDE
8071-114972-0021 AND WHEN THE MEN RETURNED FROM THEIR SEARCHING WITHOUT THE MIRROR SHE GAVE ORDERS TO HAVE THEM SOUNDLY FLOGGED FOR THEIR FAILURE MEANWHILE THE MIRROR RESTED PEACEFULLY AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS
8071-114972-0022 AND THE HUMMING OF BEES A SHORT WHILE AFTER THE SERVING MEN HAD BEEN FLOGGED AND THE TIRING MAIDS HAD BEEN BEATEN THERE CAME ALONG THE WHITE ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE CASTLE A TIRED MINSTREL
8071-114972-0023 HE HAD EVEN GROWN WEARY OF HIS OWN SONGS HE SAT DEJECTED AMID THE GREEN GRASSES AND LOOKED UP AT THE ANCIENT HEAVEN AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THEN SUDDENLY
8071-114972-0024 HE PLAYED ONE OF HIS OLD SONGS OF WHICH HE WAS HEARTILY WEARY AND AS HE PLAYED THE BUTTERFLIES FLITTED ABOUT HIM AND FILLED HIS OLD HAIR WITH BLUE WINGS HE WAS FORTY YEARS OLD AND VERY WEARY
8071-114972-0025 HE WAS ALONE HIS LAST NIGHTINGALE HAD CEASED SINGING THE TIME HAD COME FOR HIM WHEN ONE THINKS AND EVEN DREAMS OF THE FIRESIDE THE HEARTH AND THE BEAUTIFUL OLD MEMORIES
8071-114972-0026 HE HAD IN SHORT ARRIVED AT THAT PERIOD OF LIFE WHEN ONE BEGINS TO PERCEIVE THE BEAUTY OF MONEY AS A BOY HE HAD NEVER GIVEN A THOUGHT TO GOLD OR SILVER A BUTTERFLY HAD SEEMED MORE VALUABLE TO HIM THAN A GOLD PIECE
8071-114972-0027 THE DAISIES WERE ALL AROUND HIM
8071-114972-0028 THE MIRROR OF THE PRINCESS AS I HAVE SAID WAS MADE OF GOLD AND IVORY AND WONDERFUL CRYSTAL AND MANY PRECIOUS STONES SO WHEN THE MINSTREL TOOK IT IN HIS HANDS OUT OF THE GRASS HE THOUGHT
8071-114972-0029 WELL THAT HE MIGHT AT LEAST BUY A BREAKFAST AT THE NEXT TOWN FOR HE WAS VERY HUNGRY WELL HE CAUGHT UP THE MIRROR AND HID IT IN HIS FADED DOUBLET AND TOOK HIS WAY TO A WOOD OF LIVING GREEN
8071-114972-0030 AND WHEN HE WAS ALONE THAT IS ALONE WITH A FEW FLOWERS AND A BIRD OR TWO AND A MILLION LEAVES AND THE SOFT SINGING OF A LITTLE RIVER
8071-114972-0031 HE TOOK OUT THE MIRROR FROM HIS DOUBLET SHAME UPON HIM HE A POET OF THE RAINBOW HAD ONLY ONE THOUGHT AS HE TOOK UP THE MIRROR THE GOLD AND IVORY AND THE PRECIOUS STONES
8071-114972-0032 HE WAS MERELY THINKING OF THEM AND HIS BREAKFAST
8071-114972-0033 HE DROPPED THE MIRROR HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE WILD ROSE AS IT OPENS ITS HEART TO THE MORNING SKY HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE HAWTHORN HOLDING IN ITS FRAGRANT ARMS ITS INNUMERABLE BLOOMS HAVE YOU SEEN THE RISING OF THE MOON
8071-114972-0034 THE MINSTREL LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND SAW SOMETHING FAR MORE WONDERFUL THAN ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS HE SAW THE FACE OF THE PRINCESS
8071-114972-0035 THAT HE COULD NEVER BRING HIMSELF TO SELL IT AND THAT HE MUST GO WITHOUT HIS BREAKFAST THE MOON HAD FALLEN INTO HIS HAND OUT OF THE SKY COULD HE A POET EXCHANGE THIS CELESTIAL WINDFALL FOR A MEAL AND A NEW DOUBLET
8071-114972-0036 MANY KINGS AND CAPTAINS HAD VAINLY TRIED TO BUY FROM HIM HIS GIFT OF COURAGE BUT THE MINSTREL HAD SOLD NEITHER AND NOW HAD FALLEN OUT OF THE SKY ONE MORE PRECIOUS THING TO GUARD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FACE IN THE WORLD
8071-114972-0037 THE MINSTREL AWOKE FROM HIS DREAM AT THE SOUND OF HORSEMEN IN THE VALLEY THE PRINCESS WAS SENDING HERALDS INTO EVERY CORNER OF HER DOMINIONS TO PROCLAIM THE LOSS OF THE MIRROR AND FOR ITS RETURN A BEAUTIFUL REWARD A LOCK OF HER STRANGE HAIR
8071-114972-0038 THE MINSTREL HID HIMSELF WITH HIS TREASURE AMID THE FERN AND WHEN THE TRUMPETS HAD FADED IN THE DISTANCE FOUND THE HIGHROAD AGAIN AND WENT UPON HIS WAY NOW IT CHANCED THAT A SCULLERY MAID OF THE CASTLE
8071-114972-0039 AS SHE WAS POLISHING A COPPER SAUCEPAN HAD LIFTED HER EYES FROM HER WORK AND LOOKING DOWN TOWARD THE HIGHROAD HAD SEEN
8071-114972-0040 WAS A VERY WELL KNOWN MINSTREL ALL THE SCULLERY MAIDS AND ALL THE PRINCESSES HAD HIS SONGS BY HEART EVEN THE BIRDS WERE FABLED TO SING HIS SONGS AS THEY FLITTED TO AND FRO
8071-114972-0041 JEWS WITH GREAT MONEY BAGS CAME TO BUY FROM HIM THE BEAUTIFUL FACE SOMETIMES HE HAD TO CLIMB UP INTO TREES TO LOOK AT IT IN THE SUNRISE THE WOODS WERE SO FILLED WITH THE VOICES OF HIS PURSUERS BUT NEITHER HUNGER NOR POVERTY
8071-114972-0042 NOR SMALL FEROCIOUS ENEMIES WERE ABLE TO TAKE FROM HIM THE BEAUTIFUL FACE IT NEVER LEFT HIS HEART ALL NIGHT LONG AND ALL THE WATCHING DAY IT WAS PRESSED CLOSE TO HIS SIDE MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WAS IN DESPAIR
8071-114972-0043 MORE AND MORE THE FANCY POSSESSED HER THAT WITH THE LOST MIRROR HER BEAUTY TOO WAS LOST IN HER UNHAPPINESS LIKE ALL SAD PEOPLE SHE TOOK STRANGE WAYS OF ESCAPE SHE CONSULTED THE STARS
8071-114972-0044 AND EMPIRICS FROM THE FOUR WINDS SETTLED DOWN UPON HER CASTLE EACH OF COURSE HAD HIS OWN INVALUABLE NOSTRUM AND ALL WENT THEIR WAY FOR NOT ONE OF THESE UNDERSTOOD THE HEART OF A POET HOWEVER
8071-114972-0045 OF NINETY YEARS A FAMOUS SEER DEEPLY AND GENTLY AND PITIFULLY LEARNED IN THE HEARTS OF MEN
8071-114972-0046 AND HIS OLD WISE HEART WENT OUT TO HER AND AS I HAVE SAID HIS HEART UNDERSTOOD THE MINSTREL TOO THEREFORE HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS I KNOW THE HEARTS OF POETS
8071-114972-0047 AND THE POET TOOK THE MIRROR FROM THE OLD MAN AND LOOKED AND AS HE LOOKED THE MIRROR OF THE PRINCESS FELL NEGLECTED IN THE GRASS
8071-114972-0048 DO YOU LET FALL THE PRINCESS'S MIRROR BUT THE POET MADE NO ANSWER
8071-114972-0049 WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE MIRROR SAID THE OLD MAN THAT YOU GAZE SO EARNESTLY IN IT I SEE ANSWERED THE MINSTREL THE INFINITE MIRACLE OF THE UNIVERSE I SEE THE AUGUST AND LONELY ELEMENTS
8071-114972-0050 YET LOOK AGAIN SAID THE OLD MAN INTO THIS OTHER MIRROR THE MIRROR OF THE PRINCESS LOOK AGAIN AND THE POET LOOKED TAKING THE TWO MIRRORS IN HIS HANDS
8071-114972-0051 AND LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AT LAST HE SAID GAZING INTO THE FACE HE HAD FOUGHT SO LONG TO KEEP
8071-114972-0052 A FLUTTERING FLOWER OF A FACE JUST ONE BEAUTIFUL FLOWER IN THE INNUMERABLE MEADOWS OF THE INFINITE BUT HERE
8071-114972-0053 HERE IS THE ETERNAL BEAUTY THE DIVINE HARMONY THE SACRED UNFATHOMABLE ALL WOULD A MAN BE CONTENT WITH ONE ROSE WHEN ALL THE ROSES OF ALL THE ROSE GARDENS OF THE WORLD WERE HIS
8071-114972-0054 YOU MEAN SAID THE WISE OLD MAN SMILING TO HIMSELF THAT I MAY TAKE THE MIRROR BACK TO THE PRINCESS ARE YOU REALLY WILLING TO EXCHANGE HER FACE FOR THE FACE OF THE SKY I AM ANSWERED THE MINSTREL
