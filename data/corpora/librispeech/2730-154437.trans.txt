2730-154437-0000 CHAPTER NINE ANOTHER MYSTERY WHEN JENNINGS ARRIVED THAT EVENING ACCORDING TO APPOINTMENT HE FOUND MALLOW IN A STATE OF DESPERATION
2730-154437-0001 THAT HE FELT AS THOUGH ON THE POINT OF LOSING HIS REASON HE WAS QUITE DELIGHTED WHEN HE SAW JENNINGS AND THUS HAD SOMEONE WITH A CLEAR HEAD IN WHOM TO CONFIDE WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED JENNINGS WHO AT ONCE SAW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG FROM CUTHBERT'S ANXIOUS FACE
2730-154437-0002 THINGS ARE GETTING MORE MYSTERIOUS EVERY DAY
2730-154437-0003 I AM WITH YOU HEART AND SOUL I HAVE THE DETECTIVE FEVER WITH A VENGEANCE YOU CAN COUNT ON MY ASSISTANCE IN EVERY WAY
2730-154437-0004 SIT DOWN AND LET US HAVE A QUIET TALK BEFORE THIS GIRL ARRIVES SUSAN GRANT I SAW HER TO DAY DID YOU SPEAK TO HER
2730-154437-0005 AND FROM THE FACT THAT SHE ENTERED ROSE COTTAGE AH SAID JENNINGS TAKING A SEAT SO YOU HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE YES I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
2730-154437-0006 AT HALF PAST EIGHT SHE'LL BE HERE IN HALF AN HOUR GO ON WHAT'S UP READ THIS SAID CUTHBERT AND PASSED ALONG THE NOTE FROM JULIET I RECEIVED THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU WENT THE OTHER NIGHT
2730-154437-0007 IT IS STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD WRITE IN THAT WAY SAID HE
2730-154437-0008 WHAT DOES SHE MEAN I CAN'T TELL YOU I MET HER TO DAY
2730-154437-0009 AND THE INTERVIEW WITH JULIET NOW WHAT DOES SHE MEAN HE ADDED IN HIS TURN TALKING AS THOUGH I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MATTER SOMEONE'S BEEN POISONING HER MIND THAT BROTHER OF HERS PERHAPS WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF HIM ASKED CUTHBERT QUICKLY
2730-154437-0010 NOTHING GOOD HE'S AN HYSTERICAL IDIOT GAMBLES A LOT AND FALLS INTO RAGES WHEN HE LOSES AT TIMES I DON'T THINK HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTIONS
2730-154437-0011 EVERY WORD JENNINGS SPOKE MADE HIM MORE CONFIDENT THAT BASIL HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CRIME BUT WHY JULIET SHOULD HINT AT HIS OWN GUILT CUTHBERT COULD NOT IMAGINE HAD HE BEEN CALMER HE MIGHT HAVE HESITATED TO TELL JENNINGS ABOUT BASIL
2730-154437-0012 BUT EXASPERATED BY JULIET'S HALF CONFIDENCE AND ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE TRUTH HE GAVE THE DETECTIVE A FULL ACCOUNT OF HIS MEETING WITH THE YOUNG MAN WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT HE ASKED WELL SAID JENNINGS DOUBTFULLY THERE'S NOTHING MUCH TO GO UPON IN WHAT HE SAID
2730-154437-0013 HE'S IN DIFFICULTIES WITH HALE CERTAINLY AND HE SEEMED ANXIOUS ABOUT MY HAVING BEEN IN CARANBY'S GROUNDS AT NIGHT WERE YOU THERE YES
2730-154437-0014 I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HER BUT I AM SURE HER MOTHER AND BASIL ARE TRYING TO INFLUENCE HER AGAINST ME
2730-154437-0015 BUT ON WHAT GROUNDS ASKED JENNINGS QUICKLY WE'LL COME TO THAT PRESENTLY
2730-154437-0016 BY THE WILL OF MISS LOACH JULIET COMES IN FOR SIX THOUSAND A YEAR WHICH IS COMPLETELY AT HER OWN DISPOSAL
2730-154437-0017 THEY KNOW IF JULIET BECOMES MY WIFE I WON'T LET THEM PREY ON HER
2730-154437-0018 BUT I THOUGHT MISSUS OCTAGON WAS WELL OFF NO SAXON HER LATE HUSBAND LEFT HER VERY LITTLE AND OCTAGON FOR ALL HIS MEEKNESS KNOWS HOW TO KEEP HIS MONEY BOTH MOTHER AND SON ARE EXTRAVAGANT SO THEY HOPE TO MAKE POOR JULIET THEIR BANKER
2730-154437-0019 IN SOME WAY THEY HAVE IMPLICATED ME IN THE CRIME AND JULIET THINKS THAT I AM IN DANGER OF THE GALLOWS THAT IS WHY SHE WROTE THAT MYSTERIOUS NOTE JENNINGS
2730-154437-0020 WHICH SHOWS THAT SHE THINKS ME GUILTY I COULD NOT GET A FURTHER EXPLANATION FROM HER AS SHE RAN AWAY HANG IT CUTHBERT JUMPED UP ANGRILY IF SHE'D ONLY TELL ME THE TRUTH AND SPEAK STRAIGHT OUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS SILENCE ON HER PART I CAN SAID JENNINGS PROMPTLY
2730-154437-0021 IN SOME WAY BASIL IS MIXED UP IN THE MATTER AND HIS ACCUSING YOU MEANS HIS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE WAS NEAR ROSE COTTAGE ON THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME HE FUNKS MAKING SO DAMAGING AN ADMISSION AH I DARESAY SAID CUTHBERT
2730-154437-0022 DID HE QUARREL WITH HER OF COURSE DIDN'T I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID TO DAY HE'S IN A FINE RAGE WITH THE DEAD WOMAN AND YOU KNOW WHAT AN UNCONTROLLABLE TEMPER HE HAS I'VE SEEN HIM RAGE AT MARAQUITO'S WHEN HE LOST AT BACCARAT SILLY ASS HE CAN'T PLAY DECENTLY AND LOSE HIS MONEY LIKE A GENTLEMAN
2730-154437-0023 SHE'S THE SOUL OF HONOR AND BASIL BAH HE QUARRELLED WITH HIS AUNT MURMURED JENNINGS
2730-154437-0024 DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WAS ON THAT NIGHT YES JULIET AND HE WENT TO THE MARLOW THEATRE TO SEE A MELODRAMA BY A NEW PLAYWRIGHT HA SAID JENNINGS HALF TO HIMSELF AND THE MARLOW THEATRE IS NOT FAR FROM REXTON I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF THAT
2730-154437-0025 HAD THEY A BOX I BELIEVE SO IT WAS SENT BY THE MAN WHO WROTE THE PLAY WHO IS HE I CAN'T SAY
2730-154437-0026 WERE YOU DOWN THERE ON THAT NIGHT YES SAID CUTHBERT WITH HESITATION AND TO JENNINGS SURPRISE I DID NOT INTEND TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT AS MY UNCLE ASKED ME TO HOLD MY TONGUE BUT SINCE THINGS HAVE COME TO THIS PASS YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW THAT I WAS THERE
2730-154437-0027 AND ABOUT THE TIME OF THE MURDER TOO JENNINGS SAT UP AND STARED GREAT HEAVENS MALLOW WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS THE OTHER NIGHT
2730-154437-0028 I PROMISED MY UNCLE TO HOLD MY TONGUE BUT NOW YOU WILL TELL ME ALL MY DEAR FELLOW MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT REST EASY YOU SHALL LEARN EVERYTHING YOU KNOW THAT THE HOUSE AT THE BACK OF ROSE COTTAGE HAS BEEN DESERTED FOR SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY YEARS MORE OR LESS
2730-154437-0029 YES YOU TOLD ME ABOUT IT THE OTHER NIGHT CARANBY RAN A FIFTEEN FEET WALL ROUND IT AND THE INSIDE IS A REGULAR JUNGLE
2730-154437-0030 LIGHTS HAVE BEEN SEEN MOVING ABOUT AND STRANGE NOISES HAVE BEEN HEARD WHAT KIND OF NOISES
2730-154437-0031 I HEARD INDIRECTLY ABOUT THIS THROUGH JULIET WHERE DID SHE HEAR THE REPORT FROM MISS LOACH'S COOK A WOMAN CALLED PILL THE COOK ASSERTED THAT THE HOUSE WAS HAUNTED AND DESCRIBED THE NOISES AND THE LIGHTS
2730-154437-0032 I DON'T BELIEVE IN SPOOKS MYSELF AND THOUGHT SOME TRICKS WERE BEING PLAYED SO ONE DAY I WENT DOWN AND HAD A LOOK THAT DAY I WAS THERE ASKED JENNINGS RECALLING CUTHBERT'S PRESENCE BEFORE THAT A WEEK OR TWO I SAW NOTHING THE HOUSE IS ROTTING AND NOTHING APPEARED TO BE DISTURBED
2730-154437-0033 I EXAMINED THE PARK AND FOUND NO FOOTMARKS IN FACT THERE WASN'T A SIGN OF ANYONE ABOUT YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE AT NIGHT WHEN THE GHOST WAS LARKING THAT'S WHAT CARANBY SAID I TOLD HIM WHEN HE CAME BACK TO LONDON HE WAS VERY ANNOYED
2730-154437-0034 YOU KNOW HIS ROMANCE ABOUT THAT HOUSE AN ABSURD THING IT IS ALL THE SAME CARANBY IS TENDER ON THE POINT I ADVISED HIM TO PULL THE HOUSE DOWN AND LET THE LAND OUT FOR BUILDING LEASES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BUT ASKED ME TO GO AT NIGHT AND STIR UP THE GHOST
2730-154437-0035 AND GOT INTO THE GROUNDS BY CLIMBING THE WALL THERE'S NO GATE YOU KNOW AT WHAT TIME SOME TIME BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN I'M NOT QUITE SURE GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS THE VERY HOUR THE WOMAN WAS KILLED YES AND FOR THAT REASON I HELD MY TONGUE
2730-154437-0036 PARTICULARLY AS I GOT OVER THE WALL NEAR THE COTTAGE WHERE DO YOU MEAN
2730-154437-0037 DID YOU ENTER MISS LOACH'S GROUNDS NO I HAD NO RIGHT TO I SAW A LIGHT IN THE BASEMENT BUT I DID NOT TAKE MUCH NOTICE
2730-154437-0038 WELL I RAN ALONG THE FENCE ON THE FIELD OF CORN SIDE REMEMBER AND GOT OVER THE WALL THEN I DODGED THROUGH THE PARK SCRATCHING MYSELF A LOT I COULD FIND NOTHING THE HOUSE SEEMED QUIET ENOUGH SO AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I HAD ENOUGH OF IT
2730-154437-0039 I GOT OUT OVER THE WALL ON THE OTHER SIDE AND CAME HOME I CAUGHT A COLD WHICH NECESSITATED MY WEARING A GREAT COAT THE NEXT DAY SO THERE YOU HAVE MY GHOST HUNTING AND A FINE FOOL I WAS TO GO
2730-154437-0040 DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE COTTAGE NOT A THING I SAW NO ONE I HEARD NO SOUND NOT EVEN A SCREAM NOT EVEN A SCREAM SAID MALLOW
2730-154437-0041 STRANGE MURMURED JENNINGS CAN'T YOU TELL THE EXACT TIME NOT TO A MINUTE IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER TEN I CAN'T SAY HOW MANY MINUTES PERHAPS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
2730-154437-0042 JENNINGS LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE CARPET
2730-154437-0043 WHICH WAY OVER THE WALL AND THROUGH THE PARK YOU SEE HE COULD NOT HAVE GONE UP THE LANE OR THROUGH THE RAILWAY PATH WITHOUT STUMBLING AGAINST THAT POLICEMAN BUT HE MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR AT HALF PAST TEN
2730-154437-0044 AND CLIMBED AS YOU DID OVER THE WALL TO CROSS THE PARK AND DROP OVER THE OTHER IN THIS WAY HE WOULD ELUDE THE POLICE PERHAPS SAID CUTHBERT DISBELIEVINGLY BUT IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN WHEN I LEFT THE PARK IF ANYONE HAD BEEN AT MY HEELS I WOULD HAVE NOTICED
2730-154437-0045 I AM NOT SO SURE OF THAT THE PARK AS YOU SAY IS A KIND OF JUNGLE
2730-154437-0046 MOREOVER ADDED THE DETECTIVE SITTING UP ALERTLY HE MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN TO MISS SAXON SAYING HE SAW YOU ON THAT NIGHT AND SHE BOSH INTERRUPTED MALLOW ROUGHLY HE WOULD GIVE HIMSELF AWAY NOT IF THE LETTER WAS ANONYMOUS
2730-154437-0047 IN THAT CASE HE MUST EXPLAIN HIS REASON FOR BEING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT HOUR BUT HE WON'T AND YOU MAY BE SURE MISS SAXON FOR HIS SAKE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE NO MALLOW SOMEONE ACCUSES YOU TO MISS SAXON BASIL OR ANOTHER IF WE COULD ONLY MAKE HER SPEAK
2730-154437-0048 CUTHBERT SHOOK HIS HEAD I FEAR IT'S IMPOSSIBLE WHY NOT LET ME ARREST YOU SUGGESTED JENNINGS AND THEN IF AT ANYTIME SHE WOULD SPEAK
2730-154437-0049 THAT WOULD BE TOO REALISTIC JENNINGS I DON'T WANT IT KNOWN THAT I WAS HANGING ABOUT THE PLACE ON THAT NIGHT MY EXPLANATION MIGHT NOT BE BELIEVED
2730-154437-0050 YES I CAN SEE THAT WELL JENNINGS ROSE AND STRETCHED HIMSELF I MUST SEE WHAT SUSAN HAS TO SAY
2730-154437-0051 SHE SHOULD BE HERE IN A FEW MINUTES A SILENCE ENSUED WHICH WAS BROKEN BY JENNINGS OH BY THE WAY HE SAID
2730-154437-0052 I LOOKED UP THE SAUL CASE WELL WHAT ABOUT IT ASKED CUTHBERT INDOLENTLY
2730-154437-0053 THERE WAS A MOTHER A BROTHER AND A DAUGHTER EMILIA JUST SO THEY WERE ALL COINERS SOMEWHERE IN HAMPSTEAD THEY HAD A REGULAR FACTORY OTHERS WERE MIXED UP IN THE MATTER ALSO BUT MISSUS SAUL WAS THE HEAD OF THE GANG THEN EMILIA GREW TIRED OF THE LIFE I EXPECT IT TOLD ON HER NERVES
2730-154437-0054 THEN SHE DIED AS YOU KNOW AFTERWARDS THE MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE CAUGHT THEY BOLTED THE MOTHER I BELIEVE DIED
2730-154437-0055 THE BROTHER WENT TO JAIL GOT OUT YEARS AFTERWARDS ON TICKET OF LEAVE AND THEN DIED ALSO
2730-154437-0056 CUTHBERT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS THIS DOES NOT HELP US MUCH NO BUT IT SHOWS YOU WHAT AN ESCAPE YOUR UNCLE HAD FROM MARRYING THE WOMAN I CAN'T UNDERSTAND NO MORE CAN CARANBY SAID MALLOW SMILING
2730-154437-0057 HE LOVED MISS LOACH BUT EMILIA EXERCISED A KIND OF HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE OVER HIM HOWEVER SHE IS DEAD AND I CAN SEE NO CONNECTION BETWEEN HER AND THIS CRIME WELL SAID JENNINGS SOBERLY
2730-154437-0058 IT APPEARS THAT SOME OTHER PERSON BESIDES THE MOTHER GAVE A CLUE TO THE BREAKING UP OF THE GANG AND THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE FACTORY SUPPOSING THAT PERSON WAS SELINA LOACH WHO HATED EMILIA FOR HAVING TAKEN CARANBY FROM HER ONE OF THE GANG RELEASED LATELY FROM PRISON
2730-154437-0059 MAY HAVE KILLED THE OLD LADY OUT OF REVENGE WHAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS REVENGE IS A PASSION THAT GROWS WITH YEARS SAID JENNINGS GRIMLY AT ALL EVENTS I INTEND TO GO ON FERRETING OUT EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS OLD COINING CASE
2730-154437-0060 MISS LOACH MAY HAVE KNOWN AND THIS IS ALL SUPPOSITION CRIED MALLOW I CAN'T SEE THE SLIGHTEST CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COINERS AND THIS MURDER BESIDES IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHY JULIET HINTS AT MY BEING IMPLICATED JENNINGS DID NOT REPLY
2730-154437-0061 THAT MIGHT BE EXPLAINED HE LOOKED UP BRISKLY
2730-154437-0062 IT'S QUITE BIG ENOUGH FOR ME AS IT IS RETORTED CUTHBERT ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
2730-154437-0063 THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO SAID JENNINGS OBSTINATELY
2730-154437-0064 BUT I FEEL THAT A DISCOVERY IN ONE CASE ENTAILS A DISCOVERY IN THE OTHER IF I CAN PROVE THAT MISS LOACH WAS KILLED BY ONE OF THE OLD COINERS WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN I MAY STUMBLE ON THE FACTORY THAT IS IN EXISTENCE NOW HE WOULD HAVE GONE ON TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF MORE FULLY
2730-154437-0065 MALLOW ORDERED THE SERVANT TO ADMIT HER AND SHORTLY SUSAN GRANT
2730-154437-0066 PLACING A CHAIR FOR HER THIS IS MISTER MALLOW
2730-154437-0067 AT ROSE COTTAGE SAID MALLOW INQUIRINGLY NO WHEN I WAS WITH SENORA GREDOS AS PARLOR MAID SENORA GREDOS SAID JENNINGS BEFORE CUTHBERT COULD SPEAK DO YOU MEAN MARAQUITO
2730-154437-0068 I HAVE HEARD THAT HER NAME WAS MARAQUITO SIR SAID SUSAN CALMLY A LAME LADY AND FOND OF CARDS SHE LIVES IN I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES SAID CUTHBERT FLUSHING IN HIS TURN
