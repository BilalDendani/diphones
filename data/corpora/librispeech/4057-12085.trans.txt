4057-12085-0000 FOR A FEW SECONDS DARRELL TRIED VAINLY TO RECALL WHAT HAD AWAKENED HIM LOW CONFUSED SOUNDS OCCASIONALLY REACHED HIS EARS BUT THEY SEEMED PART OF HIS OWN TROUBLED DREAMS THE HEAT WAS INTOLERABLE
4057-12085-0001 HE RAISED HIMSELF TO THE OPEN WINDOW THAT HE MIGHT GET A BREATH OF COOLER AIR HIS HEAD WHIRLED BUT THE HALF SITTING POSTURE SEEMED TO CLEAR HIS BRAIN AND HE RECALLED HIS SURROUNDINGS AT ONCE HE BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT THE TRAIN WAS NOT IN MOTION
4057-12085-0002 YET NO SOUND OF TRAINMEN'S VOICES CAME THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW ALL WAS DEAD SILENCE AND THE VAGUE HAUNTING SENSE OF IMPENDING DANGER QUICKENED SUDDENLY HE HEARD A MUTTERED OATH IN ONE OF THE SECTIONS FOLLOWED BY AN ORDER
4057-12085-0003 LOW BUT PEREMPTORY NO NOISE HAND OVER AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT INSTANTLY DARRELL COMPREHENDED THE SITUATION PEERING CAUTIOUSLY BETWEEN THE CURTAINS HE SAW AT THE FORWARD END OF THE SLEEPER
4057-12085-0004 A MASKED MAN WITH A REVOLVER IN EACH HAND WHILE THE MIRROR BEHIND HIM REVEALED ANOTHER FIGURE AT THE REAR MASKED AND ARMED IN LIKE MANNER HE HEARD ANOTHER ORDER THE MAN WAS DOING HIS WORK SWIFTLY HE THOUGHT AT ONCE OF YOUNG WHITCOMB
4057-12085-0005 BUT NO SOUND CAME FROM THE OPPOSITE SECTION AND HE SANK QUIETLY BACK UPON HIS PILLOW A MOMENT LATER THE CURTAINS WERE QUICKLY THRUST ASIDE THE MUZZLE OF A REVOLVER CONFRONTED DARRELL AND THE SAME LOW VOICE DEMANDED
4057-12085-0006 HAND OUT YOUR VALUABLES A MAN OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WEARING A MASK AND FULL BEARD STOOD OVER HIM DARRELL QUIETLY HANDED OVER HIS WATCH AND PURSE NOTING AS HE DID SO THE MAN'S HANDS WHITE WELL FORMED WELL KEPT
4057-12085-0007 HE HALF EXPECTED A FURTHER DEMAND AS THE PURSE CONTAINED ONLY A FEW SMALL BILLS AND SOME CHANGE THE BULK OF HIS MONEY BEING SECRETED ABOUT THE MATTRESS AS WAS HIS HABIT BUT THE MAN TURNED WITH PECULIAR ABRUPTNESS TO THE OPPOSITE SECTION
4057-12085-0008 AS ONE WHO HAD A DEFINITE OBJECT IN VIEW AND WAS IN HASTE TO ACCOMPLISH IT DARRELL HIS FACULTIES ALERT OBSERVED THAT THE SECTION IN FRONT OF WHITCOMB'S WAS EMPTY HE RECALLED THE ACTIONS OF ITS OCCUPANT ON THE PRECEDING AFTERNOON
4057-12085-0009 HIS BUSINESS LATER AT THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE AND THE WHOLE SCHEME FLASHED VIVIDLY BEFORE HIS MIND THE MAN HAD BEEN A SPY SENT OUT BY THE BAND NOW HOLDING THE TRAIN AND WHITCOMB'S MONEY WAS WITHOUT DOUBT THE PARTICULAR OBJECT OF THE HOLD UP
4057-12085-0010 LEANING SLIGHTLY TOWARDS HIM THE MAN SHOOK HIM AND HIS FIRST WORDS CONFIRMED DARRELL'S INTUITIONS HAND OVER THAT MONEY YOUNG MAN AND NO FUSS ABOUT IT EITHER WHITCOMB INSTANTLY AWAKE
4057-12085-0011 GAZED AT THE MASKED FACE WITHOUT A WORD OR MOVEMENT DARRELL POWERLESS TO AID HIS FRIEND WATCHED INTENTLY DREADING SOME RASH ACT ON HIS PART TO WHICH HIS IMPETUOUS NATURE MIGHT PROMPT HIM
4057-12085-0012 AGAIN HE HEARD THE LOW TONES THIS TIME A NOTE OF DANGER IN THEM NO FOOLING HAND THAT MONEY OVER LIVELY WITH A SPRING AS SUDDEN AND NOISELESS AS A PANTHER'S WHITCOMB GRAPPLED WITH THE MAN
4057-12085-0013 KNOCKING THE REVOLVER FROM HIS HAND UPON THE BED A QUICK DESPERATE SILENT STRUGGLE FOLLOWED WHITCOMB SUDDENLY REACHED FOR THE REVOLVER
4057-12085-0014 AND THE NEXT INSTANT HIS FRIEND SANK LIMP AND MOTIONLESS UPON THE BED FOOL HE HEARD THE MAN MUTTER WITH AN OATH AN INVOLUNTARY GROAN ESCAPED FROM DARRELL'S LIPS SLIGHT AS WAS THE SOUND
4057-12085-0015 THE MAN HEARD IT AND TURNED FACING HIM THE LATTER WAS SCREENED BY THE CURTAINS AND THE MAN SEEING NO ONE RETURNED TO HIS WORK BUT THAT BRIEF GLANCE HAD REVEALED ENOUGH TO DARRELL THAT HE KNEW HE COULD HENCEFORTH IDENTIFY THE MURDERER AMONG A THOUSAND
4057-12085-0016 IN THE STRUGGLE THE MASK HAD BEEN PARTIALLY PUSHED ASIDE EXPOSING A PORTION OF THE MAN'S FACE A SCAR OF PECULIAR SHAPE SHOWED WHITE AGAINST THE OLIVE SKIN CLOSE TO THE CURLING BLACK HAIR
4057-12085-0017 BUT TO DARRELL THE PRE EMINENTLY DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC OF THAT FACE WAS THE EYES OF THE MOST PERFECT STEEL BLUE HE HAD EVER SEEN THEY SEEMED AS THEY TURNED UPON HIM IN THAT INTENSE GLANCE
4057-12085-0018 TO GLINT AND SCINTILLATE LIKE THE POINTS OF TWO RAPIERS IN A BRILLIANT SWORD PLAY WHILE THEIR LOOK OF CONCENTRATED FURY AND MALIGNITY MORE DEMON LIKE THAN HUMAN WAS STAMPED INEFFACEABLY UPON HIS BRAIN
4057-12085-0019 HAVING SECURED AS MUCH AS HE COULD FIND OF THE MONEY THE MURDERER LEFT HASTILY AND SILENTLY AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE GUARDS AFTER A WARNING TO THE PASSENGERS NOT TO LEAVE THEIR BERTHS TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE
4057-12085-0020 HAVING PARTIALLY DRESSED DARRELL AT ONCE SPRANG ACROSS THE AISLE AND TOOK WHITCOMB'S LIMP FORM IN HIS ARMS HIS HEART STILL BEAT FAINTLY BUT HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND BLEEDING PROFUSELY ALL HAD BEEN DONE SO SILENTLY AND SWIFTLY
4057-12085-0021 THAT NO ONE OUTSIDE OF DARRELL DREAMED OF MURDER AND SOON THE ENFORCED SILENCE BEGAN TO BE BROKEN BY HURRIED QUESTIONS AND ANGRY EXCLAMATIONS A MAN CURSED OVER THE LOSS OF HIS MONEY AND A WOMAN SOBBED HYSTERICALLY SUDDENLY
4057-12085-0022 DARRELL'S INCISIVE TONES RANG THROUGH THE SLEEPER FOR GOD'S SAKE SEE IF THERE IS A SURGEON ABOARD HERE IS A MAN STABBED DYING DON'T STOP TO TALK OF MONEY WHEN A LIFE IS AT STAKE
4057-12085-0023 INSTANTLY ALL THOUGHT OF PERSONAL LOSS WAS FOR THE TIME FORGOTTEN AND HALF A DOZEN MEN RESPONDED TO DARRELL'S APPEAL WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE TRAIN WHAT HAD OCCURRED THE GREATEST EXCITEMENT FOLLOWED
4057-12085-0024 TRAIN OFFICIALS HURRYING BACK AND FORTH STOPPED HUSHED AND HORROR STRICKEN BESIDE THE SECTION WHERE DARRELL SAT HOLDING WHITCOMB IN HIS ARMS PASSENGERS FROM THE OTHER COACHES CROWDED IN EAGER TO OFFER ASSISTANCE THAT WAS OF NO AVAIL
4057-12085-0025 A PHYSICIAN WAS FOUND AND CAME QUICKLY TO THE SCENE WHO AFTER A BRIEF EXAMINATION SILENTLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND DARRELL WATCHING THE WEAKENING PULSE AND SHORTENING GASPS NEEDED NO WORDS TO TELL HIM
4057-12085-0026 THAT THE YOUNG LIFE WAS EBBING FAST JUST AS THE FAINT RESPIRATIONS HAD BECOME ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE WHITCOMB OPENED HIS EYES LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO DARRELL'S EYES WITH EAGER INTENSITY HIS FACE LIGHTED WITH THE WINNING SMILE
4057-12085-0027 WHICH DARRELL HAD ALREADY LEARNED TO LOVE HIS LIPS MOVED DARRELL BENT HIS HEAD STILL LOWER TO LISTEN KATE YOU WILL SEE HER HE WHISPERED TELL HER
4057-12085-0028 BUT THE SENTENCE WAS NEVER FINISHED DEFTLY AND GENTLY AS A WOMAN DARRELL DID THE LITTLE WHICH REMAINED TO BE DONE FOR HIS YOUNG FRIEND CLOSING THE EYES IN WHICH THE LOVE LIGHT KINDLED BY HIS DYING WORDS STILL LINGERED
4057-12085-0029 SMOOTHING THE DISHEVELLED GOLDEN HAIR WONDERING WITHIN HIMSELF AT HIS OWN UNWONTED TENDERNESS AN AWFUL PITY FOR A BRIGHT YOUNG LIFE TO GO OUT LIKE THAT SAID A VOICE AT HIS SIDE AND TURNING HE SAW PARKINSON
4057-12085-0030 HOW DID IT HAPPEN THE LATTER INQUIRED RECOGNIZING DARRELL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE DIM LIGHT BRIEFLY DARRELL GAVE THE MAIN FACTS AS HE HAD WITNESSED THEM SAYING NOTHING HOWEVER OF HIS HAVING SEEN THE FACE OF THE MURDERER
4057-12085-0031 THE MISTAKE WAS IN GIVING ONE SO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED A COMMISSION INVOLVING SO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY AND DANGER YOU KNEW OF THE MONEY THEN YES THAT WAS BAD BUSINESS FOR HIM POOR FELLOW I WONDER BY THE WAY IF IT WAS ALL TAKEN
4057-12085-0032 AT DARRELL'S SUGGESTION A THOROUGH SEARCH WAS MADE WHICH RESULTED IN THE FINDING OF A PACKAGE CONTAINING FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH THE THIEF IN HIS HASTE HAD EVIDENTLY OVERLOOKED THIS IT WAS AGREED SHOULD BE PLACED IN DARRELL'S KEEPING UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF THE TRAIN AT OPHIR
4057-12085-0033 GRADUALLY THE CROWD DISPERSED MOST OF THE PASSENGERS RETURNING TO THEIR BERTHS DARRELL KNOWING THAT SLEEP FOR HIMSELF WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION SOUGHT AN EMPTY SECTION IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CAR AND SEATING HIMSELF
4057-12085-0034 BOWED HIS HEAD UPON HIS HANDS THE VEINS IN HIS TEMPLES SEEMED NEAR BURSTING AND HIS USUALLY STRONG NERVES QUIVERED FROM THE SHOCK HE HAD UNDERGONE BUT OF THIS HE WAS SCARCELY CONSCIOUS HIS MIND ABNORMALLY ACTIVE
4057-12085-0035 FOR THE TIME HELD HIS PHYSICAL SUFFERINGS IN ABEYANCE HE WAS LIVING OVER AGAIN THE EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW HOURS EVENTS WHICH HAD AWAKENED WITHIN HIM SUSCEPTIBILITIES HE HAD NOT KNOWN HE POSSESSED
4057-12085-0036 WHICH HAD STRUCK A NEW CHORD IN HIS BEING WHOSE VIBRATIONS THRILLED HIM WITH STRANGE UNDEFINABLE PAIN AS HE RECALLED WHITCOMB'S AFFECTIONATE FAMILIARITY
4057-12085-0037 HE SEEMED TO HEAR AGAIN THE LOW MUSICAL CADENCES OF THE BOYISH TONES TO SEE THE SUNNY RADIANCE OF HIS SMILE TO FEEL THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM OF HIS PRESENCE AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY SWEET
4057-12085-0038 OF WHOSE SWEETNESS HE HAD BARELY TASTED HAD SUDDENLY DROPPED OUT OF HIS LIFE HIS HEART GREW SICK WITH BITTER SORROW AS HE RECALLED THE LOOK OF MINGLED APPEAL AND TRUST WHICH SHOT FROM WHITCOMB'S EYES INTO HIS OWN
4057-12085-0039 AS HIS YOUNG LIFE SO FULL OF HOPE OF AMBITION OF LOVE WAS PASSING THROUGH THE DIM PORTALS OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD OH THE PITY OF IT THAT HE AN ACQUAINTANCE OF BUT A FEW HOURS
4057-12085-0040 SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONLY ONE TO WHOM THOSE EYES COULD TURN FOR THEIR LAST MESSAGE OF EARTHLY LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND OH THE IMPOTENCY OF ANY AND ALL HUMAN LOVE THEN NEVER BEFORE HAD DARRELL BEEN BROUGHT SO NEAR THE UNSEEN
4057-12085-0041 THE UNKNOWN ALWAYS SURROUNDING US BUT OF WHICH FEW OF US ARE CONSCIOUS AND FOR HOURS HE SAT MOTIONLESS LOST IN THOUGHT GRAPPLING WITH PROBLEMS HITHERTO UNTHOUGHT OF BUT WHICH NOW PERPLEXED AND BAFFLED HIM AT EVERY TURN
4057-12085-0042 AT LAST WITH A HEAVY SIGH HE OPENED HIS EYES THE GRAY TWILIGHT OF DAWN WAS SLOWLY CREEPING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOPS DISPELLING THE SHADOWS AND THE LIGHT OF A NEW FAITH STREAMING DOWNWARD
4057-12085-0043 FROM THE BEAUTIFUL ETERNAL HILLS OF GOD'S UNBEGINNING PAST WAS BANISHING THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ASSAILED HIM THAT NIGHT HAD BROUGHT TO HIM A REVELATION OF THE AWFUL SOLITUDE OF A HUMAN SOUL
4057-12085-0044 STANDING ALONE ON THE THRESHOLD OF TWO WORLDS BUT IT HAD ALSO REVEALED TO HIM THE LOVE INFINITE DIVINE
