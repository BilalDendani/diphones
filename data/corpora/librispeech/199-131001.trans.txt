199-131001-0000 THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED THE IDEA OF RESTRAINING THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY IN REGARD TO THE COMMON DEFENSE CONSIDERED FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
199-131001-0001 HAMILTON TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
199-131001-0002 OUR OWN EXPERIENCE HAS CORROBORATED THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY THE EXAMPLES OF OTHER NATIONS THAT EMERGENCIES OF THIS SORT WILL SOMETIMES ARISE IN ALL SOCIETIES HOWEVER CONSTITUTED
199-131001-0003 THAT SEDITIONS AND INSURRECTIONS ARE UNHAPPILY MALADIES AS INSEPARABLE FROM THE BODY POLITIC AS TUMORS AND ERUPTIONS FROM THE NATURAL BODY THAT THE IDEA OF GOVERNING AT ALL TIMES BY THE SIMPLE FORCE OF LAW
199-131001-0004 WHICH WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IS THE ONLY ADMISSIBLE PRINCIPLE OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT HAS NO PLACE BUT IN THE REVERIES OF THOSE POLITICAL DOCTORS WHOSE SAGACITY DISDAINS THE ADMONITIONS OF EXPERIMENTAL INSTRUCTION
199-131001-0005 SHOULD SUCH EMERGENCIES AT ANY TIME HAPPEN UNDER THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THERE COULD BE NO REMEDY BUT FORCE THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED MUST BE PROPORTIONED TO THE EXTENT OF THE MISCHIEF IF IT SHOULD BE A SLIGHT COMMOTION IN A SMALL PART OF A STATE
199-131001-0006 AN INSURRECTION WHATEVER MAY BE ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSE EVENTUALLY ENDANGERS ALL GOVERNMENT REGARD TO THE PUBLIC PEACE IF NOT TO THE RIGHTS OF THE UNION WOULD ENGAGE THE CITIZENS TO WHOM THE CONTAGION HAD NOT COMMUNICATED ITSELF TO OPPOSE THE INSURGENTS
199-131001-0007 IT WERE IRRATIONAL TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE DISINCLINED TO ITS SUPPORT IF ON THE CONTRARY THE INSURRECTION SHOULD PERVADE A WHOLE STATE OR A PRINCIPAL PART OF IT THE EMPLOYMENT OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF FORCE MIGHT BECOME UNAVOIDABLE
199-131001-0008 IT APPEARS THAT MASSACHUSETTS FOUND IT NECESSARY TO RAISE TROOPS FOR REPRESSING THE DISORDERS WITHIN THAT STATE THAT PENNSYLVANIA FROM THE MERE APPREHENSION OF COMMOTIONS AMONG A PART OF HER CITIZENS HAS THOUGHT PROPER TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE SAME MEASURE
199-131001-0009 COULD SHE HAVE HOPED FOR SUCCESS IN SUCH AN ENTERPRISE FROM THE EFFORTS OF THE MILITIA ALONE
199-131001-0010 IF IT MUST THEN BE ADMITTED THAT THE NECESSITY OF RECURRING TO A FORCE DIFFERENT FROM THE MILITIA IN CASES OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY NATURE IS APPLICABLE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES WHY SHOULD THE POSSIBILITY
199-131001-0011 THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE UNDER A LIKE NECESSITY IN SIMILAR EXTREMITIES BE MADE AN OBJECTION TO ITS EXISTENCE IS IT NOT SURPRISING THAT MEN WHO DECLARE AN ATTACHMENT TO THE UNION IN THE ABSTRACT SHOULD URGE AS AN OBJECTION TO THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION
199-131001-0012 WHAT APPLIES WITH TENFOLD WEIGHT TO THE PLAN FOR WHICH THEY CONTEND AND WHAT AS FAR AS IT HAS ANY FOUNDATION IN TRUTH IS AN INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF CIVIL SOCIETY UPON AN ENLARGED SCALE
199-131001-0013 WHO WOULD NOT PREFER THAT POSSIBILITY TO THE UNCEASING AGITATIONS AND FREQUENT REVOLUTIONS WHICH ARE THE CONTINUAL SCOURGES OF PETTY REPUBLICS LET US PURSUE THIS EXAMINATION IN ANOTHER LIGHT SUPPOSE IN LIEU OF ONE GENERAL SYSTEM
199-131001-0014 WOULD NOT THE SAME DIFFICULTY OPPOSE ITSELF TO THE OPERATIONS OF EITHER OF THESE CONFEDERACIES WOULD NOT EACH OF THEM BE EXPOSED TO THE SAME CASUALTIES
199-131001-0015 AND WHEN THESE HAPPENED BE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE SAME EXPEDIENTS FOR UPHOLDING ITS AUTHORITY WHICH ARE OBJECTED TO IN A GOVERNMENT FOR ALL THE STATES WOULD THE MILITIA IN THIS SUPPOSITION
199-131001-0016 ALL CANDID AND INTELLIGENT MEN MUST UPON DUE CONSIDERATION ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE OBJECTION IS EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO EITHER OF THE TWO CASES AND THAT WHETHER WE HAVE ONE GOVERNMENT FOR ALL THE STATES OR DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS FOR DIFFERENT PARCELS OF THEM
199-131001-0017 WHICH AMOUNT TO INSURRECTIONS AND REBELLIONS INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER REASONINGS UPON THE SUBJECT
199-131001-0018 TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE POWER OF THE PROPOSED GOVERNMENT IS TO BE IN THE HANDS OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE THIS IS THE ESSENTIAL AND AFTER ALL ONLY EFFICACIOUS SECURITY FOR THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE WHICH IS ATTAINABLE IN CIVIL SOCIETY
199-131001-0019 THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE BETRAY THEIR CONSTITUENTS THERE IS THEN NO RESOURCE LEFT BUT IN THE EXERTION OF THAT ORIGINAL RIGHT OF SELF DEFENSE WHICH IS PARAMOUNT TO ALL POSITIVE FORMS OF GOVERNMENT
199-131001-0020 AND WHICH AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF THE NATIONAL RULERS MAY BE EXERTED WITH INFINITELY BETTER PROSPECT OF SUCCESS THAN AGAINST THOSE OF THE RULERS OF AN INDIVIDUAL STATE IN A SINGLE STATE IF THE PERSONS INTRUSTED WITH SUPREME POWER BECOME USURPERS
199-131001-0021 THE DIFFERENT PARCELS SUBDIVISIONS OR DISTRICTS OF WHICH IT CONSISTS
199-131001-0022 WITHOUT CONCERT WITHOUT SYSTEM WITHOUT RESOURCE EXCEPT IN THEIR COURAGE AND DESPAIR THE USURPERS CLOTHED WITH THE FORMS OF LEGAL AUTHORITY CAN TOO OFTEN CRUSH THE OPPOSITION IN EMBRYO THE SMALLER THE EXTENT OF THE TERRITORY
199-131001-0023 THE MORE DIFFICULT WILL IT BE FOR THE PEOPLE TO FORM A REGULAR OR SYSTEMATIC PLAN OF OPPOSITION
199-131001-0024 INTELLIGENCE CAN BE MORE SPEEDILY OBTAINED OF THEIR PREPARATIONS AND MOVEMENTS AND THE MILITARY FORCE IN THE POSSESSION OF THE USURPERS CAN BE MORE RAPIDLY DIRECTED AGAINST THE PART WHERE THE OPPOSITION HAS BEGUN
199-131001-0025 PROVIDED THE CITIZENS UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS AND ARE DISPOSED TO DEFEND THEM THE NATURAL STRENGTH OF THE PEOPLE IN A LARGE COMMUNITY
199-131001-0026 TO ESTABLISH A TYRANNY BUT IN A CONFEDERACY THE PEOPLE WITHOUT EXAGGERATION MAY BE SAID TO BE ENTIRELY THE MASTERS OF THEIR OWN FATE POWER BEING ALMOST ALWAYS THE RIVAL OF POWER
199-131001-0027 THE PEOPLE BY THROWING THEMSELVES INTO EITHER SCALE WILL INFALLIBLY MAKE IT PREPONDERATE IF THEIR RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY EITHER
199-131001-0028 WHICH CAN NEVER BE TOO HIGHLY PRIZED IT MAY SAFELY BE RECEIVED AS AN AXIOM IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENTS WILL IN ALL POSSIBLE CONTINGENCIES AFFORD COMPLETE SECURITY AGAINST INVASIONS OF THE PUBLIC LIBERTY BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY
199-131001-0029 PROJECTS OF USURPATION CANNOT BE MASKED UNDER PRETENSES SO LIKELY TO ESCAPE THE PENETRATION OF SELECT BODIES OF MEN AS OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE THE LEGISLATURES WILL HAVE BETTER MEANS OF INFORMATION THEY CAN DISCOVER THE DANGER AT A DISTANCE
199-131001-0030 AND THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE THEY CAN AT ONCE ADOPT A REGULAR PLAN OF OPPOSITION IN WHICH THEY CAN COMBINE ALL THE RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY THEY CAN READILY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER IN THE DIFFERENT STATES AND UNITE THEIR COMMON FORCES FOR THE PROTECTION OF THEIR COMMON LIBERTY
199-131001-0031 THE GREAT EXTENT OF THE COUNTRY IS A FURTHER SECURITY WE HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED ITS UTILITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF A FOREIGN POWER AND IT WOULD HAVE PRECISELY THE SAME EFFECT AGAINST THE ENTERPRISES OF AMBITIOUS RULERS IN THE NATIONAL COUNCILS
199-131001-0032 IF THE FEDERAL ARMY SHOULD BE ABLE TO QUELL THE RESISTANCE OF ONE STATE THE DISTANT STATES WOULD HAVE IT IN THEIR POWER TO MAKE HEAD WITH FRESH FORCES THE ADVANTAGES OBTAINED IN ONE PLACE MUST BE ABANDONED TO SUBDUE THE OPPOSITION IN OTHERS
199-131001-0033 AND THE MOMENT THE PART WHICH HAD BEEN REDUCED TO SUBMISSION WAS LEFT TO ITSELF ITS EFFORTS WOULD BE RENEWED AND ITS RESISTANCE REVIVE WE SHOULD RECOLLECT
199-131001-0034 THAT THE EXTENT OF THE MILITARY FORCE MUST AT ALL EVENTS BE REGULATED BY THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME TO COME IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN A LARGE ARMY
