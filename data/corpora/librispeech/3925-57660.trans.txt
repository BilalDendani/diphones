3925-57660-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION CONFIRMATION IS A SACRAMENT IN WHICH THROUGH THE IMPOSITION OF THE BISHOP'S HANDS UNCTION AND PRAYER BAPTIZED PERSONS RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST
3925-57660-0001 THAT THEY MAY STEADFASTLY PROFESS THEIR FAITH AND LEAD UPRIGHT LIVES THIS SACRAMENT IS CALLED CONFIRMATION BECAUSE IT CONFIRMS OR STRENGTHENS THE SOUL BY DIVINE GRACE
3925-57660-0002 SOMETIMES IT IS NAMED THE LAYING ON OF HANDS BECAUSE THE BISHOP IMPOSES HIS HANDS ON THOSE WHOM HE CONFIRMS IT IS ALSO KNOWN BY THE NAME OF CHRISM BECAUSE THE FOREHEAD OF THE PERSON CONFIRMED
3925-57660-0003 IS ANOINTED WITH CHRISM IN THE FORM OF A CROSS FREQUENT MENTION IS MADE OF THIS SACRAMENT IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURE IN THE ACTS IT IS WRITTEN
3925-57660-0004 THEY SENT UNTO THEM PETER AND JOHN
3925-57660-0005 WHEN THEY WERE COME PRAYED FOR THEM THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST FOR HE WAS NOT YET COME UPON ANY OF THEM
3925-57660-0006 AS AN EARNEST OF FUTURE GLORY
3925-57660-0007 BUT GOD WHO WORKETH ALL IN ALL SANCTIFIES THE SOUL BY HIS SECRET OPERATION IT CANNOT BE ASSERTED THAT THE LAYING ON OF HANDS AND THE GRACES WHICH FOLLOWED FROM IT AS RECORDED IN THE ACTS WERE NOT INTENDED TO BE CONTINUED AFTER THE APOSTLES TIMES
3925-57660-0008 FOR THERE IS NO WARRANT FOR SUCH AN ASSUMPTION THIS FUNCTION OF IMPOSING HANDS FORMED AS REGULAR AND IMPERATIVE A PART OF THE APOSTOLIC MINISTRY AS THE DUTIES WHICH THEY EXERCISED IN PREACHING BAPTIZING ORDAINING ET CETERA
3925-57660-0009 HENCE THE SUCCESSORS OF THE APOSTLES IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAVE PRECISELY THE SAME AUTHORITY AND OBLIGATION TO CONFIRM AS THEY HAVE TO PREACH TO BAPTIZE OR TO ORDAIN THOSE WHO WERE CONFIRMED BY THE APOSTLES
3925-57660-0010 USUALLY GAVE EVIDENCE OF THE GRACE WHICH THEY RECEIVED BY PROPHECY THE GIFT OF TONGUES AND THE MANIFESTATION OF OTHER MIRACULOUS POWERS IT MAY BE ASKED WHY DO NOT THESE GIFTS ACCOMPANY NOW THE IMPOSITION OF HANDS I ANSWER
3925-57660-0011 THE GRACE WHICH THE APOSTOLIC DISCIPLES RECEIVED WAS FOR THEIR PERSONAL SANCTIFICATION THE GIFT OF TONGUES WHICH THEY EXERCISED WAS INTENDED BY ALMIGHTY GOD TO EDIFY AND ENLIGHTEN THE SPECTATORS
3925-57660-0012 AND TO GIVE DIVINE SANCTION TO THE APOSTOLIC MINISTRY BUT NOW THAT THE CHURCH IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AND THE DIVINE AUTHORITY OF HER MINISTRY IS CLEARLY RECOGNIZED THESE MIRACLES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY
3925-57660-0013 SAINT GREGORY ILLUSTRATES THIS POINT BY A HAPPY COMPARISON AS THE SAPLING HE SAYS WHEN IT IS FIRST PLANTED IS REGULARLY WATERED BY THE GARDENER WHO SOFTENS THE EARTH AROUND IT THAT THE SUN AND THE MOISTURE
3925-57660-0014 MAY NOURISH ITS ROOTS UNTIL IT TAKES DEEP ROOT AND IT NO LONGER REQUIRES ANY SPECIAL CARE SO THE CHURCH IN HER INFANCY HAD TO BE NOURISHED BY THE MIRACULOUS POWER OF GOD
3925-57660-0015 BUT AFTER IT HAD TAKEN ROOT IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE AND SPREAD ITS BRANCHES OVER THE EARTH IT WAS LEFT TO THE ORDINARY AGENCIES OF PROVIDENCE SAINT AUGUSTINE WRITES ALSO ON THE SAME SUBJECT IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THE CHURCH
3925-57660-0016 THE HOLY GHOST CAME DOWN ON BELIEVERS AND THEY SPOKE IN TONGUES WHICH THEY HAD NOT LEARNED THESE WERE MIRACLES SUITED TO THE TIMES IS IT NOW EXPECTED THAT THEY UPON WHOM HANDS ARE LAID SHOULD SPEAK WITH TONGUES
3925-57660-0017 AND PROCLAIMING ITS SALUTARY EFFECTS THE FLESH SAYS TERTULLIAN IS ANOINTED THAT THE SOUL MAY BE CONSECRATED THE FLESH IS MARKED
3925-57660-0018 THAT WAS DONE BY PETER AND JOHN THAT PRAYER BEING MADE FOR THEM AND HANDS IMPOSED THE HOLY GHOST SHOULD BE INVOKED AND POURED FORTH UPON THEM WHICH NOW ALSO IS DONE AMONGST US
3925-57660-0019 SO THAT THEY WHO ARE BAPTIZED IN THE CHURCH ARE PRESENTED TO THE BISHOPS OF THE CHURCH AND BY OUR PRAYER AND IMPOSITION OF HANDS
3925-57660-0020 COMPARES THE SACRED CHRISM IN CONFIRMATION TO THE EUCHARIST YOU WERE ANOINTED WITH OIL BEING MADE SHARERS AND PARTNERS OF CHRIST AND SEE WELL THAT YOU REGARD IT NOT AS MERE OINTMENT FOR AS THE BREAD OF THE EUCHARIST
3925-57660-0021 AFTER THE INVOCATION OF THE HOLY GHOST IS NO LONGER MERE BREAD BUT THE BODY OF CHRIST SO LIKEWISE THIS HOLY OINTMENT IS NO LONGER COMMON OINTMENT AFTER THE INVOCATION BUT THE GIFT OF CHRIST AND OF THE HOLY GHOST
3925-57660-0022 BEING RENDERED EFFICIENT BY HIS DIVINITY YOU WERE ANOINTED ON THE FOREHEAD THAT YOU MIGHT BE DELIVERED FROM THE SHAME WHICH THE FIRST TRANSGRESSOR ALWAYS EXPERIENCED AND THAT YOU MIGHT CONTEMPLATE THE GLORY OF GOD WITH AN UNVEILED COUNTENANCE
3925-57660-0023 AS CHRIST AFTER HIS BAPTISM AND THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST UPON HIM
3925-57660-0024 SO YOU LIKEWISE AFTER HOLY BAPTISM AND THE MYSTERIOUS UNCTION CLOTHED WITH THE PANOPLY OF THE HOLY GHOST
3925-57660-0025 REMEMBER HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE SPIRITUAL SEAL THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING THE SPIRIT OF COUNSEL AND FORTITUDE THE SPIRIT OF KNOWLEDGE AND PIETY
3925-57660-0026 NOW SOME OF THESE CHURCHES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SINCE THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES THIS FACT IS AN ELOQUENT VINDICATION OF THE APOSTOLIC ANTIQUITY OF CONFIRMATION
3925-57660-0027 AND IS AN AMPLE REFUTATION OF THOSE WHO WOULD ASCRIBE TO IT A MORE RECENT ORIGIN PROTESTANTISM WHICH MADE SUCH HAVOC OF THE OTHER SACRAMENTS DID NOT FAIL TO ABOLISH CONFIRMATION IN ITS SWEEPING REVOLUTION THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH RETAINS INDEED
3925-57660-0028 THE NAME OF CONFIRMATION IN ITS RITUAL AND EVEN BORROWS A PORTION OF OUR PRAYERS AND CEREMONIAL BUT IN OPPOSITION TO THE UNIFORM TEACHING OF THE CATHOLIC AS WELL AS OF ALL THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES BOTH ORTHODOX AND SCHISMATIC
3925-57660-0029 IT DECLARES CONFIRMATION TO BE A MERE RITE AND NOT A SACRAMENT IN VIOLATION OF THE PRACTICE OF ALL ANTIQUITY IT MUTILATES THE RITE BY OMITTING THE SACRED UNCTION IT RETAINS THE SHADOW WITHOUT THE SUBSTANCE
3925-57660-0030 IT RAISES INDEED ITS HANDS OVER THE CANDIDATES BUT THEY ARE NOT THE ANOINTED HANDS OF PETER OR JOHN OR CYPRIAN OR AUGUSTINE TO WHOM IT IS SAID WHATSOEVER THOU SHALT BLESS LET IT BE BLESSED
