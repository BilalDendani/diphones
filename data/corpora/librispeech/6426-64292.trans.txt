6426-64292-0000 ANOTHER CHANGE FOR SOME TIME TOM MADE PROGRESS TOWARD HEALTH AND WAS ABLE TO READ A GOOD PART OF THE DAY
6426-64292-0001 HE WAS FOND OF MUSIC AND FONDER STILL OF CRITICISM UPON ANYTHING
6426-64292-0002 WHEN HE HAD DONE WITH JOSEPH OR WHEN HE DID NOT WANT HIM MARY WAS ALWAYS READY TO GIVE THE LATTER A LESSON AND HAD HE BEEN A LESS GIFTED MAN THAN HE WAS HE COULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO MAKE PROGRESS WITH SUCH A TEACHER
6426-64292-0003 NOT TO SAY NO WOMAN COULD HAVE FAILED TO BE PLEASED AT THE THOROUGH PAINSTAKING WITH WHICH HE FOLLOWED THE SLIGHTEST OF HER HINTS AND THE DELIGHT HIS FLUSHED FACE WOULD REVEAL WHEN SHE PRAISED THE SUCCESS HE HAD ACHIEVED
6426-64292-0004 FOR THE PERIOD OF QUIESCENCE AS TO PRODUCTION WHICH FOLLOWED THE INITIATION OF MORE ORDERLY STUDY WAS AFTER ALL BUT OF SHORT DURATION AND THE RETURN TIDE OF MUSICAL UTTERANCE WAS STRONGER THAN EVER
6426-64292-0005 MARY'S DELIGHT WAS GREAT WHEN FIRST HE BROUGHT HER ONE OF HIS COMPOSITIONS VERY FAIRLY WRITTEN OUT AFTER WHICH OTHERS FOLLOWED WITH A RAPIDITY THAT ASTONISHED HER THEY ENABLED HER ALSO TO UNDERSTAND THE MAN BETTER AND BETTER
6426-64292-0006 FOR TO HAVE A THING TO BROOD OVER WHICH WE ARE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING MUST BE MORE TO US THAN EVEN THE MASTER'S PLAYING OF IT
6426-64292-0007 BY WHICH ALONE THE SOUL MOST GLORIOUS IN GLADNESS OR ANY OTHER THE STUPIDEST OF SOULS CAN LIVE TO THE FIRST HE BROUGHT HER SHE CONTRIVED TO PUT A POOR LITTLE FAULTY ACCOMPANIMENT AND WHEN SHE PLAYED HIS AIR TO HIM SO ACCOMPANIED
6426-64292-0008 HIS DELIGHT WAS TOUCHING AND NOT A LITTLE AMUSING PLAINLY HE THOUGHT THE ACCOMPANIMENT A TRIUMPH OF HUMAN FACULTY AND BEYOND ANYTHING HE COULD EVER DEVELOP NEVER PUPIL WAS MORE HUMBLE NEVER PUPIL MORE OBEDIENT
6426-64292-0009 THINKING NOTHING OF HIMSELF OR OF ANYTHING HE HAD DONE OR COULD DO HIS PATH WAS OPEN TO THE SWIFTEST AND HIGHEST GROWTH IT MATTERS LITTLE WHERE A MAN MAY BE AT THIS MOMENT THE POINT IS WHETHER HE IS GROWING
6426-64292-0010 THE NEXT POINT WILL BE WHETHER HE IS GROWING AT THE RATIO GIVEN HIM
6426-64292-0011 WHAT THE GIFT OF SUCH AN INSTRUCTOR WAS TO JOSEPH MY READER MAY BE REQUESTED TO IMAGINE
6426-64292-0012 HE WAS LIKE A MAN SEATED ON THE GRASS OUTSIDE THE HEAVENLY GATE FROM WHICH SLOW OPENING EVERY EVENING AS THE SUN WENT DOWN CAME AN ANGEL TO TEACH AND TEACH UNTIL HE TOO SHOULD BE FIT TO ENTER IN AN HOUR WOULD ARRIVE WHEN SHE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE TO COME OUT TO HIM WHERE HE SAT
6426-64292-0013 UNDER SUCH AN INFLUENCE ALL THAT WAS GENTLEST AND SWEETEST IN HIS NATURE MIGHT WELL DEVELOP WITH RAPIDITY AND EVERY ACCIDENTAL ROUGHNESS AND IN HIM THERE WAS NO OTHER BY SWIFT DEGREES VANISH FROM BOTH SPEECH AND MANNERS
6426-64292-0014 THE ANGELS DO NOT WANT TAILORS TO MAKE THEIR CLOTHES THEIR HABITS COME OUT OF THEMSELVES BUT WE ARE OFTEN TOO HARD UPON OUR FELLOWS FOR MANY OF THOSE IN THE HIGHER RANKS OF LIFE NO NO I MEAN OF SOCIETY
6426-64292-0015 OF SUCH A NOBILITY GOOD LORD DELIVER US FROM ALL ENVY AS TO FALLING IN LOVE WITH A LADY LIKE MARY SUCH A THING WAS AS FAR FROM JASPER'S CONSCIOUSNESS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A DUCHESS SHE BELONGED TO ANOTHER WORLD FROM HIS
6426-64292-0016 A WORLD WHICH HIS WORLD WORSHIPED WAITING HE MIGHT MISS HER EVEN TO DEATH HER ABSENCE MIGHT FOR HIM DARKEN THE UNIVERSE AS IF THE SUN HAD WITHDRAWN HIS BRIGHTNESS
6426-64292-0017 BUT WHO THINKS OF FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE SUN OR DREAMS OF CLIMBING NEARER TO HIS RADIANCE THE DAY WILL ONE DAY COME OR WHAT OF THE LONG PROMISED KINGDOM OF HEAVEN WHEN A WOMAN INSTEAD OF SPENDING ANXIOUS THOUGHT ON THE ADORNMENT OF HER OWN OUTWARD PERSON WILL SEEK WITH MIGHT THE ADORNMENT OF THE INWARD SOUL OF ANOTHER AND WILL MAKE THAT HER CROWN OF REJOICING
6426-64292-0018 OUTGOING LOVE TO BUILD SPIRITUAL HOUSES LIKE SAINT PAUL A HIGHER ART THAN ANY OF MAN'S INVENTION O MY BROTHER WHAT WERE IT NOT FOR THEE TO HAVE A HAND IN MAKING THY BROTHER BEAUTIFUL BE NOT INDIGNANT MY READER
6426-64292-0019 NOT FOR A MOMENT DID I IMAGINE THEE CAPABLE OF SUCH A MEAN CALLING IT IS LEFT TO A CERTAIN SCHOOL OF WEAK ENTHUSIASTS WHO BELIEVE THAT SUCH GROWTH SUCH EMBELLISHMENT SUCH CREATION IS ALL GOD CARES ABOUT
6426-64292-0020 THERE SOON CAME A CHANGE HOWEVER AND THE LESSONS CEASED ALTOGETHER TOM HAD COME DOWN TO HIS OLD QUARTERS AND IN THE ARROGANCE OF CONVALESCENCE HAD PRESUMED ON HIS IMAGINED STRENGTH AND SO CAUGHT COLD
6426-64292-0021 AN ALARMING RELAPSE WAS THE CONSEQUENCE AND THERE WAS NO MORE PLAYING
6426-64292-0022 FOR NOW HIS CONDITION BEGAN TO DRAW TO A CHANGE OF WHICH FOR SOME TIME NONE OF THEM HAD EVEN THOUGHT THE PATIENT HAD SEEMED SO CERTAINLY RECOVERING THE COLD SETTLED ON HIS LUNGS AND HE SANK RAPIDLY
6426-64292-0023 JOSEPH WHOSE VIOLIN WAS USELESS NOW WAS NOT THE LESS IN ATTENDANCE EVERY EVENING WHEN HIS WORK WAS OVER HE CAME KNOCKING GENTLY AT THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR AND NEVER LEFT UNTIL TOM WAS SETTLED FOR THE NIGHT
6426-64292-0024 THE MOST SILENTLY HELPFUL UNDEMONSTRATIVE BEING HE WAS THAT DOCTOR COULD DESIRE TO WAIT UPON PATIENT WHEN IT WAS HIS TURN TO WATCH HE NEVER CLOSED AN EYE BUT AT DAYBREAK FOR IT WAS NOW SPRING
6426-64292-0025 WOULD ROUSE MARY AND GO OFF STRAIGHT TO HIS WORK NOR TASTE FOOD UNTIL THE HOUR FOR THE MID DAY MEAL ARRIVED TOM SPEEDILY BECAME AWARE THAT HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED PHRASE OF UNBELIEF FOR ARE THEY NOT NUMBERED FROM THE BEGINNING
6426-64292-0026 ARE OUR HAIRS NUMBERED AND OUR DAYS FORGOTTEN TILL DEATH GIVES A HINT TO THE DOCTOR HE WAS SORRY FOR HIS PAST LIFE AND THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF MUCH OF IT
6426-64292-0027 SAYING IN ALL HONESTY HE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN FALL FOR ONE SOLITARY WEEK INTO THE OLD WAYS NOT THAT HE WISHED TO DIE FOR WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH HE DID NOT BELIEVE HE COULD FALL INTO THE OLD WAYS AGAIN
6426-64292-0028 FOR MY PART I THINK HE WAS TAKEN AWAY TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE OF THAT CARE AND NURSING WHICH NEITHER HIS MOTHER NOR HIS WIFE HAD BEEN WOMAN ENOUGH TO GIVE THE GREAT BABY AFTER ALL HE HAD NOT BEEN ONE OF THE WORST OF BABIES
6426-64292-0029 IS IT STRANGE THAT ONE SO USED TO BAD COMPANY AND BAD WAYS SHOULD HAVE SO ALTERED IN SO SHORT A TIME AND WITHOUT ANY GREAT STRUGGLE
6426-64292-0030 THE ASSURANCE OF DEATH AT THE DOOR AND A WHOLESOME SHAME OF THINGS THAT ARE PAST MAY I THINK LEAD UP TO SUCH A SWIFT CHANGE EVEN IN A MUCH WORSE MAN THAN TOM
6426-64292-0031 FOR THERE IS THE LIFE ITSELF ALL SURROUNDING AND EVER PRESSING IN UPON THE HUMAN SOUL WHEREVER THAT SOUL WILL AFFORD A CHINK OF ENTRANCE AND TOM HAD NOT YET SEALED UP ALL HIS DOORS WHEN HE LAY THERE DEAD
6426-64292-0032 FOR WHAT EXCUSE COULD WE HAVE FOR FOOLISH LAMENTATION IF WE DID NOT SPEAK OF THE LOVED AS LYING DEAD
6426-64292-0033 NOR DID THE FIREFLY SPARE ITS DOLE OF HOMAGE TO THE MEMORY OF ONE OF ITS GAYEST WRITERS INDEED ALL ABOUT ITS OFFICE HAD LOVED HIM EACH AFTER HIS FACULTY EVEN THE BOY CRIED WHEN HE HEARD HE WAS GONE FOR TO HIM TOO HE HAD ALWAYS GIVEN A KIND WORD COMING AND GOING
6426-64292-0034 A CERTAIN LITTLE RUNNEL OF VERSE FLOWED NO MORE THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE FIREFLY AND IN A MONTH THERE WAS NOT THE SHADOW OF TOM UPON HIS AGE BUT THE PRINT OF HIM WAS DEEP IN THE HEART OF LETTY AND NOT SHALLOW IN THE AFFECTION OF MARY
6426-64292-0035 NOR WERE SUCH AS THESE INSIGNIFICANT RECORDS FOR ANY ONE TO LEAVE BEHIND HIM AS RECORDS GO HAPPY WAS HE TO HAVE LEFT BEHIND HIM ANY LOVE ESPECIALLY SUCH A LOVE AS LETTY BORE HIM FOR WHAT IS THE LOUDEST PRAISE OF POSTERITY TO THE QUIETEST LOVE OF ONE'S OWN GENERATION
6426-64292-0036 FOR HIS MOTHER HER MEMORY WAS MOSTLY IN HER TEMPER SHE HAD NEVER UNDERSTOOD HER WAYWARD CHILD JUST BECAUSE SHE HAD GIVEN HIM HER WAYWARDNESS
6426-64292-0037 WHEN SHE HEARD OF HIS DEATH SHE HOWLED AND CURSED HER FATE AND THE WOMAN MEANING POOR LETTY
6426-64292-0038 BUT WHAT WAS MARY TO DO NOW WITH LETTY SHE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A BABY YET NOT SILLY FROM YOUTH BUT YOUNG FROM SILLINESS CHILDREN MUST LEARN TO WALK BUT NOT BY BEING TURNED OUT ALONE IN CHEAPSIDE
6426-64292-0039 FOR TEN PERSONS WILL REPENT OF A SIN FOR ONE WHO WILL CONFESS IT I DO NOT MEAN TO THE PRIEST THAT MAY BE AN EASY MATTER BUT TO THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A CLAIM TO THE CONFESSION
6426-64292-0040 NAMELY THE PERSON WRONGED YET SUCH CONFESSION IS IN TRUTH FAR MORE NEEDFUL TO THE WRONGER THAN TO THE WRONGED IT IS A SMALL THING TO BE WRONGED BUT A HORRIBLE THING TO WRONG THE LETTER CONTAINED A POVERTY STRICKEN EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY
