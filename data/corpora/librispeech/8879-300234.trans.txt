8879-300234-0000 THE DESCENT OF THE FRASER RIVER AMERICAN TRADERS WERE NOT SLOW TO FOLLOW UP THE DISCOVERY OF ROBERT GRAY ON THE PACIFIC
8879-300234-0001 HAD CEDED LOUISIANA TO FRANCE AND FRANCE BY WAY OF CHECKMATING BRITISH ADVANCE IN NORTH AMERICA HAD SOLD LOUISIANA TO THE UNITED STATES FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
8879-300234-0002 CERTAINLY FROM NEW ORLEANS TO THE MISSOURI DID IT ALSO INCLUDE FROM THE MISSOURI TO GRAY'S RIVER THE COLUMBIA THE UNITED STATES HAD SENT MERIWETHER LEWIS AND WILLIAM CLARK OVERLAND FROM THE MISSOURI TO THE COLUMBIA
8879-300234-0003 OSTENSIBLY ON A SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION BUT IN REALITY TO LAY CLAIM TO THE NEW TERRITORY FOR THE UNITED STATES THIS BRINGS THE EXPLORATION OF THE PACIFIC DOWN TO EIGHTEEN O SIX TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP
8879-300234-0004 MACKENZIE HAD CROSSED OVERLAND FROM THE PEACE RIVER TO BELLA COOLA
8879-300234-0005 A THIRD LARGER THAN GERMANY BETWEEN MACKENZIE'S TRAIL WESTWARD AND LEWIS AND CLARK'S TRAIL TO THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA IN EIGHTEEN O FIVE SIMON FRASER
8879-300234-0006 WHO AS A CHILD HAD COME FROM THE UNITED STATES TO CANADA WITH HIS WIDOWED MOTHER IN THE LOYALIST MIGRATION AND NOW IN HIS THIRTIETH YEAR WAS A PARTNER IN THE NORTH WEST COMPANY OF MONTREAL HAD CROSSED THE ROCKIES BY WAY OF THE PEACE RIVER
8879-300234-0007 HE HAD FOLLOWED MACKENZIE'S TRAIL OVER THE TERRIBLE NINE MILE CARRYING PLACE AND HAD BUILT THERE A FUR POST ROCKY MOUNTAIN PORTAGE HE HAD ASCENDED THAT SAME PARSNIP RIVER WHICH MACKENZIE HAD FOUND SO APPALLING
8879-300234-0008 AND DURING THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN O SIX M'DOUGALL HAD CROSSED THE HEAVILY DRIFTED CARRYING PLACE AND DESCENDED THE BAD RIVER AS FAR AS THE SOUTH FORK OF THE FRASER WHICH ALL TRADERS AT THAT TIME MISTOOK FOR THE UPPER REACHES OF GRAY'S COLUMBIA
8879-300234-0009 AND IF HE DID NOT ACTUALLY BEHOLD THE BEAUTIFUL ALPINE TARNS SINCE KNOWN AS FRASER LAKE AND STUART LAKE HE WAS AT LEAST THE FIRST WHITE MAN TO HEAR OF THEM IN MAY OF EIGHTEEN O SIX
8879-300234-0010 AFTER SENDING THE YEAR'S FURS FROM ROCKY MOUNTAIN PORTAGE EAST TO FORT CHIPEWYAN SIMON FRASER SET OUT TO EXPLORE THIS INLAND EMPIRE CONCERNING WHICH M'DOUGALL HAD REPORTED JOHN STUART ACCOMPANIED FRASER AS LIEUTENANT
8879-300234-0011 THEY CROSSED FROM THE HEAD WATERS OF THE PARSNIP TO THE SOUTH FORK OF THE FRASER
8879-300234-0012 TOWARDS THE END OF JULY THE CARRIERS CAMPED ON STUART LAKE WERE AMAZED TO SEE ADVANCING ACROSS THE WATERS WITH RHYTHMIC GALLOP OF PADDLES TWO ENORMOUS BIRCH CANOES
8879-300234-0013 THEY THOUGHT THE WHITE MEN IN SMOKING WERE EMITTING SPIRITS WITH EACH BREATH WHEN THE TRADERS OFFERED SOAP TO THE SQUAWS THE WOMEN AT ONCE BEGAN TO DEVOUR IT
8879-300234-0014 HISTORY DOES NOT RECORD WHETHER THE WOMEN BECAME AS ADDICTED TO SOAP AS THE MEN TO THE FRAGRANT WEED ACTIVE TRADING WITH THE INDIANS BEGAN AT ONCE THE LAKE WAS NAMED STUART IN HONOUR OF FRASER'S COMPANION
8879-300234-0015 AND THE GROUND WAS CLEARED FOR A PALISADED FORT WHICH WHEN ERECTED THEY NAMED FORT SAINT JAMES THE SCENE WAS ENCHANTING THE LAKE WOUND FOR A DISTANCE OF FIFTY MILES AMID THE FOOT HILLS OF THE MIGHTY FORESTED MOUNTAINS
8879-300234-0016 IT WAS FOUR OR FIVE MILES WIDE AND WAS GEMMED WITH GREEN ISLETS AND ALL ROUND APPEARING THROUGH THE CLOUDS IN JAGGED OUTLINE WERE THE OPAL SUMMITS OF THE SNOWY PEAKS
8879-300234-0017 NO WONDER THE TWO SCOTSMEN NAMED THE NEW INLAND EMPIRE NEW CALEDONIA AFTER THEIR NATIVE LAND IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT M'DOUGALL HAD HEARD OF ANOTHER MOUNTAIN TARN THIS WAS FORTY MILES SOUTH OF STUART LAKE
8879-300234-0018 AT THE HEADWATERS OF THE NECHACO THE NORTH FORK OF THE FRASER STUART WENT OVERLAND SOUTH TO SPY OUT THE SOUTHERN LAKE AND HIS REPORT WAS OF SUCH AN ENTRANCING REGION HEAVILY FORESTED WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GAME AND FISH
8879-300234-0019 AGAIN A FORT WAS ERECTED AND NAMED FORT FRASER MAKING THREE FORTS IN THE INTERIOR OF NEW CALEDONIA FRASER HAD SENT A REQUEST TO THE DIRECTORS OF THE NORTH WEST COMPANY TO BE PERMITTED
8879-300234-0020 TO FIT OUT AN EXPEDITION DOWN THE GREAT RIVER WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS THE COLUMBIA AND IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN O SEVEN TWO CANOES UNDER JULES QUESNEL WERE SENT OUT WITH GOODS
8879-300234-0021 QUESNEL ARRIVED AT FORT SAINT JAMES IN THE AUTUMN BRINGING FROM THE EAST THE ALARMING WORD THAT LEWIS AND CLARK HAD GONE OVERLAND AND TAKEN POSSESSION OF ALL THE TERRITORY BETWEEN THE MISSOURI AND THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA
8879-300234-0022 NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST BY FRASER IN ESTABLISHING A CLAIM TO THE REGION TO THE WEST OF THE ROCKIES BETWEEN THE PEACE AND THE COLUMBIA FRASER WENT DOWN THE RIVER AND STRENGTHENED BRITISH POSSESSION BY BUILDING A FOURTH FORT
8879-300234-0023 FORT GEORGE AT THE MOUTH OF THE NECHACO THIS WAS TO BE THE STARTING POINT OF THE EXPEDITION TO THE PACIFIC
8879-300234-0024 WE RESOLVED TO VENTURE DOWN I ORDERED THE FIVE BEST MEN OF THE CREWS INTO A CANOE LIGHTLY LOADED AND IN A MOMENT IT WAS UNDER WAY AFTER PASSING THE FIRST CASCADE SHE LOST HER HEAD AND WAS DRAWN INTO AN EDDY
8879-300234-0025 WHERE SHE WAS WHIRLED ABOUT IN SUSPENSE WHETHER TO SINK OR SWIM HOWEVER SHE TOOK A TURN FROM THIS VORTEX FLYING FROM ONE DANGER TO ANOTHER
8879-300234-0026 THE WHIRLPOOL FORCED HER AGAINST A LOW ROCK UPON THIS THE MEN SCRAMBLED OUT SAVING THEIR LIVES
8879-300234-0027 TO CONTINUE BY WATER WOULD BE CERTAIN DESTRUCTION DURING THIS DISTRESSING SCENE WE WERE ON SHORE LOOKING ON BUT THE SITUATION RENDERED OUR APPROACH PERILOUS THE BANK WAS HIGH AND STEEP
8879-300234-0028 WE HAD TO PLUNGE OUR DAGGERS INTO THE GROUND TO AVOID SLIDING INTO THE RIVER WE CUT STEPS FASTENED A LINE TO THE FRONT OF THE CANOE AND HAULED IT UP OUR LIVES HUNG UPON A THREAD AS ONE FALSE STEP MIGHT HAVE HURLED US INTO ETERNITY
8879-300234-0029 HOWEVER WE CLEARED THE BANK BEFORE DARK THE MEN HAD TO ASCEND THE IMMENSE HILLS WITH HEAVY LOADS ON THEIR BACKS INDIANS WARNED THE WHITE MEN TO DESIST FROM THEIR UNDERTAKING
8879-300234-0030 BETTER THEY ADVISED GO OVERLAND EASTWARD TO A GREAT PEACEFUL RIVER AND DESCEND THAT TO THE SEA FRASER OF COURSE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE PEACEFUL RIVER THEY SPOKE OF WAS REALLY THE COLUMBIA HE THOUGHT THE RIVER HE WAS FOLLOWING
8879-300234-0031 WAS THE COLUMBIA WITH THE HELP OF INDIANS THE CANOES WERE PULLED UP HILL AND HORSES WERE HIRED FROM THEM TO CARRY THE PROVISIONS OVERLAND BELOW THIS PORTAGE AS THEY CONTINUED THE DESCENT
8879-300234-0032 APPEARING AT FIRST TO BAR THE PASSAGE AHEAD THIS WAS BAR ROCK BEYOND IT SEVERAL MINOR RAPIDS WERE PASSED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THEN THEY CAME UPON A SERIES OF GREAT WHIRLPOOLS WHICH SEEMED IMPASSABLE
8879-300234-0033 BUT THE MEN UNLOADED THE CANOES AND
8879-300234-0034 UNDERTAKING' RAN THEM DOWN THE RAPIDS WITH LIGHT BALLAST THEY THEN CAME BACK OVERLAND FOR THE PACKS THIS TASK SAYS FRASER WAS AS DANGEROUS AS GOING BY WATER
8879-300234-0035 THE MEN PASSED AND REPASSED A DECLIVITY ON LOOSE STONES AND GRAVEL WHICH CONSTANTLY GAVE WAY UNDER FOOT ONE MAN WHO LOST THE PATH GOT IN A MOST INTRICATE AND PERILOUS POSITION
8879-300234-0036 WITH A LARGE PACKAGE ON HIS BACK HE GOT SO WEDGED AMID THE ROCKS THAT HE COULD MOVE NEITHER FORWARD NOR BACKWARD NOR YET UNLOAD HIMSELF I CRAWLED NOT WITHOUT GREAT RISK TO HIS ASSISTANCE
8879-300234-0037 AND SAVED HIS LIFE BY CUTTING HIS PACK SO THAT IT DROPPED BACK IN THE RIVER ON THIS CARRYING PLACE WHICH WAS TWO MILES LONG OUR SHOES BECAME SHATTERED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THIS
8879-300234-0038 THE ADVANCE WAS BY A SUCCESSION OF RAPIDS AND PORTAGES
8879-300234-0039 AND SWEPT VIOLENTLY BETWEEN TWO OVERHANGING PRECIPICES THE WATER WHICH ROLLS DOWN THIS PASSAGE IN TUMULTUOUS WAVES AND WITH GREAT VELOCITY HAD A FRIGHTFUL APPEARANCE
8879-300234-0040 HOWEVER IT BEING ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY CANOES BY LAND ALL HANDS WITHOUT HESITATION EMBARKED ON THE MERCY OF THE AWFUL TIDE ONCE ON THE WATER THE DIE WAS CAST
8879-300234-0041 AND THE DIFFICULTY CONSISTED IN KEEPING THE CANOES CLEAR OF THE PRECIPICE ON ONE SIDE AND CLEAR OF THE GULFS FORMED BY THE WAVES ON THE OTHER THUS SKIMMING ALONG AS FAST AS LIGHTNING THE CREWS COOL AND DETERMINED
8879-300234-0042 FOLLOWED EACH OTHER IN AWFUL SILENCE AND WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE END WE STOOD GAZING AT EACH OTHER IN SILENT CONGRATULATION ON OUR NARROW ESCAPE FROM TOTAL DESTRUCTION AFTER BREATHING A LITTLE WE CONTINUED OUR COURSE TO THE POINT
8879-300234-0043 WHERE THE INDIANS CAMPED THE NATIVES HERE WARNED FRASER THAT IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO GO FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME THEY FURNISHED HIM WITH A GUIDE
8879-300234-0044 THE SAME EVENING THE PARTY REACHED THE PLACE DESCRIBED BY FRASER AS A CONTINUAL SERIES OF CASCADES CUT BY ROCKS AND BOUNDED BY PRECIPICES
8879-300234-0045 AN EXAMINATION OF THE RIVER FOR SOME DISTANCE BELOW CONVINCED FRASER THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE OF NAVIGATION AND HE DECIDED TO MAKE THE REMAINDER OF THE JOURNEY ON FOOT AFTER BUILDING A SCAFFOLD ON WHICH THE CANOES AND SOME PROVISIONS WERE PLACED
8879-300234-0046 AND COVERED WITH UNDERBRUSH AND MOSS THE PARTY ON JUNE ELEVENTH BEGAN THEIR TRAMP DOWN THE RIVER BANK EACH MAN CARRIED ON HIS BACK A NINETY POUND PACK SUPPORTED BY A STRAP ACROSS THE FOREHEAD
8879-300234-0047 AGAIN AND AGAIN ON THE JOURNEY INDIANS CONFRONTED FRASER WITH HOSTILE SHOW OF WEAPONS BUT THE INTREPID TRADER DISARMED HOSTILITY BY GIFTS
8879-300234-0048 THE INDIANS DECLARED THAT THE SEA LAY ONLY TEN SLEEPS DISTANT ONE OF THE CHIEFS SAID THAT HE HAD HIMSELF SEEN WHITE MEN WHO WERE GREAT TYEES BECAUSE
8879-300234-0049 CLAPPING HIS HANDS TO HIS HIPS AND STRUTTING ABOUT WITH AN AIR OF VAST IMPORTANCE THE INDIANS TOLD FRASER OF ANOTHER GREAT RIVER THAT CAME IN FROM THE EAST AND JOINED THIS ONE SOME DISTANCE BELOW HE HAD PASSED THE SITE OF THE PRESENT
8879-300234-0050 FARTHER DOWN EUROPEAN ARTICLES WERE SEEN AMONG THE INDIANS IT WAS THE FISHING SEASON AND THE TRIBES HAD ASSEMBLED IN GREAT HORDES HERE THE RIVER WAS NAVIGABLE AND THREE WOODEN DUG OUTS WERE OBTAINED FROM THE NATIVES FOR THE DESCENT TO THE SEA
8879-300234-0051 THE VOYAGEURS AGAIN EMBARKED AND SWEPT DOWN THE NARROW BENDS OF THE TURBULENT FLOODS AT WHAT ARE NOW LYTTON YALE AND HOPE THERE WERE PASSES WHERE THE RIVER WAS SUCH A RAGING TORRENT
8879-300234-0052 THERE WERE PLACES WHERE FRASER'S VOYAGEURS HAD TO CLIMB PRECIPICES BY MEANS OF FRAIL LADDERS
8879-300234-0053 WHEN THE RIVER TURNED SHARPLY WEST FRASER COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT THE INDIANS BECAME MORE VIOLENTLY HOSTILE FAR SOUTH COULD BE SEEN THE OPAL DOME OF MOUNT BAKER NAMED BY VANCOUVER AFTER ONE OF HIS LIEUTENANTS
8879-300234-0054 WHAT TROUBLED FRASER MOST WAS THE FACT THAT THE RIVER LAY MANY MILES NORTH OF THE KNOWN LATITUDE OF THE COLUMBIA
8879-300234-0055 POSSIBLY BE THE COLUMBIA THE TIDE ROSE AND FELL IN THE RIVER THE INDIAN GUIDE BEGGED THE WHITE MEN NOT TO GO ON HE WAS AFRAID HE SAID OF THE INDIANS OF THE SEA COAST THE RIVER CHANNEL DIVIDED
8879-300234-0056 NATIVES ALONG THE SHORE BEGAN SINGING WAR SONGS AND BEATING THE WAR DRUM THEN THEY CIRCLED OUT THREATENINGLY ROUND THE WHITE MEN'S BOATS SIGNS WERE SEEN OF THE SEA AHEAD
8879-300234-0057 BUT THE INDIANS WERE HOWLING LIKE WOLVES AND BRANDISHING WAR CLUBS AND FRASER CONCLUDED
8879-300234-0058 THIS RIVER IS THEREFORE NOT THE COLUMBIA HE DECLARED IF I HAD BEEN CONVINCED OF THIS WHEN I LEFT MY CANOES I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE RETURNED THE RETURN JOURNEY WAS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER ALWAYS ONE MAN STOOD GUARD
8879-300234-0059 WHILE THE OTHERS SLEPT AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE LITTLE PARTY WAS SURROUNDED BY FEROCIOUSLY HOSTILE BANDS BETWEEN APPREHENSION OF THE DANGERS OF THE WILD TRAIL OF THE FRASER CANYONS AND FEAR OF HOSTILE NATIVES THE MEN BECAME SO PANIC STRICKEN
8879-300234-0060 THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS FRASER REASONED AND REMONSTRATED AND FINALLY THREATENED AFTER SO MUCH HEROISM HE WOULD NOT PERMIT COWARDLY DESERTION THEN HE FORCED EACH VOYAGEUR TO SWEAR ON THE CROSS
8879-300234-0061 I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT I WILL SOONER PERISH THAN FORSAKE IN DISTRESS ANY OF OUR CREW DURING THE PRESENT VOYAGE WITH RENEWED SELF RESPECT THEY THEN PADDLED OFF SINGING VOYAGEURS SONGS TO KEEP UP THEIR COURAGE
8879-300234-0062 IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THE SCENE THE TURBID MAD WATERS OF THE FRASER HEMMED IN BETWEEN ROCK WALLS CARVING A LIVING WAY THROUGH THE ADAMANT BANKS FROM WHICH RED SAVAGES THREW DOWN ROCKS
8879-300234-0063 WHEREVER THE WILD CURRENT DROVE THE DUG OUT INSHORE AND TOSSED BY THE WAVES A CHIP LIKE CRAFT CONTAINING NINETEEN RAGGED MEN SINGING LIKE SCHOOLBOYS ONCE AWAY FROM THE COASTAL TRIBES HOWEVER
8879-300234-0064 THE WHITE MEN WERE AIDED BY THE INLAND CARRIERS THEY FOUND THE CANOES AND SUPPLIES IN PERFECT CONDITION AND UNMOLESTED
