6673-72311-0000 IN THE LAND'S END DISTRICT IS THE LITTLE CHURCH TOWN OF ZENNOR THERE IS NO VILLAGE TO SPEAK OF A FEW SCATTERED FARMS AND HERE AND THERE A CLUSTER OF COTTAGES THE DISTRICT IS BLEAK
6673-72311-0001 THE SOIL DOES NOT LIE DEEP OVER GRANITE THAT PEERS THROUGH THE SURFACE ON EXPOSED SPOTS WHERE THE FURIOUS GALES FROM THE OCEAN SWEEP THE LAND IF TREES EVER EXISTED THERE THEY HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE BLAST
6673-72311-0002 BUT THE GOLDEN FURZE OR GORSE DEFIES ALL WINDS AND CLOTHES THE MOORLAND WITH A ROBE OF SPLENDOUR AND THE HEATHER FLUSHES THE SLOPES WITH CRIMSON TOWARDS THE DECLINE OF SUMMER
6673-72311-0003 AND MANTLES THEM IN SOFT WARM BROWN IN WINTER LIKE THE FUR OF AN ANIMAL IN ZENNOR IS A LITTLE CHURCH BUILT OF GRANITE RUDE AND SIMPLE OF CONSTRUCTION CROUCHING LOW TO AVOID THE GALES
6673-72311-0004 BUT WITH A TOWER THAT HAS DEFIED THE WINDS AND THE LASHING RAINS BECAUSE WHOLLY DEVOID OF SCULPTURED DETAIL WHICH WOULD HAVE AFFORDED THE BLASTS SOMETHING TO LAY HOLD OF AND EAT AWAY IN ZENNOR PARISH IS ONE OF THE FINEST CROMLECHS IN CORNWALL
6673-72311-0005 A HUGE SLAB OF UNWROUGHT STONE LIKE A TABLE POISED ON THE POINTS OF STANDING UPRIGHT BLOCKS AS RUDE AS THE MASS THEY SUSTAIN
6673-72311-0006 NEAR THIS MONUMENT OF A HOAR AND INDEED UNKNOWN ANTIQUITY LIVED AN OLD WOMAN BY HERSELF IN A SMALL COTTAGE OF ONE STORY IN HEIGHT
6673-72311-0007 AND POINTED ONLY WITH LIME IT WAS THATCHED WITH HEATHER AND POSSESSED BUT A SINGLE CHIMNEY THAT ROSE BUT LITTLE ABOVE THE APEX OF THE ROOF
6673-72311-0008 AND HAD TWO SLATES SET ON THE TOP TO PROTECT THE RISING SMOKE FROM BEING BLOWN DOWN THE CHIMNEY INTO THE COTTAGE WHEN THE WIND WAS FROM THE WEST OR FROM THE EAST WHEN HOWEVER IT DROVE FROM NORTH OR SOUTH
6673-72311-0009 THEN THE SMOKE MUST TAKE CARE OF ITSELF ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS WONT TO FIND ITS WAY OUT OF THE DOOR AND LITTLE OR NONE WENT UP THE CHIMNEY THE ONLY FUEL BURNT IN THIS COTTAGE WAS PEAT
6673-72311-0010 TAKEN FROM THE SURFACE AND COMPOSED OF UNDISSOLVED ROOTS SUCH FUEL GIVES FLAME WHICH THE OTHER DOES NOT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT DOES NOT THROW OUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF HEAT NOR DOES IT LAST ONE HALF THE TIME
6673-72311-0011 THE WOMAN WHO LIVED IN THE COTTAGE WAS CALLED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AUNT JOANNA WHAT HER FAMILY NAME WAS BUT FEW REMEMBERED NOR DID IT CONCERN HERSELF MUCH SHE HAD NO RELATIONS AT ALL
6673-72311-0012 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A GRAND NIECE WHO WAS MARRIED TO A SMALL TRADESMAN A WHEELWRIGHT NEAR THE CHURCH BUT JOANNA AND HER GREAT NIECE WERE NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS THE GIRL HAD MORTALLY OFFENDED THE OLD WOMAN BY GOING TO A DANCE AT SAINT IVES
6673-72311-0013 AGAINST HER EXPRESS ORDERS IT WAS AT THIS DANCE THAT SHE HAD MET THE WHEELWRIGHT AND THIS MEETING AND THE TREATMENT THE GIRL HAD MET WITH FROM HER AUNT FOR HAVING GONE TO IT HAD LED TO THE MARRIAGE
6673-72311-0014 FOR AUNT JOANNA WAS VERY STRICT IN HER WESLEYANISM AND BITTERLY HOSTILE TO ALL SUCH CARNAL AMUSEMENTS AS DANCING AND PLAY ACTING OF THE LATTER THERE WAS NONE IN THAT WILD WEST CORNISH DISTRICT
6673-72311-0015 AND NO TEMPTATION EVER AFFORDED BY A STROLLING COMPANY SETTING UP ITS BOOTH WITHIN REACH OF ZENNOR BUT DANCING THOUGH DENOUNCED STILL DREW THE MORE INDEPENDENT SPIRITS TOGETHER
6673-72311-0016 ROSE PENALUNA HAD BEEN WITH HER GREAT AUNT AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH SHE WAS A LIVELY GIRL AND WHEN SHE HEARD OF A DANCE AT SAINT IVES AND HAD BEEN ASKED TO GO TO IT ALTHOUGH FORBIDDEN BY AUNT JOANNA
6673-72311-0017 SHE STOLE FROM THE COTTAGE AT NIGHT AND FOUND HER WAY TO SAINT IVES HER CONDUCT WAS REPREHENSIBLE CERTAINLY BUT THAT OF AUNT JOANNA WAS EVEN MORE SO
6673-72311-0018 FOR WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT THE GIRL HAD LEFT THE HOUSE SHE BARRED HER DOOR AND REFUSED TO ALLOW ROSE TO RE ENTER IT THE POOR GIRL HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE REFUGE THE SAME NIGHT AT THE NEAREST FARM AND SLEEP IN AN OUTHOUSE
6673-72311-0019 INTO SERVICE SHE DID NOT GO FOR WHEN ABRAHAM HEXT THE CARPENTER HEARD HOW SHE HAD BEEN TREATED HE AT ONCE PROPOSED AND IN THREE WEEKS MARRIED HER
6673-72311-0020 SINCE THEN NO COMMUNICATION HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE OLD WOMAN AND HER GRAND NIECE AS ROSE KNEW JOANNA WAS IMPLACABLE IN HER RESENTMENTS AND CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD BEEN ACTING ARIGHT IN WHAT SHE HAD DONE
6673-72311-0021 THE NEAREST FARM TO AUNT JOANNA'S COTTAGE WAS OCCUPIED BY THE HOCKINS ONE DAY ELIZABETH THE FARMER'S WIFE SAW THE OLD WOMAN OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE AS SHE WAS HERSELF RETURNING FROM MARKET

6673-72311-0048 AND IT'S BUTTER I'VE LET HER HAVE NOW AND THEN IN A LIBERAL WAY
6673-72311-0049 ALL ZENNOR DECLARED THAT THE HOCKINS WERE A MOST NEIGHBOURLY AND GENEROUS COUPLE WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT THEY TOOK UPON THEMSELVES TO DEFRAY THE FUNERAL EXPENSES MISSUS HEXT CAME TO THE FARM AND SAID THAT SHE WAS WILLING TO DO WHAT SHE COULD BUT MISSUS HOCKIN REPLIED
6673-72311-0050 MY GOOD ROSE IT'S NO GOOD I SEED YOUR AUNT WHEN HER WAS AILIN AND NIGH ON DEATH AND HER LAID IT ON ME SOLEMN AS COULD BE THAT WE WAS TO BURY HER AND THAT SHE'D HAVE NOTHIN TO DO WI THE HEXTS AT NO PRICE ROSE SIGHED AND WENT AWAY
6673-72311-0051 ROSE HAD NOT EXPECTED TO RECEIVE ANYTHING FROM HER AUNT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THE TREASURES IN THE OAK CHEST AS FAR AS SHE HAD BEEN AWARE AUNT JOANNA HAD BEEN EXTREMELY POOR BUT SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE OLD WOMAN HAD AT ONE TIME BEFRIENDED HER
6673-72311-0052 AND SHE WAS READY TO FORGIVE THE HARSH TREATMENT TO WHICH SHE HAD FINALLY BEEN SUBJECTED IN FACT SHE HAD REPEATEDLY MADE OVERTURES TO HER GREAT AUNT TO BE RECONCILED BUT THESE OVERTURES HAD BEEN ALWAYS REJECTED
6673-72311-0053 SHE WAS ACCORDINGLY NOT SURPRISED TO LEARN FROM MISSUS HOCKIN THAT THE OLD WOMAN'S LAST WORDS HAD BEEN AS REPORTED BUT ALTHOUGH DISOWNED AND DISINHERITED ROSE HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN DRESSED IN BLACK AND WERE CHIEF MOURNERS AT THE FUNERAL
6673-72311-0054 NOW IT HAD SO HAPPENED THAT WHEN IT CAME TO THE LAYING OUT OF AUNT JOANNA MISSUS HOCKIN HAD LOOKED AT THE BEAUTIFUL LINEN SHEETS SHE HAD FOUND IN THE OAK CHEST WITH THE OBJECT OF FURNISHING THE CORPSE WITH ONE AS A WINDING SHEET
6673-72311-0055 IT WOULD REALLY BE A SHAME TO SPOIL A PAIR AND WHERE ELSE COULD SHE GET SUCH FINE AND BEAUTIFUL OLD LINEN AS WAS THIS SO SHE PUT THE SHEETS AWAY AND FURNISHED FOR THE PURPOSE A CLEAN BUT COARSE AND RAGGED SHEET SUCH AS AUNT JOANNA HAD IN COMMON USE
6673-72311-0056 THAT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO MOULDER IN THE GRAVE IT WOULD BE POSITIVELY SINFUL BECAUSE WASTEFUL TO GIVE UP TO CORRUPTION AND THE WORM SUCH FINE WHITE LINEN AS AUNT JOANNA HAD HOARDED THE FUNERAL WAS CONDUCTED OTHERWISE LIBERALLY
6673-72311-0057 AUNT JOANNA WAS GIVEN AN ELM AND NOT A MEAN DEAL BOARD COFFIN SUCH AS IS PROVIDED FOR PAUPERS AND A HANDSOME ESCUTCHEON OF WHITE METAL WAS PUT ON THE LID MOREOVER PLENTY OF GIN WAS DRUNK AND CAKE AND CHEESE EATEN AT THE HOUSE
6673-72311-0058 ALL AT THE EXPENSE OF THE HOCKINS AND THE CONVERSATION AMONG THOSE WHO ATTENDED AND ATE AND DRANK AND WIPED THEIR EYES WAS RATHER ANENT THE GENEROSITY OF THE HOCKINS THAN OF THE VIRTUES OF THE DEPARTED
6673-72311-0059 MISTER AND MISSUS HOCKIN HEARD THIS AND THEIR HEARTS SWELLED WITHIN THEM NOTHING SO SWELLS THE HEART AS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF VIRTUE BEING RECOGNISED
6673-72311-0060 HE'D HAVE A NEAT STONE ERECTED ABOVE THE GRAVE WITH WORK ON IT AT TWOPENCE A LETTER THE NAME AND THE DATE OF DEPARTURE OF AUNT JOANNA
6673-72311-0061 AND HER AGE AND TWO LINES OF A FAVOURITE HYMN OF HIS ALL ABOUT EARTH BEING NO DWELLING PLACE HEAVEN BEING PROPERLY HER HOME IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT ELIZABETH HOCKIN CRIED BUT SHE DID THIS DAY
6673-72311-0062 SHE WEPT TEARS OF SYMPATHY WITH THE DECEASED AND HAPPINESS AT THE OVATION ACCORDED TO HERSELF AND HER HUSBAND AT LENGTH AS THE SHORT WINTER DAY CLOSED IN
6673-72311-0063 THE LAST OF THOSE WHO HAD ATTENDED THE FUNERAL AND HAD RETURNED TO THE FARM TO RECRUIT AND REGALE AFTER IT DEPARTED AND THE HOCKINS WERE LEFT TO THEMSELVES
6673-72311-0064 SAID JABEZ AY RESPONDED ELIZABETH AND WHAT A SIGHT O PEOPLE CAME HERE THIS HERE BURYIN OF AUNT JOANNA HAVE SET US UP TREMENDOUS IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE NEIGHBOURS I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO ELSE WOULD HA DONE IT FOR A POOR OLD CREETUR AS IS NO RELATION AY
6673-72311-0065 AND IT'S A FINE PROVERB I FEELS IT IN MY INSIDES
6673-72311-0066 NO IT'S VIRTUE IT'S WARMER NOR GIN A LONG SIGHT GIN GIVES A SMOULDERING SPARK BUT A GOOD CONSCIENCE IS A BLAZE OF FURZE THE FARM OF THE HOCKINS WAS SMALL AND HOCKIN LOOKED AFTER HIS CATTLE HIMSELF
6673-72311-0067 ONE MAID WAS KEPT BUT NO MAN IN THE HOUSE ALL WERE WONT TO RETIRE EARLY TO BED NEITHER HOCKIN NOR HIS WIFE HAD LITERARY TASTES AND WERE NOT DISPOSED TO CONSUME MUCH OIL SO AS TO READ AT NIGHT
6673-72311-0068 DURING THE NIGHT AT WHAT TIME SHE DID NOT KNOW MISSUS HOCKIN AWOKE WITH A START AND FOUND THAT HER HUSBAND WAS SITTING UP IN BED LISTENING THERE WAS A MOON THAT NIGHT AND NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY
6673-72311-0069 WE'LL DO SO BUT I HOPE IT'S NOT WHAT MISSUS HOCKIN DID NOT ANSWER SHE AND HER HUSBAND CREPT FROM BED AND TREADING ON TIPTOE ACROSS THE ROOM DESCENDED THE STAIR
6673-72311-0070 THERE WAS NO DOOR AT THE BOTTOM BUT THE STAIRCASE WAS BOARDED UP AT THE SIDE IT OPENED INTO THE KITCHEN THEY DESCENDED VERY SOFTLY AND CAUTIOUSLY HOLDING EACH OTHER AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM
6673-72311-0071 PEERED TIMOROUSLY INTO THE APARTMENT THAT SERVED MANY PURPOSES KITCHEN SITTING ROOM AND DINING PLACE THE MOONLIGHT POURED IN THROUGH THE BROAD LOW WINDOW BY IT THEY SAW A FIGURE
6673-72311-0072 THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKING IT IT WAS THAT OF AUNT JOANNA CLOTHED IN THE TATTERED SHEET THAT ELIZABETH HOCKIN HAD ALLOWED FOR HER GRAVE CLOTHES
6673-72311-0073 THE OLD WOMAN HAD TAKEN ONE OF THE FINE LINEN SHEETS OUT OF THE CUPBOARD IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN PLACED AND HAD SPREAD IT OVER THE LONG TABLE AND WAS SMOOTHING IT DOWN WITH HER BONY HANDS THE HOCKINS TREMBLED NOT WITH COLD
6673-72311-0074 THOUGH IT WAS MID WINTER BUT WITH TERROR THEY DARED NOT ADVANCE AND THEY FELT POWERLESS TO RETREAT THEN THEY SAW AUNT JOANNA GO TO THE CUPBOARD OPEN IT AND RETURN WITH THE SILVER SPOONS
6673-72311-0075 SHE PLACED ALL SIX ON THE SHEET AND WITH A LEAN FINGER COUNTED THEM SHE TURNED HER FACE TOWARDS THOSE WHO WERE WATCHING HER PROCEEDINGS BUT IT WAS IN SHADOW
6673-72311-0076 AND THEY COULD NOT DISTINGUISH THE FEATURES NOR NOTE THE EXPRESSION WITH WHICH SHE REGARDED THEM PRESENTLY SHE WENT BACK TO THE CUPBOARD AND RETURNED WITH THE SILVER TEAPOT SHE STOOD AT ONE END OF THE TABLE
6673-72311-0077 AND NOW THE REFLECTION OF THE MOON ON THE LINEN SHEET WAS CAST UPON HER FACE AND THEY SAW THAT SHE WAS MOVING HER LIPS BUT NO SOUND ISSUED FROM THEM SHE THRUST HER HAND INTO THE TEAPOT AND DREW FORTH THE COINS ONE BY ONE
6673-72311-0078 AND ROLLED THEM ALONG THE TABLE THE HOCKINS SAW THE GLINT OF THE METAL AND THE SHADOW CAST BY EACH PIECE OF MONEY AS IT ROLLED THE FIRST COIN LODGED AT THE FURTHER LEFT HAND CORNER AND THE SECOND RESTED NEAR IT
6673-72311-0079 AND SO ON THE PIECES WERE ROLLED AND RANGED THEMSELVES IN ORDER TEN IN A ROW THEN THE NEXT TEN WERE RUN ACROSS THE WHITE CLOTH IN THE SAME MANNER AND DROPPED OVER ON THEIR SIDES BELOW THE FIRST ROW
6673-72311-0080 THERE WAS NO SLEEP FOR THEM THAT NIGHT IN THE GLOOM WHEN THE MOON WAS CONCEALED IN THE GLARE WHEN IT SHONE FORTH IT WAS THE SAME
6673-72311-0081 WAS THE SUPPLY INEXHAUSTIBLE IT WAS NOT SO BUT APPARENTLY THE DEAD WOMAN DID NOT WEARY OF COUNTING THE COINS WHEN ALL HAD BEEN RANGED
6673-72311-0082 NOT TILL NEAR DAYBREAK DID THIS SOUND CEASE AND NOT TILL THE MAID SALLY HAD BEGUN TO STIR IN THE INNER BEDCHAMBER DID HOCKIN AND HIS WIFE VENTURE TO RISE
6673-72311-0083 NEITHER WOULD SUFFER THE SERVANT GIRL TO DESCEND TILL THEY HAD BEEN DOWN TO SEE IN WHAT CONDITION THE KITCHEN WAS THEY FOUND THAT THE TABLE HAD BEEN CLEARED THE COINS WERE ALL BACK IN THE TEAPOT
6673-72311-0084 AND THAT AND THE SPOONS WERE WHERE THEY HAD THEMSELVES PLACED THEM THE SHEET MOREOVER WAS NEATLY FOLDED AND REPLACED WHERE IT HAD BEEN BEFORE THE HOCKINS DID NOT SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER OF THEIR EXPERIENCES DURING THE PAST NIGHT SO LONG AS THEY WERE IN THE HOUSE
6673-72311-0085 CURIOUS US SHOULD HA DREAMED ALIKE I DON'T KNOW THAT TWERE THE GIN MADE US DREAM AND US BOTH HAD GIN SO US DREAMED THE SAME THING TWERE MORE LIKE REAL TRUTH THAN DREAM OBSERVED ELIZABETH
6673-72311-0086 BUT PRECISELY THE SAME SOUNDS WERE HEARD ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
6673-72311-0087 I RECKON SAID HOCKIN WE'LL BIDE IN THE PORCH AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY BE LEFT THERE TILL MORNIN WHY WE MAY CARRY EM BACK WI AN EASY CONSCIENCE WE'VE SPENT SOME POUNDS OVER HER BURYIN WHAT HAVE IT COME TO
6673-72311-0088 THREE POUNDS FIVE AND FOURPENCE AS I MAKE IT OUT
6673-72311-0089 SAID ELIZABETH WE MUST RISK IT WHEN NIGHT HAD FALLEN MURK THE FARMER AND HIS WIFE CREPT FROM THEIR HOUSE CARRYING THE LINEN SHEETS THE TEAPOT AND THE SILVER SPOONS THEY DID NOT START TILL LATE FOR FEAR OF ENCOUNTERING ANY VILLAGERS ON THE WAY
6673-72311-0090 AND NOT TILL AFTER THE MAID SALLY HAD GONE TO BED THEY FASTENED THE FARM DOOR BEHIND THEM THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND STORMY WITH SCUDDING CLOUDS SO DENSE AS TO MAKE DEEP NIGHT WHEN THEY DID NOT PART AND ALLOW THE MOON TO PEER FORTH
6673-72311-0091 THEY WALKED TIMOROUSLY AND SIDE BY SIDE LOOKING ABOUT THEM AS THEY PROCEEDED AND ON REACHING THE CHURCHYARD GATE THEY HALTED TO PLUCK UP COURAGE BEFORE OPENING AND VENTURING WITHIN
6673-72311-0092 TOGETHER THEY HEAPED THE ARTICLES THAT HAD BELONGED TO AUNT JOANNA UPON THE FRESH GRAVE BUT AS THEY DID SO THE WIND CAUGHT THE LINEN AND UNFURLED AND FLAPPED IT AND THEY WERE FORCED TO PLACE STONES UPON IT TO HOLD IT DOWN
6673-72311-0093 THEN QUAKING WITH FEAR THEY RETREATED TO THE CHURCH PORCH AND JABEZ UNCORKING THE BOTTLE FIRST TOOK A LONG PULL HIMSELF AND THEN PRESENTED IT TO HIS WIFE
6673-72311-0094 AND NOW DOWN CAME A TEARING RAIN DRIVEN BY A BLAST FROM THE ATLANTIC HOWLING AMONG THE GRAVESTONES AND SCREAMING IN THE BATTLEMENTS OF THE TOWER AND ITS BELL CHAMBER WINDOWS
6673-72311-0095 THE NIGHT WAS SO DARK AND THE RAIN FELL SO HEAVILY THAT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING FOR FULL HALF AN HOUR BUT THEN THE CLOUDS WERE RENT ASUNDER AND THE MOON GLARED WHITE AND GHASTLY OVER THE CHURCHYARD ELIZABETH CAUGHT HER HUSBAND BY THE ARM AND POINTED
6673-72311-0096 AND THIS WAS SEEN GROPING ABOUT THE GRASS TILL IT LAID HOLD OF THE TEAPOT THEN IT GROPED AGAIN AND GATHERED UP THE SPOONS THAT FLASHED IN THE MOONBEAMS NEXT UP CAME THE SECOND HAND
6673-72311-0097 AND A LONG ARM THAT STRETCHED ALONG THE GRAVE TILL IT REACHED THE OTHER SHEETS AT ONCE ON BEING RAISED THESE SHEETS WERE CAUGHT BY THE WIND AND FLAPPED AND FLUTTERED LIKE HALF HOISTED SAILS
6673-72311-0098 THE HANDS RETAINED THEM FOR A WHILE TILL THEY BELLIED WITH THE WIND AND THEN LET THEM GO AND THEY WERE SWEPT AWAY BY THE BLAST ACROSS THE CHURCHYARD OVER THE WALL AND LODGED IN THE CARPENTER'S YARD THAT ADJOINED AMONG HIS TIMBER
6673-72311-0099 NEXT THE HANDS BEGAN TO TRIFLE WITH THE TEAPOT AND TO SHAKE OUT SOME OF THE COINS IN A MINUTE SOME SILVER PIECES WERE FLUNG WITH SO TRUE AN AIM THAT THEY FELL CLINKING DOWN ON THE FLOOR OF THE PORCH
6673-72311-0100 HOW MANY COINS HOW MUCH MONEY WAS CAST THE COUPLE WERE IN NO MOOD TO ESTIMATE THEN THEY SAW THE HANDS COLLECT THE PILLOW CASES AND PROCEED TO ROLL UP THE TEAPOT AND SILVER SPOONS IN THEM AND THAT DONE
6673-72311-0101 THE WHITE BUNDLE WAS CAST INTO THE AIR AND CAUGHT BY THE WIND AND CARRIED OVER THE CHURCHYARD WALL INTO THE WHEELWRIGHT'S YARD AT ONCE A CURTAIN OF VAPOUR RUSHED ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON AND AGAIN THE GRAVEYARD WAS BURIED IN DARKNESS
6673-72311-0102 HALF AN HOUR ELAPSED BEFORE THE MOON SHONE OUT AGAIN THEN THE HOCKINS SAW THAT NOTHING WAS STIRRING IN THE CEMETERY I RECKON US MAY GO NOW SAID JABEZ LET US GATHER UP WHAT SHE CHUCKED TO US ADVISED ELIZABETH
6673-72311-0103 SO THE COUPLE FELT ABOUT THE FLOOR AND COLLECTED A NUMBER OF COINS WHAT THEY WERE THEY COULD NOT TELL TILL THEY REACHED THEIR HOME AND HAD LIGHTED A CANDLE HOW MUCH BE IT ASKED ELIZABETH
