242-126842-0000 HE HAD NOT FELT VERY KEENLY OVER THE MATTER OF THE SERMONS AND CERTAINLY THE MERE FACT THAT PETER COULD EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT MAKING FACES DID NOT CAST ANY REFLECTION ON THE HONOUR OR ABILITY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS
242-126842-0001 BUT TO FELIX EVERYTHING SUDDENLY BECAME FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE BECAUSE PETER CONTINUED TO HOLD THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF BITTER APPLES IT HAUNTED HIS WAKING HOURS AND OBSESSED HIS NIGHTS I HEARD HIM TALKING IN HIS SLEEP ABOUT IT
242-126842-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD HAVE MADE HIM THIN THE WAY HE WORRIED OVER THIS MATTER WOULD HAVE DONE IT FOR MYSELF I CARED NOT A GROAT
242-126842-0003 AND FELT SORE WHENEVER I THOUGHT OF MY FAILURE BUT I HAD NO BURNING DESIRE TO EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT GRIMACING AND I DID NOT SYMPATHIZE OVER AND ABOVE WITH MY BROTHER WHEN HOWEVER HE TOOK TO PRAYING ABOUT IT
242-126842-0004 I REALIZED HOW DEEPLY HE FELT ON THE SUBJECT AND HOPED HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL FELIX PRAYED EARNESTLY THAT HE MIGHT BE ENABLED TO EAT A BITTER APPLE WITHOUT MAKING A FACE AND WHEN HE HAD PRAYED THREE NIGHTS AFTER THIS MANNER
242-126842-0005 HE CONTRIVED TO EAT A BITTER APPLE WITHOUT A GRIMACE UNTIL HE CAME TO THE LAST BITE WHICH PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM BUT FELIX WAS VASTLY ENCOURAGED
242-126842-0006 HE TOLD FELICITY AND FELICITY TOLD ME SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT IT WAS REAL CUTE OF HIM I THINK THAT IS A DREADFUL WAY TO TALK ABOUT PRAYING AND I TOLD HER SO
242-126842-0007 IT ISN'T FAIR OH FELIX DON'T TALK LIKE THAT SAID CECILY SHOCKED GOD MUST BE FAIR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE REASON PETER PRAYS THREE TIMES A DAY REGULAR
242-126842-0008 IN THE MORNING AND AT DINNER TIME AND AT NIGHT AND BESIDES THAT ANY TIME THROUGH THE DAY WHEN HE HAPPENS TO THINK OF IT HE JUST PRAYS STANDING UP DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SUCH GOINGS ON WELL
242-126842-0009 HE'S GOT TO STOP PRAYING AGAINST ME ANYHOW SAID FELIX RESOLUTELY
242-126842-0010 FELIX MARCHED OVER TO UNCLE ROGER'S AND WE TRAILED AFTER SCENTING A SCENE WE FOUND PETER SHELLING BEANS IN THE GRANARY AND WHISTLING CHEERILY AS WITH A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENCE TOWARDS ALL MEN LOOK HERE PETER
242-126842-0011 SAID FELIX OMINOUSLY THEY TELL ME THAT YOU'VE BEEN PRAYING RIGHT ALONG THAT I COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE NOW I TELL YOU
242-126842-0012 I NEVER MENTIONED YOUR NAME I NEVER PRAYED THAT YOU COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE I JUST PRAYED THAT I'D BE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD WELL THAT'S THE SAME THING CRIED FELIX YOU'VE JUST BEEN PRAYING FOR THE OPPOSITE TO ME OUT OF SPITE
242-126842-0013 AND YOU'VE GOT TO STOP IT PETER CRAIG
242-126842-0014 EVEN IF YOU WAS BROUGHT UP IN TORONTO I S'POSE YOU THINK A HIRED BOY HASN'T ANY BUSINESS TO PRAY FOR PARTICULAR THINGS BUT I'LL SHOW YOU I'LL JUST PRAY FOR WHAT I PLEASE AND I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY AND STOP ME
242-126842-0015 SAID FELIX THE GIRLS GASPED BUT DAN AND I WERE JUBILANT SNUFFING BATTLE AFAR OFF ALL RIGHT I CAN FIGHT AS WELL AS PRAY OH DON'T FIGHT IMPLORED CECILY I THINK IT WOULD BE DREADFUL
242-126842-0016 BUT IF HE DOES THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SETTLE IT BUT HOW WILL THAT SETTLE IT ASKED CECILY
242-126842-0017 I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE WOULD SAY HE RETORTED FELICITY TRIED ANOTHER TACK YOU'LL BE SURE TO GET WHIPPED IF YOU FIGHT WITH PETER SHE SAID YOU'RE TOO FAT TO FIGHT
242-126842-0018 AFTER THAT NO MORAL FORCE ON EARTH COULD HAVE PREVENTED FELIX FROM FIGHTING HE WOULD HAVE FACED AN ARMY WITH BANNERS YOU MIGHT SETTLE IT BY DRAWING LOTS SAID CECILY DESPERATELY DRAWING LOTS IS WICKEDER THAT FIGHTING SAID DAN
242-126842-0019 GAMBLING WHAT WOULD AUNT JANE SAY IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT CECILY DEMANDED OF PETER DON'T YOU DRAG MY AUNT JANE INTO THIS AFFAIR SAID PETER DARKLY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PRESBYTERIAN
242-126842-0020 PERSISTED CECILY GOOD PRESBYTERIANS DON'T FIGHT OH DON'T THEY I HEARD YOUR UNCLE ROGER SAY THAT PRESBYTERIANS WERE THE BEST FOR FIGHTING IN THE WORLD OR THE WORST I FORGET WHICH HE SAID BUT IT MEANS THE SAME THING
242-126842-0021 I GUESS YOU MEAN PRINCIPLE I SUGGESTED YES THAT'S IT AGREED PETER IT'S ALL RIGHT TO FIGHT FOR PRINCIPLE IT'S KIND OF PRAYING WITH YOUR FISTS OH CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING TO PREVENT THEM FROM FIGHTING SARA
242-126842-0022 PLEADED CECILY TURNING TO THE STORY GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A BIN SWINGING HER SHAPELY BARE FEET TO AND FRO IT DOESN'T DO TO MEDDLE IN AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND BETWEEN BOYS SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY
242-126842-0023 I MAY BE MISTAKEN BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE STORY GIRL WANTED THAT FIGHT STOPPED
242-126842-0024 IT WAS ULTIMATELY ARRANGED THAT THE COMBAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE FIR WOOD BEHIND UNCLE ROGER'S GRANARY IT WAS A NICE REMOTE BOSKY PLACE WHERE NO PROWLING GROWN UP WOULD BE LIKELY TO INTRUDE
242-126842-0025 AND THITHER WE ALL RESORTED AT SUNSET I HOPE FELIX WILL BEAT SAID THE STORY GIRL TO ME NOT ONLY FOR THE FAMILY HONOUR BUT BECAUSE THAT WAS A MEAN MEAN PRAYER OF PETER'S DO YOU THINK HE WILL I DON'T KNOW
242-126842-0026 AND HE'S A YEAR OLDER THAN FELIX
242-126842-0027 DID YOU EVER FIGHT ASKED THE STORY GIRL ONCE I SAID BRIEFLY DREADING THE NEXT QUESTION WHICH PROMPTLY CAME WHO BEAT IT IS SOMETIMES A BITTER THING TO TELL THE TRUTH
242-126842-0028 THE OTHER FELLOW I SAID WITH RELUCTANT HONESTY WELL SAID THE STORY GIRL I THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU GET WHIPPED OR NOT SO LONG AS YOU FIGHT A GOOD SQUARE FIGHT
242-126842-0029 HER POTENT VOICE MADE ME FEEL THAT I WAS QUITE A HERO AFTER ALL AND THE STING WENT OUT OF MY RECOLLECTION OF THAT OLD FIGHT WHEN WE ARRIVED BEHIND THE GRANARY THE OTHERS WERE ALL THERE
242-126842-0030 CECILY WAS VERY PALE AND FELIX AND PETER WERE TAKING OFF THEIR COATS THERE WAS A PURE YELLOW SUNSET THAT EVENING
242-126842-0031 A COOL AUTUMNAL WIND WAS WHISTLING AMONG THE DARK BOUGHS AND SCATTERING BLOOD RED LEAVES FROM THE MAPLE AT THE END OF THE GRANARY NOW SAID DAN I'LL COUNT
242-126842-0032 CECILY KEEP QUIET NOW ONE TWO THREE PETER AND FELIX PITCHED IN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN DISCRETION ON BOTH SIDES AS A RESULT PETER GOT WHAT LATER DEVELOPED INTO A BLACK EYE AND FELIX'S NOSE BEGAN TO BLEED
242-126842-0033 CECILY GAVE A SHRIEK AND RAN OUT OF THE WOOD WE THOUGHT SHE HAD FLED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND WE WERE NOT SORRY FOR HER MANIFEST DISAPPROVAL AND ANXIETY WERE DAMPING THE EXCITEMENT OF THE OCCASION
242-126842-0034 UNCLE ALEC WALKED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE GRANARY WITH CECILY BEHIND HIM HE WAS NOT ANGRY THERE WAS A QUIZZICAL LOOK IN HIS EYES BUT HE TOOK THE COMBATANTS BY THEIR SHIRT COLLARS AND DRAGGED THEM APART THIS STOPS RIGHT HERE BOYS
242-126842-0035 PETER NO I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT SAID UNCLE ALEC STERNLY I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WERE FIGHTING ABOUT BUT YOU MUST SETTLE YOUR QUARRELS IN A DIFFERENT FASHION REMEMBER MY COMMANDS FELIX PETER
