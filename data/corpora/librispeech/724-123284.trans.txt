724-123284-0000 PREPARATIONS FOR A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY THE NEXT MORNING I AWOKE FEELING PERFECTLY WELL I THOUGHT A BATHE WOULD DO ME GOOD AND I WENT TO PLUNGE FOR A FEW MINUTES INTO THE WATERS OF THIS MEDITERRANEAN SEA
724-123284-0001 FOR ASSUREDLY IT BETTER DESERVED THIS NAME THAN ANY OTHER SEA I CAME BACK TO BREAKFAST WITH A GOOD APPETITE HANS WAS A GOOD CATERER FOR OUR LITTLE HOUSEHOLD HE HAD WATER AND FIRE AT HIS DISPOSAL
724-123284-0002 FOR HIGH TIDE AND WE MUST NOT LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THIS PHENOMENON WHAT THE TIDE I CRIED CAN THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUN AND MOON BE FELT DOWN HERE WHY NOT
724-123284-0003 ARE NOT ALL BODIES SUBJECT THROUGHOUT THEIR MASS TO THE POWER OF UNIVERSAL ATTRACTION THIS MASS OF WATER CANNOT ESCAPE THE GENERAL LAW AND IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE ON THE SURFACE YOU WILL SEE IT RISE LIKE THE ATLANTIC ITSELF
724-123284-0004 AND JUDGING BY THESE RIDGES OF FOAM YOU MAY OBSERVE THAT THE SEA WILL RISE ABOUT TWELVE FEET THIS IS WONDERFUL I SAID NO IT IS QUITE NATURAL YOU MAY SAY SO UNCLE BUT TO ME IT IS MOST EXTRAORDINARY
724-123284-0005 WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE IS THERE ANY SCIENTIFIC REASON AGAINST IT NO I
724-123284-0006 SO THEN THUS FAR HE ANSWERED THE THEORY OF SIR HUMPHRY DAVY IS CONFIRMED EVIDENTLY IT IS AND NOW THERE IS NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE SEAS AND CONTINENTS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH NO DOUBT
724-123284-0007 SAID MY UNCLE AND INHABITED TOO TO BE SURE SAID I AND WHY SHOULD NOT THESE WATERS YIELD TO US
724-123284-0008 AT ANY RATE HE REPLIED WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY YET
724-123284-0009 WE WILL TRY AXEL FOR WE MUST PENETRATE ALL SECRETS OF THESE NEWLY DISCOVERED REGIONS BUT WHERE ARE WE UNCLE FOR I HAVE NOT YET ASKED YOU THAT QUESTION AND YOUR INSTRUMENTS MUST BE ABLE TO FURNISH THE ANSWER
724-123284-0010 HORIZONTALLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LEAGUES FROM ICELAND SO MUCH AS THAT I AM SURE OF NOT BEING A MILE OUT OF MY RECKONING
724-123284-0011 WOULD YOU THEN CONCLUDE I SAID THAT THE MAGNETIC POLE IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE AND THE POINT WHERE WE ARE EXACTLY SO AND IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT IF WE WERE TO REACH THE SPOT BENEATH THE POLAR REGIONS
724-123284-0012 ABOUT THAT SEVENTY FIRST DEGREE WHERE SIR JAMES ROSS HAS DISCOVERED THE MAGNETIC POLE TO BE SITUATED WE SHOULD SEE THE NEEDLE POINT STRAIGHT UP THEREFORE THAT MYSTERIOUS CENTRE OF ATTRACTION IS AT NO GREAT DEPTH
724-123284-0013 WHAT DEPTH HAVE WE NOW REACHED WE ARE THIRTY FIVE LEAGUES BELOW THE SURFACE SO I SAID EXAMINING THE MAP THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND ARE OVER OUR HEADS
724-123284-0014 AND THE GRAMPIANS ARE RAISING THEIR RUGGED SUMMITS ABOVE US YES ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR LAUGHING IT IS RATHER A HEAVY WEIGHT TO BEAR BUT A SOLID ARCH SPANS OVER OUR HEADS THE GREAT ARCHITECT HAS BUILT IT OF THE BEST MATERIALS
724-123284-0015 AND NEVER COULD MAN HAVE GIVEN IT SO WIDE A STRETCH WHAT ARE THE FINEST ARCHES OF BRIDGES AND THE ARCADES OF CATHEDRALS COMPARED WITH THIS FAR REACHING VAULT WITH A RADIUS OF THREE LEAGUES
724-123284-0016 OH I AM NOT AFRAID THAT IT WILL FALL DOWN UPON MY HEAD BUT NOW WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS ARE YOU NOT THINKING OF RETURNING TO THE SURFACE NOW RETURN
724-123284-0017 WE WILL CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY EVERYTHING HAVING GONE ON WELL SO FAR BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET DOWN BELOW THIS LIQUID SURFACE
724-123284-0018 BUT IF ALL OCEANS ARE PROPERLY SPEAKING BUT LAKES
724-123284-0019 SO THAT WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE AND WE SHALL SET SAIL TO MORROW I LOOKED ABOUT FOR A SHIP SET SAIL SHALL WE BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY BOAT FIRST IT WILL NOT BE A BOAT AT ALL
724-123284-0020 DON'T YOU HEAR THE HAMMER AT WORK HANS IS ALREADY BUSY AT IT WHAT HAS HE ALREADY FELLED THE TREES OH THE TREES WERE ALREADY DOWN COME AND YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF
724-123284-0021 AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S WALKING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PROMONTORY WHICH FORMED THE LITTLE NATURAL HARBOUR I PERCEIVED HANS AT WORK IN A FEW MORE STEPS I WAS AT HIS SIDE TO MY GREAT SURPRISE
724-123284-0022 A HALF FINISHED RAFT WAS ALREADY LYING ON THE SAND MADE OF A PECULIAR KIND OF WOOD AND A GREAT NUMBER OF PLANKS STRAIGHT AND BENT AND OF FRAMES WERE COVERING THE GROUND ENOUGH ALMOST FOR A LITTLE FLEET
724-123284-0023 A VARIETY OF BROWN COAL OR LIGNITE FOUND CHIEFLY IN ICELAND BUT SURELY THEN LIKE OTHER FOSSIL WOOD IT MUST BE AS HARD AS STONE AND CANNOT FLOAT
724-123284-0024 RETURNED TO THE SURFACE AND OSCILLATED TO AND FRO WITH THE WAVES ARE YOU CONVINCED SAID MY UNCLE I AM QUITE CONVINCED ALTHOUGH IT IS INCREDIBLE BY NEXT EVENING
