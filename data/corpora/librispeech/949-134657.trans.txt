949-134657-0000 OR EVEN TO SEAT THEMSELVES ON HIS VACANT THRONE THE PHILOSOPHER COULD EXCUSE THE HASTY SALLIES OF DISCONTENT AND THE HERO COULD DESPISE THE AMBITIOUS PROJECTS WHICH SURPASSED THE FORTUNE OR THE ABILITIES OF THE RASH CONSPIRATORS A CITIZEN OF ANCYRA
949-134657-0001 HAD PREPARED FOR HIS OWN USE A PURPLE GARMENT
949-134657-0002 THE MONARCH AFTER MAKING SOME INQUIRY INTO THE RANK AND CHARACTER OF HIS RIVAL DESPATCHED THE INFORMER WITH A PRESENT OF A PAIR OF PURPLE SLIPPERS TO COMPLETE THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS IMPERIAL HABIT
949-134657-0003 WHO HAD RESOLVED TO ASSASSINATE JULIAN IN THE FIELD OF EXERCISE NEAR ANTIOCH THEIR INTEMPERANCE REVEALED THEIR GUILT AND THEY WERE CONDUCTED IN CHAINS TO THE PRESENCE OF THEIR INJURED SOVEREIGN WHO AFTER A LIVELY REPRESENTATION OF THE WICKEDNESS AND FOLLY OF THEIR ENTERPRISE
949-134657-0004 INSTEAD OF A DEATH OF TORTURE WHICH THEY DESERVED AND EXPECTED PRONOUNCED A SENTENCE OF EXILE AGAINST THE TWO PRINCIPAL OFFENDERS
949-134657-0005 WAS THE EXECUTION OF A RASH YOUTH WHO WITH A FEEBLE HAND HAD ASPIRED TO SEIZE THE REINS OF EMPIRE BUT THAT YOUTH WAS THE SON OF MARCELLUS THE GENERAL OF CAVALRY
949-134657-0006 WHICH DIOCLETIAN CONSTANTINE AND THE PATIENT HABITS OF FOURSCORE YEARS HAD ESTABLISHED IN THE EMPIRE A MOTIVE OF SUPERSTITION PREVENTED THE EXECUTION OF THE DESIGN WHICH JULIAN HAD FREQUENTLY MEDITATED
949-134657-0007 THAT THEY NO LONGER REMEMBERED ITS SERVILE AND HUMILIATING ORIGIN THE OFFICE OR RATHER THE NAME OF CONSUL WAS CHERISHED BY A PRINCE WHO CONTEMPLATED WITH REVERENCE THE RUINS OF THE REPUBLIC
949-134657-0008 DURING THE GAMES OF THE CIRCUS HE HAD IMPRUDENTLY OR DESIGNEDLY PERFORMED THE MANUMISSION OF A SLAVE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CONSUL THE MOMENT HE WAS REMINDED THAT HE HAD TRESPASSED ON THE JURISDICTION OF ANOTHER MAGISTRATE
949-134657-0009 HE CONDEMNED HIMSELF TO PAY A FINE OF TEN POUNDS OF GOLD AND EMBRACED THIS PUBLIC OCCASION OF DECLARING TO THE WORLD THAT HE WAS SUBJECT
949-134657-0010 THE SPIRIT OF HIS ADMINISTRATION AND HIS REGARD
949-134657-0011 THAT ONE HALF OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL
949-134657-0012 WHICH WAS PERMITTED TO REPRESENT THE MAJESTY OF THE ROMAN NAME
949-134657-0013 SO MANY IDLE CITIZENS FROM THE SERVICES OF THEIR COUNTRY AND BY IMPOSING AN EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC DUTIES HE RESTORED THE STRENGTH THE SPLENDOR OR ACCORDING TO THE GLOWING
949-134657-0014 THE VENERABLE AGE OF GREECE EXCITED THE MOST TENDER COMPASSION IN THE MIND OF JULIAN WHICH KINDLED INTO RAPTURE WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE GODS THE HEROES AND THE MEN SUPERIOR TO HEROES AND TO GODS WHO HAVE BEQUEATHED TO THE LATEST POSTERITY THE MONUMENTS OF THEIR GENIUS
949-134657-0015 ARGOS FOR HER DELIVERER THE PRIDE OF CORINTH AGAIN RISING FROM HER RUINS WITH THE HONORS OF A ROMAN COLONY EXACTED A TRIBUTE FROM THE ADJACENT REPUBLICS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFRAYING THE GAMES OF THE ISTHMUS
949-134657-0016 FROM THIS TRIBUTE THE CITIES OF ELIS OF DELPHI AND OF ARGOS WHICH HAD INHERITED FROM THEIR REMOTE ANCESTORS THE SACRED OFFICE OF PERPETUATING THE OLYMPIC THE PYTHIAN AND THE NEMEAN GAMES CLAIMED A JUST EXEMPTION
949-134657-0017 WHO SEEMS TO HAVE CONSULTED ONLY THE INTEREST OF THE CAPITAL IN WHICH HE RESIDED SEVEN YEARS AFTER THIS SENTENCE
949-134657-0018 AND HIS ELOQUENCE WAS INTERPOSED
949-134657-0019 AND IF THEY CONDESCENDED TO HARANGUE THE SOLDIERS WHOM THEY FEARED THEY TREATED WITH SILENT DISDAIN THE SENATORS WHOM THEY DESPISED THE ASSEMBLIES OF THE SENATE WHICH CONSTANTIUS HAD AVOIDED WERE CONSIDERED BY JULIAN AS THE PLACE WHERE HE COULD EXHIBIT
949-134657-0020 HE ALTERNATELY PRACTISED AS IN A SCHOOL OF DECLAMATION THE SEVERAL MODES OF PRAISE OF CENSURE OF EXHORTATION AND HIS FRIEND LIBANIUS
949-134657-0021 BUT AS AN AMUSEMENT AND ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE TRUSTED THE INTEGRITY AND DISCERNMENT OF HIS PRAETORIAN PRAEFECTS HE OFTEN PLACED HIMSELF BY THEIR SIDE ON THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT THE ACUTE PENETRATION OF HIS MIND WAS AGREEABLY OCCUPIED IN DETECTING AND DEFEATING THE CHICANERY OF THE ADVOCATES
949-134657-0022 WHO LABORED TO DISGUISE THE TRUTHS OF FACTS AND TO PERVERT THE SENSE OF THE LAWS HE SOMETIMES FORGOT THE GRAVITY OF HIS STATION ASKED INDISCREET OR UNSEASONABLE QUESTIONS AND BETRAYED BY THE LOUDNESS OF HIS VOICE AND THE AGITATION OF HIS BODY THE EARNEST VEHEMENCE
949-134657-0023 BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO ENCOURAGE AND EVEN TO SOLICIT THE REPROOF OF HIS FRIENDS AND MINISTERS AND WHENEVER THEY VENTURED TO OPPOSE THE IRREGULAR SALLIES OF HIS PASSIONS THE SPECTATORS COULD OBSERVE THE SHAME AS WELL AS THE GRATITUDE OF THEIR MONARCH
949-134657-0024 AND JULIAN MIGHT HAVE RAISED HIMSELF TO THE RANK OF MINISTER OR GENERAL OF THE STATE IN WHICH HE WAS BORN A PRIVATE CITIZEN IF THE JEALOUS CAPRICE OF POWER HAD DISAPPOINTED HIS EXPECTATIONS IF HE HAD PRUDENTLY DECLINED THE PATHS OF GREATNESS
949-134657-0025 THE PORTRAIT OF JULIAN SOMETHING SEEMS WANTING TO THE GRACE AND PERFECTION OF THE WHOLE FIGURE HIS GENIUS WAS LESS POWERFUL AND SUBLIME THAN THAT OF CAESAR
949-134657-0026 THE ROMANS BEHELD AN EMPEROR WHO MADE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIS DUTIES AND HIS PLEASURES
949-134657-0027 AND WHO ENDEAVORED ALWAYS TO CONNECT AUTHORITY WITH MERIT AND HAPPINESS WITH VIRTUE EVEN FACTION AND RELIGIOUS FACTION WAS CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPERIORITY OF HIS GENIUS IN PEACE AS WELL AS IN WAR AND TO CONFESS WITH A SIGH
949-134657-0028 THAT THE APOSTATE JULIAN WAS A LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY
