948-132707-0000 WE HAVE NOT WRITTEN FOR MANY DAYS WE DID NOT WISH TO SPEAK FOR WE NEEDED NO WORDS TO REMEMBER THAT WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO US
948-132707-0001 WE HID IN THE BUSHES AND WE WAITED THE STEPS CAME CLOSER AND THEN WE SAW THE FOLD OF A WHITE TUNIC AMONG THE TREES AND A GLEAM OF GOLD WE LEAPT FORWARD WE RAN TO THEM
948-132707-0002 AND WE STOOD LOOKING UPON THE GOLDEN ONE THEY SAW US AND THEIR HANDS CLOSED INTO FISTS AND THE FISTS PULLED THEIR ARMS DOWN AS IF THEY WISHED THEIR ARMS TO HOLD THEM
948-132707-0003 WHILE THEIR BODY SWAYED AND THEY COULD NOT SPEAK WE DARED NOT COME TOO CLOSE TO THEM WE ASKED AND OUR VOICE TREMBLED
948-132707-0004 WE ASKED THEY RAISED THEIR HEAD AND THERE WAS A GREAT PRIDE IN THEIR VOICE THEY ANSWERED WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOU THEN WE COULD NOT SPEAK
948-132707-0005 AND THEY SAID WE HEARD THAT YOU HAD GONE TO THE UNCHARTED FOREST FOR THE WHOLE CITY IS SPEAKING OF IT SO ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY WHEN WE HEARD IT WE RAN AWAY FROM THE HOME OF THE PEASANTS
948-132707-0006 WE FOUND THE MARKS OF YOUR FEET ACROSS THE PLAIN WHERE NO MEN WALK SO WE FOLLOWED THEM AND WE WENT INTO THE FOREST AND WE FOLLOWED THE PATH WHERE THE BRANCHES WERE BROKEN BY YOUR BODY
948-132707-0007 THEIR WHITE TUNIC WAS TORN AND THE BRANCHES HAD CUT THE SKIN OF THEIR ARMS BUT THEY SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD NEVER TAKEN NOTICE OF IT NOR OF WEARINESS NOR OF FEAR
948-132707-0008 WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOU THEY SAID AND WE SHALL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO IF DANGER THREATENS YOU WE SHALL FACE IT ALSO IF IT BE DEATH WE SHALL DIE WITH YOU
948-132707-0009 YOUR EYES ARE AS A FLAME BUT OUR BROTHERS HAVE NEITHER HOPE NOR FIRE YOUR MOUTH IS CUT OF GRANITE BUT OUR BROTHERS ARE SOFT AND HUMBLE YOUR HEAD IS HIGH BUT OUR BROTHERS CRINGE
948-132707-0010 YOU WALK BUT OUR BROTHERS CRAWL WE WISH TO BE DAMNED WITH YOU RATHER THAN
948-132707-0011 DO AS YOU PLEASE WITH US BUT DO NOT SEND US AWAY FROM YOU THEN THEY KNELT AND BOWED THEIR GOLDEN HEAD BEFORE US
948-132707-0012 WE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT WHICH WE DID WE BENT TO RAISE THE GOLDEN ONE TO THEIR FEET BUT WHEN WE TOUCHED THEM IT WAS AS IF MADNESS HAD STRICKEN US
948-132707-0013 WE SEIZED THEIR BODY AND WE PRESSED OUR LIPS TO THEIRS THE GOLDEN ONE BREATHED ONCE AND THEIR BREATH WAS A MOAN AND THEN THEIR ARMS CLOSED AROUND US WE STOOD TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME
948-132707-0014 AND WE WERE FRIGHTENED THAT WE HAD LIVED FOR
948-132707-0015 AND HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT JOY IS POSSIBLE TO MEN THEN WE SAID OUR DEAREST ONE FEAR NOTHING OF THE FOREST THERE IS NO DANGER IN SOLITUDE
948-132707-0016 WE HAVE NO NEED OF OUR BROTHERS LET US FORGET THEIR GOOD AND OUR EVIL LET US FORGET ALL THINGS SAVE THAT WE ARE TOGETHER
948-132707-0017 GIVE US YOUR HAND LOOK AHEAD IT IS OUR OWN WORLD GOLDEN ONE A STRANGE UNKNOWN WORLD BUT OUR OWN THEN WE WALKED ON INTO THE FOREST
948-132707-0018 THEIR HAND IN OURS AND THAT NIGHT WE KNEW THAT TO HOLD THE BODY OF WOMEN IN OUR ARMS IS NEITHER UGLY NOR SHAMEFUL BUT THE ONE ECSTASY GRANTED TO THE RACE OF MEN
948-132707-0019 WE HAVE WALKED FOR MANY DAYS THE FOREST HAS NO END AND WE SEEK NO END BUT EACH DAY ADDED TO THE CHAIN OF DAYS BETWEEN US AND THE CITY IS LIKE AN ADDED BLESSING
948-132707-0020 WE HAVE MADE A BOW AND MANY ARROWS WE CAN KILL MORE BIRDS THAN WE NEED FOR OUR FOOD WE FIND WATER AND FRUIT IN THE FOREST AT NIGHT WE CHOOSE A CLEARING AND WE BUILD A RING OF FIRES AROUND IT
948-132707-0021 AS A CROWN OF JEWELS AROUND US AND SMOKE STANDS STILL IN THE AIR IN COLUMNS MADE BLUE BY THE MOONLIGHT WE SLEEP TOGETHER IN THE MIDST OF THE RING THE ARMS OF THE GOLDEN ONE AROUND US
948-132707-0022 THEIR HEAD UPON OUR BREAST SOME DAY WE SHALL STOP AND BUILD A HOUSE WHEN WE SHALL HAVE GONE FAR ENOUGH BUT WE DO NOT HAVE TO HASTEN
948-132707-0023 THE DAYS BEFORE US ARE WITHOUT END LIKE THE FOREST WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS NEW LIFE WHICH WE HAVE FOUND YET IT SEEMS SO CLEAR AND SO SIMPLE WHEN QUESTIONS COME TO PUZZLE US WE WALK FASTER
948-132707-0024 THEN TURN AND FORGET ALL THINGS AS WE WATCH THE GOLDEN ONE FOLLOWING THE SHADOWS OF LEAVES FALL UPON THEIR ARMS AS THEY SPREAD THE BRANCHES APART BUT THEIR SHOULDERS ARE IN THE SUN
948-132707-0025 THE SKIN OF THEIR ARMS IS LIKE A BLUE MIST BUT THEIR SHOULDERS ARE WHITE AND GLOWING AS IF THE LIGHT FELL NOT FROM ABOVE BUT ROSE FROM UNDER THEIR SKIN WE WATCH THE LEAF WHICH HAS FALLEN
948-132707-0026 UPON THEIR SHOULDER AND IT LIES AT THE CURVE OF THEIR NECK AND A DROP OF DEW GLISTENS UPON IT LIKE A JEWEL THEY APPROACH US AND THEY STOP LAUGHING KNOWING WHAT WE THINK
948-132707-0027 AND THEY WAIT OBEDIENTLY WITHOUT QUESTIONS TILL IT PLEASES US TO TURN AND GO ON WE GO ON AND WE BLESS THE EARTH UNDER OUR FEET BUT QUESTIONS COME TO US AGAIN AS WE WALK IN SILENCE
948-132707-0028 THEN WHAT CAN MEN WISH FOR SAVE CORRUPTION IF THIS IS THE GREAT EVIL OF BEING ALONE THEN WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS EVIL EVERYTHING WHICH COMES FROM THE MANY IS GOOD
948-132707-0029 EVERYTHING WHICH COMES FROM ONE IS EVIL
948-132707-0030 WITH OUR FIRST BREATH WE HAVE BROKEN THE LAW BUT WE HAVE NEVER DOUBTED IT YET NOW
948-132707-0031 BUT WE LIVED NOT WHEN WE TOILED FOR OUR BROTHERS WE WERE ONLY WEARY THERE IS NO JOY FOR MEN SAVE THE JOY SHARED WITH ALL THEIR BROTHERS BUT THE ONLY THINGS WHICH TAUGHT US JOY
948-132707-0032 AND THE GOLDEN ONE AND BOTH THESE JOYS BELONG TO US ALONE
948-132707-0033 AND THEY DO NOT CONCERN OUR BROTHERS IN ANY WAY THUS DO WE WONDER THERE IS SOME ERROR ONE FRIGHTFUL ERROR IN THE THINKING OF MEN WHAT IS THAT ERROR WE DO NOT KNOW
948-132707-0034 BUT THE KNOWLEDGE STRUGGLES WITHIN US STRUGGLES TO BE BORN TODAY THE GOLDEN ONE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND SAID WE LOVE YOU
948-132707-0035 NO THEY WHISPERED THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WISHED TO SAY THEY WERE SILENT THEN THEY SPOKE SLOWLY AND THEIR WORDS WERE HALTING LIKE THE WORDS OF A CHILD LEARNING TO SPEAK FOR THE FIRST TIME
948-132707-0036 WE ARE ONE ALONE AND ONLY AND WE LOVE YOU WHO ARE ONE ALONE AND ONLY WE LOOKED INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
