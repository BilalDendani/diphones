6967-50152-0000 THERE WERE TIMES WHEN AS PHILIP HAD ONCE SAID GOOD TEMPER ANNOYED HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING AND PERHAPS HE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED AT HAVING LOST HIS OLD POWER OF FRETTING AND IRRITATING GUY AND WATCHING HIM CHAMP THE BIT SO AS TO JUSTIFY HIS OWN OPINION OF HIM
6967-50152-0001 EVERY PROCEEDING OF HIS COUSINS SEEMED TO GIVE HIM ANNOYANCE MORE ESPECIALLY THEIR BEING AT HOME TOGETHER AND GUY'S SEEMING TO BELONG MORE TO HOLLYWELL THAN HIMSELF HE SAT BY WITH A BOOK AND WATCHED THEM AS GUY ASKED FOR LAURA'S LETTER AND AMY CAME
6967-50152-0002 TO LOOK OVER HIS HALF FINISHED ANSWER LAUGHING OVER IT
6967-50152-0003 AND THE OTHER HOLDING THE LETTER AND GUY WATCHING HER AMUSED FACE AND ANSWERING HER REMARKS
6967-50152-0004 MERE FACTITIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE OF WEALTH IN POSSESSION OF HAPPINESS
6967-50152-0005 HE THOUGHT IT SHALLOW BECAUSE OF THEIR MIRTH AND GAIETY AS IF THEY WERE ONLY SEEKING FOOD FOR LAUGHTER FINDING IT IN MISTAKES FOR WHICH HE WAS READY TO DESPISE THEM ARNAUD HAD BROUGHT
6967-50152-0006 HIS MIND HAD HARDLY OPENED TO RAILROADS AND STEAMERS
6967-50152-0007 GUY AND AMABEL BOTH YOUNG AND HEALTHY CARING LITTLE ABOUT BAD DINNERS AND UNWILLING TO TEASE THE OLD MAN BY COMPLAINTS OR ALTERATIONS OF HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD TROUBLED THEMSELVES LITTLE ABOUT THE MATTER TOOK THINGS AS THEY FOUND THEM ATE DRY BREAD WHEN THE COOKERY WAS BAD
6967-50152-0008 WALKED IF THE ROAD WAS SHOCKING WENT AWAY THE SOONER IF THE INNS WERE INTOLERABLE MADE MERRY OVER EVERY INCONVENIENCE AND TURNED IT INTO AN EXCELLENT STORY FOR CHARLES THEY DID NOT EVEN DISTRESS THEMSELVES ABOUT SIGHTS WHICH THEY HAD MISSED SEEING
6967-50152-0009 PHILIP THOUGHT ALL THIS VERY FOOLISH AND ABSURD SHOWING THAT THEY WERE UNFIT TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THAT GUY WAS NEGLECTFUL OF HIS WIFE'S COMFORTS IN SHORT ESTABLISHING HIS ORIGINAL OPINION OF THEIR YOUTH AND FOLLY SO PASSED THE FIRST EVENING PERHAPS THE WORST BECAUSE BESIDES
6967-50152-0010 WHAT HE HAD HEARD ABOUT LAURA HE HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT OVER FATIGUED BY VARIOUS HOT DAYS WALKS CERTAIN IT IS THAT NEXT MORNING HE WAS NOT NEARLY SO MUCH INCLINED TO BE DISPLEASED WITH THEM FOR LAUGHING WHEN IN SPEAKING TO ANNE HE INADVERTENTLY CALLED HER MISTRESS MISS AMABEL
6967-50152-0011 NEVER MIND SAID AMY AS ANNE DEPARTED AND HE LOOKED DISCONCERTED AS A PRECISE MAN ALWAYS DOES WHEN CATCHING HIMSELF IN A MISTAKE
6967-50152-0012 GUY IS ALWAYS DOING IT AND PUZZLES POOR ARNAUD SORELY BY SENDING HIM FOR MISS AMABEL'S PARASOL AND THE OTHER DAY SAID GUY WHEN THORNDALE'S BROTHER AT MUNICH INQUIRED AFTER LADY MORVILLE I HAD TO CONSIDER WHO SHE WAS OH
6967-50152-0013 YOU SAW THORNDALE'S BROTHER DID YOU YES HE WAS VERY OBLIGING GUY HAD TO GO TO HIM ABOUT OUR PASSPORTS
6967-50152-0014 HE BROUGHT HIS WIFE TO CALL ON US AND ASKED US TO AN EVENING PARTY DID YOU GO GUY THOUGHT WE MUST AND IT WAS VERY ENTERTAINING WE HAD A CURIOUS ADVENTURE THERE IN THE MORNING WE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THOSE BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS OF THE GREAT CHURCH WHEN I TURNED ROUND AND SAW A GENTLEMAN AN ENGLISHMAN
6967-50152-0015 WE MET AGAIN IN THE EVENING AND PRESENTLY MISTER THORNDALE CAME AND TOLD US IT WAS MISTER SHENE SHENE THE PAINTER YES HE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH STRUCK WITH GUY'S FACE IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED FOR A PICTURE HE WAS ABOUT
6967-50152-0016 AND HE WISHED OF ALL THINGS JUST TO BE ALLOWED TO MAKE A SKETCH DID YOU SUBMIT YES SAID GUY
6967-50152-0017 THE NEXT DAY HE TOOK US THROUGH THE GALLERY AND SHOWED US ALL THAT WAS WORTH ADMIRING AND IN WHAT CHARACTER IS HE TO MAKE YOU APPEAR THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT SAID AMABEL DON'T YOU REMEMBER HOW GUY ONCE PUZZLED US BY CHOOSING SIR GALAHAD FOR HIS
6967-50152-0018 IT IS THAT VERY SIR GALAHAD WHEN HE KNEELS TO ADORE THE SAINT GREAL MISTER SHENE SAID HE HAD LONG BEEN DREAMING OVER IT AND AT LAST
6967-50152-0019 AS HE SAW GUY'S FACE LOOKING UPWARDS IT STRUCK HIM THAT IT WAS JUST WHAT HE WANTED IT WOULD BE WORTH ANYTHING TO HIM TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION I WONDER WHAT I WAS LOOKING LIKE EJACULATED GUY DID HE TAKE YOU AS YOURSELF OR AS SIR GALAHAD
6967-50152-0020 AS MYSELF HAPPILY HOW DID HE SUCCEED
6967-50152-0021 COULD SOME FAY THE GIFTIE GIE US TO SEE OURSELVES AS OTHERS SEE US AS FAR AS THE SUN BURNT VISAGE IS CONCERNED THE GLASS DOES THAT EVERY MORNING
6967-50152-0022 YES BUT YOU DON'T LOOK AT YOURSELF EXACTLY AS YOU DO AT A PAINTED WINDOW SAID AMY IN HER DEMURE WAY I CANNOT THINK HOW YOU FOUND TIME FOR SITTING SAID PHILIP
6967-50152-0023 HE PROMISES IT TO ME WHEN HE HAS DONE WITH SIR GALAHAD SAID AMY TWO THREE EVENINGS YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME AT MUNICH A FORTNIGHT SAID GUY THERE IS A GREAT DEAL TO SEE THERE PHILIP DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND THIS NOR DID HE THINK IT VERY SATISFACTORY THAT
6967-50152-0024 TO MAKE THE BEST OF THEM TO DAY AND RETURNED TO HIS USUAL FASHION OF PATRONIZING AND LAYING DOWN THE LAW THEY WERE SO USED TO THIS THAT THEY DID NOT CARE ABOUT IT INDEED
6967-50152-0025 THE DAY WAS CHIEFLY SPENT IN AN EXCURSION ON THE LAKE LANDING AT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOTS WALKING A LITTLE WAY AND ADMIRING OR WHILE IN THE BOAT SMOOTHLY MOVING OVER THE DEEP BLUE WATERS
6967-50152-0026 AND TALKING OVER THE BOOK WITH WHICH THEIR ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEGUN I PROMESSI SPOSI NEVER DID TOURISTS SPEND A MORE SERENE AND PLEASANT DAY ON COMPARING NOTES AS TO THEIR PLANS
6967-50152-0027 IT APPEARED THAT EACH PARTY HAD ABOUT A WEEK OR TEN DAYS TO SPARE THE CAPTAIN BEFORE HE MUST EMBARK FOR CORFU AND SIR GUY AND LADY MORVILLE BEFORE THE TIME THEY HAD FIXED FOR RETURNING HOME
6967-50152-0028 AND GET THE SIGNOR CAPITANO TO BE THEIR INTERPRETER PHILIP THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT THING FOR HIS YOUNG COUSINS FOR HIM TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM AND SHOW THEM HOW PEOPLE OUGHT TO TRAVEL SO OUT CAME HIS LITTLE POCKET MAP
6967-50152-0029 MARKED WITH HIS ROUTE BEFORE HE LEFT IRELAND WHEREAS THEY SEEMED TO HAVE NO FIXED OBJECT BUT TO BE ALWAYS GOING SOMEWHERE IT APPEARED THAT THEY HAD THOUGHT OF VENICE BUT WERE EASILY DIVERTED FROM IT BY
6967-50152-0030 HIS DESIGN OF COASTING THE EASTERN BANK OF THE LAGO DI COMO AND SO ACROSS THE STELVIO INTO THE TYROL
6967-50152-0031 ALL TOGETHER AS FAR AS BOTZEN WHENCE PHILIP WOULD TURN SOUTHWARD BY THE MOUNTAIN PATHS WHILE THEY WOULD PROCEED TO INNSBRUCK ON THEIR RETURN HOME AMABEL WAS ESPECIALLY PLEASED TO STAY A LITTLE LONGER ON THE BANKS OF THE LAKE
6967-50152-0032 AND IF SHE SECRETLY THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANTER WITHOUT A THIRD PERSON SHE WAS GRATIFIED TO SEE HOW MUCH GUY'S MANNER HAD SOFTENED PHILIP'S INJUSTICE AND DISTRUST MAKING EVERYTHING SO SMOOTH AND SATISFACTORY
6967-50152-0033 SHE TOLD HER HUSBAND THAT SHE THOUGHT HIS EXPERIMENT HAD NOT FAILED SHE WAS MAKING THE BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE CAPTAIN CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SHE TOLD HIM GUY WAS GONE TO SETTLE THEIR PLANS WITH ARNAUD AFTER LINGERING A LITTLE BY THE WINDOW PHILIP TURNED AND WITH MORE ABRUPTNESS THAN
6967-50152-0034 WAS USUAL WITH HIM SAID YOU DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY CAUSE OF ANXIETY ABOUT LAURA NO CERTAINLY NOT SAID AMY SURPRISED SHE HAS NOT BEEN LOOKING WELL LATELY BUT DOCTOR MAYERNE SAYS IT IS NOTHING AND YOU KNOW' SHE BLUSHED AND LOOKED DOWN
6967-50152-0035 WERE MANY THINGS TO MAKE THIS A TRYING TIME IS SHE QUITE STRONG CAN SHE DO AS MUCH AS USUAL SHE DOES MORE THAN EVER MAMMA IS ONLY AFRAID OF HER OVERWORKING HERSELF BUT SHE NEVER ALLOWS THAT SHE IS TIRED
6967-50152-0036 BESIDES WALKING TO EAST HILL ON THURSDAY TO HELP IN THE SINGING AND SHE IS GETTING DREADFULLY LEARNED GUY GAVE HER HIS OLD MATHEMATICAL BOOKS AND CHARLIE ALWAYS CALLS HER MISS PARABOLA PHILIP WAS SILENT KNOWING TOO WELL WHY SHE SOUGHT TO STIFLE CARE IN EMPLOYMENT
6967-50152-0037 AND FEELING EMBITTERED AGAINST THE WHOLE WORLD AGAINST HER FATHER AGAINST HIS OWN CIRCUMSTANCES AGAINST THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS NAY PERHAPS AGAINST THE PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD MADE HIM WHAT HE WAS
6967-50152-0038 HOW EXCLAIMED BOTH PHILIP AND AMY I HAVE JUST HEARD THAT THERE IS A FEVER AT SONDRIO AND ALL THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND EVERY ONE SAYS IT WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH TO EXPOSE OURSELVES TO IT WHAT SHALL WE DO INSTEAD SAID AMY I TOLD ARNAUD
6967-50152-0039 KNOW IN AN HOUR'S TIME I THOUGHT OF VENICE VENICE OH YES DELIGHTFUL
6967-50152-0040 I SAY THAT I CANNOT SEE ANY OCCASION FOR OUR BEING FRIGHTENED
6967-50152-0041 WELL FED HEALTHY PERSONS MERELY PASSING THROUGH THE COUNTRY YOU SEE WE COULD HARDLY MANAGE WITHOUT SLEEPING THERE SAID GUY WE MUST SLEEP EITHER AT COLICO OR AT MADONNA NOW COLICO THEY SAY IS A MOST UNHEALTHY PLACE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
6967-50152-0042 AND MADONNA IS THE VERY HEART OF THE FEVER SONDRIO NOT MUCH BETTER I DON'T SEE HOW IT IS TO BE SAFELY DONE AND THOUGH VERY LIKELY WE MIGHT NOT CATCH THE FEVER I DON'T SEE ANY USE IN TRYING THAT IS MAKING YOURSELF A SLAVE TO THE FEAR OF INFECTION
6967-50152-0043 I DON'T KNOW WHAT PURPOSE WOULD BE ANSWERED BY RUNNING THE RISK SAID GUY IF YOU CHOSE TO GIVE IT SO DIGNIFIED A NAME AS A RISK SAID PHILIP I DON'T THEN SAID GUY SMILING I SHOULD NOT CARE IF THERE WAS ANY REASON FOR GOING THERE BUT AS THERE IS NOT I SHALL FACE MISTER
6967-50152-0044 EDMONSTONE BETTER IF I DON'T RUN AMY INTO ANY MORE CHANCES OF MISCHIEF IS AMY GRATEFUL FOR THE CARE SAID PHILIP AFTER ALL HER WISHES FOR THE EASTERN BANK AMY IS A GOOD WIFE SAID GUY FOR VENICE THEN I'LL RING FOR ARNAUD YOU WILL COME WITH US WON'T YOU PHILIP
6967-50152-0045 TO BE SUFFICIENT TO DETER O PHILIP YOU SURELY WILL NOT SAID AMY MY MIND IS MADE UP AMY THANK YOU I WISH YOU WOULD BE PERSUADED SAID GUY I SHOULD LIKE PARTICULARLY TO HAVE YOU TO LIONIZE US THERE AND I DON'T FANCY YOUR RUNNING INTO DANGER
6967-50152-0046 THE ARGUMENT LASTED LONG PHILIP BY NO MEANS APPROVED OF VENICE ESPECIALLY AFTER THE LONG LOITERING AT MUNICH THINKING THAT IN BOTH PLACES THERE WAS DANGER OF GUY'S BEING LED INTO MISCHIEF BY HIS MUSICAL CONNECTIONS THEREFORE HE DID HIS BEST FOR AMABEL'S SAKE
6967-50152-0047 TO TURN THEM FROM THEIR PURPOSE PERSUADED IN HIS OWN MIND THAT THE FEVER WAS A MERE BUGBEAR RAISED UP BY ARNAUD AND PERHAPS IN HIS FULL HEALTH AND STRENGTH ALMOST REGARDING ILLNESS ITSELF AS A FOIBLE FAR MORE THE DREAD OF IT
6967-50152-0048 HE ARGUED THEREFORE IN HIS MOST PROVOKING STRAIN BECOMING MORE VEXATIOUS AS THE FORMER ANNOYANCE WAS REVIVED AT FINDING THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF MAKING GUY SWERVE FROM HIS PURPOSE WHILE ADDITIONAL MISTS OF SUSPICION AROSE BEFORE HIM
6967-50152-0049 NAY THAT HIS COUSIN WANTED TO ESCAPE FROM HIS SURVEILLANCE AND FOLLOW THE BEAT OF HIS INCLINATIONS AND THE WHOLE HEAP OF PREJUDICES AND HALF REFUTED ACCUSATIONS RESUMED THEIR FULL ASCENDANCY NEVER HAD HIS MANNER BEEN MORE VEXATIOUS
6967-50152-0050 THOUGH WITHOUT DEPARTING FROM THE COOLNESS WHICH ALWAYS CHARACTERIZED IT BUT ALL THE TIME GUY WHILE FIRM AND UNMOVED IN PURPOSE KEPT HIS TEMPER PERFECTLY AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT EFFORT EVEN AMABEL GLOWED WITH INDIGNATION AT THE ASSUMPTION
6967-50152-0051 WITH WHICH HE WAS STRIVING TO PUT HER HUSBAND DOWN THOUGH SHE REJOICED TO SEE ITS ENTIRE FAILURE FOR SOME SENSIBLE ARGUMENT OR SOME GAY LIVELY GOOD HUMOURED REPLY
6967-50152-0052 VERY BEHAVIOUR WHICH USED TO CAUSE HIM SO MANY STRUGGLES HAVING ONCE SERIOUSLY SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK IT RIGHT TO RUN INTO DANGER WITHOUT ADEQUATE CAUSE HE HELD HIS POSITION WITH SO MUCH EASE THAT HE COULD AFFORD TO BE PLAYFUL AND LAUGH AT HIS OWN DREAD OF INFECTION
6967-50152-0053 HIS CHANGEABLENESS AND CREDULITY NEVER HAD TEMPER BEEN MORE ENTIRELY SUBDUED FOR SURELY IF HE COULD BEAR THIS HE NEED NEVER FEAR HIMSELF AGAIN SO PASSED THE HOUR AND AMABEL WAS HEARTILY GLAD WHEN THE DEBATE WAS CLOSED BY ARNAUD'S COMING FOR ORDERS
6967-50152-0054 TO LET FALL A FEW CRUMBS OF COUNSEL OR COMMENDATION FOR SILLY LITTLE AMY WELL AMY YOU YIELDED VERY AMIABLY AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND IT BEST TO SUBMIT
6967-50152-0055 HE GOT NO FURTHER IN HIS INTENDED WARNING AGAINST THE DISSIPATIONS OF VENICE FOR HER EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM AT FIRST WITH A LOOK OF EXTREME WONDER THEN HER FACE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF DIGNITY AND GENTLY BUT GRAVELY SHE SAID I THINK YOU FORGET TO WHOM YOU ARE SPEAKING
6967-50152-0056 THE GENTLEMANLIKE INSTINCT MADE HIM REPLY I BEG YOUR PARDON' AND THERE HE STOPPED AS MUCH TAKEN BY SURPRISE AS IF A DOVE HAD FLOWN IN HIS FACE HE ACTUALLY WAS CONFUSED FOR IN VERY TRUTH
6967-50152-0057 HE HAD AFTER A FASHION FORGOTTEN THAT SHE WAS LADY MORVILLE NOT THE COUSIN AMY WITH WHOM GUY'S CHARACTER MIGHT BE FREELY DISCUSSED HE HAD OFTEN PRESUMED AS FAR WITH HIS AUNT BUT SHE THOUGH ALWAYS TURNING THE CONVERSATION HAD NEVER GIVEN HIM A REBUFF AMABEL HAD NOT DONE
6967-50152-0058 AND IN HER SOFT VOICE FIRMLY THOUGH NOT ANGRILY SHE SPOKE ON ONE THING I WISH TO SAY BECAUSE WE SHALL NEVER SPEAK ON THIS SUBJECT AGAIN AND I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF YOU BEFORE YOU HAVE ALWAYS MISUNDERSTOOD HIM I MIGHT ALMOST SAY CHOSEN TO MISUNDERSTAND HIM
6967-50152-0059 IT IS NOT BECAUSE I AM HIS WIFE THAT I SAY THIS INDEED I AM NOT SURE IT BECOMES ME TO SAY IT YET I CANNOT BEAR THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE TOLD OF IT BECAUSE YOU THINK HE ACTS OUT OF ENMITY TO YOU YOU LITTLE KNOW HOW YOUR FRIENDSHIP
6967-50152-0060 HOW AFTER ALL YOU HAVE DONE AND WRITTEN HE DEFENDED YOU WITH ALL HIS MIGHT WHEN THOSE AT HOME WERE ANGRY HOW HE SOUGHT YOU OUT ON PURPOSE TO TRY TO BE REAL CORDIAL FRIENDS PHILIP'S FACE HAD GROWN RIGID AND CHIEFLY AT THE WORDS THOSE AT HOME WERE ANGRY
6967-50152-0061 IT IS HIS OWN WANT OF OPENNESS MY OPINION HAS NEVER CHANGED NO I KNOW IT HAS NEVER CHANGED SAID AMY IN A TONE OF SORROWFUL DISPLEASURE WHENEVER IT DOES YOU WILL BE SORRY YOU HAVE JUDGED HIM SO HARSHLY
6967-50152-0062 SHE LEFT THE ROOM AND PHILIP HELD HER IN HIGHER ESTEEM HE SAW THERE WAS SPIRIT AND SUBSTANCE BENEATH THAT SOFT GIRLISH EXTERIOR AND HOPED SHE WOULD BETTER BE ABLE TO ENDURE THE TROUBLES WHICH HER PRECIPITATE MARRIAGE WAS LIKELY TO CAUSE HER BUT
6967-50152-0063 HIS COMBINED FICKLENESS AND OBSTINACY HAD ONLY BECOME MORE APPARENT THAN EVER FICKLENESS IN FORSAKING HIS PURPOSE OBSTINACY IN ADHERENCE TO HIS OWN WILL DISPLEASED AND CONTEMPTUOUS
6967-50152-0064 PHILIP WAS NOT SOFTENED BY GUY'S FREEDOM AND OPENNESS OF MANNER AND DESIRE TO HELP HIM AS FAR AS THEIR ROADS LAY TOGETHER HE WAS GRACIOUS ONLY TO LADY MORVILLE WHOM HE TREATED WITH KINDNESS
6967-50152-0065 WHICH BECAME HER POSITION WELL THOUGH IT COULD NOT HURT HIM PERHAPS SHE THOUGHT THIS AMIABILITY ESPECIALLY INSUFFERABLE FOR WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT VARENNA HER CHIEF THOUGHT WAS THAT HERE THEY SHOULD BE FREE OF HIM
6967-50152-0066 COME PHILIP SAID GUY AT THAT LAST MOMENT I WISH YOU WOULD THINK BETTER OF IT AFTER ALL AND COME WITH US TO MILAN THANK YOU MY MIND IS MADE UP WELL MIND YOU DON'T CATCH THE FEVER FOR I DON'T WANT THE TROUBLE OF NURSING YOU
6967-50152-0067 THANK YOU I HOPE TO REQUIRE NO SUCH SERVICES OF MY FRIENDS SAID PHILIP WITH A PROUD STEM AIR IMPLYING I DON'T WANT YOU GOOD BYE THEN SAID GUY THEN REMEMBERING HIS PROMISE TO LAURA HE ADDED I WISH WE COULD HAVE SEEN MORE OF YOU
6967-50152-0068 THEY WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR OF YOU AT HOLLYWELL YOU HAVE HAD ONE WARM FRIEND THERE ALL ALONG HE WAS TOUCHED FOR A MOMENT BY THIS KIND SPEECH AND HIS TONE WAS LESS GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED REMEMBER ME TO THEM WHEN YOU WRITE HE ANSWERED AND TELL LAURA

6967-50152-0070 AND LITTLE MARVEL IF HE SHOULD ABUSE HIS ADVANTAGES POOR LITTLE AMY I HAVE LESS HOPE THAN EVER SINCE EVEN HER EVIDENT WISHES COULD NOT BEND HIS DETERMINATION IN THIS TRIFLE BUT SHE IS A GOOD LITTLE CREATURE HAPPY IN HER BLINDNESS MAY IT LONG CONTINUE
6967-50152-0071 IT IS MY UNCLE AND AUNT WHO ARE TO BE BLAMED HE SET HIMSELF TO ASCEND THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THEY LOOKED BACK WATCHING THE FIRM VIGOROUS STEPS WITH WHICH HE CLIMBED THE HILL SIDE THEN STOOD TO WAVE HIS HAND TO AMABEL LOOKING A PERFECT SPECIMEN OF HEALTH AND ACTIVITY
6967-50152-0072 JUST LIKE HIMSELF SAID AMY DRAWING SO LONG A BREATH THAT GUY SMILED BUT DID NOT SPEAK ARE YOU MUCH VEXED SAID SHE

6967-50152-0074 I COULD NOT LET HIM GO ON GUY WAS SO MUCH DIVERTED AT THE IDEA OF HER WANTING A LECTURE ON WIFE LIKE DEPORTMENT THAT HE HAD NO TIME TO BE ANGRY AT THE IMPERTINENCE AND HE MADE HER LAUGH ALSO BY HIS VIEW THAT WAS ALL FORCE OF HABIT NOW GUIDO GOOD
6967-50152-0075 ONLY SAY YOU ARE VERY GLAD HE IS GONE HIS OWN WAY ON THE CONTRARY I AM SORRY HE IS RUNNING HIS HEAD INTO A FEVER SAID GUY PRETENDING TO BE PROVOKING
