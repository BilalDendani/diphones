6539-66421-0000 THE INCREDIBLE WORDS WERE SPOKEN THAT EVENING
6539-66421-0001 SHE FELT COLD THAT SUMMER EVENING AND HAD THE FIRE LIGHTED SHE SAT GAZING INTO THE BRIGHT COALS WITH THAT STILLNESS OF ATTITUDE WHICH WAS A SURE SIGN WITH HER OF TENSE EMOTION THE MOMENT SO EAGERLY LOOKED FOR HAD COME AND IT WAS OVER
6539-66421-0002 SHE WAS ALONE NOW IN HER REMOTE LITTLE VILLAGE OUT OF THE WORLD IN THE HILLS AND MORE ALONE THAN SHE HAD BEEN SINCE WILLOUGHBY SAILED ON THAT AUGUST MORNING DOWN THE SALCOMBE ESTUARY
6539-66421-0003 FROM THE TIME OF WILLOUGHBY'S COMING SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD NIGHT AND DAY TO THE ONE HALF HOUR DURING WHICH HARRY FEVERSHAM WOULD BE WITH HER THE HALF HOUR HAD COME AND PASSED SHE KNEW NOW HOW SHE HAD COUNTED UPON ITS COMING HOW SHE HAD LIVED FOR IT
6539-66421-0004 SHE FELT LONELY IN A RATHER EMPTY WORLD BUT IT WAS PART OF HER NATURE THAT SHE HAD FORESEEN THIS SENSE OF LONELINESS SHE HAD KNOWN THAT THERE WOULD BE A BAD HOUR FOR HER AFTER SHE HAD SENT HARRY FEVERSHAM AWAY
6539-66421-0005 THAT ALL HER HEART AND SOUL WOULD CLAMOUR TO HER TO CALL HIM BACK AND SHE FORCED HERSELF AS SHE SAT SHIVERING BY THE FIRE TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS FORESEEN AND HAD ALWAYS LOOKED BEYOND IT
6539-66421-0006 TO MORROW SHE WOULD KNOW AGAIN THAT THEY HAD NOT PARTED FOREVER TO MORROW SHE WOULD COMPARE THE PARTING OF TO DAY WITH THE PARTING ON THE NIGHT OF THE BALL AT LENNON HOUSE AND RECOGNISE WHAT A SMALL THING THIS WAS TO THAT
6539-66421-0007 SHE FELL TO WONDERING WHAT HARRY FEVERSHAM WOULD DO NOW THAT HE HAD RETURNED AND WHILE SHE WAS BUILDING UP FOR HIM A FUTURE OF GREAT DISTINCTION SHE FELT DERMOD'S OLD COLLIE DOG NUZZLING AT HER HAND WITH HIS SURE INSTINCT THAT HIS MISTRESS WAS IN DISTRESS
6539-66421-0008 HE WAS VERY OLD SHE THOUGHT HE WOULD DIE SOON AND LEAVE HER AND THEN THERE WOULD BE YEARS AND YEARS PERHAPS BEFORE SHE LAY DOWN IN HER BED AND KNEW THE GREAT MOMENT WAS AT HAND THERE CAME A KNOCK UPON THE DOOR AND A SERVANT TOLD HER THAT COLONEL DURRANCE WAS WAITING
6539-66421-0009 YES SHE SAID AND AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM SHE WENT FORWARD TO MEET HIM SHE DID NOT SHIRK THE PART WHICH SHE HAD ALLOTTED TO HERSELF SHE STEPPED OUT FROM THE SECRET CHAMBER OF HER GRIEF AS SOON AS SHE WAS SUMMONED
6539-66421-0010 SHE TALKED WITH HER VISITOR AS THOUGH NO UNUSUAL THING HAD HAPPENED AN HOUR BEFORE SHE EVEN TALKED OF THEIR MARRIAGE AND THE REBUILDING OF LENNON HOUSE IT WAS DIFFICULT BUT SHE HAD GROWN USED TO DIFFICULTIES
6539-66421-0011 ONLY THAT NIGHT DURRANCE MADE HER PATH A LITTLE HARDER TO TREAD HE ASKED HER AFTER THE MAID HAD BROUGHT IN THE TEA TO PLAY TO HIM THE MUSOLINE OVERTURE UPON HER VIOLIN NOT TO NIGHT SAID ETHNE I
6539-66421-0012 AND SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN BEFORE SHE CHANGED HER MIND
6539-66421-0013 THE SMALL THINGS WITH THEIR DAILY HAPPENINGS WERE JUST THOSE ABOUT WHICH SHE MUST BE MOST CAREFUL STILL I THINK THAT I CAN PLAY THE OVERTURE SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AND SHE TOOK DOWN HER VIOLIN SHE PLAYED THE OVERTURE THROUGH FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END
6539-66421-0014 DURRANCE STOOD AT THE WINDOW WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS HER UNTIL SHE HAD ENDED THEN HE WALKED TO HER SIDE I WAS RATHER A BRUTE HE SAID QUIETLY TO ASK YOU TO PLAY THAT OVERTURE TO NIGHT I WASN'T ANXIOUS TO PLAY SHE ANSWERED AS SHE LAID THE VIOLIN ASIDE I KNOW
6539-66421-0015 BUT I WAS ANXIOUS TO FIND OUT SOMETHING AND I KNEW NO OTHER WAY OF FINDING IT OUT
6539-66421-0016 SHE ASKED IN A VOICE OF SUSPENSE YOU ARE SO SELDOM OFF YOUR GUARD ONLY INDEED AT RARE TIMES WHEN YOU PLAY ONCE BEFORE WHEN YOU PLAYED THAT OVERTURE YOU WERE OFF YOUR GUARD
6539-66421-0017 I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD GET YOU TO PLAY IT AGAIN TO NIGHT THE OVERTURE WHICH WAS ONCE STRUMMED OUT IN A DINGY CAFE AT WADI HALFA TO NIGHT AGAIN I SHOULD FIND YOU OFF YOUR GUARD
6539-66421-0018 HIS WORDS TOOK HER BREATH AWAY AND THE COLOUR FROM HER CHEEKS SHE GOT UP SLOWLY FROM HER CHAIR AND STARED AT HIM WIDE EYED HE COULD NOT KNOW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE DID NOT KNOW BUT DURRANCE WENT QUIETLY ON WELL DID YOU TAKE BACK YOUR FEATHER THE FOURTH ONE
6539-66421-0019 DURRANCE SPOKE THEM WITH A SMILE UPON HIS FACE IT TOOK HER A LONG TIME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY SPOKEN THEM SHE WAS NOT SURE AT THE FIRST THAT HER OVERSTRAINED SENSES WERE NOT PLAYING HER TRICKS BUT HE REPEATED HIS QUESTION
6539-66421-0020 AND SHE COULD NO LONGER DISBELIEVE OR MISUNDERSTAND WHO TOLD YOU OF ANY FOURTH FEATHER SHE ASKED TRENCH HE ANSWERED I MET HIM AT DOVER BUT HE ONLY TOLD ME OF THE FOURTH FEATHER SAID DURRANCE I KNEW OF THE THREE BEFORE
6539-66421-0021 TRENCH WOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD ME OF THE FOURTH HAD I NOT KNOWN OF THE THREE FOR I SHOULD NOT HAVE MET HIM AS HE LANDED FROM THE STEAMER AT DOVER I SHOULD NOT HAVE ASKED HIM WHERE IS HARRY FEVERSHAM AND FOR ME TO KNOW OF THE THREE WAS ENOUGH
6539-66421-0022 HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE CRIED IN A KIND OF DESPAIR AND COMING CLOSE TO HER HE TOOK GENTLY HOLD OF HER ARM BUT SINCE I KNOW HE PROTESTED WHAT DOES IT MATTER HOW I KNOW
6539-66421-0023 I HAVE KNOWN A LONG WHILE EVER SINCE CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY CAME TO THE POOL WITH THE FIRST FEATHER I WAITED TO TELL YOU THAT I KNEW UNTIL HARRY FEVERSHAM CAME BACK AND HE CAME TO DAY
6539-66421-0024 SHE WAS STUNNED BY DURRANCE'S UNEXPECTED DISCLOSURE SHE HAD SO CAREFULLY GUARDED HER SECRET THAT TO REALISE THAT FOR A YEAR IT HAD BEEN NO SECRET CAME AS A SHOCK TO HER BUT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HER CONFUSION SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE MUST HAVE TIME
6539-66421-0025 TO GATHER UP HER FACULTIES AGAIN UNDER COMMAND SO SHE SPOKE OF THE UNIMPORTANT THING TO GAIN THE TIME YOU WERE IN THE CHURCH THEN OR YOU HEARD US UPON THE STEPS OR YOU MET HIM AS HE RODE AWAY NOT ONE OF THE CONJECTURES IS RIGHT SAID DURRANCE WITH A SMILE
6539-66421-0026 DURRANCE HAD HIS VANITIES LIKE OTHERS AND IN PARTICULAR ONE VANITY WHICH HAD SPRUNG UP WITHIN HIM SINCE HE HAD BECOME BLIND HE PRIDED HIMSELF UPON THE QUICKNESS OF HIS PERCEPTION
6539-66421-0027 IT WAS A DELIGHT TO HIM TO MAKE DISCOVERIES WHICH NO ONE EXPECTED A MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS SIGHT TO MAKE AND TO ANNOUNCE THEM UNEXPECTEDLY IT WAS AN ADDITIONAL PLEASURE TO RELATE TO HIS PUZZLED AUDIENCE THE STEPS BY WHICH HE HAD REACHED HIS DISCOVERY NOT ONE OF YOUR CONJECTURES IS RIGHT
6539-66421-0028 THEN HOW DID YOU FIND OUT SHE ASKED I KNEW FROM TRENCH THAT HARRY FEVERSHAM WOULD COME SOME DAY AND SOON I PASSED THE CHURCH THIS AFTERNOON YOUR COLLIE DOG BARKED AT ME SO I KNEW YOU WERE INSIDE BUT A SADDLED HORSE WAS TIED UP BESIDE THE GATE
6539-66421-0029 SO SOME ONE ELSE WAS WITH YOU AND NOT ANY ONE FROM THE VILLAGE THEN I GOT YOU TO PLAY AND THAT TOLD ME WHO IT WAS WHO RODE THE HORSE YES
6539-66421-0030 SHE HAD BARELY LISTENED TO HIS WORDS YES I SEE THEN IN A DEFINITE VOICE WHICH SHOWED THAT SHE HAD REGAINED ALL HER SELF CONTROL SHE SAID
6539-66421-0031 YOU WENT AWAY JUST AFTER CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY CAME WAS THAT THE REASON WHY YOU WENT AWAY I WENT BECAUSE NEITHER YOU NOR I COULD HAVE KEPT UP THE GAME OF PRETENCES WE WERE PLAYING YOU WERE PRETENDING THAT YOU HAD NO THOUGHT FOR HARRY FEVERSHAM
6539-66421-0032 THAT YOU HARDLY CARED WHETHER HE WAS ALIVE OR DEAD I WAS PRETENDING NOT TO HAVE FOUND OUT THAT BEYOND EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD YOU CARED FOR HIM SOME DAY OR OTHER WE SHOULD HAVE FAILED EACH ONE IN TURN I DARED NOT FAIL NOR DARED YOU
6539-66421-0033 I COULD NOT LET YOU WHO HAD SAID TWO LIVES MUST NOT BE SPOILT BECAUSE OF ME LIVE THROUGH A YEAR THINKING THAT TWO LIVES HAD BEEN SPOILT YOU ON YOUR SIDE DARED NOT LET ME WHO HAD SAID MARRIAGE BETWEEN A BLIND MAN AND A WOMAN IS ONLY POSSIBLE
6539-66421-0034 WHEN THERE IS MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP ON BOTH SIDES KNOW THAT UPON ONE SIDE THERE WAS ONLY FRIENDSHIP AND WE WERE SO NEAR TO FAILING SO I WENT AWAY
6539-66421-0035 IT WAS ONLY I WHO FAILED SHE BLAMED HERSELF MOST BITTERLY SHE HAD SET HERSELF AS THE ONE THING WORTH DOING AND INCUMBENT ON HER TO DO TO GUARD THIS MAN FROM KNOWLEDGE WHICH WOULD SET THE CROWN ON HIS CALAMITIES AND SHE HAD FAILED
6539-66421-0036 HE HAD SET HIMSELF TO PROTECT HER FROM THE COMPREHENSION THAT SHE HAD FAILED AND HE HAD SUCCEEDED IT WAS NOT ANY MERE SENSE OF HUMILIATION
6539-66421-0037 WHICH TROUBLED HER BUT SHE FELT THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE SUCCEEDED SINCE BY FAILURE SHE HAD ROBBED HIM OF HIS LAST CHANCE OF HAPPINESS THERE LAY THE STING FOR HER BUT IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT HE SAID ONCE OR TWICE AS I SAID YOU WERE OFF YOUR GUARD
6539-66421-0038 BUT THE CONVINCING FACTS WERE NOT REVEALED TO ME IN THAT WAY WHEN YOU PLAYED THE MUSOLINE OVERTURE BEFORE ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY WHEN WILLOUGHBY BROUGHT YOU SUCH GOOD NEWS I TOOK TO MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS OF YOURS WHICH INSPIRED YOUR PLAYING YOU MUST NOT BLAME YOURSELF
6539-66421-0039 ON THE CONTRARY YOU SHOULD BE GLAD THAT I HAVE FOUND OUT GLAD SHE EXCLAIMED YES FOR MY SAKE GLAD AND AS SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN WONDERMENT HE WENT ON TWO LIVES SHOULD NOT BE SPOILT BECAUSE OF YOU HAD YOU HAD YOUR WAY HAD I NOT FOUND OUT
6539-66421-0040 BECAUSE OF YOUR LOYALTY THREE YOURS YES YES YOURS FEVERSHAM'S AND MINE IT WAS HARD ENOUGH TO KEEP THE PRETENCE DURING THE FEW WEEKS WE WERE IN DEVONSHIRE
6539-66421-0041 WHEN I WENT TO LONDON TO SEE MY OCULIST IT WAS A RELIEF IT GAVE YOU A PAUSE A REST WHEREIN TO DROP PRETENCE AND BE YOURSELF
6539-66421-0042 BUT WHAT WHEN WE CAME TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF AND THERE WERE NO VISITS TO THE OCULIST WHEN WE SAW EACH OTHER EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY SOONER OR LATER THE TRUTH MUST HAVE COME TO ME
6539-66421-0043 IT MIGHT HAVE COME GRADUALLY A SUSPICION ADDED TO A SUSPICION AND ANOTHER TO THAT UNTIL NO DOUBT WAS LEFT OR IT MIGHT HAVE FLASHED OUT IN ONE TERRIBLE MOMENT
6539-66421-0044 YOU AIMED AT A COMPENSATION
6539-66421-0045 THE ARMY THE SPECIAL SERVICE IN THE STRANGE QUARTERS OF THE WORLD A FINE COMPENSATION TO SIT IN FRONT OF YOU KNOWING YOU HAD MARRIED A CRIPPLE OUT OF PITY
6539-66421-0046 AND THAT IN SO DOING YOU HAD CRIPPLED YOURSELF AND FOREGONE THE HAPPINESS WHICH IS YOURS BY RIGHT WHEREAS NOW WHEREAS NOW SHE REPEATED I REMAIN YOUR FRIEND
6539-66421-0047 YOU SENT HARRY AWAY THIS AFTERNOON SAID DURRANCE YOU SAID GOOD BYE TO HIM TWICE
6539-66421-0048 BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK DURRANCE EXPLAINED ONCE IN THE CHURCH AGAIN UPON YOUR VIOLIN AND HE TOOK UP THE INSTRUMENT FROM THE CHAIR ON WHICH SHE HAD LAID IT
6539-66421-0049 I STOOD AT THE WINDOW WHILE YOU PLAYED IT
6539-66421-0050 AND YET IT WAS NOBLY SAD IT WAS TRUE MUSIC IT DID NOT COMPLAIN HE LAID THE VIOLIN DOWN UPON THE CHAIR AGAIN I AM GOING TO SEND A MESSENGER TO RATHMULLEN HARRY CANNOT CROSS LOUGH SWILLY TO NIGHT THE MESSENGER WILL BRING HIM BACK TO MORROW
6539-66421-0051 AS DURRANCE BENT DOWN TOWARDS HER HE BECAME AWARE THAT SHE WAS CRYING SILENTLY FOR ONCE TEARS HAD THEIR WAY WITH HER HE TOOK HIS CAP AND WALKED NOISELESSLY TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM
6539-66421-0052 DON'T GO FOR A MOMENT SHE SAID AND SHE LEFT THE FIREPLACE AND CAME TO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM THE OCULIST AT WIESBADEN SHE ASKED HE GAVE YOU A HOPE DURRANCE STOOD MEDITATING WHETHER HE SHOULD LIE OR SPEAK THE TRUTH NO HE SAID AT LENGTH THERE IS NO HOPE
6539-66421-0053 I CAN GET ABOUT CAN'T I PERHAPS ONE OF THESE DAYS I SHALL GO ON A JOURNEY ONE OF THE LONG JOURNEYS AMONGST THE STRANGE PEOPLE IN THE EAST
