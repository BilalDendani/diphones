5043-28396-0002 IN THE TIMES OF THE CHIVALRY WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE MEN GLORIED IN PROTECTING THE WOMEN AND THE WOMEN THOUGHT THEMSELVES SAFE AND HAPPY WHEN THEY OBTAINED THAT PROTECTION IT IS PROBABLE THEREFORE THAT THIS CUSTOM
5043-28396-0003 ALMOST ALL EUROPE HAS JOINED IN DISTINGUISHING IT BY SOME PARTICULAR CEREMONY AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS ABOUT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN THE GENIAL INFLUENCES OF THE SPRING BEGIN TO OPERATE IT HAS BEEN BELIEVED BY THE VULGAR THAT UPON IT THE BIRDS

5043-28396-0007 FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCUSSING IN THE MOST FORMAL AND SERIOUS MANNER BEAUTIFUL AND SUBTLE QUESTIONS OF LOVE THEY DECIDED THE PRECISE AMOUNT OF INCONSTANCY WHICH A LADY MIGHT FORGIVE WITHOUT LOWERING HER OWN DIGNITY
5043-28396-0008 PROVIDED HER LOVER MADE CERTAIN SUPPLICATIONS AND PERFORMED CERTAIN PENANCES THEY TOOK IT INTO SOLEMN CONSIDERATION WHETHER A LOVER WAS JUSTIFIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IN EXPRESSING THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT OF HIS LADY'S FIDELITY

5043-28396-0010 TO INSPIRE AFFECTION IMMODESTY AT BABYLON THAT MODESTY AND CHASTITY WHICH WE NOW ESTEEM AS THE CHIEF ORNAMENT OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER DOES NOT APPEAR
5043-28396-0011 IN TIMES OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY TO HAVE BEEN MUCH REGARDED BY EITHER SEX AT BABYLON THE CAPITAL OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE IT WAS SO LITTLE VALUED THAT A LAW OF THE COUNTRY EVEN OBLIGED EVERY WOMAN ONCE IN HER LIFE TO DEPART FROM IT
5043-28396-0012 WAS PROMULGATED BY AN ORACLE ORDAINED THAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD ONCE IN HER LIFE REPAIR TO THE TEMPLE OF VENUS THAT ON HER ARRIVAL THERE HER HEAD SHOULD BE CROWNED WITH FLOWERS AND IN THAT ATTIRE SHE SHOULD WAIT

5043-28396-0015 OR THE REQUEST OF THE STRANGER WHO OFFERED THEM WHATEVER WAS THE VALUE OF THE MONEY OR HOWEVER MEAN OR DISAGREEABLE THE DONOR THESE PRELIMINARIES BEING SETTLED THEY RETIRED TOGETHER TO FULFIL THE LAW AFTER WHICH THE WOMAN RETURNED AND OFFERED THE GODDESS THE SACRIFICE PRESCRIBED BY CUSTOM
5043-28396-0016 IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES A CERTAIN NUMBER ONLY WERE DOOMED TO PROSTITUTION
5043-28396-0017 TO INDUCE THE GODDESS OF DEBAUCHERY TO SAVE THE REST WHEN A WOMAN HAD ONCE ENTERED THE TEMPLE OF VENUS SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO DEPART FROM IT TILL SHE HAD FULFILLED THE LAW AND IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENED THAT THOSE TO WHOM NATURE HAD BEEN LESS INDULGENT THAN TO OTHERS
5043-28396-0018 REMAINED THERE A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY PERSON OFFERED TO PERFORM WITH THEM THE CONDITION OF THEIR RELEASE A CUSTOM WE THINK SOME TIMES ALLUDED TO IN SCRIPTURE AND EXPRESSLY DELINEATED IN THE BOOK OF BARUCH THE WOMEN ALSO WITH CORDS ABOUT THEM

5043-28396-0020 THOUGH THIS INFAMOUS LAW WAS AT FIRST STRICTLY OBSERVED BY ALL THE WOMEN OF BABYLON YET IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN LENGTH OF TIME THEY GREW ASHAMED OF AND IN MANY CASES DISPENSED WITH IT FOR WE ARE INFORMED
5043-28396-0021 THAT WOMEN OF THE SUPERIOR RANKS OF LIFE WHO WERE NOT WILLING LITERALLY TO FULFIL THE LAW WERE ALLOWED A KIND OF EVASION
5043-28396-0022 PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE THE STATUE OF THE GODDESS AND RETURNED HOME POSSIBLY THIS WAS DONE BY THE ASSISTANCE OF A BRIBE TO THOSE WHO HAD THE CARE OF THE TEMPLE INDECENCY AT ADRIANOPLE
