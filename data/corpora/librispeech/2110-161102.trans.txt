2110-161102-0000 SIXTY NINE WE WISH THAT IT WERE IN OUR POWER TO INTRODUCE THE GERMAN TASTE IN MINUETS IN ITALY MINUETS HERE LAST ALMOST AS LONG AS WHOLE SYMPHONIES
2110-161102-0001 TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTER MOZART AS A LAD WAS MAKING A TOUR THROUGH ITALY WITH HIS FATHER THERE MIGHT BE A VALUABLE HINT HERE TOUCHING THE PROPER TEMPO FOR THE MINUETS IN MOZART'S SYMPHONIES
2110-161102-0002 MOZART HIMSELF WAS PLAINLY OF ANOTHER OPINION H E K SEVENTY BEECKE TOLD ME AND IT IS TRUE
2110-161102-0003 THAT MUSIC IS NOW PLAYED IN THE CABINET OF THE EMPEROR
2110-161102-0004 THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF YES SUCH A SHALLOW PATE AS YOU FEELS A PAIN AS SOON AS HE HEARS SOMETHING WHICH HE CAN NOT UNDERSTAND MANNHEIM NOVEMBER THIRTEENTH
2110-161102-0005 SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER BEECKE WAS A CONCEITED PIANIST SEVENTY ONE NOTHING GIVES ME SO MUCH PLEASURE IN THE ANTICIPATION
2110-161102-0006 AS THE CONCERT SPIRITUEL IN PARIS FOR I FANCY I SHALL BE CALLED ON TO COMPOSE SOMETHING THE ORCHESTRA IS SAID TO BE LARGE AND GOOD AND MY PRINCIPAL FAVORITES CAN BE WELL PERFORMED THERE
2110-161102-0007 THAT IS TO SAY CHORUSES AND I AM RIGHT GLAD THAT THE FRENCHMEN ARE FOND OF THEM HERETOFORE PARIS HAS BEEN USED TO THE CHORUSES OF GLUCK DEPEND ON ME
2110-161102-0008 MANNHEIM FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER ON MARCH SEVENTH HE WRITES I HAVE CENTERED ALL MY HOPES ON PARIS
2110-161102-0009 FOR THE GERMAN PRINCES ARE ALL NIGGARDS SEVENTY TWO I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT MY SYMPHONY PLEASES AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DON'T MUCH CARE
2110-161102-0010 WHOM SHOULD IT PLEASE I WARRANT IT WILL PLEASE THE FEW SENSIBLE FRENCHMEN WHO ARE HERE AND THERE WILL BE NO GREAT MISFORTUNE IF IT FAILS TO PLEASE THE STUPIDS
2110-161102-0011 STILL I HAVE SOME HOPE THAT THE ASSES TOO WILL FIND SOMETHING IN IT TO THEIR LIKING PARIS JUNE TWELFTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER
2110-161102-0012 SEVENTY THREE THE MOST OF THE SYMPHONIES ARE NOT TO THE LOCAL TASTE IF I FIND TIME I SHALL REVISE A FEW VIOLIN CONCERTOS SHORTEN THEM FOR OUR TASTE IN GERMANY IS FOR LONG THINGS
2110-161102-0013 AS A MATTER OF FACT SHORT AND GOOD IS BETTER PARIS SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER IN SALZBURG IN THE SAME LETTER HE SAYS
2110-161102-0014 THAT IS TO SAY IN THE MATTER OF COMPOSITION SEVENTY FOUR
2110-161102-0015 IT IS ABOMINABLE GERMAN IS DIVINE IN COMPARISON AND THEN THE SINGERS MEN AND WOMEN THEY ARE UNMENTIONABLE THEY DO NOT SING THEY SHRIEK THEY HOWL WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT THROUGH THROAT NOSE AND GULLET
2110-161102-0016 PARIS JULY NINTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER MOZART WAS THINKING OF WRITING A FRENCH OPERA SEVENTY FIVE
2110-161102-0017 AH IF WE TOO HAD CLARINETS YOU CAN'T CONCEIVE WHAT A WONDERFUL EFFECT A SYMPHONY WITH FLUTES OBOES AND CLARINETS MAKES AT THE FIRST AUDIENCE WITH THE ARCHBISHOP I SHALL HAVE MUCH TO TELL HIM AND
2110-161102-0018 PROBABLY A FEW SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE ALAS OUR MUSIC MIGHT BE MUCH BETTER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL IF ONLY THE ARCHBISHOP WERE WILLING
2110-161102-0019 TO HIS FATHER MOZART WAS ON HIS RETURN TO SALZBURG WHERE HE HAD RECEIVED AN APPOINTMENT IN THE ARCHIEPISCOPAL CHAPEL IT SEEMS THAT WOOD WIND INSTRUMENTS WERE STILL ABSENT FROM THE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IN SALZBURG
2110-161102-0020 SEVENTY SIX OTHERS KNOW AS WELL AS YOU AND I THAT TASTES ARE CONTINUALLY CHANGING AND THAT THE CHANGES EXTEND EVEN INTO CHURCH MUSIC
2110-161102-0021 THIS SHOULD NOT BE BUT IT ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT TRUE CHURCH MUSIC IS NOW FOUND ONLY IN THE ATTIC AND ALMOST EATEN UP BY THE WORMS VIENNA APRIL TWELFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2110-161102-0022 TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS ACTIVE AS COURT CHAPELMASTER IN SALZBURG AND WHO HAD BEEN ASKED BY HIS SON IN THE SAME LETTER WHEN IT GREW A LITTLE WARMER TO LOOK IN THE ATTIC AND SEND SOME OF YOUR HIS CHURCH MUSIC
2110-161102-0023 SEVENTY SEVEN THE THEMES PLEASED ME MOST IN THE SYMPHONY YET IT WILL BE THE LEAST EFFECTIVE FOR THERE IS TOO MUCH IN IT AND A FRAGMENTARY PERFORMANCE OF IT SOUNDS LIKE AN ANT HILL LOOKS
2110-161102-0024 THAT IS AS IF THE DEVIL HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE IN IT IN A LETTER WRITTEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE TO A NOBLEMAN WHO WAS A COMPOSER AND HAD SUBMITTED A SYMPHONY TO MOZART FOR CRITICISM
2110-161102-0025 SEVENTY EIGHT SO FAR AS MELODY IS CONCERNED YES FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT NO MOREOVER THE SCORES WHICH YOU MAY SEE HERE OUTSIDE THOSE OF
2110-161102-0026 AND THERE IS NOTHING FRENCH ABOUT THEM EXCEPT THE WORDS
2110-161102-0027 WHOM MOZART FREQUENTLY FOUND OCCUPIED WITH FRENCH SCORES AND WHO HAD ASKED WHETHER THE STUDY OF ITALIAN SCORES WERE NOT PREFERABLE SEVENTY NINE THE ODE IS ELEVATED
2110-161102-0028 BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING YOU WISH BUT TOO EXAGGERATED AND BOMBASTIC FOR MY EARS BUT WHAT WOULD YOU THE GOLDEN MEAN THE TRUTH IS NO LONGER RECOGNIZED OR VALUED TO WIN APPLAUSE ONE MUST WRITE STUFF SO SIMPLE
2110-161102-0029 THAT A COACHMAN MIGHT SING IT AFTER YOU OR SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT IT PLEASES SIMPLY BECAUSE NO SENSIBLE MAN CAN COMPREHEND IT BUT IT IS NOT THIS THAT I WANTED TO DISCUSS WITH YOU BUT ANOTHER MATTER I HAVE A STRONG DESIRE TO WRITE A BOOK
2110-161102-0030 A LITTLE WORK ON MUSICAL CRITICISM WITH ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES N B NOT UNDER MY NAME VIENNA DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO TO HIS FATHER
2110-161102-0031 A BARDIC SONG BY DENIS ON GIBRALTAR IT IS A SECRET FOR A HUNGARIAN LADY WANTS THUS TO HONOR DENIS

2110-161102-0033 I NEVER HEARD SUCH QUARTET PLAYING AS HERE BUT WHEN ALL THE GENTLEMEN ARE TOGETHER THEY MIGHT DO BETTER
