8742-245707-0000 THREE WHETHER OF MAN'S RIB FOUR WHETHER THE WOMAN WAS MADE IMMEDIATELY BY GOD FIRST ARTICLE
8742-245707-0001 WHETHER THE WOMAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FIRST PRODUCTION OF THINGS OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FIRST PRODUCTION OF THINGS FOR THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
8742-245707-0002 THAT THE FEMALE IS A MISBEGOTTEN MALE BUT NOTHING MISBEGOTTEN OR DEFECTIVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST PRODUCTION OF THINGS THEREFORE WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE AT THAT FIRST PRODUCTION
8742-245707-0003 FURTHER SUBJECTION AND LIMITATION WERE A RESULT OF SIN
8742-245707-0004 IT IS NOT GOOD FOR MAN TO BE ALONE LET US MAKE HIM A HELPER LIKE TO HIMSELF I ANSWER THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR WOMAN TO BE MADE AS THE SCRIPTURE SAYS AS A HELPER TO MAN
8742-245707-0005 NOT INDEED AS A HELPMATE IN OTHER WORKS AS SOME SAY SINCE MAN CAN BE MORE EFFICIENTLY HELPED BY ANOTHER MAN IN OTHER WORKS BUT AS A HELPER IN THE WORK OF GENERATION
8742-245707-0006 THIS CAN BE MADE CLEAR IF WE OBSERVE THE MODE OF GENERATION CARRIED OUT IN VARIOUS LIVING THINGS SOME LIVING THINGS DO NOT POSSESS IN THEMSELVES THE POWER OF GENERATION BUT ARE GENERATED BY SOME OTHER SPECIFIC AGENT
8742-245707-0007 SUCH AS SOME PLANTS AND ANIMALS BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES FROM SOME FITTING MATTER AND NOT FROM SEED OTHERS POSSESS THE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE GENERATIVE POWER TOGETHER AS WE SEE IN PLANTS WHICH ARE GENERATED FROM SEED
8742-245707-0008 FOR THE NOBLEST VITAL FUNCTION IN PLANTS IS GENERATION WHEREFORE WE OBSERVE THAT IN THESE THE ACTIVE POWER OF GENERATION INVARIABLY ACCOMPANIES THE PASSIVE POWER
8742-245707-0009 AMONG PERFECT ANIMALS THE ACTIVE POWER OF GENERATION BELONGS TO THE MALE SEX AND THE PASSIVE POWER TO THE FEMALE AND AS AMONG ANIMALS THERE IS A VITAL OPERATION NOBLER THAN GENERATION TO WHICH THEIR LIFE IS PRINCIPALLY DIRECTED
8742-245707-0010 THEREFORE THE MALE SEX IS NOT FOUND IN CONTINUAL UNION WITH THE FEMALE IN PERFECT ANIMALS BUT ONLY AT THE TIME OF COITION SO THAT WE MAY CONSIDER THAT BY THIS MEANS THE MALE AND FEMALE ARE ONE AS IN PLANTS THEY ARE ALWAYS UNITED
8742-245707-0011 SO THAT THE FEMALE SHOULD BE PRODUCED SEPARATELY FROM THE MALE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CARNALLY UNITED FOR GENERATION THEREFORE DIRECTLY AFTER THE FORMATION OF WOMAN IT WAS SAID AND THEY SHALL BE TWO IN ONE FLESH
8742-245707-0012 AS REGARDS THE INDIVIDUAL NATURE WOMAN IS DEFECTIVE AND MISBEGOTTEN FOR THE ACTIVE FORCE IN THE MALE SEED TENDS TO THE PRODUCTION OF A PERFECT LIKENESS IN THE MASCULINE SEX
8742-245707-0013 ON THE OTHER HAND AS REGARDS HUMAN NATURE IN GENERAL WOMAN IS NOT MISBEGOTTEN BUT IS INCLUDED IN NATURE'S INTENTION AS DIRECTED TO THE WORK OF GENERATION
8742-245707-0014 NOW THE GENERAL INTENTION OF NATURE DEPENDS ON GOD WHO IS THE UNIVERSAL AUTHOR OF NATURE THEREFORE IN PRODUCING NATURE GOD FORMED NOT ONLY THE MALE BUT ALSO THE FEMALE
8742-245707-0015 SUBJECTION IS TWOFOLD ONE IS SERVILE BY VIRTUE OF WHICH A SUPERIOR MAKES USE OF A SUBJECT FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT AND THIS KIND OF SUBJECTION BEGAN AFTER SIN THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF SUBJECTION WHICH IS CALLED ECONOMIC OR CIVIL
8742-245707-0016 WHEREBY THE SUPERIOR MAKES USE OF HIS SUBJECTS FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT AND GOOD AND THIS KIND OF SUBJECTION EXISTED EVEN BEFORE SIN FOR GOOD ORDER WOULD HAVE BEEN WANTING IN THE HUMAN FAMILY IF SOME WERE NOT GOVERNED BY OTHERS WISER THAN THEMSELVES
8742-245707-0017 SO BY SUCH A KIND OF SUBJECTION WOMAN IS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO MAN BECAUSE IN MAN THE DISCRETION OF REASON PREDOMINATES NOR IS INEQUALITY AMONG MEN EXCLUDED BY THE STATE OF INNOCENCE AS WE SHALL PROVE
8742-245707-0018 ESPECIALLY AS GOD IS SO POWERFUL THAT HE CAN DIRECT ANY EVIL TO A GOOD END SECOND ARTICLE
8742-245707-0019 WHETHER WOMAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE FROM MAN OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE FROM MAN FOR SEX BELONGS BOTH TO MAN AND ANIMALS
8742-245707-0020 BUT IN THE OTHER ANIMALS THE FEMALE WAS NOT MADE FROM THE MALE THEREFORE NEITHER SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN SO WITH MAN
8742-245707-0021 FURTHER WOMAN WAS MADE TO BE A HELPMATE TO MAN IN THE WORK OF GENERATION BUT CLOSE RELATIONSHIP MAKES A PERSON UNFIT FOR THAT OFFICE HENCE NEAR RELATIONS ARE DEBARRED FROM INTERMARRIAGE AS IS WRITTEN
8742-245707-0022 THEREFORE WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE FROM MAN ON THE CONTRARY
8742-245707-0023 HE CREATED OF HIM THAT IS OUT OF MAN A HELPMATE LIKE TO HIMSELF THAT IS WOMAN I ANSWER THAT WHEN ALL THINGS WERE FIRST FORMED
8742-245707-0024 THAT AS GOD IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE SO THE FIRST MAN IN LIKENESS TO GOD WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE WHEREFORE PAUL SAYS THAT GOD MADE THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE FROM ONE
8742-245707-0025 ACTS SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX SECONDLY THAT MAN MIGHT LOVE WOMAN ALL THE MORE AND CLEAVE TO HER MORE CLOSELY KNOWING HER TO BE FASHIONED FROM HIMSELF HENCE IT IS WRITTEN
8742-245707-0026 SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF MAN WHEREFORE A MAN SHALL LEAVE FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE THIS WAS MOST NECESSARY AS REGARDS THE HUMAN RACE IN WHICH THE MALE AND FEMALE LIVE TOGETHER FOR LIFE
8742-245707-0027 WHICH IS NOT THE CASE WITH OTHER ANIMALS THIRDLY BECAUSE AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
8742-245707-0028 THE HUMAN MALE AND FEMALE ARE UNITED NOT ONLY FOR GENERATION AS WITH OTHER ANIMALS BUT ALSO FOR THE PURPOSE OF DOMESTIC LIFE IN WHICH EACH HAS HIS OR HER PARTICULAR DUTY AND IN WHICH THE MAN IS THE HEAD OF THE WOMAN
8742-245707-0029 THIS IS A GREAT SACRAMENT BUT I SPEAK IN CHRIST AND IN THE CHURCH
8742-245707-0030 WHEREFORE FROM DETERMINATE MATTER IT PRODUCES SOMETHING IN A DETERMINATE SPECIES ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIVINE POWER BEING INFINITE CAN PRODUCE THINGS OF THE SAME SPECIES OUT OF ANY MATTER SUCH AS A MAN FROM THE SLIME OF THE EARTH AND A WOMAN FROM OUT OF MAN
8742-245707-0031 WHEREFORE EVE IS NOT CALLED THE DAUGHTER OF ADAM AND SO THIS ARGUMENT DOES NOT PROVE THIRD ARTICLE
8742-245707-0032 WHETHER THE WOMAN WAS FITTINGLY MADE FROM THE RIB OF MAN OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FORMED FROM THE RIB OF MAN FOR THE RIB WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE WOMAN'S BODY
8742-245707-0033 FURTHER A RIB CANNOT BE REMOVED FROM MAN WITHOUT PAIN BUT THERE WAS NO PAIN BEFORE SIN
8742-245707-0034 THAT EVE MIGHT BE MADE FROM IT ON THE CONTRARY IT IS WRITTEN
8742-245707-0035 GOD BUILT THE RIB WHICH HE TOOK FROM ADAM INTO A WOMAN I ANSWER THAT IT WAS RIGHT FOR THE WOMAN TO BE MADE FROM A RIB OF MAN FIRST TO SIGNIFY THE SOCIAL UNION OF MAN AND WOMAN
8742-245707-0036 FOR THE WOMAN SHOULD NEITHER USE AUTHORITY OVER MAN AND SO SHE WAS NOT MADE FROM HIS HEAD NOR WAS IT RIGHT FOR HER TO BE SUBJECT TO MAN'S CONTEMPT AS HIS SLAVE AND SO SHE WAS NOT MADE FROM HIS FEET SECONDLY
8742-245707-0037 FOR THE SACRAMENTAL SIGNIFICATION FOR FROM THE SIDE OF CHRIST SLEEPING ON THE CROSS THE SACRAMENTS FLOWED NAMELY BLOOD AND WATER ON WHICH THE CHURCH WAS ESTABLISHED
8742-245707-0038 SOME SAY THAT THE WOMAN'S BODY WAS FORMED BY A MATERIAL INCREASE WITHOUT ANYTHING BEING ADDED IN THE SAME WAY AS OUR LORD MULTIPLIED THE FIVE LOAVES BUT THIS IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
8742-245707-0039 FOR SUCH AN INCREASE OF MATTER WOULD EITHER BE BY A CHANGE OF THE VERY SUBSTANCE OF THE MATTER ITSELF OR BY A CHANGE OF ITS DIMENSIONS NOT BY CHANGE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE MATTER
8742-245707-0040 BOTH BECAUSE MATTER CONSIDERED IN ITSELF IS QUITE UNCHANGEABLE SINCE IT HAS A POTENTIAL EXISTENCE AND HAS NOTHING BUT THE NATURE OF A SUBJECT
8742-245707-0041 WE MUST ADMIT AN ADDITION OF MATTER EITHER BY CREATION
8742-245707-0042 NEVERTHELESS WE SAY THAT THE CROWDS WERE FED WITH FIVE LOAVES OR THAT WOMAN WAS MADE FROM THE RIB BECAUSE AN ADDITION WAS MADE TO THE ALREADY EXISTING MATTER OF THE LOAVES AND OF THE RIB
8742-245707-0043 THE RIB BELONGED TO THE INTEGRAL PERFECTION OF ADAM NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE HUMAN RACE JUST AS THE SEMEN BELONGS TO THE PERFECTION OF THE BEGETTER AND IS RELEASED BY A NATURAL AND PLEASURABLE OPERATION
8742-245707-0044 MUCH MORE THEREFORE WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT BY THE DIVINE POWER THE BODY OF THE WOMAN SHOULD BE PRODUCED FROM THE MAN'S RIB FROM THIS IT IS CLEAR HOW TO ANSWER THE THIRD OBJECTION FOURTH ARTICLE
8742-245707-0045 WHETHER THE WOMAN WAS FORMED IMMEDIATELY BY GOD OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE WOMAN WAS NOT FORMED IMMEDIATELY BY GOD
8742-245707-0046 SAYS THAT CORPOREAL THINGS ARE GOVERNED BY GOD THROUGH THE ANGELS BUT THE WOMAN'S BODY WAS FORMED FROM CORPOREAL MATTER THEREFORE IT WAS MADE THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF THE ANGELS AND NOT IMMEDIATELY BY GOD
8742-245707-0047 FURTHER THOSE THINGS WHICH PRE EXIST IN CREATURES AS TO THEIR CAUSAL VIRTUES ARE PRODUCED BY THE POWER OF SOME CREATURE AND NOT IMMEDIATELY BY GOD
8742-245707-0048 THEREFORE IT WAS NOT PRODUCED IMMEDIATELY BY GOD ON THE CONTRARY AUGUSTINE SAYS IN THE SAME WORK GOD ALONE TO WHOM ALL NATURE OWES ITS EXISTENCE COULD FORM OR BUILD UP THE WOMAN FROM THE MAN'S RIB
8742-245707-0049 THE NATURAL GENERATION OF EVERY SPECIES IS FROM SOME DETERMINATE MATTER NOW THE MATTER WHENCE MAN IS NATURALLY BEGOTTEN IS THE HUMAN SEMEN OF MAN OR WOMAN
8742-245707-0050 WHEREFORE FROM ANY OTHER MATTER AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE HUMAN SPECIES CANNOT NATURALLY BE GENERATED NOW GOD ALONE THE AUTHOR OF NATURE CAN PRODUCE AN EFFECT INTO EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE
8742-245707-0051 THIS ARGUMENT IS VERIFIED WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS BEGOTTEN BY NATURAL GENERATION FROM THAT WHICH IS LIKE IT IN THE SAME SPECIES
8742-245707-0052 AS AUGUSTINE SAYS
8742-245707-0053 WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE ANGELS WERE EMPLOYED BY GOD IN THE FORMATION OF THE WOMAN BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT AS THE BODY OF MAN WAS NOT FORMED BY THE ANGELS FROM THE SLIME OF THE EARTH SO NEITHER WAS THE BODY OF THE WOMAN FORMED BY THEM FROM THE MAN'S RIB
8742-245707-0054 AS AUGUSTINE SAYS
