6088-34571-0000 THE COMPRACHICOS OR COMPRAPEQUENOS WERE A HIDEOUS AND NONDESCRIPT ASSOCIATION OF WANDERERS FAMOUS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
6088-34571-0001 UNHEARD OF IN THE NINETEENTH THE COMPRACHICOS ARE LIKE THE SUCCESSION POWDER AN ANCIENT SOCIAL CHARACTERISTIC DETAIL THEY ARE PART OF OLD HUMAN UGLINESS TO THE GREAT EYE OF HISTORY WHICH SEES EVERYTHING COLLECTIVELY

6088-34571-0003 THE COMPRACHICOS TRADED IN CHILDREN THEY BOUGHT AND SOLD THEM THEY DID NOT STEAL THEM THE KIDNAPPING OF CHILDREN IS ANOTHER BRANCH OF INDUSTRY AND WHAT DID THEY MAKE OF THESE CHILDREN
6088-34571-0004 MONSTERS WHY MONSTERS TO LAUGH AT THE POPULACE MUST NEEDS LAUGH AND KINGS TOO THE MOUNTEBANK IS WANTED IN THE STREETS
6088-34571-0005 WHAT ARE WE SKETCHING IN THESE FEW PRELIMINARY PAGES A CHAPTER IN THE MOST TERRIBLE OF BOOKS A BOOK WHICH MIGHT BE ENTITLED THE FARMING OF THE UNHAPPY BY THE HAPPY
6088-34571-0006 TWO A CHILD DESTINED TO BE A PLAYTHING FOR MEN SUCH A THING HAS EXISTED SUCH A THING EXISTS EVEN NOW IN SIMPLE AND SAVAGE TIMES
6088-34571-0007 SUCH A THING CONSTITUTED AN ESPECIAL TRADE THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY CALLED THE GREAT CENTURY WAS OF THOSE TIMES
6088-34571-0008 IT COMBINED CORRUPT SIMPLICITY WITH DELICATE FEROCITY A CURIOUS VARIETY OF CIVILIZATION A TIGER WITH A SIMPER
6088-34571-0009 HE MUST BE TAKEN EARLY THE DWARF MUST BE FASHIONED WHEN YOUNG WE PLAY WITH CHILDHOOD BUT A WELL FORMED CHILD IS NOT VERY AMUSING A HUNCHBACK IS BETTER FUN
6088-34571-0010 HENCE GREW AN ART THERE WERE TRAINERS WHO TOOK A MAN AND MADE HIM AN ABORTION THEY TOOK A FACE AND MADE A MUZZLE THEY STUNTED GROWTH
6088-34571-0011 OF TERATOLOGICAL CASES HAD ITS RULES IT WAS QUITE A SCIENCE
6088-34571-0012 WHERE GOD HAD PUT A LOOK THEIR ART PUT A SQUINT WHERE GOD HAD MADE HARMONY THEY MADE DISCORD WHERE GOD HAD MADE THE PERFECT PICTURE THEY RE ESTABLISHED THE SKETCH
6088-34571-0013 IN OUR OWN DAYS DO THEY NOT DYE DOGS BLUE AND GREEN NATURE IS OUR CANVAS MAN HAS ALWAYS WISHED TO ADD SOMETHING TO GOD'S WORK MAN RETOUCHES CREATION SOMETIMES FOR BETTER
6088-34571-0014 SOMETIMES FOR WORSE THE COURT BUFFOON WAS NOTHING BUT AN ATTEMPT TO LEAD BACK MAN TO THE MONKEY IT WAS A PROGRESS THE WRONG WAY A MASTERPIECE IN RETROGRESSION
6088-34571-0015 AT THE SAME TIME THEY TRIED TO MAKE A MAN OF THE MONKEY BARBARA DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND AND COUNTESS OF SOUTHAMPTON HAD A MARMOSET FOR A PAGE FRANCES SUTTON BARONESS DUDLEY EIGHTH PEERESS IN THE BENCH OF BARONS
6088-34571-0016 THREE CAPE MONKEYS IN GRAND LIVERY
6088-34571-0017 WHOSE TOILET CARDINAL POLE WITNESSED
6088-34571-0018 THESE MONKEYS RAISED IN THE SCALE WERE A COUNTERPOISE TO MEN BRUTALIZED AND BESTIALIZED THIS PROMISCUOUSNESS OF MAN AND BEAST DESIRED BY THE GREAT
6088-34571-0019 THIS JUXTAPOSITION IS AUTHENTICATED BY A MASS OF DOMESTIC RECORDS NOTABLY BY THE PORTRAIT OF JEFFREY HUDSON DWARF OF HENRIETTA OF FRANCE
6088-34571-0020 TENDS TO DEFORM HIM THE SUPPRESSION OF HIS STATE WAS COMPLETED BY DISFIGUREMENT CERTAIN VIVISECTORS OF THAT PERIOD SUCCEEDED MARVELLOUSLY WELL IN EFFACING FROM THE HUMAN FACE THE DIVINE EFFIGY
6088-34571-0021 DOCTOR CONQUEST MEMBER OF THE AMEN STREET COLLEGE AND JUDICIAL VISITOR OF THE CHEMISTS SHOPS OF LONDON WROTE A BOOK IN LATIN ON THIS PSEUDO SURGERY THE PROCESSES OF WHICH HE DESCRIBES
6088-34571-0022 IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE JUSTUS OF CARRICKFERGUS THE INVENTOR OF THIS BRANCH OF SURGERY WAS A MONK NAMED AVONMORE AN IRISH WORD SIGNIFYING GREAT RIVER THE DWARF OF THE ELECTOR PALATINE
6088-34571-0023 VERY VARIED IN ITS APPLICATIONS IT FASHIONED BEINGS THE LAW OF WHOSE EXISTENCE WAS HIDEOUSLY SIMPLE IT PERMITTED THEM TO SUFFER AND COMMANDED THEM TO AMUSE
6088-34571-0024 THE MANUFACTURE OF MONSTERS WAS PRACTISED ON A LARGE SCALE AND COMPRISED VARIOUS BRANCHES THE SULTAN REQUIRED THEM SO DID THE POPE
6088-34571-0025 UTILIZED THE SAME SPECIES OF MONSTERS FIERCE IN THE FORMER CASE MILD IN THE LATTER THEY KNEW HOW TO PRODUCE THINGS IN THOSE DAYS WHICH ARE NOT PRODUCED NOW THEY HAD TALENTS WHICH WE LACK
6088-34571-0026 AND IT IS NOT WITHOUT REASON THAT SOME GOOD FOLK CRY OUT THAT THE DECLINE HAS COME WE NO LONGER KNOW HOW TO SCULPTURE LIVING HUMAN FLESH THIS IS CONSEQUENT ON THE LOSS OF THE ART OF TORTURE
6088-34571-0027 WE ARE OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THESE EXPERIMENTS NOW AND ARE THUS DEPRIVED OF THE PROGRESS WHICH SURGERY MADE BY AID OF THE EXECUTIONER
6088-34571-0028 THE VIVISECTION OF FORMER DAYS WAS NOT LIMITED TO THE MANUFACTURE OF PHENOMENA FOR THE MARKET PLACE
6088-34571-0029 A SPECIES OF AUGMENTATIVE OF THE COURTIER AND EUNUCHS FOR SULTANS AND POPES IT ABOUNDED IN VARIETIES ONE OF ITS TRIUMPHS WAS THE MANUFACTURE OF COCKS FOR THE KING OF ENGLAND IT WAS THE CUSTOM
6088-34571-0030 IN THE PALACE OF THE KINGS OF ENGLAND TO HAVE A SORT OF WATCHMAN WHO CROWED LIKE A COCK THIS WATCHER AWAKE WHILE ALL OTHERS SLEPT RANGED THE PALACE AND RAISED FROM HOUR TO HOUR THE CRY OF THE FARMYARD
6088-34571-0031 THE SALIVATION INSEPARABLE TO THE OPERATION HAVING DISGUSTED THE DUCHESS OF PORTSMOUTH THE APPOINTMENT WAS INDEED PRESERVED SO THAT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE CROWN SHOULD NOT BE TARNISHED BUT THEY GOT AN UNMUTILATED MAN TO REPRESENT THE COCK
6088-34571-0032 A RETIRED OFFICER WAS GENERALLY SELECTED FOR THIS HONOURABLE EMPLOYMENT
6088-34571-0033 INFORM US THAT AT SAINT PETERSBURG SCARCELY A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE
6088-34571-0034 HE WAS FORCED TO SQUAT DOWN IN THE GREAT ANTECHAMBER OF THE PALACE
6088-34571-0035 OR CLUCKING LIKE A SITTING HEN AND PECKING HIS FOOD FROM THE FLOOR THESE FASHIONS HAVE PASSED AWAY BUT NOT SO MUCH PERHAPS AS ONE MIGHT IMAGINE
6088-34571-0036 NOWADAYS COURTIERS SLIGHTLY MODIFY THEIR INTONATION IN CLUCKING TO PLEASE THEIR MASTERS MORE THAN ONE PICKS UP FROM THE GROUND WE WILL NOT SAY FROM THE MUD
6088-34571-0037 IT IS VERY FORTUNATE THAT KINGS CANNOT ERR
6088-34571-0038 WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO LOUIS THE GREAT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CROWN OF SAINT LOUIS WE KNOW WHAT HIS DISPLEASURE WAS WHEN MADAME HENRIETTE FORGOT HERSELF SO FAR AS TO SEE A HEN IN A DREAM
6088-34571-0039 AND CARRIED ON THE TRADE THEY BOUGHT CHILDREN WORKED A LITTLE ON THE RAW MATERIAL AND RESOLD THEM AFTERWARDS THE VENDERS WERE OF ALL KINDS FROM THE WRETCHED FATHER GETTING RID OF HIS FAMILY TO THE MASTER
6088-34571-0040 AND HUNG UP HIS SUBJECTS IN HIS SHOP COME BUY IT IS FOR SALE IN ENGLAND UNDER JEFFREYS AFTER THE TRAGICAL EPISODE OF MONMOUTH
6088-34571-0041 WIDOWS AND ORPHANS
6088-34571-0042 HIS WIFE THE QUEEN SOLD THESE LADIES TO WILLIAM PENN VERY LIKELY THE KING HAD SO MUCH PER CENT ON THE TRANSACTION THE EXTRAORDINARY THING IS
6088-34571-0043 PENN'S PURCHASE IS EXCUSED OR EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT HAVING A DESERT TO SOW WITH MEN HE NEEDED WOMEN AS FARMING IMPLEMENTS HER GRACIOUS MAJESTY MADE A GOOD BUSINESS OUT OF THESE LADIES
6088-34571-0044 THE YOUNG SOLD DEAR WE MAY IMAGINE WITH THE UNEASY FEELING WHICH A COMPLICATED SCANDAL AROUSES THAT PROBABLY SOME OLD DUCHESSES WERE THROWN IN CHEAP THE COMPRACHICOS WERE ALSO CALLED THE CHEYLAS
6088-34571-0045 A HINDU WORD WHICH CONVEYS THE IMAGE OF HARRYING A NEST FOR A LONG TIME THE COMPRACHICOS ONLY PARTIALLY CONCEALED THEMSELVES
6088-34571-0046 THERE IS SOMETIMES IN THE SOCIAL ORDER A FAVOURING SHADOW THROWN OVER INIQUITOUS TRADES IN WHICH THEY THRIVE IN OUR OWN DAY WE HAVE SEEN AN ASSOCIATION OF THE KIND IN SPAIN
6088-34571-0047 THE COMPRACHICOS WERE BY NO MEANS IN BAD ODOUR AT COURT ON OCCASIONS THEY WERE USED FOR REASONS OF STATE
6088-34571-0048 THEY WERE ALMOST AN INSTRUMENTUM REGNI IT WAS A TIME WHEN FAMILIES WHICH WERE REFRACTORY OR IN THE WAY WERE DISMEMBERED WHEN A DESCENT WAS CUT SHORT WHEN HEIRS WERE SUDDENLY SUPPRESSED
6088-34571-0049 AT TIMES ONE BRANCH WAS DEFRAUDED TO THE PROFIT OF ANOTHER THE COMPRACHICOS HAD A GENIUS FOR DISFIGURATION WHICH RECOMMENDED THEM TO STATE POLICY TO DISFIGURE IS BETTER THAN TO KILL
6088-34571-0050 THERE WAS INDEED THE IRON MASK BUT THAT WAS A MIGHTY MEASURE EUROPE COULD NOT BE PEOPLED WITH IRON MASKS WHILE DEFORMED TUMBLERS RAN ABOUT THE STREETS WITHOUT CREATING ANY SURPRISE BESIDES THE IRON MASK IS REMOVABLE
6088-34571-0051 NOT SO THE MASK OF FLESH YOU ARE MASKED FOR EVER BY YOUR OWN FLESH WHAT CAN BE MORE INGENIOUS THE COMPRACHICOS WORKED ON MAN AS THE CHINESE WORK ON TREES
6088-34571-0052 THEY HAD THEIR SECRETS AS WE HAVE SAID THEY HAD TRICKS WHICH ARE NOW LOST ARTS A SORT OF FANTASTIC STUNTED THING LEFT THEIR HANDS IT WAS RIDICULOUS AND WONDERFUL
6088-34571-0053 THEY WOULD TOUCH UP A LITTLE BEING WITH SUCH SKILL THAT ITS FATHER COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN IT ET QUE MECONNAITRAIT L'OEIL MEME DE SON PERE AS RACINE SAYS IN BAD FRENCH
6088-34571-0054 HAD THEIR JOINTS DISLOCATED IN A MASTERLY MANNER YOU WOULD HAVE SAID THEY HAD BEEN BONED THUS GYMNASTS WERE MADE NOT ONLY DID THE COMPRACHICOS TAKE AWAY HIS FACE FROM THE CHILD
6088-34571-0055 THEY ALSO TOOK AWAY HIS MEMORY AT LEAST THEY TOOK AWAY ALL THEY COULD OF IT THE CHILD HAD NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUTILATION TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED THIS FRIGHTFUL SURGERY LEFT ITS TRACES ON HIS COUNTENANCE
6088-34571-0056 BUT NOT ON HIS MIND THE MOST HE COULD RECALL WAS THAT ONE DAY HE HAD BEEN SEIZED BY MEN THAT NEXT HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP
6088-34571-0057 CURED OF WHAT HE DID NOT KNOW OF BURNINGS BY SULPHUR AND INCISIONS BY THE IRON HE REMEMBERED NOTHING THE COMPRACHICOS DEADENED THE LITTLE PATIENT BY MEANS OF A STUPEFYING POWDER WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO BE MAGICAL
6088-34571-0058 AND SUPPRESSED ALL PAIN THIS POWDER HAS BEEN KNOWN FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL IN CHINA AND IS STILL EMPLOYED THERE IN THE PRESENT DAY THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN BEFOREHAND WITH US IN ALL OUR INVENTIONS PRINTING ARTILLERY
6088-34571-0059 REMAINS A CHRYSALIS IN CHINA
6088-34571-0060 CHINA IS A MUSEUM OF EMBRYOS SINCE WE ARE IN CHINA LET US REMAIN THERE A MOMENT TO NOTE A PECULIARITY IN CHINA FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL
6088-34571-0061 THEY HAVE POSSESSED A CERTAIN REFINEMENT OF INDUSTRY AND ART IT IS THE ART OF MOULDING A LIVING MAN THEY TAKE A CHILD
6088-34571-0062 PUT HIM IN A PORCELAIN VASE MORE OR LESS GROTESQUE WHICH IS MADE WITHOUT TOP OR BOTTOM TO ALLOW EGRESS FOR THE HEAD AND FEET
6088-34571-0063 THUS THE CHILD THICKENS WITHOUT GROWING TALLER FILLING UP WITH HIS COMPRESSED FLESH AND DISTORTED BONES THE RELIEFS IN THE VASE THIS DEVELOPMENT IN A BOTTLE CONTINUES MANY YEARS
6088-34571-0064 THE CHILD COMES OUT AND BEHOLD
6088-34571-0065 THIS IS CONVENIENT BY ORDERING YOUR DWARF BETIMES YOU ARE ABLE TO HAVE IT OF ANY SHAPE YOU WISH
6088-34571-0066 AN EXCELLENT EXPEDIENT SOMETIMES FOR THE HIGHER ONE WHICH IS CALLED STATE POLICY WAS WILLINGLY LEFT IN A MISERABLE STATE BUT WAS NOT PERSECUTED THERE WAS NO SURVEILLANCE BUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ATTENTION
6088-34571-0067 THUS MUCH MIGHT BE USEFUL THE LAW CLOSED ONE EYE THE KING OPENED THE OTHER SOMETIMES THE KING WENT SO FAR AS TO AVOW HIS COMPLICITY THESE ARE AUDACITIES OF MONARCHICAL TERRORISM
6088-34571-0068 THEY TOOK FROM HIM THE MARK OF GOD THEY PUT ON HIM THE MARK OF THE KING JACOB ASTLEY KNIGHT AND BARONET LORD OF MELTON CONSTABLE IN THE COUNTY OF NORFOLK HAD IN HIS FAMILY A CHILD WHO HAD BEEN SOLD
6088-34571-0069 AND UPON WHOSE FOREHEAD THE DEALER HAD IMPRINTED A FLEUR DE LIS WITH A HOT IRON
6088-34571-0070 FOR HER PERSONAL SERVICE THE FLEUR DE LIS THE COMPRACHICOS ALLOWING FOR THE SHADE WHICH DIVIDES A TRADE FROM A FANATICISM WERE ANALOGOUS TO THE STRANGLERS OF INDIA
6088-34571-0071 THEY LIVED AMONG THEMSELVES IN GANGS AND TO FACILITATE THEIR PROGRESS AFFECTED SOMEWHAT OF THE MERRY ANDREW
6088-34571-0072 THE PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME WRONGLY CONFOUNDED THEM WITH THE MOORS OF SPAIN AND THE MOORS OF CHINA THE MOORS OF SPAIN WERE COINERS THE MOORS OF CHINA WERE THIEVES THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT ABOUT THE COMPRACHICOS THEY WERE HONEST FOLK
6088-34571-0073 WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF THEM THEY WERE SOMETIMES SINCERELY SCRUPULOUS THEY PUSHED OPEN A DOOR ENTERED BARGAINED FOR A CHILD PAID AND DEPARTED ALL WAS DONE WITH PROPRIETY THEY WERE OF ALL COUNTRIES
6088-34571-0074 UNDER THE NAME OF COMPRACHICOS FRATERNIZED ENGLISH FRENCH CASTILIANS GERMANS ITALIANS A UNITY OF IDEA A UNITY OF SUPERSTITION THE PURSUIT OF THE SAME CALLING
6088-34571-0075 MAKE SUCH FUSIONS IN THIS FRATERNITY OF VAGABONDS THOSE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEABOARD REPRESENTED THE EAST THOSE OF THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD THE WEST MANY BASQUES CONVERSED WITH MANY IRISHMEN
6088-34571-0076 THEY SPEAK THE OLD PUNIC JARGON ADD TO THIS THE INTIMATE RELATIONS OF CATHOLIC IRELAND WITH CATHOLIC SPAIN RELATIONS SUCH THAT THEY TERMINATED BY BRINGING TO THE GALLOWS IN LONDON ONE ALMOST KING OF IRELAND THE CELTIC LORD DE BRANY
