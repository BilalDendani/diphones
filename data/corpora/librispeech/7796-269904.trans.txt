7796-269904-0000 GO IN TO PHARAOH AND SAY TO HIM JEHOVAH COMMANDS LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY WORSHIP ME IF YOU REFUSE TO LET THEM GO THEN I WILL AFFLICT ALL YOUR LAND WITH FROGS AND THE NILE SHALL SWARM WITH FROGS
7796-269904-0001 WHICH SHALL GO UP AND COME INTO YOUR HOUSE INTO YOUR SLEEPING CHAMBER UPON YOUR BED INTO THE HOUSES OF YOUR SERVANTS UPON YOUR PEOPLE AND INTO YOUR OVENS AND KNEADING TROUGHS
7796-269904-0002 AND ALL YOUR SERVANTS THEN JEHOVAH SAID TO MOSES SAY TO AARON STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND WITH YOUR STAFF OVER THE RIVERS OVER THE CANALS AND OVER THE POOLS AND CAUSE FROGS TO COME UP OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT
7796-269904-0003 WILL YOU DO YOURSELF THE HONOR OF TELLING ME AT WHAT TIME I SHALL PRAY TO JEHOVAH IN YOUR BEHALF AND IN BEHALF OF YOUR SERVANTS AND PEOPLE THAT THE FROGS BE DESTROYED FROM YOUR PALACES AND BE LEFT ONLY IN THE NILE PHARAOH ANSWERED TO MORROW
7796-269904-0004 THEN MOSES SAID LET IT BE AS YOU SAY THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE JEHOVAH OUR GOD THE FROGS SHALL DEPART FROM YOU FROM YOUR PALACES AND FROM YOUR SERVANTS AND PEOPLE THEY SHALL BE LEFT ONLY IN THE NILE
7796-269904-0005 WHEN MOSES AND AARON HAD GONE OUT FROM PHARAOH MOSES PRAYED TO JEHOVAH TO REMOVE THE FROGS WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT UPON PHARAOH AND JEHOVAH DID AS MOSES ASKED THE FROGS DIED IN THE HOUSES IN THE COURTS AND IN THE FIELDS
7796-269904-0006 THEN JEHOVAH SAID TO MOSES GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND STAND BEFORE PHARAOH JUST AS HE GOES OUT TO THE WATER AND SAY TO HIM JEHOVAH COMMANDS LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY WORSHIP ME IF YOU WILL NOT LET MY PEOPLE GO
7796-269904-0007 I WILL SEND SWARMS OF FLIES UPON YOU UPON YOUR SERVANTS AND UPON YOUR PEOPLE AND INTO YOUR PALACES SO THAT THE HOUSES OF THE EGYPTIANS SHALL BE FULL OF SWARMS OF FLIES AS WELL AS THE GROUND UPON WHICH THEY STAND
7796-269904-0008 BUT AT THAT TIME I WILL SET APART THE LAND OF GOSHEN IN WHICH MY PEOPLE LIVE AND NO SWARMS OF FLIES SHALL BE THERE SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT I JEHOVAH AM IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH AND JEHOVAH DID SO
7796-269904-0009 A VAST SWARM OF FLIES CAME UPON PHARAOH'S PALACE AND INTO THE HOMES OF HIS SERVANTS AND ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT WAS RUINED BY THE SWARMS OF FLIES
7796-269904-0010 I WILL LET YOU GO THAT YOU MAY OFFER A SACRIFICE TO JEHOVAH YOUR GOD IN THE WILDERNESS ONLY YOU MUST NOT GO FAR AWAY PRAY FOR ME MOSES REPLIED I WILL GO OUT AND WILL PRAY TO JEHOVAH THAT THE SWARMS OF FLIES MAY DEPART FROM PHARAOH FROM HIS SERVANTS
7796-269904-0011 AND FROM HIS PEOPLE TO MORROW ONLY LET NOT PHARAOH AGAIN ACT DECEITFULLY BY REFUSING TO LET THE PEOPLE GO TO OFFER A SACRIFICE TO JEHOVAH SO MOSES WENT OUT FROM PHARAOH AND PRAYED TO JEHOVAH AND JEHOVAH DID AS MOSES ASKED
7796-269904-0012 BUT THIS TIME ALSO PHARAOH WAS STUBBORN AND WOULD NOT LET THE PEOPLE GO THEN JEHOVAH SAID TO MOSES GO TO PHARAOH AND TELL HIM JEHOVAH THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS COMMANDS LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY WORSHIP ME
7796-269904-0013 AND THE CATTLE OF EGYPT AND NOT ONE THAT BELONGS TO THE ISRAELITES SHALL DIE SO JEHOVAH SET A FIXED TIME SAYING TO MORROW JEHOVAH WILL DO THIS IN THE LAND JEHOVAH DID THIS ON THE NEXT DAY
7796-269904-0014 AND ALL THE CATTLE OF THE EGYPTIANS DIED BUT NONE OF THE CATTLE OF THE ISRAELITES THEN PHARAOH SENT AND FOUND THAT NOT EVEN ONE OF THE CATTLE OF THE ISRAELITES WAS DEAD BUT PHARAOH WAS STUBBORN AND WOULD NOT LET THE PEOPLE GO
7796-269904-0015 DO YOU STILL SET YOURSELF AGAINST MY PEOPLE SO THAT YOU WILL NOT LET THEM GO TO MORROW ABOUT THIS TIME I WILL SEND DOWN A VERY HEAVY FALL OF HAIL SUCH AS HAS NOT BEEN IN EGYPT FROM THE DAY THAT IT BECAME A NATION UNTIL NOW
7796-269904-0016 SO JEHOVAH SENT DOWN HAIL UPON THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE LIGHTNING FLASHING IN THE MIDST OF THE HAIL WAS VERY SEVERE SUCH AS HAD NOT BEEN BEFORE IN ALL EGYPT SINCE IT BECAME A NATION THROUGH THE WHOLE LAND OF EGYPT
7796-269904-0017 THE HAIL STRUCK DOWN EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE FIELD BOTH MAN AND BEAST THE HAIL ALSO STRUCK DOWN ALL THE GROWING PLANTS AND BROKE ALL THE TREES IN THE FIELDS ONLY IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN WHERE THE ISRAELITES WERE THERE WAS NO HAIL
7796-269904-0018 AGAIN PHARAOH SENT AND CALLED FOR MOSES AND AARON AND SAID TO THEM I HAVE SINNED THIS TIME JEHOVAH IS RIGHT AND I AND MY PEOPLE ARE WRONG PRAY TO JEHOVAH FOR THERE HAS BEEN ENOUGH OF THESE MIGHTY THUNDERINGS AND HAIL
7796-269904-0019 AS SOON AS I HAVE GONE OUT OF THE CITY I WILL SPREAD OUT MY HANDS IN PRAYER TO JEHOVAH THE THUNDERS SHALL STOP AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE HAIL THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE EARTH IS JEHOVAH'S
7796-269904-0020 I KNOW THAT EVEN THEN YOU WILL NOT FEAR JEHOVAH SO MOSES WENT OUT OF THE CITY FROM PHARAOH AND SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS TO JEHOVAH AND THE THUNDERS AND HAIL STOPPED
7796-269904-0021 HOW LONG WILL YOU REFUSE TO OBEY ME LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY WORSHIP ME FOR IF YOU REFUSE TO LET MY PEOPLE GO
7796-269904-0022 AND THEY WILL COVER THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH SO THAT NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE GROUND AND THEY SHALL EAT THE REST OF THAT WHICH IS LEFT TO YOU FROM THE HAIL AND THEY SHALL EAT ALL YOUR TREES WHICH GROW IN THE FIELD
7796-269904-0023 THEN MOSES AND AARON WERE DRIVEN OUT FROM PHARAOH'S PRESENCE BUT MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS STAFF OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT AND JEHOVAH CAUSED AN EAST WIND TO BLOW OVER THE LAND ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT
7796-269904-0024 FOR THEY COVERED THE SURFACE OF THE WHOLE LAND SO THAT THE LAND WAS DARKENED AND NOTHING GREEN WAS LEFT NEITHER TREE NOR GROWING PLANTS ANYWHERE IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT THEN PHARAOH CALLED FOR MOSES IN HASTE AND SAID
7796-269904-0025 AND JEHOVAH MADE A VERY STRONG WEST WIND TO BLOW WHICH TOOK UP THE LOCUSTS AND DROVE THEM INTO THE RED SEA NOT A SINGLE LOCUST WAS LEFT IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT
7796-269904-0026 BUT JEHOVAH LET PHARAOH'S HEART REMAIN STUBBORN SO THAT HE WOULD NOT LET THE ISRAELITES GO THEN JEHOVAH SAID TO MOSES STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND TOWARD HEAVEN THAT THERE MAY BE DARKNESS OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT SO DARK
7796-269904-0027 THAT IT MAY BE FELT SO MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TOWARD HEAVEN AND THERE WAS COMPLETE DARKNESS IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT FOR THREE DAYS NO ONE COULD SEE ANOTHER NOR DID ANY ONE MOVE ABOUT FOR THREE DAYS
7796-269904-0028 THEN PHARAOH CALLED MOSES AND SAID GO WORSHIP JEHOVAH ONLY LET YOUR FLOCKS AND YOUR HERDS STAY BEHIND LET YOUR LITTLE ONES GO WITH YOU BUT MOSES SAID
7796-269904-0029 YOU MUST ALSO GIVE US ANIMALS FOR SACRIFICES AND BURNT OFFERINGS THAT WE MAY OFFER A SACRIFICE TO JEHOVAH OUR GOD OUR CATTLE TOO MUST GO WITH US NOT A HOOF SHALL BE LEFT BEHIND FOR WE MUST TAKE THESE TO OFFER TO JEHOVAH OUR GOD
7796-269904-0030 AND WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE MUST OFFER TO JEHOVAH UNTIL WE ARRIVE THERE BUT JEHOVAH LET PHARAOH'S HEART REMAIN STUBBORN AND HE WOULD NOT LET THEM GO AND PHARAOH SAID TO HIM GO AWAY FROM ME TAKE CARE THAT YOU NEVER COME TO ME AGAIN
7796-269904-0031 ALL THE ELDEST SONS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT SHALL DIE
7796-269904-0032 EVEN TO THE ELDEST SON OF THE SLAVE GIRL WHO IS BEHIND THE MILL AND ALL THE FIRST BORN OF THE CATTLE
7796-269904-0033 BUT NOT A SINGLE DOG SHALL BARK AT ANY OF THE ISRAELITES NOR THEIR ANIMALS THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT JEHOVAH DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EGYPTIANS AND ISRAELITES ALL THESE YOUR SERVANTS SHALL COME TO ME
7796-269904-0034 AND BOW DOWN BEFORE ME SAYING GO AWAY TOGETHER WITH ALL THE PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW YOU AFTER THAT I WILL GO AWAY
