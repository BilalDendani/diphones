5840-54188-0000 WITH PADEREWSKI A MODERN PIANIST ON TOUR LISZT NEVER WAS IN THIS COUNTRY BUT WE CAN GAIN SOME IDEA OF THE SUCCESS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS
5840-54188-0001 FROM THE TRIUMPHS OF IGNACE PADEREWSKI OTHER FAMOUS PIANISTS HAVE COME TO THIS COUNTRY THALBERG IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX RUBINSTEIN IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
5840-54188-0002 WHO TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE HERE ROSENTHAL JOSEF HOFMANN BUT PADEREWSKI'S SUCCESS HAS BEEN GREATER THAN ANY OF THESE AMERICANS ARE SAID TO BE FICKLE
5840-54188-0003 BUT ALTHOUGH PADEREWSKI NO LONGER IS A NOVELTY HIS NAME STILL IS THE ONE WITH WHICH TO FILL A CONCERT HALL FROM FLOOR TO ROOF WHY THIS IS SO IS NO SECRET
5840-54188-0004 HEAR HIM AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE REASON TO A TECHNIQUE WHICH DOES NOT HESITATE AT ANYTHING AND AN INDUSTRY THAT FLINCHES AT NOTHING NO ONE PRACTICES MORE ASSIDUOUSLY THAN HE
5840-54188-0005 HE ADDS THE SOUL OF A POET AND THE STRENGTH OF AN ATHLETE
5840-54188-0006 BUT IF YOU WATCH HIM FROM NEAR BY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO NOTE THE GREAT PHYSICAL POWER WHICH HE CAN BRING INTO PLAY WHEN NECESSARY AND WHICH HE NEVER BRINGS INTO PLAY UNLESS IT IS NECESSARY
5840-54188-0007 THEREFORE HE COMBINES POETRY WITH FORCE AND BACK OF BOTH IS THOUGHT INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY IN A FRAME ON THE WALL OF A NEW YORK TRUST COMPANY IS A CHECK
5840-54188-0008 IT REPRESENTS THE NET RECEIPTS OF ONE VIRTUOSO FOR ONE CONCERT TOUR AND IS BELIEVED TO BE THE LARGEST ACTUAL AMOUNT EVER EARNED IN THIS COUNTRY BY AN ARTIST WHETHER SINGER OR PLAYER IN A SINGLE SEASON
5840-54188-0009 THIS CHECK IS DRAWN TO THE ORDER OF IGNACE J PADEREWSKI AN OPINION REGARDING THE PIANO BY A MAN WHO BY PLAYING IT CAN EARN SO LARGE A SUM
5840-54188-0010 AND EARN IT BECAUSE HE IS THE GREATEST LIVING EXPONENT OF PIANOFORTE PLAYING WOULD SEEM WORTH HAVING PADEREWSKI BELIEVES THAT SAVE IN ONE RESPECT THE PIANOFORTE HAS REACHED PERFECTION
5840-54188-0011 AND IS INCAPABLE OF FURTHER IMPROVEMENT HE DOES NOT THINK THAT ANYTHING MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO ADD TO ITS VOLUME OF TONE IF ANYTHING HE CONSIDERS THIS TOO GREAT AND THE INSTRUMENT TOO LOUD ALREADY
5840-54188-0012 INSTEAD OF MORE POWER RATHER LESS WOULD BE SATISFACTORY WHEREIN HOWEVER HE CONSIDERS THE INSTRUMENT STILL LACKING NOTWITHSTANDING ITS WONDERFUL DEVELOPMENT DURING THE LAST CENTURY
5840-54188-0013 IS IN ITS CAPACITY FOR SUSTAINED TONE FOR HOLDING A LONG DRAWN OUT TONE WITH THE FACILITY OF THE VIOLIN FOR EXAMPLE HE IS CONVINCED HOWEVER
5840-54188-0014 THAT THE MEANS OF IMPARTING THIS CAPACITY FOR SUSTAINING TONE TO THE PIANOFORTE WILL BE DISCOVERED IN DUE TIME AND THAT THE INVENTION PROBABLY WILL BE MADE IN THIS COUNTRY
5840-54188-0015 THAT INCREASED TONE SUSTAINING POWER FOR THE INSTRUMENT IS A GREAT DESIDERATUM DOUBTLESS IS THE OPINION OF MANY EXPERTS BUT THAT THE GREATEST MASTER OF THE PIANOFORTE CONSIDERS IT PERFECT IN OTHER RESPECTS
5840-54188-0016 IS HIGHLY INTERESTING AND SIGNIFICANT
5840-54188-0017 BECAUSE WITHIN THE SMALLEST COMPASS AND WITH THE SIMPLEST MEANS OF CONTROL IT HAS THE RANGE OF AN ORCHESTRA FOR THIS REASON IT IS THE MOST POPULAR OF INSTRUMENTS AND IN ITS MANUFACTURE
5840-54188-0018 EXTENDS FROM THE POLISHED DRY GOODS BOX WITH INTERNAL ORGANS OF IRON WIRE AND FELT AND WITH A GLISTENING ROW OF CELLULOID TEETH READY TO BITE AS SOON AS EVER THE LID IS RAISED TO THE HIGHEST CLASS CONCERT GRAND
5840-54188-0019 THE PIANO DOCTOR WE WHO HAVE OUR PIANOFORTES IN OUR OWN HOMES AND ARE CONTENT WITH AN OCCASIONAL VISIT FROM THE TUNER LITTLE DREAM OF THE CARE BESTOWED UPON THE INSTRUMENT
5840-54188-0020 ON WHICH AN ARTIST LIKE PADEREWSKI PLAYS INSTRUMENT I SHOULD HAVE SAID INSTRUMENTS FOR WHEN HE IS ON TOUR HE HAS A WHOLE SUITE OF THEM NO LESS THAN FOUR AND EACH IS CODDLED AS IF IT WERE A PRIMA DONNA
5840-54188-0021 METAL AND IVORY TRUE THESE PIANOS DO NOT HAVE THEIR THROATS SPRAYED ON THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE OCCASION BUT THEY ARE CAREFULLY PROTECTED AGAINST EXTREMES OF HEAT AND COLD AND WHILE THE PRIMA DONNA CONSULTS HER PHYSICIAN ONLY AT INTERVALS A PIANO DOCTOR
5840-54188-0022 IS IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE ON THESE INSTRUMENTS PADEREWSKI'S PIANO DOCTOR HAS TRAVELED WITH HIM FOR SEVERAL SEASONS OCCUPYING THE SAME PRIVATE CAR AND PRACTICALLY LIVING WITH HIM DURING THE ENTIRE TOUR
5840-54188-0023 HE WAS WITH HIM ON THE TOUR IN FACT AT HIS TABLE AT BREAKFAST WITH HIM WHEN HIS SPECIAL TRAIN WAS RUN ON TO AN OPEN SIDING NEAR EAST SYRACUSE AND LEFT THE TRACK
5840-54188-0024 PADEREWSKI BEING THROWN FORWARD ON HIS HANDS AGAINST THE TABLE AND STRAINING THE MUSCLES OF ONE ARM SO SEVERELY THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO CANCEL HIS REMAINING ENGAGEMENTS UP TO THAT TIME HOWEVER HIS NET RECEIPTS
5840-54188-0025 FROM SEVENTY FOUR CONCERTS
5840-54188-0026 WHILE BEFORE THIS AMERICAN TOUR BEGAN HE GAVE THIRTY SIX CONCERTS IN AUSTRALIA WITH AVERAGE RECEIPTS OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS HIS RECORD CONCERT WAS AT DALLAS TEXAS SOME YEARS AGO
5840-54188-0027 WHEN THE RECEIPTS WERE NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IT OCCURRED DURING A CONFEDERATE REUNION WHILE HE WAS AT THE PIANOFORTE THE VARIOUS POSTS MARCHED UP TO THE HALL WITH BANDS AND FIFE AND DRUM CORPS PLAYING
5840-54188-0028 PADEREWSKI HOWEVER KEPT RIGHT ON THROUGH THE BLASTS AND SHRILLING BUT WHEN ONE OF THE POSTS LET OUT THE FAMOUS REBEL YELL THE PIANIST LEAPED FROM HIS SEAT AS IF HE EXPECTED A TIGER TO SPRING AT HIS THROAT
5840-54188-0029 THEN HE REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED SMILED AND CONTINUED AMID LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE HE HAD HEARD OF THE FAMOUS REBEL YELL BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD HEARD IT PIANOFORTES ON THEIR TRAVELS
5840-54188-0030 BUT TO RETURN TO THE PIANOFORTES ON TOUR WHEN PADEREWSKI CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM AUSTRALIA HIS PIANO DOCTOR MET HIM AT SAN FRANCISCO WITH FOUR INSTRUMENTS
5840-54188-0031 WHICH HAD BEEN SELECTED WITH GREAT CARE IN NEW YORK AND BEEN SHIPPED WEST IN CHARGE OF THE DOCTOR ONE OF THESE THE VIRTUOSO RESERVED FOR HIS PRIVATE CAR
5840-54188-0032 WHENEVER THERE IS A STOP LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE HE RARELY PLAYS WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION OF THE OTHER THREE INSTRUMENTS THE TWO HE LIKED BEST WERE SENT TO HIS HOTEL
5840-54188-0033 WHERE DURING FOUR DAYS PRECEDING HIS FIRST CONCERT HE PRACTICED FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT HOURS A DAY NOTIFYING THE DOCTOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN ADVANCE
5840-54188-0034 THE OTHERS NO TWO
5840-54188-0035 THE PIANIST'S ROUTE TOOK HIM FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO OAKLAND SAN JOSE AND PORTLAND OREGON TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT HE ALWAYS WILL HAVE A FINE INSTRUMENT TO PLAY ON
5840-54188-0036 A METHOD OF SHIPPING AHEAD THE INSTRUMENTS NOT IN USE IS ADOPTED THUS
5840-54188-0037 OF COURSE NONE BUT AN EXPERT COULD DETECT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE IN THESE PIANOFORTES BUT A PLAYER LIKE PADEREWSKI
5840-54188-0038 ONE OF HIS IDIOSYNCRASIES IS THAT ALWAYS BEFORE GOING ON HE ASKS THE DOCTOR WHICH OF THE THREE INSTRUMENTS IS ON THE STAGE BECAUSE AS HE HIMSELF EXPRESSES IT I DON'T WANT TO MEET A STRANGER
5840-54188-0039 AFTER EACH CONCERT AT SUPPER THIS CONVERSATION INVARIABLY TAKES PLACE PADEREWSKI WELL DOCTOR IT SOUNDED ALL RIGHT TO NIGHT DIDN'T IT
5840-54188-0040 DOCTOR YES SIR PADEREWSKI WELL THEN PLEASE PASS ME THE BREAD THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OCCASION TO RECORD WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DOCTOR
5840-54188-0041 WERE TO SAY NO SIR FOR HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE WITH THE MOST SCRUPULOUS REGARD FOR VERACITY
5840-54188-0042 PADEREWSKI IS AS CAREFUL TO PLAY HIS BEST IN THE LEAST IMPORTANT PLACE IN WHICH HE GIVES A CONCERT AS HE IS IN NEW YORK THIS HIGH SENSE OF DUTY TOWARD HIS PUBLIC
5840-54188-0043 ACCOUNTS IN PART FOR HIS SUPREMACY AMONG PIANISTS PADEREWSKI IS NOT A MERE VIRTUOSO HE IS A MAN OF FINE INTELLECTUAL GIFTS WHO PLAYS THE PIANO LIKE A POET
5840-54188-0044 PAUL POTTER THE PLAYWRIGHT WHO LIVES IN GENEVA SWITZERLAND AND OCCASIONALLY HAS DINED THERE WITH PADEREWSKI TELLS ME THAT HE HAS CONVERSED WITH THE PIANIST ON ALMOST EVERY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT EXCEPT MUSIC
5840-54188-0045 AND ALWAYS FOUND HIM REMARKABLY WELL INFORMED HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE HISTORY OF HIS NATIVE LAND POLAND AND OF ITS LITERATURE IS SAID TO BE QUITE WONDERFUL CHOPIN ALSO A POLE
5840-54188-0046 HE IDOLIZES AND REGARDS AS FAR AND AWAY THE GREATEST COMPOSER FOR THE PIANO TO THE FUND FOR THE CHOPIN MEMORIAL AT WARSAW HE CONTRIBUTES BY CHARGING ONE DOLLAR FOR HIS AUTOGRAPH
5840-54188-0047 AND TWO DOLLARS FOR HIS SIGNATURE AND A FEW BARS OF MUSIC FROM THE MONEY RECEIVED AS THE PROCEEDS OF ONE SEASON'S AUTOGRAPHS HE WAS ABLE TO REMIT ABOUT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THE FUND
5840-54188-0048 THE PIANOFORTE WHICH THE VIRTUOSO HAS USED AT HIS CONCERT ALREADY WILL BE ON THE WAY TO ITS NEXT DESTINATION FOR IT IS PART OF THE DOCTOR'S DUTY
5840-54188-0049 THE LEGS ARE REMOVED AND THEN A CAREFULLY FITTED CANVAS IS DRAWN OVER THE BODY AND HELD IN PLACE BY STRAPS THE BODY IS SLID OUT OF THE HALL AND SLOWLY LET DOWN ONTO A SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED EIGHT WHEEL SKID
5840-54188-0050 SWUNG LOW SO AS TO BE AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE ON A LEVEL WITH THE PLATFORM THIS SKID IS PART OF THE OUTFIT OF THE TOUR THE RECORD TIME FOR DETACHING THE LEGS OF THE PIANOFORTE
5840-54188-0051 COVERING THE BODY REMOVING THE INSTRUMENT FROM THE STAGE AND HAVING IT ON THE SKID READY TO START FOR THE STATION IS SEVEN MINUTES THAWING OUT A PIANOFORTE
5840-54188-0052 THE INSTRUMENTS NEVER ARE SET UP EXCEPT UNDER THE DOCTOR'S PERSONAL SUPERVISION BEFORE EACH CONCERT THE PIANOFORTE ON WHICH PADEREWSKI IS TO PLAY IS CAREFULLY GONE OVER
5840-54188-0053 AND PUT IN PERFECT CONDITION TUNED AND IF NECESSARY REGULATED AND THIS NO MATTER HOW RECENTLY HE MAY HAVE USED IT
5840-54188-0054 DEFECTS SO TRIFLING THAT NEITHER AN ORDINARY PLAYER NOR THE PUBLIC WOULD NOTICE THEM WOULD JAR ON THE SENSITIVE EAR AND NERVES OF THE VIRTUOSO SOMETIMES THE INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO SUCH A LOW TEMPERATURE
5840-54188-0055 BUT EVEN ON THE IRON PLATE INSIDE IN SUCH CASES THE PIANOFORTE IS SET UP AND AFTER THE FILM OF FROST HAS BEEN SCRAPED OFF IS ALLOWED TO THAW OUT SLOWLY AND NATURALLY
5840-54188-0056 BEFORE IT IS TOUCHED FOR TUNING OR REGULATING THERE WAS AN AMUSING INCIDENT IN THE HANDLING OF ONE OF THE PADEREWSKI INSTRUMENTS AT COLUMBUS MISSISSIPPI WHERE PADEREWSKI PLAYED FOR SEVEN HUNDRED GIRLS AT THE STATE COLLEGE
5840-54188-0057 ALTHOUGH IT WAS MORE EXCITING THAN DIVERTING AT THE TIME IT HAPPENED THE DOCTOR RELIES ON LOCAL HELP FOR GETTING THE PIANOFORTE FROM THE SKID TO THE STAGE AND BACK AGAIN
5840-54188-0058 USUALLY EFFICIENT HELPERS ARE OBTAINABLE BUT AT COLUMBUS WHERE THE COLLEGE HALL IS UPSTAIRS AND REACHED ONLY BY A NARROW FLIGHT OF STEPS THERE WAS NO AID TO BE HAD SAVE FROM AMONG THE NEGROES LOUNGING ON THE PUBLIC SQUARE
5840-54188-0059 THE DOCTOR WENT AMONG THEM WHAT ARE YOU DOING HE ASKED NAWTHIN WANT A JOB NAW TOO BUSY WAS THE USUAL REPLY
5840-54188-0060 AT LAST HOWEVER A BAND OF TWENTY COLORED GENTLEMEN WAS SECURED IN THE HOPE THAT MUSCLE AND QUANTITY WOULD MAKE UP FOR LACK OF QUALITY BUT NEVER BEFORE HAS A HIGH GRADE PIANOFORTE
5840-54188-0061 BEEN IN SUCH IMMINENT PERIL IT WAS GOT UPSTAIRS WELL ENOUGH IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE NEGROES WALKED ALL OVER EACH OTHER BUT THE DESCENT THE DOCTOR EMIL C FISCHER STOOD AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS DIRECTING
5840-54188-0062 BELOW AROUND THE LATTER FELL A SHOWER OF FRAGMENTS FROM THE WALL THE RAIL THE POSTS AND AT ONE TIME IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE BANISTER WOULD GIVE WAY AND THE PIANOFORTE CRASH IN SPLINTERS ON THE FLOOR
5840-54188-0063 THERE WERE OTHER MOMENTS OF SUSPENSE FOR THE PIANOFORTE AS WELL AS FOR THE TWO WATCHERS WHO DREW A LONG BREATH WHEN THE INSTRUMENT SAFELY WAS ON THE SKID
5840-54188-0064 FORTUNATELY SUCH UNTOWARD INCIDENTS ARE FORGOTTEN IN THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE OF GOOD HUMOR WHICH THE PIANIST DIFFUSES ABOUT HIM HE ENJOYS HIS LITTLE JOKE
5840-54188-0065 DURING THE LAST TOUR HE HANDED A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIMSELF TO MISTER FRANCKE INSCRIBED TO THE FUTURE GOVERNOR OF HOBOKEN AT THE AUDITORIUM HOTEL CHICAGO
5840-54188-0066 MILLWARD ADAMS BROTHER ABOUT LEAVING ON A TRIP ASKED FOR AN AUTOGRAPH PADEREWSKI QUICK AS A FLASH WROTE FOR THE BROTHER OF MISTER ADAMS ON THE EVE
5840-54188-0067 OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM CHICAGO PADEREWSKI TRAVELS ON A SPECIAL TRAIN WITH HIM USUALLY ARE HIS WIFE HIS MANAGER THE TREASURER OF THE TOUR THE PIANO DOCTOR
5840-54188-0068 A SECRETARY VALET AND MAID HIS HOME IS A VILLA ON LAKE GENEVA WHERE HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN AND VINERY HIS DOGS HIS ROOM FOR BILLIARDS A GAME OF WHICH HE IS VERY FOND
5840-54188-0069 AND UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITY FOR SWIMMING HIS FAVORITE EXERCISE APPARENTLY SLENDER AND SURELY MOST POET LOOKING AT THE PIANO
