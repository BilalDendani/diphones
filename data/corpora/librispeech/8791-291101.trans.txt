8791-291101-0048 PLOVER SWUNG UP BEFORE HIM WITH MELANCHOLY CRIES A SOFT HAZE ROSE FROM THE PLAINS THEY GREW MORE VAST MORE ENDLESS
8791-291101-0049 IN THE NORTH A WHITE CLOUD MASS PILED ITSELF UP AND UP UNTIL IT SEEMED AS IF IT MIGHT TOPPLE OVER UPON THE FLAT WORLD BENEATH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE LOOKED AT THE COUNTRY EXCEPT AS REAL ESTATE NEVER SEEN THE PLAINS
8791-291101-0050 AND A CURIOUS NEW SENSE OF THE BIGNESS OF THE EARTH OPPRESSED HIM HE FELT VERY SMALL AND VERY MEAN THE HUMILIATION OF HIS SPIRITS WAS A NOVEL FEELING AND AN UNPLEASANT ONE HE TRIED TO HUM IT AWAY

8791-291101-0053 HE COULD NOT COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS FOR BUSINESS A CURIOUS SENSE OF WEAKENED IDENTITY PERPLEXED HIM AND HIS HEAD WAS FULL OF DRIFTING PICTURES WALDRON'S FACE AMONG THEM THAT FACE LINGERED HE SAW HIM LOOKING VAGUELY OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW
8791-291101-0054 SAYING THAT HE COULDN'T STAND UP UNDER IT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE WONDERED IF IT WAS A BLUFF AFTER ALL THE FACE FADED AWAY LEAVING A DULL PITY BEHIND IT A STRUGGLING REMORSE
8791-291101-0055 CARGAN SHIFTED UNEASILY IN HIS SADDLE AND TRIED TO THINK OF BUSINESS BUT INSTEAD OF BUSINESS QUEER CHILDISH IDEAS BEGAN FLOATING IN AND OUT OF HIS MIND ACCOMPANIED BY WORDS REMEMBERED FROM SUNDAYS IN HIS BOYHOOD HE WAS ALONE WITH GOD
8791-291101-0056 GOD SAW INTO HIS HEART A LITTLE NERVOUS SHIVER RAN OVER HIM AND WHEN HE CHECKED IT WITH A LAUGH THERE FOLLOWED A WAVE OF SUPERSTITIOUS EMOTION
8791-291101-0057 A LOW WAVE OF THE PRAIRIES HAD HIDDEN FROM HIM A LITTLE HOUSE AND BARN STANDING CRUDELY NEW AGAINST THE SKY IN THE DISTANCE TINY FIGURES WERE MOVING BEHIND THE BUILDINGS AND A DUST CLOUD ROSE FROM THE HIGHWAY IN FRONT
8791-291101-0058 CARGAN SUDDENLY BECAME CONSCIOUS OF HIS APPEARANCE HIS SERGE SUIT HIS STRAW HAT HIS AWKWARD SEAT IN THE SADDLE THE LONELINESS OF THE PLAINS HAD SHAKEN HIS USUAL SELF ASSURANCE MAYBE THEY'LL THINK I STOLE THIS HORSE GUESS I'LL GO ROUND
8791-291101-0059 HE SAID ALOUD HE JERKED HIS STEED FROM THE ROAD INTO THE GRASS AND URGED HIM INTO A TROT INSTANTLY HE FOUND HIMSELF BEATEN AND JOLTED LIKE A SHIP IN A TEMPEST HE LOST A STIRRUP HE SLIPPED SIDEWISE ON THE SADDLE
8791-291101-0060 THEN IN A PANICKY FRIGHT HE BEGAN TO SHOUT AND SAW AT THE BIT FRIGHTENED BY THE VOICE AND THE THUNDER OF HOOFS A CHAPARRAL COCK DARTED FROM BENEATH THE HORSE'S NOSE IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BEAST SWERVE THEN TOSS HIS HEAD
8791-291101-0061 AND IN A PANIC MADDER THAN HIS RIDER'S BREAK INTO A RUN AND DASH UNRESTRAINABLY ONWARD CARGAN NUMB WITH FRIGHT LEANED OVER HIS NECK AND WOUND HIS HANDS IN THE MANE THE SPEED SICKENED HIM THE FLAT EARTH SWUNG BENEATH
8791-291101-0062 THE SKY SWAM DIZZILY HE DARED NOT PULL ON THE REINS HE COULD ONLY HOLD ON GRIMLY AND SHUT HIS EYES ONCE HE SLIPPED AND SCREAMING SAW FOR AN INSTANT A BLUR OF GRASS BEFORE HE COULD PULL HIMSELF BACK TO SAFETY
8791-291101-0063 AND THEN THE SPEED INCREASED THE SWEATY SHOULDERS LABORED BENEATH HIM AND HIS SENSES WHIRLED HE DID NOT NOTE HOW FAR THEY RAN BUT AT LAST CAME A SLOWER MOTION A GALLOP AND THEN A TROT
8791-291101-0064 WEAK FROM EXHAUSTION HE WAS BUMPED FROM THE SADDLE AND FOUND HIMSELF CLUTCHING AND KICKING WITH BOTH ARMS AROUND HIS HORSE'S NECK FLINGING HIMSELF OUTWARD HE ROLLED OVER ON THE SOFT GROUND AND LAY GROANING ON THE PRAIRIE
8791-291101-0065 THE WELL TRAINED HORSE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GRAZE HE TOO WAS QUIVERING WITH FATIGUE BUT HIS FRIGHT WAS OVER THE SUN WAS BURNING NEAR THE ZENITH THE WORLD AGAIN WAS EMPTY AND THIS TIME THERE WAS NO ROAD CARGAN WAS LOST
8791-291101-0066 WHEN HE RECOVERED A LITTLE HE CAUGHT THE HORSE AND TOO SHAKEN TO MOUNT HIM LIMPED ON LEADING HIM BY THE BRIDLE IN WHAT DIRECTION HE DID NOT KNOW PANGS OF HUNGER AND FAINTNESS ASSAILED HIM
8791-291101-0067 THE AWFUL LONELINESS CHILLED HIM THROUGH IN SPITE OF THE BLAZE OF HEAT AND LIGHT HE REMEMBERED STORIES OF MEN WHO HAD WANDERED ON THE PRAIRIE ROUND AND ROUND IN AN ENDLESS CIRCLE UNTIL THEY HAD GONE CRAZY AND BLOWN OUT THEIR BRAINS
8791-291101-0068 A PROFOUND PITY FOR HIMSELF STIRRED HIM NEVER HAD HE SO FELT THE NEED OF HUMANITY OF HUMAN AID HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BE WALKING UP MAIN STREET WITH THE BOYS CALLING TO HIM FROM ROONEY'S CIGAR STORE
8791-291101-0069 JUST IN FRONT A LITTLE CALF STUMBLED TO ITS FEET AND RAN TOWARD THEM MOOING PITEOUSLY IT TOO WAS LOST CARGAN STROKED ITS NOSTRILS AND A SYMPATHY FOR ALL SUFFERING THINGS FLOWED THROUGH HIS HEART
8791-291101-0070 HE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER OF WALDRON PACING SOMEWHERE LIKE HIMSELF ALONE LOST HELPLESS HIS PRIDE GONE IN HIS AWAKENED IMAGINATION HE SAW HIM WANDERING NEARER AND NEARER THE FATAL ACT

8791-291101-0072 HIS HORSE PRICKED UP HIS EARS AND THE CALF AMBLED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND CARGAN LIMPED AFTER HURRIEDLY LEADING HIS HORSE A HUNDRED YARDS BROUGHT THEM TO THE EDGE OF A SLIGHT BOWL IN THE PLAINS WITH A LITTLE MOISTURE AROUND WHICH PEWEES WERE FLYING
8791-291101-0073 AND HIS HEART LEAPED TO SEE BESIDE IT A TINY HOUSE OF UNPAINTED BOARDS WIRES STRETCHED FROM ONE WINDOW ALONG THE DEPRESSION WHICH LED WESTWARD UNTIL THEY DISAPPEARED IN THE ENDLESS HORIZON AND AS HE PAUSED TO SURVEY A SHARP BELL RANG
8791-291101-0074 HELLO IS THAT ANNIE CAME FAINTLY ACROSS THE SILENCE HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND SAW THAT IT WAS ONLY ELEVEN I'LL TALK TO CASEY ABOUT WALDRON HE SAID GUILTILY RELIEF FOR HIS ESCAPE

8791-291101-0079 AND THE THOUGHT OF THEIR LITTLE SITTING ROOM AND THE KIDS PLAYING BEHIND HER WARMED HIS BLOOD I GOT RUN AWAY WITH ON THE PLAINS BUT I'M ALL RIGHT HER FRIGHTENED EJACULATION THRILLED HIM WITH LOVING PRIDE

8791-291101-0083 AND IN A CURIOUS EXALTATION OF MIND RODE ON DREAMILY HE NOTICED THE FLOWERS IN THE COARSE GRASS WATCHED THE WILD DOVES FLYING WITH THEIR QUICK STRONG WING BEATS
8791-291101-0084 AND SWUNG HIS EYE JOYFULLY AROUND THE BLUE HORIZONS THAT RECEDED UNTIL ONE FELT THE CURVE AND PITCH OF THE WORLD THE MOOD LASTED UNTIL CARGAN REACHED THE FIRST STRAGGLING HOUSES OF THE VILLAGE STREET
8791-291101-0085 SO THAT HE ENTERED UPON THE RUTTY HIGHWAY BETWEEN DIRT SIDEWALKS WITH REGRET AS ONE WHOSE HOLIDAY WAS ENDING HE SCARCELY NOTICED THE LOITERERS WHO STARED AT HIM OR THOUGHT OF HIS STREAKED FACE HIS TROUSERS SPLIT AT THE KNEE HIS HAT LOST ON THE WILD RIDE
8791-291101-0086 BUT AS HE PLODDED ONWARD THE ATMOSPHERE OF TOWN HAD ITS EFFECT HIS EYE BEGAN TO TAKE NOTE OF THE SIZE OF THE SHOPS GLITTERING UNDER THEIR FALSE FRONTS THE NEW HOUSES BEHIND ROWS OF STIFF YOUNG TREES THE NUMBER AND MAKE OF AUTOMOBILES
8791-291101-0087 HIS SUBCONSCIOUSNESS GRASPED THE FINANCIAL LEVEL OF HAMDEN ALTHOUGH HIS THOUGHTS WERE STILL IN THE WIDE SPACES OF THE PLAINS A BOY RAN OUT FROM THE SIDE WALK TO SELL HIM A PAPER HE STUCK IT IN HIS SIDE POCKET AND SUDDENLY BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE A MAN OF THIS WORLD AGAIN

8791-291101-0092 CARGAN CAREFULLY CONCEALING HIS TORN TROUSERS CLIMBED A STOOL AND BEGAN TO LOOK BACK UPON THE VAGARIES OF THE DAY WITH SULLEN WONDER HE BRUSHED FURTIVELY AT THE CAKED DUST ON HIS LEGS REMEMBERING IRRITABLY THE ELEGANCE OF WALDRON WHOM HE HAD SAVED
8791-291101-0093 IN THE MIRROR OF THE SODA FOUNTAIN HE SAW HIMSELF TORN DIRTY SHRINKING AND THE SIGHT FILLED HIM WITH DISGUST AND ANGER HE FELT AS RIDICULOUS AS WHEN HE HAD COME OUT WITH A GLASS TOO MUCH FROM THE STONEHAM BAR AND TRIPPED OVER THE STEPS OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE
