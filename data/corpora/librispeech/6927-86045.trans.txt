6927-86045-0000 THE KNIGHTS OF THE FISH ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED AN OLD COBBLER WHO WORKED HARD AT HIS TRADE FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND SCARCELY GAVE HIMSELF A MOMENT TO EAT
6927-86045-0001 BUT INDUSTRIOUS AS HE WAS HE COULD HARDLY BUY BREAD AND CHEESE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE AND THEY GREW THINNER AND THINNER DAILY FOR A LONG WHILE
6927-86045-0002 THAT THEY HAD NO APPETITE AND THAT A FEW BLACKBERRIES FROM THE HEDGES WERE A GREAT DEAL NICER THAN A GOOD STRONG BOWL OF SOUP BUT AT LENGTH THERE CAME A DAY WHEN THE COBBLER COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND HE THREW AWAY HIS LAST
6927-86045-0003 AND BORROWING A ROD FROM A NEIGHBOUR HE WENT OUT TO FISH NOW THE COBBLER WAS AS PATIENT ABOUT FISHING AS HE HAD BEEN ABOUT COBBLING FROM DAWN TO DARK HE STOOD ON THE BANKS OF THE LITTLE STREAM WITHOUT HOOKING ANYTHING BETTER THAN AN EEL
6927-86045-0004 BUT THE COBBLER ONLY LAUGHED AND TOLD THEM IT WAS NO BUSINESS OF THEIRS AND WHEN THEY WERE SAFE IN BED HE STOLE OUT AND BURIED THE TWO PIECES IN THE GARDEN BY AND BY TWO BABIES EXACTLY ALIKE LAY IN A CRADLE
6927-86045-0005 AND IN THE GARDEN WERE TWO TALL PLANTS WITH TWO BRILLIANT SHIELDS ON THE TOP YEARS PASSED AWAY AND THE BABIES WERE ALMOST MEN THEY WERE TIRED OF LIVING QUIETLY AT HOME BEING MISTAKEN FOR EACH OTHER BY EVERYBODY THEY SAW
6927-86045-0006 AND DETERMINED TO SET OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO SEEK ADVENTURES SO ONE FINE MORNING THE TWO BROTHERS LEFT THE HUT AND WALKED TOGETHER TO THE PLACE WHERE THE GREAT ROAD DIVIDED
6927-86045-0007 THERE THEY EMBRACED AND PARTED PROMISING THAT IF ANYTHING REMARKABLE HAD HAPPENED TO EITHER HE WOULD RETURN TO THE CROSS ROADS AND WAIT TILL HIS BROTHER CAME THE YOUTH WHO TOOK THE PATH THAT RAN EASTWARDS ARRIVED PRESENTLY AT A LARGE CITY
6927-86045-0008 WHERE HE FOUND EVERYBODY STANDING AT THE DOORS WRINGING THEIR HANDS AND WEEPING BITTERLY WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED HE PAUSING AND LOOKING ROUND AND A MAN REPLIED IN A FALTERING VOICE
6927-86045-0009 BUT WHERE IS THE PRINCESS SAID THE YOUNG MAN ONCE MORE AND AGAIN THE MAN ANSWERED HIM SHE IS STANDING UNDER A TREE A MILE AWAY WAITING FOR THE DRAGON THIS TIME
6927-86045-0010 SHE FELT MORE FORSAKEN THAN BEFORE BUT IN REALITY IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES BEFORE HE CAME BACK GALLOPING FURIOUSLY ON A HORSE HE HAD BORROWED AND CARRYING A HUGE MIRROR ACROSS ITS NECK I AM IN TIME THEN
6927-86045-0011 WHEN THE FLAP OF THE DRAGON'S WINGS COULD BE PLAINLY HEARD HE TOSSED HIS HEAD WITH DELIGHT AT THE SIGHT OF HER AND APPROACHED SLOWLY TO THE PLACE WHERE SHE STOOD A LITTLE IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR THEN STILL LOOKING THE MONSTER STEADILY IN THE FACE
6927-86045-0012 THE PRINCESS HAD NOT KNOWN WHEN SHE OBEYED THE ORDERS OF THE KNIGHT OF THE FISH WHAT SHE EXPECTED TO HAPPEN WOULD THE DRAGON WITH SNAKY LOCKS BE TURNED TO STONE SHE WONDERED
6927-86045-0013 OR WOULD SOME FIERY SPARK DART FROM THE HEART OF THE MIRROR AND STRIKE HIM DEAD NEITHER OF THESE THINGS OCCURRED BUT INSTEAD THE DRAGON STOPPED SHORT WITH SURPRISE AND RAGE WHEN HE SAW A MONSTER BEFORE HIM AS BIG AND STRONG AS HIMSELF
6927-86045-0014 HE SHOOK HIS MANE WITH RAGE AND FURY THE ENEMY IN FRONT DID EXACTLY THE SAME HE LASHED HIS TAIL AND ROLLED HIS RED EYES AND THE DRAGON OPPOSITE WAS NO WHIT BEHIND HIM OPENING HIS MOUTH TO ITS VERY WIDEST
6927-86045-0015 HE GAVE AN AWFUL ROAR BUT THE OTHER DRAGON ONLY ROARED BACK THIS WAS TOO MUCH AND WITH ANOTHER ROAR WHICH MADE THE PRINCESS SHAKE IN HER SHOES HE FLUNG HIMSELF UPON HIS FOE IN AN INSTANT THE MIRROR LAY AT HIS FEET BROKEN INTO A THOUSAND PIECES
6927-86045-0016 BUT AS EVERY PIECE REFLECTED PART OF HIMSELF THE DRAGON THOUGHT THAT HE TOO HAD BEEN SMASHED INTO ATOMS IT WAS THE MOMENT FOR WHICH THE KNIGHT OF THE FISH HAD WATCHED AND WAITED AND BEFORE THE DRAGON COULD FIND OUT THAT HE WAS NOT HURT AT ALL
6927-86045-0017 WHICH WAS SO LARGE THAT IT WAS THREE MILES ROUND THE FIRST WET DAY AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THE BRIDEGROOM BEGGED THE BRIDE TO SHOW HIM ALL THE ROOMS IN THE PALACE
6927-86045-0018 IT NEEDED A BRAVE MAN TO APPROACH IT FOR IT MADE YOUR HAIR STAND ON END MERELY TO LOOK AT IT IT WAS AS DARK AS THE NIGHT OF A STORM AND AS SILENT AS THE GRAVE BUT THE KNIGHT OF THE FISH KNEW NO FEAR
6927-86045-0019 AND HAD NEVER TURNED HIS BACK ON AN ENEMY SO HE DREW OUT HIS HORN AND BLEW A BLAST THE SOUND AWOKE ALL THE SLEEPING ECHOES IN THE CASTLE AND WAS REPEATED NOW LOUDLY NOW SOFTLY NOW NEAR AND NOW FAR
6927-86045-0020 WHICH BELONGED TO THE UGLIEST OLD WOMAN THAT EVER WAS SEEN WHAT DO YOU WANT SAID SHE TO ENTER HE ANSWERED SHORTLY CAN I REST HERE THIS NIGHT YES OR NO NO NO NO
6927-86045-0021 REPEATED THE ECHOES BETWEEN THE FIERCE SUN AND HIS ANGER AT BEING KEPT WAITING THE KNIGHT OF THE FISH HAD GROWN SO HOT THAT HE LIFTED HIS VISOR AND WHEN THE OLD WOMAN SAW HOW HANDSOME HE WAS SHE BEGAN FUMBLING WITH THE LOCK OF THE GATE
6927-86045-0022 COME IN COME IN SAID SHE SO FINE A GENTLEMAN WILL DO US NO HARM HARM REPEATED THE ECHOES BUT AGAIN THE YOUNG MAN PAID NO HEED LET US GO IN ANCIENT DAME BUT SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
6927-86045-0023 YOU MUST CALL ME THE LADY BERBERISCA SHE ANSWERED SHARPLY AND THIS IS MY CASTLE TO WHICH I BID YOU WELCOME YOU SHALL LIVE HERE WITH ME AND BE MY HUSBAND BUT AT THESE WORDS THE KNIGHT LET HIS SPEAR FALL SO SURPRISED WAS HE
6927-86045-0024 I MARRY YOU WHY YOU MUST BE A HUNDRED AT LEAST CRIED HE YOU ARE MAD ALL I DESIRE IS TO INSPECT THE CASTLE AND THEN GO AS HE SPOKE HE HEARD THE VOICES GIVE A MOCKING LAUGH
6927-86045-0025 BUT THE OLD WOMAN TOOK NO NOTICE AND ONLY BADE THE KNIGHT FOLLOW HER OLD THOUGH SHE WAS IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO TIRE HER THERE WAS NO ROOM HOWEVER SMALL SHE DID NOT LEAD HIM INTO
6927-86045-0026 I HAVE KEPT MY MOST PRECIOUS TREASURE TILL THE LAST SAID THE OLD WOMAN BUT LET ME GO FIRST FOR THE STAIRS ARE STEEP AND YOU MIGHT EASILY BREAK YOUR LEG
6927-86045-0027 SO ON SHE WENT NOW AND THEN CALLING BACK TO THE YOUNG MAN IN THE DARKNESS BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE HAD SLIPPED ASIDE INTO A RECESS TILL SUDDENLY HE PUT HIS FOOT ON A TRAP DOOR WHICH GAVE WAY UNDER HIM AND HE FELL DOWN
6927-86045-0028 AND HAD MADE HERSELF ILL WITH WEEPING AT LAST IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT ONCE MORE HE HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR HIS BROTHER I HAD BETTER SAY NOTHING THOUGHT HE PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO HELP HIM AFTER ALL
6927-86045-0029 SO HE SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE BORNE IN TRIUMPH TO THE PALACE WHERE THE PRINCESS THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS AND SO YOU DID GO TO THE CASTLE SHE ASKED YES OF COURSE I DID ANSWERED HE
6927-86045-0030 I MUST WAS ALL HE ANSWERED AND THE PRINCESS WHO WAS A WISE WOMAN ONLY SAID WELL GO TO BED NOW FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST BE VERY TIRED BUT THE KNIGHT SHOOK HIS HEAD
6927-86045-0031 THE LONG NOSE OF THE OLD WOMAN APPEARED AT THE GRATING BUT THE MOMENT SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS FACE SHE NEARLY FAINTED FROM FRIGHT AS SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE GHOST OF THE YOUTH WHOSE BONES WERE LYING IN THE DUNGEON OF THE CASTLE LADY OF ALL THE AGES
6927-86045-0032 THE WOMAN DID NOT STOP TO HEAR MORE SHE TURNED TO FLY BUT THE KNIGHT'S SWORD ENTERED HER BODY WHERE IS MY BROTHER CRUEL HAG ASKED HE STERNLY I WILL TELL YOU SAID SHE BUT AS I FEEL THAT I AM GOING TO DIE

6927-86045-0034 SHE CAME OUT QUITE WHOLE BUT UGLIER THAN EVER SHE THEN TOLD THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS BROTHER AND HE WENT DOWN INTO THE DUNGEON AND BROUGHT UP HIS BODY AND THE BODIES OF THE OTHER VICTIMS WHO LAY THERE AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL WASHED IN THE MAGIC WATER
6927-86045-0035 THEIR STRENGTH WAS RESTORED TO THEM AND BESIDES THESE HE FOUND IN ANOTHER CAVERN THE BODIES OF THE GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN SACRIFICED TO THE DRAGON AND BROUGHT THEM BACK TO LIFE ALSO
