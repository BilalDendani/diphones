8118-268287-0000 DEAR MOTHER'S SIMPLE FUNERAL TOOK ME ONCE MORE TO MY NATIVE PLACE EVEN WITHOUT MISTER HUXTABLE'S GENEROUS AND NOBLE ASSISTANCE I SHOULD HAVE LAID HER TO REST BY THE SIDE OF THE HUSBAND SHE LOVED SO WELL BUT DIFFICULTIES SORE TO ENCOUNTER AT SUCH A TIME WOULD HAVE MET ME ON EVERY SIDE
8118-268287-0001 MOREOVER THE KIND ACT CHEERED AND LED ME THROUGH DESPONDENCY LIKE THE HAND AND FACE OF GOD CARING LITTLE WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT SAY OR THINK I COULD NOT STAY AT A DISTANCE NATURE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS MY DUTY TO GO AND DUTY OR NOT I COULD NOT STAY AWAY
8118-268287-0002 AND NOW FOR THE LAST TIME I LOOK ON THE FACE AND FORM OF MY MOTHER THAT WHICH I HAVE PLAYED AND TALKED AND LAUGHED WITH THOUGH LATELY NOT MUCH OF LAUGHTER THAT WHICH HAS FED AND CARED FOR ME TILL IT NEEDED MY CARE IN TURN
8118-268287-0003 THAT WHICH I HAVE TODDLED BESIDE OR PROUDLY RUN IN FRONT OF WHOSE ARMS HAVE BEEN ROUND ME WHENEVER I WEPT AND WHOSE BOSOM THE HAVEN OF CHILDHOOD'S STORMS FIRST TO GREET ME WITH SMILES IN THE MORNING AND LAST TO BLESS ME WITH TEARS AT NIGHT EVER LOVING AND NEVER COMPLAINING
8118-268287-0004 IN ONE WORD FOR A THOUSAND MY MOTHER SO FAR AWAY NOW SO HOPELESSLY FAR AWAY THERE IT LIES INDEED I CAN TOUCH IT KISS IT AND EMBRACE IT BUT OH HOW SMALL A PART OF MOTHER AND EVEN THAT PART IS NOT MINE
8118-268287-0005 SO HOLY AND CALM IT LIES SUCH LOVING KINDNESS STILL UPON ITS FEATURES SO NEAR ME BUT IN MYSTERY SO HOPELESSLY FAR AWAY I CAN SEE IT BUT IT NEVER WILL KNOW ME AGAIN I MAY DIE BESIDE IT AND IT CANNOT WEEP
8118-268287-0006 THE LAST LAST LOOK OF ALL ON EARTH THEY MUST HAVE CARRIED ME AWAY I REMEMBER TOTTERING DOWN THE HILL SUPPORTED BY A STALWART ARM
8118-268287-0007 TWO CHILDREN RAN BEFORE ME STOPPING NOW AND THEN TO WONDER AND STRAGGLING TO PICK HEDGE FLOWERS ONE OF THEM BROUGHT ME A BUNCH
8118-268287-0008 NANCY I'LL BE THE DEATH OF THEE WHISPERED A WOMAN'S VOICE THE LITTLE GIRL SHRUNK TO ME FOR SHELTER WITH TIMID TEARS IN HER GREAT BLUE EYES SO I TOOK HER HAND AND LED HER ON AND SOMEHOW IT DID ME GOOD AT INTERVALS THE FUNERAL HYMN WHICH THEY SING ON THE ROAD TO THE GRAVE
8118-268287-0009 FELL SOLEMNLY ON OUR EARS SOME ONE FROM TIME TO TIME GAVE OUT THE WORDS OF A VERSE AND THEN IT WAS SUNG TO A SIMPLE IMPRESSIVE TUNE THAT ANCIENT HYMN WHICH HAS DROWNED SO MANY SOBS I DID NOT HEAR BUT FELT IT
8118-268287-0010 WE ARRIVED AT VAUGHAN SAINT MARY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND DAY THE WHOLE OF THE JOURNEY WAS TO ME A LONG AND TEARFUL DREAM MISTER HUXTABLE CAME WITH US HE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN FURTHER FROM HOME THAN EXETER
8118-268287-0011 AND HIS SINGLE VISIT TO THAT CITY HAD FORMED THE LANDMARK OF HIS LIFE HE NEVER TRIED TO COMFORT ME AS THE OTHERS DID THE IGNORANT MAN KNEW BETTER ALONE I SAT BY MY FATHER'S GRAVE WITH MY MOTHER'S READY BEFORE MY FEET
8118-268287-0012 THEY HAD CAST THE MOULD ON THE OTHER SIDE SO AS NOT TO MOVE MY FATHER'S COVERLET THE POOR OLD PENSIONER HAD BEEN TRUE TO HER PROMISE AND MAN'S LAST GARDEN WAS BLOOMING LIKE HIS FIRST FLOWER BED MY MIND IF ANY I HAD
8118-268287-0013 DEFIANCE AND PRIDE AND SAVAGE DELIGHT IN MISERY WERE ENTIRELY GONE AND DEPRESSION HAD TAKEN THE PLACE OF DEJECTION DEATH NOW SEEMED TO ME THE USUAL AND PROPER CONDITION OF THINGS AND I FELT IT AN IMPERTINENCE THAT I SHOULD STILL BE ALIVE
8118-268287-0014 SO I WAITED WITH HEAVY COMPOSURE TILL SHE SHOULD BE BROUGHT WHO SO OFTEN HAD WALKED THERE WITH ME AT LENGTH SHE WAS COMING FOR GOOD AND ALL AND A SPACE WAS LEFT FOR ME BUT I MUST NOT REPOSE THERE YET I HAD STILL MY TASK BEFORE ME
8118-268287-0015 THE BELL WAS TOLLING FASTER AND THE SHADOWS GROWING LONGER AND THE CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN PLAYING AT HIDE AND SEEK WHERE SOON THEMSELVES SHALL BE SOUGHT IN VAIN HAD FLITTED AWAY FROM SIGHT PERHAPS SCARED AT MY PRESENCE PERHAPS GONE HOME TO TEA TO ENJOY THE FUNERAL AFTERWARDS
8118-268287-0016 THE EVENING WIND HAD CEASED FROM TROUBLING THE YEWS AND THE SHORT LIVED SONGS OF THE BIRDS WERE DONE THE PLACE WAS AS SAD AS I COULD WISH THE SMELL OF NEW EARTH INSPIRED AS IT ALWAYS DOES SOME UNSEARCHABLE EVERLASTING SYMPATHY
8118-268287-0017 BETWEEN THE MATERIAL AND THE CREATURE THE SUN WAS SETTING BEHIND ME SUDDENLY A SHADOW ECLIPSED MY OWN UPON THE RED LOAM ACROSS THE OPEN GRAVE WITHOUT A START AND DREAMILY AS I DID ALL THINGS NOW I TURNED TO SEE WHENCE IT CAME
8118-268287-0018 WITHIN A YARD OF ME STOOD MISTER EDGAR VAUGHAN IN A MOMENT THE OLD FEELING WAS AT MY HEART AND MY WITS WERE ALL AWAKE I OBSERVED THAT HE WAS PALER THAN WHEN I HAD SEEN HIM LAST
8118-268287-0019 AND THE RIGID LOOK WAS WAVERING ON HIS FACE LIKE STEEL REFLECTED BY WATER HE LIFTED HIS HAT TO ME I NEITHER ROSE NOR SPOKE BUT TURNED AND WATCHED HIM CLARA HE SAID IN A LOW EARNEST VOICE I SEE YOU ARE STILL THE SAME
8118-268287-0020 WILL NO DEPTH OF GRIEF NO LENGTH OF TIME NO VISITATION FROM HIM WHO IS OVER US ALL EVER BEND YOUR ADAMANT AND IMPLACABLE WILL I HEARD WITH SOME SURPRISE HIS ALLUSION TO THE GREAT BEING WHOM HE WAS NOT WONT TO RECOGNISE
8118-268287-0021 BUT I MADE HIM NO REPLY VERY WELL HE RESUMED WITH THE ANCIENT CHILL HARDENING OVER HIS FEATURES SO THEN LET IT BE I AM NOT COME TO OFFER YOU CONDOLENCE WHICH YOU WOULD DESPISE NOR DO I MEAN TO BE PRESENT WHEN YOU WOULD ACCOUNT THE SIGHT OF ME AN INSULT
8118-268287-0022 AND YET I LOVED YOUR MOTHER CLARA I LOVED HER VERY TRULY THIS HE SAID WITH SUCH EMOTION THAT A NEW THOUGHT BROKE UPON ME QUICK AS THE THOUGHT HE ASKED WOULD YOU KNOW WHO KILLED YOUR FATHER AND MY MOTHER TOO I ANSWERED
8118-268287-0023 WHOSE COFFIN I SEE COMING THE FUNERAL TURNED THE CORNER OF THE LANE AND THE DUST ROSE FROM THE BEARERS FEET HE TOOK HIS HAT OFF AND THE PERSPIRATION STOOD UPON HIS FOREHEAD
8118-268287-0024 BETWIXT SUSPENSE AND TERROR AND THE WILDNESS OF GRIEF I WAS OBLIGED TO LEAN ON THE HEADSTONE FOR SUPPORT AND A GIDDINESS CAME OVER ME WHEN I RAISED MY EYES AGAIN THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR ME IN VAIN I WIPED THEM HURRIEDLY AND LOOKED AGAIN
8118-268287-0025 MISTER VAUGHAN WAS GONE BUT ON THE GRASS AT MY FEET LAY A FOLDED LETTER I SEIZED IT QUICKLY AND BROKE THE SEAL THAT MOMENT A WHITE FIGURE APPEARED BETWEEN THE YEW TREES BY THE PORCH IT WAS THE AGED MINISTER LEADING MY MOTHER THE LAST PATH OF ALL
8118-268287-0026 THE BOOK WAS IN HIS HAND AND HIS FORM WAS TALL AND STATELY AND HIS STEP SO SLOW THAT THE WHITE HAIR FELL UNRUFFLED WHILE THE GRAND WORDS ON HIS LIPS CALLED MAJESTY INTO HIS GAZE THRUSTING ASIDE THE LETTER
8118-268287-0027 I FOLLOWED INTO THE CHURCH AND STOOD BEHIND THE OLD FONT WHERE I HAD BEEN BAPTIZED A DARK AND GLOOMY NOOK FIT FOR SUCH AN ENTRANCE SHE WHO HAD CARRIED ME THERE WAS CARRIED PAST IT NOW AND THE PALL WAVED IN THE DAMP COLD AIR AND ALL THE WORLD SEEMED STONE AND MOULD
