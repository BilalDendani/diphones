7754-108640-0000 I REPLIED AS BEST I COULD AS ONLY A TRUE LOVER CAN I SPOKE AT LENGTH AND PERSEVERINGLY OF MY DEVOTION OF MY PASSION OF HER EXCEEDING BEAUTY AND OF MY OWN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION IN CONCLUSION
7754-108640-0001 I DWELT WITH A CONVINCING ENERGY UPON THE PERILS THAT ENCOMPASS THE COURSE OF LOVE THAT COURSE OF TRUE LOVE THAT NEVER DID RUN SMOOTH AND THUS DEDUCED THE MANIFEST DANGER OF RENDERING THAT COURSE UNNECESSARILY LONG
7754-108640-0002 THIS LATTER ARGUMENT SEEMED FINALLY TO SOFTEN THE RIGOR OF HER DETERMINATION SHE RELENTED BUT THERE WAS YET AN OBSTACLE SHE SAID WHICH SHE FELT ASSURED I HAD NOT PROPERLY CONSIDERED
7754-108640-0003 THIS WAS A DELICATE POINT FOR A WOMAN TO URGE ESPECIALLY SO IN MENTIONING IT SHE SAW THAT SHE MUST MAKE A SACRIFICE OF HER FEELINGS STILL FOR ME EVERY SACRIFICE SHOULD BE MADE SHE ALLUDED TO THE TOPIC OF
7754-108640-0004 AGE WAS I AWARE WAS I FULLY AWARE OF THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN US THAT THE AGE OF THE HUSBAND SHOULD SURPASS BY A FEW YEARS EVEN BY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THE AGE OF THE WIFE WAS REGARDED BY THE WORLD AS ADMISSIBLE AND INDEED
7754-108640-0005 AS EVEN PROPER BUT SHE HAD ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE BELIEF THAT THE YEARS OF THE WIFE SHOULD NEVER EXCEED IN NUMBER THOSE OF THE HUSBAND A DISCREPANCY OF THIS UNNATURAL KIND GAVE RISE TOO FREQUENTLY ALAS TO A LIFE OF UNHAPPINESS
7754-108640-0006 NOW SHE WAS AWARE THAT MY OWN AGE DID NOT EXCEED TWO AND TWENTY AND I ON THE CONTRARY PERHAPS WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE YEARS OF MY EUGENIE EXTENDED VERY CONSIDERABLY BEYOND THAT SUM ABOUT ALL THIS
7754-108640-0007 THERE WAS A NOBILITY OF SOUL A DIGNITY OF CANDOR WHICH DELIGHTED WHICH ENCHANTED ME WHICH ETERNALLY RIVETED MY CHAINS I COULD SCARCELY RESTRAIN THE EXCESSIVE TRANSPORT WHICH POSSESSED ME
7754-108640-0008 MY SWEETEST EUGENIE I CRIED WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT WHICH YOU ARE DISCOURSING
7754-108640-0009 BUT WHAT THEN THE CUSTOMS OF THE WORLD ARE SO MANY CONVENTIONAL FOLLIES TO THOSE WHO LOVE AS OURSELVES IN WHAT RESPECT DIFFERS A YEAR FROM AN HOUR I AM TWENTY TWO YOU SAY GRANTED INDEED
7754-108640-0010 YOU MAY AS WELL CALL ME AT ONCE TWENTY THREE NOW YOU YOURSELF MY DEAREST EUGENIE CAN HAVE NUMBERED NO MORE THAN CAN HAVE NUMBERED NO MORE THAN
7754-108640-0011 THAN THAN THAN HERE I PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT IN THE EXPECTATION THAT MADAME LALANDE WOULD INTERRUPT ME BY SUPPLYING HER TRUE AGE
7754-108640-0012 BUT A FRENCHWOMAN IS SELDOM DIRECT AND HAS ALWAYS BY WAY OF ANSWER TO AN EMBARRASSING QUERY SOME LITTLE PRACTICAL REPLY OF HER OWN IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE EUGENIE WHO FOR A FEW MOMENTS PAST HAD SEEMED TO BE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING IN HER BOSOM
7754-108640-0013 AT LENGTH LET FALL UPON THE GRASS A MINIATURE WHICH I IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP AND PRESENTED TO HER KEEP IT SHE SAID WITH ONE OF HER MOST RAVISHING SMILES KEEP IT FOR MY SAKE FOR THE SAKE OF HER WHOM IT TOO FLATTERINGLY REPRESENTS
7754-108640-0014 BESIDES UPON THE BACK OF THE TRINKET YOU MAY DISCOVER PERHAPS THE VERY INFORMATION YOU SEEM TO DESIRE IT IS NOW TO BE SURE GROWING RATHER DARK BUT YOU CAN EXAMINE IT AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE MORNING IN THE MEANTIME YOU SHALL BE MY ESCORT HOME TO NIGHT
7754-108640-0015 MY FRIENDS ARE ABOUT HOLDING A LITTLE MUSICAL LEVEE I CAN PROMISE YOU TOO SOME GOOD SINGING WE FRENCH ARE NOT NEARLY SO PUNCTILIOUS AS YOU AMERICANS AND I SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN SMUGGLING YOU IN
7754-108640-0016 IN THE CHARACTER OF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS SHE TOOK MY ARM AND I ATTENDED HER HOME THE MANSION WAS QUITE A FINE ONE AND I BELIEVE FURNISHED IN GOOD TASTE OF THIS LATTER POINT HOWEVER I AM SCARCELY QUALIFIED TO JUDGE
7754-108640-0017 FOR IT WAS JUST DARK AS WE ARRIVED AND IN AMERICAN MANSIONS OF THE BETTER SORT LIGHTS SELDOM DURING THE HEAT OF SUMMER MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AT THIS THE MOST PLEASANT PERIOD OF THE DAY IN ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER MY ARRIVAL TO BE SURE
7754-108640-0018 A SINGLE SHADED SOLAR LAMP WAS LIT IN THE PRINCIPAL DRAWING ROOM AND THIS APARTMENT I COULD THUS SEE WAS ARRANGED WITH UNUSUAL GOOD TASTE AND EVEN SPLENDOR BUT TWO OTHER ROOMS OF THE SUITE AND IN WHICH THE COMPANY CHIEFLY ASSEMBLED REMAINED
7754-108640-0019 DURING THE WHOLE EVENING IN A VERY AGREEABLE SHADOW THIS IS A WELL CONCEIVED CUSTOM GIVING THE PARTY AT LEAST A CHOICE OF LIGHT OR SHADE AND ONE WHICH OUR FRIENDS OVER THE WATER COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN IMMEDIATELY ADOPT
7754-108640-0020 THE EVENING THUS SPENT WAS UNQUESTIONABLY THE MOST DELICIOUS OF MY LIFE MADAME LALANDE HAD NOT OVERRATED THE MUSICAL ABILITIES OF HER FRIENDS AND THE SINGING I HERE HEARD
7754-108640-0021 I HAD NEVER HEARD EXCELLED IN ANY PRIVATE CIRCLE OUT OF VIENNA THE INSTRUMENTAL PERFORMERS WERE MANY AND OF SUPERIOR TALENTS THE VOCALISTS WERE CHIEFLY LADIES AND NO INDIVIDUAL SANG LESS THAN WELL
7754-108640-0022 SHE AROSE AT ONCE WITHOUT AFFECTATION OR DEMUR FROM THE CHAISE LONGUE UPON WHICH SHE HAD SAT BY MY SIDE AND ACCOMPANIED BY ONE OR TWO GENTLEMEN AND HER FEMALE FRIEND OF THE OPERA REPAIRED TO THE PIANO IN THE MAIN DRAWING ROOM
7754-108640-0023 I WOULD HAVE ESCORTED HER MYSELF BUT FELT THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSE I HAD BETTER REMAIN UNOBSERVED WHERE I WAS I WAS THUS DEPRIVED OF THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ALTHOUGH NOT OF HEARING HER SING
7754-108640-0024 THE IMPRESSION SHE PRODUCED UPON THE COMPANY SEEMED ELECTRICAL BUT THE EFFECT UPON MYSELF WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE I KNOW NOT HOW ADEQUATELY TO DESCRIBE IT IT AROSE IN PART NO DOUBT FROM THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE WITH WHICH I WAS IMBUED
7754-108640-0025 BUT CHIEFLY FROM MY CONVICTION OF THE EXTREME SENSIBILITY OF THE SINGER
7754-108640-0026 WITH MORE IMPASSIONED EXPRESSION THAN WAS HERS HER UTTERANCE OF THE ROMANCE IN OTELLO
7754-108640-0027 IN THE CAPULETTI IS RINGING IN MY MEMORY YET HER LOWER TONES WERE ABSOLUTELY MIRACULOUS HER VOICE EMBRACED THREE COMPLETE OCTAVES EXTENDING FROM THE CONTRALTO D TO THE D UPPER SOPRANO AND
7754-108640-0028 THOUGH SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL TO HAVE FILLED THE SAN CARLOS EXECUTED WITH THE MINUTEST PRECISION EVERY DIFFICULTY OF VOCAL COMPOSITION ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALES CADENCES OR FIORITURI
7754-108640-0029 IN THE FINAL OF THE SOMNAMBULA SHE BROUGHT ABOUT A MOST REMARKABLE EFFECT AT THE WORDS
7754-108640-0030 HERE IN IMITATION OF MALIBRAN SHE MODIFIED THE ORIGINAL PHRASE OF BELLINI SO AS TO LET HER VOICE DESCEND TO THE TENOR G WHEN BY A RAPID TRANSITION SHE STRUCK THE G ABOVE THE TREBLE STAVE
7754-108640-0031 SPRINGING OVER AN INTERVAL OF TWO OCTAVES UPON RISING FROM THE PIANO AFTER THESE MIRACLES OF VOCAL EXECUTION SHE RESUMED HER SEAT BY MY SIDE WHEN I EXPRESSED TO HER IN TERMS OF THE DEEPEST ENTHUSIASM MY DELIGHT AT HER PERFORMANCE
7754-108640-0032 FEEBLENESS OR RATHER A CERTAIN TREMULOUS INDECISION OF VOICE IN ORDINARY CONVERSATION HAD PREPARED ME TO ANTICIPATE THAT IN SINGING SHE WOULD NOT ACQUIT HERSELF WITH ANY REMARKABLE ABILITY OUR CONVERSATION WAS NOW
7754-108640-0033 LONG EARNEST UNINTERRUPTED AND TOTALLY UNRESERVED SHE MADE ME RELATE MANY OF THE EARLIER PASSAGES OF MY LIFE AND LISTENED WITH BREATHLESS ATTENTION TO EVERY WORD OF THE NARRATIVE I CONCEALED NOTHING
7754-108640-0034 FELT THAT I HAD A RIGHT TO CONCEAL NOTHING FROM HER CONFIDING AFFECTION ENCOURAGED BY HER CANDOR UPON THE DELICATE POINT OF HER AGE I ENTERED WITH PERFECT FRANKNESS NOT ONLY INTO A DETAIL OF MY MANY MINOR VICES
7754-108640-0035 BUT MADE FULL CONFESSION OF THOSE MORAL AND EVEN OF THOSE PHYSICAL INFIRMITIES THE DISCLOSURE OF WHICH IN DEMANDING SO MUCH HIGHER A DEGREE OF COURAGE IS SO MUCH SURER AN EVIDENCE OF LOVE I TOUCHED UPON MY COLLEGE INDISCRETIONS UPON MY EXTRAVAGANCES
7754-108640-0036 UPON MY CAROUSALS UPON MY DEBTS UPON MY FLIRTATIONS I EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SPEAK OF A SLIGHTLY HECTIC COUGH WITH WHICH AT ONE TIME I HAD BEEN TROUBLED OF A CHRONIC RHEUMATISM OF A TWINGE OF HEREDITARY GOUT
7754-108640-0037 AND IN CONCLUSION OF THE DISAGREEABLE AND INCONVENIENT BUT HITHERTO CAREFULLY CONCEALED WEAKNESS OF MY EYES UPON THIS LATTER POINT SAID MADAME LALANDE LAUGHINGLY YOU HAVE BEEN SURELY INJUDICIOUS IN COMING TO CONFESSION
7754-108640-0038 FOR WITHOUT THE CONFESSION I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE ACCUSED YOU OF THE CRIME BY THE BY SHE CONTINUED HAVE YOU ANY RECOLLECTION AND HERE I FANCIED THAT A BLUSH
7754-108640-0039 EVEN THROUGH THE GLOOM OF THE APARTMENT BECAME DISTINCTLY VISIBLE UPON HER CHEEK HAVE YOU ANY RECOLLECTION MON CHER AMI OF THIS LITTLE OCULAR ASSISTANT WHICH NOW DEPENDS FROM MY NECK AS SHE SPOKE
7754-108640-0040 SHE TWIRLED IN HER FINGERS THE IDENTICAL DOUBLE EYE GLASS WHICH HAD SO OVERWHELMED ME WITH CONFUSION AT THE OPERA FULL WELL ALAS DO I REMEMBER IT I EXCLAIMED PRESSING PASSIONATELY THE DELICATE HAND WHICH OFFERED THE GLASSES FOR MY INSPECTION
7754-108640-0041 THEY FORMED A COMPLEX AND MAGNIFICENT TOY RICHLY CHASED AND FILIGREED AND GLEAMING WITH JEWELS WHICH EVEN IN THE DEFICIENT LIGHT I COULD NOT HELP PERCEIVING WERE OF HIGH VALUE EH BIEN MON AMI
7754-108640-0042 SHE RESUMED WITH A CERTAIN EMPRESSMENT OF MANNER THAT RATHER SURPRISED ME EH BIEN MON AMI YOU HAVE EARNESTLY BESOUGHT OF ME A FAVOR WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO DENOMINATE PRICELESS YOU HAVE DEMANDED OF ME MY HAND UPON THE MORROW
7754-108640-0043 I MAY ADD TO THE PLEADINGS OF MY OWN BOSOM WOULD I NOT BE ENTITLED TO DEMAND OF YOU A VERY A VERY LITTLE BOON IN RETURN NAME IT I EXCLAIMED WITH AN ENERGY THAT HAD NEARLY DRAWN UPON US THE OBSERVATION OF THE COMPANY
7754-108640-0044 AND RESTRAINED BY THEIR PRESENCE ALONE FROM THROWING MYSELF IMPETUOUSLY AT HER FEET NAME IT MY BELOVED MY EUGENIE MY OWN NAME IT BUT ALAS IT IS ALREADY YIELDED ERE NAMED
7754-108640-0045 YOU SHALL CONQUER THEN MON AMI SAID SHE FOR THE SAKE OF THE EUGENIE WHOM YOU LOVE THIS LITTLE WEAKNESS WHICH YOU HAVE AT LAST CONFESSED THIS WEAKNESS MORE MORAL THAN PHYSICAL AND WHICH
7754-108640-0046 LET ME ASSURE YOU IS SO UNBECOMING THE NOBILITY OF YOUR REAL NATURE SO INCONSISTENT WITH THE CANDOR OF YOUR USUAL CHARACTER AND WHICH IF PERMITTED FURTHER CONTROL WILL ASSUREDLY INVOLVE YOU SOONER OR LATER IN SOME VERY DISAGREEABLE SCRAPE
