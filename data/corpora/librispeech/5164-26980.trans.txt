5164-26980-0000 THEY BROUGHT NO SIGN FROM BALDASSARRE AND IN SPITE OF SPECIAL WATCH ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT NO REVELATION OF THE SUSPECTED CONSPIRACY
5164-26980-0001 AND BRIDGED THE PHANTOM CROWDED SPACE OF ANXIETY WITH ACTIVE SYMPATHY IN IMMEDIATE TRIAL THEY BROUGHT THE SPREADING PLAGUE AND THE EXCOMMUNICATION OF SAVONAROLA
5164-26980-0002 AND TO RIVET AGAIN HER ATTACHMENT TO THE MAN WHO HAD OPENED TO HER THE NEW LIFE OF DUTY AND WHO SEEMED NOW TO BE WORSTED IN THE FIGHT FOR PRINCIPLE AGAINST PROFLIGACY
5164-26980-0003 WITHOUT REMEMBERING THAT SHE OWED THIS TRANSCENDENT MORAL LIFE TO FRA GIROLAMO SHE COULD NOT WITNESS THE SILENCING
5164-26980-0004 OF A MAN WHOSE DISTINCTION FROM THE GREAT MASS OF THE CLERGY LAY NOT IN ANY HERETICAL BELIEF NOT IN HIS SUPERSTITIONS BUT IN THE ENERGY WITH WHICH HE SOUGHT TO MAKE THE CHRISTIAN LIFE A REALITY
5164-26980-0005 WITHOUT FEELING HERSELF DRAWN STRONGLY TO HIS SIDE FAR ON IN THE HOT DAYS OF JUNE THE EXCOMMUNICATION FOR SOME WEEKS ARRIVED FROM ROME WAS SOLEMNLY PUBLISHED IN THE DUOMO ROMOLA WENT TO WITNESS THE SCENE
5164-26980-0006 WHICH WAS ONE SOURCE OF HER STRENGTH IT WAS IN MEMORABLE CONTRAST WITH THE SCENE SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO WITNESS THERE INSTEAD OF UPTURNED CITIZEN FACES FILLING THE VAST AREA UNDER THE MORNING LIGHT
5164-26980-0007 AND MAKING A GARLAND OF HOPE AROUND THE MEMORIES OF AGE INSTEAD OF THE MIGHTY VOICE THRILLING ALL HEARTS WITH THE SENSE OF GREAT THINGS VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE TO BE STRUGGLED FOR THERE WERE THE BARE WALLS AT EVENING MADE MORE SOMBRE BY THE GLIMMER OF TAPERS
5164-26980-0008 IN THE PAUSES OF A MONOTONOUS VOICE READING A SENTENCE WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN LONG HANGING UP IN THE CHURCHES
5164-26980-0009 THE QUESTION WHERE THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE ENDS AND THE DUTY OF RESISTANCE BEGINS COULD IN NO CASE BE AN EASY ONE
5164-26980-0010 NOT A COMPROMISE OF PARTIES TO SECURE A MORE OR LESS APPROXIMATE JUSTICE IN THE APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS BUT A LIVING ORGANISM
5164-26980-0011 TO MOST OF THE PIOUS FLORENTINES
5164-26980-0012 THAT BELIEF IN THE DIVINE POTENCY OF THE CHURCH WAS NOT AN EMBRACED OPINION IT WAS AN INALIENABLE IMPRESSION LIKE THE CONCAVITY OF THE BLUE FIRMAMENT AND THE BOLDNESS OF SAVONAROLA'S WRITTEN ARGUMENTS
5164-26980-0013 THAT THE EXCOMMUNICATION WAS UNJUST AND THAT BEING UNJUST IT WAS NOT VALID ONLY MADE THEM TREMBLE THE MORE AS A DEFIANCE CAST AT A MYSTIC IMAGE
5164-26980-0014 THERE WAS NEITHER WEAPON NOR DEFENCE BUT ROMOLA WHOSE MIND HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO DRAW ITS EARLY NOURISHMENT FROM THE TRADITIONAL ASSOCIATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IN WHICH HER FATHER HAD LIVED A LIFE APART
5164-26980-0015 FELT HER RELATION TO THE CHURCH ONLY THROUGH SAVONAROLA HIS MORAL FORCE HAD BEEN THE ONLY AUTHORITY TO WHICH SHE HAD BOWED AND IN HIS EXCOMMUNICATION SHE ONLY SAW THE MENACE OF HOSTILE VICE ON ONE SIDE SHE SAW A MAN
5164-26980-0016 WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ENDS OF PUBLIC VIRTUE AND SPIRITUAL PURITY AND ON THE OTHER THE ASSAULT OF ALARMED SELFISHNESS HEADED BY A LUSTFUL GREEDY LYING AND MURDEROUS OLD MAN
5164-26980-0017 AS POPE ALEXANDER THE SIXTH THE FINER SHADES OF FACT WHICH SOFTEN THE EDGE OF SUCH ANTITHESES ARE NOT APT TO BE SEEN EXCEPT BY NEUTRALS WHO ARE NOT DISTRESSED TO DISCERN SOME FOLLY IN MARTYRS AND SOME JUDICIOUSNESS
5164-26980-0018 IN THE MEN WHO BURNT THEM BUT ROMOLA REQUIRED A STRENGTH THAT NEUTRALITY COULD NOT GIVE AND THIS EXCOMMUNICATION
5164-26980-0019 BY BRINGING INTO PROMINENCE ITS WIDER RELATIONS SEEMED TO COME TO HER LIKE A RESCUE FROM THE THREATENING ISOLATION OF CRITICISM AND DOUBT
5164-26980-0020 FROM THAT SMALLER ANTAGONISM AGAINST FLORENTINE ENEMIES INTO WHICH HE CONTINUALLY FELL IN THE UNCHECKED EXCITEMENT OF THE PULPIT AND PRESENTED HIMSELF SIMPLY AS APPEALING TO THE CHRISTIAN WORLD AGAINST A VICIOUS EXERCISE
5164-26980-0021 OF ECCLESIASTICAL POWER HE WAS A STANDARD BEARER LEAPING INTO THE BREACH LIFE NEVER SEEMS SO CLEAR AND EASY AS WHEN THE HEART IS BEATING FASTER AT THE SIGHT OF SOME GENEROUS SELF RISKING DEED
5164-26980-0022 WE FEEL NO DOUBT THEN WHAT IS THE HIGHEST PRIZE THE SOUL CAN WIN WE ALMOST BELIEVE IN OUR OWN POWER TO ATTAIN IT BY A NEW CURRENT OF SUCH ENTHUSIASM ROMOLA WAS HELPED THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT SUMMER DAYS
5164-26980-0023 THAT WOULD APPRISE HIM OF HER LATE INTERVIEW WITH BALDASSARRE AND THE REVELATION HE HAD MADE TO HER WHAT WOULD SUCH AGITATING DIFFICULT WORDS WIN FROM HIM NO ADMISSION OF THE TRUTH NOTHING PROBABLY BUT A COOL SARCASM ABOUT HER SYMPATHY WITH HIS ASSASSIN
5164-26980-0024 BALDASSARRE WAS EVIDENTLY HELPLESS THE THING TO BE FEARED WAS NOT THAT HE SHOULD INJURE TITO BUT THAT TITO COMING UPON HIS TRACES SHOULD CARRY OUT SOME NEW SCHEME FOR RIDDING HIMSELF OF THE INJURED MAN WHO WAS A HAUNTING DREAD TO HIM
5164-26980-0025 ROMOLA FELT THAT SHE COULD DO NOTHING DECISIVE UNTIL SHE HAD SEEN BALDASSARRE AGAIN AND LEARNED THE FULL TRUTH ABOUT THAT OTHER WIFE LEARNED WHETHER SHE WERE THE WIFE TO WHOM TITO WAS FIRST BOUND THE POSSIBILITIES ABOUT THAT OTHER WIFE
5164-26980-0026 WHICH INVOLVED THE WORST WOUND TO HER HEREDITARY PRIDE MINGLED THEMSELVES AS A NEWLY EMBITTERING SUSPICION WITH THE EARLIEST MEMORIES OF HER ILLUSORY LOVE EATING AWAY THE LINGERING ASSOCIATIONS OF TENDERNESS WITH THE PAST IMAGE OF HER HUSBAND
5164-26980-0027 MADE HER SHRINK FROM TITO WITH A HORROR WHICH WOULD PERHAPS HAVE URGED SOME PASSIONATE SPEECH IN SPITE OF HERSELF IF HE HAD NOT BEEN MORE THAN USUALLY ABSENT FROM HOME LIKE MANY OF THE WEALTHIER CITIZENS IN THAT TIME OF PESTILENCE
5164-26980-0028 HE SPENT THE INTERVALS OF BUSINESS CHIEFLY IN THE COUNTRY
5164-26980-0029 AND SINCE ROMOLA HAD REFUSED TO LEAVE THE CITY HE HAD NO NEED TO PROVIDE A COUNTRY RESIDENCE OF HIS OWN BUT AT LAST IN THE LATER DAYS OF JULY THE ALLEVIATION OF THOSE PUBLIC TROUBLES WHICH HAD ABSORBED HER ACTIVITY AND MUCH OF HER THOUGHT
5164-26980-0030 LEFT ROMOLA TO A LESS COUNTERACTED SENSE OF HER PERSONAL LOT THE PLAGUE HAD ALMOST DISAPPEARED
5164-26980-0031 WHO WERE WRITING URGENT VINDICATORY LETTERS TO ROME ON HIS BEHALF ENTREATING THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE EXCOMMUNICATION ROMOLA'S HEALTHY AND VIGOROUS FRAME WAS UNDERGOING THE REACTION OF LANGUOR INEVITABLE
5164-26980-0032 VARYING HER DIRECTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THE VAGUE HOPE THAT IF BALDASSARRE WERE STILL ALIVE SHE MIGHT ENCOUNTER HIM PERHAPS SOME ILLNESS HAD BROUGHT A NEW PARALYSIS OF MEMORY AND HE HAD FORGOTTEN WHERE SHE LIVED FORGOTTEN EVEN HER EXISTENCE
