1569-141081-0000 IN RETURN FOR THE NEWS WHICH LESTRADE WOULD BRING HOLMES WAS ALWAYS READY TO LISTEN WITH ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS OF ANY CASE UPON WHICH THE DETECTIVE WAS ENGAGED AND WAS ABLE OCCASIONALLY WITHOUT ANY ACTIVE INTERFERENCE
1569-141081-0001 TO GIVE SOME HINT OR SUGGESTION DRAWN FROM HIS OWN VAST KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING LESTRADE HAD SPOKEN OF THE WEATHER AND THE NEWSPAPERS THEN HE HAD FALLEN SILENT PUFFING THOUGHTFULLY AT HIS CIGAR HOLMES LOOKED KEENLY AT HIM
1569-141081-0002 ANYTHING REMARKABLE ON HAND HE ASKED OH NO MISTER HOLMES NOTHING VERY PARTICULAR THEN TELL ME ABOUT IT LESTRADE LAUGHED WELL MISTER HOLMES THERE IS NO USE DENYING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ON MY MIND
1569-141081-0003 AND YET IT IS SUCH AN ABSURD BUSINESS THAT I HESITATED TO BOTHER YOU ABOUT IT ON THE OTHER HAND ALTHOUGH IT IS TRIVIAL IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY QUEER AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A TASTE FOR ALL THAT IS OUT OF THE COMMON
1569-141081-0004 BUT IN MY OPINION IT COMES MORE IN DOCTOR WATSON'S LINE THAN OURS DISEASE SAID I MADNESS ANYHOW AND A QUEER MADNESS TOO YOU WOULDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANYONE LIVING AT THIS TIME OF DAY WHO HAD SUCH A HATRED OF NAPOLEON THE FIRST
1569-141081-0005 THAT HE WOULD BREAK ANY IMAGE OF HIM THAT HE COULD SEE HOLMES SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR THAT'S NO BUSINESS OF MINE SAID HE EXACTLY THAT'S WHAT I SAID BUT THEN WHEN THE MAN COMMITS BURGLARY IN ORDER TO BREAK IMAGES WHICH ARE NOT HIS OWN
1569-141081-0006 THAT BRINGS IT AWAY FROM THE DOCTOR AND ON TO THE POLICEMAN HOLMES SAT UP AGAIN BURGLARY THIS IS MORE INTERESTING LET ME HEAR THE DETAILS LESTRADE TOOK OUT HIS OFFICIAL NOTEBOOK AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY FROM ITS PAGES
1569-141081-0007 IT WAS AT THE SHOP OF MORSE HUDSON WHO HAS A PLACE FOR THE SALE OF PICTURES AND STATUES IN THE KENNINGTON ROAD THE ASSISTANT HAD LEFT THE FRONT SHOP FOR AN INSTANT WHEN HE HEARD A CRASH AND HURRYING IN HE FOUND A PLASTER BUST OF NAPOLEON WHICH STOOD WITH SEVERAL OTHER WORKS OF ART UPON THE COUNTER
1569-141081-0008 LYING SHIVERED INTO FRAGMENTS HE RUSHED OUT INTO THE ROAD BUT ALTHOUGH SEVERAL PASSERS BY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD NOTICED A MAN RUN OUT OF THE SHOP HE COULD NEITHER SEE ANYONE NOR COULD HE FIND ANY MEANS OF IDENTIFYING THE RASCAL
1569-141081-0009 IT SEEMED TO BE ONE OF THOSE SENSELESS ACTS OF HOOLIGANISM WHICH OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME AND IT WAS REPORTED TO THE CONSTABLE ON THE BEAT AS SUCH THE PLASTER CAST WAS NOT WORTH MORE THAN A FEW SHILLINGS AND THE WHOLE AFFAIR APPEARED TO BE TOO CHILDISH FOR ANY PARTICULAR INVESTIGATION
1569-141081-0010 THE SECOND CASE HOWEVER WAS MORE SERIOUS AND ALSO MORE SINGULAR IT OCCURRED ONLY LAST NIGHT IN KENNINGTON ROAD AND WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF MORSE HUDSON'S SHOP THERE LIVES A WELL KNOWN MEDICAL PRACTITIONER NAMED DOCTOR BARNICOT
1569-141081-0011 WHO HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRACTICES UPON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE THAMES HIS RESIDENCE AND PRINCIPAL CONSULTING ROOM IS AT KENNINGTON ROAD BUT HE HAS A BRANCH SURGERY AND DISPENSARY AT LOWER BRIXTON ROAD TWO MILES AWAY THIS DOCTOR BARNICOT IS AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRER OF NAPOLEON
1569-141081-0012 AND HIS HOUSE IS FULL OF BOOKS PICTURES AND RELICS OF THE FRENCH EMPEROR SOME LITTLE TIME AGO HE PURCHASED FROM MORSE HUDSON TWO DUPLICATE PLASTER CASTS OF THE FAMOUS HEAD OF NAPOLEON BY THE FRENCH SCULPTOR DEVINE
1569-141081-0013 ONE OF THESE HE PLACED IN HIS HALL IN THE HOUSE AT KENNINGTON ROAD AND THE OTHER ON THE MANTELPIECE OF THE SURGERY AT LOWER BRIXTON WELL WHEN DOCTOR BARNICOT CAME DOWN THIS MORNING HE WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT HIS HOUSE HAD BEEN BURGLED DURING THE NIGHT
1569-141081-0014 BUT THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN SAVE THE PLASTER HEAD FROM THE HALL IT HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT AND HAD BEEN DASHED SAVAGELY AGAINST THE GARDEN WALL UNDER WHICH ITS SPLINTERED FRAGMENTS WERE DISCOVERED HOLMES RUBBED HIS HANDS
1569-141081-0015 THIS IS CERTAINLY VERY NOVEL SAID HE I THOUGHT IT WOULD PLEASE YOU BUT I HAVE NOT GOT TO THE END YET DOCTOR BARNICOT WAS DUE AT HIS SURGERY AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HIS AMAZEMENT WHEN ON ARRIVING THERE
1569-141081-0016 HE FOUND THAT THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPENED IN THE NIGHT AND THAT THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS SECOND BUST WERE STREWN ALL OVER THE ROOM IT HAD BEEN SMASHED TO ATOMS WHERE IT STOOD IN NEITHER CASE WERE THERE ANY SIGNS WHICH COULD GIVE US A CLUE AS TO THE CRIMINAL OR LUNATIC WHO HAD DONE THE MISCHIEF
1569-141081-0017 NOW MISTER HOLMES YOU HAVE GOT THE FACTS THEY ARE SINGULAR NOT TO SAY GROTESQUE SAID HOLMES MAY I ASK WHETHER THE TWO BUSTS SMASHED IN DOCTOR BARNICOT'S ROOMS WERE THE EXACT DUPLICATES OF THE ONE WHICH WAS DESTROYED IN MORSE HUDSON'S SHOP
1569-141081-0018 THEY WERE TAKEN FROM THE SAME MOULD SUCH A FACT MUST TELL AGAINST THE THEORY THAT THE MAN WHO BREAKS THEM IS INFLUENCED BY ANY GENERAL HATRED OF NAPOLEON CONSIDERING HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF STATUES OF THE GREAT EMPEROR MUST EXIST IN LONDON
1569-141081-0019 IT IS TOO MUCH TO SUPPOSE SUCH A COINCIDENCE AS THAT A PROMISCUOUS ICONOCLAST SHOULD CHANCE TO BEGIN UPON THREE SPECIMENS OF THE SAME BUST
1569-141081-0020 ON THE OTHER HAND THIS MORSE HUDSON IS THE PURVEYOR OF BUSTS IN THAT PART OF LONDON AND THESE THREE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHICH HAD BEEN IN HIS SHOP FOR YEARS SO ALTHOUGH AS YOU SAY THERE ARE MANY HUNDREDS OF STATUES IN LONDON
1569-141081-0021 IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT THESE THREE WERE THE ONLY ONES IN THAT DISTRICT THEREFORE A LOCAL FANATIC WOULD BEGIN WITH THEM WHAT DO YOU THINK DOCTOR WATSON THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF MONOMANIA I ANSWERED
1569-141081-0022 AND ACCOMPANIED BY COMPLETE SANITY IN EVERY OTHER WAY A MAN WHO HAD READ DEEPLY ABOUT NAPOLEON OR WHO HAD POSSIBLY RECEIVED SOME HEREDITARY FAMILY INJURY THROUGH THE GREAT WAR
1569-141081-0023 IN DOCTOR BARNICOT'S HALL WHERE A SOUND MIGHT AROUSE THE FAMILY THE BUST WAS TAKEN OUTSIDE BEFORE BEING BROKEN WHEREAS IN THE SURGERY WHERE THERE WAS LESS DANGER OF AN ALARM IT WAS SMASHED WHERE IT STOOD THE AFFAIR SEEMS ABSURDLY TRIFLING
1569-141081-0024 AND YET I DARE CALL NOTHING TRIVIAL WHEN I REFLECT THAT SOME OF MY MOST CLASSIC CASES HAVE HAD THE LEAST PROMISING COMMENCEMENT YOU WILL REMEMBER WATSON HOW THE DREADFUL BUSINESS OF THE ABERNETTY FAMILY WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO MY NOTICE
1569-141081-0025 BY THE DEPTH WHICH THE PARSLEY HAD SUNK INTO THE BUTTER UPON A HOT DAY I CAN'T AFFORD THEREFORE
1569-141081-0026 THE DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH MY FRIEND HAD ASKED CAME IN A QUICKER AND AN INFINITELY MORE TRAGIC FORM THAN HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED I WAS STILL DRESSING IN MY BEDROOM NEXT MORNING WHEN THERE WAS A TAP AT THE DOOR AND HOLMES ENTERED A TELEGRAM IN HIS HAND HE READ IT ALOUD
1569-141081-0027 WHAT IS IT THEN I ASKED DON'T KNOW MAY BE ANYTHING BUT I SUSPECT IT IS THE SEQUEL OF THE STORY OF THE STATUES IN THAT CASE OUR FRIEND THE IMAGE BREAKER HAS BEGUN OPERATIONS IN ANOTHER QUARTER OF LONDON
1569-141081-0028 THERE'S COFFEE ON THE TABLE WATSON AND I HAVE A CAB AT THE DOOR IN HALF AN HOUR WE HAD REACHED PITT STREET A QUIET LITTLE BACKWATER JUST BESIDE ONE OF THE BRISKEST CURRENTS OF LONDON LIFE
1569-141081-0029 ALL FLAT CHESTED RESPECTABLE AND MOST UNROMANTIC DWELLINGS AS WE DROVE UP WE FOUND THE RAILINGS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE LINED BY A CURIOUS CROWD HOLMES WHISTLED BY GEORGE IT'S ATTEMPTED MURDER AT THE LEAST
1569-141081-0030 NOTHING LESS WILL HOLD THE LONDON MESSAGE BOY THERE'S A DEED OF VIOLENCE INDICATED IN THAT FELLOW'S ROUND SHOULDERS AND OUTSTRETCHED NECK WHAT'S THIS WATSON THE TOP STEPS SWILLED DOWN AND THE OTHER ONES DRY FOOTSTEPS ENOUGH ANYHOW
1569-141081-0031 WELL WELL THERE'S LESTRADE AT THE FRONT WINDOW AND WE SHALL SOON KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THE OFFICIAL RECEIVED US WITH A VERY GRAVE FACE AND SHOWED US INTO A SITTING ROOM WHERE AN EXCEEDINGLY UNKEMPT AND AGITATED ELDERLY MAN CLAD IN A FLANNEL DRESSING GOWN
1569-141081-0032 WAS PACING UP AND DOWN HE WAS INTRODUCED TO US AS THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE MISTER HORACE HARKER OF THE CENTRAL PRESS SYNDICATE IT'S THE NAPOLEON BUST BUSINESS AGAIN SAID LESTRADE YOU SEEMED INTERESTED LAST NIGHT MISTER HOLMES
1569-141081-0033 SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO BE PRESENT NOW THAT THE AFFAIR HAS TAKEN A VERY MUCH GRAVER TURN WHAT HAS IT TURNED TO THEN TO MURDER MISTER HARKER WILL YOU TELL THESE GENTLEMEN EXACTLY WHAT HAS OCCURRED
1569-141081-0034 THAT ALL MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING OTHER PEOPLE'S NEWS
1569-141081-0035 IF I HAD COME IN HERE AS A JOURNALIST I SHOULD HAVE INTERVIEWED MYSELF AND HAD TWO COLUMNS IN EVERY EVENING PAPER AS IT IS I AM GIVING AWAY VALUABLE COPY BY TELLING MY STORY OVER AND OVER TO A STRING OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I CAN MAKE NO USE OF IT MYSELF
1569-141081-0036 HOWEVER I'VE HEARD YOUR NAME MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES AND IF YOU'LL ONLY EXPLAIN THIS QUEER BUSINESS I SHALL BE PAID FOR MY TROUBLE IN TELLING YOU THE STORY HOLMES SAT DOWN AND LISTENED
1569-141081-0037 IT ALL SEEMS TO CENTRE ROUND THAT BUST OF NAPOLEON WHICH I BOUGHT FOR THIS VERY ROOM ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO I PICKED IT UP CHEAP FROM HARDING BROTHERS TWO DOORS FROM THE HIGH STREET STATION A GREAT DEAL OF MY JOURNALISTIC WORK IS DONE AT NIGHT
1569-141081-0038 AND I OFTEN WRITE UNTIL THE EARLY MORNING SO IT WAS TO DAY I WAS SITTING IN MY DEN WHICH IS AT THE BACK OF THE TOP OF THE HOUSE ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN I WAS CONVINCED THAT I HEARD SOME SOUNDS DOWNSTAIRS I LISTENED BUT THEY WERE NOT REPEATED
1569-141081-0039 AND I CONCLUDED THAT THEY CAME FROM OUTSIDE THEN SUDDENLY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LATER THERE CAME A MOST HORRIBLE YELL THE MOST DREADFUL SOUND MISTER HOLMES THAT EVER I HEARD IT WILL RING IN MY EARS AS LONG AS I LIVE
1569-141081-0040 I SAT FROZEN WITH HORROR FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN I SEIZED THE POKER AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS WHEN I ENTERED THIS ROOM I FOUND THE WINDOW WIDE OPEN AND I AT ONCE OBSERVED THAT THE BUST WAS GONE FROM THE MANTELPIECE
1569-141081-0041 WHY ANY BURGLAR SHOULD TAKE SUCH A THING PASSES MY UNDERSTANDING FOR IT WAS ONLY A PLASTER CAST AND OF NO REAL VALUE WHATEVER
1569-141081-0042 THIS WAS CLEARLY WHAT THE BURGLAR HAD DONE SO I WENT ROUND AND OPENED THE DOOR STEPPING OUT INTO THE DARK I NEARLY FELL OVER A DEAD MAN WHO WAS LYING THERE I RAN BACK FOR A LIGHT AND THERE WAS THE POOR FELLOW A GREAT
1569-141081-0043 GASH IN HIS THROAT AND THE WHOLE PLACE SWIMMING IN BLOOD HE LAY ON HIS BACK HIS KNEES DRAWN UP AND HIS MOUTH HORRIBLY OPEN I SHALL SEE HIM IN MY DREAMS
1569-141081-0044 AND THEN I MUST HAVE FAINTED FOR I KNEW NOTHING MORE UNTIL I FOUND THE POLICEMAN STANDING OVER ME IN THE HALL WELL WHO WAS THE MURDERED MAN ASKED HOLMES THERE'S NOTHING TO SHOW WHO HE WAS SAID LESTRADE
1569-141081-0045 YOU SHALL SEE THE BODY AT THE MORTUARY BUT WE HAVE MADE NOTHING OF IT UP TO NOW HE IS A TALL MAN SUNBURNED VERY POWERFUL NOT MORE THAN THIRTY HE IS POORLY DRESSED AND YET DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A LABOURER A HORN HANDLED CLASP KNIFE WAS LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD BESIDE HIM
1569-141081-0046 WHETHER IT WAS THE WEAPON WHICH DID THE DEED OR WHETHER IT BELONGED TO THE DEAD MAN I DO NOT KNOW THERE WAS NO NAME ON HIS CLOTHING AND NOTHING IN HIS POCKETS SAVE AN APPLE SOME STRING A SHILLING MAP OF LONDON AND A PHOTOGRAPH HERE IT IS
1569-141081-0047 IT REPRESENTED AN ALERT SHARP FEATURED SIMIAN MAN WITH THICK EYEBROWS
1569-141081-0048 AND WHAT BECAME OF THE BUST ASKED HOLMES
1569-141081-0049 WE HAD NEWS OF IT JUST BEFORE YOU CAME IT HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE FRONT GARDEN OF AN EMPTY HOUSE IN CAMPDEN HOUSE ROAD IT WAS BROKEN INTO FRAGMENTS I AM GOING ROUND NOW TO SEE IT WILL YOU COME CERTAINLY I MUST JUST TAKE ONE LOOK ROUND
1569-141081-0050 HE EXAMINED THE CARPET AND THE WINDOW THE FELLOW HAD EITHER VERY LONG LEGS OR WAS A MOST ACTIVE MAN SAID HE WITH AN AREA BENEATH IT WAS NO MEAN FEAT TO REACH THAT WINDOW LEDGE AND OPEN THAT WINDOW GETTING BACK WAS COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
1569-141081-0051 ARE YOU COMING WITH US TO SEE THE REMAINS OF YOUR BUST MISTER HARKER THE DISCONSOLATE JOURNALIST HAD SEATED HIMSELF AT A WRITING TABLE I MUST TRY AND MAKE SOMETHING OF IT SAID HE THOUGH I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE FIRST EDITIONS OF THE EVENING PAPERS ARE OUT ALREADY WITH FULL DETAILS
1569-141081-0052 IT'S LIKE MY LUCK YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE STAND FELL AT DONCASTER WELL I WAS THE ONLY JOURNALIST IN THE STAND AND MY JOURNAL THE ONLY ONE THAT HAD NO ACCOUNT OF IT FOR I WAS TOO SHAKEN TO WRITE IT
1569-141081-0053 AND NOW I'LL BE TOO LATE WITH A MURDER DONE ON MY OWN DOORSTEP AS WE LEFT THE ROOM WE HEARD HIS PEN TRAVELLING SHRILLY OVER THE FOOLSCAP THE SPOT WHERE THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BUST HAD BEEN FOUND WAS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
1569-141081-0054 WHICH SEEMED TO RAISE SUCH FRANTIC AND DESTRUCTIVE HATRED IN THE MIND OF THE UNKNOWN IT LAY SCATTERED IN SPLINTERED SHARDS UPON THE GRASS HOLMES PICKED UP SEVERAL OF THEM AND EXAMINED THEM CAREFULLY
1569-141081-0055 I WAS CONVINCED FROM HIS INTENT FACE AND HIS PURPOSEFUL MANNER THAT AT LAST HE WAS UPON A CLUE WELL ASKED LESTRADE HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO YET SAID HE AND YET AND YET
1569-141081-0056 WELL WE HAVE SOME SUGGESTIVE FACTS TO ACT UPON THE POSSESSION OF THIS TRIFLING BUST WAS WORTH MORE IN THE EYES OF THIS STRANGE CRIMINAL THAN A HUMAN LIFE THAT IS ONE POINT THEN THERE IS THE SINGULAR FACT THAT HE DID NOT BREAK IT IN THE HOUSE
1569-141081-0057 OR IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE HOUSE IF TO BREAK IT WAS HIS SOLE OBJECT HE WAS RATTLED AND BUSTLED BY MEETING THIS OTHER FELLOW HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
1569-141081-0058 WELL THAT'S LIKELY ENOUGH BUT I WISH TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION VERY PARTICULARLY TO THE POSITION OF THIS HOUSE IN THE GARDEN OF WHICH THE BUST WAS DESTROYED LESTRADE LOOKED ABOUT HIM IT WAS AN EMPTY HOUSE AND SO HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE DISTURBED IN THE GARDEN
1569-141081-0059 YES BUT THERE IS ANOTHER EMPTY HOUSE FARTHER UP THE STREET WHICH HE MUST HAVE PASSED BEFORE HE CAME TO THIS ONE WHY DID HE NOT BREAK IT THERE SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT EVERY YARD THAT HE CARRIED IT INCREASED THE RISK OF SOMEONE MEETING HIM I GIVE IT UP SAID LESTRADE
1569-141081-0060 HOLMES POINTED TO THE STREET LAMP ABOVE OUR HEADS HE COULD SEE WHAT HE WAS DOING HERE AND HE COULD NOT THERE THAT WAS HIS REASON BY JOVE THAT'S TRUE SAID THE DETECTIVE
1569-141081-0061 NOW THAT I COME TO THINK OF IT DOCTOR BARNICOT'S BUST WAS BROKEN NOT FAR FROM HIS RED LAMP WELL MISTER HOLMES WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH THAT FACT TO REMEMBER IT TO DOCKET IT
1569-141081-0062 WHAT STEPS DO YOU PROPOSE TO TAKE NOW LESTRADE THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY OF GETTING AT IT IN MY OPINION IS TO IDENTIFY THE DEAD MAN THERE SHOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT
1569-141081-0063 WE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD START IN LEARNING WHAT HE WAS DOING IN PITT STREET LAST NIGHT AND WHO IT WAS WHO MET HIM AND KILLED HIM ON THE DOORSTEP OF MISTER HORACE HARKER DON'T YOU THINK SO NO DOUBT AND YET IT IS NOT QUITE THE WAY IN WHICH I SHOULD APPROACH THE CASE
1569-141081-0064 WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN OH YOU MUST NOT LET ME INFLUENCE YOU IN ANY WAY I SUGGEST THAT YOU GO ON YOUR LINE AND I ON MINE WE CAN COMPARE NOTES AFTERWARDS AND EACH WILL SUPPLEMENT THE OTHER VERY GOOD SAID LESTRADE
1569-141081-0065 IF YOU ARE GOING BACK TO PITT STREET YOU MIGHT SEE MISTER HORACE HARKER TELL HIM FOR ME THAT I HAVE QUITE MADE UP MY MIND AND THAT IT IS CERTAIN THAT A DANGEROUS HOMICIDAL LUNATIC WITH NAPOLEONIC DELUSIONS WAS IN HIS HOUSE LAST NIGHT IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR HIS ARTICLE
1569-141081-0066 YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT HOLMES SMILED DON'T I WELL PERHAPS I DON'T BUT I AM SURE THAT IT WILL INTEREST MISTER HORACE HARKER AND THE SUBSCRIBERS OF THE CENTRAL PRESS SYNDICATE NOW WATSON
1569-141081-0067 I THINK THAT WE SHALL FIND THAT WE HAVE A LONG AND RATHER COMPLEX DAY'S WORK BEFORE US I SHOULD BE GLAD LESTRADE IF YOU COULD MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO MEET US AT BAKER STREET AT SIX O'CLOCK THIS EVENING UNTIL THEN I SHOULD LIKE TO KEEP THIS PHOTOGRAPH FOUND IN THE DEAD MAN'S POCKET
1569-141081-0068 IF MY CHAIN OF REASONING SHOULD PROVE TO BE CORRECT
