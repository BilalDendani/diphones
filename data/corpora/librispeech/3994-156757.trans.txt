3994-156757-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE GREAT SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC SAINT MARY'S HALL THANKSGIVING DAY IN CALIFORNIA ANOTHER BROTHER IN LAW MISSUS BRUNNER HAS BECOME TOO CHILDISH TO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUNG GIRLS
3994-156757-0001 HAD BEEN FREQUENTLY REMARKED BEFORE ELITHA'S VISIT AND AFTER HER DEPARTURE THE SAME FRIENDS EXPRESSED REGRET THAT SHE HAD NOT TAKEN US AWAY WITH HER THESE WHISPERED COMMENTS WHICH DID NOT IMPROVE OUR SITUATION SUDDENLY CEASED FOR THE SMALLPOX MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN SONOMA
3994-156757-0002 AND HELPERS WERE NEEDED TO CARE FOR THE AFFLICTED GRANDMA HAD HAD THE DISEASE IN INFANCY AND COULD GO AMONG THE PATIENTS WITHOUT FEAR IN FACT SHE HAD SUCH CONFIDENCE IN HER METHOD OF TREATING IT
3994-156757-0003 THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GEORGIA AND ME VACCINATED WHILE THE EPIDEMIC PREVAILED INSISTING THAT IF WE SHOULD TAKE THE DISEASE SHE COULD NURSE US THROUGH IT WITHOUT DISFIGUREMENT AND WE WOULD THENCEFORTH BE IMMUNE SHE DID NOT EXPOSE US DURING WHAT SHE TERMED THE CATCHING STAGE
3994-156757-0004 BUT AFTER THAT HAD PASSED SHE CALLED US TO SHARE HER WORK AND BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ITS DETAILS AND TAUGHT US HOW TO BREW THE TEAS MAKE THE OINTMENTS AND APPLY THEM I DO NOT REMEMBER A DEATH AMONG HER PATIENTS
3994-156757-0005 ONE WAS OUR PRETTY MISS SALLIE LEWIS WHO HAD THE DREAD DISEASE IN CONFLUENT FORM GRANDMA WAS CALLED HURRIEDLY IN THE NIGHT BECAUSE THE AFFLICTED GIRL IN DELIRIUM HAD LOOSENED THE STRAPS WHICH HELD HER UPON HER BED
3994-156757-0006 BUT COULD NOT KEEP THE CRUEL IMPRINTS FROM HER FACE THE OTHER WAS OUR ARCH ENEMY CASTLE WHO SEEMED SO NEAR DEATH THAT ONE NIGHT AS GRANDMA WAS PEERING INTO THE DARKNESS FOR SIGNAL LIGHTS FROM THE HOMES OF THE SICK
3994-156757-0007 SHE EXCLAIMED IMPULSIVELY HARK CHILDREN THERE GOES THE CATHOLIC BELL COUNT ITS STROKES CASTLE IS A CATHOLIC AND WAS VERY LOW WHEN I SAW HIM TO DAY TOGETHER WE SLOWLY COUNTED THE KNELLS UNTIL SHE STOPPED US SAYING IT'S FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
3994-156757-0008 CASTLE IS NOT SO OLD SHE WAS RIGHT LATER HE CAME TO US TO RECUPERATE AND WAS THE MOST EXACTING AND PROFANE MAN WE EVER WAITED ON HE CONCEIVED A SPECIAL GRUDGE AGAINST GEORGIA
3994-156757-0009 DECLARING THAT SHE HATED CASTLE AND WOULD NOT BE SORRY IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO SPOIL HIS FINE NOSE SO WHEN HE CAME TO US FROM THE SICK ROOM SOURED AND CRESTFALLEN BECAUSE DISEASE HAD DEEPLY PITTED AND SEAMED THAT FEATURE WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN HIS PRIDE SHE LAUGHINGLY WHISPERED
3994-156757-0010 WELL I DON'T CARE MY NOSE COULD NEVER LOOK LIKE HIS EVEN IF I HAD THE SMALLPOX FOR THERE IS NOT SO MUCH OF IT TO SPOIL OUR DISLIKE OF THE MAN BECAME INTENSE AND LATER WHEN WE DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS TO BE BARTENDER AT GRANDPA'S BAR AND BOARD AT OUR HOUSE
3994-156757-0011 THIS WAS MORE SATISFACTION TO GEORGIA THAN TO ME FOR SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DECLARING THAT IF GRANDMA TOOK THAT MAN TO BOARD SHE WOULD BE A SCHWEITZER CHILD NO LONGER
3994-156757-0012 MAKE HER CLOTHES LIKE AMERICAN CHILDREN'S AND THAT SHE KNEW HER FRIEND MISSUS BERGWALD WOULD GIVE HER A HOME IF GRANDMA SHOULD SEND HER AWAY HERE THE MEETING WAS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT GRANDMA WAS STANDING BEHIND US
3994-156757-0013 I FELT THAT I HAD OUTGROWN SUCH CORRECTION NOR HAD I DESERVED IT AND I TOLD HER THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER NEVER STRIKE ME AGAIN THEN I WALKED TO THE HOUSE ALONE A FEW MOMENTS LATER
3994-156757-0014 GEORGIA CAME UP TO OUR ROOM AND FOUND ME DRESSING MYSELF WITH GREATEST CARE IN AMAZEMENT SHE ASKED ELIZA WHERE ARE YOU GOING AND WAS DUMBFOUNDED WHEN I ANSWERED TO FIND ANOTHER HOME FOR US IN THE LOWER HALL I ENCOUNTERED GRANDMA
3994-156757-0015 WHOSE ANGER HAD COOLED AND SHE ASKED THE QUESTION GEORGIA HAD I RAISED MY SLEEVE SHOWED THE WELT ON MY ARM AND REPLIED I AM GOING TO SEE IF I CAN'T FIND A HOME WHERE THEY WILL TREAT ME KINDLY POOR GRANDMA WAS CONSCIENCE STRICKEN
3994-156757-0016 DREW ME INTO HER OWN ROOM AND DID NOT LET ME LEAVE IT UNTIL AFTER SHE HAD SOOTHED MY HURTS AND WE HAD BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN GEORGIA WENT TO MISSUS BERGWALD'S AND REMAINED QUITE A WHILE WHEN SHE CAME BACK SPEAKING ENGLISH AND INSISTING THAT SHE WAS AN AMERICAN
3994-156757-0017 GRANDMA BECAME VERY ANGRY AND THREATENED TO SEND HER AWAY AMONG STRANGERS THEN HESITATED AS IF REALIZING HOW FULLY GEORGIA BELONGED TO ME AND I TO HER AND THAT WE WOULD CLING TOGETHER WHATEVER MIGHT HAPPEN
3994-156757-0018 IN HER PERPLEXITY SHE BESOUGHT MISSUS BERGWALD'S ADVICE NOW MISSUS BERGWALD WAS A NATIVE OF STOCKHOLM A LADY OF RARE CULTURE AND USED THE FRENCH LANGUAGE IN CONVERSING WITH GRANDMA
3994-156757-0019 SHE SPOKE FEELINGLY OF MY LITTLE SISTER
3994-156757-0020 ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE NICER WAYS OF WORK AND LADYLIKE ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHE COULD SEE NO HARM IN GEORGIA WISHING TO REMAIN AN AMERICAN SINCE TO LOVE ONE'S OWN PEOPLE AND COUNTRY WAS NATURAL THEREAFTER GRANDMA CHANGED HER METHODS
3994-156757-0021 SOMETIMES SHE WOULD LET US BRING HER FROM UNDER THE SOFA HER GORGEOUS PRINTS ILLUSTRATING WILHELM TELL AND WOULD REPEAT THE TEXT RELATING TO THE SCENES AS WE EXAMINED EACH PICTURE WITH EAGER INTEREST
3994-156757-0022 WE WERE ALSO ALLOWED TO GO TO SUNDAY SCHOOL OFTENER AND LATER SHE SENT ME PART OF THE TERM TO THE SELECT SCHOOL FOR GIRLS RECENTLY ESTABLISHED BY DOCTOR VER MEHR AN EPISCOPALIAN CLERGYMAN IN FACT
3994-156757-0023 YET THAT DID NOT LESSEN MY ENTHUSIASM I WAS EAGER FOR KNOWLEDGE I ALSO EXPECTED TO MEET FAMILIAR FACES IN THAT GREAT BUILDING WHICH HAD BEEN THE HOME OF MISTER JACOB LEESE BUT UPON ENTERING
3994-156757-0024 I SAW ONLY FINELY DRESSED YOUNG LADIES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE PROMENADING IN THE HALLS AND SMALL GIRLS FLITTING ABOUT IN THE YARD LIKE BRIGHT WINGED BUTTERFLIES SOME HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM HOME AND WERE CALLING OUT THE NEWS OTHERS WERE ENGAGED IN GAMES THAT WERE STRANGE TO ME
3994-156757-0025 THE BELL RANG I FOLLOWED TO THE RECITATION HALL AND WAS ASSIGNED A SEAT BELOW THE REST BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY SMALL SONOMA GIRL YET ENROLLED I MADE SEVERAL LIFE LONG FRIENDS AT THAT INSTITUTE
3994-156757-0026 STILL IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT SAINT MARY'S HALL WAS ESTABLISHED FOR PUPILS WHO HAD BEEN REARED IN THE LAP OF WEALTH AND EASE NOT FOR THOSE WHOSE HANDS WERE ROUGH LIKE MINE NOR WAS THERE A CLASS FOR ME
3994-156757-0027 GRANDMA BELIEVING THAT I HAD GONE TO SCHOOL LONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO FINISH MY STUDIES WITHOUT TEACHERS GEORGIA WAS MORE FORTUNATE WHEN MISS HUTCHINSON OPENED THE YOUNG LADIES SEMINARY IN THE FALL
3994-156757-0028 GRANDMA DECIDED TO LEND IT A HELPING HAND BY SENDING HER A TERM AS A DAY SCHOLAR MY DELIGHTED SISTER WAS SOON IN TOUCH WITH A CROWD OF OTHER LITTLE GIRLS AND BROUGHT HOME MANY OF THEIR BRIGHT SAYINGS FOR MY EDIFICATION
3994-156757-0029 AND I AM TO GO AND YOU ALSO AS HER GUEST GRANDMA WAS PLEASED THAT I WAS INVITED AND DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD SEND A LIBERAL DONATION OF MILK AND CHEESE AS A MARK OF APPRECIATION I CAUGHT MUCH OF GEORGIA'S SPIRIT OF DELIGHT
3994-156757-0030 FOR I HAD A VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE GRAND DINNER GIVEN IN COMMEMORATION OF OUR VERY FIRST LEGALLY APPOINTED THANKSGIVING DAY IN CALIFORNIA I HAD ONLY TO CLOSE MY EYES AND IN THOUGHT WOULD REAPPEAR THE LONGEST AND MOST BOUNTIFULLY SPREAD TABLE I HAD EVER SEEN
3994-156757-0031 TURKEY CHICKEN AND WILD DUCK AT THE ENDS A WHOLE ROASTED PIG IN THE CENTRE AND MORE THAN ENOUGH DELICIOUS ACCOMPANIMENTS TO COVER THE SPACES BETWEEN THEN THE GROWN FOLK DINING FIRST AND THE FLOCK OF HUNGRY CHILDREN COMING LATER
3994-156757-0032 THE SPEAKING LAUGHING AND CLAPPING OF HANDS WITH WHICH THE OLD HOME CUSTOMS WERE INTRODUCED IN THE NEW LAND THERE I WORE A DARK CALICO DRESS AND SUN BONNET
3994-156757-0033 BOTH MADE BY POOR MISSUS MC CUTCHEN OF THE DONNER PARTY WHO HAD TO TAKE IN SEWING FOR A LIVELIHOOD BUT TO THE SEMINARY I SHOULD WEAR GRANDPA'S GIFT A COSTLY ALPACA CHANGEABLE IN THE SUNLIGHT TO SOFT MINGLING BLUISH AND GREENISH COLORS OF THE PEACOCK
3994-156757-0034 ITS WIDE SKIRT REACHED TO MY SHOETOPS AND THE GATHERS TO ITS FULL WAIST WERE GAUGED TO A SHARP PEAK IN FRONT A WIDE OPEN V FROM THE SHOULDER DOWN TO THE PEAK DISPLAYED AN EMBROIDERED WHITE SWISS CHEMISETTE
3994-156757-0035 THE SLEEVES SMALL AT THE WRIST WERE TRIMMED WITH FOLDS OF THE MATERIAL AND A QUILLING OF WHITE LACE AT THE HAND ON THE ALL IMPORTANT MORNING GRANDMA WAS ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD LOOK WELL
3994-156757-0036 AND QUILLED A SOFT WHITE RUCHING AROUND THE FACE WHICH EMPHASIZED THE FRENCHY STYLE AND FINISH SO PLEASING TO GRANDMA DID I LOOK OLD FASHIONED YES FOR GRANDMA SAID THOU ART LIKE A PICTURE I SAW SOMEWHERE LONG AGO
3994-156757-0037 THEN SHE CONTINUED BRIGHTLY HERE ARE THY MITS AND THY LITTLE EMBROIDERED HANDKERCHIEF FOLDED IN A SQUARE
3994-156757-0038 AND COME NOT BACK LATE FOR MILKING THE SEMINARY PLAYGROUND WAS SO NOISY WITH CHATTER AND SCREAMS OF JOY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE GAMES WE PLAYED AND LATER THE DINING ROOM AND ITS OFFERINGS WERE SO SURPRISING AND SO BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED
3994-156757-0039 THAT THE SIGHT NEARLY DEPRIVED ME OF MY APPETITE MUMPS BITE A PICKLE AND SEE IF IT AIN'T SO EXCLAIMED A NEIGHBOR TO WHOM GEORGIA WAS SHOWING HER PAINFUL AND SWOLLEN FACE TRUE ENOUGH THE LEAST TASTE OF ANYTHING SOUR PRODUCED THE TELL TALE SHOCK
3994-156757-0040 AND WE HAD A HURRIED LITTLE TALK WITH A CLOSED WINDOW BETWEEN US AND WERE FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY OUR TALL BROTHER BEN WHO HAD VERY BLUE EYES AND SOFT BROWN HAIR HE WAS THE SECOND OF THE THREE WILDER BROTHERS
3994-156757-0041 WHO HAD BEEN AMONG THE EARLY GOLD SEEKERS AND TRIED ROUGHING IT IN THE MINES THOUGH A NATIVE OF RHODE ISLAND AND OF PURITAN ANCESTRY HE WAS QUITE WESTERN IN APPEARANCE THOUGH NOT A WEALTHY MAN
