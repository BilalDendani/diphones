3135-166688-0003 MATTIE LEE PRICE THE TWILIGHT OF THE FREAKS
3135-166688-0004 FEATS OF STRENGTH HAVE ALWAYS INTERESTED ME GREATLY
3135-166688-0005 THE ONE AMONG THESE WHO DESERVES FIRST MENTION IS CHARLES JEFFERSON WITH WHOSE ACHIEVEMENTS I BECAME QUITE FAMILIAR WHILE WE WERE WORKING IN THE SAME MUSEUM MANY YEARS AGO
3135-166688-0006 I AM CONVINCED THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THE STRONGEST MAN OF HIS TIME AT LIFTING WITH THE BARE HANDS ALONE HE HAD TWO FEATS THAT HE CHALLENGED ANY MORTAL TO DUPLICATE
3135-166688-0007 ONE WAS PICKING UP A HEAVY BLACKSMITH'S ANVIL BY THE HORN AND PLACING IT ON A KITCHEN TABLE FOR THE OTHER HE HAD A BLOCK OF STEEL WHICH AS NEAR AS I CAN REMEMBER MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOURTEEN INCHES LONG
3135-166688-0008 TWELVE INCHES WIDE AND SEVEN INCHES THICK THIS BLOCK LAY ON THE FLOOR AND HIS CHALLENGE WAS FOR ANYONE TO PICK IT UP WITH BARE HANDS I NOTICED THAT IT REQUIRED UNUSUALLY LONG FINGERS TO GRASP IT
3135-166688-0009 SINCE ONE COULD GET ONLY THE THUMB ON ONE SIDE THOUGH THOUSANDS TRIED I NEVER SAW OR HEARD OF ANYONE ELSE WHO COULD JUGGLE HIS ANVIL OR PICK UP THE WEIGHT TRUE
3135-166688-0010 I SAW HIM SURREPTITIOUSLY RUB HIS FINGERS WITH RESIN TO ASSIST IN THE GRIPPING BUT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ONLY OF SLIGHT ASSISTANCE TO THE MARVELOUS GRIP THE MAN POSSESSED
3135-166688-0011 IT IS GENERALLY CONCEDED THAT LOUIS CYR WAS IN HIS BEST DAYS THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE KNOWN WORLD AT ALL ROUND STRAIGHT LIFTING CYR DID NOT GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING AN ATHLETE
3135-166688-0012 FOR HE APPEARED TO BE OVER FAT AND NOT PARTICULARLY MUSCULAR BUT HE MADE RECORDS IN LIFTING WHICH TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE NO OTHER MAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO DUPLICATE JOHN GRUN MARX A LUXEMBERGER
3135-166688-0013 MUST HAVE BEEN AMONG THE STRONGEST MEN IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME I KNEW HIM WE WORKED ON THE SAME BILL SEVERAL TIMES BUT IT WAS AT THE OLYMPIA IN PARIS THAT HE SHONE SUPREME AS A STRONGMAN AND AT THE SAME TIME AS A WEAK ONE
3135-166688-0014 FOR IN SPITE OF HIS SOVEREIGN STRENGTH MARS WAS NO MATCH FOR A PAIR OF BRIGHT EYES ALL A PRETTY WOMAN HAD TO DO WAS TO SMILE AND JOHN WOULD WILT AND PARIS WAS PARIS MARX'S STRENGTH WAS PRODIGIOUS
3135-166688-0015 AND HE JUGGLED HUNDREDS AND TOYED WITH THOUSANDS OF POUNDS AS A CHILD PLAYS WITH A RATTLE HE MUST HAVE WEIGHED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND HE WALKED LIKE A VERITABLE COLOSSUS IN FACT HE REMINDED ME OF A TWO FOOTED BABY ELEPHANT
3135-166688-0016 ALWAYS GOOD NATURED HE MADE A HOST OF FRIENDS BOTH IN THE PROFESSION AND OUT OF IT AFTER YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL WORK HE SETTLED DOWN AS LANDLORD OF A PUBLIC HOUSE IN ENGLAND
3135-166688-0017 HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT HE WAS BEREFT OF HIS ENORMOUS STRENGTH AND THOSE ABOUT HIM HUMORED HIM
3135-166688-0018 HE DIED ALMOST FORGOTTEN EXCEPT BY HIS BROTHER ARTISTS BUT THEY MYSELF AMONG THEM BUILT A MONUMENT TO THIS GOOD NATURED HERCULES WHOSE ONLY CARE WAS TO ENTERTAIN
3135-166688-0019 ONE WHOM I FOUND MOST INTERESTING WAS WILLIAM LE ROY KNOWN AS THE NAIL KING
3135-166688-0020 WHOSE ACT APPEALED TO ME FOR ITS ORIGINALITY
3135-166688-0021 LE ROY WAS BORN IN CINCINNATI OHIO OCTOBER THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE
3135-166688-0022 THE INORDINATE STRENGTH OF HIS JAWS TEETH AND NECK ENABLED HIM TO PUSH A NAIL HELD BETWEEN HIS TEETH THROUGH A ONE INCH BOARD OR TO NAIL TOGETHER WITH HIS TEETH TWO THREE QUARTERS INCH BOARDS
3135-166688-0023 HE COULD DRAW WITH HIS TEETH A LARGE NAIL THAT HAD BEEN DRIVEN COMPLETELY THROUGH A TWO INCH PLANK THEN HE WOULD SCREW AN ORDINARY TWO INCH SCREW INTO A HARDWOOD PLANK WITH HIS TEETH PULL IT OUT WITH HIS TEETH
3135-166688-0024 WHO COULD PULL IT OUT WITH A LARGE PAIR OF PINCERS WHICH HE PROFFERED FOR THE PURPOSE WHEN HE HAD PERFORMED THESE STUNTS IN VARIOUS POSITIONS HE WOULD BEND HIS BODY BACKWARD TILL HIS HEAD POINTED TOWARD THE FLOOR
3135-166688-0025 AND IN THAT POSITION PUSH A NAIL THROUGH A ONE INCH BOARD HELD PERPENDICULARLY IN A METAL FRAME I SAW NO CHANCE FOR TRICKERY IN LE ROY'S ACT
3135-166688-0026 WHO EITHER BY SUPERIOR STRENGTH OR BY A PECULIAR KNACK
3135-166688-0027 AND DRIVE IT THROUGH A ONE INCH BOARD
3135-166688-0028 BOASTING THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW REALLY EXPERT SLEIGHT OF HAND MAGICIANS OF THE WORLD I MET WEYER AT LIEGE BELGIUM WHERE WE HAD AN ALL NIGHT MATCH WITH PLAYING CARDS
3135-166688-0029 HE COULD DUPLICATE THE TRICKS ON THIS OCCASION HOWEVER HE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE THE BOAST GOOD ANOTHER CLEVER PERFORMER OF THOSE DAYS WAS MEXICAN BILLY WELLS WHO WORKED ON THE CURIO PLATFORM
3135-166688-0030 HIS ACT WAS THE OLD STONE BREAKING STUNT ALREADY EXPLAINED EXCEPT THAT HE HAD THE STONES BROKEN ON HIS HEAD INSTEAD OF ON HIS BODY HE PROTECTED HIS HEAD WITH A SMALL BLANKET WHICH HE PASSED FOR EXAMINATION
3135-166688-0031 AND THIS PROTECTION SEEMED EXCUSABLE CONSIDERING THAT HE HAD TO DO AT LEAST SEVEN SHOWS A DAY A STRONG MAN FROM THE AUDIENCE DID THE REAL WORK OF THE ACT BY SWINGING THE HEAVY SLEDGE HAMMER ON THE STONE AS SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING ILLUSTRATION
3135-166688-0032 BUT IF IT WAS NOT WELLS WOULD YELL HARDER HARDER HIT HARDER UNTIL THE STONE WAS BROKEN THE LAST I SAW OF BILLY WAS DURING ONE OF MY ENGAGEMENTS AT THE PALACE THEATER NEW YORK
3135-166688-0033 HE WAS THEN SOLICITING ORDERS FOR SOME PHOTOGRAPH FIRM THE HALCYON DAYS OF HIS BIG MONEY HAVING FADED TO A MEMORY BUT HE HAD BEEN A GOOD SHOWMAN AND HIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST LIKED WORKING ACTS IN THE CURIO AS THE DIME MUSEUM PROFESSION WAS CALLED
3135-166688-0034 OF ALL THE ACTS OF THIS NATURE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN I THINK THE MOST FOOLHARDY WAS THAT OF AN UNDER SIZED ITALIAN WHO LAY ON HIS BACK ON THE FLOOR AND LET FALL FROM HIS HANDS EXTENDED UPWARD AT ARM'S LENGTH
3135-166688-0035 HEAVY WEIGHTS UPON HIS CHEST THE SILLY FOOL I SAID AS MUCH TO HIM AND SOME OTHER THINGS TOO HIS ACT HAD LITTLE ENTERTAINMENT TO SHOW AS COMPARED WITH THE PAIN AND DANGER INVOLVED I DO NOT KNOW WHAT BECAME OF HIM
3135-166688-0036 BUT I CAN GUESS AMONG THE MUSEUM ATTRACTIONS OF THOSE YEARS WAS A MAN NAMED WILSON WHO HAD THE INCREDIBLE CHEST EXPANSION OF TWENTY ONE INCHES
3135-166688-0037 THIS MAN WOULD ALLOW A STRONG LEATHER STRAP ABOUT THE SIZE OF A TRUNK STRAP TO BE BUCKLED ROUND HIS CHEST AND THEN INFLATING HIS LUNGS WOULD BREAK IT WITH VERY LITTLE APPARENT EXERTION
3135-166688-0038 ALTHOUGH HIS EXPANSION WAS ONLY ABOUT SIXTEEN INCHES
3135-166688-0039 ANOTHER SAMSON A GERMAN AMONG OTHER SENSATIONAL FEATS SUCH AS BREAKING COINS WITH HIS FINGERS USED TO FLEX HIS MUSCLES AND BREAK A DOG CHAIN THAT HAD BEEN FASTENED ROUND THE BICEPS OF HIS RIGHT ARM
3135-166688-0040 WHILE HE WAS PERFORMING AT THE AQUARIUM IN LONDON HE ISSUED A CHALLENGE SANDOW THEN A YOUTH WITHOUT REPUTATION ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE WENT UPON THE STAGE DEFEATED HIM AND SINCE SAMSON'S ACT HAD BEEN THE TALK OF THE TOWN
3135-166688-0041 THUS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO INSTANT NOTICE THE BEGINNING OF A CAREER IN WHICH HE ROSE TO THE TOP OF HIS PROFESSION AFTER SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL YEARS ON THE STAGE SANDOW SETTLED DOWN IN LONDON
3135-166688-0042 WHERE I LAST HEARD OF HIM AS CONDUCTING A SCHOOL OF INSTRUCTION IN HEALTH AND STRENGTH METHODS
3135-166688-0043 I RECALL TWO STRONG WOMEN WHO WERE NOTABLY GOOD YUCCA WHO LIFTED A HORSE BY MEANS OF A HARNESS OVER THE SHOULDERS AND LA BLANCHE WHO TOYED WITH HEAVY ARTICLES IN A MOST ENTERTAINING WAY
3135-166688-0044 I REMEMBER THESE LADIES PARTICULARLY BECAUSE BOTH WERE REMARKABLY GOOD TALKERS
3135-166688-0045 LULU HURST KNOWN VARIOUSLY AS THE GEORGIA MAGNET THE ELECTRIC GIRL
3135-166688-0046 CREATED A VERITABLE SENSATION A GENERATION AGO BY A SERIES OF FEATS
3135-166688-0047 HER METHODS CONSISTED IN UTILIZING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE LEVER AND FULCRUM IN A MANNER SO CLEVERLY DISGUISED THAT IT APPEARED TO THE AUDIENCE THAT SOME SUPERNATURAL POWER MUST BE AT WORK ALTHOUGH SHE WAS EXPOSED MANY TIMES
3135-166688-0048 HER SUCCESS WAS SO MARKED THAT SEVERAL OTHER MUSCULAR LADIES ENTERED HER PROVINCE WITH ACTS THAT WERE IN SEVERAL INSTANCES SUPERIOR TO THE ORIGINAL ONE OF THE CLEVEREST OF THESE WAS ANNIE ABBOTT WHO IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY
3135-166688-0049 ALSO CALLED HERSELF THE GEORGIA MAGNET SHE TOOK THE ACT TO ENGLAND AND HER OPENING PERFORMANCE AT THE ALHAMBRA
3135-166688-0050 OF THOSE DAYS THE SECOND SENSATION WAS CREDITED TO THE BULLET PROOF MAN THIS CHAP WORE A JACKET THAT RIFLE BULLETS FIRED POINT BLANK FAILED TO PENETRATE THE COMPOSITION OF THIS JACKET WAS A SECRET
3135-166688-0051 BUT AFTER THE OWNER'S DEATH THE GARMENT WAS RIPPED OPEN AND FOUND TO CONTAIN GROUND GLASS
3135-166688-0052 THE MAGNET FAILED TO ATTRACT AFTER ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HOURS FOR A KEEN WITTED REPORTER DISCOVERED HER METHODS AND PROMPTLY PUBLISHED THEM THE BULLET DETAINER ALSO LASTED ONLY A SHORT TIME ONLY
3135-166688-0053 WHEN MY OPENING ADDED A THIRD SENSATIONAL SURPRISE ONE OF THE LONDON DAILIES ASKED
3135-166688-0054 THAT THEY WERE GUNNING FOR ME IS PROVED BY THE FACT THAT THE SAME NEWSPAPER INVESTIGATOR WHO EXPOSED THE MAGNET CAME UPON THE STAGE OF THE ALHAMBRA AT MY PRESS PERFORMANCE THE SAME STAGE WHERE THE UNHAPPY DIXIE LODE STONE HAD COLLAPSED AND THOUGH HE
3135-166688-0055 BROUGHT ALONG AN ANTIQUE SLAVE IRON WHICH HE SEEMED TO THINK WOULD PUT AN END TO MY PUBLIC CAREER ON THE SPOT I MANAGED TO ESCAPE IN LESS THAN THREE MINUTES WHEN I PASSED BACK HIS IRONS HE GRINNED AT ME AND SAID
3135-166688-0056 AND HE SHOOK ME CORDIALLY BY THE HAND SOME TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO I WAS ON THE BILL WITH MATTIE LEE PRICE WHO THOUGH LESS WELL KNOWN WAS IN MANY WAYS SUPERIOR TO EITHER MISS HURST OR MISS ABBOTT
3135-166688-0057 FOR A TIME SHE WAS A SENSATION OF THE HIGHEST ORDER FOR WHICH THANKS WERE LARGELY DUE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF HER HUSBAND A WONDERFUL LECTURER AND A THOROUGH SHOWMAN I THINK HIS NAME WAS WHITE
3135-166688-0058 WE WORKED TOGETHER AT KOHL AND MIDDLETON'S CHICAGO AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK AT BURTON'S MUSEUM MILWAUKEE BUT WHEN WE MADE THE NEXT JUMP I FOUND THAT WHITE WAS NOT ALONG THEY HAD HAD A FAMILY SQUABBLE
3135-166688-0059 THE OTHER APEX OF THE TRIANGLE BEING A CIRCUS GRAFTER WHO SHIBBOLETHED AT SOME OF THE BRACE GAMES
3135-166688-0060 HE HAD INTERFERED BETWEEN THE COUPLE AND WAS I AM SORRY TO SAY QUITE SUCCESSFUL AS AN INTERFERER BUT HE WAS A DIABOLICAL FAILURE WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO DUPLICATE WHITE'S WORK AS LECTURER
3135-166688-0061 LATELY I HAVE LEARNED THAT SHE DIED IN LONDON IN NINETEEN HUNDRED AND IS BURIED IN CLEMENTS CEMETERY FULHAM THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST POSITIVE DEMONSTRATIONS I HAVE EVER SEEN
3135-166688-0062 MISS PRICE WAS A MARVELOUS PERFORMER BUT WITHOUT HER HUSBAND LECTURER SHE WAS NO LONGER A DRAWING CARD AND DROPPED TO THE LEVEL OF AN ORDINARY ENTERTAINER EVEN LOWER
3135-166688-0063 IN CHAPTER ELEVEN WE READ DOCTOR DESAGULIERS ANALYSIS OF THE MECHANICS OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED STRONGMANSHIP SIMILAR INVESTIGATIONS HAVE ATTENDED THE APPEARANCE OF MORE RECENT PERFORMERS FOR INSTANCE
3135-166688-0064 REVIEWING ONE OF LULU HURST'S PERFORMANCES THE NEW YORK TIMES OF JULY THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR SAID THE PHENOMENON OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHICH MAY BE SEEN NIGHTLY AT WALLACK'S
3135-166688-0065 IS NOT SO MUCH THE FAMOUS GEORGIA GIRL WITH HER MYSTERIOUS MUSCLE AS IS THE AUDIENCE WHICH GATHERS TO WONDER AT HER PERFORMANCE IT IS A PHENOMENON OF STUPIDITY
3135-166688-0066 CHEERFUL ASININITY THEY WILL HELP ON THEIR DECEIVERS THEN FOLLOWS A DESCRIPTION OF HER PERFORMANCE WHICH WAS FAR FROM SUCCESSFUL THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF ONE OF THE COMMITTEE A MAN DESCRIBED AS MISTER THOMAS JOHNSON
3135-166688-0067 A POWERFULLY BUILT ENGRAVER CONNECTED WITH THE CENTURY MAGAZINE MISTER JOHNSON HAD EVIDENTLY CAUGHT HER SECRET
3135-166688-0068 A DISCLOSURE OF THE METHODS EMPLOYED IN A FEW OF HER TESTS
3135-166688-0069 THE SAME GENERAL PRINCIPLES SHOWN HERE BEING USED THROUGHOUT HER PERFORMANCE THESE EXPLANATIONS ARE TAKEN FROM THE FRENCH PERIODICAL LA NATURE
3135-166688-0070 IN WHICH MISTER NELSON W PERRY THUS SUMS UP THE ATTITUDE OF THE PUBLIC IN REGARD TO THIS CLASS OF PERFORMANCE ELECTRICITY IS A MYSTERIOUS AGENT THEREFORE EVERYTHING MYSTERIOUS IS ELECTRIC
3135-166688-0071 OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ELECTRIC GIRL THIS MAGAZINE SAYS IT IS A QUESTION OF A SIMPLE APPLICATION OF THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE LAWS OF MECHANICS CHAPTER OF EQUILIBRIUM
3135-166688-0072 WE PROPOSE TO POINT OUT HERE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SUCH ARTIFICES
3135-166688-0073 THE DATA FURNISHED BY MISTER PERRY AS WELL AS THOSE RESULTING FROM OUR OWN OBSERVATIONS ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTS CONSISTS IN HAVING A MAN OR SEVERAL MEN
3135-166688-0074 THE GIRL FORCES BACK TWO OR THREE MEN WHO IN UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM AND UNDER THE OBLIQUE ACTION OF THE THRUST EXERTED ARE OBLIGED TO FALL BACK THIS FIRST EXPERIMENT IS SO ELEMENTARY AND INFANTILE
3135-166688-0075 THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DWELL UPON IT IN ORDER TO SHOW THE RELATIVE SIZES OF THE PERSONS THE ARTIST HAS SUPPOSED THE LITTLE GIRL TO BE STANDING ON A PLATFORM IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT
3135-166688-0076 BUT IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT WE WITNESSED THIS PLATFORM WAS RENDERED USELESS BY THE FACT THAT THE GIRL WHO PERFORMED THEM WAS OF SUFFICIENT HEIGHT TO REACH THE CUE BY EXTENDING HER ARMS AND STANDING ON TIPTOES
3135-166688-0077 NEXT WE HAVE A SECOND AND MORE COMPLEX EXPERIMENT LESS EASILY EXPLAINED AT FIRST SIGHT TWO MEN FIG TWO
3135-166688-0078 THE GIRL PLACES HER HAND AGAINST THE LOWER END OF THE STICK IN THE POSITION SHOWN AND THE TWO MEN ARE INVITED TO MAKE THE LATTER SLIDE VERTICALLY IN THE GIRL'S HAND WHICH THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO IN SPITE OF THEIR CONSCIENTIOUS AND OFT REPEATED ATTEMPTS
3135-166688-0079 MISTER PERRY EXPLAINS THIS EXERCISE AS FOLLOWS THE MEN ARE REQUESTED TO PLACE THEMSELVES PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND THE GIRL WHO STANDS OPPOSITE THEM PLACES THE PALM OF HER HAND AGAINST THE STICK AND TURNED TOWARD HER
3135-166688-0080 SHE TAKES CARE TO PLACE HER HAND AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE HANDS OF THE TWO MEN SO AS TO GIVE HERSELF A CERTAIN LEVERAGE SHE THEN BEGINS TO SLIDE HER HAND ALONG THE STICK GENTLY AT FIRST AND THEN WITH AN INCREASING PRESSURE
3135-166688-0081 AS IF SHE WISHED TO BETTER THE CONTACT BETWEEN THE STICK AND HER HAND SHE THUS MOVES IT FROM THE PERPENDICULAR AND ASKS THE TWO MEN TO HOLD IT IN A VERTICAL POSITION THIS THEY DO UNDER VERY DISADVANTAGEOUS CONDITIONS
3135-166688-0082 THE STRESS EXERTED BY THE GIRL IS VERY FEEBLE BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND SHE HAS THE LEVER ARM TO HERSELF AND ON THE OTHER
3135-166688-0083 THEY THEN IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE EXERTING A VERTICAL STRESS WHILE IN REALITY THEIR STRESSES ARE HORIZONTAL AND TEND TO KEEP THE STICK IN A VERTICAL POSITION IN ORDER TO REACT AGAINST THE PRESSURE EXERTED AT THE LOWER END OF THE STICK
3135-166688-0084 EVIDENTLY A CERTAIN VERTICAL COMPONENT THAT TENDS TO CAUSE THE STICK TO DESCEND
3135-166688-0085 TO SUPPORT THIS VERTICAL FORCE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
3135-166688-0086 AND ASSUMING THE ROLE OF THE GIRL WITH TWO VERY STRONG MEN AS ADVERSARIES ALL THE EFFORTS MADE TO CAUSE THE STICK TO SLIDE IN THE OPEN HAND FAILED AND THE EXCESS OF WEIGHT DUE TO THE VERTICAL FORCE ALWAYS REMAINED LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE POUNDS
3135-166688-0087 DESPITE THE VERY DETERMINED AND SINCERE STRESSES OF THE TWO MEN WHO UNBEKNOWN TO THEMSELVES WERE EXERTING THEIR STRENGTH IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION IN THE EXPERIMENT REPRESENTED IN FIG THREE
3135-166688-0088 THE TWO MEN ARE REQUESTED TO HOLD THE STICK FIRMLY AND IMMOVABLE BUT THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE UPON THE EXTREMITY SUFFICES TO MOVE THE ARMS AND BODY OF THE SUBJECT SUCH PRESSURE IN THE FIRST PLACE IS EXERTED BUT SLIGHTLY
3135-166688-0089 AND THE STRESSES ARE GRADUALLY INCREASED THEN ALL AT ONCE WHEN THE FORCE EXERTED HORIZONTALLY IS AS GREAT AS POSSIBLE AND THE MEN ARE EXERTING THEIR STRENGTH IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN ORDER TO RESIST IT
3135-166688-0090 THE GIRL ABRUPTLY CEASES THE PRESSURE WITHOUT WARNING AND EXERTS
3135-166688-0091 UNPREPARED FOR THIS CHANGE THE VICTIMS LOSE THEIR EQUILIBRIUM AND FIND THEMSELVES AT THE MERCY OF THE GIRL AND SO MUCH THE MORE SO IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE STRONGER AND THEIR EFFORTS ARE GREATER
3135-166688-0092 WHERE IT CONCERNS THE EASY LIFTING OF A VERY HEAVY PERSON THE TRICK IS NO LESS SIMPLE
3135-166688-0093 GRASP THE SEAT OR ARMS OF THE CHAIR AND IN ENDEAVORING TO RESIST MAKE THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THEIR BODY BEAR UPON THEIR FEET IF THEY DO NOT DO SO AT THE FIRST INSTANT
3135-166688-0094 AND THEY HELP THEREIN UNCONSCIOUSLY THE EXPERIMENTER THEREFORE NEEDS ONLY TO EXERT A HORIZONTAL THRUST WITHOUT DOING ANY LIFTING AND SUCH HORIZONTAL THRUST IS FACILITATED
3135-166688-0095 BY TAKING THE KNEES AS POINTS OF SUPPORT FOR HER ELBOWS AS SOON AS A SLIGHT MOVEMENT IS EFFECTED THE HARDEST PART OF THE WORK IS OVER FOR IT IS ONLY NECESSARY FOR THE GIRL TO CEASE
3135-166688-0096 TO EXERT HER STRESSES IN ORDER TO HAVE THE CHAIR FALL BACK OR MOVE LATERALLY IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER AT ALL EVENTS THE EQUILIBRIUM IS DESTROYED AND BEFORE IT IS ESTABLISHED AGAIN
3135-166688-0097 IT REQUIRES BUT LITTLE DEXTERITY TO MOVE THE SUBJECT ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS WITHOUT A GREAT EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY THE DIFFICULTY IS NOT INCREASED ON SEATING TWO MEN OR THREE MEN
3135-166688-0098 SINCE IN THE LATTER CASE THE THIRD ACTS AS A TRUE COUNTER POISE TO THE FIRST AND THE WHOLE PRETTY WELL RESEMBLES AN APPARATUS OF UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM WHOSE CENTRE OF GRAVITY IS VERY HIGH AND CONSEQUENTLY SO MUCH MORE EASILY DISPLACED
3135-166688-0099 ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS REQUIRE SOME LITTLE SKILL AND PRACTICE BUT ARE ATTENDED WITH NO DIFFICULTY AND UPON THE WHOLE DO NOT MERIT THE ENTHUSIASTIC ARTICLES THAT HAVE GIVEN THE ELECTRIC OR MAGNETIC GIRL HER EUROPEAN REPUTATION
3135-166688-0100 STRONG PEOPLE WHETHER TRICKSTERS OR GENUINE ATHLETES OR BOTH
3135-166688-0101 AND THE WHOLE REPERTOIRE OF THE SO CALLED HUMAN OSTRICH STEADILY DECLINED AND I RECALL ONLY ONE ENGAGEMENT OF A PERFORMER OF THIS TYPE AT A FIRST CLASS THEATER IN THIS COUNTRY DURING THE PRESENT GENERATION AND THAT DATE WAS NOT PLAYED
3135-166688-0102 CREATED A DEMAND FOR FREAKS THAT WAS FAR IN EXCESS OF THE SUPPLY AND MANY HOUSES WERE OBLIGED TO CLOSE BECAUSE NO FREAKS WERE OBTAINABLE EVEN AT THE ENORMOUS INCREASE IN SALARIES THEN IN VOGUE THE SMALL PRICE OF ADMISSION AND THE FACT THAT
3135-166688-0103 FEATURE CURIOS LIKE LALOO
3135-166688-0104 DREW DOWN SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK
3135-166688-0105 AND NOT A FEW OF THE LEADING MANAGERS OF TO DAY'S VAUDEVILLE OWE THEIR START IN LIFE TO THE DIME MUSEUM AMONG THE MUSEUMS THAT WERE VERITABLE GOLD MINES
3135-166688-0106 BRANDENBERG'S OF PHILADELPHIA MOORE'S OF DETROIT AND ROCHESTER
3135-166688-0107 KOHL AND MIDDLETON'S AUSTIN AND STONE'S OF BOSTON ROBINSON OF BUFFALO
3135-166688-0108 GLOBE HARLEM WORTH'S AND THE GAYETY OF NEW YORK THE DIME MUSEUM IS BUT A MEMORY NOW AND IN THREE GENERATIONS IT WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY BE UTTERLY FORGOTTEN
3135-166688-0109 A FEW OF THE ACTS HAD SUFFICIENT INTRINSIC WORTH TO FOLLOW THE MANAGERS INTO VAUDEVILLE BUT THESE HAVE NO PART IN THIS CHRONICLE
