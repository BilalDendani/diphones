4748-25901-0000 CLEAN CLOTHES FOR MISSUS QUINN SELLING CHIPS OR GRUBBING IN THE ASH HEAPS FOR CINDERS BUT HE WAS HONESTLY EARNING HIS LIVING DOING HIS DUTY AS WELL AS HE KNEW HOW AND SERVING THOSE POORER AND MORE HELPLESS THAN HIMSELF
4748-25901-0001 AND FOR THIS HE PAID BY CARRYING THE BUNDLES AND GETTING THE CINDERS FOR HER FIRE FOOD AND CLOTHES HE PICKED UP AS HE COULD AND HIS ONLY FRIEND WAS LITTLE NANNY
4748-25901-0002 HER MOTHER HAD BEEN KIND TO HIM WHEN THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER LEFT HIM ALL ALONE IN THE WORLD AND WHEN SHE TOO PASSED AWAY THE BOY TRIED TO SHOW HIS GRATITUDE BY COMFORTING THE LITTLE GIRL
4748-25901-0003 WHO THOUGHT THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WORLD LIKE HER JACK OLD MISSUS QUINN TOOK CARE OF HER WAITING TILL SHE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO WORK FOR HERSELF BUT NANNY HAD BEEN SICK AND STILL SAT ABOUT
4748-25901-0004 A PALE LITTLE SHADOW OF HER FORMER SELF WITH A WHITE FILM SLOWLY COMING OVER HER PRETTY BLUE EYES THIS WAS JACK'S GREAT TROUBLE
4748-25901-0005 FOR HE WAS A CHEERY LAD AND WHEN THE BASKETS WERE HEAVY THE WAY LONG THE WEATHER BITTER COLD HIS POOR CLOTHES IN RAGS OR HIS STOMACH EMPTY HE JUST WHISTLED AND SOMEHOW THINGS SEEMED TO GET RIGHT
4748-25901-0006 WITH SUCH PATHETIC PATIENCE IN HER LITTLE FACE I DON'T SEE EM BUT I KNOW THEY'RE PRETTY AND I LIKE EM LOTS
4748-25901-0007 AND WHEN HE TRIED TO CHEER HIMSELF UP WITH A GOOD WHISTLE HIS LIPS TREMBLED SO THEY WOULDN'T PUCKER THE POOR DEAR'S EYES COULD BE CURED I AIN'T A DOUBT
4748-25901-0008 DOCTOR WILKINSON'S COOK TOLD ME ONCE THAT HE DONE SOMETHING TO A LADY'S EYES AND ASKED A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT JACK SIGHED A LONG HOPELESS SIGH
4748-25901-0009 AND WENT AWAY TO FILL THE WATER PAILS BUT HE REMEMBERED THE DOCTOR'S NAME AND BEGAN TO WONDER HOW MANY YEARS IT WOULD TAKE TO EARN A HUNDRED DOLLARS
4748-25901-0010 NANNY WAS VERY PATIENT BUT BY AND BY MISSUS QUINN BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT SENDING HER TO SOME ALMSHOUSE FOR SHE WAS TOO POOR TO BE BURDENED WITH A HELPLESS CHILD
4748-25901-0011 THE FEAR OF THIS NEARLY BROKE JACK'S HEART AND HE WENT ABOUT WITH SUCH AN ANXIOUS FACE THAT IT WAS A MERCY NANNY DID NOT SEE IT JACK WAS ONLY TWELVE
4748-25901-0012 BUT HE HAD A HARD LOAD TO CARRY JUST THEN FOR THE THOUGHT OF HIS LITTLE FRIEND DOOMED TO LIFELONG DARKNESS FOR WANT OF A LITTLE MONEY TEMPTED HIM TO STEAL MORE THAN ONCE
4748-25901-0013 AND GAVE HIM THE FIRST FIERCE BITTER FEELING AGAINST THOSE BETTER OFF THAN HE WHEN HE CARRIED NICE DINNERS TO THE GREAT HOUSES AND SAW THE PLENTY THAT PREVAILED THERE
4748-25901-0014 HE COULDN'T HELP FEELING THAT IT WASN'T FAIR FOR SOME TO HAVE SO MUCH AND OTHERS SO LITTLE WHEN HE SAW PRETTY CHILDREN PLAYING IN THE PARK OR DRIVING WITH THEIR MOTHERS SO GAY SO WELL CARED FOR
4748-25901-0015 SO TENDERLY LOVED THE POOR BOY'S EYES WOULD FILL TO THINK OF POOR LITTLE NANNY WITH NO FRIEND IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF AND HE SO POWERLESS TO HELP HER
4748-25901-0016 HE CAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH THE LIKE OF YOU JACK CLENCHED HIS HANDS HARD AS HE WENT DOWN THE STEPS AND SAID TO HIMSELF WITH A MOST UNBOYISH TONE
4748-25901-0017 HE DID GET IT AND IN A MOST UNEXPECTED WAY BUT HE NEVER FORGOT THE DESPERATE FEELING THAT CAME TO HIM THAT DAY
4748-25901-0018 AS HE WAS SAVED FROM DOING BY WHAT SEEMED AN ACCIDENT SOME DAYS AFTER HIS ATTEMPT AT THE DOCTOR'S AS HE WAS GRUBBING IN A NEWLY DEPOSITED ASH HEAP
4748-25901-0019 WITH THE BITTER FEELING VERY BAD AND THE TROUBLE VERY HEAVY HE FOUND A DIRTY OLD POCKET BOOK AND PUT IT IN HIS BOSOM WITHOUT STOPPING TO EXAMINE IT
4748-25901-0020 FOR MANY BOYS AND GIRLS WERE SCRATCHING LIKE A BROOD OF CHICKENS ALL ROUND HIM AND THE PICKINGS WERE UNUSUALLY GOOD SO NO TIME MUST BE LOST FINDINGS IS HAVINGS
4748-25901-0021 WAS ONE OF THE LAWS OF THE ASH HEAP HAUNTERS AND NO ONE THOUGHT OF DISPUTING ANOTHER'S RIGHT TO THE SPOONS AND KNIVES THAT OCCASIONALLY FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE ASH BARRELS WHILE BOTTLES OLD SHOES RAGS AND PAPER
4748-25901-0022 WERE REGULAR ARTICLES OF TRAFFIC AMONG THEM JACK GOT A GOOD BASKETFUL THAT DAY AND WHEN THE HURRY WAS OVER SAT DOWN TO REST AND CLEAR THE DIRT OFF HIS FACE WITH AN OLD SILK DUSTER
4748-25901-0023 WHICH HE HAD PICKED OUT OF THE RUBBISH THINKING MISSUS QUINN MIGHT WASH IT UP FOR A HANDKERCHIEF BUT HE DIDN'T WIPE HIS DIRTY FACE THAT DAY FOR WITH THE RAG OUT TUMBLED A POCKET BOOK
4748-25901-0024 AND ON OPENING IT HE SAW MONEY YES A ROLL OF BILLS WITH TWO FIGURES ON ALL OF THEM THREE TENS AND ONE TWENTY IT TOOK HIS BREATH AWAY FOR A MINUTE
4748-25901-0025 THEN HE HUGGED THE OLD BOOK TIGHT IN BOTH HIS GRIMY HANDS AND ROCKED TO AND FRO ALL IN A HEAP AMONG THE OYSTER SHELLS AND RUSTY TIN KETTLES SAYING TO HIMSELF WITH TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
4748-25901-0026 FOR JACK TORE HOME AT A GREAT PACE AND BURST INTO THE ROOM WAVING THE OLD DUSTER AND SHOUTING HOORAY I'VE GOT IT I'VE GOT IT IT IS NO WONDER MISSUS QUINN THOUGHT HE HAD LOST HIS WITS
4748-25901-0027 THEN SHOWERED THE MONEY INTO NANNY'S LAP AND HUGGED HER WITH ANOTHER HOORAY WHICH ENDED IN A CHOKE WHEN THEY GOT HIM QUIET AND HEARD THE STORY MISSUS QUINN RATHER DAMPED HIS JOY BY TELLING HIM THE MONEY WASN'T HIS
4748-25901-0028 AND HE OUGHT TO ADVERTISE IT BUT I WANT IT FOR NANNY CRIED JACK AND HOW CAN I EVER FIND WHO OWNS IT WHEN THERE WAS EVER SO MANY BARRELS EMPTIED IN THAT HEAP AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THEY CAME FROM
4748-25901-0029 IT'S VERY LIKE YOU WON'T FIND THE OWNER AND YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE BUT IT'S HONEST TO TRY I'M THINKING FOR SOME POOR GIRL MAY HAVE LOST HER EARNIN'S THIS WAY
4748-25901-0030 AND WE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT OURSELVES SAID MISSUS QUINN
4748-25901-0031 NANNY LOOKED VERY SOBER AND JACK GRABBED UP THE MONEY AS IF IT WERE TOO PRECIOUS TO LOSE BUT HE WASN'T COMFORTABLE ABOUT IT
4748-25901-0032 AND AFTER A HARD FIGHT WITH HIMSELF HE CONSENTED TO LET MISSUS QUINN ASK THEIR POLICEMAN WHAT THEY SHOULD DO HE WAS A KINDLY MAN AND WHEN HE HEARD THE STORY SAID HE'D DO WHAT WAS RIGHT
4748-25901-0033 AND IF HE COULDN'T FIND AN OWNER JACK SHOULD HAVE THE FIFTY DOLLARS BACK HOW HARD IT WAS TO WAIT HOW JACK THOUGHT AND DREAMED OF HIS MONEY DAY AND NIGHT
4748-25901-0034 HOW NANNY RAN TO THE DOOR TO LISTEN WHEN A HEAVY STEP CAME UP THE STAIRS AND HOW WISTFULLY THE POOR DARKENED EYES TURNED TO THE LIGHT WHICH THEY LONGED TO SEE AGAIN
4748-25901-0035 HONEST JOHN FLOYD DID HIS DUTY BUT HE DIDN'T FIND THE OWNER SO THE OLD PURSE CAME BACK AT LAST AND NOW JACK COULD KEEP IT WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE
4748-25901-0036 NANNY WAS ASLEEP WHEN IT HAPPENED AND AS THEY SAT COUNTING THE DINGY BILLS MISSUS QUINN SAID TO THE BOY JACK YOU'D BETTER KEEP THIS FOR YOURSELF I
4748-25901-0037 DOUBT IF IT'S ENOUGH TO DO THE CHILD ANY GOOD AND YOU NEED CLOTHES AND SHOES AND A HEAP OF THINGS LET ALONE THE BOOKS YOU HANKER AFTER SO MUCH IT AIN'T LIKELY YOU'LL EVER FIND ANOTHER WALLET
4748-25901-0038 IT'S ALL LUCK ABOUT NANNY'S EYES AND MAYBE YOU ARE ONLY THROWING AWAY A CHANCE YOU'LL NEVER HAVE AGAIN JACK LEANED HIS HEAD ON HIS ARMS AND STARED AT THE MONEY ALL SPREAD OUT THERE
4748-25901-0039 HIS HEARTY BOY'S APPETITE DID LONG FOR BETTER FOOD AND OH
4748-25901-0040 THE BOOKS THAT WOULD GIVE HIM A TASTE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH WAS MORE ENTICING TO HIS WIDE AWAKE YOUNG MIND THAN CLOTHES AND FOOD TO HIS POOR LITTLE BODY IT WASN'T AN EASY THING TO DO
4748-25901-0041 TO THE DEAR LITTLE FACE IN THE TRUNDLE BED AND HE SAID WITH A DECIDED NOD I'LL GIVE NANNY THE CHANCE
4748-25901-0042 MISSUS QUINN WAS A MATTER OF FACT BODY
4748-25901-0043 SAYING BOLDLY TO THE GRUFF SERVANT I WANT TO SEE THE DOCTOR I CAN PAY SO YOU'D BETTER LET ME IN I'M AFRAID CROSS THOMAS WOULD HAVE SHUT THE DOOR IN THE BOY'S FACE AGAIN
4748-25901-0044 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE LITTLE BLIND GIRL WHO LOOKED UP AT HIM SO IMPLORINGLY THAT HE COULDN'T RESIST THE MUTE APPEAL THE DOCTOR'S GOING OUT BUT MAYBE HE'LL SEE YOU A MINUTE
4748-25901-0045 AND WITH THAT HE LED THEM INTO A ROOM WHERE STOOD A TALL MAN PUTTING ON HIS GLOVES
4748-25901-0046 BUT HE WAS SO AFRAID THAT NANNY WOULD LOSE HER CHANCE THAT HE FORGOT HIMSELF AND TOLD THE LITTLE STORY AS FAST AS HE COULD TOLD IT WELL TOO I FANCY FOR THE DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
4748-25901-0047 HIS EYE GOING FROM THE BOY'S EAGER FLUSHED FACE TO THE PALE PATIENT ONE BESIDE HIM AS IF THE TWO LITTLE FIGURES SHABBY THOUGH THEY WERE ILLUSTRATED THE STORY BETTER THAN THE FINEST ARTIST COULD HAVE DONE
4748-25901-0048 WHEN JACK ENDED THE DOCTOR SAT NANNY ON HIS KNEE GENTLY LIFTED UP THE HALF SHUT EYELIDS AND AFTER EXAMINING THE FILM A MINUTE STROKED HER PRETTY HAIR AND
4748-25901-0049 SAID SO KINDLY THAT SHE NESTLED HER LITTLE HAND CONFIDINGLY INTO HIS I THINK I CAN HELP YOU MY DEAR TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE AND I'LL ATTEND TO IT AT ONCE FOR IT'S HIGH TIME SOMETHING WAS DONE
4748-25901-0050 JACK TOLD HIM ADDING WITH A MANLY AIR AS HE SHOWED THE MONEY I CAN PAY YOU SIR IF FIFTY DOLLARS IS ENOUGH QUITE ENOUGH SAID THE DOCTOR WITH A DROLL SMILE
4748-25901-0051 IF IT ISN'T I'LL WORK FOR THE REST IF YOU'LL TRUST ME PLEASE SAVE NANNY'S EYES AND I'LL DO ANY THING TO PAY YOU CRIED JACK GETTING RED AND CHOKY IN HIS EARNESTNESS
4748-25901-0052 THE DOCTOR STOPPED SMILING AND HELD OUT HIS HAND IN A GRAVE RESPECTFUL WAY AS HE SAID I'LL TRUST YOU MY BOY WE'LL CURE NANNY FIRST AND YOU AND I WILL SETTLE THE BILL AFTERWARD
4748-25901-0053 JACK LIKED THAT IT WAS A GENTLEMANLY WAY OF DOING THINGS AND HE SHOWED HIS SATISFACTION BY SMILING ALL OVER HIS FACE AND GIVING THE BIG WHITE HAND A HEARTY SHAKE WITH BOTH HIS ROUGH ONES
4748-25901-0054 THE DOCTOR WAS A BUSY MAN BUT HE KEPT THEM SOME TIME FOR THERE WERE NO CHILDREN IN THE FINE HOUSE
4748-25901-0055 AND IT SEEMED PLEASANT TO HAVE A LITTLE GIRL SIT ON HIS KNEE AND A BRIGHT BOY STAND BESIDE HIS CHAIR AND WHEN AT LAST THEY WENT AWAY THEY LOOKED AS IF HE HAD GIVEN THEM SOME MAGIC MEDICINE
4748-25901-0056 WHICH MADE THEM FORGET EVERY TROUBLE THEY HAD EVER KNOWN NEXT DAY THE KIND MAN CAME TO GIVE NANNY HER CHANCE SHE HAD NO DOUBT AND VERY LITTLE FEAR
4748-25901-0057 BUT LOOKED UP AT HIM SO CONFIDINGLY WHEN ALL WAS READY THAT HE STOOPED DOWN AND KISSED HER SOFTLY BEFORE HE TOUCHED HER EYES LET JACK HOLD MY HANDS THEN I'LL BE STILL AND NOT MIND IF IT HURTS ME
4748-25901-0058 SHE SAID SO JACK PALE WITH ANXIETY KNELT DOWN BEFORE HER AND KEPT THE LITTLE HANDS STEADILY IN HIS ALL THROUGH THE MINUTES THAT SEEMED SO LONG TO HIM WHAT DO YOU SEE MY CHILD
4748-25901-0059 ASKED THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD DONE SOMETHING TO BOTH EYES WITH A QUICK SKILFUL HAND NANNY LEANED FORWARD WITH THE FILM ALL GONE AND ANSWERED WITH A LITTLE CRY OF JOY
4748-25901-0060 THAT WENT TO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO HEARD IT JACK'S FACE I SEE IT OH I SEE IT ONLY A FRECKLED ROUND FACE WITH WET EYES AND TIGHTLY SET LIPS
4748-25901-0061 BUT TO NANNY IT WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE FACE OF AN ANGEL AND WHEN SHE WAS LAID AWAY WITH BANDAGED EYES TO REST IT HAUNTED ALL HER DREAMS FOR IT WAS THE FACE OF THE LITTLE FRIEND WHO LOVED HER BEST
4748-25901-0062 NANNY'S CHANCE WAS NOT A FAILURE AND WHEN SHE SAW THE NEXT DANDELIONS HE BROUGHT HER ALL THE SUNSHINE CAME BACK INTO THE WORLD BRIGHTER THAN EVER FOR JACK WELL MIGHT IT SEEM SO
4748-25901-0063 FOR HIS FIFTY DOLLARS BOUGHT HIM MANY THINGS THAT MONEY SELDOM BUYS THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T TAKE IT AT FIRST BUT WHEN JACK SAID IN THE MANFUL TONE THE DOCTOR LIKED ALTHOUGH IT MADE HIM SMILE
4748-25901-0064 IT WAS A BARGAIN SIR I WISH TO PAY MY DEBTS AND I SHAN'T FEEL HAPPY IF NANNY DON'T HAVE IT ALL FOR HER EYES PLEASE DO I'D RATHER THEN HE TOOK IT
4748-25901-0065 BUT IN CLOTHES AND FOOD AND CARE MANY TIMES OVER FOR IT WAS INVESTED IN A BANK THAT PAYS GOOD INTEREST ON EVERY MITE SO GIVEN JACK DISCOVERED THAT FIFTY DOLLARS WAS FAR LESS THAN MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY
4748-25901-0066 AND BEGGED EARNESTLY TO BE ALLOWED TO WORK FOR THE REST THE DOCTOR AGREED TO THIS AND JACK BECAME HIS ERRAND BOY SERVING WITH A WILLINGNESS THAT MADE A PLEASURE OF DUTY
4748-25901-0067 SOON FINDING THAT MANY COMFORTS QUIETLY GOT INTO HIS LIFE THAT MUCH HELP WAS GIVEN WITHOUT WORDS AND THAT THE DAYS OF HUNGER AND RAGS HEAVY BURDENS AND DUSTY ASH HEAPS WERE GONE BY FOR EVER
4748-25901-0068 FOR WHILE HE WAITED THE BOY STUDIED OR READ AND WHILE THEY DROVE HITHER AND THITHER THE DOCTOR TALKED WITH HIM FINDING AN EAGER MIND AS WELL AS A TENDER HEART AND A BRAVE SPIRIT
4748-25901-0069 UNDER THE ROUGH JACKET OF HIS LITTLE SERVING MAN
