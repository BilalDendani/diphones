4020-180307-0000 I CAN NOT HELP WANTING TO EXPLAIN ALL MY CONDUCT TO YOU AND I HAVE WRITTEN YOU A LETTER BUT WRITTEN BY A GIRL LIKE ME SUCH A LETTER MIGHT SEEM TO BE A LIE UNLESS DEATH HAD SANCTIFIED IT BY ITS AUTHORITY AND INSTEAD OF A LETTER IT WERE A CONFESSION TO DAY I AM ILL
4020-180307-0001 MY MOTHER DIED OF CONSUMPTION AND THE WAY I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED COULD BUT INCREASE THE ONLY HERITAGE SHE EVER LEFT ME BUT I DO NOT WANT TO DIE WITHOUT CLEARING UP FOR YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THAT IS IF WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU WILL STILL TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THE POOR GIRL WHOM YOU LOVED BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY
4020-180307-0002 THIS IS WHAT THE LETTER CONTAINED I SHALL LIKE WRITING IT OVER AGAIN SO AS TO GIVE MYSELF ANOTHER PROOF OF MY OWN JUSTIFICATION
4020-180307-0003 WHICH YOU TOLD ME OF IN THE EVENING NEXT DAY WHEN YOU WERE AT PARIS WAITING FOR YOUR FATHER AND HE DID NOT RETURN
4020-180307-0004 HIS LETTER WHICH I INCLOSE WITH THIS BEGGED ME IN THE MOST SERIOUS TERMS TO KEEP YOU AWAY ON THE FOLLOWING DAY ON SOME EXCUSE OR OTHER AND TO SEE YOUR FATHER WHO WISHED TO SPEAK TO ME AND ASKED ME PARTICULARLY NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT IT
4020-180307-0005 YOU HAD ONLY BEEN GONE AN HOUR WHEN YOUR FATHER PRESENTED HIMSELF
4020-180307-0006 THOSE WHO SET HER IN MOTION YOUR FATHER HAD WRITTEN ME A VERY POLITE LETTER IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT CONSENT TO SEE HIM HE DID NOT PRESENT HIMSELF QUITE AS HE HAD WRITTEN HIS MANNER AT FIRST WAS SO STIFF INSOLENT AND EVEN THREATENING
4020-180307-0007 THAT I HAD TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS IN MY OWN HOUSE AND THAT I HAD NO NEED TO RENDER HIM AN ACCOUNT OF MY LIFE EXCEPT BECAUSE OF THE SINCERE AFFECTION WHICH I HAD FOR HIS SON
4020-180307-0008 IT WAS TRUE BUT HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL I MIGHT BE I OUGHT NOT TO MAKE USE OF MY BEAUTY TO SPOIL THE FUTURE OF A YOUNG MAN BY SUCH EXPENDITURE AS I WAS CAUSING AT THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO DO
4020-180307-0009 I SHOWED HIM THE PAWN TICKETS THE RECEIPTS OF THE PEOPLE TO WHOM I HAD SOLD WHAT I COULD NOT PAWN
4020-180307-0010 AND LIVE WITH YOU WITHOUT BEING A TOO HEAVY EXPENSE I TOLD HIM OF OUR HAPPINESS OF HOW YOU HAD SHOWN ME THE POSSIBILITY OF A QUIETER AND HAPPIER LIFE AND HE ENDED BY GIVING IN TO THE EVIDENCE OFFERING ME HIS HAND AND ASKING PARDON FOR THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST APPROACHED ME
4020-180307-0011 THEN HE SAID TO ME SO MADAME IT IS NOT BY REMONSTRANCES OR BY THREATS BUT BY ENTREATIES THAT I MUST ENDEAVOUR TO OBTAIN FROM YOU A GREATER SACRIFICE THAN YOU HAVE YET MADE FOR MY SON I TREMBLED AT THIS BEGINNING YOUR FATHER CAME OVER TO ME
4020-180307-0012 TOOK BOTH MY HANDS AND CONTINUED IN AN AFFECTIONATE VOICE MY CHILD DO NOT TAKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU AMISS ONLY REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE SOMETIMES IN LIFE CRUEL NECESSITIES FOR THE HEART BUT THAT THEY MUST BE SUBMITTED TO YOU ARE GOOD
4020-180307-0013 YOUR SOUL HAS GENEROSITY UNKNOWN TO MANY WOMEN WHO PERHAPS DESPISE YOU AND ARE LESS WORTHY THAN YOU BUT REMEMBER THAT THERE IS NOT ONLY THE MISTRESS BUT THE FAMILY THAT BESIDES LOVE THERE ARE DUTIES
4020-180307-0014 THAT TO THE AGE OF PASSION SUCCEEDS THE AGE WHEN MAN IF HE IS TO BE RESPECTED MUST PLANT HIMSELF SOLIDLY IN A SERIOUS POSITION MY SON HAS NO FORTUNE
4020-180307-0015 AND YET HE IS READY TO ABANDON TO YOU THE LEGACY OF HIS MOTHER IF HE ACCEPTED FROM YOU THE SACRIFICE WHICH YOU ARE ON THE POINT OF MAKING HIS HONOUR AND DIGNITY WOULD REQUIRE HIM TO GIVE YOU IN EXCHANGE FOR IT THIS INCOME WHICH WOULD ALWAYS PUT YOU OUT OF DANGER OF ADVERSITY
4020-180307-0016 BUT HE CAN NOT ACCEPT THIS SACRIFICE BECAUSE THE WORLD WHICH DOES NOT KNOW YOU WOULD GIVE A WRONG INTERPRETATION TO THIS ACCEPTANCE AND SUCH AN INTERPRETATION MUST NOT TARNISH THE NAME WHICH WE BEAR NO ONE WOULD CONSIDER WHETHER ARMAND LOVES YOU WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM
4020-180307-0017 WHETHER THIS MUTUAL LOVE MEANS HAPPINESS TO HIM AND REDEMPTION TO YOU
4020-180307-0018 TO SELL ALL SHE HAD FOR HIM THEN THE DAY OF REPROACHES AND REGRETS WOULD ARRIVE
4020-180307-0019 ONLY ONE OF MY CHILDREN THE RECOMPENSE THAT I LOOK FOR FROM BOTH YOU ARE YOUNG BEAUTIFUL LIFE WILL CONSOLE YOU YOU ARE NOBLE
4020-180307-0020 WOULD YOU NOT SUFFER ON SEEING THE HINDRANCES SET BY YOUR LOVE TO YOUR LOVER'S LIFE HINDRANCES FOR WHICH YOU WOULD BE POWERLESS TO CONSOLE HIM IF WITH AGE THOUGHTS OF AMBITION SHOULD SUCCEED TO DREAMS OF LOVE THINK OVER ALL THAT MADAME YOU LOVE ARMAND
4020-180307-0021 BY SACRIFICING YOUR LOVE TO HIS FUTURE NO MISFORTUNE HAS YET ARRIVED BUT ONE WILL ARRIVE AND PERHAPS A GREATER ONE THAN THOSE WHICH I FORESEE
4020-180307-0022 SHE LOVES AND SHE TOO HAS MADE THIS LOVE THE DREAM OF HER LIFE
4020-180307-0023 WELL MY DAUGHTER IS ABOUT TO MARRY
4020-180307-0024 THE FAMILY OF THE MAN WHO IS TO BECOME MY SON IN LAW HAS LEARNED WHAT MANNER OF LIFE ARMAND IS LEADING IN PARIS AND HAS DECLARED TO ME THAT THE MARRIAGE MUST BE BROKEN OFF IF ARMAND CONTINUES THIS LIFE THE FUTURE OF A CHILD WHO HAS DONE NOTHING AGAINST YOU AND WHO HAS THE RIGHT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO A HAPPY FUTURE
4020-180307-0025 IS IN YOUR HANDS HAVE YOU THE RIGHT HAVE YOU THE STRENGTH TO SHATTER IT IN THE NAME OF YOUR LOVE AND OF YOUR REPENTANCE MARGUERITE GRANT ME THE HAPPINESS OF MY CHILD
4020-180307-0026 I SAID TO MYSELF ALL THAT YOUR FATHER DARED NOT SAY TO ME THOUGH IT HAD COME TO HIS LIPS TWENTY TIMES THAT I WAS AFTER ALL ONLY A KEPT WOMAN AND THAT WHATEVER EXCUSE I GAVE FOR OUR LIAISON IT WOULD ALWAYS LOOK LIKE CALCULATION ON MY PART
4020-180307-0027 THAT MY PAST LIFE LEFT ME NO RIGHT TO DREAM OF SUCH A FUTURE AND THAT I WAS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR WHICH MY HABITS AND REPUTATION WERE FAR FROM GIVING ANY GUARANTEE
4020-180307-0028 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT ONE DAY THIS OLD MAN WHO WAS NOW IMPLORING ME FOR THE FUTURE OF HIS SON WOULD BID HIS DAUGHTER MINGLE MY NAME WITH HER PRAYERS
4020-180307-0029 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I LOVE YOUR SON
4020-180307-0030 WITH A DISINTERESTED LOVE YES DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAD MADE THIS LOVE THE HOPE THE DREAM THE FORGIVENESS OF MY LIFE IMPLICITLY
4020-180307-0031 THAT KISS THE ONLY CHASTE KISS I HAVE EVER HAD WILL MAKE ME STRONG AGAINST MY LOVE AND THAT WITHIN A WEEK YOUR SON WILL BE ONCE MORE AT YOUR SIDE PERHAPS UNHAPPY FOR A TIME BUT CURED FOREVER
4020-180307-0032 FOR WHICH GOD WILL REWARD YOU BUT I GREATLY FEAR THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO INFLUENCE UPON MY SON OH BE AT REST SIR HE WILL HATE ME I HAD TO SET UP BETWEEN US AS MUCH FOR ME AS FOR YOU AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER
4020-180307-0033 I WROTE TO PRUDENCE TO SAY THAT I ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION OF THE COMTE DE N AND THAT SHE WAS TO TELL HIM THAT I WOULD SUP WITH HER AND HIM I SEALED THE LETTER AND WITHOUT TELLING HIM WHAT IT CONTAINED ASKED YOUR FATHER TO HAVE IT FORWARDED TO ITS ADDRESS ON REACHING PARIS HE INQUIRED OF ME WHAT IT CONTAINED
4020-180307-0034 YOU ARE WITNESS OF WHAT I FELT AS THE HOUR OF OUR SEPARATION APPROACHED
