8183-282977-0000 JOHN MYERS JOHN FLED FROM UNDER THE YOKE OF DOCTOR JOSHUA R NELSON UNTIL WITHIN TWO YEARS OF JACK'S FLIGHT THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN A VERY FINE MAN WITH WHOM JACK FOUND NO FAULT
8183-282977-0001 FOUR MEN APPROACHED HIM THE DOCTOR ONE OF THEM WITH LINE IN HAND THAT SIGN WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD AND JACK RESOLVED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT GET WITHIN TYING DISTANCE OF HIM I DODGED THEM SAID JACK
8183-282977-0002 AND SUCCEEDED IN REACHING PENNSYLVANIA AND THE COMMITTEE HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE FOUR CHILDREN BEHIND JOHN ABRAHAM JANE AND ELLEN JACK'S WIFE HAD BEEN FREED AND HAD COME TO PHILADELPHIA TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE OF HIM
8183-282977-0003 HIS MASTER EVIDENTLY SUPPOSED THAT JACK WOULD BE MEAN ENOUGH TO WISH TO SEE HIS WIFE EVEN IN A FREE STATE AND THAT NO SLAVE WITH SUCH AN UNNATURAL DESIRE COULD BE TOLERATED OR TRUSTED
8183-282977-0004 THAT THE SOONER SUCH ARTICLES WERE TURNED INTO CASH THE BETTER THIS IN SUBSTANCE WAS THE WAY JACK ACCOUNTED FOR THE SUDDEN CHANGE WHICH HAD COME OVER HIS MASTER
8183-282977-0005 IN DEFENSE OF HIS COURSE JACK REFERRED TO THE TREATMENT WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED WHILE IN SERVITUDE UNDER HIS OLD MASTER IN SOMETHING LIKE THE FOLLOWING WORDS I SERVED UNDER MY YOUNG MASTER'S FATHER THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND FROM HIM RECEIVED KIND TREATMENT
8183-282977-0006 I WAS HIS HEAD MAN ON THE PLACE AND HAD EVERYTHING TO LOOK AFTER ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WILLIAM LEE SUSAN JANE BOILE AND AMARIAN LUCRETIA RISTER
8183-282977-0007 LOW IGNORANT MAN NOT ABOVE A COMMON WOOD CHOPPER AND OWNED NO OTHER SLAVE PROPERTY THAN WILLIAM
8183-282977-0008 AGAINST HIM HOWEVER WILLIAM BROUGHT NO ACCUSATION OF ANY VERY SEVERE TREATMENT ON THE CONTRARY
8183-282977-0009 AS THOUGH HE WANTED TO BE GOOD AND GET RELIGION BUT SAID HE COULD NOT WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO BE RICH
8183-282977-0010 EVERYTHING LOOKED HOPELESS IN WILLIAM'S EYES SO FAR AS THE MASTER'S RICHES AND HIS OWN FREEDOM WERE CONCERNED HE CONCLUDED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HIM THE BAG TO HOLD ALONE WILLIAM THEREFORE LAID DOWN THE SHOVEL AND THE HOE
8183-282977-0011 SUSAN JANE CAME FROM NEW MARKET NEAR GEORGETOWN CROSS ROADS WHERE SHE HAD BEEN HELD TO UNREQUITED LABOR
8183-282977-0012 AMARIAN WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE A PERSON OF LIGHT COLOR MEDIUM SIZE WITH A PREPOSSESSING COUNTENANCE AND SMART SHE COULD READ WRITE AND PLAY ON THE PIANO
8183-282977-0013 FROM A CHILD AMARIAN HAD BEEN OWNED BY MISSUS ELIZABETH KEY SCOTT WHO RESIDED NEAR BRACEVILLE BUT AT THE TIME OF HER FLIGHT SHE WAS LIVING AT WESTMINSTER IN THE FAMILY OF A MAN NAMED BOILE SAID TO BE THE CLERK OF THE COURT
8183-282977-0014 CONSEQUENTLY THEY GAVE HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT SHE SPOKE OF HAVING A MOTHER LIVING IN HAGERSTOWN BY THE NAME OF AMARIAN BALLAD ALSO THREE SISTERS WHO WERE SLAVES AND TWO WHO WERE FREE SHE ALSO HAD A BROTHER IN CHAINS IN MISSISSIPPI
8183-282977-0015 EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WILLIAM CARNEY AND ANDREW ALLEN WILLIAM WAS ABOUT FIFTY ONE YEARS OF AGE A MAN OF UNMIXED BLOOD PHYSICALLY HE WAS A SUPERIOR MAN
8183-282977-0016 AND WHEN UNDER ITS INFLUENCE SHE WAS VERY DESPERATE AND ACTED AS THOUGH SHE WANTED TO KILL SOME OF THE SLAVES AFTER THE EVIL SPIRIT LEFT HER AND SHE HAD REGAINED HER WONTED COMPOSURE SHE WOULD PRETEND THAT SHE LOVED HER NEGROES AND WOULD MAKE A GREAT FUSS OVER THEM
8183-282977-0017 NOT INFREQUENTLY SHE WOULD HAVE VERY SERIOUS DIFFICULTY WITH HER OVERSEERS HAVING LICENSE TO DO AS THEY PLEASED THEY WOULD OF COURSE CARRY THEIR CRUELTIES TO THE MOST EXTREME VERGE OF PUNISHMENT
8183-282977-0018 IF A SLAVE WAS MAIMED OR KILLED UNDER THEIR CORRECTION IT WAS NO LOSS OF THEIRS ONE OF THE OVERSEERS BY THE NAME OF BILL ANDERSON ONCE SHOT A YOUNG SLAVE MAN CALLED LUKE
8183-282977-0019 AND WOUNDED HIM SO SERIOUSLY THAT HE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE AT ANOTHER TIME ONE OF THE OVERSEERS BEAT AND KICKED A SLAVE TO DEATH THIS BARBARITY CAUSED THE MISTRESS TO BE VERY MUCH STIRRED UP
8183-282977-0020 AND SHE DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY MORE WHITE OVERSEERS CONDEMNED THEM FOR EVERYTHING AND DECIDED TO CHANGE HER POLICY IN FUTURE AND TO APPOINT HER OVERSEERS FROM HER OWN SLAVES SETTING THE PROPERTY TO WATCH THE PROPERTY
8183-282977-0021 THIS SYSTEM WAS ORGANIZED AND TIMES WERE SOMEWHAT BETTER WILLIAM HAD BEEN HIRED OUT ALMOST HIS ENTIRE LIFE FOR THE LAST TWELVE OR FIFTEEN YEARS HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HIRE HIS TIME FOR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS PER ANNUM
8183-282977-0022 IN NOVEMBER PREVIOUS TO WILLIAM'S ESCAPE HER LONG LOOKED FOR DISSOLUTION TOOK PLACE EVERY BONDMAN WHO WAS OLD ENOUGH TO REALIZE THE NATURE AND IMPORT OF THE CHANGE FELT A GREAT ANXIETY TO LEARN WHAT THE WILL OF THEIR OLD MISTRESS SAID
8183-282977-0023 WHETHER SHE HAD ACTUALLY FREED THEM OR NOT ALAS WHEN THE SECRET WAS DISCLOSED IT WAS ASCERTAINED THAT NOT A FETTER WAS BROKEN NOT A BOND UNLOOSED AND THAT NO PROVISION WHATEVER HAD BEEN MADE LOOKING TOWARDS FREEDOM
8183-282977-0024 IN THIS SAD CASE THE SLAVES COULD IMAGINE NO OTHER FATE THAN SOON TO BE TORN ASUNDER AND SCATTERED THE FACT WAS SOON MADE KNOWN THAT THE HIGH SHERIFF HAD ADMINISTERED ON THE ESTATE OF THE LATE MISTRESS
8183-282977-0025 IT WAS THEREFORE OBVIOUS ENOUGH TO WILLIAM AND THE MORE INTELLIGENT SLAVES THAT THE AUCTION BLOCK WAS NEAR AT HAND THE TRADER THE SLAVE PEN THE AUCTION BLOCK THE COFFLE GANG THE RICE SWAMP THE COTTON PLANTATION
8183-282977-0026 BLOODHOUNDS AND CRUEL OVERSEERS LOOMED UP BEFORE HIM AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE WITHOUT STOPPING TO CONSIDER THE DANGER HE IMMEDIATELY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD MAKE A STRUGGLE COST WHAT IT MIGHT
8183-282977-0027 HE WAS SHREWD ENOUGH TO FIND AN AGENT WHO GAVE HIM PRIVATE INSTRUCTIONS AND TO WHOM HE INDICATED A DESIRE TO TRAVEL NORTH ON SAID ROAD ON EXAMINATION HE WAS DEEMED RELIABLE
8183-282977-0028 HIS FAMILY WERE SLAVES AND BORE THE FOLLOWING NAMES HIS WIFE NANCY AND CHILDREN SIMON HENRY WILLIAM SARAH MARY ANN ELIZABETH LOUIS AND CORNELIUS
8183-282977-0029 IT WAS NO LIGHT MATTER TO BID THEM FAREWELL FOREVER THE SEPARATION FROM THEM WAS A TRIAL SUCH AS RARELY FALLS TO THE LOT OF MORTALS BUT HE NERVED HIMSELF FOR THE UNDERTAKING AND WHEN THE HOUR ARRIVED
8183-282977-0030 HIS STRENGTH WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE OCCASION THUS IN COMPANY WITH ANDREW THEY EMBARKED FOR AN UNKNOWN SHORE THEIR ENTIRE INTERESTS ENTRUSTED TO A STRANGER WHO WAS TO BRING THEM THROUGH DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS SEEN AND UNSEEN
8183-282977-0031 HE HAD SERVED ON THE FARM AS A COMMON FARM LABORER
8183-282977-0032 TO USE HIS OWN LANGUAGE THE FEAR OF WHAT AWAITED THE SLAVES PROMPTED ANDREW TO ESCAPE HE TOO WAS ENTANGLED WITH A WIFE AND ONE CHILD WITH WHOM HE PARTED ONLY AS A FRIEND PARTS WITH A COMPANION WHEN DEATH SEPARATES THEM
