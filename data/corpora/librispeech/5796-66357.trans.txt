5796-66357-0000 THE WEDDIN BY JENNIE BETTS HARTSWICK WELL IT'S OVER IT'S ALL OVER BEIN THE LAST TO LEAVE I KNOW THAT AND I DECLARE I'M THAT
5796-66357-0001 HOW DID I GET TWO OF EM WHY IT JUST
5796-66357-0002 AND WHEN I CAME DOWNSTAIRS I FOUND I'D CLEAN FORGOT WHERE I'D LAID THAT BOX OF CAKE I HUNTED
5796-66357-0003 OTHER ONE JUST AS INNOCENT ON THE HATRACK STAND WHERE I HAD LAID IT SO NOW I HAVE THREE OF EM COUNTIN JOHN'S I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO REALIZE THAT ELEANOR JAMISON IS MARRIED AT LAST CAN YOU
5796-66357-0004 SHE TOOK HER TIME IF EVER ANYBODY DID THEY
5796-66357-0005 ELEANOR'S GONE OFF A GOOD DEAL LATELY DON'T YOU THINK SO YOU HADN'T NOTICED
5796-66357-0006 BUT THEN YOU NEVER WAS ANY GREAT HAND AT NOTICIN I'VE NOTICED YOU WEREN'T WHY THE OTHER DAY WHEN I WAS THERE OFFERIN TO HELP EM GET READY FOR THE WEDDIN I NOTICED THAT SHE LOOKED REAL WORN
5796-66357-0007 BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT LINES IS A FORERUNNER HER HAIR'S BEGINNIN TO TURN TOO I NOTICED THAT COMIN OUT OF CHURCH LAST SUNDAY I DARE SAY HER KNOWING THIS MADE HER LESS PARTICULAR THAN SHE'D ONCE HAVE BEEN AND AFTER ALL MARRYIN ANY HUSBAND IS A GOOD DEAL LIKE BUYIN A NEW BLACK SILK DRESS PATTERN
5796-66357-0008 AN AWFUL RISK YOU MAY LOOK AT IT ON BOTH SIDES AND HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT AND PULL IT TO SEE IF IT'LL FRAY AND TRY IF IT'LL SPOT BUT YOU CAN'T BE SURE WHAT IT'LL DO TILL AFTER YOU'VE WORN IT A SPELL
5796-66357-0009 THERE'S ONE ADVANTAGE TO THE DRESS PATTERN THOUGH YOU CAN MAKE EM TAKE IT BACK IF YOU MISTRUST IT WON'T WEAR IF YOU HAVEN'T CUT INTO IT THAT IS BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT A HUSBAND WHY YOU'VE GOT HIM TO HAVE AND TO HOLD FOR BETTER AND WORSE AND GOOD AND ALL
5796-66357-0010 THIRTY YEARS AND I'D JUST HAVE GONE ANYWAY FOR I KNEW IT WAS A MISTAKE BUT JOHN HELD OUT THAT TWASN'T THAT THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO HAVE US TO THE HOUSE PART SO TO SETTLE IT I WENT RIGHT OVER AND TOLD EM
5796-66357-0011 I TOLD ELEANOR SHE MUSTN'T FEEL PUT OUT ABOUT IT WE WAS ALL MORTAL AND IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR SATISFYIN JOHN I'D NEVER HAVE LET HER KNOW HOW CARELESS SHE'D BEEN OF COURSE I'D MADE ALLOWANCE A WEDDIN IS UPSETTIN TO THE INTELLECT AND SO TWAS ALL RIGHT
5796-66357-0012 I HAD A REAL GOOD VIEW OF THE CEREMONY BUT TWASN'T THEIR FAULT THAT I HAD IT JUST HAPPENED THAT WAY WHEN JOHN
5796-66357-0013 BUT HE SAID THAT ALL THE FRONT PLACES WAS RESERVED FOR THE RELATIONS OF THE BRIDE AND GROOM AND THEN I NOTICED THAT THEY'D TIED OFF THE MIDDLE AISLE ABOUT SEVEN PEWS BACK WITH WHITE SATIN RIBBONS AND
5796-66357-0014 IT SEEMED REAL IMPOLITE TO INVITE FOLKS TO A WEDDIN AND THEN TAKE THE BEST SEATS THEMSELVES WELL JUST THEN I HAPPENED TO FEEL MY SHOELACIN GETTIN LOOSE AND I STEPPED TO ONE SIDE TO FIX IT AND WHEN I GOT UP FROM STOOPIN
5796-66357-0015 AND MY GLOVES ON AND BUTTONED I HAD TO TAKE EM OFF TO TIE MY SHOE AND STRAIGHTENED JOHN'S CRAVAT FOR HIM WHY
5796-66357-0016 AND WHEN WE CAME UP TO THE RIBBONS
5796-66357-0017 AND WE ALL WALKED THROUGH AND TOOK SEATS I MADE JOHN GO INTO THE PEW AHEAD OF ME SO'S I COULD GET OUT WITHOUT DISTURBIN ANYBODY IF I SHOULD HAVE A HEADACHE OR FEEL FAINT WHEN JOHN
5796-66357-0018 DO SIT STILL I HEAR THE BRIDAL PARTY COMIN
5796-66357-0019 PRETTY NEAR THE WHOLE OF WRENVILLE WAS THERE AND I MUST SAY THE CHURCH WAS A CREDIT TO THE WRENVILLE DRESSMAKERS I COULD PICK OUT ALL THEIR DIFFERENT FITS WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE THERE WAS ARABELLA SATTERLEE'S
5796-66357-0020 SHE SHAPES HER BACKS LIKE THE TOP OF A COFFIN OR SOMETIMES THEY REMIND ME MORE OF A KITE
5796-66357-0021 YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL HERS BY THE WAY THE ARMHOLES DRAW SHE MAKES THE MINISTER'S WIFE'S BUT THEY'D
5796-66357-0022 WELL WHEN THE ORGAN
5796-66357-0023 I WHISPERED TO JOHN THAT THEY LOOKED MORE AS IF ELEANOR WAS GOIN TO GIVE HER PA AWAY THAN HIM HER ELEANOR'S DRESS WAS ELEGANT ONLY AWFUL PLAIN IT WAS MADE IN NEW YORK AT GREENLEAF'S
5796-66357-0024 WELL WHEN THEY WAS ALL PAST I KEPT LOOKIN ROUND ME FOR THE GROOM AND WONDERIN HOW I HAD COME TO MISS HIM WHEN ALL AT ONCE JOHN NUDGED ME AND THERE HE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AND THE MINISTER BEGINNIN TO MARRY EM
