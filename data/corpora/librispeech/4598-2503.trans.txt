4598-2503-0000 HURRY ANITA I FEARED THAT POTAN MIGHT COME UP FROM THE HULL AT ANY MOMENT AND STOP US THE DUTY MAN OVER US GAZED DOWN HIS HUGE HEAD AND SHOULDERS BLOCKING THE SMALL SIGNAL ROOM WINDOW BROTOW CALLED UP IN MARTIAN
4598-2503-0001 TELLING HIM TO LET US COME HE SCOWLED BUT WHEN WE REACHED THE TRAP IN THE ROOM FLOOR GRID WE FOUND HIM STANDING ASIDE TO ADMIT US I FLUNG A SWIFT GLANCE AROUND IT WAS A METALLIC CUBBY NOT MUCH OVER FIFTEEN FEET SQUARE
4598-2503-0002 WITH AN EIGHT FOOT ARCHED CEILING THERE WERE INSTRUMENT PANELS THE RANGE FINDER FOR THE GIANT PROJECTOR WAS HERE ITS TELESCOPE WITH THE TRAJECTORY APPARATUS AND THE FIRING SWITCH WERE UNMISTAKABLE AND THE SIGNALING APPARATUS WAS HERE
4598-2503-0003 NOT A MARTIAN SET BUT A FULLY POWERFUL BOTZ ULTRA VIOLET SENDER WITH ITS ATTENDANT RECEIVING MIRRORS THE PLANETARA HAD USED THE BOTZ SYSTEM SO I WAS THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH IT I SAW TOO WHAT SEEMED TO BE WEAPONS
4598-2503-0004 A ROW OF SMALL FRAGILE GLASS GLOBES HANGING ON CLIPS ALONG THE WALL BOMBS EACH THE SIZE OF A MAN'S FIST AND A BROAD BELT WITH BOMBS IN ITS PADDED COMPARTMENTS MY HEART WAS POUNDING AS MY FIRST QUICK GLANCE TOOK IN THESE DETAILS
4598-2503-0005 I SAW ALSO THAT THE ROOM HAD FOUR SMALL OVAL WINDOW OPENINGS THEY WERE BREAST HIGH ABOVE THE FLOOR FROM THE DECK BELOW I KNEW THAT THE ANGLE OF VISION WAS SUCH THAT THE MEN DOWN THERE COULD NOT SEE INTO THIS ROOM EXCEPT TO GLIMPSE ITS UPPER PORTION NEAR THE CEILING
4598-2503-0006 AND THE HELIO SET WAS BANKED ON A LOW TABLE NEAR THE FLOOR IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM A SMALL LADDER LED THROUGH A CEILING TRAP TO THE CUBBY ROOF THIS UPPER TRAP WAS OPEN FOUR FEET ABOVE THE ROOM'S ROOF WAS THE ARCH OF THE DOME
4598-2503-0007 WITH THE ENTRANCE TO THE EXIT LOCK DIRECTLY ABOVE US THE WEAPONS AND THE BELT OF BOMBS WERE NEAR THE ASCENDING LADDER EVIDENTLY PLACED HERE AS EQUIPMENT FOR USE FROM THE TOP OF THE DOME I TURNED TO THE SOLITARY DUTY MAN
4598-2503-0008 I MUST GAIN HIS CONFIDENCE AT ONCE ANITA HAD LAID HER HELMET ASIDE SHE SPOKE FIRST
4598-2503-0009 IN THE WRECK OF THE PLANETARA YOU HEARD OF IT WE KNOW WHERE THE TREASURE IS THIS DUTY MAN WAS A FULL SEVEN FEET TALL AND THE MOST HEAVY SET MARTIAN I HAD EVER SEEN A TREMENDOUS BEETLE BROWED SCOWLING FELLOW HE STOOD WITH HANDS ON HIS HIPS
4598-2503-0010 HIS LEATHER GARBED LEGS SPREAD WIDE AND AS I CONFRONTED HIM I FELT LIKE A CHILD HE WAS SILENT GLARING DOWN AT ME AS I DREW HIS ATTENTION FROM ANITA YOU SPEAK ENGLISH I ASKED WE ARE NOT SKILLED WITH MARTIAN
4598-2503-0011 I WONDERED IF AT THE NEXT TIME OF SLEEP THIS FELLOW WOULD BE ON DUTY HERE I HOPED NOT IT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO TRICK HIM AND FIND AN OPPORTUNITY TO FLASH A SIGNAL BUT THAT TASK WAS SOME HOURS AWAY AS YET I WOULD WORRY ABOUT IT WHEN THE TIME CAME
4598-2503-0012 WHO AT ANY MOMENT MIGHT ARRIVE IN SIGHT IF WE COULD PERSUADE THIS DUTY MAN TO TURN THE PROJECTOR ON THEM HE ANSWERED ME IN READY ENGLISH YOU ARE THE MAN GREGG HALJAN AND THIS IS THE SISTER OF GEORGE PRINCE
4598-2503-0013 I AM A NAVIGATOR BROTOW WANTS ME TO PILOT THE SHIP WHEN WE ADVANCE TO ATTACK GRANTLINE THIS IS NOT THE CONTROL ROOM NO I KNOW IT ISN'T I PUT MY HELMET CAREFULLY ON THE FLOOR BESIDE ANITA'S
4598-2503-0014 I STRAIGHTENED TO FIND THE BRIGAND GAZING AT HER HE DID NOT SPEAK HE WAS STILL SCOWLING BUT IN THE DIM BLUE GLOW OF THE CUBBY I CAUGHT THE LOOK IN HIS EYES I SAID HASTILY GRANTLINE KNOWS YOUR SHIP HAS LANDED HERE ON ARCHIMEDES
4598-2503-0015 HE SENT UP A SIGNAL YOU SAW IT DIDN'T YOU JUST BEFORE MISS PRINCE AND I CAME ABOARD HE WAS TRYING TO PRETEND HE WAS YOUR EARTH PARTY MIKO AND CONISTON WHY THE FELLOW TURNED HIS SCOWL ON ME
4598-2503-0016 BUT ANITA BROUGHT HIS GAZE BACK TO HER SHE PUT IN QUICKLY GRANTLINE AS BROTHER ALWAYS SAID HAS NO GREAT CUNNING I BELIEVE NOW HE PLANS TO CREEP UP ON US UNAWARES
4598-2503-0017 IF HE DOES THAT I SAID WE WILL TURN THIS ELECTRONIC PROJECTOR ON HIM AND HIS PARTY AND ANNIHILATE THEM YOU HAVE ITS FIRING MECHANISM HERE WHO TOLD YOU SO HE SHOT AT ME I GESTURED I SEE IT HERE
4598-2503-0018 IT'S OBVIOUS I'M SKILLED AT TRAJECTORY FIRING IF GRANTLINE APPEARS DOWN THERE NOW I'LL HELP YOU IS IT CONNECTED ANITA DEMANDED BOLDLY YES HE SAID YOU HAVE ON YOUR ERENTZ SUITS ARE YOU GOING TO THE DOME ROOF THEN GO
4598-2503-0019 BUT THAT WAS WHAT WE DID NOT WANT TO DO ANITA'S GLANCE SEEMED TO TELL ME TO LET HER HANDLE THIS I TURNED TOWARD ONE OF THE CUBBY WINDOWS SHE SAID SWEETLY ARE YOU IN CHARGE OF THIS ROOM SHOW ME HOW THE PROJECTOR IS OPERATED
4598-2503-0020 I HAD MY BACK TO THEM FOR A MOMENT THROUGH THE BREAST HIGH OVAL I COULD SEE DOWN ACROSS THE DECK SPACE AND OUT THROUGH THE SIDE DOME WINDOWS AND MY HEART SUDDENLY LEAPED INTO MY THROAT IT SEEMED THAT DOWN THERE IN THE EARTHLIT SHADOWS
4598-2503-0021 WHERE THE SPREADING BASE OF THE GIANT CRATER JOINED THE PLAINS A LIGHT WAS BOBBING I GAZED STRICKEN MIKO'S LIGHTS WAS HE ADVANCING PREPARING TO SIGNAL I TRIED TO GAUGE THE DISTANCE IT WAS NOT OVER TWO MILES FROM HERE
4598-2503-0022 OR WAS IT NOT A LIGHT AT ALL WITH THE NAKED EYE I COULD NOT BE SURE PERHAPS THERE WAS A TELESCOPE FINDER HERE IN THE CUBBY I WAS SUBCONSCIOUSLY AWARE OF THE VOICES OF ANITA AND THE DUTY MAN BEHIND ME
4598-2503-0023 THEN ABRUPTLY I HEARD ANITA'S LOW CRY I WHIRLED AROUND THE GIANT MARTIAN HAD GATHERED HER INTO HIS HUGE ARMS HIS HEAVY JOWLED GRAY FACE WITH A LEERING GRIN CLOSE TO HERS HE SAW ME COMING
4598-2503-0024 HE HELD HER WITH ONE ARM HIS OTHER FLUNG AT ME CAUGHT ME KNOCKED ME BACKWARD HE RASPED GET OUT OF HERE GO UP TO THE DOME ANITA WAS SILENTLY STRUGGLING WITH HER LITTLE HANDS AT HIS THICK THROAT
4598-2503-0025 BUT I HELD MY FEET I WAS PARTLY BEHIND HIM I LEAPED AGAIN AND AS HE TRIED TO DISENGAGE HIMSELF FROM ANITA TO FRONT ME HER CLUTCHING FINGERS IMPEDED HIM MY PROJECTOR WAS IN MY HAND
4598-2503-0026 BUT IN THAT SECOND AS I LEAPED I HAD THE SENSE TO REALIZE I SHOULD NOT FIRE IT BECAUSE ITS NOISE WOULD ALARM THE SHIP I GRASPED ITS BARREL REACHED UPWARD AND STRUCK WITH ITS HEAVY METAL BUTT THE BLOW CAUGHT THE MARTIAN ON THE SKULL
4598-2503-0027 AND SIMULTANEOUSLY MY BODY STRUCK HIM WE WENT DOWN TOGETHER FALLING PARTLY UPON ANITA
4598-2503-0028 I LAY PANTING ANITA SQUIRMED SILENTLY FROM UNDER US BLOOD FROM THE GIANT'S HEAD WAS WELLING OUT HOT AND STICKY AGAINST MY FACE AS I LAY SPRAWLED ON HIM I CAST HIM OFF HE WAS DEAD
4598-2503-0029 HIS FRAGILE MARTIAN SKULL SPLIT OPEN BY MY BLOW THERE HAD BEEN NO ALARM THE SLIGHT NOISE WE MADE HAD NOT BEEN HEARD DOWN ON THE BUSY DECK ANITA AND I CROUCHED BY THE FLOOR FROM THE DECK ALL THIS PART OF THE ROOM COULD NOT BE SEEN
4598-2503-0030 DEAD OH GREGG IT FORCED OUR HAND
4598-2503-0031 BUT I COULD FLASH THE EARTH SIGNAL NOW AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE OUR RUN TO ESCAPE THEN I REMEMBERED THAT LIGHT DOWN BY THE BASE I KEPT ANITA OUT OF SIGHT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND WENT CAUTIOUSLY TO A WINDOW THE DECK WAS IN TURMOIL WITH BRIGANDS MOVING ABOUT EXCITEDLY
4598-2503-0032 NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN OUR TOWER SIGNAL ROOM THEY WERE UNAWARE OF THAT MIKO'S SIGNALS WERE SHOWING I COULD SEE THEM NOW PLAINLY DOWN AT THE CRATER BASE A GROUP OF HAND LIGHTS AND SMALL WAVING HELIO BEAM
4598-2503-0033 AND THEY WERE BEING ANSWERED FROM THE SHIP POTAN WAS ON THE DECK A BABBLE OF VOICES ABOVE WHICH HIS ROSE WITH ROARS OF COMMAND AT ONE OF THE DOME WINDOWS A BRIGAND WITH A HAND SEARCHBEAM WAS SENDING ITS ANSWERING LIGHT
4598-2503-0034 AND I SAW THAT POTAN WAS WORKING OVER A DECK TELESCOPE FINDER IT HAD ALL COME SO SUDDENLY THAT I WAS STUNNED BUT I DID NOT WAIT TO READ THE SIGNALS I SWUNG BACK AT ANITA WHO STARED HELPLESSLY AT ME
4598-2503-0035 IT'S MIKO AND THEY ARE ANSWERING HIM GET YOUR HELMET I'LL TRY FIRING THE PROJECTOR OR WOULD I INSTEAD TRY AND SEND A BRIEF FLASH SIGNAL TO EARTH THERE WOULD BE NO TIME TO DO BOTH WE MUST ESCAPE OUT OF HERE
4598-2503-0036 THE ROUTE UP THROUGH THE DOME WAS THE ONLY FEASIBLE ONE NOW THIS RANGE MECHANISM OF THE PROJECTOR WAS REASONABLY FAMILIAR AND I FELT THAT I COULD OPERATE IT THE RANGE FINDER AND THE SWITCH WERE ON A LEDGE AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS I RUSHED TO IT
4598-2503-0037 AS I SWUNG THE TELESCOPE TRAINING IT DOWN ON MIKO'S LIGHTS I COULD SEE THE HUGE PROJECTOR ON THE DECK SWINGING SIMILARLY ITS MOVEMENT SURPRISED THE MEN WHO WERE ATTENDING IT ONE OF THEM CALLED UP TO ME BUT I IGNORED HIM
4598-2503-0038 THEN POTAN LOOKED UP AND SAW ME HE SHOUTED IN MARTIAN AT THE DUTY MAN WHOM HE DOUBTLESS THOUGHT WAS BEHIND ME BE READY WE MAY FIRE ON THEM I'LL GIVE YOU THE WORD THE SIGNALS WERE PROCEEDING IT HAD ONLY BEEN A MOMENT
4598-2503-0039 I CAUGHT SOMETHING LIKE HALJAN IS IMPOSTER I WAS AIMING THE PROJECTOR I WAS AWARE OF ANITA AT MY ELBOW I PUSHED HER BACK PUT ON YOUR HELMET I HAD THE RANGE I FLUNG THE FIRING SWITCH
4598-2503-0040 AT THE DECK WINDOW THE GIANT PROJECTOR SPAT ITS DEADLY ELECTRONIC STREAM THE MEN DOWN THERE LEAPED AWAY FROM IT IN SURPRISE I HEARD POTAN'S VOICE HIS SHOUT OF PROTEST AND ANGER BUT DOWN IN THE EARTH GLOW AT THE CRATER BASE
4598-2503-0041 MIKO'S LIGHTS HAD NOT VANISHED I HAD MISSED AN ERROR IN THE RANGE ABRUPTLY I KNEW IT WAS NOT THAT MIKO'S LIGHTS WERE STILL THERE HIS SIGNALS STILL COMING AND I NOTICED NOW A FAINT DISTORTION ABOUT THEM
4598-2503-0042 THE GLOW OF HIS LITTLE GROUP OF HAND LIGHTS FAINTLY DISTORTED AND VAGUELY SHOT WITH A GREENISH CAST BENSON CURVE LIGHTS MY THOUGHTS WHIRLED IN THE FEW SECONDS WHILE I STOOD THERE AT THE TOWER WINDOW
4598-2503-0043 HE HAD GONE BACK TO HIS CAMP EQUIPPED ALL HIS LIGHTS WITH THE BENSON CURVE HE WAS SOMEWHERE AT THE CRATER BASE NOW BUT NOT WHERE I THOUGHT I SAW HIM THE BENSON CURVE LIGHT CHANGED THE PATH OF THE LIGHT RAYS TRAVELING FROM HIM TO ME
4598-2503-0044 I COULD NOT EVEN APPROXIMATE HIS TRUE POSITION ANITA WAS PLUCKING AT ME GREGG COME I CAN'T HIT HIM I GASPED SHOULD I TRY THE FLASH SIGNAL TO EARTH DID WE DARE LINGER HERE
4598-2503-0045 I STOOD ANOTHER FEW SECONDS AT THE WINDOW I SAW POTAN DOWN IN THE CONFUSION OF THE DECK TRAINING A TELESCOPE HE HAD SHOUTED UP VIOLENTLY AT HIS DUTY MAN HERE NOT TO FIRE AGAIN AND NOW HE LET OUT A ROAR I CAN SEE THEM
4598-2503-0046 BY THE ALMIGHTY HIS GIANT STATURE BROTOW LOOK THAT'S NOT AN EARTH MAN HE FLUNG ASIDE HIS TELESCOPE FINDER DISCONNECT THAT PROJECTOR
4598-2503-0047 THIS HALJAN IS A TRICKSTER WHERE IS HE
4598-2503-0048 ARE HALJAN AND THE GIRL UP THERE WITH YOU BUT THE DUTY MAN LAY IN HIS BLOOD AT OUR FEET I HAD DROPPED BACK FROM THE WINDOW ANITA AND I CROUCHED FOR AN INSTANT IN CONFUSION FUMBLING WITH OUR HELMETS
