6364-66741-0000 BUT RATHER AS BELONGING TO IT IN THE ASPECT OF THE CROWNING GRACE OF ALL THE REST THAT PRINCIPLE I MEAN TO WHICH POLITY OWES ITS STABILITY LIFE ITS HAPPINESS FAITH ITS ACCEPTANCE CREATION ITS CONTINUANCE
6364-66741-0001 THE STARS HAVE IT NOT THE EARTH HAS IT NOT THE SEA HAS IT NOT AND WE MEN HAVE THE MOCKERY AND SEMBLANCE OF IT ONLY FOR OUR HEAVIEST PUNISHMENT
6364-66741-0002 HE HAD SEEN AMONG MEN IN ITS TRUE DYES OF DARKNESS BUT WITH WHAT STRANGE FALLACY OF INTERPRETATION SINCE IN ONE NOBLE LINE OF HIS INVOCATION HE HAS CONTRADICTED THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE REST
6364-66741-0003 AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE PRESENCE OF A SUBJECTION SURELY NOT LESS SEVERE BECAUSE ETERNAL HOW COULD HE OTHERWISE SINCE IF THERE BE ANY ONE PRINCIPLE MORE WIDELY THAN ANOTHER CONFESSED BY EVERY UTTERANCE
6364-66741-0004 OR MORE STERNLY THAN ANOTHER IMPRINTED ON EVERY ATOM OF THE VISIBLE CREATION THAT PRINCIPLE IS NOT LIBERTY BUT LAW TWO
6364-66741-0005 SUBJECTION OF THE WILL IF YOU MEAN THE FEAR OF INFLICTING THE SHAME OF COMMITTING A WRONG IF YOU MEAN RESPECT FOR ALL WHO ARE IN AUTHORITY AND CONSIDERATION FOR ALL WHO ARE IN DEPENDENCE VENERATION FOR THE GOOD
6364-66741-0006 AND THE FOOL EQUALITY
6364-66741-0007 AND THE MALIGNANT MEAN VIOLENCE CALL IT BY ANY NAME RATHER THAN THIS BUT ITS BEST AND TRUEST IS OBEDIENCE OBEDIENCE IS INDEED FOUNDED ON A KIND OF FREEDOM ELSE ITS WOULD BECOME MERE SUBJUGATION
6364-66741-0008 BUT THAT FREEDOM IS ONLY GRANTED THAT OBEDIENCE MAY BE MORE PERFECT AND THUS WHILE A MEASURE OF LICENSE IS NECESSARY TO EXHIBIT THE INDIVIDUAL ENERGIES OF THINGS THE FAIRNESS AND PLEASANTNESS AND PERFECTION OF THEM ALL
6364-66741-0009 CONSIST IN THEIR RESTRAINT COMPARE A RIVER THAT HAS BURST ITS BANKS WITH ONE THAT IS BOUND BY THEM AND THE CLOUDS THAT ARE SCATTERED OVER THE FACE OF THE WHOLE HEAVEN
6364-66741-0010 WITH THOSE THAT ARE MARSHALLED INTO RANKS AND ORDERS BY ITS WINDS SO THAT THOUGH RESTRAINT UTTER AND UNRELAXING CAN NEVER BE COMELY THIS IS NOT BECAUSE IT IS IN ITSELF AN EVIL
6364-66741-0011 IS BETWEEN THE LAWS OF LIFE AND BEING IN THE THINGS GOVERNED AND THE LAWS OF GENERAL SWAY TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECTED AND THE SUSPENSION OR INFRINGEMENT OF EITHER KIND OF LAW OR LITERALLY DISORDER IS EQUIVALENT TO
6364-66741-0012 AND SYNONYMOUS WITH DISEASE WHILE THE INCREASE OF BOTH HONOR AND BEAUTY IS HABITUALLY ON THE SIDE OF RESTRAINT OR THE ACTION OF SUPERIOR LAW RATHER THAN OF CHARACTER OR THE ACTION OF INHERENT LAW
6364-66741-0013 BUT WE MAY OBSERVE THAT EXACTLY IN PROPORTION TO THE MAJESTY OF THINGS IN THE SCALE OF BEING IS THE COMPLETENESS OF THEIR OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWS THAT ARE SET OVER THEM GRAVITATION IS LESS QUIETLY LESS INSTANTLY OBEYED BY A GRAIN OF DUST
6364-66741-0014 THAN IT IS BY THE SUN AND MOON AND THE OCEAN FALLS AND FLOWS UNDER INFLUENCES WHICH THE LAKE AND RIVER DO NOT RECOGNIZE SO ALSO IN ESTIMATING THE DIGNITY OF ANY ACTION OR OCCUPATION OF MEN
6364-66741-0015 THIS SEVERITY MUST BE SINGULAR THEREFORE IN THE CASE OF THAT ART ABOVE ALL OTHERS WHOSE PRODUCTIONS ARE THE MOST VAST AND THE MOST COMMON WHICH REQUIRES FOR ITS PRACTICE THE CO OPERATION OF BODIES OF MEN
6364-66741-0016 THAT THE LICENSE WHICH THEY EXTEND TO THE WORKINGS OF INDIVIDUAL MIND WOULD BE WITHDRAWN BY HER AND THAT IN ASSERTION OF THE RELATIONS WHICH SHE HOLDS WITH ALL THAT IS UNIVERSALLY IMPORTANT TO MAN
6364-66741-0017 SHE WOULD SET FORTH BY HER OWN MAJESTIC SUBJECTION SOME LIKENESS OF THAT ON WHICH MAN'S SOCIAL HAPPINESS AND POWER DEPEND WE MIGHT THEREFORE WITHOUT THE LIGHT OF EXPERIENCE CONCLUDE THAT ARCHITECTURE NEVER COULD FLOURISH
6364-66741-0018 IF THERE BE ANY ONE CONDITION WHICH IN WATCHING THE PROGRESS OF ARCHITECTURE WE SEE DISTINCT AND GENERAL IF AMIDST THE COUNTER EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS ATTENDING OPPOSITE ACCIDENTS OF CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCE
6364-66741-0019 ANY ONE CONCLUSION MAY BE CONSTANTLY AND INDISPUTABLY DRAWN IT IS THIS THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF A NATION IS GREAT ONLY WHEN IT IS AS UNIVERSAL AND AS ESTABLISHED AS ITS LANGUAGE AND WHEN PROVINCIAL DIFFERENCES OF STYLE
6364-66741-0020 ARE NOTHING MORE THAN SO MANY DIALECTS OTHER NECESSITIES ARE MATTERS OF DOUBT NATIONS HAVE BEEN ALIKE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR ARCHITECTURE IN TIMES OF POVERTY AND OF WEALTH IN TIMES OF WAR AND OF PEACE IN TIMES OF BARBARISM
6364-66741-0021 AND OF REFINEMENT UNDER GOVERNMENTS THE MOST LIBERAL OR THE MOST ARBITRARY BUT THIS ONE CONDITION HAS BEEN CONSTANT THIS ONE REQUIREMENT CLEAR IN ALL PLACES AND AT ALL TIMES
6364-66741-0022 THAT THE WORK SHALL BE THAT OF A SCHOOL THAT NO INDIVIDUAL CAPRICE SHALL DISPENSE WITH OR MATERIALLY VARY ACCEPTED TYPES AND CUSTOMARY DECORATIONS AND THAT FROM THE COTTAGE TO THE PALACE
6364-66741-0023 AND FROM THE CHAPEL TO THE BASILICA AND FROM THE GARDEN FENCE TO THE FORTRESS WALL EVERY MEMBER AND FEATURE OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE NATION SHALL BE AS COMMONLY CURRENT AS FRANKLY ACCEPTED AS ITS LANGUAGE OR ITS COIN
6364-66741-0024 AS TO ASK OF A MAN WHO HAS NEVER HAD RAGS ENOUGH ON HIS BACK TO KEEP OUT COLD TO INVENT A NEW MODE OF CUTTING A COAT GIVE HIM A WHOLE COAT FIRST AND LET HIM CONCERN HIMSELF ABOUT THE FASHION OF IT AFTERWARDS
6364-66741-0025 WE WANT NO NEW STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE WHO WANTS A NEW STYLE OF PAINTING OR SCULPTURE BUT WE WANT SOME STYLE IT IS OF MARVELLOUSLY LITTLE IMPORTANCE IF WE HAVE A CODE OF LAWS AND THEY BE GOOD LAWS
6364-66741-0026 WHETHER THEY BE NEW OR OLD FOREIGN OR NATIVE ROMAN OR SAXON OR NORMAN OR ENGLISH LAWS BUT IT IS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A CODE OF LAWS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER
6364-66741-0027 AND THAT CODE ACCEPTED AND ENFORCED FROM ONE SIDE OF THE ISLAND TO ANOTHER AND NOT ONE LAW MADE GROUND OF JUDGMENT AT YORK
6364-66741-0028 AND IN LIKE MANNER IT DOES NOT MATTER ONE MARBLE SPLINTER WHETHER WE HAVE AN OLD OR NEW ARCHITECTURE BUT IT MATTERS EVERYTHING WHETHER WE HAVE AN ARCHITECTURE TRULY SO CALLED OR NOT THAT IS
6364-66741-0029 WHETHER AN ARCHITECTURE WHOSE LAWS MIGHT BE TAUGHT AT OUR SCHOOLS FROM CORNWALL TO NORTHUMBERLAND AS WE TEACH ENGLISH SPELLING AND ENGLISH GRAMMAR OR AN ARCHITECTURE WHICH IS TO BE INVENTED FRESH EVERY TIME WE BUILD A WORKHOUSE
6364-66741-0030 ORIGINALITY IN EXPRESSION DOES NOT DEPEND ON INVENTION OF NEW WORDS NOR ORIGINALITY IN POETRY ON INVENTION OF NEW MEASURES NOR IN PAINTING ON INVENTION OF NEW COLORS OR NEW MODES OF USING THEM
6364-66741-0031 GRANTING THAT THEY MAY BE SUCH ADDITIONS OR ALTERATIONS ARE MUCH MORE THE WORK OF TIME AND OF MULTITUDES THAN OF INDIVIDUAL INVENTORS WE MAY HAVE ONE VAN EYCK WHO WILL BE KNOWN AS THE INTRODUCER OF A NEW STYLE ONCE IN TEN CENTURIES
6364-66741-0032 TO SOME ACCIDENTAL BYE PLAY OR PURSUIT AND THE USE OF THAT INVENTION WILL DEPEND ALTOGETHER ON THE POPULAR NECESSITIES OR INSTINCTS OF THE PERIOD ORIGINALITY DEPENDS ON NOTHING OF THE KIND A MAN WHO HAS THE GIFT
6364-66741-0033 I DO NOT SAY THAT HE WILL NOT TAKE LIBERTIES WITH HIS MATERIALS OR WITH HIS RULES I DO NOT SAY THAT STRANGE CHANGES WILL NOT SOMETIMES BE WROUGHT BY HIS EFFORTS OR HIS FANCIES IN BOTH BUT THOSE CHANGES WILL BE INSTRUCTIVE
6364-66741-0034 NATURAL FACILE THOUGH SOMETIMES MARVELLOUS THEY WILL NEVER BE SOUGHT AFTER AS THINGS NECESSARY TO HIS DIGNITY OR TO HIS INDEPENDENCE AND THOSE LIBERTIES WILL BE LIKE THE LIBERTIES THAT A GREAT SPEAKER TAKES WITH THE LANGUAGE
6364-66741-0035 AND THE INSECT AT THOSE PERIODS WHEN BY THEIR NATURAL PROGRESS AND CONSTITUTIONAL POWER SUCH CHANGES ARE ABOUT TO BE WROUGHT BUT AS THAT WOULD BE BOTH AN UNCOMFORTABLE AND FOOLISH CATERPILLAR WHICH INSTEAD OF BEING CONTENTED WITH A CATERPILLAR'S LIFE
6364-66741-0036 IS STRUGGLING AND FRETTING UNDER THE NATURAL LIMITATIONS OF ITS EXISTENCE AND STRIVING TO BECOME SOMETHING OTHER THAN IT IS AND THOUGH IT IS THE NOBILITY OF THE HIGHEST CREATURES TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND PARTLY TO UNDERSTAND THE CHANGES WHICH ARE APPOINTED FOR THEM
6364-66741-0037 PREPARING FOR THEM BEFOREHAND AND IF AS IS USUAL WITH APPOINTED CHANGES THEY BE INTO A HIGHER STATE EVEN DESIRING THEM AND REJOICING IN THE HOPE OF THEM
