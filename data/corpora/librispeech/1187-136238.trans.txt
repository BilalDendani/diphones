1187-136238-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE OUR FLIGHT AND HOW IT ENDED HOW CAME THIS LADY HERE MAYA AND WHAT DOES SHE SEEK THE SEOR ASKED I DO NOT KNOW HOW SHE CAME GASPED HIS WIFE
1187-136238-0001 WHEN LOOKING INTO YONDER MIRROR I SAW HER BEHIND ME HAVING IN HER HAND A NAKED KNIFE AND SEARCHING THE ROOM WITH HER EYES PRESENTLY THEY FELL UPON THE CRADLE AND LIFTING THE KNIFE SHE TOOK A STEP TOWARDS IT
1187-136238-0002 THEN I TURNED AND GRIPPED HER HOLDING HER AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE BUT SHE WAS TOO STRONG FOR ME
1187-136238-0003 IS THIS TRUE SAID THE SEOR TO NAHUA IT IS TRUE WHITE MAN SHE ANSWERED
1187-136238-0004 AMONGST MANY OTHER THINGS I HAVE LEARNED WHITE MAN
1187-136238-0005 WHEREAT MY HUSBAND IS TO BE DEPOSED AND MY CHILD DISHONOURED THAT THEY MAY MAKE ROOM FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR CHILD YOU THE WHITE WANDERER AND YOUR SON THE HEAVEN BORN THE FORE ORDAINED
1187-136238-0006 WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH THESE THINGS O WOMAN WITH THE HEART OF A PUMA HE ASKED IF TIKAL IS TO BE DRIVEN FROM HIS PLACE IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS CRIMES AND IF YOU AND YOURS ARE TO BE SET IN IT WHITE MAN
1187-136238-0007 WITHOUT DOUBT IT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR VIRTUES AND YET
1187-136238-0008 I KNOW HOW YOU FORGED THE WRITING SETTING THE FALSE FOR THE TRUE WITHIN THE HOLY SYMBOL OF THE HEART I KNOW ALSO THAT MY FATHER HELPED YOU TO THE DEED FOR ALTHOUGH HE IS DEAD HE WROTE DOWN THAT TALE BEFORE HE DIED
1187-136238-0009 AND GAVE IT TO ME TOGETHER WITH THE ANCIENT PROPHECY THAT YOU DARED TO STEAL FROM THE HOLY SANCTUARY YES I HAVE THE PROOFS AND WHEN NEEDFUL I WILL SHOW THEM I DID NOT COME HERE TO DO MURDER
1187-136238-0010 AT LEAST NOT UPON THE INFANT BUT THE SIGHT OF IT SLEEPING IN ITS CRADLE OVERCAME ME AND OF A SUDDEN I DETERMINED TO WREAK MY WRONGS UPON IT AND UPON ITS MOTHER
1187-136238-0011 IN THIS I HAVE FAILED BUT WHEN I DENOUNCE YOU TO THE COUNCIL THEN I SHALL NOT FAIL THEN YOU WILL BE KNOWN FOR WHAT YOU ARE AND DIE THE DEATH THAT YOU DESERVE
1187-136238-0012 IT COMES INTO MY MIND HUSBAND SAID MAYA COLDLY THAT IF WE WOULD SAVE OUR OWN LIVES WE MUST ROB THIS WOMAN OF HERS SUCH A DOOM SHE HAS RICHLY EARNED
1187-136238-0013 NOR WILL ANY BLAME US WHEN THEY LEARN WHAT WAS HER ERRAND HERE NOW WHEN SHE HEARD THESE WORDS NAHUA STRUGGLED IN THE SEOR'S GRASP
1187-136238-0014 IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR SOUL IN YOU IGNATIO CLOSE THOSE DOORS AND GIVE ME YONDER SHAWL I DID SO AND WITH THE SHAWL WE BOUND NAHUA'S ARMS BEHIND HER FASTENING IT OVER HER MOUTH SO THAT SHE COULD MAKE NO SOUND
1187-136238-0015 THEN WE TOOK A LEATHER GIRDLE AND STRAPPED IT ABOUT HER KNEES
1187-136238-0016 NOW LET US TAKE COUNSEL I SAID
1187-136238-0017 ONE OF TWO THINGS WE MUST DO KILL THAT WOMAN OR FLY THE CITY FOR IF SHE LEAVES THIS PLACE ALIVE WE ARE CERTAINLY DOOMED TO DEATH BEFORE THE ALTAR AY AND THE CHILD ALSO FLY SAID MAYA
1187-136238-0018 HOW CAN WE FLY WHEN I AM STILL WEAK AND THE BABE IS SO YOUNG AND TENDER SHOULD WE SUCCEED IN ESCAPING FROM THE CITY AND ACROSS THE LAKE CERTAINLY WE MUST PERISH AMONG THE SNOWS OF THE MOUNTAINS
1187-136238-0019 OR IN THE DESERTS BEYOND ALSO WE SHOULD BE MISSED AND OVERTAKEN
1187-136238-0020 AS EASILY MIGHT YOU SWEAR A SNAKE NOT TO USE ITS FANGS IF ONE SHOULD CHANCE TO TREAD ON IT
1187-136238-0021 THAT SHE WOULD GLADLY DIE HERSELF IF THEREBY SHE COULD BRING ABOUT MY DEATH AND THAT OF THOSE WHO ARE DEAR TO ME SO SOON AS SHE COULD LEAVE HER BED OF SICKNESS SHE CAME HERE TO TAUNT ME
1187-136238-0022 WITH THE DOOM SHE HAD PREPARED KNOWING THAT I WAS ALONE THEN SHE SAW THE CHILD AND SO GREAT WAS HER DESIRE FOR REVENGE THAT SHE COULD NOT EVEN WAIT TILL THE LAW SHOULD WREAK IT FOR HER NO THE ISSUE IS PLAIN
1187-136238-0023 IF WE CANNOT FLY EITHER SHE MUST DIE OR WE MUST IS IT NOT SO IGNATIO IT SEEMS THAT IT IS SO I ANSWERED SADLY AND YET THE THING IS AWFUL
1187-136238-0024 AND IT FALLS ON ME TO DO IT FOR THE SAKE OF MY WIFE AND CHILD ALAS THAT I WAS EVER BORN THAT I SHOULD LIVE TO STAND FACE TO FACE WITH SUCH NECESSITY COULD NOT ANOTHER HAND BE FOUND NO
1187-136238-0025 I SEIZED HER AND KILLED HER SUDDENLY BY MY STRENGTH ALONE NOT MEANING IT IN MY WRATH NOW HE STEPPED TO WHERE NAHUA LAY AND KNELT BESIDE HER AND WE TWO DREW AWAY SICK AT HEART AND HID OUR FACES IN OUR HANDS
1187-136238-0026 PRESENTLY HE WAS WITH US AGAIN IS IT DONE ASKED MAYA HOARSELY NO
1187-136238-0027 WHAT THEN IS TO BE DONE WITH THIS WOMAN I ASKED WE CANNOT TAKE HER WITH US NO BUT WE CAN LEAVE HER
1187-136238-0028 HEARKEN NAHUA WE SPARE YOU AND TO DO IT GO FORTH TO OUR OWN DEATHS MAY YOUR FIERCE HEART LEARN A LESSON OF MERCY FROM THE DEED FAREWELL
1187-136238-0029 WHICH WAS USED AS A MOORING PLACE FOR BOATS DURING THE MONTHS OF INUNDATION AS WAS COMMON AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR THE LAKE WAS ALREADY RISING AND FLOATING IN THE SHALLOW WATER AT THE END OF THE JETTY LAY A PLEASURE SKIFF
1187-136238-0030 FOR A FEW HOURS FROM OUR WEARISOME LIFE IN THE CITY INTO THIS SKIFF WE ENTERED AND HAVING HOISTED THE SAIL SET OUR COURSE BY THE STARS
1187-136238-0031 FOR THE CITY OF THE HEART THE WIND BEING FAVOURABLE TO US OUR PROGRESS WAS RAPID AND BY THE FIRST GREY LIGHT OF DAWN WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE NOT A MILE AWAY HERE HOWEVER WE DID NOT DARE TO LAND
1187-136238-0032 FOR WE SHOULD BE SEEN AND RECOGNISED THEREFORE WE BEACHED OUR BOAT BEHIND THE SHELTER OF SOME DWARF WATER PALMS THREE FURLONGS OR MORE BELOW THE VILLAGE AND HAVING HIDDEN IT AS WELL AS WE WERE ABLE
1187-136238-0033 SET OUT AT ONCE TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS PASSING ROUND THE BACK OF THE VILLAGE WITHOUT BEING SEEN FOR AS YET FOLK WERE SCARCELY ASTIR WE BEGAN OUR DREADFUL JOURNEY FOR A WHILE MAYA BORE UP WELL
1187-136238-0034 BUT AS THE HEAT OF THE DAY INCREASED SHE SHOWED SIGNS OF TIRING WHICH WAS LITTLE TO BE WONDERED AT SEEING THAT SHE CARRIED IN HER ARMS A CHILD NOT THREE WEEKS OLD AT MID DAY WE HALTED THAT SHE MIGHT REST
1187-136238-0035 IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON WE STARTED ON AGAIN AND FOR THE REST OF
1187-136238-0036 AT LENGTH THE EVENING FELL AND WE CAMPED FOR THE NIGHT IF CAMPING IT CAN BE CALLED TO SLEEP BENEATH THE SHADOW OF A CEDAR TREE WITHOUT FIRE AND WITH LITTLE FOOD
1187-136238-0037 TOWARDS MORNING THE AIR GREW COLD FOR ALREADY WE WERE AT SOME HEIGHT ABOVE THE LAKE AND THE TENDER INFANT BEGAN TO WAIL PITEOUSLY A WAIL THAT WRUNG OUR HEARTS
1187-136238-0038 STILL WE ROSE WITH THE SUN AND WENT ON OUR WAY FOR IT SEEMED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO THROUGHOUT THAT DAY WITH EVER WEARYING FOOTSTEPS WE JOURNEYED TILL AT SUNSET WE REACHED THE SNOW LINE AND SAW BEFORE US
1187-136238-0039 THE HUNTER'S REST HOUSE WHERE WE HAD SLEPT WHEN FIRST WE ENTERED THE COUNTRY OF THE HEART LET US GO IN SAID MAYA AND FIND FOOD AND SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT
1187-136238-0040 NOW OUR PLAN HAD BEEN TO AVOID THIS HOUSE AND GAIN THE PASS WHERE WE PROPOSED TO STAY TILL DAYBREAK AND THEN TO TRAVEL DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES INTO THE WILDERNESS
1187-136238-0041 OUR ONLY SAFETY LIES IN TRAVELLING THROUGH THE PASS BEFORE WE ARE OVERTAKEN FOR IT IS AGAINST THE LAW THAT ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE SHOULD FOLLOW US INTO THE WILDERNESS IF WE DO NOT ENTER MY CHILD WILL DIE IN THE COLD SHE ANSWERED
