7315-104382-0011 AND WAS ALMOST IN THE SHADOW OF THE BIG CRUEL FACTORY WHEN THE MAGIC BEGAN TO WORK
7315-104382-0012 IT WAS ONLY WAITING FOR ERIC TO SEE IT BEFORE IT WOULD TAKE HOLD OF HIM AND CARRY HIM AWAY INTO HAPPINESS IT HAD WAITED FOR HIM AT THE DOOR OF THE DULL BARE LITTLE HOUSE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN HOME TO HIM
7315-104382-0013 AND HE DID FEEL JUST IN TIME TO LET THE MAGIC WORK
7315-104382-0014 STRANGELY WARM HE WIPED THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES AWAY TO THE SIDE OF HIS FACE WITH HIS SLEEVE AND LOOKED ABOUT THE SUN WAS VERY BRIGHT BUT IN A MILD PLEASANT WAY

7315-104382-0018 A WOOD HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN TOO TIRED TO THINK OF EXPLORING EVEN ON HOLIDAYS NOW HE SAW THE TOPS OF THE TALL TREES BECKONING HIM IN A GOLDEN MIST
7315-104382-0019 THAT WAS WHY THE GOLDEN LEAVES WERE SHOWERING IN A MIST AND WHY THE SUN WAS SO WARM ERIC DROPPED HIS RAGGED COAT AND CAP ON THE EDGE OF THE WOOD IT WAS SO WARM AND WENT IN
7315-104382-0020 A LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM FROM HER PLACE AT ONE OF THE FACTORY WINDOWS WHERE SHE WAS SORTING CANS
7315-104382-0021 HAD THEY SENT HIM PERHAPS TO DO A DIFFERENT KIND OF WORK THAT COULD ONLY BE DONE IN THE WOODS BUT AS HE WALKED AWAY IN UNDER THE TREES FARTHER AND FARTHER
7315-104382-0022 AND ALTHOUGH SHE LEANED FAR FORWARD OVER THE CANS AT A GREAT RISK OF KNOCKING OVER DOZENS AND SETTING THEM ROLLING
