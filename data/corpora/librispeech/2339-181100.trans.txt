2339-181100-0000 THERE WAS SOMETHING BEAUTIFULLY SINCERE AND REAL ABOUT AUNT HELEN SHE NEVER FUSSED OVER ANY ONE OR PRETENDED TO SYMPATHIZE JUST TO MAKE OUT HOW NICE SHE WAS SHE WAS REAL AND YOU FELT THAT NO MATTER WHAT WILD OR AWFUL RUBBISH YOU TALKED TO HER
2339-181100-0001 IT WOULD NEVER BE RETAILED FOR ANY ONE'S AMUSEMENT AND BETTER THAN ALL SHE NEVER LECTURED SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I IMPULSIVELY THREW MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND SOBBED FORTH MY TROUBLES IN A STRING
2339-181100-0002 SHE HEARD ME TO THE END AND THEN SAID QUIETLY
2339-181100-0003 I CONTROLLED MYSELF INSTANTLY AND WAITED EXPECTANTLY WHAT WOULD SHE SAY SURELY NOT THAT TAME OLD YARN ANENT THIS WORLD BEING MERELY A PLACE OF PROBATION WHEREIN WE WERE ALLOWED TIME TO FIT OURSELVES FOR A BEAUTIFUL WORLD TO COME
2339-181100-0004 THAT WAS ANOTHER PIECE OF OLD CROAKING OF THE JOB'S COMFORTER ORDER OF WHICH I WAS SICK UNTO DEATH
2339-181100-0005 I NEED NOT HAVE FEARED AUNT HELEN HOLDING FORTH IN THAT STRAIN
2339-181100-0006 AND MY SELFISH CONCEITED EGOTISM I UNDERSTAND YOU SYBYLLA SHE SAID SLOWLY AND DISTINCTLY BUT YOU MUST NOT BE A COWARD THERE IS ANY AMOUNT OF LOVE AND GOOD IN THE WORLD BUT YOU MUST SEARCH FOR IT
2339-181100-0007 BEING MISUNDERSTOOD IS ONE OF THE TRIALS WE ALL MUST BEAR I THINK THAT EVEN THE MOST COMMON MINDED PERSON IN THE LAND HAS INNER THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS WHICH NO ONE CAN SHARE WITH HIM
2339-181100-0008 I AM ACQUAINTED WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF YOUNG GIRLS SOME OF THEM GOOD AND TRUE BUT YOU HAVE A CHARACTER CONTAINING MORE THAN ANY THREE OF THEM PUT TOGETHER WITH THIS POWER IF PROPERLY MANAGED YOU CAN GAIN THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL LOVE OF YOUR FELLOWS
2339-181100-0009 BUT YOU ARE WILD AND WAYWARD
2339-181100-0010 ELSE YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN A PERSON WITH THE EMPTIEST OF CHARACTERS
2339-181100-0011 BUT TAKE THIS COMFORT IT AS FREQUENTLY PASSES BY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THOSE WITH WELL CHISELLED FEATURES AS THOSE WITH FACES OF PLAINER MOULD SHE TURNED HER FACE AWAY SIGHED AND FORGETFUL OF MY PRESENCE LAPSED INTO SILENCE
2339-181100-0012 I KNEW SHE WAS THINKING OF HERSELF LOVE NOT FRIENDSHIP LOVE FOR ANYONE KNOWING HER MUST GIVE HER LOVE AND RESPECT BUT THE OTHER SORT OF LOVE HAD PASSED HER BY TWELVE YEARS BEFORE I WENT TO CADDAGAT WHEN HELEN BOSSIER HAD BEEN EIGHTEEN
2339-181100-0013 AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND LOVABLE GIRLS IN AUSTRALIA THERE HAD COME TO CADDAGAT ON A VISIT A DASHING COLONEL OF THE NAME OF BELL IN THE ENJOYMENT OF A MOST EXTENDED FURLOUGH FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS HEALTH
2339-181100-0014 I HAVE HEARD THEM SAY SHE WORSHIPPED COLONEL BELL
2339-181100-0015 AND BECOMING ENAMOURED OF ANOTHER WOMAN HE TRIED TO OBTAIN A DIVORCE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS WIFE'S SPOTLESS CHARACTER HE WAS UNABLE TO DO THIS HE THEREFORE DESERTED HER AND OPENLY LIVED WITH THE OTHER WOMAN AS HIS MISTRESS THIS FORCED AUNT HELEN TO RETURN TO CADDAGAT
2339-181100-0016 AND HER MOTHER HAD INDUCED HER TO SUE FOR A JUDICIAL SEPARATION WHICH WAS EASILY OBTAINED WHEN A WOMAN IS SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND IT IS THE RELIGION OF THE WORLD AT LARGE TO CAST THE WHOLE BLAME ON THE WIFE
2339-181100-0017 BY REASON OF HER YOUTH AND PURITY MISSUS BELL HAD NOT AS MUCH TO SUFFER IN THIS WAY AS SOME OTHERS BUT COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING HER LIFE WAS WRECKED SHE HAD BEEN HUMILIATED AND OUTRAGED IN THE CRUELLEST WAY BY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVED AND TRUSTED
2339-181100-0018 NEITHER A WIFE WIDOW NOR MAID
2339-181100-0019 ONE OF THE MOST ESTIMABLY LOVABLE AND NOBLE WOMEN I HAVE EVER MET COME SYBYLLA SHE SAID STARTING UP BRIGHTLY I HAVE A PLAN WILL YOU AGREE TO IT
2339-181100-0020 A VERY UGLY SPECTACLE I THOUGHT AUNT HELEN TURNED THE FACE OF THE LARGE MIRROR FLAT AGAINST THE WALL WHILE I REMARKED DESPONDENTLY YOU CAN MAKE ME ONLY MIDDLING UGLY YOU MUST BE A MAGICIAN COME NOW
2339-181100-0021 I'LL TAKE YOU IN HAND IN THE MORNING I HOPE YOU WILL LIKE YOUR ROOM
2339-181100-0022 AND NOW GOOD NIGHT AND HAPPY DREAMS I AWOKE NEXT MORNING IN VERY FINE SPIRITS
2339-181100-0023 WITH THEIR FACES TO THE WALL AT PRESENT HAIRPINS FANCY COMBS RIBBONS GALORE AND A PRETTY WORK BASKET GREETED MY SIGHT
2339-181100-0024 IT WAS STUFFED FULL WITH ALL KINDS OF PAPER OF GOOD QUALITY FANCY ALL COLOURS SIZES AND SHAPES PLAIN FOREIGN NOTE PENS INK AND A GENEROUS SUPPLY OF STAMPS
2339-181100-0025 I REFER TO A NICE LITTLE BOOKCASE CONTAINING COPIES OF ALL OUR AUSTRALIAN POETS AND TWO OR THREE DOZEN NOVELS WHICH I HAD OFTEN LONGED TO READ I READ THE FIRST CHAPTERS OF FOUR OF THEM AND THEN LOST MYSELF IN GORDON
2339-181100-0026 AND SAT ON MY DRESSING TABLE IN MY NIGHTGOWN REGARDLESS OF COLD UNTIL BROUGHT TO MY SENSES BY THE BREAKFAST BELL I MADE GREAT PACE SCRAMBLED INTO MY CLOTHES HELTER SKELTER AND APPEARED AT TABLE WHEN THE OTHERS HAD BEEN SEATED AND UNFOLDED THEIR SERVIETTES
2339-181100-0027 AUNT HELEN'S TREATMENT FOR MAKING ME PRESENTABLE WAS THE WEARING OF GLOVES AND A SHADY HAT EVERY TIME I WENT OUTSIDE
2339-181100-0028 RUB OFF SOME OF YOUR GLOOMY PESSIMISM AND CULTIVATE A LITTLE MORE HEALTHY GIRLISH VANITY AND YOU WILL DO VERY WELL SHE WOULD SAY I OBSERVED THESE RITES MOST RELIGIOUSLY FOR THREE DAYS THEN I CONTRACTED A SLIGHT ATTACK OF INFLUENZA
2339-181100-0029 A SERVANT GIRL TIPPED A POT OF BOILING POT LIQUOR OVER MY RIGHT FOOT SCALDING IT RATHER SEVERELY AUNT HELEN AND GRANNIE PUT ME TO BED WHERE I YELLED WITH PAIN FOR HOURS LIKE A MAD RED INDIAN DESPITE THEIR APPLYING EVERY ALLEVIATIVE POSSIBLE
2339-181100-0030 I WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY ILL TO BE MISERABLE AND BEING A PAMPERED INVALID WAS THEREFORE FINE FUN AUNT HELEN WAS A WONDERFUL NURSE SHE DRESSED MY FOOT SPLENDIDLY EVERY MORNING AND PUT IT IN A COMFORTABLE POSITION MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY
2339-181100-0031 GRANNIE BROUGHT ME EVERY DAINTY IN THE HOUSE AND SENT SPECIAL MESSENGERS TO GOOL GOOL FOR MORE HAD I BEEN A PROFESSIONAL GLUTTON I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PARADISE EVEN MISTER HAWDEN CONDESCENDED SO FAR AS TO EXPRESS HIS REGRET CONCERNING THE ACCIDENT
2339-181100-0032 AND FAVOURED ME WITH VISITS THROUGHOUT EACH DAY AND ONE SUNDAY HIS GALLANTRY CARRIED HIM TO A GULLY
2339-181100-0033 AND PUT THEM IN A BOWL BESIDE MY BED
2339-181100-0034 THE BOSSIERS AND BEECHAMS WERE LEADERS OF SWELLDOM AMONG THE SQUATTOCRACY UP THE COUNTRY AND FIRM AND INTIMATE FRIENDS THE BEECHAMS RESIDED AT FIVE BOB DOWNS TWELVE MILES FROM CADDAGAT
2339-181100-0035 AND WERE A FAMILY COMPOSED OF TWO MAIDEN LADIES AND THEIR NEPHEW HAROLD ONE OF THESE LADIES WAS AUNT HELEN'S PARTICULAR FRIEND AND THE OTHER HAD STOOD IN THE SAME CAPACITY TO MY MOTHER IN DAYS GONE BY BUT OF LATE YEARS ON ACCOUNT OF HER POVERTY
2339-181100-0036 MOTHER HAD BEEN TOO PROUD TO KEEP UP COMMUNICATION WITH HER
2339-181100-0037 WHILE HAROLD BEECHAM WAS IMMENSELY WEALTHY
2339-181100-0038 ONE MISS BEECHAM WAS AWAY IN MELBOURNE AND THE OTHER NOT WELL ENOUGH TO COME AND SEE ME BUT HAROLD CAME REGULARLY TO INQUIRE HOW I WAS PROGRESSING HE ALWAYS BROUGHT ME A NUMBER OF BEAUTIFUL APPLES
2339-181100-0039 THIS KINDNESS WAS BECAUSE THE CADDAGAT ORCHARD HAD BEEN TOO INFESTED WITH CODLIN MOTH FOR GRANNIE TO SAVE ANY LAST SEASON AUNT HELEN USED TO MISCHIEVOUSLY TEASE ME ABOUT THIS ATTENTION HERE COMES HARRY BEECHAM WITH SOME MORE APPLES SHE WOULD SAY
2339-181100-0040 NO DOUBT HE IS FAR MORE CALCULATING AND ARTFUL THAN I THOUGHT HE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING
2339-181100-0041 AND WHEN HE SEES ME WON'T BE VEXED THAT ALL HIS WORK HAS BEEN FOR NOTHING PERHAPS THOUGH IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO DESCRIBE ME OR I WILL GET NO MORE APPLES I WOULD REPLY AUNT HELEN WAS A CLEVER NEEDLEWOMAN SHE MADE ALL GRANNIE'S DRESSES AND HER OWN
2339-181100-0042 NOW SHE WAS MAKING SOME FOR ME WHICH HOWEVER I WAS NOT TO SEE UNTIL I WORE THEM AUNT HELEN HAD THIS AS A PLEASANT SURPRISE
2339-181100-0043 WHILE IN BED GRANNIE AND AUNTIE BEING BUSY I WAS OFTEN LEFT HOURS ALONE
2339-181100-0044 DEVOURED THE CONTENTS OF MY BOOKSHELF THE PLEASURE SO EXQUISITE AS TO BE ALMOST PAIN WHICH I DERIVED FROM THE BOOKS AND ESPECIALLY THE AUSTRALIAN POETS IS BEYOND DESCRIPTION
2339-181100-0045 BUT AT LAST HERE WAS CONGENIALITY HERE WAS COMPANIONSHIP THE WEIRD WITCHERY OF MIGHTY BUSH THE BREATH OF WIDE SUNLIT PLAINS
2339-181100-0046 THE SOUND OF CAMP BELLS AND JINGLE OF HOBBLE CHAINS FLOATING ON THE SOFT TWILIGHT BREEZES HAD COME TO THESE MEN
2339-181100-0047 AND BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT HELD OUT HIS HAND AND TOOK ME WITH HIM THE REGRET OF IT ALL WAS I COULD NEVER MEET THEM BYRON THACKERAY DICKENS LONGFELLOW GORDON KENDALL THE MEN I LOVED ALL WERE DEAD
2339-181100-0048 BUT BLISSFUL THOUGHT CAINE PATERSON AND LAWSON WERE STILL LIVING BREATHING HUMAN BEINGS
