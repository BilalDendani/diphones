3179-7153-0000 ANNE HAD TO LIVE THROUGH MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AS IT HAPPENED ALMOST A MONTH HAVING ELAPSED SINCE THE LINIMENT CAKE EPISODE IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HER TO GET INTO FRESH TROUBLE OF SOME SORT LITTLE MISTAKES SUCH AS ABSENTMINDEDLY EMPTYING A PAN OF SKIM MILK
3179-7153-0001 NOT REALLY BEING WORTH COUNTING A WEEK AFTER THE TEA AT THE MANSE DIANA BARRY GAVE A PARTY
3179-7153-0002 WHEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE BARRY GARDEN A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THEIR GAMES AND RIPE FOR ANY ENTICING FORM OF MISCHIEF WHICH MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF THIS PRESENTLY TOOK THE FORM OF DARING DARING WAS THE FASHIONABLE AMUSEMENT AMONG THE AVONLEA SMALL FRY JUST THEN
3179-7153-0003 WOULD FILL A BOOK BY THEMSELVES FIRST OF ALL CARRIE SLOANE DARED RUBY GILLIS TO CLIMB TO A CERTAIN POINT IN THE HUGE OLD WILLOW TREE BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR WHICH RUBY GILLIS ALBEIT IN MORTAL DREAD OF THE FAT GREEN CATERPILLARS WITH WHICH SAID TREE WAS INFESTED
3179-7153-0004 THEN JOSIE PYE DARED JANE ANDREWS TO HOP ON HER LEFT LEG AROUND THE GARDEN WITHOUT STOPPING ONCE OR PUTTING HER RIGHT FOOT TO THE GROUND WHICH JANE ANDREWS GAMELY TRIED TO DO
3179-7153-0005 AND HAD TO CONFESS HERSELF DEFEATED JOSIE'S TRIUMPH BEING RATHER MORE PRONOUNCED THAN GOOD TASTE PERMITTED ANNE SHIRLEY DARED HER TO WALK ALONG THE TOP OF THE BOARD FENCE WHICH BOUNDED THE GARDEN TO THE EAST NOW TO WALK BOARD FENCES REQUIRES MORE SKILL AND STEADINESS OF HEAD AND HEEL
3179-7153-0006 THAN ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE WHO HAS NEVER TRIED IT BUT JOSIE PYE
3179-7153-0007 DULY CULTIVATED FOR WALKING BOARD FENCES
3179-7153-0008 RELUCTANT ADMIRATION GREETED HER EXPLOIT FOR MOST OF THE OTHER GIRLS COULD APPRECIATE IT

3179-7153-0013 AMID BREATHLESS SILENCE GAINED THE RIDGEPOLE
3179-7153-0014 AND THAT WALKING RIDGEPOLES WAS NOT A THING IN WHICH YOUR IMAGINATION HELPED YOU OUT MUCH NEVERTHELESS SHE MANAGED TO TAKE SEVERAL STEPS BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE CAME THEN SHE SWAYED LOST HER BALANCE
3179-7153-0015 STUMBLED STAGGERED AND FELL SLIDING DOWN OVER THE SUN BAKED ROOF AND CRASHING OFF IT THROUGH THE TANGLE OF VIRGINIA CREEPER BENEATH ALL BEFORE THE DISMAYED CIRCLE BELOW COULD GIVE A SIMULTANEOUS TERRIFIED SHRIEK

3179-7153-0017 TO THE IMMENSE RELIEF OF ALL THE GIRLS

3179-7153-0019 NO DIANA I AM NOT KILLED BUT I THINK I AM RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS
3179-7153-0020 SOBBED CARRIE SLOANE OH WHERE ANNE BEFORE ANNE COULD ANSWER MISSUS BARRY APPEARED ON THE SCENE AT SIGHT OF HER ANNE TRIED TO SCRAMBLE TO HER FEET BUT SANK BACK AGAIN WITH A SHARP LITTLE CRY OF PAIN WHAT'S THE MATTER
3179-7153-0021 MY ANKLE GASPED ANNE OH DIANA PLEASE FIND YOUR FATHER AND ASK HIM TO TAKE ME HOME
3179-7153-0022 MARILLA WAS OUT IN THE ORCHARD PICKING A PANFUL OF SUMMER APPLES WHEN SHE SAW MISTER BARRY COMING OVER THE LOG BRIDGE AND UP THE SLOPE WITH MISSUS BARRY BESIDE HIM AND A WHOLE PROCESSION OF LITTLE GIRLS TRAILING AFTER HIM
3179-7153-0023 AT THAT MOMENT MARILLA HAD A REVELATION IN THE SUDDEN STAB OF FEAR THAT PIERCED HER VERY HEART SHE REALIZED WHAT ANNE HAD COME TO MEAN TO HER
3179-7153-0024 THAT ANNE WAS DEARER TO HER THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON EARTH
3179-7153-0025 SENSIBLE MARILLA HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS ANNE HERSELF ANSWERED LIFTING HER HEAD DON'T BE VERY FRIGHTENED MARILLA I WAS WALKING THE RIDGEPOLE AND I FELL OFF I EXPECT I HAVE SPRAINED MY ANKLE
3179-7153-0026 I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN YOU'D GO AND DO SOMETHING OF THE SORT WHEN I LET YOU GO TO THAT PARTY SAID MARILLA SHARP AND SHREWISH IN HER VERY RELIEF
3179-7153-0027 MERCY ME THE CHILD HAS GONE AND FAINTED IT WAS QUITE TRUE OVERCOME BY THE PAIN OF HER INJURY ANNE HAD ONE MORE OF HER WISHES GRANTED TO HER SHE HAD FAINTED DEAD AWAY MATTHEW HASTILY SUMMONED FROM THE HARVEST FIELD WAS STRAIGHTWAY DISPATCHED FOR THE DOCTOR
3179-7153-0028 WHO IN DUE TIME CAME TO DISCOVER THAT THE INJURY WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN THEY HAD SUPPOSED ANNE'S ANKLE WAS BROKEN
3179-7153-0029 A PLAINTIVE VOICE GREETED HER FROM THE BED
3179-7153-0030 IT WAS YOUR OWN FAULT SAID MARILLA TWITCHING DOWN THE BLIND AND LIGHTING A LAMP AND THAT IS JUST WHY YOU SHOULD BE SORRY FOR ME SAID ANNE
3179-7153-0031 I'D HAVE STAYED ON GOOD FIRM GROUND AND LET THEM DARE AWAY SUCH ABSURDITY SAID MARILLA ANNE SIGHED BUT YOU HAVE SUCH STRENGTH OF MIND MARILLA I HAVEN'T
3179-7153-0032 OH I AM AN AFFLICTED MORTAL
3179-7153-0033 THERE THERE I'M NOT CROSS SAID MARILLA YOU'RE AN UNLUCKY CHILD THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT AS YOU SAY YOU'LL HAVE THE SUFFERING OF IT
3179-7153-0034 ANNE HAD GOOD REASON TO BLESS HER IMAGINATION MANY A TIME AND OFT DURING THE TEDIOUS SEVEN WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED
3179-7153-0035 AND TELL HER ALL THE HAPPENINGS IN THE JUVENILE WORLD OF AVONLEA
3179-7153-0036 BUT THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE TO IT MARILLA YOU FIND OUT HOW MANY FRIENDS YOU HAVE WHY EVEN SUPERINTENDENT BELL CAME TO SEE ME AND HE'S REALLY A VERY FINE MAN
3179-7153-0037 I BELIEVE NOW HE REALLY DOES MEAN THEM
3179-7153-0038 HE COULD GET OVER THAT IF HE'D TAKE A LITTLE TROUBLE I GAVE HIM A GOOD BROAD HINT
3179-7153-0039 IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF SUPERINTENDENT BELL EVER BEING A BOY EVEN MY IMAGINATION HAS ITS LIMITS
3179-7153-0040 NOW IT'S SO EASY TO IMAGINE MISSUS ALLAN AS A LITTLE GIRL MISSUS ALLAN HAS BEEN TO SEE ME FOURTEEN TIMES ISN'T THAT SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF MARILLA
3179-7153-0041 EVEN JOSIE PYE CAME TO SEE ME
3179-7153-0042 IF I HAD BEEN KILLED SHE WOULD HAD TO CARRY A DARK BURDEN OF REMORSE ALL HER LIFE DIANA HAS BEEN A FAITHFUL FRIEND SHE'S BEEN OVER EVERY DAY TO CHEER MY LONELY PILLOW BUT OH I SHALL BE SO GLAD WHEN I CAN GO TO SCHOOL FOR I'VE HEARD SUCH EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THE NEW TEACHER
