329-861-0000 CHAPTER NINE THE SIEGE OF HENNEBON THE BESIEGERS OF HENNEBON WERE GREATLY DISCOURAGED AT THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE OF THE COUNTESS THEY HAD ALREADY ATTEMPTED SEVERAL DESPERATE ASSAULTS
329-861-0001 BUT HAD EACH TIME BEEN REPULSED WITH VERY HEAVY LOSS THEY NOW SENT TO RENNES FOR TWELVE OF THE IMMENSE MACHINES USED IN BATTERING WALLS WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND THERE ON A FALSE REPORT OF THE WEAKNESS OF HENNEBON
329-861-0002 IN A FEW DAYS THESE ARRIVED AND WERE SPEEDILY SET TO WORK AND IMMENSE MASSES OF STONE WERE HURLED AT THE WALLS WALTER CONTINUED TO ACT AS THE COUNTESS'S ESPECIAL SQUIRE SHE HAD INFORMED SIR WILLIAM CADDOUDAL
329-861-0003 AND SIR JOHN POWIS THAT IT WAS AT HIS SUGGESTION THAT SHE HAD MADE THE SUDDEN ATTACK UPON THE FRENCH CAMP AND HE HAD GAINED GREAT CREDIT THEREBY THE EFFECT OF THE NEW MACHINES WAS SPEEDILY VISIBLE
329-861-0004 THE WALLS CRUMBLED UNDER THE TREMENDOUS BLOWS AND ALTHOUGH THE ARCHERS HARASSED BY THEIR ARROWS THE MEN WORKING THEM THE FRENCH SPEEDILY ERECTED SCREENS WHICH SHELTERED THEM FROM THEIR FIRE THE SPIRITS OF THE DEFENDERS BEGAN TO SINK RAPIDLY
329-861-0005 AS THEY SAW THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME GREAT BREACHES WOULD BE MADE IN THE WALLS AND THAT ALL THE HORRORS AND DISASTERS OF A CITY TAKEN BY ASSAULT AWAITED THEM THE BISHOP OF QUIMPER WHO WAS WITHIN THE WALLS ENTERED INTO SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIS NEPHEW
329-861-0006 WHO HAD GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY
329-861-0007 AND WAS NOW WITH THE BESIEGING ARMY THE BESIEGERS DELIGHTED TO FIND AN ALLY WITHIN THE WALLS WHO MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM THE HEAVY LOSSES WHICH AN ASSAULT WOULD ENTAIL UPON THEM AT ONCE EMBRACED HIS OFFERS AND PROMISED HIM A LARGE RECOMPENSE
329-861-0008 IF HE WOULD BRING OVER THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND NOBLES THE WILY BISHOP SET TO WORK AND THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SOON VISIBLE OPEN GRUMBLING BROKE FORTH AT THE HARDSHIPS WHICH WERE ENDURED
329-861-0009 AND AT THE PROSPECT OF THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER WHICH WOULD ATTEND A STORM WHEN ALL HOPE OF A SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE WAS AT AN END I FEAR WALTER SIR JOHN SAID ONE MORNING THAT THE END IS AT HAND
329-861-0010 AND ALL THAT I CAN SAY TO KEEP UP THEIR SPIRITS IS USELESS UPON OUR OWN LITTLE BAND WE CAN RELY BUT I DOUBT IF OUTSIDE THEM A SINGLE DETERMINED MAN IS TO BE FOUND IN THE TOWN IN VAIN DO I SPEAK OF THE ARRIVAL OF SIR WALTER MANNY
329-861-0011 NEARLY NINETY DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE SAILED AND ALL HOPE OF HIS COMING IS GONE I POINT OUT TO THEM THAT CONTRARY WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT HE MAY ARRIVE BUT THEY WILL NOT HEAR ME
329-861-0012 THE BISHOP HAS GAINED OVER THE WHOLE OF THEM BY HIS PROMISES THAT NONE SHALL BE MOLESTED IN PROPERTY OR ESTATE SHOULD THEY SURRENDER IT IS SAD TO SEE THE COUNTESS WALTER REPLIED SHE WHO HAS SHOWN SUCH HIGH SPIRIT THROUGHOUT THE SIEGE
329-861-0013 NOW DOES NOTHING BUT WEEP FOR SHE KNOWS THAT WITH HER AND HER CHILD IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH THE CAUSE OF THE COUNT IS LOST IF SHE COULD CARRY OFF THE CHILD BY SEA SHE WOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE FALL OF THE TOWN BUT THE FRENCH SHIPS LIE THICK ROUND THE PORT
329-861-0014 THE COUNTESS BEGGED FOR A LITTLE FURTHER DELAY BUT IN VAIN AND WITHDREW TO THE TURRET WHERE SHE HAD FOR SO MANY WEARY WEEKS WATCHED THE HORIZON IN HOPES OF SEEING THE SAILS OF THE APPROACHING FLEET WALTER WAS AT THE TIME WITH SIR JOHN POWIS ON THE WALLS
329-861-0015 WHO SUMMONED THE TOWN TO SURRENDER MANY STANDING ON THE WALLS SHOUTED THAT THE GATES SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN BUT SIR JOHN RETURNED FOR ANSWER THAT HE MUST CONSULT THE COUNTESS AND THAT UPON HER ANSWER MUST DEPEND WHETHER HE AND HIS MEN WOULD DEFEND THE BREACH UNTIL THE LAST
329-861-0016 COME WITH ME WALTER HE SAID WE MUST FAIN PERSUADE THE COUNTESS IF SHE SAYS NO WE ENGLISHMEN WILL DIE IN THE BREACH BUT THOUGH READY TO GIVE MY LIFE FOR SO BRAVE A LADY I OWN THAT IT IS USELESS TO FIGHT LONGER
329-861-0017 SAVE OUR OWN LITTLE BAND NOT ONE IN THE TOWN WILL LIFT A SWORD AGAIN SUCH RESISTANCE AS WE CAN OFFER WILL BUT INFLAME THEM TO FURY AND ALL THE HORRORS OF A SACK WILL BE INFLICTED UPON THE INHABITANTS THERE SHE IS POOR LADY ON THE TURRET
329-861-0018 GAZING AS USUAL SEAWARD SUDDENLY THEY SAW HER THROW UP HER ARMS AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE CITY SHE CRIED AS SHE PERCEIVED THE ENGLISH KNIGHT I SEE THEM I SEE THEM THE ENGLISH FLEET ARE COMING RUN UP WALTER
329-861-0019 SIR JOHN EXCLAIMED MAYBE THE COUNTESS IS DISTRAUGHT WITH HER SORROWS WALTER DASHED UP TO THE TURRET AND LOOKING SEAWARD BEHELD RISING OVER THE HORIZON A NUMBER OF MASTS HURRAH SIR JOHN HE SHOUTED WE ARE SAVED
329-861-0020 THE ENGLISH FLEET IS IN SIGHT MANY OTHERS HEARD THE SHOUT AND THE TIDINGS RAN LIKE LIGHTNING THROUGH THE TOWN IN WILD EXCITEMENT THE PEOPLE RAN TO THE BATTLEMENTS AND ROOFS AND WITH CHEERING
329-861-0021 GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN A LEADING PART IN THE INTRIGUE THESE LEAVING THE CITY BY A GATE AT WHICH THEY HAD PLACED SOME OF THEIR OWN FACTION TO OPEN IT TO THE FRENCH ISSUED OUT AND MADE THEIR WAY TO THE ASSAILANTS CAMP
329-861-0022 TO GIVE NEWS OF THE ALTERED SITUATION DON LOUIS AT ONCE ORDERED AN ATTACK TO BE MADE WITH HIS WHOLE FORCE IN HOPES OF CAPTURING THE PLACE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE ENGLISH SUCCOUR BUT ANIMATED BY THEIR NEW HOPES THOSE SO LATELY DESPONDENT AND READY TO YIELD
329-861-0023 MANNED THE BREACHES AND REPULSED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ALL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE FRENCH TO CARRY THEM WHILE THE STRUGGLE WAS STILL GOING ON THE COUNTESS AIDED BY THE WIVES OF THE BURGHERS BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARING A SUMPTUOUS FEAST IN HONOUR OF HER DELIVERERS
329-861-0024 WHO WERE FAST APPROACHING THEIR SHIPS IMPELLED BY A STRONG AND FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VESSELS OF THE FRENCH HASTILY DREW OFF AND THE ENGLISH FLEET SAILED INTO THE PORT HAILED BY THE CHEERS OF THE INHABITANTS THE COUNTESS HERSELF RECEIVED SIR WALTER MANNY
329-861-0025 ON HIS LANDING AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN OFFERING HOSPITALITY TO THE MEN AT ARMS AND ARCHERS AH SIR JOHN POWIS SIR WALTER EXCLAIMED WHAT
329-861-0026 I HAD GIVEN YOU UP FOR LOST WE THOUGHT YOU HAD GONE DOWN IN THE GALE THE NIGHT YOU STARTED WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE FLEET SIR WALTER BUT THE MASTER HELD ON AND WE ARRIVED HERE FOUR DAYS AFTER WE PUT OUT WE TOOK PART IN THE SIEGE OF RENNES
329-861-0027 AND HAVE SINCE DONE OUR BEST TO AID THE COUNTESS HERE AND THEIR BEST HAS BEEN MUCH THE COUNTESS SAID NOT TO SAY HOW BRAVELY THEY HAVE FOUGHT UPON THE WALLS IT IS TO SIR JOHN AND HIS LITTLE BAND THAT I OWE IT THAT THE TOWN WAS NOT SURRENDERED DAYS AGO
329-861-0028 THEY ALONE REMAINED STEADFAST WHEN ALL OTHERS FELL AWAY AND IT IS DUE TO THEM THAT I AM STILL ABLE AS MISTRESS OF THIS TOWN TO GREET YOU ON YOUR ARRIVAL NEXT TO SIR JOHN HIMSELF
329-861-0029 AND STOOD BY ME AND TO WHOSE SUGGESTIONS I OWE IT THAT I WAS ABLE AT THE FIRST TO SALLY OUT AND DESTROY THE FRENCH CAMP WHILE THEY WERE ATTACKING THE WALLS AND SO GREATLY HINDERED THEIR MEASURES AGAINST THE TOWN AND NOW SIR WILL YOU FOLLOW ME
329-861-0030 I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU AND YOUR KNIGHTS SUCH A BANQUET OF WELCOME AS OUR POOR MEANS WILL ALLOW AND MY TOWNSPEOPLE WILL SEE THAT GOOD FARE IS SET BEFORE YOUR SOLDIERS
329-861-0031 THAT EVENING THERE WAS HIGH FEASTING IN THE TOWN ALTHOUGH THE CRASH OF THE HEAVY STONES CAST BY THE FRENCH MACHINES AGAINST THE WALLS NEVER CEASED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING SIR WALTER MANNY MADE A SURVEY OF THE PLACE AND OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE ENEMY
329-861-0032 AND PROPOSED TO HIS KNIGHTS TO SALLY FORTH AT ONCE AND DESTROY THE LARGEST OF THE ENEMY'S MACHINES WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP CLOSE TO THE WALLS IN A FEW MINUTES THE KNIGHTS WERE ARMED AND MOUNTED THREE HUNDRED KNIGHTS AND ESQUIRES WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE SORTIE
329-861-0033 THEY WERE TO BE FOLLOWED BY A STRONG BODY OF MEN AT ARMS AS SOON AS THE GATES WERE OPENED A NUMBER OF ARCHERS ISSUED OUT AND TAKING THEIR PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE MOAT POURED A RAIN OF ARROWS UPON THE MEN WORKING THE MACHINE AND THOSE GUARDING IT MOST OF THESE
329-861-0034 CUT DOWN ALL WHO OPPOSED THEM AND SETTING FIRE TO THE HUTS RETIRED TOWARDS THE CITY BY THIS TIME THE FRENCH WERE THOROUGHLY ALARMED AND NUMBERS OF KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS DASHED AFTER THE LITTLE BODY OF ENGLISH CAVALRY
329-861-0035 AND MANY ON BOTH SIDES WERE OVERTHROWN THEN AS LARGE REINFORCEMENTS WERE CONTINUALLY ARRIVING TO THE FRENCH SIR WALTER CALLED OFF HIS MEN AND RETIRED SLOWLY ON REACHING THE MOAT HE HALTED HIS FORCES
329-861-0036 THE KNIGHTS WHEELED AND PRESENTED A FIRM FACE TO THE ENEMY COVERING THE ENTRANCE OF THEIR FOLLOWERS INTO THE GATE THE FRENCH CHIVALRY THUNDERED DOWN UPON THE LITTLE BODY
329-861-0037 MANY KNIGHTS WERE STRUCK THROUGH THE BARS OF THEIR VIZORS OR THE JOINTS OF THEIR MAIL THE HORSES THOUGH DEFENDED BY IRON TRAPPINGS
329-861-0038 THE ARRIVAL OF THE REINFORCEMENTS AND THE PROOF OF SKILL AND VIGOUR GIVEN BY THE ENGLISH LEADER TOGETHER WITH THE TERROR CAUSED BY THE TERRIBLE EFFECT OF THE ENGLISH ARROWS SHOOK THE RESOLUTION OF DON LOUIS AND HIS TROOPS
