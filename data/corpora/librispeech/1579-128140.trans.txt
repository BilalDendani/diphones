1579-128140-0000 A FEW YEARS AGO SOME OF OUR MINOR POETS TRIED TO SET SCIENCE TO MUSIC TO WRITE SONNETS ON THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AND ODES TO NATURAL SELECTION SOCIALISM AND THE SYMPATHY WITH THOSE WHO ARE UNFIT SEEM
1579-128140-0001 IF WE MAY JUDGE FROM MISS NESBIT'S REMARKABLE VOLUME TO BE THE NEW THEME OF SONG THE FRESH SUBJECT MATTER FOR POETRY THE CHANGE HAS SOME ADVANTAGES SCIENTIFIC LAWS ARE AT ONCE TOO ABSTRACT AND TOO CLEARLY DEFINED
1579-128140-0002 AND EVEN THE VISIBLE ARTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO TRANSLATE INTO ANY SYMBOLS OF BEAUTY THE DISCOVERIES OF MODERN SCIENCE AT THE ARTS AND CRAFTS EXHIBITION WE FIND THE COSMOGONY OF MOSES NOT THE COSMOGONY OF DARWIN
1579-128140-0003 TO MISTER BURNE JONES MAN IS STILL A FALLEN ANGEL NOT A GREATER APE POVERTY AND MISERY UPON THE OTHER HAND ARE TERRIBLY CONCRETE THINGS WE FIND THEIR INCARNATION EVERYWHERE
1579-128140-0004 AND AS WE ARE DISCUSSING A MATTER OF ART WE HAVE NO HESITATION IN SAYING THAT THEY ARE NOT DEVOID OF PICTURESQUENESS THE ETCHER OR THE PAINTER FINDS IN THEM A SUBJECT MADE TO HIS HAND
1579-128140-0005 AND THE POET HAS ADMIRABLE OPPORTUNITIES OF DRAWING WEIRD AND DRAMATIC CONTRASTS BETWEEN THE PURPLE OF THE RICH AND THE RAGS OF THE POOR FROM MISS NESBIT'S BOOK COMES NOT MERELY THE VOICE OF SYMPATHY BUT ALSO THE CRY OF REVOLUTION
1579-128140-0006 THIS IS OUR VENGEANCE DAY OUR MASTERS MADE FAT WITH OUR FASTING SHALL FALL BEFORE US LIKE CORN WHEN THE SICKLE FOR HARVEST IS STRONG OLD WRONGS SHALL GIVE MIGHT TO OUR ARM
1579-128140-0007 REMEMBRANCE OF WRONGS SHALL MAKE LASTING THE GRAVES WE WILL DIG FOR OUR TYRANTS WE BORE WITH TOO MUCH AND TOO LONG THE POEM FROM WHICH WE TAKE THIS STANZA IS REMARKABLY VIGOROUS
1579-128140-0008 AND THE ONLY CONSOLATION THAT WE CAN OFFER TO THE TIMID AND THE TORIES IS THAT AS LONG AS SO MUCH STRENGTH IS EMPLOYED IN BLOWING THE TRUMPET THE SWORD SO FAR AS MISS NESBIT IS CONCERNED WILL PROBABLY REMAIN SHEATHED
1579-128140-0009 PERSONALLY AND LOOKING AT THE MATTER FROM A PURELY ARTISTIC POINT OF VIEW WE PREFER MISS NESBIT'S GENTLER MOMENTS HER EYE FOR NATURE IS PECULIARLY KEEN
1579-128140-0010 SHE HAS ALWAYS AN EXQUISITE SENSE OF COLOUR AND SOMETIMES A MOST DELICATE EAR FOR MUSIC MANY OF HER POEMS SUCH AS THE MOAT HOUSE ABSOLUTION AND THE SINGING OF THE MAGNIFICAT ARE TRUE WORKS OF ART
1579-128140-0011 WITH ITS DAINTY DANCING MEASURE ITS DELICATE AND WILFUL FANCY AND THE SHARP POIGNANT NOTE OF PASSION THAT SUDDENLY STRIKES ACROSS IT MARRING ITS LIGHT LAUGHTER AND LENDING ITS BEAUTY A TERRIBLE AND TRAGIC MEANING
1579-128140-0012 FROM THE SONNETS WE TAKE THIS AT RANDOM NOT SPRING TOO LAVISH OF HER BUD AND LEAF BUT AUTUMN WITH SAD EYES AND BROWS AUSTERE WHEN FIELDS ARE BARE
1579-128140-0013 AND WOODS ARE BROWN AND SERE AND LEADEN SKIES WEEP THEIR ENCHANTLESS GRIEF SPRING IS SO MUCH TOO BRIGHT SINCE SPRING IS BRIEF AND IN OUR HEARTS IS AUTUMN ALL THE YEAR
1579-128140-0014 LEAST SAD WHEN THE WIDE PASTURES ARE MOST DREAR AND FIELDS GRIEVE MOST ROBBED OF THE LAST GOLD SHEAF THESE TOO THE OPENING STANZAS OF THE LAST ENVOY ARE CHARMING
1579-128140-0015 THE WIND THAT THROUGH THE SILENT WOODLAND BLOWS O'ER RIPPLING CORN AND DREAMING PASTURES GOES STRAIGHT TO THE GARDEN WHERE THE HEART OF SPRING FAINTS IN THE HEART OF SUMMER'S EARLIEST ROSE
1579-128140-0016 DIMPLING THE MEADOW'S GRASSY GREEN AND GREY BY FURZE THAT YELLOWS ALL THE COMMON WAY GATHERING THE GLADNESS OF THE COMMON BROOM AND TOO PERSISTENT FRAGRANCE OF THE MAY
1579-128140-0017 GATHERING WHATEVER IS OF SWEET AND DEAR THE WANDERING WIND HAS PASSED AWAY FROM HERE HAS PASSED TO WHERE WITHIN YOUR GARDEN WAITS THE CONCENTRATED SWEETNESS OF THE YEAR
1579-128140-0018 BUT MISS NESBIT IS NOT TO BE JUDGED BY MERE EXTRACTS HER WORK IS TOO RICH AND TOO FULL FOR THAT MISTER FOSTER IS AN AMERICAN POET WHO HAS READ HAWTHORNE
1579-128140-0019 WHICH IS WISE OF HIM AND IMITATED LONGFELLOW WHICH IS NOT QUITE SO COMMENDABLE HIS REBECCA THE WITCH IS A STORY OF OLD SALEM WRITTEN IN THE METRE OF HIAWATHA WITH A FEW RHYMES THROWN IN
1579-128140-0020 AND CONCEIVED IN THE SPIRIT OF THE AUTHOR OF THE SCARLET LETTER THE COMBINATION IS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT THE POEM AS A PIECE OF FICTION HAS MANY ELEMENTS OF INTEREST
1579-128140-0021 MISTER FOSTER SEEMS TO BE QUITE POPULAR IN AMERICA THE CHICAGO TIMES FINDS HIS FANCIES VERY PLAYFUL AND SUNNY AND THE INDIANAPOLIS JOURNAL SPEAKS OF HIS TENDER AND APPRECIATIVE STYLE
1579-128140-0022 HE IS CERTAINLY A CLEVER STORY TELLER AND THE NOAH'S ARK WHICH SOMEHOW HAD ESCAPED THE SHERIFF'S HAND IS BRIGHT AND AMUSING AND ITS PATHOS LIKE THE PATHOS OF A MELODRAMA
1579-128140-0023 IS A PURELY PICTURESQUE ELEMENT NOT INTENDED TO BE TAKEN TOO SERIOUSLY WE CANNOT HOWEVER RECOMMEND THE DEFINITELY COMIC POEMS THEY ARE VERY DEPRESSING MISTER JOHN RENTON DENNING
1579-128140-0024 DEDICATES HIS BOOK TO THE DUKE OF CONNAUGHT WHO IS COLONEL IN CHIEF OF THE RIFLE BRIGADE IN WHICH REGIMENT MISTER DENNING WAS ONCE HIMSELF A PRIVATE SOLDIER HIS POEMS SHOW AN ARDENT LOVE OF KEATS
1579-128140-0025 AND A PROFLIGATE LUXURIANCE OF ADJECTIVES AND I WILL BUILD A BOWER FOR THEE SWEET A VERDUROUS SHELTER FROM THE NOONDAY HEAT THICK RUSTLING IVY
1579-128140-0026 BROAD AND GREEN AND SHINING WITH HONEYSUCKLE CREEPING UP AND TWINING ITS NECTARED SWEETNESS ROUND THEE VIOLETS AND DAISIES WITH THEIR FRINGED CORONETS AND THE WHITE BELLS OF TINY VALLEY LILIES
1579-128140-0027 SHALL GROW AROUND THY DWELLING LUSCIOUS FARE OF FRUIT ON WHICH THE SUN HAS LAUGHED THIS IS THE IMMATURE MANNER OF ENDYMION WITH A VENGEANCE AND IS NOT TO BE ENCOURAGED STILL
1579-128140-0028 MISTER DENNING IS NOT ALWAYS SO ANXIOUS TO REPRODUCE THE FAULTS OF HIS MASTER SOMETIMES HE WRITES WITH WONDERFUL GRACE AND CHARM SYLVIA FOR INSTANCE IS AN EXCEEDINGLY PRETTY POEM
1579-128140-0029 AND THE EXILE HAS MANY POWERFUL AND PICTURESQUE LINES MISTER DENNING SHOULD MAKE A SELECTION OF HIS POEMS AND PUBLISH THEM IN BETTER TYPE AND ON BETTER PAPER THE GET UP OF HIS VOLUME
1579-128140-0030 TO USE THE SLANG PHRASE OF OUR YOUNG POETS IS VERY BAD INDEED AND REFLECTS NO CREDIT ON THE PRESS OF THE EDUCATION SOCIETY OF BOMBAY THE BEST POEM IN MISTER JOSEPH MC KIM'S LITTLE BOOK IS
1579-128140-0031 UNDOUBTEDLY WILLIAM THE SILENT IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SPIRITED MACAULAY STYLE AWAKE AWAKE YE BURGHERS BRAVE SHOUT SHOUT FOR JOY AND SING WITH THIRTY THOUSAND AT HIS BACK
1579-128140-0032 COMES FORTH YOUR HERO KING NOW SHAKE FOR EVER FROM YOUR NECKS THE SERVILE YOKE OF SPAIN AND RAISE YOUR ARMS AND END FOR AYE FALSE ALVA'S CRUEL REIGN HO
1579-128140-0033 BRUSSELS FAIR POUR FORTH YOUR WARRIORS BRAVE AND JOIN YOUR HANDS WITH HIM WHO COMES YOUR HEARTHS AND HOMES TO SAVE SOME PEOPLE LIKE THIS STYLE MISSUS HORACE DOBELL
1579-128140-0034 WHO HAS ARRIVED AT HER SEVENTEENTH VOLUME OF POETRY SEEMS VERY ANGRY WITH EVERYBODY AND WRITES POEMS TO A HUMAN TOAD
1579-128140-0035 SUCH AS SOME ONE NOT A FRIEND OF
1579-128140-0036 DID ON A CERTAIN OCCASION OF A GLIB UTTERANCE OF CALUMNIES
1579-128140-0037 IN MANY CASES I HAVE DELIBERATELY EMPLOYED ALLITERATION BELIEVING THAT THE MUSIC OF A LINE IS INTENSIFIED THEREBY SAYS MISTER KELLY IN THE PREFACE TO HIS POEMS AND THERE IS CERTAINLY NO REASON WHY MISTER KELLY
1579-128140-0038 SHOULD NOT EMPLOY THIS ARTFUL AID ALLITERATION IS ONE OF THE MANY SECRETS OF ENGLISH POETRY AND AS LONG AS IT IS KEPT A SECRET IT IS ADMIRABLE MISTER KELLY IT MUST BE ADMITTED
1579-128140-0039 USES IT WITH BECOMING MODESTY AND RESERVE AND NEVER SUFFERS IT TO TRAMMEL THE WHITE FEET OF HIS BRIGHT AND BUOYANT MUSE HIS VOLUME IS IN MANY WAYS EXTREMELY INTERESTING MOST MINOR POETS ARE AT THEIR BEST IN SONNETS
1579-128140-0040 BUT WITH HIM IT IS NOT SO HIS SONNETS ARE TOO NARRATIVE TOO DIFFUSE AND TOO LYRICAL THEY LACK CONCENTRATION AND CONCENTRATION IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF A SONNET
1579-128140-0041 WHICH IS ELABORATELY COMMONPLACE BUT THE FLIGHT OF CALLIOPE HAS MANY CHARMING PASSAGES IT IS A PITY THAT MISTER KELLY HAS INCLUDED THE POEMS WRITTEN BEFORE THE AGE OF NINETEEN YOUTH IS RARELY ORIGINAL
1579-128140-0042 OF ALBANY NEW YORK IT IS A WORD BORROWED FROM THE INDIANS AND SHOULD WE THINK BE RETURNED TO THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE MOST CURIOUS POEM OF THE BOOK IS CALLED SCENES AT THE HOLY HOME
1579-128140-0043 THEY ARE ANACHRONISMS NOW AND IT IS ODD THAT THEY SHOULD COME TO US FROM THE UNITED STATES IN MATTERS OF THIS KIND WE SHOULD HAVE SOME PROTECTION
