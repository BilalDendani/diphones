1066-5330-0000 COLD AND STILL LOOKED THE OLD HOUSE IN THE MOONBEAMS NEVER WAS THE MOON BRIGHTER IT LIGHTED THE FAR STRETCHING GARDEN IT ILLUMINATED EVEN THE WEATHERCOCK ALOFT IT SHONE UPON THE PORTICO AND UPON ONE WHO APPEARED IN IT
1066-5330-0001 WHAT WAS IT THAT HAD STEPPED OUT OF THAT GROVE OF TREES AND MYSTERIOUSLY BECKONED TO HER AS SHE STOOD AT THE WINDOW TURNING HER HEART TO SICKNESS AS SHE GAZED WAS IT A HUMAN BEING ONE TO BRING MORE EVIL TO THE HOUSE WHERE SO MUCH EVIL HAD ALREADY FALLEN
1066-5330-0002 WAS IT A SUPERNATURAL VISITANT OR WAS IT BUT A DELUSION OF HER OWN EYESIGHT NOT THE LATTER CERTAINLY FOR THE FIGURE WAS NOW EMERGING AGAIN MOTIONING TO HER AS BEFORE
1066-5330-0003 AND A CRY ESCAPED HER TELLING MORE OF SORROW THAN OF JOY THOUGH BETRAYING BOTH SHE PENETRATED THE TREES AND BURST INTO TEARS AS ONE IN THE DRESS OF A FARM LABORER CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS
1066-5330-0004 IN SPITE OF HIS SMOCK FROCK AND HIS STRAW WISPED HAT AND HIS FALSE WHISKERS BLACK AS EREBUS SHE KNEW HIM FOR HER BROTHER OH RICHARD WHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE DID YOU KNOW ME BARBARA WAS HIS REJOINDER
1066-5330-0005 SHOULD MAMMA SEE YOU IT WILL KILL HER OUTRIGHT I CAN'T LIVE ON AS I AM LIVING HE ANSWERED GLOOMILY I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN LONDON EVER SINCE IN LONDON INTERRUPTED BARBARA IN LONDON AND HAVE NEVER STIRRED OUT OF IT
1066-5330-0006 A STABLE YARD SHE UTTERED IN A DEEPLY SHOCKED TONE RICHARD DID YOU EXPECT IT WOULD BE AS A MERCHANT OR A BANKER OR PERHAPS AS SECRETARY TO ONE OF HER MAJESTY'S MINISTERS OR THAT I WAS A GENTLEMAN AT LARGE LIVING ON MY FORTUNE
1066-5330-0007 RETORTED RICHARD HARE IN A TONE OF CHAFED ANGUISH PAINFUL TO HEAR I GET TWELVE SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THAT HAS TO FIND ME IN EVERYTHING POOR RICHARD POOR RICHARD SHE WAILED CARESSING HIS HAND AND WEEPING OVER IT
1066-5330-0008 OH WHAT A MISERABLE NIGHT'S WORK THAT WAS OUR ONLY COMFORT IS RICHARD THAT YOU MUST HAVE COMMITTED THE DEED IN MADNESS I DID NOT COMMIT IT AT ALL HE REPLIED WHAT SHE EXCLAIMED
1066-5330-0009 BARBARA I SWEAR THAT I AM INNOCENT I SWEAR I WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN THE MAN WAS MURDERED I SWEAR THAT FROM MY OWN POSITIVE KNOWLEDGE MY EYESIGHT I KNOW NO MORE WHO DID IT THAN YOU
1066-5330-0010 THE GUESSING AT IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME AND MY GUESS IS AS SURE AND TRUE A ONE AS THAT THE MOON IS IN THE HEAVENS BARBARA SHIVERED AS SHE DREW CLOSE TO HIM IT WAS A SHIVERING SUBJECT YOU SURELY DO NOT MEAN TO THROW THE GUILT ON BETHEL
1066-5330-0011 BETHEL LIGHTLY RETURNED RICHARD HARE HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT HE WAS AFTER HIS GINS AND HIS SNARES THAT NIGHT THOUGH POACHER AS HE IS BETHEL IS NO POACHER RICHARD IS HE NOT
1066-5330-0012 REJOINED RICHARD HARE SIGNIFICANTLY THE TRUTH AS TO WHAT HE IS MAY COME OUT SOME TIME NOT THAT I WISH IT TO COME OUT THE MAN HAS DONE NO HARM TO ME AND HE MAY GO ON POACHING WITH IMPUNITY TILL DOOMSDAY FOR ALL I CARE HE AND LOCKSLEY
1066-5330-0013 RICHARD INTERRUPTED HIS SISTER IN A HUSHED VOICE MAMMA ENTERTAINS ONE FIXED IDEA WHICH SHE CANNOT PUT FROM HER SHE IS CERTAIN THAT BETHEL HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER THEN SHE IS WRONG WHY SHOULD SHE THINK SO
1066-5330-0014 BUT YOU REMEMBER HOW WEAK AND FANCIFUL SHE IS AND SINCE THAT DREADFUL NIGHT SHE IS ALWAYS HAVING WHAT SHE CALLS DREAMS' MEANING THAT SHE DREAMS OF THE MURDER IN ALL THESE DREAMS BETHEL IS PROMINENT
1066-5330-0015 AND SHE SAYS SHE FEELS AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT HE WAS IN SOME WAY OR OTHER MIXED UP IN IT BARBARA HE WAS NO MORE MIXED UP IN IT THAN YOU AND YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE NOT
1066-5330-0016 I WAS NOT EVEN AT THE COTTAGE AT THE TIME I SWEAR IT TO YOU THE MAN WHO DID THE DEED WAS THORN THORN ECHOED BARBARA LIFTING HER HEAD WHO IS THORN I DON'T KNOW WHO
1066-5330-0017 WELL RETURNED RICHARD IT WAS NOT TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS THAT I PUT MYSELF IN JEOPARDY AND TO ASSERT MY INNOCENCE CAN DO NO GOOD IT CANNOT SET ASIDE THE CORONER'S VERDICT OF WILFUL MURDER AGAINST RICHARD HARE THE YOUNGER
1066-5330-0018 IS MY FATHER AS BITTER AGAINST ME AS EVER QUITE HE NEVER MENTIONS YOUR NAME OR SUFFERS IT TO BE MENTIONED
1066-5330-0019 ELIZA COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT REMEMBER AND SHE PERSISTED IN CALLING YOUR ROOM MISTER RICHARD'S I THINK THE WOMAN DID IT HEEDLESSLY NOT MALICIOUSLY TO PROVOKE PAPA SHE WAS A GOOD SERVANT AND HAD BEEN WITH US THREE YEARS YOU KNOW
1066-5330-0020 THE FIRST TIME SHE TRANSGRESSED PAPA WARNED HER THE SECOND HE THUNDERED AT HER AS I BELIEVE NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN THUNDER AND THE THIRD HE TURNED HER FROM THE DOORS NEVER ALLOWING HER TO GET HER BONNET
1066-5330-0021 ONE OF THE OTHERS CARRYING HER BONNET AND SHAWL TO THE GATE AND HER BOXES WERE SENT AWAY THE SAME DAY PAPA TOOK AN OATH DID YOU HEAR OF IT WHAT OATH HE TAKES MANY THIS WAS A SOLEMN ONE RICHARD
1066-5330-0022 AFTER THE DELIVERY OF THE VERDICT HE TOOK AN OATH IN THE JUSTICE ROOM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS BROTHER MAGISTRATES THAT IF HE COULD FIND YOU HE WOULD DELIVER YOU UP TO JUSTICE AND THAT HE WOULD DO IT THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT TURN UP FOR TEN YEARS TO COME
1066-5330-0023 YOU KNOW HIS DISPOSITION RICHARD AND THEREFORE MAY BE SURE HE WILL KEEP IT INDEED IT IS MOST DANGEROUS FOR YOU TO BE HERE I KNOW THAT HE NEVER TREATED ME AS HE OUGHT CRIED RICHARD BITTERLY
1066-5330-0024 IF MY HEALTH WAS DELICATE CAUSING MY POOR MOTHER TO INDULGE ME OUGHT THAT TO HAVE BEEN A REASON FOR HIS RIDICULING ME ON EVERY POSSIBLE OCCASION PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HAD MY HOME BEEN MADE HAPPIER I SHOULD NOT HAVE SOUGHT THE SOCIETY I DID ELSEWHERE
1066-5330-0025 BARBARA I MUST BE ALLOWED AN INTERVIEW WITH MY MOTHER BARBARA HARE REFLECTED BEFORE SHE SPOKE I DO NOT SEE HOW IT CAN BE MANAGED WHY CAN'T SHE COME OUT TO ME AS YOU HAVE DONE IS SHE UP OR IN BED
1066-5330-0026 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK OF IT TO NIGHT RETURNED BARBARA IN AN ALARMED TONE
1066-5330-0027 IT IS HARD TO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM HER FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND TO GO BACK WITHOUT SEEING HER RETURNED RICHARD AND ABOUT THE MONEY IT IS A HUNDRED POUNDS THAT I WANT YOU MUST BE HERE AGAIN TO MORROW NIGHT RICHARD
1066-5330-0028 THE MONEY NO DOUBT CAN BE YOURS BUT I AM NOT SO SURE ABOUT YOUR SEEING MAMMA I AM TERRIFIED FOR YOUR SAFETY BUT IF IT IS AS YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT SHE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE COULD IT NOT BE PROVED
1066-5330-0029 ARE YOU AND I MYTHS RETORTED RICHARD SO EVEN YOU DOUBT ME RICHARD SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED WHY NOT TELL THE WHOLE CIRCUMSTANCES TO ARCHIBALD CARLYLE
1066-5330-0030 IF ANY ONE CAN HELP YOU OR TAKE MEASURES TO ESTABLISH YOUR INNOCENCE HE CAN AND YOU KNOW THAT HE IS TRUE AS STEEL THERE'S NO OTHER MAN LIVING SHOULD BE TRUSTED WITH THE SECRET THAT I AM HERE EXCEPT CARLYLE WHERE IS IT THEY SUPPOSE THAT I AM BARBARA
1066-5330-0031 SOME THAT YOU ARE IN AUSTRALIA THE VERY UNCERTAINTY HAS NEARLY KILLED MAMMA
1066-5330-0032 BESIDES A MAN THAT THE POLICE RUNNERS WERE AFTER COULD BE MORE SAFE IN OBSCURITY CONSIDERING THAT HE WAS A GENTLEMAN THAN BARBARA TURNED SUDDENLY AND PLACED HER HAND UPON HER BROTHER'S MOUTH BE SILENT FOR YOUR LIFE SHE WHISPERED HERE'S PAPA
1066-5330-0033 VOICES WERE HEARD APPROACHING THE GATE THOSE OF JUSTICE HARE AND SQUIRE PINNER THE LATTER WALKED ON THE FORMER CAME IN THE BROTHER AND SISTER COWERED TOGETHER SCARCELY DARING TO BREATHE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD BARBARA'S HEART BEATING
1066-5330-0034 MISTER HARE CLOSED THE GATE AND WALKED ON UP THE PATH I MUST GO RICHARD SAID BARBARA HASTILY I DARE NOT STAY ANOTHER MINUTE BE HERE AGAIN TO MORROW NIGHT AND MEANWHILE I WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
1066-5330-0035 SHE WAS SPEEDING AWAY BUT RICHARD HELD HER BACK YOU DID NOT SEEM TO BELIEVE MY ASSERTION OF INNOCENCE BARBARA WE ARE HERE ALONE IN THE STILL NIGHT WITH GOD ABOVE US AS TRULY AS THAT YOU AND I MUST SOMETIME MEET HIM FACE TO FACE I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH
