1679-142280-0000 CHAPTER SIX FAREWELL UNWATCH'D THE GARDEN BOUGH SHALL SWAY THE TENDER BLOSSOM FLUTTER DOWN UNLOVED THAT BEECH WILL GATHER BROWN
1679-142280-0001 THE MAPLE BURN ITSELF AWAY UNLOVED THE SUN FLOWER SHINING FAIR RAY ROUND WITH FLAMES HER DISK OF SEED AND MANY A ROSE CARNATION FEED WITH SUMMER SPICE THE HUMMING AIR
1679-142280-0002 TILL FROM THE GARDEN AND THE WILD A FRESH ASSOCIATION BLOW AND YEAR BY YEAR THE LANDSCAPE GROW FAMILIAR TO THE STRANGER'S CHILD AS YEAR BY YEAR THE LABOURER TILLS HIS WONTED GLEBE OR LOPS THE GLADES
1679-142280-0003 AND YEAR BY YEAR OUR MEMORY FADES FROM ALL THE CIRCLE OF THE HILLS TENNYSON THE LAST DAY CAME THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF PACKING CASES
1679-142280-0004 EVEN THE PRETTY LAWN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS MADE UNSIGHTLY AND UNTIDY BY THE STRAW THAT HAD BEEN WAFTED UPON IT THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AND WINDOWS THE ROOMS HAD A STRANGE ECHOING SOUND IN THEM AND THE LIGHT CAME HARSHLY AND STRONGLY IN THROUGH THE UNCURTAINED WINDOWS
1679-142280-0005 SEEMING ALREADY UNFAMILIAR AND STRANGE MISSUS HALE'S DRESSING ROOM WAS LEFT UNTOUCHED TO THE LAST AND THERE SHE AND DIXON WERE PACKING UP CLOTHES AND INTERRUPTING EACH OTHER EVERY NOW AND THEN TO EXCLAIM AT AND TURN OVER WITH FOND REGARD
1679-142280-0006 THEY DID NOT MAKE MUCH PROGRESS WITH THEIR WORK DOWN STAIRS MARGARET STOOD CALM AND COLLECTED
1679-142280-0007 THESE TWO LAST CRYING BETWEEN WHILES WONDERED HOW THE YOUNG LADY COULD KEEP UP SO THIS LAST DAY AND SETTLED IT BETWEEN THEM THAT SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO CARE MUCH FOR HELSTONE HAVING BEEN SO LONG IN LONDON THERE SHE STOOD
1679-142280-0008 VERY PALE AND QUIET WITH HER LARGE GRAVE EYES OBSERVING EVERYTHING UP TO EVERY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER SMALL THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HER HEART WAS ACHING ALL THE TIME
1679-142280-0009 WITH A HEAVY PRESSURE THAT NO SIGHS COULD LIFT OFF OR RELIEVE AND HOW CONSTANT EXERTION FOR HER PERCEPTIVE FACULTIES WAS THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP HERSELF FROM CRYING OUT WITH PAIN MOREOVER IF SHE GAVE WAY WHO WAS TO ACT
1679-142280-0010 HER FATHER WAS EXAMINING PAPERS BOOKS REGISTERS WHAT NOT IN THE VESTRY WITH THE CLERK AND WHEN HE CAME IN THERE WERE HIS OWN BOOKS TO PACK UP WHICH NO ONE BUT HIMSELF COULD DO TO HIS SATISFACTION
1679-142280-0011 BESIDES WAS MARGARET ONE TO GIVE WAY BEFORE STRANGE MEN OR EVEN HOUSEHOLD FRIENDS LIKE THE COOK AND CHARLOTTE NOT SHE BUT AT LAST THE FOUR PACKERS WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO THEIR TEA
1679-142280-0012 OUT THROUGH THE BARE ECHOING DRAWING ROOM INTO THE TWILIGHT OF AN EARLY NOVEMBER EVENING THERE WAS A FILMY VEIL OF SOFT DULL MIST OBSCURING BUT NOT HIDING ALL OBJECTS
1679-142280-0013 GIVING THEM A LILAC HUE FOR THE SUN HAD NOT YET FULLY SET A ROBIN WAS SINGING PERHAPS MARGARET THOUGHT THE VERY ROBIN THAT HER FATHER HAD SO OFTEN TALKED OF AS HIS WINTER PET AND FOR WHICH HE HAD MADE WITH HIS OWN HANDS
1679-142280-0014 A KIND OF ROBIN HOUSE BY HIS STUDY WINDOW THE LEAVES WERE MORE GORGEOUS THAN EVER THE FIRST TOUCH OF FROST WOULD LAY THEM ALL LOW ON THE GROUND
1679-142280-0015 MARGARET WENT ALONG THE WALK UNDER THE PEAR TREE WALL SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ALONG IT SINCE SHE PACED IT AT HENRY LENNOX'S SIDE HERE AT THIS BED OF THYME HE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF WHAT SHE MUST NOT THINK OF NOW
1679-142280-0016 HER EYES WERE ON THAT LATE BLOWING ROSE AS SHE WAS TRYING TO ANSWER
1679-142280-0017 OF THE CARROTS IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF HIS LAST SENTENCE ONLY A FORTNIGHT AGO AND ALL SO CHANGED
1679-142280-0018 AND FRESHENING HIMSELF UP AS HE HAD TOLD HER HE OFTEN DID BY A RUN IN THE TEMPLE GARDENS TAKING IN THE WHILE THE GRAND INARTICULATE MIGHTY ROAR OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BUSY MEN NIGH AT HAND BUT NOT SEEN
1679-142280-0019 HE HAD OFTEN SPOKEN TO MARGARET OF THESE HASTY WALKS SNATCHED IN THE INTERVALS BETWEEN STUDY AND DINNER
1679-142280-0020 AND THE THOUGHT OF THEM HAD STRUCK UPON HER FANCY HERE THERE WAS NO SOUND THE ROBIN HAD GONE AWAY INTO THE VAST STILLNESS OF NIGHT NOW AND THEN A COTTAGE DOOR IN THE DISTANCE WAS OPENED AND SHUT
1679-142280-0021 AS IF TO ADMIT THE TIRED LABOURER TO HIS HOME BUT THAT SOUNDED VERY FAR AWAY A STEALTHY CREEPING CRANCHING SOUND AMONG THE CRISP FALLEN LEAVES OF THE FOREST BEYOND THE GARDEN SEEMED ALMOST CLOSE AT HAND
1679-142280-0022 MARGARET KNEW IT WAS SOME POACHER SITTING UP IN HER BED ROOM THIS PAST AUTUMN WITH THE LIGHT OF HER CANDLE EXTINGUISHED AND PURELY REVELLING IN THE SOLEMN BEAUTY OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH SHE HAD MANY A TIME SEEN THE LIGHT NOISELESS LEAP OF THE POACHERS
1679-142280-0023 OVER THE GARDEN FENCE THEIR QUICK TRAMP ACROSS THE DEWY MOONLIT LAWN THEIR DISAPPEARANCE IN THE BLACK STILL SHADOW BEYOND THE WILD ADVENTUROUS FREEDOM OF THEIR LIFE HAD TAKEN HER FANCY SHE FELT INCLINED TO WISH THEM SUCCESS
1679-142280-0024 SHE HAD NO FEAR OF THEM BUT TO NIGHT SHE WAS AFRAID SHE KNEW NOT WHY SHE HEARD CHARLOTTE SHUTTING THE WINDOWS AND FASTENING UP FOR THE NIGHT UNCONSCIOUS THAT ANY ONE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE GARDEN A SMALL BRANCH IT MIGHT BE OF ROTTEN WOOD
1679-142280-0025 OR IT MIGHT BE BROKEN BY FORCE CAME HEAVILY DOWN IN THE NEAREST PART OF THE FOREST MARGARET RAN SWIFT AS CAMILLA DOWN TO THE WINDOW AND RAPPED AT IT WITH A HURRIED TREMULOUSNESS WHICH STARTLED CHARLOTTE WITHIN LET ME IN LET ME IN IT IS ONLY ME CHARLOTTE
1679-142280-0026 WITH THE WINDOWS FASTENED AND BOLTED AND THE FAMILIAR WALLS HEMMING HER ROUND AND SHUTTING HER IN SHE HAD SATE DOWN UPON A PACKING CASE CHEERLESS CHILL WAS THE DREARY AND DISMANTLED ROOM NO FIRE
1679-142280-0027 NOR OTHER LIGHT BUT CHARLOTTE'S LONG UNSNUFFED CANDLE CHARLOTTE LOOKED AT MARGARET WITH SURPRISE AND MARGARET FEELING IT RATHER THAN SEEING IT ROSE UP I WAS AFRAID YOU WERE SHUTTING ME OUT ALTOGETHER CHARLOTTE
1679-142280-0028 SAID SHE HALF SMILING AND THEN YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD ME IN THE KITCHEN AND THE DOORS INTO THE LANE AND CHURCHYARD ARE LOCKED LONG AGO OH MISS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SURE TO HAVE MISSED YOU SOON

1679-142280-0030 I SHALL BE SURE AND SEND YOU MY ADDRESS WHEN I KNOW IT THE STUDY WAS ALL READY FOR TEA THERE WAS A GOOD BLAZING FIRE AND UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE MARGARET SAT DOWN ON THE RUG
1679-142280-0031 PARTLY TO WARM HERSELF FOR THE DAMPNESS OF THE EVENING HUNG ABOUT HER DRESS AND OVER FATIGUE HAD MADE HER CHILLY SHE KEPT HERSELF BALANCED BY CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER ROUND HER KNEES HER HEAD DROPPED A LITTLE TOWARDS HER CHEST
1679-142280-0032 THE ATTITUDE WAS ONE OF DESPONDENCY WHATEVER HER FRAME OF MIND MIGHT BE BUT WHEN SHE HEARD HER FATHER'S STEP ON THE GRAVEL OUTSIDE SHE STARTED UP AND HASTILY SHAKING HER HEAVY BLACK HAIR BACK
1679-142280-0033 AND WIPING A FEW TEARS AWAY THAT HAD COME ON HER CHEEKS SHE KNEW NOT HOW SHE WENT OUT TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR HIM HE SHOWED FAR MORE DEPRESSION THAN SHE DID SHE COULD HARDLY GET HIM TO TALK
1679-142280-0034 ALTHOUGH SHE TRIED TO SPEAK ON SUBJECTS THAT WOULD INTEREST HIM AT THE COST OF AN EFFORT EVERY TIME WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD BE HER LAST HAVE YOU BEEN A VERY LONG WALK TO DAY ASKED SHE ON SEEING HIS REFUSAL TO TOUCH FOOD OF ANY KIND
1679-142280-0035 AS FAR AS FORDHAM BEECHES I WENT TO SEE WIDOW MALTBY SHE IS SADLY GRIEVED AT NOT HAVING WISHED YOU GOOD BYE SHE SAYS LITTLE SUSAN HAS KEPT WATCH DOWN THE LANE FOR DAYS PAST
1679-142280-0036 NAY MARGARET WHAT IS THE MATTER DEAR THE THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE CHILD WATCHING FOR HER AND CONTINUALLY DISAPPOINTED FROM NO FORGETFULNESS ON HER PART BUT FROM SHEER INABILITY TO LEAVE HOME WAS THE LAST DROP IN POOR MARGARET'S CUP
1679-142280-0037 MISTER HALE WAS DISTRESSINGLY PERPLEXED HE ROSE AND WALKED NERVOUSLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM MARGARET TRIED TO CHECK HERSELF BUT WOULD NOT SPEAK UNTIL SHE COULD DO SO WITH FIRMNESS SHE HEARD HIM TALKING AS IF TO HIMSELF
1679-142280-0038 I CANNOT BEAR IT I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS I THINK I COULD GO THROUGH MY OWN WITH PATIENCE OH IS THERE NO GOING BACK NO FATHER SAID MARGARET LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM AND SPEAKING LOW AND STEADILY
1679-142280-0039 IT IS BAD TO BELIEVE YOU IN ERROR IT WOULD BE INFINITELY WORSE TO HAVE KNOWN YOU A HYPOCRITE
1679-142280-0040 SAVOURED OF IRREVERENCE BESIDES SHE WENT ON IT IS ONLY THAT I AM TIRED TO NIGHT DON'T THINK THAT I AM SUFFERING FROM WHAT YOU HAVE DONE DEAR PAPA WE CAN'T EITHER OF US TALK ABOUT IT TO NIGHT I BELIEVE SAID SHE
1679-142280-0041 FINDING THAT TEARS AND SOBS WOULD COME IN SPITE OF HERSELF I HAD BETTER GO AND TAKE MAMMA UP THIS CUP OF TEA SHE HAD HERS VERY EARLY
1679-142280-0042 RAILROAD TIME INEXORABLY WRENCHED THEM AWAY FROM LOVELY BELOVED HELSTONE THE NEXT MORNING THEY WERE GONE
1679-142280-0043 MORE HOMELIKE THAN EVER IN THE MORNING SUN THAT GLITTERED ON ITS WINDOWS EACH BELONGING TO SOME WELL LOVED ROOM ALMOST BEFORE THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES INTO THE CAR SENT FROM SOUTHAMPTON TO FETCH THEM TO THE STATION THEY WERE GONE AWAY TO RETURN NO MORE
1679-142280-0044 A STING AT MARGARET'S HEART MADE HER STRIVE TO LOOK OUT TO CATCH THE LAST GLIMPSE OF THE OLD CHURCH TOWER AT THE TURN WHERE SHE KNEW IT MIGHT BE SEEN ABOVE A WAVE OF THE FOREST TREES
1679-142280-0045 BUT HER FATHER REMEMBERED THIS TOO AND SHE SILENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GREATER RIGHT TO THE ONE WINDOW FROM WHICH IT COULD BE SEEN
1679-142280-0046 ON THE SHADOWING EYE LASHES BEFORE ROLLING SLOWLY DOWN HER CHEEKS AND DROPPING UNHEEDED ON HER DRESS THEY WERE TO STOP IN LONDON ALL NIGHT AT SOME QUIET HOTEL POOR MISSUS HALE HAD CRIED IN HER WAY NEARLY ALL DAY LONG
1679-142280-0047 AND DIXON SHOWED HER SORROW BY EXTREME CROSSNESS AND A CONTINUAL IRRITABLE ATTEMPT TO KEEP HER PETTICOATS FROM EVEN TOUCHING THE UNCONSCIOUS MISTER HALE WHOM SHE REGARDED AS THE ORIGIN OF ALL THIS SUFFERING
1679-142280-0048 THEY WENT THROUGH THE WELL KNOWN STREETS PAST HOUSES WHICH THEY HAD OFTEN VISITED
1679-142280-0049 IMPATIENT BY HER AUNT'S SIDE WHILE THAT LADY WAS MAKING SOME IMPORTANT AND INTERMINABLE DECISION NAY ABSOLUTELY PAST ACQUAINTANCES IN THE STREETS FOR THOUGH THE MORNING HAD BEEN OF AN INCALCULABLE LENGTH TO THEM
1679-142280-0050 AND THEY FELT AS IF IT OUGHT LONG AGO TO HAVE CLOSED IN FOR THE REPOSE OF DARKNESS IT WAS THE VERY BUSIEST TIME OF A LONDON AFTERNOON IN NOVEMBER WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE IT WAS LONG SINCE MISSUS HALE HAD BEEN IN LONDON
1679-142280-0051 AND SHE ROUSED UP ALMOST LIKE A CHILD TO LOOK ABOUT HER AT THE DIFFERENT STREETS AND TO GAZE AFTER AND EXCLAIM AT THE SHOPS AND CARRIAGES OH THERE'S HARRISON'S WHERE I BOUGHT SO MANY OF MY WEDDING THINGS DEAR HOW ALTERED
1679-142280-0052 THEY'VE GOT IMMENSE PLATE GLASS WINDOWS LARGER THAN CRAWFORD'S IN SOUTHAMPTON OH AND THERE I DECLARE NO
1679-142280-0053 MARGARET STARTED FORWARDS AND AS QUICKLY FELL BACK HALF SMILING AT HERSELF FOR THE SUDDEN MOTION THEY WERE A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY BY THIS TIME BUT HE SEEMED LIKE A RELIC OF HELSTONE HE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A BRIGHT MORNING AN EVENTFUL DAY
1679-142280-0054 THE EVENING WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT PASSED IN A ROOM HIGH UP IN AN HOTEL WAS LONG AND HEAVY
1679-142280-0055 EVERY ONE THEY SAW EITHER IN THE HOUSE OR OUT IN THE STREETS APPEARED HURRYING TO SOME APPOINTMENT EXPECTED BY OR EXPECTING SOMEBODY THEY ALONE SEEMED STRANGE AND FRIENDLESS AND DESOLATE
1679-142280-0056 YET WITHIN A MILE MARGARET KNEW OF HOUSE AFTER HOUSE WHERE SHE FOR HER OWN SAKE AND HER MOTHER FOR HER AUNT SHAW'S WOULD BE WELCOMED IF THEY CAME IN GLADNESS OR EVEN IN PEACE OF MIND
1679-142280-0057 THEN THEY WOULD BE FELT AS A SHADOW IN ALL THESE HOUSES OF INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES NOT FRIENDS
1679-142280-0058 WHICH THE FRIENDS OF JOB SHOWED WHEN THEY SAT WITH HIM ON THE GROUND SEVEN DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS AND NONE SPAKE A WORD UNTO HIM
