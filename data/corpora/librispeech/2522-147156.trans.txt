2522-147156-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN JEM'S INTERVIEW WITH POOR ESTHER KNOW THE TEMPTATION ERE YOU JUDGE THE CRIME LOOK ON THIS TREE
2522-147156-0001 YET NOW SAVE THESE FEW SHOOTS HOW DRY AND ROTTEN THOU CANST NOT TELL THE CAUSE NOT LONG AGO A NEIGHBOUR OAK WITH WHICH ITS ROOTS WERE TWINED
2522-147156-0002 IN FALLING WRENCHED THEM WITH SUCH CRUEL FORCE THAT THOUGH WE COVERED THEM AGAIN WITH CARE ITS BEAUTY WITHERED AND IT PINED AWAY SO COULD WE LOOK INTO THE HUMAN BREAST HOW OFT THE FATAL BLIGHT THAT MEETS OUR VIEW
2522-147156-0003 SHOULD WE TRACE DOWN TO THE TORN BLEEDING FIBRES OF A TOO TRUSTING HEART WHERE IT WERE SHAME FOR PITYING TEARS TO GIVE CONTEMPT OR BLAME STREET WALKS THE MONTH WAS OVER
2522-147156-0004 THE HONEYMOON TO THE NEWLY MARRIED THE EXQUISITE CONVALESCENCE TO THE LIVING MOTHER OF A LIVING CHILD THE FIRST DARK DAYS OF NOTHINGNESS TO THE WIDOW AND THE CHILD BEREAVED THE TERM OF PENANCE OF HARD LABOUR
2522-147156-0005 SICK AND IN PRISON AND YE VISITED ME SHALL YOU OR I RECEIVE SUCH BLESSING
2522-147156-0006 FROM THE ONLY SHELTER SHE COULD MEET WITH HOUSELESS AND PENNYLESS AS SHE WAS ON THAT DREARY DAY BUT IT WAS BUT FOR AN INSTANT THAT SHE STOOD THERE DOUBTING ONE THOUGHT HAD HAUNTED HER BOTH BY NIGHT AND BY DAY
2522-147156-0007 WITH MONOMANIACAL INCESSANCY AND THAT THOUGHT WAS HOW TO SAVE MARY HER DEAD SISTER'S ONLY CHILD HER OWN LITTLE PET IN THE DAYS OF HER INNOCENCE FROM FOLLOWING IN THE SAME DOWNWARD PATH TO VICE
2522-147156-0008 TO WHOM COULD SHE SPEAK AND ASK FOR AID SHE SHRANK FROM THE IDEA OF ADDRESSING JOHN BARTON AGAIN HER HEART SANK WITHIN HER AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS FIERCE REPULSING ACTION AND FAR FIERCER WORDS
2522-147156-0009 IT SEEMED WORSE THAN DEATH TO REVEAL HER CONDITION TO MARY ELSE SHE SOMETIMES THOUGHT THAT THIS COURSE WOULD BE THE MOST TERRIBLE THE MOST EFFICIENT WARNING SHE MUST SPEAK TO THAT SHE WAS SOUL COMPELLED BUT TO WHOM
2522-147156-0010 SHE DREADED ADDRESSING ANY OF HER FORMER FEMALE ACQUAINTANCE EVEN SUPPOSING THEY HAD SENSE OR SPIRIT OR INTEREST ENOUGH TO UNDERTAKE HER MISSION TO WHOM SHALL THE OUTCAST PROSTITUTE TELL HER TALE
2522-147156-0011 WHO WILL GIVE HER HELP IN HER DAY OF NEED HERS IS THE LEPER SIN AND ALL STAND ALOOF DREADING TO BE COUNTED UNCLEAN IN HER WILD NIGHT WANDERINGS
2522-147156-0012 YOU MAY EASILY IMAGINE THAT A DOUBLE INTEREST WAS ATTACHED BY HER TO THE WAYS AND COMPANIONSHIPS OF THOSE WITH WHOM SHE HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED IN THE DAYS WHICH WHEN PRESENT
2522-147156-0013 BUT WHICH NOW IN RETROSPECTION SEEMED SO HAPPY AND UNCLOUDED ACCORDINGLY SHE HAD AS WE HAVE SEEN KNOWN WHERE TO MEET WITH JOHN BARTON ON THAT UNFORTUNATE NIGHT WHICH HAD ONLY PRODUCED IRRITATION IN HIM AND A MONTH'S IMPRISONMENT TO HER
2522-147156-0014 SHE HAD SEEN HIM WALKING AND TALKING WITH BOTH FATHER AND SON HER OLD FRIENDS TOO AND SHE HAD SHED UNREGARDED UNVALUED TEARS WHEN SOME ONE HAD CASUALLY TOLD HER OF GEORGE WILSON'S SUDDEN DEATH
2522-147156-0015 IT NOW FLASHED ACROSS HER MIND THAT TO THE SON TO MARY'S PLAY FELLOW HER ELDER BROTHER IN THE DAYS OF CHILDHOOD HER TALE MIGHT BE TOLD
2522-147156-0016 ALL THESE THOUGHTS HAD PASSED THROUGH HER MIND WHILE YET SHE WAS IN PRISON SO WHEN SHE WAS TURNED OUT HER PURPOSE WAS CLEAR AND SHE DID NOT FEEL HER DESOLATION OF FREEDOM AS SHE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE THAT NIGHT
2522-147156-0017 SHE STATIONED HERSELF EARLY NEAR THE FOUNDRY WHERE SHE KNEW JEM WORKED HE STAYED LATER THAN USUAL BEING DETAINED BY SOME ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MORROW SHE GREW TIRED AND IMPATIENT
2522-147156-0018 MANY WORKMEN HAD COME OUT OF THE DOOR IN THE LONG DEAD BRICK WALL AND EAGERLY HAD SHE PEERED INTO THEIR FACES DEAF TO ALL INSULT OR CURSE HE MUST HAVE GONE HOME EARLY ONE MORE TURN IN THE STREET AND SHE WOULD GO
2522-147156-0019 DURING THAT TURN HE CAME OUT AND IN THE QUIET OF THAT STREET OF WORKSHOPS AND WAREHOUSES SHE DIRECTLY HEARD HIS STEPS
2522-147156-0020 BUT STILL SHE WAS NOT DAUNTED FROM HER PURPOSE PAINFUL AS ITS FULFILMENT WAS SURE TO BE SHE LAID HER HAND ON HIS ARM AS SHE EXPECTED
2522-147156-0021 AFTER A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT THE PERSON WHO THUS ENDEAVOURED TO DETAIN HIM HE MADE AN EFFORT TO SHAKE IT OFF AND PASS ON BUT TREMBLING AS SHE WAS
2522-147156-0022 YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME JEM WILSON SHE SAID WITH ALMOST AN ACCENT OF COMMAND GO AWAY MISSIS I'VE NOUGHT TO DO WITH YOU EITHER IN HEARKENING OR TALKING HE MADE ANOTHER STRUGGLE YOU MUST LISTEN
2522-147156-0023 SHE SAID AGAIN AUTHORITATIVELY FOR MARY BARTON'S SAKE THE SPELL OF HER NAME WAS AS POTENT AS THAT OF THE MARINER'S GLITTERING EYE HE LISTENED LIKE A THREE YEAR CHILD
2522-147156-0024 HE INTERRUPTED HIS EARNEST GAZE INTO HER FACE WITH THE EXCLAMATION AND WHO CAN YO BE TO KNOW MARY BARTON OR TO KNOW THAT SHE'S OUGHT TO ME
2522-147156-0025 THERE WAS A LITTLE STRIFE IN ESTHER'S MIND FOR AN INSTANT BETWEEN THE SHAME OF ACKNOWLEDGING HERSELF AND THE ADDITIONAL WEIGHT TO HER REVELATION WHICH SUCH ACKNOWLEDGMENT WOULD GIVE THEN SHE SPOKE DO YOU REMEMBER ESTHER
2522-147156-0026 THE SISTER OF JOHN BARTON'S WIFE THE AUNT TO MARY AND THE VALENTINE I SENT YOU LAST FEBRUARY TEN YEARS YES I MIND HER WELL BUT YO ARE NOT ESTHER ARE YOU HE LOOKED AGAIN INTO HER FACE
2522-147156-0027 AND SEEING THAT INDEED IT WAS HIS BOYHOOD'S FRIEND HE TOOK HER HAND AND SHOOK IT WITH A CORDIALITY THAT FORGOT THE PRESENT IN THE PAST WHY ESTHER
2522-147156-0028 THE QUESTION WAS ASKED THOUGHTLESSLY BUT ANSWERED WITH FIERCE EARNESTNESS WHERE HAVE I BEEN WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING WHY DO YOU TORMENT ME WITH QUESTIONS LIKE THESE CAN YOU NOT GUESS
2522-147156-0029 AFTERWARDS I WILL TELL IT YOU NAY DON'T CHANGE YOUR FICKLE MIND NOW AND SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT YOU MUST HEAR IT AND I MUST TELL IT AND THEN SEE AFTER MARY AND TAKE CARE SHE DOES NOT BECOME LIKE ME AS SHE IS LOVING NOW
2522-147156-0030 SO DID I LOVE ONCE ONE ABOVE ME FAR SHE REMARKED NOT IN HER OWN ABSORPTION THE CHANGE IN JEM'S BREATHING THE SUDDEN CLUTCH AT THE WALL WHICH TOLD THE FEARFULLY VIVID INTEREST HE TOOK IN WHAT SHE SAID
2522-147156-0031 HE WAS SO HANDSOME SO KIND WELL THE REGIMENT WAS ORDERED TO CHESTER DID I TELL YOU HE WAS AN OFFICER AND HE COULD NOT BEAR TO PART FROM ME NOR I FROM HIM
2522-147156-0032 I NEVER THOUGHT POOR MARY WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT SO TO HEART
2522-147156-0033 THEY ALL DO THEN CAME THREE YEARS OF HAPPINESS
2522-147156-0034 BUT I WAS I HAD A LITTLE GIRL TOO OH THE SWEETEST DARLING THAT EVER WAS SEEN BUT I MUST NOT THINK OF HER PUTTING HER HAND WILDLY UP TO HER FOREHEAD OR I SHALL GO MAD I SHALL
2522-147156-0035 DON'T TELL ME ANY MORE ABOUT YOURSEL SAID JEM SOOTHINGLY WHAT YOU'RE TIRED ALREADY ARE YOU
2522-147156-0036 YOU SHALL HEAR IT I WON'T RECALL THE AGONY OF THE PAST FOR NOTHING I WILL HAVE THE RELIEF OF TELLING IT
2522-147156-0037 SINKING HER VOICE INTO A PLAINTIVE CHILD LIKE MANNER
2522-147156-0038 AND MUST LEAVE ME BEHIND AT BRISTOL WE THEN WERE JEM MUTTERED SOME WORDS SHE CAUGHT THEIR MEANING AND IN A PLEADING VOICE CONTINUED OH DON'T ABUSE HIM DON'T SPEAK A WORD AGAINST HIM
2522-147156-0039 YOU DON'T GUESS HOW KIND HE WAS HE GAVE ME FIFTY POUND BEFORE WE PARTED AND I KNEW HE COULD ILL SPARE IT DON'T JEM PLEASE AS HIS MUTTERED INDIGNATION ROSE AGAIN FOR HER SAKE HE CEASED
2522-147156-0040 I MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER WITH THE MONEY I SEE NOW
2522-147156-0041 FORMERLY I HAD EARNED IT EASILY ENOUGH AT THE FACTORY
2522-147156-0042 WHILE I LIVED WITH HIM I HAD IT FOR ASKING AND FIFTY POUNDS WOULD I THOUGHT GO A LONG WAY SO I WENT BACK TO CHESTER WHERE I'D BEEN SO HAPPY AND SET UP A SMALL WARE SHOP AND HIRED A ROOM NEAR WE SHOULD HAVE DONE WELL
2522-147156-0043 BUT ALAS ALAS MY LITTLE GIRL FELL ILL AND I COULD NOT MIND MY SHOP AND HER TOO AND THINGS GREW WORSE AND WORSE
2522-147156-0044 I WROTE OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HER FATHER FOR HELP BUT HE MUST HAVE CHANGED HIS QUARTERS
2522-147156-0045 THE LANDLORD SEIZED THE FEW BOBBINS AND TAPES I HAD LEFT FOR SHOP RENT AND THE PERSON TO WHOM THE MEAN LITTLE ROOM
2522-147156-0046 THREATENED TO TURN US OUT UNLESS HIS RENT WAS PAID
2522-147156-0047 AND IT WAS WINTER COLD BLEAK WINTER
2522-147156-0048 ALMOST AMOUNTING TO INSANITY AND SHAKING JEM'S ARM IN ORDER TO FORCE AN ANSWER FROM HIM
2522-147156-0049 HER VOICE HAD LOST ITS WILDNESS AND SHE SPOKE WITH THE QUIET OF DESPAIR BUT IT'S NO MATTER I'VE DONE THAT SINCE WHICH SEPARATES US AS FAR ASUNDER AS HEAVEN AND HELL CAN BE
2522-147156-0050 HER VOICE ROSE AGAIN TO THE SHARP PITCH OF AGONY MY DARLING MY DARLING
2522-147156-0051 LIKE A LITTLE ANGEL WHAT IS THAT TEXT I DON'T REMEMBER THAT TEXT MOTHER USED TO TEACH ME WHEN I SAT ON HER KNEE LONG AGO IT BEGINS
2522-147156-0052 FOR THEY SHALL SEE GOD AY THAT'S IT
2522-147156-0053 IT DID BREAK MARY'S HEART YOU SEE
2522-147156-0054 YOU KNOW MARY BARTON DON'T YOU SAID SHE TRYING TO COLLECT HER THOUGHTS YES JEM KNEW HER HOW WELL HIS BEATING HEART COULD TESTIFY WELL
2522-147156-0055 HE DEEPLY PITIED HER BUT OH HOW HE LONGED TO RECALL HER MIND TO THE SUBJECT OF MARY AND THE LOVER ABOVE HER IN RANK AND THE SERVICE TO BE DONE FOR HER SAKE BUT HE CONTROLLED HIMSELF TO SILENCE
2522-147156-0056 AFTER AWHILE SHE SPOKE AGAIN AND IN A CALMER VOICE WHEN I CAME TO MANCHESTER
2522-147156-0057 I FOUND YOU ALL OUT VERY SOON
2522-147156-0058 I USED TO WATCH ABOUT THE COURT WHERE JOHN LIVED FOR MANY AND MANY A NIGHT AND GATHER ALL I COULD ABOUT THEM FROM THE NEIGHBOURS TALK
2522-147156-0059 MANY'S THE TIME I'VE WATCHED THE POLICEMAN OFF HIS BEAT AND PEEPED THROUGH THE CHINK OF THE WINDOW SHUTTER TO SEE THE OLD ROOM
2522-147156-0060 I FOUND OUT MARY WENT TO LEARN DRESS MAKING
2522-147156-0061 AND AFTER MANY AN HOUR OF WEARY WORK THEY'RE READY TO FOLLOW AFTER ANY NOVELTY THAT MAKES A LITTLE CHANGE BUT I MADE UP MY MIND THAT BAD AS I WAS I COULD WATCH OVER MARY AND PERHAPS KEEP HER FROM HARM
2522-147156-0062 OFTEN WHEN SHE LITTLE KNEW ANY ONE WAS NEAR HER THERE WAS ONE OF HER COMPANIONS I NEVER COULD ABIDE
2522-147156-0063 BY AND BYE MARY'S WALKS HOMEWARDS WERE NOT ALONE SHE WAS JOINED SOON AFTER SHE CAME OUT BY A MAN A GENTLEMAN I BEGAN TO FEAR FOR HER FOR I SAW SHE WAS LIGHT HEARTED AND PLEASED WITH HIS ATTENTIONS
2522-147156-0064 AND I THOUGHT WORSE OF HIM FOR HAVING SUCH LONG TALKS WITH THAT BOLD GIRL I TOLD YOU OF BUT I WAS LAID UP FOR A LONG TIME WITH SPITTING OF BLOOD AND COULD DO NOTHING I'M SURE IT MADE ME WORSE THINKING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING TO MARY
2522-147156-0065 AND WHEN I CAME OUT ALL WAS GOING ON AS BEFORE
2522-147156-0066 AND OH JEM HER FATHER WON'T LISTEN TO ME AND IT'S YOU MUST SAVE MARY YOU'RE LIKE A BROTHER TO HER AND MAYBE COULD GIVE HER ADVICE AND WATCH OVER HER AND AT ANY RATE JOHN WILL HEARKEN TO YOU ONLY HE'S SO STERN AND SO CRUEL
2522-147156-0067 BUT JEM CUT HER SHORT BY HIS HOARSE STERN INQUIRY WHO IS THIS SPARK THAT MARY LOVES TELL ME HIS NAME IT'S YOUNG CARSON OLD CARSON'S SON THAT YOUR FATHER WORKED FOR THERE WAS A PAUSE
2522-147156-0068 SHE BROKE THE SILENCE OH JEM I CHARGE YOU WITH THE CARE OF HER I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE MURDER TO KILL HER BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER TO DIE THAN TO LIVE TO LEAD SUCH A LIFE AS I DO
2522-147156-0069 BETTER WE WERE ALL DEAD THIS WAS SAID AS IF THINKING ALOUD BUT HE IMMEDIATELY CHANGED HIS TONE AND CONTINUED ESTHER YOU MAY TRUST TO MY DOING ALL I CAN FOR MARY THAT I HAVE DETERMINED ON
2522-147156-0070 AND NOW LISTEN TO ME YOU LOATHE THE LIFE YOU LEAD ELSE YOU WOULD NOT SPEAK OF IT AS YOU DO COME HOME WITH ME COME TO MY MOTHER SHE AND MY AUNT ALICE LIVE TOGETHER
2522-147156-0071 THEN SHE SAID GOD BLESS YOU JEM
2522-147156-0072 SOME YEARS AGO YOU MIGHT HAVE SAVED ME AS I HOPE AND TRUST YOU WILL YET SAVE MARY
2522-147156-0073 TOO LATE SHE ADDED WITH ACCENTS OF DEEP DESPAIR STILL HE DID NOT RELAX HIS HOLD COME HOME HE SAID I TELL YOU I CANNOT
2522-147156-0074 I COULD NOT LEAD A VIRTUOUS LIFE IF I WOULD I SHOULD ONLY DISGRACE YOU IF YOU WILL KNOW ALL SAID SHE AS HE STILL SEEMED INCLINED TO URGE HER I MUST HAVE DRINK SUCH AS LIVE LIKE ME COULD NOT BEAR LIFE IF THEY DID NOT DRINK
2522-147156-0075 IT'S THE ONLY THING TO KEEP US FROM SUICIDE IF WE DID NOT DRINK WE COULD NOT STAND THE MEMORY OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN AND THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WE ARE FOR A DAY IF I GO WITHOUT FOOD AND WITHOUT SHELTER I MUST HAVE MY DRAM
2522-147156-0076 AND GLARING ROUND WITH TERRIFIED EYES AS IF DREADING TO SEE SOME SPIRITUAL CREATURE WITH DIM FORM NEAR HER
2522-147156-0077 WHISPERING IN TONES OF WILDNESS ALTHOUGH SO LOW SPOKEN THERE THEY GO ROUND AND ROUND MY BED THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH MY MOTHER CARRYING LITTLE ANNIE I WONDER HOW THEY GOT TOGETHER
2522-147156-0078 AND MARY AND ALL LOOKING AT ME WITH THEIR SAD STONY EYES OH JEM IT IS SO TERRIBLE THEY DON'T TURN BACK EITHER BUT PASS BEHIND THE HEAD OF THE BED AND I FEEL THEIR EYES ON ME EVERYWHERE IF I CREEP UNDER THE CLOTHES I STILL SEE THEM
2522-147156-0079 HISSING OUT HER WORDS WITH FRIGHT
2522-147156-0080 OH COULD HE THEN DO NOTHING FOR HER SHE SPOKE AGAIN BUT IN A LESS EXCITED TONE ALTHOUGH IT WAS THRILLINGLY EARNEST YOU ARE GRIEVED FOR ME
2522-147156-0081 I AM PAST HOPE YOU CAN YET SAVE MARY YOU MUST SHE IS INNOCENT
2522-147156-0082 JEM YOU WILL SAVE HER WITH HEART AND SOUL THOUGH IN FEW WORDS JEM PROMISED THAT IF AUGHT EARTHLY COULD KEEP HER FROM FALLING HE WOULD DO IT THEN SHE BLESSED HIM AND BADE HIM GOOD NIGHT
2522-147156-0083 STAY A MINUTE SAID HE AS SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF DEPARTURE
2522-147156-0084 WHERE DO YOU LIVE SHE LAUGHED STRANGELY AND DO YOU THINK ONE SUNK SO LOW AS I AM HAS A HOME DECENT GOOD PEOPLE HAVE HOMES WE HAVE NONE NO IF YOU WANT ME
2522-147156-0085 COME AT NIGHT AND LOOK AT THE CORNERS OF THE STREETS ABOUT HERE THE COLDER THE BLEAKER THE MORE STORMY THE NIGHT THE MORE CERTAIN YOU WILL BE TO FIND ME FOR THEN SHE ADDED WITH A PLAINTIVE FALL IN HER VOICE
2522-147156-0086 AND I WANT A DRAM MORE THAN EVER AGAIN SHE RAPIDLY TURNED OFF AND JEM ALSO WENT ON HIS WAY BUT BEFORE HE REACHED THE END OF THE STREET EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE JEALOUS ANGUISH THAT FILLED HIS HEART HIS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM
2522-147156-0087 HE HAD NOT DONE ENOUGH TO SAVE HER ONE MORE EFFORT AND SHE MIGHT HAVE COME NAY TWENTY EFFORTS WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL REWARDED BY HER YIELDING HE TURNED BACK BUT SHE WAS GONE
2522-147156-0088 IN THE TUMULT OF HIS OTHER FEELINGS HIS SELF REPROACH WAS DEADENED FOR THE TIME BUT MANY AND MANY A DAY AFTERWARDS HE BITTERLY REGRETTED HIS OMISSION OF DUTY HIS WEARINESS OF WELL DOING
2522-147156-0089 NOW THE GREAT THING WAS TO REACH HOME AND SOLITUDE MARY LOVED ANOTHER OH HOW SHOULD HE BEAR IT HE HAD THOUGHT HER REJECTION OF HIM A HARD TRIAL BUT THAT WAS NOTHING NOW
2522-147156-0090 HE ONLY REMEMBERED IT TO BE THANKFUL HE HAD NOT YIELDED TO THE TEMPTATION OF TRYING HIS FATE AGAIN NOT IN ACTUAL WORDS BUT IN A MEETING WHERE HER MANNER SHOULD TELL FAR MORE THAN WORDS THAT HER SWEETER SMILES HER DAINTY MOVEMENTS
2522-147156-0091 HER PRETTY HOUSEHOLD WAYS WERE ALL TO BE RESERVED TO GLADDEN ANOTHER'S EYES AND HEART AND HE MUST LIVE ON THAT SEEMED THE STRANGEST THAT A LONG LIFE AND HE KNEW MEN DID LIVE LONG EVEN WITH DEEP BITING SORROW CORRODING AT THEIR HEARTS
2522-147156-0092 MUST BE SPENT WITHOUT MARY NAY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS SHE WAS ANOTHER'S THAT HELL OF THOUGHT HE WOULD RESERVE FOR THE QUIET OF HIS OWN ROOM THE DEAD STILLNESS OF NIGHT HE WAS ON THE THRESHOLD OF HOME NOW
2522-147156-0093 HE ENTERED THERE WERE THE USUAL FACES THE USUAL SIGHTS HE LOATHED THEM AND THEN HE CURSED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE LOATHED THEM
2522-147156-0094 ALICE HER DULLED SENSES DEADENING DAY BY DAY SAT MUTELY NEAR THE FIRE
2522-147156-0095 KNOWING THAT HIS VOICE REPEATED WHAT WAS PASSING TO HER DEAFENED EAR THAT HIS ARM REMOVED EACH LITTLE OBSTACLE TO HER TOTTERING STEPS AND WILL OUT OF THE VERY KINDNESS OF HIS HEART TALKED MORE AND MORE MERRILY THAN EVER
2522-147156-0096 HE SAW JEM WAS DOWNCAST AND FANCIED HIS RATTLING MIGHT CHEER HIM AT ANY RATE IT DROWNED HIS AUNT'S MUTTERED GRUMBLINGS AND IN SOME MEASURE CONCEALED THE BLANK OF THE EVENING AT LAST BED TIME CAME
2522-147156-0097 AND WILL WITHDREW TO HIS NEIGHBOURING LODGING AND JANE AND ALICE WILSON HAD RAKED THE FIRE AND FASTENED DOORS AND SHUTTERS AND PATTERED UP STAIRS WITH THEIR TOTTERING FOOT STEPS AND SHRILL VOICES JEM TOO WENT TO THE CLOSET TERMED HIS BED ROOM
2522-147156-0098 THERE WAS NO BOLT TO THE DOOR BUT BY ONE STRONG EFFORT OF HIS RIGHT ARM A HEAVY CHEST WAS MOVED AGAINST IT AND HE COULD SIT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF HIS BED AND THINK MARY LOVED ANOTHER
2522-147156-0099 THAT IDEA WOULD RISE UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND AND HAD TO BE COMBATED IN ALL ITS FORMS OF PAIN IT WAS PERHAPS NO GREAT WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD PREFER ONE SO MUCH ABOVE JEM IN THE EXTERNAL THINGS OF LIFE BUT THE GENTLEMAN
2522-147156-0100 WHY DID HE WITH HIS RANGE OF CHOICE AMONG THE LADIES OF THE LAND WHY DID HE STOOP DOWN TO CARRY OFF THE POOR MAN'S DARLING WITH ALL THE GLORIES OF THE GARDEN AT HIS HAND WHY DID HE PREFER TO CULL THE WILD ROSE
2522-147156-0101 JEM'S OWN FRAGRANT WILD ROSE HIS OWN OH NEVER NOW HIS OWN GONE FOR EVERMORE THEN UPROSE THE GUILTY LONGING FOR BLOOD THE FRENZY OF JEALOUSY
2522-147156-0102 SOME ONE SHOULD DIE HE WOULD RATHER MARY WERE DEAD COLD IN HER GRAVE THAN THAT SHE WERE ANOTHER'S A VISION OF HER PALE SWEET FACE WITH HER BRIGHT HAIR ALL BEDABBLED WITH GORE SEEMED TO FLOAT CONSTANTLY BEFORE HIS ACHING EYES
2522-147156-0103 BUT HERS WERE EVER OPEN AND CONTAINED IN THEIR SOFT DEATHLY LOOK SUCH MUTE REPROACH WHAT HAD SHE DONE TO DESERVE SUCH CRUEL TREATMENT FROM HIM SHE HAD BEEN WOOED BY ONE WHOM JEM KNEW TO BE HANDSOME GAY AND BRIGHT
2522-147156-0104 THAT WAS ALL IT WAS THE WOOER WHO SHOULD DIE YES DIE KNOWING THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH JEM PICTURED HIM AND GLOATED ON THE PICTURE LYING SMITTEN YET CONSCIOUS
2522-147156-0105 AND LISTENING TO THE UPBRAIDING ACCUSATION OF HIS MURDERER HOW HE HAD LEFT HIS OWN RANK AND DARED TO LOVE A MAIDEN OF LOW DEGREE AND OH STINGING AGONY OF ALL HOW SHE IN RETURN HAD LOVED HIM
2522-147156-0106 THEN THE OTHER NATURE SPOKE UP AND BADE HIM REMEMBER THE ANGUISH HE SHOULD SO PREPARE FOR MARY AT FIRST HE REFUSED TO LISTEN TO THAT BETTER VOICE OR LISTENED ONLY TO PERVERT HE WOULD GLORY IN HER WAILING GRIEF
2522-147156-0107 HE WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN HER DESOLATION OF HEART NO HE COULD NOT SAID THE STILL SMALL VOICE IT WOULD BE WORSE
2522-147156-0108 THAN IT WAS NOW TO BEAR HIS PRESENT HEAVY BURDEN BUT IT WAS TOO HEAVY TOO GRIEVOUS TO BE BORNE AND LIVE HE WOULD SLAY HIMSELF AND THE LOVERS SHOULD LOVE ON
2522-147156-0109 AND THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT AND HE WITH HIS BURNING WOEFUL HEART WOULD BE AT REST
2522-147156-0110 HAD HE NOT PROMISED WITH SUCH EARNEST PURPOSE OF SOUL AS MAKES WORDS MORE SOLEMN THAN OATHS TO SAVE MARY FROM BECOMING SUCH AS ESTHER SHOULD HE SHRINK FROM THE DUTIES OF LIFE INTO THE COWARDLINESS OF DEATH
2522-147156-0111 WHO WOULD THEN GUARD MARY WITH HER LOVE AND HER INNOCENCE WOULD IT NOT BE A GOODLY THING TO SERVE HER ALTHOUGH SHE LOVED HIM NOT TO BE HER PRESERVING ANGEL THROUGH THE PERILS OF LIFE AND SHE UNCONSCIOUS ALL THE WHILE
2522-147156-0112 HE BRACED UP HIS SOUL AND SAID TO HIMSELF THAT WITH GOD'S HELP HE WOULD BE THAT EARTHLY KEEPER AND NOW THE MISTS AND THE STORMS SEEMED CLEARING AWAY FROM HIS PATH THOUGH IT STILL WAS FULL OF STINGING THORNS
2522-147156-0113 HAVING DONE THE DUTY NEAREST TO HIM OF REDUCING THE TUMULT OF HIS OWN HEART TO SOMETHING LIKE ORDER THE SECOND BECAME MORE PLAIN BEFORE HIM POOR ESTHER'S EXPERIENCE HAD LED HER PERHAPS TOO HASTILY
2522-147156-0114 TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MISTER CARSON'S INTENTIONS WERE EVIL TOWARDS MARY
2522-147156-0115 IT WAS POSSIBLE NAY TO JEM'S HEART VERY PROBABLE THAT HE MIGHT ONLY BE TOO HAPPY TO MARRY HER SHE WAS A LADY BY RIGHT OF NATURE JEM THOUGHT IN MOVEMENT GRACE AND SPIRIT
2522-147156-0116 WHAT WAS BIRTH TO A MANCHESTER MANUFACTURER MANY OF WHOM GLORY AND JUSTLY TOO IN BEING THE ARCHITECTS OF THEIR OWN FORTUNES AND AS FAR AS WEALTH WAS CONCERNED JUDGING ANOTHER BY HIMSELF
2522-147156-0117 JEM COULD ONLY IMAGINE IT A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO LAY IT AT THE FEET OF THE LOVED ONE HARRY CARSON'S MOTHER HAD BEEN A FACTORY GIRL SO AFTER ALL WHAT WAS THE GREAT REASON FOR DOUBTING HIS INTENTIONS TOWARDS MARY
2522-147156-0118 THERE MIGHT PROBABLY BE SOME LITTLE AWKWARDNESS ABOUT THE AFFAIR AT FIRST MARY'S FATHER HAVING SUCH STRONG PREJUDICES ON THE ONE HAND AND SOMETHING OF THE SAME KIND BEING LIKELY TO EXIST ON THE PART OF MISTER CARSON'S FAMILY
2522-147156-0119 BUT JEM KNEW HE HAD POWER OVER JOHN BARTON'S MIND AND IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO EXERT THAT POWER IN PROMOTING MARY'S HAPPINESS AND TO RELINQUISH ALL THOUGHT OF SELF IN SO DOING
2522-147156-0120 OH WHY HAD ESTHER CHOSEN HIM FOR THIS OFFICE IT WAS BEYOND HIS STRENGTH TO ACT RIGHTLY WHY HAD SHE SINGLED HIM OUT THE ANSWER CAME WHEN HE WAS CALM ENOUGH TO LISTEN FOR IT
2522-147156-0121 BECAUSE MARY HAD NO OTHER FRIEND CAPABLE OF THE DUTY REQUIRED OF HIM THE DUTY OF A BROTHER AS ESTHER IMAGINED HIM TO BE IN FEELING FROM HIS LONG FRIENDSHIP HE WOULD BE UNTO HER AS A BROTHER
2522-147156-0122 AS SUCH HE OUGHT TO ASCERTAIN HARRY CARSON'S INTENTIONS TOWARDS HER IN WINNING HER AFFECTIONS HE WOULD ASK HIM STRAIGHTFORWARDLY AS BECAME MAN SPEAKING TO MAN NOT CONCEALING IF NEED WERE
2522-147156-0123 THE INTEREST HE FELT IN MARY THEN WITH THE RESOLVE TO DO HIS DUTY TO THE BEST OF HIS POWER PEACE CAME INTO HIS SOUL HE HAD LEFT THE WINDY STORM AND TEMPEST BEHIND TWO HOURS BEFORE DAY DAWN
