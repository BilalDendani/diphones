4193-48169-0000 THE DISCOVERY IN PAUL STREET A FEW MONTHS AFTER VILLIERS MEETING WITH HERBERT MISTER CLARKE WAS SITTING AS USUAL BY HIS AFTER DINNER HEARTH RESOLUTELY GUARDING HIS FANCIES FROM WANDERING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BUREAU
4193-48169-0001 FOR MORE THAN A WEEK HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING AWAY FROM THE MEMOIRS AND HE CHERISHED HOPES OF A COMPLETE SELF REFORMATION BUT IN SPITE OF HIS ENDEAVOURS
4193-48169-0002 HE HAD PUT THE CASE OR RATHER THE OUTLINE OF IT CONJECTURALLY TO A SCIENTIFIC FRIEND WHO SHOOK HIS HEAD AND THOUGHT CLARKE GETTING QUEER AND ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING CLARKE WAS MAKING AN EFFORT TO RATIONALIZE THE STORY
4193-48169-0003 I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU FOR MANY MONTHS I SHOULD THINK NEARLY A YEAR COME IN COME IN AND HOW ARE YOU VILLIERS WANT ANY ADVICE ABOUT INVESTMENTS NO THANKS I FANCY EVERYTHING I HAVE IN THAT WAY IS PRETTY SAFE NO CLARKE
4193-48169-0004 I AM AFRAID YOU WILL THINK IT ALL RATHER ABSURD WHEN I TELL MY TALE I SOMETIMES THINK SO MYSELF AND THAT'S JUST WHAT I MADE UP MY MIND TO COME TO YOU AS I KNOW YOU'RE A PRACTICAL MAN MISTER VILLIERS WAS IGNORANT OF THE MEMOIRS TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
4193-48169-0005 BUT THIS I THINK BEATS ALL I WAS COMING OUT OF A RESTAURANT ONE NASTY WINTER NIGHT ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO I HAD HAD A CAPITAL DINNER AND A GOOD BOTTLE OF CHIANTI AND I STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE PAVEMENT THINKING WHAT A MYSTERY THERE IS ABOUT LONDON STREETS AND THE COMPANIES THAT PASS ALONG THEM
4193-48169-0006 A BOTTLE OF RED WINE ENCOURAGES THESE FANCIES CLARKE AND I DARE SAY I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT A PAGE OF SMALL TYPE
4193-48169-0007 WE WALKED UP AND DOWN ONE OF THOSE LONG AND DARK SOHO STREETS AND THERE I LISTENED TO HIS STORY HE SAID HE HAD MARRIED A BEAUTIFUL GIRL SOME YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF AND AS HE PUT IT SHE HAD CORRUPTED HIM BODY AND SOUL HE WOULDN'T GO INTO DETAILS
4193-48169-0008 HE SAID HE DARE NOT THAT WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD HAUNTED HIM BY NIGHT AND DAY
4193-48169-0009 THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE MAN THAT MADE ME SHIVER I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT IT WAS THERE I GAVE HIM A LITTLE MONEY AND SENT HIM AWAY AND I ASSURE YOU THAT WHEN HE WAS GONE I GASPED FOR BREATH HIS PRESENCE SEEMED TO CHILL ONE'S BLOOD
4193-48169-0010 I SUPPOSE THE POOR FELLOW HAD MADE AN IMPRUDENT MARRIAGE AND IN PLAIN ENGLISH GONE TO THE BAD WELL LISTEN TO THIS VILLIERS TOLD CLARKE THE STORY HE HAD HEARD FROM AUSTIN YOU SEE HE CONCLUDED
4193-48169-0011 THERE CAN BE BUT LITTLE DOUBT THAT THIS MISTER BLANK WHOEVER HE WAS DIED OF SHEER TERROR HE SAW SOMETHING SO AWFUL SO TERRIBLE THAT IT CUT SHORT HIS LIFE AND WHAT HE SAW HE MOST CERTAINLY SAW IN THAT HOUSE WHICH
4193-48169-0012 HAD GOT A BAD NAME IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD I HAD THE CURIOSITY TO GO AND LOOK AT THE PLACE FOR MYSELF IT'S A SADDENING KIND OF STREET THE HOUSES ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE MEAN AND DREARY BUT NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE QUAINT
4193-48169-0013 AS FAR AS I COULD SEE MOST OF THEM ARE LET IN LODGINGS FURNISHED AND UNFURNISHED AND ALMOST EVERY DOOR HAS THREE BELLS TO IT HERE AND THERE THE GROUND FLOORS HAVE BEEN MADE INTO SHOPS OF THE COMMONEST KIND IT'S A DISMAL STREET IN EVERY WAY I FOUND NUMBER TWENTY WAS TO LET
4193-48169-0014 AND I WENT TO THE AGENT'S AND GOT THE KEY OF COURSE I SHOULD HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF THE HERBERTS IN THAT QUARTER BUT I ASKED THE MAN FAIR AND SQUARE
4193-48169-0015 AND TOLD ME THE HERBERTS HAD LEFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE UNPLEASANTNESS AS HE CALLED IT
4193-48169-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RATHER FOND OF GOING OVER EMPTY HOUSES THERE'S A SORT OF FASCINATION ABOUT THE DESOLATE EMPTY ROOMS WITH THE NAILS STICKING IN THE WALLS AND THE DUST THICK UPON THE WINDOW SILLS BUT I DIDN'T ENJOY GOING OVER NUMBER TWENTY PAUL STREET
4193-48169-0017 HEAVY FEELING ABOUT THE AIR OF THE HOUSE OF COURSE ALL EMPTY HOUSES ARE STUFFY AND SO FORTH BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT TO YOU BUT IT SEEMED TO STOP THE BREATH I WENT INTO THE FRONT ROOM AND THE BACK ROOM
4193-48169-0018 AND THE KITCHENS DOWNSTAIRS THEY WERE ALL DIRTY AND DUSTY ENOUGH AS YOU WOULD EXPECT BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THEM ALL I COULDN'T DEFINE IT TO YOU I ONLY KNOW I FELT QUEER IT WAS ONE OF THE ROOMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR THOUGH THAT WAS THE WORST
4193-48169-0019 IT WAS A LARGISH ROOM AND ONCE ON A TIME THE PAPER MUST HAVE BEEN CHEERFUL ENOUGH BUT WHEN I SAW IT PAINT PAPER AND EVERYTHING WERE MOST DOLEFUL BUT THE ROOM WAS FULL OF HORROR I FELT MY TEETH GRINDING AS I PUT MY HAND ON THE DOOR AND WHEN I WENT IN
4193-48169-0020 HOWEVER I PULLED MYSELF TOGETHER AND STOOD AGAINST THE END WALL WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH THERE COULD BE ABOUT THE ROOM TO MAKE MY LIMBS TREMBLE
4193-48169-0021 IN ONE CORNER THERE WAS A PILE OF NEWSPAPERS LITTERED ON THE FLOOR AND I BEGAN LOOKING AT THEM THEY WERE PAPERS OF THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO SOME OF THEM HALF TORN
4193-48169-0022 PEOPLE STARED AT ME AS I WALKED ALONG THE STREET AND ONE MAN SAID I WAS DRUNK I WAS STAGGERING ABOUT FROM ONE SIDE OF THE PAVEMENT TO THE OTHER AND IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO TAKE THE KEY BACK TO THE AGENT AND GET HOME
4193-48169-0023 SUFFERING FROM WHAT MY DOCTOR CALLED NERVOUS SHOCK AND EXHAUSTION ONE OF THOSE DAYS I WAS READING THE EVENING PAPER AND HAPPENED TO NOTICE A PARAGRAPH HEADED STARVED TO DEATH
4193-48169-0024 A MODEL LODGING HOUSE IN MARYLEBONE A DOOR LOCKED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND A DEAD MAN IN HIS CHAIR WHEN THEY BROKE IN THE DECEASED SAID THE PARAGRAPH WAS KNOWN AS CHARLES HERBERT
4193-48169-0025 HIS NAME WAS FAMILIAR TO THE PUBLIC THREE YEARS AGO IN CONNECTION WITH THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH IN PAUL STREET TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD THE DECEASED BEING THE TENANT OF THE HOUSE NUMBER TWENTY
4193-48169-0026 WHICH I AM SURE IT WAS THE MAN'S LIFE WAS ALL A TRAGEDY AND A TRAGEDY OF A STRANGER SORT THAN THEY PUT ON THE BOARDS AND THAT IS THE STORY IS IT SAID CLARKE MUSINGLY YES THAT IS THE STORY
4193-48169-0027 SCARCELY KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT THERE ARE NO DOUBT CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE CASE WHICH SEEM PECULIAR THE FINDING OF THE DEAD MAN IN THE AREA OF HERBERT'S HOUSE FOR INSTANCE
4193-48169-0028 BUT AFTER ALL IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE FACTS MAY BE EXPLAINED IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER AS TO YOUR OWN SENSATIONS WHEN YOU WENT TO SEE THE HOUSE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY WERE DUE TO A VIVID IMAGINATION
4193-48169-0029 I DON'T EXACTLY SEE WHAT MORE CAN BE SAID OR DONE IN THE MATTER YOU EVIDENTLY THINK THERE IS A MYSTERY OF SOME KIND BUT HERBERT IS DEAD WHERE THEN DO YOU PROPOSE TO LOOK I PROPOSE TO LOOK FOR THE WOMAN THE WOMAN WHOM HE MARRIED SHE IS THE MYSTERY
4193-48169-0030 THE TWO MEN SAT SILENT BY THE FIRESIDE
4193-48169-0031 AND VILLIERS WRAPPED IN HIS GLOOMY FANCIES I THINK I WILL HAVE A CIGARETTE HE SAID AT LAST AND PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET TO FEEL FOR THE CIGARETTE CASE AH HE SAID STARTING SLIGHTLY I FORGOT I HAD SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU
4193-48169-0032 YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING THAT I HAD FOUND A RATHER CURIOUS SKETCH AMONGST THE PILE OF OLD NEWSPAPERS AT THE HOUSE IN PAUL STREET HERE IT IS
4193-48169-0033 IT WAS COVERED WITH BROWN PAPER AND SECURED WITH STRING AND THE KNOTS WERE TROUBLESOME IN SPITE OF HIMSELF CLARKE FELT INQUISITIVE
4193-48169-0034 AND UNFOLDED THE OUTER COVERING INSIDE WAS A SECOND WRAPPING OF TISSUE AND VILLIERS TOOK IT OFF AND HANDED THE SMALL PIECE OF PAPER TO CLARKE WITHOUT A WORD THERE WAS DEAD SILENCE IN THE ROOM FOR FIVE MINUTES OR MORE
4193-48169-0035 THE TWO MEN SAT SO STILL THAT THEY COULD HEAR THE TICKING OF THE TALL OLD FASHIONED CLOCK THAT STOOD OUTSIDE IN THE HALL AND IN THE MIND OF ONE OF THEM THE SLOW MONOTONY OF SOUND WOKE UP A FAR FAR MEMORY
4193-48169-0036 IT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN DRAWN WITH GREAT CARE AND BY A TRUE ARTIST FOR THE WOMAN'S SOUL LOOKED OUT OF THE EYES AND THE LIPS WERE PARTED WITH A STRANGE SMILE CLARKE GAZED STILL AT THE FACE IT BROUGHT TO HIS MEMORY ONE SUMMER EVENING LONG AGO
4193-48169-0037 HE SAW AGAIN THE LONG LOVELY VALLEY THE RIVER WINDING BETWEEN THE HILLS
4193-48169-0038 HE HEARD A VOICE SPEAKING TO HIM ACROSS THE WAVES OF MANY YEARS AND SAYING CLARKE MARY WILL SEE THE GOD PAN
4193-48169-0039 LISTENING TO THE HEAVY TICKING OF THE CLOCK WAITING AND WATCHING WATCHING THE FIGURE LYING ON THE GREEN CHAIR BENEATH THE LAMPLIGHT MARY ROSE UP AND HE LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND HIS HEART GREW COLD WITHIN HIM WHO IS THIS WOMAN
4193-48169-0040 HE SAID AT LAST HIS VOICE WAS DRY AND HOARSE THAT IS THE WOMAN WHO HERBERT MARRIED CLARKE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE SKETCH IT WAS NOT MARY AFTER ALL THERE CERTAINLY WAS MARY'S FACE BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE
4193-48169-0041 SOMETHING HE HAD NOT SEEN ON MARY'S FEATURES WHEN THE WHITE CLAD GIRL ENTERED THE LABORATORY WITH THE DOCTOR NOR AT HER TERRIBLE AWAKENING NOR WHEN SHE LAY GRINNING ON THE BED WHATEVER IT WAS THE GLANCE THAT CAME FROM THOSE EYES THE SMILE ON THE FULL LIPS
4193-48169-0042 OR THE EXPRESSION OF THE WHOLE FACE CLARKE SHUDDERED BEFORE IT AT HIS INMOST SOUL AND THOUGHT UNCONSCIOUSLY OF DOCTOR PHILLIP'S WORDS THE MOST VIVID PRESENTMENT OF EVIL I HAVE EVER SEEN HE TURNED THE PAPER OVER MECHANICALLY IN HIS HAND
4193-48169-0043 AND GLANCED AT THE BACK GOOD GOD CLARKE WHAT IS THE MATTER YOU ARE AS WHITE AS DEATH
4193-48169-0044 AS CLARKE FELL BACK WITH A GROAN AND LET THE PAPER DROP FROM HIS HANDS I DON'T FEEL VERY WELL VILLIERS I AM SUBJECT TO THESE ATTACKS POUR ME OUT A LITTLE WINE THANKS THAT WILL DO I SHALL FEEL BETTER IN A FEW MINUTES
4193-48169-0045 VILLIERS PICKED UP THE FALLEN SKETCH AND TURNED IT OVER AS CLARKE HAD DONE YOU SAW THAT HE SAID THAT'S HOW I IDENTIFIED IT AS BEING A PORTRAIT OF HERBERT'S WIFE OR I SHOULD SAY HIS WIDOW
4193-48169-0046 BETTER THANKS IT WAS ONLY A PASSING FAINTNESS I DON'T THINK I QUITE CATCH YOUR MEANING WHAT DID YOU SAY ENABLED YOU TO IDENTIFY THE PICTURE
4193-48169-0047 WAS WRITTEN ON THE BACK DIDN'T I TELL YOU HER NAME WAS HELEN YES HELEN VAUGHAN CLARKE GROANED THERE COULD BE NO SHADOW OF DOUBT NOW DON'T YOU AGREE WITH ME SAID VILLIERS THAT IN THE STORY I HAVE TOLD YOU TO NIGHT
4193-48169-0048 AND IN THE PART THIS WOMAN PLAYS IN IT THERE ARE SOME VERY STRANGE POINTS YES VILLIERS CLARKE MUTTERED IT IS A STRANGE STORY INDEED A STRANGE STORY INDEED YOU MUST GIVE ME TIME TO THINK IT OVER
