7120-76055-0010 DEATH APPROVED OF SIR RICHMOND'S DETERMINATION TO SEE THE COMMITTEE THROUGH OUR UNIVERSAL CREDITOR GAVE THIS PARTICULAR DEBTOR GRACE TO THE VERY LAST MEETING THEN HE BRUSHED A GUST OF CHILLY RAIN
7120-76055-0011 ACROSS THE FACE OF SIR RICHMOND AS HE STOOD WAITING FOR HIS CAR OUTSIDE THE STRANGERS ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS SIR RICHMOND FELT ALMOST INTOLERABLY TIRED
7120-76055-0012 BUT SCARCELY NOTED THE CHANGED TIMBRE OF THE WHEEZY NOTES IN HIS THROAT HE ROSE LATER EACH DAY AND WITH EBBING VIGOUR JOTTED DOWN NOTES AND CORRECTIONS UPON THE PROOFS OF THE MINORITY REPORT HE FOUND IT
7120-76055-0013 INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE DECISIONS HE WOULD CORRECT AND ALTER BACK AND THEN REPEAT THE CORRECTION PERHAPS HALF A DOZEN TIMES ON THE EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY HIS LUNGS BECAME PAINFUL AND HIS BREATHING
7120-76055-0014 DIFFICULT HIS HEAD ACHED AND A SENSE OF SOME GREAT IMPENDING EVIL CAME UPON HIM HIS SKIN WAS SUDDENLY A DETESTABLE GARMENT TO WEAR HE TOOK HIS TEMPERATURE WITH A LITTLE CLINICAL THERMOMETER HE KEPT BY HIM
7120-76055-0015 AND FOUND IT WAS A HUNDRED AND ONE HE TELEPHONED HASTILY FOR DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIS ARRIVAL TOOK A HOT BATH AND GOT INTO BED HE WAS ALREADY THOROUGHLY ILL WHEN THE DOCTOR ARRIVED
7120-76055-0016 FORGIVE MY SENDING FOR YOU HE SAID NOT YOUR LINE I KNOW MY WIFE'S G P AN EXASPERATING SORT OF ASS CAN'T STAND HIM NO ONE ELSE
7120-76055-0017 HE WAS LYING ON A NARROW LITTLE BED WITH A HARD PILLOW THAT THE DOCTOR REPLACED BY ONE FROM LADY HARDY'S ROOM HE HAD TWISTED THE BED CLOTHES INTO A HOPELESS MUDDLE THE SHEET WAS ON THE FLOOR
7120-76055-0018 SIR RICHMOND'S BEDROOM WAS A LARGE APARTMENT IN WHICH SLEEP SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN AN ADMITTED NECESSITY RATHER THAN A PRINCIPAL PURPOSE ON ONE HAND
7120-76055-0019 ALL THE APPARATUS FOR THE LONELY INTENT INDUSTRY OF THE SMALL HOURS THERE WAS A BOOKCASE OF BLUEBOOKS BOOKS OF REFERENCE AND SUCHLIKE MATERIAL AND SOME FILES
7120-76055-0020 UPON WHICH SIR RICHMOND HAD BEEN WORKING UP TO THE MOMENT OF HIS HASTY RETREAT TO BED AND LYING AMONG THE PROOFS AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT AND LOOKED AT QUITE RECENTLY WAS THE PHOTOGRAPH OF A GIRL
7120-76055-0021 IT WAS NOT HIS BUSINESS TO KNOW THESE VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS PRINTED THEMSELVES ON DOCTOR MARTINEAU'S MIND AFTER HIS FIRST CURSORY EXAMINATION OF HIS PATIENT AND WHILE HE CAST ABOUT FOR ANYTHING
7120-76055-0022 THAT WOULD GIVE THIS LARGE INDUSTRIOUS APARTMENT A LITTLE MORE OF THE RESTFULNESS AND COMFORT OF A SICK ROOM I MUST GET IN A NIGHT NURSE AT ONCE HE SAID WE MUST FIND A SMALL TABLE SOMEWHERE TO PUT NEAR THE BED
7120-76055-0023 I AM AFRAID YOU ARE VERY ILL HE SAID RETURNING TO THE BEDSIDE THIS IS NOT AS YOU SAY MY SORT OF WORK WILL YOU LET ME CALL IN ANOTHER MAN
7120-76055-0024 A MAN WE CAN TRUST THOROUGHLY TO CONSULT I'M IN YOUR HANDS SAID SIR RICHMOND I WANT TO PULL THROUGH HE WILL KNOW BETTER WHERE TO GET THE RIGHT SORT OF NURSE FOR THE CASE
7120-76055-0025 AND EVERYTHING THE SECOND DOCTOR PRESENTLY CAME WITH THE RIGHT SORT OF NURSE HARD ON HIS HEELS SIR RICHMOND SUBMITTED ALMOST SILENTLY TO HIS EXPERT HANDLING AND WAS SOUNDED AND LOOKED TO AND LISTENED AT
7120-76055-0026 BUT HE DID NOT FEEL VERY DEEPLY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY WERE SAYING HE BEGAN TO THINK WHAT A DECENT CHAP DOCTOR MARTINEAU WAS HOW HELPFUL AND FINE AND FORGIVING HIS PROFESSIONAL TRAINING HAD MADE HIM HOW COMPLETELY
7120-76055-0027 HE HAD IGNORED THE SMOTHERED INCIVILITIES OF THEIR PARTING AT SALISBURY ALL MEN OUGHT TO HAVE SOME SUCH TRAINING NOT A BAD IDEA TO PUT EVERY BOY AND GIRL THROUGH A YEAR OR SO OF HOSPITAL SERVICE
7120-76055-0028 THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT FIRST SIR RICHMOND'S RAISED EYEBROWS CONVEYED THAT HE ACCEPTED THIS FACT I THINK LADY HARDY OUGHT TO BE SENT FOR
7120-76055-0029 SEND THEN AN EXPRESSION OF OBSTINATE CALM OVERSPREAD SIR RICHMOND'S FACE HE SEEMED TO REGARD THE MATTER AS SETTLED HE CLOSED HIS EYES
7120-76055-0030 MAY TAKE VERY RAPID AND UNEXPECTED TURNS SIR RICHMOND CHEEK ON PILLOW SEEMED TO ASSENT I THINK IF YOU WANT TO BE SURE THAT LADY HARDY SEES YOU AGAIN
7120-76055-0031 IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE RISKS ABOUT THAT ONE NEVER KNOWS IN THESE CASES PROBABLY THERE IS A NIGHT TRAIN SIR RICHMOND MANIFESTED NO SURPRISE AT THE WARNING
7120-76055-0032 BUT HE STUCK TO HIS POINT HIS VOICE WAS FAINT BUT FIRM COULDN'T MAKE UP ANYTHING TO SAY TO HER ANYTHING SHE'D LIKE DOCTOR MARTINEAU
7120-76055-0033 RESTED ON THAT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEN HE SAID IF THERE IS ANYONE ELSE NOT POSSIBLE SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH HIS EYES ON THE CEILING
7120-76055-0034 BUT TO SEE SIR RICHMOND TURNED HIS HEAD TO DOCTOR MARTINEAU HIS FACE PUCKERED LIKE A PEEVISH CHILD'S THEY'D WANT THINGS SAID TO THEM THINGS TO REMEMBER I
7120-76055-0035 CAN'T I'M TIRED OUT DON'T TROUBLE WHISPERED DOCTOR MARTINEAU SUDDENLY REMORSEFUL BUT SIR RICHMOND WAS ALSO REMORSEFUL GIVE THEM MY LOVE

7120-76055-0044 HIS VOICE SANK TO THE FAINTEST WHISPER DONE FOR EVER AND EVER AND EVER AND EVER AGAIN HE SEEMED TO DOZE
7120-76055-0045 DOCTOR MARTINEAU STOOD UP SOFTLY SOMETHING BEYOND REASON TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS CERTAINLY A DYING MAN HE WAS RELUCTANT TO GO AND HE HAD AN ABSURD DESIRE THAT SOMEONE
7120-76055-0046 SOMEONE FOR WHOM SIR RICHMOND CARED SHOULD COME AND SAY GOOD BYE TO HIM AND FOR SIR RICHMOND TO SAY GOOD BYE TO SOMEONE
7120-76055-0047 HE HATED THIS LONELY LAUNCHING FROM THE SHORES OF LIFE OF ONE WHO HAD SOUGHT INTIMACY SO PERSISTENTLY AND VAINLY IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY HE SAW IT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME
7120-76055-0048 LITTERED LIKE A RECENT BATTLEFIELD THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE AMERICAN GIRL DREW HIS EYES WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS THERE NOT PERHAPS SOME WORD FOR HER
7120-76055-0049 HE TURNED ABOUT AS IF TO ENQUIRE OF THE DYING MAN AND FOUND SIR RICHMOND'S EYES OPEN AND REGARDING HIM IN THEM HE SAW AN EXPRESSION HE HAD SEEN THERE ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE
7120-76055-0050 A FAINT BUT EXCESSIVELY IRRITATING GLEAM OF AMUSEMENT OH
7120-76055-0051 AND TURNED AWAY HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND STARED OUT AS HIS HABIT WAS SIR RICHMOND CONTINUED TO SMILE DIMLY AT THE DOCTOR'S BACK UNTIL HIS EYES CLOSED AGAIN
7120-76055-0052 IT WAS THEIR LAST EXCHANGE SIR RICHMOND DIED THAT NIGHT IN THE SMALL HOURS SO QUIETLY THAT FOR SOME TIME THE NIGHT NURSE DID NOT OBSERVE WHAT HAD HAPPENED
