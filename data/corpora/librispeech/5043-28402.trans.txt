5043-28402-0000 JEALOUSY IS A PASSION WHICH ALLOWS THE HAPLESS POSSESSOR TO ENJOY NEITHER REST NOR CONFIDENCE IT IS FREQUENTLY THE COMPANION OF LOVE SHAKSPEARE SAYS
5043-28402-0001 FOR WHERE LOVE REIGNS DISTURBING JEALOUSY DOTH CALL HIMSELF AFFECTION'S SENTINEL WHEN THIS PRINCIPLE OBTAINS POSSESSION OF THE BREAST IT DESTROYS THE HEALTH AND SPIRITS THE STREAMS WHICH GLADDEN THE HEART BECOME CORRUPTED
5043-28402-0002 AND PRODUCTIVE OF RAGE AND MELANCHOLY JEALOUSY IS LIKE THE SNAKE WHICH INSIDIOUSLY ENTWINES ITSELF AROUND ITS VICTIM OR LIKE THE BOHUN UPAS OF JAVA WHICH DIFFUSES DEATH
5043-28402-0003 THE BRIGHT BEAMS OF HOPE WHICH CHEERED THE POSSESSOR
5043-28402-0004 MOLIERE THE POET WAS ENDOWED WITH AN EMINENT GENIUS HE WAS ESTEEMED AS THE FIRST WIT IN EUROPE BUT HIS WIFE WAS FAITHLESS AND NO ENJOYMENT OR SUCCESS OR HONOR COULD TRANQUILLIZE HIS MIND AND MAKE HIM HAPPY
5043-28402-0005 THE ATTRACTIONS OF YOUTH AND BEAUTY WILL SOMETIMES EXCITE AN ILLICIT PASSION BUT THE INDULGENCE OF THIS FEELING IS THE PATH TO ANXIETY AND DEGRADATION THE FEMALE MAY BE LESS FAULTY
5043-28402-0006 BUT SHE WILL BE THE GREATER SUFFERER FOR WITH REGARD TO HER LAWFUL COMPANION CONFIDENCE IS CHANGED TO TIMIDITY LOVE TO HYPOCRISY AND A CONTINUAL FEAR TORMENTS HER LEST ACCIDENT OR MALICE SHOULD DISCOVER HER IMPRUDENCE
5043-28402-0007 AND THUS MAKE OTHERS UNHAPPY WHERE VIRTUE ONLY EXISTS IT IS A MOST GRIEVOUS HARDSHIP
5043-28402-0008 NOTHING SHOULD BE MADE WITH MORE CAUTION THAN A DECISION IN WHICH THE INNOCENT MAY RECEIVE THE ODIUM WHICH BELONGS TO THE GUILTY SOMETIMES THE WORST SORT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE BROUGHT BY A LADY INTO THE MARRIAGE STATE
5043-28402-0009 SHE MAY BE CAPABLE OF SINGING ADMIRABLY OF DANCING OF PAINTING OF PERFORMING SKILFULLY ON THE HARP OR PIANO OF MAKING INGENIOUS TRINKETS AND ORNAMENTS
5043-28402-0010 ALL THIS MAY BE WELL ENOUGH FOR AN UNMARRIED LADY BUT OF WHAT USE ARE THEY IN A STATE OF MATRIMONY IT IS TRUE THAT IF SHE BE FAVORED WITH A HANDSOME FORTUNE SHE MAY INDULGE HERSELF AGREEABLY WITH HER INCLINATION
5043-28402-0011 AND EMPLOY OTHERS TO MANAGE HER HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS BUT NOT MANY ARE THUS SITUATED AND EVEN IN THIS CASE THERE ARE DUTIES WHICH BELONG TO THE WIFE
5043-28402-0012 IT IS STILL WORSE IF SHE BE FOND OF DISSIPATION OF ROUTS BALLS AND PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS IF SHE FLY ABROAD IN PURSUIT OF A PHANTOM WHILE DOMESTIC ENJOYMENT IS NEGLECTED A GOOD WIFE WILL ENDEAVOR TO MAKE HERSELF HAPPY AT HOME
5043-28402-0013 AND THAT THE CHILDREN MAY BE REGULATED WITH ALL NECESSARY CARE A GOOD TEMPER IS ESSENTIAL FOR MATRIMONIAL HAPPINESS AN HABITUALLY IRRITABLE OR GLOOMY DISPOSITION IS A SOURCE OF MISERY TO THE POSSESSOR AND TO OTHERS
5043-28402-0014 CANNOT BE EASILY BROKEN IF ONE BE PERVERSE THE OTHER MUST BEND IF TWO TREES BE BOUND TIGHTLY TOGETHER AND BOTH BE STIFF THE CORDS WILL PROBABLY BREAK IF NOT IMMEDIATELY THEY WILL WHEN THE CORDS BECOME WEAKER
5043-28402-0015 AND THUS WITH REGARD TO MATRIMONY WHAT GOD HAS JOINED TOGETHER THE PERVERSITY OF HUMAN BEINGS WILL PUT ASUNDER OBSTINACY IN TRIFLING MATTERS IN THE MARRIAGE STATE IS AN EVIDENCE OF LITTLE LOVE AND A BAD HEART
5043-28402-0016 BUT IF TRIFLING MATTERS APPEAR IMPORTANT AND THE GAINING OF EVERY POINT BE AS THE TAKING OF A CITADEL THE PERSON IS WRONG IN HIS JUDGMENT HE IS INSANE OR PARTIALLY SO
5043-28402-0017 MANY WORTHY WOMEN HAVE BEEN CURSED WITH WORTHLESS HUSBANDS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE GRIEVANCES OF THE FEMALE SEX HAVE BEEN LESS FREQUENTLY KNOWN THAN THOSE OF THE MEN FOR WOMEN ARE NOT AUTHORS AND MEN ARE FREQUENTLY SO
5043-28402-0018 CONSEQUENTLY IN ALL ESTIMATES OF THE COMPARATIVE MERIT OF THE SEXES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT MORE HAS BEEN SAID ON THE ONE SIDE THAN ON THE OTHER HOME HOWEVER IS THE CASTLE OF THE WIFE IF SHE BE A GOOD ONE HERE SHE KEEPS
5043-28402-0019 HER PERMANENT ABODE AGREEABLY WITH THE INJUNCTION OF SAINT PAUL THE HUSBAND IS ABSENT THE PRINCIPAL PART OF HIS TIME MAY THERE NOT THEREFORE ON SOME OCCASIONS BE TOO GREET AN INCLINATION IN THE LADY TO CONSIDER HERSELF AS THE GOVERNOR OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
5043-28402-0020 WHILE THE HUSBAND MAY BE DEEMED A VISITER RATHER THAN THE MASTER THIS WOULD NOT ARISE IN THE BREAST OF AN AMIABLE AND AFFECTIONATE WIFE BUT IT HAS SOMETIMES ARISEN FOR UNFORTUNATELY ALL WIVES HAVE NOT BEEN GOOD ONES
5043-28402-0021 JEROME CARDAN WAS SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO HAVE A WIFE WHO WAS PROVERBIAL FOR HER ILL TEMPER AND ARBITRARY CONDUCT JOHN KNOX SAID OF LORD ERSKINE
5043-28402-0022 SALMASIUS THE OPPONENT OF MILTON WAS MADE PERPETUALLY UNEASY BY A SIMILAR THORN THE UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND WAS A FRENCHMAN AND MILTON SAID AS DOCTOR JOHNSON OBSERVES TU ES GALLUS ET UT AIUNT
5043-28402-0023 NIMIUM GALLINACEUS MILTON HIMSELF SEEMS TO HAVE SUFFERED FROM A SIMILAR CAUSE FOR HE EVINCES SO MUCH HOSTILITY TO THE FEMALE SEX THAT NO OTHER REASON WOULD SO NATURALLY ACCOUNT FOR IT HE EXCLAIMS O
5043-28402-0024 WHY DID GOD CREATOR WISE THAT PEOPLED HIGHEST HEAVEN WITH SPIRITS MASCULINE CREATE AT LAST THIS NOVELTY ON EARTH THIS FAIR DEFECT OF NATURE
5043-28402-0025 AND NOT FILL THE WORLD AT ONCE WITH MEN AND ANGELS WITHOUT FEMININE MILTON ADDS A GREAT DEAL MORE WHICH IF HE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF WOMAN
5043-28402-0026 EVEN HIS ANXIETY TO MAKE HIS CHARACTER OF ADAM CONSISTENT WOULD NOT HAVE DEMANDED AN AMIABLE TEMPER ON THE PART OF A WIFE WITH HER OWN NATURAL SOFTNESS AND AN INCLINATION TO YIELD IN UNIMPORTANT MATTERS WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE LOVE BUT POWER
5043-28402-0027 FOR IN THIS RESPECT AGREEABLY TO THE OPINION OF PRINCE EUGENE LOVE IS POWER MARRIAGE IS SOMETIMES MADE A MATTER OF MERE CONVENIENCE
5043-28402-0028 PEOPLE ENTER INTO IT WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THEY WOULD INTO ANY OTHER SPECULATION AND WHEN ONE COMPANION DIES THEY TAKE ANOTHER IN THE BOOK OF TOBIT WE HAVE AN ACCOUNT
5043-28402-0029 WHO HAD BEEN FAVORED WITH SEVEN HUSBANDS WHOM ASMODEUS THE EVIL SPIRIT HAD KILLED LOVE MUST BE EXCEEDINGLY PLIABLE IT MUST BE LOVE TO MAN AND NOT TO A MAN
5043-28402-0030 BURST THEIR CEREMENTS AND VISIT THEIR FORMER DWELLING WHAT ASTONISHMENT WHAT UPLIFTED HANDS AND DISTENDED EYEBALLS WHAT SPEECHLESSNESS AND VIOLENT SPEECHES REPROACHES AND ANIMOSITIES
5043-28402-0031 MARRIAGE MAY BE WELL EXTENDED TO TWO WIVES AND TWO HUSBANDS IN SUCCESSION THIS IN SOME CASES IS NECESSARY
5043-28402-0032 THE MAN WHO MOVES FROM PLACE SOMETIMES LIVING HERE AND SOMETIMES THERE WILL NEVER GAIN A PURE AND ARDENT LOVE OF HOME BY THE SAME RULE A SUCCESSION OF WIVES WILL ONLY INDUCE AN HABITUAL OR MECHANICAL REGARD TO THE WIFE
5043-28402-0033 FOR THE TIME BEING IN THE SAME WAY AS LOYALTY MAY BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE SOVEREIGN TO ANOTHER BESIDES A FAMILY WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF RELATIONSHIP AND WITH DIFFERENT INTERESTS IS FORMED AND THIS CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TOWARDS DOMESTIC TRANQUILLITY
5043-28402-0034 THERE MAY BE SOME PARTICULAR CASES IN WHICH THE EVILS TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED MAY NOT ARISE THESE MAY BE DEEMED EXCEPTIONS THERE ARE SOME SORROWS PECULIAR TO MATRIMONY
5043-28402-0035 AND SOME WHICH THOUGH THEY FALL ON OTHER CONDITIONS OF LIFE ARE FELT MORE HEAVILY WHEN THEY INTRUDE THEMSELVES WITHIN THE BOUNDARY OF CONNUBIAL LOVE POVERTY AND SICKNESS ARE MORE GRIEVOUS EVILS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS SORT
5043-28402-0036 BECAUSE A MAN FEELS NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR OTHERS HOW DREADFUL MUST IT BE WHEN THE HUSBAND BEHOLDS HIS WIFE IN SQUALID MISERY WHAT ARE THE FEELINGS OF A MOTHER WHEN SHE SEES HER INNOCENT CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM HUNGER
5043-28402-0037 AND WHEN THE IRON HAND OF AFFLICTION PRESSES UPON THE BROW OF A HUSBAND OR A WIFE AND THE SHARP ARROWS OF PAIN OCCASION GROANS IS THERE NOT AN ALMOST EQUAL ANGUISH
5043-28402-0038 WHO HAD LIVED IN THE BONDS OF HARMONY WHEN THE CHILLY ARMS OF DEATH ARE HELD OUT TO CLASP HIM OR HER WHO HAD BEEN USED TO A MORE TENDER EMBRACE HOW DREADFUL IS THAT PERIOD
5043-28402-0039 IS NOT THE WOE OF SEPARATING GENERALLY IN THE SAME PROPORTION AS THE BLISS OF UNITING AND IS IT NOT A VALUABLE LOAN TO BE PAID BY A MIGHTY SACRIFICE
5043-28402-0040 UNHAPPINESS MAY BE OCCASIONED BY INDULGING AN UNDUE DEGREE OF LOVE SENTIMENTAL BLISS IS GENERALLY FOLLOWED BY SENTIMENTAL SORROW CONSEQUENTLY PEOPLE MAY LOVE ONE ANOTHER TOO ARDENTLY
5043-28402-0041 SO AS TO MAKE THE THOUGHT OF PARTING A SOURCE OF MISERY IF TWO PLANTS GROW UP TOGETHER IMPARTING TO EACH OTHER SHELTER AND FRAGRANCE IT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE
5043-28402-0042 BUT IF THEY BECOME SO CLOSELY UNITED AS TO GROW FROM THE SAME STALK AND DEPEND ON THE SAME NUTRIMENT THEN TAKE AWAY ONE AND BOTH WILL PERISH CONNUBIAL LOVE SHOULD THEREFORE BE REGULATED BY REASON
5043-28402-0043 IT IS NOT AN UNCOMMON EVENT FOR EXTERNAL ENEMIES TO OCCASION HARMONY AT HOME AND HARMONY AT HOME OR THE YIELDING TO THE FOOLISH NOTIONS OF EACH OTHER MAY OCCASION ENEMIES WITHOUT SO DIFFICULT IS IT TO ACT CONSISTENTLY
5043-28402-0044 PROPERTY ENOUGH TO SUPPLY THE WANTS OF A FAMILY GOOD HEALTH CHILDREN NOT TOO MANY NOR TOO FEW NOR ALL OF ONE SEX A CONTINUANCE IN EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
5043-28402-0045 TILL BOTH PASS AWAY GRADUALLY AS THE TWILIGHT INTO DARKNESS BUT IF CHILLY POVERTY EXERT ITS INFLUENCE IF THE HUSBAND OR THE WIFE BE ILL TEMPERED IF HE OR SHE BE UNFAITHFUL OR JEALOUS IF LOVE BE FOLLOWED BY HATRED
5043-28402-0046 IF ONE BE TAKEN AND THE OTHER LEFT IN SOLITUDE IF CHILDREN BE IMPERFECT IN BIRTH OR HABITUALLY SICKLY OR DROP OFF IN EARLY YEARS AS UNRIPE FRUIT
5043-28402-0047 IF SONS PROVE VICIOUS AND DAUGHTERS BRING DISGRACE ON THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES IF THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF CHILDREN BRING THEIR AGED PARENTS IN SORROW TO THE GRAVE WHERE THEN WILL BE THE PLEASURE OF MATRIMONY
5043-28402-0048 ARE MORE PERPLEXING THAN THE CARES OF A STATE CARDAN CONFESSED THAT OUT OF FOUR GREAT TROUBLES WHICH HE HAD EXPERIENCED TWO AROSE FROM HIS CHILDREN
5043-28402-0049 BECAUSE I WANT NO CHILDREN ONE OF THE ANCIENT SAGES WAS SO MUCH IMPRESSED WITH THE DISAPPOINTMENTS AND ANXIETIES OF MATRIMONY THAT WHEN HE WAS ASKED AT WHAT TIME A MAN SHOULD MARRY REPLIED IF HE BE YOUNG NOT YET
5043-28402-0050 IF OLDER NOT AT ALL THIS SENTIMENT HOWEVER SO REPUGNANT TO ALL OUR IDEAS OF SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT AS WELL AS TO THE COMMAND OF OUR CREATOR WHO PRESENTED WOMAN TO MAN AS A HELPMATE
5043-28402-0051 TOO DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE BREAST OF MAN AND THE REALITY OF DOMESTIC FELICITY HAS BEEN TOO LONG TESTED BY EXPERIENCE FOR EITHER TO BE SACRIFICED ON THE ALTAR OF THE REVILERS OF MATRIMONY WHETHER THEY BE LIBERTINES
5043-28402-0052 THERE IS A SYMPATHY OF HEART WHICH CONSECRATES THE SOCIAL SHRINE ROBS GRIEF OF GLOOM
