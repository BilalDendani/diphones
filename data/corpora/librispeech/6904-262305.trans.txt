6904-262305-0000 IT WERE SURELY A BREACH OF POLITENESS ON OUR PART NOT TO ATTEND MISTER KETCH IN HIS IMPROMPTU EVENING VISIT HE SHUFFLED ALONG AT THE VERY TOP OF HIS SPEED HIS MOUTH WATERING WHILE THE DELICIOUS ODOUR OF TRIPE AND ONIONS APPEARED TO BE BORNE ON THE AIR TO HIS OLFACTORY NERVES
6904-262305-0001 SO STRONG IS THE FORCE OF FANCY ARRIVED AT HIS DESTINATION HE FOUND THE SHOP CLOSED IT WAS MISSUS JENKINS'S CUSTOM TO CLOSE AT SEVEN FROM OCTOBER TO APRIL AND THE SHUTTERS HAD NOW JUST BEEN PUT UP MISTER KETCH SEIZED THE KNOCKER ON THE SHOP DOOR
6904-262305-0002 THERE WAS NO OTHER ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE AND BROUGHT IT DOWN WITH A FORCE THAT SHOOK THE FIRST FLOOR SITTING ROOM AND STARTLED MISTER HARPER THE LAY CLERK ALMOST OUT OF HIS ARMCHAIR AS HE SAT BEFORE THE FIRE MISSUS JENKINS'S MAID A YOUNG PERSON OF SEVENTEEN VERY MUCH GIVEN TO BLACKING HER FACE OPENED IT
6904-262305-0003 BE I IN TIME DEMANDED KETCH HIS VOICE SHAKING IN TIME FOR WHAT RESPONDED THE GIRL WHY FOR SUPPER SAID KETCH PENETRATING INTO THE SHOP WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY A CANDLE THAT STOOD ON THE COUNTER THE ONE THE GIRL HAD BROUGHT IN HER HAND
6904-262305-0004 KETCH WENT DOWN THE SHOP SNIFFING CURIOUSLY SHARP AS FANCY IS HE COULD NOT SAY THAT HE WAS REGALED WITH THE SCENT OF ONIONS BUT HE SUPPOSED THE SAUCEPAN LID MIGHT BE ON FOR AS WAS KNOWN TO MISTER KETCH AND TO OTHER OF THE INITIATED IN TRIPE MYSTERIES
6904-262305-0005 IT WAS GENERALLY THOUGHT ADVISABLE BY GOOD HOUSEWIVES TO GIVE THE TRIPE A BOIL UP AT HOME LEST IT SHOULD HAVE BECOME COLD IN ITS TRANSIT FROM THE VENDOR'S THE GIRL THREW OPEN THE DOOR OF THE SMALL PARLOUR AND TOLD HIM HE MIGHT SIT DOWN IF HE LIKED SH DID NOT OVERBURDEN THE GENTLEMAN WITH CIVILITY
6904-262305-0006 MISSIS'LL BE HERE SOON SAID SHE KETCH ENTERED THE PARLOUR AND SAT DOWN THERE WAS A FIRE IN THE GRATE BUT NO LIGHT AND THERE WERE NOT SO FAR AS KETCH COULD SEE ANY PREPARATIONS YET FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE IT DOWNSTAIRS IN THE KITCHEN SOLILOQUIZED HE
6904-262305-0007 AND THAT'S A SIGHT MORE COMFORTABLER SHE'S GONE OUT TO FETCH IT I SHOULDN'T WONDER HE CONTINUED ALLUDING TO MISSUS JENKINS AND SNIFFING AGAIN STRONGLY BUT WITHOUT RESULT THAT'S RIGHT SHE WON'T LET EM SERVE HER WITH SHORT ONIONS SHE WON'T SHE HAS A TONGUE OF HER OWN
6904-262305-0008 HE SAT ON PRETTY PATIENTLY FOR HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN TOOK THE LIBERTY OF REPLENISHING THE FIRE FROM A COAL BOX THAT STOOD THERE ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR WAS PASSED MUCH MORE IMPATIENTLY WHEN KETCH BEGAN TO GROW UNEASY AND LOSE HIMSELF IN ALL SORTS OF GRAVE CONJECTURES
6904-262305-0009 COULD SHE HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE AND FOUND THE TRIPE ALL SOLD AND SO HAD STOPPED OUT TO SUPPER HERSELF SOMEWHERE SUCH A THING AS A RUN ON THE DELICACY HAD OCCURRED MORE THAN ONCE TO KETCH'S CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND TARDY CUSTOMERS HAD BEEN SENT AWAY DISAPPOINTED
6904-262305-0010 TO WAIT IN LONGING ANTICIPATIONS FOR THE NEXT TRIPE NIGHT HE WENT INTO A COLD PERSPIRATION AT THE BARE IDEA AND WHERE WAS OLD JENKINS ALL THIS TIME THAT HE HAD NOT COME IN AND WHERE WAS JOE
6904-262305-0011 A PRETTY THING TO INVITE A GENTLEMAN OUT TO AN IMPROMPTU SUPPER AND SERVE HIM IN THIS WAY WHAT COULD THEY MEAN BY IT HE GROPED HIS WAY ROUND THE CORNER OF THE SHOP TO WHERE LAY THE KITCHEN STAIRS WHOSE POSITION HE PRETTY WELL KNEW AND CALLED HERE SALLY BETTY
6904-262305-0012 WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS AIN'T THERE NOBODY AT HOME THE GIRL HEARD AND CAME FORTH THE SAME CANDLE IN HAND WHO BE YOU CALLING TO I'D LIKE TO KNOW MY NAME'S LIDYAR IF YOU PLEASE WHERE'S YOUR MISSIS RESPONDED KETCH SUFFERING THE NAME TO DROP INTO ABEYANCE IS SHE GONE OUT FOR THE TRIPE

6904-262305-0015 BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME FIXING THE MUSTARD WHATEVER THAT MIGHT MEAN HIS SPIRITS DROPPED AGAIN AND HE GREW RATHER EXASPERATED GO UP AND ASK YOUR MISSIS HOW LONG I BE TO WAIT HE GROWLED I WAS TOLD TO COME HERE AT SEVEN FOR SUPPER AND NOW IT'S A'MOST EIGHT
6904-262305-0016 THE GIRL POSSIBLY FEELING A LITTLE CURIOSITY HERSELF CAME UP WITH HER CANDLE MASTER AIN'T SO WELL TO NIGHT REMARKED SHE HE'S GONE TO BED AND MISSIS IS PUTTING HIM A PLASTER ON HIS CHEST THE WORDS FELL AS ICE ON OLD KETCH A MUSTARD PLASTER

6904-262305-0019 A MAN IN BED WITH A PLASTER ON HIS CHEST WAS NOT LIKELY TO INVITE COMPANY TO SUPPER BEFORE HE HAD SEEN HIS WAY OUT OF THE SHOCK OR THE GIRL HAD DONE STARING AT HIM MISSUS JENKINS DESCENDED THE STAIRS AND JOINED THEM HAVING BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE CONVERSATION
6904-262305-0020 SHE HAD SLIPPED AN OLD BUFF DRESSING GOWN OVER HER CLOTHES IN HER CAPACITY OF NURSE
6904-262305-0021 HE SAYS HE'S COME TO SUPPER TRIPE AND ONIONS SAID THE GIRL UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTRODUCING MISTER KETCH AND THE SUBJECT TO HER WONDERING MISTRESS MISSUS JENKINS NOT MUCH MORE FAMOUS FOR MEEKNESS IN EXPRESSING HER OPINIONS THAN WAS KETCH TURNED HER GAZE UPON THAT GENTLEMAN
6904-262305-0022 ASKED SHE WHY I HAVE COME FOR SUPPER THAT'S WHAT I HAVE COME FOR SHRIEKED KETCH TREMBLING JENKINS INVITED ME TO SUPPER TRIPE AND ONIONS AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT ALL MEANS AND WHERE THE SUPPER IS YOU ARE GOING INTO YOUR DOTAGE
6904-262305-0023 SAID MISSUS JENKINS WITH AN AMOUNT OF SCORN SO GREAT THAT IT EXASPERATED KETCH AS MUCH AS THE WORDS THEMSELVES YOU'LL BE WANTING A LUNATIC ASYLUM NEXT TRIPE AND ONIONS IF JENKINS WAS TO HINT AT SUCH A THING AS A PLATE OF TRIPE COMING INSIDE MY HOUSE I'D TRIPE HIM
6904-262305-0024 THERE'S NOTHING I HAVE SUCH A HATRED TO AS TRIPE AND HE KNOWS IT IS THIS THE WAY TO TREAT A MAN FOAMED KETCH DISAPPOINTMENT AND HUNGER DRIVING HIM ALMOST INTO THE STATE HINTED AT BY MISSUS JENKINS
6904-262305-0025 JOE JENKINS SENDS ME DOWN A NOTE AN HOUR AGO TO COME HERE TO SUPPER WITH HIS OLD FATHER AND IT WAS TO BE TRIPE AND ONIONS IT IS TRIPE NIGHT HE CONTINUED RATHER WANDERING FROM THE POINT OF ARGUMENT AS TEARS FILLED HIS EYES
6904-262305-0026 HERE LYDIA OPEN THE DOOR AND LET HIM OUT CRIED MISSUS JENKINS WAVING HER HAND IMPERATIVELY TOWARDS IT AND WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN AT WITH YOUR FACE AGAIN CONTINUED SHE AS THE CANDLE HELD BY THAT DAMSEL REFLECTED ITS LIGHT ONE CAN'T SEE IT FOR COLLY
6904-262305-0027 IF I DO PUT YOU INTO THAT MASK I HAVE THREATENED YOU WON'T LIKE IT GIRL HOLD YOUR TONGUE OLD KETCH OR I'LL CALL MISTER HARPER DOWN TO YOU WRITE A NOTE WHAT ELSE HE HAS WROTE NO NOTE HE HAS BEEN TOO SUFFERING THE LAST FEW HOURS TO THINK OF NOTES OR OF YOU EITHER
6904-262305-0028 YOU ARE A LUNATIC IT'S MY BELIEF I SHALL BE DROVE ONE SOBBED KETCH I WAS PROMISED A TREAT OF IS THAT DOOR OPEN LYDIA THERE TAKE YOURSELF OFF MY GOODNESS ME DISTURBING MY HOUSE WITH SUCH A CRAZY ERRAND AND TAKING OLD KETCH BY THE SHOULDERS
6904-262305-0029 WHO WAS RATHER FEEBLE AND TOTTERING FROM LUMBAGO AND AGE MISSUS JENKINS POLITELY MARSHALLED HIM OUTSIDE AND CLOSED THE DOOR UPON HIM INSOLENT OLD FELLOW SHE EXCLAIMED TO HER HUSBAND TO WHOM SHE WENT AT ONCE AND RELATED THE OCCURRENCE
6904-262305-0030 I WONDER WHAT HE'LL PRETEND HE HAS NEXT FROM YOU A NOTE OF INVITATION INDEED MY DEAR SAID JENKINS REVOLVING THE NEWS AND SPEAKING AS WELL AS HIS CHEST WOULD ALLOW HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TRICK PLAYED HIM BY THE YOUNG COLLEGE GENTLEMEN WE SHOULD NOT BE TOO HARD UPON THE POOR OLD MAN
6904-262305-0031 HE'S NOT VERY AGREEABLE OR GOOD TEMPERED I'M AFRAID IT MUST BE ALLOWED BUT I'D NOT HAVE SENT HIM AWAY WITHOUT A BIT OF SUPPER MY DEAR I DARE SAY YOU'D NOT RETORTED MISSUS JENKINS ALL THE WORLD KNOWS YOU ARE SOFT ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING I HAVE SENT HIM AWAY WITH A FLEA IN HIS EAR
6904-262305-0032 THAT'S WHAT I HAVE DONE MISTER KETCH HAD AT LENGTH COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION THE INVITATION MUST BE THE WORK OF THE COLLEGE GENTLEMEN ONLY FANCY THE UNHAPPY MAN STANDING OUTSIDE MISSUS JENKINS'S INHOSPITABLE DOOR DECEIVED BETRAYED FAINTING FOR SUPPER
6904-262305-0033 DONE OUT OF THE DELICIOUS TRIPE AND ONIONS HE LEANED AGAINST THE SHUTTERS AND GAVE VENT TO A PROLONGED AND PITEOUS HOWL IT MIGHT HAVE DRAWN TEARS FROM A STONE IN A FRAME OF MIND THAT WAS NOT ENVIABLE HE TURNED HIS STEPS HOMEWARD CLASPING HIS HANDS UPON HIS EMPTY STOMACH
6904-262305-0034 AND VOWING THE MOST INTENSE VENGEANCE UPON THE COLLEGE BOYS THE OCCURRENCE NATURALLY CAUSED HIM TO CAST BACK HIS THOUGHTS TO THAT OTHER TRICK THE LOCKING HIM INTO THE CLOISTERS IN WHICH JENKINS HAD BEEN A FELLOW VICTIM AND HE DOUBLED HIS FISTS IN IMPOTENT ANGER
6904-262305-0035 THIS COMES OF THEIR NOT HAVING BEEN FLOGGED FOR THAT HE GROANED ENGAGED IN THESE REFLECTIONS OF GALL AND BITTERNESS OLD KETCH GAINED HIS LODGE UNLOCKED IT AND ENTERED NO WONDER THAT HE TURNED HIS EYES UPON THE CLOISTER KEYS THE REMINISCENCE BEING SO STRONG WITHIN HIM
6904-262305-0036 BUT TO SAY HE TURNED HIS EYES UPON THE CLOISTER KEYS IS A MERE FIGURE OF SPEECH NO KEYS WERE THERE KETCH STOOD A STATUE TRANSFIXED AND STARED AS HARD AS THE FLICKERING BLAZE FROM HIS DYING FIRE WOULD ALLOW HIM
6904-262305-0037 SEIZING A MATCH BOX HE STRUCK A LIGHT AND HELD IT TO THE HOOK THE KEYS WERE NOT THERE KETCH WAS NO CONJUROR AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM TO SUSPECT THAT THE KEYS HAD BEEN REMOVED BEFORE HIS OWN DEPARTURE HOW HAD THEM WICKED ONES GOT IN HE FOAMED
6904-262305-0038 HAD THEY FORCED HIS WINDER HAD THEY TOOK A SKELETON KEY TO HIS DOOR HAD THEY COME DOWN THE CHIMBLEY THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ALL THREE EXPLOITS AND THE MORE SOOT THEY COLLECTED ABOUT EM IN THE DESCENT THE BETTER THEY'D LIKE IT HE DIDN'T THINK THEY'D MIND A LITTLE FIRE
6904-262305-0039 IT WAS THAT INSOLENT BYWATER OR THAT YOUNG VILLAIN TOD YORKE OR THAT UNDAUNTED TOM CHANNING OR PERHAPS ALL THREE LEAGUED TOGETHER NOTHING WOULDN'T TAME THEM HE EXAMINED THE WINDOW HE EXAMINED THE DOOR HE CAST A GLANCE UP THE CHIMNEY
6904-262305-0040 NOTHING HOWEVER APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED OR DISTURBED AND THERE WAS NO SOOT ON THE FLOOR CUTTING HIMSELF A PIECE OF BREAD AND CHEESE LAMENTING AT ITS DRYNESS AND EATING IT AS HE WENT ALONG HE PROCEEDED OUT AGAIN LOCKING UP HIS LODGE AS BEFORE
6904-262305-0041 OF COURSE HE BENT HIS STEPS TO THE CLOISTERS GOING TO THE WEST GATE AND THERE PERHAPS TO HIS SURPRISE PERHAPS NOT HE FOUND THE GATE LOCKED JUST AS HE MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT HIMSELF THAT VERY EVENING AND THE KEYS HANGING INGENIOUSLY BY MEANS OF THE STRING FROM ONE OF THE STUDDED NAILS
6904-262305-0042 RIGHT OVER THE KEYHOLE THERE AIN'T A BOY IN THE SCHOOL BUT WHAT'LL COME TO BE HUNG DANCED OLD KETCH IN HIS RAGE HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED NOT TO FIND THE KEYS BUT TO GO TO THE HEAD MASTER WITH A STORY OF THEIR THEFT IT WAS POSSIBLE IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT
6904-262305-0043 GOING KEYS IN HAND THE MASTER MIGHT REFUSE TO BELIEVE HIS TALE AWAY HE HOBBLED AND ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE HEAD MASTER CHECK THE FIRST THE MASTER WAS NOT AT HOME HE HAD GONE TO A DINNER PARTY THE OTHER MASTERS LIVED AT A DISTANCE AND KETCH'S OLD LEGS WERE ACHING
6904-262305-0044 WHAT WAS HE TO DO MAKE HIS COMPLAINT TO SOME ONE HE WAS DETERMINED UPON THE NEW SENIOR HUNTLEY LIVED TOO FAR OFF FOR HIS LUMBAGO SO HE TURNED HIS STEPS TO THE NEXT SENIOR'S TOM CHANNING AND DEMANDED TO SEE HIM TOM HEARD THE STORY WHICH WAS GIVEN HIM IN DETAIL
6904-262305-0045 HE TOLD KETCH AND WITH TRUTH THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT WOULD MAKE INQUIRIES IN THE MORNING KETCH WAS FAIN TO DEPART AND TOM RETURNED TO THE SITTING ROOM AND THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR IN A BURST OF LAUGHTER WHAT IS THE MATTER THEY ASKED THE PRIMEST LARK RETURNED TOM
6904-262305-0046 SOME OF THE FELLOWS HAVE BEEN SENDING KETCH AN INVITATION TO SUP AT JENKINS'S OFF TRIPE AND ONIONS AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE HE FOUND IT WAS A HOAX AND MISSUS JENKINS TURNED HIM OUT AGAIN THAT'S WHAT MASTER CHARLEY MUST HAVE GONE AFTER HAMISH TURNED ROUND WHERE IS CHARLEY BY THE WAY
