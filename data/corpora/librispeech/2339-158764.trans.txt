2339-158764-0000 WOULD HE HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL WOMEN WHEN THEY ARE FOND OF MEN DO THINK MUCH OF MEN'S COMFORT IN SMALL MATTERS AND MEN ARE APT TO TAKE THE GOOD THINGS PROVIDED ALMOST AS A MATTER OF COURSE
2339-158764-0001 HAVING LEFT LONDON OVER NIGHT BY THE LIMITED MAIL TRAIN THE PONY AT ONCE PRESENTED ITSELF TO THEM IT WAS A LITTLE SHAGGY BLACK BEAST WITH A BOY ALMOST AS SHAGGY AS ITSELF BUT THEY WERE BOTH GOOD OF THEIR KIND OH YOU'RE THE LADDIE WITH THE POWNIE ARE YOU SAID FRANK
2339-158764-0002 IN ANSWER TO AN ANNOUNCEMENT MADE TO HIM BY THE BOY HE DID AT ONCE PERCEIVE THAT LIZZIE HAD TAKEN NOTICE OF THE WORD IN HIS NOTE IN WHICH HE HAD SUGGESTED THAT SOME MEANS OF GETTING OVER TO PORTRAY WOULD BE NEEDED
2339-158764-0003 HIS FRIEND WAS A MAN A COUPLE OF YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF
2339-158764-0004 BUT WHO WAS NEVERTHELESS A CLEVER DILIGENT WELL INSTRUCTED MAN
2339-158764-0005 HE WAS NOT MUCH KNOWN AS A SPORTSMAN
2339-158764-0006 BUT HE DEARLY LOVED THE HILLS AND FRESH AIR AND THE FEW GROUSE WHICH WERE OR WERE NOT ON LADY EUSTACE'S MOUNTAINS WOULD GO AS FAR WITH HIM AS THEY WOULD WITH ANY MAN BEFORE HE HAD CONSENTED TO COME WITH FRANK
2339-158764-0007 TILL HE HAD BEEN ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NO OFFICER ATTACHED TO THE ESTATE WORTHY OF SUCH A NAME
2339-158764-0008 I DON'T CLEARLY KNOW WHAT A GILLIE IS HE SAID IN ANSWER TO ONE OF FRANK'S EXPLANATIONS IF A GILLIE MEANS A LAD WITHOUT ANY BREECHES ON I DON'T MIND
2339-158764-0009 AND HERRIOT HAD COME GREYSTOCK BROUGHT WITH HIM TWO GUNS TWO FISHING RODS A MAN SERVANT
2339-158764-0010 ARTHUR HERRIOT WHOM THE ATTORNEYS HAD NOT YET LOVED BROUGHT SOME VERY THICK BOOTS
2339-158764-0011 DIGEST OF THE COMMON LAW THE BEST OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION CONSISTS IN THIS
2339-158764-0012 AN ASPIRANT MUST LEARN EVERYTHING BUT A MAN MAY MAKE HIS FORTUNE AT IT AND KNOW ALMOST NOTHING HE MAY EXAMINE A WITNESS WITH JUDGMENT SEE THROUGH A CASE WITH PRECISION
2339-158764-0013 AND YET BE ALTOGETHER IGNORANT OF LAW BUT HE MUST BE BELIEVED TO BE A VERY PUNDIT BEFORE HE WILL GET A CHANCE OF EXERCISING HIS JUDGMENT HIS PRECISION OR HIS ELOQUENCE THE MEN WHOSE NAMES
2339-158764-0014 BUT TILL THAT BLESSED TIME HAS COME
2339-158764-0015 GREYSTOCK NEVER THOUGHT OF THE LAW NOW UNLESS HE HAD SOME SPECIAL CASE IN HAND
2339-158764-0016 THEN HE STARTED AND HERRIOT AT ONCE WENT TO WORK ON STONE AND TODDY WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH HE HAD TRAVELLED ALL NIGHT
2339-158764-0017 SO ALSO HAD FRANK TRAVELLED ALL NIGHT BUT THE PONY AND THE FRESH AIR KEPT HIM AWAKE THE BOY HAD OFFERED TO GO WITH HIM BUT THAT HE HAD ALTOGETHER REFUSED AND THEREFORE TO HIS OTHER CARES WAS ADDED THAT OF FINDING HIS WAY THE SWEEP OF THE VALLEYS HOWEVER IS LONG AND NOT ABRUPT
2339-158764-0018 THROUGH A GAP IN A CERTAIN WALL WHICH LAY HALF WAY BETWEEN THE COTTAGE AND THE CASTLE HE WAS THINKING OF THE WORK IN HAND
2339-158764-0019 WHEN THROUGH THAT HE ASCENDED THE HILL FOR TWO MILES
2339-158764-0020 AND PORTRAY CASTLE LYING AS IT SEEMED TO HIM AT THAT DISTANCE CLOSE UPON THE SEA SHORE UPON MY WORD LIZZIE HAS NOT DONE BADLY FOR HERSELF HE SAID ALMOST ALOUD AS HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE FAIR SIGHT BENEATH HIM AND ROUND UPON THE MOUNTAINS AND REMEMBERED THAT
2339-158764-0021 FOR HER LIFE AT LEAST IT WAS ALL HERS AND AFTER HER DEATH WOULD BELONG TO HER SON WHAT MORE DOES ANY HUMAN BEING DESIRE OF SUCH A PROPERTY THAN THAT HE RODE DOWN TO THE GREAT DOORWAY THE MOUNTAIN TRACK WHICH FELL ON TO THE ROAD ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE CASTLE HAVING BEEN PLAIN ENOUGH
2339-158764-0022 GOWRAN HAD WATCHED THE PONY COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AND HAD DESIRED TO SEE OF WHAT LIKE WAS HER LEDDYSHIP'S COUSIN IN TELLING THE WHOLE TRUTH OF MISTER GOWRAN IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE THOUGHT THAT HIS LATE MASTER HAD MADE A VERY GREAT MISTAKE IN THE MATTER OF HIS MARRIAGE HE COULD NOT IMAGINE BAD THINGS ENOUGH OF LADY EUSTACE
2339-158764-0023 THE NAME OF ADMIRAL GREYSTOCK AS HAVING BEEN THE FATHER OF HIS MISTRESS HAD INDEED REACHED HIS EARS BUT ANDY GOWRAN WAS A SUSPICIOUS MAN
2339-158764-0024 OR HAVING HAD A WIFE IT'S MY FER RM OPEENION SHE'S JIST NAEBODY AND WAUR HE HAD SAID MORE THAN ONCE TO HIS OWN WIFE NODDING HIS HEAD WITH GREAT EMPHASIS AT THE LAST WORD HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THEREFORE TO SEE HER LEDDYSHIP'S COUSIN
2339-158764-0025 MISTER GOWRAN THOUGHT THAT HE KNEW A GENTLEMAN WHEN HE SAW ONE HE THOUGHT ALSO THAT HE KNEW A LADY AND THAT HE DIDN'T SEE ONE WHEN HE WAS ENGAGED WITH HIS MISTRESS COUSIN INDEED
2339-158764-0026 SO MISTER GOWRAN WAS ON THE GRAND SWEEP BEFORE THE GARDEN GATE AND TOOK THE PONY FROM FRANK'S HAND
2339-158764-0027 MISTER GOWRAN PERCEIVED THAT FRANK WAS A GENTLEMAN AND WAS DISAPPOINTED
2339-158764-0028 OH EVER SO WICKED MISTER GOWRAN WHO WAS A STERN MORALIST WAS CERTAINLY DISAPPOINTED AT FRANK'S APPEARANCE
2339-158764-0029 AT SOME CORNER OF THE CASTLE WHICH SEEMED A LONG WAY FROM THE GREAT DOOR IT WAS A CHEERFUL LITTLE ROOM WITH CHINTZ CURTAINS
2339-158764-0030 THE WIDE EXPANSE OF GLITTERING WAVES
