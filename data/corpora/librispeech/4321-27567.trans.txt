4321-27567-0000 HOW LITTLE GLUCK SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER AND HOW HE PROSPERED THEREIN WITH OTHER MATTERS OF INTEREST WHEN GLUCK FOUND THAT SCHWARTZ DID NOT COME BACK HE WAS VERY SORRY AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
4321-27567-0001 HE HAD NO MONEY AND WAS OBLIGED TO GO AND HIRE HIMSELF AGAIN TO THE GOLDSMITH WHO WORKED HIM VERY HARD AND GAVE HIM VERY LITTLE MONEY
4321-27567-0002 AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO AND TRY HIS FORTUNE WITH THE GOLDEN RIVER THE LITTLE KING LOOKED VERY KIND THOUGHT HE I DON'T THINK HE WILL TURN ME INTO A BLACK STONE SO HE WENT TO THE PRIEST
4321-27567-0003 THEN GLUCK TOOK SOME BREAD IN HIS BASKET
4321-27567-0004 AND SET OFF VERY EARLY FOR THE MOUNTAINS
4321-27567-0005 IT WAS TWENTY TIMES WORSE FOR HIM WHO WAS NEITHER SO STRONG NOR SO PRACTICED ON THE MOUNTAINS HE HAD SEVERAL VERY BAD FALLS LOST HIS BASKET AND BREAD AND WAS VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED AT THE STRANGE NOISES UNDER THE ICE
4321-27567-0006 HE LAY A LONG TIME TO REST ON THE GRASS AFTER HE HAD GOT OVER
4321-27567-0007 WHEN HE HAD CLIMBED FOR AN HOUR HE GOT DREADFULLY THIRSTY AND WAS GOING TO DRINK LIKE HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE SAW AN OLD MAN COMING DOWN THE PATH ABOVE HIM LOOKING VERY FEEBLE AND LEANING ON A STAFF
4321-27567-0008 WHY SON SAID THE OLD MAN I AM FAINT WITH THIRST GIVE ME SOME OF THAT WATER THEN GLUCK LOOKED AT HIM AND WHEN HE SAW THAT HE WAS PALE AND WEARY
4321-27567-0009 HE GAVE HIM THE WATER ONLY PRAY DON'T DRINK IT ALL SAID GLUCK BUT THE OLD MAN DRANK A GREAT DEAL AND GAVE HIM BACK THE BOTTLE TWO THIRDS EMPTY THEN HE BADE HIM GOOD SPEED
4321-27567-0010 AND GLUCK WENT ON AGAIN MERRILY AND THE PATH BECAME EASIER TO HIS FEET AND TWO OR THREE BLADES OF GRASS APPEARED UPON IT AND SOME GRASSHOPPERS BEGAN SINGING ON THE BANK BESIDE IT AND GLUCK THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER HEARD SUCH MERRY SINGING
4321-27567-0011 THEN HE WENT ON FOR ANOTHER HOUR
4321-27567-0012 BUT AS HE RAISED THE FLASK HE SAW A LITTLE CHILD LYING PANTING BY THE ROADSIDE
4321-27567-0013 THEN GLUCK STRUGGLED WITH HIMSELF AND DETERMINED TO BEAR THE THIRST A LITTLE LONGER AND HE PUT THE BOTTLE TO THE CHILD'S LIPS AND IT DRANK IT ALL BUT A FEW DROPS
4321-27567-0014 THEN IT SMILED ON HIM AND GOT UP AND RAN DOWN THE HILL AND GLUCK LOOKED AFTER IT TILL IT BECAME AS SMALL AS A LITTLE STAR AND THEN TURNED AND BEGAN CLIMBING AGAIN
4321-27567-0015 AND THEN THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF SWEET FLOWERS GROWING ON THE ROCKS BRIGHT GREEN MOSS WITH PALE PINK STARRY FLOWERS AND SOFT BELLED GENTIANS MORE BLUE THAN THE SKY AT ITS DEEPEST
4321-27567-0016 AND PURE WHITE TRANSPARENT LILIES AND CRIMSON AND PURPLE BUTTERFLIES DARTED HITHER AND THITHER AND THE SKY SENT DOWN SUCH PURE LIGHT THAT GLUCK HAD NEVER FELT SO HAPPY IN HIS LIFE
4321-27567-0017 HIS THIRST BECAME INTOLERABLE AGAIN AND WHEN HE LOOKED AT HIS BOTTLE HE SAW THAT THERE WERE ONLY FIVE OR SIX DROPS LEFT IN IT AND HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO DRINK AND AS HE WAS HANGING THE FLASK TO HIS BELT AGAIN
4321-27567-0018 HE SAW A LITTLE DOG LYING ON THE ROCKS GASPING FOR BREATH JUST AS HANS HAD SEEN IT ON THE DAY OF HIS ASCENT AND GLUCK STOPPED AND LOOKED AT IT AND THEN AT THE GOLDEN RIVER NOT FIVE HUNDRED YARDS ABOVE HIM
4321-27567-0019 AND HE THOUGHT OF THE DWARF'S WORDS THAT NO ONE COULD SUCCEED EXCEPT IN HIS FIRST ATTEMPT
4321-27567-0020 POOR BEASTIE SAID GLUCK IT'LL BE DEAD WHEN I COME DOWN AGAIN IF I DON'T HELP IT THEN HE LOOKED CLOSER AND CLOSER AT IT AND ITS EYE TURNED ON HIM SO MOURNFULLY
4321-27567-0021 CONFOUND THE KING AND HIS GOLD TOO SAID GLUCK AND HE OPENED THE FLASK AND POURED ALL THE WATER INTO THE DOG'S MOUTH THE DOG SPRANG UP AND STOOD ON ITS HIND LEGS
4321-27567-0022 ITS TAIL DISAPPEARED ITS EARS BECAME LONG LONGER SILKY GOLDEN ITS NOSE BECAME VERY RED ITS EYES BECAME VERY TWINKLING IN THREE SECONDS THE DOG WAS GONE
4321-27567-0023 AND BEFORE GLUCK STOOD HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER THANK YOU SAID THE MONARCH
4321-27567-0024 FOR GLUCK SHOWED MANIFEST SYMPTOMS OF CONSTERNATION AT THIS UNLOOKED FOR REPLY TO HIS LAST OBSERVATION WHY DIDN'T YOU COME BEFORE CONTINUED THE DWARF
4321-27567-0025 INSTEAD OF SENDING ME THOSE RASCALLY BROTHERS OF YOURS FOR ME TO HAVE THE TROUBLE OF TURNING INTO STONES VERY HARD STONES THEY MAKE TOO O DEAR ME SAID GLUCK HAVE YOU REALLY BEEN SO CRUEL
4321-27567-0026 CRUEL SAID THE DWARF THEY POURED UNHOLY WATER INTO MY STREAM DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M GOING TO ALLOW THAT WHY SAID GLUCK I AM SURE SIR
4321-27567-0027 BUT AND HIS COUNTENANCE GREW STERN AS HE SPOKE THE WATER WHICH HAS BEEN REFUSED TO THE CRY OF THE WEARY AND DYING IS UNHOLY THOUGH IT HAD BEEN BLESSED BY EVERY SAINT IN HEAVEN
4321-27567-0028 AND THE WATER WHICH IS FOUND IN THE VESSEL OF MERCY IS HOLY THOUGH IT HAD BEEN DEFILED WITH CORPSES SO SAYING THE DWARF STOOPED AND PLUCKED A LILY THAT GREW AT HIS FEET
4321-27567-0029 AND THE DWARF SHOOK THEM INTO THE FLASK WHICH GLUCK HELD IN HIS HAND CAST THESE INTO THE RIVER HE SAID AND DESCEND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS INTO THE TREASURE VALLEY AND SO GOOD SPEED
4321-27567-0030 AS HE SPOKE THE FIGURE OF THE DWARF BECAME INDISTINCT
4321-27567-0031 AND GLUCK CLIMBED TO THE BRINK OF THE GOLDEN RIVER AND ITS WAVES WERE AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL AND AS BRILLIANT AS THE SUN
4321-27567-0032 THERE OPENED WHERE THEY FELL A SMALL CIRCULAR WHIRLPOOL INTO WHICH THE WATERS DESCENDED WITH A MUSICAL NOISE GLUCK STOOD WATCHING IT FOR SOME TIME VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED
4321-27567-0033 BECAUSE NOT ONLY THE RIVER WAS NOT TURNED INTO GOLD BUT ITS WATERS SEEMED MUCH DIMINISHED IN QUANTITY YET HE OBEYED HIS FRIEND THE DWARF AND DESCENDED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS TOWARDS THE TREASURE VALLEY
4321-27567-0034 AND AS HE WENT HE THOUGHT HE HEARD THE NOISE OF WATER WORKING ITS WAY UNDER THE GROUND AND WHEN HE CAME IN SIGHT OF THE TREASURE VALLEY BEHOLD A RIVER LIKE THE GOLDEN RIVER WAS SPRINGING FROM A NEW CLEFT OF THE ROCKS ABOVE IT
4321-27567-0035 AND WAS FLOWING IN INNUMERABLE STREAMS AMONG THE DRY HEAPS OF RED SAND AND AS GLUCK GAZED FRESH GRASS SPRANG BESIDE THE NEW STREAMS
4321-27567-0036 AND CREEPING PLANTS GREW AND CLIMBED AMONG THE MOISTENING SOIL YOUNG FLOWERS OPENED SUDDENLY ALONG THE RIVERSIDES AS STARS LEAP OUT WHEN TWILIGHT IS DEEPENING AND THICKETS OF MYRTLE AND TENDRILS OF VINE
4321-27567-0037 AND THUS THE TREASURE VALLEY BECAME A GARDEN AGAIN AND THE INHERITANCE WHICH HAD BEEN LOST BY CRUELTY WAS REGAINED BY LOVE AND GLUCK WENT AND DWELT IN THE VALLEY AND THE POOR WERE NEVER DRIVEN FROM HIS DOOR
4321-27567-0038 SO THAT HIS BARNS BECAME FULL OF CORN AND HIS HOUSE OF TREASURE AND FOR HIM THE RIVER HAD ACCORDING TO THE DWARF'S PROMISE BECOME A RIVER OF GOLD
4321-27567-0039 AND TO THIS DAY THE INHABITANTS OF THE VALLEY POINT OUT THE PLACE WHERE THE THREE DROPS OF HOLY DEW WERE CAST INTO THE STREAM AND TRACE THE COURSE OF THE GOLDEN RIVER UNDER THE GROUND UNTIL IT EMERGES IN THE TREASURE VALLEY
4321-27567-0040 AND AT THE TOP OF THE CATARACT OF THE GOLDEN RIVER ARE STILL TO BE SEEN TWO BLACK STONES ROUND WHICH THE WATERS HOWL MOURNFULLY EVERY DAY AT SUNSET AND THESE STONES ARE STILL CALLED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE VALLEY
