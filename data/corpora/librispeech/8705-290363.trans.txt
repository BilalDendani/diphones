8705-290363-0000 OF COLLECTIVE IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES ONE A COLLECTIVE IDEA IS ONE IDEA BESIDES THESE COMPLEX IDEAS OF SEVERAL SINGLE SUBSTANCES AS OF MAN HORSE
8705-290363-0001 WHICH I SO CALL BECAUSE SUCH IDEAS ARE MADE UP OF MANY PARTICULAR SUBSTANCES CONSIDERED TOGETHER AS UNITED INTO ONE IDEA AND WHICH SO JOINED ARE LOOKED ON AS ONE
8705-290363-0002 THE IDEA OF SUCH A COLLECTION OF MEN AS MAKE AN ARMY THOUGH CONSISTING OF A GREAT NUMBER OF DISTINCT SUBSTANCES IS AS MUCH ONE IDEA AS THE IDEA OF A MAN AND THE GREAT COLLECTIVE IDEA OF ALL BODIES WHATSOEVER SIGNIFIED BY THE NAME WORLD
8705-290363-0003 IS AS MUCH ONE IDEA AS THE IDEA OF ANY THE LEAST PARTICLE OF MATTER IN IT IT SUFFICING TO THE UNITY OF ANY IDEA THAT IT BE CONSIDERED AS ONE REPRESENTATION OR PICTURE THOUGH MADE UP OF EVER SO MANY PARTICULARS TWO
8705-290363-0004 BY THE SAME FACULTY MAKE THE COMPLEX IDEAS OF PARTICULAR SUBSTANCES CONSISTING OF AN AGGREGATE OF DIVERS SIMPLE IDEAS UNITED IN ONE SUBSTANCE AND AS THE MIND BY PUTTING TOGETHER THE REPEATED IDEAS OF UNITY MAKES THE COLLECTIVE MODE
8705-290363-0005 AS A TROOP AN ARMY A SWARM A CITY A FLEET EACH OF WHICH EVERY ONE FINDS THAT HE REPRESENTS TO HIS OWN MIND BY ONE IDEA IN ONE VIEW AND SO UNDER THAT NOTION CONSIDERS THOSE SEVERAL THINGS AS PERFECTLY ONE
8705-290363-0006 AS ONE SHIP OR ONE ATOM NOR IS IT HARDER TO CONCEIVE HOW AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN SHOULD MAKE ONE IDEA THAN HOW A MAN SHOULD MAKE ONE IDEA
8705-290363-0007 IT BEING AS EASY TO THE MIND TO UNITE INTO ONE THE IDEA OF A GREAT NUMBER OF MEN AND CONSIDER IT AS ONE AS IT IS TO UNITE INTO ONE PARTICULAR ALL THE DISTINCT IDEAS THAT MAKE UP THE COMPOSITION OF A MAN AND CONSIDER THEM ALL TOGETHER AS ONE
8705-290363-0008 THREE ARTIFICIAL THINGS THAT ARE MADE UP OF DISTINCT SUBSTANCES ARE OUR COLLECTIVE IDEAS AMONGST SUCH KIND OF COLLECTIVE IDEAS ARE TO BE COUNTED MOST PART OF ARTIFICIAL THINGS
8705-290363-0009 THEY ARE BUT THE ARTIFICIAL DRAUGHTS OF THE MIND BRINGING THINGS VERY REMOTE AND INDEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER INTO ONE VIEW THE BETTER TO CONTEMPLATE AND DISCOURSE ON THEM UNITED INTO ONE CONCEPTION AND SIGNIFIED BY ONE NAME
8705-290363-0010 FOR THERE ARE NO THINGS SO REMOTE NOR SO CONTRARY WHICH THE MIND CANNOT BY THIS ART OF COMPOSITION BRING INTO ONE IDEA AS IS VISIBLE IN THAT SIGNIFIED BY THE NAME UNIVERSE
8705-290363-0011 AND CARRIES ITS VIEW FROM ONE TO THE OTHER THIS IS AS THE WORDS IMPORT RELATION AND RESPECT AND THE DENOMINATIONS GIVEN TO POSITIVE THINGS INTIMATING THAT RESPECT AND SERVING AS MARKS TO LEAD THE THOUGHTS BEYOND THE SUBJECT ITSELF DENOMINATED
8705-290363-0012 V G WHEN I CONSIDER HIM AS A MAN I HAVE NOTHING IN MY MIND BUT THE COMPLEX IDEA OF THE SPECIES MAN SO LIKEWISE WHEN I SAY CAIUS IS A WHITE MAN
8705-290363-0013 I INTIMATE SOME OTHER PERSON AND WHEN I GIVE HIM THE NAME WHITER I INTIMATE SOME OTHER THING IN BOTH CASES MY THOUGHT IS LED TO SOMETHING BEYOND CAIUS AND THERE ARE TWO THINGS BROUGHT INTO CONSIDERATION
8705-290363-0014 AS IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED INSTANCE THE CONTRACT AND CEREMONY OF MARRIAGE WITH SEMPRONIA IS THE OCCASION OF THE DENOMINATION AND RELATION OF HUSBAND AND THE COLOUR WHITE THE OCCASION WHY HE IS SAID TO BE WHITER THAN FREE STONE
8705-290363-0015 WITH A RECIPROCAL INTIMATION AS FATHER AND SON BIGGER AND LESS CAUSE AND EFFECT ARE VERY OBVIOUS TO EVERY ONE AND EVERYBODY AT FIRST SIGHT PERCEIVES THE RELATION FOR FATHER AND SON HUSBAND AND WIFE AND SUCH OTHER CORRELATIVE TERMS
8705-290363-0016 THAT UPON THE NAMING OF EITHER OF THEM THE THOUGHTS ARE PRESENTLY CARRIED BEYOND THE THING SO NAMED AND NOBODY OVERLOOKS OR DOUBTS OF A RELATION WHERE IT IS SO PLAINLY INTIMATED BUT WHERE LANGUAGES HAVE FAILED TO GIVE CORRELATIVE NAMES
8705-290363-0017 THERE THE RELATION IS NOT ALWAYS SO EASILY TAKEN NOTICE OF CONCUBINE IS NO DOUBT A RELATIVE NAME AS WELL AS WIFE BUT IN LANGUAGES WHERE THIS AND THE LIKE WORDS HAVE NOT A CORRELATIVE TERM THERE PEOPLE ARE NOT SO APT TO TAKE THEM TO BE SO
8705-290363-0018 AS WANTING THAT EVIDENT MARK OF RELATION WHICH IS BETWEEN CORRELATIVES WHICH SEEM TO EXPLAIN ONE ANOTHER AND NOT TO BE ABLE TO EXIST BUT TOGETHER HENCE IT IS THAT MANY OF THOSE NAMES WHICH DULY CONSIDERED DO INCLUDE EVIDENT RELATIONS
8705-290363-0019 HAVE BEEN CALLED EXTERNAL DENOMINATIONS BUT ALL NAMES THAT ARE MORE THAN EMPTY SOUNDS MUST SIGNIFY SOME IDEA WHICH IS EITHER IN THE THING TO WHICH THE NAME IS APPLIED AND THEN IT IS POSITIVE
8705-290363-0020 AND IS LOOKED ON AS UNITED TO AND EXISTING IN THE THING TO WHICH THE DENOMINATION IS GIVEN OR ELSE IT ARISES FROM THE RESPECT THE MIND FINDS IN IT TO SOMETHING DISTINCT FROM IT WITH WHICH IT CONSIDERS IT AND THEN IT INCLUDES A RELATION
8705-290363-0021 THREE SOME SEEMINGLY ABSOLUTE TERMS CONTAIN RELATIONS ANOTHER SORT OF RELATIVE TERMS THERE IS WHICH ARE NOT LOOKED ON TO BE EITHER RELATIVE OR SO MUCH AS EXTERNAL DENOMINATIONS
8705-290363-0022 OF HIS OWN KIND LET MAN BE WHAT IT WILL FIVE CHANGE OF RELATION MAY BE WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN THE THINGS RELATED THE NATURE THEREFORE OF RELATION CONSISTS IN THE REFERRING OR COMPARING TWO THINGS ONE TO ANOTHER
8705-290363-0023 FROM WHICH COMPARISON ONE OF BOTH COMES TO BE DENOMINATED AND IF EITHER OF THOSE THINGS BE REMOVED OR CEASE TO BE THE RELATION CEASES AND THE DENOMINATION CONSEQUENT TO IT THOUGH THE OTHER RECEIVE IN ITSELF NO ALTERATION AT ALL
8705-290363-0024 V G CAIUS WHOM I CONSIDER TO DAY AS A FATHER CEASES TO BE SO TO MORROW ONLY BY THE DEATH OF HIS SON WITHOUT ANY ALTERATION MADE IN HIMSELF NAY BARELY BY THE MIND'S CHANGING THE OBJECT TO WHICH IT COMPARES ANYTHING
8705-290363-0025 THE SAME THING IS CAPABLE OF HAVING CONTRARY DENOMINATIONS AT THE SAME TIME V G CAIUS COMPARED TO SEVERAL PERSONS MAY TRULY BE SAID TO BE OLDER AND YOUNGER STRONGER AND WEAKER
8705-290363-0026 WHATSOEVER DOTH OR CAN EXIST OR BE CONSIDERED AS ONE THING IS POSITIVE AND SO NOT ONLY SIMPLE IDEAS AND SUBSTANCES BUT MODES ALSO ARE POSITIVE BEINGS THOUGH THE PARTS OF WHICH THEY CONSIST ARE VERY OFTEN RELATIVE ONE TO ANOTHER
8705-290363-0027 FOR THERE CAN BE NO RELATION BUT BETWIXT TWO THINGS CONSIDERED AS TWO THINGS THERE MUST ALWAYS BE IN RELATION TWO IDEAS OR THINGS EITHER IN THEMSELVES REALLY SEPARATE OR CONSIDERED AS DISTINCT AND THEN A GROUND OR OCCASION FOR THEIR COMPARISON
8705-290363-0028 SEVEN ALL THINGS CAPABLE OF RELATION CONCERNING RELATION IN GENERAL THESE THINGS MAY BE CONSIDERED FIRST THAT THERE IS NO ONE THING WHETHER SIMPLE IDEA SUBSTANCE MODE OR RELATION
8705-290363-0029 OR NAME OF EITHER OF THEM WHICH IS NOT CAPABLE OF ALMOST AN INFINITE NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS IN REFERENCE TO OTHER THINGS AND THEREFORE THIS MAKES NO SMALL PART OF MEN'S THOUGHTS AND WORDS V G
8705-290363-0030 ONE SINGLE MAN MAY AT ONCE BE CONCERNED IN AND SUSTAIN ALL THESE FOLLOWING RELATIONS AND MANY MORE VIZ FATHER BROTHER SON GRANDFATHER GRANDSON FATHER IN LAW SON IN LAW HUSBAND FRIEND ENEMY
8705-290363-0031 HE BEING CAPABLE OF AS MANY RELATIONS AS THERE CAN BE OCCASIONS OF COMPARING HIM TO OTHER THINGS IN ANY MANNER OF AGREEMENT DISAGREEMENT OR RESPECT WHATSOEVER
8705-290363-0032 EIGHT OUR IDEAS OF RELATIONS OFTEN CLEARER THAN OF THE SUBJECTS RELATED SECONDLY THIS FURTHER MAY BE CONSIDERED CONCERNING RELATION THAT THOUGH IT BE NOT CONTAINED IN THE REAL EXISTENCE OF THINGS
8705-290363-0033 BUT SOMETHING EXTRANEOUS AND SUPERINDUCED YET THE IDEAS WHICH RELATIVE WORDS STAND FOR ARE OFTEN CLEARER AND MORE DISTINCT THAN OF THOSE SUBSTANCES TO WHICH THEY DO BELONG
8705-290363-0034 AN ACCURATE COLLECTION OF SUNDRY IDEAS IS NECESSARY A MAN IF HE COMPARES TWO THINGS TOGETHER CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED NOT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS WHEREIN HE COMPARES THEM SO THAT WHEN HE COMPARES ANY THINGS TOGETHER HE CANNOT BUT HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDEA OF THAT RELATION
8705-290363-0035 THE IDEAS THEN OF RELATIONS ARE CAPABLE AT LEAST OF BEING MORE PERFECT AND DISTINCT IN OUR MINDS THAN THOSE OF SUBSTANCES BECAUSE IT IS COMMONLY HARD TO KNOW ALL THE SIMPLE IDEAS WHICH ARE REALLY IN ANY SUBSTANCE BUT FOR THE MOST PART
8705-290363-0036 FOR SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE WORDS AS WELL AS OTHERS STANDING ONLY FOR IDEAS AND THOSE BEING ALL EITHER SIMPLE OR MADE UP OF SIMPLE ONES IT SUFFICES FOR THE KNOWING THE PRECISE IDEA THE RELATIVE TERM STANDS FOR TO HAVE A CLEAR CONCEPTION
8705-290363-0037 OF THAT WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE RELATION WHICH MAY BE DONE WITHOUT HAVING A PERFECT AND CLEAR IDEA OF THE THING IT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THUS HAVING THE NOTION THAT ONE LAID THE EGG OUT OF WHICH THE OTHER WAS HATCHED I HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF THE RELATION OF DAM AND CHICK
8705-290363-0038 NINE RELATIONS ALL TERMINATE IN SIMPLE IDEAS THIRDLY THOUGH THERE BE A GREAT NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS WHEREIN THINGS MAY BE COMPARED ONE WITH ANOTHER AND SO A MULTITUDE OF RELATIONS
8705-290363-0039 AND IN SOME THAT SEEM TO BE THE MOST REMOTE FROM SENSE OR REFLECTION WHICH YET WILL APPEAR TO HAVE THEIR IDEAS FROM THENCE AND LEAVE IT PAST DOUBT THAT THE NOTIONS WE HAVE OF THEM ARE BUT CERTAIN SIMPLE IDEAS AND SO ORIGINALLY DERIVED FROM SENSE OR REFLECTION
8705-290363-0040 TEN TERMS LEADING THE MIND BEYOND THE SUBJECT DENOMINATED ARE RELATIVE FOURTHLY THAT RELATION BEING THE CONSIDERING OF ONE THING WITH ANOTHER WHICH IS EXTRINSICAL TO IT
8705-290363-0041 BLACK MERRY THOUGHTFUL THIRSTY ANGRY EXTENDED THESE AND THE LIKE ARE ALL ABSOLUTE BECAUSE THEY NEITHER SIGNIFY NOR INTIMATE ANYTHING BUT WHAT DOES OR IS SUPPOSED REALLY TO EXIST IN THE MAN THUS DENOMINATED
8705-290363-0042 BUT FATHER BROTHER KING HUSBAND
8705-290363-0043 TOGETHER WITH THE THING THEY DENOMINATE IMPLY ALSO SOMETHING ELSE SEPARATE AND EXTERIOR TO THE EXISTENCE OF THAT THING ELEVEN ALL RELATIVES MADE UP OF SIMPLE IDEAS
8705-290363-0044 HAVING LAID DOWN THESE PREMISES CONCERNING RELATION IN GENERAL I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO SHOW IN SOME INSTANCES HOW ALL THE IDEAS WE HAVE OF RELATION ARE MADE UP AS THE OTHERS ARE ONLY OF SIMPLE IDEAS AND THAT THEY ALL
8705-290363-0045 TERMINATE AT LAST IN SIMPLE IDEAS I SHALL BEGIN WITH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RELATION WHEREIN ALL THINGS THAT DO OR CAN EXIST ARE CONCERNED AND THAT IS THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT THE IDEA WHEREOF
8705-290363-0046 HOW DERIVED FROM THE TWO FOUNTAINS OF ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE SENSATION AND REFLECTION I SHALL IN THE NEXT PLACE CONSIDER CHAPTER TWENTY SIX OF CAUSE AND EFFECT AND OTHER RELATIONS ONE
8705-290363-0047 WHENCE THE IDEAS OF CAUSE AND EFFECT GOT IN THE NOTICE THAT OUR SENSES TAKE OF THE CONSTANT VICISSITUDE OF THINGS WE CANNOT BUT OBSERVE THAT SEVERAL PARTICULAR BOTH QUALITIES AND SUBSTANCES
8705-290363-0048 BEGIN TO EXIST AND THAT THEY RECEIVE THIS THEIR EXISTENCE FROM THE DUE APPLICATION AND OPERATION OF SOME OTHER BEING FROM THIS OBSERVATION WE GET OUR IDEAS OF CAUSE AND EFFECT THAT WHICH PRODUCES ANY SIMPLE OR COMPLEX IDEA
8705-290363-0049 WE DENOTE BY THE GENERAL NAME CAUSE AND THAT WHICH IS PRODUCED EFFECT THUS FINDING THAT IN THAT SUBSTANCE WHICH WE CALL WAX FLUIDITY WHICH IS A SIMPLE IDEA THAT WAS NOT IN IT BEFORE
8705-290363-0050 IS CONSTANTLY PRODUCED BY THE APPLICATION OF A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HEAT WE CALL THE SIMPLE IDEA OF HEAT IN RELATION TO FLUIDITY IN WAX THE CAUSE OF IT AND FLUIDITY THE EFFECT SO ALSO FINDING THAT THE SUBSTANCE WOOD
8705-290363-0051 WHICH IS A CERTAIN COLLECTION OF SIMPLE IDEAS SO CALLED BY THE APPLICATION OF FIRE IS TURNED INTO ANOTHER SUBSTANCE CALLED ASHES
8705-290363-0052 CONSISTING OF A COLLECTION OF SIMPLE IDEAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT COMPLEX IDEA WHICH WE CALL WOOD WE CONSIDER FIRE IN RELATION TO ASHES AS CAUSE AND THE ASHES AS EFFECT
8705-290363-0053 SO THAT WHATEVER IS CONSIDERED BY US TO CONDUCE OR OPERATE TO THE PRODUCING ANY PARTICULAR SIMPLE IDEA OR COLLECTION OF SIMPLE IDEAS WHETHER SUBSTANCE OR MODE WHICH DID NOT BEFORE EXIST
8705-290363-0054 HATH THEREBY IN OUR MINDS THE RELATION OF A CAUSE AND SO IS DENOMINATED BY US TWO CREATION GENERATION MAKING ALTERATION
8705-290363-0055 BEGIN TO BE AND AN EFFECT IS THAT WHICH HAD ITS BEGINNING FROM SOME OTHER THING THE MIND FINDS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY TO DISTINGUISH THE SEVERAL ORIGINALS OF THINGS INTO TWO SORTS FIRST WHEN THE THING IS WHOLLY MADE NEW
8705-290363-0056 SO THAT NO PART THEREOF DID EVER EXIST BEFORE AS WHEN A NEW PARTICLE OF MATTER DOTH BEGIN TO EXIST IN RERUM NATURA WHICH HAD BEFORE NO BEING AND THIS WE CALL CREATION
8705-290363-0057 SECONDLY WHEN A THING IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES WHICH DID ALL OF THEM BEFORE EXIST BUT THAT VERY THING SO CONSTITUTED OF PRE EXISTING PARTICLES WHICH CONSIDERED ALL TOGETHER MAKE UP SUCH A COLLECTION OF SIMPLE IDEAS
8705-290363-0058 HAD NOT ANY EXISTENCE BEFORE AS THIS MAN THIS EGG
8705-290363-0059 WHEN THE CAUSE IS EXTRINSICAL AND THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY A SENSIBLE SEPARATION OR JUXTA POSITION OF DISCERNIBLE PARTS WE CALL IT MAKING AND SUCH ARE ALL ARTIFICIAL THINGS WHEN ANY SIMPLE IDEA IS PRODUCED
8705-290363-0060 WHICH WAS NOT IN THAT SUBJECT BEFORE WE CALL IT ALTERATION THUS A MAN IS GENERATED A PICTURE MADE AND EITHER OF THEM ALTERED WHEN ANY NEW SENSIBLE QUALITY OR SIMPLE IDEA IS PRODUCED IN EITHER OF THEM
8705-290363-0061 IT SUFFICES TO CONSIDER ANY SIMPLE IDEA OR SUBSTANCE AS BEGINNING TO EXIST BY THE OPERATION OF SOME OTHER WITHOUT KNOWING THE MANNER OF THAT OPERATION THREE RELATIONS OF TIME
8705-290363-0062 TIME AND PLACE ARE ALSO THE FOUNDATIONS OF VERY LARGE RELATIONS AND ALL FINITE BEINGS AT LEAST ARE CONCERNED IN THEM BUT HAVING ALREADY SHOWN IN ANOTHER PLACE HOW WE GET THOSE IDEAS IT MAY SUFFICE HERE TO INTIMATE
8705-290363-0063 THAT MOST OF THE DENOMINATIONS OF THINGS RECEIVED FROM TIME ARE ONLY RELATIONS THUS WHEN ANY ONE SAYS THAT QUEEN ELIZABETH LIVED SIXTY NINE AND REIGNED FORTY FIVE YEARS THESE WORDS IMPORT ONLY THE RELATION OF THAT DURATION TO SOME OTHER
8705-290363-0064 WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR INVADED ENGLAND ABOUT THE YEAR TEN SIXTY SIX WHICH MEANS THIS THAT TAKING THE DURATION FROM OUR SAVIOUR'S TIME TILL NOW FOR ONE ENTIRE GREAT LENGTH OF TIME IT SHOWS AT WHAT DISTANCE THIS INVASION WAS FROM THE TWO EXTREMES
8705-290363-0065 AND SO DO ALL WORDS OF TIME ANSWERING TO THE QUESTION WHEN WHICH SHOW ONLY THE DISTANCE OF ANY POINT OF TIME FROM THE PERIOD OF A LONGER DURATION FROM WHICH WE MEASURE
8705-290363-0066 WHICH YET WILL WHEN CONSIDERED BE FOUND TO BE RELATIVE
8705-290363-0067 WHEREOF WE HAVE THE IDEA IN OUR MINDS THUS HAVING SETTLED IN OUR THOUGHTS THE IDEA OF THE ORDINARY DURATION OF A MAN TO BE SEVENTY YEARS WHEN WE SAY A MAN IS YOUNG WE MEAN THAT HIS AGE IS YET BUT A SMALL PART OF THAT WHICH USUALLY MEN ATTAIN TO
8705-290363-0068 AND WHEN WE DENOMINATE HIM OLD WE MEAN THAT HIS DURATION IS RAN OUT ALMOST TO THE END OF THAT WHICH MEN DO NOT USUALLY EXCEED AND SO IT IS BUT COMPARING THE PARTICULAR AGE OR DURATION OF THIS OR THAT MAN
8705-290363-0069 TO THE IDEA OF THAT DURATION WHICH WE HAVE IN OUR MINDS AS ORDINARILY BELONGING TO THAT SORT OF ANIMALS WHICH IS PLAIN IN THE APPLICATION OF THESE NAMES TO OTHER THINGS FOR A MAN IS CALLED YOUNG AT TWENTY YEARS AND VERY YOUNG AT SEVEN YEARS OLD
8705-290363-0070 BUT YET A HORSE WE CALL OLD AT TWENTY AND A DOG AT SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE IN EACH OF THESE WE COMPARE THEIR AGE TO DIFFERENT IDEAS OF DURATION WHICH ARE SETTLED IN OUR MINDS AS BELONGING TO THESE SEVERAL SORTS OF ANIMALS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE
8705-290363-0071 BUT THE SUN AND STARS THOUGH THEY HAVE OUTLASTED SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF MEN WE CALL NOT OLD BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT PERIOD GOD HATH SET TO THAT SORT OF BEINGS
8705-290363-0072 THIS TERM BELONGING PROPERLY TO THOSE THINGS WHICH WE CAN OBSERVE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THINGS BY A NATURAL DECAY TO COME TO AN END IN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND SO HAVE IN OUR MINDS AS IT WERE A STANDARD TO WHICH WE CAN COMPARE THE SEVERAL PARTS OF THEIR DURATION
8705-290363-0073 BUT AS IN DURATION SO IN EXTENSION AND BULK THERE ARE SOME IDEAS THAT ARE RELATIVE WHICH WE SIGNIFY BY NAMES THAT ARE THOUGHT POSITIVE AS GREAT AND LITTLE ARE TRULY RELATIONS FOR HERE ALSO HAVING BY OBSERVATION SETTLED IN OUR MINDS THE IDEAS
8705-290363-0074 OF THE BIGNESS OF SEVERAL SPECIES OF THINGS FROM THOSE WE HAVE BEEN MOST ACCUSTOMED TO WE MAKE THEM AS IT WERE THE STANDARDS WHEREBY TO DENOMINATE THE BULK OF OTHERS THUS WE CALL A GREAT APPLE SUCH A ONE AS IS BIGGER THAN THE ORDINARY SORT OF THOSE WE HAVE BEEN USED TO
8705-290363-0075 WHICH IS BUT A LITTLE ONE TO A FLEMING THEY TWO HAVING FROM THE DIFFERENT BREED OF THEIR COUNTRIES TAKEN SEVERAL SIZED IDEAS TO WHICH THEY COMPARE AND IN RELATION TO WHICH THEY DENOMINATE THEIR GREAT AND THEIR LITTLE SIX
8705-290363-0076 ABSOLUTE TERMS OFTEN STAND FOR RELATIONS SO LIKEWISE WEAK AND STRONG ARE BUT RELATIVE DENOMINATIONS OF POWER
8705-290363-0077 THUS WHEN WE SAY A WEAK MAN WE MEAN ONE THAT HAS NOT SO MUCH STRENGTH OR POWER TO MOVE AS USUALLY MEN HAVE OR USUALLY THOSE OF HIS SIZE HAVE WHICH IS A COMPARING HIS STRENGTH TO THE IDEA WE HAVE OF THE USUAL STRENGTH OF MEN OR MEN OF SUCH A SIZE
8705-290363-0078 THE LIKE WHEN WE SAY THE CREATURES ARE ALL WEAK THINGS WEAK THERE IS BUT A RELATIVE TERM SIGNIFYING THE DISPROPORTION THERE IS IN THE POWER OF GOD AND THE CREATURES
