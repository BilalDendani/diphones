6538-81843-0000 BY THAT TIME NIGHT HAD COME FULLY THOUGH FORTUNATELY IT WAS CLEAR BUT VERY COLD HE SAW THEN ON THE RIGHT A FAINT COIL OF SMOKE RISING AGAINST THE DUSKY SKY AND HE RODE STRAIGHT FOR IT THE SMOKE CAME FROM A STRONG DOUBLE CABIN STANDING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE ROAD
6538-81843-0001 AND THE SIGHT OF THE HEAVY LOG WALLS MADE DICK ALL THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET INSIDE THEM THE COLD HAD GROWN BITTER AND EVEN HIS HORSE SHIVERED AS HE APPROACHED TWO YELLOW CURS RUSHED FORTH AND BEGAN TO BARK FURIOUSLY SNAPPING AT THE HORSE'S HEELS THE USUAL MOUNTAIN WELCOME
6538-81843-0002 BUT WHEN A KICK FROM THE HORSE GRAZED THE EAR OF ONE OF THEM THEY KEPT AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE HELLO HELLO CALLED DICK LOUDLY THIS ALSO WAS THE USUAL MOUNTAIN NOTIFICATION THAT A GUEST HAD COME AND THE HEAVY BOARD DOOR OF THE HOUSE OPENED INWARD
6538-81843-0003 A MAN ELDERLY BUT DARK AND STRONG WITH THE HIGH CHEEK BONES OF AN INDIAN STOOD IN THE DOOR THE LIGHT OF A FIRE BLAZING IN THE FIREPLACE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WALL THROWING HIM IN RELIEF HIS HAIR WAS COAL BLACK LONG AND COARSE INCREASING HIS RESEMBLANCE TO AN INDIAN
6538-81843-0004 DICK RODE CLOSE TO THE DOOR AND WITHOUT HESITATION ASKED FOR A NIGHT'S SHELTER AND FOOD THIS WAS HIS INALIENABLE RIGHT IN THE HILLS OR MOUNTAINS OF HIS STATE AND HE WOULD BE A STRANGE MAN INDEED WHO WOULD REFUSE IT
6538-81843-0005 THE MAN SHARPLY BADE THE DOGS BE SILENT AND THEY RETREATED BEHIND THE HOUSE THEIR TAILS DROOPING THEN HE SAID TO DICK IN A TONE THAT WAS NOT WITHOUT HOSPITALITY LIGHT STRANGER AN WE'LL PUT UP YOUR HORSE MANDY WILL HAVE SUPPER READY BY THE TIME WE FINISH THE JOB

6538-81843-0011 SHE HAD PLACED THE PINE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND DICK NOTICED THAT IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH FOR FIVE OR SIX PERSONS HE PUT HIS SADDLE BAGS AND BLANKETS IN A CORNER AND HE AND THE MAN DREW UP CHAIRS HE HAD SELDOM BEHELD A MORE CHEERFUL SCENE
6538-81843-0012 IN A GREAT FIREPLACE TEN FEET WIDE BIG LOGS ROARED AND CRACKLED CORN CAKES VEGETABLES AND TWO KINDS OF MEAT WERE COOKING OVER THE COALS AND A GREAT POT OF COFFEE BOILED AND BUBBLED NO CANDLES HAD BEEN LIGHTED BUT THEY WERE NOT NEEDED THE FLAMES GAVE SUFFICIENT ILLUMINATION SET YOUNG MAN
6538-81843-0013 I'M GRATEFUL SAID DICK FALLING INTO THE SPIRIT OF IT
6538-81843-0014 I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AS HE LOOKS LIKE A HEALTHY MAN TWOULDN'T DO FOR ME TO BE TOO HEARTY SAID LEFFINGWELL OR I'D KEEP MANDY HERE COOKIN ALL THE TIME THEY SEEMED PLEASANT PEOPLE TO DICK GOOD HONEST MOUNTAIN TYPES AND HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD FOUND THEIR HOUSE
6538-81843-0015 THE ROOM IN WHICH THEY SAT WAS LARGE APPARENTLY USED FOR ALL PURPOSES KITCHEN DINING ROOM SITTING ROOM AND BEDROOM AN OLD FASHIONED SQUIRREL RIFLE LAY ON HOOKS PROJECTING FROM THE WALL BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER SIGN OF A WEAPON
6538-81843-0016 DICK SURMISED THAT THIS BED WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO HIM THEIR APPETITES GREW LAX AND FINALLY CEASED THEN LEFFINGWELL YAWNED AND STRETCHED HIS ARMS STRANGER HE SAID WE RISE EARLY AN GO TO BED EARLY IN THESE PARTS
6538-81843-0017 HE MURMURED HIS EXCUSES AND SAID HE BELIEVED HE WOULD LIKE TO RETIRE DON'T YOU BE BASHFUL ABOUT SAYIN SO EXCLAIMED LEFFINGWELL HEARTILY
6538-81843-0018 THERE WAS A SMALL WINDOW NEAR THE FOOT OF THE ROOM AND WHEN HE NOTICED IT HE RESOLVED TO LET IN A LITTLE AIR LATER ON THE MOUNTAINEERS LIKED HOT ROOMS ALL THE TIME BUT HE DID NOT THIS WINDOW CONTAINED NO GLASS BUT WAS CLOSED WITH A BROAD SHUTTER
6538-81843-0019 THE BOY UNDRESSED AND GOT INTO BED PLACING HIS SADDLE BAGS ON THE FOOT OF IT AND THE PISTOL THAT HE CARRIED IN HIS BELT UNDER HIS HEAD HE FELL ASLEEP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND HAD HE BEEN ASKED BEFOREHAND HE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT NOTHING COULD AWAKE HIM BEFORE MORNING NEVERTHELESS HE AWOKE BEFORE MIDNIGHT
6538-81843-0020 DESPITE THE LANGUOR PRODUCED BY FOOD AND HEAT A CERTAIN NERVOUS APPREHENSION HAD BEEN AT WORK IN THE BOY'S MIND AND IT FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE UNKNOWN REGIONS OF SLEEP HIS BODY WAS DEAD FOR A TIME AND HIS MIND TOO BUT THIS NERVOUS POWER WORKED ON ALMOST INDEPENDENTLY OF HIM
6538-81843-0021 IT HAD NOTED THE SOUND OF VOICES NEARBY AND AWAKENED HIM
6538-81843-0022 HE SAT UP IN HIS BED AND BECAME CONSCIOUS OF A HOT AND ACHING HEAD THEN HE REMEMBERED THE WINDOW AND SOFTLY DRAWING TWO PEGS THAT FASTENED IT IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT NOT AWAKEN HIS GOOD HOSTS HE OPENED IT INWARD A FEW INCHES THE COLD AIR POURED IN AT THE CREVICE AND FELT LIKE HEAVEN ON HIS FACE
6538-81843-0023 GRATEFUL FOR THE FRESH AIR THE SAME MYSTERIOUS POWER GAVE HIM A SECOND WARNING SIGNAL HE HEARD THE HUM OF VOICES AND SAT UP AGAIN IT WAS MERELY THE LEFFINGWELLS IN THE BED AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM TALKING
6538-81843-0024 PERHAPS HE HAD NOT BEEN ASLEEP MORE THAN AN HOUR AND IT WAS NATURAL THAT THEY SHOULD LIE AWAKE A WHILE TALKING ABOUT THE COMING OF THIS YOUNG STRANGER OR ANY OTHER EVENT OF THE DAY THAT INTERESTED THEM THEN HE CAUGHT A TONE OR AN INFLECTION THAT HE DID NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE BEEN USED BY EITHER OF THE LEFFINGWELLS
6538-81843-0025 A THIRD SIGNAL OF ALARM WAS PROMPTLY REGISTERED ON HIS BRAIN HE LEANED FROM THE BED AND PULLING ASIDE THE CURTAIN A HALF AN INCH OR SO LOOKED INTO THE ROOM THE FIRE HAD DIED DOWN EXCEPT A FEW COALS WHICH CAST BUT A FAINT LIGHT
6538-81843-0026 ALL ARMED HEAVILY AND THE RESEMBLANCE OF TWO OF THEM TO THE LEFFINGWELLS WAS SO STRIKING THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT THEY WERE THEIR SONS NOW HE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THOSE EMPTY STALLS THE THIRD MAN WHO HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS SHOULDER TOWARD DICK TURNED HIS FACE PRESENTLY AND THE BOY WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSED AN EXCLAMATION
6538-81843-0027 IT WAS THE ONE WHO HAD REINED HIS HORSE ACROSS THE ROAD TO STOP HIM A FOURTH AND CONCLUSIVE SIGNAL OF ALARM WAS REGISTERED UPON HIS BRAIN HE BEGAN TO DRESS RAPIDLY AND WITHOUT NOISE MEANWHILE HE LISTENED INTENTLY AND COULD HEAR THE WORDS THEY SPOKE
6538-81843-0028 THE WOMAN WAS PLEADING WITH THEM TO LET HIM GO HE WAS ONLY A HARMLESS LAD AND WHILE THESE WERE DARK DAYS A CRIME COMMITTED NOW MIGHT YET BE PUNISHED A HARMLESS BOY SAID THE STRANGE MAN HE'S QUICK AN STRONG ENOUGH I TELL YOU
6538-81843-0029 S'POSE WE JEST TAKE THE HOSS AND SEND THE BOY ON A HOSS LIKE THAT WOULD BE KNOWED PROTESTED THE WOMAN WHAT IF SOJERS COME LOOKIN FUR HIM WE COULD RUN HIM OFF IN THE HILLS AN KEEP HIM THERE A WHILE SAID LEFFINGWELL I KNOW PLACES WHERE SOJERS WOULDN'T FIND THAT HOSS IN A THOUSAND YEARS
6538-81843-0030 NOW WE KNOW THAT THIS BOY RODE STRAIGHT FROM THE TENT OF GENERAL THOMAS HISSELF HE'S A UNION SOJER AN YOUNG AS HE IS HE'S AN OFFICER HE WOULDN'T BE SENT OUT BY GENERAL THOMAS HISSELF LESS IT WAS ON BIG BUSINESS HE'S GOT MESSAGES DISPATCHES OF SOME KIND THAT ARE WORTH A HEAP TO SOMEBODY
6538-81843-0031 NOW WE'VE GOT TO GET EM AN GET THE FULL WORTH OF EM FROM THEM TO WHOM THEY'RE WORTH THE MOST HE'S GOT A PISTOL SAID THE ELDER LEFFINGWELL
6538-81843-0032 THE MAN KERINS LAUGHED HE'LL NEVER GET A CHANCE TO SHOOT HE SAID WHY AFTER ALL HE WENT THROUGH TODAY HE'LL SLEEP LIKE A LOG TILL MORNIN THAT'S SO SAID ONE OF THE YOUNG LEFFINGWELLS AN KERINS IS RIGHT WE OUGHT TO GRAB THEM DISPATCHES
6538-81843-0033 SHUT UP JIM YOU FOOL SAID HIS MOTHER SHARPLY DO YOU WANT MURDER ON YOUR HANDS STEALIN HOSSES IS BAD ENOUGH BUT IF THAT BOY HAS GOT THE BIG DISPATCHES YOU SAY HE HAS AN HE'S MISSIN DON'T YOU THINK THAT SOJERS WILL COME AFTER HIM
6538-81843-0034 WHO PROTESTED AGAIN THAT IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TAKE THE HORSE AS FOR THE DISPATCHES IT WASN'T WISE FOR THEM TO FOOL WITH SUCH THINGS BUT KERINS INSISTED ON GOING THE WHOLE ROUTE AND THE YOUNG LEFFINGWELLS WERE WITH HIM
6538-81843-0035 BUT HIS FEAR WAS GREATEST LEST HE MIGHT LOSE THE PRECIOUS DISPATCHES THAT HE BORE FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO HE MIGHT TAKE HIS PISTOLS AND FIGHT BUT HE COULD NOT FIGHT THEM ALL WITH SUCCESS THEN THAT PLEASANT FLOOD OF COLD AIR GAVE HIM THE KEY
