542-125348-0001 DOROTHY SAT UP AND NOTICED THAT THE HOUSE WAS NOT MOVING NOR WAS IT DARK FOR THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE CAME IN AT THE WINDOW FLOODING THE LITTLE ROOM SHE SPRANG FROM HER BED AND WITH TOTO AT HER HEELS RAN AND OPENED THE DOOR
542-125348-0002 THE LITTLE GIRL GAVE A CRY OF AMAZEMENT AND LOOKED ABOUT HER HER EYES GROWING BIGGER AND BIGGER AT THE WONDERFUL SIGHTS SHE SAW
542-125348-0003 THERE WERE LOVELY PATCHES OF GREENSWARD ALL ABOUT WITH STATELY TREES BEARING RICH AND LUSCIOUS FRUITS BANKS OF GORGEOUS FLOWERS WERE ON EVERY HAND AND BIRDS WITH RARE AND BRILLIANT PLUMAGE SANG AND FLUTTERED IN THE TREES AND BUSHES
542-125348-0004 A LITTLE WAY OFF WAS A SMALL BROOK RUSHING AND SPARKLING ALONG BETWEEN GREEN BANKS AND MURMURING IN A VOICE VERY GRATEFUL TO A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD LIVED SO LONG ON THE DRY GRAY PRAIRIES
542-125348-0005 WHILE SHE STOOD LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS SHE NOTICED COMING TOWARD HER A GROUP OF THE QUEEREST PEOPLE SHE HAD EVER SEEN THEY WERE NOT AS BIG AS THE GROWN FOLK SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN USED TO BUT NEITHER WERE THEY VERY SMALL IN FACT
542-125348-0006 THEY SEEMED ABOUT AS TALL AS DOROTHY WHO WAS A WELL GROWN CHILD FOR HER AGE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SO FAR AS LOOKS GO MANY YEARS OLDER THREE WERE MEN AND ONE A WOMAN AND ALL WERE ODDLY DRESSED
