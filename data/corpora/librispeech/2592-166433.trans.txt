2592-166433-0000 FREE BUT A MONSTER THE PECULIAR ABILITY OF THE HUMAN MIND TO SLIP SO READILY INTO THE REFUGE OF THE COMMONPLACE AFTER OR EVEN DURING SOME WELL NIGH INTOLERABLE CRISIS
2592-166433-0001 HAS BEEN TO ME LONG ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING PHENOMENA OF OUR PSYCHOLOGY IT IS INSTINCTIVELY A PROTECTIVE HABIT OF COURSE
2592-166433-0002 THE STRIPES SAY OF THE ZEBRA AND TIGER THAT BLEND SO CUNNINGLY WITH THE BARRED AND SPECKLED SHADOWINGS OF BUSH AND JUNGLE THE TWIG AND LEAFLIKE SHAPES AND HUES OF CERTAIN INSECTS IN FACT
2592-166433-0003 ALL THAT NATURAL CAMOUFLAGE WHICH WAS THE BASIS OF THE ART OF CONCEALMENT SO ASTONISHINGLY DEVELOPED IN THE LATE WAR LIKE THE ANIMALS OF THE WILD THE MIND OF MAN MOVES THROUGH A JUNGLE THE JUNGLE OF LIFE
2592-166433-0004 PASSING ALONG PATHS BEATEN OUT BY THE THOUGHT OF HIS COUNTLESS FOREFATHERS IN THEIR PROGRESS FROM BIRTH TO DEATH AND THESE PATHS ARE BORDERED AND SCREENED FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY WITH BUSH AND TREES OF HIS OWN SELECTION SETTING OUT AND CULTIVATION
2592-166433-0005 SHELTERS OF THE FAMILIAR THE HABITUAL THE CUSTOMARY ON THESE ANCESTRAL PATHS WITHIN THESE BARRIERS OF USAGE MAN MOVES HIDDEN AND SECURE AS THE ANIMALS IN THEIR HAUNTS OR SO HE THINKS OUTSIDE THEM LIE THE WILDERNESSES AND THE GARDENS OF THE UNKNOWN
2592-166433-0006 BUT THEY ARE HOME TO HIM THEREFORE IT IS THAT HE SCURRIES FROM SOME OPEN PLACE OF REVELATION SOME STORM OF EMOTION SOME STRENGTH TESTING STRUGGLE BACK INTO THE SHELTER OF THE OBVIOUS
2592-166433-0007 FINDING IT AN INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT THAT DEMANDS NO SLIGHTEST EXPENDITURE OF MENTAL ENERGY OR INITIATIVE STRENGTH TO SALLY FORTH AGAIN INTO THE UNFAMILIAR I CRAVE PARDON FOR THIS DIGRESSION I SET IT DOWN BECAUSE NOW I REMEMBER HOW
2592-166433-0008 WHEN DRAKE AT LAST BROKE THE SILENCE THAT HAD CLOSED IN UPON THE PASSING OF THAT STILL SMALL VOICE THE ESSENCE OF THESE THOUGHTS OCCURRED TO ME HE STRODE OVER TO THE WEEPING GIRL AND IN HIS VOICE WAS A ROUGHNESS THAT ANGERED ME UNTIL I REALIZED HIS PURPOSE
2592-166433-0009 GET UP RUTH HE ORDERED HE CAME BACK ONCE AND HE'LL COME BACK AGAIN NOW LET HIM BE AND HELP US GET A MEAL TOGETHER I'M HUNGRY
2592-166433-0010 EAT SHE EXCLAIMED YOU CAN BE HUNGRY YOU BET I CAN AND I AM HE ANSWERED CHEERFULLY COME ON WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT RUTH I BROKE IN GENTLY WE'LL ALL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT OURSELVES A LITTLE IF WE'RE TO BE OF ANY USE TO HIM
2592-166433-0011 YOU MUST EAT AND THEN REST NO USE CRYING IN THE MILK EVEN IF IT'S SPILT OBSERVED DRAKE EVEN MORE CHEERFULLY BRUTAL I LEARNED THAT AT THE FRONT WHERE WE GOT SO WE'D YELP FOR FOOD EVEN WHEN THE LADS WHO'D BEEN BRINGING IT WERE ALL MIXED UP IN IT
2592-166433-0012 SHE LIFTED VENTNOR'S HEAD FROM HER LAP RESTED IT ON THE SILKS AROSE EYES WRATHFUL HER LITTLE HANDS CLOSED IN FISTS AS THOUGH TO STRIKE HIM OH YOU BRUTE SHE WHISPERED
2592-166433-0013 THAT'S BETTER SAID DICK GO AHEAD AND HIT ME IF YOU WANT THE MADDER YOU GET THE BETTER YOU'LL FEEL FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD THEN HER ANGER FLED THANKS DICK SHE SAID QUIETLY
2592-166433-0014 BREWED TEA OVER THE SPIRIT LAMP WITH WATER FROM THE BUBBLING SPRING IN THESE COMMONPLACES I KNEW THAT SHE AT LEAST WAS FINDING RELIEF FROM THAT STRAIN OF THE ABNORMAL UNDER WHICH WE HAD LABORED SO LONG
2592-166433-0015 TO MY SURPRISE I FOUND THAT I WAS HUNGRY AND WITH DEEP RELIEF I WATCHED RUTH PARTAKE OF FOOD AND DRINK EVEN THOUGH LIGHTLY ABOUT HER SEEMED TO HOVER SOMETHING OF THE ETHEREAL ELUSIVE AND DISQUIETING WAS IT THE STRANGELY PELLUCID LIGHT THAT GAVE THE EFFECT I WONDERED
2592-166433-0016 AND KNEW IT WAS NOT FOR AS I SCANNED HER COVERTLY THERE FELL UPON HER FACE THAT SHADOW OF INHUMAN TRANQUILLITY OF UNEARTHLY WITHDRAWAL WHICH I GUESSED HAD MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE MADDENED VENTNOR INTO HIS ATTACK UPON THE DISK I WATCHED HER FIGHT AGAINST IT
2592-166433-0017 DRIVE IT BACK WHITE LIPPED SHE RAISED HER HEAD AND MET MY GAZE
2592-166433-0018 SHAME IT CAME TO ME THAT PAINFUL AS IT MIGHT BE FOR HER THE TIME FOR QUESTIONING HAD COME RUTH I SAID I KNOW IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO REMIND YOU THAT WE'RE IN A TIGHT PLACE EVERY FACT AND EVERY SCRAP OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WE CAN LAY HOLD OF
2592-166433-0019 IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN ENABLING US TO DETERMINE OUR COURSE I'M GOING TO REPEAT YOUR BROTHER'S QUESTION WHAT DID NORHALA DO TO YOU AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE FLOATING BEFORE THE DISK
2592-166433-0020 THE BLAZE OF INTEREST IN DRAKE'S EYES AT THESE QUESTIONS CHANGED TO AMAZEMENT AT HER STRICKEN RECOIL FROM THEM THERE WAS NOTHING SHE WHISPERED THEN DEFIANTLY NOTHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN RUTH
2592-166433-0021 I SPOKE SHARPLY NOW IN MY OWN PERPLEXITY YOU DO KNOW YOU MUST TELL US FOR HIS SAKE I POINTED TOWARD VENTNOR SHE DREW A LONG BREATH YOU'RE RIGHT OF COURSE SHE SAID UNSTEADILY ONLY I
2592-166433-0022 I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD FIGHT IT OUT MYSELF BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO KNOW IT THERE'S A TAINT UPON ME I CAUGHT IN DRAKE'S SWIFT GLANCE THE ECHO OF MY OWN THRILL OF APPREHENSION FOR HER SANITY YES SHE SAID NOW QUIETLY
2592-166433-0023 SOME NEW AND ALIEN THING WITHIN MY HEART MY BRAIN MY SOUL IT CAME TO ME FROM NORHALA WHEN WE RODE THE FLYING BLOCK AND HE SEALED UPON ME WHEN I WAS IN HIS AGAIN SHE CRIMSONED EMBRACE
2592-166433-0024 AND AS WE GAZED AT HER INCREDULOUSLY A THING THAT URGES ME TO FORGET YOU TWO AND MARTIN AND ALL THE WORLD I'VE KNOWN THAT TRIES TO PULL ME FROM YOU FROM ALL TO DRIFT UNTROUBLED IN SOME VAST CALM FILLED WITH AN ORDERED ECSTASY OF PEACE
2592-166433-0025 AND WHOSE CALLING I WANT GOD HELP ME OH SO DESPERATELY TO HEED IT WHISPERED TO ME FIRST SHE SAID FROM NORHALA WHEN SHE PUT HER ARM AROUND ME IT WHISPERED AND THEN SEEMED TO FLOAT FROM HER AND COVER ME LIKE LIKE A VEIL
2592-166433-0026 AND FROM HEAD TO FOOT IT WAS A QUIETNESS AND PEACE THAT HELD WITHIN IT A HAPPINESS AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME UTTERLY TRANQUIL AND UTTERLY FREE I SEEMED TO BE AT THE DOORWAY TO UNKNOWN ECSTASIES AND THE LIFE I HAD KNOWN ONLY A DREAM
2592-166433-0027 AND YOU ALL OF YOU EVEN MARTIN DREAMS WITHIN A DREAM YOU WEREN'T REAL AND YOU DID NOT MATTER HYPNOTISM MUTTERED DRAKE AS SHE PAUSED NO SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NO MORE THAN THAT
2592-166433-0028 THE WONDER OF IT GREW AND GREW I THRILLED WITH IT I REMEMBER NOTHING OF THAT RIDE SAW NOTHING EXCEPT THAT ONCE THROUGH THE PEACE ENFOLDING ME PIERCED WARNING THAT MARTIN WAS IN PERIL AND I BROKE THROUGH TO SEE HIM CLUTCHING NORHALA AND TO SEE FLOATING UP IN HER EYES DEATH FOR HIM
2592-166433-0029 AND I SAVED HIM AND AGAIN FORGOT THEN WHEN I SAW THAT BEAUTIFUL FLAMING SHAPE I FELT NO TERROR NO FEAR ONLY A TREMENDOUS JOYOUS ANTICIPATION AS THOUGH AS THOUGH SHE FALTERED HUNG HER HEAD
2592-166433-0030 THEN LEAVING THAT SENTENCE UNFINISHED WHISPERED AND WHEN IT LIFTED ME IT WAS AS THOUGH I HAD COME AT LAST OUT OF SOME ENDLESS BLACK OCEAN OF DESPAIR INTO THE FULL SUN OF PARADISE RUTH CRIED DRAKE
2592-166433-0031 AND AT THE PAIN IN HIS CRY SHE WINCED WAIT SHE SAID AND HELD UP A LITTLE TREMULOUS HAND YOU ASKED AND NOW YOU MUST LISTEN SHE WAS SILENT AND WHEN ONCE MORE SHE SPOKE HER VOICE WAS LOW CURIOUSLY RHYTHMIC HER EYES RAPT
2592-166433-0032 I WAS FREE FREE FROM EVERY HUMAN FETTER OF FEAR OR SORROW OR LOVE OR HATE FREE EVEN OF HOPE FOR WHAT WAS THERE TO HOPE FOR WHEN EVERYTHING DESIRABLE WAS MINE
2592-166433-0033 AND I WAS ELEMENTAL ONE WITH THE ETERNAL THINGS YET FULLY CONSCIOUS THAT I WAS I IT WAS AS THOUGH I WERE THE SHINING SHADOW OF A STAR AFLOAT UPON THE BREAST OF SOME STILL AND HIDDEN WOODLAND POOL
2592-166433-0034 AS THOUGH I WERE A LITTLE WIND DANCING AMONG THE MOUNTAIN TOPS A MIST WHIRLING DOWN A QUIET GLEN A SHIMMERING LANCE OF THE AURORA PULSING IN THE HIGH SOLITUDES AND THERE WAS MUSIC STRANGE AND WONDROUS MUSIC AND TERRIBLE
2592-166433-0035 BUT NOT TERRIBLE TO ME WHO WAS PART OF IT VAST CHORDS AND SINGING THEMES THAT RANG LIKE CLUSTERS OF LITTLE SWINGING STARS AND HARMONIES THAT WERE LIKE THE VERY VOICE OF INFINITE LAW RESOLVING WITHIN ITSELF ALL DISCORDS AND ALL
2592-166433-0036 ALL PASSIONLESS YET RAPTUROUS OUT OF THE THING THAT HELD ME OUT FROM ITS FIRES PULSED VITALITY A FLOOD OF INHUMAN ENERGY IN WHICH I WAS BATHED AND IT WAS AS THOUGH THIS ENERGY WERE
2592-166433-0037 REASSEMBLING ME FITTING ME EVEN CLOSER TO THE ELEMENTAL THINGS CHANGING ME FULLY INTO THEM I FELT THE LITTLE TENDRILS TOUCHING CARESSING THEN CAME THE SHOTS AWAKENING WAS DREADFUL A STRUGGLING BACK FROM DROWNING
2592-166433-0038 I SAW MARTIN BLASTED I DROVE THE THE SPELL AWAY FROM ME TORE IT AWAY AND O WALTER DICK IT HURT IT HURT AND FOR A BREATH BEFORE I RAN TO HIM IT WAS LIKE
2592-166433-0039 LIKE COMING FROM A WORLD IN WHICH THERE WAS NO DISORDER NO SORROW NO DOUBTS A RHYTHMIC HARMONIOUS WORLD OF LIGHT AND MUSIC INTO INTO A WORLD THAT WAS LIKE A BLACK AND DIRTY KITCHEN AND IT'S THERE HER VOICE ROSE HYSTERICALLY
2592-166433-0040 IT'S STILL WITHIN ME WHISPERING WHISPERING URGING ME AWAY FROM YOU FROM MARTIN FROM EVERY HUMAN THING BIDDING ME GIVE MYSELF UP SURRENDER MY HUMANITY ITS SEAL SHE SOBBED
2592-166433-0041 AN ALIEN CONSCIOUSNESS SEALED WITHIN ME THAT TRIES TO MAKE THE HUMAN ME A SLAVE THAT WAITS TO OVERCOME MY WILL AND IF I SURRENDER GIVES ME FREEDOM AN INCREDIBLE FREEDOM BUT MAKES ME BEING STILL HUMAN A MONSTER
2592-166433-0042 SHE HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS QUIVERING IF I COULD SLEEP SHE WAILED BUT I'M AFRAID TO SLEEP I THINK I SHALL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN FOR SLEEPING HOW DO I KNOW WHAT I MAY BE WHEN I WAKE I CAUGHT DRAKE'S EYE HE NODDED
2592-166433-0043 I SLIPPED MY HAND DOWN INTO THE MEDICINE CASE BROUGHT FORTH A CERTAIN POTENT AND TASTELESS COMBINATION OF DRUGS WHICH I CARRY UPON EXPLORATIONS I DROPPED A LITTLE INTO HER CUP THEN HELD IT TO HER LIPS LIKE A CHILD UNTHINKING SHE OBEYED AND DRANK
2592-166433-0044 BUT I'LL NOT SURRENDER HER EYES WERE TRAGIC NEVER THINK IT I CAN WIN DON'T YOU KNOW I CAN WIN DRAKE DROPPED DOWN BESIDE HER DREW HER TOWARD HIM
2592-166433-0045 AND REMEMBER THIS NINE TENTHS OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING NOW IS PURELY OVER WROUGHT NERVES AND WEARINESS YOU'LL WIN AND WE'LL WIN NEVER DOUBT IT I DON'T SHE SAID I KNOW IT OH IT WILL BE HARD BUT I WILL
