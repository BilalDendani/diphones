3537-5704-0000 AS INDICATED IN THE LAST CHAPTER THE CANON OF REPUTABILITY TO SOME EXTENT SHAPES OUR TASTES
3537-5704-0001 SO THAT UNDER ITS GUIDANCE ANYTHING WILL BE ACCEPTED AS BECOMING UNTIL ITS NOVELTY WEARS OFF OR UNTIL THE WARRANT OF REPUTABILITY IS TRANSFERRED TO A NEW AND NOVEL STRUCTURE SERVING THE SAME GENERAL PURPOSE
3537-5704-0002 WHEN SEEN IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF HALF A DOZEN YEARS OR MORE THE BEST OF OUR FASHIONS STRIKE US AS GROTESQUE IF NOT UNSIGHTLY OUR TRANSIENT ATTACHMENT TO WHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE THE LATEST RESTS ON OTHER THAN AESTHETIC GROUNDS
3537-5704-0003 AND LASTS ONLY UNTIL OUR ABIDING AESTHETIC SENSE HAS HAD TIME TO ASSERT ITSELF AND REJECT THIS LATEST INDIGESTIBLE CONTRIVANCE THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING AN AESTHETIC NAUSEA TAKES MORE OR LESS TIME
3537-5704-0004 AFFORDS GROUND FOR THE INFERENCE THAT THE MORE RAPIDLY THE STYLES SUCCEED AND DISPLACE ONE ANOTHER THE MORE OFFENSIVE THEY ARE TO SOUND TASTE THE PRESUMPTION THEREFORE IS THAT THE FARTHER THE COMMUNITY
3537-5704-0005 ESPECIALLY THE WEALTHY CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY DEVELOP IN WEALTH AND MOBILITY AND IN THE RANGE OF THEIR HUMAN CONTACT THE MORE IMPERATIVELY WILL THE LAW OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE ASSERT ITSELF IN MATTERS OF DRESS
3537-5704-0006 WILL BE THE VARYING STYLES THAT SUCCESSIVELY COME INTO VOGUE THERE REMAINS AT LEAST ONE POINT IN THIS THEORY OF DRESS YET TO BE DISCUSSED MOST OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID APPLIES TO MEN'S ATTIRE AS WELL AS TO THAT OF WOMEN
3537-5704-0007 AS HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE DISCUSSION OF WOMAN'S STATUS UNDER THE HEADS OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION IT HAS IN THE COURSE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BECOME THE OFFICE OF THE WOMAN TO CONSUME VICARIOUSLY FOR THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD
3537-5704-0008 TO IMPRESS UPON THE BEHOLDER THE FACT OFTEN INDEED A FICTION THAT THE WEARER DOES NOT AND CAN NOT HABITUALLY ENGAGE IN USEFUL WORK PROPRIETY REQUIRES RESPECTABLE WOMEN TO ABSTAIN MORE CONSISTENTLY FROM USEFUL EFFORT AND TO MAKE
3537-5704-0009 AND OF WHICH SHE SHOULD BE THE CHIEF ORNAMENT
3537-5704-0010 THIS FEATURE TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER FACT THAT PROPRIETY REQUIRES MORE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EXPENSIVE DISPLAY IN THE DRESS AND OTHER PARAPHERNALIA OF WOMEN GOES TO ENFORCE THE VIEW ALREADY IMPLIED IN WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
3537-5704-0011 BY VIRTUE OF ITS DESCENT FROM A PATRIARCHAL PAST OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM MAKES IT THE WOMAN'S FUNCTION IN AN ESPECIAL DEGREE TO PUT IN EVIDENCE HER HOUSEHOLD'S ABILITY TO PAY ACCORDING TO THE MODERN CIVILIZED SCHEME OF LIFE
3537-5704-0012 THE GOOD NAME OF THE HOUSEHOLD TO WHICH SHE BELONGS SHOULD BE THE SPECIAL CARE OF THE WOMAN
3537-5704-0013 IS THEREFORE THE WOMAN'S SPHERE IN THE IDEAL SCHEME AS IT TENDS TO REALIZE ITSELF IN THE LIFE OF THE HIGHER PECUNIARY CLASSES THIS ATTENTION TO CONSPICUOUS WASTE OF SUBSTANCE AND EFFORT
3537-5704-0014 CAME TO BE PART OF THE SERVICES REQUIRED OF THEM THE WOMEN BEING NOT THEIR OWN MASTERS OBVIOUS EXPENDITURE AND LEISURE ON THEIR PART WOULD REDOUND TO THE CREDIT OF THEIR MASTER RATHER THAN TO THEIR OWN CREDIT AND THEREFORE
3537-5704-0015 THE MORE EXPENSIVE AND THE MORE OBVIOUSLY UNPRODUCTIVE THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ARE THE MORE CREDITABLE AND MORE EFFECTIVE FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPUTABILITY OF THE HOUSEHOLD OR ITS HEAD WILL THEIR LIFE BE
3537-5704-0016 AND FOR SUFFICIENT REASON CONSPICUOUS WASTE AND CONSPICUOUS LEISURE ARE REPUTABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH PECUNIARY STRENGTH IS REPUTABLE OR HONORIFIC BECAUSE IN THE LAST ANALYSIS
3537-5704-0017 SO THEN WHEREVER WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE AND THE SHOW OF ABSTENTION FROM EFFORT IS NORMALLY OR ON AN AVERAGE CARRIED TO THE EXTENT OF SHOWING OBVIOUS DISCOMFORT OR VOLUNTARILY INDUCED PHYSICAL DISABILITY
3537-5704-0018 THERE THE IMMEDIATE INFERENCE IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION DOES NOT PERFORM THIS WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE AND UNDERGO THIS DISABILITY FOR HER OWN PERSONAL GAIN IN PECUNIARY REPUTE
3537-5704-0019 TO APPLY THIS GENERALIZATION TO WOMEN'S DRESS AND PUT THE MATTER IN CONCRETE TERMS THE HIGH HEEL THE SKIRT THE IMPRACTICABLE BONNET THE CORSET AND THE GENERAL DISREGARD
3537-5704-0020 OF THE WEARER'S COMFORT WHICH IS AN OBVIOUS FEATURE OF ALL CIVILIZED WOMEN'S APPAREL ARE SO MANY ITEMS OF EVIDENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT IN THE MODERN CIVILIZED SCHEME OF LIFE THE WOMAN IS STILL IN THEORY THE ECONOMIC DEPENDENT OF THE MAN
3537-5704-0021 THE HOMELY REASON FOR ALL THIS CONSPICUOUS LEISURE AND ATTIRE ON THE PART OF WOMEN LIES IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SERVANTS TO WHOM IN THE DIFFERENTIATION OF ECONOMIC FUNCTIONS
3537-5704-0022 ACCORDING TO THE IDEAL SCHEME OF THE PECUNIARY CULTURE THE LADY OF THE HOUSE IS THE CHIEF MENIAL OF THE HOUSEHOLD BESIDES SERVANTS CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED AS SUCH THERE IS AT LEAST ONE OTHER CLASS OF PERSONS WHOSE GARB
3537-5704-0023 ASSIMILATES THEM TO THE CLASS OF SERVANTS AND SHOWS MANY OF THE FEATURES THAT GO TO MAKE UP THE WOMANLINESS OF WOMAN'S DRESS THIS IS THE PRIESTLY CLASS PRIESTLY VESTMENTS SHOW IN ACCENTUATED FORM
3537-5704-0024 ALL THE FEATURES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EVIDENCE OF A SERVILE STATUS AND A VICARIOUS LIFE EVEN MORE STRIKINGLY THAN THE EVERYDAY HABIT OF THE PRIEST THE VESTMENTS PROPERLY SO CALLED ARE ORNATE
3537-5704-0025 GROTESQUE INCONVENIENT AND AT LEAST OSTENSIBLY COMFORTLESS TO THE POINT OF DISTRESS THE PRIEST IS AT THE SAME TIME EXPECTED TO REFRAIN FROM USEFUL EFFORT AND WHEN BEFORE THE PUBLIC EYE
3537-5704-0026 TO PRESENT AN IMPASSIVELY DISCONSOLATE COUNTENANCE VERY MUCH AFTER THE MANNER OF A WELL TRAINED DOMESTIC SERVANT THE SHAVEN FACE OF THE PRIEST IS A FURTHER ITEM TO THE SAME EFFECT
3537-5704-0027 THIS ASSIMILATION OF THE PRIESTLY CLASS TO THE CLASS OF BODY SERVANTS IN DEMEANOR AND APPAREL IS DUE TO THE SIMILARITY OF THE TWO CLASSES AS REGARDS ECONOMIC FUNCTION IN ECONOMIC THEORY THE PRIEST IS A BODY SERVANT
3537-5704-0028 CONSTRUCTIVELY IN ATTENDANCE UPON THE PERSON OF THE DIVINITY WHOSE LIVERY HE WEARS HIS LIVERY IS OF A VERY EXPENSIVE CHARACTER AS IT SHOULD BE IN ORDER TO SET FORTH IN A BESEEMING MANNER THE DIGNITY OF HIS EXALTED MASTER
3537-5704-0029 BUT IT IS CONTRIVED TO SHOW THAT THE WEARING OF IT CONTRIBUTES LITTLE OR NOTHING TO THE PHYSICAL COMFORT OF THE WEARER FOR IT IS AN ITEM OF VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION
3537-5704-0030 AND THE REPUTE WHICH ACCRUES FROM ITS CONSUMPTION IS TO BE IMPUTED TO THE ABSENT MASTER NOT TO THE SERVANT THE LINE OF DEMARCATION BETWEEN THE DRESS OF WOMEN PRIESTS AND SERVANTS ON THE ONE HAND AND OF MEN ON THE OTHER HAND
3537-5704-0031 IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY OBSERVED IN PRACTICE BUT IT WILL SCARCELY BE DISPUTED THAT IT IS ALWAYS PRESENT IN A MORE OR LESS DEFINITE WAY IN THE POPULAR HABITS OF THOUGHT
3537-5704-0032 TO THE EXTENT OF ARRAYING THEMSELVES IN APPAREL THAT IS OBVIOUSLY DESIGNED TO VEX THE MORTAL FRAME BUT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES WITHOUT HESITATION THAT SUCH APPAREL FOR MEN IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE NORMAL
3537-5704-0033 AND ONE SOMETIMES HEARS THE REMARK THAT SUCH OR SUCH AN EXQUISITELY ATTIRED GENTLEMAN IS AS WELL DRESSED AS A FOOTMAN CERTAIN APPARENT DISCREPANCIES UNDER THIS THEORY OF DRESS MERIT A MORE DETAILED EXAMINATION
3537-5704-0034 ESPECIALLY AS THEY MARK A MORE OR LESS EVIDENT TREND IN THE LATER AND MATURER DEVELOPMENT OF DRESS THE VOGUE OF THE CORSET OFFERS AN APPARENT EXCEPTION FROM THE RULE OF WHICH IT HAS HERE BEEN CITED AS AN ILLUSTRATION
3537-5704-0035 A CLOSER EXAMINATION HOWEVER WILL SHOW THAT THIS APPARENT EXCEPTION IS REALLY A VERIFICATION OF THE RULE THAT THE VOGUE OF ANY GIVEN ELEMENT OR FEATURE IN DRESS RESTS ON ITS UTILITY AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STANDING
3537-5704-0036 THE HOLIDAY USE OF THE CONTRIVANCE IS DUE TO IMITATION OF A HIGHER CLASS CANON OF DECENCY UPWARDS FROM THIS LOW LEVEL OF INDIGENCE AND MANUAL LABOR THE CORSET WAS UNTIL WITHIN A GENERATION OR TWO
3537-5704-0037 NEARLY INDISPENSABLE TO A SOCIALLY BLAMELESS STANDING FOR ALL WOMEN INCLUDING THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST REPUTABLE THIS RULE HELD SO LONG AS THERE STILL WAS NO LARGE CLASS OF PEOPLE WEALTHY ENOUGH TO BE ABOVE THE IMPUTATION
3537-5704-0038 OF ANY NECESSITY FOR MANUAL LABOR AND AT THE SAME TIME LARGE ENOUGH TO FORM A SELF SUFFICIENT ISOLATED SOCIAL BODY
3537-5704-0039 ENFORCED BY THE CURRENT OPINION OF THE CLASS ALONE BUT NOW THERE HAS GROWN UP A LARGE ENOUGH LEISURE CLASS POSSESSED OF SUCH WEALTH THAT ANY ASPERSION ON THE SCORE OF ENFORCED MANUAL EMPLOYMENT WOULD BE IDLE AND HARMLESS CALUMNY
3537-5704-0040 AND THE CORSET HAS THEREFORE IN LARGE MEASURE FALLEN INTO DISUSE WITHIN THIS CLASS THE EXCEPTIONS UNDER THIS RULE OF EXEMPTION FROM THE CORSET ARE MORE APPARENT THAN REAL
3537-5704-0041 THEY ARE THE WEALTHY CLASSES OF COUNTRIES WITH A LOWER INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE
3537-5704-0042 WHICH HAVE RECENTLY AND RAPIDLY RISEN INTO OPULENCE IF THE WORD BE USED AS A TECHNICAL TERM WITHOUT ANY ODIOUS IMPLICATION IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE CORSET PERSISTS IN GREAT MEASURE THROUGH THE PERIOD OF SNOBBERY
3537-5704-0043 WHEREVER AND SO LONG AS IT SERVES ITS PURPOSE AS AN EVIDENCE OF HONORIFIC LEISURE BY ARGUING PHYSICAL DISABILITY IN THE WEARER THE SAME RULE OF COURSE APPLIES TO OTHER MUTILATIONS AND CONTRIVANCES
3537-5704-0044 FOR DECREASING THE VISIBLE EFFICIENCY OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOMETHING SIMILAR SHOULD HOLD TRUE WITH RESPECT TO DIVERS ITEMS OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AND INDEED SOMETHING OF THE KIND DOES SEEM TO HOLD TO A SLIGHT DEGREE OF SUNDRY FEATURES OF DRESS
3537-5704-0045 ESPECIALLY IF SUCH FEATURES INVOLVE A MARKED DISCOMFORT OR APPEARANCE OF DISCOMFORT TO THE WEARER DURING THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS THERE IS A TENDENCY PERCEPTIBLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEN'S DRESS ESPECIALLY
3537-5704-0046 TO DISCONTINUE METHODS OF EXPENDITURE AND THE USE OF SYMBOLS OF LEISURE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN IRKSOME WHICH MAY HAVE SERVED A GOOD PURPOSE IN THEIR TIME BUT THE CONTINUATION OF WHICH AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES TODAY WOULD BE A WORK OF SUPEREROGATION
3537-5704-0047 AS FOR INSTANCE THE USE OF POWDERED WIGS AND OF GOLD LACE AND THE PRACTICE OF CONSTANTLY SHAVING THE FACE THERE HAS OF LATE YEARS BEEN SOME SLIGHT RECRUDESCENCE OF THE SHAVEN FACE IN POLITE SOCIETY
3537-5704-0048 AND IT MAY FAIRLY BE EXPECTED TO GO THE WAY OF THE POWDERED WIG OF OUR GRANDFATHERS THESE INDICES AND OTHERS WHICH RESEMBLE THEM IN POINT OF THE BOLDNESS WITH WHICH THEY POINT OUT TO ALL OBSERVERS THE HABITUAL USELESSNESS OF THOSE PERSONS WHO EMPLOY THEM
3537-5704-0049 THE METHOD OF ADVERTISEMENT UNDERGOES A REFINEMENT WHEN A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE WEALTHY CLASS HAS DEVELOPED WHO HAVE THE LEISURE FOR ACQUIRING SKILL IN INTERPRETING THE SUBTLER SIGNS OF EXPENDITURE LOUD DRESS BECOMES OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE OF TASTE
3537-5704-0050 AS EVINCING AN UNDUE DESIRE TO REACH AND IMPRESS THE UNTRAINED SENSIBILITIES OF THE VULGAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL OF HIGH BREEDING IT IS ONLY THE MORE HONORIFIC ESTEEM ACCORDED BY THE CULTIVATED SENSE OF THE MEMBERS OF HIS OWN HIGH CLASS
3537-5704-0051 THAT IS OF MATERIAL CONSEQUENCE SINCE THE WEALTHY LEISURE CLASS HAS GROWN SO LARGE OR THE CONTACT OF THE LEISURE CLASS INDIVIDUAL WITH MEMBERS OF HIS OWN CLASS HAS GROWN SO WIDE
3537-5704-0052 THE RESULT OF ALL THIS IS A REFINEMENT OF METHODS A RESORT TO SUBTLER CONTRIVANCES AND A SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE SCHEME OF SYMBOLISM IN DRESS
3537-5704-0053 THE ABILITY TO PAY IS PUT IN EVIDENCE BY MEANS WHICH REQUIRE A PROGRESSIVELY NICER DISCRIMINATION IN THE BEHOLDER
