6269-66184-0000 I KNEW THEN WHAT HAD HAPPENED AS WELL AS I KNOW IT NOW BUT WHICH WAS IT FATHER OR MOTHER I DO NOT LIKE TO LOOK BACK TO THE AGONY AND SUSPENSE OF THAT MOMENT MY FATHER HAD DIED AT NEW ORLEANS DURING ONE OF HIS WEEKLY VISITS TO THE CITY
6269-66184-0001 THE LETTER BEARING THESE TIDINGS HAD REACHED RIVERMOUTH THE EVENING OF MY FLIGHT HAD PASSED ME ON THE ROAD BY THE DOWN TRAIN I MUST TURN BACK FOR A MOMENT TO THAT EVENTFUL EVENING
6269-66184-0002 WHEN I FAILED TO MAKE MY APPEARANCE AT SUPPER THE CAPTAIN BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT I HAD REALLY STARTED ON MY WILD TOUR SOUTHWARD A CONJECTURE WHICH SAILOR BEN'S ABSENCE HELPED TO CONFIRM I HAD EVIDENTLY GOT OFF BY THE TRAIN
6269-66184-0003 AND SAILOR BEN HAD FOLLOWED ME THERE WAS NO TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BOSTON AND RIVERMOUTH IN THOSE DAYS SO MY GRANDFATHER COULD DO NOTHING BUT AWAIT THE RESULT EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER MAIL TO BOSTON
6269-66184-0004 HE COULD NOT HAVE AVAILED HIMSELF OF IT NOT KNOWING HOW TO ADDRESS A MESSAGE TO THE FUGITIVES THE POST OFFICE WAS NATURALLY THE LAST PLACE EITHER I OR THE ADMIRAL WOULD THINK OF VISITING
6269-66184-0005 MY GRANDFATHER HOWEVER WAS TOO FULL OF TROUBLE TO ALLOW THIS TO ADD TO HIS DISTRESS HE KNEW THAT THE FAITHFUL OLD SAILOR WOULD NOT LET ME COME TO ANY HARM AND EVEN IF I HAD MANAGED FOR THE TIME BEING TO ELUDE HIM
6269-66184-0006 WAS SURE TO BRING ME BACK SOONER OR LATER OUR RETURN THEREFORE BY THE FIRST TRAIN ON THE FOLLOWING DAY DID NOT SURPRISE HIM I WAS GREATLY PUZZLED AS I HAVE SAID BY THE GENTLE MANNER OF HIS RECEPTION
6269-66184-0007 AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO TELL ME
6269-66184-0008 IRRESOLUTELY AND THEN COMMENCED READING IT ALOUD
6269-66184-0009 I CAN'T READ IT TOM SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN BREAKING DOWN I THOUGHT I COULD HE HANDED IT TO ME I TOOK THE LETTER MECHANICALLY AND HURRIED AWAY WITH IT TO MY LITTLE ROOM
6269-66184-0010 THE WEEK THAT FOLLOWED THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER IS NEARLY A BLANK IN MY MEMORY I REMEMBER THAT THE DAYS APPEARED ENDLESS THAT AT TIMES I COULD NOT REALIZE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAD BEFALLEN US
6269-66184-0011 AND MY HEART UPBRAIDED ME FOR NOT FEELING A DEEPER GRIEF THAT A FULL SENSE OF MY LOSS WOULD NOW AND THEN SWEEP OVER ME LIKE AN INSPIRATION AND I WOULD STEAL AWAY TO MY CHAMBER
6269-66184-0012 I REMEMBER THIS BUT LITTLE MORE AS THE DAYS WENT BY MY FIRST GRIEF SUBSIDED AND IN ITS PLACE GREW UP A WANT WHICH I HAVE EXPERIENCED AT EVERY STEP IN LIFE FROM BOYHOOD TO MANHOOD OFTEN
6269-66184-0013 EVEN NOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WHEN I SEE A LAD OF TWELVE OR FOURTEEN WALKING BY HIS FATHER'S SIDE AND GLANCING MERRILY UP AT HIS FACE I TURN AND LOOK AFTER THEM AND AM CONSCIOUS THAT I HAVE MISSED COMPANIONSHIP MOST SWEET AND SACRED
6269-66184-0014 I SHALL NOT DWELL ON THIS PORTION OF MY STORY THERE WERE MANY TRANQUIL PLEASANT HOURS IN STORE FOR ME AT THAT PERIOD AND I PREFER TO TURN TO THEM
6269-66184-0015 MY MOTHER HAD ARRIVED AT NEW YORK AND WOULD BE WITH US THE NEXT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS YEARS IT SEEMED TO ME SOMETHING OF THE OLD CHEERFULNESS MINGLED WITH OUR CONVERSATION ROUND THE EVENING LAMP
6269-66184-0016 I WAS TO GO TO BOSTON WITH THE CAPTAIN TO MEET HER AND BRING HER HOME I NEED NOT DESCRIBE THAT MEETING WITH MY MOTHER'S HAND IN MINE ONCE MORE ALL THE LONG YEARS WE HAD BEEN PARTED APPEARED LIKE A DREAM
6269-66184-0017 VERY DEAR TO ME WAS THE SIGHT OF THAT SLENDER PALE WOMAN PASSING FROM ROOM TO ROOM AND LENDING A PATIENT GRACE AND BEAUTY TO THE SADDENED LIFE
6269-66184-0018 EVERYTHING WAS CHANGED WITH US NOW THERE WERE CONSULTATIONS WITH LAWYERS AND SIGNING OF PAPERS AND CORRESPONDENCE FOR MY FATHER'S AFFAIRS HAD BEEN LEFT IN GREAT CONFUSION
6269-66184-0019 THE EVENINGS WERE NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO HEAR ALL MY MOTHER HAD TO TELL OF THE SCENES SHE HAD PASSED THROUGH IN THE ILL FATED CITY THEN THERE WERE OLD TIMES TO TALK OVER FULL OF REMINISCENCES OF AUNT CHLOE AND LITTLE BLACK SAM
6269-66184-0020 LITTLE BLACK SAM BY THE BY HAD BEEN TAKEN BY HIS MASTER FROM MY FATHER'S SERVICE TEN MONTHS PREVIOUSLY AND PUT ON A SUGAR PLANTATION NEAR BATON ROUGE NOT RELISHING THE CHANGE SAM HAD RUN AWAY
6269-66184-0021 AND BY SOME MYSTERIOUS AGENCY GOT INTO CANADA
6269-66184-0022 INDECOROUS MESSAGES TO HIS LATE OWNER
6269-66184-0023 IN ONE OF THE CHOLERA HOSPITAL WARDS AND THE DESMOULINS NEAR NEIGHBORS OF OURS HAD PURCHASED THE PRETTY STONE HOUSE AMONG THE ORANGE TREES HOW ALL THESE SIMPLE DETAILS INTERESTED ME WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
6269-66184-0024 BY ANY BOY WHO HAS BEEN LONG ABSENT FROM HOME I WAS SORRY WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY TO DISCUSS QUESTIONS
6269-66184-0025 AND SEND ME TO COLLEGE FOR WHICH I WAS NEARLY FITTED BUT OUR MEANS DID NOT ADMIT OF THIS THE CAPTAIN TOO COULD ILL AFFORD TO BEAR THE EXPENSE FOR HIS LOSSES BY THE FAILURE OF THE NEW ORLEANS BUSINESS HAD BEEN HEAVY
6269-66184-0026 YET HE INSISTED ON THE PLAN NOT SEEING CLEARLY WHAT OTHER DISPOSAL TO MAKE OF ME IN THE MIDST OF OUR DISCUSSIONS A LETTER CAME FROM MY UNCLE SNOW A MERCHANT IN NEW YORK GENEROUSLY OFFERING ME A PLACE IN HIS COUNTING HOUSE
6269-66184-0027 THE CASE RESOLVED ITSELF INTO THIS IF I WENT TO COLLEGE I SHOULD HAVE TO BE DEPENDENT ON CAPTAIN NUTTER FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND AT THE END OF THE COLLEGIATE COURSE
6269-66184-0028 IF I ACCEPTED MY UNCLE'S OFFER I MIGHT HOPE TO WORK MY WAY TO INDEPENDENCE WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME IT WAS HARD TO GIVE UP THE LONG CHERISHED DREAM OF BEING A HARVARD BOY BUT I GAVE IT UP
6269-66184-0029 THE DECISION ONCE MADE IT WAS UNCLE SNOW'S WISH THAT I SHOULD ENTER HIS COUNTING HOUSE IMMEDIATELY THE CAUSE OF MY GOOD UNCLE'S HASTE WAS THIS HE WAS AFRAID THAT I WOULD TURN OUT TO BE A POET BEFORE HE COULD MAKE A MERCHANT OF ME
6269-66184-0030 HIS FEARS WERE BASED UPON THE FACT THAT I HAD PUBLISHED IN THE RIVERMOUTH BARNACLE SOME VERSES ADDRESSED IN A FAMILIAR MANNER TO THE MOON NOW THE IDEA OF A BOY WITH HIS LIVING TO GET
6269-66184-0031 STRUCK THE MERCANTILE MIND AS MONSTROUS IT WAS NOT ONLY A BAD INVESTMENT IT WAS LUNACY WE ADOPTED UNCLE SNOW'S VIEWS SO FAR AS TO ACCEDE TO HIS PROPOSITION FORTHWITH
6269-66184-0032 MY MOTHER I NEGLECTED TO SAY WAS ALSO TO RESIDE IN NEW YORK I SHALL NOT DRAW A PICTURE OF PEPPER WHITCOMB'S DISGUST WHEN THE NEWS WAS IMPARTED TO HIM NOR ATTEMPT TO PAINT SAILOR BEN'S DISTRESS AT THE PROSPECT
6269-66184-0033 OF LOSING HIS LITTLE MESSMATE IN THE EXCITEMENT OF PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY I DIDN'T FEEL ANY VERY DEEP REGRET MYSELF BUT WHEN THE MOMENT CAME FOR LEAVING AND I SAW MY SMALL TRUNK LASHED UP BEHIND THE CARRIAGE
6269-66184-0034 AND A MIST FILLED MY EYES SHUTTING OUT THE GROUP OF SCHOOLFELLOWS
6269-66184-0035 WHO HAD COME DOWN TO THE HOUSE TO SEE ME OFF AS THE CARRIAGE SWEPT ROUND THE CORNER I LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO TAKE A LAST LOOK AT SAILOR BEN'S COTTAGE AND THERE WAS THE ADMIRAL'S FLAG FLYING AT HALF MAST
