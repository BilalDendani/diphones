5854-50960-0007 AND THEY PROMPTLY STRUCK OFF FOR THE WATER THAT WAS STRAIGHTENED OUT AS BERT SAID BEYOND THE TEARING OF THE BREAKERS AT THE EDGE THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE IN THE SURF

5854-50960-0011 THERE WAS NOT A LIFE GUARD IN SIGHT AND HAL HAD TO HURRY OFF TO THE PIER FOR SOME RESTORATIVES FOR THE MAN WAS VERY WEAK ON HIS WAY HAL MET A GUARD WHO OF COURSE RAN TO THE SPOT WHERE HARRY AND BERT WERE GIVING THE MAN ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION

5854-50960-0013 THE BOTTOM AND HE CAUGHT HIS BREATH PAINFULLY THE MAN WAS ASSISTED TO A ROOM AT THE END OF THE PIER AND AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HE BECAME MUCH BETTER OF COURSE THE BOYS DID NOT STAND AROUND BEING SATISFIED THEY COULD BE OF NO MORE USE

5854-50960-0019 AS A CROWD OF CHILDREN WITH MANY LUNCH BOXES CAME RUNNING DOWN TO THE OCEAN HELLO THERE HELLO THERE CALLED EVERYBODY AT ONCE FOR OF COURSE ALL THE CHILDREN KNEW HARRY AND MANY ALSO KNEW BERT THERE WERE TOM MASON JACK HOPKINS AUGUST STOUT
5854-50960-0020 AND NED PRENTICE IN THE FIRST CROWD WHILE A NUMBER OF GIRLS FRIENDS OF NAN'S WERE IN ANOTHER GROUP NAN NELLIE AND DOROTHY HAD BEEN DETAINED BY SOMEBODY FURTHER UP ON THE ROAD BUT WERE NOW COMING DOWN SLOWLY SUCH A DELIGHT AS THE OCEAN WAS TO THE COUNTRY CHILDREN
5854-50960-0021 AS EACH ROLLER SLIPPED OUT ON THE SANDS THE CHILDREN UNCONSCIOUSLY FOLLOWED IT AND SO MANY UNSUSPECTED PAIRS OF SHOES WERE CAUGHT BY THE NEXT WAVE THAT WASHED IN WELL HERE COMES UNCLE DANIEL CALLED BERT AS SURE ENOUGH
5854-50960-0022 DOWN TO THE EDGE CAME UNCLE DANIEL WITH DOROTHY HOLDING ON ONE ARM NAN CLINGING TO THE OTHER WHILE NELLIE CARRIED HIS SMALL SATCHEL SANTA CLAUS COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE WELCOME TO THE BOBBSEYS AT THAT MOMENT THAN WAS UNCLE DANIEL
5854-50960-0023 THEY SIMPLY OVERPOWERED HIM AS THE SURPRISE OF HIS COMING MADE THE TREAT SO MUCH BETTER THE GIRLS HAD DRAGGED HIM DOWN TO THE OCEAN HE SAID WHEN HE HAD INTENDED FIRST GOING TO AUNT EMILY'S I MUST SEE THE OTHERS HE INSISTED FREDDIE AND FLOSSIE
5854-50960-0024 AUNT SARAH TOO IS COMING ALL RIGHT THEN AGREED UNCLE DANIEL I'LL WAIT AWHILE WELL HARRY YOU LOOK LIKE AN INDIAN CAN YOU SEE THROUGH THAT COAT OF TAN HARRY LAUGHED AND SAID HE HAD BEEN AN INDIAN IN HAVING A GOOD TIME
5854-50960-0025 PRESENTLY SOMEBODY JUMPED UP ON UNCLE DANIEL'S BACK AS HE WAS SITTING ON THE SANDS THE SHOCK ALMOST BROUGHT HIM DOWN OF COURSE IT WAS FREDDIE WHO WAS SO OVERJOYED HE REALLY TREATED THE GOOD NATURED UNCLE A LITTLE ROUGHLY FREDDIE BOY FREDDIE BOY

5854-50960-0027 THIS EXPLANATION MADE UNCLE DANIEL LAUGH HEARTILY THE WHOLE FAMILY SAT AROUND ON THE SANDS AND IT WAS LIKE BEING IN THE COUNTRY AND AT THE SEASHORE AT THE ONE TIME FLOSSIE DECLARED THE BOYS OF COURSE WERE IN THE WATER
5854-50960-0028 AUGUST STOUT HAD NOT LEARNED MUCH ABOUT SWIMMING SINCE HE FELL OFF THE PLANK WHILE FISHING IN MEADOW BROOK SO THAT OUT IN THE WAVES THE OTHER BOYS HAD GREAT FUN WITH THEIR FAT FRIEND AND THERE IS NETTIE PRENTICE EXCLAIMED NAN SUDDENLY
5854-50960-0029 EVIDENTLY SEARCHING FOR FRIENDS OH NAN CALLED NETTIE IN DELIGHT I'M JUST AS GLAD TO SEE YOU AS I AM TO SEE THE OCEAN AND I NEVER SAW THAT BEFORE AND THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS EXCHANGED GREETINGS OF GENUINE LOVE FOR EACH OTHER

5854-50960-0031 IN EVERY POSSIBLE CORNER WHERE FUN MIGHT BE HIDDEN AS SOON AS THE BOYS WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR BATH THEY WENT IN SEARCH OF THE BIG SUN UMBRELLAS SO THAT UNCLE WILLIAM AUNT EMILY MISSUS BOBBSEY AND AUNT SARAH MIGHT SIT UNDER THE SUNSHADES WHILE EATING LUNCH
5854-50960-0032 THEN THE BOYS GOT LONG BOARDS AND ARRANGED THEM FROM BENCH TO BENCH IN PICNIC STYLE SO THAT ALL THE MEADOW BROOK FRIENDS MIGHT HAVE A PLEASANT TIME EATING THEIR BOX LUNCHES LET'S MAKE LEMONADE SUGGESTED HAL

5854-50960-0037 THAT EACH PERSON TRIED TO GET THE CUP TO HIS OR HER MOUTH IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE STOPPED AT THE HYDRANT AND WASHED THE GOURDS THOROUGHLY DECLARED HAL SO YOU NEED NOT EXPECT TO FIND ANY MEXICAN DIAMONDS IN THEM

5854-50960-0039 THEN NAN FILLED HIS GOURD FROM THE DIPPER THAT STOOD IN THE BIG PAIL OF LEMONADE AND HE SMACKED HIS LIPS IN APPRECIATION THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO AND SO MUCH TO SEE THAT THE FEW HOURS ALLOWED THE EXCURSIONISTS SLIPPED BY ALL TOO QUICKLY
5854-50960-0040 DOROTHY RAN AWAY AND SOON RETURNED WITH HER DONKEY CART TO TAKE NETTIE PRENTICE AND A FEW OF NETTIE'S FRIENDS FOR A RIDE ALONG THE BEACH NAN AND NELLIE DID NOT GO PREFERRING TO GIVE THE TREAT TO THE LITTLE COUNTRY GIRLS
5854-50960-0041 NOW DON'T GO FAR DIRECTED AUNT EMILY FOR AUNT SARAH AND UNCLE DANIEL WERE ALREADY LEAVING THE BEACH TO MAKE READY FOR THE TRAIN OF COURSE HARRY AND AUNT SARAH WERE ALL PACKED UP
