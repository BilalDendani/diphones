1271-136861-0000 AN EVENING NEWS PAPER AND EVEN IN SO SLIGHT A PERFORMANCE EXHIBITED PECULIAR TALENTS
1271-136861-0001 WHY I WISH FOR IT IS THIS WHEN DOCTOR MADDEN CAME TO LONDON HE SUBMITTED THAT WORK TO MY CASTIGATION AND I REMEMBER I BLOTTED A GREAT MANY LINES AND MIGHT HAVE BLOTTED MANY MORE WITHOUT MAKING THE POEM WORSE
1271-136861-0002 HOWEVER THE DOCTOR WAS VERY THANKFUL AND VERY GENEROUS
1271-136861-0003 THE FATHER OF HIS MUCH VALUED FRIEND BUT HE DID NOT ACCEPT OF IT
1271-136861-0004 FORTY EIGHT IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY SEVEN IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT HE PUBLISHED ANY THING EXCEPT SOME OF THOSE ARTICLES IN THE LITERARY MAGAZINE
1271-136861-0005 AND HE DICTATED A SPEECH ON THE SUBJECT OF AN ADDRESS TO THE THRONE AFTER THE EXPEDITION TO ROCHFORT
1271-136861-0006 OR BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE OF IRELAND AND THAT OF BISCAY DESERVES ENQUIRY OF THESE PROVINCIAL AND UNEXTENDED TONGUES IT SELDOM HAPPENS THAT MORE THAN ONE ARE UNDERSTOOD BY ANY ONE MAN
1271-136861-0007 AND THEREFORE IT SELDOM HAPPENS THAT A FAIR COMPARISON CAN BE MADE I HOPE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE THIS KIND OF LEARNING
1271-136861-0008 AND WHICH IF IT BE SUFFERED TO REMAIN IN OBLIVION FOR ANOTHER CENTURY MAY PERHAPS NEVER BE RETRIEVED AS I WISH WELL TO ALL USEFUL UNDERTAKINGS

1271-136861-0011 IN LYNNE NORFOLK SIR THAT I MAY SHEW MYSELF SENSIBLE OF YOUR FAVOURS AND NOT COMMIT THE SAME FAULT A SECOND TIME
1271-136861-0012 THE TRUTH IS THE OTHER LIKEWISE WAS RECEIVED AND I WROTE AN ANSWER BUT BEING DESIROUS TO TRANSMIT YOU SOME PROPOSALS AND RECEIPTS I WAITED TILL I COULD FIND A CONVENIENT CONVEYANCE
1271-136861-0013 AND DAY WAS PASSED AFTER DAY TILL OTHER THINGS DROVE IT FROM MY THOUGHTS YET NOT SO BUT THAT I REMEMBER WITH GREAT PLEASURE YOUR COMMENDATION OF MY DICTIONARY YOUR PRAISE WAS WELCOME
1271-136861-0014 DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO DEPRESS ME WITH THREATS OF CENSURE FROM THE PUBLICK OR WITH OBJECTIONS LEARNED FROM THOSE WHO HAD LEARNED THEM FROM MY OWN PREFACE YOUR'S IS THE ONLY LETTER OF GOODWILL THAT I HAVE RECEIVED

1271-136861-0020 THAT I SHOULD BE AT FORTY NINE WHAT I NOW AM
1271-136861-0021 YOU ARE BUSY IN ACQUIRING AND IN COMMUNICATING KNOWLEDGE AND WHILE YOU ARE STUDYING ENJOY THE END OF STUDY BY MAKING OTHERS WISER AND HAPPIER
1271-136861-0022 LOOK WITH SOME DEGREE OF INNOCENT ENVY ON THOSE WHO MAY BE SAID TO BE BORN TO FRIENDS AND CANNOT SEE WITHOUT WONDER HOW RARELY THAT NATIVE UNION IS AFTERWARDS REGARDED
1271-136861-0023 IT SOMETIMES INDEED HAPPENS THAT SOME SUPERVENIENT CAUSE OF DISCORD MAY OVERPOWER THIS ORIGINAL AMITY BUT IT SEEMS TO ME MORE FREQUENTLY THROWN AWAY WITH LEVITY
1271-136861-0024 OR LOST BY NEGLIGENCE THAN DESTROYED BY INJURY OR VIOLENCE WE TELL THE LADIES THAT GOOD WIVES MAKE GOOD HUSBANDS I BELIEVE IT IS A MORE CERTAIN POSITION

1271-136861-0031 I AM SIR YOUR MOST OBLIGED AND MOST HUMBLE SERVANT SAM JOHNSON LONDON MARCH EIGHTH SEVENTEEN FIFTY EIGHT
1271-136861-0032 DOCTOR BURNEY HAS KINDLY FAVOURED ME WITH THE FOLLOWING MEMORANDUM WHICH I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO INSERT IN HIS OWN GENUINE EASY STYLE I LOVE TO EXHIBIT SKETCHES OF MY ILLUSTRIOUS FRIEND
1271-136861-0033 BY VARIOUS EMINENT HANDS
1271-136861-0034 SOON AFTER THIS MISTER BURNEY DURING A VISIT TO THE CAPITAL
1271-136861-0035 AT THE MERCHANT OF VENICE HE OBSERVED TO HIM THAT HE SEEMED TO BE MORE SEVERE ON WARBURTON THAN THEOBALD O POOR TIB SAID JOHNSON HE WAS READY KNOCKED DOWN TO MY HANDS
1271-136861-0036 WARBURTON STANDS BETWEEN ME AND HIM BUT SIR SAID MISTER BURNEY YOU'LL HAVE WARBURTON UPON YOUR BONES WON'T YOU NO SIR HE'LL NOT COME OUT
1271-136861-0037 HE'LL ONLY GROWL IN HIS DEN BUT YOU THINK SIR THAT WARBURTON IS A SUPERIOUR CRITICK TO THEOBALD O SIR HE'D MAKE TWO AND FIFTY THEOBALDS
1271-136861-0038 THAT HE HAS A RAGE FOR SAYING SOMETHING
1271-136861-0039 OF WHICH NUMBERS THIRTY THREE NINETY THREE AND NINETY SIX WERE WRITTEN BY MISTER THOMAS WARTON
1271-136861-0040 AND NUMBERS SEVENTY SIX SEVENTY NINE AND EIGHTY TWO BY SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS
1271-136861-0041 AND POLLUTE HIS CANVAS WITH DEFORMITY BEING ADDED BY JOHNSON AS SIR JOSHUA INFORMED ME
1271-136861-0042 THE IDLER IS EVIDENTLY THE WORK OF THE SAME MIND WHICH PRODUCED THE RAMBLER BUT HAS LESS BODY
1271-136861-0043 HE THEN FOLDED IT UP AND SENT IT OFF YET THERE ARE IN THE IDLER
1271-136861-0044 AND LABOUR OF LANGUAGE AS ANY OF THIS GREAT MAN'S WRITINGS
1271-136861-0045 DEATH OF A FRIEND
1271-136861-0046 DOMESTICK GREATNESS UNATTAINABLE
1271-136861-0047 THE USUAL TRAPPING OF PERIODICAL PAPERS IS PREFIXED TO VERY FEW OF THE IDLERS AS I HAVE HEARD JOHNSON COMMEND THE CUSTOM
1271-136861-0048 NOR ON SOME OCCASIONS HAS HE REPRESSED THAT POWER OF SOPHISTRY WHICH HE POSSESSED IN SO EMINENT A DEGREE
1271-136861-0049 AND LIVE IN DEPENDENCE ON THE WEATHER AND THE WIND FOR THE ONLY BLESSINGS WHICH NATURE HAS PUT INTO OUR POWER TRANQUILLITY AND BENEVOLENCE THIS DISTINCTION OF SEASONS
1271-136861-0050 IS PRODUCED ONLY BY IMAGINATION OPERATING ON LUXURY TO TEMPERANCE EVERY DAY IS BRIGHT AND EVERY HOUR IS PROPITIOUS TO DILIGENCE
1271-136861-0051 HE THAT SHALL RESOLUTELY EXCITE HIS FACULTIES OR EXERT HIS VIRTUES WILL SOON MAKE HIMSELF SUPERIOUR TO THE SEASONS AND MAY SET AT DEFIANCE THE MORNING MIST
1271-136861-0052 THE PALSY AND ALL OTHER BODILY DISORDERS SUCH BOASTING OF THE MIND IS FALSE ELEVATION HIS UNQUALIFIED RIDICULE OF RHETORICAL GESTURE OR ACTION
1271-136861-0053 IS NOT SURELY A TEST OF TRUTH YET WE CANNOT HELP ADMIRING HOW WELL IT IS ADAPTED TO PRODUCE THE EFFECT WHICH HE WISHED
1271-136861-0054 NEITHER THE JUDGES OF OUR LAWS NOR THE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR PEOPLE
1271-136861-0055 OR BELIEVE ANY MAN THE MORE BECAUSE HE ROLLED HIS EYES OR PUFFED HIS CHEEKS OR SPREAD ABROAD HIS ARMS OR STAMPED THE GROUND OR THUMPED HIS BREAST
1271-136861-0056 OR TURNED HIS EYES SOMETIMES TO THE CEILING
