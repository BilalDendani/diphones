1160-139336-0000 THE LAST A PUNISHER SOCIETY IN EVERY STATE IS A BLESSING BUT GOVERNMENT EVEN IN ITS BEST STATE IS BUT A NECESSARY EVIL IN ITS WORST STATE AN INTOLERABLE ONE FOR WHEN WE SUFFER OR ARE EXPOSED TO THE SAME MISERIES
1160-139336-0001 BY A GOVERNMENT WHICH WE MIGHT EXPECT IN A COUNTRY WITHOUT GOVERNMENT OUR CALAMITY IS HEIGHTENED BY REFLECTING THAT WE FURNISH THE MEANS BY WHICH WE SUFFER GOVERNMENT LIKE DRESS IS THE BADGE OF LOST INNOCENCE
1160-139336-0002 THE PALACES OF KINGS ARE BUILT ON THE RUINS OF THE BOWERS OF PARADISE
1160-139336-0003 UNIFORM AND IRRESISTIBLY OBEYED MAN WOULD NEED NO OTHER LAWGIVER BUT THAT NOT BEING THE CASE HE FINDS IT NECESSARY TO SURRENDER UP A PART OF HIS PROPERTY TO FURNISH MEANS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE REST
1160-139336-0004 AND THIS HE IS INDUCED TO DO BY THE SAME PRUDENCE WHICH IN EVERY OTHER CASE ADVISES HIM OUT OF TWO EVILS TO CHOOSE THE LEAST WHEREFORE SECURITY BEING THE TRUE DESIGN AND END OF GOVERNMENT IT UNANSWERABLY FOLLOWS
1160-139336-0005 THAT WHATEVER FORM THEREOF APPEARS MOST LIKELY TO ENSURE IT TO US WITH THE LEAST EXPENCE AND GREATEST BENEFIT IS PREFERABLE TO ALL OTHERS IN ORDER TO GAIN A CLEAR AND JUST IDEA OF THE DESIGN AND END OF GOVERNMENT
1160-139336-0006 LET US SUPPOSE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS SETTLED IN SOME SEQUESTERED PART OF THE EARTH UNCONNECTED WITH THE REST
1160-139336-0007 OR OF THE WORLD IN THIS STATE OF NATURAL LIBERTY SOCIETY WILL BE THEIR FIRST THOUGHT
1160-139336-0008 THE STRENGTH OF ONE MAN IS SO UNEQUAL TO HIS WANTS
1160-139336-0009 THAT HE IS SOON OBLIGED TO SEEK ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF OF ANOTHER WHO IN HIS TURN REQUIRES THE SAME FOUR OR FIVE UNITED WOULD BE ABLE TO RAISE A TOLERABLE DWELLING IN THE MIDST OF A WILDERNESS
1160-139336-0010 WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ANY THING WHEN HE HAD FELLED HIS TIMBER HE COULD NOT REMOVE IT NOR ERECT IT AFTER IT WAS REMOVED HUNGER IN THE MEAN TIME WOULD URGE HIM FROM HIS WORK AND EVERY DIFFERENT WANT
1160-139336-0011 CALL HIM A DIFFERENT WAY DISEASE NAY EVEN MISFORTUNE WOULD BE DEATH FOR THOUGH NEITHER MIGHT BE MORTAL YET EITHER WOULD DISABLE HIM FROM LIVING AND REDUCE HIM TO A STATE IN WHICH HE MIGHT RATHER BE SAID TO PERISH THAN TO DIE
1160-139336-0012 WHILE THEY REMAINED PERFECTLY JUST TO EACH OTHER BUT AS NOTHING BUT HEAVEN IS IMPREGNABLE TO VICE IT WILL UNAVOIDABLY HAPPEN THAT IN PROPORTION AS THEY SURMOUNT THE FIRST DIFFICULTIES OF EMIGRATION WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER IN A COMMON CAUSE
1160-139336-0013 THEY WILL BEGIN TO RELAX IN THEIR DUTY AND ATTACHMENT TO EACH OTHER AND THIS REMISSNESS WILL POINT OUT THE NECESSITY OF ESTABLISHING SOME FORM OF GOVERNMENT TO SUPPLY THE DEFECT OF MORAL VIRTUE SOME CONVENIENT TREE WILL AFFORD THEM A STATE HOUSE
1160-139336-0014 UNDER THE BRANCHES OF WHICH THE WHOLE COLONY MAY ASSEMBLE TO DELIBERATE ON PUBLIC MATTERS IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THEIR FIRST LAWS WILL HAVE THE TITLE ONLY OF REGULATIONS AND BE ENFORCED BY NO OTHER PENALTY
1160-139336-0015 IN THIS FIRST PARLIAMENT EVERY MAN BY NATURAL RIGHT WILL HAVE A SEAT BUT AS THE COLONY INCREASES THE PUBLIC CONCERNS WILL INCREASE LIKEWISE AND THE DISTANCE AT WHICH THE MEMBERS MAY BE SEPARATED
1160-139336-0016 WILL RENDER IT TOO INCONVENIENT FOR ALL OF THEM TO MEET ON EVERY OCCASION AS AT FIRST WHEN THEIR NUMBER WAS SMALL THEIR HABITATIONS NEAR AND THE PUBLIC CONCERNS FEW AND TRIFLING
1160-139336-0017 TO BE MANAGED BY A SELECT NUMBER CHOSEN FROM THE WHOLE BODY WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AT STAKE WHICH THOSE HAVE WHO APPOINTED THEM AND WHO WILL ACT IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE WHOLE BODY WOULD ACT WERE THEY PRESENT
1160-139336-0018 EACH PART SENDING ITS PROPER NUMBER AND THAT THE ELECTED MIGHT NEVER FORM TO THEMSELVES AN INTEREST SEPARATE FROM THE ELECTORS PRUDENCE WILL POINT OUT THE PROPRIETY OF HAVING ELECTIONS OFTEN BECAUSE AS THE ELECTED
1160-139336-0019 AND AS THIS FREQUENT INTERCHANGE WILL ESTABLISH A COMMON INTEREST WITH EVERY PART OF THE COMMUNITY THEY WILL MUTUALLY AND NATURALLY SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND ON THIS NOT ON THE UNMEANING NAME OF KING DEPENDS THE STRENGTH OF GOVERNMENT
1160-139336-0020 AND THE HAPPINESS OF THE GOVERNED HERE THEN IS THE ORIGIN AND RISE OF GOVERNMENT NAMELY A MODE RENDERED NECESSARY BY THE INABILITY OF MORAL VIRTUE TO GOVERN THE WORLD HERE TOO IS THE DESIGN AND END OF GOVERNMENT VIZ
1160-139336-0021 FREEDOM AND SECURITY AND HOWEVER OUR EYES MAY BE DAZZLED WITH SNOW OR OUR EARS DECEIVED BY SOUND HOWEVER PREJUDICE MAY WARP OUR WILLS OR INTEREST DARKEN OUR UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLE VOICE OF NATURE AND OF REASON WILL SAY IT IS RIGHT
1160-139336-0022 FROM A PRINCIPLE IN NATURE WHICH NO ART CAN OVERTURN VIZ THAT THE MORE SIMPLE ANY THING IS THE LESS LIABLE IT IS TO BE DISORDERED AND THE EASIER REPAIRED WHEN DISORDERED
1160-139336-0023 AND WITH THIS MAXIM IN VIEW I OFFER A FEW REMARKS ON THE SO MUCH BOASTED CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND
1160-139336-0024 IN WHICH IT WAS ERECTED IS GRANTED WHEN THE WORLD WAS OVER RUN WITH TYRANNY THE LEAST REMOVE THEREFROM WAS A GLORIOUS RESCUE BUT THAT IT IS IMPERFECT SUBJECT TO CONVULSIONS AND INCAPABLE OF PRODUCING WHAT IT SEEMS TO PROMISE
1160-139336-0025 IS EASILY DEMONSTRATED ABSOLUTE GOVERNMENTS THO THE DISGRACE OF HUMAN NATURE HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE WITH THEM THAT THEY ARE SIMPLE IF THE PEOPLE SUFFER THEY KNOW THE HEAD FROM WHICH THEIR SUFFERING SPRINGS KNOW LIKEWISE THE REMEDY
1160-139336-0026 AND EVERY POLITICAL PHYSICIAN WILL ADVISE A DIFFERENT MEDICINE I KNOW IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET OVER LOCAL OR LONG STANDING PREJUDICES YET IF WE WILL SUFFER OURSELVES TO EXAMINE THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
1160-139336-0027 WE SHALL FIND THEM TO BE THE BASE REMAINS OF TWO ANCIENT TYRANNIES COMPOUNDED WITH SOME NEW REPUBLICAN MATERIALS FIRST THE REMAINS OF MONARCHICAL TYRANNY IN THE PERSON OF THE KING SECONDLY THE REMAINS OF ARISTOCRATICAL TYRANNY
1160-139336-0028 IN THE PERSONS OF THE PEERS THIRDLY THE NEW REPUBLICAN MATERIALS IN THE PERSONS OF THE COMMONS ON WHOSE VIRTUE DEPENDS THE FREEDOM OF ENGLAND THE TWO FIRST BY BEING HEREDITARY ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE PEOPLE
1160-139336-0029 CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE THEY CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TOWARDS THE FREEDOM OF THE STATE TO SAY THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND IS A UNION OF THREE POWERS RECIPROCALLY CHECKING EACH OTHER IS FARCICAL EITHER THE WORDS HAVE NO MEANING OR THEY ARE
1160-139336-0030 SECONDLY THAT THE COMMONS BY BEING APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE ARE EITHER WISER OR MORE WORTHY OF CONFIDENCE THAN THE CROWN BUT AS THE SAME CONSTITUTION WHICH GIVES THE COMMONS A POWER TO CHECK THE KING BY WITHHOLDING THE SUPPLIES
1160-139336-0031 GIVES AFTERWARDS THE KING A POWER TO CHECK THE COMMONS BY EMPOWERING HIM TO REJECT THEIR OTHER BILLS IT AGAIN SUPPOSES THAT THE KING IS WISER THAN THOSE WHOM IT HAS ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE WISER THAN HIM A MERE ABSURDITY
1160-139336-0032 THERE IS SOMETHING EXCEEDINGLY RIDICULOUS IN THE COMPOSITION OF MONARCHY IT FIRST EXCLUDES A MAN FROM THE MEANS OF INFORMATION YET EMPOWERS HIM TO ACT IN CASES WHERE THE HIGHEST JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED THE STATE OF A KING SHUTS HIM FROM THE WORLD
1160-139336-0033 YET THE BUSINESS OF A KING REQUIRES HIM TO KNOW IT THOROUGHLY WHEREFORE THE DIFFERENT PARTS BY UNNATURALLY OPPOSING AND DESTROYING EACH OTHER PROVE THE WHOLE CHARACTER TO BE ABSURD AND USELESS SOME WRITERS HAVE EXPLAINED THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION THUS
1160-139336-0034 THE PEOPLE ANOTHER THE PEERS ARE AN HOUSE IN BEHALF OF THE KING THE COMMONS IN BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE BUT THIS HATH ALL THE DISTINCTIONS OF AN HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF AND THOUGH THE EXPRESSIONS BE PLEASANTLY ARRANGED
1160-139336-0035 YET WHEN EXAMINED THEY APPEAR IDLE AND AMBIGUOUS AND IT WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN THAT THE NICEST CONSTRUCTION THAT WORDS ARE CAPABLE OF WHEN APPLIED TO THE DESCRIPTION OF SOME THING WHICH EITHER CANNOT EXIST OR IS TOO INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO BE WITHIN THE COMPASS OF DESCRIPTION
1160-139336-0036 OR AS THE PHRASE IS CHECK THE RAPIDITY OF ITS MOTION YET SO LONG AS THEY CANNOT STOP IT THEIR ENDEAVORS WILL BE INEFFECTUAL THE FIRST MOVING POWER WILL AT LAST HAVE ITS WAY AND WHAT IT WANTS IN SPEED IS SUPPLIED BY TIME
1160-139336-0037 THAT THE CROWN IS THIS OVERBEARING PART IN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION NEEDS NOT BE MENTIONED AND THAT IT DERIVES ITS WHOLE CONSEQUENCE MERELY FROM BEING THE GIVER OF PLACES AND PENSIONS IS SELF EVIDENT WHEREFORE
1160-139336-0038 THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN WISE ENOUGH TO SHUT AND LOCK A DOOR AGAINST ABSOLUTE MONARCHY WE AT THE SAME TIME HAVE BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO PUT THE CROWN IN POSSESSION OF THE KEY THE PREJUDICE OF ENGLISHMEN IN FAVOUR OF THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT BY KING LORDS AND COMMONS
1160-139336-0039 IT IS HANDED TO THE PEOPLE UNDER THE MORE FORMIDABLE SHAPE OF AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT FOR THE FATE OF CHARLES THE FIRST HATH ONLY MADE KINGS MORE SUBTLE NOT MORE JUST
