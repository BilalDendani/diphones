3906-23193-0000 WHAT ITS SIGNIFICANCE MIGHT PROVE LIKELY TO BE WHEN SHE FACED IT SHE HAD NOT KNOWN IT IS TRUE BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT FROM FROM ANYTHING AS THEY WALKED UP THE SUN DAPPLED AVENUE SHE KEPT GLANCING ASIDE AT ROSY AND ENDEAVOURING TO DRAW USEFUL CONCLUSIONS
3906-23193-0001 THE POOR GIRL'S AIR OF BEING A PLAIN INSIGNIFICANT FRUMP LONG PAST YOUTH STRUCK AN EXTRAORDINARY AND FOR THE TIME UNEXPLAINABLE NOTE HER ILL CUT OUT OF DATE DRESS THE CHEAP SUIT OF THE HUNCHBACKED BOY WHO LIMPED PATIENTLY ALONG HELPED BY HIS CRUTCH
3906-23193-0002 SUGGESTED POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS WHICH WERE WITHOUT DOUBT CONNECTED WITH THE THOUGHT
3906-23193-0003 WHAT EXTRAORDINARY DISPOSAL WAS BEING MADE OF ROSY'S MONEY BUT HER EACH GLANCE AT HER SISTER ALSO SUGGESTED COMPLICATION UPON COMPLICATION THE SINGULAR HALF HOUR UNDER THE TREES BY THE POOL SPENT AFTER THE FIRST HYSTERIC MOMENTS WERE OVER
3906-23193-0004 IN VAGUE EXCLAIMINGS AND QUESTIONS WHICH SEEMED HALF FRIGHTENED AND ALL AT SEA HAD GRADUALLY SHOWN HER THAT SHE WAS TALKING TO A CREATURE WHOLLY OTHER THAN THE ROSALIE WHO HAD SO WELL KNOWN AND LOVED THEM ALL AND WHOM THEY HAD SO WELL LOVED AND KNOWN
3906-23193-0005 THEY DID NOT KNOW THIS ONE AND SHE DID NOT KNOW THEM SHE WAS EVEN A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE STIR AND MOVEMENT OF THEIR LIFE AND BEING THE ROSY THEY HAD KNOWN SEEMED TO BE IMPRISONED WITHIN THE WALL THE YEARS OF HER SEPARATED LIFE HAD BUILT ABOUT HER AT EACH BREATH SHE DREW
3906-23193-0006 BETTINA SAW HOW LONG THE YEARS HAD BEEN TO HER AND HOW FAR HER HOME HAD SEEMED TO LIE AWAY SO FAR THAT IT COULD NOT TOUCH HER AND WAS ONLY A SORT OF DREAM THE RECALLING OF WHICH MADE HER SUDDENLY BEGIN TO CRY AGAIN EVERY FEW MINUTES
3906-23193-0007 TO BETTINA'S SENSITIVELY ALERT MIND IT WAS PLAIN THAT IT WOULD NOT DO IN THE LEAST TO DRAG HER SUDDENLY OUT OF HER PRISON OR CLOISTER WHICHSOEVER IT MIGHT BE TO DO SO WOULD BE LIKE FORCING A CREATURE ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO DARKNESS TO STARE AT THE BLAZING SUN
3906-23193-0008 TO HAVE BURST UPON HER WITH THE OLD IMPETUOUS CANDID FONDNESS
3906-23193-0009 AS IF WITH SOMETHING BORDERING ON INDECENCY SHE COULD NOT HAVE STOOD IT PERHAPS SUCH FONDNESS WAS SO REMOTE FROM HER IN THESE DAYS THAT SHE HAD EVEN CEASED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT WHERE ARE YOUR LITTLE GIRLS BETTINA ASKED
3906-23193-0010 REMEMBERING THAT THERE HAD BEEN NOTICE GIVEN OF THE ADVENT OF TWO GIRL BABIES THEY DIED LADY ANSTRUTHERS ANSWERED UNEMOTIONALLY
3906-23193-0011 THERE IS ONLY UGHTRED BETTY GLANCED AT THE BOY AND SAW A SMALL FLAME OF RED CREEP UP ON HIS CHEEK INSTINCTIVELY SHE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT AND SHE PUT OUT HER HAND AND LIGHTLY TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE ME UGHTRED SHE SAID
3906-23193-0012 HE ALMOST STARTED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE BUT WHEN HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS HER HE ONLY GREW REDDER AND LOOKED AWKWARD WITHOUT ANSWERING HIS MANNER WAS THAT OF A BOY WHO WAS UNUSED TO THE AMENITIES OF POLITE SOCIETY AND WHO WAS ONLY MADE SHY BY THEM
3906-23193-0013 WITHOUT WARNING A MOMENT OR SO LATER BETTINA STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AVENUE AND LOOKED UP AT THE ARCHING GIANT BRANCHES OF THE TREES WHICH HAD REACHED OUT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER AS IF TO CLASP HANDS OR ENCOMPASS AN INTERLACING EMBRACE
3906-23193-0014 AS FAR AS THE EYE REACHED THEY DID THIS AND THE BEHOLDER STOOD AS IN A HIGH STATELY PERGOLA WITH BREAKS OF DEEP AZURE SKY BETWEEN SEVERAL MELLOW CAWING ROOKS WERE FLOATING SOLEMNLY BENEATH OR ABOVE THE BRANCHES NOW WAND THEN SETTLING IN SOME HIGHEST ONE
3906-23193-0015 OR DISAPPEARING IN THE THICK GREENNESS LADY ANSTRUTHERS STOPPED WHEN HER SISTER DID SO AND GLANCED AT HER IN VAGUE INQUIRY IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE HAD OUTLIVED EVEN HER SENSE OF THE BEAUTY SURROUNDING HER
3906-23193-0016 SHE ASKED AT ALL OF IT BETTY ANSWERED IT IS SO WONDERFUL SHE LIKES IT SAID UGHTRED AND THEN RATHER SLUNK A STEP BEHIND HIS MOTHER AS IF HE WERE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
3906-23193-0017 THE HOUSE IS JUST BEYOND THOSE TREES SAID LADY ANSTRUTHERS THEY CAME IN FULL VIEW OF IT THREE MINUTES LATER
3906-23193-0018 SHE LIKES THAT TOO SAID UGHTRED AND ALTHOUGH HE SAID IT SHEEPISHLY THERE WAS IMPERFECTLY CONCEALED BENEATH THE AWKWARDNESS A PLEASURE IN THE FACT DO YOU ASKED ROSALIE WITH HER SMALL PAINFUL SMILE BETTY LAUGHED
3906-23193-0019 IT IS TOO PICTURESQUE IN ITS SPECIAL WAY TO BE QUITE CREDIBLE SHE SAID I THOUGHT THAT WHEN I FIRST SAW IT SAID ROSY DON'T YOU THINK SO NOW WELL WAS THE RATHER UNCERTAIN REPLY
3906-23193-0020 WHY LET IT FALL TO PIECES BETTY PUT IT TO HER WITH IMPARTIAL PROMPTNESS WE HAVEN'T MONEY ENOUGH TO HOLD IT TOGETHER RESIGNEDLY AS THEY CLIMBED THE LOW BROAD LICHEN BLOTCHED STEPS WHOSE BROKEN STONE BALUSTRADES WERE ALMOST HIDDEN IN CLUTCHING UNTRIMMED IVY
3906-23193-0021 BETTY FELT THEM TO BE ALMOST INCREDIBLE TOO THE UNEVEN STONES OF THE TERRACE THE STEPS MOUNTED TO WERE LICHEN BLOTCHED AND BROKEN ALSO TUFTS OF GREEN GROWTHS HAD FORCED THEMSELVES BETWEEN THE FLAGS AND ADDED AN UNTIDY BEAUTY
3906-23193-0022 THE IVY TOSSED IN BRANCHES OVER THE RED ROOF AND WALLS OF THE HOUSE IT HAD BEEN LEFT UNCLIPPED UNTIL IT WAS RATHER AN ENDLESSLY CLAMBERING TREE THAN A CREEPER THE HALL THEY ENTERED HAD THE BEAUTY OF SPACIOUS FORM AND GOOD OLD OAKEN PANELLING
3906-23193-0023 THERE WERE DEEP WINDOW SEATS AND AN ANCIENT HIGH BACKED SETTLE OR SO AND A MASSIVE TABLE BY THE FIRELESS HEARTH BUT THERE WERE NO PICTURES IN PLACES WHERE PICTURES HAD EVIDENTLY ONCE HUNG AND THE ONLY COVERINGS ON THE STONE FLOOR WERE THE FADED REMNANTS OF A CENTRAL RUG AND A WORN TIGER SKIN
3906-23193-0024 THE HEAD ALMOST BALD AND A GLASS EYE KNOCKED OUT BETTINA TOOK IN THE UNPROMISING DETAILS WITHOUT A QUIVER OF THE EXTRAVAGANT LASHES THESE INDEED AND THE EYES PERTAINING TO THEM SEEMED RATHER TO SWEEP THE FINE ROOF AND A CERTAIN MINSTREL'S GALLERY AND STAIRCASE
3906-23193-0025 THAN WHICH NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH FINER WITH THE LOOK OF AN APPRECIATIVE ADMIRER OF ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES AND OLD OAK SHE HAD NOT JOURNEYED TO STORNHAM COURT WITH THE INTENTION OF DISTURBING ROSY OR OF BEING HERSELF OBVIOUSLY DISTURBED
3906-23193-0026 SHE HAD COME TO OBSERVE SITUATIONS AND REARRANGE THEM WITH THAT INTELLIGENCE OF WHICH UNCONSIDERED EMOTION OR EXCLAMATION FORM NO PART IT IS THE FIRST OLD ENGLISH HOUSE I HAVE SEEN SHE SAID WITH A SIGH OF PLEASURE I AM SO GLAD ROSY
3906-23193-0027 SHE PUT A HAND ON EACH OF ROSY'S THIN SHOULDERS SHE FELT SHARPLY DEFINED BONES AS SHE DID SO AND BENT TO KISS HER IT WAS THE NATURAL AFFECTIONATE EXPRESSION OF HER FEELING BUT TEARS STARTED TO ROSY'S EYES
3906-23193-0028 TURNED RED AGAIN AND SHIFTED IN HIS PLACE OH BETTY WAS ROSY'S FAINT NERVOUS EXCLAMATION YOU SEEM SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO SO STRANGE THAT YOU FRIGHTEN ME BETTY LAUGHED WITH THE SOFTEST POSSIBLE CHEERFULNESS SHAKING HER A LITTLE
3906-23193-0029 I SHALL NOT SEEM STRANGE LONG SHE SAID AFTER I HAVE STAYED WITH YOU A FEW WEEKS IF YOU WILL LET ME STAY WITH YOU LET YOU LET YOU IN A SORT OF GASP POOR LITTLE LADY ANSTRUTHERS SANK ON TO A SETTLE AND BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN
3906-23193-0030 IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE ALWAYS CRIED WHEN THINGS OCCURRED UGHTRED'S SPEECH FROM HIS WINDOW SEAT TESTIFIED AT ONCE TO THAT DON'T CRY MOTHER HE SAID YOU KNOW HOW WE'VE TALKED THAT OVER TOGETHER IT'S HER NERVES HE EXPLAINED TO BETTINA
3906-23193-0031 WE KNOW IT ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE BUT SHE CAN'T STOP IT BETTINA SAT ON THE SETTLE TOO SHE HERSELF WAS NOT THEN AWARE OF THE WONDERFUL FEELING THE POOR LITTLE SPARE FIGURE EXPERIENCED AS HER SOFTLY STRONG YOUNG ARMS CURVED ABOUT IT
3906-23193-0032 SHE WAS ONLY AWARE THAT SHE HERSELF FELT THAT THIS WAS A HEART BREAKING THING AND THAT SHE MUST NOT MUST NOT LET IT BE SEEN HOW MUCH SHE RECOGNISED ITS WOEFULNESS THIS WAS PRETTY FAIR ROSY WHO HAD NEVER DONE A HARM IN HER HAPPY LIFE
3906-23193-0033 THIS FORLORN THING WAS HER ROSY NEVER MIND SHE SAID HALF LAUGHING AGAIN I RATHER WANT TO CRY MYSELF AND I AM STRONGER THAN SHE IS I AM IMMENSELY STRONG YES YES SAID LADY ANSTRUTHERS WIPING HER EYES
3906-23193-0034 AND MAKING A TREMENDOUS EFFORT AT SELF RESPECTING COMPOSURE YOU ARE STRONG I HAVE GROWN SO WEAK IN WELL IN EVERY WAY BETTY I'M AFRAID THIS IS A POOR WELCOME YOU SEE I'M AFRAID YOU'LL FIND IT ALL SO DIFFERENT FROM FROM NEW YORK
3906-23193-0035 I WANTED TO FIND IT DIFFERENT SAID BETTY BUT BUT I MEAN YOU KNOW LADY ANSTRUTHERS TURNED HELPLESSLY TO THE BOY BETTINA WAS STRUCK WITH THE PAINFUL TRUTH THAT SHE LOOKED EVEN SILLY AS SHE TURNED TO HIM UGHTRED
3906-23193-0036 TELL HER SHE ENDED AND HUNG HER HEAD UGHTRED HAD GOT DOWN AT ONCE FROM HIS SEAT AND LIMPED FORWARD HIS UNPREPOSSESSING FACE LOOKED AS IF HE PULLED HIS CHILDISHNESS TOGETHER WITH AN UNCHILDISH EFFORT SHE MEANS HE SAID IN HIS AWKWARD WAY
3906-23193-0037 THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE THE ROOMS ARE ALL SO SHABBY EVERYTHING IS SO SHABBY PERHAPS YOU WON'T STAY WHEN YOU SEE BETTINA PERCEPTIBLY INCREASED THE FIRMNESS OF HER HOLD ON HER SISTER'S BODY
3906-23193-0038 IT WAS AS IF SHE DREW IT NEARER TO HER SIDE IN A KIND OF TAKING POSSESSION SHE KNEW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME WHEN SHE MIGHT GO THIS FAR AT LEAST WITHOUT EXPRESSING ALARMING THINGS YOU CANNOT SHOW ME ANYTHING THAT WILL FRIGHTEN ME WAS THE ANSWER SHE MADE
3906-23193-0039 I HAVE COME TO STAY ROSY WE CAN MAKE THINGS RIGHT IF THEY REQUIRE IT WHY NOT LADY ANSTRUTHERS STARTED A LITTLE AND STARED AT HER SHE KNEW TEN THOUSAND REASONS WHY THINGS HAD NOT BEEN MADE RIGHT
3906-23193-0040 AND THE CASUAL INFERENCE THAT SUCH REASONS COULD BE LIGHTLY SWEPT AWAY AS IF BY THE MERE WAVE OF A HAND IMPLIED A POWER APPERTAINING TO A TIME SEEMING SO LOST FOREVER THAT IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER OH BETTY BETTY SHE CRIED
3906-23193-0041 THE FACT SO SIMPLE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE ABNORMAL CLASS TO WHICH SHE OF A TRUTH BELONGED THE CLASS WHICH HEAPED UP ITS MILLIONS THE ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN THE WORLD AND THAT SHE WAS OF THOSE WHO WERE AMONG ITS CHIEF OWNERS HAD CEASED TO SEEM A FACT
3906-23193-0042 AND HAD VANISHED INTO THE REGION OF FAIRY STORIES
3906-23193-0043 WHICH WAS ALSO A REVELATION OF MANY THINGS THERE WOULD BE UNPLEASING TRUTHS TO BE LEARNED AND SHE HAD NOT MADE HER PILGRIMAGE FOR NOTHING BUT IN ANY EVENT THERE WERE ADVANTAGES WITHOUT DOUBT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH SUBJECTED ONE TO BEING PERPETUALLY POINTED OUT AS A DAUGHTER OF A MULTI MILLIONAIRE
3906-23193-0044 YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN I HAVE NOT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FOR YEARS I HAVE BEEN PLANNING TO COME TO YOU SINCE I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD
