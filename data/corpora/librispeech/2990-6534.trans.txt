2990-6534-0000 WINTER QUARTERS THE LAST DAY OF THE SUN AND A VERY GLORIOUS VIEW OF ITS GOLDEN LIGHT OVER THE BARNE GLACIER
2990-6534-0001 THE FINE ICE CLIFFS OF WHICH WERE IN DEEP SHADOW UNDER THE ROSY RAYS IMPRESSION THE LONG MILD TWILIGHT WHICH LIKE A SILVER CLASP UNITES TO DAY WITH YESTERDAY
2990-6534-0002 WHEN MORNING AND EVENING SIT TOGETHER HAND IN HAND BENEATH THE STARLESS SKY OF MIDNIGHT IT BLEW HARD LAST NIGHT AND MOST OF THE YOUNG ICE HAS GONE AS EXPECTED PATCHES SEEM TO BE REMAINING SOUTH OF THE GLACIER TONGUE
2990-6534-0003 AND THE ISLAND AND OFF OUR OWN BAY IN THIS VERY QUEER SEASON IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE FINAL FREEZING IS TO BE REACHED BY GRADUAL INCREMENTS TO THE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ICE HAD DIVINE SERVICE
2990-6534-0004 BUT IT IS GOOD TO SEE EVERYONE IN SUCH EXCELLENT SPIRITS SO FAR NOT A RIFT IN THE SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS MONDAY APRIL TWENTY FOURTH A NIGHT WATCHMAN HAS BEEN INSTITUTED MAINLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBSERVING THE AURORA
2990-6534-0005 OF WHICH THE DISPLAYS HAVE BEEN FEEBLE SO FAR
2990-6534-0006 THE COCOA CAN BE MADE OVER AN ACETYLENE BUNSEN BURNER PART OF SIMPSON'S OUTFIT
2990-6534-0007 THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERGUARD FOLLOW IN ROTATION THE LONG NIGHT HOURS GIVE TIME TO FINISH UP A NUMBER OF SMALL TASKS THE HUT REMAINS QUITE WARM THOUGH THE FIRES ARE OUT
2990-6534-0008 IT IS FILLED WITH HYDROGEN GAS WHICH IS MADE IN A SPECIAL GENERATOR THE GENERATION IS A SIMPLE PROCESS A VESSEL FILLED WITH WATER HAS AN INVERTED VESSEL WITHIN IT A PIPE IS LED TO THE BALLOON FROM THE LATTER
2990-6534-0009 AND A TUBE OF INDIA RUBBER IS ATTACHED WHICH CONTAINS CALCIUM HYDRATE BY TIPPING THE TUBE THE AMOUNT OF CALCIUM HYDRATE REQUIRED CAN BE POURED INTO THE GENERATOR
2990-6534-0010 AS THE GAS IS MADE IT PASSES INTO THE BALLOON OR IS COLLECTED IN THE INNER VESSEL WHICH ACTS AS A BELL JAR IF THE STOP COCK TO THE BALLOON IS CLOSED
2990-6534-0011 WHICH IS CUNNINGLY WOUND ON CONED BOBBINS FROM WHICH THE BALLOON UNWINDS IT WITHOUT HITCH OR FRICTION AS IT ASCENDS IN ORDER TO SPARE THE SILK ANY JERK AS THE BALLOON IS RELEASED
2990-6534-0012 TWO PIECES OF STRING UNITED WITH A SLOW MATCH CARRY THE STRAIN BETWEEN THE INSTRUMENT AND THE BALLOON UNTIL THE SLOW MATCH IS CONSUMED THE BALLOON TAKES ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO INFLATE
2990-6534-0013 THEORETICALLY IF STRAIN IS PUT ON THE SILK THREAD IT SHOULD BREAK BETWEEN THE INSTRUMENT AND THE BALLOON
2990-6534-0014 CLISSOLD P O EVANS AND CREAN TAKE ANIMALS BESIDES ANTON AND OATES I HAVE HAD TO WARN PEOPLE THAT THEY WILL NOT NECESSARILY LEAD THE PONIES WHICH THEY NOW TEND WILSON IS VERY BUSY MAKING SKETCHES
2990-6534-0015 TUESDAY
2990-6534-0016 IT WAS COMPARATIVELY CALM ALL DAY YESTERDAY AND LAST NIGHT
2990-6534-0017 AS A RESULT THE STRAIT HAS FROZEN OVER AT LAST AND IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE HUT POINT PARTY SHOULD BE WITH US BEFORE VERY LONG IF THE BLIZZARDS HOLD OFF FOR ANOTHER THREE DAYS THE CROSSING SHOULD BE PERFECTLY SAFE
2990-6534-0018 THIS WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE CONTINUAL INTERFERENCE OF FROST SMOKE SINCE OUR RETURN HERE AND ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY AND TO DAY THE SKY AND SEA HAVE BEEN GLORIOUS IN THE AFTERNOON
2990-6534-0019 PONTING HAS TAKEN SOME COLOURED PICTURES BUT THE RESULT IS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY AND THE PLATES ARE MUCH SPOTTED WILSON IS VERY BUSY WITH PENCIL AND BRUSH
2990-6534-0020 ATKINSON IS UNPACKING AND SETTING UP HIS STERILIZERS AND INCUBATORS WRIGHT IS WRESTLING WITH THE ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENTS EVANS IS BUSY SURVEYING THE CAPE AND ITS VICINITY OATES IS REORGANISING THE STABLE
2990-6534-0021 IN FACT EVERYONE IS EXTRAORDINARILY BUSY
2990-6534-0022 BUT I'M RAPIDLY ALTERING MY OPINION WE MAY MISS THE HILL CLIMBING HERE BUT IN EVERY DIRECTION THERE IS ABUNDANCE OF INTEREST
2990-6534-0023 WITH THE SUNSET LIGHTS DEEP SHADOWS THE BLACK ISLANDS AND WHITE BERGS IT WAS ALL VERY BEAUTIFUL SIMPSON AND BOWERS SENT UP A BALLOON TO DAY WITH A DOUBLE THREAD AND INSTRUMENT ATTACHED THE LINE WAS CHECKED AT ABOUT THREE MILES
2990-6534-0024 AND SOON AFTER THE INSTRUMENT WAS SEEN TO DISENGAGE
2990-6534-0025 THEN IT TURNED TO THE SOUTH BUT DID NOT TRAVEL RAPIDLY WHEN TWO MILES OF THREAD HAD GONE IT SEEMED TO BE GOING NORTH AGAIN OR RISING STRAIGHT UPWARD IN THE AFTERNOON SIMPSON AND BOWERS WENT TO RECOVER THEIR TREASURE
2990-6534-0026 BUT SOMEWHERE SOUTH OF INACCESSIBLE ISLAND THEY FOUND THE THREAD BROKEN AND THE LIGHT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO CONTINUE THE SEARCH THE SIDES OF THE GALLEY FIRE HAVE CAVED IN THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHEEKS TO PREVENT THIS
2990-6534-0027 WE GOT SOME FIRE CLAY CEMENT TO DAY AND PLASTERED UP THE SIDES
2990-6534-0028 CALM WENT ROUND CAPE EVANS REMARKABLE EFFECTS OF ICICLES ON THE ICE FOOT FORMED BY SPRAY OF SOUTHERLY GALES
2990-6534-0029 THE FOURTH DAY IN SUCCESSION WITHOUT WIND BUT OVERCAST LIGHT SNOW HAS FALLEN DURING THE DAY TO NIGHT THE WIND COMES FROM THE NORTH
2990-6534-0030 AND THE ICE SHOULD BE GETTING THICKER WITH RAPIDITY WENT ROUND THE BERGS OFF CAPE EVANS THEY ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL ESPECIALLY ONE WHICH IS PIERCED TO FORM A HUGE ARCH
2990-6534-0031 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO CLIMB AROUND THESE MONSTERS AS THE WINTER PROCEEDS TO DAY I HAVE ORGANISED A SERIES OF LECTURES FOR THE WINTER THE PEOPLE SEEM KEEN AND IT OUGHT TO BE EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING TO DISCUSS SO MANY DIVERSE SUBJECTS WITH EXPERTS
2990-6534-0032 THESE ARE REALLY VERY WONDERFUL PONTING TOOK SOME PHOTOGRAPHS WITH LONG EXPOSURE AND WRIGHT GOT SOME VERY FINE ICE CRYSTALS
2990-6534-0033 OVER BLUE ICE THE FAULTS IN THE DUST STRATA IN THESE SURFACES ARE VERY MYSTERIOUS AND SHOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE IN THE EXPLANATION OF CERTAIN ICE PROBLEMS IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE SEA HAD FROZEN OVER FOR GOOD
2990-6534-0034 EARLY TWENTY EIGHTH ICE OVER WHOLE STRAIT TWENTY NINTH ALL ICE GONE THIRTIETH FREEZING OVER MAY FOURTH
2990-6534-0035 BY THE TIME WE STARTED HOMEWARD IT WAS UPON US
2990-6534-0036 THERE IS AN OMINOUS BLACK LOOK TO THE WESTWARD
2990-6534-0037 AS I FEARED LAST NIGHT THE MORNING LIGHT REVEALED THE HAVOC MADE IN THE ICE BY YESTERDAY'S GALE
2990-6534-0038 BUT AFTER CHURCH I WENT UP THE RAMP WITH WILSON AND STEADILY CLIMBED OVER THE GLACIER ICE TO A HEIGHT OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FEET
2990-6534-0039 FROM THIS ELEVATION ONE COULD SEE THAT A BROAD BELT OF SEA ICE HAD BEEN PUSHED BODILY TO SEAWARD AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT LAST NIGHT THE WHOLE STRETCH OF WATER FROM HUT POINT TO TURTLE ISLAND MUST HAVE BEEN OPEN
2990-6534-0040 AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THESE WOULD BE SERIOUS FOR A GOOD WAY FARTHER THE VIEW IS MAGNIFICENT AND ON A CLEAR DAY LIKE THIS ONE STILL ENJOYS SOME HOURS OF DAYLIGHT OR RATHER TWILIGHT
2990-6534-0041 WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE EVERYTHING CLEARLY HAVE HAD TALKS OF THE CURIOUS CONES WHICH ARE SUCH A FEATURE OF THE RAMP
2990-6534-0042 IT WAS CALM YESTERDAY A BALLOON WAS SENT UP IN THE MORNING BUT ONLY REACHED A MILE IN HEIGHT BEFORE THE INSTRUMENT WAS DETACHED BY SLOW MATCH IN THE AFTERNOON WENT OUT WITH BOWERS AND HIS PONY TO PICK UP INSTRUMENT
2990-6534-0043 WENT ON PAST INACCESSIBLE ISLAND THE ICE OUTSIDE THE BERGS HAS GROWN VERY THICK FOURTEEN INCHES OR MORE BUT THERE WERE FRESHLY FROZEN POOLS BEYOND THE ISLAND
2990-6534-0044 IN THE EVENING WILSON OPENED THE LECTURE SERIES WITH A PAPER ON ANTARCTIC FLYING BIRDS CONSIDERING THE LIMITS OF THE SUBJECT THE DISCUSSION WAS INTERESTING THE MOST ATTRACTIVE POINT RAISED WAS THAT OF PIGMENTATION
2990-6534-0045 DOES THE ABSENCE OF PIGMENT SUGGEST ABSENCE OF RESERVE ENERGY DOES IT INCREASE THE INSULATING PROPERTIES OF THE HAIR OR FEATHERS OR DOES THE ANIMAL CLOTHED IN WHITE RADIATE LESS OF HIS INTERNAL HEAT
2990-6534-0046 AMONGST THE GIANT PETRELS FOUND IN HIGH LATITUDES TO DAY HAVE HAD OUR FIRST GAME OF FOOTBALL A HARASSING SOUTHERLY WIND SPRANG UP WHICH HELPED MY OWN SIDE TO THE EXTENT OF THREE GOALS
2990-6534-0047 THIS SAME WIND CAME WITH A CLEAR SKY AND JUMPED UP AND DOWN IN FORCE THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON BUT HAS DIED AWAY TO NIGHT
2990-6534-0048 IN THE AFTERNOON I SAW AN OMINOUS LEAD OUTSIDE THE ISLAND WHICH APPEARED TO EXTEND A LONG WAY SOUTH I'M MUCH AFRAID IT MAY GO ACROSS OUR PONY TRACK FROM HUT POINT I AM GETTING ANXIOUS TO HAVE THE HUT PARTY BACK
2990-6534-0049 AND BEGIN TO WONDER IF THE ICE TO THE SOUTH WILL EVER HOLD IN PERMANENTLY NOW THAT THE GLACIER TONGUE HAS GONE
2990-6534-0050 ANOTHER CALM DAY VERY BEAUTIFUL AND CLEAR
2990-6534-0051 SHOWING HOW TIDE AND WIND SHIFT THE THIN SHEETS THE NEWEST LEADS HELD YOUNG ICE OF FOUR INCHES
2990-6534-0052 IT SHOULD BE MUCH LOWER WITH SUCH CALM WEATHER AND CLEAR SKIES A STRANGE FACT IS NOW VERY COMMONLY NOTICED
2990-6534-0053 BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURE AT THE HUT AND THAT ON WIND VANE HILL SIXTY FOUR FEET THE LATTER BEING THE HIGHER THIS SHOWS AN INVERTED TEMPERATURE AS I RETURNED FROM MY WALK THE SOUTHERN SKY SEEMED TO GROW DARKER
2990-6534-0054 AND LATER STRATUS CLOUD WAS UNDOUBTEDLY SPREADING UP FROM THAT DIRECTION THIS AT ABOUT FIVE P M ABOUT SEVEN A MODERATE NORTH WIND SPRANG UP
2990-6534-0055 HAS GONE OUT AGAIN IN PLACES
2990-6534-0056 IN THE EVENING SIMPSON GAVE US HIS FIRST METEOROLOGICAL LECTURE THE SUBJECT CORONAS HALOS RAINBOWS AND AURORAS
2990-6534-0057 AND TAUGHT ME MORE OF THESE PHENOMENA IN THE HOUR THAN I HAD LEARNT BY ALL PREVIOUS INTERESTED INQUIRIES CONCERNING THEM I NOTE ONE OR TWO POINTS CONCERNING EACH PHENOMENON CORONA
2990-6534-0058 WHITE TO BROWN INSIDE RING CALLED AUREOLA OUTSIDE ARE SOMETIMES SEEN TWO OR THREE RINGS OF PRISMATIC LIGHT IN ADDITION CAUSED BY DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT ROUND DROPS OF WATER OR ICE CRYSTALS
2990-6534-0059 MIXED SIZES OF DITTO CAUSES AUREOLA WITHOUT RINGS HALOS CAUSED BY REFRACTION AND REFLECTION THROUGH AND FROM ICE CRYSTALS
2990-6534-0060 IN THIS CONNECTION THE HEXAGONAL TETRAHEDONAL TYPE OF CRYSTALLISATION IS FIRST TO BE NOTED
2990-6534-0061 THESE FORMS FALLING THROUGH AIR ASSUME DEFINITE POSITION THE PLATE FALLS HORIZONTALLY SWAYING TO AND FRO THE NEEDLE TURNS RAPIDLY ABOUT ITS LONGER AXIS WHICH REMAINS HORIZONTAL SIMPSON SHOWED EXCELLENT EXPERIMENTS TO ILLUSTRATE
2990-6534-0062 CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTS AND REFRACTION OF LIGHT STRIKING CRYSTALS CLEARLY LEADS TO EXPLANATION OF VARIOUS COMPLICATED HALO PHENOMENA SUCH AS RECORDED AND SUCH AS SEEN BY US ON THE GREAT BARRIER
2990-6534-0063 RECORD OF ICE CRYSTALS SEEN ON BARRIER SURFACE RAINBOWS
2990-6534-0064 COLOURS INNER RED OUTSIDE OUTER RED INSIDE
2990-6534-0065 WANTED TO SEE MORE RAINBOWS ON BARRIER
2990-6534-0066 REPORTS SHOULD NOTE COLOURS AND RELATIVE WIDTH OF BANDS OF COLOUR IRIDESCENT CLOUDS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD OBSERVATIONS REQUIRED
2990-6534-0067 AURORAS CLEARLY MOST FREQUENT AND INTENSE IN YEARS OF MAXIMUM SUN SPOTS THIS ARGUES CONNECTION WITH THE SUN POINTS NOTICED REQUIRING CONFIRMATION ARCH CENTRE OF ARCH IN MAGNETIC MERIDIAN
2990-6534-0068 SHAFTS TAKE DIRECTION OF DIPPING NEEDLE BANDS AND CURTAINS WITH CONVOLUTIONS NOT UNDERSTOOD CORONA SHAFTS MEETING TO FORM NOTES REQUIRED ON MOVEMENT AND DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT COLOURS SEEN
2990-6534-0069 AND VICE VERSA IN GENERAL SIGNIFICANT SIGNS OF SOME CONNECTION POSSIBLE COMMON DEPENDENTS ON A THIRD FACTOR
2990-6534-0070 AND THAT OF A HEAVY GAS ARGON MAY BE COINCIDENCE TWO THEORIES ENUNCIATED ARRHENIUS BOMBARDMENTS OF MINUTE CHARGED PARTICLES FROM THE SUN GATHERED INTO THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH
2990-6534-0071 IT IS EXPERIMENTALLY SHOWN THAT MINUTE DROPS OF WATER ARE DEFLECTED BY LIGHT IT IS EXPERIMENTALLY SHOWN THAT IONS ARE GIVEN OFF BY DRIED CALCIUM WHICH THE SUN CONTAINS
2990-6534-0072 WITH LINES OF MAGNETIC FORCE
2990-6534-0073 THE SEA WAS FROZEN BUT AFTER TWELVE HOURS CALM IT WOULD BE IN ANY CASE THE DARK APPEARANCE OF THE ICE IS NOTICEABLE BUT THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE OF LATE SINCE THE LIGHT IS POOR
