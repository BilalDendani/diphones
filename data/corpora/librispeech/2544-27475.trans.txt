2544-27475-0010 STARING AND SMILING ALL OVER HER FACE THE MOMENT SHE SAW ME NOW SHE WAS A GROWN WOMAN AND A SWEET LOOKING ONE TOO I COULDN'T LIFT HER UP AND KISS HER AS I USED TO DO
2544-27475-0011 SHE WAS THE ONLY CREATURE IN THE WHOLE WORLD I THINK THAT LIKED ME BETTER THAN JIM I'D BEEN TRYING TO DRIVE ALL THOUGHTS OF HER OUT OF MY HEART SEEING THE TANGLE I'D GOT INTO IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
2544-27475-0012 STRONGER THAN EVER I WAS SURPRISED AT MYSELF AND LOOKED QUEER I DARESAY THEN AILEEN LAUGHED AND JIM COMES TO THE RESCUE AND SAYS DICK DOESN'T REMEMBER YOU GRACEY YOU'VE GROWN SUCH A SWELL TOO
2544-27475-0013 YOU CAN'T BE THE LITTLE GIRL WE USED TO CARRY ON OUR BACKS DICK REMEMBERS VERY WELL SHE SAYS AND HER VERY VOICE WAS EVER SO MUCH FULLER AND SOFTER DON'T YOU DICK AND SHE LOOKED INTO MY FACE AS INNOCENT AS A CHILD

2544-27475-0015 I SEE GEORGE COMING SO I MUST GO AND FETCH IN DINNER
2544-27475-0016 WHEN GEORGE CAME IN HE BEGAN TO TALK TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AND TOLD US WHERE HE HAD BEEN A LONG WAY OUT IN SOME NEW BACK COUNTRY JUST TAKEN UP WITH SHEEP HE HAD GOT A FIRST RATE PAYING PRICE FOR HIS CARRIAGE OUT
2544-27475-0017 I CAN BREED AND FEED A GOOD STAMP OF DRAUGHT HORSE HERE I PAY DRIVERS FOR THREE WAGGONS AND DRIVE THE FOURTH MYSELF IT PAYS FIRST RATE SO FAR AND WE HAD VERY FAIR FEED ALL THE WAY THERE AND BACK
2544-27475-0018 WE SHALL HAVE TO CARRY FORAGE OF COURSE
2544-27475-0019 SO YOU'VE RIDDEN OVER TO SHOW THEM THE WAY AILEEN HE SAID AS THE GIRLS CAME IN VERY GOOD OF YOU IT WAS
2544-27475-0020 I NEVER FORGET THE WAY TO A FRIEND'S PLACE GEORGE SHE SAID
2544-27475-0021 BUT YOU'VE BEEN AWAY YOURSELF
2544-27475-0022 THAT WILL BE A GOOD DAY FOR ALL OF US SHE SAID YOU KNOW GRACEY WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT GEORGE CAN WE I FELT QUITE DESERTED I CAN TELL YOU
2544-27475-0023 IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT OH I COULDN'T INTERFERE WITH MISTER STOREFIELD'S BUSINESS SAID AILEEN LOOKING VERY GRAVE WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY WAS IT YOU WERE OUT IN
2544-27475-0024 NOT A BAD PLACE FOR SHEEP AND CATTLE AND BLACKS SAID POOR GEORGE LOOKING RATHER GLUM AND NOT A BAD COUNTRY TO MAKE MONEY OR DO ANYTHING BUT LIVE IN
2544-27475-0025 BUT THAT HOT AND DRY AND FULL OF FLIES AND MOSQUITOES THAT I'D SOONER LIVE ON A POUND A WEEK DOWN HERE THAN TAKE A GOOD STATION AS A PRESENT THERE
2544-27475-0026 IT'S RIGHT ENOUGH IF SHE'S MADE UP HER MIND TO TAKE HIM NO ODDS WHAT HAPPENS BUT IF THERE'S ANY HALF AND HALF FEELING IN HER MIND ABOUT HIM AND SHE'S UNCERTAIN AND DOUBTFUL WHETHER SHE LIKES HIM WELL ENOUGH ALL THIS DOWN ON YOUR KNEES BUSINESS WORKS AGAINST YOU
2544-27475-0027 I'VE FOUND IT OUT SINCE WORSE LUCK AND I REALLY BELIEVE IF GEORGE HAD HAD THE SAVEY TO CRACK HIMSELF UP A LITTLE AND SAY HE'D MET A NICE GIRL OR TWO IN THE BACK COUNTRY AND HID HIS HAND
2544-27475-0028 AILEEN WOULD HAVE MADE IT UP WITH HIM THAT VERY CHRISTMAS AND BEEN A HAPPY WOMAN ALL HER LIFE
2544-27475-0029 WHERE WE'D BEEN WHAT WE'D DONE WHAT TOOK US TO MELBOURNE HOW WE LIKED IT WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE THEY WERE AND SO ON WE HAD TO TELL HER A GOOD LOT PART OF IT TRUTH OF COURSE BUT PRETTY MIXED
2544-27475-0030 WERE THERE ANY DAUGHTERS IN THE FAMILY JIM ASKED GRACE OH YES THREE WERE THEY GOOD LOOKING NO RATHER HOMELY PARTICULARLY THE YOUNGEST WHAT DID THEY DO
2544-27475-0031 I DON'T THINK I EVER KNEW JIM DO SO MUCH LYING BEFORE BUT AFTER HE'D BEGUN HE HAD TO STICK TO IT HE TOLD ME AFTERWARDS HE NEARLY BROKE DOWN ABOUT THE THREE DAUGHTERS
2544-27475-0032 SAYS HE THAT'S WHY SHE MADE ME TELL ALL THOSE CRAMMERS IT'S AN AWFUL PITY WE CAN'T ALL SQUARE IT AND GET SPLICED THIS CHRISTMAS AILEEN WOULD TAKE GEORGE IF SHE WASN'T A FOOL AS MOST WOMEN ARE
2544-27475-0033 AND HOW ABOUT KATE
2544-27475-0034 I WISH YOU'D NEVER DROPPED ACROSS HER AND THAT SHE WASN'T JEANIE'S SISTER BLURTS OUT JIM
2544-27475-0035 I FEEL AS SURE AS WE'RE STANDING HERE IT'S ALL A TOSS UP LIKE OUR LIVES MARRIED OR LAGGED BUSHWORK OR ROADWORK IN IRONS FREE OR BOND WE CAN'T TELL HOW IT WILL BE WITH US THIS DAY YEAR
2544-27475-0036 I'VE HALF A MIND TO SHOOT MYSELF SAYS JIM AND END IT ALL I WOULD TOO ONLY FOR MOTHER AND AILEEN WHAT'S THE USE OF LIFE THAT ISN'T LIFE BUT FEAR AND MISERY FROM ONE DAY'S END TO ANOTHER AND WE ONLY JUST GROWN UP
2544-27475-0037 WE DIDN'T RIDE HOME TILL QUITE THE EVENING GRACE WOULD HAVE US STAY FOR TEA IT WAS A PRETTY HOT DAY SO THERE WAS NO USE RIDING IN THE SUN GEORGE SADDLED HIS HORSE AND HE AND GRACE RODE PART OF THE WAY HOME WITH US
2544-27475-0038 HE'D GOT REGULAR SUNBURNT LIKE US
2544-27475-0039 HE LOOKED BETTER OUTSIDE OF A HORSE THAN ON HIS OWN LEGS BEING RATHER THICK SET AND SHORTISH BUT HIS HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE LIKE HIS SISTER'S AND HIS HEAD WAS SCREWED ON RIGHT TOO I THINK MORE OF OLD GEORGE NOW THAN I EVER DID BEFORE
2544-27475-0040 AND WISH I'D HAD THE SENSE TO VALUE HIS INDEPENDENT STRAIGHT AHEAD NATURE AND THE TRACK IT LED HIM AS HE DESERVED JIM AND I RODE IN FRONT WITH GRACEY BETWEEN US SHE HAD ON A NEAT HABIT AND A BETTER HAT AND GLOVES THAN AILEEN
2544-27475-0041 TALKING ABOUT THE PLACES I'D BEEN TO AND SHE WANTING TO KNOW EVERYTHING JIM DREW OFF A BIT WHEN THE ROAD GOT NARROW
2544-27475-0042 I FELT WHAT A FOOL I'D BEEN TO LET THINGS SLIDE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY RIGHT HAND TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT THEM AS THEY WERE THREE SHORT YEARS BEFORE AT LAST WE GOT TO THE GAP IT WAS THE SHORTEST HALT FROM THEIR HOME
2544-27475-0043 GEORGE SHOOK HANDS WITH AILEEN AND TURNED BACK WE'LL COME AND SEE YOU NEXT HE SAID CHRISTMAS EVE SAID AILEEN CHRISTMAS EVE LET IT BE SAYS GEORGE
