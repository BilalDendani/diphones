4179-25937-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR WARDROP'S STORY I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE NIGHT MISS JANE DISAPPEARED AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT HAS DRIVEN ME DESPERATE
4179-25937-0001 WILL YOU TELL ME WHY I SHOULD BE SUSPECTED OF HAVING A HAND IN THAT WHEN SHE HAD BEEN A MOTHER TO ME IF SHE IS DEAD SHE CAN'T EXONERATE ME IF SHE IS LIVING AND WE FIND HER SHE WILL TELL YOU WHAT I TELL YOU THAT I KNOW NOTHING OF THE WHOLE TERRIBLE BUSINESS
4179-25937-0002 I AM QUITE CERTAIN OF THAT WARDROP I INTERPOSED BESIDES I THINK I HAVE GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT MYSTERY MARGERY LOOKED AT ME QUICKLY BUT I SHOOK MY HEAD IT WAS TOO EARLY TO TELL MY SUSPICIONS
4179-25937-0003 THE THINGS THAT LOOKED BLACK AGAINST ME WERE BAD ENOUGH BUT THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MISS JANE I WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO BEFORE THE NIGHT SHE WENT AWAY
4179-25937-0004 BUTLER WAS NOT A BUSINESS MAN HE LET TOO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY LIE WITH HIS SUBORDINATES AND THEN ACCORDING TO THE STORY HE COULDN'T DO MUCH ANYHOW AGAINST SCHWARTZ
4179-25937-0005 THE CASHIER WAS ENTIRELY UNDER MACHINE CONTROL AND BUTLER WAS NEGLECTFUL YOU REMEMBER KNOX THE CRASH WHEN THREE BANKS ROTTEN TO THE CORE WENT UNDER AND IT WAS FOUND A LARGE AMOUNT OF STATE MONEY HAD GONE TOO
4179-25937-0006 IT WAS FLEMING WHO DID IT I AM SORRY MARGERY BUT THIS IS NO TIME TO MINCE WORDS IT WAS FLEMING WHO DEPOSITED THE MONEY IN THE WRECKED BANKS KNOWING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN THE CRASH CAME
4179-25937-0007 BUTLER'S SURETIES TO SAVE THEMSELVES CONFISCATED EVERY DOLLAR HE HAD IN THE WORLD BUTLER WENT TO THE PENITENTIARY FOR SIX MONTHS ON SOME MINOR COUNT AND WHEN HE GOT OUT AFTER WRITING TO FLEMING AND SCHWARTZ PROTESTING HIS INNOCENCE
4179-25937-0008 AND ASKING FOR ENOUGH OUT OF THE FORTUNE THEY HAD ROBBED HIM OF TO SUPPORT HIS WIFE HE KILLED HIMSELF AT THE WHITE CAT MARGERY WAS VERY PALE BUT QUIET SHE SAT WITH HER FINGERS LOCKED IN HER LAP AND HER EYES ON WARDROP
4179-25937-0009 IT WAS A BAD BUSINESS WARDROP WENT ON WEARILY FLEMING MOVED INTO BUTLER'S PLACE AS TREASURER AND TOOK LIGHTFOOT AS HIS CASHIER THAT KEPT THE LID ON ONCE OR TWICE WHEN THERE WAS AN UNEXPECTED CALL FOR FUNDS
4179-25937-0010 THE TREASURY WAS ALMOST EMPTY AND SCHWARTZ CARRIED THINGS OVER HIMSELF I WENT TO PLATTSBURG AS MISTER FLEMING'S PRIVATE SECRETARY WHEN HE BECAME TREASURER AND FROM THE FIRST I KNEW THINGS WERE EVEN WORSE THAN THE AVERAGE STATE GOVERNMENT
4179-25937-0011 SCHWARTZ AND FLEMING HAD TO HOLD TOGETHER THEY HATED EACH OTHER AND THE FEELING WAS TREBLED WHEN FLEMING MARRIED SCHWARTZ'S DIVORCED WIFE MARGERY LOOKED AT ME WITH STARTLED INCREDULOUS EYES
4179-25937-0012 WHAT SHE MUST HAVE SEEN CONFIRMED WARDROP'S WORDS AND SHE LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR LIMP AND UNNERVED BUT SHE HEARD AND COMPREHENDED EVERY WORD WARDROP WAS SAYING THE WOMAN WAS A VERY ORDINARY PERSON BUT IT SEEMS SCHWARTZ CARED FOR HER
4179-25937-0013 ABOUT A YEAR AGO MISTER FLEMING SAID ANOTHER ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE ON HIS LIFE WITH POISON HE WAS VERY MUCH ALARMED AND I NOTICED A CHANGE IN HIM FROM THAT TIME ON THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL AT THE TREASURY
4179-25937-0014 SCHWARTZ AND HIS CROWD WERE MAKING DEMANDS THAT WERE HARD TO SUPPLY AND
4179-25937-0015 HE EMPLOYED A MAN TO PROTECT HIM A MAN NAMED CARTER WHO HAD BEEN A BARTENDER IN PLATTSBURG WHEN THINGS BEGAN TO HAPPEN HERE IN MANCHESTER HE TOOK CARTER TO THE HOME AS A BUTLER THEN THE BOROUGH BANK GOT SHAKY
4179-25937-0016 IF IT WENT DOWN THERE WOULD BE AN UGLY SCANDAL AND FLEMING WOULD GO TOO HIS NOTES FOR HALF A MILLION WERE THERE WITHOUT SECURITY AND HE DARED NOT SHOW THE CANCELED NOTES HE HAD WITH SCHWARTZ'S INDORSEMENT
4179-25937-0017 HE STOPPED HIS NERVOUS PACING AND STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT HER I WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY A GIRL WHO WAS EVERYTHING ON EARTH TO ME AND I WAS PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE STATE TREASURER
4179-25937-0018 WITH THE PRINCELY SALARY OF SUCH A POSITION MISTER FLEMING CAME BACK HERE WHEN THE BOROUGH BANK THREATENED FAILURE AND TRIED TO GET MONEY ENOUGH TO TIDE OVER THE TROUBLE
4179-25937-0019 AND BUTLER WAS INNOCENT HE RAISED A LITTLE MONEY HERE AND I WENT TO PLATTSBURG WITH SECURITIES AND LETTERS
4179-25937-0020 I BROUGHT BACK ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A PACKAGE IN MY RUSSIA LEATHER BAG AND I HAD SOMETHING ELSE HE WAVERED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS RECITAL HE WENT ON MORE RAPIDLY
4179-25937-0021 AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT EITHER OF US I CARRIED NOT IN THE VALISE A BUNDLE OF LETTERS FIVE IN ALL WHICH HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY HENRY BUTLER TO MISTER FLEMING LETTERS THAT SHOWED WHAT A DUPE BUTLER HAD BEEN THAT HE HAD BEEN NEGLIGENT BUT NOT CRIMINAL ACCUSING FLEMING OF HAVING RUINED HIM
4179-25937-0022 THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT WERE YOU GOING TO SELL THE LETTERS MARGERY DEMANDED WITH QUICK SCORN I INTENDED TO BUT I DIDN'T IT WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO DIRTY AFTER ALL
4179-25937-0023 AS I CAME UP FROM THE TRAIN THE NIGHT I GOT HERE FROM PLATTSBURG SHE HAD OFFERED TO BUY THE LETTERS AND I HAD BROUGHT THEM TO SELL TO HER AND THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE I LIED I SAID I COULDN'T GET THEM THAT THEY WERE LOCKED IN THE MONMOUTH AVENUE HOUSE
4179-25937-0024 I PUT HER IN A TAXICAB THAT SHE HAD WAITING AND SHE WENT BACK TO TOWN
4179-25937-0025 WELL MISTER FLEMING WAS YOUR FATHER MARGERY I COULDN'T HURT YOU LIKE THAT DO YOU THINK MISSUS BUTLER TOOK YOUR LEATHER BAG I ASKED I DO NOT THINK SO
4179-25937-0026 MY HAND WAS CRAMPED FROM HOLDING IT WHEN SHE GAVE UP IN DESPAIR AT LAST AND WENT BACK TO THE CITY WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE LETTERS SHE WANTED I KEPT THEM WITH ME THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING HID THEM IN THE SECRET CLOSET THAT WAS WHEN I DROPPED MY FOUNTAIN PEN
4179-25937-0027 AND THE PEARLS MARGERY ASKED SUDDENLY WHEN DID YOU GET THEM HARRY TO MY SURPRISE HIS FACE DID NOT CHANGE HE APPEARED TO BE THINKING TWO DAYS BEFORE I LEFT HE SAID
4179-25937-0028 WE WERE USING EVERY METHOD TO GET MONEY AND YOUR FATHER SAID TO SACRIFICE THEM IF NECESSARY MY FATHER
4179-25937-0029 DID YOU THINK I STOLE THEM HE DEMANDED AND I CONFESS THAT I WAS ASHAMED TO SAY I HAD THOUGHT PRECISELY THAT YOUR FATHER GAVE ME NINE UNMOUNTED PEARLS TO SELL HE REITERATED
4179-25937-0030 MARGERY LOOKED AT ME I THINK SHE WAS FAIRLY STUNNED TO LEARN THAT HER FATHER HAD MARRIED AGAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN THE KEYSTONE IN AN ARCH OF VILLAINY THAT WITH HIM GONE WAS NOW ABOUT TO FALL AND TO ASSOCIATE HIM WITH SO SMALL AND MEAN A THING
4179-25937-0031 HE THOUGHT WHAT YOU ALL THOUGHT WARDROP SAID BITTERLY HE ACCUSED ME OF STEALING THE MONEY I FELT WORSE THAN A THIEF HE WAS DESPERATE AND I TOOK HIS REVOLVER FROM HIM
4179-25937-0032 BUT WHEN I SUGGESTED THAT SHE WAIT FOR THE REST OF THE STORY SHE REFUSED VEHEMENTLY I CAME BACK HERE TO BELLWOOD AND THE FIRST THING I LEARNED WAS ABOUT MISS JANE WHEN I SAW THE BLOOD PRINT ON THE STAIR RAIL
4179-25937-0033 I THOUGHT SHE WAS MURDERED AND I HAD MORE THAN I COULD STAND I TOOK THE LETTERS OUT OF THE SECRET CLOSET BEFORE I COULD SHOW IT TO YOU AND HUNTER AND LATER I PUT THEM IN THE LEATHER BAG I GAVE YOU AND LOCKED IT
4179-25937-0034 YOU HAVE IT HAVEN'T YOU KNOX I NODDED AS FOR THAT NIGHT AT THE CLUB
4179-25937-0035 NOT ALL THE TRUTH I SUPPOSE I AM A COWARD BUT I WAS AFRAID TO IF YOU KNEW SCHWARTZ YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND WITH THE MEMORY OF HIS HUGE FIGURE AND THE HEAVY UNDER SHOT FACE THAT I HAD SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
4179-25937-0036 I COULD UNDERSTAND VERY WELL KNOWING WARDROP I WENT TO THAT ROOM AT THE WHITE CAT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID NOT TO GO FLEMING MIGHT KILL HIMSELF OR SOME ONE ELSE I WENT UP THE STAIRS SLOWLY AND I HEARD NO SHOT
4179-25937-0037 AT THE DOOR I HESITATED THEN OPENED IT QUIETLY THE DOOR INTO THE BUILT IN STAIRCASE WAS JUST CLOSING IT MUST HAVE TAKEN ME ONLY AN INSTANT TO REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED FLEMING WAS SWAYING FORWARD AS I CAUGHT HIM
4179-25937-0038 I JUMPED TO THE STAIRCASE AND LOOKED DOWN BUT I WAS TOO LATE THE DOOR BELOW HAD CLOSED I KNEW IN ANOTHER MINUTE WHO HAD BEEN THERE AND ESCAPED IT WAS RAINING YOU REMEMBER AND SCHWARTZ HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE HIS UMBRELLA
4179-25937-0039 WITH HIS NAME ON THE HANDLE SCHWARTZ
4179-25937-0040 HE DEMANDED I HAVE BEEN UNDER SURVEILLANCE EVERY MINUTE SINCE THAT NIGHT THERE'S PROBABLY SOME ONE HANGING AROUND THE GATE NOW ANYHOW I WAS
4179-25937-0041 I HARDLY REMEMBER WHAT I DID
4179-25937-0042 TOOK THE UMBRELLA WITH ME AND LEFT IT IN THE VESTIBULE OF THE FIRST HOUSE I SAW WITH A DOCTOR'S SIGN I RANG THE BELL LIKE A CRAZY MAN AND THEN HUNTER CAME ALONG AND SAID TO GO BACK DOCTOR GRAY WAS AT THE CLUB THAT IS ALL I KNOW
4179-25937-0043 I'M NOT PROUD OF IT MARGERY
4179-25937-0044 IT CLEARS UP SOMETHING BUT NOT ALL IT DOESN'T TELL WHERE AUNT JANE IS OR WHO HAS THE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT IT DOES SHOW WHO KILLED YOUR FATHER
4179-25937-0045 AND IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU KNOX YOU WILL LET IT GO AT THAT YOU CAN'T FIGHT THE POLICE AND THE COURTS SINGLE HANDED LOOK HOW THE WHOLE THING WAS DROPPED AND THE MOST COLD BLOODED KIND OF MURDER TURNED INTO SUICIDE SUICIDE WITHOUT A WEAPON
4179-25937-0046 I AM NOT SO SURE ABOUT SCHWARTZ I SAID THOUGHTFULLY
