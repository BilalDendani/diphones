3070-166421-0000 AS WE BREAKFASTED I APPROACHED DIRECTLY THAT MATTER WHICH MY GROWING LIKING FOR HIM WAS TURNING INTO STRONG DESIRE DRAKE I ASKED WHERE ARE YOU GOING
3070-166421-0001 HE LAUGHED I'M FOOT LOOSE AND FANCY FREE
3070-166421-0002 HE MIGHT GET AWAY THE IDEA SEEMED TO APPALL HIM FINE I EXCLAIMED HEARTILY AND THRUST OUT MY HAND TO HIM I'M THINKING OF STRIKING OVER THE RANGE SOON TO THE MANASAROWAR LAKES THERE'S A CURIOUS FLORA I'D LIKE TO STUDY
3070-166421-0003 MILE AFTER MILE WE TRUDGED THROUGH THE BLUE POPPIES DISCUSSING THE ENIGMAS OF THE TWILIGHT AND OF THE NIGHT IN THE LIGHT OF DAY THEIR BREATH OF VAGUE TERROR WAS DISSIPATED THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR MYSTERY NOR DREAD UNDER THIS FLOOR OF BRILLIANT SUNSHINE
3070-166421-0004 THE SMILING SAPPHIRE FLOOR ROLLED EVER ON BEFORE US WHISPERING LITTLE PLAYFUL BREEZES FLEW DOWN THE SLOPES TO GOSSIP FOR A MOMENT WITH THE NODDING FLOWERS
3070-166421-0005 AN ATMOSPHERE SO UNIQUE AS TO MAKE ALMOST ANYTHING OF THE KIND POSSIBLE BUT DRAKE WAS NOT CONVINCED I KNOW HE SAID
3070-166421-0006 I ADMIT IT'S ALL POSSIBLE I'LL EVEN ADMIT IT'S ALL PROBABLE BUT DAMN ME DOC IF I BELIEVE IT I HAD TOO CLEARLY THE FEELING OF A CONSCIOUS FORCE
3070-166421-0007 THE WESTERN MOUNT WAS CLOSE THE MOUTH OF THE GORGE THROUGH WHICH WE MUST PASS NOW PLAIN BEFORE US IT DID NOT SEEM AS THOUGH WE COULD REACH IT BEFORE DUSK AND DRAKE AND I WERE RECONCILED TO SPENDING ANOTHER NIGHT IN THE PEACEFUL VALE PLODDING ALONG DEEP IN THOUGHT
3070-166421-0008 I WAS STARTLED BY HIS EXCLAMATION HE WAS STARING AT A POINT SOME HUNDRED YARDS TO HIS RIGHT I FOLLOWED HIS GAZE THE TOWERING CLIFFS WERE A SCANT HALF MILE AWAY
3070-166421-0009 AT SOME DISTANT TIME THERE HAD BEEN AN ENORMOUS FALL OF ROCK THIS DISINTEGRATING HAD FORMED A GENTLY CURVING BREAST WHICH SLOPED DOWN TO MERGE WITH THE VALLEY'S FLOOR WILLOW AND WITCH ALDER STUNTED BIRCH AND POPLAR HAD FOUND ROOTHOLD CLOTHED IT
3070-166421-0010 UNTIL ONLY THEIR CROWDING OUTPOSTS
3070-166421-0011 A RECTANGLE ALL OF THIRTY FEET WIDE TWO HUNDRED LONG THE HEEL FAINTLY CURVED AND FROM ITS HITHER END LIKE CLAWS
3070-166421-0012 IRRESISTIBLY WAS IT LIKE A FOOTPRINT BUT WHAT THING WAS THERE WHOSE TREAD COULD LEAVE SUCH A PRINT AS THIS I RAN UP THE SLOPE DRAKE ALREADY WELL IN ADVANCE I PAUSED AT THE BASE OF THE TRIANGLES WHERE
3070-166421-0013 AS THOUGH BY THE STROKE OF A SCIMITAR
3070-166421-0014 BENT DOWN AND STARED IN UTTER DISBELIEF OF WHAT MY OWN EYES BEHELD FOR STONE AND EARTH HAD BEEN CRUSHED COMPRESSED INTO A SMOOTH MICROSCOPICALLY GRAINED
3070-166421-0015 OF THE WEIRD GLOW THAT HAD FLASHED ABOUT US WHEN THE MIST AROSE TO HIDE THE CHAINED AURORA IT WAS WHAT WE HEARD I SAID THE SOUNDS IT WAS THEN THAT THIS WAS MADE
3070-166421-0016 AGAIN I INTERPRETED DRAKE CAST A CALCULATING GLANCE UP TO THE CLIFF TOP TWO THOUSAND FEET ABOUT HE MUSED
3070-166421-0017 THE LENGTH OF THIS THING WOULD GIVE HIM JUST ABOUT A TWO THOUSAND FOOT LEG YES HE COULD JUST ABOUT STRADDLE THAT HILL YOU'RE SURELY NOT SERIOUS I ASKED IN CONSTERNATION
3070-166421-0018 A SIGIL A SEAL BUT WHY I ASKED WHAT COULD BE THE PURPOSE BETTER ASK WHERE THE DEVIL SUCH A FORCE COULD BE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND HOW IT CAME HERE HE SAID
3070-166421-0019 I PEERED ABOUT IT WAS SO EXCEPT FOR THE MARK THERE WAS NO SLIGHTEST SIGN OF THE UNUSUAL THE ABNORMAL BUT THE MARK WAS ENOUGH
3070-166421-0020 I'M FOR PUSHING UP A NOTCH OR TWO AND GETTING INTO THE GORGE BEFORE DARK HE WAS VOICING MY OWN THOUGHT I'M WILLING TO FACE ANYTHING HUMAN
3070-166421-0021 JUST AT TWILIGHT WE DREW OUT OF THE VALLEY INTO THE PASS WE TRAVELED A FULL MILE ALONG IT BEFORE DARKNESS FORCED US TO MAKE CAMP THE GORGE WAS NARROW THE FAR WALLS BUT A HUNDRED FEET AWAY BUT WE HAD NO QUARREL WITH THEM FOR THEIR NEIGHBORLINESS
3070-166421-0022 WE DINED WITHIN ON BREAD AND TEA AND THEN TIRED TO THE BONE SOUGHT EACH HIS PLACE UPON THE ROCKY FLOOR I SLEPT WELL WAKING ONLY ONCE OR TWICE BY CHIU MING'S GROANINGS HIS DREAMS EVIDENTLY WERE NONE OF THE PLEASANTEST
