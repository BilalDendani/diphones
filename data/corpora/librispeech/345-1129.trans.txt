345-1129-0000 THE NEXT DAY OPENED A NEW SCENE AT LONGBOURN MISTER COLLINS MADE HIS DECLARATION IN FORM HAVING RESOLVED TO DO IT WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME AS HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY
345-1129-0001 AND HAVING NO FEELINGS OF DIFFIDENCE TO MAKE IT DISTRESSING TO HIMSELF EVEN AT THE MOMENT HE SET ABOUT IT IN A VERY ORDERLY MANNER WITH ALL THE OBSERVANCES WHICH HE SUPPOSED A REGULAR PART OF THE BUSINESS ON FINDING MISSUS BENNET ELIZABETH
345-1129-0002 AND ONE OF THE YOUNGER GIRLS TOGETHER SOON AFTER BREAKFAST HE ADDRESSED THE MOTHER IN THESE WORDS MAY I HOPE MADAM FOR YOUR INTEREST WITH YOUR FAIR DAUGHTER ELIZABETH WHEN I SOLICIT FOR THE HONOUR OF A PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH HER IN THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING
345-1129-0003 BEFORE ELIZABETH HAD TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT A BLUSH OF SURPRISE MISSUS BENNET ANSWERED INSTANTLY OH DEAR YES CERTAINLY I AM SURE LIZZY WILL BE VERY HAPPY I AM SURE SHE CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION COME KITTY

345-1129-0006 ELIZABETH WOULD NOT OPPOSE SUCH AN INJUNCTION AND A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION MAKING HER ALSO SENSIBLE THAT IT WOULD BE WISEST TO GET IT OVER AS SOON AND AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND TRIED TO CONCEAL
345-1129-0007 BY INCESSANT EMPLOYMENT THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN DISTRESS AND DIVERSION MISSUS BENNET AND KITTY WALKED OFF AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE MISTER COLLINS BEGAN BELIEVE ME MY DEAR MISS ELIZABETH
345-1129-0008 THAT I HAVE YOUR RESPECTED MOTHER'S PERMISSION FOR THIS ADDRESS YOU CAN HARDLY DOUBT THE PURPORT OF MY DISCOURSE HOWEVER YOUR NATURAL DELICACY MAY LEAD YOU TO DISSEMBLE MY ATTENTIONS HAVE BEEN TOO MARKED TO BE MISTAKEN
345-1129-0009 ALMOST AS SOON AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE I SINGLED YOU OUT AS THE COMPANION OF MY FUTURE LIFE
345-1129-0010 PERHAPS IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE FOR ME TO STATE MY REASONS FOR MARRYING AND MOREOVER FOR COMING INTO HERTFORDSHIRE WITH THE DESIGN OF SELECTING A WIFE AS I CERTAINLY DID THE IDEA OF MISTER COLLINS WITH ALL HIS SOLEMN COMPOSURE
345-1129-0011 LIKE MYSELF TO SET THE EXAMPLE OF MATRIMONY IN HIS PARISH SECONDLY THAT I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WILL ADD VERY GREATLY TO MY HAPPINESS AND THIRDLY WHICH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER
345-1129-0012 THAT IT IS THE PARTICULAR ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE VERY NOBLE LADY WHOM I HAVE THE HONOUR OF CALLING PATRONESS TWICE HAS SHE CONDESCENDED TO GIVE ME HER OPINION
345-1129-0013 ON THIS SUBJECT AND IT WAS BUT THE VERY SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE I LEFT HUNSFORD BETWEEN OUR POOLS AT QUADRILLE WHILE MISSUS JENKINSON WAS ARRANGING MISS DE BOURGH'S FOOTSTOOL THAT SHE SAID MISTER COLLINS YOU MUST MARRY
345-1129-0014 BUT ABLE TO MAKE A SMALL INCOME GO A GOOD WAY THIS IS MY ADVICE FIND SUCH A WOMAN AS SOON AS YOU CAN BRING HER TO HUNSFORD AND I WILL VISIT HER ALLOW ME BY THE WAY TO OBSERVE MY FAIR COUSIN
345-1129-0015 THAT I DO NOT RECKON THE NOTICE AND KINDNESS OF LADY CATHERINE DE BOURGH AS AMONG THE LEAST OF THE ADVANTAGES IN MY POWER TO OFFER YOU WILL FIND HER MANNERS BEYOND ANYTHING I CAN DESCRIBE AND YOUR WIT AND VIVACITY I THINK MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO HER
345-1129-0016 ESPECIALLY WHEN TEMPERED WITH THE SILENCE AND RESPECT WHICH HER RANK WILL INEVITABLY EXCITE THUS MUCH FOR MY GENERAL INTENTION IN FAVOUR OF MATRIMONY IT REMAINS TO BE TOLD WHY MY VIEWS WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS LONGBOURN INSTEAD OF MY OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
345-1129-0017 WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE ARE MANY AMIABLE YOUNG WOMEN BUT THE FACT IS THAT BEING AS I AM TO INHERIT THIS ESTATE AFTER THE DEATH OF YOUR HONOURED FATHER WHO HOWEVER MAY LIVE MANY YEARS LONGER
345-1129-0018 THIS HAS BEEN MY MOTIVE MY FAIR COUSIN AND I FLATTER MYSELF IT WILL NOT SINK ME IN YOUR ESTEEM AND NOW NOTHING REMAINS FOR ME BUT TO ASSURE YOU IN THE MOST ANIMATED LANGUAGE OF THE VIOLENCE OF MY AFFECTION TO FORTUNE I AM PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT
345-1129-0019 SINCE I AM WELL AWARE THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPLIED WITH AND THAT ONE THOUSAND POUNDS IN THE FOUR PER CENTS WHICH WILL NOT BE YOURS TILL AFTER YOUR MOTHER'S DECEASE IS ALL THAT YOU MAY EVER BE ENTITLED TO
345-1129-0020 ON THAT HEAD THEREFORE I SHALL BE UNIFORMLY SILENT AND YOU MAY ASSURE YOURSELF THAT NO UNGENEROUS REPROACH SHALL EVER PASS MY LIPS WHEN WE ARE MARRIED IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO INTERRUPT HIM NOW

345-1129-0022 BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO OTHERWISE THAN TO DECLINE THEM I AM NOT NOW TO LEARN REPLIED MISTER COLLINS WITH A FORMAL WAVE OF THE HAND THAT IT IS USUAL WITH YOUNG LADIES TO REJECT THE ADDRESSES OF THE MAN
345-1129-0023 WHOM THEY SECRETLY MEAN TO ACCEPT WHEN HE FIRST APPLIES FOR THEIR FAVOUR AND THAT SOMETIMES THE REFUSAL IS REPEATED A SECOND OR EVEN A THIRD TIME I AM THEREFORE BY NO MEANS DISCOURAGED BY WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID

345-1129-0026 WERE YOUR FRIEND LADY CATHERINE TO KNOW ME I AM PERSUADED SHE WOULD FIND ME IN EVERY RESPECT ILL QUALIFIED FOR THE SITUATION WERE IT CERTAIN THAT LADY CATHERINE WOULD THINK SO SAID MISTER COLLINS VERY GRAVELY
345-1129-0027 AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN WHEN I HAVE THE HONOUR OF SEEING HER AGAIN I SHALL SPEAK IN THE VERY HIGHEST TERMS OF YOUR MODESTY ECONOMY AND OTHER AMIABLE QUALIFICATION INDEED MISTER COLLINS ALL PRAISE OF ME WILL BE UNNECESSARY YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO JUDGE FOR MYSELF

345-1129-0029 AND MAY TAKE POSSESSION OF LONGBOURN ESTATE WHENEVER IT FALLS WITHOUT ANY SELF REPROACH THIS MATTER MAY BE CONSIDERED THEREFORE AS FINALLY SETTLED AND RISING AS SHE THUS SPOKE SHE WOULD HAVE QUITTED THE ROOM HAD MISTER COLLINS NOT THUS ADDRESSED HER
345-1129-0030 WHEN I DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF SPEAKING TO YOU NEXT ON THE SUBJECT I SHALL HOPE TO RECEIVE A MORE FAVOURABLE ANSWER THAN YOU HAVE NOW GIVEN ME THOUGH I AM FAR FROM ACCUSING YOU OF CRUELTY AT PRESENT
345-1129-0031 ON THE FIRST APPLICATION AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE EVEN NOW SAID AS MUCH TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT AS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TRUE DELICACY OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER REALLY MISTER COLLINS CRIED ELIZABETH WITH SOME WARMTH YOU PUZZLE ME EXCEEDINGLY
345-1129-0032 IF WHAT I HAVE HITHERTO SAID CAN APPEAR TO YOU IN THE FORM OF ENCOURAGEMENT I KNOW NOT HOW TO EXPRESS MY REFUSAL IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ITS BEING ONE YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO FLATTER MYSELF MY DEAR COUSIN THAT YOUR REFUSAL OF MY ADDRESSES IS MERELY WORDS OF COURSE
345-1129-0033 MY REASONS FOR BELIEVING IT ARE BRIEFLY THESE IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT MY HAND IS UNWORTHY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT I CAN OFFER WOULD BE ANY OTHER THAN HIGHLY DESIRABLE
345-1129-0034 MY CONNECTIONS WITH THE FAMILY OF DE BOURGH AND MY RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR OWN ARE CIRCUMSTANCES HIGHLY IN MY FAVOUR AND YOU SHOULD TAKE IT INTO FURTHER CONSIDERATION THAT IN SPITE OF YOUR MANIFOLD ATTRACTIONS
345-1129-0035 IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT ANOTHER OFFER OF MARRIAGE MAY EVER BE MADE YOU YOUR PORTION IS UNHAPPILY SO SMALL THAT IT WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD UNDO THE EFFECTS OF YOUR LOVELINESS AND AMIABLE QUALIFICATIONS
345-1129-0036 I SHALL CHOOSE TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO YOUR WISH OF INCREASING MY LOVE BY SUSPENSE ACCORDING TO THE USUAL PRACTICE OF ELEGANT FEMALES I DO ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS WHATEVER TO THAT KIND OF ELEGANCE WHICH CONSISTS IN TORMENTING A RESPECTABLE MAN
345-1129-0037 I WOULD RATHER BE PAID THE COMPLIMENT OF BEING BELIEVED SINCERE I THANK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR THE HONOUR YOU HAVE DONE ME IN YOUR PROPOSALS BUT TO ACCEPT THEM IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE MY FEELINGS IN EVERY RESPECT FORBID IT CAN I SPEAK PLAINER
345-1129-0038 DO NOT CONSIDER ME NOW AS AN ELEGANT FEMALE INTENDING TO PLAGUE YOU BUT AS A RATIONAL CREATURE SPEAKING THE TRUTH FROM HER HEART YOU ARE UNIFORMLY CHARMING CRIED HE WITH AN AIR OF AWKWARD GALLANTRY
345-1129-0039 AND I AM PERSUADED THAT WHEN SANCTIONED BY THE EXPRESS AUTHORITY OF BOTH YOUR EXCELLENT PARENTS MY PROPOSALS WILL NOT FAIL OF BEING ACCEPTABLE TO SUCH PERSEVERANCE IN WILFUL SELF DECEPTION ELIZABETH WOULD MAKE NO REPLY
345-1129-0040 AND IMMEDIATELY AND IN SILENCE WITHDREW DETERMINED IF HE PERSISTED IN CONSIDERING HER REPEATED REFUSALS AS FLATTERING ENCOURAGEMENT TO APPLY TO HER FATHER WHOSE NEGATIVE MIGHT BE UTTERED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE DECISIVE
