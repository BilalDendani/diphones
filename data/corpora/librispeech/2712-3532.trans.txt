2712-3532-0000 BUT SHE DID LOVE GOD WITH ALL HER HEART AND HER NEIGHBOR AS HERSELF THIS SIMPLE COUNTRY GIRL YOUNG AND STRONG YET SO TENDER HEARTED AND FORGETFUL OF SELF APPEARS TO ME SOMETIMES LIKE ONE OF THE CLEAR BROOKS OF MY BELOVED LAND PURE AND FRESH
2712-3532-0001 SLIPPING NOISELESSLY BETWEEN FLOWERED BANKS OF FORGET ME NOTS IT WAS BY LOVE THAT SHE CONQUERED AS WE SHALL SEE IF SOME DAY YOU SHOULD COME TO MY COUNTRY DO NOT FORGET THAT I WOULD HAVE GREAT JOY IN SEEING ANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE READ THIS BOOK
2712-3532-0002 WHERE ON EVERY SIDE THERE ARE HILLS AND MOUNTAINS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN REACH TO ME IT IS THE LOVELIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND I AM SURE THAT PAULA THOUGHT SO TOO
2712-3532-0003 I MUST NOT KEEP YOU ANY LONGER FOR I AM SURE YOU HAVE A GREAT DESIRE TO KNOW ABOUT PAULA AND ANYWAY I SUPPOSE YOU WILL HAVE DONE WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE AT YOUR AGE NAMELY READ THE STORY FIRST
2712-3532-0004 FOR WHICH I HAVE ALREADY PARDONED YOU AND NOW MAY GOD BLESS YOU PAULA DEAR AS YOU WALK AMONG THESE MY YOUNG FRIENDS WHO READ ABOUT YOU MY PRAYER IS THAT YOU MAY SHED OVER THEM THE SAME SWEET RAY OF CELESTIAL LIGHT
2712-3532-0005 THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SHED OVER OTHERS EVA LECOMTE
2712-3532-0006 TRANSLATOR'S NOTE PAULA WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN FRENCH AND TRANSLATED FROM THENCE INTO SPANISH AND THE PRESENT TRANSLATOR HAVING DISCOVERED THIS LITERARY AND SPIRITUAL JEWEL
2712-3532-0007 FELT THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN ALSO TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD NOT ONLY THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW PAULA HERSELF BUT THAT THROUGH HER THEY MIGHT BECOME MORE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH PAULA'S SAVIOUR
2712-3532-0008 CLEARLY ENGRAVED ON THE WALLS OF MY MEMORY THERE STILL REMAINS A PICTURE OF THE GREAT GRAY HOUSE WHERE I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD IT WAS ORIGINALLY USED FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AS THE CONVENT OF THE WHITE LADIES WITH ITS FOUR LONG GALLERIES
2712-3532-0009 ONE ABOVE THE OTHER LOOKING PROUDLY DOWN UPON THE HUMBLER DWELLINGS OF THE VILLAGE
2712-3532-0010 WHERE RAN THE BROAD ROAD FROM ROUEN TO DARNETAL A HIGH RUGGED WALL SURROUNDED A WIDE YARD GUARDED AT THE ENTRANCE BY TWO MASSIVE DOORS STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS SPIKES THE NAKED BARRENNESS OF THIS YARD WAS TO SAY THE LEAST
2712-3532-0011 FORBIDDING IN THE EXTREME BUT THE FERTILE FIELDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE SPREAD THEMSELVES LIKE A VAST AND BEAUTIFUL GREEN CARPET DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH LITTLE VILLAGES CROWNED WITH CHURCH SPIRES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING BELFRIES
2712-3532-0012 FROM WHICH ON A SUNDAY MORNING PEALED OUT THE CHEERFUL CALL TO PRAYER AND WORSHIP THE ANCIENT CONVENT LONG BEFORE OUR STORY BEGINS HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A LOVELY DWELLING WITH AN IMMENSE GARDEN ON ONE SIDE
2712-3532-0013 EDGED BY A DOZEN LITTLE BRICK HOUSES THAT SEEMED
2712-3532-0014 THAT WE USED TO SEE IN THE PARIS MAGAZINES THEY WERE KNOWN LOCALLY AS THE RED COTTAGES A LONG AVENUE OF ANCIENT ELMS SEPARATED US FROM THESE HOUSES OF OUR NEIGHBORS
2712-3532-0015 WHERE IN THE SHADE OF THE GREAT TREES THE OLD MEN OF THE VILLAGE USED TO SIT AND RECOUNT TO US TALES OF THE DAYS WHEN THE CONVENT FLOURISHED SOME OF THESE STORIES MADE US SHIVER INDEED THEY HAD A HABIT OF STRAYING INTO OUR DREAMS AT NIGHT
2712-3532-0016 THE REST OF THE LAND AROUND THE CONVENT HAD
2712-3532-0017 FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE VILLAGERS THEMSELVES EACH ONE HAD A SMALL SPACE FOR FLOWERS IN FRONT AND A VEGETABLE GARDEN BEHIND OF COURSE
2712-3532-0018 WAS A MUCH MORE PRETENTIOUS AFFAIR WITH ITS DEEP WELL
2712-3532-0019 AND ITS NOISY BEE HIVES IN FACT IT WAS IN OUR EYES THE MOST ENCHANTING CORNER OF THE EARTH I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT THE SPECIAL THING THAT HAPPENED ONE DAY BUT I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT TO THE END OF MY LIFE
2712-3532-0020 WE WERE AT TEA IN THE GARDEN TERESA OUR OLD SERVANT WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN IN HER KITCHEN SHE NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN TO EAT DEAR OLD TERESA SHE ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE A MOTHER TO ME
2712-3532-0021 FOR WE HAD LOST OUR OWN DEAR MOTHER WHEN I WAS STILL IN THE CRADLE MY BROTHER AND I HAD QUARRELLED OVER A MERE NOTHING WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO TEA BY OUR FATHER OF COURSE WE DID NOT DARE CONTINUE OUR DISPUTE OPENLY IN FRONT OF HIM
2712-3532-0022 BUT WE CONTINUED OUR WAR LIKE ACTIVITIES BY KICKING EACH OTHER UNDER THE TABLE LOUIS WAS TEN YEARS OLD AND I WAS NINE AS HE WAS OLDER AND A BOY
2712-3532-0023 HE OF COURSE CONSIDERED THAT HE HAD THE RIGHT TO THE LAST WORD NOW KICKS HAD REPLACED WORDS BUT AS WE WERE SEATED AT QUITE A DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER
2712-3532-0024 NOTWITHSTANDING THIS
2712-3532-0025 KNOWING THAT LOUIS WAS NOT VERY COURAGEOUS I LEANED MY CHAIR AS FAR INSIDE AS I COULD AND LET HIM HAVE ONE TERRIFIC KICK AT THIS HIS FACE CHANGED COLOR AND MY FATHER NOW DISTURBED BY THE EXTRA NOISE OF MY KICK
2712-3532-0026 FINALLY BEGAN TO REALIZE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
2712-3532-0027 IF TERESA HAD NOT AT THIS MOMENT COME INTO THE GARDEN WITH A BLACK BORDERED LETTER IN HER HAND WHICH SHE DELIVERED TO OUR FATHER HE TOOK IT SILENTLY AND OPENED IT AS TERESA CARRIED AWAY THE TEA POT
2712-3532-0028 AND I AM SURE LOUIS NOTICED IT ALSO FOR HE COMPLETELY FORGOT TO RETURN MY KICK
2712-3532-0029 CALLED MY FATHER ALL RIGHT I'M COMING SAID THAT GOOD LADY READ THIS AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT AND MY FATHER HANDED THE LETTER TO THE OLD SERVANT TERESA SEATED HERSELF AT THE END OF THE TABLE BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
2712-3532-0030 AND WITH HER HEAD IN HER HAND COMMENCED TO READ TERESA WAS NOT VERY WELL EDUCATED
2712-3532-0031 WHO WROTE THIS WAS HER FIRST QUESTION THE PASTOR OF THE VILLAGE REPLIED MY FATHER A MINISTER EXCLAIMED TERESA HE'S A MIGHTY POOR WRITER FOR A MINISTER AND NO DOUBT HIS MOTHER PAID MIGHTY WELL FOR HIS
2712-3532-0032 EDUCATION MY FATHER SMILED A BIT SADLY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT TERESA YES YES I UNDERSTAND HALF OF IT AND I THINK I CAN GUESS AT THE OTHER HALF DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU OFFERED LOUIS
2712-3532-0033 TERESA LOOKED SCORNFULLY AT LOUIS YOU I SHOULD SAY NOT YOU DON'T CARE TO HELP ME IN THE KITCHEN OR RUN ERRANDS FOR ME AND THE ONLY THING THE MATTER WITH YOU NOW IS CURIOSITY THAT SETTLED LOUIS AND TERESA WENT ON WITH HER READING
2712-3532-0034 BENDING HER GREAT FAT FORM MORE AND MORE CLOSELY OVER THE LETTER SHE BECAME MORE SERIOUS AS SHE NEARED THE BOTTOM OF THE FOURTH PAGE WHERE THE WRITING BECAME SO CLOSE AND SO FINE THAT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO DECIPHER IT
2712-3532-0035 WHEN AT LAST SHE LIFTED HER HEAD HER EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS POOR POOR LITTLE THING SHE REPEATED SOFTLY WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK SAID MY FATHER WHAT DO I THINK
2712-3532-0036 WHO MY FATHER INTERRUPTED HER WITHOUT CEREMONY
2712-3532-0037 TELL US FATHER PLEASE ADDED MY SISTER ROSA A TALL SERIOUS GIRL OF FIFTEEN
2712-3532-0038 PATIENCE PATIENCE CRIED MY FATHER YOUR TURN WILL COME TERESA YOU ARE GETTING OLD AND ANOTHER GIRL IN THE HOUSE SIMPLY MEANS MORE WORK FOR YOU AND A LOT MORE PROBLEMS FOR ME IF SHE
2712-3532-0039 MY FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RECONCILE HIMSELF TO PRONOUNCE THE NAME OF MY MOTHER SINCE HER UNTIMELY DEATH IF
2712-3532-0040 I WOULD NOT HESITATE BUT TO BRING ANOTHER ORPHAN INTO A FAMILY ALREADY HALF ORPHANED DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME DON'T WORRY SIR A LITTLE MORE WORK DOESN'T WORRY TERESA ROULAND

2712-3532-0042 ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO REFLECT LONG ABOUT DOING GOOD WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHY I HESITATE I'M SURE THAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD MUCH BETTER REPLACE THE PARENTS OF THIS ORPHANED GIRL I MUST CONFESS THAT FOR MY PART I DON'T FEEL EQUAL TO THE TASK
2712-3532-0043 SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I THINK YOU HAVE SAID TO YOURSELF FROM THE TIME THAT MY WIFE DIED LIFE HAS BECOME A BURDEN AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THE CHILDREN I WOULD HAVE DIED OF GRIEF BUT FOR LOVE OF THEM I MUST WORK AND LIVE
2712-3532-0044 THEREFORE WITH MY HEART TORN AND DESOLATED AS IT IS I DON'T FEEL CALLED UPON TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY UPON MYSELF OTHER THAN THAT OF MY OWN CHILDREN THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY TERESA YES SIR
2712-3532-0045 BUT IT IS VERY BAD VERY BAD IF YOU WILL LET ME SAY SO I KNOW I OUGHT NOT TO TALK SO AS I'M ONLY A POOR OLD SERVANT BUT REMEMBER I WAS THE ONE THAT BROUGHT UP THE LOVELY WOMAN THAT WE ALL MOURN FOR
2712-3532-0046 AND I KNEW HER BEFORE YOU DID SIR AND I LOVED HER AS IF SHE WERE MY OWN CHILD WHEN I PUT HER IN THE COFFIN IT WAS AS IF THEY HAD TAKEN OUT A PIECE OF MY OWN HEART SHE WAS SO YOUNG TO DIE SO SWEET SO GOOD

2712-3532-0048 AND I SAID TO MYSELF THAT I WOULD HONOR THE MEMORY OF MY MISTRESS BY DOING ALWAYS THAT WHICH I KNEW SHE WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF AND NOW SIR TAKE THIS LITTLE ORPHAN AS YOU KNOW YOUR GOOD WIFE WOULD HAVE DONE
2712-3532-0049 AS THE DAUGHTER OF HER BELOVED SISTER SHE STOPPED SUDDENLY SLIGHTLY ABASHED AS SHE REALIZED THAT PERHAPS SHE HAD SAID A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR ONE IN HER STATION IN LIFE BUT MORE THAN HER MERE WORDS HER VOICE
2712-3532-0050 VIBRANT WITH EMOTION HAD MOVED US ALL TO THE DEPTHS OF OUR SOULS YOU ARE A VALIANT WOMAN WITH A GREAT HEART MY FATHER SAID AS HE TOOK HER HAND I WILL WRITE THIS VERY NIGHT AND ASK THEM TO SEND THE GIRL TO US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
