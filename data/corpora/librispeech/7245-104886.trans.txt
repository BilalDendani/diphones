7245-104886-0000 THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH THE FIRST VOLUME OF EMILY DICKINSON'S POEMS HAS BEEN READ SHOWS VERY CLEARLY THAT ALL OUR ALLEGED MODERN ARTIFICIALITY DOES NOT PREVENT A PROMPT APPRECIATION OF THE QUALITIES OF DIRECTNESS AND SIMPLICITY IN APPROACHING THE GREATEST THEMES
7245-104886-0001 LIFE AND LOVE AND DEATH THAT IRRESISTIBLE NEEDLE TOUCH AS ONE OF HER BEST CRITICS HAS CALLED IT PIERCING AT ONCE THE VERY CORE OF A THOUGHT HAS FOUND A RESPONSE AS WIDE AND SYMPATHETIC AS IT HAS BEEN UNEXPECTED EVEN TO THOSE WHO KNEW BEST HER COMPELLING POWER
7245-104886-0002 THIS SECOND VOLUME WHILE OPEN TO THE SAME CRITICISM AS TO FORM WITH ITS PREDECESSOR SHOWS ALSO THE SAME SHINING BEAUTIES ALTHOUGH EMILY DICKINSON HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SENDING OCCASIONAL POEMS TO FRIENDS AND CORRESPONDENTS
7245-104886-0003 THE FULL EXTENT OF HER WRITING WAS BY NO MEANS IMAGINED BY THEM HER FRIEND H H MUST AT LEAST HAVE SUSPECTED IT FOR IN A LETTER DATED FIFTH SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR SHE WROTE MY DEAR FRIEND
7245-104886-0004 IT IS A CRUEL WRONG TO YOUR DAY AND GENERATION THAT YOU WILL NOT GIVE THEM LIGHT IF SUCH A THING SHOULD HAPPEN AS THAT I SHOULD OUTLIVE YOU I WISH YOU WOULD MAKE ME YOUR LITERARY LEGATEE AND EXECUTOR SURELY AFTER YOU ARE WHAT IS CALLED DEAD
7245-104886-0005 YOU OUGHT TO BE I DO NOT THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM THE WORLD A WORD OR A THOUGHT ANY MORE THAN A DEED WHICH MIGHT HELP A SINGLE SOUL TRULY YOURS HELEN JACKSON
7245-104886-0006 THE PORTFOLIOS WERE FOUND SHORTLY AFTER EMILY DICKINSON'S DEATH BY HER SISTER AND ONLY SURVIVING HOUSEMATE MOST OF THE POEMS HAD BEEN CAREFULLY COPIED ON SHEETS OF NOTE PAPER AND TIED IN LITTLE FASCICULES EACH OF SIX OR EIGHT SHEETS
7245-104886-0007 WHILE MANY OF THEM BEAR EVIDENCE OF HAVING BEEN THROWN OFF AT WHITE HEAT STILL MORE HAD RECEIVED THOUGHTFUL REVISION THERE IS THE FREQUENT ADDITION OF RATHER PERPLEXING FOOT NOTES AFFORDING LARGE CHOICE OF WORDS AND PHRASES
7245-104886-0008 WITHOUT IMPORTANT EXCEPTION HER FRIENDS HAVE GENEROUSLY PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE EDITORS ANY POEMS THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM HER AND THESE HAVE GIVEN THE OBVIOUS ADVANTAGE OF COMPARISON AMONG SEVERAL RENDERINGS OF THE SAME VERSE
7245-104886-0009 IN A LETTER TO ONE OF THE PRESENT EDITORS THE APRIL FOLLOWING SHE SAYS I MADE NO VERSE BUT ONE OR TWO UNTIL THIS WINTER THE HANDWRITING WAS AT FIRST SOMEWHAT LIKE THE DELICATE RUNNING ITALIAN HAND OF OUR ELDER GENTLEWOMEN
7245-104886-0010 BUT AS SHE ADVANCED IN BREADTH OF THOUGHT IT GREW BOLDER AND MORE ABRUPT UNTIL IN HER LATEST YEARS EACH LETTER STOOD DISTINCT AND SEPARATE FROM ITS FELLOWS IN MOST OF HER POEMS PARTICULARLY THE LATER ONES EVERYTHING BY WAY OF PUNCTUATION WAS DISCARDED EXCEPT NUMEROUS DASHES
7245-104886-0011 AND ALL IMPORTANT WORDS BEGAN WITH CAPITALS THE EFFECT OF A PAGE OF HER MORE RECENT MANUSCRIPT IS EXCEEDINGLY QUAINT AND STRONG THE FAC SIMILE GIVEN IN THE PRESENT VOLUME IS FROM ONE OF THE EARLIER TRANSITION PERIODS
7245-104886-0012 ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOWHERE A DATE THE HANDWRITING MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ARRANGE THE POEMS WITH GENERAL CHRONOLOGIC ACCURACY AS A RULE THE VERSES WERE WITHOUT TITLES BUT A COUNTRY BURIAL A THUNDER STORM THE HUMMING BIRD AND A FEW OTHERS WERE NAMED BY THEIR AUTHOR FREQUENTLY AT THE END
7245-104886-0013 LIKE IMPRESSIONIST PICTURES OR WAGNER'S RUGGED MUSIC THE VERY ABSENCE OF CONVENTIONAL FORM CHALLENGES ATTENTION IN EMILY DICKINSON'S EXACTING HANDS THE ESPECIAL INTRINSIC FITNESS OF A PARTICULAR ORDER OF WORDS
7245-104886-0014 AND HER VERSES ALL SHOW A STRANGE CADENCE OF INNER RHYTHMICAL MUSIC LINES ARE ALWAYS DARINGLY CONSTRUCTED AND THE THOUGHT RHYME APPEARS FREQUENTLY APPEALING INDEED TO AN UNRECOGNIZED SENSE MORE ELUSIVE THAN HEARING
7245-104886-0015 EMILY DICKINSON SCRUTINIZED EVERYTHING WITH CLEAR EYED FRANKNESS EVERY SUBJECT WAS PROPER GROUND FOR LEGITIMATE STUDY EVEN THE SOMBRE FACTS OF DEATH AND BURIAL AND THE UNKNOWN LIFE BEYOND SHE TOUCHES THESE THEMES SOMETIMES LIGHTLY SOMETIMES ALMOST HUMOROUSLY
7245-104886-0016 MORE OFTEN WITH WEIRD AND PECULIAR POWER BUT SHE IS NEVER BY ANY CHANCE FRIVOLOUS OR TRIVIAL AND WHILE AS ONE CRITIC HAS SAID SHE MAY EXHIBIT TOWARD GOD AN EMERSONIAN SELF POSSESSION IT WAS BECAUSE SHE LOOKED UPON ALL LIFE WITH A CANDOR AS UNPREJUDICED AS IT IS RARE
7245-104886-0017 SHE HAD TRIED SOCIETY AND THE WORLD AND FOUND THEM LACKING SHE WAS NOT AN INVALID AND SHE LIVED IN SECLUSION FROM NO LOVE DISAPPOINTMENT HER LIFE WAS THE NORMAL BLOSSOMING OF A NATURE INTROSPECTIVE TO A HIGH DEGREE WHOSE BEST THOUGHT COULD NOT EXIST IN PRETENCE
7245-104886-0018 STORM WIND THE WILD MARCH SKY SUNSETS AND DAWNS THE BIRDS AND BEES BUTTERFLIES AND FLOWERS OF HER GARDEN WITH A FEW TRUSTED HUMAN FRIENDS WERE SUFFICIENT COMPANIONSHIP
7245-104886-0019 THE COMING OF THE FIRST ROBIN WAS A JUBILEE BEYOND CROWNING OF MONARCH OR BIRTHDAY OF POPE THE FIRST RED LEAF HURRYING THROUGH THE ALTERED AIR AN EPOCH IMMORTALITY WAS CLOSE ABOUT HER AND WHILE NEVER MORBID OR MELANCHOLY SHE LIVED IN ITS PRESENCE
