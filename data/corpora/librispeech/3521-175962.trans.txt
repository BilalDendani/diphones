3521-175962-0011 NOR IN THE AFFAIR OF THE NOSE UPON FRANCIS THE NINTH NOR IN THE CHARACTER OF MY UNCLE TOBY OF CHARACTERIZING THE MILITIATING SPIRITS OF MY COUNTRY THE WOUND UPON HIS GROIN IS A WOUND TO EVERY COMPARISON OF THAT KIND NOR BY TRIM THAT I MEANT THE DUKE OF ORMOND
3521-175962-0012 OR THAT MY BOOK IS WROTE AGAINST PREDESTINATION OR FREE WILL OR TAXES
3521-175962-0013 IN ORDER BY A MORE FREQUENT AND A MORE CONVULSIVE ELEVATION AND DEPRESSION OF THE DIAPHRAGM AND THE SUCCUSSATIONS OF THE INTERCOSTAL AND ABDOMINAL MUSCLES IN LAUGHTER TO DRIVE THE GALL AND OTHER BITTER JUICES FROM THE GALL BLADDER LIVER AND SWEET BREAD OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
3521-175962-0014 WE WANT MISTER SHANDY TO DIVE INTO THE BOTTOM OF THIS DOUBT WHETHER THE NAME CAN BE CHANGED OR NOT AND AS THE BEARDS OF SO MANY COMMISSARIES OFFICIALS ADVOCATES PROCTORS REGISTERS AND OF THE MOST EMINENT OF OUR SCHOOL DIVINES AND OTHERS ARE ALL TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE TABLE
3521-175962-0015 AND DIDIUS HAS SO PRESSINGLY INVITED YOU WHO IN YOUR DISTRESS WOULD MISS SUCH AN OCCASION ALL THAT IS REQUISITE CONTINUED YORICK IS TO APPRIZE DIDIUS AND LET HIM MANAGE A CONVERSATION AFTER DINNER SO AS TO INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT
3521-175962-0016 THEN MY BROTHER TOBY CRIED MY FATHER CLAPPING HIS TWO HANDS TOGETHER SHALL GO WITH US LET MY OLD TYE WIG QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY AND MY LACED REGIMENTALS BE HUNG TO THE FIRE ALL NIGHT TRIM PAGE NUMBERING SKIPS TEN PAGES
3521-175962-0017 NO DOUBT SIR THERE IS A WHOLE CHAPTER WANTING HERE AND A CHASM OF TEN PAGES MADE IN THE BOOK BY IT BUT THE BOOK BINDER IS NEITHER A FOOL OR A KNAVE OR A PUPPY NOR IS THE BOOK A JOT MORE IMPERFECT AT LEAST UPON THAT SCORE
3521-175962-0018 I QUESTION FIRST BY THE BYE WHETHER THE SAME EXPERIMENT MIGHT NOT BE MADE AS SUCCESSFULLY UPON SUNDRY OTHER CHAPTERS BUT THERE IS NO END AN PLEASE YOUR REVERENCES IN TRYING EXPERIMENTS UPON CHAPTERS WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT SO THERE'S AN END OF THAT MATTER
3521-175962-0019 WE'LL GO IN THE COACH SAID MY FATHER PRITHEE HAVE THE ARMS BEEN ALTERED OBADIAH
3521-175962-0020 OR WHETHER TWAS MORE FROM THE BLUNDER OF HIS HEAD THAN HAND OR WHETHER LASTLY IT WAS FROM THE SINISTER TURN WHICH EVERY THING RELATING TO OUR FAMILY WAS APT TO TAKE IT SO FELL OUT HOWEVER TO OUR REPROACH THAT INSTEAD OF THE BEND DEXTER WHICH SINCE HARRY THE EIGHTH'S REIGN WAS HONESTLY OUR DUE
3521-175962-0021 A BEND SINISTER BY SOME OF THESE FATALITIES HAD BEEN DRAWN QUITE ACROSS THE FIELD OF THE SHANDY ARMS TIS SCARCE CREDIBLE THAT THE MIND OF SO WISE A MAN AS MY FATHER WAS COULD BE SO MUCH INCOMMODED WITH SO SMALL A MATTER THE WORD COACH LET IT BE WHOSE IT WOULD
3521-175962-0022 OR COACH MAN OR COACH HORSE OR COACH HIRE COULD NEVER BE NAMED IN THE FAMILY BUT HE CONSTANTLY COMPLAINED OF CARRYING THIS VILE MARK OF ILLEGITIMACY UPON THE DOOR OF HIS OWN HE NEVER ONCE WAS ABLE TO STEP INTO THE COACH OR OUT OF IT WITHOUT TURNING ROUND TO TAKE A VIEW OF THE ARMS
3521-175962-0023 AND MAKING A VOW AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT WAS THE LAST TIME HE WOULD EVER SET HIS FOOT IN IT AGAIN TILL THE BEND SINISTER WAS TAKEN OUT BUT LIKE THE AFFAIR OF THE HINGE IT WAS ONE OF THE MANY THINGS WHICH THE DESTINIES HAD SET DOWN IN THEIR BOOKS EVER TO BE GRUMBLED AT AND IN WISER FAMILIES THAN OURS BUT NEVER TO BE MENDED
3521-175962-0024 HAS THE BEND SINISTER BEEN BRUSH'D OUT I SAY SAID MY FATHER THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING BRUSH'D OUT SIR ANSWERED OBADIAH BUT THE LINING WE'LL GO O'HORSEBACK SAID MY FATHER TURNING TO YORICK
3521-175962-0025 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD EXCEPT POLITICKS THE CLERGY KNOW THE LEAST OF HERALDRY SAID YORICK NO MATTER FOR THAT CRIED MY FATHER I SHOULD BE SORRY TO APPEAR WITH A BLOT IN MY ESCUTCHEON BEFORE THEM NEVER MIND THE BEND SINISTER SAID MY UNCLE TOBY PUTTING ON HIS TYE WIG
3521-175962-0026 NO INDEED SAID MY FATHER YOU MAY GO WITH MY AUNT DINAH TO A VISITATION WITH A BEND SINISTER IF YOU THINK FIT MY POOR UNCLE TOBY BLUSH'D MY FATHER WAS VEXED AT HIMSELF NO MY DEAR BROTHER TOBY SAID MY FATHER CHANGING HIS TONE
3521-175962-0027 BUT THE DAMP OF THE COACH LINING ABOUT MY LOINS MAY GIVE ME THE SCIATICA AGAIN AS IT DID DECEMBER JANUARY AND FEBRUARY LAST WINTER SO IF YOU PLEASE YOU SHALL RIDE MY WIFE'S PAD
3521-175962-0028 NOW THE CHAPTER I WAS OBLIGED TO TEAR OUT WAS THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS CAVALCADE IN WHICH CORPORAL TRIM AND OBADIAH UPON TWO COACH HORSES A BREAST LED THE WAY AS SLOW AS A PATROLE
3521-175962-0029 WHILST MY UNCLE TOBY IN HIS LACED REGIMENTALS AND TYE WIG KEPT HIS RANK WITH MY FATHER IN DEEP ROADS AND DISSERTATIONS ALTERNATELY UPON THE ADVANTAGE OF LEARNING AND ARMS AS EACH COULD GET THE START
3521-175962-0030 FOR MY OWN PART I AM BUT JUST SET UP IN THE BUSINESS SO KNOW LITTLE ABOUT IT BUT IN MY OPINION TO WRITE A BOOK IS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE HUMMING A SONG BE BUT IN TUNE WITH YOURSELF MADAM TIS NO MATTER HOW HIGH OR HOW LOW YOU TAKE IT
3521-175962-0031 THIS IS THE REASON MAY IT PLEASE YOUR REVERENCES THAT SOME OF THE LOWEST AND FLATTEST COMPOSITIONS PASS OFF VERY WELL AS YORICK TOLD MY UNCLE TOBY ONE NIGHT BY SIEGE MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKED BRISK AT THE SOUND OF THE WORD SIEGE BUT COULD MAKE NEITHER HEAD OR TAIL OF IT
3521-175962-0032 I'M TO PREACH AT COURT NEXT SUNDAY SAID HOMENAS RUN OVER MY NOTES SO I HUMM'D OVER DOCTOR HOMENAS'S NOTES THE MODULATION'S VERY WELL
3521-175962-0033 BUT THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN UP STARTED AN AIR IN THE MIDDLE OF IT SO FINE SO RICH SO HEAVENLY IT CARRIED MY SOUL UP WITH IT INTO THE OTHER WORLD
3521-175962-0034 THAT BY THE FIRST NOTE I HUMM'D I FOUND MYSELF FLYING INTO THE OTHER WORLD AND FROM THENCE DISCOVERED THE VALE FROM WHENCE I CAME SO DEEP SO LOW AND DISMAL THAT I SHALL NEVER HAVE THE HEART TO DESCEND INTO IT AGAIN
