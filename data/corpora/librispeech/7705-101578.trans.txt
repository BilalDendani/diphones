7705-101578-0000 THAT SOUNDED ALL RIGHT AS FAR AS IT WENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT GO FAR THE BOYS WINKED AT ONE ANOTHER GRAVELY BEHIND HIS BACK AND JERKED THEIR THUMBS KNOWINGLY TOWARD MILK RIVER
7705-101578-0001 BY WHICH PANTOMIME THEY REMINDED ONE ANOTHER QUITE UNNECESSARILY THAT MONA STEVENS HAD COME HOME HOWEVER THEY KEPT THEIR SKEPTICISM FROM BECOMING OBTRUSIVE SO THAT THURSTON BELIEVED HIS EXCUSES PASSED ON THEIR FACE VALUE
7705-101578-0002 AND TO ASK HER FOR THE FOURTH TIME IF SHE WILL RECONSIDER HER FORMER DECISIONS AND MARRY HIM THAT IS REALLY WHAT KEPT THURSTON AT THE LAZY EIGHT
7705-101578-0003 DURING THE WINTER WHEN HE DID NOT SEE HER HE COULD BRING HIMSELF TO THINK OCCASIONALLY OF OTHER THINGS AND IT IS A FACT THAT THE STORIES HE WROTE WITH NO HEROINE AT ALL HIT THE MARK THE STRAIGHTEST
7705-101578-0004 NOW WHEN HE WAS ONCE AGAIN UNDER THE SPELL OF BIG CLEAR BLUE GRAY EYES AND CRIMPLY BROWN HAIR HIS STORIES LOST SOMETHING OF THEIR VIRILITY AND VERGED UPON THE SENTIMENTAL IN TONE AND SINCE HE WAS NOT A FOOL
7705-101578-0005 HE REALIZED THE FALLING OFF AND CHAFED AGAINST IT AND WONDERED WHY IT WAS SURELY A MAN WHO IS IN LOVE SHOULD BE WELL QUALIFIED TO WRITE CONVINCINGLY OF THE OBSESSION BUT THURSTON DID NOT
7705-101578-0006 HE CAME NEAR GOING TO THE OTHER EXTREME AND REFUSING TO WRITE AT ALL THE WAGONS WERE OUT TWO WEEKS WHICH IS QUITE LONG ENOUGH FOR A CRISIS TO ARISE IN THE LOVE AFFAIR OF ANY MAN
7705-101578-0007 HIS THOUGHTS STILL RAN TO BLUE GRAY EYES AND RIPPLY HAIR BUT HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO PUT THEM INTO A STORY HE PACKED HIS TRUNK CAREFULLY WITH EVERYTHING HE WOULD NOT NEED ON THE ROUNDUP AND HIS TYPEWRITER HE PUT IN THE MIDDLE
7705-101578-0008 HE TOLD HIMSELF BITTERLY THAT HE HAD DONE WITH CRIMPLY HAIRED GIRLS AND WITH EVERY OTHER SORT OF GIRL IF HE COULD FIGURE IN SOMETHING HEROIC ONLY HE SAID MELODRAMATIC HE MIGHT POSSIBLY FORCE HER TO THINK WELL OF HIM
7705-101578-0009 BUT HEROIC SITUATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES COME NOT EVERY DAY TO A MAN AND GIRLS WHO DEMAND THAT THEIR KNIGHTS SHALL BE BRAVE IN FACE OF DEATH
7705-101578-0010 HE WROTE TO REEVE HOWARD THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY WERE TO START AND APOLOGIZED GRACEFULLY FOR HAVING NEGLECTED HIM DURING THE PAST THREE WEEKS AND TOLD HIM HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE HOME IN ANOTHER MONTH HE SAID THAT HE WAS
7705-101578-0011 IF HE HAD SAID CIVILIZED WOMAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE JUST AND MORE ILLUMINATING TO REEVE HOWARD WHO WONDERED WHAT SCRAPE PHIL HAD GOTTEN HIMSELF INTO WITH THOSE SAVAGES
7705-101578-0012 FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THE TRIP THURSTON WAS IN THAT FRAME OF MIND WHICH MAKES A MAN WANT TO RIDE BY HIMSELF WITH SHOULDERS HUNCHED MOODILY AND EYES STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE THE NOSE OF HIS HORSE BUT THE SKY WAS SOFT AND SEEMED TO SMILE DOWN AT HIM AND
7705-101578-0013 THE CLOUDS LOITERED IN THE BLUE OF IT AND DRIFTED AIMLESSLY WITH NO THOUGHT OF REACHING HARBOR ON THE SKY LINE FROM UNDER HIS HORSE'S FEET THE PRAIRIE SOD SENT UP SWEET EARTHY ODORS INTO HIS NOSTRILS
7705-101578-0014 AND THE TINKLE OF THE BELLS IN THE SADDLE BUNCH BEHIND HIM MADE MUSIC IN HIS EARS THE SORT OF MUSIC A TRUE COWBOY LOVES YELLOW THROATED MEADOW LARKS PERCHED SWAYING IN THE TOP OF GRAY SAGE BUSHES AND SANG TO HIM THAT
7705-101578-0015 THE WORLD WAS GOOD SOBER GRAY CURLEWS CIRCLED OVER HIS HEAD THEIR LONG FUNNY BILLS THRUST OUT STRAIGHT AS IF TO POINT THE WAY FOR THEIR BODIES TO FOLLOW AND CRIED
7705-101578-0016 SEEING IT AND SMELLING IT AND FEELING THE RIOT OF SPRING IN HIS BLOOD STRAIGHTENED THE HUNCH OUT OF HIS SHOULDERS AND ADMITTED THAT IT WAS ALL TRUE THAT THE WORLD WAS GOOD AT MILES CITY
7705-101578-0017 HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF A SMALL ARMY THE REGULARS OF THE RANGE WHICH GREW HOURLY LARGER AS THE OUTFITS ROLLED IN THE RATTLE OF MESS WAGONS DRIVEN BY THE CAMP COOK AND FOLLOWED BY THE BED WAGON WAS HEARD FROM ALL DIRECTIONS
7705-101578-0018 JINGLING CAVVIES HERDS OF SADDLE HORSES THEY WERE DRIVEN AND WATCHED OVER BY THE HORSE WRANGLER CAME OUT OF THE WILDERNESS IN THE WAKE OF THE WAGONS THURSTON GOT OUT HIS CAMERA AND TOOK PICTURES OF THE SCENE
7705-101578-0019 IN THE FIRST TEN DIFFERENT CAMPS APPEARED HE MOURNED BECAUSE TWO OTHERS WERE PERFORCED OMITTED
7705-101578-0020 AND THERE WERE FOUR BEYOND RANGE OF THE LENS PARK CAME ALONG SAW WHAT HE WAS DOING AND LAUGHED
7705-101578-0021 WHEN YUH CAN STAND ON THIS LITTLE HILL AND COUNT FIFTY OR SIXTY OUTFITS CAMPED WITHIN TWO OR THREE MILES UH HERE YUH MIGHT BEGIN TAKING PICTURES I THINK YOU'RE LOADING ME THURSTON RETORTED CALMLY
7705-101578-0022 WINDING UP THE ROLL FOR ANOTHER EXPOSURE ALL RIGHT SUIT YOURSELF ABOUT IT PARK WALKED OFF AND LEFT HIM PEERING INTO THE VIEW FINDER STILL THEY CAME
7705-101578-0023 FROM SWIFT CURRENT TO THE CYPRESS HILLS THE CANADIAN CATTLEMEN SENT THEIR WAGONS TO JOIN THE BIG MEET FROM THE SWEET GRASS HILLS TO THE MOUTH OF MILK RIVER
7705-101578-0024 FROM THE UPPER MUSSELSHELL THEY CAME AND FROM OUT THE JUDITH BASIN FROM SHELLANNE EAST TO FORT BUFORD TRULY IT WAS A GATHERING OF THE CLANS SUCH AS EASTERN MONTANA HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN
7705-101578-0025 FOR A DAY AND A NIGHT THE COWBOYS MADE MERRY IN TOWN WHILE THEIR FOREMEN CONSULTED AND THE CAPTAINS APPOINTED BY THE ASSOCIATION MAPPED OUT THE DIFFERENT ROUTES AT TIMES LIKE THESE FOREMEN SUCH AS PARK AND DEACON SMITH
7705-101578-0026 AND THE LONG SUMMER'S WORK BEGAN EACH RIDER A UNIT IN THE WAR AGAINST THE CHAOS WHICH THE WINTER HAD WROUGHT IN THE FIGHT OF THE STOCKMEN TO WREST BACK THEIR FORTUNES FROM THE WILDERNESS AND TO HOLD ONCE MORE THEIR SWAY OVER THE RANGE LAND
7705-101578-0027 TWO OF THE LAZY EIGHT WAGONS UNDER PARK AND GENE WASSON FOR HANK THAT SPRING WAS RUNNING FOUR CREWS AND HAD PROMOTED GENE WAGON BOSS OF ONE JOINED FORCES WITH THE CIRCLE BAR THE FLYING U AND A YELLOWSTONE OUTFIT
7705-101578-0028 WHOSE WAGON BOSS KNOWING BEST THE RANGE WAS CAPTAIN OF THE FIVE CREWS AND DROVE NORTH GATHERING AND HOLDING ALL STOCK WHICH PROPERLY RANGED BEYOND THE MISSOURI
7705-101578-0029 AND ALL STOCK WHICH BELONGED ON THAT RANGE WAS CUT OUT LEAVING ONLY THOSE WHICH HAD CROSSED THE RIVER DURING THE STORMS OF WINTER THESE WERE DRIVEN ON TO THE NEXT CAMPING PLACE AND HELD WHICH MEANT CONSTANT DAY HERDING AND NIGHT GUARDING WORK
7705-101578-0030 THEIR CARCASSES MADE UNSIGHTLY BLOTS IN THE COULEE BOTTOMS AND ON THE WIND SWEPT LEVELS OF THE CALVES THAT HAD FOLLOWED THEIR MOTHERS ON THE LONG TRAIL HUNDREDS HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE MARCH AND BEEN LEFT BEHIND FOR THE WOLVES BUT NOT ALL
7705-101578-0031 RANGE BRED CATTLE ARE BLESSED WITH RUGGED CONSTITUTIONS AND CAN BEAR MUCH OF COLD AND HUNGER
7705-101578-0032 AND ROOTS OUT A VERY SATISFACTORY LIVING FOR HERSELF BREEDS CALVES THAT WILL IN TIME DO LIKEWISE AND GROW FAT AND STRONG IN THE DOING HE IS A STURDY SELF RELIANT LITTLE RASCAL IS THE RANGE BRED CALF
7705-101578-0033 THURSTON FELT THAT HE HAD GLEANED ABOUT ALL THE EXPERIENCE HE NEEDED AND MORE THAN ENOUGH HARD RIDING AND SHORT SLEEPING AND HURRIED EATING HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS READY TO BID GOOD BY TO THE RANGE HE WOULD HELP TAKE THE HERD HOME HE TOLD PARK AND THEN
7705-101578-0034 HE INTENDED TO HIT THE TRAIL FOR LITTLE OLD NEW YORK
