7691-293948-0000 WITH ALL THE POMP OF WEALTH SIR SIMON HAD NEVER BEEN POPULAR AND HAD BEEN KNOWN WIDELY AS A HARD GRIPPING MAN YET HIS TRAGIC FATE AND A CERTAIN PITY THEREFORE HAD DRAWN TOGETHER A LARGE CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE
7691-293948-0001 DISTANT RELATIVES WHO HOPED TO BE MENTIONED IN THE WILL WERE PRESENT CLOTHED IN DEEPEST BLACK ALTHOUGH THEY CARED VERY LITTLE FOR THE DEAD JULIUS WHO ALREADY REGARDED HIMSELF AS IN POSSESSION OF GORE HALL WAS THERE WITH A LONG FACE AND A SATISFIED HEART
7691-293948-0002 HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD INHERITED THE WEALTH AFTER WHICH HE HAD LONG HUNGERED AND GLADDER STILL THAT HIS RIVAL BERNARD WAS DEAD WITH A STAIN ON HIS NAME IN FANCIED SECURITY HE MOVED ALONG
7691-293948-0003 NOT KNOWING WHAT RETRIBUTION WAS IN STORE FOR HIM EVEN THE PITYING ANGELS MUST HAVE LAUGHED AT HIS COMPLACENCY DURHAM AS THE SOLICITOR AND EXECUTOR OF THE DEAD MAN WAS PRESENT AND DIRECTED OPERATIONS CONNISTON
7691-293948-0004 HAD GONE TO COVE CASTLE TO SEE BERNARD AND HEAR HIS STORY AND DURHAM SMILED AS HIS EYES RESTED ON THE SMUG FACE OF THE PRESUMED HEIR THERE WAS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE TWO MEN AND JULIUS PRIVATELY DETERMINED THAT
7691-293948-0005 AND SMILED IRONICALLY AS HE THOUGHT HOW THIS SPITE WOULD BE FRUSTRATED FROM FAR AND NEAR PEOPLE WERE GATHERED FOR THE MURDER HAD MADE A GREAT STIR EVERYONE UNITED IN CONDEMNING BERNARD AND NOT ONE PERSON IN THE THRONG THOUGHT HIM INNOCENT
7691-293948-0006 LUCY WAS WEEPING ALONE AT THE HALL WITH MISSUS GILROY OFFERING HER SUCH COLD COMFORT AS SHE COULD THINK OF FOR THE GIRL WAS TRULY SORRY FOR HER COUSIN ALTHOUGH SHE BELIEVED HIM TO BE GUILTY
7691-293948-0007 HE REPROVINGLY ADVISED HER TO KEEP HER TEARS FOR SIR SIMON
7691-293948-0008 BUT LUCY IN SPITE OF BERYL'S EVIL INFLUENCE WHICH HAD RATHER WARPED HER BETTER NATURE PERSISTED IN WEEPING FOR THE MISERABLE COUSIN WHO HAD SO SUDDENLY BEEN CUT OFF IN THE MIDST OF HIS WICKEDNESS AT LEAST THAT IN THE FACE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
7691-293948-0009 WAS THE VIEW SHE TOOK OF THE MATTER AND ALICE REMAINED AT THE BOWER TALKING OVER THE DEATH WITH MISS PLANTAGENET HER JOY WHEN THE OLD LADY RETURNED WITH THE GOOD NEWS THAT BERNARD WAS YET ALIVE HAD BEEN PAINFUL TO WITNESS
7691-293948-0010 SHE WISHED TO GO AT ONCE TO COVE CASTLE BUT THIS MISS BERENGARIA BY DURHAM'S ADVICE WOULD NOT PERMIT SUSPICION MIGHT BE EXCITED
7691-293948-0011 AS THAT WOULD SEEM A NATURAL THING FOR HIM TO DO THE MEREST SUSPICION THAT BERNARD WAS ALIVE AND IN HIDING WOULD SET THE BLOODHOUNDS OF THE LAW ON THE TRAIL AND BERYL WOULD BE THE FIRST TO LOOSEN THEM THEREFORE ALICE WAITED AT HOME WITH MISS BERENGARIA
7691-293948-0012 UNTIL THE FUNERAL WAS OVER THEN THEY INTENDED TO GO TO THE HALL TO HEAR THE WILL READ MISS BERENGARIA HAD SOME IDEA OF THE PUNISHMENT THAT AWAITED JULIUS AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABSENT FOR HALF OF HER INCOME
7691-293948-0013 SHE DETESTED THE YOUNG MAN WITH ALL THE VIRULENCE OF HER HONEST NATURE AND SHE INSISTED ON ALICE COMING ALSO ALTHOUGH THE GIRL WAS UNWILLING THIS AGAIN WAS BY DURHAM'S ADVICE HE WANTED BOTH LADIES TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW MATTERS STOOD
7691-293948-0014 IT WOULD SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE OF AN EXPLANATION AND THEN SINCE HE AND THE TWO LADIES AND CONNISTON WERE BENT UPON PROVING BERNARD'S INNOCENCE DURHAM WANTED ALL WHO COULD BE SPARED WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE CONNISTON TO BE PRESENT SO AS TO DAUNT BERNARD'S ENEMIES
7691-293948-0015 SHOULD JULIUS LOSE HIS TEMPER OVER THE WILL IT WAS PROBABLE THAT HE MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKELY TO AFFORD A CLUE TO THE TRUE ASSASSIN AND THEN MISSUS GILROY WAS AN ENEMY ALSO AND SHE MIGHT BE UNGUARDED IN HER SPEECH
7691-293948-0016 DURHAM HAD A VAGUE IDEA THAT BOTH KNEW MORE THAN THEY ADMITTED AS TO LUCY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHETHER SHE WAS FRIENDLY OR HOSTILE SIR SIMON'S BODY WAS DULY INTERRED AND HE LEFT ALL HIS WEALTH BEHIND HIM TO TAKE UP HIS ABODE IN THE DARK VAULT
7691-293948-0017 MADE HASTE TO GO JULIUS WITH DURHAM RETURNED IN THE CARRIAGE
7691-293948-0018 FLOCKING LIKE VULTURES TO THE FEAST
7691-293948-0019 HE ASKED NO SAID BERYL RAISING HIS PALE EYES AND LOOKING AS SAD AS ANY OWL I FEAR HE IS DEAD IN HIS SIN YOU CAN'T BE SURE IF HE DID SIN MISTER BERYL THE JURY THOUGHT SO
7691-293948-0020 A JURY IS NOT ALWAYS INFALLIBLE I THINK THE CASE HAD A FAIR HEARING MISTER DURHAM SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASED HAD THE VERDICT BEEN OTHERWISE
7691-293948-0021 BUT SINCE HE IS DEAD LET HIS EVIL REST WITH HIM YOU WILL NOT HEAR ME SAY A WORD AGAINST HIS MEMORY ADDED THE VIRTUOUS JULIUS PERHAPS IT WILL BE AS WELL REPLIED DURHAM DRYLY YOU NEVER WERE A FRIEND OF BERNARD'S
7691-293948-0022 ALL THE MORE PRAISE TO ME THAT I SHOULD NOT RUN HIM DOWN TELL ME BERYL DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE COMMITTED THE CRIME I ANSWERED THAT INDIRECTLY BEFORE YES I BELIEVE HE WAS GUILTY
7691-293948-0023 THEN IT IS JUST AS WELL HE IS DEAD JUST AS WELL ASSERTED BERYL QUICKLY
7691-293948-0024 JULIUS STARTED WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO HE DEMANDED UNEASILY WELL YOU SEE BERNARD WAS A GOOD SWIMMER AND THE BEST SWIMMER IN THE WORLD COULD DO NOTHING AGAINST THE CURRENT OF THE THAMES ON A FOGGY NIGHT
7691-293948-0025 ON A FINE DAY I DARE SAY HE MIGHT HAVE GAINED THE OPPOSITE BANK BUT IN THE FOG HE MUST HAVE CIRCLED ROUND AND ROUND UNTIL HE WAS EXHAUSTED YET HIS CLOTHES WERE DISCOVERED ON THE BANK PERSISTED DURHAM
7691-293948-0026 I WONDER IF I OFFERED A REWARD WOULD ANYTHING BE DISCOVERED HIS CORPSE MIGHT SAID BERYL UNPLEASANTLY BUT NO REWARD SHALL BE OFFERED BETTER LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE
7691-293948-0027 BUT SURELY MISTER BERYL IF YOU INHERIT THE PROPERTY YOU WILL SEEK FOR THE POOR FELLOW'S DEAD BODY NO REPLIED JULIUS DECISIVELY
7691-293948-0028 ALL THE BETTER FOR HIS MEMORY AND THE POSITION OF THE FAMILY I SHALL OFFER NO REWARD DURHAM SEEING THE YOUNG MAN WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF HIS INHERITANCE AND THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO ACT IN A MOST NIGGARDLY SPIRIT
7691-293948-0029 LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO HIDE A SMILE POOR SIR BERNARD HE SAID SIR BERNARD QUESTIONED THE SUPPOSED HEIR RAISING HIS EYEBROWS CERTAINLY
7691-293948-0030 ON THE DEATH OF SIR SIMON BERNARD TOOK THE TITLE HE HASN'T ENJOYED IT LONG SAID BERYL WITH SO VILLAINOUS A SNEER THAT THE LAWYER LONGED TO PITCH HIM OUT OF THE CARRIAGE AND SEEING HE IS DEAD I SUPPOSE THE TITLE BECOMES EXTINCT
7691-293948-0031 IT DOES ASSENTED DURHAM GRAVELY BERNARD WAS THE ONLY HEIR IN THE DIRECT LINE JULIUS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WELL I'LL BE QUITE CONTENT WITH THE MONEY SAID HE
7691-293948-0032 HERE WE ARE SAID DURHAM AS THE CARRIAGE STOPPED BY THE WAY MISS PLANTAGENET AND MISS MALLESON HAVE COME TO HEAR THE WILL READ I HOPE YOU DON'T OBJECT YES I DO RETORTED BERYL ANGRILY AS HE ALIGHTED
7691-293948-0033 BUT REMEMBER MISS MALLESON HAS LOST BERNARD ALL THE BETTER FOR HER SHE WOULD HAVE HAD A MISERABLE LIFE WITH THAT FELLOW DURHAM SUPPRESSED A VIOLENT INCLINATION TO PUNCH THE MAN'S HEAD
7691-293948-0034 BUT KNOWING WHAT PUNISHMENT AWAITED HIM HE WALKED UP THE STEPS WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HERE WAS A CHANGE INDEED FROM THE MEEK JULIUS OF THE OLD DAYS THIS PRESUMED HEIR WAS OBNOXIOUS AND INSOLENT
7691-293948-0035 THINKING HE WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF ENTERING INTO HIS KINGDOM THE LAWYER WAS BY NO MEANS A VINDICTIVE PERSON
7691-293948-0036 HOWEVER WHEN JULIUS REACHED THE DRAWING ROOM IN WHICH THOSE INVITED TO HEAR THE WILL READ WERE ASSEMBLED HE ADOPTED A MORE CONCILIATORY MANNER SEVERAL RELATIVES WERE PRESENT AND MISSUS GILROY HEADED THE SERVANTS AT THE END OF THE ROOM
7691-293948-0037 MISS BERENGARIA SAT BESIDE ALICE IN A RECESS SOMEWHAT SCREENED BY THE WINDOW CURTAIN BUT LUCY WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN HOWEVER WHEN DURHAM TOOK HIS SEAT AT A SMALL TABLE AND OPENED HIS BAG SHE ENTERED IN DEEP MOURNING
7691-293948-0038 JULIUS WENT TO MEET HER DEAR LUCY HE SAID WE HAVE BURIED OUR BEST FRIEND LUCY MADE NO REPLY AND DRAWING HER HAND AWAY WALKED TO WHERE ALICE WAS SEATED
7691-293948-0039 SHE KISSED THE GIRL WHOM BERNARD HAD LOVED IN SILENCE AND IN SILENCE WAS THE KISS RETURNED EVEN MISS BERENGARIA VOLUBLE AS SHE WAS ON ALL OCCASIONS HELD HER PEACE
7691-293948-0040 SHE SAW THAT LUCY WAS SINCERELY SORRY FOR THE LOSS OF HER COUSIN AND FROM THAT MOMENT SHE ENTERTAINED A BETTER OPINION OF HER ALICE DREW LUCY INTO A SEAT BESIDE HER AND THE TWO GIRLS SAT SIDE BY SIDE WHILE JULIUS
7691-293948-0041 ALREADY ASSUMING THE AIRS OF A MASTER BADE THE COMPANY WELCOME I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU ALL HE SAID IN AN IMPORTANT VOICE AND I AM SURE THAT OUR DECEASED RELATIVE IN HIS WILL HAS DONE ALL THAT HIS KIND HEART INSPIRED HIM TO DO
7691-293948-0042 MISTER DURHAM WILL NOW READ THE WILL WHEN HE SAT DOWN SOME OF THE RELATIVES SMILED AT THE PHRASE ABOUT A KIND HEART FOR WHICH THE LATE BARONET HAD BEEN IN NO WISE REMARKABLE
7691-293948-0043 DURHAM TOOK NO NOTICE OF BERYL'S LITTLE SPEECH BUT OPENED THE WILL AND BEGAN TO READ JULIUS LISTENED WITH A COMPLACENT SMILE WHICH CHANGED AS THE READING WENT ON LEGACIES WERE LEFT TO NEARLY ALL THE SERVANTS WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE TESTATOR A LONG TIME
7691-293948-0044 LUCY BECAME ENTITLED TO THREE HUNDRED A YEAR AND MISSUS GILROY RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED THE SUM ALLOTTED TO HER DID NOT SATISFY HER AS SHE FROWNED WHEN IT WAS MENTIONED BERYL'S NAME WAS NOT MENTIONED
7691-293948-0045 BUT HE DID NOT MIND AS HE WAS WAITING FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE RESIDUE OF THE ESTATE BUT WHEN DURHAM READ OUT THAT THE ESTATE HAD BEEN LEFT ENTIRELY TO BERNARD GORE WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF THE ABOVE NAMED LEGACIES HE STARTED TO HIS FEET
7691-293948-0046 AND WITH A GHASTLY WHITE FACE I AM THE HEIR BY A FORMER WILL INTERPOSED DURHAM OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY BY A WILL WHICH SIR SIMON AFTERWARDS DESTROYED
7691-293948-0047 HE DISINHERITED BERNARD CRIED JULIUS SAVAGELY NO THE WILL THIS WILL WHICH GIVES MISTER GORE THE MONEY WAS NEVER CANCELLED
7691-293948-0048 A NEW WILL WAS PREPARED LEAVING ALL TO ME YOU READ IT TO ME YOURSELF IN YOUR OFFICE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF SIR SIMON QUITE SO REJOINED THE LAWYER SMOOTHLY FOLDING UP THE PARCHMENT
7691-293948-0049 BUT AFTER YOU LEFT SIR SIMON REFUSING TO EXECUTE THAT WILL PUT IT INTO THE FIRE IT IS A LIE IT IS THE TRUTH SAID DURHAM HIS COLOR RISING
7691-293948-0050 I CAN BRING FORWARD MY CLERKS WHO WERE TO WITNESS THE NEW WILL AND THEY WILL STATE THAT IT WAS NEVER EXECUTED SIR SIMON CHANGED HIS MIND THE ESTATE GOES TO SIR BERNARD GORE THE NEW BARONET
7691-293948-0051 AND AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE WILL I WILL TAKE CHARGE OF ALL MONIES AND OF THE PROPERTY UNTIL HE COMES FORWARD TO CLAIM THEM BUT YOU KNOW HE IS DEAD SAID JULIUS CLENCHING HIS HAND
7691-293948-0052 I KNOW NOTHING OF THE SORT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD BUT WE MUST HAVE PROOF OF THE DEATH A PRODUCTION OF HIS BODY WILL BE SUFFICIENT MISTER BERYL ADDED DURHAM CYNICALLY
7691-293948-0053 I THINK ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT YOU HAD BETTER OFFER THAT REWARD I SPOKE OF YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE FOOL WITH ME SAID JULIUS HARDLY ABLE TO SPEAK FOR PASSION NO I ADVISED YOU WHAT TO DO
7691-293948-0054 ONE MOMENT SAID A PRECISE MAN WHO HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THE WILL IF YOUNG GORE REALLY IS DEAD WHICH I FOR ONE HOPE IS NOT THE CASE WHO INHERITS THE MONEY
7691-293948-0055 SAID DURHAM WHICH I HAD INTENDED TO READ WHEN INTERRUPTED BY MISTER BERYL HE RE OPENED THE PARCHMENT IN IT SIR SIMON LEAVES THE PROPERTY TO CHARITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ANY LEGACIES THIS IN THE EVENT OF BERNARD GORE MAKING NO WILL
7691-293948-0056 BUT THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN LEFT UNRESERVEDLY TO HIM AND SHOULD HE BE ALIVE HE HAS THE POWER TO WILL IT TO WHOMSOEVER HE WISHES AND IF HE IS DEAD THE PROPERTY GOES TO A CHARITY YES
7691-293948-0057 I WILL READ THE CODICIL AND THIS DURHAM DID TO THE DISMAY OF THE COMPANY ONLY MISS BERENGARIA CHUCKLED SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT BERYL HAD BEEN PUNISHED
7691-293948-0058 AS FOR ALICE REMEMBERING THAT BERNARD WAS ALIVE AND WELL SHE FOUND IT HARD TO CONTAIN HER SATISFACTION THAT HE HAD BEEN FAIRLY DEALT WITH EVEN THE THOUGHT OF THE CRIME UNDER THE BAN OF WHICH HE LAY FADED FOR THE MOMENT FROM HER MIND
7691-293948-0059 JULIUS WITH A CERTAIN MALIGNANCY BROUGHT IT BACK TO HER RECOLLECTION
7691-293948-0060 HE CANNOT INHERIT AS A FELON SAID HE PARDON ME INTERPOSED THE LAWYER YOU HAVE YET TO PROVE HIS GUILT IT WAS PROVED AT THE INQUEST
7691-293948-0061 A JURY AT AN INQUEST HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO CONDEMN A MAN SAID DURHAM SHARPLY IF SIR BERNARD JULIUS WINCED AT THE TITLE IS ALIVE AND COMES FORWARD I SHALL DO MY BEST TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE
7691-293948-0062 AND IN ANY CASE SAID MISS BERENGARIA IN CLEAR TONES MISTER BERYL DOES NOT BENEFIT JULIUS TURNED ON HER WITH FURY AND SEEMED ON THE POINT OF BREAKING OUT INTO WRATHFUL SPEECH
7691-293948-0063 BUT HIS HABITUAL DISSIMULATION CAME TO HIS AID AND HE SUPPRESSED HIMSELF MORE THAN THAT HE ATTEMPTED TO SMILE I DON'T SAY THAT I DO NOT FEEL HURT HE SAID WITH A DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT CHEERFULNESS
7691-293948-0064 SIR SIMON DISTINCTLY NAMED ME AS HIS HEIR AND MOREOVER ASKED MISTER DURHAM TO READ THE NEW WILL IN WHICH I WAS NAMED AS SUCH PERFECTLY TRUE SAID DURHAM COLDLY
7691-293948-0065 BUT SIR SIMON CHANGED HIS MIND AND BURNT THE NEW WILL IT WAS NEVER EXECUTED AS I SAY SIR SIMON HAD EVERY RIGHT TO DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIS OWN
7691-293948-0066 SAID THE DIPLOMATIC BERYL WHILE MISS BERENGARIA WONDERING WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND WATCHED HIM WITH HER KEEN EYES BUT AS I SAY I AM HURT I QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT SIR SIMON HAD DISINHERITED MY COUSIN
7691-293948-0067 BUT I WAS PREPARED TO ALLOW HIM AN INCOME HAD I RECEIVED THE PROPERTY TWO HUNDRED A YEAR SAID THE LAWYER A MUNIFICENT OFFER IT WAS APPROVED BY SIR SIMON SAID JULIUS CALMLY
7691-293948-0068 HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT SIR SIMON RESCINDED THE NEW WILL IT WAS NEVER EXECUTED THEN WE WILL SAY HE NEVER EXECUTED IT THE MONEY GOES TO BERNARD GORE SO FAR AS I BELIEVE HE IS DEAD
7691-293948-0069 BUT I HOPE MISTER DURHAM AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE WILL OFFER A REWARD TO PROVE IF HE IS DEAD OR ALIVE WITH REGARD TO THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME THE JURY AT THE INQUEST FOUND BERNARD GUILTY WITHOUT ONE DISSENTING VOICE
7691-293948-0070 HOWEVER I AM WILLING TO GIVE MY COUSIN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND SHOULD HE REAPPEAR AND I HOPE HE MAY I SHALL DO MY BEST TO AID HIM TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE
7691-293948-0071 I HOPE ANY WORDS THAT MAY HAVE ESCAPED ME IN THE HEAT CAUSED BY A DISAPPOINTMENT WILL BE OVERLOOKED WHETHER ANY OF THOSE PRESENT BELIEVED THIS STATEMENT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY EVERYONE LOOKED DOWN AND NO RESPONSE WAS MADE
7691-293948-0072 SAVE BY MISS PLANTAGENET SHE ROSE AND WALKING ACROSS THE ROOM OFFERED HER HAND TO THE DISAPPOINTED HEIR YOU ARE A GOOD YOUNG MAN SHE SAID HEARTILY AND I HOPE YOU WILL COME AND SEE ME
7691-293948-0073 JULIUS RATHER TAKEN ABACK BY THIS INVITATION FROM ONE WHOM HE HAD CAUSE TO THINK LOVED HIM BUT LITTLE GRASPED HER HAND AND THANKED HER WITH GREAT FERVENCY HER SPEECH WAS A RELIEF TO HIM
7691-293948-0074 AND HE SAT DOWN WITH A CALMER FACE WHEN THE OLD LADY RETURNED TO HER SEAT WHY DID YOU DO THAT AUNT ASKED ALICE DISMAYED MY DEAR WHISPERED MISS BERENGARIA WITH A GRIM SMILE THAT YOUNG MAN
7691-293948-0075 MEANS MISCHIEF I AM TAKING MISTER DURHAM'S ADVICE AND MAKING FRIENDS WITH HIM THAT I MAY THWART HIS PLANS THIS WAS WHISPERED SO SOFTLY THAT LUCY DID NOT OVERHEAR
7691-293948-0076 NOR HAD IT BEEN SPOKEN ALOUD WOULD SHE HAVE ATTENDED DURHAM HAD COME FORWARD AND WAS SPEAKING EARNESTLY TO HER I TRUST YOU WILL STOP AT THE HALL FOR THE PRESENT HE SAID UNTIL BERNARD COMES HOME WILL BERNARD EVER COME HOME
7691-293948-0077 ASKED LUCY SIGHING LET US HOPE SO I DOUBT IF HE IS DEAD AND I WILL NOT BELIEVE HE IS UNTIL HIS BODY IS LAID BEFORE ME AS TO THE CRIME I DO NOT BELIEVE HE COMMITTED IT HOWEVER
7691-293948-0078 I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE AS THE CHATELAINE OF THE HALL ALL THINGS WILL GO ON AS BEFORE AM I TO STAY SIR ASKED MISSUS GILROY COMING FORWARD YES NOR WILL THE SERVANTS BE CHANGED
7691-293948-0079 BUT YOU I WILL STOP ON IN MY OLD POSITION IF MISS RANDOLPH WISHES LUCY NODDED YES LET ALL THINGS REMAIN AS THEY WERE SHE SAID MISSUS GILROY MADE A STIFF CURTSEY
7691-293948-0080 AND RETURNED TO THE OTHER SERVANTS WHO THEN FILED IN AN ORDERLY MANNER OUT OF THE ROOM THE RELATIVES ALSO TOOK THEIR LEAVE AMONGST THEM JULIUS NOW SMILING AT THE DOOR LUCY SAID SOMETHING TO HIM ABOUT BERNARD
7691-293948-0081 HE SMILED DARKLY WE HAVE YET TO PROVE THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE HE SAID DANGER THOUGHT MISS BERENGARIA
