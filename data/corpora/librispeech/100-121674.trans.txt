100-121674-0000 SAY WHAT DO YOU SEE WITH YOUR BIG ROUND EYE ON CHRISTMAS WE RABBITS SAYS BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY LITTLE DOROTHY HAD PASSED ALL THE FEW YEARS OF HER LIFE IN THE COUNTRY
100-121674-0001 AND BEING THE ONLY CHILD UPON THE FARM SHE WAS ALLOWED TO ROAM ABOUT THE MEADOWS AND WOODS AS SHE PLEASED ON THE BRIGHT SUMMER MORNINGS DOROTHY'S MOTHER WOULD TIE A SUN BONNET UNDER THE GIRL'S CHIN
100-121674-0002 AND THEN SHE ROMPED AWAY TO THE FIELDS TO AMUSE HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERY FLOWER THAT GREW AND TO CALL THEM BY NAME AND SHE ALWAYS STEPPED VERY CAREFULLY TO AVOID TREADING ON THEM FOR DOROTHY WAS A KIND HEARTED CHILD
100-121674-0003 AND DID NOT LIKE TO CRUSH THE PRETTY FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN HER PATH AND SHE WAS ALSO VERY FOND OF ALL THE ANIMALS AND LEARNED TO KNOW THEM WELL AND EVEN TO UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN DO AND THE ANIMALS LOVED DOROTHY IN TURN
100-121674-0004 FOR THE WORD PASSED AROUND AMONGST THEM THAT SHE COULD BE TRUSTED TO DO THEM NO HARM FOR THE HORSE WHOSE SOFT NOSE DOROTHY OFTEN GENTLY STROKED TOLD THE COW OF HER KINDNESS AND THE COW TOLD THE DOG AND THE DOG TOLD THE CAT
100-121674-0005 LOOKED OUT OF A SMALL BUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE WOOD ONE DAY AND SAW DOROTHY STANDING A LITTLE WAY OFF HE DID NOT SCAMPER AWAY AS IS HIS CUSTOM BUT SAT VERY STILL AND MET THE GAZE OF HER SWEET EYES BOLDLY
100-121674-0006 UNTIL THE RABBIT BECAME REASSURED AND BLINKED HIS BIG EYES AT HER THOUGHTFULLY FOR HE WAS AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE LITTLE GIRL AS SHE IN HIM SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DARED TO MEET A PERSON FACE TO FACE
100-121674-0007 FINALLY DOROTHY VENTURED TO SPEAK SO SHE ASKED VERY SOFTLY AND SLOWLY OH LITTLE BUN RABBIT SO SOFT AND SO SHY SAY WHAT DO YOU SEE WITH YOUR BIG ROUND EYE MANY THINGS ANSWERED THE RABBIT
100-121674-0008 WHO WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THE GIRL SPEAK IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE IN SUMMER TIME I SEE THE CLOVER LEAVES THAT I LOVE TO FEED UPON AND THE CABBAGES AT THE END OF THE FARMER'S GARDEN I SEE THE COOL BUSHES WHERE I CAN HIDE FROM MY ENEMIES
100-121674-0009 AND I SEE THE DOGS AND THE MEN LONG BEFORE THEY CAN SEE ME OR KNOW THAT I AM NEAR AND THEREFORE I AM ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY IS THAT THE REASON YOUR EYES ARE SO BIG ASKED DOROTHY I SUPPOSE SO RETURNED THE RABBIT
100-121674-0010 YOU SEE WE HAVE ONLY OUR EYES AND OUR EARS AND OUR LEGS TO DEFEND OURSELVES WITH WE CANNOT FIGHT BUT WE CAN ALWAYS RUN AWAY AND THAT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO SAVE OUR LIVES THAN BY FIGHTING WHERE IS YOUR HOME BUNNY ENQUIRED THE GIRL

100-121674-0020 OF COURSE I CONSENTED FOR WE ALL LIKE TO PLEASE OLD SANTA AND A MINUTE LATER I HAD JUMPED INTO THE SLEIGH BESIDE HIM AND WE WERE DASHING AWAY AT FULL SPEED TOWARD HIS CASTLE I ENJOYED THE RIDE VERY MUCH BUT I ENJOYED THE CASTLE FAR MORE
100-121674-0021 FOR IT WAS ONE OF THE LOVELIEST PLACES YOU COULD IMAGINE IT STOOD ON THE TOP OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN AND IS BUILT OF GOLD AND SILVER BRICKS AND THE WINDOWS ARE PURE DIAMOND CRYSTALS
100-121674-0022 THE ROOMS ARE BIG AND HIGH AND THERE IS A SOFT CARPET UPON EVERY FLOOR AND MANY STRANGE THINGS SCATTERED AROUND TO AMUSE ONE SANTA CLAUS LIVES THERE ALL ALONE EXCEPT FOR OLD MOTHER HUBBARD WHO COOKS THE MEALS FOR HIM
100-121674-0023 AND HER CUPBOARD IS NEVER BARE NOW I CAN PROMISE YOU AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE THERE IS ONE BIG ROOM AND THAT IS SANTA'S WORK SHOP WHERE HE MAKES THE TOYS ON ONE SIDE IS HIS WORK BENCH WITH PLENTY OF SAWS AND HAMMERS AND JACK KNIVES
100-121674-0024 AFTER MOTHER HUBBARD HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD DINNER AND I HAD EATEN SOME OF THE MOST DELICIOUS CLOVER I HAVE EVER TASTED SANTA TOOK ME UP INTO HIS WORK ROOM AND SAT ME UPON THE TABLE IF I CAN ONLY MAKE RABBITS HALF AS NICE AS YOU ARE HE SAID
100-121674-0025 THE LITTLE ONES WILL BE DELIGHTED THEN HE LIT A BIG PIPE AND BEGAN TO SMOKE AND SOON HE TOOK A ROLL OF SOFT FUR FROM A SHELF IN A CORNER AND COMMENCED TO CUT IT OUT IN THE SHAPE OF A RABBIT HE SMOKED AND WHISTLED ALL THE TIME HE WAS WORKING
100-121674-0026 AND HE TALKED TO ME IN SUCH A JOLLY WAY THAT I SAT PERFECTLY STILL AND ALLOWED HIM TO MEASURE MY EARS AND MY LEGS SO THAT HE COULD CUT THE FUR INTO THE PROPER FORM
100-121674-0027 AND SO HE SNIPPED A LITTLE OFF THE FUR HE WAS CUTTING
100-121674-0028 AND AGAIN HE SAID GOOD GRACIOUS THE EARS ARE TOO SHORT ENTIRELY SO HE HAD TO GET A NEEDLE AND THREAD AND SEW ON MORE FUR TO THE EARS SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE THE RIGHT SIZE BUT AFTER A TIME IT WAS ALL FINISHED
100-121674-0029 AND THEN HE STUFFED THE FUR FULL OF SAWDUST AND SEWED IT UP NEATLY AFTER WHICH HE PUT IN SOME GLASS EYES THAT MADE THE TOY RABBIT LOOK WONDERFULLY LIFE LIKE WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE HE PUT IT ON THE TABLE BESIDE ME
100-121674-0030 AND AT FIRST I DID N'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS THE LIVE RABBIT OR THE TOY RABBIT WE WERE SO MUCH ALIKE
100-121674-0031 I MUST PUT A SQUEAK IN IT SAID SANTA SO HE TOOK A BOX OF SQUEAKS FROM A SHELF AND PUT ONE INTO THE RABBIT BEFORE HE SEWED IT UP WHEN IT WAS ALL FINISHED HE PRESSED THE TOY RABBIT WITH HIS THUMB AND IT SQUEAKED SO NATURALLY THAT I JUMPED OFF THE TABLE
100-121674-0032 FEARING AT FIRST THE NEW RABBIT WAS ALIVE OLD SANTA LAUGHED MERRILY AT THIS AND I SOON RECOVERED FROM MY FRIGHT AND WAS PLEASED TO THINK THE BABIES WERE TO HAVE SUCH PRETTY PLAYTHINGS
100-121674-0033 AFTER THIS SAID SANTA CLAUS I CAN MAKE RABBITS WITHOUT HAVING YOU FOR A PATTERN BUT IF YOU LIKE YOU MAY STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER IN MY CASTLE AND AMUSE YOURSELF I THANKED HIM AND DECIDED TO STAY
100-121674-0034 SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS I WATCHED HIM MAKING ALL KINDS OF TOYS AND I WONDERED TO SEE HOW QUICKLY HE MADE THEM AND HOW MANY NEW THINGS HE INVENTED I ALMOST WISH I WAS A CHILD I SAID TO HIM ONE DAY FOR THEN I TOO COULD HAVE PLAYTHINGS
100-121674-0035 AH YOU CAN RUN ABOUT ALL DAY IN SUMMER AND IN WINTER AND ENJOY YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN WAY SAID SANTA BUT THE POOR LITTLE CHILDREN ARE OBLIGED TO STAY IN THE HOUSE IN THE WINTER AND ON RAINY DAYS IN THE SUMMER
100-121674-0036 AND THEN THEY MUST HAVE TOYS TO AMUSE THEM AND KEEP THEM CONTENTED I KNEW THIS WAS TRUE SO I ONLY SAID ADMIRINGLY YOU MUST BE THE QUICKEST AND THE BEST WORKMAN IN ALL THE WORLD SANTA I SUPPOSE I AM HE ANSWERED
100-121674-0037 BUT THEN YOU SEE I HAVE BEEN MAKING TOYS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND I MAKE SO MANY IT IS NO WONDER I AM SKILLFUL AND NOW IF YOU ARE READY TO GO HOME I LL HITCH UP THE REINDEER AND TAKE YOU BACK AGAIN
100-121674-0038 OH NO SAID I I PREFER TO RUN BY MYSELF FOR I CAN EASILY FIND THE WAY AND I WANT TO SEE THE COUNTRY IF THAT IS THE CASE REPLIED SANTA I MUST GIVE YOU A MAGIC COLLAR TO WEAR SO THAT YOU WILL COME TO NO HARM
100-121674-0039 SO AFTER MOTHER HUBBARD HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD MEAL OF TURNIPS AND SLICED CABBAGE SANTA CLAUS PUT THE MAGIC COLLAR AROUND MY NECK AND I STARTED FOR HOME I TOOK MY TIME ON THE JOURNEY FOR I KNEW NOTHING COULD HARM ME
100-121674-0040 AND I SAW A GOOD MANY STRANGE SIGHTS BEFORE I GOT BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN BUT WHAT BECAME OF THE MAGIC COLLAR ASKED DOROTHY WHO HAD LISTENED WITH BREATHLESS INTEREST TO THE RABBIT'S STORY
100-121674-0041 AFTER I GOT HOME REPLIED THE RABBIT THE COLLAR DISAPPEARED FROM AROUND MY NECK AND I KNEW SANTA HAD CALLED IT BACK TO HIMSELF AGAIN HE DID NOT GIVE IT TO ME YOU SEE HE MERELY LET ME TAKE IT ON MY JOURNEY TO PROTECT ME
100-121674-0042 THE NEXT CHRISTMAS WHEN I WATCHED BY THE ROAD SIDE TO SEE SANTA I WAS PLEASED TO NOTICE A GREAT MANY OF THE TOY RABBITS STICKING OUT OF THE LOADED SLEIGH THE BABIES MUST HAVE LIKED THEM TOO FOR EVERY YEAR SINCE I HAVE SEEN THEM AMONGST THE TOYS
100-121674-0043 SANTA NEVER FORGETS ME AND EVERY TIME HE PASSES HE CALLS OUT IN HIS JOLLY VOICE A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU BUN RABBIT THE BABIES STILL LOVE YOU DEARLY THE RABBIT PAUSED AND DOROTHY WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION
