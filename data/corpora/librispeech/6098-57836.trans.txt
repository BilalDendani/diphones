6098-57836-0000 PERSHING THE LEADER OF AMERICA'S BIGGEST ARMY IT WAS A HISTORIC MOMENT ON THAT JUNE DAY IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE WORLD WAR ON THE LANDING STAGE AT THE FRENCH HARBOR OF BOULOGNE
6098-57836-0001 WAS DRAWN UP A COMPANY OF FRENCH SOLDIERS WHO LOOKED EAGERLY AT THE APPROACHING STEAMER THEY WERE NOT DRESS PARADE SOLDIERS NOR SMART CADETS ONLY BATTLE SCARRED VETERANS HOME FROM THE TRENCHES WITH THE TIRED LOOK OF WAR IN THEIR EYES
6098-57836-0002 FOR THREE YEARS THEY HAD BEEN HOPING AND PRAYING THAT THE AMERICANS WOULD COME AND HERE THEY WERE AT LAST AS THE STEAMER SLOWLY APPROACHED THE DOCK A SMALL GROUP OF OFFICERS MIGHT BE DISCERNED
6098-57836-0003 LOOKING AS EAGERLY LANDWARD AS THE MEN ON SHORE HAD SOUGHT THEM OUT IN THE CENTER OF THIS GROUP STOOD A MAN IN THE UNIFORM OF A GENERAL IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY THERE WAS HOWEVER LITTLE TO DISTINGUISH HIS DRESS FROM THAT OF HIS STAFF
6098-57836-0004 EXCEPT THE MARKS OF RANK ON HIS COLLAR AND THE SERVICE RIBBONS ACROSS HIS BREAST TO THOSE WHO COULD READ THE INSIGNIA THEY SPELLED MANY DAYS OF ARDUOUS DUTY IN PLACES FAR REMOVED AMERICA WAS SENDING A SEASONED SOLDIER
6098-57836-0005 ONE TRIED OUT AS BY FIRE THE MAN'S FACE WAS SEAMED FROM EXPOSURE TO THE SUNS OF THE TROPICS AND THE SANDS OF THE DESERT BUT HIS DARK EYES GLOWED WITH THE UNTAMABLE FIRE OF YOUTH HE WAS FULL SIX FEET IN HEIGHT
6098-57836-0006 STRAIGHT BROAD SHOULDERED AND MUSCULAR THE WELL FORMED LEGS BETRAYED THE OLD TIME CALVALRYMAN THE ALERT POISE OF THE MAN SHOWED A NATURE CONSTANTLY ON GUARD AGAINST SURPRISE THE TYPICAL SOLDIER IN ACTION
6098-57836-0007 SUCH WAS GENERAL PERSHING WHEN HE SET FOOT ON FOREIGN SHORE AT THE HEAD OF AN AMERICAN ARMY THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT OUR SOLDIERS HAD EVER SERVED ON EUROPEAN SOIL AMERICA WAS AT LAST REPAYING TO FRANCE HER DEBT OF GRATITUDE
6098-57836-0008 FOR AID RECEIVED NEARLY A CENTURY AND A HALF EARLIER AND IT WAS AN ALSATIAN BY DESCENT WHO COULD NOW SAY LAFAYETTE WE COME WHO WAS THIS MAN WHO HAD BEEN SELECTED FOR SO IMPORTANT A TASK
6098-57836-0009 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE WORLD WERE UPON HIM WHEN HE REACHED FRANCE HIS WAS A TASK OF TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTIES AND A SINGLE SLIP ON HIS PART WOULD HAVE BROUGHT SHAME UPON HIS COUNTRY NO LESS THAN UPON HIMSELF THAT HE WAS TO SUCCEED
6098-57836-0010 AND TO WIN THE OFFICIAL THANKS OF CONGRESS ARE NOW MATTERS OF HISTORY THE STORY OF HIS WONDERFUL CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE BEST THAT GERMANY COULD SEND AGAINST HIM IS ALSO AN OFT TOLD STORY BUT THE RISE OF THE MAN HIMSELF TO SUCH COMMANDING POSITION IS A TALE NOT SO FAMILIAR
6098-57836-0011 YET NONE THE LESS INTERESTING THE GREAT GRANDFATHER OF GENERAL PERSHING WAS AN EMIGRANT FROM ALSACE FLEEING AS A BOY FROM THE MILITARY SERVICE OF THE TEUTONS HE WORKED HIS WAY ACROSS TO BALTIMORE AND NOT LONG THEREAFTER
6098-57836-0012 VOLUNTEERED TO FIGHT IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION HIS WAS THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM HE FLED TO ESCAPE A SERVICE THAT WAS HATEFUL
6098-57836-0013 BUT WAS GLAD TO SERVE IN THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY THE ORIGINAL FAMILY NAME WAS PFIRSCHING BUT WAS SOON SHORTENED TO ITS PRESENT FORM THE PERSHINGS GOT LAND GRANTS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND BEGAN TO PROSPER
6098-57836-0014 AS THE CLAN MULTIPLIED THE SONS AND GRANDSONS BEGAN TO SCATTER THEY HAD THE PIONEER SPIRIT OF THEIR ANCESTORS AT LENGTH JOHN F PERSHING A GRANDSON OF DANIEL THE FIRST IMMIGRANT WENT TO THE MIDDLE WEST TO WORK ON BUILDING RAILROADS
6098-57836-0015 THESE WERE THE DAYS JUST BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR WHEN RAILROADS WERE BEING THROWN FORWARD EVERYWHERE YOUNG PERSHING HAD EARLY CAUGHT THE FEVER AND HAD WORKED WITH CONSTRUCTION GANGS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE NOW AS THE RAILROADS PUSHED STILL FURTHER WEST

6098-57836-0017 IN A VERY PRIMITIVE HOUSE JOHN JOSEPH PERSHING WAS BORN SEPTEMBER THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE BOY INHERITED A STURDY FRAME AND A LOVE OF FREEDOM FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE FAMILY HIS MOTHER HAD COME OF A RACE QUITE AS GOOD AS THAT OF HIS FATHER
6098-57836-0018 THEY WERE HONEST LAW ABIDING GOD FEARING PEOPLE WHO SAW TO IT THAT JOHN AND THE OTHER EIGHT CHILDREN WHO FOLLOWED WERE REARED SOBERLY AND STRICTLY THE BIBLE LAY ON THE CENTER TABLE AND THE WILLOW SWITCH HUNG CONVENIENTLY BEHIND THE DOOR
6098-57836-0019 AFTER THE LINE OF RAILROAD WAS COMPLETED UPON WHICH THE FATHER HAD WORKED HE CAME TO LACLEDE AND INVESTED HIS SAVINGS IN A SMALL GENERAL STORE IT PROVED A PROFITABLE VENTURE IT WAS THE ONLY ONE IN TOWN
6098-57836-0020 AND PERSHING'S REPUTATION FOR SQUARE DEALING BROUGHT HIM MANY CUSTOMERS A NEIGHBOR PAYS HIM THIS TRIBUTE JOHN F PERSHING WAS A MAN OF COMMANDING PRESENCE HE WAS A GREAT FAMILY MAN AND LOVED HIS FAMILY DEVOTEDLY
6098-57836-0021 HE WAS NOT LAX AND RULED HIS FAMILY WELL THE PERSHING FAMILY WERE ZEALOUS CHURCH PEOPLE JOHN F PERSHING WAS THE SUNDAY SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT OF THE METHODIST CHURCH ALL THE YEARS HE LIVED HERE EVERY SUNDAY YOU COULD SEE HIM MAKING HIS WAY TO CHURCH
6098-57836-0022 WITH JOHN ON ONE SIDE AND JIM ON THE OTHER MISSUS PERSHING AND THE GIRLS FOLLOWING ALONG JOHN F PERSHING WAS A STRONG UNION MAN AND ALTHOUGH LOCAL FEELING RAN HIGH BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH HE RETAINED THE ESTEEM OF HIS NEIGHBORS
6098-57836-0023 HE HAD ONE OR TWO CLOSE CALLS FROM THE BUSHWHACKERS AS ROVING RANGERS WERE CALLED BUT HIS FAMILY ESCAPED HARM AT TIMES DURING THE WAR HE WAS ENTRUSTED WITH FUNDS BY VARIOUS OTHER FAMILIES AND ACTED AS A SORT OF LOCAL BANK
6098-57836-0024 AFTER THE WAR HE WAS POSTMASTER THE CLOSE OF THE WAR FOUND THE YOUNGER JOHN A STOCKY BOY OF FIVE HE BEGAN TO ATTEND THE VILLAGE SCHOOL AND TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN THE BOYISH SPORTS OF A SMALL TOWN
6098-57836-0025 THERE WAS ALWAYS PLENTY TO DO WHETHER OF WORK OR PLAY ONE OF HIS BOYHOOD CHUMS WRITES JOHN PERSHING WAS A CLEAN STRAIGHT WELL BEHAVED YOUNG FELLOW HE NEVER WAS PERMITTED TO LOAF AROUND ON THE STREETS
6098-57836-0026 NOBODY JUMPED ON HIM AND HE DIDN'T JUMP ON ANYBODY HE ATTENDED STRICTLY TO HIS OWN BUSINESS HE HAD HIS LESSONS WHEN HE WENT TO CLASS HE WAS NOT A BIG TALKER HE SAID A LOT IN A FEW WORDS AND DIDN'T TRY TO CUT ANY SWELL
6098-57836-0027 BETTER GO TO BED HADN'T WE NO CHARLEY I'M GOING TO WORK THIS OUT ANOTHER SCHOOLMATE GIVES US A MORE HUMAN PICTURE
6098-57836-0028 MANY A TIME WE WENT SWIMMING TOGETHER IN PRATT'S POND ABOUT THIS TIME PERSHING'S FATHER ADDED TO HIS OTHER VENTURES THE PURCHASE OF A FARM NEAR LACLEDE AND THE FAMILY MOVED OUT THERE THEN THERE WAS INDEED PLENTY OF WORK TO DO
6098-57836-0029 THE CHORES OFTEN BEGAN BEFORE SUN UP AND LASTED TILL AFTER DARK AND THE CHILDREN WERE LUCKY TO FIND TIME FOR SCHOOLING DURING THE LATE FALL AND WINTER MONTHS JOHN HOWEVER KEPT DOGGEDLY AT IT AND MANAGED TO GET A FAIR COMMON SCHOOL EDUCATION
6098-57836-0030 TO TEACH IN A NEGRO SCHOOL THIS SCHOOL HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AFTER THE WAR ENDED BUT THE TEACHER HAD GONE AND NO ONE ELSE SEEMED AVAILABLE FOR THE JOB JOHN WAS SOBER AND STUDIOUS AND BESIDES WAS SO WELL GROWN FOR HIS AGE THAT THEY BANKED ON HIS ABILITY
6098-57836-0031 TO LICK ANY NEGRO BOY THAT GOT OBSTREPEROUS HE SUCCEEDED SUFFICIENTLY IN THIS VENTURE TO CAUSE HIM TO TAKE UP TEACHING REGULARLY IN WHITE SCHOOLS WITH A VIEW TO PAYING FOR HIS EDUCATION HE WANTED TO STUDY LAW AND HIS PARENTS ENCOURAGED THE IDEA
6098-57836-0032 HIS WORK IN THESE COUNTRY SCHOOLS WAS INVALUABLE TO HIM IN TEACHING HIM HOW TO GOVERN OTHERS A FORMER PUPIL OF HIS WRITES THOUGH HE NEVER SOUGHT A QUARREL YOUNG PERSHING WAS KNOWN AS A GAME FIGHTER WHO NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED DEFEAT
6098-57836-0033 ONE DAY AT PRAIRIE MOUND AT THE NOON HOUR A BIG FARMER WITH RED SIDEBURNS RODE UP TO THE SCHOOLHOUSE WITH A REVOLVER IN HIS HAND PERSHING HAD WHIPPED ONE OF THE FARMER'S CHILDREN AND THE ENRAGED PARENT INTENDED TO GIVE THE YOUNG SCHOOLMASTER A FLOGGING

6098-57836-0035 THE FARMER GOT DOWN AND JOHN STRIPPED OFF HIS COAT HE WAS ONLY A BOY OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN AND SLENDER BUT HE THRASHED THE OLD FARMER SOUNDLY AND I HAVE HATED RED SIDEBURNS EVER SINCE
6098-57836-0036 AFTER SEVERAL TERMS OF COUNTRY SCHOOL TEACHING YOUNG PERSHING SAVED UP ENOUGH MONEY TO ENTER THE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL
6098-57836-0037 ONE OF HIS SISTERS WENT WITH HIM HE REMAINED THERE FOR TWO TERMS DOING HIS USUAL GOOD STEADY WORK BUT WAS STILL DISSATISFIED HE WANTED TO GET A BETTER EDUCATION ABOUT THIS TIME HE HAPPENED TO NOTICE AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION IN HIS DISTRICT FOR AN ENTRANCE TO WEST POINT

6098-57836-0039 BUT I WANT AN EDUCATION AND NOW I SEE HOW I CAN GET IT HIS MOTHER WAS BY NO MEANS SOLD ON THE IDEA OF HIS BECOMING A SOLDIER EITHER AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE ASSURED HER THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE A GUN FIRED IN A HUNDRED YEARS THAT SHE FINALLY CONSENTED
