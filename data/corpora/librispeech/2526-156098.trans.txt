2526-156098-0000 MISS HOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SUNDAY
2526-156098-0001 I BEG YOUR PARDON MY DEAREST FRIEND FOR HAVING GIVEN YOU OCCASION TO REMIND ME OF THE DATE OF MY LAST I WAS WILLING TO HAVE BEFORE ME AS MUCH OF THE WORKINGS OF YOUR WISE RELATIONS AS POSSIBLE
2526-156098-0002 BEING VERILY PERSUADED THAT ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WOULD HAVE YIELDED BY THIS TIME AND THEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD SOME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY TO FOUND MY OBSERVATIONS UPON AND INDEED WHAT CAN I WRITE
2526-156098-0003 BUT RAVE AT YOUR STUPID PERSECUTORS AND THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
2526-156098-0004 THAT YOU WON'T DO YOU CANNOT BEAR THE THOUGHTS OF HAVING THEIR SOLMES AND LOVELACE IS RESOLVED YOU SHALL BE HIS
2526-156098-0005 LET US SEE WHAT THEIR NEXT STEP WILL BE AS TO LOVELACE WHILE HE TELLS HIS OWN STORY
2526-156098-0006 WICKED PEOPLE TO COMBINE AGAINST SO INNOCENT A MAN BUT AS I SAID LET US SEE WHAT THEIR NEXT STEP WILL BE AND WHAT COURSE YOU WILL TAKE UPON IT AND THEN WE MAY BE THE MORE ENLIGHTENED
2526-156098-0007 AS TO YOUR CHANGE OF STYLE TO YOUR UNCLES AND BROTHER AND SISTER SINCE THEY WERE SO FOND OF ATTRIBUTING TO YOU A REGARD FOR LOVELACE AND WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO THE CONTRARY AND SINCE YOU ONLY STRENGTHENED THEIR ARGUMENTS AGAINST YOURSELF BY DENYING IT
2526-156098-0008 TO APOLOGIZE TO ME FOR THAT CHANGE OF STYLE TO THEM AND TILL YOU WILL SPEAK OUT LIKE A FRIEND TO HER UNQUESTIONABLE FRIEND I MUST TEASE YOU A LITTLE LET IT RUN THEREFORE FOR IT WILL RUN IF THEN
2526-156098-0009 BE SO GOOD AS TO WATCH
2526-156098-0010 HOW THE CAUSE FOR IT WILL COME ON WHY SHOULD IT BE PERMITTED TO STEAL UPON YOU AND YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER WHEN WE GET A GREAT COLD WE ARE APT TO PUZZLE OURSELVES TO FIND OUT WHEN IT BEGAN OR HOW WE GOT IT

2526-156098-0013 LET ME ADVISE YOU TO MIND HOW IT COMES ON FOR I AM PERSUADED
2526-156098-0014 THAT THE INDISCREET VIOLENCE OF YOUR FRIENDS ON THE ONE HAND AND THE INSINUATING ADDRESS OF LOVELACE ON THE OTHER IF THE MAN BE NOT A GREATER FOOL THAN ANY BODY THINKS HIM WILL EFFECTUALLY BRING IT TO THIS AND DO ALL HIS WORK FOR HIM
2526-156098-0015 BUT LET IT IF IT MUST BE LOVELACE OR SOLMES THE CHOICE CANNOT ADMIT OF DEBATE
2526-156098-0016 THAT IS REPORTED I SHOULD PREFER ALMOST ANY OF YOUR OTHER LOVERS TO EITHER UNWORTHY AS THEY ALSO ARE BUT WHO CAN BE WORTHY OF A CLARISSA
2526-156098-0017 I MUST OWN THAT I SHOULD THINK MYSELF INEXCUSABLE SO TO DO THE RATHER AS I AM BOLD ENOUGH TO IMAGINE IT A POINT OUT OF ALL DOUBT
