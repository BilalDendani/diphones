6670-296083-0000 MISTER SIDNEY HERBERT AFTERWARDS LORD HERBERT OF LEA WAS AT THIS TIME AT THE HEAD OF THE WAR DEPARTMENT IN ENGLAND HE WAS A MAN OF NOBLE NATURE AND TENDER HEART WHOSE WHOLE LIFE WAS SPENT IN DOING GOOD AND IN HELPING THOSE
6670-296083-0001 WHO NEEDED HELP HE HEARD WITH DEEP DISTRESS THE DREADFUL TIDINGS OF SUFFERING THAT CAME FROM THE CRIMEA AND HIS HEART RESPONDED INSTANTLY TO THE CALL FOR HELP YES THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND MUST RISE UP AND GO TO THAT FAR DESOLATE LAND
6670-296083-0002 TO TEND AND NURSE THE SICK AND WOUNDED AND DYING BUT WHO SHOULD LEAD THEM WHAT ONE WOMAN HAD THE STRENGTH THE POWER THE WISDOM THE TENDERNESS TO MEET AND OVERCOME THE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS
