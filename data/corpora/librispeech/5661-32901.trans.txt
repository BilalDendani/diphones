5661-32901-0000 RACHEL BEHELD THE THINGS WHICH WERE COMING TO PASS LIKE AN AWFUL DREAM SHE HAD BEGUN TO THINK AND NOT WITHOUT EVIDENCE THAT DORCAS FOR SOME CAUSE OR CAPRICE HAD CEASED TO THINK OF STANLEY AS SHE ONCE DID
5661-32901-0001 AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT WITHOUT PREPARATION OR APPARENT COURTSHIP THAT HER BROTHER HAD ACTUALLY WON THIS GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL HEIRESS AND THAT JUST EMERGED FROM THE SHADES OF DEATH
5661-32901-0002 WAS ABOUT TO TAKE HIS PLACE AMONG THE MAGNATES OF THE COUNTY AND NO DOUBT TO ENTER HIMSELF FOR THE BOLD AND SPLENDID GAME OF AMBITION THE STAKES OF WHICH WERE NOW IN HIS HAND TOWERED BEFORE HER LIKE AN INCREDIBLE AND DISASTROUS
5661-32901-0003 ILLUSION OF MAGIC STANLEY'S UNEASINESS LEST RACHEL'S CONDUCT SHOULD COMPROMISE THEM INCREASED HE GREW MORE NERVOUS ABOUT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN HIM AND MARK WYLDER
5661-32901-0004 IN PROPORTION AS THE WORLD GREW MORE SPLENDID AND PROSPEROUS FOR HIM WHERE IS THE WOMAN WHO WILL PATIENTLY ACQUIESCE IN THE RESERVE OF HER HUSBAND WHO SHARES HIS CONFIDENCE WITH ANOTHER
5661-32901-0005 HOW OFTEN HAD STANLEY LAKE SWORN TO HER THERE WAS NO SECRET THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF MARK WYLDER BEYOND THE CHARGE OF HIS MONEY AND MAKING A SMALL PAYMENT TO AN OLD MISSUS DUTTON IN LONDON BY HIS DIRECTION
5661-32901-0006 AND THAT BEYOND THIS HE WAS AS ABSOLUTELY IN THE DARK AS SHE OR CHELFORD WHAT THEN DID RACHEL MEAN BY ALL THAT ESCAPED HER WHEN HE WAS IN DANGER HOW THE COULD HE TELL
5661-32901-0007 SHE IS VERY CHARMING AND CLEVER OF COURSE SO LONG AS SHE SPEAKS OF THE KIND OF THING SHE UNDERSTANDS BUT WHEN SHE TRIES TO TALK OF SERIOUS BUSINESS
5661-32901-0008 SHE CERTAINLY DOES TALK SUCH NONSENSE SHE CAN'T REASON SHE RUNS AWAY WITH THINGS IT IS THE MOST TIRESOME THING YOU CAN CONCEIVE BUT YOU HAVE NOT SAID STANLEY THAT SHE DOES NOT SUSPECT THE TRUTH
5661-32901-0009 OF COURSE I SAY IT I HAVE SAID IT I SWEAR IT IF YOU LIKE
5661-32901-0010 UPON MY HONOUR AND SOUL I KNOW NO MORE OF HIS MOVEMENTS PLANS OR MOTIVES THAN YOU DO IF YOU REFLECT YOU MUST SEE IT
5661-32901-0011 EVEN LARKIN HIS OWN LAWYER IS IN THE DARK RACHEL KNOWS ALL THIS I HAVE TOLD HER FIFTY TIMES OVER AND SHE SEEMS TO GIVE WAY AT THE MOMENT INDEED THE THING IS TOO PLAIN TO BE RESISTED
5661-32901-0012 AND BY THE TIME I SEE HER NEXT HER OLD FANCY POSSESSES HER I CAN'T HELP IT BECAUSE WITH MORE RELUCTANCE THAN I CAN TELL I AT LENGTH CONSENT AT LARKIN'S ENTREATY I MAY SAY TO BANK AND FUND HIS MONEY
5661-32901-0013 BUT DORCAS'S MIND RETAINED ITS FIRST IMPRESSION SOMETIMES HIS PLAUSIBILITIES HIS VEHEMENCE AND HIS VOWS DISTURBED IT FOR A TIME BUT THERE IT REMAINED LIKE THE PICTURE OF A CAMERA OBSCURA
5661-32901-0014 INTO WHICH A MOMENTARY LIGHT HAS BEEN ADMITTED UNSEEN FOR A SECOND BUT THE IMAGES RETURN WITH THE DARKNESS AND GROUP THEMSELVES IN THEIR OLD COLOURS AND PLACES AGAIN WHATEVER IT WAS RACHEL PROBABLY KNEW IT
5661-32901-0015 THERE WAS A PAINFUL CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THERE WAS GROWING IN DORCAS'S MIND A FEELING TOWARDS RACHEL WHICH HER PRIDE FORBADE HER TO DEFINE SHE DID NOT LIKE STANLEY'S STEALTHY VISITS TO REDMAN'S FARM
5661-32901-0016 SHE DID NOT LIKE HIS MOODS OR LOOKS AFTER THOSE VISITS OF WHICH HE THOUGHT SHE KNEW NOTHING SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO BE PLEASED OR SORRY THAT RACHEL HAD REFUSED TO RESIDE AT BRANDON
5661-32901-0017 AND RACHEL SO EARNEST WHAT WAS THIS SECRET HOW DARED HER HUSBAND MASK FROM HER WHAT HE CONFIDED TO ANOTHER HOW DARED RACHEL CONFER WITH HIM INFLUENCE HIM PERHAPS UNDER HER VERY EYE
5661-32901-0018 WALKING BEFORE THE WINDOWS OF BRANDON THAT BRANDON WHICH WAS HERS AND TO WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN STANLEY PASSING HER GATE A POOR AND TIRED WAYFARER OF THE WORLD AND MADE HIM WHAT OH MAD CAPRICE
5661-32901-0019 OH FIT RETRIBUTION A WILD VOICE WAS TALKING THIS WAY TO AND FRO AND UP AND DOWN IN THE CHAMBERS OF MEMORY BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET IT SPEAK FROM HER PROUD LIPS
5661-32901-0020 SHE SMILED AND TO OUTWARD SEEMING WAS THE SAME BUT RACHEL FELT THAT THE FASHION OF HER COUNTENANCE TOWARDS HER WAS CHANGED SINCE HER MARRIAGE SHE HAD NOT HINTED TO RACHEL THE SUBJECT OF THEIR OLD CONVERSATIONS
5661-32901-0021 BURNING BENEATH HER FEELING ABOUT IT WAS NOW A DEEP ROOTED ANGER AND JEALOUSY STILL SHE WAS STANLEY'S SISTER AND TO BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD GREETED HER WITH PROPER RESPECT AND DORCAS MET HER GRACIOUSLY
5661-32901-0022 AND WITH ALL THE EXTERNALS OF KINDNESS THE CHANGE WAS SO LITTLE THAT I DO NOT THINK ANY BUT SHE AND RACHEL SAW IT AND YET IT WAS IMMENSE THERE WAS A DARK ROOM A SORT OF ANTE ROOM TO THE LIBRARY
5661-32901-0023 WITH ONLY TWO TALL AND NARROW WINDOWS AND HUNG WITH OLD DUTCH TAPESTRIES REPRESENTING THE BATTLES AND SIEGES OF MEN IN PERIWIGS PIKEMEN DRAGOONS IN BUFF COATS AND MUSKETEERS WITH MATCHLOCKS
5661-32901-0024 THE DOOR OF THE LIBRARY OPENED AND SHE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED TO SEE STANLEY ENTER WHY STANLEY THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE GONE TO NAUNTON
5661-32901-0025 SOMEHOW HE WAS NOT VERY WELL PLEASED TO SEE HER I THINK YOU'LL FIND DORCAS IN THE DRAWING ROOM OR ELSE IN THE CONSERVATORY HE ADDED I AM GLAD STANLEY I HAPPENED TO MEET YOU
5661-32901-0026 YOU CAN IF YOU PLEASE DO A GREAT DEAL IN A MOMENT CERTAINLY BUT I MAY REPENT IT AFTERWARDS STANLEY YOU MAY REGRET POSTPONING IT MUCH MORE YOU HAVE NO IDEA RACHEL HOW VERY TIRESOME YOU'VE GROWN
5661-32901-0027 YES STANLEY I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR YOU PERHAPS FOR MYSELF I HAD DIED LONG AGO WELL THAT IS ANOTHER THING BUT IN THE MEANTIME I ASSURE YOU RACHEL YOU
5661-32901-0028 STANLEY LAKE WAS GROWING ANGRY YES STANLEY
5661-32901-0029 WHAT IS HE TO DO RACHEL SAID DORCAS STANDING NEAR THE DOOR IT WAS A VERY AWKWARD PAUSE THE SPLENDID YOUNG BRIDE WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE STAGE WHO LOOKED VERY MUCH AS USUAL
5661-32901-0030 STANLEY TURNED HIS PALE GLARE OF FURY FROM RACHEL TO DORCAS AND DORCAS SAID AGAIN WHAT IS IT RACHEL DARLING RACHEL WITH A BRIGHT BLUSH ON HER CHEEKS STEPPED QUICKLY UP TO HER PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HER NECK AND KISSED HER
5661-32901-0031 AND OVER HER SHOULDER SHE CRIED TO HER BROTHER TELL HER STANLEY AND SO SHE QUICKLY LEFT THE ROOM AND WAS GONE WELL DORKIE LOVE WHAT'S THE MATTER SAID STANLEY SHARPLY AT LAST BREAKING THE SILENCE
5661-32901-0032 YOU PERHAPS CAN TELL ANSWERED SHE COLDLY YOU HAVE FRIGHTENED RACHEL OUT OF THE ROOM FOR ONE THING ANSWERED HE WITH A SNEER I SIMPLY ASKED HER WHAT SHE URGED YOU TO DO I THINK I HAVE A CLAIM TO KNOW
5661-32901-0033 AND BECAUSE SHE CAN'T PERSUADE ME TO ACCEPT HER VIEWS OF WHAT IS CHRISTIAN AND SENSIBLE SHE THREATENS TO GO MAD I THINK THAT IS HER PHRASE I DON'T THINK RACHEL IS A FOOL SAID DORCAS QUIETLY HER EYE STILL UPON STANLEY
5661-32901-0034 WHEN SHE PLEASES TO EXERT HER GOOD SENSE BUT SHE CAN WHEN SHE PLEASES BOTH TALK AND ACT LIKE A FOOL AND PRAY WHAT DOES SHE WANT YOU TO DO STANLEY THE MEREST NONSENSE BUT WHAT IS IT
5661-32901-0035 AND I HAVE HALF A DOZEN LETTERS TO WRITE AND REALLY IF I WERE TO STAY HERE AND TRY TO EXPLAIN I VERY MUCH DOUBT WHETHER I COULD WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER IF SHE HAS ANY CLEAR IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT I DON'T SEE WHY SHE SHOULD NOT TELL YOU
5661-32901-0036 FOR MY PART I DOUBT IF SHE UNDERSTANDS HERSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T DORCAS SMILED BITTERLY MYSTERY ALREADY MYSTERY FROM THE FIRST I AM TO KNOW NOTHING OF YOUR SECRETS
5661-32901-0037 AND THEREFORE WHICH I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW AND MY ENTERING THE ROOM IS THE SIGNAL FOR SILENCE A GUILTY SILENCE FOR DEPARTURE AND FOR EQUIVOCATION
5661-32901-0038 BEWARE I MAY ENTRENCH MYSELF IN THAT ISOLATION YOU ARE CHOOSING YOUR CONFIDANT AND EXCLUDING ME REST ASSURED YOU SHALL HAVE NO CONFIDENCE OF MINE WHILE YOU DO SO
5661-32901-0039 STANLEY LAKE LOOKED AT HER WITH A GAZE AT ONCE PEEVISH AND INQUISITIVE YOU TAKE A WONDERFULLY SERIOUS VIEW OF RACHEL'S NONSENSE I DO
5661-32901-0040 CERTAINLY YOU WOMEN HAVE A MARVELLOUS TALENT FOR MAKING MOUNTAINS OF MOLEHILLS YOU AND RADIE ARE ADEPTS IN THE ART
5661-32901-0041 COME NOW DORKIE BE A GOOD GIRL YOU MUST NOT LOOK SO VEXED I'M NOT VEXED WHAT THEN I'M ONLY THINKING SHE SAID THIS WITH THE SAME BITTER SMILE
5661-32901-0042 STANLEY LAKE LOOKED FOR A MOMENT DISPOSED TO BREAK INTO ONE OF HIS FURIES BUT INSTEAD HE ONLY LAUGHED HIS UNPLEASANT LAUGH WELL I'M THINKING TOO AND I FIND IT QUITE POSSIBLE TO BE VEXED AT THE SAME TIME I ASSURE YOU DORCAS
5661-32901-0043 I REALLY AM BUSY AND IT IS TOO BAD TO HAVE ONE'S TIME WASTED IN SOLEMN LECTURES ABOUT STUFF AND NONSENSE DO MAKE RACHEL EXPLAIN HERSELF IF SHE CAN I HAVE NO OBJECTION I ASSURE YOU
5661-32901-0044 BUT I MUST BE PERMITTED TO DECLINE UNDERTAKING TO INTERPRET THAT ORACLE AND SO SAYING STANLEY LAKE GLIDED INTO THE LIBRARY AND SHUT THE DOOR WITH AN ANGRY CLAP DORCAS DID NOT DEIGN TO LOOK AFTER HIM
5661-32901-0045 SHE HAD HEARD HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS LOOKING FROM THE WINDOW AT THE TOWERING AND SOMBRE CLUMPS OF HER ANCESTRAL TREES PALE PROUD WITH PERHAPS A PECULIAR GLEAM OF RESENTMENT OR MALIGNITY
5661-32901-0046 IN HER EXQUISITE FEATURES SO SHE STOOD LOOKING FORTH ON HER NOBLE POSSESSIONS ON TERRACES
