1348-135832-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR SHADOW AND HIS FAMILY
1348-135832-0001 EVERY ONE WAS ON HAND WHEN SCHOOL OPENED THE NEXT MORNING DESPITE THE FEAR THAT THE MERE MENTION OF SHADOW THE WEASEL HAD AROUSED IN ALL SAVE JIMMY SKUNK AND PRICKLY PORKY YOU SEE
1348-135832-0002 ALL FELT THEY MUST BE THERE SO THAT THEY MIGHT LEARN ALL THEY POSSIBLY COULD ABOUT ONE THEY SO FEARED IT MIGHT HELP THEM TO ESCAPE SHOULD THEY DISCOVER SHADOW HUNTING THEM SOMETIME STRIPED CHIPMUNK
1348-135832-0003 SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SHADOW THE WEASEL TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW I KNOW I HATE HIM DECLARED STRIPED CHIPMUNK AND ALL THE OTHERS NODDED THEIR HEADS IN AGREEMENT I
1348-135832-0004 DON'T KNOW A SINGLE GOOD THING ABOUT HIM HE CONTINUED BUT I KNOW PLENTY OF BAD THINGS HE IS THE ONE ENEMY I FEAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE WHO CAN GO WHEREVER I CAN
1348-135832-0005 ANY HOLE I CAN GET INTO HE CAN I'VE SEEN HIM JUST TWICE IN MY LIFE AND I HOPE I MAY NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1348-135832-0006 LIKE A SNAKE ON LEGS DECLARED STRIPED CHIPMUNK ANYWAY THAT IS WHAT HE MADE ME THINK OF BECAUSE HIS BODY WAS SO LONG AND SLIM AND HE TWISTED AND TURNED SO EASILY
1348-135832-0007 HE WAS ABOUT AS LONG AS CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL BUT LOOKED LONGER BECAUSE OF HIS SLIM BODY AND LONG NECK HE WAS BROWN ABOVE AND WHITE BELOW HIS FRONT FEET WERE WHITE AND HIS HIND FEET
1348-135832-0008 RATHER WHITISH BUT NOT CLEAR WHITE HIS SHORT ROUND TAIL WAS BLACK AT THE END SOMEHOW HIS SMALL HEAD AND SHARP FACE MADE ME THINK OF A SNAKE UGH I DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT HIM
1348-135832-0009 I SAW HIM ONCE AND HE WASN'T BROWN AT ALL STRIPED CHIPMUNK IS ALL WRONG EXCEPTING ABOUT THE END OF HIS TAIL INTERRUPTED JUMPER THE HARE HE WAS ALL WHITE
1348-135832-0010 EVERY BIT OF HIM BUT THE END OF HIS TAIL THAT WAS BLACK STRIPED CHIPMUNK IS QUITE RIGHT AND SO ARE YOU DECLARED OLD MOTHER NATURE STRIPED CHIPMUNK SAW HIM IN SUMMER
1348-135832-0011 AND YOU SAW HIM IN WINTER HE CHANGES HIS COAT ACCORDING TO SEASON JUST AS YOU DO YOURSELF JUMPER IN WINTER HE IS TRAPPED FOR HIS FUR
1348-135832-0012 BUT ERMINE OH SAID JUMPER AND LOOKED AS IF HE FELT A WEE BIT FOOLISH WHAT WAS HE DOING WHEN YOU SAW HIM ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE TURNING TO STRIPED CHIPMUNK HUNTING
1348-135832-0013 HE HAD FOUND MY TRACKS WHERE I HAD BEEN GATHERING BEECHNUTS AND HE WAS FOLLOWING THEM WITH HIS NOSE JUST THE WAY BOWSER THE HOUND FOLLOWS REDDY FOX I NEARLY DIED OF FRIGHT WHEN I SAW HIM
1348-135832-0014 YOU ARE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE DECLARED CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL I KNOW IT REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK AND SHIVERED AGAIN I KNOW IT I
1348-135832-0015 GUESS I WOULDN'T BE IF REDDY FOX HADN'T HAPPENED ALONG JUST THEN AND FRIGHTENED SHADOW AWAY
1348-135832-0016 I NEVER RAN HARDER IN MY LIFE THAN THE TIME I SAW HIM SPOKE UP JUMPER THE HARE HE WAS HUNTING ME JUST THE SAME WAY RUNNING WITH HIS NOSE IN THE SNOW
1348-135832-0017 AND FOLLOWING EVERY TWIST AND TURN I HAD MADE
1348-135832-0018 POOH EXCLAIMED JIMMY SKUNK THE IDEA OF A BIG FELLOW LIKE YOU RUNNING FROM SUCH A LITTLE FELLOW AS MY COUSIN SHADOW
1348-135832-0019 OF RUNNING DECLARED JUMPER
1348-135832-0020 BUT HE IS SO QUICK I WOULDN'T STAND THE LEAST CHANCE IN THE WORLD WHEN I SUSPECT SHADOW IS ABOUT
1348-135832-0021 IF I COULD CLIMB A TREE LIKE CHATTERER IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT NO IT WOULDN'T
1348-135832-0022 THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED ME FROM HIM ONCE WAS THE FACT THAT I COULD MAKE A LONG JUMP FROM ONE TREE TO ANOTHER AND HE COULDN'T HE HAD FOUND A HOLE IN A CERTAIN TREE WHERE I WAS LIVING
1348-135832-0023 AND IT WAS JUST LUCK THAT I WASN'T AT HOME WHEN HE CALLED I WAS JUST RETURNING WHEN HE POPPED OUT
1348-135832-0024 HE IS THE MOST AWFUL FELLOW IN ALL THE GREAT WORLD DECLARED WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE JIMMY SKUNK CHUCKLED RIGHT OUT
1348-135832-0025 HE SAID WHY YOU
1348-135832-0026 YET I COULD WALK TO IT IN A FEW MINUTES HOW DO YOU KNOW SHADOW IS THE MOST AWFUL FELLOW IN THE GREAT WORLD I JUST KNOW THAT'S ALL
1348-135832-0027 THOUGH SQUEAKY VOICE HE HUNTS AND KILLS JUST FOR THE LOVE OF IT AND NO ONE NO MATTER HOW BIG HE IS CAN DO ANYTHING MORE AWFUL THAN THAT
1348-135832-0028 I HAVE A LOT OF ENEMIES SOMETIMES IT SEEMS AS IF ALMOST EVERY ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS IS LOOKING FOR A MOUSE DINNER BUT ALL BUT SHADOW THE WEASEL HUNT ME WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY AND NEED FOOD
1348-135832-0029 I CAN FORGIVE THEM FOR THAT EVERY ONE MUST EAT TO LIVE BUT SHADOW HUNTS ME EVEN WHEN HIS STOMACH IS SO FULL HE CANNOT EAT ANOTHER MOUTHFUL THAT FELLOW JUST LOVES TO KILL
1348-135832-0030 HE TAKES PLEASURE IN IT THAT IS WHAT MAKES HIM SO AWFUL WHITEFOOT IS RIGHT DECLARED OLD MOTHER NATURE AND SHE SPOKE SADLY IF SHADOW WAS AS BIG AS BUSTER BEAR OR
1348-135832-0031 PUMA THE PANTHER OR EVEN TUFTY THE LYNX HE WOULD BE THE MOST TERRIBLE CREATURE IN ALL THE GREAT WORLD BECAUSE OF THIS AWFUL DESIRE TO KILL WHICH FILLS HIM
1348-135832-0032 HE IS HOT BLOODED QUICK TEMPERED AND FEARLESS EVEN WHEN CORNERED BY AN ENEMY AGAINST WHOM HE HAS NO CHANCE HE WILL FIGHT TO THE LAST GASP
1348-135832-0033 OUTSIDE OF THAT HE HASN'T A FRIEND IN THE WORLD NOT ONE HASN'T HE ANY ENEMIES ASKED PETER RABBIT OH YES REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1348-135832-0034 REDDY FOX OLD MAN COYOTE HOOTY THE OWL AND VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE HAWK FAMILY HAVE TO BE WATCHED FOR BY HIM BUT THEY DO NOT WORRY HIM MUCH
1348-135832-0035 YOU SEE HE MOVES SO QUICKLY DODGING OUT OF SIGHT IN A FLASH THAT WHOEVER CATCHES HIM MUST BE QUICK INDEED THEN TOO HE IS ALMOST ALWAYS CLOSE TO GOOD COVER
1348-135832-0036 HE DELIGHTS IN OLD STONE WALLS STONE PILES BRUSH GROWN FENCES PILES OF RUBBISH AND BARNS AND OLD BUILDINGS THE PLACES THAT MICE DELIGHT IN
1348-135832-0037 IN SUCH PLACES THERE IS ALWAYS A HOLE TO DART INTO IN TIME OF DANGER HE HUNTS WHENEVER HE FEELS LIKE IT BE IT DAY OR NIGHT AND OFTEN COVERS CONSIDERABLE GROUND
1348-135832-0038 THOUGH NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH HIS BIG BROWN WATER LOVING COUSIN BILLY MINK IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS WONDERFUL ABILITY TO DISAPPEAR IN AN INSTANT THAT HE IS CALLED SHADOW
1348-135832-0039 SHADOW IS KNOWN AS THE COMMON WEASEL SHORT TAILED WEASEL BROWN WEASEL BONAPARTE WEASEL AND ERMINE AND IS FOUND ALL OVER THE FORESTED PARTS OF THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY
1348-135832-0040 A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH IN THE EAST IS A COUSIN VERY MUCH LIKE HIM CALLED THE NEW YORK WEASEL ON THE GREAT PLAINS OF THE WEST IS A LARGER COUSIN WITH A LONGER TAIL CALLED THE LONG TAILED WEASEL
1348-135832-0041 LARGE ERMINE OR YELLOW BELLIED WEASEL HIS SMALLEST COUSIN IS THE LEAST WEASEL THE LATTER IS NOT MUCH LONGER THAN A MOUSE IN WINTER HE IS ALL WHITE EVEN THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
1348-135832-0042 IN SUMMER HE IS A PURER WHITE UNDERNEATH THAN HIS LARGER COUSINS ALL OF THE WEASELS ARE ALIKE IN HABITS WHEN RUNNING THEY BOUND OVER THE GROUND MUCH AS PETER RABBIT DOES
1348-135832-0043 IN THAT PART OF THE WEST WHERE YAP YAP THE PRAIRIE DOG LIVES IS A RELATIVE CALLED THE BLACKFOOTED FERRET WHO LOOKS LIKE A LARGE WEASEL HE IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF BILLY MINK BUT INSTEAD OF THE RICH DARK BROWN OF BILLY'S COAT
1348-135832-0044 HIS COAT IS A CREAMY YELLOW HIS FEET ARE BLACK AND SO IS THE TIP OF HIS TAIL HIS FACE IS WHITISH WITH A DARK BAND ACROSS THE EYES HE IS MOST FREQUENTLY FOUND IN PRAIRIE DOG TOWNS
1348-135832-0045 AND LIVES LARGELY ON YAP YAP AND HIS FRIENDS HIS WAYS ARE THOSE OF SHADOW AND HIS COUSINS THERE IS NO ONE YAP YAP FEARS QUITE AS MUCH THE ONE
1348-135832-0046 GOOD THING SHADOW THE WEASEL DOES IS TO KILL ROBBER THE RAT WHENEVER THEY MEET ROBBER AS YOU KNOW IS BIG AND SAVAGE AND ALWAYS READY FOR A FIGHT WHEN CORNERED
1348-135832-0047 BUT ALL THE FIGHT GOES OUT OF HIM WHEN SHADOW APPEARS PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW HOPELESS IT IS WHEN SHADOW FINDS A BARN OVERRUN WITH RATS HE WILL SOMETIMES STAY UNTIL HE HAS KILLED OR DRIVEN OUT THE LAST ONE
