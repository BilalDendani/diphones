4090-183987-0000 ON THE BRIGHT HAZE OF EFFIE'S HAIR AND ON THE WHITENESS OF ANNA'S FOREHEAD AS SHE LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR BEHIND THE TEA URN SHE DID NOT MOVE AT DARROW'S APPROACH BUT LIFTED TO HIM A DEEP GAZE OF PEACE AND CONFIDENCE THE LOOK SEEMED TO THROW ABOUT HIM THE SPELL OF A DIVINE SECURITY
4090-183987-0001 HE FELT THE JOY OF A CONVALESCENT SUDDENLY WAKING TO FIND THE SUNLIGHT ON HIS FACE MADAME DE CHANTELLE ACROSS HER KNITTING DISCOURSED OF THEIR AFTERNOON'S EXCURSION WITH OCCASIONAL PAUSES INDUCED BY THE HYPNOTIC EFFECT OF THE FRESH AIR
4090-183987-0002 DARROW TOOK A CHAIR BEHIND THE LITTLE GIRL SO THAT HE MIGHT LOOK ACROSS AT HER MOTHER IT WAS ALMOST A NECESSITY FOR HIM AT THE MOMENT TO LET HIS EYES REST ON ANNA'S FACE AND TO MEET NOW AND THEN THE PROUD SHYNESS OF HER GAZE MADAME DE CHANTELLE PRESENTLY ENQUIRED WHAT HAD BECOME OF OWEN
4090-183987-0003 AS HE STOOD THERE IN THE LAMP LIGHT WITH DEAD LEAVES AND BITS OF BRAMBLE CLINGING TO HIS MUD SPATTERED CLOTHES THE SCENT OF THE NIGHT ABOUT HIM AND ITS CHILL ON HIS PALE BRIGHT FACE HE REALLY HAD THE LOOK OF A YOUNG FAUN STRAYED IN FROM THE FOREST EFFIE ABANDONED THE TERRIER TO FLY TO HIM
4090-183987-0004 I WALKED MILES AND MILES WITH NURSE AND COULDN'T FIND YOU AND WE MET JEAN AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU'D GONE NOBODY KNOWS WHERE I GO OR WHAT I SEE WHEN I GET THERE THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT HE LAUGHED BACK AT HER BUT IF YOU'RE GOOD HE ADDED
4090-183987-0005 OH NOW OWEN NOW I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE I'LL EVER BE MUCH BETTER THAN I AM NOW LET OWEN HAVE HIS TEA FIRST HER MOTHER SUGGESTED BUT THE YOUNG MAN DECLINING THE OFFER PROPPED HIS GUN AGAINST THE WALL AND LIGHTING A CIGARETTE
4090-183987-0006 BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN A WAY THAT REMINDED DARROW OF HIS OWN CAGED WANDERINGS EFFIE PURSUED HIM WITH HER BLANDISHMENTS
4090-183987-0007 WHERE'S MISS VINER HE ASKED AS EFFIE CLIMBED UP ON HIM
4090-183987-0008 POOR MISS VINER HAS A HEADACHE
4090-183987-0009 AH SAID OWEN ABRUPTLY SETTING DOWN HIS CUP HE STOOD UP LIT ANOTHER CIGARETTE AND WANDERED AWAY TO THE PIANO IN THE ROOM BEYOND
4090-183987-0010 BORNE ON FANTASTIC CHORDS FLOATED TO THE GROUP ABOUT THE TEA TABLE UNDER ITS INFLUENCE MADAME DE CHANTELLE'S MEDITATIVE PAUSES INCREASED IN LENGTH AND FREQUENCY
4090-183987-0011 PRESENTLY HER NURSE APPEARED AND ANNA ROSE AT THE SAME TIME
4090-183987-0012 SHE HAD GIVEN HIM ON THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL
4090-183987-0013 THE RETREAT IN WHICH AS ONE MIGHT FANCY
4090-183987-0014 AS IF SPELL BOUND BY THE PLAY OF MADAME DE CHANTELLE'S NEEDLES AND THE PULSATIONS OF OWEN'S FITFUL MUSIC
4090-183987-0015 FINALLY DREW HIM TO HIS FEET FROM HER WRITING TABLE WHERE SHE SAT OVER A PILE OF LETTERS ANNA LIFTED HER HAPPY SMILE THE IMPULSE TO PRESS HIS LIPS TO IT MADE HIM COME CLOSE AND DRAW HER UPWARD SHE THREW HER HEAD BACK
4090-183987-0016 THEN HER FACE LEANED TO HIS WITH THE SLOW DROOP OF A FLOWER HE FELT AGAIN THE SWEEP OF THE SECRET TIDES AND ALL HIS FEARS WENT DOWN IN THEM
4090-183987-0017 HIS GAZE ROAMED PEACEFULLY ABOUT THE QUIET ROOM
4090-183987-0018 LET'S BE QUIET THEN IT'S THE BEST WAY OF TALKING YES BUT WE MUST SAVE IT UP TILL LATER
4090-183987-0019 I WANT YOU TO TELL ME ABOUT MISS VINER ABOUT MISS VINER HE SUMMONED UP A LOOK OF FAINT INTERROGATION HE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED SURPRISED AT HIS SURPRISE IT'S IMPORTANT NATURALLY SHE EXPLAINED
4090-183987-0020 IMPORTANT ON EFFIE'S ACCOUNT ON EFFIE'S ACCOUNT OF COURSE OF COURSE BUT YOU'VE EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED HAVEN'T YOU
4090-183987-0021 EVERY APPARENT REASON WE ALL LIKE HER EFFIE'S VERY FOND OF HER AND SHE SEEMS TO HAVE A DELIGHTFUL INFLUENCE ON THE CHILD BUT WE KNOW SO LITTLE AFTER ALL ABOUT HER ANTECEDENTS I MEAN AND HER PAST HISTORY
4090-183987-0022 OH ON THAT SCORE I'M AFRAID I SHA'N'T BE OF MUCH USE
4090-183987-0023 WHEN SHE WAS WITH A MISSUS MURRETT YES AN APPALLING WOMAN WHO RUNS A ROARING DINNER FACTORY THAT USED NOW AND THEN TO CATCH ME IN ITS WHEELS I ESCAPED FROM THEM LONG AGO BUT IN MY TIME THERE USED TO BE HALF A DOZEN FAGGED HANDS TO TEND THE MACHINE
4090-183987-0024 THEN YOU NEVER REALLY SAW ANYTHING OF HER THERE
4090-183987-0025 ESPECIALLY SUCH PRETTY ONES I SUPPOSE DARROW MADE NO COMMENT AND SHE CONTINUED AND MISSUS MURRETT'S OWN OPINION IF SHE'D OFFERED YOU ONE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN OF MUCH VALUE ONLY IN SO FAR AS HER DISAPPROVAL WOULD ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN A GOOD MARK FOR MISS VINER
4090-183987-0026 ANNA SMILED OH WE HEARD OF HER THROUGH ADELAIDE PAINTER
4090-183987-0027 WHO HAVING COME TO PARIS SOME THIRTY YEARS EARLIER TO NURSE A BROTHER THROUGH AN ILLNESS HAD EVER SINCE PROTESTINGLY AND PROVISIONALLY CAMPED THERE IN A STATE OF CONTEMPTUOUS PROTESTATION ODDLY MANIFESTED BY HER NEVER TAKING THE SLIP COVERS OFF HER DRAWING ROOM CHAIRS
4090-183987-0028 HER LONG RESIDENCE ON GALLIC SOIL HAD NOT MITIGATED HER HOSTILITY TOWARD THE CREED AND CUSTOMS OF THE RACE BUT THOUGH SHE ALWAYS REFERRED TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS THE SCARLET WOMAN AND TOOK THE DARKEST VIEWS OF FRENCH PRIVATE LIFE
4090-183987-0029 IT'S ALL THE ODDER BECAUSE MY MOTHER IN LAW SINCE HER SECOND MARRIAGE HAS LIVED SO MUCH IN THE COUNTRY THAT SHE'S PRACTICALLY LOST SIGHT OF ALL HER OTHER AMERICAN FRIENDS BESIDES WHICH
4090-183987-0030 WELL THEN IF SOUTH BRAINTREE VOUCHES FOR MISS VINER OH BUT ONLY INDIRECTLY
4090-183987-0031 UNLUCKILY SHE COULDN'T AT THE MOMENT PUT HER HAND ON A SWEET AMERICAN
4090-183987-0032 AND SO FAR I'VE HAD NO CAUSE TO REGRET MY CHOICE BUT I KNOW AFTER ALL VERY LITTLE ABOUT MISS VINER AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF REASONS WHY I WANT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT MORE TO FIND OUT ALL I CAN
4090-183987-0033 BUT IS THERE IN SUCH A CASE ANY RECOMMENDATION WORTH HALF AS MUCH AS YOUR OWN DIRECT EXPERIENCE
4090-183987-0034 YOU DON'T AT ANY RATE KNOW ANYTHING SPECIFIC TO THE CONTRARY TO THE CONTRARY HOW SHOULD I
4090-183987-0035 HE DREW HER TO HIM WITH A SMILE ON THAT CONDITION I'M PREPARED TO LOVE EVEN ADELAIDE PAINTER I ALMOST HOPE YOU WONT HAVE THE CHANCE TO POOR ADELAIDE HER APPEARANCE HERE ALWAYS COINCIDES WITH A CATASTROPHE OH THEN I MUST MANAGE TO MEET HER ELSEWHERE
4090-183987-0036 WHAT DOES ANYTHING MATTER BUT JUST THIS MUST I GO NOW HE ADDED ALOUD SHE ANSWERED ABSENTLY IT MUST BE TIME TO DRESS
4090-183987-0037 A KNOCK ON THE DOOR MADE THEM DRAW APART
4090-183987-0038 THE DOOR OPENED AND SOPHY VINER ENTERED SEEING DARROW SHE DREW BACK DO COME IN MISS VINER ANNA REPEATED LOOKING AT HER KINDLY THE GIRL A QUICK RED IN HER CHEEKS STILL HESITATED ON THE THRESHOLD I'M SO SORRY
