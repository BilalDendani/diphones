7055-87276-0000 HER SKIN WAS LIKE VELVET A RICH CLEAR ROSY SNOW WITH THE HOT YOUNG BLOOD GLOWING THROUGH IT LIKE THE FAINT RED TINGE WE SOMETIMES SEE ON THE INNER SIDE OF A WHITE ROSE LEAF
7055-87276-0001 ARRAS SILK SHE WAS OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH A FIGURE THAT VENUS MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
7055-87276-0002 AND APPARENTLY MADE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF DRIVING MANKIND DISTRACTED IN FACT THAT SEEMED TO BE THE PARAMOUNT OBJECT IN HER CREATION
7055-87276-0003 HER GREATEST BEAUTY WAS HER GLOWING DARK BROWN EYES WHICH SHONE WITH AN EVER CHANGING LUSTER FROM BENEATH THE SHADE OF THE LONGEST BLACKEST UPCURVING LASHES EVER SEEN HER VOICE WAS SOFT AND FULL
7055-87276-0004 AND EXCEPT WHEN ANGRY WHICH ALAS WAS NOT INFREQUENT
7055-87276-0005 SHE WAS A MOST ADROIT COAXER AND KNEW HER POWER FULL WELL ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT ALWAYS PLEAD HAVING THE TUDOR TEMPER AND PREFERRING TO COMMAND WHEN SHE COULD AS BEFORE HINTED
7055-87276-0006 YOU COULD FORM SOME IDEA OF MARY'S POWERS BY THAT ACHIEVEMENT ALONE WILL SOMMERS THE FOOL
7055-87276-0007 BUT IN FACT HARMLESS OPERATION OF WHEEDLING THE KING OUT OF HIS EARS
7055-87276-0008 THEN HEIR TO THE GREATEST INHERITANCE THAT EVER FELL TO THE LOT OF ONE MAN SPAIN THE NETHERLANDS AUSTRIA AND HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHAT ELSE
7055-87276-0009 SHE HAD BEEN MADE LOVE TO BY SO MANY MEN WHO HAD LOST THEIR SENSES IN THE DAZZLING RAYS OF HER THOUSAND PERFECTIONS OF WHOM I AM ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I FOR A TIME HAD BEEN INSANE ENOUGH TO BE ONE
7055-87276-0010 AND MAN A POOR CONTEMPTIBLE CREATURE MADE TO GROVEL AT HER FEET NOT THAT SHE LIKED OR ENCOURAGED IT FOR NEVER HAVING BEEN MOVED HERSELF SHE HELD LOVE AND ITS SUFFERINGS IN UTTER SCORN
7055-87276-0011 MAN'S LOVE WAS SO CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL THAT IT HAD NO VALUE IN HER EYES AND IT LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD LOSE THE BEST THING IN LIFE BY HAVING TOO MUCH OF IT
7055-87276-0012 SUCH WAS THE ROYAL MAID TO WHOSE TENDER MERCIES I NOW TELL YOU FRANKLY MY FRIEND BRANDON WAS SOON TO BE TURNED OVER HE HOWEVER WAS A BLADE OF VERY DIFFERENT TEMPER FROM ANY SHE HAD KNOWN
7055-87276-0013 AND WHEN I FIRST SAW SIGNS OF A GROWING INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM I FELT FROM WHAT LITTLE I HAD SEEN OF BRANDON THAT THE TABLES WERE VERY LIKELY TO BE TURNED UPON HER LADYSHIP THEN THOUGHT I GOD HELP HER
7055-87276-0014 FOR IN A NATURE LIKE HERS CHARGED WITH LATENT FORCE STRONG AND HOT AND FIERY AS THE SUN'S STORED RAYS IT NEEDED BUT A FLASH TO MAKE IT PATENT WHEN DAMAGE WAS SURE TO FOLLOW FOR SOMEBODY PROBABLY BRANDON
7055-87276-0015 MARY DID NOT COME HOME WITH US FROM WESTMINSTER THE MORNING AFTER THE JOUSTINGS AS WE HAD EXPECTED BUT FOLLOWED SOME FOUR OR FIVE DAYS LATER
7055-87276-0016 AS NEITHER HIS DUTIES NOR MINE WERE ONEROUS WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ON OUR HANDS WHICH WE EMPLOYED WALKING AND RIDING OR SITTING IN OUR COMMON ROOM READING AND TALKING OF COURSE AS WITH MOST YOUNG MEN
7055-87276-0017 THAT VERY ATTRACTIVE BRANCH OF NATURAL HISTORY WOMAN WAS A FAVORITE TOPIC AND WE ACCORDINGLY DISCUSSED IT A GREAT DEAL THAT IS TO TELL THE EXACT TRUTH I DID ALTHOUGH BRANDON HAD SEEN MANY AN ADVENTURE DURING HIS LIFE ON THE CONTINENT
7055-87276-0018 WHICH WOULD NOT DO TO WRITE DOWN HERE HE WAS AS LITTLE OF A BOASTER AS ANY MAN I EVER MET AND WHILE I AM IN THE TRUTH TELLING BUSINESS I WAS AS GREAT A BRAGGART OF MY INCHES AS EVER DREW THE LONG BOW IN THAT LINE I MEAN
7055-87276-0019 GODS I FLUSH UP HOT EVEN NOW WHEN I THINK OF IT SO I TALKED A GREAT DEAL AND FOUND MYSELF INFINITELY PLEASED WITH BRANDON'S CONVERSATIONAL POWERS WHICH WERE RARE
7055-87276-0020 BEING NO LESS THAN THE CAPACITY FOR SAYING NOTHING AND LISTENING POLITELY TO AN INFINITE DEAL OF THE SAME THING IN ANOTHER FORM FROM ME I REMEMBER THAT I TOLD HIM I HAD KNOWN THE PRINCESS MARY FROM A TIME WHEN SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
7055-87276-0021 I FEAR I TRIED TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS HER EXALTED RANK ONLY WHICH MADE HER LOOK UNFAVORABLY UPON MY PASSION
7055-87276-0022 THE TRUTH IS SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN KIND AND COURTEOUS TO ME AND HAD ADMITTED ME TO A DEGREE OF INTIMACY MUCH GREATER THAN I DESERVED THIS PARTLY AT LEAST
7055-87276-0023 A ROAD SHE TRAVELED AT AN EAGER GALLOP FOR SHE DEARLY LOVED TO LEARN FROM CURIOSITY PERHAPS I AM SURE SHE HELD ME IN HER LIGHT GENTLE HEART AS A DEAR FRIEND BUT WHILE HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH THIS MILD WARMTH FOR ME
7055-87276-0024 MINE BEGAN TO BURN WITH THE FLAME THAT DISCOLORS EVERYTHING AND I SAW HER FRIENDLINESS IN A VERY DISTORTING LIGHT SHE WAS MUCH KINDER TO ME THAN TO MOST MEN BUT I DID NOT SEE THAT IT WAS BY REASON OF MY ABSOLUTE HARMLESSNESS
7055-87276-0025 AND I SUPPOSE BECAUSE I WAS A VAIN FOOL I GRADUALLY BEGAN TO GATHER HOPE WHICH GOES WITH EVERY VAIN MAN'S LOVE AND WHAT IS MORE ACTUALLY CLIMBED TO THE VERY APEX OF IDIOCY AND DECLARED MYSELF
7055-87276-0026 I WELL KNEW THE INFINITE DISTANCE BETWEEN US BUT LIKE EVERY OTHER MAN WHO CAME WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF THIS CHARMING LODESTONE I LOST MY HEAD AND IN SHORT MADE A GREATER FOOL OF MYSELF THAN I NATURALLY WAS
7055-87276-0027 WHICH IS SAYING A GOOD DEAL FOR THAT TIME IN MY LIFE GOD KNOWS I KNEW VAGUELY BUT DID NOT FAIRLY REALIZE HOW UTTERLY BEYOND MY REACH IN EVERY WAY SHE WAS UNTIL I OPENED THE FLOOD GATES OF MY PASSION AS I THOUGHT IT
7055-87276-0028 AND SAW HER SMILE AND TRY TO CHECK THE COMING LAUGH THEN CAME A LOOK OF OFFENDED DIGNITY FOLLOWED BY A QUICK SOFTENING GLANCE LEAVE ME ONE FRIEND I PRAY YOU EDWIN I VALUE YOU TOO HIGHLY TO LOSE
7055-87276-0029 AND ESTEEM YOU TOO MUCH TO TORMENT DO NOT MAKE OF YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE FOOLS WHO FEEL OR PRETEND TO FEEL I CARE NOT WHICH SUCH PREFERENCE FOR ME
7055-87276-0030 YOU CANNOT KNOW IN WHAT CONTEMPT A WOMAN HOLDS A MAN WHO FOLLOWS HER THOUGH SHE DESPISES HIM NO MAN CAN BEG A WOMAN'S LOVE HE MUST COMMAND IT DO NOT JOIN THEIR RANKS BUT LET US BE GOOD FRIENDS
7055-87276-0031 I WILL TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT WERE WE BOTH OF THE SAME DEGREE EVEN THEN I COULD NOT FEEL TOWARD YOU AS YOU THINK YOU WISH BUT I CAN BE YOUR FRIEND AND WILL PROMISE TO BE THAT ALWAYS
7055-87276-0032 IF YOU WILL PROMISE NEVER AGAIN TO SPEAK OF THIS TO ME I PROMISED SOLEMNLY AND HAVE ALWAYS KEPT MY WORD AS THIS TRUE GRACIOUS WOMAN SO FULL OF FAULTS AND BEAUTIES VIRTUES AND FAILINGS HAS
7055-87276-0033 EVER SINCE THAT DAY AND MOMENT KEPT HERS IT SEEMED THAT MY LOVE OR WHAT I SUPPOSED WAS LOVE
7055-87276-0034 AS SHE SMILED UPON MY FIRST AVOWAL SOMEWHAT AS DISEASE MAY LEAVE THE SICKENED BODY UPON A GREAT SHOCK AND IN ITS PLACE CAME THE RESTFUL FLAME OF A FRIEND'S LOVE WHICH SO SOFTLY WARMS WITHOUT BURNING BUT THE BURNING
7055-87276-0035 THERE IS NOTHING IN LIFE WORTH HAVING COMPARED WITH IT FOR ALL ITS PAINS AND AGONIES IS THERE NOW IF YOU MUST LOVE SOMEBODY CONTINUED THE PRINCESS
7055-87276-0036 THERE IS LADY JANE BOLINGBROKE WHO IS BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD AND ADMIRES YOU AND I THINK COULD LEARN TO
7055-87276-0037 DON'T BELIEVE ONE WORD SHE SAYS SIR EDWIN CRIED LADY JANE IF YOU DO I NEVER WILL LIKE YOU THE EMPHASIS ON THE WILL HELD OUT SUCH INVOLUNTARY PROMISE IN CASE I DID NOT BELIEVE THE PRINCESS
7055-87276-0038 THAT I AT ONCE PROTESTED TOTAL WANT OF FAITH IN A SINGLE SYLLABLE SHE HAD SAID ABOUT HER AND VOWED THAT I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE TRUE THAT I DARED NOT HOPE FOR SUCH HAPPINESS YOU SEE
7055-87276-0039 AND THEREFORE I HAD NOT BEEN MUCH HURT IN MARY'S CASE I HAD SUFFERED MERELY A TOUCH OF THE GENERAL EPIDEMIC NOT THE LINGERING CHRONIC DISEASE THAT KILLS
7055-87276-0040 THEN I KNEW THAT THE BEST CURE FOR THE STING WHICH LIES IN A LUCKLESS LOVE IS TO LOVE ELSEWHERE AND JANE AS SHE STOOD THERE SO PETITE SO BLUSHING AND SO FAIR STRUCK ME AS QUITE THE MOST PLEASING ANTIDOTE I COULD POSSIBLY FIND
7055-87276-0041 IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT FOR ME ONE OF THOSE WHICH COME TO A MAN NOW AND THEN AND FOR WHICH HE THANKS HIS WITS IN EVERY HOUR OF HIS AFTER LIFE
7055-87276-0042 BUT THE WINNING OF JANE WAS NOT SO EASY A MATTER AS MY VANITY HAD PROMPTED ME TO THINK I STARTED WITH A HANDICAP
7055-87276-0043 AND I HAD TO UNDO ALL THAT BEFORE I COULD DO ANYTHING ELSE
7055-87276-0044 BUT FIND A CONTINUAL TENDENCY ON THE PART OF MY OWN STORY TO INTRUDE FOR EVERY MAN IS A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE TO HIMSELF I SHALL HOWEVER TRY TO KEEP IT OUT IN THE COURSE OF MY TALK WITH BRANDON
7055-87276-0045 I HAD AS I HAVE SAID TOLD HIM THE STORY OF MARY WITH SOME SLIGHT VARIATIONS AND COLORING OR RATHER DISCOLORING
7055-87276-0046 I TOLD HIM ALSO ABOUT JANE AND I GRIEVE AND BLUSH TO SAY EXPRESSED A CONFIDENCE IN THAT DIRECTION I LITTLE FELT IT HAD BEEN PERHAPS A YEAR SINCE MY ADVENTURE WITH MARY
7055-87276-0047 AND I HAD TAKEN ALL THAT TIME TRYING TO CONVINCE JANE THAT I DID NOT MEAN A WORD I HAD SAID TO HER MISTRESS
7055-87276-0048 AND THAT I WAS VERY EARNEST IN EVERYTHING I SAID TO HER BUT JANE'S EARS WOULD HAVE HEARD JUST AS MUCH HAD THEY BEEN THE PAIR OF BEAUTIFUL LITTLE SHELLS THEY SO MUCH RESEMBLED THIS TROUBLED ME A GREAT DEAL
7055-87276-0049 AND THE BEST I COULD HOPE WAS THAT SHE HELD ME ON PROBATION ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY MARY CAME HOME TO GREENWICH BRANDON ASKED WHO AND WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS WONDERFUL MARY I HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT
7055-87276-0050 THEY SAY SHE IS COMING HOME TO DAY AND THE COURT SEEMS TO HAVE GONE MAD ABOUT IT I HEAR NOTHING BUT MARY IS COMING MARY IS COMING MARY MARY FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT
7055-87276-0051 THEY SAY BUCKINGHAM IS BESIDE HIMSELF FOR LOVE OF HER HE HAS A WIFE AT HOME IF I AM RIGHT AND IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE HER FATHER IS HE NOT I ASSENTED AND BRANDON CONTINUED
7055-87276-0052 THE MEN OF THE COURT MUST BE POOR CREATURES HE HAD MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT THE POWER OF WOMANHOOD THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH BUT YOU KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS I DO WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE HER I ANSWERED
7055-87276-0053 AND YOU WILL BE ONE OF THEM ALSO I FLATTER YOU BY GIVING YOU ONE HOUR WITH HER TO BE HEELS OVER HEAD IN LOVE WITH AN ORDINARY MAN IT TAKES ONE SIXTIETH OF THAT TIME
7055-87276-0054 SO YOU SEE I PAY A COMPLIMENT TO YOUR STRENGTH OF MIND NONSENSE BROKE IN BRANDON DO YOU THINK I LEFT ALL MY WITS DOWN IN SUFFOLK WHY MAN SHE IS THE SISTER OF THE KING AND IS SOUGHT BY KINGS AND EMPERORS
7055-87276-0055 I MIGHT AS WELL FALL IN LOVE WITH A TWINKLING STAR THEN BESIDES MY HEART IS NOT ON MY SLEEVE YOU MUST THINK ME A FOOL A POOR ENERVATED SIMPERING FOOL
7055-87276-0056 LIKE LIKE WELL LIKE ONE OF THOSE NOBLES OF ENGLAND DON'T PUT ME DOWN WITH THEM CASKODEN IF YOU WOULD REMAIN MY FRIEND WE BOTH LAUGHED AT THIS SORT OF TALK WHICH WAS A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF THE TIME
7055-87276-0057 FOR A NOBLE THOUGH AN IDIOT TO THE MOST OF ENGLAND WAS A NOBLE STILL GOD CREATED AND TO BE ADORED ANOTHER GREAT BOND OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN BRANDON AND MYSELF
7055-87276-0058 AND TOLERANCE OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT WE BELIEVED THAT THESE THINGS WOULD YET COME IN SPITE OF KINGCRAFT AND PRIESTCRAFT BUT WISELY KEPT OUR PET THEORIES TO OURSELVES
7055-87276-0059 THAT IS BETWEEN OURSELVES OF WHAT USE IS IT TO ARGUE THE EQUALITY OF HUMAN KIND TO A MAN WHO HONESTLY THINKS HE IS BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE OR TO ONE WHO REALLY BELIEVES THAT SOME ONE ELSE IS BETTER THAN HE
7055-87276-0060 AND WHY DISPUTE ABOUT THE VARIOUS WAYS OF SAVING ONE'S SOUL WHEN YOU ARE NOT EVEN SURE YOU HAVE A SOUL TO SAVE WHEN I OPEN MY MOUTH FOR PUBLIC UTTERANCE THE KING IS THE BEST MAN IN CHRISTENDOM
7055-87276-0061 AND HIS PREMIER PEER OF THE REALM THE NEXT BEST WHEN THE KING IS A CATHOLIC I GO TO MASS SINCE PRAISED BE THE LORD
7055-87276-0062 NOW WHEN MARY RETURNED THE WHOLE COURT REJOICED AND I WAS ANXIOUS FOR BRANDON TO MEET HER AND THAT THEY SHOULD BECOME FRIENDS THERE WOULD BE NO TROUBLE IN BRINGING THIS MEETING ABOUT SINCE AS YOU KNOW
7055-87276-0063 I WAS UPON TERMS OF INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP WITH MARY AND WAS THE AVOWED AND AS I THOUGHT AT LEAST HOPED ALL BUT ACCEPTED LOVER OF HER FIRST LADY IN WAITING AND DEAREST FRIEND LADY JANE BOLINGBROKE
7055-87276-0064 BRANDON IT IS TRUE WAS NOT NOBLE NOT EVEN AN ENGLISH KNIGHT WHILE I WAS BOTH KNIGHTED AND NOBLE BUT HE WAS OF AS OLD A FAMILY AS ENGLAND BOASTED AND NEAR OF KIN TO SOME OF THE BEST BLOOD OF THE LAND
7055-87276-0065 THE MEETING CAME ABOUT SOONER THAN I EXPECTED AND WAS VERY NEAR A FAILURE IT WAS ON THE SECOND MORNING AFTER MARY'S ARRIVAL AT GREENWICH BRANDON AND I WERE WALKING IN THE PALACE PARK WHEN WE MET JANE
7055-87276-0066 AND I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THESE MY TWO BEST LOVED FRIENDS ACQUAINTED HOW DO YOU DO MASTER BRANDON SAID LADY JANE HOLDING OUT HER PLUMP LITTLE HAND SO WHITE AND SOFT AND DEAR TO ME
7055-87276-0067 I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOU THE LAST DAY OR SO FROM SIR EDWIN BUT HAD BEGUN TO FEAR HE WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE ME THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING YOU I HOPE I MAY SEE YOU OFTEN NOW AND THAT I MAY PRESENT YOU TO MY MISTRESS WITH THIS
7055-87276-0068 HER EYES BRIGHT AS OVERGROWN DEW DROPS TWINKLED WITH A MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE SMILE AS IF TO SAY AH ANOTHER LARGE HANDSOME FELLOW TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF BRANDON ACQUIESCED IN THE WISH SHE HAD MADE
7055-87276-0069 AND AFTER THE INTERCHANGE OF A FEW WORDS JANE SAID HER MISTRESS WAS WAITING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GROUNDS AND THAT SHE MUST GO SHE THEN RAN OFF WITH A LAUGH AND A COURTESY
7055-87276-0070 AND WAS SOON LOST TO SIGHT BEHIND THE SHRUBBERY AT THE TURNING OF THE WALK IN A SHORT TIME WE CAME TO A SUMMER HOUSE NEAR THE MARBLE BOAT LANDING
7055-87276-0071 WHERE WE FOUND THE QUEEN AND SOME OF HER LADIES AWAITING THE REST OF THEIR PARTY FOR A TRIP DOWN THE RIVER WHICH HAD BEEN PLANNED THE DAY BEFORE BRANDON WAS KNOWN TO THE QUEEN AND SEVERAL OF THE LADIES ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT BEEN FORMALLY PRESENTED AT AN AUDIENCE
7055-87276-0072 SOCIALLY WHICH GOES WITH A FORMAL PRESENTATION THE QUEEN SEEING US SENT ME OFF TO BRING THE KING AFTER I HAD GONE SHE ASKED IF ANY ONE HAD SEEN THE PRINCESS MARY
7055-87276-0073 AND BRANDON TOLD HER LADY JANE HAD SAID SHE WAS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GROUNDS THEREUPON HER MAJESTY ASKED BRANDON TO FIND THE PRINCESS AND TO SAY THAT SHE WAS WANTED
7055-87276-0074 BRANDON STARTED OFF AND SOON FOUND A BEVY OF GIRLS SITTING ON SOME BENCHES UNDER A SPREADING OAK WEAVING SPRING FLOWERS HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE PRINCESS SO COULD NOT POSITIVELY KNOW HER
7055-87276-0075 ALL THAT HE HAD HEARD OF HER WONDERFUL POWER OVER MEN
7055-87276-0076 HE WAS WRONG IN THIS BECAUSE MARY WAS NOT A COQUETTE IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD AND DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ATTRACT MEN EXCEPT TO BE SO BEAUTIFUL SWEET AND WINNING THAT THEY COULD NOT LET HER ALONE
7055-87276-0077 FOR ALL OF WHICH SURELY THE PRINCE OF FAULT FINDERS HIMSELF COULD IN NO WAY BLAME HER SHE COULD NOT HELP THAT GOD HAD SEEN FIT TO MAKE HER THE FAIREST BEING ON EARTH
7055-87276-0078 AND THE RESPONSIBILITY WOULD HAVE TO LIE WHERE IT BELONGED WITH GOD MARY WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT HER ATTRACTIVENESS WAS NOT A MATTER OF VOLITION OR INTENTION ON HER PART SHE WAS TOO YOUNG FOR DELIBERATE SNARE SETTING
7055-87276-0079 THOUGH IT OFTEN BEGINS VERY EARLY IN LIFE AND MADE NO EFFORT TO ATTRACT MEN MAN'S LOVE WAS TOO CHEAP A THING FOR HER TO STRIVE FOR AND I AM SURE IN HER HEART
7055-87276-0080 THAT IS UNTIL THE RIGHT ONE SHOULD COME THE RIGHT ONE IS ALWAYS ON HIS WAY AND FIRST OR LAST IS SURE TO COME TO EVERY WOMAN SOMETIMES ALAS TOO LATE
7055-87276-0081 AND WHEN HE COMES BE IT LATE OR EARLY SHE CROWNS HIM EVEN THOUGH HE BE A LONG EARED ASS
7055-87276-0082 ELSE THERE WERE FEWER CORONATIONS SO BRANDON STIRRED THIS ANTAGONISM AND DETERMINED NOT TO SEE HER MANIFOLD PERFECTIONS WHICH HE FELT SURE WERE EXAGGERATED
7055-87276-0083 BUT TO TREAT HER AS HE WOULD THE QUEEN WHO WAS BLACK AND LEATHERY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN A SATYR WITH ALL RESPECT DUE TO HER RANK BUT WITH HIS OWN OPINION OF HER NEVERTHELESS SAFELY STORED AWAY IN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
7055-87276-0084 COMING UP TO THE GROUP BRANDON TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND WITH A GRACEFUL LITTLE BOW THAT LET THE CURLS FALL AROUND HIS FACE ASKED HAVE I THE HONOR TO FIND THE PRINCESS MARY AMONG THESE LADIES MARY
7055-87276-0085 WHO I KNOW YOU WILL AT ONCE SAY WAS THOROUGHLY SPOILED WITHOUT TURNING HER FACE TOWARD HIM REPLIED IS THE PRINCESS MARY A PERSON OF SO LITTLE CONSEQUENCE ABOUT THE COURT THAT SHE IS NOT KNOWN TO A MIGHTY CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD
7055-87276-0086 HE WORE HIS GUARDSMAN'S DOUBLET AND SHE KNEW HIS RANK BY HIS UNIFORM SHE HAD NOT NOTICED HIS FACE QUICK AS A FLASH CAME THE ANSWER I CAN NOT SAY OF WHAT CONSEQUENCE THE PRINCESS MARY IS ABOUT THE COURT
7055-87276-0087 IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO DETERMINE SUCH MATTERS I AM SURE HOWEVER SHE IS NOT HERE FOR I DOUBT NOT SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A GENTLE ANSWER TO A MESSAGE FROM THE QUEEN I SHALL CONTINUE MY SEARCH WITH THIS
7055-87276-0088 HE TURNED TO LEAVE AND THE LADIES INCLUDING JANE WHO WAS THERE AND SAW IT ALL AND TOLD ME OF IT AWAITED THE BOLT THEY KNEW WOULD COME FOR THEY SAW THE LIGHTNING GATHERING IN MARY'S EYES
7055-87276-0089 MARY SPRANG TO HER FEET WITH AN ANGRY FLUSH IN HER FACE EXCLAIMING INSOLENT FELLOW I AM THE PRINCESS MARY IF YOU HAVE A MESSAGE DELIVER IT AND BE GONE
7055-87276-0090 YOU MAY BE SURE THIS SORT OF TREATMENT WAS SUCH AS THE COOL HEADED DARING BRANDON WOULD REPAY WITH USURY SO TURNING UPON HIS HEEL AND ALMOST PRESENTING HIS BACK TO MARY HE SPOKE TO LADY JANE
7055-87276-0091 WILL YOUR LADYSHIP SAY TO HER HIGHNESS THAT HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN AWAITS HER COMING AT THE MARBLE LANDING NO NEED TO REPEAT THE MESSAGE JANE CRIED MARY
7055-87276-0092 THEN TURNING TO BRANDON
7055-87276-0093 I BEG YOU TO SAY TO THE QUEEN THAT I SHALL BE WITH HER PRESENTLY
