6609-111351-0000 INDEED IT WAS TYPICAL OF THESE FRENCH HIGHLANDS IMAGINE A COTTAGE OF TWO STORIES WITH A BENCH BEFORE THE DOOR THE STABLE AND KITCHEN IN A SUITE SO THAT MODESTINE AND I COULD HEAR EACH OTHER DINING FURNITURE OF THE PLAINEST EARTHEN FLOORS
6609-111351-0001 A SINGLE BED CHAMBER FOR TRAVELLERS AND THAT WITHOUT ANY CONVENIENCE BUT BEDS IN THE KITCHEN COOKING AND EATING GO FORWARD SIDE BY SIDE AND THE FAMILY SLEEP AT NIGHT ANY ONE WHO HAS A FANCY TO WASH MUST DO SO IN PUBLIC AT THE COMMON TABLE
6609-111351-0002 THE FOOD IS SOMETIMES SPARE HARD FISH AND OMELETTE HAVE BEEN MY PORTION MORE THAN ONCE THE WINE IS OF THE SMALLEST THE BRANDY ABOMINABLE TO MAN AND THE VISIT OF A FAT SOW
6609-111351-0003 GROUTING UNDER THE TABLE AND RUBBING AGAINST YOUR LEGS IS NO IMPOSSIBLE ACCOMPANIMENT TO DINNER BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE INN IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN SHOW THEMSELVES FRIENDLY AND CONSIDERATE AS SOON AS YOU CROSS THE DOORS YOU CEASE TO BE A STRANGER
6609-111351-0004 AND ALTHOUGH THESE PEASANTRY ARE RUDE AND FORBIDDING ON THE HIGHWAY THEY SHOW A TINCTURE OF KIND BREEDING WHEN YOU SHARE THEIR HEARTH AT BOUCHET FOR INSTANCE I UNCORKED MY BOTTLE OF BEAUJOLAIS AND ASKED THE HOST TO JOIN ME HE WOULD TAKE BUT LITTLE
6609-111351-0005 I AM AN AMATEUR OF SUCH WINE DO YOU SEE HE SAID AND I AM CAPABLE OF LEAVING YOU NOT ENOUGH IN THESE HEDGE INNS THE TRAVELLER IS EXPECTED TO EAT WITH HIS OWN KNIFE UNLESS HE ASK NO OTHER WILL BE SUPPLIED
6609-111351-0006 WITH A GLASS A WHANG OF BREAD AND AN IRON FORK THE TABLE IS COMPLETELY LAID MY KNIFE WAS CORDIALLY ADMIRED BY THE LANDLORD OF BOUCHET AND THE SPRING FILLED HIM WITH WONDER I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED THAT HE SAID
6609-111351-0007 I WOULD BET HE ADDED WEIGHING IT IN HIS HAND THAT THIS COST YOU NOT LESS THAN FIVE FRANCS WHEN I TOLD HIM IT HAD COST ME TWENTY HIS JAW DROPPED HE WAS A MILD HANDSOME SENSIBLE FRIENDLY OLD MAN ASTONISHINGLY IGNORANT
6609-111351-0008 HIS WIFE WHO WAS NOT SO PLEASANT IN HER MANNERS KNEW HOW TO READ ALTHOUGH I DO NOT SUPPOSE SHE EVER DID SO SHE HAD A SHARE OF BRAINS AND SPOKE WITH A CUTTING EMPHASIS LIKE ONE WHO RULED THE ROAST
6609-111351-0009 MY MAN KNOWS NOTHING SHE SAID WITH AN ANGRY NOD HE IS LIKE THE BEASTS AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN SIGNIFIED ACQUIESCENCE WITH HIS HEAD THERE WAS NO CONTEMPT ON HER PART AND NO SHAME ON HIS THE FACTS WERE ACCEPTED LOYALLY AND NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
6609-111351-0010 I WAS TIGHTLY CROSS EXAMINED ABOUT MY JOURNEY AND THE LADY UNDERSTOOD IN A MOMENT AND SKETCHED OUT WHAT I SHOULD PUT INTO MY BOOK WHEN I GOT HOME WHETHER PEOPLE HARVEST OR NOT IN SUCH OR SUCH A PLACE IF THERE WERE FORESTS STUDIES OF MANNERS
6609-111351-0011 THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE AND ALL THAT AND SHE INTERROGATED ME WITH A LOOK IT IS JUST THAT SAID I
6609-111351-0012 I UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE BOTH MUCH INTERESTED BY THE STORY OF MY MISADVENTURES IN THE MORNING SAID THE HUSBAND I WILL MAKE YOU SOMETHING BETTER THAN YOUR CANE SUCH A BEAST AS THAT FEELS NOTHING IT IS IN THE PROVERB DUR COMME UN ANE
6609-111351-0013 YOU MIGHT BEAT HER INSENSIBLE WITH A CUDGEL AND YET YOU WOULD ARRIVE NOWHERE SOMETHING BETTER I LITTLE KNEW WHAT HE WAS OFFERING
6609-111351-0014 IN THE ACT OF MOUNTING INTO THE OTHER THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE SORT AND IF I AM ALWAYS TO FEEL EQUALLY SILLY AND EXTRANEOUS I PRAY GOD IT BE MY LAST AS WELL
6609-111351-0015 I KEPT MY EYES TO MYSELF AND KNOW NOTHING OF THE WOMAN EXCEPT THAT SHE HAD BEAUTIFUL ARMS AND SEEMED NO WHIT EMBARRASSED BY MY APPEARANCE AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SITUATION WAS MORE TRYING TO ME THAN TO THE PAIR
6609-111351-0016 A PAIR KEEP EACH OTHER IN COUNTENANCE IT IS THE SINGLE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS TO BLUSH BUT I COULD NOT HELP ATTRIBUTING MY SENTIMENTS TO THE HUSBAND AND SOUGHT TO CONCILIATE HIS TOLERANCE WITH A CUP OF BRANDY FROM MY FLASK HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS A COOPER OF ALAIS
6609-111351-0017 TRAVELLING TO SAINT ETIENNE IN SEARCH OF WORK AND THAT IN HIS SPARE MOMENTS HE FOLLOWED THE FATAL CALLING OF A MAKER OF MATCHES ME HE READILY ENOUGH DIVINED TO BE A BRANDY MERCHANT I WAS UP FIRST IN THE MORNING MONDAY SEPTEMBER TWENTY THIRD
6609-111351-0018 AND HASTENED MY TOILETTE GUILTILY SO AS TO LEAVE A CLEAR FIELD FOR MADAM THE COOPER'S WIFE I DRANK A BOWL OF MILK AND SET OFF TO EXPLORE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BOUCHET IT WAS PERISHING COLD A GREY WINDY WINTRY MORNING
6609-111351-0019 MISTY CLOUDS FLEW FAST AND LOW THE WIND PIPED OVER THE NAKED PLATFORM
6609-111351-0020 AND THE EASTERN HILLS WHERE THE SKY STILL WORE THE ORANGE OF THE DAWN IT WAS FIVE IN THE MORNING AND FOUR THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND I HAD TO BURY MY HANDS IN MY POCKETS AND TROT PEOPLE WERE TROOPING OUT TO THE LABOURS OF THE FIELD BY TWOS AND THREES
6609-111351-0021 AND ALL TURNED ROUND TO STARE UPON THE STRANGER I HAD SEEN THEM COMING BACK LAST NIGHT I SAW THEM GOING AFIELD AGAIN AND THERE WAS THE LIFE OF BOUCHET IN A NUTSHELL
6609-111351-0022 WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE INN FOR A BIT OF BREAKFAST THE LANDLADY WAS IN THE KITCHEN COMBING OUT HER DAUGHTER'S HAIR AND I MADE HER MY COMPLIMENTS UPON ITS BEAUTY OH NO SAID THE MOTHER
6609-111351-0023 THUS DOES A WISE PEASANTRY CONSOLE ITSELF UNDER ADVERSE PHYSICAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND BY A STARTLING DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THE DEFECTS OF THE MAJORITY DECIDE THE TYPE OF BEAUTY AND WHERE SAID I IS MONSIEUR
6609-111351-0024 THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE IS UPSTAIRS SHE ANSWERED MAKING YOU A GOAD
6609-111351-0025 WHO INTRODUCED ME TO THEIR USE THIS PLAIN WAND WITH AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH OF PIN WAS INDEED A SCEPTRE WHEN HE PUT IT IN MY HANDS THENCEFORWARD MODESTINE WAS MY SLAVE
6609-111351-0026 A PRICK AND SHE PASSED THE MOST INVITING STABLE DOOR A PRICK AND SHE BROKE FORTH INTO A GALLANT LITTLE TROTLET THAT DEVOURED THE MILES
6609-111351-0027 IT WAS NOT A REMARKABLE SPEED WHEN ALL WAS SAID AND WE TOOK FOUR HOURS TO COVER TEN MILES AT THE BEST OF IT BUT WHAT A HEAVENLY CHANGE SINCE YESTERDAY NO MORE WIELDING OF THE UGLY CUDGEL NO MORE FLAILING WITH AN ACHING ARM NO MORE BROADSWORD EXERCISE
6609-111351-0028 AND WHAT ALTHOUGH NOW AND THEN A DROP OF BLOOD SHOULD APPEAR ON MODESTINE'S MOUSE COLOURED WEDGE LIKE RUMP I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED IT OTHERWISE INDEED BUT YESTERDAY'S EXPLOITS HAD PURGED MY HEART OF ALL HUMANITY THE PERVERSE LITTLE DEVIL
6609-111351-0029 SINCE SHE WOULD NOT BE TAKEN WITH KINDNESS MUST EVEN GO WITH PRICKING IT WAS BLEAK AND BITTER COLD AND EXCEPT A CAVALCADE OF STRIDE LEGGED LADIES AND A PAIR OF POST RUNNERS THE ROAD WAS DEAD SOLITARY ALL THE WAY TO PRADELLES
6609-111351-0030 I SCARCE REMEMBER AN INCIDENT BUT ONE A HANDSOME FOAL WITH A BELL ABOUT HIS NECK CAME CHARGING UP TO US UPON A STRETCH OF COMMON SNIFFED THE AIR MARTIALLY AS ONE ABOUT TO DO GREAT DEEDS AND SUDDENLY THINKING OTHERWISE IN HIS GREEN YOUNG HEART
6609-111351-0031 PUT ABOUT AND GALLOPED OFF AS HE HAD COME THE BELL TINKLING IN THE WIND FOR A LONG WHILE AFTERWARDS I SAW HIS NOBLE ATTITUDE AS HE DREW UP AND HEARD THE NOTE OF HIS BELL AND WHEN I STRUCK THE HIGH ROAD THE SONG OF THE TELEGRAPH WIRES SEEMED TO CONTINUE THE SAME MUSIC
6609-111351-0032 PRADELLES STANDS ON A HILLSIDE HIGH ABOVE THE ALLIER SURROUNDED BY RICH MEADOWS THEY WERE CUTTING AFTERMATH ON ALL SIDES WHICH GAVE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THIS GUSTY AUTUMN MORNING AN UNTIMELY SMELL OF HAY
6609-111351-0033 ON THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE ALLIER THE LAND KEPT MOUNTING FOR MILES TO THE HORIZON A TANNED AND SALLOW AUTUMN LANDSCAPE WITH BLACK BLOTS OF FIR WOOD AND WHITE ROADS WANDERING THROUGH THE HILLS OVER ALL THIS THE CLOUDS SHED A UNIFORM AND PURPLISH SHADOW
6609-111351-0034 SAD AND SOMEWHAT MENACING EXAGGERATING HEIGHT AND DISTANCE AND THROWING INTO STILL HIGHER RELIEF THE TWISTED RIBBONS OF THE HIGHWAY IT WAS A CHEERLESS PROSPECT BUT ONE STIMULATING TO A TRAVELLER
6609-111351-0035 AND ALL THAT I BEHELD LAY IN ANOTHER COUNTY
6609-111351-0036 MOUNTAINOUS UNCULTIVATED AND BUT RECENTLY DISFORESTED FROM TERROR OF THE WOLVES WOLVES ALAS LIKE BANDITS SEEM TO FLEE THE TRAVELER'S ADVANCE AND YOU MAY TRUDGE THROUGH ALL OUR COMFORTABLE EUROPE AND NOT MEET WITH AN ADVENTURE WORTH THE NAME
6609-111351-0037 BUT HERE IF ANYWHERE A MAN WAS ON THE FRONTIERS OF HOPE FOR THIS WAS THE LAND OF THE EVER MEMORABLE BEAST THE NAPOLEON BONAPARTE OF WOLVES WHAT A CAREER WAS HIS
6609-111351-0038 HE PURSUED ARMED HORSEMEN HE HAS BEEN SEEN AT BROAD NOONDAY CHASING A POST CHAISE AND OUTRIDER ALONG THE KING'S HIGH ROAD AND CHAISE AND OUTRIDER FLEEING BEFORE HIM AT THE GALLOP HE WAS PLACARDED LIKE A POLITICAL OFFENDER
6609-111351-0039 AND TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WERE OFFERED FOR HIS HEAD AND YET WHEN HE WAS SHOT AND SENT TO VERSAILLES BEHOLD A COMMON WOLF AND EVEN SMALL FOR THAT THOUGH I COULD REACH FROM POLE TO POLE SANG ALEXANDER POPE
6609-111351-0040 THE LITTLE CORPORAL SHOOK EUROPE AND IF ALL WOLVES HAD BEEN AS THIS WOLF THEY WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE HISTORY OF MAN
6609-111351-0041 HAS MADE HIM THE HERO OF A NOVEL WHICH I HAVE READ AND DO NOT WISH TO READ AGAIN I HURRIED OVER MY LUNCH AND WAS PROOF AGAINST THE LANDLADY'S DESIRE THAT I SHOULD VISIT OUR LADY OF PRADELLES WHO PERFORMED MANY MIRACLES ALTHOUGH SHE WAS OF WOOD
6609-111351-0042 ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD IN BIG DUSTY FIELDS FARMERS WERE PREPARING FOR NEXT SPRING EVERY FIFTY YARDS A YOKE OF GREAT NECKED STOLID OXEN WERE PATIENTLY HALING AT THE PLOUGH
6609-111351-0043 I SAW ONE OF THESE MILD FORMIDABLE SERVANTS OF THE GLEBE WHO TOOK A SUDDEN INTEREST IN MODESTINE AND ME THE FURROW DOWN WHICH HE WAS JOURNEYING LAY AT AN ANGLE TO THE ROAD AND HIS HEAD WAS SOLIDLY FIXED TO THE YOKE
6609-111351-0044 LIKE THOSE OF CARYATIDES BELOW A PONDEROUS CORNICE BUT HE SCREWED ROUND HIS BIG HONEST EYES AND FOLLOWED US WITH A RUMINATING LOOK UNTIL HIS MASTER BADE HIM TURN THE PLOUGH AND PROCEED TO REASCEND THE FIELD
6609-111351-0045 FROM ALL THESE FURROWING PLOUGHSHARES FROM THE FEET OF OXEN FROM A LABOURER HERE AND THERE WHO WAS BREAKING THE DRY CLODS WITH A HOE THE WIND CARRIED AWAY A THIN DUST LIKE SO MUCH SMOKE IT WAS A FINE BUSY BREATHING RUSTIC LANDSCAPE AND AS I CONTINUED TO DESCEND
6609-111351-0046 I HAD CROSSED THE LOIRE THE DAY BEFORE
