7277-106404-0000 IN EVERY CONVERSATION THAT WE HEAR IN EVERY BOOK WE OPEN IN EVERY NEWSPAPER WE TAKE UP THE REIGNING IDEA RECURS AND THEN WE ARE SURPRISED AND EXCLAIM AT THESE WONDERFUL COINCIDENCES
7277-106404-0001 PROBABLY SUCH HAPPEN EVERY DAY BUT PASS UNOBSERVED WHEN THE MIND IS NOT INTENT UPON SIMILAR IDEAS OR EXCITED BY ANY STRONG ANALOGOUS FEELING
7277-106404-0002 WHEN THE LEARNED SIR THOMAS BROWNE WAS WRITING HIS ESSAY ON THE GARDENS OF CYRUS HIS IMAGINATION WAS SO POSSESSED BY THE IDEA OF A QUINCUNX THAT HE IS SAID TO HAVE SEEN A QUINCUNX IN EVERY OBJECT IN NATURE
7277-106404-0003 IN THE SAME MANNER AFTER A JEW HAD ONCE MADE AN IMPRESSION ON MY IMAGINATION A JEW APPEARED WHEREVER I WENT AS I WAS ON MY ROAD TO CAMBRIDGE TRAVELLING IN A STAGECOACH WHILST WE WERE SLOWLY GOING UP A STEEP HILL
7277-106404-0004 THERE WAS A PEDLAR'S BOX BESIDE HIM I THOUGHT I KNEW THE BOX I CALLED OUT AS WE WERE PASSING AND ASKED THE MAN WHAT'S THE MILE STONE HE LOOKED UP IT WAS POOR JACOB
7277-106404-0005 PUTTING HIS BOOK IN HIS POCKET TOOK UP HIS WELL KNOWN BOX AND WALKED ALONG WITH ME I BEGAN NOT BY ASKING ANY QUESTION ABOUT HIS FATHER THOUGH CURIOSITY WAS NOT QUITE DEAD WITHIN ME
7277-106404-0006 HE SAID THAT IF I HAD ANY CURIOSITY ABOUT IT HE COULD LEND ME A TRANSLATION WHICH HE HAD IN HIS PACK AND WITH ALL THE ALACRITY OF GOOD WILL HE SET DOWN THE BOX TO LOOK FOR THE BOOK NO DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF DON'T OPEN IT SAID I PUTTING MY HAND ON THE BOX
7277-106404-0007 INSTANTLY A SMILE AND A SIGH AND A LOOK OF INEFFABLE KINDNESS AND GRATITUDE FROM JACOB SHOWED ME THAT ALL THE PAST RUSHED UPON HIS HEART NOT TROUBLE MYSELF OH MASTER HARRINGTON SAID HE POOR JACOB IS NOT SO UNGRATEFUL AS THAT WOULD COME TO
7277-106404-0008 YOU'RE ONLY TOO GRATEFUL SAID I BUT WALK ON KEEP UP WITH ME AND TELL ME HOW YOUR AFFAIRS ARE GOING ON IN THE WORLD FOR I AM MUCH MORE INTERESTED ABOUT THEM THAN ABOUT THE LIFE OF THE CELEBRATED MENDELSSOHN IS THAT POSSIBLE SAID HIS LOOKS OF GENUINE SURPRISED SIMPLICITY
7277-106404-0009 HE THANKED ME AND TOLD ME THAT HE WAS MUCH BETTER IN THE WORLD THAN FORMERLY THAT A GOOD FRIEND OF HIS A LONDON JEWELLER OF HIS OWN TRIBE WHO HAD EMPLOYED HIM AS A PEDLAR AND HAD BEEN SATISFIED WITH HIS CONDUCT HAD ASSISTED HIM THROUGH HIS DIFFICULTIES
7277-106404-0010 HE SAID HE WAS GOING INTO ANOTHER AND A MUCH BETTER WAY OF BUSINESS HIS FRIEND THE LONDON JEWELLER HAD RECOMMENDED HIM TO HIS BROTHER A RICH ISRAELITE WHO HAD A VALUABLE STORE IN GIBRALTAR AND WHO WANTED A YOUNG MAN TO ASSIST HIM ON WHOM HE COULD ENTIRELY DEPEND
7277-106404-0011 JACOB WAS GOING OUT TO GIBRALTAR IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT WEEK AND NOW MISTER HARRINGTON SAID HE CHANGING HIS TONE AND SPEAKING WITH EFFORT AS IF HE WERE CONQUERING SOME INWARD FEELING NOW IT IS ALL OVER MISTER HARRINGTON AND THAT I AM LEAVING ENGLAND AND PERHAPS MAY NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN
7277-106404-0012 I WISH BEFORE I TAKE LEAVE OF YOU TO TELL YOU SIR WHO MY FATHER WAS WAS FOR HE IS NO MORE I DID NOT MAKE A MYSTERY OF HIS NAME MERELY TO EXCITE CURIOSITY AS SOME OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN THOUGHT NOR BECAUSE I WAS ASHAMED OF MY LOW BIRTH
7277-106404-0013 MY FATHER WAS SIMON THE OLD CLOTHES MAN
7277-106404-0014 I KNEW ALL THAT YOU SUFFERED IN YOUR CHILDHOOD ABOUT HIM AND I ONCE HEARD YOU SAY TO LORD MOWBRAY WHO WAS TAUNTING YOU WITH SOMETHING ABOUT OLD SIMON THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THAT KNOWN UPON ANY ACCOUNT TO YOUR SCHOOL FELLOWS FOR THAT THEY WOULD PLAGUE YOU FOR EVER
7277-106404-0015 THAT MISTER HARRINGTON WILL NOT HATE POOR JACOB THOUGH HE IS THE SON OF HE PAUSED I ASSURED HIM OF MY REGARD I ASSURED HIM THAT I HAD LONG SINCE GOT RID OF ALL THE FOOLISH PREJUDICES OF MY CHILDHOOD
7277-106404-0016 THANKING ME AGAIN FOR TAKING AS HE SAID SUCH A KIND INTEREST IN THE CONCERNS OF A POOR JEW LIKE HIM HE ADDED WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES THAT HE WISHED HE MIGHT SOME TIME SEE ME AGAIN THAT HE SHOULD TO THE LAST DAY OF HIS LIFE REMEMBER ME AND SHOULD PRAY FOR MY HEALTH AND HAPPINESS
7277-106404-0017 AND THAT HE WAS SORRY HE HAD NO WAY OF SHOWING ME HIS GRATITUDE AGAIN HE RECURRED TO HIS BOX AND WOULD OPEN IT TO SHOW ME THE TRANSLATION OF MENDELSSOHN'S LIFE OR IF THAT DID NOT INTEREST ME HE BEGGED OF ME TO TAKE MY CHOICE FROM AMONG A FEW BOOKS HE HAD WITH HIM
7277-106404-0018 HE SAID HE SHOULD BE THERE IN A FEW DAYS FOR THAT HE TOOK CAMBRIDGE IN HIS ROAD AND HE REJOICED THAT HE SHOULD SEE ME AGAIN I GAVE HIM A DIRECTION TO MY COLLEGE AND FOR HIS GRATIFICATION IN TRUTH MORE THAN FOR MY OWN I BORROWED THE MAGAZINE CONTAINING THE LIFE OF MENDELSSOHN
7277-106404-0019 WHICH HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO LEND ME WE HAD NOW REACHED THE COACH AT THE TOP OF THE HILL I GOT IN AND SAW JACOB TRUDGING AFTER ME FOR SOME TIME BUT AT THE FIRST TURN OF THE ROAD I LOST SIGHT OF HIM AND THEN AS MY TWO COMPANIONS IN THE COACH WERE NOT VERY ENTERTAINING
7277-106404-0020 MENDELSSOHN WAS A JEW BORN LIKE HIMSELF IN ABJECT POVERTY BUT BY PERSEVERANCE HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH INCREDIBLE DIFFICULTIES TO THE HIGHEST LITERARY REPUTATION AMONG THE MOST EMINENT MEN OF HIS COUNTRY AND OF HIS AGE AND OBTAINED THE NAME OF THE JEWISH SOCRATES
7277-106404-0021 IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS EARLY INTENSE AND MISAPPLIED APPLICATION IN HIS FIRST JEWISH SCHOOL HE WAS SEIZED AT TEN YEARS OLD WITH SOME DREADFUL NERVOUS DISEASE THIS INTERESTED ME AND I WENT ON WITH HIS HISTORY OF HIS LIFE I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE REMEMBERED NOTHING
7277-106404-0022 EXCEPT WHAT RELATED TO THE NERVOUS DISORDER BUT IT SO HAPPENED THAT SOON AFTER I HAD READ THIS LIFE I HAD OCCASION TO SPEAK OF IT AND IT WAS OF CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE IN INTRODUCING ME TO GOOD COMPANY AT CAMBRIDGE A FEW DAYS AFTER I ARRIVED THERE JACOB CALLED ON ME
7277-106404-0023 AND WHO IF I MAY BE BOLD ENOUGH TO SAY SO HAS BEEN PREPOSSESSED IN YOUR FAVOUR BY HEARING OF YOUR HUMANITY TO POOR JACOB TOUCHED AS I WAS BY HIS EAGERNESS TO BE OF USE TO ME I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT JACOB'S SIMPLICITY AND ENTHUSIASM
7277-106404-0024 WHEN HE PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN THAT THIS PERSON WITH WHOM HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO MAKE ME ACQUAINTED WAS A LEARNED RABBI WHO AT THIS TIME TAUGHT HEBREW TO SEVERAL OF THE GOWNSMEN OF CAMBRIDGE
7277-106404-0025 AND THE CONTRAST WAS STRIKING BETWEEN WHAT HE CONCEIVED MY FIRST OBJECTS AT CAMBRIDGE WOULD BE AND WHAT THEY REALLY WERE HOWEVER I THANKED HIM FOR HIS GOOD OPINION AND PROMISED TO MAKE MYSELF ACQUAINTED WITH HIS LEARNED COUNTRYMAN
7277-106404-0026 TO MAKE THE MATTER SECURE AS JACOB WAS TO LEAVE CAMBRIDGE THE NEXT DAY
7277-106404-0027 JACOB LEFT WITH ME A LETTER FOR HIM AND THE VERY PARCEL WHICH I HAD SEEN DIRECTED TO MISTER ISRAEL LYONS THESE I ENGAGED TO DELIVER WITH MY OWN HANDS JACOB DEPARTED SATISFIED HAPPY IN THE HOPE THAT HE HAD DONE ME A SERVICE AND SO IN FACT IT PROVED
7277-106404-0028 EVERY FATHER AND EVERY SON WHO HAS BEEN AT THE UNIVERSITY KNOWS HOW MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE COLLEGE COMPANIONS WITH WHOM A YOUNG MAN FIRST ASSOCIATES THERE ARE USUALLY TWO SETS IF HE SHOULD JOIN THE DISSIPATED SET IT IS ALL OVER WITH HIM HE LEARNS NOTHING
7277-106404-0029 HE ACQUIRES KNOWLEDGE AND A TASTE FOR KNOWLEDGE WITH ALL THE ARDOUR INSPIRED BY SYMPATHY AND EMULATION WITH ALL THE FACILITY AFFORDED BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND PUBLIC LECTURES THE COLLECTED AND COMBINED INFORMATION OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD HE PURSUES HIS STUDIES
7277-106404-0030 THE UNION OF MANY MINDS INTENT UPON THE SAME OBJECT
7277-106404-0031 IN A LITERARY MANUFACTORY WHEN I WENT TO DELIVER MY PACKET TO MISTER LYONS I WAS SURPRISED BY SEEING IN HIM A MAN AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM MY PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF A JEWISH RABBI I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GUESSED HIM TO BE EITHER A RABBI OR A JEW
7277-106404-0032 I THOUGHT I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND PRESENTED MY PACKET WITH SOME HESITATION READING ALOUD THE DIRECTION TO MISTER ISRAEL LYONS I AM THE MAN SIR SAID HE OUR HONEST FRIEND JACOB HAS DESCRIBED YOU SO WELL MISTER HARRINGTON MISTER WILLIAM HARRINGTON HARRINGTON
7277-106404-0033 YOU PERCEIVE THAT I AM WELL INFORMED THAT I FEEL AS IF I HAD HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING ACQUAINTED WITH YOU FOR SOME TIME
7277-106404-0034 AND MY NECESSARY ENGAGEMENTS DO NOT LEAVE AS MUCH TIME FOR MY PLEASURES AS I COULD WISH I PERCEIVED BY THE TONE OF HIS ADDRESS THAT THOUGH HE WAS A HEBREW TEACHER HE WAS PROUD OF SHOWING HIMSELF TO BE A MAN OF THE WORLD
7277-106404-0035 I FOUND HIM IN THE MIDST OF HIS HEBREW SCHOLARS AND MOREOVER WITH SOME OF THE BEST MATHEMATICIANS AND SOME OF THE FIRST LITERARY MEN IN CAMBRIDGE
7277-106404-0036 WHICH RECALLED TO MY MIND THE LIFE OF THIS GREAT MAN BY THE HELP OF THAT I HAD HAPPILY SOME IDEAS IN COMMON WITH THE LEARNED JEW AND WE ENTERED IMMEDIATELY INTO CONVERSATION MUCH TO OUR MUTUAL RELIEF AND DELIGHT
7277-106404-0037 DOCTOR JOHNSON IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS SPEAKING OF A FIRST VISIT FROM A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED TO HIS ACQUAINTANCE SAYS THAT THE INITIATORY CONVERSATION OF TWO STRANGERS IS SELDOM PLEASING OR INSTRUCTIVE
7277-106404-0038 BUT I AM SURE THAT I WAS BOTH PLEASED AND INSTRUCTED DURING THIS INITIATORY CONVERSATION AND MISTER LYONS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE OPPRESSED OR ENCUMBERED BY MY VISIT I FOUND BY HIS CONVERSATION
7277-106404-0039 AND THOUGH HE HAD WRITTEN A TREATISE ON FLUXIONS AND A WORK ON BOTANY YET HE WAS NOT A MERE MATHEMATICIAN
7277-106404-0040 IN DESPITE OF THE ASSERTION THAT HEBREW ROOTS ARE ALWAYS FOUND TO FLOURISH BEST ON BARREN GROUND
7277-106404-0041 THIS VISIT DETERMINED MY COURSE AND DECIDED ME AS TO THE SOCIETY WHICH I KEPT DURING THE THREE HAPPY AND PROFITABLE YEARS I AFTERWARDS SPENT AT CAMBRIDGE
7277-106404-0042 MISTER ISRAEL LYONS IS NOW NO MORE I HOPE IT IS NO DISRESPECT TO HIS MEMORY TO SAY THAT HE HAD HIS FOIBLES IT WAS NO SECRET AMONG OUR CONTEMPORARIES AT CAMBRIDGE THAT HE WAS LIKE TOO MANY OTHER MEN OF GENIUS A LITTLE DEFICIENT IN ECONOMY SHALL I SAY IT
7277-106404-0043 A LITTLE EXTRAVAGANT THE DIFFICULTIES INTO WHICH HE BROUGHT HIMSELF BY HIS IMPROVIDENCE WERE HOWEVER ALWAYS TO HIM MATTERS OF JEST AND RAILLERY AND OFTEN INDEED PROVED SUBJECTS OF TRIUMPH FOR HE WAS SURE TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF BY SOME OF HIS MANY TALENTS
7277-106404-0044 TO MARK THE EFFECT OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN CHANGING MY OWN PREPOSSESSIONS THE FAULTS OF ISRAEL LYONS WERE NOT OF THAT SPECIES WHICH I EXPECTED TO FIND IN A JEW PERHAPS HE WAS AWARE THAT THE HEBREW NATION IS IN GENERAL SUPPOSED TO BE TOO CAREFUL
7277-106404-0045 I WAS NEVER FOND OF MONEY OR REMARKABLY CAREFUL OF IT MYSELF BUT I ALWAYS KEPT OUT OF DEBT AND MY FATHER GAVE ME SUCH A LIBERAL ALLOWANCE THAT I HAD IT IN MY POWER TO ASSIST A FRIEND
7277-106404-0046 MISTER LYONS LIVELY DISPOSITION AND MANNERS TOOK OFF ALL THAT AWE WHICH I MIGHT HAVE FELT FOR HIS LEARNING AND GENIUS I MAY TRULY SAY THAT THESE THREE YEARS WHICH I SPENT AT CAMBRIDGE FIXED MY CHARACTER AND THE WHOLE TONE AND COLOUR OF MY FUTURE LIFE
7277-106404-0047 AND TO OFFER HIM MY GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS IN THE COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION I MENTIONED THE CHILDISH TERROR AND AVERSION WITH WHICH I HAD BEEN EARLY TAUGHT TO LOOK UPON A JEW I REJOICED THAT EVEN WHILE A SCHOOLBOY I HAD CONQUERED THIS FOOLISH PREJUDICE
