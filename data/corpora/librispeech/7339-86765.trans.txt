7339-86765-0005 THE FIRST THING NECESSARY TO RENDER AN ACT VALID IS
7339-86765-0006 NOW I CANNOT BE SURE OF THE APPROBATION OR DISAPPROBATION OF A CLIENT WHO CANNOT SPEAK AND AS THE OBJECT OF HIS DESIRE OR HIS REPUGNANCE CANNOT BE CLEARLY PROVED TO ME ON ACCOUNT OF HIS WANT OF SPEECH

7339-86765-0008 SIR SAID SHE THE LANGUAGE WHICH I SPEAK WITH MY GRANDFATHER MAY BE EASILY LEARNT AND I CAN TEACH YOU IN A FEW MINUTES TO UNDERSTAND IT ALMOST AS WELL AS I CAN MYSELF
7339-86765-0009 IN ORDER TO RENDER AN ACT VALID I MUST BE CERTAIN OF THE APPROBATION OR DISAPPROBATION OF MY CLIENT ILLNESS OF BODY WOULD NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE DEED BUT

7339-86765-0013 YOU HAVE HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER HAS BEEN SAYING SIR HAVE YOU ASKED THE NOTARY NOIRTIER CLOSED HIS EYES AND YOU APPROVE OF WHAT SHE SAID THAT IS TO SAY
7339-86765-0014 AND YOU DO NOT WISH ME TO GO AWAY WITHOUT FULFILLING YOUR ORIGINAL INTENTIONS THE OLD MAN WINKED VIOLENTLY WELL SIR SAID THE YOUNG GIRL DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW
7339-86765-0015 WITHOUT ANY DETRIMENT TO HIS MENTAL FACULTIES IT IS NOT EXACTLY THAT SIR SAID THE NOTARY WHICH MAKES ME UNEASY BUT THE DIFFICULTY WILL BE IN WORDING HIS THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS SO AS TO BE ABLE TO GET HIS ANSWERS

7339-86765-0020 VALENTINE NAMED ALL THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET UNTIL SHE CAME TO W AT THIS LETTER THE ELOQUENT EYE OF NOIRTIER GAVE HER NOTICE THAT SHE WAS TO STOP
7339-86765-0021 SAID THE NOTARY WAIT SAID VALENTINE AND TURNING TO HER GRANDFATHER SHE REPEATED WA
7339-86765-0022 WE WI THE OLD MAN STOPPED HER AT THE LAST SYLLABLE VALENTINE THEN TOOK THE DICTIONARY AND THE NOTARY WATCHED HER WHILE SHE TURNED OVER THE PAGES SHE PASSED HER FINGER SLOWLY DOWN THE COLUMNS AND WHEN SHE CAME TO THE WORD WILL

7339-86765-0024 TURNING TO M DE VILLEFORT YES SAID THE PROCUREUR AND I THINK THE WILL PROMISES TO BE YET MORE EXTRAORDINARY FOR I CANNOT SEE HOW IT IS TO BE DRAWN UP WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF VALENTINE
7339-86765-0025 AND SHE MAY PERHAPS BE CONSIDERED AS TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN ITS CONTENTS TO ALLOW OF HER BEING A SUITABLE INTERPRETER OF THE OBSCURE AND ILL DEFINED WISHES OF HER GRANDFATHER NO NO NO REPLIED THE EYE OF THE PARALYTIC
7339-86765-0026 WHAT SAID VILLEFORT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT VALENTINE IS NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR WILL NO SIR SAID THE NOTARY WHOSE INTEREST HAD BEEN GREATLY EXCITED AND WHO HAD
7339-86765-0027 HAS NOW BECOME QUITE EASY AND PRACTICABLE AND THIS MAY BE A PERFECTLY VALID WILL PROVIDED IT BE READ IN THE PRESENCE OF SEVEN WITNESSES APPROVED BY THE TESTATOR AND SEALED BY THE NOTARY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WITNESSES
7339-86765-0028 AS TO THE TIME IT WILL NOT REQUIRE VERY MUCH MORE THAN THE GENERALITY OF WILLS THERE ARE CERTAIN FORMS NECESSARY TO BE GONE THROUGH AND WHICH ARE ALWAYS THE SAME AS TO THE DETAILS
7339-86765-0029 THE GREATER PART WILL BE FURNISHED AFTERWARDS BY THE STATE IN WHICH WE FIND THE AFFAIRS OF THE TESTATOR
7339-86765-0030 CAN DOUBTLESS GIVE FULL INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT BUT BESIDES ALL THIS IN ORDER THAT THE INSTRUMENT MAY NOT BE CONTESTED I AM ANXIOUS TO GIVE IT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE AUTHENTICITY THEREFORE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL HELP ME
7339-86765-0031 AT THE READY INTERPRETATION OF HIS MEANING WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO THOUGHT VILLEFORT WHOSE POSITION DEMANDED MUCH RESERVE BUT WHO WAS LONGING TO KNOW WHAT HIS FATHER'S INTENTIONS WERE HE LEFT THE ROOM TO GIVE ORDERS FOR ANOTHER NOTARY TO BE SENT

7339-86765-0060 THERE WAS A PROFOUND SILENCE THE TWO NOTARIES WERE HOLDING A CONSULTATION AS TO THE BEST MEANS OF PROCEEDING WITH THE AFFAIR
7339-86765-0061 AND VILLEFORT WAS BITING HIS LIPS WITH VEXATION WHILE MADAME DE VILLEFORT COULD NOT SUCCEED IN REPRESSING AN INWARD FEELING OF JOY
7339-86765-0062 BUT SAID VILLEFORT WHO WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE I CONSIDER THAT I AM THE BEST JUDGE OF THE PROPRIETY OF THE MARRIAGE IN QUESTION I AM THE ONLY PERSON POSSESSING THE RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF MY DAUGHTER'S HAND

7339-86765-0069 WHAT DO YOU DECIDE ON SIR ASKED THE NOTARY OF VILLEFORT NOTHING SIR IT IS A RESOLUTION WHICH MY FATHER HAS TAKEN AND I KNOW HE NEVER ALTERS HIS MIND I AM QUITE RESIGNED
7339-86765-0070 THESE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WILL GO OUT OF THE FAMILY IN ORDER TO ENRICH SOME HOSPITAL BUT IT IS RIDICULOUS THUS TO YIELD TO THE CAPRICES OF AN OLD MAN AND I SHALL THEREFORE ACT ACCORDING TO MY CONSCIENCE
