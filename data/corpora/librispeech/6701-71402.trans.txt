6701-71402-0000 A HUNDRED THEORIES WERE AFLOAT ALL CENTERING ON THE ONE OBJECT TO FIND THE MURDERER FIND HIM OR HER AND SWING HIM OR HER TO THE NEAREST TREE WAS THE VERDICT OF MANY
6701-71402-0001 THE LAW IS ALL WELL ENOUGH BUT THIS DASTARDLY CRIME DEMANDS AN OBJECT LESSON CORONER JACK BUSBY WHO WAS A DEALER IN HORSES HAD NEVER HAD A MURDER CASE BEFORE
6701-71402-0002 HE REALIZED HIS IMPORTANCE AS HE RAN HITHER AND THITHER TO ARRANGE FOR THE INQUEST HE FELT THAT HIS OWN LITTLE OFFICE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO SMALL FOR THE OCCASION AND SO ARRANGED TO BRING OFF THE AFFAIR IN THE GENERAL COURTROOM THE PLACE WAS SOON CROWDED WITH PEOPLE
6701-71402-0003 AND ANOTHER CROWD GATHERED OUTSIDE THE HOUR FOR OPENING THE INQUEST WAS AT HAND AND THE MAJORITY OF THE WITNESSES WERE PRESENT THE CORONER SHORT FAT AND BALD HEADED LOOKED AROUND ANXIOUSLY AND THEN TURNED TO THE CHIEF OF POLICE WHO WAS NEAR AT HAND
