4085-11516-0004 ON THE CAKED LOWLAND OOZE BUT THOSE FAT SOLES WERE CLEVERLY FASHIONED TO HIDE A LONG KEEN KNIFE BLADE LIKE A DIRK I COULD LIFT A FOOT AND GET THE KNIFE OUT OF ITS HIDDEN COMPARTMENT WITH FAIR SPEED THIS I HAD IN ONE SHOE IN THE OTHER

4085-11516-0011 SHOULDERED MY BAG AND SEEMED NOT TO NOTICE THE EFFORT WE PASSED OCCASIONAL TUBE LIGHTS STRUNG ON POLES THEY ILLUMINED THE HEAVY ROUNDED CRAGS A TUMBLED REGION THIS SLOPE WHICH ONCE WAS THE OCEAN FLOOR TWENTY THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE SURFACE
4085-11516-0012 RIFTS WERE HERE LIKE GULLEYS
4085-11516-0013 AND THERE WERE CAVES AND CREVICES IN WHICH DEEP SEA FISH ONCE HAD LURKED FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO WE CLIMBED IT WAS PAST THE MIDNIGHT HOUR THE VILLAGE WAS ASLEEP WE ENTERED ITS OUTPOSTS THE HOUSES WERE SMALL STRUCTURES OF CLAY IN THE GLOOM
4085-11516-0014 THEY LOOKED LIKE DRAB LITTLE BEEHIVES SET IN UNPLANNED GROUPS WITH PATHS FOR STREETS WANDERING BETWEEN THEM THEN WE CAME TO A MORE PROSPEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD THE STREET WIDENED AND STRAIGHTENED THE CLAY HOUSES STILL WITH ROUNDED DOME LIKE TOPS STOOD BACK FROM THE ROAD
4085-11516-0015 THE WINDOWS AND DOORS WERE LIKE ROUND FINGER HOLES PLUGGED IN THE CLAY BY A GIANT HAND OCCASIONALLY THE WINDOWS DIMLY LIGHTED STARED LIKE SLEEPING GIANT EYES THERE WERE FLOWERS IN ALL THE MORE PRETENTIOUS PRIVATE GARDENS
4085-11516-0016 THEIR PERFUME HANGING IN THE HEAVY NIGHT AIR LAY ON THE VILLAGE MAKING ONE FORGET THE OVER CURTAIN OF STENCHING MIST DOWN BY THE SHORE OF THE NARES SEA
4085-11516-0017 THE STREET LINED IN ONE PLACE BY ARCHING GIANT FRONDS DROWSING AND NODDING OVERHEAD
4085-11516-0018 MUCH FURTHER HUGO NO WE ARE HERE HE TURNED ABRUPTLY INTO A GATEWAY
4085-11516-0019 THE NEWS OF MY COMING HAD PRECEDED ME A FRONT ROOM WAS LIGHTED MY HOST WAS WAITING
4085-11516-0020 HE VANISHED I FRONTED MY HOST THIS JACOB SPAWN STRANGE FATE THAT SHOULD HAVE LED ME TO SPAWN AND TO LITTLE JETTA SPAWN WAS A FAT BELLIED DUTCHMAN AS THE FIELD ATTENDANT HAD SAID
4085-11516-0021 A FELLOW OF PERHAPS FIFTY FIVE WITH SPARSE GRAY HAIR AND A HEAVY JOWLED SMOOTH SHAVED FACE FROM WHICH HIS SMALL EYES PEERED STOLIDLY AT ME HE LAID ASIDE A HUGE OLD FASHIONED CALABASH PIPE AND OFFERED A PUDGY HAND
4085-11516-0022 WELCOME YOUNG MAN TO NAREDA SELDOM DO WE SEE STRANGERS THE MEAL WHICH HE PRESENTLY COOKED AND SERVED ME HIMSELF WAS LAVISHLY DONE HE SPOKE GOOD ENGLISH BUT SLOWLY HEAVILY WITH THE GUTTURAL INTONATION OF HIS RACE

4085-11516-0024 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COOKERY OF THE HIGHLANDS THERE WAS A TABLE WITH ITS TUBE LIGHT THE CHAIRS HIS ELECTRON STOVE
4085-11516-0025 I RECALL THAT IT SEEMED TO ME A WOMAN'S HAND MUST BE HERE BUT I SAW NO WOMAN
4085-11516-0026 THE KITCHEN ADJOINED AN INTERIOR BACK GARDEN I COULD SEE IT THROUGH THE OPENED DOOR OVAL A DIM SPACE OF FLOWERS A LITTLE PATH TO A PERGOLA AN ADOBE FOUNTAIN
4085-11516-0027 IT WAS A SORT OF SPANISH PATIO OUT THERE PARTIALLY ENCLOSED BY THE WINGS OF THE HOUSE MOONLIGHT WAS STRUGGLING INTO IT AND AS I GAZED IDLY I THOUGHT I SAW A FIGURE LURKING SOMEONE WATCHING US
4085-11516-0028 I THOUGHT SO A SLIGHT HALF GROWN BOY
4085-11516-0029 MADE VISIBLE IN A PATCH OF MOONLIGHT AS HE MOVED AWAY AND ENTERED THE DARK OPPOSITE WING OF THE HOUSE I DID NOT SEE THE BOY'S FIGURE AGAIN AND
4085-11516-0030 IT WAS IN ANOTHER WING OF THE HOUSE IT HAD A WINDOW FACING THE FRONT AND A WINDOW AND DOOR BACK TO THIS SAME PATIO
4085-11516-0031 SLEEP WELL MEESTER GRANT MY BAG WAS HERE ON THE TABLE UNDER AN ELECTROLIER SHALL I CALL YOU YES I SAID EARLY HE LINGERED A MOMENT I WAS OPENING MY BAG I FLUNG IT WIDE UNDER HIS GAZE WELL
4085-11516-0032 GOOD NIGHT I SHALL BE VERY COMFORTABLE THANKS GOOD NIGHT HE SAID HE WENT OUT THE PATIO DOOR I WATCHED HIS FIGURE CROSS THE MOONLIT PATH AND ENTER THE KITCHEN THE NOISE OF HIS PUTTERING THERE SOUNDED FOR A TIME
4085-11516-0033 THEN THE LIGHT WENT OUT AND THE HOUSE AND GARDEN FELL INTO SILENCE I CLOSED MY DOORS THEY SEALED ON THE INSIDE AND I FASTENED THEM SECURELY THEN I FASTENED THE TRANSPARENT WINDOW PANES I DID NOT UNDRESS BUT LAY ON THE BED IN THE DARK I WAS TIRED
4085-11516-0034 I REALIZED IT NOW BUT SLEEP WOULD NOT COME I AM NO BELIEVER IN OCCULTISM BUT THERE ARE PREMONITIONS WHICH ONE CANNOT DENY IT SEEMED NOW AS I LAY THERE IN THE DARK THAT I HAD EVERY REASON TO BE PERTURBED YET I COULD NOT THINK WHY
4085-11516-0035 AND ADJUSTED THE WIRES AND DIAPHRAGMS OF THE ETHER WAVE MECHANISM WHEN IN PLACE IT WAS ALL CONCEALED UNDER MY SHIRT AS I SWITCHED IT ON THE ELECTRODES AGAINST MY FLESH TINGLED A LITTLE BUT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY SOUNDLESS AND ONE GETS USED TO THE TINGLE
4085-11516-0036 A SLIGHT NOISE FORCED ITSELF ON ME A SCRATCHING A TAP SOMETHING OUTSIDE MY WINDOW SPAWN COME BACK TO PEER IN AT ME I SLIPPED NOISELESSLY FROM THE BED THE SOUND HAD COME FROM THE WINDOW WHICH FACED THE PATIO
4085-11516-0037 THE ROOM OVER BY THE BED WAS WHOLLY DARK THE MOONLIGHT OUTSIDE SHOWED THE PATIO WINDOW AS A DIMLY ILLUMINED OVAL FOR A MOMENT I CROUCHED ON THE FLOOR BY THE BED NO SOUND THE SILENCE OF THE LOWLANDS IS AS HEAVY AND OPPRESSIVE AS ITS AIR
4085-11516-0038 I FELT AS THOUGH MY HEART WERE AUDIBLE I LIFTED MY FOOT EXTRACTED MY DIRK IT OPENED INTO A VERY BUSINESSLIKE STEEL BLADE OF A GOOD TWELVE INCH LENGTH I BARED THE BLADE
4085-11516-0039 THE CLICK OF IT LEAVING THE FLAT HOLLOW HANDLE SOUNDED LOUD IN THE STILLNESS OF THE ROOM A MOMENT
