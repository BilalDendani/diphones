6614-67846-0001 AND THAT THEY WOULD START EARLY ON SATURDAY MORNING SYLVIA REMEMBERING HER FORMER VISIT KNEW WELL HOW DELIGHTFUL THE DRIVE WOULD BE AND THINKING OF THE PLEASURE IN STORE QUITE FORGOT TO BE TROUBLED BY ELINOR MAYHEW'S HOSTILITY
6614-67846-0002 AT RECESS THE GIRLS USUALLY WALKED ABOUT IN THE GARDEN OR TOSSED A BALL BACK AND FORTH MISS ROSALIE WOULD SIT ON THE BROAD PIAZZA OVERLOOKING THE GARDEN HER FINGERS BUSY WITH SOME PIECE OF DELICATE EMBROIDERY TO DAY
6614-67846-0003 AS THEY FILED OUT AND DOWN THE STEPS ELINOR WHISPERED TO SEVERAL OF HER COMPANIONS AND SUDDENLY SYLVIA REALIZED THAT SHE WAS STANDING ALONE GRACE WAITE HAD LINGERED TO SPEAK TO MISS ROSALIE
6614-67846-0004 FLORA HAD BEEN EXCUSED JUST BEFORE RECESS AS HER BLACK MAMMY HAD ARRIVED WITH A NOTE FROM MISSUS HAYES THE OTHER GIRLS WERE GATHERED IN A LITTLE GROUP ABOUT ELINOR WHO WAS EVIDENTLY TELLING THEM SOMETHING OF GREAT INTEREST
6614-67846-0005 SYLVIA WALKED SLOWLY ALONG TOWARD A LITTLE SUMMER HOUSE WHERE MISS PATTEN SOMETIMES HAD LITTLE TEA PARTIES SHE HOPED GRACE WOULD NOT STAY LONG WITH MISS PATTEN THE OTHER GIRLS WERE BETWEEN SYLVIA AND THE ARBOR AND NONE OF THEM MOVED TO LET HER PASS
6614-67846-0006 NOR DID ANY OF THEM SPEAK TO HER AS SHE PAUSED WITH A WORD OF GREETING NOW GIRLS SHE HEARD ELINOR SAY AND THE OTHERS HALF UNDER THEIR BREATH BUT ONLY TOO DISTINCTLY FOR SYLVIA
6614-67846-0007 ELINOR MAYHEW STOOD ON THE STEPS YOU ARE JUST AS MUCH A YANKEE AS I AM AND YOU OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF IT DECLARED SYLVIA FACING THE OLDER GIRL HEAR THAT GIRLS CALLED ELINOR TO THE GROUP ABOUT HER
6614-67846-0008 THERE WAS A LITTLE ANGRY MURMUR FROM THE OTHERS DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT AGAIN MISS BOSTON CALLED MAY BAILEY WHO STOOD NEXT TO ELINOR SYLVIA WAS NOW THOROUGHLY ANGRY
6614-67846-0009 SHE KNEW OF NO REASON WHY THESE GIRLS SHOULD TREAT HER IN SO UNKIND A FASHION SHE FELT VERY DESOLATE AND UNHAPPY BUT SHE FACED THEM BRAVELY YANKEES YANKEES IT'S WHAT ALL AMERICANS ARE SHE DECLARED DEFIANTLY
6614-67846-0010 IN AN INSTANT THE LITTLE GIRLS WERE ALL ABOUT HER ELINOR MAYHEW WAS HOLDING HER HANDS AND THE OTHERS WERE PUSHING HER ALONG THE PATH TO THE SHORE THE THICK GROWING SHRUBS HID THEM FROM THE HOUSE SYLVIA DID NOT CRY OUT OR SPEAK
6614-67846-0011 SHE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID NOR DID SHE RESIST WE OUGHT TO MAKE HER TAKE IT BACK SAID MAY BAILEY AS ELINOR STOPPED AND THEY ALL STOOD IN A CLOSE GROUP ABOUT SYLVIA
6614-67846-0012 SHE MIGHT AS WELL LEARN THAT SOUTH CAROLINIANS WILL NOT BE INSULTED AND ELINOR LIFTED HER HEAD PROUDLY I WON'T TAKE IT BACK RETORTED SYLVIA AND YOU ARE THE ONES WHO WILL HAVE TO APOLOGIZE YES
6614-67846-0013 EVERY ONE OF YOU BEFORE I WILL EVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN HEAR THAT GIRLS
6614-67846-0014 SHE MEANS SHE WILL TELL MISS ROSALIE SAID ONE OF THE GIRLS I DON'T EITHER I CAN LOOK AFTER MY OWN AFFFAIRS RETORTED SYLVIA BRAVELY I'M NOT A TELL TALE
6614-67846-0015 GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES COMMANDED ELINOR TRYING TO PUSH THE LITTLE GIRL THERE'S THE BELL AND THEY ALL TURNED AND SCAMPERED BACK TO THE HOUSE LEAVING SYLVIA ON THE PATH
6614-67846-0016 FOR ELINOR HAD LET GO OF HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE HAD FALLEN FORWARD HER KNEES WERE HURT AND ONE OF HER HANDS WAS BRUISED BY THE FALL FOR A MOMENT SHE LAY SOBBING QUIETLY SHE WAS ANGRY AND MISERABLE
6614-67846-0017 SHE HAD BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH WHEN THE GIRLS HAD SEEMED TO THREATEN HER BUT NOW HER COURAGE WAS GONE SHE COULD NOT GO BACK TO THE SCHOOLROOM AND FACE ALL THOSE ENEMIES IF MISS ROSALIE CAME IN SEARCH OF HER SHE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST TELLING HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
6614-67846-0018 AND MISERABLE AND UNHAPPY AS SHE WAS SYLVIA RESOLVED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER TELL BUT ELINOR MAYHEW AND ALL THE REST OF THEM SHALL BE SORRY FOR THIS YES
6614-67846-0019 THEY SHALL SHE SOBBED AS SHE GOT TO HER FEET AND TURNED TOWARD THE SHORE SHE KNEW SHE MUST EITHER GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE SCHOOLROOM OR ELSE FIND A HIDING PLACE UNTIL THEY HAD CEASED TO SEARCH FOR HER THERE WAS A WALL AT THE FOOT OF THE GARDEN COVERED WITH FRAGRANT JESSAMINE AND MYRTLE
6614-67846-0020 IF SHE COULD ONLY GET OVER THAT WALL THOUGHT SYLVIA SHE WOULD BE SAFE SHE RAN SWIFTLY FORWARD AND BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE UP GRASPING THE STURDY VINES AND FINDING A FOOTHOLD ON SOME BIT OF ROUGH BRICK
6614-67846-0021 SHE REACHED THE TOP JUST AS SHE HEARD MISS ROSALIE'S SERVANT CALLING HER NAME SYLVIA LOOKED DOWN TO THE FURTHER SIDE THE VINES DROOPED OVER AND BELOW THE WALL A HIGH BANK OF SAND SLOPED TO THE SHORE HOLDING TIGHT TO THE VINES SHE SLID DOWN
6614-67846-0022 HITTING HER BRUISED KNEES AGAINST THE ROUGH SURFACE THE VINES CUT HER HANDS AND WHEN SHE TUMBLED INTO THE SAND HER DRESS WAS TORN AND SOILED HER PRETTY HAIR RIBBON WAS GONE AND HER ONCE WHITE STOCKINGS WERE GRIMY BESIDE THESE MISFORTUNES HER HANDS WERE BLEEDING
6614-67846-0023 NEVER IN ALL HER LIFE HAD SYLVIA BEEN SO WRETCHED SHE SAT QUITE STILL IN THE WARM SAND AND WONDERED WHAT SHE COULD DO IF SHE WENT HOME HER MOTHER WOULD INSIST UPON AN EXPLANATION OF HER UNTIDY CONDITION BESIDE THAT
6614-67846-0024 SYLVIA WAS NOT SURE IF SHE COULD FIND HER WAY HOME UNLESS SHE CLIMBED BACK INTO THE GARDEN SHE LOOKED ALONG THE SHORE AT THE LANDING PLACE NOT FAR DISTANT WHERE SEVERAL BOATS WERE BOBBING UP AND DOWN IN THE WASH OF THE INCOMING TIDE
6614-67846-0025 SHE COULD SEE BOATS COMING AND GOING BETWEEN THE FORTS AND THE CITY SHE COULD SEE GRIM FORT SUMTER WITH ITS GUNS THAT SEEMED TO LOOK STRAIGHT AT HER SHE WATCHED A SCHOONER COMING ACROSS THE BAY AND REALIZED THAT IT WAS COMING TO THAT VERY WHARF
6614-67846-0026 A NUMBER OF MEN LANDED AND SEVERAL CARTS CAME DOWN AND BOXES WERE UNLOADED AND NEGROES CARRIED THEM TO THE SCHOONER SYLVIA GOT UP AND WALKED ALONG THE SHORE UNTIL SHE WAS NEAR THE WHARF AND STOOD WATCHING THE NEGROES AS THEY LIFTED THE HEAVY BOXES
6614-67846-0027 SHE WISHED SHE COULD ASK ONE OF THEM TO TELL HER THE WAY HOME THEN SHE NOTICED A TALL FIGURE IN UNIFORM COMING UP THE WHARF IT'S CAPTAIN CARLETON SHE EXCLAIMED JOYFULLY QUITE FORGETTING FOR THE MOMENT HER TORN DRESS AND SCRATCHED HANDS AS SHE RAN TOWARD HIM
6614-67846-0028 IS IT SYLVIA FULTON EXCLAIMED THE SURPRISED CAPTAIN LOOKING DOWN AT THE UNTIDY LITTLE FIGURE WHY WHAT HAS HAPPENED OH DEAR SOBBED SYLVIA I GUESS I'M LOST
6614-67846-0029 WELL WELL IT'S LUCKY YOU CAME DOWN TO THIS WHARF
6614-67846-0030 AND THE GOOD NATURED CAPTAIN RESTED A KINDLY HAND ON THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHOULDER AND WALKED DOWN THE WHARF SYLVIA HEARD THE MEN TALKING OF THE CHARLESTON ARSENAL AND OF THE BOXES OF ARMS WHICH WERE TO BE TAKEN ON THE SCHOONER TO FORT SUMTER
6614-67846-0031 THE CAPTAIN BATHED THE LITTLE HURT HANDS AND FLUSHED FACE TALKING PLEASANTLY TO THE LITTLE GIRL ABOUT THE SCHOONER AND ASKING HER IF SHE DID NOT THINK IT A MUCH FINER CRAFT THAN HER FATHER'S SMALL BOAT SO IN A LITTLE WHILE SHE WAS COMFORTED AND QUITE AT HOME
6614-67846-0032 NOW SIT HERE BY THE CABIN WINDOW AND I WILL COME BACK AND TAKE YOU HOME AS SOON AS I SETTLE THIS TROUBLE ABOUT MY SUPPLIES AND THE CAPTAIN HURRIED BACK TO THE WHARF SYLVIA SAT QUITE STILL AND LOOKED OUT OF THE ROUND PORT HOLE
6614-67846-0033 SHE FELT VERY TIRED AND LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST THE CUSHIONED WALL SHE COULD HEAR THE MONOTONOUS CHANT OF THE NEGROES AND FEEL THE SWAYING MOTION OF THE VESSEL AND SOON WAS FAST ASLEEP
6614-67846-0034 SHE DID NOT KNOW WHEN THE SCHOONER WAS TOWED OUT INTO THE CHANNEL NOR WHEN THE SAILS WERE HOISTED AND THEY WENT SAILING DOWN THE BAY FOR CAPTAIN CARLETON HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN HIS LITTLE GUEST
6614-67846-0035 WHEN HE HURRIED BACK TO THE WHARF HE DISCOVERED A LITTLE GROUP OF CHARLESTON CITIZENS ONE OF WHOM WAS ELINOR MAYHEW'S FATHER DISPUTING THE RIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES OFFICERS TO TAKE GUNS FROM THE CHARLESTON ARSENAL TO FORT SUMTER AND WHEN THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
6614-67846-0036 NOT UNTIL THEY WERE READY TO LAND AT THE FORT DID HE REMEMBER HIS LITTLE FRIEND HE WENT DOWN TO THE CABIN AND FOUND SYLVIA FAST ASLEEP POOR LITTLE YANKEE
6614-67846-0037 I WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HER IF SOUTH CAROLINA REALLY LEAVES THE UNION HE THOUGHT AND THEN HIS FACE GREW TROUBLED AS HE REMEMBERED THAT MISTER AND MISSUS FULTON MUST BE IN GREAT TROUBLE AND ANXIETY OVER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THEIR LITTLE DAUGHTER
6614-67846-0038 BUT FIRST OF ALL HE MUST SEE THE SCHOONER'S CARGO SAFELY UNLOADED AT FORT SUMTER AND SEND HIS MEN BACK TO FORT MOULTRIE
