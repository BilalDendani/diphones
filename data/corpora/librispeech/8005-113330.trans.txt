8005-113330-0000 TWO PERSONS HOWEVER HAD A SUSPICION OF THE TRUTH ONE OF THESE WAS THE PORTER OF THE BANK WHOSE SUSPICION WAS STRONG THE OTHER WAS LOUISA WHO THOUGH HER LOVE DENIED IT ROOM
8005-113330-0001 HID IN HER SECRET HEART A FEAR THAT HER BROTHER HAD HAD A SHARE IN THE CRIME IN THE NIGHT SHE WENT TO TOM'S BEDSIDE
8005-113330-0002 BUT HE ANSWERED SULLENLY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT MISSUS SPARSIT'S FINE BRED NERVES SO SHE INSISTED WERE SO SHAKEN BY THE ROBBERY THAT SHE CAME TO BOUNDERBY'S HOUSE TO REMAIN TILL SHE RECOVERED
8005-113330-0003 THE FEEBLE PINK EYED BUNDLE OF SHAWLS THAT WAS MISSUS GRADGRIND HAPPENING TO DIE AT THIS TIME AND LOUISA BEING ABSENT AT HER MOTHER'S FUNERAL MISSUS SPARSIT SAW HER OPPORTUNITY SHE HAD NEVER FORGIVEN LOUISA FOR MARRYING BOUNDERBY
8005-113330-0004 THAT THE VULGAR BULLY BEGAN TO THINK HIS COLD PROUD WIFE MUCH TOO REGARDLESS OF HIM AND OF HIS IMPORTANCE WHAT PLEASED THE HAWK FACED OLD BUSYBODY MOST WAS THE GAME THE SUAVE HARTHOUSE WAS PLAYING
8005-113330-0005 IF LOUISA WOULD ONLY DISGRACE HERSELF BY RUNNING AWAY WITH HARTHOUSE THOUGHT MISSUS SPARSIT BOUNDERBY MIGHT BE FREE AGAIN AND SHE MIGHT MARRY HIM SO SHE WATCHED NARROWLY THE GROWING INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM HOPING FOR LOUISA'S RUIN
8005-113330-0006 THERE CAME A DAY WHEN BOUNDERBY WAS SUMMONED ON BUSINESS TO LONDON AND LOUISA STAYED MEANWHILE AT THE BOUNDERBY COUNTRY HOUSE WHICH LAY SOME DISTANCE FROM COKETOWN MISSUS SPARSIT GUESSED THAT HARTHOUSE WOULD USE THIS CHANCE TO SEE LOUISA ALONE
8005-113330-0007 REACHING THERE AT NIGHTFALL SHE WENT AFOOT FROM THE STATION TO THE GROUNDS OPENED THE GATE SOFTLY AND CREPT CLOSE TO THE HOUSE HERE AND THERE IN THE DUSK THROUGH GARDEN AND WOOD SHE STOLE AND AT LENGTH SHE FOUND WHAT SHE SOUGHT
8005-113330-0008 THERE UNDER THE TREES STOOD HARTHOUSE HIS HORSE TIED NEAR BY
8005-113330-0009 MISSUS SPARSIT STOOD BEHIND A TREE LIKE ROBINSON CRUSOE
8005-113330-0010 SHE COULD NOT HEAR ALL BUT CAUGHT ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE WAS TELLING HER HE LOVED HER AND BEGGING HER TO LEAVE HER HUSBAND HER HOME AND FRIENDS AND TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM IN HER DELIGHT AND IN THE NOISE OF RAIN UPON THE FOLIAGE
8005-113330-0011 FOR A THUNDER STORM WAS ROLLING UP MISSUS SPARSIT DID NOT CATCH LOUISA'S ANSWER WHERE AND WHEN HARTHOUSE ASKED HER TO JOIN HIM SHE COULD NOT HEAR BUT AS HE MOUNTED AND RODE AWAY SHE THOUGHT HE SAID TO NIGHT
8005-113330-0012 SHE WAITED IN THE RAIN REJOICING TILL HER PATIENCE WAS AT LENGTH REWARDED BY SEEING LOUISA CLOAKED AND VEILED AS IF FOR A JOURNEY COME FROM THE HOUSE AND GO TOWARD THE RAILROAD STATION
8005-113330-0013 WET TO THE SKIN HER FEET SQUASHING IN HER SHOES HER CLOTHES SPOILED AND HER BONNET LOOKING LIKE AN OVER RIPE FIG WITH A TERRIBLE COLD THAT MADE HER VOICE ONLY A WHISPER AND SNEEZING HERSELF ALMOST TO PIECES
8005-113330-0014 MISSUS SPARSIT FOUND BOUNDERBY AT HIS CITY HOTEL EXPLODED WITH THE COMBUSTIBLE INFORMATION SHE CARRIED AND FAINTED QUITE AWAY ON HIS COAT COLLAR FURIOUS AT THE NEWS SHE BROUGHT BOUNDERBY HUSTLED HER INTO A FAST TRAIN AND TOGETHER
8005-113330-0015 OF HIS DAUGHTER'S DOINGS BUT WHERE MEANWHILE WAS LOUISA NOT RUN AWAY WITH HARTHOUSE AS MISSUS SPARSIT SO FONDLY IMAGINED BUT SAFE IN HER OWN FATHER'S HOUSE IN COKETOWN SHE HAD SUFFERED MUCH WITHOUT COMPLAINT
8005-113330-0016 ADDED TO ALL THE INSULTS SHE HAD SUFFERED AT HER HUSBAND'S HANDS AND HER FEARFUL SUSPICION OF TOM'S GUILT IT HAD PROVEN TOO MUCH FOR HER TO BEAR SHE HAD PRETENDED TO AGREE TO HARTHOUSE'S PLAN ONLY THAT SHE MIGHT THE MORE QUICKLY RID HERSELF OF HIS PRESENCE
8005-113330-0017 MISTER GRADGRIND ASTONISHED AT HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL AT STONE LODGE WAS SHOCKED NO LESS AT HER GHASTLY APPEARANCE THAN BY WHAT SHE SAID SHE TOLD HIM SHE CURSED THE HOUR WHEN SHE HAD BEEN BORN TO GROW UP A VICTIM TO HIS TEACHINGS
8005-113330-0018 THAT HER WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN EMPTY
8005-113330-0019 SHE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT HER MARRIAGE TO BOUNDERBY THAT SHE HAD MARRIED HIM SOLELY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TOM THE ONLY ONE SHE HAD EVER LOVED AND THAT NOW SHE COULD NO LONGER LIVE WITH HER HUSBAND OR BEAR THE LIFE SHE HAD MADE FOR HERSELF
8005-113330-0020 AND WHEN SHE HAD SAID THIS LOUISA THE DAUGHTER HIS SYSTEM HAD BROUGHT TO SUCH DESPAIR FELL AT HIS FEET AT HER PITIFUL TALE THE TENDER HEART THAT MISTER GRADGRIND HAD BURIED IN HIS LONG PAST YOUTH
8005-113330-0021 UNDER HIS MOUNTAIN OF FACTS STIRRED AGAIN AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE MOUNTAIN CRUMBLED AWAY AND HE SAW IN AN INSTANT AS BY A LIGHTNING FLASH THAT THE PLAN OF LIFE TO WHICH HE HAD SO RIGIDLY HELD WAS A COMPLETE AND HIDEOUS FAILURE
8005-113330-0022 HE HAD THOUGHT THERE WAS BUT ONE WISDOM THAT OF THE HEAD HE KNEW AT LAST THAT THERE WAS A DEEPER WISDOM OF THE HEART ALSO WHICH ALL THESE YEARS HE HAD DENIED WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF LOUISA FOUND HER FATHER SITTING BY HER BEDSIDE
8005-113330-0023 HIS FACE LOOKED WORN AND OLDER HE TOLD HER HE REALIZED AT LAST HIS LIFE MISTAKE AND BITTERLY REPROACHED HIMSELF SISSY TOO WAS THERE HER LOVE SHINING LIKE A BEAUTIFUL LIGHT ON THE OTHER'S DARKNESS SHE KNELT BESIDE THE BED
8005-113330-0024 AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME LOUISA BURST INTO SOBS NEXT DAY SISSY SOUGHT OUT HARTHOUSE WHO WAS WAITING FULL OF SULKY IMPATIENCE AT THE FAILURE OF LOUISA TO APPEAR AS HE HAD EXPECTED SISSY TOLD HIM PLAINLY WHAT HAD OCCURRED
8005-113330-0025 AND THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE LOUISA AGAIN HARTHOUSE REALIZING THAT HIS PLAN HAD FAILED SUDDENLY DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD A GREAT LIKING FOR CAMELS AND LEFT THE SAME HOUR FOR EGYPT NEVER TO RETURN TO COKETOWN
8005-113330-0026 IT WAS WHILE SISSY WAS ABSENT ON THIS ERRAND OF HER OWN THAT THE FURIOUS BOUNDERBY AND THE TRIUMPHANT MISSUS SPARSIT THE LATTER VOICELESS AND STILL SNEEZING APPEARED AT STONE LODGE
8005-113330-0027 MISTER GRADGRIND TOOK THE MILL OWNER GREATLY ABACK WITH THE STATEMENT THAT LOUISA HAD HAD NO INTENTION WHATEVER OF ELOPING AND WAS THEN IN THAT SAME HOUSE AND UNDER HIS CARE ANGRY AND BLUSTERING AT BEING MADE SUCH A FOOL OF
8005-113330-0028 BOUNDERBY TURNED ON MISSUS SPARSIT BUT IN HER DISAPPOINTMENT AT FINDING IT A MISTAKE SHE HAD DISSOLVED IN TEARS WHEN MISTER GRADGRIND TOLD HIM HE HAD CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR LOUISA TO REMAIN FOR SOME TIME THERE WITH HIM
8005-113330-0029 BOUNDERBY FLEW INTO A STILL GREATER RAGE AND STAMPED OFF SWEARING HIS WIFE SHOULD COME HOME BY NOON NEXT DAY OR NOT AT ALL TO BE SURE LOUISA DID NOT GO AND NEXT DAY BOUNDERBY SENT HER CLOTHES TO MISTER GRADGRIND
8005-113330-0030 ADVERTISED HIS COUNTRY HOUSE FOR SALE AND NEEDING SOMETHING TO TAKE HIS SPITE OUT UPON REDOUBLED HIS EFFORTS TO FIND THE ROBBER OF THE BANK
