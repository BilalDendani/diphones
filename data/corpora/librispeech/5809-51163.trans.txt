5809-51163-0000 YOU HAVE MADE NO END OF TROUBLE FOR US AND GAINED NOTHING FOR YOURSELF NOW I AM AFRAID WE SHAN'T GET BEYOND THE GERMAN LINES BEFORE DARK WE MAY EVEN HAVE TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN DANGEROUS TERRITORY AND ALL BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST AS MULISH AS
5809-51163-0001 AS A MULE HE FINISHED HELPLESSLY JOSEPH LAUGHED CAN'T YOU THINK OF ANYTHING MULISHER THAN A MULE HE SAID THERE ISN'T A THING
5809-51163-0002 I DON'T SEE WHY THEY WERE EVER BORN FATHER DE SMET BECAME SERIOUS AT ONCE SON HE SAID STERNLY
5809-51163-0003 THERE ARE SPIDERS AND RATS AND BALKY MULES AND GERMANS AND IT DOESN'T DO A BIT OF GOOD TO WASTE WORDS FUSSING BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE THE THING TO DO IS TO DEAL WITH THEM FATHER DE SMET WAS SO MUCH IN EARNEST
5809-51163-0004 HE SAID TO FATHER DE SMET IT'S A BALKY MULE REPLIED FATHER DE SMET MILDLY AND VERY OBSTINATE INDEED SNEERED THE SOLDIER THEN I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NAMED HIM ALBERT AFTER YOUR PIG HEADED KING
5809-51163-0005 I THINK TOO MUCH OF MY KING TO NAME MY MULE AFTER HIM OH HO SAID THE GERMAN THEN PERHAPS YOU HAVE NAMED HIM FOR THE KAISER NETTEKE HAD MARCHED STEADILY ALONG DURING THIS CONVERSATION AND THEY WERE NOW PAST THE SOLDIER
5809-51163-0006 AND AT LAST MOTHER DE SMET CALLED TO HER HUSBAND OVER THE BOATSIDE I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO STOP SOON AND FEED THE MULE OR SHE WILL BE TOO TIRED TO GET US ACROSS THE LINE AT ALL I BELIEVE WE SHOULD SAVE TIME BY STOPPING FOR SUPPER BESIDES
5809-51163-0007 I WANT TO SEND OVER THERE SHE POINTED TO A FARMHOUSE NOT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE RIVER AND GET SOME MILK AND EGGS VERY WELL SAID HER HUSBAND WE'LL STOP UNDER THAT BUNCH OF WILLOWS THE BUNCH OF WILLOWS BESIDE THE RIVER WHICH HE POINTED OUT
5809-51163-0008 PROVED TO BE A PLEASANT SHELTERED SPOT WITH GRASSY BANKS SLOPING DOWN TO THE WATER A TURN IN THE RIVER ENABLED THEM TO DRAW THE OLD WOMAN UP INTO THEIR SHADOWS AND BECAUSE THE TREES WERE GREEN AND THE BOAT WAS GREEN THE REFLECTIONS IN THE WATER WERE ALSO GREEN
5809-51163-0009 AND FOR THIS REASON THE BOAT SEEMED VERY WELL HIDDEN FROM VIEW I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHALL BE NOTICED HERE SAID FATHER DE SMET IT'S HOT ON THE BOAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO TAKE THE BABIES ASHORE WHILE WE EAT SAID MOTHER DE SMET RUNNING OUT THE GANGPLANK
5809-51163-0010 I BELIEVE WE'LL HAVE SUPPER ON THE GRASS YOU HURRY ALONG AND GET THE MILK AND EGGS AND I'LL COOK SOME ONIONS WHILE YOU ARE GONE JAN AND MARIE RAN OVER THE PLANK AT ONCE AND MOTHER DE SMET SOON FOLLOWED WITH THE BABIES THEN WHILE MARIE WATCHED THEM
5809-51163-0011 SHE AND JAN BROUGHT OUT THE ONIONS AND A PAN AND SOON THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF FRYING ONIONS JOSEPH AND JAN SLIPPED THE BRIDLE OVER NETTEKE'S COLLAR
5809-51163-0012 WHEN FATHER DE SMET RETURNED SUPPER WAS NEARLY READY HE SNIFFED APPRECIATIVELY AS HE APPEARED UNDER THE TREES SMELLS GOOD HE SAID
5809-51163-0013 YOU ARE RIGHT SAID A LOUD VOICE RIGHT BEHIND HIM FATHER DE SMET WAS SO STARTLED THAT HE DROPPED THE EGGS HE WHIRLED ABOUT AND THERE STOOD THE GERMAN SOLDIER WHO HAD TOLD NETTEKE TO HALT WITH HIM WERE SIX OTHER MEN
5809-51163-0014 BUT MOTHER DE SMET WAS NO LONGER TENDING THEM THE INSTANT SHE HEARD THE GRUFF VOICE SHE HAD DROPPED HER SPOON AND SEIZING A BABY UNDER EACH ARM HAD FLED UP THE GANGPLANK ON TO THE BOAT
5809-51163-0015 THERE IS NO HURRY AFTER SUPPER WILL DO BUT FIRST WE'LL DRINK A HEALTH TO THE KAISER AND SINCE YOU ARE HOST HERE YOU SHALL PROPOSE IT HE POINTED TO THE PAIL OF MILK WHICH FATHER DE SMET STILL HELD NOW HE SHOUTED
5809-51163-0016 HOCH DER KAISER FATHER DE SMET LOOKED THEM IN THE FACE AND SAID NOT A WORD MEANWHILE JAN AND JOSEPH TO MOTHER DE SMET'S GREAT ALARM HAD NOT FOLLOWED HER ON TO THE BOAT
5809-51163-0017 WAS PARTLY HIDDEN FROM THE GROUP BY A BUNCH OF YOUNG WILLOWS NEAR THE WATER'S EDGE AND WITH GREAT SPEED AND PRESENCE OF MIND HAD SLIPPED HER BRIDLE OVER HER HEAD AND GENTLY STARTED HER UP THE TOW PATH OH MURMURED JOSEPH SUPPOSE SHE SHOULD BALK
5809-51163-0018 BUT NETTEKE HAD DONE HER BALKING FOR THE DAY AND HAVING BEEN REFRESHED BY HER LUNCHEON OF GREEN GRASS SHE WAS READY TO MOVE ON THE RIVER HAD NOW QUITE A CURRENT WHICH HELPED THEM AND WHILE THE SOLDIERS WERE STILL HAVING THEIR JOKE WITH FATHER DE SMET
5809-51163-0019 THE BOAT MOVED QUIETLY OUT OF SIGHT AS SHE FELT IT MOVE MOTHER DE SMET LIFTED HER HEAD OVER THE BOAT'S RAIL BEHIND WHICH SHE AND THE CHILDREN WERE HIDING AND RAISED THE END OF THE GANGPLANK SO THAT IT WOULD MAKE NO NOISE BY SCRAPING ALONG THE GROUND
5809-51163-0020 SHE WAS BESIDE HERSELF WITH ANXIETY IF SHE SCREAMED OR SAID ANYTHING TO THE BOYS THE ATTENTION OF THE SOLDIERS WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE DIRECTED TOWARD THEM YET IF THEY SHOULD BY ANY MIRACLE SUCCEED IN GETTING AWAY
5809-51163-0021 THERE WAS HER HUSBAND LEFT ALONE TO FACE SEVEN ENEMIES SHE WRUNG HER HANDS MAYBE THEY WILL STOP TO EAT THE ONIONS SHE GROANED TO HERSELF SHE HELD TO THE GANGPLANK AND MURMURED PRAYERS TO ALL THE SAINTS SHE KNEW
5809-51163-0022 AND NETTEKE ASSISTED BY THE CURRENT MADE BETTER SPEED THAN SHE HAD AT ANY TIME DURING THE DAY MEANWHILE HIS CAPTORS WERE BUSY WITH FATHER DE SMET COME DRINK TO THE KAISER SHOUTED THE FIRST SOLDIER OR WE'LL FEED YOU TO THE FISHES
5809-51163-0023 WE WANT OUR SUPPER AND YOU DELAY US STILL FATHER DE SMET SAID NOTHING WE'LL GIVE YOU JUST UNTIL I COUNT TEN SAID THE SOLDIER POINTING HIS GUN AT HIM AND IF BY THAT TIME YOU HAVE NOT FOUND YOUR TONGUE BUT HE DID NOT FINISH THE SENTENCE
5809-51163-0024 ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS GAVE A HOWL AND FELL TO THE GROUND STILL NO ONE APPEARED AT WHOM THE GERMANS COULD DIRECT THEIR FIRE SNIPERS SHOUTED THE SOLDIERS INSTANTLY LOWERING THEIR GUNS
5809-51163-0025 BUT BEFORE THEY COULD EVEN FIRE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE UNSEEN ENEMY THERE WAS SUCH A PATTER OF BULLETS ABOUT THEM THAT THEY TURNED AND FLED FATHER DE SMET FLED TOO HE LEAPED OVER THE FRYING PAN AND TORE DOWN THE RIVER BANK AFTER THE BOAT
5809-51163-0026 AS HE OVERTOOK IT MOTHER DE SMET RAN OUT THE GANG PLANK BOYS SHOUTED FATHER DE SMET GET ABOARD GET ABOARD JOSEPH AND JAN INSTANTLY STOPPED THE MULE AND DROPPING THE REINS RACED UP THE GANGPLANK
5809-51163-0027 ALMOST BEFORE THE END OF IT RESTED SAFELY ON THE GROUND FATHER DE SMET SNATCHED UP THE REINS ON WENT THE BOAT AT NETTEKE'S BEST SPEED WHICH SEEMED NO BETTER THAN A SNAIL'S PACE TO THE FLEEING FAMILY
5809-51163-0028 SOUNDS OF THE SKIRMISH CONTINUED TO REACH THEIR EARS EVEN WHEN THEY HAD GONE SOME DISTANCE DOWN THE RIVER AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWILIGHT HAD DEEPENED INTO DUSK AND THEY WERE HIDDEN IN ITS SHADOWS THAT THEY DARED HOPE THE DANGER WAS PASSED
5809-51163-0029 IT WAS AFTER TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN THE OLD WOMAN AT LAST APPROACHED THE TWINKLING LIGHTS OF ANTWERP AND THEY KNEW THAT FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST THEY WERE SAFE THEY WORE NOW BEYOND THE GERMAN LINES IN COUNTRY STILL HELD BY THE BELGIANS
5809-51163-0030 HERE IN A SUBURB OF THE CITY FATHER DE SMET DECIDED TO DOCK FOR THE NIGHT A DISTANT CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN AS THE HUNGRY BUT THANKFUL FAMILY GATHERED UPON THE DECK OF THE OLD WOMAN TO EAT A MEAGER SUPPER OF BREAD AND CHEESE
5809-51163-0031 THEY MEANT TO AMUSE THEMSELVES BY PROLONGING MY MISERY AND THEY LINGERED JUST A BIT TOO LONG
5809-51163-0032 YOU WERE BRAVE BOYS IF YOU HAD NOT STARTED THE BOAT WHEN YOU DID IT IS QUITE LIKELY THEY MIGHT HAVE GOT ME AFTER ALL AND THE POTATOES TOO I AM PROUD OF YOU BUT FATHER CRIED JOSEPH WHO COULD HAVE FIRED THOSE SHOTS
5809-51163-0033 AS I FIGURE IT OUT SAID FATHER DE SMET WE MUST HAVE STOPPED VERY NEAR THE TRENCHES AND OUR OWN MEN MUST HAVE SEEN THE GERMANS ATTACK US MY GERMAN FRIEND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN FOLLOWING US UP MEANING TO GET EVERYTHING WE HAD AND ME TOO
5809-51163-0034 INSTEAD HE GOT A SALUTE FROM THE BELGIANS HE CROSSED HIMSELF REVERENTLY THANK GOD FOR OUR SOLDIERS HE SAID AND MOTHER DE SMET WEEPING SOFTLY MURMURED A DEVOUT AMEN
5809-51163-0035 LITTLE DID JAN AND MARIE DREAM AS THEY LISTENED THAT THIS BLESSING RESTED UPON THEIR OWN FATHER AND THAT HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE BELGIAN SOLDIERS WHO FIRING FROM THE TRENCHES HAD DELIVERED THEM FROM THE HANDS OF THEIR ENEMIES
