5913-40745-0000 NOT MANY YEARS AGO THERE ISSUED FROM A TOWN IN ESTRAMADURA A HIDALGO NOBLY BORN WHO LIKE ANOTHER PRODIGAL SON WENT ABOUT VARIOUS PARTS OF SPAIN ITALY AND FLANDERS
5913-40745-0001 SQUANDERING HIS YEARS AND HIS WEALTH AT LAST AFTER LONG PEREGRINATIONS HIS PARENTS BEING DEAD AND HIS FORTUNE SPENT
5913-40745-0002 TO GET RID OF THE LITTLE HE HAD LEFT FINDING HIMSELF THEN SO BARE OF MONEY AND NOT BETTER PROVIDED WITH FRIENDS HE ADOPTED THE REMEDY TO WHICH MANY A SPENDTHRIFT IN THAT CITY HAS RECOURSE THAT IS TO BETAKE THEMSELVES TO THE INDIES
5913-40745-0003 THE REFUGE OF THE DESPAIRING SONS OF SPAIN THE CHURCH OF THE HOMELESS THE ASYLUM OF HOMICIDES THE HAVEN OF GAMBLERS AND CHEATS THE GENERAL RECEPTACLE FOR LOOSE WOMEN THE COMMON CENTRE OF ATTRACTION FOR MANY BUT
5913-40745-0004 EFFECTUAL RESOURCE OF VERY FEW A FLEET BEING ABOUT TO SAIL FOR TIERRAFIRMA HE AGREED WITH THE ADMIRAL FOR A PASSAGE GOT READY HIS SEA STORES AND HIS SHROUD OF SPANISH GRASS CLOTH AND EMBARKING AT CADIZ
5913-40745-0005 GAVE HIS BENEDICTION TO SPAIN INTENDING NEVER TO SEE IT AGAIN THE FLEET SLIPPED FROM ITS MOORINGS AND AMIDST THE GENERAL GLEE OF ITS LIVING FREIGHT THE SAILS WERE SPREAD TO THE SOFT AND PROSPEROUS GALE WHICH SOON WAFTED THEM OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
5913-40745-0006 THE OCEAN OUR PASSENGER NOW BECAME VERY THOUGHTFUL REVOLVING IN HIS MEMORY THE MANY AND VARIOUS DANGERS HE HAD PASSED IN THE YEARS OF HIS PEREGRINATIONS AND THE THRIFTLESS CONDUCT HE HAD PURSUED ALL HIS LIFE LONG
5913-40745-0007 THE RESULT OF THE ACCOUNT TO WHICH HE THUS CALLED HIMSELF WAS A FIRM RESOLUTION TO CHANGE HIS WAY OF LIFE TO KEEP A MUCH BETTER HOLD OF WHATEVER WEALTH GOD MIGHT YET BE PLEASED TO BESTOW UPON HIM
5913-40745-0008 AND CONCERN HIMSELF ONLY WITH THE AFFAIRS OF HIS VOYAGE IT WAS SO PROSPEROUS THAT THEY ARRIVED WITHOUT CHECK OR ACCIDENT AT THE PORT OF CARTAGENA
5913-40745-0009 TO RETURN TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY REJECTING THEREFORE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFIT WHICH PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HIM HE QUITTED PERU WHERE HE HAD AMASSED HIS WEALTH TURNED ALL HIS MONEY INTO INGOTS AND PUTTING IT ON BOARD A REGISTERED SHIP
5913-40745-0010 TO AVOID ACCIDENTS RETURNED TO SPAIN LANDED AT SAN LUCAR AND ARRIVED AT SEVILLE LOADED ALIKE WITH YEARS AND RICHES HAVING PLACED HIS PROPERTY IN SAFETY HE WENT IN SEARCH OF HIS FRIENDS
5913-40745-0011 HE HAD NO REST FROM THE THOUGHTS THAT DISTRACTED HIM IN THE MIDST OF THE WIDE OCEAN HE WAS NOW NO LESS ASSAILED BY CARE BUT FROM A DIFFERENT CAUSE FORMERLY HIS POVERTY WOULD NOT LET HIM SLEEP AND NOW HIS WEALTH DISTURBED HIS REST
5913-40745-0012 FOR RICHES ARE AS HEAVY A BURDEN TO ONE WHO IS NOT USED TO THEM OR KNOWS NOT HOW TO EMPLOY THEM AS INDIGENCE TO ONE WHO IS CONTINUALLY UNDER ITS PRESSURE MONEY AND THE WANT OF IT ALIKE BRING CARE
5913-40745-0013 BUT IN THE ONE CASE THE ACQUISITION OF A MODERATE QUANTITY AFFORDS A REMEDY THE OTHER CASE GROWS WORSE BY FURTHER ACQUISITION CARRIZALES CONTEMPLATED HIS INGOTS WITH ANXIETY NOT AS A MISER
5913-40745-0014 ALL INCLINATION FOR RESUMING THE ANXIOUS LIFE OF TRAFFIC HAD DIED OUT IN HIM AND AT HIS TIME OF LIFE HIS ACTUAL WEALTH WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THE REST OF HIS DAYS HE WOULD FAIN HAVE SPENT THEM IN HIS NATIVE PLACE PUT OUT HIS MONEY THERE TO INTEREST
5913-40745-0015 AND PASSED HIS OLD AGE IN PEACE AND QUIET GIVING WHAT HE COULD TO GOD SINCE HE HAD GIVEN MORE THAN HE OUGHT TO THE WORLD HE CONSIDERED HOWEVER THAT THE PENURY OF HIS NATIVE PLACE WAS GREAT THE INHABITANTS VERY NEEDY
5913-40745-0016 AND THAT TO GO AND LIVE THERE WOULD BE TO OFFER HIMSELF AS A MARK FOR ALL THE IMPORTUNITIES WITH WHICH THE POOR USUALLY HARASS A RICH NEIGHBOUR ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS ONLY ONE IN THE PLACE TO WHOM THEY CAN HAVE RECOURSE IN THEIR DISTRESS
5913-40745-0017 HE WANTED SOME ONE TO WHOM HE MIGHT LEAVE HIS PROPERTY AFTER HIS DEATH AND WITH THAT VIEW
5913-40745-0018 HE CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS NOT YET TOO OLD TO BEAR THE BURTHEN OF MATRIMONY BUT IMMEDIATELY ON CONCEIVING THIS NOTION HE WAS SEIZED WITH SUCH A TERRIBLE FEAR AS SCATTERED IT LIKE A MIST BEFORE THE WIND
5913-40745-0019 HE WAS NATURALLY THE MOST JEALOUS MAN IN THE WORLD EVEN WITHOUT BEING MARRIED AND THE MERE THOUGHT OF TAKING A WIFE CALLED UP SUCH HORRIBLE SPECTRES BEFORE HIS IMAGINATION THAT HE RESOLVED BY ALL MEANS TO REMAIN A BACHELOR
5913-40745-0020 THAT POINT WAS SETTLED BUT IT WAS NOT YET SETTLED WHAT HE SHOULD DO WITH THE REST OF HIS LIFE WHEN IT CHANCED THAT
5913-40745-0021 HE LOOKED UP AND SAW AT A WINDOW A YOUNG GIRL APPARENTLY ABOUT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN WITH A FACE SO VERY HANDSOME AND SO VERY PLEASING IN ITS EXPRESSION THAT POOR OLD CARRIZALES WAS VANQUISHED AT ONCE
5913-40745-0022 AND SURRENDERED WITHOUT AN EFFORT TO THE CHARMS OF THE BEAUTIFUL LEONORA FOR THAT WAS THE GIRL'S NAME WITHOUT MORE ADO HE BEGAN TO STRING TOGETHER A LONG TRAIN OF ARGUMENTS TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT THIS GIRL IS VERY HANDSOME
5913-40745-0023 AND TO JUDGE FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSE HER PARENTS CANNOT BE RICH SHE IS ALMOST A CHILD TOO ASSUREDLY A WIFE OF HER AGE COULD NOT GIVE A HUSBAND ANY UNEASINESS LET ME SEE
5913-40745-0024 SAY THAT I MARRY HER I WILL KEEP HER CLOSE AT HOME I WILL TRAIN HER UP TO MY OWN HAND AND SO FASHION HER TO MY WISHES THAT SHE WILL NEVER HAVE A THOUGHT BEYOND THEM I AM NOT SO OLD
5913-40745-0025 BUT THAT I MAY YET HOPE TO HAVE CHILDREN TO INHERIT MY WEALTH WHETHER SHE BRINGS ME ANY DOWER OR NOT IS A MATTER OF NO CONSIDERATION SINCE HEAVEN HAS GIVEN ME ENOUGH FOR BOTH AND RICH PEOPLE SHOULD NOT LOOK FOR MONEY WITH A WIFE
5913-40745-0026 BUT FOR ENJOYMENT FOR THAT PROLONGS LIFE WHEREAS JARRING DISCONTENT BETWEEN MARRIED PEOPLE MAKES IT WEAR OUT FASTER THAN IT WOULD DO OTHERWISE SO BE IT THEN THE DIE IS CAST
5913-40745-0027 AND THIS IS THE WIFE WHOM HEAVEN DESTINES ME TO HAVE HAVING THUS SOLILOQUISED NOT ONCE BUT A HUNDRED TIMES ON THAT DAY AND THE TWO OR THREE FOLLOWING CARRIZALES HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH LEONORA'S PARENTS
5913-40745-0028 AND FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH POOR THEY WERE PERSONS OF GOOD BIRTH HE MADE KNOWN HIS INTENTION TO THEM ACQUAINTED THEM WITH HIS CONDITION AND FORTUNE AND BEGGED THEM VERY EARNESTLY TO BESTOW THEIR DAUGHTER UPON HIM IN MARRIAGE
5913-40745-0029 THEY REQUIRED TIME TO CONSIDER HIS PROPOSAL AND TO GIVE HIM ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO SATISFY HIMSELF THAT THEIR BIRTH AND QUALITY WAS SUCH AS THEY HAD STATED THE PARTIES TOOK LEAVE OF EACH OTHER MADE THE NECESSARY INQUIRIES
5913-40745-0030 FOUND THEM SATISFACTORY ON BOTH SIDES AND FINALLY LEONORA WAS BETROTHED TO CARRIZALES WHO SETTLED UPON HER TWENTY THOUSAND DUCATS SO HOTLY ENAMOURED WAS THE JEALOUS OLD BRIDEGROOM BUT NO SOONER HAD HE PRONOUNCED THE CONJUGAL YES
5913-40745-0031 IN RESOLVING THAT NO TAILOR SHOULD TAKE MEASURE OF HIS BETROTHED FOR ANY OF THE MANY WEDDING GARMENTS HE INTENDED TO PRESENT HER ACCORDINGLY HE WENT ABOUT LOOKING FOR SOME OTHER WOMAN WHO MIGHT BE NEARLY OF THE SAME HEIGHT AND FIGURE AS LEONORA
5913-40745-0032 HE FOUND A POOR WOMAN WHO SEEMED SUITABLE FOR HIS PURPOSE AND HAVING HAD A GOWN MADE TO HER MEASURE HE TRIED IT ON HIS BETROTHED FOUND THAT IT FITTED WELL AND GAVE ORDERS THAT IT SHOULD SERVE AS A PATTERN FOR ALL THE OTHER DRESSES
5913-40745-0033 WHICH WERE SO MANY AND SO RICH THAT THE BRIDE'S PARENTS THOUGHT THEMSELVES FORTUNATE BEYOND MEASURE IN HAVING OBTAINED FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR DAUGHTER
5913-40745-0034 SO NOBLY MUNIFICENT AS FOR LEONORA SHE WAS AT HER WIT'S END WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE SIGHT OF SUCH GORGEOUS FINERY FOR THE BEST SHE HAD EVER WORN IN HER LIFE
5913-40745-0035 THAT HE WOULD NOT CONSUMMATE HIS MARRIAGE UNTIL HE HAD PROVIDED A HOUSE AFTER HIS OWN FANCY WHICH HE ARRANGED IN THIS SINGULAR MANNER
5913-40745-0036 IN ONE OF THE BEST WARDS OF THE CITY WITH A FOUNTAIN AND POND AND A GARDEN WELL STOCKED WITH ORANGE TREES HE PUT SCREENS BEFORE ALL THE WINDOWS THAT LOOKED TOWARDS THE STREET LEAVING THEM NO OTHER PROSPECT THAN THE SKY
5913-40745-0037 AND DID MUCH THE SAME WITH ALL THE OTHERS IN THE HOUSE IN THE GATEWAY NEXT THE STREET HE ERECTED A STABLE FOR A MULE AND OVER IT A STRAW LOFT AND A ROOM FOR AN OLD BLACK EUNUCH
5913-40745-0038 HE RAISED THE PARAPETS ROUND THE FLAT ROOF OF THE HOUSE SO HIGH THAT NOTHING COULD BE SEEN ABOVE THEM BUT THE SKY AND THAT ONLY BY TURNING ONE'S FACE UPWARDS IN THE INNER DOOR OPENING FROM THE GATEWAY UPON THE QUADRANGLE
5913-40745-0039 HE FIXED A TURNING BOX LIKE THAT OF A CONVENT BY MEANS OF WHICH ARTICLES WERE TO BE RECEIVED FROM WITHOUT HE FURNISHED THE HOUSE IN A SUMPTUOUS STYLE SUCH AS WOULD HAVE BECOME THE MANSION OF A GREAT LORD AND HE BOUGHT FOUR WHITE SLAVE GIRLS
5913-40745-0040 WHOM HE BRANDED IN THE FACE AND TWO NEGRESSES FOR THE DAILY SUPPLIES OF HIS ESTABLISHMENT HE ENGAGED A PURVEYOR WHO WAS TO MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY PURCHASES
5913-40745-0041 PART HE PLACED IN THE BANK AND THE REST HE KEPT BY HIM TO MEET ANY EMERGENCIES THAT MIGHT ARISE
5913-40745-0042 AND HE LAID UP A WHOLE YEAR'S STORE OF ALL SUCH THINGS AS IT IS USUAL TO PURCHASE IN BULK AT THEIR RESPECTIVE SEASONS AND EVERYTHING BEING NOW READY TO HIS MIND HE WENT TO HIS FATHER IN LAW'S HOUSE AND CLAIMED HIS BRIDE
5913-40745-0043 WHOM HER PARENTS DELIVERED UP TO HIM WITH NO FEW TEARS FOR IT SEEMED TO THEM AS IF THEY WERE GIVING HER UP FOR BURIAL LEONORA KNEW NOT POOR YOUNG CREATURE WHAT WAS BEFORE HER
5913-40745-0044 BUT SHE SHED TEARS BECAUSE SHE SAW HER PARENTS WEEP AND TAKING LEAVE OF THEM WITH THEIR BLESSING SHE WENT TO HER NEW HOME HER HUSBAND LEADING HER BY THE HAND AND HER SLAVES AND SERVANTS ATTENDING HER ON THEIR ARRIVAL
5913-40745-0045 CARRIZALES HARANGUED ALL HIS DOMESTICS ENJOINING THEM TO KEEP CAREFUL WATCH OVER LEONORA AND BY NO MEANS ON ANY PRETENCE WHATSOEVER TO ALLOW ANYBODY TO ENTER WITHIN THE SECOND GATE NOT EVEN THE BLACK EUNUCH
5913-40745-0046 BUT THE PERSON WHOM ABOVE ALL OTHERS HE CHARGED WITH THE SAFE KEEPING AND DUE ENTERTAINMENT OF HIS WIFE WAS A DUENA OF MUCH PRUDENCE AND GRAVITY WHOM HE HAD TAKEN TO BE LEONORA'S MONITRESS AND SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WHOLE HOUSE
5913-40745-0047 AND TO COMMAND THE SLAVES AND TWO OTHER MAIDENS OF LEONORA'S AGE WHOM HE HAD ALSO ADDED TO HIS FAMILY THAT HIS WIFE MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT COMPANIONS OF HER OWN YEARS HE PROMISED THEM ALL THAT HE WOULD TREAT THEM SO WELL
5913-40745-0048 AND TAKE SUCH CARE FOR THEIR COMFORT AND GRATIFICATION THAT THEY SHOULD NOT FEEL THEIR CONFINEMENT AND THAT ON HOLIDAYS THEY SHOULD EVERY ONE OF THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION BE ALLOWED TO GO TO MASS BUT SO EARLY IN THE MORNING THAT DAYLIGHT ITSELF
5913-40745-0049 SHOULD SCARCELY HAVE A CHANCE OF SEEING THEM THE SERVANT MAIDS AND THE SLAVES PROMISED TO OBEY ALL HIS ORDERS CHEERFULLY AND WITH PROMPT ALACRITY AND THE BRIDE WITH A TIMID SHRINKING OF HER SHOULDERS BOWED HER HEAD
5913-40745-0050 AND SAID THAT SHE HAD NO OTHER WILL THAN THAT OF HER LORD AND SPOUSE TO WHOM SHE ALWAYS OWED OBEDIENCE HAVING THUS LAID DOWN THE LAW FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS HOUSEHOLD THE WORTHY ESTRAMADURAN BEGAN TO ENJOY AS WELL AS HE COULD
5913-40745-0051 THE FRUITS OF MATRIMONY WHICH TO LEONORA'S INEXPERIENCED TASTE WERE NEITHER SWEET FLAVOURED NOR INSIPID HER DAYS WERE SPENT WITH HER DUENA HER DAMSELS AND HER SLAVES WHO TO MAKE THE TIME PASS MORE AGREEABLY
5913-40745-0052 FOR BY THAT MEANS HE EXPECTED TO KEEP THEM OCCUPIED AND AMUSED SO THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE NO TIME TO THINK OF THEIR CONFINEMENT AND SECLUSION LEONORA LIVED ON A FOOTING OF EQUALITY WITH HER DOMESTICS AMUSED HERSELF AS THEY DID
5913-40745-0053 AND THAT IT WAS NOT WITHIN THE COMPASS OF HUMAN ART OR MALICE TO TROUBLE HIS REPOSE ACCORDINGLY HIS WHOLE CARE WAS DEVOTED TO ANTICIPATING HIS WIFE'S WISHES BY ALL SORTS OF PRESENTS AND ENCOURAGING HER TO ASK FOR WHATEVER CAME INTO HER HEAD
5913-40745-0054 FOR IN EVERYTHING IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO GRATIFY HER ON THE DAYS SHE WENT TO MASS WHICH AS WE HAVE SAID WAS BEFORE DAYLIGHT
5913-40745-0055 WHO MADE THEM SUCH LIBERAL GIFTS AS MITIGATED THE KEENNESS OF THEIR COMPASSION FOR THE SECLUDED LIFE LED BY THEIR DAUGHTER CARRIZALES USED TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND WATCH FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE PURVEYOR WHO WAS ALWAYS MADE AWARE OF WHAT WAS WANTED FOR THE DAY
5913-40745-0056 BY MEANS OF A NOTE PLACED OVER NIGHT IN THE TURNING BOX AFTER THE PURVEYOR HAD COME AND GONE CARRIZALES USED TO GO ABROAD GENERALLY ON FOOT LOCKING BOTH ENTRANCE DOORS BEHIND HIM THAT NEXT THE STREET
5913-40745-0057 AND THAT WHICH OPENED ON THE QUADRANGLE AND LEAVING THE NEGRO SHUT UP BETWEEN THEM HAVING DESPATCHED HIS BUSINESS WHICH WAS NOT MUCH HE SPEEDILY RETURNED SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS HOUSE
5913-40745-0058 AND OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN MAKING MUCH OF HIS WIFE AND HER HANDMAIDS WHO ALL LIKED HIM FOR HIS PLACID AND AGREEABLE HUMOUR AND ABOVE ALL FOR HIS GREAT LIBERALITY TOWARDS THEM IN THIS WAY THEY PASSED A YEAR OF NOVITIATE
5913-40745-0059 AND MADE PROFESSION OF THAT MANNER OF LIFE RESOLVED EVERY ONE OF THEM TO CONTINUE IN IT TO THE END OF THEIR DAYS
5913-40745-0060 SINCE HE WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANY MALE ANIMAL WITHIN HIS DWELLING NO TOM CAT EVER PERSECUTED ITS RATS NOR WAS THE BARKING OF A DOG EVER HEARD WITHIN ITS WALLS ALL CREATURES BELONGING TO IT WERE OF THE FEMININE GENDER
5913-40745-0061 HE TOOK THOUGHT BY DAY AND BY NIGHT HE DID NOT SLEEP HE WAS HIMSELF THE PATROL AND SENTINEL OF HIS HOUSE AND THE ARGUS OF WHAT HE HELD DEAR NEVER DID A MAN SET FOOT WITHIN THE QUADRANGLE
5913-40745-0062 HE TRANSACTED HIS BUSINESS WITH HIS FRIENDS IN THE STREET THE PICTURES THAT ADORNED HIS ROOMS WERE ALL FEMALE FIGURES FLOWERS OR LANDSCAPES
5913-40745-0063 THE VERY TALES WHICH THE MAID SERVANTS TOLD BY THE FIRESIDE IN THE LONG WINTER NIGHTS BEING TOLD IN HIS PRESENCE WERE PERFECTLY FREE FROM THE LEAST TINGE OF WANTONNESS HER AGED SPOUSE'S SILVER HAIRS
5913-40745-0064 SEEMED IN LEONORA'S EYES LOCKS OF PURE GOLD FOR THE FIRST LOVE KNOWN BY MAIDENS IMPRINTS ITSELF ON THEIR HEARTS LIKE A SEAL ON MELTED WAX HIS INORDINATE WATCHFULNESS
5913-40745-0065 SEEMED TO HER NO MORE THAN THE DUE CAUTION OF AN EXPERIENCED AND JUDICIOUS MAN SHE WAS FULLY PERSUADED THAT THE LIFE SHE LED WAS THE SAME AS THAT LED BY ALL MARRIED WOMEN HER THOUGHTS NEVER WANDERED BEYOND THE WALLS OF HER DWELLING
5913-40745-0066 NEVER WAS THERE SEEN A CONVENT MORE CLOSELY BARRED AND BOLTED NEVER WERE NUNS KEPT MORE RECLUSE OR GOLDEN APPLES BETTER GUARDED AND YET FOR ALL HIS PRECAUTIONS
5913-40745-0067 OR AT LEAST BELIEVING THAT HE HAD SO FALLEN
5913-40745-0068 AN IDLE PLEASURE SEEKING CLASS OF PEOPLE
5913-40745-0069 ALWAYS FINDING MEANS TO MAKE THEMSELVES WELCOME AT RICH MEN'S FEASTS OF THESE PEOPLE THEIR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AND THE LAWS THEY OBSERVE AMONG THEMSELVES I SHOULD HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT ABSTAIN FROM IT FOR GOOD REASONS ONE OF THESE GALLANTS A BACHELOR
5913-40745-0070 AS SUCH PERSONS ARE CALLED IN THEIR JARGON
5913-40745-0071 TOOK NOTICE OF THE HOUSE OF CARRIZALES AND SEEING IT ALWAYS SHUT CLOSE HE WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHO LIVED THERE HE SET ABOUT THIS INQUIRY WITH SUCH ARDOUR AND INGENUITY THAT HE FAILED NOT TO OBTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION HE DESIRED
5913-40745-0072 HE LEARNED THE CHARACTER AND HABITS OF THE OLD MAN THE BEAUTY OF LEONORA AND THE SINGULAR METHOD ADOPTED BY HER HUSBAND IN ORDER TO KEEP HER SAFE ALL THIS INFLAMED HIM WITH DESIRE TO SEE IF IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE BY FORCE OR STRATAGEM
5913-40745-0073 TO EFFECT THE REDUCTION OF SO WELL GUARDED A FORTRESS HE IMPARTED HIS THOUGHTS TO THREE OF HIS FRIENDS AND THEY ALL AGREED THAT HE SHOULD GO TO WORK
5913-40745-0074 AT FIRST THEY WERE AT A LOSS HOW TO SET ABOUT SO DIFFICULT AN EXPLOIT BUT AFTER MANY CONSULTATIONS THEY AGREED UPON THE FOLLOWING PLAN LOAYSA
5913-40745-0075 DISAPPEARED FROM AMONG HIS FRIENDS
5913-40745-0076 THEN DRAWING ON A PAIR OF LINEN DRAWERS AND A CLEAN SHIRT HE PUT OVER THEM A SUIT OF CLOTHES SO TORN AND PATCHED THAT THE POOREST BEGGAR IN THE CITY WOULD HAVE DISDAINED TO WEAR SUCH RAGS HE SHAVED OFF THE LITTLE BEARD HE HAD
5913-40745-0077 LOAYSA PRODUCED A GREASY GUITAR WANTING SOME OF ITS STRINGS AND AS HE WAS SOMETHING OF A MUSICIAN HE BEGAN TO PLAY A FEW LOVELY AIRS AND TO SING MOORISH BALLADS IN A FEIGNED VOICE
5913-40745-0078 WITH SO MUCH EXPRESSION THAT ALL WHO WERE PASSING THROUGH THE STREET STOPPED TO LISTEN THE BOYS ALL MADE A RING ROUND HIM WHEN HE SANG AND LUIS THE NEGRO
5913-40745-0079 LOAYSA FOUR OR FIVE TIMES REPEATED THIS SERENADE TO THE NEGRO FOR WHOSE SAKE ALONE HE PLAYED AND SANG THINKING THAT THE WAY TO SUCCEED IN HIS SAP AND SIEGE WAS TO BEGIN BY MAKING SURE OF OLD LUIS NOR WAS HIS EXPECTATION DISAPPOINTED
5913-40745-0080 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD TAKEN HIS PLACE AS USUAL BEFORE THE DOOR AND HAD BEGUN TO TIME HIS GUITAR PERCEIVING THAT THE NEGRO WAS ALREADY ON THE ALERT HE PUT HIS LIPS TO THE KEY HOLE AND WHISPERED
5913-40745-0081 I AM DYING WITH THIRST AND CAN'T SING NO SAID THE NEGRO FOR I HAVE NOT THE KEY OF THIS DOOR AND THERE IS NO HOLE THROUGH WHICH I CAN GIVE YOU DRINK WHO KEEPS THE KEY THEN MY MASTER
5913-40745-0082 WHO IS THE MOST JEALOUS MAN IN THE WORLD AND IF HE KNEW THAT I WAS NOW TALKING HERE WITH ANY ONE IT WERE PITY OF MY LIFE BUT WHO ARE YOU WHO ASK ME FOR WATER I AM A POOR CRIPPLE
5913-40745-0083 BESIDES WHICH I TEACH THE GUITAR TO SOME MORISCOES AND OTHER POOR PEOPLE AMONG MY PUPILS I HAVE THREE NEGROES SLAVES TO THREE ALDERMEN WHOM I HAVE TAUGHT SO WELL THAT THEY ARE FIT TO SING AND PLAY AT DANCE OR IN ANY TAVERN
5913-40745-0084 AND THEY HAVE PAID ME FOR IT VERY WELL INDEED A DEAL BETTER WOULD I PAY YOU TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING LESSONS BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR WHEN MY MASTER GOES OUT IN THE MORNING HE LOCKS THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND HE DOES THE SAME WHEN HE COMES IN
5913-40745-0085 LEAVING ME SHUT UP BETWEEN TWO DOORS
5913-40745-0086 AND FROM WHAT I CAN JUDGE FROM THE TONE OF YOUR VOICE YOU MUST SING VERY WELL I DON'T SING BADLY
5913-40745-0087 EXCEPT THE STAR OF VENUS OR IN THE GREEN MEADOW OR THE TUNE THAT IS NOW SO MUCH IN VOGUE CLINGING TO HER GRATED WINDOW WITH A TREMBLING HAND ALL THESE ARE MOONSHINE TO WHAT I COULD TEACH YOU
5913-40745-0088 WITH THOSE OF HIS LADY XARIFA AND ALL THOSE COMPRISING THE HISTORY OF THE GRAND SOFI TOMUNIBEYO
5913-40745-0089 AMONG WHOM THEY ARE MOST IN VOGUE AND ALL THESE I TEACH BY SUCH METHODS AND WITH SUCH FACILITY THAT ALMOST BEFORE YOU HAVE SWALLOWED THREE OR FOUR BUSHELS OF SALT YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF AN OUT AND OUT PERFORMER IN EVERY KIND OF GUITAR MUSIC
5913-40745-0090 WITH WHICH YOU MAY TAKE AN IMPRESSION OF THE WARDS FOR I HAVE TAKEN SUCH A LIKING TO YOU I WILL GET A LOCKSMITH A FRIEND OF MINE TO MAKE NEW KEYS AND THEN I CAN COME IN AT NIGHT AND TEACH YOU TO PLAY BETTER THAN PRESTER JOHN IN THE INDIES IT IS A THOUSAND PITIES
5913-40745-0091 THAT A VOICE LIKE YOURS SHOULD BE LOST FOR WANT OF THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE GUITAR
5913-40745-0092 THAT THE FINEST VOICE IN THE WORLD LOSES ITS PERFECTION WHEN IT IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY SOME INSTRUMENT BE IT GUITAR OR HARPSICHORD ORGAN OR HARP BUT THE INSTRUMENT THAT WILL SUIT YOUR VOICE BEST IS THE GUITAR BECAUSE IT IS THE HANDIEST
5913-40745-0093 AND THE LEAST COSTLY OF ALL ALL THAT IS VERY GOOD BUT THE THING CAN'T BE DONE FOR I NEVER GET HOLD OF THE KEYS NOR DOES MY MASTER EVER LET THEM OUT OF HIS KEEPING DAY AND NIGHT THEY SLEEP UNDER HIS PILLOW WELL THEN
5913-40745-0094 IF IT WERE POSSIBLE ANYHOW FOR SAKE OF BEING ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC WELL IF THAT'S THE CASE
5913-40745-0095 AND I WILL GIVE YOU THROUGH THAT OPENING A PAIR OF PINCERS AND A HAMMER WITH WHICH YOU MAY BY NIGHT DRAW OUT THE NAILS OF THE STAPLE AND WE CAN EASILY PUT THAT TO RIGHTS AGAIN SO THAT NO ONE WILL EVER SUSPECT THAT THE LOCK WAS OPENED
5913-40745-0096 ONCE SHUT UP WITH YOU IN YOUR LOFT OR WHEREVER YOU SLEEP
5913-40745-0097 THAT YOU WILL TURN OUT EVEN BETTER THAN I SAID TO MY OWN PERSONAL ADVANTAGE AND TO THE INCREASE OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF ANY CONCERN ABOUT WHAT WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT I WILL BRING ENOUGH TO LAST US BOTH FOR MORE THAN A WEEK
5913-40745-0098 AND I WILL MAKE AN OPENING CLOSE TO THE HINGE THROUGH WHICH YOU MAY PASS THEM IN AND I WILL STOP IT UP AGAIN WITH MUD
5913-40745-0099 AND EVEN SHOULD IT BE NECESSARY TO GIVE SOME LOUD KNOCKS
5913-40745-0100 WELL THEN WITH THE BLESSING OF GOD FRIEND LUIS IN TWO DAYS FROM THIS TIME YOU SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY FOR THE EXECUTION OF YOUR LAUDABLE PURPOSE MEANWHILE TAKE CARE NOT TO EAT SUCH THINGS AS ARE APT TO MAKE PHLEGM
5913-40745-0101 FOR THEY DO THE VOICE NO GOOD BUT A DEAL OF HARM NOTHING MAKES ME SO HOARSE SO MUCH AS WINE BUT I WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP FOR ALL THE VOICES ABOVE GROUND
5913-40745-0102 DRINK LUIS MY BOY DRINK AND MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO YOU FOR WINE DRUNK IN MEASURE NEVER DID ANY ONE HARM I ALWAYS DRINK IN MEASURE I HAVE A JUG HERE THAT HOLDS EXACTLY THREE PINTS AND A HALF THE GIRLS FILL THIS FOR ME UNKNOWN TO MY MASTER
5913-40745-0103 AND THE PURVEYOR BRINGS ME ON THE SLY
5913-40745-0104 THAT'S THE WAY TO LIVE MY BOY
5913-40745-0105 I'LL JUST SING YOU ONE SONG BUT WHEN I AM INSIDE YOU WILL SEE WONDERS HERE ENDED THIS LONG DIALOGUE AND LOAYSA SANG A SPRIGHTLY DITTY WITH SUCH GOOD EFFECT THAT THE NEGRO WAS IN ECSTACIES
5913-40745-0106 AND FELT AS IF THE TIME FOR OPENING THE DOOR WOULD NEVER ARRIVE HAVING FINISHED HIS SONG LOAYSA TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND SET OFF AT A ROUNDER PACE THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED OF A MAN ON CRUTCHES TO REPORT TO HIS FRIENDS WHAT A GOOD BEGINNING HE HAD MADE
5913-40745-0107 HE TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD CONCERTED WITH THE NEGRO AND THE FOLLOWING DAY THEY PROCURED TOOLS OF THE RIGHT SORT FIT TO BREAK ANY FASTENING AS IF IT WAS MADE OF STRAW
5913-40745-0108 WHICH HE PLASTERED UP SO WELL THAT NO ONE COULD PERCEIVE IT UNLESS HE SEARCHED FOR IT ON PURPOSE ON THE SECOND NIGHT LOAYSA PASSED IN THE TOOLS LUIS WENT TO WORK WITH THEM WHIPPED OFF THE STAPLE IN A TRICE OPENED THE DOOR AND LET IN HIS ORPHEUS
5913-40745-0109 WITH SUCH A DISTORTED LEG AND IN SUCH A TATTERED PLIGHT LOAYSA DID NOT WEAR THE PATCH OVER HIS EYE FOR IT WAS NOT NECESSARY AND AS SOON AS HE ENTERED HE EMBRACED HIS PUPIL
5913-40745-0110 A BOX OF PRESERVES AND OTHER SWEET THINGS WITH WHICH HIS WALLET WAS WELL STORED THEN THROWING ASIDE HIS CRUTCHES HE BEGAN TO CUT CAPERS AS IF NOTHING AILED HIM TO THE STILL GREATER AMAZEMENT OF THE NEGRO
5913-40745-0111 YOU MUST KNOW BROTHER LUIS SAID LOAYSA THAT MY LAMENESS DOES NOT COME OF NATURAL INFIRMITY BUT FROM MY OWN INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY I GET MY BREAD ASKING ALMS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD IN THIS WAY
5913-40745-0112 AND WITH THE HELP OF MY MUSIC I LEAD THE MERRIEST LIFE IN THE WORLD WHERE OTHERS WITH LESS CLEVERNESS AND GOOD MANAGEMENT WOULD BE STARVED TO DEATH OF THIS YOU WILL BE CONVINCED IN THE COURSE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP WE SHALL SEE SAID THE NEGRO
5913-40745-0113 BUT NOW LET US PUT THIS STAPLE BACK IN ITS PLACE SO THAT IT MAY NOT APPEAR THAT IT HAS BEEN MOVED VERY GOOD SAID LOAYSA AND TAKING OUT SOME NAILS FROM HIS WALLET HE SOON MADE THE LOCK SEEM AS SECURE AS EVER TO THE GREAT SATISFACTION OF THE NEGRO
5913-40745-0114 WHO TAKING HIM AT ONCE TO HIS LOFT MADE HIM AS COMFORTABLE THERE AS HE COULD LUIS LIGHTED A LAMP LOAYSA TOOK UP HIS GUITAR AND BEGAN TO STRIKE THE CHORDS SOFTLY AND SWEETLY SO THAT THE POOR NEGRO WAS TRANSPORTED WITH DELIGHT
5913-40745-0115 HE DREW FORTH A FRESH SUPPLY OF GOOD THINGS FOR A COLLATION WHICH THEY PARTOOK OF TOGETHER AND THE PUPIL APPLIED HIMSELF SO EARNESTLY TO THE BOTTLE
5913-40745-0116 SO PERSUADED WAS THE POOR FELLOW OF THIS THAT HE DID NOTHING ALL NIGHT BUT JANGLE AND STRUM AWAY THEY HAD BUT A SHORT SLEEP THAT NIGHT IN THE MORNING JUST ON THE STRIKE OF SIX CARRIZALES CAME DOWN OPENED BOTH ENTRANCE DOORS
5913-40745-0117 AFTER DEPOSITING THE DAY'S SUPPLIES IN THE TURNING BOX CALLED THE NEGRO DOWN TO RECEIVE HIS RATION AND OATS FOR THE MULE AFTER THE PURVEYOR WAS GONE OLD CARRIZALES WENT OUT LOCKING BOTH DOORS AFTER HIM WITHOUT HAVING SEEN WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO THE LOCK OF ONE OF THEM
5913-40745-0118 WHEREAT BOTH MASTER AND PUPIL REJOICED NOT A LITTLE
5913-40745-0119 THAN THE NEGRO LAID HOLD ON THE GUITAR AND BEGAN TO SCRAPE IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ALL THE SERVANT MAIDS CAME TO THE SECOND DOOR AND ASKED HIM THROUGH THE TURNING BOX WHAT IS THIS LUIS HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD A GUITAR WHO GAVE IT YOU
5913-40745-0120 BUT WHERE CAN HE BE FOR US TO SEE HIM RETURNED THE DUENA SINCE NO ONE BUT OUR MASTER EVER ENTERS THIS HOUSE I WILL NOT TELL YOU ANY MORE ABOUT THE MATTER TILL YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT I CAN DO AND HOW MUCH HE HAS TAUGHT ME IN THIS SHORT TIME
5913-40745-0121 BY MY TROTH UNLESS HE IS A DEMON WHO HAS TAUGHT YOU I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HAVE BECOME A MUSICIAN ALL AT ONCE STOP A BIT AND YOU SHALL HEAR HIM AND MAYHAP YOU WILL SEE HIM TOO SOME DAY THAT CAN'T BE SAID ANOTHER OF THE WOMEN
5913-40745-0122 NEVER MIND SAID THE NEGRO THERE'S A REMEDY FOR EVERYTHING BUT DEATH IF YOU ONLY COULD OR WOULD KEEP SILENCE KEEP SILENCE AY THAT WE WILL BROTHER LUIS AS IF WE WERE BORN DUMB
5913-40745-0123 I GIVE YOU MY WORD FRIEND I AM DYING TO HEAR A GOOD VOICE FOR EVER SINCE WE HAVE BEEN SHUT UP HERE WE HAVE NOT EVEN HEARD THE BIRDS SING
5913-40745-0124 LOAYSA LISTENED WITH GREAT INWARD GLEE TO THIS CONVERSATION WHICH SHOWED HOW READILY THE WOMEN WERE TAKING THE VERY BENT HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM THE NEGRO WAS AFRAID LEST HIS MASTER SHOULD RETURN AND CATCH HIM TALKING WITH THEM
5913-40745-0125 WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECTED IT HE WOULD CALL THEM TO HEAR A CAPITAL VOICE HE THEN RETREATED TO HIS LOFT
5913-40745-0126 BUT DURST NOT DO SO BY DAY FOR FEAR OF DETECTION HIS MASTER RETURNED SOON AFTER AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE LOCKING BOTH DOORS BEHIND HIM AS USUAL WHEN LUIS WENT THAT DAY TO THE TURNING BOX FOR HIS VICTUALS
5913-40745-0127 TO LET HER FELLOW SERVANTS KNOW THAT WHEN THEIR MASTER WAS ASLEEP THAT NIGHT THEY SHOULD ALL OF THEM COME DOWN TO THE TURNING BOX WHEN HE WOULD BE SURE TO GIVE THEM THE TREAT HE HAD PROMISED HE WAS ENABLED TO SAY SO MUCH HAVING PREVIOUSLY ENTREATED HIS MUSIC MASTER TO CONDESCEND
5913-40745-0128 TO SING AND PLAY THAT NIGHT BEFORE THE INNER DOOR FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE WOMEN THE MAESTRO SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE PRESSED VERY HARD TO DO THE THING HE MOST DESIRED BUT AFTER MUCH SEEMING RELUCTANCE HE AT LAST YIELDED TO THE SOLICITATIONS OF HIS ESTEEMED PUPIL
5913-40745-0129 IN TESTIMONY OF HIS GRATEFUL SENSE OF THE PROMISED FAVOUR
5913-40745-0130 OR PERHAPS BETTER TOWARDS MIDNIGHT LUIS KNEW BY THE SIGNALS CAUTIOUSLY GIVEN AT THE TURNING BOX THAT THE WOMEN WERE ALL THERE
5913-40745-0131 COMPLETE IN ALL ITS STRINGS AND WELL TUNED THE MAESTRO ASKED HOW MANY WERE THERE TO HEAR HIM
5913-40745-0132 WHO WAS IN BED WITH HER HUSBAND THIS WAS NOT WHAT LOAYSA WISHED FOR NEVERTHELESS
5913-40745-0133 HE TOUCHED THE GUITAR SOFTLY AND DREW FROM IT SUCH TONES AS RAVISHED THE EARS OF HIS AUDIENCE BUT WHO COULD DESCRIBE THE DELIGHT OF THE WOMEN WHEN HE SANG PESAME DE ELLO AND FOLLOWED IT UP WITH THE MAGIC STRAINS OF THE SARABAND THEN NEW IN SPAIN
5913-40745-0134 THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM THAT DID NOT KEEP TIME TO THE MUSIC AS IF SHE WERE DANCING LIKE MAD
5913-40745-0135 KEEPING SCOUTS ON THE WATCH TO WARN THEM IF THE OLD MAN AWOKE
5913-40745-0136 AND SO PUT THE CLIMAX TO HIS SUCCESS THAT THEY ALL EAGERLY BEGGED THE NEGRO TO TELL THEM WHO WAS THIS MARVELLOUS MUSICIAN LUIS REPLIED THAT HE WAS A POOR BEGGAR
5913-40745-0137 BUT THE MOST GALLANT AND GENTEEL MAN IN ALL THE BACK SLUMS OF SEVILLE THEY CONJURED THE NEGRO TO CONTRIVE SOME MEANS THAT THEY MIGHT SEE HIM AND NOT TO LET HIM QUIT THE HOUSE FOR A FORTNIGHT
5913-40745-0138 THEY WERE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW LUIS HAD MANAGED TO GET HIM INTO THE HOUSE BUT TO THIS THE NEGRO MADE NO REPLY FOR THE REST HE TOLD THEM THAT IF THEY WANTED TO SEE THE MAESTRO THEY MIGHT BORE A SMALL HOLE IN THE TURNING BOX
5913-40745-0139 HE WOULD DO HIS BEST LOAYSA THEN ADDRESSED THEM AND OFFERED THEM HIS SERVICES IN SUCH OBLIGING AND POLITE TERMS THAT THEY WERE SURE SUCH FINE LANGUAGE NEVER CAME OUT OF THE HEAD OF A POOR BEGGAR THEY ENTREATED HE WOULD COME THE NEXT NIGHT
5913-40745-0140 AND THEY WOULD PREVAIL ON THEIR LADY TO COME DOWN AND HEAR HIM IN SPITE OF THE LIGHT SLEEP OF HER LORD AND MASTER THE RESULT NOT SO MUCH OF HIS AGE AS OF HIS EXTREME JEALOUSY LOAYSA REPLIED THAT
5913-40745-0141 HE WOULD GIVE THEM A POWDER TO PUT IN HIS WINE
5913-40745-0142 IT WOULD NOT BE A SLEEPING POWDER FOR HIM

5913-40745-0147 IT IS OF SUCH A NATURE THAT IT DOES NO HARM TO THE PERSON WHO TAKES IT THE ONLY EFFECT OF IT BEING TO CAUSE A MOST PROFOUND SLEEP THEY ALL ENTREATED HIM TO BRING IT WITHOUT DELAY AND THEN THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE OF HIM
5913-40745-0148 AFTER AGREEING THAT ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THEY WOULD MAKE A HOLE IN THE TURNING BOX WITH A GIMLET AND THAT THEY WOULD TRY AND PERSUADE THEIR MISTRESS TO COME DOWN BY THIS TIME IT WAS NEARLY DAYLIGHT YET THE NEGRO WISHED TO TAKE A LESSON
5913-40745-0149 LOAYSA COMPLIED WITH HIS DESIRE AND ASSURED HIM THAT AMONG ALL THE PUPILS HE HAD EVER TAUGHT HE HAD NOT KNOWN ONE WITH A FINER EAR AND YET THE POOR NEGRO COULD NEVER TO THE END OF HIS DAYS HAVE LEARNED THE GAMUT
5913-40745-0150 LOAYSA'S FRIENDS TOOK CARE TO COME AT NIGHT TO CARRIZALES DOOR TO SEE IF THEIR FRIEND HAD ANY INSTRUCTIONS TO GIVE THEM OR WANTED ANYTHING ON THE SECOND NIGHT WHEN THEY HAD MADE HIM AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE BY A PRECONCERTED SIGNAL
