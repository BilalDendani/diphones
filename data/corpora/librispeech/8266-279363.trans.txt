8266-279363-0000 COLONEL WOODVILLE HAD BEGUN TO SWEAR IT WAS NOT THE TORRENT OF LOUD IMPRECATION THAT DICK HAD HEARD IN JACKSON BUT SUBDUED AND ALL THE MORE FIERCE BECAUSE IT WAS SO LIKE THE FEROCIOUS WHINE OF A POWERFUL AND HURT WILD ANIMAL SWEARING WAS COMMON ENOUGH AMONG THE OLDER MEN OF THE SOUTH
8266-279363-0001 EVEN AMONG THE EDUCATED BUT COLONEL WOODVILLE NOW SURPASSED THEM ALL DICK HEARD OATHS RIPE AND RICH ENTIRELY NEW TO HIM AND HE HEARD THE OLD ONES IN NEW ARRANGEMENTS AND WITH NEW INFLECTIONS AND YET THERE WAS NO BLASPHEMY ABOUT IT
8266-279363-0002 IT SEEMED A PART OF TIME AND PLACE AND WHAT WAS MORE IT SEEMED NATURAL COMING FROM THE LIPS OF THE OLD COLONEL THEY REACHED THE DOOR THE CUT IN THE SIDE OF THE RAVINE AND AT ONCE A WIDE PORTION OF THE BATTLEFIELD SPRANG INTO THE LIGHT WHILE THE ROAR OF THE GUNS WAS REDOUBLED
8266-279363-0003 I WILL NEVERTHELESS SEE THE CHASE AND EVEN IF I AM AN OLD HOUND I COULD RUN WITH THE BEST OF THEM IF THAT INFERNAL YANKEE BULLET HAD NOT TAKEN ME IN THE LEG MISS WOODVILLE BROUGHT HIM THE GLASSES A POWERFUL PAIR AND HE GLUED THEM INSTANTLY TO HIS EYES
8266-279363-0004 DICK SAW ONLY THE FIELD OF BATTLE DARK LINES AND BLURS THE RED FLARE OF CANNON AND RIFLE FIRE AND TOWERS AND BANKS OF SMOKE BUT THE COLONEL SAW INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEINGS AND WITH HIS TRAINED MILITARY EYE HE KNEW WHAT THE MOVEMENTS MEANT
8266-279363-0005 DICK FELT THE HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT HE WAS EXCITED HIMSELF MISS WOODVILLE STOOD JUST BEHIND THEM AND A FAINT TINGE OF COLOR APPEARED IN HER PALE FACE THE YANKEES ARE GETTING READY TO CHARGE SAID THE COLONEL
8266-279363-0006 AND THEIR RIFLES MAKE SHEETS OF FLAME ALL THE TIME THE CANNON ARE FIRING OVER THEIR HEADS HEAVENS WHAT A BOMBARDMENT I'VE NEVER BEFORE LISTENED TO ITS LIKE
8266-279363-0007 ASKED MISS WOODVILLE VERY LITTLE YET AND THEY SHOULD DO LITTLE PEMBERTON IS SHOWING MORE JUDGMENT THAN I EXPECTED OF HIM THE DEFENSE SHOULD HOLD ITS FIRE UNTIL THE ENEMY IS WELL WITHIN RANGE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING THE COLONEL LEANED A LITTLE MORE HEAVILY UPON HIM BUT DICK STEADIED HIMSELF
8266-279363-0008 THE OLD MAN STILL KEPT THE GLASSES TO HIS EYES AND SWEPT THEM BACK AND FORTH IN AS WIDE AN ARC AS THEIR POSITION PERMITTED THE HILLS SHOOK WITH THE THUNDER OF THE CANNON AND THE BRILLIANT SUN PIERCING THROUGH THE SMOKE LIGHTED UP THE VAST BATTLE LINE
8266-279363-0009 THE ATTACK OF THE SKIRMISHERS GROWS HOTTER SAID THE OLD MAN THE THICKETS BLAZE WITH THE FIRE OF THEIR RIFLES HEAVY MASSES OF INFANTRY ARE MOVING FORWARD NOW THEY STOP AND LIE ON THEIR ARMS
8266-279363-0010 THEY ARE AWAITING THE WORD FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE FIELD AND IT SHOWS WITH CERTAINTY THAT A GRAND ATTACK IS COMING TWO BATTERIES OF EIGHT GUNS EACH HAVE COME NEARER I DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRE OF THEIR CANNON TO INCREASE BUT IT HAS DONE SO YOUNG SIR WOULD YOU CARE TO LOOK THROUGH THE GLASSES
8266-279363-0011 I BELIEVE NOT COLONEL I WILL TRUST TO THE NAKED EYE AND YOUR REPORT IT WAS AN ODD FEELING THAT MADE DICK DECLINE THE GLASSES IF HE LOOKED HE MUST TELL TO THE OTHERS WHAT HE SAW AND HE WISHED TO SHOW NEITHER EXULTATION NOR DEPRESSION
8266-279363-0012 THE COLONEL THE DUTY OF COURTESY DISCHARGED RESUMED HIS OWN POSITION OF WITNESS AND HERALD THE COLUMNS OF INFANTRY ARE GETTING UP AGAIN HE SAID I SEE A MAN IN WHAT I TAKE TO BE A GENERAL'S UNIFORM RIDING ALONG THEIR FRONT HE MUST BE MAKING A SPEECH
8266-279363-0013 NO DOUBT HE KNOWS THE DESPERATE NATURE OF THE ATTACK AND WOULD INSPIRE THEM NOW HE IS GONE AND OTHER OFFICERS COLONELS AND MAJORS ARE MOVING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE SKIRMISHERS DOING COLONEL THEIR FIRE IS NOT SO HOT THEY MUST BE DRAWING BACK
8266-279363-0014 THEY HAVE MADE THE PRELUDE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR ROLE HAS PASSED THE MASSES OF INFANTRY ARE DRAWING TOGETHER AGAIN NOW I SEE MEN ON HORSEBACK WITH TRUMPETS TO THEIR LIPS YES THE CHARGE IS COMING
8266-279363-0015 THERE WAS A TERRIFIC CRASH MUCH NEARER AND DICK KNEW THAT IT WAS THE SOUTHERN BATTERIES OPENING FIRE THE SHOULDER UPON WHICH THE COLONEL'S HAND RESTED SHOOK A LITTLE BUT IT WAS FROM EXCITEMENT HE SAID NOTHING AND COLONEL WOODVILLE CONTINUED THE SMOKE IS SO HEAVY I CAN'T SEE WHAT DAMAGE WAS DONE
8266-279363-0016 THERE ARE GAPS IN THE YANKEE LINES BUT THE MEN HAVE CLOSED UP AND THEY COME ON AT THE DOUBLE QUICK WITH THEIR CANNON STILL FIRING OVER THEIR HEADS IN HIS EXCITEMENT HE TOOK HIS HAND OFF DICK'S SHOULDER AND LEANED FORWARD A LITTLE FARTHER SUPPORTING HIMSELF NOW AGAINST THE EARTHEN WALL DICK STOOD JUST BEHIND HIM
8266-279363-0017 SHIELDED FROM THE SIGHT OF ANY ONE WHO MIGHT BE PASSING IN THE RAVINE ALTHOUGH THERE WAS LITTLE DANGER NOW FROM SEARCHERS WITH A GREAT BATTLE GOING ON MEANWHILE HE WATCHED THE COMBAT WITH AN EAGERNESS FULLY EQUAL TO THAT OF THE OLD COLONEL THE MIGHTY CRASH OF CANNON AND RIFLES TOGETHER CONTINUED
8266-279363-0018 BUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE SMOKE BANKED UP IN FRONT SO DENSELY THAT THE WHOLE COMBAT WAS HIDDEN FROM THEM THEN A WIND SLOWLY ROLLED THE SMOKE AWAY THE FIGURES OF THE MEN BEGAN TO APPEAR LIKE SHADOWY TRACERY AND THEN EMERGED DISTINCT AND SEPARATE FROM THE HAZE
8266-279363-0019 THEY ARE NEARER NOW SAID THE COLONEL I CAN PLAINLY SEE THEIR LONG LINES MOVING AND THEIR LIGHT GUNS COMING WITH THEM BUT OUR BATTERIES ARE RAKING THEM HORRIBLY THEIR MEN ARE FALLING BY THE SCORES AND HUNDREDS MISS WOODVILLE UTTERED A DEEP SIGH AND TURNED HER FACE AWAY
8266-279363-0020 BUT SHE LOOKED AGAIN IN A FEW MOMENTS THE TERRIBLE SPELL WAS UPON HER TOO DICK'S NERVES WERE QUIVERING HIS HEART WAS WITH THE ASSAILANTS AND THEIRS WITH THE ASSAILED BUT HE WOULD NOT SPEAK ALOUD AGAINST THE HOPES OF COLONEL WOODVILLE AND HIS DAUGHTER SINCE HE WAS IN THEIR HOUSE SUCH AS IT WAS
8266-279363-0021 AND IN A MEASURE UNDER THEIR PROTECTION THEIR CHARGE IS SPLENDID CONTINUED THE COLONEL AND I HOPE PEMBERTON HAS MADE FULL USE OF THE GROUND FOR DEFENSE HE WILL NEED ALL THE HELP HE CAN GET OH TO BE OUT OF THE BATTLE ON SUCH A DAY
8266-279363-0022 THE SMOKE IS IN THE WAY AGAIN AND I CAN SEE NOTHING NOW IT HAS PASSED AND THE ENEMY IS STILL ADVANCING BUT OUR FIRE GROWS HOTTER AND HOTTER THE SHELLS AND THE GRAPE AND THE CANISTER AND THE BULLETS ARE SMASHING THROUGH THEM THEY CANNOT LIVE UNDER IT THEY MUST GO BACK
8266-279363-0023 NEVERTHELESS THE BLUE LINES CAME STEADILY TOWARD THE SOUTHERN EARTHWORKS DICK SAW OFFICERS SOME AHORSE AND SOME AFOOT RUSHING ABOUT AND ENCOURAGING THE MEN AND HE SAW MANY FALL AND LIE STILL WHILE THE REGIMENTS PASSED ON
8266-279363-0024 THEY ARE IN THE NEARER THICKETS CRIED THE COLONEL AND NOW THEY'RE CLIMBING THE SLOPES AH YOU RIFLEMEN YOUR TARGET IS THERE THE NORTHERN ARMY WAS SO NEAR NOW THAT THE SOUTHERN RIFLE FIRE WAS BEATING UPON IT LIKE A STORM NEVER FLINCHING THE MEN OF THE WEST AND NORTHWEST
8266-279363-0025 AND REACHED THE EARS OF THOSE IN THE RAVINE THE OMEN OF VICTORY EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL EXULTANTLY OUR BRAVE LADS FEEL THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO TRIUMPH GRANT CAN'T BREAK THROUGH OUR LINE WHY DOESN'T HE CALL OFF HIS MEN IT'S SLAUGHTER DICK'S HEART SANK
8266-279363-0026 HE KNEW THAT THE COLONEL'S WORDS WERE TRUE THE SOUTHERN ARMY POSTED IN ITS DEFENSES WAS BREAKING THE RING OF STEEL THAT SOUGHT TO CRUSH IT TO DEATH GROUPS OF MEN IN BLUE WHO HAD SEIZED GROUND IN THE VERY FRONT OF THE DEFENSES EITHER DIED THERE OR WERE GRADUALLY DRIVEN BACK
8266-279363-0027 THE ATTACK HAS FAILED AND THE SOUTH HAS WON A VICTORY BUT GRANT WILL COME AGAIN SAID DICK SPEAKING HIS OPINION FOR THE FIRST TIME NO DOUBT OF IT SAID COLONEL WOODVILLE BUT LIKELY HE WILL COME TO THE SAME FATE HE SPOKE WHOLLY WITHOUT ANIMOSITY
8266-279363-0028 THE BATTLE NOW DIED FAST THE MEN IN GRAY HAD BEEN INVINCIBLE THEIR CANNON AND RIFLES HAD MADE AN IMPENETRABLE BARRIER OF FIRE AND GRANT DESPITE THE VALOR OF HIS TROOPS HAD BEEN FORCED TO DRAW OFF MANY THOUSANDS HAD FALLEN AND THE SOUTHERN GENERALS WERE EXULTANT
8266-279363-0029 JOHNSTON WOULD COME UP AND GRANT HAVING SUCH HEAVY LOSSES WOULD BE UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE UNITED CONFEDERATE ARMIES BUT GRANT AS COLONEL WOODVILLE FORESAW HAD NO IDEA OF RETREATING FRESH TROOPS WERE POURING DOWN THE GREAT RIVER FOR HIM
8266-279363-0030 AND WHILE HE WOULD NOT AGAIN ATTEMPT TO STORM VICKSBURG THE RING OF STEEL AROUND IT WOULD BE MADE SO BROAD AND STRONG THAT PEMBERTON COULD NOT GET OUT NOR COULD JOHNSTON GET IN WHEN THE LAST CANNON SHOT ECHOED OVER THE FAR HILLS COLONEL WOODVILLE TURNED AWAY FROM THE DOOR OF HIS HILLSIDE HOME
8266-279363-0031 I MUST ASK YOUR SHOULDER AGAIN YOUNG SIR HE SAID TO DICK WHAT I HAVE SEEN REJOICES ME GREATLY BUT I DO NOT SAY IT TO TAUNT YOU IN WAR IF ONE WINS THE OTHER MUST LOSE AND BEAR IN MIND THAT YOU ARE THE INVADER
8266-279363-0032 ASKED DICK YOU MAY YOU ARE A GOOD YOUNG MAN I'M GLAD I SAVED YOU FROM THAT SCOUNDREL SLADE AS THE SCORE BETWEEN US IS EVEN I WISH THAT YOU WERE OUT OF VICKSBURG AND WITH YOUR OWN PEOPLE I WAS THINKING TOO SIR THAT I OUGHT TO GO
8266-279363-0033 THE REPULSE HAD STRUCK HIM A HARD BLOW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT GRANT COULD NOT WIN AND IF HE COULD NOT WIN WHAT TERRIBLE RISKS HE WOULD RUN IN THE HEART OF THE CONFEDERACY WITH PERHAPS TWO ARMIES TO FIGHT HE FELT THAT ONLY THE MISSISSIPPI
8266-279363-0034 THAT LIFE LINE CONNECTING HIM WITH THE NORTH COULD SAVE HIM BUT AS DUSK CAME GRADUALLY IN THE RAVINE HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD GO HIS SUPPER AS USUAL WAS BROUGHT TO HIM BY MISS WOODVILLE SHE WAS AS TACITURN AS EVER SPEAKING SCARCELY A HALF DOZEN WORDS
8266-279363-0035 WHEN HE ASKED HER IF VICTOR HAD GONE THROUGH THE BATTLE UNHARMED SHE MERELY NODDED AND PRESENTLY HE WAS ALONE AGAIN WITH THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE GREAT GULLY DICK WAS CONFIDENT THAT NOBODY BUT COLONEL WOODVILLE HIS DAUGHTER AND HIMSELF WERE IN THE CAVE HOME IT WAS BUT A SMALL PLACE
8266-279363-0036 AND NEW CALLOUS PLACES ON HER HANDS INDICATED THAT SHE WAS DOING THE COOKING AND ALL OTHER WORK HIS RESOLVE TO RISK EVERYTHING AND GO WAS STRENGTHENED HE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL THE FULL NIGHT HAD COME AND ONLY THE USUAL SOUNDS OF AN ARMY IN CAMP AROSE THEN HE MADE READY
8266-279363-0037 HE HAD SURRENDERED HIS HOLSTER AND PISTOLS TO COLONEL WOODVILLE AND SO HE MUST ISSUE FORTH UNARMED
8266-279363-0038 HE HAD SEVERAL TEN DOLLAR GOLD PIECES IN HIS POCKET
8266-279363-0039 HE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE MOST WELCOME AND HE COULD NOT CALCULATE HOW MANY HUNDREDS IN CONFEDERACY CURRENCY IT WAS WORTH HE WAS GLAD THAT HE COULD REPAY A LITTLE AT LEAST THEN HE STEPPED LIGHTLY TOWARD THE LARGER CHAMBER IN WHICH COLONEL WOODVILLE LAY
8266-279363-0040 THE USUAL CANDLE WAS BURNING ON THE TABLE NEAR HIS BED BUT THE GREAT BALD HEAD LAY MOTIONLESS ON THE PILLOW AND THE HEAVY WHITE EYEBROWS DROOPED OVER CLOSED LIDS SOUND ASLEEP DICK WAS GLAD OF IT THE COLONEL WITH HIS STRONG LOYALTY TO THE SOUTH
8266-279363-0041 MIGHT SEEK TO HOLD HIM AT LEAST AS HIS PERSONAL PRISONER AND NOW THE TROUBLE WAS AVOIDED HE MOVED GENTLY ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THEN PASSED TOWARD THE OPEN DOOR HOW GOOD THAT PUFF OF FRESH AIR AND FREEDOM FELT ON HIS FACE
8266-279363-0042 DICK STEPPED INTO THE NARROW PATH CUT IN THE SIDE OF THE RAVINE AND INHALED MORE DRAUGHTS OF THE FRESH AIR HOW SWEET AND STRONG IT WAS HOW IT FILLED ONE'S LUNGS AND BROUGHT WITH IT LIFE COURAGE AND CONFIDENCE
8266-279363-0043 THE BLESSED WINDS THAT BLEW ABOUT THE WORLD HE KNEW THAT THE PATH RAN IN FRONT OF OTHER HOLLOWS DUG IN THE EARTH AND HE FELT SORRY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COMPELLED TO BURROW IN THEM HE FELT SORRY IN TRUTH FOR ALL VICKSBURG BECAUSE NOW THAT HE WAS OUTSIDE HIS FEARS FOR GRANT DISAPPEARED
8266-279363-0044 AND HE KNEW THAT HE MUST WIN WHILE HE REMAINED IN THE PATH A DEEP BOOM CAME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE UNION ARMY AND A HUGE SHELL BURST OVER THE TOWN IT WAS FOLLOWED IN A MOMENT BY ANOTHER AND THEN BY MANY OTHERS WHILE THE BESIEGED REJOICED IN VICTORY
8266-279363-0045 AND PROCEEDED TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE TOWN HE JUDGED THAT IN THE HOURS FOLLOWING A GREAT BATTLE WHILE THERE WAS YET MUCH CONFUSION HE WOULD FIND HIS BEST CHANCE HE HAD RECKONED RIGHTLY THERE WAS A GREAT PASSING TO AND FRO IN VICKSBURG BUT ITS LIGHTS WERE DIM
8266-279363-0046 OIL AND CANDLES ALIKE WERE SCARCE AND THERE WAS LITTLE BUT THE MOON'S RAYS TO DISCLOSE A TOWN TO THE EYE THE REJOICINGS OVER THE VICTORY HAD BROUGHT MORE PEOPLE THAN USUAL INTO THE STREETS BUT THE SAME EXULTATION MADE THEM UNSUSPICIOUS AND DICK GLIDED AMONG THEM IN THE DUSK ALMOST WITHOUT FEAR
8266-279363-0047 HE HAD CONCLUDED THAT THE LONGEST WAY AROUND WAS THE SHORTEST WAY THROUGH AND HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARD THE RIVER HE HAD FORMED A CLEAR PLAN AT LAST AND HE BELIEVED THAT IT WOULD SUCCEED TWISTING AND TURNING ALWAYS KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS HE MADE GOOD PROGRESS
8266-279363-0048 DESCENDED THE BLUFF AND AT LAST STOOD BEHIND THE RUINS OF AN OLD WAREHOUSE NEAR THE STREAM SOUTHERN BATTERIES WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM HIM AND HE HEARD THE MEN TALKING THEN STRENGTHENING HIS RESOLUTION HE CAME FROM BEHIND THE RUINS FLUNG HIMSELF ALMOST FLAT ON THE GROUND AND CRAWLED TOWARD THE RIVER
8266-279363-0049 A HAIL CAME AND DICK FLATTENED HIMSELF AGAINST THE GROUND AND LAY PERFECTLY STILL EVIDENTLY THE SENTINEL WAS SATISFIED THAT HIS FANCY HAD BEEN MAKING MERRY WITH HIM AS HE DID NOT LOOK FURTHER AT THE SHADOW AND DICK AFTER WAITING TWO OR THREE MINUTES RESUMED HIS SLOW CREEPING
