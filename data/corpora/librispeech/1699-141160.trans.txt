1699-141160-0000 BUT THEY HAD NOW ALL BEEN REMOVED EVEN THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE GUANACOS HAD DECAMPED KNOWING WELL THAT IF OVERTAKEN HERE BY A SNOW STORM THEY WOULD BE CAUGHT IN A TRAP WE HAD A FINE VIEW OF A MASS OF MOUNTAINS CALLED TUPUNGATO THE WHOLE CLOTHED WITH UNBROKEN SNOW
1699-141160-0001 A CIRCUMSTANCE OF RARE OCCURRENCE IN THESE MOUNTAINS NOW COMMENCED A HEAVY AND LONG CLIMB SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PEUQUENES BOLD CONICAL HILLS OF RED GRANITE ROSE ON EACH HAND IN THE VALLEYS THERE WERE SEVERAL BROAD FIELDS OF PERPETUAL SNOW
1699-141160-0002 THESE FROZEN MASSES DURING THE PROCESS OF THAWING
1699-141160-0003 BUT WITH ITS HIND LEGS STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR
1699-141160-0004 WHEN THE SNOW WAS CONTINUOUS AND AFTERWARDS THE SURROUNDING PARTS MUST HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY THE THAW WHEN NEARLY ON THE CREST OF THE PORTILLO WE WERE ENVELOPED IN A FALLING CLOUD OF MINUTE FROZEN SPICULA THIS WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE
1699-141160-0005 AS IT CONTINUED THE WHOLE DAY AND QUITE INTERCEPTED OUR VIEW THE PASS TAKES ITS NAME OF PORTILLO FROM A NARROW CLEFT OR DOORWAY ON THE HIGHEST RIDGE THROUGH WHICH THE ROAD PASSES FROM THIS POINT ON A CLEAR DAY THOSE VAST PLAINS WHICH UNINTERRUPTEDLY EXTEND TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN CAN BE SEEN
1699-141160-0006 WE DESCENDED TO THE UPPER LIMIT OF VEGETATION AND FOUND GOOD QUARTERS FOR THE NIGHT UNDER THE SHELTER OF SOME LARGE FRAGMENTS OF ROCK WE MET HERE SOME PASSENGERS WHO MADE ANXIOUS INQUIRIES ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ROAD SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS DARK THE CLOUDS SUDDENLY CLEARED AWAY
1699-141160-0007 THE GREAT MOUNTAINS BRIGHT WITH THE FULL MOON SEEMED IMPENDING OVER US ON ALL SIDES AS OVER A DEEP CREVICE ONE MORNING VERY EARLY I WITNESSED THE SAME STRIKING EFFECT AS SOON AS THE CLOUDS WERE DISPERSED IT FROZE SEVERELY
1699-141160-0008 BUT AS THERE WAS NO WIND WE SLEPT VERY COMFORTABLY
1699-141160-0009 OWING TO THE PERFECT TRANSPARENCY OF THE ATMOSPHERE WAS VERY REMARKABLE TRAVELERS HAVING OBSERVED THE DIFFICULTY OF JUDGING HEIGHTS AND DISTANCES AMIDST LOFTY MOUNTAINS HAVE GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTS OF COMPARISON
1699-141160-0010 IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IT IS FULLY AS MUCH OWING TO THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE AIR CONFOUNDING OBJECTS AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES AND LIKEWISE PARTLY TO THE NOVELTY OF AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF FATIGUE ARISING FROM A LITTLE EXERTION HABIT BEING THUS OPPOSED TO THE EVIDENCE OF THE SENSES
1699-141160-0011 I AM SURE THAT THIS EXTREME CLEARNESS OF THE AIR GIVES A PECULIAR CHARACTER TO THE LANDSCAPE ALL OBJECTS APPEARING TO BE BROUGHT NEARLY INTO ONE PLANE AS IN A DRAWING OR PANORAMA THE TRANSPARENCY IS I PRESUME
1699-141160-0012 OWING TO THE EQUABLE AND HIGH STATE OF ATMOSPHERIC DRYNESS THIS DRYNESS WAS SHOWN BY THE MANNER IN WHICH WOODWORK SHRANK
1699-141160-0013 BY ARTICLES OF FOOD SUCH AS BREAD AND SUGAR BECOMING EXTREMELY HARD AND BY THE PRESERVATION OF THE SKIN AND PARTS OF THE FLESH OF THE BEASTS WHICH HAD PERISHED ON THE ROAD
1699-141160-0014 TO THE SAME CAUSE WE MUST ATTRIBUTE THE SINGULAR FACILITY WITH WHICH ELECTRICITY IS EXCITED MY FLANNEL WAISTCOAT
1699-141160-0015 EVERY HAIR ON A DOG'S BACK CRACKLED EVEN THE LINEN SHEETS AND LEATHERN STRAPS OF THE SADDLE WHEN HANDLED EMITTED SPARKS
1699-141160-0016 IN OTHER WORDS THE MOUNTAINS RISE MORE ABRUPTLY FROM THE PLAINS THAN FROM THE ALPINE COUNTRY OF CHILE A LEVEL AND BRILLIANTLY WHITE SEA OF CLOUDS WAS STRETCHED OUT BENEATH OUR FEET SHUTTING OUT THE VIEW OF THE EQUALLY LEVEL PAMPAS
1699-141160-0017 WE SOON ENTERED THE BAND OF CLOUDS AND DID NOT AGAIN EMERGE FROM IT THAT DAY
1699-141160-0018 WE STOPPED FOR THE NIGHT THIS WAS NEAR THE UPPERMOST LIMIT OF BUSHES AND THE ELEVATION I SUPPOSE WAS BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT THOUSAND FEET I WAS MUCH STRUCK WITH THE MARKED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VEGETATION OF THESE EASTERN VALLEYS AND THOSE ON THE CHILIAN SIDE
1699-141160-0019 AND THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE VERY TRIFLING THE SAME REMARK HOLDS GOOD WITH THE QUADRUPEDS AND IN A LESSER DEGREE WITH THE BIRDS AND INSECTS
1699-141160-0020 AND NOT ONE OF THEM IS IDENTICAL WE MUST EXCEPT ALL THOSE SPECIES WHICH HABITUALLY OR OCCASIONALLY FREQUENT ELEVATED MOUNTAINS AND CERTAIN BIRDS WHICH RANGE AS FAR SOUTH AS THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN THIS FACT IS IN PERFECT ACCORDANCE WITH THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE ANDES
1699-141160-0021 WE OUGHT NOT TO EXPECT ANY CLOSER SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE ORGANIC BEINGS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ANDES THAN ON THE OPPOSITE SHORES OF THE OCEAN IN BOTH CASES WE MUST LEAVE OUT OF THE QUESTION THOSE KINDS WHICH HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CROSS THE BARRIER
1699-141160-0022 WHETHER OF SOLID ROCK OR SALT WATER FIVE A
1699-141160-0023 OR MOST CLOSELY ALLIED TO THOSE OF PATAGONIA
1699-141160-0024 THREE SPECIES OF ARMADILLO THE OSTRICH CERTAIN KINDS OF PARTRIDGES AND OTHER BIRDS NONE OF WHICH ARE EVER SEEN IN CHILE BUT ARE THE CHARACTERISTIC ANIMALS OF THE DESERT PLAINS OF PATAGONIA WE HAVE LIKEWISE MANY OF THE SAME
1699-141160-0025 THORNY STUNTED BUSHES WITHERED GRASS AND DWARF PLANTS EVEN THE BLACK SLOWLY CRAWLING BEETLES ARE CLOSELY SIMILAR AND SOME I BELIEVE ON RIGOROUS EXAMINATION ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL
1699-141160-0026 BUT I NOW FEEL SURE THAT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE PLAINS OF PATAGONIA UP A MOUNTAINOUS ASCENT
1699-141160-0027 AND ENJOYED A FAR EXTENDED VIEW OVER THE PAMPAS THIS WAS A SPECTACLE TO WHICH I HAD ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD WITH INTEREST BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT MUCH RESEMBLED A DISTANT VIEW OF THE OCEAN BUT IN THE NORTHERN PARTS MANY IRREGULARITIES WERE SOON DISTINGUISHABLE
1699-141160-0028 THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE CONSISTED IN THE RIVERS WHICH FACING THE RISING SUN GLITTERED LIKE SILVER THREADS TILL LOST IN THE IMMENSITY OF THE DISTANCE AT MIDDAY WE DESCENDED THE VALLEY AND REACHED A HOVEL
1699-141160-0029 ONE OF THESE MEN WAS A THOROUGHBRED PAMPAS INDIAN HE WAS KEPT MUCH FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AS A BLOODHOUND TO TRACK OUT ANY PERSON WHO MIGHT PASS BY SECRETLY EITHER ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK SOME YEARS AGO A PASSENGER ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE DETECTION
1699-141160-0030 BY MAKING A LONG CIRCUIT OVER A NEIGHBOURING MOUNTAIN BUT THIS INDIAN HAVING BY CHANCE CROSSED HIS TRACK FOLLOWED IT FOR THE WHOLE DAY OVER DRY AND VERY STONY HILLS TILL AT LAST HE CAME ON HIS PREY HIDDEN IN A GULLY
1699-141160-0031 WE HERE HEARD THAT THE SILVERY CLOUDS WHICH WE HAD ADMIRED FROM THE BRIGHT REGION ABOVE HAD POURED DOWN TORRENTS OF RAIN THE VALLEY FROM THIS POINT GRADUALLY OPENED AND THE HILLS BECAME MERE WATER WORN HILLOCKS COMPARED TO THE GIANTS BEHIND
1699-141160-0032 IT THEN EXPANDED INTO A GENTLY SLOPING PLAIN OF SHINGLE COVERED WITH LOW TREES AND BUSHES THIS TALUS ALTHOUGH APPEARING NARROW MUST BE NEARLY TEN MILES WIDE BEFORE IT BLENDS INTO THE APPARENTLY DEAD LEVEL PAMPAS WE PASSED THE ONLY HOUSE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
1699-141160-0033 AND AT SUNSET WE PULLED UP IN THE FIRST SNUG CORNER AND THERE BIVOUACKED
1699-141160-0034 INTERSECTED BY AN HORIZON LEVEL AS THAT OF THE OCEAN DURING THE NIGHT A HEAVY DEW FELL A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WE DID NOT EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE CORDILLERA THE ROAD PROCEEDED FOR SOME DISTANCE DUE EAST ACROSS A LOW SWAMP THEN MEETING THE DRY PLAIN
1699-141160-0035 IT TURNED TO THE NORTH TOWARDS MENDOZA THE DISTANCE IS TWO VERY LONG DAYS JOURNEY OUR FIRST DAY'S JOURNEY WAS CALLED FOURTEEN LEAGUES TO ESTACADO AND THE SECOND SEVENTEEN TO LUXAN NEAR MENDOZA
1699-141160-0036 THE WHOLE DISTANCE IS OVER A LEVEL DESERT PLAIN WITH NOT MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOUSES THE SUN WAS EXCEEDINGLY POWERFUL AND THE RIDE DEVOID OF ALL INTEREST THERE IS VERY LITTLE WATER IN THIS TRAVERSIA
1699-141160-0037 AND IN OUR SECOND DAY'S JOURNEY WE FOUND ONLY ONE LITTLE POOL LITTLE WATER FLOWS FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND IT SOON BECOMES ABSORBED BY THE DRY AND POROUS SOIL SO THAT ALTHOUGH WE TRAVELLED AT THE DISTANCE OF ONLY TEN OR FIFTEEN MILES FROM THE OUTER RANGE OF THE CORDILLERA
1699-141160-0038 WE DID NOT CROSS A SINGLE STREAM IN MANY PARTS THE GROUND WAS INCRUSTED WITH A SALINE EFFLORESCENCE HENCE WE HAD THE SAME SALT LOVING PLANTS WHICH ARE COMMON NEAR BAHIA BLANCA THE LANDSCAPE HAS A UNIFORM CHARACTER FROM THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN
1699-141160-0039 ALONG THE WHOLE EASTERN COAST OF PATAGONIA TO THE RIO COLORADO AND IT APPEARS THAT THE SAME KIND OF COUNTRY EXTENDS INLAND FROM THIS RIVER
1699-141160-0040 TO THE EASTWARD OF THIS CURVED LINE LIES THE BASIN OF THE COMPARATIVELY DAMP AND GREEN PLAINS OF BUENOS AYRES
