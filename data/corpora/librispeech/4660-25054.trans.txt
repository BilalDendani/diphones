4660-25054-0000 JOCK HAD LEARNED ONE VERY CLEVER TRICK IN PULLING DOWN WOUNDED ANIMALS
4660-25054-0001 AND THE ONLY CHANCE YOU HAVE OF GETTING ANYTHING IS WITH A RUNNING SHOT IF THEY GO STRAIGHT FROM YOU THE SHOT IS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT ONE ALTHOUGH YOU SEE NOTHING BUT THE LIFTING AND FALLING HIND QUARTERS AS THEY CANTER AWAY AND A COMMON RESULT OF SUCH A SHOT IS THE BREAKING OF ONE OF THE HIND LEGS BETWEEN THE HIP AND THE HOCK
4660-25054-0002 JOCK MADE HIS DISCOVERY WHILE FOLLOWING A RIETBUCK WHICH I HAD WOUNDED IN THIS WAY HE HAD MADE SEVERAL TRIES AT ITS NOSE AND THROAT BUT THE BUCK WAS GOING TOO STRONGLY AND WAS OUT OF REACH MOREOVER IT WOULD NOT STOP OR TURN WHEN HE HEADED IT BUT CHARGED STRAIGHT ON
4660-25054-0003 BOUNDING OVER HIM IN TRYING ONCE MORE FOR THE THROAT HE CANNONED AGAINST THE BUCK'S SHOULDER AND WAS SENT ROLLING YARDS AWAY THIS SEEMED TO MADDEN HIM RACING UP BEHIND HE FLEW AT THE DANGLING LEG CAUGHT IT AT THE SHIN
4660-25054-0004 AND THRUSTING HIS FEET WELL OUT SIMPLY DRAGGED UNTIL THE BUCK SLOWED DOWN AND THEN BEGAN FURIOUSLY TUGGING SIDEWAYS THE CROSSING OF THE LEGS BROUGHT THE WOUNDED ANIMAL DOWN IMMEDIATELY
4660-25054-0005 EVERY ONE WHO IS GOOD AT ANYTHING HAS SOME FAVOURITE METHOD OR DEVICE OF HIS OWN THAT WAS JOCK'S IT MAY HAVE COME TO HIM AS IT COMES TO MANY BY ACCIDENT BUT HAVING ONCE GOT IT HE PERFECTED IT AND USED IT WHENEVER IT WAS POSSIBLE
4660-25054-0006 ONLY ONCE HE MADE A MISTAKE AND HE PAID FOR IT VERY NEARLY WITH HIS LIFE HE HAD ALREADY USED THIS DEVICE SUCCESSFULLY SEVERAL TIMES BUT SO FAR ONLY WITH THE SMALLER BUCK
4660-25054-0007 I LEFT THE SCENE OF TORN CARCASE AND CRUNCHED BONES CONSUMED BY REGRETS AND DISAPPOINTMENT EACH FRESH DETAIL ONLY ADDED TO MY FEELING OF DISGUST BUT JOCK DID NOT SEEM TO MIND
4660-25054-0008 HE JUMPED OUT BRISKLY AS SOON AS I STARTED WALKING IN EARNEST AS THOUGH HE RECOGNISED THAT WE WERE MAKING A FRESH START AND HE BEGAN TO LOOK FORWARD IMMEDIATELY THE LITTLE BARE FLAT WHERE THE KOODOO HAD FALLEN FOR THE LAST TIME
4660-25054-0009 DRY IN WINTER BUT FULL CHARGED WITH MUDDY FLOOD IN SUMMER WHICH DRAIN THE BUSHVELD TO ITS RIVERS HERE AND THERE WHERE AN IMPERMEABLE ROCK FORMATION CROSSES THESE CHANNELS THERE ARE DEEP POOLS WHICH EXCEPT IN YEARS OF DROUGHT LAST ALL THROUGH THE WINTER
4660-25054-0010 AND THESE ARE THE DRINKING PLACES OF THE GAME
4660-25054-0011 AND BEYOND THEM THE ORDINARY SCATTERED THORNS AS I REACHED THIS POINT AND STOPPED TO LOOK OUT BETWEEN THE BUSHES ON TO THE MORE OPEN GROUND A KOODOO COW WALKED QUIETLY UP THE SLOPE FROM THE WATER
4660-25054-0012 BUT BEFORE THERE WAS TIME TO RAISE THE RIFLE HER EASY STRIDE HAD CARRIED HER BEHIND A SMALL MIMOSA TREE I TOOK ONE QUICK STEP OUT TO FOLLOW HER UP AND FOUND MYSELF FACE TO FACE AT LESS THAN A DOZEN YARDS WITH A GRAND KOODOO BULL
4660-25054-0013 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY IN WORDS ANY REAL IDEA OF THE SCENE AND HOW THINGS HAPPENED OF COURSE IT WAS ONLY FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND THAT WE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
4660-25054-0014 BEFORE THE WILDNESS OF PANIC HAD STRICKEN THEM THE PICTURE SEEMS PHOTOGRAPHED ON EYE AND BRAIN NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN A WHIRLWIND OF DUST AND LEAVES MARKED HIS COURSE AND THROUGH IT I FIRED UNSTEADIED BY EXCITEMENT AND HARDLY ABLE TO SEE
4660-25054-0015 THEN THE RIGHT HIND LEG SWUNG OUT AND THE GREAT CREATURE SANK FOR A MOMENT ALMOST TO THE GROUND AND THE SENSE OF TRIUMPH THE LONGED FOR AND UNEXPECTED SUCCESS WENT TO MY HEAD LIKE A RUSH OF BLOOD THERE HAD BEEN NO TIME TO AIM AND THE SHOT A REAL SNAP SHOT
4660-25054-0016 WAS NOT AT ALL A BAD ONE IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT THE NATURAL EFFECT OF SUCH A MEETING AND SUCH A CHANCE BEGAN TO TELL THINKING IT ALL OUT BEFOREHAND DOES NOT HELP MUCH FOR THINGS NEVER HAPPEN AS THEY ARE EXPECTED TO
4660-25054-0017 AND THERE RUNNING HARD AND DROPPING QUICKLY TO MY KNEE FOR STEADIER AIM I FIRED AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT EACH TIME A LONGER SHOT AND MORE OBSCURED BY THE INTERVENING BUSH AND NO TELL TALE THUD CAME BACK TO CHEER ME ON
4660-25054-0018 FORGETTING THE LAST NIGHT'S EXPERIENCE FORGETTING EVERYTHING EXCEPT HOW WE HAD TWICE CHASED AND TWICE LOST THEM SEEING ONLY ANOTHER AND THE GRANDEST PRIZE SLIPPING AWAY
4660-25054-0019 ONCE MORE THE KOODOO CAME IN SIGHT JUST A CHANCE AT FOUR HUNDRED YARDS AS HE REACHED AN OPEN SPACE ON RISING GROUND
4660-25054-0020 ONCE MORE I KNELT GRIPPING HARD AND HOLDING MY BREATH TO SNATCH A MOMENT'S STEADINESS AND FIRED BUT I MISSED AGAIN
4660-25054-0021 DASHING OUT FROM THE SCRUB REACHED HIS HEELS THE OLD MARTINI CARBINE HAD ONE BAD FAULT EVEN I COULD NOT DENY THAT YEARS OF ROUGH AND CARELESS TREATMENT IN ALL SORTS OF WEATHER FOR IT WAS ONLY A DISCARDED OLD MOUNTED POLICE WEAPON HAD TOLD ON IT
4660-25054-0022 AND BOTH IN BARREL AND BREECH IT WAS WELL PITTED WITH RUST SCARS ONE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT IT WAS ALWAYS JAMMING AND UNLESS THE CARTRIDGES WERE KEPT WELL GREASED THE EMPTY SHELLS WOULD STICK AND THE EJECTOR FAIL TO WORK
4660-25054-0023 AND THIS WAS ALMOST SURE TO HAPPEN WHEN THE CARBINE BECAME HOT FROM QUICK FIRING IT JAMMED NOW AND FEARING TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE CHASE I DARED NOT STOP A SECOND BUT RAN ON STRUGGLING FROM TIME TO TIME TO WRENCH THE BREACH OPEN REACHING THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD DISAPPEARED
4660-25054-0024 I SAW WITH INTENSE RELIEF AND EXCITEMENT JOCK AND THE KOODOO HAVING IT OUT LESS THAN A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY THE KOODOO'S LEG WAS BROKEN RIGHT UP IN THE HAM AND IT WAS A TERRIBLE HANDICAP FOR AN ANIMAL SO BIG AND HEAVY BUT HIS NIMBLENESS AND QUICKNESS WERE ASTONISHING
4660-25054-0025 USING THE SOUND HIND LEG AS A PIVOT HE SWUNG ROUND ALWAYS FACING HIS ENEMY
4660-25054-0026 BUZZING FLY TORMENTS ONE ON A HOT DAY AND INDEED TO THE KOODOO JUST THEN HE WAS THE FLY AND NOTHING MORE HE COULD ONLY ANNOY HIS BIG ENEMY AND WAS PLAYING WITH HIS LIFE TO DO IT SOMETIMES HE TRIED TO GET ROUND SOMETIMES PRETENDED TO CHARGE STRAIGHT IN
4660-25054-0027 STOPPING HIMSELF WITH ALL FOUR FEET SPREAD JUST OUT OF REACH THEN LIKE A RED STREAK HE WOULD FLY THROUGH THE AIR WITH A SNAP FOR THE KOODOO'S NOSE IT WAS A FIGHT FOR LIFE AND A GRAND SIGHT FOR THE KOODOO IN SPITE OF HIS WOUND EASILY HELD HIS OWN
4660-25054-0028 NO DOUBT HE HAD FOUGHT OUT MANY A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE TO WIN AND HOLD HIS PLACE AS LORD OF THE HERD AND KNEW EVERY TRICK OF ATTACK AND DEFENCE
4660-25054-0029 MAYBE TOO HE WAS BLAZING WITH ANGER AND CONTEMPT FOR THIS PERSISTENT LITTLE GAD FLY THAT WORRIED HIM SO AND KEPT OUT OF REACH SOMETIMES HE SNORTED AND FEINTED TO CHARGE AT OTHER TIMES BACKED SLOWLY GIVING WAY TO DRAW THE ENEMY ON
4660-25054-0030 LOOKING ABOUT WITH BIG ANGRY BUT UNFRIGHTENED EYES FOR THE HERD HIS HERD THAT HAD DESERTED HIM OR WITH A SLIGHT TOSS OF HIS HEAD HE WOULD WALK LIMPINGLY FORWARD FORCING THE IGNORED JOCK BEFORE HIM
4660-25054-0031 HE WOULD SPRING FORWARD AND STRIKE WITH THE SHARP CLOVEN FORE FOOT ZIP ZIP ZIP AT JOCK AS HE LANDED ANY ONE OF THE VICIOUS FLASHING STABS WOULD HAVE PINNED HIM TO THE EARTH AND FINISHED HIM BUT JOCK WAS NEVER THERE
4660-25054-0032 KEEPING WHAT COVER THERE WAS I CAME UP SLOWLY BEHIND THEM STRUGGLING AND USING ALL THE FORCE I DARED SHORT OF SMASHING THE LEVER TO GET THE EMPTY CARTRIDGE OUT AT LAST ONE OF THE TURNS IN THE FIGHT BROUGHT ME IN VIEW AND THE KOODOO DASHED OFF AGAIN
4660-25054-0033 FOR A LITTLE WAY THE PACE SEEMED AS GREAT AS EVER BUT IT SOON DIED AWAY THE DRIVING POWER WAS GONE THE STRAIN AND WEIGHT ON THE ONE SOUND LEG AND THE TRIPPING OF THE BROKEN ONE WERE TELLING AND FROM THAT ON I WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE IT ALL
4660-25054-0034 IN THE FIRST RUSH THE KOODOO SEEMED TO DASH RIGHT OVER JOCK THE SWIRL OF DUST AND LEAVES AND THE BULK OF THE KOODOO HIDING HIM THEN I SAW HIM CLOSE ABREAST LOOKING UP AT IT AND MAKING FURIOUS JUMPS FOR ITS NOSE ALTERNATELY FROM ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER
4660-25054-0035 AS THEY RACED ALONG TOGETHER THE KOODOO HOLDING ITS NOSE HIGH AND WELL FORWARD AS THEY DO WHEN ON THE MOVE WITH THE HORNS THROWN BACK ALMOST HORIZONTALLY WAS OUT OF HIS REACH AND GALLOPED HEAVILY ON COMPLETELY IGNORING HIS ATTACKS
4660-25054-0036 THERE IS A SUGGESTION OF GRACE AND POISE IN THE MOVEMENT OF THE KOODOO BULL'S HEAD AS HE GALLOPS THROUGH THE BUSH WHICH IS ONE OF HIS DISTINCTIONS ABOVE THE OTHER ANTELOPES
4660-25054-0037 THE SAME SUPPLE BALANCING MOVEMENT THAT ONE NOTES IN THE NATIVE GIRLS BEARING THEIR CALABASHES OF WATER UPON THEIR HEADS IS SEEN IN THE NECK OF THE KOODOO AND FOR THE SAME REASON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY ARE SOFTENED INTO MERE UNDULATIONS
4660-25054-0038 INDEED ALMOST AS THOUGH IT WERE BEARING THE BODY BELOW AT THE FOURTH OR FIFTH ATTEMPT BY JOCK A SPURT FROM THE KOODOO BROUGHT HIM CANNONING AGAINST ITS SHOULDER AND HE WAS SENT ROLLING UNNOTICED YARDS AWAY HE SCRAMBLED INSTANTLY TO HIS FEET
4660-25054-0039 BUT FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN BEHIND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THIS FACT THAT INSPIRED THE NEXT ATTEMPT OR PERHAPS HE REALISED THAT ATTACK IN FRONT WAS USELESS FOR THIS TIME HE WENT DETERMINEDLY FOR THE BROKEN LEG IT SWUNG ABOUT IN WILD ECCENTRIC CURVES
4660-25054-0040 BUT AT THE THIRD OR FOURTH ATTEMPT HE GOT IT AND HUNG ON AND WITH ALL FOURS SPREAD HE DRAGGED ALONG THE GROUND THE FIRST STARTLED SPRING OF THE KOODOO JERKED HIM INTO THE AIR BUT THERE WAS NO LET GO NOW
4660-25054-0041 SOMETIMES SWINGING IN THE AIR AND SOMETIMES SLIDING ON HIS BACK HE PULLED FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO THROW THE BIG ANIMAL INEFFECTUAL AND EVEN HOPELESS AS IT LOOKED AT FIRST JOCK'S ATTACKS SOON BEGAN TO TELL
4660-25054-0042 THE KOODOO MADE WILD EFFORTS TO GET AT HIM BUT WITH EVERY TURN HE TURNED TOO AND DID IT SO VIGOROUSLY THAT THE STAGGERING ANIMAL SWAYED OVER AND HAD TO PLUNGE VIOLENTLY TO RECOVER ITS BALANCE
4660-25054-0043 SO THEY TURNED THIS WAY AND THAT UNTIL A WILDER PLUNGE SWUNG JOCK OFF HIS FEET THROWING THE BROKEN LEG ACROSS THE OTHER ONE THEN WITH FEET FIRMLY PLANTED JOCK TUGGED AGAIN
4660-25054-0044 AND THE KOODOO TRYING TO REGAIN ITS FOOTING WAS TRIPPED BY THE CROSSED LEGS AND CAME DOWN WITH A CRASH AS IT FELL JOCK WAS ROUND AND FASTENED ON THE NOSE BUT IT WAS NO DUIKER IMPALA OR RIETBUCK THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS TIME
4660-25054-0045 THE KOODOO GAVE A SNORT OF INDIGNATION AND SHOOK ITS HEAD AS A TERRIER SHAKES A RAT SO IT SHOOK JOCK WHIPPING THE GROUND WITH HIS SWINGING BODY AND WITH ANOTHER INDIGNANT SNORT AND TOSS OF THE HEAD FLUNG HIM OFF SENDING HIM SKIDDING ALONG THE GROUND ON HIS BACK
4660-25054-0046 THE KOODOO HAD FALLEN ON THE WOUNDED LEG AND FAILED TO RISE WITH THE FIRST EFFORT JOCK WHILE STILL SLITHERING ALONG THE GROUND ON HIS BACK WAS TEARING AT THE AIR WITH HIS FEET IN HIS MAD HASTE TO GET BACK TO THE ATTACK AND AS HE SCRAMBLED UP
4660-25054-0047 HE WAS TOO MAD TO BE WARY
4660-25054-0048 ONE BLACK POINT SEEMED TO PIERCE HIM THROUGH AND THROUGH SHOWING A FOOT OUT THE OTHER SIDE AND A JERKY TWIST OF THE GREAT HEAD SENT HIM TWIRLING LIKE A TIP CAT EIGHT OR TEN FEET UP IN THE AIR
4660-25054-0049 BUT UNTIL HE DROPPED WITH A THUD AND TEARING AND SCRAMBLING TO HIS FEET HE RACED IN AGAIN I FELT CERTAIN HE HAD BEEN GORED THROUGH THE KOODOO WAS UP AGAIN THEN I HAD RUSHED IN WITH RIFLE CLUBBED WITH THE WILD IDEA OF STUNNING IT BEFORE IT COULD RISE
4660-25054-0050 IT WAS A RUNNING FIGHT FROM THAT ON THE INSTANT THE KOODOO TURNED TO GO JOCK WAS ON TO THE LEG AGAIN AND NOTHING COULD SHAKE HIS HOLD I HAD TO KEEP AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE FOR THE BULL WAS STILL GOOD FOR A FURIOUS CHARGE EVEN WITH JOCK HANGING ON
4660-25054-0051 AND EYED ME IN THE MOST UNPROMISING FASHION WHENEVER I ATTEMPTED TO HEAD IT OFF OR EVEN TO COME CLOSE UP THE BIG EYES WERE BLOOD SHOT THEN BUT THERE WAS NO LOOK OF FEAR IN THEM THEY BLAZED WITH BAFFLED RAGE
4660-25054-0052 IMPOSSIBLE AS IT SEEMED TO SHAKE JOCK OFF OR TO GET AWAY FROM US AND IN SPITE OF THE BROKEN LEG AND LOSS OF BLOOD THE FURIOUS ATTEMPTS TO BEAT US OFF DID NOT SLACKEN IT WAS A DESPERATE RUNNING FIGHT AND RIGHT BRAVELY HE FOUGHT IT TO THE END
4660-25054-0053 AND RUNNING AHEAD OF THE KOODOO I MADE FOR THESE HOPING TO FIND A STICK STRAIGHT ENOUGH FOR A RAMROD TO FORCE THE EMPTY CARTRIDGE OUT
4660-25054-0054 BUT THE BROKEN LEG SWAYED OVER ONE OF THE BRANCHES AND JOCK WITH FEET PLANTED AGAINST THE TREE HUNG ON AND THE KOODOO TURNING FURIOUSLY ON HIM STUMBLED FLOUNDERED TRIPPED AND CAME DOWN WITH A CRASH AMONGST THE CRACKLING WOOD
4660-25054-0055 ONCE MORE LIKE A FLASH JOCK WAS OVER THE FALLEN BODY AND HAD FASTENED ON THE NOSE BUT ONLY TO BE SHAKEN WORSE THAN BEFORE THE KOODOO LITERALLY FLOGGED THE GROUND WITH HIM AND FOR AN INSTANT I SHUT MY EYES IT SEEMED AS IF THE PLUCKY DOG WOULD BE BEATEN INTO PULP
4660-25054-0056 THE BULL TRIED TO CHOP HIM WITH ITS FORE FEET BUT COULD NOT RAISE ITSELF ENOUGH AND AT EACH PAUSE JOCK WITH HIS WATCHFUL LITTLE EYES EVER ON THE ALERT DODGED HIS BODY ROUND TO AVOID THE CHOPPING FEET WITHOUT LETTING GO HIS HOLD
4660-25054-0057 THEN WITH A SNORT OF FURY THE KOODOO HALF RISING GAVE ITS HEAD A WILD UPWARD SWEEP AND SHOOK AS A SPRINGING ROD FLINGS A FISH THE KOODOO FLUNG JOCK OVER ITS HEAD AND ON TO A LOW FLAT TOPPED THORN TREE BEHIND
4660-25054-0058 THE DOG SOMERSAULTED SLOWLY AS HE CIRCLED IN THE AIR DROPPED ON HIS BACK IN THE THORNS SOME TWELVE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND CAME TUMBLING DOWN THROUGH THE BRANCHES SURELY THE TREE SAVED HIM FOR IT SEEMED AS IF SUCH A THROW MUST BREAK HIS BACK
4660-25054-0059 AS IT WAS HE DROPPED WITH A SICKENING THUMP YET EVEN AS HE FELL I SAW AGAIN THE SCRAMBLING TEARING MOVEMENT AS IF HE WAS TRYING TO RACE BACK TO THE FIGHT EVEN BEFORE HE REACHED GROUND
4660-25054-0060 I TRIED STICK AFTER STICK FOR A RAMROD BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS AT LAST IN DESPERATION AT SEEING JOCK ONCE MORE HANGING TO THE KOODOO'S NOSE
4660-25054-0061 I HOOKED THE LEVER ON TO A BRANCH AND SETTING MY FOOT AGAINST THE TREE WRENCHED UNTIL THE EMPTY CARTRIDGE FLEW OUT AND I WENT STAGGERING BACKWARDS IN THE LAST STRUGGLE WHILE I WAS BUSY WITH THE RIFLE THE KOODOO HAD MOVED AND IT WAS THEN LYING AGAINST ONE OF THE FALLEN TRUNKS
4660-25054-0062 THE FIRST SWING TO GET RID OF JOCK HAD LITERALLY SLOGGED HIM AGAINST THE TREE THE SECOND SWING SWEPT HIM UNDER IT WHERE A BEND IN THE TRUNK RAISED IT ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND
4660-25054-0063 AND GAINING HIS FOOTHOLD THERE JOCK STOOD FAST THERE THERE WITH HIS FEET PLANTED FIRMLY AND HIS SHOULDER HUMPED AGAINST THE DEAD TREE HE STOOD THIS TUG OF WAR THE KOODOO WITH ITS HEAD TWISTED BACK AS CAUGHT AT THE END OF THE SWING COULD PUT NO WEIGHT TO THE PULL
4660-25054-0064 YET THE WRENCHES IT GAVE TO FREE ITSELF DREW THE NOSE AND UPPER LIP OUT LIKE TOUGH RUBBER AND SEEMED TO STRETCH JOCK'S NECK VISIBLY I HAD TO COME ROUND WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THEM TO AVOID RISK OF HITTING JOCK
4660-25054-0065 AND IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE FOR BONE AND MUSCLE TO STAND THE TWO OR THREE TERRIBLE WRENCHES THAT I SAW THE SHOT WAS THE END AND AS THE SPLENDID HEAD DROPPED SLOWLY OVER JOCK LET GO HIS HOLD
