5487-4873-0000 THE CRYSTAL COFFIN NOW LET NO ONE SAY THAT A POOR TAILOR CAN'T GET ON IN THE WORLD AND INDEED EVEN ATTAIN TO VERY HIGH HONOUR NOTHING IS REQUIRED BUT TO SET THE RIGHT WAY TO WORK BUT OF COURSE THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING IS TO SUCCEED
5487-4873-0001 A VERY BRIGHT ACTIVE YOUNG TAILOR ONCE SET OFF ON HIS TRAVELS WHICH LED HIM INTO A WOOD AND AS HE DID NOT KNOW THE WAY HE SOON LOST HIMSELF NIGHT CAME ON AND THERE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO SEEK OUT THE BEST RESTING PLACE HE COULD FIND
5487-4873-0002 HE COULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF QUITE COMFORTABLE WITH A BED OF SOFT MOSS BUT THE FEAR OF WILD BEASTS DISTURBED HIS MIND AND AT LAST HE DETERMINED TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN A TREE HE SOUGHT OUT A TALL OAK TREE CLIMBED UP TO THE TOP
5487-4873-0003 AND FELT DEVOUTLY THANKFUL THAT HIS BIG SMOOTHING IRON WAS IN HIS POCKET FOR THE WIND IN THE TREE TOPS WAS SO HIGH THAT HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN BLOWN AWAY ALTOGETHER AFTER PASSING SOME HOURS OF THE NIGHT NOT WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE FEAR AND TREMBLING
5487-4873-0004 HE NOTICED A LIGHT SHINING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND HOPING IT MIGHT PROCEED FROM SOME HOUSE WHERE HE COULD FIND A BETTER SHELTER THAN IN THE TOP OF THE TREE HE CAUTIOUSLY DESCENDED AND WENT TOWARDS THE LIGHT IT LED HIM TO A LITTLE HUT ALL WOVEN TOGETHER OF REEDS AND RUSHES
5487-4873-0005 HE KNOCKED BRAVELY AT THE DOOR WHICH OPENED AND BY THE LIGHT WHICH SHONE FROM WITHIN HE SAW AN OLD GRAY HAIRED MAN DRESSED IN A COAT MADE OF BRIGHT COLOURED PATCHES WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE OLD MAN ROUGHLY
5487-4873-0006 I AM A POOR TAILOR REPLIED THE YOUTH I HAVE BEEN BENIGHTED IN THE FOREST AND I ENTREAT YOU TO LET ME TAKE SHELTER IN YOUR HUT TILL MORNING GO YOUR WAY SAID THE OLD MAN IN A SULKY TONE I'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH TRAMPS YOU MUST JUST GO ELSEWHERE
5487-4873-0007 WITH THESE WORDS HE TRIED TO SLIP BACK INTO HIS HOUSE BUT THE TAILOR LAID HOLD OF HIS COAT TAILS AND BEGGED SO HARD TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY THAT THE OLD FELLOW WHO WAS BY NO MEANS AS CROSS AS HE APPEARED WAS AT LENGTH TOUCHED BY HIS ENTREATIES LET HIM COME IN
5487-4873-0008 AND AFTER GIVING HIM SOME FOOD SHOWED HIM QUITE A NICE BED IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM THE WEARY TAILOR REQUIRED NO ROCKING TO REST BUT SLEPT SOUND TILL EARLY MORNING WHEN HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBERS BY A TREMENDOUS NOISE
5487-4873-0009 LOUD SCREAMS AND SHOUTS PIERCED THE THIN WALLS OF THE LITTLE HUT THE TAILOR WITH NEW BORN COURAGE SPRANG UP THREW ON HIS CLOTHES WITH ALL SPEED AND HURRIED OUT
5487-4873-0010 THERE HE SAW A HUGE BLACK BULL ENGAGED IN A TERRIBLE FIGHT WITH A FINE LARGE STAG THEY RUSHED AT EACH OTHER WITH SUCH FURY THAT THE GROUND SEEMED TO TREMBLE UNDER THEM AND THE WHOLE AIR TO BE FILLED WITH THEIR CRIES
5487-4873-0011 FOR SOME TIME IT APPEARED QUITE UNCERTAIN WHICH WOULD BE THE VICTOR BUT AT LENGTH THE STAG DROVE HIS ANTLERS WITH SUCH FORCE INTO HIS OPPONENT'S BODY THAT THE BULL FELL TO THE GROUND WITH A TERRIFIC ROAR AND A FEW MORE STROKES FINISHED HIM
5487-4873-0012 THE TAILOR WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THE FIGHT WITH AMAZEMENT WAS STILL STANDING MOTIONLESS WHEN THE STAG BOUNDED UP TO HIM AND BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO ESCAPE FORKED HIM UP WITH ITS GREAT ANTLERS AND SET OFF AT FULL GALLOP OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES HILL AND DALE
5487-4873-0013 THROUGH WOOD AND WATER THE TAILOR COULD DO NOTHING BUT HOLD ON TIGHT WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE STAG'S HORNS AND RESIGN HIMSELF TO HIS FATE HE FELT AS IF HE WERE FLYING ALONG AT LENGTH THE STAG PAUSED BEFORE A STEEP ROCK AND GENTLY LET THE TAILOR DOWN TO THE GROUND
5487-4873-0014 FEELING MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE HE PAUSED FOR A WHILE TO COLLECT HIS SCATTERED SENSES BUT WHEN HE SEEMED SOMEWHAT RESTORED THE STAG STRUCK SUCH A BLOW ON A DOOR IN THE ROCK THAT IT FLEW OPEN FLAMES OF FIRE RUSHED FORTH
5487-4873-0015 AND SUCH CLOUDS OF STEAM FOLLOWED THAT THE STAG HAD TO AVERT ITS EYES THE TAILOR COULD NOT THINK WHAT TO DO OR WHICH WAY TO TURN TO GET AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL WILDERNESS AND TO FIND HIS WAY BACK AMONGST HUMAN BEINGS ONCE MORE AS HE STOOD HESITATING
5487-4873-0016 A VOICE FROM THE ROCK CRIED TO HIM STEP IN WITHOUT FEAR NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU HE STILL LINGERED BUT SOME MYSTERIOUS POWER SEEMED TO IMPEL HIM
5487-4873-0017 AND PASSING THROUGH THE DOOR HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A SPACIOUS HALL WHOSE CEILING WALLS AND FLOOR WERE COVERED WITH POLISHED TILES CARVED ALL OVER WITH UNKNOWN FIGURES HE GAZED ABOUT FULL OF WONDER
5487-4873-0018 TREAD ON THE STONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL AND GOOD LUCK WILL ATTEND YOU BY THIS TIME HE HAD GROWN SO COURAGEOUS THAT HE DID NOT HESITATE TO OBEY THE ORDER AND HARDLY HAD HE STEPPED ON THE STONE THAN IT BEGAN TO SINK GENTLY WITH HIM INTO THE DEPTHS BELOW
5487-4873-0019 ON REACHING FIRM GROUND HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A HALL OF MUCH THE SAME SIZE AS THE UPPER ONE BUT WITH MUCH MORE IN IT TO WONDER AT AND ADMIRE
5487-4873-0020 ON THE FLOOR STOOD TWO LARGE CRYSTAL BOXES OPPOSITE EACH OTHER AND THESE ATTRACTED HIS CURIOSITY AT ONCE
5487-4873-0021 STEPPING UP TO ONE OF THEM HE SAW WITHIN IT WHAT LOOKED LIKE A MODEL IN MINIATURE OF A FINE CASTLE SURROUNDED BY FARMS BARNS STABLES AND A NUMBER OF OTHER BUILDINGS EVERYTHING WAS QUITE TINY
5487-4873-0022 HE WOULD HAVE CONTINUED GAZING MUCH LONGER AT THIS REMARKABLE CURIOSITY HAD NOT THE VOICE DESIRED HIM TO TURN ROUND AND LOOK AT THE CRYSTAL COFFIN WHICH STOOD OPPOSITE WHAT WAS HIS AMAZEMENT AT SEEING A GIRL OF SURPASSING LOVELINESS LYING IN IT
5487-4873-0023 SHE LAY AS THOUGH SLEEPING AND HER LONG FAIR HAIR SEEMED TO WRAP HER ROUND LIKE SOME COSTLY MANTLE HER EYES WERE CLOSED BUT THE BRIGHT COLOUR IN HER FACE AND THE MOVEMENT OF A RIBBON WHICH ROSE AND FELL WITH HER BREATH LEFT NO DOUBT AS TO HER BEING ALIVE
5487-4873-0024 AS THE TAILOR STOOD GAZING AT HER WITH A BEATING HEART THE MAIDEN SUDDENLY OPENED HER EYES AND STARTED WITH DELIGHTED SURPRISE GREAT HEAVENS SHE CRIED MY DELIVERANCE APPROACHES QUICK QUICK HELP ME OUT OF MY PRISON
5487-4873-0025 ONLY PUSH BACK THE BOLT OF THIS COFFIN AND I AM FREE THE TAILOR PROMPTLY OBEYED WHEN SHE QUICKLY PUSHED BACK THE CRYSTAL LID STEPPED OUT OF THE COFFIN AND HURRIED TO A CORNER OF THE HALL WHEN SHE PROCEEDED TO WRAP HERSELF IN A LARGE CLOAK
5487-4873-0026 THEN SHE SAT DOWN ON A STONE DESIRED THE YOUNG MAN TO COME NEAR AND GIVING HIM AN AFFECTIONATE KISS SHE SAID MY LONG HOPED FOR DELIVERER KIND HEAVEN HAS LED YOU TO ME AND HAS AT LENGTH PUT AN END TO ALL MY SUFFERINGS
5487-4873-0027 YOU ARE MY DESTINED HUSBAND AND BELOVED BY ME AND ENDOWED WITH EVERY KIND OF RICHES AND POWER YOU SHALL SPEND THE REMAINDER OF YOUR LIFE IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS NOW SIT DOWN AND HEAR MY STORY I AM THE DAUGHTER OF A WEALTHY NOBLEMAN
5487-4873-0028 MY PARENTS DIED WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG AND THEY LEFT ME TO THE CARE OF MY ELDEST BROTHER BY WHOM I WAS CAREFULLY EDUCATED WE LOVED EACH OTHER SO TENDERLY AND OUR TASTES AND INTERESTS WERE SO MUCH ALIKE THAT WE DETERMINED NEVER TO MARRY BUT TO SPEND OUR ENTIRE LIVES TOGETHER
5487-4873-0029 THERE WAS NO LACK OF SOCIETY AT OUR HOME FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS PAID US FREQUENT VISITS AND WE KEPT OPEN HOUSE FOR ALL THUS IT HAPPENED THAT ONE EVENING A STRANGER RODE UP TO THE CASTLE AND ASKED FOR HOSPITALITY AS HE COULD NOT REACH THE NEAREST TOWN THAT NIGHT
5487-4873-0030 WE GRANTED HIS REQUEST WITH READY COURTESY AND DURING SUPPER HE ENTERTAINED US WITH MOST AGREEABLE CONVERSATION MINGLED WITH AMUSING ANECDOTES MY BROTHER TOOK SUCH A FANCY TO HIM THAT HE PRESSED HIM TO SPEND A COUPLE OF DAYS WITH US
5487-4873-0031 WHICH AFTER A LITTLE HESITATION THE STRANGER CONSENTED TO DO WE ROSE LATE FROM TABLE AND WHILST MY BROTHER WAS SHOWING OUR GUEST TO HIS ROOM I HURRIED TO MINE FOR I WAS VERY TIRED AND LONGED TO GET TO BED
5487-4873-0032 I HAD HARDLY DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP WHEN I WAS ROUSED BY THE SOUND OF SOME SOFT AND CHARMING MUSIC WONDERING WHENCE IT COULD COME I WAS ABOUT TO CALL TO MY MAID WHO SLEPT IN THE ROOM NEXT MINE
5487-4873-0033 WHEN TO MY SURPRISE I FELT AS IF SOME HEAVY WEIGHT ON MY CHEST HAD TAKEN ALL POWER FROM ME AND I LAY THERE UNABLE TO UTTER THE SLIGHTEST SOUND MEANTIME BY THE LIGHT OF THE NIGHT LAMP I SAW THE STRANGER ENTER MY ROOM THOUGH THE DOUBLE DOORS HAD BEEN SECURELY LOCKED
5487-4873-0034 HE DREW NEAR AND TOLD ME THAT THROUGH THE POWER OF HIS MAGIC ARTS HE HAD CAUSED THE SOFT MUSIC TO WAKEN ME AND HAD MADE HIS WAY THROUGH BOLTS AND BARS TO OFFER ME HIS HAND AND HEART MY REPUGNANCE TO HIS MAGIC WAS SO GREAT THAT I WOULD NOT CONDESCEND TO GIVE ANY ANSWER
5487-4873-0035 HE WAITED MOTIONLESS FOR SOME TIME HOPING NO DOUBT FOR A FAVOURABLE REPLY BUT AS I CONTINUED SILENT HE ANGRILY DECLARED THAT HE WOULD FIND MEANS TO PUNISH MY PRIDE AND THEREWITH HE LEFT THE ROOM IN A RAGE
5487-4873-0036 I SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE GREATEST AGITATION AND ONLY FELL INTO A DOZE TOWARDS MORNING AS SOON AS I AWOKE I JUMPED UP AND HURRIED TO TELL MY BROTHER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED BUT HE HAD LEFT HIS ROOM AND HIS SERVANT TOLD ME THAT HE HAD GONE OUT AT DAYBREAK TO HUNT WITH THE STRANGER
5487-4873-0037 MY MIND MISGAVE ME I DRESSED IN ALL HASTE HAD MY PALFREY SADDLED AND RODE OF AT FULL GALLOP TOWARDS THE FOREST ATTENDED BY ONE SERVANT ONLY
5487-4873-0038 I PUSHED ON WITHOUT PAUSING AND ERE LONG I SAW THE STRANGER COMING TOWARDS ME AND LEADING A FINE STAG I ASKED HIM WHERE HE HAD LEFT MY BROTHER AND HOW HE HAD GOT THE STAG WHOSE GREAT EYES WERE OVERFLOWING WITH TEARS INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HE BEGAN TO LAUGH
5487-4873-0039 AND I FLEW INTO SUCH A RAGE THAT I DREW A PISTOL AND FIRED AT HIM BUT THE BULLET REBOUNDED FROM HIS BREAST AND STRUCK MY HORSE IN THE FOREHEAD I FELL TO THE GROUND AND THE STRANGER MUTTERED SOME WORDS WHICH ROBBED ME OF MY SENSES WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF
5487-4873-0040 I WAS LYING IN A CRYSTAL COFFIN IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN VAULT THE MAGICIAN APPEARED AGAIN AND TOLD ME THAT HE HAD TRANSFORMED MY BROTHER INTO A STAG HAD REDUCED OUR CASTLE AND ALL ITS DEFENCES TO MINIATURE AND LOCKED THEM UP IN A GLASS BOX
5487-4873-0041 AND AFTER TURNING ALL OUR HOUSEHOLD INTO DIFFERENT VAPOURS HAD BANISHED THEM INTO GLASS PHIALS IF I WOULD ONLY YIELD TO HIS WISHES HE COULD EASILY OPEN THESE VESSELS AND ALL WOULD THEN RESUME THEIR FORMER SHAPES
5487-4873-0042 I WOULD NOT SAY A WORD MORE THAN I HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY AND HE VANISHED LEAVING ME IN MY PRISON WHERE A DEEP SLEEP SOON FELL ON ME AMONGST THE MANY DREAMS WHICH FLOATED THROUGH MY BRAIN WAS A CHEERING ONE OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS TO COME AND RELEASE ME
5487-4873-0043 AND TO DAY WHEN I OPENED MY EYES I RECOGNISED YOU AND SAW THAT MY DREAM WAS FULFILLED NOW HELP ME TO CARRY OUT THE REST OF MY VISION THE FIRST THING IS TO PLACE THE GLASS BOX WHICH CONTAINS MY CASTLE ON THIS LARGE STONE
5487-4873-0044 AS SOON AS THIS WAS DONE THE STONE GENTLY ROSE THROUGH THE AIR AND TRANSPORTED THEM INTO THE UPPER HALL WHENCE THEY EASILY CARRIED THE BOX INTO THE OUTER AIR THE LADY THEN REMOVED THE LID
5487-4873-0045 AND IT WAS MARVELLOUS TO WATCH THE CASTLE HOUSES AND FARMYARDS BEGIN TO GROW AND SPREAD THEMSELVES TILL THEY HAD REGAINED THEIR PROPER SIZE THEN THE YOUNG COUPLE RETURNED BY MEANS OF THE MOVABLE STONE AND BROUGHT UP ALL THE GLASS VESSELS FILLED WITH SMOKE
5487-4873-0046 NO SOONER WERE THEY UNCORKED THAN THE BLUE VAPOURS POURED OUT AND BECAME TRANSFORMED TO LIVING PEOPLE IN WHOM THE LADY JOYFULLY RECOGNISED HER MANY SERVANTS AND ATTENDANTS
