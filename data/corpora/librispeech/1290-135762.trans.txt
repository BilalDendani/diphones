1290-135762-0000 THE MARKET PLACE THE GRASS PLOT BEFORE THE JAIL IN PRISON LANE ON A CERTAIN SUMMER MORNING NOT LESS THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO WAS OCCUPIED BY A PRETTY LARGE NUMBER OF THE INHABITANTS OF BOSTON ALL WITH THEIR EYES INTENTLY FASTENED ON THE IRON CLAMPED OAKEN DOOR
1290-135762-0001 THE GRIM RIGIDITY THAT PETRIFIED THE BEARDED PHYSIOGNOMIES OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE
1290-135762-0002 ON WHOM THE SENTENCE OF A LEGAL TRIBUNAL HAD BUT CONFIRMED THE VERDICT OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT BUT IN THAT EARLY SEVERITY OF THE PURITAN CHARACTER AN INFERENCE OF THIS KIND COULD NOT SO INDUBITABLY BE DRAWN
1290-135762-0003 IT MIGHT BE THAT A SLUGGISH BOND SERVANT OR AN UNDUTIFUL CHILD WHOM HIS PARENTS HAD GIVEN OVER TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITY WAS TO BE CORRECTED AT THE WHIPPING POST IT MIGHT BE THAT AN ANTINOMIAN A QUAKER OR OTHER HETERODOX RELIGIONIST WAS TO BE SCOURGED OUT OF THE TOWN
1290-135762-0004 OR AN IDLE OR VAGRANT INDIAN WHOM THE WHITE MAN'S FIREWATER
1290-135762-0005 WAS TO DIE UPON THE GALLOWS IN EITHER CASE THERE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME SOLEMNITY OF DEMEANOUR ON THE PART OF THE SPECTATORS AS BEFITTED A PEOPLE AMONG WHOM RELIGION AND LAW WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL
1290-135762-0006 AND IN WHOSE CHARACTER BOTH WERE SO THOROUGHLY INTERFUSED THAT THE MILDEST AND SEVEREST ACTS OF PUBLIC DISCIPLINE WERE ALIKE MADE VENERABLE AND AWFUL MEAGRE INDEED AND COLD WAS THE SYMPATHY THAT A TRANSGRESSOR MIGHT LOOK FOR FROM SUCH BYSTANDERS AT THE SCAFFOLD
1290-135762-0007 ON THE OTHER HAND A PENALTY WHICH IN OUR DAYS WOULD INFER A DEGREE OF MOCKING INFAMY AND RIDICULE MIGHT THEN BE INVESTED WITH ALMOST AS STERN A DIGNITY AS THE PUNISHMENT OF DEATH ITSELF IT WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE NOTED ON THE SUMMER MORNING
1290-135762-0008 WHEN OUR STORY BEGINS ITS COURSE THAT THE WOMEN OF WHOM THERE WERE SEVERAL IN THE CROWD APPEARED TO TAKE A PECULIAR INTEREST IN WHATEVER PENAL INFLICTION MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO ENSUE
1290-135762-0009 FROM STEPPING FORTH INTO THE PUBLIC WAYS AND WEDGING THEIR
1290-135762-0010 IF OCCASION WERE INTO THE THRONG NEAREST TO THE SCAFFOLD AT AN EXECUTION
1290-135762-0011 AND BREEDING THAN IN THEIR FAIR DESCENDANTS SEPARATED FROM THEM BY A SERIES OF SIX OR SEVEN GENERATIONS FOR THROUGHOUT THAT CHAIN OF ANCESTRY EVERY SUCCESSIVE MOTHER HAD TRANSMITTED TO HER CHILD A FAINTER BLOOM A MORE DELICATE AND BRIEFER BEAUTY
1290-135762-0012 AND A SLIGHTER PHYSICAL FRAME IF NOT CHARACTER OF LESS FORCE AND SOLIDITY THAN HER OWN THE WOMEN WHO WERE NOW STANDING ABOUT THE PRISON DOOR STOOD WITHIN LESS THAN HALF A CENTURY OF THE PERIOD WHEN THE MAN LIKE ELIZABETH
1290-135762-0013 NOT ALTOGETHER UNSUITABLE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SEX THEY WERE HER COUNTRYWOMEN AND THE BEEF AND ALE OF THEIR NATIVE LAND WITH A MORAL DIET NOT A WHIT MORE REFINED ENTERED LARGELY INTO THEIR COMPOSITION THE BRIGHT MORNING SUN THEREFORE
1290-135762-0014 SHONE ON BROAD SHOULDERS AND WELL DEVELOPED BUSTS AND ON ROUND AND RUDDY CHEEKS THAT HAD RIPENED IN THE FAR OFF ISLAND AND HAD HARDLY YET GROWN PALER OR THINNER IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF NEW ENGLAND THERE WAS MOREOVER
1290-135762-0015 A BOLDNESS AND ROTUNDITY OF SPEECH AMONG THESE MATRONS AS MOST OF THEM SEEMED TO BE THAT WOULD STARTLE US AT THE PRESENT DAY
1290-135762-0016 OR ITS VOLUME OF TONE GOODWIVES SAID A HARD FEATURED DAME OF FIFTY
1290-135762-0017 GREATLY FOR THE PUBLIC BEHOOF IF WE WOMEN BEING OF MATURE AGE AND CHURCH MEMBERS IN GOOD REPUTE SHOULD HAVE THE HANDLING OF SUCH MALEFACTRESSES AS THIS HESTER PRYNNE WHAT THINK YE GOSSIPS IF THE HUSSY STOOD UP FOR JUDGMENT BEFORE US FIVE
1290-135762-0018 WOULD SHE COME OFF WITH SUCH A SENTENCE AS THE WORSHIPFUL MAGISTRATES HAVE AWARDED MARRY I TROW NOT PEOPLE SAY SAID ANOTHER THAT THE REVEREND MASTER DIMMESDALE HER GODLY PASTOR TAKES IT VERY GRIEVOUSLY TO HEART THAT SUCH A SCANDAL SHOULD HAVE COME UPON HIS CONGREGATION
1290-135762-0019 AT THE VERY LEAST THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT THE BRAND OF A HOT IRON ON HESTER PRYNNE'S FOREHEAD MADAME HESTER WOULD HAVE WINCED AT THAT I WARRANT ME BUT SHE THE NAUGHTY BAGGAGE LITTLE WILL SHE CARE WHAT THEY PUT UPON THE BODICE OF HER GOWN WHY LOOK YOU
1290-135762-0020 SHE MAY COVER IT WITH A BROOCH OR SUCH LIKE HEATHENISH ADORNMENT AND SO WALK THE STREETS AS BRAVE AS EVER AH BUT INTERPOSED MORE SOFTLY A YOUNG WIFE HOLDING A CHILD BY THE HAND
1290-135762-0021 THE UGLIEST AS WELL AS THE MOST PITILESS
1290-135762-0022 SELF CONSTITUTED JUDGES THIS WOMAN HAS BROUGHT SHAME UPON US ALL AND OUGHT TO DIE IS THERE NOT LAW FOR IT TRULY THERE IS BOTH IN THE SCRIPTURE AND THE STATUTE BOOK THEN LET THE MAGISTRATES WHO HAVE MADE IT OF NO EFFECT
1290-135762-0023 THANK THEMSELVES IF THEIR OWN WIVES AND DAUGHTERS GO ASTRAY
1290-135762-0024 IS THERE NO VIRTUE IN WOMAN SAVE WHAT SPRINGS FROM A WHOLESOME FEAR OF THE GALLOWS THAT IS THE HARDEST WORD YET HUSH NOW GOSSIPS FOR THE LOCK IS TURNING IN THE PRISON DOOR AND HERE COMES MISTRESS PRYNNE HERSELF
1290-135762-0025 THE DOOR OF THE JAIL BEING FLUNG OPEN FROM WITHIN THERE APPEARED IN THE FIRST PLACE LIKE A BLACK SHADOW EMERGING INTO SUNSHINE THE GRIM AND GRISTLY PRESENCE OF THE TOWN BEADLE WITH A SWORD BY HIS SIDE AND HIS STAFF OF OFFICE IN HIS HAND THIS PERSONAGE
1290-135762-0026 WHICH IT WAS HIS BUSINESS TO ADMINISTER IN ITS FINAL AND CLOSEST APPLICATION TO THE OFFENDER STRETCHING FORTH THE OFFICIAL STAFF IN HIS LEFT HAND HE LAID HIS RIGHT UPON THE SHOULDER OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHOM HE THUS DREW FORWARD UNTIL ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE PRISON DOOR SHE REPELLED HIM
1290-135762-0027 BY AN ACTION MARKED WITH NATURAL DIGNITY AND FORCE OF CHARACTER AND STEPPED INTO THE OPEN AIR AS IF BY HER OWN FREE WILL SHE BORE IN HER ARMS A CHILD A BABY OF SOME THREE MONTHS OLD WHO WINKED AND TURNED ASIDE ITS LITTLE FACE FROM THE TOO VIVID LIGHT OF DAY
1290-135762-0028 BECAUSE ITS EXISTENCE HERETOFORE HAD BROUGHT IT
1290-135762-0029 OR OTHER DARKSOME APARTMENT OF THE PRISON
1290-135762-0030 THE MOTHER OF THIS CHILD STOOD FULLY REVEALED BEFORE THE CROWD IT SEEMED TO BE HER FIRST IMPULSE TO CLASP THE INFANT CLOSELY TO HER BOSOM
1290-135762-0031 AS THAT SHE MIGHT THEREBY CONCEAL A CERTAIN TOKEN WHICH WAS WROUGHT OR FASTENED INTO HER DRESS
1290-135762-0032 WOULD BUT POORLY SERVE TO HIDE ANOTHER SHE TOOK THE BABY ON HER ARM AND WITH A BURNING BLUSH AND YET A HAUGHTY SMILE AND A GLANCE THAT WOULD NOT BE ABASHED LOOKED AROUND AT HER TOWNSPEOPLE AND NEIGHBOURS ON THE BREAST OF HER GOWN
1290-135762-0033 IN FINE RED CLOTH SURROUNDED WITH AN ELABORATE EMBROIDERY AND FANTASTIC FLOURISHES OF GOLD THREAD APPEARED THE LETTER A
1290-135762-0034 AND GORGEOUS LUXURIANCE OF FANCY THAT IT HAD ALL THE EFFECT OF A LAST AND FITTING DECORATION TO THE APPAREL WHICH SHE WORE
1290-135762-0035 BUT GREATLY BEYOND WHAT WAS ALLOWED BY THE SUMPTUARY
1290-135762-0036 WITH A FIGURE OF PERFECT ELEGANCE ON A LARGE SCALE SHE HAD DARK AND ABUNDANT HAIR SO GLOSSY THAT IT THREW OFF THE SUNSHINE WITH A GLEAM AND A FACE WHICH BESIDES BEING BEAUTIFUL FROM REGULARITY OF FEATURE AND RICHNESS OF COMPLEXION
1290-135762-0037 HAD THE IMPRESSIVENESS BELONGING TO A MARKED BROW AND DEEP BLACK EYES SHE WAS LADYLIKE TOO AFTER THE MANNER OF THE FEMININE GENTILITY OF THOSE DAYS CHARACTERISED BY A CERTAIN STATE AND DIGNITY
1290-135762-0038 INDESCRIBABLE GRACE WHICH IS NOW RECOGNISED AS ITS INDICATION AND NEVER HAD HESTER PRYNNE APPEARED MORE LADYLIKE IN THE ANTIQUE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM THAN AS SHE ISSUED FROM THE PRISON
1290-135762-0039 WERE ASTONISHED AND EVEN STARTLED TO PERCEIVE HOW HER BEAUTY SHONE OUT AND MADE A HALO OF THE MISFORTUNE AND IGNOMINY IN WHICH SHE WAS ENVELOPED IT MAY BE TRUE THAT TO A SENSITIVE OBSERVER THERE WAS SOME THING EXQUISITELY PAINFUL IN IT HER ATTIRE
1290-135762-0040 WHICH INDEED SHE HAD WROUGHT FOR THE OCCASION IN PRISON
1290-135762-0041 SEEMED TO EXPRESS THE ATTITUDE OF HER SPIRIT THE DESPERATE RECKLESSNESS OF HER MOOD BY ITS WILD AND PICTURESQUE PECULIARITY BUT THE POINT WHICH DREW ALL EYES AND AS IT WERE TRANSFIGURED THE WEARER
1290-135762-0042 ACQUAINTED WITH HESTER PRYNNE WERE NOW IMPRESSED
1290-135762-0043 WAS THAT SCARLET LETTER SO FANTASTICALLY EMBROIDERED AND ILLUMINATED UPON HER BOSOM IT HAD THE EFFECT OF A SPELL TAKING HER OUT OF THE ORDINARY RELATIONS WITH HUMANITY
1290-135762-0044 BY HERSELF SHE HATH GOOD SKILL AT HER NEEDLE THAT'S CERTAIN REMARKED ONE OF HER FEMALE SPECTATORS
1290-135762-0045 OUT OF WHAT THEY WORTHY GENTLEMEN MEANT FOR A PUNISHMENT IT WERE WELL MUTTERED THE MOST IRON VISAGED OF THE OLD DAMES IF WE STRIPPED MADAME HESTER'S RICH GOWN OFF HER DAINTY SHOULDERS
1290-135762-0046 AND AS FOR THE RED LETTER WHICH SHE HATH STITCHED SO CURIOUSLY I'LL BESTOW A RAG OF MINE OWN RHEUMATIC FLANNEL TO MAKE A FITTER ONE OH PEACE NEIGHBOURS PEACE WHISPERED THEIR YOUNGEST COMPANION DO NOT LET HER HEAR YOU
1290-135762-0047 NOW MADE A GESTURE WITH HIS STAFF MAKE WAY GOOD PEOPLE MAKE WAY IN THE KING'S NAME CRIED HE OPEN A PASSAGE AND I PROMISE YE
1290-135762-0048 FROM THIS TIME TILL AN HOUR PAST MERIDIAN A BLESSING ON THE RIGHTEOUS COLONY OF THE MASSACHUSETTS WHERE INIQUITY IS DRAGGED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE COME ALONG MADAME HESTER AND SHOW YOUR SCARLET LETTER IN THE MARKET PLACE
1290-135762-0049 A LANE WAS FORTHWITH OPENED THROUGH THE CROWD OF SPECTATORS PRECEDED BY THE BEADLE AND ATTENDED BY AN IRREGULAR PROCESSION OF STERN BROWED MEN AND UNKINDLY VISAGED WOMEN HESTER PRYNNE SET FORTH TOWARDS THE PLACE APPOINTED FOR HER PUNISHMENT
1290-135762-0050 A CROWD OF EAGER AND CURIOUS SCHOOLBOYS UNDERSTANDING LITTLE OF THE MATTER IN HAND EXCEPT THAT IT GAVE THEM A HALF HOLIDAY RAN BEFORE HER PROGRESS
1290-135762-0051 MEASURED BY THE PRISONER'S EXPERIENCE HOWEVER
1290-135762-0052 TO SEE HER AS IF HER HEART HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO THE STREET FOR THEM ALL TO SPURN AND TRAMPLE UPON IN OUR NATURE HOWEVER THERE IS A PROVISION ALIKE MARVELLOUS AND MERCIFUL THAT THE SUFFERER SHOULD NEVER KNOW THE INTENSITY
1290-135762-0053 OF WHAT HE ENDURES BY ITS PRESENT TORTURE BUT CHIEFLY BY THE PANG THAT RANKLES AFTER IT
1290-135762-0054 AND CAME TO A SORT OF SCAFFOLD AT THE WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE MARKET PLACE IT STOOD NEARLY BENEATH THE EAVES OF BOSTON'S EARLIEST CHURCH AND APPEARED TO BE A FIXTURE THERE IN FACT THIS SCAFFOLD CONSTITUTED A PORTION OF A PENAL MACHINE WHICH NOW
1290-135762-0055 FOR TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS PAST HAS BEEN MERELY HISTORICAL AND TRADITIONARY AMONG US BUT WAS HELD IN THE OLD TIME
1290-135762-0056 AS EVER WAS THE GUILLOTINE AMONG THE TERRORISTS OF FRANCE IT WAS IN SHORT THE PLATFORM OF THE PILLORY
1290-135762-0057 GRASP AND THUS HOLD IT UP TO THE PUBLIC GAZE THE VERY IDEAL OF IGNOMINY
1290-135762-0058 THERE CAN BE NO OUTRAGE METHINKS AGAINST OUR COMMON NATURE
1290-135762-0059 DELINQUENCIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL NO OUTRAGE MORE FLAGRANT THAN TO FORBID THE CULPRIT TO HIDE HIS FACE FOR SHAME AS IT WAS THE ESSENCE OF THIS PUNISHMENT TO DO IN HESTER PRYNNE'S INSTANCE HOWEVER AS NOT UNFREQUENTLY IN OTHER CASES HER SENTENCE BORE THAT
1290-135762-0060 SHE SHOULD STAND A CERTAIN TIME UPON THE PLATFORM BUT WITHOUT UNDERGOING THAT GRIPE ABOUT THE NECK AND CONFINEMENT OF THE HEAD THE PRONENESS TO WHICH WAS THE MOST DEVILISH CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS UGLY ENGINE
1290-135762-0061 AT ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF A MAN'S SHOULDERS ABOVE THE STREET
1290-135762-0062 AND WITH THE INFANT AT HER BOSOM AN OBJECT TO REMIND HIM OF THE IMAGE OF DIVINE MATERNITY WHICH SO MANY ILLUSTRIOUS PAINTERS HAVE VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER TO REPRESENT SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD REMIND HIM INDEED BUT ONLY BY CONTRAST
1290-135762-0063 OF THAT SACRED IMAGE OF SINLESS MOTHERHOOD WHOSE INFANT WAS TO REDEEM THE WORLD HERE THERE WAS THE TAINT OF DEEPEST SIN IN THE MOST SACRED QUALITY OF HUMAN LIFE WORKING SUCH EFFECT THAT THE WORLD WAS ONLY THE DARKER FOR THIS WOMAN'S BEAUTY
1290-135762-0064 AND THE MORE LOST FOR THE INFANT THAT SHE HAD BORNE THE SCENE WAS NOT WITHOUT A MIXTURE OF AWE SUCH AS MUST ALWAYS INVEST THE SPECTACLE OF GUILT AND SHAME IN A FELLOW CREATURE
1290-135762-0065 BEFORE SOCIETY SHALL HAVE GROWN CORRUPT ENOUGH TO SMILE INSTEAD OF SHUDDERING AT IT THE WITNESSES OF HESTER PRYNNE'S DISGRACE HAD NOT YET PASSED BEYOND THEIR SIMPLICITY THEY WERE STERN ENOUGH TO LOOK UPON HER DEATH HAD THAT BEEN THE SENTENCE WITHOUT A MURMUR AT ITS SEVERITY
1290-135762-0066 BUT HAD NONE OF THE HEARTLESSNESS OF ANOTHER SOCIAL STATE WHICH WOULD FIND ONLY A THEME FOR JEST IN AN EXHIBITION LIKE THE PRESENT EVEN HAD THERE BEEN A DISPOSITION TO TURN THE MATTER INTO RIDICULE IT MUST HAVE BEEN REPRESSED AND OVERPOWERED BY THE SOLEMN PRESENCE OF MEN NO LESS DIGNIFIED THAN THE GOVERNOR
1290-135762-0067 AND SEVERAL OF HIS COUNSELLORS A JUDGE A GENERAL AND THE MINISTERS OF THE TOWN ALL OF WHOM SAT OR STOOD IN A BALCONY OF THE MEETING HOUSE LOOKING DOWN UPON THE PLATFORM
1290-135762-0068 COULD CONSTITUTE A PART OF THE SPECTACLE WITHOUT RISKING THE MAJESTY OR REVERENCE OF RANK AND OFFICE IT WAS SAFELY TO BE INFERRED THAT THE INFLICTION OF A LEGAL SENTENCE WOULD HAVE AN EARNEST AND EFFECTUAL MEANING ACCORDINGLY THE CROWD WAS SOMBRE AND GRAVE
1290-135762-0069 THE UNHAPPY CULPRIT SUSTAINED HERSELF AS BEST A WOMAN MIGHT UNDER THE HEAVY WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND UNRELENTING EYES ALL FASTENED UPON HER
1290-135762-0070 OF AN IMPULSIVE AND PASSIONATE NATURE SHE HAD FORTIFIED HERSELF TO ENCOUNTER THE STINGS AND VENOMOUS STABS OF PUBLIC CONTUMELY
1290-135762-0071 BUT THERE WAS A QUALITY SO MUCH MORE TERRIBLE IN THE SOLEMN MOOD OF THE POPULAR MIND THAT SHE LONGED RATHER TO BEHOLD ALL THOSE RIGID COUNTENANCES CONTORTED WITH SCORNFUL MERRIMENT AND HERSELF THE OBJECT
1290-135762-0072 HAD A ROAR OF LAUGHTER BURST FROM THE MULTITUDE EACH MAN EACH WOMAN EACH LITTLE SHRILL VOICED CHILD CONTRIBUTING THEIR INDIVIDUAL PARTS
1290-135762-0073 BUT UNDER THE LEADEN INFLICTION WHICH IT WAS HER DOOM TO ENDURE SHE FELT AT MOMENTS AS IF SHE MUST NEEDS SHRIEK OUT WITH THE FULL POWER OF HER LUNGS AND CAST HERSELF FROM THE SCAFFOLD DOWN UPON THE GROUND OR ELSE GO MAD AT ONCE
1290-135762-0074 YET THERE WERE INTERVALS WHEN THE WHOLE SCENE IN WHICH SHE WAS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OBJECT SEEMED TO VANISH FROM HER EYES OR AT LEAST GLIMMERED INDISTINCTLY BEFORE THEM LIKE A MASS OF IMPERFECTLY SHAPED AND SPECTRAL IMAGES
1290-135762-0075 WAS PRETERNATURALLY ACTIVE AND KEPT BRINGING UP OTHER SCENES THAN THIS ROUGHLY HEWN STREET OF A LITTLE
1290-135762-0076 OTHER FACES THAN WERE LOWERING UPON HER FROM BENEATH THE BRIMS OF THOSE STEEPLE CROWNED HATS
1290-135762-0077 PASSAGES OF INFANCY AND SCHOOL DAYS SPORTS CHILDISH QUARRELS AND THE LITTLE DOMESTIC TRAITS OF HER MAIDEN YEARS CAME SWARMING BACK UPON HER INTERMINGLED WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF WHATEVER WAS GRAVEST IN HER SUBSEQUENT LIFE
1290-135762-0078 ONE PICTURE PRECISELY AS VIVID AS ANOTHER AS IF ALL WERE OF SIMILAR IMPORTANCE OR ALL ALIKE A PLAY
1290-135762-0079 PHANTASMAGORIC FORMS FROM THE CRUEL WEIGHT AND HARDNESS OF THE REALITY BE THAT AS IT MIGHT THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY
1290-135762-0080 SINCE HER HAPPY INFANCY STANDING ON THAT MISERABLE EMINENCE SHE SAW AGAIN HER NATIVE VILLAGE IN OLD ENGLAND AND HER PATERNAL HOME A DECAYED HOUSE OF GREY STONE WITH A POVERTY STRICKEN ASPECT BUT RETAINING A HALF OBLITERATED SHIELD OF ARMS OVER THE PORTAL
1290-135762-0081 IN TOKEN OF ANTIQUE GENTILITY
1290-135762-0082 REVEREND WHITE BEARD THAT FLOWED OVER THE OLD FASHIONED ELIZABETHAN RUFF HER MOTHER'S TOO WITH THE LOOK OF HEEDFUL AND ANXIOUS LOVE
1290-135762-0083 AND WHICH EVEN SINCE HER DEATH HAD SO OFTEN LAID THE IMPEDIMENT OF A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE IN HER DAUGHTER'S PATHWAY SHE SAW HER OWN FACE GLOWING WITH GIRLISH BEAUTY AND ILLUMINATING ALL THE INTERIOR OF THE DUSKY MIRROR IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN
1290-135762-0084 OF A MAN WELL STRICKEN IN YEARS A PALE THIN SCHOLAR LIKE VISAGE WITH EYES DIM AND BLEARED BY THE LAMP LIGHT THAT HAD SERVED THEM TO PORE OVER MANY PONDEROUS BOOKS
1290-135762-0085 YET THOSE SAME BLEARED OPTICS HAD A STRANGE PENETRATING POWER
1290-135762-0086 THIS FIGURE OF THE STUDY AND THE CLOISTER
1290-135762-0087 WAS SLIGHTLY DEFORMED WITH THE LEFT SHOULDER A TRIFLE HIGHER THAN THE RIGHT NEXT ROSE BEFORE HER
1290-135762-0088 THE INTRICATE AND NARROW THOROUGHFARES THE TALL GREY HOUSES
1290-135762-0089 ANCIENT IN DATE AND QUAINT IN ARCHITECTURE OF A CONTINENTAL CITY WHERE NEW LIFE HAD AWAITED HER STILL IN
1290-135762-0090 A NEW LIFE BUT FEEDING ITSELF ON TIME WORN MATERIALS LIKE A TUFT OF GREEN MOSS ON A CRUMBLING WALL LASTLY IN LIEU OF THESE SHIFTING SCENES CAME BACK THE RUDE MARKET PLACE OF THE PURITAN SETTLEMENT WITH ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE ASSEMBLED
1290-135762-0091 AND LEVELLING THEIR STERN REGARDS AT HESTER PRYNNE YES AT HERSELF WHO STOOD ON THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY AN INFANT ON HER ARM AND THE LETTER A IN SCARLET FANTASTICALLY EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD THREAD UPON HER BOSOM
1290-135762-0092 COULD IT BE TRUE SHE CLUTCHED THE CHILD SO FIERCELY TO HER BREAST THAT IT SENT
1290-135762-0093 SHE TURNED HER EYES DOWNWARD AT THE SCARLET LETTER AND EVEN TOUCHED IT WITH HER FINGER TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE INFANT AND THE SHAME WERE REAL YES THESE WERE HER REALITIES
