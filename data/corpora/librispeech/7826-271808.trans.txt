7826-271808-0012 THE RIVER WAS ENTIRELY DESERTED BY BOATS FOR IT WAS A WARM DAY AND EVEN THE FISHER FOLK DID NOT CARE TO BE OUT ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE WERE GREAT WALLS OF ROCK RISING UP FROM THE RIVER BUT AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WERE BUSHY TREES THAT LINED THE FURTHER EDGE OF THE WATER
7826-271808-0013 JUST LIKE WHISKERS SAID TOT SO THEY ARE FROM HERE AGREED DOT BUT IF WE WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WE WOULD FIND THEM TO BE BIG TREES IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE SO FAR AWAY THAT THEY LOOK LIKE THE RIVER'S WHISKERS
7826-271808-0014 THEY WALKED FARTHER ALONG THE SHORE UNTIL THEY WERE PAST THE GROUNDS OF ROSELAWN AND THEN TURNING A LITTLE BEND IN THE RIVER THEY CAME TO SOME LOW BUSHES GROWING DOWN BY THE WATER OH TOT CRIED THE GIRL
7826-271808-0015 LET US GO BACK AND FETCH THE BASKET TOT FOLLOWED OBEDIENTLY FOR HE RECOGNIZED DOT AS THE LEADER NOT ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS OLDER BUT BECAUSE SHE POSSESSED THE WONDERFUL BASKET OF GOOD THINGS
7826-271808-0016 THEY WALKED BACK TO THE BIG STONE WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THE BASKET AND AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF LABOR MANAGED TO CARRY IT TO THE GROVE OF LOW TREES PUSHING THE BRANCHES ASIDE THEY CREPT THROUGH THE BUSHES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE EDGE OF THE RIVER AND THEN DOT UTTERED

7826-271808-0019 WHILE THE REST OF IT LAY QUIETLY UPON THE WATER BUT THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES THREW A COOL SHADE OVER ALL AND IT SEEMED TO DOT AND TOT THE MOST PLEASANT PLACE TO EAT THEIR LUNCHEON THEY CARRIED THE BASKET TO THE BROAD SEAT FARTHEST OUT IN THE WATER
