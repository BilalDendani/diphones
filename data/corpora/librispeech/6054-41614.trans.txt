6054-41614-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN ELEANOR FINDS A WAY NOW THAT THANKSGIVING WAS PAST BASKETBALL BECAME THE TOPIC OF THE HOUR THE JUNIORS HAD ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE OF THE SENIOR CLASS
6054-41614-0001 AND HAD AGREED TO PLAY THEM ON SATURDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE GYMNASIUM ONLY TWO WEEKS REMAINED IN WHICH TO PRACTISE THEIR SORORITY ENTHUSIASM HAD SO COMPLETELY RUN AWAY WITH THEM THAT THEY HAD EVEN NEGLECTED BASKETBALL UNTIL NOW
6054-41614-0002 THEREFORE GRACE HARLOWE LOST NO TIME IN GETTING MISS THOMPSON'S PERMISSION TO USE THE GYMNASIUM AND PROMPTLY NOTIFIED HER TEAM AND THE SUBS TO MEET THERE IN GYMNASIUM SUITS PREPARED TO PLAY THAT AFTERNOON
6054-41614-0003 THE INSTANT THE LAST BELL SOUNDED ON LESSONS TEN GIRLS MADE FOR THEIR LOCKERS AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THE FIRST TEAM AND THE SUBS WERE MOVING TOWARD THE GYMNASIUM DEEP IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE COMING GAME AND THEIR CHANCES FOR SUCCESS OVER THEIR OPPONENTS
6054-41614-0004 A BRIEF MEETING WAS HELD AND THE GIRLS WERE ASSIGNED TO THEIR POSITIONS GRACE HAD FULLY INTENDED THAT MIRIAM SHOULD PLAY CENTER BUT WHEN SHE PROPOSED IT MIRIAM FLATLY REFUSED TO DO SO AND ASKED FOR HER OLD POSITION OF RIGHT FORWARD
6054-41614-0005 YOU ARE OUR CAPTAIN SHE DECLARED TO GRACE AND THE BEST CENTER I EVER SAW ON A GIRLS TEAM
6054-41614-0006 DON'T YOU AGREE WITH ME GIRLS NORA WAS DETAILED AS LEFT FORWARD WHILE MARIAN BARBER AND EVA ALLEN PLAYED RIGHT AND LEFT GUARDS THE SUBSTITUTES WERE ALSO ASSIGNED THEIR POSITIONS AND PRACTICE BEGAN
6054-41614-0007 AND WORKED WITH THE OLD TIME DASH AND SPIRIT THAT HAD WON THEM THE CHAMPIONSHIP THE PREVIOUS YEAR NOW THAT THEY WERE IN HARMONY WITH EACH OTHER THEY PLAYED WITH REMARKABLE UNITY AND AFTER AN HOUR'S PRACTICE GRACE DECIDED THAT THEY WERE IN A FAIR WAY TO WHIP THE SENIORS OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH
6054-41614-0008 I NEVER SAW YOU GIRLS WORK BETTER SHE EXCLAIMED IT WILL BE A SORRY DAY FOR THE SENIORS WHEN WE LINE UP ON THE TWELFTH THERE'LL BE A GREAT GNASHING OF SENIOR TEETH AFTER THE GAME REMARKED NORA CONFIDENTLY DO YOU KNOW GIRLS
6054-41614-0009 SAID GRACE AS THEY LEFT THE GYMNASIUM THAT AFTERNOON
6054-41614-0010 I WANTED HER TO LIKE EVERY BIT OF OUR SCHOOL LIFE AND THOUGHT SHE'D SURELY BE INTERESTED IN BASKETBALL
6054-41614-0011 GRACE HARLOWE ARE YOU EVER GOING TO STOP MOURNING OVER ELEANOR CRIED MIRIAM IMPATIENTLY
6054-41614-0012 I KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I USED TO BE JUST AS RIDICULOUS AS SHE IS AND KNOWING WHAT YOU SUFFERED THROUGH ME I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE YOU UNHAPPY AGAIN OVER SOME ONE WHO IS TOO TRIVIAL TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY YOU'RE A DEAR MIRIAM EXCLAIMED NORA IMPULSIVELY
6054-41614-0013 ALTHOUGH FROM THE TIME SHE AND GRACE HAD SETTLED THEIR DIFFICULTIES AT THE CLOSE OF THE SOPHOMORE YEAR
6054-41614-0014 WHERE ARE ANNE AND JESSICA TO DAY ASKED EVA ALLEN ANNE AND JESSICA HAVE REFUSED POINT BLANK TO HONOR US WITH THEIR PRESENCE DURING PRACTICE ANNOUNCED NORA I ASKED JESSICA TO DAY
6054-41614-0015 FOR THEN THEY COULD WAX ENTHUSIASTIC AND MAKE A GREAT DEAL MORE NOISE IT IS THEIR AMBITION TO BECOME LOUD AND LOYAL FANS WHAT A WORTHY AMBITION SAID MARIAN BARBER WITH A GIGGLE THEY ARE SUCH NOISY CREATURES ALREADY
6054-41614-0016 REMEMBER WE PRACTISE TO MORROW AFTER SCHOOL CALLED GRACE AS SHE SEPARATED FROM HER TEAM AT HER STREET AS SHE WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THE QUIET STREET DEEP IN THOUGHT HER EAR CAUGHT THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING AUTOMOBILE AND SHE LOOKED UP JUST IN TIME TO SEE ELEANOR DRIVE BY IN HER MACHINE
6054-41614-0017 GRACE NODDED TO HER BUT HER SALUTATION MET WITH A CHILLY STARE HOW CHILDISH SHE IS THOUGHT GRACE I SUPPOSE SHE THINKS THAT HURTS ME
6054-41614-0018 ALTHOUGH I HAVE FAR GREATER CAUSE TO BE BUT BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE WEEK GRACE WAS DESTINED TO CROSS SWORDS WITH ELEANOR IN EARNEST AND THE TOLERATION SHE HAD FELT WAS SWALLOWED UP IN RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION DURING THE WINTER
6054-41614-0019 THEATRICAL COMPANIES SOMETIMES VISITED OAKDALE FOR A WEEK AT A TIME PRESENTING AT POPULAR PRICES OLD WORN OUT PLAYS AND CHEAP MELODRAMAS THESE COMPANIES GAVE DAILY MATINEES AS WELL AS EVENING PERFORMANCES AND THE MORE FRIVOLOUS ELEMENT OF HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS
6054-41614-0020 SKIPPED SCHOOL TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON IN THE THEATRE BY THE GIRLS THIS FORM OF TRUANCY WAS CONSIDERED A LARK
6054-41614-0021 THAT THE GIRLS WERE SLOW TO OFFEND IN THIS RESPECT ALL THIS ELEANOR HAD HEARD AMONG OTHER THINGS FROM EDNA WRIGHT BUT HAD PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO IT WHEN EDNA HAD TOLD HER DIRECTLY AFTER CUTTING GRACE HARLOWE SHE HAD TURNED HER RUNABOUT INTO MAIN STREET
6054-41614-0022 WHERE A BILLBOARD HAD CAUGHT HER EYE DISPLAYING IN GLARING RED AND BLUE LETTERING THE FACT THAT THE PEERLESS DRAMATIC COMPANY WOULD OPEN A WEEK'S ENGAGEMENT IN OAKDALE WITH DAILY MATINEES ELEANOR'S EYES SPARKLED SHE HALTED HER MACHINE
6054-41614-0023 SCANNING CURIOUSLY THE LIST OF PLAYS ON THE BILLBOARD THE NIHILIST'S DAUGHTER WAS SCHEDULED FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND ELEANOR DECIDED TO GO SHE WASN'T AFRAID OF MISS THOMPSON
