7946-116281-0000 AS ANY CARPENTER OR MASON MIGHT DO LOOKS AS THOUGH I AM GOING TO HOLD A RECEPTION THIS MORNING SAID OAKES
7946-116281-0001 AND NOW MARTIN ASKING FOR ANOTHER WHAT IS MARTIN DOING UP HERE ASKED MOORE WELL DON'T GET IMPATIENT HE HAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT ANYWAY JUST WAIT
7946-116281-0002 I THINK MOORE FELT AGGRAVATED AT OAKES'S APPARENT INDIFFERENCE OF COURSE IT WAS SIMULATED BUT HE SEEMED SO CALM AND OBLIVIOUS OF THE MASS OF HAPPENINGS
7946-116281-0003 THAT HAD PUT MOORE AND MYSELF IN A STATE OF EXTREME EXCITEMENT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE MARTIN AND MISTER ELLIOTT WERE WITH US OAKES RECEIVED ELLIOTT IN A MOST AGREEABLE MANNER
7946-116281-0004 ALSO HE WAS SURE IT MUST BE OF GREAT VALUE SINCE THE GENTLEMAN HAD TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO PLACE HIM IN POSSESSION OF IT AND THIS WAS SAID BEFORE ANY INFORMATION WAS GIVEN
7946-116281-0005 WE SAW THAT OUR FRIEND WAS A DIPLOMAT QUICKLY MISTER ELLIOTT GAVE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE NEGRO'S CONFESSION AND THE DETECTIVE SAID
7946-116281-0006 AS THE MATTER BELONGS TO HIS JURISDICTION LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THAT MOMENT
7946-116281-0007 GOOD SAID OAKES NOW MISTER ELLIOTT WILL YOU KINDLY RETIRE WITH DOCTOR MOORE WHILE STONE MARTIN AND I HEAR WHAT THE CHIEF HAS TO SAY WHEN HALLEN CAME UP HE SEEMED VERY CORDIAL BUT WORRIED
7946-116281-0008 AND MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE THE FACT THAT HE ANTICIPATED TROUBLE WITH THE UNRULY ELEMENT IN MONA BY SATURDAY NIGHT YOU SEE HE SAID WE ARE FEW HERE
7946-116281-0009 AND I HAVE BEEN KEPT BUSY WITH THE BREWING UNEASINESS IN TOWN AND CANNOT HANDLE THE MURDER AFFAIR SATISFACTORILY I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU TO HELP ME IF YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY AT LEISURE WE CANNOT GET ANY CLUES AT ALL
7946-116281-0010 IN THE HANDS OF A GOOD SHOT AS THE DISTANCE FROM WHICH IT WAS FIRED WOULD SEEM TO SHOW
7946-116281-0011 MY MEN HAVE REPORTED TO ME THE CURIOUS AFFAIR OF LAST NIGHT CONTINUED THE CHIEF I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR IT IN ANY EVENT IT MUST BE FOLLOWED UP THE PEOPLE MUST BE DIVERTED
7946-116281-0012 AND MORE MUST BE DONE AT ONCE THAN I CAN DO WILL YOU HELP ME YES SAID OAKES OF COURSE HELLO WHAT AILS YOUR HEAD SAID THE CHIEF AFTER THANKING HIM
7946-116281-0013 AND THEN OAKES TOLD HIM AS MUCH AS WAS NECESSARY OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY BEFORE I AM VERY GLAD YOUR CARPENTERS HAVE ARRIVED SAID THE CHIEF THEY MAY HELP HE SMILED AS DID OAKES THEY UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER THEY
7946-116281-0014 WERE IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS
7946-116281-0015 SAID OAKES AND HE CALLED IN MOORE AND ELLIOTT AND THE DISCUSSION BECAME GENERAL ELLIOTT WAS ADMITTED UNRESERVEDLY TO OUR COUNCILS ESPECIALLY AS OAKES KNEW THAT HE HELD THE KEYS TO THE CONVICTION OF THE ASSASSIN
7946-116281-0016 THE WITNESS OAKES IN HIS FLUENT STYLE ACQUAINTED THE CHIEF WITH THE FACT THAT THE NEGRO WAS ALREADY UNDER SURVEILLANCE AND THAT IN HIS OPINION HE SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO MONA FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION YES
7946-116281-0017 THEY MIGHT INFER HE WAS THE MURDERER AND VIOLENCE WOULD CERTAINLY BE DONE HIM AT PRESENT I HAVE ALL I CAN DO TO KEEP ORDER IN THE TOWN SAID HALLEN THEN HE GAVE A LUCID ACCOUNT OF THE WAVE OF SUSPICION AND OF THE EVIDENCES
7946-116281-0018 LIFE LONG FRIENDS ARE SUSPICIOUS OF ONE ANOTHER AND BUSINESS IS NEARLY AT A STANDSTILL
7946-116281-0019 AND THE OTHER RETALIATED WITH A BLOW AND AN OATH AND ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LOOK AT HIS OWN ARMS NOT HIS NEIGHBOR'S YES SAID OAKES
7946-116281-0020 ONE MUST ALWAYS TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE ACTIONS AND REASONINGS OF COMMUNITIES EMOTIONAL WAVES RUSH THROUGH THEM AS THROUGH INDIVIDUALS SOMETIMES
7946-116281-0021 LOOK AT HISTORY AND CONSIDER THE WAVES OF RELIGION EMOTIONAL IN CHARACTER THAT HAVE OCCURRED LOOK AT THE UNREASONABLENESS DEVELOPED IN OUR OWN COUNTRY FROM IGNORANCE AND FEAR
7946-116281-0022 AT THE STAKE OAKES SAID MOORE WITH A SMILE YOU SEEM TO MAKE MENTAL PROCESSES AND CONDITIONS
7946-116281-0023 CERTAINLY OAKES REPLIED IT IS MOST IMPORTANT DID WE NOT STUDY THE WORKINGS OF A CRIMINAL'S MIND FOR INSTANCE
7946-116281-0024 YOU SEE THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROBABLE CONDITION OF SUCH A ONE'S MIND IS OFTEN PARAMOUNT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH A CASE AS THIS IN OTHER WORDS WAS THE MOTIVE
7946-116281-0025 ONE THAT WOULD NATURALLY SWAY AN ORDINARY HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE CONDITIONS APPERTAINING TO THE CRIME THE SO CALLED SANE MOTIVE OR WAS IT IN ANY WAY DEPENDENT UPON PECULIARITIES
7946-116281-0026 OF THE CRIMINAL'S REASONING A MOTIVE BUILT UP OF SOMETHING UNREAL A DELUSION IN THE MIND OF ONE NOT IN HIS RIGHT SENSES
7946-116281-0027 I MYSELF HAD FREQUENTLY HAD CAUSE TO STUDY SUCH MENTAL PROCESSES IN THE PRACTICE OF MY PROFESSION BUT I WAS AMAZED AT THE KNOWLEDGE SHOWN BY OAKES
7946-116281-0028 AND STATED IN SUCH A BROAD UNTECHNICAL MANNER THE MAN WAS NO ORDINARY ONE TO BE SURE BUT I HAD SCARCELY EXPECTED HIM TO SHOW SUCH EDUCATION IN THESE MATTERS I NOW RECALLED WHAT MOORE
7946-116281-0029 HAD ONCE TOLD ME OF OAKES'S ALL ROUND ATTAINMENTS DOCTOR MOORE BROKE THE SILENCE
7946-116281-0030 OAKES DID NOT NOTICE THE REMARK BUT SAID
7946-116281-0031 YES SAID HALLEN AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS ONLY ONE QUINTUS OAKES IT SEEMS TO ME CONTINUED HALLEN
7946-116281-0032 AND I TRUST THAT YOU WILL FIND TIME TO CONSIDER THE MURDER ALSO GENTLEMEN SAID OAKES VERY SERIOUSLY
7946-116281-0033 I SHALL MAKE TIME HALLEN TO DO WHAT LITTLE I CAN AND THUS QUINTUS OAKES BECAME THE LEADER IN THE UNRAVELLING OF THE MARK MURDER MYSTERY AFTER A FEW REMARKS OF NO PARTICULAR CONSEQUENCE
7946-116281-0034 AND A MORE OR LESS GENERAL CONVERSATION HE RESUMED SUPPOSE CHIEF THAT WE NOW SMUGGLE THE NEGRO INTO MONA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BRING HIM HERE I BELIEVE THAT IF MISTER ELLIOTT GOES BACK WITH MARTIN
7946-116281-0035 IT MUST BE IMPRESSED UPON HIM THAT HE IS REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF A HERO APPEAL TO THE INNATE WEAKNESS OF THE RACE DESIRE FOR FLATTERY
7946-116281-0036 I BELIEVE WE CAN BRING HIM HERE EASILY SAID ELLIOTT FOR HE HAS CONFIDENCE IN ME IF HE REFUSES TO COME SAID HALLEN WE CAN GET HIM HERE IN PLENTY OF WAYS YES SAID OAKES
7946-116281-0037 INCOGNITO LEST THE PEOPLE BECOME TOO EXCITED
7946-116281-0038 MIGHT BE CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER INDIRECTLY OR DIRECTLY BUT AS YET WE HAD NOT HAD SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDYING THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE HOUSE OR THE LIFE OF ITS ATTACHES TO VENTURE AN OPINION
7946-116281-0039 HE LAID PARTICULAR STRESS UPON THE FACT THAT OPINIONS SHOULD NEVER BE FORMED ON POOR EVIDENCE SINCE A BIASED MIND WAS INCAPABLE OF APPRECIATING NEW DISCOVERIES OR NEW CLUES
7946-116281-0040 TO THEORIZE TOO MUCH WAS VERY EASY BUT SOMETIMES FATAL TO DETECTION OF CRIME HE PREFERRED TO WORK ALONG SEVERAL LINES OF INVESTIGATION BEFORE CONCENTRATION ON ANY ONE IDEA
7946-116281-0041 IS ONE OF VERY GRAVE IMPORT UNQUESTIONABLY FROM WHAT YOU SAW STONE AND FROM THE EVIDENCE OF US ALL THERE WERE TWO MEN NEAR THE PLACE YOU WERE GOING TO PASS
7946-116281-0042 THAT THE FIRST ONE WARNED YOU AND WAS IN A SENSE A FRIEND IS MYSTERIOUS ENOUGH IT NEEDS SOLUTION BUT THAT THE MAN WHO WARNED YOU SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY AND BEEN PURSUED BY THE OTHER IS PECULIAR TO SAY THE LEAST
7946-116281-0043 UNDOUBTEDLY AND HE RAN TO ESCAPE DETECTION HIMSELF THE OTHER
7946-116281-0044 WOULD UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE RUN AWAY WHEN HE SAW YOU WERE WARNED HE DID RUN BUT IT WAS AFTER THE MAN WHO WARNED YOU TO MY MIND THE EXPLANATION IS THIS CONTINUED THE DETECTIVE
7946-116281-0045 THE MAN AT THE BRIDGE IS FRIENDLY BUT CANNOT EXPOSE HIS IDENTITY OR RISK CAPTURE THE WOULD BE ASSASSIN
7946-116281-0046 HIM IN SELF PROTECTION I DON'T SEE WHY SAID MOORE HE COULD HAVE ESCAPED INSTEAD EXACTLY SAID OAKES HE COULD HAVE DONE SO BUT HE DID NOT WISH IT
7946-116281-0047 HE HAS NOT COMPLETED WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AROUND HERE HE WISHED TO COME BACK AND TO DO SO WITH SAFETY HE MUST RID HIMSELF OF THE ONE WHO KNEW OF HIS DOINGS
7946-116281-0048 I VENTURED OR BOTH SAID OAKES AT ALL EVENTS SAID HALLEN
7946-116281-0049 THE TENSION IS GREAT TOO GREAT FOR SAFETY
