5379-44344-0000 MISSUS EYRECO URT'S DISCOVERY THE LEAVES HAD FALLEN IN THE GROUNDS AT TEN ACRES LODGE AND STORMY WINDS TOLD DREARILY THAT WINTER HAD COME AN UNCHANGING DULLNESS PERVADED THE HOUSE
5379-44344-0001 ROMAYNE WAS CONSTANTLY ABSENT IN LONDON ATTENDING TO HIS NEW RELIGIOUS DUTIES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF FATHER BENWELL THE LITTER OF BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS IN THE STUDY WAS SEEN NO MORE HIDEOUSLY RIGID ORDER REIGNED IN THE UNUSED ROOM
5379-44344-0002 SOME OF ROMAYNE'S PAPERS HAD BEEN BURNED OTHERS WERE IMPRISONED IN DRAWERS AND CUPBOARDS THE HISTORY OF THE ORIGIN OF RELIGIONS HAD TAKEN ITS MELANCHOLY PLACE AMONG THE SUSPENDED LITERARY ENTERPRISES OF THE TIME
5379-44344-0003 MISSUS EYRECOURT AFTER A SUPERFICIALLY CORDIAL RECONCILIATION WITH HER SON IN LAW VISITED HER DAUGHTER EVERY NOW AND THEN AS AN ACT OF MATERNAL SACRIFICE SHE YAWNED PERPETUALLY SHE READ INNUMERABLE NOVELS
5379-44344-0004 SHE CORRESPONDED WITH HER FRIENDS IN THE LONG DULL EVENINGS THE ONCE LIVELY LADY SOMETIMES OPENLY REGRETTED THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN BORN A MAN WITH THE THREE MASCULINE RESOURCES OF SMOKING DRINKING AND SWEARING PLACED AT HER DISPOSAL
5379-44344-0005 IT WAS A DREARY EXISTENCE AND HAPPIER INFLUENCES SEEMED BUT LITTLE LIKELY TO CHANGE IT GRATEFUL AS SHE WAS TO HER MOTHER NO PERSUASION WOULD INDUCE STELLA TO LEAVE TEN ACRES AND AMUSE HERSELF IN LONDON
5379-44344-0006 MISSUS EYRECOURT SAID WITH MELANCHOLY AND METAPHORICAL TRUTH THERE IS NO ELASTICITY LEFT IN MY CHILD ON A DIM GRAY MORNING MOTHER AND DAUGHTER SAT BY THE FIRESIDE WITH ANOTHER LONG DAY BEFORE THEM

5379-44344-0017 A VERY REMARKABLE WORK STELLA IN THE PRESENT STATE OF LIGHT LITERATURE IN ENGLAND A NOVEL THAT ACTUALLY TELLS A STORY IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE I KNOW TRY THE BOOK IT HAS ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY MERIT IT ISN'T WRITTEN BY A WOMAN
5379-44344-0018 STELLA OBEDIENTLY RECEIVED THE FIRST VOLUME TURNED OVER THE LEAVES AND WEARILY DROPPED THE WONDERFUL NOVEL ON HER LAP I CAN'T ATTEND TO IT SHE SAID MY MIND IS TOO FULL OF MY OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT ROMAYNE SAID HER MOTHER

5379-44344-0020 DID I EVER TALK OF PRESENTIMENTS TO YOU IN THE BYGONE DAYS IF YOU HAD DONE ANYTHING OF THE SORT MY LOVE EXCUSE ME IF I SPEAK PLAINLY I SHOULD HAVE SAID STELLA YOUR LIVER IS OUT OF ORDER AND I SHOULD HAVE OPENED THE FAMILY MEDICINE CHEST I WILL ONLY SAY NOW
5379-44344-0021 SEND FOR THE CARRIAGE LET US GO TO A MORNING CONCERT DINE AT A RESTAURANT
5379-44344-0022 THIS CHARACTERISTIC PROPOSAL WAS ENTIRELY THROWN AWAY ON STELLA SHE WAS ABSORBED IN PURSUING HER OWN TRAIN OF THOUGHT I ALMOST WISH I HAD TOLD LEWIS SHE SAID TO HERSELF ABSENTLY TOLD HIM OF WHAT MY DEAR OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WITH WINTERFIELD
5379-44344-0023 MISSUS EYRECOURT'S FADED EYES OPENED WIDE IN ASTONISHMENT DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT SHE ASKED I DO INDEED ARE YOU ACTUALLY SIMPLE ENOUGH STELLA TO THINK THAT A MAN OF ROMAYNE'S TEMPER WOULD HAVE MADE YOU HIS WIFE IF YOU HAD TOLD HIM OF THE BRUSSELS MARRIAGE
5379-44344-0024 WHY NOT WHY NOT WOULD ROMAYNE WOULD ANY MAN BELIEVE THAT YOU REALLY DID PART FROM WINTERFIELD AT THE CHURCH DOOR CONSIDERING THAT YOU ARE A MARRIED WOMAN YOUR INNOCENCE MY SWEET CHILD IS A PERFECT PHENOMENON
5379-44344-0025 DON'T SPEAK TOO POSITIVELY MAMA LEWIS MAY FIND IT OUT YET
5379-44344-0026 YES HOW IS HE TO FIND IT OUT IF YOU PLEASE I AM AFRAID THROUGH FATHER BENWELL YES YES I KNOW YOU ONLY THINK HIM A FAWNING OLD HYPOCRITE YOU DON'T FEAR HIM AS I DO
5379-44344-0027 NOTHING WILL PERSUADE ME THAT ZEAL FOR HIS RELIGION IS THE MOTIVE UNDER WHICH THAT MAN ACTS IN DEVOTING HIMSELF TO ROMAYNE HE HAS SOME ABOMINABLE OBJECT IN VIEW AND HIS EYES TELL ME THAT I AM CONCERNED IN IT MISSUS EYRECOURT BURST OUT LAUGHING
5379-44344-0028 WHAT IS THERE TO LAUGH AT STELLA ASKED I DECLARE MY DEAR THERE IS SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY PROVOKING IN YOUR UTTER WANT OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD WHEN YOU ARE PUZZLED TO ACCOUNT FOR ANYTHING REMARKABLE IN A CLERGYMAN'S CONDUCT I DON'T CARE MY POOR CHILD TO WHAT DENOMINATION HE BELONGS
5379-44344-0029 YOU CAN'T BE WRONG IN ATTRIBUTING HIS MOTIVE TO MONEY IF ROMAYNE HAD TURNED BAPTIST OR METHODIST THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN IN CHARGE OF HIS SPIRITUAL WELFARE WOULD NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN AS YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN YOU LITTLE GOOSE THAT HIS CONVERT WAS A RICH MAN
5379-44344-0030 HIS MIND WOULD HAVE DWELT ON THE CHAPEL OR THE MISSION OR THE INFANT SCHOOL IN WANT OF FUNDS AND WITH NO MORE ABOMINABLE OBJECT IN VIEW THAN I HAVE AT THIS MOMENT IN POKING THE FIRE HE WOULD HAVE ENDED IN PRODUCING HIS MODEST SUBSCRIPTION LIST AND WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIMSELF
5379-44344-0031 PLEASE CONTRIBUTE IS THERE ANY OTHER PRESENTIMENT MY DEAR ON WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR MOTHER'S CANDID OPINION STELLA RESIGNEDLY TOOK UP THE BOOK AGAIN I DARESAY YOU ARE RIGHT SHE SAID LET US READ OUR NOVEL
5379-44344-0032 SHE WAS THINKING OF THAT OTHER PRESENTIMENT WHICH HAD FORMED THE SUBJECT OF HER MOTHER'S LAST SATIRICAL INQUIRY THE VAGUE FEAR THAT HAD SHAKEN HER WHEN SHE HAD ACCIDENTALLY TOUCHED THE FRENCH BOY ON HER VISIT TO CAMP'S HILL STILL FROM TIME TO TIME TROUBLED HER MEMORY
5379-44344-0033 EVEN THE EVENT OF HIS DEATH HAD FAILED TO DISSIPATE THE DELUSION WHICH ASSOCIATED HIM WITH SOME UNDEFINED EVIL INFLUENCE THAT MIGHT YET ASSERT ITSELF A SUPERSTITIOUS FOREWARNING OF THIS SORT WAS A WEAKNESS NEW TO HER IN HER EXPERIENCE OF HERSELF SHE WAS HEARTILY ASHAMED OF IT
5379-44344-0034 AND YET IT KEPT ITS HOLD ONCE MORE THE BOOK DROPPED ON HER LAP SHE LAID IT ASIDE AND WALKED WEARILY TO THE WINDOW TO LOOK AT THE WEATHER ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT MISSUS EYRECOURT'S MAID DISTURBED HER MISTRESS OVER THE SECOND VOLUME OF THE NOVEL BY ENTERING THE ROOM WITH A LETTER
5379-44344-0035 FOR ME STELLA ASKED LOOKING ROUND FROM THE WINDOW NO MA'AM FOR MISSUS EYRECOURT THE LETTER HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO THE HOUSE BY ONE OF LADY LORING'S SERVANTS IN DELIVERING IT HE HAD APPARENTLY GIVEN PRIVATE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE MAID
5379-44344-0036 SHE LAID HER FINGER SIGNIFICANTLY ON HER LIPS WHEN SHE GAVE THE LETTER TO HER MISTRESS IN THESE TERMS LADY LORING WROTE IF STELLA HAPPENS TO BE WITH YOU WHEN YOU RECEIVE MY NOTE DON'T SAY ANYTHING WHICH WILL LET HER KNOW THAT I AM YOUR CORRESPONDENT
5379-44344-0037 SHE HAS ALWAYS POOR DEAR HAD AN INVETERATE DISTRUST OF FATHER BENWELL AND BETWEEN OURSELVES I AM NOT SURE THAT SHE IS QUITE SO FOOLISH AS I ONCE THOUGHT THE FATHER HAS UNEXPECTEDLY LEFT US WITH A WELL FRAMED EXCUSE WHICH SATISFIED LORD LORING
5379-44344-0038 IT FAILS TO SATISFY ME NOT FROM ANY WONDERFUL EXERCISE OF PENETRATION ON MY PART BUT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOMETHING I HAVE JUST HEARD IN COURSE OF CONVERSATION WITH A CATHOLIC FRIEND FATHER BENWELL MY DEAR TURNS OUT TO BE A JESUIT
5379-44344-0039 AND WHAT IS MORE A PERSON OF SUCH HIGH AUTHORITY IN THE ORDER THAT HIS CONCEALMENT OF HIS RANK WHILE HE WAS WITH US MUST HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF NECESSITY
5379-44344-0040 HE MUST HAVE HAD SOME VERY SERIOUS MOTIVE FOR OCCUPYING A POSITION SO ENTIRELY BENEATH HIM AS HIS POSITION IN OUR HOUSE I HAVE NOT THE SHADOW OF A REASON FOR ASSOCIATING THIS STARTLING DISCOVERY WITH DEAR STELLA'S PAINFUL MISGIVINGS
5379-44344-0041 AND YET THERE IS SOMETHING IN MY MIND WHICH MAKES ME WANT TO HEAR WHAT STELLA'S MOTHER THINKS COME AND HAVE A TALK ABOUT IT AS SOON AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN MISSUS EYRECOURT PUT THE LETTER IN HER POCKET SMILING QUIETLY TO HERSELF
5379-44344-0042 APPLYING TO LADY LORING'S LETTER THE INFALLIBLE SYSTEM OF SOLUTION WHICH SHE HAD REVEALED TO HER DAUGHTER MISSUS EYRECOURT SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF THE PRIEST'S CONDUCT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION
5379-44344-0043 LORD LORING'S CHECK IN FATHER BENWELL'S POCKET REPRESENTING SUCH A LIBERAL SUBSCRIPTION THAT MY LORD WAS RELUCTANT TO MENTION IT TO MY LADY THERE WAS THE READING OF THE RIDDLE AS PLAIN AS THE SUN AT NOONDAY
5379-44344-0044 WOULD IT BE DESIRABLE TO ENLIGHTEN LADY LORING AS SHE HAD ALREADY ENLIGHTENED STELLA MISSUS EYRECOURT DECIDED IN THE NEGATIVE AS ROMAN CATHOLICS AND AS OLD FRIENDS OF ROMAYNE THE LORINGS NATURALLY REJOICED IN HIS CONVERSION
5379-44344-0045 BUT AS OLD FRIENDS ALSO OF ROMAYNE'S WIFE THEY WERE BOUND NOT TO EXPRESS THEIR SENTIMENTS TOO OPENLY FEELING THAT ANY DISCUSSION OF THE PRIEST'S MOTIVES WOULD PROBABLY LEAD TO THE DELICATE SUBJECT OF THE CONVERSION MISSUS EYRECOURT PRUDENTLY DETERMINED TO LET THE MATTER DROP
5379-44344-0046 AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS DECISION STELLA WAS LEFT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WARNING OF THE CATASTROPHE WHICH WAS NOW CLOSE AT HAND
5379-44344-0047 WELL MY DEAR IS IT CLEARING UP SHALL WE TAKE A DRIVE BEFORE LUNCHEON IF YOU LIKE MAMA
5379-44344-0048 THE LIGHT OF THE CLEARING SKY AT ONCE SOFT AND PENETRATING FELL FULL ON HER MISSUS EYRECOURT LOOKING AT HER AS USUAL SUDDENLY BECAME SERIOUS SHE STUDIED HER DAUGHTER'S FACE WITH AN EAGER AND ATTENTIVE SCRUTINY
5379-44344-0049 DO YOU SEE ANY EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE IN ME STELLA ASKED WITH A FAINT SMILE
5379-44344-0050 THE WORLDLY MOTHER'S EYES RESTED WITH A LINGERING TENDERNESS ON THE DAUGHTER'S FACE STELLA SHE SAID SOFTLY AND STOPPED AT A LOSS FOR WORDS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE AFTER A WHILE SHE BEGAN AGAIN
5379-44344-0051 YES I SEE A CHANGE IN YOU SHE WHISPERED AN INTERESTING CHANGE WHICH TELLS ME SOMETHING CAN YOU GUESS WHAT IT IS STELLA'S COLOR ROSE BRIGHTLY AND FADED AGAIN SHE LAID HER HEAD IN SILENCE ON HER MOTHER'S BOSOM
5379-44344-0052 WORLDLY FRIVOLOUS SELF INTERESTED MISSUS EYRECOURT'S NATURE WAS THE NATURE OF A WOMAN AND THE ONE GREAT TRIAL AND TRIUMPH OF A WOMAN'S LIFE APPEALING TO HER AS A TRIAL AND A TRIUMPH SOON TO COME TO HER OWN CHILD
5379-44344-0053 TOUCHED FIBERS UNDER THE HARDENED SURFACE OF HER HEART WHICH WERE STILL UNPROFANED MY POOR DARLING SHE SAID HAVE YOU TOLD THE GOOD NEWS TO YOUR HUSBAND NO WHY NOT HE DOESN'T CARE NOW FOR ANYTHING THAT I CAN TELL HIM NONSENSE STELLA
5379-44344-0054 YOU MAY WIN HIM BACK TO YOU BY A WORD AND DO YOU HESITATE TO SAY THE WORD I SHALL TELL HIM STELLA SUDDENLY DREW HERSELF AWAY FROM HER MOTHER'S CARESSING ARM
5379-44344-0055 PROMISE ON YOUR WORD OF HONOR PROMISE YOU WILL LEAVE IT TO ME WILL YOU TELL HIM YOURSELF IF I LEAVE IT TO YOU YES AT MY OWN TIME PROMISE HUSH HUSH DON'T EXCITE YOURSELF MY LOVE I PROMISE GIVE ME A KISS
5379-44344-0056 I DECLARE I AM AGITATED MYSELF SHE EXCLAIMED FALLING BACK INTO HER CUSTOMARY MANNER SUCH A SHOCK TO MY VANITY STELLA THE PROSPECT OF BECOMING A GRANDMOTHER I REALLY MUST RING FOR MATILDA AND TAKE A FEW DROPS OF RED LAVENDER
5379-44344-0057 BE ADVISED BY ME MY POOR DEAR AND WE WILL TURN THE PRIEST OUT OF THE HOUSE YET WHEN ROMAYNE COMES BACK FROM HIS RIDICULOUS RETREAT AFTER HIS FASTING AND FLAGELLATION AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT BESIDES
5379-44344-0058 THEN IS THE TIME TO TELL HIM WILL YOU THINK OF IT YES I WILL THINK OF IT AND ONE WORD MORE BEFORE MATILDA COMES IN
