2573-178449-0012 AND BIBBS STARED AT HER YES I'M SURE OF IT
2573-178449-0013 IT'S ONLY THAT HE HAS TO BE KIND IN HIS OWN WAY BECAUSE HE CAN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OTHER WAY AH YES SAID BIBBS IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN BY KIND SHE LOOKED AT HIM GRAVELY EARNEST CONCERN IN HER FRIENDLY EYES
2573-178449-0014 IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY HARD FOR YOU ISN'T IT
2573-178449-0015 THIS HAS BEEN JUST THE LAST FLICKER OF REVOLT NOBODY MINDS WORK IF HE LIKES THE KIND OF WORK
2573-178449-0016 MAN FOUND THE THING THAT HE COULD DO BEST BUT THE ONLY WORK I HAPPEN TO WANT TO DO IS USELESS SO I HAVE TO GIVE IT UP TO MORROW I'LL BE A DAY LABORER WHAT IS IT LIKE EXACTLY
2573-178449-0017 I GET UP AT SIX HE SAID I HAVE A LUNCH BASKET TO CARRY WITH ME WHICH IS ARISTOCRATIC AND NO ADVANTAGE THE OTHER WORKMEN HAVE TIN BUCKETS AND TIN BUCKETS ARE BETTER I LEAVE THE HOUSE AT SIX THIRTY AND I'M AT WORK IN MY OVERALLS AT SEVEN
2573-178449-0018 I HAVE AN HOUR OFF AT NOON AND WORK AGAIN FROM ONE TILL FIVE BUT THE WORK ITSELF IT WASN'T MUSCULARLY EXHAUSTING NOT AT ALL THEY COULDN'T GIVE ME A HEAVIER JOB BECAUSE I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
2573-178449-0019 BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I WANT TO KNOW WHEN I LEFT SAID BIBBS I WAS ON WHAT THEY CALL OVER THERE A CLIPPING MACHINE
2573-178449-0020 BUT WHAT IS IT SHE INSISTED BIBBS EXPLAINED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AND VERY EASY I FEED LONG STRIPS OF ZINC INTO A PAIR OF STEEL JAWS AND THE JAWS BITE THE ZINC INTO LITTLE CIRCLES ALL I HAVE TO DO
2573-178449-0021 IS TO SEE THAT THE STRIP GOES INTO THE JAWS AT A CERTAIN ANGLE AND YET I WAS A VERY BAD HAND AT IT HE HAD KEPT HIS VOICE CHEERFUL AS HE SPOKE BUT HE HAD GROWN A SHADE PALER AND THERE WAS A LATENT ANGUISH DEEP IN HIS EYES
2573-178449-0022 HE MAY HAVE KNOWN IT AND WISHED HER NOT TO SEE IT FOR HE TURNED AWAY
2573-178449-0023 YOU FEEDING A STRIP OF ZINC INTO A MACHINE NINE HOURS A DAY NO WONDER SHE BROKE OFF AND THEN AFTER A KEEN GLANCE AT HIS FACE SHE SAID I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN A BAD HAND AT IT HE LAUGHED RUEFULLY
2573-178449-0024 I THINK IT'S THE NOISE THOUGH I'M ASHAMED TO SAY IT YOU SEE IT'S A VERY POWERFUL MACHINE AND THERE'S A SORT OF RHYTHMICAL CRASHING A CRASH EVERY TIME THE JAWS BITE OFF A CIRCLE
2573-178449-0025 THE THING SHOULD MAKE ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT DISKS A MINUTE A LITTLE MORE THAN ONE A SECOND AND YOU'RE CLOSE TO IT OH THE WORKMAN HAS TO SIT IN ITS LAP HE SAID TURNING TO HER MORE GAILY THE OTHERS DON'T MIND
2573-178449-0026 YOU SEE IT'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME I HAVE AN IDIOTIC WAY OF FLINCHING FROM THE CONFOUNDED THING I FLINCH AND DUCK A LITTLE EVERY TIME THE CRASH COMES AND I COULDN'T GET OVER IT I WAS A TREAT TO THE OTHER WORKMEN IN THAT ROOM
2573-178449-0027 THEY'LL BE GLAD TO SEE ME BACK THEY USED TO LAUGH AT ME ALL DAY LONG MARY'S GAZE WAS AVERTED FROM BIBBS NOW SHE SAT WITH HER ELBOW RESTING ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR HER LIFTED HAND PRESSED AGAINST HER CHEEK SHE WAS STARING AT THE WALL AND HER EYES HAD A BURNING BRIGHTNESS IN THEM
2573-178449-0028 IT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE ANY ONE COULD DO THAT TO YOU SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE NO HE'S NOT KIND HE OUGHT TO BE PROUD TO HELP YOU TO THE LEISURE TO WRITE BOOKS IT SHOULD BE HIS GREATEST PRIVILEGE TO HAVE THEM PUBLISHED FOR YOU
2573-178449-0029 THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE POOR LITTLE THINGS I'VE TRIED TO DO YOU WOULDN'T LET ME BUT I KNOW YOU COULD AH IT'S A PITY IT ISN'T SAID BIBBS HONESTLY I NEVER COULD
2573-178449-0030 SHE GAVE HIM A FLASHING GLANCE AND IT WAS AS KIND AS HE SAID SHE WAS THAT SOUNDS WRONG SHE SAID IMPULSIVELY I MEAN MISS VERTREES I'VE THOUGHT OF YOU BY YOUR FIRST NAME EVER SINCE I MET YOU WOULDN'T YOU RATHER CALL ME MARY
2573-178449-0031 BIBBS WAS DAZZLED HE DREW A LONG DEEP BREATH AND DID NOT SPEAK WOULDN'T YOU SHE ASKED WITHOUT A TRACE OF COQUETRY IF I CAN HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AH THAT'S VERY PRETTY SHE LAUGHED YOU'RE SUCH AN HONEST PERSON
2573-178449-0032 IT'S PLEASANT TO HAVE YOU GALLANT SOMETIMES BY WAY OF VARIETY SHE BECAME GRAVE AGAIN IMMEDIATELY I HEAR MYSELF LAUGHING AS IF IT WERE SOME ONE ELSE IT SOUNDS LIKE LAUGHTER ON THE EVE OF A GREAT CALAMITY
2573-178449-0033 YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO THAT PLACE HE NODDED AND THE OTHER TIME YOU DID IT JUST OVER IT SAID BIBBS TWO YEARS
2573-178449-0034 SO MUCH AS WHAT SHE PROMPTED AS HE STOPPED
2573-178449-0035 I WANT TO SAY IT BUT BUT I COME TO A DEAD BALK WHEN I TRY I GO ON SAY IT WHATEVER IT IS SHE BADE HIM YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO SAY ANYTHING I SHOULDN'T LIKE
2573-178449-0036 I DOUBT IF YOU'D EITHER LIKE OR DISLIKE WHAT I WANT TO SAY HE RETURNED MOVING UNCOMFORTABLY IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIS FEET HE SEEMED TO FEEL AWKWARD THOROUGHLY YOU SEE ALL MY LIFE UNTIL I MET YOU IF I EVER FELT LIKE
2573-178449-0037 SAYING ANYTHING I WROTE IT INSTEAD SAYING THINGS IS A NEW TRICK FOR ME AND THIS WELL IT'S JUST THIS I USED TO FEEL AS IF I HADN'T EVER HAD ANY SORT OF A LIFE AT ALL
2573-178449-0038 I'D NEVER BEEN OF USE TO ANYTHING OR ANYBODY AND I'D NEVER HAD ANYTHING MYSELF EXCEPT A KIND OF HAPHAZARD THINKING BUT NOW IT'S DIFFERENT I'M STILL OF NO USE TO ANYBODY AND I DON'T SEE ANY PROSPECT OF BEING USEFUL BUT
2573-178449-0039 I MEAN I'M GLAD I'VE LIVED
2573-178449-0040 IT'S YOUR LETTING ME BE NEAR YOU SOMETIMES AS YOU HAVE THIS STRANGE BEAUTIFUL HAPPY LITTLE WHILE HE DID NOT ONCE LOOK UP AND REACHED SILENCE AT THE END OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY WITH HIS EYES STILL AWKWARDLY REGARDING HIS FEET
2573-178449-0041 SHE DID NOT SPEAK BUT A SOFT RUSTLING OF HER GARMENTS LET HIM KNOW THAT SHE HAD GONE BACK TO HER CHAIR AGAIN THE HOUSE WAS STILL THE SHABBY OLD ROOM WAS SO QUIET THAT THE SOUND OF A CREAKING IN THE WALL SEEMED SHARP AND LOUD
2573-178449-0042 AND YET WHEN MARY SPOKE AT LAST HER VOICE WAS BARELY AUDIBLE
2573-178449-0043 YOU'D WANT TO TO MAKE IT LAST YES SAID BIBBS AS FAINTLY YOU'D WANT TO GO ON BEING MY FRIEND AS LONG AS WE LIVE WOULDN'T YOU YES HE GULPED BUT YOU MAKE THAT KIND OF SPEECH TO ME BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S OVER
2573-178449-0044 YOU DO THINK THAT SHE ROSE TO HER FEET AGAIN AND CAME AND STOOD BEFORE HIM OR YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO SEND YOU BACK TO THE SANITARIUM DON'T DENY IT BIBBS THERE
2573-178449-0045 YOU SEE I'M A FRIEND OR I COULDN'T DO IT WELL IF YOU MEANT WHAT YOU SAID AND YOU DID MEAN IT I KNOW IT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO THE SANITARIUM
2573-178449-0046 AND NOW BIBBS LOOKED UP SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM STRAIGHT AND TALL SPLENDID IN GENEROUS STRENGTH HER EYES SHINING AND WET IF I MEAN THAT MUCH TO YOU SHE CRIED THEY CAN'T HARM YOU GO BACK TO THE SHOP BUT COME TO ME WHEN YOUR DAY'S WORK IS DONE
2573-178449-0047 LET THE MACHINES CRASH THEIR SIXTY EIGHT TIMES A MINUTE BUT REMEMBER EACH CRASH THAT DEAFENS YOU IS THAT MUCH NEARER THE EVENING AND ME HE STUMBLED TO HIS FEET YOU SAY HE GASPED
2573-178449-0048 HE COULD ONLY STARE BEWILDERED EVERY EVENING I WANT YOU THEY SHA'N'T HURT YOU AGAIN AND SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO HIM IT WAS STRONG AND WARM IN HIS TREMULOUS CLASP IF I COULD I'D GO AND FEED THE STRIPS OF ZINC TO THE MACHINE WITH YOU SHE SAID
2573-178449-0049 BUT ALL DAY LONG I'LL SEND MY THOUGHTS TO YOU YOU MUST KEEP REMEMBERING THAT YOUR FRIEND STANDS BESIDE YOU AND WHEN THE WORK IS DONE WON'T THE NIGHT MAKE UP FOR THE DAY LIGHT SEEMED TO GLOW FROM HER HE WAS BLINDED BY THAT RADIANCE OF KINDNESS
2573-178449-0050 BUT ALL HE COULD SAY WAS HUSKILY TO THINK YOU'RE THERE WITH ME STANDING BESIDE THE OLD ZINC EATER AND THEY LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND AT LAST BIBBS FOUND WHAT IT MEANT NOT TO BE ALONE IN THE WORLD
