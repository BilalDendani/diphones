7672-96507-0000 THE GOLD MINER AS FOR VAN EMMON HIS EXPERIENCE WILL HAVE TO BE CLASSED WITH SMITH'S THAT IS TO SAY HE SOON CAME TO FEEL THAT HIS AGENT WAS NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED HUMAN
7672-96507-0001 IT WAS ALL TOO DIFFERENT HOWEVER HE FOUND HIMSELF ENJOYING A FIELD OF VIEW WHICH WAS A DECIDED IMPROVEMENT UPON SMITH'S INSTEAD OF A RANGE WHICH
7672-96507-0002 BEGAN AND ENDED JUST ABOVE THE HORIZON HIS AGENT POSSESSED THE POWER OF LOOKING ALMOST STRAIGHT AHEAD THIS TOLD THE GEOLOGIST
7672-96507-0003 OF HUMAN OCCUPANCY ALL ARGUED THAT THE TWO MEN HAD HIT UPON THE SAME TYPE OF AGENT IN VAN EMMON'S CASE HOWEVER HE COULD OCCASIONALLY GLIMPSE TWO LOOSE PARTS OF THE MACHINE
7672-96507-0004 WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE OBSERVER AND AT THE FRONT NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT IT VAN EMMON CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AS SMITH THE OPERATOR WAS LOOKING INTO SOMETHING LIKE A PERISCOPE PERHAPS
7672-96507-0005 HE HIMSELF DID NOT DO THE DRIVING FROM WHAT THE GEOLOGIST COULD SEE OF THE COUNTRY BELOW IT WAS QUITE CERTAINLY CULTIVATED IN NO OTHER WAY COULD THE EVEN ROWS AND UNIFORM GROWTH BE EXPLAINED
7672-96507-0006 EVEN THOUGH VAN EMMON COULD NOT SAY WHETHER THE VEGETATION WERE TREE SHRUB OR PLANT IT WAS CERTAINLY THE WORK OF MAN OR SOME THING MIGHTILY LIKE MAN SHORTLY
7672-96507-0007 HE EXPERIENCED AN ABRUPT DOWNWARD DIVE SUCH AS UPSET HIS SENSES SOMEWHAT WHEN HE RECOVERED
7672-96507-0008 AND THEN THE GEOLOGIST SAW SOMETHING THAT CHALLENGED HIS UNDERSTANDING THE CRAFT HAD LANDED ON THE RIM OF A DEEP PIT OR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A PIT
7672-96507-0009 AND SEEMINGLY COVERED WITH FROST FOR IT SPARKLED SO BRIGHTLY IN THE SUN AS TO ACTUALLY HURT THE EYES IN FACT THE GEOLOGIST'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS A GLACIER
7672-96507-0010 ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT CONCEIVE OF ICE OR SNOW OF THAT TINT RUNNING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE PIT WERE A NUMBER OF DARK BROWN STREAKS ABOUT A YARD WIDE
7672-96507-0011 VAN EMMON COULD MAKE THEM OUT MORE OR LESS CLEARLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PIT AS WELL FROM THE IRREGULAR WAY IN WHICH THE WALLS WERE FORMED HE QUICKLY DECIDED THAT THE PIT WAS A NATURAL ONE THE STREAKS HE THOUGHT
7672-96507-0012 THE GEOLOGIST WONDERED JUST HOW THE CRAFT'S WHEELS WERE OPERATED NEXT HE WAS HOLDING HIS BREATH AS THE MACHINE REACHED SO STEEP A POINT IN THE SLOPE THAT MOST SURELY NO BRAKES COULD HOLD IT SIMULTANEOUSLY
7672-96507-0013 HE HEARD THE HISS AND WHINE WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE THE SUCTION DEVICE IT WAS A WHOLE LOT LIKE GOING DOWN INTO A PLACER MINE THE GEOLOGIST AFTERWARD SAID AND IN VIEW OF WHAT NEXT MET HIS EYES
7672-96507-0014 HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN HIS GUESS DOWN CREPT THE MACHINE UNTIL IT WAS STANDING ON ITS NOSE THE SUN WAS SHINING ALMOST STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE SLOPE
7672-96507-0015 AND VAN EMMON FORGOT HIS UNEASINESS ABOUT THE CRAFT IN HIS INTEREST IN WHAT HE SAW THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT WAS PERHAPS TWENTY FEET IN DIAMETER AND ROUGHLY HEMISPHERICAL STANDING UP FROM ITS BOTTOM
7672-96507-0016 WERE HALF A DOZEN SLIM FORMATIONS LIKE IDEALIZED STALAGMITES THEY WERE MADE OF SOME SEMITRANSPARENT ROCK APPARENTLY THE TINT BEING A REDDISH YELLOW FINALLY
7672-96507-0017 WAS A STONE AND SURROUNDING THESE SIX LANDMARKS AS VAN EMMON CALLED THEM WAS THE MOST PRODIGIOUS DISPLAY OF WEALTH IMAGINABLE FOR THE WHOLE QUEER PLACE
7672-96507-0018 WAS SIMPLY SPRINKLED WITH GOLD GOLD GOLD EVERYWHERE LARGE NUGGETS OF IT AS BIG AS ONE'S FIST NOT EMBEDDED IN ROCK
7672-96507-0019 NOT SCATTERED THROUGH SAND BUT LYING LOOSE UPON THE SURFACE OF THAT UNBELIEVABLE ORANGE SNOW IT WAS OVERWHELMING
7672-96507-0020 OPERATING SOME UNSEEN MACHINERY HE CAUSED THREE SHOVEL LIKE DEVICES TO PROJECT FROM THE FRONT OF HIS MACHINE AND THESE INSTANTLY PROCEEDED SO SWIFTLY THAT VAN EMMON COULD NOT POSSIBLY WATCH THEIR ACTION
7672-96507-0021 SUDDENLY THE SANUSIAN WHEELED HIS MACHINE ABOUT AND STARTED HURRIEDLY UP THE SLOPE
7672-96507-0022 FOR HE TOOK FLIGHT AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE PIT AND HE LEFT HALF A MILLION IN GOLD BEHIND HIM THIS NEW FLIGHT HAD NOT LASTED TWO MINUTES BEFORE THE GEOLOGIST BEGAN TO NOTE OTHER OBJECTS IN THE AIR
7672-96507-0023 THERE WERE BIRDS SO DISTANT THAT HE COULD NOT IDENTIFY THEM ONE CAME NEAR ENOUGH HOWEVER FOR HIM TO CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS A HAWK
7672-96507-0024 VAN EMMON'S AGENT TURNED HIS MYSTERIOUS PERISCOPE SO AS TO TAKE IT ALL IN AND THE GEOLOGIST WAS ABLE TO WATCH HIS FILL WHEREUPON HE BECAME CONVERTED TO A NEW IDEA
7672-96507-0025 THE BIRDS THAT SMITH AND HE HAD SEEN HAD NOT BEEN BIRDS AT ALL BUT AIRCRAFT BUILT IN IMITATION OF THEM
7672-96507-0026 ALMOST PERFECT IMITATION OF A BEE IT WAS VERY CLOSE TO AN EXACT REPRODUCTION FOR ONE EXCEPTION IT DID NOT HAVE THE HAIRY APPEARANCE SO CHARACTERISTIC OF BEES
7672-96507-0027 THE BODY AND LEGS WERE SMOOTH AND SHINY LATER VAN EMMON SAW MACHINES WHICH WENT SO FAR AS EVEN TO IMITATE THE HAIRS ALSO
7672-96507-0028 A PERFECTLY ROUND REPRESENTATION OF A SINGLE EYE WAS BUILT LIKE A CONNING TOWER TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE BOW PRESUMABLY THE OBSERVER SAT OR STOOD WITHIN THIS HEAD
7672-96507-0029 BUT OTHERWISE
7672-96507-0030 VAN EMMON WAS STRONGLY REMINDED OF WHAT HE HAD ONCE VIEWED UNDER A POWERFUL LENS THE FRAGILE SEMITRANSPARENT WINGS THE MISSHAPEN LEGS
7672-96507-0031 HE COULD NOT SEE HOW ANY INTELLIGENT BEING WOULD MAKE USE OF THEM THEY WERE CONTINUALLY WAVING ABOUT MUCH AS BEES WAVE THEIRS
7672-96507-0032 EVIDENTLY THESE WERE THE LOOSE OBJECTS HE HAD ALREADY NOTED NOW HE WONDERED
7672-96507-0033 THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THEY WERE WIRELESS ANTENNAE FOR PRESENTLY THE NEWCOMER
7672-96507-0034 SENT OUT A MESSAGE WHICH WAS READ AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS RECEIVED BY VAN EMMON'S AGENT AND AS UNCONSCIOUSLY TRANSLATED NUMBER EIGHT HUNDRED FOUR YOU ARE WANTED ON PLOT SEVENTEEN WHEREUPON
7672-96507-0035 VAN EMMON'S UNKNOWN ASSISTANT REPLIED AT ONCE VERY WELL SUPERIOR IT WAS DONE BY MEANS OF AN EXTREMELY FAINT HUMMING DEVICE REMINDING THE GEOLOGIST OF CERTAIN WIRELESS APPARATA HE HAD HEARD
7672-96507-0036 EYE BUT HE COULD NOT BE SURE THE GLASS OR WHATEVER IT WAS REFLECTED EVERYTHING WITHIN RANGE WAS THE AIRMAN A
7672-96507-0037 DID HE SIT OR STAND UPRIGHT LIKE A MAN OR DID HE USE ALL FOUR LIMBS ANIMAL FASHION VAN EMMON HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE COULD NOT TELL NO WONDER HE DIDN'T GUESS THE TRUTH
7672-96507-0038 PRESENTLY COMING TO ANOTHER NAUSEA PRODUCING STOP ONCE MORE VAN EMMON WAS TEMPORARILY HELPLESS WHEN HE COULD LOOK AGAIN HE SAW THAT THE MACHINE HAD LANDED UPON A STEEP SLOPE
7672-96507-0039 THIS TIME WITH ITS NOSE POINTING UPWARD FAR ABOVE WAS WHAT LOOKED LIKE A CAVE WITH A GROWTH OF SOME QUEER BLACK GRASS ON ITS UPPER RIM THE CRAFT COMMENCED TO MOVE UPWARD
7672-96507-0040 OVER A SMOOTH DARK TAN SURFACE IN HALF A MINUTE THE MACHINE HAD REACHED THE TOP OF THE SLOPE AND THE GEOLOGIST LOOKED EAGERLY FOR WHAT MIGHT LIE WITHIN THE CAVE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IT WAS NOT A CAVE AT ALL
7672-96507-0041 INSTEAD ANOTHER BROWN SLOPE OR RATHER A BULGING PRECIPICE OCCUPIED THIS DEPRESSION VAN EMMON LOOKED CLOSER
7672-96507-0042 AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS BULGE WAS A QUEER FRINGE OF THE SAME KIND OF GRASS THAT SHOWED ON TOP OF IT VAN EMMON LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE THING DAWNED UPON HIM
7672-96507-0043 THIS STUPENDOUS AFFAIR WAS NO MOUNTAINSIDE IT WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN THE HEAD OF A COLOSSAL STATUE A MAMMOTH EDITION OF THE GODDESS OF LIBERTY
7672-96507-0044 AND THE AIRCRAFT HAD PRESUMED TO ALIGHT UPON ITS CHEEK THE MACHINE CLUNG THERE MOTIONLESS FOR SOME TIME QUITE AS THOUGH THE AIRMAN KNEW THAT VAN EMMON WOULD LIKE TO LOOK A LONG WHILE
7672-96507-0045 MAKING OUT A SMALL SECTION OF THE NOSE ALSO THE HUGE CURVES OF A DUST COVERED EAR
7672-96507-0046 NEXT SECOND CAME THE EARTHQUAKE THE WHOLE STATUE ROCKED AND SWAYED VAN EMMON LOOKED TO SEE THE MACHINE THROWN OFF FROM THE BASE OF THE MONUMENT CAME A SINGLE TERRIFIC SOUND
7672-96507-0047 A VERITABLE ROAR AS THOUGH THE THING WAS BEING WRENCHED FROM THE HEART OF THE EARTH FROM SOMEWHERE ON TOP CAME A SPURT OF WATER THAT SPLASHED JUST BESIDE THE CRAFT THEN
7672-96507-0048 CAME THE MOST TERRIBLE THING WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WARNING THE STATUE'S GREAT EYE OPENED OPENED WIDE
7672-96507-0049 BLAZED WITH WRATH THE STATUE WAS ALIVE NEXT SECOND THE SANUSIAN SHOT INTO THE AIR A MOMENT AND VAN EMMON WAS ABLE TO LOOK AGAIN
7672-96507-0050 AND AS IT HAPPENED THE CRAFT WAS NOW CIRCLING THE AMAZING THING IT HAD JUST QUIT
7672-96507-0051 THAT HE WAS DEAD SURE OF WHAT HE SAW HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN WANTING TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE RESTING ON THE SOLID EARTH WAS A HUMAN HEAD ABOUT FIFTY YARDS WIDE AND
7672-96507-0052 PROPORTIONATELY AS TALL IT WAS ALIVE BUT IT WAS ONLY THE HEAD
