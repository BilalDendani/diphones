4474-14186-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN SHOALS AND QUICKSANDS WHEN I ARRIVED AT ENDSLEY GARDENS MISS GIBSON WAS AT HOME AND TO MY UNSPEAKABLE RELIEF MISSUS HORNBY WAS NOT MY VENERATION FOR THAT LADY'S MORAL QUALITIES WAS EXCESSIVE
4474-14186-0001 BUT HER CONVERSATION DROVE ME TO THE VERGE OF INSANITY AN INSANITY NOT ENTIRELY FREE FROM HOMICIDAL TENDENCIES IT IS GOOD OF YOU TO COME THOUGH I THOUGHT YOU WOULD MISS GIBSON SAID IMPULSIVELY AS WE SHOOK HANDS
4474-14186-0002 BOTH YOU AND DOCTOR THORNDYKE SO FREE FROM PROFESSIONAL STIFFNESS MY AUNT WENT OFF TO SEE MISTER LAWLEY DIRECTLY WE GOT WALTER'S TELEGRAM I AM SORRY FOR HER I SAID AND WAS ON THE POINT OF ADDING AND HIM
4474-14186-0003 BUT FORTUNATELY A GLIMMER OF SENSE RESTRAINED ME SHE WILL FIND HIM DRY ENOUGH YES I DISLIKE HIM EXTREMELY DO YOU KNOW THAT HE HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO ADVISE REUBEN TO PLEAD GUILTY HE TOLD US HE HAD DONE SO
4474-14186-0004 AND GOT A WELL DESERVED SNUBBING FROM THORNDYKE FOR HIS PAINS I AM SO GLAD EXCLAIMED MISS GIBSON VICIOUSLY BUT TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED WALTER SIMPLY SAID TRANSFERRED TO HIGHER COURT WHICH WE AGREED WAS TO MEAN COMMITTED FOR TRIAL
4474-14186-0005 HAS THE DEFENCE FAILED AND WHERE IS REUBEN THE DEFENCE IS RESERVED
4474-14186-0006 AND THAT BEING SO DECIDED THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO KEEP THE PROSECUTION IN THE DARK AS TO THE LINE OF DEFENCE YOU SEE IF THE POLICE KNEW WHAT THE DEFENCE WAS TO BE THEY COULD REVISE THEIR OWN PLANS ACCORDINGLY I SEE THAT
4474-14186-0007 BUT I AM DREADFULLY DISAPPOINTED I HAD HOPED THAT DOCTOR THORNDYKE WOULD GET THE CASE DISMISSED
4474-14186-0008 THIS WAS THE QUESTION THAT I HAD DREADED AND NOW THAT I HAD TO ANSWER IT I CLEARED MY THROAT AND BENT MY GAZE NERVOUSLY ON THE FLOOR THE MAGISTRATE REFUSED BAIL I SAID AFTER AN UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE WELL
4474-14186-0009 CONSEQUENTLY REUBEN HAS BEEN
4474-14186-0010 DETAINED IN CUSTODY YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE SENT HIM TO PRISON SHE EXCLAIMED BREATHLESSLY NOT AS A CONVICTED PRISONER YOU KNOW HE IS MERELY DETAINED PENDING HIS TRIAL BUT IN PRISON YES I WAS FORCED TO ADMIT
4474-14186-0011 IN HOLLOWAY PRISON SHE LOOKED ME STONILY IN THE FACE FOR SOME SECONDS PALE AND WIDE EYED BUT SILENT THEN WITH A SUDDEN CATCH IN HER BREATH SHE TURNED AWAY
4474-14186-0012 AND GRASPING THE EDGE OF THE MANTEL SHELF LAID HER HEAD UPON HER ARM AND BURST INTO A PASSION OF SOBBING NOW I AM NOT IN GENERAL AN EMOTIONAL MAN NOR EVEN ESPECIALLY IMPULSIVE BUT NEITHER AM I A STOCK OR A STONE OR AN EFFIGY OF WOOD
4474-14186-0013 SO NATURAL AND UNSELFISH OF THIS STRONG BRAVE LOYAL HEARTED WOMAN IN EFFECT I MOVED TO HER SIDE AND GENTLY TAKING IN MINE THE HAND THAT HUNG DOWN MURMURED SOME INCOHERENT WORDS OF CONSOLATION IN A PARTICULARLY HUSKY VOICE
4474-14186-0014 PRESENTLY SHE RECOVERED HERSELF SOMEWHAT AND SOFTLY WITHDREW HER HAND AS SHE TURNED TOWARDS ME DRYING HER EYES YOU MUST FORGIVE ME FOR DISTRESSING YOU AS I FEAR I HAVE SHE SAID FOR YOU ARE SO KIND AND I FEEL THAT YOU ARE REALLY MY FRIEND AND REUBEN'S
4474-14186-0015 I AM INDEED DEAR MISS GIBSON I REPLIED AND SO I ASSURE YOU IS MY COLLEAGUE I AM SURE OF IT SHE REJOINED BUT I WAS SO UNPREPARED FOR THIS I CANNOT SAY WHY EXCEPTING THAT I TRUSTED SO ENTIRELY IN DOCTOR THORNDYKE
4474-14186-0016 AND IT IS SO HORRIBLE AND ABOVE ALL SO DREADFULLY SUGGESTIVE OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN UP TO NOW THE WHOLE THING HAS SEEMED LIKE A NIGHTMARE TERRIFYING BUT YET UNREAL BUT NOW THAT HE IS ACTUALLY IN PRISON IT HAS SUDDENLY BECOME A DREADFUL REALITY AND I AM OVERWHELMED WITH TERROR
4474-14186-0017 FOR PITY'S SAKE DOCTOR JERVIS TELL ME WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT COULD I DO I HAD HEARD THORNDYKE'S WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO REUBEN
4474-14186-0018 DOUBTLESS MY PROPER COURSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO KEEP MY OWN COUNSEL AND PUT MISS GIBSON OFF WITH CAUTIOUS AMBIGUITIES BUT I COULD NOT SHE WAS WORTHY OF MORE CONFIDENCE THAN THAT YOU MUST NOT BE UNDULY ALARMED ABOUT THE FUTURE I SAID
4474-14186-0019 I HAVE IT FROM DOCTOR THORNDYKE THAT HE IS CONVINCED OF REUBEN'S INNOCENCE AND IS HOPEFUL OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE WORLD BUT I DID NOT HAVE THIS TO REPEAT I ADDED WITH A SLIGHT QUALM OF CONSCIENCE I KNOW SHE SAID SOFTLY
4474-14186-0020 AND I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART AND AS TO THIS PRESENT MISFORTUNE I CONTINUED
4474-14186-0021 TRY TO THINK OF IT AS OF A SURGICAL OPERATION WHICH IS A DREADFUL THING IN ITSELF BUT IS ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF SOMETHING WHICH IS IMMEASURABLY MORE DREADFUL I WILL TRY TO DO AS YOU TELL ME SHE ANSWERED MEEKLY BUT IT IS SO SHOCKING TO THINK OF A CULTIVATED GENTLEMAN LIKE REUBEN
4474-14186-0022 HERDED WITH COMMON THIEVES AND MURDERERS AND LOCKED IN A CAGE LIKE SOME WILD ANIMAL THINK OF THE IGNOMINY AND DEGRADATION THERE IS NO IGNOMINY IN BEING WRONGFULLY ACCUSED I SAID A LITTLE GUILTILY I MUST OWN
4474-14186-0023 FOR THORNDYKE'S WORDS CAME BACK TO ME WITH ALL THEIR FORCE
4474-14186-0024 AND NOTHING BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF A PASSING INCONVENIENCE TO LOOK BACK UPON SHE GAVE HER EYES A FINAL WIPE AND RESOLUTELY PUT AWAY HER HANDKERCHIEF
4474-14186-0025 AND CHASED AWAY MY TERROR I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW I FEEL YOUR GOODNESS NOR HAVE I ANY THANK OFFERING TO MAKE EXCEPT THE PROMISE TO BE BRAVE AND PATIENT HENCEFORTH AND TRUST IN YOU ENTIRELY SHE SAID THIS WITH SUCH A GRATEFUL SMILE
4474-14186-0026 AND LOOKED WITHAL SO SWEET AND WOMANLY THAT I WAS SEIZED WITH AN OVERPOWERING IMPULSE TO TAKE HER IN MY ARMS INSTEAD OF THIS I SAID WITH CONSCIOUS FEEBLENESS
4474-14186-0027 WHICH YOU MUST REMEMBER COMES FROM ME SECOND HAND AFTER ALL IT IS TO DOCTOR THORNDYKE THAT WE ALL LOOK FOR ULTIMATE DELIVERANCE I KNOW BUT IT IS YOU WHO CAME TO COMFORT ME IN MY TROUBLE SO YOU SEE THE HONOURS ARE DIVIDED
4474-14186-0028 AND NOT DIVIDED QUITE EQUALLY I FEAR FOR WOMEN ARE UNREASONING CREATURES AS NO DOUBT YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS INFORMED YOU
4474-14186-0029 BUT BEFORE YOU GO YOU MUST TELL ME HOW AND WHEN I CAN SEE REUBEN I WANT TO SEE HIM AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT POOR FELLOW HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO FEEL THAT HIS FRIENDS HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM EVEN FOR A SINGLE INSTANT YOU CAN SEE HIM TO MORROW IF YOU LIKE I SAID
4474-14186-0030 AND CASTING MY GOOD RESOLUTIONS TO THE WINDS I ADDED I SHALL BE GOING TO SEE HIM MYSELF AND PERHAPS DOCTOR THORNDYKE WILL GO
4474-14186-0031 SHOULD I BE MUCH IN THE WAY IT IS RATHER AN ALARMING THING TO GO TO A PRISON ALONE IT IS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF I ANSWERED
4474-14186-0032 IT IS ON THE WAY WE CAN DRIVE TO HOLLOWAY TOGETHER I SUPPOSE YOU ARE RESOLVED TO GO IT WILL BE RATHER UNPLEASANT AS YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE I AM QUITE RESOLVED WHAT TIME SHALL I COME TO THE TEMPLE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IF THAT WILL SUIT YOU
4474-14186-0033 VERY WELL I WILL BE PUNCTUAL AND NOW YOU MUST GO OR YOU WILL BE CAUGHT SHE PUSHED ME GENTLY TOWARDS THE DOOR AND HOLDING OUT HER HAND SAID I HAVEN'T THANKED YOU HALF ENOUGH AND I NEVER CAN GOOD BYE SHE WAS GONE AND I STOOD ALONE IN THE STREET
4474-14186-0034 UP WHICH YELLOWISH WREATHS OF FOG WERE BEGINNING TO ROLL
4474-14186-0035 THE LIGHT WAS FAILING AND THE HOUSES DWINDLING INTO DIM UNREAL SHAPES THAT VANISHED AT HALF THEIR HEIGHT NEVERTHELESS I STEPPED OUT BRISKLY AND STRODE ALONG AT A GOOD PACE AS A YOUNG MAN IS APT TO DO WHEN HIS MIND IS IN SOMEWHAT OF A FERMENT
4474-14186-0036 IN TRUTH I HAD A GOOD DEAL TO OCCUPY MY THOUGHTS AND AS WILL OFTEN HAPPEN BOTH TO YOUNG MEN AND OLD THOSE MATTERS THAT BORE MOST DIRECTLY UPON MY OWN LIFE AND PROSPECTS WERE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE ATTENTION WHAT SORT OF RELATIONS WERE GROWING UP BETWEEN JULIET GIBSON AND ME
4474-14186-0037 AND WHAT WAS MY POSITION AS TO HERS IT SEEMED PLAIN ENOUGH SHE WAS WRAPPED UP IN REUBEN HORNBY AND I WAS HER VERY GOOD FRIEND BECAUSE I WAS HIS BUT FOR MYSELF THERE WAS NO DISGUISING THE FACT THAT I WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN HER THAT BODED ILL FOR MY PEACE OF MIND
4474-14186-0038 NEVER HAD I MET A WOMAN WHO SO ENTIRELY REALISED MY CONCEPTION OF WHAT A WOMAN SHOULD BE NOR ONE WHO EXERCISED SO GREAT A CHARM OVER ME HER STRENGTH AND DIGNITY HER SOFTNESS AND DEPENDENCY TO SAY NOTHING OF HER BEAUTY
4474-14186-0039 FITTED HER WITH THE NECESSARY WEAPONS FOR MY COMPLETE AND UTTER SUBJUGATION AND UTTERLY SUBJUGATED I WAS THERE WAS NO USE IN DENYING THE FACT EVEN THOUGH I REALISED ALREADY THAT THE TIME WOULD PRESENTLY COME WHEN SHE WOULD WANT ME NO MORE
4474-14186-0040 AND THERE WOULD REMAIN NO REMEDY FOR ME BUT TO GO AWAY AND TRY TO FORGET HER BUT WAS I ACTING AS A MAN OF HONOUR TO THIS I FELT I COULD FAIRLY ANSWER YES FOR I WAS BUT DOING MY DUTY AND COULD HARDLY ACT DIFFERENTLY IF I WISHED TO
4474-14186-0041 BESIDES I WAS JEOPARDISING NO ONE'S HAPPINESS BUT MY OWN AND A MAN MAY DO AS HE PLEASES WITH HIS OWN HAPPINESS NO EVEN THORNDYKE COULD NOT ACCUSE ME OF DISHONOURABLE CONDUCT PRESENTLY MY THOUGHTS TOOK A FRESH TURN
4474-14186-0042 HERE WAS A STARTLING DEVELOPMENT INDEED AND I WONDERED WHAT DIFFERENCE IT WOULD MAKE IN THORNDYKE'S HYPOTHESIS OF THE CRIME WHAT HIS THEORY WAS I HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GUESS BUT AS I WALKED ALONG THROUGH THE THICKENING FOG I TRIED TO FIT THIS NEW FACT INTO OUR COLLECTION OF DATA
4474-14186-0043 AND DETERMINE ITS BEARINGS AND SIGNIFICANCE IN THIS FOR A TIME I FAILED UTTERLY THE RED THUMB MARK FILLED MY FIELD OF VISION TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL ELSE TO ME AS TO EVERYONE ELSE BUT THORNDYKE THIS FACT WAS FINAL
4474-14186-0044 AND POINTED TO A CONCLUSION THAT WAS UNANSWERABLE BUT AS I TURNED THE STORY OF THE CRIME OVER AND OVER THERE CAME TO ME PRESENTLY AN IDEA THAT SET IN MOTION A NEW AND VERY STARTLING TRAIN OF THOUGHT COULD MISTER HORNBY HIMSELF BE THE THIEF
4474-14186-0045 HIS FAILURE APPEARED SUDDEN TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD
4474-14186-0046 THERE INDEED WAS THE THUMB MARK ON THE LEAF WHICH HE HAD TORN FROM HIS POCKET BLOCK YES BUT WHO HAD SEEN HIM TEAR IT OFF NO ONE THE FACT RESTED ON HIS BARE STATEMENT BUT THE THUMB MARK WELL IT WAS POSSIBLE THOUGH UNLIKELY
4474-14186-0047 STILL POSSIBLE THAT THE MARK MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE ACCIDENTALLY ON SOME PREVIOUS OCCASION AND FORGOTTEN BY REUBEN OR EVEN UNNOTICED MISTER HORNBY HAD SEEN THE THUMBOGRAPH IN FACT HIS OWN MARK WAS IN IT
4474-14186-0048 AND SO WOULD HAVE HAD HIS ATTENTION DIRECTED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF FINGER PRINTS IN IDENTIFICATION HE MIGHT HAVE KEPT THE MARKED PAPER FOR FUTURE USE AND ON THE OCCASION OF THE ROBBERY
4474-14186-0049 AND SLIPPED IT INTO THE SAFE AS A SURE MEANS OF DIVERTING SUSPICION ALL THIS WAS IMPROBABLE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
4474-14186-0050 AND AS TO THE UNSPEAKABLE BASENESS OF THE DEED WHAT ACTION IS TOO BASE FOR A GAMBLER IN DIFFICULTIES I WAS SO MUCH EXCITED AND ELATED BY MY OWN INGENUITY IN HAVING FORMED AN INTELLIGIBLE AND PRACTICABLE THEORY OF THE CRIME
4474-14186-0051 THAT I WAS NOW IMPATIENT TO REACH HOME THAT I MIGHT IMPART MY NEWS TO THORNDYKE AND SEE HOW THEY AFFECTED HIM BUT AS I APPROACHED THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN THE FOG GREW SO DENSE THAT ALL MY ATTENTION WAS NEEDED TO ENABLE ME TO THREAD MY WAY SAFELY THROUGH THE TRAFFIC
4474-14186-0052 WHILE THE STRANGE DECEPTIVE ASPECT THAT IT LENT TO FAMILIAR OBJECTS AND THE OBLITERATION OF LANDMARKS MADE MY PROGRESS SO SLOW
4474-14186-0053 WHEN I FELT MY WAY DOWN MIDDLE TEMPLE LANE AND CREPT THROUGH CROWN OFFICE ROW TOWARDS MY COLLEAGUE'S CHAMBERS ON THE DOORSTEP I FOUND POLTON PEERING WITH ANXIOUS FACE INTO THE BLANK EXPANSE OF YELLOW VAPOUR THE DOCTOR'S LATE SIR SAID HE
4474-14186-0054 DETAINED BY THE FOG I EXPECT IT MUST BE PRETTY THICK IN THE BOROUGH I MAY MENTION THAT TO POLTON THORNDYKE WAS THE DOCTOR OTHER INFERIOR CREATURES THERE WERE INDEED TO WHOM THE TITLE OF DOCTOR IN A WAY APPERTAINED
4474-14186-0055 BUT THEY WERE OF NO ACCOUNT IN POLTON'S EYES SURNAMES WERE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM YES IT MUST BE I REPLIED JUDGING BY THE CONDITION OF THE STRAND I ENTERED AND ASCENDED THE STAIRS
4474-14186-0056 GLAD ENOUGH OF THE PROSPECT OF A WARM AND WELL LIGHTED ROOM AFTER MY COMFORTLESS GROPING IN THE MURKY STREETS AND POLTON WITH A FINAL GLANCE UP AND DOWN THE WALK RELUCTANTLY FOLLOWED YOU WOULD LIKE SOME TEA SIR I EXPECT SAID HE AS HE LET ME IN
4474-14186-0057 THOUGH I HAD A KEY OF MY OWN NOW I THOUGHT I SHOULD AND HE ACCORDINGLY SET ABOUT THE PREPARATIONS IN HIS DEFT METHODICAL WAY BUT WITH AN AIR OF ABSTRACTION THAT WAS UNUSUAL WITH HIM THE DOCTOR SAID HE SHOULD BE HOME BY FIVE HE REMARKED
4474-14186-0058 AS HE LAID THE TEA POT ON THE TRAY THEN HE IS A DEFAULTER I ANSWERED WE SHALL HAVE TO WATER HIS TEA A WONDERFUL PUNCTUAL MAN SIR IS THE DOCTOR PURSUED POLTON KEEPS HIS TIME TO THE MINUTE AS A RULE HE DOES
4474-14186-0059 YOU CAN'T KEEP YOUR TIME TO A MINUTE IN A LONDON PARTICULAR I SAID A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR I WISHED TO BE ALONE THAT I MIGHT THINK OVER MATTERS AND POLTON'S NERVOUS FLUTTERINGS IRRITATED ME SOMEWHAT HE WAS ALMOST AS BAD AS A FEMALE HOUSEKEEPER
4474-14186-0060 THE LITTLE MAN EVIDENTLY PERCEIVED MY STATE OF MIND FOR HE STOLE AWAY SILENTLY LEAVING ME RATHER PENITENT AND ASHAMED
4474-14186-0061 RESUMED HIS VIGIL ON THE DOORSTEP FROM THIS COIGN OF VANTAGE HE RETURNED AFTER A TIME TO TAKE AWAY THE TEA THINGS AND THEREAFTER
