6807-105654-0000 THIS INCIDENT SERVED HENRY AS A PRETENCE FOR HIS SEVERITY
6807-105654-0001 DEEMING HIS THRONE NOW ENTIRELY SECURE PAID HIM RATHER THE GREATER DEFERENCE AND ATTENTION
6807-105654-0002 AND OFFERED TO HOLD HENRY'S STIRRUP A MARK OF CONDESCENSION WHICH THAT PRINCE WOULD NOT ADMIT OF HE CALLED THE KING FATHER PATRON PROTECTOR
6807-105654-0003 AND BY HIS WHOLE BEHAVIOR EXPRESSED A STRONG DESIRE OF CONCILIATING THE FRIENDSHIP OF ENGLAND THE DUKE OF ORLEANS HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE CROWN OF FRANCE
6807-105654-0004 AND SUBDUED THE DUCHY OF MILAN
6807-105654-0005 PHILIP'S FATHER AS WELL AS IN FERDINAND HIS FATHER IN LAW BY THE COUNSEL THEREFORE OF THESE MONARCHS
6807-105654-0006 WHOM THEY REGARDED AS THE CHIEF COUNTERPOISE TO THE GREATNESS OF FRANCE NO PARTICULAR PLAN HOWEVER
6807-105654-0007 ALL PASSED IN GENERAL PROFESSIONS OF AFFECTION AND REGARD AT LEAST IN REMOTE PROJECTS OF A CLOSER UNION BY THE FUTURE INTERMARRIAGES OF THEIR CHILDREN
6807-105654-0008 AND TO LEAD IN PERSON HIS FORCES AGAINST THE INFIDELS THE GENERAL FRENZY FOR CRUSADES WAS NOW ENTIRELY EXHAUSTED IN EUROPE BUT IT WAS STILL THOUGHT A NECESSARY PIECE OF DECENCY TO PRETEND ZEAL FOR THOSE PIOUS ENTERPRISES
6807-105654-0009 WHICH RENDERED IT INCONVENIENT FOR HIM TO EXPOSE HIS PERSON IN DEFENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN CAUSE HE PROMISED HOWEVER
6807-105654-0010 AND RATHER THAN THE POPE SHOULD GO ALONE TO THE HOLY WARS UNACCOMPANIED BY ANY MONARCH HE EVEN PROMISED TO OVERLOOK ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND TO ATTEND HIM IN PERSON HE ONLY REQUIRED AS A NECESSARY CONDITION THAT ALL DIFFERENCES
6807-105654-0011 SHOULD PREVIOUSLY BE ADJUSTED AMONG CHRISTIAN PRINCES AND THAT SOME SEAPORT TOWNS IN ITALY SHOULD BE CONSIGNED TO HIM FOR HIS RETREAT AND SECURITY IT WAS EASY TO CONCLUDE THAT HENRY HAD DETERMINED NOT TO INTERMEDDLE IN ANY WAR AGAINST THE TURK
6807-105654-0012 BUT AS A GREAT NAME WITHOUT ANY REAL ASSISTANCE IS SOMETIMES OF SERVICE THE KNIGHTS OF RHODES WHO WERE AT THAT TIME ESTEEMED THE BULWARK OF CHRISTENDOM CHOSE THE KING PROTECTOR OF THEIR ORDER
6807-105654-0013 THERE WAS ALSO A REMARKABLE SIMILARITY OF CHARACTER BETWEEN THESE TWO PRINCES BOTH WERE FULL OF CRAFT INTRIGUE AND DESIGN AND THOUGH A RESEMBLANCE OF THIS NATURE BE A SLENDER FOUNDATION FOR CONFIDENCE AND AMITY
6807-105654-0014 WHERE THE INTERESTS OF THE PARTIES IN THE LEAST INTERFERE SUCH WAS THE SITUATION OF HENRY AND FERDINAND THAT NO JEALOUSY EVER ON ANY OCCASION AROSE BETWEEN THEM THE KING HAD NOW THE SATISFACTION OF COMPLETING A MARRIAGE
6807-105654-0015 BETWEEN ARTHUR PRINCE OF WALES AND THE INFANTA CATHARINE FOURTH DAUGHTER OF FERDINAND AND ISABELLA HE NEAR SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE SHE EIGHTEEN BUT THIS MARRIAGE PROVED IN THE ISSUE UNPROSPEROUS
6807-105654-0016 THE YOUNG PRINCE A FEW MONTHS AFTER
6807-105654-0017 DESIROUS TO CONTINUE HIS ALLIANCE WITH SPAIN AND ALSO UNWILLING TO RESTORE CATHARINE'S DOWRY WHICH WAS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DUCATS OBLIGED HIS SECOND SON HENRY WHOM HE CREATED PRINCE OF WALES TO BE CONTRACTED TO THE INFANTA
6807-105654-0018 THE PRINCE MADE ALL THE OPPOSITION OF WHICH A YOUTH OF TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WAS CAPABLE BUT AS THE KING PERSISTED IN HIS RESOLUTION THE ESPOUSALS WERE AT LENGTH BY MEANS OF THE POPE'S DISPENSATION
6807-105654-0019 CONTRACTED BETWEEN THE PARTIES AN EVENT WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS ATTENDED WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES THE SAME YEAR ANOTHER MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED WHICH WAS ALSO IN THE NEXT AGE PRODUCTIVE OF GREAT EVENTS
6807-105654-0020 THE MARRIAGE OF MARGARET THE KING'S ELDEST DAUGHTER WITH JAMES KING OF SCOTLAND THIS ALLIANCE HAD BEEN NEGOTIATED DURING THREE YEARS THOUGH INTERRUPTED BY SEVERAL BROILS AND HENRY HOPED
6807-105654-0021 TO REMOVE ALL SOURCE OF DISCORD WITH THAT NEIGHBORING KINGDOM BY WHOSE ANIMOSITY ENGLAND HAD SO OFTEN BEEN INFESTED WHEN THIS MARRIAGE WAS DELIBERATED ON IN THE ENGLISH COUNCIL SOME OBJECTED THAT ENGLAND MIGHT
6807-105654-0022 BY MEANS OF THAT ALLIANCE FALL UNDER THE DOMINION OF SCOTLAND NO REPLIED HENRY SCOTLAND IN THAT EVENT
6807-105654-0023 THESE PROSPEROUS INCIDENTS THE KING MET WITH A DOMESTIC CALAMITY WHICH MADE NOT SUCH IMPRESSION ON HIM AS IT MERITED
6807-105654-0024 AND THE INFANT DID NOT LONG SURVIVE HER THIS PRINCESS WAS DESERVEDLY A FAVORITE OF THE NATION AND THE GENERAL AFFECTION FOR HER INCREASED ON ACCOUNT OF THE HARSH TREATMENT
6807-105654-0025 WHICH IT WAS THOUGHT SHE MET WITH FROM HER CONSORT THE SITUATION OF THE KING'S AFFAIRS BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD
6807-105654-0026 ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE EUROPEAN PRINCES BOTH IN WAR AND NEGOTIATION WERE TURNED TO THE SIDE OF ITALY
6807-105654-0027 YET INTERESTED HIM SO LITTLE AS NEVER TO TOUCH HIM WITH CONCERN OR ANXIETY HIS CLOSE CONNECTIONS WITH SPAIN AND SCOTLAND
6807-105654-0028 AND HIS CONTINUED SUCCESSES OVER DOMESTIC ENEMIES
6807-105654-0029 HAD REDUCED THE PEOPLE TO ENTIRE SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE UNCONTROLLED THEREFORE BY APPREHENSION OR OPPOSITION OF ANY KIND HE GAVE FULL SCOPE TO HIS NATURAL PROPENSITY
6807-105654-0030 PERFECTLY QUALIFIED TO SECOND HIS RAPACIOUS AND TYRANNICAL INCLINATIONS AND TO PREY UPON HIS DEFENCELESS PEOPLE THESE INSTRUMENTS OF OPPRESSION WERE BOTH LAWYERS THE FIRST OF MEAN BIRTH OF BRUTAL MANNERS
6807-105654-0031 OF AN UNRELENTING TEMPER THE SECOND BETTER BORN BETTER EDUCATED AND BETTER BRED BUT EQUALLY UNJUST SEVERE AND INFLEXIBLE BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN LAW THESE MEN WERE QUALIFIED TO PERVERT THE FORMS OF JUSTICE
6807-105654-0032 TO THE OPPRESSION OF THE INNOCENT AND THE FORMIDABLE AUTHORITY OF THE KING SUPPORTED THEM IN ALL THEIR INIQUITIES IT WAS THEIR USUAL PRACTICE AT FIRST
6807-105654-0033 TO OBSERVE SO FAR THE APPEARANCE OF LAW AS TO GIVE INDICTMENTS TO THOSE WHOM THEY INTENDED TO OPPRESS UPON WHICH THE PERSONS WERE COMMITTED TO PRISON BUT NEVER BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND WERE AT LENGTH OBLIGED IN ORDER TO RECOVER THEIR LIBERTY
6807-105654-0034 TO PAY HEAVY FINES AND RANSOMS WHICH WERE CALLED MITIGATIONS AND COMPOSITIONS BY DEGREES THE VERY APPEARANCE OF LAW WAS NEGLECTED
6807-105654-0035 BEING BROWBEATEN BY THESE OPPRESSORS NAY FINED IMPRISONED AND PUNISHED IF THEY GAVE SENTENCE AGAINST THE INCLINATION OF THE MINISTERS THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF THE FEUDAL LAW WHICH STILL PREVAILED WAS TURNED
6807-105654-0036 EVEN THE KING'S WARDS AFTER THEY CAME OF AGE WERE NOT SUFFERED TO ENTER INTO POSSESSION OF THEIR LANDS WITHOUT PAYING EXORBITANT FINES MEN WERE ALSO HARASSED WITH INFORMATIONS OF INTRUSION UPON SCARCE COLORABLE TITLES
6807-105654-0037 WHEN AN OUTLAWRY IN A PERSONAL ACTION WAS ISSUED AGAINST ANY MAN HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PURCHASE HIS CHARTER OF PARDON EXCEPT ON THE PAYMENT OF A GREAT SUM AND IF HE REFUSED THE COMPOSITION REQUIRED OF HIM
6807-105654-0038 THE STRICT LAW WHICH IN SUCH CASES ALLOWS FORFEITURE OF GOODS WAS RIGOROUSLY INSISTED ON NAY
6807-105654-0039 THE HALF OF MEN'S LANDS AND RENTS WERE SEIZED DURING TWO YEARS AS A PENALTY IN CASE OF OUTLAWRY BUT THE CHIEF MEANS OF OPPRESSION EMPLOYED BY THESE MINISTERS
6807-105654-0040 WHICH WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF RANK QUALITY OR SERVICES
6807-105654-0041 RIGIDLY PUT IN EXECUTION AGAINST ALL MEN SPIES INFORMERS AND INQUISITORS WERE REWARDED AND ENCOURAGED IN EVERY QUARTER OF THE KINGDOM AND NO DIFFERENCE WAS MADE WHETHER THE STATUTE WERE BENEFICIAL OR HURTFUL
6807-105654-0042 RECENT OR OBSOLETE POSSIBLE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO BE EXECUTED THE SOLE END OF THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS WAS TO AMASS MONEY AND BRING EVERY ONE UNDER THE LASH OF THEIR AUTHORITY
6807-105654-0043 THROUGH THE PREVALENCE OF SUCH AN ARBITRARY AND INIQUITOUS ADMINISTRATION THE ENGLISH IT MAY SAFELY BE AFFIRMED
6807-105654-0044 HAD THE KING BEEN EMPOWERED TO LEVY GENERAL TAXES AT PLEASURE HE WOULD NATURALLY HAVE ABSTAINED FROM THESE OPPRESSIVE EXPEDIENTS WHICH DESTROYED ALL SECURITY IN PRIVATE PROPERTY
6807-105654-0045 AND BEGAT A UNIVERSAL DIFFIDENCE THROUGHOUT THE NATION IN VAIN
6807-105654-0046 WAS SO OVERAWED THAT AT THIS VERY TIME
6807-105654-0047 THE COMMONS CHOSE DUDLEY THEIR SPEAKER THE VERY MAN WHO WAS THE CHIEF INSTRUMENT OF HIS INIQUITIES AND THOUGH THE KING WAS KNOWN TO BE IMMENSELY OPULENT
6807-105654-0048 WHICH ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION AND WAS EVEN THE OBJECT OF HIS ANXIETY AND CONCERN ISABELLA
6807-105654-0049 DIED ABOUT THIS TIME AND IT WAS FORESEEN THAT BY THIS INCIDENT
6807-105654-0050 HER HUSBAND WOULD BE MUCH AFFECTED THE KING WAS NOT ONLY ATTENTIVE TO THE FATE OF HIS ALLY AND WATCHFUL LEST
6807-105654-0051 HE ALSO CONSIDERED THE SIMILARITY OF HIS OWN SITUATION WITH THAT OF FERDINAND AND REGARDED THE ISSUE OF THESE TRANSACTIONS AS A PRECEDENT FOR HIMSELF JOAN THE DAUGHTER OF FERDINAND BY ISABELLA
6807-105654-0052 AND BEING IN RIGHT OF HER MOTHER
6807-105654-0053 SEEMED ENTITLED TO DISPUTE WITH FERDINAND THE PRESENT POSSESSION OF THAT KINGDOM HENRY KNEW THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS OWN PRETENSIONS BY THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER
6807-105654-0054 THE GREATER PART OF THE NATION WAS CONVINCED OF THE SUPERIORITY OF HIS WIFE'S TITLE
6807-105654-0055 MIGHT BE TEMPTED BY AMBITION TO LAY IMMEDIATE CLAIM TO THE CROWN BY HIS PERPETUAL ATTENTION TO DEPRESS THE PARTISANS OF THE YORK FAMILY
6807-105654-0056 AND OF TAKING EVERY ADVANTAGE WHICH HIS OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GIVE HIS ENEMIES AGAINST HIM AND
6807-105654-0057 AND GOVERNED A KINGDOM MORE TURBULENT AND UNRULY
6807-105654-0058 THAN THE TRANSACTIONS IN SPAIN FERDINAND AS WELL AS HENRY HAD BECOME VERY UNPOPULAR AND FROM A LIKE CAUSE HIS FORMER EXACTIONS AND IMPOSITIONS

6807-105654-0062 TO INFORM THE COURT OF THIS IMPORTANT INCIDENT THE KING SENT IN ALL HASTE THE EARL OF ARUNDEL TO COMPLIMENT PHILIP ON HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND AND TO INFORM HIM THAT HE INTENDED TO PAY HIM A VISIT IN PERSON
6807-105654-0063 AND TO GIVE HIM A SUITABLE RECEPTION IN HIS DOMINIONS PHILIP KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT NOW DEPART WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT AND THEREFORE FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH
6807-105654-0064 AND TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM AT WINDSOR HENRY RECEIVED HIM WITH ALL THE MAGNIFICENCE POSSIBLE AND WITH ALL THE SEEMING CORDIALITY BUT HE RESOLVED NOTWITHSTANDING
