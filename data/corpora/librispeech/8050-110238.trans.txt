8050-110238-0000 SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE OUR BREAKFAST TABLE WAS CLEARED EARLY AND HOLMES WAITED IN HIS DRESSING GOWN FOR THE PROMISED INTERVIEW
8050-110238-0001 OUR CLIENTS WERE PUNCTUAL TO THEIR APPOINTMENT FOR THE CLOCK HAD JUST STRUCK TEN WHEN DOCTOR MORTIMER WAS SHOWN UP FOLLOWED BY THE YOUNG BARONET THE LATTER WAS A SMALL ALERT
8050-110238-0002 DARK EYED MAN ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE VERY STURDILY BUILT WITH THICK BLACK EYEBROWS AND A STRONG PUGNACIOUS FACE HE WORE A RUDDY TINTED TWEED SUIT
8050-110238-0003 AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS STEADY EYE AND THE QUIET ASSURANCE OF HIS BEARING WHICH INDICATED THE GENTLEMAN THIS IS SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE SAID DOCTOR MORTIMER WHY YES SAID HE
8050-110238-0004 AND THE STRANGE THING IS MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES THAT IF MY FRIEND HERE HAD NOT PROPOSED COMING ROUND TO YOU THIS MORNING I SHOULD HAVE COME ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
8050-110238-0005 PRAY TAKE A SEAT SIR HENRY
8050-110238-0006 ONLY A JOKE AS LIKE AS NOT IT WAS THIS LETTER IF YOU CAN CALL IT A LETTER WHICH REACHED ME THIS MORNING HE LAID AN ENVELOPE UPON THE TABLE AND WE ALL BENT OVER IT
8050-110238-0007 THE ADDRESS SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL WAS PRINTED IN ROUGH CHARACTERS THE POST MARK CHARING CROSS AND THE DATE OF POSTING THE PRECEDING EVENING
8050-110238-0008 NO ONE COULD HAVE KNOWN WE ONLY DECIDED AFTER I MET DOCTOR MORTIMER BUT DOCTOR MORTIMER
8050-110238-0009 THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE INDICATION THAT WE INTENDED TO GO TO THIS HOTEL HUM SOMEONE SEEMS TO BE VERY DEEPLY INTERESTED IN YOUR MOVEMENTS
8050-110238-0010 OUT OF THE ENVELOPE HE TOOK A HALF SHEET OF FOOLSCAP PAPER FOLDED INTO FOUR THIS HE OPENED AND SPREAD FLAT UPON THE TABLE
8050-110238-0011 ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF IT A SINGLE SENTENCE HAD BEEN FORMED BY THE EXPEDIENT OF PASTING PRINTED WORDS UPON IT IT RAN AS YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE OR YOUR REASON KEEP AWAY FROM THE MOOR
8050-110238-0012 WAS PRINTED IN INK NOW SAID SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE PERHAPS YOU WILL TELL ME MISTER HOLMES WHAT IN THUNDER IS THE MEANING OF THAT AND WHO IT IS THAT TAKES SO MUCH INTEREST IN MY AFFAIRS
8050-110238-0013 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT DOCTOR MORTIMER YOU MUST ALLOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL ABOUT THIS AT ANY RATE
8050-110238-0014 NO SIR BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL COME FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS CONVINCED THAT THE BUSINESS IS SUPERNATURAL WHAT BUSINESS ASKED SIR HENRY SHARPLY
8050-110238-0015 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL YOU GENTLEMEN KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN I DO ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS YOU SHALL SHARE OUR KNOWLEDGE BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM SIR HENRY I PROMISE YOU THAT SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
8050-110238-0016 WE WILL CONFINE OURSELVES FOR THE PRESENT WITH YOUR PERMISSION TO THIS VERY INTERESTING DOCUMENT WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER AND POSTED YESTERDAY EVENING HAVE YOU YESTERDAY'S TIMES WATSON
8050-110238-0017 MIGHT I TROUBLE YOU FOR IT THE INSIDE PAGE PLEASE WITH THE LEADING ARTICLES HE GLANCED SWIFTLY OVER IT RUNNING HIS EYES UP AND DOWN THE COLUMNS CAPITAL ARTICLE THIS ON FREE TRADE PERMIT ME TO GIVE YOU AN EXTRACT FROM IT
8050-110238-0018 BUT IT STANDS TO REASON THAT SUCH LEGISLATION MUST IN THE LONG RUN KEEP AWAY WEALTH FROM THE COUNTRY DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR IMPORTS AND LOWER THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE IN THIS ISLAND
8050-110238-0019 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT WATSON CRIED HOLMES IN HIGH GLEE RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER WITH SATISFACTION DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS AN ADMIRABLE SENTIMENT
8050-110238-0020 DOCTOR MORTIMER LOOKED AT HOLMES WITH AN AIR OF PROFESSIONAL INTEREST AND SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE TURNED A PAIR OF PUZZLED DARK EYES UPON ME I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE TARIFF AND THINGS OF THAT KIND SAID HE
8050-110238-0021 BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WE'VE GOT A BIT OFF THE TRAIL SO FAR AS THAT NOTE IS CONCERNED ON THE CONTRARY I THINK WE ARE PARTICULARLY HOT UPON THE TRAIL SIR HENRY WATSON HERE KNOWS MORE ABOUT MY METHODS THAN YOU DO
8050-110238-0022 BUT I FEAR THAT EVEN HE HAS NOT QUITE GRASPED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS SENTENCE NO I CONFESS THAT I SEE NO CONNECTION AND YET MY DEAR WATSON
8050-110238-0023 THERE IS SO VERY CLOSE A CONNECTION THAT THE ONE IS EXTRACTED OUT OF THE OTHER YOU YOUR YOUR LIFE REASON VALUE KEEP AWAY FROM THE DON'T YOU SEE NOW WHENCE THESE WORDS HAVE BEEN TAKEN
8050-110238-0024 IF ANY POSSIBLE DOUBT REMAINED IT IS SETTLED BY THE FACT THAT KEEP AWAY AND FROM THE ARE CUT OUT IN ONE PIECE WELL NOW SO IT IS
8050-110238-0025 REALLY MISTER HOLMES THIS EXCEEDS ANYTHING WHICH I COULD HAVE IMAGINED SAID DOCTOR MORTIMER GAZING AT MY FRIEND IN AMAZEMENT I COULD UNDERSTAND ANYONE SAYING THAT THE WORDS WERE FROM A NEWSPAPER
8050-110238-0026 BUT THAT YOU SHOULD NAME WHICH AND ADD THAT IT CAME FROM THE LEADING ARTICLE IS REALLY ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS WHICH I HAVE EVER KNOWN HOW DID YOU DO IT
8050-110238-0027 THE DIFFERENCES ARE OBVIOUS THE SUPRA ORBITAL CREST THE FACIAL ANGLE THE MAXILLARY CURVE THE BUT THIS IS MY SPECIAL HOBBY AND THE DIFFERENCES ARE EQUALLY OBVIOUS THERE IS AS MUCH DIFFERENCE TO MY EYES BETWEEN THE LEADED BOURGEOIS
8050-110238-0028 TYPE OF A TIMES ARTICLE AND THE SLOVENLY PRINT OF AN EVENING HALF PENNY PAPER AS THERE COULD BE BETWEEN YOUR NEGRO AND YOUR ESQUIMAU THE DETECTION OF TYPES IS ONE OF THE MOST ELEMENTARY BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE TO THE SPECIAL EXPERT IN CRIME
8050-110238-0029 THOUGH I CONFESS THAT ONCE WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG I CONFUSED THE LEEDS MERCURY WITH THE WESTERN MORNING NEWS BUT A TIMES LEADER IS ENTIRELY DISTINCTIVE
8050-110238-0030 AS IT WAS DONE YESTERDAY THE STRONG PROBABILITY WAS THAT WE SHOULD FIND THE WORDS IN YESTERDAY'S ISSUE SO FAR AS I CAN FOLLOW YOU THEN MISTER HOLMES SAID SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE
8050-110238-0031 SOMEONE CUT OUT THIS MESSAGE WITH A SCISSORS NAIL SCISSORS SAID HOLMES YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WAS A VERY SHORT BLADED SCISSORS SINCE THE CUTTER HAD TO TAKE TWO SNIPS OVER KEEP AWAY THAT
8050-110238-0032 IS SO SOMEONE THEN CUT OUT THE MESSAGE WITH A PAIR OF SHORT BLADED SCISSORS PASTED IT WITH PASTE GUM SAID HOLMES
8050-110238-0033 BECAUSE HE COULD NOT FIND IT IN PRINT
8050-110238-0034 WHY OF COURSE THAT WOULD EXPLAIN IT HAVE YOU READ ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS MESSAGE MISTER HOLMES THERE ARE ONE OR TWO INDICATIONS AND YET THE UTMOST PAINS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO REMOVE ALL CLUES
8050-110238-0035 THE ADDRESS YOU OBSERVE IS PRINTED IN ROUGH CHARACTERS BUT THE TIMES IS A PAPER WHICH IS SELDOM FOUND IN ANY HANDS BUT THOSE OF THE HIGHLY EDUCATED WE MAY TAKE IT THEREFORE THAT THE LETTER WAS COMPOSED BY AN EDUCATED MAN WHO WISHED TO POSE AS AN UNEDUCATED ONE
8050-110238-0036 AND HIS EFFORT TO CONCEAL HIS OWN WRITING SUGGESTS THAT THAT WRITING MIGHT BE KNOWN OR COME TO BE KNOWN BY YOU AGAIN YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THE WORDS ARE NOT GUMMED ON IN AN ACCURATE LINE
8050-110238-0037 LIFE FOR EXAMPLE IS QUITE OUT OF ITS PROPER PLACE THAT MAY POINT TO CARELESSNESS OR IT MAY POINT TO AGITATION AND HURRY UPON THE PART OF THE CUTTER ON THE WHOLE I INCLINE TO THE LATTER VIEW SINCE THE MATTER WAS EVIDENTLY IMPORTANT
8050-110238-0038 AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE COMPOSER OF SUCH A LETTER WOULD BE CARELESS IF HE WERE IN A HURRY IT OPENS UP THE INTERESTING QUESTION WHY HE SHOULD BE IN A HURRY
8050-110238-0039 DID THE COMPOSER FEAR AN INTERRUPTION AND FROM WHOM WE ARE COMING NOW RATHER INTO THE REGION OF GUESSWORK SAID DOCTOR MORTIMER
8050-110238-0040 AND CHOOSE THE MOST LIKELY IT IS THE SCIENTIFIC USE OF THE IMAGINATION BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS SOME MATERIAL BASIS ON WHICH TO START OUR SPECULATION NOW YOU WOULD CALL IT A GUESS NO DOUBT BUT I AM ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THIS ADDRESS HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN A HOTEL
8050-110238-0041 CAN YOU SAY THAT IF YOU EXAMINE IT CAREFULLY YOU WILL SEE THAT BOTH THE PEN AND THE INK HAVE GIVEN THE WRITER TROUBLE THE PEN HAS SPLUTTERED TWICE IN A SINGLE WORD AND HAS RUN DRY THREE TIMES IN A SHORT ADDRESS
8050-110238-0042 SHOWING THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE INK IN THE BOTTLE NOW A PRIVATE PEN OR INK BOTTLE IS SELDOM ALLOWED TO BE IN SUCH A STATE AND THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO MUST BE QUITE RARE
8050-110238-0043 BUT YOU KNOW THE HOTEL INK AND THE HOTEL PEN WHERE IT IS RARE TO GET ANYTHING ELSE YES I HAVE VERY LITTLE HESITATION IN SAYING THAT COULD WE EXAMINE THE WASTE PAPER BASKETS OF THE HOTELS AROUND CHARING CROSS
8050-110238-0044 UNTIL WE FOUND THE REMAINS OF THE MUTILATED TIMES LEADER WE COULD LAY OUR HANDS STRAIGHT UPON THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS SINGULAR MESSAGE HALLOA HALLOA WHAT'S THIS
8050-110238-0045 NOTHING SAID HE THROWING IT DOWN IT IS A BLANK HALF SHEET OF PAPER WITHOUT EVEN A WATER MARK UPON IT I THINK WE HAVE DRAWN AS MUCH AS WE CAN FROM THIS CURIOUS LETTER AND NOW SIR HENRY
8050-110238-0046 HAS ANYTHING ELSE OF INTEREST HAPPENED TO YOU SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN IN LONDON WHY
8050-110238-0047 I THINK NOT YOU HAVE NOT OBSERVED ANYONE FOLLOW OR WATCH YOU
8050-110238-0048 WHY IN THUNDER SHOULD ANYONE FOLLOW OR WATCH ME WE ARE COMING TO THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO REPORT TO US BEFORE WE GO INTO THIS MATTER
8050-110238-0049 DEPENDS UPON WHAT YOU THINK WORTH REPORTING I THINK ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY ROUTINE OF LIFE WELL WORTH REPORTING SIR HENRY SMILED
8050-110238-0050 I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF BRITISH LIFE YET FOR I HAVE SPENT NEARLY ALL MY TIME IN THE STATES AND IN CANADA BUT I HOPE THAT TO LOSE ONE OF YOUR BOOTS IS NOT PART OF THE ORDINARY ROUTINE OF LIFE OVER HERE
8050-110238-0051 YOU HAVE LOST ONE OF YOUR BOOTS MY DEAR SIR CRIED DOCTOR MORTIMER IT IS ONLY MISLAID YOU WILL FIND IT WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE HOTEL WHAT IS THE USE OF TROUBLING MISTER HOLMES WITH TRIFLES OF
8050-110238-0052 THIS KIND WELL HE ASKED ME FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY ROUTINE EXACTLY SAID HOLMES HOWEVER FOOLISH THE INCIDENT MAY SEEM YOU HAVE LOST ONE OF YOUR BOOTS YOU SAY
8050-110238-0053 WELL MISLAID IT ANYHOW I PUT THEM BOTH OUTSIDE MY DOOR LAST NIGHT AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE IN THE MORNING I COULD GET NO SENSE OUT OF THE CHAP WHO CLEANS THEM THE WORST OF IT IS THAT I
8050-110238-0054 ONLY BOUGHT THE PAIR LAST NIGHT IN THE STRAND AND I HAVE NEVER HAD THEM ON IF YOU HAVE NEVER WORN THEM WHY DID YOU PUT THEM OUT TO BE CLEANED
8050-110238-0055 THAT WAS WHY I PUT THEM OUT THEN I UNDERSTAND THAT ON YOUR ARRIVAL IN LONDON YESTERDAY YOU WENT OUT AT ONCE AND BOUGHT A PAIR OF BOOTS I DID A GOOD DEAL OF SHOPPING DOCTOR MORTIMER HERE WENT ROUND WITH ME
8050-110238-0056 YOU SEE IF I AM TO BE SQUIRE DOWN THERE I MUST DRESS THE PART AND IT MAY BE THAT I HAVE GOT A LITTLE CARELESS IN MY WAYS OUT WEST
8050-110238-0057 AMONG OTHER THINGS I BOUGHT THESE BROWN BOOTS GAVE SIX DOLLARS FOR THEM AND HAD ONE STOLEN BEFORE EVER I HAD THEM ON MY FEET IT SEEMS A SINGULARLY USELESS THING TO STEAL SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
8050-110238-0058 I CONFESS THAT I SHARE DOCTOR MORTIMER'S BELIEF THAT IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE THE MISSING BOOT IS FOUND AND NOW GENTLEMEN SAID THE BARONET WITH DECISION
8050-110238-0059 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I HAVE SPOKEN QUITE ENOUGH ABOUT THE LITTLE THAT I KNOW IT IS TIME THAT YOU KEPT YOUR PROMISE AND GAVE ME A FULL ACCOUNT OF WHAT WE ARE ALL DRIVING AT
8050-110238-0060 YOUR REQUEST IS A VERY REASONABLE ONE HOLMES ANSWERED DOCTOR MORTIMER I THINK YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN TO TELL YOUR STORY AS YOU TOLD IT TO US THUS ENCOURAGED OUR SCIENTIFIC FRIEND
8050-110238-0061 DREW HIS PAPERS FROM HIS POCKET AND PRESENTED THE WHOLE CASE AS HE HAD DONE UPON THE MORNING BEFORE SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE LISTENED WITH THE DEEPEST ATTENTION AND WITH AN OCCASIONAL EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE
8050-110238-0062 SAID HE WHEN THE LONG NARRATIVE WAS FINISHED OF COURSE I'VE HEARD OF THE HOUND EVER SINCE I WAS IN THE NURSERY IT'S THE PET STORY OF THE FAMILY THOUGH I NEVER THOUGHT OF TAKING IT SERIOUSLY BEFORE BUT
8050-110238-0063 AS TO MY UNCLE'S DEATH WELL IT ALL SEEMS BOILING UP IN MY HEAD AND I CAN'T GET IT CLEAR YET YOU DON'T SEEM QUITE TO HAVE MADE UP YOUR MIND WHETHER IT'S A CASE FOR A POLICEMAN OR A CLERGYMAN PRECISELY
8050-110238-0064 AND NOW THERE'S THIS AFFAIR OF THE LETTER TO ME AT THE HOTEL I SUPPOSE THAT FITS INTO ITS PLACE
8050-110238-0065 SAID DOCTOR MORTIMER AND ALSO SAID HOLMES THAT SOMEONE IS NOT ILL DISPOSED TOWARDS YOU SINCE THEY WARN YOU OF DANGER OR IT MAY BE THAT THEY WISH FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES TO SCARE ME AWAY
8050-110238-0066 WELL OF COURSE THAT IS POSSIBLE ALSO I AM VERY MUCH INDEBTED TO YOU DOCTOR MORTIMER FOR INTRODUCING ME TO A PROBLEM WHICH PRESENTS SEVERAL INTERESTING ALTERNATIVES
8050-110238-0067 BUT THE PRACTICAL POINT WHICH WE NOW HAVE TO DECIDE SIR HENRY IS WHETHER IT IS OR IS NOT ADVISABLE FOR YOU TO GO TO BASKERVILLE HALL
8050-110238-0068 THERE SEEMS TO BE DANGER
8050-110238-0069 WELL THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHICHEVER IT IS MY ANSWER IS FIXED
8050-110238-0070 AND YOU MAY TAKE THAT TO BE MY FINAL ANSWER HIS DARK BROWS KNITTED AND HIS FACE FLUSHED TO A DUSKY RED AS HE SPOKE
8050-110238-0071 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE FIERY TEMPER OF THE BASKERVILLES WAS NOT EXTINCT IN THIS THEIR LAST REPRESENTATIVE MEANWHILE SAID HE I HAVE HARDLY HAD TIME TO THINK OVER ALL THAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME
8050-110238-0072 IT'S A BIG THING FOR A MAN TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND TO DECIDE AT ONE SITTING I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A QUIET HOUR BY MYSELF TO MAKE UP MY MIND NOW LOOK HERE MISTER HOLMES IT'S HALF PAST ELEVEN NOW
8050-110238-0073 SUPPOSE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND DOCTOR WATSON COME ROUND AND LUNCH WITH US AT TWO I'LL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU MORE CLEARLY THEN HOW THIS THING STRIKES ME
8050-110238-0074 PERFECTLY
8050-110238-0075 I'D PREFER TO WALK FOR THIS AFFAIR HAS FLURRIED ME RATHER I'LL JOIN YOU IN A WALK WITH PLEASURE SAID HIS COMPANION THEN WE MEET AGAIN AT TWO O'CLOCK AU REVOIR AND GOOD MORNING
8050-110238-0076 AND THE BANG OF THE FRONT DOOR IN AN INSTANT HOLMES HAD CHANGED FROM THE LANGUID DREAMER TO THE MAN OF ACTION YOUR HAT AND BOOTS WATSON QUICK NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE HE RUSHED INTO HIS ROOM IN HIS DRESSING GOWN AND WAS BACK AGAIN IN A FEW SECONDS IN A FROCK COAT
8050-110238-0077 WE HURRIED TOGETHER DOWN THE STAIRS AND INTO THE STREET DOCTOR MORTIMER AND BASKERVILLE WERE STILL VISIBLE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD OF US IN THE DIRECTION OF OXFORD STREET SHALL I RUN ON AND STOP THEM
8050-110238-0078 NOT FOR THE WORLD MY DEAR WATSON I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH YOUR COMPANY IF YOU WILL TOLERATE MINE OUR FRIENDS ARE WISE FOR IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY FINE MORNING FOR A WALK
8050-110238-0079 HE QUICKENED HIS PACE UNTIL WE HAD DECREASED THE DISTANCE WHICH DIVIDED US BY ABOUT HALF THEN STILL KEEPING A HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND WE FOLLOWED INTO OXFORD STREET
8050-110238-0080 ONCE OUR FRIENDS STOPPED AND STARED INTO A SHOP WINDOW UPON WHICH HOLMES DID THE SAME AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS HE GAVE A LITTLE CRY OF SATISFACTION AND
8050-110238-0081 FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF HIS EAGER EYES I SAW THAT A HANSOM CAB WITH A MAN INSIDE WHICH HAD HALTED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET WAS NOW PROCEEDING SLOWLY ONWARD AGAIN THERE'S OUR MAN WATSON
8050-110238-0082 COME ALONG WE'LL HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT HIM IF WE CAN DO NO MORE AT THAT INSTANT I WAS AWARE OF A BUSHY BLACK BEARD AND A PAIR OF PIERCING EYES TURNED UPON US THROUGH THE SIDE WINDOW OF THE CAB
8050-110238-0083 AND THE CAB FLEW MADLY OFF DOWN REGENT STREET HOLMES LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND FOR ANOTHER BUT NO EMPTY ONE WAS IN SIGHT
8050-110238-0084 BUT THE START WAS TOO GREAT AND ALREADY THE CAB WAS OUT OF SIGHT THERE NOW SAID HOLMES BITTERLY AS HE EMERGED PANTING AND WHITE WITH VEXATION FROM THE TIDE OF VEHICLES
8050-110238-0085 WAS EVER SUCH BAD LUCK AND SUCH BAD MANAGEMENT TOO WATSON
8050-110238-0086 WHO WAS THE MAN I HAVE NOT AN IDEA A SPY
8050-110238-0087 SINCE HE HAS BEEN IN TOWN HOW ELSE COULD IT BE KNOWN SO QUICKLY THAT IT WAS THE NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL WHICH HE HAD CHOSEN
8050-110238-0088 YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED THAT I TWICE STROLLED OVER TO THE WINDOW WHILE DOCTOR MORTIMER WAS READING HIS LEGEND YES I REMEMBER I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR LOITERERS IN THE STREET BUT I SAW NONE
8050-110238-0089 WE ARE DEALING WITH A CLEVER MAN WATSON THIS MATTER CUTS VERY DEEP AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT FINALLY MADE UP MY MIND WHETHER IT IS A BENEVOLENT OR A MALEVOLENT AGENCY WHICH IS IN TOUCH WITH US I AM CONSCIOUS ALWAYS OF POWER AND DESIGN
8050-110238-0090 WHEN OUR FRIENDS LEFT I AT ONCE FOLLOWED THEM IN THE HOPES OF MARKING DOWN THEIR INVISIBLE ATTENDANT SO WILY WAS HE THAT HE HAD NOT TRUSTED HIMSELF UPON FOOT
8050-110238-0091 BUT HE HAD AVAILED HIMSELF OF A CAB SO THAT HE COULD LOITER BEHIND OR DASH PAST THEM AND SO ESCAPE THEIR NOTICE HIS METHOD HAD THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE THAT IF THEY WERE TO TAKE A CAB HE WAS ALL READY TO FOLLOW THEM
8050-110238-0092 IT HAS HOWEVER ONE OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE IT PUTS HIM IN THE POWER OF THE CABMAN EXACTLY WHAT A PITY WE DID NOT GET THE NUMBER
8050-110238-0093 MY DEAR WATSON CLUMSY AS I HAVE BEEN YOU SURELY DO NOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE THAT I NEGLECTED TO GET THE NUMBER
8050-110238-0094 BUT THAT IS NO USE TO US FOR THE MOMENT
8050-110238-0095 ON OBSERVING THE CAB I SHOULD HAVE INSTANTLY TURNED AND WALKED IN THE OTHER DIRECTION I SHOULD THEN AT MY LEISURE HAVE HIRED A SECOND CAB AND FOLLOWED THE FIRST AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE
8050-110238-0096 OR BETTER STILL HAVE DRIVEN TO THE NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL AND WAITED THERE WHEN OUR UNKNOWN HAD FOLLOWED BASKERVILLE HOME WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF PLAYING HIS OWN GAME UPON HIMSELF AND SEEING WHERE HE MADE FOR
8050-110238-0097 AS IT IS BY AN INDISCREET EAGERNESS WHICH WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WITH EXTRAORDINARY QUICKNESS AND ENERGY BY OUR OPPONENT WE HAVE BETRAYED OURSELVES AND LOST OUR MAN
8050-110238-0098 WE HAD BEEN SAUNTERING SLOWLY DOWN REGENT STREET DURING THIS CONVERSATION AND DOCTOR MORTIMER WITH HIS COMPANION HAD LONG VANISHED IN FRONT OF US
8050-110238-0099 THE SHADOW HAS DEPARTED AND WILL NOT RETURN WE MUST SEE WHAT FURTHER CARDS WE HAVE IN OUR HANDS AND PLAY THEM WITH DECISION COULD YOU SWEAR TO THAT MAN'S FACE WITHIN THE CAB I COULD SWEAR ONLY TO THE BEARD
8050-110238-0100 AND SO COULD I FROM WHICH I GATHER THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY IT WAS A FALSE ONE A CLEVER MAN UPON SO DELICATE AN ERRAND HAS NO USE FOR A BEARD SAVE TO CONCEAL HIS FEATURES COME IN HERE WATSON
8050-110238-0101 HE TURNED INTO ONE OF THE DISTRICT MESSENGER OFFICES WHERE HE WAS WARMLY GREETED BY THE MANAGER AH WILSON I SEE YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE LITTLE CASE IN WHICH I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO HELP YOU NO SIR
