7467-69610-0000 WHEN MISS LE BRETON REACHED THE HALL A FOOTMAN WAS AT THE OUTER DOOR RECITING LADY HENRY'S EXCUSES AS EACH FRESH CARRIAGE DROVE UP WHILE IN THE INNER VESTIBULE WHICH WAS WELL SCREENED FROM THE VIEW OF THE STREET

7467-69610-0003 MISTER DELAFIELD DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE BEST WILL YOU TELL HUTTON NOT TO LET IN ANYBODY ELSE SHE LOOKED AT HIM UNCERTAINLY AS THOUGH APPEALING TO HIM AS A RELATION OF LADY HENRY'S TO TAKE THE LEAD BY ALL MEANS
7467-69610-0004 SAID THAT YOUNG MAN AFTER PERHAPS A MOMENT'S HESITATION AND THROWING OFF HIS COAT ONLY PLEASE MAKE NO NOISE SAID MISS LE BRETON TURNING TO THE GROUP LADY HENRY MIGHT BE DISTURBED
7467-69610-0005 EVERY ONE CAME IN AS IT WERE ON TIPTOE IN EACH FACE A SENSE OF THE HUMOR OF THE SITUATION FOUGHT WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS DANGERS AS SOON AS MONTRESOR SAW THE LITTLE DUCHESS BY THE FIRE
7467-69610-0006 HE THREW UP HIS HANDS IN RELIEF I BREATHE AGAIN HE SAID GREETING HER WITH EFFUSION DUCHESS WHERE THOU GOEST I MAY GO BUT I FEEL LIKE A BOY ROBBING A HEN ROOST LET ME INTRODUCE MY FRIEND GENERAL FERGUS
7467-69610-0007 ON THE CONTRARY SAID THE DUCHESS AS SHE RETURNED GENERAL FERGUS'S BOW
7467-69610-0008 FOR THEY WERE BOTH IN UNIFORM AND THE GENERAL WAS RESPLENDENT WITH STARS AND MEDALS
7467-69610-0009 SAID MONTRESOR WE WANT SOME RELAXATION HE PUT ON HIS EYE GLASSES LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM AND GENTLY RUBBED HIS HANDS HOW VERY AGREEABLE THIS IS WHAT A CHARMING ROOM
7467-69610-0010 IS IT A PARTY WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE MEREDITH
7467-69610-0011 AH I SEE FOR JULIE LE BRETON WAS ALREADY CONVERSING WITH THE DISTINGUISHED FRENCHMAN
7467-69610-0012 SHE CAME FORWARD AND IN A FRENCH WHICH WAS A JOY TO THE EAR
7467-69610-0013 AND JACOB THE DIRECTOR OF THE FRENCH FOREIGN OFFICE SAID MONTRESOR IN AN ASIDE TO THE DUCHESS
7467-69610-0014 MEANWHILE THE FRENCHMAN HIS INTRODUCTIONS OVER LOOKED CURIOUSLY ROUND THE ROOM STUDIED ITS STATELY EMPTINESS THE BOOKS ON THE WALLS UNDER A TRELLIS WORK FAINTLY GILT THE THREE FINE PICTURES
7467-69610-0015 THESE ENGLISHWOMEN OVERDO THEIR JEWELS HE THOUGHT WITH DISTASTE BUT THEY OVERDO EVERYTHING THAT IS A HANDSOME FELLOW BY THE WAY WHO WAS WITH LA PETITE FEE WHEN WE ARRIVED
7467-69610-0016 AND HIS SHREWD SMALL EYES TRAVELLED FROM WARKWORTH TO THE DUCHESS HIS MIND THE WHILE INSTINCTIVELY ASSUMING SOME HIDDEN RELATION BETWEEN THEM
7467-69610-0017 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR TWENTY YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT FOUND HER ON A WEDNESDAY EVENING HE SAID WITH A SUDDEN TOUCH OF FEELING WHICH BECAME HIM AT OUR AGE THE SMALLEST BREAK IN THE OLD HABIT HE SIGHED
7467-69610-0018 AND THEN QUICKLY THREW OFF HIS DEPRESSION NONSENSE NEXT WEEK SHE WILL BE SCOLDING US ALL WITH DOUBLE ENERGY MEANWHILE MAY WE SIT DOWN MADEMOISELLE TEN MINUTES
7467-69610-0019 AND UPON MY WORD THE VERY THING MY SOUL WAS LONGING FOR A CUP OF COFFEE
7467-69610-0020 ENTERED WITH TRAYS CONTAINING TEA AND COFFEE LEMONADE AND CAKES SHUT THE DOOR HUTTON PLEASE MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON IMPLORED AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT AT ONCE WE MUSTN'T MUSTN'T
7467-69610-0021 MAKE ANY NOISE SHE SAID HER FINGER ON HER LIP LOOKING FIRST AT MONTRESOR AND THEN AT DELAFIELD
7467-69610-0022 AND ONCE MORE LOWERED THEIR VOICES BUT THE COFFEE BROUGHT A SPIRIT OF FESTIVITY CHAIRS WERE DRAWN UP THE BLAZING FIRE SHONE OUT UPON A SEMICIRCLE OF PEOPLE REPRESENTING JUST THOSE ELEMENTS OF MINGLED INTIMACY AND NOVELTY
7467-69610-0023 WHICH GO TO MAKE CONVERSATION AND IN FIVE MINUTES MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON WAS LEADING IT AS USUAL A BRILLIANT FRENCH BOOK HAD RECENTLY APPEARED DEALING WITH CERTAIN POINTS OF THE EGYPTIAN QUESTION IN A MANNER SO INTERESTING
7467-69610-0024 SUPPLE AND APPARENTLY IMPARTIAL THAT THE ATTENTION OF EUROPE HAD BEEN WON ITS AUTHOR HAD BEEN FORMERLY A PROMINENT OFFICIAL OF THE FRENCH FOREIGN OFFICE AND WAS NOW SOMEWHAT OUT OF FAVOR WITH HIS COUNTRYMEN
7467-69610-0025 THE FRENCHMAN FEELING HIMSELF AMONG COMRADES WORTHY OF HIS STEEL
7467-69610-0026 RELINQUISHED THE HALF DISDAINFUL RESERVE WITH WHICH HE HAD ENTERED AND TOOK PAINS HE DREW THE MAN IN QUESTION EN SILHOUETTE WITH A HOSTILE TOUCH SO SURE AN IRONY SO LIGHT THAT HIS SUCCESS WAS INSTANT AND GREAT
7467-69610-0027 LORD LACKINGTON WOKE UP HANDSOME WHITE HAIRED DREAMER THAT HE WAS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING INTO THE FIRE HALF SMILING MORE OCCUPIED IN TRUTH WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS THAN WITH HIS COMPANIONS DELAFIELD HAD BROUGHT HIM IN
7467-69610-0028 EXCEPT THAT HE LIKED MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON AND OFTEN WONDERED HOW THE DEUCE LADY HENRY HAD EVER DISCOVERED SUCH AN INTERESTING AND DELIGHTFUL PERSON TO FILL SUCH AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BUT THIS FRENCHMAN CHALLENGED AND EXCITED HIM
7467-69610-0029 HE TOO BEGAN TO TALK FRENCH AND SOON
7467-69610-0030 WHICH QUICKLY MADE ITSELF APPARENT IN ENGLISH SHE WAS A LINK A SOCIAL CONJUNCTION SHE EASED ALL DIFFICULTIES SHE PIECED ALL THREADS BUT IN FRENCH HER TONGUE WAS LOOSENED
7467-69610-0031 THOUGH NEVER BEYOND THE POINT OF GRACE THE POINT OF DELICATE ADJUSTMENT TO THE TALKERS ROUND HER SO THAT PRESENTLY AND BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS SHE WAS THE QUEEN OF THE ROOM THE DUCHESS IN ECSTASY PINCHED JACOB DELAFIELD'S WRIST
7467-69610-0032 WHISPERED RAPTUROUSLY IN HIS EAR ISN'T SHE ENCHANTING JULIE TO NIGHT THAT GENTLEMAN MADE NO ANSWER THE DUCHESS REMEMBERING SHRANK BACK AND SPOKE NO MORE
7467-69610-0033 TILL JACOB LOOKED ROUND UPON HER WITH A FRIENDLY SMILE WHICH SET HER TONGUE FREE AGAIN
7467-69610-0034 MEANWHILE BEGAN TO CONSIDER THIS LADY IN BLACK WITH MORE AND MORE ATTENTION THE TALK GLIDED INTO A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE EGYPTIAN POSITION
7467-69610-0035 WHEN ELEMENTS OF DANGER AND OF DOUBT ABOUNDED AND NONE KNEW WHAT A MONTH MIGHT BRING FORTH WITH PERFECT TACT JULIE GUIDED THE CONVERSATION SO THAT ALL DIFFICULTIES WHETHER FOR THE FRENCH OFFICIAL OR THE ENGLISH STATESMAN
7467-69610-0036 WERE AVOIDED WITH A SKILL THAT NO ONE REALIZED TILL EACH SEPARATE ROCK WAS SAFELY PASSED PRESENTLY
7467-69610-0037 TO DU BARTAS WITH A GRIN THE FRENCHMAN'S EYES WERE ROUND WITH ASTONISHMENT
7467-69610-0038 SHE HAD BEEN TOUCHING INCIDENTS AND PERSONALITIES KNOWN ONLY TO THE INITIATED WITH A RESTRAINED GAYETY WHICH OFTEN BROKE DOWN INTO A CHARMING SHYNESS WHICH WAS READY TO BE SCARED AWAY IN A MOMENT BY A TONE TOO SERIOUS OR TOO POLEMICAL
7467-69610-0039 WHICH JARRED WITH THE GENERAL KEY OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH NEVER IMPOSED ITSELF
7467-69610-0040 AND THIS MODEST GAYETY WAS THE MARK OF AN INTIMATE AND FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE AH I SEE THOUGHT MONTRESOR AMUSED P HAS BEEN WRITING TO HER THE LITTLE MINX
7467-69610-0041 SO HE GAVE THE CONVERSATION A TURN AND MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON TOOK THE HINT AT ONCE
7467-69610-0042 WHILE SHE RESTED NO LESS CHARMING AS A LISTENER THAN AS A TALKER
7467-69610-0043 AND RADIANT WITH THE ANIMATION OF SUCCESS BUT ONE THING AT LAST SHE HAD FORGOTTEN SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO IMPOSE ANY CURB UPON THE VOICES ROUND HER THE DUCHESS AND LORD LACKINGTON WERE SPARRING LIKE A COUPLE OF CHILDREN
7467-69610-0044 AND MONTRESOR BROKE IN FROM TIME TO TIME
7467-69610-0045 MEREDITH THE FRENCHMAN WARKWORTH AND GENERAL FERGUS WERE DISCUSSING A GRAND REVIEW WHICH HAD BEEN HELD THE DAY BEFORE DELAFIELD HAD MOVED ROUND TO THE BACK OF JULIE'S CHAIR AND SHE WAS TALKING TO HIM
7467-69610-0046 AND HER BRAIN WAS PUZZLING AS TO HOW SHE WAS TO SECURE THE FIVE MINUTES TALK
7467-69610-0047 HE WAS ONE OF THE INTIMATES OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF SHE HERSELF HAD SUGGESTED TO MONTRESOR OF COURSE IN LADY HENRY'S NAME THAT HE SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO BRUTON STREET SOME WEDNESDAY EVENING PRESENTLY
7467-69610-0048 THERE WAS A LITTLE SHIFTING OF GROUPS JULIE SAW THAT MONTRESOR AND CAPTAIN WARKWORTH WERE TOGETHER BY THE FIREPLACE
7467-69610-0049 WAS PUTTING SHARP LITTLE QUESTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME WITH AS FEW WORDS AS MIGHT BE JULIE UNDERSTOOD THAT AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WAS GOING ON THAT MONTRESOR

7467-69610-0051 WITH A STRONG MOUTH SLIGHTLY UNDERHUNG AND A DOGGED CHIN THE WHOLE LIT BY EYES THAT WERE THE CHOSEN HOMES OF TRUTH HUMANITY AND WILL PRESENTLY SHE DISCOVERED AS THEY DREW THEIR CHAIRS A LITTLE BACK FROM THE CIRCLE THAT SHE TOO
7467-69610-0052 WAS TO BE ENCOURAGED TO TALK ABOUT WARKWORTH THE GENERAL WAS OF COURSE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH HIS PROFESSIONAL RECORD BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL INDIAN OPINIONS A FEW INCIDENTS IN THE YOUNG MAN'S EARLIER CAREER
