6199-80041-0000 OF OUR HERO LORD POPENJOY IT NEED ONLY BE SAID THAT WHEN WE LAST HEARD OF HIM HE WAS A VERY HEALTHY AND RATHER MISCHIEVOUS BOY OF FIVE YEARS OLD WHO TYRANNISED OVER HIS TWO LITTLE SISTERS THE LADY MARY AND THE LADY SARAH
6199-80041-0001 THOSE HOWEVER WHO LOOK MOST CLOSELY TO HIS CHARACTER THINK THAT THEY CAN SEE THE GERMS OF THAT FUTURE SUCCESS WHICH HIS GRANDFATHER SO EARNESTLY DESIRES FOR HIM HIS MOTHER IS QUITE SURE THAT HE WILL LIVE TO BE PRIME MINISTER
6199-80041-0002 AND HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO TRAIN HIM FOR THAT OFFICE THE HOUSE IN MUNSTER COURT HAS OF COURSE BEEN LEFT AND THE MARCHIONESS WAS ON ONE OCCASION ROUSED INTO AVOWING THAT THE FAMILY MANSION IS PREFERABLE
6199-80041-0003 BUT THEN THE FAMILY MANSION HAS BEEN SO CHANGED THAT NO GERMAIN OF A FORMER GENERATION WOULD KNOW IT THE OLD DOWAGER WHO STILL LIVES AT MANOR CROSS HAS NEVER SEEN THE CHANGE BUT LADY SARAH WHO ALWAYS SPENDS A MONTH OR TWO IN TOWN
6199-80041-0004 PRETENDS TO DISBELIEVE THAT IT IS THE SAME HOUSE ONE OF THE EVENTS IN MARY'S LIFE WHICH ASTONISHES HER MOST IS THE PERFECT FRIENDSHIP WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN HER AND HER ELDEST SISTER IN LAW
6199-80041-0005 SHE CORRESPONDS REGULARLY WITH LADY SARAH AND IS QUITE CONTENT TO HAVE HER LETTERS FILLED WITH THE MANY AILMENTS AND SCANTY COMFORTS OF THE POOR PEOPLE ON THE ESTATE LADY SARAH IS MORE THAN CONTENT TO BE ABLE TO LOVE THE MOTHER OF THE HEIR
6199-80041-0006 AND SHE DOES LOVE HER AND THE BOY TOO WITH ALL HER HEART NOW THAT THERE IS A POPENJOY A COMING BROTHERTON OF WHOM SHE CAN BE PROUD SHE FINDS NOTHING IN HER OWN LIFE WITH WHICH SHE OUGHT TO QUARREL
6199-80041-0007 THE LADIES SUSANNA AND AMELIA ALSO COME UP TO TOWN EVERY YEAR VERY GREATLY TO THEIR SATISFACTION AND ARE MOST DEVOTED TO THE YOUNG MARCHIONESS
6199-80041-0008 BUT THE ONE GUEST WHO IS HONOURED ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN SAINT JAMES SQUARE FOR WHOSE COMFORT EVERYTHING IS MADE TO GIVE WAY WHOM NOT TO TREAT WITH LOVING RESPECT IS TO SECURE A BANISHMENT FROM THE HOUSE
6199-80041-0009 WHOM ALL THE SERVANTS ARE MADE TO REGARD AS A SECOND MASTER IS THE DEAN HIS LINES HAVE CERTAINLY FALLEN TO HIM IN PLEASANT PLACES NO WOMAN IN LONDON IS MORE COURTED AND MORE POPULAR THAN THE MARCHIONESS OF BROTHERTON
6199-80041-0010 AND CONSEQUENTLY THE DEAN SPENDS HIS TWO MONTHS IN LONDON VERY COMFORTABLY BUT PERHAPS THE HAPPIEST PERIOD OF HIS LIFE IS THE RETURN VISIT WHICH HIS DAUGHTER ALWAYS MAKES TO HIM FOR A FORTNIGHT DURING THE WINTER
6199-80041-0011 ARE ALONE TOGETHER THEN HE ALMOST WORSHIPS HER UP IN LONDON HE ALLOWS HIMSELF TO BE WORSHIPPED WITH AN EXQUISITE GRACE TO MISSUS HOUGHTON THE MARCHIONESS HAS NEVER SPOKEN AND ON THAT SUBJECT SHE IS INEXORABLE
6199-80041-0012 FRIENDS HAVE INTERCEDED BUT SUCH INTERCESSION HAS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE OF WHAT NATURE MUST THE WOMAN BE WHO COULD SPEAK TO ANY FRIEND OF SUCH AN OFFENCE AS SHE HAD COMMITTED
6199-80041-0013 THE MARCHIONESS IN REFUSING TO BE RECONCILED HAS NEVER ALLUDED TO THE CAUSE OF HER ANGER BUT HAS SHOWN HER ANGER PLAINLY AND HAS PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO ABANDON IT
6199-80041-0014 HE IS PRESENT AT ALL THEIR SITTINGS AND IS INDEFATIGABLY PATIENT ON COMMITTEES BUT VERY RARELY SPEAKS IN THIS WAY HE IS GRADUALLY GAINING WEIGHT IN THE COUNTRY AND WHEN HIS HAIR IS QUITE GREY AND HIS STEP LESS FIRM THAN AT PRESENT
6199-80041-0015 HE WILL BE AN AUTHORITY IN PARLIAMENT HE IS ALSO A PATTERN LANDLORD LISTENING TO ALL COMPLAINTS AND ENDEAVOURING IN EVERYTHING TO DO JUSTICE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THOSE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON HIM
6199-80041-0016 HE IS ALSO A PATTERN FATHER EXPECTING GREAT THINGS FROM POPENJOY AND RESOLVING THAT THE CHILD SHALL BE SUBJECTED TO PROPER DISCIPLINE AS SOON AS HE IS TRANSFERRED FROM FEMININE TO VIRILE TEACHING
6199-80041-0017 IN THE MEANTIME THE MARCHIONESS REIGNS SUPREME IN THE NURSERY AS IT IS PROPER THAT SHE SHOULD DO THE HUSBAND NOW NEVER FEELS HIMSELF CALLED UPON TO REMIND HIS WIFE TO SUPPORT HER DIGNITY SINCE THE DANCING OF THE KAPPA KAPPA SHE HAS NEVER DANCED
6199-80041-0018 EXCEPT WHEN ON GRAND OCCASIONS SHE HAS WALKED THROUGH A QUADRILLE WITH SOME SELECTED PARTNER OF SPECIAL RANK AND THIS SHE DOES SIMPLY AS A DUTY NEVERTHELESS IN SOCIETY SHE IS VERY GAY AND VERY JOYOUS
6199-80041-0019 BUT DANCING HAS BEEN A PERIL TO HER AND SHE AVOIDS IT ALTOGETHER PLEADING TO SUCH FRIENDS AS MISSUS JONES THAT A WOMAN WITH A LOT OF BABIES IS OUT OF PLACE CAPERING ABOUT A ROOM
6199-80041-0020 MISSUS JONES REMEMBERS THE KAPPA KAPPA AND SAYS LITTLE OR NOTHING ON THE SUBJECT BUT SHE HEARTILY DISSENTS FROM HER FRIEND AND STILL HOPES THAT THERE MAY BE A GOOD TIME COMING
6199-80041-0021 SHOWING HIS GRATITUDE EVERY NOW AND THEN BY SUGGESTING THAT CAPTAIN AND MISSUS DE BARON MAY BE ASKED TO DINNER HE KNOWS THAT THERE IS MUCH FOR WHICH HE HAS TO BE GRATEFUL THOUGH THE NAME OF MISSUS HOUGHTON IS NEVER ON HIS TONGUE HE HAS NOT FORGOTTEN THE WAY IN WHICH HE WENT ASTRAY
6199-80041-0022 IN BERKELEY SQUARE NOR THE SWEET RETICENCE OF HIS WIFE WHO HAS NEVER THROWN HIS FAULT IN HIS TEETH SINCE THAT DAY ON WHICH AT HIS BIDDING SHE TOOK THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET AND READ IT
6199-80041-0023 AND PERHAPS NO MAN IN LONDON HAS BETTER CAUSE TO BE SATISFIED YES CAPTAIN DE BARON AND HIS WIFE DO OCCASIONALLY DINE TOGETHER IN SAINT JAMES SQUARE WHETHER IT WAS THAT MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES WAS SUCCESSFUL IN HER EFFORTS
6199-80041-0024 OR THAT GUSS WAS ENABLED TO FOUND ARGUMENTS ON JACK'S WEALTH WHICH JACK WAS UNABLE TO OPPOSE OR THAT A SENSE OF WHAT WAS DUE TO THE LADY PREVAILED WITH HIM AT LAST HE DID MARRY HER ABOUT A TWELVEMONTH AFTER THE READING OF THE WILL
6199-80041-0025 WHEN THE MARCHIONESS CAME TO TOWN BEFORE POPENJOY WAS BORN HE CALLED AND WAS ALLOWED TO SEE HER NOTHING COULD BE MORE RESPECTFUL THAN WAS HIS DEMEANOUR THEN NOR THAN IT HAD BEEN EVER SINCE
6199-80041-0026 AND WHEN HE ANNOUNCED TO HIS FRIEND AS HE DID IN PERSON THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO BE MARRIED TO MISS MILDMAY SHE CONGRATULATED HIM WITH WARMTH NOT SAYING A WORD AS TO PAST OCCURRENCES BUT SHE DETERMINED THAT SHE WOULD EVER BE HIS FRIEND
6199-80041-0027 AND FOR HIS SAKE SHE HAS BECOME FRIENDLY ALSO TO HIS WIFE SHE NEVER REALLY LIKED POOR GUSS NOR PERHAPS DOES THE CAPTAIN
6199-80041-0028 AND JACK HAS DONE HIS DUTY IN A MANNER THAT RATHER SURPRISED HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES BUT HE IS A MUCH ALTERED MAN AND IS GROWING FAT AND HAS TAKEN TO PLAYING WHIST AT HIS CLUB BEFORE DINNER FOR SHILLING POINTS
6199-80041-0029 I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS HE REGRETS THE LEGACY WHETHER TO SPITE HIS SON OR AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF HIS WIFE AND DOCTORS LORD GOSSLING HAS OF LATE BEEN SO CAREFUL
6199-80041-0030 THAT THE GOUT HAS NOT HAD A CHANCE OF GETTING INTO HIS STOMACH LORD GIBLET PROFESSES HIMSELF TO BE PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THINGS AS THEY ARE HE HAS ALREADY FOUR CHILDREN HE LIVES IN A SMALL HOUSE IN GREEN STREET
6199-80041-0031 AND SAYS THAT THE FAMILY OF DE GEESE MUST BE GOING TO THE DOGS WHEN THE HEIR HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO ATTEND TO INSECTS MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES GIVES AS MANY PARTIES AS EVER IN GROSVENOR PLACE
6199-80041-0032 AND IS NEVER SO WELL PLEASED AS WHEN SHE CAN GET THE MARCHIONESS OF BROTHERTON TO HER HOUSE SHE IS STILL ENGAGED IN MATRIMONIAL PURSUITS AND IS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT FULL OF AN IDEA THAT THE MINISTER FROM SAXONY WHO IS A FINE OLD GENTLEMAN OF SIXTY
6199-80041-0033 BUT A BACHELOR MAY BE GOT TO MARRY LADY AMELIA GERMAIN MARY ASSURES HER THAT THERE ISN'T THE LEAST CHANCE THAT AMELIA WOULD CERTAINLY NOT ACCEPT HIM AND THAT AN OLD GERMAN OF SIXTY USED TO DIPLOMACY ALL HIS LIFE
6199-80041-0034 IS THE LAST MAN IN THE WORLD TO BE LED INTO DIFFICULTIES BUT MISSUS JONES NEVER GIVES WAY IN SUCH MATTERS AND HAS ALREADY MADE THE PLANS FOR A CAMPAIGN AT KILLANCODLEM NEXT AUGUST
6199-80041-0035 I REGRET TO STATE THAT MESSRS SNAPE AND CASHETT HAVE PERSECUTED THE POOR BARONESS MOST CRUELLY THEY HAVE CONTRIVED TO SHOW THAT THE LADY HAS NOT ONLY GOT INTO THEIR DEBT BUT HAS ALSO SWINDLED THEM SWINDLED THEM ACCORDING TO LAW
6199-80041-0036 AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SET ALL THE POLICE OF THE CONTINENT ON HER TRACK SHE HAD NO SOONER SHOWN HER FACE BACK IN GERMANY THAN THEY WERE UPON HER FOR A WHILE SHE ESCAPED RUSHING FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER
6199-80041-0037 BUT AT LAST SHE WAS ARRESTED ON A PLATFORM IN OREGON AND IS SOON ABOUT TO STAND HER TRIAL IN AN ENGLISH COURT AS A GOOD DEAL OF SYMPATHY HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN HER FAVOUR
6199-80041-0038 IT IS CONFIDENTLY HOPED IN MANY QUARTERS THAT NO JURY WILL CONVICT HER IN THE MEANTIME DOCTOR FLEABODY HAS I AM TOLD MARRIED A STORE KEEPER IN NEW YORK AND HAS SETTLED DOWN INTO A GOOD MOTHER OF A FAMILY
6199-80041-0039 AT MANOR CROSS DURING THE GREATER PORTION OF THE YEAR THINGS GO ON VERY MUCH AS THEY USED THE MARCHIONESS IS STILL LIVING AND INTERESTS HERSELF CHIEFLY IN THE CHILDREN OF HER DAUGHTER IN LAW BORN AND TO BE BORN
6199-80041-0040 BUT THE GREAT DAYS OF HER LIFE ARE THOSE IN WHICH POPENJOY IS BROUGHT TO HER THE YOUNG SCAPEGRACE WILL NEVER STAY ABOVE FIVE MINUTES WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER BUT THE OLD LADY IS SURE THAT SHE IS REGARDED BY HIM WITH A LOVE PASSING THE LOVE OF CHILDREN
6199-80041-0041 AND A MONTH OR TWO AFTERWARDS THE HOUSE IS FULL OF COMPANY AND BRIGHT WITH UNACCUSTOMED LIGHTS LADY SARAH PUTS ON HER NEWEST SILK AND THE MARCHIONESS ALLOWS HERSELF TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER
6199-80041-0042 BUT AT THE END OF FEBRUARY THE YOUNG FAMILY FLITS TO TOWN AND THEN THE MANOR CROSS IS AS MANOR CROSS SO LONG HAS BEEN MISTER PRICE STILL HUNTS AND IS AS POPULAR IN THE COUNTRY AS EVER
6199-80041-0043 THE YOUNGEST OF HIS THREE CHILDREN IS OLDER THAN LADY MARY BUT WHEN HE DOES THIS AT HOME HIS EARS ARE ALWAYS BOXED FOR HIM OF MISTER GROSCHUT IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO SAY THAT HE IS STILL AT PUGSTY
6199-80041-0044 VEXING THE SOULS OF HIS PARISHIONERS BY SABBATICAL DENUNCIATIONS
