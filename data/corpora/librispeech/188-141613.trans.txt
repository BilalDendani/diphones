188-141613-0000 THIS TIME BELDINGSVILLE DID NOT LITERALLY WELCOME POLLYANNA HOME WITH BRASS BANDS AND BUNTING PERHAPS BECAUSE THE HOUR OF HER EXPECTED ARRIVAL WAS KNOWN TO BUT FEW OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE
188-141613-0001 BUT THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO LACK OF JOYFUL GREETINGS ON THE PART OF EVERYBODY FROM THE MOMENT SHE STEPPED FROM THE RAILWAY TRAIN WITH HER AUNT POLLY AND DOCTOR CHILTON NOR DID POLLYANNA LOSE ANY TIME
188-141613-0002 IN STARTING ON A ROUND OF FLY AWAY MINUTE CALLS ON ALL HER OLD FRIENDS INDEED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ACCORDING TO NANCY THERE WASN'T NO PUTTING OF YOUR FINGER ON HER ANYWHERES
188-141613-0003 SHE WA'N'T THERE AND ALWAYS EVERYWHERE SHE WENT POLLYANNA MET THE QUESTION WELL HOW DID YOU LIKE BOSTON PERHAPS TO NO ONE DID SHE ANSWER THIS MORE FULLY THAN SHE DID TO MISTER PENDLETON
188-141613-0004 AS WAS USUALLY THE CASE WHEN THIS QUESTION WAS PUT TO HER SHE BEGAN HER REPLY WITH A TROUBLED FROWN OH I LIKED IT I JUST LOVED IT SOME OF IT BUT NOT ALL OF IT SMILED MISTER PENDLETON
188-141613-0005 NO THERE'S PARTS OF IT OH I WAS GLAD TO BE THERE SHE EXPLAINED HASTILY I HAD A PERFECTLY LOVELY TIME AND LOTS OF THINGS WERE SO QUEER AND DIFFERENT YOU KNOW
188-141613-0006 LIKE EATING DINNER AT NIGHT INSTEAD OF NOONS WHEN YOU OUGHT TO EAT IT BUT EVERYBODY WAS SO GOOD TO ME AND I SAW SUCH A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS BUNKER HILL AND THE PUBLIC GARDEN AND THE SEEING BOSTON AUTOS
188-141613-0007 AND MILES OF PICTURES AND STATUES AND STORE WINDOWS AND STREETS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY END AND FOLKS I NEVER SAW SUCH A LOT OF FOLKS WELL I'M SURE
188-141613-0008 I THOUGHT YOU LIKED FOLKS COMMENTED THE MAN I DO POLLYANNA FROWNED AGAIN AND PONDERED BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF SUCH A LOT OF THEM IF YOU DON'T KNOW EM AND MISSUS CAREW WOULDN'T LET ME
188-141613-0009 SHE DIDN'T KNOW EM HERSELF SHE SAID FOLKS DIDN'T DOWN THERE THERE WAS A SLIGHT PAUSE THEN WITH A SIGH POLLYANNA RESUMED
188-141613-0010 I RECKON MAYBE THAT'S THE PART I DON'T LIKE THE MOST THAT FOLKS DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER IT WOULD BE SUCH A LOT NICER IF THEY DID WHY JUST THINK MISTER PENDLETON THERE ARE LOTS OF FOLKS THAT LIVE ON DIRTY NARROW STREETS
188-141613-0011 AND HAVE MORE THINGS TO EAT AND WEAR THAN THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH NOW IF THOSE FOLKS ONLY KNEW THE OTHER FOLKS BUT MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH MY DEAR CHILD DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
188-141613-0012 THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T CARE TO KNOW EACH OTHER HE ASKED QUIZZICALLY OH BUT SOME OF THEM DO MAINTAINED POLLYANNA IN EAGER DEFENSE
188-141613-0013 SHE SELLS BOWS LOVELY BOWS IN A BIG STORE SHE WANTS TO KNOW PEOPLE AND I INTRODUCED HER TO MISSUS CAREW AND WE HAD HER UP TO THE HOUSE AND WE HAD JAMIE AND LOTS OF OTHERS THERE TOO AND SHE WAS SO GLAD TO KNOW THEM
188-141613-0014 AND THAT'S WHAT MADE ME THINK THAT IF ONLY A LOT OF MISSUS CAREW'S KIND COULD KNOW THE OTHER KIND BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T DO THE INTRODUCING I DIDN'T KNOW MANY OF THEM MYSELF ANYWAY BUT IF THEY COULD KNOW EACH OTHER
188-141613-0015 SO THAT THE RICH PEOPLE COULD GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE PART OF THEIR MONEY BUT AGAIN MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH OH POLLYANNA POLLYANNA HE CHUCKLED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GETTING INTO PRETTY DEEP WATER
188-141613-0016 I'D LIKE TO BE ONE I DON'T DOUBT IT POLLYANNA SMILED THE MAN BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SCHEME OF YOURS FOR THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH
188-141613-0017 BRIDLED THE LITTLE GIRL AGGRIEVEDLY AS THE MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH AND ANYWAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME FOLKS SHOULD HAVE SUCH A LOT AND OTHER FOLKS SHOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING AND I DON'T LIKE IT
188-141613-0018 SURRENDERED AND LAUGHED WITH HIM WELL ANYWAY SHE REITERATED WHEN SHE HAD CAUGHT HER BREATH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL THE SAME NO DEAR I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T AGREED THE MAN
188-141613-0019 IN TALKING OF JAMIE POLLYANNA LOST HER WORRIED BAFFLED LOOK POLLYANNA LOVED TO TALK OF JAMIE HERE WAS SOMETHING SHE UNDERSTOOD HERE WAS NO PROBLEM
188-141613-0020 THAT HAD TO DEAL WITH BIG FEARSOME SOUNDING WORDS BESIDES IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WOULD NOT MISTER PENDLETON BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN MISSUS CAREW'S TAKING THE BOY INTO HER HOME
188-141613-0021 FOR WHO BETTER THAN HIMSELF COULD UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF A CHILD'S PRESENCE FOR THAT MATTER POLLYANNA TALKED TO EVERYBODY ABOUT JAMIE SHE ASSUMED THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE AS INTERESTED AS SHE HERSELF WAS
188-141613-0022 ON MOST OCCASIONS SHE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST SHOWN BUT ONE DAY SHE MET WITH A SURPRISE IT CAME THROUGH JIMMY PENDLETON SAY LOOK A HERE HE DEMANDED ONE AFTERNOON IRRITABLY
188-141613-0023 WASN'T THERE ANYBODY ELSE DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT EVERLASTING JAMIE WHY JIMMY BEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED POLLYANNA THE BOY LIFTED HIS CHIN A LITTLE
188-141613-0024 I'M NOT JIMMY BEAN I'M JIMMY PENDLETON AND I MEAN THAT I SHOULD THINK FROM YOUR TALK THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT LOONY BOY WHO CALLS THEM BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS LADY LANCELOT
188-141613-0025 HE IS A VERY NICE BOY AND HE KNOWS A LOT BOOKS AND STORIES WHY HE CAN MAKE STORIES RIGHT OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD BESIDES IT ISN'T LADY LANCELOT IT'S SIR LANCELOT
188-141613-0026 IF YOU KNEW HALF AS MUCH AS HE DOES YOU'D KNOW THAT TOO SHE FINISHED WITH FLASHING EYES JIMMY PENDLETON FLUSHED MISERABLY AND LOOKED UTTERLY WRETCHED
188-141613-0027 GROWING MORE AND MORE JEALOUS MOMENT BY MOMENT STILL DOGGEDLY HE HELD HIS GROUND WELL ANYHOW HE SCOFFED I DON'T THINK MUCH OF HIS NAME JAMIE HUMPH SOUNDS SISSY
188-141613-0028 AND I KNOW SOMEBODY ELSE THAT SAID SO TOO WHO WAS IT THERE WAS NO ANSWER WHO WAS IT DEMANDED POLLYANNA MORE PEREMPTORILY DAD
188-141613-0029 WITH HIS EYES TURNED AWAY YET THERE WAS A CURIOUS SOFTNESS IN HIS VOICE THAT WAS ALWAYS NOTICEABLE WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF HIS FATHER YOU YES TWAS JUST A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HE DIED
188-141613-0030 WE STOPPED MOST A WEEK WITH A FARMER DAD HELPED ABOUT THE HAYIN' AND I DID TOO SOME THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS AWFUL GOOD TO ME AND PRETTY QUICK SHE WAS CALLIN ME JAMIE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT SHE JUST DID
188-141613-0031 AND ONE DAY FATHER HEARD HER HE GOT AWFUL MAD SO MAD THAT I REMEMBERED IT ALWAYS WHAT HE SAID HE SAID JAMIE WASN'T NO SORT OF A NAME FOR A BOY
188-141613-0032 IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT JIMMY SAID MUCH OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PAST LIFE OF HIS BEFORE SHE HAD KNOWN HIM AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SHE PROMPTED POLLYANNA HAD FOR THE MOMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF THE CONTROVERSY
188-141613-0033 THE NAME JAMIE THAT WAS DUBBED SISSY THE BOY SIGHED WE JUST WENT ON TILL WE FOUND ANOTHER PLACE AND TWAS THERE DAD DIED
188-141613-0034 AND YOU'VE KNOWN ME EVER SINCE REPEATED JIMMY BUT IN A FAR DIFFERENT VOICE JIMMY HAD SUDDENLY COME BACK TO THE PRESENT AND TO HIS GRIEVANCE BUT THEN I AIN'T JAMIE YOU KNOW HE FINISHED WITH SCORNFUL EMPHASIS
188-141613-0035 AS HE TURNED LOFTILY AWAY LEAVING A DISTRESSED BEWILDERED POLLYANNA BEHIND HIM WELL ANYWAY I CAN BE GLAD HE DOESN'T ALWAYS ACT LIKE THIS SIGHED THE LITTLE GIRL
