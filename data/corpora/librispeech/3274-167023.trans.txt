3274-167023-0001 HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANY OF THE DOZEN ODD COUNTRY GENTLEMAN NEIGHBORS OF VON SCHLICHTEN'S BOYHOOD IN THE ARGENTINE BUT THEN TO A TERRAN ANY OF THE KINGS OF ULLER WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE A FREAK BIRTH IN A LIZARD HOUSE AT A ZOO IT WAS HARD TO GUESS WHAT IMPRESSION HARRINGTON WOULD MAKE ON AN ULLERAN

3274-167023-0007 AND THE PREDOMINANTLY REDDISH TINT OF HIS QUARTZ SPECKLES AN IMMATURE ULLERAN WOULD BE A VERY LIGHT GRAY WHITE UNDER THE ARMS AND HIS QUARTZ SPECKS WOULD RUN FROM WHITE TO PALE YELLOW THE RETINUE OF NOBLES BEHIND GURGURK RAN THROUGH THE WHOLE SPECTRUM
3274-167023-0008 FROM A PRINCELING WHO WAS ALMOST OYSTER GRAY TO OLD GHROGHRANK
3274-167023-0009 ALL OF THEM CARRIED ABOUT AS MUCH IRONMONGERY AS THE PRIME MINISTER THE PISTOLS WERE ALL TERRAN AND THE SWORDS AND DAGGERS WERE MOSTLY MADE EITHER ON TERRA OR AT THE TERRAN OPERATED STEEL WORKS ON VOLUND

3274-167023-0015 WHO IS IN YOUR CITY TO RECEIVE THE SHIPMENT OF POWER METAL MY ROYAL MASTER HAS BEEN HONORED TO BE PERMITTED TO PURCHASE FROM THE COMPANY MORE PROTOCOL ABOUT WELCOMING GORKRINK THEN GURGURK CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH A SERIES OF BARKING SOUNDS
3274-167023-0016 WERE HIS SORROW NOT SO OVERWHELMING HE WOULD HAVE COME IN HIS OWN SACRED PERSON TO EXPRESS THE PAIN AND SHAME WHICH HE FEELS THAT PEOPLE OF THE COMPANY SHOULD BE SET UPON AND ENDANGERED IN THE STREETS OF THE ROYAL CITY IF HE WEREN'T DOPED TO THE EARS
3274-167023-0017 HE PROBABLY HADN'T EVEN HEARD OF THE RIOT THE SOLDIERS OF HIS SUBLIME AND INEFFABLE MAJESTY CAME MOST PROMPTLY TO THE AID OF THE TROOPS OF THE COMPANY DID THEY NOT GENERAL VON SCHLICHTEN HARRINGTON ASKED WITHIN MINUTES YOUR EXCELLENCY
3274-167023-0018 VON SCHLICHTEN REPLIED GRAVELY THEIR PROMPTNESS VALOR AND EFFICIENCY WERE MOST EXEMPLARY GURGURK SPOKE AT LENGTH EXPRESSING HIMSELF AS DELIGHTED ON BEHALF OF HIS ROYAL MASTER AT HEARING SUCH HIGH PRAISE FROM SO DISTINGUISHED A SOLDIER
3274-167023-0019 ERIC BLOUNT THEN CONTRIBUTED A SHORT SPEECH BESEECHING THE GODS THAT THE DEEP AND BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN THE CHARTERED ULLER COMPANY AND HIS SUBLIME ETCETERA WOULD CONTINUE UNIMPAIRED AND THAT HIS SUBLIME ETCETERA WOULD ENJOY LONG LIFE AND PEACEFUL REIGN MANAGING
3274-167023-0020 AND MANAGING TO HINT THAT THINGS LIKE THAT SIMPLY DIDN'T HAPPEN AT KEEGARK THE PRINCE GORKRINK THEN SPOKE BRIEFLY IN SYMPATHY FOR THE GREAT AND GOOD FRIEND OF ALL ULLERAN PEOPLES MOHAMMED FERRIERA WHO HAD BEEN INJURED AND HOPING THAT HE WOULD SOON ENJOY FULL HEALTH AGAIN
3274-167023-0021 HE ALSO MANAGED TO CONVEY KING ORGZILD'S PLEASURE AT HAVING OBTAINED THE PLUTONIUM
3274-167023-0022 A SURE SIGN THAT HE HAD NOT LONG AGO BEEN EXPOSED TO THE FLUORINE TAINTED AIR WHICH MEN AND GEEKS ALIKE BREATHED ON NIFLHEIM
3274-167023-0023 HE DID SO FOR ONLY ONE PURPOSE TO LEARN TERRAN TECHNOLOGIES GURGURK THEN ANNOUNCED THAT SO ENORMOUS A CRIME AGAINST THE FRIENDS OF HIS SUBLIME ETCETERA HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO GO UNPUNISHED SIGNALING BEHIND HIM WITH ONE OF HIS LOWER HANDS FOR THE BOX TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD
3274-167023-0024 THE THREE TERRANS LOOKED AT THEM GRAVELY A DOUBLE DOZEN HEADS WAS STANDARD PAYMENT FOR AN ATTACK IN WHICH NO TERRAN HAD BEEN KILLED OSTENSIBLY THEY WERE THE HEADS OF THE RINGLEADERS IN PRACTICE THEY WERE USUALLY LOPPED FROM THE FIRST TWO DOZEN PRISONERS OR OVER AGE SLAVES AT HAND
3274-167023-0025 WITHOUT REGARD FOR WHETHER THE VICTIMS HAD EVEN HEARD OF THE CRIME WHICH THEY WERE EXPIATING IF THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL'S RIGHTS ASSOCIATION WERE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THESE GEEKS THEY'D ADVOCATE BOOTING OUT ALL THESE NATIVE PRINCES AND TURNING THE WHOLE PLANET OVER TO THE COMPANY
3274-167023-0026 THAT HAD BEEN THE TERRAN FEDERATION'S IDEA FROM THE BEGINNING WHY ELSE GIVE THE COMPANY'S CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE THE TITLE OF GOVERNOR GENERAL THERE WAS ANOTHER LONG SPEECH FROM GURGURK WITH THE NOBLES BEHIND HIM MURMURING ANTIPHONAL AGREEMENT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR WHICH THERE WAS A STANDARD PUN
3274-167023-0027 GEEK CHORUS AND A SPEECH OF RESPONSE FROM SID HARRINGTON STANDING STIFFLY THROUGH THE WHOLE RIGAMAROLE
