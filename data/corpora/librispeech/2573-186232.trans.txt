2573-186232-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN DUPLICITY AUNT JANE HAD A BAD NIGHT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AFTER HER TRIALS OF THE PREVIOUS DAY
2573-186232-0001 THE INVALID'S FACE SEEMED DRAWN AND GRAY AND SHE LAY UPON HER CUSHIONS BREATHING HEAVILY AND WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF VITALITY OR STRENGTH EVEN THE SHARPNESS AND PIERCING QUALITY OF HER HARD GRAY EYES WAS LACKING
2573-186232-0002 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST AT HER NIECE WAS RATHER PLEADING THAN DEFIANT I WANT YOU TO RECONSIDER YOUR DECISION OF YESTERDAY PATRICIA SHE BEGUN DON'T ASK ME TO DO THAT AUNT REPLIED THE GIRL FIRMLY MY MIND IS FULLY MADE UP
2573-186232-0003 WHY DID YOU WISH TO LEAVE ME YOUR MONEY BECAUSE YOUR NATURE IS QUITE LIKE MY OWN CHILD AND I ADMIRE YOUR INDEPENDENCE AND SPIRIT BUT MY COUSINS ARE MUCH MORE DESERVING SAID SHE THOUGHTFULLY

2573-186232-0006 PERHAPS YOU WILL TELL ME SAID AUNT JANE CURIOUSLY WITH PLEASURE RETURNED PATSY MISTER BRADLEY LEFT YOU THIS PROPERTY BECAUSE HE LOVED YOU AND LOVE BLINDED HIM TO ALL SENSE OF JUSTICE
2573-186232-0007 WHO AT THAT TIME WAS NOT MARRIED AND HAD NO SON EXPLAINED AUNT JANE CALMLY BUT HE DID NOT FORGET HER AND ASKED ME TO LOOK AFTER KATHERINE BRADLEY IN CASE SHE OR HER HEIRS EVER NEEDED HELP I HAVE DONE SO
2573-186232-0008 AND YOU WOULD BE DOING THE RIGHT THING AT LAST I WON'T SAID AUNT JANE ANGRILY IT WOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERATE AND JUST TO THE MEMORY OF MISTER BRADLEY CONTINUED THE GIRL WHAT'S GOING TO BECAME OF KENNETH
2573-186232-0009 BUT HE OUGHT TO HAVE ELMHURST AT LEAST PLEADED THE GIRL WON'T YOU LEAVE IT TO HIM AUNT JANE NO THEN DO AS YOU PLEASE CRIED PATSY
2573-186232-0010 AS A MATTER OF JUSTICE THE PLACE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN YOURS AND I WON'T ACCEPT A DOLLAR OF THE MONEY IF I STARVE TO DEATH THINK OF YOUR FATHER SUGGESTED AUNT JANE CUNNINGLY AH I'VE DONE THAT SAID THE GIRL
2573-186232-0011 AND I KNOW HOW MANY COMFORTS I COULD BUY FOR THE DEAR MAJOR ALSO I'D LIKE TO GO TO A GIRL'S COLLEGE LIKE SMITH OR WELLESLEY AND GET A PROPER EDUCATION BUT NOT WITH YOUR MONEY AUNT JANE IT WOULD BURN MY FINGERS
2573-186232-0012 ALWAYS I WOULD THINK THAT IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN HARD AND MISERLY THIS SAME MONEY WOULD HAVE SAVED MY MOTHER'S LIFE NO I LOATHE YOUR MONEY KEEP IT OR THROW IT TO THE DOGS IF YOU WON'T GIVE IT TO THE BOY IT BELONGS TO
2573-186232-0013 AND IF I STAY HERE I'LL SAY THINGS I SHALL BE SORRY FOR WITH THESE WORDS SHE MARCHED OUT OF THE ROOM HER CHEEKS FLAMING AND AUNT JANE LOOKED AFTER HER WITH ADMIRING EYES SHE'S RIGHT SHE WHISPERED TO HERSELF
2573-186232-0014 ALWAYS THE GIRL PLEADED FOR KENNETH TO INHERIT AND DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE MONEY AND ELMHURST AND ALWAYS AUNT JANE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO CONSIDER THE BOY AND TRIED TO TEMPT THE GIRL
2573-186232-0015 AND ALTHOUGH NEITHER BETH NOR LOUISE
2573-186232-0016 AND THE FIRMNESS WITH WHICH SHE MAINTAINED IT WITH PATSY OUT OF THE FIELD IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE THE ESTATE WOULD BE DIVIDED BETWEEN HER COUSINS OR EVEN GO ENTIRE TO ONE OR THE OTHER OF THEM
2573-186232-0017 AND THIS HOPE CONSTANTLY BUOYED THEIR SPIRITS AND FILLED THEIR DAYS WITH INTEREST AS THEY WATCHED THE FIGHT BETWEEN THEIR AUNT AND THEIR COUSIN PATRICIA NEVER TOLD THEM SHE WAS PLEADING SO HARD FOR THE BOY IT WOULD ONLY PAIN HER COUSINS
2573-186232-0018 HER NATURAL CUNNING AND DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER OWN WAY ENHANCED BY HER ILLNESS THE WOMAN DECIDED TO DECEIVE PATRICIA AND ENJOY HER FEW REMAINING DAYS IN PEACE SUPPOSE SHE SAID TO MISTER WATSON
2573-186232-0019 MY PRESENT WILL STANDS AND AFTER MY DEATH THE ESTATE BECOMES THE PROPERTY OF PATRICIA CAN SHE REFUSE IT NOT LEGALLY RETURNED THE LAWYER IT WOULD REMAIN IN HER NAME BUT UNDER MY CONTROL DURING HER MINORITY
2573-186232-0020 SHE COULD TRANSFER IT AS SHE MIGHT CHOOSE BY THAT TIME SHE WILL HAVE GAINED MORE SENSE DECLARED AUNT JANE MUCH PLEASED WITH THIS ASPECT OF THE CASE AND IT ISN'T REASONABLE
2573-186232-0021 THAT HAVING ENJOYED A FORTUNE FOR A TIME ANY GIRL WOULD THROW IT AWAY I'LL STICK TO MY POINT SILAS BUT I'LL TRY TO MAKE PATRICIA BELIEVE SHE HAS WON ME OVER THEREFORE
2573-186232-0022 AND IF YOU LONG TO SEE KENNETH THE OWNER OF ELMHURST I WILL HAVE A NEW WILL DRAWN IN HIS FAVOR PATRICIA COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HER EARS DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT AUNT SHE ASKED FLUSHING RED WITH PLEASURE
2573-186232-0023 THAT SHE COULD ALMOST LOVE AUNT JANE FOR HER FINAL IF DILATORY ACT OF JUSTICE MISTER WATSON CHANCED TO ENTER THE ROOM AT THAT MOMENT AND THE GIRL CRIED OUT TELL HIM AUNT LET HIM GET THE PAPER READY AT ONCE
2573-186232-0024 THERE IS NO REASON FOR HASTE SAID AUNT JANE MEETING THE LAWYER'S QUESTIONING GAZE WITH SOME EMBARRASSMENT SILAS WATSON WAS AN HONORABLE AND UPRIGHT MAN AND HIS CLIENT'S FREQUENT DOUBTFUL METHODS HAD IN PAST YEARS MET HIS SEVERE CENSURE
2573-186232-0025 YET HE HAD ONCE PROMISED HIS DEAD FRIEND TOM BRADLEY THAT HE WOULD SERVE JANE MERRICK FAITHFULLY HE HAD STRIVEN TO DO SO BEARING WITH HER FAULTS OF CHARACTER WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT CORRECT THEM
2573-186232-0026 HIS INFLUENCE OVER HER HAD NEVER BEEN VERY STRONG HOWEVER AND HE HAD LEARNED THAT IT WAS THE MOST EASY AS WELL AS SATISFACTORY METHOD TO BOW TO HER IRON WILL
2573-186232-0027 BUT HE HAD BY NO MEANS UNDERSTOOD HER PRESENT OBJECT NOR DID SHE MEAN THAT HE SHOULD SO SHE ANSWERED HIS QUESTIONING LOOK BY SAYING I HAVE PROMISED PATRICIA THAT YOU SHALL DRAW A NEW WILL LEAVING ALL MY ESTATE TO KENNETH FORBES
2573-186232-0028 EXCEPT FOR THE BEQUESTS THAT ARE MENTIONED IN THE PRESENT PAPER THE LAWYER REGARDED HER WITH AMAZEMENT THEN HIS BROW DARKENED FOR HE THOUGHT SHE WAS PLAYING WITH THE GIRL AND WAS NOT SINCERE
2573-186232-0029 TELL HIM TO DRAW UP THE PAPER RIGHT AWAY AUNT BEGGED PATRICIA WITH SPARKLING EYES AS SOON AS YOU CAN SILAS SAID THE INVALID AND AUNT CAN'T YOU SPARE A LITTLE MORE TO LOUISE AND BETH IT WOULD MAKE THEM SO HAPPY
2573-186232-0030 DOUBLE THE AMOUNT I HAD ALLOWED TO EACH OF THEM THE WOMAN COMMANDED HER LAWYER CAN IT ALL BE READY TO SIGN TONIGHT ASKED PATSY EXCITEDLY I'LL TRY MY DEAR REPLIED THE OLD LAWYER GRAVELY THEN HE TURNED TO JANE MERRICK ARE YOU IN EARNEST HE ASKED
2573-186232-0031 PATSY'S HEART SUDDENLY SANK YES WAS THE REPLY I AM TIRED OF OPPOSING THIS CHILD'S WISHES WHAT DO I CARE WHAT BECOMES OF MY MONEY WHEN I AM GONE ALL THAT I DESIRE IS TO HAVE MY REMAINING DAYS PEACEFUL
