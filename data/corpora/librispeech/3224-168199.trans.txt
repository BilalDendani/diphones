3224-168199-0000 HIS OWN NAME NOT BEING KNOWN
3224-168199-0001 BY REASON OF HIS LONG RESIDENCE IN BRASIL HENCE HE WAS FORCED TO FLY WHEN THE PORTUGUESE RETOOK THOSE COUNTRIES FROM THE DUTCH SEVERAL NATIONS THEN INHABITING AT BRASIL AS ENGLISH FRENCH DUTCH AND OTHERS
3224-168199-0002 THEY MADE HIM CAPTAIN WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER HE TOOK A GREAT SHIP COMING FROM NEW SPAIN WHICH HAD A GREAT QUANTITY OF PLATE ON BOARD AND CARRIED IT TO JAMAICA THIS ACTION GOT HIM A GREAT REPUTATION AT HOME
3224-168199-0003 AND THOUGH IN HIS PRIVATE AFFAIRS HE GOVERNED HIMSELF VERY WELL HE WOULD OFTENTIMES APPEAR BRUTISH AND FOOLISH WHEN IN DRINK RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE STREETS BEATING AND WOUNDING THOSE HE MET NO PERSON DARING TO MAKE ANY RESISTANCE TO THE SPANIARDS HE WAS ALWAYS VERY
3224-168199-0004 BARBAROUS AND CRUEL OUT OF AN INVETERATE HATRED AGAINST THAT NATION OF THESE HE COMMANDED SEVERAL TO BE ROASTED ALIVE ON WOODEN SPITS FOR NOT SHOWING HIM HOG YARDS WHERE HE MIGHT STEAL SWINE AFTER MANY OF THESE CRUELTIES AS HE WAS CRUISING ON THE COASTS OF CAMPECHY
3224-168199-0005 A DISMAL TEMPEST SURPRISED HIM SO VIOLENTLY THAT HIS SHIP WAS WRECKED UPON THE COASTS THE MARINERS ONLY ESCAPING WITH THEIR MUSKETS AND SOME FEW BULLETS AND POWDER WHICH WERE THE ONLY THINGS THEY COULD SAVE
3224-168199-0006 HERE THEY GOT ASHORE IN A CANOE AND MARCHING ALONG THE COAST WITH ALL THE SPEED THEY COULD
3224-168199-0007 THE COMMON REFUGE OF THE PIRATES BEING UPON HIS JOURNEY AND ALL VERY HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AS IS USUAL IN DESERT PLACES THEY WERE PURSUED BY A TROOP OF AN HUNDRED SPANIARDS BRASILIANO PERCEIVING THEIR IMMINENT DANGER ENCOURAGED HIS COMPANIONS
3224-168199-0008 TELLING THEM THEY WERE BETTER SOLDIERS AND OUGHT RATHER TO DIE UNDER THEIR ARMS FIGHTING AS IT BECAME MEN OF COURAGE THAN SURRENDER TO THE SPANIARDS WHO WOULD TAKE AWAY THEIR LIVES WITH THE UTMOST TORMENTS THE PIRATES WERE BUT THIRTY
3224-168199-0009 YET SEEING THEIR BRAVE COMMANDER OPPOSE THE ENEMY WITH SUCH COURAGE RESOLVED TO DO THE LIKE HEREUPON THEY FACED THE TROOP OF SPANIARDS AND DISCHARGED THEIR MUSKETS ON THEM SO DEXTROUSLY THAT THEY KILLED ONE HORSEMAN ALMOST WITH EVERY SHOT
3224-168199-0010 HAVING VANQUISHED THE ENEMY THEY MOUNTED ON HORSES THEY FOUND IN THE FIELD AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY BRASILIANO HAVING LOST BUT TWO OF HIS COMPANIONS IN THIS BLOODY FIGHT AND HAD TWO WOUNDED PROSECUTING THEIR WAY BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE PORT THEY SPIED A BOAT AT ANCHOR FROM CAMPECHY
3224-168199-0011 WELL MANNED PROTECTING A FEW CANOES THAT WERE LADING WOOD HEREUPON THEY SENT SIX OF THEIR MEN TO WATCH THEM WHO NEXT MORNING BY A WILE POSSESSED THEMSELVES OF THE CANOES HAVING GIVEN NOTICE TO THEIR COMPANIONS THEY BOARDED THEM AND ALSO TOOK THE LITTLE MAN OF WAR THEIR CONVOY
3224-168199-0012 BEING THUS MASTERS OF THIS FLEET THEY WANTED ONLY PROVISIONS OF WHICH THEY FOUND LITTLE ABOARD THOSE VESSELS BUT THIS DEFECT WAS SUPPLIED BY THE HORSES WHICH THEY KILLED AND SALTED WITH SALT WHICH BY GOOD FORTUNE THE WOOD CUTTERS HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM WITH WHICH THEY SUPPORTED THEMSELVES TILL THEY COULD GET BETTER
3224-168199-0013 LADEN WITH DIVERS SORTS OF MERCHANDISE AND PIECES OF EIGHT DESIGNED TO BUY COCOA NUTS FOR THEIR LADING HOME
3224-168199-0014 GIVING THEMSELVES TO ALL MANNER OF DEBAUCHERY SUCH OF THESE PIRATES WILL SPEND TWO OR THREE THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT IN A NIGHT NOT LEAVING THEMSELVES A GOOD SHIRT TO WEAR IN THE MORNING MY OWN MASTER WOULD BUY SOMETIMES A PIPE OF WINE
3224-168199-0015 AND PLACING IT IN THE STREET WOULD FORCE THOSE THAT PASSED BY TO DRINK WITH HIM
3224-168199-0016 AND VERY OFTEN HE WOULD THROW THESE LIQUORS ABOUT THE STREETS AND WET PEOPLES CLOTHES WITHOUT REGARDING WHETHER HE SPOILED THEIR APPAREL AMONG THEMSELVES THESE PIRATES ARE VERY LIBERAL IF ANY ONE HAS LOST ALL WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS IN THEIR MANNER OF LIFE
3224-168199-0017 BUT AT JAMAICA THEY OUGHT NOT TO RUN VERY DEEP IN DEBT SEEING THE INHABITANTS THERE EASILY SELL ONE ANOTHER FOR DEBT
3224-168199-0018 THIS MAN HAD WITHIN THREE MONTHS BEFORE THREE THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT IN READY CASH ALL WHICH HE WASTED IN THAT LITTLE TIME AND BECAME AS POOR AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
3224-168199-0019 AFTER HAVING SPENT ALL WAS FORCED TO GO TO SEA AGAIN TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE HE SET FORTH TOWARDS THE COAST OF CAMPECHY HIS COMMON RENDEZVOUS FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL
3224-168199-0020 INTENDING TO HANG THEM EVERY ONE AND DOUBTLESS HE HAD DONE SO BUT FOR A STRATAGEM OF BRASILIANO WHICH SAVED THEIR LIVES HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR IN THE NAMES OF OTHER PIRATES THAT WERE ABROAD AT SEA TELLING THEM HE SHOULD HAVE A CARE HOW HE USED THOSE PERSONS HE HAD IN CUSTODY
3224-168199-0021 FOR IF HE HURT THEM IN THE LEAST THEY SWORE THEY WOULD NEVER GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD THAT SHOULD FALL INTO THEIR HANDS THESE PIRATES HAVING BEEN OFTEN AT CAMPECHY AND OTHER PLACES OF THE WEST INDIES IN THE SPANISH DOMINIONS THE GOVERNOR FEARED WHAT MISCHIEF THEIR COMPANIONS ABROAD MIGHT DO
3224-168199-0022 IF HE SHOULD PUNISH THEM HEREUPON HE RELEASED THEM EXACTING ONLY AN OATH ON THEM
3224-168199-0023 AND WITHAL HE SENT THEM AS COMMON MARINERS IN THE GALLEONS TO SPAIN THEY GOT IN THIS VOYAGE ALL TOGETHER FIVE HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT SO THAT THEY TARRIED NOT LONG THERE AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL PROVIDING THEMSELVES WITH NECESSARIES THEY RETURNED TO JAMAICA FROM WHENCE THEY SET FORTH AGAIN TO SEA
3224-168199-0024 BUT ESPECIALLY ABUSING THE POOR SPANIARDS WHO FELL INTO THEIR HANDS WITH ALL SORTS OF CRUELTY THE SPANIARDS FINDING THEY COULD GAIN NOTHING ON THESE PEOPLE NOR DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER DAILY RESOLVED TO LESSEN THE NUMBER OF THEIR TRADING SHIPS BUT NEITHER WAS THIS OF ANY SERVICE
3224-168199-0025 AFTER SCOT CAME ANOTHER NAMED MANSVELT WHO INVADED GRANADA AND PENETRATED EVEN TO THE SOUTH SEA TILL AT LAST FOR WANT OF PROVISION HE WAS FORCED TO GO BACK HE ASSAULTED THE ISLE OF SAINT CATHERINE WHICH HE TOOK WITH A FEW PRISONERS THESE DIRECTED HIM TO CARTHAGENA
3224-168199-0026 A PRINCIPAL CITY IN NEUVA GRANADA BUT THE BOLD ATTEMPTS AND ACTIONS OF JOHN DAVIS BORN AT JAMAICA OUGHT NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN BEING SOME OF THE MOST REMARKABLE ESPECIALLY HIS RARE PRUDENCE AND VALOUR SHOWED IN THE FORE MENTIONED KINGDOM OF GRANADA THIS PIRATE HAVING LONG CRUISED IN THE GULF OF POCATAURO
3224-168199-0027 AND NOT MEETING ANY OF THEM RESOLVED AT LAST TO LAND IN NICARAGUA LEAVING HIS SHIP HID ON THE COAST THIS DESIGN HE SOON EXECUTED FOR TAKING EIGHTY MEN OUT OF NINETY WHICH HE HAD IN ALL AND THE REST HE LEFT TO KEEP THE SHIP HE DIVIDED THEM EQUALLY INTO THREE CANOES
3224-168199-0028 HIS INTENT WAS TO ROB THE CHURCHES AND RIFLE THE HOUSES OF THE CHIEF CITIZENS OF NICARAGUA THUS IN THE DARK NIGHT THEY ENTERED THE RIVER LEADING TO THAT CITY ROWING IN THEIR CANOES BY DAY THEY HID THEMSELVES AND BOATS UNDER THE BRANCHES OF TREES ON THE BANKS
3224-168199-0029 WHICH GROW VERY THICK ALONG THE RIVER SIDES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND ALONG THE SEA COAST BEING ARRIVED AT THE CITY THE THIRD NIGHT THE SENTINEL WHO KEPT THE POST OF THE RIVER THOUGHT THEM TO BE FISHERMEN THAT HAD BEEN FISHING IN THE LAKE AND MOST OF THE PIRATES UNDERSTANDING SPANISH
3224-168199-0030 HE DOUBTED NOT AS SOON AS HE HEARD THEM SPEAK THEY HAD IN THEIR COMPANY AN INDIAN WHO HAD RUN AWAY FROM HIS MASTER
3224-168199-0031 HE WENT FIRST ASHORE AND INSTANTLY KILLED THE SENTINEL THIS DONE THEY ENTERED THE CITY AND WENT DIRECTLY TO THREE OR FOUR HOUSES OF THE CHIEF CITIZENS WHERE THEY KNOCKED SOFTLY THESE BELIEVING THEM TO BE FRIENDS OPENED THE DOORS AND THE PIRATES SUDDENLY POSSESSING THEMSELVES OF THE HOUSES
3224-168199-0032 SO THAT THE WHOLE CITY WAS IN AN UPROAR AND ALL THE CITIZENS RALLIED IN ORDER TO A DEFENCE
3224-168199-0033 AND SOME PRISONERS THESE THEY LED AWAY THAT IF ANY OF THEM SHOULD BE TAKEN BY THE SPANIARDS THEY MIGHT USE THEM FOR RANSOM THUS THEY GOT TO THEIR SHIP AND WITH ALL SPEED PUT TO SEA FORCING THE PRISONERS BEFORE THEY LET THEM GO
3224-168199-0034 BUT NO SOONER HAD THEY WEIGHED ANCHOR WHEN THEY SAW A TROOP OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SPANIARDS ALL WELL ARMED AT THE SEA SIDE AGAINST THESE THEY LET FLY SEVERAL GUNS WHEREWITH THEY FORCED THEM TO QUIT THE SANDS
3224-168199-0035 WITH ALL THIS THEY ARRIVED AT JAMAICA SOON AFTER BUT THIS SORT OF PEOPLE BEING NEVER LONG MASTERS OF THEIR MONEY THEY WERE SOON CONSTRAINED TO SEEK MORE BY THE SAME MEANS AND CAPTAIN JOHN DAVIS PRESENTLY AFTER HIS RETURN WAS CHOSEN ADMIRAL OF SEVEN OR EIGHT VESSELS
