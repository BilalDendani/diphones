4660-25053-0000 WHEN I COULD AFFORD A HORSE AND COULD KEEP PACE WITH HIM
4660-25053-0001 AND THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL IT DOWN OR BAY IT
4660-25053-0002 A BROKEN LEG SHOWS AT ONCE BUT A BODY SHOT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PLACE AND ANIMALS SHOT THROUGH THE LUNGS AND EVEN THROUGH THE LOWER PART OF THE HEART OFTEN GO AWAY AT A CRACKING PACE AND ARE OUT OF SIGHT IN NO TIME PERHAPS TO KEEP IT UP FOR MILES
4660-25053-0003 PERHAPS TO DROP DEAD WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT DAY WITH THE IMPALA WE HAD MANY GOOD DAYS TOGETHER AND MANY HARD ONES WE HAD OUR DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT WE HAD OUR TRIUMPHS AND WE WERE BOTH GETTING TO KNOW OUR WAY ABOUT BY DEGREES
4660-25053-0004 BUCK OF MANY KINDS HAD FALLEN TO US BUT SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED THERE WAS ONE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT WAS NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN THE PICTURE OF THAT KOODOO BULL AS HE APPEARED FOR THE LAST TIME LOOKING OVER THE ANT HEAP THE DAY WE WERE LOST WAS ALWAYS BEFORE ME
4660-25053-0005 I COULD NOT HEAR THE NAME OR SEE THE SPOOR OF KOODOO WITHOUT A PANG OF REGRET AND THE THOUGHT THAT NEVER AGAIN WOULD SUCH A CHANCE OCCUR KOODOO LIKE OTHER KINDS OF GAME WERE NOT TO BE FOUND EVERYWHERE THEY FAVOURED SOME LOCALITIES MORE THAN OTHERS
4660-25053-0006 AND WHEN WE PASSED THROUGH THEIR KNOWN HAUNTS CHANCES OF SMALLER GAME WERE OFTEN NEGLECTED IN THE HOPE OF COMING ACROSS THE KOODOO I COULD NOT GIVE UP WHOLE DAYS TO HUNTING FOR WE HAD TO KEEP MOVING ALONG WITH THE WAGGONS ALL THE TIME
4660-25053-0007 OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY ENOUGH IN MANY PARTS TO LOCATE THE KOODOO AND MAKE SURE OF GETTING A GOOD BAG AS IT WAS ON THREE OR FOUR OCCASIONS WE DID COME ACROSS THEM AND ONCE I GOT A RUNNING SHOT BUT MISSED THIS WAS NOT NEEDED TO KEEP MY INTEREST IN THEM ALIVE
4660-25053-0008 BUT IT MADE ME KEENER THAN EVER DAY BY DAY I WENT OUT ALWAYS HOPING TO GET MY CHANCE AND WHEN AT LAST THE CHANCE DID COME IT WAS QUITE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY OTHERS THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST EXPECTED
4660-25053-0009 THE GREAT CHARM OF BUSHVELD HUNTING IS ITS VARIETY YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL TURN UP NEXT THE ONLY CERTAINTY BEING THAT IT WILL NOT BE WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTING
4660-25053-0010 HE HAD BEEN QUITE CLOSE TO IT HE SAID AND IT WAS VERY TAME
4660-25053-0011 WILL OFTEN TAKE NO NOTICE OF NATIVES ALLOWING THEM TO APPROACH TO VERY CLOSE QUARTERS
4660-25053-0012 AND THUS DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE MAN IN THIS CASE THE BONNY LITTLE RED BROWN FELLOW WAS NOT A BIT SCARED HE MAINTAINED HIS PRESENCE OF MIND ADMIRABLY FROM TIME TO TIME HE TURNED HIS HEAD OUR WAY
4660-25053-0013 AND WITH HIS LARGE BUT SHAPELY AND MOST SENSITIVE EARS THROWN FORWARD EXAMINED US FRANKLY WHILE HE MOVED SLIGHTLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO AS TO KEEP UNDER COVER OF THE OXEN AND BUSILY CONTINUE HIS BROWSING
4660-25053-0014 AND THEN WITHOUT GIVING ME A CHANCE HE WAS OFF INTO THE BUSH IN A FEW FRISKY SKIPS I FOLLOWED QUIETLY KNOWING THAT AS HE WAS ON THE FEED AND NOT SCARED HE WOULD NOT GO FAR
4660-25053-0015 MOVING ALONG SILENTLY UNDER GOOD COVER I REACHED A THICK SCRUBBY BUSH AND PEERED OVER THE TOP OF IT TO SEARCH THE GRASS UNDER THE SURROUNDING THORN TREES FOR THE LITTLE RED BROWN FORM I WAS LOOKING ABOUT LOW DOWN IN THE RUSSETY GRASS
4660-25053-0016 FOR HE WAS ONLY ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF JOCK
4660-25053-0017 WHEN A MOVEMENT ON A HIGHER LEVEL CAUGHT MY EYE IT WAS JUST THE FLIP OF A FLY TICKLED EAR BUT IT WAS A MOVEMENT WHERE ALL ELSE WAS STILL AND INSTANTLY THE FORM OF A KOODOO COW APPEARED BEFORE ME AS A PICTURE IS THROWN ON A SCREEN BY A MAGIC LANTERN
4660-25053-0018 THE STEM OF A MIMOSA HID THE SHOULDERS BUT ALL THE REST WAS PLAINLY VISIBLE AS IT STOOD THERE UTTERLY UNCONSCIOUS OF DANGER THE TREE MADE A DEAD SHOT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE RISK OF TRYING FOR ANOTHER POSITION WAS TOO GREAT AND I FIRED
4660-25053-0019 THE THUD OF THE BULLET AND THE TREMENDOUS BOUND OF THE KOODOO STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR TOLD THAT THE SHOT HAD GONE HOME BUT THESE THINGS WERE FOR A TIME FORGOTTEN IN THE SURPRISE THAT FOLLOWED AT THE SOUND OF THE SHOT TWENTY OTHER KOODOO JUMPED INTO LIFE AND SIGHT BEFORE ME
4660-25053-0020 THE ONE I HAD SEEN AND SHOT WAS BUT ONE OF A HERD ALL DOZING PEACEFULLY IN THE SHADE AND STRANGEST OF ALL IT WAS THE ONE THAT WAS FARTHEST FROM ME TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THIS ONE AT DISTANCES FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY YARDS FROM ME
4660-25053-0021 THE MAGNIFICENT CREATURES HAD BEEN STANDING AND I HAD NOT SEEN THEM IT WAS THE FLICKER OF THIS ONE'S EAR ALONE THAT HAD CAUGHT MY EYE
4660-25053-0022 ALL EXCEPT THE WOUNDED ONE WHICH HAD TURNED OFF FROM THE OTHERS
4660-25053-0023 AND NOTING HER TUCKED UP APPEARANCE AND SHORTENED STRIDES SET JOCK ON HER TRAIL BELIEVING THAT SHE WOULD BE DOWN IN A FEW MINUTES IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GO OVER IT ALL AGAIN IT WAS MUCH THE SAME AS THE IMPALA CHASE
4660-25053-0024 THINGS LOOKED VERY BLACK INDEED I HEARD HIS PANTING BREATH BEFORE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEE ANYTHING IT WAS PAST ONE O'CLOCK WHEN HE RETURNED AS WE HAD MISSED THE NIGHT TREK TO WAIT FOR JOCK
4660-25053-0025 I DECIDED TO STAY ON WHERE WE WERE UNTIL THE NEXT EVENING AND TO HAVE ANOTHER TRY FOR THE WOUNDED KOODOO WITH THE CHANCE OF COMING ACROSS THE TROOP AGAIN BY DAYBREAK
4660-25053-0026 AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN ROUGHLY GRAVELLED THERE HE SEEMED A LITTLE STIFF AND FLINCHED WHEN I PRESSED HIS SIDES AND MUSCLES BUT HE WAS AS GAME AS EVER WHEN HE SAW THE RIFLE TAKEN DOWN THE KOODOO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BODY
4660-25053-0027 AND EVEN WITHOUT BEING RUN TO DEATH BY JOCK MUST HAVE DIED IN THE NIGHT OR HAVE LAIN DOWN AND BECOME TOO COLD AND STIFF TO MOVE IF NOT DISCOVERED BY WILD ANIMALS THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE OF FINDING IT UNTOUCHED IN THE EARLY MORNING
4660-25053-0028 BUT AFTER SUNRISE EVERY MINUTE'S DELAY MEANT FRESH RISK FROM THE AASVOGELS THERE IS VERY LITTLE WHICH IF LEFT UNCOVERED WILL ESCAPE THEIR EYES
4660-25053-0029 AND RETURN IN HALF AN HOUR TO FIND NOTHING BUT A FEW BONES THE HORNS AND HOOFS A RAG OF SKIN AND A GROUP OF DISGUSTING GORGED VULTURES SQUATTING ON A PATCH OF GROUND ALL SMEARED TORN AND FEATHER STREWN FROM THEIR VORACIOUS STRUGGLES
4660-25053-0030 IN THE EARLY MORNING FROM THEIR WHITE SPLASHED EERIES ON SOME DISTANT MOUNTAIN THEY SLIDE OFF LIKE A LAUNCHING SHIP INTO THEIR SEA OF BLUE AND STRIKING THE CURRENTS OF THE UPPER AIR SWEEP ROUND AND UPWARDS IN IMMENSE CIRCLES
4660-25053-0031 THEIR HUGE MOTIONLESS WINGS CARRYING THEM HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL THEY ARE LOST TO HUMAN SIGHT LIE ON YOUR BACK IN SOME DENSE SHADE WHERE NO SIDE LIGHTS STRIKE IN BUT WHERE AN OPENING ABOVE FORMS A SORT OF NATURAL TELESCOPE TO THE SKY
4660-25053-0032 AND YOU MAY SEE TINY SPECKS WHERE NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BEFORE TAKE YOUR FIELD GLASSES THE SPECKS ARE VULTURES CIRCLING UP ON HIGH LOOK AGAIN AND FAR FAR ABOVE YOU
4660-25053-0033 AND FOR AUGHT YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE OTHERS STILL BEYOND HOW HIGH ARE THEY AND WHAT CAN THEY SEE FROM THERE WHO KNOWS BUT THIS IS SURE THAT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES SCORES WILL COME SWOOPING DOWN IN GREAT SPIRAL RUSHES WHERE NOT ONE WAS VISIBLE BEFORE
4660-25053-0034 WATCHING JEALOUSLY AS HUNGRY DOGS DO FOR THE LEAST SUSPICIOUS SIGN TO SWOOP DOWN AND SHARE THE SPOIL
4660-25053-0035 AND FROM THAT ON HE LED THE WAY IT WAS MUCH SLOWER WORK THEN AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED THERE WAS NOTHING TO GUIDE ME AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS AFTER
4660-25053-0036 AND IF SO WAS HE FOLLOWING THE SCENT OF THE OLD CHASE OR MERELY WHAT HE MIGHT REMEMBER OF THE WAY HE HAD GONE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT SCENT COULD LIE IN THAT DRY COUNTRY FOR TWELVE HOURS YET IT WAS CLEARLY NOSE MORE THAN EYES THAT GUIDED HIM
4660-25053-0037 HE WENT AHEAD SOBERLY AND STEADILY AND ONCE WHEN HE STOPPED COMPLETELY TO SNIFF AT A PARTICULAR TUFT OF GRASS I FOUND OUT WHAT WAS HELPING HIM THE GRASS WAS WELL STREAKED WITH BLOOD QUITE DRY IT IS TRUE STILL IT WAS BLOOD
4660-25053-0038 A MILE OR SO ON WE CHECKED AGAIN WHERE THE GRASS WAS TRAMPLED AND THE GROUND SCORED WITH SPOOR
4660-25053-0039 OUTSIDE THIS THE GRASS WAS ALSO FLATTENED AND THERE I FOUND A DOG'S FOOTPRINTS
4660-25053-0040 WHILE I WAS EXAMINING IT HE PICKED UP THE TRAIL AND TROTTED ON WE CAME UPON FOUR OR FIVE OTHER RINGS WHERE THEY HAD FOUGHT THE LAST OF THESE WAS CURIOUSLY DIVIDED BY A FALLEN TREE
4660-25053-0041 EVIDENTLY THE KOODOO HAD BACKED AGAINST IT WHILST FACING JOCK AND HAD FALLEN OVER IT RENEWING THE FIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE WERE ALSO SOME GOLDEN HAIRS STICKING ON THE STUMPY END OF A BROKEN BRANCH WHICH MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH JOCK'S SCRAPED SIDES
4660-25053-0042 THEN FOR A MATTER OF A HUNDRED YARDS OR MORE IT LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD FOUGHT AND TUMBLED ALL THE WAY JOCK WAS SOME DISTANCE AHEAD OF ME TROTTING ALONG QUIETLY WHEN I SAW HIM LOOK UP GIVE THAT RARE GROWLING BARK OF HIS ONE OF SUPPRESSED BUT REAL FURY
4660-25053-0043 LOWER HIS HEAD AND CHARGE THEN CAME HEAVY FLAPPING AND SCRAMBLING AND THE WIND OF HUGE WINGS AS TWENTY OR THIRTY GREAT LUMBERING AASVOGELS FLOPPED ALONG THE GROUND WITH JOCK DASHING FURIOUSLY ABOUT AMONG THEM
4660-25053-0044 AND HIS JAWS SNAPPING LIKE RAT TRAPS AS HE MISSED THEM ON A LITTLE OPEN FLAT OF HARD BAKED SAND LAY THE STRIPPED FRAME OF THE KOODOO THE HEAD AND LEG BONES WERE MISSING MEAT STRIPPED FRAGMENTS WERE SCATTERED ALL ABOUT
4660-25053-0045 FIFTY YARDS AWAY AMONG SOME BUSHES JOCK FOUND THE HEAD AND STILL FURTHER AFIELD WERE REMAINS OF SKIN AND THIGH BONES CRUSHED ALMOST BEYOND RECOGNITION NO AASVOGEL HAD DONE THIS IT WAS HYENAS WORK
4660-25053-0046 THE HIGH SHOULDERED SLINKING BRUTE WITH JAWS LIKE A STONE CRUSHER ALONE CRACKS BONES LIKE THOSE AND BIGGER ONES WHICH EVEN THE LION CANNOT TACKLE I WALKED BACK A LITTLE WAY AND FOUND THE SCENE OF THE LAST STAND ALL HARROWED BARE
4660-25053-0047 BUT THERE WAS NO SPOOR OF KOODOO OR OF JOCK TO BE SEEN THERE ONLY PRINTS INNUMERABLE OF WILD DOGS HYENAS AND JACKALS AND SOME TRACES OF WHERE THE CARCASE NO DOUBT ALREADY HALF EATEN HAD BEEN DRAGGED BY THEM IN THE EFFORT TO TEAR IT ASUNDER
4660-25053-0048 JOCK HAD SEVERAL TIMES SHOWN THAT HE STRONGLY OBJECTED TO ANY INTERFERENCE WITH HIS QUARRY OTHER DOGS KAFFIRS AND EVEN WHITE MEN HAD SUFFERED OR BEEN BADLY SCARED FOR RASHLY LAYING HANDS ON WHAT HE HAD PULLED DOWN
4660-25053-0049 OTHERWISE HE WOULD NOT HAVE TACKLED THEM WITHOUT WORD FROM ME IT WAS ALSO SURE THAT UNTIL PAST MIDNIGHT HE HAD BEEN THERE WITH THE KOODOO WATCHING OR FIGHTING THEN WHEN HAD THE HYENAS AND WILD DOGS COME
4660-25053-0050 I LOOKED AT HIM THE MANE ON HIS NECK AND SHOULDERS WHICH HAD RISEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE VULTURES WAS NOT FLAT YET HE WAS SNIFFING ABOUT SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY ON THE SPOOR OF THE HYENAS AND WILD DOGS AND HE LOOKED FIGHT ALL OVER
