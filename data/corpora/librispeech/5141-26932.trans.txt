5141-26932-0000 BARTOLOMMEO SCALA SECRETARY OF THE FLORENTINE REPUBLIC ON WHOM TITO MELEMA HAD BEEN THUS LED TO ANCHOR HIS HOPES LIVED IN A HANDSOME PALACE CLOSE TO THE PORTA PINTI NOW KNOWN AS THE CASA GHERARDESCA
5141-26932-0001 HIS ARMS AN AZURE LADDER TRANSVERSE ON A GOLDEN FIELD WITH THE MOTTO GRADATIM PLACED OVER THE ENTRANCE TOLD ALL COMERS THAT THE MILLER'S SON HELD HIS ASCENT TO HONOURS BY HIS OWN EFFORTS
5141-26932-0002 THE SECRETARY WAS A VAIN AND POMPOUS MAN BUT HE WAS ALSO AN HONEST ONE HE WAS SINCERELY CONVINCED OF HIS OWN MERIT AND COULD SEE NO REASON FOR FEIGNING THE TOPMOST ROUND OF HIS AZURE LADDER HAD BEEN REACHED BY THIS TIME HE HAD HELD HIS SECRETARYSHIP THESE TWENTY YEARS
5141-26932-0003 HAD LONG SINCE MADE HIS ORATIONS ON THE RINGHIERA
5141-26932-0004 WHILE MARZOCCO THE REPUBLICAN LION WORE HIS GOLD CROWN ON THE OCCASION AND ALL THE PEOPLE CRIED VIVA MESSER BARTOLOMMEO HAD BEEN ON AN EMBASSY TO ROME AND HAD THERE BEEN MADE TITULAR SENATOR APOSTOLICAL SECRETARY KNIGHT OF THE GOLDEN SPUR
5141-26932-0005 AND HAD EIGHT YEARS AGO BEEN GONFALONIERE LAST GOAL OF THE FLORENTINE CITIZEN'S AMBITION MEANTIME HE HAD GOT RICHER AND RICHER AND MORE AND MORE GOUTY AFTER THE MANNER OF SUCCESSFUL MORTALITY AND THE KNIGHT OF THE GOLDEN SPUR HAD OFTEN TO SIT WITH HELPLESS CUSHIONED HEEL
5141-26932-0006 OVERLOOKING THE SPACIOUS GARDENS AND LAWN AT THE BACK OF HIS PALACE HE WAS IN THIS POSITION ON THE DAY WHEN HE HAD GRANTED THE DESIRED INTERVIEW TO TITO MELEMA
5141-26932-0007 THE MAY AFTERNOON SUN WAS ON THE FLOWERS AND THE GRASS BEYOND THE PLEASANT SHADE OF THE LOGGIA THE TOO STATELY SILK LUCCO WAS CAST ASIDE AND THE LIGHT LOOSE MANTLE WAS THROWN OVER HIS TUNIC HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER ALESSANDRA AND HER HUSBAND THE GREEK SOLDIER POET MARULLO
5141-26932-0008 WERE SEATED ON ONE SIDE OF HIM ON THE OTHER TWO FRIENDS NOT OPPRESSIVELY ILLUSTRIOUS AND THEREFORE THE BETTER LISTENERS YET TO SAY NOTHING OF THE GOUT MESSER BARTOLOMMEO'S FELICITY WAS FAR FROM PERFECT IT WAS EMBITTERED BY THE CONTENTS OF CERTAIN PAPERS THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
5141-26932-0009 CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND POLITIAN IT WAS A HUMAN FOIBLE AT THAT PERIOD INCREDIBLE AS IT MAY SEEM TO RECITE QUARRELS AND FAVOUR SCHOLARLY VISITORS WITH THE COMMUNICATION OF AN ENTIRE AND LENGTHY CORRESPONDENCE
5141-26932-0010 AND THIS WAS NEITHER THE FIRST NOR THE SECOND TIME THAT SCALA HAD ASKED THE CANDID OPINION OF HIS FRIENDS AS TO THE BALANCE OF RIGHT AND WRONG IN SOME HALF SCORE LATIN LETTERS BETWEEN HIMSELF AND POLITIAN ALL SPRINGING OUT OF CERTAIN EPIGRAMS WRITTEN IN THE MOST PLAYFUL TONE IN THE WORLD
5141-26932-0011 IT WAS THE STORY OF A VERY TYPICAL AND PRETTY QUARREL IN WHICH WE ARE INTERESTED BECAUSE IT SUPPLIED PRECISELY THAT THISTLE OF HATRED NECESSARY ACCORDING TO NELLO AS A STIMULUS TO THE SLUGGISH PACES OF THE CAUTIOUS STEED FRIENDSHIP POLITIAN
5141-26932-0012 KEPT A VERY SHARP AND LEARNED TOOTH IN READINESS AGAINST THE TOO PROSPEROUS AND PRESUMPTUOUS SECRETARY WHO HAD DECLINED THE GREATEST SCHOLAR OF THE AGE FOR A SON IN LAW SCALA WAS A MERITORIOUS PUBLIC SERVANT AND MOREOVER A LUCKY MAN NATURALLY EXASPERATING TO AN OFFENDED SCHOLAR
5141-26932-0013 BUT THEN O BEAUTIFUL BALANCE OF THINGS HE HAD AN ITCH FOR AUTHORSHIP AND WAS A BAD WRITER ONE OF THOSE EXCELLENT PEOPLE WHO SITTING IN GOUTY SLIPPERS PENNED POETICAL TRIFLES ENTIRELY FOR THEIR OWN AMUSEMENT WITHOUT ANY VIEW TO AN AUDIENCE
5141-26932-0014 AND CONSEQUENTLY SENT THEM TO THEIR FRIENDS IN LETTERS WHICH WERE THE LITERARY PERIODICALS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
5141-26932-0015 FRIENDS LIKE FICINO AND LANDINO
5141-26932-0016 WHO FOUND HIS LATIN PROSE STYLE ELEGANT AND MASCULINE AND THE TERRIBLE JOSEPH SCALIGER WHO WAS TO PRONOUNCE HIM TOTALLY IGNORANT OF LATINITY WAS AT A COMFORTABLE DISTANCE IN THE NEXT CENTURY
5141-26932-0017 BUT WHEN WAS THE FATAL COQUETRY INHERENT IN SUPERFLUOUS AUTHORSHIP EVER QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE READY PRAISE OF FRIENDS THAT CRITICAL SUPERCILIOUS POLITIAN A FELLOW BROWSER WHO WAS FAR FROM AMIABLE
5141-26932-0018 MUST BE MADE AWARE THAT THE SOLID SECRETARY SHOWED IN HIS LEISURE HOURS A PLEASANT FERTILITY IN VERSES WHICH INDICATED PRETTY CLEARLY HOW MUCH HE MIGHT DO IN THAT WAY IF HE WERE NOT A MAN OF AFFAIRS INEFFABLE MOMENT WHEN THE MAN YOU SECRETLY HATE SENDS YOU A LATIN EPIGRAM WITH A FALSE GENDER
5141-26932-0019 ATTEMPTS AT POETIC FIGURES WHICH ARE MANIFEST SOLECISMS THAT MOMENT HAD COME TO POLITIAN THE SECRETARY HAD PUT FORTH HIS SOFT HEAD FROM THE OFFICIAL SHELL AND THE TERRIBLE LURKING CRAB WAS DOWN UPON HIM POLITIAN HAD USED THE FREEDOM OF A FRIEND
5141-26932-0020 CORRECTED THE MISTAKE OF SCALA IN MAKING THE CULEX AN INSECT TOO WELL KNOWN ON THE BANKS OF THE ARNO OF THE INFERIOR OR FEMININE GENDER SCALA REPLIED BY A BAD JOKE IN SUITABLE LATIN VERSES REFERRING TO POLITIAN'S UNSUCCESSFUL SUIT BETTER AND BETTER
5141-26932-0021 POLITIAN FOUND THE VERSES VERY PRETTY AND HIGHLY FACETIOUS THE MORE WAS THE PITY THAT THEY WERE SERIOUSLY INCORRECT AND INASMUCH AS SCALA HAD ALLEGED THAT HE HAD WRITTEN THEM IN IMITATION OF A GREEK EPIGRAM POLITIAN BEING ON SUCH FRIENDLY TERMS
5141-26932-0022 WOULD ENCLOSE A GREEK EPIGRAM OF HIS OWN ON THE SAME INTERESTING INSECT NOT WE MAY PRESUME OUT OF ANY WISH TO HUMBLE SCALA BUT RATHER TO INSTRUCT HIM SAID EPIGRAM CONTAINING A LIVELY CONCEIT ABOUT VENUS CUPID AND THE CULEX OF A KIND MUCH TASTED AT THAT PERIOD
5141-26932-0023 FOUNDED PARTLY ON THE ZOOLOGICAL FACT THAT THE GNAT LIKE VENUS WAS BORN FROM THE WATERS SCALA IN REPLY BEGGED TO SAY THAT HIS VERSES WERE NEVER INTENDED FOR A SCHOLAR WITH SUCH DELICATE OLFACTORIES AS POLITIAN
5141-26932-0024 NEAREST OF ALL LIVING MEN TO THE PERFECTION OF THE ANCIENTS AND OF A TASTE SO FASTIDIOUS THAT STURGEON ITSELF MUST SEEM INSIPID TO HIM DEFENDED HIS OWN VERSES NEVERTHELESS THOUGH INDEED THEY WERE WRITTEN HASTILY WITHOUT CORRECTION
5141-26932-0025 AND INTENDED AS AN AGREEABLE DISTRACTION DURING THE SUMMER HEAT TO HIMSELF AND SUCH FRIENDS AS WERE SATISFIED WITH MEDIOCRITY HE SCALA NOT BEING LIKE SOME OTHER PEOPLE WHO COURTED PUBLICITY THROUGH THE BOOKSELLERS FOR THE REST
5141-26932-0026 HE HAD BARELY ENOUGH GREEK TO MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF THE EPIGRAM SO GRACIOUSLY SENT HIM TO SAY NOTHING OF TASTING ITS ELEGANCES BUT THE EPIGRAM WAS POLITIAN'S WHAT MORE NEED BE SAID STILL
5141-26932-0027 ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ORIGIN FROM THE WATERS WAS IN MANY WAYS TICKLISH ON THE ONE HAND VENUS MIGHT BE OFFENDED
5141-26932-0028 THAT COLD AND DAMP ORIGIN SEEMED DOUBTFUL TO SCALA IN THE CASE OF A CREATURE SO FOND OF WARMTH A FISH WERE PERHAPS THE BETTER COMPARISON OR WHEN THE POWER OF FLYING WAS IN QUESTION AN EAGLE
5141-26932-0029 OR INDEED WHEN THE DARKNESS WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION A BAT OR AN OWL WERE A LESS OBSCURE AND MORE APPOSITE PARALLEL ETCETERA ETCETERA HERE WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR POLITIAN HE WAS NOT AWARE HE WROTE
5141-26932-0030 THAT WHEN HE HAD SCALA'S VERSES PLACED BEFORE HIM THERE WAS ANY QUESTION OF STURGEON BUT RATHER OF FROGS AND GUDGEONS MADE SHORT WORK WITH SCALA'S DEFENCE OF HIS OWN LATIN AND MANGLED HIM TERRIBLY ON THE SCORE OF THE STUPID CRITICISMS HE HAD VENTURED ON THE GREEK EPIGRAM KINDLY FORWARDED TO HIM AS A MODEL
5141-26932-0031 WRETCHED CAVILS INDEED FOR AS TO THE DAMP ORIGIN OF THE GNAT THERE WAS THE AUTHORITY OF VIRGIL HIMSELF WHO HAD CALLED IT THE ALUMNUS OF THE WATERS AND AS TO WHAT HIS DEAR DULL FRIEND HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE FISH THE EAGLE AND THE REST
5141-26932-0032 HE WAS ASHAMED HOWEVER TO DWELL ON SUCH TRIVIALITIES AND THUS TO SWELL A GNAT INTO AN ELEPHANT BUT FOR HIS OWN PART WOULD ONLY ADD THAT HE HAD NOTHING DECEITFUL OR DOUBLE ABOUT HIM NEITHER WAS HE TO BE CAUGHT WHEN PRESENT BY THE FALSE BLANDISHMENTS OF THOSE WHO SLANDERED HIM IN HIS ABSENCE
5141-26932-0033 AGREEING RATHER WITH A HOMERIC SENTIMENT ON THAT HEAD WHICH FURNISHED A GREEK QUOTATION TO SERVE AS POWDER TO HIS BULLET THE QUARREL COULD NOT END THERE THE LOGIC COULD HARDLY GET WORSE BUT THE SECRETARY GOT MORE POMPOUSLY SELF ASSERTING AND THE SCHOLARLY POET'S TEMPER MORE AND MORE VENOMOUS
5141-26932-0034 POLITIAN HAD BEEN GENEROUSLY WILLING TO HOLD UP A MIRROR BY WHICH THE TOO INFLATED SECRETARY BEHOLDING HIS OWN LIKENESS MIGHT BE INDUCED TO CEASE SETTING UP HIS IGNORANT DEFENCES OF BAD LATIN AGAINST ANCIENT AUTHORITIES WHOM THE CONSENT OF CENTURIES HAD PLACED BEYOND QUESTION
5141-26932-0035 UNLESS INDEED HE HAD DESIGNED TO SINK IN LITERATURE IN PROPORTION AS HE ROSE IN HONOURS THAT BY A SORT OF COMPENSATION MEN OF LETTERS MIGHT FEEL THEMSELVES HIS EQUALS IN RETURN POLITIAN WAS BEGGED TO EXAMINE SCALA'S WRITINGS
5141-26932-0036 NOWHERE WOULD HE FIND A MORE DEVOUT ADMIRATION OF ANTIQUITY THE SECRETARY WAS ASHAMED OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED AND BLUSHED FOR IT SOME INDEED THERE WERE WHO WANTED TO HAVE THEIR OWN WORKS PRAISED AND EXALTED TO A LEVEL WITH THE DIVINE MONUMENTS OF ANTIQUITY BUT HE SCALA
5141-26932-0037 COULD NOT OBLIGE THEM AND AS TO THE HONOURS WHICH WERE OFFENSIVE TO THE ENVIOUS THEY HAD BEEN WELL EARNED WITNESS HIS WHOLE LIFE SINCE HE CAME IN PENURY TO FLORENCE THE ELEGANT SCHOLAR IN REPLY
5141-26932-0038 WAS NOT SURPRISED THAT SCALA FOUND THE AGE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM SINCE HE HIMSELF WAS SO DISTASTEFUL TO THE AGE NAY IT WAS WITH PERFECT ACCURACY THAT HE THE ELEGANT SCHOLAR HAD CALLED SCALA A BRANNY MONSTER
5141-26932-0039 IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO TITO'S APPOINTED VISIT THAT THE PAPERS CONTAINING THIS CORRESPONDENCE WERE BROUGHT OUT TO DAY HERE WAS A NEW GREEK SCHOLAR WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE TO BE TESTED AND ON NOTHING DID SCALA MORE DESIRE A DISPASSIONATE OPINION FROM PERSONS OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
5141-26932-0040 THAN ON THAT GREEK EPIGRAM OF POLITIAN'S AFTER SUFFICIENT INTRODUCTORY TALK CONCERNING TITO'S TRAVELS AFTER A SURVEY AND DISCUSSION OF THE GEMS AND AN EASY PASSAGE FROM THE MENTION OF THE LAMENTED LORENZO'S EAGERNESS IN COLLECTING SUCH SPECIMENS OF ANCIENT ART
5141-26932-0041 TO THE SUBJECT OF CLASSICAL TASTES AND STUDIES IN GENERAL AND THEIR PRESENT CONDITION IN FLORENCE IT WAS INEVITABLE TO MENTION POLITIAN A MAN OF EMINENT ABILITY INDEED BUT A LITTLE TOO ARROGANT ASSUMING TO BE A HERCULES WHOSE OFFICE IT WAS TO DESTROY ALL THE LITERARY MONSTROSITIES OF THE AGE
5141-26932-0042 AND WRITING LETTERS TO HIS ELDERS WITHOUT SIGNING THEM AS IF THEY WERE MIRACULOUS REVELATIONS THAT COULD ONLY HAVE ONE SOURCE AND AFTER ALL WERE NOT HIS OWN CRITICISMS OFTEN QUESTIONABLE AND HIS TASTES PERVERSE
5141-26932-0043 BUT WHILE HE WAS BOASTING OF HIS FREEDOM FROM SERVILE IMITATION DID HE NOT FALL INTO THE OTHER EXTREME RUNNING AFTER STRANGE WORDS AND AFFECTED PHRASES EVEN IN HIS MUCH BELAUDED MISCELLANEA WAS EVERY POINT TENABLE
5141-26932-0044 AND TITO WHO HAD JUST BEEN LOOKING INTO THE MISCELLANEA FOUND SO MUCH TO SAY THAT WAS AGREEABLE TO THE SECRETARY
5141-26932-0045 THAT HE SHOWED HIMSELF QUITE WORTHY TO BE MADE A JUDGE IN THE NOTABLE CORRESPONDENCE CONCERNING THE CULEX HERE WAS THE GREEK EPIGRAM WHICH POLITIAN HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT THE FINEST IN THE WORLD THOUGH HE HAD PRETENDED TO BELIEVE THAT THE TRANSMARINI THE GREEKS THEMSELVES WOULD MAKE LIGHT OF IT
5141-26932-0046 HAD HE NOT BEEN UNINTENTIONALLY SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN HIS FALSE MODESTY TITO WAS READY AND SCARIFIED THE EPIGRAM TO SCALA'S CONTENT O WISE YOUNG JUDGE HE COULD DOUBTLESS APPRECIATE SATIRE EVEN IN THE VULGAR TONGUE AND SCALA
5141-26932-0047 WHO EXCELLENT MAN NOT SEEKING PUBLICITY THROUGH THE BOOKSELLERS WAS NEVER UNPROVIDED WITH HASTY UNCORRECTED TRIFLES AS A SORT OF SHERBET FOR A VISITOR ON A HOT DAY OR IF THE WEATHER WERE COLD WHY THEN AS A CORDIAL
5141-26932-0048 HAD A FEW LITTLE MATTERS IN THE SHAPE OF SONNETS TURNING ON WELL KNOWN FOIBLES OF POLITIAN'S WHICH HE WOULD NOT LIKE TO GO ANY FARTHER BUT WHICH WOULD PERHAPS AMUSE THE COMPANY ENOUGH
