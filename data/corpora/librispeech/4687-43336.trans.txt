4687-43336-0000 AND AS FOR HIMSELF WHAT HAD HE TO SAY TO ALL THIS A TRANSCENDENT GOD WHO HID HIMSELF A DIVINE SAVIOUR WHO DELAYED TO COME A COMFORTER HEARD NO LONGER IN WIND NOR SEEN IN FIRE
4687-43336-0001 THERE IN THE NEXT ROOM WAS A LITTLE WOODEN ALTAR AND ABOVE IT AN IRON BOX AND WITHIN THAT BOX A SILVER CUP AND WITHIN THAT CUP SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
4687-43336-0002 A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY LAY THE DOMES AND PLASTER ROOFS OF A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED NAZARETH CARMEL WAS ON THE RIGHT A MILE OR TWO AWAY THABOR ON THE LEFT THE PLAIN OF ESDRAELON IN FRONT AND BEHIND CANA AND GALILEE
4687-43336-0003 AND THE QUIET LAKE AND HERMON AND FAR AWAY TO THE SOUTH LAY JERUSALEM IT WAS TO THIS TINY STRIP OF HOLY LAND THAT THE POPE HAD COME THE LAND WHERE A FAITH HAD SPROUTED TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND WHERE
4687-43336-0004 UNLESS GOD SPOKE IN FIRE FROM HEAVEN IT WOULD PRESENTLY BE CUT DOWN AS A CUMBERER OF THE GROUND IT WAS HERE ON THIS MATERIAL EARTH THAT ONE HAD WALKED WHOM ALL MEN HAD THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HE WHO WOULD REDEEM ISRAEL
4687-43336-0005 IN THIS VILLAGE THAT HE HAD FETCHED WATER AND MADE BOXES AND CHAIRS ON THAT LONG LAKE THAT HIS FEET HAD WALKED ON THAT HIGH HILL THAT HE HAD FLAMED IN GLORY ON THAT SMOOTH LOW MOUNTAIN TO THE NORTH
4687-43336-0006 THAT HE HAD DECLARED THAT THE MEEK WERE BLESSED AND SHOULD INHERIT THE EARTH THAT PEACEMAKERS WERE THE CHILDREN OF GOD
4687-43336-0007 SHOULD BE SATISFIED AND NOW IT WAS COME TO THIS CHRISTIANITY HAD SMOULDERED AWAY FROM EUROPE LIKE A SUNSET ON DARKENING PEAKS ETERNAL ROME WAS A HEAP OF RUINS IN EAST AND WEST ALIKE
4687-43336-0008 A MAN HAD BEEN SET UPON THE THRONE OF GOD HAD BEEN ACCLAIMED AS DIVINE THE WORLD HAD LEAPED FORWARD SOCIAL SCIENCE WAS SUPREME MEN HAD LEARNED CONSISTENCY THEY HAD LEARNED TOO
4687-43336-0009 THE SOCIAL LESSONS OF CHRISTIANITY APART FROM A DIVINE TEACHER OR RATHER THEY SAID IN SPITE OF HIM THERE WERE LEFT PERHAPS THREE MILLIONS PERHAPS FIVE AT THE UTMOST TEN MILLIONS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW
4687-43336-0010 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE INHABITED GLOBE WHO STILL WORSHIPPED JESUS CHRIST AS GOD AND THE VICAR OF CHRIST SAT IN A WHITEWASHED ROOM IN NAZARETH DRESSED AS SIMPLY AS HIS MASTER WAITING FOR THE END HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD
4687-43336-0011 THERE WERE LEFT THREE CARDINALS ALIVE HIMSELF STEINMANN AND THE PATRIARCH OF JERUSALEM THE REST LAY MANGLED SOMEWHERE IN THE RUINS OF ROME THERE WAS NO PRECEDENT TO FOLLOW
4687-43336-0012 SO THE TWO EUROPEANS HAD MADE THEIR WAY OUT TO THE EAST AND TO THE ONE TOWN IN IT WHERE QUIET STILL REIGNED WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF GREEK CHRISTIANITY
4687-43336-0013 AND BY A KIND OF TACIT CONSENT OF THE WORLD CHRISTIANS WERE ALLOWED A MODERATE LIBERTY IN PALESTINE RUSSIA WHICH NOW HELD THE COUNTRY AS A DEPENDENCY HAD SUFFICIENT SENTIMENT LEFT TO LEAVE IT ALONE
4687-43336-0014 IT WAS TRUE THAT THE HOLY PLACES HAD BEEN DESECRATED AND REMAINED NOW ONLY AS SPOTS OF ANTIQUARIAN INTEREST THE ALTARS WERE GONE
4687-43336-0015 AND ALTHOUGH MASS COULD NO LONGER BE SAID THERE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT PRIVATE ORATORIES WERE NOT FORBIDDEN IT WAS IN THIS STATE THAT THE TWO EUROPEAN CARDINALS HAD FOUND THE HOLY CITY
4687-43336-0016 IT WAS NOT THOUGHT WISE TO WEAR INSIGNIA OF ANY DESCRIPTION IN PUBLIC AND IT WAS PRACTICALLY CERTAIN EVEN NOW THAT THE CIVILISED WORLD WAS UNAWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE FOR WITHIN THREE DAYS OF THEIR ARRIVAL THE OLD PATRIARCH HAD DIED
4687-43336-0017 YET NOT BEFORE PERCY FRANKLIN SURELY UNDER THE STRANGEST CIRCUMSTANCES SINCE THOSE OF THE FIRST CENTURY HAD BEEN ELECTED TO THE SUPREME PONTIFICATE IT HAD ALL BEEN DONE IN A FEW MINUTES BY THE DYING MAN'S BEDSIDE
4687-43336-0018 THE TWO OLD MEN HAD INSISTED
4687-43336-0019 AND HAD MURMURED HIS OLD HALF HEARD REMARKS ABOUT THE ANTITHESIS AND THE FINGER OF GOD AND PERCY MARVELLING AT HIS SUPERSTITION HAD ACCEPTED AND THE ELECTION WAS RECORDED HE HAD TAKEN THE NAME OF SILVESTER
4687-43336-0020 THE LAST SAINT IN THE YEAR AND WAS THE THIRD OF THAT TITLE HE HAD THEN RETIRED TO NAZARETH WITH HIS CHAPLAIN STEINMANN HAD GONE BACK TO GERMANY AND BEEN HANGED IN A RIOT WITHIN A FORTNIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL
4687-43336-0021 THE NEXT MATTER WAS THE CREATION OF NEW CARDINALS AND TO TWENTY PERSONS WITH INFINITE PRECAUTIONS BRIEFS HAD BEEN CONVEYED OF THESE NINE HAD DECLINED THREE MORE HAD BEEN APPROACHED OF WHOM ONLY ONE HAD ACCEPTED
4687-43336-0022 THERE WERE THEREFORE AT THIS MOMENT TWELVE PERSONS IN THE WORLD WHO CONSTITUTED THE SACRED COLLEGE TWO ENGLISHMEN OF WHOM CORKRAN WAS ONE TWO AMERICANS A FRENCHMAN A GERMAN AN ITALIAN A SPANIARD A POLE
4687-43336-0023 A CHINAMAN A GREEK AND A RUSSIAN TO THESE WERE ENTRUSTED VAST DISTRICTS OVER WHICH THEIR CONTROL WAS SUPREME SUBJECT ONLY TO THE HOLY FATHER HIMSELF AS REGARDED THE POPE'S OWN LIFE VERY LITTLE NEED BE SAID
4687-43336-0024 IT RESEMBLED HE THOUGHT IN ITS OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OF SUCH A MAN AS LEO THE GREAT WITHOUT HIS WORLDLY IMPORTANCE OR POMP THEORETICALLY THE CHRISTIAN WORLD WAS UNDER HIS DOMINION PRACTICALLY CHRISTIAN AFFAIRS WERE ADMINISTERED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES
4687-43336-0025 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A HUNDRED REASONS FOR HIM TO DO WHAT HE WISHED WITH REGARD TO THE EXCHANGE OF COMMUNICATIONS AN ELABORATE CYPHER HAD BEEN DESIGNED AND A PRIVATE TELEGRAPHIC STATION ORGANISED ON HIS ROOF
4687-43336-0026 COMMUNICATING WITH ANOTHER IN DAMASCUS WHERE CARDINAL CORKRAN HAD FIXED HIS RESIDENCE AND FROM THAT CENTRE MESSAGES OCCASIONALLY WERE DESPATCHED TO ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITIES ELSEWHERE BUT FOR THE MOST PART THERE WAS LITTLE TO BE DONE
4687-43336-0027 THE POPE HOWEVER HAD THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT WITH INCREDIBLE DIFFICULTY A LITTLE PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE TOWARDS THE REORGANISATION OF THE HIERARCHY IN ALL COUNTRIES BISHOPS WERE BEING CONSECRATED FREELY
4687-43336-0028 THERE WERE NOT LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND OF THEM ALL TOLD AND OF PRIESTS AN UNKNOWN NUMBER THE ORDER OF CHRIST CRUCIFIED WAS DOING EXCELLENT WORK AND THE TALES OF NOT LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED MARTYRDOMS HAD REACHED NAZARETH DURING THE LAST TWO MONTHS
4687-43336-0029 ACCOMPLISHED MOSTLY AT THE HANDS OF THE MOBS IN OTHER RESPECTS ALSO AS WELL AS IN THE PRIMARY OBJECT OF THE ORDER'S EXISTENCE NAMELY THE AFFORDING OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALL WHO LOVED GOD TO DEDICATE THEMSELVES TO HIM MORE PERFECTLY
4687-43336-0030 THE NEW RELIGIOUS WERE DOING GOOD WORK THE MORE PERILOUS TASKS THE WORK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PRELATES MISSIONS TO PERSONS OF SUSPECTED INTEGRITY ALL THE BUSINESS IN FACT WHICH WAS CARRIED ON NOW AT THE VITAL RISK OF THE AGENT
4687-43336-0031 WERE ENTRUSTED SOLELY TO MEMBERS OF THE ORDER STRINGENT INSTRUCTIONS HAD BEEN ISSUED FROM NAZARETH THAT NO BISHOP WAS TO EXPOSE HIMSELF UNNECESSARILY EACH WAS TO REGARD HIMSELF AS THE HEART OF HIS DIOCESE
4687-43336-0032 TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS SAVE THAT OF CHRISTIAN HONOUR AND IN CONSEQUENCE EACH HAD SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH A GROUP OF THE NEW RELIGIOUS MEN AND WOMEN WHO WITH EXTRAORDINARY AND GENEROUS OBEDIENCE
4687-43336-0033 UNDERTOOK SUCH DANGEROUS TASKS AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH BY NOW THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ORDER
4687-43336-0034 EXTRAORDINARY FACILITIES WERE BEING ISSUED IN ALL DIRECTIONS EVERY PRIEST WHO BELONGED TO THE ORDER RECEIVED UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION SUBJECT TO THE BISHOP IF ANY OF THE DIOCESE IN WHICH HE MIGHT BE
4687-43336-0035 MASS MIGHT BE SAID ON ANY DAY OF THE YEAR OF THE FIVE WOUNDS OR THE RESURRECTION OR OUR LADY AND ALL HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF THE PORTABLE ALTAR NOW PERMITTED TO BE WOOD FURTHER RITUAL REQUIREMENTS WERE RELAXED
4687-43336-0036 MASS MIGHT BE SAID WITH ANY DECENT VESSELS OF ANY MATERIAL CAPABLE OF DESTRUCTION SUCH AS GLASS OR CHINA BREAD OF ANY DESCRIPTION MIGHT BE USED AND NO VESTMENTS WERE OBLIGATORY EXCEPT THE THIN THREAD THAT NOW REPRESENTED THE STOLE
4687-43336-0037 LIGHTS WERE NON ESSENTIAL NONE NEED WEAR THE CLERICAL HABIT AND ROSARY EVEN WITHOUT BEADS WAS ALWAYS PERMISSIBLE INSTEAD OF THE OFFICE
4687-43336-0038 IN THIS MANNER PRIESTS WERE RENDERED CAPABLE OF GIVING THE SACRAMENTS AND OFFERING THE HOLY SACRIFICE AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE RISK TO THEMSELVES
4687-43336-0039 WHERE BY THIS TIME MANY THOUSANDS OF CATHOLICS WERE UNDERGOING THE PENALTY OF REFUSING PUBLIC WORSHIP THE POPE'S PRIVATE LIFE WAS AS SIMPLE AS HIS ROOM HE HAD ONE SYRIAN PRIEST FOR HIS CHAPLAIN AND TWO SYRIAN SERVANTS
4687-43336-0040 HE SAID HIS MASS EACH MORNING HIMSELF WEARING VESTMENTS AND HIS WHITE HABIT BENEATH AND HEARD A MASS AFTER HE THEN TOOK HIS COFFEE AFTER CHANGING INTO THE TUNIC AND BURNOUS OF THE COUNTRY AND SPENT THE MORNING OVER BUSINESS
4687-43336-0041 HE DINED AT NOON SLEPT AND RODE OUT FOR THE COUNTRY BY REASON OF ITS INDETERMINATE POSITION WAS STILL IN THE SIMPLICITY OF A HUNDRED YEARS AGO HE RETURNED AT DUSK SUPPED AND WORKED AGAIN TILL LATE INTO THE NIGHT
4687-43336-0042 THAT WAS ALL HIS CHAPLAIN SENT WHAT MESSAGES WERE NECESSARY TO DAMASCUS HIS SERVANTS THEMSELVES IGNORANT OF HIS DIGNITY DEALT WITH THE SECULAR WORLD SO FAR AS WAS REQUIRED AND THE UTMOST THAT SEEMED TO BE KNOWN TO HIS FEW NEIGHBOURS
4687-43336-0043 WAS THAT THERE LIVED IN THE LATE SHEIKH'S LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILL AN ECCENTRIC EUROPEAN WITH A TELEGRAPH OFFICE HIS SERVANTS THEMSELVES DEVOUT CATHOLICS KNEW HIM FOR A BISHOP BUT NO MORE THAN THAT
4687-43336-0044 THEY WERE TOLD ONLY THAT THERE WAS YET A POPE ALIVE AND WITH THAT AND THE SACRAMENTS WERE CONTENT TO SUM UP THEREFORE THE CATHOLIC WORLD KNEW THAT THEIR POPE LIVED UNDER THE NAME OF SILVESTER AND THIRTEEN PERSONS OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE
4687-43336-0045 KNEW THAT FRANKLIN HAD BEEN HIS NAME AND THAT THE THRONE OF PETER RESTED FOR THE TIME IN NAZARETH IT WAS AS A FRENCHMAN HAD SAID JUST A HUNDRED YEARS AGO CATHOLICISM SURVIVED
